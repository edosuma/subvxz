00:02.062 --> 00:03.717
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.718 --> 00:05.428
The spell the Travelers
cast across Mystic Falls

00:05.429 --> 00:07.023
eliminates spirit magic.

00:07.024 --> 00:09.225
Aah! Uhh! Uhh!

00:10.450 --> 00:14.282
The other side is collapsing
and everyone in it is going away.

00:14.283 --> 00:15.798
What about you?
What happens?

00:15.800 --> 00:17.881
Jeremy, I'll be fine.

00:17.882 --> 00:19.786
When the Travelers die,
Liv will do the spell,

00:19.787 --> 00:21.720
and her magic will allow
the people on the other side

00:21.721 --> 00:22.948
to push their way through.

00:23.452 --> 00:25.524
- Damon...
- I know.

00:27.678 --> 00:28.794
[Screaming]

00:29.797 --> 00:31.598
My God.
Alaric, what are you...

00:31.599 --> 00:33.133
Come on.
You gotta go.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.294
- What about Damon?
- You need to go home to your brother.

00:35.295 --> 00:36.549
I'll find Damon.

00:36.550 --> 00:39.305
I can't find Damon.
I'm not leaving without him.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.224
I won't let you die for them.

00:41.225 --> 00:43.359
Phasmatos fumas extas.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.136
We need to start the spell again.

00:46.137 --> 00:48.481
- We can't. That was our one shot.
- But Damon's on the other side.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.451
Elena. You can say good-bye.

00:51.452 --> 00:54.069
Damon finally had
everything he wanted.

00:54.071 --> 00:56.655
He was happy.
He should be here.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.125
It was all a lie.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.327
You told me you could come back.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.411
I love you.

01:02.413 --> 01:03.967
Bonnie, don't you dare...

01:04.340 --> 01:05.799
Elena: Please don't leave me.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.052
I love you, Elena.
Bye.

01:10.053 --> 01:12.671
Bonnie!
Bonnie!

01:14.008 --> 01:15.574
Do you think it'll hurt?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.610
I don't know.

01:24.282 --> 01:26.653
[Buzzing]

01:26.654 --> 01:28.820
[Music playing]

01:40.334 --> 01:41.885
[Whispering]
What the hell was that?

01:41.886 --> 01:43.219
I have no idea.

01:43.220 --> 01:46.388
- Go out there and check it out.
- You go out there and check it out.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.630
Hey, I got the lan...
Aah!

02:31.599 --> 02:35.355
Oh, my God.
Sheriff Forbes.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.390
I thought you were a serial killer.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.726
Worse, actually, because

02:39.727 --> 02:42.383
you'll still be alive
when I call your parents.

02:42.443 --> 02:45.365
Pack it up and strike it down.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.699
I'm like, for real, sheriff Forbes?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.034
You got nothing better to do

02:48.035 --> 02:50.570
than to bust us for
a couple of beer cans?

02:50.571 --> 02:52.238
[Scoffs] Tax money at work.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.455
Girl: It could've been worse.

02:53.457 --> 02:56.557
Melanie Peterson was arrested
for underage drinking last week.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.295
I swear this place is turning into
that town from "Footloose."

03:01.799 --> 03:04.416
Yeah, well, let's just
get out of here.

03:13.677 --> 03:14.893
Jessie?

03:19.486 --> 03:20.440
Yo, Jessie.

03:22.853 --> 03:23.986
Jessie.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.824
Oh! Oh, Jessie.

03:27.825 --> 03:29.242
[Garbled speech] Shh. Don't talk.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.693
You'll be ok.
I'll get help.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.196
Look. Up.

03:42.869 --> 03:45.758
[Music playing]

03:45.759 --> 03:47.460
Elena, voice-over:
Today was a good day.

03:47.461 --> 03:51.013
Summer is officially over
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.951
Sophomore year.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.269
I guess this is the year
you're supposed to pick a major

03:57.271 --> 04:00.139
and start carving out
your path in life.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.474
So, that's what I did.

04:01.475 --> 04:05.695
You are look at the future
Dr. Elena Gilbert.

04:05.696 --> 04:08.064
So. Pop quiz.

04:08.065 --> 04:11.284
Mr. Weatherly complains of
chest pain and shortness of breath.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.201
Can anyone tell me what tests we run?

04:15.539 --> 04:16.654
Gilbert.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.624
Um...

04:20.160 --> 04:22.662
A pulmonary angiogram
provides a clear picture

04:22.663 --> 04:24.996
of the blood flow in
the arteries and the lungs,

04:24.998 --> 04:27.667
which is what we look for
in a pulmonary embolism,

04:27.668 --> 04:31.219
a condition in which
Mr. Weatherly's symptoms are common.

04:31.221 --> 04:32.554
Good. Someone's read ahead.

04:32.556 --> 04:35.173
Remember that.
You'll need that in 3 years.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.845
Here's the bed pan you
need to know about today.

04:41.312 --> 04:42.564
Moving on.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.685
I was impressed.

04:48.739 --> 04:49.772
Thanks.

04:49.773 --> 04:52.691
Elena, voice-over: Ok, so,
maybe I spent the day observing.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.945
But at least now we have
unlimited access

04:55.946 --> 04:57.330
to blood bank,

04:57.331 --> 05:00.533
and trust me, we need
all the help we can get.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.668
Some of us are still
getting the hang of

05:02.669 --> 05:06.160
the whole drinking other
people's blood thing.

05:12.262 --> 05:13.880
Want some?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.555
It's all right.
I had some on the way over.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.720
You know, this will
never not be weird.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.556
What? That some ancient witch
turned me into a vampire

05:23.557 --> 05:26.192
or that 4 months ago,
I rose from the dead?

05:26.193 --> 05:28.360
That you're my college professor.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.197
Elena, voice-over:
In Alaric's defense,

05:31.198 --> 05:34.616
he couldn't exactly compel himself
a job back at the High School.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.906
Nope, the High School, grill,
the town square...

05:39.907 --> 05:42.074
Thanks to the Travelers'
anti-magic spell,

05:42.075 --> 05:43.743
everything in Mystic Falls

05:43.744 --> 05:45.962
still off-limits to anyone with fangs.

05:45.963 --> 05:48.881
A lot of us haven't been
back home in months.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.585
On the plus side,
the crime rate is way down.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.888
Although I'm not sure
Matt got the memo.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.307
Man: Good move, Donovan.
Proving once again

05:58.308 --> 06:00.426
that self-defense is the best offense.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.762
Elena, voice-over: I will say
he's never been better.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.097
I think he can bench-press
more than Jeremy now,

06:05.098 --> 06:06.898
which is beyond freaky.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.484
Speaking of Jeremy...

06:10.571 --> 06:13.773
Actually, let's not
talk about my brother.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.608
Let's talk about Stefan.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.610
Last I heard, he was
chasing some lead to some

06:17.611 --> 06:18.828
witch that could contact the dead.

06:18.829 --> 06:19.829
[Man whistles]

06:19.830 --> 06:20.780
Man: Hey.

06:20.781 --> 06:24.333
Get your ass in here, kid.
Payday.

06:24.334 --> 06:26.502
Elena, voice-over: We haven't
spoken in months,

06:26.503 --> 06:28.120
which can only mean that his search

06:28.121 --> 06:31.456
for answers to what happened
has been all-consuming.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.965
He's grieving.
He lost so much.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.098
We all did.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.304
But we're all getting
through it in our own way.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.106
I dropped out of Whitmore.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.308
Why would I support
their stupid football team?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.994
Elena: It's the opening game
of the season, Caroline.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.145
Time to come home.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.313
I am home.
I just signed the lease

06:54.314 --> 06:55.781
to my new apartment.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.150
On the border of a town
that doesn't want you.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.319
That's not home.
That's sad.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.954
You don't even like football.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.157
No, but I like drinking in
the parking lot beforehand.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.159
Caroline, you're coming.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.829
Tyler, don't act like you
have any ground to stand on.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.297
You skipped an entire year.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.466
And you hounded me for an entire year.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.335
So, here I am.
Now, get your ass back here.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.970
Caroline, I'm picking
you up at your house

07:17.971 --> 07:19.672
at 6 P.M. sharp tomorrow.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.641
Ok? Bring your school spirit.
Bye. [Hangs up phone]

07:23.727 --> 07:26.178
[Sigh]

07:26.179 --> 07:29.582
Anyway...
As I was saying.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.434
I haven't exactly found a spell

07:31.435 --> 07:33.903
that can undo
an anti-magic border per se,

07:33.904 --> 07:37.290
but this book mentions Travelers,
which isn't that helpful,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.324
but at least it's a step
in the right direction.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.493
- Sweetheart.
- Yeah?

07:40.494 --> 07:43.872
- You should go with them tomorrow.
- No. We're gonna go see a movie.

07:43.873 --> 07:46.749
We have spent
the entire summer together.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.503
[Sigh] God.
You're sick of me.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.039
Caroline, you just lost
one of your best friends.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.675
It makes sense that you want to
hold on to what's familiar,

07:55.676 --> 07:58.928
but Elena lost her, too,
and she clearly misses you.

07:58.929 --> 08:03.799
No. Elena clearly has taken up residency
on planet denial,

08:03.800 --> 08:05.551
where football is more
important than her boyfriend

08:05.552 --> 08:07.803
being swept away into oblivion.

08:07.804 --> 08:10.473
Do you know she's
barely cried for him?

08:10.474 --> 08:13.859
She was a full-on wreck
over Bonnie for months,

08:13.860 --> 08:15.061
but every time I mention Damon,

08:15.062 --> 08:16.479
it's like nothing ever happened.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.115
Caroline,
Elena has experienced more grief

08:19.116 --> 08:20.733
than anyone I've ever met.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.575
You should cut her some slack.
[Cell phone buzzes]

08:23.570 --> 08:26.989
What? Someone trample over
Mr. Davis's flower bed again?

08:26.990 --> 08:28.374
Two kids were admitted to the hospital

08:28.375 --> 08:30.158
with suspicious wounds on their necks.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.544
Vampire attacks? How?

08:32.546 --> 08:34.380
Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.631
No, but they can lurk
around the borders.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.083
I gotta cut lunch short.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.217
I gotta take care of this.
Listen.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.587
Consider Elena's offer, ok?
Mystic Falls isn't going anywhere.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.726
Hey, don't forget your basket.

08:53.483 --> 08:55.851
Elena, voice-over:
She doesn't want to let go.

08:55.852 --> 08:57.102
I get it.

08:59.356 --> 09:00.822
I don't want to let go, either.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.943
I don't want to think
that everything's changed,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.548
that I have to start over.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.081
The worst thing that could
possibly happen actually did.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.132
But I don't have to.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.625
Anyway, that was my day.
How was yours?

09:22.512 --> 09:23.963
Can we go back to the part where

09:23.964 --> 09:27.633
Ric came back to life
to be a college professor?

09:27.634 --> 09:29.768
[Laughs]

09:40.541 --> 09:42.683
"Occult."

09:42.684 --> 09:46.353
The word in its literal
translation means "hidden."

09:46.355 --> 09:48.655
Therefore, the study of the occult...

09:50.976 --> 09:56.030
Therefore, the study of the occult
is the study of hidden knowledge.

09:56.031 --> 10:01.000
Today, we're going to discuss it
as it relates to resurrection.

10:02.371 --> 10:08.174
- Is there something funny, Liv?
- More like ironic, but ok.

10:09.495 --> 10:11.045
Oh, Mr. Lockwood.

10:11.046 --> 10:13.664
How generous of the practice squad
to lend you to us.

10:13.665 --> 10:15.550
Sorry I'm late.

10:15.551 --> 10:19.503
Typically, not all occult groups
held a consensus on the topic.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.487
Sorry, princess.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.123
Just trying to check
what page we're on.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.159
Shh. I'm trying to listen.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.212
Alaric: ...Apostles, the
Athanasian Creeds Tertullian,

10:30.213 --> 10:33.047
and the western church
were inclined to believe

10:33.049 --> 10:34.666
in resurrection of the flesh, whereas

10:34.668 --> 10:36.635
the Gnostics held the firm belief

10:36.636 --> 10:40.004
that resurrection existed
only in a spiritual sense.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.341
Elena, you know I can
smell that, right?

10:46.012 --> 10:47.563
I'm teaching a class full of kids

10:47.564 --> 10:49.348
who all look like
blood sausages to me.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.015
Now, put that away.

10:51.601 --> 10:53.018
Sorry.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.355
Uh, whereas others,
like the early church Fathers.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.324
Luke. Hey.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.575
Hey, I gotta run, actually.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.410
Oh, no, I'll be quick.
Really quick.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.364
I just... I've been
really thirsty lately.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.416
Do you think it's because of the...
You know.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.202
Are you asking me if
there are side effects

11:10.203 --> 11:12.087
to the ancient psychotropic herbs

11:12.088 --> 11:13.706
I've been giving you, because

11:13.707 --> 11:16.041
there haven't exactly
been clinical trials.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.843
Obviously.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.345
I don't... I was just
wondering if maybe

11:19.346 --> 11:21.513
you could, like, I don't know...

11:21.514 --> 11:24.016
Add something to the next batch?

11:24.017 --> 11:28.137
Yeah, or maybe there
shouldn't be a next batch.

11:28.138 --> 11:29.722
What do you mean?

11:29.723 --> 11:33.392
Luke, it was your idea
that I see him again, remember?

11:33.393 --> 11:36.195
You were all, "hey, Elena,
I'm sorry that I wronged you.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.531
I'm sorry that I'm the reason
your boyfriend is dead," remember?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.317
And I am.
I'm sorry.

11:41.318 --> 11:44.119
Something I made clear
when I made Alaric's daytime bracelet,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.287
because you asked.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.739
Yeah, I know.
And when I went against

11:46.740 --> 11:48.457
my coven rules to get these herbs,

11:48.458 --> 11:49.875
- because you asked.
- Right.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.745
But it's time to
return to reality here.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.296
Look, I'm fine.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.414
I'm ok.
I promise.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.751
Just come by my place by 5, ok?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.501
- Elena.
- Thank you.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.758
Hey, Dean.
I think a zero

12:05.759 --> 12:07.509
might've fallen off my paycheck.

12:07.510 --> 12:10.896
- Oh, yeah. I had to dock you 200 bucks.
- For what?

12:10.897 --> 12:13.899
Dan Zimmer said you put a ding
on the hood of his Shelby.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.485
Dan's wife put a ding
on the hood of his Shelby.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.570
That's funny.
Sounds like you're

12:18.571 --> 12:20.571
calling my best customer a liar.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.076
You're ripping me off, Dean.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.268
What you gonna do about it, kid? Huh?

12:26.269 --> 12:29.347
You gonna quit? Run off
to wherever the hell you came from?

12:34.421 --> 12:35.838
That's what I thought.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.455
[Cell phone buzzes]

12:38.425 --> 12:40.676
Hello?
Alaric: Hey. Just checking in

12:40.677 --> 12:42.995
to see if your contact panned out yet.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.264
Still working on it.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.632
Alaric: Good.
Keep me posted.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.875
Let me know how it goes.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.141
You already read all that?

12:56.142 --> 12:58.110
Cover to cover, with no mention

12:58.111 --> 13:00.062
on how to undo an
anti-magic force-field.

13:00.063 --> 13:02.364
And if I'm going to
single-handedly take back our town,

13:02.365 --> 13:04.600
I'm gonna need a little
bit more to go on.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.120
Got it.
All right, well,

13:08.121 --> 13:11.657
I brought "Ancient
Witchcraft, volume two."

13:11.658 --> 13:13.492
I read it.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.496
How about "The Art of Hexing"
and "Elements of Magic"?

13:17.497 --> 13:20.032
Fine. Thank you.

13:23.753 --> 13:27.088
- So, how's Stefan?
- He's ok.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.176
How often do you talk to him?

13:31.177 --> 13:32.728
I don't know.
Couple times a week.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.015
Oh. Huh.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.518
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here, Caroline.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.262
Is something bothering you?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.323
He didn't say good-bye.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.408
Damon and Bonnie died
and he just left.

13:46.409 --> 13:51.030
No phone calls, no e-mails,
just disappeared into thin air.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.532
And I haven't heard
from him in months.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.834
I actually convinced
myself that he was in some

13:55.835 --> 13:59.254
remote mountain region
and couldn't accept my calls.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.673
Or maybe he just
doesn't want to bother you

14:01.674 --> 14:03.875
with every half-lead
that goes nowhere.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.663
Or maybe I just need to get over it.
Thanks for the books.

14:16.139 --> 14:18.357
Elena on phone:
Why isn't Jeremy answering his phone?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.226
I don't know. He's probably
doing homework or something.

14:21.227 --> 14:24.897
Doing homework?
Put me on speaker, please.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.398
[Beep]

14:26.399 --> 14:27.866
Jeremy, I know you can hear me.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.235
Get your butt off that couch
and do something productive.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.954
Or what?
You're gonna come here and make me?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.706
Or I'll have the sheriff arrest you
and drag you to the town border,

14:34.707 --> 14:38.243
where I will kick your ass myself.
Matt, a little help, please.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.878
- Yeah, I'll deal with him.
- Thank you.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.414
[Hangs up phone]
[Sighs]

14:44.584 --> 14:47.469
So. This is it, huh?

14:47.470 --> 14:50.089
Video games.
Random girls.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.257
Drunk by noon every day.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.259
Look, it sucks that
Bonnie's dead, Jer.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.978
I get it.
But you need to start

14:55.979 --> 14:57.823
living your life again.

14:57.824 --> 15:00.099
How? By joining
the community protection squad?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.518
What exactly are you
protecting us from?

15:02.519 --> 15:04.103
Bike theft? Litter?

15:04.104 --> 15:06.271
Magic doesn't work here.
The town's safe.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.773
For now.
But Caroline's

15:07.774 --> 15:09.408
working on a way to reverse all that.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.910
So, it's only a matter of time before
we're dealing with all the problems

15:11.911 --> 15:14.446
that come along with vampires again.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.667
You're a hunter.
You have skills.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.285
Use them.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.838
No more magic means
I'm not a hunter anymore.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.021
[Opens can]

15:26.176 --> 15:27.960
Yeah, you're right, Jer.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.870
You're not much
of anything anymore.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.217
Hey.

15:35.218 --> 15:38.637
Hey. You're home.
I thought you were coming over at 5.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.773
I know you did.
Look, Elena,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.384
I can't help you anymore.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.980
Is it because I told you
that I was thirsty?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.647
It's fine.
I can get more

15:49.649 --> 15:50.866
at the blood bank at the clinic.

15:50.867 --> 15:51.984
I work there.
It's easy.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.254
Elena, you're going
through this stuff like crazy.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.409
- Yeah.
- I'm not a drug pusher.

15:57.410 --> 15:59.158
No, you're my friend.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.160
My friend in spite of the fact

16:01.161 --> 16:03.495
that my boyfriend got
stuck on the other side.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.413
Elena, don't.

16:04.414 --> 16:05.797
Because you decided

16:05.798 --> 16:08.050
to stop the spell
that could bring him back.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.501
My friend that owes me.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.971
No. A friend who cares about you
and thinks you're living in denial.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.673
I know you have more.
Elena, stop.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.674
Where is it?

16:15.675 --> 16:16.675
Look at you.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.510
Where is it?

16:18.511 --> 16:22.797
I need to see Damon, Luke,
and I'm not asking.

16:29.361 --> 16:30.661
I kind of want to set up Ric
[music playing]

16:30.662 --> 16:31.913
with Jo from the hospital.

16:31.914 --> 16:33.698
I mean, we both know
he has a soft spot

16:33.699 --> 16:35.249
for the sexy doctor type.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.368
How long do you think it takes after
somebody comes back to life

16:37.369 --> 16:39.036
before they can start
dating again?

16:39.037 --> 16:41.421
Well, the fact that you can
say that with a straight face

16:41.422 --> 16:44.258
is one more reason that I love you.

16:44.259 --> 16:47.044
So, like, 3 months?

16:47.045 --> 16:49.881
Can I ask why there's not
a Bennett witch in the back?

16:49.882 --> 16:52.884
I mean, can't Luke
whip up a batch of herbs

16:52.885 --> 16:54.218
in Bonnie flavor?

16:54.219 --> 16:57.088
You know, if I had to drive around
with everyone that I've lost,

16:57.089 --> 16:59.086
I'd need a school bus.

17:00.058 --> 17:03.026
Or you just know that Bonnie
would agree with Luke.

17:03.028 --> 17:04.428
The last thing you need
to do is conjure up

17:04.429 --> 17:06.564
someone who's gonna
tell you the truth.

17:06.565 --> 17:08.031
Can we not talk about this?

17:08.032 --> 17:11.285
About what?
The fact that I'm dead?

17:11.286 --> 17:12.737
Because I am.

17:12.738 --> 17:14.570
Technically, you were
dead when we met.

17:14.573 --> 17:18.742
Good point.
Now I'm just gone.

17:18.743 --> 17:20.077
Damon, please don't say that.

17:20.078 --> 17:23.915
And this conversation is pretty much
the smart, level-headed you

17:23.915 --> 17:26.083
talking to the irrational
possible drug addict you.

17:26.084 --> 17:27.385
[Scoffs]

17:27.386 --> 17:29.670
Which is clear evidence
of your insanity.

17:29.671 --> 17:30.988
Yeah. Ok.

Still working out
the kinks of being human.

17:53.529 --> 17:54.778

17:54.780 --> 17:57.198
Yeah, Tyler, not
to play chaperone here,

17:57.199 --> 17:59.283
but are you sure somebody
with your anger issues

17:59.284 --> 18:02.453
should be drinking at all
this close to a full moon?

18:02.454 --> 18:04.455
My issues are under control.

18:04.456 --> 18:06.591
Coach lets me practice
with the football team.

18:06.592 --> 18:09.093
I get to kick ass in
a controlled environment.

18:09.094 --> 18:10.795
Till you get plastered
and do something stupid

18:10.796 --> 18:13.097
and trigger your werewolf
curse all over again.

18:13.098 --> 18:16.884
Alaric, chill.
It's under control.

18:16.885 --> 18:20.126
Good. But just in case.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.585
Really?

18:22.474 --> 18:25.142
You know, I haven't been buzzed
since I came back to life.

18:25.143 --> 18:28.551
And saying that aloud while sober
really freaks me out.

18:30.699 --> 18:31.781
Ahem.

18:37.873 --> 18:39.824
[Chuckles]

18:39.825 --> 18:41.709
As the only sober
person here, trust me

18:41.710 --> 18:42.827
when I tell you this, Tyler...

18:42.828 --> 18:46.880
That girl is so not into you.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.050
Thanks for the beer.

18:49.051 --> 18:51.001
[Women laughing]

18:54.673 --> 18:56.974
Your fridge makes me
want to kill myself.

18:56.975 --> 19:00.011
- We're gonna have to split this.
- Knock yourself out.

19:00.012 --> 19:03.180
So. You want to grab dinner?

19:03.181 --> 19:05.766
There's that crab shack on the harbor
you want to check out.

19:05.767 --> 19:08.185
Uh, yeah, I would,
but, um, I told Dean

19:08.186 --> 19:09.853
I'd stop by the garage later.

19:10.856 --> 19:13.824
Yeah, never heard
that one before.

19:13.825 --> 19:16.994
Hey, look, no offense, Ivy,
but, uh,

19:16.995 --> 19:18.996
you're the one who
showed up to me today.

19:18.997 --> 19:21.866
Hey, I'm not asking for
your hand in marriage.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.701
Stefan, come on.

19:23.702 --> 19:25.670
We've been hanging out
for two months now.

19:25.671 --> 19:28.422
I don't know anything
about you or your family.

19:28.423 --> 19:30.291
Your friends you never
talk about call you

19:30.292 --> 19:33.127
and you get all weird.
I get weird?

19:33.128 --> 19:35.128
Yeah. You get weird.

19:36.548 --> 19:37.932
So, we'll play a game.

19:37.933 --> 19:42.887
You tell me one thing about you
and I'll tell you one thing about me.

19:42.888 --> 19:46.524
Well, I already know
everything about you.

19:46.525 --> 19:50.111
You're from Colorado.
You love dogs.

19:50.112 --> 19:51.696
Your dad's
a bit of a pain in the ass,

19:51.697 --> 19:53.731
but you graciously
let him pay your rent.

19:53.732 --> 19:58.569
[Laughs] Ok. Fine.
Your turn.

19:58.570 --> 20:00.768
Now tell me something
I don't know about you.

20:04.076 --> 20:05.659
I'm a vampire.

20:08.497 --> 20:10.213
You're so annoying.

20:10.985 --> 20:12.248

Thank God.

20:46.284 --> 20:48.586
The rest of the chaperones are
huddled around the burger bar.

20:48.587 --> 20:50.121
And you're a vegetarian.

20:50.122 --> 20:52.528
I don't eat red meat.
I look at blood all day.

20:54.112 --> 20:56.093
Because I work at the medical center.

20:56.094 --> 20:59.347
Not because I'm a serial
killer or anything.

20:59.348 --> 21:00.464
I'm Jo.

21:00.465 --> 21:03.300
Alaric.
I teach occult studies here.

21:03.301 --> 21:06.103
I didn't know that was
an actual thing.

21:06.104 --> 21:08.355
- Yeah.
- Not that it's not a thing.

21:10.359 --> 21:11.541
May I?

21:12.380 --> 21:16.647
Uh, you know, actually, I'm
a germaphobe.

21:16.648 --> 21:18.449
A germaphobe.

21:18.450 --> 21:20.484
So, you're like
a vegetarian of cool people.

21:20.485 --> 21:23.620
Ha ha!
Yeah. Exactly.

21:23.622 --> 21:26.991
Um... will you excuse me
a second?

21:26.992 --> 21:30.043
I actually have to make a...
A quick phone call.

21:36.885 --> 21:41.222
Ok, so, when I lost my human nature,
I also lost my game.

Uhh.

21:48.230 --> 21:49.713
What are you looking for?

21:49.714 --> 21:53.066
I thought I had...
Guess not.

21:57.091 --> 21:58.772
Elena: What's this?

22:03.779 --> 22:06.363
Hey. Are you ok?

22:06.364 --> 22:09.366
Depends. Am I still
in the western hemisphere?

22:09.367 --> 22:11.334
Hang on.
I can help.

22:14.756 --> 22:16.373
I'm sorry.
I'm from New York

22:16.374 --> 22:18.342
and we're big on cell phone reception.

22:18.343 --> 22:20.277
[Chuckles] Where you heading?

22:20.278 --> 22:22.179
Mystic Falls.
My GPS died

22:22.180 --> 22:24.965
and then I started
second-guessing myself... aah!

22:24.966 --> 22:26.717
Aah!

22:26.718 --> 22:30.220
Easy. This is when you wipe her slate
and let her go.

22:31.223 --> 22:32.973
I am still hungry.

22:32.974 --> 22:35.059
Aah! Damon: You're gonna kill her,

22:35.060 --> 22:36.644
just like you nearly
killed the last one

22:36.645 --> 22:38.729
and the one before
that and the one before that.

22:38.730 --> 22:40.698
I got it, Damon.
I'm gonna let her go.

22:40.699 --> 22:42.866
I'm just... I just need a little more.

Oh, my God!

What are you...

22:50.041 --> 22:51.609
Caroline.
It's not...

Aah! Ow!
[Gasping]

23:05.807 --> 23:08.527
Help. Help, anybody.

23:08.528 --> 23:10.196
Caroline: What did you do?

23:10.197 --> 23:12.333
Why the hell are you
feeding on people?

23:12.334 --> 23:14.212
It's fine.
I've compelled everyone else.

23:14.213 --> 23:17.470
Whoa, hang on.
So, you're the border lurker?

23:17.471 --> 23:18.635
The what?

23:18.636 --> 23:21.757
Did you know my mom's been out looking
for a vampire prowler?

23:21.758 --> 23:24.972
[Sigh] It's gotta be the herbs
Luke's been giving me.

23:24.973 --> 23:26.929
They make me so thirsty.

23:26.930 --> 23:28.214
Maybe I'm not thinking straight.

23:28.215 --> 23:31.883
- Whoa. What herbs?
- They make me see Damon.

23:36.056 --> 23:39.392
I can talk to him and... and...
and I can be with him and...

23:39.393 --> 23:42.668
Is this what you've been
doing this whole time?

23:43.063 --> 23:45.715
Hallucinating your dead boyfriend?

23:45.716 --> 23:47.615
I tried to grieve him, Caroline.

23:49.214 --> 23:51.821
Trust me.
I know grief.

23:51.822 --> 23:54.240
I've got grieving down to
a science at this point,

23:54.241 --> 23:55.623
and I tried.

23:57.847 --> 23:59.244
But every time...

24:00.464 --> 24:02.248
I let it sink in that

24:02.249 --> 24:03.915
I'm never gonna see him again...

24:06.420 --> 24:08.231
I feel like I'm gonna die.

24:09.473 --> 24:12.758
Look, hon, I get it.
Ok? I do.

24:12.759 --> 24:17.263
But... there are
better ways to get through this.

24:17.264 --> 24:19.065
Like what?

24:19.066 --> 24:22.268
Like dropping out of school and
having picnics with my mom

24:22.269 --> 24:24.236
near the town border?

24:24.237 --> 24:25.771
Or maybe I could pull a Stefan

24:25.772 --> 24:27.440
and just bounce from
country to country

24:27.441 --> 24:29.275
chasing some false hope
that we're gonna find

24:29.276 --> 24:31.610
a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back.

24:31.611 --> 24:33.412
We're all getting through it.

24:33.413 --> 24:37.365
This is me getting through it. Ok?

24:37.367 --> 24:39.785
Yeah, but you're not
getting through it, Elena.

24:39.786 --> 24:41.503
You're just pressing pause.

24:44.007 --> 24:45.958
[Sigh] Look.
I'll call my mom

24:45.959 --> 24:47.293
and she can fix all this.

24:47.294 --> 24:49.962
But you need to get out of here
and go hide, ok?

24:49.963 --> 24:52.080
So, just... go.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.660

You have to help me.

25:35.342 --> 25:36.842
There was this girl.
I saw her.

25:36.843 --> 25:38.477
She looked so normal
but I swear to God,

25:38.478 --> 25:40.868
she had these teeth
and she bit me.

25:42.015 --> 25:43.842

- What the hell is going on here?

25:43.843 --> 25:45.194

You need to find her.

- There was this girl

25:47.687 --> 25:49.855
- and I was... I was lost...
- She had a dog.

25:49.856 --> 25:51.223
It bit her.
She was lost.

25:51.224 --> 25:52.475
She stopped to ask this
girl for directions.

25:52.476 --> 25:54.715
- She had a dog and it bit her.
- Is that what happened?

25:54.881 --> 25:56.162
Look at me.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.996
Matt. What's going on here?

25:57.998 --> 26:00.199
This girl was attacked.
I'm not sure we're getting the full story.

Matt, get her to the hospital now.

Hey-hey-hey-hey.

26:04.371 --> 26:06.372
What are you doing?
You need to talk to her.

26:06.373 --> 26:08.207
We'll get a statement as soon
as she's been treated.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.508
You didn't even ask her
what happened.

26:09.509 --> 26:12.511
All due respect, Tripp, you run
a volunteer community program.

26:12.512 --> 26:15.313

Elena, hey.

What's going on?

and tell me

that you're gonna find
Damon and bring him back.

27:20.830 --> 27:22.331
Not yet.

in the morning?

How do you go about your day
without falling apart?

27:31.508 --> 27:33.292
Tell me what you're
doing to get through this,

27:33.293 --> 27:35.343
because I'm clearly doing it wrong.

27:36.846 --> 27:40.015
There's no right
or wrong way, Elena.

27:40.016 --> 27:41.966
No, there's only forever.

27:44.354 --> 27:46.554
That's why I need you
to give me hope.

27:48.475 --> 27:51.399
Because I don't think I can
live forever without him.

27:52.312 --> 27:55.780
I can't.
I gave up.

27:57.567 --> 27:59.484
You just said that you
were looking for him.

28:00.370 --> 28:01.758
I did.

28:02.656 --> 28:04.657
And then I realized
it was pointless

28:04.658 --> 28:06.659
and that I needed to
move on with my life,

28:06.660 --> 28:09.862
so... I stopped.

28:09.863 --> 28:12.214
What do you mean you stopped?

28:12.215 --> 28:14.499
I mean I said good-bye, Elena.

28:15.719 --> 28:19.220
I moved on.
Damon is gone.

has some witchy drug problem?

28:54.608 --> 28:57.077
Yeah, Luke Parker has been
feeding her some concoction

28:57.078 --> 28:58.945
that allows her
to hallucinate Damon.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.448

It gets her all
bloodlusty and confused.

29:04.285 --> 29:08.004
- She nearly killed a girl today.
- This makes no sense.

29:08.005 --> 29:09.339
Yeah, well, neither did the fact that

29:09.340 --> 29:11.791
she got over Damon so
quickly when he died.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.461
Now it's crystal clear.
She hasn't.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.346
She's living in a fantasy land.

this happened to you,

that it won't happen again.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.018
Why the hell should I trust you?

Because I've been attacked like that
more times than I can count.

29:51.632 --> 29:52.999
I've had my throat ripped open.

I've died and come back to life.

to lose anyone else.

or are you just desperate for friends?

I could make anyone do
anything that I wanted.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.888
I was stronger than
most people on this earth.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.641
And then it went away.
And all that's left

35:59.642 --> 36:02.610
inside of me is rage.

36:02.611 --> 36:04.445
Why are you telling me this?

36:04.447 --> 36:07.231
Because I want you to understand that
I am trying to deal with it.

36:10.036 --> 36:12.653
Ok, good. Good luck dealing with it.

36:13.406 --> 36:14.906
Why do you do that?

36:14.907 --> 36:18.242
I'm trying to talk to you and you just
give me that look and walk away?

36:18.244 --> 36:20.377
What would you like me to do, Tyler?

36:26.635 --> 36:29.671

[Beep]

36:35.761 --> 36:38.595
Hey. It's me.

36:38.635 --> 36:43.600
Just leaving another message about
how today was not a good day.

36:48.908 --> 36:50.607
Caroline, voice-over:
Everyone drifted apart.

36:52.912 --> 36:58.448
Caroline, voice-over: It's like everyone's
pretending they can get through this alone.

37:04.123 --> 37:05.790
Caroline, voice-over:
Elena's gone

37:05.791 --> 37:08.460
and I think she's so scared
to accept what happened

37:08.461 --> 37:11.011
that she's become a completely
different person.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.810
Caroline, voice-over:
And if you ask me, Tyler's just

37:25.811 --> 37:28.146
hiding at Whitmore,
pretending everything's fine

37:28.147 --> 37:31.031
as if he can outrun his
werewolf gene or something.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.237
Caroline, voice-over: And Matt and
Jeremy never leave Mystic Falls anymore.

37:39.656 --> 37:43.628
Caroline, voice-over: There's an invisible
wall standing between us and them

37:43.629 --> 37:47.299
and nobody's doing anything about it.

37:49.168 --> 37:50.502
Caroline, voice-over:
Part of me wonders if they hope

37:50.503 --> 37:52.169
we never find a way back in.

38:00.729 --> 38:04.149
And then there's me,
just sitting in a diner

38:04.150 --> 38:06.334
on the border of town
looking for a way

38:06.335 --> 38:07.929
to get our home back.

38:08.476 --> 38:11.406
We just lost two of
our closest friends.

38:11.407 --> 38:15.326
We need each other.
We need to be together, Stefan,

38:15.327 --> 38:17.078
or pretty soon we're just gonna end up

38:17.079 --> 38:19.197
pictures in a yearbook
in a drawer somewhere,

38:19.198 --> 38:21.916
and so, that is why I am
not going to stop calling you

38:21.917 --> 38:24.586
until you pick up the phone
and I hear your voice

38:24.587 --> 38:28.088
and you tell me that you are
going to help me fix it.

38:29.288 --> 38:31.376
Because I am not
going to give up on us.

38:48.110 --> 38:49.726
Alaric: Why don't you get some sleep?

38:51.063 --> 38:54.232
We'll talk about it tomorrow
when that crap's out of your system.

38:54.233 --> 38:58.570
Because with all the funerals
and the start of the year...

38:58.571 --> 38:59.954
We never really talked
about how you're

38:59.955 --> 39:01.121
dealing with all this.

39:02.291 --> 39:05.243
You mean with me
coming back to life?

39:05.244 --> 39:08.796
Well, moving away
from Mystic Falls helped.

39:08.797 --> 39:10.415
And since my ex-girlfriend is

39:10.416 --> 39:14.586
happily married to
a pediatrician up in Alaska,

39:14.587 --> 39:18.089
I didn't have any awkward
reunions to handle.

39:18.090 --> 39:21.059
I meant the blood lust.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.760
The heightened emotions
and immortality.

39:33.606 --> 39:35.656
Honestly, Elena...

39:41.447 --> 39:44.616
I hate everything
about being a vampire.

39:44.617 --> 39:45.782
Me, too.

39:50.005 --> 39:52.373
At least I did.

39:52.374 --> 39:55.293
Then one day,
I discovered the good part.

39:55.294 --> 39:58.513
You know...
The promise

39:58.514 --> 40:00.982
that love could be eternal.

40:00.983 --> 40:02.599
And I had that with Damon.

40:04.270 --> 40:06.187
Which means for the rest of eternity,

40:06.188 --> 40:08.473
I'm gonna have a hole
in my heart where

40:08.474 --> 40:09.890
he's supposed to be.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.810
Trust me.
It gets easier.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.611
I know how death works, Ric.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.815
Trust me.
I have done it. A lot.

40:21.036 --> 40:23.371
There's no such thing
as moving on.

40:23.372 --> 40:24.655
It's a lie.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.661
So, if I'm ever going to be
able to fall in love again,

40:29.662 --> 40:31.329
and make eternity bearable,

40:31.330 --> 40:32.863
I need you to do something.

40:34.550 --> 40:35.666
What?

40:41.173 --> 40:44.509
You were created by
the original vampire spell,

40:44.510 --> 40:46.844
which means you can
compel other vampires.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.315
And since I can't
take away my vampirism,

40:50.316 --> 40:52.015
I want you to take away Damon.

40:56.905 --> 40:59.691
I want you to compel me
to forget that

40:59.692 --> 41:01.074
I ever loved him.
