Let's see
what this thing can do.

approved of the building,

for that matter, but...

child, if that's what you mean.

the worst thing in the world

a little bit of help?

live here forever, okay?

something, a machine, okay?

together.

and changing diapers

making plans?

hypothetical terms.

all about who we know,

we'll miss it.

to kill us slowly.

and eats and touches.

everything up right now,

make any decisions?

for our kids."

25:52.719 --> 25:56.122

finished it?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.135
Yeah, finally.
You made it hard enough.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.871
Yeah, I made it
for people like you.

26:13.740 --> 26:18.645
Unfortunately, there aren't many
people like you anymore.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.952

the way it ended.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.655
The pilgrim was a kid.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.325
Yeah,
the pilgrim was a kid.

remember what you said.

that I, you know...

in such a fog.

Oh, here.
Is this it?

27:29.816 --> 27:30.950
-No.
-Hey, hey, hey.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.152
You can't be doing that.
What...

27:33.185 --> 27:35.121
No.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.757
We just dropped these off
an hour ago.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.326
We, uh, put something
in here by mistake.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.696
Man: Well, once you drop it off,
it's our property.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.033
You know, I have no way of
verifying what's what or...

27:47.066 --> 27:50.069
-These are just T-shirts.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.971
Let's go.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.774
Okay. These clothes
belonged to a friend of mine,

27:54.807 --> 27:57.343
and he's no longer with us.

27:57.376 --> 28:01.380
There's exactly one item of
clothing that we're looking for.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.950
We dropped off nine bags.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.252
There's only eight here.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.822
That sweater's in the ninth bag,
and we just have to find it.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.761
Yeah, I mean, all this stuff
belonged to somebody, man.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.430

That's our bag
right there.

You can't know that.

Now look at these bags.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.973
Okay. They look like
trash bags, man.

I-I-I don't know
what to tell you.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.142
I'm sorry.
-That's our bag!

28:30.176 --> 28:31.811
It's just, this is
company policy, man.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.812
I don't know what to say.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.246
Let's go.

Are you going somewhere?

I'm moving.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.454
Got some friends
in Seattle.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.124
I'm gonna give that a try.
They say it's great.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.894
Yeah, yeah, I heard it's,
um...a whole scene.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.262
Yeah.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.231
I didn't know
you were going.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.101
I told Joe and everybody
a couple days ago.

Sort of a quick decision.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.206
I -- I'm sorry that I --

29:34.240 --> 29:38.310
I couldn't stick it out there,
for Joe's sake, but, um...

29:38.344 --> 29:41.113
There's just too much
of Gordon there at Comet,

29:41.147 --> 29:43.916

everywhere here.

done with all that, but...

will stick.

his decorating style.

in a past life or something?

32:53.672 --> 32:55.141

a decorator do it --

for Navajo blankets.

there is."

get out of your hair.

for a while, huh?

to get something to eat.

out of here for a little while.
