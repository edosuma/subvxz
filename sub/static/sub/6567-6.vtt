One day...

00:01.143 --> 00:03.292
you will sip from
the Fountain of Memory...

00:03.293 --> 00:05.328
When that day comes,
we will meet again.

00:05.395 --> 00:08.164
Time and again, you prove to be
no more than dead weight.

00:08.232 --> 00:09.665
Perhaps you should
mark me a traitor

00:09.733 --> 00:11.166
and have me killed
as well.

00:13.736 --> 00:15.804
People underestimate you,
Giuliano,

00:15.872 --> 00:18.172
yet that perceived
weakness makes you suited

00:18.240 --> 00:20.741
to flushing out
a spy from cover.

00:20.809 --> 00:24.078
You're the one that slipped
those documents into my quarters.

00:24.146 --> 00:27.014
How long have they owned you?
(Grunts)

00:27.082 --> 00:29.517
You are just as exasperating
as she was!

00:30.852 --> 00:33.020
- Is she dead?
- No difference, she's gone.

00:33.088 --> 00:35.823
That's why you can't stand
to look at me - she left you.

00:35.891 --> 00:40.193
- I saw a man.
- Who was it, Leonardo?

00:40.261 --> 00:42.329
Free me.

00:42.396 --> 00:44.964
- What did you see?
- It was me.

The Sons of Mithras have been
entwined with your destiny

02:16.480 --> 02:19.782
since long before
you were born, Leonardo.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.646
Time is a river,

02:22.713 --> 02:24.803
and there are members of our

02:24.871 --> 02:29.558
to navigate it - both upstream

You may think

02:41.668 --> 02:45.859
- That's not an answer.
- I never promised you answers.

02:45.927 --> 02:49.451
For those, you will need

Much as I enjoy
the entertainment, signor,

03:21.217 --> 03:23.879
we came to talk to the Duke
about hiring his mercenaries,

03:23.947 --> 03:26.906
not to watch them
beat each other senseless.

03:26.971 --> 03:28.602
Some mead,
fine sirs?

03:28.670 --> 03:30.931
Thank you.
Yes, indeed.

03:30.996 --> 03:32.927
We mull it with
a little honey.

03:32.992 --> 03:36.052
The pride of
the Duchy of Urbino.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.412
- A little honey?
- Just fucking drink it.

03:51.621 --> 03:55.644
Brilliant! Bravo!

03:55.712 --> 03:58.204
- Medici!
- Urbino!

03:58.271 --> 04:01.665
You know you fight like a man who's
not seen battle for far too long.

04:01.733 --> 04:03.728
- It's been too many years.
- Yes.

04:03.795 --> 04:06.287
Federico da Montefeltro,
Duke of Urbino.

04:06.355 --> 04:07.719
Leonardo Da Vinci.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.664
(Door opens)

04:18.432 --> 04:20.120

Reading? My!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.728
(Chuckles)

04:29.796 --> 04:34.087
This primer was given to me
by Gentile Becchi.

04:34.155 --> 04:36.611
You mourn him still.

04:41.300 --> 04:45.090
How may I serve you,
sister-in-law?

04:45.158 --> 04:49.216
We are due to hold a pageant for
Martedi Grasso, some days hence.

04:49.283 --> 04:50.745
I hoped you might
escort me.

04:50.812 --> 04:54.172
Even if Lorenzo returns
from his diplomatic forays,

04:54.240 --> 04:57.897
he usually finds pressing
business when the revels begin.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.327
At least he pays for
the revels.

05:00.392 --> 05:03.851
But what is a lady
to do for a partner?

05:03.919 --> 05:06.214
I can only thank heaven
Lorenzo has a brother

05:06.282 --> 05:08.440
who knows his way around
a dance floor.

05:08.507 --> 05:10.071
(Both laugh)

05:10.139 --> 05:14.694
Mm. You must forgive me,
but I have a plot to unravel.

05:14.761 --> 05:18.918
Becchi charged me with ferreting
out the spy within our midst.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.512
But the evidence against Becchi
was overwhelming.

05:21.579 --> 05:24.873
Testament to
the ability of our spy.

05:24.940 --> 05:29.396
He is a kind of genius.

05:29.463 --> 05:35.584
I will soldier on at the revels
without you, then.

05:35.652 --> 05:38.511
I'm touched at
your dedication.

05:38.579 --> 05:43.402
The fact that, for all
your opportunities...

05:43.469 --> 05:49.193
..you're so intent on doing
the right thing.

05:49.258 --> 05:54.050
Maybe your most
attractive quality.

05:54.118 --> 05:57.240
My lady, it is time.

05:57.308 --> 06:00.137
My personal torturer
has arrived.

06:00.204 --> 06:01.403
(Chuckles)

06:01.471 --> 06:03.833
- You know we have no choice.
- Mm.

06:03.901 --> 06:06.393
Twice a day,
I must down this potion

06:06.461 --> 06:10.885
if I'm to produce a boy,
after my earlier failures.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.178
Oh, Moses, tell Giuliano
what's in this.

06:13.246 --> 06:15.110
I cannot bring myself
to say the words.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.237
Asses' milk,
powdered goats' antlers,

06:17.305 --> 06:19.800
bull's testicles...

06:19.868 --> 06:22.442
Giuliano, you could spare me
this liquid atrocity

06:22.509 --> 06:24.147
if you would father
a son yourself.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.716
If we do not produce
a male heir soon,

06:26.783 --> 06:28.285
somewhere in our line,

06:28.353 --> 06:29.920
the house of Medici
will start

06:29.987 --> 06:31.588
to look like
an unstable investment.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.790
We each have our duty, I see.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.558
Salut.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.767
It's there.

06:46.835 --> 06:49.803
Logic dictates
that land lies due west.

06:49.871 --> 06:54.742
You think the identification of
a simple cardinal direction

06:54.809 --> 06:56.877
is all you need
to find your goal?

06:56.945 --> 06:58.713
It's all I need
to get started.

06:58.781 --> 07:01.482
You could spend a hundred
lifetimes traveling west,

07:01.550 --> 07:03.251
could you not?

07:04.787 --> 07:07.389
The map Avraham ben Yosef
brought to Florence

07:07.456 --> 07:09.891
is not an original,
but a reproduction,

07:09.959 --> 07:13.362
riddled with notations that
only one man can decipher.

07:13.430 --> 07:16.131
The cartographer
who copied it.

07:16.199 --> 07:19.602
- Another Son of Mithras?
- His name is Solomon Ogbai.

07:19.669 --> 07:21.404
We call him
the Abyssinian.

07:22.707 --> 07:26.643
Lucky for you,
he is not dead.

07:26.711 --> 07:29.513
Not yet.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.283
You have yet to save him.

07:33.351 --> 07:35.986
His retinue was
brutally intercepted

07:36.054 --> 07:39.323
while he was traveling under the
employ of the Ottoman Sultan.

07:40.759 --> 07:45.831
A most savage warlord
holds him captive.

07:45.898 --> 07:51.236
The Abyssinian cannot be freed by
simple diplomacy, or even ransom.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.774
It will take guile and inventiveness
- which only you possess.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.813
These are delicate times.
I have commitments to Florence.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.884
Your destiny lies elsewhere,
Leonardo.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.353
Save the Abyssinian
while he still breathes.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.360
I have to think it over,
I can't...

08:14.428 --> 08:17.500
You've already
thought it over.

08:17.568 --> 08:22.410
In truth, your journey
has already begun.

08:23.879 --> 08:28.284
Time...is a river.

08:39.302 --> 08:41.870
You have already made
the decision.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.509
You make it every time.

09:06.231 --> 09:07.698
He's done the coin thing,
has he?

09:12.337 --> 09:15.105
You're the map maker.

09:15.173 --> 09:17.941
I thought
you needed rescuing?

09:18.009 --> 09:22.412
- I will.
- In the future?

09:22.480 --> 09:25.215
The sooner you move beyond words
like present and future,

09:25.283 --> 09:28.885
the sooner you become
the man we need you to be.

09:28.953 --> 09:31.555
Are all the Sons of Mithras
unable to speak plainly?

09:31.623 --> 09:33.123
(Chuckles)

09:33.191 --> 09:37.961
I admit, on occasion, we can be
inscrutable, but so can you.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.031
I wanted to meet
the storied Da Vinci

09:42.099 --> 09:44.801
in the bright of day.

09:44.869 --> 09:48.605
We're different men,
once Hell breaks loose.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.240
And when's that happen?

09:51.308 --> 09:52.775
Hell happens when

09:52.843 --> 09:54.844
the evil of this world
exceeds our belief

09:54.911 --> 09:56.379
that we can conquer it.

09:57.714 --> 09:59.682
You ask me when
you'll reach that point.

09:59.749 --> 10:01.383
I cannot say.

10:01.451 --> 10:03.352
Depends on you.

10:04.755 --> 10:08.524
Whatever befalls us,
do not shirk from the task.

10:08.592 --> 10:10.926
I have a knack of rising
to the occasion,

10:10.994 --> 10:14.897
if I might only be told
what the occasion is...

10:14.965 --> 10:16.465
I venture to say it's true

10:16.533 --> 10:18.868
what the Sons of Mithras
have seen you in you,

10:18.935 --> 10:21.604
and you are closer
every day, artista.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.242
- Closer to what?
- Wake up.

10:33.218 --> 10:36.053
Where are you leading me?

10:36.121 --> 10:38.856
L-leading you? Maestro,
you're the one leading us.

10:38.924 --> 10:40.324
What?

10:40.392 --> 10:43.394
You woke us in the night, gave
us one of your shopping lists.

10:43.461 --> 10:45.296
Buy more magnesium,

10:45.363 --> 10:47.531
obtain obscure alcoholic
beverages from the East,

10:47.599 --> 10:49.299
acquire three horses...

10:49.367 --> 10:51.835
You had some plan.
Do you not remember?

10:51.902 --> 10:55.371
I do, I do. I remember it.

10:55.439 --> 10:56.973
- How long have we...
- Days.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.108
You've been a sullen fuck
the entire trip,

10:59.176 --> 11:01.811
all for some foreign halfwit
who got himself abducted.

11:01.879 --> 11:04.847
- The Abyssinian.
- It's like...

11:04.915 --> 11:07.350
It's like
I'm just waking up.

11:09.553 --> 11:11.387
I lost part of myself
on the journey.

11:11.454 --> 11:15.324
- Journey where?
- It's not where...

11:15.392 --> 11:16.992
..it's when.

11:26.636 --> 11:29.171
The evils of this world.

11:29.239 --> 11:31.340
There's something odd
around the castle.

11:33.976 --> 11:41.115
- What's this?
- You'll see what it does.

11:41.183 --> 11:44.285
(Gasps)
Whose kingdom is this?

11:44.353 --> 11:46.554
The locals call him Tepes.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.756
That's the man
we've come to confront?

11:48.824 --> 11:51.159
The one who has your captive
is the fucking Impaler?

11:58.501 --> 11:59.601
(Hissing)

11:59.669 --> 12:01.536
I lost my right eye in battle.

12:01.604 --> 12:05.140
<i>Removed the bridge of my nose,</i>
<i>so I'd still have peripheral vision.</i>

12:07.043 --> 12:08.443
There.

12:08.511 --> 12:10.312
Clever, eh?

12:10.380 --> 12:14.149
- (Chuckles)
- That is quite...gleaming.

12:14.217 --> 12:17.019
And so we should explain
our reason for being here.

12:17.087 --> 12:18.821
- Piero?
- May I?

12:20.224 --> 12:24.461
The two Papal states flank
your land and mine

12:24.528 --> 12:27.898
and while we can watch
Rome with one eye...

12:27.965 --> 12:32.169
..we must always keep
another...eye,

12:32.237 --> 12:35.974
always on the Pope's property,
to the north.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.108
Unless...

12:38.243 --> 12:43.214
..the northern realm
became our property.

12:43.282 --> 12:44.915
And how would that happen?

12:44.983 --> 12:48.853
Well,
if we allied ourselves -

12:48.920 --> 12:52.123
Florence and Urbino -

12:52.190 --> 12:57.228
it'd make sense if we could carve up the
northern Papal territory between us.

12:57.296 --> 12:59.731
I can annexe the city of Bologna
and its environs.

12:59.799 --> 13:02.901
You could double your port
capacity on the Adriatic.

13:02.969 --> 13:06.204
A bold stroke, but why don't I
conquer it myself?

13:06.272 --> 13:09.675
I have the army.
What do you offer up?

13:09.742 --> 13:12.578
(Laughs) Money, of course,

13:12.646 --> 13:16.049
from the largest banking concern
in all of Europe.

13:16.116 --> 13:19.085
From each of us,
as he is...

13:19.153 --> 13:20.720
..blessed.

13:24.691 --> 13:27.693
Scared you,
didn't I? (Laughs)

13:27.761 --> 13:30.263
That'll be fine, Medici.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.298
I shouldn't provoke
my own godson,

13:32.366 --> 13:34.434
but I like to test
a man.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.803
You've grown to be
a worthy ally.

13:36.871 --> 13:39.439
And it's been too long since
I led my men into combat.

13:39.507 --> 13:41.074
Our proposal is timely, indeed.

13:41.142 --> 13:43.143
I knew you had something
juicy in mind,

13:43.210 --> 13:44.811
when you showed up on
my doorstep.

13:44.879 --> 13:47.881
There's no way you'd caravan
all this distance

13:47.948 --> 13:51.451
just to watch me take a shit.
(Guffaws)

13:51.519 --> 13:53.420
(Laughs)

13:55.556 --> 13:58.525
(NICO) Their turbans are nailed
to their skulls.

13:58.593 --> 14:02.596
(ZOROASTER) All Turkish. Clearly this
warlord has an issue with the Ottomans.

14:02.664 --> 14:06.967
(DA VINCI) His bravery against the
Turks won him 13 years in prison.

14:07.035 --> 14:10.971
But, seeing as none of us
are Turks ourselves,

14:11.039 --> 14:14.375
we should have
nothing to fear.

14:14.443 --> 14:16.411
You don't think,
with my blood,

14:16.478 --> 14:17.779
someone could take me
for a Turk?

14:17.846 --> 14:20.081
How do I know this warlord's
eyes aren't failing?

14:20.149 --> 14:24.519
Because I spotted you
from miles away.

14:24.586 --> 14:27.221
Though I were blind,
I could hear the clattering

14:27.289 --> 14:30.157
and nattering of your Tartar
tongue from further yet.

14:30.225 --> 14:33.828
- I'm not a Tartar.
- What are you, then?

14:33.896 --> 14:35.463
- Unique.
- Unique?

14:35.531 --> 14:38.399
Dung beetles think
they're unique.

14:38.467 --> 14:42.403
Your mongrel half-breed lineage
speaks louder than your words.

14:42.471 --> 14:48.143
You see God, well, has many
punishments for mankind:

14:48.211 --> 14:51.847
earthquakes, volcanoes,
plagues and cancers.

14:51.915 --> 14:55.084
Worse than these, he sent
the Turks and the Tartars

14:55.151 --> 14:56.819
and the mongrels,
like you.

15:01.257 --> 15:02.858
(Whinnies)

15:09.733 --> 15:11.534
Ave,
Vladislaus Dracul Filius,

15:11.602 --> 15:15.005
vaivoda partium
Transalpinarum.

15:15.073 --> 15:17.174
Prince of Transylvania
and Wallachia,

15:17.242 --> 15:19.910
son of Vlad II known as Vlad
Dracul, or Vlad the Dragon,

15:19.978 --> 15:23.080
which makes you Vlad III,
Son of the Dragon.

15:23.148 --> 15:27.718
Or as it is known in
your language: Dracula.

15:27.786 --> 15:31.155
Impressive,
your command of my titles,

15:31.223 --> 15:34.326
but tell me who you are
and what you want here.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.327
My name is Maestro Leonardo.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.864
These are my companions,
Nico, Zoroaster.

15:39.932 --> 15:42.700
We were sent by the
Magnificent Lorenzo de Medici

15:42.768 --> 15:44.836
of the Republic of Florence.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.406
All of Italy wonders at your
victories against the Ottomans,

15:48.473 --> 15:50.274
and my lord extends
his friendship

15:50.342 --> 15:52.977
and seeks military counsel
for the greater glory

15:53.044 --> 15:54.779
of Florence
and Wallachia.

15:56.815 --> 16:00.283
You must know this land
has been bedeviled by war,

16:00.351 --> 16:02.318
and worse than war.

16:04.889 --> 16:07.657
We shall talk more...

16:08.726 --> 16:10.960
..at dinner.

16:11.028 --> 16:13.229
As long as
the dinner's not us.

16:13.297 --> 16:15.365
(Bell tolls)

16:16.901 --> 16:19.736
So we're selling tickets to
the Papal baths now, are we?

16:21.906 --> 16:23.840
An urgent matter has arisen.

16:23.907 --> 16:28.145
Urgent enough that you sully
this chamber with her presence?

16:28.212 --> 16:30.747
I know where to find
whores if I want them.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.983
We thought it best you hear this
news directly from her lips.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.423
I've come from Florence,
Your Holiness.

16:40.490 --> 16:44.361
And does your absence
from the city...

16:44.428 --> 16:46.063
..create no suspicion?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.798
My aunt in Siena is
providing me with an alibi.

16:48.866 --> 16:51.801
No-one of import will
miss me in Florence.

16:51.869 --> 16:55.204
Certainly your husband doesn't
fall into the category of import.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.175
What of
Lorenzo's war engineer,

16:59.243 --> 17:02.846
in whom the Count seems
so fascinated?

17:02.913 --> 17:04.815
Da Vinci has set out
from the city.

17:04.882 --> 17:07.951
No man knows where.

17:08.019 --> 17:09.487
Nor woman?

17:09.555 --> 17:11.556
Nor I.

17:13.392 --> 17:16.560
Lorenzo himself
has left Florence.

17:16.628 --> 17:18.262
As we speak,

17:18.330 --> 17:20.632
he makes an embassy to
the Duke of Urbino,

17:20.700 --> 17:22.635
fresh with the credit
of his dealings

17:22.702 --> 17:25.270
with Ferdinand and Isabella.

17:25.338 --> 17:28.974
He seeks to create
a new military alliance.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.710
The calculating rogue.

17:31.778 --> 17:35.147
<i>Far from reeling at our attempts</i>
<i>to weaken his rule,</i>

17:35.214 --> 17:38.049
Lorenzo courts the most
accomplished mercenaries

17:38.117 --> 17:39.150
on the peninsula.

17:39.218 --> 17:41.753
I know what
the naval do with them.

17:41.821 --> 17:44.122
He and Urbino
will march north.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.793
Together, they'll sack our lands
surrounding Bologna

17:47.860 --> 17:49.561
and divide them up.

17:49.629 --> 17:51.062
How do you know, Holy Father?

17:51.130 --> 17:54.533
Because it's exactly what
I'd do, you fucking coward.

17:55.569 --> 17:57.370
Look at the lot of you.

17:57.437 --> 18:00.039
Too scared to bring me
this news yourselves.

18:00.107 --> 18:04.643
Hiding behind
this Florentine slit.

18:04.711 --> 18:08.247
How can I wonder Lorenzo
resists me so well,

18:08.315 --> 18:10.783
when I see
the quality of my allies?

18:12.553 --> 18:15.722
We only tried
to serve your glory.

18:15.789 --> 18:19.492
We had not the benefit
of your divine guidance.

18:19.559 --> 18:21.694
Guidance? You want guidance?

18:23.564 --> 18:26.533
Do you remember what proved
I was chosen by God?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.502
So... So many things,
Your Holiness.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.476
The way I survived
drowning as a child.

18:36.544 --> 18:38.111
Let's see how you do.

18:49.590 --> 18:54.861
Holy Father, surely...
a loving God shows mercy.

18:54.929 --> 18:56.430
You dare question me?

18:56.497 --> 19:00.234
The rock upon which
God's word stands.

19:00.302 --> 19:01.969
Kiss this ring.

19:16.484 --> 19:18.351
My bath is ruined.

19:19.786 --> 19:23.789
I don't care how,
end the house of Medici,

19:23.857 --> 19:25.324
before I end you.

19:35.502 --> 19:37.436
(VLAD) Dinner awaits.

19:40.374 --> 19:43.242
How are we supposed to free the
captive from a place like this?

19:43.310 --> 19:45.077
If I knew that,
I'd be Da Vinci.

19:48.515 --> 19:50.516
You've dropped some change.

19:50.584 --> 19:53.686
Of course, you'll have
noticed the money.

19:53.754 --> 19:58.392
The Sultanis -
a base currency...

19:58.460 --> 20:00.894
..for the heathen ruler
of the east.

20:00.962 --> 20:03.897
You see, this is how
I allow my soldiers

20:03.965 --> 20:06.100
to prove
their loyalty to me.

20:06.168 --> 20:10.004
I toss these Sultanis on
the ground before them.

20:10.071 --> 20:13.641
And, do you know, the coins are
never, ever touched?

20:14.943 --> 20:16.543
It's just they've fallen
quite randomly,

20:16.611 --> 20:18.245
you'd really notice
if one was gone?

20:23.385 --> 20:26.186
I miss nothing.

20:29.191 --> 20:31.225
Please, now.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.962
A little Tuscan wine,

20:34.030 --> 20:35.831
just to make you feel
at home, no?

20:35.899 --> 20:37.066
(Laughs)

20:37.133 --> 20:39.335
Thank you. Thank you.

20:39.402 --> 20:42.070
I must say, I'm impressed with
your hospitality,

20:42.138 --> 20:45.674
so soon after your escape
from captivity.

20:45.742 --> 20:47.609
I am, sadly, at home
in dungeons.

20:47.677 --> 20:51.113
As a child, my father sent
my brother and me

20:51.181 --> 20:55.951
to be hostages held by
the Turkish Sultan.

20:56.019 --> 20:59.722
The prisons converted
my damnable brother

20:59.789 --> 21:03.592
to the cause of the Turks,
but not me.

21:03.659 --> 21:05.126
I learned to trust nobody.

21:05.194 --> 21:07.361
To survive any pain,
the dogs, the dungeons,

21:07.429 --> 21:08.996
even a lightning strike,

21:09.064 --> 21:13.333
which has left me with
this...web of scars.

21:16.070 --> 21:23.709
Now I spend every waking hour
in resistance to my brother...

21:23.777 --> 21:29.248
..and the fucking Turks.

21:33.086 --> 21:36.623
Well your victories against them
have been recognized,

21:36.690 --> 21:38.691
even by the Pope.

21:41.028 --> 21:42.762
If we're going to raise
a toast,

21:42.830 --> 21:46.032
let's lift a glass to the one who
helped me out of the prison this time,

21:46.100 --> 21:47.867
to the Bringer
of Light himself.

21:47.935 --> 21:50.703
Who, my lord?

21:50.771 --> 21:55.441
Lucifer,
the Bringer of Light.

21:55.508 --> 21:57.576
Most beautiful
of all the angels.

21:59.812 --> 22:01.513
And how did Lucifer
help you?

22:01.580 --> 22:05.884
Like me, Lucifer rose
against a tyrant.

22:05.952 --> 22:11.323
Like me, he was abandoned and
betrayed by the God he loved.

22:11.390 --> 22:14.759
I made a pact with Lucifer
to win my freedom

22:14.827 --> 22:19.498
and ascend to my throne
one last time.

22:19.566 --> 22:23.435
And, do you know...?

22:23.502 --> 22:27.673
I don't find it hard
to live without a soul.

22:33.045 --> 22:35.146
Lucifer.

22:39.518 --> 22:41.086
And how fortuitous for
Da Vinci.

22:41.154 --> 22:45.491
The clever devil leaves just as
I arrive with questions.

22:45.559 --> 22:47.193
You don't find
that curious?

22:47.260 --> 22:51.464
Trust me, signor, that's the
least curious thing about him.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.800
What is your relationship
with him?

22:54.868 --> 22:57.536
We had our day...

22:57.604 --> 23:00.940
..but that's all it was,
a day.

23:01.008 --> 23:03.944
And, anyway,
his eye is set on another.

23:04.011 --> 23:07.781
- How do you know?
- I'm a woman.

23:07.849 --> 23:10.351
No, of course
we're friends.

23:10.418 --> 23:15.522
He saved my life and, for that,
I deeply admire him.

23:15.590 --> 23:17.425
That hasn't become illegal,
has it?

23:17.492 --> 23:19.060
It has if it hurts Florence.

23:19.127 --> 23:20.895
All I want is
your help in guarding her.

23:20.963 --> 23:23.731
I don't know where he's gone.

23:23.799 --> 23:25.566
You keep
his confidences well.

23:25.634 --> 23:29.003
I'd like to lie
to anyone else, Excellency,

23:29.070 --> 23:31.571
but not you.

23:34.042 --> 23:38.279
Although, if you tried
to force it out of me,

23:38.347 --> 23:41.182
I'd be helpless
to stop you.

23:42.584 --> 23:45.987
Perhaps we should discuss
this somewhere else.

23:46.054 --> 23:48.690
- Somewhere more quiet?
- Mm.

23:48.757 --> 23:50.725
Until we make it less so.

23:56.598 --> 23:59.467
- (Door opens)
- The city gates are closed.

23:59.535 --> 24:03.571
Two minutes to curfew,
scoundrel.

24:03.639 --> 24:06.140
Either you get your arses home
or spend the night here.

24:06.208 --> 24:09.810
Persons caught roaming the streets after
curfew get put in my little book.

24:09.878 --> 24:14.082
Being put in my little book means you
explain your transgressions to the judge.

24:14.149 --> 24:16.484
Signor Medici,
forgive me.

24:16.552 --> 24:18.352
I hadn't seen you with
a bar wench.

24:18.420 --> 24:21.389
- Your little book?
- My ledger, full of pigs, mostly.

24:21.457 --> 24:23.424
You record every curfew
violation?

24:23.492 --> 24:24.992
Since the day
it was declared.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.495
If one were to study these,
one might see who was out,

24:27.563 --> 24:28.997
when they shouldn't
have been?

24:29.064 --> 24:31.565
Yes, if one were
a glutton for punishment.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.301
Take me to them.

24:33.369 --> 24:35.737
One could speak weeks paging
through these records.

24:35.804 --> 24:39.741
Then we're in luck. According to my
brother, I'm great at wasting time.

24:47.316 --> 24:49.584
Your secret, sir?

24:49.652 --> 24:52.888
Oh, it's a matter of knowing
which elements to blend.

24:52.955 --> 24:56.091
Magnesium here,
iron filings there, so on.

24:56.159 --> 24:57.559
I think it's ingenious.

24:57.627 --> 25:00.796
Does it have
a military application?

25:00.864 --> 25:02.865
Not yet.

25:02.933 --> 25:04.600
Well, then,
we must talk further.

25:04.668 --> 25:07.036
Since I've renounced
your Christian gods,

25:07.104 --> 25:09.706
I've only my wits and
ferocity to protect me

25:09.774 --> 25:12.609
from the forces
of Sultan Mehmed II.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.713
Perhaps the ingenuity you bring
to Lorenzo's court

25:16.781 --> 25:18.515
could benefit me as well.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.486
Now...

25:24.022 --> 25:26.924
..since you've shown me
your little party piece,

25:26.992 --> 25:31.795
I will respond in kind with
a little diversion of my own.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.398
You see, without a
soul weighing me down,

25:35.466 --> 25:37.767
I can see in the dark.

25:37.835 --> 25:40.971
I cannot be killed.

25:41.038 --> 25:44.240
I can enjoy certain
entertainments

25:44.308 --> 25:47.110
that may have made me
blanch years ago.

25:49.914 --> 25:54.318
This is the last of the retinue
of a Turkish ambassador

25:54.385 --> 25:57.854
who was foolish enough to
approach me.

25:59.991 --> 26:03.561
I miss no opportunity in
reminding the Turks

26:03.629 --> 26:05.963
of the childhood
they provided.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.332
Is it the one
we're looking for?

26:08.400 --> 26:11.936
Unshackle him.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.143
(Snarling)

26:23.882 --> 26:27.918
Now...prove stronger
than your friends.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.655
Defeat these dogs
and you will go free.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.791
(Barking)

26:32.858 --> 26:34.759
And please don't think
me so inhuman

26:34.827 --> 26:36.761
that I wouldn't give you
a fighting chance.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.097
Here's a butter knife.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.213
(Shrieks)

26:57.816 --> 26:59.583
Please! Don't!

26:59.651 --> 27:01.752
(Screams)

27:03.221 --> 27:05.523
- This...
- (Gurgles)

27:07.225 --> 27:08.726
This is justice.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.832
So...shall we send
for the main course?

27:14.900 --> 27:17.969
- I can't eat.
- (Vomits)

27:18.036 --> 27:20.738
My tastes are not universally
shared, it's true.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.808
- Let us retire.
- Before we do...

27:27.513 --> 27:33.084
You have honored us with the
traditional wine of our homeland,

27:33.152 --> 27:38.556
and so do we honor you, with the
traditional liquor of Wallachia.

27:38.624 --> 27:42.460
- You've brought Tuica?
- Mm-hm.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.529
Well, our master in Florence
would spare no expense

27:45.597 --> 27:48.967
to demonstrate his admiration
for you, my lord.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.641
To Vlad III.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.987
When have I ever known you to
hesitate about a drink, my friend?

28:12.091 --> 28:13.725
To Vlad III.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.497
To Vlad III.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.102
Good.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.837
And some for your maid?
Your men?

28:25.905 --> 28:27.939
- Yes.
- Yes? Good.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.375
There you go.

28:32.345 --> 28:35.680
Some for you...
Some for you.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.850
Show the friends to a room.

28:38.918 --> 28:42.287
- Some for you.
- Once my guards have toasted our guests,

28:42.355 --> 28:44.389
the artisan and I
will parley further.

28:44.457 --> 28:50.529
How about your dogs, who entertained
us so well, this evening?

28:50.597 --> 28:54.733
There's some for you, for you,
the last little drop.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.236
(Howling)

28:59.038 --> 29:01.006
(Squeaking)

29:01.074 --> 29:03.375
Please don't be unsettled
by the vermin.

29:03.443 --> 29:06.212
I welcome them.

29:06.279 --> 29:09.014
Often, in prison,
they were my only friends.

29:09.082 --> 29:13.453
Well, I know what it is
to be thrown into a cell.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.889
Without the companionship
of the bats,

29:15.956 --> 29:18.925
I would not
have survived.

29:18.993 --> 29:21.961
You see.

29:22.029 --> 29:27.700
- We understand each other.
- Hmm.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.402
Come.

29:31.572 --> 29:34.073
(Distant howling)

29:35.909 --> 29:38.378
Beautiful, is it not?

29:42.316 --> 29:47.720
You see, this is why I wanted to
return to Castle Poenari so badly.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.422
From the heights...

29:51.725 --> 29:55.962
..I can almost forget
the decades the Turks

29:56.030 --> 29:57.930
have been living
underneath the earth.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.200
It's a shame, then,
that was the last of them.

30:02.268 --> 30:06.238
Oh, there is one more.

30:06.306 --> 30:12.711
Their master, Solomon Ogbai.

30:12.779 --> 30:14.580
The name Ogbai,

30:14.647 --> 30:18.383
in Amharic, it means:
don't take him away.

30:18.451 --> 30:21.085
Yeah?

30:22.955 --> 30:25.289
Indeed.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.626
For stooping to serve them,

30:28.694 --> 30:33.363
I take my time with
the Abyssinian.

30:33.431 --> 30:38.669
I keep him ready for
my personal whims.

30:38.737 --> 30:42.072
I invent new ways to torture,
just for him.

30:42.140 --> 30:45.342
There is a window,
near where I keep him.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.544
He cannot see the view.

30:47.612 --> 30:52.683
So I said I would recreate
the scenery for him...

30:52.751 --> 30:57.288
..if he would only
provide me with

30:57.356 --> 31:01.393
the raw material
for a suitable miniature.

31:03.629 --> 31:10.301
These are the crenulations of
the towers outside my window...

31:10.369 --> 31:14.205
..carved in
the Abyssinian's own flesh.

31:17.543 --> 31:22.180
There is one frontier he shall
never stop exploring.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.415
Agony.

31:27.185 --> 31:31.388
May I share a confession
with you?

31:31.455 --> 31:34.824
Yeah, yes...

31:34.892 --> 31:37.594
..if it pleases, my lord.

31:37.661 --> 31:40.329
I know...

31:40.397 --> 31:42.865
..that I'm mad.

31:42.933 --> 31:46.269
Indeed? (Clears throat)

31:46.337 --> 31:50.273
But will you tell me how
I could be otherwise?

31:50.341 --> 31:53.143
A father rips a child
from his home,

31:53.210 --> 31:54.744
from everything he knows

31:54.812 --> 31:57.748
and tosses him into the claws
of his worst enemy.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.885
Well, we are...

32:01.953 --> 32:06.022
We are too often
what our fathers make us.

32:06.089 --> 32:08.724
Whether we like it or not,
better or for worse.

32:08.791 --> 32:11.626
Oh, yes.

32:11.694 --> 32:15.030
In my case,
definitely for worse.

32:15.098 --> 32:19.000
You see, my father,
he taught me

32:19.068 --> 32:22.770
that cruelty is the only true
currency of the universe,

32:22.838 --> 32:26.740
and now I am the richest man
in all of Christendom.

32:26.808 --> 32:28.643
Ha!

33:14.955 --> 33:17.323
(Mutters)

33:25.800 --> 33:28.435
- My God, it is true.
- Yes?

33:28.502 --> 33:31.872
Servants told me you were carrying
books upon books into your quarters.

33:31.939 --> 33:34.708
I wondered if they'd been
raiding the wine cellar.

33:34.776 --> 33:37.010
- I'm easy to tease.
- Only sometimes.

33:37.078 --> 33:39.246
Well, at least you have
a hobby you love.

33:39.313 --> 33:41.715
And what is your new hobby?

33:41.782 --> 33:44.651
The Florentine obsession with
record keeping is paying off.

33:44.719 --> 33:47.621
These are the records to every guard
at every station in the city.

33:47.688 --> 33:50.924
Anyone who breaks curfew
will be put down here.

33:50.992 --> 33:53.093
Including, I suppose,
the true spy,

33:53.161 --> 33:54.795
whom you believe
framed Becchi.

33:54.863 --> 33:57.465
You smirk, but there are
mysteries to be solved here.

33:57.533 --> 34:01.002
For example, why do these symbols
from the zodiac keep coming up?

34:01.070 --> 34:03.405
This. That's the sign for
Capricorn, I think.

34:03.472 --> 34:05.073
And this, that's Aquarius, yes?

34:05.141 --> 34:07.609
With certain sensitive
subjects of Florence,

34:07.677 --> 34:09.478
their names are indicated
with symbols,

34:09.545 --> 34:12.380
rather than list them clearly as
violators of the curfew.

34:12.447 --> 34:15.250
Ah. This date I recall.

34:15.318 --> 34:18.821
After a long night of carousing,
I was questioned on my way home,

34:18.888 --> 34:20.989
so is this the symbol for me?

34:21.058 --> 34:22.725
Athletic champion
that you are,

34:22.793 --> 34:25.194
Sagittarius is
a natural code name for you.

34:25.261 --> 34:27.563
Tell us the identity behind each
of these symbols, then.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.197
I'm not privy to
that knowledge.

34:29.264 --> 34:32.434
- That's in Captain Dragonetti's office.
- Obtain it for me.

34:36.038 --> 34:38.239
Becchi would be proud of you.

34:44.045 --> 34:46.614
(Distant howling)

34:48.183 --> 34:51.985
The man we're here to save must
be dead by now.

34:52.053 --> 34:55.389
No. No, not yet.

34:56.824 --> 35:01.161
But...but we must move
to save him now.

35:02.497 --> 35:04.031
You two can go on.

35:04.098 --> 35:07.659
I feel like I could sleep
for the next week.

35:07.684 --> 35:08.735
As could I.

35:08.736 --> 35:12.272
That's because
we've all been poisoned.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.041
What?

35:17.712 --> 35:19.346
Drink some antidote.

35:19.414 --> 35:21.782
That bastard.

35:21.850 --> 35:27.255
- He slipped something in our drinks.
- No.

35:27.323 --> 35:29.725
I did.

35:32.762 --> 35:36.566
There's nothing you won't do to
us in your bloody quest.

35:39.570 --> 35:44.407
I... I adulterated the Tuica
before we arrived.

35:47.678 --> 35:53.583
That we'd all have to drink it, in
order to convince him it was safe.

35:58.055 --> 35:59.690
(Sighs)

35:59.757 --> 36:02.760
And now...

36:02.827 --> 36:08.132
..everyone, including the dogs,
should be passing out.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.240
Ready?

36:23.183 --> 36:25.084
How do you know where
we're going?

36:25.152 --> 36:27.486
It's a simple
architectural assessment.

36:29.890 --> 36:34.394
The Abyssinian pointed it
out to me himself, in a way.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.563
Do we wanna know
what you mean?

36:37.631 --> 36:41.200
No, actually, you don't.

36:42.603 --> 36:45.505
It's here.

36:45.573 --> 36:49.342
Are you sure about this,
Maestro?

36:49.410 --> 36:50.944
No.

37:16.338 --> 37:18.639
(Soft breathing)

37:39.961 --> 37:41.361
What does that say?

37:45.933 --> 37:47.500
Don't take me away.

37:50.938 --> 37:54.607
Now, this, this is justice.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.977
To Vlad III.

37:58.045 --> 38:00.546
(Grunts)

38:00.614 --> 38:03.783
Farewell greetings from
a half-breed mongrel.

38:12.727 --> 38:15.295
Nico...

38:15.363 --> 38:18.331
..go get the horses.
I'll meet you outside.

38:36.118 --> 38:38.953
(Mutters)

38:39.021 --> 38:41.122
Ah. That one.

39:08.116 --> 39:10.116
(Grunts)

39:26.467 --> 39:28.001
Careful. Careful. Careful.

39:40.248 --> 39:41.982
It's that one, then that one.

39:49.924 --> 39:51.958
Not too fast,
he'll be cut even deeper.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.997
It's all over. It's OK.
It's over.

39:58.065 --> 40:00.800
It's not. It's not.

40:02.503 --> 40:04.704
It's not him.

40:13.413 --> 40:15.047
It's not Vlad.

40:15.115 --> 40:16.482
Shit.

40:22.856 --> 40:24.557
Fuck me.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.933
(Groans)

40:36.771 --> 40:38.104
(Grunts)

40:42.242 --> 40:43.348
(Chokes)

40:43.373 --> 40:45.344
You're an arrogant
little fool, aren't you?

40:45.345 --> 40:48.647
I've endured every drug
and poison known to man.

40:48.715 --> 40:50.949
I fought off
the Ottoman empire.

40:51.017 --> 40:53.318
Do you really think that
I would die at the hands

40:53.385 --> 40:56.688
of a fucking Florentine?

41:02.194 --> 41:05.229
- (Coughs)
- Shit.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.333
Or a mongrel?

41:14.273 --> 41:16.141
How's that for
a military application?

41:17.410 --> 41:20.112
(Splutters)

41:20.179 --> 41:22.915
(Coughs) Zo, wake up!

41:22.983 --> 41:24.383
Wake up! Zo!

41:36.597 --> 41:38.231
- (Groans)
- Life...

41:38.299 --> 41:41.202
Life is a trap,
don't you think?

41:41.269 --> 41:43.270
Well, now,
I'm going to set you free.

41:47.843 --> 41:49.410
(Pants)

41:51.013 --> 41:52.147
Curious.

41:59.188 --> 42:02.256
You cannot kill
a man without a soul.

42:03.158 --> 42:05.026
(Screams)

42:13.101 --> 42:15.636
(Weakly) You must go.

42:15.704 --> 42:18.405
Do not shirk from the task.

42:21.242 --> 42:23.477
(Bell tolls)

42:25.747 --> 42:29.282
(RIARIO) Stay out of Florence
for the next few days.

42:29.350 --> 42:33.453
Oh, and don't speak with
Lorenzo, or anyone in the city.

42:35.656 --> 42:38.892
I suppose
I could go to Siena...

42:38.959 --> 42:43.363
..and create a story to explain
my extended absence, but why?

42:45.499 --> 42:47.067
You've seen what happens,

42:47.135 --> 42:50.705
when people question the plans
of the Vatican, haven't you?

42:50.772 --> 42:52.940
I have.

42:54.276 --> 42:57.579
Speak to nobody
along the road.

42:57.647 --> 43:00.883
And make sure
no-one speaks with you.

43:00.950 --> 43:02.651
That shouldn't
be a problem.

43:02.719 --> 43:05.821
I have a strategy.

43:11.629 --> 43:15.031
- Have some men follow her.
- Of course.

43:15.099 --> 43:17.300
Then discreetly
have her killed.

43:18.969 --> 43:21.270
Her value to us
has been exhausted.

43:21.338 --> 43:24.173
She's...

43:24.241 --> 43:28.344
..compromised by
her affections for Da Vinci.

43:28.412 --> 43:34.117
Did His Holiness
order this?

43:34.185 --> 43:37.420
Do it outside
the walls of Florence.

43:37.488 --> 43:39.122
Leave no ties to Rome.

43:39.189 --> 43:42.125
Make it look like
bandits did it.

43:44.262 --> 43:49.934
Oh, and er...have them drive
stakes through her eyes.

43:52.037 --> 43:54.539
She's seen too much.

43:59.211 --> 44:01.279
(Pants)

44:04.483 --> 44:07.285
The guards, the dogs,
they're gonna rouse soon.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.387
(Grunts)

44:10.690 --> 44:12.323
Where did you get that wound?

44:12.391 --> 44:14.893
There are more urgent
things to explain.

44:14.961 --> 44:17.595
- Did you know this would happen?
- I knew it might.

44:17.663 --> 44:20.498
I had to take that chance,
for the Book of Leaves.

44:20.566 --> 44:22.967
Sword.

44:24.002 --> 44:26.170
Maestro, shall we see to
his injuries?

44:26.238 --> 44:27.805
(Grunts)

44:27.872 --> 44:30.707
They're beyond seeing to and I
cannot meet my end here.

44:30.774 --> 44:32.809
In other words,
fuck this place.

44:32.877 --> 44:34.744
I want to spit on
Vlad's body.

44:36.446 --> 44:38.613
Yeah. Well, you could if
we knew where it was.

44:38.681 --> 44:40.549
Where the fuck is he?

44:40.616 --> 44:42.251
Just come on! Let's go!

44:42.318 --> 44:44.053
Maybe some creature
dragged him off.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.921
Let's not find out. Come on.

44:58.569 --> 45:01.538
You really must try this,
Camilla.

45:01.606 --> 45:03.874
Surely you have a sweeter
tooth than your brother.

45:03.942 --> 45:05.709
You certainly have
a sweeter smile.

45:05.777 --> 45:08.212
Some honey.

45:08.280 --> 45:12.549
The pride
of the Duchy of Urbino.

45:12.617 --> 45:15.285
Oh, I've made arrangements
with their Duke.

45:16.988 --> 45:20.090
With brawn like his, I pity those
who wish harm upon Florence.

45:20.158 --> 45:22.459
You'll have your hands
full with that one.

45:22.527 --> 45:26.563
Federico da Montefeltro's
a...colorful character indeed.

45:26.631 --> 45:30.197
Did you invite us here to show
off your new alliance?

45:30.222 --> 45:30.934
Bernardo!

45:30.935 --> 45:34.203
I don't recall inviting you at
all, Signor Baroncelli.

45:35.839 --> 45:40.476
Perhaps you fail to understand
why I went to Urbino.

45:40.543 --> 45:42.845
You think Rome will
look after the Pazzis

45:42.912 --> 45:44.713
but, when all is said
and done,

45:44.781 --> 45:48.883
Rome only looks after Rome.

45:48.951 --> 45:54.755
And you - both of you -
are loyal sons of Florence.

45:58.260 --> 46:03.497
Don't you think the time has come
for union in our republic...

46:03.565 --> 46:05.532
..not further divisions?

46:08.437 --> 46:12.406
My brother Giuliano has
a stubborn mind,

46:12.474 --> 46:14.408
but a good heart.

46:14.476 --> 46:18.279
At one point, we hoped to
see him in a Cardinal's hat,

46:18.347 --> 46:23.151
but our current relations with
the church have precluded that.

46:23.219 --> 46:28.290
And yet, a young man like
Giuliano, needs a future.

46:30.861 --> 46:34.564
He would make a fine husband
for Camilla...

46:34.632 --> 46:36.432
..would he not?

46:38.702 --> 46:39.936
Honey, anyone?

46:43.408 --> 46:46.143
Farewell.

46:46.210 --> 46:47.277
Arrivederci.

46:50.681 --> 46:53.783
Whether or not the Pazzis agree
to this union, I have to ask,

46:53.850 --> 46:57.553
did you consult your
brother about this?

46:57.621 --> 47:02.158
Giuliano's interests are
the interests of Florence.

47:02.225 --> 47:05.695
I'll have breakable objects removed from
the room before I broach the topic.

47:05.762 --> 47:08.664
She is the child of
our enemy, signor.

47:08.731 --> 47:12.401
Some might argue he is being
thrown to the wolves.

47:12.469 --> 47:15.570
You underestimate
my brother, Piero.

47:15.638 --> 47:18.874
We are not feeding
these wolves.

47:18.942 --> 47:21.110
We are taming them.

47:29.218 --> 47:31.986
Did you know he was
going to propose this?

47:32.054 --> 47:34.756
I had an inkling...

47:34.824 --> 47:37.225
..seeing as it was my idea.

47:41.197 --> 47:44.632
(Moaning)

47:45.701 --> 47:48.502
- You've had your elixir?
- Relax.

47:48.570 --> 47:53.207
They say children conceived in
frustration are born bitter.

47:53.274 --> 47:58.112
You'll understand I'm agitated by
this league of devils around us.

47:58.179 --> 47:59.880
After our ploy with
the Pazzis,

47:59.948 --> 48:02.750
you're not ready for
another master stroke.

48:02.818 --> 48:04.985
(Grunts)

48:05.053 --> 48:11.259
Our doctor said this position is more
likely to conceive us a male heir.

48:11.327 --> 48:14.229
Men would prefer a position
where a woman's face

48:14.296 --> 48:16.531
is rammed down so far
she can't even speak.

48:16.599 --> 48:18.633
I'm sorry, what was that, dear?

48:18.701 --> 48:19.768
(Laughs)

48:19.835 --> 48:21.136
Please.

48:21.203 --> 48:23.171
(Both giggle)

48:45.929 --> 48:48.164
Wooo!

48:48.232 --> 48:49.866
(Groans)

48:51.235 --> 48:53.202
(She giggles)

49:01.845 --> 49:03.880
(She moans)

49:35.647 --> 49:38.282
It was the cage.

49:38.350 --> 49:41.986
It was the cage.
It was the cage.

49:42.054 --> 49:45.489
The words written on the side:
don't take him away.

49:45.557 --> 49:48.926
It wasn't a taunt,
it was a warning.

49:50.629 --> 49:54.265
Vlad built the device to eviscerate
you if you were freed...

49:55.167 --> 49:57.935
..to rip
an unstanchable wound.

49:58.003 --> 50:01.038
I should've realized.

50:01.106 --> 50:03.507
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.

50:03.575 --> 50:07.177
I must tell you
of the key you seek.

50:11.550 --> 50:14.051
The other key that opens
the Vault of Heaven?

50:14.119 --> 50:15.753
Yes, tell me.

50:15.821 --> 50:20.624
It's waiting in Rome,
there for your taking.

50:20.692 --> 50:25.096
And, when you have
both keys...

50:25.163 --> 50:29.533
..your mother,
Caterina

50:29.601 --> 50:32.403
she is alive.

50:34.272 --> 50:38.009
She carries
the Book of Leaves for us,

50:38.076 --> 50:44.014
beneath the post of the sun
in a town made of stone...

50:44.082 --> 50:46.850
..in a land on my map.

50:48.152 --> 50:51.589
Why...I need you
to decode the map.

50:52.957 --> 50:56.092
Then you may take
what you need.

50:56.160 --> 50:58.359
Here.

51:00.264 --> 51:06.035
Here is the secret
to deciphering the map.

51:07.638 --> 51:10.506
I will not survive
to come with you.

51:12.042 --> 51:16.245
You must cut my flesh loose
and take it with you...

51:17.914 --> 51:19.214
..once I die.

51:23.087 --> 51:25.255
The Turk said that
I would save you.

51:25.322 --> 51:28.625
And so you will...

51:28.692 --> 51:31.328
..someday...

51:31.395 --> 51:33.763
..but not today.

51:37.201 --> 51:41.704
But there are so many things
you must learn first.

51:41.772 --> 51:43.606
Yes? Yes?

51:43.673 --> 51:49.478
You must learn
that anything is possible...

51:49.546 --> 51:52.715
..including defeat.

51:54.284 --> 51:59.154
- You must...learn...
- What? What?

51:59.222 --> 52:01.757
(Exhales)

52:04.294 --> 52:07.429
What?

52:07.497 --> 52:09.465
- What? What?
- Maestro...

52:09.532 --> 52:12.100
- I must - must learn what?
- Maestro, he's gone.

52:12.168 --> 52:13.969
- Maestro.
- I must learn what?

52:14.036 --> 52:16.805
I must learn...

52:16.873 --> 52:19.608
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

52:19.676 --> 52:22.745
Fuck! Fuck.

52:22.813 --> 52:24.447
(Breathes heavily)

52:24.514 --> 52:26.982
(Mutters)

52:33.791 --> 52:35.825
I've been here before.

52:35.893 --> 52:38.962
- No, this isn't the path we came in on.
- No. No.

52:40.766 --> 52:44.835
This is where the Abyssinian
and I first met.

52:46.871 --> 52:48.972
He warned me...

52:55.746 --> 52:59.082
I thought
I could solve things...

52:59.149 --> 53:01.351
..like I always do.

53:13.663 --> 53:17.165
Hell happens...

53:17.233 --> 53:20.835
..when the evil of the world
exceeds our belief

53:20.903 --> 53:23.385
that we can conquer it.
