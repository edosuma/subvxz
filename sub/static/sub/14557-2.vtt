WEBVTT

00:22.223 --> 00:24.625
Can I
help you find something?

00:24.658 --> 00:25.593
Uh, no, but

00:25.626 --> 00:26.594
I'd like to see the owner.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.795
Mr. Rausch is with clients

00:27.828 --> 00:29.597
right now. Maybe I
can assist you?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.132
No, it has to be him.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.301
Well, it could be
a little while.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.468
We do have a sitting area.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.669
You can help yourself to some...

00:35.703 --> 00:36.870
RAUSCH:
Now, this is something a bit

00:36.904 --> 00:39.240
more dramatic, but maybe that's
what you were thinking of.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.541
Mr. Rausch?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.343
Uh, if you could give me
just one moment.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.511
I'm sorry.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.613
This really can't wait.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.616
Uh, try it on.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.685
I'll be right back.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.654
What can I do for you?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.094
What-What is this?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.362
Exactly what

01:01.395 --> 01:02.596
it says.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.598
If you don't help me,

01:04.632 --> 01:07.601
your wife and daughter...
are going to die.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.573
What...?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.375
What have you done to them?
Where are they?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.709
Please, just do
as the note says.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.445
The people who
have them--

01:17.478 --> 01:19.313
you have no idea
what they're capable of.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.781
They want diamonds.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.850
( whispers ):
Mr. Rausch!

01:22.883 --> 01:25.153
Okay, okay.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.331
Your wife

01:37.365 --> 01:39.633
and daughter, Mr. Rausch.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.879
Now, I've done everything
you asked.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.281
My family...

01:53.314 --> 01:54.448
Not yet.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.450
If everything goes smoothly--

01:56.484 --> 01:58.152
no police, no FBI--

01:58.186 --> 01:59.520
you'll see them

01:59.553 --> 02:00.588
again in 24 hours.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.889
No, no, that's too long.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.791
I can't...

02:05.459 --> 02:07.728
MAN:
Hold it right there!

02:10.764 --> 02:12.366
MAN:
Don't!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.368
( screams )

02:20.741 --> 02:22.576
I warned her,
told her to stop.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.944
Hey, Don.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.747
So, the owner's wife didn't show
at work today,

02:26.780 --> 02:28.782
and his daughter never made it
to school, either.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.685
All right, so the
kidnapping's real.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.753
Yeah, apparently.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.855
David.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.590
Any idea who she is?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.592
No I.D. Only things
she had on her

02:38.626 --> 02:39.893
were car keys,
sunglasses,

02:39.927 --> 02:41.895
about a half a
million in diamonds

02:41.929 --> 02:43.697
she didn't walk
in here with.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.865
Weapons?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.700
Depends on what you call
a weapon.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.338
( garbled radio transmission )

02:50.371 --> 02:52.306
COLBY:
The old guy said he thought that

02:52.340 --> 02:54.208
she was reaching
for a gun, so...

02:55.809 --> 02:58.346
Well, I hope that shot
just didn't kill three people.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.446
All right, listen up, everybody.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.614
This is Diane Rausch,

03:33.647 --> 03:34.815
the store owner's wife, and

03:34.848 --> 03:36.049
their eight-year-old
daughter, Julia. Now,

03:36.083 --> 03:38.486
we're going to play this as a
kidnapping, first and foremost.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.487
The robbery is secondary.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.289
It's just a means
to get to the kidnappers.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.757
We clear on that?

03:43.791 --> 03:46.627
David, how we doing
on the Jane Doe?

03:46.660 --> 03:47.928
Fingerprints weren't
in the system.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.663
Coroner's checking
dental records,

03:49.697 --> 03:51.699
any kind of medical clue
to identify her.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.367
And the car-- we got anything
with that?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.569
I mean, we find that,
we find out who the woman is.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.004
No. Agents canvassed the
neighborhood near the store.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.772
They didn't find a car
to go with her keys.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.741
DON: We should be looking
into other ways that she might

04:00.774 --> 04:03.411
have gotten there--
bus, car, bicycle...

04:03.444 --> 04:04.512
She was probably driven
by an accomplice.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.447
Statistically, women rarely
commit a crime alone.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.015
-Blame the men, huh, Megan?
-The stats

04:08.048 --> 04:09.717
blame the men, Granger.
I'm just quoting them.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.685
Come on. Let's just
find this woman.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.686
It's our only way we're gonna

04:12.720 --> 04:13.754
save this kid and her mother.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.055
All right?
Any questions?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.391
-Let's do it.
-After what happened,

04:17.425 --> 04:18.726
we have to be worried
about their chances.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.328
Let's just assume
they're alive,

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
and then their chances
are better, right?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.934
Don.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.636
Hey, Charlie.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.937
What are you
doing here?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.005
I'm dropping this off
for you, man.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.374
You are?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.542
What is it?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.743
Wow. What is it?
I don't know.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.611
It's the geographic crime index
you pretty much begged me

04:37.645 --> 04:39.547
to put together for you.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.748
I found some fairly

04:40.781 --> 04:41.915
fascinating patterns
in here, as well.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
I mean, you should
be thanking me.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.319
Right. Right, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.321
I'm up all night indexing.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.489
Yeah, well, Charlie, you know,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.623
we just got
this kidnapping case.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.359
It's a mother and her
eight-year-old daughter, so...

04:51.392 --> 04:53.461
Kidnapped by whom?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.329
Only lead we have is a Jane Doe.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.064
What do you
know about her?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.533
Well, I mean,
she wears sunglasses

04:59.567 --> 05:01.569
and drives a Saturn,
which we can't find.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.371
Are these her keys?

05:03.404 --> 05:04.738
Yeah. We did a search
for the car,

05:04.772 --> 05:05.906
but it didn't turn up.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.541
Keyless entry remote actually

05:07.575 --> 05:09.610
poses a fairly interesting
mathematical problem.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.778
Oh, yeah?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.545
And how is that?

05:11.579 --> 05:12.946
Well, much
of the general populace

05:12.980 --> 05:14.748
has a remote nowadays,
don't they?

05:14.782 --> 05:15.983
I mean, I think I read somewhere

05:16.016 --> 05:18.085
where 80% of new cars come
with a remote.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.020
-Yeah, well, thanks.
-Hold on.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.356
Every remote has
to have a unique,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.024
one-to-one relationship
with a single car.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.427
Otherwise, you walk out
into a parking lot,

05:26.460 --> 05:27.428
push that button.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.062
Any number
of cars might unlock.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.631
( beeping )

05:30.664 --> 05:32.533
So, you're saying
each car has its own frequency?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.701
No. That's just it.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.869
They're all
on the same frequency.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.371
( beep )

05:37.405 --> 05:38.772
Every remote has
a numerical code

05:38.806 --> 05:41.675
that links it to just one car.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.711
You see, people don't often
think about this stuff,

05:43.744 --> 05:44.878
but it's an entirely
math-based technology.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.048
You know who might be able
to help you with this is Larry.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.150
His cosmic listening project
at Kitt Peak

05:50.183 --> 05:51.752
involves
stacked frequency work.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.621
Well, I got
to find this woman's car,

05:53.654 --> 05:56.657
so anything you or Larry can do,
I mean, I would appreciate it.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.691
( garbled radio transmission )

05:57.725 --> 05:59.693
So the last time you saw
your wife and daughter,

05:59.727 --> 06:00.961
they were eating
breakfast.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.396
They were sitting at
the kitchen table.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.564
I kissed them good-bye,
left for work.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.966
Right. And your wife drives
Julia to school?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.469
That's our routine, every day.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.471
One of the neighbors saw
'em pull out around 8:30.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.772
Said everything
looked normal.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.140
( garbled radio transmission )

06:13.173 --> 06:14.642
( clock ticking )

06:14.675 --> 06:16.043
God, I just can't imagine

06:16.076 --> 06:17.277
what they're going through
right now.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.080
The best thing you could do
for them is just to stay calm

06:20.113 --> 06:21.281
and stay focused.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.552
Mr. Rausch, did you happen
to notice anyone hanging around,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.587
or any strange cars parked
on the street?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.423
Anything that just didn't
quite seem to belong?

06:29.457 --> 06:30.658
( stuttering ):
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.825
Nothing comes to mind.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.495
So, what...?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.629
-what happens next?
-COLBY: Well, we'll set up

06:35.663 --> 06:37.665
a command center in your house
and monitor your calls.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.066
That way,
in case the kidnappers try

06:39.099 --> 06:40.468
to contact you...

06:40.501 --> 06:41.635
A command center?
No, I don't want that.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.704
You know, Mr.
Rausch, we need...

06:43.737 --> 06:45.673
The last thing this woman said
was, "No police, no FBI."

06:45.706 --> 06:46.807
If these people
call back...

06:46.840 --> 06:48.742
If they call, I'll do exactly

06:48.776 --> 06:49.743
what they say.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.779
I'll pay whatever they ask.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.581
I just want my family back!

06:55.949 --> 06:57.951
"No police, no FBI?"

06:57.985 --> 06:59.987
Rausch could wind up
a target himself.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.523
Yep. That's why we're gonna put
a line on his phone,

07:02.556 --> 07:04.057
keep him under
surveillance.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.859
Yeah.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.927
( electrical humming, beep )

07:06.960 --> 07:09.630
Hey, Charlie, have you ever
considered our place

07:09.663 --> 07:10.964
in the universe?

07:10.998 --> 07:13.601
Certainly every time we speak.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.735
More to the point.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.103
You know, galaxies

07:16.136 --> 07:18.706
are constantly
moving away from us.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.741
And the farther
away they are,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.176
the faster they're
leaving us behind.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.746
This is more to what point,
again?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.615
Amita, Charlie.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.782
-Oh.
-No, wait, wait, wait.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.584
As you let that
opportunity drift away,

07:30.618 --> 07:33.787
it moves faster, and
it moves farther.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.656
It's more complicated than that.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.557
And no matter how
complicated

07:36.590 --> 07:38.559
the shape and structure
of a large star,

07:38.592 --> 07:40.661
you-you take away
the nuclear fuel,

07:40.694 --> 07:41.695
it becomes what?

07:41.729 --> 07:42.930
A black hole.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.032
Mixing cosmic metaphors again,
are we?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.767
-No, it was galaxies, then
stars... -Our relationship

07:46.800 --> 07:47.901
is not a black hole. Okay?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.637
-Sorry, guys.
-It's not a black hole.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.605
You're not having a little
lovers' spat are you?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.173
No, he...
Larry just likes to...

07:53.206 --> 07:54.942
Why do you like to talk
about every other problem

07:54.975 --> 07:56.710
except the one you're currently
working on at the moment?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.646
Hey, hey, hey,
what problem?

07:58.679 --> 08:00.981
Receiver is hooked up, so
you just take that remote there,

08:01.014 --> 08:02.750
you hit the
button, and

08:02.783 --> 08:04.852
the emitted data
stream will be captured

08:04.885 --> 08:06.954
and conveyed right
to the computer.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.756
Okay, I got it.
Here you go.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.657
( beeps )

08:09.690 --> 08:11.058
All right,
that's the code

08:11.091 --> 08:12.626
that tells the car door to open.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.562
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, let's try another one.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.564
( beeping )

08:16.597 --> 08:17.831
That's a different number.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.199
Because it's a rolling code.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.768
Every time I hit the key,

08:20.801 --> 08:21.835
it sends out a different signal

08:21.869 --> 08:23.036
to the car.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.237
Right. So?

08:24.271 --> 08:25.706
Well, it's like a pitcher.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.607
If he throws the same fastball

08:26.640 --> 08:28.676
every single throw,
what would happen?

08:28.709 --> 08:29.810
Lots of hits.
He'd get pulled.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.579
It's the same with a radio code.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.747
If this key sent out
the same signal every time,

08:33.781 --> 08:35.549
well then, it would be easy

08:35.583 --> 08:37.985
for someone else
to intercept it.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.554
With a rolling code,
the pitcher needs to mix it up.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.923
Okay, he's throwing curveballs,
he's throwing sliders.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.958
All right, so if the remote's
sending a different signal,

08:44.992 --> 08:46.760
then how does the car
understand it?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.195
The change is predictable,

08:48.228 --> 08:50.831
as long as you know
the algorithm that generates it.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.200
It could be as simple
as adding plus one,

08:53.233 --> 08:54.735
like the catcher adding
a single finger

08:54.768 --> 08:58.038
every time
he signals the next pitch.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.140
So, then it doesn't matter if
the combination's different,

09:00.173 --> 09:02.109
as long as the remote
and the car know it.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.144
However, with this remote,

09:04.177 --> 09:07.014
the algorithm's considerably
more complicated.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.081
We're looking

09:08.115 --> 09:10.317
at a sequence, like,
32 hexadecimal digits long.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.019
I mean, that-that's long.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.925
It's a matter
of finding the algorithm

09:17.958 --> 09:19.259
that changes the sequence.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.861
The more data I collect,
the easier

09:20.894 --> 09:22.630
it'll be for me
to deduce that algorithm.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.266
Hence, my preference
for classic automobiles.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.334
Standard lock and
key technology.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.769
Keep your heated seats...

09:28.802 --> 09:30.170
DON:
Guys, look, I'm dealing

09:30.203 --> 09:31.639
with a kidnapping
here, okay?

09:31.672 --> 09:33.140
Statistically, the more time
that goes by,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.675
the worse our
chances are getting.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.644
I got you. We're on it.
We're moving

09:36.677 --> 09:37.645
as fast as we can
for you.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.382
You're sorting those?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.652
Based on what?

09:44.685 --> 09:47.688
The ones I like
and the ones I don't.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.222
Looking at the quality.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.791
See if she knew
what she was doing.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.293
She's not in the system.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.263
She has no criminal history,
no record.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.700
And she wakes up this morning
and decides to become a felon.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.169
Maybe she's never been caught
before.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.336
I don't see how,
with her habits.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.404
I mean, look at her.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.707
She's making absolutely
no attempt

10:06.740 --> 10:07.741
to avoid the cameras.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.909
And her hands...

10:08.942 --> 10:10.043
Her fingerprints
are on the top

10:10.077 --> 10:11.812
of every counter in there.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.080
And look right there.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.683
What?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.618
She looks terrified.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.959
( rock music playing )

10:29.362 --> 10:32.666
*

10:51.051 --> 10:52.786
Oh, hey, Amita.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.121
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hi.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.222
What's going on?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.356
What are you working on?

10:56.389 --> 10:57.457
Something for Don.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.426
It's part of
a kidnapping case.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.862
Although, um, right now, I'm not
really seeing a solution.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.363
Can I help?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.364
Please do.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.734
I'm trying to determine
a generating algorithm

11:06.767 --> 11:08.902
from a series
of coded data streams.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.105
You're working this
as a straight rolling code.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.306
Yeah.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.210
Well, for the first
half, definitely.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.713
You've proved it.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.449
But for the second half...

11:22.482 --> 11:25.485
I don't know.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.088
Have you tried
a 1-D cellular automaton?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.689
What, like...

11:31.458 --> 11:34.161
Wolfram's Discrete
Computability Theories.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.428
Yeah.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.730
It's just a thought.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.266
That's a great thought.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.403
What?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.239
What are you smiling about?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.508
Would you want to...

11:48.541 --> 11:51.344
do something with me
after we're done here?

11:51.378 --> 11:56.149
Charlie, are you actually
asking me out on a date?

11:56.183 --> 12:00.921
You and me, talking about
anything except work.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.489
What do you say?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.261
Yes.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.262
( both chuckle )

12:11.364 --> 12:13.533
MEGAN: The coroner's report
on our Jane Doe:

12:13.566 --> 12:15.936
no traceable dental work.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.504
She's never even
had a cavity.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.539
Yeah, so we got
a jewel thief who flosses, huh?

12:19.572 --> 12:20.941
Anything else we can trace?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.142
Contact lenses,
breast implants...

12:22.175 --> 12:24.211
The contact lenses are
generic mail-order,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.445
so there's no
serial numbers.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.248
And her breasts-- believe
it or not-- are real... in L.A.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.483
I mean, that wasn't the
nose she was born with,

12:30.517 --> 12:32.385
which won't help
our case at all,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.822
but at least it'll help me
sleep better at night

12:34.855 --> 12:36.356
knowing she
wasn't perfect.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.457
Thanks.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.526
We were able to narrow
the window on the abduction.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.161
Looks like they were grabbed
somewhere between home

12:41.194 --> 12:42.262
and the daughter's school.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.798
Colby, how we doing
on the set up at Rausch's house?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.466
Get this:
Rausch wouldn't allow it.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.567
Wouldn't allow it?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.402
Seems to think
he has a better shot

12:49.436 --> 12:50.904
getting them back on his own.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.005
Come on.
Wrong move there.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.773
-We mentioned that.
-( cell phone rings )

12:54.875 --> 12:56.276
Eppes.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.210
Hey, bro, it's me.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.079
I, uh, calculated
the program algorithm--

12:59.112 --> 13:00.513
Jane Doe's car keys.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.816
And I'm e-mailing it
to you right now.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.051
Yeah?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.185
Did you get it?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.988
Uh, hold on.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.522
Yeah, I'm getting it.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.859
I mean, I don't know
what this means.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.493
It should mean something
to the car manufacturer.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.562
This algorithm is specific
to one car.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.597
They should be able
to tell you which one.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.900
The DMV can tell you
who the current owner is.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.369
All right,
good, Charlie, thanks.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.337
DON:
I don't see the Saturn.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.939
Everybody just hold.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.979
Spotter's got one
white male in his 50s

13:32.012 --> 13:34.948
in the front living room, and
there's no sign of anyone else.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.417
All right, let's get everyone
in position.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.487
Tell David.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.629
Can I help you?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.064
( Caribbean accent ): Yes,
I have a package here

13:51.098 --> 13:52.499
for Erica Logan.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.434
-Erica's not here.
-Ah, well, maybe you

13:54.467 --> 13:55.568
can sign for her?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.270
Well, sure, okay.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.505
FBI. Quiet.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.506
Okay, okay.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.074
Who else
is in the house?

14:01.108 --> 14:04.644
No one, no one's here
but me.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.579
FBI!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.949
FBI! FBI!

14:11.952 --> 14:13.420
-Clear!
-Clear!

14:13.453 --> 14:15.255
-Clear!
-What?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.223
What's going on?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.291
You the registered owner
of a 2001 Saturn Ion?

14:18.325 --> 14:19.526
Yes, it's my
daughter's car.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.961
Your daughter?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
Erica, but she isn't
here right now.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.396
She's at school.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.932
What, she's a student?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.234
No, a teacher.
Kindergarten.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
Your daughter's
a kindergarten teacher?

14:28.969 --> 14:29.569
Why?

14:29.602 --> 14:30.904
What's going on?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.405
Is this her?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.441
Yes.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.542
Where is she?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.478
Where's Erica?!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.923
This doesn't make any sense.

14:49.957 --> 14:53.593
She can't be dead.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.662
You must have
the wrong girl.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.998
Uh, sir, I'm sorry,
we don't.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.969
My wife died
when Erica was 12.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.137
Her brother
Remy was six.

15:04.171 --> 15:08.942
Erica kept us going,
kept us together.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.945
How could someone like that
ever be involved in a robbery?

15:11.979 --> 15:14.481
When was the last time
you saw or spoke to her?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.548
This morning.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.150
She lives here with you?

15:17.184 --> 15:20.020
Well... my health
hasn't been so great.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.957
Erica moved back in about
a year ago to look after me.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.158
What about a boyfriend?

15:25.192 --> 15:27.995
Someone who might be able
to explain what happened today.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.530
Well, truth is, taking care
of me and her brother

15:30.563 --> 15:33.633
didn't give her much time
to live her own life, but...

15:33.666 --> 15:35.435
-( cell phone rings )
-...tell you this.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.370
whatever did happen,

15:37.404 --> 15:40.440
there's got to be more to it.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.010
Don.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.544
They found the wife's car.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.645
( unintelligible
radio transmission )

15:45.678 --> 15:47.680
It's Mrs. Rausch's car.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.250
Last time she
and her daughter were seen

15:50.283 --> 15:52.552
was this morning
pulling out of the house.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.321
Kid's school is about
three blocks from here,

15:54.354 --> 15:56.056
so obviously they
knew a route.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.225
Kidnapped in broad daylight?

15:58.258 --> 15:59.359
Looks like they
were rear-ended.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.462
Now, make sure we get some
paint scrapings here, huh?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.364
That's got to be
how they were grabbed.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.999
Get hit from behind,
hop out to swap

16:06.033 --> 16:07.434
insurance information.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.635
I got a shoe here.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.437
It matches
what Rausch said

16:10.470 --> 16:12.272
the little girl was wearing
this morning

16:13.373 --> 16:17.010
Thanks.

16:17.044 --> 16:20.413
So looks like
it happened fast, right?

16:20.447 --> 16:21.781
I mean, it was well-planned,
well-executed,

16:21.814 --> 16:24.317
they knew her routine.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.286
Got a freeway
right around the corner.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.021
Not dealing with
amateurs here.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.457
Nah, there's no question
these guys were pros.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.426
Yeah, who used a kindergarten
teacher as their bag man.

16:37.130 --> 16:41.534
And no word, no contact,
in almost seven hours.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.271
What the hell are they after?

16:44.304 --> 16:47.240
MEGAN: I still think Erica Logan
has to be the key.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.442
This kind of radical shift
in behavior?

16:49.476 --> 16:51.311
There has to be
some sort of trigger.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.712
Trigger. Like what?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.647
I can tell you
what a textbook would say.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.251
Statistically, it's things
like a near-death experience.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.354
A person can exhibit an
extreme shift in behavior

17:01.388 --> 17:03.490
if they survived a plane crash.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.059
Another could be a person
who's told they only

17:06.093 --> 17:09.396
have a month to live, may act
on fantasies of an alter ego.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.463
Doesn't fit, though,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.532
in this case-- the autopsy
would have flagged that.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.267
All right, so what else?

17:14.301 --> 17:16.336
Uh, parental instinct--

17:16.369 --> 17:18.305
the perception
of a serious threat to a child.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.406
That also doesn't fit.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.441
I mean, her father said
she doesn't have kids, right?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.076
But there was a brother--
right-- the old man

17:23.110 --> 17:25.145
-said she practically raised
him. -Yeah.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.146
A younger sibling

17:26.179 --> 17:27.214
could be the trigger,

17:27.247 --> 17:28.848
if they had developed
that kind of relationship.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.650
Younger brothers can definitely
be a trigger, trust me.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.751
Go talk to the old man,

17:31.784 --> 17:34.787
see if we can get an address
on the son-- I want to get

17:34.821 --> 17:36.656
everything we can
on this kid, right?

17:36.689 --> 17:40.460
( soft jazz playing )

17:40.493 --> 17:43.296
CHARLIE:
So, by the way, I wanted to, uh,

17:43.330 --> 17:45.832
thank you so much for earlier,
for helping me.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.568
Honestly, I think I would have
stared at those boards all day

17:48.601 --> 17:50.503
if you hadn't come up with
the cellular automaton angle,

17:50.537 --> 17:51.704
so... you rock.
( chuckles )

17:51.738 --> 17:56.343
It was one of those weird
inspiration things, you know?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.279
Coming at it
with fresh eyes.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.114
It's funny, 'cause
my first thought

18:01.148 --> 18:02.549
was the universal
conductor approach,

18:02.582 --> 18:06.486
but then I realized...

18:06.519 --> 18:07.887
Then you what?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.389
We're doing it
again, Charlie.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.192
We're talking about work.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.494
We said we weren't gonna
talk about work, remember?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.529
Yeah... I remember.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.730
Okay.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.545
This is ridiculous.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.582
It's ridiculous.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.285
We have to be able to talk about
something not work related.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.819
We can have a normal
conversation, right?

18:39.852 --> 18:43.156
We can have a conversation.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.196
What's wrong with us?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.863
I don't know.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.633
Pressure...
pressure, maybe.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.834
Yeah.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.304
Maybe it's pressure.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.774
Thanks.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.277
Okay, thanks,
thanks a lot.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.645
Whoa.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.946
Look at this.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.716
See that?
It's Romanesque broccoli.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.285
I've actually only ever seen
pictures of it, and there's...

19:12.319 --> 19:15.655
there's a fractal pattern
in here that's... amazing.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.724
How cool is it
there's a vegetable

19:17.757 --> 19:20.193
that grows in the ground
that has fractals,

19:20.227 --> 19:21.594
and at the same time,
we're discovering

19:21.628 --> 19:22.762
their importance
in astrophysics?

19:22.795 --> 19:24.431
( chuckles )

19:24.464 --> 19:27.567
It really makes
you wonder...

19:27.600 --> 19:30.570
Yeah.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.909
( clears throat )
Bon appГ©tit.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.984
You were right.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.220
Brother's name is
Remy Logan, got a sheet

19:47.254 --> 19:48.721
goes back to when
he was a juvie.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.723
Oh, yeah, look at this:
petty theft,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.892
narcotics, gambling charges...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.427
Ooh. Just the kind
of little brother

19:54.461 --> 19:55.728
that could complicate
a sister's life.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.297
We know where he is?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.698
Yeah, David just called
with that address.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.832
All right, go pick him up.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.304
( rock music playing )

20:11.778 --> 20:12.879
Wow.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.782
What do you suppose the rent is
on a place like this?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.418
I don't know...
like, two grand, $2,500.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.886
You looking to move?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.821
The place I'm in
doesn't have a pool.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.490
I'm just kind of thinking
here I am,

20:23.523 --> 20:24.991
moved all the way to L.A.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.659
Should have a pool, you know?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.828
Absolutely, man, a pool's
a birthright around here.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.832
Here it is.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.302
Six.

20:40.307 --> 20:43.576
His car's in the garage.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.481
There's someone in there.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.516
( knocking )

20:49.549 --> 20:51.284
Remy Logan! FBI.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.485
Open up!

20:52.519 --> 20:53.686
He's going out the back.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.859
FBI. Stop!

20:59.892 --> 21:01.027
FBI!

21:01.060 --> 21:02.429
Stop, or I'll shoot you!

21:02.462 --> 21:03.996
Hey! I don't have a gun!

21:04.030 --> 21:04.631
Get down!

21:04.664 --> 21:06.433
Okay, just don't shoot me.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.700
We're not gonna
shoot you.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.436
Just did not feel like
chasing you today.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.447
Looks like somebody's
been packing,

21:20.480 --> 21:21.781
gettin' ready to leave.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.616
Who you running from, Remy?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.752
I'm just taking
a little time away,

21:25.785 --> 21:26.686
that's all.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.589
There's nothing illegal
about that, right?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.491
No. You weren't planning
on sticking around

21:31.524 --> 21:32.559
to bury your sister?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.328
Yeah, we know all about
the whole jewelry store

21:35.362 --> 21:36.663
robbery thing.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.331
And the kidnapping
of the little girl

21:38.365 --> 21:40.600
and her mother.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.702
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.004
Remy, I read your file.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.973
I talked with your old man.
I know the whole story.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.041
You're the screw-up
little brother.

21:49.075 --> 21:49.909
And Erica--

21:49.942 --> 21:51.944
well, she was
the caring big sister

21:51.978 --> 21:53.880
who always got stuck
bailing you out.

21:54.981 --> 21:55.948
Now, the problem is...

21:55.982 --> 21:58.084
Erica was just killed

21:58.117 --> 21:59.952
during the commission
of a robbery.

21:59.986 --> 22:00.953
And if you're involved,

22:00.987 --> 22:04.023
that puts you on the
hook for felony murder.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.358
But the kidnapping--

22:05.392 --> 22:06.859
if you're
involved in that,

22:06.893 --> 22:08.895
might just land you
strapped to a gurney.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.034
Remy... listen.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.369
Talk to us.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.537
Where are they?

22:17.570 --> 22:21.040
Where's this mother
and her little girl?

22:21.073 --> 22:22.675
I don't know.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.976
David, check this out.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.950
You run a book
operation?

22:32.885 --> 22:33.820
Hey, who's your bank?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.154
I don't work for anyone.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.556
That's funny--
you know, I never met

22:36.589 --> 22:38.157
an independent bookie
who didn't have

22:38.190 --> 22:40.560
a safe, two armed guards, and at
least three dead bolts

22:40.593 --> 22:41.561
on the front door.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.162
You don't work

22:43.195 --> 22:44.130
for anybody, huh?

22:45.898 --> 22:50.069
Here's all the bets
he pushed through.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.539
ALAN: Oh, come on, Charlie,
it couldn't have been that bad.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.508
Actually, I truly
can't explain

22:55.542 --> 22:57.109
how awful it was.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.110
Oh, I don't
understand it.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.146
You and Amita--
you always got along so well.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.082
I'm just as confused as you are.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.185
Yeah, well, maybe
it'll be better next time, hmm?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.587
Yeah, I don't think
there's going to be

23:07.620 --> 23:08.588
a "next time"
in my future.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.756
No, no,
you do not give up.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.057
You never give up.

23:11.090 --> 23:11.991
Who's giving up what?

23:12.024 --> 23:15.795
Charlie. He blew
his first date with Amita.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.697
I wouldn't say
that I-I "blew it," Dad.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.466
I mean, that's...

23:19.499 --> 23:21.434
Yeah, maybe I blew it.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.735
Wait, what happened, buddy?

23:22.769 --> 23:23.736
It's just
we found out

23:23.770 --> 23:25.071
that we really don't have

23:25.104 --> 23:28.007
much to talk about...
outside math.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.109
Oh, man.
Yeah, I know about that.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.110
Maybe it's an Eppes thing.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.612
When Terry and I
started dating,

23:32.645 --> 23:33.580
the first thing we said

23:33.613 --> 23:35.081
was we weren't going to talk
about work, right?

23:35.114 --> 23:36.082
You know, not a word.

23:36.115 --> 23:36.949
So, how'd you work it out?

23:36.983 --> 23:41.187
Well... I mean,
she's back with her ex.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.122
That's really
very encouraging.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.791
DON: Well, I didn't mean
it like that.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.092
I'm sorry. It's different
with you guys.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.960
You'll work it out.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.729
Meanwhile, I'm hitting a wall
with this case.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.197
You haven't found them yet?

23:51.230 --> 23:52.298
Found whom?

23:52.331 --> 23:54.901
A mother and her eight-year-old
daughter, kidnapped.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.069
That's horrible.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.104
Who took them?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.105
I don't... We don't know yet.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.207
I mean, we got this one suspects
who's a bookie,

24:01.240 --> 24:02.809
and we think
there's some connection,

24:02.842 --> 24:04.644
but we got these files
off his computer,

24:04.677 --> 24:06.112
and they're impossible
to analyze.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.147
What are you looking
for in there?

24:08.180 --> 24:11.150
Well, I mean, the people
who financed the operation.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.218
This guy's
been running bets

24:12.251 --> 24:13.019
through a Web site

24:13.052 --> 24:14.787
called "Statzwire"
that dead-ends

24:14.821 --> 24:16.789
at a URL in China.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.725
With all the money
he's pulling in and paying out,

24:18.758 --> 24:20.793
we can't tell the difference
between the backers and bettors.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.229
Well, these abbreviations
may be names and dates,

24:23.262 --> 24:25.498
but the numbers in
this column here--

24:25.532 --> 24:27.967
35-17-11,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.236
23-17-5,

24:30.269 --> 24:32.171
24-12-three and a half?

24:32.204 --> 24:35.241
Yeah. I'm assuming
that they're part of some sort

24:35.274 --> 24:37.510
of odds-making,
but they just appear to be

24:37.544 --> 24:38.678
at random,
and they can't be.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.079
You're right.
They're not random.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.682
What are you talking about?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.684
Where's that paper?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.220
This weekend's

24:48.254 --> 24:49.989
football scores.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.224
Let me see.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.561
35-17-11 here.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.228
The Packers beat
the Vikings 35-17,

24:56.262 --> 24:57.864
and the
spread was 11.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.032
Whoa.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.033
23-17-5. That...

25:01.067 --> 25:02.535
Here, Niners

25:02.569 --> 25:05.071
in San Diego, five-
point spread, right?

25:05.104 --> 25:08.107
24 to 12 was the Jaguars
over the Colts. Huh?

25:08.140 --> 25:09.976
-Let me see that.
-Three and a half

25:10.009 --> 25:10.977
was a ridiculous spread.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.112
I took the Jaguars and
made a hundred bucks.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.981
What, you have a bookie?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.683
Should I have a lawyer present?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.117
No, I'll let you slide.

25:18.150 --> 25:18.951
CHARLIE:
Wait a minute.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.152
If this column
is the point spread,

25:20.186 --> 25:23.055
I can use it to calculate
the ratio of winners to losers,

25:23.089 --> 25:27.627
and potentially trace
the payouts and the money flow.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.095
A surprising amount

25:29.128 --> 25:31.130
of math applies itself
to gambling.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.966
The most important application--
at least for the bookie--

25:34.000 --> 25:36.268
is determining the point spread,
which is this column

25:36.302 --> 25:37.837
right here.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.106
Now, ideally...

25:40.139 --> 25:43.976
a bookie wants to take
equal amounts of money

25:44.010 --> 25:46.045
on each side of a game.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.179
However...

25:47.213 --> 25:51.618
sometimes one team is
obviously better than another.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.919
He has to adjust

25:52.952 --> 25:53.853
the point spread.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.857
He has to draw bets
to the weak side...

25:57.890 --> 25:58.991
and keep the balance.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.893
See, he keeps the balance,

26:00.927 --> 26:03.630
and he doesn't have pay the
winners out of his own pocket.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.098
They get paid
with the losers' money.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.266
So what's in it for the bookie?

26:07.299 --> 26:08.701
The "juice."

26:08.735 --> 26:10.136
You got it.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.805
For every dollar lost...

26:12.839 --> 26:14.874
the bookie takes about a dime.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.142
With his balanced spread,

26:16.175 --> 26:18.778
he's making a four-and-a-half
percent profit on all the action

26:18.811 --> 26:20.379
he's taking,
which means

26:20.412 --> 26:22.014
for a bettor
to simply break even,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.183
he's got to be right
more than 50% the time.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.252
52.38% of the time.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.789
Good deal for the book;
not so good for the bettors.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
Now, once I figured out
the profit stream,

26:31.223 --> 26:33.760
it was fairly easy for me
to separate out the juice,

26:33.793 --> 26:36.929
and that led me
to this bank account.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.631
The bank number
puts us

26:38.665 --> 26:41.067
at Pacific World Bank
in Santa Monica.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.234
That has to be the backers.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.302
CHARLIE:
The kidnappers?

26:43.335 --> 26:45.071
Colby, track down the bank
manager, the president--

26:45.104 --> 26:46.639
I don't care--
just wake them up,

26:46.673 --> 26:47.774
get the name on that account.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.708
All right?

26:48.741 --> 26:50.877
Good job, Charlie.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.311
This list of names--
where did you get these?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.247
I-I took them straight
from the books themselves.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.016
They're a list
of the suspect's clients.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.318
Why? What's wrong?

26:59.351 --> 27:00.987
Can you put this page
on the screen?

27:01.020 --> 27:02.221
Sure can.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.156
Now scroll down

27:04.190 --> 27:05.157
about halfway.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.161
Stop.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.731
Right there.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.665
Rausch,

27:12.699 --> 27:13.399
the store owner?

27:13.432 --> 27:14.433
He's one of
Remy Logan's

27:14.466 --> 27:15.702
gambling clients?

27:15.735 --> 27:18.237
These numbers indicate he's lost
substantial amounts of money.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.139
Well, how substantial?

27:20.172 --> 27:22.742
CHARLIE:
$180,000.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.044
That ties Rausch

27:25.077 --> 27:26.312
to Remy, and through Remy,

27:26.345 --> 27:27.379
right to the kidnappers.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.216
Wait... Rausch is
right in the middle of all this?

27:39.959 --> 27:42.228
COLBY:
Don, Rausch is in the wind.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.229
What do you mean?

27:43.262 --> 27:44.764
What happened
to our surveillance?

27:44.797 --> 27:46.332
They were on him, and they lost
him in traffic.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.034
Now he's not answering
his cell phone.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.869
I mean, he's waiting on the
biggest call of his life.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.038
You know, maybe
he's already gotten the call.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.040
No. We're monitoring his phone,
and there's nothing.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.708
Well, maybe he's got
another cell phone, right?

27:55.742 --> 27:57.877
Call all the locals and have
them issue an alert, all right?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.178
-All right.
-I got through on the account

27:59.211 --> 28:00.479
Charlie gave us
for Remy's backers.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.249
Traced back to these two.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.318
Brian and Chris Reynolds.
Brothers.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.821
They cleaned out the account
less than an hour

28:08.855 --> 28:09.789
after the robbery
went bad.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.257
'Cause they knew
it was only a matter of time

28:11.290 --> 28:13.125
till we would find Remy
and connect it to them.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.828
Oh, yeah, look at this-- these
are definitely our kidnappers.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.096
Extortion, extortion,
conspiracy...

28:17.129 --> 28:19.766
Older one had
a grade-fixing charge

28:19.799 --> 28:20.632
while he was at SC.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.134
Younger one's got
a violent streak.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.402
Goes back to juvie.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.137
Any idea how we can find them?

28:25.171 --> 28:27.273
The address on the bank account
was traced to a P.O. box--

28:27.306 --> 28:28.975
this little mail center
in San Pedro--

28:29.008 --> 28:31.110
but the owner hasn't seen
anyone, not in weeks.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.511
These guys could be
anywhere right now.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.645
Yeah, well, I mean,
you got to figure

28:33.679 --> 28:35.815
the kid and the mother
are slowing them down, right?

28:38.350 --> 28:39.986
Hey, look, until we find
dead bodies,

28:40.019 --> 28:41.220
this is
still a search-and-rescue.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.989
-Ready?
-Yeah.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.227
Where are they?

28:48.260 --> 28:51.197
I never seen either one of them.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.298
Oh, no? I know
you've been pushing bets

28:52.331 --> 28:54.934
through their wire to the tune
of five figures a week,

28:54.967 --> 28:56.202
-you hear me?
-We know about Martin Rausch.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.004
We know he's your client.

28:58.037 --> 28:58.971
I'll make it
clear as possible.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.306
We got a line between them
and the kidnapping.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.774
Know who's
in the middle of it?

29:01.808 --> 29:03.142
So if you know where
these guys are,

29:03.175 --> 29:04.443
this would be the
time to tell us.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.878
I don't.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.247
I swear I don't.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.181
Oh, I believe you.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.853
( sighs ):
Look...

29:13.886 --> 29:15.154
Rausch got way behind.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.423
Chris and Brian said
if I couldn't collect,

29:17.456 --> 29:18.991
it was coming out of me,

29:19.025 --> 29:20.126
one way or the other.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.228
So then you got your sister
to pull the robbery for you?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.395
No, it was supposed
to be no big deal.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.497
You just take the diamonds,
and you show the picture,

29:25.531 --> 29:27.133
and you come out,
and I go to the parking lot.

29:29.335 --> 29:32.939
She did what she did to help me,
to save my life.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.044
DON:
So, Martin Rausch is a gambler.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.178
-MEGAN: Mm-hmm.
-Right? He's a bad one.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.213
He gets himself
in debt to Remy.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.182
Which puts Remy in trouble
with his backers.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.516
That kind of cash,
I'm surprised

29:44.550 --> 29:46.018
that they didn't
just kill Rausch.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.519
But dead guys don't pay.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.221
Ultimately,
they just want their money.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.190
So they find out
he owns a jewelry store...

29:51.223 --> 29:55.194
So they kidnap his family
and make Remy pull the robbery?

29:55.227 --> 29:56.528
It's not a bad plan.

29:56.562 --> 29:57.529
No. It's a damn good plan.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.331
I mean, they get their money,
probably more,

29:59.365 --> 30:01.067
and they can count on him
to keep his mouth shut

30:01.100 --> 30:01.868
because of his gambling.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.235
Only thing they
didn't count on

30:03.269 --> 30:04.904
was the security guard.

30:04.937 --> 30:05.905
Rausch's phone records.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.039
Three hours ago,

30:07.073 --> 30:08.975
there's a call from his wife's
cell phone to a number

30:09.008 --> 30:10.142
-we don't have.
-They called Rausch

30:10.176 --> 30:10.977
on her phone?

30:11.010 --> 30:12.211
I guess.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.080
No way to trace it
back to Reynolds, then.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.248
The thing is, what does he have
to give them at this point?

30:16.282 --> 30:18.417
We know he doesn't
have any money.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.586
CLAUDIA: Yeah, Martin was here
a little earlier.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.955
I told him it was silly,
that he didn't need to be here

30:22.989 --> 30:24.056
while all this
was still going on.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.958
Was he near
any of the jewelry?

30:25.992 --> 30:27.559
Could he have stolen
anything?

30:27.593 --> 30:29.996
Steal? Why would he steal
from his own store?

30:30.029 --> 30:30.897
Was he near any
of the jewelry?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.531
No. The insurance company's
locked up

30:32.564 --> 30:33.565
all the merchandise
since the robbery.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.435
They need to do a full inventory
before we reopen.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.636
Okay, think about it.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.006
Is there anything else the
insurance company didn't lock?

30:40.039 --> 30:41.407
No.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.608
You do repairs here?

30:42.641 --> 30:43.609
CLAUDIA:
Yeah.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.377
And they're not part of
the inventory, are they?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.513
-No.
-Show us.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.552
Oh, my God.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.454
They're...
they're all gone.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.588
How much was in here?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.224
I don't know;
if I had to guess,

30:58.257 --> 31:00.026
50, 60,000 at the most.

31:02.128 --> 31:05.097
MEGAN: That's Rausch leaving
with the repaired jewelry.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.098
It's not even close

31:06.132 --> 31:07.099
to what he owes.

31:07.133 --> 31:07.833
Yeah, but he's
desperate, Don.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.235
He's going to do
anything he can

31:09.268 --> 31:11.103
if he thinks
it's going to save his family.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.040
You know,

31:14.073 --> 31:15.441
there's an entrance

31:15.474 --> 31:17.109
for the 101 south right there.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.311
Even if we know he headed south,
that's an half an hour ago.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.479
It's not going to help us much.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.081
Sure it is.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.021
This is PEMS:

31:29.055 --> 31:32.024
the Freeway Performance
Evaluation Monitoring System.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.526
Okay? Grad students at Cal-Sci
actually consulted on this.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.162
I ran the system.

31:36.195 --> 31:39.165
Caltrans has sensors
embedded in the roads.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.566
They count cars, trucks.

31:40.599 --> 31:44.036
They monitor traffic patterns,
and that information is sent

31:44.070 --> 31:47.974
to a UC Berkley computer
about twice a minute.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.276
PEMS is designed
to predict

31:50.309 --> 31:52.211
optimal traffic routes
and travel time,

31:52.244 --> 31:55.447
but here, it can give us an idea
of the speed and movement

31:55.481 --> 31:58.117
of traffic at the time
that Rausch got on the freeway.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.618
Projecting
from that information,

31:59.651 --> 32:01.453
as well as the time
elapsed...

32:01.487 --> 32:03.189
Oh, this is the part
of the S.A.T.s

32:03.222 --> 32:04.190
that kept me
out of Harvard.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.959
The train is leaving the station
at 5:00, right?

32:06.993 --> 32:09.061
I'm applying Constructal Theory:

32:09.095 --> 32:11.063
point-area
and point-volume flows.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.533
See, traffic moves
like any other fluid system.

32:14.566 --> 32:18.204
There are imperfections,
obstacles that force the system

32:18.237 --> 32:22.574
to optimize performance
by reducing its resistance...

32:22.608 --> 32:24.476
Now, Martin Rausch knows
this area pretty well,

32:24.510 --> 32:25.511
and if he's like

32:25.544 --> 32:27.446
any of the rest of us,
he'll reduce his resistance

32:27.479 --> 32:29.548
by choosing
the least congested route

32:29.581 --> 32:31.183
to arrive at his destination.

32:31.217 --> 32:34.286
Still not seeing how
you can tell us where he's at.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.387
I can't exactly.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.223
Well, at least not yet,
not right now.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.059
But what I can do...

32:40.092 --> 32:42.094
-You say this is the 101 south?
-Yes.

32:42.128 --> 32:46.032
What I can do
is give you a bounded area.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.571
Wait a minute.

32:52.604 --> 32:53.639
Isn't this the area
where Remy said

32:53.672 --> 32:56.608
he was supposed to make the drop
after the robbery?

32:56.642 --> 32:58.410
Yeah.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.778
DON:
Right.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.447
At this parking lot.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.385
Don, that's
Rausch's car.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.454
Yeah.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.457
This is Special Agent Don Eppes
with the FBI.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.560
I need LAPD to cordon off
a one block area

33:14.593 --> 33:17.329
running south from Temple,
north to Second Street.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.098
Copy that.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.436
I think he's still
in there.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.640
Mr. Rausch?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.176
What are you doing here?

33:30.209 --> 33:33.212
They didn't bring
my family back.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.281
Just step out of the car,
please.

33:36.615 --> 33:37.649
Who didn't bring them?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.118
I thought if I...

33:39.151 --> 33:41.120
if I at least
paid them something...

33:41.153 --> 33:43.255
But it wasn't enough.
They... they want more.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.590
And I haven't...
I haven't got any more.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.725
Did they show you proof
they have your family?

33:50.396 --> 33:52.698
It's different
from the jewelry store,

33:52.731 --> 33:55.167
different location.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.668
-I've lost them, haven't I?
-We don't know that, okay?

33:58.304 --> 33:59.638
DON:
They call you on this?

33:59.671 --> 34:01.140
Yes.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.276
This is all
my fault. I...

34:04.310 --> 34:05.277
It wasn't supposed

34:05.311 --> 34:06.345
to go like this.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.546
Hold...
what are you talking about?

34:07.579 --> 34:09.081
They were just supposed to be

34:09.115 --> 34:10.249
held for a couple of hours...

34:10.282 --> 34:12.251
driven around until
they got the diamonds,

34:12.284 --> 34:14.120
-then they said they'd let them
go. -Wait a minute.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.555
Are you saying that...
that you knew all about this?

34:16.588 --> 34:17.823
They were going
to kill me.

34:17.856 --> 34:18.824
You understand?

34:20.259 --> 34:21.327
This was a way out.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.462
It was a way out for all of us.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.575
Rausch is useless.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.577
He has no idea
where they are.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.146
I was actually starting

34:40.179 --> 34:42.248
to feel sorry
for the son of a bitch.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.582
Yeah, he played us something,
huh?

34:43.615 --> 34:45.384
Okay, I understand
the robbery.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.720
How do you involve your family
in a kidnapping?

34:48.754 --> 34:52.124
Well, it's just like you said,
so we'd feel sorry for him.

34:52.158 --> 34:52.891
It gives him
deniability.

34:52.924 --> 34:53.759
'Cause no one's
going to suspect

34:53.792 --> 34:56.495
a guy whose whole
family's missing.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.530
We just counted him
as another victim.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.299
Good news is, as of
about a half an hour ago,

35:00.332 --> 35:02.234
the mother and the kid
are still alive, so...

35:02.268 --> 35:03.802
How are you so sure?

35:03.835 --> 35:05.304
The picture was taken
at a different location.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.104
If they were going
to kill them,

35:06.138 --> 35:07.406
they wouldn't be
moving them around.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.440
Yeah, but now they know

35:08.474 --> 35:09.608
they've gotten everything

35:09.641 --> 35:11.410
they possibly can
out of Rausch.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.279
I mean, he even
tapped out

35:13.312 --> 35:15.481
his credit cards with the whole
gambling thing.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.515
Wait a minute.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.516
-That's it.
-That's what?

35:17.549 --> 35:18.684
The credit cards.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.752
Remy accepts credit cards
but he doesn't process them.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.953
He sends them through
to the Reynolds' Web site.

35:21.987 --> 35:24.423
Yeah, but we checked the Web
site and it was a dead end.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.291
Yeah, well,

35:25.324 --> 35:28.294
I'll believe that
when Charlie hits it.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.463
Hey, uh, thank you
for doing this.

35:31.497 --> 35:34.500
I hope it's not, um,
too uncomfortable for you.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.602
Amazingly enough, it isn't.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.775
Well, the FBI techs were right.

35:43.809 --> 35:44.943
The route ends

35:44.976 --> 35:46.212
at a server
in China.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.246
Yeah, but...

35:47.279 --> 35:49.281
I know, but they're not
in China.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.649
And they're not accessing
the Internet through China.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.817
That's their...
this is just a disguise.

35:51.850 --> 35:55.187
Disguise or not, Charlie,
that's where the trail ends.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.622
( sighs )

35:56.655 --> 35:58.357
All right, all right,
all right.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.425
Wait a minute.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.592
Just wait a minute.

36:00.626 --> 36:05.697
Um, every time someone
visits a Web site,

36:05.731 --> 36:07.299
they rewrite some
of the code, don't they?

36:07.333 --> 36:08.400
Yeah.

36:08.434 --> 36:09.635
Yeah.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.936
So, can't we trace that back

36:10.969 --> 36:12.471
to the computer
that created the site?

36:12.504 --> 36:15.241
Well, we have to have
some specific data stream

36:15.274 --> 36:17.243
to follow them.
I mean, there are hundreds,

36:17.276 --> 36:19.345
maybe thousands of visitors
to this site.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.613
But only the two men we're
looking for are setting odds.

36:21.647 --> 36:22.548
Still...

36:22.581 --> 36:24.416
I mean, we need some sort
of unique data

36:24.450 --> 36:26.552
to isolate them.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.194
Fractions.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.464
Specifically a Farey Sequence.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.898
Farey Sequence...

36:39.931 --> 36:40.766
Let's say we begin

36:40.799 --> 36:42.901
slicing oranges...
a lot of oranges.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.971
But the rule is
we can never repeat a cut.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.640
In other words, we cut
the first orange in half;

36:48.674 --> 36:50.609
the next orange,
we take out a third;

36:50.642 --> 36:54.313
the next, one-fourth;
then, one-fifth and so on.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.614
In the end,

36:55.647 --> 36:58.650
we're left with many orange
slices of varying size.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.886
When they're arranged
from smallest to largest,

37:00.919 --> 37:03.255
they form a Farey sequence.

37:03.289 --> 37:06.392
And yes, it's a fairly esoteric
pattern of fractions.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.927
However, the one place they
often tend to show up:

37:08.960 --> 37:10.362
bookmaking.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.564
And there's
our unique data stream.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.901
So, one-eighth is seven-to-one
odds, one-seventh

37:15.934 --> 37:18.870
is six-to-one and two-thirds
is two-to-one.

37:18.904 --> 37:19.871
Exactly.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.711
Right.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.446
So all the fractions
are betting lines.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.415
Right. And they led us
to an Internet account

37:29.448 --> 37:31.049
billed
to a marine repair business

37:31.082 --> 37:32.017
in San Pedro.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.553
Wait, you say San Pedro?
That's the same place

37:34.586 --> 37:36.688
the Reynolds' brothers
have their mail drop.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.524
FBI!

38:12.558 --> 38:13.492
FBI!

38:13.525 --> 38:15.527
FBI! Hands up!

38:15.561 --> 38:16.462
Get them up!

38:16.495 --> 38:17.095
Get those hands up!

38:17.128 --> 38:18.063
Don't move!

38:18.096 --> 38:19.931
You, get your hands up there!

38:21.400 --> 38:22.901
Where are they?
Where are they?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.069
I got no idea

38:24.102 --> 38:24.603
what you're
talking about!

38:27.373 --> 38:28.374
Neither does my brother.

38:31.009 --> 38:34.346
They're not here, Don.
No sign of them.

38:35.681 --> 38:36.748
Guys, I think
we may be too late.

38:36.782 --> 38:37.883
No, we're not.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.818
We're going to check the docks,
the boats, everything.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.420
Let's go.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.424
All right... Petey,

38:45.457 --> 38:47.058
up there.
Sam, Mikey,

38:47.092 --> 38:48.026
this way.

38:48.059 --> 38:48.794
You guys
come with me.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.631
Whoa... hold on.
Shhh.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.131
Quiet.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.500
Quiet.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.401
I hear it.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.068
Get me something
to pry this open with.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.070
My name is Don Eppes!

38:59.104 --> 39:00.071
I'm with the FBI.
Can you hear me?

39:00.105 --> 39:01.773
WOMAN:
Please, hurry.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.375
Just relax, ma'am.
We're coming right in.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.447
It's okay. It's over.
You all right?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.848
Anyone hurt? No?

39:09.881 --> 39:11.149
You all right,
sweetie?

39:11.182 --> 39:12.784
It's okay.
You're going home now.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.428
Daddy...

39:22.461 --> 39:23.695
It's okay, sweetie.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.431
-Everything's going to be all
right. -Oh, Martin, thank God.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.173
What...

39:35.206 --> 39:37.075
what's going on?

39:38.176 --> 39:41.146
You can tell them or I can.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.981
Tell me what?

39:43.014 --> 39:45.150
Martin?

39:45.183 --> 39:47.118
Julia, why don't we go
get some food

39:47.152 --> 39:49.387
and let Mommy and Daddy talk.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.118
The morose
and pensive expression

40:20.151 --> 40:22.153
of the romantically confounded.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.791
You know, it wasn't
like I was thrilled

40:25.824 --> 40:27.225
when our date bombed out,
you know,

40:27.258 --> 40:29.495
and I can accept the fact
that we're not compatible.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.463
You experiment,
it doesn't work,

40:31.497 --> 40:32.731
you move on.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.533
Yeah, a cornerstone
of scientific inquiry.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.200
Right, but...

40:35.233 --> 40:37.202
thing is is, like...

40:37.235 --> 40:38.804
when we're working
together,

40:38.837 --> 40:40.205
we talk and we laugh.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.908
And there's
an energy.

40:42.941 --> 40:47.513
And I don't understand why that
doesn't work outside the office.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.481
Why don't we have anything else
to talk about?

40:49.515 --> 40:52.751
You know, you're making
an underlying assumption here

40:52.784 --> 40:53.952
that I question.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.587
What's that?

40:55.621 --> 40:57.889
That there's something else
you have to talk about.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.091
See, where you see
two people

41:00.125 --> 41:02.494
unable to talk about politics
or movies...

41:02.528 --> 41:03.895
Hey, movies.

41:03.929 --> 41:04.996
I can...
I can talk about...

41:05.030 --> 41:06.932
I just saw the penguin movie.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.067
I see two extraordinary minds

41:09.100 --> 41:11.670
that can communicate
on the purest level

41:11.703 --> 41:14.039
a man and woman
can interface on.

41:15.574 --> 41:16.942
Okay, second purest.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.844
Geek love.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.078
Hey, no better kind.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.581
First one

41:22.614 --> 41:24.049
to ten points?

41:24.082 --> 41:26.051
Larry, man, I...
I play this game a lot.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.119
Hey, I'm no stranger
to the Student Union.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.021
Come on--
my physics versus your geometry.
