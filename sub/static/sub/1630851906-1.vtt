You have to understand, Master,
that funding a department

03:54.640 --> 03:57.400
with money from a company
with blood on its hands is...

03:59.160 --> 04:01.800
..with blood on its hands
can no longer be tolerated.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.240
Be wary of judging the past
by modern morals, Mr Sarson,

04:05.240 --> 04:10.720
lest your own enlightened virtues
one day fall from fashion.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.000
It's not about the past, Master.

04:25.600 --> 04:30.240
Oh! Good morning, Miss Widdowson.
Morning, Miss Newell.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.560
You're in early.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.600

06:02.600 --> 06:05.400
The deceased
is a Miss Margaret Widdowson.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.640
22, from Headington.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.080
Junior secretary
in the Master's office.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.560
She wouldn't have known anything
about it. Small mercies.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.080
And the, er, survivor?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.920
A Miss Newell.
Also secretarial.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.720
And where was the bomb?

06:24.720 --> 06:26.080
In the post, it looks like.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.520
A parcel, I should imagine,
by the size of the blast.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.680
Forensics will identify the package,
hopefully.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.840
What's left of it.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.760
But I expect it will be
a very lengthy process.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.880
Cause of death should speak
for itself, in this instance,

06:40.880 --> 06:43.760
But shall we say two o'clock?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.320
Thanks, Doctor.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.480
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.120
Very nice to have you back.
Doctor.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.840
So, what do we think?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.320
Angry Brigade?

06:54.320 --> 06:56.520
Word out of Barnet
is they charged a bloke Saturday

06:56.520 --> 06:58.880
with bombing
the Employment Minister's place.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.200
The Brigade would suggest that

07:00.200 --> 07:02.520
more than one person's involved,
wouldn't you think?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.920
Didn't they put something
in one of their communiques?

07:04.920 --> 07:06.760
"We attack properties, not people."

07:06.760 --> 07:09.040
Wouldn't be their style,
I shouldn't have thought.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.280
Well, whoever sent it
and whatever it came in,

07:12.280 --> 07:14.400
we can assume
it was meant for the Master.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.360
THURSDAY:
You've had no personal

07:18.360 --> 07:20.720
or professional disagreements
with colleagues?

07:20.720 --> 07:23.560
I had nothing to warrant such
a terrible, wicked...

07:24.600 --> 07:26.040
That poor, poor girl.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.560
I noticed some placards concerning
the Buchanan affair in the quad.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.960
Feelings are still running high,
I take it.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.720
Just undergraduate misbehaviour.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.000
What's this?
Tobias Buchanan, sir.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.520
He made a fortune in arms
during the American Civil War

07:40.520 --> 07:42.520
and later invested
a science chair here.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.360
Some say as a way to expiate
his sins.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.480
So, the issue is?
The company that bears his name

07:46.480 --> 07:49.280
also manufactures napalm
and a defoliant called Agent Orange,

07:49.280 --> 07:51.960
both of which have been used,
to lethal effect, in Vietnam.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.640
The more militantly minded
might see it as just cause.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.840
A bomb, though! What are you
thinking, that it's Angry Brigade?

07:57.840 --> 08:00.320
We're keeping an open mind.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.280
But to be on the safe side,
we'd like to put

08:02.280 --> 08:04.720
a uniformed constable
on the gate as a deterrent.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.880
Well, if you think so.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.440
Just for the time being.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.280
Until we get to the bottom
of things.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.800
Post delivered during
a postal strike.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.360
It's unlikely, don't you think?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.400
A lot of private firms
have taken up the slack.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.840
Well, I'll get on to anyone local,

08:18.840 --> 08:20.440
see if they've made deliveries
today.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.680
Strange can do that.
I'm quite capable.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.840
I'm not saying you're not.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.640
It's just there's something else
Mr Bright wants you to look at.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.840
Do you know much about football?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.360
Yes, sir.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.680
Understood.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.000
Just a moment, sir.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.040
Mr Bright said to let you know
he's running late at Division.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.720
But, er... Miss Frazil's here.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.000
He, er, put her in your office.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.800
Miss Frazil.
Chief Inspector. Morse.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.160
Bad moment?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.760
It never rains.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.080
Well, anything I can do
to help the boys in blue.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.520
But I've got to tell you,
sitting on a scoop this big

08:55.520 --> 08:57.040
goes against every instinct.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.960
As you can see, we've kept it
out of the paper for now.

08:59.960 --> 09:04.080
But if the threat is on the level,
and God forbid they make good on it,

09:04.080 --> 09:06.760
then it's gonna be all over the
front page, let alone the back.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.880
What's this?
There was an anonymous phone call

09:08.880 --> 09:11.120
to the Oxford Mail
on Saturday evening, was it?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.240
Man's voice. Irish.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.320
Said, "This is a message
from the Provisional IRA.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.400
"If Jack Swift plays in the game
on Wednesday against Cowley,

09:19.400 --> 09:20.840
"he'll be shot."

09:20.840 --> 09:23.520
Old or young, from the voice?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.880
Somewhere between 18 and 80.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.360
Ulster accent, like Paisley.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.920
Have you found out
where the call was made?

09:29.920 --> 09:33.080
It was a public phone
in the foyer of the Plaza Hotel.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.640
Well, that could just be a crank,
then, couldn't it?

09:36.640 --> 09:39.000
Someone who doesn't want Swift
playing against, er...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.160
Cowley Town, cup tie replay.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.520
The Plaza Hotel's a stone's throw
from Cowley's ground.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.960
It could've been someone
on the way back from the match.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.680
There was an issue when he first
joined the club, wasn't there?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.400
Hate mail, death threats.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.960
Well, we certainly got letters
saying people like Swift

09:53.960 --> 09:56.320
shouldn't be playing
for an English club.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.800
People like Swift?
Why, don't Irish footballers...

09:58.800 --> 10:01.520
play for English sides? Sorry,
I don't know much about the game.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.760
There are many Northern Irish
players in the English league.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.040
But as one correspondent put it,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.800
"None with the touch
of the tar brush".

10:11.040 --> 10:12.240
Ah...

10:12.240 --> 10:14.200
It's a race issue, then.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.360
When he first started, maybe.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.760
But Swift's long since
proved himself to the fans.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.120
I mean, he won them promotion
from the Second Division

10:21.120 --> 10:24.040
more or less single-handed.
Could there be any connection

10:24.040 --> 10:27.280
with the threat against Swift
and this bomb at Lonsdale?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.520
The Irish,
on this side of the water?

10:29.520 --> 10:32.440
I don't think they'd make a play
as bold as that, Miss Frazil.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.520
Well, what's threatening the life
of a leading footballer?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.120
Seems pretty bold to me,
Chief Inspector.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.360
Well, that's assuming that
the threat is genuine.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.680
Aren't you?

10:42.680 --> 10:45.040
Well, I think that's rather
the conundrum, don't you?

10:47.800 --> 10:51.720
Jack Swift is to have
round-the-clock local protection

10:51.720 --> 10:54.200
until the match is over.
Division's order.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.960
Football's hardly my area
of expertise, sir.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.880
I've very little interest
in the game.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.520
Which is exactly
why you've been chosen.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.560
The last thing we need
is someone with stars in their eyes

11:04.560 --> 11:07.960
who's going to be overwhelmed
by the whole soccer razzamatazz.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.200
Better by far to have someone
in place

11:10.200 --> 11:13.240
who's going to keep their eye
on the ball.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.680
As it were.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
You're all right, are you?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.840
Well, it's a case of having to be,
isn't it?

11:20.840 --> 11:23.160
I just think my time
will be better spent on the bomb,

11:23.160 --> 11:26.040
rather than playing wet nurse
to some overpaid football star.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.840
"Our is not to reason why."
And look how that turned out.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.160
If it's a real threat...

11:30.160 --> 11:31.920
But that's the point, isn't it?
"If".

11:31.920 --> 11:33.920
I just don't want to be on
a dead-end assignment

11:33.920 --> 11:35.400
when I could be helping you find

11:35.400 --> 11:37.160
which lunatic blew up
my old college.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.160
But Division knows best.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.440
WHISTLE TOOTS

11:44.440 --> 11:47.440
Right, simple passing drill, boys.
Give and go.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.360
Don't let Jack do all the work,
come on!

11:49.360 --> 11:52.160
Hey, work harder than that.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.240
Last one.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.520
WHISTLE TOOTS

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
'Ah, come on.'

11:56.800 --> 11:58.960
We're not taking any notice of that,
are we?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.600
It's just some wee buck eejit

12:00.600 --> 12:02.240
trying to put me off my game,
is all.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.160
Well, I'm sure there's nothing
to it, Mr Swift.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.000
But I am under strict instructions
to make sure that it stays that way.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.600
How's that? Kind of like
a bodyguard, do you mean?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.840
Well, something like that.
Either myself

12:11.840 --> 12:14.600
or one of my colleagues
will be with you at all times.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.320
Do I have a say?
No.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.800
You don't. It's come down
from Mr Fenner himself.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.240
He's not taking a gamble with
his star striker, is he, Jack?

12:22.240 --> 12:25.120
Well, I'm just about to see him.
What's that?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.760
I've a fitting for some clobber
for this fashion thing tonight.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.200
I'll talk to him, Dan.
I'm not afraid of these people.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.720
Nobody's thinking that.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.280
Not for a minute. We just...

12:34.280 --> 12:36.760
want to be sensible, that's all.
Mm.

12:36.760 --> 12:40.320
Is there no way that Mr Swift
can just miss the match?

12:40.320 --> 12:41.760
HE SCOFFS

12:42.720 --> 12:44.640
It's a cup tie.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.880
Do you know what that means
for the club financially?

12:47.880 --> 12:50.360
Besides, if I don't play this game,
what about the next?

12:50.360 --> 12:51.720
When does it stop?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.920
Your son's posted there, isn't he?

12:57.080 --> 12:59.000
Northern Ireland?
Yes, sir. Yes, he is.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.640
Getting on all right?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.400
Hard to tell with, Sam, sir.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.080
He writes home to his mother
once a week. But, er...

13:05.080 --> 13:06.600
with the postal strike.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.720
And Morse... how's he these days?

13:09.720 --> 13:11.400
Morse is Morse, sir.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.080
You know more than anyone
what last year took out of a soul.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.880
He walks a step slower maybe.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.160
Lost some of his bounce, you mean?

13:20.160 --> 13:23.360
A bit less full of himself.
A bit less cocksure.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.560
That's not always a bad thing.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.200
A bit of uncertainty,
a bit of doubt makes a man

13:28.200 --> 13:30.680
more careful in his work.
More thorough.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.720
Perhaps time does that to all of us,
sooner or later.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.040
There are some blows
from which one never quite recovers.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.440
Not fully, at least.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.280
One thing's for sure.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.360
He's no more the kid that got off
the coach from Carshall New Town.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.800
So, you've not noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.320
Nobody following you.
Outside of the press?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.280
No.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.160
I mean, nothing like that.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.000
Like what, then?
Look, it's daft.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.720
Last week, Thursday or Friday maybe,

14:03.720 --> 14:05.920
I was in a taxi coming through town,

14:05.920 --> 14:08.520
and I thought I saw someone I knew.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.400
From home.
Who?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.680
A fella I used to play football with
when we were kids.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.920
George Sellars.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.080
He married our neighbour's girl.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.480
Only, I was caught in the one-way,
right,

14:20.480 --> 14:24.040
and I had the driver go around,
but by the time we'd got back,

14:24.040 --> 14:25.360
there was no sign.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.800
But do you think it was him?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.720
Aye, he had the look of George,
sure.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.720
But I can't think he'd be in town
and not call.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.280
It's probably my mistake.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.800
But you said
anything out of the ordinary.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.680
I just had a chat with the Forensics
boys.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.840
They think the bomb
was inside a plain cardboard box

15:16.840 --> 15:19.720
wrapped in brown paper and string
on a timer.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.720
No distinguishing features.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.480
Well, that narrows it down a bit.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.480
I've spoken to all the major private
services delivering mail in Oxford.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.120
From Friday until today

15:29.120 --> 15:31.920
none of them had any parcels like
that for the college.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.040
The bomber must have dropped it off
himself, then.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.760
Anything from intelligence
on the usual two-bob radicals?

15:37.760 --> 15:39.040
This is Oxford.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.080
Roll a ball down Carfax,
you'll hit half-a-dozen agitators.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.200
Ban the bomb. Make love, not war.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.760
AmnOx. Vegetarians.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.200
They might make a noise,

15:48.200 --> 15:51.080
but I can't see any of that lot
blowing people up.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.760
Back to the Angry Brigade, then?
Else it's something personal.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.160
Come on, get your coat.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.440
HE TURNS THE ENGINE OFF

16:19.160 --> 16:22.840
Cecily, get Solly to cut a new
pattern for a different model.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.120
I just found out Suki's
in the pudding club.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.840
Marta, darling, you make sure
you put a bit more into it tonight.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.200
This isn't any old schmutter,

16:30.200 --> 16:32.960
this is the Robert Fenner Spring
Collection. That's it!

16:32.960 --> 16:34.680
Jackie!

16:34.680 --> 16:36.400
Take five, girls. Take five.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.240
Jackie, darling, all right?

16:38.240 --> 16:40.200
Who's your friend?
Police.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.800
Oh. Er, Robert Fenner.
Fenner Fashions.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.080
Couturier to the stars
and them that'd like to be.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.400
I also happen to be
Chairman of Oxford Wanderers.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.160
So I understand.

16:50.160 --> 16:54.440
Mr Swift tells me he is to attend
some, er... fashion show tonight.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.360
Tonight's the launch
of Fenner Fashions.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.800
Very important Jackie's here.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.160
More important he doesn't get
killed, don't you think?

17:00.160 --> 17:02.520
Now, I'll need a list
of all that are attending.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.520
Nobody's going to do anything to him
in public, are they?

17:05.520 --> 17:06.880
My good lady wife.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.280
Nothing's going to happen to him
with you here, is it?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.640
Tell you what, Cecily,

17:11.640 --> 17:14.400
why don't you take Jackie
to try his outfit for tonight on?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.320
Any alterations,
Solly can take care of. Of course.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.440
If you'd like to come this way,
Jackie.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.280
Let's take a look at that famous
inside leg, shall we?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.200
Aye, but I can't be
too long about it.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.760
Ray wants me back at the ground
for a photoshoot.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.720
I had a doctor's appointment
at 4:30 on Friday,

17:35.720 --> 17:39.080
so I came in a little earlier
this morning to make up the time.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.920
Maggie was already in.
She had the kettle on.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.800
Morning, Miss Newell.
You're in early.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.480
I noticed she had a parcel
wrapped in brown paper.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.560
Did you see who it was addressed to?

17:49.560 --> 17:51.360
I noticed it was for the Master.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.640
Only, they'd written Stanfield,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.760
rather than Stamfield.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.080
THURSDAY: 'Stanfield? With an N?'

17:58.080 --> 18:00.920
'Yes. GW Stanfield.'

18:00.920 --> 18:03.600
I turned away to do something
and there was a bright light.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.040
That's all I remember.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.880
Was everything well between you?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.280
Oh, yes.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.400
We got on like a house on fire.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.760
How about Professor Stamfield,
with his colleagues and so forth?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.640
No fall-outs there or...?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.120
He had words with Maggie
about her timekeeping.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.400
Sometimes she'd only put her nose
around the door

18:24.400 --> 18:26.400
at a quarter or 20 past nine.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.680
It seems silly now...

18:31.160 --> 18:32.600
..the things we fret over.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.000
Something like this happens and...

18:36.600 --> 18:38.160
..you wonder why you worry.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.520
Miss Widdowson has a sister,
a Mrs Frida O'Rourke.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.120
I wonder if she knows something.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.240
See if you can run her down,
find out what's what.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.320
And meet me back at the ranch.
Sir.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.600
Despite playing for opposing teams,

18:55.600 --> 18:58.880
both Jack Swift
and John-Paul Martinelli

18:58.880 --> 19:02.200
are delighted to be associated
with the launch of...

19:02.200 --> 19:04.760
the Striker from Grenville Cycles.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.920
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS
So, any questions?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.040
Yes, I've a question
for Mr Martinelli.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.920
How does it feel to be described
as "the next Jack Swift"?

19:14.600 --> 19:17.080
Oh, there's only one Jack Swift.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.320
He's been my hero
since I was at school.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.560
And now you're up against him
on Wednesday.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.200
Any predictions?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.600
Wanderers will have the home
advantage here at The Field.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.560
But Cowley's ready to give it
all we've got.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.320
You know, that's the magic
of a cup tie.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.880
Anything can happen.

19:32.320 --> 19:33.480
All right, folks.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.880
The boys have got to get back
to their training, so...

19:35.880 --> 19:37.840
Well, thank you very much.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.800
Come on, then, lads.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.760
You drew the short straw, then.
Urgh...

19:45.760 --> 19:47.720
So, what's the plan with Swift?

19:47.720 --> 19:51.000
Well, keep him alive, I suppose.
If the threat's genuine.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.360
Are you all right?
You look a bit peaky.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.240
Oh, I'm fine.
Sure?

19:55.240 --> 19:56.360
Yeah.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.920
Do you know him, Swift?

19:59.920 --> 20:02.920
Yeah, I've interviewed him once
or twice. He seems nice enough.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.760
Which isn't something you can say
for Ray Jubba, their agent.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.040
Their agent?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.960
Yeah, Swift
and John-Paul Martinelli.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.600
Ray Jubba manages them both.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.880
But they play for different sides.
Not for much longer.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.240
Word is, Martinelli's looking
to transfer from Cowley,

20:18.240 --> 20:20.320
and Wanderers are interested.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.880
"The next Jack Swift"?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.160
But the Wanderers have already got
a Jack Swift.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.400
Why do they need another?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.400
"And slowly answered Arthur
from the barge,

20:28.400 --> 20:32.240
"'The old order changeth,
yielding place to new.'"

20:33.680 --> 20:36.720
Every god has his day, Morse.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.080
I'd better go.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.920
Don't you think you should tell him?

20:56.920 --> 20:59.000
I thought he might take it better
coming from you.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.240
You're the manager, Dan.
I'm just his agent.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.200
It's what they pay you for.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.640
Just let him get the game
tomorrow night out of the way.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.320
And you're keeping in touch
with your family back home now.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.760
Cos... that's important
when you're over here.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.400
Oh, sure.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.720
Duke Ward said to send his best,
by the way.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.600
When did you see Duke?
I didn't.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.000
I spoke to him.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.080
You know, on the phone.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.800
OK.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.040
Well...

21:31.040 --> 21:34.240
if you've any problems,
you just let me know.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.040
All right?
Sure thing.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.640
I'll see you tonight.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.600
I mean, tomorrow at the game.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.640
Here, you couldn't get me
that Cheryl's number, could you?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.680
Fancy her, do you?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.480
I can introduce you.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.800
But some things
a man's got to do himself, 'ey?

22:02.640 --> 22:05.640
It's OK. This is Jim.
He's a policeman.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.000
Aye-aye, Joanie.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.560
Back on the horse, then?

22:10.560 --> 22:13.400
Dad said you had a time of it.
Oh, did he?

22:14.480 --> 22:16.400
What's the story here?

22:16.400 --> 22:18.760
Just something I got involved with
through Welfare.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.040
I'm looking for Frida O'Rourke.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.120
Uniform thought
she might've come here.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.960
Is she one of yours?
What's it about?

22:26.960 --> 22:28.560
A family matter.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.240
Her sister's been killed.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.560
Maggie?
You know her?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.120
Yeah, I know her.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.200
She visited Frida
a couple of times.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.440
What happened, an accident, or...?

22:39.440 --> 22:41.280
Not exactly.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.760
Oi!
Hope you're looking after my boy.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.880
He means a lot to me.
I'd hate to see anything happen.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.720
You manage them both, I understand.
Their commercial interests,

22:49.720 --> 22:52.320
endorsements, personal appearances,
that sort of thing.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.480
Is it lucrative?
Put it this way...

22:56.560 --> 22:59.200
..when Jack lent his name
to a range of signature boots,

22:59.200 --> 23:01.800
they sold more than half a million
in the first season alone.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.880
59 and 11 a pair for the boys.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.760
149 shillings for men's.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.800
Decent screw in any money,
old or new.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.680
Joan said she'd been by to see you.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.000
Last week.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.000
She just came by to drop
some bits off for the kiddies.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.640
When I left their dad,
I had to go quick,

23:24.640 --> 23:27.120
and their toys got left behind.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.120
How was she?

23:30.120 --> 23:32.640
Did she seem all right?
Nothing bothering her? No troubles?

23:32.640 --> 23:35.520
I was going to be maid of honour
and she...

23:38.360 --> 23:40.880
I'm sorry.
It's OK. You're all right.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.560
Poor Maggie!

24:31.360 --> 24:33.160
I don't suppose you can get me out

24:33.160 --> 24:35.400
of this thing tonight with Fenner,
can you?

24:35.400 --> 24:36.800
Sorry, Jackie, no can do.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.640
It's, you know, all set up
and we've got the papers there.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.720
Sure, Ray. Sure.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.400
Right, can you, er, just look after
him? I've got to make a phone call.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.480
He's all right, really.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.240
He's got my best interests at heart.
Fashion shows?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.200
Photoshoots? Endorsements?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.720
It's a wonder you get time
to play any football at all.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.880
Who's that?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.520
No idea.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.080
He's not ground staff.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.600
Press maybe?

25:06.040 --> 25:08.880
If her old man shows up,
you know where I am.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.360
And if anything ever comes to her
her sister might've said.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.520
Of course.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.920
Well, then.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.360
Mind how you go.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.280
Oh, here...

25:24.600 --> 25:26.320
I've got a do coming up.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.480
A ladies' do, in the spring.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.680
A charity evening.
Dinner dance.

25:30.680 --> 25:31.920
I was wondering...

25:32.960 --> 25:34.640
..I don't suppose it'd be up
your street?

25:34.640 --> 25:36.000
SHE CHUCKLES

25:36.000 --> 25:39.880
Somebody let you down?
No. No, no, no, nothing like that.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.040
You're the first person I've asked.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.360
I'll believe you.
No, honest.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.320
We're expected to bring someone.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.560
"James Strange and guest."

25:50.560 --> 25:52.840
What about your girlfriend?

25:53.840 --> 25:55.400
I'm between at the minute.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.240
You'd be doing me a favour.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.920
And it's all for a good cause.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.600
What time?
Seven for drinks and canopies.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.360
Sit down's at eight. Pick you up
and drop you back, of course.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.000
Nice, private hire car.
Home by midnight.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.200
SHE LAUGHS

26:12.200 --> 26:14.000
Before I turn into a pumpkin?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.040
HE LAUGHS

26:16.040 --> 26:17.680
All right, go on, then.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.640
Really?

26:20.640 --> 26:22.320
Oh, right.

26:24.560 --> 26:28.960
I'll phone you through with
the date. It's not until May, but...

26:28.960 --> 26:30.400
Ta.

Don't worry.
I'll get him at the end of the show.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.920
Well, I've a list of guests

No, "I'll get him at the end

talking about?

'They don't even know
if he's gonna play in the match.

Mr Goldenboots himself,

28:40.360 --> 28:42.640
up on to the stage for a few photos.

Come on, Jackie, don't be shy.

That's right.
Straight down there.

Hello. How are you?

29:03.760 --> 29:06.720
Jack, sorry to interrupt
such a great show,

29:06.720 --> 29:08.760
but we have another show
for you as well.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.560
Because tonight, Jack Swift,
Oxford Wanderers

29:11.560 --> 29:13.920
and Northern Ireland

29:35.120 --> 29:37.520
So, Jack, this is your life.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.240
Eamonn Andrews! Well,
I don't really watch television.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.040
But you must have heard of him!
Well...

29:43.040 --> 29:45.080
No harm done.
Better safe than sorry.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.000
Though, I expect you'll get it
from uniform

29:47.000 --> 29:48.640
when you get back to the nick.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.800
Aye-aye.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.720
What's the latest
on the bombing at Lonsdale?

29:51.720 --> 29:53.920
Outside of the Angry Brigade,
we're coming up short

29:53.920 --> 29:56.640
on whether anybody has much
against Stamfield or the college.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.760
Well, what about the victim?
Blameless.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.960
She has a sister whose husband
knocks her about a bit.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.760
But other than that,
the family seems decent.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.680
Her fiance's broken-hearted over it.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.400
'..has a special message
for you now.'

30:07.400 --> 30:08.800
Hello, Jack.
Sarah.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.600
I remember when
you were practising your football

30:11.600 --> 30:15.160
and you looked up and saw me
and gave me that cheeky grin.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.200
But even with all the good luck
you've had, you're still the same...

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
And her colleague?
Miss Newell didn't have much to say.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.960
Stamfield had had a bit of a go
at the girl over her timekeeping.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.000
But otherwise, all was hunky-dory.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.120
So, have a wonderful night
with your family and friends.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.800
And I hope to see you soon.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.360
And she'll be seeing you sooner
than you both thought.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.000
You last saw her eight years ago

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
when you were her husband's
best man.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.520
But she's here tonight.
Sarah Coyle then.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.000
Now, Sarah Sellars!

30:42.000 --> 30:45.080
APPLAUSE

30:46.360 --> 30:48.000
Yes, as Sarah said,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.200
you were never that keen
on school work.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.000
And as our next witness
will testify,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.200
your eagerness to play football
often got you into trouble.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.000
MAN: It was only a kick-about
after school.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.560
But when he got home,
Jack was really in hot water.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.960
Yes, you've not seen him
for a while, your school pal

31:02.960 --> 31:05.360
and fellow footballing hopeful
from Londonderry,

31:05.360 --> 31:08.440
you were best man at his wedding,
George Sellars!

31:12.800 --> 31:15.520
So, tell us, George, what sort of
trouble did Jack used to get in?

31:15.520 --> 31:18.160
Well, down the rec,
we didn't have a proper goal,

31:18.160 --> 31:20.160
so we'd use our jumpers
to mark the posts, like.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.480
This one game, he gets his jumper
absolutely wrecked.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.440
He knew he'd catch it off his mam,
so he borrowed mine.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.240
Did the deception work, Mrs Swift?
No, Eamonn, it didn't!

31:30.240 --> 31:31.680
LAUGHTER

31:31.680 --> 31:34.840
It wasn't Jackie's name tag that was
sewn into the collar of his sweater,

31:34.840 --> 31:38.240
it was George's, so I knew
they'd been out and up to no good.

31:38.240 --> 31:42.040
I said to him, "You'll get a clatter
off your daddy when he gets home!"

31:42.040 --> 31:43.240
Rest his soul.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.320
Thank you, George Sellars!

31:45.320 --> 31:46.760
APPLAUSE

31:46.760 --> 31:49.040
And before long,
your name reached the ears

31:49.040 --> 31:52.040
of someone who was to change
the course of your life.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.840
A docker friend of your late father
who, in his spare time,

31:54.840 --> 31:57.480
acted as part-time coach
and talent scout

31:57.480 --> 31:59.920
for football clubs here in England.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.720
Duke Ward.
Yes.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.400
That's right, it's the man who
spotted all that young potential,

32:04.400 --> 32:08.680
a legendary football scout in
Northern Ireland, Marmaduke Ward!

32:08.680 --> 32:11.320
APPLAUSE

32:13.120 --> 32:14.760
Good to see you, Jackie.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.280
Duke, tell me, what was your
reaction when you first saw Jack?

32:17.280 --> 32:20.880
Well, Eamonn, to tell you the truth,
it was terrible.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.200
Five feet, four,
and less meat on him than a whippet.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.440
But I knew,
the moment I saw this fella,

32:25.440 --> 32:28.080
that he could be something
very, very special

32:28.080 --> 32:30.080
if he put the hard work in

32:30.080 --> 32:31.920
and had somebody
to take him in hand.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.440
We got him up to the mark,

32:33.440 --> 32:34.680
and then I had no hesitation

32:34.680 --> 32:36.440
in recommending him
to the Wanderers.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.680
And I think you'll agree,
he hasn't done too bad so far.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.040
Indeed, he hasn't.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.080
Thank you, Duke Ward.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.040
APPLAUSE

32:45.600 --> 32:47.920
Now, to close tonight,
we have someone else

32:47.920 --> 32:50.000
who's here to pay tribute to you.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.520
A young man to whom
you were a schoolboy hero,

32:52.520 --> 32:56.000
and who may himself
be facing the kind of adulation

32:56.000 --> 32:57.640
you've gotten used to.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.680
That's right, Eamonn.
But there's only one Jack Swift.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.200
Yes, that's right.
It's the young striker

33:03.200 --> 33:05.800
who's being hailed as
"the next Jack Swift".

33:05.800 --> 33:07.360
Cowley Town centre-forward

33:07.360 --> 33:11.560
and Northern Ireland international,
John-Paul Martinelli!

33:11.560 --> 33:13.280
APPLAUSE

33:15.640 --> 33:17.440
I saw him this morning
and he never let on.

33:17.440 --> 33:21.080
So, John-Paul, what is it
you'd like to say to Jack?

33:21.080 --> 33:24.240
Jack, you've been a hero,
not just to me,

33:24.240 --> 33:26.480
but to thousands
of other schoolboys.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.000
And I know everyone back home

33:28.000 --> 33:30.160
and here in the UK
is just so proud of you,

33:30.160 --> 33:32.560
and what you've achieved
in your career.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.520
Well, hopefully, it's not over yet!

33:36.520 --> 33:38.080
LAUGHTER
Indeed not.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.800
But for now, at least, Jack Swift,
this is your life.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.320
THEME MUSIC,
APPLAUSE

33:49.600 --> 33:51.160

33:51.160 --> 33:53.720
My playing days
are mostly behind me.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.080
Oh, look, here he is.
It's Duke.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.120
The unluckiest man in showbusiness.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.160
Now, what was it you made
for discovering Jack?

34:00.160 --> 34:02.160
15 quid finder's fee, wasn't it?

34:02.160 --> 34:05.080
On top of the £2.10 a week retainer,
of course. No.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.160
No, you should come and work for me.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.680
Well, for some of us,
it's not about the money.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.840
But then, I wouldn't expect a man
like you

34:11.840 --> 34:13.400
to know anything about that.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.200
What man like me?
A parasite.

34:16.200 --> 34:18.800
Where were you on the freezing,
cold winter mornings

34:18.800 --> 34:20.640
I had him out training?

34:20.640 --> 34:22.240
Nowhere.
That's where you were.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.320
And yet,
you've bled Jack near enough dry.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.600
And now you've got your claws
into John-Paul.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.920
So, you're all set to ruin him, too.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
You're a grasper.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.880
You make me sick to my stomach.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.280
Hm...

34:38.280 --> 34:40.040
All that stamina.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.680
I think that when you come
and play for the Wanderers

34:42.680 --> 34:45.760
that we're going to be
very good friends.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.200
Oh, it's you.

34:48.200 --> 34:51.240
Be a darling and go and fetch me
a little drinkie.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.680
I'm a detective sergeant
at Thames Valley, Mrs Fenner.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.080
I'm not a wine waiter.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.280
I'm sure your husband
can freshen your glass.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.160
Er, vodka martini, wasn't it,
Mrs Fenner?

34:59.160 --> 35:01.440
Cecily. Please.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.560
No mistaking you for Cupid,
is there?

35:09.960 --> 35:12.600
Sweetheart...
You might have mentioned this.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.360
Oh, well, we were all sworn
to secrecy, weren't we?

35:15.360 --> 35:16.680
But you knew it was gonna happen

35:16.680 --> 35:18.400
when there was a threat
against his life.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.840
Er, what can I say?
I don't know what this

35:21.840 --> 35:24.160
threat business is about
any more than you do.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.120
I'm grateful you're looking out
for him.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.000
But by this time tomorrow,
it'll all be over.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.200
Well, no,
the threat was if he played.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.000
He hasn't played yet.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.960
ROBERT CLEARS HIS THROAT

35:43.080 --> 35:44.680
Mr Lofthouse...

35:44.680 --> 35:47.000
The Doncaster Dynamo.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.640
I saw you play against Millwall
in, er, '54, was it? A cup tie.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.240
I used to take my boy Sam there
when he was smaller.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.400
Before we moved to Oxford,
of course.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.360
Come on, let's split.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.800
But what about your family?
It's...

36:00.800 --> 36:02.360
It's your party.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.240
They're not here for me.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.880
Right, OK.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.480
Hey, Jack, can I get you a drink?

36:08.480 --> 36:10.520
Not right at the minute, Georgie.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.720
Are you sure?
Cos I know Sarah'd love to catch up.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.880
She must've just nipped out
to powder her nose.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.480
She'll be back in a minute,
I'm sure.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.040
I can't have a late night, George.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.800
I've got a match tomorrow.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.920
Are you staying on for it?
Yeah, of course.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.600
We're all put up at the Plaza.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.360
Your mum and sisters and everyone.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.880
Great.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.200
Great, we'll do something after,
then. OK?

36:34.120 --> 36:35.680
Home!

36:35.680 --> 36:37.600
WIN: You're late, Dad!

36:37.600 --> 36:39.480
Work went on.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.560
You missed Sam on the telephone.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.320
I gave him your best.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.240
All right over there, is it...

36:49.360 --> 36:50.800
..with the locals?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.280
Behaving themselves?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.160
He didn't say.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.720
I asked if he was looking
after himself. He said he was.

36:59.120 --> 37:02.040
I'll put the kettle on.
Nothing for me this late.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.600
Fair dos. Here...

37:04.600 --> 37:06.640
you'll never guess
who I met tonight.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.440
Who? Someone we know?

37:08.440 --> 37:10.000
Eamonn Andrews.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.600
Eamonn Andrews?

37:11.600 --> 37:13.840
Fancy!

37:13.840 --> 37:15.360
What's he like?

37:15.360 --> 37:16.640
Very nice.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.000
But not as tall as he looks
on the telly.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.520
Sorry to drag you away.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.760
I just had to get out.

37:25.760 --> 37:28.200
You know, get away.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.600
Sometimes, it takes me like that.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.520
I get tired of it.
Of what?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.400
Being Jack Swift.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.320
What, the adulation, women, money?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.240
My commiserations!
Aye.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.960
It looks great from the outside.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.640
But everyone wants something.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.160
A signed photo.
A cut of your wages.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.360
To be your friend.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.000
To take them to bed so they can run
to the papers about it.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.640
And what do you want?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.600
The love of a good woman.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.000
I had one, too.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.480
And I let her go.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.920
It was put to me I had to choose.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.240
It was her...

38:08.200 --> 38:10.200
..or success at the football.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.320
There's not a day goes by...

38:12.320 --> 38:13.520
HE CHUCKLES

38:13.520 --> 38:15.480
And now they want to kill me for it.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.240
Have you got a girl?

38:23.720 --> 38:26.120
Er, no. No, not at the moment.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.320
I could get some company over.
Make a call.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.680
Well, erm, I mean, I'm on duty.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.960
And, er...

38:36.960 --> 38:40.160
And you've got a big game tomorrow.
You should probably get some rest.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.880
To those about to die.
Well, hopefully not!

38:42.880 --> 38:44.240
HE CHUCKLES

38:44.240 --> 38:45.960
No, no, I'll, er...

38:45.960 --> 38:48.520
I'll just stick to the crossword.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.760
Yeah.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.840
Get your clothes on and get out,
you little bitch!

39:08.920 --> 39:11.480
How dare you! I'll kill you!

39:11.480 --> 39:14.080
You said it was over!
You walked out! You left!

39:14.080 --> 39:15.960
I thought you'd come after me.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.040
Instead, I spend three weeks

39:18.040 --> 39:19.600
bored out of my
mind at the George V.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.840
DOORBELL CHIMES
Which you're paying for!

39:21.840 --> 39:23.280
I'm paying for?

39:23.280 --> 39:25.440
And now I come back
to find the place

39:25.440 --> 39:28.760
filled with your stupid,
bloody tarts!

39:29.800 --> 39:31.280
Don't walk away from me!

39:31.280 --> 39:33.600
Yes?
Morse. I'm your relief.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.120
Bill Shaw, Special Branch.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.600
You'd better get home, get some kip.
You must be beat.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.120
MORSE GROANS
Is, er...?

39:41.120 --> 39:43.600
Is that his piece, is it,
the blondie one?

39:44.920 --> 39:48.360
Yeah, apparently.
Nice work if you can get it.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.040
And if anyone can get it, he can.

39:50.040 --> 39:54.040
You won't have seen the paper.
It's all over.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.480
If there was no threat to him
before, a headline like that

39:56.480 --> 39:58.560
will drag every lunatic
out of the woodwork.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.240
And take your bloody rubbish
with you!

40:00.240 --> 40:02.240
Let the girl get her knickers on.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.480
Jesus...

40:03.480 --> 40:05.560
Sorry, love.
First time for everything, hey?

40:05.560 --> 40:07.640
Detective Sergeant Bill Shaw,
Special Branch.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.960
He'll be looking after you
this afternoon.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.440
I'll be back this evening.

40:12.440 --> 40:15.120
"The love of a good woman..."
When did she arrive?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.240
First thing.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.840
I did get an early night,
like you said, but...

40:21.880 --> 40:23.600
Well...

40:23.600 --> 40:25.280
breakfast of champions.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.920
STAMFIELD: I have already addressed
the concerns

40:33.920 --> 40:35.680
of John Sarson with him directly.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.880
And as far as the college
is concerned...

40:40.880 --> 40:43.400
..no further action need be taken.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.000
My apologies.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.880
I'm afraid, if I don't follow
my train of thought to its terminus,

40:47.880 --> 40:49.760
I find it difficult to pick up
the thread.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.240
What can I do for you?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.480
We've spoken to Miss Newell
at the hospital yesterday.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.320
She's recovering, I trust?

40:56.320 --> 40:57.680
Seems to be.

40:57.680 --> 41:02.240
She says you and Miss Widdowson
had words about her timekeeping.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.320
I had to take her to task.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.080
But it wasn't about her timekeeping.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.400
Rather, her poor
and haphazard filing.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.280
To be honest, her spelling
was not all one might wish.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.080
But, really, that was nothing.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.720
Not nothing to the girl.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.240
She was in tears, apparently.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.080
I perfectly accept I can be
a little brusque.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.960
But, truly, I'm not in the habit
of reducing my staff to tears.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.200
Whatever upset her that afternoon...

41:28.160 --> 41:29.520
..it wasn't me.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.960
STRANGE: Aye-aye, matey.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.960
What's the latest?
We had another go at the Master.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.800
And another word with his colleagues

41:54.800 --> 41:57.040
to see if anyone might want
to blow him to kingdom come.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.840
Not an enemy in the world,
apparently.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.960
The Master of an Oxford college
without an enemy?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.600
That would be a miracle.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.200
And what about the bomb?
Regular cardboard box.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.480
Wrapped in brown paper.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.200
Tied with string.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.800
Handwritten address.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.600
Well, what's left of it.
Meant for Stamfield.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.720
Looks to have been a time bomb,
according to the Forensics boys.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.920
Dynamite wired up to an alarm clock.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.240
Simple, but effective.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.320
And is that consistent with
the Angry Brigade's other devices?

42:22.320 --> 42:24.720
I've put a request in to the Yard
for furthers and betters,

42:24.720 --> 42:27.320
but things are moving fast
since the Barnet arrest on Saturday

42:27.320 --> 42:28.960
and they're playing their cards
close.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.240
What do you make to that?

42:32.240 --> 42:33.880
The bomb lads couldn't say.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.320
Most likely it happened
in the explosion.

42:36.320 --> 42:40.520
Residue traces of wax,
clay and some sort of colourant.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.200
You're cutting it fine, aren't you?
What time's kick-off?

42:44.200 --> 42:47.560
Oh, not till 7:30, but I'm relieving
the Branch man at 6:00.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.160
Right.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.960
Well, see you there, then.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.080
SPECTATORS CHEER AND CHANT

42:58.440 --> 43:01.200
Oh, there you are!
Where the bloody hell have you been?

43:01.200 --> 43:03.120
Oh, sorry, we got caught
in the crowd. Yeah?

43:03.120 --> 43:04.920
Never mind the Micks
taking a crack at him.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.280
I'll give him the full treatment

43:06.280 --> 43:07.800
if he's late
for the team talk again.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.760
Ball in the back of the net,
isn't it, boss? Same as last week.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.520
I'll be grand from here.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.200
Morse, I hear you, er...

43:18.200 --> 43:20.640
enjoyed a night with the stars.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.360
This Is Your Life, wasn't it?
Oh...!

43:23.360 --> 43:26.120
DCI Thursday said he's very nice.

43:26.120 --> 43:27.440
Eamonn Andrews.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.080
Though less tall
than he appears on the television.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.800
Oh, well, I couldn't say, sir.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.600
Well, your charge should be
in safe hands.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.440

such a game.

Get him out of there!

46:01.200 --> 46:03.520
You're sure he got off the pitch?
He was ahead of me.

He'll be in the bath by now

46:05.920 --> 46:08.320
Look, I'll keep an eye on him

46:08.320 --> 46:10.400
and bring him up to the clubroom
after, yeah?

46:10.400 --> 46:11.720
All right.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.120
Well done, lads!

46:14.120 --> 46:18.520
The club moved to The Field
here at Potter's Lane in 1897.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.120
It'd been church land
up until the Reformation.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.000
Then, after that,
one of the colleges here

46:24.000 --> 46:26.160
got ahold of it
and they leased it back to the town

46:26.160 --> 46:27.800
as somewhere to bury their paupers.

46:27.800 --> 46:31.280
So, from Potter's Field
to The Field, Potter's Lane.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.720
I told you,
we had nothing to worry about.

46:34.720 --> 46:37.280
I thought he'd have been here
by now.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.720
Oh, they'll be having a few drinks,
a few laughs.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.200
Getting warm in the bath.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.560
Just young men
enjoying a bit of male camaraderie.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.240
Taking bets as to which one
of these lovely, young ladies

46:47.240 --> 46:50.600
is going to be a notch
on their bedpost by morning.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.480
I'm guessing you weren't
the sporty type.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.320
More of a bookworm. Am I right?

46:56.320 --> 46:58.360
Are you in need of a refill there,
Graham?

46:58.360 --> 47:00.840
This is my very dear friend
Mr Tressell.

47:00.840 --> 47:03.080
This is Jackie's bodyguard, Morse.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.640
Oh, you sponsored the fashion show
last night.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.280
Sorry, Robert.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.720
Erm, Graham, may I introduce you
to our Lady Mayoress?

47:10.720 --> 47:12.240
Of course.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.680
The warp and weft of civic life.

47:14.680 --> 47:16.600
Commerce, too, I should think.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.960
An evening at the football
as guest of the club chairman,

47:18.960 --> 47:21.040
it must be an atmosphere
convivial for business.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.040
Oh, well, what can I tell you?
It's good to be king.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.120
Are you looking for Jackie, Mr Ward?

47:27.120 --> 47:29.480
I'd leave him be a wee while.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.280
It's not a good time,
I don't reckon.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.080
Come on, Jack'll see us in the bar.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.360
Where's Jack? I thought you said
you were going to bring him up.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.280
I thought he'd come ahead.
No.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.800
WOMAN SOBS LOUDLY

47:53.880 --> 47:55.720
What is it?
He's...

47:55.720 --> 47:57.200
Oh, my God!

47:57.200 --> 47:59.800
Why weren't you watching him?

48:02.280 --> 48:03.880
Oh...

48:23.920 --> 48:26.320
Dead less than two hours.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.880
I don't want to jump the gun
ahead of the post-mortem,

48:28.880 --> 48:30.920
but death would appear to be
by drowning.

48:30.920 --> 48:35.760
However, there is also a sizeable
wound to the back of cranium.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.160
Could it have been accidental,
Doctor?

48:38.160 --> 48:41.280
He's slipped, fallen,
hit his head perhaps?

48:41.280 --> 48:42.640
It's possible.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.200
But more likely the blow
knocked him unconscious

48:45.200 --> 48:47.560
and he pitched forward
into the water.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.520
A blow from what?
I recovered that from the bath.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.840
Forensics haven't had a go at it
yet,

48:53.840 --> 48:56.400
but it's the right size and weight
to fit the bill.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.720
Number 10.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.920
That's Swift's jersey, isn't it?

48:59.920 --> 49:02.120
His girlfriend thought it was Swift,
sir.

49:02.120 --> 49:05.440
Easy mistake to make, I suppose,
if you're face-down in the water.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.960
Then, whoever did this,

49:06.960 --> 49:10.040
and presumably we advance from
a position of suspecting foul play,

49:10.040 --> 49:11.360
must have made the same error.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.440
Hell of a thing to get wrong.

49:13.440 --> 49:15.320
Well, a room full of steam.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.080
If they came upon him from behind,

49:17.080 --> 49:20.680
one could see how such a mistake
might be made.

49:20.680 --> 49:23.480
The threat was that Swift
would be shot, wasn't it, sir?

49:23.480 --> 49:24.880
Uniform searched everyone

49:24.880 --> 49:27.240
coming into the ground
for concealed weapons.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.520
Perhaps he had to improvise
with whatever was to hand.

49:29.520 --> 49:33.080
Of all things, what was Martinelli
doing wearing another man's jersey?

49:33.080 --> 49:35.520
It's not unknown for players
to swap shirts, sir,

49:35.520 --> 49:37.200
as a souvenir of their encounter.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.040
A mark of respect, sort of thing.

49:39.040 --> 49:42.240
A fan, perhaps,
angry about the result.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.560
According to uniform
and the ground staff,

49:44.560 --> 49:46.640
none of the punters
managed to get down here.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.880
The tunnel gate was locked

49:47.880 --> 49:50.480
once all the players and officials
were safely off the pitch.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.000
Then whoever did for him
was already inside the stadium.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.200
What about his team-mates,
where are they?

49:55.200 --> 49:57.640
The manager and most of the rest
have gone their own way.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.480
Those that stuck around
for the booze-up

49:59.480 --> 50:01.000
are still in the directors' box.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.920
Easy for anyone to slip out
for five minutes.

50:03.920 --> 50:06.160
And Swift,
what does he say about all this?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.760
We haven't managed
to speak to him yet, sir.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.960
I'd have thought he'd be first on
your list.

50:14.040 --> 50:16.160
He doesn't appear
to be in the building, sir.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.360
So, we have one dead footballer...

50:20.360 --> 50:23.040
and one whose life has been
threatened now missing!

50:24.480 --> 50:26.920
What do you think, Thursday?
Could Swift have done this?

50:28.120 --> 50:31.480
He had a pretty nasty set-to
with Martinelli on the pitch.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.440
If they swapped shirts, though, sir,

50:33.440 --> 50:36.160
it suggests any differences
have been forgotten.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.680
Very well,
I'll make my report to Division.

50:38.680 --> 50:41.400
You can brief me on any developments
in the morning.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.960
Carry on.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.240
Make a start with statements
and particulars

50:50.240 --> 50:51.840
from all interested parties, Jim.

50:53.200 --> 50:56.080
Set aside any without an alibi
since the end of the match.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.560
Sir.

51:00.560 --> 51:03.880
When Jack didn't come back with
the rest of the boys to the party,

51:03.880 --> 51:05.520
I came down here to look for him.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.360
And you didn't see anyone else
down there,

51:07.360 --> 51:08.840
didn't pass anyone on the stairs?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.520
No.

51:10.520 --> 51:14.240
I just saw him lying there
in the water and thought...

51:16.360 --> 51:18.000
You thought that it was Jack.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.200
SHE SOBS

51:26.480 --> 51:28.320
If somebody wanted
to kill Martinelli,

51:28.320 --> 51:30.040
there's plenty of other places
to do it.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.720
Why here? Why now?

51:31.720 --> 51:34.040
Well, perhaps it wasn't planned.

51:34.040 --> 51:36.200
Maybe it was a spur of the moment.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.480
Martinelli was wearing
Jack Swift's jersey, yes.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.360
But only someone
who'd never seen Jack before

51:40.360 --> 51:42.800
could mistake the one for the other.
Even from behind?

51:42.800 --> 51:44.920
Well, I think,
if I were an assassin,

51:44.920 --> 51:47.520
I'd want to be pretty sure
of my target. Wouldn't you?

51:48.560 --> 51:50.080
I just can't believe it.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.640
That lovely, young boy.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.720
I was only talking to him
after Jack's This Is Your Life.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.120
You've been here in this clubroom
all evening, have you?

52:00.120 --> 52:03.240
Yes. So has Robert. Haven't you?
What's this?

52:03.240 --> 52:05.840
You haven't left the clubroom
or the box tonight.

52:05.840 --> 52:08.120
Well, I did have to wash my hands.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.680
But I bumped into Ray, Mr Jubba,
in the gents.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.920
He was attending to his hair. We got
talking. Made our way back here.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.720
So you've been with somebody
all evening.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.200
That's right. And even if I hadn't
been, I'm in the rag trade.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.240
I'm not given to going round
murdering young footballers.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.080
Especially ones I'm about to sign.

52:25.600 --> 52:29.120
I'd just come down to tell Jackie
well done on the win, you know.

52:29.120 --> 52:32.840
But he was having a bit of a row
with his man Jubba, so...

52:32.840 --> 52:34.680
I just went back to the do.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.160
George Sellars will tell you.
He came back up with me.

52:37.160 --> 52:38.920
You saw Jack Swift?

52:39.880 --> 52:41.280
Well, he had his back to me,

52:41.280 --> 52:43.280
but I recognised his shirt,
you know.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.680
That wasn't Jack.
That was John-Paul Martinelli.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.360
What are you saying?

52:51.520 --> 52:54.160
Is it John-Paul something's happened
to and not Jack?

52:55.880 --> 52:57.480
Oh, God, no!

52:59.000 --> 53:01.160
Say that's not true.
I don't believe you.

53:01.160 --> 53:02.720
All that talent.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.080
All that skill.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.760
He could've been
ten times the player Jack is.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.040
What a waste!

53:14.040 --> 53:15.680
I came down to say well done
to Jackie.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.360
Only, I could see he was having
a set-to

53:17.360 --> 53:19.200
with the bloke that handles
his business.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.800
So, me and Duke
just came back up again.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.640
Except what you're saying now...

53:24.640 --> 53:26.280
it wasn't Jack?

53:26.280 --> 53:27.840
No, that's right.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.600
So, you came straight back up here
after?

53:29.600 --> 53:31.040
Aye. Well, Duke...

53:31.040 --> 53:33.840
Er, Mr Ward stopped off at the gents
for a Jimmy.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.000
I had Jack's mum and that to see to,
so I just left him to it.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.680
It was you, you bastard!

53:39.880 --> 53:41.880
What did you do to him?
That wee boy!

53:41.880 --> 53:44.720
What do you mean, what have I done?
I haven't done anything.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.040
I saw you with him!

53:46.040 --> 53:48.720
I thought it was Jackie you were
talking to. But it was John-Paul.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.960
Would he not go along
with your wee scheme, is that it?

53:50.960 --> 53:52.600
All right now, Duke, that's enough.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.320
What scheme would that be?
Well, he knows!

53:55.320 --> 53:58.360
They're all in on it.
I'll kill you, you rotten...!

53:58.360 --> 53:59.880
SHOUTING

53:59.880 --> 54:01.920
Get him out! Get him out!
I'll bloody kill you!!

54:04.960 --> 54:07.440
All right, I'm sorry,
I just saw red.

54:08.400 --> 54:10.880
All right, what was that all about?

54:12.440 --> 54:15.120
John-Paul phoned me up
before the match.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.520
He wanted to ask my advice.
About what?

54:19.240 --> 54:22.400
That Jubba, his agent,
or whatever the hell he is...

54:23.520 --> 54:25.880
..told him that if a chance came up
to score tonight,

54:25.880 --> 54:27.960
he was to stick it over the top
or put it wide.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.440
He should throw the match?

54:32.280 --> 54:34.960
If he wanted to come
to the Wanderers, that is.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.320
There's some sort of
betting syndicate behind it.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.400
Absolute tripe.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.680
Duke Ward, he's a bitter,
washed-up, old has-been.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.720
The boys he discovered, Jack,
John-Paul, rest his soul,

54:47.720 --> 54:50.480
made small fortunes,
living the high life,

54:50.480 --> 54:53.280
and he's cycling round Ulster
in all weathers

54:53.280 --> 54:54.880
still panning for gold.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.560
The other morning,
after the photoshoot,

54:58.560 --> 55:00.320
I overheard you and Ray Jubba

55:00.320 --> 55:03.680
discussing telling someone something
after the match.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.520
Who was it?
What were you gonna tell them?

55:05.520 --> 55:06.800
That? It...

55:08.280 --> 55:11.760
Well, it's got no bearing on what
might have happened to John-Paul.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.280
It can't have.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.640
We'll be the judge of that.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.640
We were talking about...

55:18.640 --> 55:21.640
putting Jack out on loan
to Fulchester. That was all.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.560
Look, there...
There's no shame in it.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.280
He's had a good run.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.760
12 years.

55:28.760 --> 55:32.000
He's just... not what he was.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.760
Which of us is, Mr Lofthouse?

55:37.680 --> 55:40.800
I suppose the day that the next
man's just that half a yard faster

55:40.800 --> 55:43.280
comes to all of us sooner or later.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.880
I suppose, for Swift,
Martinelli was that man.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.160
Nobody can outrun time.
Not even Jack Swift.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.640
Do you think he could've done it?

55:52.760 --> 55:54.400
SWIFT: Morse! Here he is.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.840
Who's this?

55:57.840 --> 55:59.960
This is Detective Chief Inspector
Thursday.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.400
Mr Swift.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.760
So, what happened to you?
I couldn't face it.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.600
Come on, don't be mad.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.840
Have a drink.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.320
We can't protect you
if you just disappear, Mr Swift.

56:12.320 --> 56:14.520
That's done with, isn't it?
We played the match.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.440
Nothing happened.
Well, you might have told

56:16.440 --> 56:17.840
Miss Eriksson you were leaving.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.960
Sure, you know what she's like.
I couldn't.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.200
Is she upset?

56:21.200 --> 56:23.160
Where did you go?
I came back here.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.800
Alone?
Of course, alone.

56:25.800 --> 56:29.640
That looked like a nasty set-to
with John-Paul Martinelli.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.000
The cheeky wee sh...
HE CHUCKLES

56:32.000 --> 56:33.600
That's just the game, you know.

56:33.600 --> 56:37.120
I shook his hand when the whistle
went and we swapped shirts.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.680
Then the fans started pouring onto
the pitch and we just legged it.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.600
Did you see him when you got off?
No.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.200
I looked for him, just to make sure
he was all right, like.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.880
Make sure the fans hadn't got
to him, missing that free kick.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.040
Why?
He's dead.

56:52.360 --> 56:56.440
He was found earlier this evening.
in the home team changing room...

56:56.440 --> 56:58.800
wearing your shirt.
Jesus...

57:00.160 --> 57:01.840
Oh, my God.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.280
They didn't think that he was me,
did they?

57:06.520 --> 57:08.400
What happened, is he shot?

57:08.400 --> 57:11.400
We can't be sure
it was a case of mistaken identity.

57:11.400 --> 57:15.320
But we do believe
that foul play was involved.

57:15.320 --> 57:17.400
Your friend Mr Ward seemed to think

57:17.400 --> 57:20.280
he'd got caught up
in some kind of racket.

57:20.280 --> 57:23.440
How do you mean?
Fixing the game.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.040
He got it into his head
your agent was involved.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.240
No, man.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.080
That's just Duke. You don't...

57:30.080 --> 57:32.640
You don't want to put anything
into what he says.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.120
That's just his way.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.440
FRONT DOOR CLOSES

57:37.400 --> 57:39.280
What the hell are you playing at?

57:39.280 --> 57:40.760
I've been going out of my mind!

57:40.760 --> 57:43.200
There was no need.
I'm perfectly fine.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.920
Mr Swift...

57:44.920 --> 57:45.960
Come on...

57:45.960 --> 57:48.640
Will you be all right minding
the shop till the relief gets here?

57:48.640 --> 57:49.920
Right-ho.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.240
FRONT DOOR CLOSES

58:16.200 --> 58:17.840
DOORBELL CHIMES

58:22.800 --> 58:25.360
You had some excitement last night,
didn't you?

58:25.360 --> 58:27.840
Word is, whoever they sent after him
got the wrong man.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.360
Well, that presumes
it was who they sent after him.

58:30.360 --> 58:33.200
If you ask me, I think the whole
thing's a bloody wild-goose chase.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.240
Perhaps. The coffee's on.

58:38.120 --> 58:39.920
I think, if I hated someone enough

58:39.920 --> 58:42.040
to kill them,
I'd know how to spell their name.

58:42.040 --> 58:43.400
Don't you?

58:43.400 --> 58:45.520
Someone smart playing the fool?

58:45.520 --> 58:47.280
Smart enough to know that Stamfield

58:47.280 --> 58:49.280
wouldn't open his own post,
certainly.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.200
There was a Valentine's card.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.840
At her bedsit.
From her fiance, I took it.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.000
Noel Baxter.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.320
No, in the wreckage of her office.

58:58.320 --> 59:00.560
It's possible a girl could have
two unknown admirers.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.760
True.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.720
But it'd be handy to know
who he was,

59:03.720 --> 59:05.760
this other man, don't you think?

59:07.880 --> 59:10.080
Further to your letter the 3rd inst,

59:10.080 --> 59:13.280
as mentioned
in my previous correspondence,

59:13.280 --> 59:15.800
the college's position
on entertaining...

59:24.680 --> 59:27.240
You still do The Pools?
Yeah.

59:27.240 --> 59:29.680
I've been at the old eight from ten
for 35 years

59:29.680 --> 59:31.440
and never won so much
as a thruppenny bit.

59:31.440 --> 59:33.000
Why do you still do it?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.440
I'm an optimist.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.680
I used to do it with Sam
when he was small, you know.

59:38.680 --> 59:41.920
We'd study the league results
in the paper, who'd won, who'd lost

59:41.920 --> 59:44.080
and who was due for a draw.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.440
I used to take him down Potter's
Lane when we first came to Oxford.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.080
The Field, you know,
the Wanderers' ground,

59:50.080 --> 59:52.800
watch the home game
from the terraces.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.200
Did you ever...?

59:54.200 --> 59:55.840
No.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.320
It'll be useful to know who

59:57.320 --> 1:00:00.320
Miss Widdowson's other admirer was,
don't you think?

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:05.320
Well, we're going to be tied up
with Martinelli.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:08.200
And if you're gonna be fit for
keeping an eye on Swift all night,

1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:10.680
if I was you, I'd get some kip.
Oh, I'll sleep when I'm dead.

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:09.440
Did you give your fiancee
a Valentine's card?

1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:13.280
I was working in Hastings
over the weekend, and...

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:14.720
what with the post being
what it is,

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:17.320
I dropped it round her flat Monday
afternoon on my lunch break.

1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:19.040
Dropped it round her flat, yeah?

1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.680
How did she seem,
the last time you saw her?

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:24.040
Excited.

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:27.800
She'd just come into some money,
or was about to.

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:29.240
A great aunt was very ill,

1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:32.400
and Maggie said she'd always been
her favourite, so...

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:34.120
So she had expectations?

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.280
Enough for a deposit on a flat
for us, she thought.

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:37.560
Did she?
Yeah.

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:40.120
It was a relief,
as her bedsit had been burgled

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:41.400
the week before last.

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:44.520
Not that there was much to take.
She reported it, presumably?

1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:46.440
To the police?

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:48.080
I told her to, but...

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:49.600
she couldn't see the point.

1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:58.880
STAMFIELD:
A special service to commemorate

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:01.440
the loss of Miss Widdowson

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.520
will be held on the second Sunday
after Septuagesima...

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:11.080
and all the academic faculty
will be expected to attend.

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.200
Thank you for waiting.
No problem.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.840
You were here on Monday?
That's right.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.480
Is there news?
I'm afraid not.

1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:24.120
I'm just following a few avenues
of inquiry.

1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:27.600
I wonder, did Miss Widdowson
ever talk to you

1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:28.840
about her personal life?

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:30.400
To me?
Mm-hm.

1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:32.080
No. Not particularly,
I don't recall.

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:34.920
But you knew she was engaged,
presumably?

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:36.680
Miss Newell may have mentioned it.

1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:41.160
I wonder, did she have any admirers
here at college?

1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:45.400
If there were, it's not something
she ever vouchsafed to me.

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:46.560
Mm.

1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:50.280
I understand,
in the general scheme of things,

1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:52.560
she wouldn't ordinarily have been
in the office

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.560
at the time of the explosion.

1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:58.200
There isn't an hour goes by
I don't reproach myself, believe me.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:00.560
One can't conduct business
with others

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:04.440
as if they might be about to die
at any moment, but...

1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:06.720
God knows how many times
these past few days

1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:09.560
I've wished I'd never given
Miss Widdowson a ticking off.

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.880
HE RATTLES A LOCKED DRAWER

1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:25.480
CABINET DOOR CREAKS OPEN

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.920
KNOCKING,
DOOR OPENS

1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:52.200
Forensics came back with a set
of dabs on the champagne bottle.

1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:54.720
It's a match for one of the sets
we took last night.

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.400
Not leaving us, Mr Sellars?

1:03:57.400 --> 1:03:59.920
No. Just seeing Jack's family
to the station.

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:01.040
Fair enough.

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:03.640
We're gonna need a further statement
from you about last night.

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:06.960
Marmaduke Ward?

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.720
I'm arresting you on suspicion

1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:11.720
of the murder
of John-Paul Martinelli.

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:22.280
Mr Sarson?

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.320
Thank you.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.840
She was typing up a paper for you?
My thesis.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.240
Mm.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.600
There was a Valentine's card
recovered from the office.

1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:41.960
One-four-three.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:45.600
She liked to do the crossword
on her way into work...

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:46.760
on the 33.

1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:48.800
One-four-three.

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:50.200
I love you.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:57.120
Did she know how you felt about her?
No.

1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.840
Were you aware
she was engaged to be married?

1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:01.880
I'd seen her engagement ring,
of course.

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:03.760
But...

1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:05.240
a fella can hope.

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:09.680
When did you leave the card?
Before it got light on Monday.

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:13.960
And how did you get into college?

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:16.440
In through here,
the fellows' garden.

1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.240
There's a gate that gives on
to the lane.

1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:20.800
It's kept shut overnight,

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:23.680
but you can snick the lock
if you have the knack.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:27.920
It was already open when I got here.

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:31.640
As a matter of fact,
I almost got caught.

1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:43.560
MORSE: It was the Master?

1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:47.240
I didn't see his face,
but the lights were on in his rooms

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:49.040
and he was coming out of the office.

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:52.080
So, I assumed he was just in
early to work.

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:55.440
And when you left
the Valentine's card,

1:05:55.440 --> 1:05:58.200
did you notice a brown paper package
on Maggie's desk?

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.880
I'm sorry, I...

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.640
I was so rattled
by almost running into old Stammers,

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.120
my heart was in my mouth.

1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:08.400
I just dropped the card off and ran.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.200
Right.

1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:14.600
I've stood on the sidelines
of football pitches in all weathers.

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:18.800
This playing field, that youth club.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.280
Nights so freezing cold

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:23.360
I couldn't feel my hands or feet
cycling back home.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:25.280
All for the game.

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:28.600
HE SCOFFS

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:34.480
All those boys whose early promise
never came to anything.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.760
The ones who lacked the nerve.

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:40.040
The ones who would get some girl
in the family way...

1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:43.520
and then grind all the hopes
that you had for them into the dirt.

1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:45.040
Year in, year out.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.800
You wonder what the hell
you've done with your life.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:52.880
And then, one day...

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:54.480
you see a boy...

1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:01.080
..with talent
so out of the ordinary...

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:04.560
..that it could only have come
from the Almighty.

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:06.320
Jack Swift.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.240
You do what you can
to take them under your wing.

1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:17.080
You know...

1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:18.320
train them up.

1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:23.280
And then watch them throw it
all away on trivial things.

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:26.000
Fast living.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.520
Women. Cars.

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.040
Frivolities.

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:34.400
You were afraid history would repeat
itself with Martinelli.

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:36.200
I found that boy.

1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:42.160
I gave him the world.

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:45.720
I tried to warn him about Ray Jubba.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:46.800
But...

1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:50.040
..he just turned away from me,

1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:53.000
like I was some... beggarman.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.560
Is that when you hit him?

1:07:56.200 --> 1:07:59.280
We've got your fingerprints
on the champagne bottle.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.480
I took the bottle off him.

1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.200
He was about to open it.

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:17.680
I said to him,
"Is this what you want?

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:20.600
"Is this all it means to you?"

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:24.960
I took the bottle off him,

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:30.160
but I set it down on the bench
by the door on my way out.

1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:38.360
Harm a hair on that wee boy's head?

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:43.920
I'd sooner have cut my own throat.

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:54.440
HE TURNS THE ENGINE OFF

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:08.880
Morse.

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.200
Miss Thursday.

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:14.840
I'm, er...
I'm looking for a Mrs O'Rourke.

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.560
Maggie's sister.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:19.440
Jim came by. Strange. Erm...

1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:23.000
She's taken her little girl to
the park, but she'll be back soon.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.800
If you want to wait.

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:32.080
Do you want a drink?

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:33.480
Bit early for me.

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:37.640
And to be honest,
I'd sooner you didn't...

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:39.000
if you're gonna talk to the kids.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.400
It's just most of them
have experience of...

1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:42.960
men who reek of booze.

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.600
Well... waste not, want not.

1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:49.960
Thanks.

1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.400
You never used to be so censorious.

1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:58.080
Well, you never used to put it away
in the middle of the afternoon.

1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:00.520
"Put it away in the middle
of the afternoon"? Come on.

1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.400
What will be next?
"I'm going back to mother"?

1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:08.120
I feel like I missed something.

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.560
No.

1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:12.960
Are you sure?

1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:18.200
Well, if you did,
then it was nothing much.

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:21.720
The mess you mentioned
when you wrote,

1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:24.520
did you manage to put it right,
or...?

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:27.680
Oh, yes, that all...
That all ended as it should.

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:32.920
Morse...

1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.200
What is this place?

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.320
Some kind of halfway house?

1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:40.320
I don't know it
from the council list.

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.680
It's not council, just...

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:46.400
somewhere they can get away to.

1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:49.760
If they need help.
Somewhere they can be safe.

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:54.520
You're saving the world.

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:55.960
SHE CHUCKLES

1:10:57.520 --> 1:10:59.040
One woman at a time.

1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:11.120
What's she like, Mrs O'Rourke?

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:13.120
Jim didn't say?

1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.800
Well, I think Detective Sergeant
Strange has many qualities,

1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:18.320
but I wouldn't rank sensitivity
paramount amongst them.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:19.960
Oh, I don't know. In my experience,

1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:22.640
he can be quite thoughtful
when the occasion demands it.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.840
In your experience?
You want to try living with him.

1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:30.680
I heard he ended up in hospital.

1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.200
Dad said you saved him.

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:35.880
No.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:39.200
No, you shouldn't believe everything
that you hear.

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:43.080
And poor Mr Bright.

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:48.080
Yeah, it was a bad year.

1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:54.760
How was, erm...?

1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:56.040
Stevenage.
Mm.

1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:59.240
I thought it might be a new start.

1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:04.080
But it turns out...
children can be just as miserable

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:06.560
and neglected there
as they can in Oxford.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:10.920
And with Sam away,
I didn't like to leave Mum.

1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:12.520
So...

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:15.120
..I came back.

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:21.000
Hm.

1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.440
Did Mrs O'Rourke ever mention
a great aunt

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.440
of whom she had expectations?
TOY RATTLES

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:31.640
Not to me.

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:33.040
I really think she should be here

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:34.720
if you're gonna go through
her things.

1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:37.680
I'm not going through her things.
I'm just looking.

1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:42.520
What was it Miss Widdowson brought
for the children?

1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:45.480
Just a box of toys
and the doll's house.

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:46.920
Why?

1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:50.480
Well, I think she thought...

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:52.800
someone intended her harm.

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:57.400
Her bedsit was broken into
last week.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:00.800
She was burgled?
No, that's not what I said.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.640
I think someone
was looking for something.

1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:07.560
Only, they didn't find it because...

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.840
..she's hidden it somewhere safe.

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:28.880
THURSDAY: Professor Stamfield...

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:30.360
Can we have a word?

1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:31.720
Yes, of course.

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:34.960
You'll have to excuse me.

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.080
We're still in a state
of some disarray after...

1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:39.960
..after the tragedy.

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:43.720
Still managing to keep up
with your correspondence, though.

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:46.040
I should think that thing's
a godsend, isn't it?

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:48.760
Oh, yes. I don't know
what I ever did without it.

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:50.920
I'm partial to a gadget, myself.

1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:53.280
These, er, cassette tapes
they have now, is it?

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:54.720
That's right.

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:58.240
My sergeant played me a cassette
tape he came by this afternoon.

1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:00.640
I'd be glad of your opinion of it.
Morse...

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:08.040
STAMFIELD ON TAPE: 'It has come to
my attention that undergraduates

1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.120
'have been using the fellows'
garden entrance after curfew.'

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:13.760
Not only is this...
Mr Fenner, Master.

1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:15.960
Robert! Come in, do.

1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:18.240
Thank you, Maggie.
Thank you, Maggie.

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:20.960
Sherry, or something stronger?

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.720
Er, Scotch, if we're celebrating.

1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:26.000
I say, this is smart.
I must get me one of these.

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.560
Testing, testing...
I wouldn't be without it.

1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:32.080
Of course, it's no substitute for a
pert little secretary on one's lap.

1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:33.360
Absolutely!

1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.920
So...

1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:39.360
The Field.

1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:45.840
The Field that Fenner mentions
is the Wanderers' home turf.

1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:48.720
Now, the team is so-called because,
originally, they shared a ground

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:50.760
with any football or rugby club
who'd have them.

1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:54.160
But in 1897,
they were granted a 75-year lease

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:57.760
on a field at Potter's Lane
by the college that owned the land.

1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:00.880
This college.
1897.

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.040
Which means the lease expires
next year.

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.800
Worth a bob or two, I should think,
the land the stadium sits on.

1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:08.080
I can explain.
Let's hope so.

1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:10.160
Because, as the tape goes on,

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:13.240
it sounds like you're conniving
with Fenner to make sure the college

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.080
refuses to renew
the Wanderers' lease.

1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:17.440
Then, presumably
after a decent interval,

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:19.600
Fenner acquires the land
for redevelopment

1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.560
and you get a fee for services
rendered.

1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:25.480
STAMFIELD:
'The college must never find out.'

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.280
FENNER:
'I've got as much to lose as you.'

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:30.240
If the Wanderers got wind
that their chairman had conspired

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:32.840
to steal their home ground out
from under them,

1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:34.920
the fans would string me up.

1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:38.440
So, don't worry.
No-one will find out.

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:41.120
It's just between you and me.

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:44.600
But unfortunately, it didn't stay
just between you and Fenner, did it?

1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:46.200
As she does every afternoon,

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:49.400
Maggie Widdowson came in
to collect the cassette tape

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:51.280
and type up your correspondence.

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:54.880
STAMFIELD: 'Is that altogether
legal, Robert?'

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:57.800
FENNER: 'Well, if it was,
you wouldn't be in line

1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:00.240
'for 15% kickback on the deal,
would you?'

1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.760
She told her fiance
that she was expecting a bequest

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:03.960
from a great aunt.

1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:05.920
We spoke to her family.

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:08.280
There was no great aunt.

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.440
Nor was there any windfall due.

1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:14.360
So, how much did she ask for?

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.000
5,000.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:20.960
Is that what she died for, £5,000?

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:23.240
Against all that you and Fenner
stood to make?

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:26.640
No. I wanted to pay her off.
So, why didn't you?

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:34.800
Swift not training today?

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:38.640
No, the manager's given him
the day off after everything.

1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:40.640
We've just come from Lonsdale.

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:42.280
Presumably it was Mr Tressell,

1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.880
the building contractor
who sponsored your fashion show,

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.240
that provided you with the dynamite.
What's this?

1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:49.920
Though I don't suppose
he knew it was meant for the bomb

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.680
you used to kill Maggie Widdowson.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:55.080
The country reeling from a spate
of bombings by the Angry Brigade,

1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:57.840
yours might have been taken
for the same.

1:16:57.840 --> 1:16:59.840
Only, this time,
with fatal consequences.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:04.120
You can't prove a word of this.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.800
Actually, we can.

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:07.960
The fragments that remain
of the brown paper

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.440
that the bomb was wrapped in
show that it had been marked

1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:13.720
with a substance containing wax,
clay and colourant.

1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:15.360
Dressmaker's chalk.

1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:18.080
On the same brown paper,
I'd seen used by your pattern cutter

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:19.480
ahead of your fashion show.

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:22.040
You're gonna need more than that.

1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:25.280
We've also got the alarm clock
you used as a timer.

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:26.760
What's left of it, at least.

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:29.680
Forensics have put it back together.

1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:31.400
So there's that.

1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:32.840
I've never owned an alarm clock.

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:34.000
Really?
No.

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.360
Only, it matches one
in a photograph of Mrs Fenner

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.360
taken in your bedroom that appeared
in the colour supplement.

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:42.120
You must think I'm a fool.

1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:44.960
What sort of a man
would use materials from work

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:47.560
and his wife's own alarm clock
to make a bomb?

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:49.240
A very arrogant man.

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:52.320
The kind who thinks an explosion
would destroy all evidence

1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:54.200
that could trace the bomb back
to him.

1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:57.760
We also have a confession
from your accomplice, of course.

1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:00.280
Now, Professor Stamfield told us
that you'd told him

1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:01.920
you'd leave the hush money

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:04.320
that Maggie Widdowson demanded
on her desk.

1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:06.480
But instead, you left an explosive.

1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:09.840
He's a liar.
You were seen

1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.640
leaving the Master's office
in the early hours of the morning

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.800
by a young man intent
on leaving a Valentine's card

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:16.000
to the woman you murdered.

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:20.920
The gown and mortarboard
was a nice touch.

1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:22.240
But no don would be abroad

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.440
in full academic rig
at that time of night.

1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:26.240
What was it?

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:27.720
You thought she'd ask for more?

1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:29.840
That's usually the way
with blackmailers.

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:34.600
Or did you just want to make sure
her mouth was shut?

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.480
Robert Fenner, I am arresting you
for the murder of Maggie Widdowson.

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:49.160
BRIGHT: They've admitted it?

1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:51.720
Both declining to answer
on the advice of their lawyers, sir.

1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:54.560
Much good that will do when they've
already condemned themselves

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.360
out of their own mouths
on the recording.

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:59.040
Taken together with
the forensic evidence,

1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:02.680
I can't see any jury giving them
the benefit of the doubt.

1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:05.760
Well...

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:08.040
..excellent work.

1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:09.440
Carry on.
Sir.

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:15.120
Sir, are you sure Ward wasn't
at the Plaza Hotel on Saturday?

1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:17.280
We checked.
The call was made on Saturday,

1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:19.240
but none of the guests
for This Is Your Life

1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:21.160
were booked into the Plaza
till Monday.

1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:23.640
No, that's not entirely correct.

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:26.680
Swift said he saw one of them
in town last week.

1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:38.640
Detective Sergeant Morse,
Mrs Sellars.

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:41.720
Chief Inspector Thursday.
Thames Valley. Is your husband here?

1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:44.360
No, not at the minute.
Perhaps you can help us.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.840
It's not very convenient.
We shan't take long.

1:19:55.880 --> 1:19:57.880
Oh, could you leave that, please?

1:19:57.880 --> 1:19:59.400
I've a bad headache.

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:05.280
When did you get to Oxford
for the This Is Your Life programme?

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:06.880
Monday.

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:08.080
You flew in, or...?

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:10.160
Yes, the programme sent the...

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:13.640
They took care of all that.

1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:16.320
And your husband?
When did he get in to Oxford?

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:18.400
He came with me.
Really?

1:20:18.400 --> 1:20:20.720
Only, he was seen here last week.

1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:27.160
Is yours a happy marriage,
Mrs Sellars?

1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:32.160
I'm as happy as I've always been.

1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:38.400
Your husband? Why?

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:42.800
At the party after the show
the other night, he was jealous.

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:45.960
Of you and Jack Swift?
Me and Jack?

1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.000
God, no.

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.280
You wore a ring on a chain
in the message

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:50.640
that you made for him.

1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:53.080
I saw that ring this morning
at Mr Swift's house.

1:20:56.120 --> 1:20:57.360
Mrs Sellers?

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:02.720
We bunked off school
and went to Portrush.

1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.960
This beautiful blue day.

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.680
Barry's Amusement Park.

1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:10.320
Down the arcade there were these
gumball lucky dip machines.

1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:13.240
You put your money in and turn
the handle and it's a surprise,

1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:15.240
cos you don't know
what you're gonna get.

1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:17.760
Out pops this little
plastic egg thing.

1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:20.560
We opened it up and there it was,
a heart-shaped ring.

1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:24.560
He closed it on my finger
and said he loved me.

1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:29.000
I could probably have been
Mrs Swift, too.

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.400
We might've had a regular life
together.

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:35.560
Only, Duke Ward put
the finish to it.

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.120
How's that?

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.800
He told Jack he wouldn't recommend
him for trials over here.

1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:41.800
He made it plain.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:43.720
It was me or football.

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:47.040
So, Jack Swift got fame and fortune,
and you got his best friend.

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:49.480
I don't know if it's just he wanted
something Jack had had

1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:51.280
or if he felt something for me,
but...

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:54.720
..George asked and, by that stage,

1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:57.320
I didn't much care
one way or another.

1:21:57.320 --> 1:22:01.120
Right, so, why was your ring
in Mr Swift's house?

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:03.680
He came to see me after the match.

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:06.120
When he saw what George had done.

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:07.400
Why?

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:10.400
I'll kill him.

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:12.240
Stop, now. Stop.

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:14.600
You were always my girl, Sarah.

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.240
I never stopped loving you.

1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:19.960
I love you still.

1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:23.080
Come on Jack, stop. Erm...

1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:25.160
It's half a lifetime ago.

1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:27.560
You're in love with a girl
dead and gone these 15 years.

1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:30.680
I'm not her any more.
And she's not me.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.280
Here...

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:41.200
I've held on to it long enough.

1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.280
Some things you have to let be.

1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:49.840
You should go.

1:22:57.440 --> 1:22:59.520
If Jack Swift wasn't the cause

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:02.920
of your husband's jealousy,
then who was it?

1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:07.520
John-Paul Martinelli.

1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.320
It was him that your husband
was looking for

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.040
when he ran into Duke Ward,
not Jack.

1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:14.360
He was a good-looking boy.
But it was nothing.

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:17.800
Five minutes in a laundry closet.
Just... fun.

1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:19.480
A bit of life.

1:23:19.480 --> 1:23:23.040
How did your husband find out?
Oh, he smelt his aftershave on me.

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:25.240
So, what was he doing in Oxford
last week?

1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:26.680
I don't know.

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:30.640
But he has a gun in the case.
I saw it when he was packing.

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:36.400
Why would your husband have a gun?
He doesn't tell me the half of it.

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:39.920
Out with the lads after dark
playing soldiers with the boyos.

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:43.800
So, you're saying, what,
he's part of some Loyalist militia?

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:46.440
You think it's just the other side
deals in guns and bombs?

1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:49.160
You people,
you get what you see in the papers,

1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:51.360
but you've really no idea
how things are.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:53.920
The Order, the 12th,
the pipes and drums.

1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:55.480
Them hating us, us hating them.

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:57.560
Where is he, Mrs Sellars?
Where's your husband?

1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:58.680
SHE SIGHS

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:03.200
DOORBELL CHIMES

1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:05.000
Are you expecting anyone?

1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:16.240
GUNSHOT

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:20.280
Christ!

1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:22.920
What have you done? Is he dead?
He'd better be.

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:27.680
SHE SCREAMS
Shut up!

1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:29.720
Bridge, be quiet, love. George...

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:32.760
Whatever this is,
she's no part of it.

1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:35.400
Have you gone mad?
By order of the Brigade Staff.

1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:37.360
The Brigade? The bloody Blacknecks?

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:40.320
Tried in absentia and found guilty
of providing funds...

1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:41.720
Georgie...
..providing funds

1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:43.920
to the Provisional
Irish Republican Army.

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:45.320
What? Where?

1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:48.000
You played in a charity exhibition
five-a-side game last year.

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.520
Some of the proceeds
went to enemies of the Crown.

1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:53.360
Jesus, George!
I must do 50 charity things a year!

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:55.440
I don't know what it's for
or where the money goes.

1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:58.120
Ray organises my time.
I just turn up and play!

1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:00.280
That's too bad.
W-W-Wait a minute, please...!

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.200
Five-a-side was for, er...

1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:06.800
was for youth clubs.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.600
It was for kids who like football,
George.

1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:12.120
Same as we did. It was for kids.

1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:14.760
Catholic kids.

1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:17.400
And some part of the money
you raised found its way

1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:18.880
into the Taigs' war chest.

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:21.080
The sentence is death, Jackie.

1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:22.680
You tell them I wasn't afraid.

1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:24.800
I'll tell them you begged.

1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:27.400
Then you'll be a liar
as well as a killer.

1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:31.320
The mission's over, Mr Sellars.

1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:32.880
You...

1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:34.960
Jesus, God!

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:37.800
Do I have to have a massacre here?!
No, nobody dies here.

1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:46.280
If you kill Jack, all sympathy
for your cause will be gone.

1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:48.520
It would be an own goal.
Drop it!

1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:50.400
Down on your knees.
Put the gun on the floor.

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.000
On your knees!

1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:12.160
A plot to murder one of their own

1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:15.120
for which their enemy
would be held culpable.

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:19.000
Hell of a coup
if they'd pulled it off.

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.760
Is this what it's come to, Thursday,

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:24.280
gunmen roaming the streets,
political violence?

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:26.040
It's war.

1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:28.760
Undeclared, perhaps.
But war all the same.

1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:31.160
A one-off, surely?

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:34.560
Swift's crossed these people,
upset them in some particular.

1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:36.160
I hope you're right, sir.

1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:40.840
But it feels more like the start
of something than the end.

1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:44.400
Pray God you're wrong, Thursday.

1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:47.680
I pray God you're wrong.

1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:51.760
Are you all right?

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:53.360
Would you be?

1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:56.280
We grew up together.

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:01.080
Is that it? Are we safe?

1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:03.440
Well, at least we know
what the plan is now.

1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:05.760
If they were to do it again,
then they'd have to own it.

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:07.800
And I don't think
they have the stomach for that.

1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:09.440
I won't live in fear.

1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:10.960
Hopefully, you won't have to.

1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:14.800
But Special Branch will keep
a watching brief, just to be sure.

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:16.680
How's your man?

1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:18.920
Oh, he's in with a chance,
they tell me.

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.480
Well...

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.760
Er, good luck with the, erm...
the football cup.

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.040
HE LAUGHS

1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:28.280
Thanks.

1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:31.760
Morse...

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:33.080
Thank you.

1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:41.080
Can we make it stick, do you think,
for Martinelli?

1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:42.880
Well, we've motive and opportunity,

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:45.080
but the evidence
is circumstantial at best.

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:49.160
Taken together with an attempted on
Swift, his girl and the Branch man,

1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:51.200
it might carry some weight.

1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:53.800
I can understand Martinelli.
That was jealousy.

1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:55.400
Something personal.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:56.680
But this?

1:27:56.680 --> 1:27:58.240
Sectarianism.

1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:00.880
Maybe we're as much what we hate
as what we love.

1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:04.280
In the end, we all pick a team.

1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:05.640
Or a team picks you.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:09.760
Not if you're no good at sports.
I was always the last to be chosen.

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:11.680
The one neither side
wanted in the team.

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:13.360
I chose you.

1:28:56.520 --> 1:28:59.800
