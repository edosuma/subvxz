00:36.890 --> 00:39.381
There is an ancient lndian saying

00:39.459 --> 00:44.419
that something lives only as long
as the last person who remembers it.

00:44.631 --> 00:48.761
My people have come to trust
memory over history.

00:49.202 --> 00:53.400
Memory, like fire, is radiant and immutable,

00:54.274 --> 00:58.142
while history serves only those
who seek to control it,

00:58.211 --> 01:00.941
those who would douse
the flame of memory

01:01.014 --> 01:04.506
in order to put out
the dangerous fire of truth.

01:05.251 --> 01:09.813
Beware these men, for they are
dangerous themselves,

01:09.889 --> 01:12.016
and unwise.

01:12.092 --> 01:17.291
Their false history is written in the blood
of those who might remember,

01:17.397 --> 01:19.797
and of those who seek the truth.

01:21.334 --> 01:22.801
Get down! Get down!

01:22.869 --> 01:24.632
Don't move!

01:25.205 --> 01:27.867
On your knees. Hands behind your head.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.810
- l wanna know where Mulder is.
- l don't know.

01:33.346 --> 01:36.281
His car is parked outside. He was here.

01:37.417 --> 01:40.079
l want Mulder and l want those files.

01:40.153 --> 01:42.678
You will find nothing here.

02:02.308 --> 02:04.276
What happened?

02:04.377 --> 02:06.402
There were men.

02:07.247 --> 02:10.216
They were looking for your partner.

02:11.317 --> 02:13.217
Where is he?

02:37.043 --> 02:38.567
Mulder!

04:05.565 --> 04:06.964
Out of the car!

04:07.467 --> 04:08.866
Come on!

04:08.968 --> 04:11.801
Hands on top! Spread your legs!

04:13.773 --> 04:17.231
- Where's Agent Mulder?
- Turn and face away!

04:17.877 --> 04:19.970
Where are the files?

04:20.046 --> 04:21.843
ln the trunk.

04:34.928 --> 04:36.987
- We need the DAT copy.
- l don't have it.

04:37.096 --> 04:38.654
Who has it?

04:38.731 --> 04:40.358
Agent Mulder.

04:42.969 --> 04:44.596
Let's go!

04:56.549 --> 05:00.280
lt is the recommendation of the
Office of Professional Conduct

05:00.653 --> 05:05.022
that Special Agent Dana Scully
be given a mandatory leave of absence

05:05.091 --> 05:09.084
until the full detail of her misconduct
can be calculated.

05:10.296 --> 05:14.790
This summary action is justified
under the OPC articles of review,

05:14.867 --> 05:20.203
and Agent Scully will complete her
suspension of duty without pay or benefits

05:20.506 --> 05:23.669
due to the nature of her insubordination,

05:23.743 --> 05:27.770
and the direct disobedience
of her superior agents.

05:28.381 --> 05:32.841
We will have to ask that you check
your weapon and your badge

05:32.952 --> 05:36.353
before you leave the building, Agent Scully.

05:43.429 --> 05:48.765
Make yourself available to answer further
questions on Agent Mulder's whereabouts.

05:52.005 --> 05:57.409
l've told you everything l know. To the best
of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is dead.

05:59.312 --> 06:03.248
Don't think this hasn't
been difficult for everyone.

06:17.997 --> 06:19.988
Agent Scully.

06:20.933 --> 06:23.094
Who are these people?

06:25.171 --> 06:26.729
They're doing theirjob.

06:26.806 --> 06:30.401
They're putting an official stamp
on the perpetuation of a lie.

06:30.510 --> 06:33.502
They're following protocol,
which you and Agent Mulder did not.

06:33.613 --> 06:36.912
And the people poisoning Mulder's water?
Whose protocol was that?

06:37.016 --> 06:40.076
- The investigation...
- Will be an exercise.

06:40.153 --> 06:43.418
The men who killed Agent Mulder
and his father aren't meant to be found.

06:43.489 --> 06:45.457
We will find them.

06:45.558 --> 06:50.962
With all due respect, l think you overestimate
your position in the chain of command.

07:22.962 --> 07:25.954
Where were the safeguards against this?

07:26.065 --> 07:28.431
These files were never to be seen.

07:28.501 --> 07:32.494
Forty years of work.
The damage could be incalculable.

07:32.972 --> 07:37.534
- The damage is done.
- Gentlemen, we have control.

07:37.844 --> 07:42.474
The files have been recovered and the men
involved in the theft have been removed.

07:42.882 --> 07:48.286
There is a matter of concern with the FBl.
We'll handle that internally, as usual.

07:48.888 --> 07:52.688
The media attention will amount
to a few scattered obituaries.

07:53.826 --> 07:55.123
The Mulder problem.

07:58.965 --> 08:00.694
Special Agent Mulder is dead.

08:02.301 --> 08:04.599
His body will not be recovered.

08:04.770 --> 08:08.797
He'll be listed as missing until
the matter can be resolved quietly.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.902
And we've recovered the copy
of the stolen computer files?

08:13.012 --> 08:14.377
Yes.

08:14.814 --> 08:19.251
Then the pertinent parties should be
informed and we can continue with our work.

08:22.155 --> 08:24.419
- Dana!
- Hi, Mom.

08:24.490 --> 08:26.981
What are you doing with your shoes?

08:27.059 --> 08:30.256
They started to give me blisters, so...

08:30.363 --> 08:33.457
You walked here at this time of night?

08:34.500 --> 08:36.160
Oh, Mom...

08:37.503 --> 08:41.563
- What is it, Dana?
- l've made a terrible mistake.

08:44.944 --> 08:47.708
Dad would be so ashamed of me.

08:52.451 --> 08:56.717
The men who had come and threatened us
did not return to our house again.

08:57.723 --> 09:01.090
But the following day
some of the boys from the reservation

09:01.827 --> 09:06.423
came to tell us they had seen buzzards
flying out near the quarry

09:06.532 --> 09:09.296
where Eric had first encountered the men.

09:12.972 --> 09:16.237
The buzzard is a large but cowardly bird.

09:16.309 --> 09:20.871
lt does not work for its prey,
letting others provide the kill.

09:21.514 --> 09:24.347
When l see them circling in the desert,

09:24.450 --> 09:30.047
this can only mean that something has died
and they are going to pick its bones.

09:30.556 --> 09:32.751
Or that death is close

09:32.825 --> 09:36.386
and they are waiting for it
to do its work for them.

09:36.796 --> 09:39.128
We did not see what they saw,

09:39.232 --> 09:43.669
but l remembered something
l had seen as a younger man.

09:44.036 --> 09:46.698
Just as my grandson had done,

09:46.772 --> 09:49.832
l too had found a body at the quarry,

09:49.942 --> 09:53.343
in a hole, half buried under rocks.

09:53.412 --> 09:56.745
But even the buzzards, who will eat anything,

09:56.816 --> 09:58.477
would not touch it.

09:58.551 --> 10:02.647
This spot is where we found
what the buzzards had come for.

10:03.556 --> 10:06.855
We could not tell at first who or what it was,

10:06.959 --> 10:09.985
but l knew what the buzzards knew:

10:10.062 --> 10:12.530
that the smell of death was upon it.

10:23.576 --> 10:27.239
The desert does not forgive man
his weakness.

10:27.313 --> 10:32.842
Weak or strong, it takes no mercy,
and can kill a man in less than a day.

10:36.856 --> 10:41.190
To survive, one must develop skin like leather,

10:41.260 --> 10:45.356
know where to find water
and when to take shelter.

10:59.378 --> 11:04.281
The FBl man would have surely died
had he not stayed underground,

11:04.350 --> 11:07.751
protected like the jack rabbit or the fox.

11:08.254 --> 11:11.018
Even so, death was near.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.586
ln accordance with our ancient traditions,

11:15.695 --> 11:19.461
we put four oak twigs
on the beams of the hogan

11:19.532 --> 11:24.469
to summon the Holy People
and tell them that a ceremony will be held.

11:25.638 --> 11:28.266
lt is called the Blessing Way chant.

11:29.241 --> 11:33.143
Only the Holy People
can save the FBl man's life now.

11:33.713 --> 11:36.045
He is in their hands.

12:24.196 --> 12:25.322
Frohike.

12:25.398 --> 12:28.333
l know it's late, but l heard the news.

12:32.271 --> 12:35.798
Maybe l should go.
Pardon my presumptuousness.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.435
How much have you had to drink?

12:41.013 --> 12:43.004
Do you recycle?

12:44.583 --> 12:48.485
He was a good friend.
A redwood among mere sprouts.

12:53.659 --> 12:57.060
l guess this means
he's passing you the torch.

12:57.730 --> 13:02.064
l'm afraid not. l'm soon to be out of ajob.

13:02.701 --> 13:04.965
Those sons of bitches.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.868
They're rigging the game.

13:07.940 --> 13:12.206
And, like rats, they just
scatter back into the woodpile.

13:17.216 --> 13:19.776
- The rats that killed the cat.
- What's this?

13:20.386 --> 13:24.186
lt's a news item about Kenneth Soona,
aka The Thinker.

13:24.256 --> 13:27.919
The man who hacked the MJ files.
The ones he gave to Mulder.

13:28.494 --> 13:31.554
''Kenneth J Soona
was killed execution-style

13:31.664 --> 13:34.565
in what appears to be a professional murder,

13:34.667 --> 13:37.158
his body found in the Trenton city landfill.''

13:38.137 --> 13:40.401
What's the date on this?

13:40.506 --> 13:45.273
This was the day before yesterday.
This is after Mulder disappeared.

13:45.344 --> 13:47.938
Could they be so stupid?

13:50.416 --> 13:53.476
This healing ritual called the Blessing Way

13:53.552 --> 13:57.886
has been passed down
by our ancient Navajo ancestors.

13:57.957 --> 14:03.827
lts songs and prayers must be followed
just as they have been for centuries.

14:03.896 --> 14:06.922
Or the Holy People will not be summoned.

14:09.869 --> 14:13.361
l watched my father perform
the chants as a young boy

14:13.472 --> 14:15.963
and saw their healing magic.

14:19.778 --> 14:25.614
But my fear for the FBl man was that
his spirit did not want to be healed.

14:26.185 --> 14:30.144
That it wished to join the spirit
of his own father who had died

14:30.222 --> 14:34.249
and did not want to return
to the world of the living.

14:36.996 --> 14:41.990
His body has become tired and weak,
and it searches for rest.

14:58.918 --> 15:01.614
lf the struggle to continue is too hard

15:01.687 --> 15:05.589
or the wish to join his ancestors too strong,

15:05.658 --> 15:07.819
the body will give up.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.694
But if the desire to resume life
burns brightly enough,

15:12.765 --> 15:15.825
the Holy People will be merciful.

15:16.302 --> 15:21.467
The days and nights now will be long
and dicult for the FBl man

15:21.540 --> 15:25.567
as the Holy People come
and help him to choose.

15:27.880 --> 15:32.112
l was first struck by the absence of time,

15:32.217 --> 15:37.553
having depended on it so completely
as a measure of myself and my life.

15:38.824 --> 15:44.922
Moving backwards into the perpetual night,
it consumes purpose and deed,

15:44.997 --> 15:47.693
all passion and will.

15:50.903 --> 15:54.600
l come to you, old friend,
with the dull clarity of the dead,

15:54.673 --> 15:57.198
not to beckon you,

15:57.276 --> 16:01.212
but to feel the fire and intensity

16:01.313 --> 16:03.838
that still live in you.

16:03.949 --> 16:08.181
And the heavy weight of your burdens,
which l had once borne.

16:08.253 --> 16:12.690
There is truth, you know, friend,
if that's all you seek.

16:12.758 --> 16:18.321
But there's no justice orjudgment,
without which truth is a vast,

16:19.198 --> 16:20.665
dead,

16:21.367 --> 16:22.834
hollow.

16:23.969 --> 16:28.838
Go back. Do not look into the abyss
or let the abyss look into you.

16:28.941 --> 16:34.379
Awaken the sleep of reason, and fight
the monsters within and without.

17:06.377 --> 17:08.107
Hello, son.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.944
l did not dare hope to see you so soon.

17:12.017 --> 17:15.953
Or ever again hope to broker fate

17:17.388 --> 17:19.448
with a life to which l gave life.

17:22.461 --> 17:25.259
The lies l told you

17:25.329 --> 17:27.798
were a pox and poison to my soul.

17:27.866 --> 17:31.529
And now you are here because of them.

17:31.637 --> 17:37.132
Lies l thought might bury forever
a truth l could not live with.

17:38.143 --> 17:43.206
l stand here, ashamed of the choices
l made so long ago

17:43.315 --> 17:45.783
when you were just a boy.

17:46.985 --> 17:49.783
You are the memory, Fox.

17:49.855 --> 17:52.119
lt lives in you.

17:53.225 --> 17:55.921
lf you were to die now,

17:56.495 --> 17:58.725
the truth will die.

17:59.264 --> 18:01.323
And only the lies survive us.

18:03.569 --> 18:05.560
My sister...

18:06.572 --> 18:08.199
ls she here?

18:08.273 --> 18:10.173
No.

18:10.242 --> 18:13.040
The thing that would destroy me,

18:13.145 --> 18:16.171
the truth l felt you must never learn,

18:16.715 --> 18:19.343
is the truth you will find

18:20.986 --> 18:22.851
if you are to go forward.

18:45.911 --> 18:49.711
OK, step through the metal detector
and we'll begin the tour.

18:50.249 --> 18:53.150
This facility is the J Edgar Hoover Building.

18:53.218 --> 18:57.882
lt was finished in 1974 and built on
the site of the original FBl headquarters.

18:57.990 --> 19:02.723
There's a display on the ''Ten Most Wanted.''
You might see a few of your relatives there!

19:02.795 --> 19:06.754
lf you have any questions,
l'll do my best to answer them.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.934
Makin' you come in the front door
these days, Agent Scully?

19:11.003 --> 19:12.561
For now.

19:15.007 --> 19:17.567
- Are you carrying your weapon?
- No.

19:19.011 --> 19:22.708
- Sorry to have to run you through this.
- That's OK.

19:24.716 --> 19:25.910
That was weird.

19:25.984 --> 19:31.616
l've had a stray pin left in a shirt collar set
this machine off. But you can go on through.

19:32.491 --> 19:34.049
Thank you.

19:37.462 --> 19:39.453
Scully, come in, please.

19:47.039 --> 19:50.304
You said you needed to see me
concerning the investigation?

19:50.409 --> 19:52.070
Yes, sir.

19:52.144 --> 19:56.877
l came across a news article. A man's body
was found and l have reason to believe

19:56.949 --> 20:00.544
he was killed by the same man
responsible for Agent Mulder.

20:00.619 --> 20:02.348
Can l see it?

20:04.156 --> 20:07.387
The date of death postdates
Agent Mulder's disappearance.

20:07.459 --> 20:11.862
Now you already have the ballistics data
from Agent Mulder's father on file.

20:11.964 --> 20:15.058
l'd like you to run it against
the ballistics from this man's case.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.325
To try and prove what?

20:17.402 --> 20:21.304
Well, if both men were killed by the same
weapon, Mulder didn't kill his father.

20:21.406 --> 20:24.273
And it could help us find the men who did.

20:24.376 --> 20:27.106
You've been relieved of
your investigative function.

20:27.212 --> 20:31.444
Yes, l know that, sir.
l just thought this might be helpful.

20:33.085 --> 20:34.848
l'm afraid not.

20:35.587 --> 20:40.684
This case would have been handled by
the Trenton PD. They're on our database.

20:40.759 --> 20:43.853
lf there was a match on the two slugs,
we'd know by now.

20:43.929 --> 20:46.295
You don't wanna check?

20:46.365 --> 20:51.302
Miss Scully, l think you underestimate the
duties and responsibilities of my position

20:51.370 --> 20:53.702
as Assistant Director.

20:56.708 --> 20:59.541
l was trying to cooperate
with your investigation.

20:59.645 --> 21:02.079
And enhance your chances of reinstatement.

21:02.180 --> 21:06.048
- No. l just want answers.
- And so do l.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.920
l wanna know why l was asked to execute
a search warrant on your apartment

21:12.024 --> 21:14.219
to look for a digital cassette.

21:14.293 --> 21:15.282
l don't have it.

21:15.394 --> 21:18.192
ls this tape what Agent Mulder died for?

21:18.263 --> 21:19.787
l believe so.

21:19.865 --> 21:24.529
You wanna bring me a smoking gun,
Scully, you bring me this tape.

21:25.003 --> 21:29.997
Otherwise l would ask you to go home,
sit tight, and let us do ourjob.

21:33.679 --> 21:35.840
ls that all, sir?

21:38.317 --> 21:39.682
Yes, that's all.

21:57.069 --> 21:59.594
Did you ask her about the tape?

22:00.238 --> 22:02.229
She says she doesn't have it.

22:02.341 --> 22:04.206
ls that what she says?

22:05.510 --> 22:07.205
Yes, that's what she says.

22:09.781 --> 22:12.477
Well, that's unfortunate for everyone.

22:27.899 --> 22:28.888
Back again?

22:29.001 --> 22:32.198
l'm curious about something.
Can l go through here again?

22:32.270 --> 22:34.204
Come on through.

22:40.512 --> 22:43.276
This thing is more sensitive than a toothache.

22:43.348 --> 22:47.182
Would you mind running the wand
over me one more time?

22:47.252 --> 22:48.651
Sure.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.891
- Are you wearing a necklace or somethin'?
- No. Not today.

22:58.964 --> 23:01.023
Then what the hell is that?

23:13.345 --> 23:18.647
- What do you think it could be?
- l don't know. lt's embedded in soft tissue.

23:18.884 --> 23:20.818
Looks like maybe a piece of buckshot.

23:21.686 --> 23:24.177
l don't know how it could've gotten there.

23:26.691 --> 23:29.159
l can feel itjust under the skin.

23:29.227 --> 23:32.788
And now that l'm looking at it closely,
there's a tiny scar over it.

23:32.898 --> 23:36.493
lf you want, l could do a local
and pull it out of there.

23:37.469 --> 23:38.697
Yeah.

23:43.842 --> 23:46.140
Thanks for coming down here so late.

23:46.211 --> 23:51.808
No problem. You were probably wounded
in the line of duty and didn't even know it.

24:00.926 --> 24:05.420
For three days the Blessing Way chant
was performed.

24:05.497 --> 24:08.432
The FBl man suffered great fevers

24:08.500 --> 24:11.060
and his body burned like fire.

24:11.136 --> 24:13.832
There was doubt that he would recover.

24:14.406 --> 24:17.102
But the spirits were in attendance.

24:17.175 --> 24:22.772
Because, on the night of the third day,
he opened his eyes and asked for water.

24:27.686 --> 24:32.214
The ritual bath must be given
outside the hogan before sunrise.

24:33.158 --> 24:37.959
The FBl man was weak from his journey
and did not wish to speak.

24:38.563 --> 24:42.260
But, like a rising sun, l sensed in him a rebirth.

24:43.702 --> 24:47.798
Still, it will take time to regain his strength.

24:54.746 --> 24:58.147
Well, it's definitely not buckshot.

24:59.784 --> 25:01.945
l know what it looks like to me,

25:02.020 --> 25:06.616
but l couldn't tell you how it got there.
Take a look.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.327
lt looks like a computer chip.

25:18.336 --> 25:20.736
That's what it looks like.

25:22.007 --> 25:25.374
l don't even know how long it's been in there.

25:25.443 --> 25:29.174
l have absolutely no recollection
of it being put there.

25:29.247 --> 25:31.238
God, it's frightening.

25:32.450 --> 25:35.510
Dana, this is very serious.
You gotta find out what this is.

25:36.354 --> 25:39.084
l don't have access to the FBl labs.

25:39.991 --> 25:42.687
l'm talking about access
to your own memory.

25:42.761 --> 25:45.787
You've buried this so deeply,
you can't consciously recall it.

25:45.897 --> 25:47.592
- Melissa...
- l know someone...

25:47.899 --> 25:49.298
No!

25:54.072 --> 25:58.839
What are you so afraid of, Dana? That you
might learn something about yourself?

25:58.910 --> 26:03.176
You're so shut off to the possibility
there could be any other explanation

26:03.248 --> 26:06.581
except for your rigid,
scientific view of the world.

26:06.651 --> 26:10.610
lt's like you've lost all touch
with your own intuition.

26:11.323 --> 26:17.125
You carry so much grief and fear that you've
built up walls around your true feelings

26:17.229 --> 26:20.255
and the memory of what really happened.

26:21.466 --> 26:24.867
Just do this for me, as your sister.

26:24.936 --> 26:26.927
Please.

26:36.581 --> 26:38.913
l'll induce a non-ordinary state,

26:38.984 --> 26:43.683
a modified form of hypnosis
which involves Holotropic Breathwork.

26:43.755 --> 26:47.555
This will quiet your interpretive mind
so we can cut through the interference

26:47.626 --> 26:49.821
with your memories and perceptions.

26:49.928 --> 26:54.092
Now, what l want you to do
is to maintain a focus on your breath.

26:55.233 --> 26:57.224
Relax your breathing.

26:58.236 --> 27:00.796
Now l want you to close your eyes,

27:00.872 --> 27:06.777
and think of a place where you've
always felt comfortable and safe.

27:06.845 --> 27:12.010
You told me of your experience
of being taken away and losing time.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.745
Do you remember how you felt
just before this happened?

27:15.253 --> 27:17.244
l was afraid.

27:18.490 --> 27:21.357
Do you remember what you were afraid of?

27:25.430 --> 27:27.364
That l would die.

27:27.432 --> 27:29.423
But you didn't die.

27:29.634 --> 27:34.662
Someone must have cared for you.
Do you remember who that someone was?

27:34.739 --> 27:36.730
There were men.

27:38.576 --> 27:40.567
A man took me.

27:43.148 --> 27:45.673
There was a light and...

27:47.552 --> 27:50.043
loud sounds. My...

27:51.890 --> 27:56.122
- My ears were pounding.
- They performed a procedure on you.

27:56.528 --> 27:59.895
- Do you remember any pain during this?
- l'm trying.

28:02.534 --> 28:05.002
The sound is all screwed up.

28:07.872 --> 28:10.340
There was an alarm.

28:11.743 --> 28:13.734
l remember...

28:16.281 --> 28:19.045
They wanted to know if l was all right.

28:19.150 --> 28:23.484
Maybe you trusted them not to hurt you.
Could this be possible?

28:25.557 --> 28:27.821
l don't know.

28:27.892 --> 28:32.556
At the FBl you work with people
you must entrust with your life.

28:32.630 --> 28:35.497
Could it have been one of these people?

28:35.600 --> 28:38.000
l had to trust them.

28:40.872 --> 28:42.999
l was powerless.

28:46.878 --> 28:48.869
l couldn't...

28:51.149 --> 28:53.242
l could not resist them.

28:54.018 --> 28:59.752
lf this is too painful, l want you to go back
to that comfortable place where we began

28:59.824 --> 29:01.257
and try again.

29:03.928 --> 29:05.691
l'm sorry.

29:06.598 --> 29:08.589
l'm trying, l'm trying.

29:11.236 --> 29:14.034
l don't think this is working.

29:14.672 --> 29:17.698
l don't think we're getting anywhere.

29:19.711 --> 29:22.908
Thank you, but you'll have to excuse me.

30:03.888 --> 30:07.722
You must be careful now
to end the ceremony properly.

30:07.826 --> 30:14.129
lf you leave, you must not do any work,
change clothes, or bathe for four days.

30:15.366 --> 30:17.766
That's gonna cut into my social life.

30:20.305 --> 30:22.796
The boys have a gift for you.

30:39.190 --> 30:42.591
You asked for them during your worst fevers.

30:46.798 --> 30:51.064
During my fever, l left here
and traveled to a place.

30:51.469 --> 30:56.429
This place. You carry it with you.
lt is inside of you.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.441
lt is the origin place.

30:58.543 --> 31:00.067
lt wasn't a dream?

31:00.512 --> 31:01.979
Yes.

31:20.899 --> 31:22.594
We are done now.

31:43.688 --> 31:45.087
Skinner.

31:45.189 --> 31:47.987
You came to see me today.

31:48.059 --> 31:48.957
Excuse me?

31:49.394 --> 31:53.660
You came to my apartment.
l assume you wanted to see me.

31:53.765 --> 31:57.633
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- l saw you come out of my building.

31:58.036 --> 32:01.005
You've obviously made a mistake. l'm sorry.

32:08.479 --> 32:11.346
l need some air. Excuse me.

32:19.924 --> 32:23.087
l have been on the bridge
that spans two worlds,

32:23.161 --> 32:28.155
the link between all souls by which
we cross into our own true nature.

32:29.500 --> 32:33.129
You were here today, looking for
a truth that was taken from you.

32:33.204 --> 32:36.640
A truth which was never to be spoken
but which now binds us together

32:36.741 --> 32:38.971
in dangerous purpose.

32:39.444 --> 32:42.379
l have returned from the dead
to continue with you.

32:42.447 --> 32:47.248
But l fear that this danger is now
close at hand. That l may be too late.

33:01.199 --> 33:04.691
So we are here to mourn
the passing of William Mulder.

33:04.802 --> 33:07.270
To join in our grief for our loss.

33:07.372 --> 33:11.832
To share also the memories of a man
whose life was rich and full,

33:12.410 --> 33:17.677
and who made his family's and his
friends' lives richer and fuller as well.

33:17.749 --> 33:22.152
Sadly, l've been informed today
by the mother of William's children

33:22.220 --> 33:27.317
that his son, Fox, could not be here
to join us in this time of sorrow.

33:36.134 --> 33:38.295
- Mrs Mulder?
- Yes.

33:38.369 --> 33:41.133
l'm Dana Scully. l work with your son.

33:43.007 --> 33:46.272
l know what you may have heard
from the FBl,

33:46.344 --> 33:49.871
but l have a strong feeling
your son is going to be found.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.414
Oh, my goodness gracious!

33:51.516 --> 33:54.610
- l think he's still alive.
- How do you know?

33:56.487 --> 33:59.285
l just have a very strong feeling.

34:15.406 --> 34:20.434
- l'll let you know as soon as l do.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

34:30.888 --> 34:32.549
Hello.

34:32.623 --> 34:35.420
l see you're a friend of the family.

34:35.493 --> 34:37.188
So am l.

34:37.261 --> 34:39.592
Do you think we might speak?

34:39.664 --> 34:42.827
- About?
- A very serious matter.

34:43.568 --> 34:47.264
Please, can we find someplace
away from the others?

34:52.310 --> 34:55.279
l couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.

34:55.379 --> 34:58.974
- You think the son is still alive?
- Who are you?

34:59.050 --> 35:03.419
l'm a member of a kind of consortium.
We represent certain global interests.

35:03.521 --> 35:05.011
What kind of interests?

35:05.123 --> 35:10.652
lnterests that would be threatened by the tape
you are no longer in possession of.

35:10.728 --> 35:12.958
- Threatened enough to murder?
- Yes.

35:15.032 --> 35:19.196
- What do you know about Mulder?
- That he is dead. Cui bono.

35:19.270 --> 35:21.704
- You're lying.
- l'm not here to tell you lies.

35:21.806 --> 35:26.243
- What are you here for?
- To tell you your life is in danger too.

35:27.211 --> 35:30.669
- Leave me alone.
- They'll kill you one of two ways.

35:32.650 --> 35:35.210
They'll send someone, possibly two men.

35:35.319 --> 35:40.416
They'll kill you at home with an unregistered
weapon, which will be left at the scene.

35:40.525 --> 35:43.619
Using false documents,
supplied by associates of mine,

35:43.728 --> 35:47.129
they'll be out of the country
in less than two hours.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.997
- You said there were two ways.
- Yes.

35:51.068 --> 35:55.835
He, or she, will be someone close to you.
Someone you trust.

35:56.207 --> 35:59.199
They'll arrange a meeting or come
to your house unexpectedly.

35:59.977 --> 36:03.140
Do you have someplace else
you might stay?

36:03.781 --> 36:07.512
- Why? Why kill me?
- You want something they don't.

36:07.585 --> 36:09.143
Justice.

36:09.253 --> 36:14.782
And because they are now certain you don't
have the copy of the files they're looking for.

36:14.859 --> 36:17.123
Why are you protecting me?

36:17.662 --> 36:21.928
l feel my colleagues are acting impulsively.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.930
Your death will draw unnecessary
attention to our group.

36:27.305 --> 36:31.241
- You're protecting yourself.
- Why should that surprise you?

36:31.309 --> 36:34.574
Motives are rarely unselfish.

36:34.912 --> 36:38.905
- What kind of business are you in?
- We predict the future.

36:39.417 --> 36:41.885
The best way to predict the future

36:41.953 --> 36:43.750
is to invent it.

36:46.090 --> 36:47.887
Good day, young lady.

37:13.618 --> 37:15.313
Mom...

37:16.821 --> 37:18.846
My God!

37:19.190 --> 37:20.987
Fox!

37:22.460 --> 37:25.554
l can't believe it. l'd expected the worst.

37:25.663 --> 37:29.121
l need your help, Mom.
l don't have much time.

37:29.233 --> 37:32.896
- They said something terrible had happened.
- l'm OK.

37:32.970 --> 37:36.565
But l need your help. l need you to remember.

37:37.675 --> 37:39.973
l need to know more about Dad.

37:41.746 --> 37:43.737
Who these people are.

37:46.284 --> 37:48.218
lt was all so long ago.

37:48.286 --> 37:50.720
l need you to try to remember, Mom.

37:50.821 --> 37:54.052
These pictures were taken in 1972. Where?

37:55.526 --> 37:57.619
l don't know.

37:58.262 --> 38:01.425
Dad worked for the State Department.
He'd go on the road. Where?

38:01.499 --> 38:05.435
- l don't remember, Fox.
- Look at the pictures, Mom.

38:05.503 --> 38:07.300
- Don't do this to me.
- Look at them!

38:07.371 --> 38:11.865
He must have talked about the men
he worked with. Were they ever here?

38:13.144 --> 38:14.270
Yes.

38:15.313 --> 38:18.908
But l don't remember their names anymore.

38:18.983 --> 38:21.144
What does this have to do with, Fox?

38:25.523 --> 38:28.048
l think it has to do with Samantha.

38:29.460 --> 38:33.226
l think it has to do with
what happened to my sister.

38:45.042 --> 38:45.770
Hello?

38:45.843 --> 38:49.836
Dana, it's your sister. Where have you been?

38:49.914 --> 38:53.543
l had to go to Boston, for a funeral.

38:54.251 --> 38:57.049
- l was worried about you.
- Why?

38:57.121 --> 39:00.716
l haven't heard from you
since you saw Dr Pomerantz.

39:01.392 --> 39:04.953
Missy, something strange
happened to me today.

39:05.062 --> 39:07.792
l'm a bit freaked out by it.

39:07.898 --> 39:10.890
l'll come over.
Are you gonna be there for a while?

39:10.968 --> 39:11.935
Yeah, l will.

39:12.003 --> 39:13.994
OK. l'll see you in a bit.

39:22.079 --> 39:23.171
Hi.

39:47.071 --> 39:49.062
Come on, come on, come on!

39:56.447 --> 39:57.880
Hi. This is Melissa.

39:57.982 --> 40:01.577
Sorry to have missed your call.
Leave a message and l'll call you back.

40:01.652 --> 40:03.051
Have a really nice day.

40:04.021 --> 40:06.649
Missy, it's me. Please pick up.

40:08.726 --> 40:09.920
Missy?

40:10.494 --> 40:12.485
Missy, pick up...

40:13.064 --> 40:17.694
l'm coming over to your place instead.
l'll look for you on the way. Bye.

40:51.068 --> 40:53.093
Scully, get in the car.

40:53.904 --> 40:58.500
- l need to talk to you. lt's very important.
- l was going to my sister's.

40:58.609 --> 41:01.043
l'll drop you there.
l need you to come with me.

41:01.145 --> 41:05.104
- Where are we going?
- To a place we can talk in private.

41:24.602 --> 41:26.229
After you.

41:32.510 --> 41:34.102
Eyes forward.

41:34.178 --> 41:36.669
Put your hands where l can see them.

41:36.747 --> 41:39.409
Don't turn around or l'll blow your head off.

41:43.053 --> 41:48.514
- Don't think l won't do it, you son of a bitch.
- l believe you. Just stay cool. l'm with you.

41:48.592 --> 41:50.583
Take two steps forward.
