00:06.610 --> 00:07.406
What are you doing?

00:08.211 --> 00:09.454
Well, I'm gardening.

00:09.859 --> 00:10.828
What are you doing?

00:10.966 --> 00:12.250
I'm gardening.

00:12.619 --> 00:13.592
What are you doing?

00:13.724 --> 00:16.551
Why don't you come over here and see, honey, since you seem so confused?

00:16.818 --> 00:19.146
Oh, my God. You are gardening.

00:19.546 --> 00:21.767
Yeah. Hello. I am gardening.

00:22.051 --> 00:22.578
Why?

00:22.762 --> 00:24.549
Because Babette bought me a bag of bulbs.

00:24.686 --> 00:25.603
Why would she do that?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.891
She thought that cultivating new life would help distract me

00:28.983 --> 00:30.914
from my current emptiness and sense of loss.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.708
Well, that's weirdly sweet of her.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.811
Yes, it was. Anyhow, I forgot about the bulbs 'til Babette brought them up this morning,

00:36.892 --> 00:38.070
so I dug them out of the garage.

00:38.286 --> 00:40.498
Where they've developed some sort of mold.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.283
- This is the planet of the mold. 
- Help me.

00:43.634 --> 00:47.338
Mom, I'm no botanist, but I don't think anything's gonna grow from this piece of tar.

00:47.517 --> 00:48.642
Just put it in the hole and cover it up.

00:48.787 --> 00:49.990
Why didn't you just throw them out?

00:50.456 --> 00:53.846
- There are eyes everywhere, my dear. 
- Hey, doll, how you doing?

00:53.953 --> 00:56.467
Great, Babette. Just tending my bulbs.

00:56.677 --> 00:59.580
- Makes you feel better, doesn't it? 
- Absolutely, much better.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.986
- You need any help? 
- Oh, no. I got Rory helping me.

01:02.124 --> 01:03.476
- Hi, Babette. 
- Hi, sugar.

01:03.645 --> 01:06.564
- Don't worry, I'm looking out for your mom. 
- I'm glad to hear that.

01:06.772 --> 01:08.724
Oh, and just you wait 'til spring.

01:08.914 --> 01:12.319
You're gonna wake up one morning, walk out, and pow,

01:12.559 --> 01:16.664
color coming out of your yin-yang! I'll see you girls tomorrow.

01:16.808 --> 01:18.832
I'm going to have color coming out of my yin-yang.

01:18.944 --> 01:20.615
Well, then maybe you'll finally get a man.

01:21.775 --> 01:24.848
This has got to be the grossest thing ever.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.432
Forget about the bulbs. Let's talk about something else. How's school?

01:27.637 --> 01:29.748
School's fine. It's hard but good.

01:30.265 --> 01:35.026
Tanna's fine. Janet and Paris are fighting because Janet gets up at 5:30 to go jogging,

01:35.160 --> 01:39.251
wakes Paris up, and then the resulting argument wakes everybody up, and - oh!

01:39.973 --> 01:42.153
Oh, my God! You bulbed me! You bulbed me!

01:42.274 --> 01:45.016
- I was aiming over there. 
- Oh, it got my hand! It got my hand!

01:45.215 --> 01:47.124
- Shake it off. Shake it off. 
- Oh, it won't go! It won't go!

01:48.509 --> 01:50.090
You wiped it on my shirt.

01:50.546 --> 01:51.451
It was a reflex.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.464
- To ruin my shirt? 
- I'm sorry.

01:53.601 --> 01:56.050
- You never liked this shirt. 
- It's not that. It's just that...

01:57.705 --> 01:59.765
- There's something crawling up my leg! 
- Oh no, oh no! I got it, I got it.

01:59.890 --> 02:02.275
- There's something crawling up my leg! 
- I got it, I got it! It's big!

02:05.778 --> 02:10.965
Okay, so the next time that Babette gives you a bag of bulbs to plant

02:11.030 --> 02:12.608
because you're lonely, you say...

02:13.642 --> 02:15.612
- No, thank you. 
- Class dismissed.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.059 --> 03:12.132
- You could at least open a window. 
- Why?

03:12.308 --> 03:15.076
- Because it smells like a locker room in here! 
- Tough luck!

03:15.169 --> 03:15.723
Fine!

03:18.278 --> 03:19.997
- Did the alarm go off? 
- I shut it off.

03:20.259 --> 03:22.316
Who needs an alarm when you've got Workout Barbie around?

03:22.619 --> 03:26.612
Never mind that some of us were up finishing a chem lab 'til 2:30 in the morning!

03:27.032 --> 03:29.966
I for one love waking up at five a.m. to the sound of someone

03:30.033 --> 03:31.482
grunting out crunches in the common room!

03:31.727 --> 03:33.816
I told you - earplugs.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.049
You know, she talks to herself when she stretches.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.014
"Come on, Janet. Push it, Janet. Love the pain, Janet."

03:39.223 --> 03:40.611
- It's pornographic. 
- What time is it?

03:40.836 --> 03:43.104
I know what she's doing. It's psychological warfare.

03:43.242 --> 03:45.377
Don't let your enemy sleep. Push him 'til he cracks.

03:45.536 --> 03:48.603
Charlie tried the same tricks on our boys at Khe Sanh, and let me tell you,

03:48.725 --> 03:51.454
if she keeps this up, I am not gonna be responsible for what happens.

03:51.603 --> 03:55.659
Oh, my God! Paris, breakfast is over in five minutes!

03:55.745 --> 03:58.009
I know. It's Tuesday, too. That's waffle bar day.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.759
Why didn't you wake me?

03:59.857 --> 04:02.586
Oh, sure, blame me. I'm the victim here, remember?

04:12.149 --> 04:14.806
Excuse me, excuse me. Can I... Yes, thank you.

04:27.259 --> 04:28.421
- Rory. 
- Marty.

04:28.708 --> 04:29.373
You remembered.

04:29.523 --> 04:32.189
Well, I wasn't the one passed out in the hallway, so I had a better shot.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.774
True, very true. So, I see you're a little late for breakfast.

04:35.939 --> 04:37.504
Yeah. My alarm was turned off.

04:38.093 --> 04:39.501
Hey, you want some eggs or something?

04:39.844 --> 04:41.877
I always take enough for ten. I blame my brother.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.555
- He always took the biggest piece of chicken. 
- And left you none?

04:44.719 --> 04:47.295
No, there was plenty more. I just really wanted that big piece.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.476
Oh. Well...

04:48.661 --> 04:51.692
- Hey, I want you to meet The Breakfast Crew. 
- Oh, well, I'm kind of...

04:51.861 --> 04:54.631
Well, we all just started eating breakfast together every morning,

04:54.718 --> 04:57.057
so someone came up with the name The Breakfast Crew.

04:57.242 --> 04:59.654
I mean, it's not like an official club or anything. There's no hats.

04:59.904 --> 05:01.758
At least not until we can all agree on a color.

05:02.004 --> 05:04.819
Excuse me, guys. I want you all to meet Rory.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.453
- Who? 
- The robe.

05:06.627 --> 05:10.576
- Oh, the robe. Nice to meet you. 
- I told them about your act of kindness.

05:10.693 --> 05:14.241
- Oh, it was nothing, really. 
- I wouldn't say that. That was one nice robe.

05:14.389 --> 05:18.133
- We all took turns trying it on. 
- Not true. Ignore him.

05:18.332 --> 05:20.728
- I'm sorry I haven't gotten it back to you yet. 
- Oh, it's okay.

05:21.036 --> 05:22.766
- Nice bunny shoes. 
- Thank you.

05:22.929 --> 05:25.419
It was nice meeting you all. I actually have to go, so...

05:25.976 --> 05:28.008
- I embarrassed you. 
- It's fine.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.178
 I'm sorry. I was just so relieved that I could finally approach you.

05:31.512 --> 05:32.468
Why couldn't you approach me?

05:32.720 --> 05:36.155
Well, that night was really humiliating, so every time I saw you after that,

05:36.248 --> 05:39.401
I just hid. But then when I saw you show up this morning like that,

05:39.539 --> 05:42.099
I thought, here's my chance to even the playing field.

05:42.756 --> 05:45.398
Marty, this is not as embarrassing as being totally naked.

05:45.724 --> 05:48.244
No, it's not. But it's close

05:49.785 --> 05:53.281
Well, consider the playing field leveled.

05:54.106 --> 05:56.088
Good. See ya, Rory.

05:56.363 --> 05:57.040
See ya, Marty.

05:57.977 --> 06:00.490
Exactly, yes, that's just the kind of thing we're looking for.

06:01.924 --> 06:06.839
Well, I'm so glad to hear that because the last three designers we met with

06:06.931 --> 06:09.179
had very different philosophies.

06:11.094 --> 06:14.356
No, I didn't know you did the Silver Thatch Inn. Oh, that was so beautiful.

06:15.528 --> 06:16.163
Yeah.

06:17.506 --> 06:20.987
Okay. Well, why don't we meet Friday,

06:21.156 --> 06:22.251
say, around two o'clock?

06:23.756 --> 06:27.233
Okay. Luke's Diner. It's right in the middle of the town square.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.224
You can't miss it. Just follow the love.

06:30.162 --> 06:31.185
Okay. Thank you.

06:31.856 --> 06:32.624
Bye-bye.

06:33.229 --> 06:34.763
- What was that? 
- I was taking it outside.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.607
Three people came in while you held the door open.

06:36.858 --> 06:39.648
- You're exaggerating. 
- Why can't you respect the rules of my diner?

06:39.803 --> 06:43.077
I do respect the rules of your diner. It's that baseball cap I have issues with.

06:45.265 --> 06:49.546
All right, I've done extensive research, checked references,

06:49.623 --> 06:53.258
and prescreened three other designers for you. Here are their names.

06:53.418 --> 06:56.504
Well, hopefully I won't need these. I think I just found a new designer for the inn.

06:56.653 --> 07:00.134
Well, good. I love doing research just for the sake of doing research.

07:00.206 --> 07:02.085
I live to grow. Are you still buying me lunch?

07:02.178 --> 07:04.783
I'd be happy to buy you lunch, but I should probably take you somewhere else.

07:04.901 --> 07:06.114
Why should you take him somewhere else?

07:06.221 --> 07:08.792
Because, Kook Danes, Michel eats a very specific diet.

07:08.926 --> 07:12.699
Normally, yes, that's true. However, every six months I give myself a crazy day

07:12.786 --> 07:16.385
where I can eat anything I want, and today's crazy day.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.797
- Talk to me about your chocolate cake. 
- What do you want to know?

07:18.899 --> 07:20.655
- Is it Mexican? 
- Is what Mexican?

07:20.737 --> 07:22.498
- The chocolate. 
- How would I know?

07:22.600 --> 07:24.684
It would say so on the wrapper. You could go look.

07:27.133 --> 07:27.905
I'll wait.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.894
Take him somewhere else.

07:32.293 --> 07:35.846
Oh, just bring me a doughnut, but put some sprinkles on it, okay?

07:35.974 --> 07:38.770
Do you know what one of life's great mysteries is?

07:38.857 --> 07:41.985
Whether or not you're going to be joining us for Friday night dinner.

07:42.918 --> 07:47.208
And since you pretend to be ignorant of the concept of the RSVP even

07:47.321 --> 07:48.831
though I know it was taught to you as a child,

07:49.025 --> 07:52.035
I am reduced to calling and asking you, are you coming?

07:52.570 --> 07:55.399
Is that "uh huh, yes, I'm coming"

07:55.655 --> 07:58.107
or "uh huh, I was reading while you were talking"?

07:58.303 --> 08:00.755
Tell you what, Mom - plan on me coming,

08:00.858 --> 08:03.806
and if I don't, then it'll just be a little more for everyone else.

08:03.976 --> 08:06.797
Lorelai, you know very well our dinners do not work like that.

08:07.079 --> 08:09.747
There is careful planning and shopping and preparation

08:09.834 --> 08:13.377
that goes into every meal no matter how boring and simple it may seem to you.

08:13.587 --> 08:14.365
Oh, Mom...

08:15.286 --> 08:16.326
Hey, what...

08:17.108 --> 08:19.889
- Get off that phone! 
- Oh, shoot, Mom, there's no cell phones in here.

08:19.976 --> 08:21.174
I'll call you back later. Bye.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.180
And when I need you - nowhere.

08:25.066 --> 08:29.263
It's obvious Hemingway is just using Jake's impotence to indict a society

08:29.340 --> 08:33.340
which exploited its underclass to fight in the trenches of the first World War.

08:33.482 --> 08:34.669
Interesting theory, Heather.

08:34.988 --> 08:36.159
What does everyone else think?

08:36.799 --> 08:39.167
I don't know. I mean, isn't Jake's impotence more about

08:39.288 --> 08:41.265
that generation's loss of faith in love?

08:41.972 --> 08:45.186
Please. That grossly ignores the social context.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.470
Rory's right. The book's about a guy who can't sleep with the woman he loves.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.232
- It's not some Woody Guthrie song. 
- But...

08:49.349 --> 08:51.100
Okay, hold that thought, Heather. We're out of time.

08:51.285 --> 08:55.007
Okay, everyone, we'll continue this Thursday. I'll see you all then.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.809
- Thanks for the save. 
- No problem.

08:57.051 --> 08:59.632
Heather can get a little "workers of the world, unite" sometimes.

08:59.757 --> 09:02.365
Yeah, I've never actually met someone who likes the word bourgeois so much.

09:03.721 --> 09:05.069
So, what are you up to this weekend?

09:05.395 --> 09:08.570
Oh, studying. Sleep, hopefully. A rarity in my dorm room.

09:08.764 --> 09:10.736
- Yeah? Do you eat? 
- Habitually.

09:10.946 --> 09:12.907
Ever been to Pancia di Lucca? I hear it's good.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.090
No, I haven't.

09:14.505 --> 09:17.663
- I was thinking of going there this weekend. 
- Oh, cool. Tell me how it is.

09:17.812 --> 09:21.254
Okay, I will. Or, hey, you could come with me.

09:21.586 --> 09:24.350
I can't this Saturday, but if it's good, maybe another time, okay?

09:24.494 --> 09:27.453
Sure, okay. So, see you next week.

09:27.641 --> 09:28.385
Bye, Trevor.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.539
Hey, what are you doing home?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.837
Well, it seems that if you leave your laundry in the machine

09:38.021 --> 09:42.050
for even two minutes after it stops, some incredibly impatient person will come

09:42.132 --> 09:44.073
and take your nice clean clothes out and dump them.

09:44.124 --> 09:45.000
- Where? 
- Anywhere.

09:45.296 --> 09:47.749
The floor, the top of another dirty washing machine.

09:47.882 --> 09:50.652
My Belle and Sebastian t-shirt was in the garbage.

09:51.123 --> 09:54.184
So now, on top of a massive amount of reading and studying,

09:54.322 --> 09:56.955
I get to rewash my formerly perfect clean clothes.

09:57.067 --> 09:59.448
Well, that's just wrong. I think you should quit school in protest.

09:59.545 --> 10:00.744
Okay, if you say so.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.500
Oh, no, wait. That's not ours.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.995
What do you mean it's not ours? Who's it for?

10:04.298 --> 10:06.944
- I've got five minutes. Where's the pizza? 
- There.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.125
- Thanks. Hi, Rory. 
- Hey, Lane.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.920
My mom ordered all the okra in the Western Hemisphere.

10:12.027 --> 10:14.178
- She got a great deal and I'm starving to death. 
- Swallow.

10:15.535 --> 10:18.337
Between Seventh Day Adventist college and my mom's new fascination

10:18.432 --> 10:21.111
with ordering on the internet, my future looks very grim.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.092
- You want a Coke? 
- No, no time for liquids.

10:23.246 --> 10:25.458
I have to be home for dinner in four minutes. Another piece, please?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.610
Great. Okay, this is good. You all look good. Things are good?

10:30.036 --> 10:31.659
- Things are... 
- Okay, gotta go. Thanks for the grub.

10:32.953 --> 10:36.047
- She is so throwing up on the way home. 
- I'm gonna go put this stuff in the washer.

10:36.199 --> 10:38.877
Wait, have some pizza and tell Mama all about your day.

10:39.093 --> 10:44.157
Okay. Oh, yesterday Janet woke up to find that Paris had chaired her in her room.

10:44.371 --> 10:45.350
Oh, nice.

10:45.929 --> 10:48.652
And then, later, when Janet had climbed out the window,

10:48.873 --> 10:52.988
she retaliated by gluing shut the opening of Paris' glue gun.

10:53.118 --> 10:56.154
- Wow, she went for the crafts. 
- This war is getting totally out of hand.

10:56.246 --> 11:00.070
This morning Paris turned off my alarm because Janet woke her up.

11:00.249 --> 11:04.211
I almost missed breakfast. I ran down to the dining hall in my pajamas

11:04.278 --> 11:05.977
and bunny slippers, and of course I ran into Marty.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.886
- Naked guy. 
- It was totally humiliating.

11:09.065 --> 11:10.846
Humiliating 'cause naked guy's hot?

11:10.965 --> 11:14.160
It was humiliating because I had terrycloth rabbits on my feet.

11:14.334 --> 11:15.508
So naked guy's not hot?

11:15.973 --> 11:19.520
Naked guy is Marty, and it's not like that. He's sweet.

11:19.689 --> 11:21.375
Sweet means bad butt.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.929
Sweet does not mean bad butt. Sweet means sweet.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.085
Poor naked guy. He should've left his clothes on.

11:26.222 --> 11:28.937
Okay, you have got to stop talking about naked guy. I just met Marty.

11:29.069 --> 11:31.568
All right. If not him, are there any other guys on the horizon?

11:31.782 --> 11:32.264
Nope.

11:32.948 --> 11:36.304
No? How about a professor - someone older, wiser,

11:36.412 --> 11:39.111
- with brown cords and whiskey breath? 
- Oh, well, yeah. There's one of those.

11:39.413 --> 11:40.175
Come on, Rory.

11:40.385 --> 11:42.939
Well, this guy asked me to go try this restaurant this weekend,

11:43.041 --> 11:45.382
- but it was a totally casual thing. 
- So what'd you tell him?

11:45.669 --> 11:47.275
- That I was busy. 
- You don't like him?

11:47.543 --> 11:50.968
No, I like him fine. I mean, he's smart,

11:51.116 --> 11:54.096
and he takes my side in the debates, and he's decent to look at.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.318
So, why'd you say no? Too many clothes?

11:56.472 --> 12:00.317
I don't know. He... he carries a bottle of water around with him all the time.

12:00.461 --> 12:03.553
- That's just weird. 
- Right. Hydration. Very creepy.

12:03.712 --> 12:05.457
And he's preppy, and I don't really like preppy.

12:05.622 --> 12:07.711
Plus, he's gonna go study in Barcelona next year.

12:08.003 --> 12:10.239
- So? 
- So it's a waste of time. It can't go anywhere.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.324
- It could go to dinner, maybe a movie. 
- Mom...

12:12.509 --> 12:14.787
No, look, Rory, I know you've never really dated.

12:14.945 --> 12:16.871
What are you talking about? I've dated.

12:17.075 --> 12:18.385
- Who did you date? 
- Dean.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.444
You and Dean did not date. You had a relationship.

12:20.562 --> 12:22.809
- Well, Jess. 
- Was relationship number two.

12:22.964 --> 12:25.467
So maybe I've never dated, but you haven't either.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.776
I have dated at least once.

12:27.951 --> 12:31.161
- You had me with dad - relationship. 
- Yes, but...

12:31.268 --> 12:34.505
Max - relationship. Dad again - relationship.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.166
Okay, fine, I may not be the world's best dater,

12:37.264 --> 12:40.227
but I do it and you should give it a shot. I mean, you're in college now.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.159
What else is there to do in college but date?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.125
I'm gonna go wash my clothes now.

12:45.087 --> 12:47.852
Wait. Was that it?

12:48.585 --> 12:49.782
Is this conversation over?

12:50.781 --> 12:51.799
Sorry, did I win?

12:53.966 --> 12:56.613
- Here, I wanted to show you this. 
- Castles of Ireland?

12:57.354 --> 12:59.900
There is a room in here that I've always wanted to do.

13:01.179 --> 13:02.059
Here it is.

13:02.398 --> 13:05.752
Oh, I love that. What is that wall treatment?

13:06.008 --> 13:08.469
- That's anaglypta wallpaper. 
- What are you doing?

13:08.757 --> 13:10.877
I'm looking at anaglypta wallpaper.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.577
And the other three tables are here for support?

13:12.704 --> 13:15.070
Well, we just had a lot of books to go through.

13:15.213 --> 13:19.156
Luke, this is Natalie Zimmerman. Natalie's gonna help us design the Dragonfly.

13:19.273 --> 13:21.321
- Nice to meet you. 
- Did I tell you we're gonna have horses?

13:21.465 --> 13:23.328
The property already has stables, so why not?

13:23.451 --> 13:26.446
I love horses. I've always loved horses ever since I was a little girl,

13:26.594 --> 13:28.813
and now I finally have a grown-up excuse to buy a pony.

13:29.062 --> 13:32.781
Great. Listen, National Velvet, you have to move this stuff out of here.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.094
- Why? 
- Because this is a diner. People wanna sit.

13:35.268 --> 13:38.545
- This is business. 
- No, this is business,

13:38.678 --> 13:42.129
and it's open, and it's decorated, and it wants its seats back.

13:42.430 --> 13:42.989
Fine.

13:44.495 --> 13:48.079
Sorry about that. He's trying to steal the "World's Grumpiest Diner Guy" title from Mel.

13:48.190 --> 13:48.832
No problem.

13:49.425 --> 13:51.453
So you were telling me about anaglypta wallpaper?

13:51.709 --> 13:54.648
Yes, it's a textured paper that we can paint or treat.

13:54.838 --> 13:57.981
We can even distress it if you want to give it a more, you know, vintage-y look.

13:58.232 --> 13:59.055
That sounds interesting.

13:59.322 --> 14:02.645
You know, Emily actually has some in the smaller upstairs guest bath.

14:02.794 --> 14:04.391
You should take a look at it the next time you're there.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.967
- Emily? You mean like my mother, Emily? 
- Yes.

14:07.084 --> 14:09.305
- I didn't know you knew Emily. 
- Oh, yeah.

14:09.475 --> 14:12.952
I did her second-floor remodel about a year ago. I thought that's how you got my name.

14:13.136 --> 14:15.982
Oh, no, I got your name from a magazine.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.677
- So you know Emily? 
- It's a small world, isn't it?

14:18.774 --> 14:20.510
Yes, yes, really small.

14:20.621 --> 14:23.039
About the same square footage as that box they threw McCain in.

14:23.198 --> 14:26.402
So, are you ready to see bedrooms?

14:26.647 --> 14:28.010
Yes, sure. Why not?

14:28.246 --> 14:30.632
Next week we finish up with "Snows of Kilimanjaro",

14:30.740 --> 14:33.391
then it is Hemingway's pal Scott Fitzgerald,

14:33.529 --> 14:35.818
so do yourselves a favor - get a jump on "Tender is the Night."

14:42.063 --> 14:44.486
- Good session today, huh? 
- It was fine.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.619
I can't believe we sit around and talk about books and get graded on it.

14:47.758 --> 14:51.010
I mean, there's almost nothing I like more than talking about a good book

14:51.107 --> 14:53.866
or a bad book or a really thick magazine.

14:56.927 --> 14:57.655
Hey, Trevor.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.153
You know what else I like to do besides talk about a really good book?

15:01.614 --> 15:05.541
Eat. Isn't that weird? And, actually, for me, they're linked.

15:05.950 --> 15:10.142
It's true. When I talk about a book, I get really hungry - starving.

15:10.574 --> 15:12.002
- You ever experience that? 
- Not really.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.193
Oh. Well, it happens to me all the time.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.629
Like right now, for example, starving, really.

15:17.807 --> 15:20.234
And I enjoyed "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" so much

15:20.358 --> 15:23.169
that I will probably be hungry for quite some time.

15:23.999 --> 15:26.420
All weekend, probably. Especially Saturday night.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.303
- Saturday night? 
- Saturday night.

15:28.693 --> 15:30.551
Are you saying you want to go to dinner on Saturday night?

15:30.793 --> 15:33.306
Wow. Okay.

15:33.757 --> 15:35.277
Yeah. Well, I will be hungry.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.116
Well, that fact has been pretty well established.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.141
Okay. Sure. Yeah, let's go to dinner Saturday night.

15:40.383 --> 15:42.154
- So, you're at... 
- Durfee, suite 5.

15:42.369 --> 15:44.110
- I'll pick you up at 7:30. 
- Sounds good.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.032
Okay.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.416
I gotta hand it to you there, Trevor. You sure are persistent.

15:50.305 --> 15:52.348
- Davey? You're naming him Davey? 
- Yes.

15:52.455 --> 15:54.011
- I love Davey. 
- Me, too.

15:54.144 --> 15:56.474
Oh, I can't believe you finally picked a name. It makes it real.

15:56.629 --> 16:00.484
Yes, because the stomach and massive ankles were too ambiguous.

16:00.653 --> 16:01.785
Does Jackson like it?

16:01.891 --> 16:05.276
Well, he's okay with the stomach, but the massive ankles freak him out.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.346
The name Davey.

16:06.618 --> 16:08.789
- It was actually his suggestion. 
- Really?

16:08.972 --> 16:12.644
He wanted Davey if it was a boy and Colgate if it was a girl.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.784
- Colgate? 
- His great-grandmother's name.

16:14.897 --> 16:16.196
Great-grandmother Colgate.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.370
That's horrible.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.296
You know what's worse, she looked like a Colgate.

16:19.428 --> 16:20.702
Well, at least you know it's gonna be a boy.

16:20.826 --> 16:22.582
Yes, but he doesn't know it's going to be a boy.

16:22.698 --> 16:27.358
And I realized he has to know that I thought Colgate was an insane name,

16:27.502 --> 16:31.136
but if I didn't fight him on it, it must be because I knew we weren't gonna have a girl

16:31.275 --> 16:32.826
and then he would know we were gonna have a boy,

16:32.969 --> 16:36.043
and that would spoil everything for him. So I told him,

16:36.196 --> 16:38.515
"We are not naming our daughter after a toothpaste!"

16:38.618 --> 16:40.416
We got in a big fight and we're not talking.

16:40.549 --> 16:42.739
- Cool! 
- Yeah, I know. Everything's perfect.

16:42.991 --> 16:45.826
My baby has a name and my husband's sleeping on the couch.

16:45.919 --> 16:49.381
Oh, and I figured out that I'll go with the Avery stove for the inn.

16:49.503 --> 16:51.888
Is that okay? Because I know it's a little more expensive.

16:51.977 --> 16:52.745
It's your kitchen, Sookie.

16:53.051 --> 16:56.257
Okay, good. I'm gonna call Natalie the minute I get home.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.919
- What's wrong? 
- Nothing.

16:59.666 --> 17:03.480
- It's the Avery. It's too extravagant. 
- No, the Avery's fine. Everything's fine.

17:03.809 --> 17:04.919
- You're sure? 
- I'm sure.

17:05.308 --> 17:09.584
- Just... Natalie knows my mother. 
- Emily? How?

17:09.703 --> 17:12.635
Yes, because she did her second-floor remodel like a year ago.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.443
Oh, so she really knows your mother.

17:14.565 --> 17:15.902
They've been shopping together. It's a bond.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.998
- Sookie, I don't know if I... 
- Lorelai, no.

17:20.141 --> 17:21.576
- She knows my mother. 
- So what?

17:21.928 --> 17:25.368
Sookie, my whole life, my whole existence, my essence,

17:25.462 --> 17:28.856
my being, my ability to be this sparkling creature standing here before you --

17:28.983 --> 17:31.037
all of this depends on the complete and total separation

17:31.144 --> 17:33.475
of my life from my mother's life. That's how it works.

17:33.571 --> 17:35.853
- But we like Natalie. 
- We do like Natalie.

17:36.008 --> 17:38.584
Remember all the other designers we met that we didn't like before Natalie?

17:38.713 --> 17:41.149
Remember the one that wanted to put the tiny mannequin in every room

17:41.276 --> 17:43.401
so that the lonely people would have someone to talk to?

17:43.570 --> 17:46.187
- Yes, I do. 
- Or the purple, purple, purple guy.

17:46.349 --> 17:48.256
- Purple, purple, purple. 
- They were horrible.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.063
And then we met Natalie, and she was perfect.

17:50.471 --> 17:54.578
Look, just try. At least give Natalie a chance, okay? Please?

17:54.768 --> 17:55.997
- I'll try. 
- Good.

17:56.252 --> 17:58.009
I'm gonna go home and get going on the Avery.

17:58.357 --> 18:00.416
All right. I have to stop by Luke's. I'll call you later.

18:00.498 --> 18:03.196
- Okay. It's going to be fine. 
- Yes, it is.

18:05.787 --> 18:07.200
Hey, Luke. What's going on?

18:07.230 --> 18:10.372
Oh, well... Tom called.

18:10.438 --> 18:13.646
The banister on the stairs has to be replaced. It'll be $4,000.

18:13.716 --> 18:16.687
Tamsin Cordally called. He needs a deposit on the quartersawn oak.

18:16.832 --> 18:20.671
It'll be $4,000. Julio the landscaper called. I have no idea what he said,

18:20.800 --> 18:25.295
but it's going to be $4,000. Vicki from Vicki's Horse Supply called.

18:25.383 --> 18:29.012
She thinks Pepper and Gunsmoke would suit your needs, but Gunsmoke snores,

18:29.103 --> 18:31.966
so the stables can't be too close to the guests' bedrooms.

18:32.105 --> 18:34.993
Rory's looking for her black Converse, and, oh, one last thing -

18:35.090 --> 18:37.230
- I'm not taking messages for you anymore! 
- Sorry.

18:37.532 --> 18:40.567
- What did you do, have business cards printed up? 
- People just know I'm here a lot.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.617
I missed a call from my meat guy because I was on the phone

18:42.717 --> 18:44.690
discussing Gunsmoke's deviated septum.

18:44.829 --> 18:47.793
I'm gonna call all these people today and tell them never to call me here again.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.590
- You bet you will. 
- Consider it done.

18:49.814 --> 18:50.312
Good.

18:50.581 --> 18:51.633
- Just... 
- What?

18:51.904 --> 18:55.119
Just one more thing. Did a package arrive for me here today?

18:55.202 --> 18:56.496
- What? 
- I'm sorry. Never mind, never mind.

18:56.642 --> 18:59.180
Luke. Sorry. I'm cutting it kind of close here.

18:59.324 --> 19:02.056
Oh, sorry, Ed. I didn't realize you were cutting it kind of close.

19:02.133 --> 19:05.109
Everybody, drop everything. Ed's cutting it kind of close.

19:05.314 --> 19:07.424
- Here's your tickets. 
- You seem mad.

19:07.695 --> 19:10.813
Look, Ed, just go to the game and enjoy it, okay?

19:10.965 --> 19:13.356
- Choke on a hot dog while you're at it. 
- I have to tell you, Luke,

19:13.423 --> 19:15.717
I am never accepting anything free from you again.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.864
What a threat! Boy, you're a real master of fear, there, Ed.

19:21.190 --> 19:22.558
Look out, Jason and Freddy.

19:22.798 --> 19:25.793
Ed may never mooch off of either one of you ever again!

19:28.931 --> 19:30.520
- What is wrong with you? 
- Nothing.

19:30.719 --> 19:32.481
- You're yelling at Ed. 
- Ah, Ed bugs me.

19:32.608 --> 19:34.763
- Ed cries. 
- I'm just having a bad day.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.249
Excuse me?

19:36.412 --> 19:39.900
Days. You've been stomping around, barking at people for days.

19:40.192 --> 19:42.382
- I have not. 
- Yes, Cujo, you have.

19:42.624 --> 19:45.561
- I always talk to people like that. 
- No, Benji, you don't.

19:45.798 --> 19:48.300
- I'll be fine tomorrow. 
- Really, Lassie? Why is that?

19:49.057 --> 19:51.966
Look, I bought these tickets for Nicole 'cause she's a Yankees fan.

19:52.085 --> 19:53.944
I thought it'd be nice if we went to a game together.

19:54.097 --> 19:56.647
- Oh, man. 
- And it's no big deal.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.915
I mean, the closer it got to the game, the more I felt like a loser.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.427
I mean, I'm sitting on these tickets, which means I thought I'd still be in a relationship.

20:02.699 --> 20:06.406
I don't know. Stupid. I broke my own rule. I asked for it.

20:08.132 --> 20:08.924
What are you talking about?

20:10.860 --> 20:13.758
Never plan for anything more than two days in advance.

20:14.076 --> 20:15.099
That's your rule?

20:15.259 --> 20:17.731
Yes, 'cause when you make plans, then you have expectations,

20:17.848 --> 20:20.861
and when you have expectations, then you will get disappointed.

20:21.008 --> 20:23.200
Having expectations also gives you something to look forward to.

20:23.328 --> 20:25.749
Yes, then you're looking forward to being constantly disappointed.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.700
- You're not that cynical. 
- I am today.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.109
Hey, I have an idea.

20:29.959 --> 20:32.697
- Tomorrow night is usually movie night. 
- What?

20:32.816 --> 20:35.937
Rory and I would always rent a bunch of movies, order food -- it was our thing.

20:36.457 --> 20:41.231
Now she's at school and busy, so why don't you come over? It might be fun.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.879
- Okay. 
- Yeah?

20:44.034 --> 20:47.355
- Sure, what else have I got to do? 
- Ah, I love when men say that to me.

20:47.554 --> 20:48.160
What time?

20:48.436 --> 20:49.460
- Eight. 
- Eight it is.

20:49.598 --> 20:52.030
I'll stop by the video store and pick us up a couple movies. What do you want to see?

20:52.451 --> 20:53.326
I don't know.

20:54.130 --> 20:56.556
Come on, tell me. I don't want to get something you've seen.

20:56.869 --> 20:58.516
Don't worry about it. I haven't seen anything.

20:58.922 --> 21:01.119
- People always say that. 
- Well, with me, it's true.

21:01.666 --> 21:02.982
- "Casablanca"? 
- Nope.

21:03.115 --> 21:05.532
You have never seen "Casablanca"? Are you kidding?

21:05.741 --> 21:07.145
Just get anything, please.

21:07.273 --> 21:08.549
- "Chinatown"? 
- Anything at all.

21:08.808 --> 21:10.882
- "Bonnie and Clyde"? 
- A video game would be nice also.

21:10.985 --> 21:12.863
"It Happened One Night"? "His Girl Friday"?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.633
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre"? "Diner"?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.300
I saw "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."

21:19.450 --> 21:22.863
Oh. My house, eight o'clock. We have such work to do.

21:23.119 --> 21:23.826
I'll see you there.

21:24.103 --> 21:28.327
Oh, by the way, if my package arrives today, bring it with you, okay? Thanks.

21:35.132 --> 21:36.979
Hold on, whoa.

21:37.691 --> 21:39.155
Wow, that could have been very ugly, huh?

21:39.626 --> 21:42.694
The great cappuccino disaster of 2003. Very sad -- Shelley Winters drowns.

21:43.435 --> 21:44.573
Think the coffee was stronger than I thought.

21:44.715 --> 21:45.852
- Can I take your coat? 
- Thank you.

21:46.262 --> 21:48.530
Your daughter called and said she was gonna be late. Her class ran long.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.525
- Oh, so Rory's not here yet? 
- No, it's just you and your mother.

21:53.873 --> 21:57.500
Gosh. You know what? I just remembered I left something in the car,

21:57.732 --> 22:00.414
so I'll be right back. Could I - just - it's new.

22:00.603 --> 22:03.348
I can't be away from it just yet. Oh, thanks.

22:03.885 --> 22:04.719
Okay. Back in a flash.

22:40.699 --> 22:41.302
What are you doing?

22:43.044 --> 22:44.267
I was looking for my lip gloss.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.858
You need the radio on to look for your lip gloss?

22:47.084 --> 22:49.910
Well, I came out here and I couldn't find it

22:50.032 --> 22:53.074
and so I thought maybe if I tried to retrace my steps, it would turn up.

22:53.227 --> 22:55.019
- Very clever idea. 
- Yeah, I thought so.

22:55.105 --> 22:57.984
So I put my purse on the seat and I put the keys in the car,

22:58.077 --> 23:00.559
and naturally the radio came on 'cause that's what it does, and,

23:00.744 --> 23:03.968
"Shadow Dancing" was playing, which was one of my all time favorite songs in junior high.

23:04.353 --> 23:06.682
- And you forgot to look for your lip gloss. 
- Just for a second.

23:06.995 --> 23:09.750
Which makes sense since it's in the ashtray right next to you.

23:09.950 --> 23:12.488
Oh, hey. It is. Look at that.

23:12.612 --> 23:14.465
Yes, it's a miracle. Come inside, Lorelai.

23:14.843 --> 23:17.097
Well, can't I just wait 'til the song... I'm coming.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.302
You can't sit here for three seconds without Rory.

23:20.434 --> 23:21.310
Not true.

23:21.725 --> 23:24.090
Oh, stop it and sit down. I want to talk to you about something.

23:27.107 --> 23:29.149
I just found out that Sookie is pregnant.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.470
Don't look at me, I had nothing to do with it.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.510
- May I ask why you didn't bother to tell me? 
- Well...

23:37.715 --> 23:40.128
Lorelai, your not telling me about Sookie is unforgivable.

23:40.214 --> 23:42.860
- Why, it's not like you're such good friends. 
- I went to her wedding.

23:43.168 --> 23:44.110
So did Kirk.

23:44.295 --> 23:46.818
I haven't sent her a gift, Lorelai. How does that make me look?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.886
Like you hate her and all childbearing women.

23:48.963 --> 23:50.842
You are so intent on keeping me out of your life.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.634
It's not even my life. It's Sookie's life.

23:52.784 --> 23:55.241
A simple phone call to tell me that Sookie is pregnant.

23:55.435 --> 23:56.988
How did you find out about it, anyway?

23:57.202 --> 23:59.854
Why, are you going to track down the informant and have him shot?

24:00.141 --> 24:00.704
Maybe.

24:00.878 --> 24:03.970
It doesn't matter how I found out. I found out, no thanks to you.

24:04.165 --> 24:05.721
Mom, please, just tell me how you found out.

24:06.116 --> 24:08.036
Why? Does it bother you not knowing?

24:08.282 --> 24:09.551
- Yes. 
- Me, too.

24:09.756 --> 24:12.573
- Rory, you're here. 
- I'm so sorry I'm late, Grandma.

24:12.737 --> 24:13.740
- Hi, Mom. 
- You'll pay.

24:13.959 --> 24:15.818
So come on, sit down and tell me all about Yale.

24:16.089 --> 24:17.217
If you don't, she'll find out anyway.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.094
Yale's interesting. It's a lot more free-form than I thought.

24:20.262 --> 24:22.888
Well, you're an adult now. They treat you like an adult in college.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.733
In college, yes. In the Gilmore house...

24:24.876 --> 24:26.806
We've switched subjects, in case you were wondering.

24:26.991 --> 24:30.200
So tell me, what are your plans for the weekend? Any parties going on?

24:30.457 --> 24:33.318
Yeah, there are always parties going on, but I'm not going to a party this weekend.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.617
- I'm actually going on a date. 
- You are?

24:36.038 --> 24:38.419
- Well, your first college date. 
- Who's the lucky guy?

24:38.691 --> 24:40.470
- Just a guy from my English class. 
- No.

24:40.656 --> 24:42.745
- Your English class. 
- What happened?

24:42.846 --> 24:44.515
- I thought you turned him down. 
- You turned him down?

24:44.639 --> 24:47.092
I know, but I thought about it and I reconsidered.

24:47.225 --> 24:48.209
What did you do? Did you ask him out?

24:48.310 --> 24:50.261
You asked him out? Oh, Rory, tell me you didn't ask a boy out.

24:50.429 --> 24:53.169
I didn't ask him out. I just made sure he knew I was available.

24:53.363 --> 24:55.251
- Better, Mom? 
- No, that's not better.

24:55.426 --> 24:59.851
Rory, you're in Yale, not Amsterdam. How you conduct yourself socially

24:59.953 --> 25:02.499
is as important as how you conduct yourself academically.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.171
I promise, it was very proper.

25:04.428 --> 25:07.141
Yes, Mom, she had a nice Tiffany lampshade over her red light.

25:07.259 --> 25:09.641
What do you know about this boy? Do you know where he's from, who his parents are?

25:09.814 --> 25:11.770
No, I plan to find that out on the date.

25:12.031 --> 25:13.543
- What are you gonna wear? 
- I don't know.

25:13.721 --> 25:14.672
Do you want to borrow something of mine?

25:14.841 --> 25:16.562
- No, she does not. 
- What does that mean?

25:16.707 --> 25:19.998
It's bad enough that you haven't taught your daughter how to interact with the opposite sex.

25:20.142 --> 25:23.142
You will not dress her up in one of your "Sex and the City" ensembles

25:23.259 --> 25:26.573
and send her out to tell the entire campus, "Don't worry. I'll ask you."

25:26.706 --> 25:28.354
How do you know about "Sex and the City"?

25:30.274 --> 25:32.748
Okay, see, something like this outside against a wall -

25:32.838 --> 25:34.320
very "Little House on the Prairie" with a twist.

25:34.570 --> 25:36.705
I love "Little House on the Prairie." Jack the dog.

25:36.858 --> 25:38.871
Where is Lindsay Sidney Greenbush?

25:39.070 --> 25:41.662
When she came tumbling down the hill, I would just laugh.

25:42.578 --> 25:44.129
- Lorelai? 
- Yeah?

25:44.405 --> 25:46.895
- What do you think? 
- I don't know. I'm not really sure.

25:47.047 --> 25:50.586
Okay. Well, just keep in mind that anything you see here I can have duplicated.

25:50.771 --> 25:54.046
I've got this guy in Delaware that can knock off anything for about half the price.

25:54.191 --> 25:55.045
Maybe we should go.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.073
What? We just got started.

25:57.283 --> 25:59.474
Well, maybe we should think a little more before we shop.

25:59.736 --> 26:01.615
What are you talking about? We've been thinking for months.

26:01.722 --> 26:06.074
Let's start buying! Holy mother of God, this bench is $15,000.

26:06.335 --> 26:07.463
We can find something else.

26:07.677 --> 26:10.134
- Oh, no, we don't have to find something else. 
- What are you talking about?

26:10.298 --> 26:12.516
We have absolutely no problem paying full price for that bench.

26:12.693 --> 26:13.605
- What? 
- Yeah.

26:13.846 --> 26:15.945
No money problems or problems of any kind.

26:16.431 --> 26:19.089
Our entire lives are perfect. We have no complaints and plenty of money.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.949
- What are you talking about? 
- You know what,

26:21.087 --> 26:24.042
I see a lawn jockey out there that looks very interesting. I'll be back.

26:26.765 --> 26:30.599
- We cannot afford that bench. 
- Oh, I know that. I don't want her to know that.

26:30.865 --> 26:32.304
- Her - Natalie, her? 
- Yes.

26:32.422 --> 26:34.480
- Why? 
- Because it could get back to my mother.

26:34.629 --> 26:37.204
- What could get back to your mother? 
- That we have money problems.

26:37.439 --> 26:38.525
We do have money problems.

26:38.755 --> 26:41.315
I know, but I don't want my mother knowing that we have money problems.

26:41.453 --> 26:44.363
I don't want any personal information leaked out because in Emily's hands,

26:44.409 --> 26:46.620
- that could be a weapon. 
- Well, Natalie's not gonna say anything.

26:46.850 --> 26:49.051
How do you know? How do you know she's not filling my mother in

26:49.144 --> 26:51.862
- on our every move on a daily basis? 
- You're being paranoid.

26:51.975 --> 26:54.524
Oh, yeah? My mother found out about you being pregnant.

26:55.005 --> 26:56.814
- Not from Natalie. 
- How do you know?

26:56.917 --> 26:59.855
Because Natalie herself didn't know until about a half an hour ago.

26:59.982 --> 27:00.725
That's her story.

27:01.565 --> 27:03.674
Okay. This is getting crazy now.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.799
You have got to go out there and talk to her about this.

27:06.142 --> 27:09.608
- I don't know. 
- It's the only fair thing. Come on. Go.

27:16.566 --> 27:20.939
Hey, look, Natalie, I have to say something to you.

27:21.027 --> 27:23.596
I feel a tad silly even mentioning it, but I think I have to.

27:23.961 --> 27:26.111
- Did I do something that... 
- No, you did nothing.

27:26.254 --> 27:29.080
You've been great, really. Great ideas, great attitude.

27:29.423 --> 27:31.593
- It's just that... you know my mother. 
- Yes?

27:32.018 --> 27:34.134
That's it. You know my mother.

27:34.415 --> 27:39.187
And my mother and I don't exactly have the smoothest of relationships.

27:40.554 --> 27:44.497
Right. I mean, we're not warring or anything, but it's just that we're very different,

27:44.711 --> 27:48.424
and I feel kind of weird sharing things with her.

27:48.737 --> 27:51.552
Look, I promise you, I haven't been in contact with your mother for a long time.

27:52.058 --> 27:54.674
Maybe twice she called to get a couple of names, but that was it.

27:54.901 --> 27:56.262
I hadn't even met you yet.

27:56.646 --> 27:59.805
So trust me -- she knows nothing that you haven't told her yourself.

27:59.964 --> 28:02.832
Oh. Okay. I feel really stupid right now.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.028
No, don't. I enjoyed working with your mother,

28:05.223 --> 28:08.064
but this inn is the kid of thing that I love to do.

28:08.591 --> 28:11.034
And the place has incredible potential and somebody's gonna get a chance

28:11.176 --> 28:15.964
to make it a wonderful inn. I would be heartsick if I lost this opportunity.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.072
Look, I haven't spoken to Emily in months.

28:19.303 --> 28:21.130
I doubt I'll be speaking to her in the future. I promise.

28:22.169 --> 28:23.562
- Okay. 
- Really?

28:23.674 --> 28:25.461
- Absolutely. 
- I'm so glad.

28:25.589 --> 28:26.399
So am I.

28:26.673 --> 28:28.550
So now that I talked myself back into a job,

28:28.657 --> 28:31.437
what do you think the outlook for this lawn jockey is?

28:31.570 --> 28:32.045
Not good.

28:33.147 --> 28:35.021
- Emily would hate it. 
- Wrap it up.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.432
Okay, so this is option number four.

28:40.018 --> 28:40.479
Tanna?

28:41.376 --> 28:41.763
Tanna?

28:42.640 --> 28:47.421
- We're doing the whole bonding thing now. 
- Okay. Sorry. Start again.

28:47.939 --> 28:48.610
What do you think?

28:49.014 --> 28:51.333
Men respond subconsciously to a woman's pheromones.

28:51.553 --> 28:54.595
You should run in place 'til he gets here. It'll give you a nice musk.

28:54.978 --> 28:55.757
Go back to your leg.

28:57.012 --> 28:58.328
Roommates meeting starts in two minutes.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.624
Hey, I told you to stop with the math and the Sharpies on my good sheets.

29:01.866 --> 29:02.731
Okay. Sorry.

29:03.752 --> 29:06.217
- How come the puppy doesn't pee on your bed? 
- I'll be right out, Paris.

29:06.336 --> 29:06.843
Hurry up.

29:07.677 --> 29:09.070
All right, everyone, take a seat, please.

29:10.298 --> 29:12.752
Rory, one last curtsy, and let's move.

29:13.617 --> 29:15.561
My date will be here in ten minutes, so talk fast.

29:16.474 --> 29:17.282
Thank you all for coming.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.938
Now, I'd like to start this meeting by saying that no one here is on trial.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.467
This meeting is about healing, it is about redemption,

29:23.591 --> 29:26.289
it is about accepting responsibility and making amends.

29:26.422 --> 29:27.210
I don't believe this.

29:27.416 --> 29:30.640
This is a forum for all of us to air our grievances so we can resolve them

29:30.741 --> 29:31.865
and go on with our lives.

29:32.211 --> 29:34.306
Hey, since I'm already standing, why don't I start?

29:34.655 --> 29:35.627
This is thrilling.

29:36.447 --> 29:39.093
Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here

29:39.202 --> 29:42.406
shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour

29:42.489 --> 29:44.029
like a greyhound is selfish.

29:44.203 --> 29:46.488
I have a partial athletic scholarship, Paris.

29:46.686 --> 29:49.494
The grunting and the sweating, and there are plastic balls everywhere.

29:49.559 --> 29:51.044
- One balance ball. 
- No one can sleep.

29:51.176 --> 29:53.804
No one can breathe. Rory missed breakfast the other day.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.913
You've seen Rory eat. She cannot miss breakfast.

29:56.010 --> 29:57.008
Paris has a point there.

29:57.173 --> 29:58.816
Excuse me, but if I remember correctly,

29:58.985 --> 30:01.326
Rory missed breakfast because you turned her alarm off.

30:01.438 --> 30:03.050
Janet does have a point there.

30:03.163 --> 30:05.887
And while we're airing grievances, what about your stupid craft area?

30:06.077 --> 30:09.251
Everywhere you turn, there's glitter or seashells or macaroni.

30:09.396 --> 30:12.795
- And the smell of the glue. 
- Hey, I make things we can all enjoy.

30:12.949 --> 30:15.898
I am contributing. The coasters I make are for everyone.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.637
Those push-ups are for you and you alone.

30:17.756 --> 30:20.264
- I vote we get rid of craft corner. 
- No, that's my emotional homework!

30:20.372 --> 30:22.629
Okay, let's just all calm down for a sec.

30:22.769 --> 30:24.949
No. I cannot calm down. I have tried to be reasonable.

30:25.056 --> 30:27.500
I have told myself over and over, "God, look at her.

30:27.648 --> 30:29.737
Imagine what she's been through to make her turn out like that."

30:29.884 --> 30:31.375
- A lot! 
- But you're impossible!

30:31.575 --> 30:33.863
And frankly, I'm just sick of your constant negativity!

30:34.052 --> 30:36.823
You're on steroids, aren't you? That's what's behind this obsessive behavior.

30:36.955 --> 30:38.087
You're calling me obsessive?

30:41.174 --> 30:44.128
- I am not intimidated or afraid of you. 
- Hi. You ready to go?

30:44.365 --> 30:46.300
Just one sec. We're finishing up a roommates meeting.

30:46.694 --> 30:47.963
- I'll race you. 
- What?

30:48.107 --> 30:50.622
To Hewitt Quad and back. I win, no alarm before seven a.m.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.842
You win, I move my crafts area into Rory's and my room.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.069
- Forget it. I am not gonna race...
- On your mark, get set, go.

30:58.543 --> 31:00.741
Now they're gonna have a nice musk.

31:01.645 --> 31:02.915
- Shall we? 
- After you.

31:07.553 --> 31:09.915
Ah, man bearing bags of food. Come in.

31:10.088 --> 31:12.105
- I went a little overboard here. 
- No such thing.

31:12.232 --> 31:15.131
I got tons of fries, half a pumpkin pie. You got whipped cream here?

31:15.280 --> 31:15.877
Always.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.557
And, I wasn't sure what to do with the burgers

31:17.675 --> 31:19.898
because sometimes you order with double cheese, sometimes you don't,

31:19.990 --> 31:22.212
so I brought one with normal cheese and one with...

31:23.660 --> 31:25.068
- What did you do? 
- I ordered food.

31:26.068 --> 31:27.189
I said I'd bring food.

31:27.454 --> 31:29.160
So I can't contribute, like I'm a piker?

31:29.584 --> 31:31.464
No. Just that I didn't need to bring food.

31:32.166 --> 31:35.499
I'm leftover girl. I'll have the burgers tonight and the Chinese food during the week.

31:36.226 --> 31:38.842
Then you just should have ordered the Chinese fresh tomorrow instead of tonight.

31:39.078 --> 31:42.088
I don't like fresh Chinese food. I like stale Chinese food.

31:42.220 --> 31:42.810
I give up.

31:43.301 --> 31:44.720
- I got you a nice, cold beer. 
- Appreciate it.

31:49.329 --> 31:52.584
You are one click away from "Casablanca."

31:52.865 --> 31:53.685
Start it up.

31:54.170 --> 31:57.181
No, whoa. We need to get situated. Are you all situated?

31:57.279 --> 31:59.030
- I'm situated. 
- You need to, like, squish around a little.

31:59.188 --> 32:00.581
- I don't need to. 
- Come on, squish around a little bit.

32:00.673 --> 32:01.758
I'm fine how I am.

32:02.470 --> 32:04.949
Okay, but, you can't squish during the movie

32:05.016 --> 32:07.063
because it's distracting. That's rule number one.

32:07.488 --> 32:08.231
There's rules?

32:08.563 --> 32:11.480
Oh, yeah, especially for a true classic like "Casablanca."

32:11.815 --> 32:13.755
It's not like we're watching a there's-nothing-else-on movie

32:13.889 --> 32:16.541
or a guilty pleasure like "Hardbodies." Oh, my God. Have you seen "Hardbodies"?

32:16.740 --> 32:17.356
I don't think so.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.119
Three middle-aged guys rent a beach house and they hire this young local stud

32:21.195 --> 32:23.893
to introduce them to cute girls, a.k.a. "Hardbodies."

32:24.267 --> 32:26.822
- Let's see that. 
- No, Luke, we're seeing "Casablanca."

32:27.523 --> 32:29.054
- Then let's see that. 
- Okay, the rest of the rules -

32:29.177 --> 32:31.552
no talking during the movie. No exceptions during a true classic.

32:31.791 --> 32:35.249
And minimize distraction. You know, no shifting around a lot,

32:35.352 --> 32:37.635
no phone calls, nothing. No going to the bathroom.

32:37.758 --> 32:40.308
If you go, you miss the movie 'cause we're not pausing the movie.

32:40.431 --> 32:42.162
That's the only way to get the flow of the thing, okay?

32:42.730 --> 32:43.712
- Fair enough. 
- Okay.

32:45.890 --> 32:46.652
Here we go.

32:50.005 --> 32:50.711
What's that?

32:50.922 --> 32:54.199
Okay... A, no talking during the movie,

32:54.793 --> 32:58.606
and B, don't tell me you've never seen the FBI warning before.

32:58.740 --> 32:59.482
It's new to me.

33:00.056 --> 33:02.535
Oh, my God. You're beyond monk. You're uber-monk.

33:02.663 --> 33:04.285
Just start it up. I won't talk again.

33:04.382 --> 33:05.842
Okay, just one more warning -

33:06.031 --> 33:09.339
when they showed the first motion picture over a hundred years ago,

33:09.548 --> 33:12.775
it featured a train rushing toward the camera,

33:12.989 --> 33:17.177
and people were so sure the train was going to burst off the screen

33:17.501 --> 33:20.459
and crush them that they ran away in terror.

33:21.309 --> 33:25.426
Now, Luke, the train is not going to leave the screen.

33:25.590 --> 33:26.527
- Hit the button. 
- Okay.

33:37.904 --> 33:39.936
Hang onto this. We'll page you when the table's ready.

33:40.044 --> 33:40.561
Thank you.

33:41.263 --> 33:44.928
A riot of color. Geeky but cool. Ever been to Italy?

33:45.206 --> 33:49.951
No. Yes. What am I saying? Yes. I was just there. Duh.

33:50.094 --> 33:50.862
Hard thing to forget.

33:51.102 --> 33:55.512
Yeah. I'm just so used to not having been anywhere, but yeah, I have.

33:55.772 --> 33:56.444
And what's it like?

33:57.544 --> 33:58.055
Terrific.

34:03.064 --> 34:04.506
Boy, they have these places all over.

34:05.383 --> 34:08.327
Two in Miami, Detroit. Hey, two in my hometown.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.313
- Now, that's a great town. 
- Definitely.

34:10.621 --> 34:11.578
So you've been there?

34:12.505 --> 34:13.831
- Where? 
- Chicago.

34:14.077 --> 34:16.723
- Is that were you're from? 
- Oh, I thought you saw where I was pointing.

34:17.011 --> 34:17.953
Oh, no.

34:20.822 --> 34:23.472
You know, I miss things about home that I didn't think I'd miss.

34:23.953 --> 34:26.339
Like my little brother Brian. He drove me crazy my whole life,

34:26.473 --> 34:29.277
and now I can't wait for his e-mails. You have any siblings?

34:29.585 --> 34:30.844
No.

34:36.630 --> 34:40.121
You know, I read this article once about restaurants like this

34:40.255 --> 34:43.036
where they have an open bowl of mints that you grab on your way out.

34:43.221 --> 34:46.150
And when people come out of the bathroom, a lot of them don't wash their hands.

34:46.282 --> 34:49.927
They'll grab a mint and walk out, and people have studied the mints

34:50.065 --> 34:52.793
and they found traces of urine in them, so they're urine mints.

34:57.335 --> 34:59.594
- Hey, we're being paged. 
- Good.

35:00.547 --> 35:01.526
Right this way.

35:15.415 --> 35:16.762
- Thank you. 
- Enjoy.

35:21.405 --> 35:23.510
- Stop doing that. 
- Shh, no talking.

35:23.684 --> 35:25.168
- Then stop doing that. 
- Doing what?

35:25.301 --> 35:26.055
Looking at me.

35:27.939 --> 35:29.694
Vain party, table for one.

35:29.930 --> 35:32.541
You know what I mean. You're watching me watch the movie. It's creepy.

35:33.513 --> 35:36.145
I enjoy watching people watch certain parts of certain movies.

35:36.304 --> 35:38.035
But you look over just before something big happens,

35:38.143 --> 35:39.341
so I always know something's coming.

35:39.536 --> 35:40.125
Oh, I do?

35:40.355 --> 35:42.772
You did it just before Humphrey Bogart saw Ingrid Bergman for the first time.

35:43.037 --> 35:45.295
Well, she's the costar. You knew something was coming.

35:46.305 --> 35:49.484
- There goes our flow. 
- Well, we missed stuff while we were talking.

35:50.058 --> 35:52.000
- Hi, it's Lorelai. Leave me a message. 
- You're back too far, we've seen this.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.620
- I didn't. I was looking at you. 
- We'll never get through this.

35:54.697 --> 35:55.550
Mom, are you there?

35:56.226 --> 35:58.342
- Oh, wait, wait. 
- Come on.

35:59.290 --> 36:00.749
Mom, if you're there, pick up.

36:02.975 --> 36:04.987
- Honey, are you okay? 
- There goes the phone rule.

36:05.142 --> 36:07.860
- No, this whole night is sucking. 
- What? How?

36:08.064 --> 36:10.680
You're right - I've never dated before, and I know that now

36:10.804 --> 36:13.517
because of this feeling I have. I've never had this feeling before.

36:13.763 --> 36:15.437
Sort of frozen, sort of unsure,

36:15.822 --> 36:18.069
sort of wishing you'd read a lot of dating articles in preparation?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.993
I have no idea what I'm doing here, and everyone is staring at me

36:21.095 --> 36:24.055
- because they know we're on a bad first date. 
- Oh, so the guy's a dud?

36:24.199 --> 36:25.493
Trevor's fine. I'm moronic.

36:25.636 --> 36:28.663
I bring the conversation to a crashing halt every time I speak.

36:28.904 --> 36:29.856
Well, where is he now?

36:30.055 --> 36:33.004
In the bathroom, probably pondering my brilliant anecdote about urine mints.

36:33.178 --> 36:34.218
About what?

36:34.505 --> 36:36.364
You know, when people go to the bathroom and they don't wash their hands

36:36.497 --> 36:37.812
and they come out and they take a mint.

36:38.339 --> 36:40.999
Oh, my God. I've been eating those mints for years.

36:41.202 --> 36:43.245
- Hey, did you know about urine mints? 
- What?

36:43.382 --> 36:45.298
And I've already forgotten everything that he said to me -

36:45.395 --> 36:47.397
the name of his brother and sister and best friend.

36:47.525 --> 36:49.814
And we're sitting on the same side of the table.

36:49.931 --> 36:53.756
We keep bumping menus, and my neck already hurts from trying to turn

36:53.889 --> 36:56.618
and look at him when he talks. Can I tell him to sit on the other side?

36:56.854 --> 36:59.500
Honey, you just...you have to relax, 'cause it's just a date,

36:59.649 --> 37:00.878
and sometimes dates don't go well.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.480
I mean, I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but if he comes back

37:03.571 --> 37:05.168
and you're on the phone, it might make things more awkward.

37:05.337 --> 37:07.708
- Bite the bullet, huh? 
- Yeah. Sorry, but yeah.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.754
- Okay. I'll talk to you later. 
- Bye.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.603
- Oh, poor thing. 
- Dating's the worst.

37:15.808 --> 37:17.978
Yeah, but they're sitting on the same side of the table

37:18.200 --> 37:22.332
and that's awkward, and she can't think of what to say next,

37:22.469 --> 37:25.854
and you know, she's just gotta go through it and figure it out on her own.

37:26.017 --> 37:29.029
You just have to throw them out there and let them learn what those wings are for.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.759
She could say there's a draft.

37:32.367 --> 37:33.391
- What? 
- Where she's sitting.

37:33.528 --> 37:36.012
She could say the air conditioning is hitting her, switch to the other side,

37:36.150 --> 37:38.586
- and just blame it on that. 
- That's perfect.

37:41.874 --> 37:43.913
- Mom? 
- Hey. Is he back yet?

37:44.060 --> 37:47.471
Say there's a draft and move to the other side of the table.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.301
It's very ladylike to feel drafts. He'll totally understand.

37:50.574 --> 37:51.444
Okay, good.

37:51.571 --> 37:53.851
And then ask what his brother and sister's names are.

37:53.932 --> 37:56.221
- He'll like that you cared enough to confirm. 
- Yeah, that seems right.

37:56.441 --> 38:00.101
Don't worry about the conversation. Just talk, and if the talk doesn't flow, it doesn't.

38:00.270 --> 38:02.928
And stay away from urine-related topics, and you're good to go.

38:03.144 --> 38:05.455
- Thanks, Mom. 
- Oh, the draft thing was Luke's.

38:05.622 --> 38:07.501
- Well, thank him for me, too. I'd better go. 
- Go, go.

38:08.175 --> 38:10.568
Oh, good. I feel so much better. She says thanks.

38:10.787 --> 38:12.666
I wouldn't trade places with her for the world.

38:12.928 --> 38:15.258
Really? You wouldn't want to go out with a boy named Trevor?

38:15.523 --> 38:18.320
- You might want to wait and see his picture. 
- I mean dating. It's a horror.

38:18.473 --> 38:21.867
It's the only cure for the singleness thing, barring ordering a spouse off the internet.

38:22.196 --> 38:24.821
- I missed nothing by not dating. 
- Not true.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.938
If I had dated a lot, I'd still be single.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.511
I'd just have spent a lot of bad nights at Tony Roma's.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.614
Yeah, but dating is how you get to know your potential partner. It's the only way.

38:32.885 --> 38:37.581
There's the gut. I can tell if I'm comfortable with someone within seconds of meeting them.

38:37.985 --> 38:40.632
I feel it here. I felt it with Rachel. I felt it with Nicole.

38:40.853 --> 38:43.750
- I was immediately relaxed. 
- You've got the gut thing.

38:43.873 --> 38:46.414
Well, it's just knowing that someone will let you be.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.383
- That's a gut thing. 
- Aah! You're fast-forwarding.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.773
We'll not gonna get through this thing. I just wanna get to the good parts.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.530
There are no bad parts of "Casablanca."

38:53.729 --> 38:55.414
Just go back. Back.

38:55.715 --> 38:57.143
I'm gonna go grab dessert.

39:00.456 --> 39:01.184
Hey, phone again.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.193
- Hello? 
- Who is this?

39:08.429 --> 39:10.460
- Who's this? 
- This is Emily Gilmore.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.310
- Who's this? 
- Luke Danes, Mrs. Gilmore.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.483
Your daughter's friend from the diner.

39:15.090 --> 39:17.891
I'm not really supposed to be talking to you here. Hang on.

39:17.978 --> 39:20.911
- Why did you answer the phone? 
- You answered it before.

39:21.035 --> 39:23.243
Yeah, but that was Rory. You should have told her I'm not here.

39:23.349 --> 39:25.264
- Then what would I be doing here? 
- Light maintenance.

39:25.366 --> 39:26.979
- Come on, take it. 
- You broke a rule.

39:27.097 --> 39:28.101
You've broken every rule.

39:28.222 --> 39:30.641
Yeah, but dodging my mother's phone calls is not a movie-night rule.

39:30.718 --> 39:31.551
It's an always rule.

39:34.859 --> 39:36.283
Hi, Mom. What's up?

39:36.405 --> 39:38.212
So now you're telling people they can't speak to me?

39:38.331 --> 39:40.972
No, Mom. It's just a little movie-night rule.

39:41.490 --> 39:43.425
If you and Luke wanna talk, you guys can talk.

39:43.579 --> 39:46.251
- I'm talking about Natalie Zimmerman. 
- Natalie?

39:46.476 --> 39:49.880
I called her today about sprucing up a room she did for me a year ago,

39:50.030 --> 39:52.631
and, as you would say, she blew me off.

39:52.861 --> 39:53.890
Well, what did she say?

39:54.074 --> 39:56.394
She said she couldn't help me out, but she wouldn't say why,

39:56.569 --> 40:00.495
so I leaned on her a bit. She cracked and said she'd made you certain promises.

40:00.654 --> 40:02.922
Mom, I never told her she couldn't work for you.

40:03.163 --> 40:04.012
She said you did.

40:04.274 --> 40:07.407
- Well, no. Our agreement was... 
- So there was an agreement.

40:07.597 --> 40:09.096
- Yes, but... 
- To exclude me?

40:09.372 --> 40:11.115
No. Well, not exactly.

40:11.205 --> 40:13.766
You know, Lorelai, perhaps it would be easier if you just gave me

40:13.842 --> 40:16.172
a list of the people I'm not allowed to have contact with.

40:16.357 --> 40:20.442
So far I know there's Natalie and Sookie and Luke on movie night.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.084
What about Richard? Am I still allowed to talk to my husband?

40:23.239 --> 40:26.521
Mom, this is just a big misunderstanding. Go ahead and hire Natalie.

40:26.638 --> 40:28.542
But you'll still have a problem with both of us using her.

40:28.651 --> 40:31.747
I will cease working with her. She's all yours. I'll tell her tomorrow.

40:31.892 --> 40:35.402
Oh, wonderful. So it'll be my fault she loses the job.

40:35.619 --> 40:40.595
No, Lorelai, you keep her, and I promise I'll never speak to her - ever.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.996
If she's bleeding on the side of the road, I'll drive by and pretend I didn't see.

40:44.302 --> 40:45.481
- Mom... 
- I have to go.

40:45.706 --> 40:46.786
I'm firing Natalie.

40:47.087 --> 40:48.797
- That's up to you. 
- Consider it done.

40:48.956 --> 40:50.594
- I'll see you Friday. 
- Yup.

40:59.841 --> 41:01.510
I know just how you feel, Rick.

41:07.870 --> 41:08.394
Mom?

41:11.950 --> 41:14.060
Tell me he didn't fall asleep during "Casablanca."

41:14.311 --> 41:17.301
No, we made it through "Casablanca." He fell asleep during "Hardbodies."

41:17.777 --> 41:19.933
How do you fall asleep during a classic like "Hardbodies"?

41:20.407 --> 41:22.083
There's no accounting for taste.

41:23.757 --> 41:25.074
He looks comfy there, doesn't he?

41:25.724 --> 41:26.507
Yeah, he does.

41:29.344 --> 41:31.704
So, you wanna talk about it or you wanna forget about it?

41:31.817 --> 41:34.582
Well, there's nothing much to talk about. It was just bad.

41:34.837 --> 41:37.531
I got a little better as the night went on - talked a little more.

41:37.712 --> 41:42.282
He was very nice, just not my type. Oh, and the whole draft thing backfired.

41:42.395 --> 41:42.902
How so?

41:43.039 --> 41:45.482
Well, I switched over to the other side of the table.

41:45.815 --> 41:49.077
Then he started to feel the same draft and came over to my side.

41:49.272 --> 41:51.415
- But we made up the draft. 
- The power of suggestion.

41:51.651 --> 41:54.371
- Boys are so malleable. 
- It just all seemed so forced.

41:54.570 --> 41:57.713
I mean, I felt like I was locked into the pointless societal ritual.

41:58.108 --> 41:59.270
- There has to be another way. 
- Luke and I were debating that.

41:59.531 --> 42:04.374
Luke thinks it's all about gut instinct - you know instantly if a person is right for you.

42:04.492 --> 42:07.161
I think you have to go through a lot to find a contender.

42:07.304 --> 42:08.866
And you've been very lucky with boys before.

42:09.003 --> 42:12.336
They were just always sort of there, but I think for the most part,

42:12.480 --> 42:15.498
- a girl's got to hunt a little. 
- And go through a lot of non-contenders.

42:15.590 --> 42:18.706
Yes, then the non-contenders become your fun bad-date anecdotes.

42:18.777 --> 42:20.826
In fact, on your next date, if you're stuck for a topic,

42:20.938 --> 42:23.452
- tell him about your bad date. 
- But what if that date is bad?

42:23.590 --> 42:26.617
- Then you have an anecdote for your next date. 
- And how long does this go on?

42:26.775 --> 42:28.568
You've seen "Grey Gardens." It could go on forever.

42:28.674 --> 42:30.763
- Oh, well, just shoot me now. 
- Hang in there.

42:30.938 --> 42:33.461
- Go with Luke's gut thing if all else fails. 
- Maybe.

42:46.013 --> 42:47.946
I think my clothes were in there.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.189
Oh, yeah, somebody had already dumped them out,

42:50.260 --> 42:52.759
so I put 'em in my basket to keep 'em clean. Hope you don't mind.

42:53.086 --> 42:54.371
No. Thanks.

42:54.696 --> 42:57.341
Wow, that's the coolest laundry basket I've ever seen. I love The Smiths.

42:58.416 --> 43:00.167
I had an older brother that got me into them,

43:00.225 --> 43:02.021
and when my friends were listening to Hootie and the Blowfish,

43:02.103 --> 43:03.629
I was memorizing "Meat is Murder."

43:03.721 --> 43:05.764
Well, I have a mom who's pretty much cooler than anyone you'd meet,

43:05.841 --> 43:08.831
- and she did the same thing. 
- Mine's a plain old soccer mom, but she's great.

43:09.563 --> 43:13.220
Well, being away like this makes you think about stuff like that, doesn't it - home?

43:13.592 --> 43:14.145
Totally.

43:20.078 --> 43:22.824
Hey, would you maybe wanna get a cup of coffee sometime,

43:23.490 --> 43:24.815
in between classes or something?

43:26.213 --> 43:28.559
I don't think so, but thanks.

43:31.149 --> 43:31.886
You're welcome.
