OH, SO WHAT?

00:19.153 --> 00:20.621

I CAN'T HELP IT.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.324
IT CREEPS ME OUT.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.226
IT'S EVIL.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.062
HEY, BABE. WHAT ARE

00:28.096 --> 00:29.797
I GOTTA CHANGE MY DRESS

00:29.830 --> 00:32.333

00:40.874 --> 00:42.410
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:42.443 --> 00:45.146
I COLLIDED WITH A BUSBOY.
I'M SO FRAZZLED.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.115
I WORKED, LIKE,
8 SHIFTS IN A ROW.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.349
BABY, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW,

00:48.382 --> 00:50.151
BUT WE NEED

00:50.184 --> 00:50.851
YOU THINK I LIKE
GOING TO WORK

00:50.884 --> 00:52.720

00:52.753 --> 00:53.687

00:53.721 --> 00:54.622

VACATION

00:54.655 --> 00:56.090

00:59.127 --> 01:03.097

01:09.270 --> 01:13.807
OH, GOD, SEAN.
HAND ME THE BUG SPRAY.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.209
CAN WE GO HOME?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.377

01:16.410 --> 01:18.279
NO, WE CAN'T
GO HOME, MISSY, OK?

01:18.312 --> 01:19.880
THIS IS OUR VACATION.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.814
SO, CHANGE

01:20.848 --> 01:21.649
LOOKIT, LOOK,

THE KIDS, YOU KNOW?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.595
BY THE TIME I GET UP
IN THE MORNING
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL,

01:34.628 --> 01:36.297
AND BY THE TIME
I GET HOME, THEY'RE IN BED.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.232
HEY, HEY, THE KIDS

01:38.266 --> 01:39.567
AND THEY'RE
GONNA LOVE US
FOR GIVING THEM

01:39.600 --> 01:41.502
THE BEST VACATION

01:41.535 --> 01:44.738
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HEY, LIL.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.673
HEY, I HAVEN'T

01:45.706 --> 01:48.276
COME SIT DOWN

01:51.212 --> 01:52.180
WHY WON'T LILY

01:52.213 --> 01:52.946
AH, IT'S, YOU KNOW,

I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.084
ARE YOU SURE?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.519
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IF SHE
HAD SOMETHING GOIN' ON

01:58.552 --> 02:00.688
SHE'D BE

02:00.721 --> 02:03.157
YEAH, WHEN JIMMY
HAD HIS PROBLEM,

02:03.191 --> 02:04.492
HE WAS REALLY
UP FRONT ABOUT IT.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.360
WHAT? JIMMY
HAD A PROBLEM?

02:06.394 --> 02:08.729
NO, HE, OH,
A MINOR PROBLEM,

02:08.762 --> 02:10.731
BUT IT'S BEEN
DEALT WITH.

02:10.764 --> 02:14.202
THERE WAS AN
INCIDENT AT SCHOOL.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.213
OH, I'M SORRY.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.614
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE GARBAGE.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.317
WOULD YOU PLEASE
NOT DO THAT?

02:29.350 --> 02:30.851
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.686
I SAID, UH, COULD

02:32.720 --> 02:34.688

02:45.233 --> 02:45.999

02:46.033 --> 02:47.268
IT IS, IT IS,
BUT I TOOK CARE OF IT.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.470
DON'T WORRY, OK?
THE KIDS ARE FINE.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.939
DO YOU PROMISE?

02:51.972 --> 02:53.441
OK.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.976
I GOTTA GET

02:56.009 --> 02:57.645

03:08.389 --> 03:10.324
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR TONGUE?

03:10.358 --> 03:11.492
NOTHING.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.493
NOTHING, NOTHING.
BUT I SAW--

03:12.526 --> 03:16.364

I PIERCED IT, OK?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.299
OH.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.833
NO, NO, NO,
IT IS NOT OK.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.669
HOW COULD YOU
DO SOMETHING THAT STUPID?

03:21.702 --> 03:25.439
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT COOL IS.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.261
WELL, LILY'S LOCKED
HERSELF IN THE BATHROOM,

03:47.295 --> 03:49.930
BUT SHE ASSURES ME
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY THUPER.

03:49.963 --> 03:50.798
OH, GOOD.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.334
I CAN'T FIND MY CLEAN
CLOTHES FOR WORK.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.568
YOU PICKED UP

03:54.602 --> 03:56.737
OH, YEAH, RIGHT,

04:09.617 --> 04:14.288
THEY JUST LEAVE 'EM

04:15.689 --> 04:19.293
THEY'RE NICE AND CRUNCHY.

04:21.629 --> 04:22.896
UH, HEY.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.673
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.976
WE DIDN'T THINK
WE HAD TO, HONEY.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.680
IT'S LIKE DRINKING
OUT OF THE TOILET.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.550
OH, GREAT. ANOTHER RULE.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.898
OK, THIS COULD BE

DRINKS ARE SO BIG,

05:10.944 --> 05:13.581

AND THEN YOU AND ME,
WE'RE WALKIN' DOWN
THE BEACH AT SUNSET...

05:18.118 --> 05:19.653

05:19.687 --> 05:21.789
KIDS ARE UPSTAIRS
IN THEIR ROOMS SLEEPING,

05:21.822 --> 05:26.927
AND IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
AND THE CRYSTAL CLEAR WATERS.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.796
NOBODY WANTED
THIS BEAR CLAW, RIGHT?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.898
I CAN GET IT, YEAH?

05:32.466 --> 05:33.567
WHY, WHY, WHY?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.869
WHY DO YOU HAVE

05:35.903 --> 05:37.705
FINE, YOU HAVE IT.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.706
OH, UGH.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.809
YOU'RE THROWIN' AWAY
A PERFECTLY GOOD
BEAR CLAW?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.478
YOU WANT IT?
YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.480

OH, GOD.
OK, JUST TELL ME

05:53.621 --> 05:55.456

05:56.757 --> 05:57.925
OK OR GOOD?

05:57.958 --> 05:58.726
GOOD, NOW.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.861

THINGS WERE SHAKY.

06:00.894 --> 06:05.132
OK, LISTEN, BUDDY,
I'M GONNA HANDLE

BROTHER TO SCHOOL

06:10.103 --> 06:12.005

NOTHING HAPPENS TO HIM?

06:12.039 --> 06:12.606
YEAH, SURE.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.850
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
RUN AWAY AGAIN?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.052
"MY BAD. MY BAD. MY BAD."

06:27.755 --> 06:29.657
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.860
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND HIM.

06:32.893 --> 06:37.397
OH, BUT IT'S NOT.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.034
UNH.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.441
WOW, YEAH.
THAT'S MY GIRL.

06:47.475 --> 06:51.078
YEAH, SHE'S A SCRAPPER
JUST LIKE HER GRANDMA.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.181
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE SENDING LILY IN
TO FIGHT HIS BATTLES

06:54.214 --> 06:57.017
WASN'T THE SMARTEST IDEA.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.791
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER NOW?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.532
Sean: SISTER HELEN.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.534
I HAVE OFFICE HOURS,
MR. FINNERTY.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.537
YEAH, WELL,

07:17.505 --> 07:19.239
OK, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF OPERATION

07:19.272 --> 07:20.641
YOU'RE RUNNING

BEATEN OUT OF HIM

07:23.076 --> 07:24.011
ON A DAILY BASIS.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.914
WE HAVE A POLICY AGAINST
FIGHTING HERE, JIMMY.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.948
OH, DON'T LOOK
AT ME.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.751
I'M A BIG FAN
OF THAT POLICY.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
GOOD.
WHOA, WHOA,
SISTER HELEN,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.921
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO DEAL WITH THIS, OK?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.490
THIS IS THE LAST THING
IN THE WORLD I NEED
RIGHT NOW.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.158
AND, UH, WHY IS THAT?

07:38.191 --> 07:40.127
WELL, ME AND THE WIFE
ARE WORKING CRAZY HOURS.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.096
WE'RE SAVING UP

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
WE'RE GOING
TO, UH, CANCÚN.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.067
IT'S IN
THE GULF OF MEXICO.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.069
WELL, I'LL NEED
JIMMY TO IDENTIFY

07:49.102 --> 07:50.103
THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE
BEEN DOING THIS,

07:50.137 --> 07:53.974
AND, UH, BY THE WAY,
CANCÚN IS IN THE CARIBBEAN,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.275
NOT THE GULF OF MEXICO.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.645
BUT I CAN'T RAT
ON THOSE GUYS.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.246
IT'S SOME KID
NAMED KYLE, BUT--HEY.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.049
I DO, UH, I KNOW
IT'S THE GULF OF MEXICO

08:02.082 --> 08:03.116
BECAUSE I HAVE
THE BROCHURE AT HOME.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.686
WELL, MR. FINNERTY,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.820

08:06.854 --> 08:09.890

08:09.923 --> 08:12.259
IF BY "THEY"
YOU MEAN "GOD,"

08:12.292 --> 08:14.795
YES, HE DOES
LET ME GO TO CANCÚN.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.031
WOW, ISN'T IT ALL,

08:24.104 --> 08:26.574
OH, OF COURSE. I MEAN,

EVERYBODY BATHES.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.843
IT'S JUST--I--I--
YOU KNOW, I MEANT

08:29.877 --> 08:31.311
I DON'T WEAR A THONG.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.114
UM, SO, ARE YOU
GONNA TELL KYLE

08:34.147 --> 08:34.915

08:34.948 --> 08:36.016
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING, JIMMY,

08:36.049 --> 08:39.753
AND I HOPE YOU ALL
ENJOY YOUR TRIP
TO THE CARIBBEAN.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.755
UH, THE GULF OF MEXICO.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.891
ISN'T IT
"CARIBBEAN?"

08:43.924 --> 08:45.058
YES, IT IS, HENRY.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.860
BOTH ARE ACCEPTABLE.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.029
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

08:49.062 --> 08:49.863
SO, I HANDLED IT,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.665
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN
A PROBLEM SINCE.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.133
WELL, THANK GOD.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.136

ALL THAT. POOR JIMMY.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.806
POOR JIMMY?
WHAT ABOUT ME?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.008
OH, NO, NO,
NO ONE ASKED YOU

09:01.041 --> 09:02.242
TO GET
YOUR TONGUE PIERCED.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.811
I HAD NO THOICE.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.878
YOU HAD NO WHAT?

09:04.912 --> 09:07.748
THOICE. NO THOICE.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.051
YOU HAD NO TOYS?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.320

09:14.221 --> 09:17.124
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
SHE WAS SAYING
SHE HAD NO CHOICE.

09:17.157 --> 09:22.095
EXACTLY. IT WAS
SELF-PRESERVATION.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.366
HEY, GUYS.
DOES ANYBODY HAVE

09:26.399 --> 09:28.035
THE BIO NOTES
I CAN COPY?

09:28.068 --> 09:28.802
UH-OH.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
ARE YOU GONNA
BEAT US UP FOR THEM?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.106
WHAT?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.007
OH, I FORGOT.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.777
YOU ONLY BEAT UP
11-YEAR-OLDS,
DON'T YOU?

09:41.749 --> 09:42.850
THEY WERE MAKING
FUN OF ME.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.853
I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF
COOL AGAIN.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.089
WELL, WHY STOP
WITH YOUR TONGUE?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
PUT A BOLT
THROUGH YOUR NECK,

09:50.257 --> 09:53.193
YOU'LL BE QUEEN
OF THE PROM.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.629
I WAS
THE LAUGHING STOCK.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.830
I WAS DESPERATE.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.699
Girl: OH,
THAT IS SO COOL.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.801
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.237
YOU THINK THAT'S COOL?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.807
NO WAY.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.242
OH, YEAH.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.851
THAT THING HURT
LIKE A BITH.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.153
HEY, WATCH
THE MOUTH, MISS.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.223
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU DID THIS.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.357
HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.759
I GOT A PIERCING ONCE.

10:25.793 --> 10:29.196
OH, PFFT.
THAT WENT OVER WELL.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.801
WHOA.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.103
HEY, RICKY,
MRS. DELVECCHIO,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.771
CHECK ME OUT.
YOU LIKE?

10:37.805 --> 10:38.772
YOU LIKE IT, RIGHT?

10:38.806 --> 10:41.775
AH, AH, AH,
AH, OW, OW.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.210
AH, OH.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.378
HOLD STILL,
HOLD STILL.

10:45.412 --> 10:49.216
AAH! IT HURTS
LIKE CRAZY! AAH!

10:49.249 --> 10:52.152
I MADE QUITE A STATEMENT
WITH THAT CHAIN.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.222
YOU HAD IT FOR AN HOUR.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.858
YEAH, BUT BACK THEN,
IT WAS REBELLIOUS.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.292
IT'S NOT LIKE TODAY
WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET

10:59.326 --> 11:02.195
A PERMISSION SLIP
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.867
YOU NEED
A PERMISSION SLIP?

11:06.900 --> 11:10.871
I HAD A PERMISSION SLIP.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.274
OH, SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I OVERSLEPT.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.809
COME ON, I'LL MAKE YOU GUYS
SOME BREAKFAST, OK?

11:15.843 --> 11:18.311
WELL, NO, MOM.
I GOTTA BE AT SCHOOL
IN 5 MINUTES.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.881
OK, HAVE
A GOOD DAY, HENRY.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.782
I'M JIMMY.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.383
MOM, CAN YOU SIGN THIS?
MY CLASS IS GOING

11:23.416 --> 11:25.886
ON A FIELD TRIP
TO ELLIS ISLAND.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921
THAT'S GOOD.
HAVE FUN, BABE.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.289
I WILL.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.291
COFFEE.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.760
YOU LIED TO ME?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.427
NO, WE ARE GOING
TO ELLIS ISLAND.

11:34.461 --> 11:39.699
I DIDN'T IMPLY
THAT THE 2 THINGS
WERE RELATED.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.201
HMM-HMM-HMM.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.936
I'M GONNA WAIT FOR
THAT TONGUE TO HEAL,

11:42.970 --> 11:44.004
AND THEN
I'M GONNA PULL IT

11:44.037 --> 11:45.272
RIGHT OUT
OF HER HEAD.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.440
I'LL HOLD HER DOWN.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.376
MAN, IF I HAD BEEN
WORKING REGULAR HOURS,

11:49.409 --> 11:50.543
THAT WOULD NEVER
HAVE GOTTEN BY ME.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.813
LOOK, BABY, IF YOU WANT
TO WORK REGULAR HOURS,
GO AHEAD.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.081
WE'LL JUST TAKE
THE SAME OLD
REGULAR VACATION.

11:54.114 --> 11:58.051
WE'LL GO BACK
TO THE JERSEY SHORE
LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.754
PFFT.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.255
NICE DAY, HUH?

12:02.289 --> 12:03.757
WELL, IT'S HOT.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.425
MMM.
GOOD NEWS,
FOLKS.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.127
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE GOT IT TRAPPED

12:07.160 --> 12:08.361
BEHIND
THE MINI FRIDGE.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.329
WE SPRAYED IT UP
PRETTY GOOD,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.164
BUT IT'S STILL
KINDA SNAPPIN',

12:11.198 --> 12:12.933
SO, I'D WAIT
ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO

12:12.966 --> 12:15.268
BEFORE YOU GO
BACK IN.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.074
WHEN CAN WE
GO BACK INSIDE?

12:21.108 --> 12:21.909
UM, UH...

12:21.942 --> 12:25.012
WELL, WHEN THE THING
IN THERE STOPS...

12:25.045 --> 12:26.013
SNAPPING.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.480
SNAPPING.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.916
OH, GOD, NOT THAT AGAIN.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.952
SEE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE WORKIN' SO HARD.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.523
THERE'S SOMEONE
AT THE DOOR!

12:36.556 --> 12:39.359
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.430
AH! JIMMY,
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

12:43.463 --> 12:46.299
SEE, SISTER?
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS TALKIN' ABOUT.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.968
YOU WERE RIGHT,
MR. FINNERTY.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.270
THERE IS A BULLY PROBLEM
AT SCHOOL.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.005
YEAH, OK, I TRIED
TO TELL YOU THAT.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.842
THE BULLY IS YOUR SON.

12:55.308 --> 12:55.943
I HURT MY HAND

12:55.976 --> 12:58.245
PUNCHING A GUY
IN THE TEETH.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.516
JIMMY CAN'T
BE THE BULLY.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.152
HE'S NEVER
HURT ANYONE.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.987
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I'M LYING?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.055
NO, NO.
W-W-W-W-WAIT.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.022
JIMMY
WAS THE ONE

13:09.056 --> 13:10.190
WHO WAS GETTING
PICKED ON.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.059
OH, OH, NO,
NOT ANY MORE.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.895
I KICKED SOME
SERIOUS ASS.

13:14.928 --> 13:15.795
JIMMY.

13:15.829 --> 13:16.596
HEY, HEY, JIMMY.
LET'S GO
INTO THE KITCHEN

13:16.629 --> 13:18.365
AND MAKE
SISTER HELEN
SOME TEA, OK?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.133
WHY?
COME ON!

13:20.167 --> 13:25.172
UM, YOU KNOW, I JUST
GOT MADE AN USHER

13:25.205 --> 13:29.309
OH, THAT'S NICE.

13:31.945 --> 13:36.016
JIMMY, TELL ME WHAT
THE HELL HAPPENED
IN SCHOOL.

13:36.049 --> 13:36.649
HENRY...

13:36.683 --> 13:39.386
W-W-WHERE'D

13:40.954 --> 13:43.056
I EARNED IT.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.308
HENRY, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.143
OH, SO FIRST
I'M NOT ALLOWED

14:03.176 --> 14:04.277
TO ROOT THROUGH
DUMPSTERS,

14:04.311 --> 14:07.380
AND NOW I'M NOT
ALLOWED TO BEG FOR FOOD.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.884
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO EAT?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.285
I COOK FOR YOU.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.288
MACARONI AND CHEESE.
IT'S ALL YOU EVER MAKE.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.423
YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU LOVE IT.

14:16.456 --> 14:20.627
I USED TO. WE ATE IT
6 DAYS IN A ROW.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.330
HENRY, HOOK ME UP
WITH A DUMPLING.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.597
HEY, I DANCED FOR 'EM.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.533
YEAH, YOUR DANCIN'
DAYS ARE OVER.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.503
YEAH, AND HEY, BUDDY,

14:32.405 --> 14:35.175
COME ON, JIMMY.
WHAT HAPPENED, HUH?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.210
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
BEATIN' GUYS UP?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.045
I HAD TO. I MEAN,

14:38.078 --> 14:41.148
AFTER DAD
GOT SISTER HELEN
INVOLVED.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.550
WAIT, I--I THOUGHT
SHE WOULD TAKE CARE
OF THINGS.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.420
OH, YEAH. SHE DID
TAKE CARE OF THINGS.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.422
OW! OW!

14:49.456 --> 14:51.925
KYLE WON'T BOTHER
YOU AGAIN, JIMMY.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.495
I'm gonna get you.
OW!

15:01.601 --> 15:02.702
OH, GOD.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.504
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME TO ME?

15:04.537 --> 15:07.407
I DID, AND YOU
JUST MADE IT WORSE,

15:07.440 --> 15:10.343
SO I WENT
TO UNCLE EDDIE.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.348
I JUST HAPPENED
TO BE AROUND.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.617
OK, SEE THIS GUY?

15:17.650 --> 15:18.485
HE'S NOT LOOKIN'
FOR A FIGHT.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.653
HE'S--HE'S FILLED
WITH INNER PEACE,

15:20.687 --> 15:24.992
BUT THESE OTHER GUYS
FROM THE CHOW LIN PROVINCE

15:25.025 --> 15:27.427
ARE GONNA PUSH HIM
TOO FAR,

15:27.460 --> 15:29.997
BUT RIGHT NOW,
HE'S JUST TAKIN' IT.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.165
JUST--LOOKIT, THEY JUST
BROKE HIS BOWL.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.302
THEY HUMILIATED HIM,
AND HE'S JUST
SITTIN' THERE TAKIN' IT.

15:35.335 --> 15:39.339
THE FORTITUDE
OF THIS GUY,
JUST TAKIN' IT.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.741
JUST TAKING IT.
YEAH, I'M GONNA
FAST FORWARD

15:41.774 --> 15:43.710
'CAUSE THIS IS BORING.
HE'S TAKING IT.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.046
HE TAKES IT FOR A WHILE.

15:46.079 --> 15:50.617
SEE, ALL MARSHAL ARTS
ARE BASED ON THE SAME
BASIC PRINCIPLES:

15:50.650 --> 15:52.719
SURPRISE
AND MISDIRECTION.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.721
NOW, SAY YOU WERE
GONNA KICK ME.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.090
SHOW ME HOW
YOU WOULD DO IT.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.491
NO, NO,

15:58.525 --> 15:59.759
NO, YOU'RE BEING
OBVIOUS.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.229
THIS IS HOW
STEVEN SEAGAL
WOULD DO IT.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.531
THIS LAND BELONGS
TO THE ESKIMOS,

16:04.564 --> 16:06.266
AND I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU--

16:06.299 --> 16:08.101
BOOM!

16:09.169 --> 16:13.040
THIS GUY IS DOWN,
AND HE'S NOT
GETTING UP...

16:13.073 --> 16:14.641
'CAUSE
I MISDIRECTED HIM
BY LOOKING OVER

16:14.674 --> 16:16.243
AT THIS GUY
OVER HERE,

16:16.276 --> 16:17.477
AND THEN
I SURPRISED HIM

16:17.510 --> 16:18.245
BY KICKING HIM

16:18.278 --> 16:19.112
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY ESKIMO SPEECH.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.748
OK, ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS--

16:21.781 --> 16:23.550
YAH!

16:23.583 --> 16:26.419
YOU LEARN QUICKLY,
MY YOUNG--OOH!

16:26.453 --> 16:29.156
MAN, I CAN REALLY GO

16:29.189 --> 16:30.390
YAH!

16:30.423 --> 16:32.359
FINISH HIM OFF,
YOU KNOW?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.360
WAA!

16:33.393 --> 16:34.561
YEAH, NO MERCY.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.697
EDDIE'S RAISING
OUR SON.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.233
UH, NOT EXACTLY.
HE--

16:40.267 --> 16:41.068
SEAN!

16:41.101 --> 16:43.503
EDDIE IS RAISING

16:43.536 --> 16:46.273
our son.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.006
BABY, BABY.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.343
A SIMPLE THANK YOU
WOULD BE NICE.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.644
UH, NO, NO, BABY.
JUST--JUST--

16:51.678 --> 16:55.215
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
JUST--JUST KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE PRIZE, OK,

16:55.248 --> 16:59.252
AND THEN WE CAN BE HERE--
HERE, US, ON THE BEACH.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.722
OH, CRYSTAL CLEAR WATERS
LAPPING AT OUR TOES,

17:02.755 --> 17:05.458
FRIENDLY NATIVES ATTENDING
TO OUR EVERY WHIM.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.394
WAIT, LOOK.
THERE'S OUR CHILDREN.

17:07.427 --> 17:10.130
THEY'RE HAVING
SUCH A GREAT TIME.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.499
THIS IS SO FANTASTIC.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.302
I'VE NEVER FELT
LESS SURLY IN MY LIFE.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.569
I LOVE YOU,
MOM.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.671
WE'RE GONNA
LEARN ABOUT
CORAL REEFS.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.739
OH, YOU GUYS
GO DO

17:19.772 --> 17:22.642
WHATEVER
IT IS YOU
WANNA DO.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.648
PARDON ME...

17:28.681 --> 17:30.283
BUT I'M DOUBLE PARKED.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.284
OH, UH, HUH?

17:31.318 --> 17:32.485
CAN WE PLEASE
FINISH THIS?

17:32.519 --> 17:35.288
UM, OH, YEAH.
I'M SORRY, SISTER.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.357
I WAS JUST MAKING
YOU, UH, TEA.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.725
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
ASK FOR TEA.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.693
I KNOW. I JUST MADE IT.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.429
YEAH, I DON'T WANT TEA.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.298
OK, UH...

17:45.332 --> 17:46.199
LOOK, LOOK,
SISTER HELEN,

17:46.233 --> 17:47.700
I'M SORRY IF HE GOT
INVOLVED IN SOMETHING,

17:47.734 --> 17:50.303
BUT YOU KNOW JIMMY.
THIS ISN'T LIKE HIM.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.405
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE SCHOOL YARD TODAY

17:52.439 --> 17:53.673
WAS A VERY UGLY SCENE.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.842
WELL, I WASN'T
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

17:55.875 --> 18:02.215
I WAS JUST SITTING THERE,
AND ENJOYING MY INNER PEACE.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.618
WELL, WELL. LOOK
WHO'S READING A BOOK.

18:05.652 --> 18:10.523
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF GIRL BOOK, GIRLIE, HUH?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.326
OOPS, LOOKS LIKE
YOU DROPPED YOUR BOOK.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.330
YOU ARE REALLY
TESTING MY INNER PEACE.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.201
AAH! OW! OW! OW!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.575
UNH!
UNH!
UNH!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.606
OH! OOH!

19:08.315 --> 19:09.849
OH.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.734
GOOD LORD.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.272
I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK
JIMMY MAY BE EMBELLISHING.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.509
OH, NO. I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK--NO.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.810
I SAW IT.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.712
Kyle: ONE DAY HE,
UH, ESCAPED,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.648
AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW,
THEY WENT IN OUR FRUIT TREE

19:41.681 --> 19:45.285
AND THEY ATE EVERY PIECE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.653
AAH!

19:49.522 --> 19:51.558
Kids: GO, JIMMY!
GO, JIMMY!

19:51.591 --> 19:53.560

19:53.593 --> 19:54.761
GO, JIMMY! GO, JIMMY!

19:54.794 --> 19:58.498
GO, JIMMY!
GO, JIMMY! GO, JIMMY!

19:58.531 --> 20:00.233
EITHER WAY, GOOD JOB.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.934
THANKS.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:01.968 --> 20:02.869
NOT A GOOD JOB, OK?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.471
ALL RIGHT. FIGHTING
DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.639
IT--IT--IT'S STUPID
AND IT'S WRONG.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.540
IT'S DANGEROUS.
YES.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.376
YES, AND--AND I PROMISE
YOU, SISTER HELEN,

20:09.409 --> 20:13.613
WE WILL HANDLE THIS,
'CAUSE WE'RE
GOOD PARENTS, REALLY.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.481
WELL, I HOPE SO.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.683
I'M GOING TO BE KEEPING
MY EYE ON JIMMY.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.950
AS WILL WE.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.252
DO WE HAVE
SOME ANTISEPTIC?

20:19.286 --> 20:21.321
THIS IS REALLY
STINGING.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.328
WHAT'S THAT
IN YOUR TONGUE?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.596
NOTHING, SISTER.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.765
I'LL SEE YOU
IN DETENTION.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.802
OH, CRAP.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.607
ADIOS, CANCÚN.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.541
I'M CALLIN' WORK.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.909
SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE MY SHIFT.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.644
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA CANCEL

20:44.677 --> 20:46.679
MY SHIFT TOMORROW, TOO.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.582
CANCÚN WILL BE THERE
WHEN WE'RE
RETIRED, RIGHT?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.451
OH, SWEETIE,
I DO NOT WANNA SEE

20:51.484 --> 20:55.588
YOUR BIG, WHITE,
65-YEAR-OLD ASS
ON A DIVING BOARD.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.359
JUST FOR THAT,
I'M WEARIN' A SPEEDO.

20:59.392 --> 21:03.296
OOH. YUCK.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.897
COME ON,
WE'LL HAVE A NICE
VACATION, RIGHT?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.368
YEAH, WE'LL
DO SOMETHIN' FUN.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.338
THIS ISN'T SO BAD.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.940
NO, BABE. YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE FAN.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.343
THE FAN MAKES
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.045
YOU KNOW, I BET YOU
IT'S RAINING IN CANCÚN
RIGHT NOW.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.514
PHEW. DODGED

21:21.548 --> 21:22.782
HEY, HEY.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.952
OH, WOW, THAT'S NEAT.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.821
YOU GOT A STARFISH,
AND A CLAM SHELL, AND--

21:28.855 --> 21:30.657
OH! OH, MY GOD.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.892
GO WASH YOUR HANDS.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.895
AH, THAT OCEAN
IS REFRESHING.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.676
FAN ROCKS, HUH?

21:49.709 --> 21:50.943
FAN ROCKS.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.979
LIFE'S GOOD.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.648
YEP.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.386
NO! NO, NO.
COME ON, DAD.
JUST COME AT ME.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.421
NO.
COME ON, I GOT
THIS GREAT NEW MOVE.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.723
JUST COME AND TRY
TO KNOCK ME DOWN.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.625
OK, OK, OK.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.359
AAH!

22:06.393 --> 22:07.594
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY!

22:07.627 --> 22:08.828

22:08.861 --> 22:10.597

22:12.499 --> 22:13.566

22:15.802 --> 22:17.504

22:17.537 --> 22:19.739

22:21.774 --> 22:22.542

22:22.575 --> 22:23.976

22:24.010 --> 22:24.944
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.380
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.
