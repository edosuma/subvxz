No, no, no, this is all wrong.

02:16.510 --> 02:18.877
Forks go on the left,
knives on the right.

02:18.879 --> 02:21.480
Am I the only one who cares
about throwing a good party?

02:21.482 --> 02:23.383
Yes, McKenna,
you're the only one

02:23.385 --> 02:24.817
who cares about the party.

02:24.819 --> 02:27.152
None of us could possibly
care as much as you.

02:27.154 --> 02:29.121
What are forks even for?

02:29.123 --> 02:31.858
Emilyn, that cake
is for the party.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.460
Relax, that's the
keep Emilyn away

02:33.462 --> 02:35.694
from the real cake cake.

02:35.696 --> 02:39.198
Don't worry, I won't let
her ruin the real cake.

02:41.503 --> 02:42.769
That's the let Harper think

02:42.771 --> 02:45.371
she's guarding the
real cake cake.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.343
Aleeda put me in charge

02:51.345 --> 02:52.912
while she went to
the wedding ceremony,

02:52.914 --> 02:55.448
and she said that everything
has to be perfect, so I...

02:55.450 --> 02:58.354
Hey, where do
you guys want this?

02:59.487 --> 03:03.526
Finally,
something done right.

03:06.861 --> 03:08.228
Whoa.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.196
Would you look at the
size of that thing?

03:10.198 --> 03:12.132
It must be worth a fortune.

03:12.134 --> 03:14.537
Or at least a lot of money.

03:21.543 --> 03:25.210
From your first
breath to my last.

03:25.212 --> 03:28.080
Aleeda wants to give it to
them as soon as they get here.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.182
Now, if they show up right
after the wedding ceremony,

03:30.184 --> 03:33.019
the sun should be
directly above us,

03:33.021 --> 03:36.256
so that will make the
optimal placement.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.893
Stop being so smart
and hang it on the rock.

03:39.895 --> 03:41.093
Be careful.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.728
Aleeda spent months on that.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.732
Relax, everything
is taken care of.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.542
Do you think they'll like it?

03:55.544 --> 03:57.644
Of course, it's perfect.

03:57.646 --> 03:59.978
That's
enough admiration.

03:59.980 --> 04:03.015
We still have plenty
of work to do.

04:03.017 --> 04:06.485
Now, what time did Aleeda
say they're coming?

04:06.487 --> 04:07.656
They're not.

04:12.527 --> 04:15.160
I've reevaluated our priorities.

04:15.162 --> 04:16.628
We've wasted far too
much time on them,

04:16.630 --> 04:19.363
so I'm cancelling the party.

04:19.366 --> 04:20.366
What do you mean?

04:20.368 --> 04:22.268
What happened?

04:22.270 --> 04:24.003
Nothing happened.

04:24.005 --> 04:27.674
Fairies belong in the forest
and humans belong out there.

04:27.676 --> 04:29.241
But, Aleeda,
you've always said...

04:29.243 --> 04:31.376
No fairy will have
any contact with humans

04:31.378 --> 04:33.246
from this day forward.

04:33.248 --> 04:35.851
Aleeda, what about your gift?

04:41.522 --> 04:44.859
Leave it as a
reminder of our mistake.

04:50.364 --> 04:51.797
Is that it?

04:51.799 --> 04:53.566
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

04:53.568 --> 04:55.068
If Aleeda says we aren't,

04:55.070 --> 04:57.470
then that's the way it will be.

04:57.472 --> 04:58.638
Now, throw out the cake

04:58.640 --> 05:01.006
and start taking
down the decorations.

05:28.303 --> 05:32.472
My Pop was the most
stubborn man I know.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.974
When I was nine we moved
to the city for Mom's work,

05:34.976 --> 05:38.076
and I didn't wanna leave my Pop,

05:38.078 --> 05:39.412
'cause he was was
my whole world,

05:39.414 --> 05:42.080
but he told me it'd be all right

05:42.082 --> 05:45.350
because if you love something,

05:45.352 --> 05:49.087
truly love something, than
nothing can keep you apart.

05:49.089 --> 05:50.590
I thought he was
just being nice,

05:50.592 --> 05:54.626
but when we got there there
was a computer waiting for me

05:54.628 --> 05:58.597
with a note that said,
"Because I truly love you,"

05:58.599 --> 06:02.969
and a P.S., "As soon as I
figure out how this works,

06:02.971 --> 06:04.306
"I'll call you."

06:05.940 --> 06:09.609
After a day of cursing
and phone calls,

06:09.611 --> 06:13.111
my Pop figured out how to
call me on the computer,

06:13.113 --> 06:16.719
and every day after
that without exception.

06:19.154 --> 06:20.486
He helped
me with my homework,

06:20.488 --> 06:23.422
and he'd send me silly
videos on my birthday.

06:23.424 --> 06:27.595
He'd just listen
to me if I wanted to talk.

06:29.763 --> 06:33.936
He was my best friend, and
I'm really gonna miss him.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.207
The worst part was finding
out that my Pop was wrong,

06:41.209 --> 06:44.380
because no matter
how much I love him,

06:49.116 --> 06:51.751
he can't come back!

06:51.753 --> 06:53.087
Sweetie, wait!

07:02.229 --> 07:05.301
Not having fun at
the party, petal?

07:11.072 --> 07:13.373
It's not party,
Gam, it's a funeral.

07:15.710 --> 07:19.878
Sounds like someone
should tell them that.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.181
How come you're not sad?

07:22.183 --> 07:23.752
Don't you miss him?

07:25.152 --> 07:26.385
The only time I miss someone

07:26.387 --> 07:30.491
is when I'll never see
them again.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.998
Just because you left the farm

07:39.000 --> 07:42.902
didn't mean I wouldn't
see you again, right?

07:42.904 --> 07:44.369
Not really the same thing.

07:44.371 --> 07:45.440
Sure it is.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.342
I believed I'd see you when
your mum moved you away,

07:50.344 --> 07:52.378
and here you are.

07:52.380 --> 07:56.215
Well, I wish we had a
better reason for coming back.

07:56.217 --> 07:57.383
Did I ever tell you

07:57.385 --> 07:59.751
about the time I
helped invent popcorn?

07:59.753 --> 08:00.585
No.

08:00.587 --> 08:03.289
Well, I was at a fair,

08:03.291 --> 08:05.090
and I had bumped
into a fire-eater

08:05.092 --> 08:07.225
who spat his fire
at the corn vendor.

08:07.227 --> 08:10.662
Oh, he was really angry
about losing his hair

08:10.664 --> 08:12.465
until the corn started popping.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.602
Gammy, did you
guys get horses?

08:17.604 --> 08:20.106
Oh no, dear, we
don't have horses.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.239
Oh.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.042
Do you still like horses?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.277
- I love them.
- Ah.

08:24.279 --> 08:25.611
Mom still
takes me for lessons,

08:25.613 --> 08:28.681
but it's inside, so
it's not the same.

08:28.683 --> 08:31.850
I really miss going on
the trails with Pop.

08:31.852 --> 08:34.354
Probably why he
got you this then.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.933
Gammy, but you just...

08:47.935 --> 08:50.168
We don't have horses.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.271
We just have this one.

08:55.209 --> 08:56.110
Hi there.

08:57.511 --> 09:00.879
Careful, honey,
Tanner's fussy.

09:00.881 --> 09:02.748
He's beautiful.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.518
Pop's the only one
who could take him out.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.686
Other tries, but Tanner
knows who he likes

09:07.688 --> 09:08.888
and who he doesn't.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.591
You miss
him too, don't you?

09:12.593 --> 09:15.164
He can see you have his eyes.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.731
I would
never hurt you.

09:19.733 --> 09:23.304
Looks like someone
has a new best friend.

09:27.007 --> 09:28.740
Hey, what are you doing?

09:28.742 --> 09:31.643
Mom, look, this is Tanner.

09:31.645 --> 09:32.845
Isn't he handsome?

09:32.847 --> 09:35.248
Yes, but can you
stay back from there?

09:35.250 --> 09:37.149
Mom, I ride them all the time.

09:37.151 --> 09:39.551
Well, that's different,
this is a farm horse.

09:42.189 --> 09:43.489
A farm horse?

09:43.491 --> 09:44.724
He was Pops's and
Gammy said that I...

09:44.726 --> 09:46.158
Amanda, we'll talk
about this later.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.064
The guests are leaving,
we have to say goodbye.

09:52.366 --> 09:53.832
Come on, sweetie.

09:53.834 --> 09:56.536
Let's say goodbye
to the party guests.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.978
And I will tell you all about
the time that I met Elvis,

10:04.478 --> 10:06.481
Oh, he was very handsome

10:11.919 --> 10:12.918
Thank you.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.755
Thank you.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.156
Condolences from our family.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.993
Take care.

10:19.427 --> 10:21.726
Charlie, thanks for coming.

10:21.728 --> 10:23.296
How could I miss this?

10:23.298 --> 10:24.330
My dad would've been so happy

10:24.332 --> 10:26.835
to see so many friendly faces.

10:28.369 --> 10:29.969
You and
Amanda staying long?

10:29.971 --> 10:31.771
No, we're
just here for the weekend.

10:31.773 --> 10:32.971
I've gotta go back to work.

10:32.973 --> 10:34.507
Sure.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.875
You think you could drop by
my office in the morning?

10:36.877 --> 10:39.077
There's just some
business to finish up.

10:39.079 --> 10:41.848
Sure thing, I'll
come by first thing.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.816
Do you still like
blueberry scones?

10:43.818 --> 10:46.451
I'll
wear my belt loose.

10:46.453 --> 10:48.553
Okay.

10:48.555 --> 10:49.891
- Bye.
- Take care.

10:54.661 --> 10:55.430
Mom?

10:56.698 --> 10:57.765
What is that?

10:58.799 --> 11:00.666
I have no idea.

11:00.668 --> 11:02.033
Can you help me
with the kitchen?

11:02.035 --> 11:04.539
I have to put some stuff away.

11:07.641 --> 11:08.709
Yeah, sure.

11:17.986 --> 11:21.155
Amanda, have you
seen my toothbrush?

11:24.491 --> 11:26.124
Oh.

11:26.126 --> 11:27.359
I don't have one on me,

11:27.361 --> 11:28.326
but there's a spare one in...

11:28.328 --> 11:29.829
What? Why?

11:29.831 --> 11:32.731
Patty, Patty, what
on earth are you doing?

11:32.733 --> 11:33.566
Mom, stay back.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.800
Amanda, call 911!

11:34.802 --> 11:36.869
Oh, for heaven's sake.

11:36.871 --> 11:38.336
- No, no, no.
- Dylan, Dylan.

11:38.338 --> 11:40.038
- Nope.
- Are you okay?

11:40.040 --> 11:41.139
Yeah.

11:41.141 --> 11:42.675
Mom, you know him?

11:42.677 --> 11:46.077
This is Dylan, he helps
me with the day-to-day.

11:46.079 --> 11:46.914
Oh.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.016
I'm so sorry.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.182
Ah, it's my fault.

11:51.184 --> 11:53.386
I thought you'd like
a hot bowl of oatmeal.

11:53.388 --> 11:55.687
Kinda regret the hot
part now, though.

11:55.689 --> 11:57.757
Mom, why didn't you
tell me about him?

11:57.759 --> 11:58.990
Because it's Dylan.

11:58.992 --> 12:00.493
He's always here.

12:00.495 --> 12:02.862
Oh, that clears that up then.

12:02.864 --> 12:04.062
Well, I'm off.

12:04.064 --> 12:06.632
I gotta go downtown
to see Charlie.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.133
I'll be back in a
couple of hours.

12:08.135 --> 12:11.637
Amanda, do me a favor
and make sure, um...

12:11.639 --> 12:13.272
Dylan, or intruder.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.873
You know, I'll answer to both.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.942
Okay, if you can help
Dylan get cleaned up,

12:16.944 --> 12:17.877
that'd be great.

12:17.879 --> 12:19.778
Um, then can I go see Tanner?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.681
No, sweetie, you've
gotta get ready.

12:21.683 --> 12:23.449
We've gotta get to
the airport on time.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.383
I thought we weren't
leaving until tomorrow.

12:25.385 --> 12:27.152
Sweetheart,
you've just go here.

12:27.154 --> 12:29.154
I know, but work called,
and I've got this mess

12:29.156 --> 12:30.388
- to clean up...
- Mom!

12:30.390 --> 12:32.724
Grownup
decisions, Amanda.

12:32.726 --> 12:34.560
All right, sorry about that...

12:34.562 --> 12:35.994
Violent oatmeal throwing?

12:35.996 --> 12:38.129
Yeah, no, it's fine.

12:38.131 --> 12:39.364
It's not fair.

12:39.366 --> 12:41.499
Come on, petal.

12:41.501 --> 12:43.005
It's not that bad.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.638
Oh, no, you guys go.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.139
I'll take care of this.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.580
So while it may look like
they're close sometimes,

12:55.582 --> 12:58.316
I promise they
are very far away.

12:58.318 --> 13:00.353
So neither of you have
to worry about the sun

13:00.355 --> 13:02.321
and the moon crashing
into each other.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.324
Huh, that actually
kept me up all night.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.695
Oh, now I'm sad, because they'll
never get to be together.

13:11.966 --> 13:14.367
Hey, wanna throw the disc
at the edge of the forest?

13:14.369 --> 13:15.200
Oh, yes!

13:15.202 --> 13:16.268
Can I pick teams?

13:16.270 --> 13:17.103
Sure.

13:17.105 --> 13:19.106
Okay, I choose Emilyn!

13:20.574 --> 13:23.042
I was so worried
you weren't gonna pick me.

13:23.044 --> 13:25.277
I felt like the
moon to your sun.

13:25.279 --> 13:26.878
I don't have a son.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.013
All right, let's go.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.481
Losing daylight.

13:29.483 --> 13:32.784
Wait, why do we have to play
at the edge of the forest?

13:32.786 --> 13:34.487
I don't know, just
more open space.

13:34.489 --> 13:36.522
You're trying
to see that girl.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.623
What?

13:37.625 --> 13:39.124
No.

13:39.126 --> 13:42.827
I just think that there'd be
better range for throwing.

13:42.829 --> 13:46.364
Tell me you just
aren't a tiny bit interested.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.298
I knew it.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.367
I'm going to tell Aleeda.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.634
Aren't you curious?

13:49.636 --> 13:51.704
Come on, you of all the fairies.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.439
All you do is study.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.307
Think of all the
things you could learn.

13:56.309 --> 13:58.244
Rules are rules.

13:58.246 --> 14:00.378
Well, what else would they be?

14:00.380 --> 14:01.681
And I'm not
interested in learning

14:01.683 --> 14:03.449
what they have to offer.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.584
Aleeda is quite
clear on this point.

14:05.586 --> 14:08.287
We're not going,
and that's final.

14:11.858 --> 14:13.325
Okay, forget her.

14:13.327 --> 14:15.027
Let's just fly out to
the edge and have a look.

14:15.029 --> 14:16.696
I promise, we'll just look.

14:16.698 --> 14:18.431
I don't know, Cali.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.398
I don't wanna get in trouble.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.933
Come with us.

14:21.935 --> 14:24.936
We'll tell you the sad story
about the sun and the moon.

14:24.938 --> 14:27.041
Nah, you guys go ahead.

14:33.548 --> 14:34.816
Good morning.

14:35.982 --> 14:38.183
Sorry, they didn't
have blueberry.

14:38.185 --> 14:41.186
Do I
look like I mind?

14:43.524 --> 14:44.525
Have a seat.

14:46.794 --> 14:49.130
Still the sheriff as well?

14:53.167 --> 14:54.867
No one else stupid
enough to do it.

14:58.072 --> 14:59.872
I remember when you
first walked in here.

14:59.874 --> 15:01.373
Do you remember that?

15:01.375 --> 15:03.808
I remember walking in
with my little piggy bank,

15:03.810 --> 15:06.045
telling you to draw up a
emancipation agreement.

15:06.047 --> 15:08.547
I
think you called it

15:08.549 --> 15:11.550
an exaggeration agreement.

15:11.552 --> 15:14.420
Coming in here acting like a
grownup at eight years old.

15:14.422 --> 15:17.355
Somebody had to act like
a grownup in that house.

15:17.357 --> 15:19.624
I guess your folks did
beat to their own drums.

15:19.626 --> 15:20.593
Drums?

15:20.595 --> 15:22.327
More like pots and pans.

15:24.164 --> 15:25.830
Well, I won't keep you long.

15:25.832 --> 15:27.066
I know you're a busy gal.

15:27.068 --> 15:29.634
Just a bit of paperwork
to make it all legal.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.138
Thanks, Charlie,

15:32.573 --> 15:36.142
You know, I just wanna get
my mom into someplace nice.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.042
How's that?

15:38.044 --> 15:41.479
Well, I looked at a
few retirement homes,

15:41.481 --> 15:45.654
and I'm not sure it's gonna be
an easy conversation to have.

15:47.221 --> 15:48.387
What?

15:48.389 --> 15:50.158
He didn't tell you.

15:51.592 --> 15:54.259
Tell me what? What did he do?

15:54.261 --> 15:57.866
Just your dad beating
those pots and pans.

16:00.433 --> 16:01.466
What?

16:01.468 --> 16:03.234
I don't understand.

16:03.236 --> 16:05.370
He left me the house?

16:05.372 --> 16:07.373
Why wouldn't he give it to Mom?

16:07.375 --> 16:11.546
I think it was
part of the bigger plan.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.614
He wants to make the place
into a bed and breakfast?

16:16.616 --> 16:18.683
As far as I know,
everything's been done.

16:18.685 --> 16:19.920
What?

16:21.087 --> 16:25.123
Your dad, he worked on
this for a whole year.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.758
He didn't tell you
anything about this?

16:30.164 --> 16:30.999
Dad.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.066
What did you do?

16:34.068 --> 16:36.837
Well, he did
make this for you.

16:47.814 --> 16:48.916
Hi, peanut.

16:50.483 --> 16:54.954
If you're seeing this, I'm
sorry to say, I've gone.

16:54.956 --> 16:57.089
Charlie, I bet you're wearing

16:57.091 --> 16:59.224
that silly green
tie, aren't you?

17:03.296 --> 17:08.067
I keep trying to tell
you, green is off-putting.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.534
I'm leaving you all my ties.

17:09.536 --> 17:10.769
There's only three of them,

17:10.771 --> 17:14.476
but all of them would
be better than that one.

17:15.642 --> 17:18.711
But by now I'm sure
Charlie's told you

17:18.713 --> 17:20.377
about my little surprise.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.146
I'm sorry to spring it
on you like this, peanut,

17:22.148 --> 17:26.320
but we both know that if I tried
to tell you about the idea,

17:27.521 --> 17:31.189
you'd just shut me down
before I even got going.

17:31.191 --> 17:34.392
I know I'm asking a lot of you,

17:34.394 --> 17:37.263
to come on home and
run a bed and breakfast

17:37.265 --> 17:39.333
with your mum and Amanda.

17:41.302 --> 17:44.805
But when I look at
everything you've done,

17:46.140 --> 17:49.710
I, quite frankly, I
couldn't be prouder of you.

17:51.111 --> 17:55.281
My little girl went off
and took on the whole world

17:55.283 --> 17:56.849
and beat them.

17:56.851 --> 18:01.753
And boy, I've loved being
in your cheering section.

18:01.755 --> 18:04.223
But I couldn't just
leave this world

18:04.225 --> 18:08.060
without giving you
and Amanda this gift,

18:08.062 --> 18:11.666
the gift of family,
because you deserve it.

18:12.832 --> 18:16.004
Just say the word if
you want to leave.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.039
Your mum doesn't
even know about it.

18:20.041 --> 18:23.979
Just tell Charlie and
he'll sell the place off,

18:25.880 --> 18:28.883
you go back to your
big city living.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.151
It's your call.

18:33.653 --> 18:36.254
How can I say no to that?

18:36.256 --> 18:38.023
I got her, didn't I?

18:38.025 --> 18:42.197
Charlie, with all that guilt
stuff, I did, I got her.

18:44.899 --> 18:47.499
Well, that's it really.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.001
I've set up everything.

18:49.003 --> 18:53.171
Dylan knows all about it and
can fill you in on everything,

18:53.173 --> 18:57.111
that is if you're granting
a dying man his wish.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.350
I truly love you, Patty.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.953
I always have done.

19:06.954 --> 19:08.790
From your first breath

19:10.824 --> 19:11.759
to my last.

19:16.130 --> 19:19.467
Charlie, how do I
switch this thing off?

19:24.804 --> 19:25.640
Pops.

19:26.474 --> 19:27.309
So?

19:28.942 --> 19:31.045
What do you think, kiddo?

19:32.513 --> 19:36.180
I think I just inherited a
bed and breakfast.

19:42.089 --> 19:42.924
Gammy?

19:48.595 --> 19:49.427
Gammy?

19:49.429 --> 19:50.265
Up here!

20:02.774 --> 20:03.442
Still not big
on cleaning, huh?

20:03.444 --> 20:05.511
Ah, pish posh.

20:05.513 --> 20:09.648
A clean house is a
sign of a boring life.

20:09.650 --> 20:13.619
Well, then this place
is very not boring.

20:13.621 --> 20:14.485
What are you working on?

20:14.487 --> 20:16.522
Well, can't you tell?

20:16.524 --> 20:19.457
It's a sculpture of
you and your new friend.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.793
Am I really that ugly?

20:21.795 --> 20:25.967
If you want to see the beauty,
you have to believe in it.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.637
Well, I believe it
looks like a pretzel.

20:31.639 --> 20:34.606
But it's a very good pretzel.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.074
Oh.

20:36.076 --> 20:37.878
Oh, I have missed you.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.684
Gam, you're getting
clay all over me.

20:45.686 --> 20:47.355
Oh, I am so sorry.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.253
Gam!

20:58.332 --> 21:02.000
Guess you must be pretty
handy with a mop, huh?

21:03.070 --> 21:04.770
Sorry, I'll clean it.

21:04.772 --> 21:06.038
Don't worry about it.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.173
You're gonna have to
save your strength.

21:08.175 --> 21:09.608
For what?

21:09.610 --> 21:11.609
Well, I figure we can
start with the fence,

21:11.611 --> 21:13.044
and then once we're done that,

21:13.046 --> 21:14.780
we're gonna have to repaint
the side of the house.

21:14.782 --> 21:16.013
I think it's gonna stay white,

21:16.015 --> 21:18.783
but like a lighter
shade of white.

21:18.785 --> 21:20.084
Seriously?

21:20.086 --> 21:23.187
Well, it's either
that or the other job.

21:23.189 --> 21:24.923
Well, what's the other job?

21:24.925 --> 21:28.159
Well, somebody's gotta
take care of Tanner.

21:28.161 --> 21:32.030
You know, feed him, brush him,
hang out with him all day.

21:32.032 --> 21:33.131
Really?

21:33.133 --> 21:34.166
Can I, Gam?

21:34.168 --> 21:36.033
He's waiting for you.

21:36.035 --> 21:40.207
Are you sure? I picked out
a really nice shade of white.

21:43.811 --> 21:46.648
And I mopped myself
into a corner.

21:49.283 --> 21:51.082
Morning, Tanner.

21:51.084 --> 21:53.087
Look what I brought you.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.358
That's good, isn't it?

21:59.360 --> 22:03.494
I can't believe I just met you
and I already have to leave.

22:03.496 --> 22:06.831
You know, maybe I can convince
Mom to come back next summer.

22:09.570 --> 22:11.239
What's wrong, buddy?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.543
You wanna go for a run?

22:16.810 --> 22:18.843
Man, Mom would
totally ground me.

22:21.782 --> 22:24.249
It'll be worth it, come on.

22:57.251 --> 23:00.522
I bet Pop took you
out here a lot, huh?

23:02.590 --> 23:03.487
What's wrong, buddy?

23:05.692 --> 23:07.359
I say we just fly
out and say hello.

23:07.361 --> 23:09.061
What's the worst
that could happen?

23:09.063 --> 23:10.294
We can't talk to her.

23:10.296 --> 23:11.463
McKenna said.

23:11.465 --> 23:13.165
McKenna is not the boss of us.

23:13.167 --> 23:14.933
Who knows if she
can even hear us?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.105
Hello, is someone there?

23:18.339 --> 23:19.705
Whoa.

23:19.707 --> 23:23.308
Mind blown.

23:23.310 --> 23:25.042
Look, she's probably lost.

23:25.044 --> 23:26.611
We can't just leave her
out there all alone.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.646
I'm going.

23:27.648 --> 23:30.349
You will do no such thing.

23:30.351 --> 23:32.083
Her timing is awesome.

23:32.085 --> 23:33.619
Why are you always trying
to be the boss of me?

23:33.621 --> 23:35.454
Keep your voice
down, she can hear us.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.822
If she can hear us, then maybe
we're supposed to meet her.

23:37.824 --> 23:40.827
We have no reason
to go out there.

23:41.928 --> 23:43.427
What is that?

23:48.736 --> 23:49.967
Well, now we have
to go help the horse.

23:49.969 --> 23:52.070
No, no, no, wait.

23:52.072 --> 23:53.908
Is that your umbrella?

23:56.709 --> 23:58.176
Yeah.

23:58.178 --> 23:59.013
Sorry.

24:03.883 --> 24:05.719
Okay, let's go home.

24:10.224 --> 24:12.393
I just wanted to say hi.

24:15.528 --> 24:17.029
What kind
of person does that?

24:17.031 --> 24:18.664
I said she could
take care of Tanner.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.865
Uh-oh.

24:19.867 --> 24:21.132
I thought
she'd have fun.

24:21.134 --> 24:22.634
Well, maybe
you should let me decide

24:22.636 --> 24:24.002
what's fun for my daughter!

24:24.004 --> 24:25.803
No, Mom, it's
not Dylan's fault.

24:25.805 --> 24:27.571
I didn't ask if I could ride.

24:27.573 --> 24:30.309
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that was?

24:30.311 --> 24:31.676
What were you thinking?

24:31.678 --> 24:34.346
I just wanted to ride
him once before we left.

24:34.348 --> 24:37.685
Well, we may not
be leaving after all.

24:38.619 --> 24:39.818
We're staying?

24:39.820 --> 24:41.852
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

24:45.159 --> 24:46.724
For now, Amanda.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.025
I'm going to tell Gam.

24:48.027 --> 24:49.363
Gam, guess what?

24:50.831 --> 24:52.997
I'm still mad at you.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.232
Sorry I couldn't tell you

24:54.234 --> 24:55.167
about the bed and
breakfast thing.

24:55.169 --> 24:56.935
Your dad made me promise.

24:58.471 --> 24:59.638
Yeah, no, that's fine.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.539
You cool off.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.876
I'll chat later.

25:04.644 --> 25:06.211
Gammy, we're staying!

25:06.213 --> 25:07.446
We're staying!

25:07.448 --> 25:08.679
I get to stay here
with you and Tanner!

25:08.681 --> 25:11.116
Oh, petal,
that is wonderful!

25:11.118 --> 25:12.417
Okay, so I'm thinking
that I'm gonna be

25:12.419 --> 25:13.584
in charge of Tanner.

25:13.586 --> 25:14.785
I mean, not in
charge or anything,

25:14.787 --> 25:16.722
but I'm gonna make
sure that he's brushed

25:16.724 --> 25:18.322
and fed and exercised and stuff,

25:18.324 --> 25:21.126
but you have to help me
convince Mom to let me ride him.

25:21.128 --> 25:24.862
Never mind about
the horse, Amanda.

25:24.864 --> 25:27.465
Ugh, that's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

25:27.467 --> 25:29.967
We need to figure out how to
run this bed and breakfast.

25:29.969 --> 25:32.870
Come on, Mom, he's
not exercised...

25:32.872 --> 25:34.638
Wait, what bed and breakfast?

25:34.640 --> 25:35.940
It's a long story,

25:35.942 --> 25:38.976
apparently part of Pop's
master plan.

25:38.978 --> 25:41.580
He's taken his home and made
it into a bed and breakfast

25:41.582 --> 25:42.848
for us to run.

25:42.850 --> 25:44.116
So did you quit?

25:44.118 --> 25:45.852
No, I took a leave.

25:46.853 --> 25:48.352
They're not thrilled,

25:48.354 --> 25:52.256
but losing Dad seemed to
have given me some leeway.

25:52.258 --> 25:53.724
It's not permanent,

25:53.726 --> 25:55.359
but we'll help Gam get
this place up and running,

25:55.361 --> 25:57.061
and then we have to go back.

25:57.063 --> 25:58.429
Gam, are you hearing this?

25:58.431 --> 26:00.064
Oh, yes, I'm so glad

26:00.066 --> 26:01.800
that you and Tanner
are getting along.

26:01.802 --> 26:04.168
Apparently this is gonna
take longer than I thought.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.971
She'll be all right.

26:05.973 --> 26:08.039
Your Pops really did
set it up for you guys.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.442
Is this really the best
time for you to just jump in?

26:10.444 --> 26:13.878
I'm not really sure you've
shown you have a best time.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.112
What does that mean?

26:15.114 --> 26:17.014
I think you
know what it means.

26:17.016 --> 26:17.916
Look, I'm just trying to help.

26:17.918 --> 26:19.184
I don't understand...

26:19.186 --> 26:20.685
What are
you looking at, Gam?

26:20.687 --> 26:23.455
Looks like my fairy friends
are throwing another party.

26:23.457 --> 26:24.523
She's my daughter.

26:24.525 --> 26:25.791
- Fairies.
- I make the decision.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.091
- Oh my, yes.
- You're not listening.

26:27.093 --> 26:29.764
Can't us
see them there?

26:31.965 --> 26:32.930
Mom, come look!

26:32.932 --> 26:34.465
The forest has fairies in it.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.201
You know, I knew I heard
voices when I was in there.

26:37.737 --> 26:40.272
Mom, please don't fill
her head with nonsense.

26:40.274 --> 26:42.040
Just because you
choose not to see them

26:42.042 --> 26:44.544
doesn't mean they aren't real.

26:45.646 --> 26:46.977
Dylan, have you seen them?

26:46.979 --> 26:48.713
Oh no, I don't
go in that forest.

26:48.715 --> 26:50.215
It's haunted.

26:50.217 --> 26:51.483
That's the smartest
thing you've said

26:51.485 --> 26:52.951
since you've been here.

26:52.953 --> 26:54.753
Amanda, you stay
out of there too.

26:54.755 --> 26:55.753
What?

26:55.755 --> 26:56.754
- No way.
- You wanna hear smart?

26:56.756 --> 26:57.988
I'll tell you smart.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.925
How about you learn to
raise your daughter?

26:59.927 --> 27:01.392
Your daughter knows

27:01.394 --> 27:02.828
- how to ride a horse.
- Uh, hellO, excuse me.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.029
I've seen her,
I've seen her ride the horse.

27:04.031 --> 27:05.429
Of course she
can ride the horse,

27:05.431 --> 27:06.231
- she's had lessons.
- So what's the big deal?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.365
She can ride the horse.

27:07.367 --> 27:08.166
- Just give her a chance.
- Uh, excuse me?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.067
Easy?

27:09.069 --> 27:10.234
It's not that easy.

27:10.236 --> 27:10.901
Stop yelling
at me, I don't...

27:13.172 --> 27:14.638
Hi there.

27:14.640 --> 27:18.109
Uh, I'm sorry to disturb
you, but are you guys open?

27:18.111 --> 27:21.847
Oh, yeah, your dad did
have me distribute those.

27:23.516 --> 27:26.952
Sorry, we're really
in the beginning stages.

27:26.954 --> 27:29.487
But I can take your name and
number and I can call you back.

27:29.489 --> 27:30.421
- I just...
- Yeah, that's fine.

27:30.423 --> 27:32.859
I just need a...

27:35.996 --> 27:36.962
Your name, sir?

27:36.964 --> 27:38.429
Uh, Turk.

27:38.431 --> 27:39.933
Uh, Turk Peterson.

27:44.403 --> 27:46.504
Little Turkey Pete?

27:46.506 --> 27:47.539
Hey, Patricia.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.807
Oh my gosh.

27:48.809 --> 27:51.176
I haven't seen you
in like 20 years.

27:51.178 --> 27:52.644
Yeah, 20 years
sounds about right.

27:52.646 --> 27:54.612
And wow, like, you look great.

27:54.614 --> 27:55.647
Thank you.

27:55.649 --> 27:57.249
You too, you look great.

27:57.251 --> 27:58.516
I see you got your braces off.

27:58.518 --> 27:59.751
Yeah, well, I wanted
to keep them on,

27:59.753 --> 28:01.552
but the dentist said
20 years was overkill,

28:01.554 --> 28:04.255
so what can you do?

28:04.257 --> 28:06.090
Well, your teeth look great.

28:06.092 --> 28:07.492
I mean, not just your teeth.

28:07.494 --> 28:09.063
You all look great.

28:10.596 --> 28:11.862
What are you doing here?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.665
Doesn't your parents
live down the road?

28:13.667 --> 28:15.766
Yeah,
I guess they are

28:15.768 --> 28:16.734
just down there, aren't they?

28:16.736 --> 28:17.572
Uh...

28:19.505 --> 28:23.073
You know what,
I'm just gonna come clean.

28:23.075 --> 28:25.810
I heard you were in the area
and I wanted to come see you.

28:25.812 --> 28:27.078
Oh.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.348
So, um, how was
it riding Tanner?

28:30.350 --> 28:32.817
Isn't it fun doing something
you're not supposed to?

28:32.819 --> 28:34.252
Yeah.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.753
I thought you'd be
alone, and I'm came here,

28:35.755 --> 28:37.821
and everybody was here
and I got all nervous,

28:37.823 --> 28:41.126
and I panicked, and now
I'm really embarrassed.

28:41.128 --> 28:43.661
You know what, I'm just
gonna go, actually, um...

28:43.663 --> 28:45.397
It's fine.

28:45.399 --> 28:46.932
Oh, I'll take fine.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.532
Fine's better than crazy, right?

28:48.534 --> 28:49.667
Yeah.

28:49.669 --> 28:51.505
So, um, would you...

28:53.306 --> 28:55.240
Uh, uh, would...

28:55.242 --> 28:56.474
Oh, right.

28:56.476 --> 28:58.979
Yeah, no, I, I got
stuff I can do.

29:00.581 --> 29:02.246
Sorry, what were you saying?

29:02.248 --> 29:06.318
He's about to ask you
out to lunch.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.619
- Mom!
- No, no, she's right.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.822
She's abrupt, but, uh, right.

29:11.824 --> 29:12.991
So what do you say?

29:12.993 --> 29:15.593
Would you like to go for lunch?

29:15.595 --> 29:17.161
Sure.

29:17.163 --> 29:18.396
That sounds great.

29:18.398 --> 29:20.197
Oh, great, oh, thank
you for saying yes.

29:20.199 --> 29:22.199
Uh, would one work?

29:22.201 --> 29:23.734
- Sure.
- Great.

29:23.736 --> 29:27.105
Uh, wow, I just realized we
keep saying great a lot, um,

29:27.107 --> 29:28.340
- okay, I'll see you at one.
- Leave.

29:28.342 --> 29:30.308
Maybe,
yeah, yeah, okay.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.509
I'll just go.

29:31.511 --> 29:32.346
Bye.

29:33.880 --> 29:34.715
Hmm.

30:16.122 --> 30:18.455
Hey, Turk,
I'll be right there.

30:18.457 --> 30:19.491
Uh, sure thing.

30:19.493 --> 30:21.062
Uh, take your time.

30:35.641 --> 30:36.808
Hey.

30:36.810 --> 30:39.109
I'm taking her out right now.

30:39.111 --> 30:41.378
No, no, I don't think
she'll be any trouble.

30:41.380 --> 30:43.447
Um, if you leave it with me,

30:43.449 --> 30:46.150
I promise we'll start this demo.

30:46.152 --> 30:50.323
Okay, hello, hello?

30:51.323 --> 30:53.159
Oh, um, Ashley, right?

30:54.861 --> 30:55.793
Amanda.

30:55.795 --> 30:57.028
Ah, right, right, Amanda.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.429
Um, I don't know if you heard.

30:58.431 --> 31:01.532
I was just, uh, having a
conversation with, uh, my buddy.

31:01.534 --> 31:03.400
So what are you
planning on demoing?

31:03.402 --> 31:06.236
My
buddy is in a band,

31:06.238 --> 31:08.973
and, uh, I'm producing the demo.

31:08.975 --> 31:12.609
Right, and why would
my mom be any trouble?

31:12.611 --> 31:14.111
You know what, Amanda,

31:14.113 --> 31:16.447
what if we keep this demo
talk between you and me,

31:16.449 --> 31:18.082
and I give you some money,

31:18.084 --> 31:20.017
maybe for a new
saddle for your horse?

31:20.019 --> 31:21.218
Your horse could use
a new saddle, I see.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.486
Mom, Mom!

31:22.488 --> 31:24.589
Oh, no, you don't need Mom.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.590
No, no, you stay
right here, all right.

31:26.592 --> 31:29.029
Hey, hey, come back, come on!

31:38.505 --> 31:40.003
Did I hear Amanda?

31:40.005 --> 31:42.107
Yeah, she said something
about going on a walk,

31:42.109 --> 31:43.574
but not to worry about her

31:43.576 --> 31:45.744
and to buy you something
nice for lunch.

31:45.746 --> 31:46.910
She's a handful, that one.

31:46.912 --> 31:48.582
Oh, I can imagine.

31:50.316 --> 31:51.818
I'll get the door.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.125
Thanks.

32:19.746 --> 32:21.549
Hey, kid, you alive?

32:23.917 --> 32:25.582
Yeah, I think so.

32:25.584 --> 32:27.619
Man, you really
cracked into that branch.

32:27.621 --> 32:29.320
I tried to warn you.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.789
I thought you were a ghost.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.389
Ghost?

32:32.391 --> 32:33.925
How crazy would that be?

32:41.400 --> 32:42.900
You're a fairy.

32:42.902 --> 32:45.936
I bet it was the wings
that tipped you off, huh?

32:45.938 --> 32:48.173
Are you gonna hurt me?

32:48.175 --> 32:49.439
Are you serious?

32:49.441 --> 32:51.208
You're like 1,000
feet taller than me.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.543
Plus you have this giant horse.

32:55.982 --> 32:57.682
This is Tanner.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.117
Hi, Tanner, I'm Cali.

33:00.786 --> 33:01.886
What's that?

33:01.888 --> 33:03.021
Is that right?

33:03.023 --> 33:04.088
Did she really say that?

33:04.090 --> 33:05.423
She's here to do what?

33:05.425 --> 33:07.891
What? What is he saying?

33:07.893 --> 33:10.061
I have no idea.

33:10.063 --> 33:11.462
I can't talk to horses.

33:11.464 --> 33:12.996
Come on, let's get
you all cleaned up.

33:46.867 --> 33:47.999
I must be dreaming.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.336
Nope, no dream.

33:51.338 --> 33:54.809
Come on, my house is
just right over here.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.776
Nothing to see here, folks,

33:59.778 --> 34:02.849
just a giant girl
with a cracked noggin.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.822
Cali, what do you
think you're doing?

34:11.824 --> 34:14.458
Relax, McKenna, I'm
just giving this girl...

34:14.460 --> 34:15.559
Amanda.

34:15.561 --> 34:17.262
Amanda here
something for her head.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.264
You can't just be
bringing aways here.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.297
Aways?

34:21.300 --> 34:23.033
Like away from here.

34:23.034 --> 34:25.135
It's what some of the
ruder fairies call you.

34:25.137 --> 34:26.406
Gimme a second.

34:29.141 --> 34:31.775
You know what Aleeda said.

34:31.777 --> 34:32.909
What do you want me to do,

34:32.911 --> 34:34.610
leave her unconscious
in the forest?

34:34.612 --> 34:36.513
I'll clean her up and
send her on her way.

34:36.514 --> 34:38.283
I'm telling Aleeda.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.617
Nothing personal.

34:40.853 --> 34:43.152
So how long have
you guys been here?

34:43.155 --> 34:44.090
Not sure.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.858
As far back as I can
remember, anyway.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.495
Aleeda and some others
came over on a boat.

34:50.496 --> 34:53.231
Others just sort of
got here, you know?

34:53.233 --> 34:55.902
Bang-o.

34:59.738 --> 35:01.842
Slap this on your noggin.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.611
Ow.

35:06.613 --> 35:08.479
Yeah, it's got a sting to it.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.013
But you'll feel
better in the morning.

35:10.015 --> 35:11.615
Cali, Cali!

35:11.617 --> 35:13.084
Cali, did you hear?

35:13.086 --> 35:15.919
One of the fairies brought
an away to the village!

35:15.921 --> 35:16.720
Hello.

35:16.722 --> 35:17.588
Hello.

35:17.590 --> 35:19.193
Oh man, the away.

35:21.427 --> 35:24.428
Amanda, this is
Harper and Emilyn.

35:24.430 --> 35:26.097
One of them is smarter
than the other.

35:26.099 --> 35:28.365
Oh, thanks, Cali.

35:28.367 --> 35:29.901
Nice to meet you.

35:29.903 --> 35:31.269
Nice to meet you too.

35:31.271 --> 35:32.803
I like the flowers in your hair.

35:32.805 --> 35:35.238
Thanks, we call them
friendship flowers.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.941
We make them for each other.

35:36.943 --> 35:37.874
You want one?

35:37.876 --> 35:38.876
We'd have to be friends first,

35:38.878 --> 35:40.778
but then we could make you one.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.180
Sure.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.914
This place is incredible.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.749
Yeah, we like it.

35:45.751 --> 35:47.751
That's our place over there.

35:47.753 --> 35:51.155
Since we're best friends
now, you can come over.

35:51.157 --> 35:55.492
You may need to stay
outside, though.

35:55.494 --> 35:56.660
Cool.

35:56.662 --> 35:58.129
The one beside is McKenna's.

35:58.131 --> 36:00.932
Don't knock on her door unless
you like being yelled at.

36:00.934 --> 36:03.604
Which would be weird if you did.

36:04.671 --> 36:05.970
Whose house is that?

36:05.972 --> 36:08.205
That house isn't ready yet.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.640
What do you mean?

36:09.642 --> 36:12.744
A fairy door won't open until
the fairy inside is ready.

36:12.746 --> 36:15.178
That fairy's not ready.

36:15.180 --> 36:16.814
There, see?

36:16.816 --> 36:18.216
Quick, hide in our house.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.584
Uh.

36:19.586 --> 36:21.488
Let me move some stuff.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.321
Told you she brought one.

36:24.323 --> 36:27.858
Yes, McKenna,
hard not to see her.

36:27.860 --> 36:30.028
Cali, explain yourself.

36:30.030 --> 36:32.562
Before you get too
upset, I know the rules.

36:32.564 --> 36:33.997
But Amanda was riding
through the forest

36:33.999 --> 36:35.533
and smacked her noggin.

36:35.535 --> 36:37.234
I couldn't just let
her die, could I?

36:37.236 --> 36:38.635
You risked all of us, Cali.

36:38.637 --> 36:40.771
Oh, please, why are
we so afraid of them?

36:40.773 --> 36:43.209
Girls, that's quite enough.

36:44.644 --> 36:46.209
How's your head, little girl?

36:46.211 --> 36:48.715
Much better, thanks to Cali.

36:50.617 --> 36:54.718
You remind me of someone
I knew a long time ago.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.887
Thanks, I guess.

36:56.889 --> 36:59.090
Tell me, what brought
you through our forest

36:59.092 --> 37:01.191
at such great speeds?

37:01.193 --> 37:02.693
I almost forgot.

37:02.695 --> 37:04.562
There was this guy, Turk,
and he's dating my mom,

37:04.564 --> 37:07.097
and I heard him on the
phone talking about demos,

37:07.099 --> 37:08.698
and then he grabbed me.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.033
He grabbed you?

37:10.035 --> 37:13.137
Well, he tried,
but I ran away.

37:13.139 --> 37:15.872
What they do is
no business of ours.

37:15.874 --> 37:19.609
As much as I see this
pains you, McKenna's right.

37:19.611 --> 37:21.079
We don't interfere
with what goes on

37:21.081 --> 37:22.780
outside the forest walls.

37:22.782 --> 37:26.149
Aleeda, Amanda
might be in danger.

37:26.151 --> 37:28.486
My decision is final.

37:28.488 --> 37:31.655
I have my reasons
for staying out.

37:31.657 --> 37:34.591
I must also forbid any
further contact with Amanda.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.497
Amanda?

37:40.499 --> 37:41.834
That's my mom.

38:00.619 --> 38:02.253
There you are.

38:02.255 --> 38:03.187
We've been worried.

38:03.189 --> 38:04.488
We've been searching for you.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.622
Don't freak out.

38:05.624 --> 38:07.158
What
happened to your head?

38:07.160 --> 38:08.258
We gotta take you
to the hospital.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.029
No, Mom, it's fine.

38:12.131 --> 38:13.597
She helped me.

38:16.068 --> 38:17.468
Who helped you?

38:17.470 --> 38:18.972
Cali, the fairy.

38:19.872 --> 38:20.706
What?

38:22.242 --> 38:23.707
What's wrong?

38:23.709 --> 38:25.309
She can't see us.

38:25.311 --> 38:26.144
What?

38:26.146 --> 38:27.778
She's in between.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.713
Not young enough
to believe in us.

38:29.715 --> 38:32.916
Not old enough
to believe again.

38:32.918 --> 38:35.855
Sweetie, you're
talking nonsense.

38:36.756 --> 38:38.021
- Wait.
- Come on.

38:38.023 --> 38:38.955
I have to
tell you about Turk.

38:38.957 --> 38:40.191
There she is.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.858
Amanda, are you okay?

38:41.860 --> 38:43.227
We were worried about you.

38:43.229 --> 38:44.995
I heard him on the phone.

38:44.997 --> 38:46.263
He's up to something.

38:46.265 --> 38:47.101
What?

38:48.334 --> 38:50.233
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

38:50.235 --> 38:52.202
I don't like this guy one bit.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.805
He tried to pay me
to keep it a secret.

38:54.807 --> 38:56.374
What is going on?

38:56.376 --> 38:58.242
Okay, you got me.

38:59.512 --> 39:01.144
I saw Amanda on the
horse the other day,

39:01.146 --> 39:02.747
and she asked me to
keep it a secret.

39:02.749 --> 39:04.182
I'm sorry, Amanda,
I gotta come clean.

39:04.184 --> 39:05.416
Are you kidding me?

39:05.418 --> 39:06.950
I feel bad.

39:06.952 --> 39:10.354
I see what happened now, and
I just, this is my fault.

39:10.356 --> 39:12.289
He was on the phone
talking about demolition.

39:12.291 --> 39:13.256
Demolition?

39:13.258 --> 39:14.658
You believe me, don't you?

39:16.528 --> 39:19.162
Sweetie, you were just
talking about seeing a fairy.

39:19.164 --> 39:20.263
Mom.

39:21.601 --> 39:23.533
You're unbelievable.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.202
Amanda!

39:27.072 --> 39:28.638
Easy, boy.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.274
Just let her blow
off some steam, okay?

39:31.276 --> 39:34.010
I'm gonna take Tanner
back to the stables.

39:34.012 --> 39:35.512
Thanks, Dylan.

39:35.514 --> 39:36.780
Listen, I'm sorry.

39:36.782 --> 39:38.216
No, it's my fault.

39:38.218 --> 39:40.850
She's under a lot of stress
lately, she's acting up.

39:40.852 --> 39:43.954
No, no, you don't need any
more responsibility, all right?

39:43.956 --> 39:46.459
You have enough on your plate.

39:48.293 --> 39:49.926
You're a good guy.

39:49.928 --> 39:50.760
Aw.

39:50.762 --> 39:51.762
Come on.

39:51.764 --> 39:52.932
I really am.

39:59.905 --> 40:00.740
Ow.

40:08.146 --> 40:10.381
I just, I
don't know what to do.

40:10.383 --> 40:12.316
I just thought I was doing the
right thing by staying here,

40:12.318 --> 40:14.684
but this is all out of control.

40:14.686 --> 40:16.153
She'll sleep it off.

40:16.155 --> 40:18.122
And all this
nonsense with fairies?

40:18.124 --> 40:20.490
I swear, my mom's
filling her head.

40:20.492 --> 40:24.495
Ugh, I haven't even started
getting this place ready.

40:24.497 --> 40:25.729
What am I doing?

40:25.731 --> 40:27.131
Tell you what.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.399
I'll come by in the morning
and give you a hand.

40:28.401 --> 40:30.166
Oh, no, I
couldn't ask you to...

40:30.168 --> 40:31.869
No, it's
already settled.

40:31.871 --> 40:33.903
You're a lifesaver.

40:33.905 --> 40:36.941
Hey, do you wanna
go get some coffee?

40:36.943 --> 40:39.276
Coffee sounds great.

40:48.688 --> 40:49.519
Amanda!

40:53.126 --> 40:53.957
What are you guys doing here?

40:56.028 --> 40:58.095
That's exactly
what I keep asking.

40:58.097 --> 40:59.396
Relax.

40:59.398 --> 41:01.564
We just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

41:01.566 --> 41:03.401
I guess I'm all right.

41:03.403 --> 41:04.669
We talked it over,

41:04.671 --> 41:06.604
and we decided we're
going to help you.

41:06.606 --> 41:07.437
Really?

41:07.439 --> 41:08.773
All of you?

41:08.775 --> 41:12.175
Well, no, not all of
us, but the four of us.

41:12.177 --> 41:13.510
That's better than
nothing, right?

41:13.512 --> 41:15.680
For the record,
I'm not here to help.

41:15.682 --> 41:16.981
I'm here to keep a
logistical record

41:16.983 --> 41:19.450
of the events that transpire.

41:19.452 --> 41:22.253
I don't know what that
means, but we wanna help.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.624
Thank you so much,
guys, but what can we do?

41:26.626 --> 41:28.626
My mom thinks I'm
just imagining you.

41:28.628 --> 41:29.894
Let's keep it that way.

41:29.896 --> 41:30.961
Meet us at the pond.

41:30.963 --> 41:32.762
That'll be our meeting place.

41:32.764 --> 41:36.566
Oh, I've always wanted
a secret meeting place!

41:36.568 --> 41:38.269
Emilyn, how long
have I been saying

41:38.271 --> 41:39.836
we should have a
secret meeting place?

41:39.838 --> 41:41.037
A long time.

41:41.039 --> 41:41.939
High five!

41:42.775 --> 41:44.008
Wing high five!

41:48.680 --> 41:50.613
Okay, see you tomorrow.

41:50.615 --> 41:52.450
See you tomorrow.

41:53.418 --> 41:55.554
Oh, here, I almost forgot.

41:58.157 --> 41:59.622
You made this for me?

41:59.624 --> 42:03.496
Of course, you're our
friend, aren't ya?

42:05.631 --> 42:08.735
For the record,
we are not friends.

42:22.682 --> 42:23.513
More coffee, sir?

42:23.515 --> 42:25.015
Oh, you startled me.

42:25.017 --> 42:26.816
Uh, yes, please.

42:26.818 --> 42:28.352
Sorry, just making my rounds.

42:31.990 --> 42:32.957
Good morning, Mr. Peterson.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.994
Ah, everybody's sneaking
up on me this morning.

42:36.996 --> 42:38.662
Is it the shoes?
You're like a ninja.

42:38.664 --> 42:40.030
I should get a pair like those.

42:40.032 --> 42:41.599
Where'd you get 'em at?

42:41.601 --> 42:44.934
Where is our
money, Mr. Peterson?

42:44.936 --> 42:47.171
Well, you're gonna
like this, 'cause I got...

42:47.173 --> 42:48.608
Finish chewing.

42:52.912 --> 42:54.577
Sorry.

42:54.579 --> 42:56.414
Uh, good news is it's coming.

42:56.416 --> 42:58.615
I know I had a bit of a
rough patch with the dad,

42:58.617 --> 43:01.452
but now I'm kind of,
uh, wooing the daughter,

43:01.454 --> 43:03.220
and I think it's safe
to say without a doubt

43:03.222 --> 43:05.222
that she's probably gonna
sell the farm to me.

43:05.224 --> 43:06.590
So that's good for you,

43:06.592 --> 43:10.461
because then you
get your money back.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.229
Nothing, huh? You're
just like a rock.

43:12.231 --> 43:13.463
You're a hard read.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.932
I don't know what's
going on in that head.

43:14.934 --> 43:16.169
Mr. Peterson,

43:17.637 --> 43:21.274
you and I are involved in
an A, B, and C situation.

43:22.474 --> 43:26.313
A is the borrowing of
my money, which you did.

43:29.648 --> 43:33.819
B is the spending of my
money, which you also did.

43:36.289 --> 43:39.359
And C is the paying
back of my money,

43:40.492 --> 43:42.425
which you have not.

43:42.427 --> 43:45.296
Which part of those letters
involves me listening

43:45.298 --> 43:47.698
to you going on dates?

43:47.700 --> 43:51.734
Well, I see what you're
interested in.

43:51.736 --> 43:54.905
Uh, 'cause I meant like
C, like the letter,

43:54.907 --> 43:57.307
'cause of what,
uh, are you hungry?

43:57.309 --> 43:58.843
They make a mean omelet here.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.644
It's, I don't know what's
in it for the life of me,

44:00.646 --> 44:02.713
but the chickens are
like made out of gold.

44:02.715 --> 44:04.080
Oh, take it, no, take
it easy, take it...

44:07.619 --> 44:11.055
When you first came
to us with this solution

44:11.057 --> 44:15.124
to your money problems,
you said it was,

44:15.126 --> 44:17.061
how did you put it?

44:17.063 --> 44:18.062
In the bag.

44:18.064 --> 44:19.162
But I thought it was, I...

44:19.164 --> 44:20.099
Be quiet.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.867
It's terrible manners to speak

44:22.869 --> 44:24.934
when someone else is speaking.

44:24.936 --> 44:26.437
Sometimes just
things don't always go

44:26.439 --> 44:27.370
according to plan, you know...

44:27.372 --> 44:29.006
Mornin', darlin'.

44:29.008 --> 44:31.341
There's the smile
I came in here for.

44:31.343 --> 44:33.343
Flattery won't
get you free coffee, Charlie.

44:33.345 --> 44:35.945
Well, I can
give you a song and dance too

44:35.947 --> 44:37.515
if you like.

44:37.517 --> 44:38.782
Mornin', Turk.

44:38.784 --> 44:42.285
Morning, Sheriff.

44:53.064 --> 44:54.664
Turk, don't you
want your breakfast?

44:54.666 --> 44:57.536
No, I'm
not really hungry.

45:01.740 --> 45:03.207
Is that
one button or two

45:03.209 --> 45:04.941
that you stole from the village?

45:04.943 --> 45:07.077
Why do you automatically
assume I stole them?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.546
Maybe I found these.

45:08.548 --> 45:09.747
How many?

45:10.650 --> 45:11.849
One.

45:11.851 --> 45:13.753
Looks like two to me.

45:14.686 --> 45:15.686
One.

45:17.055 --> 45:18.555
You tried to kill me.

45:18.557 --> 45:20.524
Under the Order of
Fairy, section three,

45:20.526 --> 45:21.992
any act of violence

45:21.994 --> 45:24.428
against another fairy
shall be considered, whoa!

45:24.430 --> 45:25.662
Now it's none.

45:25.664 --> 45:28.101
And stop accusing
me of stealing.

45:30.235 --> 45:35.171
So she had two in the
sack, but then she threw one.

45:35.173 --> 45:37.943
And then she
threw another one.

45:39.211 --> 45:41.544
Math is hard.

45:41.546 --> 45:43.347
Hi, how's it going?

45:43.349 --> 45:44.981
You're wearing the flower.

45:44.983 --> 45:46.584
Yeah, I made one for Tanner.

45:46.586 --> 45:49.119
I know I'm not a fairy or
anything, so I hope it's okay.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.454
Of course it is.

45:50.456 --> 45:51.955
Wow, good job.

45:51.957 --> 45:54.091
Maybe you are a fairy and
you just don't know it.

45:54.093 --> 45:58.198
Whoa, mind
blown.

45:59.664 --> 46:01.698
All right, I have
it all figured out.

46:01.700 --> 46:04.233
We know he's up to
something, right?

46:04.235 --> 46:05.468
Right.

46:05.470 --> 46:06.903
But since we don't
know what that is,

46:06.905 --> 46:08.571
we just need to
make him go away.

46:08.573 --> 46:10.506
Okay, how do we do that?

46:10.508 --> 46:14.378
I stole a bunch of stuff
from Aleeda to help us.

46:15.648 --> 46:18.584
Come on, we have a
lot of work to do.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.117
Thanks for coming.

46:21.119 --> 46:22.553
There's a lot to do around here.

46:22.555 --> 46:24.088
Oh, I'm happy to lend a hand.

46:24.090 --> 46:25.990
How can I help you?

46:25.992 --> 46:30.327
Well, you can take
this into the stable.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.394
Thanks.

46:31.396 --> 46:32.762
You're a lifesaver.

46:37.403 --> 46:38.836
I really hope this works.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.104
Of course it's going to work.

46:40.106 --> 46:41.675
Sit back and watch.

46:51.483 --> 46:53.719
Whoa, you're a big fella.

47:00.159 --> 47:02.725
Well, you must be
friends with Amanda.

47:02.727 --> 47:05.796
You picked the
losing side, horse.

47:06.631 --> 47:08.233
Whoa, what is that?

47:13.005 --> 47:14.006
Aw, come on.

47:25.950 --> 47:28.651
Oh, you think that's funny, huh?

47:28.653 --> 47:29.919
We'll see if you're laughing

47:29.921 --> 47:31.387
when I send you to
the glue factory.

47:33.659 --> 47:36.026
Okay, I made a bunny ear.

47:36.028 --> 47:38.162
Oh, I
made a rabbit ear.

47:38.164 --> 47:39.566
This should work.

47:55.146 --> 47:57.814
Your chair might be a
little bit more comfortable.

47:57.816 --> 47:59.283
Yeah, I fell.

47:59.285 --> 48:00.517
You all right?

48:00.519 --> 48:03.423
No, something tied
my shoes together.

48:04.756 --> 48:06.256
Don't look at me
like that, all right.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.591
I don't know what it was,
but something tied my shoes.

48:08.593 --> 48:10.359
Nobody ever listens to me.

48:10.361 --> 48:11.729
Listens to you about what?

48:11.731 --> 48:14.097
I keep telling people
this forest is haunted.

48:15.767 --> 48:17.300
What, like ghosts?

48:17.302 --> 48:18.702
Yeah, I've seen 'em.

48:18.704 --> 48:21.338
Bouncing lights,
floating spirits.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.405
Well, that, that's crazy.

48:22.407 --> 48:24.910
That's not, that can't happen.

48:28.546 --> 48:29.680
Yeah, that's my cue.

48:29.682 --> 48:30.513
What was that?

48:30.515 --> 48:31.450
Gonna go.

48:34.153 --> 48:36.120
Where, where are you
going, you leaving?

48:36.122 --> 48:39.359
Whoa!

48:49.101 --> 48:49.932
Yes!

48:49.934 --> 48:50.934
Ow.

48:52.204 --> 48:54.972
And that's how you
get rid of someone.

48:56.742 --> 48:57.608
Whoa.

48:57.610 --> 48:58.709
Turk.

48:58.711 --> 48:59.542
What is it?

48:59.544 --> 49:00.646
What's wrong?

49:01.981 --> 49:05.716
You got
ghosts going on over there.

49:06.785 --> 49:07.617
Ghosts?

49:07.619 --> 49:08.551
Yeah, yeah.

49:08.553 --> 49:09.720
They came right after me.

49:09.722 --> 49:11.187
All right, come over here.

49:11.189 --> 49:13.923
We gotta get you cleaned up.

49:13.925 --> 49:14.760
Come on.

49:18.831 --> 49:21.365
You know, I hate to think it,

49:21.367 --> 49:24.734
but that ghost is
probably Amanda.

49:24.736 --> 49:27.604
She has a unique way
of handling things.

49:27.606 --> 49:30.740
Yeah, well, I don't think
she likes me very much.

49:30.742 --> 49:31.941
Give her time.

49:31.943 --> 49:34.680
Her and my dad
were really close.

49:36.081 --> 49:39.283
Yeah, I suppose it's hard
when you lose someone you love.

49:39.285 --> 49:40.517
Yeah.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.586
He meant a lot to her

49:42.588 --> 49:45.421
Well, I was meaning you.

49:47.726 --> 49:48.561
Mm.

50:25.064 --> 50:28.432
It's been three
weeks and Turk is still here.

50:32.637 --> 50:33.637
You have to
lay your hand flat

50:33.639 --> 50:35.905
or the rock won't skip.

50:35.907 --> 50:37.506
My hand is flat.

50:37.508 --> 50:39.675
Maybe it's too flat.

50:42.180 --> 50:45.448
No, like this, watch.

50:47.452 --> 50:49.653
Hello, are you guys
even listening to me?

50:49.655 --> 50:52.856
Sorry, we're trying
to get the hang of this.

50:52.858 --> 50:54.457
Ooh!

50:56.361 --> 50:57.827
Do you mind?

50:57.829 --> 50:59.363
Why would I mind?

50:59.365 --> 51:01.497
Yeah, you got wet,
you should mind.

51:03.135 --> 51:05.371
She doesn't know herself.

51:08.240 --> 51:10.073
So what if he's going
out with your Mom?

51:10.075 --> 51:11.742
Maybe that will be better.

51:11.744 --> 51:13.209
I just don't trust him.

51:13.211 --> 51:15.379
We have to figure out
how to get rid of him.

51:15.381 --> 51:16.613
So this is why
you come down here,

51:16.615 --> 51:18.080
so you can talk to yourself?

51:18.082 --> 51:19.850
Hey, Dylan, what
are you doing here?

51:19.852 --> 51:21.050
I was going to the apple tree

51:21.052 --> 51:22.551
to get some apples
for the other animals,

51:22.553 --> 51:24.988
but it looks like somebody
here has cleared us all out.

51:26.791 --> 51:28.325
Sorry, that's my fault.

51:28.327 --> 51:29.526
Oh, yeah, that's your fault

51:29.528 --> 51:31.294
for taking such
good care of Tanner.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.363
Kiddo, you've
been a lifesaver to me.

51:33.365 --> 51:34.231
Really?

51:34.233 --> 51:35.832
Yeah.

51:35.834 --> 51:37.700
Your Pops ever tell
you how he got Tanner?

51:37.702 --> 51:39.369
Oh, I love this story.

51:39.371 --> 51:40.671
No, I didn't
even know about him

51:40.673 --> 51:42.204
until I got here.

51:42.206 --> 51:44.774
Well, your Pops and I
were running an errand

51:44.776 --> 51:46.609
because Jean decided it was time

51:46.611 --> 51:48.278
for her to learn how
to play the piano.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.879
Like most grandmothers do.

51:49.881 --> 51:53.115
So we find one, we get it
all loaded up in my truck,

51:53.117 --> 51:56.986
and we hear this guy,
this real nasty fella,

51:56.988 --> 51:59.425
just yelling and carrying on.

52:00.592 --> 52:02.459
Your Pops being who he
is, goes around back

52:02.461 --> 52:03.660
to see if he can help.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.528
Sounds like Pop.

52:05.530 --> 52:07.830
Turns out this guy
can't control his horse.

52:07.832 --> 52:09.032
Figures the best
way to teach him is

52:09.034 --> 52:11.702
to beat a lesson into him.

52:11.704 --> 52:13.269
I'll be honest, I was
ready to do something

52:13.271 --> 52:14.671
I wouldn't be proud of.

52:14.673 --> 52:17.774
But your Pops,
just cool as a cucumber.

52:17.776 --> 52:19.175
Walks right over to this guy.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.410
Did Pops hit him?

52:20.412 --> 52:23.814
No, he looks him in
the eye and he goes,

52:23.816 --> 52:27.383
"You know the difference
between a guy beating a horse

52:27.385 --> 52:30.586
"and a guy getting
beat up by an old man?"

52:30.588 --> 52:31.823
Guy says, "No."

52:32.925 --> 52:35.325
Pops says,
"Me neither."

52:37.262 --> 52:38.729
The guy was so afraid of Pops,

52:38.731 --> 52:41.597
he just handed over the
reins and walked away.

52:41.599 --> 52:43.332
So we ended up bringing
home the piano for Jean

52:43.334 --> 52:45.769
and Tanner for Pops.

52:45.771 --> 52:49.976
And now I think we brought
home Tanner for you too.

52:51.110 --> 52:53.075
Well, anyways, I better
get into the city

52:53.077 --> 52:54.378
for some apples to eat.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.312
Do you need anything?

52:55.314 --> 52:56.812
No, we're good, thanks, Dylan.

52:56.814 --> 53:01.350
All right, well, I'll
see you back at the farm.

53:01.352 --> 53:04.820
Why can't my
mom date a guy like that?

53:04.822 --> 53:07.189
Okay, we have to
come up with a plan.

53:07.191 --> 53:09.725
Now, I was thinking
we attack his money.

53:09.727 --> 53:10.994
Mess with his car?

53:10.996 --> 53:12.162
He'd have to keep
getting it fixed,

53:12.164 --> 53:13.662
and it will cost a fortune.

53:13.664 --> 53:15.731
Or we could hide one of
every pair of his socks.

53:15.733 --> 53:17.767
- That's always a good one.
- Yeah!

53:17.769 --> 53:19.001
You guys do that?

53:19.003 --> 53:20.970
Oh, yeah, that's
a fairy staple.

53:20.972 --> 53:23.539
Kill two
birds with one stone.

53:23.541 --> 53:24.740
What was that?

53:24.742 --> 53:28.577
I said kill two
birds with one stone.

53:28.579 --> 53:32.649
Are the birds like a
sacrifice or something?

53:32.651 --> 53:33.816
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

53:33.818 --> 53:36.053
- Oh, no.
- I don't wanna do that.

53:36.055 --> 53:38.387
You set
your mom up with Dylan.

53:38.389 --> 53:40.724
She wins because
he's a great guy,

53:40.726 --> 53:43.396
and you win because Turk's gone.

53:44.796 --> 53:45.630
Two birds.

53:46.764 --> 53:47.798
Genius.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.099
Come here!

53:50.702 --> 53:52.705
No, no, no, thank you.

53:53.539 --> 53:54.504
You like us!

53:54.506 --> 53:56.106
Admit that you like us!

53:56.108 --> 53:57.039
I'm not one of you.

53:57.041 --> 53:59.341
I'm just here for note-taking.

53:59.343 --> 54:03.379
Tell us you like us.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.919
Okay, so how do we
make my mom like Dylan?

54:11.622 --> 54:15.461
Makeover!

54:22.501 --> 54:23.767
You brought the
fairy dust, right?

54:23.769 --> 54:25.301
Yeah, I nicked it from Aleeda.

54:25.303 --> 54:27.070
She only keeps it
for emergencies.

54:27.072 --> 54:28.738
Do you want me to tell on you?

54:28.740 --> 54:30.173
'Cause that sounds like
the kind of thing you say

54:30.175 --> 54:32.209
when you want me to tell on you.

54:32.211 --> 54:33.742
She'll never even know.

54:33.744 --> 54:36.213
Okay, I'll go hit him with
a blast and put him out.

54:36.215 --> 54:37.580
So what's in it?

54:37.582 --> 54:38.948
No idea.

54:38.950 --> 54:39.883
You don't know what's in it

54:39.885 --> 54:41.984
and you wanna blast him with it?

54:41.986 --> 54:43.555
How much do we use?

54:46.691 --> 54:48.527
Let's try a handful.

54:54.166 --> 54:56.298
Yay, I
solved a problem!

54:56.300 --> 54:57.934
You so smart!

55:01.939 --> 55:03.907
Okay, first things first.

55:03.909 --> 55:05.608

56:30.361 --> 56:32.695
He's waking up.

56:54.686 --> 56:55.655
We did it!

57:02.693 --> 57:05.829
Oh,
someone cleans up good.

57:05.831 --> 57:07.062
What?

57:07.064 --> 57:10.733
Oh, oh, yeah,
I guess I was sweeping.

57:10.735 --> 57:12.137
No, I mean you.

57:13.438 --> 57:14.273
What?

57:21.512 --> 57:23.348
Yeah, you look good.

57:38.195 --> 57:41.564
Bye, Mom, I'm
going to see Tanner.

57:41.566 --> 57:42.802
Amanda, wait.

57:59.251 --> 58:02.352
Gam, who exactly is this for?

58:02.354 --> 58:04.357
Oh, whoever it'll fit.

58:06.224 --> 58:08.258
Did I ever tell you
when I was asked

58:08.260 --> 58:11.628
to knit a sweater
for the president?

58:11.630 --> 58:12.898
He wanted pink.

58:14.666 --> 58:17.200
Lots of secrets, that man.

58:17.202 --> 58:18.401
All right, you ready?
This is pretty amazing.

58:18.403 --> 58:20.303
- Okay.
- Okay, so...

58:23.275 --> 58:25.108
Yeah.

58:25.110 --> 58:25.975
Uh.

58:27.378 --> 58:28.644
It's not as easy as it looks.

58:28.646 --> 58:30.379
Yes, it
is, children do it.

58:30.381 --> 58:31.513
Well, all right,
it's sounds like

58:31.515 --> 58:32.682
you're accepting the challenge.

58:32.684 --> 58:33.519
Okay.

58:37.456 --> 58:38.754
How did you?

58:38.756 --> 58:42.291
And that's how I
got the pickle out.

58:42.293 --> 58:45.397
Wait, was I telling
the pickle story?

58:48.233 --> 58:50.666
All right.

58:50.668 --> 58:52.401
Well, it looks like
I gotta go practice.

58:52.403 --> 58:55.106
Yeah.

59:00.811 --> 59:04.082
You know, I like
it when you do that.

59:05.015 --> 59:07.216
Do what, the coin trick?

59:07.218 --> 59:08.053
Smile.

59:12.323 --> 59:14.457
Is
that for a giraffe?

59:14.459 --> 59:16.760
What a wonderful idea.

59:16.762 --> 59:18.530
Scarves for giraffes.

59:20.499 --> 59:21.965
So it looks like you and Dylan

59:21.967 --> 59:23.666
have been getting along
pretty good lately.

59:23.668 --> 59:25.100
Yeah.

59:25.102 --> 59:27.236
He's a big help around here.

59:27.238 --> 59:28.204
Is that it?

59:28.206 --> 59:29.372
Just a good employee?

59:29.374 --> 59:30.740
Oh, I see where
you're going with this.

59:30.742 --> 59:33.209
What, where
am I going with it?

59:33.211 --> 59:35.010
Yeah, I'd like to know.

59:35.012 --> 59:36.412
Oh, hey.

59:36.414 --> 59:37.914
What are you doing here?

59:37.916 --> 59:39.883
Well, I was coming to see if
you wanted to watch a movie,

59:39.885 --> 59:41.917
but it looks like your
dance card's already full.

59:41.919 --> 59:43.186
What does that mean?

59:43.188 --> 59:45.287
Well, it means lately
you've been pretty busy.

59:45.289 --> 59:46.588
Well, if you haven't noticed,

59:46.590 --> 59:48.258
we're trying to open a
bed and breakfast, Turk.

59:48.260 --> 59:49.792
I don't know what
you're talking about...

59:49.794 --> 59:51.494
Right,
you have no idea.

59:51.496 --> 59:53.562
It's just all in my head, right?

59:53.564 --> 59:55.097
Maybe it's not.

59:55.099 --> 59:56.298
You know what, Amanda, you
stay out of this, all right?

59:56.300 --> 59:58.136
Okay, that's enough.

59:59.503 --> 01:00:01.271
Everything all
right over here?

01:00:01.273 --> 01:00:02.204
Yeah, we're fine.

01:00:02.206 --> 01:00:03.173
Thanks, Dylan.

01:00:03.175 --> 01:00:04.441
Yeah, thanks, Dylan.

01:00:04.443 --> 01:00:05.642
Thanks for getting in the way.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:06.742
Pardon me?

01:00:06.744 --> 01:00:07.644
Okay, you know what, Turk?

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.245
I think you better go.

01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:10.180
What, are you serious?

01:00:10.182 --> 01:00:12.448
Yes, I am, actually.

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:16.354
I think we could use a
little bit of time here.

01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:18.791
All right.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.061
You all right?

01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:28.564
Yeah, I'm sorry
about all of this.

01:00:28.566 --> 01:00:30.133
Well, you should be.

01:00:30.135 --> 01:00:31.434
I figured out how to
make that coin disappear,

01:00:31.436 --> 01:00:34.070
but I can't make it
come back.

01:00:34.072 --> 01:00:34.907
Whoa.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.807
What?

01:00:37.809 --> 01:00:41.977
That is amazing.

01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:42.782
Mm.

01:00:43.747 --> 01:00:45.013
Show me that again, it's...

01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:47.519
- Okay.
- Okay, so you went over.

01:00:55.293 --> 01:00:57.392
It's not polite to
slam doors, Mr. Peterson.

01:00:57.394 --> 01:00:59.695
Oh, Mr. Green.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:03.733
Uh, wow, you are, you're
really good at sneaking.

01:01:03.735 --> 01:01:05.137
Is it my fault?

01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:07.970
For sneaking?

01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:10.874
Did I not enunciate
the words enough for you

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.542
about getting my money?

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:15.010
Uh, no, no, it's not that.

01:01:15.012 --> 01:01:16.512
You're really good at
speaking, actually.

01:01:16.514 --> 01:01:18.814
Um, I didn't realize we
locked an actual date.

01:01:18.816 --> 01:01:20.249
I thought it was
more like, you know,

01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:23.151
when someone says something
like soon or whenever,

01:01:23.153 --> 01:01:25.088
if it works to get it
back to you as soon...

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:27.122
- Stop talking.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:27.124 --> 01:01:30.059
My associates
and I feel it's time

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:31.727
for us to step in.

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:34.162
No, no, really,
please, I'm really close.

01:01:34.164 --> 01:01:35.097
I can do this if you just...

01:01:35.099 --> 01:01:37.300
Manners, Mr. Peterson.

01:01:37.302 --> 01:01:38.568
I'm really sorry.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.970
If you just, I can get
this deal done tonight.

01:01:40.972 --> 01:01:42.872
Oh, actually, no,
no, I can't get it.

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:45.173
If you give me five more
days I can get it done.

01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:46.845
Just five more days.

01:01:49.613 --> 01:01:50.448
Okay?

01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:03.792
And then my mom
told him to go.

01:02:03.794 --> 01:02:05.327
It really worked!

01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:07.262
McKenna,
you're a genius.

01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:11.800
As far as records go,
I didn't do anything.

01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:15.905
But off the record, I'm
happy for you, Amanda.

01:02:15.907 --> 01:02:16.838
Thank you.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.341
This is so great.

01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:23.046
Turk is gone and now we
can hang out all the time.

01:02:27.385 --> 01:02:28.984
Where is everyone?

01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:29.986
They're gathering supplies.

01:02:29.988 --> 01:02:32.287
They won't be back for hours.

01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:33.525
So, what now?

01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:38.461
Celebrate!

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.162
Whew, yeah!

01:02:47.271 --> 01:02:48.106
Whew!

01:02:49.573 --> 01:02:51.374
What is this?

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:52.211
Aleeda.

01:02:53.445 --> 01:02:56.379
We were, um, just
showing Amanda here...

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.280
Uh, we were celebrating,

01:02:58.282 --> 01:03:00.515
because we helped get
rid of the bad guy.

01:03:00.517 --> 01:03:01.550
What?

01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:02.852
I thought I was quite clear

01:03:02.854 --> 01:03:05.320
when I said that we were
not getting involved.

01:03:05.322 --> 01:03:08.091
They were just trying to help.

01:03:08.093 --> 01:03:09.925
We don't help humans.

01:03:09.927 --> 01:03:12.461
Fairies stay in the forest.

01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:14.497
Aleeda, I can explain.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:18.100
You disappoint me
most of all, McKenna.

01:03:18.102 --> 01:03:19.102
Say goodbye to Amanda.

01:03:19.104 --> 01:03:21.403
You won't be seeing her anymore.

01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:22.372
What?

01:03:22.374 --> 01:03:23.805
What?

01:03:23.807 --> 01:03:25.073
Bye, Amanda.

01:03:25.075 --> 01:03:26.008
Amanda?

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.443
Wait, is that really her name?

01:03:28.445 --> 01:03:30.012
I've been calling her Alanna.

01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:31.180
Why did no one tell me?

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.483
Bye, guys.

01:03:43.327 --> 01:03:44.593
Sorry.

01:03:44.595 --> 01:03:45.496
For what?

01:03:46.664 --> 01:03:47.999
Being my friend?

01:03:49.066 --> 01:03:50.969
I'm not sorry for that.

01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:56.007
So I guess this is it, huh?

01:03:57.809 --> 01:03:58.644
Hold on.

01:04:01.979 --> 01:04:03.314
Here, take this.

01:04:10.655 --> 01:04:11.954
We can use it to talk.

01:04:11.956 --> 01:04:13.122
You light it up from your window

01:04:13.124 --> 01:04:14.590
and I'll make my wings glow

01:04:14.592 --> 01:04:17.026
so we know that we're
thinking about each other.

01:04:17.028 --> 01:04:19.062
Cali.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.530
I better go.

01:04:20.532 --> 01:04:23.466
Hit me up at your window
later so I know you're okay.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:24.303
Okay.

01:04:39.117 --> 01:04:43.019
I thought you were a giant
firefly coming to take me away.

01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:43.956
Hey, Gam.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.823
Everything okay, petal?

01:04:47.825 --> 01:04:49.992
I got my friends in trouble.

01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:53.262
Oh, well, I'm sure
it'll be all right.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.263
In the long run, the friends
who get you into trouble

01:04:55.265 --> 01:04:57.436
are usually the best ones.

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.236
Did Pops get you in trouble?

01:05:00.238 --> 01:05:03.909
Oh, did he ever.

01:05:07.244 --> 01:05:08.313
I miss him.

01:05:18.222 --> 01:05:22.393
You can't really miss
them if they're still here.

01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:26.495
I see your Pop at
the breakfast table,

01:05:26.497 --> 01:05:29.365
singing his off-key songs.

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:32.834
I smell him every time
I open the shirt closet.

01:05:32.836 --> 01:05:35.338
And look, right over there.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.774
Pop made it sure that you and he

01:05:37.776 --> 01:05:40.212
could still go on your rides.

01:05:42.514 --> 01:05:44.015
I love you, Gam.

01:05:45.249 --> 01:05:48.253
From your first
breath to my last.

01:06:21.952 --> 01:06:23.852
Gammy, I made you breakfast.

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:27.622
The toast is kind of burnt,
but at least the eggs are,

01:06:27.624 --> 01:06:30.559
never mind, they're burnt...

01:06:34.865 --> 01:06:35.700
Gammy?

01:07:15.939 --> 01:07:19.610
Can I come in?

01:07:23.481 --> 01:07:25.247
You all right?

01:07:25.249 --> 01:07:26.083
No.

01:07:28.887 --> 01:07:31.354
It's been a couple
of days, Amanda.

01:07:31.356 --> 01:07:35.091
Are you gonna spend the
whole summer up in your room?

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:35.928
Maybe.

01:07:40.965 --> 01:07:43.702
She really loved
you, you know.

01:07:47.037 --> 01:07:48.706
She loved you too.

01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:51.677
I know.

01:07:57.916 --> 01:08:02.084
What do you say we go
down to the kitchen

01:08:02.086 --> 01:08:04.820
and have a nice cup of tea?

01:08:04.822 --> 01:08:08.327
And I'll fill it with
sugar just like Gam.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.095
I guess.

01:08:11.662 --> 01:08:12.496
Good.

01:08:14.765 --> 01:08:15.601
Come on.

01:08:35.719 --> 01:08:37.386
What is this?

01:08:37.388 --> 01:08:38.921
I think you need to sit down.

01:08:38.923 --> 01:08:41.693
Excuse me, I
have things to do.

01:08:43.361 --> 01:08:44.292
Can you sit down?

01:08:44.295 --> 01:08:45.261
I don't wanna sit down.

01:08:45.263 --> 01:08:46.729
What is he doing here?

01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:48.229
Sorry to hear about
your grandma passing away.

01:08:48.232 --> 01:08:49.731
She was a real great woman.

01:08:49.733 --> 01:08:52.600
Yeah, I don't need you to
tell me how great she was.

01:08:52.603 --> 01:08:54.602
Amanda, I think
you need to sit down.

01:08:54.604 --> 01:08:55.636
Stop asking!

01:08:55.639 --> 01:08:57.372
I'm not sitting down.

01:08:57.375 --> 01:09:00.774
It's best to do
it quick, like a Band-Aid.

01:09:00.777 --> 01:09:01.877
What is this?

01:09:01.879 --> 01:09:04.613
You're going home, kiddo.

01:09:04.615 --> 01:09:06.113
Mom, you can't.

01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:09.185
This is a lot
for you to take right now.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.685
It's really for
the best, Amanda.

01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:12.421
Turk, you're not helping.

01:09:12.423 --> 01:09:16.124
Let me guess, you
sold the farm too.

01:09:17.127 --> 01:09:18.796
What? I was kidding!

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:21.895
Mom, what about Tanner?

01:09:21.898 --> 01:09:24.934
I know, but we can get
him a place close to home.

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:26.600
This is home.

01:09:26.603 --> 01:09:27.602
It's all good, Amanda.

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:29.069
Your mom sold me the farm.

01:09:29.072 --> 01:09:30.305
Aren't you happy?

01:09:30.308 --> 01:09:31.305
You get to go back to the city

01:09:31.308 --> 01:09:32.541
and see all your friends again.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.809
I don't have any friends.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.410
All my friends are here.

01:09:35.412 --> 01:09:36.912
How could you sell this place?

01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:39.180
But it was different when
it was the three of us,

01:09:39.183 --> 01:09:40.015
but now...

01:09:40.018 --> 01:09:40.948
Now what?

01:09:40.951 --> 01:09:42.118
Say it.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.283
Amanda.

01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:45.220
Say Gammy's
dead, so it's okay.

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:48.055
Say Pops is dead, so it's okay.

01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:49.057
I don't wanna fight.

01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:51.729
Say you hate me, so it's okay.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.731
Wow.

01:09:56.733 --> 01:09:57.969
Teenagers, huh?

01:10:33.603 --> 01:10:35.941
Doesn't even look like me.

01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:56.460
She knew.

01:11:08.371 --> 01:11:10.705
Day one, the
others said it would be

01:11:10.707 --> 01:11:12.373
too much trouble to
bring the fairies,

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:14.310
and they'd have to stay behind.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.244
But Aleeda said, "Good
friends don't let

01:11:16.246 --> 01:11:18.650
"a little trouble stop them."

01:11:20.084 --> 01:11:24.686
Day 40, we've been at the
farm for a couple of months.

01:11:24.688 --> 01:11:28.190
There's this boy who
keeps bugging me.

01:11:28.192 --> 01:11:30.525
Aleeda said it's
because he likes me.

01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:32.861
I just think he stinks.

01:11:32.863 --> 01:11:33.697
Pops.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.033
Day 100.

01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:41.372
Okay, so, maybe he
doesn't always stink.

01:11:43.006 --> 01:11:45.574
He brought me some
flowers today.

01:11:45.576 --> 01:11:47.642
I think Aleeda helped
him pick them out,

01:11:47.644 --> 01:11:50.445
because yesterday she kept
asking me what kinds I liked,

01:11:50.447 --> 01:11:54.483
and today this kid magically
shows up with the exact ones.

01:11:54.485 --> 01:11:56.521
Either way, it was sweet.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:58.857
Last day.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:04.959
So I guess this book ends with
me marrying the stinky kid.

01:12:04.961 --> 01:12:08.530
Turns out he's the most
amazing man I've ever met.

01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:11.667
Oh, I have never been so happy.

01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:15.236
And I owe it all to
my dear friend Aleeda

01:12:15.238 --> 01:12:18.076
for asking me what
flowers I like.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.077
Funny, I haven't
seen her in awhile.

01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:24.180
Perhaps she moved away.

01:12:24.182 --> 01:12:27.251
I hope she knows
how much I love her.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:30.455
Thank you, Gam.

01:12:36.494 --> 01:12:40.162
Mom, Mom, I have to
show you something!

01:12:40.164 --> 01:12:41.430
Hey, slow down.

01:12:41.432 --> 01:12:42.330
Get out of my way, I
have to show my mom...

01:12:42.332 --> 01:12:43.599
- What's this?
- Stop!

01:12:43.601 --> 01:12:45.266
Relax, I'm
just looking at it.

01:12:45.268 --> 01:12:46.368
I know what you're doing.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.669
Yeah, what's that?

01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:49.637
You used my mom
to get this place.

01:12:49.639 --> 01:12:52.373
And when you said demo,
you meant tear it down.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:53.842
But once I show her this book,

01:12:53.844 --> 01:12:55.110
she's not gonna sell it to you.

01:12:55.112 --> 01:12:56.811
Hmm, you have it
all figured out.

01:12:56.813 --> 01:12:57.980
Did your mom tell you

01:12:57.982 --> 01:13:00.815
that she's already
signed the papers over?

01:13:00.817 --> 01:13:01.950
- Let it go!
- Hey, hey!

01:13:01.952 --> 01:13:02.985
Hey, relax, all right.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:04.153
Just take it easy.

01:13:04.155 --> 01:13:05.654
- You're gonna get...
- What's going on here?

01:13:05.656 --> 01:13:07.855
Amanda was
just showing me her scrapbook.

01:13:07.857 --> 01:13:09.225
She's actually got
some wonderful drawings

01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:10.092
- and pictures in here.
- He's lying!

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.593
This is Gam's book,

01:13:11.595 --> 01:13:13.294
and it proves that there
are fairies in the forest.

01:13:13.296 --> 01:13:14.562
What is going on here?

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.898
Look, I found Gam's book,

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.166
and Turk doesn't
want you to see it

01:13:17.168 --> 01:13:18.934
because there are fairies in it.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:23.338
Look, there are photos of Gam
and Pop when they were little.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.742
I think it's safe to say
Amanda's seeing things.

01:13:26.744 --> 01:13:28.377
Just look.

01:13:28.379 --> 01:13:29.645
Look, right there!

01:13:29.647 --> 01:13:32.146
Enough about the fairies!

01:13:32.148 --> 01:13:34.350
These are just drawings, Amanda.

01:13:34.352 --> 01:13:36.517
They're not real
fairies, just drawings.

01:13:36.519 --> 01:13:38.753
You just have to believe.

01:13:38.755 --> 01:13:40.623
They don't exist!

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:43.124
Look, I'm getting
worried about you.

01:13:43.126 --> 01:13:45.327
You're way too old to
be imagining fairies.

01:13:45.329 --> 01:13:47.229
I am not imagining them.

01:14:01.745 --> 01:14:02.910
What are you doing?

01:14:02.912 --> 01:14:04.145
Get away from my horse!

01:14:04.147 --> 01:14:05.381
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax.

01:14:05.383 --> 01:14:07.115
We're doing our job, okay?

01:14:07.117 --> 01:14:07.949
What is this?

01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:08.917
Turk, what's going on?

01:14:08.919 --> 01:14:10.653
I have no idea.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.887
I'd be happy to
shed some light.

01:14:12.889 --> 01:14:15.423
Uh, Mr. Green, I wasn't
expecting you so soon.

01:14:15.425 --> 01:14:18.293
Oh, I think we've
waited quite long enough.

01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:19.794
Turk?

01:14:19.796 --> 01:14:21.262
Uh, now,
you see, in the long run,

01:14:21.264 --> 01:14:22.698
this is actually gonna
be a funny story.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.099
You're gonna laugh.

01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:26.568
But Mr. Green technically
owns the farm now.

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:30.071
Well, most of it, I
still own 10% of it.

01:14:30.073 --> 01:14:33.775
Actually, my associates
and I no longer feel

01:14:33.777 --> 01:14:36.011
your vision and
ours are aligned.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.479
What?

01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:38.681
We've decided to part
ways with you, Mr. Peterson.

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.048
Hold on, you can't
just cut me out.

01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:41.417
Oh, we can.

01:14:41.419 --> 01:14:43.153
In fact, we just did.

01:14:44.854 --> 01:14:47.922
You see, the property
is signed over today,

01:14:47.924 --> 01:14:51.360
and you said your part would
be taken care of ages ago.

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.495
Your wooing took far too long.

01:14:54.497 --> 01:14:55.433
Wooing me?

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.400
This was part of your
plan the whole time?

01:14:58.402 --> 01:15:00.034
I can see how it
looks like that,

01:15:00.036 --> 01:15:01.537
but if you give me
a couple of seconds,

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:02.570
I can show you that this
is financially beneficial

01:15:02.572 --> 01:15:04.172
for the both of, oof!

01:15:04.174 --> 01:15:06.208
Mom, tell
them to let Tanner go!

01:15:07.478 --> 01:15:09.744
Not somewhere you
wanna put your hand!

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.181
Look, whoever you
are, I made a mistake.

01:15:12.183 --> 01:15:13.849
I'm not selling you the farm.

01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:16.251
So you can get your goons
and get off my property.

01:15:16.253 --> 01:15:19.020
Tsk, such bad manners.

01:15:19.022 --> 01:15:21.155
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.

01:15:21.157 --> 01:15:22.690
My mother taught me better.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:26.494
Pretty please, with sugar
on top, get off my property.

01:15:26.496 --> 01:15:27.796
Much better.

01:15:27.798 --> 01:15:31.699
Unfortunately, this deed
says that this property

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.369
and everything on it is mine.

01:15:34.371 --> 01:15:35.870
Tanner?

01:15:35.872 --> 01:15:39.044
So pretty please,
with sugar on top,

01:15:39.943 --> 01:15:42.444
get off my property.

01:15:42.446 --> 01:15:43.578
You can't have him.

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:46.013
Amanda, come back!

01:15:46.015 --> 01:15:47.451
Amanda!

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.842
Cali, Cali, please,
you have to help.

01:16:14.844 --> 01:16:16.078
Amanda, what's wrong?

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.212
Some people are here
to destroy my farm.

01:16:18.214 --> 01:16:19.748
What is this?

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:21.382
Aleeda, please,
I'm begging you.

01:16:21.384 --> 01:16:26.154
They wanna destroy the farm and
they wanna take Tanner away.

01:16:26.156 --> 01:16:27.157
I'm sorry.

01:16:29.593 --> 01:16:30.825
We can't interfere.

01:16:32.595 --> 01:16:35.099
She didn't forget about you.

01:16:37.334 --> 01:16:40.002
I know you think she
did, but she didn't.

01:16:40.004 --> 01:16:41.740
She always loved you.

01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:50.048
She just got too old
to see you anymore.

01:16:51.182 --> 01:16:54.219
She would never turn
her back on you.

01:16:59.089 --> 01:17:00.388
You always said good
friends never let

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.423
a little trouble get in the way.

01:17:02.425 --> 01:17:04.329
I guess you were wrong.

01:17:28.251 --> 01:17:29.086
Cali.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.123
We're with you, Alanna.

01:17:34.325 --> 01:17:36.324
It isn't happening,
turn your rig around!

01:17:36.326 --> 01:17:38.025
We're not
going anywhere, pal.

01:17:38.027 --> 01:17:38.860
Hey, just take a breather.

01:17:38.862 --> 01:17:40.328
Keep calm, everybody.

01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:41.529
Come on, I'm sure we can come
to a reasonable solution.

01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:42.698
Just calm down.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.166
Well, we need you here now.

01:17:44.168 --> 01:17:45.335
Get over here.

01:17:53.076 --> 01:17:54.575
Get your kid outta here!

01:17:54.577 --> 01:17:56.744
Listen, if I could
control her, I would.

01:17:58.515 --> 01:17:59.349
Whew!

01:18:05.488 --> 01:18:06.587
Ow.

01:18:06.589 --> 01:18:07.922
Yeah!

01:18:07.924 --> 01:18:08.759
Ha ha!

01:18:10.326 --> 01:18:11.226
Ooh.

01:18:13.464 --> 01:18:14.466
I am done!

01:18:19.068 --> 01:18:22.404
I tried to play nicely
and do this legally,

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:25.810
but you are insistent
on forcing my hand.

01:18:26.977 --> 01:18:30.212
So now we'll do
this another way.

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:48.465
Stop!

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.835
Ah!

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:58.375
Fairies!

01:18:59.509 --> 01:19:00.475
Fly!

01:19:00.477 --> 01:19:03.747
Fairies!

01:19:07.317 --> 01:19:08.151
Whew!

01:19:09.652 --> 01:19:12.823
Yay, Aleeda.

01:19:21.999 --> 01:19:23.164
Ah.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.440
Get back here!

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:35.343
I don't know what games
you're playing here,

01:19:35.345 --> 01:19:38.879
but I assure you,
this is the end!

01:19:38.881 --> 01:19:40.617
Yes, I think it is.

01:19:46.589 --> 01:19:49.391
Who wants to tell me what
the blazes is going on here?

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:51.560
This guy was trying
to burn down the stable.

01:19:51.562 --> 01:19:52.793
Is that so?

01:19:52.795 --> 01:19:54.730
Sheriff, I think
you'll see here

01:19:54.732 --> 01:19:57.666
that I am the legal
owner of this property,

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:02.671
and as such, I have the right
to do with as I see fit.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.439
I guess technically
this is right.

01:20:04.441 --> 01:20:06.374
But, Charlie, there
are other circumstances.

01:20:06.376 --> 01:20:08.342
No, I'm sorry, darlin',

01:20:08.344 --> 01:20:10.779
but if he owned this property,
he'd be within his rights.

01:20:10.781 --> 01:20:11.946
- Thank you.
- That is,

01:20:11.948 --> 01:20:14.115
if he owned the property.

01:20:14.117 --> 01:20:15.417
What?

01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:17.452
- I just showed you the deed.
- I know.

01:20:17.454 --> 01:20:19.520
These papers say that you do.

01:20:19.522 --> 01:20:21.155
But the problem is I'm the one

01:20:21.157 --> 01:20:24.825
that did up the deed for
this place, and it was split.

01:20:24.827 --> 01:20:27.231
Yes, then the old bag died!

01:20:29.198 --> 01:20:30.865
It went to the mum!

01:20:30.867 --> 01:20:33.370
She signed, ya backwoods hick!

01:20:35.138 --> 01:20:37.004
Fair enough.

01:20:37.006 --> 01:20:40.976
Only thing is my good friend
Jean had me draw up a new will,

01:20:40.978 --> 01:20:44.645
singing her half
over to someone else.

01:20:46.517 --> 01:20:47.983
Me?

01:20:47.985 --> 01:20:50.722
Yes!

01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:56.525
What?

01:20:56.527 --> 01:20:59.997
So you got half the deed
signed, but you need both.

01:21:01.432 --> 01:21:03.565
Miss Amanda, you looking
to sell your half?

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:04.435
Never.

01:21:05.536 --> 01:21:07.034
Then it looks like
this contract is

01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:10.874
what we backwoods hicks
would call null and void.

01:21:14.277 --> 01:21:15.342
- Turk!
- Yep.

01:21:15.344 --> 01:21:17.445
Get my car.

01:21:17.447 --> 01:21:20.315
I'm leaving this
mannerless hole.

01:21:20.317 --> 01:21:23.051
I'm afraid that's
not gonna be possible.

01:21:23.053 --> 01:21:24.919
You tried to burn this down.

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:27.221
That is attempted arson.

01:21:27.223 --> 01:21:28.256
Ow!

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.725
They're too tight!

01:21:29.727 --> 01:21:32.993
That's for calling my
very good friend an old bag.

01:21:32.995 --> 01:21:35.062
Manners, Mr. Green.

01:21:35.898 --> 01:21:39.200
Ow!

01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:44.940
Won't you come down
to the station too,

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.475
little Turkey Pete?

01:21:46.477 --> 01:21:47.743
Oh, I'm not very
involved in this, I should...

01:21:47.745 --> 01:21:49.343
Oh, I'm
sure there's some kind

01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:51.178
of fraud charge
I can make stick.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.012
Come on.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.794
Thank you so much, guys.

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:08.029
You saved Tanner.

01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:09.864
What are friends for?

01:22:13.202 --> 01:22:14.037
Amanda.

01:22:14.937 --> 01:22:17.107
Look at the shooting star.

01:22:19.942 --> 01:22:21.309
Are you coming?

01:22:22.345 --> 01:22:23.544
What is it?

01:22:23.546 --> 01:22:24.715
A new fairy.

01:22:29.353 --> 01:22:30.618
Come one.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:31.852
Amanda,
where are you going?

01:22:31.854 --> 01:22:32.988
Why don't we just
stop fighting her

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.590
and see where she's going?

01:22:35.592 --> 01:22:36.591
Okay.

01:23:03.954 --> 01:23:04.985
Just trust me.

01:23:04.987 --> 01:23:06.223
You'll love it.

01:23:12.963 --> 01:23:14.229
A shooting star means

01:23:14.231 --> 01:23:16.664
that a new fairy will
be joining our family.

01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:19.836
Let's all welcome
them with open arms.

01:23:21.737 --> 01:23:25.407
Guys, I know this is hard
for you, but just believe.

01:23:25.409 --> 01:23:26.244
Just try.

01:23:28.144 --> 01:23:29.647
I'll try, but...

01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:36.754
Whoa.

01:23:37.687 --> 01:23:38.619
What?

01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:39.523
What is it?

01:23:46.863 --> 01:23:48.562
I see it.

01:23:48.564 --> 01:23:49.400
I see it.

01:23:53.303 --> 01:23:54.539
They're here.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.008
Let's party!

01:24:38.415 --> 01:24:39.247
Yay!

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.360
I can't believe it took
me so long to see this.

01:24:53.362 --> 01:24:54.464
It's amazing.

01:24:59.369 --> 01:25:00.705
They're ready.

01:25:07.009 --> 01:25:07.909
Who's ready?

01:25:07.911 --> 01:25:09.343
I don't know.

01:25:09.345 --> 01:25:11.445
I don't know, this fairy's
never come out before.

01:25:11.447 --> 01:25:15.283
They said they only come
out when they're ready.

01:25:29.265 --> 01:25:30.101
Pops.

01:26:39.536 --> 01:26:42.037
May I have this dance?

01:26:42.039 --> 01:26:45.209
Of course.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.946
I love you guys.

01:26:52.948 --> 01:26:55.786
From your first
breath to my last.
