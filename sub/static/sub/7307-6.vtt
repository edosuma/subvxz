WEBVTT

00:11.811 --> 00:13.720
This place is on fire!

00:15.398 --> 00:17.556
- Nice accent.
- Works for her.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.521
With all the sangria she's downed,
Swahili would work for her.

00:20.611 --> 00:21.892
Where'd Wilkes go?

00:21.988 --> 00:24.526
I don't know.
He just kind of wandered off.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.737
Gibbs. Talk.

01:55.247 --> 01:56.706
Gibbs, Stan Burley.

01:56.791 --> 02:00.409
Put down whatever the hell you're doing
with that stupid boat and pick up!

02:01.128 --> 02:03.121
I'm working a case on the Enterprise.

02:03.214 --> 02:05.456
Sure could use some help on this one.

02:07.259 --> 02:09.585
Really could use your help, boss.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.304
Okay, you got my interest.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.343
What's going on, Stan?

02:16.435 --> 02:17.514
Two days ago,

02:17.603 --> 02:20.521
an arresting gear operator
went wacko on liberty in Rota.

02:20.606 --> 02:23.179
His crewmates found him naked
in a restaurant freezer.

02:23.275 --> 02:25.268
His body temperature was 106.

02:25.444 --> 02:27.935
- What kind of drugs?
- Well, I'm thinking amphetamines.

02:28.030 --> 02:29.939
Still waiting for the tox report.

02:30.032 --> 02:32.357
Well, to trigger the seizure
you're describing,

02:32.451 --> 02:34.610
chances are he's a chronic drug user.

02:34.704 --> 02:37.574
You'd think. Only his
last random piss test was negative.

02:37.665 --> 02:39.456
That was less than three weeks ago.

02:43.629 --> 02:45.503
I'm in a squeeze, Gibbs.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.794
I don't have enough time
to work on this one by myself.

02:53.973 --> 02:55.681
How long did Burley work here?

02:55.766 --> 02:58.055
- Five years.
- Five years with Gibbs?

02:58.144 --> 03:00.144
I'm amazed the guy
didn't end up in a straitjacket.

03:00.229 --> 03:01.344
What was that?

03:01.439 --> 03:03.542
Nothing, boss.
Just praising your communication skills.

03:03.566 --> 03:06.353
I really miss Burley.
He was cool, you know?

03:06.444 --> 03:09.610
Listen, when you see Agent Burley,
would one of you mind giving him this?

03:09.697 --> 03:11.773
- No problem.
- Cricket ball.

03:12.324 --> 03:14.994
Yeah. Well, he was
not only an amazing agent,

03:15.077 --> 03:17.070
he was also an incredible athlete.

03:17.163 --> 03:20.329
Yet cricket was one of the few games
he wasn't an expert in.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.495
Shame.

03:22.543 --> 03:24.500
Yeah, I think he'll get a kick out of it.

03:24.587 --> 03:26.828
Of course he will.
He gets a kick out of everything.

03:26.922 --> 03:28.333
I love that guy.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.916
Okay. COD's waiting for us.

03:34.555 --> 03:37.342
Just accept the fact
that you're gonna get lost.

03:37.433 --> 03:40.600
- Why do you assume I'm going to?
- Because everyone does.

03:40.686 --> 03:43.687
A carrier is a big and confusing place
first time on board.

03:43.773 --> 03:44.887
Duly noted.

03:44.982 --> 03:47.022
Numbers are stencilled
on the bulkheads.

03:47.109 --> 03:49.814
First one tells you the deck level.
They're called bull's eyes.

03:49.904 --> 03:52.573
- Deck level.
- The second one, the frame number.

03:52.656 --> 03:54.982
Third tells you
the compartment's position

03:55.075 --> 03:56.819
in relation to the ship's centreline.

03:56.911 --> 03:59.746
The last letter tells you
what the space is used for.

03:59.830 --> 04:02.037
Crossing from port to starboard
or starboard to port

04:02.124 --> 04:03.765
isn't as simple as going straight across.

04:03.834 --> 04:06.242
Sometimes you gotta go up one deck
and down another.

04:06.337 --> 04:08.045
Or down one deck and up another.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.874
- Sometimes two.
- It's frustrating.

04:09.965 --> 04:12.587
Not to mention confusing.
But you'll get the hang of it.

04:12.676 --> 04:14.550
After you get lost a few times.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.551
Arresting gear control, this is Pri-Fly.

04:22.645 --> 04:24.471
We got a COD in the groove.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.022
Gear set for a COD.

04:29.485 --> 04:32.058
Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds to trap.

04:34.865 --> 04:36.241
You okay?

04:36.659 --> 04:37.773
Good.

04:37.868 --> 04:41.320
Just so you know,
this isn't like landing in a 747.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.456
I sort of assumed.

04:43.541 --> 04:47.953
Dropping from 120 knots to 0
in one second can take it out of you.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.583
Just try to...

04:53.551 --> 04:55.009
breathe normally.

04:59.056 --> 05:01.594
- Tox report come back yet, Stan?
- Just like we thought.

05:01.684 --> 05:03.059
Traces of meth in the bloodstream.

05:03.143 --> 05:05.931
And his urine was negative
just 27 days ago?

05:06.021 --> 05:08.429
According to the urinalysis coordinator,
clean as a whistle.

05:08.524 --> 05:11.727
- Where's this Petty Officer Wilkes now?
- Still in sickbay.

05:12.236 --> 05:13.695
You the one at my desk now?

05:13.779 --> 05:16.151
That's right.
Gibbs must've told you about me.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.398
Actually, no.
Abby mentioned it in passing.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.867
Just assigned?

05:19.952 --> 05:21.695
- Two years.
- Really?

05:26.458 --> 05:28.368
You said he was
an arresting gear operator?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.540
Yes, boss.

05:29.628 --> 05:31.940
The same crewmen working in Rota
working the flight deck here?

05:31.964 --> 05:34.585
All the men are on
Chief Petty Officer Reyes' crew.

05:34.675 --> 05:36.169
Anyone else suspected of using, Stan?

05:36.260 --> 05:38.632
- Not so far.
- Good.

05:40.306 --> 05:41.966
What buddies were with him that night?

05:42.057 --> 05:44.050
Petty Officers Niles and Shrewe.

05:44.143 --> 05:48.010
They berth on Deck 5.
Designator 5-56-2-L.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.275
I'll be fine.

05:52.651 --> 05:55.403
Oh, and this is for you from Ducky.

05:56.864 --> 05:59.485
If Wilkes was tweaking,
Reyes would've noticed.

05:59.575 --> 06:01.484
I didn't get much out of Reyes
in my interview.

06:01.577 --> 06:04.613
- You're welcome to try.
- You're looking good, Stanley.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.281
Appreciate you coming, boss.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.877
You waiting on something?

06:12.796 --> 06:15.038
No, no. I'm gone.

06:16.884 --> 06:18.153
I'd like to see Wilkes in action.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.466
Can you get me deck tapes of him
during flight ops?

06:20.554 --> 06:23.223
- Only about 100 hours.
- Is that all?

06:30.564 --> 06:31.727
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:36.904 --> 06:38.398
Okay.

06:38.489 --> 06:40.398
Can I help you, ma'am?

06:40.491 --> 06:44.191
This isn't the Deck 5
berthing compartment, is it?

06:44.286 --> 06:47.240
This is the men's head on Deck 6,
ma'am.

06:47.331 --> 06:50.201
Sorry, how do I get to Deck 5?

06:50.292 --> 06:53.079
You go aft past Bulkhead 126,

06:53.170 --> 06:55.412
down the starboard ladder,
through the hatch.

06:55.506 --> 06:57.913
- Thanks.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

06:59.843 --> 07:00.923
Aft.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.764
That's impossible. I don't use drugs.

07:10.854 --> 07:12.728
Your blood test says otherwise.

07:12.815 --> 07:14.606
Then it must be a false positive.

07:14.692 --> 07:16.920
Before you joined up,
you were an emergency medical tech.

07:16.944 --> 07:19.435
You tell me
how often that usually happens.

07:21.991 --> 07:23.817
Maybe it's just a whim.

07:24.284 --> 07:28.662
Or maybe you like hanging out
in walk-in freezers in your birthday suit.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.407
I don't know what happened, sir.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.626
I was feeling light-headed and hot.

07:37.715 --> 07:41.499
- Really hot.
- Well, your body temperature was 106.

07:41.677 --> 07:43.420
That's high enough to kill most men,

07:43.512 --> 07:45.884
unless their cardiovascular system
was being boosted

07:45.973 --> 07:48.131
by some sort of synthetic stimulant.

07:48.517 --> 07:50.370
Somebody must've slipped something
into my drink.

07:50.394 --> 07:51.972
Any idea who
that someone might've been?

07:52.062 --> 07:54.138
- No, sir.
- Any idea who provided the meth?

07:54.231 --> 07:55.346
No, sir!

07:55.441 --> 07:57.752
You know what? I'm trying
to help you out here, Petty Officer.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.563
If you try to float this story
at your court-martial hearing,

08:00.654 --> 08:03.228
they will laugh your ass
all the way to Leavenworth.

08:03.323 --> 08:05.150
Where did you get it? Shrewe?

08:05.242 --> 08:06.701
- No!
- From Niles?

08:07.786 --> 08:09.446
I don't do drugs.

08:09.872 --> 08:12.493
And no one else
on my crew does either.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.583
Deck 5 berthing?

08:21.008 --> 08:23.084
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank God.

08:23.844 --> 08:27.011
Ma'am, it's SOP. Women are
supposed to announce themselves

08:27.097 --> 08:29.173
in designated male quarters of the ship.

08:29.266 --> 08:32.350
NCIS Special Agent Kate Todd.
I'm announced.

08:32.936 --> 08:35.890
Can you tell me where I can find
Petty Officers Niles and Shrewe?

08:35.981 --> 08:37.179
I haven't seen Shrewe lately,

08:37.274 --> 08:39.847
but Niles just went up to work out
in the hangar bay.

08:39.943 --> 08:41.140
Hangar bay?

08:41.695 --> 08:44.779
Deck 1, frame number 150,

08:44.907 --> 08:46.946
the compartment next to usage Q.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.572
I'll be honest with you, ma'am.

08:52.664 --> 08:55.416
I did my fair share of partying
when I was in high school,

08:55.501 --> 08:57.327
experimented with pot and all that.

08:57.419 --> 08:59.993
- You still experimenting?
- Absolutely not, ma'am.

09:00.089 --> 09:03.540
Wildest I get now is a pitcher of sangria
and a couple of beers.

09:03.634 --> 09:05.757
I'd never even consider
something like meth.

09:05.844 --> 09:07.753
What about Petty Officer Wilkes?

09:07.846 --> 09:11.096
Solid as they come, ma'am.
Fourth-generation Navy.

09:11.391 --> 09:14.476
His grandfather was a gunner's mate
on the Arizona.

09:14.561 --> 09:16.803
Wilkes would never disgrace
the uniform.

09:16.897 --> 09:20.231
Well, I've got news for you,
Petty Officer Niles. He did.

09:22.486 --> 09:25.191
- I can't explain it, ma'am.
- Can't or won't?

09:25.405 --> 09:29.154
Code of silence stuff doesn't fly too well
on the flight deck, ma'am.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.360
There's no room for screw-ups.

09:33.664 --> 09:37.163
We're being temporarily rerouted
to assist in a search and rescue.

09:37.251 --> 09:40.252
A private yacht has gone missing.
We are closest to the area,

09:40.337 --> 09:42.495
so the Coast Guard
has requested our help.

09:42.589 --> 09:44.000
It's a shame really.

09:44.091 --> 09:47.424
So close to home, and these men now
have to turn around and go back.

09:47.511 --> 09:49.753
That's why you're resuming flight ops.

09:49.847 --> 09:52.005
If there's a drug problem,
I need it stopped.

09:52.099 --> 09:55.598
I need to know who it is and why
testing procedures haven't picked it up.

09:55.686 --> 09:58.603
- We'll do the best we can, Skipper.
- I'm sure you will.

09:58.689 --> 10:00.432
Lives depend on it.

10:11.102 --> 10:13.509
Those wires are looking tired,
gentlemen!

10:13.896 --> 10:18.357
Strip wire! Move! Move!
Double time! Let's go!

10:20.903 --> 10:22.812
Today, gentlemen, today!

10:22.905 --> 10:24.068
Hurry up!

10:24.156 --> 10:27.074
Thirty seconds
and the next Viking's on top of you!

10:27.159 --> 10:30.363
We're not sunbathing, Hancock!
Let's go! Let's go!

10:38.296 --> 10:39.754
Not up to speed.

10:41.257 --> 10:43.582
Two seconds slower than the last time.

10:46.137 --> 10:48.176
All right. Stand by.

10:48.264 --> 10:50.755
We've got an E-2 landing
in five minutes.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.268
I heard NCIS was bringing in
the cavalry.

10:57.898 --> 11:01.267
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
Pushing your guys pretty hard, Chief,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.851
considering it's just
a search and rescue run.

11:03.946 --> 11:06.947
I always push my men hard, sir.
They gotta be ready.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.274
Tomorrow it might not be
search and rescue.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.277
We might be back in the soup in Iraq.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.288
Still, don't you ever lay off,
give your men a break?

11:14.790 --> 11:17.281
My philosophy is if you gotta do a job,
you gotta do it right.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.626
110%.
That's why my men are the best, sir.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.703
How did Petty Officer Wilkes
handle being pushed?

11:23.799 --> 11:26.800
- He does okay.
- Ever show any signs of stress?

11:27.970 --> 11:31.422
Fourteen hours a day
on a flight deck during combat ops,

11:31.515 --> 11:33.674
everyone shows signs of stress, sir.

11:34.769 --> 11:37.438
You ever notice anything unusual
in his behaviour?

11:37.521 --> 11:39.977
Anxiety attacks? Irritability?
Mood swings?

11:40.524 --> 11:42.268
Not that I ever saw, sir.

11:46.155 --> 11:49.156
If there's nothing else,
I've gotta prepare for the next aircraft.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.356
Sir.

11:52.662 --> 11:55.034
Ready deck, E-2. Call the ball.

11:55.206 --> 11:57.245
Roger, Papa 1. Ball 2.5.

11:57.333 --> 12:01.283
The ball! Did he call the ball?
Did the flyer call the meatball?

12:02.046 --> 12:05.830
Get that green shirt off my deck.
We've got an aircraft on final approach.

12:07.134 --> 12:09.043
Shrewe, get off the deck!

12:09.136 --> 12:12.173
Wave him off, sir! Wave him off!

12:13.849 --> 12:15.344
Cable snap!

12:28.781 --> 12:31.698
We don't know for certain, but
I don't think he's in any real danger now.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.096
- I've got him pretty heavily sedated.
- What does it look like?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.264
I really won't know
until the tox report comes through.

12:36.288 --> 12:40.037
I appreciate that, Doc, but I don't have
time to wait for a tox report.

12:40.543 --> 12:43.876
In your considerable experience,
what's your best guess?

12:44.422 --> 12:47.422
It looks like the same situation we have
with Petty Officer Wilkes.

12:47.508 --> 12:49.714
- Methamphetamines?
- Yeah, most likely.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.296
Chronic, long-term use?

12:51.387 --> 12:53.011
With his symptoms, it would have to be.

12:53.097 --> 12:56.057
Yet his last random piss test was
negative, just like Petty Officer Wilkes.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.428
It doesn't make much sense.

12:57.518 --> 13:00.091
No, it doesn't.
When can I talk with him?

13:00.187 --> 13:02.346
That's hard for me to say, Agent Gibbs.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.432
Well, let me make it easier for you, Doc.

13:04.525 --> 13:05.723
1500.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.686
Consciousness will make the interview
go much smoother.

13:11.449 --> 13:13.322
- Toss Shrewe's rack.
- Got it.

13:13.409 --> 13:15.698
Go over everything,
and I mean everything.

13:15.786 --> 13:19.072
Above his mattress,
below his mattress, inside his mattress.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.453
If there's such a thing
as a fourth mattress dimension,

13:21.542 --> 13:22.657
go over that, too.

13:22.752 --> 13:25.871
Find out where the urinalysis
coordinator likes to let it all hang out.

13:25.963 --> 13:27.078
Okay.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.174
I wanna find out about
this testing procedure, how it all works.

13:30.259 --> 13:32.070
See if there's any way
that anyone can beat it.

13:32.094 --> 13:34.764
You and me, we're gonna have
a flight deck film festival.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.242
See if you can arrange some place
where we can watch those tapes.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.140
I have one of the ready rooms
on hold, boss.

13:39.226 --> 13:42.595
Always anticipating, Stan.
Some things never change.

14:00.498 --> 14:02.455
Can I help you, Petty Officer?

14:02.958 --> 14:05.247
Lot of messy racks around here lately.

14:05.461 --> 14:07.952
Gonna be a lot more
till we find what we're looking for.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.502
No disrespect, sir,
but like I told your partner,

14:10.591 --> 14:13.296
- none of the guys on my crew...
- "...on my crew use drugs."

14:13.385 --> 14:15.129
I've heard the party line so many times,

14:15.221 --> 14:17.972
it's like a bad song
I can't get out of my head.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.431
- You don't understand, sir!
- I do understand!

14:23.521 --> 14:26.208
Two of your guys are in sickbay
with enough meth in their bloodstreams

14:26.232 --> 14:28.105
to kill a herd of Navy goats.

14:29.485 --> 14:33.530
For a crew that doesn't do drugs,
you guys sure do a lot of drugs.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.867
- Got ants in his pants?
- Question is, who's putting them there?

14:39.954 --> 14:42.361
Rota was our last liberty port
after we left the Gulf.

14:42.456 --> 14:44.663
This tape was done
before they hit Rota.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.158
Well, maybe he stocked up
at Naples or Nice.

14:47.253 --> 14:51.202
Is that the best you can do, Stan,
after working under me five years?

14:51.715 --> 14:54.586
At least I don't taint evidence
when I bag and tag.

14:55.010 --> 14:56.339
I tripped.

14:56.804 --> 14:57.918
One time.

14:58.013 --> 15:00.617
As I remember, it's because you had
your eyes glued to some little...

15:00.641 --> 15:02.847
Do you mind
if we get back to the tape now?

15:02.935 --> 15:05.852
- Sure, boss.
- We have a job to do, remember?

15:05.938 --> 15:07.183
I do, boss.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.221
Good.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.109
- Petty Officer.
- Ma'am?

15:19.201 --> 15:21.871
You just came out of
the urinalysis coordinator's office.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.362
I hope not, ma'am.
I just got a haircut in there.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.452
Go ahead.
Tell me how many bulkheads,

15:28.544 --> 15:31.664
hatches and passageways
I have to traverse to get there.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.874
It's right next door.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.338
Of course it is. Thank you, Petty Officer.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.054
No problem, ma'am.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.890
We don't do the actual testing on board.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.267
What we do is, we collect the samples,
we record the data,

15:48.355 --> 15:50.264
and ship them off to a land-based lab.

15:50.357 --> 15:53.691
Obviously with such a large crew,
you test them in batches.

15:53.777 --> 15:57.277
Computer generates a random list,
about 25 to 30 a day.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.077
- Do you watch?
- Of course we watch.

16:04.705 --> 16:06.641
Someone from security
accompanies them to the head

16:06.665 --> 16:07.994
and observes casually by mirror.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.159
And if someone wanted to beat it?

16:10.502 --> 16:11.582
Ma'am?

16:13.380 --> 16:15.420
- The system.
- Oh.

16:16.050 --> 16:19.584
They try.
Detox drinks, herbal tea, vinegar.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.885
Some try slipping bleach crystals in.

16:21.972 --> 16:25.222
Or even passing off
a shipmate's clean sample as their own.

16:25.309 --> 16:27.847
How do they do that
if they're being watched?

16:32.942 --> 16:36.108
You fill it up with someone else's urine,
slip the balloon in your underwear,

16:36.195 --> 16:37.986
and tape the tube
to the underside of your...

16:38.072 --> 16:39.780
I get the picture.

16:41.283 --> 16:42.694
Obviously it didn't work.

16:42.785 --> 16:46.035
Well, balloons aren't the sturdiest
of containers. If you want to examine it.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.781
That won't be necessary.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.173
How about the other methods
that you mentioned?

16:51.210 --> 16:52.752
Most of them don't fly.

16:52.836 --> 16:54.959
But every once in a while
one does slip through.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.541
No system's perfect.

16:57.299 --> 16:59.873
- How about twice within six weeks?
- Unlikely.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.960
But like I said, anything's possible.

17:05.683 --> 17:07.722
- Lost?
- No.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.089
How's it going?

17:09.686 --> 17:11.205
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.540
Finding your way
around the ship and all.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.644
It's going fine.

17:13.732 --> 17:18.358
- Good, I'm glad. Really glad.
- I admit, it was a little confusing at first.

17:18.444 --> 17:21.398
- I had a few, you know...
- False starts.

17:23.492 --> 17:25.200
Complete disasters.

17:25.994 --> 17:28.912
But I think I've got
a pretty good handle on it now.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.160
Good.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.251
This is the second time
I have had to come down here

17:35.337 --> 17:37.413
to talk to a member of your crew.

17:38.007 --> 17:39.465
I don't know what to tell you, sir.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.255
Why don't you tell me
how two members of the same crew

17:42.344 --> 17:43.673
who work the same team

17:43.762 --> 17:46.597
flip out on meth
within a few days of each other?

17:46.682 --> 17:48.840
- Meth?
- Yeah.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.973
It's a fine, little, white powder
cooked up in trailer parks.

17:52.062 --> 17:53.438
Makes people do funny things,

17:53.522 --> 17:56.973
like freak out on a flight deck
with a plane on final approach.

17:57.568 --> 17:59.607
Sir, there's gotta be a mistake.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.487
I've never done drugs.

18:01.572 --> 18:03.944
- Never?
- Not once in my life, sir.

18:04.491 --> 18:05.902
It's against my morals.

18:05.993 --> 18:08.698
I feel the same way
about alcohol and tobacco.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.075
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

18:15.377 --> 18:19.161
I even reported a guy
for smoking some pot on my last cruise.

18:20.924 --> 18:24.459
Well, it makes a nice story
to cover your own ass

18:24.553 --> 18:27.009
in case they catch you
with the real deal.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.930
I'm telling the truth, sir.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.842
Code blue! We've got a code blue!

18:31.935 --> 18:33.595
- Crash cart!
- Coming in.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.690
Start the charge.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.937
Lead lines in. Charge to 200 joules.

18:41.070 --> 18:42.184
Charging.

18:42.279 --> 18:43.904
- All clear.
- Clear.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.566
- No response.
- 300 joules!

18:46.658 --> 18:47.903
Charging.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.488
All clear.

18:51.538 --> 18:52.618
360?

18:55.084 --> 18:56.412
Won't help.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.137
FOD walk, gentlemen.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.677
Keep your eyes peeled.
Don't miss a thing.

19:18.141 --> 19:22.090
Wilkes was killed probably because
he was gonna give up the supplier.

19:22.478 --> 19:23.558
Makes sense.

19:23.646 --> 19:26.932
No, what makes no sense
is that these boys are involved at all.

19:27.025 --> 19:30.939
Now, Wilkes was a proud navy legacy.
You know, Shrewe was a boy scout.

19:31.029 --> 19:32.606
That's what they want you to think.

19:32.697 --> 19:35.318
Drugs addicts learn
the art of the con fast.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.733
Well, I had the lab
that tested the urine samples

19:37.827 --> 19:39.784
send them to Abby for retesting.

19:39.871 --> 19:41.282
- Good.
- Where's Burley?

19:41.372 --> 19:44.457
- Watching more flight deck footage.
- Still?

19:44.792 --> 19:47.330
Yeah, he's been at it
almost 18 hours now.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.128
He's always been this way.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.257
I'll go see how he's doing.

19:55.970 --> 19:58.010
It's not the same thing, you know.

19:58.556 --> 20:01.759
- What?
- You and Gibbs, Burley and Gibbs.

20:01.851 --> 20:03.642
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:03.728 --> 20:06.480
It was a different dynamic,
you know, a different time.

20:06.564 --> 20:08.770
You can't compare the relationships.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.354
Who's comparing?

20:10.443 --> 20:11.902
All I'm saying is that

20:11.986 --> 20:14.228
things on the surface
are not always the same

20:14.322 --> 20:17.192
as when you put them in context
with the way they actually developed,

20:17.283 --> 20:20.319
you know, under the surface. Kind of.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.455
- I have no idea what you said.
- Neither do I.

20:24.582 --> 20:26.456
But the intent was sincere.

20:28.878 --> 20:32.579
Petty Officer Robert Wilkes.

20:33.341 --> 20:36.010
You are a bit of a puzzle,
aren't you, my lad?

20:36.344 --> 20:38.835
A secured room, no sign of trauma.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.297
No bruising or ligature marks.

20:42.517 --> 20:47.013
Let's rule out strangulation.
If that's okay by you.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.519
Colour's good. No cyanosis.

20:49.607 --> 20:52.478
You weren't suffocated by a pillow.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.694
Poisoned, perhaps.

21:01.077 --> 21:04.991
We'll soon see.
You'll tell Ducky everything, eventually.

21:06.207 --> 21:08.081
They all do, you know.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.204
Brought you a bagel.

21:12.088 --> 21:13.416
You remembered.

21:13.798 --> 21:17.498
Bacon, sausage, eggs, onions,
cream cheese, and jalapenos.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.678
- Do you wanna fill me in here?
- This is interesting.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.389
What is Chief Petty Officer Reyes
handing them?

21:27.478 --> 21:29.601
It's hard to tell from this distance.

21:29.981 --> 21:32.554
- Can you get closer?
- We'll have to enhance the tape.

21:32.650 --> 21:36.019
Uplink the footage to Abby.
First find DiNozzo and Kate.

21:36.112 --> 21:38.781
Have them check out
the Air Boss' take on Reyes.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.570
Got a little glob
on your shirt there, Stan.

21:48.791 --> 21:51.709
Twenty-five more burpies.
Get on it! Let's go! Let's go!

21:51.794 --> 21:54.581
Chief Reyes is one of the most
committed men I've ever worked with.

21:54.672 --> 21:57.792
- He runs his crew hard.
- And they appreciate him for it.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.212
Aside from the two incidents,

21:59.302 --> 22:01.905
have you noticed anything out of
the ordinary in the past few weeks?

22:01.929 --> 22:04.171
Not unless you consider
a 50% above average performance

22:04.265 --> 22:05.380
out of the ordinary.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.724
That's quite a record.

22:07.810 --> 22:09.719
With two new guys,
he's falling behind a little,

22:09.812 --> 22:11.556
but that's expected.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.602
He'll get them up to speed.
He always does.

22:14.692 --> 22:19.105
- Come on! Let's go! Work it! Work it!
- Why get them up to speed at all?

22:19.197 --> 22:22.114
It's only a rescue mission
after which they're going home.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.991
Because that's Chief Reyes, ma'am.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.108
Work it out!

22:25.203 --> 22:27.029
What's your problem, Hatcher?
Getting winded?

22:27.121 --> 22:29.695
Girlfriend teach you
anything about stamina?

22:29.790 --> 22:31.333
You're playing catch-up!

22:31.417 --> 22:34.204
Lose this race,
you'll be tooth-brushing urinals!

22:34.712 --> 22:38.330
You think this wasn't a race, huh?
Just thought it was an exercise!

22:39.884 --> 22:41.212
Well, well.

22:41.552 --> 22:44.387
We finally find something
you're good at, Hatcher.

22:44.472 --> 22:45.551
Lying down!

22:51.395 --> 22:53.139
What are you looking at, Stewart?

22:53.231 --> 22:56.481
Did I say stop? Give me 25 more!

22:56.567 --> 22:58.275
Let's go! Let's go!

23:01.030 --> 23:05.609
And well, here is Petty Officer Wilkes
with an IV drip going into his arm.

23:06.744 --> 23:09.152
Please, Gerald,
this is not dinner theatre.

23:09.247 --> 23:13.992
Suppose someone
disconnected his IV tube

23:14.293 --> 23:15.752
at both ends,

23:16.295 --> 23:19.747
and blew all the liquid out of the tube,

23:19.840 --> 23:21.548
leaving nothing but air.

23:21.634 --> 23:26.343
Suppose they emptied
the saline bag half way.

23:27.181 --> 23:29.221
That should be about it.

23:30.351 --> 23:33.802
The IV tube is attached.

23:34.105 --> 23:38.814
This blue balloon taped to Gerald's arm
represents his vein.

23:39.777 --> 23:43.027
And a valve is inserted into the bag.

23:43.781 --> 23:48.443
Air is blown into the tube
using this one-way valve.

23:50.913 --> 23:53.202
The air is trapped.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.250
When I open the flow rate valve

23:59.297 --> 24:00.755
and squeeze,

24:02.592 --> 24:05.379
air is pushed down the tube

24:05.553 --> 24:08.470
and into the vein and death occurs

24:09.265 --> 24:11.341
within 60 seconds.

24:15.563 --> 24:17.187
I do apologise.

24:17.523 --> 24:20.607
- So that's what killed Wilkes?
- I'm pretty certain.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.445
Any way the air could've gotten
into the line accidentally?

24:23.529 --> 24:27.574
Normal air is less than
1% carbon dioxide.

24:27.658 --> 24:32.036
The gas bubble
in Wilkes' heart was 6% CO2.

24:32.538 --> 24:35.741
That's not air, that was breath.
It was deliberate.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.576
So, Doc,
this would've had to have been done

24:37.668 --> 24:39.210
by someone with medical knowledge?

24:39.295 --> 24:40.575
Most certainly.

24:41.339 --> 24:42.881
You're supposed to be dead.

24:43.174 --> 24:46.839
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll have Burley meet me in sickbay.

24:46.927 --> 24:49.335
Burley's probably got his hands full
uplinking the tapes.

24:49.430 --> 24:51.387
If you want, I'd be happy to...

24:52.933 --> 24:55.341
I had no reason to kill
Petty Officer Wilkes, sir.

24:55.436 --> 24:58.057
Not unless you were supplying him
methamphetamines

24:58.147 --> 24:59.890
and you were afraid he would talk.

24:59.982 --> 25:01.013
I wasn't.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.516
Your prints were all over
that saline bag.

25:03.611 --> 25:05.153
Sir, I was the attending corpsman.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.360
My prints are supposed to be
on that bag.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.533
Petty Officer Wilkes was alive
when I went to change that bag out.

25:12.620 --> 25:14.529
When I came back, he was dead.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.657
That's the truth, sir.

25:18.626 --> 25:20.334
Give me a polygraph.

25:21.003 --> 25:23.043
Anything. But that is the truth.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.499
- Where have you been?
- Waiting for a print match.

25:27.593 --> 25:29.112
You were supposed
to meet me here, Stan.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.796
I thought this was more important.

25:30.888 --> 25:32.949
Why don't you let me
be the judge of what's important?

25:32.973 --> 25:34.218
- Yes, boss.
- I mean,

25:34.308 --> 25:36.550
that is why you called me, right?

25:37.520 --> 25:39.915
You know, it's funny how it's all starting
to come back to me now.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.053
What's that?

25:41.148 --> 25:42.501
The tightness in my chest,
the upset stomach.

25:42.525 --> 25:44.461
All the pleasantries
that come with working for you.

25:44.485 --> 25:46.941
Your breathing's not laboured.
You're fine.

25:47.363 --> 25:48.857
What have you got?

25:49.490 --> 25:52.444
There were a second set of prints
on the saline bag.

25:53.703 --> 25:55.861
- Wilkes?
- You knew he used to be an EMT.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.153
You think he killed himself?

25:57.248 --> 26:01.032
One of the doctors bent a few rules,
let Wilkes take a call from his father.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.285
His very proud,

26:06.048 --> 26:09.215
retired Chief Petty Officer father.

26:11.887 --> 26:16.217
So Wilkes' urine was clean.
No nasty metabolites, no additives.

26:16.726 --> 26:18.932
There's just one tiny problem.

26:19.395 --> 26:20.723
Look at this.

26:24.233 --> 26:27.400
It's the exact same urine
as Petty Officer Shrewe.

26:30.448 --> 26:33.733
- Someone's replacing their samples.
- The urinalysis coordinator?

26:33.826 --> 26:37.409
Maybe. Or maybe one of the 25
Masters at Arms he uses to monitor.

26:37.496 --> 26:40.118
We need to look at the records
of all the people on pee patrol.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.832
So anybody happy about this?

26:41.917 --> 26:44.622
Anybody freaked out?
It'd be nice to have something here.

26:44.712 --> 26:46.918
Sorry, Abby.
It's just that we both really gotta go.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.963
What do you want me to do
with all this pee?

26:49.133 --> 26:51.422
No, it's 3-76-9-A.

26:51.594 --> 26:53.752
We're at 5-45-7-E.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.755
We need to go up two levels,
over to port,

26:55.848 --> 26:56.950
and then three bulkheads aft.

26:56.974 --> 26:58.765
No, which is why
we need to go up one level

26:58.851 --> 27:00.725
so we can traverse port
before heading out.

27:00.811 --> 27:04.595
The ladder two bulkheads down
takes us up and across.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.502
Is this going to turn into
one of those guy-girl things

27:07.526 --> 27:09.435
where you insist we stop
and ask for directions?

27:09.528 --> 27:12.233
No. Because unlike you,
I know where I'm going.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.199
Then be my guest.

27:16.452 --> 27:18.076
I'll be in Admin!

27:39.433 --> 27:40.808
Can I help you?

27:41.602 --> 27:44.058
Special Agent Kate Todd, NCIS.

27:44.146 --> 27:46.471
I need to see
some record books, please.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.947
Excuse me, sir.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.494
I was able to bring it way up.
Take a look at this.

28:07.545 --> 28:08.920
Much better.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.297
Right there.
Abby, can you get us in closer?

28:12.383 --> 28:15.253
Patience, Gibbs. You can't rush art.

28:19.890 --> 28:23.425
Smart money says
that that is not a tic tac.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.269
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

28:36.949 --> 28:39.440
- Chief Reyes?
- Yes.

28:41.203 --> 28:43.326
We haven't been introduced.

28:44.039 --> 28:46.613
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

28:46.834 --> 28:49.503
You already know Special Agent Burley.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.118
What can I do for you, sir?

28:51.213 --> 28:52.694
You can give me one of those capsules

28:52.756 --> 28:55.544
you gave Petty Officer Wilkes
during flight ops.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.713
Sir?

28:56.802 --> 28:59.293
We have it all
on a flight deck tape, Chief.

29:01.765 --> 29:03.618
You can see a capsule
from that camera up there?

29:03.642 --> 29:05.350
We had it digitally enhanced.

29:05.436 --> 29:08.721
I can see the hairs standing up
on the back of your neck!

29:18.866 --> 29:20.989
What do you think those are, sir?

29:21.452 --> 29:22.863
Meth, Chief.

29:23.454 --> 29:26.455
Meth? That's 98% caffeine.

29:26.790 --> 29:29.791
Available over the counter
at any pharmacy in Norfolk.

29:30.252 --> 29:31.711
Coffee's not allowed on the deck,

29:31.795 --> 29:34.084
so I give it to my men
to keep them going.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.257
I would never do anything
to jeopardise these men, sir.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.967
I love these men

29:40.304 --> 29:42.510
and I would die for these men.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.751
Standard test pouches.
Just like I used in Baltimore.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.374
Yeah, DiNozzo was a Baltimore cop
before coming to us.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.421
Is that right? How long?

30:00.925 --> 30:03.167
- Almost two years.
- And before that?

30:03.594 --> 30:04.923
Philly P.D.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.012
Eighteen months, right?

30:07.682 --> 30:09.758
There were extenuating circumstances.

30:09.850 --> 30:12.638
And what was before Philly, I forgot.
Pittsburgh?

30:13.813 --> 30:15.640
- Peoria.
- Right.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.683
And it doesn't matter how long.

30:17.775 --> 30:20.693
All that matters now
is that I'm here at NCIS.

30:20.778 --> 30:24.562
And you've been here for...
Refresh my memory.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.028
Two years.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.445
What did you do before NCIS, Burley?

30:30.538 --> 30:33.029
Just pushing papers around
in Washington.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.951
I'm sure it wasn't so bad.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.747
How bad could being
a senator's aide be?

30:42.300 --> 30:43.758
It wasn't me.

30:44.385 --> 30:47.635
- DiNozzo, the kit.
- Yeah.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.175
The way it works is simple.

30:50.266 --> 30:54.394
Place a small sample of the suspected
substance inside the pouch.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.676
Seal it.

30:56.564 --> 31:00.431
Break the ampoule inside the pouch
which releases the test chemicals.

31:01.777 --> 31:04.944
If the clear liquid turns a colour,
we have drugs.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.730
Not meth.

31:10.453 --> 31:14.285
That pouch might be clear,
but my gut's still in living colour.

31:16.208 --> 31:20.123
All right, get a search authorisation.
Sweep Chief Petty Officer Reyes' rack.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.332
Wait until he's occupied with flight ops
in the morning.

31:28.137 --> 31:31.471
Now! Now! Now!
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

31:31.557 --> 31:32.886
Bridge. Air Boss.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.220
Go, boss.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.468
Skipper, Mauler Two
has located the yacht.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.104
There are survivors in the water.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.273
153 miles out on 260.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.360
Launch the rescue bird.

31:43.444 --> 31:44.689
Aye, aye, sir.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.408
There's nothing here.

31:51.035 --> 31:52.992
Nothing that's obvious anyway.

31:53.079 --> 31:56.033
Then I'd say it's time we turn out
the lights and play in the dark.

31:56.457 --> 32:00.289
Anywhere Chief Petty Officer Reyes
touches can leave residue.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.619
I might have something here.

32:04.298 --> 32:07.252
- Could be toothpaste.
- Could be meth. Bag it.

32:08.886 --> 32:10.428
Hold it. Tony?

32:30.741 --> 32:33.066
No, it looks the same as
the Alert capsule we tested.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.987
You think
we're barking up the wrong tree?

32:35.079 --> 32:37.534
Actually, I was thinking
just the opposite.

32:37.707 --> 32:42.167
Why have the contents of an Alert
capsule loose on your locker shelf?

32:42.336 --> 32:45.005
Unless you emptied it
so you can fill it up with something else.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.414
Then why didn't we find
traces of speed?

32:47.508 --> 32:50.177
Because you can be sure
Reyes has taken extra precautions

32:50.261 --> 32:51.838
with a substance that can put him away.

32:51.929 --> 32:54.716
Okay. Then how do we link Reyes
to the meth?

32:54.807 --> 32:57.380
By going to the one guy
from the original crew

32:57.476 --> 32:59.516
who still might be holding some.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.480
A little jumpy today, Petty Officer.

33:09.572 --> 33:13.735
No, you know, I just get a little nervous
when it gets close to duty time.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.902
Reyes works you hard
on that flight deck.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.664
Yes, sir. You gotta keep on top of it.

33:18.748 --> 33:22.247
- Sounds exhausting to me.
- Nothing I can't handle, sir.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.503
Especially when you have yourself
a little pick-me-up.

33:25.588 --> 33:28.375
Sir, I don't know how many times
we gotta go over this,

33:28.466 --> 33:31.336
- but I've been telling you...
- This is the last time, I promise.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.716
My crew is tossing your rack
as we speak.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.512
They're not gonna find anything.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.923
Maybe that's because
you have it on you.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.260
You wanna search me? Go ahead.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.935
But I'm telling you, the only pick-me-up
I use is a cup of coffee

33:44.023 --> 33:47.356
before I go on duty
and a couple of these when I'm on deck.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.693
Mind if I hang on to these?

33:57.787 --> 33:59.067
No, sir.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.168
Meth disguised as caffeine capsules.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.377
I'm assuming you didn't find anything
in Petty Officer Niles' rack.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.880
Clean as a whistle.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.005
They've been telling the truth all along.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.052
They were getting hooked and
they didn't even know they were using.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.467
How in the hell could a Chief
feed his own guys speed?

34:23.562 --> 34:24.762
Are we gonna bring him in now?

34:24.855 --> 34:27.773
Not yet. All we have is
a Petty Officer in possession

34:27.858 --> 34:31.192
who claims his highly-regarded superior
gave it to him without his knowledge.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.353
Yeah, it won't fly well with JAG.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.400
We wanna get him
with the evidence in hand.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.043
I'm a little worried
about your crew, Chief.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.315
They're not where they should be.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.379
I'm pushing them, sir,
but I got two new guys.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.922
Then push them harder.
Your boys have to be sharp.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.252
- They will be, sir.
- I hope so, Chief.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.837
This will be our last ops
before we head back home.

34:59.932 --> 35:04.095
I'd sure hate to go out on a low note,
not after what we've all accomplished.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.013
I won't let you down, sir.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.063
I know you won't.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.820
The Air Boss, sir.

35:23.414 --> 35:26.119
I didn't like it, Skipper, but I did it.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.000
I appreciate it, Commander.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.934
Rescue One is on location

35:52.026 --> 35:54.481
and have commenced
rescue operations.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.776
Bring them on up!

35:59.283 --> 36:00.563
Hang on, hang on!

36:02.745 --> 36:05.746
We have two survivors on board.
Returning home.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.992
Well done, Rescue One.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.748
Alert sickbay to stand by for casualties.
Recall the search aircraft.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.035
Yes, sir.

36:30.898 --> 36:34.765
As you have probably already guessed,
we're not here to make a deposit.

36:34.902 --> 36:36.978
More like a withdrawal, actually.

36:38.072 --> 36:39.716
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.112
I think you do, Lieutenant.
Your service record indicates

36:42.201 --> 36:44.679
you and Chief Reyes have served
on three different ships together.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.490
On each one, the Chief's crew
had the distinction of maintaining

36:47.581 --> 36:48.910
the highest performance rating.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.659
Thanks, of course, to his capsules

36:50.751 --> 36:53.289
and your help
in covering up the urine tests.

36:53.963 --> 36:55.670
It's over, Lieutenant.

36:58.092 --> 37:00.084
Before you pee your pants,

37:01.345 --> 37:04.050
why don't you show us
where he keeps his stash?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.532
Have all search aircraft
been recovered?

37:24.618 --> 37:27.156
- Last two aircraft are down, sir.
- Take us home.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.829
Aye, aye, sir. Set your course, 270.

37:42.845 --> 37:44.614
Why the hell aren't you
on the flight deck, Niles?

37:44.638 --> 37:46.880
I don't know, Chief.
I ain't felling so hot right now.

37:46.974 --> 37:49.119
What do you mean you don't know?
We got aircraft coming in.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.515
I'm beat, man.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.308
You gotta get it together, Petty Officer.
You gotta suck it up.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.189
I don't think I can, Chief.

37:58.027 --> 37:59.355
Come here.

38:02.364 --> 38:04.108
This should help you out.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.867
Just one, Chief?

38:12.207 --> 38:14.117
Now get the hell on the deck.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.940
It's okay, son.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.860
You followed orders.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.529
That's what a good sailor does.

38:54.583 --> 38:55.958
Go on, now.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.976
Thanks.

39:30.410 --> 39:34.704
These men spent 10 months
in the Gulf, combat conditions.

39:35.374 --> 39:38.540
Twelve hours a day,
110 degrees on the deck.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.247
With you in their face,
pumping them up with meth.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.294
I gave my men something
to help them do their jobs better,

39:48.804 --> 39:49.835
and it worked.

39:49.930 --> 39:52.255
Explain that to Wilkes' family.

39:55.102 --> 39:59.146
I'm sorry about what happened,
but I'm not gonna make excuses.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.348
We got our planes on the deck
and out of harm's way

40:02.442 --> 40:04.565
faster than any other crew.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.985
Wilkes was a casualty of war,
Agent Gibbs.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.195
A hero.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.320
Yes, he was, Chief.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.698
He was also a victim

40:18.083 --> 40:20.574
of a leader who betrayed his trust.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.439
I have to say it was like déjà vu
working with you again, boss.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.849
- Good déjà vu or bad?
- Good.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.771
- And bad.
- And bad.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.938
You know, boss, in all seriousness,

40:50.616 --> 40:52.573
you know how much
it means to me that we...

40:52.659 --> 40:55.446
Hell, Stan, you gonna go
getting all huggy on me?

40:56.163 --> 40:59.033
- I guess I'm not.
- I didn't think so.

41:00.209 --> 41:01.786
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:05.047 --> 41:07.372
- See you.
- See you, Stan. Thanks.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.922
You know, in the two years
I've worked for Gibbs,

41:11.011 --> 41:13.549
he's never shaken my hand once.
Never.

41:13.639 --> 41:16.758
I was in the office two years
before he even looked me in the eye.

41:16.850 --> 41:17.881
Really?

41:17.976 --> 41:20.301
Yeah. Three years before
he called me by name.

41:20.395 --> 41:21.973
Four till he got it right.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.148
By then I'd actually
gotten used to Steve.

41:27.736 --> 41:29.693
He must really like you.

41:35.077 --> 41:36.275
Thanks.

41:41.333 --> 41:45.662
The cat launch is like the wire landing,
only in reverse.

41:46.004 --> 41:50.666
We go from 0 to 140 knots
in a second and a half.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.965
It's kind of like sex
without all that work.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.591
Everything is like sex to you, Tony.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.469
Cross your arms, chin to your chest.

41:59.101 --> 42:02.635
- Lean forward as far as you can.
- And breathe normally.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.943
How you doing, Kate? Kate?

42:10.654 --> 42:12.730
DiNozzo, how's she doing?

42:13.657 --> 42:15.151
She's smiling.
