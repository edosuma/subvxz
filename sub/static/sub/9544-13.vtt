00:54.571 --> 00:58.559
- I was gettin' worried.
- You didn't think I'd show, did you?

00:58.594 --> 01:01.112
- I'm not afraid of you, Ray.
- No reason to be.

01:01.147 --> 01:02.512
So, what's all this about a deal?

01:02.547 --> 01:04.586
I just wanted to talk to you, man to man.

01:04.620 --> 01:05.717
Without the judge and the lawyers.

01:05.752 --> 01:08.151
If you think we're withdrawing
that lawsuit, you can forget it.

01:08.186 --> 01:11.557
Hey, look, kid. Steve.

01:11.592 --> 01:14.200
You don't think I care about
the environment, but I do.

01:14.235 --> 01:16.165
My heart bleeds for the albino whip snakes.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.552
- Alameda whip snakes.
- Whatever.

01:18.587 --> 01:21.274
Look, I got 85 guys workin' on this crew.

01:21.309 --> 01:24.194
And they all got families.
And I care about them, too.

01:24.229 --> 01:26.872
When you called, I thought you were
going to offer to sell the land back

01:26.907 --> 01:28.971
so you could build your stupid
strip mall someplace else.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.004
And start all over again?
I'd lose my shirt.

01:31.039 --> 01:33.370
I'm already hemorrhaging money
thanks to you and your buddies.

01:33.405 --> 01:34.843
Steve, Steve,
wait, wait, wait. Steve,

01:34.878 --> 01:37.033
Hold on, hold on.

01:37.068 --> 01:38.690
Come on, now.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.536
You got expenses, right?

01:40.571 --> 01:44.892
Now, what will it take for you
to find another swamp to cry over, huh?

01:44.927 --> 01:46.819
You're trying to bribe me, Ray?

01:46.854 --> 01:49.100
Who do you think I am, you?

01:51.947 --> 01:53.419
Listen, I told you,
this isn't about me.

01:53.454 --> 01:56.934
It's about an endangered species that
doesn't live anyplace else on the planet.

01:56.969 --> 01:59.160
Oh, what the hell is a whip snake?
Will you tell me?

01:59.195 --> 02:03.067
You know, I've never seen one
in my life. Have you?

02:04.017 --> 02:07.594
I'll see you in court, Ray.

02:07.629 --> 02:10.555
Okay, look, Steve, Steve.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.704
I guess...

02:12.739 --> 02:16.327
I guess I just didn't appreciate
how deeply you felt about this thing.

02:16.342 --> 02:19.440
I get it now, I do. Come on.

02:19.475 --> 02:23.681
I hate to argue with a passionate guy,
And that is what you are.

02:23.716 --> 02:25.536
A passionate guy. Huh?

02:25.571 --> 02:27.763
Ah.

02:27.798 --> 02:29.002
What are you doin'?

02:29.037 --> 02:31.391
Well, I gotta find a pipe.
It's gotta be the right size.

02:31.426 --> 02:34.445
- Not too big, not too small.
- For what?

02:34.480 --> 02:39.483
Well, it's gotta look like you hit
your head on the steering wheel.

02:42.336 --> 02:45.264
Whip snakes.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.869
MONK Season 3 Epi. 13
Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic

03:47.891 --> 03:49.903
Seatbelts on?
Everybody, seatbelt check.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.741
- Yes, yes. They're on, they're on.
- That was the 20th time.

03:52.776 --> 03:57.421
Well, that was really,
you know, fun.

03:57.456 --> 04:00.122
Who knew that spending four hours in a car

04:00.157 --> 04:03.475
to watch a two-hour field
hockey game could be so much fun?

04:03.510 --> 04:07.375
Thanks for inviting me.
When's your next game?

04:07.410 --> 04:09.264
Oh, that was, uh,
Julie's last game of the season.

04:09.299 --> 04:11.816
Oh, that's too bad.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.343
Mom, I gotta go.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.103
Sweetie, why didn't you go at the game?
There was a porta-john right there.

04:16.137 --> 04:19.440
I wanted to, but Mr. Monk says
it wasn't sanitary.

04:19.475 --> 04:22.855
- You'll thank me later.
- I'm going to pee all over the seat.

04:22.890 --> 04:23.835
- Natalie.
- Honey, honey,

04:23.870 --> 04:25.931
there is a rest stop up ahead.
You're okay.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.730
Maybe when there's pee all over the
back seat, maybe then you'll believe me.

04:28.765 --> 04:32.389
Uh, okay. Julie, wait.
No, don't... don't... don't do that.

04:32.424 --> 04:34.355
Not, not in the car.

04:34.390 --> 04:38.166
I will give you $10 to hold it in.

04:38.201 --> 04:41.207
Really? - What are you doing?
You can't pay a person not to pee.

04:41.242 --> 04:43.593
- Best money I ever spent.
- Oh, sure he can.

04:43.628 --> 04:47.246
It's called "the free market."
I learned about it in school.

04:47.281 --> 04:51.335
So, Mr. Monk, how much would
you pay me not to throw up?

04:54.907 --> 04:57.220
Oh, my gosh!
Did you see that guy?

04:57.255 --> 05:00.601
- I'm gonna report him.
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:00.636 --> 05:03.752
Mr. Monk, do not get involved.
You will always regret it.

05:03.787 --> 05:06.512
How am I gonna regret this?

05:08.251 --> 05:11.297
Hello. Yes, I would like to
report one of your drivers.

05:11.332 --> 05:13.325
We're heading north on the 101.

05:13.360 --> 05:18.316
His license plate is CPO 8852.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.973
The problem? He...
he's driving like a maniac.

05:21.008 --> 05:24.972
He's all over the road.
He's gonna kill somebody.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.426
Really?

05:27.461 --> 05:31.160
Well, thank you very much. Thank you.

05:32.084 --> 05:34.722
He said that driver's done this before,

05:34.757 --> 05:38.945
and they're taking disciplinary measures.

06:44.116 --> 06:46.516
- Here.
- What's this?

06:46.551 --> 06:48.938
I'm returning your money.
I can't hold it in.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.545
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Julie, okay, look,

06:51.580 --> 06:54.892
just think about something else.
Let's play a game.

06:54.927 --> 06:56.677
Uh, let's play the numbers game.

06:56.712 --> 06:58.737
- How do you play?
- Oh, it's fun.

06:58.772 --> 06:59.966
I'll say a number.

07:00.001 --> 07:03.297
Then you... you say
a completely different number.

07:03.332 --> 07:06.135
And then we just keep
going until you never pee.

07:06.170 --> 07:07.807
Ready? 72.

07:07.842 --> 07:10.110
Hey, hey, you know what I used to play?

07:10.145 --> 07:12.910
I used to try to make
the truckers honk their horns.

07:12.945 --> 07:15.075
Watch this.

07:27.278 --> 07:30.740
- What a jerk.
- Would you like me to report him?

07:30.775 --> 07:33.125
No, no, no.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.929
Who cares if the sidelines
are perfectly straight?

09:24.964 --> 09:27.600
It was not a rectangle.
That's not fair to the children.

09:27.635 --> 09:31.129
Mr. Monk, you are the only
person in North America...

09:31.164 --> 09:34.250
- Oh, my God!
- Look out. Look out!

09:36.010 --> 09:40.313
Oh, my God. Ugh.

09:40.348 --> 09:42.178
Is everybody okay? Julie?

09:42.213 --> 09:44.804
- I think so.
- Oh, my God.

09:44.839 --> 09:46.484
- What is it? What is it?
- Oh, no.

09:46.519 --> 09:49.407
Mr. Monk, what is it?

09:49.442 --> 09:51.191
The pen in my pocket. It broke.

09:51.226 --> 09:54.273
Huh, leaked all over. See?

09:54.308 --> 09:56.139
Look.

09:56.174 --> 09:58.000
I think you're going to live.

10:00.571 --> 10:03.271
- What do you think happened?
- Uh...

10:03.306 --> 10:05.232
The ink cartridge
got snapped by the seatbelt.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.527
- I mean, up ahead.
- I don't know.

10:07.562 --> 10:12.042
- Mr. Monk, why don't you check it out?
- I can't go like this, can I?

10:12.077 --> 10:15.162
I picked up your laundry this morning.
It's in the back.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.933
I hope it didn't get
wrinkled in the accident.

10:33.742 --> 10:36.539
- Hello?
- Steven?

10:36.574 --> 10:39.521
- No. You got the wrong number.
- I don't think so. It's on my speed dial.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.709
I call it every day.

11:04.184 --> 11:06.010
Damn it.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.575
Pass it on.
Party in our car in 10 minutes.

11:27.610 --> 11:30.300
Okay, but you might've
to start without me.

11:31.174 --> 11:34.312
There's going to be a party in that
turquoise 1964 Mercury

11:34.347 --> 11:35.613
Comet convertible in 10 minutes.
Pass it on.

11:46.585 --> 11:49.425
- Do you know what happened?
- No, I was going to take a look.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.230
I'll come with you.
They might need some help.

11:51.265 --> 11:52.577
- You're a doctor?
- Wouldn't that be great?

11:52.612 --> 11:54.326
I should've been a doctor.
My brother's a doctor.

11:54.361 --> 11:55.825
That's the life.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.483
I'm a lawyer.
At least, for now.

11:57.518 --> 11:59.931
This time next year,
I'll probably be selling real estate.

11:59.966 --> 12:01.776
If I'm lucky. Which I'm not.

12:01.811 --> 12:04.811
- That's the spirit.
- Ha.

12:04.846 --> 12:08.306
- Garrett Price.
- Monk. Adrian Monk.

12:08.341 --> 12:09.949
Nice to meet you, Adrian.
You know what? Take the rest.

12:09.984 --> 12:11.301
I don't need 'em.

12:11.336 --> 12:13.734
Use them to pick your teeth.

12:22.953 --> 12:27.140
Man, what a mess. Oh, my God.

12:27.175 --> 12:29.921
Officer, how fast was he going?

12:29.956 --> 12:33.163
Too fast. About 80 miles an hour.

12:33.198 --> 12:34.365
He never passed me.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.065
How's that?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.030
This car. He never passed me.

12:38.065 --> 12:40.554
If he was going that fast,
I would've seen him.

12:40.589 --> 12:45.238
You probably missed him. You can't
remember every car on the highway.

12:45.273 --> 12:47.246
Can you?

12:47.281 --> 12:52.031
Skid marks all up and down,
but none near this vehicle.

12:52.488 --> 12:54.092
He didn't put on his brakes.

12:54.127 --> 12:56.243
I think you're right.
Wow, you could be a cop.

12:56.278 --> 13:00.252
I am. At least, I used to be.

13:00.287 --> 13:02.564
Then we have something in common.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.728
Two guys who used to be something.

13:13.599 --> 13:15.398
The car's in neutral.

13:15.433 --> 13:19.160
Well, maybe the gear thing
slipped in the collision.

13:19.195 --> 13:22.118
Maybe.

13:22.153 --> 13:25.360
The air conditioning is off.
So is the fan.

13:25.395 --> 13:31.172
- Okay, what does that mean?
- Both the windows, they're shut.

13:31.207 --> 13:35.180
Must be 90 degrees out here.
I couldn't drive like that, could you?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.294
You're absolutely right.
Can I ask you something?

13:37.329 --> 13:39.219
Why aren't you on the force?

13:39.254 --> 13:41.122
Uh, something happened.

13:41.157 --> 13:43.511
Was it a wrongful termination?
I could help you out with that.

13:43.546 --> 13:45.369
I mean I used to be pretty good.
I was as good as you.

13:45.404 --> 13:47.565
Excuse me. Gentlemen,
you're not allowed back here.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.164
- It's all right. He's a cop.
- Uh...

13:49.199 --> 13:52.342
I'm not technically
a cop anymore, technically.

13:52.377 --> 13:55.249
- If you want to be technical.
- Yes, I do. I want to be technical.

13:55.284 --> 13:56.426
Now, let's move it.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.164
But, Sergeant,
there is something wrong here.

13:59.199 --> 14:01.219
You're absolutely right, sir.
And it's you.

14:01.254 --> 14:03.180
Ahem, excuse me, General,
but I think you need to listen to him

14:03.215 --> 14:06.027
because he's brilliant and
he happens to be noticing things

14:06.062 --> 14:10.611
- that maybe some people aren't.
- Okay, sirs, I will not ask you again.

14:10.646 --> 14:15.455
I need you both to go back to your
vehicles. Step away from this accident!

14:15.490 --> 14:18.191
Man, where did that come from?

14:19.688 --> 14:22.833
This was no accident.

14:59.793 --> 15:02.064
- Adrian.
- Garrett.

15:02.099 --> 15:04.048
Garrett, you see this blood?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.808
Great. You can't have too much blood.

15:05.843 --> 15:09.664
But look at this smudge.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.499
It's on the outside.

15:16.534 --> 15:18.962
How did it get on the outside?

15:18.997 --> 15:21.074
Maybe it just tried very hard.
I really don't know.

15:21.109 --> 15:22.444
Listen, can I get my cards back from you?

15:22.479 --> 15:25.624
I wanna pass them out to these people.
I mean they've all been hurt.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.500
I'm a lawyer, right?
You got a dead guy. This is great.

15:28.535 --> 15:31.464
We're on the comeback trail.

15:34.487 --> 15:38.916
- You're not still here, are you?
- No. Yes. Yes, Sergeant,

15:38.951 --> 15:40.987
I'm telling you, there's something
wrong with this crime scene.

15:41.022 --> 15:42.691
It's an accident scene, sir.

15:42.726 --> 15:45.911
But he never slowed down.
There are no skid marks.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.882
Well, perhaps he fell asleep
or he had a heart attack.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.898
- It happens all the time.
- Sergeant, this guy,

15:50.933 --> 15:52.789
who was he?
What did he do?

15:52.824 --> 15:55.343
He worked for a nonprofit
environmental group.

15:55.378 --> 15:56.656
He was some sort of activist.

15:56.691 --> 15:58.620
Of course. Do you know
what he was working on?

15:58.655 --> 16:00.391
- You used to be a cop, right?
- Right.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.296
All right. Then maybe
you can appreciate this.

16:02.331 --> 16:04.750
I will tell you what
I do know about the victim.

16:04.785 --> 16:08.055
His name was Steve Marriot.
He died in a tragic single car accident.

16:08.090 --> 16:10.570
There is no doubt about that.
We have an eyewitness.

16:10.605 --> 16:12.882
The driver of that truck
saw the whole thing.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.652
The victim's car was
spinning out of control.

16:14.687 --> 16:17.295
It was traveling at 80,
85 miles per hour.

16:17.330 --> 16:20.420
There was nobody else in the vehicle.
There was nobody else near the vehicle.

16:20.455 --> 16:23.644
Nobody else ran from the vehicle. Okay?

16:23.679 --> 16:28.648
- But Sergeant...
- Look, Detective, or whatever you are,

16:28.683 --> 16:31.487
I've been very patient with you, sir.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.855
You have to let this go.

16:40.141 --> 16:42.517
Mr. Monk, Mom says you'll
help me find a bathroom.

16:42.552 --> 16:44.991
Oh, Julie, look, look, look.

16:45.026 --> 16:46.587
We're almost...
We're almost moving.

16:46.622 --> 16:48.952
Any... any... any minute now.
So, can't you please...

16:48.987 --> 16:51.073
Can't you hold it in?

17:01.242 --> 17:02.979
Excuse me, could you
spare some of that ice?

17:03.014 --> 17:07.127
- Sure, you want a beer?
- No, thanks.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.007
Hey... hey, guys, listen up.

17:16.041 --> 17:18.298
Nobody gets near that vehicle
unless they're on the job.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.722
Do you understand?
Let's lock this down.

17:20.757 --> 17:24.256
This is an accident scene.
Get that barrier in here.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.417
Get these people behind the barrier.

17:30.682 --> 17:31.986
Come on, come on,
folks, please, please.

17:32.021 --> 17:34.229
Step this way. Step lively.

17:39.899 --> 17:41.456
Hey, there you are.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.460
And my parents wanted me to take French.

17:43.495 --> 17:44.847
- What's up?
- This is Garrett Price.

17:44.882 --> 17:47.586
- Used to be a lawyer.
- I am a lawyer. Excuse me.

17:47.621 --> 17:49.727
I'm a lawyer again because
I'm reborn, my friend,

17:49.762 --> 17:51.543
because you're...you're a cop.

17:51.578 --> 17:54.029
Look, I got my inspiration from you.
You're a cop, it's in your blood.

17:54.064 --> 17:56.168
You can't turn it off.
It's who you are.

17:56.203 --> 17:57.111
Well, this is who I am.

17:57.146 --> 18:00.908
Hey, don't move until I get there
and he signs a release!

18:00.943 --> 18:03.098
This is unbelievable here.
I mean, I hit the mother lode.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.104
I got three cases of whiplash.

18:05.139 --> 18:08.737
One of them pregnant.
A pregnant woman with whiplash.

18:08.772 --> 18:11.869
Are you kidding me?
That's a summer home, right there.

18:11.904 --> 18:13.712
So, uh, how's your case going?

18:13.747 --> 18:16.444
It's...Still working on it.
Listen, I need to borrow your cell phone.

18:16.479 --> 18:18.616
Call my captain, maybe he can
help me out on this.

18:18.651 --> 18:22.042
It doesn't work. The goofy mountains
here. I can't get a signal myself.

18:22.077 --> 18:24.093
Ask one of these truck drivers.
They all got two-way radios.

18:24.128 --> 18:26.605
Excuse me, sir.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.961
Whoa!
Ma'am. Ma'am or sir.

18:28.996 --> 18:31.339
Mademoiselle. Uh, my friend here
is a big detective

18:31.374 --> 18:33.453
and he has a very important phone
call to make. Is there any way...

18:33.488 --> 18:36.403
- Damn it! Damn it to hell.
- Don't be afraid. Are you okay?

18:36.438 --> 18:39.152
No, I'm not okay.
I just got fired.

18:39.187 --> 18:40.052
Stay close.

18:40.087 --> 18:42.290
The owner just told me
some cretin called in

18:42.291 --> 18:44.688
complained about my
driving. Said I cut him off.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.742
Call came in just before the accident.
I'll bet he's still here.

18:47.777 --> 18:51.084
When I find out who did it,
his ass is mine!

18:51.119 --> 18:53.824
$10 says she's got an automatic.

18:53.859 --> 18:56.460
Owner played back the
tape of the phone call.

18:56.495 --> 18:59.031
Think I'd recognize his voice.

18:59.066 --> 19:03.320
- You're a detective, huh?
- Is he a detective? The biggest.

19:03.355 --> 19:06.247
Want to make a little money?
A little cash under the table?

19:06.282 --> 19:08.784
Help me find this guy.

19:08.819 --> 19:15.318
Well...Well, I would like to,
but I'm a little busy now.

19:16.733 --> 19:19.209
- You need a lozenge?
- It's probably all for the best.

19:19.244 --> 19:22.827
You don't want to be party to
what happens when I find this guy.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.213
Excuse me, we don't know each other.

19:24.248 --> 19:26.729
But if you find him, don't hurt
him because that'd be wrong

19:26.764 --> 19:28.430
and violence never solves anything.

19:28.465 --> 19:31.905
But if you hurt him,
please give him one of these.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.607
Excuse me, are you Adrian Monk?

19:33.642 --> 19:36.419
- Well, if he's not, I am.
- Yes.

19:36.454 --> 19:39.178
Y-Your friend, Natalie,
she wants to talk to you.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.184
I think she's hurt.

19:41.219 --> 19:44.698
- Let's go.
- I'll come, too, to help.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.245
Excuse me,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.515
I was on my way back from
Harleysburg when I heard.

19:59.550 --> 20:01.517
Figured I'd swing by and see
if I could help out.

20:01.552 --> 20:03.151
It's appreciated.
Talk to the EMS captain.

20:03.186 --> 20:06.034
He's over there.
He'll tell you what we need.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.096
Hey, excuse me?
You got a minute?

20:10.131 --> 20:12.164
It's my wife. She got banged up pretty bad.

20:12.199 --> 20:14.475
She's four months pregnant.
She's scared to death.

20:14.510 --> 20:18.497
- Where is she?
- She's right back here. Thanks.

20:19.568 --> 20:24.282
- She... She's right back here.
- What's she doin' back here?

20:24.317 --> 20:26.980
Oh, they put her back here
to check her blood pressure.

20:27.015 --> 20:29.347
- Her blood pressure?
- Yeah.

20:42.801 --> 20:45.072
- Hey.
- Hey, are you okay?

20:45.107 --> 20:48.674
Yeah, I'm fine. I think I just
sprained it or somethin'.

20:48.709 --> 20:51.264
- Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?
- Miss Teeger.

20:51.299 --> 20:54.412
My name is Garrett Price.
I'm a personal injury attorney.

20:54.447 --> 20:56.540
What a surprise.

20:56.575 --> 20:58.768
Sarcasm is a very good sign with trauma.

20:58.803 --> 21:02.351
And I must say that any friend
of Adrian Monk's is a client of mine.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.978
The man is a magnificent detective
and one of my greatest personal heroes.

21:06.013 --> 21:08.676
- We just met.
- Modesty becomes the brave, Mr. Monk.

21:08.711 --> 21:11.090
You're my hero.
End of discussion.

21:11.125 --> 21:14.713
Let's take a look at that wrist.
Oh, that doesn't look too bad.

21:14.748 --> 21:17.786
That is a very serious injury.
I could tell from here.

21:17.821 --> 21:21.450
How about a couple of pictures?
Always helps in front of a jury.

21:21.485 --> 21:26.109
You see, my thinking on this is that
someone owes you a great deal of money.

21:26.144 --> 21:27.783
- Can you lick your lips for this one?
- Cute.

21:27.818 --> 21:30.650
I'm kidding. Isn't that sweet?
She doesn't know when I'm teasing.

21:30.685 --> 21:33.163
The money, by the way,
has nothing to do with medical expenses.

21:33.198 --> 21:34.595
That's going to be considerable.

21:34.630 --> 21:38.423
The main body, where you really
kill them, is with mental anguish.

21:38.458 --> 21:41.701
You know, Mr. Price, I wasn't aware
of any mental anguish until I met you.

21:41.736 --> 21:44.256
That's why I'm here, darling.
That's the point of the whole exercise.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.219
She's a nice girl,
but doesn't understand.

21:46.254 --> 21:48.489
That's a five-star bruise,
don't you understand that?

21:48.524 --> 21:50.758
This is gonna change your life,
and yours as well.

21:50.793 --> 21:54.215
In fact, I wish we had one of those
paramedics here to document it.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.073
You mean, to treat it?

21:55.108 --> 21:56.814
That's my point. You document it,
then you treat it.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.906
What, are we savages?
I'll be right back.

22:02.846 --> 22:05.236
So, what happened up there?

22:05.271 --> 22:08.283
- A guy was killed.
- Oh, my God.

22:08.318 --> 22:10.299
Mr. Monk says he was murdered.

22:10.334 --> 22:13.119
Of course he does.
You know, Mr. Monk,

22:13.154 --> 22:16.173
there'd be no crime in all of San Francisco
if you never left your house.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.975
I can't help it.
The man was murdered.

22:19.010 --> 22:21.902
- Sweetie, did you find a bathroom?
- No.

22:21.937 --> 22:25.129
Isn't she a trooper?

22:28.209 --> 22:31.148
You, you. Yeah, where are you going?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.320
Never mind that. I got a lady
who broke her wrist back there.

22:33.355 --> 22:35.080
I need you to check it out.

22:35.115 --> 22:37.877
Thanks, and I'm sorry
I called you "General."

22:37.912 --> 22:40.287
Come on.

22:46.442 --> 22:49.690
You know, I would have found
a doctor for you.

22:49.725 --> 22:52.405
Mr. Monk, you didn't even ask how I was.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.408
It didn't even occur to you.

22:54.443 --> 22:57.388
All you cared about was
the stupid ink stain on your shirt.

22:57.423 --> 22:59.719
I was busy. I was talking to the patrolman.

22:59.754 --> 23:03.390
I'm sure you were talking,
because I know you weren't listening.

23:03.425 --> 23:08.040
You never listen to anyone.
You're just lost in your own world.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.490
Mr. Monk, this is a very dangerous job.

23:14.525 --> 23:16.861
What if I am ever in real trouble?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.807
- Are you gonna be there for me?
- I'll be there.

23:18.842 --> 23:22.028
See, I don't believe you.
It's a two-way street, Mr. Monk.

23:22.063 --> 23:25.701
We have to look out for each other.

23:27.259 --> 23:30.155
I'll be there.

23:30.190 --> 23:32.831
How's our patient?
I found a medic.

23:32.866 --> 23:36.560
He didn't want to come,
but no one says no to Garrett Price.

23:37.467 --> 23:40.874
What seems to be the problem?

23:42.123 --> 23:44.384
- So, what happened here?
- The wrist is broken.

23:44.419 --> 23:46.980
No, shattered.
And there's nerve damage.

23:47.015 --> 23:49.799
It's heartbreaking. A young woman,
a mother cut down in the prime of life.

23:49.834 --> 23:52.335
This is all great stuff.
Anyway, excuse me.

23:52.370 --> 23:54.621
Make sure you get a
copy of his report, okay?

23:54.656 --> 23:57.256
Look at that face. I can't wait
to get you in front of a jury.

23:57.291 --> 24:00.674
You'll wear something nice, huh?
If I were 20 years younger,

24:00.709 --> 24:04.914
and a completely different guy...

24:04.949 --> 24:06.183
I... I really appreciate this.

24:06.218 --> 24:08.697
There must be other people
that need help more than me.

24:08.732 --> 24:14.413
Everybody's important, ma'am, but, uh,
well, let's take a quick look, huh?

24:18.532 --> 24:21.657
Must be tired. Workin' too hard.

24:23.559 --> 24:27.106
- You're in construction.
- Mmm?

24:27.141 --> 24:32.138
- Uh, your boots.
- Oh, yeah. It's my other job.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.900
There we are.

24:42.954 --> 24:45.441
Look into the light.

24:45.476 --> 24:47.895
Oh, there's no sign of concussion.

24:47.930 --> 24:50.518
I heard you talking before. You're a
detective or something? - Or something.

24:50.553 --> 24:54.149
- You don't think it was an accident?
- Mr. Monk doesn't believe in accidents.

24:54.184 --> 24:55.189
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah!

24:55.224 --> 24:56.431
- How about that?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:56.466 --> 24:58.524
Mmm.

24:58.559 --> 25:01.651
- What do you think?
- Well, I'm no expert,

25:01.686 --> 25:05.699
but the driver was alone in his car
doing 80 miles an hour, right?

25:05.734 --> 25:08.008
Sounds like an accident to me.

25:08.043 --> 25:10.257
I think you're wasting your time.

25:10.292 --> 25:12.588
You're not gonna take her pulse?

25:12.623 --> 25:15.204
I just did when I was holding her wrist.

25:15.239 --> 25:18.364
She's fine. It's not broken.

25:21.803 --> 25:23.582
EGG Calling

25:26.292 --> 25:29.088
Your phone. You...
you got a call coming there.

25:29.123 --> 25:30.714
Yeah, whoever it is,
they'll call back.

25:30.749 --> 25:32.985
Look, I gotta go.
They're waiting for me.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.090
So, uh, let's keep
plenty of ice on that, okay?

25:35.125 --> 25:37.420
And no tennis for at least two weeks.

25:37.455 --> 25:38.836
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.555
Stay here with her.
Take care of her, okay?

25:42.590 --> 25:45.591
- Nice meeting you both.
- Yeah.

25:45.626 --> 25:47.148
There's something wrong with that guy.

25:47.183 --> 25:50.155
What, he was empathetic?
He cared about other people?

25:50.190 --> 25:54.252
Hey, I found some ice.
Hey, guess who's here.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.026
- Who?
- Korn.

25:56.061 --> 25:59.288
- What's Korn?
- They're a band.

25:59.323 --> 26:02.151
They're famous.
That's their tour bus over there.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.135
Oh, do you still have to go?

26:04.170 --> 26:06.892
I'm sure the tour bus has a bathroom.
Maybe Mr. Monk will take you.

26:06.927 --> 26:09.782
- I don't really think...
- Maybe Mr. Monk will take you now.

26:09.817 --> 26:11.684
Now. Right now.

26:11.719 --> 26:13.850
I'll take her. Right now.

26:30.338 --> 26:33.152
"Korn." They spelled it wrong.

26:33.187 --> 26:36.077
Shh, don't say anything.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.901
Sorry, sorry to interrupt.

26:39.936 --> 26:43.080
You have a great sound.
Very, very musical.

26:43.115 --> 26:45.919
I wish I could understand
more of the words.

26:45.954 --> 26:47.801
Do you...
Do you have a ladies room?

26:47.836 --> 26:50.681
This is Julie, and, uh,
it's kind of an emergency.

26:50.716 --> 26:51.791
Yeah, we have a bathroom.

26:51.826 --> 26:55.521
Our bus driver, Detox,
is in there right now.

26:55.556 --> 26:59.791
Okay, great.
We'll just wait for Detox.

26:59.826 --> 27:03.356
Easy now. Easy.

27:11.691 --> 27:13.638
I play the clarinet.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.352
I played with Willie,
you know, Nelson.

27:16.387 --> 27:22.235
I played with Willie Nelson.
And now I'm just waiting for Detox.

27:27.723 --> 27:29.498
I love your socks.

27:30.098 --> 27:32.155
They're not socks.

27:40.132 --> 27:42.839
It's all yours.

27:54.115 --> 27:55.488
So, you know what's goin' on out there?

27:55.523 --> 27:58.421
Uh, big car crash.
Driver was killed.

27:58.456 --> 27:59.757
Oh, that sucks.

27:59.792 --> 28:02.701
Maybe we should find out his name
and dedicate a song to him.

28:02.736 --> 28:04.878
No, I can tell you his name.
Steven Marriot.

28:04.913 --> 28:08.314
- Steven Marriot the activist?
- Wait, you guys know him?

28:08.349 --> 28:11.801
Yeah, man, I think we did like this, uh,
benefit gig a while ago, remember?

28:11.836 --> 28:15.474
Uh, it was the
Environmental Guerilla Group.

28:15.509 --> 28:18.391
Environmental...

28:19.195 --> 28:22.052
Environmental group.

28:23.813 --> 28:25.167
You got a call coming there.

28:25.202 --> 28:27.316
Whoever it is,
they'll call back.

28:27.351 --> 28:31.910
- EGG?
- EGG. EGG, yeah.

28:31.945 --> 28:35.430
Julie. Hey. Hey, hurry up.

28:35.465 --> 28:38.922
- Come on. We're... we're going.
- I haven't started yet.

28:38.957 --> 28:42.578
Come on, Julie. Let's go.

28:43.788 --> 28:47.741
Mom was right, you don't
care about anybody else.

28:47.776 --> 28:50.611
Julie, go back to your mom.
Tell her I was right about the paramedic.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.479
She'll know what I mean.

28:52.514 --> 28:55.398
Mr. Monk, she never knows what you mean.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.153
Nobody does.

29:00.808 --> 29:03.730
Hey, Mr. M.
Looks like the party's over.

29:03.765 --> 29:05.743
They brought in some cranes.
We'll all be going home soon.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.518
Garrett, where did you find that paramedic?

29:08.553 --> 29:11.720
At the crash site. Why? - Have you seen
him? Do you know where he is now?

29:11.755 --> 29:13.458
Not a clue. What's going on?

29:13.493 --> 29:17.429
I think he might be involved,
somehow, in all of this.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.064
What did you say?

29:21.252 --> 29:24.683
It's you. You son of a bitch!
You cost me my job.

29:24.718 --> 29:26.180
You cut us off.
That's not right.

29:26.215 --> 29:28.016
- You're a dead man!
- Wait a second, wait a minute.

29:28.051 --> 29:30.152
Look, it wasn't my fault.
I mean, it was my fault.

29:30.187 --> 29:32.199
But I never thought
they would fire anybody.

29:32.234 --> 29:34.769
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

29:34.804 --> 29:35.677
- Let her hit you.
- What?

29:35.712 --> 29:37.915
One shot, we got witnesses.
Try and take it to the nose.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.276
- Bleeds like a fountain.
- Garret. - You'll be fine.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.055
I needed that job.
Do you understand?

29:43.090 --> 29:46.550
Oh, look, I'm sorry.
I am really, really sorry.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.629
- If there's anything I can do...
- Maybe there is.

29:48.664 --> 29:53.725
All right. Okay. You're gonna call
my supervisor and get my job back.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.803
- Mary Jane.
- Yeah.

29:54.838 --> 29:57.029
It's Krystal.
Is Danny still there?

29:57.064 --> 29:59.562
There's somebody here
that wants to talk to him.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.587
Click and talk.

30:05.216 --> 30:07.728
- What do I say?
- Think of something.

30:07.763 --> 30:10.713
This is Daniel.
Who the hell is this?

30:10.748 --> 30:14.344
Hello. How are you? 10-4.

30:14.379 --> 30:18.906
This is the guy who called earlier
to complain about Krystal.

30:18.941 --> 30:22.113
Yeah, yeah,
I recognize your voice.

30:22.148 --> 30:25.461
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to withdraw that complaint.

30:25.496 --> 30:28.829
Why?

30:28.864 --> 30:32.829
Well...I was trying to get her fired,

30:32.864 --> 30:37.732
because I was mad at her
because...

30:40.264 --> 30:43.036
I wouldn't marry you.

30:44.962 --> 30:46.824
She wouldn't marry me.

30:46.859 --> 30:49.760
Who? Krystal?
You can't be serious.

30:49.795 --> 30:50.994
I love her.

30:51.029 --> 30:54.618
- Ha!
- I love everything about her.

30:54.653 --> 30:59.960
I love how she drives,
which is exemplary.

30:59.995 --> 31:03.102
And her smile.

31:03.137 --> 31:07.076
And the way she controls her rage.

31:07.111 --> 31:10.177
No, wait, don't leave.
No, come on, she still might hit him.

31:10.212 --> 31:13.594
If you're withdrawing the complaint,
there's nothing I can do.

31:13.629 --> 31:16.605
Tell Krystal,
"Get back to work."

31:16.640 --> 31:18.876
Are we finished?
There is something I have to do.

31:18.911 --> 31:23.415
Go ahead. But stay off the phone.

31:28.658 --> 31:31.191
Excuse me.

31:31.226 --> 31:33.194
Can I see some ID?

31:33.229 --> 31:37.186
You're talkin' to me? - Yes, I am.
Do you have any identification?

31:37.221 --> 31:39.189
Not on me, no.

31:39.224 --> 31:42.476
I don't think you're a paramedic.

31:42.511 --> 31:44.701
I don't think you're a cop.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.801
What's your name?

31:47.836 --> 31:49.516
- Excuse me.
- You killed him, didn't you?

31:49.551 --> 31:50.579
What the hell is going on here?

31:50.614 --> 31:52.527
I thought I asked you to return
to your vehicle, Mr. Monk.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.838
Sergeant, you've got
to stop this tow truck.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.398
- I gotta what?
- Listen to me,

31:56.433 --> 31:59.085
you cannot move this car.
You'd be destroying evidence.

31:59.120 --> 32:03.058
That'd be a big mistake.
And this man is not a paramedic.

32:03.093 --> 32:06.062
- I am not going to ask you again.
- I can't let you move this car!

32:06.097 --> 32:07.976
Stop him! All right, that's it.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.341
I warned you. Get him down.

32:10.376 --> 32:12.783
Give me those keys.
Give me those keys.

32:12.818 --> 32:15.016
Hands behind your back.
Hold the keys.

32:15.051 --> 32:20.278
You gotta listen to me.
This was no accident, sir.

32:32.746 --> 32:35.142
- Hello, boss.
- Oh, Natalie.

32:35.177 --> 32:38.682
And the next time we go someplace,
I think we should leave a little early.

32:38.717 --> 32:40.819
You know, to factor in traffic problems,

32:40.820 --> 32:43.342
homicide investigations,
you getting arrested.

32:43.377 --> 32:45.967
That's funny.
That's very, very funny.

32:46.002 --> 32:48.546
Listen, uh...Oh, by the way,

32:48.581 --> 32:51.102
how is your, um...
What is it? Your wrist, is it?

32:51.137 --> 32:54.562
Forget about it, Mr. Monk.
It's never gonna be a two-way street.

32:54.597 --> 32:57.494
I'll just have to accept that.
So what is going on?

32:57.529 --> 33:00.072
- You see that dump truck over there?
- Yeah.

33:00.107 --> 33:02.156
That's the one that passed us
on the highway.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.426
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, he wouldn't honk his horn.

33:04.461 --> 33:07.355
- He must not be a very happy person.
- The guy who was killed.

33:07.390 --> 33:09.939
- Steve Marriot.
- Marriot, right.

33:09.974 --> 33:11.476
I think he was already dead.

33:11.511 --> 33:15.289
There's no other explanation.
Because his car never passed us.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.453
I think it was inside that dump truck.

33:18.488 --> 33:21.171
And then it got dumped out
in the middle of the highway.

33:21.206 --> 33:22.618
- By who?
- By him.

33:22.653 --> 33:25.324
- The paramedic who was treating you.
- What?

33:25.359 --> 33:29.105
He's got mud on his boots that matches
the mud on the tires of the Volkswagen.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.480
He's the guy.

33:30.515 --> 33:32.888
- What's he doin'?
- He's looking for something.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.913
Remember the phone call he got?

33:34.948 --> 33:37.858
The caller ID read EGG.

33:37.893 --> 33:40.217
- EGG? What's that?
- Environmental Guerilla Group.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.823
That's the organization
that Marriot worked for.

33:43.858 --> 33:46.274
I think he's got Marriot's cell phone.

33:46.309 --> 33:49.680
Somehow they got mixed up.

33:49.715 --> 33:52.668
Now we gotta get you out of here.

33:52.703 --> 33:55.696
You know what?
If that Volkswagen was in the dump truck,

33:55.731 --> 33:59.047
there's gotta be some evidence in there.
Maybe some tire tracks or somethin'.

33:59.082 --> 34:00.561
You're right.

34:00.596 --> 34:02.247
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- No, no, no, no.

34:02.282 --> 34:04.537
You can't. You can't do that,
Natalie, it's too risky.

34:04.572 --> 34:07.052
Mr. Monk, when they dropped
that Volkswagen on the highway,

34:07.087 --> 34:10.364
it could have killed a lot of people.
It could have killed Julie.

34:10.399 --> 34:13.175
Don't worry,
I'm going to be okay.

34:13.210 --> 34:15.319
Nat...

34:37.172 --> 34:38.685
- Give you a hand?
- No. We're good.

34:38.719 --> 34:42.174
Just droppin' this guy at the morgue.

35:04.741 --> 35:06.215
Natalie!

35:08.748 --> 35:11.986
Somebody.
Officer, listen to me, sir.

35:19.891 --> 35:21.223
Help!

35:21.258 --> 35:23.086
Natalie.

35:26.656 --> 35:29.268
Natalie!

35:46.445 --> 35:48.330
Sir. Sir, please.

35:48.365 --> 35:51.196
Sergeant, listen to me.
You gotta listen to me.

35:51.231 --> 35:54.014
There's a woman in
the back of that dump truck.

35:55.263 --> 35:59.480
Sergeant, she's in danger.
You gotta believe me. Officer.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.429
Ugh.

36:05.085 --> 36:08.819
Sir. Sir, please. Sergeant.

36:08.854 --> 36:11.514
Officer. Hey, hey.

36:11.549 --> 36:15.330
Officer, just listen to me for one second.

36:27.656 --> 36:30.435
Son of a bitch.

36:32.172 --> 36:33.873
They're setting up
a roadblock 10 miles south.

36:33.908 --> 36:35.612
I heard him.
Is your seatbelt on?

36:35.647 --> 36:37.084
- Yes, it is.
- Nice and tight.

36:37.119 --> 36:38.760
Blinkers! Blinkers!

36:38.795 --> 36:40.644
Do you understand this is a car chase?

36:40.679 --> 36:43.634
Left lane ends 2 miles.
Left lane ends 2 miles.

36:45.985 --> 36:48.702
Help! Help!

36:48.737 --> 36:50.664
Up here. Help!

36:50.699 --> 36:53.994
Here, help! Look here, look!

36:54.029 --> 36:59.920
Help! Help! Help!

37:14.688 --> 37:17.058
Oh, my God.

37:19.877 --> 37:27.241
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

37:43.149 --> 37:45.557
Get alongside.
Can you get alongside?

37:45.592 --> 37:47.822
Got you.

38:46.019 --> 38:47.635
Be careful!

38:47.670 --> 38:50.067
Get closer!

39:35.093 --> 39:36.868
Show me both your hands!

39:36.903 --> 39:38.956
Step down out of the truck!

39:38.991 --> 39:41.528
Easy! Easy!

39:52.042 --> 39:55.166
Sir, I found this.

39:58.067 --> 40:01.445
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:06.257 --> 40:09.013
How's your wrist?

40:09.048 --> 40:13.347
Better. Thank you for asking.

40:13.382 --> 40:17.841
You unbuckled your seatbelt?

40:17.876 --> 40:20.133
Two-way street.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.306
Two-way street.

40:40.359 --> 40:43.015
I think you got it.

40:57.538 --> 41:00.696
Mr. Monk. Adrian.

41:00.731 --> 41:02.957
Adrian.

41:02.992 --> 41:04.515
Just like the movie.

41:04.550 --> 41:07.099
Listen, I wanted to thank you.
I needed to thank you.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.857
This has seriously been
the best day of my life.

41:08.892 --> 41:10.680
And I don't respect
a lot of people by the way.

41:10.715 --> 41:13.212
And I know you don't like to hug, so...

41:13.975 --> 41:17.046
I'm back, pal.

41:17.081 --> 41:19.721
Nice meeting you.

41:21.276 --> 41:23.661
There you are.
Do you feel better?

41:23.696 --> 41:24.615
A lot better.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.357
Good. What took you so long?

41:26.392 --> 41:29.195
Um, well, I got a tattoo.

41:29.230 --> 41:30.810
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

41:30.845 --> 41:32.348
Mom, it's okay. It's fake.

41:32.383 --> 41:34.818
Oh, that's very funny.

41:34.853 --> 41:36.883
Well, let's go.
We'll laugh in the car.

41:36.918 --> 41:39.728
- Come on, here we go.
- It's not rubbing off.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.612
Hey, there's a special rate for buses.

41:41.647 --> 41:43.211
Remember, you can't win if you don't try.

41:43.246 --> 41:45.785
Call me. Attaboy, all right.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.423
Hey, buddy.
Did you get a card?

41:48.458 --> 41:52.097
All right. Whoo. Nice car.
