WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:10.093
[Barbara] I'm worried about Alex Trebek.
He looks too skinny.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.512
[Marty] Barbara, shush!
You made me miss the question.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.098
[Barbara]  Jeopardy!  doesn't give
questions, Marty, they give answers.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.809
[Marty] All right, who is "you know
what the hell I meant"?

00:19.310 --> 00:21.730
[soft music plays]

00:24.607 --> 00:26.693
-Thank you, sir.
-You are welcome, sir.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.322
Oh, a virgin sock? Ooh-la-la.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.284
Yes, the elastic on it stretched, so...

00:34.367 --> 00:37.037
-It's not a foot sock anymore.
-Indeed.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.040
-I have the scriptures, Rabbi Glouberman.
-Thank you.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.339
Printing out a picture
of your dad's associate Susan

00:48.423 --> 00:50.049
was a stroke of genius.

00:50.133 --> 00:54.054
-Who knew a kid could just join LinkedIn?
-Not I. Now pull your pud.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.639
First I must shield the eyes
of the innocent.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.391
You're a decent man.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.144
Yeah, get that special sauce.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.439
[inhales deeply] It begins.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.943
[Monster] There we go.
Visualize, focus.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.905
-[gasps]
-[Monster] Interesting. Yes!

01:12.864 --> 01:14.741
-Yes...
-[groans]

01:14.824 --> 01:17.202
Well, how about that?
Plump tomato did it this time.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.912
-Yes.
-You ever actually fuck a tomato?

01:18.995 --> 01:22.040
-It's like fucking a sneeze.
-You find a sneeze sexual?

01:22.123 --> 01:25.001
-Ooh, I find everything sexual.
-What about a chair?

01:25.084 --> 01:26.628
-Sit on it, brother.
-An airplane?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.254
Big dick flying through the sky.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.423
What about a button-down shirt?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.383
You mean a gaping butthole and ten clits?

01:32.467 --> 01:33.301
What?

02:09.087 --> 02:11.506
Ugh. This thing's like an Ace bandage.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.424
It looks like I sprained my tits.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.719
Guinea piglet, what are you doing
with that bra?

02:16.803 --> 02:19.722
-It's the only one I have.
-Get rid!

02:19.806 --> 02:22.142
Do you ever have anything positive to say?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.602
-Ex-squash me?
-It's just you're such a bummer.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.814
All you do is make me sore
and hairy and bloated

02:27.897 --> 02:30.108
and, like, want to cry all the time.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.861
-Well, fuck you!
-Fuck you too!

02:32.944 --> 02:35.572
Honey, let's not do this
to each other, all right?

02:35.655 --> 02:39.492
We can have fun.
I can make you feel good.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.327
When have you ever made me feel good?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.955
Don't you remember the Jacuzzi jets?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.583
-You were there?
-I've always been there.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.752
Like when your mother
showed you  Dirty Dancin'.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.755
Oh, his hips,
they could do some things.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.550
Dirty things, and you liked it.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.137
Yeah. It was like a feeling
in my stomach, but deep down.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.471
That's just the beginning.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.349
There's a whole world of feelings
down there.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.020
Now, come here, baby.
Let's do the lift.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.897
-Really?
-Really.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.276
We are gonna have the time of our lives.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.531
How is writing a book report a skill
I'm ever gonna use in real life?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.074
When I'm an NBA point guard,

03:20.158 --> 03:22.368
it's not like I'll write a report
about how well I dunked.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.704
I'm doing mine on the current issue
of  Abraca-Daily.

03:24.787 --> 03:28.124
But Ms. Razz said that it had to be
on a work of historical fiction.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.377
Ms. Razz can suck my historical dick-tion.
[laughs]

03:31.461 --> 03:33.963
Nailed it. I already read this.
Why would I read something else?

03:34.047 --> 03:37.634
I don't mind reading so much.
My book's pretty cool. Ask me about it.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.387
"What's it about, Andrew?" It's about
an astronomer in the Middle Ages

03:41.471 --> 03:44.057
who discovers another planet,
and the church is mad.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.559
-So he has to go to the Vatican--
-Ooh, the Vatican?

03:46.643 --> 03:50.772
-Does he kill hookers?
-No, but he does perjure himself.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.273
[gasps]

03:52.357 --> 03:54.943
Oh, boy-oy-oy-oy...

03:55.026 --> 03:59.239
-Uh, you okay over there, Missy?
-This book is... [stammers]

03:59.322 --> 04:01.699
Really good!
It's called  The Rock of Gibraltar.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.035
It won the Gerson Prize
for historical fiction.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.704
You should read it, for Gustavo alone.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.622
[guitar strums]

04:07.705 --> 04:09.040
What's the book about?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.376
Ooh! Well...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.629
the book takes place
during the Moorish rule in Spain,

04:14.712 --> 04:17.465
so there's this knight,
Gustavo of Sevilla,

04:17.548 --> 04:19.801
who falls in love
with a Moorish princess, Fatima--

04:19.884 --> 04:22.887
-Well, it sounds--
-Gustavo's Catholic and she's Islamic,

04:22.971 --> 04:24.722
and their love is forbidden.
[groans]

04:24.806 --> 04:28.226
But then Gustavo needs to see her
because he loves her so much.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.020
-Yeah, no, I'm gonna get--
-He contacts the gypsy sorceror El Colon,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.731
who gives Gustavo the ability
to turn into a horse...

04:33.815 --> 04:35.566
-I got it.
-...just so he can visit Fatima,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.485
she meets him in the stables
and she rides him

04:37.568 --> 04:39.946
and he loves her so much
but they can never truly be together

04:40.029 --> 04:41.781
-because of their time--
-You really read the book.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.285
When Gustavo and Fatima are together
I feel like I'm sitting on a fountain

04:45.368 --> 04:47.829
-and there's fireworks in my stomach--
-Okay, okay!

04:48.538 --> 04:51.457
-Read that book.
-Yeah, I think I should.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.545
We're lucky men, Marty.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.089
To our magnificent boys Nicky and Andrew,

04:58.172 --> 05:00.258
what great friends
they found in each other.

05:00.341 --> 05:06.180
And to our wives, our beautiful,
surprising, sensual wives.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.640
[chuckles] Cheers!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.435
[both groaning]

05:10.518 --> 05:13.604
How many times is he gonna walk by
and not bring me more bread?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.065
-We still have some.
-What are you, on his side?

05:16.149 --> 05:19.402
-Marty, I'm not on the waiter's side.
-He's not a waiter!

05:19.485 --> 05:22.113
He's a busboy.
What are you promoting him for?

05:22.196 --> 05:24.324
Oh, this looks good.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.871
I think Elliot's waiting because
his wife's food hasn't arrived yet.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.581
Elliot could do what he wants.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.499
But I'm not letting my scallops
get ice-cold.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.500
Oh, well, God forbid.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.794
Cold scallops is how I got
food poisoning in West Palm, remember?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.464
-I remember.
-Then in Atlantic City, twice in Cape Cod

05:39.547 --> 05:42.425
-and then again in Atlantic City--
-I remember. You shit the bed.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.801
I'm referring to that!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.678
Maybe you should stop
eating scallops, Marty.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.806
And let the scallops win?
Ha! They'd love that.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.976
So, I know you weren't interested
in book club,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.562
but we read
the most amazing book this month.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.023
It won the Gerson Prize
for historical fiction.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.067
Oh, I'm not a history buff.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.402
No, listen, you will like this.

06:01.486 --> 06:05.948
It's a love story
between Fatima and Gustavo.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.575
[guitar strums]

06:07.658 --> 06:10.912
Trust me, it's very... compelling.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.747
You're winking. It is it not compelling?

06:12.830 --> 06:15.583
It's a sexy book, Barbara.
Just take the sexy book.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.418
-You'll like it.
-All right.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.753
"The Rock of Gibraltar"?

06:18.836 --> 06:21.339
Did Diane tell you we read it together?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.967
We like to incorporate reading
into our intimate time.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.930
Once all we had handy was a copy
of  If I Did It  by OJ Simpson.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.474
-Oh, God.
-And we definitely did it that night.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.851
Made love, not murdered
our estranged spouse.

06:33.935 --> 06:37.146
-And let's not forget Ron Goldman.
-Ron Goldman. Speaking of waiters,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.856
where the hell is that guy?

06:38.940 --> 06:41.025
Oh, these scallops.
Where's the men's room?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.777
-And we need more bread!
-Ugh.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.112
[bell ringing]

06:44.195 --> 06:46.030
[Jessi]  Fatima knew
if her father caught her

06:46.114 --> 06:47.740
running down to the stables at this hour

06:47.824 --> 06:51.035
he would forbid her
from studying at  la universidad.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.038
But was it her fault
that she craved a ride?

06:54.122 --> 06:56.332
Fatima, come to me.

06:56.415 --> 07:01.462
I am hungry for your touch
and for warm spiced oats.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.589
Wait, did you guys read through lunch?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.842
Wow. Uh, yes, we did.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.718
You must really like that book.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.596
Right now Fatima is trying
to track Gustavo's movements

07:10.680 --> 07:13.933
by following the stars, so she creates
a rudimentary astronomy lab.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.394
Oh, my God, have you read
Doubting Andreas ?

07:16.477 --> 07:18.521
He too creates a rudimentary
astronomy lab.

07:18.604 --> 07:23.025
Have you ever looked up at the stars
and thought, "The world is so big"?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.695
-"And I'm so small"?
-And yet so loud.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.322
This is the library.
Please go away, I am reading.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.574
Jesus. Okay.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.993
[Jay] Let's go see if that science teacher
is still crying.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.704
[Jessi]  Fatima looked down
at her intricately laced bodice,

07:34.787 --> 07:37.915
her sensual, ripe breasts
bursting from--

07:37.999 --> 07:39.417
[sighs]

07:40.084 --> 07:43.713
See what I mean?
That brassiere is U-G-L-Y.

07:43.796 --> 07:48.009
-It ain't got no alibi. It's--
-Dog shit, I know.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
Really?  The Rock of Gibraltar.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.639
Why is every girl I know
obsessed with this?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.517
Well, there is this incredible romance

07:56.601 --> 08:00.062
between Fatima and... Gustavo.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.523
So, what, do they kiss privates
or what's the deal?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.317
-Kiss privates?
-You know what I mean.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.361
Do they have sex?
No, Nicky, they can't. That's the point.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.156
-That's where the tension comes from.
-Of course, the tension.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.158
You have no idea why girls
read this book, do you?

08:12.241 --> 08:14.577
-Yeah, I do.
-Because it turns them on.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.499
-[stammers] What was that now?
-Newsflash: girls get horny too.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.461
-Don't tell me you didn't know that.
-Of course I did.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.297
Girls are just as horny as boys.
We just don't talk about it constantly.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.798
Hmm.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.344
Hey, Lia, I just remembered
I have a book report to write. Um...

08:31.427 --> 08:33.721
-Can I borrow  Rock of Gibraltar ?
-Fine.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.681
I don't know what you're up to,
you little perv,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.266
but I like the journey you're on.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.813
I still don't see what the rush is, honey.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.732
You've already got a perfectly nice bra.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.276
You tell Shannon you do not want nice.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.113
You want two scoops of Haagen-Dazs
French vanilla boobies.

08:51.197 --> 08:55.159
Mom, I want something... voluptuous.

08:55.243 --> 08:59.705
A woman's bosom should resemble
the wild, sweet oranges of Valencia

08:59.789 --> 09:01.249
which yearn to be plucked.

09:01.332 --> 09:05.253
Oh, honey, buying a fancy bra
won't make you look like these models.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.089
They all have their ribs removed
and their buttholes bleached.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.634
I get it. I just want a grownup bra, okay?

09:11.717 --> 09:14.220
This one! This is the one.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.265
Tell Shannon you'll kill yourself
if you don't get it.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.933
How about this one?

09:19.016 --> 09:22.019
I don't know, Jessi.
Is this bra really... you?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.146
Yes! Of course it's you!

09:24.230 --> 09:27.733
-It's always been you!
-Shh, shh. I got this.

09:27.817 --> 09:31.571
Was it not you, Mom,
who insisted from an early age

09:31.654 --> 09:35.741
that I quote, "embrace my power,"
end quote, as a female?

09:35.825 --> 09:38.661
Yes, but this red bra. [laughs]

09:38.744 --> 09:41.581
I mean, this is a power
that you can't handle yet.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.585
Are you trying to make me afraid
of my own sexuality?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.629
-[gasps] No, Jessi--
-Are you slut-shaming me?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
I would never slut-shame you.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.342
Are you the patriarchy?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.803
Oh, my God, of course not.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.054
Go in for the kill.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.599
Eleanor Roosevelt once said, quote,

09:59.682 --> 10:02.393
"Do one thing every day that scares you,"
closed quote,

10:02.476 --> 10:04.729
and I think this red bra
scares both of us.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.105
[sighs]

10:06.188 --> 10:09.233
-[both shouting]
-Oh, my God, we did it!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.986
-We got a bra, oh, my God!
-[laughs]

10:12.069 --> 10:13.529
You think you're excited.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.033
I just found out Dippin' Dots
isn't fluorescent guinea pig doodies.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.285
-It's ice cream.
-But you were eating it anyway?

10:19.368 --> 10:22.955
Yeah. Couldn't figure out
why these doodies were so delicious, so.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.957
What are you, bra shopping or what?

10:26.542 --> 10:29.128
Shark Tank  is making me nuts.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.922
I know that rotten kid stole my idea
for the illuminated toilet seat.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.507
-I'm reading.
-I never put it on paper,

10:33.591 --> 10:36.927
I never said it out loud, but somehow
he crawled into my brain

10:37.011 --> 10:39.263
and he stole my intellectual property.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.936
Oh, you mean take a look in it?

20:29.019 --> 20:32.231
Yeah, take a gander.
It's yours, isn't it?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.650
Uh, okay, sure.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.943
Can I get some privacy?

20:36.026 --> 20:38.195
Of course, pecorino.

20:38.278 --> 20:42.366
If you need me I'll be in the bubble bath
watching Dr. Drew Pinsky.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.618
He looks like a sexy turtle.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.038
[sighs] Here goes something.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.124
-Um... hello?
-Hey, girl, hey!

20:51.208 --> 20:54.002
Oh, my God, I have been dying to meet you.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.588
Oh, cool. Okay. Hi, I'm Jessi.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.548
Well, I'm your genitals.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.510
-[laughs] What's up?
-I was wondering when you'd---

21:01.593 --> 21:02.678
[both laugh]

21:02.761 --> 21:03.929
-I'm sorry, you go first.
-Wait!

21:04.012 --> 21:05.555
-Jinx!
-We just talked at the same time.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.516
-We're having fun.
-This is fun.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.269
I have to say, you are not
what I was expecting.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.437
-Do you want the grand tour?
-Uh, yes, please.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.814
Great. Okay.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.024
Well, up top, la-la-la-la,

21:16.108 --> 21:17.276
this is the clitoris.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.944
It is where the party happens.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.237
What do you mean by "party"?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.657
Oh, gosh. Have you ever been
electrocuted, but in a good way?

21:23.740 --> 21:26.618
-No.
-Okay. It's a very important spot.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.246
This is the urethra.
That's where the pee comes out.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.623
Oh. I didn't know there was a second hole.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.125
There's three, if you count your anus.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.711
-I don't think I do.
-Me neither. She's an asshole.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.712
[rim shot]

21:36.795 --> 21:38.130
-That's a joke.
-Oh, okay.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.007
She's a lovely lady, and a drummer.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.218
What else? Labia majora.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.304
-The labia minora.
-Oh, hi.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.223
And this part here is the actual vagina.
[pops]

21:48.307 --> 21:52.311
Oh. Weird. Sorry, I assumed
the vagina was like, the whole thing.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.687
A lot of people do that.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.189
It's like how people call
all sparkling wine champagne,

21:56.273 --> 21:59.735
but technically champagne is from
one specific region in France.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.571
[laughs] It's like, "Shut up, nerd,
we're just trying to get drunk!"

22:02.654 --> 22:03.655
[both laugh]

22:03.739 --> 22:05.365
-You know, you're not scary.
-Boo!

22:05.449 --> 22:06.533
-Ahh!
-[laughs]

22:06.616 --> 22:10.704
Of course I'm not scary.
I'm you, and I'm very fun.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.457
Wink-wink.
You know what I mean?

22:13.540 --> 22:16.126
Um, I mean, yeah, I guess
I think I know what you mean.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.338
-Oh, you know what I mean.
-I have some sense of what you mean.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.214
-I'm telling you to masturbate.
-Oh, okay.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.258
-All right.
-Okay, well, I'm gonna go now.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.969
-No. What? Stay forever.
-I wish I could.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.305
Aww. Don't be a stranger.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.642
-Neigh!
-Marty, what the...?

22:32.726 --> 22:34.478
I'm Gustavo the horse.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.689
-Why?
-I'm trying to romance you.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.608
Oh, of course you are.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.235
Look at you, you're Gustavo the horse.

22:42.319 --> 22:46.198
For the record, Marty, Gustavo
wasn't a man who dressed like a horse.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.992
Just get over here, all right?

22:49.076 --> 22:51.119
I threw away the scallops.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.206
Oh, you did? You threw 'em away, huh?

22:54.289 --> 22:55.665
-[kissing]
-[gasps]

22:55.749 --> 22:57.459
Oh, my God, girls get horny.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.170
-And your mom's a girl.
-So my mom gets horny too.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.547
-[Marty] Neigh.
-Jesus Christ,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.841
look at the size of your dad's balls.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.676
[birds chirping]

23:06.760 --> 23:09.096
Okay, and for our final book report,

23:09.179 --> 23:14.309
Nick Birch will be talking to us
about... Oh,  The Rock of Gibraltar.

23:14.392 --> 23:17.187
-Nick.
-Ms. Razz, bored students,

23:17.270 --> 23:21.525
The Rock of Gibraltar  is a brilliantly
told work of historical fiction.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.236
The story is beautiful
and filled with passion,

23:24.319 --> 23:27.364
but it's about so much more than just sex.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.450
In a way, it's about everything
around sex.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.453
-Does that make sense?
-It totally makes sense.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.707
See, Gustavo takes care of Fatima
without ever robbing her of her power.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.708
Mm-hm!

23:38.792 --> 23:41.002
Now, I'd like to perform
a dramatic reading

23:41.086 --> 23:45.090
of the speech Gustavo gives to Fatima
on the shores of Playa Paraíso.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.384
That is, of course,
if it's all right with the class.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.845
Do it now! Do the speech now!

23:49.928 --> 23:53.431
[clears throat]
Fatima, I worship you.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.685
I worship your brain
for all the brilliance it holds.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.437
I worship your beauty,
for it intoxicates me

23:59.521 --> 24:01.481
and drives me passionately to you.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.024
Señorita.
-Ooh!

24:03.108 --> 24:03.942
[Duke laughs]

24:04.025 --> 24:06.778
I worship your uncompromising free spirit.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.948
Know that I will never tame you,
unless that is what you wish.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.075
This one's slippery, be careful.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.120
Know that I could never uncover
all of your mysteries,

24:15.203 --> 24:17.372
even if I spent a lifetime trying.

24:17.455 --> 24:20.917
Mm-hm. There you go. That's it, baby.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.128
-Oh. Hello.
-[genitals] Hey, girl, what's up?

24:23.211 --> 24:26.506
But if you know nothing else,
Fatima, know this:

24:26.590 --> 24:30.427
I want you. I want you forevermore.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.137
I want you.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.639
Okay, thanks, that's it.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.142
Thank you, Gustavo-- Nick.
Thank you, Nick.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.059
Gracias.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.486
-El libro, señor.
-Thank you, sir.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.662
[groans]

24:57.746 --> 25:00.373
-Missy, huh?
-I guess so.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.168
I'm surprised your dad's
big ol' balls didn't show up.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.211
I hate you.

25:04.294 --> 25:08.173
Seriously, I was like, "Why is your dad
having sex with a messenger bag on?"

25:08.256 --> 25:11.676
And then I was like,
"Oh, those are his balls."

25:11.760 --> 25:13.428
I can't get 'em out of my mind.

25:13.511 --> 25:16.681
It's like, is he seeing a doctor
because there could be something wrong.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.434
It's weird, too, because they're veiny
but there's no hair.

25:19.517 --> 25:24.105
It's smooth. That's the weight, right,
pulling down the skin?

25:24.189 --> 25:27.442
I honestly wonder if he ever poops
on his own balls.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.611
He's probably got to drape 'em
outside the toilet.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.239
Maybe that's how he came up
with the illuminated toilet seat.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.700
I told some kid about that and he went
on  Shark Tank  and made millions.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.327
I feel like I should tell your dad,

25:37.410 --> 25:41.456
but I'm scared he'll hit me in the head
with that big pillowcase of watermelons.

25:41.539 --> 25:44.417
Ah, the boy is asleep. What a kid.

25:44.501 --> 25:48.213
What a set of nuts. Jesus Christ,
what a thing to live up to.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.048
And here's the thing with balls...
