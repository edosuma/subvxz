00:10.640 --> 00:12.380
( Engine roars )

00:12.480 --> 00:14.940
( All groaning )

00:15.040 --> 00:17.040
( Laughs )
Looks like the newbies

00:16.200 --> 00:17.780
can't handle lightspeed.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.260
Allow me to introduce you
to my compatriots.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.900
Toothpick Sally,
Recap Robot.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.020
Hello. Hi.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.220
And yours truly,
"Chance" Sureshot!

00:27.320 --> 00:28.700
( Whiffle! )

00:28.800 --> 00:29.420
Whoa!

00:29.520 --> 00:30.500
( Clank )

00:30.600 --> 00:33.480
( Smacks forehead )
Hm. We're here.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.920
All: Whoa!

00:37.200 --> 00:38.980
Chance Sureshot:
That's the Space Tree ââ

00:39.080 --> 00:40.860
Home.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.460
All: Whoa.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.680
Rigby:
Check out all the other domes!

00:56.440 --> 00:59.080
Colonel Rawls:
You left these new recruits
drifting for how long?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.940
Chance Sureshot:
Uh...maybe two days?

01:01.040 --> 01:01.860
Two days?!

01:01.960 --> 01:03.340
If you were on time,

01:03.440 --> 01:05.740
maybe they wouldn't have been
boarded by Reaperbots!

01:05.840 --> 01:07.780
Real rookie maneuver,
Sureshot.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.100
Now get down
and give me 300,

01:09.200 --> 01:10.780
you miserable
sack of space puke!

01:10.880 --> 01:11.820
Eh, Yes, sir!

01:11.920 --> 01:12.820
( Grunting )

01:12.920 --> 01:13.860
( Clears throat )

01:13.960 --> 01:15.500
As for the rest of you,

01:15.600 --> 01:16.820
welcome to space.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.100
I'm Colonel Rawls ââ
insert pleasantries here.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.260
Hi. Benson here.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.580
Quick question ââ

01:21.680 --> 01:22.980
what is going on?!

01:23.080 --> 01:24.860
Man:
<i>Congrats, new domers.</i>

01:24.960 --> 01:26.740
<i>You have been selected</i>
<i>to take part</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:28.840
<i>in the next frontier</i>
<i>in recreation.</i>

01:28.680 --> 01:30.940
<i>The Spark Initiative!</i>

01:31.040 --> 01:32.020
Spark...

01:32.120 --> 01:33.940
( Gasps )
Space park!
Shh!

01:34.040 --> 01:36.040
Man: <i>Our operatives on Earth</i>
<i>determined</i>

01:35.760 --> 01:38.180
you <i>would be a good fit</i>
<i>for this mission.</i>

01:38.280 --> 01:39.540
<i>Over the next few months,</i>

01:39.640 --> 01:41.500
<i>this space station</i>
<i>will be your home.</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:44.260
<i>You'll train with the best</i>
<i>from around the world.</i>

01:44.360 --> 01:46.340
<i>Then you'll be sent off</i>
<i>on your own</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:48.500
<i>to explore pristine</i>
<i>space wilderness.</i>

01:48.600 --> 01:50.980
<i>So that this</i>
<i>can become this!</i>

01:51.080 --> 01:53.180
<i>After that, you'll go to</i>
<i>the (beep) system</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:55.280
<i>where you'll protect (beep)</i>
<i>as you arrive at (beep).</i>

01:55.080 --> 01:57.380
( Laughs nervously )
Uh, that's classified for now.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.540
So, who's jazzed about this?

01:59.640 --> 02:01.780
( All cheering )

02:01.880 --> 02:04.220
I see one guy
who isn't jazzed.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.020
So, we're being
forced to do this?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.100
Well, this is purely
a volunteer mission

02:08.200 --> 02:09.140
to benefit mankind.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.240
Well, I <i>don'tvolunteer!</i>

02:13.920 --> 02:14.820
That's different.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.860
Why can't Benson see

02:15.960 --> 02:17.780
that this is gonna be
really cool?

02:17.880 --> 02:19.700
He's afraid
to try something new.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.060
The park wouldn't
be the same without him.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.160
Rigby:
We got to get him on board!

02:24.960 --> 02:26.960
And this
here's the barracks.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.620
Cool! Bunkbeds!

02:29.720 --> 02:31.180
Benson, check it out!

02:31.280 --> 02:33.460
Cool pillows.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.140
Those pillows
are not cool at all

02:35.240 --> 02:36.740
and neither is space.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.940
Actually, Benson,
I hate to disagree,

02:39.040 --> 02:41.700
but living in space
is the definition of cool.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.100
I mean, I just got goosebumps
saying that!

02:44.200 --> 02:46.780
Um, again,
basically kidnapped

02:46.880 --> 02:48.940
and forced to do this.
What's the matter,
Benson?

02:49.040 --> 02:51.040
You can have top bunk
if you want.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.500
( Sarcastically )
Ohâho, the top bunk!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.940
Now I definitely want to
stay in space.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.540
Muscleman,
what about Starla?

02:56.640 --> 02:58.060
Starla would be proud.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.080
Besides, I know our love
will stand the test of time.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.860
( Smooch )

03:03.960 --> 03:06.060
Well, Fives,
what about Celia?

03:06.160 --> 03:08.160
Ditto.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.020
I can't believe
you people!

03:10.120 --> 03:11.780
Those scientists
lied to us.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.220
Mr. Maellard lied to us!

03:13.320 --> 03:15.440
( Scoffs )
I want to go home.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.080
Skips: This is gonna be
harder than we thought.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.380
Thank you all for joining me
on this tour.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.700
If you look to your left,

03:24.800 --> 03:26.800
you'll find
the Jamaican domers

03:26.240 --> 03:27.780
doing a little
target practice.

03:27.880 --> 03:28.660
( Zap! )

03:28.760 --> 03:30.540
All: Whoa.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.460
Benson, did you see
how cool that was?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.540
Can you believe
we get to use these things?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.640
Yeah,
<i>that'snot a safety hazard.</i>

03:38.480 --> 03:40.480
( Both gasp, cough )

03:41.560 --> 03:43.220
And in the simulation room,

03:43.320 --> 03:44.940
we can program
any scenario

03:45.040 --> 03:47.340
to prepare you for what
you might encounter in space.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.700
That's pretty wild,
huh, Benson?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.940
Any scenario
you might encounter.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.580
Think of
the possibilities.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.580
The only scenario
I want to encounter

03:55.680 --> 03:57.420
is me going back
to my apartment.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.100
And finally, this is
the food court.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.700
Domers and pilots alike

04:02.800 --> 04:05.060
come here to hang out
and swap stories.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.100
Mordecai: Hey, Benson,
check it out!

04:07.200 --> 04:09.260
All you can eat wings!

04:09.360 --> 04:11.180
Yeah, they had that
back on Earth.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.280
And they're
probably better too.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.920
Here's your new jumpsuits.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
They got your names
on them.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.200
Pretty cool, right?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.580
No, not cool.
Harsh.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.300
You should keep this, anyway.
I'm not staying.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.340
( Scoffs )
You still don't get it?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.620
You don't think this mission
is important?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.500
Well, fine.
We don't need you!

04:30.600 --> 04:31.980
All that matters is

04:32.080 --> 04:34.100
that we have a team
that wants to be here!

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
This seems like
a pretty important mission.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.880
You don't want
to experience that?

04:37.160 --> 04:39.220
Come on, Benson,
just stay with us.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.980
I can't believe you are all
fine with this!

04:42.080 --> 04:44.380
( Scoffs ) I mean,
if this is a peaceful mission,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.340
why do we have to practice
using weapons?

04:46.440 --> 04:48.620
Why did I have to wear
that fax machine like a jerk

04:48.720 --> 04:51.060
if you didn't have anything
important for me to do?

04:51.160 --> 04:52.300
I had a good life,

04:52.400 --> 04:53.860
and then you
had to drag us up here!

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
No more questions!
That's an order!

04:55.440 --> 04:56.780
Why would I listen to you?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.300
I'm the Park Manager!

04:58.400 --> 04:59.820
Well, <i>I'mthe Colonel,</i>

04:59.920 --> 05:02.720
which is about 100 positions
higher than you!

05:04.040 --> 05:05.060
( Buzzer sounds )

05:05.160 --> 05:05.940
( Ding, Sizzle )

05:06.040 --> 05:06.820
( All gasp )

05:06.920 --> 05:07.740
Are you done?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.500
Oh, I'm done!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.140
I'm done
with all of this!

05:11.240 --> 05:12.540
Then go, then!

05:12.640 --> 05:14.640
We can get a pod back to Earth
for you, quitter!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.560
Sounds great, I'm out!

05:18.680 --> 05:20.060
Shoot.
I thought for sure

05:20.160 --> 05:22.160
that reverse psychology
was gonna work.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.980
Hey, man,
that was messed up.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.300
You can't do that
to our boss.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
You guys better get Benson
on board.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.900
I think
I've got one more idea

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
that can get him to stay.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.700
You can't be serious,
Benson.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.460
You're really gonna give up,
now?

05:35.560 --> 05:37.740
I've been telling you guys,
for the past two hours,

05:37.840 --> 05:39.300
you're not gonna
change my mind.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
As soon as I finish
this space panini,

05:41.080 --> 05:42.260
I'm out of here.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.300
( Chomps )

05:43.400 --> 05:45.140
There. I'm done.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.660
If you really
want to go,

05:46.760 --> 05:48.100
I guess
we can't stop you but...

05:48.200 --> 05:50.200
You should at least watch this
before you leave.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.540
We all
put this video together.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.560
We think it might change
your mind about staying.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.820
How did you make this?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.380
Don't you remember

05:56.480 --> 05:58.480
that really cool editing bay
we saw on the tour?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.820
There were so many VCRs!

05:59.920 --> 06:01.740
( Sighs )
I know what this is.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.980
It's a tape full of
sappy memories

06:04.080 --> 06:06.300
that are supposed to
convince me to stay,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.140
show me where I belong.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.140
Well, it won't work!

06:10.240 --> 06:11.260
No, Benson, wait!

06:11.360 --> 06:13.500
You're making a mistake!

06:21.560 --> 06:22.820
( Coughing )

06:22.920 --> 06:24.500
( All talking at once )
Man: Sir! Sir!

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
Are you responsible
for the park disappearing?

06:26.520 --> 06:27.620
No! I ââ

06:27.720 --> 06:29.720
How do you plan
to reimburse the city

06:29.360 --> 06:30.780
for all the damages?
What? Uh...

06:30.880 --> 06:32.880
Sir,
what is space food like?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.140
Do you take it orally
or ââ

06:33.240 --> 06:35.240
( All talking at once )
Get away from me!

06:39.480 --> 06:41.460
Why isn't my key working?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.580
Why, that apartment's
been vacant for 30 years!

06:44.680 --> 06:45.820
30 years?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.580
But I've only been gone
for two days!

06:47.680 --> 06:49.140
Sorry, did I say years?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.020
I meant hours ââ
30 hours.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.260
We all saw the news

06:52.360 --> 06:54.860
and assumed
you were in space for good!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
There's some fresh new
college students

06:56.320 --> 06:57.340
living in there.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.100
( All laughing, cheering )

07:00.200 --> 07:01.900
( Laughs )

07:02.000 --> 07:04.660
We just drew your face
on this dude's gut.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.820
Man:
Yeah, you look like a loser.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.780
( Sighs )

08:24.400 --> 08:25.980
<i>Hey, Benson.</i>

08:26.080 --> 08:28.060
<i>Um, we get why</i>
<i>you want to go back to Earth,</i>

08:28.160 --> 08:30.160
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>we were really up front about</i>

08:29.560 --> 08:31.560
<i>why we wanted you to stay.</i>

08:32.320 --> 08:35.140
<i>It just wouldn't be the same</i>
<i>without you.</i>

08:35.240 --> 08:37.240
<i>I won't be able</i>
<i>to keep up with work</i>

08:36.800 --> 08:38.800
<i>without you</i>
<i>breathing down my neck.</i>

08:38.520 --> 08:40.840
<i>And who am I gonna have</i>
<i>wing eating contests with, huh?</i>

08:40.920 --> 08:43.420
<i>I've always appreciated</i>
<i>your noânonsense attitude</i>

08:43.520 --> 08:46.880
<i>and dedication to your work.</i>
<i>It's really inspiring.</i>

08:47.520 --> 08:49.380
<i>Hey, Benson,</i>
<i>I don't know you very well,</i>

08:49.480 --> 08:51.420
<i>but I do know</i>
<i>you mean a lot to these guys.</i>

08:51.520 --> 08:53.780
<i>And I'd like a chance</i>
<i>to get to know you better, too.</i>

08:53.880 --> 08:55.880
<i>You do have the best chance</i>

08:55.240 --> 08:57.240
<i>of keeping Rigby</i>
<i>from blowing something up.</i>

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
<i>It's true! I already broke</i>
<i>the first camera</i>

08:58.920 --> 09:00.380
<i>we tried to record</i>
<i>this with.</i>

09:00.480 --> 09:02.900
<i>We all</i>
<i>really look up to you,</i>

09:03.000 --> 09:07.620
<i>but also, you're our friend,</i>
<i>and we'll miss you a lot and ââ</i>

09:07.720 --> 09:08.740
( <i>Crying)</i>

09:08.840 --> 09:10.840
( Crying )

09:12.400 --> 09:15.700
<i>All right, you get it,</i>
<i>we'll miss you, so...</i>

09:15.800 --> 09:17.180
<i>Don't go, all right?</i>

09:17.280 --> 09:19.320
<i>Yeah, Benson,</i>
<i>we can't do this without you.</i>

09:20.920 --> 09:22.500
I made a huge mistake.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.820
I should've stayed in space!

09:25.920 --> 09:29.260
( Screaming )

09:29.360 --> 09:30.860
Aah! I shouldn't have left!

09:30.960 --> 09:32.960
I shouldn't have left!
I shouldn't have left!

09:34.200 --> 09:35.340
( Panting )

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
Aah!

09:38.280 --> 09:39.300
Benson!
Are you okay?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.300
( Gasps )
You're all here!

09:41.400 --> 09:42.860
You're so young!

09:42.960 --> 09:44.540
( Both grunt )
So this is
what it's like

09:44.640 --> 09:46.100
on the other side.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.020
On the other side
of the door?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.700
What? No, I was on Earth.
For years.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.720
Eileen: Actually, you went
into the holoâsimulator.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.220
Well, it won't work.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.420
No, Benson, wait!

09:57.520 --> 09:58.620
You're making a mistake!

09:58.720 --> 10:01.320
I should've
stayed in space!

10:02.240 --> 10:04.700
Eileen: You just walked through
the wrong door.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.780
Oh.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.580
It seems like
a huge design flaw

10:07.680 --> 10:09.620
to have those rooms
next to each other.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.740
Man, life on Earth
without you guys

10:11.840 --> 10:13.260
was pretty terrible.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.360
So maybe I don't know
what's gonna happen

10:14.760 --> 10:16.760
or what everything means,

10:15.920 --> 10:17.620
but, as long as
we're together,

10:17.720 --> 10:19.420
that's enough for me.
You know, Benson,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.380
there may be
a lot of new stuff going on,

10:21.480 --> 10:22.460
but we're all the same.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.640
The park's still the park,
and you're still our boss.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.460
Thanks, everyone.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.060
( Door opens )
Colonel Rawls: Is he in?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.300
Sounds like he's in!

10:29.400 --> 10:31.100
Welcome to space,
everybody!

10:31.200 --> 10:33.540
All: Whooooa!
