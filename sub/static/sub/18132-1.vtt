00:44.412 --> 00:47.379
Little hands, little feet,

00:47.381 --> 00:51.683
sent from heaven,
perfectly sweet.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.824
They truly are angels.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.392
Angels.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.394
Oliver, you touch those blinds
one more time

01:02.396 --> 01:04.596
I swear I will murder you.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.632
Oh my god, where did
you get that?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.704
Libby, sweetheart, go play
with the other kids.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.640
No.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.076
Anyone else need a little
hair of the dog?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.579
No?

01:23.084 --> 01:24.349
You?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.287
No?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.789
Ugh, god.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.290
I had a crazy night last night.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.425
I remember when we had
crazy nights.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.862
You four party hopping
in Ruth's Malibu classic?

01:36.864 --> 01:39.164
I am so glad those days
are behind me.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.667
So silly.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.571
Are you kidding me?

01:45.573 --> 01:48.107
That is so cute!

01:48.109 --> 01:50.476
It's not even right
it's so cute.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.595
The cutest.

01:52.596 --> 01:54.757
Yeah, cutest Halloween costume
I've ever seen.

01:57.852 --> 02:01.253
<i>Ruth, it's not a Halloween</i>
<i>costume.</i>

02:01.255 --> 02:04.189
<i>I just thought because of</i>
<i>the bunny ears and tail.</i>

02:04.191 --> 02:07.526
No.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.495
I get it now, it's cute.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.197
It's sooooo cute.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.769
This one's from Ruth.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.372
Santa Clause.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.207
Very funny.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.517
Is it a toy?

02:31.519 --> 02:32.852
<i>What is it?</i>

02:32.853 --> 02:34.186
<i>Let me see!</i>

02:34.188 --> 02:36.288
<i>What is it?</i>

02:39.827 --> 02:41.460
What is it?

02:41.462 --> 02:43.195
It's a penis.

02:43.197 --> 02:48.200
Penis! Penis! Penis!

02:48.202 --> 02:49.535
Alright, alright!

02:49.537 --> 02:52.204
Penis! Penis! Penis!

02:52.206 --> 02:53.238
Yes!

02:53.240 --> 02:54.406
Give it back.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.575
Give it back, please, now, ok?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.450
It's a joke.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.453
A gag.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.222
Come on!

03:52.967 --> 03:54.733
Give me the bat, kid.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.902
I'll show you how it's done.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.338
This piñata is a piece of shit.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.609
Shan!

04:03.611 --> 04:07.846
I'm just helping the kids
with the piñata.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.848
Ok.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.483
You guys are in luck

04:11.485 --> 04:14.987
because my parents named me
after Babe Ruth.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.355
Who?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.374
Aaaagh!

04:39.380 --> 04:42.981
He's alright, I think he's just
more scared than anything.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.652
Oliver? How many
fingers am I holding up?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.754
Buddy?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.022
Should I get a Band-aid
or something?

04:50.024 --> 04:51.356
Get her away from me!

04:51.358 --> 04:53.859
Just go.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.561
<i>I know it hurts, it'll get</i>
<i>better though.</i>

04:56.563 --> 04:57.696
<i>It's gonna get better.</i>

04:57.698 --> 05:00.032
<i>It's ok, sweetie.</i>

05:02.503 --> 05:04.569
Sorry about that, little fella.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.576
<i>Ok, it's ok.</i>

05:11.578 --> 05:14.079
<i>It's ok, hold still.</i>

06:07.401 --> 06:09.801
¶ Finally, it's happened
to me ¶

06:09.803 --> 06:11.837
¶ right in front of my face ¶

06:11.839 --> 06:14.840
¶ and I just cannot hide it. ¶

06:14.842 --> 06:18.577
¶ Meeting Mr. Right,
the man of my dreams, ¶

06:18.579 --> 06:20.979
¶ the one who showed me
true love, ¶

06:20.981 --> 06:22.614
¶ or at least it seems. ¶

06:22.616 --> 06:26.518
¶ With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair, ¶

06:26.520 --> 06:28.453
¶ it's just the way
he looks at me, ¶

06:28.455 --> 06:30.889
¶ that gentle loving stare. ¶

06:30.891 --> 06:34.126
¶ Finally, you've come along, ¶

06:34.128 --> 06:38.563
¶ the way I feel about you just
can't be wrong. ¶

06:38.565 --> 06:40.866
¶ If you only knew the way ¶

06:40.868 --> 06:43.568
¶ I feel about you, ¶

06:43.570 --> 06:47.139
¶ I just can't describe it,
oh, no no-¶

06:48.709 --> 06:50.876
I'm up, dad!

06:56.483 --> 06:58.049
Dubster, it's Ruth.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.552
You, me, drinks tonight.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.687
Whaddya say?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.832
I'm like...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.133
five cents short.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.136
<i>Not my problem.</i>

07:18.138 --> 07:21.840
<i>Seriously? Seriously.</i>

07:21.842 --> 07:24.776
Five cents.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.751
That's cool, I'll walk.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.053
I need exercise.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.660
Time.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.128
57 seconds.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.680
Are you kidding me?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.231
It was 53 seconds, you pushed
the button down late.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.967
And I had organic baby artichoke
hearts in there, new code.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.253
Not bad.

07:51.254 --> 07:53.538
Pedro, stop breathing
on my back.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.940
I will kill you.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.175
Okie Dokie.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.577
Smoke break.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.212
Yeah, totally.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.714
Meet you guys out there
in a sec.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.926
Hey Ted, how's it going?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.828
Not too shabby.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.201
Crazy, you're a winner!

08:23.203 --> 08:24.903
I'm sorry, what?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.872
Lucky five double-o.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.773
It means your groceries
are free.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.976
Oh, I wish I had more.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.178
Pedro?

08:33.179 --> 08:33.945
Pedro?

08:33.947 --> 08:34.980
Si, señora.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.615
Take a picture with my phone.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.551
I want to have, like, a wall of
winners for the contest.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.053
Ok.

08:43.823 --> 08:44.689
You're gonna...

08:44.691 --> 08:47.559
alright.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.594
Ok, do the smile.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.868
Alright, I'm actually in a hurry
here so I'm gonna-

08:56.870 --> 08:58.737
Take another one.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.605
He didn't get the gift
certificate in the shot.

09:00.607 --> 09:01.773
Ok.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.011
Ok.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.915
Oh, shit.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.283
That's a 911, I gotta go.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.317
Wait, wait, wait!

09:12.319 --> 09:13.852
Your groceries.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.021
Oh, yeah, I should uh...

09:16.023 --> 09:17.756
thank you.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.627
Hey Ruth, you coming or what?

09:22.629 --> 09:23.645
Yeah.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.662
Hey, we should totally
hang tonight.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.298
Yeah, same time, same place?

09:26.300 --> 09:27.198
Yeah.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.701
Yeah.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.802
Did you bring a lighter?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.571
No.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.641
<i>Wooo!</i>

09:36.643 --> 09:37.976
<i>Yeah, Ruth.</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:41.713
Finally.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.014
That's a lot of stuff.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.016
Open the door!

09:46.853 --> 09:49.087
Oh my god.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.057
You're the bomb.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.759
Let's get wasted!

09:57.631 --> 09:59.831
This is some fresh shit.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.834
Liz always has the best stuff.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.769
We should so go back
to my place right now

10:04.771 --> 10:06.338
and watch Wayne's World.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.091
Wayne's World?

10:09.092 --> 10:11.843
Me and my friends can quote
the entire movie verbatim.

10:11.845 --> 10:15.146
Aaah, turn it off, turn it off!

10:15.148 --> 10:19.117
It's sucking my wig,
oh the humanity!

10:19.119 --> 10:21.753
Oh my god, I would
literally kill

10:21.755 --> 10:24.623
for sour cream and onion
chips right now.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.408
Oh yeah.

10:26.409 --> 10:28.192
I'll run to the store
and grab some.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.730
You have the keys to the store?

10:37.270 --> 10:37.770
¶¶¶

10:47.314 --> 10:47.814
¶¶¶

10:57.424 --> 10:57.924

One box extra large condoms,
cantaloupe, chips.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.865
Ok.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.153
Hello.

12:57.511 --> 13:01.546
That's the Stokke Exploree,
voted best stroller of 2014

13:01.548 --> 13:04.983
in Parenting Magazine.

13:04.985 --> 13:05.984
How much is it?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.119
$800.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.226
There you go.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.896
Um, do you have a washroom?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.464
Oh, yeah.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.232
It's just right around
the corner there.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.269
Oh, oh, oh!

13:26.840 --> 13:32.410
Oh no, oh you poor thing.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.913
I've been there before,
it's not fun.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.482
I know.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.817
Just go, quick.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.085
Before my boss gets back
from lunch.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.053
Ok?

13:42.055 --> 13:43.822
Go ahead.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.030
It's ok.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.505
Hey Shan, it's just me
calling again,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.974
just calling to see
how you're doing.

14:02.976 --> 14:07.979
Hmm, I'm thinking maybe your
phone is dead or something.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.848
We should get best
friend rings.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.233
You know what?

14:11.234 --> 14:12.617
Uh, I have something for you,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.919
I think I'm just gonna
drop it by later.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.462
Hey!

14:24.464 --> 14:26.631
It's your real baby
shower gift.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.566
It's an award winner.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.905
The Stokke Exploree.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.941
No, no I test drove this model,

14:36.943 --> 14:39.244
it's really sticky on
a three point turn.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.748
Oh.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.251
<i>Mom, Didi said I have to eat
a poo sandwich for dinner.</i>

14:46.253 --> 14:48.353
I better go deal with that.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.587
Mmmhmm.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.224
Oh, hey, do you want
to call Deb

14:53.226 --> 14:57.128
maybe grab a drink
at Tommy's later?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.530
We don't do that anymore, Ruth.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.967
<i>Mom, I don't want to eat poo.</i>

15:25.158 --> 15:26.991
Wake up, will ya?

15:26.993 --> 15:28.526
Come on, it's almost noon
for Christ's sake.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.061
Your sister's here already.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.579
Come on!

15:31.580 --> 15:33.096
You're supposed to go around
and knock on the front door.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.365
I'd get my sneakers wet.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.767
Get up.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.648
Get the stupid dog out of here!

15:41.541 --> 15:43.641
Check mate.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.444
Wow.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.980
Wow, that's good.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.381
You're getting good, girl.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.219
Hey, listen.

15:55.221 --> 15:58.222
You gotta do me a favour,
please try to clean up

15:58.224 --> 16:01.626
that cigarette garden of yours,
please, today.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.594
Wow, that's incredible.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.563
Someone in the world
still smokes?

16:05.565 --> 16:09.067
Way to show 'em, Ruth.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.470
I brought you a butter tart
from work.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.505
What're you thinking?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.974
My cholesterol...

16:15.976 --> 16:18.242
Why are you trying to kill
our father?

16:22.248 --> 16:25.416
It turns out, we have something
for you too, dad.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.417
Drumroll, please.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.152
Yeah.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.488
Ronald! Drumroll.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.724
D-d-d-d..

16:32.726 --> 16:35.660
I can't do it.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.595
We've decided that it's time
for us to start a family.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.766
Wow, I mean, that's great!

16:41.768 --> 16:43.368
Wow.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.736
You're pregnant?

16:44.738 --> 16:48.306
No, but I had my IUD
removed yesterday,

16:48.308 --> 16:51.242
so if my menstrual cycle chart
is correct

16:51.244 --> 16:52.577
I think you can expect
a grandchild

16:52.579 --> 16:55.480
by the second or third week
of June.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.415
Wow.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.317
Aah.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.785
Hey, I'm really happy.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.787
That's fantastic.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
Everybody come to the garage,

17:04.691 --> 17:05.723
I have something to show you.

17:05.724 --> 17:06.656
Come on. Come on, Ruth.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.425
Ok.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.259
Ronald.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.227
Come on, Ruthie.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.528
Ronald!

17:15.268 --> 17:16.768
You like it?

17:16.770 --> 17:19.637
How long have you been
working on this?

17:19.638 --> 17:22.173
Long enough for it to gather
some dust.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.510
Oh, dad, it's beautiful.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.511
Are you happy?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.146
It's amazing.

17:28.147 --> 17:28.813
I'm proud of you.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.081
Seriously?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.783
All she did was pull the goalie.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.621
I gotta go to work.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.588
Ok, we're good.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.689
Good side?

17:38.691 --> 17:39.690
Good side.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.428
Every time I go in there
it's happening.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.629
I just close the door.

17:53.139 --> 17:53.771
Hey, Ruth.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.540
Hey.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.409
'Sup, bitches.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.445
What're we talking about?

18:00.447 --> 18:03.181
Um... baby sign language?

18:03.183 --> 18:06.317
That's cool, I know some signs.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.155
There's your tea.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.424
Thank you.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.659
How's Ollie's head?

18:14.661 --> 18:19.564
Uh... he might have
septum damage.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.833
Sorry about that.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.334
Ruth, listen.

18:23.336 --> 18:29.474
We've been talking and we've
all decided that

18:29.476 --> 18:31.609
we don't think it's fair
to bore you

18:31.611 --> 18:35.279
with all our lame
mommy talk anymore.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.782
You can talk about it.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.751
No, um...

18:40.753 --> 18:43.254
we just think you'd be happier
if you found friends

18:43.256 --> 18:46.257
that you have more
in common with.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.458
What?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.594
You guys are my gang.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.730
You four.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.565
Look, I'm sorry about
the baby shower,

18:54.567 --> 18:55.666
I had a brain fart.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.369
Ruth, you just don't
fit in anymore.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.886
Alright, that's cool.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.543
<i>What the</i>
<i>fuck are you looking at?</i>

19:38.545 --> 19:42.680
<i>What the fuck are you</i>
<i>looking at?</i>

19:42.682 --> 19:47.185
Hey, wanna tickle my tattoo?

19:47.187 --> 19:51.255
<i>You got a nice one.</i>

19:51.257 --> 19:52.190
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:52.192 --> 19:53.724
Did that hurt?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.430
Hey.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.632
Hey, guys.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.801
Anybody going to the hospital?

20:03.803 --> 20:06.270
I need a ride to the hospital.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.339
Passing by the hospital?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.441
I need a ride.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.877
Wanna tickle my tattoo?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.854
Heyyy!!!

20:28.962 --> 20:29.462

22:39.559 --> 22:41.926
Ok, like five more minutes
and we're out of here.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.961
It's coming down.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.900
Ruth? Is that you?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.068
What're you doing here?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.703
With a stroller?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.605
Oh my god, are you
following us?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.040
What?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.474
No, I'm just cutting
through the park.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.644
Hey there, how are you feeling?

23:00.646 --> 23:03.414
Morning sickness is just
the worst, isn't it?

23:03.416 --> 23:04.081
I'm sorry, what?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.649
Morning sickness?

23:05.651 --> 23:09.587
Ruth, are you pregnant?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.398
Yep.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.100
Holy shit, why didn't
you tell us before?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.069
How? Who?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.438
Ruth's pregnant.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.873
Oh god.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.976
You know, I can't really get
into all that right now,

23:31.978 --> 23:35.446
I'm actually feeling a little
morning sickness-ish again,

23:35.448 --> 23:36.180
so...

23:36.182 --> 23:37.498
You poor thing.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.815
It's so cute that
you're practicing.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.152
Oh yeah, I am.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.523
Hey, Shannon says
she'll make you a big feast

23:45.525 --> 23:47.057
during Madison's jazz dance!

23:47.059 --> 23:49.627
Ok, great!

23:49.629 --> 23:50.895
What?

23:50.897 --> 23:51.662
Oh my god.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.597
No, it's true.

23:53.599 --> 23:58.736
So, it turns out I was lying.

23:58.738 --> 24:03.174
I was conducting,
like, a social experiment.

24:03.176 --> 24:06.043
Isn't that hilarious?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.553
Over here.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.188
Hi!

24:20.460 --> 24:24.061
So...

24:24.063 --> 24:24.895
who's the father?

24:24.897 --> 24:26.464
Was it an accident?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.032
How far along, are you passed
the three month mark?

24:28.034 --> 24:33.671
Ok, this is hilarious.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.111
It was an accident.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.814
The father...

24:43.816 --> 24:46.750
it's complicated, and past
the three month mark.

24:46.752 --> 24:47.252
Yes!

24:50.790 --> 24:53.591
Why didn't you tell us
you were pregnant?

24:53.593 --> 24:59.497
I guess I just didn't want you
to think I was pathetic.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.732
You haven't been smoking,
have you?

25:11.210 --> 25:14.011
Deb, um, hey.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.982
I woke up this morning
with cramps and um...

25:17.984 --> 25:20.017
there's bleeding.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.920
I think there's something wrong
with the baby.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.822
Call me.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.896
What?

25:40.072 --> 25:43.307
Uh, good morning everybody.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.242
I uh...

25:45.243 --> 25:47.176
I really appreciate y'all
being here,

25:47.179 --> 25:51.081
really, I do.

25:51.083 --> 25:56.153
Uh, as most of you know today
is my last day

25:56.155 --> 25:59.290
and I want to introduce you
to Danny Makerman.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.862
He's from the Value King
head office,

26:04.864 --> 26:09.099
he's going to oversee the last
part of the transition.

26:09.101 --> 26:13.270
I just wanted to say thank you
to all of you

26:13.272 --> 26:17.942
for being part of my team
and for all-

26:20.246 --> 26:22.146
I'll take over, thank you,
Mario.

26:22.148 --> 26:25.983
It's very emotional.

26:25.985 --> 26:29.687
Uh, first of all I would
just like to say "howdy".

26:29.689 --> 26:31.789
Thank you for having me.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.693
A little heads up, I know I come
across as a super fun guy,

26:35.695 --> 26:38.295
but I run a pretty tight ship,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.197
and it's my job to
ensure that we operate

26:40.199 --> 26:42.833
at Value King standards.

26:42.835 --> 26:47.237
It's gonna mean some
big changes around here.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.939
What is your name, good sir?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.207
Pedro.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.676
Pedro, I noticed
you have a little

26:52.678 --> 26:54.311
something on the uniform there.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.497
A little schmutz.

26:56.498 --> 26:58.682
Ok, well let's take a little
pride in our appearance.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.250
This is Value King.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.685
Thank you.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.655
Uh, who's station is this?

27:04.657 --> 27:07.024
Uh, mine.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.659
Right.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.293
Please have all paraphernalia
cleared out by the end of today.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.797
This is a business, not
your middle school locker.

27:14.867 --> 27:18.235
Hi, my name is Danny Makerman,

27:18.237 --> 27:20.671
I'm a super fun guy.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.205
Ruth.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.706
Mmmhmm?

27:22.708 --> 27:24.675
A word?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.417
Please, have a seat.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.961
Did you have a party
in the store?

27:45.965 --> 27:48.198
Um...

27:51.270 --> 27:56.173
I saw the whole thing
reviewing surveillance footage.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.942
We have a surveillance camera?

27:58.944 --> 28:01.779
We do.

28:01.781 --> 28:05.115
And you are fired.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.450
For what?

28:06.452 --> 28:09.153
Because I bought some chips
off hours?

28:09.155 --> 28:10.387
Yes.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.791
And because you've
just lied about it.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.161
Ok, that was stupid,
but I paid for everything

28:17.163 --> 28:19.363
and I cleaned up and...

28:19.365 --> 28:21.465
look, it will never
happen again.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.267
I have worked here
since I was 15

28:23.269 --> 28:24.735
you can't fire me.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.236
I don't have a choice.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.438
I'm sorry.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.106
Ruth, I got your message.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.774
Is everything ok with the baby?

28:30.776 --> 28:31.742
The baby?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.711
She's pregnant.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.313
Oh my god, why...

28:36.315 --> 28:38.148
why didn't you say something?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.250
Look, forget what we were
talking about.

28:40.252 --> 28:43.754
Is everything alright?

28:43.756 --> 28:48.258
Well, it was a close call
but um...

28:48.260 --> 28:51.428
it turns out that everything's
gonna be ok.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.110
Oh yeah.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.512
I'm gonna buy me a bunch
of this sports stuff.

29:08.514 --> 29:09.446
What if it's a girl?

29:09.448 --> 29:10.314
Huh?

29:10.316 --> 29:12.783
What if it's a girl?

29:12.785 --> 29:14.184
That'll be great.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.187
I'm talking, you know,
like bisexual sports stuff.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.489
Whatever.

29:20.709 --> 29:22.926
I need the Stokke Exploree but they're
sold out absolutely everywhere,

29:22.928 --> 29:24.328
so let's try here.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.497
I'm gonna wait out here.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.232
Why?

29:28.233 --> 29:29.966
Because I don't want to look
at any more baby stuff.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.102
Dad, Ruth is not supporting
my pregnancy.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.104
You're not even pregnant.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.773
See?

29:38.144 --> 29:39.476
What the hell is the matter
with you?

29:39.478 --> 29:40.928
You're gonna be a brat?

29:40.929 --> 29:42.379
You can't spend ten minutes
with your sister?

29:42.381 --> 29:43.313
Ten minutes?

29:43.315 --> 29:44.948
Fine, I'll go in.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.117
Fine, come on, let's go.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.553
Christ.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.361
I'm just saying maybe you're,
you know,

29:57.363 --> 29:59.963
jumping the gun a little.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.799
I'm sorry, I'm just doing

30:01.801 --> 30:02.966
a little thing called
"pre-planning".

30:02.968 --> 30:05.135
It's what successful people do.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.904
Because I will be pregnant.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.073
Soon.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.355
And when I get pregnant,
I'm gonna be pregnant hard.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.580
Oh, hey, guess what?

30:16.582 --> 30:18.382
The grocery store by my house
only hires people

30:18.384 --> 30:21.151
with downs syndrome
to bag groceries now,

30:21.153 --> 30:24.188
and I was like
"that's my big sister's job".

30:24.190 --> 30:29.226
Oh my god, maybe my big sister
is half downs.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.529
That would explain
why you're such a loser.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.865
I'm not a loser, ok?

30:34.867 --> 30:35.666
I'm-

30:35.667 --> 30:36.466
Take a look at this.

30:36.468 --> 30:40.971
What? What are you, Ruth?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.173
I'm pregnant.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.342
What?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.244
I'm pregnant.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.178
What are you talking about?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.913
What does that mean?

30:49.915 --> 30:51.215
With twins.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.150
A girl and a boy.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.618
You're full of shit.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.520
Hey there again.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.589
Boy, were you smart to get
the Exploree when you did

30:58.591 --> 31:00.908
because we're completely
sold out

31:00.909 --> 31:03.226
and we're not getting any more
in for a couple of months.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.295
Now is this the grandpa?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.933
You must be so excited.

31:21.947 --> 31:24.581
So um...

31:24.583 --> 31:25.949
do we know this guy?

31:25.951 --> 31:27.951
Obviously it was a drunken
one-night stand.

31:27.953 --> 31:32.089
Hey, hey. Come on.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.191
He's a doctor.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.158
Yeah?

31:36.195 --> 31:37.895
There's no way.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.368
We're in love.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.004
And he's super excited
about the babies.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.243
Nice.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.946
Why aren't you showing
if it's twins?

31:59.985 --> 32:01.118
I know, alright?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.686
I just have to keep it up
long enough

32:02.687 --> 32:04.253
to wipe that smug look
off of Hillary's face.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.255
Hey!

32:05.257 --> 32:07.157
Don't touch that.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.260
Get your beady judging
eyes off me.

32:20.172 --> 32:24.641
Oh yeah, about four months.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.077
I know.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.550
Dammit.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.084
Pedro, this is your
last warning.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.071
And no more earphones.

32:37.072 --> 32:39.056
I can hear Britney Spears
across the store.

32:39.058 --> 32:42.192
Who doesn't like Britney Spears?

32:42.194 --> 32:45.495
Ruth, shirts must be tucked in.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.131
Then I would need
a bigger size.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.666
Oh, right.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.734
Yes.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.370
Boy, you've really popped.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.605
You know, we should put
the crazy, sugary cereals

32:55.607 --> 32:58.442
on a higher shelf
so kids can't reach them.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.477
Kids reaching them
is the point.

33:00.479 --> 33:06.750
<i>Manager, override on three.</i>

33:06.752 --> 33:11.088
Excuse me.

33:30.309 --> 33:34.044
I know your little secret.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.178
What're you talking about?

33:35.180 --> 33:37.514
Your oven, she is empty.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.583
What?

33:39.585 --> 33:41.485
No bun.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.353
Ok, you're loco.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.757
In my country I was a doctor.

33:46.759 --> 33:49.426
I can tell a fake oven
when I see one.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.295
Are you telling me that you
are a doctor?

33:52.297 --> 33:54.264
Ok, well I guess
you're a little rusty then

33:54.266 --> 33:57.334
because I'm fully pregnant.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.672
Ok.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.447
I can't believe you
just did that.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.183
Please don't tell anyone.

34:13.185 --> 34:16.753
Ok, you make sure I don't
get fired

34:16.755 --> 34:19.656
and your secret is safe
with me.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.559
Are you blackmailing me
right now?

34:22.561 --> 34:25.128
Si, I am blackmailing you.

34:25.130 --> 34:29.199
I have five children to support.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.384
Ok, well look.

34:30.385 --> 34:31.568
The whole thing is stupid.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.638
It's been fun and everything,
but it's over now, so...

34:34.639 --> 34:37.507
tell whoever you want,
I don't give a shit.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.252
I'm looking for my dad.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.788
Walter Huxley?

34:51.790 --> 34:55.225
That's right.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.160
Oh my god.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.396
He had a heart attack.

35:02.801 --> 35:03.800
Come here, honey.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.869
Excuse us for a second.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.304
I'm sorry, what?

35:07.305 --> 35:08.738
Just excuse us for a second.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.383
I'm strong as a bull.

35:20.385 --> 35:23.286
Girls, the doctor says keep
the stress to a minimum,

35:23.288 --> 35:25.689
but he can go home
whenever he's ready.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.224
Wait, no chance.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.658
I'm not going home
until after tomorrow

35:28.660 --> 35:31.128
because you promised me
a sponge bath.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.130
Dad, that's disgusting.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.266
It is not disgusting.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.168
And you don't gotta worry
about me kicking it

35:38.170 --> 35:41.371
because I'm not going anywhere
until I see my grandkids.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.274
Hi, I'm Dr. Gallagher.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.175
Walter.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.326
Hey.

35:46.327 --> 35:47.476
A quick update for you here.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.412
Wait a minute, aren't
you that guy from the-

35:49.414 --> 35:51.548
Oh, no, he just looks...
sort of looks-

35:51.550 --> 35:53.567
Oh, hi.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.585
Did I leave my iPhone case
on your counter?

35:55.587 --> 35:56.419
I was sure that I-

35:56.421 --> 35:57.220
Oh, yeah.

35:57.222 --> 35:58.055
You did.

35:58.056 --> 35:58.889
Because I got the page and-

35:58.891 --> 35:59.890
Oh shit!

35:59.892 --> 36:01.558
You're actually a doctor??

36:01.560 --> 36:03.760
Oh my gosh, you're the guy!

36:03.762 --> 36:05.395
You're the guy.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.897
You're the guy!

36:06.899 --> 36:08.916
This is good.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.934
I mean, I thought you'd take off
running into the woods,

36:10.936 --> 36:12.352
you know?

36:12.353 --> 36:13.769
No, I generally finish
my rounds.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.406
Well, you are a sane one man.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.741
Just doing my job, sir.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.242
Speaking of which,
all good news.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.443
I think we can get you out
of here pretty quick.

36:20.445 --> 36:21.611
Oh, yeah, that too.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.430
Right.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.248
Ok everyone, I think
that Dr. Ted, uh...

36:25.250 --> 36:29.686
I mean Ted is pretty busy
with his other patients who are-

36:29.688 --> 36:32.522
Well, I am a patient.

36:32.524 --> 36:38.528
And I want to say that son,
I'm proud of you.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.597
I mean, el toro.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.899
You know?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.200
Twins, you know
what I'm saying?

36:43.202 --> 36:48.572
Twins... twin... zeros,
with a five in front.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.673
Remember?

36:49.674 --> 36:50.773
That was your number
for the groceries?

36:50.776 --> 36:51.708
Right.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.641
Anyway, this is how we met.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.946
Congrats on that for us so yay!

36:55.948 --> 36:58.215
Ok everyone, say goodbye
to Dr. Ted.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.317
Hey, Dr. Ted.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.852
Next week, one night just
come by, you know,

37:02.854 --> 37:04.955
we'll sit and talk,
we'll have a drink.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.607
Ok.

37:06.608 --> 37:08.258
Darn, he's actually got
rounds that night.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.660
Ok, I'll see you
at the store later?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.495
Nope.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.330
Ok, have a wicked surgery, Ted.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.632
Teddy bear.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.374
Have you told anyone yet?

37:25.344 --> 37:28.295
Look. I need to stay pregnant
for a little while longer,

37:28.296 --> 37:31.247
also I'm afraid my dad is going
to die of a broken heart,

37:31.250 --> 37:33.550
literally.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.354
Will you please keep my secret?

37:37.356 --> 37:39.840
Ok, look.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.325
You scratch my back,
I'll scratch your back.

37:42.327 --> 37:46.663
Excuse your reach,
sure, no problem.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.731
Ruth.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.599
Can I speak to you
in my office?

37:49.601 --> 37:50.734
Why?

37:50.736 --> 37:53.370
It should only take a minute.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.346
So.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.914
Are the babies kicking yet?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.349
Sorta.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.284
It's amazing.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.069
I read that.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.110
Four months, that's about
when it starts.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.492
The dad must be excited.

38:15.494 --> 38:18.295
Oh yeah, he's already referring
to himself as "grandpa".

38:18.297 --> 38:19.630
Oh, no, no.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.964
I meant the babies' dad.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.399
Oh, right.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.001
Yeah, he is.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.871
He's a doctor, so he knows a lot
about babies.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.072
Your boyfriend's a pediatrician.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.341
Cardiologist.

38:31.343 --> 38:31.843
Wow.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.550
Can I speak to you
in confidence?

38:40.552 --> 38:43.019
I've had three people
quit this week.

38:43.021 --> 38:47.691
Any idea why?

38:47.693 --> 38:51.394
May I speak candidly?

38:51.396 --> 38:55.332
They're calling you
"Danny Dictator".

38:55.334 --> 38:58.802
Ah.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.637
I commend your honesty.

39:00.639 --> 39:03.073
It's not a problem.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.475
Sales are down,
clientele are leaving

39:05.477 --> 39:08.778
despite the fact that everything
is newer and cheaper.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.781
They're not happy upstairs.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.450
I think customers miss bantering

39:13.452 --> 39:15.518
with a grumpy old
man when they shop.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.020
This isn't uptown.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.822
People want, like,
a neighbourhood feel

39:18.824 --> 39:20.690
to their shopping experience.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.125
So soften the corporate edges?

39:22.127 --> 39:24.794
Exactly.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.029
Maybe I should put Mariah's
soccer flags

39:26.031 --> 39:27.530
back up on the wall?

39:27.532 --> 39:29.532
That's a great idea.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.936
<i>Oh my god, I'm</i>
<i>going to see this place</i>

39:32.938 --> 39:36.106
<i>within an inch of it's life,</i>
<i>oh my god.</i>

39:36.108 --> 39:39.876
Oh goodness, oh ma'am,
are you ok?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.010
Are you alright?

39:41.012 --> 39:41.911
Here we are, ok.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.546
Pedro?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.048
Si, señor?

39:45.050 --> 39:47.384
Where is the "caution,
wet floor" sign?

39:47.386 --> 39:49.085
Here, easy.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.854
Alright.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.622
That's it, that was
your last chance.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.491
Oh, um...

39:54.493 --> 39:56.659
it was me.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.395
What?

39:58.397 --> 39:59.796
Yeah, uh...

39:59.798 --> 40:02.599
I was the one who forgot
to put the sign out.

40:02.601 --> 40:08.638
Sorry, I've just got major
pregnant brain.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.006
Well, it's...

40:10.008 --> 40:12.542
nothing's broken.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.744
Why don't you just take me out
to my car

40:14.746 --> 40:16.112
and then we'll call it even.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.181
Ok, take it easy there.

40:23.455 --> 40:24.788
I apologize.

40:25.557 --> 40:29.559
So you're giving me a gift
certificate, right?

40:29.561 --> 40:31.461
I forgive you.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.902
Ok, there's Libby eating
a watermelon,

40:38.904 --> 40:43.173
and on the porch,
on the swing...

40:43.175 --> 40:46.609
brushing her teeth, good job.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.371
And...

40:48.446 --> 40:49.846
that's when she tried on
my heels.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.047
That's not even right.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.949
Why?

40:52.951 --> 40:55.652
Because it's so cute?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.854
Oh.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.989
I have a present for you.

40:59.991 --> 41:00.890
You do?

41:00.892 --> 41:03.910
Yeah.

41:03.911 --> 41:06.929
No! You can't eat that, sugar
may cause ADD in fetuses.

41:06.932 --> 41:07.764
It's made with honey.

41:07.766 --> 41:08.798
Honey is sugar.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.966
But it's natural.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.168
So is cocaine.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.938
I enrolled you in
a Lamaze class.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.806
It is called "Finding your
flower power"

41:16.808 --> 41:18.575
and it is amazing.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.610
So amazing.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.644
The flower imagery really
opened up my cervix.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.482
My vagina is a blooming orchid.

41:25.484 --> 41:28.251
I like to think of my vagina
as an overripe peach.

41:28.253 --> 41:32.021
I credit this class with my last
birth being entirely pain-free.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.624
And Mr. Epidural.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.660
No drugs.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.497
We have been birthing babies
since the beginning of time.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.866
It's what we are built to do.

41:42.868 --> 41:45.668
Besides, I don't want my baby
coming into this world

41:45.670 --> 41:47.270
stoned out of her gourd.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.940
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a form of child abuse.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.809
I guess so.

41:52.811 --> 41:56.179
I actually had an orgasm
during Madison's birth.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.147
Ok, that's hot.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.850
Guys, we should totally
all go out on Friday night,

42:00.852 --> 42:02.285
live it up.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.719
CeCe Peniston is having
a comeback tour,

42:03.722 --> 42:04.687
we should all go!

42:04.689 --> 42:07.190
Oh my god, yes, that!

42:07.192 --> 42:09.759
¶ Finally, it has
happened to me, ¶

42:09.761 --> 42:11.694
¶ right in front of my face ¶

42:11.696 --> 42:15.265
¶ and I just cannot
hide it... ¶

42:18.236 --> 42:21.738
I'll probably pass.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.240
Yeah, my kids have
swimming lessons.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.986
Hey.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.822
Hop in.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.858
So what is this surprise?

42:41.860 --> 42:47.163
Well, first of all we're going
to pick up this Dr. Ted fellow.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.965
Where does he live?

42:48.966 --> 42:50.766
This is something
he's gotta see.

42:50.769 --> 42:51.734
He's out of town.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.019
Still?

42:53.020 --> 42:54.303
What, has he got an office
in Cleveland?

42:54.306 --> 42:55.638
I mean, that's not good.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.140
Not good at all.

42:57.142 --> 42:59.242
I booked you for
a 3D ultrasound.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.076
What?!

43:00.078 --> 43:03.246
Is that a problem?

43:03.248 --> 43:05.281
No.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.820
I gotta pee.

43:22.968 --> 43:24.801
Hey, it's Ruth.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.375
Jesus.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.876
Thought you fell in.

43:33.878 --> 43:35.345
You've been gone 20 minutes.

43:35.347 --> 43:37.880
You can lie down here.

43:37.882 --> 43:42.852
Oh, wow really, just like that.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.687
Ok.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.942
Wait, um...

44:05.944 --> 44:08.344
are you sure this is safe?

44:08.346 --> 44:10.346
Yes.

44:10.348 --> 44:11.981
And this, um...

44:11.983 --> 44:13.683
this procedure
has been approved

44:13.685 --> 44:17.787
by the Pediatric Medical
Association?

44:17.789 --> 44:19.288
Yes.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.924
May I um...

44:21.926 --> 44:23.726
see the literature on that?

44:25.397 --> 44:28.064
Excuse me.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.700
Hello?

44:30.702 --> 44:35.004
I don't have a Mexican cousin.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.140
Excuse me for a minute.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.854
Hello, hello.

44:51.856 --> 44:55.324
I am Dr. Pedro.

44:55.326 --> 45:00.363
The other lady,
she got the um...

45:00.365 --> 45:02.298
woman's period.

45:02.300 --> 45:05.168
So Dr. Pedro will be doing
the ultrasound.

45:05.170 --> 45:10.006
I didn't know that ultrasound
technicians were doctors.

45:10.008 --> 45:12.008
Uh, yeah.

45:12.009 --> 45:14.009
Ok, turn the back, turn
the back, you can't see this.

45:14.012 --> 45:14.811
Why?

45:14.813 --> 45:16.212
Why?

45:16.214 --> 45:17.814
Why?

45:17.816 --> 45:20.383
Why?

45:20.385 --> 45:22.418
Because in my culture,

45:22.420 --> 45:27.290
the uterus is the most
sacred part of a woman,

45:27.292 --> 45:29.959
only to be seen by her husband

45:29.961 --> 45:33.763
and a medical professional
like Dr. Pedro.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.965
Wow, that's true, huh?

45:35.967 --> 45:37.650
I've been to Cancun.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.334
It doesn't seem like
much of anything is sacred.

45:39.337 --> 45:42.371
Ok, now turn, turn around,
and no peeking

45:42.373 --> 45:47.810
or the ultrasound is over
and there will be no refund.

45:47.812 --> 45:51.047
Ok.

45:51.049 --> 45:52.882
Have you started yet?

45:52.884 --> 45:54.484
Yes.

45:54.486 --> 45:55.985
Ooooh...

45:55.987 --> 45:59.522
two cute girls.

45:59.524 --> 46:00.490
Girls?

46:00.492 --> 46:02.425
As cute as the Olsen twins.

46:02.427 --> 46:04.193
Ah, fuck me.

46:04.195 --> 46:04.994
Sorry.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.429
Oh, no, wait.

46:06.431 --> 46:10.933
I see a little twig
and two small berries.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.268
They're so cute.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.137
They're playing patty-cake
together.

46:14.139 --> 46:15.805
I gotta see this.

46:15.807 --> 46:17.140
Wait, wait, wait!

46:17.142 --> 46:18.908
I am getting the manager.

46:18.910 --> 46:22.311
Oh, ok.

46:22.313 --> 46:26.816
Would you like to see these
ultrasound photos I printed out?

46:26.818 --> 46:29.018
I think I might, yeah.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.920
Thank you.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.425
Wow.

46:42.467 --> 46:48.037
To your masterful pull-off.

46:48.039 --> 46:50.139
Where did you get
ultrasound photos?

46:50.141 --> 46:51.240
From the internet.

46:51.242 --> 46:53.543
Those were Brad
and Angelina's twins.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.114
Amazing.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.920
Andrea,

47:03.922 --> 47:06.088
you keep your brothers quiet.

47:06.090 --> 47:08.958
These Swedish meatballs
are aces, Maria.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.194
I totally thought we'd be eating
tacos or something.

47:11.196 --> 47:12.528
Maria loves to cook things.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.197
Everything.

47:14.199 --> 47:17.333
You ought to try her borscht.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.136
How far along it's supposed
to be?

47:20.138 --> 47:21.370
Oh, uh...

47:21.372 --> 47:23.539
I don't know, six months-ish?

47:23.541 --> 47:27.577
Your belly looks small
and lumpy.

47:27.579 --> 47:31.514
I used to sew fake Louis Vuitton
bags in Mexico.

47:31.516 --> 47:32.882
Take your belly off.

47:32.884 --> 47:34.617
I will fit it for you.

47:34.619 --> 47:35.985
Really?

47:35.987 --> 47:39.155
You help my husband
keep his job.

47:39.157 --> 47:42.325
I will help you.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.994
The fake Louis Vuitton bags
were beautiful.

47:44.996 --> 47:47.063
I'll get you one.

47:47.065 --> 47:49.098
Sweet.

48:02.347 --> 48:03.479
The flags look good.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.548
Yeah, they do.

48:05.550 --> 48:06.883
What's going on with these?

48:06.885 --> 48:09.118
They expire next month.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.254
Either we mark them down
or toss them.

48:11.256 --> 48:12.405
Oh.

48:12.406 --> 48:13.555
Shit, you know
what we should do?

48:13.558 --> 48:16.359
We could have, like,
ethnic food theme weeks.

48:16.361 --> 48:19.061
Put recipes around
on those placards.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.397
Yeah, with the ingredients
that we sell in the store.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.965
Yeah, this could be
Mexican week,

48:22.966 --> 48:24.532
we could move these beans
before they expire.

48:24.535 --> 48:27.236
The fresh salsa that's in
the deli that's on it's way out.

48:27.238 --> 48:30.473
Staff could even wear sombreros.

48:30.475 --> 48:36.078
Except maybe not
the last thing.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.215
There's someone from
head office coming in

48:39.217 --> 48:41.150
to tour the store tomorrow,

48:41.152 --> 48:43.019
I think you should be there.

48:43.021 --> 48:44.620
Seriously?

48:47.425 --> 48:50.159
Ok.

48:50.161 --> 48:52.361
He wants me to be there
with the big wigs.

48:52.363 --> 48:54.697
He said he thinks I've got
a head for business.

48:54.699 --> 48:57.700
Nice.

48:57.702 --> 49:03.306
You sure he wasn't mistaking
you for someone else?

49:03.308 --> 49:07.643
Miss Sensitive, it's humour.

49:07.645 --> 49:10.246
You still vegetarian?

49:10.248 --> 49:11.080
What?

49:11.082 --> 49:13.382
Like uh... kids.

49:13.384 --> 49:16.202
They need meat.

49:16.203 --> 49:19.021
They need meat to build muscles,
have an attitude of aggression,

49:19.023 --> 49:19.689
you know.

49:19.691 --> 49:21.524
Right.

49:21.526 --> 49:25.461
Anyway, um, it's kind of
a big deal.

49:25.463 --> 49:29.565
Yeah, I mean that
really sounds good.

49:29.567 --> 49:33.269
So what do you say
you eat upstairs tonight

49:33.271 --> 49:35.504
and I fry you up
a nice big steak.

49:38.609 --> 49:39.709
Sounds good, dad.

49:39.711 --> 49:42.478
Great.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.113
So there's this.

49:44.115 --> 49:45.147
Wow.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.766
Sorry, there's a rule that says

49:46.767 --> 49:48.384
when you're pregnant you have
to dress like a clown.

49:48.386 --> 49:49.552
No, it's great.

49:49.554 --> 49:50.553
Thank you.

49:50.555 --> 49:51.587
No, thank you.

49:51.588 --> 49:52.620
Maybe if these clothes
are out of my closet

49:52.623 --> 49:54.023
I'll stop wearing them.

49:58.663 --> 49:59.662
Hello?

49:59.664 --> 50:01.164
<i>Hey, it's Danny.</i>

50:01.165 --> 50:02.665
<i>Is there a trick</i>
<i>to the fuse box?</i>

50:02.667 --> 50:04.533
Oh yeah, you need to jiggle it.

50:04.535 --> 50:07.069
<i>I'm jiggling it and</i>
<i>it's not opening.</i>

50:07.071 --> 50:10.673
Ok, it's kind of between a
jiggle and a shake and a...

50:10.675 --> 50:12.441
I'll come in.

50:12.443 --> 50:14.076
I gotta go, work emergency.

50:14.078 --> 50:15.578
But finish your snacks.

50:15.580 --> 50:20.449
Ruth, wait.

50:20.451 --> 50:23.152
I got us tickets to CeCe.

50:23.154 --> 50:25.087
Awesome!

50:25.089 --> 50:26.022
Thank you.

50:26.024 --> 50:28.657
You're welcome.

50:28.659 --> 50:29.425
I'm so excited!

50:29.427 --> 50:31.227
Me too.

50:36.334 --> 50:40.236
Oh, are you kidding me?

50:40.238 --> 50:42.238
How'd you blow a fuse?

50:42.240 --> 50:48.310
I had the lights on and music...

50:48.312 --> 50:49.645
What?

50:49.647 --> 50:51.781
It needs... nothing.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.486
Thank you for doing this.

50:57.488 --> 51:00.389
Yeah, no problem.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.358
Oh, no, no, no!

51:02.360 --> 51:04.493
The freezers!

51:04.495 --> 51:06.829
Fuck, I'm an idiot.

51:06.831 --> 51:09.498
Head office gets here at 7 am.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.367
Chill. We'll clean it up.

51:11.369 --> 51:12.635
You can't. You're pregnant.

51:12.637 --> 51:13.736
Yeah, but not disabled.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.704
Let's get the mops.

51:15.706 --> 51:16.639
Yeah?

51:16.641 --> 51:17.807
Yeah. Let's do this thing.

51:19.811 --> 51:21.377
Ugh.

51:21.379 --> 51:21.879
¶¶¶

51:35.593 --> 51:38.427
Ok, can we please listen
to anything else?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.463
Knock yourself out.

51:50.741 --> 51:54.577
You have CeCe Peniston
in your iPod?

51:54.579 --> 51:56.345
What?

51:56.347 --> 52:00.249
It's not mine.

52:00.251 --> 52:00.751

[CeCe Peniston's "Finally" ¶¶¶

52:59.443 --> 53:07.443
[CeCe Peniston's "Finally" ¶¶¶

53:11.656 --> 53:17.293
Shit, they are gonna be here
any second.

53:17.295 --> 53:22.264
Don't worry,
it's insanely fluffy.

53:22.266 --> 53:23.866
You know, you should probably
call your man now,

53:23.868 --> 53:25.668
get him to pick you up
after the tour.

53:25.670 --> 53:27.987
Oh, he can't,

53:27.988 --> 53:30.305
he's got a lung operation
this morning.

53:30.308 --> 53:31.907
Oh, that must be
a tricky surgery.

53:31.909 --> 53:37.279
Especially considering
he's a heart surgeon.

53:37.281 --> 53:40.282
I'm a loser.

53:40.284 --> 53:43.652
Danny-o.

53:43.654 --> 53:45.754
Uh, you know what, I'm sorry.

53:45.756 --> 53:47.423
It's none of my business.

53:47.425 --> 53:49.458
Linda, hi.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.926
Hey. Ok.

53:50.928 --> 53:53.362
I didn't know it was you
who was coming.

53:53.364 --> 53:55.331
Uh, this is Ruth Huxley.

53:55.332 --> 53:57.299
She's a real valuable member
to the new store.

53:57.301 --> 53:58.934
Hi. This is your first?

53:58.936 --> 54:00.336
Uh, yes.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.371
You and your husband
must be so excited.

54:02.373 --> 54:04.373
Oh, I'm not married.

54:04.375 --> 54:08.310
Oh, well, I guess we need
some work on the values

54:08.312 --> 54:11.981
at this Value King, don't we?

54:11.983 --> 54:16.252
Uh, what Ruth meant to say
is that she's not married yet.

54:16.254 --> 54:19.688
Our wedding is set
for next month.

54:19.690 --> 54:21.790
Oh, I had no idea that-

54:21.792 --> 54:22.925
Yes, we are both very excited.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.294
Thank you for asking.

54:25.296 --> 54:27.496
Shall we start in deli?

54:33.604 --> 54:36.038
Why didn't the painters
catch this?

54:36.040 --> 54:38.674
I thought it was charming.

54:51.722 --> 54:54.790
I'd like to keep the fruit
selections to the domestics.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.326
If the store is going to go
generic ghetto style,

54:57.328 --> 54:58.994
people are just gonna go
to the superstore.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.897
I'm sorry, what's that?

55:01.899 --> 55:03.766
Uh, I'm just saying people are
going to need a reason

55:03.768 --> 55:05.567
to come here, right?

55:05.569 --> 55:07.002
They came to Mario's
because it was different.

55:07.004 --> 55:09.938
Yeah, It was also a money drain,
which is why it was sold.

55:11.375 --> 55:12.892
Ok, fine!

55:12.893 --> 55:14.410
Then we'll get absolutely
nothing!

55:14.412 --> 55:15.611
You suck!

55:15.613 --> 55:17.613
I want ice cream.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.515
Why do people do that?

55:19.517 --> 55:21.617
It's the child-meltdown-abort-
Mission move.

55:21.619 --> 55:25.521
Happens all the time.

55:25.523 --> 55:28.724
Actually, you know,

55:28.726 --> 55:33.529
if there was some sort of
kid's play area here,

55:33.531 --> 55:35.931
like if parents got a little
break from snotty noses

55:35.933 --> 55:38.067
and Elmo impressions
while they shopped,

55:38.069 --> 55:43.038
that might give people a reason
to come here.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.107
Ok, my friends
would totally come here

55:45.109 --> 55:47.042
for something like that.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.479
You know, the way that people
go furniture shopping at IKEA

55:50.481 --> 55:51.914
not because you
need a crappy bookshelf

55:51.916 --> 55:53.349
that you have to assemble
yourself

55:53.351 --> 55:54.950
with Swedish instructions,

55:54.952 --> 55:59.888
but because there's a ballroom
and one dollar hot dogs.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.523
Sell the experience.

56:01.525 --> 56:04.426
Not the products.

56:04.428 --> 56:08.464
It's not bad.

56:08.466 --> 56:11.734
Ok, bye.

56:20.644 --> 56:21.677
Come on.

56:21.679 --> 56:23.512
I'm giving you a ride home.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.050
I never would have guessed
you were such a rebel

56:28.052 --> 56:29.752
when I first met you.

56:29.754 --> 56:32.020
I'm not, normally.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.656
I never would have guessed
you're such a smarty pants.

56:34.658 --> 56:36.792
I guess that stoner plush you
taped to your check out counter

56:36.794 --> 56:37.993
threw me off the scent.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.828
Shut up.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.864
I'm sorry I underestimated you.

56:41.866 --> 56:43.966
Underachieving is sort
of my speciality.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.834
I'm here.

56:52.042 --> 56:52.941
Thank you.

56:52.943 --> 56:54.176
Oh, wait.

56:54.178 --> 56:56.145
It's a big step.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.621
Wow, this is some
serious service.

57:05.623 --> 57:07.623
You can give me a ride home
every day if you want to.

57:07.625 --> 57:09.458
I'd be honoured to.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.093
I was kidding.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.961
Yeah.

57:12.963 --> 57:14.163
I had fun today.

57:14.165 --> 57:15.764
Me too.

57:15.766 --> 57:19.168
Remember how pissed that
lady was that I'm single?

57:19.170 --> 57:26.141
That woman is an idiot.

57:26.143 --> 57:29.912
Well, this is me.

57:29.914 --> 57:30.879
Thank you.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.714
Yeah.

57:32.716 --> 57:33.549
See you tomorrow?

57:33.551 --> 57:34.051
Yeah.

57:37.555 --> 57:40.122
Are you just getting home?

57:40.124 --> 57:41.523
Why are you here?

57:41.525 --> 57:43.559
I took dad to his appointment.

57:45.029 --> 57:45.928
Hey Ruth, no.

57:45.930 --> 57:47.663
No coffee.

57:54.038 --> 57:57.473
Seven pounds, four ounces?

57:57.475 --> 58:01.944
Oh shit, Shannon had her baby!

58:01.946 --> 58:03.545
Oh, the skinny one?

58:03.547 --> 58:05.113
That's good for her.

58:05.115 --> 58:06.014
I'm out.

58:06.016 --> 58:07.850
Just finish the game.

58:07.852 --> 58:10.719
Hey Ruthie, don't worry
about taking out your garbage,

58:10.721 --> 58:12.054
I'll do it ok?

58:12.056 --> 58:13.606
Dad!

58:13.607 --> 58:15.157
You're supposed to be taking
it easy.

58:15.159 --> 58:19.761
I'm not running a marathon,
I'm taking out garbage.

58:19.763 --> 58:20.896
Where did that come from?

58:20.898 --> 58:22.831
See? You should pay
more attention.

58:41.285 --> 58:45.888
So, everything go according
to your birth plan?

58:45.890 --> 58:48.090
Mmmhmm.

58:48.092 --> 58:50.726
40 hours of labour
and no drugs?

58:50.728 --> 58:54.930
You must be super human.

58:54.932 --> 58:56.665
Are you sure you didn't
take drugs, Shan?

58:56.667 --> 59:00.903
'Cause your eyes look
a little droopy.

59:00.905 --> 59:04.606
Yeah, maybe that's
because of your shirt.

59:04.608 --> 59:05.941
Why are you wearing that
in here?

59:05.943 --> 59:07.709
It's making me dizzy.

59:07.711 --> 59:08.844
Move!

59:08.846 --> 59:10.045
Sorry.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.880
Jesus.

59:11.882 --> 59:14.583
Oh my god, Ruth, is that
your boyfriend?

59:14.585 --> 59:17.686
Oh my god.

59:17.688 --> 59:19.087
Oh no.

59:19.089 --> 59:20.923
What a bastard!

59:20.925 --> 59:23.258
Giant soccer ball head.

59:25.329 --> 59:26.828
You have to confront him!

59:26.830 --> 59:27.996
You have to!

59:27.997 --> 59:29.163
You caught him cheating
red-handed!

59:29.166 --> 59:30.132
He's an asshole!

59:30.134 --> 59:31.033
We'll go with you.

59:31.034 --> 59:31.933
We'll be your back up.

59:31.936 --> 59:33.335
No.

59:34.271 --> 59:38.273
This is really something
I have to do for myself.

59:50.688 --> 59:52.254
Goddammit, how many times
do I have to visit

59:52.256 --> 59:54.122
this freaking hospital?

59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.965
If you
try and get away again...

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.367
I like the way you think.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.038
You.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.773
Again.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.810
Can we help you with something?

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:15.844
Give him hell, Ruth!

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:17.646
Yeah!

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.154
Can... you...

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.623
tell...

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.624
me...

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.709
I can't hear what she's saying.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.793
Yeah, but it looks like
she's really giving it to him.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:33.962
Where...

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.397
the...

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:38.066
bathroom... is?

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.969
Sorry about this in advance.

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:44.673
It's over!

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.276
Oh my god.

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:51.146
You're cheating on me
with a pregnant woman?!

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.848
No!

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.982
Fuck!

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:54.750
Jesus!

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:55.784
Shit!

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.753
<i>Shame!</i>

01:00:57.755 --> 01:01:00.255
Shaaaaame!

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:02.324
Hey, hold on!

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:03.392
Hold on!

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.068
Jesus Christ!

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.369
What're you doing down here?

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:15.837
Whatever I want.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.972
It's dad's house.

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:22.044
Where's Ted's toothbrush?

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.145
Ted and I broke up.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.947
Oh, you did, did you?

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:27.849
Where's your bassinet?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:28.684
Change table?

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:29.685
Baby swing?

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:30.852
Don't have them yet.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.054
Where's the nursery going
to go?

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.890
I haven't gotten that far.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:38.093
All you've got
is that stroller?

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.028
This is complete bullshit!

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.364
For 30 years I have been
the one making dad happy,

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.398
doing everything right.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.734
Freaking filing his taxes!

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:47.569
Hill, calm down.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.403
And suddenly you are touched
by the hands of god?

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.440
It doesn't make any sense!

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:56.078
Take your purse.

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:00.248
Stop snooping in my stuff.

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:08.023
Maybe it's time to take
the belly off.

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:10.192
And murder my father?

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:16.064
We're gonna have to steal
some newborn twins.

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:20.102
Hey.

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:21.236
Hey.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.105
So I have some good news.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.373
Food sales are up eight percent.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:28.443
We want to make you assistant
manager of the store.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:29.911
For real?

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.848
Ta-da-ta-da!!!!

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:36.952
I'll take that.

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:39.388
Congratulations.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:41.823
Can I take you out to dinner
tonight to celebrate?

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:44.159
Uh, my girlfriend and I

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.361
are actually going to
a concert tonight.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:47.362
Ah, it was a long shot.

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:50.265
Tomorrow.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.467
Done.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.107
No.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.809
Ugh.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.489
Hey!

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.392
You look wicked, Deb!

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.960
Julie!

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.362
I didn't know you were coming!

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.598
Mama needs a drink.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:24.833
And we thought you needed
extra break-up back up.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:27.869
Wow, it looks different
in here.

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.973
Praise the lord,
the band is back.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.842
: Hi, Officer Huxley.

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:36.144
Hi.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.112
You guys been behaving
yourselves?

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:37.846
No.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:38.980
Not at all.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.248
Ruth.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.416
What's this?

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.319
Oh, they made me
assistant manager.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.921
Congratulations!

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:47.088
That's awesome!

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.707
Yeah.

01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:50.325
I'll tell you what's
really awesome.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.394
The way you guys look.

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.462
I mean, you're pretty,
you know... nice.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:55.497
Ok. Get out.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.231
What?

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.199
Out.

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:58.099
Thank you.

01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:59.935
Get out.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.104
Ok.

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:05.240
I used to have the dirtiest
dreams about your dad.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.042
Get out.

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.510
I'd have to change my pajamas.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.045
Stop!

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:12.347
What?

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.215
That's uncomfortable.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.015
Why?

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.083
He's hot.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:17.352
Oh, god.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.888
Ugh.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:22.423
Remember we used to get stoned
and lay on this bed for hours

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:27.863
playing "do you think
he's circumcised or not"?

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.397
Remember those stars you had?

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:31.099
Oh yeah, I do.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.269
No!

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.337
Yes, there is the penis
constellation.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:47.215
Please tell me you have weed.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.617
No!

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:50.886
We've got tickets to CeCe
Peniston, for christ's sake.

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.053
CeCe!

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.390
CeCe, CeCe, CeCe...

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.459
We could get high first.

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:01.596
Alright, let's do it.

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:04.599
CeCe, CeCe...

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.671
¶ Finally, you've come along, ¶

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:12.407
¶ the way I feel about you ¶

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:16.044
¶ just can't be wrong. ¶

01:05:16.046 --> 01:05:19.080
¶ If you only knew ¶

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.983
¶ the way I feel about you, ¶

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:26.054
¶ I just can't describe it. ¶

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:28.223
¶ No. ¶

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:32.560
¶ Finally it has happened
to me ¶

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:35.630

¶ right in front of my face ¶

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:52.213
¶ and I just cannot hide it. ¶

¶ Finally, it has-¶

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:08.396
I'm so sorry.

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.332
Don't worry about it.

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:12.615
Do you know how many times
you've done this for me?

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:21.309
I feel really weird
and I don't know why.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.311
'Cause you're sober.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.381
Oh my god, I think you might
be right.

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:30.185
Ok, this is going
to sounds nuts,

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:36.091
but I am hammered and
I'm sweaty, so sweaty!

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:38.393
And I have to get up
in four hours

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:42.597
to take my demon to school.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.400
But somehow, I feel refreshed.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:47.102
I know what you mean.

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:47.635
Cheers.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.037
Cheers.

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:51.473
Pizza.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:54.042
I love you guys.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.111
I love pizza.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:07:00.715
Hey guys, can you check
the tp sitch in the ladies?

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:03.451
Oh, we're nic-ing out right
now, so we're gonna go out.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.614
Break's not for thirty,
but in the meantime...

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:15.530
So uh, we still on for tonight?

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.232
Mmmhmm.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:20.335
Good.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.037
Yes.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:41.289
Fuck.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.539
Hi.

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:58.573
Hi.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.541
You're early.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:01.343
Yeah, sorry.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.625
I guess they've finished
construction on the bridge.

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:09.117
May I come in?

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:12.554
I'm not ready yet.

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:15.490
Your father is
watching me from the window.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.225
Ok, come on in and wait.

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:18.693
Ok.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:41.582
Ruth?

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:43.417
<i>I'm just in the bathroom.</i>

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:02.871
Uh, so I am taking you
to La Terrazzo tonight.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.772
I just don't think that
microwave garbage

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:07.642
you eat for lunch
is actually pasta.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.578
Uh huh.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.346
<i>Look, I know I probably don't</i>
<i>have to say this,</i>

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:17.185
<i>but I didn't promote you</i>
<i>to get in your pants.</i>

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.353
Great.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.787
You deserve it.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:22.256
Mario was right, you're
the heart of the store.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.363
You looked sexy in
your uniform today.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.299
Is that bad to say?

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:36.938
Ok, sorry, that was
inappropriate.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:41.576
Everything ok in there?

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:46.514
Ruth?

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:52.819
Uh, Danny, I can't go
to dinner.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.956
What's going on?

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:56.591
I'm just...

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:00.929
I'm not feeling very good.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.330
Oh.

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:03.698
Ok, yeah, of course.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.233
We can stay in.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.601
Do you have any ginger root?

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:08.269
I'll make a tea.

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:13.441
I don't want tea.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.376
Can you just go?

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.245
<i>Please?</i>

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:20.415
Yeah, of course.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.250
Absolutely.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:50.979
The belly needs
to be bigger now.

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.313
This got all fluffy.

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:53.715
It's not good.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.750
I need to build a base.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.519
This will take maybe
three days.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:00.188
Three days?

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.856
What am I supposed to do without
the belly for three days?

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.738
I've got birthing
class tomorrow.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.964
Wait a second.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.006
I think I know where
we can get a base.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.445
There.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.546
This is too crazy.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:27.448
I know, alright?

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.349
But it's just for a little while
longer so shut your face.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.018
Can we do this?

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.288
Ok.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.689
Ok, let's go.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:41.996
Aren't you going
to come with me?

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.798
Absolutely not!

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:22.870
Seriously? Jello?

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.572
It's firm, but not too hard.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:26.341
Your dog won't like it.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:30.645
You must make a fresh belly
each night or it will get soggy.

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:35.983
What do I say to Danny?

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:38.386
Why don't you tell him
the truth?

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.494
Hey.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:47.595
Are you ok?

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.496
Me? What?

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:51.766
Yeah. I'm good.

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:54.068
Oh, ok.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.870
Good.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.409
Cravings.

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:05.380
Hmm.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:06.914
Hey, um...

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.483
I'm sorry about last night.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:12.987
Nah, it's...

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:16.457
so did you want to reschedule?

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:18.626
Even just grab a quick bite
after my shift?

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.696
Shit, I actually have a birthing
class tonight.

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:23.498
Ah.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:23.931
You know what?

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:24.799
Fuck it.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.167
I'll play hooky this week.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:27.502
No, no.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:28.836
You have to go to your class.

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.155
Why?

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:33.473
Because it can really affect
your birthing experience.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.877
Right.

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.745
Tell you what.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.915
I'll take you to your class,
we'll eat after.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.451
Honestly, the class is kind
of lame.

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:46.187
Ruth, I want to.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.156
Really.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.694
It looks like we're
a little early.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.996
Let's wait in here.

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:58.666
I'm scared of the other women.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:00.435
Ok.

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:04.439
Ah, dinner of champions.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.107
Alright.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.878
Finding your flower power.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.115
My friends enrolled me.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.016
That I met at the store?

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.184
Mmmhmm.

01:14:16.186 --> 01:14:17.585
Where do you know them from?

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.954
High school.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.123
That's great that
you're all still tight.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.891
Mmmhmm.

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:27.728
I'm not sure how much we have
in common anymore.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.764
They're all married with kids.

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.699
Yeah, mine too.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.468
I kinda like it, though.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.236
Being Uncle Danny.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:36.971
The only thing is...

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.706
What?

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.575
Well, it's kinda tough to meet
single people

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:42.910
at Chuck-e-Cheese.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:45.213
It's not like we're gonna
hit the club.

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:48.082
I might.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:51.219
Alright.

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:52.720
You ever try online dating?

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:53.988
Oh yeah.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.891
Apparently my soul match
is unemployed perverts

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.226
from the next town over.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.929
Fun.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:03.631
Mine is "I'm ovulating, do
you want to fertilize my eggs?

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:06.067
Also, I need your answer
by the end of this date".

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.935
Run!

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:09.036
No, no.

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.136
I mean, yeah, I get it.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:13.324
That tick-tock.

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:16.510
It's just dating has kind of
become this vetting process,

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:20.615
and I kinda feel like I'm
just testes with a face.

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:24.285
Not that I'm opposed, it's
just a guy needs to be romanced

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.621
a little once in a while,
you know?

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.289
That's hilarious.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:32.927
Anyway, it's hard to be single
in your 30's.

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.795
It blows.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.831
It totally blows.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.240
Wait 'till you meet
the other ones.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:57.785
Before we begin I'd like
to welcome our new face

01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:59.987
in the room.

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:05.326
Oh, everyone, this is Danny.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.194
Hi.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.564
Hi, Danny.

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:11.799
Is he the father?

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:12.667
Uh, no.

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:14.802
He's...

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:17.004
my boss?

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.173
Nice boss.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:26.614
Now just press the ice
to your wrists

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:30.117
and breathe through the pain.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:32.787
That's it, baby.

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:42.863
Are you kidding me?

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:54.008
Ruth, look at me.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.710
You can do this.

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.044
You are a warrior.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:58.613
You are a lioness.

01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:01.115
You two are very synchronized.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.717
Oh, this is good.

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:05.086
You are ready
for the next step.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:09.390
Now breathe together.

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:18.799
Very good.

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:25.239
You want to come
to my place after?

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.674
Yeah.

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:45.760
Oh my god, I want you so bad.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.677
Through here.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.448
Wait.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:08.115
Like this.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:10.017
Ok.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.120
Oh my god, this is so sexy.

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.089
No, no, no.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:16.857
Wait, wait.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.059
I can't do this.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:18.392
What?

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:19.060
I can't.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:19.894
Why?

01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:22.763
I just...

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.865
I don't want your penis
to poke the babies.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.001
It won't, I promise.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:29.303
No, no, their heads
could get bashed in.

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:30.271
It's not that big.

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:31.339
Trust me.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.406
No, Danny, they could see it.

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:34.275
They could get nightmares.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:37.745
I just...

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:38.212
I can't.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.014
Ok.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:40.981
Is that ok?

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.450
Yeah.

01:18:42.452 --> 01:18:44.318
Yeah, of course.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.219
I want what you want.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.188
If you could just...

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:50.024
Oh, no, no, that's...

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.158
thank you.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:51.792
Are you sure?

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:52.827
Yeah.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:58.365
So that was the bedroom,
obviously.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:03.237
Here we have kitchen, living
room, dining room, etcetera.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.173
What's this?

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:07.908
Oh.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:13.481
Uh, this was supposed to be
a nursery.

01:19:13.483 --> 01:19:16.984
I bought this place
with my wife... ex-wife,

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:21.489
with the intention
of starting a family, but...

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:24.391
But what?

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.327
After three years of trying
to conceive unsuccessfully,

01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:29.797
I found birth control pills
in her purse.

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:32.099
What did you do?

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.268
I divorced her.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.303
Because she didn't want kids?

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.538
No.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.374
Because she deceived me.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:45.813
Ruth, I like you.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:48.115
A lot.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.418
I think we were meant to meet.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.523
Look, I don't want
to scare you,

01:19:55.525 --> 01:19:57.091
but I really have this feeling

01:19:57.093 --> 01:20:01.428
like we could have
a life together.

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.285
I want out.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:27.805
<i>Pedro!</i>

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.328
Uh, let me think of something.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.298
You go now before she comes
and cuts the balls off.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:55.449
Ruth?

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:56.884
Am I waking you?

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:58.586
No, I wish.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:00.321
So what's going on?

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:06.360
Ruth, do you want to come
to my concert?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.528
For sure.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:08.629
Back to bed.

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:10.965
I'm the tree.

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:12.299
That's wicked.

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:13.868
You ok?

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.369
Bed.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:22.209
Deb, I can't do this anymore.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:26.380
I can't be...

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.917
pregnant.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:31.552
Yeah you can.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.021
The last month is hard.

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:38.993
Would you guys even like me
if I wasn't going to be a mom?

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.961
Of course.

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:46.934
Deb...

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:56.277
Oh yeah, my cast disappeared.

01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:59.614
Nothing else taken.

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:02.950
It must have been some stupid
teenage prank.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:05.252
Unbelievable.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.354
Yeah.

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:24.038
Thanks!

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.552
Will you please tell me
what is going on?

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:41.422
Something, I've got something
to show you, ok?

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:44.024
Just wait.

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:47.428
Here, here.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.129
Are you Pedro or whatever?

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.064
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:51.532
Sit, sit.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:56.403
Look.

01:22:56.405 --> 01:23:00.607
If you want my baby, it's
going to be a thousand bucks.

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:02.309
Cash.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.311
In tens and twenties.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:08.082
Wow.

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:15.089
Is there a problem?

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:16.223
Uh...

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:17.458
where to begin?

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:23.097
Um, for starters she's black!

01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:24.999
Not even like chocolate milk,
like the night!

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:26.700
Are you a racist or something?

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:27.735
No.

01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:30.137
Because I don't smoke crack.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:32.039
Never crossed my mind.

01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:35.142
I don't want my baby going
to no racist.

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:38.045
I'm not a racist, I just don't
want a baby.

01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:38.746
A black baby.

01:23:38.748 --> 01:23:42.049
No, any baby.

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:44.351
And anyway, I'm having twins,
remember?

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.486
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:46.620
One down, one to go.

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:47.755
Ok, seriously.

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:50.057
Pedro? You need to lay
off the ganja.

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:52.309
Oh.

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:54.560
Oh, so 'cause he's Mexican,
now he does illegal drugs?

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:56.430
He does do illegal drugs.

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.399
Typical white supremacist.

01:23:58.401 --> 01:24:00.234
I am not a white supremacist.

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:08.375
Look.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.612
Promise me you will not sell
this baby.

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:13.898
Why?

01:24:13.899 --> 01:24:16.183
Because it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

01:24:16.185 --> 01:24:19.219
Seriously. Give
him or her up for adoption.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:21.755
You will be someone's angel.

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:26.360
Promise.

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:27.394
Ok.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.113
Ok.

01:24:29.114 --> 01:24:30.831
And hey, no more
drinking coffee.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.466
No.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:37.404
Where did you even find her?

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.639
I was only trying to help you.

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:41.809
Yeah, well it was really weird,
Pedro.

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:45.746
Faking the pregnancy
is really weird.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:49.516
You know, I have a cousin
in Mexico.

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:51.585
You could go down there
and say you had the baby.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.220
Go to Mexico?

01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:54.855
Si.

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:01.762
What have I done?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.141
I gotta tell them.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.190
Danny.

01:25:30.192 --> 01:25:34.828
Can we go somewhere and talk?

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.463
Uh oh.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:40.667
That's break-up face.

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:41.468
Listen, Ruth.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.738
Don't do this, alright?

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.808
I understand why you think
you can't see me right now.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.844
You're about to be a mother
of two, and that's big.

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:52.579
It's huge.

01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:53.780
And now is not the time
in your life

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:57.851
where you should be dating.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:26:01.455
So why don't you just marry me?

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:04.258
Listen.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.494
I want to take care of you, ok?

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.730
All of you.

01:26:15.304 --> 01:26:18.305
Danny, I haven't been honest
with you.

01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:22.242
<i>I knew you were full of shit!</i>

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:24.411
You are such a liar.

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:26.346
I figured out
your little secret.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:27.814
Danny, it was just a mistake.

01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:30.951
I knew the father could not be
a doctor.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:33.520
It's him!

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.589
The stock boy.

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:39.259
I am technically a doctor, too.

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.395
Oh my god.

01:26:41.397 --> 01:26:43.363
Of course it is.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:44.298
How could I be so blind?

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.666
That makes sense.

01:26:45.668 --> 01:26:46.867
Everything makes sense.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:48.535
That's why you're always
defending him,

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.370
all the whispering
in the staff room.

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:51.572
You're in love with him.

01:26:51.574 --> 01:26:53.674
I am not in love with Pedro.

01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:54.775
And you!

01:26:54.777 --> 01:26:55.776
You're a married man.

01:26:55.778 --> 01:26:56.843
How many kids do you have?

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:57.578
Four?

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.879
No, no, no. Five.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:01.481
Do you have any idea
how many guys would kill

01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:03.717
to have what you have?

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.952
You've got a big, beautiful
family,

01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:06.320
and you still go looking
for more?

01:27:06.322 --> 01:27:08.722
You greedy piss ant.

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.991
I'm no piss ant,
this is Ruth's deal.

01:27:10.993 --> 01:27:12.626
Danny, just stop.

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:14.260
At least have the balls
to own up to your situation

01:27:14.263 --> 01:27:15.762
you son of a bitch.

01:27:18.968 --> 01:27:20.701
Ruth!

01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:21.535
Don't touch me.

01:27:21.537 --> 01:27:22.769
Alright, easy.

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:25.606
Alright.

01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:29.276
I'm really sorry, we're
going to get you taken care of.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:30.611
Oh, Jesus.

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:31.945
Uh, doctor, she's pregnant
and she fell.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:32.613
Me?

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:33.480
No, no.

01:27:33.482 --> 01:27:34.514
Stretcher please.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.033
I'm fine, seriously.

01:27:36.034 --> 01:27:37.551
It's just my buddy Pedro
that you need to see.

01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:38.452
What?

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:39.019
What're you doing?

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:39.820
What're you doing?

01:27:39.822 --> 01:27:40.621
Easy.

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:41.755
What the fuck?

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:42.856
Put me down!

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:44.558
Let's go.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.796
Hey, can I get a tissue?

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:52.115
Seriously?

01:27:52.116 --> 01:27:54.433
Honestly, I am completely
100 percent fine.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.370
Yes, well we still need to check
the baby's heart beat.

01:27:56.372 --> 01:27:57.404
Just get an ultrasound-

01:27:57.406 --> 01:27:57.971
No, you don't.

01:27:57.973 --> 01:27:58.739
I barely even fell.

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:00.085
She fell, alright.

01:28:00.086 --> 01:28:01.430
There were cans everywhere.

01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:03.391
You can't do this,
this is my body.

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:15.455
I'll need the room now, please.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:16.923
Danny, just go home.

01:28:16.925 --> 01:28:18.805
Not until I know what
the doctor-

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.601
Just go home.

01:28:27.603 --> 01:28:29.069
I'll explain everything
to you later.

01:28:29.071 --> 01:28:31.505
I promise.

01:28:37.046 --> 01:28:39.012
Ok.

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.686
Oh.

01:28:45.688 --> 01:28:47.087
It's pseudocyesis.

01:28:47.089 --> 01:28:48.488
Commonly known as
the phantom preg-

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:49.056
Shh.

01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:50.957
Out, ok? Please?

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:01.968
This is a very
serious situation.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.804
You get that?

01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:09.226
Listen.

01:29:09.227 --> 01:29:10.910
We have people here in the
hospital that can help you.

01:29:10.913 --> 01:29:13.513
I'm not crazy.

01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:39.139
Move it along, jag-off.

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:45.512
Danny...

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:46.446
<i>Ruth, listen.</i>

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:48.682
<i>The house is flooding.</i>

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.917
<i>I was running myself a bubble</i>
<i>bath and I got locked out.</i>

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:51.985
<i>I need your key.</i>

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:53.120
What about the spare?

01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:55.389
<i>I can't find the stupid thing.</i>

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.657
<i>Ruth, my insurance is not</i>
<i>going to cover this,</i>

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.093
<i>so dammit, get over here!</i>

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:02.696
Alright, I'm coming.

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:21.548
What the heck took you so long?

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.953
Open the door.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.296
Come on.

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:37.663
Ok, alright, I don't-

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:38.414
: Surprise!

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:46.640
Ruth, I've never seen you
speechless before!

01:30:46.642 --> 01:30:47.874
We didn't get you a piñata.

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:49.776
You're too dangerous.

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.950
Wow.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:00.454
Um, well, listen up.

01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:04.791
I just want to tell you all
how great it's been watching.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.560
Ruthie grow during
this pregnancy,

01:31:06.562 --> 01:31:08.762
and I'm not just talking around.

01:31:12.501 --> 01:31:14.901
You've changed,
matured into this...

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:20.140
I don't know, beautiful woman,
and I love you and I just,

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:23.176
I guess I couldn't be
any more proud.

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.750
Oh god.

01:31:30.752 --> 01:31:33.153
I uh...

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:35.155
I have uh...

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:38.592
something that I need to say.

01:31:38.594 --> 01:31:39.993
Tell.

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:42.762
Everyone, and uh...

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:45.098
um...

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.200
it's not good.

01:31:47.202 --> 01:31:50.770
Ruth, are you ok?

01:31:50.772 --> 01:31:51.605
She's bleeding.

01:31:51.607 --> 01:31:54.674
It's not blood.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.642
Oh my god, sit.

01:31:55.644 --> 01:31:56.827
Sit down.

01:31:56.828 --> 01:31:58.011
She almost miscarried
once before.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.579
And she slipped yesterday.

01:31:59.581 --> 01:32:00.947
I'm fine.

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:03.850
What's happening?

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:05.886
Uh, her placenta just
fully fell out.

01:32:05.888 --> 01:32:07.687
Ruth, let me see, ok?

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:08.688
I'm going to call an ambulance.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:09.656
No, please, just stop.

01:32:09.658 --> 01:32:12.526
Everyone, just let me speak.

01:32:12.528 --> 01:32:13.527
What...

01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:15.195
the...

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:17.297
hell...

01:32:17.299 --> 01:32:17.799
¶¶¶

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:28.043

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:38.153
¶¶¶

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:47.961
Holy shit!

01:32:55.671 --> 01:32:58.104
It's fucking Jell-o!

01:33:05.047 --> 01:33:06.646
Dad?!

01:33:10.352 --> 01:33:11.151
Are you calling?

01:33:11.153 --> 01:33:12.686
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:27.927
Oh, you had your baby!

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:30.196
Congratulations!

01:34:30.198 --> 01:34:34.134
Oh, where is the little bundle
of joy?

01:34:34.136 --> 01:34:37.804
There is no baby.

01:34:37.806 --> 01:34:43.877
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

01:34:43.879 --> 01:34:49.983
There never was a baby.

01:34:49.985 --> 01:34:52.752
I made the baby up.

01:35:27.856 --> 01:35:32.959
Oh, you poor thing.

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:34.327
It's ok.

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:37.464
It's ok.

01:35:37.466 --> 01:35:39.733
It's ok.

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:40.235
¶

01:35:49.778 --> 01:35:50.278
¶

01:35:59.821 --> 01:36:03.456
I know I told you to clean up
the cigarettes, but...

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:05.391
what the hell is this?

01:36:05.393 --> 01:36:07.861
It's time.

01:36:09.765 --> 01:36:12.265
Time.

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:13.767
I'm sorry, dad.

01:36:13.769 --> 01:36:16.970
I know how badly
you wanted grandkids.

01:36:23.345 --> 01:36:26.312
I just want you to be happy.

01:36:35.257 --> 01:36:37.891
You want some help with this
or something?

01:36:37.893 --> 01:36:39.125
Are you fucking serious?

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:40.994
Yes, I'm fucking serious.

01:36:57.179 --> 01:37:02.282
Why'd you do it?

01:37:02.284 --> 01:37:04.417
I guess I just wanted to see
what it was like to be you

01:37:04.419 --> 01:37:07.187
for five minutes.

01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:10.356
To be perfect.

01:37:10.358 --> 01:37:14.160
Perfect?

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:20.466
I just found out officially
barren as a brick.

01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:24.070
I can't wait to tell dad.

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:33.446
There's other ways.

01:37:33.448 --> 01:37:36.282
Adoption lists are, like, years.

01:37:36.284 --> 01:37:38.902
So unless you know somebody

01:37:38.903 --> 01:37:41.521
that just wants to give
away their baby.

01:38:21.029 --> 01:38:22.929
You can finish it.

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.540
Oh, Ruth!

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:34.941
Oh my god, we are so pretending
to be pregnant

01:38:34.943 --> 01:38:36.409
to get out of gym.

01:38:49.491 --> 01:38:52.525
Danny, he has to go back
to the head office.

01:39:07.676 --> 01:39:11.678
What day is it?

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.513
Today is Friday.

01:39:13.515 --> 01:39:16.349
No, today is Thursday.

01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.518
It's Friday.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.386
Fuck!

01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:08.534
See, mom?

01:40:08.536 --> 01:40:10.570
I told you.

01:40:15.143 --> 01:40:17.744
How dare you show up here?

01:40:17.746 --> 01:40:21.147
After you lied, for months

01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:24.350
about carrying another life
inside of you?

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:28.021
You broke into Deb's
like a gangster.

01:40:28.023 --> 01:40:30.356
You made a mockery of
the most sacred experience

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:32.492
a woman can have.

01:40:32.494 --> 01:40:34.293
Am I a joke to you?

01:40:34.295 --> 01:40:37.163
Are we all jokes to you?

01:40:37.165 --> 01:40:39.332
And just to be clear,

01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:41.667
we didn't dump you because
you weren't a mom.

01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:43.536
We dumped you
because you behaved

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:45.471
like an immature a-hole.

01:40:45.473 --> 01:40:46.372
Ok Shannon, take it easy.

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:48.207
No, no. It's ok.

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:50.476
She's right.

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:52.445
I get it.

01:40:52.447 --> 01:40:54.680
I totally get it.

01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:02.922
Hey, if um...

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:07.159
if any of you ever need, like,
a babysitter or anything,

01:41:07.162 --> 01:41:08.728
I'm game.

01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:17.837
Everything's so boring
when Ruth's not around.

01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:21.240
Ruth!

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:24.143
Thanks for coming.

01:41:24.145 --> 01:41:26.279
Deb.

01:41:34.689 --> 01:41:36.689
Effective immediately
we are implementing

01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:39.092
a store-wide policy prohibiting
the use of personal items

01:41:39.094 --> 01:41:42.762
and outside paraphernalia
in individual work stations.

01:41:42.764 --> 01:41:48.568
The uh... um...

01:41:48.570 --> 01:41:50.636
give me five.

01:41:56.244 --> 01:41:59.412
You know the timing of my
transfer wasn't a coincidence?

01:41:59.414 --> 01:42:01.681
Can we go somewhere and talk?

01:42:01.683 --> 01:42:03.483
Still on for lunch today?

01:42:03.485 --> 01:42:05.184
You bet.

01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:08.888
You should go.

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:11.224
Danny, please.

01:42:11.226 --> 01:42:14.894
Look, I know I deceived you just
like your lousy ex-wife did,

01:42:14.896 --> 01:42:17.396
but I never meant to lie
to you.

01:42:17.398 --> 01:42:20.199
Ok, no. That's not true,
that's not true.

01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:21.667
But it's when I thought you
were a douche.

01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:23.069
Oh.

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.470
And then you surprised me
when you turned out to be

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.506
this beautiful man.

01:42:26.508 --> 01:42:28.574
Just go home.

01:42:28.576 --> 01:42:30.543
Sort out your issues.

01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:44.290
No. Dude!

01:42:44.292 --> 01:42:45.808
What the-

01:42:45.809 --> 01:42:47.325
I'm not the only
one with issues, ok?

01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:49.262
You used me!

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:51.197
You pretended to like me
to fulfill some fantasy

01:42:51.199 --> 01:42:52.465
of having a family.

01:42:52.467 --> 01:42:53.799
That is-

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:04.377
You wouldn't have looked twice
at me if I wasn't pregnant.

01:43:04.379 --> 01:43:07.647
Alright, yeah.
Maybe that's true.

01:43:07.649 --> 01:43:13.853
But I liked what I saw.

01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:19.592
I was falling in love with you.

01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:22.328
You said that you thought
we were meant to meet,

01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:30.330
and even though that is super
cheese ball, I believe that.

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:34.207
I miss you.

01:43:34.209 --> 01:43:37.877
And your replacement manager
at the store has wicked b.o.

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:45.351
Danny Dictator,

01:43:45.353 --> 01:43:51.424
will you please go out
on one date with me?

01:43:51.426 --> 01:43:53.226
I don't know.

01:43:53.228 --> 01:43:56.662
I'm not feeling that good,
and I have birthing class-

01:44:25.827 --> 01:44:26.792
Ok.

01:44:47.315 --> 01:44:49.548
Well.

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:52.385
What do you think the chances
are I get to second base?

01:44:52.387 --> 01:44:54.687
On this date?

01:44:54.689 --> 01:44:56.889
Very good.

01:44:56.891 --> 01:45:01.861
I would say at least
second base.

01:45:01.863 --> 01:45:03.963
Well, in that case, ok.

01:45:03.965 --> 01:45:09.869
Yeah. I'll give you one date.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.893
Oh, you think so, do you?

01:45:33.895 --> 01:45:36.362
You think so?

01:45:36.364 --> 01:45:37.663
Ugh, you got me!

01:45:40.535 --> 01:45:41.667
Ok, let me try.

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:42.868
Let me try.

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:44.070
Get in the corner.

01:45:44.072 --> 01:45:47.773
You, come here. Come here.

01:45:47.775 --> 01:45:49.408
Ok, who's next?

01:45:55.583 --> 01:45:56.716
Hey Libby, knock knock.

01:45:56.718 --> 01:45:57.817
Who's there?

01:45:57.819 --> 01:45:59.085
Interrupting cow.

01:45:59.087 --> 01:45:59.852
Interrupt-

01:45:59.854 --> 01:46:01.554
Moo!

01:46:01.556 --> 01:46:03.956
Moo!

01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:05.791
Oh, I'm light headed,
I need to sit down.

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:06.793
I'll be right back.

01:46:06.794 --> 01:46:07.993
I'll change her.

01:46:07.995 --> 01:46:08.861
You sure?

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:10.396
Yeah.

01:46:11.099 --> 01:46:14.700
Hi! Oh, god, that is gross.

01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:16.035
Nope, can't do it.

01:46:16.037 --> 01:46:17.970
Here, I'll take her.

01:46:19.841 --> 01:46:20.706
Come on, girl.

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:22.441
Thanks, dad.

01:46:26.948 --> 01:46:29.548
That baby looked good on you.
