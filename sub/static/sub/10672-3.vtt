That's quite a list, friend.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.294
Oh, now,
you needn't fear me.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.196
I remember you,

00:31.198 --> 00:33.766
you're the guy who used me
as bait for those Autobots!

00:33.768 --> 00:37.202
And I feel just terrible
about that.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.473
I was misled by a powerful,
but deceitful, Decepticon.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.743
I'm glad I now have
the chance to apologize.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.245
In person.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.715
Apology not accepted.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.151
Let me make it up to you,
brother.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.453
I want to assemble
a different team,

00:54.455 --> 00:56.255
a better team.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.458
Join me, and together
we can take over Earth,

00:59.460 --> 01:02.528
and make it a homeworld
for our kind!

01:02.530 --> 01:03.729
( scoffs )

01:03.731 --> 01:06.398
No dice.
I'm on a new team.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.400
Do tell.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.736
They appreciated me
from the start.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.505
So pardon me while I kick
your offer to the curb!

What you got there,
kiddo?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.792
I found this display case
in the scrapyard.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.860
Ah, it's perfect!

02:08.863 --> 02:11.330
Since when do you need
a display case?

02:11.332 --> 02:14.333
Well, since Bumblebee and
the other Autobots arrived.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.201
I've been saving trophies
from our missions.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.271
Hmm. A crushed
popcorn container?

02:19.273 --> 02:22.774
I found it when we captured
Terrashock in the museum!

02:22.776 --> 02:25.811
And this hunk of metal
fell off Fracture, remember?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.814
You've collected memorabilia
from all our missions?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.316
Trophies.
I'm not a collector.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.318
But it's
a big display case,

02:33.320 --> 02:35.554
so I'm gonna need
to fill it out.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.890
Heh, of course.

02:37.892 --> 02:41.293
STRONGARM:
Okay, Grim,
it's a team-building drill.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.830
First, we need to avoid those
pedestrians in the street,

02:44.832 --> 02:47.499
then we jump over
that whirlpool,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.401
and finally duck under

02:49.403 --> 02:52.604
that bridge swarming
with innocent bystanders.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.840
Sideswipe and I trained
every day on this course.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.876
Our record was nine seconds.
Think we can beat it?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.712
Heh, Autobot, please.

03:00.714 --> 03:04.783
Great, so while I move
those pedestrians to safety,

03:04.785 --> 03:07.286
you follow the path
I create, and--

03:07.288 --> 03:09.388
Huh? Grim!

03:09.390 --> 03:11.356
( dramatic theme playing )

03:26.839 --> 03:29.208
Did we beat the record?

03:29.210 --> 03:30.943
Well, let's see.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.679
You ran over
several pedestrians,

03:33.681 --> 03:35.547
you were sucked
into a whirlpool,

03:35.549 --> 03:37.683
and you destroyed a bridge.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.585
So...that's a yes?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.420
Grimlock,

03:41.422 --> 03:43.388
helping out Drift,
Optimus and Windblade,

03:43.390 --> 03:46.225
we're gonna have to work
together really closely.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.560
This exercise
is about teamwork!

03:48.562 --> 03:50.963
Aren't we already
teammates?

03:50.965 --> 03:53.966
Yes, but we need
to work in sync too.

03:53.968 --> 03:57.636
You have to know what I'm
gonna do before I even do it.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.705
Because that's so easy.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.441

Have you guys seen my Billy
The Breakfast Beaver figures?

from a quarry

where I'm also detecting
unusual seismic activity.

Want us to tag along,

No need to put you two
in danger.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.808
If the quarry is abandoned,
there won't be any humans

04:36.810 --> 04:39.878
there to deal with.

Can you bring me

Absolutely!

What do you suppose
he's doing?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.068
Maybe he just likes
to smash stuff!

05:03.070 --> 05:05.070
It's not like
he needs a reason.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.805
I know I don't.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.075
No, that 'Con definitely
has an agenda.

He seems to be collecting
that orange ore.

your jurisdiction, Autobots.

Wouldn't you say?
Ha-ha-ha.

for a test of mettle!

Like I said,
we're not here for sport.

09:16.790 --> 09:20.091
Pity. I would finish all three

to my mission.

Why do you suppose these rocks
are so important to him?

Fixit, sending video

You didn't explain it!

Sideswipe would've
just known.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.832
Why does that
sound familiar?

10:00.834 --> 10:03.301
FIXIT:
When smelted with other
Cybertronian metals,

10:03.303 --> 10:06.304
Thermatanium becomes highly
resistant to heat and pressure,

10:06.306 --> 10:08.306
creating an alloy
that's often used

10:08.308 --> 10:10.308
in the hulls of starships
like the Alchemor.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.910
Thermatanium--

10:11.912 --> 10:13.645
Is not a trophy.

Not yet.

Lieutenant, I'm detecting

10:18.318 --> 10:20.318
Looks like
he's headed to

10:20.320 --> 10:22.187
the same steel mill
where Steeljaw

10:22.189 --> 10:23.655

It's after hours,

didn't get the memo?

needed to be shortened.

melt down that Thermatanium.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.978
It's stuck in your...
Uh-oh.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.980
Ah, really?

13:01.982 --> 13:06.317
Finally,
it's just you and me!

13:06.319 --> 13:07.519
( grunts )

13:07.521 --> 13:09.387
( both grunt )

13:09.389 --> 13:11.322
Have at thee.

13:11.324 --> 13:15.260
This doesn't look good.
I know!

13:15.262 --> 13:17.195
He's gonna melt down
all the Thermatanium

13:17.197 --> 13:18.930
before I can grab any!

13:18.932 --> 13:20.532
Now's not the best time

13:20.534 --> 13:22.801
to be thinking about
a souvenir, son.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.270
We have to keep our heads
in the game.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.272
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

13:29.542 --> 13:33.244
That would make
an even more awesome trophy!

13:37.516 --> 13:39.250
( weapons clanging )

13:39.252 --> 13:41.553
Aw, score!

13:43.455 --> 13:46.491
Surrender now,
Decepticon!

13:46.493 --> 13:49.294
Ugh. Not a chance!

13:49.296 --> 13:50.895
It's only a matter of time

13:50.897 --> 13:53.364
before I locate
your fatal weakness.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.566
Hyah!

(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

13:58.938 --> 14:00.138
( grunts )

14:07.146 --> 14:08.346
Russell?

14:09.281 --> 14:12.083
And there it is.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.386
( grunts )

14:16.622 --> 14:19.424
( grunting ):
No!

Don't hurt him!
Let him go!

14:26.465 --> 14:27.866
( grunts )

14:29.335 --> 14:31.636
Put the human down.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.574
I disagree.

14:36.576 --> 14:40.912
This squishy prevents you
from attacking me.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.914
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

14:50.956 --> 14:54.626
Yes, yes, into
the viaduct, Autobot.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.395
Or the human
will be exterminated.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.197
Bee, don't do it!

15:05.070 --> 15:08.106
I did as you ordered.
Now let the human go.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.507
Business
first!

15:09.509 --> 15:12.076
Your interference
has delayed my mission.

15:12.078 --> 15:16.080
Time to end our match
for good!

15:19.385 --> 15:21.386
(<i> suspenseful theme continues</i> )

15:25.257 --> 15:27.292
Scrap.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.664
( grunting )

15:32.666 --> 15:35.533
Even were you to somehow
climb out, dear rival,

15:35.535 --> 15:38.002
I'd only deposit
you back in.

15:38.004 --> 15:41.606
I'll be staying
to make certain of your demise.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.108
( both grunting )

15:44.110 --> 15:48.012
Huh? Do you think you can...
Maybe.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.681
( Strongarm grunts )

15:49.683 --> 15:51.983
Scrud!

15:57.022 --> 15:58.423
( laughs )

15:58.425 --> 16:00.992
Take solace in the fact
that you were defeated

16:00.994 --> 16:03.695
by a true warrior!
And a gentle-con.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.130
( all grunt and groan )

16:06.132 --> 16:08.099
Russell!

16:10.569 --> 16:12.637
You dare strike me?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.706
You are either
undeniably brave,

16:14.708 --> 16:17.075
or oh so foolish!

16:17.077 --> 16:19.043
I'm gonna go with
the first one.

16:19.045 --> 16:22.113
Like we discussed. Ready?
Ready!

16:27.252 --> 16:30.655
Ugh, aah,
unhand me, you oaf!

16:33.025 --> 16:34.258
STRONGARM:
Lieutenant!

16:35.728 --> 16:37.328
( both grunt )

16:37.330 --> 16:38.730
Thanks, Strongarm.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.502
( both grunting )

16:45.237 --> 16:46.437
( screams )

16:46.439 --> 16:48.139
Grim, no!
Not through the...

16:53.245 --> 16:55.780
Gone.
Sorry about that.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.549
I guess I'll never be--
It's okay, Grim.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.652
Sideswipe and I made
plenty of mistakes at first.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.189
We'll get better as a team
and we <i> will</i> get our 'Con.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.723
DENNY:
Son, are you hurt?

17:06.726 --> 17:10.461
Broken bones, sprains,
contusions, hangnails?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.664
Yeah, just a little rip
in my jacket.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.134
Sorry I got
in the way, Bee.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.069
I'm just glad
you're okay.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.070
And I'm glad you two
are finally in sync.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.407
Grim was right. We need
to work together as we are,

17:23.410 --> 17:25.710
not as Sideswipe
and I used to be.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.346
But we're off to a pretty
good start!
Ugh!

17:28.348 --> 17:30.148
I guess your mystery 'Con
will have to remain

17:30.150 --> 17:31.616
a mystery for now.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.085
I suspect
we'll cross paths again,

17:34.087 --> 17:37.688
especially if he's building
a starship somewhere.

DENNY:
Sorry you couldn't bring back
a trophy this time,

18:10.657 --> 18:13.658
but to tell you the truth,
I'm just glad you came back.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.861
Heh, that makes
two of us.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.863
(<i> mellow theme playing</i> )

18:26.271 --> 18:28.639
It took some doing,
but I've remotely accessed

18:28.641 --> 18:30.641
a Cybertronian database
through a computer

18:30.643 --> 18:32.410
in one of Windblade's
caches,

18:32.412 --> 18:35.413
and I think I've identified
our Decepticon!

( computer beeping )

18:37.851 --> 18:40.184
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

18:45.591 --> 18:47.425
His name is Saberhorn.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.693
That's him!

18:48.695 --> 18:50.461
He was the leader
of a pirate crew

18:50.463 --> 18:51.896
that raided
cargo starships

18:51.898 --> 18:54.465
until he was captured
and placed aboard the...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.134
Wait, what?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.669
( stammers ):
This is im-im-im-im-im--

18:58.671 --> 19:00.404
Impossible!

19:00.406 --> 19:02.740
It says here that
Saberhorn was apprehended

19:02.742 --> 19:05.176
and placed aboard...
the Alchemor?

19:05.178 --> 19:06.377
Huh?
( gasps )

19:06.379 --> 19:07.578
( gasps )

19:09.281 --> 19:12.316
But my manifest listed
no such Decepticon!

19:12.318 --> 19:16.254
So who <i> is</i> this Saberhorn?
And where did he come from?

19:16.256 --> 19:21.259
More importantly,
when do I get to punch him?

Howdy, bolt-brains.
I'll just let myself in...

Hey, you don't
let me pass,

are gonna be angry.

They love me.

Get in here now,
you rust-brained coward!

Heh, always teasing. Oof!

I found everything
on your list.

This will do.

No pat on the back?

No promotion?
Don't I get anything?

Very generous!

Oh, and they say
you two aren't givers, heh!

failure and that buffoon...

we have, Glowstrike.

we could rely upon.
