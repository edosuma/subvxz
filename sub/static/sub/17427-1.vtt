02:46.800 --> 02:50.310
- Oh, disgusting.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.710
- Pumpkin guts, I love
the way they feel.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.010
I wanna fill up an entire
bathtub full of pumpkin guts

02:56.050 --> 02:57.910
and roll around in it.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.420
- That's nasty.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.350
- That'd be awesome.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.350
- You guys are saving
the seeds, right?

03:04.390 --> 03:05.320
- Yeah.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.520
You know how to cook them?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.590
- Yeah, you put
them in the oven.

03:08.630 --> 03:11.030
- Don't you have to
season them or something?

03:11.060 --> 03:12.730
- With what?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.730
- I don't know, brown sugar?

03:15.770 --> 03:18.470
- Just salt, like, uh,
with sunflower seeds.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.870
- That makes sense.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.540
So Mel, all your mom's got
is three types of vodka,

03:22.570 --> 03:23.740
is this one cool?

03:23.770 --> 03:24.970
- Whatever.

03:25.010 --> 03:26.710
- Your mom doesn't care
that we drink her booze?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.350
- Just fill it
back up with water.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.480
She doesn't drink that crap.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.820
It's been here
since my dad left.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.820
- Where's Amber tonight?

03:35.850 --> 03:38.020
- Please, you think the warden's

03:38.050 --> 03:40.890
gonna let her out of the
house on a school night?

03:40.920 --> 03:44.630
Probably forcing her to
take communion as we speak.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.760
Speaking of which.

03:47.930 --> 03:50.470
Oh!
- What the Hell?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.740
Megan!

03:52.770 --> 03:55.070
- It's vodka-flavored water.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.840
- Oh, looks like I already
got to that bottle.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.340
- Ugh.

04:00.380 --> 04:01.780
- Grab another one.

04:01.810 --> 04:03.580
Hell, if my mom doesn't know
that one has water in them,

04:03.610 --> 04:06.920
she certainly won't
notice both of 'em.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.520
- Who's calling?

04:11.560 --> 04:14.520
- Nate.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.660
- I didn't know
you talked to Nate.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.800
- Yeah, we've been
talking a lot lately.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.630
- You gonna answer it?

04:21.670 --> 04:25.070
- I'll call him back.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.070
- I love Nate, nice guy.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.440
- Who do you love?

04:28.470 --> 04:29.970
- Nate Summers

04:32.140 --> 04:33.980
What?

04:34.010 --> 04:35.680
How can
you not like Nate?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.080
Everybody loves Nate.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.650
- He's the nicest
guy in the world.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.550
- He's kind of a girl.

04:41.590 --> 04:44.820
I don't know, he's just so.

04:45.990 --> 04:48.760
- What the Hell is that?

04:48.790 --> 04:51.430
- He's a pussy, totally gay.

04:51.460 --> 04:52.630
- He is not.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.430
- Definitely got
some gay tendencies.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.700
- Like what?

04:55.730 --> 04:58.970
- Like, like being all nice.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.440
- He's gay because he's nice?

05:01.470 --> 05:03.770
- Straight guys are never nice.

05:03.810 --> 05:05.780
- The idiots that you
date are not nice.

05:05.810 --> 05:07.940
Normal guys are nice.

05:07.980 --> 05:12.080
- If by normal you mean gay,
then I completely agree.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.780
If a guy likes you,
he's not gonna be nice.

05:14.820 --> 05:17.920
- I think you're still
in the third grade.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.860
- So if he pulls my
pigtails he likes me?

05:20.890 --> 05:22.590
- Oh my God, that's
why Tyler was chaing me

05:22.630 --> 05:24.460
around the playground trying
to put gum in my hair?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.730
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

05:26.760 --> 05:28.870
- Laugh it up, bitches
- I think it's still in there.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.870
- Don't cry to me when
you're dating Nate

05:31.900 --> 05:34.970
and you catch him
playing explore my body

05:35.000 --> 05:36.740
with Coach Van Lanning.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.480
- Eww.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.810
- Well, anyway, cheers, bitches.

05:46.150 --> 05:51.150
Uh, now that's good stuff.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.160
Ignoring you.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.470
- Are you done yet?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.810
- Just about.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.840
- Your thing better look like
the Mona Lisa, or something,

06:12.880 --> 06:16.810
because you are the
slowest cunkin parver.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.150
Cunkin parver?

06:21.820 --> 06:24.150
- Pumpkin carver.

06:24.190 --> 06:26.920
- Anyway, cunkin parver,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.230
I am done.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.690
Finally.

06:30.730 --> 06:32.730
- Got candles?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.440
- Thank you.

06:45.910 --> 06:48.480
So cool.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.750
My lid, please.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.750
- Lid
- Thank you.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.590
- Ooh.

06:56.620 --> 06:57.690
- You guys ready?

06:57.720 --> 06:58.560
- Yes.

06:58.590 --> 07:00.790
- One, two, three.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.230
- I'm an artiste.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.660
I'm gonna go to a school
for cunkin parving.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.530
- You shut your big asshole.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.610
Perfect timing.

07:18.710 --> 07:21.580
- No kidding, talk
about dramatic effects.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.510
- Oh shit, my mom's home.

07:24.550 --> 07:26.620
- Oh, my God.

07:26.650 --> 07:27.850
- Feel free to help.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.190
- What, I am,

07:29.220 --> 07:33.560
I'm making sure the
pumpkins look perfect.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.560
So, uh, your mom's impressed.

07:35.590 --> 07:38.030
- Great, cause that helps.

07:38.060 --> 07:39.600
- What's your mom
doing out there?

07:39.630 --> 07:40.760
- What do you mean?

07:40.800 --> 07:41.970
- From the front
window it looks like

07:42.000 --> 07:44.130
she's sleeping in the car.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.600
- What?

07:54.340 --> 07:56.150
- That is her car, right?

07:56.180 --> 07:58.280
Yeah, that's her.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.850
What the Hell is she doing?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.220
Is she on her phone?

08:01.250 --> 08:04.190
- My mom doesn't
have a cell phone.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.060
- I mean, it looks like she's
asleep or something, right?

08:07.090 --> 08:09.030
Maybe she's drunk.

08:09.060 --> 08:12.200
- Yeah, my mom the lush.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.630
I'm gonna go out there.

08:15.670 --> 08:16.870
- All right, me too.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.970
- Me, too.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.620
- Mom!

08:33.650 --> 08:36.919
- Mrs. Peterson, your
greeting service has arrived.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.860
- 'Ello Madam.

08:38.890 --> 08:41.190
- Will you stop it,
what did you drink?

08:41.220 --> 08:44.560
- Mom, mom.

08:45.930 --> 08:47.800
Mom?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.870
- Oh my God.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.270
- Oh my God, let's
get in the house.

09:00.410 --> 09:02.810
- Open the door, open the door.

09:02.850 --> 09:05.680
Open the door, open the door.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.990
- Boo.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.160
- That was fucked up.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.360
- Language.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.200
It was Mom's idea.

09:22.230 --> 09:26.370
- Are you freakin' serious?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.770
- Trick or treat.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.220
- I can't believe your Mom.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.250
- Yeah, she really went all
out this year, that's for sure.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.220
- That's awesome.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.320
- Yo.
- Hey.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.330
- 'Sup.
- Hey.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.130
- So, uh, heard this one
peed her pants last night.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.200
- I did not.

09:53.230 --> 09:55.400
- I heard it wasn't just pee.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.000
- Shut up.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.670
- So what are you guys doing
after the football game?

09:58.700 --> 10:01.140
- Is Trish still throwing
her Halloween party?

10:01.170 --> 10:04.270
- Oh crap, I totally
forgot about that.

10:04.310 --> 10:05.270
Do you have a costume?

10:05.310 --> 10:07.080
- Yep, what about you guys.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.780
- Clark Kent.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.380
- Who's Clark Kent?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.180
- You don't know
who Clark Kent is?

10:13.220 --> 10:14.880
- Hence my asking.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.390
- Oh, just say Superman.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.920
- I'm not goin' as Superman,
I'm goin' as Clark Kent.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.220
Huge difference.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.160
- Superman? That's original.

10:22.190 --> 10:24.260
- Clark Kent, he's
Superman's alter ego it's--

10:24.290 --> 10:28.160
- So what about you guys?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.300
- I got a sick pirate costume.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.870
- Johnny Depp pirate or
Somalian gunboat pirate?

10:34.900 --> 10:37.340
- Now I'm rethinking it.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.780
- What about you, Ryan?

10:38.810 --> 10:41.710
- Oh you know, drunk
version of myself.

10:42.450 --> 10:43.450
- Shocking.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.980
- Always too cool, aren't you.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.320
- You know it.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.850
- Speak of the devil.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.150
- Ryan here is too cool to wear

10:51.190 --> 10:53.790
a costume to your party tonight.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.190
- Costumes are gay.

10:55.220 --> 10:59.030
- It's Halloween, and
it's a costume party.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.970
- Yep, sounds pretty gay.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.370
- OK, well, so you're
not gonna wear a costume

11:04.400 --> 11:06.170
and everybody else is?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.740
You're gonna be that guy?

11:07.770 --> 11:09.470
- Oh, don't be that guy.

11:09.510 --> 11:11.310
- You'll look like the idiot.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.810
- Not compared to
Superman over here.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.980
- All right guys, well, if I
don't see you after the game,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.820
good luck.
- Good luck.

11:18.850 --> 11:21.850
- Thanks.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.860
- Oh watch it.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.100
- Oh, yeah!

12:24.580 --> 12:26.120
- Dude, there's no way.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.280
- Just htink about it.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.250
- What are you
idiots arguing over?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.350
- Well, I was just saying
that a slutty Dorothy

12:31.390 --> 12:33.390
is way hotter than
a slutty pirate.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.520
- No way.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.860
It's a slutty pirate,
how hot is that?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.160
- I think it's hot.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.560
- Oh my God.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.170
- It's hot, but it's not
as hot as slutty Dorothy.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.470
I mean, a pirate can
be slutty, no problem.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.370
Dorothy's not
supposed to be slutty.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.410
The fact that she is slutty.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.140
Now that makes her
even more slutty.

12:53.180 --> 12:56.180
- Wow, just, wow.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.320
- Holy shit.

13:02.350 --> 13:04.450
Oh
that ain't right.

13:04.490 --> 13:07.060
- Why is it that they have
to dress so slutty anyways?

13:07.090 --> 13:08.460
I mean is there some
kind of rule or something

13:08.490 --> 13:10.560
that says girls have
to dress as whores?

13:10.590 --> 13:14.300
They can't just be Dorothy,
they've gotta be slutty Dorothy.

13:14.330 --> 13:18.100
Can't just be a pirate,

13:18.130 --> 13:21.540
they've got to be
a slutty pirate.

13:21.570 --> 13:23.610
- And you're complaining?

13:23.640 --> 13:26.910
- Fuck no, just wondering.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.280
- To Halloween, the most
spectacular, wonderful holiday,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.280
created by God himself.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.350
- Hey, I mean, if we
want, I'm sure we can

13:33.380 --> 13:36.220
get Justin to be
slutty Superman.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.320
- Clark Kent, ass.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.570
- Urban legend,
it does not exist.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.470
That same stupid story's
been floating around forever

13:56.510 --> 13:58.510
and pops up every
couple of years.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.640
People swear it's in Ohio,

14:00.680 --> 14:04.650
Detroit, Dallas, Michigan.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.650
- I heard it's about a
half-hour north of here.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.090
- Yeah, my cousin
has been there.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.020
- Retarded, both of you.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.090
- Why are they retarded now?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.290
- Have you heard of
the haunted house

14:14.320 --> 14:16.330
that you get money back for
every floor that you make it up?

14:16.360 --> 14:18.260
- And it's so
scary that nobody's

14:18.290 --> 14:19.660
ever made it all
the way through.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.160
- Yeah, I've heard of that.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.470
- It doesn't exist.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.100
- Didn't some college
kids go looking for it

14:24.130 --> 14:26.970
a couple of years ago and
they were never seen again?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.400
- I remember hearing
that people from Madison

14:28.440 --> 14:30.110
went missing on Halloween.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.610
But I didn't hear that they
went to the haunted house.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.350
- Perfect, why don't we go
find this place tonight.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.580
Right now.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.780
- Whatever.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.680
- Seriously, if you're so
sure this place doesn't exist,

14:41.720 --> 14:43.250
come prove it.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.020
- You're not driving.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.720
- No, but Nate
will, right buddy?

14:48.760 --> 14:49.660
- How'd I get pulled into this?

14:49.690 --> 14:50.660
- Come on.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.500
- You haven't been drinking?

14:52.530 --> 14:53.660
- Meh.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.500
- Why not?

14:55.530 --> 14:58.570
- I don't know, I
didn't feel like it.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.300
- I'll go with you, just
so that I can laugh at you

15:01.340 --> 15:04.710
the whole way back after
you realize you're wrong.

15:04.740 --> 15:08.180
- Bring it, Nate let's
go, Trish, you coming?

15:08.210 --> 15:10.310
- As much as I'd love to be
there when you get proved wrong,

15:10.350 --> 15:11.710
I can't leave the party.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.480
- You know what, whatever,

15:13.520 --> 15:15.350
I'm gonna call you
when we find it.

15:15.380 --> 15:18.320
- If you find it, call me,
and I'll come out there.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.320
- I thought you couldn't
leave your party.

15:20.360 --> 15:24.760
- I can't, that's how sure
I am you won't find it.

15:24.790 --> 15:25.660
- Whatever.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.300
- Megs?

15:27.330 --> 15:31.130
- No, I'm going to some musical
zombie thing with Jeremy.

15:31.170 --> 15:34.640
- Jeremy Shaver? Gross.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.670
- Whatever, he's get weed.

15:36.710 --> 15:37.510
- Nice.

15:37.540 --> 15:38.770
- Hey guys, what's up?

15:38.810 --> 15:40.210
- Road trip.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.010
- And you're coming.
- What, where?

15:42.050 --> 15:42.750
- I'll explain on the way.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.380
- I have to be home by 1:00.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.020
- It's like 10:30,
you'll be fine,

15:47.050 --> 15:48.350
and if you're a
little late, oh well.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.350
- There's no such thing
as oh well in my family.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.390
- These d-bags say it's not far.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.130
If we don't find it,
when we don't find it,

15:56.160 --> 15:58.290
we'll come right back, I
promise you won't be late.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.200
Don't make me go alone
with them, please.

16:00.230 --> 16:01.500
- You're not worried
about curfew?

16:01.530 --> 16:04.370
- I've never really had
one of those things.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.070
I hear it's kind
of a bitch, though.

16:06.100 --> 16:06.740
Let's go change.

16:06.770 --> 16:08.070
- Where are we going.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.610
- Later, losers.
- I really

16:09.640 --> 16:10.570
can't be late.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.680
Come on, it's Halloween.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.640
- It's crazy.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.580
- It's stupid.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.110
- Did someone skit over him?

16:18.150 --> 16:20.420
What's like, his deal?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.790
I've
never heard of it.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.520
- OK, that's because it
doesn't exist, people.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.060
- Bullshit, you'll see.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.460
And I'll be the first one to
make it all the way through.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.800
- Yeah, I'm sure you're the
first person to say that.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.770
Do you have any idea
where I'm goin'?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.570
- It's on some farm or
some shit somewhere.

16:42.410 --> 16:44.110
- Dude.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.640
- Dude, what?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.380
- You're not drinking in my car.

16:47.410 --> 16:50.350
- Calm down, it'll be
fine, I'll be cool.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.080
- Why is it you only drink
in my car and nobody else's?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.550
- Cause you're the
only one who allows it.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.420
- No, I don't.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.590
- Yeah.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.290
Have any
good music in here?

17:05.329 --> 17:06.560
Other than your mom's

17:06.599 --> 17:09.170
radio stations?
- Don't touch my radio.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.569
And you really have no idea?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.500
- I heard Casco.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.440
- Those two bars we just passed?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.569
That was Casco.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.210
- Maybe it's on County A.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.579
- Where's that?

17:21.609 --> 17:23.349
- Isn't that the one that's
just before the river?

17:23.380 --> 17:25.510
- I think that was like
County K or something.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.650
- Then maybe it's on
County K or something.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.120
- You don't know.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.320
- Shut up.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.160
- This is stupid,
we're turning around.

17:33.190 --> 17:34.590
- Just go a little further up.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.260
- No, I'm gonna turn it around.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.290
- Come on, just go up one
more road after this one.

17:38.330 --> 17:38.860
- You lose.

17:38.890 --> 17:42.430
- Uh, you suck.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.340
- What is that?

17:52.380 --> 17:54.880
- Holy shit.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.280
- House of Purgatory.
- I told you.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.550
- It's a haunted house
but it doesn't mean

18:00.580 --> 18:02.450
it's the one where you
get your money back.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.790
- It has to be, pull in.

18:04.820 --> 18:05.820
- I mean, is it open?

18:05.850 --> 18:07.220
Where are all the cars?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.830
- The sign is lit,
it's gotta be open.

18:18.270 --> 18:19.770
- Ooh, it's creepy.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.170
- Oh this is gonna be awesome.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.640
- Oh, calm down.

18:38.890 --> 18:42.630
- How creepy.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.730
Are we seriously
the only ones here?

18:44.760 --> 18:46.430
- We can't be.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.300
- You think nobody knows
where this place is, or what?

18:48.330 --> 18:51.230
- No, there's gotta be
other people around.

18:51.270 --> 18:54.370
- Doesn't seem like it.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.870
- Come on.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.910
- Be quick.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.480
- Sir?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.350
Sir?

19:13.590 --> 19:17.360
Uh, we were wondering
if you're still open.

19:19.030 --> 19:20.260
- Always.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.700
- Nice.

19:21.730 --> 19:22.970
And this is the haunted house
where you get money back

19:23.000 --> 19:26.800
for making it all
the way through?

19:26.840 --> 19:28.300
- Yeah.

19:28.340 --> 19:30.970
- Awesome, told you
guys it was real.

19:31.010 --> 19:32.310
Who's the man.

19:32.340 --> 19:33.440
Not you.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.350
- Go on, say it.
- Shut up.

19:36.380 --> 19:40.250
- The, uh, admission
price is kind of faded.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.820
How much does it cost?

19:42.850 --> 19:46.860
- It's Halloween, there's
no fee on Halloween.

19:46.890 --> 19:48.360
- Seriously?

19:48.390 --> 19:51.460
Friggin' sweet.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.400
- So how does it normally
work, you get your money back

19:53.430 --> 19:54.960
if you make it all the way up?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.430
- No.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.940
- So?

20:00.970 --> 20:04.270
- You gotta make it
all the way down.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.540
- What?

20:06.580 --> 20:10.280
- Start at the top, make
your way to the bottom.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.320
- And nobody's ever made
it all the way through?

20:13.350 --> 20:17.520
- Nobody escapes purgatory.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.760
- Awesome.

20:22.830 --> 20:26.460
All right, well, let's do this.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.780
Bwahahaha.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.750
Shut up.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.580
- This is badass.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.880
- Mel, d'ya call Trish?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.090
- You really want
me to call her?

20:50.120 --> 20:53.920
- Yeah, get her ass out here.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.060
- Where is this place again?

20:55.090 --> 20:57.830
- County K, just off Main.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.100
This is where those chainsaw
dudes usually pop out.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.700
- Stop it, I hate those guys.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.800
- I do, too.

21:31.730 --> 21:32.960
- Holy shit.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.670
- That is amazing.

21:36.700 --> 21:37.730
- It's small.

21:37.770 --> 21:39.940
- Nate hears that a lot.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.440
- I thought you started
on the fifth floor.

21:42.470 --> 21:45.940
- It must be some basement.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.380
Come on.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.120
- Where is everybody?

21:59.150 --> 22:01.520
- Inside facing
their darkest fears.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.460
- I can't believe there's
no line on Halloween night,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.660
I mean there's always crazy
lines at these things.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.860
It's cause everybody's
dumb like you

22:07.900 --> 22:09.700
and doesn't think
this place exists.

22:09.730 --> 22:12.030
- You're dumb.
- You're dumb.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.870
- Hey, did you bring any beer.

22:16.910 --> 22:20.940
- Yeah, but none for you.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.650
- Yeah.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.500
- Secrets, secrets are so fun,

22:41.530 --> 22:45.970
Your secrets here
will come undone.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.540
Creepy.

22:47.570 --> 22:48.200
- Cheesy.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.640
- Awesome.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.040
- You're awfully quiet.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.450
- What?

22:56.480 --> 22:57.510
Oh yeah.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.980
- You're not scared are you?

22:59.010 --> 23:00.420
- A little bit.

23:02.220 --> 23:03.790
Bwah!

23:05.250 --> 23:07.590
Oh!

23:09.690 --> 23:13.630
- Nothing is hidden
inside this place.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.930
Abandon all hope for it
cannot penetrate these walls.

23:22.140 --> 23:24.540
- Well let's go.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.930
I can't see anything

23:44.960 --> 23:47.230
Which way do we go?

23:47.260 --> 23:50.000
Wait for
your eyes to adjust.

23:50.030 --> 23:52.100
Ryan, where are you?

23:52.130 --> 23:55.240
Right here,
just reach out.

23:55.270 --> 23:57.210
That's me.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.980
Here, you two go in front of
me, I'll bring up the rear.

24:00.010 --> 24:02.580
Hah, you would.

24:02.610 --> 24:04.710
Is that you?

24:04.750 --> 24:08.580
Here, put
your hand right here.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.120
Oh, you're gross.

24:10.150 --> 24:13.190
Ow, whatever,
you liked it.

24:13.220 --> 24:17.230
Wait, it's a door.

24:50.830 --> 24:53.130
- Don't leave me, Mel.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.770
- What is it?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.810
What is it?

25:16.220 --> 25:20.190
- It's, uh, it's...

25:26.660 --> 25:29.770
- A weird picture of a carnival?

25:29.800 --> 25:33.970
- No, I, wait a minute.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.370
That's not what it
was of, I swear.

25:36.400 --> 25:41.240
Whoa, um, vandalism
is probably frowned upon.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.580
- I, uh...

25:52.660 --> 25:56.020
- What did you think it was of?

25:56.060 --> 25:59.900
Um nothing, nothing.

26:04.700 --> 26:08.700
- Well, that will happen
in the House of Purgatory,

26:08.740 --> 26:11.110
bwahahahaha.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.180
All right, well.

26:14.210 --> 26:15.940
Yes.

26:15.980 --> 26:18.010
- Come on, sweetie.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.950
- That was the first floor?

28:02.990 --> 28:05.420
God this place sucks.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.020
No wonder they didn't
charge us any money.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.490
So easy.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.530
What?

28:11.560 --> 28:14.360
You really thought
it was that bad?

28:14.400 --> 28:17.370
What's your deal?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.370
- What?

28:19.400 --> 28:22.240
Did you see something behind us?

28:22.270 --> 28:26.510
- I did, did you
see the pool of piss

28:26.540 --> 28:29.110
where Ryan pissed his pants.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.280
- Come on.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.070
- Pussy.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.010
- Bet somethin's about
to jump out at us.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.910
One, two, three!

29:00.940 --> 29:03.850
Ahh
- Oh shit.

29:03.880 --> 29:08.180
Oh my God, that is the nastiest
thing I've ever smelled.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.890
Jesus, oh.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.290
- Oh, it stinks.

29:20.030 --> 29:22.460
- Looks real.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.270
- Don't touch it.

29:27.300 --> 29:31.810
Aw, it's slimy.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.020
Let's go, let's go.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.170
Think she's real?

30:32.200 --> 30:34.670
God, I hope not.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.370
- She sure is hot.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.610
You're sick, don't.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.340
- Oh come on, you
guys are no fun.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.150
Let's go.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.250
God, they should put
cameras up in here

30:47.280 --> 30:48.650
to see how dumb we look.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.390
- Help!

30:59.430 --> 31:02.500
Get me out of here!

31:02.530 --> 31:04.000
Get me out,

31:04.030 --> 31:06.070
get me out of here!

31:06.100 --> 31:09.570
Please, get me the
fuck out of here!

31:11.210 --> 31:15.440
- Whoa, that was intense.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.410
- That scared the
shit out of me.

31:17.450 --> 31:20.620
Me, too,
that was awesome.

31:20.650 --> 31:24.220
- No it wasn't, I don't think
I want to do this anymore.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.450
- What?

31:25.490 --> 31:29.290
It's not like they're actually
killing anybody or anything.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.430
- Did you see her eyes?

31:31.460 --> 31:32.460
- What?

31:32.490 --> 31:34.100
- Her eyes.

31:34.130 --> 31:36.300
- Shit, no, I was too busy
trying not to piss myself.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.400
- She looked scared.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.170
Like, real scared.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.570
- Yeah, she's a good actress.

31:45.610 --> 31:50.210
- I don't know, that
was almost too real.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.110
- Yeah, that was over the top.

31:52.150 --> 31:53.350
- Of course it was,

31:53.380 --> 31:55.450
how else are they gonna
get people to flake out?

31:55.480 --> 31:56.550
- I don't wanna go any further.

31:56.580 --> 32:00.520
- What? Come on!

32:00.560 --> 32:03.130
- Amber, we've come this far,

32:03.160 --> 32:05.260
I mean, what could be worse
than what was back there?

32:05.290 --> 32:08.130
- I don't know,
that's what scares me.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.370
- Let's just do one more,
and if we can't handle it,

32:11.400 --> 32:13.040
then we'll be done.

32:13.070 --> 32:16.300
You can't leave
me here, come on.

32:16.340 --> 32:19.140
You can't let these guys
think they're braver than us.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.180
We'll never live that down.

32:23.350 --> 32:25.110
- All right
- Nice.

32:25.150 --> 32:29.220
- Amber coming
through in the clutch.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.450
Hey, think how awesome it's
gonna be to be able to say

32:30.490 --> 32:34.460
we were the first ones to ever
make it all the way through.

32:34.490 --> 32:37.730
Look, I got you, OK?

32:37.760 --> 32:40.360
If you want out, we'll
all go, all right?

32:43.070 --> 32:46.770
Let's see what's next.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.610
- What the?

33:37.320 --> 33:39.320
- OK, how did?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.790
- We're outside.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.690
Like, actually outside,

33:44.730 --> 33:48.430
not in a room made
to look like outside.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.330
- We went down three
sets of stairs, though.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.840
- Guys.

33:59.710 --> 34:02.310
- What the?

34:02.340 --> 34:05.710
- How did they do that?

34:05.750 --> 34:09.179
How did they do that?

34:13.320 --> 34:16.620
- It's just me.
- Jesus.

34:18.190 --> 34:22.460
- You guys feel weird?

34:22.500 --> 34:24.170
- Yeah.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.739
- Yeah, I don't know, but yeah.

34:27.770 --> 34:30.810
- Like in horror movies

34:30.840 --> 34:32.570
when it's really quiet

34:32.610 --> 34:34.310
and you think something's
gonna jump out.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.610
- God damn it, you're
such a jerk sometimes.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.210
- Oh come on.
- It's not funny.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.650
Jeez, calm down.

34:43.650 --> 34:45.750
- What is that?

34:49.790 --> 34:52.130
What are you doing?

34:54.260 --> 34:57.770
- Well, we can't just
stand here all night.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.570
- Yeah, that's gotta
be the way to go,

34:59.600 --> 35:02.370
why else would there be a light?

35:13.780 --> 35:15.780
- Come on.

35:47.850 --> 35:49.880
- Something's up there.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.590
- It's just speakers up in the
trees, don't worry about it.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.870
- I heard something.

36:09.670 --> 36:12.410
There.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.480
Didn't you hear that?

36:14.510 --> 36:17.010
- I don't hear anything.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.650
- Yeah, me neither.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.980
- How do you not hear that?

36:22.020 --> 36:23.790
Amber.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.460
Amber.

37:20.410 --> 37:23.780
- Amber.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.450
Amber?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.920
- Amber.

37:29.950 --> 37:34.320
- How did she,
she was just here.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.530
- Amber, Amber!

37:37.560 --> 37:39.530
Where'd you go?

37:42.130 --> 37:44.570
- Amber?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.970
- Amber, can you hear me?

37:50.410 --> 37:52.670
Maybe she's just
fuckin' with us, guys.

37:52.710 --> 37:55.040
- Amber, no way
she would do that.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.350
Oh my God, Amber!

37:59.510 --> 38:01.080
- Amber!

38:01.120 --> 38:02.780
If you hear us walk
towards our voice!

38:02.820 --> 38:04.120
- Amber!

38:04.150 --> 38:06.550
- Shh, Mel, it's OK.
- It's not OK.

38:06.590 --> 38:07.960
- Look at me!
- It's not OK.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.660
- Look at me!
- This is your fault!

38:10.690 --> 38:11.630
It's a haunted house,

38:11.660 --> 38:13.560
they aren't gonna do
anything to any of us.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.530
The worst thing
they could have done

38:14.560 --> 38:16.500
is separated us somehow.

38:16.530 --> 38:18.530
- We have to find her.

38:20.740 --> 38:25.440
- I will, just calm,
just calm down.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.740
Don't worry about it.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.380
- I'm scared.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.110
- We'll just leave, OK?

38:33.150 --> 38:36.720
- We have to find her,
we have to find her.

38:36.750 --> 38:39.090
I don't know where she's
gone, but we have to find her.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.290
We have to find her, OK?

38:40.320 --> 38:43.160
- She's probably gonna be
watin' for us at the exit, OK?

38:43.190 --> 38:46.930
- Yeah.
- OK.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.000
OK, we have to move towards it.

38:49.030 --> 38:50.600
- Now remember, it's
just a haunted house,

38:50.630 --> 38:54.470
they're not gonna do
anything to any of us.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.900
Come on.

39:39.550 --> 39:41.680
- Well this is quaint.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.820
- Yeah.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.960
- Wet.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.700
- What do we do?

39:59.830 --> 40:02.840
- I don't wanna do this.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.740
What are you doing?

40:09.780 --> 40:12.110
- Just lookin', chill.

40:16.150 --> 40:17.550
What?

40:17.590 --> 40:19.890
Oh, shit.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.960
Screw this, let's get
the fuck out of here.

40:21.990 --> 40:25.160
- Ryan! God damn it!

40:25.190 --> 40:27.930
God damn it!

40:31.130 --> 40:33.600
- Nate!

40:33.640 --> 40:37.140
Nate, can you hear me?

40:37.170 --> 40:38.910
Nate!

40:38.940 --> 40:40.540
- Ryan!

40:40.580 --> 40:42.980
Get back, I'm gonna kick it in.

40:46.280 --> 40:50.150
Ryan, Ryan!

40:54.920 --> 40:58.990
- Ryan, Ryan!

40:59.030 --> 41:00.260
- Shh, it's all right.

41:00.290 --> 41:04.930
- No, Nate, he was just here,
what the Hell happened to him?

41:04.970 --> 41:06.970
Ryan!

41:07.000 --> 41:11.140
- It's only a haunted house,
it's only a haunted house.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.870
- I don't want to
do this anymore.

41:12.910 --> 41:15.040
I'm done, seriously, I want out.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.080
- I know, Mel, I--

41:16.110 --> 41:18.280
- No, I'm done.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.010
I want out now.

41:19.050 --> 41:20.920
- Well so do I.

41:20.950 --> 41:23.280
How the fuck do you
suggest we do that?

41:23.320 --> 41:25.290
Look around.

41:25.320 --> 41:29.120
- Well if we want out,
they have to let us out.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.790
We're done!

41:30.830 --> 41:33.130
We want out, please let us out.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.900
Hello, let us out!

41:38.930 --> 41:42.670
Let us out, God damn
it, let us the fuck out!

41:49.310 --> 41:53.680
Shh, it's all right.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.250
You all right?

41:58.290 --> 42:00.090
- No.

42:01.020 --> 42:02.960
- Dumb question.

42:07.830 --> 42:10.300
Looks like all we can do
is keep moving forward,

42:10.330 --> 42:13.770
find an exit, all right?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.070
- Move forward, huh?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.740
Which direction do
you suppose that is?

42:17.770 --> 42:21.080
- Well we were obviously
supposed to see this.

42:21.110 --> 42:22.680
I mean, they wanted us to
get split up with their

42:22.710 --> 42:25.680
Hou-little-dini shit here.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.320
I guess we just keep
going that way, all right?

42:40.260 --> 42:43.300
- Don't let go of me, promise.

42:43.330 --> 42:45.900
- I promise.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.710
- Nate!

43:00.680 --> 43:02.280
Shit.

43:14.060 --> 43:15.900
All right.

43:18.200 --> 43:19.870
This sucks.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.760
Hello, anyone there?

44:06.810 --> 44:08.820
Hello?

45:14.550 --> 45:16.420
Fuck.

45:26.430 --> 45:29.030
Hello?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.770
Hello?

46:00.490 --> 46:02.400
Hello?

46:44.140 --> 46:47.110
I'm an idiot.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.250
Worst idea ever.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.090
Fuck it.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.480
Fuck.

47:27.510 --> 47:29.120
No, no.

47:32.190 --> 47:35.160
No, no, no

47:35.190 --> 47:36.990
No.

47:41.130 --> 47:44.400
Why are you doing this?

47:58.180 --> 48:00.110
Why?

48:29.080 --> 48:30.480
- Help!

48:45.190 --> 48:47.290
Hello?

48:52.100 --> 48:55.700
Please, help me.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.510
Please.

49:07.750 --> 49:10.650
Help me, please.

49:15.720 --> 49:19.230
- Where the Hell are we?

49:19.260 --> 49:22.200
- I don't think this is
a normal haunted house.

49:22.230 --> 49:25.100
- What do we do?

49:25.130 --> 49:27.170
- Find a way out.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.270
Come on.

49:33.810 --> 49:36.010
- What is that?

49:49.420 --> 49:51.190
What?

49:51.230 --> 49:52.360
- It's...

49:55.300 --> 49:56.760
- What?

49:56.800 --> 50:00.270
- It's nothing, come on.

50:20.290 --> 50:22.220
- Nate?
- No.

50:24.230 --> 50:28.260
Oh God, oh God.

50:30.230 --> 50:32.300
- What is it Nate?

50:32.330 --> 50:34.700
- I didn't know, I swear.

50:34.740 --> 50:36.440
- What?

50:36.470 --> 50:38.570
- Oh my God.

50:38.610 --> 50:40.770
- What is it, talk to me.

50:43.310 --> 50:45.850
- Oh fuck.

50:45.880 --> 50:48.220
- What is going on.

50:51.720 --> 50:54.860
Nate, talk to me, what is this?

50:54.890 --> 50:58.260
- I hit something.

50:59.490 --> 51:02.360
I messed up.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.830
Bad.

51:05.370 --> 51:06.800
It was an accident.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.640
- What happened, Nate?

51:17.280 --> 51:20.250
- I hit something,

51:20.280 --> 51:23.350
last year with my car.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.790
Nobody knows, nobody.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.130
It was raining and

51:36.830 --> 51:39.630
he was changing his tire, I.

51:42.940 --> 51:47.270
Look, I'd only had one beer.

51:47.310 --> 51:51.210
I swear.

51:51.250 --> 51:53.350
I must have drifted
somehow, I don't.

52:01.460 --> 52:03.860
Look, I didn't know I hit him.

52:05.930 --> 52:08.660
I saw it on the news.

52:10.830 --> 52:13.430
- Jesus, Nate.

52:14.540 --> 52:16.370
- I know.

52:19.840 --> 52:22.580
Look, how does this place know?

52:22.610 --> 52:26.410
Look, that's impossible.

52:26.450 --> 52:29.880
Earlier inside, I saw
a guy, in a raincoat.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.750
And I thought it was

52:32.790 --> 52:34.590
- How is it possible?
- This guy.

52:38.290 --> 52:40.460
It's not.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.530
- You remember when
I got freaked out

52:47.570 --> 52:50.700
by that picture on the wall?

52:50.740 --> 52:54.580
- The carnival one?

52:54.610 --> 52:58.410
- No, well, yeah, it
wasn't a carnival.

52:59.350 --> 53:01.380
Not at first.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.880
- Well what was it?

53:03.920 --> 53:07.750
- It was a picture of me and
my uncle when I was eight.

53:09.890 --> 53:13.360
- That's weird, but not
really all that scary.

53:15.460 --> 53:18.230
- Well that's because
you didn't know.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.970
My uncle was, um,

53:27.870 --> 53:29.580
sick.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.710
And my father knew it.

53:38.790 --> 53:40.490
And he let him,

53:42.660 --> 53:44.890
do stuff to me.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.660
- Jesus, Mel.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.490
Hurry, come on.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.590
Come on, Mel!

54:20.630 --> 54:22.700
Go, come on!

54:29.670 --> 54:31.740
What is it?

54:31.770 --> 54:35.710
- I, I know this place.

54:36.980 --> 54:39.580
- Well, where are we?

54:41.850 --> 54:44.850
- We're in my uncle's house.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.600
- Hello?

54:58.630 --> 55:02.070
- My son, the homo.

55:03.870 --> 55:06.870
- Dad, I'm

55:08.110 --> 55:11.340
- Little fucking queer.

55:13.550 --> 55:14.980
- Dad.

55:17.680 --> 55:21.050
- No son of mine
is gonna be a fag.

55:22.620 --> 55:26.590
- Dad, don't, don't say that.

55:26.630 --> 55:28.730
I'm sorry.

56:01.060 --> 56:03.560
Dad, please.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.400
- You shut the Hell up.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.010
- Nate, please.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.580
- Don't talk to me, homo.

56:22.550 --> 56:25.420
- Dad, please.

56:28.220 --> 56:32.760
- I always knew there was
something queer about you.

56:36.530 --> 56:38.930
You ain't no son of mine, you're
just a whiny little faggot

56:38.970 --> 56:42.670
that needs to know that
shit don't fly around here.

56:49.840 --> 56:54.850
- Nate, Nate, please.

57:13.730 --> 57:17.140
No, no!

57:34.620 --> 57:35.960
- Where are you going?

57:35.990 --> 57:39.530
- This is where it all happened.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.930
- Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.640
- No, no, no, I can't be
down here, no I can't be--

57:49.670 --> 57:51.270
- No, there's nothing here.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.240
- You don't understand.

57:53.270 --> 57:55.240
I cannot go down here, Nate.

57:55.280 --> 57:57.110
- We have to.

57:57.140 --> 58:00.280
Come on, is there
another way out?

58:00.310 --> 58:01.880
Mel, come on, I need you.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.320
Is there another
way out down there?

58:03.350 --> 58:05.690
- There's stairs to the garage.

58:05.720 --> 58:08.960
- OK, good, come on.

58:08.990 --> 58:10.260
Mel.

58:11.730 --> 58:13.960
We'll be fine, OK?

58:13.990 --> 58:17.160
Come on, hey.

58:17.200 --> 58:21.000
I won't let anything
happen to you.

58:21.030 --> 58:24.840
I'm not gonna let
anything hurt you, OK?

58:26.010 --> 58:27.670
Come on.

58:27.710 --> 58:29.680
Come on.

58:42.660 --> 58:45.290
Come on.

58:50.130 --> 58:52.700
It's all right.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.020
Hey, princess.

59:41.150 --> 59:44.720
- It was our anniversary.

59:44.750 --> 59:47.850
He was on his way
home from work and,

59:50.320 --> 59:52.690
we were gonna go to the lake

59:52.730 --> 59:55.330
for a week like we
had done every year.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.900
He worked so, so hard.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:07.940
And he loved it so much.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.880
- I didn't know.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.180
- So hard, gave me everything,

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.790
and then you took him.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:25.430
- I didn't know, oh God.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.290
God, I'm so sorry.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.370
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.040
- And now we take you.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.710
No!

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:03.460
- Please, help me, please.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.510
Mom, Dad.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.250
Oh my God, please help me.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.250
- Don't you dare take the
good Lord's name in vain.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.020
- What?

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.990
Please, help me.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.990
Something's not right
here, this, this place

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.300
this awful place.

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:40.870
- Oh something is most
certainly not right here.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.070
You need to confess to what
it is you did, Amber Lynn.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.840
- I, I,

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.950
- How long have you
been whoring around?

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:52.980
- What?

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.080
Mom, no, look, Mom.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.790
- Don't you lie to me, Amber,

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.420
don't you make this any worse.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.030
You been doin'
things you shouldn't.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.960
Runnin' around,
being a little slut.

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.530
- No, Mom, no.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.230
- No?

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.270
I cannot believe you are
gonna sit there in that spot

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.940
and lie to my face.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:21.310
How in the Lord's name do
you think that happened?

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.920
- Mom, Daddy, no.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:33.150
No

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:40.290
This is impossible.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:44.030
Please, help me,
this can't be real.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.040
Mom, I,

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:55.080
I, Mom.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.150
We were,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.580
we were messing
around and it just,

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.220
it went too far, I
didn't think it could,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.630
and it did, and
then I got scared.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.600
- You think you killed
that life inside you.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:21.070
- Mom, I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.880
No!

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:43.420
No, no, no, no, please.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.030
No, no, no, please.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.040
No, no.

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.040
No, no.

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:08.410
No.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.550
No, no, no!

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.020
Hey, Princess.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.320
- No.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.360
- Oh, I've been missin' you.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.700
I've been missin' you,
you're all grown up,

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:00.370
but you smell the same.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.440
- No, no, get off me.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.980
- You still a wildcat, hmm?

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.080
You still a little wildcat, huh?

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:21.190
- Mom,

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.190
Mom?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.260
Mom?

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.300
Mom, where are you going?

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.170
Mom.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.350
No.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.470
- Mel, Mel.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:11.100
- Jesus, Mel, do you hear me?

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.610
- Here, help me get her up.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640
- It's OK, Mel.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.180
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.250
- Jesus, Mel, can you hear me?

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.380
It's OK, Mel.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:24.580
- It's OK.
- It's OK.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.490
Just a bump on
your head, we got you.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.290
- What happened?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.090
I saw crazy things,

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:35.260
crazy.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.560
- I know
- We saw them, too.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.300
- We're gonna get
the Hell out of here.

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.630
- How? We're--

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:44.300
- We made it out,
we called the cops.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.210
- I don't understand.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.550
- It's all right, let's go.
- Come on Mel,

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.050
it's OK.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:44.860
- Holy shit.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.500
- That is amazing.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.570
- Oh my God.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:55.580
No.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.880
No, this can't be.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:03.480
This isn't possible.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.890
Guys, look.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.520
Are you seeing this?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.290
Oh my God.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.870
No, no, no!

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.640
No, no!

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.670
Can't you hear me?

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:28.439
Don't go in there.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:32.250
Stop, Nate!

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.350
No!

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:44.420
- Nobody escapes Purgatory.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.790
- What do you want with us?

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.760
- We got what we wanted.

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:55.700
You.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.670
- Why are you doing this to us?

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:04.910
You found us.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.520
- You're not real.

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:13.620
The story, the house,
it's just an urban legend.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.960
- Legends start somewhere.

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.760
To keep a fire going,

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.960
sometimes, you need to add fuel.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.370
- I don't understand.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.680
Please don't.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.650
- Mel's text said that
this is where it is.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.530
This is
Melanie, leave a message.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.900
Must not have any
service, all their phones

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.800
are going straight to voicemail.

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:40.910
Where the Hell are they?
