WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:04.963
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.047 --> 00:08.133
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:14.765
On which we used to rely?

00:14.848 --> 00:18.227
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.647 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:25.025
Laugh and cry

00:25.108 --> 00:29.988
He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:33.992 --> 00:36.203
-TV ANNOUNCER:And now back to Romancing
-the Stone.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.163
The only way they're not
going to kill my sister

00:38.247 --> 00:39.748
is if we give
them the stone.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.500
Well, they're going
to be looking everywhere.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.043
We'll have to hide it
in my chin.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.336
MAN:
Andale, arriba...

00:44.419 --> 00:45.420
Uh-oh, here they come.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.339
You'd better get
in there, too.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.886
Good God, Joan Wilder's sister
is being held hostage

00:52.970 --> 00:56.098
in Cartagena, and there's
not a policeman in sight.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.975
I guess it's up to me.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.184
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.727
And I'm Diane Simmons.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.646
Our top story:
Mayor West has dispatched

01:02.729 --> 01:05.315
the entire Quahog police force
to Cartagena, Columbia,

01:05.399 --> 01:09.611
to assist in the rescue of fictional
1984 movie character, Elaine Wilder.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.904
More on that later.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.031
Now let's go to Ollie Williams'
Cooking Corner.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.408
What are you making, Ollie?
Eggo!

01:14.491 --> 01:15.909
Thanks, Ollie.
And now this.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.291
PETER: Lois, can you come
out here for a second?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.794
Hey, Lois, can you run inside
and get me some oranges

01:25.878 --> 01:27.004
or whatever it is
these things eat?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.964
Peter, what is that?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.466
Uh, this would be a giraffe,
Issac Newton.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.135
I stole it from the zoo.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.887
What with Mayor West sending
all the cops away,

01:34.970 --> 01:36.054
everybody can do whatever
they want.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.473
Peter, I don't care what
Mayor West has done.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.392
You can't just
break the law.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.227
Sure, I can.
I've been doing it all week.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.313
Like yesterday, I started
a lovable gang

01:44.396 --> 01:45.981
of cockney pickpockets.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.026
All right, boys,
the best targets are old, rich people.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.194
There's one now.
Go get him.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.781
Oh, no, there's no police
here to help me!

01:54.865 --> 01:58.410
I hope you don't find the money
strapped to my thigh.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.496
Peter, you take that thing back
where it belongs immediately.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.081
All right, I guess
we gotta go back

02:03.165 --> 02:05.042
to the zoo,
Allison Janney.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.376
Allison Janney?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.045
QUAGMIRE:
Oh, good morning, honey.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.546
That feels really good.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.924
What...? Hey! Hey! Hey!
What the hell?!

02:12.007 --> 02:13.634
You're not the same giraffe
from last night.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.885
Get out of here.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.473
What the hell?

02:19.890 --> 02:23.143
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

02:23.227 --> 02:25.145
I gotta stop taking my baths

02:25.229 --> 02:27.314
during Peter's shenanigans.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.027
(phone ringing)

02:32.110 --> 02:33.111
Hello.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.530
Oh, hey, Jillian.
What's up?

02:34.613 --> 02:38.158
Brian, are you coming over
to watch Laguna Beach tonight?

02:38.242 --> 02:39.868
Uh, what time does it start?

02:39.952 --> 02:42.204
10:00 Eastern
and Specific time.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.288
What?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.873
What did you say?
Specific time?

02:44.957 --> 02:46.083
Don't you mean Pacific Time?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.377
No, I think it's called
Specific time.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.712
They mean it starts
specifically at 10:00.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.549
(Stewie laughing)
Stewie, are you on the line?

02:53.632 --> 02:54.633
Yes.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.968
Jillian, I'll talk to you later.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.888
(sobbing uncontrollably)

02:59.972 --> 03:02.307
Uh, so...

03:02.391 --> 03:03.600
Meg...

03:04.476 --> 03:05.853
how was school?

03:05.936 --> 03:07.396
Horrible.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.566
There's a dance Friday night
and no one wants to go with me.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.026
Even my backup
guy had plans.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.486
Hi, Jimmy.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.405
Um, I heard you didn't
have a date to the dance,

03:16.488 --> 03:18.907
and I was wondering if
you'd like to go with me.

03:18.991 --> 03:22.035
Oh, uh, I, uh...
H-Hang on.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.330
(two gunshots)

03:25.414 --> 03:28.125
I'd love to go, Meg,
but I have to go

03:28.208 --> 03:30.836
to my little brother's
funeral that night.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.255
Aw, I'm sure you'll find
someone to go with you.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.631
No, I won't.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.675
I'm so fat and gross.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.093
Aw...

03:38.177 --> 03:40.179
I should just kill myself.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.890
Aw, that's...
Come on.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.725
I'm gonna do it.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.853
I'm gonna kill myself 'cause
no one will go with me.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.855
Aw...

03:51.440 --> 03:55.777
Meg, stop it.
Come on.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.571
All right, all right,
Meg, look,

03:57.654 --> 04:02.576
what if I... what if I drove you
and walked in with you or whatever?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.161
-(gasps): Brian, will you
-go with me?!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.787
Are you going to kill
yourself if I don't?

04:05.871 --> 04:06.955
Yeah.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.082
Well, then my hands
are pretty much tied.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.959
Oh, Brian, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.711
Oh, I have to buy
a new dress.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.546
All the ones I have
make me look fat.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.131
Aw...

04:16.215 --> 04:19.551
The story on everyone's mind
continues to be the absence

04:19.635 --> 04:22.262
of police officers in Quahog.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.224
Sir, as a citizen,
how has this affected you?

04:25.307 --> 04:26.892
The police are gone?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.769
Oh, my God,
we're finally safe!

04:28.852 --> 04:30.395
Freedom you see

04:30.479 --> 04:32.940
Has got our hearts
singing so joyfully

04:33.023 --> 04:34.483
Just look about

04:34.566 --> 04:36.693
You owe it to yourself
to check it out

04:36.777 --> 04:40.822
Can't you feel
a brand-new day?

04:40.906 --> 04:44.785
Can't you
feel a brand-new day?

04:44.868 --> 04:48.830
Can't you feel
a brand-new day?

04:48.914 --> 04:52.417
Can't you
feel a brand-new day?

04:54.545 --> 04:55.587
Hey, Joe, where you been?

04:55.671 --> 04:57.089
We haven't seen
you in days.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.091
Ever since Mayor West
deployed the police

04:59.174 --> 05:01.927
to Cartagena, I've
been working nonstop.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.887
The only reason I didn't
have to go myself

05:03.971 --> 05:07.015
is that South America isn't
wheelchair accessible.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.725
Hey, you guys, we
should help Joe out.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.102
We could be cops, right, Joe?

05:10.185 --> 05:13.105
Well, we have started
an emergency training program

05:13.188 --> 05:14.982
at the Police Academy,

05:15.065 --> 05:17.818
but I'm not sure that you're
cut out for the job.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.945
Come on, we'll be great cops.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.573
Besides, it's bound to go better
than my deep-sea training.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.200
Well, we've got long time
in this decompression chamber.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.119
You guys mind if I
turn on the radio?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.204
(hissing)
Peter, don't!

05:29.288 --> 05:31.331
Oh, nice going, jackass.
Look what you did.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.375
Hey, hey, excuse
the hell out of me

05:33.458 --> 05:35.669
for trying to brighten
your day with music, all right?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.462
You idiot,
use your brain.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.672
You're an idiot.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.257
(all shouting)

05:40.340 --> 05:41.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.970
stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.139
Oh, man, we're going to need
some butter or something.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.978
Oh, Brian, it is
so nice of you

05:53.061 --> 05:54.396
to take Meg to this dance.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.981
It really means
a lot to her.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
You got any weed?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.233
I put it in
your coat pocket.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.776
Here she is.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.613
Brian, I present to you your polished turd
for the evening.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.156
How do I look, Brian?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.618
Aw... you sure do, Meg.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.995
FYI, the carpet
matches the drapes

06:10.078 --> 06:12.080
in color and length.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.376
Well, Brian,
here we go.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.670
Oh, this is going
to be so much fun.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.137
God, this is going
to be a long night.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.764
Oh, Brian, let's dance.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.599
This song kicks ass.

06:30.682 --> 06:34.144
Hold on to the night

06:37.064 --> 06:40.108
Hold on to the memories

06:40.192 --> 06:43.737
Man, I got to tell ya, I can see
why you'd be insecure, Meg.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.157
Some of these chicks
are unbelievable.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.951
Brian, can I
ask you something?

06:49.034 --> 06:51.537
Are you drinking so much
because you don't want to be here?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.996
No, no, Meg.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.248
It's... that's...

06:54.331 --> 06:56.333
My God, look
at these chicks.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.752
You know, the best thing
about these girls is,

06:58.836 --> 07:01.880
even if you're terrible,
they don't know the difference.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.258
You know, Meg, there's
no dogs allowed here,

07:04.341 --> 07:05.884
so you're going
to have to leave.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.261
But Brian can stay.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.470
(chuckles)

07:08.554 --> 07:10.097
You know, Connie, I think
I have a theory

07:10.180 --> 07:11.181
about why you're
such a bitch.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.975
-Excuse me?
-Brian, let's just go.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.142
No, no, no,
no, no.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.769
Now hang on...
hang on, Meg, hang on.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.147
You see, Connie, you're popular
because you developed early

07:19.231 --> 07:21.108
and started putting out
when you were 12.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.277
But now you can't stand
to look at yourself in the mirror

07:23.360 --> 07:24.903
because all you see
is a whore.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.322
So, you pick on Meg to avoid
the inevitable realization

07:27.406 --> 07:29.825
that once your body's
used up by age 19,

07:29.908 --> 07:30.993
you're going to be

07:31.076 --> 07:32.786
a worn-out,
chalky-skinned burlap sack

07:32.870 --> 07:34.121
that even your
step-dad won't want.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.706
How's that? Am I
in the ballpark?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.332
(crying)

07:38.333 --> 07:40.085
Brian, that
was amazing.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.795
No one's ever stood up
for me like that.

07:41.879 --> 07:42.921
Hey, no problem.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.673
She's a... she's a skank.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.300
You know, you don't...
you don't deserve...

07:46.383 --> 07:49.511
you don't deserve all the crap you get,
Meg, you know that?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.013
Thanks, Brian.

07:52.389 --> 07:58.353
Tell me why...

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
(retching)

08:02.065 --> 08:04.193
Sorry, that was
the booze, not you.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.570
You gonna eat that?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.744
Oh, yes, the day can begin.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.245
Good morning, Brian.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.039
Now we can do this
one of two ways.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.999
I can bust your balls
to pieces right now,

08:19.082 --> 08:20.876
or we can spread it out
over the course of the day.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.461
I don't want to
talk about it.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.630
Well, I do, so tell me everything
that happened at the dance.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.839
Morning, cutie.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.007
Uh, hey.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.426
I had so much fun last night,
Brian.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.845
Hey, I thought maybe we could
go get some coffee later.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.222
I-I don't think so.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.807
Oh, come on,
who's a good boy?

08:35.891 --> 08:38.185
Who's a good boy, huh?
Who's a good boy?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.269
Me.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.146
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
who's a good boy?

08:41.230 --> 08:42.856
I am.
I'm a good boy.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.358
But... no, no, no,
look, look...

08:44.441 --> 08:46.235
-I got stuff to do today,
-All right? Sorry.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.903
Well, we should
hook up anyway.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.154
I'll bug you later.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.701
Well, she seems to have
taken a shine to you, Brian.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.036
With a little encouragement,

08:56.119 --> 08:58.288
you might get her to put
her cankles behind her ears.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.373
Stewie, shut up.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.457
(phone buzzing)

09:00.541 --> 09:03.377
Who the hell is texting
me at 8:00 a.m.?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.338
Wait a minute.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.507
Something did happen
last night.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.634
Look, it's, it's not that
big a deal, all right?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.345
We just... we just...
made out a little.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.431
Ahhh! Tell me about it! Go.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.058
It didn't mean anything.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.726
I had a few too many and...

09:19.810 --> 09:21.186
it's, it's not even
worth going into.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.063
Oh, this is even
a bigger jackpot

09:23.146 --> 09:24.940
than when the Emperor
figured out the formula

09:25.023 --> 09:26.942
for great Star Wars dialogue.

09:27.025 --> 09:32.865
(sonorously): Something, something,
something, dark side...

09:32.948 --> 09:36.910
Something, something, something,
complete.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.053
Well, this is it.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.472
Our first day
of Police Academy IV.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.391
Welcome to the
Police Academy.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.895
We're going to start by learning
how to do a cavity search.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.855
Peter, you will be
the police officer

10:04.938 --> 10:06.732
and Quagmire, you
will be the suspect.

10:06.815 --> 10:07.941
Begin.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.944
Sir, I suspect you are in
possession of drugs,

10:11.028 --> 10:12.654
and I'm going to have to give
you a full cavity search.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.531
Drop your pants.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.869
-JOE: Uh, Peter, you don't have
-to pull your pants down.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.579
Oh, sorry.
I'm still learning.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.289
All right,
start the search.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.134
I think
that's everything.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.928
PERFORMANCE ARTIST:
You want me to double-check?

10:39.932 --> 10:41.391
Hi, honey.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.643
What?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.686
I was thinking about
our kiss last night.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.356
I never knew how flat
and wide your tongue was.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.024
Yeah...

10:49.107 --> 10:51.443
You know, I thought about how you stood up
for me at the dance,

10:51.527 --> 10:53.070
and all the nice things
you said.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.156
We should totally
be boyfriend and girlfriend.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.409
-Well, Meg, uh, you know what's
-strange?

10:59.493 --> 11:02.037
I-I-I think
I might be gay.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.706
Um, I-I saw this penis
on the Internet today

11:04.790 --> 11:06.333
and I thought to myself,

11:06.416 --> 11:09.002
"Well, that's...
that's just fine."

11:09.086 --> 11:10.629
I'm going
to the mall later.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.966
Maybe you can come and help me pick out
some underwear.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.134
Uh, I don't think that's gonna be
a possibility.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.720
I have plans, um...

11:18.804 --> 11:19.888
with Chris.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.265
Chris and I have plans
this afternoon.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.516
We do?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.101
Yeah, yeah, we're doing,
we're doing that thing.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.520
We're doing what
you usually do

11:26.603 --> 11:27.604
on a Thursday afternoon.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.814
Masturbate?

11:28.897 --> 11:30.315
That's it. That's what
we're doing together.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.861
Well, maybe back to back,
but I gotta tell you

11:33.944 --> 11:35.529
I'm not 100% on this.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.156
Oh, there's the
cute prom couple.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.491
Hi, Mom. Is it cool

11:39.575 --> 11:41.827
if Brian and I go
to the mall this afternoon?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.328
Actually, I thought
I was pretty clear...

11:43.412 --> 11:45.205
Oh, of course
it's okay.

11:45.289 --> 11:48.417
Ever since that dance, you two have become
such good friends.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.626
Who would
have thought?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.295
Oh, we're more
than friends, Mom.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.130
Last night
at the dance, Brian...

11:53.213 --> 11:54.840
Last night, we decided
to be best friends.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.967
Right, Meg? Come on.
Let's go to the mall.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.012
We'll get ya, get ya
a big ol' pretzel.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.221
I want a pretzel, too!

12:02.389 --> 12:05.851
-CHRIS: Brian, I'm ready?
-You in or out?

12:13.692 --> 12:16.153
Everyone,
this is Brian.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.071
Oh, this is Brian.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.531
He does look
like Ben Affleck.

12:19.615 --> 12:20.949
He looks just like
Ben Affleck.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.784
-Is that Ben Affleck?
-Hey.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.328
So, how did you guys meet?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.705
I'm, uh, a friend
of her dad's.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.415
Ooh, he's older.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.499
He's cute.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.792
Do you have
a brother?

12:30.876 --> 12:33.212
Makeup and stickers
and ponies and mySpace.com.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.048
Brian's the first serious
boyfriend I've ever had.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.592
Uh, Meg, can I talk
to you for a second?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
Look, this has gone
a little too far.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.597
I like you.
I think you're great,

12:43.680 --> 12:46.099
but what happened
at the dance was...

12:46.183 --> 12:48.018
I mean, that kiss
was just a mistake.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.520
Oh, no.
Did I do something wrong?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.230
-Was it because I didn't sniff
-your butt first?

12:51.313 --> 12:52.898
What? No!

12:52.981 --> 12:55.067
I mean, yes, that's, that's how I would
know you're interested,

12:55.150 --> 12:57.444
but Meg, the fact is that
you and I are friends,

12:57.528 --> 12:59.613
and that's the way
it needs to stay.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.240
Besides, I have
a girlfriend.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.574
I'm dating Jillian.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.744
All right, Brian.
I understand.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.496
Good. I'm gonna
grab Stewie,

13:07.579 --> 13:08.580
and then we can go.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.626
What's that, Brian?
Oh, you were just kidding.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.796
I know you were.
I love you, too, Brian.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.967
And you love me.
You do love me, Brian.

13:25.931 --> 13:26.932
Hey, Brian.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.100
Oh, Meg, hey.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.893
Hey, listen, I hope
you're feeling all right

13:29.977 --> 13:31.228
about out little talk
the other day.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.689
You know, about us being
just friends and all.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.024
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:36.108 --> 13:40.279
-And hey, look, I wanted to thank you
-for being so great to me.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.364
So, I baked you a pie.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.448
Oh, wow.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.741
Hey, that looks delicious.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.952
Mmm, oh, this is good.
What's in there?

13:47.035 --> 13:50.205
Well, there's some
apples and some cinnamon

13:50.289 --> 13:52.374
and my hair.
What?

13:52.457 --> 13:54.334
My hair's in
the pie, Brian.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.336
And now it's
inside of you.

13:56.795 --> 14:00.465
Part of me is inside
of you, Brian.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.009
Do you feel me, Brian?

14:02.593 --> 14:05.262
Do you feel me inside of you?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.766
Ooh, you got
some pie, huh?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.935
-Can I have a piece?
-Uh, sure.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.854
Ooh, let me have
some of that Cool "Hwhip"?

14:13.937 --> 14:14.980
What'd you say?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.565
You can't have a pie
without Cool Hwhip.

14:16.648 --> 14:17.649
Cool Hwhip?

14:17.774 --> 14:18.775
Cool Hwhip, yeah.

14:18.859 --> 14:19.860
You mean Cool Whip.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.361
-Yeah, Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

14:21.445 --> 14:22.779
-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.323
-Cool Hwhip.
-You're saying it weird.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.866
Why are you putting so much emphasis
on the "H"?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.034
What are you
talking about?

14:27.117 --> 14:28.118
I'm just saying it--
Cool Hwhip.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.203
You put Cool Hwhip
on pie.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.537
Pie tastes better
with Cool Hwhip.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.622
-Say "whip."
-Whip.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.831
Now say Cool Whip.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.249
-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.751
-Cool Hwhip.
-Cool Whip.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.503
-Cool Hwhip.
-You're eating hair!

14:39.338 --> 14:43.133
-Well, Lois, I am now a graduate of the
-Quahog Police Academy.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.135
and an official
on-duty cop.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.387
-(purrs) I can't believe
-I'm married

14:47.471 --> 14:49.848
to a big, scary
police officer.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.850
Just keep your eyes
on the eggs, ma'am.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.603
(shrieks)
Yes, officer!

14:54.686 --> 14:55.896
(shrieks, laughs)

14:55.979 --> 14:57.606
You are such
a dirty cop.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.941
Don't break
those yolks, ma'am.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.025
Ow!

15:00.108 --> 15:01.860
Oh, my God, Lois,
I hit you!

15:01.944 --> 15:04.988
-I know. Now stick your finger in there
-and twist it!

15:08.367 --> 15:10.869
-Hey, uh, Lois, can I talk to you
-for a second?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.871
I think we may have
a problem with Meg.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.122
You're telling me.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.999
She's been locked
in her room all day.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.043
Who knows what
she's doing up there.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.712
(melancholy aria playing)

15:28.303 --> 15:30.055
Yeah, well,
the thing is,

15:30.138 --> 15:32.975
-Meg is becoming a little enamored
-with me,

15:33.058 --> 15:36.061
and I'm kind of
losing control of the situation.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.605
Oh, she's just grateful
you took her to the dance.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.024
Well, uh, I think
it's more than that.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.444
Uh, so, here's the thing,
and don't get mad.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.280
And that part I can't
stress enough.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.865
That's a great shirt,
by the way.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.952
Um, I may have
made out with Meg.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.121
(grunts)

15:54.204 --> 15:55.455
Okay, I had that coming.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.958
-What the hell is wrong with you,
-you sick bastard?!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.126
Look, I was drinking...

15:59.209 --> 16:00.711
Oh, what a shock!

16:00.794 --> 16:02.045
Oh-oh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.797
Look, the short version
is, this morning,

16:03.881 --> 16:05.632
she made me eat
the hair in her pie.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.009
No, it's not what
you think.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.635
Stewie had some, too.

16:08.719 --> 16:09.720
Stop punching me!

16:09.803 --> 16:11.597
Look, Brian,
I don't know

16:11.680 --> 16:13.265
what the hell happened
between you two,

16:13.348 --> 16:16.435
but you'd better go upstairs
and straighten it out right now.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.062
Ugh! This is even worse
than when you ate that bubblegum

16:19.146 --> 16:20.397
out of the garbage.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.442
-Brian, did you get into the garbage
-last night?

16:23.525 --> 16:25.319
Uh, no. Why?

16:25.402 --> 16:26.945
Don't lie to me, Brian.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.030
I'm not lying.
(farts)

16:32.159 --> 16:34.453
Uh, Meg, you got a minute?

16:38.749 --> 16:40.584
What the hell?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.127
I made that
for you, Brian.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.046
Meg!
Look, you obviously

16:44.129 --> 16:46.548
didn't hear me yesterday,
so I'll explain it again.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.091
And here to assist me
is headmaster

16:48.175 --> 16:50.260
of the New York School
For The Hard of Hearing,

16:50.344 --> 16:51.386
Mr. Garret Morris.

16:51.470 --> 16:54.056
Meg, we're not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.518
-(yelling): We're not boyfriend
-and girlfriend!

16:57.601 --> 16:59.353
I will never be
attracted to you.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.315
I will never be
attracted to you!

17:03.398 --> 17:05.901
You're acting like
a psycho bitch.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.987
You're acting
like a psycho bitch!

17:09.071 --> 17:11.198
Good night and have
a pleasant tomorrow.

17:11.281 --> 17:16.119
Good night and have a
pleasant tomorrow!

17:17.829 --> 17:20.832
I won't be ignored, Brian.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.918
Mm, I like your ass.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.135
(grunts)

17:36.515 --> 17:37.558
Joe, I gotta tell you,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.017
this whole cop thing
ain't as exciting

17:39.101 --> 17:40.227
as I thought
it was gonna be.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.145
When do we get to shoot
some bad guys?

17:42.229 --> 17:44.106
Guys, it's not all about action.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.275
It's about staying vigilant
until you're needed.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.359
What are you doing?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.069
I'm watching Bonnie
undress.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.821
Bonnie's your wife.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.531
I know. I like to watch
her strip

17:52.614 --> 17:54.533
and pretend she's a woman
who I've never met,

17:54.658 --> 17:57.578
but who looks just like Bonnie
and lives in my house.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.830
Get naked, you strange whore!

17:59.913 --> 18:03.125
Peter, I haven't
seen Meg or Brian since last night.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.918
I think something
may have happened.

18:05.002 --> 18:08.255
Mom, is it bad if I saw
Meg tie up Brian

18:08.338 --> 18:10.424
last night, put him in
the trunk of his car

18:10.507 --> 18:11.633
and then drive away?

18:11.717 --> 18:14.386
What?! Chris,
why didn't you say anything?!

18:14.469 --> 18:16.555
I dropped the ball.
I'm sorry.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.141
I-I have just been
buried in paperwork

18:19.224 --> 18:20.809
for the past 72 hours.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.728
Oh, my God, Brian was right.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.563
Meg really must be obsessed
with him.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.190
Oh, Peter, we got
to find them.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.066
Don't worry, Lois,
we're the police,

18:28.150 --> 18:30.944
and we'll do our very best
to find Brian and girl Chris.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.823
I'm really having

18:34.907 --> 18:36.575
a great time
tonight, Brian.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.161
-I can't believe you went to all
-this trouble.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.829
Well, you know me.

18:40.913 --> 18:41.997
Oh, I do, Brian.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.166
I know you so well.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.084
So, are you ready?

18:46.168 --> 18:47.169
For what?

18:47.252 --> 18:49.254
For the fun we're
gonna have, Brian.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.548
We're gonna have
fun tonight.

18:51.632 --> 18:57.054
Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.057
Listen, Meg, I'm not
gonna lie to you here.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.475
I'm, I'm a little
uncomfortable.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.977
Oh, just relax.
We're gonna be here

19:04.061 --> 19:05.312
for a "hwhile."

19:05.395 --> 19:06.522
Well, I don't know if...
Wait. What?

19:06.605 --> 19:08.232
We're gonna be her
for a hwhile.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.526
-A hwhile?
-Yeah, a hwhile.

19:10.609 --> 19:11.610
You mean, a while.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.819
-A hwhile.
-A while.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.071
-A hwhile.
-A while.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.155
-A hwhile.
-A while.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.573
Brian, you're
acting "wheird."

19:16.657 --> 19:19.660
Oh, come on. That one doesn't
even have an "H" in it.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.119
Don't move, dirtbag!

19:21.203 --> 19:23.121
Holy crap,
what the hell is this?

19:23.247 --> 19:24.998
Brian, she's a teenager!

19:25.082 --> 19:26.792
Yeah, Brian, you're doing
the same thing

19:26.875 --> 19:28.627
that Mia Farrow
did to that Oriental guy

19:28.710 --> 19:30.254
that Woody Allen
brought home from the circus.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.547
Peter, hold on
to that thought,

19:31.630 --> 19:33.924
because I'm gonna
explain to you when we get home

19:34.007 --> 19:35.759
-all the things that are wrong
-with that statement.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.178
But first, Meg,
you need to let Brian go.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.264
But, Mom, I love him!

19:40.347 --> 19:41.974
Honey, you're just confused.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.767
I'm not confused!

19:43.851 --> 19:46.353
I've never been more certain
about anything in my life!

19:46.436 --> 19:47.938
I need him!

19:48.021 --> 19:50.983
Meg, I know that's what you think
right now, but you're...

19:51.066 --> 19:53.235
Oh, God, I wish
I could make you understand.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.195
You don't know
what you need.

19:55.279 --> 19:56.864
I know
what she needs.

19:56.947 --> 19:57.990
You do?

19:58.073 --> 19:59.408
You bet. Bring her
by my house

19:59.491 --> 20:01.326
around 8:30 tonight.
I'll take care of her.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.411
(doorbell rings)

20:04.288 --> 20:06.999
Hi, Mr. Quagmire. Mom said I should
come over here.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.125
Have a seat, Meg.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.169
Soon it'll all become clear.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.880
(soft piano music plays)

20:15.174 --> 20:17.593
Excuse me, while I get
a little more comfortable.

20:19.303 --> 20:22.097
Meg, I've watched you grow up
from a playful little girl

20:22.181 --> 20:23.932
into a very special
young woman.

20:24.016 --> 20:27.060
Now you probably just think
of me as square old Mr. Quagmire

20:27.144 --> 20:30.063
from next door, but I've been around
the block a few times,

20:30.147 --> 20:32.065
learned a couple things,
and I can tell you this,

20:32.149 --> 20:34.151
there's no reason
to grow up too fast.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.154
Teenage girls are exposed
to so much these days.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.615
I can see why a relationship
looks glamorous,

20:39.698 --> 20:41.408
but you've got all
the time in the world

20:41.491 --> 20:43.869
and a lot of wonderful
experiences ahead of ya.

20:43.952 --> 20:47.080
Hang on.
I want to give you something.

20:47.164 --> 20:49.625
This book helped me
when I was about your age.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.087
It let me know that as long
as I kept on rolling,

20:54.171 --> 20:57.007
I'd find that one person
who would make me whole.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.675
Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.177
You don't have
to thank me.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.888
Now get on out of here,
you little scamp.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.101
All right, ladies,
you ready for action?

21:08.185 --> 21:09.686
We sure are, Glen.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.230
Do you have
the "hwhip"?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.689
Got it right here...
wait. What?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.360
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.528
Coming up at 11:00,

21:17.611 --> 21:19.071
Quahog police return
to active duty

21:19.154 --> 21:20.572
after giving up the search

21:20.656 --> 21:23.325
for fictitious Romancing The
Stone character Elaine Wilder.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.910
Plus, in national news,

21:24.993 --> 21:26.578
America's scoutmasters
are asking,

21:26.662 --> 21:28.664
"Why are the kids so shy
in the shower?"

21:28.747 --> 21:29.748
And in entertainment,

21:29.831 --> 21:31.834
is Annette Benning made
of leather?

21:31.917 --> 21:34.002
A local tanner
has a surprising revelation.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.754
We'll have all this
and what else, Ollie?

21:35.838 --> 21:36.839
-Sports!
-And sports.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.215
Join us at 11:00.
