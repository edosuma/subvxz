and I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:11.619 --> 19:13.751
With Kayhill out of
the way at Interior,

19:13.753 --> 19:17.689
the acquisition of the Midwest
can begin in earnest.

19:17.691 --> 19:19.224
By who?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.427
Who's trying to take
over the Midwest?

19:21.429 --> 19:25.230
I care about you too much
to tell you that.

19:25.232 --> 19:28.634
You said if I pinned the murder
on Kayhill, we'd get married.

19:28.636 --> 19:33.171
Oh, I care about you
way too much to do that.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.572
And there's
a much bigger game

19:34.574 --> 19:36.374
that has to be seen
to its conclusion

19:36.376 --> 19:39.110
before we can truly
be together.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.979
I need more than that.

19:40.981 --> 19:42.914
You have no idea how hard
this is for me.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.284
I'm enormously popular
at work.

19:47.387 --> 19:51.122
What I will promise you is that
when this is all over,

19:51.124 --> 19:54.860
you're going to be First Lady
of a brand-new country.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.765
