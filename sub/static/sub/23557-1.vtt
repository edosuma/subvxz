Leave the cell door open.
Let him escape.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.030
lt's all very irregular. lt might entail
the most embarrassing repercussions.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.630
Exactement. lt's a responsibility
of the first magnitude.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.275
- Mr Wilson, you must see...
- Blast all this discussion.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.518
What good are words? l'm sick of words.
Hang the repercussions.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.952
lf l fail l am responsible.
Leave the cell door open. Let him escape.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.710
lt's our only chance. Let them
threaten me with hell and still l insist.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.868
This obscenity must be destroyed.
Do you hear me? Destroyed:

02:17.760 --> 02:19.990
Todos los pasajeros desembarquen.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.032
All passengers ready to disembark.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.311
l am travelling for my health.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.557

02:33.000 --> 02:35.434

02:42.120 --> 02:46.716

02:50.400 --> 02:52.356
l'm joining my husband.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.196
Next, please.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.510
Stefan Polaski.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.712
- You take care of him.
- Your business in this country?

03:05.840 --> 03:08.877
- l'm travelling for my health.
- How?

03:10.560 --> 03:15.680
- l am travelling for my health.
- You are a native of what country?

03:15.800 --> 03:20.191
- Poland.
- Oh, Poland. Grata permanencia.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.276
Next, please.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.994
-Que pasü?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.519
Hello?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.392
Yes.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.594
You're sure you know where he's going?

04:15.720 --> 04:18.995
My wife is following him.
He's going to the photographer's.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.590
Probably to get a new passport
and new instructions.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.875
Hold it.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.357
l wish to know the whereabouts
of Franz Kindler.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.436
Franz Kindler.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.754
There is no Franz Kindler.
Franz Kindler is dead. And cremated.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.836
lt's incorrect:

04:44.480 --> 04:49.235
l have a message for Franz Kindler.
From the All Highest.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.351
lt is... forbidden.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.711
l command you
in the name of that authority.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.677
You know the name he is using?

05:28.840 --> 05:32.230
Connecticut.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.911
ln the United States. The town of Harper.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.517
Harper.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.551
Oh...

06:14.280 --> 06:16.236
Excuse me.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.634

06:34.760 --> 06:37.320
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.273
- Have a nice trip?
- Yes, thank you.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.313
Quite a store you have here, Mr...

06:44.440 --> 06:46.237
- Potter.
- That's me.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.920
We sell about everything here.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.996
{laughs}

07:14.200 --> 07:16.839
This suitcase. l could leave it here?

07:16.960 --> 07:20.509
The bag?
l don't assume no responsibility.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.077
Just put it up on the shelf.
lt'll be there when you want it.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.873
- Can l buy this magazine?
- That'll be a dime.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.755
- What's the best hotel in town?
- Best place is down at Mrs Peabody's.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.838
lt's just down the road here a piece.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.238
- This way, mister.
- Yes. Thank you.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.156
{horn}

09:44.840 --> 09:46.796
l may come in?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.876
Yes, of course.

09:55.080 --> 10:00.029
- Does Mr Charles Rankin live here?
- Yes, but he isn't here right now.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.516
- Are you expecting him?
- Yes, in a few minutes.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.517
How soon?

10:05.640 --> 10:08.791
Well... a few minutes.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.876
A few minutes.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.116
l may...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.555
l may wait here?

10:22.040 --> 10:24.395
Well, yes, if you like.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.751
- Would you like to sit down?
- Thank you.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.435
- Are you a friend of Mr Rankin's?
- Yes, a friend.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.712
- l'm Mary Longstreet. How do you do?
- How do you do?

10:48.600 --> 10:53.196
Mr Rankin ought to be here now.
Sometimes he stays after his last class,

10:53.320 --> 10:57.279
but he'll come straight here today.
This is our wedding day.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.598
- You are getting married?
- Yes. At six o'clock.

11:01.720 --> 11:08.558
l know it's unconventional my being here
today, but l want to get these curtains up.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.917
When he comes,
which way does he come?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.873
Why, from Webster Hall.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.594
lt's the big dome building right over there.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.676
Thank you.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.590
Who shall l say that...?

11:35.080 --> 11:37.036
Franz.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.637
lt's l, Franz.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.797
Meinike. We mustn't
be seen talking together.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.356
Go back to the church.
lnto the woods, you understand?

11:46.480 --> 11:49.677
Follow the path. l'll meet you there.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.271
- Hello, Professor Rankin.
- Hello, men. What are you up to?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.834
- Paper chase.
- l lay the trail.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.997
You ought to have Jerry's job.
Trim that waistline.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.951
- You should go with us.
- Where to?

12:05.080 --> 12:07.435
- The woods.
- Hiya, blondie.

12:08.520 --> 12:14.072
The woods? l'd like to. l'm afraid
l have a couple of things to attend to.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.714
- Join us later.
- All right.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.796
We'll catch up with you.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.076
This way, fellas.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.990
- Meinike.
- Yes, Meinike.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.678
- l thought...
- l had been hanged.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.916
The others, but not l.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.477
A dead man could not stand
face to face with you, Franz.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.871
You're not much changed.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.515
Put you back in your old uniform,
you'd look very much the same.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.474
- l am a different man than before.
- l too.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.510
l too am different, Konrad.

13:08.400 --> 13:13.599
l destroyed every item in Germany
and Poland that might reveal my identity.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.473
Guess what l'll be doing at six tonight?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.353
Standing before a minister of the gospel

13:19.480 --> 13:22.790
with the daughter of a justice
of the US Supreme Court.

13:22.920 --> 13:27.948
The girl's even good to look at.
The camouflage is perfect.

13:28.080 --> 13:32.358
Who would think to look for the notorious
Franz Kindler in the Harper School,

13:32.480 --> 13:35.836
surrounded by the sons of
America's first families?

13:35.960 --> 13:41.796
And l'll stay hidden...
till the day when we strike again.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.037
Franz: There will be another war?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.756
Of course.

13:50.520 --> 13:54.877
War is an abomination, saith the Lord.
lt is to tell you this that l am here.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.391
- He set me free that l might come here...
- Set you free? Who set you free?

13:59.520 --> 14:01.476
The All Highest.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.517
- You don't mean...?
- l mean God.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.637
- God:
- Franz.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.719
- l am a new man since l found him.
- You, Konrad. Religious:

14:17.840 --> 14:22.868
Franz, all doors were opened to me.
All doors.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.355
lt was one of God's miracles.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.396
Mm-hm.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.190
They freed you so you'd lead them to me.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.312
Have you been followed?
Were you followed here?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.556
- Yes.
- Who followed you?

14:46.680 --> 14:48.398
The evil one.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.229
He looked like any other man.
He was dressed like any other man.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.191
He even smoked a pipe.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.313
But l recognised him through his disguise,
and l killed him.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.795
Struck him from on high down.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.516
God's will be done.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.359
You killed him, the man with the pipe?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.516
The man who followed you?

15:11.760 --> 15:13.910
No one else followed you?

15:16.120 --> 15:18.076
Mm-hm.

15:21.440 --> 15:27.117
You must be brought to salvation, Franz.
Confess your sins as l have.

15:27.240 --> 15:31.995
Proclaim your guilt.
Only thus you can attain salvation.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.873
- You really think so, Konrad?
- lt will take strength.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.151
Such strength as can come
only from God.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.316
Kneel by me, Franz.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.479
And together we will pray to him
to give you strength.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.789
l have sinned against heaven
and before thee.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.193
l am not worthy to be called thy son.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.716
Say these words after me.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.910
l despair of my sins.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.956
l despair of my sins.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.510
- O God of all goodness.
- O God...

16:16.640 --> 16:21.395
- How could l ever have offended thee?
- ..of all goodness.

16:30.720 --> 16:34.076
This way, fellas:
Don't let him get away.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.276
Hey, fellas, there's the trail.
Hurry up.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.516
This way, fellas.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.748
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God

17:57.320 --> 18:00.949
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

18:22.480 --> 18:28.316
..and, forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto her so long as ye both shall live?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.668
l will.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.473
Mary, wilt thou have this man
for thy husband,

18:32.600 --> 18:37.958
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?

18:38.080 --> 18:43.712
Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honour
and keep him in sickness and in health,

18:43.840 --> 18:48.868
and, forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto him so long as ye both shall live?

18:49.000 --> 18:49.955
l will.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.840
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.559
- Wedding?
- Yep. Judge Longstreet's daughter.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.831
He's Supreme Court justice, you know.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.956
- Bottle of aspirin, please.
- Back there, third shelf down.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.914
You'll see the big ones on the left,
the economy size.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.589
Have to get it yourself, mister.
Right back there.

19:24.560 --> 19:30.192
All your needs are on our shelves.
Just look around, help yourselves.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.596
Right in there. That's it.

19:33.720 --> 19:38.077
- Livin' down at Mrs Peabody's?
- Just a few days only.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.795
Coffee too, please.
Or should l get it myself?

19:42.920 --> 19:47.391
- Cafeteria style around here, mister.
- That's right. Self-service.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.275
- The usual, Frank.
- That's three dollars even, Mr Todd.

19:54.040 --> 19:59.273
- No limit on the cream?
- All the people around here take it black.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.913
- The one on the right.
- Thank you.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.757
- Who is Miss Longstreet marrying?
- One of the teachers.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.156
- A stranger in town.
- l issued the licence.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.430
Yep. l'm town clerk.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.112
Uh...

20:24.240 --> 20:26.959
- Checkers?
- All right.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.871
Town clerk, huh?
That must be quite a responsibility.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.037
Town clerk runs the town, you might say.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.199
We usually make it for... 1 5, 20...

20:45.040 --> 20:48.919
We often play as high as
25 cents the game.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.634
Well, that's kinda stiff for me, but...

20:51.760 --> 20:56.151
- Make a million, lose a million.
- That's the way it goes.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.836
- My move?
- Hm?

21:02.840 --> 21:04.796
All right.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.559
You must know just about
everybody in town here.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.797
Not just about. Know everybody.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.151
- Here on business?
- Mm-hm.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.031
- School business?
- Mm-mm.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.589
- Sellin' something?
- Mm-mm.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.796
Buyin'?

21:34.480 --> 21:38.109
Oh, antique dealer.
They all come to Harper.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.992
Judge Longstreet's got the best collection.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.270
l don't suppose he'd sell.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.513
Happen to know if there are
any other out-of-town buyers here?

21:51.640 --> 21:56.191
Let me see... Come to think of it,
there was a fella come in this morning.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.515
Came on the same bus with you.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.829
Left his suitcase here.
Never did come back for it.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.394
He might have been one of them.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.591
No. He was more the missionary type.

22:11.720 --> 22:16.510
Wasn't in long. Looked in the phone book.
Tiny little fella, he was.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.916
Thinnish. Unfortunate-looking.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.314
- Hurt your head?
- No, nothing serious.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.113
Oh, that's too bad.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.750
lt's a game you got to
keep your mind on. Hah:

22:35.560 --> 22:37.391
25 cents, please.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.477
Hello, Father. Has anybody seen
my brand-new husband?

22:49.600 --> 22:53.036
- Don't tell me he's deserted you already.
- Looks as if, the brute.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.469
Red, have you seen Charles?

22:55.600 --> 22:58.353
Go find him for me. Hurry up.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.514
l've looked everywhere for him.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.997
- l'm getting worried.
- Are you, darling? What about?

23:33.120 --> 23:36.157
Charles... You've changed.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.428
Don't you think you'd better?

23:40.560 --> 23:43.677
After all, aren't we supposed to be
going on a honeymoon?

23:43.800 --> 23:45.756
Give me five minutes.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.275
- Hello there.
- Hello.

24:55.680 --> 24:59.878
- Was that you working on the clock?
- No. l was just cleaning around it.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.788
lt's a beautiful thing,
from what l can see out front.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.230
- My name's Wilson.
- Noah Longstreet.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.590
l'm glad to know you.

25:09.720 --> 25:13.599
l couldn't judge too well out front,
but l'd say it was 16th century.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.473
Probably by Haabrecht of Strassburg.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.239
- The clock.
- l wouldn't know.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.079
My brother-in-law's going to work on it.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.670
- ls he up there now?
- No, he's on his honeymoon.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.678
He plans to work on it when he gets back.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.873
- ls he an expert?
- Yes, but it's more of a hobby with him.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.118
Really? Well, it is with me too.

25:37.240 --> 25:40.949
- Honeymoon?
- Yes. He and my sister.

25:42.840 --> 25:47.072
He has to be back on Friday
because of the examinations.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.191
He's one of the teachers at the school.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.433
- His name is Rankin.
- Oh?

26:00.160 --> 26:04.119
lt's nice to show it to someone who
knows what Revere silver's all about.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.473
- Personally, my specialty is pewter.
- Oh, yes. Pewter.

26:09.600 --> 26:14.116
The Revere workmanship,
although sometimes heavy in design,

26:14.240 --> 26:18.552
almost invariably shows
the sign of a master craftsman.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.557
lt is beautiful.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.069
- Noah.
- Hello, Mary.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.077
- Adam.
- Hello, Mary, dear.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.350
Mr Wilson, my daughter Mary.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.710
My son-in-law, Charles Rankin.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.071
l hope you don't mind
my intruding on your homecoming.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.714
- Good evening, Mary.
- Jeff, how are you?

26:35.840 --> 26:38.434
- You're looking good.
- Welcome home, Miss Mary.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.516
Sara:

26:41.440 --> 26:44.398
lf you don't sit down it'll get cold.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.710
- How were the mountains?
- Marvellous.

26:49.840 --> 26:54.834
Mr Wilson, will you sit on my right?
Jeff, your usual place. Darling, right there.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.714
You ought to see Charles on skis.
He's wonderful.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.149
- l'm pretty good too, aren't l?
- Very.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.831
- Did you keep your knees together?
- Yes, freshy, l did.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.509
Mr Wilson here is compiling
a catalogue of Paul Revere silver.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.598
- How nice.
- He's also an authority on clocks.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.871
- That's Charles' hobby too.
- So your brother tells me.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.992
You're going to fix
the one in the church tower?

27:19.120 --> 27:23.159
- l may try.
- That's quite an undertaking.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.191
l hope he fails.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.438
l like Harper just the way it is,
even with a clock that doesn't run.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.518
Have you been in Harper long, Mr Wilson?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.995
Since... Friday, a week ago.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.158
You lost a day.
l patched you up on Friday.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.590
- How's the head?
- Much improved, thanks to you, Doctor.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.837
You were hurt on Thursday.
The day of the wedding.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.829
Yes, that's right. Wednesday l left Bangor.

27:53.360 --> 27:56.158
- You were hurt, Mr Wilson?
- Nothing serious.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.114
Serious enough to raise a bump
on his head the size of a billiard ball.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.196
The usual door.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.799
Good thing you're back.
That dog of yours has been inconsolable.

28:07.920 --> 28:12.630
All right, Red, here you are.
This is for missing me. Good boy.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.957
- How was your meeting, Adam?
- lrritating.

28:16.080 --> 28:19.311
- The Foreign Policy Association.
- l read that report.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.398
- Standish.
- l think he's full of prunes.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.512
That's the way we used to talk
in the 1 930s, Noah.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.428
- Standish?
- The London Times man in Berlin.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.518
Of course he was
quoting rumours, mostly.

28:32.640 --> 28:37.794
Men drilling by night. Underground
meeting places. Pagan rituals.

28:37.920 --> 28:41.071
- Do you believe him?
- Well, anything's possible.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.154
l'm sorry, sir, but l think it's ridiculous.

28:45.280 --> 28:51.913
Besides some fanatics, no German in his
right mind can still have a taste for war.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.400
Do you know Germany, Mr Rankin?

28:57.240 --> 28:59.196
l'm sorry, l...

28:59.880 --> 29:05.318
l have a way of making enemies when
l'm on that subject. l get pretty unpopular.

29:05.440 --> 29:10.514
Well, we shall consider it the objective
opinion of an objective historian.

29:10.640 --> 29:15.475
Historian? A psychiatrist
could explain it better.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.388
The German sees himself as
the innocent victim of envy and hatred -

29:19.520 --> 29:24.389
conspired against, set upon
by inferior peoples, inferior nations.

29:24.520 --> 29:28.229
He cannot admit to error,
much less to wrongdoing.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.351
We ignored Ethiopia and Spain,

29:30.480 --> 29:33.790
but we learned
the price of looking the other way.

29:33.920 --> 29:39.358
Men of truth have come to know for
whom the bell tolled, but not the German.

29:39.480 --> 29:43.712
He still follows his warrior guards,
marching to Wagnerian strains,

29:43.840 --> 29:47.435
his eyes still fixed upon
the fiery sword of Siegfried.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.917
ln those meeting places you don't
believe in, his dream world comes alive.

29:52.040 --> 29:57.239
He takes his place in armour beneath
the banners of the Teutonic knights.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.909
Mankind is waiting for the Messiah,
but for the German

30:01.040 --> 30:03.998
the Messiah is not the prince of peace.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.433
He's another Barbarossa.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.757
Another Hitler.

30:13.240 --> 30:18.678
Then you have no faith in the reforms
being effected in Germany?

30:19.800 --> 30:26.148
l don't know. l can't believe that people
can be reformed except from within.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.034
The principles of equality and freedom
never have taken root there.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.038
The will to freedom
is voiced in every other tongue.

30:33.160 --> 30:38.280
''All men are created equal.'' ''Liberte,
egalite, fraternite. '' But in German...

30:38.400 --> 30:43.155
There's Marx. ''Proletarians unite. You
have nothing to lose but your chains.''

30:43.280 --> 30:45.953
But Marx wasn't a German.
Marx was a Jew.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.756
My dear Charles, if we concede
your argument, there is no solution.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.236
- Sir, once again, l differ.
- What is it, then?

30:55.840 --> 31:00.231
Annihilation. To the last babe in arms.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.309
l can't imagine you're advocating
a Carthaginian peace.

31:06.360 --> 31:12.754
Well, the world hasn't had much trouble
from Carthage in the past 2,000 years.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.235
There speaks our pedagogue.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.916
- Speaking of teachers...
- Yes?

31:19.040 --> 31:24.558
The faculty is coming for tea on Tuesday.
Would you like to join us?

31:24.680 --> 31:27.717
l'd like to, but my work here is finished.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.159
l'm leaving Harper tomorrow.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.317
Extraordinary, clocks being
Mr Wilson's hobby too.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.396
Yes. lsn't it?

31:42.520 --> 31:45.637
- Red, how do you like your new house?
- He loves it.

31:45.760 --> 31:49.389
- Think l'll take you for a walk.
- Just let him out. He won't run off.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.114
l need the walk. l'm restless.
Come on, boy.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.837
That's good. Çow are you coming along?

31:59.960 --> 32:05.273
l'll be in Washington tomorrow afternoon.
You were right about Rankin.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.356
He's above suspicion.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.956
Here, Red.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.756
Red, come here.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.796
Give me long distance.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.956
l want Washington, DC.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.836
Who but a Nazi would deny that Karl Marx
was a German, because he was a Jew?

33:50.800 --> 33:53.837
l think l'll stick around for a while.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.353
What is it, dear?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.197
Oh.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.596
l'm sorry. l was dreaming.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.870
About that little man.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.480
What little man?

34:38.600 --> 34:41.751
You know, dear. l told you about him.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.838
He came here the day we were married.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.159
Light me a cigarette, will you?

34:52.719 --> 34:57.635
l've never had a dream like that before.
lt frightened me.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.836
Thanks.

35:04.120 --> 35:10.798
The little man was walking all by himself
across a deserted city square.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.237
Wherever he moved, he threw a shadow.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.279
But when he moved away, Charles,

35:19.400 --> 35:25.032
his shadow stayed there behind him
and spread out just like a carpet.

35:26.560 --> 35:30.599
- l wish you could think who he was.
- You're overtired.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.436
Perhaps.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.953
Here, dear. Put this out, will you?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.509
{whining and barking}

35:49.640 --> 35:51.710
What was that?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.796
{whimpering}

35:54.760 --> 35:57.479
That sounded like Red, Charles.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.991
- What in the world's the matter with him?
- l put him in the cellar.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.352
No wonder he's howling.
He's never been locked up in his life.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.948
lf Red is to live with us,
he must be trained.

36:09.080 --> 36:14.518
At night he will sleep in the cellar.
ln the daytime he'll be kept on a leash.

36:14.640 --> 36:19.236
l don't believe in dogs being
treated like prisoners. Red's my dog.

36:19.360 --> 36:23.035
Please, Mary. l know what's best.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.833
{Red whines and barks}

36:51.200 --> 36:54.237
Hi, Red. Thought you'd gone
to live with your mistress.

36:54.360 --> 36:58.194
Mary brought him home.
Said he howls all night.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.835
- Fishing any good in these parts?
- Pretty fair. Like to come?

37:01.960 --> 37:07.318
l've got the wrong clothes on, but
the fish probably won't mind. Thank you.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.959
l'm just not lucky today, that's all.

37:19.080 --> 37:23.039
- Would you like a candy bar?
- l don't mind if l do.

37:24.400 --> 37:29.190
- All your folks like fishing?
- My dad always brings in something.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.754
- What about Charles?
- Charles?

37:31.880 --> 37:33.393
Oh.

37:33.520 --> 37:39.117
l have to call him Mr Rankin at school.
l get a little mixed up sometimes.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.312
He spends most of his time on the clock.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.510
Why don't you like him, Noah?

37:45.200 --> 37:48.954
- What do you mean?
- You don't like your brother-in-law.

37:49.080 --> 37:53.119
lt's none of my business,
but l wish you'd tell me why.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.835
Well... l like him well enough.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.633
l don't know any reason why l shouldn't.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.436
Don't tell me l'm butting in - l know l am -
but l can't help myself.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.074
lt's my business.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.591
l hate bringing you into this,
but you're the only one l can turn to.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.110
- l need your help very badly.
- What is it?

38:16.720 --> 38:22.158
Your sister may be in trouble. You're man
enough for what l'm asking you to do.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.909
The truth is,
l'm not really an antique dealer.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.749
l'm sort of a detective.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.996
Well... what do you
want me to do, Mr Wilson?

38:38.120 --> 38:41.635
lt would help if l knew every move
Rankin made on his wedding day.

38:41.760 --> 38:45.036
- Right up to the ceremony.
- Well, l should be able to...

38:45.160 --> 38:50.314
- Unless Charles realises what l'm doing.
- l'll keep him busy.

38:56.080 --> 39:01.074
You must be wrong. Mary wouldn't
fall in love with that kind of a man.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.988
l hope l am wrong, but that's the way it is.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.749
People can't help
who they fall in love with.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.711
- Evening, Mr Potter.
- Evening, Mr Wilson.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.479
- Evening, boys.
- Evening, sir.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.116
85 cents.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.828
Hear you and Rankin aim to fix the clock.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.996
That's right.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.796
- Figure it to tell time rightly?
- Mm-hm.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.669
And will the angel
circle around the belfry?

40:07.360 --> 40:11.114
- ls that a man or a woman angel?
- l don't know.

40:16.760 --> 40:22.073
Well, reckon it don't make
much of a difference amongst angels.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.758
Well:

40:24.480 --> 40:27.790
- Give up?
- No. We'll play it out.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.798
That's my privilege. 25 cents.

40:30.920 --> 40:36.199
Oh, by the way, did Mr Rankin
pick up his supper this evening?

40:36.320 --> 40:38.436
No.

40:38.560 --> 40:41.677
He generally gets through
up there about now.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.756
Yes, l know.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.594
Gets dark earlier these days.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.629
Our man never did pick up his suitcase.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.830
- No.
- Strange.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.030
Ain't it, though?

41:18.160 --> 41:22.392
l've been tempted once or twice
to look and see what's inside it.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.476
{whispers} lt ain't even locked.

41:24.600 --> 41:28.639
- Seems to me you have a perfect right.
- You do?

41:30.840 --> 41:33.115
- l'd need a witness.
- That's me.

41:33.240 --> 41:38.360
lt is? That's all l wanted to know.
Let's see what's in there.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.876
Wonder what's in it?

41:43.160 --> 41:45.230
- Soiled linen.
- Uh-huh.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.873
- Sweater.
- Uh-huh.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.711
Soap and a razor wrapped in a towel
with ''SS Cristobal'' written across it.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.116
- A pair of old shoes.
- Yep.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.397
- Nothing but religious pamphlets.
- Yep, that's all.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.988
Evening, Mr Potter. Hello, Mr Wilson.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.873
- Mr Wilson, hi.
- Evening, Mr Rankin.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.039
Mr Potter and l have been poking our
noses into somebody else's business.

42:11.160 --> 42:15.597
That suitcase. That chap left it here
and he never did call back.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.996
- lt's been over two weeks.
- Did he say what he was doing here?

42:19.120 --> 42:21.680
No. Looked in the phone book,
didn't telephone.

42:21.800 --> 42:27.955
Funny-looking, he was. Scrawny with
big stary blue eyes and a queer walk.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.548
Like any second
he might break into a run.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.036
- Did he have a foreign accent?
- Why, yes. He did.

42:34.160 --> 42:37.072
Not so much of an accent
as a foreign way of talking.

42:37.200 --> 42:41.034
Do you happen to know
who he could be, Mrs Rankin?

42:41.160 --> 42:43.037
Why... why, no.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.910
l was just trying to
complete your mystery for you.

42:49.040 --> 42:53.670
Don't all foreign strangers
have to have foreign accents?

42:56.400 --> 42:58.789
- Mary, have you seen Red?
- Why, no.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.911
Not since l took him home to you.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.998
He's been spending all his time
out in the woods.

43:04.120 --> 43:08.159
- Thought you told me he never ran away.
- That's why Noah's so anxious.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.157
Come on, Mary.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.238
Good night, Mr Wilson. Night, Noah.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.073
Were you able to find out anything?

43:31.080 --> 43:36.279
Meinike did go to Rankin's house.
And your sister did see him.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.994
- Did Mary say so?
- She started to.

43:39.600 --> 43:45.232
Your sister's a fine woman, but she must
find out the kind of man she's married to.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.558
She wouldn't listen to anything
against him. Much less believe it.

43:49.680 --> 43:54.435
We must arrange it so that she finds out
for herself. Do you understand?

43:56.040 --> 43:57.359
Yes.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.994
lt's certain she knows nothing now.

44:00.120 --> 44:05.433
Except that he didn't want her to admit
having seen someone she did see.

44:05.560 --> 44:09.155
l'd give something to know
what explanation he's making now.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.910
l was a student in Geneva.
There was a girl.

44:15.960 --> 44:20.431
The night before l was to leave
we went out on the lake together.

44:20.560 --> 44:25.714
She told me unless l promised to
marry her she'd never return to shore.

44:25.840 --> 44:32.279
l thought she was joking, naturally,
but... she wasn't.

44:33.960 --> 44:38.112
Before l could stop her
she stood up in the boat, and...

44:41.320 --> 44:46.872
Well, l dived in after her
but it was too late, she was gone.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.470
Only one person knew we were
on the lake together. Her brother.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.832
He knew l hadn't murdered her,

44:52.960 --> 44:57.317
but he told me he'd be willing to
call it an accident for a compensation.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.079
l gave him all l had and left Switzerland.

45:00.200 --> 45:06.514
As the years went by l allowed myself
to believe the dead past really was dead.

45:06.640 --> 45:12.351
And then... on our wedding day, Mary,
he appeared again.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.233
Her brother. The little man.

45:18.320 --> 45:21.676
l gave him all the money
l had in the world.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.556
And he went away again.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.595
Oh, darling.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.756
You should have told me,

45:30.880 --> 45:35.237
and not carried this awful thing
around by yourself.

45:37.880 --> 45:43.034
You're a very wonderful person, Mary.
l love you very much.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.196
Oh, Charles.

45:53.920 --> 45:57.469
But... why didn't he
go back for his things?

45:59.160 --> 46:01.116
Well...

46:01.960 --> 46:05.999
l suppose once he had money
he could afford better.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.756
Darling, l'm terribly nervous.

46:08.880 --> 46:14.034
Think l'll work up in the clock alone
tonight, by myself. lt will calm me.

46:15.840 --> 46:20.391
- You understand, don't you?
- Of course l understand.

46:20.520 --> 46:25.355
- Shall l walk you home?
- No, dear. There's no need for that.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.076
- lt's late.
- That's all right.

46:29.200 --> 46:32.636
ln Harper there's nothing to be afraid of.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.996
l love you.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.436
Poor old Red.
He heard my whistle, l'll bet.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.072
He couldn't bark or anything.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.794
He just crawled this far and died.

47:02.840 --> 47:06.799
- Why do you think he died?
- Let's go and find out.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.474
That's young Longstreet's dog, Red.
Looks like he's dead to me.

47:21.600 --> 47:25.070
They're taking him up to
Dr Lawrence's office.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.589
Do you know anything about it?

47:27.720 --> 47:30.154
What in the world's happening?

47:30.280 --> 47:32.077
Checkers?

47:32.800 --> 47:35.030
No. No, thank you.

47:35.160 --> 47:37.116
That Coke's a nickel.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.316
Thank you, Mr Rankin.

47:52.680 --> 47:57.629
Doctor, how long could the dog
have lived with that amount of poison?

47:57.760 --> 48:00.718
Not more than a minute or so, l'd say.

48:01.720 --> 48:07.317
Then Red was poisoned within a few
hundred yards of where you found him.

48:07.440 --> 48:13.879
ln the latter part of the distance, he must
have been moving slower and slower.

48:17.040 --> 48:20.794
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Thanks, Jeff.

48:22.280 --> 48:26.432
Mr Peabody, would you get that
magazine rack in and hurry up about it?

48:26.560 --> 48:28.790
Yes, Mr Potter.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.753
Hurry up about it. Move along.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.713
Afternoon, Mr Wilson. Afternoon, Noah.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.798
Bring them right in there, Mr Peabody.

48:50.360 --> 48:56.196
What does the law say about this kind of
murder? ls it the same as killing a man?

48:56.320 --> 48:58.709
lt ought to be. lt's just as bad.

48:58.840 --> 49:02.913
Forepaws muddy. No mud on hind.

49:04.840 --> 49:07.274
Dry leaves mixed with the mud.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.475
Red must have been
digging in the woods.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.637
Have you any idea what for, Mr Wilson?

49:17.400 --> 49:20.676
A body, l think. Meinike's.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.756
The little man.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.678
Then...

49:39.080 --> 49:41.196
- You just caught me.
- Anything wrong?

49:41.320 --> 49:44.392
You mean closing up?
Just going on a search.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.715
- What are you after?
- Oil. What search?

49:46.840 --> 49:51.630
For the body. State police
deputised half the town. Fourth shelf.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.389
One misses the news up in the tower.
What body?

49:55.520 --> 50:01.356
My bet is, fella that left his bags here.
Scrawny little duck. Unhappy-looking.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.675
l knew he'd come to a bad end.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.554
That oil will be 1 5 cents.
l'll just put it on your account.

50:07.680 --> 50:09.636
{door shuts}

50:18.760 --> 50:21.194
Sara told me you were up here.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.834
Why are you packing?
Are we going somewhere?

50:24.960 --> 50:27.394
We aren't, dearest. l am.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.079
What?

50:30.200 --> 50:33.590
As a rule, men leave their wives
because they don't love them.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.712
l must leave you because l do.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.595
You won't object once you know
the kind of man you married.

50:44.480 --> 50:47.756
But you are the man l've married
and that's all that matters.

50:47.880 --> 50:52.158
Darling, l meant it
when l said for better or for worse.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.510
Even to...

50:54.640 --> 50:56.596
to killing Red?

51:01.480 --> 51:03.789
You couldn't have.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.909
- lt was an accident.
- No, l meant to kill him.

51:10.800 --> 51:16.909
Murder can be a chain, one link leading
to another until it circles your neck.

51:17.040 --> 51:20.919
Red was digging at the grave
of the man l killed.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.476
Yes, your little man.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.919
- You killed him?
- With these hands.

51:30.400 --> 51:36.157
The same hands that have held you close.
Now are you satisfied to let me go?

51:36.280 --> 51:38.589
Why? Why did you do it?

51:38.720 --> 51:42.030
l'd have given him all l had,
but his dreams were far grander.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.276
He knew your father was well-to-do.

51:44.400 --> 51:51.112
He knew he would be glad to protect you
from scandal for a few thousand dollars.

51:52.040 --> 51:58.479
l should have gone away and lost myself
in a world where he could never find me.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.557
But l loved you. And l was weak.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.196
Darling...

52:07.800 --> 52:10.917
lf one of us goes, we'll both go.

52:11.040 --> 52:15.192
You would have shared
half my trouble if l'd had any.

52:15.320 --> 52:19.677
Charles, what is there
to connect you with that man?

52:22.600 --> 52:27.435
Nothing, actually. You're the only one
that knows l knew him.

52:27.560 --> 52:30.836
Then you need have no fear.
lf l'm the only one who can speak.

52:30.960 --> 52:37.638
But, Mary, in failing to speak,
you become part of the crime.

52:38.240 --> 52:42.472
But l'm already a part of it,
because l'm a part of you.

52:45.960 --> 52:50.988
But you shudder at the touch of my hands
as though it was the touch of death.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.076
lt's nerves.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.151
Hold me close, Charles. Hold me close.

53:01.040 --> 53:03.713
Mr Peabody, open up the coroner's office.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.070
l knew darn well it was the same fella.

53:06.200 --> 53:10.352
Course he's changed some.
Being buried in the earth does it.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.677
Evening, Mr Wilson. Evening, Noah.

53:13.800 --> 53:17.429
- Evening, Mr Potter.
- A mess, ain't it?

53:17.560 --> 53:21.269
What do we do about Mary? We can't
leave her with him now we know.

53:21.400 --> 53:27.555
She realises now that whatever story
he told her about Meinike was false.

53:28.200 --> 53:33.035
Noah, l think your sister
should be ready to hear the truth.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.198
Charles.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.073
Will they make me look at the body?

53:43.080 --> 53:45.230
l shouldn't think so.

53:46.240 --> 53:50.995
Because l couldn't do it.
l mean, l don't think l could.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.429
See, l've never seen a dead person.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.118
l...

53:59.800 --> 54:03.270
- How many are you having to tea, Mary?
- 28 altogether.

54:03.400 --> 54:06.517
- You didn't eat nothing at dinner.
- lsn't that a lot?

54:06.640 --> 54:08.949
- 28 for just you and Sara?
- No.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.435
We'll manage all right.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.556
- But suppose l...
- What?

54:16.680 --> 54:21.231
l don't know. l'm terrified of
seeing anybody or being seen.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.715
You must get tight hold of yourself.

54:23.840 --> 54:27.594
To go through with this, you must know
what you're going to do and say.

54:27.720 --> 54:30.917
Perfect naturalness at all times.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.554
Now, darling, listen to me.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.636
- Darling...
- {phone}

54:37.680 --> 54:40.513
l am prepared to go to the police.

54:40.640 --> 54:44.315
- lt's your father, Miss Mary.
- Thank you, Sara.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.078
Mary...

54:57.360 --> 54:59.635
Hello?

54:59.760 --> 55:03.196
Yes, l think so. Just a minute and l'll see.

55:04.160 --> 55:07.550
- He wants me to come over.
- Did he ask me too?

55:08.440 --> 55:11.238
He said he wanted to see me alone.

55:11.360 --> 55:15.353
There's nothing unusual about
a father wanting to see his daughter.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.835
- ls there?
- No.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.678
All right. l'll be right over.

55:25.840 --> 55:29.753
- Don't you think that's rather strange?
- Strange? No.

55:29.880 --> 55:33.839
l'll go and work on the clock
while you're with your father.

55:33.960 --> 55:36.952
You can come by and pick me up later.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.594
l'm so afraid.

55:39.720 --> 55:43.713
He was so pointed about wanting to
see me alone. He sounded different.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.877
You know what you're
going to say, don't you?

56:04.440 --> 56:06.396
Come in, Mary.

56:09.320 --> 56:11.595
ls something wrong?

56:11.720 --> 56:17.317
Mr Wilson is here on a serious matter.
We must help him every way possible.

56:18.560 --> 56:21.597
He wants to ask a few questions of you.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.113
What do you want to know, Mr Wilson?

56:27.120 --> 56:31.193
You know about the body
that was discovered yesterday?

56:31.320 --> 56:32.878
Yes.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.834
- Did you ever meet the deceased?
- No, l never met him.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.073
Have you seen the body?

56:40.200 --> 56:41.758
No.

56:41.880 --> 56:45.077
Then how can you be sure
you've never met him?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.355
Of course l can't be certain.

56:50.440 --> 56:54.274
Do you suspect me of something?
lf so, what?

56:54.400 --> 56:56.436
Of shielding a murderer.

56:57.160 --> 57:00.038
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.115
Do you recognise this man?

57:03.240 --> 57:09.270
Konrad Meinike. Commander of one of
the more efficient concentration camps.

57:09.400 --> 57:13.279
You know him, don't you?
You have met him here in Harper.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.078
No, l've never seen that man, Mr Wilson.

57:19.840 --> 57:22.957
Judge, would you mind
putting out the lights?

57:23.080 --> 57:26.675
l've been showing him some films.
l'd like you to see them too.

57:26.800 --> 57:32.432
l'm on the Allied Commission
for the Punishment of War Criminals.

57:32.560 --> 57:38.112
lt's my job to bring Nazis to justice.
lt's that job that brought me to Harper.

57:42.800 --> 57:46.679
Surely you don't think that...
l've never...

57:46.800 --> 57:51.112
- l've never even seen a Nazi.
- You might without realising it.

57:51.240 --> 57:57.588
They look like other people and act like
other people, when it's to their benefit.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.510
A gas chamber.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.716
The candidates were given hot showers

58:04.840 --> 58:10.392
so that their pores would be open
and the gas would act more quickly.

58:11.480 --> 58:17.077
And this is a lime pit, in which men,
women and children were buried alive.

58:19.960 --> 58:22.269
Why do you want me
to look at these horrors?

58:22.400 --> 58:24.550
All this you're seeing...

58:27.000 --> 58:29.639
lt's all the product of one mind.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.316
The mind of a man named...

58:33.080 --> 58:36.675
- Franz Kindler.
- Franz Kindler?

58:36.800 --> 58:40.156
Yes. He was the most brilliant
of the younger Nazis.

58:40.840 --> 58:46.198
He conceived the theory of genocide,
mass depopulation of conquered lands.

58:46.320 --> 58:47.992
So no matter who won the war,

58:48.120 --> 58:52.033
Germany would be the strongest nation
in Europe, biologically speaking.

58:52.160 --> 58:57.632
Unlike Goebbels, Himmler and the rest,
Kindler had a passion for anonymity.

58:57.760 --> 59:00.593
The newspapers carried
no picture of him.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.712
Before he disappeared
he destroyed every evidence

59:03.840 --> 59:06.638
that might link him with his past.

59:06.760 --> 59:12.153
There's no clue to the identity of Kindler -
except one little thing.

59:12.280 --> 59:16.512
He has a hobby that almost
amounts to a mania. Clocks.

59:19.080 --> 59:22.231
So have lots of people. You yourself.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.477
l'm not quite finished, Mrs Rankin.

59:26.880 --> 59:31.271
ln prison in Czechoslovakia
a war criminal was awaiting execution.

59:31.400 --> 59:36.076
This was Konrad Meinike, one-time
executive officer for Franz Kindler.

59:36.200 --> 59:38.794
He was an obscenity
on the face of the earth.

59:38.920 --> 59:41.957
The stench of burning flesh
was in his clothes.

59:42.080 --> 59:46.835
But we gave him his freedom on the
chance that he might lead me to Kindler.

59:46.960 --> 59:51.795
He led me here.
And here l lost him.

59:51.920 --> 59:55.435
Until yesterday.
Your dog Red found him for me.

59:55.560 --> 59:59.075
But unfortunately Meinike
was dead and buried.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:06.675
Now, in all the world, there's only one
person who can identify Franz Kindler.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:14.432
The one who knows - knows definitely -
who Meinike came to Harper to see.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.395
No, he's not a Nazi.
My Charles is not a Nazi:

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.595
You were at Rankin's house
on the day you were married.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.278
- Yes.
- Did anyone come?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.279
- Not that l remember.
- Try hard. lt's not so long ago.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.312
- No one came.
- Were you alone all the time?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.670
- No.
- Who else was there?

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:47.796
Charles. He came after his last class and
we were together for more than an hour.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.472
You have nothing to link him with Kindler
except a wild suspicion. lt's ridiculous.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.319
You want to use me
to implicate him and you can't.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.399
You can't involve me in a lie
and that's all it is, is a lie.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.512
lt's a lie, you know. lt's a lie.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.676
Mary:

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.756
Wait a minute. Mary:

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.271
Mary:

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.356
Wait a minute, sister.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.676
That's better.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.553
You know that your welfare and Noah's
means more to me than anything.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.069
Yes, yes.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.478
We've got to face this thing
with complete honesty, sister.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:05.914
Your entire happiness may well depend
on your telling me the absolute truth.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:12.195
lf Mr Wilson is right and you have married
a criminal, then there is no marriage.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.630
There's no call upon
your loyalty as a wife.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.149
He's good.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.628
He's good. He wouldn't hurt anybody
except to protect somebody he loved.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.309
- He's good.
- Then the truth can't hurt him.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.559
Charles was not with you
that afternoon, sister.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.435
- l remember your saying so.
- You're against him too, Adam.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.429
You've never liked him. That's why you
don't believe me now. Leave us alone.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.757
He's not a Nazi.
He's not one of those people.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.393
Leave us alone.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.357
She has the facts now.
But she won't accept them.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.633
They're too horrible
for her to acknowledge.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.228
Not so much that Rankin
could be Kindler,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.309
but that she could ever have
given her love to such a creature.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.432
But we have one ally. Her subconscious.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.869
lt knows what the truth is
and is struggling to be heard.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.279
The will to truth within your daughter
is much too strong to be denied.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.269
Look here. lf he's not Charles Rankin
we should be able to expose him.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.678
l'm not interested in proving that
he isn't Rankin, only that he is Kindler.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.155
How do you propose to do that?

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.116
Through your daughter.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:49.474
She's headed for a breakdown. That's
the usual result of being inwardly divided.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.319
Rankin will see this.
That's what l'm banking on.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.433
He can't trust a person near hysteria.
He'll have to act.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.997
He may try to run before she collapses,
which would be an admission of guilt.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.190
- Or...
- Go on.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.036
He may kill her.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.638
You're shocked at my cold-bloodedness.
That's natural. You're her father.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.959
lt's because you are her father
that l'm talking to you like this.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.232
Naturally we'll try to prevent
murder being done.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.838
But the proof that murder is his aim would
be the strongest evidence she could have.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.428
{clock strikes}

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.156
Charles.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.873
Listen. lt's striking. After 100 years.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.037
lt was a trap, just like you said.
Mr Wilson was there.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.199
He tried to tell me you were a Nazi.
And l was supposed to believe it.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.029
lmagine you being an escaped Nazi:
He thinks he's clever, Wilson.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.596
He wanted me to tell him
about the little man.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.271
- Who did he say he thought l was?
- A Nazi. Franz Kindler.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.556
He made it all up to trick me.
But l didn't tell them anything.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.194
l outfaced both of them, Charles.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.551
lt'll be simple enough to prove
you're not that Nazi.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.639
We'll just find someone
who was in your class at college.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.399
lf what you say is true
he can't touch me.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.637
l'm quite safe if you say nothing.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:41.508
l won't. l promise l won't. They can
torture me and l won't tell them anything.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.031
Look. The chimes have awakened Harper.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.434
We must go down and greet them.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.030
- You must act naturally. Smile at them.
- Yes.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.391
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm all right.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.670
We'll face them, darling.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.151
And when she struck, that angel started
marching. lt was a sight to behold.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.795
- You knocked it off. My hat's off to you.
- Congratulations.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.956
Won't the rector be delighted:

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.392
lf she's going to chime all night long,
how's a body going to get any sleep?

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.592
We'll face them, darling. All of them.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.919
Them chickens of yours is going to be
on and off the roost every 1 5 minutes.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.109
Sara, l've told you
l want these curtains drawn.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.392
- The sunlight is bad for them.
- That's rubbish and you know it.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.355
- At the other house we didn't close them.
- This is my house and l want them drawn.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.996
Suit yourself, then. lt's going to look
mighty gloomy for the party.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.271
- ls it that time already?
- {doorbell}

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.711
Were you able to see
when they opened the grave?

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.675
- Not the most pleasant sight.
- There's Mary. Hello, Mary.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.473
Filling out prescriptions is something
l hate. Sleeping pills is another.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.398
- They're for Mrs Rankin.
- Want them wrapped?

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.511
- No.
- Don't approve of them.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.915
Man works, man gets a night's sleep.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.759
Or he could till that clock
started bonging.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.952
l believe Mrs Rankin
ordered some ice cream.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.915
Already gone. Fella said he was going
past your house so l gave it to him.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.190
Mr Wilson.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.517
- Mrs Rankin.
- {woman} Wouldn't leave the house alone.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.668
He might be anywhere, the murderer.
Waiting for a new victim.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.315
l hope you haven't forgotten
you were kind enough to invite me.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.955
- No, of course not.
- Mr Potter asked me to deliver this.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.756
- Good. Sara's waiting for it.
- l hope it hasn't melted.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.475
- l won't detain you any longer.
- l have a drink for you.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.559
- Just the medicine l need.
- You know Dr Hippard?

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.830
- Can l get you something else?
- Nothing more, thank you, dear.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.599
- Where's Doctor Rankin?
- He'll be here soon.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.871
- l want a word with him about that clock.
- Yes.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.916
May l get you some more tea?

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.795
..Jack the Ripper.
And what was that Frenchman's name?

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.390
There may well be ten or a dozen graves
out there in those woods.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.590
He was murdered just three weeks ago.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.269
- May l get you some more tea?
- Thank you, no.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:59.551
l forget what Emerson says about crime.
There's Rankin. He may know.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.274
- Sorry to be late.
- Darling.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:07.871
Hello there, Rankin.
You know the quotation. Emerson.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.877
''Commit a crime,
and the earth is made of glass.''

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.956
No, l don't.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.916
''Commit a crime,
and the earth is made of glass.''

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.996
Commit a crime...

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.032
''Commit a crime, and it seems as if
a coat of snow fell on the ground,

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:30.679
such as reveals in the woods the track of
every partridge and squirrel and mole.''

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.555
''You cannot recall the spoken word,
you cannot wipe out the foot-track,

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.832
you cannot draw up the ladder
so as to leave no inlet or clue.''

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:45.314
You're Mr Wilson, aren't you? You're
our No.1 suspect in our murder case.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.352
So far you're the only suspect.
Potter fingered you.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:52.268
He thinks you committed the crime
to get possession of some antique.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:57.758
{woman} l wish you'd let that clock alone.
Harper was a nice quiet place.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.148
- Mary, what's Wilson doing here?
- l don't know.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.319
- You invited him. What's he after?
- l don't know.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.916
- Are you all right?
- Yes, quite all right.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.156
- Remember Friday, Mary.
- Yes, all right.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.590
- May l help you, dear?
- No.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.796
No: No, no:

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.030
- Mary, Mary...
- {sobs}

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.117
lt's all right, dear. lt's all right.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.309
lt broke, and the beads
fell all over the floor.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.470
He took her upstairs.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.595
- When l left l could still hear her crying.
- The floodgates have opened.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.473
Her subconscious has almost won.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.235
From now on we must know
every move that Mrs Rankin makes.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.796
She's never to leave the house
unless l know where she's going.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.233
lf l can't be found she's to be detained,
no matter on what pretext.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.316
Don't worry. She won't get by me.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.398
When she snapped those beads
it was her death warrant.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.353
We're carrying her life in our hands.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:32.230
Every time she walks on a slippery
sidewalk, is near something that can fall,

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.751
drives an automobile - anything that
could result in an accidental death -

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.440
her life is in danger.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.516
She won't get by me.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.996
{sawing}

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.116
{clock strikes}

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.076
{bell rings}

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.510
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.031
Today we will finish with
the career of Friedrich der Groâe,

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.393
Konig von Preuâen, Kurfurst
von Brandenburg, Prinz von Polen.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.750
Frederick the Great to you.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.796
- 862, please.
- {Potter} That'll be 85 cents.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.076
{whistles softly}

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.119
- Hello?
- {softly} Hello, Mary.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.996
Mary, this is Charles.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.836
Can you hear me, dear?

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.191
l can't speak loudly,
but l want you to understand this.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.030
Something very important has come up.
Come to the church immediately.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.153
- The church tower. Understand?
- Yes, l understand.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.953
l don't want anybody to know
you're going there.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:53.918
Don't tell anybody. Leave your car in the
rear and come in through the back door.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.474
OK? All right, then.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.915
- Peabody:
- Coming.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.719
Stack that wood down there,
then get back to work.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.796
Yes, sir.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.116
{logs clatter}

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.076
Watch that, Mr Peabody.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.878
Your move, Professor.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.436
Going someplace?

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.590
Where to?

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.154
- l asked you where you was going.
- l heard.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.998
Well?

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.271
You forget l am no longer a child.
l'm a married woman.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.631
Well, you ain't been married very long.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.236
Wait, Mrs Rankin.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.755
- What is it? l'm in a hurry.
- No need to go biting my head off:

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.000
- What is it, Sara?
- Well, l...

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.712
- lf you've got something to say, say it.
- l don't know what's got into you.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.513
You never was mean to me
back at the old house.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.599
Maybe l've outworn my usefulness.
l'm not as young as l used to be.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.757
- Maybe you don't want me around.
- Don't talk nonsense.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:22.034
lt's true and you know it.
l'm going to pack my things and leave.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.314
l'm sorry if l've hurt your feelings.
l didn't mean to, really l didn't.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.873
Sara...

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.231
l couldn't get along without you.
You know that, don't you?

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.237
- Well, don't you?
- Honest?

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.352
- Honestly. Cross my...
- Oh, Miss Mary.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.073
Please, wait just a minute.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.033
Sara, you'll never leave me, will you?

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.355
- You know how l feel about you.
- Yes.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.438
Like you was my own daughter.
My own little girl.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.711
l've got to go now. Really.
l've promised to be somewhere.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.990
Well, where to, Miss Mary?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.432
Stop fussing, Sara.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.476
lt's a secret.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.551
{screams} Miss Mary:

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.510
What's the matter?

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.474
My heart. l can't breathe. The pain:

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.149
No, Miss Mary. Please don't leave me.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.350
Lie right there and keep quiet.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.517
- Maybe l'm dying.
- You're not dying.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.795
- Stay with me.
- l won't leave you.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.319
1 30, please.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.069
Yes, Mary?

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.637
l was supposed to meet Charles
at the clock tower and l can't get there.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.832
Will you go and tell him
to please wait for me?

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.795
Noah, no one's to know where
or why you're going. lt's important.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.556
All right.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.916
238, please.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.319
May l speak to Mr Wilson?

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.396
{whistles}

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.114
- Looks like it's coming up for snow.
- Yes, that's right.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.196
{whistles}

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.916
lsn't it after hours? You ladies
are working too hard at the library.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.589
Oh, no, Mr Rankin,
we closed as usual at 3.30.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.158
You're perfectly right.
l dismissed class ten minutes early.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.589
lt's 3.44.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.430
l was playing checkers with Mr Potter
and l didn't realise.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:06.509
You know what you are?
You're the absent-minded professor.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.556
{clock chimes}

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.158
- You sure are lucky today.
- l am.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.919
- Mr Potter.
- Afternoon, Mr Hill.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:51.430
- l can't find the earmuffs.
- Right over there by the mittens.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.473
- Come on, help us look.
- l'll be right back.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.718
Right over there by that box.
Latest thing out.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.392
- How much?
- 85 cents.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.479
- That's an awful lot.
- They come high this year.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.552
- You want this thing?
- l'll keep it.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.434
You're a bad influence. l intended
only to spend a couple of minutes.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.752
- Look what time it is.
- Yeah. l'd like to get even.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.268
lt's your move.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:31.033
He really had the wind up. You can
still smell the glue where he joined it.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.957
Look at that.
Like l told you, it's coming up for snow.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.316
Look here, Professor.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.230
Double or nothing?

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.316
{clock strikes}

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.074
- Afternoon, Mr Potter.
- Afternoon, Professor.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.396
{Mary} Charles?

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.870
- You didn't go the church.
- No. Sara...

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.197
- What about Sara?
- Sara had some kind of an attack.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:06.271
She's resting now. Jeff said it wasn't very
serious, but that l should stay with her.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.918
- What's the matter, Charles?
- Nothing's the matter.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.795
Then why did you want me to go to
the church? You said it was important.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.150
lt wasn't. Nothing, actually.

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.637
lt's my sense of proportion
has failed me these days.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.955
Please, Charles. What is it?

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.396
l'm sorry.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.357
l've just begun to feel the strain.
You see, l have my weak moments too.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.719
l'll tell you in my own good time.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.513
- Have they found out anything more?
- Nothing to find out. Unless you...

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.838
- l haven't seen anybody all day.
- l heard there's an arrest to be made.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:06.715
My head aches. The incident with
the beads made me doubt your strength.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:13.279
l thought maybe you'd gone to your father
and told him something. lf you had...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.629
- You didn't have to be afraid.
- No?

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.274
- What did you tell Noah?
- What about?

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.233
- Didn't you see him?
- Why should l see Noah?

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.033
- Did you come from the church?
- Are we in court?

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.994
No, but l told Noah to go there
and tell you l was detained.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.396
l told you not to call anybody.
Call him and tell him not to go.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.317
- l can't.
- Call him, l say:

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.557
- He's gone:
- lf he dies, his blood is on your hands.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.240
- What?
- lt's your meddling that's done this.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.955
lt would have been all right
if it wasn't for you.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.992
But you had to be here. On that day.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.874
- Hanging your stupid curtains:
- Did you kill Noah?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.437
Yes, if he goes to the church
and climbs up that ladder:

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.038
- lt was l you intended to kill, wasn't it?
- No.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.116
Why wasn't it l?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.756
Franz Kindler:

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.756
Kill me. Kill me, l want you to.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.112
l couldn't face life knowing what l've been
to you and what l've done to Noah.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.949
But when you kill me
don't put your hands on me.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.152
Here. Use this.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.756
{Noah} Mary.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.038
Noah:

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.709
{Wilson} Operator.
Get me the state police.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.796
{clock strikes}

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.110
Yes, the roadblocks are up.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.037
We're watching the railroad station
and he isn't hiding in the woods.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.794
Judge Longstreet:

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.637
Get Wilson, Noah. l'll go for the police.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.994
lf he is where l think he is,
it'll be easy.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.511
- We'll do all we can to take him alive.
- She's gone.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.791
- She's not in the house.
- Clock tower?

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.278
l don't know.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.110
lf that's where he's hiding
and she gets there before us...

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:35.870
- What'll we do?
- Call Captain Samuels and the deputies.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.152
{groans} Ouch:

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.475
- The church:
- What about you?

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.910
l'll get there. Hurry up.
Your sister may be still alive.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.232
{Rankin} Don't move. l have a gun.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.352
You don't need it. l'm alone.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.157
- What are you doing here?
- Lift me up.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.309
- You're telling the truth?
- Why should l lie?

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.038
- You were followed here?
- l came by our way.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.197
Through the cemetery. No one saw me.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.876
{clock chimes}

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.551
l needed the excuse.
l was afraid you wouldn't let me up.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.517
- What do you want?
- l came to kill you.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.799
{laughs}

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.230
No, Mary, it's you that's going to die.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.909
You were meant to fall
through that ladder.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.796
You're going to fall.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.235
l don't mind, if l take you with me.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.636
You are a fool.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.548
They searched the woods.
l watched them.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.194
Like God looking at little ants.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.834
l'll hide in the woods.
They won't look again.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.679
When they find me
they'll know you're still here.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.110
You were on the verge of a breakdown.
Now you've cracked.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.995
Why else would you leave your bed,
climb here in the dead of night?

01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:00.672
- Any child could see you'd kill yourself.
- Killing is what led you here.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.516
lt won't help you now.

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.108
Look out the window. Look:

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.799
That's an old trick. A very poor trick.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.515
Tricks: That's all you know, is tricks.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:20.316
l don't need any tricks. No matter what
happens to me tricks will do you no good.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.678
You're finished, Herr Franz Kindler.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.750
The citizens of Harper.
They've come after you.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.395
The plain, ordinary people,
the ones you've been laughing at.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.511
Well, you can't fool them any more.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.269
Sure, you can kill me, Mary,
half the people down there.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.436
But there's no escape.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.597
The world closed in on you
till there was only Harper.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:56.075
That closed in
and there was only this room.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.794
And this room too is closing in on you.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.914
lt's not true, the things they say l did.
l followed orders.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:08.192
- You gave the orders.
- l only did my duty.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.150
Don't send me back there.
l'm not a criminal.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.350
You are.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.796
Give me that gun:

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.151
{gun clicks}

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.553
{screaming}

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.320
All right, Mary's safe.
Let me give you a hand.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.159
- No, thanks.
- What happened?

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.637
- V-day in Harper.
- l don't get that. Come on down.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.274
No, not until you get me a new ladder.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.392
l've had my ankle busted
and my head conked.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.435
- From here on in l'm taking it easy.
- l'll get you another ladder.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.630
You've had enough trouble.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.672
Good night, Mary. Pleasant dreams.
