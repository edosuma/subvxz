renaming it

the "Louis
Driscoll award."

03:08.680 --> 03:09.960
Louis, do you
have to be

03:09.960 --> 03:10.880
so conceited?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.040
Everybody's
got a chance.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.120
Dream on, Alex.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.080
She's right.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.720
Alex and I have
been planning

03:15.720 --> 03:16.800
a serious
film project

03:16.800 --> 03:17.720
for a long time.

03:17.720 --> 03:18.680
We have?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.760
Sure, it's
going to be huge.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.760
Competition.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.880
It's everything wrong

03:22.880 --> 03:24.000
with our country.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.600
Are you entering
the contest, Robyn?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.720
Are you kidding?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.920
Lay more rejection
upon myself?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.000
I don't
think so.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.800
Hey, Louis

03:31.800 --> 03:32.840
who's your
partner?

03:32.840 --> 03:34.240
Me? I'm
flying solo.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.680
Although I will need

03:35.680 --> 03:37.320
someone to hold my camera.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.120
Produced, written, starring

03:39.120 --> 03:40.320

<i> Louis Driscoll.</i>

<i>Vince: Oh, it's in its
early stages of development.</i>

03:48.440 --> 03:52.360
This device will one day
be able to seek out

03:52.360 --> 03:55.520
the most minuscule
traces of GC-161

04:00.800 --> 04:02.560
This I've
got to see.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.560
As I say

04:03.560 --> 04:06.040
there are still
some kinks

04:06.040 --> 04:07.520
that need to be
worked out.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.600
<i>( Zapping and beeping )</i>

04:30.200 --> 04:31.560
This is some

04:31.560 --> 04:33.320
beautiful machine.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.040
It appears to need

04:35.040 --> 04:37.240
some minor adjustments.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.760
Want me to take

04:38.760 --> 04:40.960
a crack at it, Vince?

04:40.960 --> 04:41.920
Look, Vince

04:41.920 --> 04:43.480
if you insist
on working out

04:43.480 --> 04:45.000
every tiny
little detail

04:45.000 --> 04:46.240
about this machine

04:46.240 --> 04:47.320
that's up to you.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.400
Personally

04:48.400 --> 04:50.240
I'm under a great
deal of pressure

04:50.240 --> 04:51.320
to find that child.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.840
Now.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.120
I understand.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.560
Hi.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
Hey.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.520
How was your day?

05:08.520 --> 05:09.440
It's not over.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.760
I came to drop
some stuff off

05:10.760 --> 05:11.760
then I'm
heading back

05:11.760 --> 05:12.560
to the library.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.680
Um...

05:13.680 --> 05:14.200
Mom.

05:14.200 --> 05:14.920
Yeah?

05:14.920 --> 05:15.720
Excuse me.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.680
Oh, um.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.320
Annie, before
you go upstairs

05:18.320 --> 05:21.280
there's someone that
wants to say hello.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.200
Who?

05:22.200 --> 05:23.520
Hello, hello

05:23.520 --> 05:24.400
hello.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.880
Is that my
little Annie?

05:26.880 --> 05:28.240
<i>( Laughing )</i>

05:28.240 --> 05:31.720
Hi, Grandma.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.760
Look at you.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.840
What a beautiful
young woman you are.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.520

something on your face.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
It's a pimple, Grandma.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.160
Is it?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.400
Well...

05:44.400 --> 05:47.400
Actually, it looks
very good on you.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.360
A pimple.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.880
It looks good on me.

Â¶ Is like a melody... Â¶

05:53.920 --> 05:57.240
Just for a couple
more days.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.800
Hello.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.840
I'm Louis Driscoll.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.960
Welcome to "Trust."

06:02.960 --> 06:04.600
Ever notice how human beings

06:04.600 --> 06:06.560
don't trust each
other these days?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.360
How relationships can be ruined

06:08.360 --> 06:10.600
by a single harmless rumor
or innuendo?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.040
Let me show you what I mean.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.960
Excuse me.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
You're Kelly, right?

06:15.960 --> 06:16.840
Uh-huh.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.720
<i>And who are you?</i>

06:17.720 --> 06:18.920
That's not important.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.320
What's important is that

06:20.320 --> 06:21.400
Scott's decided to

06:21.400 --> 06:22.480
break up with you.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.680
What?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.760
He feels you

06:25.760 --> 06:26.840
aren't working as a couple.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.920
He'd like to end it now.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.880
Why wouldn't he
tell me himself?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.360
He didn't
have the guts.

06:32.360 --> 06:36.680
He paid me 20 bucks
to do it for him.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.840
See what I mean?

06:38.840 --> 06:41.040
A girl who has no reason

06:41.040 --> 06:42.400
to believe anything I say

06:42.400 --> 06:44.120
has gone to beat up
her boyfriend

06:44.120 --> 06:45.560
because of one little lie.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.000
Amazing, isn't it?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.560
Now let's visit Coach Rooney.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.080
Will it mean anything to him

06:50.080 --> 06:51.680
if he thinks he's
been offered a spot

06:51.680 --> 06:54.080
a spot on the Dallas
Cowboys' coaching staff?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.000
Let's find out.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Hey, guys.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.600
Nice basketball.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.720
In fact, I think
that one's mine.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.360
Hey, let's get him!

07:04.400 --> 07:05.600
Ray:
I can't believe

07:05.600 --> 07:07.280
you don't love this idea.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.080
It's not that.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.040
I just don't see

07:09.040 --> 07:10.320
how we can
put together

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
a mountain biking

07:11.320 --> 07:12.720
action-adventure
thriller

07:12.720 --> 07:15.040
in two days.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.440
What was your idea?

07:16.440 --> 07:19.240
An inside-the-mind-
of-a-genius type thing.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.800
A documentary
on Annie.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.160
You want to put
the class to sleep?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.440
What's wrong?

07:26.440 --> 07:27.960
The battery
is dead.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.440
<i>( Zapping )</i>

07:29.440 --> 07:30.120
Cool.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.960
Alex, trust me.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.760
We'll be awesome.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.480
You won't regret it.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.680
Vince:
If it works out here

07:37.680 --> 07:38.800
it's ready.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
Did you put

07:39.800 --> 07:40.960
the GC-161
container

07:40.960 --> 07:42.200
where I
told you to?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.160
Sure did.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.160
Good.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.160
Look through
the viewfinder.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.120
Turn it on.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.840
And tell me
what you see.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.800
I see...

07:54.800 --> 07:57.760
A very large orange.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.200
Put it down, Dave.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.160
Carefully.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.720
Now back off.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.320
Further.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.880
Just...
keep going.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.080
Here you go.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.320
George,
you're looking

08:16.320 --> 08:20.120
more handsome than
I've ever seen you.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.560
Thanks, Mom.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.480
So when do you
think you'll be

08:24.480 --> 08:26.640
running that
Chemical Plant?

08:26.640 --> 08:27.760
Uh... never?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.200
Grandma:
Oh, that's not true!

08:29.200 --> 08:31.920
Don't you sell yourself short.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.320
Actually, Mom, we were

08:33.320 --> 08:34.320
kind of
thinking

08:34.320 --> 08:35.640
that Annie
might have

08:35.640 --> 08:36.640
a better chance at it.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.200
Grandma:
Annie!

08:38.200 --> 08:39.640
Running a
Chemical Plant!

08:39.640 --> 08:41.480
Oh, and here I saw her

08:41.480 --> 08:44.840
as a supreme court justice
or something.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.040
I'm studying
science

08:46.040 --> 08:48.320
Grandma, not law.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.120
Don't be silly.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.280
You can be
anything

08:50.280 --> 08:51.600
you set
your mind to.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.840
Bea, I think

08:53.840 --> 08:57.680
this is the most magnificent
coffee I've ever tasted.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.880
Look into
the camera.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.440
You're hot.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.720
You're tired.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.200
And you're being chased

09:10.200 --> 09:12.400
and you got away
for a little bit

09:12.400 --> 09:13.520
but not for long.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.240
Take a drink of your water.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.360
Cut.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.520
Alex, you're glowing.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.600
I can't help it.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.320
I glow when I get nervous.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.280
We'll try it again, okay?

09:25.280 --> 09:27.440
Why don't you back up
for a bigger shot?

09:27.440 --> 09:28.480
Then you won't see the glow.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.280
Hmm...

09:29.280 --> 09:31.640
We could
use something

09:31.640 --> 09:32.880
panoramic.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.920
V.D.V. Power.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.440
<i>( Beeping )</i>

09:40.440 --> 09:41.760
All right.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.760
Plutonium
power module.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.000
<i>( Beeping faster )</i>

09:46.000 --> 09:47.440
All right.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.440
Here we go.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.720
<i>( Zapping )</i>

09:56.920 --> 09:58.280
Look at that.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.600
It located the GC-161

10:00.600 --> 10:01.960
immediately.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.920
Can we go now?

10:02.920 --> 10:04.520
You really don't understand

10:04.520 --> 10:06.440
the importance of this, do you?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.480
If we find the kid

10:07.480 --> 10:08.640
does it mean a raise

10:08.640 --> 10:09.920
and promotion for me?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.040
You mean...

10:11.040 --> 10:13.840
What happens if you're
no longer needed?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.040
Oh-ho.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.960
We have big plans
for you then, Dave.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.600
<i>( Beeping )</i>

10:18.600 --> 10:20.280
What's this?

10:20.280 --> 10:21.920
It's onto someone!

10:21.920 --> 10:24.080
Let's move, Dave!

10:24.080 --> 10:25.240
<i> Move!</i>

10:27.640 --> 10:28.920
Move, Dave!

10:35.960 --> 10:38.600
Vince:
Come on.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.000
Come on!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.280
<i>( Starts engine )</i>

10:42.600 --> 10:43.240
<i>( Sizzling )</i>

10:43.240 --> 10:44.040
What're you...

10:44.040 --> 10:45.960
Let's go!

10:48.680 --> 10:51.600
Ray:
Alex, do you read me? Over.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.800
I read you. Over.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.400
Alex, remember

10:56.400 --> 10:57.920
you have to show

10:57.920 --> 11:00.120
fear, like you're being chased.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.240
I know, I know.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.000
Can you even see me up there?

11:03.000 --> 11:03.960
Sure.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.560
This camera

11:05.560 --> 11:07.520
has a killer zoom lens.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.640
Alex, run!

11:13.640 --> 11:15.880
Ray, I think the word
is "action."

11:15.880 --> 11:16.920
No, in front of you!

11:28.440 --> 11:29.400
<i>( Yells )</i>

11:56.320 --> 11:57.360
<i>( Tires squealing )</i>

12:01.920 --> 12:03.680
Where did he go?

12:03.680 --> 12:06.040
He was right here.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.400
I can't believe it!

12:08.400 --> 12:10.120
Me, neither!

12:10.120 --> 12:10.840
Ow!

12:11.680 --> 12:13.520
I'm sorry, Vince.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.200
<i>( Grumbling )</i>

12:42.680 --> 12:45.120
Alex, that was amazing.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.040
Let's get out of here.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.640
That was nice.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.400
Coach Rooney seemed pleased.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.160
Of course, when he learns
the Dallas Cowboys

12:53.160 --> 12:54.600
never even heard of him

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
it may sting a bit.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.080
But he will have learned,
as we all have

12:58.080 --> 12:59.400
a very important lesson

12:59.400 --> 13:00.120
about Trust.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.040
<i>Excuse me.</i>

13:01.040 --> 13:01.840
Oh. Hi.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.400
So, are you the kid

13:03.400 --> 13:06.640
that gave my friend
Kelly a message?

13:06.640 --> 13:07.920
Kelly... um,
I'm not sure.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.160
Yeah,
that's him.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.360
<i>Atron:
Tell me again.</i>

13:17.360 --> 13:19.520
What did you see?

13:19.520 --> 13:21.000
It might have been
a couple of kids.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.240
It might not have.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.120
Our investigation
turned up

13:24.120 --> 13:25.480
bicycle
tire tracks

13:25.480 --> 13:26.800
but of
common tread

13:26.800 --> 13:29.600
impossible
to trace.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.800
There's no
other evidence?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.840
We were so close.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.640
I know.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.160
Oh, Vince.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.280
I forgot
to tell you.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.600
I found this
out there.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.560
Mom.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
Dad.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.760
Okay.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.160
Yes!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.600
I can't wait to see this.

14:01.360 --> 14:01.880
Let's play.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.920
Hooray!

14:02.920 --> 14:04.240
<i>( Toots )</i>

14:04.240 --> 14:05.320
What's that?

14:05.320 --> 14:06.560
Oh, that's my cousin's
birthday party.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.240
I taped over it.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.200
Yay!

14:10.160 --> 14:11.160
I can't help it.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.480
I glow when I get nervous.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.560
Oh, great.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.320
We can just edit out that part.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.640
Wow!

14:18.640 --> 14:20.160
You got all this
on camera?

14:20.160 --> 14:23.280
Louis has no chance
against this stuff.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.040
Forget it, Ray.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.800
This is way too dangerous
to show to anyone.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.600
Then what do you suggest?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.240
What about the Annie
documentary?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.200
Oh, please.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.560
That's a terrible idea.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.480
And we're running
out of time.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.840
Grandma:
Is that little Ray?

14:39.840 --> 14:41.280
Ray Alvarado.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.400
Let me look at you.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.040
The whole day
with Grandma, huh?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.760
Sounds painful.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.160
My mouth hurts from
smiling so much.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.400
I can't believe

14:53.400 --> 14:55.880
what an outstanding
young man you've become!

14:55.880 --> 14:56.760
Uh... thanks.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.040
I hear the two of you

14:58.040 --> 15:00.080
have been out together
all day long

15:00.080 --> 15:01.800
making your own little movie.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.680
Is that right?

15:02.680 --> 15:03.560
Sort of.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.920
Oh, how exciting.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.520
You've got to let me see
what you've done.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.400
Well, it's not
quite ready yet.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.520
We still have to
edit it and stuff.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.360
Let me know when I can see it.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.920
Say, I'll bet the both
of you are hungry.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.960
Can I make you
a little sandwich?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.240
Oh, no,
that's okay.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.080
That's okay.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.200
Oh, good!

15:21.200 --> 15:22.640
It'll only
take a second!

15:22.640 --> 15:23.560
Wow.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.600
Your grandmother's
happiness

15:25.600 --> 15:27.040
is unstoppable.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.280
Weird, isn't it?

15:28.280 --> 15:29.320
Yeah.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.560
She's the complete
opposite of Robyn.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.160
Yeah, that's true.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.760
Ray, I think
I have an idea.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.080
Grandma?

15:39.080 --> 15:41.040
Yes, dear?

15:41.040 --> 15:46.800
Would you like
to be in our movie?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.040
Alex:
Welcome

15:48.040 --> 15:49.280
to "black and white world"

15:49.280 --> 15:51.600
with Robyn Russo
and Abigail Hoffman

15:51.600 --> 15:53.440
two people who see the world

15:53.440 --> 15:55.080
in slightly different ways.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.040
Hello.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.360
We're here on
a gorgeous day

15:59.360 --> 16:02.200
in Danielle Atron Park.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.720
It's a beautiful, green park.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.880
A place to play.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.000
A place to make friends.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.000
A place to relax.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.880
Lovely, isn't it?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.640
Lovely?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.000
I see killer bees.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.200
<i>( Angry buzzing )</i>

16:26.200 --> 16:27.080
I see pollen.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.480
<i>( Sneezing )</i>

16:29.480 --> 16:32.440
And ragweed.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.040
I see the hot,
lethal sun

16:34.040 --> 16:35.920
pouring through
the ozone hole

16:35.920 --> 16:37.080
slowly killing us.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.320
<i>( Sizzling )</i>

16:38.320 --> 16:41.400
Roasting like
a pig on a spit.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.680
And these people are
supposedly having fun?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.720
What a strange...

16:47.720 --> 16:51.560
Yet intriguing
young girl you are.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.120
<i>( Door shuts )</i>

16:57.120 --> 16:58.080
News?

16:58.080 --> 16:59.160
Yes.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.320
I called all the
local camera stores

17:01.320 --> 17:03.360
to inquire about
the lens cap.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.480
And they told me

17:04.480 --> 17:05.880
they've been
renting out

17:05.880 --> 17:07.319
a lot of cameras lately

17:07.319 --> 17:08.520
for a video contest

17:08.520 --> 17:10.119
being held at
Atron Junior High.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.119
The kid?

17:11.119 --> 17:12.240
<i>( Thumping on door )
Yes.</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:14.359
The kid was possibly
filming in the field

17:14.359 --> 17:15.680
and dropped
the lens cap.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.560
When do they screen
this project?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.000
<i> I found it!
Later today.</i>

17:19.000 --> 17:20.800
Contact the school
immediately.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.200
Consider it done.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.720
<i>( Air seal gasps )</i>

17:28.720 --> 17:31.480
<i>( School bell ringing )</i>

17:31.480 --> 17:32.640
Alex, I'm
asking you

17:32.640 --> 17:33.680
for the
last time.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.840
Please let me show
the action stuff.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.600
I can win.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.080
Ray, forget it.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.760
So. You guys
ready to lose?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.880
Louis, what
happened to you?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.120
What? This?

17:44.120 --> 17:45.640
Let's just say
some people

17:45.640 --> 17:47.320
don't enjoy taking part

17:47.320 --> 17:48.920
in the creative process.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.160
<i>( Door opening )</i>

18:07.600 --> 18:09.800
Before we screen
the projects

18:09.800 --> 18:10.920
we have some

18:10.920 --> 18:13.240
very good news
for the entrants.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.120
Ms. Atron.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.520
Atron:
Class, as you know

18:16.520 --> 18:18.760
the Paradise Valley
Chemical Plant

18:18.760 --> 18:20.960
cares deeply
about our community.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.920
And of course

18:21.920 --> 18:24.040
about its children.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.320
Therefore, Mr. Dabensky
has allowed me to offer

18:27.320 --> 18:28.680
an additional prize

18:28.680 --> 18:30.480
of a $5,000
savings bond

18:30.480 --> 18:31.600
to the winner.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.400
<i>( Applause )</i>

18:36.200 --> 18:39.440
And he's also been
gracious enough

18:39.440 --> 18:42.640
to allow me
to be the sole judge.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.920
Mr. Dabersky:
Okay.

18:45.920 --> 18:51.120
Our first entry belongs to
Raymond Alvarado and Alex Mack.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.640
Your tape, please.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.680
Showtime.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
<i>( Children cheering )</i>

19:42.200 --> 19:44.480
Um... Mr. Dabersky.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.240
Please wait till
the screening's over

19:47.240 --> 19:49.080
before commenting, Alex.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.800
<i>( Children chattering )</i>

19:52.800 --> 19:56.560
<i>( Children squealing )</i>

19:56.560 --> 19:57.400
<i>( Zapping )</i>

20:04.960 --> 20:06.120
It sounded like

20:06.120 --> 20:07.920
a short of some kind.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.960
I can't get the tape out.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.160
Uh... that's okay.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.800
We can show it tomorrow.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.000
No, this is the school's
only working V.C.R.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.680
We may have to delay
the contest.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.480
Uh, Mr. uh...

20:20.480 --> 20:22.640
Dubersky.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.640
Right. We have someone
at the Plant

20:24.640 --> 20:26.680
who is very good
at V.C.R. Repair.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.080
Since Miss Atron
is judging the contest

20:29.080 --> 20:31.640
why don't we just take
the entries with us

20:31.640 --> 20:33.280
and she can judge them there?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.720
We can screen them

20:34.720 --> 20:36.200
for the next class.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.760
Yeah, I don't
see why not.

20:38.760 --> 20:39.720
Terrific.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.160
What a shame. Well.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.120
We'll see you next time, kids.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.640
When we announce the winner.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.640
Alex.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.880
Could I go to the bathroom?

20:48.880 --> 20:50.440
Yeah, go ahead.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.560
It's been
a pleasure.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.920
You were wonderful
in there, Miss Atron.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.760
Thanks, Vince.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.000
You're welcome.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.120
<i>Ray:
I can't believe Louis won</i>

21:23.120 --> 21:25.560
and we were disqualified.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.960
We had the better piece.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.240
Too bad it wasn't entered.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.680
Sure. Too bad.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.120
We were disqualified?

21:34.120 --> 21:35.000
We didn't enter?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I thought

21:36.000 --> 21:37.800
the tape was stuck
in the V.C.R.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.240
Alex:
It's a long story.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.520
It was the wrong tape

21:40.520 --> 21:43.160
and somehow when they
got it back to the Plant

21:43.160 --> 21:44.120
it wasn't there.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.680
Something always goes wrong.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.840
Always.

21:46.840 --> 21:51.040
Grandma: Hey, hey,
hey! Look who's here.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.640
So, how did we do?

21:53.640 --> 21:55.080
We were
disqualified.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.360
Our director here

21:56.360 --> 21:58.480
forgot to hand in
our tape.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.920
Forgot... so it
could be worse.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.480
What if we had
entered and lost?

22:03.480 --> 22:07.360
Wouldn't that
be worse?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.720
Yeah, I guess
it would.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.840
Of course
it would.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.480
A friend of
yours is here.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.160
Who?

22:13.160 --> 22:14.760
Hey, hey, you guys.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.760
<i>Check this out.</i>

22:16.760 --> 22:17.960
What?

22:21.080 --> 22:24.160
<i>( Kids shouting )</i>

22:24.160 --> 22:29.200
Aren't they
the nicest kids?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.760
Even that red one.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.840
Yeah.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.720
They're great.
