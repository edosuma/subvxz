01:18.160 --> 01:19.912
Here we go.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.196
- That was a great family day.
- Yeah.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.710
- Thanks for taking us with you, Al.
- Why don't we do this more often?

01:32.920 --> 01:35.195
Well, it's not every day
an uncle dies...

01:35.400 --> 01:38.073
...and the coroner forgets
to lock his house.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.355
It teaches you a lot
about human nature, though.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.710
I wouldn't believe
that kind of greed existed...

01:44.920 --> 01:46.717
...if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.639
Those vultures.
Like your cousin Sheila...

01:49.840 --> 01:53.037
...trying to take both of these TVs.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.318
Boy, the nerve of some people.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.750
So, kids, how'd you do?

02:02.680 --> 02:05.956
Now, wait a minute.
That wasn't in Uncle Joe's closet.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.872
I know, but there were too many people
stealing in there...

02:09.080 --> 02:11.469
...so I went upstairs
to his wife's room.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.993
But she's still alive.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.232
Well, she should have thought of that
before I took it.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.188
Look what I got.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.595
A gold tooth.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.958
That's not really gold, honey.
It's just yellow.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.272
In fact, we call it "Bundy yellow."

02:31.720 --> 02:33.790
Show him, honey.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.868
Damn. Great, now I have nothing.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.790
Well, cheer up, son.
I hear Aunt Addie's real sick.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.390
You mean, the one with the really
nice lamp? Oh, I'd love to have that.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.275
- Maybe for my birthday?
- Consider it done.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.958
- Hey, what'd you get, Daddy?
- The only thing I wanted, pumpkin.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.754
That is, besides from
Uncle Joe's mistress.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.916
I got Uncle Joe's watch.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.031
Uncle Joe wanted me to have
this watch.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.313
He told me so the last time
I saw him alive. I was 7.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.437
I'll get it.
I wish Uncle Joe had died...

03:13.640 --> 03:17.076
...before I spent 12.95
on this stupid watch.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.230
Hello, Aunt Heather.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.679
We... We missed you at the take.
I mean, at the wake.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.229
We were so sorry
to hear of his passing.

03:34.480 --> 03:39.190
Yes, your grief was evident as
you tried to bite the ring off his finger.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.675
I was kissing his hand.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.677
I loved the man, damn it.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.713
Well, keep your memories then...

03:45.920 --> 03:48.229
...and give me back
everything you jackals looted.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.670
- It all belongs to me.
- Who says?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.189
My lawyer. Fork over the watch.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.796
He wanted me to have this watch.
He probably even said so in his will.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.638
He didn't have a will, so it all
goes to me. Give me the watch.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.832
What, you want this watch?
You think you can get it? Come get it.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.949
Well, come on, lawyer boy.
You want a little piece of this?

04:13.320 --> 04:16.517
Don't push it, Bundy. There's laws
in this town against stealing.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.757
Not to mention overflowing
a dead man's toilet.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.759
Thank you.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.997
And you should all
be ashamed of yourselves.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.191
All I have left of poor Joe.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.392
Come on, babe,
the hock shops close at 6.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.830
We'll send the police
for the rest of this stuff.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.589
- We got a plane to catch to Bimini.
- Toodles.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.597
God, your relatives are scum.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.070
He really did want me
to have that watch.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.874
What idiot would be so thoughtless
as to not leave a will?

04:54.080 --> 04:57.516
- Do you have a will, Daddy?
- Well, no, but...

04:57.720 --> 05:01.793
...I will have one after today. I don't
want this to happen to me if I die.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.639
I shall gather all of my belongings.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.070
I've worked for 25 years.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.316
I've lived and I've loved.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.556
Later on, I even married.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.712
All that is mine
shall be divided among you.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.478
I have nothing.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.836
Now, come on, Dad.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.079
I wouldn't call a 45
of "Under the Boardwalk"...

05:30.280 --> 05:34.034
...and a baseball card of Joe Nuxhall
nothing.

05:34.280 --> 05:39.752
Yeah, and a copy of
Sports Hijinks on beta.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.271
Peg, how could this possibly be?

05:43.480 --> 05:45.835
I've worked for 25 years.
I've amassed nothing.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.276
Oh, honey, it's not your fault.

05:48.480 --> 05:52.029
You could've been rich.
You just never had the break.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.198
Or the brains or the skill...

05:55.400 --> 06:00.793
...or the initiative or even
the mindless charm some get by on.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.230
Feel better, snookums?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.436
Kids, give Daddy a kiss.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.630
He's not dead yet.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.272
Well, he's close enough for me.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.158
I'm still going to write a will.
Now, get me a pencil and paper.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.875
I wanna list all
my worldly possessions.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.318
I said, all my worldly possessions.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.993
Peg, don't you understand
this is important to me?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.350
How would you remember me
if I died tomorrow?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.268
- As a lover.
- A father.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.516
A provider.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.877
Come on, Daddy,
why aren't you joining in?

06:48.080 --> 06:50.514
Well, because
you're making fun of me.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.750
Come on, kids, let's leave
your daddy alone to write his will.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.713
Gee, I hope I get his toilet seat.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.510
Don't be greedy, Bud.
You're already getting his hairline.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.317
See, now we're laughing at Bud.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.992
Why am I making out a will?
Buck, I'm leaving everything to you.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.549
Aruba, here I come.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.076
Hi, Al. I heard your uncle died.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.111
You wanna go out for a drink
or anything?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.629
Yeah, later, after you've left.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.273
Let me ask you something.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.552
What would you have to leave
if you died tomorrow?

07:32.760 --> 07:34.876
A good-Iooking corpse.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.710
I'm sorry, Al, I didn't mean
to rub your face in it.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.631
- What are you doing?
- I'm making out a will.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.274
I have lots of material possessions.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.756
Hey, Joe Nuxhall. We used
to make little boats out of these...

07:48.960 --> 07:52.794
...and sail them into the sewer.
- Hey, now!

07:53.000 --> 07:58.154
I, unlike you,
have provided for my future.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.113
I was just thinking, you know,
something else to leave behind.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.594
You know, something that...

08:04.800 --> 08:07.109
Something that identifies Al Bundy,
the man.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.392
- You've got plenty.
- I know that.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.035
Could you give me an example?

08:14.440 --> 08:17.557
Well, you got all those gold teeth.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.113
And you were a football star
in high school, weren't you?

08:25.320 --> 08:28.392
I mean, I wish my kids could grow up
saying I was a football star.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.308
Well, they will,
because obviously I'll lie to them...

08:32.720 --> 08:34.995
...but it would be nice to have
mementos like you.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.111
- That's it!
- What?

08:37.320 --> 08:40.551
My mistake was I was looking
at my life in the present.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.797
I should have been looking
at my life pre-Peg.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.752
My football mementos. That's what
says Al Bundy was really here.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.679
- Yeah!
- I'll give Peg my old football jersey.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.394
Good old number 33.
It'll be good for her...

08:53.600 --> 08:56.592
...because that's how old she can
tell her next husband she is.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.512
And then I can give my old MVP trophy
to Kelly to go along with hers.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.996
Although... Although,
for the life of me, I can't figure out...

09:05.200 --> 09:08.510
...how she got a football trophy
having never played the game.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.396
And then there's Bud.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.871
Can you loan me a nickel?

09:16.920 --> 09:20.833
I won't lend it to you,
but I'll trade you even for your Dodge.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.475
Come on, Al.
Surely you've got something else...

09:24.680 --> 09:27.148
...from your football days
to leave to your son.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.628
I do.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.592
I do.

09:32.960 --> 09:37.112
My game ball from the greatest day
in anyone's lifetime.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.039
The day that I scored
four touchdowns.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.511
Yeah. My game ball.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.878
That is what I shall leave
to my only son...

09:57.080 --> 10:00.152
...the carrier of the Bundy seed
and name.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.395
And from the looks of things,
the last.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.919
He shall get the most special thing
I ever had in my life.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.958
It's perfect. Where is it?

10:10.200 --> 10:13.670
I gave it to some cheerleader
I was Bundyfying at the time.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.075
So I'll get it back from her.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.078
We had something very special
between us, me and...

10:23.280 --> 10:25.111
...whatever her name was.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.153
Peg? Peg, let me ask you a question.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.517
You remember the name of the
cute cheerleader I was crazy about...

10:31.720 --> 10:33.915
...before I got drunk
and woke up married to you?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.028
Why, yes, I do.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.676
In fact, I remember this rhyme that
everyone used to say about her:

10:39.880 --> 10:42.553
If you wanna get drunk
Get some brandy.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.275
If you want a social disease
Just call Sandy.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.710
Sandy... Sandy Jorgenson.
Thank you, Peg.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.193
Why do you wanna know?

10:56.480 --> 10:59.278
Oh, well... No, Peg,
Jefferson was wondering...

10:59.480 --> 11:02.552
...who my second favourite girl
in high school was.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.836
I wish I could remember
who my first favourite was.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.671
So what if she's unlisted?

11:16.880 --> 11:19.235
This is about a football, damn it!

11:19.560 --> 11:22.518
A man would give me the number.
Hello?

11:25.320 --> 11:27.356
You just spent 25 cents
on a phone call...

11:27.560 --> 11:31.348
...to retrieve a football worth 10 cents
to leave to your son.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.792
Although, I know a pigskin will
forever remind him of his dad.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.712
There's just one thing I wanna know.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.475
Oh, sure, Marcie,
the part with the cups go in front.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.470
Present company excluded,
of course.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.072
You better watch it, Al,
if you want us to keep coming over.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.832
Look, Al.

12:05.360 --> 12:09.876
I hate to interject sanity
into your quest for the holy fail...

12:10.080 --> 12:12.275
...but if you seriously wanna
find this person...

12:12.480 --> 12:14.311
...why don't you call
a detective agency?

12:14.520 --> 12:17.193
There are some that specialize
in finding missing persons.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.278
She's beautiful and resourceful.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.278
Well, I went to one once to find
an old boyfriend.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.596
Six feet, good-Iooking...

12:25.800 --> 12:29.588
...and a perfect 10,
if you know what I mean.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.391
Oh, God, I never had it so good.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.832
The things he made me do.
The things he made me feel.

12:39.040 --> 12:43.238
Everyone since then has just been
an empty shadow in comparison.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.716
Well, not everyone.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.878
My ex-husband, Steve,
was pretty good.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.232
Marcie, you wouldn't happen to have
that detective's number handy?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.677
- Don't be ridiculous, why would she...?
- Sure do. Right here.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.078
Well, don't look at me like that.
It was just a coincidence that I had it.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.875
I have no need of a lost love
when I have you.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.640
I am great, aren't I?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.158
Sure.

13:15.800 --> 13:20.396
What do you mean, "sure"? Just last
night, you called me Captain Kaboom.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.113
Would you have preferred
Private Noodle?

13:29.320 --> 13:33.552
Hey. Hey, Al's gonna think
you're serious.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.391
It's just a little code we have.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.388
It means there's a party in her pants
and I'm the guest of honour.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.879
Oh, yeah, hello. Yes.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.959
I'm looking for a girl I gave a football
to that I scored four touchdowns with.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.834
Yes, I'm Al Bundy.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.838
Polk High, yes. Yes, I was number 33.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.879
Yes, I do have a problem
with foot odour.

14:14.960 --> 14:19.158
Peg, get off the extension.
I'm trying to make a call out here!

14:43.080 --> 14:44.911
Come in.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.838
Sandy?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.957
Hiya, Al.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.270
Sandy?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.391
Do you like what you see?

15:02.640 --> 15:06.553
Well, I don't know, I haven't been
able to take it all in yet.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.997
You know something, Al...

15:16.200 --> 15:19.078
...I think you look even better now
than you did in high school.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.430
Incredible, isn't it?

15:21.680 --> 15:25.753
So, Touchdown, what have you been
doing with yourself since high school?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.678
I mean, the last time I saw you...

15:27.880 --> 15:30.474
...you were taking a summer job
as a shoe-store man.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.032
Yeah, you said you wanted to buy
some new carburettors for your car.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.276
What ever happened
to that old Dodge of yours?

15:42.520 --> 15:47.310
Let's not talk about the past, okay?
I'm a live-for-today kind of guy.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.873
Oh, you mean...

15:49.080 --> 15:51.355
...we can't talk about
your old football days?

15:51.560 --> 15:55.075
Well, I mean,
if that makes you feel better.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.197
Watching you in motion back then
always made me feel better.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.598
So, Touchdown, are you
just as good as you always were?

16:04.840 --> 16:07.673
Well, I haven't gotten any complaints,
if you know what I mean.

16:09.360 --> 16:14.514
- Show it to me, Al! Let me see it!
- Well, it isn't quite what it was.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.316
- I'll be the judge of that. Let me see it!
- Well, I can't see any harm.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.958
You still got it, Touchdown!

16:35.160 --> 16:37.628
Yeah, well, where's it gonna go,
you know?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.192
Al...

16:46.520 --> 16:48.670
...I know why you're here.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.311
Now, Sandy, before you go any further,
I'd like to say something:

16:54.520 --> 16:56.795
You're hurting me.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.551
No, I'm not kidding. You're hurting me.
Take your leg off or I'll sock you one.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.557
Oh, Al.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.758
Hey, did you ever regret
breaking up with me...

17:06.960 --> 17:09.554
...right before
the homecoming dance?

17:10.880 --> 17:15.192
- You know what I want, Al.
- Well, what, a huge McNugget?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.278
- I want that dance you owe me.
- Oh, now, Sandy...

17:22.480 --> 17:26.029
...you know I never danced unless
it was gonna get some sex for me.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.314
Oh, that didn't open
an ugly door, did it?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.957
Oh, come on, Al.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.358
At least promise me a dance
if our song comes on.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.436
You remember "Blue Velvet."

17:46.680 --> 17:49.717
Well, okay, but only
if that song comes on.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.709
That's a good one, God.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.354
All right. There, that's...

18:25.920 --> 18:29.435
Now, wasn't that nice, Al?

18:31.480 --> 18:34.392
Let's... Let's sit back over here.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.798
- Just like old times, huh, Al?
- Oh, man.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.191
Oh, Al, no more dance-y?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.188
No more spine-y.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.237
Oh, my poor Touchdown.
Would him like a back rub?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.908
Well, you know, Sandy,
what I'd really like...

19:40.600 --> 19:44.434
You know, Sandy, this might be
a good time to ask you something.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.551
What is it, Al?

19:47.120 --> 19:49.429
What do you want?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.995
My football.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.916
Your football?
You mean, the game ball?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.917
Gee, Al...

20:00.200 --> 20:04.398
...giving me that ball was
what let me know I was special to you.

20:04.640 --> 20:08.792
Yeah, I know, so could I have it back?
I wanna give it to somebody else.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.793
Well, well. And here I thought...

20:13.000 --> 20:15.833
...the guy who dumped me
20 years ago was crawling back.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.789
I should have known.
All he wanted was his football.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.754
Well, all right, Al.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.679
I'll give it back to you...

20:27.720 --> 20:29.392
...on one condition.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.956
Oh, all right.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.840
No, no, the moment has passed.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.308
I was just...

20:40.520 --> 20:42.829
I guess I was just
kind of remembering...

20:43.040 --> 20:46.476
...how you and I used to play catch
with it at the park.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.268
Could I at least throw you
one last pass...

20:49.480 --> 20:51.516
...just to remember
the good times by?

20:51.760 --> 20:54.035
Sure, if it'll help take the edge off,
you know...

20:54.240 --> 20:57.835
...watching the big guy walk out
of your life for the second time.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.508
Can you still lay it in there
anywhere you want to?

21:00.760 --> 21:04.639
I sure can. Can you still catch it
anywhere I lay it?

21:04.880 --> 21:06.438
I sure can.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.955
All right then. Go long.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.669
Yes, son, this ball means
everything to me.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.118
Not that you and what's-her-name
and what's-her-name...

21:27.320 --> 21:29.436
...haven't brought me great joy.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.117
But I'm glad
we're talking here alone, son.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.072
I don't want the others to be jealous.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.552
Well, there's no need
to whisper, Dad.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.558
They heard you were coming home
from the hospital today...

21:42.760 --> 21:44.398
...so they went to a movie.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.673
That's good. That's good, son...

21:50.880 --> 21:53.599
...because we can have
this private moment together.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.712
I went through hell to get this ball,
but it was worth it.

21:56.920 --> 22:02.199
Because now I'm going to leave you,
my only begotten son...

22:02.760 --> 22:06.036
...my Joe Nuxhall baseball card.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.315
Well, what about your football?

22:10.760 --> 22:13.069
My football? Are you insane?

22:13.960 --> 22:16.349
I'm going to leave this
to the only one I truly love:

22:16.560 --> 22:18.039
Me.

22:18.640 --> 22:22.838
No, Bud, I'm going to be buried
with all my football stuff.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.874
So, what do we get?
