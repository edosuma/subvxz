embedded by consolidating

08:36.243 --> 08:39.661
into neural networks,
clogging existing pathways

08:39.744 --> 08:42.619
and threatening higher

08:42.702 --> 08:47.661
We call this process
"recollective infestation."

08:47.744 --> 08:50.661

is to call a good exterminator,

Nostalgia from the cortex.

13:19.952 --> 13:21.619
What is it, Petey?

13:22.077 --> 13:24.160
Remember when you
told me to drive over

13:24.243 --> 13:26.285
to Detective Tillman's
house because you--

13:26.369 --> 13:28.786
or, you know, Looking Glass,
because you thought

13:28.869 --> 13:31.702
it was really unusual that
he ratted out Detective Abar,

13:31.786 --> 13:35.160
and you were worried
that maybe he was working
with the 7th Kavalry?

13:35.243 --> 13:36.869
Yes, Petey.
I remember it

13:36.952 --> 13:39.619
as if I said all of that
to you verbatim.

13:39.702 --> 13:40.952
Anyway,

13:41.035 --> 13:44.952
I'm pretty sure he's not working
with them because, uh...

13:45.702 --> 13:49.035
five of them are here,
and they're extremely dead.

13:51.035 --> 13:52.410
Are you sure they're Kavalry?

13:52.494 --> 13:55.118
Yeah. Yeah, they're all
wearing Rorschach masks.

13:55.911 --> 13:59.118
Well, actually, hold on,
one of them isn't.

13:59.452 --> 14:01.661
Mirror Guy, where is he?

14:01.744 --> 14:02.911
Not here.

14:04.077 --> 14:09.077
Kind of strange considering
he's a cop, that he didn't
call this in, huh?

14:10.577 --> 14:12.494
Should I call this in?

14:12.577 --> 14:15.035
Blake: Uh, uh...
No, you should not call it in.

14:15.118 --> 14:16.535
You should stay
exactly where you are.

14:16.619 --> 14:18.952
I'll be there as soon as
I'm done with my thing here.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.619
What thing?

14:23.410 --> 14:24.494
Agent Blake?

14:24.577 --> 14:26.786
(static crackling):
Hello?

14:36.619 --> 14:37.993
Agent Blake.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.993
Mrs. Crawford.

14:40.410 --> 14:41.535
Howdy.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.035
Jane:
May I get you some tea?

14:44.118 --> 14:46.993
-Blake: Oh thanks,
no, I'm fine.
-You sure?

14:47.077 --> 14:48.410
Please,
have a seat.

14:48.494 --> 14:50.993
-I can make some coffee--
-Mrs. Crawford,

14:51.619 --> 14:53.619
I know who killed your husband.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.452
What?

14:56.452 --> 14:58.702
His name is Will Reeves.

14:58.786 --> 15:02.202
He was a policeman
in New York, back in the 1940s,

15:02.285 --> 15:04.702
and he has history
here in Tulsa.

15:04.786 --> 15:07.952
He's Angela Abar's
grandfather.

15:08.786 --> 15:11.202
I-I don't understand.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.786
Angela said
she doesn't have any family.

15:13.869 --> 15:17.118
Well, we all have family,
Mrs. Crawford.

15:17.202 --> 15:20.035
Some of them we just...
don't talk about.

15:20.118 --> 15:23.369
Well, why would this
man want to kill Judd?

15:24.118 --> 15:26.827
Well, this is the part
that gets weird.

15:27.577 --> 15:31.577
Angela OD'd
on her grandpa's Nostalgia,

15:31.661 --> 15:34.952
and while she was under,
she talked, a lot.

15:35.952 --> 15:39.035
It's as if she was channeling
the old man, reliving his life.

15:39.118 --> 15:42.993
I've got it all on tape
if you want to listen.

15:43.327 --> 15:45.494
Like I said, weird.

15:46.035 --> 15:48.494
It turns out that...

15:49.202 --> 15:51.952
Will Reeves was
Hooded Justice...

15:53.160 --> 15:55.869
the very first
masked vigilante.

15:57.327 --> 15:59.243
And he was black.

16:00.035 --> 16:01.619
I mean, this is
a guy who inspired

16:01.702 --> 16:05.035
two generations of heroes,
my folks and myself included,

16:05.494 --> 16:07.661
but he had to hide
who he was.

16:07.744 --> 16:10.285
Because white men
in masks are heroes,

16:10.369 --> 16:12.535
but black men in masks...

16:13.327 --> 16:15.160
are scary.

16:15.911 --> 16:17.993
Thank God times
have changed.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.661
Yeah, thank God.

16:20.744 --> 16:22.243
But the point is,

16:22.327 --> 16:25.243
when she was walking a mile
in Grandpa's memories,

16:25.327 --> 16:28.077
Angela kept saying one word
over and over and over:

16:28.702 --> 16:30.535
Cyclops.

16:31.494 --> 16:33.410
Am I supposed
to know what that is?

16:33.494 --> 16:37.577
Back in the day,
it was a racist cult,
hot for mind control.

16:37.661 --> 16:39.619
-Reeves--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mind control?

16:39.702 --> 16:40.993
Yes, I know. I know.

16:41.077 --> 16:43.661
Now, this may come
as a bit of a shock,

16:43.744 --> 16:46.410
but I think that Reeves
believed your husband

16:46.494 --> 16:49.243
was a part
of this whole Cyclops thing,

16:49.327 --> 16:52.243
and that's why he killed him.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.494
And what do you believe?

16:56.285 --> 17:00.827
Well, I-I wouldn't be doing
my job if I didn't at least

17:00.911 --> 17:03.827
entertain the idea that
the chief of police of Tulsa

17:03.911 --> 17:06.410
wasn't a secret
white supremacist.

17:07.786 --> 17:12.285
Which has to make
you wonder about his friends,

17:12.786 --> 17:14.952
like Joe Keene.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.452
What if the 7th Kavalry is
just Cyclops by another name?

17:20.619 --> 17:25.327
And what if Senator Joe used
them to kill a bunch of police

17:25.410 --> 17:27.535
so that he could put
all the cops in masks,

17:27.619 --> 17:31.118
and pretty soon, no one can tell
the good guys from the bad guys,

17:31.202 --> 17:33.494
because everybody's
covering their fucking faces

17:33.577 --> 17:37.202
and pledging loyalty
to their newly elected leader,

17:37.285 --> 17:40.494
President Joe?

17:42.494 --> 17:46.243
Well, that was
the original idea,

17:46.327 --> 17:49.202
but something
extraordinary happened,

17:49.285 --> 17:51.243
and suddenly,

17:51.327 --> 17:55.118
president seemed
a bit small potatoes.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.118
-What?
-I'm sorry.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.452
Was I not supposed
to confess yet?

18:01.535 --> 18:03.577
You've just been going
on and on and on.

18:03.661 --> 18:04.869
(clicks)

18:06.827 --> 18:08.202
(clicks)

18:08.285 --> 18:09.369
Shit!

18:09.452 --> 18:11.577
-What the fuck
are you doing?
-(clicks)

18:11.661 --> 18:13.619
-(clatters)
-(gasps)

18:14.160 --> 18:16.327
(clattering)

18:26.827 --> 18:28.494
Hey, it's me.

18:30.535 --> 18:33.577
Laurie Blake just stopped by.
You want me to kill her or what?

18:33.661 --> 18:35.661
(clock chiming)

18:35.744 --> 18:37.911
Woman (over PA):
Good afternoon.
It is now nine hours

18:37.993 --> 18:40.410
until the Millennium Clock
is activated.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.661
All personnel
designated green,
please report

18:42.744 --> 18:46.202
to the medical wing
for removal of any
remaining metal implants.

18:46.786 --> 18:48.410
(clock chimes)

18:48.494 --> 18:51.369
(rattling)

19:11.369 --> 19:13.494
Which man looks
more trustworthy?

19:14.327 --> 19:15.869
-What?
-First instinct.

19:15.952 --> 19:18.494
Which is more trustworthy?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.827
The candy man.

19:22.911 --> 19:23.993
Why?

19:24.077 --> 19:26.077
People don't fly kites alone.

19:36.577 --> 19:39.243
Which woman looks more scared?

19:41.952 --> 19:43.661
The one who's about to jump.

19:43.744 --> 19:46.410
What makes you think
she's going to jump?

19:46.494 --> 19:49.035
Why would else
would she be on a ledge?

19:54.077 --> 19:56.243
Which woman is
the angriest?

20:03.827 --> 20:06.077
They're exactly the same.

20:10.619 --> 20:12.160
Are you sure?

20:14.118 --> 20:17.952
I'm sorry, but what does this
have to do with my treatment?

20:18.410 --> 20:20.661
Oh, nothing.

20:20.993 --> 20:23.869
It's, uh, research
for my dissertation.

20:23.952 --> 20:25.869
It's on the adaptive
function of empathy,

20:25.952 --> 20:27.535
and the role of
rage suppression

20:27.619 --> 20:30.035
in social cohesion.

20:30.118 --> 20:32.452
I have a son
that's about your age,

20:32.535 --> 20:35.285
and I can barely
get him to open a book.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.452
Is it hard lying to him?

20:40.118 --> 20:43.869
-What?
-About being
a police detective.

20:43.952 --> 20:47.327
My understanding is you're not
allowed to tell your children.

20:47.827 --> 20:50.369
It's for their
own protection.

20:51.577 --> 20:53.202
Not yours?

20:54.202 --> 20:55.702
They lost their parents.

20:55.786 --> 20:58.744
If they knew what I did,
they would worry.

20:59.410 --> 21:02.702
If you don't want your
kids to worry you're a cop,

21:03.702 --> 21:06.369
then why are you a cop?

21:12.202 --> 21:13.661
Detective Abar?

21:14.035 --> 21:15.661
Detective Abar?

21:16.202 --> 21:17.661
Are you okay?

21:40.952 --> 21:42.160
(speaks Vietnamese)

21:48.202 --> 21:52.369
(conversing indistinctly)

21:54.160 --> 21:55.869
(speaks Vietnamese)

22:11.744 --> 22:14.786
-Okay.
-(speaks Vietnamese)

22:18.077 --> 22:19.243
(bicycle bell rings)

22:25.202 --> 22:26.702
(bicycle bell rings)

22:40.410 --> 22:42.702
I'm not scared.

22:42.786 --> 22:45.243
That's him.

22:45.911 --> 22:47.285
(Jen speaks Vietnamese)

22:48.661 --> 22:50.243
I'm sure.

23:06.535 --> 23:09.118
(speaks Vietnamese)

23:11.619 --> 23:13.077
Can I listen?

23:21.452 --> 23:23.243
(speaks Vietnamese)

23:31.993 --> 23:34.494
(gunshot echoes)

23:37.661 --> 23:38.952
(speaks Vietnamese)

23:53.494 --> 23:56.869
Bian:
If you don't want your
kids to worry you're a cop,

23:58.035 --> 24:00.702
then why are you a cop?

24:03.993 --> 24:07.410
June:
You ain't gonna get justice
with a badge, Will Reeves.

24:07.494 --> 24:09.827
You're gonna get it
with that hood.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.202
Bian:
Detective Abar?

24:16.952 --> 24:18.577
Detective Abar?

24:22.911 --> 24:24.869
Whose was it?

24:25.786 --> 24:27.285
What?

24:27.369 --> 24:29.535
Whose memory did
you just experience?

24:30.035 --> 24:33.035
Yours or your
grandfather's?

24:36.702 --> 24:38.327
Mine.

24:38.993 --> 24:40.702
Well, that's progress.

24:40.786 --> 24:42.993
It means the treatment
is working.

24:49.535 --> 24:52.702
I have these dreams sometimes.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.410
They feel so real.

24:58.619 --> 25:01.243
I'm an old woman.

25:04.911 --> 25:06.619
I'm scared...

25:08.285 --> 25:10.243
and it hurts.

25:11.285 --> 25:13.661
What was it like
for you...

25:13.744 --> 25:15.911
(silence)

25:19.535 --> 25:25.369
...when you saw what he saw,
felt what he felt?

25:32.369 --> 25:35.077
(sighing):
It hurt too.

25:39.952 --> 25:43.118
(bell clanging)

25:47.035 --> 25:50.243
Philips:
Hear ye! Hear ye!

25:51.452 --> 25:54.786
So begins day 365

25:54.869 --> 25:57.619
of the People
versus Adrian Veidt,

25:57.702 --> 26:00.077
alias Ozymandias,

26:00.160 --> 26:02.535
alias Master.

26:02.619 --> 26:08.410
All rise for His Honor,
the Game Warden!

26:08.494 --> 26:10.577
(chairs scraping)

26:10.661 --> 26:13.077
(footsteps echo)

26:17.952 --> 26:19.494
Be seated.

26:24.993 --> 26:28.077
Very well.
Let's get this over with.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.869
Madame Prosecutor,
you may offer your
closing argument.

26:33.327 --> 26:35.160
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

26:35.243 --> 26:36.952
Honorable Warden,

26:39.202 --> 26:40.535
Master.

26:42.369 --> 26:45.661
From the moment the accused
pulls us from the water

26:46.285 --> 26:50.118
to the moment
he inevitably slaughters us,

26:50.202 --> 26:52.243
we are governed by one law,

26:52.327 --> 26:54.577
a law imbued in us
by our creator

26:54.661 --> 26:56.535
when he gifted us with life

26:56.619 --> 26:59.869
and this glorious paradise
in which to live it.

27:01.869 --> 27:05.202
Thou shalt not leave!

27:06.535 --> 27:08.911
Is the accused guilty of murder?

27:08.993 --> 27:11.327
The evidence is indisputable.

27:11.410 --> 27:13.952
Even from the time
before he came to us,

27:14.035 --> 27:16.869
he freely admits
he not only took the lives

27:16.952 --> 27:20.160
of fellow costumed adventurers,

27:21.077 --> 27:22.744
but those...

27:22.827 --> 27:27.911
of three million
innocent people!

27:30.869 --> 27:33.118
Does he apologize
for manufacturing

27:33.202 --> 27:37.786
an enormous alien being
and using it to perpetrate
mass genocide?

27:37.869 --> 27:41.369
Does he show
a shred of remorse?

27:41.869 --> 27:43.494
No.

27:43.577 --> 27:46.911
He tells us such wanton
carnage was a necessary

27:46.993 --> 27:50.243
sacrifice to achieve utopia.

27:51.285 --> 27:52.577
And so for years,

27:52.661 --> 27:56.035
he hurled our lifeless bodies
into the great beyond.

27:56.702 --> 27:59.619
Lives we offered unto him

27:59.702 --> 28:02.577
without questioning his intent,

28:02.661 --> 28:05.993
an intent he made
evermore clear

28:06.077 --> 28:09.077
in a series of self-
aggrandizing monologues,

28:09.160 --> 28:11.827
espousing his own superiority

28:11.911 --> 28:14.702
and his true purpose.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.243
Escape.

28:19.410 --> 28:23.077
Thou shalt not leave.

28:25.118 --> 28:27.035
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:27.118 --> 28:29.285
the choice is simple.

28:30.410 --> 28:33.911
Resign yourself to our
Master's cruel whim...

28:37.619 --> 28:39.786
or find him...

28:41.577 --> 28:43.285
guilty.

28:58.285 --> 29:00.410
The prosecution rests.

29:04.619 --> 29:06.786
Game Warden:
Master Veidt,

29:06.869 --> 29:10.243
you have chosen to represent
yourself, and, yet,

29:10.327 --> 29:11.577
over the course
of this past year,

29:11.661 --> 29:13.661
you've offered
no testimony nor evidence

29:13.744 --> 29:16.494
to contradict
the prosecution's case.

29:17.952 --> 29:21.285
If you have anything to say
in your defense, say it now.

29:35.577 --> 29:37.202
(clears throat)

29:38.327 --> 29:40.160
(farting loudly)

29:40.243 --> 29:43.077
(gasps, murmuring)

29:43.160 --> 29:44.661
(fart squeaks)

29:48.035 --> 29:49.702
The defense...

29:51.077 --> 29:52.577
rests.

29:53.535 --> 29:56.035
(murmuring)

29:57.202 --> 29:58.535
(bangs)

30:00.535 --> 30:03.452
Ladies and gentlemen,
I owe you an apology.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.327
Not for the foul
disregard for decency

30:06.410 --> 30:09.869
that just emanated
from the bowels of the accused,

30:09.952 --> 30:13.285
but for placing
upon you the burden

30:13.369 --> 30:15.993
of judging him.

30:16.993 --> 30:19.827
For it is the foundation of
a fair trial that every man

30:19.911 --> 30:23.369
be judged by a jury
of his peers.

30:25.369 --> 30:27.410
You are not his peers.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.410
As such, I have taken
the liberty

30:29.494 --> 30:32.285
of assembling
an alternative jury

30:32.369 --> 30:35.577
much more suited
to the task.

30:41.993 --> 30:44.619
-Go!
-(squealing)

30:45.827 --> 30:49.118
(gasps, chattering)

30:55.077 --> 30:57.410
What say you, madam?

30:58.285 --> 31:01.077
-(grunts)
-How do you find
the defendant?

31:04.744 --> 31:08.243
(squealing)

31:08.327 --> 31:10.744
Guilty!

31:11.661 --> 31:13.993
All:
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

31:14.077 --> 31:16.869
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

31:16.952 --> 31:20.869
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

31:20.952 --> 31:23.035
Guilty! Guilty!

31:23.118 --> 31:25.410
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

31:25.494 --> 31:28.202
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

31:28.285 --> 31:31.410
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty...

32:08.661 --> 32:10.786
(whirs, buzzes)

32:13.243 --> 32:14.369
Lady Trieu:
Hey!

32:15.077 --> 32:17.118
You hungry?

32:17.452 --> 32:19.452
Then why'd
you come here?

32:19.535 --> 32:21.911
I have a secret plan
to save humanity,

32:21.993 --> 32:24.452
and it starts in Oklahoma.

32:24.535 --> 32:27.285
Can't tell if
you're kidding.

32:27.827 --> 32:29.786
Sure you can.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.535
Why did you come here?

32:34.993 --> 32:37.285
My husband and I
were tired of Saigon.

32:37.369 --> 32:39.452
Tulsa PD was hiring...

32:39.535 --> 32:40.952
Seemed as good
a place as any.

32:41.035 --> 32:44.243
And you were
looking to start over
after his accident.

32:44.327 --> 32:45.869
It was a car crash,
right?

32:47.661 --> 32:50.118
I've done a lot of
research on memory.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.577
Total amnesia's
extremely rare.

32:52.661 --> 32:54.577
Unless you're in a soap opera.

32:54.661 --> 32:57.118
In real life,
it almost never happens.

32:57.202 --> 32:58.744
It happened.

32:59.369 --> 33:01.494
Of course it did.

33:02.535 --> 33:04.827
I can't imagine
what it was like.

33:04.911 --> 33:07.744
No sense of who he was
or who you were.

33:08.494 --> 33:11.202
His whole life up
to that moment just...

33:12.285 --> 33:13.410
gone.

33:13.494 --> 33:15.661
How do you know about Cal?

33:15.744 --> 33:18.993
-Your grandfather told me.
-I spent all of 20 minutes
with that man.

33:19.077 --> 33:21.118
He doesn't know
shit about my husband.

33:21.202 --> 33:24.535
-Well, he knows
shit about you.
-Yeah?

33:24.619 --> 33:28.160
Let's follow my tube and
see what he knows about me.

33:28.243 --> 33:30.577
It would be a bad idea
to see him right now.

33:30.661 --> 33:33.535
Then why did he want me
to take his fucking pills?

33:33.619 --> 33:36.619
He didn't think you'd take
them all at once.

33:37.410 --> 33:41.369
Nostalgia's more
tolerable in small doses.

33:42.077 --> 33:45.452
And who's Nostalgia is
your daughter tolerating?

33:46.369 --> 33:48.577
(clears throat)
I'm sorry?

33:49.577 --> 33:51.911
She told me about her dreams,

33:51.993 --> 33:54.619
where she's some sick old lady,

33:54.702 --> 33:56.118
and I'm just wondering

33:56.202 --> 33:59.285
whose memories are
you slipping to her?

34:01.118 --> 34:02.993
Her own.

34:03.077 --> 34:04.869
What?

34:04.952 --> 34:07.911
I'm slipping her
own memories to her.

34:07.993 --> 34:09.952
Bian's not my daughter.

34:10.035 --> 34:12.202
She's my mother.

34:13.077 --> 34:16.327
Before she died,
I harvested her memories,
and then I cloned her.

34:16.952 --> 34:19.160
Of course,
she wouldn't be my mother

34:19.243 --> 34:22.077
unless she had my mother's
experiences, so...

34:22.619 --> 34:25.452
over time, I've been
reintegrating her memories

34:25.535 --> 34:28.243
while she sleeps via IV drip.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.869
You're a fucking crazy person.

34:33.952 --> 34:36.661
I'm on the verge
of completing my life's work.

34:36.744 --> 34:39.619
Is it wrong to want my parents
with me when I do?

34:40.160 --> 34:42.327
Your dad's here, too?

34:43.661 --> 34:44.993
He will be.

34:45.077 --> 34:47.744
And your life's work is
turning on your big fancy gizmo

34:47.827 --> 34:49.869
so that you can save humanity?

34:49.952 --> 34:53.327
You make it sound ridiculous
when you say it like that.

34:53.993 --> 34:57.619
So then tell me
what it fucking does,

34:57.702 --> 34:59.285
your clock.

34:59.369 --> 35:00.993
No.

35:01.827 --> 35:05.869
(bell chiming)

35:05.952 --> 35:08.077
Woman (over PA):
Good afternoon.
It is now four hours

35:08.160 --> 35:10.911
until the Millennium Clock
is activated.

35:10.993 --> 35:14.243
All personnel, please report
to the viewing platform.

35:14.327 --> 35:17.535
Lady Trieu's invocation
is for our ears only.

35:17.619 --> 35:20.077
The future thanks
you for your service.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.118
(crackling)

35:22.202 --> 35:24.702
(groaning)

35:26.494 --> 35:28.035
(gasps)

35:54.744 --> 35:56.369
Keene:
Agent Blake.

35:59.993 --> 36:02.827
I hear you
cracked the case.

36:03.410 --> 36:04.993
Hooded Justice?

36:05.077 --> 36:06.993
I didn't see that coming.

36:07.077 --> 36:11.035
Not a lot of 100-year-old
vigilantes rolling around.

36:12.535 --> 36:14.243
A trapdoor?

36:14.911 --> 36:17.285
-I'm sorry?
-Who has a fucking trapdoor

36:17.369 --> 36:19.243
installed in their living room?

36:19.327 --> 36:20.577
Ah.

36:21.118 --> 36:24.993
Jane told me I was tempting fate
by sending you down to Tulsa,

36:25.077 --> 36:28.494
but for reasons that will soon
become obvious, I couldn't--

36:28.577 --> 36:30.202
Oh Jesus, please don't.

36:30.285 --> 36:34.369
-What?
-Talk me through
your fucking plan.

36:34.452 --> 36:36.035
Let me guess.

36:36.118 --> 36:37.827
When you were just a boy,

36:37.911 --> 36:39.702
your father put you
on his knee and told you

36:39.786 --> 36:42.327
that you'd been born
into the Order of the Cyclops,

36:42.410 --> 36:44.160
and that it was
your legacy to grow up

36:44.243 --> 36:47.118
and be the most powerful
racist fuck in the nation.

36:47.202 --> 36:49.786
That's not at all
what happened.

36:52.702 --> 36:54.827
I'm tired, Joe.

36:56.035 --> 36:59.577
I'm tired of all
the... silliness.

37:00.035 --> 37:02.035
You want me
to ask you why

37:02.118 --> 37:05.869
I'm strapped to a chair
in an abandoned J.C. Penney,

37:05.952 --> 37:08.160
or what that
cage is for?

37:08.243 --> 37:09.827
Fine.

37:10.535 --> 37:12.786
Just know that
I don't give a shit.

37:18.452 --> 37:21.327
Oh, you'll give a shit
about this, Laurie.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.494
You of all people.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.327
You're wrong
about Cyclops.

37:28.410 --> 37:30.077
We're not racists.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.035
We're about restoring balance
in those times when our country

37:33.118 --> 37:35.827
forgets the principles
upon which it was founded.

37:36.827 --> 37:39.535
Because the scales
have tipped way too far,

37:40.327 --> 37:42.243
and it is extremely difficult

37:42.327 --> 37:44.911
to be a white man
in America right now.

37:44.993 --> 37:46.494
(scoffs)

37:47.327 --> 37:49.827
So, I'm thinking...

37:51.410 --> 37:54.619
I might try being a blue one.

37:57.285 --> 37:59.744
Lady Trieu:
When I was 15 years old,

37:59.827 --> 38:02.577
I graduated from MIT.

38:02.661 --> 38:06.410
- Four years later,
I bought it.
-(applause)

38:06.494 --> 38:10.577
By 24, I had revolutionized
the fields of medicine,

38:10.661 --> 38:13.035
energy, nanotech,

38:13.118 --> 38:14.452
and at 30,

38:14.535 --> 38:18.118
I designed and launched the
first micro-fusion spacecraft.

38:18.202 --> 38:21.118
(applause)

38:21.202 --> 38:24.786
But there were failures, too.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.786
My greatest was Nostalgia.

38:27.869 --> 38:30.285
I gave people the means
to visit the past

38:30.369 --> 38:32.494
so they could learn from it,

38:32.577 --> 38:34.952
so they could
evolve and transform

38:35.035 --> 38:37.202
and better themselves.

38:38.202 --> 38:42.702
Instead,
they became fixated

38:42.786 --> 38:45.786
on their most painful memories,

38:45.869 --> 38:47.535
choosing to experience

38:47.619 --> 38:50.285
the worst moments
of their lives...

38:50.911 --> 38:54.327
over and over again,

38:54.410 --> 38:56.160
and why?

38:56.243 --> 38:57.744
Because they were afraid.

38:58.786 --> 39:01.118
Afraid that once unburdened

39:01.202 --> 39:04.077
by the trauma of the past,

39:04.160 --> 39:05.993
they would have
no excuse not to move

39:06.077 --> 39:08.243
gloriously into the future.

39:09.619 --> 39:11.327
This Millennium Clock

39:11.410 --> 39:13.952
is a monument to the new.

39:14.035 --> 39:16.786
Countless generations
will gaze upon

39:16.869 --> 39:18.911
our mighty work,

39:18.993 --> 39:21.619
and without despair...

39:21.702 --> 39:23.911
(Lady Trieu continues
indistinctly)

39:26.369 --> 39:28.077
I know you're in there.

39:32.952 --> 39:34.993
I took your pills.

39:35.077 --> 39:37.035
You showed me your life.

39:37.118 --> 39:39.118
Why?

39:40.285 --> 39:42.285
I know why you killed Crawford.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.327
What do you want from me?!

39:47.118 --> 39:48.285
Will!

39:48.369 --> 39:51.619
-(banging)
-Open the fucking door!

40:05.952 --> 40:09.118
(deep, slow breathing)

40:21.160 --> 40:23.327
What the fuck?

40:28.118 --> 40:30.827
(electronic beeping)

40:36.160 --> 40:39.327
(breathing continuing)

40:50.786 --> 40:52.827
Automated Voice:
Subject disconnected.

40:52.911 --> 40:53.993
(gasps)

41:06.577 --> 41:08.827
(scrubbing continues)

41:12.452 --> 41:13.869
(speaks Vietnamese)

41:16.577 --> 41:19.535
This lady yell at you
like that all the time?

41:20.952 --> 41:22.160
Yeah.

41:23.118 --> 41:24.494
You can go now.

41:30.327 --> 41:32.535
Well, hello there, Angela.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.993
I-I'm June.

41:37.993 --> 41:39.744
I'm your grandma.

41:41.494 --> 41:43.077
Hi.

41:43.911 --> 41:46.077
I'm here to take you home.

41:47.285 --> 41:50.452
(indistinct chattering)

41:53.869 --> 41:56.077
Your daddy ever mention me?

41:56.160 --> 41:57.619
Mm-mm.

41:58.494 --> 42:00.410
Figures.

42:00.494 --> 42:02.452
Your his mom?

42:02.535 --> 42:04.702
Yeah, I was his mom.

42:06.243 --> 42:07.827
A ways back,

42:07.911 --> 42:09.827
he told me he wanted
to put on a uniform

42:09.911 --> 42:12.619
and come here
to Vietnam and fight.

42:13.369 --> 42:16.285
I said if he did,
I'd never talk to him again.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.827
He came anyway.

42:19.911 --> 42:22.535
He was stubborn, your daddy,

42:22.619 --> 42:25.661
but he forgot where
he got stubborn from.

42:26.285 --> 42:28.285
The war ended.

42:28.369 --> 42:30.369
He met your mom.

42:30.452 --> 42:34.202
Lots of opportunity
in a brand-new state,

42:34.285 --> 42:35.702
so he stayed.

42:35.786 --> 42:40.118
A couple years went by,
a couple more...

42:41.952 --> 42:43.661
then I had a heart attack.

42:44.993 --> 42:47.535
Mm-mm. I was fine.

42:47.619 --> 42:50.327
It was just a little bitty one.

42:53.118 --> 42:56.869
But such things tend
to have sentimental effects,

42:56.952 --> 42:59.327
so I wrote your
daddy a letter.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.077
Had to send it
to the army here

43:01.160 --> 43:03.327
because I had no address
for him.

43:04.285 --> 43:06.744
It came back unopened,

43:06.827 --> 43:09.744
with a big stamp on it.

43:09.827 --> 43:11.661
"Deceased."

43:12.619 --> 43:15.035
Turns out, he never
listed me as next of kin.

43:15.118 --> 43:17.619
As far as he was
concerned... (scoffs)

43:18.327 --> 43:19.827
I didn't exist.

43:22.327 --> 43:25.619
That's when I found
out he had a wife...

43:26.661 --> 43:28.827
and she was gone also.

43:31.993 --> 43:36.202
And then, they told me
he had a little girl.

43:36.285 --> 43:38.535
A little girl
who was all alone

43:38.619 --> 43:40.911
with no next of kin.

43:40.993 --> 43:44.911
So, I bought me
a plane ticket,

43:44.993 --> 43:47.661
and I came here
to get you.

43:48.202 --> 43:50.869
Tell me something
about yourself, Angela.

43:50.952 --> 43:52.702
Anything.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.118
I'm gonna be
a police officer.

43:59.202 --> 44:00.993
(chuckling)

44:01.077 --> 44:02.702
Of course you are.

44:08.952 --> 44:11.035
What else you got in there?

44:17.577 --> 44:20.535
(laughs) Oh!
I remember this one!

44:21.369 --> 44:24.369
You do not want to fuck
with Sister Night.

44:24.452 --> 44:27.744
-This your favorite?
-I'm not allowed to watch it.

44:28.869 --> 44:30.077
Why not?

44:30.160 --> 44:34.077
My dad said we should be
scared of people in masks.

44:39.827 --> 44:44.535
Well, that's because
someone in a mask scared him

44:44.619 --> 44:46.619
when he was about your age,

44:46.702 --> 44:49.118
and he never
really got over it.

44:50.786 --> 44:52.535
Do I have a grandpa?

44:56.369 --> 44:58.827
Lots of movies
out there, um...

44:58.911 --> 45:00.786
Why you carrying
around this one?

45:01.327 --> 45:03.452
She looks like me?

45:06.035 --> 45:07.410
Know what?

45:07.494 --> 45:09.744
She does look like you.
(chuckles)

45:10.952 --> 45:13.118
I reckon there's
not a lot of...

45:13.202 --> 45:15.619
people here
in Vietnam who do.

45:16.452 --> 45:18.369
No, ma'am.

45:18.452 --> 45:20.369
Tell you what.

45:20.452 --> 45:22.911
I have a VCR in Tulsa.

45:22.993 --> 45:24.869
We'll watch this
first thing.

45:24.952 --> 45:26.702
Where's Tulsa?

45:26.786 --> 45:29.452
Tulsa's in Oklahoma, honey.

45:29.952 --> 45:32.160
It's where we're from.

(chimes)

49:26.202 --> 49:29.369
So many prayers

49:30.911 --> 49:32.452
I own and operate
thousands

49:32.535 --> 49:35.285
of Manhattan booths
around the world.

49:35.952 --> 49:39.285
You wouldn't believe
what people ask him for.

49:39.661 --> 49:43.369
They beg and beg
and beg for his help.

49:44.619 --> 49:46.786
Beg for him to come
down from the heavens

49:46.869 --> 49:48.869
and make things better.

49:49.619 --> 49:52.535
But he ignores them,
every single one.

49:54.202 --> 49:55.535
Do you know why?

49:57.410 --> 49:58.827
I give up.

49:58.911 --> 50:01.619
Because Dr. Manhattan
isn't listening.

50:02.535 --> 50:04.202
He's not even on Mars.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.577
Where is he?

50:07.202 --> 50:09.202
Right here in Tulsa,

50:09.786 --> 50:11.369
pretending to be human.

50:14.035 --> 50:16.786
Are you the one who put that
idea in my grandfather's head?

50:16.869 --> 50:19.577
Actually,
he put it in mine.

50:21.911 --> 50:23.577
Angela...

50:26.035 --> 50:28.744
are we going to keep
fucking around here?

50:29.869 --> 50:32.577
Or are we going to be
honest with each other?

50:33.869 --> 50:35.494
Tell me how you
know my grandfather,

50:35.577 --> 50:37.369
and tell me what the fuck
you're doing here,

50:37.452 --> 50:39.786
and don't say it's
saving fucking humanity.

50:39.869 --> 50:42.661
Your grandfather came to me
because he needed someone

50:42.744 --> 50:44.827
with my resources to help him

50:44.911 --> 50:47.077
stop the 7th Kavalry.

50:47.993 --> 50:50.494
Stop them from doing what?

50:50.577 --> 50:52.577
In less than
an hour,

50:52.661 --> 50:55.077
they're going to capture
Dr. Manhattan,

50:55.160 --> 50:57.702
and they're going
to destroy him.

50:58.118 --> 51:01.619
And then, they're
going to become him.

51:03.619 --> 51:06.535
Can you imagine
that kind of power

51:06.619 --> 51:09.619
in the hands of
white supremacists?

51:10.535 --> 51:12.993
I'm sorry, Angela. I know
you asked me not to say it,

51:13.077 --> 51:16.285
but I am saving
fucking humanity.

51:18.452 --> 51:20.202
I'm leaving now

51:20.285 --> 51:23.118

shit I've ever heard.

51:24.202 --> 51:25.827
Okay.

51:30.869 --> 51:33.619
You didn't ask me
who he is.

51:35.827 --> 51:39.369
-What?
-I know you think
I'm crazy, but...

51:41.327 --> 51:43.702
I just told you
Dr. Manhattan is here,

51:43.786 --> 51:46.911
in Tulsa, walking amongst
us as a human being,

51:46.993 --> 51:49.369

asked me who he is.

I don't want to hurt him.

54:15.869 --> 54:17.535

54:18.077 --> 54:19.452
Okay.

You're a great husband,

what you're talking about--
-You do know.

55:05.494 --> 55:07.993
You just don't remember.

55:08.993 --> 55:11.827
Did we talk about this
before my accident?

55:13.827 --> 55:16.077
There was no accident.

55:17.202 --> 55:18.410
What?

55:18.494 --> 55:20.369
It was a lie.

55:20.869 --> 55:23.577
A lie so that
we could be together.

55:24.786 --> 55:26.702
At least for a while.
