you did at the party.

34:48.168 --> 34:52.257
- You sure you don't wanna stay?
- No. It's okay. We have got plans.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.925
We have girl talk.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.012
- What? Right now, girl talk?
- Yeah.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.097
Thanks for driving. See you later.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.515
- See you.
- Okay.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.521
- Drive safely. Bye.
- Bye, baby.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.647
Bye-bye.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.608
- Text me.
- Okay.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.113
Girl talk.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.534
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.703
I like her.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.834
- [Holly] This is really cute.
- [Ali] That's like wearing a blanket.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.419
[Holly] Yeah, it's so soft.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.212
You can borrow it sometime if you want.

35:31.963 --> 35:32.963
Thanks.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.216
I will then.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.562
This is cute. Where's this from?

35:47.646 --> 35:51.608
Oh. My mom got that for me
for my 16th birthday.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.691
Yeah.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.703
That's a really cute photo.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.246
That was our second date.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.748
We went to the farmer's market,

36:06.831 --> 36:09.250
and they had all those food trucks
lined up,

36:09.334 --> 36:11.586
and we got a sample from each one.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.341
God, Tyler just seems like a great guy.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.802
Yeah, I mean,
he has his moments like any of us,

36:18.885 --> 36:21.012
but generally he's pretty great.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.430
But how is he in bed?

36:23.515 --> 36:27.394
We haven't actually
gotten there yet, so...

36:28.144 --> 36:29.938
Oh...

36:30.939 --> 36:31.981
I'm sorry, I...

36:32.065 --> 36:35.527
No, it's not a big deal. No.
We're just, you know, taking it slow.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.656
That's cool. I really respect that.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.408
Thank you.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.536
You know how guys are anyway
once you've had sex.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.417
[Gil] Bit my lip.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.168
All right, man.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.338
Thanks for the ride.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.219
Yo, Gil, wait. Can we talk?
Like, seriously talk for a second?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.641
Lay it on me.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.939
I slept with Holly.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.778
Do you remember the night
where I dipped out after Melinda's party?

37:18.862 --> 37:20.488
- Yeah.
- I didn't go home that night.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.533
Basically Ali broke up with me
and I went outside,

37:23.616 --> 37:26.619
and I ran into Holly,
and things got out of hand, and...

37:27.579 --> 37:28.621
Dude.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.708
I didn't think it was serious, but just...

37:32.500 --> 37:33.585
It was stupid.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.923
- Well, how was it?
- Oh, no, man. I...

37:40.008 --> 37:41.801
I think Holly's trying to mess with me.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.972
Why would she be hanging out with Alison?
She's gonna tell her about it, I know it.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.641
Yeah, 'cause she's kissing me
to mess with you.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.852
She's hanging out with Alison and Lydia

37:50.935 --> 37:52.812
and taking us all to the Roxy
to mess with you.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.774
That's not what's happening right now.
You gotta listen to me, man.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.444
I don't know.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.698
I don't know what it is,
but something's wrong.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.576
Everyone's weird, man.
That's your guilt talking.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.830
I'm gonna tell Ali about it.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.166
You just fixed things with Ali.
You can't tell Ali.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.876
Why would you give that up?

38:17.754 --> 38:19.422
Yeah, I'm probably gonna head out, man.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.676
- Thanks for the ride, bro. I gotta go.
- Yeah.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.349
- Your door sucks. See you tomorrow.
- See you.

38:42.862 --> 38:46.658
- Tyler won't stop texting me.
- I think it's sweet.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.788
- He's just trying to be a good boyfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

38:55.917 --> 38:59.963
[knocks] It's a little late, isn't it?

39:00.046 --> 39:03.091
- Hi. Mom, this is Holly.
- Hi, Mrs. Hewett.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.760
Thanks so much for having me over.
I really appreciate it.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.886
Hi.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.596
What's up?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.431
Just making sure you don't need anything.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.642
We're good.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.727
- So you're okay?
- Yeah.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.858
She seems upset.

39:20.817 --> 39:25.280
No. She just worries.
I used to be kind of a mess.

39:28.074 --> 39:31.619
- Yeah, I get that.
- Thanks.

41:02.877 --> 41:06.089
What the hell are you doing here?
How do you know where I live?

41:06.798 --> 41:10.343
Don't you wanna invite me inside?
I'd love to say hi to your sister.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.674
Did you steal Ali's sweater?

41:15.223 --> 41:20.353
No, she said she had no problem with me,
you know, sharing things of hers.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.563
[scoffs]

41:22.647 --> 41:24.065
She knows.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.317
What?

41:26.401 --> 41:29.362
I told her everything.
It's okay though, Ty.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.739
- She really likes us together.
- Why would you do that?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.908
- Holly, why would you tell her?
- Come on.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.869
Cuteness, I was kidding.

41:36.953 --> 41:40.248
What, so you're lying?
Holly, did you tell her or not?

41:40.331 --> 41:43.543
Come on, Ty,
do you really think I would do that?

41:43.626 --> 41:46.045
- It's our little secret.
- You're insane.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.549
Ouch.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.584
What else have you lied about?

41:53.469 --> 41:55.096
You're the only one who gets to lie?

41:59.267 --> 42:00.309
This is crazy.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.146
This isn't crazy.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.981
Give it time.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.300
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Viola.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.178
And I wouldn't worry just yet, okay?

42:35.261 --> 42:37.472
We'll be keeping an eye
on her behavior here at school.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.099
You keep an eye on her at home.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.225
Okay?

42:41.309 --> 42:43.269
[Mrs. Viola] Okay, thank you so much.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.155
Hey, Miss Viola.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.575
Sorry. I'm Tyler.
I'm a friend of your stepdaughter's.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.202
Oh, is that right?

42:59.827 --> 43:01.454
Yeah, I didn't wanna interrupt you.

43:01.537 --> 43:04.540
Thought I'd introduce myself
and welcome you to the neighborhood.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.877
- Oh, that's very sweet of you.
- How's she doing, by the way?

43:08.795 --> 43:11.297
The last couple days
she's seemed kind of down.

43:11.380 --> 43:16.344
I know it's hard, moving to a new
neighborhood, new place, new school.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.887
It's not exactly Oakland, is it?

43:18.471 --> 43:20.598
Oakland? We're from San Diego.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.643
Oh, yeah, that's right. Sorry.

43:23.726 --> 43:27.146
But I have been traveling a lot for work
lately, so she's been on her own.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.273
We lost her father recently.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.235
I don't know if she told you that.
It hasn't been easy.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.654
Yeah, I was sorry to hear it.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.031
But she's a good girl.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.242
I believe that. She just gets...

43:40.076 --> 43:42.954
- [sighs] What's the word?
- Obsessed?

43:45.373 --> 43:46.415
Lonely.

43:48.668 --> 43:49.710
I gotta go.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.548
Do me a favor.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.219
Don't tell her that we spoke.
She wouldn't like that.

44:11.399 --> 44:12.441
[Ali] She's cool.

44:12.525 --> 44:15.820
We stayed up all night talking,
and she's actually kind of nice.

44:15.903 --> 44:19.657
It was a little weird, though.
I woke up Sunday, and she was just gone.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.450
Like, no goodbye or anything.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.654
That's what I'm saying.
I have this feeling about her.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.463
- You're sounding like my mom.
- I'm serious.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.748
I looked her up online. Nada.
She's a ghost person.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.512
- You're stalking her?
- It's not stalking.

44:29.542 --> 44:32.128
- Everybody Google searches.
- Okay, listen.

44:32.211 --> 44:35.423
I know she's a little off,
but it's hard to be new here, okay?

44:35.756 --> 44:37.717
- Just give her a chance.
- I don't buy it.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.053
There's something else going on,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

44:45.474 --> 44:48.394
[chattering]

44:54.609 --> 44:55.651
[Ali] Be nice.

44:56.193 --> 44:59.071
- Hey, I got your usuals.
- Thank you.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.281
And here.

45:00.364 --> 45:03.159
Thanks.
What happened to you this weekend?

45:03.242 --> 45:05.411
You know, I woke up
with a stomach flu on Sunday.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.747
Nothing worse than being sick
at someone else's house...

45:07.830 --> 45:10.791
There's nothing worse
than a stomach bug. I swear, it's...

45:10.875 --> 45:12.835
Yeah, it's the worst.
Are you feeling better?

45:12.919 --> 45:15.004
I've been feeling weird
the past few days.

45:15.087 --> 45:19.216
You know what really helps me with that
when I feel nauseous is ginger tea.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.468
With a little lemon.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.263
It just tastes good.

45:25.348 --> 45:28.809
Oh, my God. Holy shit, is she choking?

45:28.893 --> 45:31.229
She's having an allergy attack.
Someone get help.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.941
I have to find her EpiPen.
Someone call for help!

46:06.305 --> 46:08.015
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.744
God.

46:40.840 --> 46:41.966
[phone beeps]

47:11.120 --> 47:13.247
[creaking]

47:56.290 --> 47:57.666
[sighs]

48:00.711 --> 48:03.714
[panting]

48:33.869 --> 48:35.746
Hey, we need to talk.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.207
Oh, my God,
I'm so happy to see you. I...

48:38.290 --> 48:39.917
I didn't get any sleep last night.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.671
Lydia... her doctor said
there was something in that smoothie.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.357
She started coughing up blood
again last night.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.466
- What?
- Yeah, it was...

48:47.550 --> 48:50.261
It was horrible.
There was so much blood and...

48:50.344 --> 48:52.847
- Oh, my God. Hey, baby, come here.
- I don't know.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.977
I'm so lucky I have you.

49:21.667 --> 49:25.671
Corinne, what an unpleasant surprise.
I thought you were in New York.

49:30.176 --> 49:31.302
Try to remember,

49:32.678 --> 49:34.013
I'm on your side here.

49:34.096 --> 49:37.641
It's a little hard to remember that
when Dad left you everything.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.894
You know what's mine is yours, right?

49:40.519 --> 49:41.937
Right.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.523
Providing you put in a little effort.

49:45.774 --> 49:48.277
I know you've been missing
your therapy appointments.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.697
I missed one.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.992
Two. Dr. Gregory called me yesterday.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.410
You were supposed to see him.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.621
And your guidance counselor
is concerned, too.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.540
Are you at least taking your medication?

50:02.625 --> 50:05.211
I told you, I don't like the medication
they put me on.

50:05.294 --> 50:07.379
It numbs me emotionally.

50:07.463 --> 50:09.173
Sometimes that's a good thing.

50:25.814 --> 50:29.109
I'm a very loving person, Corinne.

50:30.819 --> 50:32.696
- I never said...
- And if I...

50:35.950 --> 50:37.409
can't feel love...

50:39.745 --> 50:42.414
well, you see, I'd rather just...

50:46.794 --> 50:47.878
die.

50:50.214 --> 50:53.092
[chuckles] You always forget
the silverware.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.645
Can you please pass me the syrup?

51:22.329 --> 51:24.373
You're so special, Tyler.

51:57.406 --> 51:58.532
[Gil] <i>I don't understand.</i>

51:58.615 --> 52:01.285
Everything was going fine with Holly.
We were hitting it off.

52:01.368 --> 52:02.870
I haven't talked to her in days.

52:02.953 --> 52:06.123
- You think she's avoiding me?
- She's got a past we don't know about.

52:06.206 --> 52:08.250
I don't know,
don't put yourself too far into it.

52:08.334 --> 52:11.211
- Okay. She could have broken her phone.
- Whatever. Who cares?

52:11.295 --> 52:13.589
You know, I'm sure she's fine.
I'm sure she's fine.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.969
Oh, dude, there she is.
Dang, she looks upset.

52:21.221 --> 52:24.058
[bell rings]

52:26.310 --> 52:27.603
What's going on?

52:31.190 --> 52:32.191
Holly's pregnant.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.651
Wha...

52:36.612 --> 52:39.698
Yeah, it's crazy,
but she says she took, like, four tests.

52:39.782 --> 52:43.369
So I don't know,
I guess the guy is a total asshole,

52:43.452 --> 52:46.413
and he actually hit her...
he actually hit her.

52:46.497 --> 52:50.667
I told Holly I'd hang out with her.
She just kind of needs someone right now.

53:32.418 --> 53:33.669
Is that the guy?

53:34.711 --> 53:37.589
I wish. He hasn't been in touch.

53:38.549 --> 53:42.553
Are you serious?
He really needs to be there for you.

53:42.636 --> 53:43.679
I know.

53:49.059 --> 53:51.437
What would you do if it was Tyler's baby?

53:53.856 --> 53:58.110
I mean, like, what would you do if
it was you and it was Tyler's baby?

53:58.193 --> 53:59.194
Would you keep it?

54:01.947 --> 54:03.157
I don't know. Um...

54:05.993 --> 54:07.077
That's a big question.

54:09.163 --> 54:11.498
Yeah, but you guys
are so perfect together.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.542
You're gonna be one of those
high school couples

54:13.625 --> 54:17.504
that gets married after college,
and they have kids, and it's so cute.

54:21.175 --> 54:24.344
I'm sure his parents must love
the thought of you as a daughter-in-law.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.601
Actually, I haven't met them yet.

54:31.977 --> 54:32.977
Really?

54:33.896 --> 54:35.898
- Why not?
- They work all the time.

54:35.981 --> 54:41.069
It's really just him and his sister.
He's very private, so I try not to push.

54:41.153 --> 54:42.154
That's so odd.

54:43.572 --> 54:48.118
- You know that's, like, a little weird.
- I know, but it's fine. It's fine.

54:51.413 --> 54:52.414
Your call.

55:01.048 --> 55:04.843
- [girl chattering]
- [man on radio] <i>Off the glass for two!</i>

55:04.927 --> 55:08.764
[man] <i>Inbound pass to the point guard,</i>
<i>who is surrounded by backcourt pressure.</i>

55:08.847 --> 55:13.227
<i>He comes around two guards
before passing it...</i>

55:13.310 --> 55:15.521
<i>Fakes left and goes right
along the baseline...</i>

55:16.980 --> 55:19.900
[girl] Annabelle.
Annabelle is my best friend...

55:31.912 --> 55:34.748
- [Holly] So, what grade are you in?
- [girl] I'm in third.

55:34.831 --> 55:38.418
[Holly] Third grade?
That must be a nice place to be.

55:38.502 --> 55:39.962
[girl] Mm-hmm.

55:40.045 --> 55:42.089
- [Holly] Wait till you get...
- [girl] Tyler!

55:43.590 --> 55:44.883
Hey, Ty.

55:53.642 --> 55:56.853
- I love your nail polish.
- Thank you.

55:56.937 --> 56:00.148
It's midnight fuchsia.
I'll get you a bottle sometime.

56:00.232 --> 56:03.944
Midnight fuchsia. You're so pretty.

56:04.027 --> 56:07.739
Oh, thank you. I'll tell you a secret.

56:07.823 --> 56:10.033
I always wanted a little sister.

56:10.117 --> 56:14.872
So maybe...
you and I can just hang out, us girls.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.666
Hey, why don't I walk you out?

56:17.749 --> 56:20.711
- No, not yet.
- Yeah, not yet.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.421
Sorry, Tiff, she's got to go.

56:23.964 --> 56:26.091
- Okay.
- It's okay. I'll be back soon.

56:26.174 --> 56:27.301
Give me a hug.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.491
You know, your sister seems real sweet.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.451
I don't know why you never
introduced your girlfriend to her.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.019
You're not my girlfriend.

56:38.395 --> 56:41.106
No, you're right.
I'm not your girlfriend at all.

56:41.189 --> 56:44.026
I'm some whore you knocked up
and then left and tried to ignore.

56:44.109 --> 56:48.322
Honestly, Holly, what do you want from me?
Okay, I'm 17. Look at where I live!

56:48.405 --> 56:50.657
Think I can support you and a kid?
I'm trying to be good,

56:50.741 --> 56:53.368
but we gotta come up with some plan
because this isn't working.

56:53.452 --> 56:56.246
You don't need to support me, baby.
What don't you understand?

56:56.330 --> 56:59.750
As long as we're together, it's perfect.
I know how much you love me,

56:59.833 --> 57:02.669
and I know you just can't see it
because of that bitch!

57:04.171 --> 57:05.255
No, Holly.

57:07.215 --> 57:08.634
You were a mistake.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.266
I know you love...

57:16.350 --> 57:18.018
[Holly grunts]

57:30.197 --> 57:32.115
Just stay away from me.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.285
I mean it, Holly.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.052
- [knock on door]
- [chattering]

57:54.262 --> 57:56.598
[Holly] Can I just, um...

57:56.682 --> 57:57.724
[Ali] Holly?

58:01.561 --> 58:04.648
[Holly] We're still in contact,
and I went over to his house...

58:15.200 --> 58:18.161
- I really didn't know who to call.
- [Ali] No, it's okay. Just sit.

58:18.245 --> 58:22.040
- What's going on? Holly?
- We have a lot to talk about.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.043
I haven't been completely honest
with you.

58:25.127 --> 58:26.127
Okay.

58:28.130 --> 58:32.676
That guy, we have been in contact,
and I went over to his house,

58:32.759 --> 58:36.596
and we had a fight,
and he pushed me to the ground.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.140
Oh, my God, Holly.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.476
God. And I just...

58:41.560 --> 58:45.647
- We need to tell someone.
- No, no. It's more complicated.

58:46.231 --> 58:48.358
You know what, I just...

58:50.360 --> 58:52.529
I really just need to calm down
for a moment.

58:52.612 --> 58:55.741
Okay. That's fine. It's okay.

58:55.824 --> 58:59.036
Just this guy from the summer, I...

59:01.163 --> 59:03.623
I really just need to tell you the truth.

59:26.897 --> 59:27.939
Hey.

59:30.692 --> 59:31.735
Hey.

59:32.944 --> 59:37.199
I got you some flowers.
I hope you're not allergic to those.

59:37.282 --> 59:38.825
[laughs]

59:38.909 --> 59:42.329
Mm, no. Thank God.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.207
How's the hospital? Hot nurses?

59:45.290 --> 59:46.500
Oh.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.335
- The sponge baths are great.
- Ooh.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.586
Oh, yeah.

59:50.962 --> 59:52.047
What's up with you?

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.515
Did Holly know about your allergy?

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.641
Yeah.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.768
Maybe. I don't know.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:10.148
Does any part of you think
that this wasn't an accident?

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:20.992
Ali and I get the same smoothies
every single day.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:25.080
The one time Holly gets them for us,
I have an allergy attack?

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.210
I gotta tell you something about Holly.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:35.090
Me and Holly, we...

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.511
[scoffs]

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.888
Jesus, Ty.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:46.601
This all makes a little bit
more sense now.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:51.189
- You've got to tell...
- I'm gonna tell Ali. I'm gonna tell her.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.984
All right, this is my mess.
I'm gonna fix this.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.448
Be careful.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.255
[line rings]

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.803
<i>Hi, you've reached Ali.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.470
Ali, I got to tell you something.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.226
I slept with Holly.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:11.019
I know.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.481
She showed me pictures.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.361
Yeah. Pictures of you sleeping.

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.530
Pictures of you guys up
in some big house together.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.366
Pictures of her with your family.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.286
You let me be friends with her
this whole time.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.957
Do you even know how that makes me feel?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.418
No, Ali, that's not how it was, okay?
We were broken up.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.545
She told me you were gonna break up
with me.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:38.713
You know that's not true.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.216
I don't know that's not true,
because you lied, Tyler!

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:46.137
You looked me in the eyes,
and you said "No more secrets."

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.225
Please just...

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.061
Don't ever talk to me again.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.266
[phone chimes]

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.873
You're gonna wish
you texted me back last night.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.754
[woman] I need to see Tyler Hansen.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.507
Tyler Hansen, come with me.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.471
And bring your things.

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.361
What's going on?

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.090
I'm gonna have to ask you
to clear out your locker

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.490
and leave the school immediately.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.743
What, am I in trouble?

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.454
Tyler, you're being suspended
indefinitely.

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.124
One of our students has accused you
of assault.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.292
A police report has been filed.

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.838
Elizabeth Viola claims you assaulted her.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.424
I can assure you
this is no laughing matter.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.969
- Who?
- Elizabeth Holly Viola.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:35.765
I know this doesn't sound like you,
but I have to take these things seriously.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.352
Unbelievable.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:52.782
"Elizabeth...

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.993
Viola."

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.981
[Ali laughs]

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.066
[Ali] Have fun.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:10.485
- [man] Okay, be safe. We love you.
- [Ali] Bye.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.744
[door closes]

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.658
[sighs]

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.627
[phone rings]

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.261
[Ali] Hello.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:21.014
[Holly] <i>I know you probably</i>
<i>don't wanna hear from me.</i>

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:25.768
Holly, I'm not sure I can do this.
I don't even know where to start.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.770
<i>I know,
it kills me that he let this happen.</i>

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:30.982
<i>Are you okay, babe?</i>

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.234
No, no, not really.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:38.197
<i>I know how much it hurts
when you lose something so special.</i>

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.573
Yeah.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:40.783
<i>I want you to know...</i>

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.578
[inside house] I'm here for you.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.961
[door closes]

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.246
[glass shatters]

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.319
[Ali screams]

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.228
Gil, listen,
I know you think I'm paranoid,

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:21.426
but I need your help, okay?

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.636
I'm headed to 323 Waverly right now.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.641
I think Holly did something to Alison,
so just call me after you get this, okay?

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.312
[engine starts]

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.065
[tires screech]

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.491
[Ali] Holly, what are you doing?

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.165
Why are you doing this?

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:59.964
Well, I'm using you.
I mean, that is what you people do, right?

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:03.384
- Use each other to get what you want.
- He tried to tell me.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:07.638
Yeah, he did,
so why didn't you just listen to him?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.435
I mean, you believed everything I said.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:14.729
Even the baby.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:20.443
- What does that say about you?
- I thought we were friends.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:25.531
Listen, Holly, if you let me go,
I won't tell anyone.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.701
Okay, we could just forget
it ever happened. It's not too late.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.329
It was too late the moment I met him.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.459
He had my heart, and I had his.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.505
Then ask him... if that's what love is.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.048
It's not manipulation.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.301
Even if it means you have to let him go.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:46.677
You need to let him go.

01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:51.057
I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali,

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.268
because I know he loves me.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.525
No, he doesn't.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.985
[Ali screams]

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:15.998
Oh. Looks like your little boyfriend
arrived earlier than expected.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.298
Tyler.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:27.301
Looks like you're gonna have to see
something you don't wanna see.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:33.975
No.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.018
[ripping sound]

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:43.359
No. Please, don't do this.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.168
[whimpers]

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.342
[cries out]

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.019
[door creaks, closes]

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:29.155
[Ali shouts, muffled]

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.200
[Mrs. Viola] Elizabeth?

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.161
[muffled shouts]

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:37.537
Are you okay?

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.626
Elizabeth, what's going on?

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.763
[Corinne] Oh, my God.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.098
Oh, my God.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.569
[Ali] Behind you.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.653
[groans]

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.699
[Ali screams]

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:38.724
[gun cocks]

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.096
You found me.

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.684
- Sit.
- Holly, what are you doing?

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:24.270
You're gonna have to sit.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.942
Where is Alison?

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.027
No.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:36.323
Now you say, "Where am I?"

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.952
Where am I, Holly?

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.080
See, that wasn't so difficult.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.002
It's pretty crazy, right?

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.397
I've been house-sitting all summer,

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:54.175
and sometimes,
I still can't find my way around.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.428
I can't believe anybody
actually lives here.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:58.888
Me either.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.558
You see, I've been playing this weekend

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:06.437
over and over in my head,

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.732
and now we get to relive it again.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.275
What did you do to her?

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:19.575
I think it's better, just the two of us.
Just like that weekend away.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:25.664
You, me, in bed together.
Nobody else mattered in the whole world.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:30.461
You can't look at these photos
and tell me that they mean nothing to you.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:35.883
- Wow, I love it when you play hard to get.
- Where is Alison?

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.685
Alison!

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:47.937
Ali!

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:01.992
Ali?

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.496
Ali?

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:38.362
Holly, I'm listening to you, okay?
But I need you to tell me what you want.

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:41.574
I want us to be together. You, me.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.660
As long as we're together, I don't care.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.541
- So, what do you think?
- [shouts] Where is she?

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:55.379
Where's Alison? Holly, where is she?

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.471
Ali.

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:15.024
Ali, baby. Please, you gotta wake up.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:21.071
Ali, hey. Hey, it's me. Ali, please.
Ali, please, wake up. Ali, come on.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:23.949
Oh, thank God.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.410
Ali, it's me.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:38.214
- I'm sorry, baby. Come on.
- [grunts]

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.595
- Hold on one second.
- Okay.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.013
It's all right.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:51.727
Come on, let's go.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.466
She killed her.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.479
[Holly] Tyler.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.692
I got something for you.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.630
[Tyler] There's a door in her bedroom.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:45.739
Come on.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:51.370
It's okay.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.416
We're gonna go,
we're gonna get out of here.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.668
- Come on, just a bit further.
- [Holly] Yoo-hoo.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.591
Sweetness,
why don't you drop that for me?

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:06.719
Drop it.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.100
[Tyler] Okay.

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:18.939
[Holly] Now what?

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:24.695
Holly, please just listen to me, okay?
I'm sorry.

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:27.740
For everything.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.867
That night that we shared together
was amazing,

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.703
and that's something
that nobody can take away from us.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:37.124
We were just...
We work, you and me together.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.710
- You're right.
- We're perfect together.

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:41.879
Now put down the gun, Holly.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.005
[Ali] Please.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.593
[Tyler] Put down...

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.428
[Ali gasps]

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.096
Liar.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:55.476
Please, don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.021
Now see, I was even gonna let you live.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.900
Crazy, right?

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:05.361
'Cause it was just so obvious
that Tyler loves me

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:06.570
more than he loves you.

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.908
But then,
you just kept getting in the way.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:14.787
This is my fault, Holly.
Don't take it out on Ali.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.624
I pushed you to this.
This is because of me.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:23.670
I can't keep lying, all right?

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:26.799
You want me to love you,
but I love Alison, and that's the truth.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:34.723
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Which one of you is gonna go?

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.561
- Wait, Holly.
- [Gil] Holly!

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:41.939
[Tyler] Ali, get down!

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.363
[Tyler] <i>It's crazy how one person</i>
<i>can change your life.</i>

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.491
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.827
<i>That's the thing about love.</i>

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.080
<i>At first, everything about it seems
to make sense.</i>

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:01.125
<i>But the deeper you get,
the more you realize</i>

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:02.501
<i>you don't know anything at all.</i>

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.092
<i>Love teaches you.</i>

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:13.429
<i>Love changes you.</i>

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:19.059
<i>Love makes you do things
you never thought you could do.</i>

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.479
<i>It can bring out the best in us.</i>

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.774
[Holly screams]

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:27.651
<i>Or the worst.</i>

01:22:29.736 --> 01:22:31.363
<i>Love can destroy you.</i>

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:42.166
<i>- I was lucky to survive this...</i>
<i>- </i> [siren wailing]

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:43.959
<i>to make it back to reality.</i>

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:47.754
<i>Some people never escape.</i>

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.091
<i>They just can't let go
of their fantasies.</i>

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:54.052
Holly? Holly, can you hear me?

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.181
Look, you're going to be okay.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:22:59.725
All right?

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.144
Don't leave me.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.021
No, I'm not going anywhere.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:05.981
I got you.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:10.986
Promise?

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.449
<i>But I learned my lesson.</i>

01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:20.078
<i>I realized I'd been looking for a fantasy.</i>

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.624
Oh, yeah! There it is, Tiff.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:24.750
Come on.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.086
<i>- But all along...</i>
- Model, girl.

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:30.589
<i>The truth was right in front of me.</i>

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.926
Snap. No place I'd rather be.
