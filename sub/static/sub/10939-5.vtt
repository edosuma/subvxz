WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:03.700
You'reaving
Trouble breathing.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.300
That's a heart-related symptom
Called dyspnea.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.400
I wish you would have
Told me earlier

00:08.500 --> 00:10.200
That you were
Having trouble breathing.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.400
What does this mean?

00:11.500 --> 00:12.800
It means
That your wife's heart

00:12.900 --> 00:14.600
Is a little weaker
Than i'd like it to be.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.300
Is she still getting
A new liver?

00:16.500 --> 00:19.400
Her new lab results
Moves her up on the list.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.800
So...

00:22.900 --> 00:25.300
It's really just
A matter of time now.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.300
I'm making you
A nice sweater, too.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.700
I didn't forget you.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.700
If it looks anything
Like your husband's,

00:35.800 --> 00:38.300
Then i'll wear it proudly.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.400
Listen, there's
This really great jazz club

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
On the south side,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.400
And i've got this friend
That's playing there tonight,

00:46.400 --> 00:48.800
If you maybe wanted
To go out or --

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
What's up?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Nothing...much.

00:52.700 --> 00:53.300
Mary and i
Were just talking

00:53.300 --> 00:55.000
About getting some drinks
On the south side.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.600
Oh, that sounds like fun,
If i'm not intruding.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
No.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.900
Hey.
Hey.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.400
How's miss crawford?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.000
If we don't get a liver
In the next 48 hours,

01:09.100 --> 01:10.500
Her heart's gonna give out.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
Vancouver,
How many times, man?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.300
What?
What did he do?

01:15.600 --> 01:17.400
He's eating my pecan pie.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
Did you label it?
Uh-huh.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.700
Yeah, why don't you put in
The order for miss crawford?

01:22.400 --> 01:25.400
Plan on sticking around, just in
Case you need to assist, okay?

01:27.600 --> 01:31.600
Eric: managing tech support --
Clients get disconnected,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.700
And they just go crazy.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.200
See, i focus on people,

01:35.600 --> 01:38.200
Instead of the technology
That's in front of them.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.000
Half the time they call,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.600
They just need some
Human connection.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.500
I think it's just a pager.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.600
You know, if it's bothering you,
I could put it away.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400
No, no, no.
I don't even see it.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.000
I kind of long for the day

01:53.100 --> 01:55.200
When two people
Can just get together

01:55.200 --> 01:58.000
And communicate
Face-to-face.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.200
It's funny.
Mary talked you up.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.000
Said you were intelligent,
Beautiful.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.900
I thought, "yeah, right."

02:06.900 --> 02:08.900
But then you walked
Through thor.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.400
Well...

02:13.500 --> 02:13.900
Thank you.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.300
Listen, kate,
I've been out here, dating.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.200
I mean, you have no idea.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.200
No one's normal.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.600
But you -- there's something
About you

02:24.800 --> 02:29.800
That makes me want to just cut
Through all the white noise

02:29.900 --> 02:32.600
And ask you if you want
To come back --

02:32.600 --> 02:34.400
Uh...ooh.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.000
Hey, so,
I found the liver --

02:38.000 --> 02:39.500
Perfect match
For helen crawford.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.900
Where?
West virginia,
Hamilton county hospital.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.100
You sending vancouver?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.200
No, helen crawford
Is a nice woman.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.700
I don't want
To take any risks.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.200
Been there before?
Nope.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.300
It's fairly rudimentary.
You better bring equipment.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.800
I'm gonna ride down with kate.
Are you cool with that?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.000
Why wouldn't i be?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.400
Somebody help us!
We need some help!

02:58.500 --> 03:00.300
Somebody!
She collapsed.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.800
She -- she collapsed
In church.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.000
She just collapsed.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.400
Pulse, 129,
B.p., 82 over 48.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.700
Panels are up.
She's diaphoretic.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.300
Rashes and spider angioma
On bilat extremities.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.100
She missed
Her last appointment.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.900
All right,
Let's get her stabilized.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.600
Start her on zosyn,
Empirically.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.500
Shouldn't be happening.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.700
I'm looking at the blood work
From her last exam.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
This should not be happening.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.600
Dr. Grant.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.200 --> 03:37.500
Who did this to her?

03:38.300 --> 03:42.100
<font color="#4096d1">±¾×öä»½ö¹©ñ§ï°½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾</font>

03:44.500 --> 03:46.100
Kate: and all he kept talking
About was technology

03:46.100 --> 03:48.000
And how it was desensitizing
People towards one another.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.300
Yeah, i bet you 10 bucks
You put your pager on the table.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.400
Why would you say that?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.600
Did you?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.000
What does that have to do
With anything?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.600
You sit there, you put
Your pager on the table,

03:58.600 --> 04:00.100
What does that say
To the poor guy?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.300
That i'm on call.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.200
Or that you're
Not interested.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.000
Give him a break.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.100
He was just trying to let you
Know that he likes you.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.000
He basically moved right past
Telling me he liked me.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.600
You forced his hand.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.500
You set the pager there.
You stare into space.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.800
I mean, come on.
He had to pull out the big gun.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.700
You're saying
It's my fault.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.800
Hey, i'm just saying --
I call it like i see it.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.200
West virginia radio.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.500
Yeah, i know.
I'll turn it off.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.000
So, listen, if you don't
Like this guy, why?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.500
I mean, mary told me that
He's great-looking, good job.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.800
I don't know. I don't think
He's really my type.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.300
So, what are you
Looking for?

04:41.000 --> 04:44.800
I don't know
If i'm looking for anyone.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Okay, let's say
You're looking for someone.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.100
Oh, i don't know.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.000
Someone who didn't

04:55.000 --> 04:57.100
At a fancy restaurant
On a night like tonight.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.900
A night like tonight.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.900
A rainy night.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.100
Yeah, you know,
A rainy night.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.700
Okay, all right,
Car accidents.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.700
Car accidents
And dead people.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.000
See?
You get it.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.000
Well, you wouldn't want
Another one of us.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.300
No, i wouldn't want
Another one of you.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.300
But i don't want
A civilian, either.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.000
Ah.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.500
Copy that.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.200
Nate:
Well, as some of you know,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.700
Emily diaz-turner
Has autoimmune hepatitis.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.100
She spent the last three years
On the unos list

05:51.100 --> 05:52.600
Waiting for a new liver.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.400
Now it seems she has taken
Matters into her own hands

05:57.200 --> 05:59.600
And has received
An illegal organ transplant.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.700
Can we still help her?

06:00.700 --> 06:02.200
Well, that's our call,
Ultimately,

06:02.200 --> 06:04.100
But as dr. Newel
Will attest to,

06:04.100 --> 06:06.700
There are 79 current
Liver candidates

06:06.700 --> 06:08.400
In his chronic care department.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.100
It's a question of the acuity
Of our other patients.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.000
It's a question
Of fairness.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.600
Neither dr. Newel nor i
Want to turn her away,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
But we can't create
An unfair playing field

06:18.700 --> 06:20.400
For our other patients,
Either.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.300
Anything else?

06:26.900 --> 06:32.700
Yes, we also need
Your signatures here and here.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.300
Dr. Jonas,
This is mr. And mrs. Grayson.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.900
Dr. Thomas jonas
Will be performing

06:49.900 --> 06:51.600
The recovery surgery today.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.500
This room closed
Or something?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.500
It's for little kids.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.600
I know what it's for.
I've been coming here for years.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.100
I just want to know
If it's closed.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.900
What -- someone
In your family sick?

07:19.900 --> 07:20.800
My mom.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.900
I think she's gonna die.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.000
I've always wondered --
Who's st. Jude, anyway?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.700
Uh...some saint.
I don't know.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.200
There's a statue outside
That sort of explains who he is.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.400
Can i see?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.100
It's not any good.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.100
Come on, let me be
The judge of that.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.400
Wow.
These are intense.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
What?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.100
That's my dad.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.700
Okay.

08:31.100 --> 08:31.600
Thanks.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.900
I'll make sure i put her
Back together exactly like that.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.100
Let's get started.
Scalpel?

08:39.200 --> 08:40.200
Stop.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.200
Stop the procere.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.400
What?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.100
The graysons
Have changed their minds.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.900
Okay.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.200
What do you mean?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.600
I mean the graysons
Have changed their minds.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.800
Hold on. They were fine
When we walked in here.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.600
Why would they just
Change their minds?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.400
Because of me?

09:25.300 --> 09:26.900
Because of me.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.100
Hey.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.200
Hi.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.300
Have you seen my consultation
Notes from emily's last visit?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.800
I can have somebody
Dig them up for you.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.100
Someone must have known

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
That she was planning
To go to mexico.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.100
Why do you think that?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.900
Because i can't find
My notes.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.800
You think someone here took
Your consultation notes?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.800
She needed them
For the surgery.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.400
Tom: oh, come on, kate.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If i could change the color
Of my skin --

10:16.100 --> 10:17.100
Tom.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.800
So, what --

10:24.800 --> 10:28.300
Did they just take one look
At me and pull the forms?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.900
This is --
It's incredible.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.900
Do we have enough time
To get another surgeon?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.500
We can try.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.400
Okay.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.500
We'll keep her
On the respirator

10:58.500 --> 11:02.500
And, uh, get vancouver
Down here.

11:07.300 --> 11:11.100
Well, just go talk to them,
All right?

11:13.600 --> 11:14.900
Don't look at me
Like that.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.900
Just go talk to them,
Please, before they go.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.800
You know, i have
A daughter of my own.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.500
And if anything like this
Were to ever happen to her...

11:57.400 --> 11:59.600
I just can't tell you
How sorry i am.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.700
Thank you.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.600
We know
You've come a long way.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.400
We're sorry to have
Wasted your time.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.200
Mr. And mrs. Grayson,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.600
We can arrange
To bring another surgeon down.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.900
If you'll allow your daughter
To remain on the respirator,

12:21.900 --> 12:23.800
I can stay here with her.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.300
Been a terrible day.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.200
We just want
To take her home now.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.700
Um...
You don't want dr. Jonas

12:34.700 --> 12:36.300
To perform the surgery.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.200
We understand that.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.200
Ma'am...

12:40.200 --> 12:41.800
My daughter...

12:43.800 --> 12:46.600
Was shot
In a convenience store.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.400
We don't know who did it.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.900
But we do know
What kind he was.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.500
All we want

13:06.800 --> 13:10.400
Is to honor your daughter's
Decision to help us save lives.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.200
That's why we drove here
All night.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.600
That's why dr. Jonas
Will remove himself

13:15.600 --> 13:17.900
And i will stay here
For as long as it takes

13:17.900 --> 13:20.500
To get this right
For everyone involved.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Hey.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.200
Dr. Grant.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.700
How did i get here?

13:49.700 --> 13:53.000
You lost consciousness.
Your husband brought you to us.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.400
I thought
I was going to die.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.700
I was sure
I was going to die.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.300
I can still see his face --

14:04.700 --> 14:06.000
Poor...

14:06.500 --> 14:07.800
Young...

14:08.700 --> 14:10.400
So young.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.900
He was just trying
To help his family.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.400
Who?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.400
The young man in mexico.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.500
You met your donor?

14:23.900 --> 14:27.000
After the surgery,
Asked to see him again.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.800
No one would look at me
In the eye.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.500
No one would speak to me.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.100
Later, after the surgery,

14:38.900 --> 14:40.900
I ularm
Whispering

14:41.900 --> 14:44.600
Saying the young man
Was dead.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.600
Simon: uh, dr. Grant?

14:50.700 --> 14:51.500
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.900
I just got a call
From kate.

14:53.900 --> 14:54.600
What is it?

14:55.200 --> 14:56.900
The potential donor
In west virginia --

14:57.200 --> 14:59.300
They won't allow jonas
To recover the organ.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.200
What did he do?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.900
????

15:05.500 --> 15:06.600
Kate asked me to fly down.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.900
I have to ask for permission
To get a helicopter.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.200
Yeah, okay, call lifeflight
And get down there.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.100
What's happening?

15:21.300 --> 15:23.200
Mr. Crawford, i'm afraid
There's been a delay

15:23.200 --> 15:24.700
With the potential
Liver donor.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.700
Why?
We've sent a surgeon down
To perform the recovery.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
I thought you sent someone
Hours ago.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.300
Hang in there.ok

15:32.100 --> 15:33.700
As soon as a liver
Becomes viable,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.500
We'll start to prep her.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.600
I'm sorry.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.900
The tips procedure you performed
On mrs. Turner --

15:56.900 --> 15:58.400
I know you weren't
In favor of it.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
I just treat the patients.
You're the surgeon.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.700
But it did
Buy her some time.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.200
It also brought
Her meld scores down,

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
Which lowered her status
With unos.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.900
Will my wife
Get another liver?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.000
Michael, what you did

16:11.000 --> 16:12.900
Goes against everything
We're trying to do here,

16:12.900 --> 16:14.300
Everything
That we believe in.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.500
Twice before,
Twice in three years,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.600
We've gotten that call
That you had a match for her.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.200
Each time, false alarm.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.600
You should have stayed here
And tried to work with us.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.300
Yeah, we started to believe
That, um...

16:30.800 --> 16:32.600
That was never gonna happen.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.800
It's a hard call.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.600
Yep.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.800
Half these people will die
On our waiting list.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.500
There's just not enough
To go around.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.900
It's not my department,

16:46.900 --> 16:50.600
But i wouldn't penalize
Ms. Turner for what she did.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.100
But it's not my department.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.600
Dr. Grant.
Hank carlson.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.600
Oh, yes, mr. Carlson.
How are you feeling?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.700
Well, my oldest daughter
Finally got pregnant.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.000
That's great news.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.099
Baby girl's due
In january.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.400
Dr.neexplained
My options.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.599
He told me
I could keep waiting

17:14.599 --> 17:17.000
Or talk toou
About some procedure.

17:18.099 --> 17:18.800
Right.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.300
I just want to know --

17:21.300 --> 17:24.000
Am i gonna live
To see my granddaughter?

17:27.300 --> 17:30.400
Why don't you come see me?
We can talk about your options.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.600
Do you understand

17:31.600 --> 17:33.500
What dr. Newel has been
Telling you?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.400
Basically,
It comes down to the fact

17:35.400 --> 17:37.200
That i'm getting worse.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.700
The blockage in the vein

17:38.700 --> 17:40.000
That brings the blood flow
To your liver

17:40.000 --> 17:42.900
Creates an accumulation
Of fluid in the abdomen.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.300
Believe me, i know.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.600
We can place a tube
In the middle of your liver

17:47.600 --> 17:49.400
To re-route
Your blood flow.

17:49.700 --> 17:50.700
But it won't cure me.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.000
No, it only
Buys you time.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.800
But i won't be
On the transplant list

17:56.800 --> 17:58.500
Until i get sick again.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.700
That's the trade.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.700
Ve always made'
My own decisions,

18:12.700 --> 18:15.000
The difficult ones,
All my life --

18:15.300 --> 18:19.300
In the army, with my family,
For my kids.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.500
You strike me as the kind of man
Who understands that.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.500
If you were me --
You had little time to live

18:29.500 --> 18:31.600
And a grandchild
On the way --

18:32.000 --> 18:34.500
Would you trade you a chance
At 10 years

18:34.500 --> 18:36.400
For the certainty
Of six months?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.400
As your doctor, i can only
Present you with the options.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.100
I can't make the decision.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.400
As a man, dr. Grant --
Then telme, as a man --

18:48.500 --> 18:49.800
????

19:00.900 --> 19:02.500
We've decided
Emily diaz-turner

19:02.500 --> 19:04.300
May receive care
From st. Jude's,

19:04.300 --> 19:06.300
But she may not reive
A transplant.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.200
Why's that?

19:07.700 --> 19:09.800
The illegal transplant
Pretty much guarantees

19:09.800 --> 19:11.900
That any procedure
Long-term care

19:11.900 --> 19:12.900
Given by st. Jude's

19:12.900 --> 19:15.700
Will not be covered
By her insurance provider.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.500
15 seconds --

19:18.900 --> 19:19.900
That's how long it took you

19:19.900 --> 19:21.400
To mention
The insurance company.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.100
We've made our decision.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.700
She'll be given care.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.600
She's not
A transplant candidate.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.700
Um, you can look at this
If you want.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.600
It's okay.
I've got stuff to do.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.300
It's of you.
What?

19:46.300 --> 19:47.500
It's you.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.400
That's not really me.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.600
It is.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.500
It's what i see.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.200
This one was a little nicer.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.400
Let me draw it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Nate: hi, sweetheart.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.900
Uh, hi, daddy.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.600
Um, daddy, this is paul.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.800
Do you remember me,
Dr. Grant?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.700
You're emily turner's
Son paul.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.100
Uh, he drew a picture of me.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.800
Oh?
Can i see it?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.000
That's beautiful.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.800
I made one of you
A couple years ago.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.800
I was drawing a lot
Of superheroes back then,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.200
And you said you'd never
Seen yourself in a cape.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.100
Why don't you show him
That other one, paul?

20:55.700 --> 20:57.700
Here it is.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.300
Who is it?

21:01.500 --> 21:03.300
My mom made me draw this
For her,

21:04.100 --> 21:07.000
From her description of the man
Who gave her his liver.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.800
$100 u.s.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.800
All of this for that.

21:45.300 --> 21:50.000
I am told by a man that
I can walk into the hospital

21:50.200 --> 21:54.000
For the short surgery
And go home the next day.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
He give me $100

21:57.500 --> 22:01.400
And tell me i will receive
$3,000 more, u.s.,

22:01.800 --> 22:03.700
After the operation.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.100
My wife and child --

22:07.700 --> 22:11.700
I told them i'm going to work
For the week on the fishing boat

22:12.000 --> 22:14.100
So they would not be afraid.

22:15.300 --> 22:19.100
I gave the $100 to my wife
And tell her,

22:19.300 --> 22:21.500
?????

22:43.700 --> 22:44.700
Morning.

22:44.900 --> 22:45.900
Yeah.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.000
I'll make
Another cup of coffee.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.400
Yep.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.400
I'm sorry.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.700
Heard you guys had
Quite a night last night.

22:58.900 --> 22:59.500
Yeah.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.500
Never once in my career

23:04.500 --> 23:07.100
Have i ever experienced
Anything like that.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.900
Oh, it's just, in some
Of those rural places --

23:09.900 --> 23:13.300
No, i'm not talking
About, uh, west virginia.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.000
I've experienced
Plenty of that.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.800
I'm talking
About the turner woman.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.200
Dr. Jonas?
Yeah?

23:19.200 --> 23:20.500
Mrs. Crawford.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.000
She's crashing.
Get a cart.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.100
Mr. Crawford, i'm gonna
Need you to wait outside.

23:35.100 --> 23:35.600
No, wait.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.100
Mr. Crawford,
I need you outside, please.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.400
No! Please!

23:41.800 --> 23:44.100
Let's start with 2 mikes of epi
And 10 mikes of dopamine, okay?

23:44.100 --> 23:45.400
Let's go.
We need a bag.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.700
We lost three hours
To that.

24:02.000 --> 24:02.700
Yeah.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.300
Three hours.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.200
???

24:58.300 --> 25:01.600
Nurse?

25:03.900 --> 25:05.100
Do you need something?

25:06.300 --> 25:07.900
St. Jude.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.800
He is the patron
Of lost causes.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.100
Children and hospital workers
And, yeah, lost causes.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.400
Can you send me a priest?

25:21.400 --> 25:24.000
Uh, the chaplain will be in
In a couple hours.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.000
Is there a chapel here?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.600
There is.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.900
Mrs. Turner wanted
To come down here.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.200
Mrs. Turner.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.000
The woman who came in
Last night.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.000
Are you a priest?

26:29.100 --> 26:31.400
No, i-i'm a doctor.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.400
Of course you are.

26:37.100 --> 26:40.800
Mary, mrs. Turner needs
To go back to the i.c.u.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.900
Okay.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.700
I heard
About mrs. Crawford.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.200
I don't know what to say.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.400
It just still...

27:05.500 --> 27:07.400
...still amazes me.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.900
Hamilton county coroner.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.600
This the girl?

27:18.200 --> 27:20.800
She was shot
By a black man.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.800
Right.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.800
So, are you gonna use her liver
On the turner woman?

27:30.500 --> 27:31.000
Hard thing to do.

27:31.100 --> 27:34.000
I know,
But it's still our call.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.700
We're gonna make
A lot of people angry.

27:40.300 --> 27:43.800
You know, from what i've
Been through in the last day,

27:45.400 --> 27:48.500
They're already angry,
Nathaniel.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.000
There's ???

28:09.300 --> 28:10.600
Hey! Hey!

28:11.900 --> 28:12.700
What's going on?

28:12.700 --> 28:14.300
????They are just
Following orders.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.600
Whose orders?
Hastings.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.400
He's forbidden the nursing staff
From assisting in the surgery.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.600
I am not your problem right now.
Hastings is.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.800
<i>¿qu?es lo que estamos
A veces?</i>

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
<i>es la segunda.</i>

28:28.800 --> 28:32.000
<i>iuna vez no!
Otra vez, va a pasar otra vez.</i>

28:32.000 --> 28:34.300
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

28:35.900 --> 28:36.700
<i>estoy segura.</i>

28:36.700 --> 28:37.200
<i>iva a pasar otra vez!</i>

28:37.200 --> 28:39.500
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be fine.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.900
I'm not going to have
The surgery, am i?

28:41.900 --> 28:44.900
Yes, you are gonna get
The surgery. I promise you.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.900
Stay here. Keep things going.
I'll be right back.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.800
I'll keep you here.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.600
It's my call, ultimately.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.000
Look, there's
An available liver.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.200
There's a woman
On her deathbed

29:01.200 --> 29:02.500
In desperate need
Of that liver.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.200
We have two surgeons
Who are willing

29:04.200 --> 29:05.800
To perform the surgery
For free.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.200
That's only a fraction
Of the cost.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.500
Oh, the hell with the cost.
We're past that.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.000
You know, we make these rules.
We do our best to live by them.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.000
But the rest of the world

29:15.000 --> 29:16.500
Doesn't just march along
With us.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.000
It doesn't stop china,
Brazil, africa

29:19.000 --> 29:20.400
From doing whatever
The hell they want.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.100
You don't condone
What they do, do you?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.100
No, i don't condone it,

29:23.100 --> 29:25.100
But i don't have time
To theorize.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.500
I have a patient right now
In my i.c.u.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.300
Who is going to die.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.500
I have a liver
That can save her life.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.900
Why this patient?

29:33.900 --> 29:35.200
Why not this patient?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.700
I am tired of dealing
With uncertainties.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.600
Emily turner will die
If we pass on that liver.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.100
That is a fact.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.500
I just want to go
With what i know on this one.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
Be prepared to deal
With the fallout

29:52.500 --> 29:54.600
From the other people
On the list.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.800
There's a kit...

29:59.600 --> 30:02.500
I'm gonna need an aortic conduit
To restore blood flow.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
The pedic artery
Has a traction injury.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.700
Okay. We're gonna have to do
A graft.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.900
We'll use the vessels
From the donor.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.000
Here we go.
Let's retract that.

30:28.900 --> 30:29.700
Doctor?

30:34.700 --> 30:35.200
Ok

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
Thank you.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.400
Just settle it in
A little bit there.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.700
Slide that one back
Just a little bit, please.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.300
How's mrs. Turner doing?

30:56.300 --> 30:57.500
She's well.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.200
How are you?

31:05.900 --> 31:07.600
You've had a long day,
And i want to tell you --

31:07.600 --> 31:09.500
I'm glad mrs. Turner
Is well,

31:09.700 --> 31:11.100
????

31:11.100 --> 31:12.900
??

31:39.500 --> 31:41.400
When you asked
For emily's consult files,

31:41.400 --> 31:42.900
It didn't sit right
With me.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.400
I wasn't wrong
To feel that, right?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.500
You were close with her.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.600
Speaking spanish,

31:49.600 --> 31:51.600
Talking about things
You couldn't understand?

31:53.900 --> 31:55.100
You were close.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.200
I was speaking a different
Language with her,

31:57.200 --> 31:59.100
Not conspiring.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.600
Yeah, come in.
It's open.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.400
I'm really very sorry
About your loss, mr. Crawford.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.800
I hadn't allowed myself, uh,

32:24.700 --> 32:27.300
Feeling hopeful
In a long time.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.800
Years...

32:31.200 --> 32:32.900
Years of waiting.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.500
Life sort of stopped.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.300
We had all these plans.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.900
Even when you told us
That she was next,

32:44.900 --> 32:50.100
Even then i didn't allow myself
To feel hopeful.

32:53.700 --> 32:54.500
But last night,
When you said

32:54.500 --> 32:56.400
That you were going
To get the liver,

32:57.500 --> 32:59.000
Then...

33:00.900 --> 33:06.000
Only then did i allow myself
To breathe

33:06.300 --> 33:09.300
For the first time
In years.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.200
I allowed myself
To believe.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.100
I believed she would live.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.500
She was making this
For you.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.200
???

34:03.800 --> 34:06.700
<i>woman on p.a.: dr. Guerrero.
Dr. Guerrero, please.</i>

34:06.900 --> 34:07.600
Hey.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.400
Hey

34:11.699 --> 34:13.500
Do you want to talk?

34:14.100 --> 34:14.900
I'm fine.

34:17.300 --> 34:17.800
You sure?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.600
Oh, kate, i'm fine.

34:19.900 --> 34:20.699
Come on.

34:20.699 --> 34:22.699
I mean, you know,
Helen crawford --

34:23.500 --> 34:25.400
If things hadn't gone down
The way they went down,

34:25.600 --> 34:27.199
She might still be alive.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.400
But we found the organ.
We saved a life.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.600
That's what matters,
Right?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.199
Damn it.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.300
Vancouver!
Did you eat my pie?

34:41.699 --> 34:43.600
No, no, no, listen, man,
What is it gonna take?

34:43.699 --> 34:45.000
Whoa, hey, i --
No, what is it gonna take...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.400
Dr. Jonas, take it easy.
...for you to respect me?

34:47.600 --> 34:50.699
Listen, when i ask you
Not to touch my food,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.500
I expect you to respect me.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.400
Kate: tom?
What?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.300
This what
You're looking for?

35:08.500 --> 35:09.700
I'm sorry.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.600
I was told kate armstrong
Was up here.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, that's me.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.500
Thank you.

35:25.500 --> 35:30.300
<i>dr. Balesco to ccu.
Kate,i'm cool with you and your pager eric</i>

35:33.700 --> 35:35.400
<i>man on p.a.:

35:37.000 --> 35:39.900
<i>dr. Connory, 4619.</i>

35:43.700 --> 35:45.500
Yeah?
Hey.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.000
Simon wanted
To come talk to you.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.900
I told him
To give it some space.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.100
Are the flowers
From him?

35:59.100 --> 36:00.000
No.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.100
But the pie is.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.500
You know i'm used to dealing
With difficult surgeons.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.900
Snake handler.

36:12.100 --> 36:15.200
Mm-hmm, and i've been bitten
Many times.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.700
Okay, look, i know
That i was out of line...

36:20.800 --> 36:22.400
If that's what you're here
To tell me.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.800
I'm not here
To tell you anything.

36:28.700 --> 36:29.900
Do you mind?

36:32.900 --> 36:34.500
No, go ahead.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.000
It's really good.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.900
Yeah, it's from a bakery
On forbes.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.300
Not your wife?

36:46.800 --> 36:47.600
No.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.600
Not my wife.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.400
You know, kate, i want to get
In touch with that family.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.400
Which family?

37:02.400 --> 37:04.100
The one in west virginia.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.300
I want
To give them a call.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
Oh, tom --

37:07.500 --> 37:09.100
Look, i won't betray

37:09.200 --> 37:10.800
Any confidentiality.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.900
I just --
[ sighs ]

37:13.300 --> 37:16.000
God, you know, i really feel
Like i need to talk to them.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.000
I don't know.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.700
Think about it.

37:29.900 --> 37:32.500
I want that number.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.000
Hank: i want to meet
My grandchild,

37:38.000 --> 37:41.300
But i also want to see
My grandchild grow up.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.700
So, you'd rather not
Have the procedure?

37:45.300 --> 37:46.700
I don't know.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.300
My life is running out.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.800
I come here,
And i'm told to wait,

37:50.800 --> 37:54.800
And i see people just like me
Dying every day.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.800
Now, i know there has to be
This system here,

37:58.800 --> 38:01.300
But some days --
I know. I know.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.200
I lived a life
In the military.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.700
There, you didn't follow
Protocols, people died.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.200
<i>but sometimes, even when
We did follow protocols,</i>

38:10.200 --> 38:11.800
People still died.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.900
And you ask yourself
If there's any right answer

38:16.800 --> 38:18.100
To any of this.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.900
There's only the answer
You choose.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.700
I'm gonna skip your procedure,
Dr. Grant.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.600
I'm gonna keep my place
In line

38:28.600 --> 38:31.500
And hope i see you
On the other side.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.900
I hope so, too, hank.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.200
???

38:42.000 --> 38:43.500
Mrs. Turner's doing well.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.700
Good.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.300
Insurance company
Been notified yet?

38:46.300 --> 38:48.600
??? Actually, i got her
Into a pro bono program.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.800
Cover the long-term costs
Of her medicine.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.500
If you ask me, you did
The right thing for her.

38:53.700 --> 38:54.700
I guess.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.500
The truth is our system
Turns our patients

38:58.500 --> 38:59.900
Into our prisoners.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.100
After a while, it's hard
To be the warden.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.800
It was you, wasn't it?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.800
You're the one
Who encouraged her.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.700
What was she
Supposed to do -- die?

39:19.900 --> 39:21.100
Come on, seriously.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.500
We drove her to this.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.700
One false start
After another.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.300
I mean,
What were her chances?

39:31.200 --> 39:34.000
No, really,
Nathaniel, you tell me.

39:34.300 --> 39:36.000
???

40:02.400 --> 40:03.200
Kate: wow.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.500
Well, he wants to take me
On a date to the movies.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.500
Paul?

40:10.400 --> 40:12.000
Yeah, but i don't know
What to say.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.200
I mean, daddy is his mom's doctor.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.200
You like him?

40:16.700 --> 40:21.700
Well, i mean, he's cute
And talented and -- yes.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.900
Well, i say
Start as friends

40:24.900 --> 40:26.900
And see where it goes
From there.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.200
But no date.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.200
Your father's
His mother's doctor.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.500
Whoa.

40:38.900 --> 40:41.300
Is that the way
People see dad?

40:42.700 --> 40:43.800
Some.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.900
People think of him as, like,
A god or something, though.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.100
Sometimes.

40:55.100 --> 40:58.300
Do people look
At all doctors that way?

41:01.300 --> 41:02.500
Some...

41:03.500 --> 41:05.000
But not all.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.500
Mr. Grayson,
My name is dr. Thomas jonas.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.200
I'm calling from st. Jude's
Transplant hospital

41:13.200 --> 41:14.200
In pittsburgh.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.100
I'm calling about the gift
That your family gave to us.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.600
I wanted to let you know

41:19.600 --> 41:21.800
That i personally transplanted
Your daughter's liver

41:21.800 --> 41:24.800
Into a 39-year-old wife
And mother.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.200
Your daughter's liver was
Healthy -- perfect, in fact.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.100
How you doing?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.300
There are days,
And there are days.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.000
<i>post-gazette --</i>

41:42.100 --> 41:45.400
All the local news are running
With the turner story.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.200
Okay.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.400
We broke a few rules.

41:50.500 --> 41:54.200
We're gonna be scrutinized,
Probably fined.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.400
When's
The press conference?

42:01.600 --> 42:02.700
15 minutes.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.700
What are you gonna say?

42:06.700 --> 42:08.000
That sometimes
You cheat the system

42:08.100 --> 42:10.300
To save yourself
From facing failure.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.600
You're not gonna say that,
Are you?

42:16.100 --> 42:18.700
The procedure was performed
Without complications,

42:19.000 --> 42:20.800
And the recipient
Is in recovery.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.300
She's doing well.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.400
Her family is with her now.

42:27.300 --> 42:30.600
I understand that she was
A victim of a terrible tragedy,

42:30.700 --> 42:32.800
And the pain you must
Have been experiencing today

42:32.800 --> 42:35.600
Is something i can't even begin
To imagine.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.900
Because of your generosity,

42:39.300 --> 42:41.500
Her death
Is in no way meaningless.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.600
I wanted to contact you

42:43.700 --> 42:46.300
And to thank you
For what your family gave.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.800
Yes. A son, a teenager.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.300
There are days,
And there are days.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.400
I just wanted to let you know

43:05.800 --> 43:09.500
That your gift
Has given that family a chance

43:09.500 --> 43:11.400
Bt
For a beautiful life together.

43:12.900 --> 43:15.600
No, we haven't met before.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.200
I'm just one
Of the surgeons up here

43:17.300 --> 43:18.500
That wanted to make sure

43:18.500 --> 43:21.600
That your good deed
Didn't go unmentioned.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.000
That's right.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm just one of the surgeons.
