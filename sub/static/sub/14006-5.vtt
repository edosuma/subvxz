00:01.300 --> 00:02.980
Previously on damages

00:02.990 --> 00:04.700
Ms.Connor,is that your brother?

00:07.340 --> 00:09.440
You really think she killed my brother?

00:09.660 --> 00:11.460
6 MONTHS EARLIER

00:11.470 --> 00:14.990
Arthur frobisher-- he wiped out
our whole retirement account.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.780
The law is on our
side,evidence is on our side,

00:19.790 --> 00:24.290
but if patty hewes gets that girl
in front of a jury,all bets are off.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.250
New witness was in florida the
same weekend as arthur frobisher.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.190
I met a guy down in florida.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.180
Gregory turns o to be our missing link.

00:33.190 --> 00:35.580
Grory malina owned frobher stock?

00:35.590 --> 00:37.010
Keep an eye on her.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.000
If she's going to give us something,she's
going to have to get it from him.

00:40.010 --> 00:42.090
I know who he is,the guy in the limo.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.690
Yeah,this is definitely him.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.520
You claim that you
saw these men together?

00:46.530 --> 00:49.840
Mr.Frobisher was ina limousine that
mr.Richards got into that limousine.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.610
Why are you lying?

00:51.620 --> 00:54.280
I only tried to help your case.

00:54.290 --> 00:56.040
Katie,you perjured yourself.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.230
The threat's gone.She lied under oath.

00:58.610 --> 01:00.360
It's been five years.

01:00.370 --> 01:03.170
Starting today,I want you guys to
leave me alone.Just let me live my life.

01:03.180 --> 01:04.580
What is it,tom?

01:05.239 --> 01:08.300
Following katie connor around?

01:08.310 --> 01:11.280
I'm a lawyer,patty.I miss it.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.940
She treats you like dirt for ten
years,won't share the spotlight,

01:14.950 --> 01:17.180
then she refuses make you a partner.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.610
Martin...

01:18.620 --> 01:20.380
tom shayes.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.230
Make me an offer.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.170
Ellen,please.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.720
Help me to help you.

01:32.730 --> 01:36.460
I mean,tell me what happened.

- Who?

02:10.080 --> 02:12.250
4 MONTHS EARLIER

02:17.740 --> 02:18.990
I'm sick of her shit.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.950
That's right,tomahawk,break
the shackles.Take the power.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.110
Always identify your oppressor by nE.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.240
- So w's shit are you sick of?
- Patty'S.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.590
Say it loud!

02:28.600 --> 02:31.750
Ing sick of patty hewes' shit!

And then she tells me I got to
learn how to fall on my sword.

03:19.150 --> 03:22.650
Bullshit.You gave her every
drop of blood and sweat.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.020
Pro and con 'em for me.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.910
There were more pros.Trust me.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.180
No,come on,seriously,make
a list.This is important.

03:29.190 --> 03:29.950
All right,all right.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.830
If I take the cutler job,I make
more money,become a named partner.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.680
Uh,get equity stake in
the firm,better benefits.

03:37.690 --> 03:39.180
What are the cons?

03:41.780 --> 03:43.560
nothing,tomahawk.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.390
Look,listen,I understand.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.580
Okay,you've been with her ten years.

03:46.590 --> 03:49.690
You want to respect spoken
and unspoken commitments,

03:49.700 --> 03:52.780
but you got to forget that shit,all
right?I can be objective here.

03:52.790 --> 03:56.320
I'm on the outside looking in,and
this bitch is jerking you around.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.450
I know,I know.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.320
Right?Plain and simple.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.390
Plus,she's high on this
new associate,right?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.780
You got to make patty feel the sting.

04:02.790 --> 04:06.920
The only way they ever let me run
european at lehman was by me stepping away.

04:07.390 --> 04:11.110
I thought he said that he was grooming
you for svp right out of b-school?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.320
He said all kinds of stuff.

04:12.330 --> 04:15.740
Tom,listen,with certain
bosses,the pattys of the world,

04:15.750 --> 04:19.370
the only way to earn their respect is to
show them that you don't need them that

04:19.380 --> 04:23.100
you got somethg going on for yourself that's
better than being at their beck and call.

04:23.110 --> 04:27.220
I was gone one qrter,and etrich would
have swallowed oken glass to get me back.

04:27.230 --> 04:30.190
He had to fork over a
signing bonus of 13 mil.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.320
- Really?
- That is what I'm talking about.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.640
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

04:33.650 --> 04:37.410
So take the job at cutler,and just
devote yourself to it entirely,

04:37.420 --> 04:39.580
and give it time,all right?

04:39.590 --> 04:41.330
And if patty hewes
doesn't come after you...

04:41.340 --> 04:44.150
Yeah,well,she was not going to
make me a named partner anyway.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.120
Exactly,but at least
you're in the driver's seat.

04:47.130 --> 04:50.370
And handling the wheel's a beautiful
thing.Trust me,it's win-win.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.960
You're steering your own destiny.

04:51.970 --> 04:54.170
Right,definitely.You're right.

04:54.180 --> 04:57.760
So,when are you going to break
her heart and break the news?

04:59.990 --> 05:01.310
Tonight.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.590
Power.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.960
Good.That's it.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.160
Now,fluidity of motion.

05:08.170 --> 05:11.020
That's it,right through.Fuse
your mind and body.

05:11.030 --> 05:12.230
Right through your powerhouse.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.750
- Breathe...
- Oh,shut up!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.220
Good,let it out.Just let it out.

05:16.230 --> 05:18.490
accentuate the strength of your body.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.800
That's it.

05:19.810 --> 05:21.870
Correct your weakness.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.930
Squeeze.Correct your imbalance.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.930
And...we're done.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.670
You're going to see katie?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.650
- For how long?
- Couple days.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.010
Gonna leave after my shift.

05:33.430 --> 05:36.120
And the hospital's okay
forou to take time off work?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.880
She's my sister.They have to be.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.170
Second shelf.

05:47.570 --> 05:50.460
Flight's still got some available
seats if you're interested.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.790
You know I can't leave work right now.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.760
Of course you can'T.

05:54.770 --> 05:56.680
David,don't do this.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.190
What am I doing?

05:59.260 --> 06:01.600
Katie lied in her deposition.

06:02.150 --> 06:06.820
I am working 20-hour days trying to
get frobisher to pay for what he did.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.350
Baby,there are 5,000
employees that need patty to...

06:09.360 --> 06:13.100
Enough,okay?I've heard
all of this before.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.200
I'll call you when I land.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.230
Wait.

06:23.230 --> 06:26.130
For the plane?We have to pick one.

06:26.140 --> 06:27.600
What is it?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.170
Wedding bands.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.040
No,cocoa,don't eat that.

06:43.340 --> 06:45.750
Cocoa,don't eat that.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.120
oh,god.Leave me alone.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.990
Hey,it's katie.I'm going to
be out of town for a while.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.630
Leave a message.

07:04.130 --> 07:08.330
I just want to impress upon you
that pulling a settlement now

07:08.340 --> 07:13.990
is a move wherein tremendous risk
may outweigh negligible reward.

07:14.740 --> 07:18.410
Yeah,well,i didn't get to where
I am by playing it safe,right,ray?

07:18.710 --> 07:22.280
And when you say,where I am,art,

07:22.290 --> 07:27.000
I can only assume you don't mean
on trial for corporate malfeasance.

07:27.340 --> 07:28.670
Hey.

07:28.680 --> 07:33.780
Look,all I'm saying is,putting your
life in the hands of 12 strangers--

07:33.790 --> 07:36.700
who most certainly
will not be your peers--

07:36.710 --> 07:38.640
is a dangerous proposition.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.940
It's my job to protect
you from that at all costs.

07:41.950 --> 07:44.820
You ever play a team sport,ray?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.680
Fencing.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.500
- I specialize in épéE.
- No.

07:51.820 --> 07:54.520
No,I mean a team sport,like football.

07:54.530 --> 07:55.970
You know,god I love that game.

07:55.980 --> 08:00.130
I hate the way it's being micromanaged
right now,but i love the sport.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.610
The prevent defense-- have
you ever heard of that?

08:04.590 --> 08:07.220
Well,it's the strategy that
you're advocating right now.

08:07.230 --> 08:09.580
You roll it out when you're
not really playing to win.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.010
You're just playing not to lose.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.910
I'm afraid you lost me there,art.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.090
Yeah,well,i would rath
play straight man-to-man.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.470
You know,blitz the shit out
of them and take my chances.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.180
Chances.Look,

08:21.190 --> 08:26.220
just think of this as a small deductible
on a $2 billion insurance policy.

08:26.230 --> 08:29.670
Well,that's easy for you to say,isn't
it?'Cause it's not your money.

08:30.430 --> 08:32.640
Or your reputation.

08:34.490 --> 08:38.370
Look,katie connor is gone now.

08:38.380 --> 08:41.840
We get to trial,I can
clear myself completely.

08:41.850 --> 08:45.880
You know that girl's just
one small piece of the puzzle.

08:46.470 --> 08:51.090
And I'm worried the sun don't shine
on the same dog's tail all week.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.140
I have no idea what that means.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.460
It means we got lucky.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.130
This is my legacy.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.440
I want my name back,goddamn it.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.220
I want redemption.

09:10.230 --> 09:12.640
- Look,I understand.
- No,you don'T.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.510
You can't,ray.You don't have kids.

09:16.180 --> 09:22.120
I settle now,I admit guilt on the front
page of every newspaper in the world,

09:22.410 --> 09:24.840
and that never goes away.

09:25.130 --> 09:28.260
They'll write that on my tombstone.

09:31.460 --> 09:34.120
- Patty.
- Hey,tom.

09:34.510 --> 09:35.830
Hey,there,tommy.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.400
Ray fiske called.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.000
He pulled the settlement
off the table,which is...

09:40.010 --> 09:41.920
Exactly what we wanted.

09:41.930 --> 09:42.810
I need to talk to you.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.330
Sit.Eat.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.490
Phil's away.He never allows
me to order this crap.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.790
We have to finish everything.You
have to hide all the evidence.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.380
The dates checked out.

09:50.400 --> 09:55.280
Gregory malina dumped his frobisher
stock the exact day arthur frobisher did.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.230
Interesting.

09:57.770 --> 10:02.930
How did a waiter in the west village get
the same inside information as a big ceo?

10:02.940 --> 10:04.840
Look at you.

10:04.850 --> 10:08.930
two peas in a pod.It's
a beautiful thing.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.820
Fiske and frobisher have
no idea you're onto them,

10:11.830 --> 10:14.100
all thanks to little ellen parsons.

10:14.110 --> 10:18.820
Ewah,but the one problem is,if
we subpoena gregory immediately...

10:18.830 --> 10:21.300
Ellen will realize that
we've known all along.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.430
So let's just wait until she
finds out about gregory on her own.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.250
What if she doesn't?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.950
All right,we'll deal with it.I
mean,she's just not our priority.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.020
In the meantime,tom,I
want you to keep digging...

10:31.030 --> 10:33.600
- No.
- No?

10:35.410 --> 10:36.440
is there a problem?

10:36.450 --> 10:38.780
Yeah,there is a problem.

10:39.260 --> 10:42.860
Martin cutler extended
himself.He made an offer.

10:45.660 --> 10:49.020
- It's a good one.
- Congratulations.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.750
Look,I'm not here to negotiate,patty.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.850
he offered to make me a partner.

10:59.670 --> 11:02.540
Named partner.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.690
Plus,a signing bonus.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.530
I'd fight to keep you,tom...

11:07.540 --> 11:09.800
And a base of 950 grand.

11:09.810 --> 11:13.060
I don't think it would
be in your best interest.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.040
Cutler's offering to
make you a named partner?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.620
You have that in writing?

11:24.710 --> 11:27.150
Along with all the other points.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.780
Sounds like the deal of a lifetime.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.740
- Deb must be thrilled.
- Absolutely.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.230
You know,do me a favor,when the checks
start rolling in,don't just save up.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.790
Spend some on yourself.I
know how hard you work.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.950
- You deserve to enjoy it.
- Patty,I want you to know...

11:53.960 --> 11:56.430
Buy deb that house by
the lake that she wants.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.760
Put in a real fire pit.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.840
Don't forget to invite me over.

12:00.850 --> 12:01.850
I appreciate all you've done for me.

12:01.860 --> 12:04.770
I mean,martin's got a much
bigger shop over there,tom.

12:04.780 --> 12:08.840
Incredible room for movement.Don't
give it another moment's thought.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.910
I just wish I could top his offe

12:20.670 --> 12:22.680
would you like a beer,tommy?

12:25.530 --> 12:28.210
No.I,uh...

12:30.430 --> 12:32.140
I can't stay.

12:32.890 --> 12:35.360
Walking out of your own last supper?

12:54.860 --> 12:55.900
Hey.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.960
You pulled the settlement.I thought
we were going to work this out.

13:00.890 --> 13:04.420
Oh,we've still got a
long road ahead of us.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.810
- Win or lose,you'll be taken care of.
- Don't worry about it.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.040
I'm not just in this for myself,I
work with those people.They're friends.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.330
- And I tried to be fair with them,didn't I?
- I know.

13:15.050 --> 13:17.580
I don't know what to say.You know,I'M...

13:19.550 --> 13:21.060
I'm innocent.

13:22.810 --> 13:27.970
My wife's got diabetes,mr.Frobisher.I've
got a mortgage,medical bills.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.760
I'm sorry.Look,you have...

13:34.340 --> 13:38.050
you've really come through
for me.So even if this...

13:38.710 --> 13:41.660
even if this gets to a
trial,if we don't settle,

13:41.890 --> 13:46.950
your cooperation has been
invaluable.I want you to know that.

13:48.950 --> 13:52.750
This is what I want to do,i
want to double our arrangement.

13:54.420 --> 13:56.720
- Okay?
- Yeah.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.680
You may need to do a
few more things for me.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.360
Like what?

14:03.370 --> 14:06.510
She pleaded with us for
time to find a witness.

14:06.730 --> 14:09.050
We gave her a shot,and she blew it.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.430
The witness lied.It's not her fault.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.700
Regardless.That hundred million,gone.

14:14.710 --> 14:16.620
We got nothing.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.810
Patty hewes is useless to us.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.560
So what are you saying?

14:20.570 --> 14:23.490
Fire her.Cut out the cancer.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.370
Could we please not smoke?

14:27.380 --> 14:30.920
We're not smoking.I'm smoking.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.380
If you're smoking,I'm smoking.

14:33.670 --> 14:36.280
- Anybody else got a problem here?
- Larry,don't do this.

14:36.290 --> 14:39.100
Okay,I'll join you for
one outside in ten minutes.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.300
Can't even find my goddamn lighter.

14:41.310 --> 14:44.850
We picked ms.Hewes for
a reason.She's the best.

14:44.860 --> 14:46.390
She said there'd be some setbacks.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.410
We knew there were going
to be some ups and downs.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.280
Where the hell are the ups,karen?

14:50.290 --> 14:53.510
You're a gambler.You don't
change your horse mid-race,do you?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.590
If it's pulling up lame,i
do,then I shoot him.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.550
Oh,jesus.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.760
Two right in the head
real quick,problem solved.

14:58.770 --> 15:01.470
All right,look,we need a consensus.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.740
And for that,we may need to compromise.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.820
You got any bright ideas,kid?

15:05.830 --> 15:08.990
Yeah,actually.I do.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.830
What if I gave you a plant?

15:11.840 --> 15:14.430
Would ms.Hewes have a problem
with that in the office?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.170
I mean,how can you say no to a plant?

15:16.180 --> 15:17.260
How's your pad thai?

15:17.270 --> 15:18.590
Oh,it's delicious.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.060
Now,does that name refer
to the noodles or the sauce?

15:22.500 --> 15:25.000
Um,I think it's the whole dish.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.970
So,how's it all been going?

15:29.260 --> 15:30.780
- What?
- What?

15:30.790 --> 15:33.690
She asks me.The wedding planning?

15:34.090 --> 15:37.160
Oh,great.We had our first fight.

15:37.610 --> 15:39.420
Did he leave angry?

15:39.710 --> 15:41.550
You can't let that happen,el.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.090
You and david need to take some
time together.You're both so busy.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.660
Mom,there is no time.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.390
This is your future
husband.You need to make time.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.170
Talk to ms.Hewes.I'm
sure she'll understand.

15:52.390 --> 15:54.250
Yeah,I'll talk to patty.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.280
So,shall we try on the dress?

15:57.110 --> 15:58.100
Great.

15:58.110 --> 16:00.240
I did the resizing.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.880
Did I tell you about the scandal?

16:02.890 --> 16:04.710
- What scandal?
- At the church.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.620
Try the dress and I'll tell you.

16:08.570 --> 16:11.670
So you know about the second
service ey'rthadding on sundays?

16:11.680 --> 16:12.900
Dad told me.

16:12.910 --> 16:16.020
Well,apparently the idea is
to attract younger members.

16:16.030 --> 16:20.840
So instead of having a traditional
choir,they're going to play rock and roll music.

16:21.710 --> 16:25.340
the pastor asked your sister
to help put together a band.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.730
She's finally going to be a
rock star.Can you believe that?

16:30.830 --> 16:32.640
ellen?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.340
ellie.

16:39.150 --> 16:41.100
What's the matter?

16:46.110 --> 16:48.250
You don't want to wear my dress?

16:52.410 --> 16:54.240
I'm really glad you're here.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.740
Oh,me,too,baby.

16:57.770 --> 16:59.880
Me,too.

17:08.010 --> 17:11.099
We've come to you as a united
front because we think it's time.

17:11.109 --> 17:12.690
For what?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.079
A month ago,you fired tom.

17:14.089 --> 17:17.060
Don't tell me a story.Tell
me what you want.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.920
Appoint a new second chair.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.480
Since tom's left,there's
been a leadership vacuum.

17:24.490 --> 17:27.069
Felicia and I have
discussed it at length.

17:27.859 --> 17:32.220
And we'd like to know if you're
amenable to us sharing the position.

17:32.230 --> 17:33.890
I'm not.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.540
My second chair is indispensable to me.

17:36.550 --> 17:40.510
That person is my eyes and
ears.The job is all consuming.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.130
I'll appoint one when
someone's earned it.

17:43.140 --> 17:44.800
- But...
- Yes?

17:44.820 --> 17:46.590
I'm sorry,ms.Hewes.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.190
Karen,what happened?What's wrong?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.020
I voted against it.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.840
Voted against what?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.560
Firing you.

17:56.570 --> 17:59.790
The group hired another
attorney to represent us.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.300
Who?

18:04.310 --> 18:08.480
We want you to know,this isn't
a decision we take lightly,b...

18:08.490 --> 18:10.670
We lost confidence in pty hewes.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.150
All she's done is make
promises she can't keep.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.600
She never even consulted
us when she fired you.

18:15.610 --> 18:18.490
And you know the case
better than anyone.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.830
We called because we trust you.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.590
Well,thank you.Thank you,I,uh...

18:23.600 --> 18:24.950
I appreciate that.

18:25.570 --> 18:28.490
But you should know,at this point,um,

18:28.500 --> 18:31.840
any change in representation is a risk.

18:32.350 --> 18:35.080
It could signal weakness
to the other side.

18:35.090 --> 18:35.950
We're already weak.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.680
Yeah,the settlement's gone.

18:37.690 --> 18:41.230
- Our key witness was a bust.
- You want the job or not?

18:41.240 --> 18:44.190
Yes,I do.A hundred percent.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.500
And,uh,to be honest,I,uh...

18:47.510 --> 18:49.470
well,it couldn't come at a better time.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.810
You at a new firm now,or what?

18:51.820 --> 18:53.970
Yeah,I'm currently weighing an offer,

18:53.980 --> 18:57.000
but with this opportunity,I
need to reevaluate.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.720
I think it might be best for
you all if I go out on my own.

18:59.730 --> 19:03.820
I don't think your case should be
compromised by anyone else's agenda.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.870
What's the name of this new guy?

19:05.880 --> 19:06.690
Thomas shayes.

19:06.780 --> 19:09.230
This trial's going
to be like a cakewalk.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.100
This ain't his first rodeo,art.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.510
He graduated yale law and went
straight to rehnquist's office.

19:16.370 --> 19:18.630
Patty handpicked and groomed him.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.980
She wouldn't be where
she is today without him.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.070
Why are you bringing me down like
this?We're having a nice lunch.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.260
Don't get me wrong,we
have an opportunity here.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.530
But whoever is on the other
side in that courtroom,

19:30.540 --> 19:32.780
it's the jury you've got to worry about.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.730
What opportunity?

19:35.440 --> 19:39.580
Tom's going to want a quick
score to cement his reputation.

19:39.590 --> 19:43.720
Now,I think we can get him to
bite on a settlement figure.

19:43.730 --> 19:44.990
Why the hell would I want to do that?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.450
I just pulled a hundred
million off the table.

19:47.460 --> 19:51.230
What if I could get tom to agree to 75?

19:54.530 --> 19:56.490
Why would he do that?

19:56.770 --> 20:01.560
Patthewes couldn't wi so
there's no shame in settling.

20:01.570 --> 20:05.800
Shayes gets credit for cleaning up
patty's mess and you get off dirt cheap.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.570
Man,I've eaten too much.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.520
Think about it,art.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.760
Thomas shayes.

20:25.770 --> 20:29.050
Quite certainly a welcome
break in the weather to see you.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.740
How's the view from the first chair?

20:32.750 --> 20:33.890
I could get used to it.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.250
Well,it suits you fine.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.870
It's going to be a challenge to tackle
this all by your lonesome,don't you think?

20:41.290 --> 20:44.850
Word on the street says martin
cutler's made you a geneusro offer.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.690
Well,right now my
priority's with the clients.

20:46.700 --> 20:50.230
I'm not sure if cutler's
the right fit for them.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.050
I see.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.680
Can I have kitty rustle
up a beverage for you?

20:55.690 --> 20:59.400
A sparkling water or...do you
prefer something more potent?

20:59.810 --> 21:01.530
Not during billable hours,ray.

21:02.110 --> 21:05.500
Oh,a regular atticus
finch.Suit yourself.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.180
Well,as I'm sure you know,

21:08.480 --> 21:11.400
mr.Frobisher's withdrawn
his generous offer.

21:11.410 --> 21:12.830
So I gather.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.650
And not to tell tales out of school,

21:14.660 --> 21:18.800
but my client's a stubborn
man-- mule stubborn.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.890
Once he gets a notion,it's got.

21:21.310 --> 21:23.330
Well,I appreciate that.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.330
I'm not an unreasonable man,tom.

21:25.340 --> 21:29.230
I assume you wouldn't be here
unless you had something to offer.

21:29.750 --> 21:34.050
Maybe now that your illustrious
predecessor's out of the picture,

21:34.810 --> 21:37.900
reasonable minds can prevail.

21:37.910 --> 21:40.350
I don't see why not.

21:40.650 --> 21:42.290
Well,good.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.440
so throw me out a number,tom.

21:46.450 --> 21:49.480
Let's see if I can get
that old mule to back up.

21:49.740 --> 21:52.400
Well,I'm no patty hewes,ray.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.140
Well,thank jesus for that.

21:54.150 --> 21:57.730
But I did spend ten years with her,and
there's no number that I'll accept.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.320
Want to go to trial.

21:59.850 --> 22:03.910
I want to put your
multibillion dollar posr boy

22:03.920 --> 22:07.180
for corporate corruption
in front of a jury

22:07.190 --> 22:11.290
and watch you try to explain to them

22:11.300 --> 22:14.650
that he's not a crook.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.430
Hey,tomahawk.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.300
She couldn't be more than 23.

23:00.310 --> 23:02.630
Well,that's four years
older than the last one.

23:04.230 --> 23:05.890
The witch is dead.

23:06.130 --> 23:09.510
ding-dong.Welcome to your new life.

23:10.050 --> 23:11.670
Ah,deb,gorgeous as ever.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.930
Oh,you're sweet.

23:12.940 --> 23:13.810
This is keira.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.920
Hey,what'd you do?Did
you change something?

23:15.930 --> 23:18.920
Haircut,lose some weight,or--
oh,I know what it is.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.410
The size of these things.

23:21.420 --> 23:24.440
You should feel these.He's a
regular earl anthony over here.

23:24.450 --> 23:25.490
That's okay.Trust me.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.230
All right,we're ready.Thanks,baby.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.410
I had her ice 'em up for us.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.040
Grand siecle?

23:30.550 --> 23:32.870
Plenty more where that
came from.Here you go.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.790
Thank you,thank you.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.750
An indentured servant no more.

24:32.910 --> 24:36.010
Anyone ever tell you
you look like tom cruise?

24:38.770 --> 24:41.370
No.No,they haven'T.

24:45.730 --> 24:47.680
What's the matter?

24:48.410 --> 24:50.650
Nothing,just,uh,tough week.

24:55.310 --> 24:59.480
Well,maybe that's what I'm here for

25:03.530 --> 25:05.740
tell me about it?

25:12.550 --> 25:14.550
What are you drinking?

25:21.100 --> 25:23.500
I keep thinking maybe
someday I'll just...

25:24.070 --> 25:26.660
I'll wake up and I'll realize
something's missing,but right now,

25:26.670 --> 25:30.920
shit,you know,I turn to this one

25:30.930 --> 25:33.350
and I say,baby,pinch my dick.

25:34.130 --> 25:37.860
Is it po-- is it possible
for life to be perfect?

25:37.870 --> 25:39.270
No.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.800
What's that?

25:43.330 --> 25:44.930
Nothing

25:55.110 --> 25:57.870
So she didn't fight
for you,tommy.So what?

25:58.330 --> 25:59.670
- You know?
- Yeah.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.810
Cutler's still wet in the panties
for you and,more importantly,

26:03.820 --> 26:07.550
regardless you areyour own man.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.950
You can take this cutler offer
and parlay it into five more.

26:12.260 --> 26:15.760
Shayes,the world is your oyster,man.

26:16.610 --> 26:18.260
I'm gonna,um...

26:20.190 --> 26:22.550
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

26:23.060 --> 26:25.640
- You good?
- Yeah,yeah,I'm just...

26:58.010 --> 27:00.610
Tom,tom,tom.

27:04.510 --> 27:07.200
What the hell are you doing to yourself?

27:07.520 --> 27:09.090
Oh,I'm,I'm drunk.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.950
Yeah,well...I can see that.

27:14.610 --> 27:17.740
What are you-- what,what
are you doing here?

27:17.750 --> 27:22.880
You are in the opportunity of a lifetime
and you act like you're grieving.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.440
Getting out from under my shadow was the
best thing that could ever happen to you.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.830
You didn't,you didn't
even fight to keep me.

27:31.840 --> 27:35.480
You have more talent,

27:35.800 --> 27:40.940
more raw potential than any
attorney I have ever worked with.

27:41.980 --> 27:44.490
Well,you,you neverto me that before.

27:44.500 --> 27:48.180
Letting you leave is the only
way to get you to realize it.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.710
You're your own man,tom.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.510
It's time you stand on your
own two feet and walk away.

27:54.980 --> 27:58.060
You can be better than me.

28:10.740 --> 28:12.100
Tom!

28:12.110 --> 28:13.560
S-sweetie,sweetie,are you okay?

28:15.370 --> 28:17.320
Sweetie,talk to me.

28:17.330 --> 28:19.930
- I feel bad.
- Yeah?

28:20.570 --> 28:22.210
My apartment's right up here.

28:22.940 --> 28:24.580
How convenient.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.030
Move,move,move.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.490
Easy,easy,fellas.It's okay,it's okay.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.690
They just,they just want some money.

28:34.700 --> 28:36.390
Hey,h-hold on.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.080
Shit.

28:40.070 --> 28:42.460
You guys are going to
have to find somebody else.

28:56.270 --> 28:57.290
Enough.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.380
Enough.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.290
why are you so stupid?

29:11.300 --> 29:13.320
What the hell do you want?

29:14.010 --> 29:16.230
I did everything you told me to do.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.810
We didn't tell you to call katie connor.

29:22.210 --> 29:25.380
I burned her as a witness.It's done.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.280
You hear me?I'm done.

29:29.990 --> 29:32.300
You should be so lucky.

29:32.690 --> 29:37.700
If katie connor decides to talk,you'
be the center of this whole case.

29:37.710 --> 29:40.420
Patty hewes will be lookin to depose you

29:41.150 --> 29:44.130
now,we needo know:

29:45.180 --> 29:47.970
Can we count on your cooperation?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.330
How was your flight?

30:19.880 --> 30:21.230
Fine.

30:22.980 --> 30:25.120
Dad driving you crazy yet?

30:25.130 --> 30:27.990
They're both tiptoeing around me.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.770
What have you told them?

30:29.780 --> 30:31.960
The short version.

30:31.970 --> 30:34.030
Mom said not to worry
about losing the restaurant,

30:34.040 --> 30:38.200
dad told me the story about not
making varsity the first time around.

30:40.050 --> 30:41.940
I haven't heard that one in a while.

30:45.650 --> 30:47.940
How's my lawyer friend?

30:47.950 --> 30:49.230
She wanted to come.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.030
But she's stuck up patty's
ass and couldn't make it.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.380
She's my fiancéE.

30:53.390 --> 30:55.890
You guys found a new
caterer for the wedding yet?

30:56.380 --> 30:59.470
Katie,how long are you guys
going to be mad at each other?

30:59.740 --> 31:01.630
Is that why you're here?

31:01.640 --> 31:02.960
To referee?

31:02.970 --> 31:05.170
She feels bad about what happened.

31:05.180 --> 31:08.060
- Does she?
- Of course.

31:11.510 --> 31:13.740
How's the case going anyway?

31:15.050 --> 31:17.130
As far as I can tell,it's not good.

31:17.140 --> 31:18.480
All hell's breaking
loose,but you know what?

31:18.490 --> 31:21.590
Honestly,I don't really
care about that right now.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.680
Good,'cause they're not
going to win that thing.

31:23.690 --> 31:25.190
Why not?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.040
Because of frobisher.

31:27.050 --> 31:29.130
Because he controls everyone.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.830
For all I know,you're
on his freaking payroll.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.380
You have no idea what
I'm talking about,do you?

31:40.390 --> 31:43.350
No.Tell me.

31:46.510 --> 31:49.010
The truth doesn't even matter anymore.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.660
Katie.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.200
You can't accuse mom
and dad of tiptoeing

31:55.210 --> 31:58.160
and then shut me out when
I'm trying to talk to you.

32:03.110 --> 32:06.280
You'll have to hear details about
your sister's sordid sex life.

32:06.290 --> 32:08.390
I think I can handle at.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.790
So...congratulations.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.130
You know that the
clients came to me,right?

32:16.140 --> 32:17.520
- I know.
- I didn't,I didn't poach them.

32:17.530 --> 32:19.020
- I know,but...
- Okay.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.310
I still don't think patty
would condone us doing this.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.630
Oh,us talking?

32:25.990 --> 32:29.080
Andrew told me that you might
be joining martin cutler's firm.

32:29.090 --> 32:30.970
Yeah,well,the truth is...

32:30.980 --> 32:32.150
since the clients have come to me,

32:32.160 --> 32:34.050
I'm thinking about going out on my own,

32:34.060 --> 32:36.230
which is why i wanted to talk to you.

32:37.370 --> 32:39.630
You're getting to know
the case really well.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.120
I'm sure you heard that katie
didn't pan out as a witnes

32:43.130 --> 32:46.040
Yeah,yeah,I'm,I'm sorry about that.

32:46.050 --> 32:49.120
It turns out what you said at
the stables was right,though.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.470
Patty's kept me around even
though she lost katie as a witness.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.570
I'm sure you're there because
you're doing excellent work,

32:54.580 --> 32:57.900
which is why I'd love
for you to join me.

32:58.610 --> 33:02.860
I need somebody I can trust and you'd
make a valuable addition to the team.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.880
I'm flattered...

33:06.840 --> 33:09.160
but you don't need me,tom.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.770
You think maybe you're just
trying to get back at patty?

33:12.920 --> 33:14.820
Take what's hers?

33:14.830 --> 33:19.140
The frobisher case is
an excellent opportunity.

33:19.150 --> 33:20.570
Patty took a chance on me.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.480
I owe it to her to stick around.

33:22.490 --> 33:24.580
All right,I get it.I understand.

33:24.590 --> 33:26.250
You're still new.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.700
You want patty's approval.

33:28.960 --> 33:32.100
Just don'tet it stay that way forever.

34:09.770 --> 34:12.340
Hey,there she is!

34:12.350 --> 34:13.610
How was visiting day?

34:13.620 --> 34:15.960
There are three other girls
who play the saxophone.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.320
- Really?
- And the music teacher said

34:17.330 --> 34:19.400
she used to play with bruce springsteen.

34:19.409 --> 34:20.449
Bruce springsteen?

34:20.460 --> 34:22.000
She loved it,huh?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.100
Yeah,they all do.Martin.

34:24.110 --> 34:28.000
Place was voted best school spirit in
new york magazine three years running,hmm?

34:28.010 --> 34:30.699
Well,listen,thanks for
your help in getting her in.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.010
Yeah,look,I...

34:32.020 --> 34:34.600
I didn't do this from the
kindness of my heart,tom.

34:34.929 --> 34:35.830
I know.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.400
So,I,uh...

34:37.409 --> 34:40.449
I hear you picked up patty's
clients in the frobisher case.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.130
I've been meaning to talk to you,yeah.

34:42.139 --> 34:46.010
Look,look,uh,I'm not going to pretend
that this doesn't give you more leverage,

34:46.020 --> 34:47.260
and I'm willing to renegotiate,

34:47.270 --> 34:49.880
but I hope to shit you're not
thinking about going out on your own.

34:50.409 --> 34:52.929
The thought's crossed my mind,martin.

34:53.510 --> 34:57.930
Well,you could fight that case for
another two years,and get nothing,tom.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.590
got to go.

35:03.390 --> 35:04.830
Tom?

35:05.300 --> 35:07.780
I'm putting a clock on my offer.

35:07.790 --> 35:08.930
You got till the end of the day.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.810
I want an answer in the morning.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.860
Yes,I'm alice.You be everyone else.

35:17.870 --> 35:19.860
All right,okay.

35:19.870 --> 35:23.540
Uh,how do you like thqueen?

35:23.550 --> 35:24.480
Not at all.

35:24.490 --> 35:29.620
She's so eremely likely to win that
it's hardly worth finishing the game.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.310
How impertinent!

35:32.320 --> 35:35.120
Oh,I'm going to chop
your head right off!

35:35.130 --> 35:37.590
I am,I'm chopping it.That's it.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.100
I've got a hatchet.

35:39.110 --> 35:43.340
Uh,it's patty.She's outside.She
wants to talk to you.

35:47.970 --> 35:51.460
If I had to lose the clients,I'm
glad I lost them to you.

35:51.470 --> 35:52.210
Patty.

35:52.220 --> 35:54.320
I mean it,tom.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.760
So...

35:59.110 --> 36:01.620
you must have a lot of options now.

36:01.630 --> 36:03.510
It's an exciting time.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.390
Deciding whether to go with
cutler or strike out on your own?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.520
Yeah,I'm weighing things.

36:09.530 --> 36:11.190
Well,if you ever want to talk strategy,

36:11.200 --> 36:14.780
bounce around some ideas,I'm all yours.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.710
No strings attached.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.300
Very generous.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.770
The case is all about
gregory malina now.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.990
He's linked to frobisher somehow.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.750
Find out who's giving him orders.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.580
I will.I will.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.050
Why did you become a lawyer,tom?

36:40.200 --> 36:42.330
I've told you before.There
are a lot of reasons.

36:42.340 --> 36:46.150
- Look,patty,look,whatever you're trying to do here...
- I know exactly why i did.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.640
Because of your father.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.010
I don't give a shit
about changing the world.

36:53.730 --> 36:55.740
But I hate bullies.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.650
Look,I'm sorry that you
had to go through that.

37:00.590 --> 37:02.920
Made me who I am.

37:05.610 --> 37:08.450
You're a great number two,tom.

37:08.950 --> 37:11.050
You always were.

37:11.420 --> 37:12.630
You always told me the truth.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.670
It's going to be difficult without you.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.550
Well,andrew's capable,and,uh,felicia.Give
her a couple months.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.350
It's a huge difference between being
number one and being number two.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.890
Yes.There is.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.820
You're a number two,tom.

37:27.830 --> 37:31.110
That's your talent.That's your limit.

37:31.590 --> 37:33.910
- This is what yocameu here to tell me?
- No.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.600
I came because I care about the clients.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.500
I only want what's best for them.

37:37.510 --> 37:38.950
Take them to cutler.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.120
Oh,jesus.

37:40.130 --> 37:42.200
You'll drown out there on your own,tom.

37:42.210 --> 37:45.250
I don't want the clients
drowning with you.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.250
- You can't do it.
- Patty!

37:47.260 --> 37:48.760
You're not ready.

38:02.710 --> 38:05.140
You're in the optimal
negotiating position.All right?

38:05.150 --> 38:09.140
You're in the goddamn catbird
seat.You got options,champ.You got...

38:09.510 --> 38:11.410
cutler.You got hewes.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.120
You could go out on your own.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.890
Thank you,baby.Here,this is for you.

38:16.150 --> 38:19.410
Do not divvy it up
amongst the others,okay?

38:19.420 --> 38:21.480
Just keep it in your pocket.

38:22.530 --> 38:26.020
Look,you just got to pull the trigger.

38:29.590 --> 38:32.770
you know what I have chiseled
on a slab in my office?

38:32.780 --> 38:36.240
Audentes fortuna iuvat.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.090
Fortune favors the bold.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.340
That's right.That's right.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.480
And why are all these
clients falling into your lap?

38:42.490 --> 38:47.110
Because that is fortune,baby,and
right now,she is favoring you.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.400
tom...

39:01.120 --> 39:03.490
the world's made up
of all kinds of people,

39:03.500 --> 39:06.450
and that is a good thing,

39:06.460 --> 39:08.420
but if you're ally sitting
on the fence with this,

39:08.430 --> 39:11.690
if you need advice,maybe
you're not the guy.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.240
The guy for what?

39:13.250 --> 39:15.010
I'm incredibly selfish.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.740
I do things the way I want.Okay?

39:17.750 --> 39:22.150
And I'm greedy,and it's a
blessing,and it's also a curse.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.780
There's no law that
says you have to be me.

39:24.790 --> 39:26.380
So,what-what are you saying?

39:26.390 --> 39:28.590
I'm saying what we both know,man.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.740
You want to work for patty hewes.

40:09.790 --> 40:13.420
Patty hewes damn well better
make you a named partner.

40:13.430 --> 40:18.090
Next time I see you,hewes &
shayes better be on that door.

40:21.530 --> 40:23.290
Hewesit's early.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.220
Yes,it is.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.960
So,you have your negotiating points?

40:35.130 --> 40:38.070
There's no room to negotiate here.

41:14.570 --> 41:16.230
yes.

41:24.670 --> 41:26.380
Partner.

41:27.990 --> 41:30.230
- I just spoke to the clients.
- Really?

41:31.390 --> 41:33.250
What did you say?

41:33.690 --> 41:35.380
I told them...

41:36.100 --> 41:38.890
that no one will fight
for them like you.

41:39.490 --> 41:43.350
And if they left you,it wldou be
the biggest miske of their lives.

41:44.790 --> 41:46.240
And?

41:46.250 --> 41:49.200
And they're willing to come back.

41:51.130 --> 41:53.190
Thank you,tom.

41:56.770 --> 41:58.820
yes.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.990
no.No name on the door.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.560
It's still hewes & associates.

42:23.980 --> 42:26.180
See you at 9:00.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.210
You're back.

43:04.210 --> 43:06.140
Is that your mom on the couch?

43:06.500 --> 43:09.590
Yeah.Wedding planning
went a little long.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.120
How did it go?

43:11.130 --> 43:14.450
Good.She's pushing for my cousin's band.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.460
We need to gang up on her.

43:16.540 --> 43:18.240
I'll be glad to.

43:24.220 --> 43:26.840
How was yourrip?how's katie?

43:27.570 --> 43:29.480
She's hanging in there.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.580
Babe,I'm so sorry.I was wrong.

43:33.590 --> 43:35.720
I should have come with you.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.150
It's okay.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.750
No,it isn'T.

43:39.070 --> 43:40.580
I've been taking you for granted,

43:40.590 --> 43:46.180
and the last thing i want is
for my job to come between us.

43:47.090 --> 43:49.680
Well,I ould be apologizing to you.

43:50.480 --> 43:52.100
What for?

43:55.570 --> 43:59.400
I think this case is even more
complicated than you think.

43:59.770 --> 44:02.530
Katie told me a few things.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.620
Turns out,katie lied in her
deposition because of this asshole.

44:08.630 --> 44:10.240
Her one-night stand in florida?

44:10.250 --> 44:12.140
He set katie up to perjure herself.

44:12.150 --> 44:15.120
But katie told me she never saw him
again after that night in florida.

44:15.130 --> 44:18.450
She lied.She started seeing
him again a few weeks ago.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.660
His name's gregory malina.

44:21.670 --> 44:23.650
I suggest we subpoena him.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.810
Well,put it together asap.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.120
Good work,ellen.

44:28.130 --> 44:31.420
Tom!Glad to have you back.

44:36.610 --> 44:38.240
Someone tried to kill her?

44:39.020 --> 44:40.470
That's right.

44:43.350 --> 44:46.180
And,uh,where is this body?

44:46.190 --> 44:48.450
