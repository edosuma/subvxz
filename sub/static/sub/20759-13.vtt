09:32.530 --> 09:35.658
The best gravlax is served inside a sauna.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.162
Hey, listen, why don't you use your money

09:39.245 --> 09:41.623
to skip the line, get a new heart?

09:42.207 --> 09:44.626
Because being rich
doesn't make me more important

09:44.709 --> 09:46.419
than a kid with a bad valve

09:46.503 --> 09:48.338
or a hooker with a heart of gold.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.466
Number one killer of Desirees.

09:51.966 --> 09:55.220
Well, what if we get to Sweden,
and this heart machine

09:55.303 --> 09:56.763
needs a different plug?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.307
What if you die during sex

09:59.390 --> 10:01.601
and I'm trapped there on top of you?

10:01.684 --> 10:05.563
Lillian, you spent 40 years
stuck in the past.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.816
Now you're torturing yourself
about the future.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.651
You don't control what time I live in.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.069
I'm like Highlander!

10:11.152 --> 10:13.571
All I have is now.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.906
Be with me.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.575
Okay, I did it.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.495
Now buy a heart,
'cause I'm not gonna hang around

10:20.578 --> 10:22.122
just to watch you die.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.998
I'm not gonna buy a heart.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.585
[Artie] Uh-uh.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.796
I can't take this kind of stress.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.381
Dick Cheney cut the line.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.216
Maybe I should have
fallen in love with him.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.759
We both shot people in the face,

10:34.843 --> 10:37.178
so there's your first-date small talk
right there.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.179
[Artie] Lillian,

10:38.263 --> 10:40.557
I'm going to Scandinavia
with or without you.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.435
They have gnomes there.
I'm gonna touch a gnome.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.770
I know you are...

10:45.854 --> 10:48.148
[mockingly] "'Cause I live in the future."

10:48.231 --> 10:49.065

10:51.025 --> 10:53.945
I'd like to open a bank account
because of money.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.201
I'll need to see a valid ID.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.913
You take birth control pills?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.582

11:06.583 --> 11:08.334
Ah! Look at me!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.545
-I said look at me!
-Fine.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.130
But only if you look at me.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.133
Last month, I was implicated
in a gas station bathroom fiasco

11:15.216 --> 11:18.428
in front of Mikey,
but now I'm a $15,000-aire

11:18.511 --> 11:20.054
with a hit song on the tubes.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.764
This is it!

11:21.848 --> 11:23.641
It's time to double-Dutch back in.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.519
Maybe I'll just happen
by that construction site

11:26.603 --> 11:28.855
while enjoying a bank lollipop.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.357
No, Titus. Not like that.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.860
You've got money now. Flaunt a little.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.486
You're not gonna impress anyone
dressed like

11:35.570 --> 11:38.031
Charles Barkley got tangled up
in an old lady's clothesline.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.616
Don't you have
your own mess to figure out?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.410
Or did that career test tell you to be
a less-hot Don Rickles?

11:42.493 --> 11:44.203
I don't know, Titus.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.747
I haven't finished the test.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.833
Because I've been so obsessed
getting you back together with Mitchey.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.543
And now we have to go shopping.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.878

11:55.757 --> 11:59.135
You don't tell me how to use you!

11:59.219 --> 12:00.553
Mm!

12:02.764 --> 12:04.974
Well, college was a waste of time.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.101
What do I need to learn Mandarin for?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.561
I don't want to go to Mandar.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.772
What I want is to help people.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.565
And you don't need a degree for that.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.109
I mean, look at dogs: they help the blind

12:15.193 --> 12:17.320
and people who pretend
to be nervous on planes.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.739
They never went to Ruff-gers University

12:19.822 --> 12:22.241
or Boston Collie or UC Bark-ley

12:22.325 --> 12:24.494
or Marma-Duke or Corgi Mellon

12:24.577 --> 12:27.288
or the Mutt-sachusetts Insti-cute
of Technolo-dog.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.374
You have to tell me when to stop,
because I won't!

12:29.457 --> 12:30.792
I can't stop you.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.629
I can't control anything in this life.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.716
It's all just random and terrible.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.968
-Mm!

12:41.678 --> 12:43.638
Random. Terrible.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.889
[Kimmy] Wrong.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.350
That test told me
I should be a crossing guard.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.227
How un-random is that?

12:49.310 --> 12:52.063
And crossing guards do real good
in the real world.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.400
Getting kids safely to school,
calling drivers "pal,"

12:55.483 --> 12:57.360

12:58.987 --> 13:00.738
I'm gonna go down to the police station

13:00.822 --> 13:03.866

to be a crossing guard right now.

Also, the dogs don't hide from you.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.008
Fifteen employees start tomorrow,

30:43.091 --> 30:45.177
and I don't want to talk to them.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.553
Ever.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.889
I need someone
with your emotional intelligence.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.515
That's a real thing?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.517
I thought the dean was making it up
so I'd feel better,

30:52.601 --> 30:53.894
like when your mom says everything

30:53.977 --> 30:55.687
must have fallen out of Santa's sleigh.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.940
Oh, boy. Even I know that's this.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.694
So what do you say?

31:02.778 --> 31:04.696
Zach, I'm...

31:06.531 --> 31:07.449
in!

31:07.532 --> 31:10.827
-Get it?
-It was gotten. Yes.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.999
Hello, coworker. I'm Kimmy.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.417
What do you do here?

31:17.501 --> 31:18.460
Let me guess.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.003
Bark-eting manager.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.797
Shar Pei-roll?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.382
C-arf-O?

31:23.465 --> 31:24.966
Accounts retrievable?

31:25.050 --> 31:28.053
Don't try to stop me,
because I never will!
