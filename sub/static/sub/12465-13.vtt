This is a surprise.
Hey, there's a little--

02:56.577 --> 02:58.343
You have-- there's something
in your eyebrows.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.879
Oh yeah, that's--
that's frost.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.949
It's -30° in tundrabania
right now,

03:03.951 --> 03:07.085
Which means
it's almost the start
of swimsuit season though!

03:07.087 --> 03:08.787
Huh?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.556
Uh, look, i really
need a favor.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.991
The anniversary of the day
that i met maddie is coming up.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.427
I know!
Your meetaversary.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.029
- Maddie's so excited.
- I know, me too!

03:17.031 --> 03:19.998
Um, can you pick up her gift
at towner's sporting goods
for me?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.733
Sporting goods?
( gasps )

03:21.735 --> 03:23.468
Do they sell jewelry
at sporting goods stores

03:23.470 --> 03:25.003
In wisconsin and nobody told me?

03:26.640 --> 03:29.808
No. I'm getting her
these really cool sweatbands.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.643
Sweatbands.
( forced laugh )

03:31.645 --> 03:34.513
As in bands
that hold sweat?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.114
Yeah, i mean,
i'd get them myself,

03:36.116 --> 03:38.050
But they don't sell
sweatbands in tundrabania

03:38.052 --> 03:41.019
Because here if you sweat,
you die from frostbite.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.721
( forced laugh )

03:42.723 --> 03:44.556
And you're absolutely sure

03:44.558 --> 03:46.725
That for your meetaversary
with maddie

03:46.727 --> 03:48.827
You want to get her
sweatbands?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.029
Yeah, she's gonna
love them.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.532
She's gonna hate them! Ugh.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.901
Diggie is such a boy.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.503
But you know what?
This is maddie's relationship,

03:58.505 --> 04:00.572
So i'm not gonna butt in.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.508
Nope. My butt has...
Better things to do.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.711
Butting out!
( giggles )

04:05.713 --> 04:08.413
Ahhh.
I'm totally butting in.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.052
- Hey, mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.421
( boys scream )

04:17.558 --> 04:19.057
What have you done
with my mom?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.193
Don't ask questions, dr. P.
Just take that alien down.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.129
Parker, it's me!

04:24.131 --> 04:26.131
That's what an alien
would say!

04:28.135 --> 04:31.069
Tell us something only
dr. P's mother would know.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.772
All right, i could tell you
parker's middle name.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.040
No, mom, don't!

04:36.110 --> 04:38.076
What's wrong
with your middle name?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.879
It's the worst middle name
in the history of middle names.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.915
Consider
my interest piqued.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.918
Oh no! You're not
finding out

04:46.920 --> 04:49.087
My middle name.
Let it go, people.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.024
Oh, i'm finding out.
The people want to know.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.760
Oh, mom, i can't believe

04:54.762 --> 04:56.194
You put this stuff
on your face.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.163
No!
Okay, that tube

04:58.165 --> 05:00.098
Cost $100 and this

05:00.100 --> 05:03.201
- Was a $50 squeeze.
- What?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.936
Can you believe
how pricey that is,

05:04.938 --> 05:07.072
Parker "geraldine" rooney?

05:08.876 --> 05:11.810
Geraldine?
That'd be a step up.

05:13.047 --> 05:16.014
Mom, seriously,
you're spending
100 bucks on this

05:16.016 --> 05:18.116
And yet you won't buy
the good bologna?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.252
Boy, all bologna
is the same.

05:20.254 --> 05:23.055
- ( both gasp )
- she is an alien!

05:24.191 --> 05:27.659
Give me his middle name
and i'll stand down.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.961
- Leslie?
- Are you done?

05:34.234 --> 05:36.868
Whew.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.038

What? No.
We like barely got
to talk yesterday.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.277

to be outside.

for our meetaversary tomorrow?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.286

06:36.930 --> 06:38.808
Actually, i put more
thought than time,

06:38.809 --> 06:40.687

i still thought about it.

06:40.688 --> 06:42.566

Oh, what is that?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.275
Aged pickled fish.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.677

08:59.740 --> 09:01.940
I would like to say
this is the weirdest thing

09:01.942 --> 09:03.441
I've ever seen
in this backyard.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.377
But honestly,
it's not even close.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.215
Welcome to the ground floor
of dr. P's cosmetics.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.251
Our motto is
"you give us your loot,
we make you cute."

09:14.488 --> 09:16.922
I looked at the ingredients
in your tube of beauty

09:16.924 --> 09:18.490
And realized we could
make it ourselves.

09:18.492 --> 09:21.826
Wait, wait, you're making
beauty products?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.929
It was easy. We just
had to farm some honey,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.497
Get algae
from reggie's fish tank

09:25.499 --> 09:27.999
And go
to the stevens point
caverns to harvest

09:28.001 --> 09:29.301
Bat poop.

09:31.004 --> 09:35.073
Now, you could go to the store
and pay $100 for face cream.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.275
Or...

09:37.277 --> 09:39.744
You can try our cream
for the low, low price

09:39.746 --> 09:41.279
Of two months' worth
of bologna.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.882
The good bologna.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.152
Wow. Homemade cosmetics
from sixth graders,

09:47.154 --> 09:48.320
How tempting.
( chuckles )

09:49.756 --> 09:51.289
Go ahead
and be skeptical,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.091
But the only thing
you have to lose is

09:53.093 --> 09:54.759
Years off your face.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.163
It works. I'm 25
but you'd never know it.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.098
( giggles )

10:00.100 --> 10:02.233
Okay, i'll give it a try.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.270
Smart move,
mrs. Roondog.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.173
It's gonna make you more
beautiful than you already are.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.176
Oh, i am so close
to telling you parker's
middle name.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.178
- Mother!
- Huh?

10:13.179 --> 10:15.179
- I will release
the bees on you.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.853

10:27.494 --> 10:30.428
Oh, hi, honey.
Feel my elbows.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.132
Weird, but i'm game.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.801
( gasps )
they're so smooth!

10:36.803 --> 10:40.071
Right? You should feel what
this cream did for my feet.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.272
Ew.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.273
Wait...

10:42.275 --> 10:44.209
No, ew.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.278
Mom, i need to talk to you
about something.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.115
- Oh.
- So, diggie asked me to help
pick up a gift for maddie.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.851
Oh, that is so sweet.
What did he get her?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.819
Um...

10:54.821 --> 10:56.287
Sweatbands.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.289
- No!
- Yes.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.126
This is diggie's idea
of a romantic gift.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.561
Ugh, boys!

11:03.563 --> 11:06.164
You know, for our first
wedding anniversary

11:06.166 --> 11:08.433
Your father
got me a step stool.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.503
Okay, and don't you wish

11:11.505 --> 11:15.006
Dad had had a helper
to stop that gift disaster
before it happened?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.142
- Every time i change
a light bulb.
- Ha!

11:17.144 --> 11:20.311
Okay, good,
because i sort of helped
diggie with maddie's gift

11:20.313 --> 11:23.214
Even though
he doesn't know i helped him.
Is that totally wrong?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.183
Because i got this
and i think it's super cute.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.019
Oh, that is an adorable
♪ ridgewood porcupine. ♪

11:29.389 --> 11:31.556
You did a very nice thing
for your sister.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.525
Thanks, mom.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.493
Although it does feel
like something's missing,
doesn't it?

11:35.495 --> 11:38.363
How about we lose
the sweatbands and add...

11:38.365 --> 11:40.265
- This.
- Oh.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.101
- Ahhh.
- Oh.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.203
You're welcome, diggie.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.338
Do you always have
a tiara in your bag?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.008
- You never know
when you might need one.
- Mm-hmm.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.081
Hey.
What's up, hobbit?

11:57.184 --> 12:00.251
Something's different.
Did you start bathing
with soap?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.490
You insulted boris.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.258
Quarter scoop.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.227
Next!

12:09.229 --> 12:11.496
I was starving,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.365
And not just for food,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.233
But also for the chit-chat
over chipped beef.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.435
So i decided
to take a page

12:17.437 --> 12:19.971
From liv and maddie's
twin book.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.108
Boris?
Your darling
baby poochie pie?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.076
Sylvia, syl, syl.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.645
I would never make fun of him.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.314
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.051
Was my identical twin brother
here yesterday?

12:33.053 --> 12:36.154
You don't have
an identical twin.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.389
Sure i do.
His name is michael.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.259
He just got back from europe
where he's been studying chess.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.962
He enjoys strudel making
and pretending to be me

12:43.964 --> 12:46.030
And ruining my good name!

12:47.167 --> 12:49.634
You never mentioned
a twin before.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.170
Yeah? You never mentioned
the hair coming out
of your ears,

12:52.172 --> 12:54.072
But we both
know it's there.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.407
If you really have a twin,

12:56.409 --> 12:59.177
You bring him here tomorrow
to apologize!

13:00.113 --> 13:01.780
Oh.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.382
You want my identical
twin brother here tomorrow.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.217
Okay. Not a problem.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.287
So how about a double scoop
of those fluffy
mashed potatoes

13:09.289 --> 13:10.722
As a show of good faith?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.660
You're right.
Tomorrow's perfect.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.395
( forced laugh, sobs )

13:22.135 --> 13:25.136
Oh yes!
My meetaversary gift
from diggie is here!

13:27.340 --> 13:29.207
Nope, no.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.176
He wants to open
these together

13:31.178 --> 13:33.244
Over facegab.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.714
I can do that.
I'm a very patient individual.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.187
But not today because
it's our meetaversary!

13:42.189 --> 13:43.655
Ahh!

13:43.657 --> 13:46.224
I was so happy to give
maddie and diggie

13:46.226 --> 13:48.059
The greatest
meetaversary ever.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.128
I bet that cute
little porcupine

13:50.130 --> 13:53.131
Is sopping wet
with tears of joy right now.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.572
Hey!

14:00.574 --> 14:02.340
Hey-yyy.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.078
Um, wow.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.247
Looks like
a crime scene in here.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.548
What happened?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.250
Love died.

14:14.454 --> 14:18.089
Yeah. Diggie
sent me this stupid
stuffed porcupine,

14:18.091 --> 14:20.124
And i thought it was a gag
and there was something
good inside,

14:20.126 --> 14:22.427
So i tore it apart.
And when there was
nothing good inside

14:22.429 --> 14:24.195
I tore it apart some more.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.367
Uh, why is
a stuffed porcupine stupid?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.170
I mean, you two are both
ridgewood porcupines.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.205
That sounds really
meaningful and-and--

14:34.207 --> 14:36.374
And touching to me.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.511
Well, not compared
to the incredibly meaningful
gift that i sent him.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.082
What did you send him?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.150
Please don't be sweatbands.
Please don't be sweatbands.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.553
Please don't be sweatbands.
Please don't be
sweatbands.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.622
- I got him sweatbands.
- No!

14:50.624 --> 14:52.156
( gasps )

14:54.694 --> 14:57.629
No... Way.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.664
Ha!
Sweatbands.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.200
What a great gift.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.202
Why is that a great gift?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.273
Okay, this is gonna
sound really silly,

15:08.275 --> 15:10.375
But the day that
diggie and i met

15:10.377 --> 15:14.112
I had just
finished whipping him
in basketball and...

15:16.549 --> 15:20.251
Hey, sweaty.
You just lost to someone
a foot shorter than you.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.230
Better get
a rematch, rooney.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.698
( snorting giggle )

15:35.769 --> 15:39.337
Ohhh, sweatbands have
huge emotional meanings

15:39.339 --> 15:42.173
And ramifications
and nuances.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.243
Yeah, but i guess
the whole thing

15:45.245 --> 15:47.879
Just meant nothing to him.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.281
I kinda feel
like an idiot.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.219
Maddie...

15:56.690 --> 15:59.290
Hi. So i have
something to tell you.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.259
( chuckling )
and get ready to laugh.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.129
Yeah, she...
Did not laugh.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.198
Liv, how could you?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.134
Well, the good news is
you don't have to be mad
at diggie anymore.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.537
Uh, you're right.
I'm not mad at diggie.
I'm mad at you!

16:12.539 --> 16:14.639
- But i was just trying to help.
- Well, you didn't!

16:14.641 --> 16:16.874
Because of you,
when diggie facegabbed me

16:16.876 --> 16:19.477
I yelled, "how could you
be so stupid?" and then
i hung up on him.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.280
What?
No, um, okay.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.766
We'll just call him back.
We'll make it right.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.251
Well, i can't!
The tundrabanian internet
is down until tomorrow.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.387
Liv, you've ruined
my meetaversary.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.323
- Well, i didn't mean--
- well, you did!

16:32.325 --> 16:35.226
Can you just stay out
of my relationship
with diggie

16:35.228 --> 16:37.628
And while you're at it,
might as well stay
out of my life!

16:45.372 --> 16:48.172
( mimicking french accent )
uh huh huh! Greetings, madame.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.208
I am michael,
joey's twin,

16:50.210 --> 16:53.578
The jokester who you found
not so funny.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.413
( laughs )

16:55.415 --> 16:57.582
Mmm, you look like joey.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.584
Oh, we're identical twins.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.386
What aren't you
understanding about this?

17:01.388 --> 17:04.222
Anyway, please accept
my apology.

17:04.224 --> 17:08.760
Your dog is adorable.
There is no need to punish
my brother joey,

17:08.762 --> 17:11.362
Of whom i am identical to,
and sometimes

17:11.364 --> 17:13.364
Pretend to be.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.502
When you insult boris,

17:17.504 --> 17:19.637
You no talk with accent.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.341
Well, this is
all part of the ruse
to pretend i am joey.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.442
( exhales )

17:24.444 --> 17:25.843
( normal accent )
nerd stuff.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.212
What is happening?
Booyah!

17:28.214 --> 17:31.315
( sighs )
huh huh huh!

17:32.685 --> 17:35.653
Get joey.
I want to see him too.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.356
Oh. Joey?

17:38.358 --> 17:42.293
My pleasure.
Once again, your dog
is <i> magnifique!</i>

17:45.231 --> 17:46.297
Hey.
( laughs )

17:47.333 --> 17:48.966
Michael said you
wanted to see me.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.736
You are both wearing
the same outfit.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.305
Oh, uh, well, our mother

17:54.307 --> 17:55.940
Used to dress us alike as kids,

17:55.942 --> 17:58.309
And michael never
grew out of it.

17:59.813 --> 18:03.314
I want to see you
and your brother together

18:03.316 --> 18:07.285
- At the same time.
- O...Kay. ( chuckles )

18:07.287 --> 18:09.887
I'll get him.
But for the record,
you have trust issues

18:09.889 --> 18:11.756
That you really need
to work through.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.827
Here we are, sylvia,

18:15.829 --> 18:18.329
Me and my identical
twin brother michael.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.398
( flatly )
cute dog, huh huh huh.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.967
( mimics accent )
huh huh huh!

18:24.037 --> 18:26.270
You're not buying
any of this, are you?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.706
No, but i wanted to see
how far you were going
to go with it.

18:33.046 --> 18:36.781
Look, sylvia, i didn't know
you would be so sensitive
about your dog.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.049
I'm really, really sorry.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.318
Tell me what i gotta do

18:40.320 --> 18:42.420
To get us back
to how we used to be.

18:42.422 --> 18:46.491
It's not me that you have
to apologize to.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.866
Okay, is it just me

18:54.868 --> 18:56.801
Or is boris maybe,

18:56.803 --> 18:59.470
Slightly,
just a little bit dead?

19:00.874 --> 19:02.807
He lives on in my heart.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.408
Now apologize.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.982
Boris, please accept
my apology.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.351
Now make smoochy-woochy

19:13.353 --> 19:15.319
With my poochie poochie.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.390
Mwah!

19:20.894 --> 19:23.027
Mmm-mwuah!

19:23.029 --> 19:25.696
( spitting ) ugh!

19:25.698 --> 19:26.998
We good now,
butt-breath?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.501
Oh, i am good,
but you probably have fleas.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.342
So, your mom liked
the skin cream.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.712
Yep, and i'm up
to my ears in bologna.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.482
And not just any bologna,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.417
Lundsford's ranch bologna.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.718
The best bologna of all!

19:49.622 --> 19:51.522
More bologna-ade?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.792
I'd be delighted.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.036
Karen:
<i>Parker!</i>

20:05.038 --> 20:07.705
Ooh, she sounds mad.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.041
Guard the bologna!

20:10.043 --> 20:12.043
<i>( door opens )</i>

20:19.953 --> 20:22.019
Whoa.
What happened?

20:22.021 --> 20:24.121
Your cream happened.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.991
Reggie, you will now hear
parker's middle name.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.026
- No, mom, no!
- Yes.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.862
Parker's middle name is--

20:31.864 --> 20:33.931
It's bad enough that
my best friend knows.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.733
You guys aren't finding out.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.403
( laughing )
oh man, you hate your son.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.407
Well, i never intended
his name to be punishment,

20:43.409 --> 20:44.909
But i'm glad it is!

20:44.911 --> 20:48.112
I can't wait to tell everyone
at school your name is parker--

20:48.114 --> 20:51.015
Nothing to see here, people.
Move along!

20:53.620 --> 20:55.886
( groans, bangs keys )

20:55.888 --> 20:57.154
Hey, what are you doing?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.956
Trying to get diggie
back on facegab

20:58.958 --> 21:00.791
- For 24 hours now.
- ( bangs keys )

21:00.793 --> 21:02.727
Okay, be careful
with your computer.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.028
( bangs )
it's liv's.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.096
Oh, okay, carry on.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.934
Okay, maddie.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.070
I am so sorry that i messed up
your meetaversary,

21:13.072 --> 21:15.573
But i got you a second gift
and i think it's gonna
really make up for it.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.875
Liv, i don't want
another gift from you.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.544
And there is absolutely
nothing that you can do
to make this up to me.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.979
No, no, no, okay,
listen, maddie.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.048
I know what i did wrong.
I should have put the sweatbands

21:24.050 --> 21:25.883
On the porcupine
before i gave it to you.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.052
Liv, i never wanted
a porcupine.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.887
Are you sure?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.689
Not even...

21:31.691 --> 21:33.691
This porcupine?

21:38.031 --> 21:40.064
Happy meetaversary,
rooney.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.699
Diggie!

21:43.069 --> 21:45.236
Wow.
Oh wow, you're still cold.

21:45.238 --> 21:48.039
Yeah, i've been told that
stays with you for a while.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.741
How are you even here
right now?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.644
I actually contacted
the tundrabanian consulate,

21:53.646 --> 21:56.113
And they agreed to fly diggie
out for the weekend.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.950
The only catch is that
i do have to do a concert there
over my spring break, but--

21:59.952 --> 22:02.787
Oh, spring break, yeah.
That's their fourth winter.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.655
There are seven.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.091
Each one colder
than the last.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.661
Liv, thank you so much
for doing this for us.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.596
This is the best
meetaversary gift ever.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.632
O...Kay.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.604
- ( maddie laughing )
- oh, oh, oh!

22:20.606 --> 22:23.841
- What's that, rooney?
Swish...!
- Ohhh!

22:25.144 --> 22:26.677
Are you sure you don't want
to take this off--

22:26.679 --> 22:28.012
Hey, whoa, ahh,

22:28.014 --> 22:30.214
Still... Still cold.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.018
This is really nice.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.055
Yeah. I kinda got used
to just seeing you
on a computer.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.293
Yeah, now we're all
up close and personal,

22:42.295 --> 22:44.528
For like a few days.

22:46.165 --> 22:48.132
Um...

22:48.134 --> 22:51.168
You know our--
our first kiss was

22:51.170 --> 22:53.104
Over the computer.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.741
I was kinda wondering

22:56.743 --> 22:58.943
Maybe what it would
be like in person.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.079
Yeah, me too.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.017
Diggie, my man!
Ha ha!

23:07.019 --> 23:08.986
Mmm!

23:08.988 --> 23:11.088
Are you in town just for me?

23:11.090 --> 23:14.125
Oh, you know tomorrow's
our meetaversary.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.326
Come here.
