WEBVTT

00:00.998 --> 00:02.397
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:02.397 --> 00:05.602
Chef Ramsay heads to Boston's
Little Italy

00:05.602 --> 00:07.094
to help two brothers...

00:07.094 --> 00:08.327
Anthony, don't take
the wrong stuff.

00:08.327 --> 00:09.627
I'll kill you.

00:09.627 --> 00:11.127
Who are at war
with each other.

00:11.127 --> 00:12.560
Anthony, you've ruined
the business.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.227
I hate his attitude.
I hate working with him.

00:15.227 --> 00:16.427
Ahh!

00:16.427 --> 00:18.160
While one fights
for respect...

00:18.160 --> 00:20.027
He doesn't respect me,
and I don't respect him

00:20.027 --> 00:22.160
because I think
he laid down and died.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.860
The other...
Food sucks anyway.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.260
Is at the end
of his rope.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.060
Gonna get a complaint
either way.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.760
They're gonna wait too long
or they're gonna send it back.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.000
And the family
is losing hope.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.560
And the family
is losing hope.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.360
He feels so defeated.
I can see it.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.160
Now Chef Ramsay faces one of
his toughest challenges yet.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.827
It's like
a ticking time bomb

00:37.827 --> 00:39.693
that's about to explode.

00:39.693 --> 00:41.360
Fixing an Italian restaurant

00:41.360 --> 00:43.527
in the most competitive part
of the city.

00:43.527 --> 00:45.160
You can't even be bothered
to cook fresh food?

00:45.160 --> 00:46.760
Come on!

00:46.760 --> 00:48.660
With an owner who has
lost his will.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
Do you wanna do this?
I don't know.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.160
Well, you have to make
a decision today.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.727
It's going to be
a battle in Boston.

00:54.727 --> 00:55.960
Come on!

00:55.960 --> 00:58.193
I'm not  cooking.
I'm not doing it.

00:58.193 --> 00:59.460
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.000
Might not go back in.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.627
Might not go back in.

01:19.493 --> 01:22.860
the city of Boston
has many great attributes,

01:22.860 --> 01:24.793
but the treasure
of the North End

01:24.793 --> 01:26.427
is its outstanding
Italian food

01:26.427 --> 01:30.000
served at over 150
Italian restaurants.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.393
served at over 150
Italian restaurants.

01:30.393 --> 01:32.660
The first
fine dining establishment

01:32.660 --> 01:34.460
in this neighborhood
was Davide,

01:34.460 --> 01:36.727
which opened in 1982.

01:36.727 --> 01:38.260
Davide, back in the heyday,

01:38.260 --> 01:40.593
it was the number one Italian
restaurant in Boston.

01:40.593 --> 01:41.927
It was incredible.

01:41.927 --> 01:42.993
There was always a line
at the door.

01:42.993 --> 01:44.460
What's the name?

01:44.460 --> 01:46.860
If you didn't make reservations
three weeks in advance,

01:46.860 --> 01:47.893
you could not get in.

01:47.893 --> 01:49.360
In 1997,

01:49.360 --> 01:51.993
Then-maitre d Frank
and his brother Anthony

01:51.993 --> 01:54.393
fulfilled a dream
by purchasing Davide

01:54.393 --> 01:56.693
at the height
of its popularity.

01:56.693 --> 01:57.760
This is amazing.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.960
When we bought
the restaurant,

01:58.960 --> 01:59.993
we were making money.

01:59.993 --> 02:00.000
It felt like we hit
a gold mine.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.660
It felt like we hit
a gold mine.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.260
How are they liking
the chicken special?
They like it.

02:04.260 --> 02:05.793
I'm working with Frankie,

02:05.793 --> 02:07.627
and my life is wonderful.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.627
The restaurant
started off strong,

02:10.627 --> 02:13.427
but within
the first couple years

02:13.427 --> 02:15.927
Frank found out that Anthony
was embezzling money.

02:25.327 --> 02:27.760
He was addicted
to painkillers, heroin.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.000
He's been in detox,
in jail, out of jail.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.460
He's been in detox,
in jail, out of jail.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.860
The responsibility
of keeping anything open

02:32.860 --> 02:35.727
was always
on my shoulders basically.

02:35.727 --> 02:37.127
There was no one else
there to help.

02:37.127 --> 02:38.993
It's 3:30.
You gotta get ready for dinner.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.327
What's the difference?

02:40.327 --> 02:41.793
I'm gonna get
anyways tonight.

02:41.793 --> 02:43.227
No, you're not.

02:43.227 --> 02:46.827
When Anthony left,
Frank gave up.

02:46.827 --> 02:48.260
He's broken mentally
and physically.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.394
Oh, my God.

02:50.394 --> 02:51.994
Can't work like this.

02:51.994 --> 02:56.260
And little by little,

02:56.260 --> 02:57.560
It's broken a restaurant.

02:59.827 --> 03:00.000
Since I've been back,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.594
Since I've been back,

03:02.594 --> 03:04.294
I am not the same person.

03:04.294 --> 03:05.660
Hi, good evening.

03:05.660 --> 03:08.260
I'm in recovery.
I'm doing well.

03:08.260 --> 03:09.560
Those days are behind me.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.427
I'm here.
I'm responsible.

03:11.427 --> 03:13.194
And I'm making the restaurant
a priority.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.927
Right this way.

03:14.927 --> 03:17.194
Let's forget about the past
and move on.

03:17.194 --> 03:19.927
And I don't think he has.
I don't think he can.

03:19.927 --> 03:21.460
Shut the  up,
take the food

03:21.460 --> 03:23.194
That's up in the window,
and come back.

03:23.194 --> 03:25.427
That's all I ask.
Go away.

03:25.427 --> 03:27.127
But at the same time,

03:27.127 --> 03:29.294
he should take some
responsibility of giving up

03:29.294 --> 03:30.000
and not putting
the whole blame on me

03:30.000 --> 03:31.527
and not putting
the whole blame on me

03:31.527 --> 03:32.994
because of what I did.

03:32.994 --> 03:35.060
Anthony, don't take
the wrong stuff.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.394
I'll kill you.

03:36.394 --> 03:39.227
My relationship with Anthony
is not at its best.

03:39.227 --> 03:40.827
This is it.

03:40.827 --> 03:42.427
You know,
he has no more chances.

03:42.427 --> 03:43.694
It's all over.

03:45.127 --> 03:47.927
Get the  out.
Don't waste my time.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.294
Frankie will not
listen to me.

03:49.294 --> 03:52.194
Hey, moron,
this is your table!

03:52.194 --> 03:53.594
Get the  outta here,
really.

03:53.594 --> 03:57.260
Think he's all, you know,
just hurt and spiteful.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.000
My God, Anthony,
Anthony,

04:00.000 --> 04:00.227
My God, Anthony,
Anthony,

04:00.227 --> 04:03.127
why don't you
go kill yourself?

04:03.127 --> 04:06.127
I think that
Frankie has a lot

04:06.127 --> 04:09.427
Of pent-up anger
and resentment with Anthony.

04:09.427 --> 04:10.894
If it can't be put aside,

04:10.894 --> 04:13.727
I really can't see
the restaurant succeeding.

04:13.727 --> 04:17.127
It's killing them.

04:17.127 --> 04:20.394
We need help
extremely badly

04:20.394 --> 04:23.327
because we've been living
month-to-month.

04:23.327 --> 04:25.660
Are we gonna be able
to take checks this week?

04:25.660 --> 04:27.494
If we close the door
tomorrow,

04:27.494 --> 04:29.294
we would be out
a million dollars.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.527
Frankie and me
always have the conflict.

04:38.527 --> 04:40.060
That's why Chef Ramsay

04:40.060 --> 04:43.127
I think is the answer
to help us.

04:43.127 --> 04:45.994
If things don't turn around,
we will close the doors.

04:51.994 --> 04:55.027
Right, the only way
to understand Boston properly

04:55.027 --> 04:56.494
is jump on one of these
trolleys, 'cause those guys

04:56.494 --> 04:58.727
have really got their fingers
on the pulse.

04:58.727 --> 05:00.000
Morning.
Welcome aboard.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.894
Morning.
Welcome aboard.

05:00.894 --> 05:01.927
Good to see you, man.
Good to see you.

05:01.927 --> 05:02.827
Teddy?
Ted.

05:02.827 --> 05:04.094
Right, how are you?

05:04.094 --> 05:05.194
I'm very good, thank you.
Where are you headed?

05:05.194 --> 05:06.327
North End, please.

05:06.327 --> 05:07.761
One of my favorite places.

05:07.761 --> 05:09.361
You ever heard of
the restaurant Davide?

05:09.361 --> 05:11.127
Well, it's funny you say that.
It's on our tour route.

05:11.127 --> 05:12.994
We drive by it
probably four times a day,

05:12.994 --> 05:15.094
and I don't know anybody
that's really ever gone.

05:15.094 --> 05:17.061
That's not good news.
It's not great news.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.294
So many restaurants
in Boston,

05:20.294 --> 05:21.827
and we recommend
many of them.

05:21.827 --> 05:24.561
And I don't know a driver that
really recommends Davide.

05:24.561 --> 05:26.827
Unbelievable.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.594
Wish me luck.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.000
Well, good luck at Davide.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.427
Well, good luck at Davide.

05:30.427 --> 05:31.827
It's nice to see you, Gordon.
Good to see you, buddy.

05:34.927 --> 05:36.594
Davide.

05:36.594 --> 05:38.727
Down below.

05:38.727 --> 05:40.661
Whoa.

05:40.661 --> 05:41.894
Hello.
How are you?

05:41.894 --> 05:43.061
Well, thank you.
How are you?

05:43.061 --> 05:44.194
Very good.
Nice to meet you.

05:44.194 --> 05:45.461
Good to see you.
Anthony gesualdi.

05:45.461 --> 05:46.727
Anthony, Gordon Ramsey.
Good to see you, buddy.

05:46.727 --> 05:48.227
You are the--

05:48.227 --> 05:50.261
I'm one of the owners.
owners, one of them?

05:50.261 --> 05:52.361
You and?
My brother Frank.

05:52.361 --> 05:53.727
He's in the kitchen.
What a quaint little place.

05:53.727 --> 05:55.127
How long have you owned it?

05:55.127 --> 05:56.427
Uh, 1997.

05:56.427 --> 05:57.994
What was the last thing
you changed here?

05:57.994 --> 06:00.000
We did the booths over,
and we took the wallpaper off.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.194
We did the booths over,
and we took the wallpaper off.

06:02.194 --> 06:04.527
We haven't changed as much
with the times, I believe.

06:04.527 --> 06:08.027
Time moved on, and Frankie
stayed right in 1997.

06:08.027 --> 06:12.227
And now he won't change
because he gave up.

06:12.227 --> 06:13.327
That simple.

06:13.327 --> 06:14.361
Let's get
everybody together

06:14.361 --> 06:15.994
and have a proper
staff meeting, yeah?

06:15.994 --> 06:18.127
Please.
Thanks, Anthony.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.261
Hello.

06:19.261 --> 06:21.327
Hi, Maria.
The mother.

06:21.327 --> 06:22.827
Wow, okay,
you work here as well?

06:22.827 --> 06:25.161
She keeps the peace.
She's the negotiator.

06:25.161 --> 06:26.261
And this is?

06:26.261 --> 06:27.827
I'm Deborah.
Deborah, nice to see you.

06:27.827 --> 06:30.000
My wife.
Oh, your wife.
Okay, great.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.194
My wife.
Oh, your wife.
Okay, great.

06:30.194 --> 06:32.661
Frank.
Frank, good to
see you, buddy.

06:32.661 --> 06:34.627
And Frank is your
big brother?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.727
Yeah.
Fantastic.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.027
Hi, I'm Kim.
I'm Frank's wife.

06:38.027 --> 06:39.361
Frank's wife,
brilliant.

06:39.361 --> 06:41.061
Take a seat, please.

06:41.061 --> 06:44.094
First of all,
let's find out the truth.

06:44.094 --> 06:45.227
How long
has it been slow?

06:45.227 --> 06:47.894
At least a good three years.

06:47.894 --> 06:49.127
And you're in the kitchen,
you cook?

06:49.127 --> 06:51.794
My job was in the dining room
all my life.

06:51.794 --> 06:53.094
I ran the restaurant.

06:53.094 --> 06:54.661
The kitchen I learned,
I picked up.

06:54.661 --> 06:55.727
How did you buy it?

06:55.727 --> 06:56.727
My mother
gave me the money,

06:56.727 --> 06:58.594
and me and my brother

06:58.594 --> 07:00.000
ended up buying it together.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.894
ended up buying it together.

07:00.894 --> 07:02.261
Okay, so it's literally
a 50/50 business.

07:02.261 --> 07:03.961
Everything's supposed
to be 50/50.

07:03.961 --> 07:06.594
What does that mean?
Help me out.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.494
Anthony has been in and out
of the restaurant

07:08.494 --> 07:11.727
over the 13 years.

07:11.727 --> 07:14.461
What happened?

07:14.461 --> 07:16.661
You know, I'm hooked
on painkillers.

07:16.661 --> 07:17.961
I took money,
got in trouble,

07:17.961 --> 07:18.861
went to jail.

07:18.861 --> 07:22.161
The whole nine yards.

07:22.161 --> 07:24.961
I worked here seven days
a week by myself.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.527
Frankie got left with
the whole.

07:26.527 --> 07:27.861
It got to him.

07:27.861 --> 07:28.961
Got depressed
and got burnt out.

07:28.961 --> 07:30.000
Money went down
every year.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.394
Money went down
every year.

07:30.394 --> 07:33.094
Naturally.

07:33.094 --> 07:34.894
I did damage
to the business,

07:34.894 --> 07:37.427
but he cannot
get over the past.

07:37.427 --> 07:40.027
If you can't put the past
behind you, we can't go on.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.727
When you've been burned
six times it's hard to say,

07:41.727 --> 07:45.061
"Yeah, okay,
that's in the past."

07:45.061 --> 07:46.594
Anthony is trying
to make amends.

07:46.594 --> 07:48.994
Everything he's done
is being criticized.

07:48.994 --> 07:51.527
Every little thing
nitpicked.

07:51.527 --> 07:53.161
'Cause of the past?

07:53.161 --> 07:56.561
Because of the past.

07:56.561 --> 07:57.861
You know, everything
is "Anthony, Anthony,"

07:57.861 --> 07:59.427
and I think he doesn't
take any blame

07:59.427 --> 08:00.000
for anything that's
happened anywhere.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.494
for anything that's
happened anywhere.

08:00.494 --> 08:01.527
Is that right?

08:01.527 --> 08:04.061
What's for me to blame?

08:04.061 --> 08:05.294
I was gone.

08:05.294 --> 08:08.261
The business,
it was, like, abandoned.

08:08.261 --> 08:09.627
And nothing was done.

08:09.627 --> 08:11.961
Anthony, you've ruined
the business.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.427
You've destroyed it.

08:16.427 --> 08:18.694
I never wanted to be in
the restaurant by myself.

08:18.694 --> 08:19.794
I mean, come on.

08:19.794 --> 08:21.594
I'm mad, I'm pissed.

08:21.594 --> 08:22.661
I'll  tell you
to go  yourself

08:22.661 --> 08:24.461
for the
you put me through.

08:24.461 --> 08:25.894
Oh, my God, Frank.

08:25.894 --> 08:28.927
Anthony never apologized,
never.

08:28.927 --> 08:30.000
It's like, "Kid, don't you
understand what you've done?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.561
It's like, "Kid, don't you
understand what you've done?

08:31.561 --> 08:33.294
You've put me in the position
I'm in now."

08:33.294 --> 08:35.961
I could  beat him up.

08:35.961 --> 08:38.261
Here's the problem,
I think.

08:38.261 --> 08:41.094
He doesn't respect me
for anything

08:41.094 --> 08:42.561
because of the past
and everything.

08:42.561 --> 08:44.027
And I don't respect him
because I think

08:44.027 --> 08:46.494
he laid down
and  died.

08:46.494 --> 08:48.694
Wow.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.527
Coming up,
Chef Ramsay digs in.

08:51.527 --> 08:53.394
It's really spongy
and horrible.

08:53.394 --> 08:56.327
And uncovers a terrifying
truth about Davide.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.261
He is done.
He's on the floor.

08:59.261 --> 09:00.000
He feels so defeated.
I can see it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.494
He feels so defeated.
I can see it.

09:01.494 --> 09:04.461
Then Frank not only loses
control of the kitchen...

09:04.461 --> 09:06.461
That's the way it is.
Don't come back with it.

09:06.461 --> 09:07.494
But also his mind.

09:07.494 --> 09:08.985
Ahh!

09:08.985 --> 09:11.485
Can Chef Ramsay get Frank
back on track...

09:11.485 --> 09:12.985
Why did you send it?
We're screwed.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.718
I'm not  cooking.
I'm not doing it.

09:14.718 --> 09:17.052
Or is this owner
and this restaurant

09:17.052 --> 09:20.009
Impossible to save?

09:27.243 --> 09:29.176
Within minutes
of his arrival,

09:29.176 --> 09:31.409
Chef Ramsay was confronted
with the bad blood

09:31.409 --> 09:33.443
that exists between
the two brothers.

09:33.443 --> 09:34.709
Anthony, you've ruined
the business.

09:34.709 --> 09:37.109
And I don't respect him
because I think

09:37.109 --> 09:38.643
he laid down
and  died.

09:38.643 --> 09:39.843
And while his relationship
with Anthony

09:39.843 --> 09:41.443
is at the breaking point,

09:41.443 --> 09:43.709
Frank wants to prove
that his cooking skills

09:43.709 --> 09:45.143
have not suffered.

09:45.143 --> 09:47.276
Thanks.
And this is?

09:47.276 --> 09:48.243
Andrew.
Andrew.
Thank you, Andrew.

09:48.243 --> 09:49.376
Recommendations?

09:49.376 --> 09:50.876
There isn't a bad thing
on the menu.

09:50.876 --> 09:52.676
Caesar salad's made
right in the dining room.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.530
Tableside?
Yep.

09:53.530 --> 09:54.543
Tableside?
Yep.

09:54.543 --> 09:55.676
Okay, good, nice.

09:55.676 --> 09:57.643
There is great potential here.

09:57.643 --> 09:59.409
We just need someone like
Gordon Ramsay to come in,

09:59.409 --> 10:01.543
because the relationship
between Frank and Anthony

10:01.543 --> 10:03.376
is kinda sabotaging
the restaurant.

10:03.376 --> 10:05.109
All the pasta's handmade.

10:05.109 --> 10:07.476
That's a big positive.
All the pasta's handmade?

10:07.476 --> 10:08.576
Yeah, all handmade.

10:08.576 --> 10:09.609
That's incredible.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.743
Let's start off

10:11.743 --> 10:13.876
with involtini di melanzane,
the eggplant.

10:13.876 --> 10:15.076
Sure.

10:15.076 --> 10:16.343
Gotta go for
the Caesar salad tableside.

10:16.343 --> 10:17.909
Love that idea.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.443
And the fresh lobster ravioli.
All right.

10:19.443 --> 10:21.276
The rack of lamb.
I'll go for that as well.

10:21.276 --> 10:23.530
I want to see as much as I can
and travel across Italy.

10:23.530 --> 10:24.543
I want to see as much as I can
and travel across Italy.

10:24.543 --> 10:27.143
Yeah, brilliant.
Yeah, I hope so.

10:27.143 --> 10:28.343
How's the food?

10:29.809 --> 10:31.809
Frank can push it out

10:31.809 --> 10:34.643
when the attitude's there,
when he wants to.

10:34.643 --> 10:35.609
Uh-huh.
How old's Frank?

10:35.609 --> 10:36.709
47.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.709
47.
He looks older than that.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.176
Stress.

10:40.176 --> 10:42.043
Geez.

10:42.043 --> 10:43.376
What's he having?

10:43.376 --> 10:44.976
Some involtini.

10:44.976 --> 10:46.143
Don't talk to me.
Just write it down.

10:46.143 --> 10:47.343
All right.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.209
I don't like
talking to nobody.

10:49.209 --> 10:51.309
I'm nervous, but, like,
at the same time it's like,

10:51.309 --> 10:52.943
come on,
bring the test on.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.530
I know I can pass.

10:53.530 --> 10:54.376
I know I can pass.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.943
I'm not blowing
my own smoke up my ass,

10:55.943 --> 10:57.043
but the food is good.

10:57.043 --> 10:58.243
Okay, the Caesar.

10:58.243 --> 10:59.543
Anybody got
the Caesar going?

11:01.343 --> 11:02.743
Brilliant.

11:02.743 --> 11:04.176
Tableside Caesar on
the North End of Boston, right?

11:04.176 --> 11:05.943
You're going right
to the very basics.

11:05.943 --> 11:07.376
You've got an egg yolk
there as well.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.509
Egg yolk, garlic,
anchovies.

11:09.509 --> 11:11.642
Wow.

11:11.642 --> 11:12.742
Who woulda ever thought
I'd be making a Caesar

11:12.742 --> 11:16.242
for Gordon Ramsay?

11:19.409 --> 11:20.609
I love doing
the Caesar salad.

11:20.609 --> 11:22.742
So I put a lot
of enthusiasm into it.

11:32.409 --> 11:34.942
Okay, great.
Thank you.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.942
Have you just washed
that salad?

11:42.942 --> 11:43.975
Yes.

11:43.975 --> 11:45.075
You just washed it then?
Yep.

11:45.075 --> 11:47.909
'Cause it's soaking wet.

11:47.909 --> 11:49.575
So all the dressing's
just run off it

11:49.575 --> 11:51.075
'cause the lettuce
is soaking wet.

11:51.075 --> 11:52.442
To dress a Caesar salad,

11:52.442 --> 11:53.530
the salad has to be crisp
but dry.

11:53.530 --> 11:54.442
the salad has to be crisp
but dry.

11:54.442 --> 11:57.709
So you've made all that
fricking work for nothing.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.809
Oh, my God.

11:59.809 --> 12:02.009
Eight minutes for nothing.

12:04.209 --> 12:06.075
Kim, you think he's gonna
like the food.

12:06.075 --> 12:07.575
I think so.

12:07.575 --> 12:09.542
Frank is so defeated
right now

12:09.542 --> 12:13.075
that he's lost the confidence
in himself as a chef

12:13.075 --> 12:15.375
and in his abilities.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.709
The eggplant is in the window.
Wanna get Andrew?

12:20.842 --> 12:21.975
The addiction,
what was it?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.275
Painkillers.
Painkillers?

12:23.275 --> 12:23.530
Yeah.

12:23.530 --> 12:25.542
Yeah.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.509
Heroin?

12:33.609 --> 12:35.409
How long did you
spend inside?

12:35.409 --> 12:37.409
Almost four years.

12:37.409 --> 12:38.509
And you've been clean
for how long now?

12:38.509 --> 12:39.975
Almost two years.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.175
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

12:41.175 --> 12:42.175
Two years clean.

12:42.175 --> 12:43.209
Brilliant.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.275
Yeah, it's nice.

12:45.275 --> 12:47.175
And here we have
the eggplant,

12:47.175 --> 12:49.042
involtini di melanzane.

12:49.042 --> 12:50.442
Thank you.

12:50.442 --> 12:52.142
Eh.

12:52.142 --> 12:53.530
Strange.

12:53.530 --> 12:54.242
Strange.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.008
Really soggy.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.408
Hasn't been fried
or cooked long enough.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.708
Yeah.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.175
It's really spongy
and horrible.

13:06.175 --> 13:07.508
Are they frozen?

13:07.508 --> 13:08.575
No, no, that's fresh.

13:08.575 --> 13:09.708
When were they done?

13:09.708 --> 13:12.508
This morning.
Really?

13:12.508 --> 13:13.808
Will you just check
if that was done this morning?

13:13.808 --> 13:15.042
'Cause it tastes like
it was done last week.

13:15.042 --> 13:16.475
Sure.

13:16.475 --> 13:17.808
Thank you.
Frank.

13:17.808 --> 13:19.508
What?
Said this was spongy.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.042
What was?

13:22.042 --> 13:23.530
When were they cooked?
When were they made?

13:23.530 --> 13:24.275
When were they cooked?
When were they made?

13:24.275 --> 13:26.175
Uh...
He asked me
if they were frozen.

13:26.175 --> 13:28.208
I said,
"No, they're not."

13:33.042 --> 13:35.008
I'll go tell him.

13:35.008 --> 13:37.608
I can't make eggplant to order.
That's impossible.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.475
I don't have the time.

13:40.842 --> 13:42.342
Unless he has a new method
that I don't know about.

13:46.442 --> 13:47.976
That's what
the method is, Frank.

13:47.976 --> 13:50.476
It's impossible to be here
at 11:00 in the morning.

13:50.476 --> 13:52.976
Eh, Frank.

13:55.576 --> 13:57.842
He doesn't even fry
the eggplant anymore.

13:59.976 --> 14:01.642
Ridiculous.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.509
Eggplant?
Made yesterday?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.976
It was actually made
three weeks ago.

14:07.509 --> 14:08.809
Three weeks ago?

14:08.809 --> 14:10.242
Yeah.

14:10.242 --> 14:11.742
That's disgusting.

14:11.742 --> 14:14.876
Do you go grocery shopping
three weeks in advance

14:14.876 --> 14:16.442
before you're gonna
eat the stuff?

14:16.442 --> 14:18.642
No.

14:18.642 --> 14:20.209
All right, give me a pen.
I need to keep score.

14:20.209 --> 14:22.109
It's one down.

14:22.109 --> 14:23.276
One eggplant
not good.

14:23.276 --> 14:23.530
Lobster ravioli,
that should be fine.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.842
Lobster ravioli,
that should be fine.

14:26.842 --> 14:27.976
What's next?

14:27.976 --> 14:30.009
Lobster ravioli.

14:30.009 --> 14:31.742
And were these
made yesterday?

14:33.609 --> 14:35.576
I'll make sure I get
a date on that.

14:38.242 --> 14:40.576
What is that?

14:40.576 --> 14:43.076
It's like a goo.

14:43.076 --> 14:44.876
When were the lobster
ravioli made?

14:44.876 --> 14:46.576
I do not know.
The manufacturer does that.

14:46.576 --> 14:48.776
They are not homemade.

14:48.776 --> 14:52.576
I definitely feel dumb,
you know?

14:52.576 --> 14:53.530
Here I am telling people

14:53.530 --> 14:54.609
Here I am telling people

14:54.609 --> 14:56.576
all the pastas are handmade,

14:56.576 --> 14:58.809
'cause that's what
Frank told me.

14:58.809 --> 15:01.642
I feel betrayed
by my own boss.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.276
That's--that's not right.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.176
That's nasty.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.076
The lobster ravioli
is store-bought.

15:13.076 --> 15:14.909
So it's not fresh?
No.

15:14.909 --> 15:16.176
Hold on a minute.
Hold on.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.776
We're backtracking now.
Fresh pasta every day?

15:17.776 --> 15:19.376
All the pasta's handmade.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.509
Yeah, all handmade.

15:21.509 --> 15:23.530
I thought
they were made fresh.

15:23.530 --> 15:23.776
I thought
they were made fresh.

15:23.776 --> 15:24.842
Why would you have
the store-bought?

15:24.842 --> 15:25.942
That's gross.

15:25.942 --> 15:27.309
You can never say to Frank,

15:27.309 --> 15:28.709
"Frank, why aren't
the pastas handmade?

15:28.709 --> 15:30.342
Why don't you come in earlier
and make pastas?"

15:30.342 --> 15:32.242
I hope that you can
get through to him.

15:32.242 --> 15:34.009
'Cause he is a good chef.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.976
But is he a passionate chef?

15:36.976 --> 15:37.976
No.

15:37.976 --> 15:39.176
No.

15:39.176 --> 15:41.009
Wow.

15:41.009 --> 15:42.342
Geez.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.409
Okay, thank you,
Andrew.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.042
All right.

15:45.042 --> 15:47.676
He say he liked it
or he didn't like it?

15:47.676 --> 15:49.042
He hated
the lobster ravioli.

15:49.042 --> 15:51.842
Didn't like
the lobster.

15:51.842 --> 15:53.530
I really want
to please the guy.

15:53.530 --> 15:53.909
I really want
to please the guy.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.509
I knew he was gonna complain.

15:55.509 --> 15:59.209
I mean, come on, at least, like,
tell me if the sauce is good.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.409
I mean, that's all I ask.

16:01.409 --> 16:03.176
If he doesn't like this,
then, like, what the?

16:03.176 --> 16:05.642
I'm bussing again.

16:05.642 --> 16:07.109
He's gotta like something.

16:07.109 --> 16:08.442
Rack of lamb.
Uh-huh.

16:08.442 --> 16:10.376
Which is served in
a garlic and Rosemary crust

16:10.376 --> 16:12.409
in a barolo red wine sauce.

16:12.409 --> 16:13.509
Bon appetito.
Thank you.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.609
What kind of crust is it?

16:19.609 --> 16:20.709
Garlic and Rosemary.

16:20.709 --> 16:21.676
Mm-hmm.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.876
It's burnt.

16:22.876 --> 16:23.530
It's burnt
and bitter.

16:23.530 --> 16:24.076
It's burnt
and bitter.

16:24.076 --> 16:26.509
When garlic burns,
it goes bitter.

16:26.509 --> 16:28.076
I can't even
taste the lamb.

16:28.076 --> 16:30.676
I felt embarrassed by some
of the dishes that came out.

16:30.676 --> 16:32.376
Whoo, wow.

16:32.376 --> 16:34.209
Again, passion gone.

16:34.209 --> 16:35.642
Anthony, take me
to the kitchen, please.

16:35.642 --> 16:37.142
I'm gonna have
a word with Frank.

16:37.142 --> 16:38.676
I definitely think
we're screwed.

16:38.676 --> 16:41.009
Okay, let's start.

16:41.009 --> 16:42.509
I sat down,

16:42.509 --> 16:43.542
I got told
the pasta's fresh.

16:43.542 --> 16:45.142
I got excited.

16:45.142 --> 16:47.209
It's homemade and it's
coming from the heart.

16:47.209 --> 16:48.709
All of a sudden

16:48.709 --> 16:49.676
you got this
ravioli lobster

16:49.676 --> 16:51.976
that's store-bought.

16:51.976 --> 16:52.942
It was horrible.

16:52.942 --> 16:53.530
But how was the sauce?

16:53.530 --> 16:55.176
But how was the sauce?

16:55.176 --> 16:56.376
Who gives a
about the sauce?

16:56.376 --> 16:58.442
The filling is the magic.

16:58.442 --> 16:59.942
Whether it's a ravioli
or a tortellini,

16:59.942 --> 17:01.976
it's the filling
you get excited about.

17:01.976 --> 17:04.576
The eggplant,
that was a disaster.

17:04.576 --> 17:05.976
Spongy,

17:05.976 --> 17:07.842
bitter, undercooked.

17:07.842 --> 17:10.142
And then I got told it was
cooked three weeks ago.

17:10.142 --> 17:12.976
Embarrassing.
I mean, really embarrassing.

17:12.976 --> 17:14.309
You can't make fresh food

17:14.309 --> 17:16.076
and freeze it
and charge money

17:16.076 --> 17:18.076
to run a  business.

17:18.076 --> 17:20.076
If you can't even be bothered
to cook fresh food,

17:20.076 --> 17:21.976
what do you want me to do?

17:21.976 --> 17:23.530
Wave a magic wand
and turn this place around?

17:23.530 --> 17:24.242
Wave a magic wand
and turn this place around?

17:24.242 --> 17:25.376
Come on!

17:25.376 --> 17:26.976
This is what I do.

17:26.976 --> 17:28.176
I don't know
how to do any better.

17:28.176 --> 17:29.176
That's a lie.

17:29.176 --> 17:30.176
You could do much better.

17:30.176 --> 17:31.876
Do you want to do better?

17:34.209 --> 17:35.509
That's the big question.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.942
I'm gonna get
some fresh air.

17:40.942 --> 17:43.776
I'll be back later, yeah?

17:43.776 --> 17:44.876
Unbelievable.

17:44.876 --> 17:46.609
In the 13 years
I've been here,

17:46.609 --> 17:48.209
Chef Ramsay tasting the menu
was, like,

17:48.209 --> 17:49.976
the worst experience
I've ever had.

17:49.976 --> 17:51.909
hell.

17:51.909 --> 17:53.530
At least tell me the sauce
is half decent.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.042
At least tell me the sauce
is half decent.

17:54.042 --> 17:56.009
You can't be begging
for a compliment, Frank.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.042
I'm not begging
for a compliment.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.242
But you were at the end.

18:00.609 --> 18:01.742
Frankie thinks
he knows everything.

18:01.742 --> 18:03.242
He's not gonna
hear it from anyone.

18:03.242 --> 18:04.909
You need help.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.642
He may say,
"Ramsay too."

18:06.642 --> 18:08.142
I don't know.

18:08.142 --> 18:10.576
It comes down to us being here
or not being here, Frank.

18:10.576 --> 18:11.576
You know it.
I know it.

18:11.576 --> 18:13.142
It's not news.

18:13.142 --> 18:15.076
You have someone here
willing to help you.

18:15.076 --> 18:16.576
Do you want
to learn from him?

18:16.576 --> 18:18.076
Dead seriously,
dead seriously.

18:18.076 --> 18:19.776
I don't know.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.842
Well, you have to make
a decision today.

18:33.388 --> 18:36.388
Upset after Chef Ramsay's
harsh critique of his dishes...

18:36.388 --> 18:37.421
Do you wanna do this?

18:37.421 --> 18:39.288
I don't know.

18:39.288 --> 18:41.388
Frank is not only questioning
the future of Davide,

18:41.388 --> 18:42.688
But his own.

18:44.554 --> 18:45.988
Mentally when I'm out

18:45.988 --> 18:48.188
the restaurant
is a total frustration

18:48.188 --> 18:50.554
'cause there's too many
bad old memories.

18:53.021 --> 18:55.154
Where's Frank?
Okay, there.

18:55.154 --> 18:57.454
What do you got down there,
a little booth?

18:57.454 --> 18:59.675
I'm thinking.
Come on!

18:59.675 --> 18:59.754
I'm thinking.
Come on!

18:59.754 --> 19:02.688
You need to sit down
on your ass to think?

19:02.688 --> 19:03.788
My seat of depression.

19:06.921 --> 19:09.788
Your boss represents
the company.

19:09.788 --> 19:12.488
If you see a boss slacking off,
what's that tell you?

19:12.488 --> 19:15.021
I mean, he doesn't even
dress up in a chef's jacket.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.954
Who am I
busting my ass for?

19:16.954 --> 19:19.754
With seemingly the weight
of the world on his shoulders,

19:19.754 --> 19:22.154
Frank is about to face
a busy night,

19:22.154 --> 19:25.388
as word has leaked out
that Chef Ramsay is at Davide.

19:25.388 --> 19:27.121
Welcome to Davide.

19:27.121 --> 19:29.388
Okay.

19:29.388 --> 19:29.675
And I'll have the veal chop.

19:29.675 --> 19:31.154
And I'll have the veal chop.

19:31.154 --> 19:32.354
Okay, order's in.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.554
But back in the kitchen...

19:33.554 --> 19:36.321
Frank, come on.

19:36.321 --> 19:38.821
It appears as though
Frank has given up

19:38.821 --> 19:40.488
Before dinner
has even started.

19:40.488 --> 19:41.621
Frank, come on,
come on, come on.

19:41.621 --> 19:43.754
Come on.

19:43.754 --> 19:46.554
The only reason why I don't
quit is because I'm too proud.

19:46.554 --> 19:47.721
Let's go.

19:47.721 --> 19:49.921
One salmon, one tag,
one shrimp Alfredo.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.588
Enjoy your dinner.

19:51.588 --> 19:52.754
As orders continue
to pile into the kitchen...

19:52.754 --> 19:54.821
I'm waiting on a duck
and a salmon.

19:54.821 --> 19:55.854
I got the duck right here.

19:55.854 --> 19:57.854
Can I call table 20,
please?

19:57.854 --> 19:59.454
Table 20.

19:59.454 --> 19:59.675
A depressed Frank tries
to get motivated.

19:59.675 --> 20:00.954
A depressed Frank tries
to get motivated.

20:00.954 --> 20:02.588
What's up on table ten's app?
Three eggplant, three fag.

20:05.488 --> 20:07.588
But it's not long before
the kitchen is backed up.

20:10.621 --> 20:12.254
They are coming out.
They are coming out.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.721
The kitchen's
a little bit behind.

20:14.721 --> 20:17.021
I need two fettuccine
bolognese on the fly.

20:17.021 --> 20:18.554
Hey, Anthony!

20:18.554 --> 20:19.988
Slow it the  down.

20:19.988 --> 20:21.288
What do you think
I'm doing?

20:24.388 --> 20:25.888
My brother,
I hate his attitude.

20:25.888 --> 20:27.488
I hate working with him,

20:27.488 --> 20:29.021
'cause, like, I can't
tell Frank anything

20:29.021 --> 20:29.675
without him telling me
to go  myself.

20:29.675 --> 20:30.821
without him telling me
to go  myself.

20:30.821 --> 20:32.554
Table 31's
been waiting an hour.

20:32.554 --> 20:34.054
Please shut the  up!

20:35.888 --> 20:37.221
Talk to each other.

20:37.221 --> 20:38.688
If you guys say nothing,

20:38.688 --> 20:39.921
it's just like the blind
leading the blind.

20:39.921 --> 20:41.888
I think Ramsay,
it's great,

20:41.888 --> 20:44.254
because it's like he's the only
one he's gonna listen to.

20:44.254 --> 20:46.921
Table ten.
It's out there!

20:46.921 --> 20:48.288
If he listens to him.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.688
I'm waiting on 32.

20:49.688 --> 20:50.854
I can't cook that fast.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.621
Rush, rush, rush.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.254
What the  is it
with this society?

20:57.254 --> 20:58.888
I need two bolognese.

20:58.888 --> 20:59.675
All right, I'm behind.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.388
All right, I'm behind.

21:00.388 --> 21:03.321
Eddie, they're gonna
send this back.

21:03.321 --> 21:04.788
Start cooking another one

21:04.788 --> 21:07.254
because they're gonna
send it back.

21:07.254 --> 21:08.988
This goes to table five.
Do it now.

21:08.988 --> 21:10.954
The fish was bad.

21:10.954 --> 21:12.654
That was like,
"Aw, , let it roll."

21:12.654 --> 21:13.888
I took a gamble.

21:13.888 --> 21:15.188
I mean, it doesn't
look pretty,

21:15.188 --> 21:16.454
but if they like it,
they like it.

21:16.454 --> 21:17.888
If not...

21:17.888 --> 21:20.254
I'm sorry,
this was really dry.

21:20.254 --> 21:21.454
That would be great.

21:23.888 --> 21:25.221
I got salmon on the fly.

21:25.221 --> 21:27.421
Table five, too dry.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.021
What did I tell you?

21:32.021 --> 21:34.254
Frank, you knew
that was coming back?

21:34.254 --> 21:35.654
Why did you send it?

21:35.654 --> 21:37.621
'Cause I'm gonna get
a complaint either way.

21:37.621 --> 21:39.654
They're gonna wait too long,
or they're gonna send it back.

21:39.654 --> 21:42.421
I'd rather they wait
and have it perfect

21:42.421 --> 21:44.321
then wait and send
to come back.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.821
How sad is that?

21:47.821 --> 21:49.454
Ahh!

21:51.654 --> 21:53.121
When a chef doesn't care,

21:53.121 --> 21:54.988
that means the restaurant
goes downhill rapidly.

21:54.988 --> 21:57.121
And that's exactly
what's happening tonight.

21:57.121 --> 21:59.254
I think Frank
is way too burnt out.

21:59.254 --> 21:59.675
Right now it's more
depressing than anything.

21:59.675 --> 22:02.121
Right now it's more
depressing than anything.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.121
Unbelievable.

22:04.121 --> 22:07.554
It's an hour and a half
into dinner service...

22:07.554 --> 22:09.621
Table 20 and table 3,
that's what I'm putting up.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.088
And food is slowly making its
way out to the diners.

22:13.754 --> 22:16.821
But unfortunately
it's not worth the wait.

22:16.821 --> 22:18.121
Ugh.

22:21.921 --> 22:24.454
Frank, this is lukewarm.

22:24.454 --> 22:26.921
That son of a  bitch!

22:26.921 --> 22:29.021
You and your  lemon juice
stupid chicken

22:29.021 --> 22:29.675
Artichoke.

22:29.675 --> 22:30.688
Artichoke.

22:30.688 --> 22:32.254
Pardon me.

22:32.254 --> 22:33.854
Oh, now what?

22:33.854 --> 22:36.054
He says it's overdone.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.388
Shut the  up.

22:38.388 --> 22:40.154
This is the way it is.
Don't come back with it.

22:41.188 --> 22:43.321
This is it.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.888
This is the breaking point
of this restaurant right here.

22:45.888 --> 22:47.221
The food sucks anyway.

22:47.221 --> 22:49.954
I'm putting up.

22:49.954 --> 22:51.288
Frank needs
to make a commitment

22:51.288 --> 22:52.621
to working hard.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.021
And if you don't
have that passion,

22:54.021 --> 22:55.888
you don't have it,
and you gotta get outta here.

22:55.888 --> 22:58.254
Any more  slips
coming in?

22:58.254 --> 22:59.675
Frank, we're screwed.

22:59.675 --> 22:59.921
Frank, we're screwed.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.588
I'm not  cooking.
I'm not doing it.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.321
I'm  done.

23:13.644 --> 23:14.844
So what,
you don't like it?

23:14.844 --> 23:16.344
This is lukewarm.
Too dry.

23:16.344 --> 23:18.177
He says it's overdone.

23:18.177 --> 23:21.611
It may only be halfway
into dinner service...

23:21.611 --> 23:23.311
Frank, we're screwed.

23:23.311 --> 23:25.011
I'm not  cooking.
I'm not doing it.

23:25.011 --> 23:26.777
But owner Frank
has had enough.

23:33.644 --> 23:36.211
Might not go back in tonight.

23:36.211 --> 23:38.211
I've definitely lost
the passion for cooking

23:38.211 --> 23:40.177
or for being in the restaurant
business period.

23:40.177 --> 23:40.222
I don't know
what to do anymore.

23:40.222 --> 23:43.244
I don't know
what to do anymore.

23:43.244 --> 23:46.311
With Frank abandoning
the kitchen,

23:46.311 --> 23:48.311
sous-chef Eddie
and the rest of the staff

23:48.311 --> 23:50.144
finish off
a painful dinner service.

23:50.144 --> 23:52.311
Chicken.

23:52.311 --> 23:53.611
Sorry about that.

23:53.611 --> 23:55.444
Folks, thank you very much.
Have a good night.

24:02.377 --> 24:03.644
Tonight I saw something

24:03.644 --> 24:05.677
quite frightening.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.344
It wasn't about food,

24:07.344 --> 24:08.744
it wasn't the complaints,

24:08.744 --> 24:10.222
and it certainly
wasn't the service.

24:10.222 --> 24:11.411
and it certainly
wasn't the service.

24:11.411 --> 24:12.644
It was Frank.

24:14.177 --> 24:15.977
And here's why.

24:15.977 --> 24:19.844
Watching him,
he is so burnt out,

24:19.844 --> 24:21.311
he's given up.

24:21.311 --> 24:23.544
It's like
a ticking time bomb

24:23.544 --> 24:27.044
that's about to explode.

24:27.044 --> 24:30.544
I know.

24:30.544 --> 24:31.977
I love him.

24:31.977 --> 24:33.977
And I've seen how much
over the years

24:33.977 --> 24:35.311
he's done for everyone.

24:37.444 --> 24:39.744
And he feels so defeated.

24:39.744 --> 24:40.222
I can see it.

24:40.222 --> 24:40.844
I can see it.

24:42.744 --> 24:44.777
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

24:44.777 --> 24:46.511
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:46.511 --> 24:47.711
I don't want to see you
like this.

24:47.711 --> 24:49.744
Hey, hey, I can see it.

24:49.744 --> 24:52.644
That's why we called you,
'cause we wanna help.

24:52.644 --> 24:54.211
This is not about a guy

24:54.211 --> 24:55.711
that can't
be bothered to cook.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.544
He is done.
He's on the floor.

24:58.544 --> 24:59.844
I know.

24:59.844 --> 25:02.344
And he's barely breathing.

25:02.344 --> 25:03.944
What do we do?

25:03.944 --> 25:05.844
We start by bringing him back.

25:05.844 --> 25:09.411
Tonight take
ten minutes out

25:09.411 --> 25:10.222
and think of something
you've never said to him before

25:10.222 --> 25:11.544
and think of something
you've never said to him before

25:11.544 --> 25:14.377
that can help
to inspire him.

25:14.377 --> 25:16.711
Do you understand?
Yes.

25:16.711 --> 25:17.944
Good night.

25:17.944 --> 25:18.777
Good night.
Thank you very much.

25:18.777 --> 25:20.911
Frank could stop anybody.

25:20.911 --> 25:22.177
He's got a good heart.

25:22.177 --> 25:23.844
I think he thinks
I'm against him.

25:23.844 --> 25:25.144
It's really not like that.

25:25.144 --> 25:27.677
You know,
it's my brother.

25:27.677 --> 25:31.011
I love him.

25:31.011 --> 25:33.144
But if we can't
work together,

25:33.144 --> 25:36.577
without a doubt
we will close the doors.

25:43.411 --> 25:46.111
Frank has clearly
lost his passion.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.411
Morning.

25:47.411 --> 25:49.244
And unfortunately his family

25:49.244 --> 25:51.577
And his business are being
dragged down with him.

25:51.577 --> 25:53.611
Let's sit down.

25:53.611 --> 25:55.844
Chef Ramsay knows
that if this restaurant

25:55.844 --> 25:58.144
has any chance of surviving

25:58.144 --> 26:00.144
he must find a way
to inspire Frank.

26:00.144 --> 26:01.244
Take a seat.

26:01.244 --> 26:03.377
When I watched you
last night,

26:03.377 --> 26:05.777
from start to finish
it upset me,

26:05.777 --> 26:06.944
and here's why.

26:06.944 --> 26:10.222
I witnessed
a broken man.

26:10.222 --> 26:10.611
I witnessed
a broken man.

26:10.611 --> 26:14.611
I could see all the stress
has killed your spirit.

26:14.611 --> 26:16.777
I spoke to Kim and Anthony
late last night,

26:16.777 --> 26:19.611
and they both just want
to say something

26:19.611 --> 26:21.044
to you personally.

26:21.044 --> 26:23.177
Anthony.
I wrote it down.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.277
Frank, we both know we're
not good at this stuff.

26:28.277 --> 26:30.444
So...

26:30.444 --> 26:32.877
All right.

26:32.877 --> 26:35.044
"Frank, I think you have been
so overwhelmed for so long

26:35.044 --> 26:38.311
"and for good reason.

26:38.311 --> 26:40.222
I know how much damage
I've done."

26:40.222 --> 26:41.711
I know how much damage
I've done."

26:47.377 --> 26:48.611
You can do it.
it's okay.

26:48.611 --> 26:49.877
Big, deep breath.
Come on.

26:49.877 --> 26:51.877
It's all right.

26:54.377 --> 26:56.944
"And you had
to hold it together.

26:56.944 --> 27:00.244
"Now I believe you need
to take care of yourself.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.444
"You and I both know that
you have it in you

27:01.444 --> 27:03.711
"to get back into life.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.277
"No matter what
we say to each other,

27:05.277 --> 27:07.511
"you know if it comes down
to it I'm always there.

27:07.511 --> 27:10.044
"I think we lost sight
of what really counts.

27:10.044 --> 27:10.222
"I believe we can really
make this place work,

27:10.222 --> 27:12.377
"I believe we can really
make this place work,

27:12.377 --> 27:14.111
"and you know that we can

27:14.111 --> 27:15.711
"if we put
the effort into it.

27:15.711 --> 27:18.077
We don't ever say it,
but I do love you."

27:18.077 --> 27:19.077
That's it.

27:22.544 --> 27:24.011
My brother's never--

27:24.011 --> 27:25.844
that's the first time I heard
any remorse from him,

27:25.844 --> 27:28.244
legitimate remorse.

27:28.244 --> 27:31.144
Should I listen
or should I not listen?

27:31.144 --> 27:32.977
I don't know.

27:32.977 --> 27:34.477
Kim?

27:34.477 --> 27:38.011
To say I love you
is an understatement.

27:38.011 --> 27:40.222
And to say that
I'm always beside you,

27:40.222 --> 27:42.044
And to say that
I'm always beside you,

27:42.044 --> 27:44.111
I think you know that.

27:44.111 --> 27:46.577
The past 12 years have been
the hardest of our lives.

27:46.577 --> 27:49.211
But we made it through
together

27:49.211 --> 27:50.944
because we love
each other.

27:50.944 --> 27:54.244
And I look at the way
you talk to people lately

27:54.244 --> 27:58.044
and the mean things
that come out of your mouth,

27:58.044 --> 28:00.211
and I think it comes from
you holding this burden

28:00.211 --> 28:02.377
for the whole family

28:02.377 --> 28:04.544
for so long
on your shoulders.

28:06.744 --> 28:10.222
You haven't put this
chef's jacket on in four years.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.011
You haven't put this
chef's jacket on in four years.

28:11.011 --> 28:14.111
'Cause I think inside you felt
you didn't deserve it anymore.

28:14.111 --> 28:16.811
But you do.

28:16.811 --> 28:18.511
You're actually one
of the most talented people

28:18.511 --> 28:20.577
I've ever met in my life.

28:20.577 --> 28:23.544
That lack of passion that
showed in the food yesterday

28:23.544 --> 28:25.944
for Gordon
was a cry for help.

28:25.944 --> 28:28.911
You are worth it,
and you deserve success.

28:28.911 --> 28:31.077
And you've
worked hard for it.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.911
And you deserve it,
Frank.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.544
But the only way this place
is gonna make it

28:35.544 --> 28:37.877
is you have to look
within you

28:37.877 --> 28:40.222
and break down this wall
that you've built.

28:40.222 --> 28:40.944
and break down this wall
that you've built.

28:43.544 --> 28:46.744
Please,
put this back on.

28:46.744 --> 28:50.311
Now.
I'm serious.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.411
I don't deserve
to wear that jacket

28:52.411 --> 28:55.111
because a schmuck could put out
the food I was putting out.

28:55.111 --> 28:57.177
You don't wear a uniform
if you don't produce.

28:57.177 --> 28:58.211
Put it back on.

28:58.211 --> 28:59.511
Not yet.

29:13.454 --> 29:14.854
After an emotional...

29:14.854 --> 29:16.854
We don't ever say it,
but I do love you.

29:16.854 --> 29:18.854
And hopeful plea
from his family...

29:18.854 --> 29:21.320
Please put this back on.
Not yet.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.154
Chef Ramsay goes to work...

29:23.154 --> 29:24.620
I don't care
about the

29:24.620 --> 29:26.020
That's been kicked
into you years ago.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.620
You gotta cook.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.654
Trying to reignite
Frank's passion

29:28.654 --> 29:30.054
In the kitchen.

29:30.054 --> 29:32.087
I want you to think of
something that you wanna cook

29:32.087 --> 29:33.687
and put the passion
on the plate,

29:33.687 --> 29:34.887
not the anger.

29:34.887 --> 29:35.887
Ramsey didn't like
a freakin' thing

29:35.887 --> 29:37.154
that I made yesterday.

29:37.154 --> 29:39.187
I don't know what to do
to please the guy.

29:39.187 --> 29:39.781
What are you thinking
of doing?

29:39.781 --> 29:40.420
What are you thinking
of doing?

29:40.420 --> 29:42.287
God, it's a total blank.

29:42.287 --> 29:43.920
I hope he thinks
it's good.

29:47.387 --> 29:48.654
Nice.

29:48.654 --> 29:49.887
I like to see your mind working,
you know that?

29:49.887 --> 29:51.620
It means your passion's
coming back.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.787
Frankie has the talent
to put out that kinda food.

29:55.787 --> 29:58.087
If he gets dedicated,
it could be done.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.354
If not, it's over.

29:59.354 --> 30:00.620
What have you got
in the sauce?

30:00.620 --> 30:03.954
Shallots, thyme,
a little dash of rosemary.

30:03.954 --> 30:05.487
No good?

30:05.487 --> 30:07.254
It's delicious!

30:07.254 --> 30:08.520
You're always
on the defensive.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.781
Who said no good?

30:09.781 --> 30:09.787
Who said no good?

30:09.787 --> 30:12.220
You ripped me
a new  out there.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.920
If I got served that
yesterday as my entree,

30:13.920 --> 30:15.020
I'd be like
a pig in.

30:15.954 --> 30:17.287
He liked it.

30:17.287 --> 30:19.187
Cooking with Chef Ramsay
made me feel like

30:19.187 --> 30:20.754
I was cooking
in the old days,

30:20.754 --> 30:22.687
the way I had passion
about doing things.

30:22.687 --> 30:25.220
Absolutely delicious.
Thank you.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.420
Now that Frank's spirit
has been lifted,

30:27.420 --> 30:29.220
Chef Ramsay
decides to go ahead

30:29.220 --> 30:31.020
with phase two
of his plan,

30:31.020 --> 30:34.354
giving a face-lift to
the tired decor of Davide.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.320
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

30:38.320 --> 30:39.354
Frank, how are you?

30:39.354 --> 30:39.781
Uh, too nervous.

30:39.781 --> 30:41.254
Uh, too nervous.

30:41.254 --> 30:43.354
Great.

30:43.354 --> 30:44.520
Let's go.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.687
Come in, come in, come in.

30:46.687 --> 30:48.054
Oh, my God.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.287
Look at this.

30:50.287 --> 30:52.787
Oh, my God, Frank.

30:52.787 --> 30:54.854
Oh, it's beautiful.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.287
Welcome to the new Davide.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.220
Right, where should
we start?

30:58.220 --> 31:00.520
A new, modern appeal.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.287
Gone are
the old dreadful chairs.

31:03.287 --> 31:08.320
We've replaced them with
stunning, new mahogany chairs.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.587
Beautiful.

31:09.587 --> 31:09.781
Okay, take a look
at this.

31:09.781 --> 31:10.887
Okay, take a look
at this.

31:10.887 --> 31:12.154
That is awesome.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.587
By replacing those
dreadful white walls

31:13.587 --> 31:16.154
above the stone, we've
contemporized the dining room.

31:16.154 --> 31:17.854
Now we've got
textured material.

31:17.854 --> 31:19.287
It's lit underneath.

31:19.287 --> 31:21.687
It is gonna look
absolutely beautiful.

31:21.687 --> 31:23.020
And what about
the Davide sconces?

31:23.020 --> 31:24.754
Aren't they beautiful?

31:24.754 --> 31:26.387
They are
absolutely gorgeous.

31:26.387 --> 31:28.820
Have a look
at these booths.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.220
You know, we swapped
the banquettes

31:31.220 --> 31:33.554
for the booths.

31:33.554 --> 31:36.420
This is now a fresh,
modern vibe.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.020
It's absolutely beautiful.

31:38.020 --> 31:38.987
Bella, Bella,
Bella, Bella.

31:38.987 --> 31:39.781
Everything is perfect,
Gordon.

31:39.781 --> 31:40.620
Everything is perfect,
Gordon.

31:40.620 --> 31:41.720
We couldn't have asked

31:41.720 --> 31:42.787
for anything more.

31:42.787 --> 31:43.854
These were things

31:43.854 --> 31:45.487
that we were
never able to do

31:45.487 --> 31:48.020
because we were so far
down in debt.

31:48.020 --> 31:51.154
I'm so happy.

31:51.154 --> 31:53.320
And to see Frank cry,

31:53.320 --> 31:55.687
it's overwhelming.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.320
Been down here in this grave
for 27 years.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.954
Now it's like totally
everything is different

32:03.954 --> 32:05.620
and modernized.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.854
I could feel it,
that the hope is coming back.

32:09.987 --> 32:11.887
Frankie, can I just
say something?

32:11.887 --> 32:14.187
Kim, please put that away.

32:14.187 --> 32:16.587
Frankie, please, you need
to wear a chef's coat,

32:16.587 --> 32:17.887
'cause you're a chef.

32:17.887 --> 32:20.520
Take this off and please,
please, for me.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.387
You're a chef.
You're really here.

32:24.387 --> 32:26.520
It's the first time I've
worn a jacket in four years.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.787
I didn't want people to know
I was the head chef back here.

32:30.654 --> 32:32.620
It's a symbol
of that you are back.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.781
Am I the right way?

32:39.781 --> 32:39.954
Am I the right way?

32:39.954 --> 32:42.254
To see him put on the coat,

32:42.254 --> 32:46.354
to me meant that, yes,
I'm taking this all seriously,

32:46.354 --> 32:51.020
and it's--it just means
a lot to me.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.320
And now you look like
the chef that you are.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.620
'Cause you can do it.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.954
It was a touching sentiment
from my wife.

32:57.954 --> 33:01.254
But the jacket
doesn't make the person.

33:01.254 --> 33:02.787
It gives you a way
to go there,

33:02.787 --> 33:04.787
but it doesn't
make the person.

33:04.787 --> 33:07.854
Now that Frank appears ready
to command the kitchen,

33:07.854 --> 33:09.781
It's time for the final phase
of Chef Ramsay's plan:

33:09.781 --> 33:10.587
It's time for the final phase
of Chef Ramsay's plan:

33:10.587 --> 33:11.787
the menu.

33:11.787 --> 33:13.854
Have a look at this.

33:13.854 --> 33:15.720
Wow.
Oh, my God.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.320
The future of Davide

33:18.320 --> 33:20.920
is right in front
of your eyes on the table.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.520
It looks so nice.

33:22.520 --> 33:26.287
Gone are the dreadful plates
of the '80s.

33:28.154 --> 33:30.754
The appetizers, bruschetta,
roasted peppers,

33:30.754 --> 33:33.254
with caper berries,
marinated baby tomatoes.

33:33.254 --> 33:34.620
Burrata.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.687
How could we be
a modern Italian restaurant

33:36.687 --> 33:38.353
without any burrata?

33:38.353 --> 33:39.781
Then the piece de resistance,
the main course.

33:39.781 --> 33:41.487
Then the piece de resistance,
the main course.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.687
Homemade gnocchi,
brown butter,

33:43.687 --> 33:46.220
truffle oil, and some
fresh chives at the end.

33:46.220 --> 33:49.753
Homemade--stress that
every time, homemade, yeah?

33:49.753 --> 33:51.653
Pork tenderloin.

33:51.653 --> 33:53.587
Frank, your chicken.
Lemon chicken.

33:53.587 --> 33:55.087
Put an onion compote
on there as well.

33:55.087 --> 33:56.487
Tonight we relaunch

33:56.487 --> 33:58.987
the modern Davide.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.753
Dig in.

34:00.753 --> 34:03.820
There's no one in the North End
that does this new menu.

34:03.820 --> 34:05.753
Awesome.
I am overwhelmed.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.787
This is a kick-ass menu.

34:07.787 --> 34:09.653
Oh, my God.
That's delicious.

34:09.653 --> 34:09.781
Gordon put his touch,
changed the whole menu

34:09.781 --> 34:12.553
Gordon put his touch,
changed the whole menu

34:12.553 --> 34:14.920
into what it needs to be
for this type of a city

34:14.920 --> 34:17.287
with this many restaurants,
and that's what's gonna

34:17.287 --> 34:18.720
set us apart
from all the others.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.087
The chicken,
I like it too.

34:22.287 --> 34:24.020
Mangi, mangi,
taste it,mangi.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.087
It's only an hour
before dinner service...

34:27.087 --> 34:28.953
Take a seat
in there, bud.

34:28.953 --> 34:33.120
And Chef Ramsay has one more
important message for Frank.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.620
Anthony's never gonna be
perfect in your eyes.

34:35.620 --> 34:39.781
But for a recovering addict
to be clean for two years--

34:39.781 --> 34:40.287
But for a recovering addict
to be clean for two years--

34:40.287 --> 34:41.920
it's good.
it's not bad.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.720
I wish my brother was clean.

34:43.720 --> 34:45.887
I wish he had
kicked his habit.

34:45.887 --> 34:47.887
They're a similar age.

34:47.887 --> 34:49.753
And the crap

34:49.753 --> 34:52.353
that we go through
on a daily basis

34:52.353 --> 34:54.053
is just extraordinary.

34:54.053 --> 34:56.220
But cut him some slack

34:56.220 --> 34:58.553
and get him
by your side.

34:58.553 --> 35:00.920
Help him,
'cause I think

35:00.920 --> 35:02.520
when you start
helping him,

35:02.520 --> 35:04.520
he's gonna come back
ten times over.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.453
I will.

35:06.453 --> 35:09.087
Yeah?
Yeah.

35:09.087 --> 35:09.781
Maybe I've been
too tough with Anthony.

35:09.781 --> 35:10.720
Maybe I've been
too tough with Anthony.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.353
Me and Anthony
have to work together

35:12.353 --> 35:13.520
to turn
the restaurant around.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.853
Yeah, of course
it's gonna be hard.

35:14.853 --> 35:16.120
It's not gonna be easy.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.187
No, nothing ever is
if you want it.

35:18.187 --> 35:19.153
You can do it.

35:19.153 --> 35:20.187
I know you can do it.

35:20.187 --> 35:21.453
I won't let you down.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.420
He got my passion back.

35:23.420 --> 35:26.620
It's so amazing
that this is coming out.

35:31.353 --> 35:33.220
It's relaunch night
at Davide.

35:33.220 --> 35:35.253
Okay, it's showtime, guys.

35:35.253 --> 35:37.687
And Frank is already
feeling the pressure.

35:37.687 --> 35:39.781
Holy Mary,
mother of God.

35:39.781 --> 35:39.820
Holy Mary,
mother of God.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.453
I never felt
this nervous before.

35:42.453 --> 35:44.620
I don't wanna
disappoint anybody.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.853
And I wanna prove it
to myself that I can do it.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.987
But Chef Ramsay has some
important information

35:48.987 --> 35:52.220
That is going to make
the evening even more intense.

35:52.220 --> 35:54.320
I've just had a call.
Listen to me, yeah?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.320
Tonight you've got
the Boston Magazine

35:56.320 --> 35:58.820
coming in as well.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.520
Tonight the stakes were
raised from the beginning.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.687
So eyes wide open, yeah?

36:02.687 --> 36:04.987
And now it's gonna be
Boston magazine

36:04.987 --> 36:06.420
in the restaurant,

36:06.420 --> 36:08.787
and that's a big deal.
I'm ready to go.

36:08.787 --> 36:09.781
Buona sera.
Welcome to Davide.

36:09.781 --> 36:10.787
Buona sera.
Welcome to Davide.

36:10.787 --> 36:14.187
Tonight we change
the menu.

36:14.187 --> 36:15.753
We're gonna order a bunch
of different appetizers.

36:15.753 --> 36:17.587
Right this way, please.
Thank you.

36:17.587 --> 36:19.553
Take the shrimp pizzetta.

36:19.553 --> 36:20.887
I'll do the Tuscan red soup.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.687
With the restaurant packed...

36:22.687 --> 36:23.753
Boston magazine
has just arrived.

36:23.753 --> 36:25.820
What table they on?
15.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.120
Let's do it.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.420
The first tickets are in,

36:28.420 --> 36:30.653
And Frank is about to face
his first big test.

36:30.653 --> 36:33.053
All right,
five's coming up.

36:33.053 --> 36:33.953
All the tables
are high-priority.

36:33.953 --> 36:35.320
Appetizers up.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.153
That's the soup.
Pizzetta right here.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.387
But Boston Magazine,
it affects the business

36:39.387 --> 36:39.781
if they write a bad review.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.753
if they write a bad review.

36:40.753 --> 36:41.787
Ooh, that's pretty.

36:41.787 --> 36:43.720
Enjoy.

36:46.153 --> 36:47.520
This is really good.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.687
I would love the recipe.

36:48.687 --> 36:50.320
I would love
to make this at home.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.820
While the critics from
the Boston Magazine

36:51.820 --> 36:53.287
Are clearly pleased
with their appetizers...

36:53.287 --> 36:54.520
This was great.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.853
They aren't the only ones.

36:55.853 --> 36:57.387
Delicious.

36:57.387 --> 36:58.487
And for the first time
in a long time...

36:58.487 --> 37:00.053
Yeah, it's excellent.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.353
This quaint dining room

37:01.353 --> 37:03.453
In the North End of Boston
is buzzing.

37:03.453 --> 37:05.353
Frank, a new order
just came in.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.453
But back in the kitchen...

37:06.453 --> 37:07.820
Expeditor,

37:07.820 --> 37:09.781
I need entrees on table 12
immediately.

37:09.781 --> 37:10.553
I need entrees on table 12
immediately.

37:10.553 --> 37:12.320
Okay.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.720
Frank, talk to each other
a little bit, yeah?

37:13.720 --> 37:14.953
Yeah.

37:14.953 --> 37:16.320
The mood is starting to turn.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.287
And the tension is building
between the brothers.

37:18.287 --> 37:20.353
Capellini
was the second course,

37:20.353 --> 37:22.220
And I got a gnocchi
and a  right now.

37:22.220 --> 37:23.587
As Anthony pushes Frank

37:23.587 --> 37:26.687
To finish
the Boston Magazine's entrees.

37:26.687 --> 37:28.753
Keep it together, come on.
Coordinator, yes?

37:28.753 --> 37:31.153
Table 15, Frank, next course.

37:31.153 --> 37:32.387
Two ravioli, one pork.

37:32.387 --> 37:35.220
Yes, yes,
we're starting 15.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.520
It's very rare
the Boston Magazine

37:36.520 --> 37:37.887
to come out like that
at the drop of a hat.

37:37.887 --> 37:39.320
That pork is working.

37:39.320 --> 37:39.781
Frank, please, could I get
the pork so I can plate?

37:39.781 --> 37:41.653
Frank, please, could I get
the pork so I can plate?

37:41.653 --> 37:43.087
Come on, Frank,
we all ready got the other two.

37:43.087 --> 37:44.220
Give me.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.687
Listen,
don't ever rush me.

37:45.687 --> 37:47.120
I'll put it up
when it's ready.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.153
Jimmy, go.

37:48.153 --> 37:50.020
Thank you.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.687
That looks beautiful.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.187
Yeah.
Wow.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.253
Pork not good?

38:01.253 --> 38:02.487
You want it more cooked?

38:02.487 --> 38:03.653
Yeah, just, like,
pink but not red.

38:03.653 --> 38:04.820
You know, but not red.

38:06.553 --> 38:07.820
Oh, my God.

38:09.120 --> 38:09.781
Table 15
wants it cooked more.

38:09.781 --> 38:11.787
Table 15
wants it cooked more.

38:12.820 --> 38:13.920
It's the Boston Magazine.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.187
Oh, my God,
we're so.

38:16.187 --> 38:18.053
Frank, you're gonna be
the biggest  in Boston

38:18.053 --> 38:20.153
in five minutes now, yeah?
Come on!

38:20.153 --> 38:22.020
The one order that came back,
that table had to come back.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.320
This is a  disaster.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.630
It's Davide's
grand re-opening...

38:39.797 --> 38:43.064
And a critical mistake
at the Boston Magazine table...

38:43.064 --> 38:44.197
Too raw, Frank, the pork.

38:45.330 --> 38:47.697
It's the Boston Magazine.

38:47.697 --> 38:49.930
Has Frank's confidence
completely shaken.

38:49.930 --> 38:51.497
Oh, my God,
we're so.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.297
You got another one going?
What's up?

38:54.297 --> 38:55.597
Communicate.

38:55.597 --> 38:57.697
Now you want
to communicate.

38:57.697 --> 38:59.064
I let Chef Ramsay down.
I let myself down.

38:59.064 --> 39:00.564
I let everybody down.

39:00.564 --> 39:01.009
, the one order
that came back,

39:01.009 --> 39:02.364
, the one order
that came back,

39:02.364 --> 39:05.297
That table had
to come back,.

39:05.297 --> 39:07.230
That was not the table
to screw up.

39:07.230 --> 39:09.730
Listen, we can pull this back,
we can pull it back.

39:09.730 --> 39:11.664
Come on, okay?

39:11.664 --> 39:13.630
I know it's undercooked,
but we can get it going, yeah?

39:13.630 --> 39:15.064
I'm  pissed
at myself.

39:15.064 --> 39:16.497
But you can't let it
follow you.

39:16.497 --> 39:18.997
It follows,
you're destroyed.

39:18.997 --> 39:20.430
I almost went back
to the old ways,

39:20.430 --> 39:22.430
but I took a deep breath
and I was like,

39:22.430 --> 39:24.864
okay, I gotta refocus here.

39:24.864 --> 39:26.197
I'm not giving up.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.064
I'm tired,
but I'm not giving up.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.164
Pork!
Pork tenderloin!

39:28.164 --> 39:29.197
I got the pork.

39:29.197 --> 39:30.864
Here you go.

39:30.864 --> 39:31.009
Refire. That's 15.
Take it out.

39:31.009 --> 39:33.264
Refire. That's 15.
Take it out.

39:33.264 --> 39:34.630
Come back strong, yeah?
Let's go.

39:34.630 --> 39:36.464
Sorry about that.

39:36.464 --> 39:38.630
That's okay.

39:38.630 --> 39:40.130
I'm sorry.

39:40.130 --> 39:41.130
It's okay.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.264
Make sure it's good.

39:52.697 --> 39:53.797
Anthony, tell me
some tables, come on.

39:53.797 --> 39:55.564
Table 21, table 23,
pick up.

39:55.564 --> 39:57.164
If you two continue talking,

39:57.164 --> 39:58.364
We're gonna get there.

39:58.364 --> 39:59.697
Yes, sir.
Good.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.009
My relationship with Anthony
is still fractioned.

40:01.009 --> 40:02.164
My relationship with Anthony
is still fractioned.

40:02.164 --> 40:04.397
That's what's holding us back
in the restaurant.

40:04.397 --> 40:06.464
But he's been trying harder.
I see it.

40:06.464 --> 40:08.930
So I'm willing to compromise.

40:08.930 --> 40:11.297
With Anthony supporting
Frank in the kitchen...

40:11.297 --> 40:13.197
Anthony, table ten.
Nice.

40:13.197 --> 40:14.697
Come on, guys,
bring it together over there.

40:14.697 --> 40:15.797
Beautiful.

40:15.797 --> 40:17.097
Molto bene.

40:17.097 --> 40:18.797
I'd come back
just for that.

40:18.797 --> 40:20.397
The two brothers
complete dinner service

40:20.397 --> 40:21.597
On a high.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.009
Wow, what a night.

40:31.009 --> 40:32.230
Wow, what a night.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.330
Yeah, good and bad.

40:33.330 --> 40:36.397
Trust me,
mostly good.

40:36.397 --> 40:38.730
Think back to
my first day here.

40:38.730 --> 40:42.497
I saw a family in turmoil

40:42.497 --> 40:47.464
and a chef that was sitting
down in the kitchen depressed.

40:49.131 --> 40:52.564
But tonight, I saw
a family come together

40:52.564 --> 40:55.397
and pull off
a strong service.

40:55.397 --> 40:57.864
Frank, you proved
to me tonight

40:57.864 --> 41:00.031
that you can
run a kitchen.

41:02.431 --> 41:05.264
The way you handled
the pressure was phenomenal.

41:05.264 --> 41:07.431
Yes.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.664
I feel grateful
beyond words.

41:09.664 --> 41:13.331
For Frankie to hear
Gordon say that,

41:13.331 --> 41:16.431
"You can do this 100%,"

41:16.431 --> 41:17.764
it just means so much

41:17.764 --> 41:20.597
because he deserves this.

41:20.597 --> 41:22.797
We can't say thank you enough.

41:22.797 --> 41:24.931
And Frank,

41:24.931 --> 41:27.397
keep that chef's jacket on,

41:27.397 --> 41:30.097
keep that attitude with it,

41:30.097 --> 41:31.009
and never sit down
in a kitchen ever again.

41:31.009 --> 41:33.997
and never sit down
in a kitchen ever again.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.997
I'm rooting for your success.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.697
I'm real excited
for the future.

41:41.697 --> 41:44.297
My goal now
is to keep the passion going.

41:44.297 --> 41:46.797
This is a new day for Davide
and for me.

41:46.797 --> 41:48.864
Good night, guys.
Good luck, yes?

41:48.864 --> 41:50.397
Yes.
Good luck, good luck,
good luck.

41:50.397 --> 41:52.364
And more importantly,
just stay calm.

41:52.364 --> 41:54.531
That's it.
Just stay calm.

41:54.531 --> 41:57.764
Passionate man
in there with a lot to give.

41:57.764 --> 41:59.931
Okay?
Don't stop.

41:59.931 --> 42:01.009
I'll see you.

42:01.009 --> 42:01.697
I'll see you.

42:01.697 --> 42:03.397
And crack a smile
from time to time, yeah?

42:03.397 --> 42:05.697
I will.
Take care.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.897
There's no words
that could describe

42:07.897 --> 42:09.197
what I'm feeling
right now.

42:09.197 --> 42:11.197
It's overwhelming.
Totally overwhelming.

42:11.197 --> 42:12.797
Good night, chef.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.664
Good night.
Thank you.

42:16.564 --> 42:18.831
Ooh, for the last ten years

42:18.831 --> 42:20.931
Boston has seemed
to ignore Davide.

42:20.931 --> 42:24.231
But now with a huge turnaround
with the food and the staff,

42:24.231 --> 42:28.664
it's got every right
to return to its former glory.

42:28.664 --> 42:30.264
My God.

42:30.264 --> 42:31.009
People think
I've got a funny accent.

42:31.009 --> 42:32.697
People think
I've got a funny accent.

42:32.697 --> 42:34.464
Geez.

42:37.031 --> 42:38.864
In the weeks that followed,

42:38.864 --> 42:41.997
Frank's rediscovered passion
for cooking flourished.

42:41.997 --> 42:43.564
I'll take care of it.
One at a time.

42:43.564 --> 42:45.264
He's back in love with food.

42:45.264 --> 42:46.397
Hot!

42:46.397 --> 42:48.364
Wanna make myself proud,
my family proud,

42:48.364 --> 42:50.297
and Chef Ramsay proud.

42:50.297 --> 42:52.897
And the city of Boston
is reaping the benefits.

42:52.897 --> 42:54.463
Oh, it's very good.

42:54.463 --> 42:55.797
As for his brother Anthony...

42:55.797 --> 42:57.697
Thank you.
Beautiful.

42:57.697 --> 42:59.064
He too has made a comeback.

42:59.064 --> 43:01.009
Very nice
to see you, Nick.

43:01.009 --> 43:01.297
Very nice
to see you, Nick.

43:01.297 --> 43:03.164
He is clearly committed
to the restaurant.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.264
This is very good.

43:04.264 --> 43:05.497
Thank you.
Thank you.

43:05.497 --> 43:06.730
And more importantly

43:06.730 --> 43:09.592
to his brother.
