WEBVTT

00:03.251 --> 00:04.451
I just don't understand.

00:04.476 --> 00:05.676
Yeah, there's a lot of
things you don't understand.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.408
Everyone is wearing a black tie.

00:07.653 --> 00:08.920
And, you're wearing a gray tie.

00:08.954 --> 00:11.097
This is acceptable
at a black tie affair.

00:11.131 --> 00:13.630
There's nothing wrong with
the tie that I'm wearing.

00:13.664 --> 00:14.728
- Thank you--
- Yes, please.

00:14.762 --> 00:16.726
Champagne, sir?

00:16.761 --> 00:17.792
Is it?

00:17.826 --> 00:19.958
From the region?

00:19.991 --> 00:21.356
In France?

00:21.391 --> 00:23.455
Because if it's not,
it's called sparkling wine,

00:23.490 --> 00:24.857
and I don't really drink
sparkling wine.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.632
- Forget it.
- Forgive him.

00:26.666 --> 00:28.566
His parents really wanted
a girl.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.767
Never got over it.

00:29.802 --> 00:30.769
Wait a minute.
You can taste the difference.

00:30.803 --> 00:31.974
I'm not being a snob.

00:32.009 --> 00:33.041
Not a snob?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.240
You sound like Frasier's
brother.

00:34.275 --> 00:36.175
Niles Crane
was completely misunderstood.

00:36.209 --> 00:37.207
Okay, boys,
you don't want me

00:37.242 --> 00:38.207
to give you a time-out now,
do you?

00:38.242 --> 00:39.642
Look, I'd be willing
to stand

00:39.676 --> 00:41.309
in a corner if you agree
to paddle his bottom.

00:41.343 --> 00:42.743
That's hilarious.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.448
I'm just saying that if they
want us to donate

00:44.482 --> 00:46.349
to their charity,
they might as well step it up.

00:46.383 --> 00:48.520
You know, make me want
to give away my money.

00:48.555 --> 00:49.587
Your money?

00:49.621 --> 00:50.821
You're here representing
the firm, Louis.

00:50.855 --> 00:52.222
And we've always
been committed

00:52.256 --> 00:53.988
to giving back
to the community.

00:54.022 --> 00:58.391
Jessica,
is that--

00:58.425 --> 01:00.128
Tori.
Yes, and I owe her a call.

01:00.162 --> 01:02.196
Excuse me.

01:06.236 --> 01:08.537
Do I smell like sausage?

01:08.571 --> 01:11.041
No more than usual.
Why?

01:11.076 --> 01:13.643
Uh, because I'm about to meet
the future Mrs. Louis Litt.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.678
I had pizza before I came
and I just want to make sure

01:15.712 --> 01:17.014
I still am not emanating
any aroma.

01:17.048 --> 01:18.782
Oh, you're emanating
something.

01:19.554 --> 01:22.657
It's called pheromones
and women find it irresistible.

01:24.559 --> 01:28.161
Watch this.

01:31.031 --> 01:31.997
Harvey.

01:32.031 --> 01:34.832
You remember Tori?

01:34.867 --> 01:36.300
Of course.
Nice to see you.

01:36.334 --> 01:39.202
I told Jessica I don't really
want to talk shop

01:39.237 --> 01:40.804
while we're here
to support a good cause.

01:40.838 --> 01:42.974
Well, that's the beautiful
thing about a retainer.

01:43.008 --> 01:43.974
We're always on call
when you need us.

01:44.009 --> 01:46.845
So how can we help?

01:46.879 --> 01:49.881
It involves one of our most
trusted senior VPs.

01:49.915 --> 01:51.950
Something recently came
to light about his past

01:51.985 --> 01:53.719
and I'm shocked by it,
really.

01:53.753 --> 01:56.689
You tell us where it hurts
and we'll make it go away.

02:06.598 --> 02:07.732
Oh!

02:07.766 --> 02:09.633
Uh...Ooh.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.401
Wait.
Wait.

02:11.436 --> 02:12.702
- Wait?
- Yeah.

02:12.736 --> 02:14.871
Well, it's just...

02:14.905 --> 02:16.205
This feels like it's moving
really fast.

02:16.239 --> 02:17.973
I should slow down?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.574
No, I just--I mean,
like--

02:19.609 --> 02:21.910
I just got out of
a relationship and...

02:21.945 --> 02:23.479
Right.

02:23.513 --> 02:24.746
You kind of did too.

02:24.781 --> 02:26.515
I wasn't really seeing anyone.

02:26.549 --> 02:29.251
You know what I mean.

02:29.286 --> 02:30.720
Trevor.

02:30.754 --> 02:32.555
Yeah, Trevor.

02:32.589 --> 02:34.357
Right.
Trevor.

02:34.392 --> 02:36.727
Um, ahem.

02:36.761 --> 02:37.828
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

02:37.862 --> 02:39.129
We should slow down.

02:41.066 --> 02:42.200
I should make us some tea.

02:42.234 --> 02:43.201
- You want some tea?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

02:43.235 --> 02:44.202
Yeah, let's drink some tea.

02:44.236 --> 02:47.338
Thank you.

02:51.043 --> 02:54.679
What's the, uh,
Harvard Club?

02:54.714 --> 02:57.283
Oh, it's, uh--
it's, like, this clubhouse

02:57.317 --> 02:59.185
for Harvard alumni.

02:59.219 --> 03:01.620
Yeah, that invite is, uh--

03:01.655 --> 03:03.322
it's for this networking
thing for lawyers.

03:03.356 --> 03:04.556
I got it at work.

03:04.591 --> 03:06.191
Hmm, would you go?

03:06.226 --> 03:08.094
What?
Are you kidding me?

03:08.128 --> 03:09.328
No.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.997
I have a hard enough time
pretending at work.

03:11.031 --> 03:13.766
It's not like I want
to enter the lion's den.

03:16.904 --> 03:21.474
Well, if you were
gonna go...

03:21.508 --> 03:23.643
and you were gonna
take a date--

03:23.677 --> 03:26.512
It would be you.

03:26.546 --> 03:31.483
I'd love to take you.

03:31.517 --> 03:34.219
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh!

03:34.253 --> 03:35.687
Who's moving too fast now?

03:35.721 --> 03:38.989
Oh, well, that's due to saying
all the right things.

03:39.024 --> 03:42.160
Oh.

03:49.535 --> 03:50.635
Hey, what's the emergency?

03:50.670 --> 03:52.237
Couldn't find a date
to the prom?

03:52.271 --> 03:53.805
We're firing Stan Jacobson.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.007
Who?

03:55.041 --> 03:57.743
Senior Vice President,
Drybeck Accounting.

03:57.777 --> 03:59.445
- Our accounting firm?
- Yes.

03:59.479 --> 04:01.180
They're our firm
and our client.

04:01.214 --> 04:02.648
How's that possible?

04:02.650 --> 04:05.017
They signed a conflict
of interest waiver.

04:05.051 --> 04:06.251
Look at that.

04:06.286 --> 04:08.753
He's actually learning
how the law works.

04:08.788 --> 04:10.255
Acquaint yourself with
Drybeck's company charter

04:10.289 --> 04:12.323
and Stan's original
employment contract.

04:12.357 --> 04:13.758
- What'd he do?
- He lied.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.192
He lied?
About what?

04:16.228 --> 04:18.428
Wait, let me guess.
He cooked the books.

04:18.463 --> 04:19.497
God, doesn't anyone
on Wall Street

04:19.531 --> 04:21.432
put in an honest day's work
anymore?

04:21.466 --> 04:24.636
Actually, he's got
a stellar record as a Senior VP.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.337
He lied on his resume.

04:26.371 --> 04:28.440
Never got his CPA license.

04:28.474 --> 04:30.808
Never even went
to business school.

04:30.843 --> 04:32.443
He lied about
where he went to school

04:32.477 --> 04:34.179
and now he's getting fired?

04:34.213 --> 04:36.782
Drybeck does the books
for half of Wall Street.

04:36.816 --> 04:39.919
Word gets out that
a senior staff is a fraud,

04:39.953 --> 04:41.487
they're gonna start
bleeding clients.

04:41.522 --> 04:45.992
We have to do this fast
and keep it quiet.

04:46.026 --> 04:47.627
Relax.

04:47.661 --> 04:49.028
That's not gonna happen to you.

04:49.063 --> 04:52.032
But I would get fired
if Jessica found out.

04:52.066 --> 04:54.535
Found out what?

04:54.569 --> 04:56.304
Just told me he's a virgin.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.873
That doesn't surprise me
one bit.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.341
All in due time, Mike.

05:00.375 --> 05:03.411
You have those
severance quotes?

Pearson Hardman
to see Mike Ross.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.807
Uh, he expecting you?

06:02.841 --> 06:04.409
No, I just was gonna
drop this off.

06:04.443 --> 06:06.077
No appointment.
I can't let you up.

06:06.111 --> 06:08.679
Do I look like a terrorist?

06:08.713 --> 06:10.447
Do I look like I want
to lose my job?

06:10.482 --> 06:12.450
Jenny?

06:12.484 --> 06:13.818
Rachel.

06:13.852 --> 06:15.186
Hey.
You here to see Mike?

06:15.220 --> 06:16.287
Sort of.
I just--

06:16.321 --> 06:17.288
I was gonna drop this suit
off for him.

06:17.322 --> 06:18.656
Harvey called late last night,

06:18.690 --> 06:19.924
some big emergency,

06:19.958 --> 06:21.192
and Mike ended up staying
the night.

06:21.226 --> 06:22.826
Actually, could you
help me out.

06:22.861 --> 06:24.195
I'm running so late to work.

06:24.229 --> 06:25.463
Sure.

06:25.497 --> 06:26.798
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

06:26.832 --> 06:27.966
Oh.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.967
Thanks.

06:29.001 --> 06:30.468
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:30.503 --> 06:31.903
Oh!

06:31.937 --> 06:34.305
And can you tell Mike that
I left the key under the mat?

06:34.340 --> 06:35.873
Absolutely.

06:35.908 --> 06:37.274
Thank you so much, Rachel.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.444
- You're welcome.
- You're amazing.

06:53.424 --> 06:55.425
Ahem.

06:59.196 --> 07:00.530
Uh!

07:00.565 --> 07:01.531
I'm up.
I'm up.

07:01.566 --> 07:02.966
Your girlfriend stopped by.

07:03.001 --> 07:04.735
Dropped that off for you.

07:04.769 --> 07:06.036
Girlfriend?

07:06.070 --> 07:07.504
You guys move
in together already?

07:07.538 --> 07:09.105
What?
No.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.241
We--she's not my--
why do you care?

07:11.275 --> 07:12.375
I don't.
What--

07:12.410 --> 07:14.410
what was the big emergency
last night?

07:14.445 --> 07:15.979
Um, Harvey.

07:16.013 --> 07:18.181
He's firing some big vp from our
accounting firm this morning.

07:18.216 --> 07:19.749
Stan Jacobson?

07:19.784 --> 07:22.052
Yeah, why?
You know him?

07:22.086 --> 07:23.821
No, he was just checking in
at reception when I got there.

07:23.855 --> 07:25.122
What?

07:25.156 --> 07:27.258
Oh, my God!
I got to change.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.827
I will let him know
that you will be right there.

07:29.861 --> 07:33.197
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.806 --> 07:44.473
Performance numbers,
HR guidelines,

07:44.508 --> 07:46.041
severance quotes,
and Stan's in the waiting room.

07:46.076 --> 07:47.276
Did you sleep here
last night?

07:47.310 --> 07:48.777
I wouldn't exactly
call it sleeping.

07:48.812 --> 07:50.112
Where'd you get that suit?

07:50.147 --> 07:51.915
Uh, Rachel.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.251
No, I mean Jenny gave it
to Rachel downstairs.

07:54.285 --> 07:55.585
She slept over last night.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.888
Jenny did, not Rachel.

07:57.923 --> 07:59.591
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.192
You want to learn how
it's done, right?

08:01.227 --> 08:03.529
I read this guy's employment
records, Harvey.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.631
He's smart, talented,
loyal.

08:05.666 --> 08:06.632
Oh, and you feel bad
for him.

08:06.667 --> 08:07.800
I'm shocked.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.470
Where's my smoking gun?

08:10.504 --> 08:11.771
Background check that
confirmed Stan lied

08:11.806 --> 08:12.839
about his credentials.

08:12.873 --> 08:15.075
It never came through.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.411
On it.

08:17.446 --> 08:20.047
Okay.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.249
Come in, come in.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.517
Um, could you help me
with something?

08:22.551 --> 08:23.952
I need to get this fax
for Harvey and it's--

08:23.986 --> 08:25.753
Good morning.

08:25.788 --> 08:27.455
Good morning.
He needs a--

08:27.489 --> 08:28.456
You can tell,
can't you?

08:28.490 --> 08:30.625
I bet you everybody can.

08:31.727 --> 08:34.828
Uh, tell what?

08:34.864 --> 08:36.831
You...wax your eyebrows?

08:36.866 --> 08:39.333
I was with the most beautiful
woman last night.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.504
Uh, she wax your eyebrows?

08:42.538 --> 08:44.206
We did a lot of things
last night

08:44.240 --> 08:46.441
and waxing wasn't
one of them,

08:46.476 --> 08:48.310
if you know what I mean.

08:48.344 --> 08:49.611
Oh, God.

08:49.645 --> 08:51.580
Uh, well, that's great.
I'm here to ask--

08:51.614 --> 08:53.281
Her name's Charisse
and we have so much in common.

08:53.316 --> 08:55.551
And Mike,
there was like this--

08:55.585 --> 08:56.819
there was like this,
"mmm."

08:56.853 --> 08:57.953
Mm-mm.

08:57.988 --> 08:59.254
- Like a "mmm."
- Mm-mm.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.322
Like a chemical thing
would happen

09:00.356 --> 09:01.857
when our bodies would touch.

09:01.891 --> 09:03.491
No, I really don't want to
have this conversation with you.

09:03.526 --> 09:04.693
Oh, come on.
We're both guys, right?

09:04.727 --> 09:06.795
Little locker room talk
around the office.

09:06.829 --> 09:08.196
I mean, that creates
a little male bonding.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.430
That's crazy.
I just heard my name.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.199
Did you hear that?
Someone's calling me.

09:11.233 --> 09:14.636
I'm gonna--
just one second, okay?

09:14.670 --> 09:16.771
He's probably still a virgin.

09:16.805 --> 09:18.105
Mr. Jacobson, hi.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.240
Mike Ross, Harvey's associate.

09:19.274 --> 09:20.441
So sorry to keep you waiting.

09:20.475 --> 09:21.942
Just gonna be a couple
more minutes, okay?

09:21.977 --> 09:24.345
Okay, great.
Thank you.

09:24.379 --> 09:25.646
Yes, I hear you.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.048
Your office couldn't
find a copy.

09:27.082 --> 09:28.816
Can you tell me the name
of the security firm

09:28.850 --> 09:31.786
you guys used to do
the background check?

09:31.820 --> 09:32.987
Okay, great.

09:33.021 --> 09:34.188
Uh, nope.
That's great.

09:34.223 --> 09:36.457
I found the number myself.
Thank you.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.658
Sally, yes.

09:37.692 --> 09:39.393
This is Mike Ross
for Pearson Hardman.

09:39.427 --> 09:42.329
I'm calling regarding
a background check you guys did.

09:42.363 --> 09:43.363
Uh, sure.

09:43.397 --> 09:44.798
You could refuse
to cooperate,

09:44.832 --> 09:47.000
but then you would be wrong.

09:47.034 --> 09:49.202
Uh, Sally,
hold on one minute.

09:49.236 --> 09:50.704
Yeah?

09:50.738 --> 09:51.905
Uh, no.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.974
Stan is going to be there
in two minutes.

09:54.009 --> 09:58.680
He's in the bathroom.
Okay.

09:58.714 --> 10:00.015
Sally, you there?

10:00.049 --> 10:01.383
Let's do this.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.219
Uh, I'm gonna fax you
the subpoena

10:03.253 --> 10:04.920
that I'm holding
in my hand right now

10:04.955 --> 10:09.225
and you can show that
to your boss and then we--

10:09.260 --> 10:10.760
great.

10:10.794 --> 10:14.163
Uh, let me send you
my fax number now.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.198
Nice.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.574
Stan.

10:25.608 --> 10:28.009
Oh, hey.
We ready?

10:28.043 --> 10:29.577
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.

10:29.611 --> 10:31.446
No worries.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.348
I know you,
by the way.

10:33.383 --> 10:37.052
7611053.

10:37.087 --> 10:38.287
Your employee code.

10:38.321 --> 10:39.689
See, I remember everyone
that way.

10:39.723 --> 10:40.890
Ahh.

10:40.924 --> 10:42.158
Anyway, you are taking me
to see Harvey.

10:42.192 --> 10:43.460
I have been dying to meet him.

10:43.494 --> 10:44.861
Why is that?

10:44.896 --> 10:47.130
His balls.

10:47.164 --> 10:48.865
His autographed ones.
I'm a huge baseball fan.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.801
Oh, right.
Really?

10:50.835 --> 10:51.902
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No.

10:51.936 --> 10:53.003
If I wasn't an accountant,

10:53.037 --> 10:54.605
I would be
a major league scout.

10:54.639 --> 10:55.773
I can tell you anything
you want to know

10:55.807 --> 10:57.808
just by looking
at somebody's numbers.

10:57.842 --> 10:59.409
For instance,
slugging percentage

10:59.444 --> 11:00.843
versus strikeouts during
spring training--

11:00.878 --> 11:02.578
Do you want
to walk and talk maybe?

11:02.613 --> 11:04.580
Ahh.

11:04.615 --> 11:06.548
Yeah, I could write a book.

11:07.851 --> 11:09.084
Stan Jacobson.

11:09.118 --> 11:10.919
Mr. Specter,
it is a pleasure.

11:10.953 --> 11:12.588
Stan, it's nice to meet you.

11:12.622 --> 11:14.056
- Has Mike alr--
- Oh, my God!

11:14.090 --> 11:17.226
Oh, my God!
Is that them?

11:17.260 --> 11:19.595
Oh!
Jeter.

11:19.629 --> 11:21.830
Hank Aaron.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.166
No way!
Maris?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.600
That's not number 61,
is it?

11:25.634 --> 11:27.269
No, but it was signed
by Tracy--

11:27.303 --> 11:28.904
Stallard.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.138
Ha-ha-ha!

11:30.173 --> 11:32.274
Big baseball fan.

11:32.308 --> 11:33.809
Stan, why don't you have
a seat over here?

11:33.843 --> 11:35.578
Hey, why don't I get us
some waters?

11:35.612 --> 11:37.780
Sorry.

11:37.814 --> 11:39.949
I get talking about baseball,
I cannot stop.

11:41.318 --> 11:42.952
Yeah, I know how valuable
your time is.

11:42.987 --> 11:45.188
I <i>do</i> do the books.

11:45.222 --> 11:47.357
And speaking of which,
your assistant tells me

11:47.391 --> 11:49.892
you wanted to go over something
from your last audits.

11:49.927 --> 11:53.429
I could really use a water.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.365
Stan, we're not here to go
over any accounting business.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.535
You're here because
you're being let go.

11:59.569 --> 12:00.669
What?

12:00.704 --> 12:02.071
It's not gonna feel
that surprising

12:02.105 --> 12:04.539
when you understand why.

12:04.574 --> 12:06.041
The firm looked into your
background recently.

12:06.075 --> 12:07.942
They know you lied about
passing the CPA exam.

12:07.976 --> 12:11.379
You were hired because of your
outstanding credentials

12:11.413 --> 12:15.216
and the reality is
they never existed.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.888
I've been there
for nine years.

12:20.922 --> 12:22.957
My work has been
nothing but--

12:24.192 --> 12:25.459
I mean, why would this
even matter now?

12:25.493 --> 12:27.394
You have been committing fraud
your entire career.

12:27.428 --> 12:28.862
The liability it presents--

12:28.897 --> 12:30.397
No!
I don't accept this.

12:30.431 --> 12:31.598
Okay, take a deep breath.

12:31.632 --> 12:33.300
Once you go over
the severance numbers,

12:33.334 --> 12:35.301
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

12:36.737 --> 12:38.872
Fair?

12:38.906 --> 12:41.107
You think this is fair?

12:41.142 --> 12:43.643
We understand how difficult
this must be, Stan.

12:43.677 --> 12:45.011
How you must feel right now.

12:45.046 --> 12:48.414
You have no idea what
I feel right now.

12:48.449 --> 12:50.417
Just so I'm clear--

12:50.451 --> 12:53.520
you're not denying what we're
presenting you with?

12:53.554 --> 12:57.791
You mean that I lied
back when Drybeck hired me?

13:01.329 --> 13:04.098
No.

13:04.132 --> 13:05.366
But I'm not some
scam artist either.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.601
I did go to college.

13:06.635 --> 13:09.037
I just...
couldn't afford to graduate.

13:09.071 --> 13:10.204
No one ever
questioned it before

13:10.239 --> 13:15.877
because I'm that good
with numbers.

13:15.911 --> 13:18.780
Then they find out
all of a sudden.

13:18.814 --> 13:21.882
They didn't.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.552
This background check
is five years old.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.554
What?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.189
That doesn't make sense.

13:28.223 --> 13:30.190
Is this the original?

13:30.225 --> 13:31.925
Yeah.

13:31.960 --> 13:37.666
So Tori knew...
all this time?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.735
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

13:39.769 --> 13:41.737
- Who?
- Paula.

13:41.771 --> 13:43.205
Discovered some
undisclosed income,

13:43.240 --> 13:45.474
the books weren't adding up,
she brought it to me.

13:45.509 --> 13:46.943
The next thing I know,
she is gone.

13:46.977 --> 13:48.378
I asked Tori about it,
then I start

13:48.412 --> 13:49.646
getting shut out of meetings.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.780
They're trying
to hide something

13:50.814 --> 13:52.315
and they're firing me
so they can.

13:52.349 --> 13:54.150
Hey,
where are you going?

13:54.184 --> 13:55.284
I'm not signing
some agreement.

13:55.318 --> 13:56.552
Are you kidding me?

13:56.586 --> 13:59.054
I'm getting railroaded!

13:59.089 --> 14:00.822
- Should I go after him?
- No.

14:00.857 --> 14:04.492
You've done enough already.

14:07.674 --> 14:09.175
So you let him leave?

14:09.209 --> 14:10.743
Physically restraining someone

14:10.778 --> 14:12.612
is not in my job description.

14:12.647 --> 14:14.548
Well, what about
your associate,

14:14.582 --> 14:16.450
the one who shared
the background check?

14:16.484 --> 14:19.020
That was a confidential
internal document.

14:19.054 --> 14:20.121
Stan should have never
seen it.

14:20.156 --> 14:22.090
Why did you even have it?

14:22.124 --> 14:23.959
You didn't expect us to fire
him without proof, did you?

14:23.993 --> 14:26.728
Tori's right.
Stan shouldn't have seen it.

14:26.762 --> 14:28.162
Then I'm guilty
of being thorough.

14:28.197 --> 14:29.764
Hey, I still don't understand
why you haven't

14:29.798 --> 14:30.965
told us the whole truth.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.933
I mean, if you knew
five years ago,

14:32.968 --> 14:34.434
why'd you make it sound like
this is something recent?

14:34.469 --> 14:36.436
Because it only came
to my attention two days ago.

14:36.470 --> 14:37.804
Then who ordered
the background check?

14:37.838 --> 14:40.273
It's routine.
You check with human resources.

14:40.307 --> 14:42.408
Is it routine
for human resources

14:42.443 --> 14:45.410
to keep something from
the CEO for half a decade?

14:45.445 --> 14:47.112
What are you insinuating?

14:47.147 --> 14:49.581
I think what Harvey
is saying is given

14:49.616 --> 14:53.018
how quickly we tried
to accomplish this,

14:53.053 --> 14:54.319
some of the details
might have gotten lost.

14:54.354 --> 14:56.322
What was also lost
is that Stan

14:56.356 --> 14:58.258
never signed
the severance package,

14:58.292 --> 15:00.393
which included
the confidentiality agreement,

15:00.428 --> 15:01.661
which means if he decides
to make waves,

15:01.696 --> 15:04.064
the whole point of avoiding
negative publicity--

15:04.099 --> 15:05.766
Harvey will
track down Stan

15:05.800 --> 15:08.502
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

15:08.536 --> 15:11.505
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

15:11.539 --> 15:14.609
You have my word.

15:14.643 --> 15:16.077
Thank you.

15:16.111 --> 15:18.113
Of course.

15:22.852 --> 15:26.821
It's allight, Tori.

15:26.856 --> 15:29.190
She's lying.

15:29.225 --> 15:30.191
She knew about Stan.

15:30.226 --> 15:31.626
She's known for a long time.

15:31.660 --> 15:33.094
And that matters to us why?

15:33.128 --> 15:34.762
Because she's taking
advantage of us.

15:34.796 --> 15:36.430
We are being manipulated
into firing

15:36.464 --> 15:38.966
one of her employees and told
not to ask questions.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.367
Well, I have questions.

15:40.401 --> 15:43.203
And the answer is ten.

15:43.237 --> 15:45.939
As in $10 million per year--

15:45.973 --> 15:49.443
the amount of business Drybeck
generates for this firm.

15:49.477 --> 15:52.580
Which means you have
to finish what you started.

15:52.614 --> 15:56.351
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

15:56.385 --> 15:57.819
Oh, and as far as
I'm concerned,

15:57.854 --> 16:00.022
that little associate of yours
iso blame for all of this.

16:00.056 --> 16:01.190
That was an honest mistake.

16:01.224 --> 16:02.692
He knowingly revealed

16:02.726 --> 16:04.694
the client's
confidential document.

16:04.728 --> 16:08.498
That is not a mistake.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.699
How many more chances
are you gonna give that kid?

16:10.734 --> 16:13.402
Oh, I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

16:13.437 --> 16:14.637
But if that's the case,
I still think

16:14.671 --> 16:26.547
he's coming out ahead.

16:26.582 --> 16:28.416
Whatever you're doing,
stop.

16:28.451 --> 16:29.951
Wait, you're gonna want
to see this.

16:29.986 --> 16:32.588
Paula O'Neil, the former Drybeck
employee that Stan mentioned,

16:32.622 --> 16:34.657
she filed a wrongful
termination suit

16:34.691 --> 16:35.825
that mysteriously went away.

16:35.859 --> 16:40.330
Really?
Let me see that.

16:40.364 --> 16:44.201
Come with me.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.502
Wait.

16:45.536 --> 16:46.737
Do you not think something
funny's going on?

16:46.771 --> 16:47.804
You know what?

16:47.839 --> 16:49.405
Here's what I think
is going on.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.406
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

16:50.441 --> 16:51.741
That doesn't mean that--

16:51.775 --> 16:52.942
You need to learn something
from what just happened,

16:52.976 --> 16:55.077
not the least of which
is how anyone,

16:55.112 --> 16:57.179
no matter how valuable,
can be let go.

16:57.213 --> 16:58.847
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

16:58.881 --> 17:01.516
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.784
So if you want to work here,
you better go home now,

17:03.819 --> 17:05.019
because if she sees you--
- Wait, wait.

17:05.053 --> 17:06.086
Is she gonna fire me?

17:06.121 --> 17:07.488
This habit of you
empathizing

17:07.522 --> 17:09.523
with every client,
it's not getting you anywhere.

17:09.558 --> 17:11.759
You want to work
in this firm?

17:11.794 --> 17:13.694
You need to deal in facts,
evidence,

17:13.729 --> 17:15.464
information that can hold up.

17:15.498 --> 17:18.768
That's what a real lawyer does.

17:35.686 --> 17:38.988
Stan.

17:39.022 --> 17:40.656
Did you follow me here?

17:40.691 --> 17:42.291
Doesn't take a sleuth
to figure out

17:42.326 --> 17:45.260
that your next step would be
to see another lawyer.

17:45.294 --> 17:47.362
Bopal and Williams.

17:47.396 --> 17:50.165
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.333
They called you.

17:51.368 --> 17:52.535
That is against lawyer-client
privilege.

17:52.569 --> 17:53.936
No one's breaking any laws,
okay?

17:53.970 --> 17:56.471
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

17:56.506 --> 17:58.006
that tell her anything
she wants to know,

17:58.040 --> 18:00.475
like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

18:00.509 --> 18:02.043
You forgot this when you left.

18:02.078 --> 18:03.678
I said I'm not
signing anything.

18:03.713 --> 18:05.280
It's nothing to sign.

18:05.314 --> 18:06.681
It's a lawsuit.

18:06.716 --> 18:09.518
You worked for Drybeck
for 9 years,

18:09.552 --> 18:12.654
oversaw 80 clients,
filed hundreds of tax returns,

18:12.689 --> 18:13.989
and fought 27 audits.

18:14.023 --> 18:17.259
Now, in light of your recently
discovered fraud,

18:17.293 --> 18:19.160
all of that can now
be called into question.

18:19.194 --> 18:23.130
Therefore, you are being sued
for nine years back pay,

18:23.165 --> 18:26.334
plus any expenses incurred to
mitigate the damage you've done.

18:26.368 --> 18:29.437
This is--

18:29.471 --> 18:31.205
this would bankrupt me.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.808
Or you can take
what's behind door number two.

18:37.245 --> 18:39.213
- It's Aberdeen.
- Who?

18:39.248 --> 18:40.715
It's not a "Who."
It's a "What."

18:40.749 --> 18:42.183
Drybeck is doing business
with them

18:42.217 --> 18:43.384
and I think that's where
the problem lies.

18:43.419 --> 18:44.686
You don't get it,
okay?

18:44.720 --> 18:46.454
I'm only leaving with
one of these,

18:46.488 --> 18:48.189
and if it's
the lawsuit,

18:48.224 --> 18:49.757
the first thing your friends
upstairs

18:49.792 --> 18:51.659
are gonna ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

18:51.694 --> 18:53.528
And when you tell them
that Harvey Specter

18:53.562 --> 18:54.896
is the one that's suing you,

18:54.931 --> 18:56.931
you're gonna watch the color
drain from their faces.

18:56.966 --> 19:01.503
Now what would you
like to do?

19:04.373 --> 19:06.207
This is not cool.

19:06.241 --> 19:07.675
You leave me in
your apartment all night

19:07.709 --> 19:09.110
and say you're gonna
be right back.

19:09.144 --> 19:11.045
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

19:11.079 --> 19:13.314
I had a bad day, Jenny.

19:13.348 --> 19:14.482
So you couldn't call me?

19:14.516 --> 19:15.749
I almost got fired, okay?

19:15.784 --> 19:17.851
What happened?

19:17.886 --> 19:21.154
It--it's not worth
explaining.

19:21.189 --> 19:22.856
Okay.

19:22.891 --> 19:24.024
I need to find evidence

19:24.058 --> 19:25.626
that our accounting firm
is up to something,

19:25.660 --> 19:28.363
so I found this woman who filed
a wrongful termination suit

19:28.397 --> 19:30.298
against them, but then
she referred me to her lawyer.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.599
Did you call them?

19:31.634 --> 19:32.868
Yeah, but they're
this huge firm.

19:32.902 --> 19:34.069
Unger and Macy.

19:34.104 --> 19:35.904
They wouldn't take my call.

19:35.939 --> 19:37.240
Why not?

19:37.274 --> 19:38.341
There's
a confidentiality clause

19:38.375 --> 19:40.009
in the settlement, for one.

19:40.043 --> 19:41.545
So?

19:41.579 --> 19:45.149
So it means that they can't
share details like that.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.283
You know,
I thought all lawyers

19:46.318 --> 19:48.018
secretly shared that stuff.

19:48.053 --> 19:52.155
You're all in the same club,
right?

19:52.190 --> 19:53.223
What?

19:53.257 --> 19:54.491
That's not a dumb thing
to assume.

19:54.525 --> 19:55.559
No, no, no, no.

19:55.593 --> 19:59.462
That's not dumb at all,
because...

19:59.496 --> 20:00.796
We all are in the same club.

20:00.831 --> 20:03.632
Unger and Macy have almost
as many Harvard grads

20:03.667 --> 20:04.933
as we do,
which means--

20:04.968 --> 20:06.702
They're gonna be
at the mixer tonight.

20:06.736 --> 20:08.738
And there are two things
that lawyers love to do.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.272
Drink and talk.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.211
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:14.245 --> 20:17.080
Uh, Mike Ross,
class of 2011.

20:17.114 --> 20:18.548
Ross.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.750
Sorry, I don't have you on here.

20:19.784 --> 20:20.818
Do you have your I.D.?

20:20.852 --> 20:21.952
I can run it through
the computer.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.187
Uh, my Harvard I.D.?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.690
What did you say your name
was again?

20:25.725 --> 20:29.160
Michael Ross
of Pearson Hardman.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.463
Boy, you think they ask Harvey
for his I.D.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.365
when he comes to this place?

20:33.399 --> 20:34.466
Harvey Specter?

20:34.500 --> 20:38.203
You work with Harvey Specter?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.771
Uh, yeah, yes.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.106
I'm his associate.

20:41.141 --> 20:42.875
I can call him if you like.

20:42.910 --> 20:46.780
Just don't tell him
I gave you any trouble, okay?

20:46.814 --> 20:47.948
Welcome.

20:47.982 --> 20:50.084
Thank you.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.952
Mmm.

20:51.987 --> 20:53.955
Oh, God.
I'm never gonna survive this.

20:53.989 --> 20:58.226
Deep breaths.
You'll be fine.

21:09.139 --> 21:10.673
Hey.

21:10.707 --> 21:12.007
I saw the signed severance
papers on my desk.

21:12.042 --> 21:14.943
- Thank you.
- And I also left word for Tori.

21:14.977 --> 21:16.144
Yes, we spoke.

21:16.178 --> 21:17.578
She's relieved,
but I wouldn't go so far

21:17.613 --> 21:19.313
as to say completely forgiving.

21:19.348 --> 21:21.816
You ever heard
of Aberdeen Solutions?

21:21.850 --> 21:24.084
Drybeck listed them
as a consultant firm.

21:24.118 --> 21:26.253
They bill us every month
for their management services.

21:26.287 --> 21:27.922
Okay.

21:27.956 --> 21:29.256
What does that mean?

21:29.291 --> 21:31.359
- Check with accounting.
- I did.

21:31.393 --> 21:33.761
They can only tell me
how much we pay them,

21:33.796 --> 21:35.797
so I called Aberdeen directly.

21:35.831 --> 21:37.399
It's an automated
answering system.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.035
I left six messages.
No returns.

21:40.070 --> 21:41.837
Stan mentioned it.

21:41.871 --> 21:45.241
Something just doesn't
feel right.

21:45.275 --> 21:47.176
Are you saying you want
to investigate our client?

21:47.210 --> 21:48.443
They're also our accountants.

21:48.477 --> 21:51.880
And Tori is also a friend.

21:51.914 --> 21:53.748
Harvey, if you got caught--

21:53.782 --> 21:58.019
I wouldn't get caught.

21:58.053 --> 22:03.091
I am explicitly telling you
not to do this.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.492
Well, then I'll let you know
what I don't find

22:05.527 --> 22:09.029
after I don't look into it.

22:22.038 --> 22:23.638
Hey, should we get the rest
of the 2010 grads

22:23.673 --> 22:25.273
with us for a pic?

22:25.308 --> 22:27.175
The rest?
This is 2011. No way.

22:27.210 --> 22:31.013
Isn't he from
the 2010 class?

22:33.482 --> 22:35.716
No, no.
I was 2011.

22:35.751 --> 22:37.819
You're not with us.

22:37.853 --> 22:40.387
Yeah, Rudy...
It's Mike.

22:40.422 --> 22:42.223
You know, we--
we hung out a bunch.

22:42.258 --> 22:44.292
Where?

22:44.326 --> 22:45.560
Oh, you know what?

22:45.594 --> 22:46.761
Maybe I'm thinking about
somebody else.

22:46.795 --> 22:48.095
Sorry about that.

22:48.130 --> 22:53.734
Has anyone seen that guy
here before?

22:53.768 --> 22:54.969
Hey.

22:55.003 --> 22:56.437
I'm not having any luck.

22:56.472 --> 22:57.839
Wish I could
say different, love.

22:57.873 --> 22:59.440
But it's been a Potter's Field
for me too.

22:59.475 --> 23:00.575
What?

23:00.609 --> 23:02.244
You get to pretend
to be someone else.

23:02.279 --> 23:03.746
I wanted to try.
It's fun.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.449
Accent?
Hmm.

23:06.484 --> 23:09.085
Okay, I'll stop.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.487
What?

23:10.522 --> 23:13.391
You're amazing.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.361
And that's Brian Jennings.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.296
Who's Brian Jennings?

23:19.331 --> 23:21.498
I saw his face on
Unger and Macy's website today.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.200
What are you waiting for?
Go.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.976
Hi.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.546
Ten days
for public exposure.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.615
Next time you need a bathroom
in Times Square,

23:36.649 --> 23:38.283
go into a hotel.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.053
Five-minute recess.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.061
Harvey.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.495
Long time, Anthony.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.663
Heh.

23:51.698 --> 23:52.698
You keep company
with the high rollers

23:52.732 --> 23:54.866
on Center Street.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.935
What are you doing down
in night court?

23:56.970 --> 23:58.570
I need a favor.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.006
What kind of favor?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.141
One that requires access
to sealed court documents.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.110
Can it wait till tomorrow?

24:05.145 --> 24:06.578
I got this backlog of case--

24:06.613 --> 24:08.780
When you came to me two years
ago in the middle of the night,

24:08.815 --> 24:12.984
did I tell you it
had to wait till tomorrow?

24:13.019 --> 24:17.122
My chambers.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.391
So...this is quite
a surprise.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.093
Who'd ever think that you and
I would on a double date?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.262
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.597
You had to notice when you
walked in the room.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.098
She's absolutely gorgeous.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.767
And she's completely infatuated
with your girlfriend.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.168
Ah.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.437
Come on.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.604
Come on, I'll introduce you
to her.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.840
Charisse, honey...

24:35.874 --> 24:37.875
uh, this is one
of my associates, Mike Ross.

24:37.909 --> 24:39.343
Oh, so nice to meet you.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.145
And I'm in love with your date.

24:41.179 --> 24:42.546
Seriously.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.347
She's just been telling me about
her work with monkeys.

24:44.382 --> 24:45.849
It's fascinating.
Huh?

24:45.883 --> 24:47.884
So really,
they're as smart as us?

24:47.918 --> 24:49.719
Oh, smarter.

24:49.753 --> 24:52.822
I never had a chance
with him.

24:52.856 --> 24:54.724
I need to use
the ladies' room.

24:54.758 --> 24:57.393
Would you excuse me?

24:57.427 --> 24:59.229
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans, sorry.

24:59.263 --> 25:02.299
That depends on which humans
you're talking about, I guess.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.435
- What?
- Huh?

25:04.469 --> 25:06.203
Name of case and rough date?

25:06.238 --> 25:08.306
Aberdeen versus
Paula O'Neill,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.475
say six months ago.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.477
Oh, let's see.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.013
Says here that they were
listed as a subsidiary

25:15.047 --> 25:17.048
of Drybeck in a wrongful
termination suit.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.549
That's it.
That's what I'm looking for.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.818
I can't print this out.
I'll get tagged.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.421
Come around.
Take a look.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.522
Is that what you're after?

25:24.556 --> 25:26.256
Yeah, that's it.

25:26.291 --> 25:31.394
But what's that?

25:31.429 --> 25:33.463
That links to another
court filing

25:33.465 --> 25:35.031
in relation to Aberdeen.

25:35.065 --> 25:37.401
Click on it.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.470
Says here that they filed
for dissolution...

25:39.504 --> 25:41.205
earlier today.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.307
The whole company?

25:42.341 --> 25:44.042
That's what it says.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.444
They're officially shut down.

25:45.478 --> 25:50.049
I'm gonna need
one more favor.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.684
I think it's great
that you found someone

25:51.719 --> 25:53.052
not in law who works out
in the real world.

25:53.087 --> 25:54.754
Why do you say that?

25:54.789 --> 25:56.789
Because I'm stuck
in a suit all day

25:56.824 --> 25:58.424
or an office or a courtroom.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.092
I think it'd be nice
to be in nature.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.426
Don't you, Mike?

26:01.461 --> 26:02.761
Well, I love that
you're a lawyer.

26:02.795 --> 26:08.633
In fact, I'd love to see
where you work sometime.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.801
You would?

26:10.835 --> 26:12.803
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

26:12.837 --> 26:13.971
- No.
- Yeah.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.072
You think we can go?

26:15.106 --> 26:16.374
- Yeah.
- Right now?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.608
Now.
Yeah.

26:17.643 --> 26:18.843
- So great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

26:18.877 --> 26:19.844
Have good night.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.147
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.216
Okay, why didn't you
do that sooner?

26:24.250 --> 26:27.653
Because...
I had to get this first.

26:27.688 --> 26:29.288
That's the guy, right?
From the firm.

26:29.323 --> 26:30.490
That's his employee I.D.

26:30.524 --> 26:32.058
- He gave this to you?
- No, I stole it.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.260
What?

26:34.295 --> 26:36.596
Listen, you could spend all
night trying to get to the guy

26:36.630 --> 26:39.165
or you could just go into
his firm yourself and look.

26:39.199 --> 26:40.299
Come on.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.400
Let's go.

26:49.376 --> 26:51.243
Yeah, I can barely keep
my eyes open myself.

26:51.278 --> 26:54.012
Filing briefs sucks.

27:19.648 --> 27:22.142
You actually came.

27:22.143 --> 27:25.210
You must be Harvey Specter.

27:25.245 --> 27:27.336
"Joe," was it?

27:27.337 --> 27:28.871
Your friend fill you in on
the deal that's on the table?

27:28.905 --> 27:31.306
Let me just get it straight.

27:31.341 --> 27:32.908
You caught him rifling
through some files,

27:32.942 --> 27:34.409
and in lieu of calling
the police,

27:34.444 --> 27:35.444
you want me to pay you off?

27:35.478 --> 27:37.345
I never said that.

27:37.379 --> 27:38.546
He did.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.348
Oh, that's great.

27:40.382 --> 27:42.517
This way, if I level
a charge of extortion,

27:42.551 --> 27:44.218
it's hearsay, huh?

27:44.252 --> 27:45.853
Ten years working
for a law firm,

27:45.887 --> 27:47.554
you learn a thing or two,
which is good,

27:47.588 --> 27:49.722
'cause you sure as hell don't
make a lot of money doing it.

27:49.757 --> 27:51.191
Somehow I think you're
getting by fine.

27:51.225 --> 27:53.627
Just saying, on the level
you guys play at,

27:53.661 --> 27:56.396
espionage happens all the time,
which is why I know

27:56.431 --> 27:58.199
you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

27:58.233 --> 28:02.003
Well actually, Joe Speena,
of 2561 Clover Lane,

28:02.037 --> 28:04.372
Astoria, Queens,
I think we all would.

28:04.406 --> 28:06.740
Like those tax returns
you filed jointly

28:06.775 --> 28:09.743
for the last six years while
no longer living with your wife.

28:09.778 --> 28:11.812
You know, the IRS
can destroy you for that.

28:11.846 --> 28:15.015
You think you're the first
person to try to extort me, Joe?

28:15.049 --> 28:16.582
'Cause that's the level
I play at.

28:16.617 --> 28:18.785
Now...You're a security guard

28:18.819 --> 28:20.620
who likes to take risks.

28:20.654 --> 28:21.754
I like that.

28:21.788 --> 28:22.922
So here's what we're
gonna do.

28:22.956 --> 28:24.924
This here's
a generous donation

28:24.959 --> 28:27.093
to Joey junior's
little league team.

28:27.128 --> 28:28.695
Now, if it gets to them,
it gets to them.

28:28.729 --> 28:30.330
If it doesn't,
it doesn't.

28:30.364 --> 28:32.332
But the next time we talk,

28:32.366 --> 28:35.101
it's gonna be me
who wants a favor.

28:39.507 --> 28:41.442
Officer.

28:41.476 --> 28:43.277
Do I really
need to pay you back?

28:43.311 --> 28:45.879
Let's start
with an explanation.

28:45.914 --> 28:47.548
You said I needed
to find evidence,

28:47.582 --> 28:48.715
so I went to find some.

28:48.749 --> 28:50.250
By breaking into
another law firm?

28:50.284 --> 28:52.385
Is that really worse than
paying off a security guard?

28:52.420 --> 28:54.120
Okay, first of all,
I didn't pay him off.

28:54.154 --> 28:55.588
Second of all,
if I hadn't paid him off,

28:55.623 --> 28:58.291
you'd be in jail right now.

28:58.325 --> 28:59.626
You think I might
be right about Stan.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.294
No, I never said
you were wrong.

29:01.328 --> 29:03.329
I said we needed evidence.

29:03.363 --> 29:05.598
But did you find something?

29:05.632 --> 29:09.369
Drybeck bought
a shelf company 13 months ago.

29:09.403 --> 29:11.304
What's a shelf company?

29:11.338 --> 29:13.940
It's a corporation
that exists only on paper,

29:13.974 --> 29:16.509
so its owners can hide
their assets.

29:16.544 --> 29:17.510
Isn't that a shell company?

29:17.545 --> 29:19.179
No, it's a shelf company.

29:19.213 --> 29:21.881
Okay, take a shell company,
give it a bank account,

29:21.915 --> 29:23.883
credit history, tax returns,

29:23.918 --> 29:27.254
and let it season for years
on a shelf.

29:27.288 --> 29:29.557
Someone buys it,
slots their name into it,

29:29.591 --> 29:32.427
and they walk away with
an established corporation

29:32.461 --> 29:34.329
with a preexisting history.

29:34.363 --> 29:35.397
Anyone looks any closer,

29:35.431 --> 29:37.099
they shut it down
and do it again.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.534
That's legal?

29:38.568 --> 29:40.069
Shelf companies are legal.

29:40.103 --> 29:42.840
I'm guessing what Tori's
doing with hers isn't.

29:42.874 --> 29:45.176
Wait a minute.
Is it called "Aberdeen"?

29:45.210 --> 29:46.677
Yeah, I saw it on the top
of this list

29:46.711 --> 29:48.713
with 37 other
management companies

29:48.715 --> 29:53.951
all related to Drybeck in
that wrongful termination suit.

29:53.985 --> 29:55.252
When we get back
to the office,

29:55.286 --> 29:56.587
I want you to find
legal precedent

29:56.621 --> 29:58.688
that will allow us
to subpoena the records.

29:58.723 --> 30:00.223
Okay, on it.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.724
Do I really have
to pay you back?

30:01.759 --> 30:02.926
Every penny.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.560
Wait a minute.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.230
How much was in that envelope?

30:13.602 --> 30:15.803
Hey, what are you all doing
at my desk?

30:15.838 --> 30:18.405
Dude, you got to check
this out.

30:21.242 --> 30:25.245
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

30:25.279 --> 30:26.546
Is that Louis?

30:26.580 --> 30:27.880
Uh-huh.
In the lobby.

30:27.915 --> 30:29.916
Is this a security camera?
A live feed?

30:29.950 --> 30:31.017
- What are you guys doing?
- No, no.

30:31.052 --> 30:32.419
This is from last night.

30:32.454 --> 30:33.787
The guys in security emailed it
up to Louis this morning.

30:33.821 --> 30:36.456
And why are we watching it
on my computer?

30:36.491 --> 30:38.458
Well, we're not gonna risk
watching it on one of ours.

30:38.493 --> 30:39.627
And everyone knows
your password.

30:39.661 --> 30:41.728
How does everybody
know my password?

30:41.763 --> 30:43.029
"Ross999."

30:43.064 --> 30:44.998
How hard is that to crack?

30:45.032 --> 30:46.666
Okay, "999" increases
the odds of--

30:46.700 --> 30:49.335
Oh, shh!
Here it comes.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.770
What?

30:55.575 --> 30:57.008
Oh, no.

30:57.043 --> 30:58.609
What did he say to her?

30:58.644 --> 31:00.811
Oh, evidently Louis wants
a restraining order

31:00.846 --> 31:02.213
and he needs this
as evidence.

31:02.247 --> 31:03.614
Oh.

31:03.648 --> 31:05.149
What?

31:05.183 --> 31:07.552
Uh, um, it--

31:07.586 --> 31:09.888
okay, listen.
Please don't.

31:09.922 --> 31:11.857
I came in here and it--

31:11.891 --> 31:13.859
look, I--

31:13.893 --> 31:15.161
are you okay now?

31:15.195 --> 31:19.666
Louis?

31:22.403 --> 31:23.604
If the message you left
was another trick

31:23.638 --> 31:24.972
to get me down here--

31:25.006 --> 31:26.573
No tricks, I assure you.
Come on in.

31:26.607 --> 31:27.740
Stan, I'm Jessica Pearson.

31:27.775 --> 31:29.375
Oh, yeah.
I know who you are.

31:29.410 --> 31:31.544
You said if I accepted
the severance agreement,

31:31.578 --> 31:32.845
there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

31:32.879 --> 31:34.313
Well, there is one,

31:34.347 --> 31:36.048
but not against you.

31:36.082 --> 31:37.582
With you.

31:37.617 --> 31:39.017
We know about Aberdeen.

31:39.051 --> 31:40.885
We know what Tori
was orchestrating.

31:40.919 --> 31:43.254
And with your help,
we can expose her.

31:47.259 --> 31:49.193
Why should I help you?

31:49.227 --> 31:53.096
What have you got to lose?

31:56.266 --> 31:58.067
Tell me what you
need me to do.

32:03.374 --> 32:05.675
Hey.

32:05.709 --> 32:07.776
What does he have you
trying to find this time?

32:07.811 --> 32:12.647
You really want to know?

32:12.682 --> 32:14.683
Uh, I managed
to get a look at some files

32:14.717 --> 32:16.418
involving our accounting firm.

32:16.452 --> 32:18.587
What's up with
our accounting firm?

32:18.621 --> 32:20.555
They're stealing from us.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.057
You know your phone bill?

32:23.092 --> 32:24.625
You have all those surcharges,

32:24.659 --> 32:26.126
you have no idea what they mean,
but you pay 'em anyway.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.527
Yeah.

32:27.562 --> 32:28.695
Yeah, well, Drybeck's doing
the same thing to us,

32:28.729 --> 32:31.395
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

32:31.420 --> 32:33.341
Pretty sure the phone
charges are a scam too.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.800
Yeah, maybe.

32:34.835 --> 32:37.536
So what do you need?

32:37.570 --> 32:39.938
I need a legal reason
to get those files

32:39.972 --> 32:43.041
without saying
I saw those files.

32:43.075 --> 32:45.944
You need them for court
or you just need them?

32:45.979 --> 32:48.147
Why?

32:48.181 --> 32:49.548
You said you read 'em,
right?

32:49.583 --> 32:50.583
Yeah.

32:50.618 --> 32:53.086
So then you already
have them...

32:53.120 --> 32:55.121
in here.

32:55.156 --> 32:56.556
You're right.
I do.

32:56.591 --> 32:58.725
Yes, so you dictate,
I'll type.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.160
What?

33:00.195 --> 33:02.763
You'd actually do that for me?

33:02.798 --> 33:03.998
They're stealing from us.

33:04.032 --> 33:06.767
Person Hardman is my firm too.

33:06.802 --> 33:08.102
Come on.

33:08.136 --> 33:10.771
Okay.

33:10.806 --> 33:12.073
With the party
of the third part,

33:12.107 --> 33:15.242
hereto referred
to as Norton LLC--

33:16.766 --> 33:19.167
any claim that might
reasonably be anticipated--

33:19.202 --> 33:20.569
we acknowledge that such
appointment

33:20.603 --> 33:22.570
is irrevocable
and shall be deemed--

33:22.605 --> 33:25.006
lawfully invested with
the power to make such contracts

33:25.040 --> 33:30.533
or to perform acts from which
can be lawfully implied.

33:31.754 --> 33:32.754
That's it.
Did we get it?

33:32.870 --> 33:34.938
Saving and wait for it...

33:34.973 --> 33:36.707
Done.

33:36.741 --> 33:38.208
Oh.

33:42.914 --> 33:44.381
What?

33:44.416 --> 33:46.617
Your mind.

33:46.651 --> 33:49.586
It's just--
it's amazing.

33:49.621 --> 33:51.455
Thanks.

33:51.489 --> 33:53.223
What?

33:53.258 --> 33:55.058
Your mind's amazing too.

33:55.093 --> 33:57.627
Oh, thank you.

33:57.662 --> 33:59.863
Thank you.

33:59.897 --> 34:01.298
Who you calling this late?

34:01.332 --> 34:02.732
Oh.

34:02.767 --> 34:04.167
She's waiting up for you?

34:04.201 --> 34:06.202
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's pretty late.

34:06.237 --> 34:07.737
She's probably sleeping
by now.

34:07.772 --> 34:09.005
I'll just text her.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.841
It's tough to have
a relationship

34:10.875 --> 34:13.344
with the first year
or any year.

34:13.379 --> 34:15.346
You just don't have a life.

34:15.380 --> 34:16.815
How'd you make it work?

34:16.849 --> 34:18.417
Who said I did?

34:18.451 --> 34:21.320
It's--it's impossible
to have anything long-term

34:21.355 --> 34:22.621
unless you find someone
that has the same

34:22.656 --> 34:25.491
80-hour work week
and then...

34:25.525 --> 34:27.760
that doesn't work either,
because they're busy too.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.762
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
let that be the reason

34:29.795 --> 34:32.797
that Jenny and I don't--

34:43.909 --> 34:45.409
What are you two
still doing here?

34:45.444 --> 34:47.012
- Uh, it's for Harvey.
- Nothing.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.447
- Uh, but we're done.
- Good night.

34:48.481 --> 34:49.681
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
- Good night.

34:49.716 --> 34:50.750
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:55.489 --> 34:57.056
I'm sure you're aware
of this,

34:57.091 --> 34:59.960
but, um, I'm just gonna
remind you anyway.

34:59.994 --> 35:03.898
Um, this office frowns upon
relationships in the workplace.

35:03.932 --> 35:06.934
Yeah.

35:27.931 --> 35:30.166
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.600
That's okay.

35:31.635 --> 35:33.935
Um...Hey.

35:33.970 --> 35:36.572
Uh, thank you for last night.

35:36.606 --> 35:38.241
The typing.

35:38.275 --> 35:39.609
- Of course-- right.
- Yeah.

35:39.644 --> 35:41.078
- Absolutely.
- It was really helpful.

35:41.112 --> 35:42.145
Mm-hmm.

35:43.581 --> 35:45.416
Um, hold on one second.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.351
Sorry.
Hello?

35:47.386 --> 35:48.586
I said I needed you
in my office.

35:48.620 --> 35:49.720
And I said I was
on my way.

35:49.755 --> 35:51.556
Save it.
Those the files?

35:51.590 --> 35:53.124
Yes, take them, please.

35:53.158 --> 35:54.225
Stan is in my office.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.360
Meet us in
the conference room.

35:55.394 --> 35:58.496
Okay.

35:58.530 --> 35:59.964
Yeah.

35:59.998 --> 36:01.165
Sorry to keep you waiting.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.233
That's okay.

36:02.267 --> 36:03.634
I got your email

36:03.669 --> 36:05.536
with a list of other law firms.

36:05.570 --> 36:07.171
I respect your effort
to make amends

36:07.205 --> 36:08.439
by referring new clients.

36:08.473 --> 36:11.141
That wasn't a list
for client referrals.

36:11.176 --> 36:12.676
Those are firms you should
consider for representation.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.510
We're no longer
your attorneys, Tori.

36:14.545 --> 36:15.845
What?

36:15.879 --> 36:17.146
We have no choice really.

36:17.181 --> 36:18.715
It would be impossible
to represent you

36:18.749 --> 36:21.017
when we plan on suing you
for every penny you've got.

36:21.051 --> 36:22.986
Is this a joke?

36:23.021 --> 36:24.455
Aberdeen Solutions.

36:24.489 --> 36:26.356
Created in June of 2006.

36:26.391 --> 36:28.558
Sold to Drybeck 2010.

36:28.593 --> 36:30.260
Dissolved two days ago.

36:30.295 --> 36:32.329
Before that,
it was Bolton Finances.

36:32.363 --> 36:33.830
And before that,
it was Norton Services,

36:33.865 --> 36:35.265
Littleton LLC.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.267
Where did you get those?

36:36.301 --> 36:38.002
We know what you did, Tori.

36:38.036 --> 36:39.303
You couldn't have subpoenaed
these files.

36:39.337 --> 36:40.771
And yet we have them.

36:40.806 --> 36:42.006
Take a look.
They're all there.

36:42.041 --> 36:44.242
- And now we have proof.
- Proof of what?

36:44.277 --> 36:46.612
Those are all legitimate
corporations used for--

36:46.646 --> 36:48.748
Stealing money
and lining your own pockets.

36:48.782 --> 36:50.650
But don't take my word for it.

36:50.684 --> 36:53.687
Guys?

36:58.159 --> 36:59.860
Hello, Tori.

36:59.895 --> 37:02.363
Yeah, we hired Stan to do
a little independent consulting

37:02.397 --> 37:04.264
on our behalf
and he's come

37:04.299 --> 37:06.100
with some very interesting
connections.

37:06.134 --> 37:08.669
It was easy, even if I don't
really have a degree.

37:08.704 --> 37:13.041
There was that vacation
you invited me on last year...

37:13.075 --> 37:15.043
to your new house
in the Bahamas.

37:15.077 --> 37:17.945
A house you bought with money
you stole from this firm.

37:17.979 --> 37:19.981
My firm.

37:20.015 --> 37:20.982
Jessica--

37:21.016 --> 37:22.550
"Jessica" what?

37:22.584 --> 37:24.552
You can't use any of this.

37:24.586 --> 37:26.821
We have attorney-client
privilege.

37:26.855 --> 37:28.222
With Drybeck Accounting,
yes.

37:28.257 --> 37:30.691
With the shelf companies?
No.

37:30.726 --> 37:31.926
And unfortunately for you,

37:31.960 --> 37:34.228
you're listed
on the shelf companies.

37:34.262 --> 37:36.463
You stole from me.

37:36.498 --> 37:38.666
You either come clean now
or the only time

37:38.700 --> 37:40.935
you'll see your children
in the next decade

37:40.969 --> 37:43.504
will be during prison
visiting hours.

37:48.110 --> 37:50.078
So I'm gonna get
my job back now, right?

37:50.112 --> 37:51.646
I don't see why not.

37:51.681 --> 37:53.248
No, Stan, you're not.

37:53.283 --> 37:54.817
What?

37:54.851 --> 37:57.553
Drybeck's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

37:57.588 --> 37:59.889
Even if they don't,
they're not gonna hire you back.

37:59.923 --> 38:02.659
Why?

38:02.693 --> 38:08.566
Because you falsified
your resume.

38:08.601 --> 38:10.468
What am I supposed
to do now?

38:10.502 --> 38:12.838
Well, we just got your more
than your severance package.

38:12.872 --> 38:15.374
I suggest you use it
to tide yourself over

38:15.408 --> 38:19.578
till you figure something out.

38:29.589 --> 38:32.658
Stan...Hey.

38:32.693 --> 38:35.294
Your best asset is your mind.

38:35.329 --> 38:38.130
They can't take that from you.

38:38.165 --> 38:39.398
One little mistake.

38:39.433 --> 38:43.468
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

38:43.503 --> 38:45.437
Start over?

38:50.342 --> 38:53.343
I never should have done it.

39:14.499 --> 39:16.633
Told you they wouldn't
catch me.

39:16.668 --> 39:18.602
What are you looking for,
Harvey?

39:18.636 --> 39:20.237
- Positive reinforcement?
- Nothing major.

39:20.271 --> 39:22.271
A trophy,
Nobel.

39:22.306 --> 39:24.841
Would your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

39:24.875 --> 39:27.010
Bust or life-size?

39:27.044 --> 39:29.345
You did a good thing,
Harvey.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.282
Well, it wasn't just me,
you know?

39:32.316 --> 39:34.884
Well, then I guess
I should give the kid

39:34.919 --> 39:38.086
the benefit of the doubt
from now on.

39:38.121 --> 39:41.590
You should.

39:54.871 --> 39:56.239
Well, you'll be happy
to know

39:56.273 --> 39:58.007
that Stan has no idea
what he's gonna do

39:58.041 --> 39:59.175
with the rest of his life.

39:59.209 --> 40:02.445
That doesn't make me happy.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.081
Well, what if I tell you
I have no idea

40:04.115 --> 40:08.186
what I'm doing with mine?

40:08.220 --> 40:12.057
What the hell are we gonna do
when I get caught, Harvey?

40:12.091 --> 40:13.158
You're not gonna get caught.

40:13.192 --> 40:17.228
That's your answer?

40:17.262 --> 40:22.432
What else is there?

40:22.467 --> 40:24.634
Why?

40:24.669 --> 40:25.769
What?

40:25.803 --> 40:27.503
Hire me.
Why would you do that to me?

40:27.538 --> 40:29.738
You mean <i>for</i> you.

40:29.773 --> 40:30.873
No, I don't.

40:30.907 --> 40:31.974
You made it perfectly clear

40:32.008 --> 40:33.141
that you only do things
for yourself.

40:33.176 --> 40:34.476
So why?

40:34.510 --> 40:36.545
You mean the reason why
I became a lawyer

40:36.579 --> 40:39.348
or your friend dealt drugs
or you used to cheat?

40:39.382 --> 40:40.849
I cheated because I needed--

40:40.884 --> 40:41.983
You couldn't make money
any other way?

40:42.018 --> 40:44.553
Bullshit.

40:44.587 --> 40:47.155
Life is this.

40:47.189 --> 40:49.524
I like this.

40:49.558 --> 40:51.058
That's not me.

40:51.093 --> 40:53.428
Well, if it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

40:53.462 --> 40:54.729
So if you want this to stop,

40:54.763 --> 40:57.231
all you got to do is tap out.

41:10.578 --> 41:12.312
- Hello.
- Oh.

41:12.346 --> 41:13.880
You're here to see Mike.

41:13.914 --> 41:15.748
We're gonna celebrate
his victory.

41:15.783 --> 41:19.119
Ah.

41:19.154 --> 41:21.288
You know, I actually think
that it's a really,

41:21.323 --> 41:22.890
really good idea that
you've come to pick him up.

41:22.924 --> 41:24.792
In fact, if I were you,

41:24.826 --> 41:26.060
I'd do it a little
more often.

41:26.095 --> 41:29.197
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel.

41:29.231 --> 41:31.566
What do you mean?

41:31.600 --> 41:33.368
What do I--

41:33.402 --> 41:36.305
Well, come on.
You're a smart girl.

41:36.339 --> 41:38.540
You understand animal behavior.

41:38.574 --> 41:40.242
I think you can
figure it out.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.480
Hey.
You ready?

41:46.514 --> 41:48.649
Yeah.
