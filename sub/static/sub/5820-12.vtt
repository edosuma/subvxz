AMC's "The Walking Dead..."</i>

00:03.602 --> 00:05.729
You're well-equipped,
but your provisions are low.

00:05.849 --> 00:07.569
<i>I'm from a place that's
a lot like this one.</i>

00:07.634 --> 00:09.851
<i>We might be in a position
to help each other.</i>

00:09.937 --> 00:11.219
<i>This is Gregory.</i>

00:11.305 --> 00:12.804
I'm the boss.

00:12.890 --> 00:13.972
They still have Craig.

00:14.091 --> 00:14.806
Negan?

00:14.892 --> 00:15.941
They said they'd
return him to us,

00:16.059 --> 00:17.058
if I delivered a message to you.

00:17.194 --> 00:19.060
<i>You give us supplies,</i>

00:19.146 --> 00:20.346
we'll save Craig and take care

00:20.397 --> 00:21.563
of Negan and the saviors.

00:21.698 --> 00:22.898
Done.

00:22.983 --> 00:25.150
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

00:25.235 --> 00:26.235
We need you to come.

00:26.286 --> 00:26.902
It's gonna be a fight.

00:27.037 --> 00:35.037
Oh, well.

- Hey, Carol.
- Tobin.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.201
You deserve some cookies.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.570
Oh, no, not with
the kids as hungry--

02:42.572 --> 02:45.940
No, there's plenty.
I foraged a lot of acorns.

02:51.548 --> 02:54.115
- They're pink.
- Beets.

02:54.117 --> 02:56.167
- Beets?
- It's what makes them sweet.

02:56.169 --> 02:58.870
Oh.

02:58.872 --> 03:01.623
I never was much
of a beet kind of guy.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.591
Will you just put it
in your mouth, jerk.

03:14.656 --> 03:19.974
They're the best beet and acorn
cookies I've ever eaten.

03:21.645 --> 03:22.977
Are you screwing with me?

03:22.979 --> 03:25.146
No.

03:25.148 --> 03:27.816
Seriously.

03:27.818 --> 03:29.284
They're amazing.

03:29.286 --> 03:31.069
<i>They're back!</i>

03:48.338 --> 03:50.338
- Get Olivia.

03:50.340 --> 03:52.340
She should inventory
what we have.

03:52.342 --> 03:53.612
We'll meet her at the pantry.

03:53.739 --> 03:55.973
- You have food?
- Yeah.

03:55.975 --> 03:59.293
Enough for another month.

03:59.295 --> 04:01.662
<i>I need everybody in
the church in an hour.</i>

04:01.664 --> 04:02.847
What is it?

04:02.849 --> 04:05.249
We'll talk about it.

04:09.388 --> 04:12.139
Rick, what's going on?

04:13.759 --> 04:15.392
We're gonna have to fight.

04:52.265 --> 04:54.682
It's been a while.

04:54.684 --> 04:56.467
Weeks.

04:56.469 --> 04:59.803
- Since what?
- Since we talked.

04:59.805 --> 05:02.189
That's what we did in that cell?
We talked.

05:07.013 --> 05:09.980
Why didn't you tell Rick?

05:09.982 --> 05:13.317
Tara, Rosita, Eugene?

05:13.319 --> 05:17.588
- Why didn't they...?
- I told them to keep quiet about it.

05:17.590 --> 05:19.456
Why?

05:19.458 --> 05:21.992
Can we just forget it,
move past it?

05:24.163 --> 05:25.746
You don't have to carry that.

05:25.748 --> 05:27.331
Carry what?

05:27.333 --> 05:30.000
You know what I did.

05:30.002 --> 05:31.669
You don't want
to tell anyone, it--

05:35.224 --> 05:37.241
it's kind of like
you did it, too.

05:37.243 --> 05:39.727
No, it's not.

05:43.182 --> 05:45.816
Just go.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.360
<i>And we can work
with the Hilltop.</i>

06:51.360 --> 06:53.650
<i>Maggie hammered out a deal.</i>

06:53.650 --> 06:55.720
<i>We're getting food--</i>

06:55.720 --> 06:58.790
<i>eggs, butter, fresh vegetables.</i>

06:58.790 --> 07:02.090
<i>But they're not
just giving it away.</i>

07:02.090 --> 07:04.680
<i>These Saviors,</i>

07:04.680 --> 07:07.930
<i>they almost killed Sasha,
Daryl, and Abraham on the road.</i>

07:07.930 --> 07:10.550
<i>Now, sooner or later,
they would've found us,</i>

07:10.550 --> 07:12.470
<i>just like those Wolves did,</i>

07:12.470 --> 07:14.300
<i>just like Jesus did.</i>

07:14.300 --> 07:17.940
<i>They woulda killed someone
or some of us.</i>

07:17.940 --> 07:20.730
And then they
would try to own us.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.980
And we would try to stop them.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.650
<i>But by then,
in that kind of fight,</i>

07:26.650 --> 07:30.790
<i>low on food, we could lose.</i>

07:30.790 --> 07:32.740
<i>This is the only way to be sure,</i>

07:32.740 --> 07:35.290
<i>as sure as we can get,
that we win.</i>

07:35.290 --> 07:37.740
<i>And we have to win.</i>

07:39.630 --> 07:41.500
<i>We do this for the Hilltop,</i>

07:41.500 --> 07:43.910
it's how we keep this place.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.420
It's how we feed this place.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.670
<i>This needs to be
a group decision.</i>

07:51.670 --> 07:56.310
If anybody objects, here's
your chance to say your piece.

08:05.190 --> 08:07.020
You're sure we can do it?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.690
We can beat them?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.080
What this group has done,
what we've learned,

08:17.080 --> 08:19.200
what we've become,
all of us--

08:19.200 --> 08:21.500
yes, I'm sure.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.700
Then all we have to do
is just tell them that.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.370
<i>Well, they don't compromise.</i>

08:25.380 --> 08:29.180
This isn't a compromise.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.460
It's a choice you give them.

08:31.460 --> 08:33.580
It's a way out,
for them and for us.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.350
<i>We try and
talk to the Saviors,</i>

08:35.350 --> 08:37.650
<i>we give up our advantage,
our safety.</i>

08:37.650 --> 08:42.390
No, we have to come for them
before they come for us.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.810
We can't leave them alive.

08:44.810 --> 08:47.650
Where there's life,
there's possibility.

08:47.650 --> 08:48.980
Of them hitting us.

08:48.980 --> 08:50.700
<i>We're not trapped in this.</i>

08:50.700 --> 08:52.780
None of you are trapped in this.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.840
<i>Morgan...</i>

08:56.840 --> 09:00.120
they always come back.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.580
Come back
when they're dead, too.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.580
Yeah, we'll stop them.
We have before.

09:04.580 --> 09:08.550
I'm not talking
about the walkers.

09:08.550 --> 09:12.000
Morgan wants
to talk to them first.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.590
I think that would be a mistake,

09:14.590 --> 09:16.170
<i>but it's not up to me.</i>

09:16.180 --> 09:17.930
<i>I'll talk to the people
still at home.</i>

09:17.930 --> 09:20.330
<i>I'll discuss it
with the people on guard now, too,</i>

09:20.330 --> 09:25.070
but who else wants to approach
the Saviors, talk to them first?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.770
What happened here,

09:27.770 --> 09:29.520
<i>we won't let that happen again.</i>

09:32.020 --> 09:33.370
I won't.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.320
Looks like it's settled.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.130
<i>We know exactly what this is.</i>

09:52.130 --> 09:55.850
We don't shy from it, we live.

09:57.770 --> 09:59.300
We kill them all.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.980
<i>We don't all have to kill.</i>

10:09.980 --> 10:12.860
But if people
are gonna stay here...

10:15.230 --> 10:16.730
they do have to accept it.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.440
We need someone on the
perimeter keeping watch.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.940
That could be me.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.040
That would be safe.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.340
Safer.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.270
Whatever safer looks like now.

11:24.270 --> 11:25.690
Yeah.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.220
I made that deal.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.810
It wasn't my idea,
but I led us into this.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.200
I have to come.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.820
Those things'll kill you.

11:46.830 --> 11:49.710
You got another one?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.710
Not for you.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.250
And why is that?

11:53.250 --> 11:55.220
'Cause, asshole.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.920
Okay.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.560
Couldn't sleep either?

12:01.560 --> 12:03.510
I never could sleep.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.930
Worried about tomorrow.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.990
You going?

12:14.990 --> 12:17.400
No.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.660
You are.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.650
You can
do things that--

12:27.050 --> 12:29.320
that just terrify me.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.290
How?

12:39.460 --> 12:42.380
How do you think
I do those things?

12:45.690 --> 12:47.970
You're a mom.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.640
I was.

12:51.470 --> 12:54.110
You <i> are.</i>

12:54.110 --> 12:56.060
It-- it--

12:56.060 --> 12:59.950
it's not the cookies
or the smiles.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.780
It's--

13:01.780 --> 13:04.280
it's the hard stuff.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.570
The scary stuff.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.990
It's how you can do it.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.580
It's strength.

13:17.470 --> 13:21.670
You're a mom to most
of the people here.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.060
To you, too?

13:32.580 --> 13:33.980
No.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.850
You're something else to me.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.870
Well, it's not tomorrow yet.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.960
Packing your stilettos?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.300
We'll only be gone a night.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.600
I'm going.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.550
I am, too, but tomorrow.

14:13.140 --> 14:15.440
I'm leaving.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.230
Why?

14:24.230 --> 14:25.980
<i>It happens.</i>

14:29.460 --> 14:31.070
Are you serious?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.770
This is how I want it.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.410
- Why?
- Why are dingleberries brown?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.580
It's just the way shit is.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
No, no. After everything
we've been through,

14:41.580 --> 14:44.420
you are not walking out that
door unless you can tell me why.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.140
Tell me!

14:46.140 --> 14:48.220
Tell me why!

14:48.220 --> 14:50.140
When I first met you,

14:50.140 --> 14:52.980
I thought you were
the last woman on Earth.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.260
You're not.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.120
You try one of these?
They're chewy.

15:24.130 --> 15:26.460
They, uh...

15:26.460 --> 15:27.930
got some fight in them.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.440
<i>Describe it.</i>

15:36.440 --> 15:39.360
Rectangular building,
big satellites on it.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.140
- Rick: <i> Any windows?</i>
- I don't remember any.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.140
I think they made it
so there's only one way in.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.480
<i>Guards outside?</i>

15:46.480 --> 15:48.820
Yeah, two of them, at least.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.030
<i>And you don't know
how many people they have?</i>

15:51.040 --> 15:52.490
No.

15:54.410 --> 15:57.240
Uh, I mean, no. I saw a place
where they stored food.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.880
It wasn't that big, so...

15:58.880 --> 16:01.960
- Rick: <i> You've been inside?</i>
- Yeah.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.830
They had us load in
supplies one time.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.330
Hmm.
What do you remember?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.000
Are you worried?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.670
No.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.890
No, it's just...

16:15.900 --> 16:20.180
I love you, and I just
wanted to say it before--

16:20.180 --> 16:22.680
you don't have to say it back.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.150
It's--

16:24.150 --> 16:27.020
I'll say it when you come back.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.360
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.860
We're gonna leave from there.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.530
Do you want to come?

16:34.530 --> 16:38.080
I mean, I can change it so we
don't leave from the compound.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.620
We could come back and we
could leave from here.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.200
- You know, we're gonna get meds, so...
- I can't.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.210
- No, I didn't-- I'm-- I just-- I need to be here.
- Yeah.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.260
I'm the only doctor now.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.790
So I can't.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.460
Yeah.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.300
But I want to.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.060
I'll tell you
when you come back.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.140
Yeah.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.319
<i>And you didn't
see any other rooms?</i>

17:17.319 --> 17:20.410
No, it's a big place.

17:20.410 --> 17:22.410
This is the hallway I saw.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.079
There is more.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.880
And every time, they had you
bring things into here?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.330
Jesus.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.890
We brought a couple
spears for them.

17:31.890 --> 17:34.390
Two of the Saviors took
them down this hallway.

17:34.390 --> 17:36.340
Now, they must've
done something with them

17:36.340 --> 17:38.180
because they didn't
come back with them.

17:38.180 --> 17:41.090
<i>Maybe a weapons
locker, an armory.</i>

17:41.100 --> 17:42.260
Okay.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.230
We get in there,
secure the armory,

17:45.230 --> 17:47.100
that's how we end it.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.600
That's how Carol ended it here.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.410
But we don't know if they have
an armory or where it even is.

17:56.410 --> 17:59.500
Well, we've got
a lot of good guesses.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.200
We've done more with less.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.500
We go in at night
while they're sleeping.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.290
The guards won't be sleeping.

18:06.290 --> 18:09.120
Like I said, I think
there's only one way in

18:09.120 --> 18:10.340
and there's no way
to bust through that door

18:10.340 --> 18:11.840
<i>without waking up
the rest of them.</i>

18:11.840 --> 18:14.010
We don't need to.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.100
They're going to open it for
us, let us walk right in.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.680
They want Gregory's head, right?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.060
We're gonna give it to them.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.390
Aaron, Rosita.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.640
You start here.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.080
We'll peel off
every quarter mile,

19:01.080 --> 19:04.150
meet back here
in a couple of hours.

19:04.150 --> 19:05.980
See what we got.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.960
There's no turning back now.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.490
I could walk.

19:15.490 --> 19:18.830
Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.

19:18.830 --> 19:20.800
I'm not going anywhere.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.250
I wanted to learn and you
taught me for a reason.

19:26.870 --> 19:29.300
Why are you still wearing that?

19:32.390 --> 19:34.680
It's still who I was.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
I think.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.850
And it'll be harder for
them to see me in the dark.

19:54.530 --> 19:57.030
I almost told everyone
at the meeting.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.540
We're not telling them.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.570
Morgan stood up in that church and
tried to talk us out of this.

20:02.570 --> 20:04.570
What's wrong with that?

20:04.580 --> 20:07.380
Maybe that he didn't know what
the hell he's talking about?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.280
That he should take the win

20:09.280 --> 20:11.010
that we didn't kick his ass out
for hiding that psychopath.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.800
If we told everyone, they'd find
out about Denise, you know that.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.640
That <i> hijo de puta</i>
tried to stand there

20:17.640 --> 20:20.290
and act like we didn't
know what we were--

20:20.290 --> 20:21.860
He doesn't want to kill.

20:21.860 --> 20:24.640
We don't want to kill.
We don't like it.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.830
It happens.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.470
I'm not telling anyone.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.580
What do you think?

21:18.580 --> 21:20.350
Maybe.

21:21.550 --> 21:24.670
If we, um, cut the hair...

21:25.720 --> 21:28.620
<i>trim the beard.</i>

21:28.630 --> 21:30.460
<i>If it's dark.</i>

21:34.880 --> 21:37.600
We're gonna kill those people.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.020
Tonight.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.940
Look, I've been lucky.

21:42.940 --> 21:46.240
I haven't had to do it before.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.140
Have you?

21:48.150 --> 21:51.150
I've been lucky, too.

21:51.150 --> 21:52.410
You nervous?

21:56.650 --> 22:00.710
Have you ever seen
something that, um...

22:00.710 --> 22:03.990
afterwards, you--

22:03.990 --> 22:06.960
you didn't want to sleep

22:06.960 --> 22:10.000
and you weren't hungry because
when you close your eyes

22:10.000 --> 22:11.830
you could see it?

22:13.750 --> 22:16.470
- And when you try to eat--
- Yeah.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.060
Me, too.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.880
Killing somebody has gotta
be worse than that.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.720
It has to be.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.660
So, yeah...

22:34.660 --> 22:36.940
I'm nervous.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.110
For the whole thing, man.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.160
For the whole thing.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.180
We're gonna
take a look around,

22:58.180 --> 23:01.050
try to get a feel for how
many people are in there.

23:02.950 --> 23:07.360
We like how it looks, we go in.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.810
A couple of hours before dawn.

23:10.810 --> 23:13.280
The guards outside'll be tired.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.730
<i>Everyone inside'll be sleeping.</i>

23:18.040 --> 23:21.200
We don't like what we see, we
head back, make a new plan.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.910
They don't know who we are.

23:23.910 --> 23:27.040
<i>We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.</i>

23:27.040 --> 23:28.610
This is how we eat.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.660
This is how we eat.

23:35.590 --> 23:37.640
We roll out at midnight.

23:48.930 --> 23:50.470
Why is Maggie here?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.630
She's guarding the perimeter.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.100
Yeah, but why is she here?

23:55.110 --> 23:57.740
'Cause it's her choice.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.190
I want to stay
out there with her.

23:59.190 --> 24:01.530
Well, this whole thing's
a race to the armory.

24:01.530 --> 24:03.950
We need as many people
inside as we can get.

24:03.950 --> 24:05.280
She shouldn't
be out there alone.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.620
She shouldn't be out here
in the first place.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.020
Okay.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.460
Good.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.600
She's done with the hair?

24:23.600 --> 24:24.970
What've we got?

24:24.970 --> 24:27.300
- That one.
- Yeah, that's it.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.560
<i>All right.</i>

24:31.560 --> 24:34.280
Though, it's probably good
we're doing this at night.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.060
Something wrong with it?

24:38.070 --> 24:41.700
The nose. Gregory's
is a different shape.

24:52.430 --> 24:54.330
He fought back.

24:54.330 --> 24:57.500
He broke your hand, right?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.670
Guess there's no reason
to be subtle about it.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.890
What?

25:05.890 --> 25:08.730
The Saviors, they're scary,

25:08.730 --> 25:10.750
but those pricks
got nothing on you.

25:37.090 --> 25:39.680
<i>Stop right there!</i>

25:39.680 --> 25:41.880
<i>Announce yourself, asshole!</i>

25:41.880 --> 25:43.970
It's Eddie from Hilltop!

25:43.970 --> 25:45.470
It's done!

25:45.470 --> 25:47.550
<i>Step out!</i>

25:59.730 --> 26:01.320
<i>Is that it?</i>

26:01.320 --> 26:03.990
Yeah!

26:03.990 --> 26:06.120
<i>Bring it here, shit brain!</i>

26:21.470 --> 26:24.010
I don't want the bag,
needle dick.

26:36.940 --> 26:42.610
Will you look at this shit?

26:57.340 --> 27:01.130
He broke my hand.
I broke his nose.

27:01.130 --> 27:03.130
That's why he looks that way.

27:24.230 --> 27:26.070
Little bitch broke my nose.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.740
- - Wah.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.170
Okay, looks like you learned.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.380
I'll get your guy,
you'll go home,

27:42.390 --> 27:45.000
and you bring us more
stuff next week, hmm?

28:29.720 --> 28:31.850
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.140
- Ahh!

28:36.140 --> 28:38.390
- It's okay, it's okay.

28:38.390 --> 28:40.310
<i>We're bringing you back.
We're bringing you back.</i>

29:01.550 --> 29:03.920
Check the doors.
Find the arsenal.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.470
We take them out.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.930
You still a priest?

32:38.630 --> 32:41.300
Rick and Carl
taught me about guns,

32:41.300 --> 32:44.970
other weapons.

32:44.970 --> 32:46.720
How to contribute.

32:51.810 --> 32:53.860
I'm still a priest.

33:00.150 --> 33:02.040
I lied to my girlfriend
this morning.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.990
I, um-- she caught me
thinking about something,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.050
so I told her that I loved her.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.670
For the first time.

33:15.670 --> 33:18.590
That's how I told her,
covering something up.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.340
What were you covering?

33:25.930 --> 33:28.560
That I'd done something
like this before.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.680
That I didn't like it.

33:33.990 --> 33:35.740
Do you?

33:39.690 --> 33:41.940
Do you love her?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.780
Yeah.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.420
So, you know what
you're fighting for.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.940
Hmm.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.139
Honeypot.

34:38.130 --> 34:39.550
They're in trouble.
Stay here.

34:39.550 --> 34:41.090
- I'm going with you.
- I said stay here.

34:41.090 --> 34:42.300
No.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.010
Damn it, Maggie.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.980
- I have to.
- No, you don't. You don't have to.

34:46.980 --> 34:48.260
Yes, I do.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.090
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

34:50.100 --> 34:51.679
What am I supposed to do?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.429
You're supposed
to be someone else.

34:58.070 --> 34:59.320
They need our help.

35:12.790 --> 35:14.840
You are staying here.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.350
We need to go. Get them
back to the Hilltop.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.890
What? Your people
could be in trouble.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.690
If you get them back,
the deal's still on, right?

35:30.690 --> 35:32.360
Right?

35:32.360 --> 35:33.690
If they get themselves back.

35:33.690 --> 35:36.530
Andy, drive him
back to the Hilltop.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.070
Look, if they see you
and we don't make it--

35:44.070 --> 35:46.370
We're gonna make it. And
they're not gonna see me.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.740
Are you kidding?

35:56.330 --> 35:58.380
Go!

36:19.770 --> 36:22.020
Ah!

36:24.780 --> 36:27.410
If it wasn't us,
it was gonna be you.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.450
The hell?

36:47.880 --> 36:50.170
That's one of the locked ones.
I'm gonna cover you. Do it.

37:05.070 --> 37:06.790
Come on!

38:35.410 --> 38:38.160
So, this is the next world.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.140
Drop it.

38:49.140 --> 38:52.060
<i>Drop it.</i>

38:52.060 --> 38:54.590
You, uh--

38:54.590 --> 38:56.230
you gonna kill me, Padre?

38:58.400 --> 39:01.520
<i>Padre?</i>

39:01.520 --> 39:03.770
"Let not your heart
be troubled."

39:06.270 --> 39:07.940
You're just as dead as me.

39:07.940 --> 39:11.610
"In my father's house
are many mansions.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.440
If it were not so,
I would've told you."

39:13.450 --> 39:15.780
You're all dead.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.920
- "I go prepare a place for you."
- Blood's coming.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.630
Amen.

39:49.330 --> 39:54.030
Hey, you want to just
come back with us?

39:54.030 --> 39:56.730
Take a couple days before
you and Tara go out again?

39:56.730 --> 40:00.150
No, man. I just want
to get out of here.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.050
What is it?

41:24.490 --> 41:25.990
Just--

41:28.040 --> 41:30.790
just want to know which
one of them was Negan.

41:35.830 --> 41:37.370
Son of a bitch!

41:48.760 --> 41:50.110
Where'd you get the bike?

41:52.180 --> 41:54.550
Just do it!

41:54.550 --> 41:56.570
Like you did
everyone else, right?

41:58.350 --> 42:02.070
<i>Lower your gun, prick.</i>

42:02.080 --> 42:04.590
<i>You, with the Colt Python.</i>

42:04.590 --> 42:06.910
<i>All of you, lower your
weapons right now.</i>

42:15.420 --> 42:18.340
Come on out.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.760
Let's talk.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.210
<i>We're not coming
out, but we will talk.</i>

42:26.880 --> 42:29.220
<i>We've got a
Carol and a Maggie.</i>

42:29.220 --> 42:31.700
<i>I'm thinking that's something
you want to chat about.</i>
