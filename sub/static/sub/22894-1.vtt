HIDDEN RESERVES

01:55.480 --> 01:57.437
<i>Starting identification.</i>

02:01.600 --> 02:03.831
<i>Identification confirmed.</i>

02:04.480 --> 02:06.278
<i>Have a safe journey.</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:19.117
- Excuse me, Mr. Baumann. I must ask you...
- Biometric scan?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.710
The threat level is now "substantial".

03:22.960 --> 03:26.874
Vincent Baumann, insurance agent,
death insurance field sales.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.273
Thanks for your trouble.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.832
<i>Body temperature falling.</i>

03:45.040 --> 03:48.112
<i>36.1 degrees Celsius.</i>

03:50.000 --> 03:53.311
<i>36.0 degrees Celsius.</i>

03:54.760 --> 03:57.753
<i>35.9 degrees Celsius.</i>

04:01.080 --> 04:03.754
<i>Initiating vital signs simulation.</i>

04:33.920 --> 04:35.798
<i>- Identity check.</i>
- Stop!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.071
- Hands behind your heads!
<i>- Remove the masks!</i>

04:40.000 --> 04:41.320
Mask off!

04:41.520 --> 04:45.150
<i>Suspicion of assisted suicide
and manipulating vital signs.</i>

04:46.240 --> 04:47.151
Against the fence!

04:47.440 --> 04:50.751
<i>Suspicion of assisted suicide
and manipulating vital signs.</i>

04:51.600 --> 04:52.875
<i>Identity check.</i>

05:01.240 --> 05:02.833
29.5 degrees Celsius and falling.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.953
Initiate emergency resuscitation
and life support! Prevent cooldown!

05:09.240 --> 05:13.120
- Put into permanent vegetative state.
- No! Let her die!

05:13.400 --> 05:15.312
- Credit negative!
- Mother!

05:15.600 --> 05:17.159
No death insurance.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.760
Mother!

05:20.080 --> 05:21.958
- Stop!
- Against the fence!

05:39.200 --> 05:43.319
Most people repress thoughts of death,
yet death means peace.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.038
See what'll happen
if you die in debt, Mr. Karner?

05:51.240 --> 05:54.438
You'll be kept alive artificially
to pay off your debts.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.759
We all have capacities
that can be activated after natural death.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.113
Even if your organs or motor functions
are useless, they'll find a use for you.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.360
In the data center, perhaps.
The brain is an excellent storage medium.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.236
Your profile tells me
you base your actions on reason.

06:11.440 --> 06:15.912
You know you can never entirely eliminate
the risk of dying with debt.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.956
You can be totally secure about death
only if you purchase death insurance.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.950
More heavy breathing.
Karner has a fear of suffocation.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.753
You've got it.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.320
You should get the policy now,
while you're still of sound mind.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.399
Moreover,
I can offer you the best rate right now.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.397
Only our personalized coverage package
guarantees

06:39.600 --> 06:44.197
that you won't spend your retirement
in a permanent vegetative state.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.157
<i>Identity uploaded.</i>

07:11.760 --> 07:13.353
Stop!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.832
<i>Verifying identity.</i>

07:23.040 --> 07:24.713
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

07:24.920 --> 07:27.196
Okay. Move along.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.840
- They got Chris and Frank.
- I know. And you? Are you all right?

08:29.520 --> 08:31.273
Someone must've betrayed us.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.039
No one else knew about the operation.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.755
I'm worried about Chris and Frank.
They'll pressure them.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.633
Unless we get them out in time.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.830
We'll never get in without proper IDs.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.760
- I have to.
- Can you manage it today?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.874
My contact is out there.
I can't back out now.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.560
Lisa!

09:08.840 --> 09:11.674
- May I get you a drink?
- Something to celebrate?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.837
Whenever I see you, yes.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.032
You wanted identities.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.993
ID, Verification Level 2.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.839
Philip, I need 3+.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.560
I can't procure those.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.959
Suppose I could get you Level 3 IDs,
would you come with me?

09:32.880 --> 09:35.395
Where to? To the parallel society?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.917
- This is the parallel society.
- From your point of view.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.194
Give me two days and you'll have them.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.030
Vincent, please!

10:20.240 --> 10:23.756
You don't want to end up
as data storage, Mrs. Hoffmansthal.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.636
- You don't mince words.
- I want to spare you Geriatrics.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.071
The first generation, she was your age.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.433
She is now 102 and won't be detached
from the tubes for another 98 years.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.279
You deserve to find peace.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.480
When the time comes.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.832
Vincent,
I don't want to think about dying now.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.840
Call it peace in the beyond.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.397
You think only of business.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.198
If you'd like to sleep on it,
I won't pressure you.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.471
No, let's finalize it now.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.277
Payment in instalments or...

10:58.280 --> 11:00.158
a one-time lump sum?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.110
<i>Diana Dorn, leave a message.</i>

11:04.400 --> 11:06.073
Hoffmansthal finalized.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.759
So you finalized Hoffmansthal.
Congrats.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.520
You had bad luck with her.
That happens.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.031
Not to you.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.352
I work with the profiles she gives us,
just as you do.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.712
Vincent, can you swap
one of your profiles with me?

11:37.440 --> 11:40.638
- I get only useless ones.
- The profiles aren't to blame.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.838
People sense you need to close
to secure a living for you and your wife.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.159
- Dietrich, you sweat. Clients smell that.
- I need to close a deal.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.031
Then reel him in, this Sokulov.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.995
- If they demote me, it'll be...
<i>- Wladimir Sokulov speaking.</i>

11:57.200 --> 11:59.476
Mr. Sokulov, I'm glad I reached you.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.434
This call could alter your life,
or your death.

12:02.640 --> 12:06.316
Your ASV number is 42148914.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.480
Our profile analysis
shows you are slightly underinsured

12:10.760 --> 12:12.877
for accidents and death.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.549
- That's distracting.
<i>- Get to the point!</i>

12:15.760 --> 12:17.399
Sorry. I'm back with you.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.672
Without a death insurance policy, you...

12:27.040 --> 12:29.919
- Congratulations.
- Your profile was perfect.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.796
- Teamwork.
- Down to the music. <i>Forever and ever...</i>

12:36.040 --> 12:39.511
- Why is everyone so tense?
- Data sets were manipulated.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.475
- A mole in our department?
- Our outside informants are at risk.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.999
- Keep that to yourself for now.
- Copy that.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.638
I'll see you later.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.840
A power outage
of at least 15 hours is required

13:00.040 --> 13:03.590
for them to cool down
to where they can no longer vegetate

13:03.800 --> 13:05.917
and become economically useless.

13:06.120 --> 13:10.637
At a body temperature of below 20 degrees,
even resuscitation is futile.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.635
And that means that they can die.

13:13.840 --> 13:18.198
As with everything else, Geriatrics
is secured against power failure.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.995
But not against the unlikely event

13:21.280 --> 13:22.919
of three incidents at once.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.077
That would have a cascade effect

13:25.280 --> 13:29.672
and trigger a power supply shutdown
throughout the sector.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.672
Geriatrics would be shut down
for 48 hours as well.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.759
The emergency generators
are the real problem.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.270
They can only be manipulated on-site,

13:39.480 --> 13:42.678
and that means
at least one of us must go in there.

13:42.880 --> 13:48.000
I'll get Level 3 identity verification
from my contact by tomorrow night.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.591
That will give us
unrestricted access to all sectors.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.951
<i>Diana Dorn, leave a message.</i>

13:56.560 --> 13:58.040
Karner finalized.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.395
- What's up?
- I was rammed. Second time this week.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.717
- Activists?
- Who else?

14:51.920 --> 14:54.560
- Is everything under control?
- Of course.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.797
- Is the deputy there as well?
- Yes.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.151
He's very keen to promote you.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.950
Your profile shows
you are not committed to

15:08.160 --> 15:09.879
or responsible for anyone.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.595
Depends how you define responsibility.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.553
Children, for example.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.639
What relevance do children have to you?

15:17.840 --> 15:21.914
Necessary for the preservation of society,
yet also a risk.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.191
Imaginable at a reasonable time.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.596
Depending on the profile, of course.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.554
I assume you know about
the leak in our department.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.752
Yes, I informed him.

15:31.960 --> 15:37.115
Then you'll understand that verifying
employee loyalty is our top priority.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.191
We welcome your wish for promotion,

15:40.400 --> 15:43.916
yet it means you're no longer content
in your current job.

15:44.120 --> 15:48.114
Thus, you'll be unable
to do it satisfactorily in the future

15:48.400 --> 15:52.519
as you'll no longer be as motivated
as younger contenders.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.270
So you will be demoted
if your request is not granted.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.676
- You are aware of that?
- Yes.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.196
Mr. Baumann, what do you expect
from Internal Service?

16:04.160 --> 16:05.560
Equilibrium.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.677
<i>Oxytocin level climbing.</i>

16:11.160 --> 16:13.152
<i>Progesterone flow constant.</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:15.393
<i>Estrogen level constant.</i>

16:15.600 --> 16:19.753
<i>Testosterone concentration
nine nanograms per milliliter</i>

16:19.960 --> 16:21.872
<i>Adrenaline level attained.</i>

16:22.080 --> 16:25.118
<i>Endorphin production 20 percent...</i>

16:26.440 --> 16:28.193
<i>25 percent...</i>

16:28.400 --> 16:31.438
<i>Maximum oxytocin circulation.</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:33.632
<i>Dopamine release ensuing.</i>

16:34.440 --> 16:37.478
<i>Serotonin production 97 percent.</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:41.276
<i>Equilibrium attained.</i>

16:53.560 --> 16:55.199
Stay away from Dietrich.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.075
What?

16:57.280 --> 16:59.078
His company is beneath you now.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.394
I keep no company.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.474
Then I wonder why you didn't report it.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.590
What?

17:06.800 --> 17:10.031
That Dietrich asked you
to swap profiles with him.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.270
Vincent!

17:23.640 --> 17:24.960
Philip.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.311
- I'm back.
- Congratulations.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.960
<i>Profiling Manager Diana Dorn.</i>

17:44.400 --> 17:47.518
I'm sorry to inform you
that management

17:47.800 --> 17:50.076
has parted with a longtime employee.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.033
Mr. Dietrich was demoted.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.358
Yet I am delighted
that we could replace him

17:55.560 --> 17:57.677
with an experienced colleague.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.156
Allow me to introduce Philip Kessler.

18:00.360 --> 18:04.274
I expect you all to make
every effort you can to assist him.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.880
Thank you.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.153
May I?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.635
Sentimental?

18:16.840 --> 18:18.240
By no means.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.240
A gift.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.158
Is he leaving you in the lurch?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.676
- Where are you going?
- To his place.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.352
- Philip?
- Who is it?

18:50.240 --> 18:53.517
- I'm looking for Philip Kessler.
- No Kessler here.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.872
- What do you want?
- Where is he?

19:02.480 --> 19:05.439
- Uh... Now listen...
- Where's Kessler?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.120
Who?

19:07.320 --> 19:10.313
- Kessler.
- We just moved in here.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.433
- How did you get in here?
- It was allotted to us.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.793
- By whom?
- The insurance company, European All Risk.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.198
We don't know where this Kessler is
and have no contact to him.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.915
We'd really like to unpack in peace.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.389
The corporation put them up here.
That can't be a coincidence.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.797
What exactly did you tell Kessler?

19:37.520 --> 19:39.557
He knows nothing about our plan.

19:41.200 --> 19:45.672
How far did you have to go
to get him to provide you with identities?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.917
Gerhard, you set me onto him.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.834
He promised you a Level 3 identity.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.679
Just like that?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.998
He found out nothing from me
about us or our mission.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.159
And now I'm going to see
if there's a link here.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.040
<i>Hello, what can I do for you?</i>

20:52.240 --> 20:55.551
I'd like to transfer
this death policy to my unborn child.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.240
Dietrich.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.272
<i>Please double-check the data.</i>

21:02.880 --> 21:04.439
<i>And confirm it.</i>

21:06.760 --> 21:09.355
<i>Processing transfer of insurance.</i>

21:44.400 --> 21:47.154
- Him, and you go into Internal Service.
- Wladimir Sokulov.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.432
- Isn't he Dietrich's...
- His suicide is unrelated.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.030
Was Dietrich in on the data manipulation?

21:53.240 --> 21:57.393
Before jumping he signed over
his death insurance to his unborn child.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.640
And he thought he'd evade responsibility
by being squashed.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.480
- His wife is pregnant?
- Management needs this deal.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.272
A self-made man from the East,
with ties to management and the board.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.358
Widower, one daughter.

22:14.480 --> 22:19.430
She lives in the satellite, voluntarily,
no special status. Is she an activist?

22:21.120 --> 22:23.715
You weren't just there.
You tailed him.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.116
Him recognizing me wasn't chance.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.233
The corporation sent him.
What was his task?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.511
Task? What are you talking about?

22:32.760 --> 22:36.720
- He was demoted.
- Did he get into trouble?

22:38.680 --> 22:43.072
They only assigned him to people
they knew wouldn't sign a contract.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.077
Was he given any contacts here?

22:46.360 --> 22:51.310
Whatever schemes you may be involved in,
my husband had no part in them.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.154
They say everyone's responsible
for his own life,

22:55.360 --> 22:58.956
then they send him after people
like that snob.

23:00.040 --> 23:04.114
If anyone's to blame for
my husband's death, it's his employers.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.871
Or clients, like that Mr. Sokulov.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.757
The Lisa Sokulowa file, please.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.597
Typical corporation childhood.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.034
Well-protected in the security zone.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.198
WAS VODKA A FACTOR?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.959
FAMILY TRAGEDY ON WEEKEND

23:35.240 --> 23:37.880
Was the daughter
part of Dietrich's sales strategy?

23:38.080 --> 23:42.233
I supply the profiles, Vincent.
You determine strategy yourselves.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.671
He didn't coordinate that with me.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.910
His daughter.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.151
Put both profiles next to each other.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.318
She has death insurance, he doesn't.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.156
Yes?

24:19.360 --> 24:22.512
Baumann, insurance agent.
I have an appointment.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.757
Please wait a moment.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.799
- Don't smoke so much.
- Don't sidestep me.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.357
You're evading responsibility,
as you did with Mom.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.313
Now that's unfair.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.070
After all, you exploited her condition.
For profit.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.952
Speak German to me.

25:12.520 --> 25:17.276
One cannot behave healthily
in a sick environment.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.439
That you helped create.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.597
Now you're blaming me for something
I'm not responsible for.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.316
I know, you had nothing to do
with the further development.

25:29.520 --> 25:33.230
You went into seclusion.
You can afford to do that.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.036
I always considered it my responsibility

25:37.240 --> 25:39.118
to keep you out of it.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.032
Something I obviously failed to do.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.872
And I consider it my responsibility
to intervene and help these people.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.710
Why do you expose yourself to all that?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.151
Why do you think? Because of you.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.351
Sorry.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.239
I'm well insured, if that eases your mind.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.033
Against pain?

26:13.800 --> 26:15.792
Mr. Sokulov will see you now.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.680
Yes, certainly.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.678
They have an unquenchable thirst.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.835
Baumann, death insurance coverage.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.673
Smell that.

27:05.280 --> 27:08.876
- Nutmeg.
- The smell keeps pests away.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.914
And to us it is intoxicating.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.432
May I offer you something, Mr. Baumann?

27:15.640 --> 27:17.040
No thank you.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.872
Thank you, Nikolai.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.676
I assume you know my profile.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.110
You made an enviable fortune
developing IT security systems.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.312
You're a widower with a daughter.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.354
She is attractive, feisty,
married three times

27:33.560 --> 27:35.677
to circumvent residency rules.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.477
Suspected of ties to activists.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.911
I thought you were here about me

27:43.200 --> 27:45.635
and now this is about my daughter?

27:45.840 --> 27:49.277
It surprised me that you took out
death insurance for your daughter

27:49.480 --> 27:50.800
but not yourself.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.320
May I?

27:55.280 --> 28:00.480
As you know, highly-qualified debtors
are often used as visionaries after death.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.516
Their abilities as mediums
surpass those of GPS systems.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.633
And they're invaluable agents
for information

28:07.840 --> 28:10.799
that cannot be preserved
via traditional means.

28:12.640 --> 28:17.078
We all have a store of mental data
that exceeds our conscious knowledge.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.318
That data can be tapped into and decoded.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.313
Let's assume,
please allow me this hypothesis,

28:25.520 --> 28:28.240
your daughter had contact with activists.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.878
Then, as a visionary, your empathy for her
would put us on her trail,

28:33.160 --> 28:37.518
tip us off to potential illegal activities
and help us preempt them.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.993
Don't waste your time.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.079
I won't be blackmailed with hypotheses.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.390
What you're showing me here
was once called torture.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.719
And its benefit is
no less questionable now than it was then.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.230
You cannot deny
the benefit of preserving vital functions

28:57.440 --> 29:00.638
for uses no one would agree to
of their own free will.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.391
As a surrogate mother, for example.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.277
I'm hardly suitable for that.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.997
I'm speaking of your daughter.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.476
We both know she is rebellious.

29:23.680 --> 29:28.436
If she finds out that you took out
death insurance for her against her will

29:28.640 --> 29:32.600
she's very likely to transfer
the policy to someone else in need.

29:34.120 --> 29:38.160
I see that you've studied
our profiles in great detail.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.919
And you're right.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.352
Lisa is not concerned
about her own security,

29:44.320 --> 29:46.516
but about the right to die.

29:48.640 --> 29:53.840
Whether you treat the knowledge
of my daughter's insurance with discretion

29:54.040 --> 29:55.952
is up to you.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.714
I won't be blackmailed with that.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.079
You see, Mr. Baumann, I built my fortune

30:05.280 --> 30:07.840
on people's mistrust.

30:09.160 --> 30:12.790
In the meantime, however, I have realized

30:13.000 --> 30:15.469
that true worth

30:16.560 --> 30:17.994
resides in trust.

30:19.080 --> 30:23.950
I am beginning to feel gratitude
towards you and your colleagues.

30:24.160 --> 30:28.393
You've accomplished what seemed impossible
to me in recent years.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.680
I am beginning to understand my daughter.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.994
Mr. Baumann, goodbye.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.159
Sokulov, not finalized.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.598
I don't know what happened.
Finding his daughter there threw me off.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.918
<i>In any case,
nothing worked as per profile.</i>

30:56.600 --> 30:58.478
You had your chance, Vincent.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.279
You know what must be done.

31:48.720 --> 31:53.556
Due to your sensitive area of operation
I must take some security precautions.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.394
Would you please?

32:03.360 --> 32:07.434
Please don't take it personally
that we have to reprogram your RFID chip.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.916
You'll be equipped appropriately
for your new challenges.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.832
You'll have no access
to company electronics and servers.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.317
Your communication tools
will be run externally.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.399
Personal access will be restricted.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.638
Your ID verification
will be set back to Level 1.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.152
From now on you'll receive no salary,
only commissions.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.555
<i>Resetting ID verification...</i>

32:34.760 --> 32:38.834
You'll still solicit new clients,
but will not close contracts.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.793
Your work is merely a cover.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.310
What we need are informers.

32:43.520 --> 32:48.754
You're trained in operational psychology,
making you ideal for their recruitment.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.952
We want the activists, Vincent.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.918
This immunizes you against sensory
impressions that cause culture shock.

33:05.960 --> 33:10.637
I'll give you a ration of emergency vials
of Desens CHK4-47 to take orally.

33:10.840 --> 33:14.880
Take it in situations
you feel you can't cope with emotionally.

33:16.640 --> 33:21.157
For negative impressions, but also
for ones that seem positive at first.

33:21.360 --> 33:25.718
Culture shock can damage
the nervous system and be lethal.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.470
<i>Dr. Fischer,
please proceed to Neurosurgery.</i>

33:55.800 --> 33:57.280
Bastard! Get lost!

34:09.520 --> 34:11.751
Welcome to the other side.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.232
The cars are back there.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.480
Come on.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.389
- Reisinger?
- Here. Nationwide, theft.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.474
Here, take it.

34:26.040 --> 34:29.237
- Janovski?
- Yes. General Insurer, social security.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.760
- The little one.
- There?

34:30.960 --> 34:34.670
- Yeah. Zuberer?
- Yes. Union, liability.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.952
Over there, the van.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.710
- Baumann, European All Risk, death.
- Enjoy the ride.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.112
West Sector 3, Settlement N,
Apartment Block 207, Number 449.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.676
<i>The route has been calculated.</i>

34:55.239 --> 34:59.200
<i>Follow the road
for another 1.5 kilometers</i>

34:59.400 --> 35:01.471
<i>and then take a left-hand turn.</i>

35:02.400 --> 35:03.880
Money! Give me money!

35:04.080 --> 35:06.197
- Give it here! Stop!
- Money!

35:07.360 --> 35:09.352
- The next one!
- Block him!

35:13.400 --> 35:18.270
<i>Drive straight for 200 meters
and then turn left.</i>

35:21.880 --> 35:24.759
<i>Turn left 100 meters ahead.</i>

35:24.960 --> 35:27.156
RIGHT TO DIE

35:27.640 --> 35:29.472
<i>Turn left.</i>

35:29.680 --> 35:31.876
Get lost! Die!

35:34.680 --> 35:36.911
<i>You've missed the turn off.</i>

35:37.440 --> 35:40.035
<i>Next possibility, turn left.</i>

35:42.000 --> 35:46.472
<i>West Sector 3,
Settlement N, Apartment Block 207.</i>

35:46.680 --> 35:48.717
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

38:08.400 --> 38:09.834
Water please.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.560
What brings you to the backward sectors?

38:42.760 --> 38:45.958
After admiring your show
I'm tempted to say you.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.995
- One of your sales lines?
- Even I have time off.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.874
- Spending it here?
- I was transferred.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.471
- Demoted for not swaying your dad.
- Excuse my lack of pity.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.595
Have you ever considered death insurance?

39:00.800 --> 39:02.519
My entire life.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.600
Chris!

39:23.760 --> 39:25.160
Lisa!

39:26.200 --> 39:27.759
I made it out.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.119
They put Frank to...

39:38.160 --> 39:41.232
They killed him
and reanimated him as a visionary.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.157
You have to get him out of there.

39:45.560 --> 39:49.395
- In a week they'll have him ready.
- What else did you find out?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.230
Then they plan on using him to find us.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.913
We have to get Chris out of here
without the guy out there noticing.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.351
Can you manage to get rid of him?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.949
You'll have it tough finding friends.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.880
It's obvious
you're an insurance salesman.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.960
- Sorry, insurance agent.
- Who says I want to meet people?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.595
Then what are you looking for here?

40:23.800 --> 40:27.840
- I hoped to hear you sing again.
- Two compliments in one evening.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.633
Highly suspicious.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.116
I quit.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.360
- Now you're starting again on my account?
- How's your father?

40:37.520 --> 40:42.720
Still working? This is still about
my father's insurance and you want me...

40:42.920 --> 40:46.311
I want him to sign off, yes.
But that's not why I'm here.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.319
I know not to expect your help
in that matter.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.319
Does it say that in my profile?

40:52.960 --> 40:55.680
- Are you going to sing again?
- Tomorrow.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.036
You coming?

41:30.960 --> 41:32.235
Hello, Lisa.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.713
- Is she here?
- She's waiting.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.515
- Everything ready?
- Yes, ready for pickup.

FAMILY TRAGEDY ON WEEKEND
ALEXANDRA SOKULOWA'S MYSTERIOUS END

43:49.240 --> 43:51.232
He's back again. Table 3.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.232
We found out
that he really was demoted.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.911
Company loyalty wanes in such times.
This is our chance.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.832
So you want me to bait him?

44:02.040 --> 44:03.679
We're running out of time.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.880
<i>Hello?</i>

49:40.560 --> 49:41.880
<i>Diana?</i>

49:42.080 --> 49:43.355
Lisa.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.036
<i>Oh!</i>

49:45.320 --> 49:46.834
Am I disturbing you?

49:47.400 --> 49:49.551
<i>No, not at all. I'm surprised.</i>

49:50.920 --> 49:54.755
- Prepare to be disappointed.
<i>- Am I banned from the Casanova Bar?</i>

49:54.960 --> 49:57.350
On the contrary, I want a date with you.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.919
A business date, that is.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.789
<i>- So you do want to conclude a contract?</i>
- How risky is it for my father?

50:05.080 --> 50:07.993
I mean,
to be underinsured if he dies?

50:08.200 --> 50:11.830
<i>Well, if an unfavorable chain
of events occurs...</i>

50:12.040 --> 50:14.271
And what sum are we talking about?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.720
<i>You want to buy him
a death insurance contract?</i>

50:17.920 --> 50:20.594
He's my father,
and you need to close on him.

50:24.360 --> 50:28.912
<i>To be honest, I doubt you have the funds
to pay your father's policy rate.</i>

50:29.720 --> 50:33.999
<i>- You'd have to switch milieus.</i>
- Are you saying I should go back? No!

50:34.800 --> 50:39.272
<i>- Then you'll have to sway him.</i>
- No one can sway him, as you should know.

50:39.480 --> 50:41.312
You have to blackmail him.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.679
<i>What do you mean?</i>

50:43.880 --> 50:47.715
Since my mother's death
he's wanted to get me death insurance.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.997
I could agree,
provided that he insures himself too.

51:01.760 --> 51:04.559
Mr. Baumann? Are you still there?

51:07.480 --> 51:08.880
<i>Ms. Sokulova,</i>

51:09.760 --> 51:11.240
<i>you are insured.</i>

51:11.520 --> 51:12.920
What?

51:13.120 --> 51:14.952
By my father?

51:18.960 --> 51:22.078
- Void the policy.
<i>- You know what that means for you?</i>

51:22.800 --> 51:24.951
Can I transfer the policy to him?

51:25.920 --> 51:27.240
<i>Theoretically, yes.</i>

51:28.200 --> 51:30.431
<i>But I ask you not to rush into that.</i>

52:01.240 --> 52:02.993
Thanks for coming.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.273
I got the painkillers.
I got sedatives as well.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.716
You have to promise me, Lisa...

52:24.760 --> 52:26.513
when the time comes

52:26.720 --> 52:28.871
I don't want to be put in Geriatrics.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.992
They'll make a visionary of me.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.953
You can't let that happen!

52:33.720 --> 52:36.189
- I won't let it happen.
- Promise me!

52:36.880 --> 52:39.520
Or you'll have to hire meat grinders.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.518
We'll manage it without them.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.393
I promise you that.

52:56.760 --> 53:02.711
<i>Lisa Sokulova's death insurance, class A3,
is transferred to Christopher Kowalski.</i>

53:03.280 --> 53:04.475
<i>D-.</i>

53:04.680 --> 53:09.118
<i>Due to the credit rating risk
this downgrade means a loss of 12 points.</i>

53:10.280 --> 53:12.954
<i>Please double-check the data and confirm.</i>

53:13.160 --> 53:16.119
<i>Processing transfer of insurance.</i>

53:17.120 --> 53:20.113
<i>Credit affirmative.
Death insurance present.</i>

53:20.320 --> 53:21.720
<i>Withdraw!</i>

53:57.040 --> 53:58.554
She did what?

53:59.200 --> 54:01.874
I thought
she wanted to transfer it to her father.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.320
Sokulov? There've been new developments.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.400
<i>Just after 2:00 p.m. a tragic collision
occurred in the city.</i>

54:09.600 --> 54:12.240
<i>Wladimir Sokulov lost control of his car.</i>

54:12.440 --> 54:14.591
Just like what happened to his wife.

54:14.880 --> 54:20.399
<i>His sedan hit eight-year old Sebastian M.,
who died at the scene.</i>

54:20.600 --> 54:25.880
<i>Rescue workers recovered Wladimir Sokulov
and took him to the public trauma center.</i>

54:26.080 --> 54:30.233
- Did they seize the car electronics?
- Investigations are ongoing.

54:30.520 --> 54:34.992
- But he had accident insurance.
- He injured others through his own fault.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.796
That makes this
a clear case of underinsurance.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.559
And now?

54:42.160 --> 54:45.198
- What'll happen to him?
- He's sedated due to injuries.

54:45.480 --> 54:49.156
Till the extent of fault is determined
his accounts are blocked,

54:49.360 --> 54:52.353
all payments halted
and his property sealed off.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.520
Congratulations.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.678
You've made an example of him.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.554
Vincent, no conspiracy theories, please.

55:01.840 --> 55:06.073
He provoked us,
but would we go to all that effort? No.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.080
- His daughter will...
- Yes, his daughter.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.317
Make no more mistakes with her.

55:11.520 --> 55:13.557
If you hope to come back here,

55:13.760 --> 55:17.549
you must regain her trust,
get closer to her, deliver results.

55:17.840 --> 55:22.551
To that end, your ID verification level
will be raised back to 3+ at once.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.153
Exploit that leeway.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.839
I have nothing to do with it.

55:51.520 --> 55:53.876
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

55:54.080 --> 55:57.118
- Calling it that is...
- I'm sticking to the official version.

55:57.320 --> 56:01.473
- But you know the unofficial version?
- If I did, I wouldn't be here.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.991
- If you had insured your father...
- That was your plan.

56:05.200 --> 56:08.113
As soon as I transferred
my policy to someone else

56:08.400 --> 56:10.995
my father became an insurance case.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.792
My father is still alive.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.634
Insure him now.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.354
I can't do that.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.873
Then stay out of my way.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.714
The watch. What do you want for the watch?

56:46.960 --> 56:48.360
Then forget it.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.680
There's no excuse for your deceitfulness.

57:21.960 --> 57:25.920
- And no basis for your presumption.
- You're tailing me.

57:26.120 --> 57:28.316
You're on-site at task force raids.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.910
You let me think
your dad was getting it.

57:31.120 --> 57:34.909
Someone else needed my insurance urgently.
And you initiated that.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.839
No, not me.

57:38.560 --> 57:40.472
I'm supposed to believe you?

57:40.680 --> 57:42.080
Yes.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.198
I assumed you were desensitized.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.200
Don't leave.

59:01.720 --> 59:03.871
Lie down with me again.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.834
- That's gaining trust?
- I was to get close to her.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.556
And risk a culture shock.
She tricked you, Vincent.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.070
What did she use my identity for?

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.875
We now know what she was after.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.753
3+ identities.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.951
- I'll get her.
- Leave her be.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.358
Act sore, but stay on her.
We want the entire cell.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.954
That ID theft
definitely cost us our contact.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.676
And you did that
just to get him out of the trauma center.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.111
You're undermining our plan.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.077
- Gerhard, he's my father.
- Yes. You saved him from Geriatrics.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.398
Thus, jeopardizing
our plan to switch it off!

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.990
To you, Geriatrics symbolizes our foes.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.954
But this is about people
and their right to die.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.469
If we don't act in the next few days
we won't be able to help anymore.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.433
The contact isn't lost yet.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.196
I'll get him, Baumann.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.999
- It took a bit longer.
- That doesn't matter.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.229
Go out the back, we're being watched.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.320
Bye.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.560
Now you know
what I used your identity for.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.520
Father!

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.800
<i>Localize final phase positioning signal.</i>

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.878
You can't go over there.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.800
- Getting yourself arrested won't save him.
<i>- Determine identity.</i>

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.393
Start emergency resuscitation
and initiate life-preserving measures!

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.990
Bring into permanent vegetative state.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.311
You can be relied on, Vincent.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.791
- If you'd left her to the task force...
- Why didn't you say she got Sokulov out?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.677
Find out what they're planning.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.079
Don't give up now,
not so near the end.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.118
Lisa, I didn't call them in.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.437
I didn't know
about the task force operation.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.919
Sure, you have nothing to do with that
or my father's accident.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.113
You stalk me,
yet have nothing to do with anything.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.834
They used me.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.750
- Used...
- You used me too.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:33.234
If everyone uses you,
you need to decide what you really want.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.712
I'm supposed to deliver you.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.754
They know you have plans.
I'm to inform them.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.158
Cargo check okay. Let him pass. Drive on!

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.840
They bring them here,
pre-assigned according to qualification:

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.432
visionaries, surrogate mothers,
data storage, spare organ warehouse.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:02.910
And how do you know
your father will be loaded here as well?

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.240
You have only ever seen all of this
on your screens, as video images.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.680
Why don't you go see
for yourself for once?

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.112
<i>Contamination alarm!</i>

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:27.912
<i>Foreign element located.</i>

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:30.193
<i>Inspect the vehicle.</i>

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.635
<i>Begin identification of individuals.</i>

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.352
<i>Contamination alarm!</i>

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.233
<i>Foreign element located.</i>

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.991
<i>Begin identification of individuals.</i>

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.957
<i>Verify identity.</i>

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.840
Dietrich?

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.279
Dietrich!

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.120
Identify yourself!

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.719
- Insurance agent Baumann.
- You were localized.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.160
Valid ID. Verification Level 3+.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.238
- System error.
- That can happen.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.877
- Keep out of the transport zone limits.
- Copy!

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.360
Withdraw!

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.313
Let's go.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.439
Nothing there at all.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.956
No expression, no stirring.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.800
Void.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.319
Feelings, perhaps.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.200
Yes, perhaps.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.040
Perhaps a remnant of consciousness
that can't be communicated.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.350
They say there isn't one,
but, to be honest, we don't know.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.120
I can't let them exploit my father
in that state for years and years.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.396
You won't manage to get him out of there.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.240
Visionaries are kept in strict isolation.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.637
It isn't just about my father.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.075
You want to cool down Geriatrics entirely
and need my identity?

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.680
3+.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.833
You can have it.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.274
On one condition.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.951
That you're not the one who goes in.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.352
I'd like to show you something.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.753
Vincent, come on. It's about to start.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.993
You wanted to show me this?

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.553
I used to come here often.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.600
As a child.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.913
Would you come over with me?

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.360
Where to?

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.479
To the parallel society?

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.957
You can't even go back by yourself.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.876
It would be a prospect, with you.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.758
You stay here.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.360
With me.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.919
And if it doesn't work?

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.519
Then we tried.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.678
I want to be part of it.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.679
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, one hundred.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.472
Not the best time
to close your accounts, Mr. Baumann.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.751
I didn't pick it myself.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.756
You don't know me. Vincent Baumann.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.431
- A friend of Dietrich's.
- I know who you are.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.837
- For you.
- I don't want it.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.312
Then take it for your child.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.272
Mr. Baumann, I really can't.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.958
Baumann closed his account.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.560
I know.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.470
Last night he was in the transport zone.
Why was he there?

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.751
Perhaps for sentimental reasons.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.429
- You gave him too much leeway.
- Not more than you had.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.234
You pulled me out.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.114
Promoted.
You were emotionally entangled.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.680
So is he.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.990
But this time it's part of the strategy.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.396
<i>Are you sure of this, Mr. Baumann?</i>

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.999
<i>- The death insurance too?</i>
- That too.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.759
The maximum rate policy.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.160
<i>Death insurance transferred to Ms. Lisa...</i>

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.760
Sokulova.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.839
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.916
<i>Transferring insurance.</i>

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.956
- Do you have the ID?
- Level 3+.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.231
Then we'll do it. Tonight.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.999
He wants to be part of it.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.839
He wants to be part of it?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.238
- You didn't let him in on it?
- It was his condition.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.236
We'll put him in Team 1, with Lisa.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.231
He knows we want to cool down Geriatrics.
So he knows what his role is.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.954
Here's the run-through.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.189
2:30 a.m., Team 1 short circuits
the high-voltage power line on Tower 383.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.110
2:31 a.m.,
Team 2 will be in the power station.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.357
It will contaminate the meter and signal
that Geriatrics needs more power.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.120
2:32 a.m.,

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.393
Team 3 will cut
the district power supply line.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.393
2:33 a.m., first blackout.
The emergency generators will boot up.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.196
Team 4, our man in Geriatrics,
will shut down the processor

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.838
for the emergency generators
with a high-energy electromagnetic pulse.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.955
At 2:40 at the latest, the second...

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.518
and decisive blackout.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.510
I'm going in.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.790
<i>Transferring insurance.</i>

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.675
- Where's Lisa?
- Deployed elsewhere.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.352
You want to cut off all the power?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.313
That's not your worry.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.279
The access data
is worthless in a total blackout.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.631
That's why Lisa's already inside.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.276
What?

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.995
<i>Caution, automatic transport.</i>

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.352
STAFF ROOM
CONTROL CENTER

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.671
<i>Caution, automatic transport.</i>

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.516

Vincent Baumann,
insurance agent, field sales.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.080
Gerhard!

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.876
He went to get Lisa out.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.673
- What? Baumann?
- Yes.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.633
Why aren't you at your post?

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.834
He knows Lisa can't get out afterwards
without his biometrics.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.155
Lisa! Nice to see you again.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.991
...assumed you'd do anything
to let your father die.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.153
Why isn't he hooked up?

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.875
His release papers. He can die.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.200
Did you...?

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.032
No, you don't have insurance.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.719
Not anymore.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.149
Vincent!

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.870
Run!

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.034
- Lisa?
- We have her under control.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.830
You played along perfectly,
just as your profile suggested.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.198
You've been promoted. Teamwork.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.277
Call us when you've recovered.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.279
Where is Lisa?

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.839
Withdraw.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.394
Let him go.
