00:11.594 --> 00:14.597
Hey, how would you feel about
loaning me $500?

00:14.806 --> 00:17.267
Uh, I wouldn't feel anything
because I wouldn't do it.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.479
I get that.
That's why I'm only asking for two.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.189
Dude...

00:23.273 --> 00:25.316
What? I just saved you 300 bucks!

00:26.735 --> 00:28.111
Who are you, Geico?

00:30.572 --> 00:31.740
I thought we were bros.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.617
How is you being a bad gambler 
making me a bad friend?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.203
Hey, Tony! You wanna win a bet?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.748
-Put your money on Wilson this week.
-Really?

00:39.831 --> 00:40.915
You got some inside info?

00:40.999 --> 00:41.916
Hello?

00:42.167 --> 00:45.003
You know why we call him Coach Dixon?
'Cause he's the coach.

00:46.671 --> 00:50.091
Yeah, and this year I'm coaching
Rakeem "The Rocket" Rozier.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.721
Believe me, our opening ass-kicking
against Millikan High was no fluke.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.474
You heard him, bro. It's easy money.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.851
Come on, front me the dough,
and we'll split the winnings.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.936
You both clearly have a problem.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.816
Okay? First of all, you haven't had
a winning season in five years.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.154
And you're thinking about betting on
a coach who hasn't had a winning season

01:11.237 --> 01:12.530
in five years!

01:14.157 --> 01:15.116
You know the difference

01:15.200 --> 01:17.035
between a football coach
and a history teacher?

01:17.118 --> 01:18.453
-Hmm?
-A history teacher

01:18.536 --> 01:20.288
never has a winning season.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.333
-What do you mean?
-Twenty years from now,

01:23.416 --> 01:25.376
none of your kids remember a damn thing
you taught 'em.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.545
My kids will remember
their blocking assignments

01:27.629 --> 01:29.172
for the rest of their lives.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.715
-Yeah.
-You know,

01:30.799 --> 01:33.384
for someone who says that football's
more important than academics,

01:33.468 --> 01:36.012
you'd think you'd win a few more games.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.474
Well, I will as long as you pointy-heads

01:39.557 --> 01:41.976
stop treating my guy, The Rocket,
unfairly.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.353
What do you mean "unfairly"?

01:43.436 --> 01:47.565
Ms. Spencer, she's got that poor kid
doing homework during game weeks!

01:47.982 --> 01:49.526
They're all game weeks.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.403
I know. She's a tyrant.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.198
Morning, fellas.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.241
-Hey.
-So,

01:56.324 --> 01:58.243
are you gonna continue that winning streak

01:58.326 --> 01:59.828
-on Friday, Coach?
-[chuckles]

02:00.036 --> 02:01.621
One in a row is not a streak.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.251
I'll do better than that! [chuckles]

02:06.417 --> 02:07.877
As long as you take care of my team,

02:07.961 --> 02:11.005
I'll put something shiny
in that trophy case for ya. Ah!

02:12.549 --> 02:14.175
Oh, anything for you, Coach.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.635
Mama loves her bling.

02:15.718 --> 02:16.886
Oh!

02:17.137 --> 02:20.056
-[chuckles]
-Good morning, everybody.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.059
Fall means roasted pumpkin seeds.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.188
Don't let her fool you.
She's the world's biggest hardass.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.276
He's talking about the old Abby. 
I'm actually mellowing out.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.653
Oh! Tell me your secret.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.155
Oh, she doesn't keep it secret.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.282
I can hear the chanting in my apartment.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.285
Well, if you'd join me in meditation,

02:40.368 --> 02:42.537
you'd see how the universe
would open up to you.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.122
If you'd join me at the drive-through,

02:44.205 --> 02:46.666
you'd see that that universe
is already open.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.877
[chuckles]

02:50.086 --> 02:51.212
I don't know, Gabe.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.715
When I look at someone
as young and vital as Abby,

02:53.798 --> 02:55.633
and I process my own bitterness,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.011
I think she's living right.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.555
Talk to me, girl.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.224
Well, it's all about letting go.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.727
Trust me, baby.
I'm hanging on for dear life.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.732
So, where are we on that loan?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.067
Bro, you need to stop gambling.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.944
Look, I'm going to my AA meeting tonight,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
and Gamblers Anonymous is
right down the hall.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.156
You should go with me.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.699
Gamblers Anonymous?

03:19.782 --> 03:21.868
That's just for people
who are on a cold streak.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.245
Seriously, man, the meetings help.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.122
I haven't had a drop of booze
in eight months.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.498
Not even a rum raisin.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.003
And you're doing great. 
We should go celebrate by...

03:32.337 --> 03:34.255
Wait, what do people
who can't have fun do?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.966
Go-kart, petting zoo, Chuck E. Cheese?

03:37.634 --> 03:40.553
You mock me, but you had a great time
at that petting zoo.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.097
I did.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.030
Captain Morgan's least favorite amendment.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.784
Yo,
I told you Captain Morgan was a real guy.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.538
Bro, I believed you then,
and I believe you now.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.334
Okay, well, let's talk about
some dark days in American history.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.336
Wait, there were bright ones?

04:14.796 --> 04:18.466
[laughs] Oh, America, you just got owned!

04:19.759 --> 04:22.845
Yeah, the, uh, 18th amendment.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.891
Ah, sure, keeping the whole country sober
sounded like a great idea,

04:26.975 --> 04:28.059
but you know who disagreed?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.352
The whole country.

04:30.812 --> 04:34.148
Yeah. Mike's Hard Lemonade
would just be... lemonade.

04:35.858 --> 04:36.901
Both delicious...

04:37.610 --> 04:38.778
I've heard.

04:38.861 --> 04:42.490
Hey, if you have money for hard lemonade,
how about you pay me back?

04:43.866 --> 04:46.369
I can't. I don't have a job.
Nobody's hiring.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.330
Marisol has three jobs.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.999
Yo, she probably took your job.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.170
Yeah, Marisol's one of the good ones.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.718
Oh, here we go.
One of the good whats, Coach Dixon?

05:01.801 --> 05:05.054
One of the good students.
Shame on you for thinking anything else.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.474
I think we were all thinking
something else.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.934
We're getting familiar with you.

05:10.184 --> 05:13.354
All right, listen up.

Hey, baby. 
I'mma holla at you later, 'aight?

05:28.244 --> 05:29.746
[Dixon chuckles]

05:31.039 --> 05:32.332
[Rakeem grunts]

05:34.459 --> 05:35.877
The Rocket is here?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.962
Oh, he's even more impressive in person!

05:39.213 --> 05:41.215
You've only seen him in person.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.677
We go to high school with him.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.971
And now, he's in your class.

05:47.055 --> 05:47.889
You're welcome.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.641
Hey, hey, wait, wait. No, no, he's not.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.976
Well, sure he is.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.687
You, me,
and Principal Madison talked about it.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.149
I clearly heard her tell you,
"Make sure he gets an A." What?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.320
You know, whatever you say, Coach.
As long as he earns the A.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.654
Well, now that I've freed him

06:03.738 --> 06:05.990
from the clutches
of the Dark Lord Ms. Spencer,

06:06.074 --> 06:09.744
you've got a student averaging
eight and a half yards per carry.

06:09.827 --> 06:14.290
Uh, it's actually 8.9 yards a carry,
4.6 after contact.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.543
Wow!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.755
I did not know your people
liked football.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.592
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.012
What? Her people: nerds.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.685
Better, but not okay.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.774
It's all right, Mr. Iglesias.
I'm not sensitive.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.235
I haven't had
five straight losing seasons.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.241
Well, our losing days are over,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.576
thanks
to our soon-to-be honor roll student.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.079
In this class, we aren't given our grades.
We earn them.

06:53.162 --> 06:56.290
No matter how much we offer
to pay Mr. Iglesias.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.001
You offered a dollar.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.629
[chuckles]

07:02.213 --> 07:03.965
It was-- It was an opening offer.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.511
Rakeem's gonna more than earn
his keep here

07:08.594 --> 07:10.096
by what he does on the field.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.639
Alrighty. Good talk.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.350
Welcome aboard, Rakeem.

07:14.767 --> 07:19.272
Uh, before we continue, here in my class,
we like to focus on two main rules, okay?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.108
"Work hard and be nice."

07:22.316 --> 07:26.779
Ah! Coach Dixon also has two rules:
don't get hurt and, uh, don't get caught.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.573
[chuckles]

07:29.407 --> 07:30.616
But does he have a sign?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.621
You know what? I'm glad to be here.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.875
Heard you good people, big man.
Ah, excuse me. [clears throat]

07:39.834 --> 07:42.128
-[sighs]
-You know... [clicks tongue]

07:42.628 --> 07:44.839
...I can't help but feel...

07:45.298 --> 07:49.051
like I'm not getting his full attention.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.846
Hey! What the hell, man?

07:52.180 --> 07:56.142
Look, okay, a person in no way connected
to USC gave those to me, a'ight?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.729
Beats by Tre?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.691

08:04.192 --> 08:06.861
Yeah, they got these
at the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
What are you looking at, man?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.244
I feel like I'm in a good place right now.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.915
Today, this dick dumped a problem on me,
and I dealt with it okay.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.293
A year ago, I probably would've drank
a bottle of tequila

08:22.376 --> 08:23.669
and made love to an ATM machine.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.838
[all laugh]

08:26.380 --> 08:28.799
Still sucks
that that machine never called back.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.676
[all laugh]

08:31.135 --> 08:32.845
Thanks for letting me share, you guys.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.681
Whoo! Yeah!

08:35.765 --> 08:38.267
What happened? How come you're not over
at Gamblers Anonymous?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.062
Dude, there are literally zero ladies
in that meeting.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.981
I guess women don't have
gambling problems.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.235
They do have gambling problems.
Their problem is they bet on men.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.239
Gabe. Hey.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.199
You were such an amazing speaker.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.617
I mean, let's face it,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.119
a lot of the sharers
in here are a trail of tears.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.372
But yours always make me smile.

08:59.956 --> 09:00.790
Thank you.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.333
You know,
there is a trail of tears in there,

09:02.416 --> 09:04.335
but they're hiding behind these dimples.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.295
[both chuckle]

09:07.088 --> 09:10.132
No, you just have this way of talking
about how great you're doing,

09:10.216 --> 09:11.759
and I don't hate myself.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.678
-Hmm.
-Kinda learned that from me.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.096
Hi. Tony.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.140
No drinking problem,
unless I don't have a drink.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.728
Wow. [chuckles] Read the room.

09:26.315 --> 09:30.653
You know, I think it's great you bring
your little foster kid to meetings.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.366
Fine. I'm gonna go get a cookie,
almost Dad.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.995
Don't ruin your appetite, mijo.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.789
[chuckles, sighs]

09:41.872 --> 09:45.126
You know, I am always looking for speakers
for Friday night's meeting.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.377
-Gimme your phone.
-Oh, yeah.

09:46.627 --> 09:50.423
I'll just put my number in it,
and that way, we can keep in touch.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.509
Okay, be careful, 'cause I'm
in the middle of a Duolingo lesson.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.470
Trying to learn Russian, you know?
[chuckles] Just in case.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.849
Okay, I'll see you next week.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.809
Dasvidania, comrade.

10:02.351 --> 10:06.188
-[chuckles softly]
-Hey, since you're speaking Russian now,

10:06.272 --> 10:08.899
why don't you quit "Stalin"
and "Put-it" in her?

10:16.157 --> 10:17.533
Jessica's a friend, bro.

10:17.783 --> 10:21.412
And-- And even if I was interested,
which I'm totally not... can't.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.580
Why not?

10:22.663 --> 10:25.666
Because during the first year of recovery,
there are certain guidelines.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.127
You have to go to 90 meetings in 90 days.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.255
I've been to three faculty meetings
in 11 years, and it was too many.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.383
[chuckles]
Also, you're not supposed to enter

10:34.467 --> 10:37.428
into any new relationships
because if it doesn't work out,

10:37.511 --> 10:40.306
you might go to your crazy ex, you know?
Jose Cuervo.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.811
You haven't had sex in eight months?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.271
Hey, man,
when's the last time you had sex?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.773
Hey, we're talkin' about you, bro!

10:56.822 --> 10:59.116
Oh, hey, Abby,
I checked out that meditation center.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.995
[gasps]
Good for you! Welcome to radical wellness.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.123
-I always feel so tingly when I chant.
-[Paula] Oh.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.960
Me, too.
Oh, my chakras are still tingling,

11:10.044 --> 11:12.630
and my tingles is still chakra-ing.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.717
That's very advanced.
You must be a natural.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.845
Oh, I'm a natural woman,
like Aretha Franklin, Queen of Soul.

11:19.929 --> 11:20.763
Respect.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.142
Oh, hey. Guess what?

11:25.309 --> 11:27.853
Some hot alchy wants a ticket
to ride the G train.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.857
-The G is Gabe, and the train is--
-They get it, bro.

11:31.941 --> 11:32.775
They get it.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.027
I was being nice.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.613
Look, she could have
any of those boozehounds,

11:37.697 --> 11:38.864
but she chose you.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.201
She didn't choose me.
And like I said, man,

11:42.284 --> 11:44.120
I'm not allowed to date her
even if I wanted to.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.790
Gabe, I am so proud of you
for engaging in self-care.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.376
When you lean into the rules
of the universe,

11:50.459 --> 11:53.963
the universe bestows its many gifts.
Namaste.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.053
What does that even mean?

12:01.137 --> 12:03.180
That's white girl talk for "hit that."

12:05.933 --> 12:08.811
There he is! Iglesias, get up here, man!

12:08.894 --> 12:11.105
What? How ya doin', bro?

12:11.188 --> 12:14.108
Boom shakalaka! [chuckles]

12:14.233 --> 12:17.111
Hey, thanks so much
for taking care of Rakeem.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.487
Bit of an update:

12:19.196 --> 12:21.198
he's not doing great in biology.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.659
Can you give him two As in your class?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.079
I don't know. Should I?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.123
Shouldn't I? No.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.458
Hah.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.335
So what else is going on in Gabe World?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.463
I'm glad you asked. Actually, I'm--

12:35.546 --> 12:37.173
Okay, good catching up.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.347
Paula, I know we all wanna win,
but how can you be okay with that?

12:45.431 --> 12:49.018
Because the only thing missing
from our résumé is a football title.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.103
Oh, you can totally put that
on your résumé.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.813
Nobody checks those things.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.735
Gabe, you were the one who said,
"No child should be left behind."

12:58.027 --> 12:59.945
That should include Rakeem,

13:00.029 --> 13:03.741
a student so fast,
he leaves the other team behind.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.370
Thanks for the support, boss.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.288
Mm-hmm.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.042
[in Italian accent] Hey, paisano!

13:13.125 --> 13:14.335
What're you doing?

13:14.418 --> 13:17.671
The peppers are the best part
of the sandwich, eh?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.674
What? My sandwich, my business.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.677
Ah, come on. What's the matter?

13:23.761 --> 13:27.097
Too spicy for my Latino bambino, eh?

13:28.265 --> 13:31.393
I got a very sensitive palate.
I don't gotta prove anything to you.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.312
It's just peppers, man. Mm.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.439
[chokes]

13:37.066 --> 13:38.359
[Tony laughs]

13:38.442 --> 13:42.154
Yeah, I bet you wish you could...
[in Italian accent] ...forget about it!

13:42.696 --> 13:44.698
[continues coughing]

13:44.865 --> 13:46.408
Oh, forget about it.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.118
Forget about it.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.287
[Gabe] Mm.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.667
[gasps]

13:55.918 --> 13:57.837
I haven't tasted that in eight months.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.880
-[in normal voice] What?
-There's booze in this.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.257
No way.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.011
[sniffs]

14:07.096 --> 14:09.515
[smacks lips]
Oh, yeah, that's booze, all right.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.814
I think we may have figured out
why Coach hasn't had a winning season

14:16.897 --> 14:17.773
in five years.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.738
Just a word of advice,

14:24.822 --> 14:28.450
if a grown man in dress sweats has
a large travel mug,

14:28.951 --> 14:30.119
don't drink from it.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.456
See, this lady knows
what I'm talking about, right?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.625
-[mouths]
-[Gabe] Yeah, you know?

14:36.709 --> 14:41.297
And sure, the slip was an honest mistake,
but the problem is how good it tasted.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.800
Oh!
That warm feeling when it hits your chest.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.888
That "pain go bye-bye" feeling. It...

14:51.140 --> 14:52.600
-Uh...
-[mouthing]

14:52.975 --> 14:54.643
The good news is I'm doing great.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.438
I'm doin'-- doin' fantastic, you know?

14:57.521 --> 14:59.982
I can't believe-- I'm doing so great,
I just bought a boat.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.651
[chuckles sheepishly]

15:02.902 --> 15:05.446
Yeah, all aboard! [chuckles]

15:05.821 --> 15:07.031
[imitates boat horn]

15:08.616 --> 15:09.867
Thanks for letting me share.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.371
[Gabe sighs]

15:14.788 --> 15:17.917
[man] Okay, hey, I'd like to thank Gabe
for coming up to speak.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.168
I'm sure you enjoyed that.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.713
Okay, a couple of announcements...
[continues indistinctly]

15:26.508 --> 15:27.927
Bro, what is wrong with you?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.345
Dude, I don't know, man.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.348
It's like, I went up there,
and I was talking about having a drink,

15:32.431 --> 15:34.642
and then she came in,
and I was all like, "Ugh."

15:34.725 --> 15:37.019
I didn't want her to see me vulnerable,
you know, bro?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.521
So then, when I saw her
and I finally did start to speak,

15:39.605 --> 15:41.357
I sounded
like I was going through puberty.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.402
I was like... [voice cracking] "Oh, hi!
Everything great? How are you?"

15:46.278 --> 15:48.572
-I knew it. You do like her.
-Yeah.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.366
Glad you're caught up, bro.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.494
Iglesias. First of all,
I want to apologize.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.830
I heard you drank a little
of the coach's apple juice.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.249
Uh, yeah,
I didn't taste a hint of honeycrisp.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.211
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, what kind of a degenerate are you?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.046
And how much should I bet on Wilson
this week?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.047
[chuckles]

16:05.130 --> 16:06.215
I can explain.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.925
I'm fighting an infection,

16:08.008 --> 16:10.886
-and that was a prescription.
-Mm-hmm. Oh?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.972
So your doctor prescribed Malibu rum?

16:13.806 --> 16:17.351
Well, he's more of a healer than a doctor,
but yeah. Yep.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.396
Uh, you know what?
It's cool, man. Apology accepted.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.398
What? I never apologized.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.068
Oh, my bad. When you said,
"First of all, I want to apologize,"

16:26.151 --> 16:28.070
I kind of took that as an apology.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.116
Wow, some people just hear
what they want to hear. [chuckles]

16:32.241 --> 16:35.786
Yeah, like, "Sure, drop your player off
in my class. I'm cool with it."

16:35.869 --> 16:36.829
Bingo!

16:37.413 --> 16:38.414
You're my guy.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.499
[bell rings]

16:42.209 --> 16:45.587
Hey, so what're you gonna do
about Jess the hot mess?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.131
Oh, sorry.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.341
[whispers] Anonymous the hot mess.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.803
I don't know, bro. I guess I'm gonna do
what any reasonable person would do.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.472
Gonna start going to different meetings
in a different part of town,

16:55.556 --> 16:59.768
where I'll never run into her again,
so I can die sober and alone.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.649
[sighs] Good morning, history class!

17:05.941 --> 17:08.235
[whoops]
It's a great day to be alive, right?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.990
Hey, man. I'll holla at you later.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.410
What's up?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.374
What's up, Suge White?

17:25.961 --> 17:29.590
Nothing like a bunch of fresh faces
I don't have to bare my soul to.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.843
You know, a man's soul is his own thing.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.137
It's private. So back off, Amazon!

17:35.220 --> 17:38.223
I bought these kicks 'cause I wanted to,
not 'cause you told me to!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.810
-[Grace] I have a question.
-Go ahead, Grace.

17:42.269 --> 17:45.022
Why doesn't Coach just let you
take direct snaps?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.565
We all know you're getting the ball.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.194
I don't know
why I thought the question was for me.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.987
Good looking out, Grace.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.114
I mean,
you might see some wildcat formation

17:54.198 --> 17:55.282
against Lakewood.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.701
You are a cutie.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.579
My family calls me a wildcat.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.206
You know, 'cause I can sleep anywhere,

18:02.289 --> 18:04.583
and I bathe with very little water.
[clicks tongue]

18:07.044 --> 18:09.213
And do you think
they're complimenting you?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.011
[chuckles] Focus, wildcat.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.556
Mikey. Mikey, man, you're so soft.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.809
I bet you cried at the end of Toy Story 3.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.477
[students laugh]

18:24.103 --> 18:26.480
He did. I was there. Oh!

18:27.022 --> 18:28.565
Hey, come on. Settle down, you guys.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.567
Andy was going away to college!

18:31.985 --> 18:33.570
Something you'll never do.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.905
[students] Oh!

18:34.988 --> 18:38.534
Walt, you are not the guy in this class
who can make that joke.

18:40.077 --> 18:40.911
Yeah, okay,

18:40.994 --> 18:43.247
I don't think I'm the only one
with a crush.

18:44.123 --> 18:48.585
I mean-- I mean, I don't--
I don't have a crush. [whines]

18:49.837 --> 18:51.713
Shut up, Mikey.
You're always talking about--

18:51.797 --> 18:52.840
-No! Wait!
-You shut up!

18:52.923 --> 18:53.841
[indistinct shouting]

18:53.924 --> 18:55.759
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:55.843 --> 18:57.511
Freakin' back off. She's mine.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.480
Remember, "work hard and be nice"?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.190
Walt, I cut you slack on the first part

19:10.274 --> 19:13.110
'cause you've always been so good
at the second. I'm really disappointed.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.570
Rakeem started it.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.947
Rakeem just got here.
He doesn't even know he's here.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.493
You've been staring at that sign all year.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.663
I expect more from you.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.540
That's really on you, then.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.960
Well, that's it.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.713
I'll discuss this with your parents
who I need to see after school.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.464
Parents?

19:34.548 --> 19:37.259
If-- If my dad shows up, text me.
I'd love to see him.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.304
Probably with my dad.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.684
Running free somewhere on a farm
where all dads go when they say,

19:45.767 --> 19:47.019
"I'll be right back."

19:51.190 --> 19:52.900
I hope we beat Lakewood Friday.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.443
Or at least beat the spread.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.113
Ah, yeah, nothing like putting
your hard-earned paycheck

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
in the hands of hormonal teens.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.910
That's what I call living.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.164
Tony, if the universe wants you
to win your bet, you'll win your bet.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.751
Will the universe bring me
my long-legged beauty I deserve?

20:11.376 --> 20:14.129
Well, the universe has its limitations.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.009
Uh, hi, I'm looking for-- Oh, God.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.094
Tell me you're not Mr. Iglesias.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.180
I'm not Mr. Iglesias.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.349
Uh... [gasps]

20:26.642 --> 20:28.518
-[chuckles]
-Jessica.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.895
Gabe.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.109
What are you doing here?

20:36.443 --> 20:38.070
[chuckles] I'm Walt's mom.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.033
-[Gabe] Oh!
-This is so great!

20:43.116 --> 20:46.203
It's just great. Yeah. [chuckles]

20:47.579 --> 20:50.290
Oh, my God, it's happening. [chuckles]

20:51.708 --> 20:53.252
Uh, we should roll, Abby.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.588
No! No, no, no, no!
You guys should stay, you should stay.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.090
[mouthing]

20:59.007 --> 21:01.551
Can't. Places to go. People to see.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.220
Universes to explore.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.435
So, Mr. Iglesias.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.604
-[chuckles]
-All right, now I know your last name.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.982
Yeah, now I know yours, too.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.318
Mom.

21:19.820 --> 21:20.737
Hi.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.453
[clears throat]
So, Walt's up to his old tricks, huh?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.498
Yeah, um, he only really has one trick.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.709
Supreme lack of effort on all fronts?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.169
-Ta-da!
-[chuckles]

21:36.837 --> 21:38.255
He gets that from his dad.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.301
Although my ex focused his lack of effort
mostly on our marriage.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.970
Well, underneath,
Walt's a really, really great kid,

21:45.053 --> 21:47.055
and I'm sure he gets that from his mom.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.558
Mmm. Eh, she's all right.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.643
-How are you?
-I'm single.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.772
I mean, I'm single, but it doesn't mean,
you know, anything, just--

21:55.856 --> 21:59.318
I'm just letting you know, um...
[chuckles] Let's talk about Walt.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.944
[chuckles]

22:01.820 --> 22:05.240
Um, well, he-- he told me
that he picked on a classmate.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.992
He feels really bad about it.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.245
Great! Great, great. Well, well,
we're done. [chuckles]

22:10.871 --> 22:12.706
Wow, yeah, that was quick.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.750
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you know.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.711
[chuckles] All right. I guess I'll, uh,
I'll just see you at the meetings.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.588
Ah, um, about that,

22:19.921 --> 22:22.716
I'm gonna start going
to the meetings in, uh, in Belmont

22:22.799 --> 22:24.551
because, uh, my mechanic...

22:24.634 --> 22:27.095
my mechanic,
he just moved his shop over there,

22:27.179 --> 22:28.805
and, uh, I drive a classic.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.349
It's a real old car, you know.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.560
I gotta go where he goes,
or the car don't go, so you know.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.895
-You get it, you know.
-Cool.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.939
Yeah, that makes sense. [chuckles]
Kinda.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.734
Uh, well, we'll always have Walt.

22:40.817 --> 22:44.446
Yeah. Yeah, and the way he's going,
for at least another six, seven years.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.405
No.

22:50.118 --> 22:54.414
Abby. Thank you
for turning me on to meditation.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.667
Right? We keep seeking approval
from others

22:57.751 --> 23:00.212
when we have all the love we need
when we're alone.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.589
Who said anything about being alone?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.301
Meditating. It's a solitary practice.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.638
Oh, not when you find
a fine meditation teacher

23:10.013 --> 23:12.808
who doesn't mind
having his ponytail used as a handle.

23:12.891 --> 23:13.975
[grunts]

23:21.566 --> 23:22.442
Hey, guys!

23:24.152 --> 23:25.612
What are you talking about?

23:26.279 --> 23:28.824
I bet it's not anything creepy or gross.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.202
We're talking about feelings.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.995
So it's pretty creepy and gross.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.624
Look, she drops into your lap
at your meetings

23:37.707 --> 23:39.459
and then shows up in your classroom?

23:39.543 --> 23:42.087
Abby's right.
The universe is talking to you.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.840
No, Gabe. The universe is yelling at you.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.884
Why? I didn't do anything to it!

23:48.427 --> 23:50.345
It's saying, "Go to her!"

23:50.429 --> 23:53.515
At first, she'll be scared,
but then she'll fall into your arms

23:53.598 --> 23:56.059
and you'll ride off into the sky
in a convertible,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.645
like John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.191
Wow, Olivia was in for
a very big disappointment

24:03.275 --> 24:05.152
when they got to where they were going.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.656
Paula, I just picked out the exact spot
in our trophy case

24:09.739 --> 24:10.907
for when we win the title.

24:10.991 --> 24:14.119
Girls Cross-Country does not deserve
that prime real estate.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.247
Anything for you, Coach. Ha!

24:17.330 --> 24:20.459
Bling, bling, shine bright like a diamond!
Okurrr!

24:21.918 --> 24:24.421
Okurrr! [chuckles]

24:25.589 --> 24:27.132
Mm. [sighs]

24:27.966 --> 24:29.801
Just came to get a cup of coffee.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.804
I like my coffee
like I like my running backs...

24:36.308 --> 24:37.267
Come on.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.060
What? Strong!

24:39.811 --> 24:42.022
Shame on you for thinking anything else.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.191
You know,
I really appreciate the all-out blitz

24:44.274 --> 24:45.484
you unleashed in my classroom.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.527
Yeah, Rakeem said he's having a good time.

24:47.611 --> 24:48.737
He's not learning anything.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.572
That's probably why
he's having a good time.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.034
Well, Coach, unfortunately,
the good time's about to end,

24:54.117 --> 24:57.913
because he just turned in a paper,
and it still had "Wikipedia" on it.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.623
That's unacceptable.

25:00.332 --> 25:04.377
Got it. Next time I'll tell him,
"Take off the 'Wikipedia.'" [scoffs]

25:06.755 --> 25:09.424
Gabe, when are you gonna ask out
Walt's mom?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.927
When she stops being Walt's mom.

25:13.553 --> 25:17.098
Hey, Paula, isn't there some policy
against faculty dating parents?

25:17.182 --> 25:19.935
It's in that binder full of stuff
I refuse to read,

25:20.018 --> 25:22.229
because I need plausible deniability.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.773
I say go for it.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.733
You're all against me, huh?

25:26.816 --> 25:28.944
No, Gabe. We're all for you.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.946
Taking a chance on love.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.030
And smashing.

25:34.366 --> 25:38.620
Look, guys, the universe isn't Tinkerbell
making all of your dreams come true.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.372
It's more like the chupacabra.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.752
And he's hiding in your back seat,
and you think everything's going great.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.588
You're driving down that highway,
and all of a sudden,

25:48.672 --> 25:50.048
[screams]

25:50.131 --> 25:51.591
"It's got my face!

25:51.800 --> 25:54.886
It's got my face! The bridge is out!

25:54.970 --> 25:56.346
The bridge is out!"

25:56.429 --> 25:57.847
And then it's a race against time

25:57.931 --> 26:00.767
to see if you can get out of the car
before it sinks.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.271
I like my universe better.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.441
Yeah, I took Abby's advice, Gabe.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.069
Trust me, the Earth moved.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.244
Look, I know it's dangerous
and it feels like you can drown,

26:19.411 --> 26:23.081
but if there's one guy that can take
that chupacabra by the horns, it's you.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.375
So you think I should?

26:25.875 --> 26:27.085
Jessica seems worth it.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.630
She does, doesn't she? [chuckles]

26:31.339 --> 26:33.091
You're gonna make it outta that car, bro.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.342
Kick out the windshield!

26:36.428 --> 26:38.597
Swim, Gabe, swim!

26:45.645 --> 26:47.606
-Jessica.
-Oh, hey, stranger.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.316
You're a long way from Belmont.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.943
Yeah, I know. I stopped going over there.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.404
Turns out my mechanic moved over there
to get away from me.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.489
-What?
-Yeah.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.407
Can you believe that?

26:57.490 --> 26:59.826
To go to all that trouble
to not see someone.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.494
-Huh.
-[sighs]

27:01.578 --> 27:02.871
The truth is, uh,

27:02.954 --> 27:05.540
I-- I've been going over there
to avoid seeing you.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.419
And... you came here to tell me that?

27:09.544 --> 27:10.670
Mm-hmm.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.673
Oh, baby, you suck at avoiding people.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.303
I know. I'm not good at it.

27:18.386 --> 27:19.554
[chuckles]

27:20.138 --> 27:21.598
I should've been honest with you.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.558
Well, why would you be avoiding me?

27:24.309 --> 27:28.647
I had a slip, and it was an accident,
but all I could think of was just--

27:28.730 --> 27:31.858
How good and right it felt
taking that first drink?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.486
-Yes.
-Yup, been there, rode that horse.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.280
-Mm.
-Fell off that horse. Literally.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.866
I got so drunk,
I thought I could ride a horse.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.743
[both laugh]

27:42.118 --> 27:45.622
You know, I was in there,
and I was talking about how weak I was

27:45.705 --> 27:47.457
and how vulnerable I felt,

27:47.540 --> 27:49.918
and then you walked in,
and the only thing I was worried about

27:50.001 --> 27:51.878
was making sure you didn't see me
that way.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.464
Ah.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.383
That is so messed up.

27:57.050 --> 27:57.884
I mean,

27:58.176 --> 28:01.137
you know, not the part
where you said you liked me, but...

28:01.262 --> 28:03.640
just, the part
where you didn't want to come here,

28:03.723 --> 28:05.016
and lean on us, you know,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.519
share you're just as human
as the rest of us.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.230
Wait, when did I say I liked you?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.901
It's... It's pretty clear.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.696
So, um...

28:18.238 --> 28:19.072
So now what?

28:20.448 --> 28:21.366
Well...

28:22.784 --> 28:26.996
Well, I was about to go in there and share
how I met this incredible guy this year.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.709
But of course, because it's me,
it's gotta be complicated and messy.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.377
If we ever get his and her towels,

28:32.460 --> 28:34.212
you can be "complicated,"
and I'll be "messy."

28:34.295 --> 28:36.089
[chuckles]

28:36.381 --> 28:37.674
I'm sorry, was that too forward?

28:37.757 --> 28:38.967
What, are you kidding me?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.594
I went on a first date with a guy
who asked me for a kidney.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.680
-Kidney?
-[scoffs]

28:43.763 --> 28:46.433
-That sounds more like a third date.
-[chuckles]

28:47.142 --> 28:49.602
Hey, I guess we're all just
a bunch of broken toys.

28:49.978 --> 28:50.812
Well...

28:51.604 --> 28:54.983
You know, what actually made me think
I wasn't out of my mind is...

28:56.151 --> 28:58.653
my son thinks this guy
is pretty special too.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.656
-Sharp kid.
-[chuckles softly]

29:02.699 --> 29:05.493
You might want to ignore
that progress report that's in the mail.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.707
So, I dunno what I'm gonna do.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.667
'Cause...

29:14.169 --> 29:15.712
trust me, no one's...

29:17.547 --> 29:20.008
no one's made me feel like this
in a really long time.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.218
Wow.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.638
Well, whoever this guy is,
I hope he doesn't ask you out

29:25.722 --> 29:29.601
before I get my one-year chip
in four months and 11 days.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.688
-But who's keeping track?
-[chuckles softly]

29:34.939 --> 29:36.232
I like that idea.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.654
[sighs] God, this is so crazy.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.739
You know?

29:42.947 --> 29:45.200
If we were sharing a bottle of vodka
right now,

29:45.492 --> 29:47.494
I would've already jumped your bones.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.628
Well, thank God we're sober!

30:00.673 --> 30:03.092
[theme music playing]
