00:00.997 --> 00:02.490
Previously on "One Tree Hill"…

00:02.536 --> 00:04.774
Who would have known that Dan Scott’s basketball pedigree

00:04.809 --> 00:08.409
would be inherited by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas.

00:08.599 --> 00:10.570
I can’t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.491
This is all about you, Danny, until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son.

00:15.547 --> 00:18.072
I finally saw you clearly for the first time last night,

00:18.101 --> 00:20.109
the way you treated me, the way you treated your brother.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.146
- Don’t call him that.
- I mean it. We’re done.

00:22.586 --> 00:23.616
You still in denial?

00:23.728 --> 00:24.389
About what?

00:25.250 --> 00:26.070
Missing her.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.900
What, are you my tutor or my shrink?

00:28.390 --> 00:29.510
You’re just tutoring him?

00:29.540 --> 00:31.424
I am just tutoring him.

00:31.455 --> 00:34.900
Nathan? God! He got a good grade on a math quiz. It was nothing!

00:35.940 --> 00:36.815
Keith!

00:37.378 --> 00:40.478
I like who you are. And I do count on you.

00:40.525 --> 00:41.439
I love you.

00:41.695 --> 00:42.821
Wow. You made me a mix?

00:42.939 --> 00:44.183
Don’t read too much into it.

00:44.841 --> 00:48.847
I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas.

00:48.904 --> 00:52.196
And I know I like Lucas, and I don’t know who the hell you like anymore.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.774
All I remember is you and me and Tutor Girl in my car,

01:38.937 --> 01:42.378
and then Lucas and Nathan, and then you said something about being into Lucas

01:42.450 --> 01:43.908
but it could have been Nathan,

01:44.164 --> 01:45.967
- and I need to know.
- Need?

01:46.623 --> 01:51.087
Two of them, two of us, plenty of fine Scott boys to go around,

01:51.139 --> 01:53.427
and your courtesy hold on Lucas has expired.

01:53.893 --> 01:55.715
And you and Nathan were so…

01:56.540 --> 01:58.142
interesting together.

01:58.649 --> 02:00.344
Plus, we could still trade off once in a while…

02:00.575 --> 02:02.060
or twice. Win-win.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.394
Hey, broody.

02:05.433 --> 02:07.875
Hey, cheery. Peyton.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.066
So, I’ll see you at practice?

02:11.240 --> 02:12.008
As always.

02:12.755 --> 02:13.656
Yeah, you too.

02:18.075 --> 02:22.576
So, what’s the deal? Are we gonna hang out at this annual Scott money burn or what?

02:22.714 --> 02:23.676
Yeah, right.

02:24.336 --> 02:26.851
Like I’m gonna spend the night with Nathan and Dan on my Friday off?

02:26.917 --> 02:30.040
I don’t think so. I’d rather stay home with "The Great Gatsby."

02:32.395 --> 02:33.635
You know, I read a book last night.

02:33.983 --> 02:34.562
Really?

02:35.386 --> 02:39.293
Yeah, it’s about this girl and this guy, and they’ve got this really weird vibe thing going on,

02:39.355 --> 02:42.523
but there’s all this drama, ‘cause the girl’s got this ex-boyfriend

02:42.584 --> 02:46.338
who turns out to be none other than the guy’s brother.

02:46.501 --> 02:50.884
So the whole thing comes to this great, big climax and this big party at their evil dad’s house.

02:51.243 --> 02:51.909
Really?

02:53.060 --> 02:55.482
Hmm. What happens in the end?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.437
You’re just gonna have to show up to find out.

03:06.275 --> 03:09.486
Oh, this is so stupid. What-why do we have to study history anyway?

03:10.540 --> 03:11.964
So we’re not doomed to repeat it.

03:12.778 --> 03:13.279
What?

03:14.483 --> 03:16.372
Look, don’t lose hope, okay?

03:16.577 --> 03:19.286
Tomorrow’s a teacher’s work day so you’ve got a three-day weekend to study.

03:20.012 --> 03:22.481
Minus my dad’s annual kiss-his-ass jamboree.

03:24.605 --> 03:29.736
Hey, I would invite you, Haley, but it’s kind of a b-ball crowd.

03:29.807 --> 03:32.296
Oh, please, come on. Like I want to kiss your dad’s ass anyway.

03:33.211 --> 03:33.806
Yeah.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.131
I made you a study guide.

03:36.088 --> 03:40.467
And, everything you need to ace your history exam…

03:40.528 --> 03:46.032
is right in this little box of tricks here-NoDoz, eye drops, number-two pencils.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.891
Why don’t you just text message me the answers.

03:48.014 --> 03:49.689
Oh! No.

03:52.422 --> 03:55.714
So, um, just give me a call if you need anything, okay?

03:57.552 --> 03:59.303
Thanks for cutting Lucas some slack.

04:00.342 --> 04:01.572
A deal’s a deal, right?

04:02.705 --> 04:03.378
Right.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.468
Anything worth sharing?

04:12.503 --> 04:13.983
- Hmm?
- In the paper?

04:15.109 --> 04:18.774
Oh. Um, the Tar Heels won.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.791
- Oh, Deb.
- Hi, Karen.

04:21.180 --> 04:21.699
Hey.

04:21.956 --> 04:24.878
Um, I never heard from both of you about Dan’s party tomorrow

04:25.476 --> 04:27.925
for the team sponsors.

04:28.018 --> 04:32.185
For some reason, when I think of Dan, I just don’t think of the word party.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.856
Oh, I’m sorry, Deb. I have the invitation here.

04:36.940 --> 04:40.330
I was thinking about going, but after everything that happened last week-

04:40.397 --> 04:42.578
Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.

04:43.371 --> 04:45.046
Dan feels horrible about that…

04:45.921 --> 04:47.497
- believe it or not.
- Not.

04:48.558 --> 04:49.578
And so do I.

04:50.162 --> 04:52.423
Anyway, it would mean a lot if you could both come.

04:52.639 --> 04:56.392
It starts at three, but, uh, stop by anytime. See you.

04:57.016 --> 04:58.055
See you, Deb. Thanks.

05:00.611 --> 05:02.469
You know what? I think Deb’s right.

05:04.169 --> 05:06.447
We’re not living in some 1950s movie.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.310
I am the single mom of a player on the team.

05:09.535 --> 05:12.959
I don’t need to skulk around this town in a head scarf and dark glasses.

05:13.181 --> 05:14.512
Well, you’re never going to get Lucas to go.

05:14.639 --> 05:17.160
- Oh, even if you’re going, too?
- Oh, not a chance.

05:17.927 --> 05:22.577
Besides, I don’t want things to be any weirder than they need to be.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.074
Weirder? How?

05:25.453 --> 05:26.052
Well,

05:27.803 --> 05:29.580
you know, after dinner the other night,

05:30.424 --> 05:32.457
I said some pretty crazy things.

05:34.158 --> 05:36.712
No, I don’t remember anything crazy.

05:39.149 --> 05:40.153
Well, I’m gonna go.

05:40.337 --> 05:41.858
You let me know if you change your mind.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.373
-  Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.243 --> 05:54.147
Okay, you guys, listen up. Now, you’ll all want to pay close attention to this next batch of slides.

05:54.499 --> 05:57.545
We’ll be discussing them following the slide show and,

05:58.070 --> 06:03.381
I also have a feeling that this material may find its way onto your next quiz, so…

06:03.429 --> 06:04.222
How are you, Nate?

06:06.148 --> 06:06.844
Bored.

06:07.397 --> 06:08.467
And lonely, right?

06:09.659 --> 06:10.751
Just a smidge.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.537
Brooke, whatever drugs you’re on, save them for the party, okay?

06:15.645 --> 06:20.187
Ah, "the party." Guess who’s coming with me, and I’ll tell you Peyton.

06:20.519 --> 06:21.196
W hatever.

06:21.994 --> 06:25.803
She’s off my radar, and apparently, I’m off hers too.

06:26.069 --> 06:29.249
That was pot Peyton. She’s totally back on track.

06:29.613 --> 06:34.527
And I think the new "old Peyton" would be open to discussing a reconciliation.

06:35.910 --> 06:36.935
Did she tell you that?

06:37.032 --> 06:38.440
She tells me everything.

06:38.896 --> 06:40.800
- What are you up to, Brooke?
- What?

06:41.328 --> 06:44.651
I just want to see two people that are perfect for each other back together.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.023
Is that a crime?

06:54.583 --> 06:55.462
Sorry I’m late, coach.

06:55.971 --> 06:59.436
Why should today be any different, Jagielski? Move your ass.

06:59.555 --> 07:03.164
The rest of you ladies start defense drills, pronto!

07:04.926 --> 07:06.355
Why is coach so easy on you, Jagielski?

07:06.488 --> 07:07.792
Baumgartner got wind sprints.

07:08.069 --> 07:08.842
We party together.

07:09.344 --> 07:10.195
Maybe they’re lovers.

07:11.362 --> 07:12.488
Why, did you two break up?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.939
So, anyway, man, what’s the deal? What’s going on?

07:18.985 --> 07:22.763
You know, you’re out sick all the time, and you come in late and cut out early.

07:22.953 --> 07:24.397
I don’t understand. Coach just lets you.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.436
Just helping me out.

07:26.793 --> 07:27.409
Meaning?

07:27.996 --> 07:29.189
Meaning he’s just helping me out.

07:32.195 --> 07:32.886
All right.

07:54.113 --> 07:57.575
- Whoa! Walking here.
- God! I’m-I’m sorry.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.418
Like you weren’t aiming.

07:59.494 --> 08:00.489
You’re not on that list.

08:01.333 --> 08:02.295
You need a ride somewhere?

08:04.474 --> 08:05.614
Come on, get in.

08:09.486 --> 08:11.608
I guess it’s better to be in your car then under it.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.256
So, I’m not really good at this.

08:20.487 --> 08:23.232
Yeah, obviously you’re gonna want to put that in gear and give it a little gas.

08:23.292 --> 08:24.056
No, I meant...

08:25.300 --> 08:27.855
I mean the whole not-being-defensive thing.

08:28.190 --> 08:28.870
Okay.

08:30.820 --> 08:34.210
Last week in Brooke’s car, you said he cares about me,

08:34.270 --> 08:37.830
and I was trying really hard to be cool, and I didn’t ask,

08:38.602 --> 08:41.715
- whether you meant Nathan or Lucas.
- And now you’re asking?

08:43.208 --> 08:45.483
In a pathetic kind of way, yeah.

08:45.581 --> 08:48.744
I’m not gonna be much help. I guess I meant both of them.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.058
Lucky you.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.688
Look, it’s not like you need my permission or anything, but if you like Nathan,

08:58.759 --> 09:02.399
it’s totally cool. Just be really careful.

09:02.507 --> 09:04.822
Be careful. Yes, I know. You told me.

09:06.528 --> 09:08.535
- You be careful, too.
- With which one?

09:08.785 --> 09:12.062
Driving. My mother likes it when I get home alive. Let’s go.

09:18.621 --> 09:19.577
Hey, mom. Hey, Keith.

09:20.509 --> 09:22.618
This doesn’t fit anymore. I need a new jacket.

09:23.754 --> 09:25.880
I think I’m going to go to this thing tomorrow.

09:26.039 --> 09:26.976
What changed your mind?

09:28.491 --> 09:29.562
Well, I don’t know. I mean…

09:30.320 --> 09:31.620
Nothing really.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.278
Well, we’ll go to Vietti’s first thing. Get you a new jacket.

09:37.856 --> 09:39.889
All right. Thanks, mom. See you, Keith.

09:40.012 --> 09:40.730
See you, Luke.

09:41.384 --> 09:43.443
- A girl?
- What else?

09:43.692 --> 09:47.237
Hmm. Well, I guess I’m gonna have to go to this thing then.

09:47.323 --> 09:49.446
You? I thought you already had your mind made up.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.998
- Did you get cold feet?
- Like ice.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.948
Something about stepping directly into the Lion’s Den.

09:55.229 --> 09:55.991
Oh…

09:56.924 --> 09:58.132
Okay, you talked me into it.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.660
Just promise me you won’t punch him unless I ask you real nice.

10:01.962 --> 10:02.653
Okay.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.506
- Enjoy.
- Bye-bye.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.178
Haven’t you heard goth is the new geek?

10:13.442 --> 10:14.690
Tonight’s gonna be killer.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.135
You and Nathan, me and Lucas, an open bar.

10:18.735 --> 10:23.256
There is no me and Nathan, or you and Lucas, for that matter.

10:23.639 --> 10:27.122
For now. You know, Nathan’s loving the idea that you’re coming tonight.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.058
How do you know that?

10:28.258 --> 10:29.901
‘Cause he told be he’s still hot for you.

10:30.414 --> 10:32.672
He was actually very sweet about it.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.473
Nathan Scott?

10:33.537 --> 10:35.041
You know you two were meant to be together.

10:36.282 --> 10:37.494
That’s a scary thought.

10:52.072 --> 10:52.636
Haley?

10:54.457 --> 10:55.185
What are you doing here?

10:56.737 --> 10:58.559
First, I am saving you from that tie.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.151
Second…

11:02.261 --> 11:03.490
we need to talk.

11:03.837 --> 11:04.943
Well, could we do both at the same time.

11:05.050 --> 11:05.855
Yeah.

11:07.095 --> 11:11.205
Uh, okay, you’re not gonna like this. In fact…

11:12.224 --> 11:13.100
you’re gonna hate this.

11:14.405 --> 11:19.294
But I feel that I should tell you in the interest of full friendship disclosure.

11:20.538 --> 11:22.687
Yeah, right. What could be worse than you tutoring Nathan, huh?

11:28.465 --> 11:29.638
You like him.

11:29.694 --> 11:33.671
Luke, do not freak out on me, okay? I can’t help it any more then you can.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.125
- I don’t like him!
- I’m talking about you and Peyton.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.706
We  don’t decide who we like. We just-it happens.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.453
Do you know what you’re getting yourself into?

11:42.504 --> 11:46.155
I’m not getting myself into anything. I am thinking about maybe getting into something

11:46.201 --> 11:48.485
that is never gonna happen anyway, so-

11:48.541 --> 11:50.542
But what could you possibly like in the guy, huh?

11:51.347 --> 11:54.455
Different stuff. We connect.

11:54.768 --> 11:59.320
Yes, he can be a total ass sometimes but I’m telling you, it’s just a defense mechanism.

11:59.391 --> 12:01.516
He really opens up with me, Lucas.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.151
You know how I feel about it.

12:07.224 --> 12:10.388
And I’m sorry for that. I am.

12:12.877 --> 12:15.448
But I get it, all right?

12:16.384 --> 12:17.264
I understand.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.529
Okay.

12:18.616 --> 12:20.228
Just do me a favor, okay? Just-

12:20.320 --> 12:21.407
Be careful?

12:24.883 --> 12:26.640
I wish everybody would stop saying that.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.670
Three fingers of whiskey, just a whisper of sweet vermouth,

12:34.058 --> 12:37.478
a splash of bitters, a crush cherry- A perfect Manhattan.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.930
Oh, so that’s how you like it?

12:40.454 --> 12:41.805
Well, that’s one way I like it.

12:42.815 --> 12:43.659
Excuse us.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.777
She’s young enough to be your daughter, and in this town, she might just be.

12:49.972 --> 12:52.009
- Ouch.
- Sorry, couldn’t resist.

12:52.460 --> 12:56.930
I spoke with Karen yesterday. She might be coming with Lucas and Keith.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.264
They had to know the invitation was just a formality.

12:59.352 --> 13:00.882
Mm. Until I invited them in person.

13:00.985 --> 13:02.608
Deb, you know how important this party is for me.

13:02.719 --> 13:04.184
Oh, I thought this party was for the team.

13:04.226 --> 13:06.228
So you go behind my back and turn into my worst nightmare.

13:06.269 --> 13:09.403
Oh, no, Dan. Your worst nightmare is what’ll happen if they show up

13:09.458 --> 13:12.284
and you do anything to make them feel uncomfortable in our home.

13:22.228 --> 13:26.160
Hey, guys, maybe we should have, like, a signal. You know, in case one of us wants to leave.

13:26.754 --> 13:28.038
Maybe we should just leave.

13:28.238 --> 13:31.240
Oh, come on. That’s no fun. How about "caw"!

13:31.919 --> 13:32.636
"Caw"?

13:33.276 --> 13:34.909
Yeah. You know, like a raven. Caw!

13:35.422 --> 13:36.088
Caw!

13:37.460 --> 13:41.265
That’s the spirit. So, when one of us wants to leave, we just "caw."

13:41.326 --> 13:41.949
Caw!

13:42.637 --> 13:43.446
Caw!

13:48.933 --> 13:49.671
You ready, mom?

13:50.199 --> 13:51.391
Ready as I’ll ever be.

13:53.470 --> 13:58.206
You know, maybe the best plan is to just avoid him all night, and then that way…

14:01.058 --> 14:01.872
Come on in.

14:11.666 --> 14:12.358
Spirit.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.996
The vital principle and animating force within every human being.

14:17.827 --> 14:21.682
Of course, for some of you, spirit simply means alcoholic beverages.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.659
But this Ravens basketball team

14:26.782 --> 14:28.266
has a surplus of spirit.

14:28.615 --> 14:31.123
It’s an incredible team with an incredible group of young men.

14:31.793 --> 14:36.202
Except for their crushing defeat by the fathers this year, this team has been on a roll.

14:39.121 --> 14:39.737
Well…

14:40.432 --> 14:44.374
- Oh, it is so on tonight.
- … my lovely wife for setting up this party.

14:44.446 --> 14:46.771
Look at this, please.

14:47.994 --> 14:50.917
But Raven team spirit also includes the parents

14:51.389 --> 14:56.058
and the local businesses, whose financial support make this team great.

14:56.652 --> 14:59.689
Tonight’s for you. Enjoy.

15:01.086 --> 15:04.486
And here’s to our host, Dan Scott.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.967
- Here, here!
- My parents are such suck-ups.

15:09.007 --> 15:11.741
So, what public humiliation you got planned for "Pukas" tonight?

15:12.590 --> 15:16.261
Nothing, Tim. It’s a little played out, don’t you think?

15:16.815 --> 15:17.598
Since when?

15:24.045 --> 15:27.202
You had a little sin of omission there in your speech, Danny boy.

15:28.186 --> 15:29.742
Didn’t I mention the coaching staff?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.185
If you did, I didn’t hear it. Here…

15:32.770 --> 15:33.910
you’re out of cashews.

15:42.007 --> 15:45.410
I’m gonna grab a drink at the bar before it fills up. You go talk to Nathan.

15:45.775 --> 15:47.131
See how he’s been looking at you?

16:07.176 --> 16:08.348
They’re never gonna serve you.

16:08.461 --> 16:10.611
Watch and learn. Bartenders love me.

16:14.379 --> 16:15.644
Soda or juice?

16:16.689 --> 16:19.658
Actually, I was gonna ask if you knew how to make a screaming orgasm.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.595
For a pretty girl like you, sure.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.653
So, what is this thing tonight?

16:27.012 --> 16:28.209
Ravens basketball.

16:28.746 --> 16:29.258
Oh.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.566
And what position do you play?

16:34.466 --> 16:35.444
Cheerleader.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.514
Jocks and cheerleaders. Lots of hormones tonight.

16:42.258 --> 16:43.661
Don’t go around advertising.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.858
Secret’s safe with me.

16:48.369 --> 16:49.778
I’ll have what she’s having.

16:50.308 --> 16:53.886
Right. Soda or juice?

16:58.949 --> 17:03.081
You would think that after 20 years, your brother’s ego would cease to amaze me.

17:03.441 --> 17:04.780
Try a lifetime.

17:05.836 --> 17:07.470
Hi. I’ll take a white wine, please.

17:07.710 --> 17:08.781
I’ll have club soda.

17:09.528 --> 17:14.571
Hey, Laurie, pour me a double shot of your best top-shelf bourbon, would you, please?

17:16.318 --> 17:17.843
- Hello, Keith.
- Hey, Whitey.

17:19.425 --> 17:21.723
Well, Karen Roe.

17:22.527 --> 17:23.377
Look at you.

17:24.181 --> 17:25.092
Coach Durham.

17:25.819 --> 17:28.021
Most grown-ups call me Whitey.

17:28.831 --> 17:30.945
It’s good to see you coming ‘round again.

17:31.339 --> 17:34.694
Seeing you in my gym really turns back the clock.

17:36.019 --> 17:37.022
For me, too.

17:37.841 --> 17:43.198
Well, in my humble opinion, you have raised a fine son.

17:44.328 --> 17:45.430
You should be proud,

17:46.638 --> 17:48.108
and not just of the boy.

17:49.314 --> 17:50.350
Thank you.

18:12.786 --> 18:16.123
You  know, there are some states that could arrest you for what you’re thinking about right now.

18:17.348 --> 18:18.061
How are you doing, Jake?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.195
I’m good. You do your thing, man.

18:21.444 --> 18:22.852
Hey, Jake, Lucas.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.780
Two handsome boys for the price of one.

18:26.487 --> 18:28.289
Hey, Brooke. Listen, I was gonna...

18:28.388 --> 18:31.392
Where are you going? I haven’t had the chance to invite you to the real party.

18:31.966 --> 18:33.338
It’s at my place, later.

18:33.537 --> 18:36.081
I’m only inviting the cool people, but I guess you can come.

18:37.230 --> 18:38.165
You too, Jake.

18:38.279 --> 18:40.941
Oh, thanks, Brooke, but I gotta cut out early tonight.

18:41.073 --> 18:42.232
Oh, like that’s a surprise.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.206
Obligations, man. I’ll see you, Luke.

18:45.314 --> 18:45.999
Take care, man.

18:46.116 --> 18:49.343
All right, Brooke. Just go easy, okay?

18:51.708 --> 18:53.778
Obligations? What is his deal?

18:53.863 --> 18:55.718
Look, I don’t know. Could you just excuse me?

18:55.825 --> 19:00.393
Well, I was gonna say, my parents usually close this place down every year,

19:00.694 --> 19:03.862
so if you wanted, we could go back to my place and start the party early.

19:05.537 --> 19:06.551
We have a Jacuzzi.

19:08.723 --> 19:13.213
- That sounds tempting, Brooke...
- We have a naked me in a Jacuzzi.

19:15.557 --> 19:19.935
Okay. Um, what if I told you there was someone else?

19:20.012 --> 19:21.626
Normally, I’d suggest a threesome,

19:22.055 --> 19:26.715
but I think the person you have in mind is getting back together with her old boyfriend.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.070
So, uh, did you get my messages?

19:32.300 --> 19:33.574
Yeah, I got all of them.

19:34.204 --> 19:35.915
I don’t blame you for not calling me back.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.425
Are you being self-deprecating?

19:37.696 --> 19:40.523
Probably… if I knew what that meant.

19:43.656 --> 19:46.263
Do you want to, uh… Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

19:48.941 --> 19:50.886
Just to talk, Peyton.

19:55.723 --> 19:56.825
Just to talk.

20:02.966 --> 20:04.611
See what I mean?

20:16.548 --> 20:20.081
Karen Roe… in Dan Scott’s house…

20:20.494 --> 20:22.508
with Keith Scott as her date.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.092
Nothing gets past you, Shari.

20:25.748 --> 20:28.073
- Well, Keith and I are just friends.
- Oh, of course you are.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.002
Um, one Scott brother to the next-

20:31.467 --> 20:34.405
You practically need a scorecard around here to keep up with you people.

20:34.493 --> 20:37.718
Karen, there you are. I need your expert opinion in the kitchen.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.639
- Excuse us, Shari.
- Oh, yeah.

20:40.688 --> 20:42.143
You’re lucky she didn’t knee you.

20:47.825 --> 20:50.929
So, I see you smiling at school a lot. That’s good.

20:51.737 --> 20:52.507
You’ve been looking?

20:53.422 --> 20:54.421
Yeah, sometimes.

21:00.012 --> 21:04.312
Anyway, uh… Look, I don’t know if Brooke is just playing games or what.

21:04.773 --> 21:06.896
She said you were into us getting back together.

21:07.943 --> 21:09.842
Funny. She told me the same thing.

21:11.675 --> 21:12.299
Right.

21:13.570 --> 21:14.619
Look, the thing is…

21:16.463 --> 21:18.945
Oh. Sorry. We’ll come back.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.569
But there’s vodka in the drawer.

21:20.636 --> 21:23.262
Tim, later. These two need some space.

21:23.523 --> 21:25.331
You know what, Brooke? Give it up.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.276
Trust me, I’m trying.

21:27.768 --> 21:30.010
- You know what I mean.
- I’m just trying to help.

21:30.190 --> 21:31.056
Help with what?

21:31.448 --> 21:34.393
Get me out of the way so you can go embarrass yourself in front of Lucas?

21:36.876 --> 21:39.232
That’s funny. I didn’t realize you were in my way.

21:40.337 --> 21:41.556
Are you finally fessing up?

21:43.149 --> 21:45.094
Or, are you finally denying it?

21:55.446 --> 21:56.916
What the hell is wrong with you, Brooke?

22:29.179 --> 22:32.920
Nathan, Believing you will do well is half the battle… Call me if you need anything at all! Haley

22:39.780 --> 22:40.749
Perfect.

22:44.998 --> 22:46.370
Thought I’d find you near the bar.

22:49.038 --> 22:49.908
It’s club soda.

22:50.523 --> 22:52.155
Well, that’s a good thing considering.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.168
How ‘bout we don’t do this right now, huh?

22:54.297 --> 22:55.731
How about you meet me halfway.

22:56.406 --> 22:59.898
I say I'm sorry, you say you're sorry, we shake hands and go from there.

23:01.802 --> 23:02.785
It works for me.

23:02.888 --> 23:06.150
Well, you see, that’s the problem, Dan. It always has to work for you.

23:06.631 --> 23:08.873
Okay. How ‘bout we don’t do this right now.

23:12.356 --> 23:16.087
You in the mood to apologize, Dan? Why don’t you start with Karen

23:16.733 --> 23:19.154
or Lucas or maybe even Nathan, hmm?

23:19.333 --> 23:21.054
I’m gonna do you a solid, big brother.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.435
Just walk away.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.735
This is a very nice kitchen.

23:31.984 --> 23:35.503
Oh, thanks. I’m afraid it’s wasted on me.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.930
Where did you learn to cook?

23:38.513 --> 23:41.227
Oh, books, trial and error,

23:42.062 --> 23:43.734
a lot of burnt casseroles.

23:44.796 --> 23:46.915
And I get to experiment a lot at the café.

23:47.033 --> 23:48.810
Oh, I’ll have to eat there some night.

23:49.485 --> 23:50.996
Don’t worry, I’ll come alone.

23:51.636 --> 23:58.286
Hi. There’s been a mix-up. The baker seems to have delivered the cakes to a bar mitzvah in Charlotte.

23:58.390 --> 24:02.009
You know, I have a lot of desserts at the café. I’d be happy to contribute.

24:02.101 --> 24:04.901
Oh no, I don’t want to put you to that trouble.

24:04.973 --> 24:07.514
No, no. It’s no trouble. I’ll call Haley.

24:08.901 --> 24:10.626
Haley? Um…

24:11.896 --> 24:13.528
is she a tutor, by any chance?

24:14.732 --> 24:15.966
Yeah, she is. Why?

24:16.145 --> 24:17.714
Oh, no. It’s a small world.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.058
She must be the girl who’s helping Nathan.

24:21.062 --> 24:22.944
Oh. She must be.

24:30.379 --> 24:31.747
Haven’t seen you much today.

24:32.478 --> 24:35.089
Yeah, I know. Every time I get within about five feet of you-

24:35.156 --> 24:36.012
Brooke happens.

24:36.821 --> 24:37.572
Or Nathan.

24:38.935 --> 24:39.872
Loose ends.

24:41.162 --> 24:42.304
Those are all tied up now.

24:45.242 --> 24:46.636
Looks like she got you

24:47.654 --> 24:48.621
right here.

24:50.042 --> 24:52.109
Listen up, everybody…

24:52.917 --> 24:54.510
it’s time to play truth or dare.

24:55.277 --> 24:59.153
Or maybe just dare, ‘cause nobody really tells the truth anymore.

25:01.151 --> 25:07.126
Let’s see… Theresa, I dare you…

25:08.759 --> 25:10.670
to go pinch Whitey’s ass.

25:13.705 --> 25:15.020
Be right back.

25:19.062 --> 25:21.999
- Let’s see… Peyton?
- Brooke, come on.

25:22.291 --> 25:26.480
I dare you to show us how you really feel. Kiss Lucas.

25:58.393 --> 25:59.964
Why are you being such a bitch tonight, Brooke?

26:01.741 --> 26:03.456
Well, I thought you liked that in a girl.

26:03.620 --> 26:04.987
You should put some ice on it.

26:23.169 --> 26:23.916
So that was…

26:25.406 --> 26:26.077
Yeah.

26:27.531 --> 26:29.523
What was that exactly?

26:30.541 --> 26:31.253
A game?

26:32.400 --> 26:33.070
Kind of.

26:37.879 --> 26:38.631
Not really.

26:41.049 --> 26:41.908
Want to play again?

26:52.850 --> 26:55.579
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I just…

26:56.459 --> 26:59.584
Your mom called with an SOS, so I just thought I’d sneak in the back

26:59.618 --> 27:02.040
- and not bother anyone. 
- You need some help?

27:02.599 --> 27:03.756
No. I’ll...

27:05.220 --> 27:06.294
You’ve got your hands full.

27:06.909 --> 27:08.901
So, I’m just gonna-carry on.

27:18.455 --> 27:20.691
Everything you need…

27:22.721 --> 27:24.195
for a first class sugar coma.

27:24.399 --> 27:26.176
Oh, let’s see.

27:27.435 --> 27:30.446
Oh, these cakes are gorgeous. Who makes them?

27:31.275 --> 27:32.300
These guys.

27:32.822 --> 27:35.783
Thank you, Haley. The caterers can take it from here.

27:36.796 --> 27:38.950
Go join your friends. Have some food.

27:39.064 --> 27:42.319
No, that’s okay. I have to get back, anyway. I’m still on the clock.

27:42.448 --> 27:44.850
Did you lock up when you left, turn off the coffee machine?

27:44.925 --> 27:45.489
Yeah.

27:45.821 --> 27:46.999
Well, then you’re off the clock.

27:47.251 --> 27:50.159
Great, then it’s settled. Uh, I’ll get some waiters to serve these.

27:53.199 --> 27:54.245
She seems kind of cool.

27:55.651 --> 27:56.507
How are you holding up?

27:56.953 --> 28:00.193
Well, I haven’t had to, uh-caw!-yet.

28:00.598 --> 28:02.165
Okay, whatever that means.

28:04.361 --> 28:05.898
- Haley?
- Hmm?

28:06.327 --> 28:08.498
Why didn’t you tell me it was Nathan you were tutoring?

28:09.103 --> 28:10.322
Oh, uh…

28:12.087 --> 28:13.663
it just seemed kind of weird.

28:14.207 --> 28:17.970
Lucas wasn’t really happy about it, so I just figured you wouldn’t be too happy about it.

28:18.119 --> 28:20.061
I wasn’t even sure if I was happy about it.

28:20.142 --> 28:20.889
And now?

28:21.474 --> 28:25.538
Um…now things are okay with Lucas and with me.

28:26.142 --> 28:27.007
And with me.

28:28.421 --> 28:29.741
Now go, have fun.

28:30.716 --> 28:32.348
It only comes around once.

28:33.238 --> 28:34.012
Okay.

28:42.399 --> 28:44.646
You know, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but, um,

28:45.691 --> 28:46.699
I’m glad I came.

28:49.212 --> 28:50.647
So, what do we do now?

28:52.798 --> 28:53.893
I don’t know.

28:54.313 --> 28:56.248
What happens next in the story you were telling me about?

28:59.254 --> 28:59.914
Come on.

29:09.284 --> 29:09.907
Haley?

29:10.969 --> 29:15.126
Hey! Um, I’m not crashing. I promise. Your mom just wanted some cakes.

29:15.888 --> 29:16.575
Cakes?

29:16.867 --> 29:20.766
Yeah. It’s a long story. She invited me to stay and I sort of had a brain freeze

29:20.818 --> 29:24.188
and said "sure"…and it’s probably really weird. I’m actually gonna leave.

29:24.285 --> 29:26.022
No, no, no. I’m glad you came.

29:26.566 --> 29:29.305
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I’d even study right now.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.607
It’d be a hell of a lot more fun than this suck-fest.

29:31.926 --> 29:35.176
- Sorry. I’m off-duty.
- Well, then let me get you a drink.

29:35.616 --> 29:36.359
Okay.

29:37.997 --> 29:39.108
Tutor girl!

29:40.343 --> 29:41.603
- It’s Haley.
- Brooke…

29:41.786 --> 29:46.302
Haley, right. Nathan’s own personal little care package.

29:46.389 --> 29:49.027
Everything’s starting to make so much more sense now.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.818
You two are adorable.

29:51.301 --> 29:56.414
What was my favorite part? "Believing you’ll do well is half the battle…"

29:56.614 --> 30:00.398
You know, Tutor Girl’s little love note you passed around earlier-

30:00.525 --> 30:06.102
the one that said, "Call me if you need anything… at all."

30:06.991 --> 30:09.727
All right, Haley, I...

30:09.788 --> 30:10.899
Stay away from me.

30:17.131 --> 30:18.691
Games are getting old, Brooke.

30:24.349 --> 30:27.555
Cover me. Shari’s proposing a couples cruise.

30:27.657 --> 30:28.538
Oh no.

30:32.484 --> 30:36.355
I have to confess something. I have been pretty judgmental about you.

30:37.917 --> 30:41.144
- How could you not be? 
- I really didn’t want to like you.

30:42.398 --> 30:44.518
I’m hoping there’s a "but" in there somewhere.

30:44.999 --> 30:47.850
There is. I was wrong.

30:48.521 --> 30:51.542
I’m really glad I’ve had this chance to get to know you.

30:51.655 --> 30:54.321
Oh, that make’s two of us.

30:56.150 --> 30:59.627
There are so many questions.

30:59.852 --> 31:01.423
That makes two of us again.

31:02.601 --> 31:03.333
You start.

31:03.983 --> 31:08.075
When you met Dan, did he tell you about me?

31:08.740 --> 31:11.311
He said he’d had a girlfriend in high school.

31:13.298 --> 31:17.178
- Did you know I was pregnant?
- He conveniently left that out.

31:17.705 --> 31:21.679
I didn’t find out about you until we were married and living in Tree Hill.

31:22.391 --> 31:24.980
- Oh, I would’ve killed him.
- Oh, I almost did.

31:27.343 --> 31:32.615
- So when did you...
- Dan and I met at Freshman Orientation.

31:34.162 --> 31:37.576
That was about a month after I told him I was pregnant.

31:38.181 --> 31:39.968
A few months later, I was pregnant, too.

31:41.570 --> 31:44.965
You know Dan, always the overachiever.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.989
Don’t take this the wrong way, Karen.

31:52.123 --> 31:54.784
But I’m glad I didn’t know about you back then

31:57.105 --> 32:00.469
because if I did I wouldn’t have Nathan.

32:03.259 --> 32:04.462
I know what you mean.

32:07.155 --> 32:08.292
I love my son,

32:09.501 --> 32:13.064
but sometimes I wonder how I could have been that reckless.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.140
We were kids.

32:29.623 --> 32:30.540
Don’t need this...

32:32.993 --> 32:34.323
or this.

32:46.771 --> 32:48.306
I’ve wanted this for so long.

32:48.572 --> 32:51.818
Me too. And now we can have it.

32:51.956 --> 32:54.220
No, no, no. I don’t mean just that.

32:55.224 --> 32:56.529
I want this.

32:58.963 --> 33:02.453
You know? I want to be here.

33:04.654 --> 33:08.014
I want to have everything with you. I want it all.

33:12.432 --> 33:14.863
I want us, Peyton.

33:16.016 --> 33:17.516
Hey, what’s wrong?

33:18.965 --> 33:21.161
- This isn’t supposed to be that.
- Peyton...

33:21.515 --> 33:23.035
Why couldn’t you just leave it alone?

33:44.101 --> 33:45.220
Interesting.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.733
You’ve always made me out to be the bad guy.

33:50.242 --> 33:51.922
Maybe you’ll judge me a little different now.

33:51.995 --> 33:52.879
Spare me a lecture.

33:53.224 --> 33:54.954
Just trying to give you the benefit of my experience.

33:55.056 --> 33:58.979
In what-fathering a child… or abandoning one?

34:01.938 --> 34:04.230
Seems to me you’re one mistake away from both.

34:04.298 --> 34:07.217
Yeah, well, one’s an accident.

34:08.451 --> 34:09.581
The other’s a choice.

34:10.926 --> 34:12.197
Excuse me.

34:21.007 --> 34:21.799
Excuse me.

34:24.143 --> 34:24.998
"Caw?"

34:25.444 --> 34:27.956
Hey, listen, you guys can stay if you want. I think I’m gonna cut out.

34:28.043 --> 34:31.505
- What happened?
- Nothing. I’m just done is all.

34:31.771 --> 34:33.129
All right. Well, let me go grab my coat.

34:33.297 --> 34:36.570
Hey, take your time. You guys go ahead. I’ll be in the car, all right?

34:41.418 --> 34:43.420
- Lucas…
- Come on, Brooke. Not now.

34:47.578 --> 34:48.293
Jake…

34:49.467 --> 34:51.039
Jake, Jake, Jake.

34:51.192 --> 34:52.877
Oh, Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.263
I’m drunk. You’ll do.

34:55.353 --> 34:59.952
Oh, oh, hey, um, it’s quite an honor, but I got to be somewhere.

35:00.249 --> 35:03.246
Oh, right-the big mystery.

35:04.244 --> 35:07.433
- Yeah. Anyway, I should... 
- What’s going on anyway?

35:08.324 --> 35:11.570
Lucas turns me down. You turn me down.

35:12.139 --> 35:15.892
Oh, my god! I got it! You’re both gay. That totally explains it.

35:16.111 --> 35:19.092
Yeah, yeah, we are. We’re actually-we’re gay.

35:19.762 --> 35:20.955
Whatever you say, Brooke.

35:21.425 --> 35:22.589
Then what is it?

35:23.208 --> 35:25.983
Come on, you can tell me. I won’t even remember tomorrow.

35:26.453 --> 35:27.217
You want to know?

35:30.033 --> 35:32.086
The truth would kill your buzz.

35:38.852 --> 35:41.226
Deb put this room together for me a few Christmas’s ago.

35:41.563 --> 35:42.347
It’s nice.

35:43.504 --> 35:45.443
Anyway, I just came to get my coat.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.870
Karen, why are you doing this?

35:48.444 --> 35:49.073
For Lucas.

35:50.784 --> 35:51.762
And for me.

35:52.008 --> 35:54.492
For you? What do you get out of it?

35:54.782 --> 35:55.796
I get to move on.

35:57.344 --> 35:58.853
And that’s pretty liberating.

36:03.119 --> 36:06.345
Look around you, Dan. You have a wonderful life.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.113
Why are you spending it stuck in the past?

36:23.238 --> 36:24.061
Haley?

36:29.727 --> 36:30.762
Hey, Hales!

36:37.817 --> 36:38.896
Is this floor taken?

36:47.007 --> 36:51.719
You know, just this once, I deserve a big, fat "I told you so."

36:52.589 --> 36:54.114
Well, you won’t get it from me.

36:55.445 --> 36:56.250
What happened?

36:57.750 --> 37:00.079
Exactly what you told me was gonna happen.

37:01.938 --> 37:05.773
I started believing that he wasn’t terrible, and he proved me wrong.

37:06.045 --> 37:10.970
Once again, the smart girl is really stupid.

37:11.052 --> 37:12.064
Hey, hey.

37:16.002 --> 37:17.493
You are not stupid.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.319
Thanks.

37:24.196 --> 37:27.456
Well, at least things are working out for one of us.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.479
It looks like you and Peyton are headed in the right direction.

37:29.607 --> 37:30.942
Well, if it’ll make you feel better,

37:32.198 --> 37:34.558
that lasted all of about five minutes.

37:36.467 --> 37:38.588
It doesn’t make me feel any better.

37:41.091 --> 37:42.233
Well, welcome back.

37:43.473 --> 37:44.184
To where?

37:45.145 --> 37:45.775
Normal.

37:47.690 --> 37:48.387
Yeah.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.070
They can have their world.

37:55.335 --> 37:57.409
Come on. Let me help you close up.

37:57.511 --> 37:59.887
No, thanks. I’ll do it. I just…

38:00.763 --> 38:03.343
I just want to be alone for a little while, okay?

38:04.566 --> 38:07.664
I’ll be fine. I’ll be okay. I’m okay.

38:08.631 --> 38:09.543
All right.

38:23.696 --> 38:25.405
Great party, as always, Dan.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.577
Oh, thanks, Peter.

38:26.649 --> 38:30.735
Deb, honey, you got to send me the number for the caterer. Those cakes were to die for.

38:30.838 --> 38:33.692
Oh, it’s in the book under "Karen’s Café."

38:34.192 --> 38:36.664
Really? Well, who knew?

38:38.744 --> 38:40.068
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

38:41.963 --> 38:44.467
So, was it all you wanted it to be?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.319
‘Cause, I think it’s the first year I’ve actually enjoyed myself.

38:48.308 --> 38:50.150
Might have even made a new friend.

38:51.988 --> 38:52.663
I noticed.

38:55.777 --> 38:58.393
Thank you for being on your best behavior.

38:59.377 --> 39:01.348
You really stepped up.

39:06.161 --> 39:06.883
Did I?

39:08.748 --> 39:11.260
‘Cause I can’t ever remember feeling more off-balance.

39:50.465 --> 39:51.341
Hey.

39:59.284 --> 40:00.115
Can I come in?

40:07.140 --> 40:09.362
Haley, I didn’t know.

40:09.946 --> 40:10.930
Come on.

40:12.789 --> 40:14.589
Please, you got to believe me.

40:52.343 --> 40:53.637
Sweet dreams, baby.

40:54.790 --> 40:56.635
Daddy loves you, all right?
