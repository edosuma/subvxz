Now that I have this
you cannot catch me, Batman.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.207
Or you, weird flying kid.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.176
My name is Blue Beetle.

BATMAN: Focus Beetle.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.490
If you want to be part
of the Justice League

01:31.525 --> 01:34.560
you don't pose and
you don't work on impulse.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.562
You plan ahead.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.633
I can't believe we blew it
in front of Batman.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.969

-Fine, I blew it.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.749
My first case,
Carmine Falcone.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.784
He ran the Falcone
crime family.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.520
Kidnapping, smuggling,
racketeering, you name it,

02:35.555 --> 02:37.189
Carmine was behind it.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.991
I took him down.

02:40.026 --> 02:43.161
Why does Chronos have
clippings of your first case?

Chronos.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.874
(LAUGHS) Out of time, Batman.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.413
Beetle, no!

03:21.434 --> 03:22.801
What was that?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.854
So we went through
that light thingy

03:42.889 --> 03:44.723
and now everything
looks newer?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.226
That light thingy
was a time portal.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.999
That's the Falcone
family warehouse.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.568
This was my first case.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.471
Now we know why he was
collecting data on me.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.607
I learnt Carmine was,
is holding a meeting

04:02.642 --> 04:05.443
with the heads of his
criminal enterprises tonight.

04:05.478 --> 04:09.147
So we have to stop Chronos
before he changes
anything in the past

04:09.182 --> 04:11.216
and boom, home free, right?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.751
We also have to be careful.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.620
If anyone sees us,
especially my younger self,

04:15.655 --> 04:17.155
we could create a paradox.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.624
It endangers our future
and the entire time stream.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.593
And erase you from history!

04:22.862 --> 04:24.562
So no biggie?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.799
This is exactly what I mean
when I say crime-fighting
is not a game.

(DOOR OPENS)

04:43.283 --> 04:45.317

Got it that time.

05:21.187 --> 05:24.222
I am vengeance.
I am the knight.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.658
I am Batman.

05:30.930 --> 05:35.834

you said we don't pose.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.702
-We...
-We're not talking about it.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.705
-(LAUGHING) But that,
"I am vengeance."
-Moving on.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.108
-"I am the knight?"
-We're done now.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.410
The Falcones' meeting
is in 10 minutes,

05:45.445 --> 05:48.113
which means we have to move.

told me a nutjob
dressed like a bat,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.548
was going to crash our meeting

06:23.583 --> 06:24.783
I was skeptical.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.018
But what do you know.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.155
Looks like we have ourselves
a vermin problem.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.725
Your reign of terror
ends tonight, Carmine.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.895
(LAUGHS) I think you
got it backwards, Bat.

erased from history!

06:53.947 --> 06:55.881
-You keep forgetting about me.
-No!

07:06.893 --> 07:10.929
You dropped all my time
bombs, weird flying kid.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.431
It's Blue Beetle.

going to do. Hoo-hoo!
