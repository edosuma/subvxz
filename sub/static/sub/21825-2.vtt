WEBVTT

00:07.240 --> 00:08.541
(door chimes)

00:08.574 --> 00:10.843
Come in.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.147
Good day, Captain.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.648
Bortus. How are you?

00:15.681 --> 00:18.985
I apologize for intruding
upon your work.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.153
Oh, no, it's fine.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.322
What is that?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.324
That is, uh,

00:24.357 --> 00:26.326
Kermit the Frog.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.394
I do not recognize the species.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.031
It's an amphibious life-form
from Earth.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.432
Is it someone you know?

00:32.465 --> 00:35.601
No, no, he's just a leader
I admire.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.937
Always keeps his cool

00:36.970 --> 00:38.271
in a crisis,

00:38.304 --> 00:39.772
inspires greatness
in his people.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.574
He's...

00:41.607 --> 00:43.109
So, what can I do for you?

00:43.143 --> 00:47.247
Sir, I wish to request
a leave of absence.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.448
For what reason?

00:48.481 --> 00:50.383
I have laid an egg.

00:50.416 --> 00:52.452
(chuckling):
You...

00:52.485 --> 00:54.620
What do you mean,
like you told a bad joke

00:54.654 --> 00:55.788
or something? Like, what?

00:55.821 --> 00:58.724
No, sir. Moclans reproduce
by laying eggs.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.226
Klyden and I

01:00.260 --> 01:01.894
are going to have a child.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.730
Bortus, that's great.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.566
Congrats. My God.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.368
You lay eggs?
Yes, sir.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.769
Wow. You know, I always wondered

01:09.802 --> 01:12.805
how a single-gender species
populated itself, but...

01:12.838 --> 01:15.541
Are-are they big? They big eggs?

01:15.575 --> 01:17.610
They are somewhat large.
Yes, sir.

01:17.643 --> 01:18.811
Amazing.

01:18.844 --> 01:21.647
Um, well, yeah,
take all the time off you need.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.985
The gestation period
is approximately 21 days.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.452
And you sit on it?

01:26.486 --> 01:27.787
You sit on the egg?

01:27.820 --> 01:28.788
Yes, sir.

01:28.821 --> 01:30.556
Wow.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.292
Well, listen,
tell Klyden congrats,

01:32.325 --> 01:34.627
and, uh, if you
got one more in you,

01:34.660 --> 01:36.729
dibs on the omelet. (laughs)

01:36.762 --> 01:37.897
Sir?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.799
Sorry. Bad joke.

01:39.832 --> 01:40.900
Yes.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.635
Bad "yolk." (laughs)

01:44.204 --> 01:46.172
You know,
I'm-I'm just not gonna try

01:46.206 --> 01:48.141
at comedy with you anymore.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.076
I will return to my quarters.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.177
Okay.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.983
(sighs)

01:59.552 --> 02:00.853
(exhales)

02:00.886 --> 02:02.989
I want eggs now.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.358
♪

02:37.823 --> 02:40.160
♪

03:04.950 --> 03:07.253
♪

03:12.192 --> 03:13.593
Eggs?

03:13.626 --> 03:14.827
That's what he said.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.097
Moclans reproduce
by laying eggs,

03:17.130 --> 03:18.431
which I never knew.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.732
Well, where does
it come out of?

03:19.765 --> 03:21.267
The butt?

03:21.301 --> 03:22.835
You know, John,
I didn't really pry

03:22.868 --> 03:24.337
into those kinds of specifics.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.772
How's that not the first thing you ask?
(signal chimes)

03:26.806 --> 03:29.275
Captain, we are receiving
a distress signal.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.512
Coordinates 8-3-0-4-9-3-4.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.879
A transport ship
has been attacked

03:33.913 --> 03:35.248
by the Krill.
How far away?

03:35.281 --> 03:38.684
With quantum drive at maximum,
six minutes, 21 seconds.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.453
Alara, send a message
we're on our way.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.122
Gordon, get us there
as quick as you can.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.156
Aye, sir.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.800
Approaching the transport,
sir, it's the USS Bleriot.

03:54.834 --> 03:55.768
Let's see it.

03:57.803 --> 03:59.139
Looks like they took
a hell of a beating.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.741
Scan for life signs. How many
passengers are on board?

04:01.774 --> 04:04.710
Captain, the ship is
already scanning us.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.745
They are?

04:05.778 --> 04:06.979
That's weird.

04:07.012 --> 04:09.449
That's like a jinx, right?
They owe us a Coke.

04:09.482 --> 04:10.483
Alara, hail them.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.218
Channel open.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.154
Bleriot, this is
Captain Ed Mercer

04:14.187 --> 04:16.156
of the USS Orville--
do you read me?

04:16.189 --> 04:18.991
Captain Mercer, we've been
raided by a Krill destroyer.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.660
What is the status
of your vessel?

04:20.693 --> 04:21.794
Our injured are being treated,

04:21.827 --> 04:23.496
but we're in need
of extensive repairs.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.266
I can hear you, but visual is
a little patchy.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.833
That's why we scanned your ship.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.769
All right, send us a manifest
of everything you need

04:29.802 --> 04:31.604
as soon as you can.
Sending now.

04:31.637 --> 04:34.507
And, Captain, it so happens
we're carrying two passengers

04:34.540 --> 04:35.675
whom you know.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.444
Eddie, is that you?

04:38.478 --> 04:40.112
Mom?

04:40.146 --> 04:42.815
Hey, buddy.
Surprise, huh?

04:42.848 --> 04:45.084
Yeah, it is.
Dad, are you guys okay?

04:45.117 --> 04:46.486
No, no, we're okay, fine.
We're okay.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.589
We all just got a bit of a
scare, that's all. Yeah.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.624
Well, except for your father.

04:51.657 --> 04:54.594
Yeah. I-I slept through
the entire attack,

04:54.627 --> 04:56.496
and I just woke up
a little while ago.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.364
You know, a little too much
of the sauce last night.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.633
Mom, Dad, what the hell are
you guys doing on the Bleriot?

05:00.666 --> 05:02.435
Well, your father and I wanted

05:02.468 --> 05:03.969
to spend the weekend
on Deneb 3

05:04.003 --> 05:05.305
with the Petersons.
With the Petersons.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.772
We're receiving
the manifest now.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.808
Who's that?
Is that Kelly?

05:08.841 --> 05:09.975
Yeah.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.477
Hi, Mrs. Mercer.
How are you?

05:11.511 --> 05:14.647
I'm fine.
You know, uh, Eddie tells us

05:14.680 --> 05:16.482
you're just a wonderful
first officer.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.951
I'm-I'm glad
you two are friends again,

05:18.984 --> 05:21.554
after the, um, infidelity.

05:21.587 --> 05:24.056
MR. MERCER: Okay.
Yeah. No, no,

05:24.089 --> 05:25.725
we're... we're fine.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.360
Was it worth it?
Aw, Jeannie...

05:27.393 --> 05:28.961
just drop it, huh?

05:28.994 --> 05:30.129
A honey like that,
a couple of flies are

05:30.162 --> 05:31.364
gonna get through, okay?

05:31.397 --> 05:32.965
Uh, guys,
you-you remember Gordon?

05:32.998 --> 05:34.800
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. M.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.968
Is that Gordon?

05:36.001 --> 05:37.069
It's me, yeah.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.405
Oh, okay, well,
tell him I said hi.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.541
He just heard you, Dad.
Hi.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.309
Who's that?
That's Gordon again.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.977
Eddie, how's your stomach?
Is it still bothering you?

05:45.010 --> 05:47.980
Uh, it-it's fine, Mom.
It's-it's okay.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.482
Did you get the colon scan?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.150
I-I will.
I will get it.

05:51.183 --> 05:53.419
Listen to me.
You get the colon scan.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.821
Do you understand me?
Because if you get the divert--

05:55.855 --> 05:58.924
Man, what is that?
Diverticulitis.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.327
Diverticulitis, like I had,
that's not a picnic.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.562
What is it
you got stuck in there?

06:02.595 --> 06:03.663
A sesame seed.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.098
A sesame seed in his colon!
In the colon.

06:06.131 --> 06:08.434
Yeah. It-It just
gets stuck in there,

06:08.468 --> 06:09.669
because there are
folds, you know?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.437
Yeah. And it burrows in
there for the winter,

06:11.471 --> 06:14.240
and you got yourself an inflammation.
Oh, God.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.508
Hey, you know what, guys?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.742
We're just gonna come over
there, okay? How does that...?

06:16.776 --> 06:18.278
Right, Kel? You haven't seen
Mom and Dad in a while...

06:18.311 --> 06:19.279
I haven't seen them
in ages, yes.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.946
Great!
Yeah.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.615
Much better if we go down there and
help out. Great, much better, great.

06:22.648 --> 06:23.683
So we'll see you
in a bit, okay?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.117
Get the scan.

06:25.150 --> 06:28.621
Oh, my God.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.123
Alara, you have the conn.
Aye.

06:31.156 --> 06:32.558
Wait, what?

06:32.592 --> 06:34.460
You have command
while we're gone.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.195
Well, what about Bortus?

06:36.228 --> 06:38.298
Bortus is in his quarters
warming an egg.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.965
That makes you
the ranking bridge officer.

06:39.999 --> 06:43.703
Oh, yeah, but...
I've never, um...

06:43.736 --> 06:45.104
KELLY:
Wait,

06:45.137 --> 06:46.706
this is your
first time in command.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.808
Yeah, so maybe
someone else should...

06:48.841 --> 06:51.110
You got this, okay?

06:51.143 --> 06:52.445
You wouldn't be allowed
to wear that uniform

06:52.478 --> 06:54.280
if you weren't qualified.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.615
We trust you.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.551
Yeah.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.552
Okay.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.521
Okay.
Okay.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.158
Oh, hey, uh, sorry
about my parents, everyone.

07:06.191 --> 07:08.428
They're, um...

07:08.461 --> 07:11.597
My colon is fine,
by the way, there's...

07:11.631 --> 07:13.198
Yeah.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.168
(door whooshes open)

07:16.201 --> 07:18.170
(door whooshes shut)

07:36.722 --> 07:38.358
Your mother hates me.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.793
She does not hate you.
Oh, yes, she does.

07:40.826 --> 07:43.529
She does not. She hated you
a little bit after the...

07:43.563 --> 07:46.499
the thing.

07:46.532 --> 07:47.833
You can tell me,
you know.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.202
I mean, we never
talked about it.

07:50.235 --> 07:53.038
What'd she say about me?
It's nothing too terrible.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.474
You can tell me. Just be honest.
It wasn't that bad.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.141
Be honest.
She once called you a bitch

07:56.175 --> 07:58.944
46 times in one sitting.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.713
Wow.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.314
Yeah, the people at
the next table complained.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.650
But, look, Kel, it doesn't
matter. You know?

08:04.684 --> 08:07.387
That's the past-- you and I were
a lousy match, movin' on.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.123
Maybe. We never really
got the chance to find out.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.726
Well, that's what happens when
you let a blue alien bone you

08:13.759 --> 08:15.327
while your husband's at work, isn't it?
Don't be a jerk.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.296
In no way am I trying
to be a jerk.

08:17.329 --> 08:19.965
Honestly, Kel, most guys
would hold a grudge

08:19.999 --> 08:22.134
for something like this--
I think you did us a favor.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.303
I really do.
In fact, you know what?

08:24.336 --> 08:26.739
I want to thank you
for your infidelity.

08:26.772 --> 08:31.744
Look, all I'm saying is that
if you hadn't been so absent,

08:31.777 --> 08:35.314
and I hadn't...
done what I did...

08:35.347 --> 08:36.482
maybe it could've worked.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.152
I say this with all due
respect-- you are high.

08:40.185 --> 08:43.723
Well, since we are seeing your
mother, that's not a bad idea.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.325
What are you doing?

08:46.358 --> 08:48.928
(beep)
One cannabis edible.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.763
ED:
Oh, my God. Seriously?

08:50.796 --> 08:52.264
You're kidding
with that, right?

08:52.297 --> 08:54.967
Just in case.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.959
What the hell?

09:19.992 --> 09:21.994
What is this?

09:30.636 --> 09:31.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys!

09:31.737 --> 09:33.639
Guys!
Isaac!

09:33.673 --> 09:35.441
The transport--
what happened to it?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.777
Scanners show no sign
of the ship.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.479
It appears to have been
a holographic projection

09:39.512 --> 09:41.080
of some kind.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.849
What about the boarding party?
Searching.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.152
Scans show
no life signs.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.489
They are gone.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.236
I don't understand,
how can they just be gone?

10:04.269 --> 10:06.271
John, wha-what about
long-range navigational scans?

10:06.305 --> 10:07.640
I'm checking right now.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.174
There's-There's nothing
out there.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.175
Not a damn thing.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.681
(panting)

10:26.391 --> 10:29.328
Commander, the captain...
Oh, God.

10:29.361 --> 10:31.797
Is it not customary
to request permission

10:31.831 --> 10:33.833
before entering
someone else's quarters?

10:33.866 --> 10:36.502
It is...
I am brooding my egg.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.538
It is a private time
for a Moclan.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.172
Sir, I am so sorry,

10:40.205 --> 10:42.374
but the captain and
the first officer are gone!

10:42.407 --> 10:44.476
Gone?
Where?

10:44.510 --> 10:45.711
We don't know.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.279
We got a distress call
from a transport ship,

10:47.312 --> 10:49.549
and once they boarded it, the
whole thing just disappeared.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.350
Who is in command?

10:51.383 --> 10:53.285
I am.

10:53.318 --> 10:56.321
Then, if they are alive,
you must find them.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.524
Sir, if you could just
come back to the bridge.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.125
The captain never would have
left me in command

11:00.159 --> 11:01.126
if he had any idea that this...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.128
I cannot leave my egg.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.296
For how long?

11:04.329 --> 11:05.464
For 21 days.

11:05.497 --> 11:08.634
I am sorry,
Lieutenant.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.070
I will not risk the life
of my child.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.405
You must remain
in command.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.762
One shot of Xelayan tequila.

11:44.469 --> 11:46.906
Okay.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.074
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.209
You're okay.
You're fine.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.778
You gonna throw up?
You gonna throw up?

11:52.812 --> 11:56.949
No. You're all right.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.550
(gags)

11:58.584 --> 12:01.486
(retching, coughing)

12:09.161 --> 12:11.363
Lieutenant, you all right?

12:11.396 --> 12:15.467
Yes!
Yes, yes, I'm fine, Ensign...

12:15.500 --> 12:17.937
Parker. Parker. Ensign Parker.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.939
Sweet. Go away now.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.741
Oh.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.379
(sighs quickly)

12:27.412 --> 12:29.615
Isaac, any sign
of the boarding party?

12:29.649 --> 12:32.451
Negative, sir.
Status unchanged.

12:32.484 --> 12:33.719
GORDON:
Sir, there's nobody over there

12:33.753 --> 12:35.621
to pilot the shuttle
back to us,

12:35.655 --> 12:38.490
but I can bring it over by
remote guidance, on your order.

12:38.523 --> 12:40.592
Got it.

12:41.661 --> 12:46.065
Is...
is the order given?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.467
Yes.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.069
Absolutely do that.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.671
Aye, sir.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.307
And good job...

12:55.340 --> 12:56.441
with that remote thing.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.112
Thanks.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.187
Sir?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.622
Doctor. Hi.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.957
Any word?

13:11.991 --> 13:13.793
No, nothing yet.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.260
What's next?

13:15.294 --> 13:20.265
What's next... is...

13:20.299 --> 13:21.967
we should

13:22.001 --> 13:23.769
lock a tractor
beam onto the buoy

13:23.803 --> 13:26.205
and bring it into the shuttle
bay to examine it for clues.

13:26.238 --> 13:30.042
We got Dora the Explorer
runnin' the show here. Shh.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.777
Lieutenant Lamarr, do you
want to say something?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.312
No, sir.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.214
Good. Lock onto the buoy.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.050
Sir, I would advise against
that course of action.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.219
We are not familiar
with its defense mechanisms.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.054
It's our only chance
to find our people.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.723
Lieutenant, lock on.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.058
Aye, sir.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.397
Locked on and
pulling her in.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.402
Bridge to shuttle bay.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.838
Prepare to receive buoy.

13:58.871 --> 14:03.175
Copy, bridge.
Opening bay doors.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.654
Sir, I'm reading an energy
buildup within the buoy's core.

14:15.687 --> 14:17.022
Can you identify it?

14:17.056 --> 14:18.423
It is...
(alarm sounds)

14:18.457 --> 14:21.260
Sir, deactivate
the tractor beam!

14:21.293 --> 14:23.262
(explosion)

14:23.295 --> 14:25.130
(grunting)

14:32.304 --> 14:33.773
Get those doors shut!

14:42.714 --> 14:45.117
ISAAC:
All sections reporting.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.020
Structural damage is extensive,
injuries are numerous.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.854
I'll be in sickbay.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.089
Bortus to bridge.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.223
What is happening?

14:51.256 --> 14:52.591
We, uh, took a little jolt,

14:52.624 --> 14:53.926
but we're in one piece.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.027
Is your egg okay?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.461
It is intact.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.797
However, such impacts are not

14:57.830 --> 14:58.964
conducive to egg brooding!

14:58.998 --> 15:01.266
Sir, hull integrity has
been compromised

15:01.300 --> 15:03.302
in the shuttle bay.
I'm going down there.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.771
Sir, if I may, your place is
on the bridge.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.072
I'm going down there!

15:07.106 --> 15:09.074
Think they'd give me
three weeks off

15:09.108 --> 15:10.009
to sit on an egg?

15:20.319 --> 15:22.287
(electricity crackling)

15:30.295 --> 15:32.164
Chief, was anyone injured
in the rupture?

15:32.197 --> 15:34.133
A few minor injuries, but
the force field snapped on

15:34.166 --> 15:35.300
like it's supposed to.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.269
Gonna take a few days
to patch up, though.

15:37.302 --> 15:40.806
Look, whatever additional power,
resources you need, whatever,

15:40.840 --> 15:44.109
you've got it. I appreciate
that, kid, we'll be all right.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.613
(device beeping)

15:54.854 --> 15:56.989
Ensign Parker, what happened?
(grunts)

15:57.022 --> 15:58.490
Wrong place at the wrong time.

15:58.523 --> 15:59.791
Will he be okay?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.293
Well, he won't be
running any marathons

16:01.326 --> 16:04.496
for a couple of days,
but he'll be all right.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.668
Doctor, can I talk
to you in private?

16:09.701 --> 16:11.670
Sure.

16:17.809 --> 16:20.045
I can't do this.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.381
You mean command the Orville?
Yes.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.816
I wasn't in that chair
ten minutes, and I almost

16:24.850 --> 16:25.817
destroyed the entire ship.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.152
What if someone had been killed?

16:27.186 --> 16:28.954
But you didn't.
And they weren't.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.622
You're the ship's doctor.

16:30.655 --> 16:33.625
You're the only person who can
relieve an officer of command.

16:33.658 --> 16:35.160
Can't you just come up with
some reason that I'm unfit?

16:35.194 --> 16:37.162
Tell them I'm a drug addict,
anything.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.964
Just get someone
to replace me, please.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.532
No, I will not do that.

16:40.565 --> 16:43.502
But I will give you some advice.
Now, sit.

16:46.939 --> 16:50.409
Command is all about the balance
between inspiring confidence

16:50.442 --> 16:53.678
in your leadership and knowing
when to trust your people.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.415
You got scared out there today.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.918
Scared that they
didn't respect you.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.654
So you ignored Isaac's advice
in order to appear in control.

17:02.687 --> 17:05.424
Now, the question is, did you
learn from this error?

17:06.691 --> 17:09.461
I'm willing to bet that you did.

17:10.629 --> 17:12.231
Will you help me?

17:12.264 --> 17:15.234
I'm not gonna whisper
the right answers in your ear,

17:15.267 --> 17:18.537
but I'll try to be your Obi-Wan
however I can.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.605
My what?

17:20.639 --> 17:22.541
Never mind.

17:29.481 --> 17:32.417
♪

18:01.513 --> 18:03.448
What is this?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.449
It's...

18:05.951 --> 18:08.287
...our old apartment.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.622
In New York City.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.970
This is impossible.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.171
It's exactly like
I remember it.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.674
Look at this.

18:31.843 --> 18:33.312
This is the one from my office.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.981
I took it with me
when I moved out.

18:36.015 --> 18:39.784
We couldn't have been
sent back in time?

18:39.818 --> 18:41.987
I mean, that's...
that's crazy, right?

18:49.494 --> 18:51.130
(keypad beeping)

18:54.166 --> 18:56.168
The door's sealed.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.669
KELLY:
Here.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.971
(both straining)

19:00.005 --> 19:01.706
It's okay, I got it,
I got it.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.645
Oh! Oh!
Ed, are you okay?

19:06.678 --> 19:07.779
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Are you sure?

19:07.812 --> 19:09.948
I'm fine. I'm fine.
All good.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.350
(inhales)

19:13.852 --> 19:15.354
Kel, where the hell are we?

19:26.198 --> 19:28.133
Lieutenant, I believe
I have something.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.235
What is it?

19:30.269 --> 19:33.205
My analysis of our
scanner logs indicates

19:33.238 --> 19:35.474
there was a concentrated pulse
directed away from the buoy

19:35.507 --> 19:36.575
at the moment of the incident,

19:36.608 --> 19:38.210
traveling along
this trajectory.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.878
What do you think it was?

19:39.911 --> 19:41.480
I cannot be certain,

19:41.513 --> 19:45.184
but I believe it may have been
a form of molecular transfer.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.319
You think they may have been
transported somewhere?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.822
If so, there may still be
residual traces of the pulse.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.192
I will need to divert power
to the forward scanners

19:53.225 --> 19:54.859
to conduct a
long-range search.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.096
We're already
on emergency power.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.771
All hands, this is
Acting Captain Kitan.

20:06.805 --> 20:08.940
Emergency power will be
temporarily rerouted

20:08.973 --> 20:11.210
to the scanner array
until further notice.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.211
(over intercom):
Newton to bridge.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.512
Kid, you got to be joking.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.779
You reroute power,
and this ship's

20:14.813 --> 20:16.081
not gonna be goin' anywhere.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.716
Chief, unless we know where

20:17.749 --> 20:19.251
the captain and the commander
were taken,

20:19.284 --> 20:22.454
there'll be nowhere to go.
Oh, and it's

20:22.487 --> 20:23.955
"sir," not "kid."

20:23.988 --> 20:25.924
Just a friendly reminder.

20:25.957 --> 20:28.093
Aye, sir.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.429
Dora the Explorer
got some balls.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.764
Good ones.
Good balls.

20:32.797 --> 20:35.100
(grunts):
Crap!

20:37.169 --> 20:38.770
What about the window?

20:38.803 --> 20:40.405
I mean,
we're a hundred stories up.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.307
What are we supposed to do,
scale a wall?

20:42.341 --> 20:45.644
Yeah, good point.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.747
So, what do we do now?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.048
Survival.

20:50.081 --> 20:52.751
I mean, as long as we're
here, wherever here is,

20:52.784 --> 20:55.420
we better make sure that
the food synthesizer works.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.758
At least we won't starve.

20:59.791 --> 21:03.328
Look at this.
It's my favorite robe.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.964
I haven't seen this
in two years.

21:05.997 --> 21:07.832
By the way, this was
an inspired idea.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.802
Of course, if there's anything
in the food, we're screwed.

21:10.835 --> 21:12.671
Yeah, I kind of doubt
whoever brought us here

21:12.704 --> 21:15.140
went through all the trouble
just to poison us.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.608
(pulls cork from bottle)

21:18.009 --> 21:19.378
Mm-hmm.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.483
Thank you.
Mm.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.485
(fork scrapes plate)

21:28.520 --> 21:30.789
Ed...

21:30.822 --> 21:34.092
you think the Orville
knows we're alive?

21:34.125 --> 21:36.295
You think they're
even looking for us?

21:36.328 --> 21:38.497
Well,
we better hope so.

21:40.665 --> 21:43.001
I left Alara in command.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.303
Yeah.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.637
What do you think?

21:45.670 --> 21:47.972
Well, she's smart,

21:48.006 --> 21:49.341
but she's really green.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.343
I know.

21:52.977 --> 21:55.480
I'm gonna try to
get some sleep.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.782
Do you, uh, do you want
the bed or the couch?

21:57.816 --> 21:59.284
Hmm.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.785
You take the bed.
I've had so much to drink,

22:00.819 --> 22:02.454
I think I'd die
at that altitude.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.656
(chuckling):
Okay.

22:04.689 --> 22:05.990
And if we're still here
tomorrow,

22:06.024 --> 22:08.660
we can move on to that brownie.

22:10.094 --> 22:12.163
Hey, wait, do you...

22:12.197 --> 22:14.032
do you remember that time
that Jeff and Maureen

22:14.065 --> 22:15.467
invited us to the opera?

22:15.500 --> 22:18.670
(laughs)
Oh, my God, yes.

22:18.703 --> 22:20.405
And you knew I hated opera,
so you made me smoke that joint

22:20.439 --> 22:21.706
before we left.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.642
I'm so sorry, that was
supposed to be mine.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.810
I gave you the wrong one.
Your weapons-grade weed.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.079
Yes, I remember it very well.
(both laugh)

22:28.112 --> 22:30.014
And it kicked in when
we got to the theater,

22:30.048 --> 22:31.650
and I became convinced
that I was...

22:31.683 --> 22:33.352
That you were
gonna be paralyzed.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.986
That I would be paralyzed
if I stayed seated

22:35.019 --> 22:36.555
for longer than two minutes.
(laughs)

22:36.588 --> 22:38.223
Oh, my God.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.058
And remember, you bashed
the hell out of Maureen's head

22:40.091 --> 22:41.326
when you jumped out of your chair?
Oh...

22:41.360 --> 22:42.761
(laughs)

22:42.794 --> 22:44.028
God, the size
of the bruise

22:44.062 --> 22:45.830
on her face
was just epic.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.232
Was that when they stopped
hanging out with us?

22:47.266 --> 22:49.167
Oh, yeah, they were done with us.
Yeah.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.902
That-- well, you know,
they sucked. Who cares?

I have no idea
what that means, but yes.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.717
If they'll speak to us,
we have a chance of finding out

34:13.751 --> 34:15.119
what happened to our people.

34:15.153 --> 34:16.387
Everybody ready?

34:17.956 --> 34:19.423
Isaac, give us a makeover.

34:19.457 --> 34:21.725
Yes, sir.

Calivon system.

34:36.474 --> 34:38.776

34:38.809 --> 34:41.012
Nice and easy.

34:50.654 --> 34:52.957
Calivon patrol ship approaching.

34:54.758 --> 34:56.327

34:58.829 --> 35:02.666

the ordinary here.

Yes, sir.

35:30.728 --> 35:32.663
All right. Let's go.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.702
Oh, Claire, I have bad news.
What's wrong?

35:38.736 --> 35:40.638
You're the ranking officer,
which means you have command.

35:40.671 --> 35:42.873
Enjoy.

35:42.906 --> 35:45.509
Son of a bitch.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.589
(spoon clattering in bowl)

36:04.828 --> 36:06.830
(clattering continues)

36:06.864 --> 36:08.332
Hey.

36:08.366 --> 36:09.833
Do you want to not
do that, please?

36:09.867 --> 36:11.869
What?
We lived together long enough.

36:11.902 --> 36:14.072
You know I do not like
listening to people eat cereal.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.906
It's morning.
I'm eating breakfast.

36:15.939 --> 36:17.808
You know, you should try
eating in the morning

36:17.841 --> 36:18.809
instead of drinking.

36:18.842 --> 36:19.810
It's neat.

36:19.843 --> 36:21.812
I'm having a beer.

36:21.845 --> 36:23.214
Yeah, at 9:00 a.m.

36:23.247 --> 36:25.015
Which,
in case you don't remember,

36:25.049 --> 36:26.150
is something that I do not like.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.752
I'm doing something
that the Germans...

36:28.786 --> 36:30.154
"The Germans have been doing
for centuries," yes.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.222
You love that one,
don't you?

36:31.255 --> 36:32.523
Well, guess what.
You're not German.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.260
Well, you're not
Franken Berry, so shut up.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.196
You know what? It is all
coming back to me now.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.430
Oh, what, Kel?
What is, what is

36:39.463 --> 36:41.499
all coming back to you now?
Us.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.501
Living together. All the things
that sucked about it.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.369
Yes! This is exactly what
I was saying on the shuttle.

36:45.403 --> 36:46.604
Do you remember?
And you said no.

36:46.637 --> 36:48.038
I said,
"We were a bad match."

36:48.072 --> 36:50.174
Okay? I am just as miserable
with you as you are with me.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.775
Well, great,
finally some common ground.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.444
Some common ground between the two of us.
Some common ground.

36:53.477 --> 36:54.945
Thank God. ALARA: Captain.

36:54.978 --> 36:57.615
Alara?

36:57.648 --> 36:59.183
Alara, what are
you doing here?

36:59.217 --> 37:00.618
Getting you out.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.120
God, am I glad to see you.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.687
Sorry about my breath.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.289
Wait a minute, you...

37:05.323 --> 37:08.092
you couldn't have gotten
Union clearance to come here.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.794
No. We took a little field trip.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.796
Well, I wish we could tell you
how to get us out of here,

37:12.830 --> 37:14.798
but, honestly, we have no idea.
It would be reasonable

37:14.832 --> 37:17.301
to assume that if this is a zoo,

37:17.335 --> 37:19.803
there must be a zookeeper.

37:19.837 --> 37:21.239
(digital trilling)

37:21.272 --> 37:23.907
(door chimes)
Come in.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.980
Well, hello there.

37:30.013 --> 37:32.116
They told me we had a Kaylon
visitor here at the zoo.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.917
Welcome.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.154
Good day, sir. What brings
you all the way out here?

37:36.187 --> 37:39.257
Besides the fact that we have
the widest variety of species

37:39.290 --> 37:40.991
on exhibit
anywhere in the sector?

37:41.024 --> 37:43.594
There is a matter
I wish to discuss with you.

37:43.627 --> 37:45.329
If you're gonna try and
sell me that Xelayan female,

37:45.363 --> 37:46.797
I've already got one.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.166
She is not for sale.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.301
She is... my pet.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.602
Woof.

37:51.635 --> 37:53.103
ISAAC:
However, I would like to

37:53.137 --> 37:54.305
speak with you
about the humans.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.106
Oh, aren't they wonderful?

37:56.140 --> 37:57.308
They're brand-new.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.976
The visitors are loving them.

37:59.009 --> 38:01.512
I must inform you they are
the property of another zoo,

38:01.545 --> 38:03.147
and were taken illegally.

38:03.181 --> 38:05.349
Well, they should've been
kept on a tighter leash.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.750
Not my problem.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.619
I'm afraid they were
in the midst of treatment

38:08.652 --> 38:10.821
for a very rare disease
they are carrying,

38:10.854 --> 38:12.089
one that could infect

38:12.122 --> 38:14.292
your other species.
You're kidding.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.627
I am Kaylon.
We do not kid.

38:16.660 --> 38:19.197
We would be happy to
take them off your hands.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.464
Damn it.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.200
I don't believe this.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.467
This is the administrator.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.035
Initialize euthanasia sweep

38:25.068 --> 38:27.305
of unit 484.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.006

38:32.843 --> 38:35.045
Uh, Kel?

38:35.078 --> 38:36.714
What's going...?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.157
What... what the hell is that?

38:47.191 --> 38:49.026
I don't think we
want to find out.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.571
Oh, boy.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.039
We're in trouble.

39:02.072 --> 39:04.975
Wait, what do you mean
"euthanasia sweep"?

39:05.008 --> 39:07.378
Would it not be simpler to
allow us to take the humans?

39:07.411 --> 39:09.980
We have a strict non-contaminant
policy that's helped us

39:10.013 --> 39:11.982
avoid any epidemics
among the exhibits.

39:12.015 --> 39:14.485
I'm sorry, but even handing them
over to you would risk a breach.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.753
Don't worry,

39:15.786 --> 39:17.321
their deaths
will be painless.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.322
Uh...

39:18.356 --> 39:20.190
In here.

39:20.224 --> 39:21.325
Oh, my God.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.893
Oh, crap. Uh...
Oh, no.

39:22.926 --> 39:24.428
Isaac, I need
to talk to him.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.096
Make him talk to me.

39:26.129 --> 39:28.532
Sir, I would like you to listen

39:28.566 --> 39:30.868
to what my Xelayan
female has to say.

39:30.901 --> 39:32.102
(chuckles)

39:32.135 --> 39:34.938
You want me to talk...

39:34.972 --> 39:36.106
to her?

39:36.139 --> 39:37.541
Is this a joke?

39:37.575 --> 39:38.609
All right,
just stay calm.

39:38.642 --> 39:39.943
Oh!

39:39.977 --> 39:41.111
I know it is absurd,

39:41.144 --> 39:43.281
but if you will
indulge me momentarily,

39:43.314 --> 39:46.116
I would be
most appreciative.

39:46.149 --> 39:48.085
Okay.

39:48.118 --> 39:49.287
Talk, Xelayan.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.588
Thanks, dick.

39:50.621 --> 39:51.789
Okay.

39:51.822 --> 39:53.724
Why do you run this zoo?

39:53.757 --> 39:55.559
So our people may view
different species

39:55.593 --> 39:57.127
in their natural habitats.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.129
What if I were to trade you

39:59.162 --> 40:00.398
something that would be

40:00.431 --> 40:02.099
far more
valuable to you?

40:02.132 --> 40:05.102
Something irresistible?

40:05.135 --> 40:07.438
And what might that be?

40:07.471 --> 40:08.939
Uh...
Oh, God.

40:08.972 --> 40:10.908
No, no, no.
Uh, uh...
