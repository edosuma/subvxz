WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.339
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.373 --> 00:08.007
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.812
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:11.845 --> 00:13.481
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.514 --> 00:17.151
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.853
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.490
You are a good commander.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.025
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.827
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.496
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.499
That is the mission.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.834
You were in detention.
 For good reason.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.669
I was just wondering
 what to do about it now.

00:35.703 --> 00:36.770
That's not up to you.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.341
Take cover!

00:40.374 --> 00:42.676
WRAY: Homeworld Command needs
 the intel they're providing,

00:42.710 --> 00:44.912
and it's quite possible
 that these prisoners
 have information

00:44.945 --> 00:46.747
that could help
 head off that attack.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.682
ELI: Ginn and I figured out

00:48.716 --> 00:52.019
how to dial the ninth chevron
 back to Earth while
 Destiny recharges in a star.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.021
RUSH: Somehow,
 I've come back
 through time.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.756
Tell them not to try
 and dial Earth.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.525
It won't work.
 They're all going to die.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.360
Stop trying to scare people
 and get on with this.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.028
Wait three seconds,
then follow me!

01:01.061 --> 01:02.430
RUSH: The connection was made,

01:02.463 --> 01:04.765
but you were the only one
 who made it through to Earth.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.542
Welcome back, David.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.076
Everett.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.745
What the hell happened?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.413
That's gonna take
some explaining.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.049
To the best
 of our knowledge,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.784
the connection
 was only viable
 for a few moments,

01:23.817 --> 01:26.053
which is why
 you were the only one
 who made it through.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.889
So where'd everyone else go?

01:28.922 --> 01:32.726
The likely answer is
 they were simply killed
 in an unstable wormhole.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.562
The other me?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.630
He died

01:36.664 --> 01:40.100
trying to retrieve
 some valuable hardware
 from the other Destiny.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.669
It was an accident.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.439
David?

01:47.608 --> 01:48.976
It's a lot to process.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.645
No. No, I get it.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.916
Sort of. (EXHALES)

01:55.949 --> 01:57.251
Anyway, I've been
 around the program

01:57.285 --> 01:59.920
long enough to know
this stuff happens,

01:59.953 --> 02:03.157
but good luck trying
 to explain it
 to Senator Michaels.

02:03.191 --> 02:06.594
New head of the off-world
 spending committee?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.262
TELFORD: I've gotta
 head back, but she's
 coming onboard.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.764
She'll want a post-mortem
 on this latest fiasco,

02:10.798 --> 02:13.601
but what she's really
 interested in is Rush's
 little signal from God...

02:13.634 --> 02:15.936
I never called it that.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.106
TELFORD: Well,
 that's what a lot of them
 are calling it back home.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
It's created
 a bit of a stir.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.947
They wanna know
 if it's worth
 spending the money

02:26.980 --> 02:29.617
to get another
Icarus base
up and running.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.118
Yeah, even if they do,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.487
and they find another planet
 and make a connection,

02:33.521 --> 02:35.623
it's still only
 a one-way trip.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.826
You, me,
 and everyone on this ship
 aren't going anywhere.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.961
Yeah, it'd be nice
 to get supplies.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.631
I should switch
 with the Senator,
 talk to my people,

02:43.664 --> 02:47.000
find out how this is
 all playing with our
 international partners.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.168
All right.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.170
We'll need a male
volunteer as well.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.507
She's bringing a scientist
with her
to confirm Rush's findings.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.509
Oh, well, in that case,
 I know the perfect candidate.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.177
Camile.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.713
He's the only one
onboard who hasn't used
the stones to go back.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.816
He keeps
 turning it down.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.185
Well, then maybe
 you should
 order him to go.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.021
He was
 borderline unstable
 when we came onboard.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.823
If anyone can use
 some time off...

03:09.857 --> 03:11.925
All right,
 I will make that happen.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.998
This was your idea,
wasn't it?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.534
We don't have
 all day, Sergeant.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.904
I don't need R&R.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.840
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
 You're the perfect soldier.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.042
No rest,
 no weakness,
 no fear.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.746
Now, can we get
 this over with?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.090
SERGEANT:
 Identify yourself.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.192
What's going on?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.894
Identify yourself now!

03:46.927 --> 03:49.196
I'm Camile Wray,
 this is Master Sergeant
 Ronald Greer.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.598
Authentication code.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.100
1-7-0-0-5-8-6.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.272
What is going on?
 This is a scheduled
 connection.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.708
TELFORD:
 At ease, Sergeant.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.610
Sorry about
 this, Camile.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.111
Senator Michaels
 and Dr. Covel
 were briefed,

04:04.144 --> 04:05.746
but there was
 no time to warn you.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.248
We are at a heightened
terrorist threat level.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.885
What happened?

04:11.919 --> 04:12.953
Nothing yet,

04:12.986 --> 04:14.888
but intel says that
the Lucian Alliance

04:14.922 --> 04:16.890
is on the verge of
 launching an attack.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.091
Homeworld Command
 is the target.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.411
Does anyone know
 this guy that they're
 sending to check up on us?

04:37.445 --> 04:40.013
Supposedly, he's the
 new head of research
 at Stargate Command.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.251
Hovel or Shovel,
 something like that.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.253
RUSH: It's Covel.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.255
Dr. Andrew Covel.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
We worked together
 for a short time
 at Cornell

04:50.123 --> 04:52.259
before we were
 both recruited
 into the program.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.794
YOUNG: Rush, come in.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.796
Yeah, go ahead.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.698
Our guests have arrived.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.302
Yeah, I'm on my way.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.679
So, what's he like?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.616
I didn't know him
 that well, actually.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.785
But you said you
 worked with him.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.654
Yeah, well,
 what can I tell you?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.357
He's the type of man
 who likes to keep secrets.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.695
Yeah, we know the type.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.332
Incredible.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.702
The design predates
 any Ancient technology
 we've seen

05:34.735 --> 05:35.703
in the Milky Way
 or Pegasus.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.137
Well, it's a pretty
big ship.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.172
Anywhere in particular
 you'd like to start?

05:39.206 --> 05:42.342
I'd like to start by
 clearing something up.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.813
Given recent events,
 I would like to know
 once and for all

05:45.846 --> 05:49.316
if we're closing
 the book on the feasibility
 of dialing within a star.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.152
YOUNG: I'm not the man
 you should be asking.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.987
MICHAELS:
 Your first order
 of business

05:54.021 --> 05:55.989
was supposed to be
 to get these people home.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.225
YOUNG: Presumably
 without killing them.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.394
If I'm not mistaken,
 all of our people
 signed off on it.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.996
Numbers were good,
 but it's true,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.198
conditions inside a star
 are unpredictable.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.868
It's just unfortunate that
 the other Destiny was lost

06:07.901 --> 06:10.337
before anyone had a chance
 to go over the logs.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.240
We needed those spare parts.
 There wasn't a lot of time.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.509
MICHAELS:
 That's understandable.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.345
Unfortunately,
 it means we have no idea
 what really happened.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.914
YOUNG: You're assuming
 the other Rush was lying.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.918
My impressions of the man,
 Colonel, are based entirely
 on your reports.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.854
We've had
 our differences,

06:26.887 --> 06:29.022
but this time I was prepared
 to support him, stay behind,

06:29.056 --> 06:31.525
as long as we had
 enough volunteers
 to keep the mission going.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.193
RUSH: Sorry I'm late.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.195
Problems with power
 distribution, as usual.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.398
Dr. Rush, Senator Michaels.
 I believe you know Dr. Covel.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.200
Andrew.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.401
Nicholas,
good to see you.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.437
So, what are we
 talking about?

06:45.906 --> 06:49.076
I was just telling
 Colonel Young how
 I would like to see Chloe.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.944
I was very good friends
with her father,

06:50.978 --> 06:53.881
and I've know her since
she was a little girl.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.283
Sure. She's on the bridge.
 I'll take you to her.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.428
Is that what
 I think it is?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.898
We're sweeping
 the building
 for radiation.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.900
The Alliance has
 managed to infiltrate

07:12.933 --> 07:15.168
a couple of our
 off-world bases
 and plant naquadria bombs.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.772
All clear, sir.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.907
Thank you. Carry on.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.109
Yes, sir.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.077
We have escorts waiting
 for both of you outside.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.445
They'll take you
 wherever you need to go.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.915
All due respect, sir,
 with everything going on,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.984
I think I'd like
to stay right here.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.086
Appreciate the thought,
 Master Sergeant,
 but we've got this.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.455
Look, I know
 these people, Colonel.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.257
I've dealt with them.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.929
Unlike some of us,
 I never trusted them.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.097
I'll keep that
 under advisement,

07:44.131 --> 07:44.965
but for now,
 you're dismissed.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.835
Yes, sir.

08:04.051 --> 08:04.985
Nice.

08:11.992 --> 08:12.993
Chloe?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.132
Senator Michaels,
 is it you?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.468
Yes.
Oh, my God.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
(LAUGHS)
Hi, sweetheart.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.306
Look at you.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.142
CHLOE: Wow,
 welcome to the Destiny.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.378
MICHAELS:
 I can't believe it.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.046
Well, what are
 you doing?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.984
Oh, I was just going over
 the ship's FTL jump logs.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.318
We're trying to
 improve the accuracy
 of manual navigation.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.320
Really?

08:40.352 --> 08:41.488
It's the new me.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.557
What do you think?

08:43.591 --> 08:47.561
Well,
 I think I'd like to leave
 the science and technology

08:47.595 --> 08:50.330
to somebody else
 for a few moments
 so we can talk,

08:50.363 --> 08:51.999
if that's okay
 with you?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.867
Go ahead, Chloe.
 You can finish this later.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.337
Great, come on.
 I'll show you around.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.907
All right.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.044
Well, I have to say,
 Nicholas, I'm impressed.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.413
I think I'm starting
 to understand the passion
 you had for this mission

09:06.446 --> 09:08.882
even before
 you found a signal.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.551
Congratulations.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.555
Yeah.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.529
Master Sergeant, wait!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.564
I'm off duty, right?
Yes.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.233
Then I don't have
to talk to you.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.268
You know, if you go into this
 assuming it's a waste of time,

09:28.301 --> 09:29.236
it probably will be.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.541
Do you have any idea
 what's going on here?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.277
We've known about
the Lucian Alliance
threat for a long time.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.380
And too bad we didn't
 do anything about it.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.949
I did do
something about it.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.885
Those prisoners gave us
valuable intelligence.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
Maybe they were just
 feeding us a line

09:46.954 --> 09:51.291
while we gave them food
 and shelter and put
 our own people at risk!

09:51.324 --> 09:53.426
You don't know what...
(ALARM BLARING)

09:53.460 --> 09:55.062
What's happening?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.229
That's incoming.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.297
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

09:57.330 --> 09:58.598
No, no...
What are you doing?

09:58.632 --> 10:00.634
We have to go...
 Let go of me! Where?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.936
No, we've got
to get out of here!

10:11.178 --> 10:13.413
MICHAELS:
 I don't know
 how you do it.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.417
I would have gone crazy
in two weeks locked up
in a place like this,

10:17.450 --> 10:18.752
let alone a whole year.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.620
It's not like
 we never get outside.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.623
We gate to planets
 all the time.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.025
I spoke to your
 mom the other day.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.429
How's she doing?

10:29.462 --> 10:33.633
She's holding up,
 you know, it's not easy,
 but she's holding up.

10:36.536 --> 10:39.139
I'm so sorry, Chloe.
 We should've gotten
 you home long ago.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.975
It's not just me.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.644
Look,

10:47.647 --> 10:51.985
everyone else on this ship,
 with the exception
 of Mr. Wallace,

10:52.019 --> 10:54.321
is a member of

10:54.354 --> 10:56.523
Yeah, that doesn't mean
 they signed up for this.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.026
Maybe not,

10:59.059 --> 11:01.294
but it does mean that,
 sooner or later,

11:01.328 --> 11:03.797
they were gonna wind up
 on some obscure planet,

11:03.831 --> 11:06.466

 what kind of research,

11:06.499 --> 11:09.669

 get me wrong,

 of all of that,

 that that life was for you.

 had such plans.

 such a waste.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.337
Yeah, I think so.

 it all back to Earth

 maybe I could confirm it.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.369
I can't do that.
 I mean, with the stones,
 it's basically word of mouth.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.437
I have to make
 a judgment call here.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.406
Do you have any idea
 what kind of a position
 that puts me in?

 offered Icarus before

 it down. You couldn't
 see the potential.

 they get here...

are we talking about?

 it's a weapons-grade

All right, well,
 if you can't get in,
 and we can't get out,

20:20.387 --> 20:25.224
then maybe the best plan is
 for us to go for the bomb.

No, no, that's not it.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.325
So now
 you're gonna tell me
 something about me?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.359
I know you.

22:40.393 --> 22:41.394
You know a file in a desk!

22:44.030 --> 22:45.164
You don't know anything.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.033
You're afraid of me!

22:47.066 --> 22:49.001
Do you hear
 something?

22:49.035 --> 22:52.004
You're afraid of what I do
 because I help people
 with their problems,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.841
but I can't do it unless
 they admit that they have
 problems in the first place,

22:54.874 --> 22:56.342
and that's just
somewhere you won't go!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.878
You need to just think
 you make a difference,

22:58.911 --> 23:00.713
instead of just
taking up space...

23:00.747 --> 23:02.415
Shut up for a minute.

23:02.449 --> 23:06.018
You're afraid that if you
 look inside yourself
 for even one second,

23:06.052 --> 23:07.854
you might find out
 that you're not invincible,

23:07.887 --> 23:09.422
that you're just as scared
 and vulnerable as
 the rest of us...

23:09.456 --> 23:11.023
I said shut up!

23:11.057 --> 23:12.358
(GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING)

23:12.391 --> 23:13.893
I can hear something.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.396
It's coming
 from over here.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.866
What is it?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.734
It's the Geiger counter.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.402
The tech who was
 sweeping the building.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.376
There he is.
 Hey! Can you hear us?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.243
We're gonna get you out.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.113
Oh, God!

(GRUNTS)

23:52.765 --> 23:54.901
That doesn't
 sound good.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.103
I don't know.
 I can't read this thing.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.771
Here, give it to me.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.273
(COUGHING)

24:10.316 --> 24:13.419
This area is flooded
 with radiation.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.988
It could be from
 the crashed ship,
 or from the bomb itself,

24:16.022 --> 24:18.257
but these are
 deadly levels.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.328
What you're saying
 is if we stay here
 much longer, we could die.

24:22.361 --> 24:25.965
No. I'm saying
 we're dead already.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.869
So, what's the verdict?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.940
Well, I've hardly
 completed my assessment,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.475
but I do have
 some concerns.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.345
Such as?

24:39.378 --> 24:42.815
Well, you know how long
it took to get the first
Icarus base up and running.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.284
Even if I were
to get presidential
approval tomorrow,

24:45.317 --> 24:48.020
and we were to find
 a planet immediately,

24:48.054 --> 24:49.989
it'd still take
 another six months

24:50.022 --> 24:51.357
before we're ready
 to do a dial-out.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.326
And?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.128
To be perfectly blunt,

24:56.162 --> 24:58.297
we're not sure
 you're gonna
 survive that long.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.133
And more importantly,
 we're not sure Destiny's
 gonna survive.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.369
Well, we've managed
 to hold it together so far.

25:03.402 --> 25:06.172
What, are you kidding me?
 You're the problem here.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.473
Since you and your
 people came onboard,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.542
you've brought this
ship to the brink of
destruction repeatedly.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.477
It's a wonder
 this thing's
 flying at all.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.546
Colonel, this is Brody.
 We're about to drop out
 of FTL.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.650
That's understood.
 Heads up.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.852
The connection's going to be
 interrupted for a few seconds.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.191
These bodies.
 We did this to them.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.863
There was no way to know.
 It was the right call.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.166
If we leave now,
 get out as fast as we can,
 we might still be okay.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.168
I'm sorry, Airman,
 I really am,

25:36.202 --> 25:38.037
but we've already
had lethal exposure.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.407
You can't know that!
You're not a scientist!

25:41.440 --> 25:44.210
Maybe not, but I've worked
 with enough of them
 to pick up a few things.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.021
What the hell's
 going on?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.223
What is this?
 What's happening?

25:57.256 --> 25:59.291
Let me see that.
 In your hand.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.197
Colonel.
 We just dropped out.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.366
There's been an attack.
Lucian Alliance.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.869
There's a bomb,
 naquadria,
 radiation leaking.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.903
We're trying
 to get to it, but...

26:13.239 --> 26:15.207
Senator?

26:15.241 --> 26:18.077
Oh, my God.
 Homeworld Command.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.280
What happened?

26:21.313 --> 26:23.382
The connection
 was interrupted.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.551
You think they got the gist
 of what I was trying to say?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.054
If he didn't,
 the other two
 can fill them in.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.555
They've seen it
 for themselves now.

(EXCLAIMS)

26:32.591 --> 26:34.961
Evans, what the hell?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.996
Put the gun down.
 Put it down now
 or I'll kill her!

26:40.132 --> 26:42.434
Are we sure
 this is a good idea?

26:42.468 --> 26:44.603
I mean, your people are
already on the ground.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.572
They know the situation.
 We could just make
 things worse.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.274
We won't wipe the stones.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.576
We'll just
 disconnect long enough
 to get a full report.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.245
Then we will bring you back
 and let you know
 what's happening.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.446
Go ahead.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.254
Nothing happened.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.289
Shut the device off.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.461
We're still here.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.633
Airman, what the hell
 are you doing?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.669
I'm not gonna die in here!

27:16.703 --> 27:18.671
We're gonna turn around
 and find another way out!

27:19.538 --> 27:21.640
You're freaking out.

27:21.674 --> 27:25.177
I understand,
 but this isn't gonna help.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.681
Shoot him. Even if
 he kills me, you can
 still get to the bomb.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.349
Camile.
 It's an act!

27:30.382 --> 27:31.650
If you give him the gun,
 he'll kill us both.

27:33.519 --> 27:34.486
He's Lucian Alliance.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.156
(GRUNTS)

27:51.503 --> 27:53.172
You're sure
 he was one of them?

27:53.205 --> 27:56.342
There was something wrong
 about him from the start,

27:56.375 --> 27:58.677
and he knew
 I wasn't a scientist,
 but I never told him that.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.680
All he knew was my name.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.418
Telford gave them
 files on all of us.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.824
Clan tattoo.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.525
He was probably the pilot.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.227
Think there's any more
 like him around here?

28:16.195 --> 28:18.397
No, I doubt it.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.701
I mean, my guess is
 that the plan was to
 land the ship cloaked

28:22.735 --> 28:25.537
on the roof
 or somewhere nearby,
 and then just walk away.

28:27.606 --> 28:28.540
Nice catch.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.686
The radiation's spiking.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.720
I think we're
getting close.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.225
Can we make it through?

28:49.728 --> 28:53.632
Yeah, I think we can
 make it through here.
 We'll have to crawl, though.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.634
Sorry.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.738
No, don't worry about me.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.575
Right.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.880
YOUNG: Well?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.615
It's interesting.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.551
This shouldn't be
 happening.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.220
What do you mean?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.222
The stones work in pairs,
 they're linked.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.224
In order for a connection
 to be shut off,

29:18.257 --> 29:19.758
the command has to be
 received at both ends.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.760
We've seen radiation cut
 the signal off before.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.096
Yes, but in this case,
 the transfer's still in place,

29:24.130 --> 29:25.731
which means the signal
 must be getting through.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.399
The radiation must
 only be affecting

29:27.433 --> 29:29.268
command protocols,
 nothing else.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.071
There may be a way
 to boost that specific
 portion of the signal,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.640
or alter it in order
 to get it past
 the interference.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.242
I've done a fair
amount of research

29:36.275 --> 29:37.643
in this technology.
 I can help.

29:37.676 --> 29:39.111
Colonel.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.280
Varro would like
 to speak with you.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.251
Tamara told me
 what happened.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.653
I realize
 I'm probably the last person
 you wanna talk to right now,

29:47.686 --> 29:49.255
but I think I can help.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.589
How?

29:50.622 --> 29:53.492
I can tell you how
 to defuse that bomb.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.099
I see the hull of the ship.
We're almost there.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.826
Is that it?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.463
(GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING FAST)

30:31.497 --> 30:34.166
Yeah. It's the source
 of the radiation.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.673
David, this is Camile.
 I think we found our bomb.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.577
David, come in?

30:53.019 --> 30:55.687
This is Camile Wray.
 Is anybody reading this?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.492
Too much interference.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.329
So much for plan A.

31:03.362 --> 31:08.334
We're gonna have to
 do this on our own.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.170
The Alliance uses
 a pretty simple design
 for its naquadria bombs.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.539
The tricky part is,
 it'll be protected
 by a hologram shell,

31:13.572 --> 31:16.742
so whoever disarms it
 will have to do so by feel.

31:16.775 --> 31:20.346
The trigger wire is
 a slightly thinner gauge,
 probably threaded.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.713
It's the only way
 to distinguish it.

31:21.747 --> 31:23.515
How do we know any of
 what you're saying is true?

31:23.549 --> 31:25.351
I've worked with
 these devices before.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.585
That's not what I meant.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.423
I didn't know about
 the attack, Colonel.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.858
If I did, I would
 have warned you.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.526
Sir, I think
 he's telling the truth.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.894
Oh, I know you do.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.369
Well, it won't matter
anyway if Rush can't get
those stones to disconnect.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.704
Maybe not.
 If it really is this simple,

31:45.737 --> 31:47.606
maybe it's something
 that can be explained quickly,

31:47.639 --> 31:49.375
like, say,
in a few seconds?

31:49.408 --> 31:50.409
An FTL jump.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.745
We deliberately
 interrupt the connection.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.547
We can't do that.
 We just dropped out.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.549
We jump this soon,
 we're gonna damage
 the engines.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.485
Catastrophic, or is it
 something we can live with?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.922
Something we can
 live with, I think,

32:03.956 --> 32:05.424
but it would be
 a one-shot deal.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.393
Once we're back in FTL,
 if we force an early drop,

32:07.426 --> 32:09.428
we're gonna blow
the engines completely.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.730
We're talking about 10,
 maybe 12 seconds at the most.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.233
What do you think,
 enough time?

32:14.266 --> 32:16.335
Yeah, I think I can
 get the message across.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.609
WRAY: It must be
 on a timer.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.645
The pilot probably wanted
 to give himself a chance
 to get to a safe distance.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.581
How long?

32:29.615 --> 32:33.585
No way to know for sure,
 but it's been
 a while since the crash.

32:33.619 --> 32:34.586
So it could go off
 any second.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.787
Yeah.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.423
It's possible
 that it was damaged,

32:37.456 --> 32:39.091
and it's not
 gonna go off at all.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.959
Or it could go off
 any second.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.797
I'm gonna try something.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.641
I think it's some
 kind of hologram.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.824
The bomb's underneath.
 I can feel it.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.630
We're gonna have
 to do this blind.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.965
(SCOFFS)

33:19.998 --> 33:22.034
Do what, exactly?

33:22.068 --> 33:24.670
I haven't quite
 figured that part out yet.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.842
CHLOE: Senator,
 there you are.

33:33.079 --> 33:36.014
We need you.
 We're going to try
 and force an FTL jump.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.051
Yes, I know,
 based on the word of
 some Alliance soldier.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.820
Look, I'm not sure
 we have a lot of choice.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.355
I shouldn't
 even be here.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.990
You know, I had people
 on my own committee

33:45.023 --> 33:46.125
telling me this
 was a waste of time,

33:46.158 --> 33:49.328
that our only priority
 should be the Alliance threat,

33:49.361 --> 33:50.662
and I didn't
listen to them.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.999
Look, I know you're worried
 about people back home.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.069
I am too, but you're
 wrong about Destiny.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.173
You know, the other Rush
 said that in his timeline

34:01.207 --> 34:03.842
I was one of the people
 who volunteered to stay.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.712
And you really think
 you would have done that?

34:08.714 --> 34:12.751
My father died
 so that we could
 all go on.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.053
I have to believe
 that it was for a reason.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.755
I feel like I'm part
 of something here.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.391
Something important.

34:23.594 --> 34:26.697
Okay, there's a large
 cylindrical piece,

34:26.732 --> 34:29.768
and some kind of
 gasket on the end.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.071
(SIGHING) Oh.

34:33.105 --> 34:36.542
And there's
 a lot of wires.
 I don't know!

34:36.574 --> 34:39.645
I mean, I could start pulling
 at things randomly, but...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.550
Listen.
Outer shell is holographic.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.885
Inside crown is panel,
 remove with pin.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.121
The trigger wire
 is slightly thinner,
 threaded, coarse.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.456
Don't pull the wire,
 it will detonate.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.958
Pop the linchpin
 by applying pressure
 to the base, and...

34:56.094 --> 34:58.764
A pin. A pin,
 we need a pin.

35:00.098 --> 35:00.966
I got one.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.737
What happened?
 Did they understand it?

35:05.771 --> 35:08.073
I don't know.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.108
Colonel Young, this is Rush
 in the communications lab.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.577
There's something
 you need to see.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.778
I'm on my way.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.983
I got it.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.152
Now, the trigger wire
 is threaded.
 Find it, but don't pull.

35:20.186 --> 35:21.687
Yeah, I know,
 it will blow up.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.623
Okay. Okay, now what?

35:25.624 --> 35:26.458
You didn't hear?

35:28.494 --> 35:32.631
No, I missed the last part.
 I was hoping that you...

35:40.038 --> 35:41.673
Oh, God.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.975
So, what are
 we looking at?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.946
Well, this is the
 enhanced command signal.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.950
It's now embedded
 within the frequencies
 of the mind transfer itself.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.486
Wait, are you saying
 you can shut down
 the connection?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.055
Oh, yeah. And I would
 have done a lot earlier

36:00.158 --> 36:03.295
if Dr. Covel hadn't been
 sabotaging our efforts.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.530
What?

36:04.563 --> 36:05.797
He altered one of
 the key algorithms.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.832
I checked.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.672
Okay, I did it.

36:15.073 --> 36:19.010
You have to understand
that when we went back,

36:19.044 --> 36:21.179
and I saw that
 Geiger counter?

36:21.213 --> 36:24.182
The radiation levels,
they're not survivable.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.885
What are you saying?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.988
Our bodies,
 they're as good as dead,

36:30.021 --> 36:35.160
and I just panicked,
 and I needed
 some time to think.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.029
You know what happens
 when someone dies at
 the end of a connection.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.732
No, no, no, because Dr. Perry
 was in a weakened condition.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.702
It is possible
 that a healthy person
 could have survived.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.671
So, wait a minute,
 what did you do?

36:45.704 --> 36:47.839
You decided to help
 yourself to this new body?
 Is that what you did?

36:47.873 --> 36:49.508
Why do they get
 to live and we don't?

36:49.541 --> 36:52.578
They put us
 in this position!

36:52.611 --> 36:54.513
It was easy for them
 to take a risk,

36:54.546 --> 36:56.748
because they weren't going
 to have to suffer
 the consequences!

36:59.217 --> 37:00.218
Colonel...

37:02.087 --> 37:06.057
Colonel Young,
 could you get
 Varro down here?

37:06.091 --> 37:09.561
He can go over
 the instructions again,
 and you can send us back.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.729
I'm not going.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.099
You don't have a choice.

37:14.132 --> 37:17.936
We should try again.
 Okay, we know which
 wire is the trigger.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.738
He said not to pull it.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.540
So we find another
 way to release it.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.775
Yeah, and if we're wrong,
 this bomb blows up!

37:23.809 --> 37:26.111
It's gonna blow up
 anyway, right?

37:26.144 --> 37:27.546
So what do we have to lose?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.947
But what about
 all the people
 out there,

37:28.980 --> 37:30.882
the people that
 we have to assume

37:30.916 --> 37:32.918
are being evacuated
from this area?

37:32.951 --> 37:35.721
Every second gives
 more of them a chance

37:35.754 --> 37:41.126
to get as far away
 from here as possible.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.663
You're right.

37:49.267 --> 37:54.840
So we just wait
 for it to happen.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.633
You know,

38:21.667 --> 38:27.105
I'm sorry we never
 got along better, Ronald.

38:27.138 --> 38:31.009
It's just we see
things differently.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.279
I mean, you like
 to take action,

38:34.312 --> 38:37.783
and I like to talk
 things through.

38:37.816 --> 38:43.121
Well, we're here now,
 and we're not going anywhere,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.023
so let's talk.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.668
I can't think of
 anything else to say.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.007
(LAUGHING)

39:08.179 --> 39:09.381
I'm sorry...

39:15.186 --> 39:16.688
Remember,
 don't pull the wire.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.324
Oh, I've got it.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.759
You're sure?
 You're ready for this?

39:31.202 --> 39:34.172
Just one more
thing, Colonel.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.074
Could you tell Chloe
 that I'm proud of her?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.376
Of course.

40:28.927 --> 40:29.995
Have you heard anything?

40:31.930 --> 40:32.964
Not yet.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.001
We've been
 back for hours.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.905
I know.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.808
We're gonna keep someone
 on the stones 24/7 until
 we get a connection.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.842
If we get
 a connection.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.285
I heard you have
 a friend who lives in DC.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.123
Sharon.

40:58.156 --> 41:01.827
She's more than
a friend, actually.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.999
I wish I could talk to her
 one more time, you know?

41:08.033 --> 41:10.435
Tell her how much
 she means to me.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.503
Yeah.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.307
I've been thinking
 about my mom.

41:19.978 --> 41:23.815
You know,
 things haven't really been
 that good between us.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.888
She never really wanted me
 to join the military.

41:35.994 --> 41:39.798
Last time I saw her,
 I didn't really say

41:39.831 --> 41:41.332
everything that
 I wanted to say.

41:46.371 --> 41:50.241
She's your mother, Ron.
She knows.

41:55.046 --> 41:58.383
Anyway, I'm sure this
 will all get resolved,

41:58.416 --> 42:02.854
and you can go and tell
 her yourself soon enough.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.190
Right.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.860
Soon enough.

43:28.173 --> 43:28.940
