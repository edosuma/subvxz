07:47.333 --> 07:48.917
Nice talking to you.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.667
Hi.

07:50.709 --> 07:53.083
(  somber theme playing  )

07:53.125 --> 07:55.375
( sighs )

07:53.125 --> 07:55.375
We hid for that?

07:55.417 --> 07:56.917
BLADES: So close.

07:55.417 --> 07:56.917
CHASE: Not really.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.125
I'm guessing you don't think

07:56.959 --> 07:59.125
that went well.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.291
Uh, no doy.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.291
I mean, I'm, I'm just...

08:02.333 --> 08:04.166
I am stumped here, bro.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.125
This is pretty basic stuff,

08:04.208 --> 08:07.125
and you're making me look bad.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.500
If I may suggest

08:08.834 --> 08:11.500
a new strategy?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.542
Chocolate-covered sugar pellets

08:11.542 --> 08:13.542
and colorful flora

08:13.583 --> 08:16.208
appear to be standard protocol

08:13.583 --> 08:16.208
in male-female interaction.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.583
Maybe you just need to practice

08:19.125 --> 08:21.583
talking to girls.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.500
Try it with me.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.500
Pretend I'm Amy.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.125
Uh...

08:26.166 --> 08:28.083
BLADES ( mimicking Amy ):

08:26.166 --> 08:28.083
Flowers, please!

08:28.125 --> 08:32.041
I don't have nearly enough

08:28.125 --> 08:32.041
imagination for this, Blades.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.500
I like you

08:32.083 --> 08:34.500
just the way you are.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.208
Thanks, but "the way I am"

08:37.250 --> 08:39.458
isn't confident enough

08:37.250 --> 08:39.458
to talk to Amy.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.166
Well, being Kade

08:39.500 --> 08:41.166
won't help either.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.458
You need to play

08:41.208 --> 08:43.458
to your strengths.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.125
HEATWAVE:

08:43.500 --> 08:46.125
You're good at science. Let that

08:43.500 --> 08:46.125
do your talking for you.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.625
(  hopeful theme playing  )

08:47.667 --> 08:50.583
( snoring, mumbling )

08:53.166 --> 08:55.750
Thank you, deputy,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.750
for your kindness.

08:55.792 --> 08:59.333
And cluelessness.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.667
Now, my little ones.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.333
Since you have no queen

09:01.709 --> 09:04.333
to command you,

09:04.375 --> 09:06.291
I shall.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.750
( echoing ):

09:06.333 --> 09:08.750
Halt!

09:08.792 --> 09:11.542
( echoing ):

09:08.792 --> 09:11.542
Now arise.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.917
( echoing ):

09:15.750 --> 09:18.917
Go to Doctor Greene's

09:15.750 --> 09:18.917
Laboratory.

09:18.959 --> 09:22.041
Burns' Family is about to learn

09:18.959 --> 09:22.041
what it really means

09:22.083 --> 09:25.792
to have your own technology

09:22.083 --> 09:25.792
used against you.

09:25.834 --> 09:29.166
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:29.208 --> 09:30.166
( chuckling evilly )

09:30.208 --> 09:32.500
Hmm.

09:34.542 --> 09:37.500
FRANKIE:

09:34.542 --> 09:37.500
Hey, Dad? Have you seen

09:34.542 --> 09:37.500
my chemistry notebook?

09:37.542 --> 09:39.083
I think I left it in the--

09:39.125 --> 09:40.333
( screams )

09:40.375 --> 09:42.500
What's wrong,

09:40.375 --> 09:42.500
Frankie?

09:42.542 --> 09:45.709
Ugh, I don't like being near

09:42.542 --> 09:45.709
any of Doctor Morocco's stuff,

09:45.750 --> 09:47.959
especially the MorBot.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.834
( shudders ):

09:48.000 --> 09:49.834
Bad memories, Dad.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.750
Sorry, Frankie.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.750
After studying its circuitry,

09:52.792 --> 09:55.500
I wanted to get

09:52.792 --> 09:55.500
a closer look at its power pod.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.291
Now, if I could find

09:57.333 --> 10:00.625
the power pod.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.625
It seems to have disappeared.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.083
Aw, Daddy, you have ants.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.083
And no wonder,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.583
they love it when you

10:04.125 --> 10:06.583
leave food lying around.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.542
( chuckles ):

10:06.625 --> 10:09.542
Quite right, my little Goodall.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.417
Ants do have

10:09.583 --> 10:12.417
an exceptional sense of smell.

10:12.458 --> 10:17.291
From now on, I resolve to keep

10:12.458 --> 10:17.291
a sparkling clean lab.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.834
Ha, ha. Let's get you

10:17.333 --> 10:19.834
cleaned up first.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.583
Before the ants

10:19.875 --> 10:21.583
think you're food.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.333
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:35.458 --> 10:37.208
( powering up )

10:39.875 --> 10:41.834
GRAHAM:

10:39.875 --> 10:41.834
Morning, everyone!

10:41.875 --> 10:42.834
Graham?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.542
You seem different.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.959
Happy even.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.959
What's up?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
Obviously just took

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
a little while

10:49.625 --> 10:51.417
for my "cool" lessons

10:49.625 --> 10:51.417
to kick in.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.166
How are you feeling,

10:51.458 --> 10:53.166
son?

10:53.208 --> 10:55.542
Much better,

10:53.208 --> 10:55.542
thanks to science.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.625
Science? What do you mean?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.125
I didn't like

10:57.667 --> 10:59.125
Kade's cologne,

10:59.166 --> 11:01.291
but the theory behind it

10:59.166 --> 11:01.291
seemed logical.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.417
So I experimented

11:01.333 --> 11:04.417
with creating my own blend.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.417
Come on.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.291
( sniffs )

11:08.333 --> 11:09.542
Wow.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.458
( sniffs ):

11:09.583 --> 11:11.458
That smell is...

11:11.500 --> 11:13.291
Awesome! Really.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.208
Nice work, bro.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.417
The formula works molecularly,

11:17.458 --> 11:19.875
so when people get a whiff,

11:17.458 --> 11:19.875
they basically start to...

11:19.917 --> 11:21.417
like me.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.625
So your problem

11:21.458 --> 11:23.625
talking to girls--

11:23.667 --> 11:25.667
Is solved!

11:23.667 --> 11:25.667
This does the hard part.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.166
I call it,

11:27.208 --> 11:29.625
"Confident Me."

11:27.208 --> 11:29.625
( sniffs ): Mmm.

11:29.667 --> 11:30.667
Because that's what it does.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.458
Makes me...confident.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.750
( phone rings )

11:35.375 --> 11:37.458
Griffin Rock emergency.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.458
Right away, Mr. Pfeiffer.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.458
There's a fire at the bakery!

11:41.500 --> 11:43.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:43.709 --> 11:45.291
( police siren wailing )

11:47.959 --> 11:49.792
Mr. Pfeiffer's trapped inside!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.125
Heatwave, clear a hole.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.834
( coughing )

12:03.750 --> 12:05.625
If you cannot take the heat,

12:05.667 --> 12:08.208
I advise you

12:05.667 --> 12:08.208
to stay out of the bakery.

12:10.834 --> 12:13.750
Judging from these scorch marks,

12:10.834 --> 12:13.750
the fire started in here.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.625
What's this?

12:15.667 --> 12:18.458
It looks like something

12:15.667 --> 12:18.458
chewed a hole in the oven.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.667
Good news, Doctor Morocco.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.375
That overnight package

12:22.709 --> 12:25.375
with more ants came.

12:25.417 --> 12:26.625
Big too,

12:26.667 --> 12:29.500
must be thousands of them in--

12:29.542 --> 12:30.792
Here.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:35.750 --> 12:39.500
Huxley Prescott, at the scene

12:35.750 --> 12:39.500
of the Griffin Rock Bakery Fire.

12:39.542 --> 12:40.625
Well uh, uh...

12:40.667 --> 12:42.500
( sniffs )

12:42.542 --> 12:45.875
Graham Burns, can you tell us

12:42.542 --> 12:45.875
what happened here?

12:45.917 --> 12:48.458
Well, Hux,

12:45.917 --> 12:48.458
if I can call you that,

12:48.500 --> 12:50.750
it appears that a structural

12:48.500 --> 12:50.750
failure in the bakery oven

12:50.792 --> 12:53.041
caused the conflagration.

12:53.083 --> 12:57.500
HUXLEY ( on TV ):

12:53.083 --> 12:57.500
Intelligent, heroic,

12:53.083 --> 12:57.500
and he smells good!

12:57.542 --> 12:59.834
Your city

12:57.542 --> 12:59.834
is in good hands, viewers!

12:59.875 --> 13:01.917
(  news theme playing  )

13:01.959 --> 13:04.417
Wow, that new cologne must

13:01.959 --> 13:04.417
really be working, Graham.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.750
I've never seen you

13:04.458 --> 13:06.750
so confident on camera.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.333
Well, it helps to know

13:06.792 --> 13:08.333
people will be nice

13:08.375 --> 13:09.792
as soon as they smell me.

13:09.834 --> 13:12.709
Graham. You don't need

13:09.834 --> 13:12.709
any artificial odor

13:12.750 --> 13:14.625
to get me to like you-- Yow!

13:14.667 --> 13:15.834
What was that?

13:15.875 --> 13:17.625
It felt like a needle.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.667
Uh,

13:19.709 --> 13:20.917
it's just an ant.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.625
How could an ant hurt Boulder?

13:22.667 --> 13:23.917
That's weird.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.333
Hey, Graham,

13:26.375 --> 13:28.083
looks like you

13:26.375 --> 13:28.083
have some ants on you too.

13:30.875 --> 13:34.667
Who knew such cute, tiny insects

13:30.875 --> 13:34.667
could have such sharp teeth?

13:34.709 --> 13:35.917
CHIEF:

13:34.709 --> 13:35.917
Listen up everyone!

13:35.959 --> 13:37.792
The MorBot

13:35.959 --> 13:37.792
is attacking the prison.

13:37.834 --> 13:38.792
Barney barely got away.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.500
Huh?

13:38.834 --> 13:40.500
What?

13:40.542 --> 13:42.083
This development

13:40.542 --> 13:42.083
makes no sense.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.875
We scrapped that hunk of junk

13:42.125 --> 13:45.875
a hundred emergencies ago!

13:45.917 --> 13:48.875
Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!

13:48.917 --> 13:50.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:50.917 --> 13:55.458
Splendid job, my robotic minion.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.458
And the Verne device.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.458
Mustn't leave home without it.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.333
( sirens wailing )

14:10.500 --> 14:12.542
Hold it right there,

14:10.500 --> 14:12.542
Doctor Morocco!

14:12.583 --> 14:15.792
Love to chat. But I must fly.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.375
( engines igniting )

14:32.583 --> 14:34.834
I can do this all day.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.250
Let's test that claim.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.041
This is your queen, my army.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.041
Attack!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.166
What's that supposed to mean?

14:44.792 --> 14:46.083
Ow!

14:46.125 --> 14:47.709
KADE:

14:46.125 --> 14:47.709
Dude, they're just ants.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.500
How could they even

14:47.750 --> 14:49.500
possibly hurt you?

14:49.542 --> 14:53.250
They're not "just ants",

14:49.542 --> 14:53.250
you pompous lackwit.

14:53.291 --> 14:57.750
They're a rare mutant strain

14:53.291 --> 14:57.750
of Maragunta Army ants.

14:57.792 --> 15:01.166
Their bite contains formic acid

14:57.792 --> 15:01.166
that can eat through metal!

15:01.208 --> 15:02.709
Ugh. He's not kidding.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.834
They're nasty.

15:05.875 --> 15:09.208
You had your ants chew through

15:05.875 --> 15:09.208
the oven at the bakery.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.709
You knew the fire would keep us

15:09.250 --> 15:11.709
busy while you escaped.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.625
Indeed.

15:13.667 --> 15:17.709
This device makes the bugs

15:13.667 --> 15:17.709
think I'm their ruler

15:17.750 --> 15:21.917
and I just commanded them to

15:17.750 --> 15:21.917
eat all the metal they can find.

15:21.959 --> 15:24.709
So. You can spend the day

15:21.959 --> 15:24.709
battling me,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.834
or save

15:24.750 --> 15:27.834
your precious town from ruin.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.500
( engines igniting )

15:31.667 --> 15:34.125
Blades, copter mode.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.000
We'll keep an eye on him, Dad.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.000
Good idea, Dani. Go!

15:36.041 --> 15:38.000
Cody,

15:38.041 --> 15:40.166
any sign of Morocco's ant army?

15:42.792 --> 15:43.834
( yelps )

15:45.875 --> 15:47.667
( gasps )

15:47.709 --> 15:49.625
They're swarming downtown, Dad.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.709
( people screaming )

15:55.834 --> 15:57.792
Keep an eye out

15:55.834 --> 15:57.792
for those ants, team.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.500
Focus on the places

15:57.834 --> 15:59.500
where damaging metal

15:59.542 --> 16:00.959
could do any harm.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.834
That's kind of

16:01.000 --> 16:02.834
the whole island, Dad.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.250
( meows angrily )

16:10.125 --> 16:12.083
Hope ants like waterslides.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.125
Bath time, bugs.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.875
No, Heatwave!

16:17.917 --> 16:19.500
You can't send the ants

16:17.917 --> 16:19.500
into the sewers!

16:19.542 --> 16:21.417
They'll eat through

16:19.542 --> 16:21.417
the metal pipes.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.792
And I am not handling

16:21.458 --> 16:23.792
that disaster.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.000
Attention, ants:

16:27.041 --> 16:29.500
You seem like reasonable

16:27.041 --> 16:29.500
and well-organized creatures.

16:29.542 --> 16:31.750
Obey the law

16:29.542 --> 16:31.750
and cease this vandalism.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.041
( sighs )

16:34.083 --> 16:35.834
Were I but a queen.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.875
Maybe you can be.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.750
Cody? Call Doc.

16:39.792 --> 16:42.208
We need to find out

16:39.792 --> 16:42.208
how Morocco's gizmo works.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.875
( on monitor ):

16:42.250 --> 16:45.875
An ant-commanding transmitter,

16:42.250 --> 16:45.875
you say?

16:45.917 --> 16:49.208
Fascinating! If Doctor Morocco

16:45.917 --> 16:49.208
is using radio waves,

16:49.250 --> 16:50.834
he must be sending out

16:50.875 --> 16:52.750
electronic versions

16:50.875 --> 16:52.750
of pheromones.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.083
Fear moans?

16:54.125 --> 16:55.166
FRANKIE:

16:54.125 --> 16:55.166
Ha, ha, ha!

16:55.208 --> 16:57.250
Pheromones.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.834
They're how ants communicate

16:57.291 --> 16:59.834
over distance.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.875
Since they can't talk, they use

16:59.875 --> 17:02.875
smells to give instructions.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.083
So one scent might tell them

17:02.917 --> 17:05.083
to build an ant-hill,

17:05.125 --> 17:06.875
another tells them

17:05.125 --> 17:06.875
to defend it.

17:06.917 --> 17:09.000
It may be ingenious,

17:06.917 --> 17:09.000
but all those ants

17:09.041 --> 17:12.000
are still obeying Morocco's

17:09.041 --> 17:12.000
last command, "attack."

17:12.041 --> 17:15.041
If ants talk to each other using

17:12.041 --> 17:15.041
these pheromone smell orders,

17:15.083 --> 17:17.125
maybe we can

17:15.083 --> 17:17.125
give them a new command,

17:17.166 --> 17:19.166
with "Confident Me."

17:19.208 --> 17:22.417
Uh...

17:19.208 --> 17:22.417
What does you having confidence

17:22.458 --> 17:24.542
have to do

17:22.458 --> 17:24.542
with talking to ants?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.166
No, Graham's cologne.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.166
"Confident Me."

17:27.208 --> 17:28.875
It makes people nice to him.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.166
I even saw a few ants

17:28.917 --> 17:31.166
that seemed to like it.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.250
If Graham used enough cologne,

17:33.291 --> 17:36.000
I bet we could get the ants

17:33.291 --> 17:36.000
to stop attacking the town.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.625
It's worth a try.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.166
Dani? What's your position?

17:40.625 --> 17:42.125
DANI:

17:40.625 --> 17:42.125
Over the water, Dad.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.792
But we lost

17:42.166 --> 17:44.792
the MorBot in a cloud bank.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.875
CHIEF:

17:44.834 --> 17:46.875
Never mind,

17:44.834 --> 17:46.875
I need you at the Firehouse

17:46.917 --> 17:50.166
to pick up a little "surprise"

17:46.917 --> 17:50.166
for our ant friends.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:57.875 --> 18:00.959
Ah, freedom at last,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.875
and smooth sailing from here.

18:02.917 --> 18:03.875
( sighs )

18:03.917 --> 18:06.333
What's this?

18:06.375 --> 18:07.917
No!

18:07.959 --> 18:10.041
You accursed little beasts!

18:10.083 --> 18:13.125
Professor Crumpet,

18:10.083 --> 18:13.125
is that y--? Ow!

18:13.166 --> 18:15.667
Attention,

18:13.166 --> 18:15.667
you miserable insects!

18:15.709 --> 18:17.792
Stop eating my metal!

18:17.834 --> 18:20.000
( yelps )

18:20.041 --> 18:22.250
( engines sputtering )

18:24.917 --> 18:26.041
( screams )

18:32.125 --> 18:35.125
Here, Dani. Take this to the

18:32.125 --> 18:35.125
ant swarm as fast as you can.

18:37.375 --> 18:41.000
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:41.041 --> 18:43.125
Amy, we just learned

18:41.041 --> 18:43.125
there may be

18:43.166 --> 18:44.917
some structural issues

18:43.166 --> 18:44.917
developing.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.834
Can you make sure

18:44.959 --> 18:46.834
these kids get to safety?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.792
Sure thing, Graham.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.250
Let's go, guys.

18:53.375 --> 18:55.041
( metal creaking )

18:53.375 --> 18:55.041
( gasps )

18:56.875 --> 18:58.208
( screams )

18:58.250 --> 19:00.000
(  tense theme playing )

19:03.709 --> 19:05.500
( metal creaks )

19:09.917 --> 19:11.875
On my count.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.875
One,

19:11.917 --> 19:13.333
two,

19:13.375 --> 19:14.834
three!

19:14.875 --> 19:17.000
( all grunt )

19:17.041 --> 19:19.041
( all yelping in pain )

19:21.208 --> 19:23.083
DANI ( on PA ):

19:21.208 --> 19:23.083
A little "Confident Me"

19:23.125 --> 19:24.875
for all of you.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.166
(  upbeat theme playing  )

19:37.375 --> 19:39.959
Fly low and slow, Blades.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.709
We'll meet you

19:40.000 --> 19:41.709
at Doc's lab.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.083
(  triumphant theme playing  )

19:50.250 --> 19:51.917
Kudos, Graham.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.750
Your cologne proved quite

19:51.959 --> 19:55.750
an elegant solution.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.291
Good job, everyone.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.333
We saved

19:58.333 --> 20:00.333
Griffin Rock from...

20:00.375 --> 20:02.583
Well, its tiniest

20:00.375 --> 20:02.583
threat yet.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.458
Final check

20:10.000 --> 20:11.458
on the motor,

20:11.500 --> 20:13.917
and the "new" new slide

20:11.500 --> 20:13.917
is ready to open.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.709
Well, I gotta hand it to you,

20:13.959 --> 20:15.709
little brother,

20:15.750 --> 20:17.458
that cologne really works.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.166
I may even borrow

20:17.500 --> 20:19.166
a little myself.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.166
Ha, ha.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.166
Not that I need it.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.041
Sorry, Kade.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.041
I got rid of it.

20:23.083 --> 20:26.083
Wha-- What? Oh.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.750
I realized, it can be dangerous

20:26.125 --> 20:29.750
to play with pheromones.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.000
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.291
You never actually

20:33.917 --> 20:36.291
needed the cologne, you know.

20:36.333 --> 20:39.417
What do you mean?

20:36.333 --> 20:39.417
Heatwave sprayed you, remember?

20:39.458 --> 20:41.333
It washed

20:39.458 --> 20:41.333
the pheromones off.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.875
When you saved everyone here,

20:42.917 --> 20:45.000
your confidence

20:42.917 --> 20:45.000
didn't come from a bottle.

20:45.041 --> 20:48.709
It came from doing

20:45.041 --> 20:48.709
what you're best at.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.959
( gasps )

20:48.750 --> 20:49.959
( chittering )

20:50.000 --> 20:51.625
AMY:

20:50.000 --> 20:51.625
I'm sorry!

20:51.667 --> 20:56.875
It seems like I just can't keep

20:51.667 --> 20:56.875
Tesla away from you.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.667
Hi, Amy.

20:58.709 --> 21:01.709
Um, would you like to see the

20:58.709 --> 21:01.709
final blueprints for the slide?

21:01.750 --> 21:04.041
It's pretty...noble.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.750
( giggles shyly )

21:05.792 --> 21:07.041
Uh-huh...

21:10.834 --> 21:12.291
Everything okay, Dad?

21:12.333 --> 21:15.083
I just wish

21:12.333 --> 21:15.083
we'd caught Doctor Morocco.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.000
Somehow I doubt

21:15.125 --> 21:18.000
we've seen the last of him.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.375
( grunts )

21:20.417 --> 21:22.000
( grunts )

21:22.041 --> 21:23.041
( metal eroding )

21:26.959 --> 21:28.458
( groans )

21:31.458 --> 21:33.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )
