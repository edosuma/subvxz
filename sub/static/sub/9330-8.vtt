WEBVTT

00:01.033 --> 00:03.888
All right, Emma, let's see what
kind of adventure today brings.

00:03.988 --> 00:05.021
(blender whirs)

00:05.072 --> 00:07.324
Whoo, ha ha!

00:07.358 --> 00:09.309
Looks like we won't have to go very far.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.911
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

00:10.962 --> 00:13.897
Just making some signature
cocktails for the bar. Yeah.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.299
The Tucktini.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.236
The Tuckarita.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.154
And the Long Island Iced Tuck.

00:22.356 --> 00:26.059
You know, which also
happens to be my rap name.

00:28.045 --> 00:30.981
Thank god I still have
my job bartending for you.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.933
Yeah, about that.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.051
It pains me to see you
give up on your dream job.

00:35.086 --> 00:37.020
Yeah, well, I think I
need to get a new dream.

00:37.054 --> 00:39.956
'Cause it's not like they're
just handing out terrific jobs.

00:39.991 --> 00:42.242
Guess who just got a terrific job!

00:43.477 --> 00:46.941
I just got poached by the best
real estate firm in the city.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.007
Wow, great news!

00:49.042 --> 00:51.760
Bad timing.

00:51.811 --> 00:52.895
But I haven't even
told you the best part.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.780
I get to hire an assistant.

00:54.831 --> 00:57.749
Right now, I'm deciding between
a struggling underwear model,

00:57.784 --> 01:00.586
and that hot Jesus impersonator
who roams Times Square.

01:01.721 --> 01:02.988
Oh my god, what about Tucker?

01:02.990 --> 01:05.524
Tucker would be an amazing assistant.

01:05.558 --> 01:07.659
Mmm, I don't know.

01:07.661 --> 01:09.561
It'd be weird to sexually harass Tucker.

01:11.915 --> 01:12.965
But you'd get to yell at him,

01:13.016 --> 01:15.000
so you'd be getting paid
to do something you love.

01:16.836 --> 01:18.820
Well, as they say in
the real estate biz:

01:18.855 --> 01:19.788
I guess so.

01:21.674 --> 01:23.825
So, what do you say, Tuck?
You wanna be my assistant?

01:23.877 --> 01:25.711
No thank you, all right?

01:25.713 --> 01:27.729
And plus, I already
have a job at the bar

01:27.780 --> 01:29.748
where I'm appreciated and respected.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.583
Tucker, you're fired.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.669
Great. When do I start?

01:33.720 --> 01:36.638

01:46.049 --> 01:48.000
Hey, man, thanks again
for coming in this morning.

01:48.002 --> 01:50.169
This is the third time Sam's been late.

01:50.171 --> 01:53.005
I swear, if she wasn't so
hot, I'd be really pissed.

01:53.056 --> 01:55.007
No worries.

01:55.009 --> 01:56.175
Sorry I'm moving kinda
slow this morning.

01:56.177 --> 01:59.011
Slept over at Riley's last
night, my neck's killing me.

01:59.062 --> 02:00.146
Slept wrong?

02:00.180 --> 02:03.149
Sure. Let's go with that.

02:03.183 --> 02:06.018
You know, I've been spending
so much time over there lately,

02:06.020 --> 02:07.937
I'm thinking maybe we
should move in together,

02:07.988 --> 02:10.021
but I'm worried it might be
too soon. What do you think?

02:10.024 --> 02:12.024
I think you're not thinking.

02:12.075 --> 02:14.160
You asked her to marry you
before you had your first date,

02:14.194 --> 02:16.078
and you saw how quickly
you regretted that.

02:16.113 --> 02:18.164
Yeah, that was a bad day.

02:18.198 --> 02:19.115
Thanks for the advice, man.

02:21.118 --> 02:23.169
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
I know I am super late.

02:23.203 --> 02:25.037
Oh, no, it's cool.

02:25.039 --> 02:27.957
Oh, and one of
your buttons is...

02:28.008 --> 02:29.041
it was perfect.

02:29.092 --> 02:31.177
I've been commuting from
my parents' house in Jersey.

02:31.211 --> 02:33.129
I could not spend one more
night with my roommate.

02:33.180 --> 02:36.048
When the cat to person
ratio passes five-to-one,

02:36.050 --> 02:37.049
I'm out.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.135
But, if I don't find a new place soon,

02:39.186 --> 02:42.104
I'm gonna have to quit and
find a job closer to home.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.222
Quit?

02:43.273 --> 02:46.142
No, no, no, you can't quit!
There's so much we haven't...

02:46.193 --> 02:48.144
There's just so much we haven't.

02:48.195 --> 02:51.230
Unless you know of an amazing
place for close to no money,

02:51.232 --> 02:52.982
I'm afraid I'm out of here.

02:53.033 --> 02:54.066
I'm out of here!

02:56.203 --> 02:58.954
This is so crazy.

02:59.005 --> 03:00.973
Danny was just telling me
he's moving in with Riley,

03:01.024 --> 03:03.959
and he needs someone to take his room.

03:04.010 --> 03:06.011
Looks like today is
my I... your lucky day!

03:08.982 --> 03:10.349
(phone ringing)

03:10.384 --> 03:12.952
Bonnie Wheeler's office,
Tucker Dobbs speaking.

03:12.986 --> 03:14.170
How may I help you?

03:16.189 --> 03:18.124
Mrs. Wheeler, knock it off!

03:18.175 --> 03:20.242
Ha! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:20.277 --> 03:24.130
I just love hearing you say
it. "Bonnie Wheeler's office."

03:24.181 --> 03:26.982
Oh, it's time the world
finally hears about this woman.

03:27.033 --> 03:29.168
Strong, smart, fearless.

03:29.170 --> 03:29.952
(door opening)

03:29.978 --> 03:32.129
Oh, god, it's my boss,
quick, look busy!

03:32.155 --> 03:32.955
Move my 4:00 to 3:00,

03:32.981 --> 03:35.007
Bonnie Wheeler's office, can
you hold for a little bit?

03:35.009 --> 03:36.942
My 3:00 to 1:00, my 1:00 to
2:00, and my 2:00 to 3:00.

03:36.993 --> 03:37.477
Can you hold?

03:37.503 --> 03:39.412
I don't want any free time.
I just want to get out there

03:39.446 --> 03:42.314
- and sell, sell, sell!
- Mmm, I love it, I love it, I love it!

03:42.316 --> 03:44.333
Jumping right in like
the pro I knew you were.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.937
Oh, Luis, I just want to thank
you so much for this opportunity.

03:47.971 --> 03:49.205
No, thank you.

03:49.239 --> 03:50.272
If you trust me, I guarantee

03:50.307 --> 03:52.224
this will be the wildest
ride of your life.

03:52.259 --> 03:53.275
Well, that's funny,

03:53.326 --> 03:55.294
I'm usually the one that says that.

03:55.328 --> 03:56.295
Walk with me, Bonnie.

03:56.346 --> 03:58.197
Okay.

03:58.231 --> 04:01.000
And we're here.

04:01.051 --> 04:03.185
This is it. My baby.

04:03.220 --> 04:06.956
We have the exclusive
rights to all 347 units.

04:06.990 --> 04:09.925
Studios starting at one million dollars.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.010
For a studio?

04:11.044 --> 04:12.945
- Mm-hmm.
- That's insane...

04:12.947 --> 04:15.931
if buyers aren't lining up.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.950
That is why I have you.

04:17.983 --> 04:20.886
All those contacts and famous names
you mentioned during your interview?

04:20.937 --> 04:22.371
You should have no problem.

04:22.405 --> 04:24.323
So many accomplishments,

04:24.325 --> 04:28.110
and still just 32 years old.

04:28.145 --> 04:29.128
<i>Fantastico!</i>

04:29.130 --> 04:30.179
<i>Wow. Ay, caramba!</i>

04:33.166 --> 04:35.100
You don't have any contacts, do you?

04:35.152 --> 04:37.970
Of course I do.

04:38.004 --> 04:39.972
Hey, Dolores, did you hear?

04:40.023 --> 04:42.908
They're giving away free
doughnuts in the break room.

04:42.959 --> 04:44.009
Run, run, run, run, run.

04:46.046 --> 04:47.963
Quick. Copy all the contacts off this,

04:47.998 --> 04:49.031
and then wipe it for fingerprints.

04:52.352 --> 04:54.320
- Hold the elevator.
- Oh.

04:54.354 --> 04:56.355
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry, Riles.

04:56.357 --> 04:58.290
It's hard for me to move
fast when I've got Emma.

04:58.292 --> 05:01.093
Hey, speaking of moving,

05:01.127 --> 05:02.294
when are you and Danny
planning on moving in together?

05:02.329 --> 05:05.064
Actually, never mind.

05:05.115 --> 05:07.049
He's probably not ready
to give up his room yet.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.985
It's important to have an escape plan.

05:10.036 --> 05:12.071
I'm sorry, an escape what?

05:12.105 --> 05:13.956
Hey, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything,

05:13.990 --> 05:16.959
but you can't really blame him
since you turned down his proposal.

05:16.993 --> 05:18.327
You're obviously not super committed.

05:20.347 --> 05:24.183
Uh, I'm committed, I'm so
committed. How am I not committed?

05:24.217 --> 05:26.218
Oh, okay, so you do
want to move in together?

05:26.253 --> 05:28.204
What? No.

05:28.255 --> 05:30.272
I mean, I haven't even thought about it.

05:30.307 --> 05:33.092
But if I did think
about it, I'd think...

05:33.143 --> 05:35.060
I'd think it was okay.

05:35.111 --> 05:36.629
I think.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.065
Okay, if you don't want to lock it
down with him, that's so your business.

05:40.116 --> 05:41.951
- (elevator dings)
- I'm staying out of it.

05:41.985 --> 05:44.036
Oh, here we are.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.405
See you later, Riles.

05:46.456 --> 05:48.390
I mean, I feel like I'm
pretty committed to this rela...

05:48.425 --> 05:49.942
Oh, god!

05:49.976 --> 05:51.293
And now for my second trick,

05:51.328 --> 05:53.312
I'll be making Danny disappear.

05:54.447 --> 05:57.349
Hey, bro, so I've been
thinking about our conversation,

05:57.384 --> 05:59.218
and you gotta stop worrying about it.

05:59.252 --> 06:01.253
I'm sure Riley's not
having any second thoughts.

06:01.288 --> 06:04.189
Second thoughts. Who said
anything about second thoughts?

06:04.241 --> 06:06.091
Well, you just did, for one.

06:06.126 --> 06:09.061
But hey, it's none of my business.

06:09.112 --> 06:10.996
Though, is it just me,

06:11.047 --> 06:13.949
or is it wrong that she always
demands you stay at her place,

06:13.984 --> 06:16.051
but she's not willing to
let you officially move in?

06:16.086 --> 06:18.070
Nah, I'm sure it's just me.

06:18.104 --> 06:19.305
(elevator dings)

06:19.339 --> 06:21.006
Oh, I think I just heard the elevator.

06:21.057 --> 06:22.291
I wonder if that's her?

06:22.325 --> 06:23.359
I'll be right back.

06:23.410 --> 06:24.910
And to think,

06:24.961 --> 06:26.345
just five seconds ago, I
thought everything was fine.

06:29.332 --> 06:30.933
Pay attention, Emma.

06:30.967 --> 06:33.202
In a couple years you'll be
able to manipulate Danny, too.

06:33.253 --> 06:35.104
Danny: What do you mean
you're having second thoughts?

06:35.138 --> 06:36.238
Riley: I didn't say that!

06:36.289 --> 06:38.173
Now what could that be?

06:38.208 --> 06:39.224
Why don't you want to live with me?

06:39.259 --> 06:41.076
I don't know, maybe we should try it.

06:41.111 --> 06:42.912
- I'd love that!
- So would I!

06:42.946 --> 06:44.113
- So we're gonna live together?
- I guess we are!

06:44.147 --> 06:45.381
- Great!
- Fantastic!

06:45.415 --> 06:47.049
- Should we kiss?
- I think so.

06:49.953 --> 06:50.953
Okay, so here's how it goes,

06:51.004 --> 06:52.354
Sam moves into Danny's room,

06:52.389 --> 06:53.956
Sam falls in love with me,

06:53.990 --> 06:55.240
Sam moves into my room,

06:55.242 --> 06:56.258
you move into Danny's room.

06:56.293 --> 06:57.226
- You got it?
- Yeah.

06:57.260 --> 06:59.311
Yeah, high five. Pound
it. Woogity woogity.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.183
I am exhausted.

07:04.234 --> 07:07.119
600 attempts, and 600 rejections.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.105
It's like my junior high years
before I got these babies.

07:13.093 --> 07:16.078
You know, this is a lot
harder than I thought.

07:16.112 --> 07:18.080
I've only manged to get like, 10 offers.

07:18.114 --> 07:20.065
I'm sorry.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.034
- Did you say...
- 10 units!

07:22.036 --> 07:25.020
♪ 10 units in only one day! ♪

07:25.055 --> 07:28.958
Bonnie Wheeler has just sold 10 units!

07:29.009 --> 07:31.010
That's unbelievable!

07:31.012 --> 07:33.362
The rest of you are all fired.

07:33.413 --> 07:36.348
No, you're not. I love you.

07:36.350 --> 07:37.349
But you could be!

07:39.219 --> 07:40.269
How did you do it?

07:40.303 --> 07:42.121
W... Well,
I... I...

07:42.172 --> 07:43.288
Yeah, I'll tell you how she did it,

07:43.290 --> 07:45.991
she hired an amazing assistant...

07:48.028 --> 07:49.895
who pumped her full of coffee,

07:49.946 --> 07:51.380
so she could sell, sell, sell.

07:51.414 --> 07:52.998
(laughing)

07:53.049 --> 07:54.400
Exactly what he said.

07:54.434 --> 07:56.318
Brilliant. Keep up the good work.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.972
You. You actually are fired.

08:01.925 --> 08:03.876
Oh my god, thank you, Tucker,

08:03.927 --> 08:06.862
for selling and not selling me out.

08:06.896 --> 08:08.881
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go into my office,

08:08.915 --> 08:10.349
and figure out how to sell some condos.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.254
Sorry, Dolores.

08:15.256 --> 08:17.156
Doughnuts are for closers.

08:21.995 --> 08:24.897
Sam: I love it. It's perfect.

08:24.948 --> 08:27.900
Are you sure this isn't gonna be weird?

08:27.934 --> 08:29.051
No, not weird at all.

08:29.085 --> 08:31.036
In fact, it allows me to prove

08:31.071 --> 08:33.938
that I'm past the crazy idea that
there was something between us.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.275
There was never anything between us.

08:36.326 --> 08:37.926
Perfect. Then we're on the same page.

08:39.279 --> 08:40.361
Now, I don't know about you,

08:40.413 --> 08:42.381
but this is the time of
night when I like to unwind

08:42.383 --> 08:44.133
- with a glass of wine,
- (Knocking)

08:44.167 --> 08:45.150
and then
maybe I'll...

08:47.303 --> 08:49.071
- Hey, babe!
- Hey, babe.

08:49.105 --> 08:50.072
Hi.

08:50.106 --> 08:51.123
Babe?

08:51.125 --> 08:54.043
Blake, this is my
roomie, Ben. Ben, Blake.

08:54.077 --> 08:55.110
Hey, bro.

08:55.161 --> 08:57.029
You guys are gonna be
seeing a lot of each other.

08:57.063 --> 08:58.931
You have to see my room.

09:01.084 --> 09:03.268
(screaming)

09:07.059 --> 09:08.794
Blake. Bye bye, Sam.

09:08.894 --> 09:11.429
Danny's moving back home.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.397
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, you're home.

09:13.448 --> 09:14.832
Yeah. Yeah, you wanna
know how you find that out?

09:14.866 --> 09:17.702
If you knocked or called
or rang the doorbell.

09:17.736 --> 09:19.720
Really, there are so many choices.

09:19.755 --> 09:21.555
Sorry. Is Danny home?

09:21.607 --> 09:22.623
He left this at our place.

09:22.658 --> 09:24.492
Oh, he's at the gym.
He'll be home any minute.

09:24.543 --> 09:26.477
And you can keep that.
It won't fit here.

09:26.511 --> 09:27.578
It's too, um...

09:27.613 --> 09:29.447
It won't fit here.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.515
Oh, okay.

09:31.566 --> 09:33.484
Okay, so that's what
Danny was talking about.

09:35.904 --> 09:38.422
Uh, I'm sorry, what
was Danny talking about?

09:38.473 --> 09:39.807
Oh, nothing, nothing. No big deal.

09:39.858 --> 09:41.792
Something about walking on egg shells.

09:41.843 --> 09:43.911
The word "intense" may or may
not have been thrown around.

09:43.945 --> 09:46.747
I really can't remember.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.683
But it would be weird not
to have second thoughts

09:48.685 --> 09:49.784
after jumping into something so huge

09:49.786 --> 09:51.719
without really thinking it through.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.671
Ah! I wouldn't worry about it.

10:00.662 --> 10:02.630
Hey, man, early morning workout.

10:02.681 --> 10:05.533
Great idea. Perfect way to
relieve some of that stress.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.451
What stress? There's no stress.

10:07.486 --> 10:08.836
Whoa, calm down, man!

10:09.938 --> 10:11.922
It's okay, I'm your brother.

10:11.957 --> 10:14.809
So what if this move
is too much, too soon.

10:14.843 --> 10:16.744
Too much, too soon? Who said that?

10:16.795 --> 10:18.813
Well, you just did, for one.

10:18.864 --> 10:19.947
Oh, never mind.

10:19.998 --> 10:22.717
I'm sure you won't regret
it for the rest of your life.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.702
Oh, here's your snowboard.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:35.664 --> 10:37.631
(murmuring frantically)

10:37.666 --> 10:39.950
Oh, hey, Tucker, there you are.

10:39.985 --> 10:41.635
Hey, do I seem jittery to you?

10:41.670 --> 10:44.872
I think I invented something this
morning called "super coffee."

10:44.906 --> 10:47.942
It's a combination of regular coffee and
some pills I found in Dolores's desk.

10:49.911 --> 10:51.746
What is wrong with you?

10:51.797 --> 10:52.880
Wait, have you been here all night?

10:52.882 --> 10:55.816
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

10:55.818 --> 10:59.820
Hey, did you know that people don't
like to be cold-called at 3:00 a.m.?

10:59.855 --> 11:02.623
Yeah, definitely burned some bridges.

11:02.625 --> 11:06.527
<i>But I started calling Japan,
where it's 10:00 a.m. Konichiwa.</i>

11:06.578 --> 11:07.595
And it worked.

11:07.629 --> 11:08.646
And I sold two units.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.499
I mean, I know it's not
your 10, but it's a start.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.467
- It's a start. It's a start.
- Actually it's 11.

11:13.502 --> 11:14.568
I sold another one on the way in.

11:14.603 --> 11:15.519
(phone beeps)

11:15.570 --> 11:16.537
Ooh, make that 12.

11:17.956 --> 11:19.473
Oh, my god.

11:19.524 --> 11:20.524
Of course you did.

11:20.559 --> 11:23.878
Because you are perfect and talented,

11:23.880 --> 11:25.946
and I am just a total nothing

11:25.997 --> 11:27.915
with nowhere to go but down!

11:27.949 --> 11:29.850
Oh my god, don't even look at me!

11:29.885 --> 11:31.702
Oh, god.

11:31.753 --> 11:32.955
(sobbing)

11:33.055 --> 11:34.989
Well, you know...

11:35.041 --> 11:36.975
Mrs. Wheeler, maybe real
estate just isn't your thing?

11:37.009 --> 11:38.893
- Shut up!
- Oh, my god!

11:38.944 --> 11:41.996
Ah, I see what's going on now, huh.

11:41.998 --> 11:44.766
- What?
- This is all a big plan.

11:44.817 --> 11:46.868
Play the mild-mannered
assistant. You know,

11:46.919 --> 11:48.269
"Bonnie Wheeler's office,

11:48.304 --> 11:50.872
how may I steal your business
and destroy your career?"

11:50.906 --> 11:52.791
- Get out!
- I am so gone!

11:52.842 --> 11:54.175
Oh my god, you can't leave me!

11:54.210 --> 11:55.276
I am nothing without you!

11:55.311 --> 11:57.112
Okay, okay!

11:57.163 --> 12:00.765
Okay, okay, we have really got to work on
getting these mood swings under control.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.134
I know. I know. I know, I
know, I know, you're right.

12:03.169 --> 12:05.136
You know, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

12:05.171 --> 12:07.989
Just, last night I just
kept having these visions

12:08.040 --> 12:10.091
of you marching into Luis's office

12:10.093 --> 12:12.911
and telling him that you
sold all those listings

12:12.962 --> 12:14.896
and I'm a complete fraud.

12:16.065 --> 12:18.967
I would never tell him that.

12:19.018 --> 12:20.835
But you just did.

12:22.972 --> 12:25.190
Walk with me, Bonnie.

12:27.209 --> 12:28.209
- Come on.
- I don't wanna.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.194
It's okay.

12:35.101 --> 12:37.168
Well, this just got a little harder.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.023
Hey, roomie.

12:42.074 --> 12:44.859
Um, Sam, I have some bad news.

12:44.861 --> 12:46.945
Things aren't going so
well with Danny and Riley,

12:46.979 --> 12:48.830
and Danny needs his room back.

12:48.864 --> 12:49.881
Really?

12:49.915 --> 12:51.833
Oh, that sucks.

12:51.835 --> 12:53.902
Just got the bathroom
clean enough to use it.

12:53.953 --> 12:56.254
Well, hey, maybe you can stay
at your boyfriend Blake's place?

12:56.288 --> 12:59.157
Though, you are still
welcome to do your yoga here.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.759
Blake's not my boyfriend,

13:01.811 --> 13:04.212
but he would probably
love to be your boyfriend.

13:06.132 --> 13:08.066
I'm not...

13:08.117 --> 13:09.968
Oh, my god.

13:10.002 --> 13:11.136
Gay best friend.

13:11.170 --> 13:14.956
Totally got it. Can you
excuse me for just two seconds?

13:14.990 --> 13:16.124
- Oh, hey, Ben.
- That way, that way, that way!

13:18.110 --> 13:20.028
Hey, what's Sam doing in our place?

13:20.079 --> 13:21.996
Things I've only dreamed of.

13:22.047 --> 13:23.932
What are you doing with all your stuff?

13:23.983 --> 13:26.918
Oh, Riley helped me realize that
we shouldn't move in together yet.

13:26.969 --> 13:29.237
Thank god I still have an old room.

13:29.271 --> 13:30.872
Oh, my god, dude,

13:30.923 --> 13:32.841
do you know anything about women?

13:32.892 --> 13:35.193
She was just testing you to
see if you're really committed.

13:35.244 --> 13:36.794
But I'm totally committed.

13:36.846 --> 13:39.080
Says the guy walking out the door.

13:39.114 --> 13:42.050
Now you get back in there, and you show
her how committed you can be, all right?

13:42.084 --> 13:43.134
Get back in there, tiger.

13:43.169 --> 13:45.069
Okay.

13:45.104 --> 13:47.121
Okay. False alarm.

13:47.123 --> 13:49.057
I think those two crazy
lovebirds are gonna be just fine.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.946
Am I the only one who sees the
wet, naked man in the living room?

13:54.980 --> 13:56.915
This is Ludo.

13:56.949 --> 13:59.884
Now, he is my boyfriend.

13:59.935 --> 14:01.903
'Sup, little guy?

14:04.807 --> 14:06.908
Excuse me for two seconds.

14:06.942 --> 14:09.811
Danny: Well, maybe if you weren't always
testing me like I'm some kind of lab rat,

14:09.845 --> 14:11.112
we could work this out!

14:11.146 --> 14:12.814
We're done!

14:12.865 --> 14:16.217
Oh, oh, we are not done
until I say we're done!

14:18.120 --> 14:20.038
We're done.

14:21.056 --> 14:22.190
You're done?

14:22.192 --> 14:24.042
What have I done?

14:24.093 --> 14:25.126
Danny, wait!

14:30.446 --> 14:33.181
Well that's the fastest
I've ever been fired.

14:33.183 --> 14:36.251
And that includes the job
I got and forgot to go to.

14:36.285 --> 14:38.186
You know what the worst part is?

14:38.221 --> 14:41.156
You don't even care about real
estate, and you're good at it.

14:41.207 --> 14:43.225
I care and I fail.

14:43.259 --> 14:45.493
But this isn't even what
I want to do with my life.

14:45.528 --> 14:48.430
Okay? You know, I still want to
become an entertainment reporter.

14:48.432 --> 14:50.382
Yeah, well, a good time to mention that

14:50.416 --> 14:52.384
might have been when
Luis gave you my job.

14:52.418 --> 14:55.370
Yeah, I might have got
caught up in the moment.

14:55.404 --> 14:58.340
I just wish there was some way
I could get a second chance.

14:58.342 --> 14:59.741
(elevator dings)

14:59.792 --> 15:02.310
Oh, so you're saying you're sorry
you wasted all these months dating me?

15:02.345 --> 15:05.363
No, I'm saying I wasted the last
20 years being in love with you!

15:05.398 --> 15:08.233
Okay, guys, I don't know who put
these crazy thoughts in your head,

15:08.267 --> 15:10.185
but this has to stop.

15:10.187 --> 15:11.236
Danny, come on!

15:11.287 --> 15:13.121
Yeah, just walk away, Wheeler!

15:13.155 --> 15:15.090
I mean, that's what you do best!

15:17.159 --> 15:18.460
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

15:18.511 --> 15:21.129
Oh, my god, Riley, what happened?

15:21.163 --> 15:22.530
Did you and Danny break up?

15:22.532 --> 15:24.516
Because I have got a
lot on my plate today,

15:24.550 --> 15:26.501
and I cannot be here
to pick up the pieces.

15:28.387 --> 15:29.521
No, we're fine.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.424
Okay, Ben tricked Danny and
me into moving in together

15:32.458 --> 15:34.376
so he could move Sam into your place.

15:34.410 --> 15:36.311
So, we're just teaching
him a little lesson.

15:36.345 --> 15:39.214
Wait, Ben got Sam to move in?

15:39.248 --> 15:43.301
Oh, god, he makes me so proud sometimes.

15:43.336 --> 15:46.171
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

15:46.222 --> 15:49.157
Oh. You're dead to me, Danny Wheeler!

15:52.111 --> 15:54.195
Wait, I think I know
how to get my job back.

15:54.246 --> 15:57.115
Luis overheard us telling the truth.

15:57.149 --> 15:59.050
What if he overheard us again,

15:59.085 --> 16:03.021
only this time, the truth is a lie?

16:03.072 --> 16:06.474
That's dishonest,
disrespectful, and despicable.

16:06.509 --> 16:09.327
- So you're in?
- I thought that was clear.

16:15.384 --> 16:17.319
See, the lights are on.

16:17.353 --> 16:19.170
I told you he works late.

16:19.205 --> 16:20.171
You ready?

16:22.158 --> 16:25.093
What are you doing here, Bonnie Wheeler?

16:25.127 --> 16:27.145
I'm trying to get my job back, remember?

16:27.196 --> 16:30.031
Oh, we're doing it now.

16:30.082 --> 16:33.051
I know what you did, Tucker Dobbs!

16:33.085 --> 16:35.086
You lied about all those sales

16:35.121 --> 16:36.521
just to get my job!

16:36.555 --> 16:39.457
Yes, but Luis will never find out!

16:39.492 --> 16:42.477
I'll destroy him like I destroyed you!

16:44.447 --> 16:46.264
I don't hear anything.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.183
These walls must be really thick.

16:48.234 --> 16:49.401
Maybe we should make
more of a commotion?

16:49.435 --> 16:52.187
Oh. Oh, I can make a commotion.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.290
(grunting)

16:55.341 --> 16:57.175
Allow me.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.483
What are you doing here, Tucker?

17:05.518 --> 17:07.085
I just found out

17:07.118 --> 17:09.436
that you were the
one who... Oh, dammit!

17:11.156 --> 17:13.391
He's not even here.

17:13.425 --> 17:16.010
I should have known
this would never work.

17:16.061 --> 17:18.413
Thank you for trying to help me.

17:18.446 --> 17:22.367
But you know, I think I want to
get my job back the right way.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.419
I just need to tell Luis the truth.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.387
Bonnie, Tucker?

17:26.422 --> 17:27.422
What are you doing here?

17:27.473 --> 17:31.176
Tucker lied about everything!
I tried to stop him!

17:31.210 --> 17:32.327
That works too.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.295
Is this true?

17:34.330 --> 17:39.084
Yup. Yeah, I'm a horrible person.

17:39.118 --> 17:41.186
Tucker, you're fired.

17:41.220 --> 17:45.407
Bonnie, how can I make it up to you?

17:45.441 --> 17:46.474
Walk with me, Luis.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.545
First of all, you really
should fire that Dolores.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.380
She's a bit of a pill-popper.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.436
So, do you think we should
let him off the hook?

17:58.471 --> 18:00.321
I think he's suffered enough.

18:00.323 --> 18:03.308
Oh, that's so sweet that
you want to go easy on him.

18:03.342 --> 18:05.226
Okay, but I want blood.

18:05.277 --> 18:07.295
Just follow my lead.

18:07.297 --> 18:09.297
Lead? What lead?

18:09.348 --> 18:11.282
There you are. Thank you
guys so much for coming.

18:11.317 --> 18:13.118
Why did you call us here?

18:13.169 --> 18:14.269
If he's here, I don't want to be here.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.187
Yeah, if
he's here...

18:16.222 --> 18:18.156
wait, if she's here, I
don't want to be here.

18:18.207 --> 18:21.059
Okay, okay, okay, everyone just needs
to take a deep breath, all right?

18:21.110 --> 18:24.045
You guys cannot break up
over something so silly.

18:24.079 --> 18:26.014
I mean, who even
remember who started it?

18:26.065 --> 18:27.065
I know I don't.

18:27.099 --> 18:29.067
You know, it doesn't
matter how it started.

18:29.118 --> 18:30.452
The point is that it's ended.

18:30.486 --> 18:31.503
Yeah, it's ended.

18:31.554 --> 18:33.388
Or has it?

18:34.523 --> 18:36.324
(guitar music plays)

18:36.358 --> 18:40.228
Danny and Riley, this is your love.

18:40.279 --> 18:44.182
You met on a crisp fall morning
at the kindergarten bus stop.

18:44.216 --> 18:46.251
You were inseparable
during your young years,

18:46.285 --> 18:48.319
your teen years, and
even your awkward years.

18:48.370 --> 18:50.338
Coincidentally, those were all the same.

18:52.191 --> 18:54.309
And plus, if you guys
don't stay together,

18:54.311 --> 18:56.211
these angels will never be born.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.447
Oh, they're so cute.

19:01.116 --> 19:04.052
Kids? Why would I want
to have kids with him?

19:04.103 --> 19:06.154
He is the laziest man
that has ever lived.

19:06.156 --> 19:08.072
Just yesterday,

19:08.107 --> 19:09.424
I asked him to paint the apartment.

19:09.475 --> 19:10.475
But did he?

19:10.509 --> 19:12.477
I'll do it! I'll do it! I love painting!

19:12.528 --> 19:15.497
Yeah. Yeah, well,

19:15.531 --> 19:18.584
what... what about the
fact that he never stops

19:18.610 --> 19:21.344
your family from just
barging in any time?

19:21.370 --> 19:23.505
I mean, does anybody not
have a key to my apartment?

19:23.507 --> 19:25.473
Here's mine! Here's mine.

19:25.475 --> 19:27.442
And I'll get everyone else's, I promise.

19:29.278 --> 19:31.279
Well...

19:31.330 --> 19:34.332
what am I supposed to do about
the issue of his bar schedule?

19:34.366 --> 19:36.334
When he's not playing
hockey, he's working.

19:36.368 --> 19:37.418
I'll cover all of his shifts.

19:37.469 --> 19:40.388
Anything else, please,
guys, just don't break up.

19:40.422 --> 19:44.425
And you're sure you're cool with
living with Sam and her boyfriend?

19:44.427 --> 19:46.477
Oh, my god, the coolest.

19:46.512 --> 19:47.478
Sort of.

19:49.398 --> 19:50.398
So, what do you guys say?

19:53.319 --> 19:54.402
- I mean, sure, that sounds great.
- Okay.

19:54.436 --> 19:55.436
Ready to go home, babe?

19:55.438 --> 19:57.322
- Sounds good to me.
- Okay.

19:58.524 --> 20:00.441
(sighs)

20:00.443 --> 20:02.277
Yes.

20:04.330 --> 20:07.365
Hey, how'd you guys know about Sam?

20:07.416 --> 20:08.499
Damn it!

20:08.534 --> 20:10.418
Who else was in on this?

20:13.993 --> 20:15.603
Hey, wanna join me?

20:15.703 --> 20:16.786
Ah, no, I'm good.

20:16.886 --> 20:18.886
Wouldn't want to get in
the way of you and Ludo.

20:18.937 --> 20:20.888
Actually, Ludo and I just broke up.

20:22.974 --> 20:24.057
I'm so sorry to hear
that. What happened?

20:26.027 --> 20:28.896
He was jealous that I was
living with a cute guy.

20:28.947 --> 20:31.064
But it's okay. He wasn't the one.

20:32.901 --> 20:34.902
So, the one is still
out there somewhere?

20:35.987 --> 20:37.070
We'll see.

20:37.121 --> 20:38.071
(knocking)

20:38.122 --> 20:39.990
That must be my date.

20:40.041 --> 20:41.875
See ya.

20:42.911 --> 20:43.877
(door opens)

20:44.913 --> 20:45.996
(door closes)

20:46.047 --> 20:47.047
(screaming)
