another day of the '90s.

32:33.550 --> 32:36.144
That horrible grunge look...

32:36.320 --> 32:38.288
...did not suit you.

32:38.488 --> 32:41.048
Remember, Stefan,
it's important to stay away from fads.

32:41.224 --> 32:43.419
Why are you here?

32:43.961 --> 32:46.088
- I missed my brother.
- You hate small towns.

32:46.296 --> 32:48.628
It's boring.
There's nothing for you to do.

32:49.433 --> 32:51.060
I've managed to keep myself busy.

32:51.234 --> 32:53.259
You know,
you left that girl alive tonight.

32:53.437 --> 32:55.132
That's very clumsy of you.

32:55.305 --> 32:57.273
That could be a problem...

32:57.441 --> 32:58.703
...for you.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.475
Why are you here now?

33:03.313 --> 33:05.406
I could ask you the same question.

33:05.582 --> 33:07.607
However, I'm fairly certain...

33:07.784 --> 33:11.242
...your answer can be summed up
all into one little word:

33:11.455 --> 33:13.218
Elena.

33:19.262 --> 33:20.729
MAN:
Okay.

33:35.879 --> 33:37.005
[SIREN WAILS]

33:37.381 --> 33:40.373
Hey, we're gonna go mainline coffee
and wait for news.

33:42.452 --> 33:43.851
I gotta take Jeremy home.

33:44.021 --> 33:47.821
Elena, there's no way I'm psychic.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.754
I know that.

33:50.460 --> 33:54.658
But whatever I saw,
or I think I saw...

33:55.165 --> 33:56.826
...I have this feeling...

33:58.468 --> 34:00.402
Bonnie, what?

34:03.473 --> 34:05.771
- That it's just the beginning.

34:08.378 --> 34:10.039
<i>DAMON:
She took my breath away.</i>

34:10.981 --> 34:12.346
Elena.

34:13.483 --> 34:15.382
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

34:17.554 --> 34:21.251
Is it working, Stefan?
Being around her? Being in her world?

34:21.425 --> 34:24.292
- Does it make you feel alive?
- She's not Katherine.

34:24.494 --> 34:27.429
Well, let's hope not.
We both know how that ended.

34:28.864 --> 34:32.357
Tell me, when's the last time you had
something stronger than a squirrel?

34:33.503 --> 34:35.300
I know what you're doing, Damon.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.166
Yeah? Don't you crave a little?

34:37.373 --> 34:39.342
- Stop it.
- Let's do it together.

34:39.943 --> 34:43.504
I saw a couple girls out there. Or just...
Let's just cut to the chase.

34:43.713 --> 34:45.543
Let's just go straight for Elena.

34:45.715 --> 34:48.547
- Stop it!
- Imagine what her blood tastes like.

34:49.553 --> 34:50.850
I can.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.521
I said stop!

34:52.688 --> 34:54.350
[GROWLS]

34:59.996 --> 35:01.395
[GROANS]

35:06.903 --> 35:08.837
I was impressed.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.371
I give it a six. You missed on style,
but I was pleasantly surprised.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.445
Very good
with the whole face...

35:18.615 --> 35:19.639
[GROWLS]

35:19.816 --> 35:21.716
- Thing. It was good.

35:21.885 --> 35:24.217
Yeah, it's all fun and games,
Damon, huh?

35:24.387 --> 35:26.287
But wherever you go, people die.

35:27.357 --> 35:29.257
- That's a given.
- Not here.

35:29.426 --> 35:30.984
I won't allow it.

35:31.962 --> 35:34.487
- I take that as an invitation.
- Damon, please.

35:34.731 --> 35:37.427
After all these years,
can't we just give it a rest?

35:37.601 --> 35:41.901
I promised you an eternity of misery,
so I'm just keeping my word.

35:42.072 --> 35:44.472
Just stay away from Elena.

35:46.910 --> 35:49.003
Where's your ring?

35:50.947 --> 35:54.246
Oh, yeah, the sun's coming up
in a couple hours...

35:54.417 --> 35:57.181
...and, poof, ashes to ashes.

35:59.923 --> 36:01.322
[CHUCKLES]

36:01.491 --> 36:03.118
Relax.

36:04.761 --> 36:06.820
It's right here.

36:20.143 --> 36:23.044
You should know better than to think
you're stronger than me.

36:23.213 --> 36:26.410
You lost that fight
when you stopped feeding on people.

36:26.983 --> 36:28.610
I wouldn't try it again.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.287
[THUMP]

36:33.790 --> 36:35.849
I think we woke Zach up.

36:37.294 --> 36:38.386
Sorry, Zach.

36:38.562 --> 36:40.086
[DAMON WHISTLING]

36:51.374 --> 36:53.069
You okay?

36:56.546 --> 36:59.174
I called Jenna. She's on her way.

37:02.219 --> 37:04.016
Those people in uniforms?

37:04.187 --> 37:06.985
Last time I checked,
they're the police.

37:14.197 --> 37:19.066
People are gonna stop
giving you breaks, Jer.

37:19.236 --> 37:21.830
They just don't care anymore.

37:22.339 --> 37:25.103
They don't remember
that our parents are dead.

37:25.275 --> 37:27.607
They've got their own lives
to deal with.

37:29.112 --> 37:31.740
The rest of the world has moved on.

37:32.849 --> 37:34.214
You should try too.

37:34.417 --> 37:36.908
I've seen you in the cemetery
writing in your diary.

37:37.087 --> 37:39.555
Is that supposed to be you
moving on?

37:43.760 --> 37:46.194
Mom and Dad
wouldn't have wanted this.

37:53.903 --> 37:55.234
Are you sober yet?

37:57.607 --> 37:58.767
Nope.

37:58.942 --> 38:02.378
Keep drinking. I gotta get you home.
I gotta get me home.

38:03.146 --> 38:04.773
Why didn't he go for me?

38:06.082 --> 38:09.984
How come the guys that I want
never want me?

38:10.153 --> 38:12.815
- I'm not touching that.
- I'm inappropriate.

38:13.056 --> 38:15.786
I always say the wrong thing.

38:16.459 --> 38:20.919
And Elena always says the right thing.

38:21.631 --> 38:24.156
Ugh. She doesn't even try.

38:24.401 --> 38:28.428
And he just picks her. And she's always
the one that everyone picks...

38:28.605 --> 38:30.072
...for everything.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.973
And I try so hard...

38:35.745 --> 38:38.509
...and I'm never the one that...

38:38.682 --> 38:41.617
It's not a competition, Caroline.

38:45.755 --> 38:47.848
Yeah, it is.

39:12.215 --> 39:13.512
Hey.

39:13.717 --> 39:15.776
Hey. It's okay.

39:15.952 --> 39:18.443
- You're gonna be okay. Shh.
- Matt...

39:18.655 --> 39:22.352
Hey, don't try to talk, okay? You're fine.

39:24.561 --> 39:26.586
Vampire.

39:35.171 --> 39:36.604
<i>ELENA:
Dear diary...</i>

39:37.874 --> 39:40.001
<i>... I couldn't have been more wrong.</i>

39:40.176 --> 39:43.703
<i>I thought that I could smile
and nod my way through it.</i>

39:43.880 --> 39:46.371
<i>Pretend like it would all be okay.</i>

39:52.422 --> 39:54.356
<i>STEFAN:
I had a plan.</i>

39:55.158 --> 39:57.820
<i>I wanted to change who I was.</i>

39:58.194 --> 40:00.822
<i>Create a life as someone new.</i>

40:01.431 --> 40:03.865
<i>Someone without the past.</i>

40:04.033 --> 40:06.160
<i>ELENA:
Without the pain.</i>

40:06.569 --> 40:08.696
<i>ELENA AND STEFAN:
Someone alive.</i>

40:12.575 --> 40:14.736
<i>ELENA:
But it's not that easy.</i>

40:15.378 --> 40:17.778
<i>The bad things stay with you.</i>

40:18.014 --> 40:19.948
<i>STEFAN:
They follow you.</i>

40:25.688 --> 40:27.849
<i>You can't escape them...</i>

40:28.291 --> 40:30.088
<i>... as much as you want to.</i>

40:47.043 --> 40:49.978
<i>ELENA: All you can do is be ready
for the good...</i>

40:50.180 --> 40:54.879
<i>... so when it comes, you invite it in
because you need it.</i>

40:56.252 --> 40:58.049
<i>I need it.</i>

41:05.762 --> 41:06.820
I know it's late...

41:09.899 --> 41:12.595
...but I needed to know
that you were okay.

41:12.769 --> 41:17.206
You know, for months,
that's all anyone's wondered about me...

41:17.707 --> 41:18.765
...if I'll be okay.

41:19.976 --> 41:21.000
What do you tell them?

41:23.313 --> 41:25.281
That I'll be fine.

41:26.282 --> 41:27.579
Do you ever mean it?

41:30.220 --> 41:32.154
Ask me tomorrow.

41:36.159 --> 41:38.923
It's warmer in the house.
We can talk.

41:41.998 --> 41:43.260
Would you like to come in?

41:46.503 --> 41:47.731
Yes.
