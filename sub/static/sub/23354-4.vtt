WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:05.806
Tonight,
on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:05.839 --> 00:07.941
Mojito's Cuban Cafe
feels like the set

00:07.974 --> 00:08.942
of a soap opera

00:08.975 --> 00:11.978
that stars two hot Latin lovers.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.714
They were once
romantic newlyweds...

00:13.747 --> 00:16.183
Everybody say,
"You are the perfect couple."

00:16.216 --> 00:17.918
Proud owners of a restaurant

00:17.951 --> 00:19.419
they treated
like a newborn baby.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.554
It's everything for me.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.723
Today, the passion is gone.

00:22.756 --> 00:23.724
The marriage is over.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.425
And the business
is on the rocks.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.626
Get it together,
Marcelo.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.627
Control.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.096
Listen,
I can't control everything.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.000
She used to show respect
for me.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.164
She used to show respect
for me.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.299
Not now.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.934
Do it, do it,
do it now.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.638
Always
at each other's throats...

00:39.906 --> 00:41.608
The staff is constantly caught
in the crossfire.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.310
Who's trying to sabotage this?

00:47.414 --> 00:49.282
Katalina and Marcelo's
constant fighting...

00:49.316 --> 00:50.684
They're--
Let me talk.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.319
Is definitely hurting
the restaurant.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.653
To save Mojito's,

00:53.687 --> 00:56.223
Chef Ramsay must find out
what killed the marriage.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.324
Did she meet another man?
Yeah.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.925
Do you love him?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.000
Or these two soul mates will see

01:00.000 --> 01:00.026
Or these two soul mates will see

01:00.060 --> 01:01.528
The death of their dream.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.696
You're not doing it right

01:02.729 --> 01:03.997
Because it's not perfect.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.365
Go out of my kitchen!

01:05.399 --> 01:07.401
Tonight, the soap opera

01:07.434 --> 01:08.702
of Mojito's.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.770
Do you think it's time

01:09.803 --> 01:11.104
That one of you
says good-bye?

01:34.394 --> 01:35.429
Brooklyn, New York,

01:35.462 --> 01:37.030
Just across the East River
from Manhattan.

01:37.063 --> 01:40.434
This historic neighborhood
has become

01:40.467 --> 01:41.802
a hip and trendy place
to live.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.738
Seven years ago,
Kata and Marcelo moved here

01:44.771 --> 01:46.640
just after they got married.

01:46.673 --> 01:49.209
We always wanted
to have a restaurant and wanted

01:49.242 --> 01:51.478
to make our dream come true.

01:51.511 --> 01:56.616
We decide to open a restaurant--
Mojito's, a Cuban food.

01:56.649 --> 01:59.552
We live together upstairs
in the apartments.

01:59.585 --> 02:00.000
Hi, guys.
How are you? Welcome.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.953
Hi, guys.
How are you? Welcome.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.892
I been cooking my whole life,
and I love it.

02:06.926 --> 02:09.262
We share responsibilities
of the restaurant.

02:09.295 --> 02:13.432
He takes the back house,
and I take the front house.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.801
I do the food, the orders,

02:15.835 --> 02:17.103
The payroll.

02:17.136 --> 02:18.404
I do everything.

02:18.437 --> 02:21.474
About a year
after we opened the restaurant,

02:21.507 --> 02:23.743
things started going very bad.

02:23.776 --> 02:24.844
Kata!

02:24.877 --> 02:27.747
Marcelo and I
are constantly fighting.

02:27.780 --> 02:28.981
Just have a look
at the rice.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.000
The rice--
you're right there.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.149
The rice--
you're right there.

02:30.182 --> 02:31.150
Yes, we are on it.

02:31.183 --> 02:32.652
Marcelo, why don't you listen
to me?

02:32.685 --> 02:35.488
What? Let me finish my way
in my way.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.029
Isn't that your responsibility?

02:44.563 --> 02:45.898
Do it, do it,
do it now.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.235
That's not the way
you make it.

02:49.268 --> 02:50.369
I don't respect Marcelo

02:50.403 --> 02:52.538
because he doesn't know
how to handle pressure.

02:52.571 --> 02:53.873
Where are the guava
and cheese here?

02:53.906 --> 02:55.308
You're the chef,
and you don't know?

02:57.243 --> 02:58.444
They will fight
in front of customers.

03:00.212 --> 03:01.480
It gets ugly.

03:10.389 --> 03:12.525
We destroy a marriage,

03:12.558 --> 03:14.527
And I don't want
to destroy my restaurant.

03:15.561 --> 03:17.296
Zero.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.765
We have invested
everything we have.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.301
Like, $300,000.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.671
If I lost the restaurant,
I would lose my dream.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.807
I would lose my baby.
This is my baby.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.000
I sacrifice for Mojito's
my relationship...

03:30.000 --> 03:30.876
I sacrifice for Mojito's
my relationship...

03:30.910 --> 03:32.578
Where is Kata?

03:32.611 --> 03:34.714
The most important thing
I have.

03:34.747 --> 03:38.751
Mojito's destroy our lives.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.055
Sorry.

03:49.895 --> 03:52.131
Mojito, the restaurant
I'm about to visit,

03:52.164 --> 03:54.400
what I do know is it's the only
Cuban restaurant in Brooklyn,

03:54.433 --> 03:55.801
so that has to be a big plus.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.069
But what I don't know is,

03:57.103 --> 03:58.771
why do they need my help?

03:58.804 --> 04:00.000
Right.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.507
Right.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.242
Well, hello.

04:03.275 --> 04:05.378
Hi.
Hi.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.148
Hello. First name is?
Katalina.

04:09.181 --> 04:10.182
Katalina.
Nice to meet you.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.484
Nice meeting you.

04:11.517 --> 04:12.785
And you're the...

04:12.818 --> 04:14.253
I'm one of the owners/chef.

04:14.286 --> 04:15.755
Okay.
I have a partner.

04:15.788 --> 04:16.756
Marcelo is his name.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.758
Right.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.126
We used to be married. We've
been separated for two years.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.595
You used to be married?
To my partner.

04:22.628 --> 04:23.929
Oh,.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.264
It's just like water and oil.

04:25.297 --> 04:26.332
We just don't mix anymore.

04:26.365 --> 04:28.801
It's just like conflict
all the time.

04:28.834 --> 04:29.902
It's all about the food.

04:29.935 --> 04:30.000
I'll have a look
through the menu.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.936
I'll have a look
through the menu.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.238
Nice to meet you.
Same here.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.340
Okay, enjoy your lunch.
Thank you.

04:34.373 --> 04:35.641
Oh, my God.

04:35.674 --> 04:38.310
Real interesting decor.

04:38.344 --> 04:44.316
Yeah, it's almost like a sort of
garage sale gone wrong.

04:44.383 --> 04:45.551
How are you, sir?

04:45.584 --> 04:46.585
Good. How are you?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.787
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thank you.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.389
Let's start off
with chicken classic soup.

04:50.423 --> 04:53.058
And let's go
for the pescata marinara.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.393
My favorite.
Yeah?

04:54.427 --> 04:55.895
Absolutely.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.930
I really believe Chef Ramsay
gonna like the food.

04:57.963 --> 05:00.000
I think that 97% of my food
will be great.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.768
I think that 97% of my food
will be great.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.037
Thank you very much.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.405
That was very fast.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.473
Very fast indeed.

05:07.506 --> 05:13.412
Let's hope it's good.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.980
It's cold.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.982
I don't want to be a pain
in the ass,

05:17.016 --> 05:18.150
but could I have the soup hot?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.419
It's cold.
Hot! It's cold.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.987
Let me get that hot
for you, okay?

05:22.021 --> 05:24.557
Absolutely.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.226
He would like a hot soup.
Not cold.

05:27.259 --> 05:28.928
Who say that?
Ramsay said.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.536
What happened with the soup?

05:37.570 --> 05:39.839
I have a thermometer here.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.607
Boiling hot.
You want to check?

05:41.640 --> 05:42.942
You want to check
with me?

05:42.975 --> 05:43.943
It wasn't boiling hot?

05:43.976 --> 05:46.312
It's boiling hot.

05:49.081 --> 05:51.083
Before you guys send
something out,

05:51.116 --> 05:52.751
please check,
double check,

05:52.785 --> 05:55.087
triple check,
and check one more time.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.088
Yes, yes, yes.

05:56.121 --> 05:57.790
Listen.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.696
I'm sorry about that.
Don't worry.

06:03.729 --> 06:05.097
Just when I went
to taste these,

06:05.130 --> 06:07.566
these are so salty.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.035
I mean, you'd need six mojitos

06:10.069 --> 06:12.204
before you start eating
six spoons of that.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.205
You're right.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.273
They're disgusting.

06:14.306 --> 06:16.408
Excuse me.
Let me take this back.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.610
What a shame.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.445
They couldn't even get
the basics right.

06:19.478 --> 06:22.181
Do me a favor.
Try the beans.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.483
Marcelo, try the beans.

06:28.487 --> 06:29.488
Salty as hell.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.000
Throw it out!

06:30.000 --> 06:31.924
Throw it out!

06:31.957 --> 06:33.893
Get it together,
Marcelo! Control!

06:33.926 --> 06:35.461
Listen,
I can't control everything!

06:37.229 --> 06:38.597
Take a spoon,
and you taste everything.

06:38.631 --> 06:39.665
I'm gonna taste,
but listen--

06:39.698 --> 06:41.233
No, they're salty.
Throw them out.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.235
Exchange 'em for new ones.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.236
Shh.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.339
Shh.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.109
Holy crap.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.110
Get out of here.

06:51.143 --> 06:52.745
It's my kitchen.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.080
My God.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.884
There's definitely, definitely a
lack of harmony in the kitchen.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.000
It's getting cold.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.319
It's getting cold.

07:00.352 --> 07:02.187
Instead of arguing, do it,
do it, do it, do it now.

07:02.221 --> 07:04.890
"I want this one
right--right now."

07:06.191 --> 07:07.259
Oh, my God.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.261
It's gonna be
a complete disaster.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.163
Change the beans,
and do what you have to do.

07:11.196 --> 07:12.164
Then go out here.

07:12.197 --> 07:13.265
I'm not going out.
I'm not.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.667
Go out here.
Go out of my kitchen.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.035
Go out of my kitchen.
Go out of my kitchen.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.203
Go out of my kitchen now.

07:19.538 --> 07:20.739
How you doing?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.774
Yeah, fine, thank you.

07:21.807 --> 07:23.242
And you?
I'm fine.

07:23.275 --> 07:24.443
Can I get you anything else
while you wait for the food?

07:24.476 --> 07:25.978
No, I'm gonna wait
for the tilapia.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.146
Okay.
Thank you.

07:27.179 --> 07:28.180
I hope it comes out right.

07:28.213 --> 07:29.615
Thank you very much.
All right.

07:29.648 --> 07:30.000
Wow. I know.
I can't believe it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.817
Wow. I know.
I can't believe it.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.353
The beans,
the basic of us.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.823
I hope you enjoy it
because it's actually

07:37.856 --> 07:39.325
My favorite dish.
Thank you.

07:41.193 --> 07:42.428
"Delicious."

07:42.461 --> 07:46.065
Wow.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.334
He love it.
Yeah. He loves it.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.769
The fish is not cooked.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.871
The fish is not cooked?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.573
Ah, it's really not.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.109
That is a shame.

07:57.142 --> 07:59.178
♪ I'm gonna bring it back

07:59.211 --> 08:00.000
that's a very big mistake

08:00.000 --> 08:00.412
that's a very big mistake

08:00.446 --> 08:01.780
on behalf of the kitchen.

08:04.249 --> 08:06.018
Not cooked.

08:06.051 --> 08:07.586
Raw fish.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.521
What's wrong with you guys?

08:09.555 --> 08:11.256
It's raw.
It's not cooked.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.859
I put the tester,
the oven tester--

08:13.892 --> 08:15.060
No good.
Raw.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.228
This is raw.
Raw fish.

08:16.261 --> 08:17.262
Raw, raw, raw.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.931
This never comes raw.

08:18.964 --> 08:21.000
What's wrong?
Eh?

08:21.033 --> 08:22.001
Excuse me.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.469
Santa Catalina, please.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.903
Marcelo cannot handle pressure.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.406
He should not be
in the kitchen at all.

08:27.439 --> 08:30.000
One, two, three filters, and
everything's coming out wrong?

08:30.000 --> 08:30.042
One, two, three filters, and
everything's coming out wrong?

08:30.075 --> 08:31.677
It's unbelievable!

08:31.710 --> 08:33.178
Good-bye.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.347
Bitch.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.516
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares...

08:37.549 --> 08:38.550
I'm the boss here.

08:38.584 --> 08:39.952
You have to listen to me.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.187
The chaos goes
from bad to worse.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.789
Kata is out of control.

08:43.822 --> 08:44.857
Marcelo, get out
of the kitchen.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.625
Get out of the kitchen.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.826
And Marcelo is out the door.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.628
What's wrong
with this girl?

08:49.662 --> 08:50.796
Then you're not gonna believe

08:50.829 --> 08:51.897
What's hidden downstairs.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.666
Chef Ramsay's shocking discovery

08:53.699 --> 08:55.434
that makes everyone sick.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.203
I could not believe my eyes.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.338
Can Chef Ramsay bring
these two together

08:59.371 --> 09:00.000
and get the restaurant
back on track?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.206
and get the restaurant
back on track?

09:01.240 --> 09:02.641
Do you think it's time
that one of you

09:02.675 --> 09:04.276
says good-bye?

09:04.309 --> 09:05.644
Or will one of them walk out

09:05.678 --> 09:07.379
Of the restaurant for good?

09:07.413 --> 09:08.981
See you later.

09:09.014 --> 09:10.883
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.194
After a terrible lunch service,

09:21.227 --> 09:23.763
Chef Ramsay wants to meet Kata's
business partner Marcelo,

09:23.796 --> 09:26.432
as well as the chefs responsible
for his meal.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.735
How are you?
Fine, thank you.

09:28.768 --> 09:29.936
Yeah?
Good, and this is?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.804
Eduardo.
Eduardo.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.240
Okay, let me just tell you
something.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.275
Lunch was a disaster.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.710
Who is the head chef?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.212
I am the head.
You are the head chef.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.680
Yes.
Talk to me
about the black beans.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.419
Was that perfect?

09:42.419 --> 09:42.448
Was that perfect?

09:42.482 --> 09:43.716
No, the beans was not perfect.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.251
It was salty.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.486
Who cooked the tilapia?
I cook.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.521
It was raw.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.522
I could hear
a lot of shouting.

09:49.555 --> 09:50.723
Is that normal?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.425
That's all we hear every day.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.559
What do you mean every day?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.961
Every single day.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.865
Kata's always pushing me,
pushing me.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.233
I say, "Listen,
do your thing.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.467
Let me do my thing."

10:01.501 --> 10:04.704
But she's in her thing
and my thing all together.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.573
Checking your performance.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.775
You are not my boss.

10:08.808 --> 10:09.876
I'm not your boss.
I'm your partner.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.517
Do you still live together?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.218
- No.
- No, we separated.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.987
He lives in his own apartment.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.688
And I live here
in the building.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.023
Upstairs?
Upstairs.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.758
Upstairs.
Literally upstairs.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.994
Oh, dear.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.695
Okay, right now,
I need some fresh air.

10:29.729 --> 10:30.897
I'm gonna go for a walk.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.699
And I'll be in service tonight,

10:33.733 --> 10:35.401
watching everything.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.970
And try to do a better job

10:38.004 --> 10:40.106
than you did for me lunchtime.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.240
Okay?

10:41.274 --> 10:42.419
I'll be back.

10:42.419 --> 10:42.608
I'll be back.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.920
After a miserable lunch,

10:53.953 --> 10:56.289
Chef Ramsay wants to see
how this feuding couple

10:56.322 --> 10:58.257
handles dinner service.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.359
Guys, Chef Ramsay's here.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.929
Please keep focus
and do everything according.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.630
Don't send anything out
that is not right.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.070
Because she just talk and talk

11:11.103 --> 11:12.419
and talk and talk
and talk, talk, talk, talk.

11:12.419 --> 11:13.639
and talk and talk
and talk, talk, talk, talk.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.048
What's all that
on the windows there?

11:22.081 --> 11:23.616
- What is all that?
- The blue bottles?

11:23.649 --> 11:25.251
They're just for decoration.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.620
Decoration?
Decoration. That's it.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.690
Water, but...
What have you colored it with?

11:30.723 --> 11:33.793
Toilet bowls.
Toilet bowls?

11:33.826 --> 11:35.795
To make the blue water,

11:35.828 --> 11:37.129
and I put it in there.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.098
I mean, I've heard
of restaurants

11:39.131 --> 11:40.566
bottling water but...

11:40.600 --> 11:41.767
It's just for decoration.

11:41.801 --> 11:42.419
Just for decoration?
Not for drink.

11:42.419 --> 11:43.603
Just for decoration?
Not for drink.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.804
Not for drink.
Not for human consumption.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.305
Unless you've eaten here.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.876
Word has spread

11:49.909 --> 11:51.410
of Chef Ramsay's arrival
in Brooklyn.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.879
Hi, how are you?

11:52.912 --> 11:54.313
And Mojito's is busier
than usual.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.882
You guys have a reservation?
Yes.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.316
Either one of these two tables.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.118
Enjoy your dinner, guys.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.156
Can I just do, like,
the grilled shrimp?

12:04.190 --> 12:05.725
Yes.
Thank you.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.059
With the first orders in,

12:07.093 --> 12:08.060
Chef Ramsay is looking forward

12:08.094 --> 12:10.029
to seeing the head chef
in action.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.864
Marcelo?

12:11.898 --> 12:12.419
Marcelo.

12:12.419 --> 12:12.932
Marcelo.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.302
Are you expediting?

12:16.335 --> 12:17.770
Yes.
You are?

12:17.803 --> 12:19.272
You could open up
and at least talk.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.710
The kitchen staff, we do
so much better without Marcelo.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.779
Stop putting the tickets

12:26.812 --> 12:29.415
that I'm already
starting there here

12:29.448 --> 12:31.450
'cause it's all  me up.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.718
He doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.853
There is no appetizer.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.388
There is an appetizer.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.522
Oh, yeah, you're right.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.724
What is that for?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.393
That's for A3.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.419
A--A3?
Yes!

12:42.419 --> 12:43.429
A--A3?
Yes!

12:44.430 --> 12:47.033
No, I need it...

12:47.066 --> 12:48.034
Clearly, Marcelo has no control

12:48.067 --> 12:49.068
Of his kitchen.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.236
Oh, my God.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.804
Not only is food slowly making

12:51.837 --> 12:54.740
Its way to the dining room...

12:54.774 --> 12:57.076
The dishes are not exactly
being well-received.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.946
Paella's horrible.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.547
Really?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.186
All right, I'll be happy to have
them fix that for you, okay?

13:07.219 --> 13:08.220
What's the matter?
They're undercooked.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.488
They wanted them cooked
a little bit more.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.591
Marcelo,

13:11.624 --> 13:12.419
please keep checking
that everything that comes out--

13:12.419 --> 13:12.858
please keep checking
that everything that comes out--

13:12.892 --> 13:15.394
we check it already.
we got it.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.964
We got it.
We got it.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.966
Marcelo doesn't expedite.
He doesn't have consistency.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.501
He just like send things out
just to get 'em out of the way.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.003
They ordered
the shrimp quesadilla,

13:24.036 --> 13:26.606
But the gentleman says
that he really doesn't like it.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.541
Would you like to order
something instead of that?

13:28.574 --> 13:30.876
I don't want you
to go home hungry.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.079
No problem.
I'm sorry, guys.

13:33.112 --> 13:36.215
Let me have this.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.450
Question.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.918
Who made this?
You guys should know better.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.187
How can you allow food
to come out like that nasty?

13:41.220 --> 13:42.419
Not nasty.

13:42.419 --> 13:42.421
Not nasty.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.856
We are doing something.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.458
You're gonna tell me

13:45.491 --> 13:46.525
The quesadilla's supposed
to be crispy,

13:46.559 --> 13:47.760
and it was, like, soggy.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.695
No, not crispy.

13:49.729 --> 13:50.963
It's not crispy.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.964
It's supposed to be nicer.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.132
The bad part of Kata

13:53.165 --> 13:54.433
is that she's not
actually hands-on.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.935
She's just adding fire.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.103
Are you trying
to sabotage this?

13:57.136 --> 13:58.270
She's making the situation
worse.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.242
It's not perfect!

14:06.312 --> 14:07.513
Oh, dear.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.115
Marcelo, a beaten man.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.416
He's soulless.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.284
If that's expediting,

14:12.318 --> 14:12.419
well, he might as well
still be at home.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.519
well, he might as well
still be at home.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.354
Kata, well,
she can definitely talk,

14:15.388 --> 14:16.622
but she's not doing anything.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.324
Talk, talk, talk, talk,
but nothing being done.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.525
Kitchen's in chaos,

14:19.558 --> 14:21.894
and the restaurant
is  sinking.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.130
It's cold.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.631
I don't want it.
I'm done.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.066
Chef Ramsay has seen enough

14:27.099 --> 14:28.234
of this service.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.368
Customers are unhappy.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.105
And there's chaos
in the kitchen.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.041
So he decides to take
a break from the madness

14:35.074 --> 14:36.909
and check out the food storage.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.545
Look at all this food
in here.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.680
And what he finds

14:40.713 --> 14:42.415
is an outraGeous amount
of food

14:42.448 --> 14:43.816
for a failing restaurant.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.385
How much produce
is in this fridge?

14:46.419 --> 14:49.689
Trays and trays of produce.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.723
Look, and they put

14:50.756 --> 14:51.924
the fresh one
at the front,

14:51.957 --> 14:53.259
and at the back,

14:53.292 --> 14:54.794
you've got the squidgy one.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.230
Marinated skirt.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.765
No, tilapia.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.868
That is what you call
dry chicken.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.937
That's more chicken.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.707
There must be thousands
and thousands of dollars' worth

15:07.740 --> 15:09.575
of food here.

15:09.608 --> 15:12.411
If their cash flow
is in the ,

15:12.445 --> 15:13.846
This...

15:13.879 --> 15:15.915
is a big reason why.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.083
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.217
Have a good night, guys.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.685
After observing dinner service,

15:19.719 --> 15:20.886
Chef Ramsay now knows

15:20.920 --> 15:21.954
that Mojito's problems

15:21.987 --> 15:22.955
are not just confined

15:22.988 --> 15:24.090
to a bad relationship...

15:25.391 --> 15:26.625
and subpar food.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.027
We'll never come here again.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.529
In fact,
Mojito's is in much worse shape

15:30.563 --> 15:33.365
than he thought.

15:33.365 --> 15:34.466
Right, let's start off

15:34.499 --> 15:36.735
with tonight's dinner service.

15:36.768 --> 15:40.539
Or shall I say
a disservice?

15:40.572 --> 15:42.419
Customers pissed off?

15:42.419 --> 15:43.608
Customers pissed off?

15:43.642 --> 15:47.979
Dishes being returned.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.147
If each and every one of you

15:49.181 --> 15:51.316
want this  restaurant
to work,

15:51.349 --> 15:53.151
you all have to reach
for a standard.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.986
Whether you're serving food,

15:55.020 --> 15:56.788
whether you're cooking food,

15:56.822 --> 15:59.825
or whether you're sending food.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.860
At the end of service,

16:01.893 --> 16:04.396
I popped downstairs.

16:04.429 --> 16:07.733
Who does the purchasing
in here?

16:07.766 --> 16:10.235
Who buys the fish,

16:10.268 --> 16:11.470
the meat,

16:11.503 --> 16:12.419
and the vegetables?

16:12.419 --> 16:12.604
and the vegetables?

16:12.637 --> 16:13.905
Me.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.073
Marcelo.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.341
Stay there.

16:16.374 --> 16:17.843
Stay there.
Let me just show you something.

16:20.345 --> 16:21.880
Right now I'm really nervous

16:21.913 --> 16:23.482
because I don't know
what gonna happen.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.452
Take that up for me,
please.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.254
Just bring the whole tray up
for me.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.288
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.023
I don't know what to expect.

16:31.056 --> 16:34.026
I'm scared.

16:35.694 --> 16:36.795
Wow.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.831
Oh, man!

16:44.703 --> 16:48.107
Mojito's is over $300,000
in debt.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.208
I am amazed.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.576
What Chef Ramsay found

16:50.609 --> 16:52.678
in the basements
is one of the reasons why.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.115
Oh, no.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.217
Oh, my God.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.251
I'm not even gonna look.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.858
Thank you.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.059
Okay.

17:09.761 --> 17:10.863
I was speechless.

17:10.896 --> 17:11.434
How can Marcelo

17:11.434 --> 17:12.264
How can Marcelo

17:12.297 --> 17:14.266
allow something
like this to happen?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.136
I've never seen

17:17.169 --> 17:20.272
such waste
in my entire life.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.306
You've got enough food

17:21.340 --> 17:22.975
down there to serve a banquet

17:23.008 --> 17:24.943
of 5,000.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.446
There's seven of these

17:27.479 --> 17:28.447
down there.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.948
Seven.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.517
I don't know
if I'm going

17:31.550 --> 17:34.186
to kill Eduardo first

17:34.219 --> 17:35.454
or I'm gonna kill myself first.

17:35.487 --> 17:40.759
This is rapidly shutting down

17:40.792 --> 17:41.434
the restaurant.

17:41.434 --> 17:42.528
the restaurant.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.662
I've got some work to do.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.731
And I got to get out of here,
guys.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.032
That makes me feel sick.

17:47.065 --> 17:48.066
I'm the owner,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.201
And this is my kitchen.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.469
This is my place.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.804
I should be the one
taking control of the situation.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.310
Chef Ramsay uncovered
many problems

17:58.343 --> 17:59.645
At Mojito's.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.880
But for this restaurant
to ever work properly,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.682
he has to understand
the issues

18:03.715 --> 18:05.551
between Marcelo and Kata.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.719
So he spends the morning
with both of them.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.055
Okay, all I've seen so far

18:10.088 --> 18:11.434
is a bossy, angry
little princess.

18:11.434 --> 18:14.259
is a bossy, angry
little princess.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.328
The restaurant's
suffering on the back

18:16.361 --> 18:17.729
of both of you
constantly hurting each other.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.031
He does it to you,

18:19.064 --> 18:20.999
you do it to him.
and it's so sad.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.001
And it's affecting
everybody else

18:23.035 --> 18:24.836
down the line.
it's embarrassing.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.872
Take me back seven years
when you got married.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.641
We are together
all time.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.811
Everybody say,
"You are the perfect couple."

18:32.844 --> 18:35.380
We decide
to have a baby,

18:35.414 --> 18:36.815
so we started
to do fertilization process.

18:36.848 --> 18:38.116
The IVF.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.751
And nothing happened.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.434
I was putting everything
into it.

18:41.434 --> 18:42.221
I was putting everything
into it.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.222
Mm-hmm.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.557
And I was willing to sacrifice
and to do

18:45.591 --> 18:46.992
and go to the treatment,

18:47.025 --> 18:48.594
but there was no support
from him.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.129
While I was on the treatment
injecting myself,

18:51.163 --> 18:52.965
he was out partying
with friends.

18:52.998 --> 18:53.966
Mm-hmm.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.268
I was being left alone.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.103
That's when I'm like, no,
not happening.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.105
You're not coming home
to met at 7:00 in the morning.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.473
I'm your wife.
Yeah.

19:01.506 --> 19:03.642
So that's when everything
started going wrong.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.677
How did the marriage
break down?

19:05.711 --> 19:06.878
She go to Florida

19:06.912 --> 19:08.380
for one year and a half
in Miami.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.015
Did she meet somebody else
in Miami?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.316
Did she meet another man
in Miami?
Yeah.

19:11.350 --> 19:11.434
I took a trip.

19:11.434 --> 19:12.751
I took a trip.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.987
During the trip, I decided
that I was going to leave him.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.154
"You're not making me happy,

19:16.188 --> 19:17.089
"I'm not making you happy,

19:17.122 --> 19:18.490
go your way,
I'll go my way."

19:18.523 --> 19:20.259
Do you think it's time
that one of you

19:20.292 --> 19:23.395
says good-bye to the business?

19:23.428 --> 19:24.796
And give each other space.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.765
I think
it would be very healthy.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.670
I want Kata off
of this business.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.408
She doesn't do nothing.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.509
How important
is the business for you?

19:37.542 --> 19:38.644
It's everything for me.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.712
The person
that I was married to,

19:40.746 --> 19:41.434
that person doesn't exist
anymore.

19:41.434 --> 19:42.648
that person doesn't exist
anymore.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.649
He's gone.

19:43.682 --> 19:47.219
And I have to move on.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.054
And that's what I'm doing.

19:49.087 --> 19:54.192
And I take the loss
of my marriage,

19:54.226 --> 19:55.594
and I think
that's the price

19:55.627 --> 19:58.497
that I have to pay
for my business.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.732
So I'm taking it
on my business.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.534
Because it's all I have left.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.341
Whatever it takes,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.276
I'll go to the end.

20:11.310 --> 20:11.434
Until I feel there is
nothing else that I can do.

20:11.434 --> 20:14.212
Until I feel there is
nothing else that I can do.

20:16.948 --> 20:18.817
I've got a plan.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.352
I just--I need to see you

20:20.385 --> 20:22.888
like it was 4 1/2, 5 years ago.

20:22.921 --> 20:25.390
You know, funny,

20:25.424 --> 20:26.658
confident,
and no bickering.

20:26.692 --> 20:27.726
I'm committed.

20:27.759 --> 20:28.927
Okay.
Okay.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.362
Thank you.
Come here.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.597
Stand strong.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.032
Thank you.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.434
Marcelo and I,
if we don't find a way

20:41.434 --> 20:41.606
Marcelo and I,
if we don't find a way

20:41.640 --> 20:43.709
to communicate,
if we don't find a way

20:43.742 --> 20:45.977
to get into an agreement,

20:46.011 --> 20:47.212
the restaurant is going
to go down the drain.

20:47.245 --> 20:51.083
But Marcelo
really drives me crazy.

20:51.116 --> 20:53.352
And I don't think
it's gonna work ever.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.292
While Kata and Marcelo have

21:00.325 --> 21:02.527
Both lost their passion
for each other,

21:02.561 --> 21:04.029
Chef Ramsay wants to know
if they still have

21:04.062 --> 21:05.497
their passion for the food.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.733
One thing I haven't seen
since I've been here

21:07.766 --> 21:09.801
is you two working together.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.069
So that's exactly
what we're gonna do now.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.042
With all these ingredients
in front of you,

21:17.075 --> 21:20.979
Cook me something authentic,
something Cuban.

21:21.012 --> 21:22.581
And do it together.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.583
Oh, gosh,
are we gonna be able to do this?

21:24.616 --> 21:25.917
Hey, no arguing.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.018
Yes?

21:27.052 --> 21:29.121
we can't be together
at the kitchen.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.493
Oh, okay.

21:34.526 --> 21:35.594
I'll make the shrimp

21:35.627 --> 21:37.062
with pineapple sauce.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.332
Okay, let me do
the fricassee.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.434
Marcelo wanted to make chicken,
but I wanted to do my shrimp.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.534
Marcelo wanted to make chicken,
but I wanted to do my shrimp.

21:42.567 --> 21:47.205
So we started cooking two dishes
instead of one.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.740
Very quiet in here.

21:48.774 --> 21:49.941
Everybody okay?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.443
Everything good.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.544
Everything's good.
Is this dish done together?

21:52.577 --> 21:54.045
We're doing two dishes.

21:54.079 --> 21:55.213
No.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.549
I want to see you two moppets

21:57.582 --> 21:59.418
work together.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.519
One dish.

22:00.552 --> 22:01.753
Oh, my God.

22:01.787 --> 22:04.222
That's not gonna happen.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.957
Okay, okay, okay,
don't fret.

22:05.991 --> 22:06.958
Just keep moving.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.026
One dish?

22:08.059 --> 22:09.561
Two.

22:09.594 --> 22:10.829
50/50.

22:10.862 --> 22:11.434
Oh.
Unbelievable.

22:11.434 --> 22:12.898
Oh.
Unbelievable.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.766
Okay.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.403
Chicken with potatoes.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.937
Whose idea was it
to do the shrimp?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.105
Who was it?
Me.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.706
Mm-hmm.
Simple flavors.

22:24.075 --> 22:26.845
I think I did
a much better job than Marcelo.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.179
Mm, I like that.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.314
Nice.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.116
That's nice.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.184
What is that?
Chicken fricassee.

22:33.218 --> 22:34.853
Presentation, it's not
as attractive as the shrimp.

22:34.886 --> 22:35.887
Clearly.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.259
Not blow me away.

22:41.292 --> 22:41.434
It's mediocre.

22:41.434 --> 22:42.761
It's mediocre.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.095
The shrimp is the dish

22:44.129 --> 22:47.298
I'd love to pay for
in a local Cuban restaurant.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.000
We'll do that
as a special

22:49.033 --> 22:51.369
tonight, yes?

22:51.403 --> 22:52.704
It makes me feel wonderful

22:52.737 --> 22:53.738
that my dish has been chosen

22:53.772 --> 22:55.039
for one of the specials

22:55.073 --> 22:56.908
by Chef Ramsay.
an honor.

22:56.941 --> 22:58.109
Okay, good.

22:58.143 --> 22:59.277
Now do me one more favor.

22:59.310 --> 23:00.478
off out together

23:00.512 --> 23:01.746
through the doors.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.847
See if you can just
manage walking out together.

23:09.587 --> 23:10.555
Hell.

23:10.588 --> 23:11.434
While Chef Ramsay works

23:11.434 --> 23:11.890
While Chef Ramsay works

23:11.923 --> 23:13.658
On another special
with Chef Eduardo...

23:13.691 --> 23:15.093
Come on, let's do
something together, yes?

23:15.126 --> 23:16.327
Something special
is also happening

23:16.361 --> 23:17.562
Out in the dining room.

23:17.595 --> 23:18.730
Marcelo.

23:18.763 --> 23:19.731
Kata and Marcelo

23:19.764 --> 23:20.799
Are communicating.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.000
I wanted to ask you

23:22.033 --> 23:23.401
if you want to switch tonight.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.402
I'll be in the kitchen,

23:24.436 --> 23:25.537
you wanna be here?

23:25.570 --> 23:27.138
You come out here,
you stay out front,

23:27.172 --> 23:28.907
you just, like,
follow the lead.

23:36.614 --> 23:38.817
The people in the kitchen...

23:38.850 --> 23:39.884
gonna run out.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.434
With her attitude,

23:41.434 --> 23:41.686
With her attitude,

23:41.719 --> 23:44.055
with her.

23:44.088 --> 23:46.257
She's a nightmare.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.460
Coming up

23:48.493 --> 23:50.094
On Kitchen Nightmares...

23:50.128 --> 23:51.729
I'm the boss here.
Remember who I am.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.431
Kata's on the warpath
in the kitchen.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.400
If I want to scream,
I can do it.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.801
And nothing...

23:56.835 --> 23:58.036
He's standing there
doing nothing!

23:58.069 --> 23:59.070
Or nobody...

23:59.103 --> 24:00.138
I'll do it myself.

24:00.171 --> 24:01.139
Will get in her way.

24:01.172 --> 24:02.407
You have to listen to me.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.875
Everything is a disaster.

24:03.908 --> 24:05.577
And the dining room

24:05.610 --> 24:07.479
Led by Marcelo
is a circus.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.013
Don't bounce around
like a monkey.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.048
Will the soap opera

24:10.081 --> 24:11.434
Have a happy ending,

24:11.434 --> 24:11.616
Have a happy ending,

24:11.649 --> 24:13.218
or will Mojito's go up
in flames?

24:13.251 --> 24:14.919
Marcelo, get out
of the kitchen.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.055
Get out
of the kitchen.

24:17.088 --> 24:20.658
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

24:25.931 --> 24:29.101
Chef Ramsay's plan
for tonight's dinner service

24:29.134 --> 24:30.402
features his garlic chicken

24:30.435 --> 24:31.837
and Kata's shrimp
with mango salsa.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.505
Tonight's going to be
a lot better

24:33.539 --> 24:34.773
than we had last night,
yes?

24:34.806 --> 24:35.807
Yes.

24:35.841 --> 24:36.808
But Kata has a plan

24:36.842 --> 24:38.443
Of her own.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.078
Chef Ramsay,
we're gonna be switching places.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.114
Marcelo and I.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.649
I'm gonna be in the kitchen
starting.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.551
He's gonna be front house.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.956
I mean,
that sounds great.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.157
Who came to that decision?

24:52.191 --> 24:52.394
We both did, yes.

24:52.394 --> 24:53.225
We both did, yes.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.293
Whoo.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.094
Round of applause.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.796
That's amazing.
Wow.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.999
Uh?
Everybody's happy.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.669
So I want fast, efficient
service,

25:03.702 --> 25:04.836
hot  food,

25:04.870 --> 25:06.104
and, more importantly,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.073
you got to show me
that you can handle

25:08.106 --> 25:09.641
small changes.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.976
Expedite, host,

25:11.009 --> 25:12.311
serve, cook.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.313
Let's go, yeah?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.519
Hey, how are you?
Good, how are you?

25:20.552 --> 25:22.054
Welcome to Mojito.
Thank you.

25:25.557 --> 25:26.758
I'm definitely really nervous

25:26.792 --> 25:28.026
about tonight's dinner service.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.996
I don't think Marcelo does well

25:31.029 --> 25:33.198
in the front of the house.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.766
Okay, don't bounce around
like a monkey, yeah?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.735
Walk in the  dining room.

25:36.768 --> 25:39.037
As patrons
enter the restaurant...

25:39.071 --> 25:41.607
Welcome to Mojito.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.041
Kata takes the helm
in the kitchen.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.344
While you work for me,
I'm your boss.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.779
So you're here and fryer.
This is your section.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.548
I can definitely handle pressure

25:49.581 --> 25:50.682
in the back of the house.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.394
It needs more chicken
than vegetables.

25:52.394 --> 25:52.918
It needs more chicken
than vegetables.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.254
And I know I'm gonna do much
better work than Marcello.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.288
How you doing, guys?

25:56.321 --> 25:58.090
We have a couple
of specials tonight.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.792
It's a lemon and garlic
garden chicken.

26:00.826 --> 26:04.062
We also have
two jumbo grilled shrimp

26:04.096 --> 26:05.597
with tropical salsa.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.533
You want
the chicken special?

26:08.567 --> 26:09.668
Thank you so much.

26:09.701 --> 26:10.702
Here we go, guys.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.404
First order, yes?

26:12.437 --> 26:14.640
Guacamole and cheese.
Beef empanadas.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.642
And then we're gonna have
a garlic chicken.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.313
I'll tell you
when to throw it to Roscoe.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.394
And one order of empanadas,
one chicken, one beef.

26:22.394 --> 26:24.216
And one order of empanadas,
one chicken, one beef.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.185
Let me have an order of
jumbo shrimp and one guacamole.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.720
Pick up,
two chicken specials!

26:28.754 --> 26:30.522
Thank you, team.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.391
Another order
of the jumbo shrimp special.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.825
Tonight's dinner service is off

26:33.859 --> 26:36.228
to a good start.
Good.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.963
Kata has control of the kitchen.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.464
One chicken.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.466
And customers are enjoying
the specials.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.469
Very good.

26:44.503 --> 26:45.470
I don't know why,

26:45.504 --> 26:46.805
but it feels better tonight.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.040
Way better.
Why?

26:48.073 --> 26:50.042
Katalina is awesome
in the kitchen.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.410
Two guacamole and chips.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.394
One tropical shrimp.

26:52.394 --> 26:52.978
One tropical shrimp.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.780
Marcelo is actually better
in the front

26:54.813 --> 26:56.181
'cause it's less stress
on him.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.949
Senor, thank you so much.
Good luck.

26:57.983 --> 26:58.950
So he's better in the front,

26:58.984 --> 27:00.018
She's better in the kitchen.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.086
Yeah, I believe so.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.888
Three more chickens in total.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.890
You look so good and composed
back here.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.024
That's how you do it.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.025
Hello.
Holler back, baby.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.026
Holler back.
Thank you, baby.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.530
This restaurant
is still chaotic,

27:11.563 --> 27:13.765
but there's a massive,
significant difference.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.434
Kata can handle pressure
a thousand times better

27:15.467 --> 27:17.102
than Marcelo,
and the good news

27:17.135 --> 27:19.004
is the specials are flying out.

27:19.037 --> 27:22.174
While the new specials
are a big hit with the diners...

27:22.207 --> 27:22.394
Really good.

27:22.394 --> 27:23.275
Really good.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.509
The original menu

27:24.543 --> 27:25.977
Is striking out.
I have to get something else.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.247
Coming up.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.916
What's wrong?

27:30.949 --> 27:34.086
He didn't like the--
he says it has a strange taste.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.588
Strange taste.
Yes.

27:36.621 --> 27:37.723
Okay, let's go, guys.
Pick up.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.891
Kata, this steak was
strange taste.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.827
- Can I have a  instead?
-  Yes.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.995
It's on the window.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.832
Keep it respectful.
Remember who I am.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.436
I'm the boss, like it or not.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.394
You have to listen
to me.

27:52.394 --> 27:52.637
You have to listen
to me.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.840
You're waiting
for your sides still, right?

27:54.873 --> 27:55.874
Yes, he's getting it.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.911
Well, let me have the ticket.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.313
What's the mess
with the ticket?

28:01.346 --> 28:03.448
I'm feeling
a lot of pressure.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.117
There's lost tickets.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.551
There's food coming out wrong.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.854
Everything is a disaster.

28:08.887 --> 28:09.988
And Chef Ramsay is watching us.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.857
I need a container
for the tickets.

28:11.890 --> 28:12.858
Ice buckets.

28:12.891 --> 28:13.959
I need
a spike in the kitchen.

28:13.992 --> 28:14.993
We're losing  tickets.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.231
My God, those sandwiches
are not ready yet?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.394
When we get busy,
Kata loses herself.

28:22.394 --> 28:23.535
When we get busy,
Kata loses herself.

28:23.568 --> 28:24.736
She becomes very confused.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.705
We have one
of the tropical shrimp.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.074
Everything went out?

28:29.107 --> 28:30.642
She doesn't know
what really's going on.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.677
Wait, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.879
It's chaos.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.423
It's an hour and a half

28:45.456 --> 28:46.624
into dinner service,

28:46.657 --> 28:49.494
and the restaurant
is in utter turmoil.

28:49.527 --> 28:50.561
There are lost orders...

28:50.595 --> 28:51.963
I need a spike
in the kitchen

28:51.996 --> 28:53.131
'cause we're losing tickets.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.366
Unhappy customers,

28:55.399 --> 28:57.735
And Kata is spinning
out of control.

28:57.768 --> 28:59.337
Wait, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.838
Mojito's is on the rocks

29:00.872 --> 29:02.006
once again.

29:02.039 --> 29:03.441
That's getting cold.

29:03.474 --> 29:04.709
We cannot have any more food
waiting for one order.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.944
Kata, you put in one order
for one ticket like this.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.179
No!

29:08.212 --> 29:09.413
Five minutes later.

29:09.447 --> 29:10.385
,
five minutes later.

29:10.385 --> 29:10.948
,
five minutes later.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.216
Marcelo,
get out of the kitchen.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.252
Get out of the kitchen.

29:14.285 --> 29:15.586
She become like a tiger.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.321
"Get out of my kitchen!

29:17.355 --> 29:18.689
Hey, go out!"

29:18.723 --> 29:19.790
Out of the kitchen. Okay,
now, get out of the kitchen.

29:19.824 --> 29:20.958
Thank you, Marcelo.

29:20.992 --> 29:23.427
What's--what's wrong
with this girl?

29:23.461 --> 29:24.428
She's crazy.

29:24.462 --> 29:25.997
That's perfect.
Thank you.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.732
That doesn't leave there,
yeah?

29:27.765 --> 29:29.500
The kitchen is getting behind.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.903
Everything is not coming out
right.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.004
Everything's going wrong.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.438
I have to, like, take control

29:34.472 --> 29:36.073
and do something,
take some action.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.375
All right, guys.

29:37.408 --> 29:38.943
This order,
we have to make it perfect.

29:38.976 --> 29:40.178
Perfect.

29:40.211 --> 29:40.385
Yeah, here we go, yeah?

29:40.385 --> 29:41.879
Yeah, here we go, yeah?

29:41.913 --> 29:43.514
Okay, so you need
two churrasco medium,

29:43.548 --> 29:45.216
two garden chicken,

29:45.249 --> 29:46.617
one pescado marinero,

29:46.651 --> 29:47.852
one milanesa breaded.

29:47.885 --> 29:49.687
Kata.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.389
Is the chicken coming?

29:52.523 --> 29:53.724
B1.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.126
After a good start,

29:55.159 --> 29:57.094
A miserable middle,

29:57.128 --> 29:58.529
Kata pushes for a strong finish.

30:02.066 --> 30:05.069
Kata seems
to be doing better.

30:05.102 --> 30:06.204
Two chickens, yes.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.105
Nice.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.174
Now she's got a better grip
on tickets, on expediting.

30:10.208 --> 30:10.385
Take that chicken.

30:10.385 --> 30:11.976
Take that chicken.

30:12.009 --> 30:13.044
Go team!

30:13.077 --> 30:14.245
Go team!

30:14.278 --> 30:15.880
Brilliant.
Well done.

30:15.913 --> 30:18.616
Tonight was so much better
than last night.

30:18.649 --> 30:19.650
A lot smoother.

30:19.684 --> 30:20.885
Take care.

30:20.918 --> 30:22.019
Good night.

30:24.522 --> 30:25.790
After an up-and-down service,

30:25.823 --> 30:27.625
Chef Ramsay knows
that for Mojito's to reach

30:27.658 --> 30:28.960
its potential...

30:28.993 --> 30:30.228
That is beautiful.

30:30.261 --> 30:32.129
Kata and Marcelo
have to be

30:32.163 --> 30:33.931
On the same page.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.666
Okay, first of all,
tonight was better.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.901
But, let me tell you,

30:36.934 --> 30:38.369
we can't just get by

30:38.402 --> 30:40.385
on two specials.

30:40.385 --> 30:40.471
on two specials.

30:40.504 --> 30:41.973
We need
to be consistent.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.909
So it was
a small step forward.

30:44.942 --> 30:46.010
Now we have to take

30:46.043 --> 30:48.179
a giant leap forward.

30:48.212 --> 30:50.248
That will be done tomorrow.

30:50.281 --> 30:54.218
We're gonna relaunch
this restaurant...

30:54.252 --> 30:55.653
I'm gonna be working
on the menu

30:55.686 --> 30:57.755
throughout the whole night.

30:57.788 --> 31:01.459
But before I leave you here,

31:01.492 --> 31:03.794
I'm gonna ask you
a very serious question.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.564
And I spent
a lot of time with both of you,

31:06.597 --> 31:09.100
and I totally accept

31:09.133 --> 31:10.385
that the possibility
of a husband-and-wife scenario

31:10.385 --> 31:12.536
that the possibility
of a husband-and-wife scenario

31:12.570 --> 31:13.838
is not on the cards.

31:13.871 --> 31:16.173
That is not gonna happen.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.109
But you both own the place.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.544
And what I need to know
from both of you

31:20.578 --> 31:25.049
is that are you prepared
to put the grievances,

31:25.082 --> 31:26.951
your egos,

31:26.984 --> 31:28.185
your frustrations,

31:28.219 --> 31:30.288
your anger aside,

31:30.321 --> 31:33.257
and completely focus
on your baby,

31:33.291 --> 31:35.159
and that
is the Mojito restaurant.

31:35.192 --> 31:37.161
'Cause if you can do that,

31:37.194 --> 31:39.230
you've got a strong possibility

31:39.263 --> 31:40.385
of making
this place work.

31:40.385 --> 31:40.464
of making
this place work.

31:40.498 --> 31:41.966
If you can't,

31:41.999 --> 31:44.769
then we have
a big,  problem.

31:47.138 --> 31:49.006
Good night.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.147
It's up to us.

32:10.528 --> 32:14.098
I hope in my heart

32:14.131 --> 32:15.733
Kata and me can work together.

32:18.002 --> 32:20.271
With the belief
that Kata and Marcelo

32:20.304 --> 32:21.906
Are committed
to working together,

32:21.939 --> 32:23.874
Chef Ramsay and his team
spend the night

32:23.908 --> 32:27.745
giving Mojito's
a much-needed makeover.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.917
Good morning.
Welcome to Mojito's.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.318
Wow.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.886
The new Mojito's, yes?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.922
Doesn't it feel
twice as big?

32:37.955 --> 32:39.457
Hello, Cuba.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.385
This looks amazing.

32:40.385 --> 32:40.825
This looks amazing.

32:43.027 --> 32:43.994
Blocking out
all that natural light

32:44.028 --> 32:45.229
Was crazy.

32:45.262 --> 32:48.366
Look how bright this place is.
And it's fresh.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.433
Open air.
Open.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.468
First thing
that's gone missing

32:50.501 --> 32:52.803
are the 500 bottles

32:52.837 --> 32:55.339
that were stopping
all that natural light.

32:55.373 --> 32:56.640
Oh, that's beautiful.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.008
Take a look

32:58.042 --> 32:59.477
At where your bottles
have gone.

33:01.245 --> 33:05.015
No more blue rinse cleaner.

33:11.655 --> 33:12.623
Kata, what do you think?

33:12.656 --> 33:14.024
This is amazing.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.659
This is a huge step

33:15.693 --> 33:16.861
of moving forward.

33:16.894 --> 33:19.029
And this has, like,
inspired us

33:19.063 --> 33:20.398
and, like, give everyone

33:20.431 --> 33:21.632
this part
that we were missing

33:21.665 --> 33:23.434
to keep going

33:23.467 --> 33:24.635
and keep working hard.

33:24.668 --> 33:26.270
Great restaurant.
Yes?

33:26.303 --> 33:29.740
Yes.
Now you need a proper menu.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.442
Wow.

33:31.475 --> 33:32.910
Marco.

33:32.943 --> 33:34.578
The menu's been cut
in half.

33:34.612 --> 33:35.713
Why?
We need speed.

33:35.746 --> 33:36.847
Yes.

33:36.881 --> 33:38.516
Thanks, God.

33:38.549 --> 33:39.683
We keep it small.

33:39.717 --> 33:40.385
We keep it fresh.
Yes.

33:40.385 --> 33:40.918
We keep it fresh.
Yes.

33:40.951 --> 33:42.253
And more importantly,

33:42.286 --> 33:43.521
We no longer need

33:43.554 --> 33:47.992
to keep 10,000-worth
of ingredients downstairs

33:48.025 --> 33:49.527
that's not been turned,
yes?

33:49.560 --> 33:50.628
Yes.

33:50.661 --> 33:53.097
You happy?
Extremely.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.131
Yeah?

33:54.165 --> 33:55.232
Good.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.367
Unbelievable.

33:56.400 --> 34:00.471
When I see Kata crying
like a baby,

34:00.504 --> 34:03.541
I really feel
really happy for her.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.543
I'm so happy too.

34:05.576 --> 34:08.412
So, so, so, so, so,
so happy.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.680
Today is the beginning

34:09.681 --> 34:10.385
of a new chapter
inside Mojito's.

34:10.385 --> 34:11.883
of a new chapter
inside Mojito's.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.318
Thank you so much.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.953
Come here.
Thank you.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.390
Hey.
This is the best.

34:18.423 --> 34:20.158
Yes?
This is the best.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.962
With the renovation done

34:23.995 --> 34:26.531
And Marcelo and Kata's
relationship on the mend,

34:26.564 --> 34:29.534
Chef Ramsay has done away
with the cafeteria-style food,

34:29.567 --> 34:32.570
and in its place,
contemporary Cuban cuisine.

34:32.604 --> 34:36.107
Look at the difference
in the portion size first.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.409
--Meatballs,

34:37.442 --> 34:40.111
Entrees--slow-roast pork,
braised short ribs,

34:40.145 --> 34:40.385
authentic and sumptuous.

34:40.385 --> 34:41.946
authentic and sumptuous.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.449
It's a lot less, but, visually,
it's beautiful.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.751
From the new menu,

34:46.785 --> 34:49.020
I find
a lot of exciting new things.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.523
Wow. Meatballs.
Wow.

34:51.556 --> 34:52.724
I'm so excited.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.026
I'm really looking forward
for tonight.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.763
For relaunch night,

34:58.797 --> 35:01.032
With Chef Ramsay's blessing,

35:01.066 --> 35:03.034
Kata and Marcelo decide
to work the front of the house

35:03.068 --> 35:04.702
greeting customers,

35:04.736 --> 35:06.538
leaving Chef Eduardo
in charge of the kitchen.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.073
Are you convinced
you can do it?
Yeah.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.385
Hey, Marcelo.
Two seconds.

35:10.385 --> 35:12.844
Hey, Marcelo.
Two seconds.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.979
I've managed to get

35:15.013 --> 35:16.081
a really amazing VIP guest here
this evening.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.449
He's a president

35:17.482 --> 35:19.918
of the Brooklyn Borough.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.886
Okay, so look after him,
yeah?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.121
Thank you.
We will.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.589
Everything's on the line
tonight.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.357
Marcelo and I have
to come together.

35:26.391 --> 35:27.692
Otherwise,
we're gonna fail.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.296
Welcome to Mojito.

35:31.329 --> 35:32.697
How many are you guys?

35:32.730 --> 35:34.032
Four.
Follow me this way, guys.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.403
Are you guys ready?

35:38.436 --> 35:39.537
Cuban sandwich, okay.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.385
For the first time

35:40.385 --> 35:40.772
For the first time

35:40.805 --> 35:42.006
In five years,

35:42.040 --> 35:43.041
Brooklyn's only Cuban restaurant

35:43.074 --> 35:44.042
clearly has a buzz

35:44.075 --> 35:45.143
in the dining room.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.611
Awesome.
Thank you, gentlemen, so much.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.546
And as for the kitchen,

35:48.580 --> 35:50.181
It's a different story.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.620
It's very quiet here, guys.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.455
Eddie, two orders on.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.491
Yeah, nothing called out.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.092
You're not gonna call
the orders out to the team?

36:01.126 --> 36:02.827
Those tickets come in,

36:02.861 --> 36:04.129
you got to be in control,
big boy.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.196
Yes, Chef.
Good man.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.332
Your food should be out
any minute.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.466
Okay?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.901
Pick up.

36:09.934 --> 36:10.385
with Chef Eduardo's lack

36:10.385 --> 36:11.369
with Chef Eduardo's lack

36:11.402 --> 36:12.403
of communication,

36:12.437 --> 36:14.172
food is leaving
the kitchen slowly.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.173
Be right back with the beans.

36:15.206 --> 36:17.008
And when it does arrive

36:17.041 --> 36:19.344
In the dining room...

36:19.377 --> 36:21.479
Some customers receive dishes

36:21.513 --> 36:22.714
They didn't even order.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.415
You had a Cuban sandwich?
Yeah.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.117
Guys.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.318
What?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.820
F5 is missing a Cuban.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.824
What came back?

36:32.857 --> 36:33.925
This plate because they order
a Cuban sandwich.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.160
Not the pork?
Not the pork.

36:36.394 --> 36:37.562
Look at me now.

36:37.595 --> 36:38.897
You've got to call out
the  orders

36:38.930 --> 36:40.265
'cause he's cooking blind.

36:40.298 --> 36:40.385
Okay. Okay.

36:40.385 --> 36:41.633
Okay. Okay.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.835
Yeah, so he needs some form
of direction, yeah?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.537
And don't forget to send beans

36:45.570 --> 36:47.639
out with every order.

36:47.672 --> 36:49.407
Oh,.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.442
Restaurant's full,
great atmosphere.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.178
Unfortunately, food started
coming back,

36:53.211 --> 36:55.046
and Eduardo
has  shut down.

36:55.079 --> 36:58.550
Not tonight, because this could
be a  disaster.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.986
Yeah.
Well, we did order six.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.055
But they're all chicken.

37:11.496 --> 37:14.599
I see tickets coming back

37:14.632 --> 37:17.001
Because Eduardo
was completely lost.

37:17.035 --> 37:20.338
Hey, guys, F4 is missing
more empanadas.

37:20.371 --> 37:22.907
They had one of each.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.142
Come on, man.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.777
Hey.

37:25.810 --> 37:26.811
Welcome to Mojito.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.079
Thank you.

37:28.112 --> 37:29.180
Enjoy the food.

37:29.214 --> 37:30.248
This is the table
especially for you, okay?

37:30.281 --> 37:31.816
This one here?
Yes.

37:31.849 --> 37:34.152
The president
of the Borough is here,

37:34.185 --> 37:37.055
And the kitchen
is a disaster.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.385
Completely disaster.

37:40.385 --> 37:41.092
Completely disaster.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.727
What is this?
So we can start taking it.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.229
What table?

37:44.262 --> 37:46.130
This steak's cold
as well.

37:46.164 --> 37:48.533
The President of the Borough
is here.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.001
Eddie's not expediting,

37:50.034 --> 37:51.369
he's not talking,
he's not communicating.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.271
If Eddie doesn't start
to speak up,

37:53.304 --> 37:56.074
this kitchen's gonna go down.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.542
Give me a break.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.550
It's relaunch night,

38:06.584 --> 38:08.753
And the President of the
Brooklyn Borough has arrived.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.155
Welcome to Mojito.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.189
And the timing

38:12.223 --> 38:13.190
Couldn't be worse.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.659
Eduardo is a mess,

38:14.692 --> 38:16.994
and Chef Ramsay knows
he has to step in.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.162
Turn those steaks over.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.263
Two seconds with me.
Two seconds.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.099
Literally two seconds.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.801
Come on.
What's the matter?

38:23.834 --> 38:26.404
Huh?
What's the matter?

38:26.437 --> 38:27.772
I know you're
all over the place.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.674
But what you're not doing
for you,

38:29.707 --> 38:30.942
for me,
for the restaurant,

38:30.975 --> 38:31.412
no one's talking.

38:31.412 --> 38:32.610
no one's talking.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.015
Because I--
Do something.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.451
Okay, come on, Eddie.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.986
Man, talk.
Yes, Chef.

38:42.019 --> 38:43.754
Just do something,
but talk.

38:43.788 --> 38:45.456
Come on.
Yes, Chef. Okay.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.457
You can do it.
Come on.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.959
Come here.
Cuba, come here.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.193
The President of the Borough

38:49.226 --> 38:52.296
is here, and the kitchen
is a nightmare right now.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.497
I have to do something,

38:53.531 --> 38:54.732
and I have to do it now.

38:54.765 --> 38:55.833
Here we go, here we go.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.235
Let's go.
Let's expedite this.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.236
We concentrating now.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.412
Pescado marinero,
ropa vieja,

39:01.412 --> 39:01.439
Pescado marinero,
ropa vieja,

39:01.472 --> 39:02.740
arroz con pollo,
white meat only,

39:02.773 --> 39:04.976
churrasco pork,
okay?

39:05.009 --> 39:06.777
Nice.
Here we go.

39:06.811 --> 39:08.779
Guys, this is the most important
order of the night.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.114
That's one guy we cannot afford
to piss off tonight.

39:10.147 --> 39:12.416
Exactly.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.551
Arroz con pollo!

39:16.887 --> 39:18.856
Fish.

39:18.889 --> 39:19.957
Excellent.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.058
L'arroz.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.194
I need another.

39:23.227 --> 39:24.195
Beautiful, beautiful.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.563
Guys, we need
more plantains.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.864
Do we have more?

39:26.897 --> 39:27.865
It's coming in five.
Give me five.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.467
Give me five.
Thank you.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.501
Brilliant.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.412
Thank you.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.570
Thank you.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.272
Kata and me
are working together well again.

39:35.306 --> 39:37.541
I gonna do this,
and you do that.

39:37.575 --> 39:38.743
Let's go.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.478
With Kata and Marcelo

39:40.511 --> 39:41.512
Finally working together
as a team...

39:41.545 --> 39:42.880
All right.

39:42.913 --> 39:44.215
The kitchen is back on track.

39:44.248 --> 39:46.350
This is B3?
B3.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.986
And now the only thing left

39:49.020 --> 39:50.955
to make the night
a success is satisfying

39:50.988 --> 39:52.356
the Borough president.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.058
How is everything here?
Delicious.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.059
They loved everything.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.560
Yeah, baby.
Yeah.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.064
Marcelo took control
of the whole situation.

40:00.097 --> 40:01.412
He was very put together,
very calm.

40:01.412 --> 40:01.632
He was very put together,
very calm.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.200
Very relaxed.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.602
He really got things going,

40:04.635 --> 40:07.905
and that make me gain
more respect for him.

40:07.938 --> 40:09.940
Well, it means a lot for us
for you guys to be here.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.442
And I appreciate it.
Thank you.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.510
Nice to see you.
Best wishes.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.911
Thank you.

40:13.944 --> 40:15.212
That's it?
That's it.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.614
I think
that the passion is back.

40:18.749 --> 40:19.917
Thank you.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.085
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.287
Have a good night.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.688
Kata and Marcelo

40:24.722 --> 40:27.124
Came together
like the team they once were.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.627
And Mojito's relaunch
was a success.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.412
Right, tonight wasn't perfect,

40:31.412 --> 40:31.729
Right, tonight wasn't perfect,

40:31.762 --> 40:33.030
but I did see one thing,

40:33.064 --> 40:34.498
that I haven't witnessed

40:34.532 --> 40:36.300
at Mojito's for the first time,

40:36.333 --> 40:37.301
and that was teamwork.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.536
Well done.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.971
What do you think
about the future

40:41.005 --> 40:42.339
of this restaurant now?

40:42.373 --> 40:44.141
Before,
it was really uncertain.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.477
We didn't know if we were going
to last a month,

40:46.510 --> 40:48.012
a week, a day.

40:48.045 --> 40:50.081
Now we have a long-term future.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.217
It's up to both of you.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.785
Are you seriously willing

40:54.819 --> 40:56.854
to put your past aside

40:56.887 --> 40:58.789
and commit to your baby?

41:08.032 --> 41:10.101
It feels great
to see Marcelo smile.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.703
Him showing his emotions,

41:12.736 --> 41:16.540
it just, sort of,
right in my heart.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.709
Do me a favor.

41:18.742 --> 41:21.145
Tell each other
how important it is.

41:21.178 --> 41:22.813
You are my partner.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.049
And I need your support,
and I need your commitment.

41:25.082 --> 41:26.584
So if you committed to me,

41:26.617 --> 41:30.588
I'll be 110, 120, 200
committed to you,

41:30.621 --> 41:31.412
to make it work
and to the restaurant.

41:31.412 --> 41:32.189
to make it work
and to the restaurant.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.125
I-I need you

41:34.158 --> 41:35.926
to continue.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.063
You are the half
of that.

41:39.096 --> 41:40.764
I'm gonna do everything
that it takes

41:40.798 --> 41:41.932
to make it work.

41:41.966 --> 41:44.468
You guys work well together.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.237
Tonight proved that.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.839
I feel in my heart

41:48.873 --> 41:51.242
that I get Kata back,

41:51.275 --> 41:53.911
I get my partner back.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.146
Don't stop.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.714
You'd be mad to.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.516
Come here,
my darling.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.217
Ay-yi-yi.
Thank you.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.412
Good to see you guys.

42:01.412 --> 42:01.919
Good to see you guys.

42:01.952 --> 42:03.387
Great scene.

42:07.591 --> 42:08.993
What a night.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.127
When I first arrived,

42:10.161 --> 42:11.462
I honestly didn't think
it was possible

42:11.495 --> 42:13.664
that Kata and Marcelo
could actually work together,

42:13.697 --> 42:15.499
but tonight
they proved me wrong.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.701
Now I'm wondering

42:17.735 --> 42:19.870
if the restaurant that actually
ruined the marriage

42:19.904 --> 42:23.274
could now be the restaurant
that saves their marriage.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.843
me,
only time will tell.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.311
You live in hope.

42:27.344 --> 42:30.681
Get me a strong mojito.

42:33.117 --> 42:34.985
After Gordon's departure,

42:35.019 --> 42:36.921
Marcelo and Kata
were determined

42:36.954 --> 42:38.255
to follow his advice.

42:38.289 --> 42:39.290
We need to work
as a team.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.825
We need to be able
to pay all this.

42:41.859 --> 42:43.561
Thanks to Gordon's smaller menu,

42:43.594 --> 42:44.895
Marcelo buys less produce,

42:44.929 --> 42:47.198
saving nearly $10,000
a month.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.667
And he and Kata
wasted no time

42:49.700 --> 42:51.335
promoting the new Mojito's.

42:51.368 --> 42:53.437
We want to invite everyone
to come and shake it up

42:53.470 --> 42:55.439
at Mojito's.

42:55.472 --> 42:57.575
They got the word out
to the community

42:57.608 --> 42:59.043
By using the popular
Brooklyn flea market,

42:59.076 --> 43:00.511
winning rave reviews...

43:00.544 --> 43:01.412
It's really good.
Good?

43:01.412 --> 43:02.213
It's really good.
Good?

43:02.246 --> 43:03.714
Yeah.
And I can taste
the spices in there.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.249
It's very rich.

43:05.282 --> 43:06.483
More importantly,
Marcelo and Kata

43:06.517 --> 43:09.622
are fighting less
and laughing more.
