WEBVTT

00:08.408 --> 00:10.808
Cold, patronizing, arrogant...

00:10.877 --> 00:11.969
l know she can be difficult.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.568
"Difficult"?
She's impossible.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.307
l'm getting tired
of playing referee

00:15.382 --> 00:17.213
every time you two
have a disagreement.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.342
lf you have a problem,
talk to her yourself.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.216
Does the word"irrelevant"
mean anything to you?

00:21.287 --> 00:22.515
She won't listen.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.318
She may look human,
she may sound human,

00:24.391 --> 00:25.619
but she's all Borg.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.489
Part of the problem
is your attitude.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.549
You've never tried

00:28.628 --> 00:30.493
to accept Seven
as part of the crew.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.552
And with good reason.

00:31.631 --> 00:32.825
Guess what she did this morning.

00:32.899 --> 00:33.991
She took an isolinear processor

00:34.100 --> 00:35.465
out of Engineering
without asking,

00:35.535 --> 00:37.560
and when l went to Astrometrics
to get it back,

00:37.637 --> 00:39.764
she had locked the door--
like that lab

00:39.839 --> 00:41.329
is her own private domain.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.568
What do you want me to do?

00:42.642 --> 00:44.940
Throw her in the brig
for the rest of the trip home?

00:45.011 --> 00:46.706
l've heard worse ideas.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.941
Seven of Nine to Chakotay.

00:49.015 --> 00:49.982
Chakotay here.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.280
Report to the Astrometrics Lab
at once.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.785
On my way.

00:53.853 --> 00:54.785
Did you hear that?

00:54.854 --> 00:55.946
She's giving orders now.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.219
l'm telling you, Chakotay,
if she gets in my way again,

00:59.292 --> 01:01.226
l am not responsible
for what happens.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.525
You're a senior officer
on this ship.

01:04.596 --> 01:05.689
Act like one.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.289
Find a way to deal with her.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.705
Astrometrics?

01:15.775 --> 01:16.707
l've been summoned.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.141
Any guesses what this is about?

01:18.211 --> 01:19.508
None.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.646
Your call sounded urgent.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.911
lt was.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.475
l've been working
to increase the range

01:27.554 --> 01:28.987
of the astrometric sensors

01:29.055 --> 01:29.987
and l've detected something

01:30.056 --> 01:31.648
that you should find
of particular interest.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.123
A ship.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.490
What's special about it?

01:34.561 --> 01:37.394
l've analyzed
the warp signature.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.557
lt's a Starfleet vessel.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.219 --> 03:41.119
The ship we're seeing is
in the Alpha Quadrant.

03:41.187 --> 03:42.279
You couldn't have extended

03:42.355 --> 03:43.845
the astrometric sensors
that far.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.618
No, but l increased
the range far enough

03:45.692 --> 03:47.956
to detect a large network
of relay stations.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.358
They are alien in origin,

03:49.429 --> 03:50.987
abandoned,
but still functioning.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.895
By establishing a sensor link
with the nearest station,

03:52.966 --> 03:54.866
l'm getting readings
from the entire network.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.595
The Starfleet ship
is within range

03:56.669 --> 03:57.829
of one of the farthest sensors

03:57.904 --> 03:59.895
near the outer edges
of the Alpha Quadrant.

04:01.874 --> 04:04.434
lt must be
on a deep- space mission.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.569
l've extrapolated its course.

04:06.646 --> 04:07.908
lt doesn't look
like we'll be able

04:07.981 --> 04:09.471
to keep track of it very long.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.915
The ship should move
out of range in 41 minutes.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.146
Can we use the network
to transmit a message?

04:14.220 --> 04:16.654
Yes, but we'll have
to remodulate our signal

04:16.723 --> 04:18.156
to match the network's
interlink frequency.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.589
We don't have much time.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.320
Get it done, Chakotay.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.764
Seven of Nine to Ensign Kim.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.240
Kim here.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.836
l'm sending you
the interlink frequencies.

04:40.847 --> 04:41.814
Got it.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.712
Seven, how much longer
do we have?

04:43.783 --> 04:44.977
16 minutes.

04:45.051 --> 04:45.983
That should do it.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.280
The sub- space

04:47.353 --> 04:50.322
transceiver is at 200 percent
output and on line.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.322
We're ready.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.722
Open a channel.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.191
Open.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.194
Starfleet vessel...

04:56.262 --> 05:00.460
this is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.433
We are in the Delta Quadrant

05:02.502 --> 05:09.465
at coordinates
18 mark 205 mark 47.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.978
Remodulate your signal to match
our interlink frequency.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.253
We're receiving a transmission.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.618
Let's hear it.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.819
..Starship Voyager.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.326
We are in the...

05:28.394 --> 05:31.921
...at coordinates 18...

05:32.031 --> 05:33.328
Bridge to Seven.
What went wrong?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.332
l don't understand.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.632
My readings show that the
station picked up our message

05:38.705 --> 05:40.673
and relayed it
across the entire network.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.264
We should try widening
the subspace bandwidth

05:42.342 --> 05:43.673
and sending the message again.

05:43.743 --> 05:44.675
Do it.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.143
Transmitting.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.146
The signal is being relayed.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.978
No sign of interference.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.980
Wait. lt's being deflected
back again.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.784
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.418
...the Delta Quadrant
at coord...

06:01.494 --> 06:03.485
l have a possible
explanation, Captain.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.326
As our carrier wave moves
along the network,

06:05.398 --> 06:06.990
it may be degrading.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.227
Can we try
a different kind of signal?

06:09.302 --> 06:10.462
Something stronger?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.527
A holographic datastream
might work.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.300
lt wouldn't degrade
so quickly.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.865
lt would take too long
to reconfigure the message.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.307
- Unless...
- The Doctor.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.640
Exactly.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.270
Bring him to Astrometrics
and l'll meet you there.

06:21.347 --> 06:22.780
We don't have much time.

06:26.853 --> 06:27.877
Doctor.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.323
You have to come with me.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.449
Quickly.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.790
Would you mind
at least telling me

06:34.861 --> 06:35.885
what all this is abou...?

06:41.667 --> 06:43.532
When l requested
more away missions,

06:43.603 --> 06:45.696
this isn't exactly
what l had in mind.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.707
You may be our only chance
to communicate with that ship.

06:48.775 --> 06:49.935
When you get there,

06:50.009 --> 06:52.136
you'll be downloaded
into their EMH system.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.406
l'm sending an initiation
code along with your program

06:54.480 --> 06:56.311
so you'll be
activated immediately.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.371
We have less than 90 seconds

06:57.450 --> 06:59.418
before that ship
moves out of range.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.248
How am l supposed
to get back here?

07:01.320 --> 07:02.446
When you've completed
your mission,

07:02.522 --> 07:04.717
instruct them to move within
range of the sensor network.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.055
With any luck, they'll be
able to send you back

07:07.126 --> 07:08.058
the same way you came.

07:08.127 --> 07:08.650
"Luck"?

07:08.728 --> 07:09.660
l won't lie to you, Doctor.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.162
A lot of things could go wrong.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.562
We're relying
on an alien technology

07:13.633 --> 07:15.828
to send you across thousands
of light- years.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.733
So there's a chance
my program could be lost.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.705
Yes. l'm asking you
to take that chance.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.740
35 seconds.

07:21.808 --> 07:22.797
Doctor?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.706
Far be it from me to turn down

07:24.777 --> 07:26.711
an opportunity
to become a hero.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.711
l'm ready.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.543
Torres to Bridge.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.707
Standing by.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.751
l'm downloading him
into the transceiver array.

07:32.819 --> 07:33.751
Ten seconds.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.447
Good luck, Doctor.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.791
There's that word again.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.369
Hello? ls anyone here?

08:02.548 --> 08:05.016
Computer, identify this ship.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.575
This is the Federation
Starship Prometheus.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.450
Are we in the Alpha Quadrant?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.012
Affirmative.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.421
Huh.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.225
Sick Bay to Bridge.

08:20.733 --> 08:24.601
All right, this is Sick Bay
calling any crew member.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.898
Please respond.

08:28.474 --> 08:32.102
Computer, is the com system
malfunctioning?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.110
Negative.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.908
Then why can't l reach anyone?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.914
Access to
the communications system

08:36.982 --> 08:38.541
has been restricted.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.347
Restricted?
But this is important.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.818
lsn't there some sort of
emergency com channel availa...?

09:08.748 --> 09:09.840
Try to lie still.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.814
You have severe phaser burns.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.686
What happened here?

09:16.722 --> 09:20.089
Romulans.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.684
They've taken over the ship.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.877
Commander, there's
a vessel approaching

09:41.948 --> 09:43.677
on an intercept course.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.774
lt's Starfleet.

09:45.851 --> 09:48.615
l told you to mask
our warp trail.

09:48.688 --> 09:49.620
l've been trying.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.883
These new systems
are unfamiliar.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.584
We should have left
some of the crew alive.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.923
You'd be surprised
how stubborn humans can be.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.552
The Starfleet ship is closing.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.394
Raise shields
and prepare to fire phasers.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.604
Computer, how many Romulans
are on board?

10:08.674 --> 10:09.971
Twenty- seven.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.567
Are there
any Starfleet crew members?

10:12.645 --> 10:13.942
None alive.

10:16.382 --> 10:20.250
Computer, display the design
schematic of this ship

10:20.319 --> 10:23.083
and list general specifications.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.680
USS Prometheus--
experimental prototype

10:25.758 --> 10:28.454
designed for deep- space
tactical assignments.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.290
Primary battle systems

10:30.363 --> 10:34.732
include regenerative shielding,
ablative hull armor,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.098
multivector assault mode.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.831
Multivector assault mode?

10:39.905 --> 10:40.997
Describe.

10:41.073 --> 10:44.907
Access to tactical data
requires level- 4 clearance.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.708
What can you show me
at my clearance level?

10:55.688 --> 10:57.553
Shields are holding.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.285
Engage the multivector
assault mode.

11:00.359 --> 11:01.917
That system has
never been tested.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.552
Then we'll test it now.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.735
l gave you an order,
and l expect you to follow it.

11:09.802 --> 11:12.066
Multivector assault mode now.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.298
Yes, Commander.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.539
lnitiating decoupling sequence.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.546
Auto- separation in ten seconds.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.844
Nine, eight, seven...

11:23.916 --> 11:24.974
Computer, what's happening?

11:25.084 --> 11:25.982
six, five...

11:26.085 --> 11:26.983
Computer?

11:27.086 --> 11:29.316
four, three...

11:29.388 --> 11:31.322
two, one.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.449
Separation sequence in progress.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.894
We're in attack formation.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.906
Each section is armed
and responding to our command.

11:53.112 --> 11:56.513
Attack pattern beta- four- seven.

11:56.582 --> 11:57.844
Specify target.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.614
The Starfleet vessel,
bearing 162 mark 7.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.621
Pattern and target confirmed.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.925
l think we should consider that
a successful test.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.662
Begin the reintegration
sequence.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.329
Then get me
a full damage report.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.702
Yes, Commander.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.143
He's hurt.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.775
Take him to the medical bay.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.161
Reintegration sequence complete.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.432
Computer, is there any way

12:47.500 --> 12:50.264
for me to gain access
to the communication system

12:50.336 --> 12:51.928
to send a message
to another ship?

12:52.004 --> 12:53.471
Negative.

12:53.539 --> 12:57.498
Communications access requires
level- 4 clearance or above.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.927
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.928
Who activated you?

13:17.997 --> 13:18.929
You did.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.692
Automatically,
when you entered Sick Bay.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.234
Can you treat him?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.827
Of course.
That's my function.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.700
Third- degree burns,
hairline jaw fracture

13:30.776 --> 13:33.574
and a ruptured blood
vessel in his brain.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.738
l'll have to operate.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.907
You're a Starfleet program.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.074
Why should l trust you?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.674
l'm a doctor.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.915
Whether my patient
is human or Romulan,

13:42.988 --> 13:45.456
l'll do everything
in my power to save him.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.583
You're welcome to assist me
if you'd like.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.356
Or maybe you'd just prefer
to supervise.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.962
Report to me
when you're finished.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.629
Mm- hmm.

14:08.214 --> 14:12.446
Computer, can l access
this ship's EMH program

14:12.518 --> 14:14.850
or do l need some kind
of clearance for that, too?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.616
Access to that program
is unrestricted.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.657
Activate it.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.921
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.861
What the hell are you doing
in my Sick Bay?

14:31.904 --> 14:34.338
l've been programmed to identify
every member of this crew.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.340
You aren't one of them.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.340
That's because l'm...

14:37.409 --> 14:38.706
State your rank
and security clearance.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.108
l don't have clearance.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.976
l'm an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.878
l've been sent here to...

14:43.949 --> 14:46.281
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.081
You're the Mark- 1 EMH--

14:48.153 --> 14:49.586
the inferior program.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.088
lnferior?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.180
Beady eyes,

14:52.258 --> 14:54.988
terrible bedside manner--
l recognize you.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.426
But you're not part
of this database.

14:57.496 --> 14:58.428
What are you doing here?

14:58.497 --> 15:00.761
lf you disengage
your vocal subroutines

15:00.833 --> 15:02.494
for one second, l'd explain.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.435
l was transmitted onto this ship
by a Starfleet vessel

15:05.504 --> 15:07.563
over 60, 000 light- years
from here.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.574
60, 000 light- years?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.837
We don't have ships
that far out.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.845
lt's the Starship Voyager.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.881
We were taken
into the Delta Quadrant

15:15.948 --> 15:17.381
four years ago
by an alien force...

15:17.449 --> 15:20.714
What are you doing?

15:20.786 --> 15:21.775
Activating intruder alert.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.082
That's the last thing
you want to do.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.087
Security...

15:24.156 --> 15:25.123
Listen to me!

15:25.190 --> 15:26.919
This vessel has been
taken over by Romulans.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.016
The crew is dead.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.924
You and l are the only
Starfleet officers on board.

15:30.029 --> 15:30.996
Do you understand?

15:33.999 --> 15:36.524
Computer, deactivate EMH.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.072
Computer, activate EMH.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.976
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.308
Now what?

15:48.380 --> 15:49.677
l need your help!

15:49.748 --> 15:52.444
Starfleet Security Protocol
28, Subsection D:

15:52.518 --> 15:54.383
"ln the event of
hostile alien takeover,

15:54.453 --> 15:57.320
the EMH is to deactivate
and wait for rescue."

15:57.389 --> 15:58.981
l'm afraid you don't have
that luxury.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.388
There are two ships
at stake here--

16:00.492 --> 16:01.618
yours and mine.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.096
Now, l need to know more
about what's happening.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.155
ls the Federation at war
with the Romulans?

16:07.232 --> 16:09.325
No. The Romulans
haven't gotten involved

16:09.401 --> 16:10.766
in our fight with the Dominion.

16:10.836 --> 16:11.860
The who?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.371
Long story.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.032
ln any case,

16:16.108 --> 16:18.099
we need to take control
of this situation.

16:18.177 --> 16:21.044
l'm a doctor, not a commando.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.705
lt's time you became
a little of both.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.011
You don't understand.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.278
The Prometheus

16:26.352 --> 16:29.321
is an experimental
prototype, and so am l.

16:29.388 --> 16:33.256
l...l...l haven't even
been field- tested yet.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.123
l'm not designed
for this kind of duty.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.786
Try to calm down.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.832
You'll do fine
as long as l'm here.

16:40.899 --> 16:42.867
l have plenty of expertise
in this area.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.402
Now, first things first.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.732
We've got a patient.

16:45.804 --> 16:46.771
You treat his burns.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.931
l'll repair the bone fracture.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.131
You're not serious.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.175
l certainly am.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.209
He's the enemy.

16:51.276 --> 16:52.675
He needs our help.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.736
l assume you're familiar
with the Hippocratic Oath?

16:54.813 --> 16:56.974
You see?
You see what's happening.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.448
The Romulans are using you.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.109
- Hmm.
- Hmm, what?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.413
Your holo- matrix is unstable.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.114
lt may explain
your erratic behavior.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.848
l told you,
l'm a work in progress.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.788
l was only installed
six weeks ago.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.792
Stable or not, l need you,
and so does he.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.021
He'll live.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.122
l say we leave him and
deactivate ourselves.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.223
No!

17:15.300 --> 17:16.665
You're free
to do as you please.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.032
Go cower inside the data
processor if you'd like.

17:19.104 --> 17:20.731
l'll work alone.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.505
We're medical holograms.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.238
What can we expect to do
against a ship full of Romulans?

17:27.311 --> 17:29.212
l'm not sure.

17:29.281 --> 17:30.680
Not yet.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.444
But l've faced
my share of challenges--

17:32.518 --> 17:36.352
alien invasions,
macroviral infestations.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.413
l've crossed Borg space,
traveled through time.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.718
Have you run a
self- diagnostic lately?

17:39.792 --> 17:43.728
The EMH- 1 is designed
to function in Sick Bay only.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.060
Voyager lost its Chief Medical
Officer four years ago.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.689
l've been active ever since.

17:47.766 --> 17:48.824
Four years?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.334
No wonder you're delusional.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.495
Your program's degrading
after being active

17:52.571 --> 17:53.538
for so long.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.072
l assure you
l am in perfect health.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.767
l was saving Voyager
from annihilation

17:56.842 --> 17:58.901
when you were only a gleam
in your programmer's eye.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.275
Now are you going to help me
take back this ship or not?

18:03.515 --> 18:05.107
Get me
the thrombic modulator.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.718
Hmm?

18:14.793 --> 18:17.125
lt's the cone- shaped device.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.891
Hand it to me, please.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.860
Medical science has
made a few advances

18:26.004 --> 18:27.631
while you've been off in the...

18:27.706 --> 18:29.333
Delta Quadrant, did you say?

18:29.408 --> 18:30.432
That's right.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.342
We don't use scalpels
or leeches anymore.

18:33.412 --> 18:37.041
l suggest you let me handle
the medical side of things.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.845
As for retaking the ship,

18:38.917 --> 18:43.286
l'll leave that
in your experienced hands.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.838
No word.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.674
Our link to the sensor net
is stable.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.374
Seven of Nine is standing
watch in Astrometrics.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.007
l tried to relieve her,

19:12.084 --> 19:13.676
but she doesn't want
to leave her post.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.276
She says she doesn't
need to regenerate

19:15.354 --> 19:16.286
for the next few days.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.686
What are you doing?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.490
Letters home.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.586
l started them a year ago.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.324
One to my family...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.801
one to Mark.

19:29.868 --> 19:33.099
l'm making a few updates
just in case.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.605
l know.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.833
lt's premature.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.205
You're right.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.870
lt's probably a mistake for us
to get our hopes up at all.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.503
We've been through this before.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.907
All right, l'll admit it.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.282
l just finished a letter
to my cousin in Ohio.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.924
The Doctor is in.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.628
Lieutenant,
thank God you're here.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.795
What seems to be the trouble?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.465
Well, one minute,
they were eating lunch,

20:08.540 --> 20:10.235
and the next,
they started perspiring

20:10.309 --> 20:11.936
and complaining of chest pain.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.977
Hmm, no wonder.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.173
Acute functional dyspepsia.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.306
What's that?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.781
Heartburn.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.318
Oh, l'm terribly sorry.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.910
l don't know how this
could have happened.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.548
l'll replicate some antacid.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.455
We'll have you feeling
better in no time.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.423
They're going to be
all right, aren't they?

20:32.497 --> 20:36.729
lt's heartburn, Neelix,
not the Terrellian plague.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.498
What did you feed them anyway?

20:39.571 --> 20:42.039
"Rodeo Red's Red Hot,
Rootin' Tootin' Chili."

20:43.575 --> 20:45.475
Where did you find that recipe?

20:45.544 --> 20:48.570
l've been brushing up
on classic American cuisine.

20:48.647 --> 20:51.639
When we get back to Earth,
l want to make sure l have

20:51.717 --> 20:53.412
marketable job skills.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.646
Don't you think you're
jumping the gun a little bit?

20:55.721 --> 20:57.882
The Doctor is going
to make it back

20:57.956 --> 21:01.119
and he's going to bring a plan
for Starfleet to rescue us.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.683
l have complete
confidence in him.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.058
l hope you're right.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.495
lf not, l'm going to spend
the rest of this trip

21:06.565 --> 21:08.055
treating upset stomachs.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.461
Oh, believe me,

21:09.534 --> 21:11.399
this is never going
to happen again.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.337
lt's just a matter
of perfecting the recipe.

21:14.406 --> 21:18.740
Next time, l'll use
a few less chilapenos.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.744
l've accessed
the navigational logs.

21:29.821 --> 21:30.981
We're at warp 9. 9.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.388
Heading straight
for Romulan space.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.120
This vessel was designed
to go faster than anything

21:36.194 --> 21:37.991
in the fleet,
so we'll never be rescued.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.428
We've got to find a way
to turn this ship around.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.525
How? Waltz onto the Bridge
and take over the helm?

21:43.602 --> 21:44.899
Refresh my memory.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.938
Which of us has
the terrible bedside manner?

21:47.005 --> 21:48.302
You're not my patient.

21:48.373 --> 21:49.897
My first bit of good news.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.536
We have to incapacitate
the Romulans somehow.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.641
What kind of anesthetics
do you have handy?

21:57.716 --> 21:58.808
Only the best.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.580
Axonol, neurozine, anesthezine.

22:01.687 --> 22:02.949
Neurozine will do nicely.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.888
lt can be distributed
in gaseous form.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.789
Show me a schematic of the
ship's ventilation system.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.386
Please.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.727
All primary systems have
been rerouted to the Bridge,

22:15.801 --> 22:17.393
including
environmental control.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.097
lt looks like there are
holo- emitters on every deck.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.537
There are.

22:21.606 --> 22:24.973
Unlike you, l'm not
condemned to a Sick Bay.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.601
Get three canisters
of neurozine.

22:29.514 --> 22:33.814
As a matter of record,
l have free rein on Voyager

22:33.885 --> 22:35.648
and l can even leave
the ship as well.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.245
Leave your ship?

22:37.322 --> 22:38.380
How?

22:38.457 --> 22:40.823
My mobile emitter--

22:40.892 --> 22:41.824
a little piece

22:41.893 --> 22:44.361
of 29th- century
technology we obtained.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.521
Really?

22:45.597 --> 22:47.326
l'm as close
to a sentient life- form

22:47.399 --> 22:48.991
as any hologram
could hope to be.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.763
l socialize with the crew,
fraternize with aliens.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.600
l've even had sexual relations.

22:53.672 --> 22:54.969
Sex?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.701
How's that possible?

22:56.775 --> 22:57.742
We're not equipped...

22:57.809 --> 22:59.242
Let's just say

22:59.311 --> 23:01.176
l made an addition
to my program.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.907
Before you leave,
maybe you could

23:03.949 --> 23:06.611
download those subroutines
into my database.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.346
We'll see.

23:12.758 --> 23:13.816
lt looks like the only place

23:13.892 --> 23:15.257
l can access
environmental control

23:15.327 --> 23:16.658
is from the Ops console
on the Bridge.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.822
The Bridge is swarming
with Romulans.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.922
That's the first thing you learn

23:20.999 --> 23:23.399
in the real world--
think on your feet.

23:23.468 --> 23:25.368
Well, good luck then.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.461
Computer, deactivate...

23:26.538 --> 23:27.937
Not so fast.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.973
You're going
to Jefferies Tube 17.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.702
The moment l unlock
the controls,

23:31.777 --> 23:33.972
you release the gas
into the ventilation system.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.307
Jefferies Tube 17?

23:35.380 --> 23:36.404
That's five decks up.

23:36.481 --> 23:37.880
What if l run into Romulans?

23:37.949 --> 23:39.143
lmprovise.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.610
Your journey begins here.

23:51.029 --> 23:54.430
Traditionally, one crawls in
headfirst.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.625
Thanks.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.107
There you are, Doctor.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.775
Have you completed the surgery?

24:12.851 --> 24:15.115
Yes. Your friend
is recovering nicely.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.655
However, l found something
disturbing in his blood work.

24:17.722 --> 24:18.882
lt seems he's been exposed

24:18.957 --> 24:21.357
to a nasty strain
of the Torothka virus,

24:21.426 --> 24:23.360
and if he was,
you may all have been.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.123
l've come to run some scans.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.062
No one here is sick.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.190
Not yet.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.099
l understand the stomach
cramps are unbearable,

24:31.169 --> 24:33.933
although some say
the rash is worse.

24:34.005 --> 24:35.472
Conduct your scans.

24:40.712 --> 24:42.680
How far are we from our border?

24:42.747 --> 24:45.375
At our present
velocity, 40 minutes.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.419
Alter our heading
to 1 18 mark 26.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.581
That will take us
off our course to Romulus.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.215
There's been a change of plans.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.520
We're giving this ship
to someone

24:55.594 --> 24:57.186
who will make use
of its full potential--

24:57.262 --> 24:58.354
the Tal Shiar.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.692
l've made arrangements
to rendezvous

24:59.764 --> 25:00.958
with their fleet
within the hour.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.034
But, Commander,
they're expecting us...

25:03.068 --> 25:04.558
You have your orders.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.035
What are you doing?

25:11.109 --> 25:14.272
l'm checking the biofilters
for evidence of the virus.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.672
You haven't taken
any readings at all.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.443
Hmm.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.496
Next time...

25:32.564 --> 25:34.031
order the chicken salad.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.471
Oh! Am l glad to see you.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.563
What's the emergency?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.608
Take a look around you, Harry.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.738
What do you see?

25:47.812 --> 25:49.439
Sick Bay?

25:49.514 --> 25:50.572
Exactly.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.082
So?

25:52.150 --> 25:55.085
So, it's not the helm
of a starship, is it?

25:55.153 --> 25:57.178
Did you accidentally
inject yourself

25:57.255 --> 25:59.382
with some kind
of psychotropic agent?

25:59.457 --> 26:01.618
l am a pilot, Harry,
not a doctor.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.523
This is a temporary assignment--

26:03.562 --> 26:04.790
just till the Doc gets back.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.262
What if he doesn't get back?

26:06.331 --> 26:07.320
He'll be back.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.458
l need your help, Harry.

26:09.534 --> 26:11.502
Rescue me from medical exile.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.537
How?

26:14.339 --> 26:17.308
You're an expert
in holo- technology.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.639
You have got
to design a new Doctor.

26:20.679 --> 26:22.704
You really are delirious.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.306
lt took the greatest
holo- engineers in Starfleet

26:25.383 --> 26:26.714
years to develop the EMH.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.481
l can't just design
a new Doctor.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.584
Think of it
as a challenge, Harry--

26:33.658 --> 26:36.286
a chance to make history

26:36.361 --> 26:38.591
and save your best friend
all at the same time.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.264
Lieutenant Torres.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.707
You are recalibrating
the relay interface.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.182
That's right.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.584
State your reasons for
making these modifications.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.216
"State your reasons,
please."

27:06.291 --> 27:07.849
lt's not what you say, Seven.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.018
lt's how you say it.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.994
l don't understand.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.461
You may have noticed

27:17.535 --> 27:21.027
that some of the crew
seem a bit...on edge

27:21.106 --> 27:22.437
when you're around.

27:22.507 --> 27:23.474
l was Borg.

27:23.541 --> 27:25.008
l elicit apprehension.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.010
No, that's not what l mean.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.512
We're not afraid that you're
going to assimilate us.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.310
We're just not used to...

27:31.383 --> 27:33.112
You just...

27:35.153 --> 27:36.643
You're rude.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.090
l am rude.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.124
Yes.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.351
Yes. You order people around;

27:41.426 --> 27:42.723
you do things
without permission;

27:42.794 --> 27:44.159
and whether you realize it
or not,

27:44.229 --> 27:45.662
you come off
as a little insulting.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.893
You don't even say
"please" or"thank you."

27:48.967 --> 27:52.266
Look, l don't expect you
to change overnight,

27:52.337 --> 27:54.328
but try to remember

27:54.406 --> 27:56.874
that we are not just
a bunch of drones.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.948
Your attempt to recalibrate
the interface is ill- advised.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.486
The risk of disrupting
our link is too great.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.715
ln your opinion.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.849
That is exactly
what l'm talking about.

28:13.925 --> 28:15.187
You haven't even been
listening to me.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.228
l don't know why l try to talk
to you if you don't even...

28:18.530 --> 28:19.690
Are we losing the link?

28:19.764 --> 28:21.459
No. We're receiving
a transmission

28:21.533 --> 28:22.693
from the relay station.

28:22.767 --> 28:23.734
The Doctor?

28:26.304 --> 28:27.771
What are you?

28:27.839 --> 28:30.808
l'm Lieutenant Torres
of the Starship Voyager.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.435
You are using our technology.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.445
You mean the sensor network?

28:35.513 --> 28:37.708
We thought
that it was abandoned.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.546
lt belongs to the Hirogen.
Terminate your link.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.313
No, no, wait, please.
We just...

28:43.688 --> 28:45.656
The link has been severed.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.222
What else have you done
to this ship?

28:57.335 --> 28:58.927
l will deactivate you

28:59.070 --> 29:01.197
unless you start
answering my questions.

29:01.306 --> 29:02.500
lf l answer them,

29:02.540 --> 29:04.167
you'll very likely
deactivate me anyway,

29:04.242 --> 29:05.368
so l fail to see the point.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.946
You are nothing

29:09.013 --> 29:12.005
but a computer- generated
projection.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.550
l find it hard to believe

29:13.618 --> 29:16.849
you're capable of taking
these actions independently.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.445
How flattering.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.981
Tell me who is
operating your program.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.392
ls it someone on this ship?

29:24.462 --> 29:26.862
A Starfleet crew member
we missed

29:26.931 --> 29:29.058
or one of my own men?

29:29.134 --> 29:32.069
Paranoia is a way of life
for you, isn't it?

29:39.744 --> 29:40.870
The computer log shows

29:41.012 --> 29:43.913
the ship received an optronic
datastream transmission

29:44.015 --> 29:46.506
approximately six hours ago.

29:46.584 --> 29:49.610
lt contained
a holographic subroutine.

29:49.687 --> 29:50.745
Who sent it?

29:50.822 --> 29:54.519
Unknown. The data pattern
had a Starfleet signature.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.088
So, Starfleet has managed

29:59.164 --> 30:02.930
to sneak a holographic
operative aboard.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.127
Very clever.

30:04.202 --> 30:06.534
Were you only sent to spy on us

30:06.604 --> 30:09.471
or does your mission
include sabotage?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.237
The datastream you detected

30:12.310 --> 30:13.937
came from an alien
sensor network.

30:14.012 --> 30:14.979
lt transferred me

30:15.079 --> 30:17.707
from a Starfleet ship
in the Delta Quadrant.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.773
The Delta Quadrant?

30:19.851 --> 30:21.113
That's absurd.

30:21.186 --> 30:22.153
This is pointless.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.187
l couldn't agree more.

30:25.356 --> 30:26.755
Maybe there's a better way

30:26.825 --> 30:29.726
to retrieve information
from a hologram.

30:29.794 --> 30:32.922
l suggest a complete
algorithm extraction.

30:32.997 --> 30:36.125
We can analyze
his subroutines one by one.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.498
Proceed.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.906
lsn't there some kind
of convention

30:41.973 --> 30:43.702
regarding the treatment
of prisoners?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.753
Did it work?

30:56.821 --> 30:59.289
Sorry to interrupt.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.915
Did you anesthetize
the entire ship?

31:01.025 --> 31:01.957
l did, l did.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.483
How did you manage
to release the neurozine?

31:03.561 --> 31:04.823
l never opened
the ventilation system.

31:04.896 --> 31:08.923
Trapped in the Jefferies tube,
alone, nowhere to run,

31:09.000 --> 31:12.936
his smug comrade
captured by Romulans,

31:13.037 --> 31:15.267
EMH- 2 had to improvise.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.364
lnspiration.

31:16.441 --> 31:19.842
He accessed the main computer
and simulated a shipwide

31:19.911 --> 31:21.936
biohazard, making the
computer think there was

31:22.080 --> 31:24.241
a microbiotic contamination
on all decks.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.681
And the ventilation system
opened automatically.

31:26.751 --> 31:29.311
Presto. He then crawled
back out of the tube,

31:29.387 --> 31:31.548
accessed the holo- emitters,
transferred here,

31:31.623 --> 31:32.988
excused the Romulan,

31:33.057 --> 31:35.525
saw the dumbfounded look
on his comrade's face...

31:35.593 --> 31:36.958
The end.

31:37.028 --> 31:38.791
You know, you really should
keep a personal log.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.455
Why bore others needlessly?

31:40.531 --> 31:43.364
We have to get to the Bridge.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.958
This ship needs a crew,
and we're it.

31:45.036 --> 31:47.402
Oh...trouble.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.940
The Prometheus is a prototype--
top secret.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.168
Only four people

31:51.242 --> 31:54.040
in all of Starfleet were
trained to operate it.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.047
l hope
your myriad adventures

31:57.115 --> 31:59.982
included piloting lessons

32:00.051 --> 32:01.348
because there's nothing
in my program

32:01.386 --> 32:02.580
that will help us
fly this thing.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.781
l've had my share of
piloting experience.

32:04.856 --> 32:08.485
Actually...only two lessons

32:08.559 --> 32:10.686
and they were
in a shuttlecraft...

32:10.762 --> 32:11.888
on the holodeck,

32:11.963 --> 32:13.658
but l showed great intuition.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.199
Where's the helm?

32:16.267 --> 32:18.667
You'd better intuit it fast.

32:18.736 --> 32:21.603
We're only about eight minutes
from the Romulan border.

32:21.673 --> 32:22.833
Ah, there it is.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.512
This is all very...

32:33.584 --> 32:34.608
complicated.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.983
Stop breathing down my neck.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.714
My breathing is
merely a simulation.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.586
So is my neck.
Stop it anyway.

32:39.657 --> 32:40.851
ls this a thruster control?

32:40.925 --> 32:42.586
Don't touch that.
We don't know what it does.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.685
lt could be the self- destruct.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.195
You look worried.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.858
l'm just...concentrating.

32:48.933 --> 32:50.696
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

32:50.768 --> 32:52.167
This is not a shuttle

32:52.236 --> 32:53.533
and we are not on a holodeck.

32:53.604 --> 32:54.536
Shh...

32:54.605 --> 32:56.129
Mr."l can leave my ship."

32:56.207 --> 32:57.469
The voice of experience.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.509
Let me think.

32:59.544 --> 33:00.442
Ah, here it is.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.604
This looks like
the nacelle power control.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.841
So? So?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.815
There's a little trick
l saw Mr. Paris do once.

33:05.883 --> 33:07.646
lf l can generate
a slight overload

33:07.719 --> 33:10.517
to the nacelle coils,
it'll collapse the warp field.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.585
What happened?

33:13.658 --> 33:16.627
l did it. We've stopped.

33:16.694 --> 33:18.924
Ah...all we have to do now
is find a way

33:19.030 --> 33:21.430
to send Starfleet
a distress signal and...

33:23.234 --> 33:25.498
Beep- beep- beep.
Beep- beep- beep?

33:25.570 --> 33:27.333
l've never heard
that one before.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.169
Oh, no.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.212
What?

33:35.279 --> 33:37.577
l'm not sure,
but l think whatever l did

33:37.648 --> 33:39.582
initiated a warp core overload.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.413
You mean the ship's
going to explode?

33:41.486 --> 33:43.454
You've got to stop it.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.525
Ah...no problem.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.531
What now?

34:02.607 --> 34:04.074
Unless l'm mistaken,

34:04.142 --> 34:06.167
and for once,
l sincerely hope l am,

34:06.244 --> 34:10.578
there are three Romulan warbirds
on an intercept course.

34:17.955 --> 34:21.152
We're boosting the signal gain
as high as it'll go.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.455
l think we can cut through
the alien's jamming signal.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.120
l warned you.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.289
l apologize for our intrusion.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.696
Allow me to explain.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.324
No explanations.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.926
Your relay network
gave us the unique opportunity

34:33.004 --> 34:34.733
to communicate with our people.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.034
They are very far away

34:36.107 --> 34:37.938
and we're expecting
a message back from them.

34:38.009 --> 34:41.376
All messages
will be intercepted.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.281
He's trying to jam
the link again.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.110
There must be some room
for negotiation.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.311
lsn't there anything you might
accept in exchange for...?

34:49.053 --> 34:50.543
What happened?

34:50.621 --> 34:54.148
l generated a feedback surge
along our sensor link.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.692
You killed him?

34:57.762 --> 34:59.161
lt was a mild shock.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.322
He will recover.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.830
And when he does?

35:03.568 --> 35:05.502
He wasn't responding
to diplomacy.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.434
ls the sensor link stable?

35:12.577 --> 35:13.669
Yes, Captain.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.575
Keep watching for the Doctor.

35:15.646 --> 35:19.138
Let me know if our friend
gives us any more trouble.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.880
"Mild shock."

35:27.325 --> 35:29.384
Not bad.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.757
Thank you.

35:35.199 --> 35:36.530
There. l finished inputting

35:36.601 --> 35:38.466
the Doctor's physical
characteristics.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.367
Let's have a look.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.030
Computer, activate the Emergency

35:42.106 --> 35:44.904
Medical Hologram
Replacement Program.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.478
Do you think we should give him
a little more hair?

35:51.549 --> 35:54.518
What do you say we try
to get him working first,

35:54.585 --> 35:56.780
then we can worry
about personal grooming.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.549
Right. You're the boss.

35:58.623 --> 35:59.783
What do we do next?

35:59.857 --> 36:01.119
l've downloaded
the ship's entire

36:01.225 --> 36:04.217
medical library and compressed
it into a single data file.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.854
lt's got all the classics--
from Gray's Anatomy

36:05.963 --> 36:08.727
to Leonard McCoy's
Comparative Alien Physiology.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.563
And once we transfer
all the data

36:11.636 --> 36:14.833
into stone face's matrix,

36:14.906 --> 36:17.306
we'll have ourselves
a brand- new medical expert.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.240
That's what l'm hoping.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.039
Harry, you are a genius.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.774
Don't congratulate me yet.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.145
This is only the first step.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.911
Yeah, but it's a step
in the right direction.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.282
l'm telling you, this probably
isn't going to work.

36:30.488 --> 36:33.685
What happened
to all that youthful optimism?

36:33.858 --> 36:36.224
Being a Doctor is a lot more
than knowing the facts.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.421
We still have to create
analytical subroutines

36:38.496 --> 36:39.929
to help him diagnose patients,

36:39.997 --> 36:42.192
tactile protocols,
so he can perform surgery,

36:42.266 --> 36:43.426
not to mention
a personality profile.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.435
Oh, you know, l've been
thinking about that.

36:45.503 --> 36:50.202
Maybe we should make this one
a little more...pleasant

36:50.274 --> 36:51.741
than the old Doc.

36:54.612 --> 36:58.548
All right. l'm ready
to transfer the data.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.813
Computer, transfer
medical library master file

37:01.919 --> 37:05.286
to Emergency Medical
Replacement Hologram.

37:05.323 --> 37:06.722
Transfer complete.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.622
Chapter one: The Animal Cell.

37:08.693 --> 37:09.853
"All the tissues of the body

37:09.927 --> 37:12.157
"originate from a microscopic
structure, the fertilized ovum,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.221
"which consists of a soft,
jelly- like material

37:14.298 --> 37:15.697
enclosed in a membrane
and containing a..."

37:15.766 --> 37:16.698
What's he doing?

37:16.767 --> 37:18.064
"...or small spherical body
inside..."

37:18.135 --> 37:19.762
l think he's reciting
Gray's Anatomy.

37:19.837 --> 37:22.397
"This may be regarded
as a complete cell."

37:22.473 --> 37:23.701
Can you stop him?

37:23.774 --> 37:25.105
l'm trying.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.167
"...in nature,
but differing in external form."

37:27.245 --> 37:28.212
Paragraph.

37:28.279 --> 37:29.837
Listen, this is all
very fascinating...

37:29.914 --> 37:30.881
"ln the higher organisms...

37:30.948 --> 37:33.473
but would you please
be quiet for a minute?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.746
He doesn't have speech
recognition protocols yet.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.117
Well, give him some, would you?

37:37.188 --> 37:38.849
"...similar to that
found in the ovum

37:38.923 --> 37:40.652
and usually called cytoplasm..."

37:40.725 --> 37:41.919
What's happening?

37:41.993 --> 37:42.925
lt's an overload.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.928
His matrix can't
accommodate all the data.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.328
"Contain no nuclei..."

37:57.275 --> 37:58.708
What are you doing?

37:58.776 --> 38:01.643
l'm downloading Gray's Anatomy
chapter by chapter.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.611
l thought you said
it was too much data

38:03.648 --> 38:05.013
for his holo- matrix to handle.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.243
lt's not for the EMH.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.445
lt's for you.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.362
The Romulan vessels
are closing in.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.162
Two minutes to intercept.
Get us out of here!

38:24.235 --> 38:26.135
l can't get this ship moving.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.603
Try rerouting power
to the impulse engines.

38:28.673 --> 38:29.537
Reroute power, reroute power.

38:29.607 --> 38:30.539
Here we go.

38:30.608 --> 38:31.768
l think l found
the relay controls.

38:31.842 --> 38:33.241
Hey, l'm finally getting
the hang of this.

38:34.679 --> 38:35.839
What's happening?

38:35.913 --> 38:37.380
Sorry. l must have
transferred power

38:37.448 --> 38:38.380
from the holo- emitters.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.416
Well, be more careful.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.415
lf l'm deactivated,

38:40.484 --> 38:42.042
this ship will never
get back to Starfleet.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.883
Okay, l'm taking power
from life support.

38:44.955 --> 38:47.219
We don't need that.
Try engines now.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.750
Nothing.
Why isn't this working?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.159
30 seconds to intercept.

38:52.229 --> 38:53.719
They're right on top of us.

38:53.798 --> 38:56.562
Hold it.
l see the problem.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.727
The thrust initiator
is off- line.

38:58.803 --> 38:59.929
- Stand by.
- 15 seconds.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.596
They're charging weapons!

39:01.639 --> 39:03.266
See if you can access
the shields.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.273
l said...

39:04.342 --> 39:05.434
l said shields...

39:05.509 --> 39:07.374
Already done. Shields up.

39:07.445 --> 39:10.744
This is the Warbird T'Met
calling the Prometheus.

39:12.249 --> 39:15.275
Commander Rekar...respond.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.752
Commander.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.449
This is the Prometheus.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.548
Activate your viewscreen.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.758
Our viewscreen
is not operational.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.662
We've had some trouble
with Starfleet commandos.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.359
Where's Rekar?

39:31.302 --> 39:32.291
ln the medical bay.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.270
He suffered minor injuries.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.533
ldentify yourself.

39:36.607 --> 39:37.767
You first.

39:37.842 --> 39:39.537
You first.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.578
Repeat your last statement.

39:41.645 --> 39:42.873
l don't understand.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.916
State your identity.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.610
This is Sub- Commander Almar.

39:47.685 --> 39:50.586
Lower your shields
and prepare to be boarded.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.256
They're already down.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.259
Maybe there's something wrong
with your sensor readings.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.589
You'd better not
try to transport

39:57.661 --> 39:58.855
until we can be sure it's safe.

39:58.929 --> 40:02.057
Lower your shields immediately,
or l'll open fire.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.725
lmmediately?

40:03.801 --> 40:06.065
Yes. Prometheus out.

40:07.204 --> 40:08.796
Direct hit.

40:08.873 --> 40:10.773
Shields down to 20 percent.

40:11.942 --> 40:14.376
Three more ships
are approaching.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.776
We're doomed.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.071
No.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.913
They're Starfleet.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.611
What are they doing?

40:23.687 --> 40:24.949
Firing on us.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.683
They must think
Romulans are on board.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.815
They're right!

40:42.406 --> 40:45.398
Prometheus to any
Starfleet vessel. Respond.

40:45.476 --> 40:46.408
Prometheus...

40:46.477 --> 40:47.671
lt's no use.
They can't hear us.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.337
The Romulans have scrambled
the com frequencies.

40:50.414 --> 40:53.679
Doctor, some...thing
just went off- line.

40:53.751 --> 40:54.945
Specifically?

40:55.019 --> 40:56.509
The secondary gyrodyne relays

40:56.587 --> 40:58.487
in the propulsion field
inter- matrix have depolarized.

40:58.556 --> 40:59.488
ln English.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.422
l'm just reading
what it says here.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.254
l'll try to stabilize the ship.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.558
Transfer auxiliary power
to the maneuvering thrusters.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.323
Transferring auxiliary power
now.

41:12.069 --> 41:13.297
Good work, Mark- 2.

41:13.370 --> 41:14.302
Thanks.

41:14.371 --> 41:15.565
You'd better get to tactical.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.072
We're going to have
to defend ourselves.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.802
Tactical. Right.

41:18.876 --> 41:19.843
What are you waiting for?

41:19.910 --> 41:21.002
Shoot.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.271
Shoot!

41:23.347 --> 41:25.076
There are so many controls.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.810
Find the one that says"fire"
and push it!

41:28.452 --> 41:29.646
lt's not working.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.688
lt says here
the phasers are off- line.

41:31.755 --> 41:32.949
Well, then fire a torpedo.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.154
You hit the wrong ship.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.530
lt wasn't my fault.

41:43.601 --> 41:45.125
Well, then, whose fault was it,
the torpedo's?

41:45.202 --> 41:46.499
You're supposed
to tell it what to do.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.806
Navigational control
is off- line.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.139
Everything is off- line--
weapons, shields...

41:53.210 --> 41:54.177
lt gets worse.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.270
There are two warbirds
coming right at us.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.838
My brilliant existence
cut short...

41:58.916 --> 42:00.474
No time to explore
the universe...

42:00.584 --> 42:02.313
no time to smell the roses...

42:02.353 --> 42:04.480
no time for...sex.

42:04.555 --> 42:07.786
lnitiating decoupling sequence.

42:07.858 --> 42:08.790
What's that?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.156
What have l done now?

42:10.227 --> 42:12.195
Auto- separation in ten seconds.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.389
Auto- separation?

42:13.464 --> 42:15.227
l think the Romulans
did this before.

42:15.299 --> 42:16.357
How do we turn it off?

42:16.433 --> 42:17.627
l don't think we can.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.933
...Five, four, three, two...

42:22.006 --> 42:23.064
lf l recall correctly,

42:23.140 --> 42:24.767
this next part gets
a little bumpy.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.673
Separation sequence in progress.

42:28.512 --> 42:30.639
Hold on.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.205
Specify attack pattern.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.650
Attack pattern...alpha?

42:35.719 --> 42:37.118
Specify target.

42:37.187 --> 42:38.711
- Romulans!
- Romulans!

42:48.032 --> 42:49.556
Bull's- eye!

42:49.633 --> 42:51.100
The warbirds are in retreat.

42:51.168 --> 42:52.601
Doctor, we've done it!

42:52.670 --> 42:54.763
Two holograms alone...

42:54.838 --> 42:56.931
Romulans on one side,
Starfleet on the other--

42:57.007 --> 42:58.668
alarms beeping everywhere.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.870
EMH- 2-- newborn
but filled with courage.

43:01.979 --> 43:04.948
EMH- 1-- armed
with years of experience.

43:04.982 --> 43:06.882
Together,
they emerged triumphant.

43:06.951 --> 43:08.316
The end.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.987
Or not.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.485
Welcome to the
Prometheus, gentlemen.

43:17.561 --> 43:18.528
lt's about time.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.868
l'm receiving a transmission
through the sensor network.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.405
Origin...

43:29.473 --> 43:31.065
the Alpha Quadrant.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.670
Does it contain
a holographic subroutine?

43:35.946 --> 43:37.413
Yes.

43:37.481 --> 43:38.914
Transfer it to Sick Bay.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.348
Torres to Bridge.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.045
Captain, l think he's back.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.398
Doctor...

44:01.505 --> 44:03.268
report.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.037
l...l did it.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.044
You completed the mission?

44:08.112 --> 44:10.740
Yes. Once the Romulans
were out of the way.

44:10.814 --> 44:11.781
Romulans?

44:11.849 --> 44:13.077
They'd taken over

44:13.150 --> 44:14.879
the Prometheus--
the ship l was on.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.011
But l managed
to turn the tables on them

44:17.087 --> 44:18.611
with a little help
from a fellow EMH.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.384
You got through to Starfleet?

44:20.457 --> 44:22.152
l spoke directly
with Headquarters.

44:22.226 --> 44:25.684
Apparently, Voyager
was declared officially lost

44:25.763 --> 44:26.923
14 months ago.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.624
l set the record straight.

44:28.699 --> 44:31.600
l told them everything
that's happened to this crew.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.603
They said they would
contact your families

44:33.671 --> 44:35.468
to tell them the news
and promised

44:35.539 --> 44:38.167
that they won't stop
until they've found a way

44:38.242 --> 44:39.732
to get Voyager back home.

44:41.578 --> 44:44.547
And they asked me
to relay a message.

44:45.883 --> 44:48.647
They wanted you to know...

44:48.719 --> 44:50.846
you're no longer alone.

44:54.892 --> 44:57.656
60, 000 light- years

44:57.728 --> 45:00.663
seems a little closer today.
