00:51.159 --> 00:54.532
I got maker's mark, bushmills.
What do you want, handsome?

00:54.567 --> 00:56.337
Nothing, thank you.
I'm fine.

00:56.372 --> 00:59.412
So just how long you been
a private dick on the side?

00:59.446 --> 01:01.350
Only a few months.

01:01.384 --> 01:04.456
I know it's strange but it's
kind of my way to help people.

01:04.492 --> 01:08.567
It's good because
I want you to help me.

01:10.607 --> 01:12.979
I think my wife's been
having an affair on the side.

01:13.013 --> 01:15.217
She's been suppressing
a smile for weeks.

01:15.252 --> 01:17.222
I want you to figure out
what's going on.

01:17.257 --> 01:18.860
I don't know
if I feel comfortable.

01:18.894 --> 01:20.429
Louis showed me
your ad in Craigslist.

01:20.464 --> 01:22.568
It said your rates are quite fair.
How much do you charge?

01:22.602 --> 01:24.038
A hundred a day plus expenses.

01:24.073 --> 01:26.276
- How does 500 sound?
- Mr. Antrem.

01:26.311 --> 01:29.683
Deal.
Keep the clip and come on...

01:29.717 --> 01:31.989
it's Richard.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.594
- Well, I could use the money.
- Good!

01:34.628 --> 01:37.534
So listen, I got it all figured
it out how we're gonna do this.

01:37.568 --> 01:39.973
Tomorrow night I told her
I'm going out of town.

01:40.008 --> 01:41.609
She's got pilates at 7:00.

01:41.644 --> 01:45.084
I want you to plant yourself
in my closet in our bedroom.

01:45.119 --> 01:47.589
- What, why?
- So you can see who she's fucking.

01:47.623 --> 01:50.295
If there's any action, you
text me, I'll be right over.

01:50.329 --> 01:52.399
I've got room at the
harbor club for the night.

01:52.434 --> 01:53.936
I don't know.
Sounds risky.

01:53.971 --> 01:55.606
Oh, come on!
It's a snap.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.579
If she's not screwing anybody, she's
taking two Ambien every night.

01:58.613 --> 02:00.683
She'll be dead to the world.
You'll sneak right out of there.

02:00.717 --> 02:03.755
Maybe you should hire a
more experienced Detective.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.363
Listen, George is an idiot,

02:07.397 --> 02:10.602
but his one decent trait...

02:10.637 --> 02:12.707
he surrounds himself
with good people,

02:12.741 --> 02:15.880
so I trust you intrinsically
and I want you for this job.

02:19.354 --> 02:21.057
Okay, I'll take the case.

02:21.091 --> 02:23.094
So how is George anyway?

02:23.128 --> 02:25.632
- He's good... - You know what
I can't stand about him?

02:25.666 --> 02:28.370
Whatever you're doing
he wants to do.

02:28.405 --> 02:31.710
Whatever you've got, he wants.
You ever notice that?

02:31.744 --> 02:33.780
- Yeah.
- He's just a big

02:33.815 --> 02:37.154
narcissistic
nipple-sucking infant,

02:37.188 --> 02:39.090
you know?

02:39.124 --> 02:41.091
- George, give me that titty.
- Richard!

02:41.125 --> 02:42.958
Oh, Louis.

02:42.993 --> 02:46.060
You remember your old
boxing opponent Jonathan?

02:46.094 --> 02:48.729
- Hello, Louis. - Hello, Jonathan.
I heard your novel was rejected.

02:48.763 --> 02:51.197
- Yes, but... - No wonder
you're on the casting couch.

02:51.231 --> 02:54.767
You're looking for work. There's a position
in the mailroom if you're interested.

02:54.801 --> 02:57.603
- What are you talking about?
- Don't be so fey, Louis.

02:57.637 --> 02:59.538
Could you come back
in 10 minutes, please?

02:59.572 --> 03:03.308
Jonathan and I are finishing up
some very important business.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.847
I'm so sorry.
He's very possessive in his own way.

03:11.882 --> 03:14.983
<i>His father was
a child psychologist;</i>

03:15.017 --> 03:18.119
made him sleep in a box.
I think it aged him prematurely.

03:20.255 --> 03:22.022
Oh, I didn't know.

03:25.359 --> 03:28.994
If George knew I was working
for Antrem, he'd be really hurt,

03:29.029 --> 03:30.763
but I need the money.

03:30.798 --> 03:33.032
- George will never know.
- I hope not,

03:33.066 --> 03:35.034
but I still feel guilty.

03:35.068 --> 03:37.836
It's just too bad that Antrem
doesn't trust his wife.

03:37.870 --> 03:40.172
They should just have
an open relationship.

03:40.206 --> 03:42.541
Monogamy sucks!
It never works.

03:42.576 --> 03:44.510
Didn't know that you
felt that way.

03:44.545 --> 03:48.045
Do you have an open mind
about relationships?

03:48.080 --> 03:50.213
Yes, I have an open mind.

03:50.248 --> 03:53.950
Well, I'd like our relationship to be...
open.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.651
A lot of people
at the food club

03:55.686 --> 03:58.954
are experimenting with polyamory
and I want us to try it.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.523
What? I can't just
go from an open mind

04:01.557 --> 04:03.324
to an open relationship.

04:03.358 --> 04:06.260
We need to talk about this
for months and never act on it.

04:06.294 --> 04:09.530
Jonathan, I realize that this
is coming out of the blue,

04:09.564 --> 04:12.132
but I want to see other people.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.700
Wait, wait a second.
Wha-wha... what brought this on?

04:14.734 --> 04:16.267
I thought you were
happy with me.

04:16.302 --> 04:18.269
We found your g-spot
and everything.

04:18.303 --> 04:20.103
I know. I know.

04:20.139 --> 04:22.639
My first love has
come back to Brooklyn

04:22.674 --> 04:24.907
and he's the other person
I want to see,

04:24.942 --> 04:27.376
but I also don't want
to lose you.

04:27.410 --> 04:29.944
I-I can't believe this.
Who's this first love?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.746
His name is Warren.
We went to bard together.

04:32.781 --> 04:36.684
- Well, he's agreed to it.
- You checked with him before me?!

04:36.718 --> 04:38.485
I just want us all to have

04:38.519 --> 04:40.687
an overnight group cuddle

04:40.722 --> 04:43.824
just so that we can see
how we all get along.

04:43.858 --> 04:46.293
God, Stella, a sleepover?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.328
It'll be fun.
You'll like Warren.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.096
He's a struggling comedian.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.931
You guys have a lot in common.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.933
- Because I'm struggling?
- No!

04:53.967 --> 04:56.902
Because he's funny
and sweet like you.

04:56.936 --> 05:00.772
No, I will not have a three-way
cuddle with a struggling comedian.

05:00.806 --> 05:03.074
Come on, Jonathan,
you're a writer.

05:03.109 --> 05:06.243
Henry Miller
would have done it.

05:07.278 --> 05:09.813
You can be my Henry Miller.

05:12.582 --> 05:14.516
I do like Henry Miller.

05:14.550 --> 05:16.884
But wait, if I'm Henry Miller

05:16.918 --> 05:18.419
then who's Warren?

05:18.453 --> 05:20.320
He'll be...

05:20.355 --> 05:22.422
- Bukowski.
- I wanna be Bukowski.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.390
Okay, you are Bukowski.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.926
I always loved Bukowski.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.934
- Hi, I'm Dr. Kenwood.
- Oh.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.270
Uh, George Christopher.

05:38.304 --> 05:39.971
Where's Dr. Rebonowitz?

05:40.006 --> 05:43.340
Oh, he retired. I've taken over his practice.
We sent out an email.

05:43.374 --> 05:45.342
I didn't get it, I guess.

05:45.377 --> 05:47.144
- I'm on AOL.
- Sorry.

05:47.178 --> 05:50.013
So what brings you to me today?

05:50.048 --> 05:51.982
Uh...

05:52.016 --> 05:54.584
Well, I've had this
terrific pain.

05:54.618 --> 05:58.086
It's like one of those,
uh, little piranhas

05:58.120 --> 06:00.021
got inside of my penis.

06:00.055 --> 06:03.224
What do you think would
cause such a thing?

06:03.258 --> 06:05.726
Off the top of my head
I would say urethral scarring.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.194
What?
Oh my God, why...

06:07.228 --> 06:10.063
- Why would I have scarring?
- A long active sex life.

06:10.097 --> 06:11.464
Does that apply to you?

06:11.498 --> 06:15.501
Well, I've always admired
the French lifestyle,

06:15.535 --> 06:17.936
- if you know what I mean?
- Yes, I understand.

06:17.971 --> 06:20.472
All right, feet up.

06:23.209 --> 06:25.977
Look at those.

06:34.819 --> 06:36.520
Is that really necessary?

06:36.554 --> 06:37.821
Sometimes.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.090
Also it's good for spotting
tiny venereal warts.

06:42.759 --> 06:44.493
Oh God.

06:47.463 --> 06:50.465
You know, I don't recall
Dr. Rebonowitz having stirrups.

06:50.499 --> 06:53.134
- Is this something new?
- Yes, it's my own innovation.

06:53.169 --> 06:55.470
I thought of it when
I was at the gynecologist.

06:55.504 --> 06:59.072
This way when I finger your
prostate I can see your face

06:59.107 --> 07:02.841
and gauge your reaction.
Makes me a better and more effective doctor.

07:04.711 --> 07:07.278
Is it strange as
a female urologist

07:07.313 --> 07:09.347
to deal with men?

07:09.381 --> 07:12.416
No, I've always been intrigued
with the male anatomy.

07:12.450 --> 07:14.216
As a girl I loved horses.

07:14.251 --> 07:16.118
Right.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.953
- Okay.
- So, uh,

07:18.988 --> 07:20.855
how are we doing down there?

07:20.890 --> 07:22.824
So far so good.

07:22.858 --> 07:26.094
But you have bed bugs.

07:26.128 --> 07:29.029
- What? - Didn't you notice
the little red bites?

07:30.465 --> 07:33.032
Oh, I thought that was chafing.

07:33.067 --> 07:35.234
Oh God, this is
so embarrassing.

07:35.269 --> 07:37.837
Not at all, the whole city's
infected with bedbugs.

07:37.871 --> 07:39.705
Bloomberg probably has them.

07:39.739 --> 07:41.872
<i>You're gonna need to bomb
your apartment.</i>

07:41.907 --> 07:43.240
Oh lord.

07:43.274 --> 07:46.042
My fingers are gonna
feel a little cold.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.782
How does that feel?

07:53.217 --> 07:55.817
It feels comforting actually.

07:56.719 --> 07:58.752
Hmm.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.473
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

09:43.507 --> 09:45.341
<i>All right,
just hold on.</i>

09:45.375 --> 09:46.808
<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

09:54.349 --> 09:56.984
<i>Just put it in me now.
I can't wait!</i>

09:59.888 --> 10:02.823
<i>- Do you feel filled up?
- Yes yes.</i>

10:02.857 --> 10:06.359
<i>What's my name?
I want to hear you say it.</i>

10:06.394 --> 10:10.162
<i>- Nosferatu.
- No, you forgot to say "great."</i>

10:10.196 --> 10:13.231
<i>- The great Nosferatu.
- Sorry, dear.</i>

10:13.265 --> 10:15.266
<i>All right,
do it again.</i>

10:18.001 --> 10:20.970
<i>George left at midnight.
Then she took two Ambien.</i>

10:21.004 --> 10:24.573
It was one of the worst
nights of my life.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.674
Does George have a nice ass?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.743
It... it was very white.

10:29.778 --> 10:32.512
It figures. I still don't
understand why he's having

10:32.547 --> 10:35.381
an affair
with his ex-wife

10:35.415 --> 10:37.549
it's like a waste of a divorce.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.985
I don't understand why he didn't
tell me he was seeing Priscilla.

10:40.019 --> 10:41.486
Why?
I don't tell you everything.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.488
<i>- You don't?
- No.</i>

10:43.522 --> 10:46.423
Oh, yes yes yes yes.

10:46.457 --> 10:48.258
Look at this.

10:48.292 --> 10:50.593
<i>My new drawing.</i>

10:50.628 --> 10:53.396
The origin of super ray.

10:53.430 --> 10:55.464
- So this is how he gets his powers?
- Yeah.

10:55.498 --> 10:57.499
Walks down the street
with his fly undone,

10:57.533 --> 10:58.900
falls through a subway grate,

10:58.935 --> 11:02.271
hits his cock
on the third rail,

11:02.305 --> 11:03.739
and it becomes a God.

11:03.772 --> 11:05.639
So the third rail
is to his cock

11:05.673 --> 11:08.042
what the spider bite
was to Peter Parker?

11:08.076 --> 11:10.177
Yeah, but this is
on a higher level.

11:11.446 --> 11:13.248
That's the general idea, yeah.

11:13.282 --> 11:15.817
Plus when Leah sees
the quality of my new work,

11:15.852 --> 11:17.586
she'll want me back.

11:17.620 --> 11:21.256
You know, I don't know
if that's gonna do the trick.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.857
I mean, she never
really liked comics.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.459
It'll work, okay?
I made a mix CD also.

11:26.493 --> 11:28.861
And between the mix CD
and the book,

11:28.895 --> 11:31.463
she'll know how much
I love her.

11:31.497 --> 11:33.231
When did you start
using that pipe?

11:33.266 --> 11:35.066
Uh, a couple of weeks ago,

11:35.100 --> 11:37.701
right after Leah sent
my heart to Darfur.

11:37.736 --> 11:40.936
Corn-cob pipe gets
you more stoned,

11:40.971 --> 11:43.038
plus it makes me
look like a sea Captain.

11:43.072 --> 11:45.707
I don't know what's worse...
Leah breaking up with you

11:45.742 --> 11:48.542
or Stella forcing me into bed
with her old boyfriend.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.710
But if you don't do it,
you'll lose her

11:50.744 --> 11:53.046
just like I lost Leah.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.715
I'm a chest of drawers.

11:54.749 --> 11:57.050
This drawer

11:57.085 --> 11:59.719
right here has been removed.

11:59.754 --> 12:01.588
Sorry, ray.

12:01.622 --> 12:03.222
It's okay.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.791
I'll win her back.
I have to.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.102
I can't believe
you were in the closet.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.571
I can't believe I had to listen
to you make love for 10 minutes.

12:19.605 --> 12:22.205
10... it was longer
than 10 minutes.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.241
Thank you. This is the best
part about having bedbugs.

12:25.275 --> 12:27.643
I may never move back to my apartment.

12:27.678 --> 12:29.679
You know the maritime
is a beautiful hotel,

12:29.713 --> 12:32.347
but the meat-packing district
really has become...

12:32.382 --> 12:35.650
- Los Angeles.
- So how was I last night in bed?

12:35.684 --> 12:37.618
<i>- Do I still got it?
- I don't know, George.</i>

12:37.652 --> 12:41.287
- I never saw you have sex before.
- True true.

12:41.322 --> 12:44.257
But Priscilla, God, she's
beautiful isn't she?

12:44.291 --> 12:46.392
Yeah, of course she's lovely,

12:46.427 --> 12:49.728
but what was all that
Nosferatu business?

12:49.762 --> 12:51.261
Oh.

12:51.295 --> 12:55.730
We like to do vampire role-play.
It's always been our thing.

12:55.764 --> 12:59.099
- God, is everyone into vampires?
- It seems that way.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.734
Oh, what's that?

13:00.768 --> 13:03.236
Two poached eggs
and an avocado.

13:03.270 --> 13:06.672
You know, avocado is the fish of
vegetables... a lot of omega-3.

13:06.707 --> 13:08.474
Oh, I want that.
Can we switch?

13:08.508 --> 13:10.809
This looks like very
very nice oatmeal.

13:12.245 --> 13:13.812
All right, fine.
Never mind.

13:13.846 --> 13:17.649
What the hell were you thinking
letting Antrem hire you?

13:17.683 --> 13:20.751
He was very pushy
and I needed the money.

13:20.786 --> 13:23.787
So very strange.
I mean I've had people watch, you know,

13:23.821 --> 13:26.489
back in the '70s
at Plato's retreat,

13:26.524 --> 13:29.124
but not when I didn't know.

13:29.159 --> 13:31.593
Well, you better call it quits.
I covered for you.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.528
Why?
What exactly did you say

13:33.562 --> 13:36.030
to that pompous, bloated toad?

13:36.064 --> 13:38.999
I told him she was alone, but
he wants me back in the closet.

13:39.033 --> 13:41.567
- Tomorrow night I'll be
back in there. - Fine.

13:41.602 --> 13:44.337
- Wednesday night.
- No, George, today is Wednesday.

13:44.371 --> 13:46.405
Oh, right right.

13:46.439 --> 13:50.108
<i>George, why are you having an
affair with your ex-wife?</i>

13:52.044 --> 13:54.712
Because I've never fallen
out of love with her.

13:56.848 --> 13:58.815
Are you sure
you don't wanna switch?

13:58.849 --> 14:00.849
Oh, of course you do.
Come on, come on.

14:00.884 --> 14:03.785
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

14:03.820 --> 14:06.421
Ah, bon appétit.

14:06.455 --> 14:08.456
Let's have a toast

14:08.490 --> 14:12.593
to my two favorite men
in the world.

14:12.627 --> 14:14.728
To my favorite girl
in the world.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.964
Mine too.

14:20.835 --> 14:23.703
You know, if you guys
just randomly met,

14:23.737 --> 14:25.838
you would be friends.
You know what I mean?

14:25.873 --> 14:28.441
- Sure, baby.
- "Baby."

14:33.581 --> 14:36.316
Just trying to keep it
symmetrical, you know.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.586
I'm gonna go light
some candles in the bedroom

14:40.620 --> 14:42.687
and get everything
all ready, okay?

14:42.722 --> 14:44.388
Sure, sweetie, sure.

14:54.765 --> 14:58.000
Oh, she's so sexy, isn't she?

14:58.034 --> 15:01.836
Yeah, I love that ass.
Doggy-style with her, right?

15:01.871 --> 15:03.973
- Listen...
- Yeah yeah,

15:04.007 --> 15:06.208
you're probably right.
No locker-room talk.

15:06.243 --> 15:09.477
So before we go to bed
I should know

15:09.511 --> 15:11.945
- are you bi or what?
- I don't think so.

15:11.980 --> 15:16.148
A camp counselor once fondled me
inappropriately, but that's about it.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.015
- Are you bi?
- I don't know.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.251
When I was 13, my best friend used
to put on his mom's wig and blow me.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.553
- Does that count?
- Maybe?

15:23.587 --> 15:27.123
- Yeah, whatever. So you're a writer?
- Yes, I've written one novel.

15:27.157 --> 15:29.658
Stella told me that your
second novel was rejected.

15:29.693 --> 15:33.128
- She did. Well... - Does that make
you feel like a one-hit wonder?

15:33.162 --> 15:35.429
Even though your one hit
wasn't really that big.

15:35.464 --> 15:37.764
Actually my first novel
was very well received.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.032
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:39.066 --> 15:41.201
Because I read a review
of your novel by Louis green.

15:41.235 --> 15:44.838
- Well, that guy's very biased.
- You're kind of a weak sister, aren't you?

15:44.872 --> 15:46.906
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

15:46.940 --> 15:50.609
Everything's ready. Do you guys wanna
come in and smoke some pot?

15:55.048 --> 15:56.848
Let's do this, little man.

15:59.952 --> 16:03.353
You know, I really wanna thank
you guys for doing this.

16:03.388 --> 16:05.322
I feel really loved right now.

16:05.356 --> 16:07.023
Oh, I'm happy too, baby.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.792
Do you think that we could rotate
the spooning in a little while

16:09.826 --> 16:12.727
so that I'm behind you, Stella?
I think that's fair.

16:12.762 --> 16:14.962
This is my apartment.

16:14.997 --> 16:17.197
- That's fine with me.
- No problem.

16:17.232 --> 16:20.133
But can you pull the plug on
that little kiddy nightlight?

16:20.167 --> 16:23.869
I like total darkness.
My circadian rhythms get all messed up.

16:52.633 --> 16:56.469
You know what?
I'm ready for more than cuddling.

16:59.072 --> 17:00.405
It was frightening.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.941
It was... it was like
an elephant tusk.

17:02.976 --> 17:04.910
I'm sorry you had to see that.

17:04.944 --> 17:07.545
I think I may have the
smallest penis in the world.

17:07.579 --> 17:09.578
I mean, first George,
which was bad enough,

17:09.613 --> 17:11.913
but then Warren
makes George look tiny.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.281
But you're just comparing
yourself to those two.

17:13.315 --> 17:14.781
- You don't have a small
penis, do you? - I do!

17:14.816 --> 17:17.184
I've been looking at it all morning.
I can't even see it.

17:17.218 --> 17:20.553
It's like I'm on top of the empire
state building and my penis is an ant.

17:20.588 --> 17:23.321
- You need to go to a doctor for something like that.
- Maybe, I don't know.

17:23.357 --> 17:25.790
I'm just really
going crazy right now.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.660
I'm committing menticide.

17:27.694 --> 17:31.563
- Menticide, what's that?
- My brain is attacking itself.

17:31.597 --> 17:33.998
Look...

17:35.868 --> 17:39.102
Can you please look at my penis
and tell me I'm an adult male?

17:39.137 --> 17:41.004
No!
What, are you nuts?

17:41.038 --> 17:44.240
Come on, Hemingway checked Fitzgerald
when he went through a crisis like this.

17:44.274 --> 17:46.008
He wrote about it
in "a movable feast."

17:46.043 --> 17:48.510
I'm your friend, but I'm not
gonna look at your cock.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.245
I don't care what
Hemingway wrote.

17:50.279 --> 17:52.213
Please?

17:53.482 --> 17:55.483
- What, here?
- Yes.

17:55.517 --> 17:57.651
- Now?
- Yes please.

17:57.686 --> 18:00.854
Okay.
Pull it out.

18:00.888 --> 18:03.323
- Well, I mean, not here here.
- Where do you want to do it?

18:03.357 --> 18:06.592
Because I'm not going to an alley.
I'm not gonna fall for that again.

18:08.228 --> 18:10.028
Make it quick, Fitzgerald.

18:10.062 --> 18:12.564
I really appreciate
you doing this.

18:17.168 --> 18:19.769
You're fucking crazy.
You're perfectly normal.

18:19.804 --> 18:22.905
- Really, you think so?
- Yeah, look at this.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.375
Oh my God, what is that?

18:27.409 --> 18:31.177
I have a long foreskin.
Not everybody in New York is Jewish, you know.

18:51.595 --> 18:53.061
Not again!

18:53.096 --> 18:55.096
<i>Okay, go down on me first.
Get me ready.</i>

18:56.331 --> 18:58.466
<i>Oh God, I love
licking your armpit.</i>

18:58.500 --> 19:00.634
<i>Oh George.</i>

19:03.237 --> 19:05.471
<i>Don't put your tongue in there.
I'll come.</i>

19:05.505 --> 19:09.274
<i>Oh, no no no, George.</i>

19:09.308 --> 19:12.577
<i>No no, George, no.</i>

19:27.358 --> 19:29.926
<i>I saw the color Violet
when I came.</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:31.761
<i>I saw
the color orange.</i>

19:34.364 --> 19:37.334
I forgot to turn my phone off.
I'm sorry.

19:37.368 --> 19:38.935
I won't answer it.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.675
George, I'm in the closet
and I need to come out!

19:46.709 --> 19:49.810
<i>I'll give you two minutes to get
decent and then I'm coming out.</i>

19:49.845 --> 19:51.679
It's an emergency.

19:51.713 --> 19:53.547
What?

19:53.581 --> 19:56.282
You remember Jonathan, right?

20:14.399 --> 20:17.600
<i>This is Leah.
Please leave a message.</i>

20:27.176 --> 20:29.343
You can come out now.

20:29.378 --> 20:32.246
George, I told you I was gonna
be in here on Thursday night.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.714
You knew he was
gonna be in there?

20:33.749 --> 20:36.317
I thought he was gonna
be in there Wednesday night.

20:36.351 --> 20:38.652
And it's not my fault.
Richard hired him.

20:38.686 --> 20:40.921
How could you forget
which night?

20:40.955 --> 20:43.890
I don't know. You know, I got
that vaporizer you told me about.

20:43.924 --> 20:46.825
I think my short-term memory
is going and my long term.

20:46.859 --> 20:48.926
We gotta go.
Antrem's gonna be back soon.

20:48.961 --> 20:51.529
- This is the most humiliating experience of my life.
- Sweetheart, come on.

20:51.563 --> 20:53.063
<i>Oh, just shut up.</i>

20:53.098 --> 20:55.899
<i>Sweee, my
flight got canceled!</i>

20:55.934 --> 20:57.301
Oh shit.

20:57.335 --> 20:59.035
What are we gonna do?

21:00.904 --> 21:03.038
Leah?

21:03.072 --> 21:06.174
- Leah?
- Who are you?

21:06.208 --> 21:08.746
- Who the fuck are you?
- Leah, call 911.

21:08.780 --> 21:10.480
Some nut has broken
into the house.

21:10.515 --> 21:12.549
Some nut? I'm her boyfriend,
you fucking asshole!

21:12.583 --> 21:14.417
I thought you guys broke up.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.356
- Irwin?
- Here.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.458
Ray?
What's going on?!

21:25.493 --> 21:27.160
Priscilla?

21:27.194 --> 21:30.028
I have something terrible
to confess to you.

21:30.063 --> 21:32.497
I thought that you were
cheating on me

21:32.531 --> 21:35.833
so I hired a private Detective.

21:37.469 --> 21:40.604
Jonathan, you can come
out of the closet now.

21:43.474 --> 21:45.842
Hello, Richard.

21:48.979 --> 21:52.013
Ray, stop.
Irwin, come back.

21:52.048 --> 21:54.315
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

21:54.350 --> 21:56.984
I'll just go home.
Thank you for a beautiful evening.

21:57.019 --> 21:59.420
Shut up, asshole.
You have a small cock.

21:59.455 --> 22:02.356
Because I'm frightened.
I'll call you tomorrow, Leah.

22:02.390 --> 22:04.290
Shut up.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.360
I can't believe this, ray.
Why are you here?

22:08.395 --> 22:10.629
Because I love you.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.530
What?
What did you say?

22:12.565 --> 22:16.033
I can't believe it.
It's only been three weeks and you do this?

22:16.068 --> 22:19.736
I'm sorry. He's just a guy I met.
I don't wanna hurt you.

22:32.848 --> 22:35.449
You're my best friend.

22:41.856 --> 22:44.057
You're cheating on me with him?

22:44.091 --> 22:47.258
How could you do that to me?
You know that I love you.

22:47.293 --> 22:48.759
Richard, I'm sorry.

22:48.794 --> 22:51.462
- But why? - Because I could
pretend that I was in the past

22:51.496 --> 22:54.131
when George and I were married,

22:54.165 --> 22:57.300
when I was young.

22:57.334 --> 23:01.203
Oh, r-Richard.
Don't be mad at Priscilla, please.

23:01.238 --> 23:03.773
It's my fault. I mean, yes,
we have an amorph...

23:03.807 --> 23:06.042
shut up, you old queen.

23:06.076 --> 23:09.344
And you? I thought
you were my new friend.

23:09.379 --> 23:11.078
Uh...

23:28.059 --> 23:29.559
- I'm sorry, Richard.
- Me too.

23:30.561 --> 23:34.330
<i>I'd like all of you
idiots out of the house.</i>

23:39.702 --> 23:41.769
Want to get a drink?

23:43.772 --> 23:45.639
Sure.
