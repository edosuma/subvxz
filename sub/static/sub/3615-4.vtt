WEBVTT

00:03.584 --> 00:05.899
PIPER:
All right, people, let's go--
 I was supposed to be

00:05.999 --> 00:07.275
at the club
a half an hour ago.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.899
Hey, are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

00:09.999 --> 00:11.609
I'm going to be
a very good witch

00:11.709 --> 00:12.899
from now on.
PRUE:
And you picked

00:12.999 --> 00:16.359
a role model who wears
lots and lots of pink.

00:16.459 --> 00:17.275
Yes.

00:17.375 --> 00:19.234
Glenda helped innocents,
didn't she?

00:19.334 --> 00:21.275
Yes.
You had the answer all along?

00:21.375 --> 00:22.859
That's not help,
that's mind games.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.900
I'm not going
to let you spoil

00:25.000 --> 00:25.692
my new attitude.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.899
I'm going to celebrate
the witches' holiday with...

00:28.999 --> 00:30.275
enthusiasm!
(<i>chuckles</i>)

00:30.375 --> 00:31.942
Yeah, the only problem is,
you never really know

00:32.042 --> 00:34.651
what you're celebrating
when you celebrate Halloween.

00:34.751 --> 00:36.734
Details! Where's Darryl?

00:36.834 --> 00:38.150
He's in the kitchen,

00:38.250 --> 00:39.109
on the phone.

00:39.209 --> 00:41.275
Hook-nosed hags
riding broomsticks--

00:41.375 --> 00:42.899
that's what
we're celebrating.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.734
Personally, I am offended
by the representation

00:45.834 --> 00:47.192
of witches in popular culture.

00:47.292 --> 00:49.192
Right. Which is
why you're dressed

00:49.292 --> 00:50.692
as the mistress of the dark?

00:50.792 --> 00:52.899
This costume happens to be
a protest statement.

00:52.999 --> 00:55.776
I am so impressed that you
can make a protest statement

00:55.876 --> 00:58.025
and show cleavage
all at the same time.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.109
Thanks.
Amazing.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.401
(<i>squeaky laugh</i>)

01:00.501 --> 01:02.484
Let's go!

01:02.584 --> 01:03.275
All right, Inspector,

01:03.375 --> 01:05.692
put down the phone
and nobody gets hurt.

01:05.792 --> 01:06.899
Yeah, sweetie,
I got to go.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.818
Give your folks
my love, okay?

01:08.918 --> 01:09.899
I miss you guys.

01:09.999 --> 01:11.899
Nice costume.

01:11.999 --> 01:13.899
Yeah, it's from
my rookie days.

01:13.999 --> 01:14.983
Still fits.

01:15.083 --> 01:16.542
Yeah, mine, too.

01:18.334 --> 01:21.751
Isn't that from World War II?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.818
Who are you?

01:25.918 --> 01:27.317
Uh... I'll explain

01:27.417 --> 01:27.899
on the way.

01:27.999 --> 01:30.900
So, in the meantime,
we can just stick together,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.734
since we are both dateless.

01:32.834 --> 01:33.900
He's not dateless, he's married.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.899
You're dateless
'cause you're picky.

01:35.999 --> 01:37.651
No. I'm not settling, all right?

01:37.751 --> 01:38.983
The perfect guy is out there,

01:39.083 --> 01:41.942
a real man,
and I will find him, trust me.

01:42.042 --> 01:43.067
Mm-hmm,
and they're going to love

01:43.167 --> 01:45.109
the popcorn and caramel
in your teeth, too.

01:45.209 --> 01:47.275
All right, Darryl,
let's go.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.567
Somebody, get something.

01:48.667 --> 01:49.899
Um, we can't leave yet.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.651
We have to wait for Cole.

01:51.751 --> 01:53.000
Cole Turner?

01:53.999 --> 01:55.292
The ADA?

01:55.999 --> 01:57.359
You're dating him.

01:57.459 --> 01:58.899
Uh, n-n-no.

01:58.999 --> 02:02.442
I just sort of invited him
to go along with us.

02:02.542 --> 02:04.484
It wasn't set in stone
or anything,

02:04.584 --> 02:06.776
but something must have come up.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.751
Uh-huh.

02:18.876 --> 02:19.734
Hey,

02:19.834 --> 02:22.292
hey, cool costumes, dudes.

02:22.999 --> 02:25.375
(<i>gasping</i>)

02:28.626 --> 02:30.999
What the hell are you doing?

02:32.042 --> 02:33.609
Belthazor?

02:33.709 --> 02:34.275
Uh-uh-uh.

02:34.375 --> 02:37.501
I use the name Cole here.

02:39.709 --> 02:41.375
Let him go.

02:44.334 --> 02:46.692
We don't need him.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.983
Not to get the Charmed Ones.

02:48.083 --> 02:51.899
My next question--
didn't they already get you,

02:51.999 --> 02:53.899
two years ago?

02:53.999 --> 02:54.899
Yeah,

02:54.999 --> 02:55.859
but it's Halloween--

02:55.959 --> 02:57.609
when the veil between
worlds thin,

02:57.709 --> 03:02.899
when the demons who know how can
return to seek their revenge.

03:02.999 --> 03:03.567
I know.

03:03.667 --> 03:07.484
Which is why I have a different
plan for the witches.

03:07.584 --> 03:09.275
One that doesn't include you.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.150
One that's been approved
by the Triad.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.150
We don't answer

03:13.250 --> 03:14.359
to anyone anymore.

03:14.459 --> 03:15.401
We're dead.

03:15.501 --> 03:18.484
There's dead...

03:18.584 --> 03:21.042
and there's dead.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.899
Fine.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.250
I'll just
move up my timetable.

03:33.250 --> 03:36.818
I've always hated that demon.

03:36.918 --> 03:38.792
Nice costume though.

03:40.250 --> 03:42.401
Ooh, ooh, I want a picture
of all of us first.

03:42.501 --> 03:44.234
But I have
to get my broomstick.

03:44.334 --> 03:45.067
ClichÃ©!

03:45.167 --> 03:46.401
(<i>doorbell ringing</i>)

03:46.501 --> 03:48.442
Come on you guys, hurry up!

03:48.542 --> 03:50.167
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

03:54.834 --> 03:55.401
Trick or treat.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.899
Oh, my God,
that is so weird.

03:56.999 --> 03:59.109
They look just like the Grim...

03:59.209 --> 04:00.150
Whoa!

04:00.250 --> 04:01.918
(<i>both yelling</i>)

04:07.209 --> 04:09.167
(<i>gasping</i>)

04:09.999 --> 04:11.025
Uh-oh!

04:11.125 --> 04:13.484
Uh-oh, what?

04:13.584 --> 04:14.899
Piper?!

04:14.999 --> 04:18.334
Prue? Phoebe!

04:19.459 --> 04:20.709
Oh!

04:21.999 --> 04:23.899
Didn't we vanquish them already?

04:23.999 --> 04:26.359
I don't know, but that's
not what I wanted
to warn you about.

04:26.459 --> 04:27.999
What do you mean?

04:28.501 --> 04:30.609
That's what I wanted
to warn you about.

04:30.709 --> 04:31.899
Oh...

04:31.999 --> 04:33.417
Oh, look out!

04:35.083 --> 04:36.692
Leo, what the hell is...

04:36.792 --> 04:39.083
(<i>all yelling</i>)

04:42.626 --> 04:43.567
Wait!

04:43.667 --> 04:46.999
They don't know
what's happening!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.375
This isn't good, right?

05:44.792 --> 05:47.250
(<i>screaming</i>)

05:57.292 --> 05:58.275
Is everybody okay?

05:58.375 --> 05:59.067
Too soon to tell.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.067
Did the Grimlocks
do this?

06:00.167 --> 06:03.192
Oh, unless we're dead
and this is the hereafter

06:03.292 --> 06:03.983
I don't think so.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.275
Eternally Elvira...
yecch.

06:05.375 --> 06:09.442
All right, uh, so this sort
of looks like an altar.

06:09.542 --> 06:10.484
A witch's altar.

06:10.584 --> 06:11.359
What's going on?

06:11.459 --> 06:12.776
(<i>horses whinnying</i>)

06:12.876 --> 06:14.109
RIDER:
There they are!

06:14.209 --> 06:15.734
Kill the witches!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.234
You had to ask!

06:17.334 --> 06:18.567
Not good, not good, not good.

06:18.667 --> 06:22.234
I believe we're
not in Kansas anymore!

06:22.334 --> 06:25.292
Hyah! Hyah!

06:26.292 --> 06:28.167
Come along!

06:30.999 --> 06:34.150
(<i>horses hooves pounding</i>)

06:34.250 --> 06:36.900
Over there!

06:37.000 --> 06:37.983
Look behind
those trees.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.859
Nothing here.
Come with me this way!

06:39.959 --> 06:42.067
Don't tell me we
time traveled again.

06:42.167 --> 06:42.818
I hate time traveling.

06:42.918 --> 06:45.234
<i>You</i> do? I was burned at the
stake last time, remember?

06:45.334 --> 06:48.359
All right, let's try and make
sure that doesn't happen again.

06:48.459 --> 06:49.401
From what
they're wearing,

06:49.501 --> 06:50.692
it looks to be what, uh...

06:50.792 --> 06:52.234
1600, 1700's.

06:52.334 --> 06:54.899
Where the life expectancy
of the average witch

06:54.999 --> 06:55.900
is what, 15 minutes?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.234
(<i>gasps</i>)

06:57.334 --> 06:59.083
RIDER:
Find anything, Micah?

07:02.584 --> 07:04.999
No, nothing here.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.025
Ride on.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.567
RIDER:
Ride on, men!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.751
Shh.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.899
Why didn't you let me

07:13.999 --> 07:14.401
freeze him?

07:14.501 --> 07:18.209
I don't know, there was
just something...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.359
Oh.

07:24.459 --> 07:25.899
Okay, you know what?

07:25.999 --> 07:27.859
I don't care why we're here,
or how we got here,

07:27.959 --> 07:28.609
I just want to get home.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.234
I've got a life to live,
and decorations to hang,

07:31.334 --> 07:32.776
so where is the damn vortex?

07:32.876 --> 07:34.859
I don't know where
the vortex...

07:34.959 --> 07:36.375
(<i>all screaming</i>)

07:37.626 --> 07:39.900
First demons I've ever seen.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.899
Actually, except for that blonde

07:41.999 --> 07:44.442
with the funky snake tongue
thingy.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.359
What are they?

07:46.459 --> 07:46.942
I don't know.

07:47.042 --> 07:50.484
Then how do you know they
didn't make the girls disappear?

07:50.584 --> 07:51.609
Because this is different.

07:51.709 --> 07:55.692
This is a time portal that my
bosses sent them through.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.983
Which is closed now, damn it!

07:58.083 --> 07:59.567
Who are you?

07:59.667 --> 08:01.375
I'm their...

08:02.375 --> 08:03.899
Never mind.
It's too complicated.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.899
I got to get you out of here

08:04.999 --> 08:06.899
before they unfreeze.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hold it.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.317
I'm not going anywhere.

08:08.417 --> 08:09.484
I don't have time to argue.

08:09.584 --> 08:10.329
I've got to figure out a way

08:10.339 --> 08:11.900
to get rid of these demons
before the girls return,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.526
otherwise they're going
to be sitting ducks.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.859
Are you sure
they're coming back?

08:15.959 --> 08:17.818
They better be.

08:17.918 --> 08:19.484
They got to do it before
Halloween ends, too.

08:19.584 --> 08:20.025
Which means...

08:20.125 --> 08:21.567
Which means you're going
to need my help.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.150
But you don't know what
you're up against here.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.078
The problem is neither do you,

08:25.088 --> 08:26.983
which means you're going
to need a cop around

08:27.083 --> 08:28.792
to help you figure it out.

08:29.751 --> 08:32.999
They're like sisters to me, Leo.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.192
All right.

08:35.292 --> 08:36.942
Phoebe said that she thought

08:37.042 --> 08:38.234
they had vanquished
these demons before,

08:38.333 --> 08:39.818
so the first thing
we have to do is...

08:39.918 --> 08:41.250
(<i>whooshing</i>)

08:42.375 --> 08:42.899
...run!

08:42.999 --> 08:44.959
(<i>growling</i>)

08:52.709 --> 08:54.501
Come on, let's go!

08:54.834 --> 08:57.899
(<i>groaning</i>):
At least we can't die.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.484
They can.

08:59.584 --> 09:02.900
We have to figure out
where the witches went.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.609
We know where they went.

09:05.709 --> 09:06.818
Cole got them.

09:06.918 --> 09:10.150
But if he fails,
they'll be back.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.375
And they'll be in our way.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.459
Blessed be.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.900
Our prayers have been answered.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.192
We need your help.

09:39.292 --> 09:40.109
Excuse me?
Forgive me

09:40.209 --> 09:41.818
for the manner in which
you were brought here,

09:41.918 --> 09:44.067
but we had to make sure
you were who we'd

09:44.167 --> 09:44.899
sent for.

09:44.999 --> 09:45.859
This doorway would have

09:45.959 --> 09:47.192
told us if you
were evil.

09:47.292 --> 09:49.275
Huh. Where can we get
one of those?

09:49.375 --> 09:51.899
All right, wait--
who do you think we are?

09:51.999 --> 09:57.167
The most powerful good witches
of all time of course.

09:58.584 --> 09:59.692
Okay, lucky guess.

09:59.792 --> 10:00.317
And you are...?

10:00.417 --> 10:01.899
I am Eva, a midwife, a witch,

10:01.999 --> 10:04.942
and a free citizen
of the colony of Virginia.

10:05.042 --> 10:05.983
These good women

10:06.083 --> 10:07.109
are my coven.

10:07.209 --> 10:07.899
Come.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.192
Now we don't have
much time.

10:09.292 --> 10:13.150
Take these.
No one can suspect that you've
come to us from the future.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.025
This is for you.
Witches must not

10:15.125 --> 10:17.317
have to hide in your time.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.899
What year are you from?

10:18.999 --> 10:21.167
Uh, 2000.

10:22.042 --> 10:23.899
What year is it now?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.109
1670.

10:25.209 --> 10:27.067
Oh.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.776
Uh, all right, so why do
you need our help?

10:29.876 --> 10:33.899
To save a magical baby
who's prophesied to be born

10:33.999 --> 10:34.899
tonight.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.150
Save it from who?

10:36.250 --> 10:37.109
A dark practitioner.

10:37.209 --> 10:38.899
She kidnapped the baby's mother

10:38.999 --> 10:41.109
in hopes
of raising the child evil.

10:41.209 --> 10:42.109
If that happens,

10:42.209 --> 10:43.692
good magic will never

10:43.792 --> 10:45.526
flourish in the New World.

10:45.626 --> 10:46.818
You must rescue Charlotte,

10:46.918 --> 10:49.275
so that you can bring her here
and we can deliver her baby

10:49.375 --> 10:50.776
within
our own protective circle.

10:50.876 --> 10:51.899
PIPER:
Wait a minute.

10:51.999 --> 10:52.734
You had the power

10:52.834 --> 10:53.454
to bring us through time,

10:53.464 --> 10:55.192
but you don't have the power
to set her free yourself?

10:55.292 --> 10:59.359
Well, we cast spells to prepare
your way, of course.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.734
But we know it was the power
of All Hallow's Eve

11:01.834 --> 11:03.942
that brought you here, not us.

11:04.042 --> 11:05.692
All Hallow's Eve?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.567
A witch's most sacred day.

11:07.667 --> 11:12.334
The day when the source
of all magic can be tapped into.

11:13.584 --> 11:15.899
How can you not know
about All Hallow's Eve?

11:15.999 --> 11:18.999
It isn't what
it used to be.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.442
Wait a minute. Uh...

11:21.542 --> 11:24.859
You can tap into that power
to send us home, right?

11:24.959 --> 11:27.999
W... We assumed <i>you</i> could.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.083
They assumed that we could.

11:31.584 --> 11:32.899
Um, okay, well, uh...

11:32.999 --> 11:33.899
Piper, I have an idea.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.025
So what time is it?

11:35.125 --> 11:36.067
It's two fif...

11:36.167 --> 11:36.899
fifteen.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.275
Oh, you've made
a big clock so small,

11:39.375 --> 11:41.959
you must possess
great magic.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.025
Just a good credit card.

11:44.125 --> 11:44.899
Okay, um...

11:44.999 --> 11:46.983
excuse us for a minute.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.899
Come on. Walk.

11:48.999 --> 11:49.401
All right...

11:49.501 --> 11:51.234
I think that I have
this figured out.

11:51.334 --> 11:52.899
I think that they
sent us here

11:52.999 --> 11:54.900
and that's what Leo
was trying to tell us.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.067
Oh, leave it to them
to zap first

11:57.167 --> 11:58.609
and give
instructions never.

11:58.709 --> 11:59.859
All right, but
if I'm right,

11:59.959 --> 12:00.734
the only way that <i>they</i>

12:00.834 --> 12:01.454
are going to
let us go home

12:01.464 --> 12:03.899
is if we bring that baby
back here by midnight.

12:03.999 --> 12:04.734
All right...

12:04.834 --> 12:07.317
uh, Eva,
do you have a plan?

12:07.417 --> 12:08.025
Yes.

12:08.125 --> 12:08.913
This vial holds a potion

12:08.923 --> 12:11.109
which will put the men
who guard the house

12:11.209 --> 12:12.442
to sleep.

12:12.542 --> 12:16.692
And then you'll use your powers
to bring the mother back here.

12:16.792 --> 12:17.526
Huh.

12:17.626 --> 12:19.776
Easy for her
to say.

12:19.876 --> 12:20.999
Oh.

12:28.334 --> 12:29.192
We must be careful.

12:29.292 --> 12:32.192
PHOEBE:
Looks like they're
having a party.

12:32.292 --> 12:33.899
It's the kidnapper,
Ruth Cobb.

12:33.999 --> 12:37.692
She's doing it pretending
to mock All Hallow's Eve,

12:37.792 --> 12:38.370
but I know better.

12:38.380 --> 12:42.083
She's really doing it to tap
into the powers of dark magic.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.109
Looks like our
welcoming committee.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.317
Witch hunters.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.234
Hunters of good witches, maybe.

12:51.334 --> 12:54.792
They work for Ruth.
They're after us.

12:57.501 --> 12:59.999
Not all of them.

13:01.959 --> 13:04.709
Hmm...

13:05.876 --> 13:08.083
Beware the talismans.

13:09.250 --> 13:09.899
They've barred our way

13:09.999 --> 13:11.484
each time we've tried
to rescue Charlotte.

13:11.584 --> 13:14.818
Oh, honey, those don't really
pack much of a punch

13:14.918 --> 13:15.859
where we come from.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.526
No, you don't realize...

13:17.626 --> 13:19.192
(<i>screams</i>)

13:19.292 --> 13:21.359
(<i>groans</i>)

13:21.459 --> 13:23.899
Witches!
There they are!

13:23.999 --> 13:26.234
(<i>bell ringing</i>)

13:26.334 --> 13:28.459
Ooh! What the hell was that?

13:29.125 --> 13:29.859
The talismans?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.983
No way talismans
have that much power.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.899
They never have before.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.876
Ruth's using the magic
of All Hallow's Eve.

13:36.999 --> 13:40.317
Guards!
All right, I got
'em, I got 'em.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.651
What just happened,
what's the matter?

13:42.751 --> 13:44.526
I don't know.

13:44.626 --> 13:45.899
Piper!

13:45.999 --> 13:47.025
(<i>screams</i>)

13:47.125 --> 13:49.275
Oh! Uh...

13:49.375 --> 13:50.442
Use your powers!

13:50.542 --> 13:51.567
We don't have any!

13:51.667 --> 13:53.275
What?!
Run!

13:53.375 --> 13:54.401
(<i>screams</i>)

13:54.501 --> 13:55.792
Oh, boy.

14:04.459 --> 14:05.317
(<i>shot fired</i>)

14:05.417 --> 14:08.442
It appears your witch friend
has brought others

14:08.542 --> 14:10.959
to try and rescue you again.

14:11.999 --> 14:16.818
Unfortunately,
she's been wounded.

14:16.918 --> 14:17.899
(<i>groans</i>)

14:17.999 --> 14:20.317
Oh, easy now, Charlotte...

14:20.417 --> 14:23.234
we wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to your baby,

14:23.334 --> 14:23.900
now, would we?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.567
I won't let you have my baby.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.899
Oh, you won't have a choice.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.899
Especially since somebody
very special

14:31.999 --> 14:35.125
has recently arrived
to ensure it.

14:46.417 --> 14:48.275
COLE:
How much longer, Ruth?

14:48.375 --> 14:49.192
Soon.

14:49.292 --> 14:52.150
By nightfall, perhaps.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.776
You imbued the talismans
with great power.

14:55.876 --> 15:00.192
Care to share your secrets?

15:00.292 --> 15:00.899
Who are you?

15:00.999 --> 15:03.359
Where do you come from,
pray tell?

15:03.459 --> 15:05.751
I come from the future...

15:08.999 --> 15:11.083
...to change it.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.401
Eva, we're sorry.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.818
We didn't know that
our powers weren't...

15:20.918 --> 15:21.899
Just leave us.

15:21.999 --> 15:24.899
Just go back to wherever it is
you came from.

15:24.999 --> 15:27.359
We asked for the most powerful
witches of all time

15:27.459 --> 15:29.317
and instead, we get
powerless frauds.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.317
PHOEBE:
Um, okay,

15:30.417 --> 15:31.818
I know you're
a little disappointed,

15:31.918 --> 15:35.083
but "frauds" is a little
harsh, don't you think?

15:35.999 --> 15:39.442
We do have powers, we just...
or at least we had them,

15:39.542 --> 15:40.899
we just can't access them

15:40.999 --> 15:41.609
right now.

15:41.709 --> 15:42.859
Maybe that's because
technically

15:42.959 --> 15:45.567
we don't really exist yet,
so neither do our powers.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.109
Protecting this baby
is my destiny.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.567
How can we come this far
just to fail?

15:51.667 --> 15:52.359
PHOEBE:
We're asking

15:52.459 --> 15:54.751
ourselves
the same thing.

15:55.751 --> 15:57.709
Bite down...

16:06.792 --> 16:08.899
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

16:08.999 --> 16:09.899
what are you doing?

16:09.999 --> 16:11.484
Cauterizing her wound.

16:11.584 --> 16:12.609
No, no, no, no, no...

16:12.709 --> 16:13.818
we may not have
our powers

16:13.918 --> 16:14.651
but we do have basics.

16:14.751 --> 16:17.401
Just get some hot water
and some soap

16:17.501 --> 16:19.484
and some clean cloths.

16:19.584 --> 16:22.000
Hurry.

16:22.999 --> 16:27.359
Eva, don't give up
on us yet, all right.

16:27.459 --> 16:28.109
I know that we can help.

16:28.209 --> 16:31.484
Yeah, we've been
through tougher jams
than this before.

16:31.584 --> 16:34.067
We have?
Haven't we?

16:34.167 --> 16:35.567
PRUE:
We were born witches.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.609
That makes us innately magical.

16:37.709 --> 16:38.899
Maybe you can just

16:38.999 --> 16:40.609
teach us how
to tap into it.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.567
There's not enough time.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.584
We're quick studies.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.484
LEO:
<i>I keep telling you, that
thing's not gonna work on them.</i>

16:52.584 --> 16:54.651
Maybe not but it makes them
think twice about it.

16:54.751 --> 16:56.900
Otherwise they would have
blasted in on us by now.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.234
Plus, it's the only
thing we got.

17:00.334 --> 17:00.942
And maybe not.

17:01.042 --> 17:02.900
I think I found out
who they are.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.898
"Grimlocks: underground demons
who are sensitive to light

17:06.999 --> 17:07.898
"and steal children's sight

17:07.999 --> 17:10.651
"so they can see the aura
that surrounds good people

17:10.751 --> 17:11.898
and strangle them with it."

17:11.999 --> 17:14.983
That snake-tongued blonde's
looking better and better.

17:15.083 --> 17:18.334
At least there's a
vanquishing potion here.

17:19.999 --> 17:22.709
We can't keep waiting here.

17:24.791 --> 17:28.709
We should be downstairs
waiting for the witches.

17:30.876 --> 17:34.083
We can't absorb
any more wounds!

17:35.292 --> 17:39.584
If they come into range...
we won't have to.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.192
(<i>coughing</i>)

17:49.292 --> 17:51.125
Darryl!

18:05.459 --> 18:06.899
(<i>coughing</i>)

18:06.999 --> 18:10.401
I told you you didn't know
what you were up against.

18:10.501 --> 18:12.359
Who are you?

18:12.459 --> 18:15.584
Come on, we got
a potion to cook up.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.734
(<i>groans</i>):
Ah...!

18:26.834 --> 18:28.484
The contractions are coming

18:28.584 --> 18:30.442
closer together.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.209
It won't be long now.

18:41.999 --> 18:43.401
Don't touch me.

18:43.501 --> 18:44.442
There's no need for you to be

18:44.542 --> 18:47.359
any more uncomfortable
than you have to be.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.275
Really?

18:50.375 --> 18:52.417
Then let me go.

18:53.792 --> 18:56.792
I beg you.

18:58.751 --> 19:02.359
Even if I could,
it wouldn't help.

19:02.459 --> 19:05.834
Another would be sent
to take you right back.

19:06.584 --> 19:08.109
(<i>gasps</i>):
Oh!
What?

19:08.209 --> 19:10.083
What do you see?

19:11.584 --> 19:14.150
A force of great good.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.900
From your time.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.899
Here for the baby as well.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.899
Three of them.

19:21.999 --> 19:22.496
I'm not surprised.

19:22.506 --> 19:25.999
My traveling here undoubtedly
alerted the other side.

19:27.209 --> 19:27.942
(<i>sighs</i>)

19:28.042 --> 19:28.859
But this new force...

19:28.959 --> 19:32.942
If it's who I think it is,
I can handle them.

19:33.042 --> 19:37.334
You just make sure she stays
here through midnight.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.192
Here.

19:45.292 --> 19:45.776
Dolls?

19:45.876 --> 19:47.109
We tap into our
powers with dolls?

19:47.209 --> 19:48.899
It's not just a doll,
it's a totem.

19:48.999 --> 19:51.983
It reminds us of the wisdom
and the power of women.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.442
Okay, but what does it
have to do with...

19:54.542 --> 19:56.734
The witch's journey
is a walk of wisdom

19:56.834 --> 19:58.899
collected over the years,
Phoebe.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.692
Wisdom gives us power.

20:00.792 --> 20:04.942
Power frightens
the fearful and the ignorant.

20:05.042 --> 20:07.734
Well, that would certainly
explain why, in our time,

20:07.834 --> 20:09.567
witches are made to look
silly on Halloween.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.899
And this magic,
this knowledge is forgotten?

20:12.999 --> 20:16.918
We could get it back
if you teach us.

20:17.709 --> 20:18.484
Here.

20:18.584 --> 20:22.899
The conical hat
is a spiritual point.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.734
It helps to channel
our magic...

20:24.834 --> 20:28.083
keeps us centered, focused.

20:29.999 --> 20:33.899
The apple holds a pentacle
in it's heart.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.442
Add a laurel leaf,

20:36.542 --> 20:38.150
you will block the path of evil.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.899
A simple laurel leaf?

20:39.999 --> 20:41.734
Simple, but powerful.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.609
Remember,
there is magic

20:43.709 --> 20:45.150
all around you.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.067
Especially on this night.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.192
Uh, what's with the masks?

20:49.292 --> 20:51.859
Demons walk freely
on All Hallow's Eve.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.899
So a mask allows you
to hide your identity...

20:55.999 --> 20:57.899
walk amongst them.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.999
Can I see that?

21:00.999 --> 21:04.734
Okay, now don't tell me
you ride around on this thing.

21:04.834 --> 21:05.859
(<i>chuckles</i>)

21:05.959 --> 21:08.609
Anything's possible.

21:08.709 --> 21:09.401
Here.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.899
The broom's
traditional purpose

21:10.999 --> 21:12.899
is to sweep evil
from your path.

21:12.999 --> 21:15.900
Sweep east to west,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.275
same path as
the sun travels.

21:17.375 --> 21:21.899
Like anything else in magic,
it's how you do it...

21:21.999 --> 21:24.834
with knowledge and reverence.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.359
Wow, do I feel silly.

21:28.459 --> 21:29.526
Ahh!

21:29.626 --> 21:30.484
What
happened?

21:30.584 --> 21:33.442
Nothing... must have been
just a spark.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.317
No.

21:34.417 --> 21:37.083
You felt the power.

21:38.209 --> 21:41.150
All right, Sally will go
with you to Ruth's house.

21:41.250 --> 21:44.067
She'll give you the last
few things you'll need.

21:44.167 --> 21:45.859
I wish I could go with you.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.275
We'll do great.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.275
You've armed us well.

21:48.375 --> 21:52.876
Remember, connect with
the power of this day.

21:55.999 --> 21:59.125
(<i>music and laughter</i>)

22:10.042 --> 22:12.109
Do you know
what they look like?

22:12.209 --> 22:13.192
What are you doing here?

22:13.292 --> 22:14.776
I told you to stay
at the house.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.899
Oh, the house is guarded
by men and magic.

22:17.999 --> 22:19.818
Charlotte's not
going anywhere.

22:19.918 --> 22:21.192
I've seen the future, Ruth.

22:21.292 --> 22:24.042
Your ignorance
is your destiny.

22:27.042 --> 22:28.942
Charlotte should be
in the first bedroom

22:29.042 --> 22:29.899
at the top
of the stairs.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.899
Be careful-- Ruth's
guards are everywhere.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.359
If they see you
with these tools,

22:33.459 --> 22:34.442
they'll know you
as witches.

22:34.542 --> 22:36.401
Don't worry,
we won't fail
this time.

22:36.501 --> 22:37.192
I know you won't.

22:37.292 --> 22:38.899
Which of you will
be standing guard

22:38.999 --> 22:39.899
for the others?
Phoebe.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.442
If need be, this will
turn away evil spirits.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.899
Perhaps even a demon
you think Ruth summoned.

22:44.999 --> 22:46.899
Um, you're
kidding, right?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.526
Okay, you're
not kidding.

22:48.626 --> 22:51.417
Blessed be.
Good luck.

22:52.209 --> 22:54.025
All right...

22:54.125 --> 22:55.818
trick or treat...

22:55.918 --> 22:57.484
Oh, boy.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.125
(<i>music continues</i>)

23:09.000 --> 23:11.417
Care to know
your future, my lady?

23:12.292 --> 23:13.025
Oh, no, thanks.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.150
(<i>chuckles</i>):
I'm pretty familiar
with it already.

23:16.250 --> 23:16.942
Are you certain?

23:17.042 --> 23:20.609
I can show you the
first initial of your
true love's name.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.692
Really? You can do that?

23:22.792 --> 23:24.609
With a simple peel
of the apple.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.292
COLE:
Prove it.

23:27.125 --> 23:30.899
And why would you
be interested, sir?

23:30.999 --> 23:33.334
And why wouldn't you be?

23:36.999 --> 23:38.918
Okay.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.999
How do I do it?

23:41.792 --> 23:43.484
First...

23:43.584 --> 23:44.899
you must fill your heart

23:44.999 --> 23:46.918
with only thoughts of love.

23:48.459 --> 23:49.776
Then close your eyes,

23:49.876 --> 23:52.025
and blow on the peel.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.401
(<i>exhales</i>)

23:53.501 --> 23:56.275
And drop the peel
into the water...

23:56.375 --> 23:57.484
and watch.

23:57.584 --> 24:00.859
And how is it that apple knows
this big secret?

24:00.959 --> 24:02.359
It's simple, my lady.

24:02.459 --> 24:05.999
Apples are the fruit
of knowledge.

24:10.209 --> 24:11.442
It is "C."

24:11.542 --> 24:14.999
The name of your true love
begins with a "C."

24:16.083 --> 24:18.417
Cole?

24:23.792 --> 24:25.751
Witch!

24:26.042 --> 24:27.501
Oh, no.

24:28.959 --> 24:29.899
Uh-oh.
Phoebe!

24:29.999 --> 24:32.067
Those two as well!

24:32.167 --> 24:33.899
Hey! Uh...

24:33.999 --> 24:34.776
There's your three.

24:34.876 --> 24:37.025
WOMAN:
Hang the witches!

24:37.125 --> 24:38.109
MAN:
Hang them!

24:38.209 --> 24:39.275
RUTH:
Hang them!

24:39.375 --> 24:40.567
Hang them all!

24:40.667 --> 24:41.067
My pleasure.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.359
WOMAN:
Take them from here!

24:42.459 --> 24:44.109
MAN:
Hang them!

24:44.209 --> 24:47.734
(<i>crowd clamoring</i>)

24:47.834 --> 24:49.999

Hang them!

24:56.501 --> 24:58.651

Come along.

24:58.751 --> 25:00.375
MAN 1:
Hang them!

25:08.999 --> 25:11.834
Tell me
this isn't happening.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.167
Hang, witch.

25:27.918 --> 25:29.626
Yah!

Yah! Yah!

25:34.999 --> 25:38.234

25:38.334 --> 25:39.999
Ride on!

25:41.292 --> 25:42.275
Yah!

26:06.751 --> 26:08.899
Ooh!
Ouch!

26:08.999 --> 26:09.609
My apologies.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.609
A little trick I learned
from the French.

26:11.709 --> 26:13.900
Run the noose line
to the waist.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.818
PHOEBE:
Yeah, well,
it's a really good thing

26:15.918 --> 26:18.899
the other guards
didn't see you do that.

26:18.999 --> 26:19.899
(<i>groans</i>)

26:19.999 --> 26:22.401
PIPER:
Wait a minute,
I don't understand.

26:22.501 --> 26:24.192
How did you know
you could trust him?

26:24.292 --> 26:27.401
By the look in his eyes.

26:27.501 --> 26:29.999
Oh. Uh-huh.

26:30.751 --> 26:32.526
So that would be...

26:32.626 --> 26:34.734
the second time

26:34.834 --> 26:36.109
that you've saved our necks.

26:36.209 --> 26:39.999
And what beautiful necks
they are.

26:41.999 --> 26:43.192
I'm Micah.

26:43.292 --> 26:45.792
I'm charmed.

26:45.999 --> 26:49.899
All right, I hate to
bust up the balcony
scene, Romeo,

26:49.999 --> 26:51.567
but why do you
keep saving us?

26:51.667 --> 26:54.609
And why are you running
with the witch hunters?

26:54.709 --> 26:58.651
So I can undo their work
whenever possible.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.626
I've seen what
dark magic can do.

27:02.209 --> 27:06.125
If you're fighting that,
I'm on your side.

27:07.542 --> 27:10.876
And I should get back
before anyone gets suspicious.

27:13.542 --> 27:14.899
Thank you.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.999
Another time.

27:19.918 --> 27:22.899
Who was that masked man?

27:22.999 --> 27:24.899
Hey, you finally
found a real man.

27:24.999 --> 27:27.899
Too bad he lives
in Colonial Virginia, Prue.

27:27.999 --> 27:30.150
We need to get out of here.
Pay attention.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.734
Okay, any idea how we're
gonna save the baby?

27:32.834 --> 27:34.567
Well, they think
we're dead now.

27:34.667 --> 27:38.067
They certainly aren't
expecting us.

27:38.167 --> 27:39.983
Right. Besides, you guys,

27:40.083 --> 27:42.899
we're witches, and it's
All Hallow's Eve, so...

27:42.999 --> 27:46.209
All right,
glow elsewhere.
All right.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.899
We need more thyme.

27:53.999 --> 27:55.776
Can't help you
there, buddy.

27:55.876 --> 27:56.899
It's almost nightfall.

27:56.999 --> 27:57.900
No, I'm talking
about an herb.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.209
It's for the potion.
It's, uh, over there.

28:04.709 --> 28:05.942
Thyme, right?

28:06.042 --> 28:07.567
Yeah.

28:07.667 --> 28:10.776
Do you think they know
what we're doing in here?

28:10.876 --> 28:11.899
Probably. It'd explain

28:11.999 --> 28:13.899
why they haven't
burst in on us yet.

28:13.999 --> 28:16.334
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

28:17.083 --> 28:18.899
Trick-or-treaters?

28:18.999 --> 28:19.734
Or a trap.

28:19.834 --> 28:22.734
Didn't you say those things
steal kids' sight?

28:22.834 --> 28:23.651
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

28:23.751 --> 28:25.442
No, I should go.
I can orb.

28:25.542 --> 28:27.899
Which might be exactly
what they're waiting for.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.567
Stay here and finish
that potion.

28:29.667 --> 28:30.370
No matter what happens,

28:30.380 --> 28:32.900
you make sure you bring
the girls home safe.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.667
(<i>chuckles</i>):
Whoever you are.

28:43.042 --> 28:44.401

Trick or treat!

28:44.501 --> 28:45.692
Spread the word:

28:45.792 --> 28:46.983
we're out of candy.

28:47.083 --> 28:47.899
Wow!

(<i>quiet gasping</i>)

29:20.250 --> 29:23.042
(<i>pained gasping</i>)

29:32.999 --> 29:34.692
I don't see Ruth
or the guards.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.025
What time is it?

29:36.125 --> 29:37.899
It's... it's 6:00.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.899
And we're running out
of time and magic.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.899
Yeah, well, it doesn't
change what we have to do.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.442
How are we gonna get past
the talismans?

29:43.542 --> 29:45.025
Do you remember
what Eva said?

29:45.125 --> 29:46.484
The "powerless frauds" part?

29:46.584 --> 29:48.150
No, the "magic is
all around us" part.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.899
Well, it's time
we learned how
to access that.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.899
To sweep away evil.
What, no funny hat?

29:53.999 --> 29:54.442
Lavender.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.109
Didn't she say that
was a protection herb?

29:56.209 --> 30:03.899
Yeah, and... the wisdom
of the women before us
will guide us again.

30:03.999 --> 30:07.234
Okay. Get sweepin'.

30:07.334 --> 30:09.375
(<i>groans</i>)

30:13.292 --> 30:15.109
Okay, which way is east?

30:15.209 --> 30:17.999
Uh... that way.

30:21.334 --> 30:23.776
Whoa! Did you see that?

30:23.876 --> 30:25.876
Yeah, keep going.

30:33.501 --> 30:35.067
(<i>whispers</i>):
It's working!

30:35.167 --> 30:36.651
All right, it's good.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.150
This is wrong.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.109
Micah!

30:39.209 --> 30:39.900
Prue!

30:40.000 --> 30:41.209
You can't.

30:41.918 --> 30:43.501
Wrong.

30:45.334 --> 30:46.899
They found him out.

30:46.999 --> 30:49.609
We have to get
to Charlotte.

30:49.709 --> 30:52.417
What would he want you to do?

31:02.167 --> 31:03.442
Hi.

31:03.542 --> 31:04.359
Who are you?

31:04.459 --> 31:05.692
Eva sent us.
Charlotte,

31:05.792 --> 31:07.442
we're here to
take you back.

31:07.542 --> 31:07.983
You're lying!

31:08.083 --> 31:09.109
I don't believe...

(<i>groaning</i>)

31:29.459 --> 31:32.442
How are you making
the pain go away?

31:32.542 --> 31:34.150
Uh, good magic.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.899
Just keep breathing.

31:35.999 --> 31:36.899
Good magic?

31:37.626 --> 31:39.359
Oh. Good idea.
All right, uh,

31:39.459 --> 31:41.651
we need to get
you out of here.

31:41.751 --> 31:43.567
Come on, honey.
It's okay.

31:43.667 --> 31:44.609

Oh! Oh!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.899
Oh, her water just broke.

31:47.999 --> 31:48.776
I see that.

Quickly!

31:56.083 --> 31:58.401
Check the house!
No.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.776
I know these witches.

32:00.876 --> 32:03.484
They've already
got Charlotte.

32:03.584 --> 32:04.899
Follow me.

32:04.999 --> 32:07.999
I know where they're going.

32:10.999 --> 32:11.859
The altar.

32:11.959 --> 32:14.776
PIPER:
Okay, just a little while
longer-- we're almost there.

32:14.876 --> 32:16.526
I can't! I'm sorry.
Yes, you...

32:16.626 --> 32:17.899
You can do this.
No!

32:17.999 --> 32:20.999
Charlotte...
The baby's coming now!

32:29.999 --> 32:32.067
PIPER:
Okay...
easy... easy.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.818
Um, it's almost 11:00.

32:33.918 --> 32:35.651
Do you think
they gave up on us?

32:35.751 --> 32:37.234
Uh...

32:37.334 --> 32:38.899
No, I don't think so.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.942
All right, what do we have?

32:40.042 --> 32:42.899
We got big problems and little
time and a little magic.

32:42.999 --> 32:44.359
All right, didn't Eva
say something about

32:44.459 --> 32:46.442
Charlotte giving birth
in a protective circle?

32:46.542 --> 32:47.359
Can we make one of those?

32:47.459 --> 32:49.359
I don't know.
We've got lavender and...

32:49.459 --> 32:51.734
Uh, isn't rosemary supposed
to be good for protection?

32:51.834 --> 32:54.317
Right, and apples
and laurel leaves
block the path of evil.

32:54.417 --> 32:56.401
Put it all together,
it may just work.

32:56.501 --> 32:58.334
(<i>Charlotte screaming</i>)

32:59.083 --> 33:00.734
Who's gonna deliver the baby?

33:00.834 --> 33:01.899
Personally,
I think you should,

33:01.999 --> 33:04.899
considering we know
that you're gonna have
one in the future.

33:04.999 --> 33:05.942
I second that.

33:06.042 --> 33:07.275
Wait a minute...

33:07.375 --> 33:08.484
(<i>Charlotte screaming</i>)

33:08.584 --> 33:09.442
(<i>stammering</i>)

33:09.542 --> 33:11.150
I always get
the messy jobs.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.192
All right, if ever
there was a time

33:12.292 --> 33:14.818
that we were going
to connect,
it needs to be now.

33:14.918 --> 33:15.899
So, Phoebe, form a circle.

33:15.999 --> 33:18.999
I'll work on the apples.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.999
MAN:
Over here!

33:28.876 --> 33:29.567
Okay,

33:29.667 --> 33:31.734
you're gonna have to try
to be kind of quiet.

33:31.834 --> 33:33.275
I know, I'm sorry.
okay?

33:33.375 --> 33:35.109
Um, don't worry.

33:35.209 --> 33:38.317
Everything is under control.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.442
(<i>panting</i>)

33:39.542 --> 33:40.401
Oh, my God!

33:40.501 --> 33:41.484
I see it!

33:41.584 --> 33:42.567
I see it!

33:42.667 --> 33:43.150
Really?

33:43.250 --> 33:43.899
Phoebe, the circle!

33:43.999 --> 33:47.234
Circle...
Okay, um, just...

33:47.334 --> 33:48.899
just try not
to push.

33:48.999 --> 33:52.234
Okay, uh,
this baby is coming!

33:52.334 --> 33:54.250
Yeah, well, so are they.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.899
Okay, we can do this.

33:56.999 --> 33:57.567
(<i>moaning</i>)

33:57.667 --> 33:59.692
PIPER:
Yes, we can do this.

33:59.792 --> 34:01.209
We have to do this.

34:02.209 --> 34:04.025
Knowledge and reverence...

34:04.125 --> 34:05.899
(<i>chanting together</i>):
Knowledge and reverence...

34:05.999 --> 34:07.109
knowledge and reverence...

34:07.209 --> 34:09.542
knowledge
and reverence...

34:12.125 --> 34:13.567
What are you doing?

34:13.667 --> 34:16.125
Seeing what they've learned.

34:20.417 --> 34:21.150
Here they come!

34:21.250 --> 34:21.942
Prue!

34:22.042 --> 34:22.525
(<i>moaning</i>)

34:22.626 --> 34:23.859
All right, now, all together.

34:23.958 --> 34:25.167
It's gonna work!

34:26.208 --> 34:27.501
Come on.

34:31.125 --> 34:33.042
Whoa... whoa... whoa...

34:33.667 --> 34:35.167
(<i>whinnying</i>)

34:37.000 --> 34:38.899
They've connected.

34:38.998 --> 34:39.900
It's over.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.942
No, not yet.

34:41.042 --> 34:43.998
How cool is that?
It actually worked.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.567
Oh... or not!

34:47.667 --> 34:49.542
PRUE:
It doesn't stop bullets!

34:50.292 --> 34:51.078
We are running out
of ammo!

34:51.088 --> 34:52.900
Prue, it's not like
an apple is gonna

34:53.000 --> 34:53.899
stop them anyway.

34:53.998 --> 34:54.900
Whoa!

34:55.000 --> 34:55.775
(<i>gunshot</i>)

34:55.876 --> 34:56.792
Oh!

34:57.292 --> 34:58.751
It's a girl!

35:02.751 --> 35:03.359
(<i>gunshot</i>)
Oh!

35:03.459 --> 35:04.734
PRUE:
Uh, Piper,

35:04.834 --> 35:07.317
get Charlotte
and the baby out of here.

35:07.417 --> 35:08.667
Huh?

35:09.459 --> 35:11.150
Okay, I think
I have an idea

35:11.250 --> 35:13.818
of what might
really scare them.

35:13.918 --> 35:14.609
What are you gonna do?

35:14.709 --> 35:18.999
I'm going to embrace
the clichÃ©.

35:21.999 --> 35:24.167
Ooh...

35:27.876 --> 35:30.584
There is something
you don't see every day.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.999
(<i>laughing</i>)

35:40.083 --> 35:42.999
(<i>whinnying</i>)

35:48.959 --> 35:49.899
(<i>laughing</i>)

35:49.999 --> 35:52.150
Gotta give them credit.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.834
They're awfully good.

35:56.959 --> 35:59.334
That's all right.

36:00.999 --> 36:03.292
Time's on my side.

36:35.959 --> 36:36.859
Ah, blessed be.

36:36.959 --> 36:38.692
Isn't the future beautiful?

36:38.792 --> 36:41.317
It is, thanks to you.

36:41.417 --> 36:42.899
You found the power.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.983
You showed us where to look.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.317
PRUE:
Yeah, I guess
we now know

36:46.417 --> 36:48.609
where all that flying hag stuff
started.

36:48.709 --> 36:51.192
You only have yourself
to blame, right, Pheebs?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.359
I know it and I love it.

36:52.459 --> 36:53.900
Now if I could
just figure out

36:54.000 --> 36:55.484
how to take it back
with me.

36:55.584 --> 36:57.067
Hey, what are
they waiting for?

36:57.167 --> 36:58.983
Why haven't they
sent us home yet?

36:59.083 --> 37:01.899
Maybe we haven't learned
everything that we're supposed

37:01.999 --> 37:02.818
to yet.

37:02.918 --> 37:03.899
Well, it's almost midnight,

37:03.999 --> 37:07.609
so if we're gonna learn
anything more, we better hurry.

37:07.709 --> 37:10.899
(<i>baby crying</i>)

37:10.999 --> 37:14.899
I promise my daughter
will know of you,

37:14.999 --> 37:15.942
of the three
powerful witches

37:16.042 --> 37:18.609
who came to bring her
into this world.

37:18.709 --> 37:21.417
And we'll always be grateful.

37:22.542 --> 37:24.501
Won't we, Melinda?

37:26.709 --> 37:27.609
Melinda?

37:27.709 --> 37:30.401
Yes, Melinda.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.501
Melinda Warren.

37:34.375 --> 37:35.899
What is it?

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
I, uh...

37:39.999 --> 37:42.709
I think we're related.

37:46.709 --> 37:47.959
Whoa!

37:48.125 --> 37:51.334
(<i>all yelling</i>)

37:52.375 --> 37:57.000
(<i>clock chiming</i>)

38:04.250 --> 38:07.250
I told you they'd come.

38:12.501 --> 38:13.083
Hey!

38:13.626 --> 38:15.709
(<i>screaming</i>)

38:25.999 --> 38:26.579
PRUE:
Hey, haven't I

38:26.589 --> 38:28.292
vanquished you
somewhere before?

38:29.999 --> 38:34.626
(<i>screaming</i>)

38:34.999 --> 38:36.375
LEO:
Are you guys all right?

38:36.999 --> 38:39.234
Are we all right?
Are you all right?

38:39.334 --> 38:40.899
It's been a long day.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.567
Yeah, tell us about it.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.025
Darryl?

38:44.125 --> 38:46.067
Prue?

38:46.167 --> 38:47.999
Uh...

38:49.042 --> 38:50.709
I got it.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.083
Open your eyes.

39:04.918 --> 39:06.918
Happy Halloween.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.899
âª All those years
you never knew âª

39:15.999 --> 39:20.899
âª All these things
that I could do âª

39:20.999 --> 39:24.234
âª I keep them
in a hidden place âª

39:24.334 --> 39:28.484
âª So I can rub them
in your face âª

39:28.584 --> 39:31.899
âª Breed âª

39:31.999 --> 39:35.818
âª Breed on your own âª

39:35.918 --> 39:39.899
âª Always alone âª

39:39.999 --> 39:44.999
âª You suffering clone âª

39:47.626 --> 39:50.234
Use that broom with reverence.

39:50.334 --> 39:50.899
Hey...

39:50.999 --> 39:56.692
Halloween is now officially
my favorite holiday.

39:56.792 --> 39:56.995
Who knew?

39:57.005 --> 39:58.899
We didn't...
but we should have.

39:58.999 --> 40:03.459
So much knowledge,
so much power that we've lost.

40:03.999 --> 40:04.983
But we'll get it back.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.567
Okay, well, one crash course
at a time.

40:06.667 --> 40:10.275
Yeah. It's too bad
Darryl didn't feel up
to celebrating with us.

40:10.375 --> 40:10.899
He saw a lot today.

40:10.999 --> 40:13.859
I think he needs
some time to sort
it all out.

40:13.959 --> 40:14.651
PRUE:
Yeah, well, so do we.

40:14.751 --> 40:17.359
I mean, it's bad enough
that the Triad wants us dead,

40:17.459 --> 40:20.234
but to send someone back
to wipe out our whole line?

40:20.334 --> 40:22.609
Do your bosses have any clue
who it is?

40:22.709 --> 40:23.983
None that they're sharing.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.899
I think it was that guy who was
hitting on Phoebe

40:26.999 --> 40:28.234
at the party.
Hang on.

40:28.334 --> 40:30.401
Not every guy I meet wants
to kill me.

40:30.501 --> 40:31.899
Maybe he just

40:31.999 --> 40:33.667
liked me.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.109
Well, you saved Melinda.

40:35.209 --> 40:36.317
And that's all
that matters.

40:36.417 --> 40:39.776
And I helped to deliver
our great- great- great-

40:39.876 --> 40:42.442
great- whatever
great-grandmother.

40:42.542 --> 40:44.609
Too bad we couldn't save her
from moving

40:44.709 --> 40:45.692
from Virginia to Salem.

40:45.792 --> 40:46.734
That would have been nice.

40:46.834 --> 40:49.025
Yeah, well, you can't
change history.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.484
For better or worse.

40:50.584 --> 40:51.999
Excuse me?

40:52.751 --> 40:53.899
Hi.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.942
Micah?

40:55.042 --> 40:56.899
Mitch actually.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.401
Forgive my directness

40:58.501 --> 41:00.899
but I've been watching you

41:00.999 --> 41:02.667
from across the room.

41:04.667 --> 41:05.899
Have we met?

41:05.999 --> 41:07.651
You know, that's funny.

41:07.751 --> 41:11.584
I was going to ask you
the same thing. Um...

41:12.834 --> 41:14.626
(<i>laughing</i>)

41:19.334 --> 41:20.899
Oh...

41:20.999 --> 41:22.375
my turn.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.109
Hey.

41:30.209 --> 41:31.109
Hey.

41:31.209 --> 41:34.275
I was beginning to think
I got stood up.

41:34.375 --> 41:35.484
Yeah, sorry.

41:35.584 --> 41:36.150
Work, you know.

41:36.250 --> 41:38.983
I guess I just lost track
of time.

41:39.083 --> 41:39.818
That's okay.

41:39.918 --> 41:42.209
I got kinda hung up myself.

41:46.542 --> 41:49.626
So, you're an angel?

41:51.209 --> 41:52.692
Oh, uh, this?

41:52.792 --> 41:53.999
(<i>laughing</i>)

41:55.999 --> 41:59.918
No, not really.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.834
That's okay.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.876
Neither am I.
