I was very brave when the doctor
gave me that shot,

00:37.805 --> 00:38.971
wasn't I, Lois?

00:38.973 --> 00:40.706
Yes, Peter, you
were very brave.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.008
Even when I knew that he was
gonna give me the shot,

00:43.010 --> 00:45.110
I just k-kept looking
at him in the eye

00:45.112 --> 00:47.146
and talking to him
about my summer plans.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.447
You did very good.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.948
See, Peter? It
wasn't so bad.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.850
Yeah, except for
having to sit next to

00:51.852 --> 00:54.019
that screaming autistic lady
in the waiting room.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.833
I don't know what you want!
I don't know how to help!

01:08.802 --> 01:09.968
Hi, there. Excuse me.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.371
I seem to be lost.
Can you guys help me?

01:12.373 --> 01:13.705
Oh, my God.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.107
Are you Ryan
Reynolds?

01:15.109 --> 01:16.875
From <i>The Proposal</i>
<i>and</i>    <i>The Change-Up</i>

01:16.877 --> 01:19.044
and a ton of upcoming stuff?
Yeah, that's me.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.647
I was on my way to Newport
and I kind of got turned around.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.516
Of course, Mr. Reynolds, we'd be
happy to give you directions.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.485
You take 138
to the Jamestown Bridge,

01:26.487 --> 01:27.920
and you're gonna follow the...

01:27.922 --> 01:28.987
There's a fire truck.

01:28.989 --> 01:29.955
Yes, I see it, Peter.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.190
It's a fire truck.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.925
And after the bridge,
just follow the signs.

01:32.927 --> 01:33.959
Thanks.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.360
Hey, what happened
to your arm?

01:35.362 --> 01:38.030
I just went to the doctor,
got my cholesterol checked.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.765
Wow, why does a
guy in his 20s

01:39.767 --> 01:41.200
need to get his
cholesterol checked?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.768
Oh, come on, now.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.436
Oh, hey, I never
got your name.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.604
Uh, Peter.
Peter Griffin.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.605
And I'm Lo...

01:46.607 --> 01:48.207
Catch you
later, Peter.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.342
Wow, he was really nice.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.178
Not like when I met
that bitch Shelley Duvall.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.647
Hi, I'm
Shelley Duvall.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.849
Very nice
to meet you.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.083
Big (bleep) deal.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.919
Came right up to me, like
I was just dying to meet her.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.988
Peter, you're gonna
have to let that one go.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.527
(doorbell rings)

02:08.529 --> 02:10.963
Hi, Mrs. Janetti.
I'm here to pick up Stewie.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.499
Oh, sure, Brian. He's in
the playroom with Gavin.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.001
Gavin-- that's
a stupid name.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.769
And nobody likes you
at school.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.471
You're gonna be ugly
when you grow up.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.173
And everything
in your house is cheap.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.774
And it smells in here.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.009
Oh, hey, Brian.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.077
Bye!

02:28.381 --> 02:29.515
That was fun.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.116
I like Gavin.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.951
Oh, yay!
This is such a great song.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.288
Really?
Yeah, really.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.490
I don't have to defend
Carrie Underwood to you.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.893
She is doing
just fine without you.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.199
Brian, I'm just going to sit
in the car till the song's over.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.368
All right, but don't take too
long; it'll drain the battery.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.436
Oh, shut up.
It's not draining the battery.

11:45 and the lights are on.

Ew, and gross!

Peter, just
leave him alone.

No, this is
what Bob Barker's been

03:44.491 --> 03:47.125
talking about all these years.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.126
Go on! Get!

weird boner dog!

Hey, look who it is!

03:53.100 --> 03:54.333
Hey, Ryan Reynolds.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.867
What are you doing
in Cleveland's house?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.703
Well, believe it or not,
they've decided

03:57.705 --> 04:00.138
to shoot my movie
in Quahog instead of Newport.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.708
I'm playing Hitler,
but he's a young Hitler

04:02.710 --> 04:04.443
and he's got a rocking body.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.544
It's called <i>Hotler.</i>

04:05.546 --> 04:07.846
Ha! Color me seven
bucks lighter.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.915
Hey, I'm so excited
that we're gonna be neighbors.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.983
We should totally hang out.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.517
Yeah, that'd be great.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.087
Okay, I'm embarrassed.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.089
I'm standing out here
without a shirt on

04:17.091 --> 04:20.425
and my pajama bottoms are
riding insanely low on my hips.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.194
Hey, how much
money you make?
(chuckles)

04:22.196 --> 04:23.996
You'd think enough
for a shirt, right?

04:23.998 --> 04:24.997
(laughs)

04:24.999 --> 04:26.698
So I'm having this
housewarming thing tonight,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.433
and I'd love it
if you came by.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.868
Yeah, that
sounds great.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.070
Anything beats what goes on
at my house Friday nights.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.640
Hey, Lois, what's
going on here?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.141
Oh, it's my book club, Peter.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.142
Come join us.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.343
Oh, okay!

04:38.345 --> 04:39.878
(neck cracks)

04:44.951 --> 04:48.420
All right, let's see,
new novel, new novel, new novel.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.089
What's it about?
What's it about?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.624
A guy...

04:52.626 --> 04:55.027
a guy who loses everything,

04:55.029 --> 04:58.797
but finds his soul
in Canada.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.532
All right,
we're cooking now.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.633
Cooking now.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.202
And the whole book
is an e-mail

05:04.204 --> 05:07.539
to his daughter,
who's dead.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.008
And his name
will be Norm Hull.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.177
Because he's just
a normal guy.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.879
But not everybody
will get that.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.415
That's just for the scholars
a hundred years from now.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.084
Okay, Rupert,
you ready to go for a drive?

05:33.533 --> 05:35.967
Oh, my God, Rupert,
this is such a thrill.

05:35.969 --> 05:36.935
Look at me, I'm driving!

05:36.937 --> 05:38.603
I'm driving a real car!

05:38.605 --> 05:39.938
I don't believe it!

05:39.940 --> 05:41.707
Well, I'd say we need
to put on some tunes.

05:41.709 --> 05:45.110

Weenie and The Butt on 97.1.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.045

listen to.

05:50.084 --> 05:53.585

Bieber featuring Ludacris,

05:53.587 --> 05:56.655

away some Justin Bieber tickets.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.823

06:01.962 --> 06:04.129
You know what I should do,
just, like, as a goof?

06:04.131 --> 06:06.998
I should try to win those Justin
Bieber tickets just so I can,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.634
like, tear them up or use them
to go to the concert.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.336

Oh, it's ringing, Rupert,
it's ringing.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.706

they're celebrities.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.941
You talk to them.

Stewie screams)

06:26.185 --> 06:27.786
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

much trouble.

Justin Bieber!

Oh, sweet Jesus!

06:35.095 --> 06:37.162
Yes! Jesse, I won!

06:37.164 --> 06:39.097
Never say never!

06:42.268 --> 06:44.269

06:54.614 --> 06:56.014
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.983
Oh, my God, Brian's gonna be
so mad at me.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.985
What am I gonna do?
Okay, it's all right.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.988
I'll just get a little bit of
paint and cover up the dents.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.023
Unattractive women
do it all the time.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.658
You look pretty
today, Carol.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.859
Thanks.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.128
It's probably just
the dress and the makeup.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.663
Ah, now that
I look closer,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.598
yeah, I think that's
what it is, too.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.470
Hey, you made it!

07:18.472 --> 07:19.805
And you brought
a friend.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.806
Great.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.007
I'm his wife, Lois.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.608
We actually met the other day.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.444
Oh, sorry,
I-I meet so many people.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.479
But there's really no way
you could know that.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.847
Yeah, she's a housewife,
she don't know.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.848
Whatever.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.850
You got booze
in here?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.985
Is it me, or did she
just make that weird?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.754
Please. It was
definitely not you.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.988
Hey, is this
shirt too tight?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.023
I'm feeling really
self-conscious.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.491
No, not at all.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.460
So it-it looks
good like this?
Yeah, it looks good.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.461
Thanks.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.962
Now I don't know
what to say.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.163
Hey, I got, I got, like,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.098
an insider Hollywood
question for you.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.935
Is, um, is "L.A."
short for something?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.603
Ha! You're a riot.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.472
Hey, hey, so what's
all this about,

07:53.474 --> 07:55.540
everyone in Quahog
likes to tickle fight?

07:55.542 --> 07:56.842
What is that?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.143
What? I never heard that.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.678
Yeah, apparently
it's, like, a thing.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.979
It is?
Yeah.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.914
I mean, they also said
that people who pretend

08:02.916 --> 08:04.616
not to have heard
of it are chicken.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.117
Well, I ain't no chicken.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.853
One-nothing!
(laughing)

08:07.855 --> 08:08.954
No, two-nothing!

08:08.956 --> 08:10.489
(both laughing)

08:10.491 --> 08:11.490
Three-nothing!

08:11.492 --> 08:13.124
Fight over!
Fight over!

08:13.126 --> 08:15.093
Wow, you got a lot
of catching up to do,

08:15.095 --> 08:16.661
and tomorrow night
in the dark, huh?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.662
In the dark?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.997
Yeah, if you say so.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.665
Just don't tickle me
in my lower abdomen.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.133
I'm super
ticklish there.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.102
<i>Lower abdomen.</i>

08:24.104 --> 08:26.471
<i>You're gonna wish</i>
<i>you never said that.</i>

08:26.473 --> 08:28.707
This might be
totally off the wall,

08:28.709 --> 08:31.943
but are you doing
anything Thursday night?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.478
You probably have
plans, anyway.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.913
You know what...
(stutters)

08:34.915 --> 08:36.281
Forget it, forget
it, forget it.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.949
Blah. Nervous.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.117
(chuckles)

08:39.119 --> 08:41.119
You know, Ryan,
most people take one look at me

08:41.121 --> 08:44.089
and just assume that I have
plans, so I never get asked out.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.925
But I-I frequently
don't have plans, so yes,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.960
I would love to do something
with you on Thursday night.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.863
Yes! Oh, my God, right now
would be the worst time

08:51.865 --> 08:53.465
for you to tickle
my lower abdomen,

08:53.467 --> 08:55.634
because it's so exposed
'cause I'm cheering.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.435
Yeah, Thursday night!

08:57.437 --> 08:59.704
Aw, your big mouth
just got you in trouble.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.939
(laughing)
Aw, I lose.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.607
Peter one, you zero.
Oh, I lose again.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.376
Peter two, you zero.
You've been practicing.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.315
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to the end of
a depressing 1970s sci-fi movie

09:10.317 --> 09:12.250
starring a guy in a turtleneck.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.152
(panting)

09:14.154 --> 09:15.921
We've gone far enough.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.490
I think we're safe from
The Corporation here.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.058
Adzin, look!

09:30.202 --> 09:32.971
It can't be.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.606
No!

09:34.608 --> 09:37.142
We'll never defeat
The Corporation!

09:37.144 --> 09:38.777
They've won!

09:38.779 --> 09:40.545
There is one way, Adzin.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.980
You can shoot yourself.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.984
If it's the only
way, I must.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.353
(laser blast)

09:51.924 --> 09:54.993
(eerie synthesizer music plays)

10:08.808 --> 10:10.141
BRIAN:
What the hell?!

10:10.143 --> 10:12.544
Stewie, get out here!

10:12.546 --> 10:14.379
Look at this.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.780
Do you know anything
about this?

10:15.782 --> 10:16.781
A-About what?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.183
About what
a beautiful day it...

10:18.185 --> 10:21.252
Oh, my God,
that is surprising.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.688
Oh, I had to stop that
last sentence in the middle

10:23.690 --> 10:24.990
because I was so surprised.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.691
What happened?
Gee, I don't know.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.859
Do you know
what happened?

10:27.861 --> 10:28.927
(laughs)

10:28.929 --> 10:29.928
I'm sorry, w-what was that?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.696
I-I was laughing
at that funny thing

10:31.698 --> 10:33.098
you said at dinner
the other night.

10:33.100 --> 10:33.932
What funny thing?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.635
Um, y-you remember
what you said

10:36.637 --> 10:39.204
about Lois's, um,
"potatoes au rotten"?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.940
Huh. Didn't think
anybody heard that.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.141
Wish you'd laughed
at the time.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.876
W-What the hell
happened to my car?!

10:44.878 --> 10:47.012
Well, I don't know, man,
but the good news is,

10:47.014 --> 10:49.014
it-it doesn't look
all that bad, Brian.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.449
It's just,
it's that spot right there

10:51.451 --> 10:52.784
that's upsetting you, right?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.986
Stewie, I know it was you.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.026
Your potato joke
was terrible.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.028
I can't believe
you drove my car!

11:03.030 --> 11:04.496
You could have
gotten yourself killed!

11:04.498 --> 11:06.297
I'm gonna have to tell
Peter and Lois.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.699
No! No, you can't tell them!

11:07.701 --> 11:09.134
I'll be in so much trouble!

11:09.136 --> 11:10.101
Stewie, I have to.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.770
All right,
I have covered for you

11:11.772 --> 11:13.471
plenty of times before,
but not this time.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.673
This is very dangerous,

11:14.675 --> 11:17.142
and I have to make sure
you never do it again.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.209
I won't, I swear!

11:18.211 --> 11:20.278
(crying)

11:22.682 --> 11:24.649
Stewie, calm down.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.852
Sometimes in life you just have
to accept what's coming to you.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.854
Like the contestant
who gets the lesser showcase

11:29.856 --> 11:30.989
on   <i>The Price is Right.</i>

11:30.991 --> 11:33.124
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Lindsay, your showcase

11:33.126 --> 11:35.293
is all about relaxation.

11:35.295 --> 11:40.198
And what better place to relax
than in your brand-new hammock?!

11:40.200 --> 11:43.134
This sturdy and portable hammock
from Swingway turns any patio

11:43.136 --> 11:45.503
into a tropical paradise.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.106
And you can entertain yourself
on your patio

11:48.108 --> 11:50.108
by drawing with chalk!

11:50.110 --> 11:52.711
Yes, Pratt and Millwood
eight-color pastel chalk

11:52.713 --> 11:55.947
will turn your patio
into a tropical art studio.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.649
But you'll have
to pack your chalk

11:57.651 --> 11:58.983
because you're going
to be staying

11:58.985 --> 12:00.618
six days and seven nights

12:00.620 --> 12:04.122
at your parents' house
in Wilmington, Delaware!

12:04.124 --> 12:07.158
I moved my abortion for this.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.429
♪

12:13.165 --> 12:16.868
Um, hey, thanks for taking
me out to dinner, Ryan,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.604
but I got to say, this
food looks a little weird.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.372
Aw, Peter, Moroccan food
is the jizz.

12:21.374 --> 12:25.110
I don't know. Looks like it
might give me the kind of farts

12:25.112 --> 12:26.611
I get from eating
Mexican food.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.413
(farts)

12:28.415 --> 12:33.918
<i>Con cuidado</i>
<i>es el stinko!</i>

12:33.920 --> 12:35.687
(gunfire, all screaming)

12:35.689 --> 12:37.155
Hey, do these pants
look all right?

12:37.157 --> 12:40.024
Sometimes I put them on, and
I'm thinking I look all balls.

12:40.026 --> 12:40.992
No, I think you're good.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.460
You think my balls are good?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.095
(laughing):
You're so weird.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.363
It's awesome, though.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.031
Oh, I... I don't know.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.099
Hey, have you noticed

12:48.101 --> 12:50.368
what a jerk the mailman is
in this town?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.670
Like, he said
there is no way

12:52.672 --> 12:54.773
Peter Griffin
could crush a baby bird

12:54.775 --> 12:56.541
with his bare foot
while I watched.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.377
That guy talks
more crap about me.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.013
Mmm! Oh!

13:02.015 --> 13:04.115
Mmm. You got to taste
this lamb tagine.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.617
Mmm. Here.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.985
No, that... no,
that's okay.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.119
Come on, you'll love it.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.320
Eh...

13:09.322 --> 13:10.655
Just a taste.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.056
(coughing)

13:17.096 --> 13:18.429
(coughs, clears
his throat)

13:18.431 --> 13:21.833
That was... intense.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.101
What you just did.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.302
(coughs, clears throat)

13:24.304 --> 13:26.004
Lots of...

13:26.006 --> 13:27.305
Lots of flavors.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.773
Whoops.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.042
Whoa, freeze frame!

13:31.044 --> 13:32.811
What's gonna happen next?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.946
I think I got to
go to the bathroom.

13:35.915 --> 13:36.915
(farts)

13:36.917 --> 13:38.650
(shouting in
foreign language)

13:38.652 --> 13:40.018
(couple yelling)

13:44.590 --> 13:45.790
What am I gonna do?

13:45.792 --> 13:47.325
I'm gonna be in so much trouble

13:47.327 --> 13:49.160
when they find out
I wrecked Brian's car!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.962
They'll probably ship me off
to Siberia.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.097
This sucks.
I hate it here.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.132
Shut up.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.035
Drink wolf milk and
watch Russian cartoons.

13:57.037 --> 14:01.005
MAN WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT (on TV):
We now return to popular Russian
cartoon, <i>Shoe and Shoelace.</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:02.340
ANNOUNCER 2:
Shoe and Shoelace!

14:02.342 --> 14:04.142
One is meaningless
without the other!

14:04.144 --> 14:06.211
(recording of the Russian
National Anthem plays)

14:10.149 --> 14:11.649
Well, that's it.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.984
I have no choice.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.753
I've got to run away.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.159
(sighs)

14:21.161 --> 14:23.027
Guess I'm on my own now, Rupert.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.629
It could be worse, though.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.130
At least I'm not getting stabbed

14:26.132 --> 14:28.132
by some random guy
on the street.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.934
(thunderclap, wind howling)

14:29.936 --> 14:31.870
See? It's the exact opposite.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.938
Oh! It happened anyway!

14:39.378 --> 14:41.546
Hey, Stewie, you up?

14:43.282 --> 14:45.350
What the...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.287
Brian, I've decided to run away.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.655
Don't come looking for me.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.091
And definitely don't chase me
to the airport

14:53.093 --> 14:54.425
and catch me at the gate

14:54.427 --> 14:56.594
just before I'm about
to get on the plane

14:56.596 --> 14:58.696
with, like, an emotional speech
and possibly flowers.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.031
For example, it would be awful

15:00.033 --> 15:02.367
if all the TSA people were
gathered around,

15:02.369 --> 15:03.935
watching this emotional moment,

15:03.937 --> 15:06.104
even the older black female
carry-on scanner

15:06.106 --> 15:08.373
who initially stopped you
at the baggage check,

15:08.375 --> 15:11.109
but who after you told her
of your intentions, said,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.344
"Go get him, child,"
in flagrant disregard

15:13.346 --> 15:16.681
of all newly-implemented
post-9-11 security measures.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.983
And if you were considering
bringing a boom box

15:18.985 --> 15:22.420
to play music, I would suggest
any one of these six songs.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.092
So again, ran away.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.527
Don't come after me.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.998
DIDO:
♪ I want to thank you...

15:37.970 --> 15:40.338
Dirty whores, all of you.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.940
Oh, hey, Peter.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.374
Lois, we got a problem.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.877
I think Ryan Reynolds
is in love with me.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.012
What? Don't be ridiculous.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.814
It's true. Last night we were
at this restaurant,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.115
and he tried to gay kiss me.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.117
I'm telling you,
he wants to get with me.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.452
Peter, come on.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.121
Why would any man dress well,
groom himself and lift weights

15:57.123 --> 15:58.823
just to sleep with other men?

15:58.825 --> 15:59.991
He's not gay.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.593
Well, I don't care what you say.
He likes me.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.696
And we do have chemistry,
I-I won't deny that.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.431
I-I... I will take
responsibility

16:06.433 --> 16:07.999
for my part in this.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.335
I'm just gonna go over there
and let him down easy.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.105
Oh, Snooki died.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.042

Oh, my God, Rupert!

16:24.150 --> 16:26.084
We've got to get out of here!

16:27.086 --> 16:28.086
Aah! Damn it!

16:28.088 --> 16:29.354

Oh, no, no.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.822
Baby fall down!

16:30.824 --> 16:33.157

It's me. Stewie.
Don't you remember?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.499
You used to clean for us.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.035
We used to make you use the
bathroom at the gas station.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.272
Hey, you!

16:48.274 --> 16:49.707
Uh, hey, Ryan.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.042
Uh, bad time?

16:51.044 --> 16:52.343
Um, perfect time.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.279
Come on in.
I was just oiling my legs.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.781
So, hey, what's
on for tonight?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.616
You know, my dentist
leaves his office unlocked.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.351
I was thinking we
could do some nitrous

17:00.353 --> 17:01.819
and then have
dinner in there.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.288
Look, Ryan, you're a great guy
and everything,

17:04.290 --> 17:06.958
but I don't like you
in that way.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.494
I mean, there are some things
that I would do with you,

17:09.496 --> 17:11.329
but my heart wouldn't be in it.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.930
What are you talking about?

17:12.932 --> 17:16.134
That you like me,
and you want to be my boyfriend.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.502
(laughs)

17:17.504 --> 17:19.137
You think I'm gay?

17:19.139 --> 17:20.938
Where did you get that?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.141
Uh, uh, you-you tried
to kiss me.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.675
Peter, I'm not gay.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.511
What the hell's
the matter with you?

17:26.513 --> 17:29.113
Look, look, look, let me...
let me put it to you this way.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.748
I'm attracted to you in the way

17:30.750 --> 17:33.684
that a man is attracted
to a woman, but I'm not gay.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.620
When you live out in
Hollywood, you learn

17:35.622 --> 17:37.688
that life is about different
spirits and energies

17:37.690 --> 17:38.956
you meet along the way.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.926
I just thought maybe our spirits
could intertwine, you know?

17:41.928 --> 17:43.761
Our energies could merge.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.264
Like my spirit could go
up inside your energy.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.000
I-I have so much to learn
about show business.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.168
But you know what?

17:50.170 --> 17:51.969
I could never really be
attracted to somebody

17:51.971 --> 17:54.972
who uses labels like
"gay" and "straight."

17:54.974 --> 17:56.340
Maybe you
should just go.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.708
Well-Well, now,
wait a second.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.010
What do you mean?

17:59.012 --> 17:59.911
This isn't working.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.279
It was a nice thought,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.514
but I think we should
go our separate ways.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.349
No, Ryan. I get it now.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.018
I can be what you want.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.586
We could...
Peter.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.921
Don't embarrass yourself.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.556
You need to just
let this go.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.992
Tickle fight!
Tickle fight!
No, Peter, no!

18:14.994 --> 18:16.928
Tickle fight! Tickle
fight! Tickle fight...
Peter, no! No!

18:16.930 --> 18:19.197
Oh, my God... (sobbing)

18:21.133 --> 18:23.134
(sobbing)

18:23.136 --> 18:24.936
It's time for
you to leave.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.205
(sniffles)

18:27.207 --> 18:29.640
I can change.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.209
(quietly):
I can change.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.777
I'm sorry, Peter.
We're done.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.178
We can never talk again.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.648
Here's a cell phone
so we can always talk.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.288
Don't you guys
have any tub toys?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.857
Here. Is rattle.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.992
This is prescription
medication.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.094
And it's not even
your name on the label.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.662
What... What is this?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.097
What's in this tub?

18:53.099 --> 18:54.632
Is jicama.
Jicama?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.367
And what is...?
What...? What...?

18:56.369 --> 18:57.969
This is a chicken leg.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.937
Are you also making soup?

18:59.939 --> 19:01.539
For quinceañera.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.341
Big party. Many peoples.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.675
Oh, my God.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.077
Hay un perro aqui.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.146
<i>¿Doggy es aqui?</i>

19:08.148 --> 19:11.082
I bet even you guys
don't watch <i>George Lopez.</i>

19:11.084 --> 19:12.984
Consuela?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.452
Hey, it's Brian.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.920
I'm-I'm looking for Stewie.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.989
No, no baby <i>aqui.</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:19.357
I peed in your soup.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.825
Happy 15th birthday.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.026
Which, by the way,

19:22.028 --> 19:24.495
is not a special occasion
in the normal world.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.830
Stewie, I've been
worried sick.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.431
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.033
Brian? How did you find me?

19:29.035 --> 19:31.802
I used my nose,
which I always forget about.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.004
Come on, let's go.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.605
No, I'm not going
back! I can't!

19:34.607 --> 19:35.940
They're gonna
be mad at me!

19:35.942 --> 19:37.942
(sighs):
I didn't tell anyone.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.911
You... you didn't?

19:39.913 --> 19:40.912
No, I didn't.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.247
Look, I thought about it,
and to be honest,

19:43.249 --> 19:45.950
it's probably my fault for
leaving you alone in the car.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.187
And if you promise never to do
it again, I won't say anything.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.255
Okay, I promise.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.623
My baby!
What?

19:52.625 --> 19:53.925
I say, let go of me.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.126
Consuela,
we're leaving.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.360
My baby!

19:56.362 --> 19:58.629
Hey, she says
it's her baby, man.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.198
Now, get out of here.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.135
Is my baby. Ernesto.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.536
No, I'm not...
I'm not Ernest...

20:05.538 --> 20:08.639
Okay, this is so messed up
right now.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.108
(Consuela yells, gunfire,
glass shattering)

20:15.614 --> 20:17.615
I did not want
to have to do that.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.518
They were very nice
to me up until then.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.989
Peter, stop staring
out the window.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.290
Ryan's gone.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.326
He finished his movie,
he's moved out.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.161
How could I have been so blind?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.930
How could I not have seen
what he offered?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.132
I think the whole
thing was very strange.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.167
He thought
you were strange!

20:36.169 --> 20:38.970
How about that?
Whatever.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.272
I just can't help but wonder...

20:41.274 --> 20:44.108
will I ever see him again?

20:44.110 --> 20:46.844
(eerie synthesizer music plays)

20:46.846 --> 20:50.948
