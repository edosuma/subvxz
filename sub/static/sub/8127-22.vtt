                What's the      
                matter, Mike?   

00:56.923 --> 00:58.422
I don't know.                   
Something's missing.            

00:58.424 --> 01:00.659
        Not enough salt?        

01:00.661 --> 01:05.530
    Not enough Archie.          
  It's too quiet around here.   

01:05.532 --> 01:08.099
      Michael, don't tell me you
      like arguing with Daddy.  

01:08.101 --> 01:09.300
I didn't say                    
I like it.                      

01:09.302 --> 01:10.935
It's just that                  
I'm used to it.                 

01:10.937 --> 01:12.804
My body is used to it.          

01:12.806 --> 01:14.405
When Archie's here,             
I eat better.

    Well, don't worry, Mike.    

01:18.545 --> 01:21.046
He's only working overtime      
            tonight.            

01:21.048 --> 01:23.882
     Tomorrow he'll be home     
      at his regular time,      

01:23.884 --> 01:27.518
     and I'm sure he'll get     
  in a nice argument with you.  

01:29.188 --> 01:31.389
              Ma, this pot roast
              was delicious.    

01:31.391 --> 01:32.691
        Thank you.              

01:32.693 --> 01:34.726
     Oh, I'll never forget      
         the first time         

01:34.728 --> 01:37.796
        I made pot roast        
        for your father.        

01:37.798 --> 01:40.498
         Only he wasn't         
    your father then.           

01:40.500 --> 01:42.967
  We was just keeping company.  

01:42.969 --> 01:45.770
I invited him to my house       
          for dinner,           

01:45.772 --> 01:47.471
and I made him pot roast,       

01:47.473 --> 01:52.343
  and that was the first time   
  he ever called me "dingbat."  

01:55.815 --> 01:57.015
             Well, that's awful,

01:57.017 --> 01:58.416
              even if he didn't 
              like your cooking.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.451
      Oh, no, he loved it.      

02:00.453 --> 02:01.853
Well, why'd he                  
call you "dingbat"?             

02:01.855 --> 02:03.387
      Well, in them days,       

02:03.389 --> 02:07.692
 Archie was too shy to call me  
"sweetheart" or "darling,"      

02:07.694 --> 02:12.130
    so instead he called me     
     his "little dingbat."      

02:12.132 --> 02:13.598
    And you know what?          

02:13.600 --> 02:17.802
Ever since then, no matter      
how mad he says "dingbat,"      

02:17.804 --> 02:21.806
         I always hear          
  a little "sweetheart" in it.  

02:21.808 --> 02:23.608
              That's lovely, Ma.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.210
Hey, Ma, where'd Archie         
get that word from              

02:25.212 --> 02:26.211
in the first place?             

02:26.213 --> 02:28.646
He inherited it from his father.

02:31.717 --> 02:35.186
    What do you know?           
"Dingbat," the Bunker heirloom. 

02:36.622 --> 02:38.089
Get away from me, all of youse. 

02:38.091 --> 02:39.090
Hi, Daddy.                      
    EDITH: Hello, Archie.       

02:39.092 --> 02:40.291
                  I don't have  
                  time for that.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.459
     I'll get your dinner.      

02:41.461 --> 02:43.261
I ain't got no time             
for that neither, Edith.        

02:43.263 --> 02:44.262
                 It's all ready.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.463
I ain't got no time,            
Edith.                          

02:45.465 --> 02:47.465
I just got time to get          
myself a cheese sandwich        

02:47.467 --> 02:48.867
and a can of beer,              
that's all.                     

02:48.869 --> 02:50.268
    But it won't take long.     

02:50.270 --> 02:52.303
            Edith, I'm telling  
            you, I'm in a hurry.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.106
I ain't even got time           
to go up to the toilet.         

02:55.108 --> 02:58.910
  Oh. Well, if you got to go,   

02:58.912 --> 03:01.079
         you better pay         
     your little visit now.     

03:03.082 --> 03:04.149
    I can wait, Edith,          

03:04.151 --> 03:07.118
if only you don't               
talk about it.                  

03:07.120 --> 03:09.587
          But, Archie,          
     you know how you are.      

03:09.589 --> 03:11.256
You'll get halfway              
to the subway,                  

03:11.258 --> 03:13.792
and you'll have to come         
running back.                   

03:13.794 --> 03:17.195
That's how you missed           
Mrs. Defendorpher's funeral.    

03:17.197 --> 03:19.463
Remember?                       

03:19.465 --> 03:20.598
                I'm telling you,

03:20.600 --> 03:21.800
             this rushing around
             is killing me.     

03:21.802 --> 03:24.368
Oh, why don't you               
skip tonight?                   

03:24.370 --> 03:26.271
                I can't do that,
                Edith.          

03:26.273 --> 03:28.606
         I'm way behind already.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.941
                  Jeez, oh, look
                  at this here! 

03:29.943 --> 03:32.143
         Every hunk of cheese in
         a piece of cellophane. 

03:32.145 --> 03:34.279
        They'll be doing this   
        next with sardines!     

03:34.281 --> 03:36.781
I'll do it.                     

03:36.783 --> 03:38.582
            This job could mean 
            an awful lot to us, 

03:38.584 --> 03:39.583
                this new job.   

03:39.585 --> 03:41.019
Yeah, I know, Archie,           

03:41.021 --> 03:42.653
but even if you                 
don't get it--                  

03:42.655 --> 03:46.691
    Don't say that, will you?   

03:46.693 --> 03:48.293
          Look at me,           
          work hard all my life,

03:48.295 --> 03:50.094
             and what have I got
             to show for it?    

03:50.096 --> 03:51.229
             This job could mean

03:51.231 --> 03:53.431
        a thousand bucks a year 
        extra for the two of us.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.133
Oh, Archie, money ain't         
that important.                 

03:55.135 --> 03:56.801
        Oh... Not to            
        Rockefeller it ain't,   

03:56.803 --> 03:58.536
            because he's got it.

03:58.538 --> 03:59.871
             What about me here?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.272
        Oh, no, Edith,          
        a little extra dough,   

04:01.274 --> 04:03.007
        I can get you           
        all them extra things   

04:03.009 --> 04:04.108
                  that you like,
                  you know?     

04:04.110 --> 04:06.677
But, Archie, I don't            
need nothing.                   

04:06.679 --> 04:09.647
     You're gonna get them      
whether you need them or not!   

04:11.583 --> 04:14.185
                  And besides...

04:14.187 --> 04:15.753
                  it's hard work
                  I do out there

04:15.755 --> 04:17.188
                on that         
                loading platform

04:17.190 --> 04:19.724
                 out in the cold
                 all the time.  

04:19.726 --> 04:21.726
         Dispatcher's job, now, 
         there's something else.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.961
         All the dispatcher does

04:22.963 --> 04:24.963
         is push a pencil across
         a desk all day long.   

04:24.965 --> 04:26.564
         Another thing,         
     how do I know the boss     

04:26.566 --> 04:28.566
     ain't going to go out      
there on that loading dock      

04:28.568 --> 04:30.168
         and replace me         
  with a younger guy someday?   

04:30.170 --> 04:33.504
     Oh, Archie, that ain't     
      gonna happen to you.      

04:33.506 --> 04:34.772
  Oh, people always say that.   

04:34.774 --> 04:36.274
    "That ain't gonna           
        happen to you."         

04:36.276 --> 04:38.476
     Then the first thing,      
    you turn around--           

04:40.479 --> 04:42.213
  You know what I just tasted   
          going down?           

04:42.215 --> 04:43.614
No.                             

04:43.616 --> 04:44.883
Cellophane off the cheese.      
    Thanks a million!           

04:49.121 --> 04:52.257
I think what you're             
doing is wonderful,             

04:52.259 --> 04:54.592
and I want you to know          
I'm proud of you,               

04:54.594 --> 04:57.595
and Mike and Gloria             
will be proud of you too.       

04:57.597 --> 04:59.197
            Did you tell them   
            about this?         

04:59.199 --> 05:00.498
Oh, no, no.                     

05:00.500 --> 05:02.100
          You did! You told them
          the secret, right?    

05:02.102 --> 05:03.834
No, no, Archie, they don't know.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.170
If you don't believe me,        
ask them.                       

05:06.172 --> 05:07.372
                         I will.

05:09.341 --> 05:12.043
            You dingbat, you    
            almost had me do it.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.345
What's the big rush,            
Daddy?                          

05:14.347 --> 05:16.480
The big rush, little girl,      
is that I'm going bowling.      

05:16.482 --> 05:17.481
        That's the rush.        

05:17.483 --> 05:19.683
    Archie, don't you think     

05:19.685 --> 05:23.454
        you'd better pay        
  your little visit upstairs?   

05:23.456 --> 05:28.326
    No, I don't want to pay     
the little visit upstairs.      

05:30.796 --> 05:33.264
      Ma, what's going on       
          with Daddy?           

05:33.266 --> 05:34.265
                        Nothing.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.433
I think                         
it's something.                 

05:35.435 --> 05:37.268
Well, he don't want to be late. 

05:37.270 --> 05:40.004
    It's an important           
      bowling tournament.       

05:40.006 --> 05:41.272
      Another tournament?       

05:41.274 --> 05:43.207
    That's where Daddy said     
    he was going last week.     

05:43.209 --> 05:44.809
              Oh.               

05:44.811 --> 05:47.045
        Well, last week,        
      they was rained out.      

05:51.750 --> 05:53.918
Bowling, rained out?            

05:53.920 --> 05:55.886
             Ma, are you keeping
             something from us? 

05:55.888 --> 05:57.488
            No.                 
GLORIA: Come on, Ma.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.191

    all these nights?           

06:00.193 --> 06:02.460
            Mm, no.             

06:02.462 --> 06:03.761

                 Bette Davis    

06:06.566 --> 06:08.232

"Who wants a man hanging around 
the house all the time, anyway? 

06:12.738 --> 06:13.938

          want to talk about it?

                 for the movies.

I want to find out

what's going on                 
around here.                    

06:47.440 --> 06:49.240
     Gloria, if your mother     
    doesn't want to tell us,    

06:49.242 --> 06:50.408

        so nosy. Let's go.

Daddy left under my hat,

    Oh.                         

07:15.168 --> 07:18.403
How could Daddy                 
go bowling without this?        

07:18.405 --> 07:20.905
    Maybe he's the referee.     

07:20.907 --> 07:22.640
                  Ma!           

07:22.642 --> 07:24.942
    There's no referee          
          in bowling.

Oh, Gloria,                     
I'm sorry,                      

07:27.147 --> 07:29.947
     but I promised Archie      
      I wouldn't tell you.      

07:29.949 --> 07:31.782
But, Ma,                        
that was before                 

07:31.784 --> 07:33.217

the bowling ball,               

07:33.219 --> 07:34.485

we already know,                

07:36.289 --> 07:37.988

a promise.

    Oh, Archie never wanted     
     you two to know this.      

08:12.792 --> 08:16.660
You see, he had to leave school 
          to get a job          

08:16.662 --> 08:20.331
      and help his family,      
     so he never graduated.

            quiz book over there

12:57.843 --> 12:59.543

             and start asking me

12:59.545 --> 13:01.445

             we didn't finish.  

13:01.447 --> 13:03.080
Yeah, sure, Archie.             
                    Hurry up.   

13:03.082 --> 13:04.482
Arch, uh,                       

13:04.484 --> 13:06.284
when you were talking           
with Ma the other day           

13:06.286 --> 13:07.985
about Manifest Destiny, uh,     

13:07.987 --> 13:09.387
did you mention the fact        

13:09.389 --> 13:11.054
that it was just another name   
for American imperialism?       

13:12.557 --> 13:13.557
              Huh?              

13:13.559 --> 13:14.925
That's right.                   

13:14.927 --> 13:17.127
     It was just an excuse      
to rip off other people's land. 

13:17.129 --> 13:18.729
         That's the way         
  we stole Texas from Mexico.   

13:18.731 --> 13:20.564
     Listen, subversive...      

13:24.068 --> 13:26.671
the U.S. of A. never stole      
      nothing from nobody.      

13:26.673 --> 13:29.407
 The Mexicans was only too glad 
        to give us Texas        

13:29.409 --> 13:33.911
         after we beat          
 the hell out of them in a war. 

13:33.913 --> 13:37.181
          Here it is.           

13:37.183 --> 13:39.283
          Well, come on,        
          ask me some questions.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.584
                      I got no  
                      time here.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.787
     Arch, uh, do you mind      
  if I listen to your answers?  

13:42.789 --> 13:43.854
    I love science fiction.     

13:45.624 --> 13:48.258
Listen, you. Just get away      
from my study table, huh?       

13:48.260 --> 13:50.561
Arch, I-- I have to finish      
this project by tomorrow.       

13:50.563 --> 13:53.197
      I gotta take a test       
    later on tonight.           

13:53.199 --> 13:55.098
  Now, will you take yourself   
          out of here?          

13:55.100 --> 13:56.099
All right.                      

13:56.101 --> 13:57.735
                 Edith, sit     
                 down and start.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.303
Yeah, I'll sit over here,       

13:59.305 --> 14:01.439
so you can't peek               
at the answers.                 

14:03.575 --> 14:04.575
              Come on, will you?

14:04.577 --> 14:05.676
                        Ask.    

14:05.678 --> 14:07.878
First question:                 

14:07.880 --> 14:11.716
When were the Articles          
of Peace signed?                

14:11.718 --> 14:13.250
                     Uh, answer:

14:13.252 --> 14:18.556
        The Articles of Peace   
        were signed in, uh...   

14:18.558 --> 14:20.391
         Gee, dates are so hard.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.659
          Why do they ask dates?

14:21.661 --> 14:22.960
             I don't know. When?

14:22.962 --> 14:26.397
Artic... Articles               
of Peace, 1783.                 

14:26.399 --> 14:27.398
                All right, 17...

14:27.400 --> 14:28.566
     Now, hold it, hold it.     

14:28.568 --> 14:29.800
      Wait'll I get that.       

14:29.802 --> 14:34.304
Articles... Peace... 1783.      

14:36.708 --> 14:38.075
      All right, go ahead.      

14:39.944 --> 14:41.579
         Next question.         

14:41.581 --> 14:46.250
 What was Columbus looking for  
    in his expedition?          

14:46.252 --> 14:50.120
Uh, in his expedition, Colum... 
    uh, Columbus was looking    

14:50.122 --> 14:53.023
        for a f--               
 A faster route to the Indies.  

14:53.025 --> 14:55.192
That's good, Archie.            

14:55.194 --> 14:58.729
Now, answer true or false.      

14:58.731 --> 15:03.033
President McKinley started      
the Spanish-American War        

15:03.035 --> 15:06.404
despite the fact                
that Spain had already agreed   

15:06.406 --> 15:08.406
to all our demands.             

15:08.408 --> 15:10.374
                 That's false.  

15:10.376 --> 15:11.575
Oh...                           

15:11.577 --> 15:13.544
I'm sorry, Archie.              

15:13.546 --> 15:14.912
It's true.                      

15:16.848 --> 15:18.215
         It ain't true.         

15:18.217 --> 15:21.385
     No American president      
 never started a war over that. 

15:21.387 --> 15:23.421
That's what the book says.      

15:23.423 --> 15:24.522
    Aw...look at that!          

15:24.524 --> 15:26.757
    You see what I got to do    
    to pass this test?          

15:26.759 --> 15:29.493
         I got to lie.          

15:29.495 --> 15:31.194
        All right,              
I'll put it down, though.       

15:31.196 --> 15:33.664
  McKinley... All right, true.  

15:33.666 --> 15:35.733
    Get it over with.           
         Next question.         

15:35.735 --> 15:39.036
     Who said the treatment     
     of the American Indian     

15:39.038 --> 15:41.371
    was a national disgrace?    

15:41.373 --> 15:43.040
        Treatment               
of the American Indian...       

15:43.042 --> 15:45.776
    national disgrace, uh...    

15:45.778 --> 15:47.144
      Well, uh, Geronimo?       

15:53.151 --> 15:54.518
              No.               

15:54.520 --> 15:57.822
Come on, it had to be some      
  Indian that said that. Who?   

15:57.824 --> 15:59.690
    President Kennedy.          

15:59.692 --> 16:01.391
    Aw, that's a lie!           

16:01.393 --> 16:03.527
    Kennedy never said that,    

16:03.529 --> 16:05.529
      or maybe he said it,      
     but he didn't mean it.     

16:05.531 --> 16:07.832
     He-- He maybe said it      
when he was running for office. 

16:07.834 --> 16:09.433
         He was trying          
    to get the Indian vote,     

16:09.435 --> 16:11.401
which he never got anyhow.      

16:11.403 --> 16:12.837
        How do you know?        

16:12.839 --> 16:16.239
    Because, Meathead,          
    the Indians don't vote.     

16:16.241 --> 16:19.677
 Archie, the Indians were given 
    the vote in 1924.           

16:19.679 --> 16:21.779
  I ain't talking about that.   

16:21.781 --> 16:24.114
        I'm saying              
that they don't use their vote, 

16:24.116 --> 16:25.749
     like a fellow told me.     

16:25.751 --> 16:27.351
They sell all their horses      
        for booze,              

16:27.353 --> 16:29.152
    and then they can't ride    
        into town.              

16:33.592 --> 16:36.226
          That is the stupidest 
          thing I've ever heard!

16:36.228 --> 16:37.595
That ain't stupid!              
That's the truth!               

16:37.597 --> 16:39.162
That's what the Indians         
do to us                        

16:39.164 --> 16:40.764
after all we done               
for them.                       

16:40.766 --> 16:42.666
 All we've done for them? Arch! 

16:42.668 --> 16:44.267
Let me tell you something       
    about this country          

16:44.269 --> 16:46.269
    and the American Indians    
  and all we've done for them!  

16:46.271 --> 16:47.671
        We lied to them,        
        we cheated them,        

16:47.673 --> 16:49.272
     and then we drove them     
         off their land         

16:49.274 --> 16:50.307
     without paying for it!     

16:50.309 --> 16:51.441
Hold it! Then what--            

16:51.443 --> 16:52.843
  What are you talking about,   
          their land?           

16:52.845 --> 16:54.344
    They never had no land!     

16:54.346 --> 16:56.279
  They couldn't read or write.  

16:56.281 --> 16:58.649
     How could Sitting Bull     
         sign a lease?          

17:02.086 --> 17:03.120
    All the Indians ever did    

17:03.122 --> 17:05.388
        was ride around         
     scalping wagon trains.     

17:05.391 --> 17:06.924
Archie, what would you do       

17:06.925 --> 17:08.659
    if somebody cheated you     
    out of your land?           

17:08.661 --> 17:09.894
Well, I wouldn't scalp the guy. 

17:09.896 --> 17:11.628
I'd hire myself a lawyer.

I get a diploma out of it.      

18:57.903 --> 19:01.005
        You're not being        
     honest with yourself.      

19:01.007 --> 19:03.173
  I certainly am, little girl.  

19:03.175 --> 19:06.376
        I sat down              
 and I asked myself a question. 

19:06.378 --> 19:08.545
            I said,             
"Can you pass this history exam 

19:08.547 --> 19:10.748
            without             
 them little pieces of paper?"  

19:10.750 --> 19:12.650
    And I gave myself           
    an honest answer.           

19:12.652 --> 19:14.518
      "No, you couldn't."       

19:16.420 --> 19:19.556
                    What's wrong
                    with you?   

19:19.558 --> 19:22.626
                You been talking
                to your father? 

19:22.628 --> 19:24.028
Michael, do you know            
what Daddy's doing?             

19:24.030 --> 19:26.229
He is preparing crib notes      
to cheat on his exam.           

19:26.231 --> 19:27.765
 Well, that doesn't surprise me.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.700
        Ah, lay off me,         
    the two of youse.           

19:29.702 --> 19:31.702
      You don't understand      
        the whole thing.        

19:31.704 --> 19:32.903
    I'm up for a better job.    

19:32.905 --> 19:34.504
            I ain't going to get
            that better job     

19:34.506 --> 19:35.839
                without I get   
                my diploma.     

19:35.841 --> 19:37.841
    I'm doing this for the      
    good of the whole family.   

19:37.843 --> 19:39.276
                Oh, so what     
                you're saying   

19:39.278 --> 19:40.811
    is that the end justifies   
    the means, huh?             

19:42.513 --> 19:45.515
      I ain't saying that,      
because I don't know what it is.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.917
Archie, you're saying           
that it's all right             

19:46.919 --> 19:48.118
for you to do                   
something bad                   

19:48.120 --> 19:51.088
in order to get something       
that you think is good.         

19:51.090 --> 19:53.390
             Well?              

19:53.392 --> 19:54.792
You know, you'd make            
a great witness.                

19:54.794 --> 19:56.593
            ARCHIE: For what?   
The Watergate trial.            

19:56.595 --> 19:57.928
That's the same                 
excuse they gave.               

19:57.930 --> 19:59.930
      The Watergate trial,      
      the Watergate trial!      

19:59.932 --> 20:03.100
All youse liberals are plunking 
on that note all the time.      

20:03.102 --> 20:04.902
     You lost the election.     
     Why don't you shut up?     

20:04.904 --> 20:06.970
Edith, bring me out             

20:06.972 --> 20:08.338
the rest of                     
my history notes.               

20:08.340 --> 20:09.673
            You mean crib notes.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.175
Clam up, you.                   

20:11.177 --> 20:12.176
         Here they are!         

20:12.178 --> 20:13.744
Surprise!                       

20:24.288 --> 20:26.423
        What did you do here?   

20:26.425 --> 20:27.424
I pasted them--                 

20:27.426 --> 20:29.026
                 You pasted them
                 on there, yeah!

20:29.028 --> 20:30.627
              But how am I going
              to use them?      

20:30.629 --> 20:32.029
    I can't get them off now.   

20:32.031 --> 20:34.832
Now you can study them          
on the subway.                  

20:38.302 --> 20:39.536
        Who told you to do that?

20:39.538 --> 20:40.704
Nobody.                         

20:40.706 --> 20:43.240
I thought of it                 
all by myself.                  

20:46.277 --> 20:47.611
             From now on, Edith,

20:47.613 --> 20:50.114
        when a thought starts   
        coming at you,          

20:50.116 --> 20:51.548
                      duck, huh?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.652
      Ma! Daddy's coming.       
  Michael, you better get up.   

20:55.654 --> 20:56.653
    Ma, you got the letter?     

20:56.655 --> 20:57.855
Yeah, right here.               

20:57.857 --> 21:00.057
          I don't know if I want
          to be in the room     

21:00.059 --> 21:01.191
                when he opens   
                the letter.     

21:01.193 --> 21:02.692
                I mean, what    
                if he failed?   

21:02.694 --> 21:03.961
Well, that's the point, Michael.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.363
If he did fail, we have to      
try and cheer him up.           

21:06.365 --> 21:07.865
        Gloria, I don't think   
        my being here           

21:07.867 --> 21:10.267
    is going to cheer him up.   

21:10.269 --> 21:13.536
I think you should both         
go upstairs and wait,           

21:13.538 --> 21:15.973
and I'll let you know           
as soon as he opens it.         

21:15.975 --> 21:16.974
                      Good idea,
                      good idea.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.341
Hurry, Michael,                 
he's coming.                    

21:28.619 --> 21:30.254
  What's the matter with you?   

21:30.256 --> 21:33.991
Archie, this came for you today.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.592
     It's from the school.      

21:35.594 --> 21:38.662
It may be about your test.      

21:38.664 --> 21:41.298
                  Don't shove it
                  at me, Edith. 

21:41.300 --> 21:42.966
Don't you want                  
to open it?                     

21:42.968 --> 21:45.869
          Let me take off my hat
          and coat first, huh?  

21:45.871 --> 21:48.238
                Can you do that?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.239
        From the school, huh?   

21:49.241 --> 21:50.107
Yeah.                           

21:53.044 --> 21:54.577
                  Give it to me.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.984
I guess it's the test           
result, all right.              

22:00.986 --> 22:01.852
                    Yeah.       

22:06.057 --> 22:09.059
I can't open it.                

22:09.061 --> 22:11.161
You open it for me,             
Edith.                          

22:11.163 --> 22:13.630
                Well, give me   
                the envelope.   

22:13.632 --> 22:16.900
Yeah, here's                    
the envelope.                   

22:16.902 --> 22:18.068
                    Oh, my...   

22:18.070 --> 22:21.471
             it's just like     
             the Academy Awards.

22:28.379 --> 22:30.113
Well, read it,                  
will you?                       

22:30.115 --> 22:34.017
Who's the winner,               
me or the school?               

22:34.019 --> 22:36.220
                Archie, you are!

22:36.222 --> 22:37.620
                     You passed!

22:37.622 --> 22:39.656
Yeah?                           
Let me see the paper.           

22:39.658 --> 22:40.657
            Oh, Mike, Gloria,   
            he passed!          

22:40.659 --> 22:41.859
Hey, hey, I did?                
I did?                          

22:41.861 --> 22:44.061
             We got a dispatcher
             in the family!     

22:44.063 --> 22:45.628
        Hey, all right!         

22:45.630 --> 22:46.830
Congratulations!                

22:46.832 --> 22:48.232
Way to go!                      

22:48.234 --> 22:49.333
[PHONE RINGS]                   

22:49.335 --> 22:50.334
    That's great!               
    I'll get it!                

22:50.336 --> 22:51.501
    I passed it there!          

22:51.503 --> 22:53.337
See, Daddy, you did it          
all on your own.                

22:53.339 --> 22:54.604
You didn't even need            
to cheat.                       

22:54.606 --> 22:55.605
         That's right.          

22:55.607 --> 22:57.307
     I gambled a little, though,

22:57.309 --> 23:00.477
        tossing a nickel        
        on the true-and-falsies.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.946
        Hey, Arch,              
    it's Stretch Cunningham.    

23:02.948 --> 23:03.947
     Oh, good old Stretch.      

23:03.949 --> 23:04.948
    Give me the phone.          

23:04.950 --> 23:06.183
                Wait'll he hears
                the news.       

23:06.185 --> 23:08.252
  Hiya, Stretch, Archie here.   

23:08.254 --> 23:09.753
    Hold it, there, hold it.    

23:09.755 --> 23:12.522
Before you talk any more,       
you got to show a little respect

23:12.524 --> 23:14.524
      when you're talking       
to a high school graduate,      

23:14.526 --> 23:15.558
         class of '73.          

23:18.296 --> 23:19.662
        Yeah, I got it.         

23:21.900 --> 23:23.267
        You what?               

23:25.569 --> 23:27.437
  Well, when did that happen?   

23:29.140 --> 23:30.340
        Oh, yeah.               

23:32.476 --> 23:33.343
             Yeah.              

23:34.678 --> 23:35.946
    Yeah, goodbye, Stretch.     

23:35.948 --> 23:39.216
      Uh, by the way, uh,       
      thanks for nothing.       

23:39.218 --> 23:41.418
What's the matter,              
Daddy?                          

23:41.420 --> 23:46.123
             Well,              
    the matter is, uh,          

23:46.125 --> 23:49.226
 looks like I've been studying  
    the wrong subject.          

23:49.228 --> 23:51.895
      Instead of studying       
    American History,           

23:51.897 --> 23:53.096
            I guess             
I should've been studying       

23:53.098 --> 23:55.698
                  the theory    
                  of relativity.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.699
What are you                    
talking about?                  

23:56.701 --> 23:59.702
     Relativity, Meathead.      

23:59.704 --> 24:02.839
        The boss' nephew        
got the dispatcher's job.       

24:02.841 --> 24:04.174
        Oh, Daddy.              
That's too bad, Arch.           

24:04.176 --> 24:06.243
How could they                  
do that to him?                 

24:06.245 --> 24:08.645
        Ah, well, that's        
      the way things are.       

24:08.647 --> 24:13.616
  Jeez... And here I am, stuck  
  with a high school diploma.   

24:22.626 --> 24:24.995
      Archie, here it is!       

24:24.997 --> 24:27.630
Here's your diploma, all framed.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.199
Oh, look at that.               

24:29.201 --> 24:30.567
      Ain't it beautiful?       

24:30.569 --> 24:31.568
                        Yeah.   

24:31.570 --> 24:33.603
Archie, where shall we hang it? 

24:33.605 --> 24:36.506
  I think you ought to hang it  
someplace where it'll stand out.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.708
    How about Ripley's          
Believe It or Not Museum?
