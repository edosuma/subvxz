00:47.464 --> 00:49.007
Open your eyes.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.931
This is where our magic comes from?

00:56.098 --> 00:57.098
Mm-hmm.

00:58.183 --> 01:03.105
This candle holds the miracle
given to our family.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.024
How did we get a miracle?

01:07.526 --> 01:09.194
Long ago...

01:10.362 --> 01:13.365
When my three babies had just been born...

01:15.617 --> 01:20.080
<i>Your </i> abuelo <i> Pedro and
I were forced to flee our home.</i>

01:22.875 --> 01:25.627
<i>And though many joined us...</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:27.880
<i>Hoping to find a new home...</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:31.800
<i>We could not escape the dangers...</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:38.932
<i>And your </i> abuelo <i>was lost.</i>

01:41.727 --> 01:44.605
<i>But in our darkest moment...</i>

01:45.814 --> 01:48.609
<i>We were given a miracle.</i>

01:50.152 --> 01:55.782
<i>The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out.</i>

01:56.450 --> 02:01.121
<i>And it blessed us with a refuge
in which to live.</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.460
<i>A place of wonder.</i>

02:06.919 --> 02:08.377
<i>An </i> encanto.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.047
<i>An </i> encanto.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.259
<i>The miracle grew.</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:18.764
<i>And our house...</i>

02:20.474 --> 02:22.768
<i>Our </i> casita <i>itself...</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:27.064
<i>Came alive to shelter us.</i>

02:30.817 --> 02:33.195
<i>When my children came of age...</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:38.492
<i>The miracle blessed each
with a magic gift to help us.</i>

02:41.036 --> 02:43.372
<i>And when their children came of age...</i>

02:43.539 --> 02:45.374
<i>They got magic, too.</i>

02:45.958 --> 02:47.334
<i>That's right!</i>

02:47.543 --> 02:51.296
<i>And together, our family's gifts...</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:55.843
<i>Have made our new home a paradise.</i>

02:57.594 --> 03:04.184
Tonight, this candle will
give you your gift, <i>mi vida.</i>

03:04.393 --> 03:09.565
Strengthen our community,
strengthen our home.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.901
Make your family proud.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.612
Make my family proud.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.246
Yes, yes, <i>casita, </i> we're going!

03:30.294 --> 03:33.088
What do you think my gift will be?

03:33.463 --> 03:36.884
You are a wonder, mirabel madrigal.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.511
Whatever gift awaits...

03:40.554 --> 03:44.141
<i>Will be just as special as you.</i>

04:14.796 --> 04:16.548
Make your family proud.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.341
Morning, <i>abuelo!</i>

04:27.142 --> 04:29.353
Hey! When's the magic gift happen?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.188
My cousin's ceremony is tonight.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.481
What's his gift?

04:32.648 --> 04:33.774
We're gonna find out!

04:33.941 --> 04:35.025
What's your gift?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.235
Who's asking?

04:36.401 --> 04:37.401
Us!

04:37.444 --> 04:42.616
{\an8}Well, "us," I can't just talk about myself.
I'm only part of the amazing madrigals.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.368
Who's all the amazing madrigals?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.537
Ah, you're not gonna leave me alone,
are you?

04:46.703 --> 04:47.913
<i>Casita,</i> help me out.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.081
Drawers!

04:49.831 --> 04:50.832
Floors!

04:51.333 --> 04:52.334
Doors!

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
Let's go!

04:54.002 --> 04:56.964
<i>This is our home
we've got every generation.</i>

04:57.130 --> 05:00.175
<i>So full of music
a rhythm of its own design.</i>

05:00.384 --> 05:03.804
<i>This is my family
a perfect constellation.</i>

05:03.971 --> 05:06.890
<i>So many stars
and everybody gets to shine.</i>

05:07.057 --> 05:08.057
<i>Whoa.</i>

05:08.183 --> 05:10.519
<i>But let's be clear
abuela runs this show.</i>

05:10.686 --> 05:14.064
<i>Whoa
she led us here so many years ago.</i>

05:14.231 --> 05:17.359
<i>Whoa
and every year our family blessings grow.</i>

05:17.860 --> 05:20.863
<i>There's just a lot
you simply got to know so.</i>

05:21.029 --> 05:23.615
<i>Welcome to the family madrigal.</i>

05:24.491 --> 05:26.743
<i>The home of the family madrigal.</i>

05:26.910 --> 05:27.911
<i>We're on our way.</i>

05:28.078 --> 05:31.331
<i>Where all the people are fantastical
and magical</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:33.750
<i>I'm part of the family madrigal.</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:36.295
- Oh, my gosh! It's them!
- What are the gifts?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.731
- I can't remember all the gifts!
- But I don't know who is who.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.007
All right, all right, relax!

05:40.174 --> 05:42.968
- It is physically impossible to relax!
- Tell us everything!

05:43.135 --> 05:45.637
- What are your powers?
- Just tell us what everyone can do!

05:45.971 --> 05:48.015
And that's why coffee's for grown-ups.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.643
<i>My tía pepa
her mood affects the weather.</i>

05:51.810 --> 05:54.980
<i>When she's unhappy
well, the temperature gets weird.</i>

05:55.147 --> 05:56.398
<i>My tío Bruno.</i>

05:56.690 --> 05:58.192
<i>We don't talk about Bruno!</i>

05:58.650 --> 06:02.070
<i>They say he saw the future
one day he disappeared.</i>

06:02.237 --> 06:05.490
<i>Oh
and that's my mom Julieta, here's her deal.</i>

06:05.657 --> 06:08.994
<i>Whoa
the truth is she can heal you with a meal.</i>

06:09.161 --> 06:12.539
<i>Whoa
her recipes are remedies for real.</i>

06:12.748 --> 06:15.167
<i>If you're impressed
imagine how I feel.</i>

06:15.334 --> 06:16.334
Mom!

06:16.418 --> 06:18.712
<i>Welcome to the family madrigal.</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:21.632
<i>The home of the family madrigal.</i>

06:21.798 --> 06:23.008
Hey, coming through!

06:23.175 --> 06:26.094
<i>I know it sounds a bit fantastical
and magical.</i>

06:26.261 --> 06:29.056
<i>But I'm part of the family madrigal.</i>

06:29.515 --> 06:32.226
- <i>Two guys fell in love with family madrigal.
- With family madrigal.</i>

06:32.976 --> 06:35.729
-<i>And now they're part of the
family madrigal -the family madrigal.</i>

06:36.146 --> 06:39.191
<i>See, yeah, tío félix married pepa
and my dad married Julieta.</i>

06:39.358 --> 06:42.319
<i>-That's how abuela became an
abuela madrigal -abuela madrigal.</i>

06:42.486 --> 06:43.570
<i>Let's go let's go.</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:47.032
<i>We swear to always
help those around us.</i>

06:47.199 --> 06:50.410
<i>And earn the miracle
that somehow found us.</i>

06:50.577 --> 06:53.247
<i>The town keeps growing
the world keeps turning.</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:56.875
<i>But work and dedication
will keep the miracle burning.</i>

06:57.042 --> 07:00.671
<i>And each new generation
must keep the miracle burning.</i>

07:01.380 --> 07:03.140
Wait,
who's the sister and who's the cousin?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.299
There are so many people!

07:04.508 --> 07:05.693
How do you keep them all straight?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.344
Okay, okay, okay.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.639
<i>So many kids in our house
so, let's turn the sound up.</i>

07:10.848 --> 07:14.142
<i>You know why?
I think it's time for a grandkid round-up!</i>

07:14.309 --> 07:15.978
<i>Grandkid round-up.</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:19.231
<i>Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop.</i>

07:19.398 --> 07:22.818
<i>Camilo shapeshifts
Antonio gets his gift today.</i>

07:22.985 --> 07:26.280
-<i>My older sisters Isabela and luisa
</i>-<i>Isabela and luisa.</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:29.616
<i>One strong, one graceful
perfect in every way.</i>

07:29.783 --> 07:33.078
-<i>Isabela
</i>-<i>grows a flower and the town goes wild.</i>

07:33.245 --> 07:34.538
<i>Isabela.</i>

07:34.705 --> 07:36.623
<i>She's the perfect golden child.</i>

07:36.874 --> 07:38.125
<i>Luisa, luisa.</i>

07:38.292 --> 07:39.960
<i>And luisa's super strong.</i>

07:40.127 --> 07:42.379
<i>The beauty and the brawn do no wrong.</i>

07:42.546 --> 07:44.256
- Let's get ready!
- Coming, <i>abuela!</i>

07:44.590 --> 07:46.508
<i>That's life in the family madrigal.</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:50.053
<i>Now you know the family madrigal.</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:54.308
<i>Where all the people are fantastical
and magical.</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:57.644
<i>That's who we are in the family madrigal
adiós.</i>

07:58.770 --> 08:00.439
But what's your gift?

08:03.275 --> 08:05.360
<i>Well, I gotta go
the life of a madrigal.</i>

08:06.320 --> 08:08.864
<i>But now you all know the family madrigal.</i>

08:09.740 --> 08:12.743
<i>I never meant this to get autobiographical.</i>

08:12.951 --> 08:15.829
<i>It was just to review the family madrigal
let's go.</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:17.640
- <i>But what about mirabel?
</i>- <i>It starts with abuela.</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:19.142
<i>And then tía pepa
she handles the weather.</i>

08:19.166 --> 08:20.166
<i>But what about mirabel?</i>

08:20.209 --> 08:22.312
<i>My mom Julieta can make you feel better
with just one arepa.</i>

08:22.336 --> 08:23.521
- <i>But what about mirabel?
</i>- <i>My dad agustín.</i>

08:23.545 --> 08:25.339
<i>Well he's accident-prone
but he means well.</i>

08:25.506 --> 08:26.590
<i>But what about mirabel?</i>

08:26.757 --> 08:28.735
<i>Hey you said you wanna know what everyone
does, I got sisters and cousins and.</i>

08:28.759 --> 08:29.593
<i>Mirabel.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:32.346
<i>My primo Camilo won't stop
until he makes you smile today.</i>

08:32.638 --> 08:35.140
<i>My cousin Dolores can hear
this whole chorus a mile away.</i>

08:35.765 --> 08:36.933
<i>Look it's Mr. Mariano.</i>

08:37.100 --> 08:38.453
<i>Hey you can marry my sister if you wanna.</i>

08:38.477 --> 08:40.038
<i>Between you and me
she's kind of a prima Donna.</i>

08:40.062 --> 08:42.481
<i>Oh, I've said too much
and thank you but I really gotta go.</i>

08:42.648 --> 08:44.149
-<i>My family's amazing</i> -<i>mirabel.</i>

08:44.316 --> 08:45.585
-<i>And I'm in my family so
</i>-<i>mirabel.</i>

08:45.609 --> 08:46.443
<i>Well.</i>

08:46.527 --> 08:48.195
Mirabel!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.907
What are you doing?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.868
They were just asking
about the family and...

08:55.035 --> 08:58.747
She was about to tell us
about her super awesome gift!

08:58.914 --> 09:01.124
Oh, mirabel didn't get one.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.755
You didn't get a gift?

09:07.756 --> 09:10.008
Mirabel! Delivery!

09:10.175 --> 09:13.595
I gave you the special since
you're the only madrigal kid with no gift.

09:13.762 --> 09:18.892
I call it the "not special special"
since you have no gift.

09:19.643 --> 09:20.643
Thanks.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.146
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.566
The last gift ceremony was a bummer.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.443
Last one being yours that did not work.

09:28.819 --> 09:32.573
If I was you, I'd be really sad.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.909
Well, my little friend, I am not.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.704
Because the truth is, gift or no gift...

09:38.871 --> 09:41.540
I am just as special
as the rest of my family.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.166
Who wants more pink?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.053
All right, guys, where do I drop the wagon?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.921
Maybe your gift is being in denial.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.256
I made a rainbow!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.758
Get the chairs out of the way.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.468
Sorry. Excuse me.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.596
Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?

09:56.972 --> 09:59.266
Lift it higher. Higher.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.976
- Hey, nice job over there.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.020
Camilo, we need another José!

10:03.187 --> 10:04.188
José!

10:05.439 --> 10:07.482
Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!

10:07.649 --> 10:09.693
I'm on it! Careful, sis!

10:11.695 --> 10:13.895
My baby's night has to be perfect,
and it's not perfect.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.300
And people are going to be coming.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.533
And nothing's ready.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.743
The flowers!

10:17.910 --> 10:21.413
Did someone say flowers?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.081
Isabela!

10:23.248 --> 10:25.542
Our angel, our angel!

10:25.709 --> 10:27.503
Please don't clap.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.172
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.258
A little sisterly advice...

10:33.425 --> 10:36.025
If you weren't always trying too hard,
you wouldn't be in the way.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.014
Actually, isa, this is called helping.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.141
And I'm not in the way. You are.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.188
Excuse me.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.107
<i>Mi vida,</i> you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.317
I know, <i>mamá.</i>

10:50.484 --> 10:53.529
I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.947
She's right, <i>amor.</i>

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
First gift ceremony since yours.
A lot of emotions.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.618
- Bee stings!
- And I've been there.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.205
When me and your <i>tío </i> félix
married into the family...

11:03.664 --> 11:06.959
Outsiders who had no gift,
never, ever would...

11:07.125 --> 11:10.796
Surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel...

11:10.963 --> 11:12.089
UN-ceptional.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.257
Okay, <i>papi.</i>

11:13.423 --> 11:14.609
- I'm just saying, I get it.
- Eat.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.343
<i>Mi amor,</i> if you ever wanna talk...

11:16.510 --> 11:20.055
I gotta put out the stuff.
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.808
Sorry, you could. You look great.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.143
<i>- Corazón,</i> remember!
- Yeah, remember!

11:25.310 --> 11:27.479
- You have nothing to prove!
- You have nothing to prove!

11:35.737 --> 11:37.697
{\an8}- You guys can set up over here.
- Clean your rooms!

11:37.990 --> 11:39.700
I don't care how big they are.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.369
Has anybody seen my <i>tiple?</i>

11:46.832 --> 11:47.832
One hour!

11:49.877 --> 11:51.128
No, no, no!

11:51.295 --> 11:55.382
Maybe you should leave the decorations
to someone else?

11:55.549 --> 11:58.969
No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.600
Mirabel, I know you want to help.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.352
But tonight must go perfectly.

12:07.978 --> 12:12.566
The whole town relies on our family,
on our gifts.

12:12.733 --> 12:18.947
So, the best way for some of us to help
is to step aside.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.492
Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.578
Okay?

12:25.495 --> 12:26.495
Mm-hmm.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.876
- Pepa! You have a cloud!
- I know, <i>mamá.</i>

12:31.043 --> 12:34.713
But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.592
<i>Mamá,</i> be nice to mirabel, okay?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.886
You know tonight will be hard for her.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.556
If the gift ceremony doesn't go well
this time...

12:44.723 --> 12:47.059
Tonight will be hard for us all.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.358
Antonio!

13:03.450 --> 13:06.328
Everyone's looking for you.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.793
This present will self-destruct
if you don't take it...

13:13.001 --> 13:14.670
In three...

13:14.837 --> 13:16.588
Two...

13:16.755 --> 13:18.340
One...

13:24.847 --> 13:26.056
Nervous?

13:27.641 --> 13:30.185
You have nothing to worry about.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.312
You're gonna get your gift
and open that door...

13:32.479 --> 13:35.816
And it's gonna be the coolest ever.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.484
I know it.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.697
What if it doesn't work?

13:43.115 --> 13:46.827
Well, in that impossible scenario...

13:46.994 --> 13:50.873
You'd stay here in the nursery with me.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.624
Forever.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.085
And I'd get you all to myself.

13:56.295 --> 13:59.381
I wish you could have a door.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.719
You know what?

14:03.886 --> 14:06.388
You don't have to worry about me...

14:06.555 --> 14:09.349
'Cause I have an amazing family...

14:09.516 --> 14:11.894
And an amazing house.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.646
And an amazing you.

14:15.647 --> 14:20.027
And seeing you get your special gift
and your door...

14:20.194 --> 14:23.655
That's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.

14:25.449 --> 14:30.913
But, alas, I am gonna miss
having the world's best roomie.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.380
I know you're an animal guy...

14:40.547 --> 14:44.343
And I made this so,
when you move into your cool, new room...

14:44.760 --> 14:46.970
You always have something to snuggle with.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.983
All right, <i>hombrecito,</i> you ready?

15:01.527 --> 15:03.529
Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.157
Okay, okay, we're going!

15:24.591 --> 15:25.968
Here you go!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.480
Cecilia, up top!

16:31.700 --> 16:32.868
There you are.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.454
Look at you! All grown up.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.873
Pepi, <i>amor, </i> you're gonna get him all wet.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.083
You are making your papa proud.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.376
I don't sound like that.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.711
I don't sound like that.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.755
<i>Abuela</i> says it's time.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.591
We'll be waiting at your door.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.758
Okay, okay.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.218
Okay, okay.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.929
All right, I'm done!

17:01.063 --> 17:03.273
Fifty years ago...

17:04.358 --> 17:07.152
In our darkest moment...

17:08.028 --> 17:11.281
This candle blessed us with a miracle.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.409
And the greatest honor of our family...

17:14.576 --> 17:20.540
Has been to use our blessings
to serve this beloved community.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.461
Tonight, we come together once more...

17:24.627 --> 17:27.839
As another steps into the light...

17:28.464 --> 17:30.467
To make us proud.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.416
I can't.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.128
I need you.

18:19.892 --> 18:23.103
Come on, let's get you to your door.

19:28.252 --> 19:32.965
Will you use your gift
to honor our miracle?

19:33.423 --> 19:35.884
Will you serve this community...

19:36.051 --> 19:38.428
And strengthen our home?

20:11.295 --> 20:12.880
I understand you.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.218
Of course they can come!

20:40.616 --> 20:42.784
We have a new gift!

21:01.178 --> 21:03.764
It's bigger on the inside?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.357
Antonio!

21:16.318 --> 21:18.487
You wanna go where?

21:45.222 --> 21:47.808
- That was great!
- Okay! All right!

21:48.809 --> 21:50.686
That was amazing.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.648
I knew you could do it!

21:54.815 --> 21:58.819
A gift just as special as you.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.407
We need a picture!

22:03.574 --> 22:06.285
Everyone! Come, come, come!

22:06.827 --> 22:10.455
It's a great night! It's a perfect night!

22:12.165 --> 22:13.625
Everyone, together!

22:14.126 --> 22:16.962
<i>La familia madrigal!</i>

22:28.807 --> 22:32.186
<i>Don't be upset or mad at all.</i>

22:34.396 --> 22:37.524
<i>Don't feel regret or sad at all.</i>

22:38.942 --> 22:42.779
<i>Hey, I'm still a part
of the family madrigal.</i>

22:42.946 --> 22:46.700
<i>And I'm fine I am totally fine</i>

22:46.867 --> 22:50.996
<i>I will stand on the side as you shine.</i>

22:52.206 --> 22:56.460
<i>I'm not fine I'm not fine</i>

22:56.710 --> 23:00.088
<i>I can't move the mountains</i>

23:00.255 --> 23:03.842
<i>I can't make flowers bloom</i>

23:04.051 --> 23:08.722
<i>I can't take another night up in my room.</i>

23:08.889 --> 23:11.642
<i>Waiting on a miracle</i>

23:11.808 --> 23:15.270
<i>I can't heal what's broken.</i>

23:15.437 --> 23:19.149
<i>Can't control the
morning rain or a hurricane.</i>

23:19.316 --> 23:23.737
<i>Can't keep down the unspoken invisible pain.</i>

23:23.904 --> 23:26.949
<i>Always waiting on a miracle
a miracle.</i>

23:27.115 --> 23:30.744
<i>Always walking alone.</i>

23:31.036 --> 23:34.623
<i>Always wanting for more.</i>

23:34.790 --> 23:39.294
<i>Like I'm still at that door
longing to shine.</i>

23:39.461 --> 23:42.214
<i>Like all of you shine.</i>

23:42.381 --> 23:45.884
<i>All I need is a change.</i>

23:46.051 --> 23:49.638
<i>All I need is a chance.</i>

23:49.847 --> 23:56.353
<i>All I know is I can't stay on the side
open your eyes.</i>

23:56.520 --> 24:00.941
<i>Open your eyes open your eyes</i>

24:01.149 --> 24:04.736
<i>I would move the mountains.</i>

24:04.903 --> 24:08.740
<i>Make new trees and flowers grow.</i>

24:08.907 --> 24:12.995
<i>Someone please just
let me know where do I go</i>

24:13.161 --> 24:16.039
<i>I am waiting on a miracle
a miracle.</i>

24:16.456 --> 24:19.376
<i>I would heal what's broken.</i>

24:19.877 --> 24:23.755
<i>Show this family something new.</i>

24:23.922 --> 24:28.051
<i>Who I am inside
so what can I do?</i>

24:28.260 --> 24:31.263
<i>I'm sick of waiting on a miracle
so here I go.</i>

24:31.805 --> 24:35.225
<i>I am ready come on, I'm ready</i>

24:35.392 --> 24:39.271
<i>I've been patient and steadfast and steady.</i>

24:39.438 --> 24:43.567
<i>Bless me now
as you blessed us all those years ago.</i>

24:43.734 --> 24:47.946
<i>When you gave us a miracle.</i>

24:49.615 --> 24:54.870
<i>Am I too late for a miracle?</i>

25:20.479 --> 25:21.479
<i>Casita?</i>

26:28.213 --> 26:29.756
Come on, <i>abuela!</i>

26:33.135 --> 26:36.680
The house is in danger!
The house is in danger!

26:37.514 --> 26:40.601
The tiles were falling,
and there were cracks everywhere.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.477
And the candle almost went out.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.356
Show me.

26:50.027 --> 26:51.445
What?

26:53.614 --> 26:55.073
No, that's...

26:56.283 --> 26:58.118
The cracks were there.

26:59.203 --> 27:01.371
They were everywhere.

27:01.538 --> 27:04.791
The house was in trouble, the candle was...

27:05.792 --> 27:07.294
<i>Abuela,</i> I promise...

27:07.461 --> 27:08.504
That's enough.

27:11.173 --> 27:14.176
There is nothing wrong
with <i>la casa madrigal.</i>

27:14.343 --> 27:16.553
The magic is strong.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.972
And so are the drinks.

27:19.223 --> 27:21.225
Please! Music!

27:35.864 --> 27:38.242
If it was all in my head,
how did I cut my hand?

27:38.617 --> 27:40.994
I would never ruin Antonio's night.

27:41.453 --> 27:43.080
Is that really what you think?

27:43.247 --> 27:46.875
What I think
is that today was very hard for you.

27:47.042 --> 27:48.210
That's...

27:49.002 --> 27:51.505
I was looking out for the family.

27:51.713 --> 27:55.008
And I might not be
super strong like luisa...

27:55.175 --> 27:58.512
Or effortlessly perfect
like <i>señorita perfecta </i> Isabela...

27:58.679 --> 28:01.139
Who's never even had a bad hair day, but...

28:02.432 --> 28:03.684
Whatever.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.359
I wish you could see yourself the way I do.

28:12.526 --> 28:16.113
You are perfect just like this.

28:16.280 --> 28:20.367
You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.247
You just healed my hand
with an <i>arepa con queso.</i>

28:25.414 --> 28:30.043
I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter...

28:30.210 --> 28:31.920
With her wonderful brain...

28:32.421 --> 28:34.840
- And big heart, cool glasses...
- Stop!

28:35.007 --> 28:36.091
<i>Mamá!</i>

28:37.467 --> 28:39.636
I know what I saw.

28:44.975 --> 28:47.603
Mira, my brother Bruno
lost his way in this family.

28:49.479 --> 28:51.315
I don't want the same for you.

28:53.192 --> 28:54.443
Get some sleep.

28:55.319 --> 28:57.237
You'll feel better tomorrow.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.159
Pedro.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.037
I need you.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.499
Cracks in our <i> casita.</i>

29:52.459 --> 29:56.547
If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...

29:58.173 --> 30:00.759
If our miracle is dying...

30:03.846 --> 30:07.349
We cannot lose our home again.

30:10.269 --> 30:11.937
Why is this happening?

30:14.106 --> 30:15.232
Open my eyes.

30:17.234 --> 30:21.488
If the answer is here, help me find it.

30:22.155 --> 30:25.242
Help me protect our family.

30:25.659 --> 30:29.538
Help me save our miracle.

30:39.006 --> 30:40.799
I will save the miracle.

30:48.807 --> 30:51.560
Wait. How do I save a miracle?

30:53.520 --> 30:56.648
I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.235
Oh, I have no idea.

31:00.402 --> 31:06.283
But there is one person in this family
who hears everything about everything.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.660
<i>So, if anyone would know what's wrong
with the magic...</i>

31:08.827 --> 31:09.661
Hey!

31:09.745 --> 31:10.745
<i>It's her.</i>

31:10.787 --> 31:11.872
Dolores, hey.

31:12.039 --> 31:14.058
You know, out of all my older cousins,
you're, like, my favorite cousin...

31:14.082 --> 31:15.560
So I feel like I can talk to you
about anything...

31:15.584 --> 31:17.252
Ergo you can talk to me about anything.

31:17.419 --> 31:20.523
Like the problem with the magic last night
that no one seemed to worry about...

31:20.547 --> 31:22.883
But maybe you heard about
that maybe I should know about.

31:23.050 --> 31:26.470
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores
so you can have seconds.

31:27.346 --> 31:28.472
Worth a shot.

31:31.517 --> 31:34.353
The only one worried about the magic
is you...

31:34.520 --> 31:36.438
And the rats talking in the walls.

31:37.356 --> 31:40.984
And luisa, I heard her eye twitching
all night.

31:43.362 --> 31:44.363
There we go.

31:44.530 --> 31:47.491
Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.541
- Luisa.
- Family.

31:55.958 --> 32:02.172
We are all thankful
for Antonio's wonderful new gift.

32:02.339 --> 32:04.383
I told them to warm up your seat.

32:04.591 --> 32:06.510
Thank you, toñito.

32:06.677 --> 32:09.972
I'm sure today we'll find a way
to put your blessings to good use.

32:10.138 --> 32:12.140
Luisa, Dolores says
you're totally freaking out.

32:12.349 --> 32:15.110
Any chance you maybe know something
about last night with the magic...

32:15.143 --> 32:16.311
- You do!
- Mirabel!

32:16.937 --> 32:18.748
- If you can't pay attention, I will help you.
- Actually...

32:18.772 --> 32:20.023
<i>Casita!</i>

32:22.401 --> 32:23.652
As I was saying...

32:24.486 --> 32:27.364
We must never take
our miracle for granted...

32:28.031 --> 32:30.576
So today we will work twice as hard.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.578
- Mm-hmm. I will help luisa.
- Stop.

32:33.745 --> 32:36.290
First, an announcement.

32:36.456 --> 32:40.961
I've spoken to the guzmáns
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.

32:41.128 --> 32:43.046
Dolores, do we have a date?

32:43.213 --> 32:45.883
Tonight. He wants five babies.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.259
Wonderful!

32:47.426 --> 32:51.054
Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela...

32:51.221 --> 32:54.683
Will bring a new generation
of magical blessings...

32:54.850 --> 32:57.561
And make both of our families stronger.

33:00.147 --> 33:03.233
Okay. Our community is counting on us.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.402
<i>La familia madrigal!</i>

33:05.569 --> 33:06.862
<i>La familia madrigal!</i>

33:07.029 --> 33:08.030
<i>La familia madrigal!</i>

33:08.238 --> 33:09.781
Luisa, hey. What?

33:13.619 --> 33:15.037
- Sorry.
- What is your problem?

33:15.204 --> 33:16.371
Hey! Luisa, hold up!

33:22.336 --> 33:24.922
- Luisa, can you re-route the river?
- Will do.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.841
- Luisa, the donkeys got out again.
- On it.

33:32.971 --> 33:33.971
Luisa!

33:34.431 --> 33:35.474
Wait a second!

33:36.225 --> 33:37.585
You gotta tell me about the magic.

33:37.643 --> 33:39.394
What's going on?
What are you hiding?

33:39.561 --> 33:43.315
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,
so maybe you should just go home.

33:43.482 --> 33:45.317
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...

33:45.609 --> 33:47.929
Dolores said your eye was twitching,
and it never twitches.

33:47.986 --> 33:49.279
Something's making you nervous.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.907
Hey, move.
You're gonna make me drop a donkey.

33:52.324 --> 33:53.325
Luisa, will you just...

33:54.368 --> 33:56.787
- Just tell me what it is.
- There's nothing to tell.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.997
You're obviously worried
about something.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.083
Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic...

34:01.250 --> 34:03.144
And it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me what's wrong...

34:03.168 --> 34:04.586
Nothing's wrong!

34:06.004 --> 34:07.673
Wow, sorry.

34:08.382 --> 34:10.342
That snuck out there.
What I meant was...

34:10.717 --> 34:12.010
Why would anything be wrong?

34:12.344 --> 34:13.655
I'm totally fine.
The magic's fine.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.473
Luisa's fine.
I'm totally not nervous.

34:17.474 --> 34:19.101
Your eye is doing the thing...

34:19.268 --> 34:22.062
<i>I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous</i>

34:22.228 --> 34:24.565
<i>I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is.</i>

34:26.149 --> 34:26.984
Okay.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.945
<i>I move mountains I move churches.</i>

34:30.112 --> 34:32.697
<i>And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is.</i>

34:32.864 --> 34:35.074
Of course, I mean...
Hey, where are you going?

34:35.242 --> 34:37.953
<i>I don't ask how hard the work is.</i>

34:38.120 --> 34:41.581
<i>Got a rough, indestructible surface
diamonds and platinum</i>

34:41.748 --> 34:42.958
<i>I find 'em I flatten 'em</i>

34:43.125 --> 34:45.710
<i>I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded.</i>

34:45.878 --> 34:51.300
<i>But under the surface, I feel berserk as
a tightrope Walker in a three-ring circus.</i>

34:51.466 --> 34:54.636
<i>Under the surface
was Hercules ever like.</i>

34:54.803 --> 34:56.597
<i>"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus".</i>

34:56.763 --> 34:58.265
<i>Under the surface</i>

34:58.432 --> 35:01.768
<i>I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
if I can't be of service.</i>

35:01.935 --> 35:03.187
<i>A flaw or a crack.</i>

35:03.353 --> 35:05.564
<i>The straw in the stack
that breaks the camel's back.</i>

35:05.731 --> 35:07.065
<i>What breaks the camel's back?</i>

35:07.232 --> 35:10.485
<i>It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip
that'll never stop.</i>

35:10.986 --> 35:11.987
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:12.654 --> 35:15.616
<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
till you just go pop.</i>

35:16.200 --> 35:17.701
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:17.910 --> 35:20.245
<i>Give it to your sister
your sister's older.</i>

35:20.412 --> 35:23.332
<i>Give her all the heavy things
we can't shoulder.</i>

35:23.498 --> 35:27.211
<i>Who am I if I can't run with the ball?</i>

35:27.419 --> 35:31.548
<i>If I fall to pressure like a grip,
grip, grip and it won't let go.</i>

35:32.257 --> 35:33.300
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:34.051 --> 35:37.012
<i>Pressure like a tick, tick, tick
till it's ready to blow.</i>

35:37.721 --> 35:39.181
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:39.348 --> 35:41.934
<i>Give it to your sister
your sister's stronger.</i>

35:42.100 --> 35:44.561
<i>See if she can hang on a little longer.</i>

35:44.728 --> 35:47.940
<i>Who am I if I can't carry it all?</i>

35:48.106 --> 35:49.900
<i>If I falter.</i>

35:50.067 --> 35:51.401
<i>Under the surface</i>

35:51.568 --> 35:55.447
<i>I hide my nerves and it worsens
I worry something is gonna hurt us.</i>

35:55.614 --> 35:57.032
<i>Under the surface.</i>

35:57.199 --> 36:00.744
<i>The ship doesn't swerve
as it heard how big the iceberg is.</i>

36:00.911 --> 36:03.830
<i>Under the surface
I think about my purpose.</i>

36:03.997 --> 36:07.125
<i>Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominos.</i>

36:07.292 --> 36:09.920
<i>A light wind blows
you try to stop it topplin'.</i>

36:10.087 --> 36:12.130
<i>But on and on it goes but wait.</i>

36:13.048 --> 36:15.050
<i>If I could shake.</i>

36:15.717 --> 36:19.847
<i>The crushing weight of expectations.</i>

36:20.013 --> 36:23.350
<i>Would that free some room up for joy.</i>

36:23.600 --> 36:25.894
<i>Or relaxation?</i>

36:26.395 --> 36:30.983
<i>Or a simple pleasure
instead we measure.</i>

36:31.900 --> 36:37.030
<i>This growing pressure keeps growing.</i>

36:37.197 --> 36:43.245
<i>Keep going 'cause all we know is.</i>

36:43.412 --> 36:46.874
<i>Pressure like a drip, drip, drip
that'll never stop.</i>

36:47.040 --> 36:48.041
<i>Whoa.</i>

36:48.792 --> 36:52.004
<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
till you just go pop.</i>

36:52.421 --> 36:53.881
<i>Whoa.</i>

36:54.047 --> 36:56.175
<i>Give it to your sister
it doesn't hurt.</i>

36:56.341 --> 36:59.178
<i>And see if she can
handle every family burden.</i>

36:59.386 --> 37:02.723
<i>Watch as she buckles
and bends but never breaks.</i>

37:04.516 --> 37:06.018
<i>No mistakes.</i>

37:06.185 --> 37:09.188
<i>Just pressure like a grip, grip, grip
and it won't let go.</i>

37:09.438 --> 37:10.689
<i>Whoa.</i>

37:11.481 --> 37:14.484
<i>Pressure like a tick, tick, tick
till it's ready to blow.</i>

37:15.110 --> 37:16.486
<i>Whoa.</i>

37:16.653 --> 37:19.323
<i>Give it to your sister and never wonder.</i>

37:19.531 --> 37:21.950
<i>If the same pressure
would have pulled you under.</i>

37:22.117 --> 37:25.120
<i>Who am I if I don't have what it takes?</i>

37:25.287 --> 37:28.332
<i>No cracks no breaks.</i>

37:28.498 --> 37:30.334
<i>No mistakes no pressure.</i>

37:39.384 --> 37:42.679
I think you're carrying way too much...

37:44.014 --> 37:46.183
Maybe I overdo it.

37:46.350 --> 37:47.643
Yep.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.771
There is something you should know.

37:50.938 --> 37:53.649
Last night, when you saw the cracks...

37:53.941 --> 37:56.693
I felt... weak.

37:57.528 --> 37:58.779
What?

37:58.946 --> 38:01.031
- Luisa! The donkeys!
- On it!

38:01.198 --> 38:02.783
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

38:03.116 --> 38:04.636
What do you think's hurting the magic?

38:04.660 --> 38:07.204
Don't know, but I heard the grown-ups once.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.081
Before <i>tío </i> Bruno left...

38:09.248 --> 38:11.917
He had, like,
some terrible vision about it.

38:12.209 --> 38:14.837
<i>Tío </i> Bruno?
What was in his vision?

38:15.003 --> 38:17.673
No one knows.
They never found it.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.301
But if something's wrong with the magic,
start with Bruno's tower.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.678
Find that vision.

38:23.178 --> 38:26.765
Wait! How do you find a vision?
What am I even looking for?

38:27.766 --> 38:29.893
If you find it, you'll know.

38:30.060 --> 38:31.228
But be careful.

38:31.395 --> 38:34.356
That place is off limits for a reason.

38:35.816 --> 38:37.317
Such a perfect match.

38:37.484 --> 38:38.485
So perfect.

38:38.652 --> 38:40.612
And so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

38:59.840 --> 39:01.133
<i>Casita.</i>

39:02.050 --> 39:05.470
Can you turn off the sand?

39:08.807 --> 39:12.060
You can't help in here?

39:14.479 --> 39:15.647
I'll be fine.

39:16.315 --> 39:17.941
I need to do this.

39:18.108 --> 39:20.694
For you, for <i>abuela...</i>

39:21.361 --> 39:23.197
Maybe a little for me.

39:24.531 --> 39:26.992
"Find the vision, save the..."

39:49.473 --> 39:50.474
Oh, hello.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.101
Lot of stairs...

39:53.769 --> 39:55.687
But at least I'll have a friend.

39:55.854 --> 39:57.898
No. He flew away immediately.

39:59.691 --> 40:00.984
All right.

40:01.151 --> 40:03.403
<i>Welcome to the family madrigal.</i>

40:04.112 --> 40:06.990
<i>There's so many stairs in the casa madrigal.</i>

40:07.741 --> 40:13.121
<i>You think there would be another way to
get so high 'cause we're magic, but no.</i>

40:13.372 --> 40:15.457
Magical how many stairs fit in here!

40:15.624 --> 40:18.252
Bruno, your room is the worst!

40:28.887 --> 40:30.055
Come on...

40:33.976 --> 40:36.019
Okay, I can do this.

41:32.618 --> 41:33.869
Quitter!

41:47.257 --> 41:48.425
Empty.

42:20.499 --> 42:22.251
What's hurting the magic?

42:55.033 --> 42:56.493
Me.

44:02.768 --> 44:05.187
Where are you coming from in such a hurry?

44:05.354 --> 44:06.480
I'm sorry I was...

44:06.647 --> 44:08.190
What is in your hair?

44:08.857 --> 44:09.983
My gift!

44:10.609 --> 44:12.486
- I'm losing my gift!
- What?

44:12.653 --> 44:15.572
Mirabel and I were having this
little talk about me carrying too much.

44:15.739 --> 44:18.659
So, I tried not to carry so much,
but I realized it was putting me behind.

44:18.742 --> 44:20.410
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.

44:20.577 --> 44:23.664
And I felt really bad,
so I was grabbing all the donkeys...

44:23.956 --> 44:27.251
But then when I went to throw
the donkeys in the barn, they were...

44:27.417 --> 44:29.127
Heavy!

44:31.922 --> 44:34.716
What did you do?
What did you say to her?

44:34.925 --> 44:36.510
Nothing. I don't...

44:36.677 --> 44:42.140
Mirabel, I have to go get the guzmáns
for Isabela's engagement.

44:42.933 --> 44:45.602
Stay away from luisa
until I can talk to her.

44:45.769 --> 44:48.397
Tonight, we can't have any more problems.

44:48.730 --> 44:51.733
And whatever you're doing,
stop doing it.

45:01.326 --> 45:03.370
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?

45:05.622 --> 45:07.249
<i>Tía!</i> jeez.

45:07.416 --> 45:09.334
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

45:09.668 --> 45:11.336
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

45:12.713 --> 45:14.713
I just wanted to get
the last of toñito's things...

45:14.756 --> 45:17.801
And then I heard the name we do not speak.

45:18.343 --> 45:22.264
Great. Now I'm thundering,
and that thunder will lead to a drizzle...

45:22.431 --> 45:24.266
And a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...

45:24.766 --> 45:27.477
Clear skies, clear skies.

45:28.896 --> 45:30.731
Clear skies.

45:32.274 --> 45:33.901
<i>Tía </i> pepa <i>? If...</i>

45:35.736 --> 45:40.657
If he had a vision about someone,
what would it mean for them?

45:40.824 --> 45:42.534
We don't talk about Bruno.

45:42.701 --> 45:46.455
I know. It's just hypothetically,
if he saw you...

45:46.622 --> 45:49.499
Mirabel, please,
we need to get ready for the guzmáns.

45:49.666 --> 45:52.836
I just wanna know if it was generally
positive or, like, less positive...

45:53.003 --> 45:54.713
- It was a nightmare!
- Félix!

45:54.880 --> 45:56.733
Hey, she needs to know, pepi,
she needs to know.

45:56.757 --> 45:57.799
We don't talk about Bruno.

45:57.966 --> 46:00.385
He would see something terrible.
And then...

46:01.720 --> 46:03.138
Boom! It would happen.

46:03.305 --> 46:04.473
We don't talk about Bruno.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.320
What if you didn't understand what he saw?

46:06.433 --> 46:09.853
Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you.

46:10.437 --> 46:14.983
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no.</i>

46:15.150 --> 46:18.862
<i>We don't talk about Bruno.</i>

46:19.863 --> 46:22.324
<i>- But it was my wedding day.
- It was our wedding day.</i>

46:22.491 --> 46:26.245
<i>We were getting ready
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

46:26.411 --> 46:28.664
<i>No clouds allowed in the sky.</i>

46:28.830 --> 46:32.376
<i>Bruno walks in
with a mischievous grin.</i>

46:32.543 --> 46:33.710
<i>Thunder.</i>

46:33.877 --> 46:35.921
<i>You're telling the story or am I?</i>

46:36.088 --> 46:37.881
<i>I'm sorry, mi vida go on.</i>

46:38.215 --> 46:40.676
<i>Bruno says it looks like rain.</i>

46:40.843 --> 46:42.594
<i>Why did he tell her?</i>

46:42.761 --> 46:44.930
<i>In doing so, he floods my brain.</i>

46:45.138 --> 46:47.307
<i>Abuela gets the umbrella.</i>

46:47.474 --> 46:49.852
<i>Married in a hurricane.</i>

46:50.018 --> 46:52.479
<i>What a joyous day but anyway.</i>

46:52.646 --> 46:57.067
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no.</i>

46:57.234 --> 47:00.404
<i>We don't talk about Bruno.</i>

47:00.571 --> 47:01.446
<i>Hey.</i>

47:01.530 --> 47:03.610
<i>Grew to live in fear of
Bruno stuttering or stumbling</i>

47:03.699 --> 47:05.868
<i>I can always hear him sort of muttering
and mumbling</i>

47:06.034 --> 47:08.871
<i>I associate him with
the sound of falling sand.</i>

47:10.539 --> 47:12.875
<i>It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling.</i>

47:13.041 --> 47:15.294
<i>Always left abuela and the family fumbling.</i>

47:15.460 --> 47:18.172
<i>Grappling with prophecies
they couldn't understand.</i>

47:18.338 --> 47:19.631
<i>Do you understand?</i>

47:19.798 --> 47:23.969
<i>Seven-foot frame
rats along his back.</i>

47:24.136 --> 47:28.599
<i>When he calls your name
it all fades to black.</i>

47:28.765 --> 47:32.936
<i>Yeah, he sees your dreams
and feasts on your screams.</i>

47:34.479 --> 47:38.859
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no.</i>

47:39.026 --> 47:43.155
<i>We don't talk about Bruno.</i>

47:43.447 --> 47:47.075
<i>He told me my fish would die
the next day dead.</i>

47:47.242 --> 47:48.243
<i>No, no.</i>

47:48.410 --> 47:51.663
<i>He told me I'd grow a gut
and just like he said.</i>

47:51.830 --> 47:54.666
-<i>No, no
</i>-<i>he said that all my hair would disappear.</i>

47:54.833 --> 47:56.418
<i>Now look at my head.</i>

47:56.585 --> 47:57.586
<i>No, no.</i>

47:57.753 --> 48:01.215
<i>Your fate is sealed
when your prophecy is read.</i>

48:01.924 --> 48:05.511
<i>He told me
that the life of my dreams.</i>

48:05.677 --> 48:09.723
<i>Would be promised and someday be mine.</i>

48:11.183 --> 48:14.811
<i>He told me that my power would grow.</i>

48:14.978 --> 48:18.273
<i>Like the grapes that thrive on the vine.</i>

48:18.982 --> 48:20.526
<i>Mariano's on his way.</i>

48:20.692 --> 48:24.530
<i>He told me that the man of my dreams.</i>

48:24.696 --> 48:27.157
<i>Would be just out of reach.</i>

48:27.324 --> 48:29.826
<i>Betrothed to another.</i>

48:30.285 --> 48:32.955
<i>- It's like I hear him now.
- Hey, sis.</i>

48:33.997 --> 48:37.292
<i>I want not a sound out of you.</i>

48:37.751 --> 48:39.670
<i>I can hear him now.</i>

48:39.837 --> 48:43.549
<i>Um, Bruno yeah, about that Bruno</i>

48:43.715 --> 48:48.262
<i>I really need to know about Bruno give
me the truth and the whole truth, Bruno.</i>

48:48.428 --> 48:51.098
<i>Isabela, your boyfriend's here!</i>

48:51.265 --> 48:53.267
<i>Time for dinner.</i>

48:53.475 --> 48:56.895
<i>- It was my wedding day.
- It was our wedding day.</i>

48:57.145 --> 49:02.901
<i>- And there wasn't a cloud in the sky.
- No clouds allowed in the sky.</i>

49:02.985 --> 49:06.154
<i>He told me that my power would grow.</i>

49:06.321 --> 49:09.616
<i>- Thunder.
- You're telling the story or am I?</i>

49:09.825 --> 49:11.785
<i>Mariano's on his way.</i>

49:11.952 --> 49:15.956
<i>- Bruno says it looks like rain.
- Why did he tell her?</i>

49:16.123 --> 49:20.752
<i>- In doing so, he floods my brain.
- Abuela gets the umbrella.</i>

49:20.919 --> 49:23.755
<i>Married in a hurricane.</i>

49:25.507 --> 49:28.302
<i>He's here
don't talk about Bruno-no.</i>

49:28.510 --> 49:31.138
<i>Why did I talk about Bruno?</i>

49:31.346 --> 49:33.098
<i>Not a word about Bruno</i>

49:33.265 --> 49:35.475
<i>I never should have brought up Bruno.</i>

49:37.561 --> 49:40.397
Miraboo!
Got your party pants on? 'Cause I...

49:46.653 --> 49:48.989
I broke into Bruno's tower.

49:49.156 --> 49:50.758
I found his last vision.
The family's in trouble.

49:50.782 --> 49:52.969
The magic is dying. The house is breaking,
luisa's gift is fading.

49:52.993 --> 49:55.829
And I think it's all because of me?

49:59.333 --> 50:00.417
<i>Pá?</i>

50:03.921 --> 50:06.965
We say nothing.
<i>Abuela </i> wants tonight to be perfect.

50:07.132 --> 50:09.760
Until the guzmáns leave,
you did not break into Bruno's tower.

50:09.927 --> 50:11.929
The magic is not dying.
The house is not breaking.

50:12.095 --> 50:13.639
Luisa's gift is not fading.

50:13.805 --> 50:16.433
No one will know.
Just act normal.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.852
No one has to know.

50:21.813 --> 50:23.440
I know.

50:25.442 --> 50:26.652
She's gonna tell everyone.

50:26.818 --> 50:28.529
Time to eat!

50:30.072 --> 50:34.868
The guzmáns and the madrigals together
will be so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

50:35.035 --> 50:39.331
Yes. Then, let's hope
tonight is not a horrible disaster.

50:40.082 --> 50:41.834
To a perfect night!

50:51.552 --> 50:52.970
Avocado?

50:58.559 --> 51:00.769
Camilo. Fix your face.

51:01.937 --> 51:02.938
Water?

51:07.943 --> 51:08.943
Mirabel.

51:09.987 --> 51:11.572
The cream, please?

51:11.780 --> 51:13.407
<i>Pá,</i> the cream?

51:17.077 --> 51:18.495
Bruno's vision.

51:19.246 --> 51:21.331
Pepa, the cloud.

51:21.498 --> 51:23.876
Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies.

51:25.127 --> 51:27.045
Bruno's vision.

51:32.259 --> 51:33.343
Mirabel?

51:34.636 --> 51:35.846
Everything okay?

51:36.847 --> 51:39.057
Everything is great.
She's just excited.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.851
For you to propose.
Which you should do!

51:41.018 --> 51:42.644
- Yes.
- As fast as you can.

51:43.145 --> 51:44.646
I was actually gonna...

51:44.813 --> 51:46.523
You were actually gonna. Great!

51:49.443 --> 51:52.446
Well, since everyone here has a talent...

51:52.613 --> 51:55.115
My Mariano wanted to
begin with a song!

51:55.282 --> 51:58.160
Luisa, could you bring over the piano?

51:58.827 --> 52:00.078
Okay.

52:01.788 --> 52:05.209
It's actually family tradition
to sing after.

52:07.503 --> 52:11.423
Isabela,
most graceful of all the madrigals.

52:14.301 --> 52:15.552
You're doing great.

52:15.886 --> 52:19.806
The most perfect flower
in this entire <i>encanto...</i>

52:19.973 --> 52:20.973
No!

52:29.525 --> 52:31.318
Will you marry...

52:31.485 --> 52:32.569
No!

52:36.448 --> 52:38.534
What is happening?

52:38.700 --> 52:40.303
Mirabel found Bruno's vision. She's in it.

52:40.327 --> 52:42.663
She's gonna destroy the magic and now,
we're all doomed!

53:12.776 --> 53:15.153
<i>Abuela,</i> please!
There's gotta be an explanation.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.613
I hate you!

53:16.822 --> 53:18.448
- I'm a loser!
- Luisa!

53:18.615 --> 53:19.700
What did you do?

53:19.867 --> 53:24.121
I'm not doing anything!
It's Bruno's vision!

53:30.002 --> 53:34.506
The magic is strong! Everything is fine!

53:34.673 --> 53:37.092
We are the madrigals!

53:37.426 --> 53:38.802
Mirabel!

54:33.690 --> 54:34.775
Hey!

54:50.582 --> 54:53.836
It's okay, <i>mami.
</i> Deep breath in, deep breath out.

54:57.673 --> 54:58.673
Stop!

55:00.759 --> 55:02.010
Stop!

55:24.992 --> 55:26.618
No! No!

55:26.785 --> 55:28.912
Help! Help...

55:29.204 --> 55:31.248
<i>Casita! Casita!</i>

55:32.416 --> 55:33.584
Help me!

55:34.001 --> 55:35.002
Help me!

55:40.340 --> 55:41.383
You're very sweaty.

55:45.888 --> 55:46.888
Oh, no!

56:00.611 --> 56:01.862
- Bye.
- What?

56:02.029 --> 56:03.614
No. Hold on!

56:03.780 --> 56:05.115
Wait! Wait!

56:05.866 --> 56:06.992
Why did you take the vision?

56:07.159 --> 56:08.386
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

56:08.410 --> 56:09.661
What does it mean?

56:09.828 --> 56:11.830
Is it why you came back or...?

56:12.706 --> 56:13.706
<i>Tío </i> Bruno?

56:13.832 --> 56:15.752
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

56:15.834 --> 56:18.921
You were never supposed to see that vision.
No one was.

56:19.087 --> 56:20.923
- But...
- A little salt.

56:22.216 --> 56:23.217
Sugar.

56:28.639 --> 56:29.639
Wait.

56:30.265 --> 56:33.227
Have you been in here patching the cracks?

56:34.186 --> 56:37.439
Oh, that? No, no, no.
I'm too scared to go near those things.

56:37.606 --> 56:39.650
All the patching's done by hernando.

56:39.816 --> 56:43.278
- Who is hernando?
- I'm hernando and I'm scared of nothing!

56:45.113 --> 56:46.615
It's actually me.

56:47.074 --> 56:48.992
I used to say my real gift was "acting."

56:50.911 --> 56:53.539
I'm Jorge. I make the spackle.

56:55.666 --> 56:58.627
How long have you been back here?

57:04.216 --> 57:05.759
You never left.

57:06.802 --> 57:10.097
Well, I left my tower, which was,
you know, a lot of stairs...

57:10.264 --> 57:12.850
And here, kitchen adjacent.

57:14.810 --> 57:17.020
Plus, free entertainment.

57:17.187 --> 57:19.106
So, what do you like?
You like sports?

57:19.565 --> 57:22.150
Game shows? Telenovelas?

57:23.819 --> 57:26.280
Their love could never be.

57:26.446 --> 57:27.990
I don't understand.

57:28.156 --> 57:30.156
Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia...

57:30.200 --> 57:32.077
So she can't remember that she's his aunt.

57:32.244 --> 57:34.746
It's like a very forbidden kind of...

57:34.913 --> 57:40.127
I don't understand why you left,
but didn't leave.

57:40.919 --> 57:45.591
Oh, well, because, the mountains
around the <i>encanto </i> are pretty tall.

57:45.757 --> 57:49.636
And like I said, free food and everything.

57:49.803 --> 57:51.889
You guys love the free food, don't ya?

57:52.264 --> 57:54.641
Always hungry. Never satisfied.

58:15.245 --> 58:18.123
My gift wasn't helping the family...

58:18.290 --> 58:20.918
But, I love my family, you know?

58:21.543 --> 58:25.255
I just don't know how to...

58:25.881 --> 58:28.342
Well, anyway,
I think you should go, because...

58:28.550 --> 58:30.862
I don't really have a good reason,
but, if I did, you'd be like...

58:30.886 --> 58:32.646
"I should go,
because that's a good reason."

58:34.598 --> 58:35.807
Why was I in your vision?

58:38.268 --> 58:39.645
<i>Tío </i> Bruno?

58:41.980 --> 58:45.984
I just wanted to make
the family proud of me.

58:46.527 --> 58:47.778
Just once.

58:49.905 --> 58:51.740
But if I should stop...

58:53.283 --> 58:55.619
If I'm hurting my family...

58:56.495 --> 58:58.372
Just tell me.

58:59.498 --> 59:01.041
I can't tell you...

59:01.959 --> 59:03.877
Because I don't know.

59:04.670 --> 59:09.049
I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your gift.

59:09.967 --> 59:11.552
Abuela <i>worried about the magic.</i>

59:11.718 --> 59:15.556
<i>So, she begged me to look into the future.
See what it meant.</i>

59:17.057 --> 59:20.269
<i>And I saw the magic in danger.</i>

59:21.144 --> 59:24.231
<i>Our house breaking.</i>

59:24.398 --> 59:28.235
<i>And then, and then, and then, I saw you.</i>

59:28.402 --> 59:31.989
<i>But the vision was different.
It would change.</i>

59:32.155 --> 59:35.409
<i>And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.</i>

59:35.576 --> 59:38.537
<i>Like your future was undecided.</i>

59:39.454 --> 59:42.016
<i>But I knew how it was gonna look.
I knew what everyone would think...</i>

59:42.040 --> 59:45.043
<i>Because I'm Bruno and everyone
always assumes the worst, so...</i>

59:46.920 --> 59:48.297
<i>So...</i>

59:49.673 --> 59:54.553
You left to protect me?

59:55.762 --> 59:57.472
I don't know which way it'll go...

59:58.307 --> 59:59.558
But my guess...

59:59.725 --> 01:00:01.977
The family, the <i>encanto</i>...

01:00:02.352 --> 01:00:04.313
And the fate of the miracle itself...

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.357
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:11.111
Or maybe I'm wrong.

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.780
You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:19.203
Look, if I could help anymore, I would...

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.413
But that's all I know.

01:00:21.747 --> 01:00:24.625
Good luck.
I wish I could've seen more.

01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:26.919
Yeah.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.132
Yeah.

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.761
You wish you could have seen more,
so see more!

01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:37.888
Have another vision.

01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:40.432
No, no.
See, I don't do visions anymore.

01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.808
- But you could.
- But I won't.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.979
You can't say the weight of the world
is on your shoulders. The end.

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:49.900
If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.027
Maybe it'll show me what to do.

01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:56.031
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,
you wrecked my vision cave.

01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:58.700
Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.

01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.452
- We'll find one.
- Where?

01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:01.620
Use my room.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:05.874
The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.

01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:14.174
Our family needs help,
and you need to get outta here.

01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:33.902
You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.070
Think of the family.

01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:37.281
I was thinking of my daughter.

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.700
Pepa, calm down.

01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:41.118
- I'm doing my best.
- Yes.

01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:42.911
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:46.540
<i>Mamá,</i> you've always been
too hard on mirabel.

01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.125
Look around.

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:53.338
We must protect our family, our e <i>ncanto.
</i> We cannot lose our home.

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:59.011
People in town are becoming anxious
about the magic.

01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:00.429
They want to see you.

01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:03.724
Mirabel was in that vision for a reason.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.059
Find her.

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.942
We might wanna hurry.

01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:16.320
You can't hurry the future.

01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:20.991
What if I show you something worse?

01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.619
If I see something that you don't like,
you're gonna be all...

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:27.664
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's
creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.459
I don't think you make bad things happen.

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:35.422
Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:37.424
You can do this.

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.179
For the nerves.

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.686
I can do this. I can do this,
I can do this, I can do this.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.722
You might wanna hang on.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.551
It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!

01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:07.264
No. I need to know which way it goes.
There's gotta be an answer.

01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:08.599
Something we're not seeing!

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:10.485
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.162
- If there was something else...
- There!

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:13.604
Over there!

01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:15.396
Butterfly!

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:16.940
Follow the butterfly!

01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.447
Where is that?

01:04:23.864 --> 01:04:25.782
It's all out of order.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:30.621
It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:33.290
- I think you're gonna help the candle!
- How?

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:35.334
There's someone with you.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.836
- And you fight her!
- What?

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.588
Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?

01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:40.756
Am I fighting or hugging?

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:43.717
An embrace. An embrace!

01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:45.886
To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.

01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.346
Embrace who?

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:48.931
Almost there.

01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.891
- Who is it?
- Almost there.

01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:52.809
I got it!

01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.104
Isabela?

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.529
Your sister? That's great!

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:06.782
Every time.

01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:11.078
Why would embracing Isabela
do anything?

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:14.125
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.
How do you help a family miracle?

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.249
You hug a sister.

01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:18.460
Mirabel? Mirabel?

01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:21.463
Mirabel?

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.590
Well,
I think we're running out of time here.

01:05:23.757 --> 01:05:25.133
It's not gonna work.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.303
She won't hug me ever, okay?
She hates me!

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.931
Also, I don't know if you heard,
I ruined her proposal!

01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:33.600
- Plus, p.S., she is just annoying.
- Mirabel?

01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.477
- Of course it's Isabela!
- Mirabel?

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:37.004
What's her problem with me anyway?

01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.540
She's the one with roses
coming out of her...

01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:39.731
Mirabel!

01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:41.400
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:43.402
You see, you're missing the point.

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.071
The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.614
It's up to you.

01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:51.493
You're exactly what this family needs.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.371
You just have to see it.

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:57.165
By yourself, after I leave.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.043
What, you're not coming?

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:04.006
It was your vision, mirabel. Not mine.

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.591
You're afraid <i>abuela </i> will see you.

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.718
Yep. I mean, yes, that too.

01:06:09.928 --> 01:06:13.432
Hey, after you save the miracle,
come visit.

01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:18.854
After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.900
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:38.248
You got this.
Just gonna save the miracle.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.667
With a hug.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:44.671
Isa? Hey.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.425
I know we've had our issues...

01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:54.389
But I'm ready to be a better sister...
To you.

01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:57.100
So, we should just hug.

01:06:57.518 --> 01:06:59.853
Let's hug it out, huh?

01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:03.315
"Hug it out"?

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:07.027
Luisa can't lift an empanada <i>...</i>

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:11.406
Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!

01:07:11.949 --> 01:07:13.492
Have you lost your mind?

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:17.955
Isa, I feel like you're upset.

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:21.917
And you know what cures being upset?
A warm embrace.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.044
Get out.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.422
Everything was perfect.

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:29.800
<i>Abuela </i> was happy. The family was happy.

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:35.764
You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.

01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:43.021
Go on. Apologize.

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:47.776
I...

01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:50.529
Am...

01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:52.698
Sorry...

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.287
- That your life is so great!
- Out.

01:07:58.453 --> 01:08:01.164
Wait! Fine! I apologize!

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.418
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.880
Some of us have bigger problems...

01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:10.549
You selfish, entitled Princess!

01:08:10.716 --> 01:08:11.967
"Selfish"?

01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:16.889
I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:20.850
And literally, the only thing you have ever
done for me is mess things up!

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:24.479
Nothing is messed up!
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!

01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:28.524
I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!

01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:32.279
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:32.738 --> 01:08:33.779
Isa...

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:37.576
That is a very serious confession.

01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.412
Okay, get over here.

01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:41.705
Bring it in.

01:08:42.287 --> 01:08:43.287
Isa?

01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.296
<i>I just made something unexpected.</i>

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.301
<i>Something sharp something new.</i>

01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:56.678
Isa? This is the part where we...

01:08:56.845 --> 01:09:00.682
<i>It's not symmetrical or perfect
but it's beautiful.</i>

01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:04.810
<i>And it's mine
what else can I do?</i>

01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:06.354
<i>Wait bring it in, bring it in.</i>

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:08.857
<i>- Good talk, bring it in, bring it in.
- What else can I do?</i>

01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.776
<i>Let's hug
bring it in, bring it in.</i>

01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:12.263
<i>Free hugs
bring it in, bring it in</i>

01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:16.113
<i>I grow rows and rows of roses.</i>

01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:20.452
<i>Flor de Mayo by the mile</i>

01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:24.790
<i>I make perfect, practiced poses.</i>

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:28.752
<i>So much hides behind my smile.</i>

01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:34.131
<i>What could I do if I just grew
what I was feeling in the moment?</i>

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:36.134
<i>Do you know where you're going?</i>

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:41.223
<i>What could I do if I just knew
it didn't need to be perfect?</i>

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.643
<i>It just needed to be
and they let me be.</i>

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:48.522
<i>A hurricane of jacarandás.</i>

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.399
-<i>Strangling figs, hanging vines
</i>-<i>fig!</i>

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:52.901
<i>This is fine.</i>

01:09:53.068 --> 01:09:58.991
<i>Palma de cera fills the air
as I climb and I push through.</i>

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:01.410
<i>What else can I do?</i>

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:05.873
<i>Can I deliver us a river of sundew?</i>

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:09.835
<i>Careful, it's carnivorous
a little just won't do</i>

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:13.297
<i>I wanna feel the shiver of something new.</i>

01:10:13.964 --> 01:10:17.050
<i>I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true, don't you?</i>

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:22.347
<i>You just seemed like your life's been a
dream since the moment you opened your eyes.</i>

01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:24.725
<i>How far do these roots go down?</i>

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:28.020
<i>All I know are the blossoms you grow.</i>

01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:30.689
<i>But it's awesome to see how
you rise.</i>

01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.691
<i>- How far can I rise?
- How far can you rise?</i>

01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:36.820
<i>Through the roof to the skies
let's go.</i>

01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:40.324
<i>A hurricane of jacarandás.</i>

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.284
<i>-Strangling figs -go.</i>

01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.870
<i>-Hanging vines -grow.</i>

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:50.876
<i>Palma de cera fills the air
as I climb and I push through.</i>

01:10:51.043 --> 01:10:52.794
<i>What else? What else?</i>

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:57.549
<i>What can you do when you are
deeply madly truly in the moment?</i>

01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.802
<i>Seize the moment keep going.</i>

01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:05.015
<i>What can you do when you know
who you want to be isn't perfect?</i>

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:08.644
<i>- But I'll still be okay.
- Hey, everybody clear the way</i>

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:12.648
<i>- I'm coming through with tabebuia.
- Tabebuia.</i>

01:11:12.814 --> 01:11:14.525
<i>-Making waves -making waves.</i>

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.069
-<i>Changing minds
</i>-<i>you've changed mine.</i>

01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:19.488
<i>The way is clearer 'cause you're here.</i>

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:23.033
<i>And well, I owe this all to you.</i>

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.952
<i>What else can I do?</i>

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.037
<i>Show them what you can do.</i>

01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:30.916
<i>- What else can I do?
- There's nothing you can't do.</i>

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.545
<i>What else can I do?</i>

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.465
You're a bad influence.

01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:41.218
What is going on?

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.012
<i>Abuela</i> ? It's okay! Everything's...

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:45.889
We're gonna save the miracle.
The magic...

01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.516
What are you talking about?

01:11:47.683 --> 01:11:50.018
Look at our home! Look at your sister!

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:53.230
Please just...
Isabela wasn't happy.

01:11:53.438 --> 01:11:55.566
Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.

01:11:55.732 --> 01:11:58.026
No, no, no.
She needed me to ruin her proposal.

01:11:58.193 --> 01:11:59.695
And then we did all this!

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:01.130
And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...

01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:02.823
- Mirabel.
- That's why I'm in the vision!

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:04.241
I'm saving the miracle!

01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:06.785
You have to stop, mirabel!

01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:11.790
The cracks started with you.

01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:14.751
Bruno left because of you.

01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:18.380
Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.

01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:20.215
Because of you!

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.135
I don't know why you
weren't given a gift...

01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:27.181
But it is not an excuse
for you to hurt this family.

01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:42.154
I will never be good enough for you.

01:12:43.197 --> 01:12:44.281
Will I?

01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:50.454
No matter how hard I try.

01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:59.671
No matter how hard any of us tries.

01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:04.009
Luisa will never be strong enough.

01:13:04.176 --> 01:13:07.221
Isabela won't be perfect enough.

01:13:07.387 --> 01:13:10.224
Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.434
Bruno didn't care about this family.

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:13.977
He loves this family.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:17.981
I love this family.
We all love this family.

01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:19.900
You're the one that doesn't care.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:23.028
- You're the one breaking our home.
- Don't you ever...

01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:25.864
The miracle is dying, because of you.

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:32.204
No, no, no!

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.956
The candle!

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.257
<i>Casita! </i> Get me up there!

01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:56.854
No!

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.361
No!

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:18.166
Careful, Antonio!

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.460
We gotta get out of here!

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:22.462
Mirabel! Mirabel!

01:14:23.046 --> 01:14:25.424
Mirabel, we have to get out!

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:37.519
- Mirabel!
- Mirabel!

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.104
Mirabel, leave it!

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:46.653
Mirabel! The house is going to fall!

01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:51.783
- Mirabel, get out!
- Mirabel!

01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:21.980
No.

01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:34.201
Mirabel!

01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:38.121
Mirabel, are you hurt?

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.417
Mirabel!

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.044
Julieta, come quick!

01:15:44.545 --> 01:15:45.546
Julieta!

01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.090
Don't move. I'll be right back.

01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:52.469
How did this happen?

01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:55.180
Here, let me help you.
Let me help you.

01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:58.183
- Everyone okay?
- Antonio, don't cry, <i>papito.</i>

01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:01.728
How is this possible? The <i>encanto's</i> broken.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:03.146
What do we do now?

01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:05.232
My powers. They're gone.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.484
What about Antonio?
What is he gonna do?

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:14.616
Mirabel?

01:16:15.242 --> 01:16:17.828
Mirabel! Where's mirabel?

01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:19.162
Where is she?

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:20.581
Mirabel!

01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:22.791
Mirabel?

01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:25.711
Mirabel!

01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:38.974
Mirabel?

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:43.562
Mirabel!

01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:47.524
Mirabel!

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:49.902
They haven't found her yet?

01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:52.696
- Mirabel!
- Mirabel!

01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:54.823
Mirabel!

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.510
Mirabel.

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.061
I'm sorry.

01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:28.482
I didn't want to hurt us.

01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:31.652
I just wanted...

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:35.072
To be something I'm not.

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:53.632
I've never been able to come back here.

01:17:56.385 --> 01:18:02.683
This river is where we were given
our miracle.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:07.813
Where <i>abuelo</i> Pedro...

01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:14.570
I thought we would have a different life.

01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:19.366
I thought I would be a different woman.

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.141
<i>I was given a miracle.</i>

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.604
<i>A second chance.</i>

01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:00.652
<i>And I was so afraid to lose it...</i>

01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:08.368
<i>That I lost sight of who
our miracle was for.</i>

01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:15.667
<i>And I am so sorry.</i>

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:21.131
<i>You never hurt our family, mirabel.</i>

01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.009
<i>We are broken...</i>

01:21:28.305 --> 01:21:30.265
Because of me.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.114
<i>Abuela.</i>

01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:49.826
I can finally see.

01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:56.959
You lost your home.

01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:01.296
Lost everything.

01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:05.801
You suffered so much...

01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:07.803
All alone...

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:11.598
So it would never happen again.

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:17.020
We were saved because of you.

01:22:17.896 --> 01:22:21.775
We were given a miracle,
because of you.

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:26.613
We are a family, because of you.

01:22:27.406 --> 01:22:30.534
And nothing could ever be broken

01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:34.496
that we can't fix... together.

01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:42.462
I asked my Pedro for help.

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.175
Mirabel.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.470
He sent me you.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.044
She didn't do this!

01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:25.047
She didn't do this!

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.592
I gave her a vision!

01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:31.470
It was me!

01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:34.014
I was, like, "go!"
And she was, like...

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.058
She only wanted to help.

01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:40.270
I don't care what you think of me,
but if you're too stubborn to...

01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:43.315
<i>Brunito.</i>

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:48.904
I feel like I missed something important.

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:50.989
Come on.

01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:01.333
What's happening? Where are we going?

01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.127
Home.

01:24:10.717 --> 01:24:12.344
It's her! I found her!

01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:13.887
I found her!

01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:16.098
She's back! She's back, she's back!

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.402
Mirabel!

01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:32.656
Mirabel!

01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:35.074
<i>Mamá.</i>

01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:37.452
<i>Mi amor,</i> I was so worried.

01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:39.162
We couldn't find you.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.124
There were bees everywhere.

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:45.294
I'll be okay.

01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:48.797
Not if we don't have a house.

01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:51.466
What? We don't have a house.
I can't say we don't have a house?

01:24:51.633 --> 01:24:53.051
What is that? Not a house.

01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:05.564
<i>Look at this home
we need a new foundation.</i>

01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:09.860
<i>It may seem hopeless
but we'll get by just fine.</i>

01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:14.406
<i>Look at this family
a glowing constellation.</i>

01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:19.369
<i>So full of stars
and everybody wants to shine.</i>

01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:25.125
<i>But the stars don't shine, they burn.</i>

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:29.004
<i>And the constellations shift.</i>

01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:34.301
<i>I think it's time you learn.</i>

01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:37.721
<i>You're more than just your gift.</i>

01:25:37.888 --> 01:25:41.350
<i>And I'm sorry I held on too tight.</i>

01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:46.146
<i>Just so afraid I'd lose you too.</i>

01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:49.942
<i>The miracle is not
some magic that you've got.</i>

01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:51.818
<i>The miracle is you.</i>

01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:54.655
<i>Not some gift just you.</i>

01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.156
<i>The miracle is you.</i>

01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:58.534
<i>All of you all of you.</i>

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:02.538
<i>Okay so
we gonna talk about Bruno?</i>

01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:03.914
<i>That's Bruno?</i>

01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:07.209
<i>Yeah
there's a lot to say about Bruno</i>

01:26:07.376 --> 01:26:09.376
<i>I'll start, okay
pepa, I'm sorry about your wedding.</i>

01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:10.541
<i>Didn't mean to be upsetting.</i>

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:12.607
<i>That wasn't a prophecy
I could just see you were sweating.</i>

01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:14.631
<i>And I wanted you to know
that your bro loves you so.</i>

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.475
<i>Let it in, let it out
let it rain, let it snow.</i>

01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:17.386
<i>Let it go.</i>

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:18.913
<i>That's what I'm always saying, bro</i>

01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:20.639
<i>I got a lot of apologies I got to say.</i>

01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.975
<i>Hey, we're just happy that you're here,
okay?</i>

01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:25.021
<i>- Come into the light.
- That trip was only a night.</i>

01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:27.271
<i>And no matter what happens
we're gonna find our way.</i>

01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:29.565
<i>Yo, I knew he never left
I heard him every day.</i>

01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:34.695
<i>What's that sound?</i>

01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:37.739
<i>I think it's everyone in town.</i>

01:26:39.283 --> 01:26:40.117
<i>Hey.</i>

01:26:40.284 --> 01:26:44.246
<i>Lay down your load
lay down your load.</i>

01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:48.000
<i>Roll me down the road
roll me down the road.</i>

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:52.296
<i>We have no gifts but we are many.</i>

01:26:53.046 --> 01:26:56.508
<i>And we'll do anything for you.</i>

01:26:56.675 --> 01:27:01.096
<i>It's a dream when we work as a team
you're so strong.</i>

01:27:01.263 --> 01:27:04.850
-<i>Yeah, but sometimes I cry
</i>-<i>so do I</i>

01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:07.102
<i>I may not be as strong
but I'm getting wiser.</i>

01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:09.021
<i>Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer.</i>

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:11.690
<i>Come on
let's plant something new and watch it fly.</i>

01:27:11.857 --> 01:27:13.400
<i>Straight up to the sky.</i>

01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:15.152
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:19.114
<i>The stars don't shine, they burn.</i>

01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:22.910
<i>The constellations glow.</i>

01:27:23.493 --> 01:27:27.039
<i>The seasons change in turn.</i>

01:27:27.748 --> 01:27:30.584
<i>Would you watch our little girl go.</i>

01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:33.003
<i>She takes after you.</i>

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:36.965
<i>Hey, Mariano why so blue?</i>

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:41.887
<i>I just have so much love inside.</i>

01:27:42.888 --> 01:27:46.892
<i>You know, I've got this cousin too
have you met Dolores?</i>

01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:49.269
Okay, I'll take it from here.
Goodbye!

01:27:49.728 --> 01:27:50.938
<i>You talk so loud.</i>

01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:52.874
<i>You take care of your mother
and you make her proud.</i>

01:27:52.898 --> 01:27:55.001
<i>You write your own poetry
every night when you go to sleep.</i>

01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:57.425
<i>And I'm seizing the moment
so would you wake up and notice me</i>

01:27:57.569 --> 01:27:59.821
Dolores, I see you.

01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:00.988
And I hear you.

01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:01.865
Yes!

01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:03.700
<i>All of you all of you.</i>

01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:05.827
- Let's get married.
- Slow down.

01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:08.247
<i>All of you all of you.</i>

01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:14.002
<i>Home sweet home
I like the new foundation.</i>

01:28:14.169 --> 01:28:16.004
<i>It isn't perfect.</i>

01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:18.090
-<i>Neither are we</i> -<i>that's true.</i>

01:28:18.257 --> 01:28:21.969
<i>Just one more thing before the celebration.</i>

01:28:22.177 --> 01:28:24.221
- <i>What?
</i>- <i>We need a doorknob.</i>

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.014
We made this one for you.

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:40.779
<i>We see how bright you burn.</i>

01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:47.911
<i>We see how brave you've been.</i>

01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:54.126
<i>Now see yourself in turn.</i>

01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:59.506
<i>You're the real gift, kid
let us in.</i>

01:29:00.716 --> 01:29:03.010
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:10.309
What do you see?

01:29:12.686 --> 01:29:15.981
I see... me.

01:29:18.692 --> 01:29:20.360
<i>All of me.</i>

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.372
Come on! Get in here!

01:30:29.012 --> 01:30:30.012
Yeah!

01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:44.194
Yeah, <i>amor!</i>

01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:55.455
Everyone, together...

01:30:55.622 --> 01:30:58.041
<i>La familia madrigal!</i>
