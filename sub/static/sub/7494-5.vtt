WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:02.370
Last time on
Make It Pop.

00:02.403 --> 00:05.106
Corki, you're
so mysterious!

00:05.139 --> 00:06.074
Ow!

00:06.107 --> 00:08.076
A DNA sample, really?

00:08.109 --> 00:09.843
You stole those dance
moves from me.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.345
I think you
should step off.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.347
Well, I think you
should dance off.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.948
Looks like your little
music career is over

00:14.982 --> 00:16.016
before it's begun.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.986
Since when is football
game attendance mandatory?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.788
It's in the school
charter, Caleb.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.956
The Founding Fathers
were real sports nuts.

00:22.990 --> 00:26.794
But our debut,
that'll ruin everything.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.196
Oh well.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.463
A little
higher, girls.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.166
Higher.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.869
Perfect!

00:37.271 --> 00:38.772
No it's not!

00:40.908 --> 00:43.877
*

00:43.911 --> 00:47.348
Mr. Stark, the student
body has spoken.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.383
That makes you
the mouth.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.484
What is this?

00:50.518 --> 00:53.020
A petition to stop
the madness.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.224
Eighty seven
seniors have signed.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.993
Four signatures
by Valerie Graves?

01:00.027 --> 01:01.229
A typo, I'm sure.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.232
But regardless, I am not the
only one with deep objections to

01:04.265 --> 01:06.834
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.003
MacKendrick Prep needs a
play of weight, matter--

01:10.037 --> 01:12.340
And a male lead.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.008
I applaud your passion,
and I'll give this

01:15.042 --> 01:17.378
every consideration
it deserves.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.412
Thank you, sir.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.420
Sun-Hi: Our first
club date.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.188
This is huge!

01:27.221 --> 01:28.289
I don't know.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.891
On the one hand, singing in
front of all those people

01:30.924 --> 01:31.825
would be so cool.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.195
On the other hand,
what if my dad finds out?

01:34.228 --> 01:37.165
On the other hand,
why do I have so many hands?

01:37.198 --> 01:39.933
Don't worry, we'll just figure
out a way to disguise you.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.502
Besides, I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.305
No one knows Sun Hi
wears a night guard to bed.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.106
(laughing)

01:46.140 --> 01:47.175
Wow.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.310
Plus I'll be on stage
so no one will be watching

01:49.343 --> 01:50.944
either of you, anyway.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.414
This is bad,
bad, bad, bad.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.248
Caleb?

01:54.282 --> 01:56.384
Football season
opens Friday night!

01:56.417 --> 01:59.086
Everyone's gonna be at the
game instead of our concert.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.188
What?!

02:00.221 --> 02:01.922
Corki, you're the one who's
supposed to be on top

02:01.955 --> 02:04.192
of all of the "school-y"
things going on around here!

02:04.225 --> 02:06.194
How did we not
know about this?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.961
"School-y"
isn't a word.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.130
Well how would you
say "school-y things?"

02:10.164 --> 02:11.965
School related
miscellanea?

02:11.999 --> 02:15.836
Oh, now she's back to
being all smart again.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.406
It's not my fault, none of us
knew about the football game!

02:18.439 --> 02:19.973
She's right!

02:20.007 --> 02:22.276
Don't worry, there has
to be a reasonable solution

02:22.310 --> 02:23.811
that satisfies
everyone.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.881
I got this.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.421
Hey guys, can I talk to
you for a minute.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.456
(crashing)

02:37.024 --> 02:37.625
Guys?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.260
Are you out there?

02:39.293 --> 02:40.461
Hello?

02:41.128 --> 02:45.098
(banging)

02:45.132 --> 02:47.935
Guess you'll be dancing
with yourselves Friday night.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.272
Goooooo Beagles!

02:54.342 --> 02:57.511
She may have zinged me,
but mark my words,

02:57.545 --> 03:00.147
she'll be the last
to get zung.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.282
"Zung"
isn't a word.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.383
It's a word!

03:03.584 --> 03:06.920
* Make it pop!
Woo, Woo*

03:06.954 --> 03:10.090
* Make it pop! Woo, Woo

03:10.123 --> 03:12.426
* I can't wait, no,
I can't wait, no *

03:12.460 --> 03:16.664
* I can't wait,
can't wait, can't wait *

03:16.697 --> 03:18.266
* So make it pop!

03:18.299 --> 03:20.534
* We're bout to,
we're bout to blow! *

03:20.568 --> 03:23.371
* Until we drop, Oh yeah
we're ready to go *

03:23.404 --> 03:27.275
* Ain't gonna stop,
When is it time for the show? *

03:27.308 --> 03:30.244
* We make it, you make it,
we make it *

03:30.278 --> 03:32.480
* M-m-m-m-m-make it pop!

03:35.949 --> 03:37.585
Just explain to your
boss what happened,

03:37.618 --> 03:41.188
then politely ask him to switch
the date of the concert.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.157
Sure, he's a
reasonable man.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.226
Tell him his
shadow looks slim.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.330
Sir, it's
Caleb Davis.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.164
I'd just
like to say that,

03:51.198 --> 03:54.635
your silhouette looks
especially slim today.

03:54.668 --> 03:58.672
We're supposed to have a
concert here tomorrow night,

03:58.706 --> 04:02.576
sir, but there's a slight
issue with a football game.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.212
What's that?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.315
Fail, and
you'll be fired.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.317
Oh, I'll be
fired, right.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.451
Very clear, sir.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.585
Yes, sir.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.422
O--Okay.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.992
Sun-Hi: Soooo,
what'd he say?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.561
He said we can't
change the date.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.029
We need a new plan.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.264
Who's got an idea?

04:24.298 --> 04:29.970
Here's one: How about we totally
follow the rules and attend

04:30.003 --> 04:32.440
the mandatory game like
we're supposed to, yeah?

04:32.473 --> 04:33.541
Guys.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.075
What do I always say?

04:35.108 --> 04:38.312
"Get away from the
mirror, it's my turn?"

04:38.346 --> 04:40.080
No.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.418
When the going gets tough,
the tough start vlogging!

04:44.452 --> 04:46.219
I don't think
that's how it goes.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.221
I'll get the word
out on the best

04:48.255 --> 04:49.289
local music
podcast in town.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.759
I'll make sure Corki goes
back through the whole

04:51.792 --> 04:55.329
school handbook in case there's
something else she missed.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.498
Nobody ever said
this would be easy.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.102
Ahem,
ahem, ahem.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
I'm here to see
the man in charge.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.238
Name?

05:05.272 --> 05:07.441
It's Caleb Davis,
a high school DJ.

05:07.475 --> 05:11.645
I need help promoting
a show tomorrow.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.146
Did I say high school?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.148
I meant I'm a highly
prominent music producer

05:15.182 --> 05:16.484
and a fully grown adult.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.123
Technical support, hmm.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.292
Hmph!

05:25.325 --> 05:28.061
I would like to
accept this award

05:28.095 --> 05:30.063
and I should probably
thank all the little

05:30.097 --> 05:32.633
people along the way,
but I won't.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.735
Why shou--

05:34.768 --> 05:37.805
We few, we happy few,
we band of brothers--

05:37.838 --> 05:40.040
Students usually
need to make appointments

05:40.073 --> 05:42.776
before barging in here,
reciting Shakespeare.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.344
No time for that,
Mr. Stark.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.179
Imagine an entire night of
me motivating

05:46.213 --> 05:48.482
King Henry the Fifth's troops--
A-K-A the audience,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.484
--to a heroic frenzy,
that'll be the highlight

05:50.518 --> 05:52.319
of your theater career.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.288
It's truly beyond
my imagination.

05:55.322 --> 05:59.359
MacKendrick Prep is ready
for something that moves,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.261
enlightens
and empowers--

06:01.294 --> 06:03.230
everything that is
MacKendrick Prep.

06:03.263 --> 06:07.234
And you have in front of you the
man-- child who can deliver it.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.270
Ahem, ahem!

06:10.303 --> 06:12.740
The show's set,
Mr. Anderson.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.843
I've spent months writing a
very special adaptation of

06:15.876 --> 06:18.646
L. Frank Baum's
classic book.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.181
The play
remains the same.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.283
This conversation
is not over.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.653
But right now, I gotta
get out of this chainmail.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.887
It's starting to chafe.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.757
Also, the cafeteria lady doesn't
know I borrowed her sandals.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.396
Just watch
the door, ok!

06:41.201 --> 06:42.736
Alright folks, I'm
taking off but,

06:42.770 --> 06:44.538
you be you
and I'll be me.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.774
One plus one plus
one is three.

06:46.807 --> 06:51.479
I'm DJ Maxwell, and this
is the Max Attack.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
Mr. Maxwell, sir.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.750
Who are you?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.385
I'm the
audio engineer.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.855
What happened to
my regular I.T. guy, you know?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.391
The one who quietly judges
me for not understanding

07:04.424 --> 07:05.626
a word that
he's saying.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.866
Sir, my name is Caleb Davis and
I came here to tell you about

07:12.900 --> 07:14.602
my great new band.

07:14.635 --> 07:19.640
I appreciate your ingenuity
in the face of desperation.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.874
Kinda cool, man.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.142
Thank you.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.410
Security!

07:23.443 --> 07:26.279
Wait, we need people to show up
to our concert tomorrow night!

07:26.313 --> 07:28.749
And, uh, ple--

07:28.782 --> 07:30.918
Be careful with this
one, he's some sort

07:30.951 --> 07:32.219
of brooding artist.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.821
No wait, you're
making a mistake!

07:33.854 --> 07:35.623
This-- this band is
something special!

07:35.656 --> 07:37.457
We just need a chance.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.125
(cellphone dings)

07:38.158 --> 07:39.727
It's Caleb.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.730
He says he didn't have
any luck with the podcast.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.432
The Sun Hi Nation
isn't responding either.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.701
You mean your family isn't
coming in from Maryland?

07:47.735 --> 07:50.337
I have other fans.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.273
An aunt in
New Jersey.

07:53.306 --> 07:53.841
Arghh!

07:53.874 --> 07:55.242
Why isn't anyone coming?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.210
Sun Hi, maybe
you need a rest.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.280
Don't you get it,
this is our shot.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.316
It's everything we've
been waiting for.

08:03.350 --> 08:11.859
*

08:11.892 --> 08:14.695
* Ah, ah ah, aah

is wearing my line *

10:07.540 --> 10:09.743
* We're 'bout to,
we're bout to blow *

10:09.777 --> 10:12.913
* Wait 'til we drop,
Oh yeah we're ready to go *

10:12.946 --> 10:16.016
* Ain't gonna stop when is
it time for the show *

10:16.049 --> 10:18.819
* We make it,
you make, we make it *

10:18.852 --> 10:21.421
* M-m-m-m-m
make it pop *

10:22.089 --> 10:24.825
This means everything.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.492
(cellphone dings)

10:25.525 --> 10:27.560
Corki: Wait, a reply.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.463
"Sun Hi, can't make it,
Love, Mom."

10:30.497 --> 10:33.466
No, the nation
is collapsing!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.002
Mom was the
charter member!

10:37.905 --> 10:39.707
Are you all right?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.075
Did our lead singer
just lose her voice?

10:43.043 --> 10:45.478
I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.615
Ladies,
commence freak out!

10:48.648 --> 10:53.020
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

10:55.789 --> 10:57.991
Say ahh,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.693
Oh my--

10:59.727 --> 11:01.561
She wants to know
what that means.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.030
You can follow that?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.164
Of course.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.734
I was a Junior Charades
Champion, five years running.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.136
I also speak Latin,
five romance languages,

11:09.169 --> 11:13.673
and I can communicate with a
rare species of Chinese dolphin.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.975
Sun Hi says,
I'm a show-off.

11:15.008 --> 11:15.976
Jodi says,
I'm agreeing.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.912
I was just gonna say,
she has impeccable teeth

11:18.946 --> 11:20.547
Nurse: There's no
reddening or stress.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.851
It's most likely
psychosomatic.

11:23.884 --> 11:28.388
I had a good life,
it's time for me to move on.

11:28.421 --> 11:32.392
Jodi, please take my back
up phone as a special gift.

11:32.425 --> 11:36.029
Corki, you reveal nothing of
your personal details,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.931
so, i give you
nothing in return.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.033
Sun Hi, you're fine.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.435
This is usually
caused by nerves.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.172
Sometimes the voice
just comes back, other times,

11:45.205 --> 11:48.141
a patient gets a good scare
and their voice returns.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.610
She wants to know
what we're going to do

11:50.643 --> 11:51.678
about tonight's show.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.446
Only time will tell.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.116
Or you could bill
yourselves as mimes!

11:56.149 --> 12:02.022
(laughing)

12:03.156 --> 12:04.758
What does that mean?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.927
She is either freaking
out about tonight

12:06.960 --> 12:09.062
or she wants
some potato salad.

12:09.930 --> 12:14.101
*

12:14.134 --> 12:15.803
There's no historical
precedent for students

12:15.836 --> 12:17.704
getting out of the
football game.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.039
It's not going
to happen.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.643
She says,
she has an idea.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.712
She figured out
how to sing with us!

12:25.745 --> 12:27.114
Jodi: That's great, how?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.783
Computer: I can use my
computer's voice.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.452
Maybe no one will
notice the difference.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.122
Come on, girls.

12:35.155 --> 12:35.789
Sing with me.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.658
La la la la la la la.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.862
As impressive as that was,
I don't think it'll work.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.665
What if I do an
interpretive dance?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.846
Beagles swim,
sharks drown!

12:58.879 --> 13:01.048
At MacKendrick Prep,
it's Beagle town!

13:01.081 --> 13:03.783
Go Beagles!

13:04.517 --> 13:05.919
Wow, Valerie.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.554
That was excellent.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.121
That jump?

13:08.155 --> 13:08.956
So graceful.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.490
And your poster?

13:10.523 --> 13:12.725
Very descriptive.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.962
I'm not going
to help you.

13:14.995 --> 13:15.963
What if I begged?

13:15.996 --> 13:16.663
Maybe.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.665
Pleeeaaseee!?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.133
No.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.103
Your event will be a disaster
and you're going to get

13:23.136 --> 13:25.105
in trouble for not
going to the game.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.708
But if I don't fill that club,
I'll lose my job.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.709
Oh no!

13:29.742 --> 13:32.245
You didn't say you were
going to lose your job!

13:32.279 --> 13:33.813
Still don't care.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.714
Byeeeeee.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.517
Maybe you
didn't hear me.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.219
Oh, I heard you
all right.

13:39.252 --> 13:43.256
But now hear me, I'm a senior
with a four point-five GPA.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.293
My IQ is 162 and
I can do the splits.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.661
You have
nothing to offer me.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.733
Don't tell anyone
about my IQ.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.036
I like to be
underestimated.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.506
Go Beagles!

14:06.113 --> 14:07.014
Ahhhhhh!

14:07.948 --> 14:08.848
We were trying
to scare you.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.184
The nurse said it might
snap you out of it

14:11.218 --> 14:13.020
and bring your
voice back.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.088
Corki: Does it look
like it worked?

14:15.122 --> 14:16.056
Of course not.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.925
If we really
wanted to scare her,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.259
we should've taken
away her cellphone.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.361
We should
just cancel.

14:24.031 --> 14:28.001
"We can't cancel our debut,
It'll destroy our reputation."

14:28.035 --> 14:31.571
But we aren't going to put on a
great show if you can't--

14:31.604 --> 14:34.241
Her hands aren't gonna get
tired any time soon.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.044
"Everything is
riding on this, Jodi!

14:37.077 --> 14:40.613
Cancelling is
not an option!"

14:40.647 --> 14:43.216
"So, what are we
supposed to do, Sun Hi--"

14:43.250 --> 14:45.618
Why am I
translating for you?

14:45.652 --> 14:46.819
Yell at her yourself!

14:50.290 --> 14:52.825
Woo, wee, wayyy.

14:55.996 --> 14:56.596
The face.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.098
You still got it.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.034
Aunt Em!

15:01.334 --> 15:03.036
Aunt Em!

15:03.070 --> 15:03.971
You're kidding me.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.973
Mr. Stark,
I am a real actor,

15:06.006 --> 15:08.008
I can play any part,
even Dorothy.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.210
I commend you on your
commitment, Mr. Anderson.

15:10.243 --> 15:14.181
But you wouldn't last
through Act One in those heels.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.216
Wait, Mr. Stark,
let's talk about this!

15:16.249 --> 15:18.118
Oh, my ankles!

15:18.151 --> 15:18.785
Ow!

15:21.688 --> 15:22.222
Okay.

15:22.255 --> 15:22.956
Three people are here.

15:22.990 --> 15:23.823
Two want to skate.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.226
The other one is
from the Sun Hi Nation.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.261
She wants to know
if it's her mom.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.729
No, it's her
old babysitter.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.731
She's at least thirty,
and wearing a shirt

15:31.764 --> 15:33.733
with a bunch of
cats on the front.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.667
How's your voice?

15:34.701 --> 15:35.268
Anything?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.140
We've got to cancel.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.211
"No way, we can't,
we promised--

15:44.244 --> 15:45.245
What's that?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.247
we'd perform."

15:47.280 --> 15:50.183
But that cat sweatshirt, it
might affect my performance.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.053
Just saying.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.955
"You two have to go
out there, put on a show

15:55.989 --> 15:57.724
that my old babysitter
will never forget."

15:57.757 --> 15:58.858
Sun Hi's right.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.361
We owe it to ourselves to put on
a great show regardless

16:01.394 --> 16:03.163
of how many people
are out there.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.397
Or on the stage.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.400
You guys pick the worst
times to be sensible.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.241
Valerie, what are
you doing here?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.408
What about the game?

16:15.442 --> 16:16.476
Beagle down.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.878
Turns out our star quarterback
twisted his ankle,

16:18.911 --> 16:20.013
so we had to forfeit.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.714
Jared twisted his ankle?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.051
Yeah, and he won't tell anyone
how it happened either.

16:24.084 --> 16:28.988
Also, his legs were shaved they
were smoother than mine.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.190
Whatever.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.025
So, you want a ticket?

16:32.059 --> 16:32.992
Sure.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.262
Could be fun to watch
you fail in person.

16:35.295 --> 16:39.066
By the way, everyone who was at
the game is waiting to get in.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.703
Oh yeah, okay, yeah.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.783
I was okay when
nobody was coming.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.451
But the place is full.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.986
I've never sung
lead before.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.088
Me neither.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.224
What's she saying?

17:04.257 --> 17:07.194
"You two will be great, just
do what we've been doing."

17:07.227 --> 17:08.761
"And I love you."

17:08.795 --> 17:10.330
Did she really
say that last part?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.699
It would've been nice,
wouldn't it?

17:14.401 --> 17:15.502
Bandmates forever.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.203
Wait.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.071
People are gonna
know it's me.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.839
Oh, right!

17:19.872 --> 17:22.041
But not with this!

17:22.075 --> 17:23.276
Thanks.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.815
I'm really sorry
guys but,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.351
I don't think
I can do it.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.756
Trust me.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.191
No one will
know it's you.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.992
I'm not going to
tell anyone.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.162
What's she saying?

17:42.195 --> 17:43.530
She won't
tell anyone either,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.432
since she only ever
gossips about herself.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.433
True.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.803
Let's do this before,
I change my mind.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.546
Welcome to the grand
opening of Club Ry Ri!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.382
(applause)

18:02.415 --> 18:05.985
Caleb: Let's go party people,
put your hands together

18:10.123 --> 18:11.124
Sun-Hi: Nooooooo!

18:11.158 --> 18:12.125
Not without me!

18:13.460 --> 18:15.862
* Let's light it up

18:15.895 --> 18:18.265
* Let's see it all
around us *

18:20.933 --> 18:23.069
* We're one and all

18:23.102 --> 18:25.972
* The fire's gonna guide us

18:28.241 --> 18:30.543
* Look at the sky

18:30.577 --> 18:36.015
* We gonna make it
shine so bright, oh *

18:36.048 --> 18:42.189
* Get ready now, it's time
to put your cellies high *

18:42.222 --> 18:46.859
* I wanna feel it (whoa)

18:46.893 --> 18:49.462
* Light it up,
Light it up *

18:49.496 --> 18:54.133
* 'Cause I wanna
see it (whoa) *

18:54.167 --> 18:57.103
* Light it up,
Light it up *

18:57.136 --> 18:58.938
* Light it up for love

18:58.971 --> 19:01.874
*

19:01.908 --> 19:04.211
* Light it up,
light it up *

19:04.244 --> 19:06.112
* Light it up for love

19:06.145 --> 19:09.115
*

19:09.148 --> 19:12.051
* Just, light it up,
light it up *

19:12.084 --> 19:22.094
*

19:22.128 --> 19:31.137
*

19:31.170 --> 19:34.441
* Now do you
feel the love *

19:34.474 --> 19:36.976
* Tonight it's all
around us *

19:39.612 --> 19:42.081
* We're here tonight

19:42.114 --> 19:44.251
* And no one's
gonna stop us *

19:47.119 --> 19:49.389
* Look at the sky

19:49.422 --> 19:54.561
* I've never seen
it shine so bright, oh *

19:54.594 --> 19:56.896
* You're ready now

19:56.929 --> 19:58.265
* 'Cause tonight
we're gonna, *

19:58.298 --> 20:01.368
* Get fired up,
let's light it up *

20:01.401 --> 20:05.338
* I wanna feel it (whoa)

20:05.372 --> 20:08.074
* Light it up,
Light it up *

20:08.107 --> 20:13.112
* 'Cause I wanna
see it (whoa) *

20:13.145 --> 20:15.515
* Light it up,
Light it up *

20:15.548 --> 20:17.417
* Light it up for love

20:17.450 --> 20:20.387
*

20:20.420 --> 20:22.955
* Light it up,
Light it up *

20:22.989 --> 20:28.060
* Light it up for love

20:28.094 --> 20:30.363
* Just, light it up,
light it up *

20:30.397 --> 20:33.232
* Light it up

20:33.266 --> 20:37.970
(cheering)

20:38.004 --> 20:38.505
Thank you!

20:38.538 --> 20:39.939
Thank you so much!

20:47.447 --> 20:48.681
Your voice
sounded great!

20:48.715 --> 20:52.118
I guess the fear of not being
able to sing with my own band

20:52.151 --> 20:53.320
snapped me out of it.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.387
And look.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.455
They love us!

20:56.022 --> 20:57.957
No one will ever
forget our debut!

20:57.990 --> 21:01.361
I'm so glad you were able to be
here to hog all the spotlight.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.496
Yeah, me, too.

21:07.199 --> 21:07.967
Uh-oh!

21:08.935 --> 21:11.638
I want everyone back
to school immediately!

21:12.639 --> 21:14.073
That means now!

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
Hey, who was
that Masked Girl?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.545
Does anybody know
who that was?

21:19.446 --> 21:21.548
Which one of you is
responsible for this?

21:23.182 --> 21:25.151
