Come on!

00:24.636 --> 00:25.937
Whoo!

00:26.005 --> 00:27.405
Ohh!

00:27.473 --> 00:28.740
Get it on!

00:28.930 --> 00:30.965
Whoo-hoo!

00:38.254 --> 00:39.607
I can't believe
you did that.

00:39.608 --> 00:41.809
I got us free shots,
didn't I?

00:41.877 --> 00:43.410
Michelle, everyone
was taking pictures.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.213
They better tag us,
then.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.814
That's the last thing I want.
What if Adam saw?

00:46.882 --> 00:49.450
He's at a bachelor party
in Vegas.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.557
If they only wake up
with a tiger in their bathroom,

00:51.619 --> 00:53.120
they've failed at life.

00:53.188 --> 00:56.323
What happened? I thought
the girls were right behind us.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.924
I think Amber Lee
had to close out.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.192
You want me
to go get them?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.927
Yeah, right.
I'll never see you again.

01:00.995 --> 01:03.196
You wait here.
I'll go get them.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.632
Fine. Have another drink
while you're at it.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.701
Next stop is the pole vault,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.338
and they have a strict
"no prudes" policy.

01:12.805 --> 01:15.274
And get us some wine.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.720
Hey there, cowboy.

Mm-mmm. Slow down, Stetson.

01:48.806 --> 01:51.008
My friends are probably
looking for me.

01:51.075 --> 01:53.710
I can't help it.
You're so beautiful.

02:06.089 --> 02:10.626
Uh...Houston, I think
we have a problem.

02:14.231 --> 02:16.531
Must've had
too much to drink.

02:16.598 --> 02:18.433
Of course you did.

02:19.668 --> 02:20.701
Hey.

02:20.769 --> 02:21.702
Get off of me.

02:21.770 --> 02:25.206
Hey. Come on, just
give me a damn second.

02:25.274 --> 02:26.942
Uh...No.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.944
No. It's not working.

02:29.011 --> 02:30.078
We're through.

02:31.013 --> 02:32.379
I'll say
when we're through.

02:32.447 --> 02:34.348
Aah!

02:38.153 --> 02:40.387
The theory of variation.

02:40.455 --> 02:44.024
Time to prove
who did the reading.

02:44.092 --> 02:45.559
Susan.

02:45.626 --> 02:48.261
It focuses on the universal
properties common to a given language.

02:48.329 --> 02:50.763
You're quoting the text.
Give me an example.

02:50.831 --> 02:52.098
French.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.101
Uh, spoken worldwide,
but the same phrase in Paris

02:55.169 --> 02:57.870
might have a completely
different inference in Montreal.

02:57.938 --> 03:00.073
That's right. This theory
looks at the cultural stages

03:00.140 --> 03:02.241
a particular language
undergoes

03:02.309 --> 03:04.909
in order to understand
its evolution.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.845
Who can tell me
the first stage?

03:06.912 --> 03:07.879
Anton.

03:07.947 --> 03:09.747
Pidgin.

03:09.815 --> 03:14.552
Pidgin is correct,
Mr. Slavsky.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.189
This is when non-native
speakers use phrases

03:17.256 --> 03:21.025
from the mainstream
language in a broken manner,

03:21.093 --> 03:22.926
often resulting
in an overly literal...

03:22.995 --> 03:26.030
translation of the meaning.

03:27.966 --> 03:31.369
I thought cell phones weren't
allowed in class, Dr. Blake.

03:33.105 --> 03:35.873
It would appear
that I'm a variation

03:35.940 --> 03:37.273
to my own rule.

03:37.341 --> 03:38.842
Jeffrey.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.148
Last night Michelle Bradley

03:45.216 --> 03:47.584
went missing from a friend's
bachelorette party

03:47.652 --> 03:49.219
in Austin, Texas.

03:49.286 --> 03:50.821
Austin P.D. say
that she is the third

03:50.889 --> 03:52.322
in a series of
abductions in a week.

03:52.390 --> 03:55.180
Right. The first victim, Craig
Pickett, he was a student at T.U.

03:55.182 --> 03:56.793
He disappeared from
a fraternity party.

03:56.794 --> 04:00.163
He was discovered at the visitor
parking lot just after sunrise.

04:00.230 --> 04:01.898
He had been beaten
with a blunt object.

04:01.965 --> 04:03.833
And then Heather Wilson,
she was a veterinarian

04:03.901 --> 04:05.601
living in the Old West
district.

04:05.669 --> 04:08.771
She disappeared from
a speed-dating function thing

04:08.839 --> 04:11.407
and she was found in a
nearby alley the next morning.

04:11.474 --> 04:13.142
She had been stripped
and she had been stabbed.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.508
Each of the victims was at
a social gathering the night

04:15.509 --> 04:16.555
that they were abducted.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.978
Witness reports say
that they were there

04:18.004 --> 04:19.048
one minute and gone the next.

04:19.048 --> 04:20.781
Ok, so this guy
doesn't waste any time.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.490
He knows who he wants
and how to get them.

04:22.552 --> 04:24.686
That shows organization
and sophistication.

04:24.754 --> 04:27.888
He had Craig and Heather for less
that 12 hours before he killed them.

04:27.956 --> 04:29.857
We may already be out
of time to save Michelle.

04:29.925 --> 04:32.193
No apparent link
in victimology.

04:32.261 --> 04:34.028
What troubles me
is the variation in M.O.

04:34.096 --> 04:36.697
The speed and efficiency of the
abduction suggests one unsub.

04:36.765 --> 04:38.566
So is he using
weapons of opportunity

04:38.633 --> 04:41.168
or specifically catering
his murder ritual to each victim?

04:41.235 --> 04:43.236
There's clear evidence
of overkill on both.

04:43.304 --> 04:45.074
Craig's face was caved in,

04:45.099 --> 04:47.674
and the damage to Heather's
genitals was extensive.

04:47.675 --> 04:50.710
He's angry,
but about what?

04:50.778 --> 04:52.946
Well, the motive on Heather
appears sexual.

04:53.013 --> 04:54.881
She was stripped down
to nothing more than a watch,

04:54.949 --> 04:56.783
while Craig was left
fully clothed.

04:56.850 --> 04:57.983
His wallet was missing.

04:58.051 --> 05:00.152
There might be some kind
of financial motivation.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.621
Or it's plain
old-fashioned jealousy.

05:02.689 --> 05:05.091
He kills Craig in a rage
and the beast is unleashed.

05:05.158 --> 05:07.159
That's when he starts
targeting women.

05:07.227 --> 05:08.760
His area of control
appears to be quite large.

05:08.828 --> 05:10.596
What's interesting is
he dumps the bodies

05:10.663 --> 05:12.465
in the same district
they're abducted from.

05:12.532 --> 05:15.200
So he doesn't go far,
yet he'd need privacy.

05:15.267 --> 05:18.002
Maybe he uses his vehicle
for the assaults.

05:18.070 --> 05:21.872
Which means
he could be anywhere.

Consider yourself
fortunate.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.410
She was stabbed?

06:52.477 --> 06:53.845
It's a lot of blood.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.673
It looks like Michelle
was still bleeding out

06:55.681 --> 06:57.180
when the unsub dumped her here.

06:57.248 --> 06:59.282
He was probably with her
the whole night.

06:59.350 --> 07:02.285
A large pickup truck or
an SUV would go unnoticed

07:02.353 --> 07:03.420
in these parts.

07:03.487 --> 07:04.988
Give him room to work.

07:05.056 --> 07:07.891
A bachelorette party
and a speed-dating function.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.726
Both female victims
were in situations

07:09.794 --> 07:11.227
that would have drawn
the attention

07:11.295 --> 07:12.328
of the men around them.

07:12.396 --> 07:14.364
So maybe the unsub
was on the prowl.

07:14.432 --> 07:16.366
The women could have
enraged him

07:16.434 --> 07:18.000
by rejecting his advances.

07:18.069 --> 07:19.869
Well, they didn't reject him
right away, though.

07:19.937 --> 07:22.505
He was able to lure both into isolation,
which tells me he's got game.

07:22.573 --> 07:23.673
Well, what about
Craig Pickett?

07:23.740 --> 07:25.442
He disappeared
from a frat party.

07:25.509 --> 07:26.870
Well, pickett
was the first victim.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.578
And the unsub's use of a blunt
object rather than a knife

07:29.645 --> 07:31.113
suggests that the kill
was impulsive.

07:31.181 --> 07:34.783
It's probable that Craig
and the unsub are connected.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.251
You should take a closer look

07:36.319 --> 07:39.654
at his classmates
and professors.

07:49.198 --> 07:51.332
Excuse me for a minute.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.234
What's up?

07:53.302 --> 07:55.136
Michelle Bradley's
crime scene photos

07:55.204 --> 07:57.572
just came in.
Take a look.

07:59.874 --> 08:02.142
He took off everything
but the watch,

08:02.210 --> 08:03.370
just like
with Heather Wilson.

08:03.411 --> 08:04.411
No clothes, no earrings,

08:04.479 --> 08:06.113
not so much
as a hair tie left.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.514
But he leaves a watch.

08:07.582 --> 08:09.249
It's a compulsion.

08:09.317 --> 08:11.684
It could be his signature.

08:12.653 --> 08:15.655
Shanice, do you happen
to remember

08:15.723 --> 08:19.358
if Michelle was wearing
this watch last night?

08:19.426 --> 08:21.260
I don't think so.

08:21.328 --> 08:22.461
I don't know.

08:22.529 --> 08:24.409
Do you happen to have
any pictures on your phone

08:24.431 --> 08:25.731
I could take a look at?

08:25.798 --> 08:28.800
Oh...yeah, we took a couple.

08:29.869 --> 08:31.069
Here you go.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.337
Thank you.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.177
I counted 40 stab wounds

08:39.245 --> 08:41.812
of various depths
of penetration.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.115
He's targeting her femininity.

08:44.183 --> 08:48.119
This type of anger stems from
a deep-seated hatred of women.

08:48.187 --> 08:49.053
Or <i>a</i> woman.

08:49.121 --> 08:50.420
So you think
they're surrogates

08:50.488 --> 08:52.623
for someone
who emasculated him?

08:52.690 --> 08:54.558
The time and effort it takes
to stab someone 40 times

08:54.626 --> 08:56.426
takes determination,
the sort indicative

08:56.494 --> 08:58.428
of someone affected
by a past trauma.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.597
Well, if his work here
is any indication,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.098
he's unraveling quickly.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.534
We should take a look at Craig.

09:03.601 --> 09:05.601
He triggered
the unsub's violence.

09:05.669 --> 09:09.372
He certainly put up
the biggest fight. Here.

09:12.543 --> 09:14.544
Let me show you.

09:19.483 --> 09:22.384
Craig was harder to control.

09:22.451 --> 09:25.720
How did he get the bruising
on his chest and back?

09:25.788 --> 09:28.490
He was fully clothed
when he was found.

09:28.558 --> 09:30.358
There's no tears in his shirt.

09:30.426 --> 09:32.661
He must not have been
wearing it when he was attacked.

09:32.728 --> 09:35.863
The unsub dressed him
postmortem.

09:35.931 --> 09:38.165
He's showing remorse.

09:38.233 --> 09:42.069
Craig was closer to his attacker
than we thought.

09:44.972 --> 09:47.874
How long have you and Craig
been roommates?

09:47.942 --> 09:50.010
Since freshman year.

09:50.078 --> 09:51.679
You two seem very close.

09:51.746 --> 09:54.146
He was like my brother.

09:54.215 --> 09:55.348
Well, that's rare.

09:55.416 --> 09:58.618
My freshman roommate
and I didn't get along.

09:58.686 --> 10:00.353
At all.

10:05.326 --> 10:07.694
You told police
you went to the game

10:07.761 --> 10:09.361
the night after Craig
disappeared?

10:09.429 --> 10:11.263
What happened after that?

10:11.331 --> 10:13.765
Uh, came back to the campus.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.500
Hit a couple
of frat parties.

10:15.568 --> 10:16.935
Which ones?

10:17.002 --> 10:19.104
Uh--uh--I don't
really remember.

10:19.171 --> 10:20.606
I was drunk.

10:29.781 --> 10:31.515
This must be tough,

10:31.583 --> 10:35.018
having to pack up
all his things on your own.

10:35.086 --> 10:36.721
Didn't his family
want to help?

10:36.788 --> 10:39.957
Well, we've been living
together a long time.

10:40.024 --> 10:43.293
I told them I'd sort through
what was his and what was mine.

10:43.361 --> 10:45.762
Yeah. That reminds me

10:45.829 --> 10:50.267
of another roommate
I had at the Academy.

10:50.334 --> 10:52.602
She used to
make me promise her

10:52.670 --> 10:54.504
that if something
ever happened to her,

10:54.572 --> 10:57.873
I'd get rid of anything
her parents shouldn't see.

11:01.978 --> 11:05.748
What didn't Craig
want his parents to see, Will?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.321
Was it this?

11:17.393 --> 11:20.728
You may want to put that
with the other things.

11:20.796 --> 11:24.666
Please, you can't tell them.

11:24.733 --> 11:27.935
I've scoured the victims'
social feeds, and I can confirm

11:28.003 --> 11:29.536
Michelle is the only one

11:29.604 --> 11:31.871
who turned up wearing a watch
that didn't belong to her.

11:31.939 --> 11:34.508
Well, she's also the only one
not wearing a watch when abducted.

11:34.575 --> 11:36.136
Time is somehow important
to this unsub.

11:36.177 --> 11:38.211
But not the right time.
None of the watches were accurate.

11:38.279 --> 11:39.245
That has to mean something.

11:39.314 --> 11:41.315
Well, it's a message,
but for whom?

11:41.382 --> 11:43.116
The watch he put on
Michelle was broken.

11:43.184 --> 11:45.251
Could that be his way
of saying her time was up?

11:45.320 --> 11:47.921
Maybe they were taunts,
telling us that we're out of time.

11:47.988 --> 11:49.989
Could it be like
time of death?

11:50.057 --> 11:52.625
You know, like only
the unsub understands it

11:52.693 --> 11:54.861
notification kind of thing?

11:54.929 --> 11:56.362
You know, Garcia might be right.

11:56.430 --> 11:57.563
It happens.

11:57.631 --> 11:59.132
Not about the notifications.
The times don't add up.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.634
But what if it's a warning?
What if he's setting the watches

12:01.702 --> 12:04.402
to the time
of the next abduction?

12:04.470 --> 12:07.539
6:22.

12:09.042 --> 12:10.742
I really hope
you're wrong, Spence.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.947
Listen, I will take a shot
if you'll ride the bull.

12:15.014 --> 12:17.149
I'll ride the bull.
I'll ride the bull. Let's go.

12:17.217 --> 12:18.883
3, 2, 1.

12:21.486 --> 12:24.155
Ohh!
Oh, come on. That was disgusting.

12:24.223 --> 12:25.389
What is that?

12:25.457 --> 12:26.690
Oh, come on, don't tell me

12:26.758 --> 12:28.525
you've reached
the shot stage already?

12:28.593 --> 12:29.760
You're late.
Where you been?

12:29.828 --> 12:32.529
And you brought a stray.
Who's your friend, Mitch?

12:32.597 --> 12:35.165
This is Doug. He just transferred
in from the Boston office,

12:35.233 --> 12:38.401
and he is in desperate need
of friends and beverages.

12:38.469 --> 12:40.003
And not necessarily
in that order.

12:40.071 --> 12:41.972
Ah, you came to
the right place. Sit down.

12:42.039 --> 12:42.973
Have a drink.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.908
Yeah, you come sit
by me, Doug.

12:44.976 --> 12:46.542
Ohh. After you.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.111
You're stuck with me, I guess.

12:48.179 --> 12:49.445
You're stuck with me, pal.

12:49.513 --> 12:51.380
How's it going?
I'm Paige.

12:51.447 --> 12:52.368
Doug. Nice to meet you.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.416
I'm Paul. Hi.

12:54.484 --> 12:55.351
You mind?

12:55.418 --> 12:58.287
Not if you share.
Then we're cool.

12:59.422 --> 13:01.723
Thank you.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.425
How was work?

13:03.493 --> 13:05.027
I need a drink.

13:05.095 --> 13:06.394
Oh. Here. Have at it.

13:06.461 --> 13:08.196
Thank you so much.

13:08.264 --> 13:09.931
So...

13:09.999 --> 13:12.000
What kind of trouble
are we getting into tonight?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.701
Oh, you like trouble.

13:13.769 --> 13:16.304
Who doesn't?

13:19.308 --> 13:20.741
Michelle was a smoker.

13:20.809 --> 13:22.409
If the unsub saw her
on his own,

13:22.476 --> 13:25.478
he could have asked to bum
a cigarette or offered her a light.

13:25.546 --> 13:26.746
It's an easy in.

13:26.814 --> 13:28.415
Yeah. But according to
the M.E.'s report,

13:28.482 --> 13:29.917
neither Heather nor Craig
were smokers.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.104
They don't need to be.
This guy's socially proficient.

13:32.153 --> 13:34.788
He can adapt his ruse
to whomever he targets.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.224
Well, does that include
sexual orientation?

13:37.292 --> 13:39.258
Craig Pickett
was at a gay bar

13:39.326 --> 13:40.726
the night
he went missing.

13:40.794 --> 13:42.434
Well, that fits
with the other abductions.

13:42.495 --> 13:43.963
But why would
the roommate lie?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.764
Craig hadn't come out
to his parents.

13:45.832 --> 13:48.200
Will was trying to protect
his friend's secret.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.636
Or intentionally
obstructing the investigation.

13:50.703 --> 13:52.071
No, I don't think so.

13:52.139 --> 13:54.872
Because of the physical
brutality he suffered,

13:54.941 --> 13:57.142
will assumed Craig
was the victim of a hate crime

13:57.209 --> 13:59.510
and didn't want his death
becoming a media spectacle.

13:59.578 --> 14:01.279
So we're back
to square one.

14:01.347 --> 14:02.580
Not necessarily.

14:02.648 --> 14:05.350
Craig was the only victim
that the unsub felt remorse for.

14:05.418 --> 14:08.353
Their connection could
have been an intimate one.

14:17.128 --> 14:19.396
You know, I gotta say...

14:19.464 --> 14:23.000
that was one hell of
a welcome to Austin.

14:27.972 --> 14:30.806
I guess we got
a little carried away.

14:37.647 --> 14:39.082
Need some help?

14:39.149 --> 14:40.916
Got it.

14:40.985 --> 14:42.417
Ok.

14:42.485 --> 14:46.254
You all right?

14:46.322 --> 14:48.523
Paul?

14:48.591 --> 14:49.691
What's wrong?

14:49.758 --> 14:52.627
We shouldn't have
done that.

14:52.695 --> 14:53.761
I thought
you were into it.

14:53.829 --> 14:55.597
I wasn't.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.900
I was. Just I...

15:01.503 --> 15:04.038
You should go.

15:04.106 --> 15:06.974
No, not until
you talk to me.

15:07.042 --> 15:10.111
Here. Have a seat.

15:17.118 --> 15:20.420
What is going through
your head right now?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.691
Guys are not sup--

15:25.759 --> 15:28.628
guys are supposed
to be with girls.

15:30.130 --> 15:36.735
Oh, man. Someone really did
a number on you, didn't they?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.737
Parent or pastor?

15:43.209 --> 15:47.412
How do you do this?
I mean, how are you ok with this?

15:48.580 --> 15:53.017
I wasn't. Not for
a real long time.

15:55.654 --> 15:59.257
But there comes a point
when you just gotta ask yourself

15:59.324 --> 16:00.858
how much longer are you
willing to pretend

16:00.926 --> 16:02.492
to be someone
that you aren't.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.728
Who says I'm pretending?
Who says I'm...

16:05.796 --> 16:09.099
Hey. This room, for one.

16:10.935 --> 16:14.037
Yeah.

16:14.105 --> 16:17.074
Yeah, it is a mess.

16:17.141 --> 16:19.408
Yeah, it's...

16:19.476 --> 16:22.545
I don't know
what I'm doing.

16:25.548 --> 16:28.516
Then I guess it's a good thing
you met me, then.

16:34.190 --> 16:35.990
I'm a great teacher.

16:37.793 --> 16:40.628
Relax, baby.

16:40.696 --> 16:42.696
I'm a great teacher.

16:47.034 --> 16:49.970
Get out.
Just--don't touch me.

16:50.037 --> 16:51.171
Paul, what the hell?

16:51.239 --> 16:53.140
Don't...

17:02.044 --> 17:03.424
There's been another victim?

17:03.425 --> 17:04.692
Doug Warn.

17:04.759 --> 17:06.226
An accountant from Boston.

17:06.294 --> 17:08.095
Hotch and Rossi
are still at the crime scene.

17:08.162 --> 17:09.463
Body was dumped
near a park.

17:09.530 --> 17:12.232
Was he wearing a watch?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.867
6:59. Was the watch
still working?

17:15.935 --> 17:17.369
If you mean by working,
still ticking, yeah,

17:17.438 --> 17:19.205
but it was at least
2 1/2 hours off, though.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.707
Now that we have a few
working watches, though,

17:20.773 --> 17:22.054
we might be able
to see a pattern

17:22.108 --> 17:24.609
in how or why the unsub
changes the times.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.678
Let's see.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.948
6...

17:30.016 --> 17:32.351
What time was the body
discovered?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.220
I don't know.
An hour ago, maybe. Why?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.821
You know the exact time?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.888
A jogger called it in...

17:37.956 --> 17:40.592
at...9:04.
He was running laps,

17:40.659 --> 17:43.340
so the body couldn't have been
laying there more than a few minutes.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.738
I...

17:54.805 --> 17:57.274
Think I know
what the messages say.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.642
Well, Reid,
spit it out already.

17:58.709 --> 18:00.210
6:22.

18:00.278 --> 18:02.513
Ok, are you talking about
Michelle's watch or Doug's watch?

18:02.580 --> 18:03.947
I'm talking about
all the watches.

18:04.015 --> 18:05.516
If you take the times
the bodies were discovered,

18:05.583 --> 18:07.384
subtract the variance
the corresponding watches are off by,

18:07.452 --> 18:10.019
you land within plus or minus
6 minutes of 6:22

18:10.086 --> 18:11.854
every single time.
Which, taking into consideration

18:11.921 --> 18:14.323
the time between dump
and discovery and all the public areas

18:14.391 --> 18:16.825
and the fact that
the only broken watch we found

18:16.893 --> 18:17.926
was already
stuck at 6:22,

18:17.994 --> 18:19.195
it's reasonable
to deduce

18:19.263 --> 18:21.183
the unsub sets the watches
to the exact same time

18:21.198 --> 18:23.466
just before disposing
of the bodies.

18:23.534 --> 18:25.134
So stupid. It was literally staring me
in the face the whole time.

18:25.201 --> 18:26.401
I don't know
how I missed it.

18:26.469 --> 18:28.203
Come on, Reid, stop.
You're the only person

18:28.271 --> 18:30.505
who can realize all of this.
So what does 6:22 mean?

18:30.573 --> 18:31.806
Reid...
I have no idea.

18:31.874 --> 18:34.075
All I know is what it says.
I don't know what it means.

18:39.282 --> 18:41.549
Well, he used
a blunt object again.

18:41.616 --> 18:44.051
This kill was just
as impulsive as the first.

18:44.118 --> 18:46.554
Were there any defensive
wounds under his clothes?

18:46.621 --> 18:48.656
No, but you should
take a look.

18:54.028 --> 18:55.896
That's combining
murder rituals.

18:55.963 --> 18:58.298
Is he unraveling
or evolving his M.O.?

18:58.365 --> 18:59.632
It could be both.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.835
Did he inflict the stab wounds
pre- or postmortem?

19:02.903 --> 19:05.171
It was all postmortem
after the first blow.

19:05.239 --> 19:07.006
Back of his head.
Killed him instantly.

19:08.141 --> 19:09.542
Next was the face?

19:09.610 --> 19:11.444
Actually, no.
Based on the blood loss,

19:11.512 --> 19:13.012
I'd say the stabbing
was first.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.647
That doesn't add up.
Why would he switch to a knife,

19:15.715 --> 19:17.583
then go back to
the blunt object after?

19:17.650 --> 19:20.519
Well, he must be attacking
the face for a specific reason.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.521
It could be a manifestation
of his guilt,

19:22.589 --> 19:23.788
like the re-dressing.

19:23.856 --> 19:25.123
Or of his self-worth.

19:25.191 --> 19:26.752
Maybe he didn't want
the men to see him.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.893
His self-esteem would have
been at an all-time low.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.929
But he only reached
the low with the men,

19:31.996 --> 19:33.598
not the women.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.603
Dr. Aylesworth, did the victim
have sex before he died?

19:38.670 --> 19:41.038
I believe so.
I found traces of lubricant

19:41.106 --> 19:44.709
consistent with that used
on latex condoms.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.209
Thank you.

19:48.045 --> 19:50.547
We believe we're looking
for a white homosexual male

19:50.615 --> 19:52.048
in his mid- to late 20s

19:52.116 --> 19:53.916
who is suffering from
an identity crisis.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.119
This man can't accept
his same-sex desires,

19:56.186 --> 19:57.621
but he can't
fight them either.

19:57.688 --> 20:00.724
He's most likely been repressing
all sexual urges

20:00.791 --> 20:02.725
for quite some time.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.960
The first victim,
Craig Pickett,

20:05.027 --> 20:07.229
represents a fall from
the wagon, if you will.

20:07.297 --> 20:08.997
Intercourse between
the two men

20:09.065 --> 20:10.799
was most likely
the unsub's trigger.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.301
Immediately after copulation,

20:12.369 --> 20:14.737
the male's serotonin
levels drop.

20:14.804 --> 20:16.505
The high is achieved
during sex.

20:16.573 --> 20:19.073
That rapid change can manifest
itself in extreme depression

20:19.141 --> 20:20.508
and low self-esteem.

20:20.576 --> 20:22.009
Combined with
an apparent belief

20:22.077 --> 20:24.579
that acting on his attraction
towards other men is wrong,

20:24.647 --> 20:27.181
this state causes the unsub
to lash out violently

20:27.249 --> 20:28.750
at those he's with.

20:28.817 --> 20:30.184
As his levels
normalize,

20:30.252 --> 20:32.420
he begins to feel remorse
for what he's done

20:32.488 --> 20:35.255
and he tries to correct
his course.

20:35.323 --> 20:37.624
This is where Heather
and Michelle come in.

20:37.692 --> 20:39.926
After killing Craig,
the unsub sought out women

20:39.994 --> 20:41.728
that he was desperate
to be attracted to.

20:41.796 --> 20:44.831
But he's trapped in a scenario
with an impossible outcome.

20:44.899 --> 20:47.267
He can't force himself
to like women,

20:47.335 --> 20:49.102
so when he's unable
to get aroused,

20:49.170 --> 20:53.105
he becomes depressed again
and lashes out in anger

20:53.173 --> 20:55.341
to the people he blames
for his impotence.

20:55.409 --> 20:57.759
The circular logic dictating
his never-ending cycle

20:57.784 --> 20:58.844
was not formed overnight.

20:58.845 --> 21:01.447
It most likely came about
due to years of serious abuse,

21:01.515 --> 21:04.350
either emotional,
physical, or both.

21:05.118 --> 21:06.484
We're more than friends.

21:06.552 --> 21:08.720
What are you talking about?

21:08.788 --> 21:10.655
I like him.
Like like him.

21:10.723 --> 21:13.391
The hell you do.
Don't even think like that, son.

21:13.459 --> 21:14.759
It's how I feel.

21:14.827 --> 21:15.893
No, it isn't.

21:15.961 --> 21:17.128
It can't be.

21:17.196 --> 21:18.596
He's taken advantage
of you somehow.

21:18.597 --> 21:20.898
He hasn't.
It's the truth.

21:20.966 --> 21:22.966
Truth?

21:23.034 --> 21:23.934
The truth?

21:24.001 --> 21:26.403
I'll show you
the truth.

21:26.471 --> 21:29.262
The most popular motive
for trying to overcome

21:29.287 --> 21:30.708
same-sex attraction

21:30.709 --> 21:34.411
is the need to be accepted
by the parent or loved one

21:34.479 --> 21:36.246
who has rejected
the individual

21:36.314 --> 21:37.980
because of their
homosexuality.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.583
So focus on men who grew up
in a broken home

21:40.651 --> 21:43.085
and suffered under the guardianship
of a domineering parent,

21:43.153 --> 21:45.888
as well as those who fell victim
to bigotry or bullying.

21:50.861 --> 21:53.262
Tell her she's beautiful.

21:53.330 --> 21:54.963
I am, aren't I?

21:55.030 --> 21:56.898
You're an abomination!

21:56.966 --> 21:58.867
I'm a great teacher.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.168
You're doing it wrong.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.738
I'm gonna make you a real man.

22:02.805 --> 22:05.206
An abomination!

22:12.781 --> 22:15.549
The bottom line is
this unsub will not stop killing.

22:15.617 --> 22:18.219
With each failed attempt
to become aroused by women

22:18.287 --> 22:20.454
or to avoid giving in
to his same-sex urges,

22:20.522 --> 22:23.057
he becomes more desperate
and more dangerous.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.092
Thank you.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.163
Oh, thank God you're ok.

22:31.188 --> 22:32.799
You haven't been answering
your phone all day

22:32.800 --> 22:34.733
and I thought something
had happened to you, too.

22:34.801 --> 22:37.136
What are you talking about?

22:37.204 --> 22:40.172
Doug was murdered
last night.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.407
What?

22:41.474 --> 22:43.209
Yeah, it must have happened
after you dropped him off.

22:43.277 --> 22:45.744
He didn't show up to work
and so I--

22:45.812 --> 22:49.214
I went by his apartment and
there were cops everywhere.

22:49.282 --> 22:51.582
What'd you tell them?

22:51.650 --> 22:54.485
Nothing. I came straight here
to make sure you were ok.

22:54.553 --> 22:56.587
I'm fine.

22:56.655 --> 22:58.790
Fine, I promise.

23:05.096 --> 23:09.099
Getting the 4-1-1
on a 6-2-2 is not easy.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.801
I am looking up that date,

23:10.868 --> 23:13.837
and June 22 is quite
eventful in recent history.

23:13.905 --> 23:15.605
It sounds like miss thing's
got something good.

23:15.673 --> 23:17.474
Well, uh, let's see.

23:17.542 --> 23:18.997
On this date in 1990,

23:19.022 --> 23:21.203
Florida banned the wearing
of thong bikinis.

23:21.478 --> 23:23.012
I said good, baby girl.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.613
Right, right. Ok.

23:24.681 --> 23:27.116
Let's see.
June 22, 1992,

23:27.184 --> 23:30.119
Supreme Court ruled
Minnesota hate crime laws

23:30.187 --> 23:31.554
violated free speech.

23:31.621 --> 23:34.390
The defendant burned a cross

23:34.458 --> 23:38.060
on the front yard of an
African-American family's house

23:38.127 --> 23:39.561
who lived next door.

23:39.628 --> 23:42.664
Nothing in the unsub's profile
suggests racial motivation, though.

23:42.731 --> 23:44.632
No, but the cross
has me thinking.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.721
Many religions suggest
that following through

23:46.821 --> 23:50.045
on homosexual desires
invites condemnation.

23:50.206 --> 23:53.574
What if the unsub
is struggling with his faith?

23:53.641 --> 23:58.745
Garcia, are there any 6:22 Bible
passages that are relevant?

23:58.813 --> 23:59.729
Yeah, I thought of that,

23:59.754 --> 24:01.915
but the most popular one
is Matthew 6:22

24:01.916 --> 24:04.718
and it has to do with lights and eyes.
I don't see how that fits.

24:04.786 --> 24:06.454
All right, well, let's
look at this another way.

24:06.521 --> 24:09.089
What are the passages that
specifically relate to homosexuality?

24:09.156 --> 24:13.826
That's it. He's not saying
6:22. He's saying 18:22.

24:13.894 --> 24:15.161
As in Leviticus 18:22.

24:15.229 --> 24:17.464
"Thou shalt not lie with mankind
as with womankind,

24:17.531 --> 24:18.965
for it is an abomination."

24:19.033 --> 24:23.036
He converted 18:22
to 6:22 p.m.

24:23.104 --> 24:25.204
Like military time.

24:25.271 --> 24:26.805
Maybe the unsub suffered abuse
at the hands of someone

24:26.873 --> 24:28.240
citing God's will
that he should change.

24:28.308 --> 24:30.209
It wouldn't be the first time
someone took the good book

24:30.276 --> 24:31.676
and twisted it
for their own agenda.

24:31.711 --> 24:34.513
Ok, but if you wanted to change
someone's sexual orientation,

24:34.580 --> 24:35.381
how could you do it?

24:35.389 --> 24:36.915
I mean, you're not gonna
guilt somebody into that.

24:36.916 --> 24:40.252
Uh, I'm seeing some stuff
about an ex-gay movement.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.521
It looks like some kind
of a 12-step program.

24:43.588 --> 24:44.989
A 12-step program

24:45.057 --> 24:47.892
usually doesn't
traumatize the participant.

24:47.959 --> 24:49.419
But conversion therapy might.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.329
Several conversion camps
have been shut down recently

24:51.330 --> 24:52.897
'cause their methods
border on torture.

24:52.964 --> 24:55.404
Yeah, but why would any faith
condone the torture of children?

24:55.467 --> 24:57.667
None of them would. Even a religion
that frowns on homosexuality.

24:57.735 --> 24:59.336
None of them
would cross that line.

24:59.404 --> 25:02.372
Garcia, are there conversion
camps in the area?

25:02.440 --> 25:03.940
Uh...

25:04.008 --> 25:05.708
I got a hit.
Camp Willing

25:05.776 --> 25:07.110
operates just outside
of Austin.

25:07.178 --> 25:08.678
Their motto is,
"It's time to change."

25:08.746 --> 25:11.714
And guess which biblical
passage is on their home page.

25:22.692 --> 25:24.126
Mitch.

25:38.775 --> 25:40.241
What are you doing
in here?

25:40.309 --> 25:41.710
I had to use the bathroom.

25:41.778 --> 25:43.845
Is this Doug's blood?

25:46.915 --> 25:48.649
It's not my fault.

25:48.717 --> 25:51.719
Not your fault.
Whose fault was it, Paul?

25:51.787 --> 25:53.153
Theirs.

25:53.221 --> 25:54.488
Yeah.
Theirs?

25:54.556 --> 25:55.890
How could it be their fault?

25:55.958 --> 25:57.592
They haven't laid a hand
on you in years.

25:57.659 --> 25:59.426
You know what
they did to me?

25:59.494 --> 26:02.829
Of course I do. They did
the same thing to me, too.

26:05.567 --> 26:08.435
There we go.
No forgetting what time it is now.

26:08.503 --> 26:12.406
Best hurry off. You don't want to be
late for class, do you?

26:20.847 --> 26:24.016
I can't let you leave yet,
Mitch.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.488
We have to work
some things out first.

26:38.712 --> 26:42.015
Our main purpose
is to promote positive changes

26:42.082 --> 26:46.718
for the conflicted
individuals who come here.

26:46.786 --> 26:50.422
There doesn't seem to be
much room for self-expression.

26:50.490 --> 26:52.991
We try to keep things
as uniform as possible.

26:53.059 --> 26:54.860
We're not trying
to stifle them.

26:54.927 --> 26:57.663
It's just that progressive behavior
in many ways

26:57.730 --> 27:00.331
can unravel their
recovery efforts.

27:00.399 --> 27:01.832
Such as colors?

27:01.900 --> 27:05.570
Earth tones like brown or tan
are the go-to.

27:05.638 --> 27:08.640
Navy blue if the color
doesn't fade or become too bright.

27:08.707 --> 27:11.309
Because bright blue
would be considered too feminine?

27:11.377 --> 27:12.343
Exactly.

27:12.411 --> 27:15.546
And the auto shop
aids in conversion how?

27:15.613 --> 27:17.947
We've found that
immersing the boys

27:18.015 --> 27:20.116
in traditional
male gender roles

27:20.185 --> 27:22.852
stimulates an appreciation
of their own masculinity.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.655
I know it seems extreme,

27:24.722 --> 27:26.323
but you have to remember,

27:26.391 --> 27:29.359
our participants are in
a fragile state of mind.

27:29.427 --> 27:31.960
They come here confused,
looking for answers.

27:32.028 --> 27:33.729
We show them that
the path to redemption

27:33.797 --> 27:35.764
doesn't need
to be walked alone.

27:35.832 --> 27:39.902
You sound like you
speak from experience.

27:39.969 --> 27:42.471
I'm a graduate.
The camp taught me

27:42.539 --> 27:44.106
to reject societal
influences

27:44.174 --> 27:46.275
that were steering me
in the wrong direction.

27:46.343 --> 27:50.011
And now I try to pass
that knowledge on.

27:50.079 --> 27:51.413
Come.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.149
When a new participant
arrives,

27:55.218 --> 27:57.151
we have to evaluate
their personal property

27:57.220 --> 27:58.653
before it can be
returned to them.

27:58.721 --> 28:01.656
Items like musical soundtracks
or diaries are destroyed.

28:01.724 --> 28:05.326
Long hair is cut,
dyed hair shaved, no earrings.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.027
That sort of thing.

28:07.095 --> 28:08.629
The watch is standard issue?

28:08.697 --> 28:10.264
Cell phones
aren't permitted.

28:10.332 --> 28:11.792
The watches are so that
no one will be late

28:11.817 --> 28:13.138
to any of their lessons.

28:14.135 --> 28:16.870
Structure and timeliness
become an important part

28:16.938 --> 28:18.772
of promoting change.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.673
And what if someone
breaks the rules?

28:20.741 --> 28:21.941
It's uncommon.

28:22.008 --> 28:23.610
Uncommon
but not unheard of.

28:23.677 --> 28:25.612
Oh, occasionally
a student will act out

28:25.679 --> 28:27.947
or reject certain elements
of the program.

28:28.014 --> 28:29.616
What happens
to those who act out?

28:29.683 --> 28:33.286
Advanced therapy under
supervision of a senior counselor.

28:33.354 --> 28:35.121
Could you be more specific?

28:35.188 --> 28:37.389
I'm afraid I can't.
Parents and staff

28:37.457 --> 28:39.023
sign confidentiality
agreements

28:39.091 --> 28:42.193
to protect the parents'
right to privacy.

28:42.262 --> 28:46.030
And what about
the children's rights?

28:47.467 --> 28:50.235
Was there anything else
I can help you with, agents?

28:50.303 --> 28:52.069
Yes. We'd like a list
of program participants

28:52.137 --> 28:54.071
dating back
the past 15 years.

28:54.139 --> 28:55.139
All we want are names.

28:55.206 --> 28:56.240
That's quite impossible.

28:56.308 --> 28:58.041
Those records
are confidential.

28:58.109 --> 29:00.311
Well, let's make them
unconfidential.

29:00.379 --> 29:03.213
Or we'll be back here
with a court order.

29:03.282 --> 29:04.857
Whoa, that's
a lot of names.

29:04.858 --> 29:07.192
Cross the list with
know associates of each victim

29:07.217 --> 29:08.318
and see if you get a hit.

29:08.319 --> 29:10.879
And, Garcia, flag the participants
who didn't finish the program.

29:10.888 --> 29:12.548
They're most likely the ones
who had to endure this

29:12.573 --> 29:14.123
so-called advanced therapy.

29:14.124 --> 29:15.425
With Xs and Os I go.

29:15.493 --> 29:17.427
Thank you.

29:17.495 --> 29:19.362
You should have seen it.

29:19.430 --> 29:22.098
All sense of individuality
was stripped away.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.465
And these kids were young.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.267
You're sure it was
the same watch?

29:25.335 --> 29:27.403
The unsub went to that camp.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.805
The watch he put
on Michelle's wrist

29:29.872 --> 29:31.773
was the exact same model
that all the kids were wearing.

29:31.841 --> 29:34.375
What do you think was behind
that padlocked door?

29:34.443 --> 29:35.710
Well, it could be anything.

29:35.778 --> 29:37.279
I mean, come on, we've
all read the stories.

29:37.346 --> 29:39.447
A conversion camp
was just shut down last year

29:39.515 --> 29:42.284
for using electric shock
therapy on children.

29:42.351 --> 29:44.752
Another stripped the kids naked
and screamed profanities at them.

29:44.821 --> 29:46.987
We need to go back
with a warrant.

29:47.055 --> 29:48.488
We're gonna need
probable cause.

29:48.556 --> 29:49.990
Well, let's find some.

29:50.058 --> 29:53.828
Because there is more going on
at that camp than they let on.

29:55.197 --> 29:56.964
You gotta
turn yourself in, Paul.

29:57.032 --> 29:59.433
I can't turn myself in.
They're gonna put me away.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.701
What, are you gonna
kill me, too?

30:00.768 --> 30:03.303
No.

30:03.370 --> 30:04.871
Are you gonna turn me in?

30:04.939 --> 30:05.872
No.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.140
No, Paul.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.809
Y-you just need some help.

30:09.877 --> 30:11.644
I've already had help.
You remember that?

30:11.712 --> 30:14.113
No, I mean like real help,
professional help.

30:14.181 --> 30:16.049
It worked for me.

30:17.051 --> 30:18.317
Did it?

30:18.384 --> 30:23.021
Yeah. Me and Josh are
coming up on like 6 months now.

30:23.089 --> 30:26.225
Yeah.

30:30.063 --> 30:33.565
It might throw a wrench
in your happy union...

30:33.632 --> 30:37.068
You hanging out with
a serial murderer and all.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.872
Oh, my God.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.207
Those women.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.609
The ones who were stabbed.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.879
That was you,
wasn't it, Paul?

30:48.747 --> 30:51.547
They reminded me of her.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.351
What you got, mama?

30:54.418 --> 30:57.520
A man named Mitchell Ruiz
went to Camp Willing in 2003.

30:57.588 --> 31:00.257
He works at the same office
as our dearly departed Doug Warn.

31:00.324 --> 31:01.992
What's the catch?

31:02.059 --> 31:03.693
Well, Mitchell's office
just reported him missing.

31:03.761 --> 31:05.495
He went to go look for Doug,
he never returned.

31:05.562 --> 31:07.462
So Mitchell either is our unsub
or he fell victim to him.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.048
I did a little research
to see if he was one of the

31:09.073 --> 31:10.465
good kids or the bad kids.

31:10.466 --> 31:13.306
It turns out that Mitchell's parents,
3 weeks into that conversion camp,

31:13.370 --> 31:17.373
they started making private
payments to a dummy corp

31:17.440 --> 31:20.075
that was shut down
two years ago for prostitution,

31:20.143 --> 31:23.044
as in one prostitute,
Isabella Grant.

31:24.613 --> 31:26.414
And from the amount of money
they were paying her,

31:26.481 --> 31:28.658
you have to wonder what
morals she wasn't willing

31:28.683 --> 31:30.765
to chew up and swallow.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.961
Miss Grant, my name's
Aaron Hotchner.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.163
I'm with the FBI.

31:43.231 --> 31:47.034
I'd like to talk to you
about Camp Willing.

31:47.101 --> 31:48.568
What are you offering?

31:48.636 --> 31:49.970
You don't seem surprised.

31:50.038 --> 31:51.972
It was a matter of time.

31:52.040 --> 31:57.076
And you've already got me
in here for everything else.

31:57.144 --> 31:59.511
So what are you gonna
give me if I talk?

31:59.579 --> 32:01.713
I don't make deals
with child molesters.

32:01.781 --> 32:03.182
I didn't molest anyone.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.384
I was hired
to help those kids.

32:05.452 --> 32:08.587
Being paid to prey on your victims
doesn't change anything.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.822
I had parental consent.

32:10.889 --> 32:13.425
Is that what the camp told you
to make you feel better?

32:13.492 --> 32:14.759
They didn't have to.

32:14.827 --> 32:16.394
Why? Because you didn't care?

32:16.462 --> 32:19.564
Or because you'd spoken
to the parents directly?

32:21.334 --> 32:24.469
You show absolutely no remorse
for what you've done.

32:24.536 --> 32:26.770
Why should you?

32:26.838 --> 32:29.106
The smaller the victim,
the easier to control.

32:29.174 --> 32:32.042
And that's what it's all
about for you, isn't it? Control.

32:32.110 --> 32:34.744
It's why you're showing me
all this false confidence.

32:34.812 --> 32:36.480
I'm done talking.

32:36.547 --> 32:37.914
You've said plenty.

32:37.983 --> 32:40.184
A professional like yourself

32:40.251 --> 32:42.918
wouldn't trust the camp
to protect you.

32:42.987 --> 32:44.991
You had to get some sort
of insurance directly

32:45.016 --> 32:46.550
from the parents, didn't you?

32:47.624 --> 32:50.493
Make sure that they were
just as culpable for the crime.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.561
Your word against theirs
wouldn't hold up in court,

32:52.629 --> 32:55.564
not with a child testifying
to your abuse.

32:55.632 --> 32:58.833
Unless, of course, the abuse
damned the parents as well.

33:01.304 --> 33:05.007
They were in the room
with you, weren't they?

33:07.010 --> 33:09.344
You made them watch.

33:12.348 --> 33:15.216
Where are you going?
What about my deal?

33:15.283 --> 33:17.551
We never had a deal.

33:19.621 --> 33:21.555
Why didn't it work?

33:21.623 --> 33:23.124
Why didn't what work?

33:23.191 --> 33:25.259
With the girls.
Why couldn't I just--

33:25.327 --> 33:27.128
why couldn't I
just do it?

33:27.195 --> 33:29.163
You killed them.
What more did you want to do?

33:29.231 --> 33:30.697
Not that.

33:30.765 --> 33:33.000
It.

33:33.067 --> 33:35.301
I could always
get it up for her.

33:35.369 --> 33:36.783
Well, then we were teenagers.

33:36.808 --> 33:39.046
We could practically get it up
for tomato soup.

33:48.715 --> 33:50.983
You ever wonder why
we broke up?

33:51.051 --> 33:52.418
You ever wonder that?

33:52.485 --> 33:54.820
I'm pretty sure
that year of hell

33:54.888 --> 33:56.422
had something to do with it.

33:56.489 --> 33:58.991
Yeah, a year.

33:59.059 --> 34:01.894
You were lucky.

34:01.962 --> 34:05.430
I screwed up, Mitch. I--

34:05.497 --> 34:08.667
I thought that maybe
those girls could fix me.

34:08.734 --> 34:10.735
Paul, listen to me.

34:10.803 --> 34:14.505
You don't need fixing.

34:15.841 --> 34:19.242
You just need
a little bit of help.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.746
Now, please, man,
just give me the gun.

34:22.813 --> 34:25.783
You know that
this isn't the way.

34:26.685 --> 34:29.453
Relax. You got it.

34:31.289 --> 34:34.123
You're so beautiful.

34:34.192 --> 34:35.157
Mmm.

34:35.225 --> 34:36.926
Oh!

34:36.994 --> 34:38.962
Damn it, Paul.

34:39.029 --> 34:40.362
That's not the way.

34:40.429 --> 34:41.797
Come here.

34:41.864 --> 34:45.501
Let me show you.

34:49.039 --> 34:50.772
You know what?
You're right?

34:52.141 --> 34:55.777
I'm not the one
that needs fixing.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.647
Garcia, I need you to track
who was at the conversion camp

34:58.715 --> 35:00.816
the same time
as Mitchell Ruiz,

35:00.883 --> 35:03.384
and then narrow that to those
whose parents made payments

35:03.452 --> 35:05.921
to Isabella Grant's
dummy corporation.

35:05.989 --> 35:09.156
Uh...Only one name matches.
Paul Westin.

35:09.224 --> 35:10.424
He went to the same school
as Mitchell,

35:10.492 --> 35:12.053
and his mom was killed
in action in Iraq

35:12.094 --> 35:13.427
when he was only a 'tween.

35:13.495 --> 35:15.096
All right, find out everything
you can about Paul

35:15.163 --> 35:16.931
and then send the address
to JJ and Blake.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.666
Yep. Sending it now.

35:28.175 --> 35:29.275
Clear.

35:29.343 --> 35:30.644
Clear.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.846
Clear. JJ?

35:45.525 --> 35:47.259
Paul?

35:47.326 --> 35:49.461
Get in the house
right now.

35:49.529 --> 35:50.696
What's going on?
Are you in trouble, son?

35:50.764 --> 35:51.697
Don't you call me that!

35:51.765 --> 35:53.065
You don't get
to call me that!

35:53.133 --> 35:54.266
Not after what
you did to me.

35:54.333 --> 35:56.500
Paul, please.
What did I do?

35:56.568 --> 35:59.603
What did you do?
The camp? You remember, huh?

35:59.672 --> 36:01.005
You remember that?

36:01.073 --> 36:02.239
Get your ass downstairs!

36:02.307 --> 36:04.341
Let's talk
about this, son.

36:04.409 --> 36:06.377
There's nothing
to talk about!

36:08.313 --> 36:09.847
Paul!

36:10.915 --> 36:13.817
What the hell?
You gonna kill your dad?

36:13.885 --> 36:16.853
I was trying to save you.

36:16.921 --> 36:18.755
Save me? Ha.

36:18.823 --> 36:20.791
You mean fix me, don't you?

36:20.858 --> 36:22.317
Fix me.

36:22.768 --> 36:25.285
All those years trying to
prove to me that I was broken.

36:25.963 --> 36:28.064
Well, it worked, Dad.

36:28.131 --> 36:31.100
It worked.
I'm pretty damn broken now.

36:31.168 --> 36:32.702
That's not what I wanted.

36:32.769 --> 36:34.503
What you wanted.

36:35.739 --> 36:37.472
Take his clothes off.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.208
What?

36:39.275 --> 36:40.776
Take his clothes off.
What for?

36:40.844 --> 36:42.678
Well, they all thought
that they could rape us straight.

36:42.745 --> 36:45.980
I think it's time we see if it works
the other way around.

36:57.385 --> 36:59.319
We have to assume
Mitchell is with him.

36:59.387 --> 37:01.067
The keys and wallet
are in the living room.

37:01.122 --> 37:02.556
Could he be working
with Paul?

37:02.624 --> 37:04.357
Everything points
to Paul working alone,

37:04.425 --> 37:06.692
but that doesn't mean that Mitchell
isn't sympathetic to the cause.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.160
He experienced
the same trauma.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.763
I think I know why.

37:13.734 --> 37:15.935
They were in
a relationship.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.436
They were abused
for loving one another.

37:17.504 --> 37:19.271
Where would they go?

37:19.339 --> 37:21.206
With Mitchell helping him,
they'd be focused on revenge.

37:21.274 --> 37:23.508
Isabella's in prison, so he
wouldn't have a lot of options.

37:23.576 --> 37:24.494
You two head to the camp

37:24.519 --> 37:26.360
and I'll send the others
to the father's house.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.215
Get to it already.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.283
I can't.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.453
I want to go home, Paul,
please.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.756
He's the one that got us
into that camp.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.791
Convinced your parents
to let that woman do this to us.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.292
Do you want to make him pay?

37:42.360 --> 37:43.827
Of course I do,
but not like this.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.963
Mitchell, I'd do it
if I could.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.065
But I can't.
It's gotta be you.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.701
And then what?
It's not gonna solve anything.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.169
I'm not looking
for solutions.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.470
I'm just looking
to cope. Right, Dad?

37:53.538 --> 37:55.672
This isn't coping.

37:55.739 --> 37:56.739
This is crazy.

37:56.807 --> 37:59.642
You're starting to sound
like one of them.

37:59.710 --> 38:03.680
Only one of us
is suggesting rape.

38:12.622 --> 38:14.456
It's Paul's truck.

38:14.523 --> 38:17.292
Paul?

38:17.359 --> 38:18.660
Ohh!

38:27.368 --> 38:29.303
Mitch? Mitch.

38:29.370 --> 38:30.638
Son!

38:35.310 --> 38:37.712
Hey, you're ok. Come here.

38:37.779 --> 38:39.680
Come here.
Now you're all right.

38:39.748 --> 38:40.815
Mitch.

38:40.882 --> 38:43.717
Don't you--don't you die on me.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.553
Don't do it!

38:47.622 --> 38:50.056
Don't do it, Paul.

38:50.124 --> 38:51.524
There's nothing left
for me here.

38:51.592 --> 38:53.627
Look at his wrist.
Track marks.

38:53.694 --> 38:57.697
What happened to you
in that camp, Paul?

38:57.765 --> 38:59.464
It doesn't matter anymore.

38:59.532 --> 39:01.299
Yes, it does.

39:01.367 --> 39:03.602
You kill yourself,
they get away with it.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.705
If you testify, we can shut
them down for good.

39:06.773 --> 39:10.109
What good?
I'm an abomination.

39:10.176 --> 39:12.811
No, you're not.

39:12.879 --> 39:14.679
If you want to live
your life

39:14.747 --> 39:17.015
according to a single
message, go ahead.

39:17.082 --> 39:19.817
But try John 13:34 instead.

39:19.885 --> 39:22.419
"A new command I give you.

39:22.487 --> 39:25.256
"Love one another.

39:25.323 --> 39:27.258
"As I have loved you,

39:27.325 --> 39:30.394
you must love one another."

39:30.462 --> 39:31.982
The best way
for you to do that

39:32.030 --> 39:34.097
is to put that gun down.

39:34.165 --> 39:36.366
Paul, you are a victim.

39:36.433 --> 39:39.903
And there are others being victimized
right now that you can help.

39:39.971 --> 39:42.839
Wouldn't Mitchell want you to do
everything possible to make sure

39:42.907 --> 39:45.275
that nobody else suffered
your same fate?

39:45.342 --> 39:46.676
Come on.

39:46.743 --> 39:48.811
Put it down.

Pidgin

is correct, Mr. Slavsky.

42:03.038 --> 42:04.071
Pidgin.

42:04.139 --> 42:06.607
This is when
non-native speakers

42:06.675 --> 42:09.610
use phrases from
the mainstream language

42:09.678 --> 42:11.111
in a broken manner,

42:11.179 --> 42:15.448
usually resulting
in a overly literal translation.
