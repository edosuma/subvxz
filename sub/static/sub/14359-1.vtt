WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:04.880
Okay, here's the thing

00:03.086 --> 00:04.880
about my family:

00:04.922 --> 00:06.966
we don't go on a lot of outings

00:04.922 --> 00:06.966
together, but when we do,

00:07.007 --> 00:09.134
there's a little tradition

00:07.007 --> 00:09.134
we always end up observing.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.552
When you say lifetime ban,

00:10.594 --> 00:12.137
I mean, whose lifetime

00:10.594 --> 00:12.137
are you talking about?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.889
REESE:

00:12.179 --> 00:13.889
Ow! Mom, let my feet

00:13.931 --> 00:15.140
touch the ground.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.934
Don't you ever ask me

00:15.182 --> 00:16.934
for anything ever again.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.727
I should've just

00:16.976 --> 00:18.727
given birth to chimps.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.104
Then at least I know

00:18.769 --> 00:21.104
to expect this kind of behavior.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.272
Ow!

00:22.314 --> 00:24.065
Believe it or not,

00:22.314 --> 00:24.065
I actually envy Dewey.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.694
He got to stay home and play

00:24.107 --> 00:26.694
with the babysitter.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.571
And then the ambulance came,

00:26.735 --> 00:29.571
but there was this balloon.

00:29.613 --> 00:30.948
And then I was chasing it,

00:30.990 --> 00:32.449
and then I didn't know

00:30.990 --> 00:32.449
where I was.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.075
And then I chased a bag,

00:34.117 --> 00:35.995
and then I really didn't know

00:34.117 --> 00:35.995
where I was.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.120
And then I saw you,

00:37.162 --> 00:39.080
and I thought

00:37.162 --> 00:39.080
maybe you could help me

00:39.122 --> 00:41.917
because you helped that other

00:39.122 --> 00:41.917
girl-- the one in the movie.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.461
So if you could just

00:41.959 --> 00:44.461
come to life and help me,

00:44.503 --> 00:46.505
I'd really appreciate it.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.927
DEWEY:

00:49.758 --> 00:51.927
Thanks anyway.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.242
Huh!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.954
Good lord, Hal,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.954
he could have a gun.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.622
Just let him pass.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.125
All right, silver Toyota,

02:01.663 --> 02:05.125
you win this round.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.089
Go ahead, get there

02:06.919 --> 02:10.089
two seconds sooner!

02:10.130 --> 02:13.008
That guy is just an accident

02:10.130 --> 02:13.008

How can something so

02:58.095 --> 03:01.723
simple be so delicious?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.433
That stuff's nasty, Francis.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.602
To the unsophisticated

03:03.475 --> 03:05.602
palate, yes,

03:05.644 --> 03:09.064
but to me, the Candy Quack

03:05.644 --> 03:09.064
is nature's perfect food.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.692
I'll bet I could eat

03:09.106 --> 03:11.692
a hundred of them.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.862
No way. All that marshmallow

03:11.733 --> 03:14.862
would expand in your stomach.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.237
You wouldn't get past 50.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.239
Okay, there's where

03:16.279 --> 03:18.239
you're wrong, Joe.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.241
See, the marshmallow

03:18.281 --> 03:20.241
wouldn't expand.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.242
It would dissolve.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.870
I'd never get full.

03:22.911 --> 03:23.871
In fact, I don't...

03:23.912 --> 03:26.081
Will you just shut up!

03:26.123 --> 03:27.624
I have sat back

03:27.666 --> 03:31.128
and said nothing

03:27.666 --> 03:31.128
while you've gone on and on

03:31.170 --> 03:33.964
about how you can eat

03:31.170 --> 03:33.964
a hundred of this

03:34.006 --> 03:36.257
and lift a hundred of that.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.053
The Quacks would expand.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.096
You're an idiot

03:39.094 --> 03:41.096
if you think different.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.891
Okay, let me tell

03:41.138 --> 03:43.891
you something.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.061
If I say I can eat

03:43.932 --> 03:47.061
a hundred Quacks,

03:47.102 --> 03:49.646
you can take that as

03:47.102 --> 03:49.646
a bona fide guarantee.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.357
And there's no need to resort

03:49.688 --> 03:52.357
to personal attacks,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.151
because I'd hate to raise

03:54.193 --> 03:58.238
the whole issue of you

03:54.193 --> 03:58.238
wearing boxers in the shower.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.083
That was so cool.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.168
Did you see that truck

04:09.124 --> 04:11.168
jackknife and flip over

04:11.210 --> 04:12.544
and that wheel fly

04:11.210 --> 04:12.544
through the air?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.295
An explosion

04:12.586 --> 04:14.295
would've been nice,

04:14.337 --> 04:15.923
but you can't

04:14.337 --> 04:15.923
have everything.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.298
Yeah, Reese,

04:15.964 --> 04:17.298
this is great.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.300
Now we're stuck

04:17.340 --> 04:19.300
here for hours

04:19.342 --> 04:21.302
with no food and no

04:19.342 --> 04:21.302
air-conditioning.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.013
I guess it could be worse.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.640
I could be the guy

04:23.055 --> 04:25.640
in the silver Toyota.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.394
Why can't you just

04:27.559 --> 04:29.394
open one lane?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.563
Lady, we have to wait

04:29.436 --> 04:31.563
for the crane to get here

04:31.605 --> 04:34.315
before we can even think of

04:31.605 --> 04:34.315
opening this road to traffic.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.235
Yeah, but if you just moved a

04:34.357 --> 04:36.235
couple of those police cars,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.819
there'd be enough room to

04:36.276 --> 04:37.819
just pass on the shoulder.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.613
I mean, this is

04:37.861 --> 04:39.613
just plain stupid.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.323
Ma'am, don't call

04:39.654 --> 04:42.323
a police officer stupid.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.325
What, that's a law now?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.744
Look, my freshman year,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.996
I ate seven pounds of grapes

04:45.786 --> 04:47.996
in one sitting.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.582
I think I know what my body

04:48.038 --> 04:50.582
is capable of.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.168
We're not talking

04:50.624 --> 04:53.168
about grapes, Francis.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.336
We're talking

04:53.210 --> 04:55.336
about pure sucrose.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.588
The human body simply

04:56.630 --> 04:59.549
cannot absorb the sugar

04:56.630 --> 04:59.549
in 100 Quacks.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.634
CADETS:

04:59.591 --> 05:00.634
Yeah!

05:00.675 --> 05:02.219
Hey, in extreme cases,

05:02.261 --> 05:04.846
the human pancreas has

05:02.261 --> 05:04.846
been known to increase

05:04.888 --> 05:06.265
its insulin production

05:04.888 --> 05:06.265
by up to 60%.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.724
CADETS:

05:06.306 --> 05:07.724
Yeah!

05:07.766 --> 05:09.434
Listen, your pancreas can

05:07.766 --> 05:09.434
produce enough insulin

05:09.476 --> 05:10.769
to fill a swimming pool.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.353
That doesn't mean squat

05:12.395 --> 05:14.231
if your adrenal gland

05:12.395 --> 05:14.231
can't distribute it

05:14.273 --> 05:15.816
into your bloodstream

05:14.273 --> 05:15.816
fast enough!

05:15.857 --> 05:17.151
CADETS:

05:15.857 --> 05:17.151
Yeah!

05:17.192 --> 05:18.944
(cadets arguing)

05:18.986 --> 05:20.279
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
This argument is pointless.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.293
One.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.422
Look, look at that--

05:37.420 --> 05:39.422
they're just standing around.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.424
Yeah, 500 cars full of people

05:39.464 --> 05:41.424
who actually have

05:41.466 --> 05:43.468
someplace to go, and they're

05:41.466 --> 05:43.468
just standing there talking.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.845
What is there to discuss?!

05:44.886 --> 05:47.388
Hey! Let me clear

05:44.886 --> 05:47.388
something up for you!

05:47.430 --> 05:48.807
This is a car wreck!

05:48.849 --> 05:52.393
You're a road crew.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.393
Do your job!

05:52.435 --> 05:55.438
Are you even listening

05:52.435 --> 05:55.438
to me?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.274
That could

05:55.480 --> 05:57.274
have been me.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.400
Yeah, well, Hal,

05:57.316 --> 05:59.400
it could've been all of us.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.320
Nope! No, that

05:59.442 --> 06:01.320
car was sliced

06:01.360 --> 06:03.113
right through

06:01.360 --> 06:03.113
the driver's seat.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.491
You and the boys would've

06:03.155 --> 06:06.491
walked away without a scratch.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.493
This totally sucks.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.411
It's like an oven out here.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.414
What is the point of wandering

06:10.453 --> 06:13.414
aimlessly through traffic?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.667
So we can find cool stuff

06:13.456 --> 06:15.667
like this.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.710
(chuckles)

06:16.751 --> 06:18.253
Smells like gasoline.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.047
Reese, can't we just

06:18.295 --> 06:20.047
go back to the car?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.089
My feet are killing...

06:21.131 --> 06:22.423
Ice cream man!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.425
(kids clamoring)

06:24.467 --> 06:26.427
Go away!

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
There is no ice cream

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
in the truck!

06:29.472 --> 06:30.682
He's lying!

06:30.724 --> 06:33.143
There's tons of ice cream

06:30.724 --> 06:33.143
in there!

06:33.185 --> 06:36.479
The ice cream in the truck

06:33.185 --> 06:36.479
is not for sale!

06:36.521 --> 06:38.439
It is against the law

06:38.481 --> 06:41.526
for me to sell ice cream

06:38.481 --> 06:41.526
in the middle of traffic!

06:41.568 --> 06:43.237
This is just wrong!

06:43.278 --> 06:45.446
You could make money

06:43.278 --> 06:45.446
and please children.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.907
This is a senseless act.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.450
You are evil--

06:46.948 --> 06:49.450
pure evil!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
Well, if you kids

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
are not willing

06:51.494 --> 06:53.372
to discuss this sensibly...

06:56.875 --> 06:58.252
You son of a...!

06:58.293 --> 06:59.753
Look, there's nothing

06:58.293 --> 06:59.753
you can do.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.837
Yes, there is.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.297
I can... I can...

07:02.339 --> 07:03.715
(yelling)

07:05.508 --> 07:06.634
(groaning)

07:06.676 --> 07:09.470
And the Nobel

07:06.676 --> 07:09.470
Prize goes to...

07:09.512 --> 07:12.515
Hey, you're talking

07:09.512 --> 07:12.515
about my brother.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.059
Good one.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.769
I'm Jessica-- gray Volvo.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.478
Malcolm-- crappy minivan.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.480
Do you want to go check

07:17.520 --> 07:19.480
out the crash site?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.359
Sure. You know, my dad

07:19.522 --> 07:22.359
practically caused it.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.568
Wow.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.487
What time is it now?

07:26.529 --> 07:27.572
It's still 4:00.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.157
You have to wait

07:27.614 --> 07:29.157
at least a minute

07:29.199 --> 07:30.533
for the time

07:29.199 --> 07:30.533
to change, dear.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.202
What time is it in China?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.495
Well, sweetie,

07:34.537 --> 07:35.997
I think they're

07:34.537 --> 07:35.997
a good 20 hour...

07:36.039 --> 07:37.582
Do you speak Chinese?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.334
Well, no. I...

07:39.376 --> 07:40.501
Is Chinatown in China?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.296
Honey, if you want

07:42.337 --> 07:44.923
an answer to a question,

07:42.337 --> 07:44.923
you have to first wait...

07:44.965 --> 07:46.507
What does this toe do?

07:46.549 --> 07:49.552
You know what? I need to

07:46.549 --> 07:49.552
buy a pack of cigarettes--

07:49.594 --> 07:52.931
for the first time

07:49.594 --> 07:52.931
in 20 years.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.772
DEWEY:

07:58.937 --> 08:00.772
Grape juice, please.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.359
(glass shatters)

08:04.401 --> 08:06.486
(people screaming)

08:09.030 --> 08:11.408
WOMAN:

08:09.030 --> 08:11.408
He's getting away!

08:16.621 --> 08:18.832
(tires screeching)

08:23.670 --> 08:25.255
(whoops)

08:29.759 --> 08:31.594
Hello.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.397
Think about it, Lois.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.400
I stopped to tie my shoe

08:42.439 --> 08:45.400
in the parking lot.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.734
If I hadn't done that,

08:46.776 --> 08:49.237
we would've been

08:46.776 --> 08:49.237
on the road 20 seconds sooner.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.990
I would've been 200 yards

08:49.279 --> 08:51.990
ahead of where I was,

08:52.032 --> 08:54.575
and then I would've

08:52.032 --> 08:54.575
been the silver Toyota.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.577
And if you hadn't

08:54.617 --> 08:56.577
rented  Body Heat,

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
we never would

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
have had Dewey.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.080
It's all an intricate

08:57.829 --> 08:59.080
tapestry, Hal.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.581
OPERATOR:

08:59.122 --> 09:00.581
Ma'am?

09:00.623 --> 09:03.502
Yes. Hello... D-Did you

09:00.623 --> 09:03.502
ask your supervisor?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.003
Yes, and this phone is for

09:05.045 --> 09:06.963
emergency roadside assistance

09:05.045 --> 09:06.963
only, ma'am.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.798
I can't connect you

09:07.005 --> 09:08.798
to a private line.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.592
Look, I have got to get

09:08.840 --> 09:11.592
through to my babysit...

09:11.634 --> 09:14.388
Look. J-Just let me talk

09:11.634 --> 09:14.388
to the supervisor.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.680
One moment, ma'am.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.766
(deep voice):

09:15.722 --> 09:18.766
Hello. This is the supervisor.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.185
No, it isn't.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.020
You're just disguising

09:20.227 --> 09:22.020
your voice.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.647
No, I'm not.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.647
I'm really the supervisor.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.274
You can't do this!

09:26.316 --> 09:28.318
Ma'am, I'm about to be replaced

09:26.316 --> 09:28.318
by a machine.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.695
I can do whatever

09:28.360 --> 09:30.695
I damn well please.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.781
H-Hey! Where do you think

09:30.737 --> 09:33.781
you're going, young lady?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.326
It's okay. My dad's an

09:33.823 --> 09:36.326
investigator for the D.O.T.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.453
Oh, there he is.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.453
Hi, Daddy!

09:41.664 --> 09:43.458
Okay.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.628
Whoa. Your dad's

09:44.667 --> 09:47.628
a crash investigator?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.464
Here's a little

09:47.670 --> 09:49.464
secret, Malcolm:

09:49.506 --> 09:52.426
whenever you want something,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.426
everybody's your dad.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.676
Hi, Daddy!

09:57.722 --> 10:02.810
Okay, she's cute, she's smart,

09:57.722 --> 10:02.810
and she even lies to cops.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.230
I may be in over my head here.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.525
CADETS:

10:05.272 --> 10:08.525
Forty-six!

10:08.567 --> 10:11.361
Forty-seven!

10:11.403 --> 10:12.946
Forty-eight!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.638
(ice cream truck music playing)

10:44.436 --> 10:46.687
And when you're constantly

10:44.436 --> 10:46.687
moving from town to town,

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
it's really hard

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
to make friends.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.900
So, yeah, I acted

10:48.773 --> 10:50.900
out, I guess.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.777
But who wouldn't

10:50.942 --> 10:52.777
in my situation?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.405
(siren wailing)

10:55.447 --> 10:57.574
All right,

10:55.447 --> 10:57.574
I got to let you off here.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.658
Okay.

11:23.391 --> 11:27.312
Sixty-one!

11:27.354 --> 11:30.731
Sixty-two!

11:30.773 --> 11:33.901
Sixty-three!

11:33.943 --> 11:36.737
Sixty-two!

11:36.779 --> 11:39.740
Sixty-one!

11:39.782 --> 11:41.409
Sixty-two!

11:41.451 --> 11:43.744
Sixty-three!

11:43.786 --> 11:46.665
Malcolm, you have got

11:43.786 --> 11:46.665
to check out this view.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.749
Ow! I hate

11:46.705 --> 11:48.749
pricker bushes.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.002
What fruit are they

11:48.791 --> 11:51.002
trying to protect anyway?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.630
Do you see anything on

11:51.044 --> 11:53.630
here worth protecting?

11:53.672 --> 11:55.173
What are we

11:53.672 --> 11:55.173
doing up here?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.633
Just enjoying the sights.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.761
(grunting)

12:00.803 --> 12:02.472
And check out

12:00.803 --> 12:02.472
that crazy lady.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.975
(shouting)

12:06.017 --> 12:08.769
So tell me about

12:06.017 --> 12:08.769
this gifted class.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.812
It's horrible.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.189
I'm surrounded

12:09.854 --> 12:11.189
by Krelboynes.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.566
I have to do twice

12:11.231 --> 12:12.566
as much homework

12:12.607 --> 12:14.025
as anyone else

12:12.607 --> 12:14.025
in my grade.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.776
I have to take all these

12:14.067 --> 12:15.776
college-prep classes...

12:15.818 --> 12:16.777
What a nightmare.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.154
If you're not careful,

12:18.196 --> 12:19.947
you might get a full

12:18.196 --> 12:19.947
scholarship to Harvard.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.658
You don't understand.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.243
Malcolm, you've been

12:21.700 --> 12:23.243
bellyaching nonstop

12:23.284 --> 12:24.869
for an hour and a half.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.997
Seriously,

12:25.870 --> 12:27.997
all you do is bitch.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.457
I happen to bitch

12:28.039 --> 12:29.457
the perfect amount

12:29.499 --> 12:30.709
for someone

12:29.499 --> 12:30.709
in my situation.

12:30.749 --> 12:31.792
Today is the

12:30.749 --> 12:31.792
perfect example.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.253
Look at this mess.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.088
What's good about this?

12:35.129 --> 12:39.967
Well... if it weren't

12:35.129 --> 12:39.967
for this...

12:40.009 --> 12:41.760
we never would have met.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.018
(grunting)

12:50.853 --> 12:53.022
How could I not see that coming?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.441
This girl's incredible!

12:54.482 --> 12:55.483
(screams)

12:55.525 --> 12:57.068
Ow!

12:57.902 --> 12:59.446
Ow!

12:59.487 --> 13:00.821
Pricker bush.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.243
And I keep rolling it

13:02.741 --> 13:05.243
around in my head--

13:05.285 --> 13:07.036
how much time do I have left?

13:07.078 --> 13:08.871
And what have I done

13:07.078 --> 13:08.871
with my life?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.831
I mean, what is

13:08.913 --> 13:10.831
my contribution?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.626
You go home

13:10.873 --> 13:12.626
at night knowing

13:12.667 --> 13:15.420
that you have helped to make

13:12.667 --> 13:15.420
the world a better place

13:15.462 --> 13:17.422
by forging that thin blue line,

13:17.464 --> 13:18.923
and that is real, man.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.925
If I could just once

13:20.967 --> 13:23.844
feel that sense

13:20.967 --> 13:23.844
of accomplishment, it...

13:23.886 --> 13:26.556
Do you know

13:23.886 --> 13:26.556
how special you are?

13:26.598 --> 13:27.766
Do you?

13:31.269 --> 13:36.524
Z... Y... X...

13:38.735 --> 13:40.320
W...

13:45.700 --> 13:47.702
Okay, let me get this straight.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.702
We have been waiting

13:47.744 --> 13:51.790
all afternoon for a crane,

13:47.744 --> 13:51.790
and now the crane is here.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.124
That's right.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.794
And the man who works

13:53.166 --> 13:55.794
the crane, he's here, too.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.546
That's right.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.134
Then why is nothing happening?!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.885
Look, we can't touch anything

14:04.927 --> 14:07.054
until the investigators sign

14:04.927 --> 14:07.054
off on the accident report.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.599
Yeah, but they must have been

14:07.096 --> 14:09.599
done hours ago. Where are they?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.476
That's a whole

14:09.641 --> 14:11.476
nother department.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.645
It's really not

14:11.518 --> 14:13.645
my job to know.

14:15.980 --> 14:21.486
Start... the...  crane.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.238
You can't tell me what to do.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.576
(metal creaking)

14:30.036 --> 14:30.995
(grunting)

14:31.037 --> 14:32.205
Hey, not so fast,

14:31.037 --> 14:32.205
Charlie!

14:32.246 --> 14:33.581
Ah! Let go of me!

14:33.623 --> 14:35.625
What do you think

14:33.623 --> 14:35.625
you're doing, huh?

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
Nothing! I'm just

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
going for a walk!

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
What the hell's going on?!

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
This kid was trying

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
to break into your truck.

14:39.962 --> 14:40.921
Let go of me!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.215
I just want

14:40.963 --> 14:42.215
some damn ice cream.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.008
You don't deserve ice cream.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.344
Yeah, well, you don't deserve

14:44.050 --> 14:46.344
to be an ice cream man!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.721
Ow!

14:47.762 --> 14:50.181
Come here, you punk!

14:47.762 --> 14:50.181
You little punk!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.392
That will teach you

14:50.223 --> 14:52.392
to mess with me!

14:52.433 --> 14:54.561
I was a surgeon in my country!

14:58.231 --> 14:59.691
(gasps)

15:13.913 --> 15:15.956
MAN:

15:13.913 --> 15:15.956
Way to go!

15:15.998 --> 15:17.124
(excited chatter)

15:17.166 --> 15:18.042
Hit me again.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.712
Come on! Come on!

15:27.468 --> 15:28.969
Ha!

15:29.011 --> 15:32.682
Looks like the human body

15:29.011 --> 15:32.682
can only accept 96 Quacks.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.851
Check and mate.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.854
Francis, just four more.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.146
You can do it.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.815
Can't...

15:40.857 --> 15:42.901
Quacks...

15:42.942 --> 15:44.569
Dying...

15:44.611 --> 15:47.655
Hey, no one said he had

15:44.611 --> 15:47.655
to eat all the Quacks.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.409
They just have to be

15:47.697 --> 15:51.409
inside his body, right?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.494
(cadets murmuring)

16:01.335 --> 16:03.003
(cadets cheering)

16:01.335 --> 16:03.003
He did it!

16:03.045 --> 16:05.256
100 Quacks!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.428
You got heart.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
Hey, way to go,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
Francis.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.890
Man, that was way cooler

16:12.054 --> 16:13.890
than the time

16:13.932 --> 16:15.433
Davis did a thousand sit-ups.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.810
Impossible.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.645
I mean, Davis is

16:16.851 --> 16:18.645
in pretty good shape,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.020
but a thousand sit-ups?

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
You're just begging

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
for a double hernia.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.191
Man, it's that kind

16:22.440 --> 16:24.191
of small-minded thinking

16:24.233 --> 16:26.319
that keeps you from

16:24.233 --> 16:26.319
recognizing true greatness.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.320
(cadets arguing)

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
What are you

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
talking about?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.030
You're always arguing

16:29.071 --> 16:30.030
about something, man.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.366
A thousand sit-ups?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.366
Are you crazy?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.539
(burps softly)

16:39.874 --> 16:42.752
Pleasure doing business

16:39.874 --> 16:42.752
with you, Kyle.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.044
Nice moves

16:42.794 --> 16:44.044
out there, Erin.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.006
And here's your share,

16:44.086 --> 16:47.006
Mr. Wells.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.051
That man left us no choice.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.513
(laughter)

16:56.265 --> 16:58.058
Try the green one!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.561
(laughter)

17:02.104 --> 17:03.564
Come on out

17:02.104 --> 17:03.564
of there, ma'am.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.274
You order them

17:03.606 --> 17:05.274
to move this thing!

17:05.316 --> 17:07.151
Let's just get you

17:05.316 --> 17:07.151
out of the crane,

17:07.193 --> 17:09.278
and then we'll have

17:07.193 --> 17:09.278
a little talk.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.739
Don't you dare patronize me.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.240
Okay, you don't want

17:11.781 --> 17:13.240
to be patronized?

17:13.282 --> 17:15.451
I'll be blunt.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.451
You're a control freak.

17:15.493 --> 17:16.786
I see them all the time.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.079
But guess what?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.079
This is a traffic jam.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.248
It is out of your control.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.248
Yeah, but I...

17:21.290 --> 17:22.667
You can't boss it around.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.252
You can't yell at it

17:22.709 --> 17:25.252
and expect it to listen.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.253
I have been...

17:26.295 --> 17:28.381
It will end when it ends!

17:28.422 --> 17:30.090
You just have

17:28.422 --> 17:30.090
to live with it.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.052
There's absolutely nothing

17:30.132 --> 17:33.052
you can do about it.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.518
(laughter)

17:51.571 --> 17:54.114
Whose damn dog is this?!

17:54.156 --> 17:58.118
I said, whose damn dog is this?!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.203
He's trapped inside.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.121
All the windows are rolled up.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.875
It's... it's, like,

18:01.163 --> 18:03.875
90 degrees out here!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.127
Okay, okay...

18:07.169 --> 18:09.213
it is nobody's damn dog.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.800
Then I guess nobody's

18:09.255 --> 18:12.800
going to mind if I just do this!

18:17.972 --> 18:20.975
Oh... don't be scared,

18:17.972 --> 18:20.975
little doggy.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.351
Oh, no.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.062
Everything's going to be o...

18:24.103 --> 18:25.354
(growling)

18:25.396 --> 18:26.647
(gasps)

18:28.357 --> 18:30.026
(sighs)

18:36.991 --> 18:40.119
Oh, poor thing.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.163
Okay, I got it.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
I was hoping

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
I could deliver a baby

18:45.416 --> 18:50.046
in a taxicab or something,

18:45.416 --> 18:50.046
but... a life is a life.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.631
Oh, now look at you.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.174
Huh? How did you get like this?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.385
There you go, pal.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.431
(dog snarling, barking)

19:09.649 --> 19:11.233
I'm impressed.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.193
You actually have

19:11.275 --> 19:13.193
a working first-aid kit.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.655
We used to, but my brother

19:13.235 --> 19:15.655
ate all the Band-Aids.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.781
I think you'll live.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.074
You know, I

19:16.823 --> 19:18.074
was thinking,

19:18.116 --> 19:19.617
maybe sometime

19:18.116 --> 19:19.617
we can do something.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.077
It'd be cool if...

19:22.328 --> 19:24.413
You're from Canada?!

19:24.455 --> 19:27.166
We're here on vacation.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.378
(dog snarling, barking)

19:31.420 --> 19:33.506
Why didn't you tell me?

19:33.547 --> 19:36.009
Because then you would have

19:33.547 --> 19:36.009
spent the whole day grousing.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.927
I knew this was

19:36.050 --> 19:37.927
too good to be true.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.220
I mean, why should I

19:37.969 --> 19:40.220
get to meet someone

19:40.262 --> 19:41.931
who's smart, funny,

19:40.262 --> 19:41.931
not a Krelboyne,

19:41.973 --> 19:43.474
not a member of my family?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.102
But we did meet, Malcolm,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.102
and it was awesome.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.228
You know, it's okay

19:46.144 --> 19:48.228
to enjoy something

19:48.270 --> 19:50.272
even if it's just

19:48.270 --> 19:50.272
for a little while.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.858
Come on, we had fun.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.233
No, we didn't.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.819
You just said we did.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.446
That was before I knew this

19:54.861 --> 19:57.446
was all a big waste of time.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.117
(people cheering)

20:01.159 --> 20:02.910
WOMAN: Doogie, come back

20:01.159 --> 20:02.910
to the car, honey.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.245
MAN: Bobby, get a

20:02.952 --> 20:05.245
move on, sport.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.332
LOIS:

20:05.287 --> 20:08.332
Malcolm! Reese! Move!

20:08.374 --> 20:10.501
I got to go.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.463
Just pull out, Hal.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.341
I am waiting my turn.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.260
JESSICA:

20:17.383 --> 20:20.260
Malcolm!

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
Malcolm! Here's my phone number!

20:22.180 --> 20:23.472
Call me!

20:52.334 --> 20:57.173
That... was so much fun!

20:57.215 --> 21:00.300
Who would have thought

20:57.215 --> 21:00.300
a traffic jam would be so cool?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.553
We should totally

21:00.342 --> 21:02.553
do this again.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.388
When are we going

21:02.595 --> 21:04.388
on another road trip?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.141
Oh, how about next week?

21:08.392 --> 21:10.603
See you, kid.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.313
(laughs)

21:13.355 --> 21:15.775
Bye, Santa!

21:23.783 --> 21:25.534
Hi, Mom.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.327
Dewey, where's

21:25.576 --> 21:27.327
the babysitter?

21:27.369 --> 21:28.370
She went away.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.330
You got rid

21:28.412 --> 21:30.330
of another babysitter?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
What is wrong

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
with you kids?

21:32.041 --> 21:34.627
Then I drove off with

21:32.041 --> 21:34.627
a potato chip man.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.212
Then I picked apples.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.422
Then we all went to jail.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.422
Then I played the...
