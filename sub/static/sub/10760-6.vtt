10:14.283 --> 10:15.992
Now we know
why he dropped the lawsuit.

10:16.203 --> 10:18.777
- Yes, he's in love.
- Or on the rebound.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.249
Well, either way,
it's good news for all of you.

10:21.419 --> 10:23.079
Let's order
another bottle of champagne.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.877
And by the way, dinner is on me.
Or rather, the firm.

10:26.051 --> 10:28.507
Oh, no, no,
l couldn't let you do that, Abby.

10:28.679 --> 10:30.388
l wanted to pay for dinner.

10:30.599 --> 10:32.889
Don't worry. You are.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.074

10:41.824 --> 10:43.947
NlLES: Oh, Frasier,
l was just coming up to see you.

10:44.118 --> 10:45.530
FRASlER:
Oh, hi, Niles.

10:45.704 --> 10:47.912
Say, you're looking
a little green around the gills.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.911
Oh, please, don't even mention gills.

10:50.127 --> 10:53.083
The Yale Club had its annual lunch
at Vashon lsland. All seafood.

10:53.257 --> 10:55.583
- Oh, didn't agree with you?
- Oh, no, the food was fine.

10:55.761 --> 10:58.882
lt was the 4-foot swells coming back
on the ferry that didn't agree with me.

10:59.058 --> 11:02.392
l'm afraid l was forced to return
my sea bass to the sea.

11:02.813 --> 11:04.557
Actually,
l had sort of a rough day myself.

11:04.732 --> 11:08.732
You know, l can't stop thinking
about the bill that Abby sent me.

11:08.947 --> 11:10.656
- Oh?
- Well, you know, after witnessing

11:10.825 --> 11:13.862
her rather slipshod
recordkeeping last night,

11:14.038 --> 11:16.446
l can't help feeling
that l'm getting ripped off.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.669
So l fired off
a strongly worded e-mail today

11:19.838 --> 11:22.081
insisting on a point-by-point
accounting of my bill.

11:22.258 --> 11:23.290
Oh, good idea.

11:23.510 --> 11:26.963
Nothing cements a relationship
like calling the girl a crook.

11:27.182 --> 11:31.347
Speaking of relationships, how about
Donny's decision to get engaged?

11:31.564 --> 11:34.138
My God, talk about
classic rebound behaviour.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.777
Classic.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.779
ls it just me
or is this elevator swaying?

11:37.948 --> 11:41.235
Probably not the wisest decision
Donny could have made at this point.

11:41.453 --> 11:44.491
You know, maybe somebody
should have a talk with him.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.535
Stop. Don't even think about it.

11:46.711 --> 11:50.793
Right now the only thing Donny needs
is to be left alone.

11:52.427 --> 11:54.801
- Oh, hi, Daph.
- Hello.

11:54.973 --> 11:58.260
- Where are you off to?
- l've got to see Donny.

11:59.313 --> 12:01.105
Why in the world
do you have to see Donny?

12:01.316 --> 12:04.021
l'm worried about him.
He's making such a rash decision.

12:04.571 --> 12:08.819
l just wanna make sure he's okay.
And it's not just about that.

12:09.035 --> 12:10.696
We never really had
a proper goodbye

12:10.871 --> 12:13.446
and l feel bad leaving things
the way we did.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.827
What you're looking for is--

12:19.926 --> 12:21.552
Closure.

12:21.763 --> 12:24.681
Yeah. l knew you'd understand.

12:24.851 --> 12:28.303
- Niles, are you feeling okay?
- Oh, yes, l'll be fine.

12:28.522 --> 12:31.228
Well, in that case, when l get back,
this will all be behind us.

12:31.401 --> 12:32.517
We can celebrate.

12:32.695 --> 12:35.269
l'll make us
a nice big English country dinner.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.823
Steak and kidney pudding.

12:38.412 --> 12:39.788
ROZ:
Hold the elevator. Hey, Daphne.

12:39.956 --> 12:42.448
- Niles, l need your opinion.
- Oh, really, l was just about--

12:42.627 --> 12:44.953
About some more classical music
to tape for Alice.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.836
- What?
- Yeah. Oh. l, uh--

12:48.009 --> 12:50.501
Frasier gave me this list,
but it has over 300 names on it.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.711
Who do you think is best?

12:51.890 --> 12:53.550
l would really rather not read
right now.

12:53.726 --> 12:57.096
Okay, well, off the top of your head.
Alice really loves up-tempo numbers.

12:57.273 --> 12:59.065
Last night we were listening
to ''Peer Gynt''

12:59.233 --> 13:01.524
and she started doing all these
little ballerina moves.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.399
You should have seen her,
she was so cute.

13:03.573 --> 13:07.241
She would sway back and forth
to the music

13:07.454 --> 13:09.413
and do these little spins, a jump.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.825
l was doing it with her,
but l started to get so dizzy.

13:12.003 --> 13:16.168
The room went around
and around and around.

13:16.968 --> 13:19.128
- Oh, never mind. l'll ask Frasier.
FRASlER: Hi, Roz.

13:19.305 --> 13:20.930
Where are you going?
What about the CDs?

13:21.099 --> 13:23.722
l'm sorry. Take what you like
and mark it on the sign-out sheet.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.729
Niles, thank God you're here.
Come with me.

13:25.898 --> 13:27.725
There was a message on the machine
from Abby.

13:27.901 --> 13:30.523
She said
she needed to see me right away.

13:31.156 --> 13:32.437
She must have gotten my e-mail.

13:32.617 --> 13:35.784
The message was so short that l can't
really tell what sort of mood she's in.

13:35.996 --> 13:38.915
l guess if she'd been really angry,
she would've left some indication.

13:39.126 --> 13:40.705
Well, then again,
being a savvy lawyer,

13:40.878 --> 13:42.623
she might not really wanna tip
her hand.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.092
Whatever happens, l feel confident
that l made the right decision.

13:46.262 --> 13:48.468
Oh, thanks, Niles,
you've been a support.

13:48.682 --> 13:49.713
- Hi, Dad.
MARTlN: Hey.

13:49.892 --> 13:51.470
Oh, Niles, great news.

13:51.644 --> 13:53.721
Tony the chilli guy
got his vendor licence back.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.141
Check it out.

14:05.081 --> 14:07.787
- Oh, you have the rings?
- Right here.

14:07.959 --> 14:08.992
- Okay.
- Are you nervous?

14:09.170 --> 14:10.582
Well, yeah. l'm excited.

14:10.755 --> 14:14.173
l can't believe Nancy's finally gonna be
my wife after all these weeks.

14:15.346 --> 14:17.007
Okay.

14:19.352 --> 14:20.846
Daphne, what are you doing here?

14:21.063 --> 14:22.972
Your receptionist told me
you'd left for court.

14:23.149 --> 14:24.608
- This is not a good time.
- l know.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.066
You're probably in the middle
of a trial, l'll be brief.

14:27.238 --> 14:30.775
Donny, after seeing you
at the restaurant last night,

14:30.952 --> 14:32.780
l want you to know
l'm worried about you.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.750
- Okay. This is about Nancy?
- l'm sure she's a lovely person

14:35.918 --> 14:38.920
and l probably have no right
saying this,

14:39.089 --> 14:41.213
but l hope you're not
rushing into anything.

14:41.425 --> 14:43.419
- Look, Daphne--
- l know, l know.

14:43.595 --> 14:45.554
l'm way out of line here.

14:45.723 --> 14:49.391
But l still care about
what happens to you.

14:49.604 --> 14:52.227
Take the time
to get to know each other.

14:52.442 --> 14:53.902
Believe me, you'll be glad you did

14:54.070 --> 14:56.229
when the day comes
you finally do get married.

14:56.406 --> 14:59.611
- Yes. Hi.
- Well, what do you know, it's here.

15:00.537 --> 15:02.946
l'll meet you inside. l'll be one second.
l'm sorry. Okay?

15:03.124 --> 15:04.667
l'm so sorry.

15:04.877 --> 15:06.918
- My timing is so terrible.
- Not really.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.967
lf you hang around a few minutes,
we can get you on the wedding video.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.668
l really had no idea
you were getting married so soon.

15:12.847 --> 15:16.134
Well, call me crazy, but l've got
a prejudice against long engagements.

15:16.352 --> 15:19.604
- Mom, hi.
- Sweetie, you look so handsome.

15:19.774 --> 15:21.934
lt's you.

15:22.152 --> 15:24.395
- Hello, Mother Douglas.
- Mrs. Douglas.

15:24.614 --> 15:26.822
You have some nerve
showing up here.

15:27.035 --> 15:29.527
You can beg all you want,
but he's not coming back.

15:29.705 --> 15:31.912
- Mom, Mom.
- He's done crying over you.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.041
- Mom, she knows.
- l don't want you to go back.

15:34.211 --> 15:36.336
- Mom-- No, l'm not.
- Don't you dare, don't do it.

15:36.506 --> 15:37.966
DONNY:
l'll see you in a minute.

15:39.219 --> 15:42.387
Look, Daphne, l don't mean
to rush you, but is there anything else?

15:42.557 --> 15:44.135
Just this.

15:44.352 --> 15:48.730
l never really said how sorry l was
about what happened.

15:48.899 --> 15:50.442
l really am.

15:51.904 --> 15:55.026
Well, Daphne,
if it puts your mind at ease,

15:55.201 --> 15:59.746
l know what l'm doing. l'm happy.
l'm ready to go on with my life.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.706
So...

16:02.503 --> 16:06.206
Yeah, no, l'm-- Hey. Goodbye.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.092
Donny.

16:11.934 --> 16:13.762
Congratulations.

16:15.230 --> 16:17.307
Thank you, Daphne.

16:26.789 --> 16:29.246
- Oh, there you are.
- Listen, l got your message.

16:29.418 --> 16:32.420
lt sounded kind of urgent,
so l came right down.

16:32.881 --> 16:34.292
l suppose you read my e-mail.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.460
No, actually,
my computer's been down all day.

16:37.179 --> 16:39.053
But if it's anything like the last one,
well,

16:39.266 --> 16:42.303
then, l guess we'll know
what overheated my hard drive.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.680
MAN: lt'll need a few minutes
to reconnect to the server

16:44.899 --> 16:47.735
- and then it will be up and running.
- Thank you.

16:48.279 --> 16:49.858
Yeah.

16:51.868 --> 16:55.617
So, uh, why did you call me?

16:57.542 --> 16:58.574
Well, Frasier,

17:00.505 --> 17:02.214
l thought we could celebrate.

17:02.424 --> 17:04.833
Really? Celebrate what?

17:05.471 --> 17:07.928
Well, this morning, l was called down
to the conference room

17:08.099 --> 17:09.428
and all the partners were there.

17:09.602 --> 17:12.094
l thought they were going to yell at me
because they found out

17:12.272 --> 17:14.396
l had given you a discount.

17:14.567 --> 17:19.279
But instead,
they told me l made partner.

17:19.491 --> 17:21.531
You gave me a discount?

17:21.744 --> 17:25.031
- l mean, congratulations. Well, gosh.
- Thank you.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.451
Oh, my God,
you certainly deserve it.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.463
What kind of discount?

17:31.634 --> 17:34.839
- You didn't even notice, did you?
- No, no, l did notice. l did.

17:35.056 --> 17:38.308
l swear to God l noticed.
l even pointed it out to Dad.

17:38.519 --> 17:40.976
That's very sweet.

17:42.150 --> 17:44.226
You're the sweet one.

17:46.615 --> 17:50.744
l'm not always sweet.

17:52.498 --> 17:54.658
Oh, Abby.

17:56.462 --> 17:58.206
<i>COMPUTERlSED VOlCE:
You have e-mail.</i>

18:03.139 --> 18:06.011
l'm not reading them.
The office is closed.

18:06.226 --> 18:10.179
That's a very good decision.
That is partner-level thinking.

18:11.025 --> 18:13.778
Wait. What am l thinking?

18:13.946 --> 18:17.032
You've sent me another one of those
naughty e-mails, haven't you?

18:17.201 --> 18:18.945
Maybe we should act this one out.

18:19.121 --> 18:20.865
No, no, actually, l just--

18:21.041 --> 18:23.247
l just forwarded you an ad
for reduced mortgage rates.

18:23.418 --> 18:28.760
- Then why are you blushing, Frasier?
- Because they're embarrassingly low.

18:29.594 --> 18:32.301
- This says, ''Re: Our relationship.''
- All right, you're on to me.

18:32.474 --> 18:37.351
Now, listen, come here
and sit down and relax.

18:37.523 --> 18:40.976
And l will read it to you.

18:41.904 --> 18:46.283
Prepare to be scandalised.

18:49.165 --> 18:50.576
''Dear Abby.

18:51.710 --> 18:54.119
l read your column every week.''
l'm kidding.

18:56.759 --> 18:58.005
Uh...

18:58.178 --> 19:01.180
No, okay, okay, this time this is
the real stuff now, all right. Um...

19:04.395 --> 19:08.477
''l'm lying here in bed

19:08.652 --> 19:13.861
and l can't stop thinking about you.''

19:14.034 --> 19:15.660
This is getting good.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.446
Oh, you like that, do you? All right.

19:21.128 --> 19:24.830
''Your golden hair cascades

19:25.009 --> 19:28.545
down your bare shoulders,

19:28.847 --> 19:31.803
and l kiss the curve
at the back of your neck.''

19:32.687 --> 19:35.262
l'm very lonely over here.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.776
- Oh, gosh, l've deleted it by accident.
- Oh, no, that's too bad.

19:38.946 --> 19:41.438
l really wanted to hear
the rest of that.

19:43.829 --> 19:47.875
Well, you know what?
We can write a new ending together.

19:48.293 --> 19:50.085
But there's no need to rush.

19:50.254 --> 19:53.590
Listen, we'll just start

19:53.760 --> 19:57.841
very slowly at the beginning.

19:59.518 --> 20:05.107
And then we'll move gently
into the middle.

20:05.819 --> 20:11.825
And then l'm sure you'll want to add
a few plot twists of your own.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.446
Then finally we'll just--

20:14.999 --> 20:16.031
What are you reading?

20:16.585 --> 20:18.958
Your e-mail.
You printed it by mistake.

20:19.131 --> 20:21.373
You think l'm ripping you off?

20:21.550 --> 20:23.628
No. No, no,
l did not use those words.

20:23.845 --> 20:26.338
Actually, l just took issue
with a couple of figures.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.267
And you come in here
and lie to me?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.020
No, ''lie'' is a very strong word.

20:30.689 --> 20:33.893
Well, so is ''chiseller.''

20:34.111 --> 20:37.528
Listen, Abby,
l realise l've made a terrible mistake.

20:37.699 --> 20:40.274
And l wrote some very harsh things.

20:40.495 --> 20:42.785
But, to my credit,
l did attempt to delete it

20:42.957 --> 20:45.284
before you had a chance to read it.

20:46.128 --> 20:48.537
- Get out.
- Oh, come on.

20:48.716 --> 20:51.207
Look at the two of us.
We can't stay mad at each other.

20:51.428 --> 20:53.172
l said, get out.

20:56.435 --> 21:00.386
And to think
that l almost slept with you.

21:02.110 --> 21:04.518
FRASlER:
You still can.
