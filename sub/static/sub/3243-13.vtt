00:00.001 --> 00:04.403
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.405 --> 00:06.005
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:09.408
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:12.511
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:15.314
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:17.182
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:21.453
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.455 --> 00:23.589
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.595 --> 00:28.761
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:28.763 --> 00:30.095
       I've collaborated

00:30.097 --> 00:31.196
 With the horsemen in the past.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.565
    <i> War, pestilence, famine,</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.534
          <i> And rose is</i>
     <i> the horseman of death.</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:38.237
So, why are you telling us this
           just now?
                        The man:
                  The apocalypse

00:38.239 --> 00:40.739
   Is good for the horsemen,
  but very bad for you and me.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.409
They want to break all the seals
     and bring about the rapture

00:43.411 --> 00:46.578
                  And the end of
              humanity. I don't.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.180
     I'd be bored to death.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.182
     How are we supposed to know
          who the antichrist is?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.683
The antichrist will lead you
to the lake of fire.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.285
    What to see my drawing?

00:53.287 --> 00:55.087
    That's the lake of fire.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.088
          Oh, my god.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.090
       Michael. Michael.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.091
          He's alive.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.059
         <i> How am i even</i>

01:00.061 --> 01:01.160
      Supposed to be sure

01:01.162 --> 01:02.294
           That you have my son?
            (squeak)

01:02.296 --> 01:04.430
              Mom!
Sweetie. Give me
back my daughter.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.982
              You lost the right
                to call her that

01:05.983 --> 01:07.533
            When you dragged her
     halfway across the country.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.134
             Stay away from her!

01:09.136 --> 01:10.544
            Joshua:
   <i> They're probably gonna use</i>

01:10.545 --> 01:11.953
      <i> The genesis element</i>
          <i> as some sort</i>

01:11.954 --> 01:13.362
           <i> Of weapon</i>
   <i> to break the fifth seal.</i>

01:13.363 --> 01:14.771
          This element
in the right hands-- our hands--

01:14.775 --> 01:16.842
 It could be a force for good,
           i know it.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.710
   <i> When i was distilling it,</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:21.447
        <i> I felt this rush</i>
      <i> of positive energy.</i>

01:21.449 --> 01:24.450
   <i> Just being near it healed</i>
 <i> a wound that was on my wrist.</i>

01:24.452 --> 01:26.185
             Mark:
    <i> It's the perfect weapon.</i>

01:26.187 --> 01:27.719
           (yelling)
             rose:
         <i> Rest assured,</i>

01:27.721 --> 01:29.755
The fifth seal will bring death

01:29.757 --> 01:33.292
    Like the world has never
          seen before.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.473
 (indistinct, distant shouting)

01:47.475 --> 01:49.808
     (truck engine revving)

01:51.612 --> 01:53.612
     (indistinct shouting)

01:53.614 --> 01:56.782
             Cindy:
      <i> After all this time,</i>

01:56.784 --> 01:58.851
 After all we've been through.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.752
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

02:00.754 --> 02:03.422
       We're almost done.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.257
I always hated the city.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.626
Then it'll be nice
to wipe one off the map.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.230
     We have three more seals to
       break before the rapture.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.899
    We cannot fail the prophecy.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.768
Who said anything about failing?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.137
     (helicopter whirring)

02:18.139 --> 02:21.607
      Never underestimate
        the messengers.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.410
All right, we know
the horsemen have already

02:25.412 --> 02:26.545
Broken the first four seals.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.097
        From this point forward,

02:28.098 --> 02:29.648
    They'll be working together
    to break all the rest.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.782
    And the fifth seal

02:30.784 --> 02:32.217
                     Will be the
                  worst one yet.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.785
According to prophecy,
it will be some kind

02:33.787 --> 02:35.320
 Of violent act that will begin
       a terrible period

02:35.322 --> 02:36.488
    Of fear and tribulation.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.557
   Anybody care to translate
        for the new guy?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.359
Secretary richards,

02:40.361 --> 02:43.262
            The horseman of war.
              We know she turned

02:43.264 --> 02:44.663
      The genesis element
     into a deadly weapon.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.898
                           Erin:
               And mark plowman,

02:45.900 --> 02:47.466
    The horseman of famine,

02:47.468 --> 02:50.169
    Is gonna use his drones
         to deliver it.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.370
       Leland schiller's
  the horseman of pestilence.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.538
        And i bet he's gonna use

02:52.540 --> 02:54.406
              His hacking skills
             to make sure no one

02:54.408 --> 02:55.874
 Can find out what he's up to.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.027
    And then there's death.

02:58.028 --> 03:00.179
                 The horseman in
              charge of 'em all.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.281
Okay, the thing is, now that
she's united with the others,

03:02.283 --> 03:03.615
How do we even stop them?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.350
It's not like
we can kill a horseman.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.486
Remember who said that?

03:07.488 --> 03:10.422
Rose. It's probably just
another one of her lies.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.890
Erin:
But we know from eliza that

03:11.892 --> 03:13.292
  The horsemen have definitely
          been stopped

03:13.294 --> 03:14.560
   From breaking their seals
          in the past.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.694
So, what are we trying to stop?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.396
                     You ask me,

03:17.398 --> 03:19.298
      Based on what i know
    about plowman's drones,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.432
They'll use the same technology

03:20.434 --> 03:21.767
            To launch an attack.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.835
 Instead of seeding the clouds
        with smart rain,

03:23.837 --> 03:25.604
       They could release
      the genesis element.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.705
Joshua:
And pretty soon,

03:26.707 --> 03:27.673
   It'll be raining hellfire.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.274
And everything it touches will

03:29.276 --> 03:30.475
         Turn to dust,
      just like my vision.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.910
                           Vera:
                 How many drones
                      are there?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.512
According to my research, seven.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.415
That's a hell of a lot
of hellfire.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.583
      If we can figure out
    where these drones are,

03:37.585 --> 03:38.717
        I might be able
      to get close enough

03:38.719 --> 03:39.851
  To neutralize the element--

03:39.853 --> 03:40.986
           You know,
   turn it from red to blue.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.621
                     Maybe we'll
                 even get a shot

03:42.622 --> 03:44.255
        At destroying the drones
      altogether if we're lucky.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.426
We're gonna need
a lot more than luck.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.727
        (joshua groans)

03:48.729 --> 03:50.829
    You do this on purpose,
           don't you?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.500
     (high-pitched whirring
   of plane engines, humming)

03:55.502 --> 03:57.936
           (beeping)

03:57.938 --> 03:59.504
        (siren blaring)

03:59.506 --> 04:01.607
           (humming)

04:01.609 --> 04:04.543
           Mom! Mom!

04:08.482 --> 04:10.349
      (thunder crackling)

04:10.351 --> 04:12.884
  (hissing, humming continues)

04:12.886 --> 04:15.354
            (gasps)

04:15.356 --> 04:17.723
     The target is houston.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.892
   So, they're gonna wipe out
         an entire city

04:20.894 --> 04:22.761
    And break the fifth seal
      while they're at it.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.029
    It's because we're here.
       They want us dead.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.897
      I saw the airport--
        a radar screen,

04:25.899 --> 04:27.499
      Seven objects moving
        across the sky.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.867
            Drones.
I saw someplace

04:28.869 --> 04:31.803
Called the sunbowl motel
burning to the ground.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.338
       Michael was there.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.507
    (computer keyboard keys
   clicking, computer chimes)

04:35.509 --> 04:37.643
         That's here in houston.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.378
                         Joshua:
     He was calling out for you.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.712
     What? What? He's here?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.414
    There is something else.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.855
             I saw
  every last one of us dying.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.636
           (beeping)

05:04.638 --> 05:06.972
           (chiming)

05:06.974 --> 05:08.707
         (crow cawing)

05:08.709 --> 05:12.678
     (chirping and dinging)

05:14.315 --> 05:16.548
           (beeping)

05:16.550 --> 05:18.550
          Tell me what
    i want to hear, leland.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.751
                        I'm only

05:19.753 --> 05:21.453
       One firewall away
        from being able

05:21.455 --> 05:22.954
  To remotely erase any object

05:22.956 --> 05:25.324
               We don't want air
         traffic control to see.

05:25.326 --> 05:29.428
No one will know our drones are
in the sky until it's too late.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.829
         That's my boy.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.031
Now, hurry up and come join us.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.933
   You don't want to miss out
        on all the fun.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.102
       I wouldn't miss it
         for the world.

05:37.104 --> 05:37.969
             (beep)

05:40.674 --> 05:42.708
            (sighs)

05:43.644 --> 05:45.477
You ready to go?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.778
                    Yeah.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.114
Erin and i--
we both really appreciate

05:49.116 --> 05:50.782
You getting amy out of town.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.784
                    No big.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.354
            Where are you going?

05:55.356 --> 05:58.657
We're gonna follow joshua's
vision to the airport.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.092
We have to figure out a way

06:00.094 --> 06:01.927
To stop these horsemen
once and for all, nadia.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.929
                    I know.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.566
                   But could you
              do me a big favor?

06:07.568 --> 06:09.134
What's that?

06:09.136 --> 06:12.771
                 Try not to die.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.806
        Oh, don't worry.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.042
      I always come back.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.551
                I love you, dad.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.490
  I love you, too, sweet girl.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.497
         (phone rings)

06:38.499 --> 06:41.867
   Want to know the best part
about getting your ribs broken?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.835
          Apparently,
     if you're a nice guy,

06:43.837 --> 06:46.471
     The hospital throws in
a six-pack and some pec implants

06:46.473 --> 06:47.773
        Free of charge.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.775
            Alan...

06:49.777 --> 06:51.643
       I need your help.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.911
        What's wrong, v?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.680
   I need to get out of town.
          The horsemen

06:55.682 --> 06:57.048
           Are about
   to use the genesis element

06:57.050 --> 06:58.517
To launch an attack on houston.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.852
   Well... If you're staying,
          i'm staying.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.020
             No.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.656
   Not if you care about me.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.659
            (sighs)

07:07.661 --> 07:09.528
     Look, i need you to...

07:09.530 --> 07:11.830
  I need you to go get michael
            for me.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.832
          What? You...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.517
     You know where he is?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.201
       Yeah, i think so.
 Um, joshua had another vision.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.771
  He's at a motel across town.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.442
        I'm just afraid
      that if i go get him

07:23.444 --> 07:26.211
       Instead of trying
    to stop the horsemen...

07:26.213 --> 07:28.613
  Millions of people are going
      to lose their lives,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.949
       And i'm gonna lose
    my little boy for good.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.620
    You really are an angel,
         you know that?

07:35.622 --> 07:39.558
       (voice breaking):
   Just promise me you'll get
      michael out of town?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.059
   Just tell me where he is.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.512
           All right.

07:43.513 --> 07:45.964
     There's one more stop
 i need you to make on the way.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.901
           (buzzing)

07:57.778 --> 08:00.479
             Jeff:
 <i> How could you just let him go?</i>

08:00.481 --> 08:04.082
Because he's not our son,
and you know it.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.085
It's bad enough the devil
turned us into kidnappers,

08:07.087 --> 08:08.920
But now we're-we're killers.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.089
             I held the bag over
         that woman's head, kay.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.257
                    I don't need
                 to be reminded.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.726
Oh, baby, listen to me.

08:14.728 --> 08:18.163
Now, you know there is no end

08:18.165 --> 08:20.832
To what the devil will try
to make us do.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.536
He will never stop
coming after us.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.538
I can't live like that anymore.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.073
      What do you want me to do?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.708
              Kay, i've been all
          over houston, damn it.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.776
    Every single address listing
    i can find for vera buckley.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.245
      I can't find her anywhere.
Oh.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.248
Keep looking. If we're gonna
burn in hell, at least we can

08:36.250 --> 08:38.250
Go on our own terms.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.653
We have to give brian back
to his real mother.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.092
        (engine revving)

08:50.797 --> 08:52.631
                       (panting)

08:52.633 --> 08:54.099
         Would you knock it off?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.834
     You're gonna get me killed.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.136
You worry too much, ronnie.

08:58.138 --> 09:02.240
Just do what i told you to.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.212
           What did these people

09:07.214 --> 09:08.713
       Do to you, anyway?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.215
   Outlived their usefulness.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.855
  Don't make the same mistake.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.258
        You promise me,

09:20.260 --> 09:21.693
        If i light this place up

09:21.695 --> 09:23.128
          And kill the fairburns
                  and their kid,

09:23.130 --> 09:26.598
  I'll get erin and amy back.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.734
        I swear to god.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.776
    Look, it doesn't matter
           who i am.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.110
    All i'm telling you is,
     someone may be trying

09:39.112 --> 09:41.012
  To hack air traffic control
    at texas metro airport.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.881
          (amy humming
  "this little light of mine")
    check all your systems.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.916
      This is not a joke!

09:44.918 --> 09:49.287
      (humming continues)

09:54.261 --> 09:56.828
           (humming)

10:01.001 --> 10:04.703
             Eliza:
 <i> If you want to save the world</i>
   <i> from the devil's dominion,</i>

10:04.705 --> 10:08.940
You must kill the antichrist.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.111
                       (humming)

10:18.919 --> 10:21.152
           (humming)

10:33.033 --> 10:34.933
            Joshua.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.370
     Look. It's you and me.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.308
        Ah, i see that. (laughs)

10:45.012 --> 10:47.912
                 What are those?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.314
Those are flying spiders,

10:49.316 --> 10:51.249
But you're keeping me safe
from them.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.357
You always keep me safe.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.027
Erin:
Hey, sweetie.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.129
       Ready for a little
     adventure with nadia?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.864
      Yeah.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.666
     Bye, joshua.
                    Oh.

11:10.737 --> 11:11.936
              Bye.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.913
           (sobbing)

11:25.886 --> 11:27.952
   (airplane engine revving)

11:32.459 --> 11:34.910
So let me get this straight:

11:34.911 --> 11:37.362
The preacher has a vision
and you all just... Follow it.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.764
      Along with the other signs
          that god shows us.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.333
Allah, for muslims, i guess.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.202
                Sure, why not?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.370
                 I mean, koa's
                  a buddhist.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.907
               I'm catholic,
           joshua's evangelical.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.875
                  Erin's jewish,
           peter's presbyterian,

11:50.877 --> 11:52.243
              And vera, well...

11:52.245 --> 11:54.979
               Vera believes
           we came from monkeys.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.083
            It's like my old man
                   used to say--

11:58.085 --> 11:59.751
            We're all on our way
                  to disneyland,

11:59.753 --> 12:02.253
     We're just taking different
             roads to get there.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.856
     Covered every back room and
   security center in the entire

12:04.858 --> 12:07.158
  Place. No sign of schiller.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.361
       At least i didn't
   have to take my shoes off.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.330
You put the word out anyway?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.866
            Yeah. After joshua's
                 anonymous call,

12:14.868 --> 12:16.134
               They were already
                  on high alert.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.969
       Then i told them schiller
                was on the fbi's

12:17.971 --> 12:20.805
         Most wanted list. Might
       be targeting the airport.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.407
       After what he did
        at nero health,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.142
 I hope they take it seriously.
                 They did a full

12:24.144 --> 12:27.212
 Security sweep. If he's in this
    airport, no one's found him.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.813
Then where could he be?

12:28.815 --> 12:30.081
             Vera:
       <i> Maybe we can find</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:33.284
                Leland somewhere
                in the terminal.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.153
          Do you think
    joshua's vision is true?

12:35.155 --> 12:36.755
    Are we really gonna die?

12:36.757 --> 12:39.991
        Scientifically speaking,
    we're all gonna die someday.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.994
          But not today. We have
            too much work to do.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.897
Sucks having
to save the world.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.100
    Hey, maybe when we get done,
         you can take out nadia.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.169
And you can
finally find your son.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.206
I'll look around on this level,
      you cover the next.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.275
                   Cool.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.920
           (squeaks)

13:08.922 --> 13:10.872
                           Meow.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.823
  Woman: Vera buckley, please
     proceed to the nearest

13:12.826 --> 13:14.325
     White courtesy phone.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.929
          Vera buckley
  to the white courtesy phone.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.131
    Who would be calling...?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.800
            Michael?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.868
            <i> Michael!</i>

13:27.307 --> 13:29.207
         I'm so sorry.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.342
       Don't be. There's nothing
            you could have done.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.211
                    Take my word
                         for it.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.079
Why did you take him
from me in the first place?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.348
What makes him
so special to you?

13:37.350 --> 13:41.252
          Did you ever think why
          you named him michael?

13:42.255 --> 13:44.122
            Is it a family name?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.490
                   Has it always
                 been a favorite

13:45.492 --> 13:48.126
                  Or did it just
                    come to you?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.562
                        You see,
                     vera, every

13:50.564 --> 13:55.834
  Generation of messengers has a
   michael somewhere among them.

13:55.836 --> 13:59.170
       Your son is an archangel.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.539
What's that supposed to mean?

14:01.541 --> 14:02.941
            What do i look like,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.576
           A theology professor?
                   Read a bible.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.444
                In the meantime,
                      know this:

14:06.446 --> 14:08.513
                      You're not
               getting him back.
     He belongs

14:08.515 --> 14:10.882
             To me.
                      I know how
                       you feel.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.051
         No, you can't
      imagine how i feel.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.586
               Believe me, i do.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.888
               'cause now i have
              a child of my own.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.390
                   That's right.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.927
              For the very first
                time in my long,

14:22.929 --> 14:25.129
                 Miserable life,

14:25.131 --> 14:27.532
              The antichrist has
                finally arrived.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.203
                    A messiah of
                    my very own.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.539
                   Someone i can
                     watch over.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.140
                   Just like god

14:36.142 --> 14:38.076
               Watches over you.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.415
         What is that?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.886
         The gps coordinates for
     the horsemen's launch site.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.021
          I strongly suggest you
        get the hell out of here

14:50.023 --> 14:53.024
          And stop those drones,
   vera, because if you don't...

14:53.026 --> 14:55.994
       You're gonna have a whole
     lot of blood on your hands.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.155
        Okay, professor.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.125
          You want the good news
                or the bad news?

15:27.127 --> 15:30.995
Uh, wow, let's get
the bad out of the way.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.363
          You're not going home.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.632
  Vera asked me to come get you,

15:34.634 --> 15:37.068
   So you're gonna have to leave
     your car here; i'm driving.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.405
         Okay, then...

15:40.407 --> 15:42.507
Where are we going, and-and why
  didn't she call me herself?

15:42.509 --> 15:45.143
                Well, hopefully,
           that's the good news.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.611
             It's about michael.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.717
 Car's loaded and ready to go.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.285
                      Thank you.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.154
        Did you put your crayons
               in your backpack?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.422
              Yup.
                        I expect

15:57.424 --> 15:59.691
          A lot of drawings when
            you come back, okay?

15:59.693 --> 16:01.326
      Why can't you come?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.661
               I really want to.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.531
      I just... I have something
    important that i need to do.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.699
          Angel stuff?

16:07.701 --> 16:11.369
              Yeah. Angel stuff.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.741
      I love you so much and i'm
       gonna see you soon, okay?

16:16.743 --> 16:20.011
      Love you, too, mom.
                Okay, come here.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.384
        Be good for nadia, okay?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.991
You're gonna

16:32.993 --> 16:35.293
Go join the others?
                    Yeah.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.329
Well, we'll call you
when we get to tulsa.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.465
My mom said we could
stay there as long as we need.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.233
           Oh, thanks, nadia.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.068
               You're a godsend.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.070
         (short laugh)
        coming from you,

16:46.072 --> 16:48.539
   That's pretty high praise.
(soft laugh)

16:50.243 --> 16:51.709
                  Thanks.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.615
                     Hey.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.684
I'm sorry.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.055
                           Rose:
                   How touching.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.023
  But you know what they say:

17:06.026 --> 17:09.093
 The family that cries together
         dies together.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.637
             Raul:
       They sure circled
    the wagons on this one.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.307
                But i can
                definitely

17:23.309 --> 17:25.175
See why.
I'm counting

17:25.178 --> 17:26.644
                       All seven
                         drones.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.646
Peter:
And at least 20 mercenaries.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.516
                           Vera:
   They probably don't even know
         what they're defending.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.352
        How do we get past them
         to disable the drones?

17:34.354 --> 17:36.254
Maybe you can shape-shift
into one of the guards.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.256
     Get me down close enough to
      where i can spirit-walk in

17:38.258 --> 17:39.757
To figure out how
they're launching those things.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.061
             Raul:
       Yeah. Then we can
       have you blow the

17:43.063 --> 17:44.562
      Power so the drones
        can't take off.
                            Hmm.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.797
                          Cindy:
                     Great idea.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.334
  But i'm gonna have to pass.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.769
         (horn honking)

17:56.676 --> 17:58.109
             Alan:
         Whoa, hang on.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.510
           (honking)

17:59.512 --> 18:00.678
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:02.215 --> 18:04.082
           Excuse me.
           (honking)

18:04.084 --> 18:05.316
        Coming through!

18:05.318 --> 18:07.351
Damn it, alan, where's the fire?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.420
 Uh, right here if we don't get
   the hell out of this town.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.456
You said this was about michael.
                          It is.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.091
                   Seeing as how
              vera's his mother,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.359
     And she wants us both alive
        long enough to find him.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.545
What's that supposed to mean?

18:17.546 --> 18:19.730
   Well, your ex has got a whole
     lot on her plate right now.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.366
Believe me, i'm still trying to
wrap my head around half of it.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.302
But i can tell you this much.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.504
I think you guys are this close
      to finding your kid.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.306
        How do you know?

18:28.308 --> 18:29.540
     'cause i was with her
         in albuquerque

18:29.542 --> 18:31.009
     A couple of days ago,

18:31.010 --> 18:32.477
     When we found the home
    of michael's kidnappers.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.479
It was obviously left
in a hurry.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.180
That means they're on the run,

18:36.182 --> 18:38.116
      And sooner or later,
     they're gonna slip up.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.519
  You must be pretty important
            to vera

18:41.521 --> 18:43.254
   If she's got you involved
          in all this.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.857
Tell you the god's honest truth,

18:45.859 --> 18:48.259
 I think i'm in love with her.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.396
       (tires squealing)
              oh!

18:54.868 --> 18:55.867
           (panting)

18:55.869 --> 18:57.502
            (gasps)

18:57.504 --> 18:59.470
         (horn blaring)
      are you kidding me?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.372
             Now?!

19:01.374 --> 19:02.807
Welcome to houston.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.509
I always said
i'd probably die in traffic.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.743
        (horns blaring)

19:05.745 --> 19:08.679
   Be careful what you wish for.

19:20.226 --> 19:23.194
(indistinct radio transmissions)

19:23.196 --> 19:24.629
         Zahir zakaria.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.364
        Good to see you.

19:26.366 --> 19:30.468
  What? One dry desert wasteland
          wasn't enough for you?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.170
      Do you know how many
        innocent people

19:32.172 --> 19:33.538
  You and your brother killed

19:33.540 --> 19:36.407
With your so-called
smart rain in mali?

19:36.409 --> 19:37.475
          Good people.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.709
           <i> My</i> people.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.745
                         I know.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.547
And i felt bad about it, i did,

19:42.549 --> 19:45.449
         But honestly,
    it's small potatoes now.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.784
                           Yeah.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.588
        My eyes have been opened
       to a far greater purpose.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.390
         So have mine.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.462
           Look out!

20:07.440 --> 20:10.541
       I'm going to kill
      that son of a bitch!

20:10.543 --> 20:11.742
           Zahir, no!

20:15.448 --> 20:16.614
Go, we got him!
              Go.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.550
            (groans)

20:19.552 --> 20:20.785
                            Hey.

20:20.787 --> 20:21.786
           You okay?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.621
           Leave me.
                          Sorry.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.756
 We leave no messenger behind.
            Come on.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.934
      (mechanical humming)

20:43.409 --> 20:45.009
 You thinking what i'm thinking?

20:45.011 --> 20:47.345
Hell, yes.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.891
Leland, the messengers are here.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.493
                  Just keep them

21:02.495 --> 21:04.495
      Away from the drones
 and out of this command tent,

21:04.497 --> 21:06.530
And we won't have any problems.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.632
               Oh, and tell rose

21:07.634 --> 21:08.866
     That we're good to go.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.868
           Go where?

21:10.870 --> 21:12.837
   Back home to your mother?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.841
Remember me?

21:17.910 --> 21:20.511
    I should have done this
        a long time ago.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.414
                           Yeah.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.516
   I suppose you should have.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.618
         (crows cawing)

21:27.620 --> 21:29.687
          Stay close.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.293
Freeze!

21:35.295 --> 21:36.827
          Sorry, boys.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.996
  That's the end of the road.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.945
                           Rose:
                  Step away from
               the drones, vera.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.548
           Don't worry about us.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.423
    I'm-i'm sorry. I can't.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.791
                           Rose:
                  Of course not.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.526
      Aren't you an angel?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.928
              Move it. Let's go.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.431
        Everybody down!

22:13.433 --> 22:14.765
On your knees!

22:14.767 --> 22:16.901
Rose:
It's so nice
to see you all again.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.437
It's a shame we don't have time
          to catch up,

22:19.439 --> 22:21.339
But...
We've got a fifth seal

22:21.341 --> 22:22.606
           To break.

22:22.608 --> 22:23.741
The man:
If i could just interject

22:23.743 --> 22:25.776
                   For a moment.
                          I know

22:25.778 --> 22:27.812
         How god works.

22:27.814 --> 22:28.879
                     He loves to
                     give humans

22:28.881 --> 22:30.581
All the tools
they need

22:30.583 --> 22:32.850
      For their salvation
        and destruction.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.585
   That's clearly what he did

22:34.587 --> 22:36.120
        With the meteor
      he cast me down in.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.456
     I'll be the first to admit,
      the whole genesis element,

22:38.458 --> 22:40.391
    I didn't see it coming.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.928
    But you're just like me
        in that respect.

22:43.930 --> 22:47.398
If you think god's gonna reward
   you for blindly following

22:47.400 --> 22:49.934
   The prophecy and launching
         those weapons,

22:49.936 --> 22:53.404
      You're about to fail
    the biggest test of all.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.842
You dare speak to me of failure?

23:09.889 --> 23:12.390
           (grunting)

23:13.726 --> 23:15.993
                  It's like i've
                    always said,

23:15.995 --> 23:17.495
    We're stronger than you.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.602
         Go for launch.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.076
           (whirring)

23:50.196 --> 23:52.730
             Rose.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.032
     Please don't do this.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.936
              See?

23:58.938 --> 24:02.106
That's the problem with mankind.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.209
You always think
everything's being done <i> to</i> you.

24:05.211 --> 24:08.679
   You never hold yourselves
          accountable.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.648
      My son's been taken.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.084
My husband's
abusive.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.620
    My father was murdered.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.790
    My parents abandoned me.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.160
     My brother was killed.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.831
My village
was destroyed.

24:26.833 --> 24:30.568
   My daddy screwed my whore
           of a wife.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.603
You're
all weak.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.773
     You always have been.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.510
And that is why it is
finally time for you to die.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.011
Humanity
deserves

24:41.013 --> 24:43.047
Everything that's coming to it.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.050
           (beeping)
        they've reached

24:46.052 --> 24:48.052
The cloud barrier.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.522
                Then release the
                genesis element.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.796
           (beeping)

24:58.798 --> 25:00.197
      (lightning crashes)

25:00.199 --> 25:02.533
      We're almost there.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.271
       (thunder rumbles)

25:19.986 --> 25:21.852
   Come on, come on, come on.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.823
      (people exclaiming)

25:25.825 --> 25:28.526
Why are people
leaving their cars?

25:30.062 --> 25:33.931
       Uh... They're just trying
          to stretch their legs.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.301
               I have never seen
             anything like this.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.903
Neither have i.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.237
Look, professor,
we gotta get out of here.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.241
  (people shouting, screaming)

25:46.245 --> 25:48.312
                 It's too late.

25:55.588 --> 25:56.854
        (woman screams)

25:56.856 --> 25:58.923
       (thunder rumbles)

26:05.698 --> 26:07.197
       Looks like there's
        a fire up ahead.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.266
                    Brother, you
                   have no idea.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.841
        Where's my mom?

26:17.843 --> 26:19.710
  I... I don't know, sweetie.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.813
      But... Don't worry,
   we're just gonna stay put.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.648
       (thunder crashes)

26:26.218 --> 26:28.752
     You're wrong about us.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.290
        We're not weak.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.597
   And we fought to stop you
         at every turn.

26:40.866 --> 26:44.635
       And we don't live
      in the past anymore.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.170
       So if the future's
       too late to save,

26:46.172 --> 26:48.672
   Let me tell you this much
           right now.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.344
      It was all worth it.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.680
  My faith has been restored.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.351
            In god.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.356
           In myself.

27:05.358 --> 27:09.293
     And in every last one
        of these people.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.231
Joshua:
Now...

27:14.233 --> 27:15.966
                If it's the last
                    thing we do,

27:15.968 --> 27:17.768
       We're gonna pray.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.105
                           Vera:
                   Really? We're
                just gonna pray?

27:22.375 --> 27:23.974
                  No.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.309
              Listen to me.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.410
           We can still do this.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.212
        How? The drones
     have already launched.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.948
      There's a generator
      by the command tent.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.683
             If we can get zahir
        close enough to kill it,

27:32.685 --> 27:33.684
                   We would stop
                      the drones

27:33.686 --> 27:35.185
                      From doing
                      their job.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.720
   But there's about 50 guns
    between here and there.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.025
We have to be
a human shield.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.730
              It's the only way.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.902
         For ourselves,

27:51.904 --> 27:54.171
         For each other

27:54.173 --> 27:56.740
   And for everyone we love.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.143
        You really think
    that god is watching us?

28:02.114 --> 28:04.148
                   I know he is.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.720
            Then i'm in.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.023
      Me, too.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.692
       Yes.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.794
               Let's do it.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.895
        I can't think of
    a better reason to die.

28:24.070 --> 28:24.968
         Fire!

28:24.970 --> 28:26.236
           (gunshots)

28:26.238 --> 28:28.939
              ¶ ¶

28:58.270 --> 29:00.003
              ¶ ¶

29:13.753 --> 29:16.487
           (beeping)

29:46.185 --> 29:48.252
              ¶ ¶

29:53.926 --> 29:56.860
   I knew you were watching.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.131
          (screaming)

30:03.502 --> 30:05.569
              ¶ ¶

30:33.232 --> 30:36.366
         Does this mean
   we're not going to tulsa?

30:36.368 --> 30:38.268
             Yeah.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.845
                  Thank you.

30:57.122 --> 31:00.057
          Oh. Oh, god.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.392
      I'm so sorry for...

31:02.394 --> 31:04.461
   For everything i've done.

31:08.033 --> 31:11.501
        (siren blaring,
      indistinct shouting)

31:18.477 --> 31:20.210
  (garbled radio transmission)

31:20.212 --> 31:22.279
      (thunder crackling)

31:24.016 --> 31:26.984
      What do i do now, v?

31:26.986 --> 31:29.052
   Please tell me you did it.

31:33.058 --> 31:36.093
             Alan?

31:37.062 --> 31:40.430
I can feel my legs.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.600
I can walk.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.570
            (groans)

31:46.572 --> 31:48.906
        (siren blaring)

31:48.908 --> 31:50.274
(panting)

31:51.243 --> 31:53.310
          Oh, my god.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.499
        (soft groaning)

32:15.501 --> 32:18.068
        (coughs, groans)

32:18.070 --> 32:21.371
           (coughing)

32:21.373 --> 32:24.341
           (panting)

32:24.343 --> 32:27.277
     (coughing and gasping)

32:29.081 --> 32:32.249
           (coughing)

32:32.251 --> 32:35.552
           (groaning)

32:40.059 --> 32:43.193
           We did it.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.495
Thank god.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.264
We finally beat the horsemen.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.067
           (laughing)

32:50.069 --> 32:53.236
           (laughter)

33:00.646 --> 33:03.246
           (laughter)

33:23.402 --> 33:25.469
           It's over.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.270
              No.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.539
  (in distorted, deep voice):
      It's just beginning.

33:36.515 --> 33:40.250
    (whirring and whooshing)

33:44.623 --> 33:47.190
        (phone ringing)

33:53.265 --> 33:56.266
   Alan. Alan, te-te-tell me
          you're okay.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.472
    (siren sounds and toots)

34:02.474 --> 34:04.541
  (garbled radio transmission)

34:11.683 --> 34:14.150
  (garbled radio transmission)

34:16.054 --> 34:18.121
     (indistinct shouting)

34:20.592 --> 34:22.759
              Leo?

34:22.761 --> 34:25.094
Wait. Alan.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.396
        (siren blaring)

34:26.398 --> 34:27.731
                 It's a miracle.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.632
        (siren blaring)

34:29.635 --> 34:31.333
             But that's not all.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.335
                Vera...

34:33.338 --> 34:37.074
                 There's someone
               you need to meet.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.782
I'll be right back.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.857
          Hi, sweetie.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.194
                           Look,

34:57.196 --> 35:00.864
I know you don't know me,

35:00.866 --> 35:04.568
But i promise i know you.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.139
(voice breaking):
I've been looking for you

35:09.141 --> 35:12.609
For a very long time.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.451
        (siren blaring,
       car horns tooting)

35:24.256 --> 35:26.256
             Vera:
       Slow down, silly.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.258
                  Don't drink it
                 all in one sip.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.693
                        (laughs)

35:29.695 --> 35:31.261
Want to play
on the patio?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.596
         Is that okay?

35:32.598 --> 35:34.731
              Of course you can.
                Now go have fun.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.602
How's he doing?

35:38.604 --> 35:41.404
                 Remarkably well

35:41.406 --> 35:43.874
            For a kid who's been
            through what he has.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.677
                 We've been, uh,
             seeing a therapist.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.846
        It's gonna be a journey.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.781
           It'll take some time.

35:51.783 --> 35:55.185
             Probably a few more
                shirley temples.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.821
And how about you?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.823
        To be honest...

35:59.825 --> 36:03.593
I'm happier than i've ever been.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.731
     (billiard balls clack)

36:07.733 --> 36:09.332
       (video game chirps
          and chimes)

36:09.334 --> 36:11.334
You know, i can see
in the reflection

36:11.336 --> 36:12.702
That you're staring at me.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.505
You're just gonna keep doing it?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.742
        If you're lucky.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.379
          (both laugh)

36:25.217 --> 36:26.750
What about cell phones?

36:26.752 --> 36:29.653
Bet you don't even
need a charger, do you?

36:31.390 --> 36:32.889
          (whooshing)

36:32.891 --> 36:35.358
    No way. That is so cool.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.260
                        (laughs)
erin:
No matter how many times

36:37.262 --> 36:39.296
I read it, i just
don't believe it.

36:39.297 --> 36:41.331
Well, all that matters now is
that he turned himself in,

36:41.333 --> 36:42.499
                 And we're done.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.268
      Maybe now you can move on.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.537
        Where?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.339
                       Colorado.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.374
          (laughing):
             What?

36:51.376 --> 36:52.909
That's...

36:52.911 --> 36:55.879
   Look, i know it's not alaska,
       but it's still beautiful.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.282
 And now that my record's clear,

36:59.284 --> 37:02.552
  There's a dea branch in denver
         that i can transfer to.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.256
   You and amy can come with me.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.875
                     Nadia, too,
                   if she wants.

37:08.876 --> 37:11.493
    We can find a house, you can
 go back to work... If you want.

37:11.496 --> 37:14.431
            We can start a whole
              new life together.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.501
           Does that sound good?

37:18.503 --> 37:22.772
              No.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.841
        It sounds great.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.517
           Dude, you're stripes.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.653
  What are you talking about?
          I'm solids.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.022
      Plus, you scratched.
   Give me the damn cue ball.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.491
      You want to come get
       the damn cue ball?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.893
         You do realize
     i can walk now, right?

37:43.895 --> 37:44.928
            (laughs)

37:44.930 --> 37:46.263
      We can remedy that.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.530
Fine. Keep the cue ball.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.799
I'm really proud of everyone.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.702
We gave it everything we had
and made the ultimate sacrifice

37:52.704 --> 37:54.838
To stop another seal
from breaking.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.274
            Yeah, we kicked ass.
You're right we did.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.342
           (laughter)

38:00.846 --> 38:03.346
Guess the question is:
What do we do next?

38:03.348 --> 38:05.548
            Think i'm just gonna
        focus on being a mother.

38:05.550 --> 38:08.752
Yeah... Well, i'm not
telling you you shouldn't.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.821
God knows you've
earned it, vera.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.456
                      But?

38:13.458 --> 38:16.293
But we still have our gifts.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.695
           So, what? Aren't they
     supposed to just fade away?

38:18.697 --> 38:21.464
Eliza said we won't lose them
till we were truly finished.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.500
But the thing is...

38:23.502 --> 38:27.370
Is we're the seventh group
of messengers.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.340
And i just can't shake this
feeling we still got work to do.

38:30.342 --> 38:33.310
                         Lookit.

38:33.312 --> 38:36.513
         I know you and i aren't
               very fond of him.

38:37.849 --> 38:41.651
  But when i was at the airport,

38:41.653 --> 38:44.421
   The devil told me something i
    haven't been able to forget.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.589
What did he say?

38:49.528 --> 38:51.594
    That michael's an archangel.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.432
                  I'm not saying
             that i believe him.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.033
           I don't, i don't even
         know what that means...

38:57.035 --> 38:58.668
An archangel...

38:58.670 --> 39:01.404
Is a powerful warrior of god.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.343
Maybe we still have our gifts
'cause we need to protect him.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.945
          Protect him from what?

39:08.947 --> 39:10.680
The antichrist.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.687
The antichrist is
a human cloaked in darkness

39:17.689 --> 39:19.556
Who can do things
the devil can't.

39:19.558 --> 39:20.724
              Like what exactly?

39:20.726 --> 39:23.426
Destroy an archangel.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.495
Now, look.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.031
I might be wrong about this.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.866
I sure as hell hope that i am.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.006
But i think amy is
the antichrist.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.776
                     What?

39:39.778 --> 39:42.078
She showed me the lake of fire.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.114
Now, that is written
in prophecy...

39:44.116 --> 39:45.515
                  This is crazy!

39:45.517 --> 39:47.050
             They're not demons.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.153
           They're not warriors.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.921
                   They're kids.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.995
           High one!

40:00.799 --> 40:03.466
                  So, i'm sorry.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.771
                But the prophecy
                has to be wrong.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.546
             Yeah.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.949
      Yeah, you're right.
            (laughs)

40:19.951 --> 40:22.685
     God's been good to us.

40:22.687 --> 40:25.155
     Why would he stop now?

40:44.509 --> 40:46.576
Here you go, my child.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.912
              Thank you, father.
