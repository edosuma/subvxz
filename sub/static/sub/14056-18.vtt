00:00.042 --> 00:01.550
Previously on the O.C.:

00:01.551 --> 00:03.027
Hey, if you need anything else, let me know.

00:03.028 --> 00:03.513
Thanks.

00:03.514 --> 00:04.637
I want you to leave Ryan alone.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.397
You must really think I'm gonna hurt him.

00:06.398 --> 00:09.548
I chickened out, which is kind of my go-to move these days,

00:09.549 --> 00:11.050
but I'm rescheduling the interview.

00:11.051 --> 00:11.874
It's Maya Griffin.

00:11.875 --> 00:14.331
Whose father's the head of the physician's board?

00:14.332 --> 00:17.353
I'm totally cool about turning your apartment into the Playboy grotto.

00:17.352 --> 00:18.372
- I'm Jess.
- Trey.

00:18.371 --> 00:20.836
I've always had this fantasy about two brothers.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.129
I want you out of Newport.

00:22.126 --> 00:24.625
- We could take off together.
- Where would we go?

00:25.007 --> 00:25.906
Vegas.

00:25.907 --> 00:26.922
Marissa and I are broken up.

00:26.923 --> 00:29.011
I'm glad you finally made your decision.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.446
Cohen, your Brown interview is, like, in 11 hours.

00:40.447 --> 00:41.952
Don't you think you should be prepping for it?

00:41.953 --> 00:43.800
Nope. I've got a new approach to interviews.

00:43.801 --> 00:45.171
It's called "don't think about it."

00:45.172 --> 00:47.325
I guess that's better than your last approach.

00:47.479 --> 00:48.906
Hey, what's all that?

00:49.186 --> 00:53.126
A little half-time buffet-- pretzels, Ding Dongs, jar of gefilte fish.

00:53.127 --> 00:53.953
Just trying to mix it up.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.220
That's always appreciated.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.495
Ryan, you ready for a rematch?

00:56.496 --> 00:57.565
Oh, do we have to?

00:57.566 --> 00:59.207
I thought I called winners.

01:00.305 --> 01:04.058
No offense, I just don't think you should step into the ring with me.

01:04.059 --> 01:07.639
Yeah, before Ryan and I came, Playstation was pretty much his best friend.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.318
Come on. One game, Seth.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.252
My controller.

01:10.253 --> 01:11.711
Ryan, will you come get drinks with me, please?

01:11.712 --> 01:12.650
Yes.

01:13.428 --> 01:14.404
Okay, you ready?

01:14.405 --> 01:16.158
This is my lucky controller.

01:18.837 --> 01:21.787
So, Atwood, seems like you're really moving on.

01:21.788 --> 01:23.658
Yeah, trying to.

01:23.873 --> 01:27.477
Well, I promise, no weirdness from me.

01:27.478 --> 01:33.026
I mean, Coop's my best friend, but I've also accepted the fact that you and Marissa...

01:33.027 --> 01:34.131
Not really meant to be.

01:34.132 --> 01:37.993
Which is why it's good that you've found the opposite of Marissa.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.320
You really think Sadie is Marissa's opposite?

01:40.321 --> 01:42.621
And game over!

01:42.622 --> 01:44.564
Whoa, dude, you got killed already?

01:44.565 --> 01:47.766
I'm humbled, man, I am humbled and mortified.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.521
It's okay, I can't take all the credit.

01:50.522 --> 01:52.673
I found a cheat code on the Internet.

01:52.674 --> 01:54.167
Ryan, this one's a keeper, man.

01:54.168 --> 01:55.075
Anti-Coop.

01:55.076 --> 01:59.399
Who knew my new Playstation idol would be your new girlfr... Your new, like a...

01:59.400 --> 02:01.249
- Friend.
- Friend, girl, friend.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.315
- Nice save.
- I think "friend" is the word.

02:03.316 --> 02:04.388
I'm gonna get that.

02:04.389 --> 02:05.771
- Nice dodge.
- Thanks.

02:05.772 --> 02:08.005
"Friend" was what I was looking for.

02:12.817 --> 02:13.867
Ryan.

02:14.846 --> 02:15.678
Jess.

02:15.679 --> 02:17.597
Oh, good, you recognize me.

02:17.598 --> 02:19.107
Even with the new look.

02:19.201 --> 02:21.551
Yeah, kind of came with the new life.

02:22.731 --> 02:24.474
Listen, I brought you something.

02:24.659 --> 02:27.938
It's a belated birthday present from your brother.

02:29.439 --> 02:30.761
You still keep in touch with him?

02:30.762 --> 02:33.705
Yeah. I lived with him out in Vegas for a while.

02:34.332 --> 02:36.255
Just got back a few months ago.

02:38.101 --> 02:39.399
Here.

02:42.678 --> 02:43.917
Thanks.

02:44.211 --> 02:46.354
Don't you want to know how he's doing?

02:46.969 --> 02:48.200
Hey.

02:50.556 --> 02:53.958
Ryan, if you want to talk, you know where I live.

02:57.021 --> 02:58.025
Who was that?

02:58.026 --> 02:59.195
Nobody.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.992
Let's just go back inside.

03:02.378 --> 03:03.801
Come on, you're up next.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.025 --> 03:58.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:01.539 --> 04:04.263
You know, I know Trey's not made of money or anything, but

04:04.342 --> 04:06.656
he could have at least sprung for a shirt or something.

04:06.657 --> 04:08.258
It's an inside thing. Long story.

04:08.259 --> 04:09.944
I like long stories.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.976
Too bad. I don't feel like telling this one.

04:12.977 --> 04:15.152
Breakfast is ready in the kitchen.

04:15.442 --> 04:18.613
Oh, I haven't seen one of those in years.

04:18.615 --> 04:21.836
Do you remember when your dad and I used to buy these for you?

04:21.837 --> 04:24.160
Couldn't for the life of us get you to play with them.

04:24.161 --> 04:25.293
Where'd you find this, anyway?

04:25.294 --> 04:26.444
T rey.

04:26.940 --> 04:28.468
A friend of his dropped it off.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.602
You remember Jess?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.636
Charming girl who took too much X and floated face down in a pool?

04:32.637 --> 04:35.843
Yeah, she moved to Vegas with Trey, and they lived together.

04:35.844 --> 04:37.580
Well, how is he? Is he okay?

04:37.808 --> 04:40.656
I don't know. Figured he's out of my life.

04:40.721 --> 04:42.357
Why get back into it?

04:44.152 --> 04:46.315
Well, breakfast is ready.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.614
What are you doing?

05:00.615 --> 05:02.116
Thought you'd be at school.

05:02.117 --> 05:04.815
So you were just gonna lurk around my house while I wasn't home?

05:04.816 --> 05:06.631
Came to drop something off.

05:12.893 --> 05:14.649
I thought you were gonna sell this.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.285
This watch was really expensive.

05:16.286 --> 05:19.848
No, I, uh, I decided to hang on to it.

05:20.438 --> 05:22.680
And now you're giving it back?

05:22.681 --> 05:25.437
Well, there's a surprise twist. Thanks.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.899
Anything else?

05:34.486 --> 05:36.887
Look, I just want to be alone right now.

05:36.888 --> 05:39.526
Yeah. Yeah, no, you look busy.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.453
Listen, I'm gonna be at the beach tonight. Maybe I'll see you.

05:42.454 --> 05:43.982
Don't count on it.

05:54.474 --> 05:57.168
No, you're the man, sir.

05:57.169 --> 05:58.824
Okay, I'll see you soon.

05:58.825 --> 05:59.932
So?

05:59.933 --> 06:02.525
Turns out the guy is a huge anime fan.

06:02.526 --> 06:05.399
We got into the whole Akira vs. Ghost in the Shell debate.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.890
Both came down on Ghost in the Shell.

06:07.881 --> 06:12.109
I have no idea what you're saying, but I'm so happy for you.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.786
I'm going to go call my parents, tell them to start packing my bags.

06:14.787 --> 06:16.604
Congratulations, baby!

06:16.605 --> 06:18.636
Oh, holy Kodak moment.

06:18.637 --> 06:21.231
Oh, I guess Seth just aced his Brown interview.

06:21.232 --> 06:23.819
That's  fantastic! We're so gonna party tonight.

06:23.820 --> 06:25.273
I'll make a flan.

06:25.328 --> 06:29.826
Oh, you know what, Taylor, actually, Seth and I were thinking about hanging out alone.

06:29.827 --> 06:31.927
My dad's out of town, we have the house to ourselves.

06:31.928 --> 06:34.978
Oh. Say no more.

06:35.089 --> 06:36.151
- Hmm.
- What?

06:36.152 --> 06:37.568
- Taylor?
- Hmm?

06:37.887 --> 06:39.132
What's wrong with your eye?

06:39.133 --> 06:41.130
It's a knowing wink, Summer.

06:41.131 --> 06:43.804
You and Seth, the house all to yourselves.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.558
Who knows what could happen?

06:45.559 --> 06:48.359
Me. There'll be leftover Thai and the Blade trilogy.

06:49.927 --> 06:54.732
Oh, oh, I didn't realize that you and Seth had lost the magic.

06:54.733 --> 06:57.621
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner. You must be panicking.

06:57.622 --> 07:00.565
Um, okay, I didn't come to you. And why would I panic?

07:00.566 --> 07:03.641
Well, it looks like you two are going to college together.

07:03.642 --> 07:06.300
Don't you worry that Seth's eye will wander?

07:06.301 --> 07:10.512
All the nubile young coeds? You, the familiar old shoe?

07:10.513 --> 07:13.665
Um, I'll have you know, Taylor, that I am, like, five levels hotter than him.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.506
Summer, the libido does not listen to logic.

07:16.507 --> 07:20.206
At this age, men are driven by a reptilian force.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.460
Spread the seed. Spread the seed.

07:23.462 --> 07:25.222
- Spread the...
- Taylor.

07:25.231 --> 07:27.946
If Seth and I go to college together, we will be just fine.

07:27.943 --> 07:31.099
And I'll have you know, we have a very healthy sex life.

07:32.445 --> 07:33.805
Then super.

07:33.806 --> 07:36.741
You have fun tonight. But, Summer, if you ever need to girl talk...

07:36.742 --> 07:38.133
Bye, Taylor.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.493
Hey.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.362
Glad you're home.

07:55.961 --> 07:59.457
Yeah, just walked in. I didn't know you were stopping by.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.655
I need a break from drywalling.

08:02.603 --> 08:04.503
You're still into toy cars?

08:04.946 --> 08:07.275
I choose to find that cute instead of creepy.

08:07.276 --> 08:09.345
It's just something someone gave me.

08:09.346 --> 08:11.361
This wouldn't by any chance have anything to do

08:11.362 --> 08:14.730
with that Hooters waitress that showed up at your doorstep yesterday?

08:14.731 --> 08:17.425
Jess is just a friend of my brother's.

08:17.426 --> 08:19.542
I'd tell you the whole story, but...

08:19.543 --> 08:21.554
But you'd just rather not?

08:22.227 --> 08:23.448
That's cool.

08:23.476 --> 08:26.876
But just know if you do decide to tell me, I will listen.

08:26.976 --> 08:28.634
And without judgment.

08:32.121 --> 08:35.624
Or you can keep it all to yourself. Both are fine with me.

08:43.645 --> 08:46.090
Okay. I'm going to get going.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.377
Dr. Henry Griffin. What a surprise.

08:54.378 --> 08:55.477
I hope you don't mind.

08:55.478 --> 08:57.515
Please, we're building a hospital together.

08:57.516 --> 08:59.876
When all is said and done, we'll be like family.

08:59.877 --> 09:01.622
Hang on a sec, let me get Matt in here.

09:01.623 --> 09:04.024
Um, I'd rather that you didn't.

09:08.555 --> 09:10.691
Board called an impromptu meeting yesterday.

09:10.692 --> 09:14.421
It seems there's been some complaints about your associate.

09:14.422 --> 09:15.877
Complaints?

09:15.878 --> 09:20.805
Rumors. Parties at his house, booze, gambling, God knows what else.

09:20.806 --> 09:23.442
Board's not sure they want to do business with him.

09:24.204 --> 09:26.688
Well, I'll talk to him, make sure he cleans up his act.

09:26.689 --> 09:30.926
This is not about a slap on the wrist, Sandy. We want him off the project.

09:31.731 --> 09:33.879
Matt worked his ass off for this deal.

09:34.802 --> 09:36.691
I couldn't take him off it.

09:37.692 --> 09:41.235
Then I'm afraid we can't go forward with the hospital.

09:41.236 --> 09:42.552
You got to be kidding me.

09:42.553 --> 09:44.709
Take  a few days, mull it over.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.423
Remember, Sandy, this hospital could change everything for you.

09:47.424 --> 09:51.369
You really want to give it all up for one 26-year-old hotshot?

09:58.433 --> 10:00.196
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

10:00.197 --> 10:02.319
What's going on tonight, big plans with Sadie?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.470
Uh... maybe.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.659
I don't know, I haven't really decided yet.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.569
Yeah? What's Plan B?

10:08.862 --> 10:09.757
Jess?

10:10.503 --> 10:12.596
I don't know. I just need to know if Trey's okay.

10:12.597 --> 10:16.143
Well, nothing you hear is going to make it easier that he's not a part of your life.

10:16.185 --> 10:21.495
Listen. As we speak, your new, uh, sometimes, kind-of girlfriend

10:21.496 --> 10:25.708
is probably sitting by, cradling a hunk of plaster, waiting for you to make a move.

10:25.709 --> 10:29.302
So, you can either dwell in the past and go see Jess,

10:29.303 --> 10:32.180
or live for the now, and give Sadie a call.

10:55.134 --> 10:56.895
So, you called.

11:18.639 --> 11:19.588
Marissa.

11:19.589 --> 11:20.801
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:20.802 --> 11:21.967
Come on in.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.235
Thanks.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.569
Just in the neighborhood?

11:25.570 --> 11:27.536
Yeah, I was driving by.

11:28.537 --> 11:30.334
Okay, no, I wasn't.

11:30.335 --> 11:34.663
The truth is, Summer's with Seth and I'm all alone, and I'm kind of going out of my mind.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.915
Well, you know, tomorrow I'm going to go up to L.A., but if you want,

11:37.916 --> 11:40.087
feel free to make this your crash pad for the weekend.

11:40.088 --> 11:41.438
That'd be great.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.237
All right. Make yourself at home.

11:44.595 --> 11:46.743
All right, two down, one to go.

11:46.744 --> 11:50.001
You really want to watch the entire Blade trilogy?

11:50.002 --> 11:52.450
You can't leave the last disc unwatched, it'll feel bad.

11:52.451 --> 11:55.400
Well, I thought tonight was about celebrating your interview.

11:55.401 --> 11:57.523
It  is-- hence the trilogy.

11:58.757 --> 11:59.969
You know...

12:00.914 --> 12:04.620
we could forget the movie, go upstairs...

12:07.543 --> 12:11.705
Mmm, you smell so good.

12:11.706 --> 12:13.027
You like the smell of salami?

12:13.028 --> 12:13.914
Cohen!

12:13.915 --> 12:16.997
What? I had a salami sub. I feel like it's lingering.

12:16.998 --> 12:19.004
Uh! You know what? Just forget it.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.199
Forget what?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.673
I was trying to create a mood.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.644
I know. I know that now.

12:24.645 --> 12:27.176
I was just thrown off a little bit by your approach.

12:27.177 --> 12:30.906
Nuzzling your ear and complimenting you? I wasn't exactly reinventing the wheel.

12:30.907 --> 12:33.930
Normally you just throw me down and do your thing, but I can adjust.

12:33.931 --> 12:35.096
Not interested.

12:35.097 --> 12:36.504
Summer.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.489
You smell good, too.

12:46.490 --> 12:48.199
Press play, before I break your face.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.335
Fine.

12:50.045 --> 12:52.265
Hey, it's Sadie, leave a message.

12:52.266 --> 12:56.046
Hey. So, I know you're painting, but it's Friday night.

12:56.047 --> 12:57.635
I'm making you take a break.

12:57.636 --> 12:59.738
I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay?

12:59.739 --> 13:00.916
Bye.

13:14.225 --> 13:15.513
Hey, Ryan.

13:15.514 --> 13:18.483
I was just about to take a swim, come on in.

13:20.532 --> 13:22.206
Look, I can't stay long.

13:22.207 --> 13:24.868
But you couldn't resist getting the lowdown on your brother?

13:25.619 --> 13:28.514
Guy has a way of sucking you in. I know.

13:29.087 --> 13:30.227
Drink?

13:30.748 --> 13:32.689
Just tell me, is he okay?

13:34.182 --> 13:35.755
Well, he misses you.

13:35.756 --> 13:40.062
Trey's not the type to cry into his pillow every night, but... I can tell.

13:40.063 --> 13:41.388
You know him that well, huh?

13:41.389 --> 13:43.492
Let's just say he's of a certain mold:

13:43.493 --> 13:45.532
angry, damaged, reckless.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.985
It's the kind of guy I go for.

13:46.986 --> 13:49.827
My boyfriend now, Jim, same deal.

13:50.650 --> 13:52.841
We all have our types, don't we?

13:53.340 --> 13:55.249
I tell you what, why don't you stay a while?

13:55.250 --> 13:58.001
Look, Jess, we were never friends.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.697
Got it.

14:01.957 --> 14:03.711
You can go if you want.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.706
Do you know Trey's dealing?

14:11.522 --> 14:14.353
Blackjack. Off the Strip.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.177
So  he's staying out of trouble?

14:16.178 --> 14:17.732
Trying to.

14:19.889 --> 14:22.181
Don't move. I'm going to get some clothes.

14:22.234 --> 14:23.590
Jess?

14:25.369 --> 14:27.385
Just stay a little while.

14:27.386 --> 14:29.656
I have a lot more to tell you about Trey.

15:07.832 --> 15:08.873
Music too loud?

15:08.874 --> 15:14.042
No! It's just the grunting and excessive banging that I'm concerned about.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.138
Sorry.

15:15.464 --> 15:16.751
You okay?

15:17.248 --> 15:18.950
Yeah. Yeah.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.464
Girl problems?

15:21.047 --> 15:24.481
Safe bet, usually, but no. Actually, this is more complicated.

15:24.988 --> 15:26.953
Is it that girl, Jessica?

15:27.086 --> 15:29.409
Yeah. My brother.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.968
Just trying to prevent another casualty of Trey.

15:31.969 --> 15:33.902
So you're trying to save this girl?

15:34.466 --> 15:36.058
Is that something I do?

15:36.131 --> 15:40.929
Look, we love Marissa, she's family, and she means a lot to us.

15:40.930 --> 15:44.004
But she's been through so much, and you got pulled into that.

15:44.005 --> 15:46.108
Yeah, well, some of that was my fault.

15:47.249 --> 15:49.039
But you're right, yeah, I can't argue with you.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.183
You should never argue with a woman who's here to discuss women.

15:52.524 --> 15:55.308
Have we mentioned that we love Sadie?

15:55.309 --> 15:57.265
She's smart and she's grounded.

15:57.266 --> 16:00.837
And I am trying-- trying-- not to screw it up.

16:00.838 --> 16:04.852
Just because a girl isn't tied to some train tracks, doesn't mean that she should be ignored.

16:04.853 --> 16:09.499
I know, I know. It's just, Jess is trying to put Trey behind her and start a new life.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.754
Great. As long as she doesn't get in the way of yours.

16:23.636 --> 16:24.976
Marissa?

16:24.977 --> 16:26.409
Sandy.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.830
Look, I know it's weird I slept here,

16:29.836 --> 16:32.924
but I just didn't feel like being in the trailer by myself.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.686
If you need somewhere to go, you can always come to our house.

16:35.687 --> 16:38.470
I... I know. You guys are like family.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.047
It's just that these days...

16:41.048 --> 16:43.490
Things are difficult with you and Ryan, I get that.

16:43.491 --> 16:45.004
But you don't belong here.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.055
Okay. Um, I was just leaving anyway.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.709
If you're looking for Matt, he went to L.A. for a meeting.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.836
Well, I'll track him down.

16:53.217 --> 16:54.558
You go home.

16:54.559 --> 16:55.687
Okay.

16:55.736 --> 16:56.828
All right.

17:02.687 --> 17:05.845
Excuse me? Yeah, hi. I'm picking up an order for Roberts.

17:05.846 --> 17:07.815
- Sure, just a second.
- Thanks.

17:10.827 --> 17:12.310
- Guess who?
- Oh, God.

17:12.755 --> 17:13.958
Hi!

17:14.297 --> 17:16.097
Looks like someone got the short straw.

17:16.098 --> 17:17.531
What? No, I ordered pancakes.

17:17.531 --> 17:20.018
No, you drew the short straw.

17:20.492 --> 17:23.867
You know, after the sex when everyone's hungry, but nobody wants to get the takeout,

17:23.867 --> 17:25.705
short straw picks up the food.

17:26.212 --> 17:30.438
Yes! That is exactly what you're seeing happening here.

17:30.439 --> 17:32.255
Total short-straw scenario.

17:32.256 --> 17:37.055
With the hunger, and all the sex we had last night. Yes.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.288
So was last night like totally kinky, or was it like more about tender lovemaking?

17:41.289 --> 17:44.947
You know, smooth jazz, a burning fire, a zebra-skin rug.

17:44.948 --> 17:46.305
We had a very nice time.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.340
Oh, my God. You didn't have sex at all, did you?

17:50.341 --> 17:51.724
Are my pancakes ready yet?

17:51.725 --> 17:54.022
Your lips aren't chapped, there's no love bites on your neck,

17:54.023 --> 17:55.800
your voice isn't at all hoarse from screaming.

17:55.801 --> 17:57.108
Pancakes, right?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.235
Thank you. Good-bye, Taylor.

17:58.236 --> 17:59.034
Summer...

17:59.035 --> 18:01.211
Summer, wait, I can help you!

18:02.199 --> 18:03.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:03.929 --> 18:06.124
Grab a brush, we're in the homestretch.

18:09.649 --> 18:12.759
So I thought maybe I was going to see you last night.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.258
I got tied up, sorry.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.142
What, do you work for the CIA?

18:16.214 --> 18:18.603
Doesn't matter, I, uh... I got distracted for a few days.

18:18.604 --> 18:20.973
But I'm fine now. In fact-- I'm all yours.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.251
Okay. Fine. You're forgiven.

18:24.252 --> 18:27.818
But in exchange for your silence, I demand a dinner.

18:27.822 --> 18:30.187
Okay. Tomorrow night?

18:30.645 --> 18:32.569
Okay, perfect, yeah.

18:55.728 --> 18:57.718
Hey,  it's Summer, leave a message.

18:58.865 --> 19:01.907
So nothing happened. Still, Matt should know better.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.850
But he doesn't. You have to remember that he's not that much older than the boys.

19:05.938 --> 19:10.134
He just needs some advice from the great Sandy Cohen.

19:10.135 --> 19:13.400
Oh, sometimes you overestimate me.

19:13.896 --> 19:15.119
Not possible.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.580
Oh, get a room.

19:16.581 --> 19:18.396
Hey, count your blessings.

19:18.411 --> 19:22.540
Kids with affectionate parents grow up to be better adjusted sexually as adults.

19:22.541 --> 19:26.465
I know, I meant get a room. My room. And do it in front of me.

19:28.620 --> 19:29.841
This Sadie?

19:30.089 --> 19:31.468
It's Jess.

19:33.908 --> 19:35.058
Jess?

19:35.781 --> 19:38.564
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. I can't...

19:39.487 --> 19:40.685
What do you mean?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.885
No, no, no. Stay put, stay put. I'll be right there.

19:53.218 --> 19:56.032
Hey. I thought you weren't going to let this happen to you again.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.346
After this, I'm done.

19:57.347 --> 19:59.114
If I need help, I'll call, okay?

20:03.011 --> 20:04.201
Thanks for coming out.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.055
Yeah, I need to talk about Seth anyway.

20:06.056 --> 20:07.714
So have you talked to him today?

20:08.080 --> 20:10.654
No, I think we're just too embarrassed to face each other.

20:10.655 --> 20:12.720
Either that, or he's treading water till he gets to Brown,

20:12.721 --> 20:16.380
and finds a big pair of pale New England boobs to replace me.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.518
Oh, babe, you just had an off night.

20:18.519 --> 20:19.705
It'll be okay.

20:19.706 --> 20:21.142
Did this ever happen with you and Ryan?

20:21.143 --> 20:22.483
Actually, no.

20:22.484 --> 20:25.336
I mean, we had our problems, that just wasn't one of them.

20:25.337 --> 20:27.779
What about towards the end, when you guys started drifting apart?

20:27.780 --> 20:29.725
Kind of the opposite.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.165
I guess...

20:33.568 --> 20:35.980
...the more emotionally unavailable you are,

20:35.981 --> 20:39.206
the more you end up wanting each other.

20:43.573 --> 20:44.880
What are you looking at?

20:45.581 --> 20:48.376
Nothing. Hey, you think maybe we should get out of here?

20:48.377 --> 20:49.490
Sold.

21:00.037 --> 21:00.939
Did you see him?

21:00.940 --> 21:02.570
Not yet. How many times has he come around?

21:02.571 --> 21:04.868
It started a couple hours ago. He's been calling, too.

21:04.869 --> 21:05.780
And when'd you end it?

21:05.781 --> 21:09.270
Earlier today. I guess I was inspired by our talk last night,

21:09.271 --> 21:13.465
so I called him up, told him I didn't want to see him anymore, and now here I am--

21:13.466 --> 21:16.392
down a boyfriend, up a stalker.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.933
Is that him in the Mustang?

21:19.257 --> 21:20.473
Yep. He's coming in.

21:20.474 --> 21:22.152
Yeah. Just go in the back.

21:26.441 --> 21:27.939
Look, man, she doesn't want to see you.

21:27.940 --> 21:29.312
Who the hell are you, her bodyguard?

21:29.313 --> 21:32.277
No, but I'll kick your ass if you take one step further.

21:38.556 --> 21:39.626
He's gone?

21:39.627 --> 21:42.129
Yeah. I don't think he'll be back.

21:42.906 --> 21:44.537
Are you going to be okay?

21:44.681 --> 21:47.149
I'll be fine. I promise.

21:48.331 --> 21:49.571
You sure?

21:51.342 --> 21:56.763
Ryan, I know you don't believe me, but I really am trying to change.

21:56.978 --> 21:58.518
You don't have to stay.

22:37.865 --> 22:39.059
Morning.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.627
Hey. Scrambled or fried? I made both.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.636
Neither. I should get going.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.225
Coffee would be nice.

22:49.538 --> 22:53.049
Ryan... don't look all awkward like it's the morning after.

22:53.050 --> 22:54.774
It's not like anything happened last night.

22:54.775 --> 22:56.791
Stay, eat.

22:57.424 --> 22:58.812
Let me get rid of this.

23:00.234 --> 23:01.382
Hello?

23:02.117 --> 23:03.288
Trey.

23:03.740 --> 23:05.010
Hi.

23:06.411 --> 23:07.911
Of course I do.

23:09.392 --> 23:10.940
I'd have to think about it.

23:12.095 --> 23:15.503
Look, I got to go. I'm sitting here with your brother.

23:16.117 --> 23:18.657
Sure. Hang on.

23:20.517 --> 23:22.089
Do you want to talk to him?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.651
Now's not a good time.

23:31.795 --> 23:33.335
I'll call you later.

23:41.051 --> 23:42.646
He wants me to come back.

23:42.758 --> 23:44.725
What happened to trying to change your life?

23:44.726 --> 23:46.370
I am trying.

23:46.548 --> 23:48.808
It's just that it's Trey.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.682
It's hard...

23:50.901 --> 23:52.631
especially all by myself.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.261
Well, what about your parents? Where are they?

23:54.262 --> 23:57.815
Well, my dad's in Tokyo on business, and my mom's at the spa,

23:57.816 --> 24:00.349
AKA in bed with her tennis instructor.

24:00.350 --> 24:03.898
So as you can see, I don't have much to distract me...

24:04.410 --> 24:06.256
unless you want to give it a try.

24:09.382 --> 24:11.198
Look, I can't stay here and baby-sit you.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.108
What about your girlfriends at USC?

24:13.654 --> 24:16.129
I guess I could give them a call, see if they want to come down.

24:16.130 --> 24:19.168
Call them, invite them down. Just take a breath.

24:19.367 --> 24:23.060
Ryan, I'll try, but... what if I freak out?

24:23.061 --> 24:24.342
You won't.

24:27.229 --> 24:30.432
Matt, call me back. We've got a lot to discuss.

24:30.433 --> 24:31.433
Everything okay?

24:31.434 --> 24:33.285
Oh, it's just business.

24:33.843 --> 24:37.549
Hey. I heard you aced your Brown interview.

24:38.056 --> 24:40.159
Looks like the stars are aligning for you.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.087
And Summer! Could be another four years together.

24:43.088 --> 24:44.426
Yeah.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.793
Hey, let me ask you a question.

24:46.794 --> 24:49.457
When you were at college with Mom, did it ever...

24:50.002 --> 24:54.256
get sort of stale with the monogamy and the constant being together?

24:54.257 --> 24:56.380
- Your mother was a firecracker.
- Okay.

24:56.381 --> 24:59.366
My buddies used to say if you see that mail truck rocking, don't come a knocking.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.556
So sorry I asked.

25:00.557 --> 25:01.747
Good morning, honey.

25:01.748 --> 25:02.708
Hi, honey.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.048
Have either of you guys seen Ryan?

25:04.049 --> 25:06.971
I just checked the pool house, and it looks like he didn't sleep there last night.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.192
Good morning, everyone.

25:08.193 --> 25:09.914
- Sadie, hello!
- Hi, Sadie.

25:09.915 --> 25:12.609
I brought bagels. Hope you don't mind me crashing your breakfast.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.255
Oh, not at all; let me get you some coffee.

25:14.256 --> 25:15.775
Hey, is Ryan around?

25:23.025 --> 25:24.303
Actually...

25:25.416 --> 25:28.248
You've really got to learn to lie better.

25:28.619 --> 25:30.178
We'll just let you two...

25:31.426 --> 25:33.918
You're a terrible liar, my dear.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.179
So let me guess.

25:38.283 --> 25:42.469
Ryan got some 911 call from that Jess girl, and it required him spending the night.

25:42.470 --> 25:43.880
That has not been confirmed.

25:43.881 --> 25:45.598
You don't have to protect him, Seth.

25:45.599 --> 25:47.861
It's fine, honestly. I'm not jealous.

25:48.116 --> 25:51.744
I'm just not really sure that Ryan and I are right for each other.

25:51.795 --> 25:53.152
Because?

25:53.756 --> 25:56.756
Because he just seems to have a lot of really intense issues.

25:56.757 --> 25:59.895
Yeah, well, intense issues seem to follow Ryan around.

25:59.896 --> 26:02.005
Well, I don't really know if I'm up for that right now.

26:02.006 --> 26:04.292
Well, listen, I think Ryan really likes you,

26:04.293 --> 26:08.284
and I think if you hang in there, you two will eventually settle into a, uh,

26:08.420 --> 26:12.691
super laid-back, boring-ass relationship, but you've got to cut the guy some slack,

26:12.692 --> 26:15.665
because he just got out of a two-year drama-fest with Marissa,

26:15.666 --> 26:18.585
and the one time that he tried to date someone normal,

26:18.826 --> 26:22.355
she turned out to be my dead grandfather's illegitimate daughter,

26:22.356 --> 26:24.272
so you know how that goes.

26:24.273 --> 26:27.287
Right, yeah, of course. Of course I know how that goes.

26:28.978 --> 26:32.378
Do you think you could do me a favor and not tell Ryan that we talked?

26:32.922 --> 26:35.197
I assume you know how to keep a secret.

26:39.104 --> 26:40.723
Nobody's home!

26:41.368 --> 26:42.720
Don't worry, it's just me.

26:42.721 --> 26:44.313
Oh. Hi.

26:44.314 --> 26:47.827
So, listen, I hate to pop in like this, but I am meeting with Ashley and Madison

26:47.828 --> 26:51.844
at school later today to brainstorm for a prom theme. Do you want to come?

26:51.845 --> 26:54.236
Uh, you... you probably don't need me for that.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.862
Summer, are you kidding me?

26:55.863 --> 26:59.524
It's the end of the year. We are all fried. Come on, please?

26:59.687 --> 27:01.292
- Fine.
- Yay!

27:03.231 --> 27:04.416
Here you go.

27:05.131 --> 27:07.322
Do you have to print out a flier for everything?

27:07.323 --> 27:09.802
You'll thank me when you make your 2006 scrapbook.

27:11.233 --> 27:15.133
I mean, there was the party with Bill Meriam, the-the few dates I went on with Maya--

27:15.134 --> 27:16.812
nothing that the board could oust me for.

27:16.813 --> 27:18.048
What about Marissa?

27:18.757 --> 27:19.748
What about Marissa?

27:19.749 --> 27:24.093
I went to your house yesterday to talk to you, and she answered the door in pajamas.

27:24.094 --> 27:26.013
She's going through a tough time. She needed a friend.

27:26.014 --> 27:28.001
Well, then be a friend, but for God's sake, Matt,

27:28.002 --> 27:31.269
do not be throwing pajama parties with 17-year-old girls.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.491
- Nothing happened.
- That doesn't matter.

27:33.492 --> 27:35.813
And right now, the board is watching you, waiting for you to screw up,

27:35.814 --> 27:38.155
and you're screwing up.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.685
This is a witch hunt.

27:39.736 --> 27:42.873
If they want to take me down, they will, unless you stop them.

27:44.071 --> 27:49.835
So please... call Griffin, tell him you're going to keep me on the project.

27:53.027 --> 27:56.007
Ew. School on a Sunday is, like, beyond creepy.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.528
Summer, you're right on time.

27:57.529 --> 27:59.627
Where's, um, Ashley and Madison?

28:01.486 --> 28:02.819
Summer?

28:02.820 --> 28:04.083
Cohen.

28:06.256 --> 28:08.739
You know, you said the AV club was meeting.

28:08.740 --> 28:11.743
I brought A History of Violence.

28:11.744 --> 28:13.635
This is a total ambush.

28:13.636 --> 28:16.725
Look, you two are like my family,

28:16.726 --> 28:20.844
and if I sense there's trouble with my Sethimer, I am going to do what I can to help.

28:20.845 --> 28:22.473
We're not in any trouble--

28:22.601 --> 28:24.651
at least that we've acknowledged to each other.

28:24.652 --> 28:27.818
That is exactly why I brought you here today:

28:27.916 --> 28:29.310
communication...

28:29.311 --> 28:30.623
intimacy.

28:30.624 --> 28:33.312
These are two skills that you two could improve upon.

28:33.313 --> 28:38.953
Now, I am not a licensed sex therapist, but my father was, and before he ran away,

28:38.954 --> 28:42.668
he used to conduct these sessions with real couples in our basement.

28:42.669 --> 28:43.865
That's creepy.

28:43.866 --> 28:47.859
Okay. We're going to start off with touching.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.502
I want you to place your hands anywhere on each other's bodies,

28:51.503 --> 28:53.568
excluding breasts and genitals.

28:53.569 --> 28:54.803
I have to go.

28:54.804 --> 28:58.307
Cohen... put your hands on me now.

28:58.308 --> 29:00.128
Come on, it'll be fun.

29:02.230 --> 29:04.290
Good. Summer?

29:05.680 --> 29:06.848
Good.

29:06.900 --> 29:12.070
Okay, now I want you to concentrate on your eye contact.

29:12.071 --> 29:15.300
Get lost in each other's gaze.

29:15.538 --> 29:19.456
Mm... getting lost... I'm getting lost...

29:19.457 --> 29:24.439
As you gaze into each other's eyes, do you feel stirrings...

29:24.440 --> 29:26.827
deep in your loins?

29:33.362 --> 29:35.151
I don't really feel anything.

29:35.152 --> 29:36.547
- I got nothing.
- Not really.

29:36.548 --> 29:38.913
Not even the faintest spark?

29:39.267 --> 29:40.998
A tiny flicker?

29:40.999 --> 29:42.836
What does that say about us?

29:44.366 --> 29:46.883
Well, I also do breakup counseling.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.795
And for you?

29:50.796 --> 29:52.868
I'll have the same, thank you.

29:54.046 --> 29:57.903
So, I'm sorry that I didn't take you anyplace nicer for our first date.

29:57.904 --> 30:02.159
Are you kidding? This place is the culinary destination of Newport.

30:02.688 --> 30:03.917
Wait till you try the pancakes.

30:03.918 --> 30:04.820
Next time.

30:04.821 --> 30:06.704
- Next time?
- It's a plan.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.278
Yeah, all right. Excuse me.

30:10.512 --> 30:11.748
Jess.

30:12.476 --> 30:14.102
Is this Ryan Atwood?

30:14.103 --> 30:16.195
- Who's this?
- Kim. I'm Jess' friend.

30:16.196 --> 30:17.928
Look, we really need you to come over here.

30:17.929 --> 30:19.629
Wh-Wh-What's going on in the background?

30:19.630 --> 30:22.601
Well, word got out about Jess' tonight, and now half of USC is here.

30:22.602 --> 30:25.546
And supposedly Jim is on his way over here and on a rampage.

30:26.946 --> 30:28.866
All right, well, grab Jess and get out of there.

30:28.867 --> 30:30.255
I would, but she's locked in the pool house.

30:30.256 --> 30:34.676
She's drunk, and she's crying, and she says the only person she'll talk to is you.

30:35.015 --> 30:36.178
Well...

30:40.560 --> 30:42.425
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.

30:45.747 --> 30:47.211
Is everything okay?

30:48.556 --> 30:49.841
Not really.

30:50.763 --> 30:53.860
Okay. You know, if you have to go, Ryan, go.

30:53.861 --> 30:56.441
It's fine, really. I get it.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.100
You do?

30:59.686 --> 31:01.872
No, I don't,

31:01.873 --> 31:05.370
but I get that something is pulling you under, and I get that you can't let it go.

31:05.371 --> 31:10.119
So whatever it is, please, just go deal with it, and find me when you're done.

31:29.667 --> 31:30.825
I'm right here.

31:32.405 --> 31:34.257
I wasn't looking for you.

31:34.749 --> 31:36.300
But I'm here now.

31:36.339 --> 31:39.242
Whatever this game is you're playing, you can stop it.

31:39.243 --> 31:40.490
You don't want me to go away.

31:40.491 --> 31:41.883
Really? What makes you say that?

31:41.884 --> 31:43.237
You're lonely.

31:44.663 --> 31:47.436
Right. Well, thanks for the analysis. I feel much better.

31:47.437 --> 31:51.626
No, look... if you need a break from everything going on in there...

31:52.818 --> 31:53.972
I can help.

31:56.279 --> 31:58.564
I think I'm doing just fine on my own.

32:08.450 --> 32:09.959
- You must be Ryan.
- Kim?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.239
I'm so glad you're here.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.900
She's in there, still won't come out.

32:20.687 --> 32:22.092
Jess!

32:22.139 --> 32:24.107
Jess, it's me, open up.

32:25.587 --> 32:26.833
You came.

32:26.844 --> 32:29.297
Yeah, what is it? What are you so upset about, huh?

32:29.298 --> 32:33.817
I thought that I could have some friends over, and then I started missing you.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.504
Well, let's go outside; they're worried about you.

32:35.505 --> 32:39.202
No, no, no! I don't want to be with my friends.

32:39.203 --> 32:40.641
I want to be in here with you.

32:40.642 --> 32:41.975
Yeah, well, that's not a good idea.

32:41.976 --> 32:44.995
Are you kidding? This is the first good idea I've had.

32:44.996 --> 32:48.429
Jim and Trey, none of those other guys knew how to take care of me.

32:48.489 --> 32:51.274
You know how to take care of me, Ryan.

32:56.637 --> 32:57.852
It's all right.

33:00.274 --> 33:01.543
It's okay.

33:05.922 --> 33:08.629
Jess. Jess. Jess.

33:08.630 --> 33:09.724
Hey!

33:10.029 --> 33:11.573
You moving on already, is that what this is?

33:11.574 --> 33:13.707
If you want to settle this with someone, settle it with me.

33:18.505 --> 33:19.967
You want to talk outside?

33:19.968 --> 33:21.018
Yeah.

33:23.065 --> 33:24.308
Lock the door.

33:35.163 --> 33:36.262
So what, you're seeing her now?

33:36.263 --> 33:37.846
She's just a friend of my brother's.

33:37.847 --> 33:38.991
Not that guy Trey.

33:38.992 --> 33:40.236
- Look...
- What?

33:40.237 --> 33:42.263
You got to take your brother's leftovers?

33:46.915 --> 33:49.527
Now, listen to me. You got to stay away from this girl.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.031
She's trying to start over, you got to let her.

33:51.032 --> 33:53.511
None of your business, man.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.672
You're right.

33:56.654 --> 33:58.262
That's why I'm leaving.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.953
Ryan! Ryan, are you okay?

34:04.954 --> 34:06.164
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:06.165 --> 34:11.505
Look, Jess, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him... and my brother.

34:11.505 --> 34:14.065
Of course, I will, after the way you fought for me.

34:14.067 --> 34:16.484
Look, you got to stop dating guys like him.

34:17.841 --> 34:20.150
And I got to stop dating girls like you.

34:21.043 --> 34:22.606
Take care of yourself.

34:29.255 --> 34:30.129
Hello.

34:30.130 --> 34:33.387
Taylor, I really don't want to talk to you about my sex problems with Summer.

34:33.388 --> 34:38.029
Okay, okay, so the intimacy exercises were a miserable failure,

34:38.030 --> 34:40.186
but I don't think you should lose hope.

34:40.187 --> 34:42.034
Why, do you have some sort of secret cure?

34:42.034 --> 34:43.521
As a matter of fact, I do.

34:43.522 --> 34:45.481
It's called raunchy sex.

34:45.482 --> 34:49.597
Now, now, you don't see me as a sexual being, Seth. I mean, I get that.

34:49.598 --> 34:54.603
But without revealing too much, if sex were a martial art, I would be a black belt.

34:54.605 --> 34:56.077
Weirdly, I'm not surprised.

34:56.078 --> 35:00.386
Now, I would like to talk to you about a little something called the Kama Sutra.

35:00.387 --> 35:01.839
How do you know all this?

35:01.840 --> 35:06.093
Let's just say Dean Hess hid a treasure trove of secrets underneath his pink shirts.

35:06.195 --> 35:07.955
Okay. Position one.

35:07.956 --> 35:11.484
Okay, I really don't want to picture you doing that with the Nazi dean.

35:11.646 --> 35:15.813
Seth, do you want your sparks back with Summer?

35:16.963 --> 35:17.955
Yes.

35:17.956 --> 35:19.550
Then listen and learn.

35:19.781 --> 35:22.570
Okay, this is the yanni, and this is the lingum.

35:22.571 --> 35:24.692
Look, Matt may not have shown the best of judgment,

35:24.693 --> 35:26.747
but it's nothing I'd fire him over.

35:26.748 --> 35:30.336
And the "sacrificing one life to save the many" argument?

35:30.337 --> 35:31.829
I don't get it.

35:31.935 --> 35:36.099
The board loves you, Henry. One phone call from you, nobody has to sacrifice anyone.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.634
What makes you think I would do that?

35:37.635 --> 35:40.565
Business. Our plan is the best one, you know that.

35:40.566 --> 35:42.079
It makes me wonder about the board, though.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.361
That they'd scrap a lucrative project over something like this.

35:45.362 --> 35:48.292
It makes no sense from a business perspective, but...

35:48.293 --> 35:49.883
maybe it's personal.

35:51.872 --> 35:54.716
This is about Maya. Isn't it?

35:55.671 --> 35:58.394
She cried for days over him.

35:58.733 --> 36:00.490
I'm sorry, Henry...

36:02.101 --> 36:03.748
but you didn't have to lie to me.

36:03.749 --> 36:06.653
I'm just a father looking after his daughter.

36:08.685 --> 36:11.336
Reason and logic don't stand a chance.

36:11.851 --> 36:13.448
I understand that.

36:13.449 --> 36:16.847
All different kinds of loyalty, Sandy, I chose mine.

36:16.848 --> 36:18.621
Now you choose yours.

36:18.622 --> 36:19.954
What's it going to be?

36:19.955 --> 36:22.738
Hospital or Matt?

36:30.542 --> 36:32.060
Hey, Coop.

36:32.061 --> 36:33.465
You okay, Summ?

36:33.466 --> 36:35.394
Yeah, just Cohen called.

36:35.395 --> 36:38.377
He's coming over, he wants to talk. It doesn't bode well.

36:38.378 --> 36:40.295
Well, maybe he's coming to patch things up.

36:40.296 --> 36:42.713
Or maybe he's coming over to break up with me.

36:42.714 --> 36:45.315
Anyway, it means that I can't hang out tonight, okay?

36:45.316 --> 36:47.795
Oh, hey, I totally understand.

36:47.947 --> 36:49.713
Just call me later.

36:49.714 --> 36:51.088
Okay.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.320
Hey.

37:04.321 --> 37:06.437
Hey, how'd it go?

37:06.438 --> 37:09.260
Fine. Fine.

37:09.922 --> 37:11.840
Matt called a couple of times.

37:11.841 --> 37:13.688
He sounded nervous.

37:18.006 --> 37:20.252
- Matt?
- Yeah.

37:20.253 --> 37:23.282
I'll let you talk to him. I'm going to go lock up the house.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.941
Oh, hey. I-I didn't know you were here.

37:55.942 --> 37:56.788
Yeah.

37:56.789 --> 37:58.781
Didn't you have a date with Sadie tonight?

37:58.782 --> 38:00.631
Almost, but then...

38:00.632 --> 38:02.165
That girl Jess again?

38:02.166 --> 38:05.901
Yeah, I think I finally learned my lesson, but now it might be too late.

38:06.194 --> 38:07.846
It's never too late.

38:08.526 --> 38:10.305
You just have to talk to her.

38:24.796 --> 38:26.527
Hey, am I interrupting?

38:27.078 --> 38:29.802
Princess Sparkles is here for emotional support,

38:29.803 --> 38:31.710
helping to cushion me before the fall.

38:31.711 --> 38:33.908
Well, you may want to put her in her drawer, 'cause I don't think

38:33.909 --> 38:36.015
she should see what's about to happen.

38:36.079 --> 38:36.982
That bad?

38:36.983 --> 38:40.808
Now, for the next 20 minutes, or 24 hours, if I turn out to be Sting,

38:40.809 --> 38:42.562
you have to keep an open mind.

38:42.563 --> 38:43.597
What are you talking about?

38:43.598 --> 38:48.364
Now, if you'll be so kind as to disrobe, we will begin with the wheelbarrow position.

38:48.365 --> 38:49.763
Oh, my God. Ew.

38:49.764 --> 38:55.200
Now, as it turns out, I have recently been schooled in the art of Tantric sex.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.480
Where, some pervy Internet chat room?

38:57.481 --> 38:59.876
No, no, no. It was very tasteful. Taylor came over...

38:59.877 --> 39:00.978
What?

39:00.979 --> 39:04.944
Taylor, like, came over to your house and gave you one-on-one sex education?

39:04.945 --> 39:06.225
Is that a no to the wheelbarrow?

39:06.226 --> 39:07.753
I'll wheelbarrow you.

39:24.824 --> 39:25.994
Hi.

39:41.340 --> 39:44.015
My brother and I used to play with these when we were little.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.628
Especially when my mom was drinking. We'd...

39:49.817 --> 39:53.297
go in the back bedroom and play cars and...

39:54.405 --> 39:56.343
pretend we didn't hear anything.

40:03.954 --> 40:05.839
He always used to tell me that...

40:05.840 --> 40:09.020
he'd save up and buy us a Camaro one day.

40:09.021 --> 40:11.269
We'd blow town and never come back.

40:13.188 --> 40:17.263
It wasn't going to happen, so... one day, he tried to steal one.

40:18.378 --> 40:19.797
I was there.

40:21.642 --> 40:24.431
Somehow that landed me here and him in Vegas.

40:28.812 --> 40:30.789
Now we don't talk anymore.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.125
And you didn't tell me because...?

40:34.126 --> 40:38.273
I-I guess I'm not used to unloading on people.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.891
Too busy being loaded on, I guess.

40:43.306 --> 40:44.798
I don't know.

40:45.313 --> 40:48.019
But I wanted to start over with you.

40:48.998 --> 40:51.354
You know, I have many talents.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.607
One of them is listening.

40:53.608 --> 40:55.511
You've just got to let me do it.

40:55.512 --> 40:56.856
Deal.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.208
That's not to say we should just be talking.

41:18.277 --> 41:19.608
Whoa.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.938
Yeah, whoa.

41:22.937 --> 41:26.347
You know, it's a good thing I put Princess Sparkle away for that.

41:26.348 --> 41:31.442
To think it was that amazing, and we didn't even get to the wheelbarrow.

41:31.534 --> 41:33.687
You know, we should make a pact.

41:33.688 --> 41:35.953
If we go away to college together,

41:35.954 --> 41:39.277
we should, like, fight, like, every day.

41:39.715 --> 41:42.072
I'm pretty sure I can make that happen.

41:46.995 --> 41:47.909
Sorry.

42:56.310 --> 42:59.907
