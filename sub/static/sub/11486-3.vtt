WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.392
I don't know what he did, Charlie.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.676
The teacher called
and told me to come get him.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.354
I want it on the record
that if the kid was running...

00:08.520 --> 00:11.432
...a blackjack game under bleachers
he didn't get it from me.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.310
What? I said, he didn't.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.675
Well, I can assure you he did not learn
that kind of crass behavior from me.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.319
Maybe I should wait in the hall.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.835
Hold on.
What is he doing here?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.470
Well, my car is in the shop, and Charlie
was nice enough to give me a ride.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.427
No, Charlie was nice enough to call you
a cab, but you wouldn't take it.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.874
So, what's going on?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.996
Your son gave his teacher the bird.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.439
Okay, I want it on the record
that he didn't necessarily...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.709
Charlie, just leave it alone.
What exactly happened?

00:43.880 --> 00:46.678
I was writing on the board
and he thought I couldn't see him.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.074
- Is this true?
- Yeah, I really thought she couldn't see.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.834
I'm afraid this kind of behavior
is grounds for suspension.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.675
- Maybe we can catch a matinee.
- Yeah.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.594
Jake, why did you flip
Miss Pasternak off?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.558
Excuse me. We don't end our sentences
with prepositions.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.553
We say,
"Why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?"

01:08.840 --> 01:11.479
I think that answers your question.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.037
Jake, why did you flip off
Miss Pasternak?

01:18.480 --> 01:20.038
Because she picks on me.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.431
Jake, I don't treat you any differently
than any of the other students.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.989
- Yeah, right.
- Shut up.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.389
You know, I'd like to talk
to your parents alone.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.480
- Come on, Jake.
- What, I don't even get to tell my side?

01:32.640 --> 01:35.916
Buddy, you're 11.
You have no side.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.275
This isn't my fault. I was provoked.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.829
- You were provoked?
- Yeah, it means...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.070
I know what it means.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.118
And it doesn't matter.
What you need to do now is apologize.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.033
- But I'm not sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

01:49.200 --> 01:53.671
Just say it and look it. You've got those
big, cute kid eyes. Use them.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.117
- That would be lying.
- That's your line in the sand?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.635
You muttonhead, you just flipped off
your teacher.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.994
- Yeah, but I was being honest.
- And look where it got you.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.753
I think I just lost my innocence.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.150
He's really a very well-behaved boy...

02:13.320 --> 02:16.039
...but he has had some problems
dealing with our separation.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.512
That's true. Although it wasn't so much
a separation as a kicking out.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.517
I sympathize, but if I gave
special consideration to every child...

02:25.680 --> 02:29.275
...whose parents are going through
divorce, I'd be getting the finger all day.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.476
We're not saying
he shouldn't be punished.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.200
- He certainly should.
- But just let us try to handle it.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.828
By "us" he means me.
I always have to be the bad guy.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.274
You're better at it than me.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.073
Than I.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.794
You are such an ass.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.748
- Can we have a moment, please?
- I think that'd be a good idea.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.310
And it's,
"May we have a moment, please?"

02:55.000 --> 02:56.911
Stop it.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.629
Miss Pasternak.
I'm sorry, we haven't officially met.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.438
- I'm Jake's uncle, Charlie.
- Hello.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.957
And I am really sorry.
This may not be my place...

03:05.120 --> 03:06.951
...and if it's not,
I am really sorry...

03:07.600 --> 03:09.556
...but Jake has something
he wants to say.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.269
I am really sorry.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.953
- And I'm really sorry too.
- Why are you sorry?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.350
The kid may have gotten
the rude gesture from me.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.115
I'm not used to being around children
and, well, I am really sorry.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.513
Well, thank you. I appreciate it,
but it doesn't change what Jake did.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.910
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.672
Jake, go to the vending machine...

03:42.840 --> 03:46.196
...and get Miss Pasternak
a peach Snapple and a bag of Skittles.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.796
It is Miss Pasternak, right?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:22.320 --> 04:25.039
Now, this one's called
"Read Between the Lines."

04:27.880 --> 04:31.714
You're giving the finger,
but you've got plausible deniability.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.791
Cool. Like the Itchy Eye.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.833
Exactly. Now, this one's called
"the Slow Crank."

04:39.000 --> 04:40.479
Charlie.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.113
As you can see, it's effective
but lacks deniability.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.759
- Dad, check it out. Balloon Finger.
- Okay, that's enough.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.679
Do we need to be teaching him
more ways to flip people off?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.190
Flip off people.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.517
Charlie, do you realize how close
he came to being suspended today?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.113
- I do.
- And do you understand...

05:04.280 --> 05:07.033
...how lucky we are Miss Pasternak
decided to give him a chance?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.590
Lucky? Sure, why not.
Let's call it luck.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.754
What does that mean?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.354
It means I'm too modest
to call it skill.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.317
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

05:18.480 --> 05:20.471
How come only one finger
is the bad finger?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.194
I don't know, Jake.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.671
This one's okay, right?

05:25.160 --> 05:26.434
Right.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.998
- Dad.
- What?

05:29.160 --> 05:30.832
Anything?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.714
No.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.669
I don't get it. Who decides?

05:54.120 --> 05:57.749
Uncle Charlie, I had a weird dream.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.956
And it's getting weirder.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.000
Hey, buddy.
Why aren't you asleep?

06:05.160 --> 06:07.196
I'm hoping I am.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.077
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Miss Pasternak.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.675
Listen, buddy, Miss Pasternak and I
are kind of having a sleepover.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.513
Because we're like, you know, friends.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.039
No way.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.035
Jake, I'm only your teacher
from 8: 15 to 3:00.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.395
After that I'm just a person
like anybody else.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.393
This is more wrong than the time
I saw Santa peeing at the mall.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.509
Okay, why don't we wrap up this
after-school special and call it a night.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.638
Don't worry. This won't change
anything between us at school.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.438
So you're still gonna be mean to me?

06:47.720 --> 06:50.029
That's right.
Same old junkyard dog.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.159
- Come on, buddy. Get some sleep.
- Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.396
- Do you think he'll be okay?
- Sure.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.393
He's just not used to seeing his teacher
out of the classroom.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.437
And her pants.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.239
I'll talk to him in the morning
and make sure he's okay...

07:05.400 --> 07:09.188
...and that he keeps this to himself.
- Thank you, Charlie.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.719
Oh, Miss Pasternak.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.836
Why do you never call me
by my first name?

07:17.200 --> 07:20.476
I don't know.
This just seems way hotter.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.310
- Charlie?
- Yes, Miss Pasternak.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.119
Do you think Jake believes
we're just friends?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.556
Why not? We are, right?

07:30.720 --> 07:34.429
I mean, once I get to know you better
I'm pretty sure I'd consider you a friend.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.759
Charlie, we both know
there's much more than friendship...

07:37.920 --> 07:41.276
...going on between you and me.
- Much more?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.714
How much more?

07:42.880 --> 07:46.270
Well, I know this is pretty quick
and I don't wanna use the L word...

07:46.440 --> 07:50.911
- Good. Thank you.
...but this feels an awful lot like love.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.995
I'm sorry, which L word
didn't you want to use?

07:56.760 --> 07:59.115
Oh, Charlie. Come on.

07:59.280 --> 08:04.035
- Let's go to sleep.
- Yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.592
- Morning. What are you doing?
- Morning.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.911
Making my world-famous huevos
rancheros for my brother and nephew.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.550
No kidding. What stupid thing did you do
you're trying to make up for?

08:20.520 --> 08:22.590
Why do you always just assume that...?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.433
I slept with Jake's teacher.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.954
Oh, Charlie, did you learn nothing
from the den-mother fiasco?

08:31.120 --> 08:33.190
It gets worse. The kid found out.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.957
- What about your brother?
- He doesn't know yet.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.467
Oh, hey, you made breakfast.
What's the occasion?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.837
No occasion. Just trying to help out.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.798
Well, thank you. I really appreciate it.
Good morning, Berta.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.997
Morning, you goofy, clueless bastard.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.600
Nice to see her in a pleasant mood
for a change.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.557
Yeah. Sit down.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.350
Have some huevos.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.310
- Fresh-squeezed orange juice.
- You squeezed this?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.835
No, it says it on the can.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.352
Okay, what stupid thing did you do?

09:13.240 --> 09:16.676
Well, funny thing...

09:20.880 --> 09:23.474
I slept with Miss Pasternak.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.717
Charlie, what were you thinking?

09:26.880 --> 09:28.518
What if Jake finds out?

09:28.680 --> 09:30.477
Okay...

09:31.800 --> 09:35.076
Oh, no! Oh, no! How?

09:35.680 --> 09:38.592
- He woke up in the middle of the night...
- You brought her here?

09:38.760 --> 09:41.479
Did you learn nothing
from the den-mother fiasco?

09:42.560 --> 09:45.313
- Hey, I kept him from getting suspended.
- Oh, that's how?

09:45.480 --> 09:48.597
- You're welcome.
- Are you crazy?

09:48.760 --> 09:51.433
No, but I have a sneaking suspicion
Miss Pasternak may be.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.311
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.072
Oh, that makes me feel much better.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.674
So how did Jake take it?
Did he freak out?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.349
Not as much as you.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.988
- Morning.
- See? He's fine.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.675
Jake, do you wanna talk about
what you saw last night...

10:08.840 --> 10:10.910
...with Uncle Charlie
and Miss Pasternak?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.436
Oh, God. That really happened?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.200
Good, Alan. Way to go.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.032
Dad, can I be homeschooled?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.909
Listen, Jake. Don't worry.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.469
You go to school,
don't say anything to anybody.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.837
I'll tell her I can't see her anymore
and we'll forget this happened.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.874
Man, it's like Cub Scouts
all over again.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.398
- I hope you saved room for dessert.
- I saved room for you.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.111
You sure?
Because I'm just empty calories.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.679
How about a nice fruit cup?

10:53.040 --> 10:55.235
Two fruit cups, please.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.149
Listen, Delores. We need to talk.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.679
Oh, call me Miss Pasternak.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.119
No, let's keep this friendly.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.155
Dolores, you're a terrific woman and
I've enjoyed being with you very much...

11:10.720 --> 11:14.395
...but I know deep in my heart
that you can do so much better than me.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.035
- Okay. I understand.
- Good. Thank you.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.393
You're insecure. But don't worry.
I am not going to abandon you.

11:24.480 --> 11:28.268
No, no, no, that's not
what I'm worried about.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.874
See, Delores...

11:32.480 --> 11:33.833
I'm a bad man.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.235
I'm a player.
I go from woman to woman and then...

11:39.400 --> 11:41.709
Charlie, that's the past.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.394
I'm not going to give up on us,
and you wanna know why?

11:44.560 --> 11:46.357
Why?

11:46.520 --> 11:50.433
Because somebody told me
that we belong together.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.792
Really?
It can't be somebody who knows me.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.313
Oh, he knows you very well.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.278
And he loves you even more than I do.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.830
Our union has been ordained, Charlie.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.710
What? Come again?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.871
After we fornicated...

12:12.400 --> 12:15.756
...I prayed for forgiveness
and I was told not to worry about it.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.193
By the same guy?

12:20.360 --> 12:21.873
There's only one guy, Charlie.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.669
And his loving hand has been guiding me
ever since I quit pole dancing in Reno.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.239
No kidding. Which club?

12:28.600 --> 12:32.195
- Did you dress like a schoolteacher?
- It doesn't matter.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.920
What matters is the same hand
that delivered me...

12:35.080 --> 12:37.469
...from my life of degradation
has brought me to you.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.199
For what? More degradation?

12:40.120 --> 12:43.510
No. To help you become a better man.
To achieve your potential.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.477
Now sit up straight
and eat your fruit.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.598
- All right.
- All right, what?

12:52.720 --> 12:55.109
All right, Miss Pasternak.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.675
<i>Hey, Charlie. Guess who.</i>

13:02.840 --> 13:06.355
<i>I know we didn 't make plans for tonight</i>
<i>but we really should get together...</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:09.796
<i>... and talk more about this path</i>
<i>we are on and where it's heading.</i>

13:09.960 --> 13:12.679
<i>We know where it's heading</i>
<i>but it would mean a lot to me...</i>

13:12.840 --> 13:14.831
<i>... to hear the words come out</i>
<i>of your mouth.</i>

13:15.000 --> 13:18.629
<i>Your beautiful, blessed mouth.</i>

13:18.800 --> 13:20.836
<i>Call me, sweetheart.</i>

13:21.360 --> 13:24.193
Boy, it's weird being on the other side
of one of these calls.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.071
I can imagine. Well?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.276
- Professional opinion?
- Please.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.317
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.634
Yeah, I thought so.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.635
I mean, she barely knows you.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.110
Where does she get off
being so forward?

13:42.400 --> 13:46.951
Rose, we had one night together and you
handcuffed yourself to my refrigerator.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.071
That was different.
We were meant to be together.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.718
Okay, I was gonna ask you
the best way to end this...

13:54.880 --> 13:59.237
...but I realize now that breakups
may be outside your area of expertise.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.753
Yeah. I do mate for life.
I'm like a penguin that way.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.873
Plus, I like to slide across the ice
on my belly.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.078
Uncle Charlie, guess what happened
with Miss Pasternak today.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.959
- I'm just about to break up with her.
- Oh, no, don't, don't.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.473
- Why not?
- Look at this.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.757
Hey, you got an A in history.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.833
- Way to go, Jake.
- Look at his answers.

14:29.600 --> 14:34.913
"Abraham Lincoln signed
the Emancipation Proclamation in pen."

14:36.920 --> 14:38.319
For this he got an A?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.869
Everybody got an A.
She was, like, happy all day.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.996
She even gave me back
my fake dog poop.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.199
Charlie, I gave you this poop.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.994
You broke into my house
and left it on my pillow.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.913
Still, you regifted.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.196
And I thought you were a classy guy.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.554
Jake, why don't you go to your room
and do your homework.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.756
She didn't give us any.
First time ever.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.599
I love you, Uncle Charlie.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.554
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.678
Yeah, I think you know
what you have to do.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.151
- Break up with Miss Pasternak, right?
- Hell, no. He's getting A's.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.192
He hasn't gotten an A
since naptime in kindergarten.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.470
- But he's not learning anything.
- Charlie, get your priorities straight.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.915
I'm trying to get him
into a decent middle school.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.548
After he's accepted he can learn
that Sacajawea...

15:41.720 --> 15:45.030
...wasn't "a bag full of jawea."

15:51.440 --> 15:53.874
- Ready for dinner?
- Charlie!

15:54.040 --> 15:55.792
It's so good to see you.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.835
It's okay to see you too.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.837
- Charlie.
- What?

16:06.000 --> 16:11.028
- Gum.
- Oh, sorry.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.438
What a great day I had.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.795
All the kids were so well-behaved.
Even Jake.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.279
- That's nice.
- Can I tell you a little secret?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.908
I never really cared for Jake.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.708
But you said you treated him
like all the other kids.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.393
Well, you have to say that.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.910
So where are we going to dinner?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.313
I hadn't really decided.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.833
You came unprepared?

16:36.120 --> 16:40.033
Charlie, you have so much potential
if only you'd apply yourself.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.955
All right, I gotta tell you.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.109
My weirdness bar for chicks
is pretty high...

16:49.480 --> 16:52.438
...but you are clearing it
in street shoes.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.794
You're mad at me.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.391
- No, no.
- Yes, you are.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.832
- No, no. Not... Not mad.
- Then what's your problem?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.354
Nothing. Forget it.
Let's just have a nice evening.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.511
Oh, Charlie, that is so sweet.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.079
Let's never fight again.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.473
Oh, no. I hate it.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.920
Hey, can I use the restroom?

17:20.079 --> 17:22.913
May I use the restroom?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.911
Oh, right.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.670
- May I?
- You're excused.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.714
Thank you.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.793
Charlie.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.599
Look, I'm really sorry
it didn't work out with Miss Pasternak.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.192
You gotta know,
I went the extra mile to make her happy.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.909
Alan, you know what that means,
and Jake, you'll understand someday.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.075
Oh, come on, guys.
I said I'm sorry.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.600
Okay, she's being really unfair
with all this homework.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.479
You know what I'll do?
I'm gonna complain to the principal.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.471
Maybe you should date the principal.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.991
Very funny.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.434
Is that an option?

18:33.800 --> 18:36.837
Because I would if it would get me
out of writing 2500 words...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.718
...on <i>The Red Badge of Courage.</i>

18:44.360 --> 18:47.193
Man, book reports suck.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.990
- Dad.
- Yeah?

18:51.160 --> 18:54.391
Please keep him away
from my karate teacher.
