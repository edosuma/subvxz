(Phone rings)

00:01.168 --> 00:02.501
Holy shit.

Marty:
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:03.671 --> 00:05.237
<i>There in the fine print,</i>

00:05.273 --> 00:07.139
it clearly states that
if the Gage stock price

00:07.174 --> 00:08.774
<i>reaches $200 per share</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:11.176
<i>before our payday,</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:15.247
we will be on the receiving end
of a $9.2 million bonus.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.882
<i>Holy shit.</i>

00:16.918 --> 00:18.150
Doug: Kelsey said she
made you an offer

00:18.185 --> 00:19.285
<i>to come in-house</i>
<i>for their company.</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:21.553
I am seriously considering it.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.755
Why would you consider that?

00:22.790 --> 00:23.756
Marty has asked me to leave

00:23.791 --> 00:24.924
<i>once the Gage business</i>
<i>is wrapped up.</i>

00:24.959 --> 00:26.458
Doug:
<i>No.</i>

00:26.494 --> 00:27.459
(School bell ringing)
Uh-uh.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.295
Marty:
<i>Come on, let's play, um,</i>

00:29.330 --> 00:31.563
what did I do today
instead of going to school?

00:31.599 --> 00:33.065
Roscoe:
<i>Did your parents know</i>

00:33.100 --> 00:35.801
<i>your every move</i>
<i>when you were my age?</i>

00:35.836 --> 00:37.403
Marty:
<i>Definitely not.</i>

00:37.438 --> 00:39.305
Roscoe:
<i>You did what you wanted.</i>

00:39.340 --> 00:41.140
I want you to be happy.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.241
But you're not happy.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.242
Dad, you're having

00:43.277 --> 00:45.077
another kid.

00:45.112 --> 00:48.247
<i>You don't even acknowledge it.</i>

Marty:
<i>Because 150 years from now,</i>

00:56.324 --> 00:58.457
your company is not going
to be smaller.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.125
No.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.827
It's going to be bigger.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.296
Fucking huge,
am I right, Jeannie?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.365
100% Marty Kaan correct.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.733
Clyde?
Never more correct

01:07.768 --> 01:09.501
than at this very moment.
Douglas.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.003
Oh, hells yeah.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.805
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
You don't run

01:12.840 --> 01:14.640
from competition, no.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.342
You crush it.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.277
You wound it

01:18.312 --> 01:21.280
and intentionally leave it
to be devoured

01:21.315 --> 01:24.049
by hungry demons
from a hideous waking nightmare.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.218
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.355
To die a slow
and horrible death,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.123
watching as its own viscera

01:31.158 --> 01:32.758
is-is torn to shreds

01:32.793 --> 01:35.728
in a rabid feeding frenzy
of hungry jackals.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.664
You-you saw what
we did for Gage Motors.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.833
Well, we're gonna double down for
blah, blah, blah incorporated.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.936
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
fucking blah.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.739
Am I right, gentlemen?

01:49.010 --> 01:50.409
Mr. Kaan,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.712
I am so impressed by...

01:55.483 --> 01:57.082
Now that we're
off the shit list,

01:57.118 --> 01:58.550
we back to big balling, baby.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.353
(Chuckles) Since we
killed it at Gage Motors,

02:01.389 --> 02:03.655
it doesn't even matter
what I say anymore.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.091
Everybody just wants a piece
of that Marty Kaan magic.

02:06.127 --> 02:09.193
So what is this piece
of business?

02:09.229 --> 02:10.562
Who are they?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.631
What's their corporate culture?

02:12.666 --> 02:15.267
Will we land that precious

02:15.302 --> 02:17.669
200k initial consult fee?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.138
(Inhales deeply)

02:19.173 --> 02:22.708
Who fucking cares

02:22.743 --> 02:25.911
about any of it?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.148
Because today,

02:29.183 --> 02:30.883
today is payday, motherfucker.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.419
$2.5 million in fees

02:33.454 --> 02:34.787
and, thanks to Martymar

02:34.822 --> 02:36.655
keeping his pimp hand
seriously strong

02:36.690 --> 02:39.458
and nailing that heretofore
impossible to-hit

02:39.493 --> 02:41.860
Gage Motors
$200 per share stock number,

02:41.896 --> 02:46.398
K and A is picking up an extra
$9.2 million equity piece.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.067
Oh.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.235
It is the holy fucking grail.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.938
The ultimate score.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.907
We are out of the woods

02:54.942 --> 02:56.675
and into the light.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.143
(Elevator bell dings)

03:00.147 --> 03:02.881
And payday, oh, is payback day.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.284
(Groans)

03:06.921 --> 03:09.555
Finally, we get to kick out
these 20-year-old assholes

03:09.590 --> 03:11.090
who've been cluttering up
our office.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.725
Get out! Get the fuck out!

03:13.761 --> 03:16.161
Sue me if you don't like
your lease terms.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.063
Kick fucking rocks.

03:18.099 --> 03:21.100
I think I'm gonna hire
a full-time chef.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.668
Yeah, and a masseuse.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.337
Pick up some associates,
work them to death,

03:25.372 --> 03:28.507
make millions on the backs
of their meager salaries.

03:28.542 --> 03:32.177
Poach some senior talent
from another struggling firm,

03:32.213 --> 03:36.081
grind our enemies and detractors
into a bloody fucking pulp.

03:36.117 --> 03:38.016
In other words,

03:38.052 --> 03:39.818
business as usual.

03:42.857 --> 03:44.656
So I'll show you my boards
and explain what I'm doing

03:44.692 --> 03:46.325
with the discreet coding,
and then we'll incorporate

03:46.360 --> 03:47.593
your "Journeyline"

03:47.628 --> 03:49.061
or whatever you call it.
You know what, I'm actually

03:49.096 --> 03:50.596
the Journeyline guy, so you
don't have to look over there.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.264
I still don't feel
right about it.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.932
Doug, it doesn't matter
what you order for takeout.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.667
Uh, I wish that were true.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.870
See, the thing is,
if we were in New York,

03:57.905 --> 03:58.937
it'd be a no-brainer, right?

03:58.973 --> 04:00.005
Say it with me.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.373
Szechuan.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.042
Easy, but here, the Chinese
takeout lacks a certain...

04:04.078 --> 04:05.043
(Sputters) I don't know.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.512
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:06.547 --> 04:07.613
Yeah, it matters, Clyde.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.780
How does it matter, Doug?

04:08.816 --> 04:09.882
"How does it matter?"

04:09.917 --> 04:11.183
When we look back

04:11.218 --> 04:12.618
on the formation
of this company,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.153
our first bouncing baby app,

04:14.188 --> 04:16.188
we're gonna say, "Hey,
you remember when it all began

04:16.223 --> 04:19.658
and Doug ordered...
mu gu gai pan?"

04:19.692 --> 04:21.192
Which I would never do,
by the way.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.961
I mean, could you even...
Okay, I got to stop you right there.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.863
First, please, shut the fuck up.

04:24.899 --> 04:26.565
Second,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.167
I have to go pick up
my asshole father

04:28.202 --> 04:29.501
at the asshole airport

04:29.537 --> 04:32.804
in fucking asshole
rush hour traffic.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.039
So I am out.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.440
Let's shoot for tomorrow, okay?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.009
Well, I need this to happen,

04:37.044 --> 04:40.012
so I'll be here
unless Marty opens fire on us.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.413
Doug, I trust
your takeout instincts.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.681
Really? Okay.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.083
All right, whatever.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.718
Just tell me
where you land, okay?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.228
I'm huge.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.564
No, you're...

04:58.599 --> 05:00.065
exactly where you should be.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.700
I just open my mouth

05:01.735 --> 05:04.336
and eat everything in my path.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.272
What's up?

05:07.308 --> 05:09.875
Look, I know things
are awkward between us,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.944
and just everything,

05:11.979 --> 05:14.713
but we are taking off in a way

05:14.748 --> 05:16.348
that we haven't ever before.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.950
The company, I mean.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.753
And I really want to stay.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.756
I know my payday will float me
for a while,

05:24.792 --> 05:25.958
but I don't want that.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.993
I want to double down.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.363
I want to stay.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.199
Well, that's not...

05:34.235 --> 05:35.500
I mean, no.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.702
I mean, at least

05:36.737 --> 05:38.270
until I'm a little
less pregnant,

05:38.305 --> 05:41.006
so I could walk into a place

05:41.041 --> 05:42.741
and (chuckles)
have kind of a shot at...

05:42.776 --> 05:44.142
You didn't hear me?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.544
I just, I just said no.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.579
And since when did you saying no

05:47.615 --> 05:49.915
mean no in perpetuity
throughout the universe?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.750
Uh, since I said no
when you asked me the last time,

05:51.785 --> 05:52.751
and I meant it.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.087
You know what, I am

05:55.122 --> 05:57.456
a bloated Hindenburg
full of hormones right now.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.759
So I need you
to fucking hear me, Marty.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.994
Okay?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.662
I need two minutes of you

06:03.697 --> 06:05.497
just hearing me

06:05.532 --> 06:08.934
without you being a complete
and total fucking asshole to me.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.969
Do you think
that's even possible?

06:11.005 --> 06:13.839
For you to stop being
such a fucking asshole

06:13.874 --> 06:16.775
and shaming me
for even being alive?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.144
I g... I don't know.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.947
Two minutes, let's see. Go.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.249
No! No. I just...

06:24.285 --> 06:26.184
I just said you have to stop

06:26.220 --> 06:28.153
being such
a motherfucking asshole,

06:28.188 --> 06:30.389
and you're still being
a motherfucking asshole.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.957
Will you calm down?
Can you please,

06:31.992 --> 06:33.525
please, just stop?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.560
I'm trying, Jeannie!

06:36.563 --> 06:39.164
Okay, this is me trying
right now.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.802
Fuck.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.840
(Sighs heavily)

06:49.843 --> 06:51.543
(Sniffles)

06:51.578 --> 06:53.979
Okay. (Clears throat)

06:54.014 --> 06:56.148
(Sighs)

06:56.183 --> 06:58.350
Great.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.218
(Chuckles)

07:00.254 --> 07:02.587
Now...

07:04.124 --> 07:05.590
have you forgotten

07:05.626 --> 07:08.026
that I am a 50% shareholder
in this company?

07:08.062 --> 07:09.928
No. Not at all.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.130
Have you forgotten that
you sent me to fucking prison?

07:12.166 --> 07:14.199
Oh, wow, you're a child.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.367
How long was that?

07:15.402 --> 07:17.069
Oh, it was three seconds.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.237
You know, at what point

07:19.273 --> 07:22.274
have I said enough our fathers
to repent for that?

07:22.309 --> 07:25.744
I made a drastically terrible

07:25.779 --> 07:27.713
and virtually
unforgivable mistake.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.880
(Laughs)

07:28.916 --> 07:30.582
Virtually, huh?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.017
Fuck off, Marty.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.686
You cry loyalty and betrayal
whenever it suits you,

07:34.722 --> 07:37.823
but I have seen you do a lot
of unforgivable shit yourself.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.824
(Scoffs)
Guess what?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.325
The people that I've done it to

07:40.361 --> 07:42.227
still haven't forgiven me.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.163
Okay.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.639
If you don't want to work
next to me,

07:46.667 --> 07:47.933
then maybe I'll buy you out.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.735
(Laughs)

07:49.770 --> 07:51.903
You're gonna buy me out?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.373
Of Kaan and Associates?

07:57.411 --> 07:59.678
Doug:
Hey-oh!

07:59.713 --> 08:01.046
Sorry to interrupt.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.681
I... oy.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.584
Very heavy in here.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.052
Ah, it feels...

08:07.087 --> 08:08.587
Well, I'm not sure.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.122
It's like pain and anger,

08:10.157 --> 08:11.823
both maybe, but sadness, too.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.792
Jesus Christ, Doug.
Go ahead, Doug, what?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.361
Yeah. I just wanted to say
that the wire transfer from Gage

08:16.397 --> 08:18.697
is gonna be in
by end of bid-ness, baby.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.466
Yow. And then we're
gonna be rolling in it.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.801
Am I right? What is...

08:22.836 --> 08:24.136
Oh. You want me
in or out?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.651
Just out. Yeah, stay on it.
Out, okay.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.139
I'm on it.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.807
I'm not leaving, Marty.

08:30.411 --> 08:32.778
You're gonna have
to serve me papers,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.279
and that won't mean
a fucking thing,

08:34.313 --> 08:37.582
because I'm a 50% shareholder
and you're a felon.

08:41.155 --> 08:42.888
(Door opens)

08:46.827 --> 08:48.560
(Meows)
Clyde: Really?

08:48.595 --> 08:49.761
A fucking...

08:49.797 --> 08:51.663
Let's watch the lip there,
buddy, okay?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.665
Yeah, well,
you know that I'm allergic.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.467
No, as a matter of fact,
I didn't know that.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.837
Because you haven't let me see
you over the past two years.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.639
Well, I was also allergic
two years ago, dad.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.773
How about that?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.208
Look, she's a service cat,
all right.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.343
She gives me a lot of comfort service...

09:05.379 --> 09:07.212
(Sneezes)
(Meowing)

09:07.247 --> 09:08.547
(Groans)

09:08.582 --> 09:09.848
You know, that stuff
is all in the mind.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.916
Have you read Sarno?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.784
That's about back pain, dad.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.352
Also all in the mind.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.155
Okay, you know what, I got a
real intense work week coming up

09:17.191 --> 09:18.757
and my place is not that big,
so what do you say

09:18.792 --> 09:19.991
I put you up somewhere?
That sound good?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.693
Seriously? Seriously?

09:21.728 --> 09:22.928
After everything
our family's endured

09:22.963 --> 09:24.496
you're gonna
put me up someplace?

09:24.531 --> 09:25.530
That's just great.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.699
Oh, my God,
are we there already?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.267
Because that was fast.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.602
That might've been the
fewest moves you've ever taken

09:30.637 --> 09:32.270
to get to the holocaust
in your entire life.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.438
Yet here we are.

09:33.474 --> 09:34.773
There we go, the holocaust.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.508
Mr. Holocaust Jokester.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.943
That's so very amusing.
Can we just

09:37.978 --> 09:39.878
press pause on the holocaust
for maybe 30 seconds?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.646
Is that okay?
I wish.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.415
All I'm saying
is there's probably

09:43.450 --> 09:44.816
a win-win out there, huh?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.451
A nice cat-friendly hotel.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.619
We'll get some breakfast.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.821
A hotel, yeah, that'd be great.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.858
I'm gonna drop dead

09:52.893 --> 09:54.793
in some Gomorrah flophouse.
Terrific.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.027
What are you talking about?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.196
Stage four pancreatic, wise ass.

09:58.232 --> 10:00.699
Weeks, not months.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.369
So I'm most likely not gonna be
putting you out for too long.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.872
(Cat meows)

10:06.907 --> 10:08.740
Ellis, Marty.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.876
Uh, I'm starting to think
you're avoiding me.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.479
Listen, it is definitely
end of business, and somehow

10:14.515 --> 10:15.947
this wire transfer has yet to,

10:15.983 --> 10:17.415
uh, find its way
into our account.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.851
Now, I'm sure it's just
a clerical error,

10:19.887 --> 10:21.853
but, uh, you know K and A
needs that money,

10:21.889 --> 10:24.089
so give me a call.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.791
My man.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.159
You finally gonna start
paying rent?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.861
Ah, no.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.163
I found these in Roscoe's room.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.166
Bullshit.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.701
Oh, you think I'm walking around
with G-rolls like this?

10:36.737 --> 10:37.869
How much is this?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.137
That's ten K.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.438
This is a roll of five K.

10:40.474 --> 10:44.075
You know, there's about
two grand, loose,

10:44.111 --> 10:46.011
still in his drawer.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.279
What the fuck are you doing
going through Roscoe's shit?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.847
Hey, I know the kind of stuff

10:48.882 --> 10:50.448
that we were doing at his age,

10:50.484 --> 10:52.250
so I'm just looking out
for the little man.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.186
Don't spend it all
in one place, bro.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.056
Kelsey:
<i>So you just</i>

10:58.091 --> 11:00.125
click on the doctor's name,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.627
and you get a bio
and pic instantly.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.795
That's great.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.463
Look at that,
and some little fun facts.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.598
I love that.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.233
Look at this guy, a Harvard man.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.268
(Chuckles)
Simpatico.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.038
'Cause I went there.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.472
To Harvard.
Yeah, I-I know.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.707
Oh, no, I wasn't saying,
I didn't meant that, uh...

11:15.742 --> 11:16.808
You-you don't have
to try so hard.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.209
I already like you.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.114
(Cat meowing)
Oh, my God.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.217
Did the cat just...

11:26.253 --> 11:28.186
Look, she gets nervous,
that's all.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.421
It's okay.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.222
I'm sorry that you have
to go through...

11:31.258 --> 11:33.091
Yeah, well, you know,
I was thinking that you and I

11:33.126 --> 11:35.060
could spend some time together,
you know what I mean?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.329
I mean, I'm probably gonna be
checking out for good

11:37.364 --> 11:39.598
in a month, maybe two tops.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.500
(Sighs)
No more goddamn chemo for me.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.135
Oh, it smells so bad.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.670
Oh, I might throw up.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.772
I'm sorry, dad, I'm trying,
but I'm gonna throw up.

11:50.677 --> 11:51.977
(Wind pulsates)

11:52.012 --> 11:53.244
Look, could you...

11:53.280 --> 11:55.246
It keeps going
whomp-whomp-whomp, you know?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.815
I just can't take it.
Well, just put yours down

11:56.850 --> 11:58.016
a little bit.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.517
(Pulsating stops)

12:01.355 --> 12:03.822
Okay, don't worry about it, dad.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.091
(Pulsating resumes)
We're good.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.126
Now it's just going
whomp-whomp-whomp on this side.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.227
Put yours up.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.595
You just told me--
put it down.

12:10.631 --> 12:12.263
I made a mistake, you can
put it up now, I apologize.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.932
Up, down, up and down.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.500
Jesus, what do you want?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.769
(Window closes, pulsating stops)

12:19.000 --> 12:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:26.380 --> 12:28.980
You're really gonna smoke
a pipe in my car right now?

12:29.016 --> 12:30.482
I'm packing it.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.484
You see me smoking?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.319
I'm packing the pipe.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.657
So in addition to phase
one beta interactivity,

12:38.692 --> 12:40.992
we'll tease out phase
two for the geeks.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.994
Oh, that's awesome.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.329
Check that out--
as a geek,

12:44.364 --> 12:45.997
I can tell you
that geeks will love that.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.499
Oh, I know, right?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.834
- Yeah. - You have to put in pieces
that are geek specific

12:49.870 --> 12:51.169
so you grab the early adopters.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.437
Smart, yeah.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.774
Oh.
(Keyboard clacking)

12:55.809 --> 12:57.108
What's that?

12:57.144 --> 12:58.443
Hold on, I don't get it.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.544
Oh, is it too geeky?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.212
Yeah, maybe.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.547
Even for me.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.516
Uh, okay, well...

13:04.551 --> 13:07.552
I think maybe if I just
adjust the image a little,

13:07.587 --> 13:09.454
make it a little more like...

13:09.489 --> 13:10.789
this?

13:10.824 --> 13:11.790
Perfect.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.458
That's...
that's awesome.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
I love that.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.495
(Keyboard clacking)

13:20.133 --> 13:22.133
Do you like it when a
girl licks your ass?

13:25.505 --> 13:28.473
(High-pitched):
Um...

13:28.508 --> 13:30.642
Uh...

13:32.746 --> 13:34.145
Oh, God.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.754
(Grunting)

13:42.789 --> 13:44.389
Ellis, it's your old
prison buddy, Marty Kaan, again.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.745
(Door opens)
Okay? Give me a call.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.194
(Door closes)

13:49.229 --> 13:50.662
Oh, hey, dad.
Hey, man.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.239
You selling drugs?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.574
Bags.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.709
I don't care how you're
selling them, okay?

14:04.745 --> 14:06.544
No, dad, bags.

14:06.580 --> 14:07.912
Handbags.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.216
Purses.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.550
Oh, God.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.520
(Panting)

14:15.555 --> 14:17.555
Wow.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.599
Whew.
Yeah.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.602
Awesome.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.604
Yeah.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.938
Uh-huh.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.608
That was...
(Keyboard clacking)

14:36.643 --> 14:37.776
I mean, that was incredible.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.478
It was...
it was magical.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.816
Did you want to...
talk about it, or...?

14:44.851 --> 14:45.817
I'm good.
Good.

14:45.852 --> 14:46.818
Great. Yeah, me, too.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.153
Cool.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.388
Do you want to talk
about the fee structures?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.389
Hmm?

14:51.424 --> 14:52.457
Yeah, oh, my God, that's crazy.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.392
I was just about to say,
"Do you want to talk

14:54.427 --> 14:55.727
about fee
structures?"

14:55.762 --> 14:58.730
It's pretty funny we're
f-finishing each other's...

14:58.765 --> 15:00.064
sentences.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.566
That's funny.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.236
Yeah, so, hey, uh, why don't
I get some, uh, miso soup?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.238
And a little more sake?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.073
And...

15:09.109 --> 15:10.575
get back to work?
(Chuckles)

15:10.610 --> 15:11.776
Okay.
Okay.

15:11.812 --> 15:12.777
Cool.

15:12.813 --> 15:14.145
(Mumbles)

15:17.150 --> 15:19.350
Whew.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.826
Purses?

15:27.861 --> 15:29.327
Well, bags.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.695
I just hate
the word "purses."

15:30.730 --> 15:31.863
Where are you getting them?

15:31.898 --> 15:32.931
Santee Alley.

15:32.966 --> 15:33.998
Like, ten blocks away.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.500
And you're making
this kind of bank?

15:35.535 --> 15:36.868
It's huge.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.037
Is it illegal?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.381
Uh, I mean, the bags
are knockoffs, but...

15:43.410 --> 15:46.044
Do the people that you're
selling them to know that?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.114
Whose idea was it?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.482
Mine.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.486
Huh.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.121
Okay, well, you're
gonna stop it.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.457
Okay.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.992
Roscoe, Roscoe.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.627
I'm not playing
with you, man, okay?

16:02.662 --> 16:03.828
I'm on probation.

16:03.864 --> 16:05.129
How long was that?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.065
What?
Till you made it about you.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.833
Oh, no, sorry.

16:08.869 --> 16:11.536
- What? - You do not get to do
that with this, all right?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.371
This is an illegal
thing that you're doing.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.641
And I know you've learned a
handy tool from your grandpa

16:16.676 --> 16:18.309
about how to turn the
tables on an argument,

16:18.345 --> 16:19.978
and you're using my big
fat reservoir of guilt

16:20.013 --> 16:22.013
about getting sent
to prison, but no.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.181
Nuh-uh.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.349
Not with this thing.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.817
You're gonna stop
selling the bags.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.020
And I won't make you
give all the money back.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.989
But I'm keeping this.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.024
Hey, a good consultant
always takes a fee.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.392
Dad.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.160
(Laughs)

16:36.196 --> 16:37.196
(Imitating Roscoe):
"Dad."

16:37.197 --> 16:38.529
I'm kidding.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.699
And that's a good
instinct, actually.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.369
I mean, you saw a nice
piece of business,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.671
you took advantage
of it-- not bad.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.673
But you're gonna give
it a rest, right?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.241
I will.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.610
All right, get out
of here, Rockefeller.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.614
Purses.

16:56.650 --> 16:57.882
Bags.

16:57.918 --> 16:59.751
Bags.
Bags.

17:05.090 --> 17:06.257
(Phone beeps)

17:06.292 --> 17:09.260
(Line ringing)

17:09.296 --> 17:10.627
(Clears throat)

17:12.299 --> 17:13.731
Automated voice:
The mailbox is full

17:13.767 --> 17:15.733
and cannot accept
any messages at this time...

17:15.769 --> 17:17.101
Son of a bitch.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.205
(Line ringing)

17:22.242 --> 17:24.208
Marty.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.743
Are you gonna start
Facebook stalking me next?

17:29.916 --> 17:31.683
Hello?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.484
Yeah, I think you know I'm here.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.553
Yeah, you want
that big ol' payday.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.587
Yeah, I do.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.622
I'd want it, too.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.856
Okay.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.325
I would feel like
my very life depended on it,

17:40.360 --> 17:41.793
but it doesn't.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.462
Can you please just tell me
when the money is coming, Ellis?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.130
Gage put K and A back
on the map,

17:46.166 --> 17:47.727
that should be more
than enough payment.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.502
I really hope
you're joking around, man,

17:51.538 --> 17:54.105
because we're in a deep fucking
hole, and you know that.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.841
Thanks in part to you, Marty,
our pockets are deep.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.509
It would take a titan to be able

17:58.545 --> 18:00.511
to afford
to challenge us legally.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.647
I'm pretty sure
you're not that titan.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.316
Thanks to me,
your company is hot again.

18:05.352 --> 18:08.653
And you can use that to book
all the business you need.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.154
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.956
Heard you landed
the Wasserman account.

18:11.992 --> 18:13.858
You're welcome.

18:15.729 --> 18:17.128
El-Ellis?

18:17.163 --> 18:18.796
(Phone beeps)

18:18.832 --> 18:20.832
You motherfucker.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.110
Monica: Phil, I think that's...
that's perfect.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.112
Ellis: Yeah.
Monica: I love it, I do.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.446
Marty, we were just
talking about you.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.448
All good things, really.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.250
(Gasps)
Oh, my God, it's Shamu.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.252
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.587
Jesus Christ.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.062
Should have saw
this one coming, huh?

18:44.090 --> 18:46.591
And yet you didn't,
you dumbshit.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.326
Oh, look, they brought counsel.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.327
Scary.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.361
Doug:
Hey, you owe us money!

18:50.397 --> 18:51.863
And we want it, all of us!

18:51.898 --> 18:53.197
Doug.
We all want it.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.932
That money that you owe us.
Doug, Doug.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.367
How do you make it
through the day?

18:56.403 --> 18:58.036
Listen, Ellis.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.504
We get it, okay?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.939
You're the big dog
with the big company

19:01.975 --> 19:02.907
and the penis-shaped car.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.442
(Scoffs)
S-so here we all are

19:04.477 --> 19:06.677
confirming how big
and powerful you are

19:06.713 --> 19:08.279
by coming all the way
to your offices

19:08.314 --> 19:09.547
to make our special plea.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.882
I got it.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.517
You need to step up and
pay us the money, bitch.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.585
You see?
(Scoffs)

19:14.621 --> 19:16.187
She's verbally abusive.
And physically.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.221
Come on.
Monica: Listen, peons,

19:17.257 --> 19:18.389
Ellis Hightower,

19:18.425 --> 19:19.891
Dante Valerio and Gage Motors

19:19.926 --> 19:22.760
could out-litigate Jesus
Christ if they wanted to.

19:22.796 --> 19:24.262
But you're not gonna try
that, are you, Marty?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.596
Who the fuck are you right now?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.931
Ah, so sad.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.933
You just came up here hoping
an emotional plea

19:28.968 --> 19:31.936
over your salad-tossing days
in the can would sway Ellis.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.271
(Clicking tongue)

19:33.306 --> 19:35.406
You got me.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.108
Yeah, I got you, and I got you.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.410
And I got you, and I got you.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.245
Yeah, everyone gets me.

19:42.916 --> 19:46.451
So our friendship-- that just
means nothing to you?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.452
Ugh.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.727
Ellis: That's super
funny, dude.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.720
Are you talking
about the friendship

19:49.756 --> 19:50.755
you cynically manufactured

19:50.790 --> 19:53.091
while I was especially
vulnerable in prison

19:53.126 --> 19:54.592
to get my business?
Ugh.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.928
I don't know what level
of hell you're residing in

19:56.963 --> 19:58.663
that you think
you can fuck me over

19:58.698 --> 20:00.164
in this particular way, Monica.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.166
Oh, really?
Really.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.269
This is nice.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.604
(Scoffs)

20:06.639 --> 20:08.272
Never heard that.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.942
Shouldn't we just make
this a conjugal visit?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.276
Since we...
Ma'am.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.945
Keep your hands in plain view.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.113
Jesus.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.447
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

20:16.483 --> 20:19.117
I'm just trying to give the guy
a little mercy handjob.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.451
Hey, Monica.
Marty.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.519
What's up?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.687
I should just get
right to the point

20:22.722 --> 20:24.989
because you have things to do.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.324
Showering.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.326
Breaking big rocks
into smaller rocks.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.027
Getting ass-raped.
Mo, mo.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.462
Yeah.
What?

20:31.498 --> 20:34.799
Well, I was thinking I would
do something with Roscoe.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.135
I think I'm gonna take him
to New York for Fashion Week,

20:37.170 --> 20:38.850
and then Ibiza for my
friend Timmy's party.

20:38.872 --> 20:40.304
(Laughing):
Are you fucking crazy?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.706
Timmy loves the transgenders.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.774
Oh.
And he will get a kick out of Roscoe.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.710
He'll get a kick out of him?
Totes.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.879
Well, he's got school, okay?
So there's that.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.548
Okay, so he writes a report
about it or something.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.517
A report about rolling
on e with his mom?

20:52.552 --> 20:54.153
Just 'cause you're in
prison doesn't mean

20:54.154 --> 20:55.786
you have to go
all Mr. Morality.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.787
You know what, mo?

20:56.823 --> 20:58.122
Uh, we're good, okay?

20:58.158 --> 20:59.123
Pop's got it covered.

20:59.159 --> 21:01.392
Okay.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.362
So I'll just take him to
Fashion Week, and then...

21:04.397 --> 21:05.696
Are you...
You can't...? No, no.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.698
No Fashion Week, no Ibiza.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.735
How about taking him to get
a fucking frappuccino, okay?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.069
Or-or see a movie,
you know,

21:12.105 --> 21:14.472
something that a normal mom
would do with their son?

21:14.507 --> 21:15.640
Well, that's not
really my style.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.742
Right, because you're
an addict and a sociopath

21:17.777 --> 21:19.777
and a fucking unfit parent.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.981
Says the convicted felon.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.349
Why are you here?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.018
Why don't you just
get the fuck out?

21:27.053 --> 21:28.186
Do you even know him?

21:28.221 --> 21:30.188
He loves fashion.

21:30.223 --> 21:33.191
And he would love
Ibiza, actually.

21:33.226 --> 21:36.194
And maybe, just maybe, it
would help get his mind

21:36.229 --> 21:39.063
off of the fact that his
father is in fucking prison.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.731
Okay, I'm done, I'm ready to go.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.366
No, he's not.
Yeah.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.035
I'd rather be in my locked cell
than stuck here

21:44.070 --> 21:45.369
with this crazy bitch.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.604
You know what?
Fine, Marty.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.939
Fine.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.014
But the next olive branch
goes straight up your ass.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.776
Fuck you.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.010
Clyde: How about this?
How about

21:53.046 --> 21:54.879
we sit down and actually
talk this shit through?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.180
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:56.216 --> 21:57.215
Nah, this is how we'll do it.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.750
This? This is your
brilliant consultation?

21:59.786 --> 22:01.886
How to save $11 million
right off the top.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.554
Don't pay for work

22:03.590 --> 22:04.956
that you signed
a contract to recei...

22:04.991 --> 22:06.757
Holy shit, the noise.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.759
It's like a wild
parrot, it's just,

22:08.795 --> 22:09.927
"Squawk, squawk."

22:09.963 --> 22:11.762
You are a psychopath.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.098
And you have no goddamn
business telling me

22:14.133 --> 22:15.733
I'm on shaky legal ground
after you defrauded...

22:15.768 --> 22:17.702
You need to shut
your fucking mouth.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.404
Or what? What's
mommy gonna do?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.440
You gonna bring the
abortion with you?

22:22.475 --> 22:24.642
Or are you just gonna
leave it with a nanny?

22:24.677 --> 22:26.210
Come on, Jeannie, let's...
let's just go.

22:26.246 --> 22:27.712
(Growls)

22:27.747 --> 22:29.080
(Chuckles)
Bye.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.550
Oh! Oh...!
Oh, shit!

22:32.585 --> 22:35.219
Ow, my hand.

22:35.255 --> 22:36.554
Uh...
Ow.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.822
Oh, my hand.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.257
(Monica groans)

22:39.292 --> 22:40.258
Oh, my...

22:40.293 --> 22:41.826
Oh, my God, you broke my nose.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.995
Why am I so turned on right now?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.296
Me, too.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.164
Bitch!
Marty, let's go.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.769
Monica: Oh, my God,
you broke my nose, you bitch!

22:51.804 --> 22:53.704
I'm actually scared
of you right now.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.039
Good.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.907
Monica:
Oh, God.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.810
Marty: Oh, we're gonna make
these motherfuckers bleed.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.145
You said "we."

23:01.180 --> 23:02.813
I did?

23:02.849 --> 23:05.149
I didn't hear that.
