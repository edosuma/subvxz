00:43.706 --> 00:45.415
Punch out.

00:45.625 --> 00:49.836
Neutral corner.
One, two, three, four, five.

00:50.046 --> 00:53.257
- All right, all right, let's go.
- You got him, champ.

00:53.466 --> 00:55.592
Let's go.

01:05.436 --> 01:07.646
Get him again, yeah.

01:07.855 --> 01:11.108
Break. Take him to his corner.

01:18.574 --> 01:20.158
The champ is really awesome.

01:20.368 --> 01:23.120
No one has even lasted five rounds
in his last eight fights.

01:23.329 --> 01:26.581
- He's definitely The Eliminator.
- Watch this, kid.

01:26.791 --> 01:28.166
He's going down this round.

01:29.794 --> 01:31.461
You can do it, champ.

01:31.671 --> 01:33.422
Let's fight.

01:45.184 --> 01:47.060
Yeah, that's it.

01:50.648 --> 01:53.275
That's it. It's over.

01:58.156 --> 02:01.783
The winner
in 38 seconds of the fourth round...

02:01.993 --> 02:05.245
...and still heavyweight champion
of the world:

02:05.455 --> 02:09.166
Eric "The Eliminator" Sloane.

02:12.003 --> 02:13.920
Turn around.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.381
- Eric, come on over here.
- Champ, come over here.

02:16.591 --> 02:18.800
Champ, how come
you don't use a trainer anymore?

02:19.010 --> 02:22.304
I got my kid brother in my corner for
now. He says he's gonna be a vet.

02:22.513 --> 02:25.515
I say he's gonna be a lawyer
or I'm gonna kick his butt.

02:25.725 --> 02:28.643
Now that you've beaten
everyone there is to beat, what's next?

02:28.853 --> 02:31.104
Take on the world's best.
Show them who's boss.

02:31.314 --> 02:32.981
- What about Thailand?
- What about it?

02:33.191 --> 02:36.401
I understand kickboxing was invented
there and they're the best at it.

02:36.611 --> 02:40.697
Oh, really?
Kid, book us a flight to Taiwan first.

02:41.449 --> 02:44.242
- Bangkok.
- Bangkok, Taiwan, Tokyo.

02:44.452 --> 02:47.120
Hey, what's the difference?
I'm kicking ass wherever I go.

05:20.024 --> 05:21.066
See you, kid.

05:21.234 --> 05:24.110
Just don't forget,
you're fighting their champ next week.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.697
- I know. I'm ready, don't worry.
- Watch your wallet.

05:27.907 --> 05:31.451
She doesn't want my wallet.
She wants to make it with the champ.

05:39.794 --> 05:44.381
You sure had it easy with Mom
in Europe. Dad never let up.

05:44.590 --> 05:48.969
If I wasn't the best in every sport
I played, he'd call me a loser.

05:49.345 --> 05:53.765
He was always on my case,
but he made me strong.

05:55.393 --> 05:59.563
You know, Eric,
Mom, she was a very special lady too.

05:59.772 --> 06:01.815
She wanted me to learn
three languages.

06:01.983 --> 06:05.235
To take ballet
before I learned karate.

06:06.904 --> 06:08.405
I really miss her.

06:10.032 --> 06:13.451
I wish they would have been there
to see me win the championship.

06:14.203 --> 06:16.955
Well, big brother,
they could never get along.

06:17.164 --> 06:21.585
But I'm glad we do. They'd be proud.

06:22.044 --> 06:25.547
Yeah. You're right, kid.

06:26.132 --> 06:28.425
Kurt, come on.

06:47.486 --> 06:49.154
Damn it, kid.

06:49.363 --> 06:51.114
How many times do I have to tell you?

06:51.282 --> 06:53.283
You don't win fights
with that tip-tap shit.

06:53.451 --> 06:55.785
Power. Power kicks.

06:55.995 --> 06:59.914
Now, take your gloves off
and let's go hit the pads. Come on.

07:12.428 --> 07:13.845
That's power, kid.

07:17.892 --> 07:20.393
Whoa, take it easy.

07:21.395 --> 07:24.981
Gotta learn, kid. Come on.

07:37.411 --> 07:41.331
- Hi, welcome to Bangkok.
- Thanks.

07:41.540 --> 07:46.294
Mr. Sloane, how do you feel
about fighting our champ, Tong Po?

07:46.504 --> 07:47.545
Piece of cake.

07:47.713 --> 07:51.508
Mr. Sloane.
You think you're gonna win this time?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.751
Where's the goddamn ice
in this dump?

08:26.961 --> 08:29.713
- Go get me some, huh?
- Okay.

08:31.257 --> 08:33.549
Hey, how much time we got?

08:34.217 --> 08:37.178
About 30 minutes.

08:38.264 --> 08:42.058
Eric, you've never fought
this style before. It's so different.

08:42.268 --> 08:46.187
Hey, a punch is a punch.
A kick's a kick. We came to fight.

08:46.397 --> 08:49.107
Get me some ice, will you? Let's go.

09:52.797 --> 09:54.255
- Eric.
- Where the hell you been?

09:54.465 --> 09:56.174
Give me the ice.

10:02.848 --> 10:04.474
Eric, don't do it.

10:04.642 --> 10:08.561
I saw the look in his eyes.
This guy's crazy. He's fucking crazy.

10:08.771 --> 10:12.315
Good, the crowd will love it.
Just like Rocco in Atlanta.

10:12.525 --> 10:15.568
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand, kid.

10:15.778 --> 10:16.861
I'm the best.

10:17.071 --> 10:19.531
This is just another chance
for me to prove it.

10:19.740 --> 10:22.242
So watch and learn.
It's all in the legs.

10:22.451 --> 10:24.536
In the legs. Legs.

10:24.745 --> 10:28.331
This guy was kicking one of these
with his fucking legs.

10:28.541 --> 10:30.667
And the plaster was falling down.

10:30.876 --> 10:34.420
So what? Can he move like me?

10:36.966 --> 10:39.551
No. We got him.

10:41.554 --> 10:45.390
Eric, please. Don't do this one.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.

10:45.599 --> 10:47.058
- Hey, hey.
- Trust me.

10:47.268 --> 10:50.812
- Don't fight this guy. Trust me.
- Hey, hey.

10:51.021 --> 10:53.898
I brought you here to work my corner.
Now, what's your problem?

10:54.108 --> 10:56.860
You're either with me,
or go the fuck home.

11:03.325 --> 11:04.868
Hey.

11:05.953 --> 11:07.620
We're family.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.415
Let's kick some ass. Come on.

11:15.337 --> 11:16.963
Okay, let's go, champ.

12:41.757 --> 12:43.675
Eric.

13:10.828 --> 13:11.953
No.

13:45.738 --> 13:49.282
- Fucking music's driving me crazy.
- Let's forget about the music right now.

13:49.491 --> 13:52.243
Did you see that?
He caught me with an elbow.

13:52.453 --> 13:55.121
That's the way they fight here.
I told you.

13:55.330 --> 13:58.124
The motherfucker wants to street-fight.
I'll show him.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.334
- Let's cancel.
- No.

14:00.544 --> 14:02.962
- Let's cancel, please.
- No!

14:19.354 --> 14:22.940
No!

14:30.157 --> 14:31.532
Yeah.

14:35.496 --> 14:39.332
Asshole! Asshole! You can't do that.

14:43.796 --> 14:47.340
Jesus Christ, get off of me. You know
you can give Americans a bad rep?

14:56.350 --> 14:58.726
He'd just as soon kill you
as look at you, kid.

14:58.936 --> 15:00.520
That's my brother.

15:01.438 --> 15:04.565
- Hey, I'm just trying to help you.
- Take us to a hospital.

15:04.775 --> 15:07.318
There's two more fights.

15:28.841 --> 15:31.008
Hey, where you going?

15:32.010 --> 15:35.429
Hey, where's the goddamn hospital?

15:35.639 --> 15:37.098
Hey, you hear me?

15:37.307 --> 15:39.100
Kurt.

15:43.355 --> 15:45.189
Don't move.

15:46.692 --> 15:48.151
Taxi.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.944
Stop.

15:50.195 --> 15:54.073
Hospital. I want to go to a hospital.

15:54.283 --> 15:57.827
No, no, no. I wanna...

15:58.036 --> 16:00.037
Hospital. Hospital.

16:05.043 --> 16:07.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:07.379 --> 16:10.214
Asshole would have probably
taken you to a whorehouse.

16:10.424 --> 16:13.342
He looks bad. Let's move it.

16:15.888 --> 16:19.015
It's cool.
I'll take him to a good hospital.

16:30.194 --> 16:33.571
All right, out, out. Go on, we'll party
later. Go on, both of you, out.

16:34.448 --> 16:36.365
Bitches never get enough
of my stuff.

16:36.575 --> 16:39.952
By the way, my name's Taylor.
Army, Special Forces. Retired, sort of.

16:40.162 --> 16:43.956
Hang on, my man. You're riding
the fastest wheels in Bangkok.

17:04.519 --> 17:05.560
Can I see him now?

17:05.771 --> 17:08.772
I'm sorry, the doctor says
come back tomorrow.

17:08.982 --> 17:11.983
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, we are doing all we can.

17:12.194 --> 17:16.280
It's going to be a long night.
You may as well get some sleep.

17:16.490 --> 17:18.281
Sleep? I can't sleep.

17:18.492 --> 17:22.994
- Please try. It's better for you.
- All right.

17:23.204 --> 17:25.080
Better for me.

17:47.604 --> 17:51.232
I'm sorry,
there's nothing more I can do.

17:51.942 --> 17:53.442
Your brother is paralyzed.

17:57.489 --> 17:59.115
What do you mean, paralyzed?

17:59.324 --> 18:03.911
The spinal cord was damaged
around the 10th vertebrae.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.164
I'm afraid he can never walk again.

18:11.044 --> 18:13.170
You're going to make him walk again.

18:13.964 --> 18:17.216
- You're going to make him walk again.
- Easy, easy, easy. Yeah, okay.

18:17.426 --> 18:20.594
- He's going to make him walk again.
- Take it easy, take it easy.

18:20.804 --> 18:24.140
- Easy, easy, easy.
- He's going to make him walk again.

18:25.058 --> 18:28.894
He's fortunate even to survive.

18:30.272 --> 18:34.567
He'll be in the hospital for at least
three months before he can be moved.

18:35.319 --> 18:38.446
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.

18:38.655 --> 18:40.406
I'm sorry.

19:03.305 --> 19:05.389
I want...

19:07.976 --> 19:10.519
I want Tong Po.

19:10.729 --> 19:14.940
Forget about it.
I'm not signing your death warrant too.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.946
Just tell me where he is.

19:21.156 --> 19:24.158
Goddamn it, no.
I don't want any fucking part of it.

19:24.368 --> 19:28.913
Go home. Wait your three months,
and go home where you're safe.

19:30.791 --> 19:34.418
I don't want your blood on my hands.
I got enough already.

19:36.213 --> 19:39.715
He's going to pay for this.
You hear me?

19:43.220 --> 19:47.098
I'll find him. I don't need your help.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.475
The only way you'll find him
is inside the ring.

19:49.684 --> 19:51.310
And you are not good enough.

19:51.812 --> 19:54.897
No matter where, I'll get him.

19:55.107 --> 19:56.565
You don't understand.

19:56.775 --> 19:59.693
You go after him outside the ring
and we're dead, all of us.

19:59.903 --> 20:01.570
He's too valuable to them.

20:02.239 --> 20:05.491
The only way is inside the ring.

20:05.700 --> 20:10.121
And like I said,
you ain't good enough.

20:12.082 --> 20:15.626
We'll see, okay?

20:17.129 --> 20:25.469
We'll see.

20:40.026 --> 20:43.112
Excuse me, sir, we have to go.

20:45.574 --> 20:48.242
Please, sir. Please.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.567
Hello. May I help you?

22:44.776 --> 22:46.652
Yes, I want to try Muay Thai.

22:46.861 --> 22:48.821
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

22:49.781 --> 22:53.033
I want him. I want Tong Po.
I want to fight him.

22:53.493 --> 22:56.036
- You?
- Yes.

23:32.157 --> 23:33.198
What do you want?

23:33.366 --> 23:35.826
You're really serious
about this Muay Thai shit?

23:36.453 --> 23:39.622
- What do you think?
- I think you're out of your mind.

23:39.831 --> 23:43.083
And if I can't stop you, I might know
somebody who will train you.

23:43.293 --> 23:46.045
- Someone?
- Maybe.

23:47.213 --> 23:48.255
Who?

23:48.423 --> 23:52.968
There's only one person crazy enough
to put you in a ring with the Tong Po.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.847
Name's Xian. Lives out in the sticks.

23:57.057 --> 23:58.307
Will he do it?

23:58.516 --> 24:01.477
I don't have any fucking idea.
That's your problem.

24:02.354 --> 24:04.021
I just know how to find him.

24:05.523 --> 24:07.524
- Let's go.
- And what if he doesn't take you?

24:07.734 --> 24:10.235
- He will. Let's go. Now.
- Now?

24:10.445 --> 24:12.613
Fuck now. We're going drinking now.

24:13.156 --> 24:14.448
I don't want to drink.

24:14.658 --> 24:17.618
If you want me to take you tomorrow,
we go drinking tonight.

24:17.827 --> 24:19.620
That's the deal.

24:22.499 --> 24:23.999
Deal.

24:24.876 --> 24:26.335
So, what's it gonna be?

24:26.544 --> 24:29.755
The Pink Pussy
or The Kitten Candy Club, huh?

24:30.757 --> 24:33.258
I don't suppose
we can just go back to the hotel?

24:33.468 --> 24:39.640
Fuck, no. Hey, relax.
I know a nice mellow place close by.

24:48.316 --> 24:53.487
Oh, baby, baby, do it, do it.
Oh, hurt me, hurt me, hurt me.

24:54.364 --> 24:57.700
- Come on.
- This is your idea of a mellow place?

24:57.909 --> 25:01.578
Oh, yeah.
I don't go to raunchy clubs anymore.

25:07.544 --> 25:10.003
You should see
how she opens a soda bottle.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.256
Move that thong, honey.

25:17.679 --> 25:20.723
Sit, sit, sit, come on.

25:27.063 --> 25:29.314
Bring me my usual.
What do you want to drink?

25:29.524 --> 25:32.985
- Just water.
- Bring him a Perrier.

25:37.824 --> 25:40.367
I just couldn't see
no reason to go back.

25:40.577 --> 25:43.579
Wasn't nothing there for me,
so I stayed.

25:43.788 --> 25:47.374
I'm better off here,
less of a danger to anybody.

25:47.584 --> 25:49.460
Why? What do you do?

25:49.669 --> 25:52.212
Guns, grenades, mines,
armored cars, tanks.

25:52.422 --> 25:54.339
Whatever I can get my hands on.

25:54.549 --> 25:57.968
Don't worry, you're safe with me.
I'm a survivor.

25:58.511 --> 26:03.766
A high-living, slick-talking,
fast-walking, cool-drinking dude.

26:04.434 --> 26:08.937
I just like to enjoy
life's many good pleasures.

26:10.482 --> 26:12.649
Let me tell you about
Tong Po's boss.

26:12.817 --> 26:17.029
Freddy Li,
that's one bad motherfucker.

26:17.572 --> 26:20.991
It's a different culture here.
A different world.

26:21.659 --> 26:27.080
You gotta come to terms with that
or you won't last a heartbeat.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.125
Why are you helping me?

26:33.171 --> 26:35.464
I had a buddy in Nam...

26:37.008 --> 26:38.509
...like an older brother.

26:39.302 --> 26:40.886
He taught me everything.

26:41.763 --> 26:44.681
How to survive and come out alive.

26:46.476 --> 26:48.685
Well, he needed me once...

26:50.146 --> 26:52.397
...and I wasn't there.

26:52.899 --> 26:54.608
I could have saved him.

26:56.152 --> 26:58.111
And I froze.

27:03.993 --> 27:10.082
Anyway, I saw a kid wanting
to help his brother. Here we are.

27:16.297 --> 27:17.589
Thanks.

27:59.549 --> 28:04.303
Here we are, my man. Shangri-la
meets Alice in Wonderland.

28:06.014 --> 28:09.391
- What is this?
- It's Xian Land.

28:09.934 --> 28:13.061
I'm telling you, man,
he's weirder than a three-headed cat.

28:13.271 --> 28:14.980
- Good luck.
- You're leaving?

28:15.189 --> 28:18.942
Yeah, I got some business up the road.
You're welcome to come along.

28:19.152 --> 28:22.696
- No, I'll take my chances here.
- All right, I'll be back in a few hours.

28:22.906 --> 28:26.283
And by the way,
don't you provoke him, you hear?

28:35.835 --> 28:37.711
Don't provoke him?

28:48.932 --> 28:52.851
- May I help you?
- Yes. Let me down.

28:53.061 --> 28:56.104
- No, I cannot.
- Why?

28:56.314 --> 28:58.523
Don't know who you are,
what you want.

28:59.025 --> 29:01.443
I want down.

29:01.653 --> 29:03.737
And I want you
to teach me Muay Thai.

29:05.239 --> 29:09.326
Really? But you are American.

29:10.453 --> 29:13.705
- So?
- Americans have swelled heads.

29:13.915 --> 29:17.125
Especially when hanging upside down
for too long.

29:19.003 --> 29:22.589
Very funny.
Can you cut me down, please?

29:22.799 --> 29:25.592
Heard about American champion
last week.

29:25.802 --> 29:30.347
Oh, very swelled head.
Lost badly in fight.

29:30.556 --> 29:34.893
That was my brother.
And now he cannot walk.

29:41.526 --> 29:45.946
Wait. Wait. Yo, hey, wait.

29:56.582 --> 30:00.794
Revenge is a dangerous motive.

30:02.213 --> 30:04.673
It's also a powerful one.

30:07.927 --> 30:09.886
Don't step there.

30:15.476 --> 30:18.687
So why you think
I teach you Muay Thai?

30:18.896 --> 30:24.109
Taylor. He said you're the only one
who might train me.

30:24.318 --> 30:26.570
Winston Taylor?

30:27.071 --> 30:29.906
- You know him?
- Yeah.

30:30.116 --> 30:33.410
Funny guy. Crazy.

30:33.619 --> 30:36.496
He said the same stuff about you.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.917
- You fight before?
- Yeah.

30:41.127 --> 30:42.502
You good?

30:42.920 --> 30:44.254
Yeah, I'm good.

30:45.298 --> 30:47.924
- Good defense?
- Yeah.

30:54.098 --> 30:58.226
Must train different in America.
Your defense stinks.

31:00.855 --> 31:02.105
Teach me.

31:04.400 --> 31:08.195
Don't know who you are.
Maybe next year.

31:08.404 --> 31:11.073
No, I must train now.

31:11.282 --> 31:15.410
- Why?
- My brother, remember?

31:27.548 --> 31:33.678
Take this path. Go to village.
At Mylee's store, get groceries.

31:33.888 --> 31:35.055
Groceries?

31:35.264 --> 31:38.767
Grocery. Rice, flour, honey.

31:38.976 --> 31:41.561
- What for?
- For lunch.

31:41.771 --> 31:44.523
Catching people in rope
make me hungry.

31:45.066 --> 31:46.191
What about training?

31:51.948 --> 31:56.493
Never make decision
on empty stomach.

32:09.423 --> 32:11.133
Ki Ki.

33:50.524 --> 33:52.609
Is this the Mylee store?

33:52.818 --> 33:55.820
Yes, I'm Mylee. May I help you?

33:56.030 --> 33:59.866
Yeah, I was sent by Mr. Xian
to get his groceries.

34:01.077 --> 34:03.912
- Uncle Xian sent you?
- He's your uncle?

34:04.121 --> 34:06.623
Yes, but how do you know him?

34:07.416 --> 34:09.918
I asked him to teach me Muay Thai.

34:11.545 --> 34:13.838
And Uncle Xian
is going to teach you?

34:14.005 --> 34:17.842
My uncle does not teach
anyone anymore.

34:20.429 --> 34:25.141
Too many people come before.
Now he prefers to be alone.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.728
Let me get his things.

34:31.732 --> 34:33.400
Where are you from?

34:33.609 --> 34:37.152
I was born in Belgium.
But now I live in Los Angeles.

34:38.072 --> 34:40.532
Why you come to Thailand?

34:41.826 --> 34:44.869
My brother came here
to fight Tong Po.

34:47.081 --> 34:49.081
He got hurt.

34:49.875 --> 34:51.333
That's why I'm here.

34:52.085 --> 34:55.170
You're going to fight Tong Po?

34:55.380 --> 34:58.133
Yes, that's why I went
to see your uncle.

34:59.051 --> 35:00.969
Tong Po very mean man.

35:01.554 --> 35:03.430
Very dangerous.

35:04.432 --> 35:08.268
- He runs this province for Freddy Li.
- What do you mean?

35:08.477 --> 35:11.896
We must all pay, or there is trouble.

35:12.106 --> 35:14.024
Get the police.

35:14.233 --> 35:17.527
Freddy Li pay police not to interfere.

35:18.070 --> 35:20.530
Please, you must say nothing.

35:21.073 --> 35:25.660
I cannot lose my store. It is all I have.

35:30.666 --> 35:33.335
Please, do not interfere.

35:33.544 --> 35:36.212
Hey, don't let these jerks
take your money.

35:36.422 --> 35:40.467
- I must pay. It is all right.
- No, it's not.

35:41.469 --> 35:43.053
Hey, give back the money.

36:08.913 --> 36:11.998
That was very stupid.

36:12.416 --> 36:13.833
What do you mean?

36:14.043 --> 36:17.879
- I get in big trouble now.
- But I did it. You didn't do it.

36:18.089 --> 36:19.464
Freddy Li won't care.

36:20.841 --> 36:24.636
And look what you did to my store.

36:25.596 --> 36:26.930
What am I supposed to do?

36:27.139 --> 36:29.140
- Let them take your money?
- Yes.

36:29.892 --> 36:32.894
I'm going to talk
to Uncle Xian about this.

36:35.898 --> 36:37.315
You don't understand.

36:56.085 --> 36:57.544
Did you get my things?

36:57.962 --> 37:00.004
Yeah, I've got everything.

37:00.631 --> 37:02.048
Good.

37:02.258 --> 37:04.134
Hey, my man, what's happening?

37:04.343 --> 37:07.053
You staying, coming, or what?
What's the story, huh?

37:07.263 --> 37:10.932
You will stay a while.
We have many things to discuss.

37:14.019 --> 37:15.562
Taylor.

37:16.647 --> 37:19.649
I mean, who wants to stay here
anyway, huh?

37:19.859 --> 37:22.861
Listen, I'll be back in a few days
to pick you up to see Eric.

37:23.529 --> 37:27.574
And you're gonna live to regret this.

37:27.783 --> 37:31.035
- Mark my word.
- Not a chance.

37:31.245 --> 37:34.622
- Come inside.
- Bye.

37:46.510 --> 37:48.553
Change clothes.

39:01.585 --> 39:03.211
Breathe.

39:03.420 --> 39:05.672
Store here.

39:06.757 --> 39:10.843
Breathe out when hit.

39:16.392 --> 39:18.518
Breathe in.

39:19.770 --> 39:21.854
Protect.

39:23.941 --> 39:30.446
If you can do both at the same time,
it's good.

40:02.438 --> 40:04.105
Ready to protect?

40:10.738 --> 40:12.071
Guess not.

40:15.159 --> 40:16.659
Kurt.

40:24.418 --> 40:26.919
This will make run faster.

40:27.129 --> 40:29.839
This? How?

40:37.890 --> 40:41.851
- He did that?
- Yes. Can you believe it?

40:42.353 --> 40:43.686
Good for him.

40:44.313 --> 40:46.189
Good?

40:47.024 --> 40:49.817
My store was a mess.

40:50.027 --> 40:53.780
I worked for days cleaning it up.

40:53.989 --> 40:56.532
But Freddy Li's goons
are also a mess.

40:58.118 --> 41:01.788
Something I want to do for you
a long time ago.

41:01.997 --> 41:05.333
But if I do, then put you in danger.

41:05.751 --> 41:09.337
American can get away with it
so it's good.

41:09.546 --> 41:14.175
Yes, but what if he doesn't
get away with it?

41:16.220 --> 41:19.847
- I worry for him.
- He will learn my way.

41:39.952 --> 41:44.580
- You're late for dinner.
- But I was supposed to get...

41:49.795 --> 41:53.005
Look, I'm sorry
if I caused you any trouble.

41:54.341 --> 41:56.968
It's okay. Do you like the food?

41:58.137 --> 42:00.972
- Excellent.
- My niece has many talents.

42:01.181 --> 42:04.225
Good to help training too. You see.

42:04.768 --> 42:07.687
I'm sure. I can't wait.

42:09.690 --> 42:10.732
Eat your food.

42:16.238 --> 42:21.117
So our parents divorced when Eric
and I were both in grade school.

42:21.326 --> 42:25.455
Mom raised me in Europe,
and Dad raised Eric in America.

42:26.290 --> 42:31.794
In some ways, we're different.
But we're brothers.

42:32.588 --> 42:35.548
And now it's all the family we've got.

42:35.799 --> 42:38.217
You are very fortunate.

42:38.552 --> 42:42.388
At least, the both of you
had the love of one parent.

42:42.931 --> 42:45.641
I never knew mine.

42:45.851 --> 42:50.730
My entire family was taken
when I was just an infant.

42:51.148 --> 42:56.277
But fate has also provided me
with Uncle Xian...

42:56.487 --> 42:58.613
...so I am happy.

42:59.364 --> 43:02.825
Uncle Xian, he's very different.

43:03.035 --> 43:04.869
Yes.

43:05.162 --> 43:07.622
And very wise.

43:07.998 --> 43:13.711
But if you stay with him,
he will make you the best you can be.

43:15.923 --> 43:18.007
And you're going to help?

43:19.510 --> 43:21.719
I used to help my Uncle Xian.

43:22.971 --> 43:26.474
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.

43:29.812 --> 43:31.479
Must you fight him?

43:31.688 --> 43:33.773
I have to.

43:39.947 --> 43:42.031
You're so beautiful.

43:56.255 --> 43:58.589
I have to go now.

44:14.439 --> 44:16.440
What is this?

44:16.817 --> 44:22.154
This is Stone City,
where many ancient warriors come.

44:22.698 --> 44:26.784
While you train here, listen.

44:27.953 --> 44:30.079
Listen to what?

44:30.455 --> 44:37.336
Just listen. With your mind,
your heart, your whole being.

44:38.589 --> 44:43.092
You must learn to be faster
than any punch or kick.

44:43.385 --> 44:46.220
That way, you won't get hit.

45:07.034 --> 45:10.494
Low kick, move legs, okay? Okay.

47:03.108 --> 47:05.067
Is that enough?

47:59.331 --> 48:00.748
Winner: Palm tree.

48:38.954 --> 48:40.788
Tong Po.

49:50.609 --> 49:52.526
Kick the tree.

50:02.829 --> 50:03.871
That's it.

50:05.123 --> 50:08.876
Take your bag, and leave my house.

50:09.544 --> 50:12.046
What? What's going on?

50:12.255 --> 50:14.006
You don't want training.

50:14.382 --> 50:17.426
Hey, you want me to break my leg?

50:22.432 --> 50:25.517
Your brother, remember?

50:30.857 --> 50:32.733
You want this?

50:33.360 --> 50:34.860
What about this?

52:44.157 --> 52:47.284
- Ready to protect?
- Yeah.

52:56.044 --> 52:57.669
I'm okay.

53:16.481 --> 53:18.440
No step there.

53:21.528 --> 53:22.736
Good timing.

53:23.238 --> 53:27.199
I go make lunch?
Then maybe we take a walk?

53:35.250 --> 53:39.336
- What did he say?
- Your training not finished today.

53:39.546 --> 53:42.297
After lunch,
he take you to a special place.

53:42.465 --> 53:43.507
A special place?

54:29.471 --> 54:35.476
- What am I supposed to learn here?
- Learn later. First, relax.

54:47.947 --> 54:49.031
Hot.

55:02.337 --> 55:05.005
It's good stuff. What is this?

55:05.507 --> 55:08.383
Translated, "kiss of death."

55:08.593 --> 55:12.513
- You like?
- Oh, yeah, it's good stuff, man.

55:13.097 --> 55:16.058
- You good dancer?
- Dancing?

55:16.267 --> 55:19.061
Yeah, American dancing. Disco.

55:19.270 --> 55:22.064
Oh, yeah, dancing. I'm good, why?

55:22.273 --> 55:26.944
I'd like to see you dance.
Observe your balance.

55:31.324 --> 55:32.491
Here? Really?

57:45.083 --> 57:55.550
Xian.

58:03.226 --> 58:04.685
Xian?

58:04.894 --> 58:10.148
- Brother lose very badly to Tong Po.
- But this brother different.

58:10.358 --> 58:13.610
You see how he embarrassed
your young fighters inside?

58:13.820 --> 58:16.446
Why not set up fight
with your good fighters?

58:16.948 --> 58:19.241
You will not be disappointed.

58:23.121 --> 58:25.080
Xian.

58:27.041 --> 58:30.794
What happened?
Why those guys try to hurt me?

58:31.003 --> 58:33.004
- Did they succeed?
- No.

58:33.214 --> 58:34.631
Good.

58:34.841 --> 58:38.635
Why did you leave,
and why they were so pissed at me?

58:38.845 --> 58:42.305
Because I tell them you say,
they no good fighters.

58:42.515 --> 58:45.100
And that their mother
have sex with mules.

58:45.768 --> 58:48.645
- You what?
- Oh, make them very angry.

58:48.855 --> 58:51.565
Fight hard, good training.

58:53.651 --> 58:58.029
And now you drive me in pedicab.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.662
Go.

59:10.752 --> 59:12.169
He looks pretty mean to me.

59:15.840 --> 59:18.842
- And tough.
- Thanks, Taylor.

59:19.051 --> 59:22.596
What about Xian?
What does he have to tell me?

59:25.308 --> 59:27.517
Roughly translated:

59:27.727 --> 59:30.020
"Kick the motherfucker's ass."

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:26.952
Yes.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:51.476
Nak Soo Khao.

01:00:51.644 --> 01:00:54.271
- Nak Soo Khao.
- Nak Soo Khao.

01:00:54.438 --> 01:00:56.439
Nak Soo Khao.

01:00:56.649 --> 01:00:59.359
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:00:59.777 --> 01:01:09.703
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!
Nak Soo Khao!

01:01:09.871 --> 01:01:12.706
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:01:12.915 --> 01:01:14.958
What are they saying?

01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:16.251
Nak Soo Khao.

01:01:16.419 --> 01:01:17.919
"White Warrior."

01:01:18.087 --> 01:01:22.591
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!
Nak Soo Khao!

01:01:22.758 --> 01:01:25.969
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:01:26.137 --> 01:01:27.470
I want Tong Po.

01:01:27.638 --> 01:01:29.472
Nak Soo Khao!

01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:31.725
Give me Tong Po!

01:01:31.893 --> 01:01:34.728
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:11.598
Hey, Eric.

01:02:12.058 --> 01:02:13.224
They let you out early?

01:02:13.434 --> 01:02:16.978
I told them they'd be sorry
if they didn't. I'd raise hell.

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:22.400
Congratulations.
I heard about your fight last night.

01:02:22.777 --> 01:02:24.152
I wish you were there.

01:02:24.362 --> 01:02:27.739
They call me "Nak Soo Khao,"
the White Warrior.

01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:28.990
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:29.158 --> 01:02:32.035
Let's talk more about that later.
Right now, I'm starved.

01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:33.995
Got breakfast out here
in the boonies?

01:02:34.163 --> 01:02:36.081
Are you kidding? The best.

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:39.459
- I go make some right now.
- Wait, I'll help. I ain't cooked in ages.

01:02:39.669 --> 01:02:42.253
I'll make my specialty.
Jungle Survivor Quiche. Come on.

01:02:44.924 --> 01:02:48.176
- What do you need for that quiche?
- It's cobra heads.

01:02:48.386 --> 01:02:50.136
Morning, Xian.

01:02:50.346 --> 01:02:51.888
I'll see you inside.

01:03:26.882 --> 01:03:29.134
Good morning, Eric.

01:03:29.677 --> 01:03:33.138
Hi. Is Kurt around?

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:37.142
He's training on his own.
Be back later.

01:06:20.598 --> 01:06:23.933
So, Ki Ki, what do you think?
I'm ready or what?

01:06:27.104 --> 01:06:30.398
- Yes, thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Kurt.

01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:32.650
Let's talk.

01:06:32.818 --> 01:06:37.739
One day, that dog is going
to believe in me. What's up?

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:40.909
I don't want you to fight him.

01:06:42.536 --> 01:06:45.163
- What?
- I don't want you to fight Tong Po.

01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:47.248
You know what I'm saying.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:50.627
Eric, he put you
in that wheelchair for life.

01:06:50.836 --> 01:06:54.005
That's right. And I don't want
you in one alongside me.

01:06:54.673 --> 01:06:56.716
Give it up, let's go home.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.761
I should have listened to you.

01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:04.015
And now it's your turn to listen to me.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.520
- No, look at me. I can beat him.
- That's what I thought.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:12.106
I trained Muay Thai with the old man.

01:07:12.316 --> 01:07:15.276
- It's different.
- Tong Po is a killer, Kurt.

01:07:16.028 --> 01:07:20.365
Wake up. He's not gonna let you
out of that ring alive.

01:07:21.533 --> 01:07:26.621
Eric, I'm in the best shape of my life.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:32.126
I'm a better fighter than I ever was
before. Than you ever were.

01:07:34.713 --> 01:07:36.673
I can beat Tong Po.

01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:41.302
I'll win that fight for you and me.

01:07:41.929 --> 01:07:45.640
Kurt. Kurt, come quick.

01:07:46.225 --> 01:07:47.809
Let's go.

01:07:55.359 --> 01:07:59.362
- What's going on?
- A message from Freddy Li.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.447
Why is he dressed like that?

01:08:01.657 --> 01:08:05.118
He's wearing the traditional robes
of a messenger...

01:08:05.327 --> 01:08:09.372
...sent to bring news of a fight,
the ancient way.

01:08:09.581 --> 01:08:11.708
Ancient way?

01:08:26.348 --> 01:08:29.850
He says, you will fight the old ways.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.982
Hands wrapped in hemp and resin
dipped in broken glass.

01:08:36.191 --> 01:08:37.442
Bullshit.

01:08:55.711 --> 01:08:59.546
- Kurt?
- I have to go.

01:09:00.299 --> 01:09:03.718
Wait a goddamn minute. You're not
gonna fight that asshole like that.

01:09:04.219 --> 01:09:08.555
Kurt, listen to me.
I'll kick your ass all over the place.

01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:11.725
Kurt, listen to me!

01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:13.560
Damn.

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:35.124
This is Stone City,
where many ancient warriors come.

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:39.754
While you train here, listen.

01:10:11.537 --> 01:10:17.500
Tao Liu. Master warlord,
I come with a good news and request.

01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:18.751
Speak.

01:10:19.211 --> 01:10:23.673
I have arranged a fight between
Tong Po and American challenger.

01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:30.263
He has been trained by Xian Chow.

01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:35.977
- Xian Chow?
- The American will not win.

01:10:36.186 --> 01:10:38.187
I promise you.

01:10:38.397 --> 01:10:41.357
They will fight the ancient way.

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:45.486
In the old underground tomb.

01:10:45.779 --> 01:10:47.488
What is your request?

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:53.077
I want to borrow $1 million
to bet on Tong Po.

01:10:57.124 --> 01:11:00.293
I trust you will not fail me.

01:11:01.879 --> 01:11:04.297
It's all being arranged.

01:11:10.846 --> 01:11:15.391
No, no, no.

01:11:20.397 --> 01:11:36.913
No.

01:12:19.957 --> 01:12:21.332
Tong Po.

01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:55.843
Get him, Ki Ki.

01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:20.409
Eric, where are you, buddy?
We gotta get going.

01:14:20.619 --> 01:14:23.120
I got held up on some business, and...

01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:52.775
- What the hell happened?
- Freddy Li.

01:14:53.402 --> 01:14:54.902
- You were here?
- No.

01:14:55.112 --> 01:14:57.947
You think I would have
let them take him if I was?

01:14:58.448 --> 01:15:00.324
You've done it before.

01:15:03.578 --> 01:15:06.831
Taylor, Ki Ki's still alive.
Take us to town.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.791
To the doctor.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.502
Please.

01:15:14.172 --> 01:15:16.257
I'll get the van.

01:15:16.967 --> 01:15:19.844
They want to make sure you not win.

01:15:26.059 --> 01:15:27.101
You can find him.

01:15:27.269 --> 01:15:30.563
If you're smart, do whatever
they tell you or they'll kill both of you.

01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:33.566
Come on, Winston. Help me.

01:15:34.776 --> 01:15:38.612
I ain't crossing Freddy Li.

01:15:41.074 --> 01:15:45.119
Okay, go. Be a chickenshit
all your life.

01:15:45.328 --> 01:15:49.790
Like I said before,
I don't need your help.

01:16:04.806 --> 01:16:07.725
- You must help Kurt.
- I'm out of it.

01:16:07.934 --> 01:16:09.935
Listen to me.

01:16:11.313 --> 01:16:13.355
Tong Po...

01:16:15.358 --> 01:16:17.526
Tong Po raped me.

01:16:21.072 --> 01:16:27.036
But I did not tell Kurt.
His mind must be clear for the fight.

01:16:27.496 --> 01:16:28.829
So you see...

01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:33.375
...you must help him find Eric.

01:17:16.044 --> 01:17:17.503
Tong Po.

01:17:17.712 --> 01:17:32.935
Tong Po, Tong Po, Tong Po!

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.153
Seven.

01:18:27.782 --> 01:18:29.283
- You going to go?
- Maybe.

01:18:31.703 --> 01:18:33.370
I'll go in.

01:18:51.598 --> 01:18:53.474
Xian?

01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:56.560
Where is he?

01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:04.128
Hey, you want brother alive?

01:20:04.337 --> 01:20:05.921
My bro...?

01:20:07.674 --> 01:20:10.342
Make crowd happy.

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:14.888
Let Tong Po punish you
all the rounds.

01:20:15.932 --> 01:20:18.892
You must last to the end.

01:20:19.519 --> 01:20:23.147
Or brother die very slowly.

01:20:23.732 --> 01:20:28.110
You understand, huh?

01:25:25.658 --> 01:25:28.327
Go on, kill him.

01:26:07.492 --> 01:26:09.493
I was waiting for you, Winston.

01:26:09.702 --> 01:26:12.662
- Why so late?
- Sorry I took so long.

01:26:12.872 --> 01:26:15.707
Traffic was a mess.
There's a big fight in town.

01:26:31.099 --> 01:26:33.308
Thanks. Now we're even.

01:26:33.518 --> 01:26:35.602
Now Ki Ki even too.

01:28:07.028 --> 01:28:09.279
You bleed like Mylee.

01:28:10.656 --> 01:28:14.409
Mylee good fuck.

01:28:14.619 --> 01:28:16.661
No!

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.305
Tell me. Tell me the truth.

01:28:36.182 --> 01:28:38.099
Tell me.

01:28:42.855 --> 01:28:45.774
Kurt, Kurt...

01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:50.403
I love you.

01:29:15.263 --> 01:29:18.223
Nak Soo Khao. Nak Soo Khao.

01:29:18.474 --> 01:29:19.641
Nak Soo Khao.

01:29:20.142 --> 01:29:23.520
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:29:23.688 --> 01:29:28.692
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!
Nak Soo Khao!

01:29:28.901 --> 01:29:31.778
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:29:31.988 --> 01:29:33.530
Get him, Kurt.

01:29:33.698 --> 01:29:36.324
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:29:41.122 --> 01:29:43.540
Mylee, cut these ropes.

01:29:43.749 --> 01:29:46.835
- What?
- Just cut them.

01:29:47.003 --> 01:29:54.843
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:29:55.011 --> 01:29:57.012
- He's coming.
- Don't worry.

01:29:57.179 --> 01:30:02.601
Nak Soo Khao! Nak Soo Khao!

01:30:03.603 --> 01:30:32.672
Yeah.

01:31:29.271 --> 01:31:31.189
Come on, get up.

01:31:31.399 --> 01:31:33.358
Get him.

01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:04.514
Yes.

01:32:21.198 --> 01:32:22.657
Get him.

01:32:26.412 --> 01:33:22.509
Yeah.

01:33:23.385 --> 01:33:25.845
That's the way, baby.

01:33:27.973 --> 01:33:31.267
Yeah. Good fight, my man.

01:33:33.562 --> 01:33:36.314
Yeah. Thank you.
