00:27.494 --> 00:29.896
<i>So this
is really goodbye.</i>

00:29.996 --> 00:31.498
<i>I'm gonna
miss you, girl.</i>

00:33.199 --> 00:36.336
<i>I can't thank you enough
for everything.</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:39.439
<i>You were as much
a member of the team
as any of us.</i>

00:39.539 --> 00:42.208
<i>Crashest. Ride. Ever.</i>

00:54.220 --> 00:57.390
<i>Yeah. I mean...</i>

00:57.457 --> 01:00.760
<i>I'm sad,
but I want her to be happy.</i>

01:02.262 --> 01:03.797
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:08.368
<i>Not really.
It's very hard to lose her,</i>

01:08.435 --> 01:14.040
<i>but I understand her decision
and I'll be fine eventually.</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:20.547
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

01:20.613 --> 01:23.049
<i>Baby's taking care
of our family now.</i>

02:53.540 --> 02:55.074
<i>How did you
find me?</i>

02:55.175 --> 02:57.377
<i>You know I do this
professionally, right?</i>

02:57.477 --> 02:59.012
<i>So you're
arresting me again?</i>

02:59.078 --> 03:01.481
<i>I should.
And someday, I might.</i>

03:01.548 --> 03:04.050
<i>I still can't forgive
what you did to those two kids</i>

03:04.150 --> 03:06.085
<i>on New Genesis.</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:08.588
<i>But you're a Martian on Mars.</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:10.990
<i>I don't have the authority
to arrest you here</i>

03:11.057 --> 03:12.659
<i>for crimes committed off world.</i>

03:12.725 --> 03:14.260
<i>A rematch, then?</i>

03:14.360 --> 03:16.930
<i>I didn't come
to fight.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:19.199
<i>-I came to apologize.
What?</i>

03:19.265 --> 03:23.102
<i>When I went to Earth,
I never should have
left you behind.</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.371
<i>I'm truly sorry, M'comm.</i>

03:27.240 --> 03:31.578
<i>My name's
not M'comm. It's Ma'alefa'ak.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:37.917
<i>Even... Even if
you can't forgive me,</i>

03:38.017 --> 03:41.387
<i>it's not too late
to reconcile with our family.</i>

03:41.454 --> 03:45.391
<i>What family?</i>

03:45.458 --> 03:48.928
<i>As for our parents,
you can say goodbye to Mom</i>

03:49.028 --> 03:51.197
<i>and tell Dad I'm sorry.</i>

03:53.967 --> 03:55.435
<i>Good luck with the wedding.</i>

04:01.274 --> 04:05.878
<i>C'eridy'all,
Goddess of life,</i>

04:05.945 --> 04:09.582
<i>Bless this altar
and this canopy,</i>

04:09.649 --> 04:12.986
<i>built with passion
and affection.</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:16.656
<i>With thy power,
fill M'gann and Conner</i>

04:16.756 --> 04:19.392
<i>with the light of Ma'ayava'ana.</i>

04:22.428 --> 04:24.597
<i>The Light of Love.</i>

04:24.664 --> 04:28.568
<i>You honor us with such
a beautiful blessing, S'yraa.</i>

04:29.402 --> 04:31.504
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:34.674
<i>I am honored
to be officiating at your
daughter's wedding tomorrow.</i>

04:34.774 --> 04:38.845
<i>M'gann and Conner's love
is inspirational.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.249
<i>Ask her.</i>

04:43.316 --> 04:46.085
<i>Is there something
I might help you with, Em'ree?</i>

04:46.152 --> 04:48.288
<i>No. Or yes.</i>

04:48.354 --> 04:51.291
<i>I'm a scientist-atheist.</i>

04:51.357 --> 04:54.861
<i>I can't be asking
a priestess for advice.</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:57.597
<i>Then perhaps
you could ask a friend.</i>

04:59.032 --> 05:00.667
<i>It's M'gann.</i>

05:00.767 --> 05:03.503
<i>Everything she said
about me yesterday was true.</i>

05:03.603 --> 05:06.472
<i>I wasn't there
for her or our brother</i>

05:06.539 --> 05:08.941
<i>because I was afraid
of what others might think.</i>

05:09.008 --> 05:10.610
<i>What can I do?</i>

05:10.677 --> 05:13.646
<i>How can I possibly
make it up to her?</i>

05:13.713 --> 05:18.017
<i>Well, to start,
tell her you're sorry.</i>

05:25.058 --> 05:26.793
<i>This place
is so crash!</i>

05:26.859 --> 05:28.494
<i>Your party's gonna crush it!</i>

05:28.561 --> 05:30.396
<i>Apologies.</i>

05:30.496 --> 05:33.733
<i>I don't believe
the psychic translation
is working properly.</i>

05:33.833 --> 05:35.401
<i>He just wanted
to thank you</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:37.704
<i>for inviting us
to your birthday celebration.</i>

05:37.804 --> 05:40.206
<i>Yeah, that.
My pleasure.</i>

05:40.306 --> 05:43.176
<i>I understand.
I hate birthday fuss, too.</i>

05:43.242 --> 05:45.244
<i>The day before
we arrived on Mars,</i>

05:45.345 --> 05:48.514
<i>M'gann threw a surprise
birthday party for me
onboard Bio-Ship.</i>

05:48.581 --> 05:50.083
<i>It makes her happy, but--</i>

05:50.183 --> 05:52.418
<i>But maybe
that's not the problem?</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:56.055
<i>No, it hurts
that I won't be</i>

05:56.155 --> 05:58.257
<i>able to share this day
with my father.</i>

05:58.358 --> 06:01.094
<i>Don't worry.
We'll bring the king's killer
to justice.</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:03.596
<i>-We promise--
To do our best.</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:06.766
<i>Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:09.335
<i>I still have much to prepare
before tonight.</i>

06:12.872 --> 06:14.440
<i>We have to go.</i>

06:14.540 --> 06:15.908
<i>But you
psychically camouflaged us.</i>

06:16.008 --> 06:18.177
<i>Miss Martian's coming.</i>

06:18.244 --> 06:19.879
<i>We can't risk her recognizing
my psychic signature
from the cave-in.</i>

06:19.946 --> 06:21.447
<i>I still don't understand</i>

06:21.547 --> 06:22.849
<i>how we're supposed
to complete our mission</i>

06:22.915 --> 06:24.217
<i>if we can't stay close.</i>

06:24.283 --> 06:25.852
<i>I'm really not sure.</i>

06:25.918 --> 06:27.453
<i>But what choice do we have?</i>

06:28.121 --> 06:29.589
<i>Come on.</i>

06:29.689 --> 06:31.591
<i>So,
how did it go?</i>

06:31.691 --> 06:33.726
<i>About as well
as I thought it would.</i>

06:33.793 --> 06:35.128
<i>That bad, huh?</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:36.929
<i>How are things here?</i>

06:37.029 --> 06:39.198
<i>We need to get on
with the investigation.</i>

06:39.265 --> 06:41.901
<i>Gar promised J'emm
we'd find answers for him.</i>

06:41.968 --> 06:44.237
<i>And we still think
the King's death is connected</i>

06:44.303 --> 06:45.938
<i>to the destruction
of the Zeta-Tube</i>

06:46.038 --> 06:47.640
<i>in the M'arzz-Earth
Communications Satellite?</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:49.409
<i>That's the theory.</i>

06:49.475 --> 06:50.877
<i>We should do
an even more thorough review</i>

06:50.943 --> 06:52.412
<i>of the intel J'emm provided.</i>

06:52.478 --> 06:53.813
<i>Where can we go to do that?</i>

06:53.913 --> 06:55.615
<i>We don't have
to go anywhere.</i>

06:58.317 --> 07:00.386
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

07:00.453 --> 07:02.422
<i>The king's body was found
in the Grand Hall
of the Royal Palace.</i>

07:02.488 --> 07:04.724
<i>I found traces
of a familiar residue.</i>

07:04.791 --> 07:06.826
<i>I've seen something
like it before,</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:08.761
<i>but can't quite place it.</i>

07:08.828 --> 07:10.396
<i>I've tasted
multiple individual
Martian traces</i>

07:10.463 --> 07:12.432
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

07:12.498 --> 07:14.167
<i>Then let's find out
who was in the palace
that night.</i>

07:16.469 --> 07:19.272
<i>Your Majesty,
I must insist.</i>

07:19.338 --> 07:22.275
<i>We are better off
without the Earthers.</i>

07:22.341 --> 07:25.845
<i>But my late husband
was very much in favor</i>

07:25.945 --> 07:27.513
<i>of a M'arzz-Earth alliance.</i>

07:27.613 --> 07:30.483
<i>Perhaps,
but given recent events,</i>

07:30.583 --> 07:32.919
<i>it seemed clear
that even the King</i>

07:32.985 --> 07:36.155
<i>would have changed his mind,
were he still alive.</i>

07:36.255 --> 07:40.426
<i>Now you presume
to understand
how my father thinks?</i>

07:40.493 --> 07:42.695
<i>You go too far, R'ess E'dda.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:44.831
<i>These are adult concerns.</i>

07:44.931 --> 07:47.033
<i>I would not expect
a child to understand.</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:49.702
<i>I am
Prince of the Realm.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:53.439
<i>Do not tell me what I do
and do not understand.</i>

07:53.506 --> 07:57.109
<i>And do not put words
in the mind of my late father.</i>

07:57.176 --> 08:00.546
<i>Your Majesty, surely
you will not allow this youth--</i>

08:00.646 --> 08:03.216
<i>Your prince
has spoken, R'ess.</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
<i>Nothing's
leaping out in the files</i>

08:14.560 --> 08:16.562
<i>for the M'hontrss or Consuls
who were at the palace
that day.</i>

08:16.662 --> 08:20.132
<i>Nothing on the nobles,
priests and priestesses either.</i>

08:20.199 --> 08:23.336
<i>Guys, guys,
check it out.
I found a discrepancy.</i>

08:23.402 --> 08:26.806
<i>According to this,
seven servants entered
the palace that day,</i>

08:26.873 --> 08:30.343
<i>but only six left.
The numbers don't add up.</i>

08:30.409 --> 08:32.979
<i>This one.
She entered the palace,</i>

08:33.045 --> 08:35.014
<i>but there's no record
of her leaving.</i>

08:35.081 --> 08:36.849
<i>At least not through
any of the palace gates...</i>

08:36.916 --> 08:39.185
<i>Making her
our lead suspect.</i>

08:39.252 --> 08:41.254
<i>I hate to admit it,</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:43.923
<i>but I was really hoping
the killer wouldn't turn out
to be A'ashenn.</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:47.059
<i>Maybe the M'hontrr
at the gate saw something
when she entered.</i>

08:47.159 --> 08:48.561
<i>No one came in
that night</i>

08:48.661 --> 08:50.930
<i>except a couple
of A'ashenn servants.</i>

08:51.030 --> 08:53.366
<i>Honestly, I didn't pay
much attention to them,</i>

08:53.432 --> 08:56.536
<i>but feel free to review
my memories of the evening.</i>

08:56.602 --> 08:58.504
<i>Got R'ohh K'arr's memory record
right here.</i>

08:58.571 --> 09:01.774
<i>There.
Another servant entered
with our suspect.</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:04.744
<i>His name is Kar Ming.
Here's his interview.</i>

09:04.844 --> 09:07.780
<i>I didn't see anything.
Nothing at all.</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:08.881
<i>That's it?</i>

09:08.948 --> 09:10.449
<i>That's his whole interview?</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:13.252
<i>We need to talk
to this K'arr M'angg.</i>

09:15.721 --> 09:18.190
<i>Wow.
Little cramped in here, huh?</i>

09:18.257 --> 09:22.028
<i>Not that
the B'lahdenns or G'arrunns
ever noticed.</i>

09:22.094 --> 09:25.298
<i>Let's just find
our Martian.</i>

09:25.398 --> 09:28.601
<i>According to his file,
his home should be
right over here.</i>

09:35.308 --> 09:36.442
<i>K'arr M'angg, I am--</i>

09:36.542 --> 09:38.210
<i>I know who you are.</i>

09:38.277 --> 09:41.380
<i>The niece of J'onn J'onzz
and the Outsiders of Earth.</i>

09:41.447 --> 09:43.816
<i>The whole city's been
sending about you three.</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:45.551
<i>Flattering, I guess.</i>

09:45.618 --> 09:47.987
<i>We've been looking
into the King's murder.</i>

09:48.087 --> 09:50.222
<i>-I had nothing to do--
You're not a suspect.</i>

09:50.289 --> 09:52.725
<i>We were wondering
if you could tell us anything</i>

09:52.792 --> 09:54.660
<i>about the female
A'ashenn servant</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:56.729
<i>that entered the palace
with you that night.</i>

09:56.796 --> 09:59.966
<i>Oh, her.
She wasn't A'ashenn.</i>

10:00.066 --> 10:01.434
<i>She wasn't?</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:03.169
<i>She was a G'arrunn
posing as A'ashenn.</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:06.172
<i>But how did
R'ohh K'arr not catch that?</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:09.675
<i>You can't change color
without others realizing.</i>

10:09.775 --> 10:11.944
<i>-Believe me, I know.
Please.</i>

10:12.011 --> 10:13.846
<i>It would never occur
to a G'arrunn</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:18.250
<i>that another G'arrunn would
ever pretend to be A'ashenn.</i>

10:18.317 --> 10:21.187
<i>R'ohh K'arr took
no notice of her.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:23.856
<i>He takes no notice
of any of us.</i>

10:23.956 --> 10:26.125
<i>He hardly sees us as Martians.</i>

10:26.192 --> 10:27.994
<i>Why didn't you
tell this to the M'hontrrs</i>

10:28.094 --> 10:29.695
<i>after the king's death?</i>

10:29.795 --> 10:33.032
<i>My kind knows better
than to trust M'hontrrs.</i>

10:33.132 --> 10:35.201
<i>That is why I keep this.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:38.537
<i>There's a reminder
that if I tell the truth,</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:41.841
<i>I would only be
making trouble for myself.</i>

10:41.941 --> 10:45.845
<i>G'arrunns would never believe
a G'arrunn killed the king.</i>

10:45.945 --> 10:47.680
<i>Then why tell us now?</i>

10:47.780 --> 10:50.650
<i>Because she
is one of us.</i>

11:16.876 --> 11:19.045
<i>There's
old king Ma'arrun!</i>

11:19.145 --> 11:20.579
<i>And Queen Sykara!</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:23.482
<i>All of our great leaders!</i>

11:23.549 --> 11:24.850
<i>There's S'turnn!</i>

11:29.155 --> 11:31.724
<i>Prince J'emm!
Best yet!</i>

11:31.824 --> 11:33.325
<i>Come now, Jem.</i>

11:33.392 --> 11:35.227
<i>This is a glorious day,</i>

11:35.327 --> 11:37.830
<i>one that would have
made your father proud.</i>

11:37.897 --> 11:42.601
<i>Please try to dispel
the dark cloud shadowing
your face and mind.</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:43.769
<i>I'll try, Mother.</i>

11:46.105 --> 11:47.206
<i>Excuse me.</i>

11:48.274 --> 11:49.909
<i>You have news? I can tell.</i>

11:50.009 --> 11:51.744
<i>We have
a new lead suspect.</i>

11:51.844 --> 11:53.179
<i>Show me.</i>

11:53.245 --> 11:54.947
<i>We've discovered
that a G'arrunn female</i>

11:55.047 --> 11:58.617
<i>entered the palace that night
posing as an A'ashenn servant.</i>

11:58.718 --> 11:59.919
<i>I see.</i>

12:01.253 --> 12:03.756
<i>Good work. Perhaps you could,</i>

12:03.856 --> 12:07.259
<i>um, give me a moment
to absorb this.</i>

12:19.138 --> 12:20.106
<i>Hello, Megan.</i>

12:20.206 --> 12:21.474
<i>It was right there</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:22.975
<i>-the whole time.
What?</i>

12:23.075 --> 12:24.443
<i>Zatanna's spells
always leave behind</i>

12:24.543 --> 12:26.245
<i>microscopic magical residue</i>

12:26.312 --> 12:29.148
<i>that looks slightly different
than, say, Doctor Fate's.</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:31.250
<i>-Or Thirteen's.
Residue? Gross.</i>

12:31.317 --> 12:32.985
<i>Gar, focus.</i>

12:33.085 --> 12:35.321
<i>Each magic-user's
residue is like a signature.</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:38.324
<i>And Martian magic
is basically a signature
in a different language.</i>

12:38.424 --> 12:40.426
<i>That's why I didn't
recognize it before.</i>

12:40.493 --> 12:41.961
<i>I'm sure of it now.</i>

12:42.061 --> 12:44.096
<i>Ma'a.</i>

12:44.163 --> 12:48.067
<i>Come on. We have to find J'emm.
I'll explain on the way.</i>

12:48.134 --> 12:50.402
<i>S'yraa told me that she
and J'emm were together,</i>

12:50.469 --> 12:54.173
<i>before the fact that they were
from different castes
forced them apart.</i>

12:55.341 --> 12:56.275
<i>S'yraa.</i>

12:57.576 --> 12:58.911
<i>J'emm.</i>

12:58.978 --> 13:00.446
<i>S'yraa said
she agreed to marry us</i>

13:00.513 --> 13:02.581
<i>because she wanted
to bring about change.</i>

13:02.648 --> 13:05.151
<i>I think she also wanted
to give us,</i>

13:05.251 --> 13:06.986
<i>what she herself couldn't have</i>

13:07.086 --> 13:09.188
<i>because King S'turnn
forbade it.</i>

13:09.288 --> 13:11.457
<i>My father
always believed</i>

13:11.524 --> 13:14.794
<i>that the prejudices separating
G'arrunn and A'ashenn</i>

13:14.860 --> 13:16.595
<i>were ridiculous.</i>

13:16.662 --> 13:20.099
<i>That there was
no real difference
between the two races.</i>

13:20.866 --> 13:22.835
<i>But...</i>

13:22.935 --> 13:24.436
<i>I'll bet the king
still believed B'lahdenns
were superior</i>

13:24.503 --> 13:26.205
<i>to both A'ashenns
and G'arrunns.</i>

13:26.305 --> 13:28.207
<i>He felt
the Royal Bloodline</i>

13:28.307 --> 13:30.442
<i>had to remain
B'lahdenn and pure,</i>

13:30.509 --> 13:34.180
<i>So S'turnn
wouldn't allow his son
to marry a G'arrunn.</i>

13:34.280 --> 13:35.881
<i>Which is why
you killed him.</i>

13:35.981 --> 13:38.717
<i>J'emm, no,
it's not true.</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:41.654
<i>You know, I'd never even been
to the palace.</i>

13:41.720 --> 13:43.823
<i>You never brought me there.</i>

13:43.889 --> 13:47.059
<i>Liar!
I definitely tasted her there.</i>

13:47.159 --> 13:49.728
<i>And we've got
a match on her magic residue.</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:52.865
<i>So it was you.</i>

13:52.965 --> 13:54.300
<i>No. No, no, no.</i>

13:54.366 --> 13:56.402
<i>No, I didn't mean to.</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:59.171
<i>I... I...</i>

13:59.238 --> 14:00.472
<i>Everyone, get back!</i>

14:00.539 --> 14:02.041
<i>We've got to stop this</i>

14:02.141 --> 14:03.542
<i>before she brings
the whole place down.</i>

14:03.642 --> 14:05.177
<i>Prince J'emm,
get clear!</i>

14:05.244 --> 14:06.745
<i>J'emm, please,
get out of the way!</i>

14:06.846 --> 14:08.848
<i>No, S'yraa,
you must stop this.</i>

14:08.914 --> 14:11.317
<i>I can't!
You'll have to.</i>

14:11.383 --> 14:13.385
<i>Or you'll have to kill me.</i>

14:13.485 --> 14:16.255
<i>Please,
I don't want to kill you.</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:18.591
<i>I never wanted
to hurt you. I...</i>

14:20.259 --> 14:21.694
<i>I still love you.</i>

14:25.030 --> 14:28.267
<i>I simply do not
understand, S'yraa.</i>

14:28.367 --> 14:33.606
<i>No matter his failings,
how could you murder my father?</i>

14:33.706 --> 14:36.408
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

14:36.508 --> 14:39.912
<i>I only snuck
into the palace to talk.</i>

14:40.012 --> 14:42.448
<i>I was sure if I opened
my mind to him,</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:45.684
<i>and he read just
how much I loved his son,</i>

14:45.751 --> 14:49.788
<i>he'd have a change of heart
and give us his blessing.</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:55.861
<i>But he was so dismissive,
so contemptuous.</i>

14:55.928 --> 14:58.797
<i>I was upset. And my power...</i>

14:58.898 --> 15:01.600
<i>I never felt I had a calling,</i>

15:01.700 --> 15:04.403
<i>but I did study
with the Sorcerer-Priesthood</i>

15:04.470 --> 15:07.072
<i>to help me control my magic.</i>

15:07.139 --> 15:09.708
<i>But when I fell in love
with you,</i>

15:09.775 --> 15:11.644
<i>I neglected my studies.</i>

15:11.744 --> 15:16.081
<i>And because of that, I couldn't
control my magic that night.</i>

15:16.916 --> 15:18.284
<i>Thought became action,</i>

15:18.384 --> 15:20.719
<i>and before I had time
to take it back...</i>

15:26.325 --> 15:28.227
<i>Then I panicked and morphed,</i>

15:28.294 --> 15:30.329
<i>sneaking out
through the plumbing.</i>

15:30.429 --> 15:33.565
<i>After that, I knew
I could never be with you.</i>

15:33.632 --> 15:37.002
<i>Even though the main obstacle
to our marriage was gone,</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:38.671
<i>I knew we could never be</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:41.740
<i>truly intimate
again psychically.</i>

15:41.807 --> 15:44.076
So I took the <i>Y'ellonn,</i>

15:44.143 --> 15:49.448
<i>knowing that Sorcerer-Priests
and Priestesses lead
celibate, solitary lives.</i>

15:52.451 --> 15:55.354
<i>I am deeply, deeply sorry.</i>

16:00.025 --> 16:02.594
<i>She opened
her mind to us fully.</i>

16:02.661 --> 16:04.863
<i>She was telling the truth.</i>

16:04.964 --> 16:07.366
<i>It really was just an accident.</i>

16:07.466 --> 16:09.335
<i>And the King's death
had nothing to do</i>

16:09.435 --> 16:10.970
<i>with the destruction
of the Zeta-Tube</i>

16:11.036 --> 16:13.973
<i>or the communication satellite.</i>

16:14.039 --> 16:16.942
<i>We're sorry
it all turned out this way.</i>

16:17.009 --> 16:18.777
<i>Not as sorry as I.</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:22.381
<i>If I had just been braver,</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:26.618
<i>if I had defied my father,
he would still be alive</i>

16:26.685 --> 16:29.488
<i>and S'yraa and I
would be together.</i>

16:29.555 --> 16:34.660
<i>And the M'hontrrs would not be
taking the woman I love
off to prison.</i>

16:38.130 --> 16:40.132
<i>Did you hear?</i>

16:40.199 --> 16:41.900
<i>A priestess has been arrested
for the death of the King.</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:43.569
<i>They say she used
to be G'arrunn.</i>

16:43.669 --> 16:45.804
<i>It's a ma'al trick.
It has to be!</i>

16:45.871 --> 16:49.475
<i>Only an A'ashenn
would dare kill the king.</i>

16:49.541 --> 16:51.877
<i>No, it is true.</i>

16:51.977 --> 16:54.079
<i>We have an open mind
confession of the crime</i>

16:54.179 --> 16:56.849
<i>from the Priestess
who killed King S'turnn.</i>

17:00.052 --> 17:04.223
<i>My fellow Martians.
Clearly, this is shocking news.</i>

17:04.323 --> 17:06.692
<i>But there is a lesson
to be learned here.</i>

17:06.759 --> 17:13.265
<i>Our king is dead
because the G'arrunn wanted
the life of a B'lahdenn.</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:17.269
<i>For just as there is much even
G'arrunns cannot aspire to,</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:21.407
<i>there is much our A'ashenns
should not aspire to.</i>

17:21.507 --> 17:25.711
<i>This is the reason
our caste system exists,</i>

17:26.545 --> 17:28.614
<i>to preserve order.</i>

17:28.714 --> 17:30.783
<i>It is the Martian way.</i>

17:30.883 --> 17:32.418
<i>R'ess E'dda is right.</i>

17:32.518 --> 17:34.119
<i>The system
is there for a reason.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:35.554
<i>It is
as it has always been.</i>

17:35.621 --> 17:36.622
<i>It is
the Martian way!</i>

17:36.722 --> 17:37.790
<i>Indeed!</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:40.459
<i>This has been the Martian way,</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:43.595
<i>but that does not make it
the right way,</i>

17:43.695 --> 17:47.466
<i>does not mean it is the way
things ought to be.</i>

17:47.566 --> 17:52.905
<i>Our caste system is responsible
for all of M'arzz's problems.</i>

17:52.971 --> 17:54.706
<i>Just think, my people.</i>

17:54.773 --> 17:56.608
<i>How preposterous is it</i>

17:56.708 --> 17:58.944
<i>that among a race
of shape shifters,</i>

17:59.044 --> 18:03.615
<i>the color of one's skin
defines one's worth?</i>

18:03.715 --> 18:05.651
<i>It is long past time</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:09.421
<i>for institutionalized tribalism
and scapegoating</i>

18:09.488 --> 18:12.057
<i>to be eradicated.</i>

18:12.124 --> 18:15.594
<i>The Martian way should be
a path toward empathy,</i>

18:15.661 --> 18:20.966
<i>a path toward embracing
full equality for all Martians.</i>

18:21.066 --> 18:25.270
<i>If we allow
our society, our culture</i>

18:25.337 --> 18:28.240
<i>to hold on to old prejudices,</i>

18:28.307 --> 18:33.278
<i>then we are all to blame
for my father's death.</i>

18:33.345 --> 18:39.151
<i>Together, we must all find
a new way.</i>

18:39.251 --> 18:41.086
<i>He forgets himself.</i>

18:41.153 --> 18:42.588
<i>Heresy!
The Prince
is right.</i>

18:42.654 --> 18:44.123
<i>To dispose of caste...</i>

18:44.189 --> 18:45.757
<i>We must
embrace this now!</i>

18:45.824 --> 18:47.025
<i>Gotta give the Prince credit.</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:48.694
<i>Guy knows how to make a speech.</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:51.029
<i>Stay alert.
Don't forget why we're here.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:55.267
<i>My eyes are opening
to these words of common sense.</i>

18:55.334 --> 18:59.104
<i>This dialogue will continue.
It must.</i>

18:59.171 --> 19:01.373
<i>But enough about death today.</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:04.543
<i>We're here to celebrate
the birth of my son,</i>

19:04.643 --> 19:08.847
<i>your Prince J'emm,
son of S'turnn.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:29.701
<i>Conner,
M'gann and Gar?</i>

19:29.801 --> 19:31.136
<i>I'll take you to them.</i>

19:49.755 --> 19:51.356
<i>The Time Scanner!</i>

19:51.423 --> 19:52.524
<i>He's here.
Hurry!</i>

19:52.591 --> 19:53.725
<i>I'll mask our flight!</i>

20:05.370 --> 20:07.439
<i>There's
someone below us.</i>

20:07.539 --> 20:09.208
<i>I'm picking up
the same mind signature
from the cave-in.</i>

20:09.274 --> 20:11.443
<i>Meaning?
Trouble.</i>

20:19.351 --> 20:20.686
<i>I know
I saw someone...</i>

20:22.020 --> 20:23.589
<i>...doing something with this.</i>

20:23.689 --> 20:25.123
<i>What is it?</i>

20:25.224 --> 20:26.858
<i>It's definitely
Apokoliptan tech.</i>

20:28.026 --> 20:29.595
<i>It's a bomb.</i>

20:29.695 --> 20:32.631
<i>I'm guessing we've only got
minutes before it blows.</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:35.300
<i>It looks like there's some kind
of virus in the containers.</i>

20:36.868 --> 20:38.637
<i>It tastes of M'comm.</i>

20:38.737 --> 20:40.405
<i>You can
say goodbye to Mom</i>

20:40.472 --> 20:42.741
<i>and tell Dad I'm sorry.</i>

20:42.808 --> 20:44.476
<i>M'comm!
This was his plan.</i>

20:44.576 --> 20:46.645
<i>That's why he did what he did
on New Genesis.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:50.549
<i>Trading favors with Apokolips
to get this this viral bomb?</i>

20:50.616 --> 20:53.952
<i>My guess is it'll target
and kill all the G'arrunns
in the arena.</i>

20:54.052 --> 20:56.154
<i>Maybe the B'lahdenns as well
or worse!</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:57.723
<i>We don't know
the explosive yield</i>

20:57.789 --> 20:59.891
<i>or how far the virus
will spread.</i>

20:59.958 --> 21:01.927
<i>You three need
to get out of here.
You're all in danger.</i>

21:01.994 --> 21:03.562
<i>But I'm--
-</i> <i>You're biracial.</i>

21:03.629 --> 21:05.063
<i>We don't know
how it will affect you or Gar.</i>

21:05.130 --> 21:06.565
<i>He has your blood in his veins.</i>

21:06.632 --> 21:08.166
<i>-I'll get rid of it.
Great.</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:09.768
<i>Except you haven't seen
the sun in a while.</i>

21:09.835 --> 21:11.503
<i>Right now you're not
as tough as you think.</i>

21:11.603 --> 21:13.839
<i>It has to be me.
I'm the only one who's immune.</i>

21:13.939 --> 21:16.174
<i>There's a heat source below.
A lava flow, I think.</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:18.310
<i>should be hot enough
to fry the virus.</i>

21:20.312 --> 21:22.247
<i>Now, go! Clear the area!</i>

21:22.314 --> 21:23.849
<i>Be careful, Conner.</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:29.154
<i>I don't see him.</i>

21:29.254 --> 21:31.156
<i>Miss Martian's
blocking my telepathy.</i>

21:31.256 --> 21:32.858
<i>I can't pinpoint any of them.</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:34.626
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

21:34.693 --> 21:37.963
<i>You must evacuate
the arena, now!</i>

21:41.199 --> 21:42.534
<i>J'emm?</i>

21:42.634 --> 21:43.802
<i>M'hontrr,
get the Queen to safety!</i>

21:43.869 --> 21:45.103
<i>At once, Prince J'emm.</i>

22:26.345 --> 22:28.814
<i>No! Oh,
no, no, no, no, no.</i>

22:28.880 --> 22:31.917
<i>Conner!
M'gann, wait!
The virus!</i>

22:37.723 --> 22:39.391
<i>He... He's fine.</i>

22:39.491 --> 22:41.660
<i>He'll pop up any minute now.</i>

22:41.727 --> 22:43.595
<i>The explosion
can't kill super--</i>

22:43.695 --> 22:45.230
<i>I can't feel
his mind-touch.</i>

22:45.330 --> 22:47.265
<i>I can't feel his mind-touch!</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:48.233
<i>M'gann...</i>

22:51.203 --> 22:52.938
<i>No.</i>

22:53.038 --> 22:53.939
<i>Where are they?</i>

22:54.039 --> 22:54.906
<i>Conner?</i>

22:55.006 --> 22:55.774
<i>Down there!</i>

22:59.578 --> 23:01.279
<i>Is...
Is the heat affecting him, too?</i>

23:01.380 --> 23:05.083
<i>No. Kryptonite...
traces in the air.</i>

23:05.183 --> 23:07.252
<i>We all must leave this place.</i>

23:07.352 --> 23:08.887
<i>But Conner...</i>

23:08.954 --> 23:11.089
<i>We all must
leave this place now!</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:20.465
<i>Low oxygen on M'arzz.</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:23.969
<i>Not enough solar energy
to recharge his cells.</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:26.438
<i>A bomb laced with Kryptonite...</i>

23:26.538 --> 23:28.140
<i>And that shadow of ash
on the wall...</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:32.244
<i>Conner...
Please, please answer me.</i>

23:32.310 --> 23:34.880
<i>Conner, please.</i>

23:34.946 --> 23:37.949
<i>Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.</i>

23:44.756 --> 23:46.158
<i>I'm sorry. M'gann.</i>

23:47.392 --> 23:49.928
<i>I'm so, so sorry.</i>
