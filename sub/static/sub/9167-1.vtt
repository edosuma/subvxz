THE FIRST TIME
WE PICKED HIM UP,
IT WAS FOR BREAKING WINDOWS.

YES, AND HE WANTED
TO HIRE A LAWYER.
WE REMEMBER.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO,
RIGHT AFTER YOU GUYS SEPARATED.

RIGHT AFTER WE GOT
OUR DIVORCE, YES.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.929

IS JUST DANNY'S WAY OF--

04:55.963 --> 04:58.031
OF TRYING TO GET US

YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, UH,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.995
THE TRUTH IS,
YOUR MOTHER AND I TRIED HARD
TO MAKE IT WORK OUT,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.464
BUT WE WERE ARGUING
ALL THE TIME.

06:03.497 --> 06:08.035

WELL, YOU KNOW,
DANNY TAKES HIS CUES FROM YOU,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.464
AND I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IF
YOU ASKED RICK TO GO SAILING
WITH YOU GUYS, IT MIGHT--

07:10.498 --> 07:11.965
JESUS, SUSAN.
I MEAN, COME ON.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.503
GIVING HIM A PEP TALK
IS ONE THING, BUT TAKING
YOUR FIANCE SAILING WITH US ?

07:15.536 --> 07:20.040
- COME ON. JEEZ !
- I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.704
YOU OKAY ?
YEAH, YEAH, I'M OKAY.

SUSAN ASKED ME
TO TAKE RICK SAILING
WITH US THIS WEEKEND...

07:53.741 --> 07:56.043
SO DANNY AND HE
CAN BOND.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.848
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
WHAT ?

08:00.881 --> 08:04.151
WELL, DANNY NEEDS
TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT
HIS MOM'S GETTING REMARRIED.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.253
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ACCEPT IT TOO, FRANK.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.657
I-I CAN ACCEPT IT.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
ACCEPTING IT.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.159
I DON'T WANNA
HANG OUT WITH THE GUY,
THAT'S ALL.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.762
SO WHAT REALLY BOTHERS YOU
ABOUT SAILING WITH RICK ?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.930
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT
DANNY MIGHT GET TO LIKE HIM ?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.732
MAYBE I DON'T WANT HIM
BONDING WITH HIM.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.068
MAYBE I DON'T WANT HIM
TO HAVE A NEW DAD.
REMEMBER MY FRIEND ?

08:21.101 --> 08:24.304
HIS EX-WIFE RAN AWAY
WITH-WITH KEITH BARREL,
THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.275
WELL, HIS KID ADMIRED
THE GUY SO MUCH THAT
HE-HE TOOK HIS NAME,

08:28.308 --> 08:30.678
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
STOPPED SEEING HIS REAL DAD
ALTOGETHER.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.013
OH, COME ON, FRANK.
DANNY LOVES YOU.
YOU'RE HIS DAD.

FALLING ALL OVER HIM
JUST 'CAUSE HE'S LOADED.

HE'S GOT MORE
THAN JUST MONEY, FRANK.
YEAH ? WHAT ?

08:42.655 --> 08:44.758
ACCORDING TO EVERYONE,
HE'S A VERY NICE GUY.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.961

SUPPOSEDLY, BUT NO ONE'S
FALLING ALL OVER ME.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.797
YES, YOU ARE.

08:49.830 --> 08:54.735

NEW BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINE.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.011

THE STOCK JUST WENT
THROUGH THE ROOF.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.748
IT WAS LIKE WINNING
THE LOTTERY, BUT--

09:40.781 --> 09:43.851

TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WITH MY LIFE.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.153

AT BEING HIS FRIEND.

WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
THERE'S TWO THINGS
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER WITH A KID.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.965
NUMBER ONE:
YOU GOTTA SHOW HIM
THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.100
NUMBER TWO:
GIVE HIM STUFF.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.969
YOU MEAN BRIBE HIM, RIGHT ?

10:02.002 --> 10:04.972
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU BOUGHT HIM
A NEW BASEBALL GLOVE,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.974
YOU'D BE RIGHT IN WITH HIM.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.976
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044

14:26.599 --> 14:30.137
SHE MUST KNOW SOME
PRETTY GOOD TRICKS TO MAKE
OLD RICK FINALLY SETTLE DOWN.

I HIRED HIM
TO BUILD ME SOME BOATS.
DID HE TELL YOU THAT ?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.169
NO, HE DIDN'T.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.409
IF YOUR DAD'S SUCH
A GREAT BASEBALL PLAYER,

17:22.442 --> 17:25.244
HOW COME HE NEVER TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO THROW A BASEBALL ?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.846
I CAN THROW THE BALL.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.682
THEN WHY ARE YOU
PUTTING THE BALL
EVERYWHERE WHERE I'M NOT ?

17:29.716 --> 17:33.286
WHEN YOU THROW A BASEBALL,
YOU POINT YOUR FOOT TO SOMEBODY
SO THE BALL GOES TO HIM.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.388
- JUST THROW THE BALL.
- I'M GONNA THROW THE BALL.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.424

FOR THE BALL, I DON'T WANNA
JUMP FOR THE BALL.

OF THE BRUSH AS WELL.

WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.154
THAT'S WHAT I ASKED MY DAD,
AND THAT'S WHAT
HE ASKED HIS FATHER.

WHO TOLD YOUR FATHER,
WHO'S TELLING YOU NOW ?
WHAT ?

18:45.925 --> 18:48.728
THAT'S WHY GOD
INVENTED SANDPAPER.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.319
WHY ? BECAUSE HE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY
YOU THREW A BALL ?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.721
NO, HE THREW IT HARD,
AND HE TRIED TO HURT ME.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.558

WAS IT ANY HARDER THAN
A LINE DRIVE COMING AT YA ?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.026
NO.

19:20.059 --> 19:24.264
THEN MAYBE HE WAS JUST
TRYING TO PREPARE YOU FOR
A REAL GAME OR SOMETHING.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.766
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
WORK FOR HIM ANYWAY ?

19:26.799 --> 19:29.602

HIS MONEY. TELL HIM YOU
DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM HIM.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.871
I CAN'T DO THAT.
WHY NOT ?

19:32.972 --> 19:36.409
