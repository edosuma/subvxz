00:29.562 --> 00:31.497
Warden: No.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.433
Tallmadge.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.236
No.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.471
Tallmadge. No.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.175
Samuel.
Samuel Tallmadge.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.512
Rebel officer,
captured at Valcour Island.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.148
- No.
- Aye?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.505
Ah, Tallmadge.
Here he is.

00:52.621 --> 00:53.890
Or was.

00:54.811 --> 00:57.192
Died just before Christmas.

00:58.306 --> 01:01.183
Dysentery, supposedly.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.331
- ( Body splashes )
- Thank you for visiting the Jersey.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.636
Who was his bunkmate?

01:12.672 --> 01:14.373
Bunkmate?

01:14.375 --> 01:18.844
You know what I mean. The
man he talked to the most.

01:18.846 --> 01:22.681
- How should I bloody know...
- Go and find him now

01:22.683 --> 01:25.584
before I heave you
over the side, eh?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.853
( Chuckles )

01:27.855 --> 01:30.456
Go on.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.159
All right.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.863
I spent three years
on a bucket like this.

01:37.865 --> 01:41.633
<i>You make a friend fast
or you die.</i>

01:44.737 --> 01:47.473
A ship like this
brought me over.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.378
They pitched so many
bodies into the sea,

01:53.380 --> 01:55.614
the sharks would
follow us like dogs

01:55.616 --> 01:57.616
- waiting on table scraps.
- ( grunting )

01:59.519 --> 02:02.321
We're the sharks now.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.724
You remember that.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.227
<i>( Chains rattling )</i>

02:09.229 --> 02:13.665
Well, they say
this is the man you want.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.240
You knew Samuel Tallmadge?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.776
Huh?

02:24.778 --> 02:27.846
Hey, what's your name?

02:29.182 --> 02:31.383
Hmm?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.685
Where are you from?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.756
( Whispers ) Setauket.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.892
What?

02:39.894 --> 02:41.560
( Louder ) Setauket.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.694
Setauket?

02:42.696 --> 02:46.565
<i>Where the Tallmadge boys roam.</i>

02:46.567 --> 02:50.836
So, you and Sam
were kindred or kin?

02:50.838 --> 02:54.273
<i>- What's his name?
- Jordan: Major.</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:00.946
I can tell you who this man be.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.590
<i>â™ª Hush, hush</i>

03:11.592 --> 03:13.392
<i>â™ª There's snakes
in the garden â™ª</i>

03:13.394 --> 03:17.229
<i>â™ª Soul for sale</i>

03:17.231 --> 03:19.731
<i>â™ª Blood on the rise</i>

03:21.401 --> 03:23.602
<i>â™ª Hush, hush</i>

03:23.604 --> 03:29.408
<i>- â™ª I can't wait anymore
- â™ª Soul for sale</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:33.312
<i>â™ª I can't wait anymore</i>

03:35.415 --> 03:38.750
<i>â™ª Hush, hush.</i>

03:41.754 --> 03:43.889
<i>( bird caws )</i>

03:43.891 --> 03:45.924
<i>( door creaks open )</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:50.462
<i>( rocking chair creaking )</i>

03:51.831 --> 03:54.900
<i>( creaking continues )</i>

03:57.770 --> 04:00.606
( gasps )

04:00.608 --> 04:02.374
Hey, Woody.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.709
You got any breakfast here?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.377
Oh, you bastard.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.778
<i>- Bastard!
- All right.</i>

04:06.780 --> 04:09.514
What are you doing here?
This is my home!

04:09.516 --> 04:13.719
Aye, and a fine little home
it is, albeit a bit lonely.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.821
And you are aware
that the soldier

04:15.823 --> 04:17.488
who is quartered here
will be back soon.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.625
Well, we'd better
eat quick, then.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.331
It's fine silver.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.867
I'll get you a good price for it
across the Sound, if you like.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.603
Give me that. We're supposed
to meet in the cove.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.006
Yeah, and you're supposed
to hang a petticoat.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.608
When I'm ready with the intelligence.
That was the plan.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.543
When you're ready?
It's been two months

04:38.545 --> 04:40.812
<i>since you passed on that little
morsel about sauerkraut.</i>

04:40.814 --> 04:42.547
I've been having trouble
getting into the city

04:42.549 --> 04:45.684
without raising
suspicions, all right?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.886
It's not as easy
for me as you'd think.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.389
<i>Caleb: No one thinks it is easy.</i>

04:50.391 --> 04:52.791
<i>But this is about
more than just you.</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:03.869
- What's this?
- That is your new Bible.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.040
<i>It's a code dictionary.</i>

05:08.042 --> 05:09.775
<i>Makes sure that anything
that you write</i>

05:09.777 --> 05:12.611
<i>can't be read by the enemy.
In case of intercept.</i>

05:12.613 --> 05:14.980
Each word has its own number.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.050
Ben chose the words
he thought we'd use most.

05:18.052 --> 05:19.951
Now, look.

05:21.587 --> 05:26.491
Here, 722.
That's you.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.761
721 is Benny boy.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.397
725, yours truly.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.732
Yeah, but hang on a sec.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.769
Look, 722 says here
Samuel Culper.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.871
Culpepper. Yeah?

05:39.873 --> 05:42.874
That's your alias, all right?

05:42.876 --> 05:46.078
It's the only name we use for
you back at headquarters.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.480
Woodhull does not exist.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.882
Culpepper.
Culpeh-per.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.017
Cul-pepper.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.753
Peeper, Piper, Pepper.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.421
I hate it.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.358
Well, Washington
picked that one.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.893
And Ben picked Samuel
on account of his brother.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.896
Washing... Washington?
General Washington?

06:04.898 --> 06:08.934
That's right.
Old 711 himself.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.443
"Mercy, Moment,

06:18.445 --> 06:20.912
Murder, Measure."

06:20.914 --> 06:23.515
I'm not gonna
remember all this.

06:24.484 --> 06:27.953
That's why you keep
the book hidden.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.590
<i>Now, when can I tell them
you're heading back</i>

06:31.592 --> 06:33.925
<i>to British headquarters?</i>

06:35.728 --> 06:38.697
This draft note confirms
that I gave half my hay

06:38.699 --> 06:40.532
to the King's Army
on October 12th.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.434
But Colonel Beecham
will not accept it

06:42.436 --> 06:43.902
in exchange for new seed.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.470
<i>Hewlett:
Nor should he.</i>

06:45.472 --> 06:46.972
<i>Colonel Beecham
is the land commissary.</i>

06:46.974 --> 06:49.541
That certificate
is meant for Captain Dodd.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.476
<i>Richard: Dodd will
convert that note,</i>

06:51.478 --> 06:53.612
but you need to get Faro and
Harborough to sign off.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.615
- Yes, but...
- Next in line, please.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.654
State your name and your case.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.756
Anna Strong to seek parole
for my husband, Selah Strong.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.758
<i>Richard: On what grounds
do you seek parole?</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:09.428
It has been four months since he
has been remanded to the Jersey

07:09.430 --> 07:11.830
and still no evidence has been
brought forward against him.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.699
We have several witness
accounts of a petition

07:14.701 --> 07:18.103
naming your husband as
delegate to an illegal body

07:18.105 --> 07:21.106
known as the New York
Provincial Congress.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.575
Counsel recommends
no parole at this time.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.043
Next in line!

07:25.045 --> 07:27.712
Major, please. You are a man of honor.
I beg you, listen.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.181
Madam, you will address
the magistrate.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.217
Unless this so-called
petition is produced,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.119
the charge against
my husband is hearsay.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.855
<i>Richard: Selah Strong
confessed to insurrection.</i>

07:36.857 --> 07:38.557
You forced him to confess

07:38.559 --> 07:40.025
so you could
lay claim to our land

07:40.027 --> 07:42.093
and sell it off piece by
piece to your friends.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.829
Mrs. Strong.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.097
( Quietly )
You forget yourself.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.606
<i>Woman: Patriot princess. How
the mighty have fallen.</i>

07:54.608 --> 07:56.141
Well, now I will charge her...

07:56.143 --> 07:58.543
Richard.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.111
Let's continue, shall we?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.053
<i>Rogers:
So, Selah Strong.</i>

08:08.055 --> 08:10.822
You knew Samuel Tallmadge
very well?

08:10.824 --> 08:13.692
All my life.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.862
And his brother Benjamin?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.032
Well, I have to tell you,

08:21.034 --> 08:22.501
I've been to your little town

08:22.503 --> 08:25.904
and I've met
your lovely wife, Anna.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.708
Poor woman has been pining after
ya, ain't that right, Jordan?

08:29.710 --> 08:33.712
Yes, every week she asks the
king's head man to release you.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.181
You've got many friends

08:36.183 --> 08:39.985
who are very anxious
to see your bondage end.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.687
Friends who pay men like me

08:42.688 --> 08:45.891
to get men like you
out of places like this.

08:45.893 --> 08:49.928
So, what do you say,
Mr. Strong?

08:49.930 --> 08:53.632
Would you like to go home?

09:12.118 --> 09:13.685
Mrs. Strong?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.687
I'm closing up for the night.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.623
Mr. DeJong asks I send the rum
down to the cellar at 10:00.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.258
No, that's fine.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.195
I've come to deliver this,
courtesy of Major Hewlett.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.798
It came tonight via dispatch
rider from New York.

09:30.202 --> 09:34.306
<i>A Major John Andre sent it for
the child of his housemaid,</i>

09:34.308 --> 09:36.775
who Major Hewlett remembered is in
your care and asked me to bring...

09:36.777 --> 09:38.677
Cicero!

09:40.846 --> 09:42.614
I'm almost done folding, miss.

09:42.616 --> 09:46.217
Look, it's a birthday
gift from your mother.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.957
Look what she made.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.903
Mr. Baker.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.373
<i>Baker: Ahem.</i>

10:09.675 --> 10:11.743
Ma'am.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.783
<i>( Door closes )</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:20.719
<i>( dishes clatter )</i>

10:20.721 --> 10:22.687
- Anna, I need a word.
- We're closed.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.322
Tomorrow, then, all right?
Somewhere private. Our tree or...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.024
This is where I work now,

10:26.026 --> 10:29.761
at the tavern I was forced
to sell to Maarten DeJong.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.797
And tomorrow he expects
me to work all day.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.066
I'm going to New York
to sell your crop.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.106
The cauliflower, all of it.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.108
( Cup clatters )

10:43.110 --> 10:46.011
( snoring )

10:49.215 --> 10:52.183
Are you saying this to hurt me?

10:52.185 --> 10:55.787
( Quietly ) It's to
hurt them, all right?

10:55.789 --> 10:59.424
<i>Listen to me, I need... I
need you to ride with me.</i>

11:00.326 --> 11:02.293
I need you to...

11:04.664 --> 11:07.799
I need you to pose as...

11:07.801 --> 11:11.269
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.772
So you can sell off the last
of my husband's estate?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.240
No, it's the only way
into the city, all right?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.342
- I can't ask Mary.
- Excuse me, Miss Anna?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.378
I think this is for you.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.229
Anna, what is this?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.165
<i>What is this?</i>

11:40.167 --> 11:42.967
Anna, I don't understand.
What is this?

11:42.969 --> 11:45.136
I told you, Abigail promised to
keep an eye out in New York.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.938
No, no, I mean
I don't understand

11:46.940 --> 11:48.973
how is Simcoe still alive?

11:48.975 --> 11:52.143
- You told me that he was...
- Dead.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.715
Caleb Brewster.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.416
I am gonna kill him.
That lying...

11:58.418 --> 12:01.019
Caleb didn't lie to you, I did.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.992
He and Ben took Simcoe captive,

12:07.994 --> 12:12.263
but Simcoe got freed somehow.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.736
And so you lied to me

12:17.738 --> 12:21.339
so that I would stay the
course for the cause.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.441
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.849
Come tomorrow, we'll both be.

12:50.035 --> 12:53.171
<i>( Seagulls squawking )</i>

13:08.854 --> 13:12.290
Captain Simcoe!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.325
Welcome back
to Setauket, Captain.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.294
We're glad to have you.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.864
Major Hewlett apologizes that he
couldn't be here in person to greet you.

13:19.866 --> 13:23.234
But he asks that you proceed to
Whitehall and give your report.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.944
Conspiracy?

13:32.946 --> 13:34.946
<i>Simcoe:
I'm afraid so.</i>

13:34.948 --> 13:38.817
Whilst enduring torture at the
hands of my rebel captors,

13:38.819 --> 13:42.987
I managed to wheedle out the fact that
they hailed from Setauket itself.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.089
<i>- Setauket?
- By your leave,</i>

13:45.091 --> 13:47.826
I'd like to conduct an inquiry

13:47.828 --> 13:50.328
beginning with the family names

13:50.330 --> 13:53.398
of Tallmadge and Brewster.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.135
Yes, very well.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.471
But tread lightly.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.340
Lightly?

14:02.342 --> 14:06.010
The tactics which we employed
on our first days here

14:06.012 --> 14:08.513
are no longer to be tolerated.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.450
We must show these people that
we are better than the rebels.

14:12.452 --> 14:16.988
We must win the battle
for their hearts and minds.

14:21.293 --> 14:22.627
<i>I intend to.</i>

14:22.629 --> 14:25.363
Believe me.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.655
Mm.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.557
Mrs. Woodhull.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.926
Mr. Baker.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.427
Is... is my
husband here?

14:56.429 --> 15:00.398
Uh, no.
I haven't... he's not.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.440
Whose silver is this?

15:10.509 --> 15:13.044
Uh, I believe...

15:13.046 --> 15:15.413
I believe it was a gift
for the household.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.549
A gift? From whom?

15:22.521 --> 15:25.056
Mrs. Strong.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.033
She was here?

15:36.535 --> 15:38.503
You saw her here?

15:39.471 --> 15:42.040
With Mr. Woodhull?

15:43.409 --> 15:46.544
I... at the Epiphany.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.080
I came in one night.

15:49.082 --> 15:52.116
They were here.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.732
<i>I'm sorry, I...</i>

16:17.309 --> 16:19.210
<i>( door closes )</i>

16:19.212 --> 16:21.546
( clatters )

16:21.548 --> 16:23.982
Stupid man.
Stupid.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.249
Come here.

16:25.251 --> 16:29.320
What did you say
to distress Mrs. Woodhull?

16:29.322 --> 16:33.458
Please tell me, Ensign Baker.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.095
<i>( Pub patrons chattering )</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:44.335
- ( gasps )
- Don't scream, it's just me. It's Abe.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.637
( Panting )

16:48.707 --> 16:51.042
( quietly ) I thought
you were Simcoe.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.410
( Quietly ) Has he come by yet?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.146
- No.
- Well, he will.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.548
Tomorrow...
tomorrow he will.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.617
- Soldiers at supper said they saw him.
- Yeah?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.552
He had to report
to Hewlett first.

17:01.554 --> 17:06.089
Abe, if Simcoe at all
puts together

17:06.092 --> 17:09.359
a suspicion about
what led to the ambush,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.230
maybe you should flee now while
you still have a chance.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.365
Flee?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.233
Leave Long Island?
And do what? Go where?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.736
- I don't know.
- What about my family?

17:20.439 --> 17:22.073
What about you?

17:22.075 --> 17:23.374
I...

17:23.376 --> 17:25.510
- What about Mr. Culper?
- Who?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.678
<i>- ( Thuds ) More ale, please!
- I have to go.</i>

17:27.680 --> 17:30.081
Anna.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.250
Anna, wait, wait.
Listen.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.353
I say we finish the job
Caleb promised he'd do.

17:35.355 --> 17:39.123
A simple note could
lure him out at night.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.060
And then a robbery on the road.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.729
I have seen how an explosive
can be used to set a trap.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.697
Maybe if we...
if we both work

17:46.699 --> 17:49.267
together, we can...
we can do this.

17:49.269 --> 17:53.204
Abraham, you've never
killed anyone.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.405
What else...

17:54.407 --> 17:56.507
And you're not about
to start now.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.479
Go.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.716
<i>( Anna ascends stairs )</i>

18:16.295 --> 18:17.795
Father?

18:19.398 --> 18:21.299
Are you too busy
for a kiss good night?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.767
No, no, no.

18:22.769 --> 18:27.238
You're rescuing me from the
drudgery of my ledgers.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.873
Hmm.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.509
Good night, my little soldier.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.778
( Kisses )

18:33.780 --> 18:36.848
I do like it when
you call me Father.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.484
I think of you that way.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.694
Anything I can do to improve
your comfort while you're here?

18:55.667 --> 18:59.270
Can you convince the major to
grant Selah Strong a pardon?

18:59.272 --> 19:02.473
<i>To release him from prison?</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:04.242
I can no longer
be blind to the fact

19:04.244 --> 19:06.911
of Abraham's feelings
for Anna Strong.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.914
Was it true that they
were engaged to be wed?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.450
- Who told you that?
- Is it true?

19:12.452 --> 19:15.620
<i>Were they engaged before
Abraham was obliged...</i>

19:15.622 --> 19:18.222
Abraham was not obliged.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.158
He loves you.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.761
Anna Strong was
a childish infatuation.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.264
You are his wife.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.338
All wives want to be
with their husbands.

19:35.841 --> 19:41.312
Perhaps if Anna can be reunited
with hers, then I can be with mine.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.249
I know that there are legal
and business concerns,

19:45.251 --> 19:49.287
but please... please just
think on it, Father.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.457
That's all I ask.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.756
<i>Simcoe:
Evening, Woodhull!</i>

20:36.735 --> 20:41.239
Came by your home today
to offer you an apology.

20:42.341 --> 20:46.777
Now it seems
I must retract it with vigor.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.385
- Captain Simcoe.
- Hmm?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.520
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

20:56.522 --> 20:57.521
Well...

20:57.523 --> 20:58.923
( grunts )

20:58.925 --> 21:00.625
Far from it, actually.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.328
Time for redemption,
Mr. Woodhull.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.464
Wait, wait, wait.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.932
No, wait, wait.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.533
Okay.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.935
If you have
a grievance with me,

21:10.937 --> 21:12.670
I suggest that we
settle this lawfully

21:12.672 --> 21:14.405
with Major Hewlett, all right?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.773
We'll settle it now.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.043
( Yells, gasping )

21:21.713 --> 21:23.614
( laughing )

21:23.616 --> 21:26.484
You prefer to strike
at the wound, don't you?

21:26.486 --> 21:30.554
That explains why you forced
yourself on her at Christmas.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.823
- What?
- When her spirits were low.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.826
Ow!

21:35.828 --> 21:38.462
( Choking )

21:39.998 --> 21:42.466
( grunting )

21:44.503 --> 21:47.872
Mr. Woodhull!
Mr. Woodhull!

21:47.874 --> 21:49.640
Mr. Woodhull.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.610
Apologies, Captain.
Direct order from the major.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.346
Your father's looking for you.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.847
It's an emergency.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.450
I have to bring Mr. Woodhull
to the magistrate away...

21:59.452 --> 22:01.585
er, straightaway.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.391
Emergency?

22:07.393 --> 22:09.727
Isn't that what you'd call it?

22:09.729 --> 22:12.029
He attacked me first.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.465
You all saw that.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.833
Yes?

22:15.835 --> 22:18.836
Saw what, sir?

22:25.644 --> 22:28.012
<i>Caleb: There's definitely something
going on between those two.</i>

22:28.014 --> 22:30.748
I just don't know what.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.519
You know, when I suggested
that he take Anna to New York

22:35.521 --> 22:37.688
to get past the checkpoint,

22:37.690 --> 22:39.490
he got very upset.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.893
Anyway, I suppose
none of this is our concern.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.895
They're my only two agents
on Long Island.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.498
If there's trouble between
them, I want to know about it.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.034
Well, how's about you jump
on a whaleboat with me, Major?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.403
Get your arse
out of this woodpile?

22:52.405 --> 22:54.038
( Sighs ) I'd like to.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.541
Washington needs me here.
Compiling.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.377
That and there's
Sackett's homework...

22:59.379 --> 23:01.078
tradecraft, as he calls it.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.114
I feel like I'm back
in school again.

23:03.116 --> 23:06.417
Yeah? See, this is
exactly the reason why

23:06.419 --> 23:08.452
I've been careful
to avoid success.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.653
( Chuckles )

23:09.655 --> 23:12.156
- Sir?
- "Sir," he says.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.525
I have an urgent report
from the provost marshal.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.428
He thought perhaps you'd like to see
the latest prisoner exchange proposal.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.797
Thank you, Corporal.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.806
- What is it?
- Samuel.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.542
It's Samuel.
He's alive.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.877
He's being released.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.712
<i>( Caleb laughs )</i>

23:34.714 --> 23:37.481
Sammy boy!
Huh? Huh?

23:37.483 --> 23:39.016
When do we go get him?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.818
I...
( sighs )

23:40.820 --> 23:42.720
oh, I have to report
to Washington tomorrow.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.655
Oh, come on. He'll
release you for this.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.524
No, he won't.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.426
He'd consider it
special treatment.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.428
There are other men's
brothers on that list.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.563
All right.
Well, I'll pick him up.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.965
Yeah, I'll go and get Samuel

23:54.967 --> 23:57.101
and then I'll bring him
back straight here.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.836
Actually, I'll get him
drunk first.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.772
No, I'll get him drunk
and then I'll get him a screw.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.940
Wait, Caleb.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.842
Yeah?

24:05.977 --> 24:07.511
Thank you.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.848
Hey, what are
brothers for, right?

24:14.519 --> 24:16.086
( Sighs )

24:22.594 --> 24:24.728
Captain Simcoe.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.834
Step forward.

24:34.005 --> 24:37.975
Mr. Woodhull,
what are you doing here?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.877
The law requires it.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.681
<i>Hewlett: I had hoped my words
to you had been clear...</i>

24:43.683 --> 24:46.050
respect one's host.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.154
<i>Simcoe: I agree.</i>

24:50.156 --> 24:52.122
Then I learned
from Ensign Baker

24:52.124 --> 24:55.559
that Mr. Woodhull had assaulted
the virtue of a lady...

24:55.561 --> 24:57.761
Mrs. Anna Strong.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.935
I assume you
divulged that, too.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.140
- It was...
- Yes?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.978
What I saw between
Mr. Woodhull and Mrs. Strong

25:13.980 --> 25:16.847
was entirely inappropriate,

25:16.849 --> 25:19.250
and I told him
as much at the time.

25:19.252 --> 25:21.719
But he did not rape her.

25:24.155 --> 25:29.193
So far as I could tell,
the dalliance was consensual.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.599
He must've initiated it, then.

25:35.601 --> 25:36.800
It was not against her wishes.

25:36.802 --> 25:40.671
- This is shameful.
- Yes.

25:42.007 --> 25:46.210
Major, abuse of any kind

25:46.212 --> 25:48.279
<i>is abhorrent to me,</i>

25:48.281 --> 25:51.015
<i>and when I heard
of a lady in distress,</i>

25:51.017 --> 25:52.583
I leapt to her defense.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.786
<i>It now appears
I may have been rash.</i>

25:55.788 --> 25:57.087
Appears?

25:57.089 --> 25:59.657
And if that is the case,

25:59.659 --> 26:03.327
I apologize sincerely
to Mr. Woodhull.

26:07.699 --> 26:10.768
It appears that neither
is in the right or the wrong.

26:10.770 --> 26:14.572
This has all been a terrible
misunderstanding, Richard.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.207
<i>I'm sure we can agree</i>

26:17.209 --> 26:20.578
to make an exception
in this case

26:20.580 --> 26:24.148
<i>as long as Abraham
accepts the apology.</i>

26:24.150 --> 26:25.716
Now, shake on it.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.380
Woodhull!

26:56.382 --> 26:58.148
Wait!

27:02.887 --> 27:05.155
Are you satisfied?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.828
Neither am I...

27:10.830 --> 27:13.998
which is why I propose
we settle this decisively.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.899
What's between us
cannot be settled.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.102
Of course, it can.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.404
With a duel.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.174
- A duel?
- Between gentlemen.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.677
Two pistols.
Somewhere private.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.012
Choose Baker as your second

27:28.014 --> 27:29.913
and I'll select the most
discreet man I know.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.783
- Yeah, I know what a duel is.
- Of course you do.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.252
Or shall you
run and tell Father?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.292
Or shall you
pretend to manhood?

27:42.294 --> 27:45.429
( Whispers )
You know I'll never stop.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.233
I accept.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.074
Apology accepted.

28:04.716 --> 28:08.185
<i>( Singing drunkenly )</i>

28:32.243 --> 28:34.978
Ale, please.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.150
Captain Simcoe.

28:42.987 --> 28:45.122
Let me fetch it.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.423
( Singing continues )

28:50.895 --> 28:53.831
( breathing heavily )

28:55.734 --> 28:58.869
<i>- Simcoe: I apologize, Mrs. Strong, for my tardiness.
- ( gasps )</i>

28:58.871 --> 29:02.306
I suppose it's too late
to pick up my laundry?

29:06.478 --> 29:08.746
You don't remember?

29:10.882 --> 29:13.117
I feared we would
never see you again.

29:13.119 --> 29:16.186
I always knew I'd see you.

29:16.188 --> 29:20.190
<i>In fact, I could never have
endured such ill treatment</i>

29:20.192 --> 29:22.359
<i>had I not clung onto
the hope of one day</i>

29:22.361 --> 29:26.530
resuming our close
friendship we embarked upon.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.503
I'm so relieved...

29:32.505 --> 29:35.272
to hear of your survival.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.180
And...

29:44.249 --> 29:47.050
now that you've returned...

29:50.188 --> 29:52.456
there's something

29:52.458 --> 29:54.992
I've been meaning
to discuss with you.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.927
Oh?

29:58.429 --> 30:02.132
My husband's imprisonment

30:02.134 --> 30:04.535
has cost me

30:04.537 --> 30:07.137
Strong Manor,

30:07.139 --> 30:12.109
this tavern,
and my status in the town.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.077
And yet...

30:15.213 --> 30:20.117
there's something
I cling to, as you did.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.355
My honor.

30:30.361 --> 30:33.597
And while I remain
a married woman,

30:33.599 --> 30:37.501
I ask your help
safeguarding it.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.373
Absolutely.

30:46.444 --> 30:51.381
Tomorrow at dawn
at the millpond,

30:51.383 --> 30:54.952
I intend to avenge it.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.189
You no longer need to worry

30:59.191 --> 31:02.426
about unwelcome advances
from inebriated farmers.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.628
I'll see to that.

31:16.574 --> 31:18.976
Abe!

31:22.180 --> 31:25.015
Luke!

31:25.017 --> 31:26.617
Jeremiah!

31:26.619 --> 31:28.085
Mrs. Anna.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.420
Luke, I can't find Abraham.
Where is he?

31:30.422 --> 31:33.290
- I thought him home.
- No, no one's home.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.225
No one's answering the door
and his horse is gone.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.593
Did he say he
was going anywhere?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.161
No.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.498
He was shooting.

31:44.102 --> 31:46.570
On that old scarecrow
over there.

31:46.572 --> 31:50.140
Taking shots with some old
rusty pistol he had.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.510
Don't think he hit it, though.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.345
Maybe that's why he mad.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.547
No.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.390
<i>( Footsteps descending stairs )</i>

32:06.392 --> 32:09.026
Judge Woodhull, I'm sorry
to barge in at this hour,

32:09.028 --> 32:10.494
but I desperately
need your help.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.063
- It's taken care of.
- It is?

32:13.065 --> 32:14.665
After conferring
with Major Hewlett,

32:14.667 --> 32:16.466
who is also sympathetic
to your plight,

32:16.468 --> 32:19.202
we have agreed to pardon
your husband on one condition.

32:19.204 --> 32:21.405
That he signs an agreement
not to challenge

32:21.407 --> 32:24.608
the attainder
following his release.

32:24.610 --> 32:28.378
Yes, yes, and you
will make sure he signs it.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.080
No, no, that's not
why I'm here.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.015
You need to get dressed.
I'll explain on the way.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.351
You'll explain it right now.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.487
Your son has made
a terrible mistake

32:37.489 --> 32:41.191
and unless you hurry, he's going
to pay for it with his life.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.677
Should you lose
the coin toss, remember,

33:00.679 --> 33:02.713
it is not considered
cowardly to turn aside

33:02.715 --> 33:05.182
to present your adversary
with a smaller target.

33:05.184 --> 33:08.085
That is perhaps the best way
to think of the captain...

33:08.087 --> 33:10.253
as merely a target.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.609
I know you must be concerned
about killing a man

33:32.611 --> 33:34.378
<i>for the first time today.</i>

33:34.380 --> 33:38.148
Let me reassure you.
It's very unlikely to happen.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.386
Well, there's
a first for everything.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.287
Indeed.

33:46.624 --> 33:50.594
Baker: Agree to these conditions
on your personal honor,

33:50.596 --> 33:52.629
before your respective seconds,

33:52.631 --> 33:55.298
before one another,
and before God.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.300
Get on with it, man.

34:02.807 --> 34:06.143
The obverse side
represents Mr. Woodhull.

34:09.447 --> 34:13.350
The reverse his challenger,
Captain Simcoe.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.201
Soldier:
Congratulations.

34:31.203 --> 34:35.338
Mr. Woodhull, you will have the
opportunity to draw first blood.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.612
She's mine.

35:17.248 --> 35:19.783
<i>Baker:
Commence.</i>

35:19.785 --> 35:24.654
One, two, three, four, five.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.490
<i>Turn!</i>

35:37.768 --> 35:39.703
<i>Ready?</i>

35:44.442 --> 35:46.510
<i>Fire, Mr. Woodhull.</i>

35:50.414 --> 35:52.816
( clicks )

36:24.715 --> 36:26.816
My turn.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.965
I want you to know, Woodhull,

36:41.967 --> 36:44.601
that whilst I've killed
many such as you...

36:44.603 --> 36:47.737
( clicks )

36:47.739 --> 36:50.440
...I shall treasure
this particular encounter.

36:53.277 --> 36:55.879
Of course, I may

36:55.881 --> 36:58.481
just decide

36:58.483 --> 37:00.350
to cripple you.

37:08.593 --> 37:11.361
<i>Richard:
Abraham!</i>

37:11.363 --> 37:13.797
What do you think you're doing?

37:13.799 --> 37:15.865
This doesn't concern you!

37:18.669 --> 37:20.370
Do it.

37:21.439 --> 37:23.573
Sir, I can't let you interfere.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.242
Mr. Woodhull
has had his shot.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.345
- This is an affair of honor.
- Whose honor? Mine?

37:28.347 --> 37:30.547
Because I assure you,
it is not my honor

37:30.549 --> 37:32.649
that has been offended here.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.585
It seems far more likely
that it is your own honor...

37:35.587 --> 37:39.256
yours and yours, sirs,
that is at stake here.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.024
I am prepared
to receive your fire.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.894
Please, John.

37:46.397 --> 37:49.899
As I told you, I'm a married
woman before the law.

37:50.901 --> 37:54.804
What happened at Christmas
was a mistake...

37:55.806 --> 37:57.974
for which
we were both at fault.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.278
<i>I swear, sir. There is
nothing between us.</i>

38:01.280 --> 38:03.346
It is over.

38:03.348 --> 38:06.049
<i>We have both
returned to our vows</i>

38:06.051 --> 38:10.287
until fate
determines otherwise.

38:10.289 --> 38:13.323
Fate?

38:13.325 --> 38:16.760
No one knows
what the future may bring.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.361
But if you go through
with this now,

38:18.363 --> 38:21.531
I don't know what
our fate here can be.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.478
<i>( Anna breathing heavily )</i>

38:35.480 --> 38:37.714
I have satisfaction.

38:42.586 --> 38:45.588
<i>Abe:
Reload, please.</i>

38:51.696 --> 38:54.331
Reload!

38:59.870 --> 39:03.073
Mr. Woodhull, you can stop
now with your honor intact.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.441
Just load the pistol.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.042
- Mr. Woodhull...
- Load the pistol.

39:07.611 --> 39:08.878
This is illegal!

39:08.880 --> 39:10.747
Hold him!
Hold him!

39:10.749 --> 39:12.649
Abraham, come to your senses!

39:12.651 --> 39:15.819
This is my battle.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.420
I don't need your protection.

39:17.422 --> 39:20.390
Protection?
I will show you no mercy!

39:20.392 --> 39:24.394
<i>If by some miracle you succeed in
wounding or killing this officer,</i>

39:24.396 --> 39:26.496
<i>I will personally prosecute you</i>

39:26.498 --> 39:29.032
<i>to the full extent
of His Majesty's law!</i>

39:29.934 --> 39:31.768
( cocks gun )

39:31.770 --> 39:33.770
Abraham, don't throw
your life away.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.710
If not for me,
then for your wife,

39:40.712 --> 39:42.379
your son!

39:43.881 --> 39:46.649
This is about more than you!

40:34.932 --> 40:39.469
Hey, ain't Rangers
supposed to range?

40:39.471 --> 40:41.004
On the back of a horse, say?

40:41.006 --> 40:43.706
Best if nobody hears us coming.

40:43.708 --> 40:47.544
Especially our good friend,
Benjamin Tallmadge.

40:50.214 --> 40:54.017
( Whistling )

41:08.499 --> 41:10.834
- Ready?
- Yeah.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.673
We're off to New York
to free Selah.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.842
It seems possible that you
could manage a smile.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.544
After I convince him
to sign away his property.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.913
Is that why you're upset?

41:25.216 --> 41:28.117
You should've killed Simcoe
when you had the chance.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.021
You were the one that was
trying to talk me out of it.

41:32.023 --> 41:35.925
That was to save you. Then
Simcoe gave you an opening.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.037
You heard my father.
He would've prosecuted me.

41:48.039 --> 41:51.508
( Scoffs ) You can't tell
a bluff when you hear it?

41:52.977 --> 41:56.179
Your father would've done
everything he could to protect you.

41:56.181 --> 41:59.816
Simcoe made the challenge, so the
blame would've fallen on him.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.018
( Sighs )

42:03.721 --> 42:06.189
This is business we're about.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.191
So let's get about it.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.700
She's off
to retrieve her husband

42:17.702 --> 42:20.103
and he's off to sell
the rest of their crop.

42:20.105 --> 42:23.907
Trust me, there's no love
lost between those two.

42:33.684 --> 42:36.319
