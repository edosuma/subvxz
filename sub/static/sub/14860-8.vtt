when your period's coming.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.889
| get it.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.770
| guess, uh, uh,
that the fireplace...

08:02.065 --> 08:03.351
The fireplace
is too LaBeouf-y.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.517
Okay, so we
are forging on.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.276
| will find you
the perfect place,

08:08.571 --> 08:10.653
or my name is not Suzanne
Thomson-Perez-Kline-Jensen.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.405
Got to ask. Are those
three hyphens?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.404
Four, actually.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.660
Uh, Thom-Sun, two names.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.946
| was married to a Korean
guy for a hot minute. Yeah.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.785
His hobby was
smoking indoors.

08:21.084 --> 08:21.915
Hmm.
What?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.371
Okay! Let's move on!

08:23.670 --> 08:24.159
Ready. (LAUGHS)
Okay.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.667
(SIGHS) I don't know, Max.

08:27.966 --> 08:28.751
| don't think
we should be here.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.666
Dude, these drunks
know how to do it,

08:30.969 --> 08:33.131
plus everyone
loved my speech.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.841
Thanks for sharing that story
about your dad and the ice tray.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.381
No. thank you, man.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.674
Every day's a gift.
Mmm-hmm.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.183
| just wish this coffee
was a beer, huh?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.092
Hmm.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.642
Yeah.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.272
Dude, I don't even want
any of this stuff.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.354
| asked for a healthy lunch.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.189
Okay. This one was
for me. You're next.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.151
Thanks for sharing that story
about your dad and the ice tray.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.240
Every day's a gift.
Yeah.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.279
Just wish this coffee
was a pizza, huh?

09:00.999 --> 09:02.034
Hmm. Yeah.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.831
Should we do one more? Yeah.
Yeah. Let's do one more.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.748
(ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING)

09:11.051 --> 09:13.133
Thanks for sharing that story
about your dad and the ice tray.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.465
Just wish this coffee
was a vagina, am I right?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.302
Penny, this is about
more than just a car.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.217
Okay? This is
about your life.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.055
You control
your own destiny,

09:23.354 --> 09:25.220
like Katniss Everdeen
in The Hunger Games.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.434
Oh, my god. I love those
books. You read them, too?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.475
No, that stuff's for dorks,
but I knew it'd get you excited.

09:29.778 --> 09:30.643
Oh.
Okay.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.481
It is time for

09:34.115 --> 09:35.856
the walkout.
(WHISPERS) The walkout?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.490
(NORMAL VOICE)
When Guy comes over,

09:37.786 --> 09:38.821
| want you to look
him right in the eye,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.986
and I want you
to say to him,

09:41.289 --> 09:42.199
"What's your
best price?"

09:42.499 --> 09:44.160
And when he
gives it to you,

09:44.459 --> 09:46.996
| want you to say,
"No, thank you."

09:47.295 --> 09:49.377
And then I want you
to just calmly walk out.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.084
Can you do that?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.589
Yes. Yes, I can.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.176
So, ladies.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.009
(STILTED VOICE)
What is your best price?

10:00.308 --> 10:01.173
Did you want the two door
or the four door...

10:01.476 --> 10:02.090
No, thank you!

10:03.269 --> 10:04.384
(PEOPLE GASP)

10:06.189 --> 10:07.145
I'm okay!

10:07.774 --> 10:09.856
(PANTS)

10:10.151 --> 10:10.686
We're not
paying for that.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.980
This place has
all the things you want

10:17.283 --> 10:19.069
that the last five
places didn't have.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.702
Skylights, gym,

10:21.996 --> 10:24.829
close to a hardware store,
but far from a software store.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.332
This chandelier's gonna
make it tough for chicken fights.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.412
Do you guys have
a lot of chicken fights?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.872
(BLOWS) Enough that
it's a real concern.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.377
Yeah. Ready?

10:31.673 --> 10:32.208
(GRUNTS)
ALEX: Whoo!

10:32.507 --> 10:33.997
You know what?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.257
You know what?
This is, this is my fault.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.794
| never asked you guys
about yourselves.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.383
How can I be expected
to find you the perfect place

10:40.682 --> 10:42.264
if I don't know
your story?

10:42.559 --> 10:46.644
Well, Alex and I have known
each other for a long time.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.804
| mean, there is quite the history
there. A lot of ups and downs.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.268
Yeah, left him at the altar
for a guy in rollerblades.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.728
Oh! That one stung!

10:52.026 --> 10:53.016
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.400
But not to worry, Suzanne.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.687
| did a lot of rebound
between the sheets-ing.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.230
(LAUGHS) Sluts.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.820
And then,
one magical night,

11:01.119 --> 11:02.905
we rekindled our fire...
Oh.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.160
...in the back of my
award-winning food truck.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.451
Well, that certainly
is a, uh, unique story.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.835
Um, I can understand
why you're...

11:13.131 --> 11:14.121
Why you're hesitant
choosing your apartment.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.255
Hesitant?
Hesitant?

11:15.550 --> 11:16.961
Hesitant?
Hesitant?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.500
Hesitant? Hesitant.
Is that even a word?

11:18.803 --> 11:20.009
Yes, it is.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.216
No! It is.
It is? Oh.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.552
We just want to make sure that
the apartment we find is perfect.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.307
Me, too. (CHUCKLES)

11:26.603 --> 11:28.389
Okay, now before we go,
are you sure

11:29.522 --> 11:30.933
this place
won't work for you?

11:31.566 --> 11:32.431
Well,

11:33.443 --> 11:35.059
it could work.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.022
Yeah, I mean, it is charming
as hell. Does it have wi-fi?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.403
Yes. Yes, of course.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.405
Ooh. No bueno.
Ooh!

11:40.700 --> 11:41.986
No. No. No. No.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.901
We're old-school.
We like dial-up.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.535
Mmm-hmm. Oh, babe,
do your impression.

Mr. Kerkovich and Mr. Rose,

12:04.349 --> 12:06.215
at our competitive
38% interest rate.

Sweet.
Not a good rate.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.643

go clothes shopping in Maxworld.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.225
(LAUGHS)
This is fun, man.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.638
And these hats are cool.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.394
Ah.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.854
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

12:21.157 --> 12:23.239
So what's next
on your saba-do list?

12:23.534 --> 12:26.242
Uh, right about now, I'd meet up with
my trainer, Gunther and go for a run.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.527
Nobody motivates me
like that guy.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.740
Nobody, huh?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.781
Nobody.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.371
Well, I think
that's Child's Play 2.

When nature calls.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.584
Excuse me, big country.

how to get to the YM.C.A.?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.375
Yeah, you go right down
that street... Shut up!

12:42.679 --> 12:43.259
Shut up!

12:44.889 --> 12:46.004
He told me to do it!

12:46.307 --> 12:46.887
| ain't running
from no one.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.632
Ahhh!

Ahhh!

12:50.937 --> 12:51.642
Ahhh!

12:53.898 --> 12:56.060
Okay, I think

12:56.359 --> 12:59.192
| have all the options
that you want here.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.524
Should be all good. Let me
just run it by the Car Czar.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.234
He knows what cars are.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.149
(GIGGLES) Yeah,
you do that, chooch.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.239
You go run it
by the Car Czar. Oh.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.994
(WHISPERS)
There is no Car Czar.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.032
No Car Czar? Then
who knows what cars are?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.371
Oh, my gullible, chesty
friend, you better buckle up,

13:15.670 --> 13:17.707
'cause this is when they
make us wait for hours

13:18.006 --> 13:19.713
and assume you will take any
price when they finally come back,

13:20.008 --> 13:21.498
but we're not
gonna do that.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.132
We're not?
No.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.839
We're gonna be ready
for all their little tricks.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.628
Watch. They're gonna turn
the air conditioning off

13:26.931 --> 13:28.763
in three, two... (WHISPERS)

just a coincidence.

Sure.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.848
Now someone's gonna come in and
offer us a pathetic amount of water.

Sorry. This is
all we have.

my price, I'm still gonna buy.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.829
Why do you have a pen in your
hand? What's happening right now?

14:43.132 --> 14:43.963
What, are you signing
something?

| don't think you
should sign something.

| don't think that's a
great idea. Great news!

agree to the price we want.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.212
Booyah!

14:50.515 --> 14:52.256
Okay. No booyah.
Because you know what?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.094
It took too long,
and now we want better.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.180
So we reject
this deal, Guy.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.594
No, we don't.
Yeah, we do.

this deal, and I'm taking it.

That's it. Okay?
Do you hear me?

15:04.112 --> 15:05.568
Yeah, I hear you.
You're just wrong.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.694
Guy, you can
do better.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.525
Jane, stop it.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.236
Taking this deal does
not mean that I'm settling

15:10.535 --> 15:11.570
or that I don't
respect myself

15:11.869 --> 15:13.155
or that I can't be the heroine

15:13.454 --> 15:16.037

15:57.039 --> 15:58.495
and already
you're homeless?

of yourself, man.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.548
But?
What a shame.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.638
(CLICKS TONGUE)

16:15.933 --> 16:16.718
(SIGHS)

16:18.102 --> 16:19.388
F. Murray Abraham!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.724
Listen, I'm sorry,
Penny. (SIGHS)

16:22.023 --> 16:23.639
| shouldn't have taken
this whole thing over.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.272
Then why did you?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.730
Because I'm Jane.
| could not help myself.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.690
| get carried away because
| want what's best for you,

16:29.989 --> 16:30.854
and I guess I thought
that maybe you couldn't...

16:32.450 --> 16:33.235
What?
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:33.534 --> 16:34.239
Do it myself?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.113
Uh...

16:38.539 --> 16:41.327
| just spoke to the
Car Czar. He's pissed.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.367
We're gonna give you
the car, plus a big rebate.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.876
Just, just don't cry
anymore and leave now.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.412
Deal.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.171
Thank you. I'm getting
blackout drunk tonight.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.548
Okay. Have fun.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.962
Oh, my Keyser Soze.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.175
You planned
that whole thing.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.263
You did the tearful
walkout on him and me.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.346
| am proud of you,
Teegan Aerosmith.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.684
It's Arrowspear.
It's not great.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.394
No. (HUFFS)

17:07.693 --> 17:10.185
| never would've
pulled this off

17:10.488 --> 17:12.148
if you hadn't
pushed me. Thank you.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.904
You're welcome.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.441
Now let's go
buy this car.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.076
Yes. Let me just grab
my license and registration.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.532
Ahhh! Jane?

17:20.830 --> 17:22.037
(FLY BUZZING)

17:22.916 --> 17:23.656
Jane?

17:26.002 --> 17:26.788
Jane?

17:27.838 --> 17:29.294
It was just so humiliating

17:29.590 --> 17:30.751
having Paul see me
like that, you know?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.290
Oh, I know.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.459
Cindy Brunswick caught me
picking boogs in class.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.299
Ugh. Been there.
Did you eat it?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.464
Oh! Martin, you got
to pick it and flick it, man!

17:40.977 --> 17:42.183
Yo. What's up?
You guys talking boogs?

17:42.478 --> 17:43.138
Yeah.
Did you eat it?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.930
Oh, come on, man. You
got to pick it and flick it, bro.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.098
Ugh.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.517
Hey, Brad, I, uh,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.436
| think I threw you into
Maxworld a little too quickly,

17:52.738 --> 17:53.773
and I wanted
to say I'm sorry

17:54.073 --> 17:55.563
that you were
embarrassed in front of Paul.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.322
Yeah.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.029
You know what?

17:59.328 --> 18:01.035
He's going into
the office on a Saturday.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.570
The guy has kids
and never even sees them.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.204
Yeah. Paul is living
the dream.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.203
Um...

18:06.502 --> 18:07.992
Oh... Oh, you...

18:08.296 --> 18:09.878
You mean that not seeing
your kids is a bad thing?

18:10.172 --> 18:12.413
Yeah.
Yeah. Proceed.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.674
| just need to find
something that's in between

18:14.969 --> 18:17.677
working 80 hours a week and crashing
some lame kid's boring birthday party.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.053
Hey. I'm right here.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.009
Oh. Martin, | didn't
mean you. | was...

18:21.309 --> 18:22.845
Whatever, Brad.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.885
| had to sit here and listen
to your lame wrap-up.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.186
Get a job.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.347
Okay.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.642
This is the only apartment in
Chicago that you haven't seen yet.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.027
It doesn't have a secret
turny-aroundy bookcase,

18:35.323 --> 18:37.189
but it's zoned for one,
and I got a guy.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.027
It is perfect.
Mmm-hmm.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.284
Al, what do you think?

18:41.579 --> 18:45.038
It's great!
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

18:45.333 --> 18:45.993
Okay.
Although...

18:46.292 --> 18:47.032
No! No!

18:48.628 --> 18:49.789
No more "Althoughs!”
| just...

18:50.087 --> 18:52.419
No! You shut
your face!

18:52.715 --> 18:53.796
| think he's trying to
say... No. Not you, either.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.627
You know what?
This is not my fault.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.008
This is your fault.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.012
You two should be hesitant
about living together.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.594
"Hesitant?" You know, your
love story that I said was unique?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.224
Yeah, it isn't cute.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.476
It sucks!

19:07.772 --> 19:11.185
You two have been making
stupid excuses all day

19:11.484 --> 19:14.522
because you know
in your stupid hearts

19:14.820 --> 19:16.026
you should not
be living together.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.029
But it's up to you.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.985
What the (BLEEP)
are you gonna do?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.746
ALL: Cheers!

19:28.042 --> 19:29.123
(PENNY LAUGHS)

19:29.418 --> 19:30.829
To your new place.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.790
(EFFEMINATE TONE) It
is stunning, simply stunning.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.455
Man, you honkeys
gonna like it here.

19:35.758 --> 19:36.964
(IMITATES BRAD) Let's
check out the bathrooms,

19:37.259 --> 19:39.842
see where these whiteys
do they business.

19:40.137 --> 19:40.968
You people are getting
way too comfortable.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.799
You know what?
| felt that. I'm sorry.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.090
That was inappropriate. It
really was wrong. BRAD: Yeah.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.849
Well, we did it.
Yes, we did.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.761
We got a place together.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.099
To the best decision
we ever made.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.310
Ah!

19:57.613 --> 19:58.774
Ooh. (CLICKS TONGUE)

20:01.075 --> 20:01.860
I'm gonna just,
uh, check out...

20:02.159 --> 20:02.944
Yeah. Yeah.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.908
Jane Kerkovich?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.372
It is I,
the Car Czar.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.586
| know what cars are.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.293
Oh, my God.
You do exist. (GASPS)

20:18.592 --> 20:20.959
In my 15 years of selling cars
and my 10 years of owning a zoo,

20:21.262 --> 20:23.219
| have never seen
a better negotiator.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.504
| want you
to come work for me.

20:24.807 --> 20:29.142
(LAUGHS) Mr. Car Czar,
| am flattered,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.895
but I already have
a job that I love.

20:32.189 --> 20:32.644
That's what
I'm willing to pay you.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.309
(SCOFFS)

20:39.905 --> 20:42.237
Here's my counter.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.898
No one should ever
leave the house

20:44.201 --> 20:45.487
without their ideal salary written
on a folded-up piece of paper.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.530
That's my counter.

20:50.833 --> 20:51.322
Here's mine.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.831
Sweetheart,
you got yourself a deal.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.716
Mmm. Now that
I'm on the team,

21:02.011 --> 21:03.217
you gonna tell me
what cars are?

21:03.512 --> 21:04.468
(SIGHS)

21:04.764 --> 21:05.469
Ah.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.381
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

21:15.274 --> 21:16.059
(GASPS)

21:17.109 --> 21:17.940
(LAUGHS)

21:19.820 --> 21:20.605
That's pretty much
what I thought.

21:20.905 --> 21:21.940
It's all they are.
Wow!

21:22.239 --> 21:22.979
I'll see you on Monday.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.238
Okay. (LAUGHS)
