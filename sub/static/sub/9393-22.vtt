00:36.832 --> 00:38.066
Hey, Brian,
have you seen the remote?

00:38.100 --> 00:39.601
I want to watch
The Weather Channel.

00:39.635 --> 00:41.135
There are tornados
in the Midwest,

00:41.170 --> 00:42.904
and I like watching
poor people scramble

00:42.938 --> 00:44.339
to save
what little they have.

00:44.373 --> 00:45.974
Uh, I don't know
where the remote is.

00:46.008 --> 00:47.308
All right,
I'll find it myself.

00:49.311 --> 00:51.846
Oh, my God, my old harmonica!

00:51.881 --> 00:54.148
I'm gonna play this
really loud tonight

00:54.183 --> 00:56.584
to get back
at our Armenian neighbors.

00:56.619 --> 00:58.186
(kids laughing inside, knocks)

00:58.220 --> 00:59.387
Hey.

00:59.421 --> 01:00.788
Hey, looks like
a fun party.

01:00.823 --> 01:03.091
Um, hey, listen, it's
2:00 in the morning.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.760
Uh, when is your five-year-old
gonna go to sleep?

01:05.794 --> 01:06.895
Soon, very soon.

01:06.929 --> 01:09.464
You want weird food
wrapped in weird leaves?

01:09.498 --> 01:11.132
Yeah, look, I'm guessing
there's some kind of

01:11.166 --> 01:13.401
soccer match from your
home country going on,

01:13.435 --> 01:15.136
and I get that, I do.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.472
But, uh, some of us
are trying to sleep,

01:17.506 --> 01:19.540
and I could almost
deal with the noise,

01:19.575 --> 01:21.876
but it's the
cologne, all right?

01:21.911 --> 01:24.879
I can smell it in my bed, and
I live two houses from here.

01:24.914 --> 01:27.548
That's how powerful
it is, okay?

01:27.583 --> 01:28.850
That's how powerful it is.

01:28.884 --> 01:30.618
You like it?

01:30.653 --> 01:32.120
Yeah, I kind
of like it.

01:36.692 --> 01:38.259
Okay, so I know
you're a harmonica,

01:38.294 --> 01:40.295
but right now
you're a 40-year-old woman

01:40.329 --> 01:42.163
with a good body
in a hotel pool.

01:42.197 --> 01:43.865
(high-pitched voice):
Hey, everybody, look at me.

01:43.899 --> 01:46.534
I work out seven days a
for these five minutes.

01:46.568 --> 01:48.169
Your attention
is going to keep me

01:48.203 --> 01:49.771
from swallowing
a bottle of pills.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.940
LOIS (in distance):
Hey, everyone, I made brownies!

01:51.974 --> 01:53.207
(gasps)
I better hurry up.

01:53.242 --> 01:54.509
I'm gonna miss the show.

01:54.543 --> 01:56.511
(crying):
What did I do?

01:56.545 --> 01:58.546
What did I do?

02:01.483 --> 02:03.685
I love brownie day.

02:06.722 --> 02:08.389
Hey, so, uh,

02:08.424 --> 02:10.625
I'm digging a hole
under the fence in the backyard.

02:10.658 --> 02:11.960
Brian, you have a car.

02:11.994 --> 02:13.261
You don't have to escape.

02:13.295 --> 02:14.896
Just don't (bleep)
say anything, okay?

02:14.930 --> 02:17.398
Oh, you know what, hang on, I
left my harmonica in the tub.

02:17.433 --> 02:19.067
I think Peter's in there
taking a bath.

02:19.101 --> 02:20.802
PETER:
Aah! Son of a bitch!

02:20.836 --> 02:22.737
What the hell did
I just sit on?

02:22.771 --> 02:24.906
Where is it?
Where's my harmonica?

02:24.940 --> 02:25.974
It's not here!

02:26.008 --> 02:27.241
Peter, have you seen
Stewie's harmonica?

02:27.276 --> 02:28.376
It was in the tub.

02:28.410 --> 02:30.511
Oh, my God, it
was in the tub,

02:30.546 --> 02:32.213
and now it's
in my butt!

02:32.247 --> 02:34.082
No!

02:34.116 --> 02:36.584
Stewie, Daddy needs
your tiny hands

02:36.618 --> 02:39.387
for a very
special project.

02:43.592 --> 02:46.060
Well, good heavens, that's
something, isn't it?

02:46.095 --> 02:48.162
By the way, Mr. Griffin,
regarding your X-rays,

02:48.197 --> 02:49.764
we're making a
coffee table book.

02:49.798 --> 02:51.232
Can you sign this
release, please?

02:51.266 --> 02:54.202
Okay, but first can we address
my husband's situation?

02:54.236 --> 02:56.070
Well, the harmonica's
up there pretty good.

02:56.105 --> 02:58.139
Unfortunately, removing
it would require

02:58.173 --> 02:59.640
a very expensive surgery

02:59.675 --> 03:02.143
that's not covered by your
T.G.I. Friday's gift card.

03:02.177 --> 03:04.045
(harmonica plays, giggles)

03:04.079 --> 03:05.546
What was that?
I don't know,

03:05.581 --> 03:08.483
(sniffs) but suddenly it smells
like John Popper in here.

03:08.517 --> 03:10.518
That was me.
I got musical farts.

03:10.552 --> 03:12.086
(plays a scale)

03:12.121 --> 03:14.622
(giggles)
Holy crap, this is awesome.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.324
I will not allow
this opportunity

03:16.358 --> 03:17.625
to go to waste.

03:21.463 --> 03:23.197
Hey, Lois, how
was your day?

03:23.232 --> 03:25.400
Terrible. I accidentally
backed over a kid

03:25.434 --> 03:27.402
in the grocery store
parking lot.

03:27.436 --> 03:29.070
(plays blues riff)

03:29.104 --> 03:30.671
Peter, I'm serious.

03:30.706 --> 03:32.974
I ran right over
the soft part of the face.

03:33.008 --> 03:34.542
I had to run away.

03:34.576 --> 03:36.944
I ditched the car
and jumped on a passing train.

03:36.979 --> 03:38.980
(plays Western music)

03:40.983 --> 03:42.350
I was so scared.

03:42.384 --> 03:44.452
I didn't get off
until I was in the South.

03:44.486 --> 03:47.321
(plays "Dixieland")

03:47.356 --> 03:48.756
What'd you do today?

03:48.791 --> 03:50.224
I pushed a boy
behind your car

03:50.259 --> 03:52.393
so I could do all
this harmonica stuff.

03:54.763 --> 03:55.730
(snoring)

03:55.764 --> 03:56.964
(whispering):
All right, Chris,

03:56.999 --> 03:59.400
Meg loves to listen
to music when she sleeps.

03:59.435 --> 04:01.436
Let's see how she likes this.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.907
Uh, Dad, I don't think
that's how it works.

04:12.181 --> 04:14.749
This had nothing to do
with the harmonica.

04:18.786 --> 04:22.089
Everybody, brace yourselves,
'cause I have got big news.

04:22.124 --> 04:23.958
I have been selected
to be a contestant

04:23.992 --> 04:25.426
on <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

04:25.461 --> 04:28.129
And they're gonna fly us all
to America for the show!

04:28.163 --> 04:30.031
What?! Oh, my God!

04:30.065 --> 04:31.866
(Italian accent):
Finally, we make'a da dreams

04:31.900 --> 04:33.534
come true in America!

04:33.569 --> 04:35.369
I am gonna make
this family proud,

04:35.404 --> 04:36.671
and not just you guys,

04:36.705 --> 04:39.140
but that old painting
of my ancestor in the attic.

04:39.174 --> 04:41.109
I did it! I'm
gonna be on TV!

04:41.143 --> 04:42.543
Did you kill the others?

04:42.578 --> 04:44.212
I shan't!
You must.

04:44.246 --> 04:46.981
(sighs) I'm gonna go talk to
the statue in the basement.

04:47.015 --> 04:48.549
Did you kill
the painting?

04:48.584 --> 04:50.651
This place is a nuthouse.

04:53.589 --> 04:56.290
(cheering)

04:56.325 --> 04:58.459
Yo, welcome back
to <i>America's Got Talent!</i>

04:58.494 --> 04:59.927
Let's welcome
our next performer,

04:59.962 --> 05:02.563
here to play the harmonica,
Peter Griffin.

05:02.598 --> 05:04.465
(applause)

05:04.500 --> 05:05.633
Hi.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.802
So, where are you from, Peter?

05:07.836 --> 05:10.304
Um, I'm from
Quahog, Rhode Island.

05:10.339 --> 05:11.472
(Lois whooping)

05:11.507 --> 05:12.840
Quahog!

05:12.875 --> 05:14.175
(chuckles):
That's my family.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.644
My wife daytime drinks
on vacation.

05:16.678 --> 05:19.213
Okay, Peter,
let's hear what you've got.

05:19.248 --> 05:21.616
("Sanford and Son Theme"
playing)

05:23.619 --> 05:25.620
(snapping to music)

05:27.000 --> 05:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:34.897 --> 05:36.230
(harmonica playing)

05:37.432 --> 05:39.433
(harmonica continues)

05:43.939 --> 05:45.006
Wow, he's nailing it.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.174
I know, shut up.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.184
(cheering)

05:56.218 --> 05:58.219
(farts, music stops)

05:59.221 --> 06:00.688
(gasping)

06:00.722 --> 06:02.623
Well, there goes
my music career.

06:02.658 --> 06:04.792
I wonder if I can get
my old job back

06:04.826 --> 06:07.061
painting kids' faces
at birthday parties.

06:07.095 --> 06:08.763
There you go, Timmy.

06:08.797 --> 06:10.264
Sir, you're gonna have
to leave.

06:10.299 --> 06:12.033
You're just drawing penises
with a Sharpie

06:12.067 --> 06:13.234
on children's faces.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.236
I don't know how
to draw a cat.

06:19.808 --> 06:21.542
Hi, I'm Amanda.

06:21.577 --> 06:23.544
I'm Chris.
You look nice,

06:23.579 --> 06:25.513
so I'll blow my burps
the other way.

06:25.547 --> 06:26.681
(laughs)

06:26.715 --> 06:28.082
You're funny.

06:28.116 --> 06:29.250
Oh, thanks.

06:29.284 --> 06:31.085
Usually people
just find me awkward.

06:31.119 --> 06:33.154
I have a hard time
with small talk.

06:33.188 --> 06:35.456
Did you find everything
you were looking for?

06:35.490 --> 06:36.857
Eh, I did all right

06:36.892 --> 06:39.012
for a guy who just had his
first homosexual experience

06:39.027 --> 06:40.861
with his guitar teacher.

06:44.233 --> 06:46.267
All right, guys,
keep an eye out for our stuff.

06:46.301 --> 06:48.569
I got tired of not being able
to find my bags,

06:48.604 --> 06:50.438
so I tied a vaguely
Hanna-Barbera-looking

06:50.472 --> 06:51.906
character to it.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.709
This trip was imposserous!

06:54.743 --> 06:56.143
There we go.

06:56.178 --> 06:58.913
I really enjoyed sitting next
to you on the plane, Chris.

06:58.947 --> 06:59.981
Me, too.

07:00.015 --> 07:01.315
I'm sorry I screamed

07:01.350 --> 07:03.584
when that guy from India
got up to stretch.

07:03.619 --> 07:05.519
Look, I'm having brunch
tomorrow with my grandparents

07:05.554 --> 07:07.021
at the Barrington
Country Club.

07:07.055 --> 07:08.256
Maybe your family
could join us.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.291
Okay, that sounds like fun.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.530
Oh, my God.

07:16.565 --> 07:17.865
Chris is dating
a Barrington.

07:17.899 --> 07:19.467
Who are the
Barringtons?

07:19.501 --> 07:21.502
They're the richest family
in all of Rhode Island.

07:21.536 --> 07:23.604
(gasps)
I must notify Gossip Girl!

07:23.639 --> 07:26.974
"Pass this along
to Gossip Girl."

07:27.009 --> 07:28.209
(phone vibrates)

07:28.243 --> 07:30.111
(gasps)

07:30.145 --> 07:31.145
(phone vibrates)

07:31.179 --> 07:33.714
(gasps)

07:33.749 --> 07:34.849
(phone vibrates)

07:34.883 --> 07:36.851
(gasps)

07:36.885 --> 07:37.852
(phone vibrates)

07:37.886 --> 07:39.387
(gasps)

07:39.421 --> 07:41.522
(phone vibrates)

07:41.556 --> 07:43.958
It's me. I'm Gossip Girl.

07:50.562 --> 07:53.848
I still can't believe Chris
is dating a Barrington.

07:53.882 --> 07:55.399
They own this whole club.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.318
Yeah, look at
all this luxury.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.053
It's like being in
a gay guy's dream.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.290
Enjoying the view?

08:03.325 --> 08:04.708
It's glorious, Edwin.

08:04.743 --> 08:06.026
Would you like
another salad bowl

08:06.060 --> 08:07.378
of chocolate-covered oysters?

08:07.412 --> 08:08.479
Is that gay enough?

08:08.513 --> 08:09.697
And then some.

08:09.731 --> 08:11.966
This has been the gayest
vacation I've ever had.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.869
I love smelling me
on your breath.

08:14.903 --> 08:16.287
Peter, what are
you doing here?

08:16.321 --> 08:17.404
You're not a member!

08:17.422 --> 08:18.989
And that means me
and the other jocks

08:19.024 --> 08:20.441
get to throw you
in the pool.

08:20.475 --> 08:21.876
Hey, Banks, Duffy,
get over here!

08:21.910 --> 08:23.511
This guy's going
for a swim.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.879
Grab him!

08:24.913 --> 08:26.547
(groaning)

08:26.581 --> 08:27.865
All right,
you're kind of heavy,

08:27.899 --> 08:29.650
so-so-so
we're gonna pee on you.

08:29.684 --> 08:31.685
(zippers zip)

08:33.255 --> 08:34.554
Not happening.

08:34.589 --> 08:36.490
All right, all right,
we'll just spit on you.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.525
(lips smacking)

08:41.413 --> 08:43.481
Oh, nothing we have works.

08:43.515 --> 08:46.116
Daddy, we're here to have
brunch with the Barringtons.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.352
The Barringtons?!
How is that possible?

08:48.386 --> 08:50.421
That family is the pinnacle
of high society.

08:50.455 --> 08:52.156
They-they haven't worked
in eight generations.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.657
All the kids have drug problems.

08:53.692 --> 08:55.159
Most of them have O.D.'d.

08:55.193 --> 08:56.527
That's terrible.

08:56.561 --> 08:58.028
Well, not all kids
make it, Lois.

08:58.063 --> 08:59.980
Just ask the
Sugar Smacks frog.

09:00.015 --> 09:02.733
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
you've lost two more.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.468
What should we do
about the graves?

09:04.503 --> 09:05.736
Dig 'em.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.176
You look really
handsome today, Chris.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.511
Thanks, Amanda.

09:13.545 --> 09:14.778
STEWIE:
Hey, Chris, say it.

09:14.813 --> 09:17.214
I use Stewart Griffin
Facial Cleanser.

09:17.249 --> 09:18.249
Try some.

09:18.283 --> 09:19.383
Give her
the Web site.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.418
StewieGriffinFacial.com.

09:21.453 --> 09:22.920
No, no, no,
th-th-that's something else.

09:22.954 --> 09:25.956
It's
StewieGriffinFacialCleanser.com.

09:25.991 --> 09:27.324
Hey, listen,
Mr. Barrington,

09:27.359 --> 09:29.426
y-your granddaughter
ain't no tease, right?

09:29.461 --> 09:31.101
'Cause Chris really
wants to get in there.

09:31.129 --> 09:33.264
Oh, you're a funny guy,
Griffin.

09:33.298 --> 09:34.532
I like that.

09:34.566 --> 09:36.634
Oh, well, you should hear
my prank phone calls.

09:36.668 --> 09:38.402
(dialing)

09:38.436 --> 09:40.571
Hey,
is your refrigerator running?

09:40.605 --> 09:41.739
MAN:
Yes, it is.

09:41.773 --> 09:43.340
Are your doors unlocked?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.975
What? Why?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.981
I don't know, they all
kind of look the same.

09:51.016 --> 09:54.451
What do you mean "they
all look the same"?

09:55.587 --> 09:58.222
Hey, there's all
my favorite people!

09:58.256 --> 10:00.157
Oh, no, not this suck-up.

10:00.191 --> 10:01.525
What are we talking about?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.993
Black people? Mexicans?

10:03.028 --> 10:04.929
Jews? (laughs)

10:04.963 --> 10:06.664
So good to see you,
Barrington.

10:06.698 --> 10:08.232
Hey, hey, where we going today,
Reginald?

10:08.266 --> 10:09.500
Huh? Huh?
Where we going today?

10:09.534 --> 10:10.901
You and me is pals,
ain't we, Reginald?

10:10.936 --> 10:12.336
Pewterschmidt,
settle down!

10:12.370 --> 10:14.805
I was having a nice
conversation with Peter.

10:14.839 --> 10:17.074
Uh, Peter, why don't you tell me
more about your job.

10:17.108 --> 10:18.709
You said you like
to drink at work?

10:18.743 --> 10:19.843
I do.
Oh, me, too!

10:19.878 --> 10:21.011
Me, too.
I'll drink anything.

10:21.046 --> 10:22.686
Even that hollandaise sauce.
Give me that.

10:24.649 --> 10:26.050
(screams)

10:26.084 --> 10:28.285
Hey, Brian,
Meg's Benedict.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.689
(forced laughter)

10:31.723 --> 10:33.023
Oh, God.
Ho, ho, ho.

10:33.058 --> 10:34.191
Stop. Stop.

10:34.225 --> 10:35.826
Stop.
I'm sorry I even said it.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.294
I'm so...
It was a mistake.

10:37.329 --> 10:39.229
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry I said it.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.932
Peter, why don't you
and I grab some air, huh?

10:41.967 --> 10:44.301
Daddy, you're making a
fool out of yourself.

10:44.336 --> 10:45.803
Why are you
acting like this?

10:45.837 --> 10:47.137
Look, I've been
trying to get

10:47.172 --> 10:49.306
into Reginald Barrington's
inner circle for years.

10:49.341 --> 10:51.008
They've been
the most elite family

10:51.042 --> 10:52.743
in this country
ever since it was founded.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.412
They were the ones who invented
the buckle on the hat.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.847
Hey, I like
your zipper hat.

10:56.881 --> 10:58.382
I like your zipper hat.

10:58.416 --> 10:59.883
Morning, fellas.

10:59.918 --> 11:03.387
Oh, that's gonna
be a game changer.

11:03.421 --> 11:05.289
Do you hunt, Peter?

11:05.323 --> 11:07.925
Well, I went to three
stores to find this shirt.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.027
(laughs)
Peter, you-you've got moxie.

11:10.061 --> 11:11.195
I like that.

11:11.229 --> 11:12.896
Hey, I've got moxie, too!
Watch this!

11:12.931 --> 11:15.232
♪ Carmen Miranda,
Carmen Miranda ♪

11:15.266 --> 11:16.634
♪ Was she a singer?

11:16.668 --> 11:17.901
♪ Was she a dancer?

11:17.936 --> 11:19.169

11:19.204 --> 11:20.838
♪ They just remember
the fruit. ♪

11:20.872 --> 11:23.140
Pewterschmidt,
you imbecile!

11:23.174 --> 11:25.209
You think that's funny,
wasting fruit?

11:25.243 --> 11:27.378
There are people dying
in hilarious places.

11:27.412 --> 11:28.479
That is it!

11:28.513 --> 11:30.914
You are officially
kicked out of this club!

11:30.949 --> 11:32.049
What?

11:32.083 --> 11:33.584
Griffin,
we just had an opening.

11:33.618 --> 11:36.053
Congratulations,
you are now a member.

11:36.087 --> 11:37.488
Oh, my God, really?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.590
And to think,
yesterday I was just a guy

11:39.624 --> 11:41.325
at home eating catnip.

11:51.102 --> 11:52.569
Excuse me, Mr. Pewterschmidt,

11:52.604 --> 11:54.571
but you're no longer
a member at this club.

11:54.606 --> 11:55.939
Don't worry,
he's my guest.

11:55.974 --> 11:57.341
Now, look, Peter,

11:57.375 --> 11:59.543
j-just because you're
a member now and I'm your guest,

11:59.577 --> 12:01.845
that doesn't mean things are
gonna change between us, right?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.247
No, no, of course not.

12:03.281 --> 12:05.416
Excuse me a
moment, Carter.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.185
Hey, guys, I just bumped into
Carter Pewterschmidt outside.

12:08.219 --> 12:09.453
What a loser, huh?

12:09.487 --> 12:10.788
(laughter)

12:10.822 --> 12:12.089
Okay, when he
wasn't looking,

12:12.123 --> 12:14.324
I stuck a springy
snake in his wallet.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.026
What? Aah!

12:16.061 --> 12:17.695
And I switched out
one of his eyeballs

12:17.729 --> 12:19.196
for a gag
exploding eyeball.

12:19.230 --> 12:20.364
What? That's impossib...

12:20.398 --> 12:21.432
Aah!

12:21.466 --> 12:23.067
And then I paid a
couple of Mexicans

12:23.101 --> 12:25.102
to run over him
with their car.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.706
I hope they don't just take
the money and skip town.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.943
Okay, you ready
for some polo?

12:32.977 --> 12:34.478
All right,
this is more like it.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.479
Where's Buttercup?

12:35.513 --> 12:37.281
Oh, only members
can ride Buttercup.

12:37.315 --> 12:40.117
Guests have to ride Topsy
the Roid Rage Horse.

12:40.151 --> 12:41.485
(snorts)

12:41.519 --> 12:43.554
Now, whatever you do,
don't say his trigger word.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.689
What?
Aah! That's his trigger word!

12:45.724 --> 12:47.658
(screaming)

12:47.692 --> 12:49.426
Don't yell! His parents
were slaughtered by yellers.

12:49.461 --> 12:50.461
Just submit.

12:50.495 --> 12:52.129
I am submitting!
It's getting worse!

12:52.163 --> 12:53.530
No, I mean really submit.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.998
Okay, okay!

12:55.033 --> 12:56.700
Oh, my God,
I meant say you're sorry,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.368
not take off your pants.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.738
Carter, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!

13:00.772 --> 13:02.906
And now that I've made you aware
of the misunderstanding,

13:02.941 --> 13:04.408
you're still continuing with it.

13:04.442 --> 13:06.510
Oh, my God!
And I'm still watching.

13:06.544 --> 13:07.811
What's wrong with me?

13:07.846 --> 13:09.480
Oh, my God!

13:12.884 --> 13:16.653
ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Game of Thrones</i> on BET.

13:16.688 --> 13:19.189
I got a big-ass coat,
chair to sit in,

13:19.224 --> 13:21.391
chalice cup of wine
and a midget,

13:21.426 --> 13:22.726
but I ain't going out there

13:22.761 --> 13:24.528
with all them monsters
out there!

13:24.562 --> 13:27.131
(sobbing)

13:27.165 --> 13:29.032
Daddy, what
happened to you?

13:29.067 --> 13:31.235
I can't live
without the country club.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.302
You did this, Peter!

13:32.337 --> 13:33.437
This is all your fault!

13:33.471 --> 13:35.038
I like your hair.
Well, Daddy,

13:35.073 --> 13:37.040
you've been treating
Peter like dirt for years.

13:37.075 --> 13:39.343
It's-it's choppier;
it's more texturized.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.779
Did you go to the Asian
guy with the one name?

13:41.813 --> 13:43.647
Well, now that you
know how it feels,

13:43.681 --> 13:45.449
maybe you want to
give him an apology.

13:45.483 --> 13:46.750
You went to Taki,
didn't you?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.186
Look, Peter, I'm sorry
for the way I treated you,

13:49.220 --> 13:52.122
but is there anything you can do
to get me back in the club?

13:52.157 --> 13:53.791
Well, I suppose I could
talk to Barrington.

13:53.825 --> 13:55.159
Really? Oh, Peter,

13:55.193 --> 13:56.794
you don't know
what this means to me.

13:56.828 --> 13:59.263
Oh, you know, I was so desperate
there for a while,

13:59.297 --> 14:00.531
I even tried a Jewish club.

14:00.565 --> 14:01.932
Oh, you don't want
to get involved

14:01.966 --> 14:03.100
with them
religious groups.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.169
They believe in all
kinds of weird stuff.

14:05.203 --> 14:06.937
If I believe
in Jesus hard enough,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.639
I will not die.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.674
If I believe
in Snake Jesus hard enough,

14:10.708 --> 14:11.975
he will die.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.144
If I believe
in Tree Jesus hard enough,

14:14.179 --> 14:15.612
both of them will die.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.047
(thunder booms)

14:17.081 --> 14:19.583
Yay! Thank you, Tree Jesus!

14:19.617 --> 14:21.418
(gunfire)

14:21.452 --> 14:23.253
Hey, Mr. Barrington.

14:23.288 --> 14:24.354
Oh, hello, Peter.

14:24.389 --> 14:25.656
I'm so glad you're here.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.058
We're shooting bald guys
under five-seven today.

14:28.092 --> 14:29.560
Hey, there's the guy

14:29.594 --> 14:31.228
who denied
my health insurance claim.

14:31.262 --> 14:32.763
Sir, your nipples are fine!

14:32.797 --> 14:34.798
You don't need
to reconstruct them!

14:34.833 --> 14:38.001
I want Hershey Kiss nipples,
and I want you to pay for them!

14:38.036 --> 14:39.837
Look, Mr. B.,
if it's okay with you,

14:39.871 --> 14:42.172
I'd like to give
my membership back to Carter.

14:42.207 --> 14:44.007
I'm sorry, Peter, but
I just don't think

14:44.042 --> 14:45.909
Pewterschmidt is
country club material.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.110
Now if you'll excuse me,

14:47.145 --> 14:49.346
I'm about to shoot
Michael Stipe.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.948
(chuckles)
Is that...

14:50.982 --> 14:52.249
Is that him
in the corner?

14:52.283 --> 14:53.684
Yes, that is him
in the corner.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.352
Is that him
in the spotlight?

14:55.386 --> 14:56.787
Would you...
Oh, damn it!

14:56.821 --> 14:57.955
Now he got away!

14:57.989 --> 14:59.857
Oh, no...
I said too much?

14:59.891 --> 15:01.491
I want you
out of here!

15:01.526 --> 15:03.460
Look, Mr. Barrington,
he's my father-in-law.

15:03.494 --> 15:05.395
So if he goes, I go.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.030
Fine, I don't care.

15:07.065 --> 15:09.666
Your low-brow antics no
longer amuse me, Griffin.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.168
You're both out
of the club.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.769
Well, I guess that's it then.

15:12.804 --> 15:14.872
Oh, there is one
more thing, actually.

15:14.906 --> 15:17.040
Can you talk to that
angry little boy

15:17.075 --> 15:18.542
down by the river bank?

15:18.576 --> 15:20.978
Uh, yeah, sure.

15:24.983 --> 15:26.383
Hey, what's eating you?

15:26.417 --> 15:27.517
Grown-ups.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.186
Yeah, grown-ups suck.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.288
Why do they get to make
all the rules?

15:31.322 --> 15:33.357
I know it seems
unfair, but, hey,

15:33.391 --> 15:35.225
there ain't no rules
in a tickle fight.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.727
(laughter)
Stop!

15:36.761 --> 15:38.562
You're tickling!

15:38.596 --> 15:40.030
Timmy, there you are!

15:40.064 --> 15:41.531
Who the (bleep)
are you?!

15:41.566 --> 15:42.966
Get away from our son!

15:43.001 --> 15:44.301
But Mr. Barrington
told me to...

15:44.335 --> 15:45.669
Who's Mr. Barrington?

15:45.703 --> 15:47.504
From the club.
What club?

15:47.538 --> 15:49.172
You're in a lot
of trouble, mister.

15:49.207 --> 15:50.307
(screams)

15:56.459 --> 15:58.694
I'm sorry I got us both
kicked out, Carter.

15:58.728 --> 16:00.362
I was just trying
to help you out.

16:00.396 --> 16:03.098
Mr. Barrington told me
I couldn't see Amanda anymore.

16:03.132 --> 16:05.534
We never even got
a chance to have sex.

16:05.568 --> 16:09.054
Everyone knows rich, Waspy girls
are the best at it.

16:09.088 --> 16:10.889
I'm really gonna miss that club.

16:10.923 --> 16:12.641
You know what part
I liked the most?

16:12.675 --> 16:14.376
Walking around
the locker room naked

16:14.410 --> 16:17.446
and offering people sections
of a tiny clementine.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.714
Clementine?

16:18.748 --> 16:20.332
Oh, thank you.

16:20.366 --> 16:21.583
Clementine?

16:21.617 --> 16:22.601
None for
me, thanks.

16:22.652 --> 16:23.685
Clementine?

16:23.719 --> 16:25.487
Yes, thank you.

16:25.521 --> 16:26.855
Clementine?
Yeah, I'll have one.

16:26.889 --> 16:28.240
Ooh, softly.
Sorry.

16:28.274 --> 16:29.658
(quietly):
Yes, I'll have one.

16:29.692 --> 16:31.460
There you go.

16:31.494 --> 16:34.596
God, it's good
to be old and nude.

16:34.630 --> 16:36.565
Look, Carter,
you can't be that surprised.

16:36.599 --> 16:37.833
I mean,
it's just human nature

16:37.867 --> 16:39.451
to suck up to the people
above you,

16:39.485 --> 16:41.820
crap on those beneath you
and undercut your equals.

16:41.854 --> 16:43.588
Well, then we just
got to figure out a way

16:43.623 --> 16:44.923
to make you fancier
than Barrington,

16:44.957 --> 16:46.558
so he's got
to suck up to you.

16:46.592 --> 16:47.692
I don't know, Peter.

16:47.727 --> 16:49.144
That'd be pretty
tough to pull off.

16:49.178 --> 16:50.429
We just got to be bold.

16:50.463 --> 16:52.497
Like those
backwards-knee birds.

16:53.516 --> 16:54.516
Oh, what? What?

16:54.550 --> 16:56.051
Oh, what? What are
you looking at?

16:56.085 --> 16:57.252
Oh, you coming for me?

16:57.270 --> 16:58.720
No, no, I'll just take

16:58.754 --> 17:01.106
a big backward-knee step
in the opposite direction.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.208
Yeah, yeah, you think
I'm afraid of you?

17:03.242 --> 17:06.511
I slept on your back
last night, you (bleep).

17:11.217 --> 17:12.684
Yes, I'll have
the filet mignon,

17:12.718 --> 17:14.719
and they can start
the sunset now.

17:14.753 --> 17:16.988
(helicopter approaches)

17:17.039 --> 17:18.707
Someone important
must be arriving

17:18.741 --> 17:20.942
because they're making
a big entrance.

17:35.558 --> 17:37.142
(bugle plays)

17:37.176 --> 17:40.128
Announcing the arrival
of His and His Majesty,

17:40.163 --> 17:42.264
the exceedingly wealthy
and very important

17:42.298 --> 17:44.499
Viscount James Earl
Tennis Racquet,

17:44.534 --> 17:46.401
and Duke of
Lacrosse Team.

17:46.435 --> 17:48.603
Hello, I'm Reginald
Barrington.

17:48.638 --> 17:50.739
Where are you fine
gentlemen from?

17:50.773 --> 17:51.973
We are European,

17:52.008 --> 17:53.942
from the United
Coloreds of Benetton.

17:53.976 --> 17:55.944
But you don't sound
like you're from Europe.

17:55.978 --> 17:57.345
Is that so?

17:57.380 --> 17:59.514
Well, perhaps I should take
my thong elsewhere.

17:59.549 --> 18:01.516
Well, let's
not be hasty.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.136
Your Majesty, won't
you please join me

18:04.170 --> 18:06.922
as my personal guests
in the Barrington Room?

18:06.956 --> 18:08.423
The Barrington Room?!

18:08.457 --> 18:10.876
Peter, that's the most exclusive
room in all of New England.

18:10.910 --> 18:13.145
Yeah, I hear it's even
harder to get in there

18:13.179 --> 18:14.679
than the University
of Arizona.

18:14.714 --> 18:16.348
Well, it's beating.

18:16.382 --> 18:18.934
Welcome to the Wildcats.

18:18.968 --> 18:20.935
This is the
Barrington Room.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.404
Have a seat in
the deepest,

18:22.438 --> 18:25.774
most luxurious leather chair
in the world.

18:27.777 --> 18:30.679
(sighs):
Oh, that's nice.

18:30.713 --> 18:32.931
Sir, may I offer you
a shoe drink?

18:32.965 --> 18:35.383
Why, yes, that'd
be lovely.

18:37.136 --> 18:39.487
(sighs):
Ah, the finer things.

18:39.522 --> 18:41.456
So, what brings
you gentlemen to town?

18:41.490 --> 18:42.674
We're here on business.

18:42.708 --> 18:44.326
In fact, we just
came from a meeting

18:44.360 --> 18:46.161
with the venerable
Carter Pewterschmidt.

18:46.195 --> 18:47.462
Outstanding man.

18:47.496 --> 18:48.730
Really? Yeah, well,

18:48.764 --> 18:51.483
he used to be a member here,
but he was very annoying.

18:51.517 --> 18:53.451
Oh, my, that's-that's
surprising.

18:53.486 --> 18:55.937
I-I've heard he has quite
the blue-blood pedigree.

18:55.972 --> 18:57.806
You know, he got a
piece of Jackie Kennedy

18:57.840 --> 19:00.442
before she was defiled by
that hairy olive-eater.

19:00.476 --> 19:02.410
Yeah, and-and
he once made me

19:02.445 --> 19:04.246
a grilled cheese
sandwich after this.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.414
Well, I wasn't sure
about Pewterschmidt,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.149
but after hearing
you gentlemen talk,

19:08.184 --> 19:10.085
maybe I could give him
another chance.

19:10.119 --> 19:11.486
Really?
Oh, wow!

19:11.520 --> 19:13.355
That's great news,
Carter. You're back in!

19:13.389 --> 19:14.806
Hey, let's get a
couple of girls

19:14.840 --> 19:17.108
and have seventh-grade-in-
the-same-room-make-outs.

19:17.143 --> 19:19.144
"Carter"? Wait a minute.

19:19.178 --> 19:20.829
You're not
Duke of Lacrosse Team!

19:20.863 --> 19:23.848
And you're not Viscount
James Earl Tennis Racquet!

19:23.883 --> 19:25.133
Security!

19:25.167 --> 19:27.335
Come throw these frauds
out of my club!

19:27.370 --> 19:28.803
Damn it, Peter,
you blew it!

19:28.838 --> 19:31.089
(screams) I knew I couldn't depend
on you!

19:31.123 --> 19:33.441
You're not worthy to lick
my designer shoes,

19:33.476 --> 19:34.809
you fat, low-life slob!

19:34.844 --> 19:36.378
But, Carter, please!

19:36.412 --> 19:39.130
Here, skip this rope and do
a lively schoolgirl chant.

19:39.165 --> 19:41.333
But, Carter, I don't know
any city girl rhymes.

19:41.367 --> 19:42.817
Do it!

19:42.851 --> 19:45.186
(chanting): Lettuce, carrots,
peppers and peas.

19:45.204 --> 19:47.706
Your mother says to
got to have these.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.491
Now do it double time
with new vegetables!

19:49.525 --> 19:51.693
Cabbage, taters,
spinach and peas.

19:51.711 --> 19:52.994
You already said "peas"!

19:53.028 --> 19:55.630
I don't know any
more vegetables.

19:55.665 --> 19:57.916
Wait a second,
hang on there.

19:57.950 --> 20:00.752
The way you abused
that man just now,

20:00.786 --> 20:02.587
the way you treated
your lesser--

20:02.622 --> 20:04.856
I underestimated you,
Pewterschmidt.

20:04.890 --> 20:07.259
I thought you were just
some suck-up loser,

20:07.293 --> 20:08.660
but you have shown me

20:08.694 --> 20:10.829
that you've got the mettle
to be one of us.

20:10.863 --> 20:12.197
You are back in the club.

20:12.231 --> 20:14.165
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Barrington!

20:14.200 --> 20:17.002
Yes. Now, I believe
there is just one last piece

20:17.036 --> 20:19.471
of unfinished business
to take care of here.

20:21.907 --> 20:23.875
(groans)

20:23.909 --> 20:26.478
I'm sorry, but the Viscount
James Earl Tennis Racquet

20:26.512 --> 20:29.247
and Duke of Lacrosse Team
already arrived two hours ago.

20:29.282 --> 20:31.683
But that's impossible!

20:35.488 --> 20:36.721
Peter, I'm sorry

20:36.756 --> 20:38.923
you've got to give up
the country club life.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.258
Oh, that's okay, Lois.

20:40.293 --> 20:41.626
'Cause you know,
I got to say,

20:41.661 --> 20:43.695
I don't think those rich guys
have it all that great.

20:43.729 --> 20:45.096
Too much stress.

20:45.131 --> 20:46.364
You know,
you give me the choice,

20:46.399 --> 20:48.066
I'll choose our life
any day of the week.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.467
Me, too, Peter.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.469
Can I have $50 to
get my hair cut?

20:51.504 --> 20:53.071
Absolutely not.
That's a waste of money.

20:53.105 --> 20:54.639
I will cut it myself.

20:54.674 --> 20:56.074
(snipping)

20:56.108 --> 20:58.376
You look like garbage.
What happened?
