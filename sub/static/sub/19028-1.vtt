WEBVTT

00:07.529 --> 00:08.928
Welcome home, Perry.

00:09.198 --> 00:10.677
Here's the new programme.

00:10.866 --> 00:12.982
You occasionally lift a finger,
helping with Jack.

00:13.202 --> 00:15.841
And I'm gonna try to keep from
hating the unborn baby

00:16.079 --> 00:18.036
in my belly that's made my ass so big,

00:18.248 --> 00:21.479
I can't fit the whole thing on a toilet
when I pee 800 times a day.

00:21.752 --> 00:22.867
Okay.

00:23.587 --> 00:26.704
You love spaghetti. You had some
just last night, didn't you?

00:26.966 --> 00:30.322
- No, I didn't.
- Jordan, the boy is lying to me.

00:30.594 --> 00:32.585
Oh, Perry, nobody likes a tattletale.

00:32.805 --> 00:34.397
Nobody does, Perry.

00:37.309 --> 00:42.258
All right, champ, just in case you get
hungry later on...

00:45.985 --> 00:48.863
Yo, Elliot, what's your ringtone?

00:49.113 --> 00:51.229
<i>Jesus Take the Wheel,
by Carrie Underwood.</i>

00:51.448 --> 00:53.245
I'm carrying under-wood right now.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.839
See, that's funny because it's true.

00:57.413 --> 00:58.607
Please.

00:59.081 --> 01:02.039
But that's all you get
for the rest of the year, Todd.

01:02.293 --> 01:04.170
<i>I'm downloading *NS YNC's
Bye, Bye, Bye.</i>

01:04.378 --> 01:05.606
When that bad boy starts a-jumpin',

01:05.796 --> 01:08.151
I defy anyone
not to shake their butt to it.

01:08.716 --> 01:09.831
I'm bringing it back.

01:10.009 --> 01:12.204
Just like you brought back Pop Rocks?

01:12.469 --> 01:13.697
Teddy boy!

01:15.806 --> 01:18.843
Yeah, well, you're not as big
a trendsetter as you think you are.

01:19.101 --> 01:20.454
Right, Keith?

01:23.314 --> 01:25.145
<i>As for me, I spent my free time</i>

01:25.357 --> 01:27.393
<i>getting co-workers I just met pregnant.</i>

01:27.610 --> 01:29.089
You're pregnant?

01:29.778 --> 01:31.177
Are you sure?

01:33.741 --> 01:35.140
I'm pretty sure.

01:35.326 --> 01:37.681
Kim, I'm not really sure
how to phrase this,

01:37.911 --> 01:40.106
so I'm just gonna dive right in.

01:40.789 --> 01:42.461
Have there been other penises?

01:42.666 --> 01:43.815
It's yours, J.D.

01:44.001 --> 01:45.719
- Cool.
- Are you okay?

01:48.213 --> 01:49.248
Yeah.

01:49.632 --> 01:52.226
I don't think I've ever seen the inside
of your apartment before.

01:52.468 --> 01:54.823
Said the father of my unborn child.

01:56.138 --> 01:58.891
That was a joke. Oh, come on.

01:59.141 --> 02:01.291
No laugh from a guy who
when he orders a coffee says,

02:01.518 --> 02:02.633
"Thanks a latte"?

02:02.811 --> 02:05.803
Well, that's different, Kim.
That's hilarious. This is life-changing.

02:06.065 --> 02:07.703
We're gonna get through this.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.494
You know what else is pretty classic?
When the coffee guy asks for money,

02:10.735 --> 02:14.126
you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other
pair of mocha-chinos. "

02:14.406 --> 02:17.045
- That always gets 'em.
- Oh, damn it.

02:19.078 --> 02:20.511
I have to go to the hospital.

02:20.704 --> 02:23.696
Scone is also a funny word,
but I don't like them.

02:23.958 --> 02:25.596
I prefer croissants.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.068
You're clearly freaking out, so,
you need to promise me that

02:28.295 --> 02:30.206
you're gonna find somebody
to talk to about this while I'm gone.

02:30.422 --> 02:31.491
Please, I'll be fine.

02:31.674 --> 02:34.234
You be careful, you're walking for two.

02:35.552 --> 02:37.110
Call, Turk.

02:45.562 --> 02:46.915
You were right, Turk.

02:47.106 --> 02:50.064
- Hell, yeah.
- All right, all right!

02:50.317 --> 02:54.356
Now listen!
This is a hospital, not a discotheque.

02:54.655 --> 02:56.293
Turn that damn thing off!

02:56.490 --> 02:58.048
Come on, buddy, please pick up.

03:03.914 --> 03:05.632
This is pretty catchy.

03:13.090 --> 03:16.605
<i>No problem, I'll just go chill at my deck
with a little vino.</i>

03:20.472 --> 03:23.987
<i>Unfortunately, it was still a hangout
spot for gay seniors.</i>

03:26.437 --> 03:28.314
All right, that's enough!

03:28.897 --> 03:31.365
<i>I have seen Les Mis
over a dozen times,</i>

03:31.609 --> 03:35.761
so I have nothing against
giant queens, per se, all right?

03:36.822 --> 03:38.938
In fact, my life would be
a whole lot easier

03:39.158 --> 03:41.228
if I was married to one of you guys.

03:41.452 --> 03:42.885
Excuse me.

03:44.413 --> 03:45.892
You heard him, girls.

03:46.081 --> 03:47.400
Let's roll.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:58.696 --> 05:00.493
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

05:00.698 --> 05:02.848
Las Vegas Police Department.

05:03.617 --> 05:04.686
Hello!

05:07.288 --> 05:09.324
Why didn't you answer your phone
when I called you?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.859
I was dancing.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.589
Wait, let me hear it.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.189
There it is.

05:33.897 --> 05:35.410
Well, look, I'm in surgery all morning,

05:35.608 --> 05:38.645
but we can meet for lunch,
talk this through then, okay?

05:38.902 --> 05:41.587
Hello? J.D., this is
a really bad connection.

05:41.822 --> 05:43.335
Ted, please!

05:47.202 --> 05:48.237
Ted!

05:51.040 --> 05:53.031
Okay, I'll see you at lunch.

05:53.959 --> 05:56.427
Hey, Mojambo,
this here's our new flagpole.

05:56.670 --> 06:00.185
Why don't you show Old Glory
a little respect and snap off a salute?

06:02.885 --> 06:03.874
There's no flag up there.

06:04.178 --> 06:07.090
We're at war, my friend.
All American flags are on back-order.

06:07.348 --> 06:10.499
What do you want me to do in the
meantime, run a pirate flag up there?

06:10.768 --> 06:13.726
Maybe turn the whole building
into a pirate ship?

06:14.188 --> 06:16.304
I could put a captain's wheel up on
the roof,

06:16.523 --> 06:18.991
catch a parrot somehow,
slap on an eye-patch,

06:19.234 --> 06:22.783
go to work with a caulk gun,
seal her up, make her water-tight.

06:23.072 --> 06:24.630
I could take her out to sea.

06:24.823 --> 06:27.542
- Are you insane?
- No, I'm a pirate.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.427
Whatever. I'm not saluting a pole.

06:32.247 --> 06:34.761
And so it begins, again.

06:36.293 --> 06:37.726
My life is over.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.717
Oh, come on, you've gotta
focus on the positives.

06:39.922 --> 06:42.561
For instance, the medical miracle that
is one woman

06:42.800 --> 06:46.315
actually impregnating another woman,
SHeDAIS Y!

06:48.597 --> 06:51.589
Coincidentally,
I have a cousin named Shedaisy.

06:51.892 --> 06:52.927
What?

06:53.102 --> 06:55.138
J.D. needs us right now, okay.
So, this is what we're gonna do.

06:55.354 --> 06:58.391
Dr Cox, you're backing off.
Elliot, you go talk to him.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.002
Can't wait to talk to J.D.

07:00.192 --> 07:02.342
Maybe we can chat about
how everyone in this frickin' hospital,

07:02.569 --> 07:03.888
other than me, is having a baby.

07:04.071 --> 07:06.790
I mean, seriously. Having a baby,
having a baby, having a second baby.

07:07.032 --> 07:08.909
Oh, having her
husband's best friend's baby.

07:09.118 --> 07:11.473
That's right, Mona, everyone knows!

07:13.205 --> 07:14.479
What are you looking at,
Dr Beardface?

07:14.665 --> 07:18.101
You want a kid? 'Cause, I swear
to God, I will mount you right now!

07:18.377 --> 07:20.607
It's Beardface, damn it!

07:22.840 --> 07:25.991
Gather around, doomed new interns
who just paged me.

07:26.343 --> 07:29.972
Quick question.
What does this outfit tell you?

07:30.264 --> 07:33.620
You are entering
a Joe Piscopo look-alike contest?

07:35.311 --> 07:37.267
It means that I was just working out,

07:37.479 --> 07:39.310
which, incidentally,
is the last remaining activity

07:39.523 --> 07:42.833
I have in my adult life
that qualifies as "me time. "

07:43.110 --> 07:45.465
Other activities recently
crossed off of that list

07:45.696 --> 07:47.334
include my morning
dump and all showers.

07:47.531 --> 07:50.045
You see, my dear son Jack
has decided that those

07:50.284 --> 07:54.402
are team sports. However, I'm here
and I'm totally psyched to hear

07:54.705 --> 07:57.981
whatever the superty-duper reason
is that you paged me.

07:59.084 --> 08:01.393
Mr Wyatt's chart said to
remove his eight stitches,

08:01.629 --> 08:03.267
but we counted nine.

08:03.505 --> 08:05.655
- Should we leave one?
- That's it.

08:07.343 --> 08:09.573
Every single one of you is
gonna run laps around the hallways

08:09.803 --> 08:11.282
till I say stop.

08:12.222 --> 08:13.780
Think I'm kidding?

08:17.728 --> 08:20.959
Perry, what the hell?
I just got a call from Jack's school.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.267
Apparently, they served
spaghetti for lunch,

08:23.484 --> 08:26.203
so he had some sort of
Vietnam flashback.

08:26.862 --> 08:28.659
We're having a second baby.

08:28.864 --> 08:30.536
You need to deal
with your anger issues.

08:30.741 --> 08:33.015
I don't have any anger issues.

08:33.243 --> 08:37.953
Dr Cox, I'm sorry,
but my asthma is really starting to...

08:40.292 --> 08:41.725
Get out of here!

08:42.461 --> 08:43.688
Seriously.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.916
What are you working on, young man?

08:50.135 --> 08:53.207
New ways to torture that guy. See?

08:58.477 --> 09:00.832
Mrs Zeebee, I know that
we were hoping

09:01.063 --> 09:04.260
that the pain around your areola
was simple mastitis,

09:04.817 --> 09:07.490
but it turns out that it's breast cancer.

09:09.863 --> 09:12.172
I can't believe this is happening to me.

09:12.408 --> 09:14.000
Trust me,
I know what you're going through.

09:14.201 --> 09:16.669
Just yesterday,
I found out that my girlfriend...

09:16.912 --> 09:19.984
Excuse us. Dude, please tell me
you're not comparing getting cancer

09:20.249 --> 09:22.604
- to knocking up your girlfriend.
- I was trying to.

09:22.835 --> 09:25.429
You can't pawn your personal stuff off
on your patients.

09:25.671 --> 09:28.310
What about you
and the motorcycle accident guy?

09:28.882 --> 09:31.271
So get this. My pregnant wife
has decided that it's okay

09:31.510 --> 09:33.023
to steal my pillow
in the middle of the night

09:33.220 --> 09:35.688
and sleep with it in between her legs.

09:35.931 --> 09:37.603
When am I going into surgery?

09:37.808 --> 09:40.686
Oh, we can't start the surgery
until the troopers find your foot.

09:43.063 --> 09:45.338
That was different.
He said, "What's up?"

09:48.902 --> 09:50.460
Hardly seems like
much of a punishment

09:50.654 --> 09:51.769
for the kid from Kenya.

09:51.947 --> 09:53.585
I mean, God's sake, he can run all day.

09:53.782 --> 09:55.181
You know, maybe Jordan's right.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.676
Maybe it's time you start dealing
with your anger issues.

09:57.911 --> 10:01.506
Carla, for something to be an issue,
it needs to cause a problem.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.509
And, honestly,
aside from having to, by law,

10:04.752 --> 10:06.822
remain 30 feet away from
a certain telemarketer

10:07.046 --> 10:09.321
who I visited
while he was eating his dinner,

10:09.548 --> 10:11.778
I don't see the downside.

10:13.302 --> 10:16.021
Mr Slydell here is suffering from
peptic ulcer disease

10:16.263 --> 10:19.494
and hypertension, two conditions
you often see in very angry people.

10:19.767 --> 10:23.077
Well, now, you don't know that this
gentleman is angry.

10:23.812 --> 10:28.442
Damn it! Why won't this TV go on?

10:30.319 --> 10:32.196
That was the bed remote.

10:33.489 --> 10:35.047
Ted, I got the cola.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.470
- Did you get the Pop Rocks?
- No, the vending machine was out,

10:37.701 --> 10:41.091
so I went to the generic store
and got some Fizzy Pebbles.

10:41.372 --> 10:44.170
- You sure we should do this?
- I'm sick of legends and hearsay, Keith.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.849
I have to know!

10:49.129 --> 10:51.359
No scuffing. No scuffing!

10:52.174 --> 10:56.213
Okay, what if
I get a sex change operation

10:56.512 --> 10:58.742
and I trick him into marrying me?

10:59.223 --> 11:01.896
But if it doesn't work,
you'll just be an older,

11:02.226 --> 11:04.103
fairly ugly janitor-woman.

11:05.187 --> 11:06.415
That's true.

11:06.605 --> 11:08.118
You know,
you and I are quite a bit alike.

11:08.315 --> 11:10.112
I spent most of my life
trying to become a lawyer,

11:10.651 --> 11:12.960
but I could never get my
Juris Doctorate.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.272
How's that make us alike?

11:14.571 --> 11:17.881
I spent years
trying to get that damn J.D.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.565
I'm alive!

11:26.166 --> 11:27.724
Hey!

11:27.918 --> 11:29.988
That'll be fun to clean up.

11:30.754 --> 11:33.587
You know what's so messed up
about this whole baby thing?

11:33.841 --> 11:37.516
I mean, I feel like I'm drowning
and it hasn't even fazed Kim.

11:39.096 --> 11:41.564
Okay, let's, close her up.

11:42.766 --> 11:46.441
- Dr Briggs, why are you crying?
- This song always gets me.

11:49.273 --> 11:52.185
<i>My brother was killed
by a Funky Cold Medina.</i>

11:52.484 --> 11:56.397
I'm sorry J.D., but you knew that
this could happen when you had sex.

11:56.697 --> 11:57.891
I have to tell you guys something,

11:58.073 --> 11:59.062
but you have to
promise not to laugh, okay?

11:59.241 --> 12:00.230
- Oh, no. Absolutely.
- I'll try.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.364
Sure.

12:01.535 --> 12:04.003
Okay, on the night of said conception,

12:05.122 --> 12:10.071
Kim and I nuded up and,
the dirty talk began

12:10.419 --> 12:12.569
and I got a little over-excited.

12:13.839 --> 12:15.716
She like the dirty talk?

12:15.924 --> 12:18.563
No, I do. I find it gets the ladies going,

12:18.802 --> 12:21.191
but I occasionally
get wrapped up in it myself,

12:21.430 --> 12:24.308
especially when I do
some of my different voices and...

12:24.558 --> 12:25.513
He does.

12:25.684 --> 12:29.472
Anyhoo, there was some
unexpected friendly fire.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.733
And, even though I never

12:33.525 --> 12:36.642
got a chance to enter the village,

12:39.031 --> 12:41.499
there was an air strike

12:41.742 --> 12:44.051
on one of the outlying regions.

12:45.579 --> 12:46.614
Thank you.

12:46.789 --> 12:49.098
Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OBG

12:49.333 --> 12:52.405
and they said it's not uncommon
for a woman to get pregnant

12:52.670 --> 12:55.230
even if there was no actual penetration.

12:56.131 --> 12:59.328
What you're trying to tell us is that

12:59.593 --> 13:01.345
you never actually had sex with her?

13:01.553 --> 13:03.305
No, I didn't have a condom.

13:04.390 --> 13:07.905
And we decided
not to have sex because,

13:08.811 --> 13:10.403
here's the kicker,

13:10.604 --> 13:12.196
I didn't want to get her pregnant.

13:12.398 --> 13:14.036
Oh, no, you didn't.

13:15.818 --> 13:19.254
<i>As I thought about how Mrs Zeebee
and I had gotten such a raw deal,</i>

13:19.530 --> 13:22.283
<i>I realised how easy it was
for doctors to see themselves</i>

13:22.533 --> 13:23.761
<i>in their patients.</i>

13:23.951 --> 13:26.067
<i>Whether it's in the choices
they made in their life...</i>

13:26.287 --> 13:29.324
My anger not only cost me my health,

13:30.541 --> 13:33.772
it also cost me my job, my marriage.

13:35.129 --> 13:37.324
It cost me damn near everything.

13:37.673 --> 13:39.186
You're killing me.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.055
<i>...or the choices they didn't make.</i>

13:41.260 --> 13:43.216
I was so obsessed with getting my J.D.

13:43.429 --> 13:46.102
that I never did the things
I really wanted to do.

13:46.348 --> 13:50.261
- Start a family, see the world...
- Punch a whale.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.693
No, I punched a whale,
right in the face.

13:54.982 --> 13:56.893
Down he went, like Liston.

13:58.277 --> 14:01.370
<i>Either way, it forces you to face your
problems head-on.</i>

14:01.530 --> 14:04.761
There you are. You ready to grab
some lunch so that we can talk?

14:05.034 --> 14:06.183
<i>Or not.</i>

14:06.660 --> 14:10.778
You know what, Kim, I don't think
I can handle this right now.

14:11.832 --> 14:14.062
Oh, okay, yeah. That's great.

14:22.509 --> 14:23.703
Heads up.

14:25.137 --> 14:26.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:26.722 --> 14:28.075
Have you seen J. D?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.661
I have not.

14:30.851 --> 14:32.523
Any idea where he is?

14:36.106 --> 14:38.017
Teaching CPR
to underprivileged youth

14:38.233 --> 14:40.224
at Lincoln Middle School
on 18th Street.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.672
<i>I can't believe he got that.</i>

14:41.862 --> 14:44.854
<i>We are so ready for that charades
tournament on Saturday.</i>

14:45.115 --> 14:47.071
Come on, Turk, where is he?

14:47.826 --> 14:52.422
You know, Kim, I'm sorry,
but I really have no idea.

14:52.748 --> 14:53.976
<i>Traitor!</i>

14:56.418 --> 14:58.886
Upside-down, the lily-padded go-cart...

14:59.505 --> 15:01.382
Space-wasters, why haven't any of you

15:01.590 --> 15:04.229
placed a pulmonary artery cath
on this guy?

15:04.468 --> 15:07.904
Hey, let's try to use our inside voice
around the interns.

15:08.305 --> 15:09.420
We don't want to scare them.

15:09.598 --> 15:11.316
What new kind of crazy is this?

15:11.517 --> 15:15.271
Oh, Elliot snapped a little and
decided the interns were her babies.

15:15.562 --> 15:16.836
Oops, Jakey.

15:17.064 --> 15:20.534
Somebody's got a little smoodgie
on his face. There you go.

15:20.818 --> 15:22.456
As long as he gets done.

15:22.653 --> 15:25.326
Why doesn't Elliot have a
freshly-ripped new one, right now?

15:25.572 --> 15:27.722
I'm not freshly ripping anybody
anything any more.

15:27.950 --> 15:29.588
I am done with anger.

15:29.994 --> 15:32.508
Is that going to be like the
time you quit drinking?

15:32.746 --> 15:34.941
'Cause that was
the longest 20 minutes of my life.

15:35.165 --> 15:38.157
Your sarcasm is wasted on me,
you giant pregnant beast.

15:38.419 --> 15:41.172
This is an anger-free zone.

15:41.422 --> 15:43.378
There is no anger here.

15:46.051 --> 15:47.200
Counter.

16:00.024 --> 16:01.537
I filled it with blue Gatorade.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.202
- I just do that to freak people out.
- Scintillating.

16:04.445 --> 16:07.039
Say, since we're small-talking,
let me ask you a question.

16:07.281 --> 16:10.591
Do you have regrets
about the way you lived your life?

16:10.868 --> 16:12.267
'Cause I think I do.

16:12.453 --> 16:14.967
You've never been to Paris
and cleaned a French toilet, huh?

16:15.205 --> 16:17.161
Good one. No, that's not it.

16:17.625 --> 16:20.059
Come on, be straight with me.
Do you think I'm wasting my life?

16:20.294 --> 16:22.091
Let's cut to the chase, freak show.

16:22.296 --> 16:24.412
If you're a 44-year-old man
wearing a jumpsuit

16:24.632 --> 16:26.907
and you are not climbing
into the cockpit of a rocket ship,

16:27.134 --> 16:29.887
chances are you've made
a lot of wrong turns along the way.

16:30.137 --> 16:31.365
Good talk.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.280
Dude, what the hell am I
supposed to tell Kim

16:36.477 --> 16:37.876
when she asks
why I drove off like that?

16:38.062 --> 16:40.212
Tell her you hate white chicks,
and then when she says,

16:40.439 --> 16:42.157
<i>"No, you don't," you say,
"I mean White Chicks, the movie.</i>

16:42.358 --> 16:43.996
"Not a fan of those Wayans brothers. "

16:44.193 --> 16:46.753
Then she'll laugh
and forget why she was mad at you.

16:46.987 --> 16:49.979
You're right, that'll work. But still,
you need to man up and talk to her.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.673
You have no idea
what I'm going through.

16:51.867 --> 16:54.586
Really? Because the last time
I checked, I was having a kid, too.

16:54.828 --> 16:57.296
Yeah, that you planned, with your wife,

16:57.623 --> 16:59.614
whose middle name you know.

17:01.502 --> 17:02.901
It's Juanita, Turk!

17:03.087 --> 17:04.805
Carla's middle name is Juanita!

17:05.005 --> 17:06.483
I knew it was something Puerto Rican!

17:06.674 --> 17:07.867
What if Kim and I
don't end up together?

17:08.050 --> 17:09.722
Okay, I already have enough trouble
meeting girls.

17:09.926 --> 17:10.915
Can you imagine it now?

17:11.095 --> 17:13.211
"Hey, how you doing? I'm J.D.
and this little bugger right here

17:13.430 --> 17:15.147
"already hates you
for not being his real mommy. "

17:15.348 --> 17:17.782
"Wanna get freaky?
I'm apparently very fertile. "

17:18.018 --> 17:20.088
My life has changed forever.

17:20.604 --> 17:24.074
You wanna be like everybody else and
say, "Everything's gonna be just fine. "

17:24.358 --> 17:27.794
Dude, I'm your best friend.
I'll tell you whatever you want me to.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.333
Say, Barbie, have you seen
any of the interns around?

17:34.576 --> 17:38.569
Yeah, they did so well at rounds,
I'm just letting them watch a show.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.739
Hi, interns.

17:41.959 --> 17:42.914
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:43.585 --> 17:46.418
Look, you pretty obviously
have short-circuited

17:46.672 --> 17:48.788
because the odds of you
ever actually having a baby

17:49.008 --> 17:51.317
are roughly on a par
with me finding the Loch Ness monster

17:51.552 --> 17:53.588
in my bathtub!

17:53.804 --> 17:55.157
I can't hear the TV.

18:00.686 --> 18:02.039
Hi, honey!

18:05.274 --> 18:08.584
Go on, get out of here!
Come on. You, too! Get out of here!

18:10.154 --> 18:12.588
Don't even say a word.

18:13.782 --> 18:17.457
Mr Slydell's ulcer perforated
and he bled out. He's dead.

18:26.670 --> 18:30.709
If it isn't my beautiful bride,
Carla Juanita Espinosa.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.031
Juanita? You think
my middle name is Juanita?

18:36.472 --> 18:38.269
I am going to kill J.D.

18:42.519 --> 18:45.477
Dr Dorian, look, this is a bit awkward,

18:45.731 --> 18:47.005
but, as Chief of Medicine

18:47.191 --> 18:51.104
I feel obligated to ask you
about your relationship with Dr Briggs.

18:53.072 --> 18:56.269
Was she naughty? I bet she's a hellcat.

18:57.159 --> 18:58.877
- Get help, sir.
- Never mind.

18:59.078 --> 19:00.989
It's better up here.

19:02.665 --> 19:04.860
Mrs Zeebee's CAT scan came back.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.030
<i>Oh, man, this just sucks.</i>

19:11.048 --> 19:15.678
Mrs Zeebee, unfortunately the cancer
isn't localised just to your breast.

19:16.971 --> 19:19.326
We're gonna have to start chemo
right away.

19:19.556 --> 19:21.831
<i>The most important thing to remember
when you see yourself</i>

19:22.059 --> 19:24.653
<i>in a patient is that
they're not actually you.</i>

19:42.746 --> 19:45.021
<i>In fact, sometimes they're actually
who we wish</i>

19:45.249 --> 19:46.887
<i>we had the courage to be.</i>

19:47.084 --> 19:49.962
You know what?
I'm gonna get through this.

19:51.255 --> 19:52.688
Just you watch.

19:53.507 --> 19:55.896
It's not like I can change
what's already happened.

19:56.135 --> 19:59.332
The only thing to do is move forward
and deal with it, right?

19:59.847 --> 20:00.882
Yeah.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.642
<i>Right then, I knew exactly
what I had to do,</i>

20:03.851 --> 20:05.728
<i>come hell or high water.</i>

20:11.942 --> 20:14.012
I got your Juanita.

20:14.737 --> 20:18.491
Juanita, huh?
Well, you can Juanita this right there!

20:24.038 --> 20:26.506
- What the hell?
- It's now or never.

20:40.554 --> 20:42.590
Are you going to let me down
any time soon?

20:42.806 --> 20:45.684
Not until you spend a little time
acting like a flag.

20:45.935 --> 20:48.165
<i>As I acted like a flag,
I sensed that the janitor</i>

20:48.395 --> 20:50.829
<i>learnt nothing from this experience.</i>

20:58.197 --> 21:01.189
<i>Dr Cox, on the other hand,
got halfway there.</i>

21:01.450 --> 21:03.088
<i>He may always be angry at work,</i>

21:03.285 --> 21:05.480
<i>but he had learnt to control himself
when it counts.</i>

21:05.704 --> 21:07.535
Jacky, would you like some hot dogs?

21:07.748 --> 21:09.466
I don't want hot dogs.

21:12.294 --> 21:15.570
Oh, that's okay because we've got
your favourite yogurt.

21:17.883 --> 21:21.637
<i>As for me, I finally came through,
even if it was a little late.</i>

21:22.054 --> 21:24.488
- Can we talk?
- That would be great.
