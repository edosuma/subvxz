You know how we're so close and,
we tell each other everything?

00:22.860 --> 00:24.500
Let's not do that anymore!

00:26.300 --> 00:28.330
Yeah, I meant what's
going on at Rico's?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.930

01:03.690 --> 01:05.220
Hey, I'll try an empanada.

01:05.810 --> 01:11.100
I don't sell empanadas!
I sell empa--annnades!

01:12.190 --> 01:14.720

01:30.230 --> 01:31.790

But I won't. Cause then
I'd yak up my empanada!

01:36.260 --> 01:39.020
Fine. Three bucks people!

01:41.690 --> 01:45.110
I... I'm all out. Can you
wait until I get my allowance?

01:45.610 --> 01:49.320
Why wait when there's other forms of
payment? Which brings us back to...

01:50.250 --> 01:51.840
Lily, loan me three bucks!

01:54.790 --> 02:00.120
I love the ladies.But George Washington...
you're still the best.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.030
OK... That was way too close.

02:06.310 --> 02:08.180
I gotta' get a raise
on my allowance.

02:08.570 --> 02:12.840
What, you think...back when I was a boy',
is going to give you more money?

02:13.120 --> 02:15.620
Besides, didn't he just raise your
allowance like a couple of months ago?

02:15.630 --> 02:18.820
Yeah. And it's not his fault you blow
it all on shoes. You guys had a deal.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.960
Yeah, but no deal is a match for
the puppy dog face, watch it...

02:23.690 --> 02:25.590
Please Daddy...

02:28.780 --> 02:30.830
Please Daddy...

02:35.580 --> 02:39.830
Now don't you stop boy. That silly puppy
dog face don't work on me anymore.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.900
Besides, I just bumped up
your curfew last month.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.040
This is a huge party and I'm gonna' be the
only one who's gonna' have to leave early.

02:48.090 --> 02:50.850
Well too bad!
Back when I was a boy...

02:53.490 --> 02:56.470
If I made a deal with my Daddy,
I stuck to it.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.490
Now take a page from your sister.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.660
I just raised her allowance and
you don't see her come

03:01.660 --> 03:06.540
whining around asking for more
money with that silly puppy
dog looking face.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.180
How funny is that. You were
just about to go in there and
whine for more money

03:11.180 --> 03:13.940
with that silly puppy
dog face...and I'm gonna
shut up now.

04:12.260 --> 04:18.279
Stupid sandals! "Buy me,
buy me! I'm expensive but I'm cute!"

04:18.310 --> 04:23.180
I should put you at the back of the closet
so you can think about what you've did you
open toed little teasers!

04:23.620 --> 04:26.020
Or you could give us to Lily...

04:27.620 --> 04:29.810
That would punish us!

04:32.080 --> 04:34.900
Hey! Don't look at me, you're the
one who bought the talking shoes!

04:35.090 --> 04:38.120
I so need more guy friends!

04:39.440 --> 04:43.320
Now, I have to wait until I get my
next allowance. I can't go anywhere!

04:43.650 --> 04:48.190
I'm trapped in it's re-run season.
Curse you cruel fate!

04:48.250 --> 04:51.050
Oh come on Miley, you'll get through it.
And we'll be right here with you.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.900
- Oh, except for the night we got that movie ...
- Sssh!

04:55.170 --> 04:56.850
You're going to a movie without me?

04:56.850 --> 05:02.010
Well... you don't have the money, and if we
don't go then there'll be three of us who
are sad, now,

05:02.180 --> 05:03.750
you wouldn't want that would you?

05:04.290 --> 05:05.860
Yes I would.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.120
Come on! You're Hannah
stinkin' Montana!

05:09.330 --> 05:13.450
You just starred in a movie and
you don't have enough money
to see one! That's ridiculous!

05:13.730 --> 05:16.220
You are right! I am
Hannah stinkin' Montana

05:16.220 --> 05:18.620
and I'm going to go and get myself a
stinkin' raise! Wo!

05:20.980 --> 05:22.070
You think she's gonna get it?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.100
No stinking way!

05:24.100 --> 05:26.340
- Daddy, I need to talk to you.
- Ar, excuse me!

05:26.340 --> 05:29.100
But we are having a serious
conversation right now.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.810
Please let Jackson go to the party!
Or I'll be his only friend!

05:39.030 --> 05:42.350
And that'd be sad. And weird.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.480
No!

05:49.850 --> 05:52.390
You are the worst dad ever!

05:53.990 --> 05:55.350
Daddy, I have to talk to you.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.010
What's up, partner?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.290
Alone.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.690
Oh sorry, what's up bud?

06:01.160 --> 06:05.430
OK... I'm not going to beat around the bush,
I'm just going to come out... and say it.

06:05.570 --> 06:10.220
Lay it all the table!
Right here, right now!

06:11.340 --> 06:12.580
Is that a new shirt?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.710
Sure is!One of those
new microfibers.

06:15.770 --> 06:20.370
Totally stain resistant,
yet soft, stylish and tap...

06:20.410 --> 06:21.960
I need a raise in my allowance!

06:22.240 --> 06:23.000
What?

06:23.370 --> 06:25.320
I know you just gave me one,
but I'm sixteen now.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.990
I mean you can trust me with a car, and you
can't trust me with just a little bit of
Hannah money!

06:29.290 --> 06:34.790
I mean, I'm not talking crazy cash,
just like a ten or... twenty.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.390
How's five thousand dollars sound?

06:37.950 --> 06:40.860
Daddy's whose wallet's even
tighter than his jeans say what?

06:41.970 --> 06:46.180
Yeah, I mean you are getting older.
You do work hard for your money.

06:46.500 --> 06:51.250
You're a responsible young lady,
and dang-flab-it! I think you deserve it.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.550
I do? I mean -

06:54.620 --> 06:56.480
yeah, I do!

06:56.840 --> 07:01.240
I am totally responsible enough to
handle five thousand smackerooneys!

07:02.420 --> 07:05.500
Alright then. I say first
thing tomorrow morning

07:05.500 --> 07:08.060
we stop your allowance you take
that down to the bank and

07:08.060 --> 07:09.620
open up your very
own checking account.

07:09.980 --> 07:13.630
Oh daddy, thank you so much,
you will not regret this, I promise!

07:14.520 --> 07:16.620
I'm getting tears on your
new shirt, I'm sorry.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.190
Oh, that's OK... look,
the tears bead right off.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.130
That's the microfibre at work.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.630
I cannot wait to
tell Lily and Oliver.

07:23.970 --> 07:27.050
Ar .. something tells
me they already know.

07:45.870 --> 07:48.300
Well, well, well.

07:48.450 --> 07:51.300
Look at those microfibres work, son.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.140
I sure could've used this shirt when
you kids were potty training.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.990
I mean,you were like an
out of control fire hose!

07:58.230 --> 08:02.270
I don't want to hear any more of your
stories, Mr. "Back when I was a Boy".

08:02.570 --> 08:04.100
You won't change my curfew,

08:04.100 --> 08:08.060
but when Miley
asks for more money it's,
"anything for my favorite".

08:09.210 --> 08:11.880
That hurts. Bad.

08:12.730 --> 08:14.190
That's why I stop growing.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.330
You need love to grow!

08:20.940 --> 08:26.180
You know what son. I feel your "fake" pain,
so I'm going to fake like I bought it.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.860
I'm going to raise your curfew.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.600
You...

08:29.950 --> 08:33.010
give me your big old slice
of southern fried wonderful!

08:34.320 --> 08:37.870
Just make sure you take your cell phone
with you in case I need to get a hold of
you.

08:37.870 --> 08:39.380
Ar... sure...

08:40.419 --> 08:45.140
What possible reason would I have to say
no to that incredibaly reasonable request?

08:46.820 --> 08:49.310
Heaven, this room is a mess!

08:50.580 --> 08:52.020
You lost your phone again,
didn't you?

08:52.070 --> 08:55.970
No! I know exactly where it is...
it's... charging...

08:56.530 --> 08:59.720
in its special... you know...
charging place.

09:00.510 --> 09:01.320
Would you excuse me?

09:01.420 --> 09:02.510
You looking for something?

09:02.540 --> 09:07.420
Like what? My cell phone because
I lost it or something? You wish!

09:29.840 --> 09:34.980
You know what, if the boy didn't
know already know where his
phone was then I'd tell him.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.360
But since he knows "
egg-zactly" where it is...

09:40.860 --> 09:46.050
Oh, Robby Ray, you know
yolk-ster! He, he, he!

09:53.710 --> 09:56.710
Oh, what about these cheques with the
romantic couple walking on the beach?

09:56.730 --> 09:59.000
Excellent choice, very popular.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.840
No, I don't need to be reminded
every time I go to write a
cheque that I don't have a boyfriend.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.580
Perfectly understandable.

10:07.940 --> 10:13.490
Ar, you know what, I'd go with the eagle,
because it's strong, majestic...
independent.

10:13.790 --> 10:15.600
No, I see bird, I think poop.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.380
I'll get another book,
Miss Stewart.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.620
That would be lovely Ajay!

10:22.290 --> 10:24.810
you hear that,
he called me Miss Stewart.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.380
Ar, no, I think he
called you "Miss Stewart"

10:28.410 --> 10:32.380
Who cares? Like my dad, he realizes that I
am a mature,

10:32.380 --> 10:37.100
responsible adult, totally
capable of handling finiancial matters.

10:37.650 --> 10:41.900
Oh, kitty playing with yarn!
oh,Cute!

10:41.910 --> 10:43.110
Oh cute!

10:43.230 --> 10:44.730
Ignore him. I'll take the kitties.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.420
Let me just order those for you.

10:48.260 --> 10:49.660
That was weird, he didn't smile.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.420
Oops almost forgot...

10:53.760 --> 10:58.380
I cannot believe I am about to have my very
own checking account with five thousand
smackerooneys in it!

10:59.990 --> 11:02.990
- Just in time for our ...
- "Monthly Mall Crawl".

11:03.280 --> 11:05.340
I think it's so cool your
dad trusts you like that.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.580
My Dad still holds my
hand in parking lots...

11:07.580 --> 11:09.580
and we're forgetting I said that
right now!

11:14.560 --> 11:16.130
What do you want, Jackson?

11:18.850 --> 11:20.160
Have you seen my phone?

11:21.050 --> 11:24.960
oh yeah,It's right next to the big
box of "I Couldn't care less".

11:26.010 --> 11:28.350
This is serious,
I can't find it anywhere!

11:31.690 --> 11:33.010
Well have you checked
the living room?

11:34.000 --> 11:38.150
Nooo! The thought
never occured to me!

11:39.790 --> 11:40.390
What's going on?

11:41.510 --> 11:47.410
Dad's given Jackson a chance
for a little more responsibilty,
and once again, he's blown it!

11:47.470 --> 11:48.750
See, that's the
difference between us.

11:48.830 --> 11:52.900
Dad always has to test Jackson, but with
me, he just trusts me...

11:52.900 --> 11:55.340
and I cannot
believe I didn't see this coming!

11:57.040 --> 11:57.720
Wow!

11:58.150 --> 12:00.140
Yeah, it's so obvious!

12:01.720 --> 12:02.840
You guys have no idea, do you?

12:02.880 --> 12:03.910
- No.
- Not a clue.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.460
That sneaky hill-billy's testing me to see
if I'll blow it and

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
waste five thousand
dollars on stupid things.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.420
By the way, the kitty cheques
are an extra five dollars a box.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.490
Cancel the kitties Mr.
Happy and give me the free cheques!

12:17.600 --> 12:20.160
And wipe that smile off your
face because I'm not buying it.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.790
I'm not buying anything. Oh yeah!

12:28.700 --> 12:30.510
So you're not gonna
spend any of that money?

12:30.930 --> 12:33.340
What about our Mall Crawl?
We're going to have a ball!

12:33.450 --> 12:35.200
You got a lot of !

12:36.080 --> 12:38.220
Relax, Dr. Seuss!

12:38.620 --> 12:41.630
Of course I'm going to do the Mall Crawl,
I'm just not going to buy anything.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.870
You know Miley, good for you.

12:44.150 --> 12:47.010
Because that way, she can take the
money and give it to the needy.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.960
For example,
I needy some new kicks.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.340
- Is that your size?
- I wouldn't know, I didn't feel it!

12:55.490 --> 12:57.670
I'm not giving the
money to anybody!

12:57.890 --> 13:01.760
Remeber when my dad gave me the emergency
credit card and I totally blew it?

13:01.960 --> 13:05.810
Not this time. I am not spending the
money on anything dad thinks is stupid.

13:05.950 --> 13:15.330
Today only, with every impanada,
get a complimentary drrrrrrr....

13:18.560 --> 13:21.710
So Miley. We all know you're
gonna say that you can do it,

13:21.740 --> 13:23.740
but then you're gonna get to the mall and

13:23.740 --> 13:27.340
you gonna see like, some earrings,
and be all like "gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme!"

13:28.940 --> 13:30.700
That's not going to happen.
You want to know why?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.660
I'm giving you my cheque book.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.030
Wow, you're serious about this.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.260
Yes I am.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.420
Oliver, a little help here!

13:41.770 --> 13:44.930
It looks this a job for
"Slippery Sam the Finger Man".

13:48.020 --> 13:49.620
And thank you Oliver,
I needed that.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.880
Oh, look who just
conveniently jogged in.

13:53.110 --> 13:56.390
Pathetic. Pretening to
stretch so he can spy on me.

13:56.690 --> 14:00.640
Well you can stretch those
hammies until they turn to
bacon, Mister, I ain't blowing it.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.980
Hey Miley! How'er you doing?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.580
So "innocent".

14:06.340 --> 14:08.670
I'm great daddy, thank you!

14:08.790 --> 14:12.820
And F.Y.I, I won't be buying a drill,
Because I have free food at home!

14:12.880 --> 14:14.330
cause I'm a smart cookie!

14:15.380 --> 14:17.310
Which I won't be buying either!

14:17.550 --> 14:21.840
Because I got it free at home!
Smart! Cookie!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.220
Okey Dokey.

14:26.570 --> 14:29.620
Check! And mate! Ha!

14:43.240 --> 14:45.960
OK, here's the charger boy,
sniff it!

14:46.180 --> 14:48.860
Sniff it good.
OK, go get the phone!

14:54.900 --> 14:58.200
No, no. Phone first.
Then you get your treat.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.820
Hey, you're costing me fifty dollars an
hour and I got a party to go to!

15:02.820 --> 15:04.820
Now come
on, no phone, no bone!

15:07.940 --> 15:09.830
You are completly worthless.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.300
Let me give you one more chance.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.150
You are a disappointment
to dogs everywhere!

15:24.320 --> 15:28.790
Hey Jackson! What are you
doing home, I thought you'd
be at your party by now.

15:29.330 --> 15:33.030
I did to. But I'm not. Why? you ask

15:34.340 --> 15:36.220
Cause my father doesn't trust me.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.180
Oh, you don't think I trust you?

15:40.560 --> 15:44.260
If you trusted me then you'd
let me go to this party without
having to check up on me.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.910
It's humiliating.
Can't you understand that?

15:53.460 --> 15:55.140
Oh yeah, I understand it.

15:55.820 --> 15:59.780
So you want me to
make an egg-ception?

16:01.130 --> 16:05.840
You want to go to this party
knowing that I'm not going to call
you to check up on
you.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.540
That'd work for me.

16:07.670 --> 16:15.390
Well OK then. Cause I sure don't
want to be "hard-boiled" about this,
"scramble" up your plans.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.170
So ar, I'm letting you go.

16:18.570 --> 16:19.730
Well great!

16:20.060 --> 16:24.720
Yep, well if my son says I can
trust him then dang flab it, I'm
take him to make his word.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.990
OK then. Bye!

16:32.690 --> 16:34.210
Unbelievable!

16:37.560 --> 16:38.630
Jackson!

16:40.230 --> 16:44.240
I lost my phone,
OK? I'm not going to the party.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.810
There's the truth. Happy?

16:46.830 --> 16:48.610
Yes I am!

16:49.670 --> 16:52.800
Yes I am? What kind
of a father are you?

16:52.810 --> 16:58.510
A proud one! You told me the truth.
And better yet - you didn't even have to!

16:58.880 --> 17:02.690
Now I know I really can trust you.
Go on to your party, son.

17:02.770 --> 17:06.910
Well thanks, dad. And I promise,
from now on, total honesty!

17:10.050 --> 17:12.670
Jackson, what is that dog
doing sitting on my couch?

17:14.250 --> 17:16.119
I have no idea! Bye!

17:19.630 --> 17:23.599
I don't know who you are. But would you
mind taking my son's cell phone out to him?

17:27.569 --> 17:29.520
If only Jackson
were that trainable.

17:39.550 --> 17:43.640
Wow. We've crawled through half
the mall and you haven't asked
for your cheque book once.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.530
Yeah, that's because
I don't need it!

17:45.580 --> 17:48.250
And you want to know something else?
It feels good not to buy anything.

17:48.480 --> 17:53.720
It's no longer be one of those weak,
spineless consumers that these malls pray
on.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.070
You guys like my new hat?
Bought five!

18:00.910 --> 18:05.170
Attention shoppers. Forty percent
off all mens sporting goods.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.290
It's like they know I'm here!

18:10.700 --> 18:13.990
I used to be like that. So sad.

18:14.180 --> 18:18.100
If only he had my strength, my will power.

18:18.100 --> 18:22.380
I mean, there is nothing in this
entire mall that could get me
to look at you and say...

18:23.110 --> 18:27.390
Yes, it's pearls by Henri.
The finest make up in the world.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.070
Give me my cheque book!

18:29.110 --> 18:30.520
Miley, you don't want to do this.

18:30.540 --> 18:36.180
But it's pearls by Henri!
The finest make up in the world! Come on!

18:36.230 --> 18:36.910
No.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.040
Lily! It's gift with purchase.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.640
The puppy dog face? Really Miley, no.you
know, You're not getting your cheque book.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.860
Fine. Keep my cheque book.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.430
I don't need it, I got
something better than money.

18:50.590 --> 18:53.360
When I'm walking around,
everybody stops.

18:53.490 --> 18:56.640
Cameras flashing,
people fighting for the best shot

18:56.910 --> 18:58.370
They like my hair...

18:59.240 --> 19:01.540
You wear this thing too long,
it'll give you a head rash.

19:01.550 --> 19:02.570
Believe me honey, I know.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.240
Oliver! I need you!

19:06.290 --> 19:08.890
Oh, I don't care if footballs
are two for one, get over here!

19:10.640 --> 19:12.790
Hello, I'm Hannah Montana,

19:12.940 --> 19:17.120
and I just wanted to know if I could get
some free samples... you know, like a
celebrity endorsement.

19:18.890 --> 19:19.960
You should be ashamed!

19:20.990 --> 19:22.050
Ouch!

19:23.610 --> 19:25.260
Miley. Look at yourself.

19:27.070 --> 19:31.170
Miley isn't here anymore!
Give me my cheque book!

19:31.630 --> 19:32.400
Eeep!

19:37.480 --> 19:39.000
- Oliver! Go deep!
- I'm open!

19:56.580 --> 19:58.230
What do you think,
a little too much?

20:10.290 --> 20:13.530
There you go, darling.
I think that got her done.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.770
You know I kind of prefer
the no make up look anyway!

20:17.590 --> 20:21.480
Daddy, stop being so nice to me,
I know you're disappointed.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.300
Just come right out and say it.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.120
Mile --

20:24.350 --> 20:27.690
Exactly! You gave me more
responsibility and I blew it.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.070
It's the credit card thing all
over again, ain't that right?

20:30.370 --> 20:33.800
Listen, darl --- I know! You would think
I'd learn by now but obviously I haven't.

20:33.820 --> 20:37.060
- You know bud, it's ...
- Dad! I get it! OK!

20:37.230 --> 20:42.360
- You don't have to go on, and on, and on ...
- I'm not disappointed in you!

20:42.440 --> 20:43.270
Go on!

20:44.060 --> 20:47.180
The only reason that you
couldn't handle this money,

20:47.180 --> 20:49.180
is because you didn't trust
yourself as much as I trust you.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.100
What?

20:51.280 --> 20:54.940
I didn't give you the five thousand dollars
wondering if you were ready for it.

20:54.990 --> 20:56.980
I gave it to you cause
I knew you were.

20:57.310 --> 21:00.460
If I was so ready, why do I
still have powder in my pits?

21:01.420 --> 21:03.970
Now that's because you didn't raise
you arms when I asked you to.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.150
This isn't funny.

21:14.660 --> 21:18.180
Mile. You've always had me
there to say no for you.

21:18.810 --> 21:22.060
But now - you've got to learn
how to say it for yourself.

21:22.370 --> 21:27.770
The problem is that you have to remember
that... sometimes it's OK to say yes.

21:28.710 --> 21:31.340
Unless you're talking about boys
then the answer's always no.

21:31.710 --> 21:32.380
Dad?!

21:32.450 --> 21:33.540
Always!

21:34.360 --> 21:38.300
I'm just saying that handling money is just
like everything else in life.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.300
You just got
to find the right balance.

21:41.030 --> 21:46.020
So you're saying it would've been OK for
me to say yes to the make up and the belt

21:46.020 --> 21:52.730
just as long as I said no to the sunglasses,
shoes and... the other belt.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.060
And the boys!
Always say no to the boys.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.750
If it gets you through
the day daddy.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.380
No, no, no. We had an
agreement and that's that.

22:10.820 --> 22:14.450
Back when I was a boy if I made a
deal with my daddy we stuck to it.

22:15.290 --> 22:19.270
Oh, now don't go giving me that puppy dog
face again because it ain't going to work!

22:21.460 --> 22:24.090
Oh all right,
but don't tell Jackson.
