This losing thing sucks.

Winning doesn't,
but the losing does.

00:26.594 --> 00:30.431
Statistically,
we should have won it.

We should have
beat that team.

Today sucks, yeah.

we're gonna look at it,

right back, men, okay?

you got a little limp?

Yeah.
Yeah, so I'm going
to get to the point

03:25.439 --> 03:27.508
where you can literally
walk in the boot and say,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.310
"You know what, you know?

Last year, when the Rams
faced the Lions,

04:33.006 --> 04:34.642
they won by 7,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.811

to a Johnson pick-six.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.815
Trumaine Johnson read the route,
jumped it,

04:41.849 --> 04:44.985
and took it
63 yards to the house.

that's nice work!

04:51.024 --> 04:52.860

04:52.893 --> 04:55.095
But in that same game,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.365
Matthew Stafford
hooked up with Golden Tate

04:57.398 --> 04:58.932
for two touchdowns.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.969
Finding a way to stop them
without Johnson

05:02.002 --> 05:05.606
is enough to keep Gregg Williams
up at night.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.348
Williams: I've looked at all
the sequential film,

05:14.382 --> 05:16.417
just watching play after play
after play

05:16.450 --> 05:17.885
of every game
they've played this year,

05:17.918 --> 05:20.087
and then go back
and watch last year --

05:20.120 --> 05:22.790
us versus the Lions.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.091
What's Stafford done?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.926
What's he thinking about?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.095
I think he's playing
the best ball I've seen him play

05:28.128 --> 05:29.763
since he's come into the league.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.833
And we're gonna have
to make him play anxiously,

05:32.866 --> 05:35.035
make him play unsettled.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.405
And hopefully we can make him
uncomfortable.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.109
15 -- he keeps on
showing up in the slot.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.813
He's an extreme threat
when he doesn't have the ball

05:45.846 --> 05:47.147
and how he can get open.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.816
And then once
he gets open in space,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.851
just has a hard time
bringing him down.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.021
He did a good job last year,
too.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.789
I love the profession.

05:55.823 --> 05:59.693
I enjoy the work part
of what we do

05:59.727 --> 06:00.928
because that's all I'm doing.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.095
I'm here.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.064
So I put in my time,

06:04.097 --> 06:07.701
and when it comes time
to nod off at night,

06:07.735 --> 06:09.670
just flip the old
inflatable mattress down

06:09.703 --> 06:13.841
on the floor and sleep here.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.677
Hamm: Before his nights

06:16.710 --> 06:18.446
camping out
at the Rams' facility,

06:18.479 --> 06:21.882
Gregg Williams spent
three seasons in New Orleans.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.018
Sean Payton's
the best offensive coach

06:25.052 --> 06:26.587
I've ever worked with.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.824
And Drew Brees is one of
the best quarterbacks

06:30.858 --> 06:32.760
I've ever been with.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.996
Hamm:
In his first year as defensive
coordinator in 2009,

06:36.029 --> 06:37.197
Williams helped lead the Saints

06:37.230 --> 06:39.032
to their first-ever
Lombardi trophy.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.001
Brees: I got it, Coach!

06:41.034 --> 06:42.870
Payton: I love it! I love it!
I love it! I love it!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.638
Williams: But in 2012,

06:44.672 --> 06:47.140
as he was preparing to join
the Rams coaching staff,

06:47.174 --> 06:50.811
he was ensnared in a scandal
called Bountygate.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.482
The Saints were accused
of paying a bonus, or bounty,

06:54.515 --> 06:57.718
to injure opposing players.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.120
Williams
was suspended indefinitely,

07:00.153 --> 07:02.590
but reinstated after a year.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.857
Williams: This is me.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.926
I knew you'd have
to bring it up.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.896
Bounty hunter returns.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.598
The bounties are gone,

07:10.631 --> 07:14.067
but Williams' love
of aggressive play remains.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.202
Hit it!

07:15.235 --> 07:16.937
Downhill! Good!

07:16.970 --> 07:18.739
It's a quality shared by

07:18.772 --> 07:21.141
his offensive counterpart
Rob Boras...

07:21.174 --> 07:23.176
Again, time clock!

07:23.210 --> 07:24.578
Hamm:
...who's in his first full year

07:24.612 --> 07:25.479
as offensive coordinator.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.214
...time clocks!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.716
There's no time clock

07:28.749 --> 07:30.984
on the path to greatness, okay?

07:31.018 --> 07:34.021
There's no time clock, okay?

07:34.054 --> 07:36.223
So make sure, when we get
on the plane today

07:36.256 --> 07:38.726
or tomorrow morning
or tomorrow night,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.160
Sunday morning,

07:40.193 --> 07:42.930
we're still in our book
working on this plan.

07:42.963 --> 07:43.997
Okay?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.966
...time clocks.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.636
We've got to make sure
that we are staying on top of

07:48.669 --> 07:51.505
what we've got to
take care of right now.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.841
So avoid the distractions,
get in your book,

07:53.874 --> 07:56.544
challenge each other.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.911
Hut, hut!

07:57.945 --> 07:59.747
Hamm: If the Rams have
any chance of improving,

07:59.780 --> 08:02.616
Case Keenum has to avoid
the killer turnover

08:02.650 --> 08:06.654
like last week's pick-six
against Buffalo.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.022
Shoot!

08:09.056 --> 08:11.058
And the depleted defense

08:11.091 --> 08:13.226
has to avoid the big play.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.531
Williams: Right!
That's where we want it!

08:17.565 --> 08:19.099
Good!

08:19.132 --> 08:21.602
Williams: And we'll get Trumaine
back as fast as possible,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.303
but you've got to have
a next-man-up philosophy too,

08:23.336 --> 08:24.838
and I have that philosophy.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.273
The next man up's got
to be ready to go,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.609
and that's why
we don't --

08:28.642 --> 08:31.111
If you're -- I don't like
that word, "starter."

08:31.144 --> 08:32.780
Everybody's a starter.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.582
If you make the team,
you got to be ready to go.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.116
If you're a starter,
you're going to play.
Yeah.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.286
So the next man up
has got to come in here,

08:39.319 --> 08:41.188
and we've got to adapt
a few things to them,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.224
but they got to be able
to join in, too.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.226
There are only so many times
you can say,

08:46.259 --> 08:47.795
"Next man up"

08:47.828 --> 08:50.631
without your defense
falling apart.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.835
Williams:
Can somebody cover Tay? Huh?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.838
We got to make people
kick field goals!

08:57.871 --> 09:01.274
They're down here
in field-goal range!

09:01.308 --> 09:05.278
My drops, my eyes,
my interests, my run gap,

09:05.312 --> 09:06.880
everything is about

09:06.914 --> 09:08.882
getting off the field
on third down

09:08.916 --> 09:11.318
and forcing a field goal!

09:11.351 --> 09:13.787
Let's make sure
we understand that, okay?

09:13.821 --> 09:15.723
We'll win a bunch of games

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
when we make them
kick field goals.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.159
Here we go.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.663
Let's go, team!
Let's go!

09:22.696 --> 09:24.297
Outside!

09:24.331 --> 09:26.166
Let's go!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.035
Oh!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.737
Oh!

09:29.770 --> 09:31.304
Oh!

09:31.338 --> 09:33.073
You're full of...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.075

they'll win the game.

he gets a chance

that wins are what matter

on the starting job.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.532
I want to hit him
like this.

Boom!

[ Laughs ]

31:11.270 --> 31:12.905
He ain't gonna
do that.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.273
I ain't going to step on him,
but I'm going to hit him.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.008
I ain't gonna hit him
like that?

31:16.042 --> 31:17.376
You'll step right on him.
I ain't going to step on him.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.644
I'm gonna step over him.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.112
Hey, do it again.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.381
What if Eli says,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.550
"...you...you,
...you...you, hut!"

31:24.583 --> 31:26.252
and goes?

31:26.285 --> 31:28.220
And we're in the middle
of talking?

31:28.254 --> 31:30.489
So we've got to beat them
into a stance,

31:30.522 --> 31:32.458
beat them into what we want.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.093
It has to be done
in a hurry!

Here we go.

Donald:
You ain't never hear me...
about getting double-teamed.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.332
I don't hear you.
I just see it in the paper.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.134
When?
You were whining
in the paper.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.669
No, I did not. When?
You were whining.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.238
You were whining to some
reporter about being doubled.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.008
I never ever,
ever complained.
I'll get the article.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.111
Fight me right now.

The truth --

31:55.547 --> 31:57.183
Fight me.
The truth hurts.

My knuckles are
getting ready to buckle.

Hamm: Whether or not
the Giants double Donald,

32:17.069 --> 32:18.971
the Rams plan to pay
special attention

32:19.005 --> 32:21.307
to Odell Beckham,
number 13,

32:21.340 --> 32:23.675
one of those most dangerous
receivers in the league.

Good-bye, Beckham!

When that young man

32:35.321 --> 32:36.588
gets his hands
on the football,

32:36.622 --> 32:38.324
it is exciting.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.265
Now, we're gonna "X"
13 wherever he's at.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.666
Taking the double to him.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.269
It comes in LAX,
we're doubling 13.

He's at the X,
cut the...

32:51.637 --> 32:53.372
He's in the slot,

If he's in at Z, go ahead
and make your rocket and laser.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.176
This is a very
talented individual.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.710
You guys know that,
all right?

32:58.744 --> 33:00.646
But he's a very selfish guy

33:00.679 --> 33:02.114
in the sense that if
he's not getting the ball,

33:02.148 --> 33:03.682
he's not very interested,
all right?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.251
We got to make sure
we take care of him.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.752
He's going to pop off.
He's going to talk.

We've got to be mature
enough not to fall into it.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.290
Williams: Walk away.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.625
And I talked about
the power of the mind

33:13.659 --> 33:16.362
over the power of the body.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.631
And when you are

33:19.665 --> 33:23.635
knocking the dog...
out of a grown man

33:23.669 --> 33:26.272
and look him in the eye
and walk away

because he can't do anything,

your beard up.

the practice report.

I had to change Odell

I'll play him."

and be happy

from the heart, number one.

say too much in the huddles

34:57.529 --> 34:59.198
or nothing like that,

34:59.231 --> 35:00.766
but, you know,
I do consider myself

35:00.799 --> 35:03.469
one of these captains
of the punt return team.

And this is
the God's honest truth.

in the league

punt return in the league,

35:10.742 --> 35:12.711
the best punter,
the best kicker

35:12.744 --> 35:15.647

and best kick return.

the God's honest truth, bro.

I want us to do.

Thursday night, late --
or what they're doing today,

40:03.702 --> 40:05.804
Announcer #2: He's just so quick
and so dangerous

40:05.837 --> 40:07.172
with the ball in his hands.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.640
We're just
getting started, baby,

40:08.674 --> 40:10.041
just getting started,
huh?
Yeah.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.810
Got all kinds of...in there.
Let's go.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.547
Okay, you're gonna have to
take a shot here, okay?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.048
They look tired.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.218
They're...so tired,
they're gonna go right back.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.888
Hamm:
The Rams look a step quicker,

40:22.921 --> 40:25.557
Keenum and his receivers
in sync.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.926
But it all unravels
in an instant.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.761
Announcer #1:
Now takes the shotgun snap.

40:29.795 --> 40:30.996
As the pocket collapses,
he throws.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.631
Tavon tipped up.

40:32.664 --> 40:33.499
Austin: No, no, no!

40:33.532 --> 40:35.501
It's intercepted!

40:35.534 --> 40:38.136
Landon Collins, 45, 40.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.905
Cuts back, 35!

40:39.938 --> 40:42.474
Reversing near side
of the field!

40:42.508 --> 40:45.110
Still on his feet
as he hits his 25!

40:46.512 --> 40:48.880
Landon Collins gliding
for the end zone.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.181
It's a pick-six!

40:50.215 --> 40:54.019
And the Giants will
have a PAT to tie it.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.156
Announcer #2:
Case Keenum will get

40:58.189 --> 41:00.191
discredited
for that pick-six,

41:00.225 --> 41:03.929
but the ball was perfectly
thrown to Tavon Austin.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.664
It went
right through his hands.

41:05.697 --> 41:06.898
Dales:
Coach, you had all the momentum

41:06.932 --> 41:08.266
to start
this football game.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.868
How do you shift
this thing back?

41:09.901 --> 41:11.537
Yeah, I mean, that was
a big play for them, you know.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.938
We got the turnover
early in the game

41:12.971 --> 41:14.072
and capitalized on that.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.273
That was a big play for them.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.875
You know, right now,
we can't let up

41:16.908 --> 41:18.610
because any time
Eli's under their center,

41:18.644 --> 41:19.778
he's going to make plays.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.517
Boras: This has got to be us
this half, right?

41:25.551 --> 41:26.918
That...wasn't good
enough right there.

41:26.952 --> 41:30.088
-Right.
-Okay? That's not good enough!

41:30.121 --> 41:31.957
All right?
Take care of the football!

41:31.990 --> 41:33.692
Let's get lined up!

41:33.725 --> 41:35.994
Let's play with some
...tempo right now

41:36.027 --> 41:37.696
and finish this
...game!

41:37.729 --> 41:39.565
We said 60 minutes!

41:39.598 --> 41:42.233
We have not played
to our ability those first 30.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.902
We got a chance right now

41:43.935 --> 41:46.572
to redeem ourselves
these next 30 minutes!

41:46.605 --> 41:47.773
It's 0-0!

41:47.806 --> 41:49.975
We decide
how we do right now!

41:50.008 --> 41:51.810
We...decide!

41:51.843 --> 41:53.545
We ready to go?
-Yes, sir.

41:53.579 --> 41:54.946
Let's pound it
where we got to pound it,

41:54.980 --> 41:57.282
protect and finish!

41:57.315 --> 41:58.584
**

41:58.617 --> 42:00.018
Hamm:
The Rams offense,

42:00.051 --> 42:01.853
encouraging
at the start of the game,

42:01.887 --> 42:03.188
suddenly looks lost.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.058
Keenum: Set! Go!

42:07.092 --> 42:11.162
Hamm:
Todd Gurley is stymied again.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.832
And Keenum begins to misfire.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.266
Announcer #1:
Keenum has time to throw.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.602
Over the middle,
tipped.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.903
It's intercepted!

42:20.105 --> 42:21.673
Announcer #2:
Johnny on the spot again.

42:21.707 --> 42:24.576
Landon Collins come up
with his second pick.

42:24.610 --> 42:25.844
Wow.

42:27.178 --> 42:28.346
Keenum: Set!

42:28.379 --> 42:29.948
Keenum, again, to throw.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.349
Has a nice pocket.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.752
Wings one down the left side
looking for Austin.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.654
Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie

42:35.687 --> 42:37.923
makes the interception
in the end zone.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.960
Hayes: Hey!
We got to get some points!

42:41.993 --> 42:43.161
Let's go, man!

42:43.194 --> 42:44.930
Let's go!

42:44.963 --> 42:47.332
The score stays the same
in four-minute mode.

42:47.365 --> 42:49.167
In four -- okay?

42:49.200 --> 42:52.237
Four-minute mode,
we got to rock their world.

42:52.270 --> 42:55.707
Hamm: The good news is they're
holding Odell Beckham in check.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.945
Even without injured
cornerback Trumaine Johnson,

42:59.978 --> 43:03.615
the Rams limit Beckham to just
27 yards through three quarters.

43:08.353 --> 43:12.290
Hey, O.B., you know damn well
you didn't catch that, boy.

43:12.323 --> 43:15.126
Be good. Keep playing
the way y'all playing.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.663
You all playing good enough
to win this game!

43:17.696 --> 43:19.798
Hamm:
But it only takes one play

43:19.831 --> 43:22.067
for a superstar
to change a game.

43:23.869 --> 43:25.336
Announcer #1: Eli takes the snap
and retreats,

43:25.370 --> 43:28.073
throws off his back foot,
looking for Odell.

43:28.106 --> 43:31.242
It's brought in at the 6!

43:31.276 --> 43:34.680
Odell Beckham, between two Rams,
brought it in.

43:34.713 --> 43:37.015
It's first and goal,
New York.

43:37.048 --> 43:38.183
Manning: Blue 80! Set!

43:38.216 --> 43:39.718
He hands off.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.720
Jennings finds his way in

43:41.753 --> 43:44.690
for the go-ahead score.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.058
Two interceptions
by Case Keenum

43:47.092 --> 43:51.296
resulted in the Giants'
only touchdowns of this game.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.365
**

43:55.967 --> 43:57.969
So with two timeouts
and down by 7,

43:58.003 --> 43:59.437
3:03 to go,
here comes Case Keenum --

43:59.470 --> 44:01.907
first and 10 at his 25.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.241
Here we go.
Here we go.

44:05.210 --> 44:08.246
Announcer #2: Case Keenum here
can undo all that

44:08.279 --> 44:10.048
if you go down there

44:10.081 --> 44:11.783
and you lead
a two-minute drill touchdown.

44:11.817 --> 44:13.819
Hamm:
For the third straight week,

44:13.852 --> 44:16.755
the game comes down
to the final drive.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.857
It all rests
in Keenum's hands.

44:18.890 --> 44:20.025
It's complete.

44:20.058 --> 44:22.427
Kendricks, his tight end
up to the 35.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.196
Swings it left side.

44:25.230 --> 44:26.431
Gurley out of the backfield,
juggling it!

44:26.464 --> 44:28.033
Brings it in!

44:29.300 --> 44:31.803
Fourth down and 10,
a must-get for the Rams

44:31.837 --> 44:34.005
from their own 36.

44:35.473 --> 44:38.143
Complete!
First down at midfield!

44:38.176 --> 44:41.713
Let's go! Come on!
And the Rams are alive!

44:41.747 --> 44:42.748
Keenum: Set!

44:42.781 --> 44:44.315
Giants rush four.

44:44.349 --> 44:46.752
Keenum, as he's hit, throws.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.253
and it's caught
near sideline

44:48.286 --> 44:50.188
at the 27-yard line!

44:50.221 --> 44:51.957
It's Quick again!

44:51.990 --> 44:53.759
The Rams have not had
a touchdown

44:53.792 --> 44:55.193
since their opening drive.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.394
They have to have one here.

44:56.427 --> 44:57.863
Keenum: Set!

44:57.896 --> 44:59.430
Keenum takes the shotgun snap
and drops.

44:59.464 --> 45:00.866
Throw to the end zone.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.233
Incomplete.

45:02.267 --> 45:03.935
Oh.

45:03.969 --> 45:06.905
Bradley Marquez did not
get his head around.

45:06.938 --> 45:09.374
He had a touchdown.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.112
And so with 50 seconds
on the clock,

45:14.145 --> 45:17.282
the Rams still looking
for the tying touchdown.

45:17.315 --> 45:20.385
**

45:20.418 --> 45:22.153
Case Keenum
and this L.A. offense

45:22.187 --> 45:26.925
trying to overcome
a three-interception performance

45:26.958 --> 45:29.027
and get away with the win.

45:32.864 --> 45:35.100
Keenum pointing at his helmet
with both hands.

45:35.133 --> 45:36.835
Here comes the blitz.

45:36.868 --> 45:39.404
He gets the throw out,
lofted ball to the end zone.

45:39.437 --> 45:42.774
An easy pick for
Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.

45:42.808 --> 45:44.309
-Oh, no.
-What the --

45:44.342 --> 45:47.178
McDonald: ...

45:47.212 --> 45:49.047
And that'll do it.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.484
Announcer #2:
Total miscommunication.

45:53.518 --> 45:56.955
You saw Keenum
give a signal to Quick.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.824
Keenum saw the blitz
coming.

45:58.857 --> 46:02.093
So he's going to throw the ball
to the one-on-one coverage.

46:02.127 --> 46:05.396
Quick decides not to run
the fly pattern.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.198
Broke off his route.

46:07.232 --> 46:10.168
Keenum knew it was a pick
as soon as he threw it.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.003
He's got two hands
on his knees

46:12.037 --> 46:14.372
back at the 25-yard line.

46:14.405 --> 46:17.442
**

46:21.479 --> 46:23.414
How about the Rams?

46:23.448 --> 46:28.353
They've lost three straight
after winning three straight.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.856
And you wonder,
with the bye week coming,

46:30.889 --> 46:33.591
and a four-interception
performance by Case,

46:33.624 --> 46:37.162
does the Jared Goff era
begin in week 9?

46:37.195 --> 46:40.231

46:43.501 --> 46:47.205
Fisher: You want to hear what it
...feels like to win?

46:47.238 --> 46:50.909
Step outside the hallway
and listen to their locker room.

46:50.942 --> 46:53.478
That's how it feels.

46:53.511 --> 46:56.047
We haven't felt that
in three...weeks!

46:56.081 --> 46:57.916
And we beat ourselves

46:57.949 --> 47:00.886
because there was too many
...mistakes out there!

47:00.919 --> 47:03.454
So you want to start
figuring out what it
feels like to win,

47:03.488 --> 47:05.323
then take your break

47:05.356 --> 47:07.292
and get your ass...back here
after the bye week

47:07.325 --> 47:10.528
and start winning
...football games.

pick up the wreckage

47:15.166 --> 47:17.502

heartbreaking losses.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.437
If there's any consolation,

47:19.470 --> 47:22.908
it's that a very long road trip
is finally over.

47:22.941 --> 47:26.044
The bye week is here.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.979
Two days of film review

to let this sink it,

47:39.090 --> 47:40.458
digest it, whatever.

Ten hours on a flight,
12 hours on a flight,

47:42.527 --> 47:45.030
long flight.

47:45.063 --> 47:48.934
And everybody's
disappointed, right?

47:48.967 --> 47:52.070
Everybody's disappointed
in where we are, right?

47:52.103 --> 47:57.642
At 3-1, did you think
we'd be sitting here 3-4?

47:59.945 --> 48:01.947
Did you think that?

48:01.980 --> 48:03.081
Anybody?

Anybody?

48:06.651 --> 48:08.153
No.

48:08.186 --> 48:10.021
Fisher: Basically,
what's permeating through

48:10.055 --> 48:11.589
the staff
in the building right now is,

48:11.622 --> 48:13.124
"You know what?

48:13.158 --> 48:17.162
We're a couple plays away
from being 5-2

48:17.195 --> 48:19.430
rather than 3-4."

48:19.464 --> 48:22.100
There's some really good stuff.

48:22.133 --> 48:23.301
I mean,
you don't turn the ball over

48:23.334 --> 48:24.469
four times in a game

48:24.502 --> 48:26.471
and lose by 7.

48:26.504 --> 48:29.640
Something's
got to be going on.

48:29.674 --> 48:33.178
Good things have
to be happening, okay?

48:33.211 --> 48:34.980
And they are.

48:35.013 --> 48:40.986
It's a matter of you guys
assuming the 5-2 personality

48:41.019 --> 48:42.287
and moving forward

48:42.320 --> 48:44.089
rather than
the 3-4 personality,

48:44.122 --> 48:46.057
because that's how
you get out of these things.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.993
And that's what
we got to do, okay?

48:48.026 --> 48:51.562
So search your soul,
your heart,

48:51.596 --> 48:55.300
get away, recover,
and then let's go.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.735
We'll go.
We'll take it one at a time.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.404

48:59.437 --> 49:00.671

The four-game losing streak

are we pleased

49:22.027 --> 49:23.694
with the offensive production
the last three weeks.

49:23.728 --> 49:26.164
Being the quarterback,
to have that responsibility,

49:26.197 --> 49:28.733
have the ball in my hands,
I take it heavily on myself.

49:28.766 --> 49:30.335

Coach Fisher, walks in,

49:30.368 --> 49:32.303
tells both me and Case

handled it really well.

It was kind of a surprise to me.
