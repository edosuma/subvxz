by taking it any further.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.583
You okay?

19:11.583 --> 19:14.186
Oh, yeah. No, I just--
I wasn't listening.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.823
I was too busy checking out
the Twin-denburgs there.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.824
Oh, the humanity.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.593
Look, Russell,
I know how you feel.

19:21.593 --> 19:25.063
Well, I wouldn't mind
knowing how those feel.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.699
I know you're covering,
but you crossed the line.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.202
Oh, hey, I'm getting a text.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.937
It's this chick Tina.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.138
She's got a pottery wheel,

19:33.138 --> 19:36.542
wants to do
a little Ghost action.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.878
So...I'm gonna cruise.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.485
And for the Robinson's
housewarming,

19:46.485 --> 19:48.187
give them the Crock-Pot.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.358
I'm not waiting eight hours
to eat anything.

19:53.158 --> 19:55.093
All right,
this isn't too bad.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.395
We've assigned gifts to people

19:56.395 --> 19:57.496
who invited us
to their parties.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.266
Yeah, we still have all those
leftover for us.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.367
Mm.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.273

20:08.106 --> 20:09.941
Mine.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.978
Also mine.

20:13.345 --> 20:17.349
Well, at least we still have
the six-slice toaster.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.150
Six-slice?

20:20.686 --> 20:21.687
It's mine.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.563
I don't know.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.599
Maybe it was love,

20:33.599 --> 20:36.268
maybe it wasn't.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.370
Do I have regrets?

20:38.370 --> 20:39.170
A few,

20:39.170 --> 20:44.109
but all in all it's better
to have loved and lost.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.677
Am I right?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.879
Catch.

20:47.879 --> 20:48.880
Catch.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.317
It's like a one-track mind
with you.

20:51.317 --> 20:55.787
I don't know why I'm talking
to you about this anyway.
