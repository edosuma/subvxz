00:57.823 --> 01:00.224
What the hell are you doing?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.293
Do you want to get
us all killed?

01:02.295 --> 01:04.328
She wants to be let out.

01:04.331 --> 01:08.565
Don't let it inside
your head, do you hear me?

01:08.567 --> 01:11.302
Get moving, you miserable scum.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.880
Your men always tire so easily.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.615
We haven't stopped, Minister,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.883
not for two days and nights.

01:25.885 --> 01:29.654
And we won't, not until
this thing's been dealt with.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.257
Can't we destroy it now, here?

01:32.259 --> 01:35.262
We take it across the
border as planned.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.270
Halt.

01:45.871 --> 01:48.873
You there, what business
do you have here?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.550
Get down here now.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.485
But my dear fellow,

02:01.487 --> 02:04.454
the view from up here
is so much better.

02:05.658 --> 02:09.594
If we cannot be of assistance
to our dear British ally,

02:09.596 --> 02:12.930
then I politely ask
you be on your way.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.444
She knows what you are planning.

02:25.277 --> 02:26.877
What are you talking about?

02:26.879 --> 02:29.216
She won't let it happen.

02:37.389 --> 02:38.822
Come!

02:38.824 --> 02:40.293
Let me show you!

03:08.888 --> 03:10.020
Forward, men!

03:18.497 --> 03:20.597
Stay down, there's too many!

03:35.514 --> 03:37.281
Peter, lower further.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.520
Peter!

03:40.620 --> 03:43.488
Peter, what are you doing?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.354
Peter?

04:04.544 --> 04:05.546
Halt!

04:49.122 --> 04:50.855
Brendan, it's for you.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.426
I'm in a meeting.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.562
How was your imaginary meeting?

04:57.564 --> 04:59.930
Terrible, too
many interruptions.

05:02.701 --> 05:04.868
Is that one of your mother's?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.803
Just deciding what to keep.

05:06.805 --> 05:09.008
Keep that one,
looks good on you.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.877
So, the reason I
summoned you here,

05:12.879 --> 05:15.046
oh, Stepfather of
mine, is that the man

05:15.048 --> 05:18.449
who just called sounded
very eager to talk to you.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.422
Strange, I don't think
I owe anyone money.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.055
You should call him back.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.757
Did you get his number?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.091
Ooh, very professional.

05:28.093 --> 05:29.793
Get what you pay for.

05:44.576 --> 05:47.014
Hello, this is Dr.
Brendan Cole, you called?

05:47.781 --> 05:50.751
Yeah, and what would the
purpose of the meeting be?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.918
Well, if you're not gonna tell
me what it's in relation to

05:53.920 --> 05:56.056
or even who I'm to meet,
then I can hardly...

06:10.069 --> 06:11.569
What are you working on?

06:11.571 --> 06:12.502
Nothing.

06:12.504 --> 06:14.438
Oh, go on.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.906
Look, I know you think
it's a load of rubbish,

06:15.908 --> 06:19.444
but you have to admit,
it's a good story.

06:19.446 --> 06:23.914
Ah, yes, the terrible tale
of The Inferno Princess.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.450
Famous round campfires
the world over.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.151
As long as you
don't buy into it,

06:27.153 --> 06:28.786
you can draw it all you like.

06:28.788 --> 06:29.986
Don't worry, I've red your book.

06:29.988 --> 06:32.459
She's just a myth, I get it.

06:52.110 --> 06:53.543
Am I correct in saying

06:53.545 --> 06:55.212
that you are the
foremost authority

06:55.214 --> 06:57.647
on the work of
Alexander Maclntosh?

06:57.649 --> 06:59.082
Yes, as a matter of fact,

06:59.084 --> 07:00.918
I've just published my
third book on the man.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.887
I hope it will help to
debunk this obsession with...

07:03.889 --> 07:08.726
The Inferno Princess, yes,
I know, I've read your book.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.027
It's how I came upon you.

07:11.029 --> 07:13.599
Fact or fiction, Dr. Cole?

07:17.937 --> 07:21.272
And tell me, my dear,
do you know the story?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.242
A little, I mean, I
know it's just a story,

07:24.244 --> 07:27.911
but I think it's really cool.

07:27.913 --> 07:30.616
It's one of my favorites, may I?

07:32.218 --> 07:36.187
The legend started in
1763 with a general

07:36.189 --> 07:39.957
renown for his victories
in service of my family.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.959
The general had a daughter
whose beauty was known

07:41.961 --> 07:45.930
throughout the kingdom,
her name was Talia.

07:45.932 --> 07:50.237
But the general called her
Princess, his princess.

07:51.036 --> 07:54.605
So terrified was he by
the thought of losing her

07:54.607 --> 07:56.873
that he commissioned
a clockwork doll

07:56.875 --> 07:58.642
to be made in her image.

07:58.644 --> 08:03.147
She was to be the most marvelous
automaton ever imagined.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.649
Through this perfect creation,

08:05.651 --> 08:09.252
his daughter would
become immortal.

08:09.254 --> 08:13.125
Forever young, forever
beautiful, forever his.

08:13.992 --> 08:17.027
At first, the doll
drew great acclaim

08:17.029 --> 08:20.697
and brought untold joy
to the doting father.

08:20.699 --> 08:23.968
But there soon followed
a great tragedy.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.605
Talia went missing,
never to be found.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.873
The general in his
profound grief

08:29.875 --> 08:33.009
could not be separated
from the doll.

08:33.010 --> 08:35.946
For days he remained by its side

08:35.948 --> 08:38.948
until one morning
he was found dead.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.953
But that was just the beginning.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.690
One by one, all who had
come to love the princess

08:45.692 --> 08:48.224
fell victim to her curse.

08:48.226 --> 08:51.896
Those noble courtiers who
had so cheerfully marveled

08:51.898 --> 08:55.632
at it only weeks
before now perished.

08:55.634 --> 08:59.302
Whole families succumbed
to suicide, madness,

08:59.304 --> 09:02.706
and murderous debaucheries
so unspeakable

09:02.708 --> 09:05.943
that my ancestors
buried all records.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.677
Only when it was ordered

09:07.679 --> 09:11.681
that this Inferno
Princess be destroyed

09:11.683 --> 09:16.119
that the cursed creation unveil
its greatest act of wonder,

09:16.121 --> 09:20.326
vanishing out of sight,
never to be seen again.

09:21.827 --> 09:22.828
Until now.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.769
Rose,

09:29.902 --> 09:31.901
would you give us
a moment alone?

09:41.380 --> 09:43.049
And Dr. Cole,

09:44.182 --> 09:45.351
I need your help.

09:46.385 --> 09:50.387
And for years I believed
that the Inferno Princess

09:50.389 --> 09:53.791
had somehow found its
way back to its creator.

09:53.793 --> 09:57.728
Alexander Maclntosh had
hidden it in the same place

09:57.730 --> 10:00.097
he had forced to hide
his Catholic faith,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.931
in an underground chapel,

10:01.933 --> 10:05.136
found at last under the
ruins of a mansion

10:05.138 --> 10:08.272
built and rebuilt over the ages.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.211
All those years, the
basement chapel survived,

10:13.145 --> 10:16.914
undisturbed and undiscovered,

10:16.916 --> 10:19.382
until now.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.060
Yes, but where?

10:32.264 --> 10:35.999
Dr. Cole, we are standing on it.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.242
What, you can't
be talking about...

10:53.351 --> 10:54.819
Is this some kind of a joke?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.854
This is exactly why I chose you.

10:57.856 --> 10:59.989
I want you to authenticate her.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.864
You have the wrong
man, I'm sorry.

11:07.866 --> 11:10.468
But there is just no
way the thing is real.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.970
One week, one million pounds.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.515
Perhaps you'd like to meet her

11:24.517 --> 11:27.151
before you make up your mind.

11:31.423 --> 11:32.989
Please.

11:32.991 --> 11:34.961
Sorry, I heard music.

11:40.133 --> 11:44.171
I present to you the
Inferno Princess.

11:53.946 --> 11:58.382
Let's say for a moment she's
not what I believe she is.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.452
Then what is she?

12:00.886 --> 12:03.022
You're not intrigued
to find out?

12:04.289 --> 12:06.556
But it can't be.

12:13.331 --> 12:15.299
I have
assembled some documents

12:15.301 --> 12:19.804
from my family records,
for your eyes only.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.506
They describe the
unveiling of the doll

12:22.508 --> 12:25.876
and the five incredible
deeds she performed.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.278
Get her to repeat
these functions

12:28.280 --> 12:30.247
and you will get your money.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.248
You haven't been able to do it?

12:32.250 --> 12:37.256
We tried of course, but
she would not perform for us.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.961
Perhaps she will for you.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.028
Still think it's a fake?

13:24.437 --> 13:26.139
Still, easily forged.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.476
Till tomorrow, Princess.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.081
It began shortly
after the passing

13:38.083 --> 13:41.384
of our beloved comrade,
General Ernest Von Haugwitz

13:41.386 --> 13:46.058
when his aid to camp, Officer
Wurzel was found dead,

13:47.894 --> 13:48.894
murdered.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.113
Someone, something...

14:08.413 --> 14:10.647
Had ripped his tongue
from his head.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.617
No such suspicion was
yet placed upon the doll.

14:16.254 --> 14:18.388
It was superstitious
times, Rose.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.157
We have to take these
reports with a pinch of salt.

14:21.159 --> 14:23.026
What does yours say?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.297
Let's find out, shall we?

14:25.298 --> 14:29.132
As personal doctor to His
Highness, Frederick II,

14:29.134 --> 14:31.969
I have pleaded that the
Inferno Princess be removed

14:31.971 --> 14:35.171
from the palace to spare our
king from the evil scourge

14:35.173 --> 14:37.543
that has so affected
the nobles of our court

14:40.046 --> 14:42.515
since the unveiling
of this doll.

14:43.581 --> 14:47.151
Those attending have been
plagued by a strange malady,

14:47.153 --> 14:50.421
a sickness of the mind that
has caused untold misery.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.522
All of them claimed
to be haunted

14:52.524 --> 14:55.059
by a voice urging
them to do harm,

14:55.061 --> 14:58.431
that they are being watched in
the night by an unseen devil.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.068
I did it for you, my princess.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.637
Here's another one
from the doctor.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.475
I don't want you
to get nightmares.

15:09.674 --> 15:12.642
Lady Sophie was found drowned

15:12.644 --> 15:15.081
this morning in a lake
in the palace grounds.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.751
She was discovered by a guard

15:20.753 --> 15:23.119
who now stands accused
of her murder,

15:23.121 --> 15:25.589
weighing to a
reason of judgment,

15:25.591 --> 15:28.224
or perhaps our cowardice,

15:28.226 --> 15:32.662
we prefer to believe this
over his terrifying testimony.

15:40.538 --> 15:44.742
The Military Court
has found you guilty

15:44.744 --> 15:46.312
of the charge of murder,

15:48.147 --> 15:51.985
and I sentence you to
death by firing squad.

15:55.153 --> 15:59.123
Do you have any last
words, you filthy dog?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.557
I have told you,
sir, I am innocent.

16:01.559 --> 16:04.096
I would never have
hurt The Lady Sophie.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.796
It was the devil
by the lake, sir!

16:06.798 --> 16:08.367
Devil by the lake!

16:10.068 --> 16:13.170
Even now, before God himself,

16:13.172 --> 16:15.539
you perpetuate this, this lie!

16:15.541 --> 16:17.273
I did not do it!

16:30.589 --> 16:34.194
The only devil you
need fear now...

16:36.294 --> 16:39.363
Is me.

16:43.201 --> 16:44.734
What are you doing?

16:52.644 --> 16:54.310
Present!

16:59.184 --> 17:00.185
Aim!

17:03.556 --> 17:04.557
Fire!

17:12.097 --> 17:14.198
He claims that as he brought

17:14.200 --> 17:16.632
the poor girl out of the water,

17:16.634 --> 17:21.374
he saw another watching
silently, stoic.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.178
A woman who moved
like clockwork.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.048
Shit, that's creepy.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.253
The first action exhibited

17:36.255 --> 17:39.690
by the General's creation
was hardly remarkable,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.792
but was nevertheless
demonstrated

17:41.794 --> 17:44.393
with a level of dramatic flair.

17:44.395 --> 17:47.264
Maclntosh, a rose
between his teeth,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.232
first knelt before the doll.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.170
She did not respond to this.

17:52.270 --> 17:54.203
But, hitherto?

17:54.205 --> 17:55.271
Hitherto.

17:55.273 --> 17:58.408
Hitherto, he placed a
hand upon the doll's arm,

17:58.410 --> 18:02.148
in some way priming the thing
to raise her hand for a kiss.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.531
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:21.834 --> 18:23.169
Your Highness,

18:24.903 --> 18:28.404
today shall be unveiled
a true beauty,

18:28.406 --> 18:31.443
the most advanced
automaton ever conceived,

18:32.111 --> 18:36.549
a symbol of the enlightened
minds of its creator,

18:37.449 --> 18:39.182
and patron.

18:48.527 --> 18:51.460
And on this momentous occasion,

18:51.462 --> 18:56.333
she will perform for you
a variety of talents...

18:56.335 --> 18:58.605
As might befit a lady...

19:00.205 --> 19:01.573
Of polite society.

19:02.974 --> 19:05.676
I present to you,

19:05.678 --> 19:08.211
the Immortal Princess.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.532
But how may we rouse
the sleeping beauty?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.800
Perhaps with a rose?

19:32.503 --> 19:35.340
Which I just so
happen to possess.

19:46.884 --> 19:51.321
Or is perhaps a little
manipulation required?

20:30.328 --> 20:31.394
Let's see.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.858
You have to do it properly.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.566
Still got it.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.669
Don't forget about me.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.509
How did you know to
touch her right arm?

22:25.978 --> 22:27.978
Alexander was left handed.

22:27.980 --> 22:28.980
Like you.

22:31.849 --> 22:32.748
You're drawing me.

22:32.750 --> 22:33.717
Do you mind?

22:33.719 --> 22:34.683
Show me.

22:34.685 --> 22:35.687
It's not finished.

22:36.821 --> 22:38.357
You'll see it when it's done.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.861
Supposing for a
moment that this story is true,

22:44.863 --> 22:47.764
why did he take her,
why bring her here?

22:47.766 --> 22:48.801
You mean Alexander?

22:49.634 --> 22:52.501
The doll disappears,
and ended up back

22:52.503 --> 22:55.107
with its creator, but in secret.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.877
And after that, neither
of them are seen again.

22:59.845 --> 23:03.447
Alexander disappeared
right before the fire.

23:03.449 --> 23:07.387
Maybe he died in
the fire, all alone.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.023
In
the dark with her.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.459
I'm not convinced.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.126
Of what?

23:17.128 --> 23:18.527
Any of it.

23:18.529 --> 23:19.830
But the documents.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.532
Easily forged, and
as for the doll...

23:22.534 --> 23:23.669
She's amazing.

23:24.869 --> 23:25.871
She's something.

23:32.743 --> 23:35.480
You are keeping secrets from me.

24:36.741 --> 24:37.742
Rose?

25:04.836 --> 25:09.139
My love, come, my love.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.222
That does not belong to you!

28:14.859 --> 28:16.825
Thank you...

28:16.827 --> 28:18.128
Daddy.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.911
Rose?

28:37.949 --> 28:38.981
Why did I get...

28:38.983 --> 28:41.250
Finally decided to join us?

28:41.252 --> 28:43.819
I found you like
that this morning.

28:43.821 --> 28:45.356
Seems you're sleepwalking again.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.991
I made you coffee.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.393
I hope I didn't do
anything embarrassing.

28:51.395 --> 28:53.129
Not that I'm aware of.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.469
Although, I'm sure I caught
the princess blushing.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.270
You should have woken me.

29:01.272 --> 29:03.775
No, thanks, you know
how grumpy you get.

29:05.009 --> 29:08.010
Anyway, I'm off to
get some fresh air.

29:08.012 --> 29:10.113
Have fun with our dear Talia.

29:28.532 --> 29:33.303
Not only does the Princess
possess a devastating beauty,

29:33.305 --> 29:36.940
she also boasts a
brilliant mind.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.843
To display for you
her keen interest

29:39.845 --> 29:42.845
in literature and the arts,

29:42.847 --> 29:45.917
she will now transcribe
for you a poem.

30:48.012 --> 30:52.148
"Art hid with art, so
well perform'd the cheat,"

30:52.150 --> 30:54.950
"caught the carver
with his own deceit."

30:54.952 --> 30:58.389
"He knows 'tis madness,
he must adore,"

30:59.190 --> 31:04.028
"and still the more he
knows it, loves the more."

31:04.962 --> 31:06.395
"The flesh,"

31:06.397 --> 31:08.998
"or what so seems,"

31:09.000 --> 31:10.568
"he touches oft,"

31:12.304 --> 31:14.536
"which feels so smooth"

31:14.538 --> 31:16.575
"that he believes it soft."

31:18.710 --> 31:23.315
"Fired with this thought that
once he's strained the breast"

31:24.182 --> 31:27.620
"and on the lips a
burning kiss impressed."

31:30.154 --> 31:31.554
Ovid, isn't it?

31:31.556 --> 31:32.988
Is it?

31:32.990 --> 31:34.222
How do you know that?

31:34.224 --> 31:37.059
Yeah, Pygmalion and the Statue.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.130
Must've studied it at
school or something.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.335
Not just a pretty
face, you know.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.203
The thing is,
that's not the piece

31:48.205 --> 31:49.738
she was supposed to write.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.306
According to the report,

31:51.308 --> 31:54.209
it's a poem by
Friedrich Schiller.

31:54.211 --> 31:56.379
Maybe she knows a few.

31:56.381 --> 31:57.449
It's not unheard of.

31:58.215 --> 32:01.249
Jaquet-Droz's automaton
could be programmed

32:01.251 --> 32:03.987
to write any piece
up to 40 characters.

32:03.989 --> 32:07.090
There you go, what's next?

32:07.092 --> 32:08.591
Next,

32:08.593 --> 32:09.592
she speaks.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.529
I wonder what she'll say.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.763
If she does speak,

32:13.765 --> 32:16.032
it'll have to be pretty crude.

32:16.034 --> 32:19.701
You
mean like, fuck me, Brendan.

32:19.703 --> 32:20.569
Rose.

32:20.571 --> 32:21.437
What?

32:21.439 --> 32:22.441
That's crude.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.511
You know that's
not what I meant.

32:27.511 --> 32:28.510
Do I?

32:31.615 --> 32:33.218
Goodnight, Rose.

32:34.685 --> 32:36.285
Night.

32:38.789 --> 32:40.725
Rose.

32:44.628 --> 32:45.630
Rose.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.033
Rose.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.750
What's wrong, my prince?

34:14.318 --> 34:15.353
Brendan.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.222
Sorry,

34:17.856 --> 34:19.621
I'm scared.

34:19.623 --> 34:20.489
Hm?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.657
Think I heard something.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.659
What did you hear?

34:23.661 --> 34:25.396
A scream, I think.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.534
Think that's what I heard.

34:29.666 --> 34:31.202
But no, don't go.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.773
Let me stay here?

34:37.708 --> 34:39.177
With you, can I?

35:09.907 --> 35:11.110
My prince.

35:30.327 --> 35:31.760
Dear Alexander,

35:31.762 --> 35:33.929
I trust that by now you
have received word

35:33.931 --> 35:37.300
from King Frederick
regarding your commission.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.767
It is of great importance

35:38.769 --> 35:41.836
that our communications
remain secret.

35:41.838 --> 35:43.838
So fundamental is
this stipulation

35:43.840 --> 35:47.309
that I must insist you
carry out all work

35:47.311 --> 35:49.612
at my home here in Prussia.

35:49.614 --> 35:53.648
This work is, as you can
imagine, deeply personal to me.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.918
Although you are to be
the engineer of the piece,

35:55.920 --> 35:58.320
it is I who will guide
your skilled hand

35:58.322 --> 36:01.590
at all times towards perfection.

36:01.592 --> 36:04.626
My specifications are
exact and my standards high

36:04.628 --> 36:08.366
as they have always been in
matters regarding my dear,

36:09.934 --> 36:12.534
sweet Talia.

36:12.536 --> 36:16.905
I thank you in advance for
bestowing upon my princess a kind

36:16.907 --> 36:20.742
of immortality of
immutable virtue

36:20.744 --> 36:22.778
that so soothes

36:22.780 --> 36:25.384
a doting father's heart.

36:26.516 --> 36:27.583
My Dear General,

36:27.585 --> 36:31.253
rest assure that we will
recreate her vital essence

36:31.255 --> 36:35.391
employing the finest methods
and materials known to man.

36:35.393 --> 36:38.461
Together, we will astound
the peoples of the world

36:38.463 --> 36:41.697
with the wonder of our creation.

36:41.699 --> 36:45.467
I am in love already
with the very idea

36:45.469 --> 36:47.603
of our Immortal Princess

36:47.605 --> 36:52.610
and I dare say we shall
find ourselves entranced

36:52.811 --> 36:56.481
as she comes to life through us.

37:21.806 --> 37:24.409
Sorry, I thought you
might have heard me coming.

37:25.976 --> 37:26.978
Well, I didn't.

37:28.012 --> 37:28.811
And what were you drawing

37:28.813 --> 37:31.746
before I snuck up
you so cruelly?

37:31.748 --> 37:32.750
Nothing.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.651
I thought we were past this.

37:36.653 --> 37:38.753
I said nothing.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.264
What are you looking at?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.632
Stay here, I'll be
back in a minute.

37:49.634 --> 37:50.333
What is it?

37:50.335 --> 37:51.900
Just stay put, okay?

39:04.909 --> 39:05.840
What's wrong?

39:05.842 --> 39:06.541
What do you mean?

39:06.543 --> 39:08.043
I heard you scream.

39:08.045 --> 39:08.911
It was nothing.

39:08.913 --> 39:09.914
Are you sure?

39:11.047 --> 39:12.049
What's for lunch?

39:27.864 --> 39:30.032
So, have you solved it yet?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.967
Solved what exactly?

39:31.969 --> 39:33.802
The great riddle
of the amazing doll

39:33.804 --> 39:36.972
that should have never
existed.

39:36.974 --> 39:37.976
Yes.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.376
Yes what?

39:41.378 --> 39:44.746
The lines the doll wrote,
they came from separate poems.

39:44.748 --> 39:46.916
That's why I couldn't
place them at first.

39:46.918 --> 39:47.919
A mashup.

39:51.588 --> 39:53.121
No,

39:53.123 --> 39:54.125
no, it can't be.

39:56.092 --> 39:59.096
Both the poems were written
long after the doll was created.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.867
You think that
proves it's a fraud?

40:04.869 --> 40:07.470
Suppose that poets could
have borrowed the lines

40:07.472 --> 40:08.607
from earlier books.

40:12.242 --> 40:14.813
You're starting to
fall for her, aren't you?

40:16.547 --> 40:18.947
Still so much that
doesn't add up.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.886
So far I've seen effects
but no workings.

40:23.621 --> 40:27.559
Whatever machinery drives
her is very well hidden.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.863
Surely it's actions and
not motivations that count.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.231
I'm still skeptical,

40:35.233 --> 40:37.501
but I have to be
fair and thorough.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.904
Fair and thorough.

40:40.972 --> 40:41.973
Good man.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.844
Then you'll do the washing up.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.894
Now, Your Highness,

41:05.896 --> 41:08.863
I have a particular
demonstration in mind,

41:08.865 --> 41:09.934
especially for you.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.118
Why would you tremble?

42:17.735 --> 42:19.300
Just more hearsay?

43:16.059 --> 43:17.892
It's fine,

43:17.894 --> 43:19.260
just a stupid accident.

43:19.262 --> 43:20.864
You're bleeding.

43:23.934 --> 43:24.936
Calm down.

43:26.836 --> 43:27.838
It's not so bad.

43:29.072 --> 43:30.805
Needs cleaning though.

43:38.882 --> 43:41.182
That's what you get
for playing with dolls.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.996
I'm, I'm just gonna go do
some more reading, I think.

43:53.998 --> 43:54.829
Can I help?

43:54.831 --> 43:56.731
No, get some rest.

43:56.733 --> 43:58.670
Sorry, I just, I
need to concentrate.

44:36.172 --> 44:37.338
No.

44:46.916 --> 44:49.086
Daddy loves you, Princess.

44:50.086 --> 44:51.722
Daddy loves you.

44:53.456 --> 44:55.125
Thank you, Daddy.

45:12.242 --> 45:14.943
Do you love me?

45:14.945 --> 45:16.878
Do you love me?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.880
Do you love me?

45:18.882 --> 45:20.085
Do you love me?

45:21.351 --> 45:22.753
Do you love me?

45:25.121 --> 45:26.121
Do you love

45:26.123 --> 45:28.222
me?

46:17.974 --> 46:19.243
I know,

46:21.045 --> 46:22.247
Really want to.

46:26.182 --> 46:28.516
No, no, no.

46:28.518 --> 46:29.987
You're so beautiful,

46:31.521 --> 46:33.021
I just thought I'd...

46:33.023 --> 46:35.023
Is everything all right?

46:39.463 --> 46:40.465
Fine.

46:41.398 --> 46:42.463
Were you talking...

46:42.465 --> 46:46.534
To myself, and you can
hardly blame me for that.

46:46.536 --> 46:50.104
You know, if anything's
the matter, you can tell me.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.027
There's just no way.

47:20.570 --> 47:24.241
You could hardly have
stood up on your own.

47:25.943 --> 47:29.414
And you would hardly
have done it yourself.

47:31.081 --> 47:32.083
So.

47:46.230 --> 47:50.034
The Princess wishes to
perform a dance for you,

47:51.168 --> 47:52.170
if you would allow it.

48:10.621 --> 48:12.891
It's just not possible.

48:17.695 --> 48:18.963
She must be a fake.

48:21.331 --> 48:22.530
You insult me, sir.

49:02.306 --> 49:04.474
What are you waiting for?

49:07.710 --> 49:10.247
Dance, I haven't got all day!

49:20.490 --> 49:21.559
I'm so sorry.

51:05.195 --> 51:06.197
My prince.

51:16.806 --> 51:18.208
What are you?

51:25.882 --> 51:30.087
Rose?

52:56.606 --> 52:58.340
Afternoon.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.342
I've been looking for you.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.409
Well, you found me.

53:02.411 --> 53:05.380
Rose, we have to talk
about a few things.

53:05.382 --> 53:06.213
We do?

53:06.215 --> 53:08.351
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.753
All these plants
are dead.

53:12.755 --> 53:13.757
Rose,

53:16.360 --> 53:18.392
the dance, the one you
did in the garden,

53:18.394 --> 53:19.293
where did you learn it?

53:19.295 --> 53:20.461
I made it up.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.499
We both know that's not true.

53:25.501 --> 53:27.302
Calling me a liar?

53:27.304 --> 53:28.637
The doll did her dance today

53:28.639 --> 53:30.871
and it was exactly
the same as yours.

53:30.873 --> 53:32.740
I mean, exactly.

53:32.742 --> 53:34.909
You've been messing
with her, haven't you?

53:34.911 --> 53:38.545
Don't you know what they say
about people in glass houses?

53:38.547 --> 53:41.615
This is serious, Rose.

53:41.617 --> 53:44.351
I need you to answer me,

53:44.353 --> 53:46.720
have you been messing
with the doll?

53:46.722 --> 53:48.055
You've obviously
already made up your mind.

53:48.057 --> 53:50.525
I haven't done anything.

53:50.527 --> 53:52.626
The other poem,

53:52.628 --> 53:54.699
you wrote it, didn't you?

53:55.831 --> 53:57.599
What is this?

53:57.601 --> 53:58.967
What is this?

53:58.969 --> 54:00.434
Are you trying to,
trying to trick me?

54:00.436 --> 54:02.604
Trying to mess me up?

54:02.606 --> 54:04.706
You looked at my sketchpad.

54:04.708 --> 54:06.608
My private drawings!

54:06.610 --> 54:07.909
I don't know who
you are anymore.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.010
What's gotten into you?

54:09.012 --> 54:10.014
You're not yourself.

54:11.047 --> 54:13.514
And you're exactly yourself.

54:13.516 --> 54:15.418
Same old same old.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.686
Grow up, Brendan.

54:17.688 --> 54:21.726
I have.

54:22.626 --> 54:23.628
Admit it.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.026
You want me.

54:30.599 --> 54:35.538
Thank you, Daddy.

54:37.673 --> 54:39.641
I'm so sorry.

54:39.643 --> 54:40.644
Don't be.

54:41.577 --> 54:42.780
It was perfect.

54:48.851 --> 54:49.853
Let go.

54:50.619 --> 54:52.355
Don't you love me?

54:53.356 --> 54:54.555
Don't go, please!

55:13.744 --> 55:14.876
We're leaving.

55:14.878 --> 55:15.677
No, we're not.

55:15.679 --> 55:17.512
- Rose...
- Please, just listen.

55:20.851 --> 55:22.952
I'm so sorry about how
I've been lately.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.854
It's all right.

55:25.856 --> 55:26.891
It's not all right.

55:27.858 --> 55:30.825
Don't know what came over
me the past few days,

55:30.827 --> 55:32.897
but I feel better now.

55:34.630 --> 55:35.632
I swear.

55:37.032 --> 55:39.566
And it would kill me to
think we left because of me.

55:39.568 --> 55:41.702
It's not because of you.

55:41.704 --> 55:42.806
It's this place.

55:43.907 --> 55:46.010
It's no good for
us, either of us.

55:47.577 --> 55:48.976
But you're so close.

55:48.978 --> 55:51.079
Think of what that
money could do for us.

55:51.081 --> 55:53.081
It's only money.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.785
It's only a shitload of money.

55:55.652 --> 55:56.653
Language.

56:00.157 --> 56:01.392
Brendan,

56:03.460 --> 56:05.528
I read about the dance
in some documents.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.365
That's how I know about it.

56:12.135 --> 56:13.137
Please?

56:15.871 --> 56:17.438
Can we stay?

56:17.440 --> 56:18.708
You're so close.

56:26.682 --> 56:27.684
All right.

56:28.418 --> 56:32.119
But if we do stay, you
have to be honest with me.

56:32.121 --> 56:33.655
No more secrets, okay?

56:36.760 --> 56:37.762
Just the...

56:38.894 --> 56:41.030
Final life now, final test.

56:42.032 --> 56:43.067
The last supper.

56:45.001 --> 56:46.170
So ignonymous.

56:47.170 --> 56:48.905
We should make a meal of it.

56:52.509 --> 56:54.876
What have I told you
about using puns?

56:54.878 --> 56:58.079
To make lots of them
because they're hilarious?

56:58.081 --> 57:00.715
Come on, I'll cook.

57:00.717 --> 57:03.150
And we could get
dressed up all fancy.

57:03.152 --> 57:04.519
May as well enjoy our last night

57:04.521 --> 57:05.923
as Lord and Lady of the Manor.

57:07.157 --> 57:08.121
Please?

57:08.123 --> 57:09.958
Let's go out on a high.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.961
Fine.

57:14.231 --> 57:15.630
You're scared of
how close you are

57:15.632 --> 57:17.632
to proving it's
real, aren't you?

57:55.271 --> 58:00.041
Time for you to start
revealing your secrets.

58:20.195 --> 58:23.097
Is that what he built you for?

59:02.706 --> 59:04.875
I am Alexander Maclntosh,

59:05.775 --> 59:07.144
and this is my confession.

59:10.313 --> 59:14.182
The Immortal Princess is
not a mechanical marvel

59:14.184 --> 59:19.189
but abomination for which
I bear full responsibility.

59:20.923 --> 59:22.923
Not long into the
commission it became clear

59:22.925 --> 59:24.958
that what The General
was demanding

59:24.960 --> 59:26.896
was an impossibility.

59:27.630 --> 59:30.733
Such an automaton
could not be built.

59:31.367 --> 59:34.068
Fearing the consequences
of failing The King,

59:34.070 --> 59:36.340
I entered into a devil's pact,

59:37.340 --> 59:40.842
suggested by The
General himself.

59:40.844 --> 59:43.746
The doll could not operate
of its own volition,

59:45.882 --> 59:47.784
an actress hidden inside.

59:49.318 --> 59:51.853
The General embarked
on a crazed plot

59:51.855 --> 59:53.824
to fake his daughter's
disappearance

59:54.523 --> 59:58.695
and force her into performing
as the doll in secret.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:00.998
A dark plan

01:00:02.331 --> 01:00:04.300
that I found myself
accomplice to.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.872
But Talia and I had
a secret also.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.775
We were in love.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.653
But our affair was
soon discovered.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.755
Only then did I learn
just how jealous

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.661
how monstrously deranged.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.193
The General was.

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.331
He took his own daughter

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:37.865
and mutilated her...

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:40.034
- No!
- Body and mind.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.070
No!

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:45.173
In my cowardice, I
acquiesced to his

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.775
depraved plan to imprison...
No, please!

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:48.443
- Please!
- The breath

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:50.177
that she had become.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.845
No!

01:00:51.847 --> 01:00:52.849
Talia!

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.186
No!

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.854
Get away!

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:00.858
Talia!

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:02.860
No!

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:34.892
A hostage made silent
encased within the doll.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.992
But since the night
of the unveiling,

01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:41.162
over the applause and the music,

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.967
I can still hear
her lasting scream

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:48.168
no louder than a whisper,

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.338
unheard by all but me.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:56.209
The General swore to me
he would release her to me

01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.414
after the performance.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.282
Instead,

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.452
he sealed poor Talia
inside the doll

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.155
to preserve within it

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:09.358
her innocence forever.

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.994
Preserve his furious lust.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.505
By then, I knew not
whether she was even alive

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:24.875
until that night.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.377
Forgive me.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.845
Oh, God, forgive me.

01:02:31.847 --> 01:02:32.849
Talia!

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.286
Talia.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.856
The thing that I found

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.825
behind the mask was a devil,

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:46.860
a wild bird who had
come to love her cage.

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:49.496
My God!

01:03:32.507 --> 01:03:35.309
Thing that was once Talia
knocked me unconscious.

01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:38.345
Then took up a torch
from the basement

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:41.349
and ran about the house
setting it alight.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.650
I have awoken to smoke and fire

01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:45.353
and yet she had returned to me

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.487
to prevent my escape.

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:50.391
Here I shall remain with her

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:53.094
as my final breath draws near.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:56.664
I only hope that she will
find peace in the darkness.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.102
I fear that I will not.

01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:15.585
You performed for me.

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.124
How is that possible?

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.515
Inquisitive runt.

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:51.587
Like the curious boy,

01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.192
fumbling for lust.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.963
It takes but the
slightest of secrets

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.967
to unlock an eruption!

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:09.472
You, the little maggot,

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:15.342
in spoiled undergarments,

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.545
sobbing in the dark.

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.553
But you are no longer alone

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:28.157
for I shall take your
devilish attributes

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.427
and make of them

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.230
a real man.

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:37.333
And then,

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.171
we shall share in delight...

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.710
Of a freshly..

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:49.379
Pricked...

01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:53.049
Rose.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.023
You're not real.

01:06:02.157 --> 01:06:03.293
You're just in my head.

01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:17.771
So full, your sweet
Rose, so ripe,

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:20.441
and when the fruit
hangs heavy on the tree,

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.242
it must be plucked!

01:06:24.179 --> 01:06:25.713
Do you not see

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:29.383
that every little girl
desires attention

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.153
craves discipline?

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:35.822
I have much to teach you.

01:06:37.726 --> 01:06:42.463
Rose
bud, rose bud, rose bud red,

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:46.666
there grows it ever,
there blooms it yet.

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:50.804
Rose bud, rose
bud, rose bud red,

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:55.508
there grows it ever,
there blooms it yet.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.014
Rose bud,

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.516
rose bud,

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.719
rose bud red,

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.421
there grows it ever...

01:07:08.423 --> 01:07:10.659
And blooms it yet!

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.411
Since when do you smoke a pipe?

01:07:33.748 --> 01:07:35.384
Suits me, don't you think?

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:39.056
You've been up all night?

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.458
Sleep is for the weak.

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:45.528
Make any revelations?

01:07:47.262 --> 01:07:50.666
All these questions,
questions, questions.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.404
Doesn't your little mind
ever rest, Rose Bud?

01:07:56.371 --> 01:07:59.572
I'm just interested, Jesus.

01:07:59.574 --> 01:08:03.547
I don't like your
tone, young lady.

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.349
Well,

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:08.351
I don't like yours.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.853
Seem to be under the illusion

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.625
that insolence will be
tolerated under my roof!

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:20.261
Well, let me assure
you it will not.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.836
Why are you being like this?

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:30.638
You are just like your mother.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.776
Willful, arrogant, wanton!

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.113
And beautiful.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.915
You think so?

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.118
Oh, yes,

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.453
so very beautiful.

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.656
Thank you,

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.658
Daddy.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.759
Wear the red dress to dinner.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:01.505
All right.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:53.670
I think I need to lie down.

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:58.141
She
yearns for you, Brendan.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:02.643
Take her and you will find me.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:04.147
She dreams of you.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:09.386
I know because her dreams
are mine now, and mine hers.

01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:13.620
We are one in spirit,

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.658
in flesh, our flesh,

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:20.160
so pure, so eager to be touched.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.194
You're awake.

01:14:25.226 --> 01:14:26.895
If you want me to be.

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:29.599
Close your eyes.

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:51.119
Oh, God.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.625
What, what have I done?

01:14:58.627 --> 01:14:59.893
What's wrong?

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.061
I'm sorry.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.862
You don't want me!

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.834
No!

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:15.979
I'm so sorry.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:17.847
No!

01:15:52.914 --> 01:15:53.917
No!

01:15:56.618 --> 01:16:01.256
No, no, no Rose, no!

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.156
Don't!

01:16:18.806 --> 01:16:20.275
I don't understand.

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:22.946
Where's Rose?

01:16:24.145 --> 01:16:25.981
Everything is all right now.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:54.775
Do it.

01:17:19.967 --> 01:17:21.304
Thank you, Daddy.

01:18:49.123 --> 01:18:50.126
Whore!

01:18:58.966 --> 01:18:59.935
No, no!

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:05.504
She's a wild one

01:19:05.506 --> 01:19:08.510
but I know just how
to break her in.

01:19:12.079 --> 01:19:13.513
Brendan!

01:20:45.172 --> 01:20:46.175
Rose!

01:20:49.677 --> 01:20:50.880
Rose!

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:52.615
Rose!

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.087
Rose!

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.021
Rose!

01:21:01.088 --> 01:21:02.589
Rose!

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:06.459
Oh, little man, in
your little boots,

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:09.595
which bed will you
hide under now?

01:21:09.597 --> 01:21:12.601
Or shall I find you hidden
under your mother's skirt?

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:18.271
But wherever you are,
I shall sniff you out,

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.042
my pretty little quim.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.345
Fly, cherub, fly!

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.678
As fast as you can!

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.115
Or it's the hounds of
hell that you chase

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:32.117
and their flame is
hot, as hot as fire!

01:21:32.119 --> 01:21:33.119
Rose!

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:36.121
Oh, you
shan't escape my hounds!

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:48.170
Faster, cherub, faster, faster!

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:54.040
You shan't escape my hounds!

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:35.151
No.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:04.677
No!

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:15.187
Boo, peekaboo!

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:17.057
Oh, there, there.

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:20.259
I know, I know, your
suffering has been great.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.294
And I know that because
we have tortured you

01:23:22.296 --> 01:23:24.531
so magnificently.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:25.799
But alas, while The General,

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:28.735
he may well be content
with your body,

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:32.504
The Princess, she wants
something more special.

01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:34.242
Wait, oh, God, no!

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.277
God?

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:40.016
Oh, he doesn't come
round here very often.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:44.317
She's upset because you
tried to run away.

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:46.753
Well, if she can't have you,

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.656
maybe she will have your
little whore instead.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.590
No!

01:23:51.592 --> 01:23:56.428
No!

01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:57.766
Ah, here they come,

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:01.701
the sweet angels of death,

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:05.604
sent to take you back
to her sweet embrace.

01:24:05.606 --> 01:24:07.409
No, please, no, no!

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:09.311
No!

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:11.647
No!

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:15.682
No!

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.804
Stop it, no, no!

01:24:38.806 --> 01:24:40.443
No, you can't, no!

01:25:04.431 --> 01:25:05.932
I won't run.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.604
Please, please, no, let her go.

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:10.573
Let her go!

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:16.411
Let her go, I'll do whatever
you want, just let her go.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:20.213
What happened to you, it
was wrong and I'm sorry.

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:23.485
But you could stop it,
you could stop it now.

01:25:30.192 --> 01:25:33.826
Shh, shh, shut up, shut up!

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:41.704
Please, Talia,

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:46.341
please, I'll be yours, forever.

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:53.681
I swear.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.919
Forever.

01:26:28.984 --> 01:26:30.186
Rose.

01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:39.521
Go outside and wait in the car.

01:27:41.488 --> 01:27:43.022
Go on.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.426
It's all right.

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:47.695
Okay.

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:49.861
Don't be long.

01:28:38.512 --> 01:28:39.614
Rose, Rose!

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:52.023
No, no, no!

01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:17.853
Brendan!

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:27.796
You have to get
out of here, now.

01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:36.936
And never come back.

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:37.940
What?

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.705
No!

01:29:40.707 --> 01:29:41.777
Brendan, run!

01:29:42.743 --> 01:29:43.608
Brendan, run!

01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:45.644
I have to stay here, Rose.

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:49.451
But you can go, now.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.422
Be happy, Rose.
