00:09.968 --> 00:12.130
<i>I've always loved trains.</i>

00:14.056 --> 00:16.013
<i>In fact, if my career</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:19.468
<i>in theoretical physics hadn't
worked out, my backup plan</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:22.099
<i>was to become
a professional ticket taker.</i>

00:22.314 --> 00:23.430
<i>Or hobo.</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:33.482
<i>And when I figured out
that trains allowed me</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:35.612
<i>to prove Newton's first law...</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:37.944
<i>an object in motion stays
in motion</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:40.450
<i>with the same speed
and in the same direction</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:43.283
<i>unless acted upon
by an unbalanced force...</i>

00:43.502 --> 00:46.586
<i>I felt like Neil Armstrong
on the moon,</i>

00:46.797 --> 00:48.538
<i>alone and happy.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:50.248
<i>Shelly, dinner's ready!</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:55.302
<i>I don't care
how dimwitted you are.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:58.678
<i>Scientific principles
have to make you smile.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:01.100
<i>Of course,
nobody I knew in East Texas</i>

01:01.311 --> 01:04.804
<i>in 1989 cared
about Newtonian physics.</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:07.060
<i>The only Newtons
they cared about</i>

01:07.276 --> 01:08.892
<i>were Wayne and Fig.</i>

01:09.111 --> 01:10.318
<i>Sheldon, if
you don't get in here,</i>

01:10.529 --> 01:13.021
<i>- I'm gonna lick your toothbrush!</i>
- Coming!

01:13.282 --> 01:14.398
<i>That's my sister.</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:16.323
<i>And she's done it before.</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:21.821
The hell
were you doing

01:22.040 --> 01:22.951
- out there?
<i>- George,</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:23.826
language.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.453
What language? So?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.626
I was exploring
dimensional kinematics.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.371
Admit it...
he's adopted.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.706
<i>How can I be adopted</i>

01:30.924 --> 01:32.381
when I have a twin sister?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.050
Think, monkey, think.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.001
<i>That's enough.</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:35.880
No one's adopted.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.007
I wish I was.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.804
That can still be arranged.

01:39.016 --> 01:39.756
Now, let's pray.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.591
A moment, please.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.804
- Leave him be.
- He can hold hands

01:46.023 --> 01:47.230
with his family.
It won't kill him.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.557
We don't know that.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.017
Georgie, did you wash
your hands before dinner?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.352
Or even this week?

01:52.571 --> 01:53.732
None of your business.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.108
Hence the mittens.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.525
<i>Thank you, God,
for this food</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:00.906
we're about to receive and for
the nourishment of our bodies,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.828
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.079
Amen.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.958
How come we ain't got
no tater tots?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.251
I made tater tots last night.

02:10.088 --> 02:10.874
I'd take
tater tots

02:11.089 --> 02:12.455
over mashed potaters any day.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.461
- Just eat what I made you.
<i>- Can we at least</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:15.587
have tater tots
tomorrow?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.634
<i>It was family dinners like this</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:20.759
<i>that led me to adopt
a mid-Atlantic accent.</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:22.385
<i>Nobel Prize winners...</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:24.263
<i>ought not be orderin' tater tots.</i>

02:24.478 --> 02:26.561
Everybody excited
to start school Monday?

02:26.772 --> 02:27.387
I am.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.562
I guess so.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.557
<i>Georgie?</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:32.062
Freshman year,
that's a big deal.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.688
How can I be excited
when he's gonna be

02:33.904 --> 02:35.111
in the same grade as me?

02:35.572 --> 02:36.858
Don't worry,
Georgie, I'm not planning

02:37.074 --> 02:39.111
on being in the ninth
grade for very long.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.534
All I know is he's not in
the same grade as me anymore,

02:41.745 --> 02:42.610
and I'm thrilled.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.620
Good luck
with your finger painting.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.614
You're gonna get your ass kicked
in high school.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.074
<i>Hey, language.</i>

02:48.377 --> 02:49.663
I'm not going to be assaulted.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.710
High school is a haven
for higher learning.

02:51.922 --> 02:52.878
Oh, dear God.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.834
Speaking of God,
who's going to church

02:55.050 --> 02:56.416
- with me tomorrow?
<i>- I can't.</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:58.296
I'm meeting
with the other coaches.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.593
You can't meet after church?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.671
No, Mary,
I can't meet after church.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.135
Georgie?

03:04.476 --> 03:05.842
I got to study
my playbook.

03:09.940 --> 03:10.976
I'll go with you, Mom.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.432
<i>Why are you going?</i>

03:12.651 --> 03:14.267
- You don't believe in God.
<i>- No,</i>

03:14.486 --> 03:15.772
but I believe in Mom.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.523
I'll take it. Missy?

03:17.739 --> 03:18.695
Can't, Heather
asked me to...

03:18.907 --> 03:20.648
- You're goin'.
- Son of a bitch.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.658
- Hey.
<i>- Ow!</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:26.287
<i>Missy...
Don't you</i>

03:26.498 --> 03:28.911
throw something at the
dinner table. George Jr.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.210
<i>Jane Goodall had
to go to Africa to study apes.</i>

03:32.504 --> 03:33.119
<i>Hey!</i>

03:33.422 --> 03:35.288
<i>I just had to go to dinner.</i>

03:36.133 --> 03:37.544
Never at the
dinner table!

03:37.759 --> 03:39.170
You knock that
off, George!

03:39.386 --> 03:41.218
D-Do not retaliate!

04:00.949 --> 04:04.113
In Matthew nine, verse four,
Jesus said,

04:04.453 --> 04:08.413
<i>"Why would you entertain
evil thoughts in your hearts?"</i>

04:09.040 --> 04:10.952
- Do you have evil thoughts?
- Shh.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.955
I just don't think
this part applies to me.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.127
That's fine.
Be quiet and listen.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.212
I'm only nine years old.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.255
Most evil doesn't start
till puberty.

04:21.219 --> 04:21.925
Hello.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.719
<i>Philippians 4:8,</i>

04:24.389 --> 04:26.255
<i>"Finally, brothers,
whatever is..."</i>

04:26.475 --> 04:27.886
Do you have
evil thoughts?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.012
I'm having one
right now.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.472
Really? What is it?

04:30.687 --> 04:33.304
When we get home, I'm gonna
kick your little balls.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.606
You can't.
They haven't descended yet.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.025
- Mom?
- What?

04:39.237 --> 04:41.320
When should I be expecting
my testicles?

04:41.531 --> 04:42.692
<i>"...whatever
is admirable..."</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:44.740
What is wrong with him?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.817
Nothin' is wrong with him.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.324
Now, turn around before
I knock your lights out.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.031
<i>...think continually
on these things.</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:53.286
<i>A good thought
leads</i>

04:53.502 --> 04:54.834
<i>to a good thing.</i>

04:55.045 --> 04:56.786
<i>You feel it in your body.
You feel it in your...</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:59.292
<i>My mom was
my Christian soldier.</i>

04:59.508 --> 05:01.716
<i>...leads to evil things
and sits there and...</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:05.011
<i>And for the record,
they descended when I was 15.</i>

05:15.816 --> 05:18.479
Shelly, it's your last day
of summer. Go out and enjoy it.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.776
But I have to learn
the student handbook.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.853
<i>Ooh, did you know
extreme hairstyles,</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:25.486
goatees and mustaches
are not allowed?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.158
- I didn't.
- I personally find that very reassuring.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.783
Look what a beautiful day it is.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.879
Go play.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.678
"Go play"... if only
life were that simple.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.099
There, I played.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.437
Hey, Sheldon!

05:58.066 --> 05:59.477
Hello, Billy Sparks.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.685
- Hello, Matilda Sparks.
<i>- I heard</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:04.270
- you're going to high school tomorrow.<i>
- I am.</i>

06:04.489 --> 06:06.105
You're going to have
to find someone else

06:06.324 --> 06:07.815
to torment on the playground.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.863
"Torment"?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.115
It means to maliciously harass.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.662
"Her ass"?

06:14.082 --> 06:14.993
That's funny.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.870
Well, this was nice.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.075
Hey, doofus!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.291
Mom!

06:21.756 --> 06:23.543
- Good girl.
<i>- Mom!</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:27.377
<i>What am I supposed to do?
His feet are growing.</i>

06:27.596 --> 06:29.178
<i>Why can't
he wear Georgie's old shoes?</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:30.505
<i>He won't
hold your hand.</i>

06:30.724 --> 06:31.680
<i>You think he's gonna
put his feet</i>

06:31.892 --> 06:32.973
<i>in his brother's smelly shoes?</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:34.766
<i>Well, we damn well
better cut back somewhere.</i>

06:34.978 --> 06:36.640
<i>Will you please keep
your voice down?</i>

06:38.106 --> 06:39.768
They're fighting
about you again.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.770
They're fighting about money.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.102
It's a common argument
in marriages.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.110
Lights out.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.532
Big day tomorrow.

06:51.244 --> 06:51.859
Mom?

06:52.078 --> 06:52.989
Hmm?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.321
Do we have financial problems?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.077
Don't you worry about that.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.283
We are fine.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.126
Now, go to sleep.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.253
She's lying. She just said that
to make you feel better.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.585
Mom doesn't lie.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.211
<i>Sure, she thinks</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:11.796
the Earth was made in six days,

07:12.015 --> 07:14.598
but that's 'cause
she's gullible, not a liar.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.012
<i>Mom,</i>

07:20.440 --> 07:22.147
Sheldon can't find his bowtie.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.600
Really? I laid it out for him.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.811
Leave it alone, Mary.
He doesn't need a bowtie.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.943
It's his first day of school.
Let him wear what he wants.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.150
<i>Mom,
I can't find my bowtie!</i>

07:32.369 --> 07:34.452
Dear Lord, why's he
got to wear a bowtie?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.329
Can I drive in with you?

07:37.916 --> 07:38.531
Sure.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.582
Everybody's gonna know
he's your brother.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.160
It's gonna be awful for you.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.415
Tell her to shut up.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.204
She's not wrong.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.624
- It's got to be here.
<i>- It's not.</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:51.506
- It's not!
- Shelly, stay calm. We'll find it.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.929
- My tie is gone! My tie is gone!<i>
- Shelly,</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:55.221
you don't really need a tie.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.597
I have to find my tie.
I have to find my tie.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.885
Be right back.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.143
Professor Proton wears a bowtie!

08:03.566 --> 08:04.556
George Junior,

08:05.527 --> 08:07.769
- give me back that bowtie right now!
- I didn't take it!

08:07.988 --> 08:10.696
- Don't you lie to me!
- I'm not lying!

08:11.199 --> 08:14.317
- We'll see about that.
- Stay out of my room!

08:14.536 --> 08:16.323
She's gonna find
your dirty magazines.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.403
Shut up!

08:17.789 --> 08:19.530
You are not having a good day.

08:28.133 --> 08:28.919
Ugh!

08:31.261 --> 08:33.594
Hey. Hey,
he didn't take it.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.511
- Then what happened to it?!
<i>- I can't find my bowtie!</i>

08:35.724 --> 08:37.681
I'll check in
the bathroom!

08:38.268 --> 08:39.258
I took it.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.510
- Why would you do that?
<i>- Mary,</i>

08:41.730 --> 08:43.847
the boy is nine years old
and going into high school.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.560
Isn't that weird enough?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.141
- Give it to me.
<i>- Come on.</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:48.771
It's not just Sheldon.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.356
Georgie's gonna be
in class with him.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.279
Not in the bathroom!

08:52.907 --> 08:54.068
Give it.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.172
Not really. I always lose.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.874
I know. That's why it's fun.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.927
How about license plates
with prime numbers

09:15.138 --> 09:17.130
<i>- followed by a cons...?</i>
- Why don't we just talk?

09:17.348 --> 09:18.213
Very well.

09:20.268 --> 09:20.883
You understand

09:21.102 --> 09:23.219
that some people are gonna be
intimidated by you

09:23.438 --> 09:24.428
'cause of how smart you are?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.852
Or maybe
they'll recognize my intellect

09:27.067 --> 09:28.854
and make me their leader.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.310
Lord, look after my son.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.987
Don't let him get
stuffed in a gym bag.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.494
Oh, dear.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.703
Yeah.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.589
That boy has
an exposed tattoo.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.587
<i>He does.</i>

09:53.802 --> 09:54.462
I wonder if he knows

09:54.677 --> 09:56.760
that's in violation
of the dress code.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.390
Speaking of which, how
about we lose the bowtie?

10:01.935 --> 10:02.971
Why?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.727
Look around, honey. None of the
other kids are wearing one.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.475
Well, perhaps I'll start a fad.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.807
No, you won't.
Please trust Mommy.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.392
All right,
tell you what.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.070
You take it off,
and this weekend,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.318
I'll take you to RadioShack.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.029
Hmm?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.454
You doing okay?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.494
I guess.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.251
I smell ammonia.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.921
They must've done
a thorough cleaning recently.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.508
I like that.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.046
<i>And remember, if anybody
bothers you, what do you say?</i>

10:41.266 --> 10:42.882
My dad's a football coach.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.218
- And?
- My brother's a football player.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.347
Good.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.803
Hey, Mom, look.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.513
That girl's pregnant.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.686
Congratulations.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.947
Well, that was revolting.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.950
All right.
This is your homeroom.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.653
Do you want me
to go in with you?

11:03.872 --> 11:06.580
No. Although I could've used you
in the restroom.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.373
Okay, well...

11:09.294 --> 11:10.250
You have a good day.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.451
And I'll pick you up
after school,

11:11.671 --> 11:13.287
same door we came in.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.877
Are you crying or having
an allergy attack?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.129
Allergies.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.710
It's probably the ammonia.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.636
Probably.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.677
Okay. Let the learning begin.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.229
All right, everybody,
my name is Ms. MacElroy.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.689
In addition to being
your homeroom teacher,

11:40.909 --> 11:43.401
<i>I'll be seeing some of you
in my English class,</i>

11:43.620 --> 11:45.612
<i>and some of you
on the volleyball court.</i>

11:45.830 --> 11:47.037
<i>Just to give you
a little history,</i>

11:47.498 --> 11:49.615
<i>I've been here at Medford
for 29 years...</i>

11:50.752 --> 11:51.959
<i>...I taught some of your
older brothers and sisters,</i>

11:52.170 --> 11:54.583
<i>and sadly,
some of your parents.</i>

11:56.591 --> 11:57.672
Not much I haven't seen.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.216
<i>Until today.</i>

11:59.719 --> 12:02.712
I'm sure you're well aware
we have a student with us,

12:03.014 --> 12:04.971
who, despite his young age,

12:05.266 --> 12:07.053
<i>is remarkably gifted.</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:10.511
And I expect y'all
to make him feel welcome.

12:11.940 --> 12:12.771
Yes, Sheldon?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.357
Per the student dress
and grooming code,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.359
this boy's hair is too long,

12:17.570 --> 12:18.936
this boy is wearing
sports attire

12:19.155 --> 12:21.317
outside
of a designated area

12:21.532 --> 12:23.524
and this girl's blouse
is diaphanous,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.609
which means
I can see her brassiere.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.195
Thank you.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.034
<i>I will take that
into account.</i>

12:30.792 --> 12:31.452
<i>All right.</i>

12:31.668 --> 12:33.660
We have a few minutes
before first period.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.086
I need y'all
to fill out these forms.

12:36.297 --> 12:36.957
What?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.289
Also in violation

12:38.508 --> 12:39.919
of the grooming code
on page 48,

12:40.134 --> 12:42.171
article five, subsection B,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.219
you have a bit of a mustache.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.050
This is a stupid idea.
This boy does not

12:49.269 --> 12:50.180
belong in our school.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.977
<i>Come on Vicky,
it's just the first day.</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:53.895
Why don't we all just take
a deep breath here?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.599
The hell with that. Five
minutes into my math class,

12:56.818 --> 12:58.059
he questioned my credentials.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.019
How am I supposed to control a
classroom when a kid accuses me

13:00.238 --> 13:01.729
of being in breach
of the hygiene code?

13:01.948 --> 13:03.405
Well, Hubert, it wouldn't
kill you to shower

13:03.616 --> 13:06.029
<i>a little more often. George,
you want to weigh in here?</i>

13:06.244 --> 13:08.361
- Well...
- Oral Roberts University

13:08.579 --> 13:09.365
is a wonderful school.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.196
He said I was intimidated
by his intelligence,

13:11.416 --> 13:12.031
<i>and then,</i>

13:12.750 --> 13:14.867
he offered to be my "leader."

14:00.715 --> 14:02.001
Do you know
this sonata?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.089
No.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.175
How long have you
played the piano?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.928
I don't play piano.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.381
<i>George,</i>

14:10.683 --> 14:11.673
you got any thoughts here?

14:12.352 --> 14:12.967
I certainly do.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.307
Mary, tell him.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.185
It's simple.
We don't have a choice.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.936
Well, you gave it a shot.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.651
We wish you luck
with Sheldon elsewhere...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.774
No, no, no.

14:24.989 --> 14:25.900
We don't have a choice.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.026
He's got to stay here.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.232
<i>We can't afford</i>

14:28.451 --> 14:29.066
<i>private school.</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:30.446
<i>I sure can't
homeschool him.</i>

14:30.661 --> 14:32.869
He's doing calculus and
Euclidean something or other.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.288
Euclidean geometry.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.865
Guess where I learned that.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.416
Yeah, yeah, we know.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.080
<i>All I care about
is that</i>

14:40.296 --> 14:42.913
my son gets the education
he deserves, so you all

14:43.132 --> 14:44.122
<i>are gonna have to
figure this out.</i>

14:44.342 --> 14:46.208
Coach, can you help me out here,
please?

14:46.427 --> 14:47.292
'Cause I'm dyin'.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.760
I'd rather not.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.554
G minor.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.435
F.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.566
E flat.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.728
C minor.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.403
You have perfect pitch.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.526
Okay.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.364
Sweetheart, you should
really pursue music.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.158
No, thank you.
Musicians take drugs.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.828
Is there a faculty
restroom I could use?

15:37.687 --> 15:38.848
Cooper, Stinson, you're up.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.147
Hey, look,
it's the dumb brother.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.818
Okay.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.075
<i>That's enough. Hey.</i>

15:56.456 --> 15:57.446
<i>Hey, that's enough!</i>

15:57.665 --> 15:58.655
<i>- Hey, hey!</i>
- That's enough!

15:58.875 --> 15:59.535
Georgie.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.583
Georgie! Georgie!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.251
Stop! Stop!

16:06.174 --> 16:07.415
What the hell
is wrong with you?

16:12.013 --> 16:12.924
You okay?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.138
No, I'm not okay.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.357
Where you think you're going?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.355
I quit. I don't want
to play anymore!

16:27.570 --> 16:29.732
- Since when?
- Since right now!

16:30.907 --> 16:32.023
All right, what is going on?

16:32.241 --> 16:34.198
What do you think's going on?!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.576
You mean Sheldon?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.781
You can't let that bother you.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.116
It doesn't bother you?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.826
You got called
to the principal's office.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.377
Yeah, that wasn't so great.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.955
I can't be in the same school
as him!

16:48.174 --> 16:49.585
Well, I don't see
what choice you have.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.544
Right. Ever since he could talk,
I quit having any choices.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.310
I know it's hard.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.435
I'm telling you, as your coach,
quit your whining,

17:06.651 --> 17:08.563
get your uniform on and you
get your ass back out there.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.561
But what about as my dad?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.364
Your dad is
having a bad day.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.156
Listen to your coach.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.080
<i>Can a clock be powered
by an ordinary potato?</i>

17:26.628 --> 17:28.119
<i>I hope so, boys and girls,</i>

17:28.339 --> 17:31.832
<i>or this is going to be
a really boring episode.</i>

17:32.301 --> 17:33.382
<i>The supplies you'll need...</i>

17:33.594 --> 17:35.301
Why can't we
watch <i>DuckTales?</i>

17:35.513 --> 17:38.551
'Cause we don't learn anything
watching <i>DuckTales.</i>

17:38.933 --> 17:41.676
It's TV; we aren't
supposed to learn.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.807
<i>...two alligator grips
and, let's see...</i>

17:45.273 --> 17:47.105
<i>Of course, a clock.</i>

17:47.316 --> 17:49.478
Missy, go somewhere else.
I need to talk to your brother.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.269
Why don't you go somewhere else
and I can watch <i>Duck...</i>

17:52.488 --> 17:53.274
Go!

17:54.198 --> 17:55.359
I hate everybody.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.317
<i>It's time for science.</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:04.323
Hey, he was about to power
a clock with a potato.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.282
Not possible.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.367
- Now, listen...
- Am I in trouble?

18:07.920 --> 18:08.660
No.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.254
Maybe. Just listen.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.250
You're not gonna
make it in this school

18:15.469 --> 18:16.960
if you keep ratting
people out.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.670
But they were breaking
the grooming codes

18:18.889 --> 18:20.096
and the dress codes.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.267
I saw one boy with a T-shirt
that said...

18:23.769 --> 18:24.885
"Bite me."

18:25.104 --> 18:27.312
Yeah. That-that's terrible.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.731
<i>Sheldon, let me tell
you a little story.</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:32.229
Did you ever wonder why we moved
from Galveston to Medford?

18:32.695 --> 18:35.779
No. I tend to wonder
about the bigger questions.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.777
Okay, well, here's why.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.864
Your dad had a real good
coaching job

18:41.370 --> 18:43.407
and I saw some grown-ups
breaking rules.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.495
What'd they do?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.369
I-It's kind of complicated,
but...

18:47.251 --> 18:48.913
football coaches aren't allowed
to recruit kids

18:49.128 --> 18:51.211
from other high schools
to play on their teams.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.538
And you told on them?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.749
Yeah. You know what happened?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.584
Justice descended
upon the rule breakers?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.466
I got fired, Sheldon.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.972
<i>And I got a bad
reputation.</i>

19:03.476 --> 19:06.810
Oh. That's why you
drink so much beer.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.398
Just do yourself a favor.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.475
<i>Okay? Go to
school tomorrow,</i>

19:13.736 --> 19:15.898
and mind your own business.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.692
All right?

19:19.617 --> 19:20.323
Dad.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.281
Are you sad that you got fired?

19:27.249 --> 19:28.456
Mostly angry.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.831
But yeah.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.213
Maybe a little sad.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.676
All right, let's say grace.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.728
Thank you, God,

19:50.940 --> 19:53.227
<i>for this food we are
about to receive.</i>

20:02.284 --> 20:03.274
<i>That was the first time</i>

20:03.494 --> 20:05.360
<i>I held my father's hand.</i>

20:05.788 --> 20:08.451
<i>...our bodies and bless
the hands that prepared it.</i>

20:09.083 --> 20:10.073
Amen.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.453
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

20:14.255 --> 20:17.419
<i>Hey, George Jr.,
wait your turn.</i>

20:17.633 --> 20:19.295
<i>I wouldn't
touch my brother's hand</i>

20:19.510 --> 20:21.172
<i>until 17 years later,</i>

20:21.429 --> 20:23.796
<i>thanks to the invention
of Purell.</i>

20:38.612 --> 20:40.023
You know what I find comforting?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.195
What's that, baby?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.440
In a world filled
with uncertainty,

20:43.659 --> 20:45.275
this place will be here forever.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.575
<i>Hey, Sheldon,
how you doing?</i>
