WEBVTT

00:01.076 --> 00:02.546
Thank you for coming to
this job interview,

00:02.570 --> 00:05.914
Dr. "La-hior-i."

00:05.939 --> 00:07.841
- Lahiri.
- You sure about that?

00:07.866 --> 00:09.100
Just ask me the goddamn questions.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.392
Yeah.

00:10.417 --> 00:12.624
Why should you be the next
head of obstetrics

00:12.649 --> 00:13.839
at Saint Brendan's?

00:13.864 --> 00:16.376
Well, I'm extremely
passionate about the department,

00:16.402 --> 00:19.447
and I am the owner of a very
successful fertility clinic.

00:19.472 --> 00:22.941
And I was recently made honorary
captain of a booze cruise, so...

00:22.966 --> 00:24.657
Practicing for your interview, I see.

00:24.682 --> 00:26.716
Well, isn't that precious?

00:26.717 --> 00:27.817
I don't really need to practice.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.686
I just look like a leader.

00:29.687 --> 00:31.187
Okay, well, these days
leaders are more likely

00:31.188 --> 00:32.522
to look like me.

00:32.523 --> 00:34.724
Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris,
Gabrielle Union.

00:34.725 --> 00:36.426
Well, Mindy, I just hope
you're not too torn up

00:36.427 --> 00:38.628
when I swoop in and steal
this job out from under you.

00:38.629 --> 00:40.530
Let me remind you we work in gynecology,

00:40.531 --> 00:42.165
and you ain't got no vagina.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.534
True, but what I lack
in vaginal ownership,

00:44.535 --> 00:47.170
I more than make up for
in extracurricular research.

00:47.171 --> 00:49.205
And I've been told I have
a very paintable face,

00:49.206 --> 00:51.808
perfect for boardroom portraits,
so I'm not worried.

00:51.809 --> 00:53.209
I'm sure they'll pick the right fella.

00:53.210 --> 00:54.644
- Mm.
- Hmm.

01:01.419 --> 01:03.486
Hello. Remember me?

01:03.487 --> 01:05.889
I'm Irene. Irene Lee?

01:05.890 --> 01:07.457
Are you nervous?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.593
Oh, I am. I haven't been this scared

01:09.594 --> 01:12.696
since our med school class
did an evening of sketch comedy.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.831
Sweat right through
my Austin Powers costume.

01:14.832 --> 01:16.433
Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

01:16.434 --> 01:18.401
but I don't think it's such a good idea

01:18.402 --> 01:19.636
for us to be chitchatting.

01:19.637 --> 01:21.037
Why not?

01:21.038 --> 01:22.839
We're the only two minority women here,

01:22.840 --> 01:25.342
so I don't want them to think
we're some little Asian clique.

01:25.343 --> 01:26.676
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:26.677 --> 01:28.511
- I'm sorry.
- No, but it's not me.

01:28.512 --> 01:29.579
I love talking.

01:29.580 --> 01:30.814
If it was up to me, we'd just sit here,

01:30.815 --> 01:32.082
and I would talk to you all day.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.018
Sure, I get it.

01:35.019 --> 01:38.388
Well, that went rather well.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.323
But I wish you all the best.

01:40.324 --> 01:41.992
And, ladies, don't get rattled
if you walk in there

01:41.993 --> 01:44.153
and they're still laughing
at that Hillary joke I told.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.896
Dr. Lahiri.

01:46.897 --> 01:48.431
Yes. I'm her. Yeah, I'm her.

01:48.432 --> 01:50.200
I'm coming right now.

01:50.201 --> 01:53.803
I would also like to institute
a more streamlined,

01:53.804 --> 01:55.572
hospital-wide email system.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.941
Hmm. Uh, Dr. Lahiri,

01:57.942 --> 02:00.443
I understand you're a single...

02:00.444 --> 02:04.014
uh, you... you recently...
but without a...

02:04.015 --> 02:05.081
Not that you...

02:05.082 --> 02:06.349
Oh, I'm a single mother.

02:06.350 --> 02:08.184
- You're a single mom.
- Yes.

02:08.185 --> 02:10.987
Can you balance that with
doing this stressful job?

02:10.988 --> 02:12.188
Absolutely.

02:12.189 --> 02:14.457
I mean, having a child
has actually given me

02:14.458 --> 02:15.959
so much more focus.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.627
Oh, and I don't exercise.

02:17.628 --> 02:19.129
So that's an extra ten minutes a day

02:19.130 --> 02:21.031
that goes just towards work.

02:21.032 --> 02:22.432
I see.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.434
And as a leader, do you have the ability

02:24.435 --> 02:25.935
to keep your emotions at bay

02:25.936 --> 02:27.937
and think logically
under stressful situations?

02:27.938 --> 02:30.407
My emotions?
Oh, I've learned to eat those.

02:30.408 --> 02:33.677
Not a problem. Yeah, for sure.

02:33.678 --> 02:35.812
Do you ask everyone that question?

02:35.813 --> 02:38.048
Yes, of course.

02:38.049 --> 02:40.583
Uh, finally, is there anything
else you'd like to tell us?

02:40.584 --> 02:42.686
I just wanted to say
what an honor it would be

02:42.687 --> 02:43.953
to lead this department.

02:43.954 --> 02:46.022
When I first entered
this hospital years ago,

02:46.023 --> 02:47.857
what with its modern facilities

02:47.858 --> 02:50.293
and perfectly breaded hospital
cafeteria chicken fingers,

02:50.294 --> 02:52.696
I thought, wow, this is my home.

02:52.697 --> 02:54.931
And under my leadership,
I would want to make sure

02:54.932 --> 02:57.400
that all of my patients' babies
would enter this world

02:57.401 --> 02:59.803
in a loving and peaceful environment.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.673
Thank you for your consideration.

03:05.376 --> 03:07.043
Hey, Jody, I think you butt-dialed me.

03:07.044 --> 03:08.978
So you better hang up before
you start having sex.

03:08.979 --> 03:11.614
No, no. I called you on purpose.

03:11.615 --> 03:13.149
They just emailed out the times

03:13.150 --> 03:15.919
for those candidates
getting final-round interviews.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.454
Mine's at 11:45.

03:17.455 --> 03:19.823
I can't decide if I should
wear my breakfast blazer

03:19.824 --> 03:21.424
or my noonday suit.

03:21.425 --> 03:22.926
It's a real good spot.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.095
I'm right between two fellas
with chronic halitosis,

03:25.096 --> 03:27.230
so I'll be a literal breath
of fresh air.

03:27.231 --> 03:29.532
When is your second interview?

03:29.533 --> 03:32.736
Mindy? Mindy?
Mindy, are you still there?

03:32.737 --> 03:33.937
I actually haven't checked

03:33.938 --> 03:35.638
because I don't even
want the job anymore

03:35.639 --> 03:36.940
because my life is so perfect.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.174
I hope someone else gets it, actually.

03:38.175 --> 03:39.409
#blessed.

03:39.410 --> 03:41.144
Oh, Mindy, what a shame.

03:41.145 --> 03:42.645
You didn't make the cut.

03:42.646 --> 03:44.414
Well, on the bright side,
you'll have more time

03:44.415 --> 03:46.483
to online shop and
follow the saucy adventures

03:46.484 --> 03:49.519
of Miss Olivia Pope.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.620
What the hell?

03:50.621 --> 03:52.756
I am way more qualified than Jody.

03:52.757 --> 03:54.924
I created the hospital
Hawaiian Shirt Day.

03:54.925 --> 03:57.427
That almost took off.

03:57.428 --> 03:59.329
White men get to do everything.

03:59.330 --> 04:00.563
They can hail cabs,

04:00.564 --> 04:01.931
direct Hollywood movies,

04:01.932 --> 04:03.600
host late-night talk shows.

04:03.601 --> 04:07.337
They can even write
in the snow with their pee.

04:07.338 --> 04:11.040
I wish I was a white man.

04:18.682 --> 04:20.450
Whoa, I slept like a log.

04:20.451 --> 04:23.453
Is there a gas leak?

04:24.955 --> 04:26.222
My hands are white.

04:26.223 --> 04:28.525
My voice is low.

04:28.526 --> 04:30.260
I have a...

04:30.261 --> 04:33.196
Circumcision?

04:35.000 --> 04:41.074

04:49.467 --> 04:51.781
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.049
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

04:53.050 --> 04:54.317
Oh, whoa, that is what it's like

04:54.318 --> 04:55.518
to stand up with strong core muscles.

04:55.519 --> 04:58.621
Okay. Okay.

04:58.622 --> 05:00.141
Ooh, damn!

05:00.166 --> 05:02.158
I'm kinda bangable.

05:02.159 --> 05:04.494
Check out my butt. Juicy.

05:04.495 --> 05:06.262
Whoa, am I giving myself a boner?

05:06.263 --> 05:07.463
Cool.

05:07.464 --> 05:09.499
Okay, chill out. You asked for this.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.601
So you're a white man now.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.137
Whoa, bitch, you're a white man now.

05:14.138 --> 05:16.639
Wow, everything about my life
is different as a guy.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.241
Look at this man cave.

05:18.242 --> 05:22.178
Leather furniture,
football stuff, humidor.

05:22.179 --> 05:25.014
So who the hell am I?

05:25.015 --> 05:27.050
Michael Lancaster? That's white as hell.

05:27.051 --> 05:29.319
Basically a Whit Stillman character.

05:29.320 --> 05:33.022
Whoa, I'm so white I know
who Whit Stillman is.

05:33.023 --> 05:35.258
Man, that is a lot of light brown.

05:35.259 --> 05:36.926
Guess I'm not a gay man.

05:36.927 --> 05:38.928
Hmm, no ring.

05:38.929 --> 05:41.364
Looks like I'm a divorced baby daddy.

05:41.365 --> 05:43.900
I bet some skank took me
for all I'm worth.

05:43.901 --> 05:47.237
Ooh, I have to pee.
This is gonna be cool.

05:47.238 --> 05:49.505
Whoa, Niagara Falls much?

05:49.506 --> 05:52.542
I wish my shower had this kind
of water pressure.

05:52.543 --> 05:54.444
Well, now that that's out of the way,

05:54.445 --> 05:57.114
let's see what else this bad boy can do.

06:02.286 --> 06:04.921
Well, it's definitely
not as good for guys.

06:04.922 --> 06:06.556
It's much easier though.

06:06.557 --> 06:09.425
And the finish certainly
has a wow factor.

06:09.426 --> 06:11.060
Oh, crap! I'm late for work!

06:11.061 --> 06:12.696
I'm never gonna get ready in time!

06:14.098 --> 06:15.498
What the hell?

06:15.499 --> 06:16.866
Guys can get dressed in no time

06:16.867 --> 06:18.501
and still look great.

06:18.502 --> 06:22.038
I even have time for one more...

06:22.039 --> 06:24.841
Remember, you're a white guy
named Michael.

06:24.842 --> 06:28.679
You like sports, and chicks,
and classic rock.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.482
Hi, Tam...

06:32.483 --> 06:33.816
Morning, Tamra.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.252
Good morning, Dr. L.
How was your evening?

06:36.253 --> 06:37.954
Really?

06:37.955 --> 06:39.522
But you never ask me how my evening was.

06:39.523 --> 06:40.990
Usually when I walk in,
you tell me I'm late

06:40.991 --> 06:43.459
and I have a stain on my poncho.

06:43.460 --> 06:46.129
Dr. L, you're hilarious.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.797
Obvious, I know.
I'm basically Kevin Hart.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.300
But I crack hilarious jokes
constantly around here,

06:50.301 --> 06:52.001
and no one ever laughs.

06:52.002 --> 06:54.671
You're on a roll.

06:54.672 --> 06:56.673
Whoa, for the first time in my life,

06:56.674 --> 06:57.840
women find me charming.

06:57.841 --> 06:59.442
People find me charming.

06:59.443 --> 07:01.611
Everyone, I have
an important announcement.

07:01.612 --> 07:03.080
Oh.

07:04.915 --> 07:07.116
Wait, none of you are rolling your eyes

07:07.117 --> 07:09.986
or making false guesses
that would ultimately insult me.

07:09.987 --> 07:11.187
Why would we do that?

07:11.188 --> 07:12.488
If you have an announcement
to make, Mike,

07:12.489 --> 07:14.123
we would certainly like to hear it.

07:14.124 --> 07:15.725
Should I take notes?

07:15.726 --> 07:16.926
No, no, no.

07:16.927 --> 07:18.494
Um, my announcement is

07:18.495 --> 07:20.863
I hope everyone has a terrific day.

07:20.864 --> 07:21.898
- Ohh.
- Well.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.000
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

07:24.001 --> 07:25.568
You have a terrific day too, Mike.

07:25.569 --> 07:28.604
Hear, hear. What an effective
use of our time.

07:29.707 --> 07:32.976
Dr. L, I got your usual
from the drug store.

07:32.977 --> 07:35.445
Ah, my eye serum? My gout cream?

07:35.446 --> 07:37.814
What? No, it's
Mega Mass weight gain powder.

07:37.815 --> 07:41.051
Remember, you're trying to
bulk up for swimsuit season?

07:42.353 --> 07:45.455
Holy shit. I'm trying to gain weight?

07:45.456 --> 07:47.991
Being a white man rules.

07:47.992 --> 07:49.392
Hey!

07:49.393 --> 07:52.095
No, never mind. Sorry, thank you.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.400
Ohh!

08:02.873 --> 08:05.608
No, I'm good.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.647
So you're fine
with this course of treatment?

08:11.648 --> 08:12.882
You're not gonna disagree with me

08:12.883 --> 08:14.884
because you read something
different on WebMD?

08:14.885 --> 08:17.387
No, of course not.
I mean, you're the doctor.

08:17.388 --> 08:18.888
Whatever you say goes.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.423
Okay.

08:20.424 --> 08:22.025
Turns out, everyone's right.

08:22.026 --> 08:24.394
Being a white man is the best.

08:24.395 --> 08:25.762
I can eat whatever I want.

08:25.763 --> 08:27.397
People think everything
I say is hilarious.

08:27.398 --> 08:29.365
And all of culture is designed

08:29.366 --> 08:31.300
to entertain and delight me.

08:32.936 --> 08:34.937
Dr. L, it's time
for your second-round interview

08:34.938 --> 08:35.972
at the hospital.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.273
I brought your blue shirt,

08:37.274 --> 08:38.808
'cause it makes your eyes
look more lupine.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.643
Wait, I got a second-round interview?

08:40.644 --> 08:41.844
Wait, my eyes are blue?

08:41.845 --> 08:43.413
Of course you got a second interview.

08:43.414 --> 08:46.049
You're Dr. L.
People never say no to you.

08:46.050 --> 08:48.985
Remember that policeman
let you shoot his gun?

08:48.986 --> 08:51.854
Wow, the meritocracy is real.

08:51.855 --> 08:54.190
As long as you're male and white.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.027
Michael!

08:58.028 --> 08:59.896
Hey. How you doing?

08:59.897 --> 09:02.265
We, uh... we play racquetball together.

09:02.266 --> 09:03.866
- Ah.
- We do?

09:03.867 --> 09:07.170
You're right, can't call
what we do playing, right?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.638
Well, Mike and I go way back as well.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.840
Our kids have the same ADHD doctor.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.475
Between your little monsters and mine,

09:12.476 --> 09:15.845
we bought that psychiatrist
his boat, am I right?

09:15.846 --> 09:18.448
So should I talk to you guys
about my qualifications?

09:18.449 --> 09:21.484
No, it's okay. No, we know 'em.

09:21.485 --> 09:23.252
Well, if you guys are worried

09:23.253 --> 09:25.521
that I won't be able to juggle
this job with my three kids,

09:25.522 --> 09:26.856
don't be because...

09:26.857 --> 09:27.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.093
Why would we worry about that?

09:30.094 --> 09:33.329
I mean, doesn't Nicole
take care of them at her house?

09:33.330 --> 09:35.098
Oh, no.

09:35.099 --> 09:37.433
Did Nicole have to go back
to Tranquil Palms?

09:37.434 --> 09:39.135
I thought the shocks were working.

09:39.136 --> 09:41.437
No, no, no, she's fine. I think.

09:41.438 --> 09:44.807
But don't I need to tell you why
I would be an effective leader?

09:44.808 --> 09:48.311
I mean, I heard you were
asking other people that, so...

09:48.312 --> 09:50.480
I don't need to ask you.

09:50.481 --> 09:52.582
I can tell you're a good leader
just by looking at you.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.284
Yeah, I'd follow
that jaw line off a cliff.

09:55.285 --> 09:56.853
Damn, I could get used to this.

09:56.854 --> 09:58.287
Awesome.

09:58.288 --> 10:00.123
So is that it?

10:00.124 --> 10:01.257
Bros?

10:01.258 --> 10:02.959
You know, look, between you and me,

10:02.960 --> 10:04.460
and we're gonna meet
with a couple other people,

10:04.461 --> 10:06.095
but you got this thing locked in.

10:07.097 --> 10:09.198
I'm dying for a Scotch. Is it noon?

10:09.199 --> 10:11.801
Well, this has been
an honor and a privilege.

10:11.802 --> 10:14.770
A real male privilege.

10:14.771 --> 10:16.939
Guys, this day is amazing.

10:16.940 --> 10:18.608
I killed it at my job interview,

10:18.609 --> 10:20.977
and then at a restaurant
I ate a whole rack of ribs

10:20.978 --> 10:22.345
and no one looked grossed out.

10:22.346 --> 10:25.248
That's great, Michael.
Jody also crushed his interview.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.582
Thank you.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.784
Oh, of course,
'cause you're also a white man.

10:28.785 --> 10:30.019
Yes, I am.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.221
I was voted whitest
in my high school class,

10:32.222 --> 10:34.257
- in a very competitive year.
- Oh.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.459
So, um, just to be clear,

10:36.460 --> 10:38.261
did no women get second interviews?

10:38.262 --> 10:41.130
Like who? Like that little
dust devil, Dr. Lee?

10:41.131 --> 10:43.666
No. She is not leadership material.

10:43.667 --> 10:47.436
Unless it's leader of, like,
say a women's book club or...

10:48.539 --> 10:49.739
Well, you know very well

10:49.740 --> 10:50.973
that I'm the leader of that book club.

10:50.974 --> 10:52.308
Ohh.

10:52.309 --> 10:53.643
We are reading
"The Hours" at the moment.

10:53.644 --> 10:54.777
Although really, it's just an excuse

10:54.778 --> 10:56.312
to get together and drink Zin.

10:56.313 --> 10:58.214
But anyway, kudos to the two of you.

10:58.215 --> 11:00.016
Yeah, we should celebrate.

11:00.017 --> 11:02.785
Check out da club.
Have a real lads' night.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.153
Wait, I'm invited?

11:04.154 --> 11:06.022
Aren't you guys worried
about me getting too drunk

11:06.023 --> 11:07.390
and belching or groping someone?

11:09.259 --> 11:11.060
We'd be disappointed if you didn't.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.795
Michael, you have to come.

11:12.796 --> 11:14.096
We can't very well have a lads' night

11:14.097 --> 11:16.032
with just two of the Three Muff-keteers.

11:16.033 --> 11:17.366
What's this new feeling?

11:17.367 --> 11:19.535
- Okay.
- Inclusion.

11:22.839 --> 11:24.740
- There we go.
- Party time.

11:24.741 --> 11:26.309
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Cheers.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.678
Okay.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.014
Whoa, I really felt that.

11:32.015 --> 11:34.450
I guess this is what it's like
to have 0% body fat.

11:34.451 --> 11:35.885
How 'bout another round, fellas?

11:35.886 --> 11:37.186
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, I'll have

11:37.187 --> 11:38.821
a strawberry daiquiri
with extra whipped cream.

11:38.822 --> 11:39.822
A what?

11:39.823 --> 11:40.856
Actually just the whipped cream.

11:40.857 --> 11:42.124
I have a C-section in the morning,

11:42.125 --> 11:43.993
and I don't want to be hungover for it.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.928
Can't wear sunglasses
during a procedure, I've tried.

11:45.929 --> 11:47.597
Yeah, like a procedure's
ever stopped you.

11:47.598 --> 11:51.968
Besides, these are from
our new friends over there.

11:51.969 --> 11:54.136
Whoa, the only person
I've ever sent a drink to

11:54.137 --> 11:55.938
is Wolf Blitzer,
and he threw it in my face.

11:55.939 --> 11:57.139
Cheers, you guys.

12:00.077 --> 12:01.310
Hello, good evening.

12:01.311 --> 12:03.679
Hi. I like your eyes.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.648
Thank you. I like your lip gloss.

12:05.649 --> 12:08.484
Is that Kylie Jenner?
That stuff is the best.

12:08.485 --> 12:10.186
Huh?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.021
I mean, it's the best tasting.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.056
Like, when I'm macking
on honeys, hey-yo!

12:14.057 --> 12:15.558
You're weird.

12:15.559 --> 12:20.463
But that's cool because you're so hot.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.901
Well, I guess this makes up

12:25.902 --> 12:27.637
for none of my female friends
wanting to experiment

12:27.638 --> 12:29.472
with me in college.

12:35.812 --> 12:38.081
Whoa, there's a naked girl in my bed.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.817
Double whoa, three condoms!

12:41.818 --> 12:44.353
Damn, I'm a stud.

12:44.354 --> 12:47.523
Oh, she slept over? How thirsty.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.512
Hey.

12:51.629 --> 12:53.462
Hey.

12:53.463 --> 12:56.666
You were... amazing last night.

12:57.748 --> 12:59.835
Except for when you kept
trying to go down on yourself.

12:59.836 --> 13:01.771
I got confused.

13:01.772 --> 13:03.806
Last night was cool.

13:03.807 --> 13:05.074
I think it made me gay.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.609
What?

13:06.610 --> 13:08.010
Damn it!

13:08.011 --> 13:09.980
Why does this keep happening to me?

13:11.846 --> 13:14.481
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna miss my delivery.

13:14.522 --> 13:16.595
Down, down, get down! I gotta pee.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.253
Tamra, hey, where's my patient?
Is she okay?

13:24.278 --> 13:25.695
- She's dead.
- What?

13:25.696 --> 13:28.081
Ha ha ha ha. J/K, J/K, J/K.

13:28.106 --> 13:30.032
She's fine.
Dr. Lee's doing your caesarean.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.234
- Don't worry.
- Oh, Dr. Lee?

13:32.235 --> 13:35.237
No, if that baby imprints on a loser,
it'll be lame for life.

13:35.238 --> 13:36.739
Let's cut.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.507
All right, we're all done.

13:38.508 --> 13:40.109
Great job, everybody.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.744
Got a beautiful baby girl.

13:41.745 --> 13:43.679
Hold on,
Dr. Lee just did that

13:43.680 --> 13:45.314
in half the time it would have taken me.

13:45.315 --> 13:46.982
Have I been all wrong about her?

13:46.983 --> 13:49.685
She may wear shoes that
make her feet look prosthetic,

13:49.686 --> 13:52.521
but it looks like Irene Lee
is a great doctor.

13:52.522 --> 13:53.522
Great job.

13:56.193 --> 13:57.560
- Irene!
- Ahh!

13:57.561 --> 13:59.628
Sorry, I guess that's scary
when a man does it.

13:59.629 --> 14:01.664
Hey, thank you so much
for covering for me.

14:01.665 --> 14:04.300
I'm so sorry, but I have a good excuse.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.502
I slept with a woman for the first time,

14:06.503 --> 14:08.304
- and if I may...
- It's okay.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.106
I'm used to covering for you guys

14:10.107 --> 14:11.540
when you drink too much.

14:11.541 --> 14:14.610
I can't drink, because of
my irritable bowel syndrome.

14:14.611 --> 14:17.213
Well, I just wanted to say
I watched the whole delivery,

14:17.214 --> 14:19.915
and I had no idea you were
such a good surgeon.

14:19.916 --> 14:22.284
I mean, how on Earth did you
not get a second interview

14:22.285 --> 14:24.420
for the department head job and I did?

14:24.421 --> 14:25.721
I don't know,

14:25.722 --> 14:27.923
but I'm sure they have their reasons.

14:27.924 --> 14:29.658
But listen, I'm rooting for you,

14:29.659 --> 14:32.228
even though up until this moment
you've never talked to me.

14:32.229 --> 14:34.730
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to treat myself

14:34.731 --> 14:36.866
to some post-surgery raisins.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.234
Ugh, what is this feeling?

14:38.235 --> 14:39.468
Rats.

14:39.469 --> 14:42.171
Stupid conscience.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.507
Ah, Michael, howdy-doo?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.509
Say, maybe you can help me out here.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.677
Got a second interview for
that department head job,

14:48.678 --> 14:50.045
but I don't know which tie to wear.

14:50.046 --> 14:53.516
Stripes or foxy lady?

14:53.517 --> 14:54.917
You got a second interview?

14:54.918 --> 14:56.218
I was surprised too.

14:56.219 --> 14:57.820
After a few costly mistakes,

14:57.821 --> 14:59.889
I was getting ready to retire.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.390
Yeah, I was gonna move
closer to my daughter,

15:01.391 --> 15:03.092
try to make amends with her wife,

15:03.093 --> 15:05.929
but who am I to say no to a raise, hmm?

15:07.597 --> 15:09.064
Even that bag of bones

15:09.065 --> 15:12.334
got a second interview and Irene didn't?

15:12.335 --> 15:14.003
Tamra, Tamra.

15:14.004 --> 15:15.037
What's up, Dr. L?

15:15.038 --> 15:16.439
You need a shot of penicillin again?

15:16.440 --> 15:17.540
You're gonna become immune.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.375
Can you believe that old-ass Dr. Ledreau

15:19.376 --> 15:21.343
got a second interview
for the head of OB?

15:21.344 --> 15:22.611
Yeah, so?

15:22.612 --> 15:23.746
So? That is unfair.

15:23.747 --> 15:25.080
He is terrible.

15:25.081 --> 15:27.249
He only congratulates
mothers when it's a boy.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.984
Meanwhile, Dr. Lee
wasn't even considered,

15:28.985 --> 15:30.453
and she's amazing.

15:30.454 --> 15:31.754
Doesn't that make you mad?

15:31.755 --> 15:32.955
Not really.

15:32.956 --> 15:34.557
I mean, I'm hella used to it.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.025
It's just one of those
annoying racist things

15:36.026 --> 15:37.293
white people do.

15:37.294 --> 15:38.928
Like assuming I voted for Obama.

15:38.929 --> 15:41.163
I mean, I did, but it wasn't easy

15:41.164 --> 15:43.098
given his support of
public sector intervention

15:43.099 --> 15:44.533
in the energy market.

15:44.534 --> 15:46.068
Just doesn't make any sense.

15:46.069 --> 15:48.871
I know, it's like let the
invisible hand do its thing.

15:48.872 --> 15:50.739
Uh...

15:50.740 --> 15:53.342
Tamra, can I...
can I tell you something?

15:53.343 --> 15:56.078
Come here.

15:56.079 --> 15:57.214
What?

15:59.616 --> 16:03.052
I am not a white dude.

16:03.053 --> 16:04.220
I'm a woman of color

16:04.221 --> 16:05.989
trapped inside the body
of a Caucasian male.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.726
Oh, my goodness.

16:10.727 --> 16:12.995
Oh, my goodness.

16:12.996 --> 16:15.197
I have been waiting my whole life

16:15.198 --> 16:18.334
for someone to confide
something like this to me.

16:18.335 --> 16:19.568
The gender part.

16:19.569 --> 16:21.537
The racial part is offensive,
and I cannot,

16:21.538 --> 16:23.706
but I'm on board.

16:23.707 --> 16:25.407
Thank you, Tamra.

16:25.408 --> 16:27.042
But what I really want is for Dr. Lee

16:27.043 --> 16:29.211
to get the job she deserves.

16:29.212 --> 16:30.713
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:30.714 --> 16:32.448
I don't even care
as long as I'm not the one

16:32.449 --> 16:34.551
who has to learn a lesson.

16:39.189 --> 16:42.491
Ugh, this is worse than I thought.

16:42.516 --> 16:44.451
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:44.452 --> 16:46.595
Oh, hey.

16:46.596 --> 16:48.397
Are you here for sloppy joe day?

16:48.398 --> 16:51.255
I got a second one to share
with my cats at home.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.469
Irene, you deserve the head
of the department job

16:53.470 --> 16:55.971
more than me or Jody or maybe anyone,

16:55.972 --> 16:57.239
and we are gonna help you get it.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.941
I don't know.

16:58.942 --> 17:00.876
I mean, I got an interview.

17:00.877 --> 17:02.444
I thought I did a good job.

17:02.445 --> 17:05.314
I double-bagged
on undershirts for my sweating.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.383
I think they just found someone better.

17:07.384 --> 17:08.717
No, they don't know what they're doing.

17:08.718 --> 17:10.653
The system is completely
rigged by those honkies.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.021
Please.

17:12.021 --> 17:13.388
I just don't want to be that pushy woman

17:13.390 --> 17:15.223
who thinks she's so qualified.

17:15.224 --> 17:17.092
Also, I'm treated well.

17:17.093 --> 17:19.028
Look how they loaded my joe.

17:19.029 --> 17:21.063
No extra charge.

17:21.064 --> 17:22.330
You can't just sit back

17:22.332 --> 17:24.032
and let them treat you
like you're invisible.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.701
Where-where'd you go?

17:25.702 --> 17:28.237
Sorry, I was bussing my table.

17:28.238 --> 17:30.139
Well, if the system is so rigged,

17:30.140 --> 17:31.774
what's the point of even trying?

17:31.775 --> 17:33.175
Well...

17:33.176 --> 17:35.144
As a white man,
I cannot say what I want to say

17:35.145 --> 17:36.512
because I could get sued.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.614
So, Tamra, will you please
explain the problem here?

17:38.615 --> 17:40.950
Girl, you can't dress like a loser

17:40.951 --> 17:42.518
and expect to make it in the patriarchy.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.787
You don't see Michelle Obama
exercising with school kids

17:44.788 --> 17:46.589
in a cat sweater and flip-flops.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.123
It's like you're trying to look bad.

17:48.124 --> 17:50.326
Let us help you.

17:50.327 --> 17:52.695
Okay, I'll try.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.063
Step one, you have to look good

17:54.064 --> 17:55.331
to be treated good.

17:55.332 --> 17:56.665
White people can look like garbage

17:56.666 --> 17:57.766
and still be treated well.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.001
Look at Adam Sandler.

17:59.002 --> 18:00.636
He wear swim trunks to the Oscars.

18:00.637 --> 18:01.804
You have to work harder.

18:01.805 --> 18:03.806
I don't really pay attention to fashion.

18:03.807 --> 18:06.642
Really? I thought your outfit
came straight from Milan.

18:06.643 --> 18:07.977
Actually, most of my clothes

18:07.978 --> 18:09.612
are from the hospital's lost and found.

18:09.613 --> 18:11.246
Oh, God, I give up.

18:11.247 --> 18:12.948
I mean, I don't give up.

18:12.949 --> 18:14.116
You're my altruistic mission.

18:14.117 --> 18:15.918
But in the words of Jerry Maguire,

18:15.919 --> 18:17.753
help me help you.

18:17.754 --> 18:20.022
I love that movie!

18:20.023 --> 18:23.993
Bonnie Hunt is my style icon.

18:23.994 --> 18:27.830
I can tell from your reaction
that was a bad thing to say.

18:27.831 --> 18:29.665
I really want this job.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.400
Tell me what to wear. I'll do it.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.068
Okay, now you're learning.

18:33.069 --> 18:34.770
Step two, take the "personal"

18:34.771 --> 18:35.904
out of "personnel."

18:35.905 --> 18:37.706
As a woman, the men interviewing you

18:37.707 --> 18:40.009
are gonna get hung up
on your work/life balance.

18:40.010 --> 18:41.143
Don't let them.

18:41.144 --> 18:42.945
What if they ask me about my cats?

18:42.946 --> 18:45.114
They do take up a lot of my time.

18:45.115 --> 18:47.082
Especially Aragorn.

18:47.083 --> 18:50.508
Don't talk about Aragorn.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.883
Now for steps three and four: T and A.

18:52.908 --> 18:55.324
So you know a secret weapon
us women can hold over men

18:55.349 --> 18:56.668
is sex appeal.

18:56.693 --> 18:57.926
Go like that.

18:57.927 --> 18:59.762
My doctor told me I don't have that.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.764
Oh, no, no, sexy isn't just about looks.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.532
It's about confidence.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.701
If you think you look good,
others will catch on.

19:05.702 --> 19:09.571
I guess I could try to be confident.

19:09.572 --> 19:11.373
Exactly, yes.

19:11.374 --> 19:13.475
See now, as a guy, I have to
spend most of my energy

19:13.476 --> 19:14.943
trying not to stare at your cleavage.

19:14.944 --> 19:16.111
Voila.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.313
I'm already off my game.

19:18.314 --> 19:21.083
Hey, he's allowed in the women's room?

19:21.084 --> 19:22.885
But when I go into the men's room,

19:22.886 --> 19:26.188
everyone's like, "Beverly,
put your camera away."

19:26.189 --> 19:28.757
I gotta deuce.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.325
And now for step five.

19:30.326 --> 19:33.796
Okay, it's time to play the
most important card in the deck.

19:33.797 --> 19:34.863
What kind of deck?

19:34.864 --> 19:36.986
- Uno?
- Magic: The Gathering?

19:37.011 --> 19:38.400
Oh, don't push me, Dr. Lee.

19:38.401 --> 19:39.535
The race card.

19:39.536 --> 19:41.170
So you are gonna call the committee

19:41.171 --> 19:43.305
and demand a second interview
and point out

19:43.306 --> 19:45.708
that all the people that made
it to round two are white.

19:45.709 --> 19:47.142
Really?

19:47.143 --> 19:48.210
Will that work?

19:48.211 --> 19:49.378
Oh, it'll work.

19:49.379 --> 19:50.813
Because every white person's worst fear

19:50.814 --> 19:52.147
is being called racist.

19:52.148 --> 19:54.650
It's their equivalent of
experiencing actual racism.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.018
Come on, Irene.

19:56.019 --> 19:59.154
You deserve this more than
Dr. Ledreau, Jody, or even me.

20:08.064 --> 20:09.398
Dr. L, you better stop pacing.

20:09.399 --> 20:11.133
You get too much exercise as it is.

20:11.134 --> 20:13.368
I know, I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.

20:13.369 --> 20:15.537
Irene's been in with
the committee for so long.

20:15.538 --> 20:17.272
I'm worried she's gonna tell
that really boring story

20:17.273 --> 20:19.174
about the time she decided
not to go to the water park.

20:19.175 --> 20:21.111
Oh, my God.

20:23.313 --> 20:24.780
Well, how'd it go?

20:24.781 --> 20:26.014
I did everything you said.

20:26.015 --> 20:28.050
Awesome. That is great news.

20:28.051 --> 20:29.318
But I didn't get the job.

20:29.319 --> 20:31.896
- What?
- Like most of the interviews that I get,

20:31.921 --> 20:34.114
it felt like a courtesy
to avoid a lawsuit.

20:34.139 --> 20:35.488
I'm really sorry, Dr. Lee.

20:35.513 --> 20:37.782
No, no, nuh-uh!

20:39.395 --> 20:41.264
Ex-squeeze me?

20:45.254 --> 20:48.990
Everyone one of you
needs to sit down right now.

20:50.273 --> 20:53.609
Dr. Lee is by far the most qualified
person for this position.

20:53.610 --> 20:54.910
And might I remind you

20:54.911 --> 20:57.079
that many of our patients are not white,

20:57.080 --> 20:59.448
and all of them are women.

20:59.449 --> 21:00.983
Wow.

21:00.984 --> 21:04.253
Your commitment to diversity
is really impressive,

21:04.254 --> 21:06.555
which is exactly
what we need around here.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.856
Congratulations, you got the job.

21:07.857 --> 21:09.491
How dare you?

21:09.492 --> 21:11.360
Stop trying to give this job
to a white man.

21:11.361 --> 21:12.928
Dr. Lee deserves it.

21:12.929 --> 21:15.164
Well, honestly, our last department head

21:15.165 --> 21:16.799
was a black woman and a lesbian,

21:16.800 --> 21:18.834
which I don't think
we get enough credit for,

21:18.835 --> 21:19.868
and she was great.

21:19.869 --> 21:21.203
She was fine.

21:21.204 --> 21:22.638
But this time we just thought

21:22.639 --> 21:24.006
we'd go in a different direction.

21:24.007 --> 21:25.040
So you're telling me

21:25.041 --> 21:26.775
that two women of color in a row

21:26.776 --> 21:28.110
would be a little too much?

21:28.111 --> 21:30.078
Even though the department heads
before that

21:30.079 --> 21:32.247
were an endless parade
of middle-aged white men?

21:32.248 --> 21:34.082
I mean, look at these pictures.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.418
It's like the cast
of a Clint Eastwood movie.

21:36.419 --> 21:38.821
Damn, dog, Jody was right.

21:38.822 --> 21:40.522
His picture would look great up there.

21:40.523 --> 21:42.491
Listen, Mike, you were our top choice,

21:42.492 --> 21:44.193
but if you don't want the job

21:44.194 --> 21:45.961
then we'll give it to Dr. Ledreau.

21:45.962 --> 21:48.130
He actually had this job
back in the '70s.

21:48.131 --> 21:50.132
Ledreau? But he's basically senile.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.867
And everybody knows he killed Barbara.

21:51.868 --> 21:54.102
Nobody jumps off a cruise ship
the first night.

21:54.103 --> 21:55.604
Well, he was not convicted,

21:55.605 --> 21:58.540
and off the record,
Barbara was a difficult woman.

21:58.541 --> 22:00.409
She was.

22:00.410 --> 22:02.010
Listen, Mike, thanks for coming in,

22:02.011 --> 22:04.213
and thanks for starting
this lively discussion.

22:04.214 --> 22:06.248
It's been a lot of fun.

22:06.249 --> 22:07.916
Damn it, the system's more

22:07.917 --> 22:10.752
rigged than I thought.

22:10.753 --> 22:12.254
There's a million great things about

22:12.255 --> 22:13.589
being a white guy,
and that's just counting

22:13.590 --> 22:15.424
the things you can do with your penis.

22:15.425 --> 22:18.794
But the sad thing is having the
ability to help other people

22:18.795 --> 22:21.630
and most of the time just not doing it.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.565
It's just so easy not to.

22:23.566 --> 22:25.868
Your life is so carefree,
you start wondering

22:25.869 --> 22:28.237
why other people
just don't help themselves,

22:28.238 --> 22:31.207
because you think life is just
as easy for everyone else.

22:33.109 --> 22:37.045
Wow, I actually miss being
interesting and different.

22:37.046 --> 22:41.083
Wish I were an Indian woman again.

22:58.301 --> 23:01.370
Oh, my God. I'm me again. Thank God.

23:01.371 --> 23:03.538
My boobs. Hey, why do they feel smaller?

23:03.539 --> 23:05.440
Anyway, I'm so relieved.

23:05.441 --> 23:07.542
I even forgot all
the sports trivia I learned,

23:07.543 --> 23:08.710
thank God.

23:08.711 --> 23:11.580
Remember, Mindy, sit down to pee.

23:20.556 --> 23:22.824
Hey, Irene. How's it going?

23:22.825 --> 23:24.927
Pretty good,
but I'm getting pretty sweaty

23:24.928 --> 23:26.662
from this Alfredo steam.

23:26.663 --> 23:29.364
So you probably heard that Dr. Ledreau

23:29.365 --> 23:31.633
got the department head position.

23:31.634 --> 23:33.568
Another white man, go figure.

23:33.569 --> 23:35.370
And, you know, there's a lot of evidence

23:35.371 --> 23:36.638
that he killed his wife.

23:36.639 --> 23:39.075
I'm listening to a podcast
about her disappearance.

23:41.077 --> 23:42.477
I wanted to apologize to you

23:42.478 --> 23:43.879
for what I said the other day,

23:43.880 --> 23:45.647
about us being an Asian clique.

23:45.648 --> 23:47.683
I was wrong.

23:47.684 --> 23:51.053
And I wanted to know if you
would ever want to hang out.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.821
I think we'd be good friends.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.757
Yeah, that... that'd be nice.

23:55.758 --> 23:56.825
You want some Alfredo?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.093
I thought you would never ask.

23:58.094 --> 23:59.695
- It smells delicious.
- Dig in.

23:59.696 --> 24:01.897
- Is this from the cafeteria?
- Yeah.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.465
You know what else is good there?

24:03.466 --> 24:04.566
- The chicken fingers.
- The chicken fingers.

24:04.567 --> 24:06.668
- Yes!
- So good.

24:06.669 --> 24:07.737
Go to bed.
