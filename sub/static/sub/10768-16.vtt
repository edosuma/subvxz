Let's watch some TV.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.180
<i>Carlton, I think Montel is on.</i>

14:30.690 --> 14:32.710
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Next on Montel Williams...</i>

14:32.890 --> 14:36.450
<i>...Women Who Won't Marry
and the Losers Who Ask Them.</i>

14:39.230 --> 14:41.060
Give me that.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.220
<i>MAN [IN SOUTHERN ACCENT]:
Yes, folks, at Willie's World of Wheels...</i>

14:43.400 --> 14:45.800
<i>...we lease every kind
of transportation imaginable.</i>

14:45.970 --> 14:50.170
<i>Lease a truck, lease a car,
lease a van, lease a bus, lease a tractor.</i>

14:52.910 --> 14:56.780
G, to the kitchen, please.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.310
Come on, Rain Man.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.380
VY:
Hey, babe.

15:11.260 --> 15:12.850
Are you hungry, baby?

15:13.030 --> 15:14.160
[WILL SIGHS]

15:14.330 --> 15:18.130
- Not especially.
- Come on, you've got to eat something.

15:18.770 --> 15:21.240
All right, just give me the same thing
Uncle Phil has.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.500
Just make mine a single-sized serving.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.440
Here you go, sweetheart.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.810
Hey, thanks a lot, Aunt Viv.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.380
Oh, can you cut up my chicken finger
for me, please?

15:35.550 --> 15:37.850
Of course, dear.

15:38.350 --> 15:41.220
Uncle Phil, my biscuit needs some butter.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.350
Then I suggest you butter it.

15:44.830 --> 15:47.850
My God, man, I'm in a wheelchair.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.800
I've noticed.

15:49.970 --> 15:51.730
I've noticed a lot of things lately...

15:51.900 --> 15:54.300
...like you moping around here,
acting all helpless.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.740
You can do some things for yourself,
you know.

15:56.910 --> 16:01.470
Sir, when you're finished eating,
I've pre-pasted your toothbrush upstairs.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.480
Thank you, Geoffrey.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.440
You should be happy, Uncle Phil.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.020
You didn't want me to get married
and now I'm not.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.210
Will, we know you're upset about Lisa.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.850
Look, you know what?
I just wanna forget that she ever existed.

16:17.030 --> 16:19.860
I never even wanna hear her name again.

16:20.030 --> 16:23.800
Which reminds me. Lisa called.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.060
Come on, Will, it's time to go to therapy.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.070
Oh, no. I'm not going anywhere with you.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.470
Every time I get around you,
I wind up getting hurt.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.180
You are so accident-prone.

16:50.190 --> 16:52.560
Will, I am really disappointed in you.

16:52.730 --> 16:53.720
[SIGHS]

16:53.900 --> 16:55.360
Please, not another lecture.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.360
Well, someone has to say it.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.260
Being in a wheelchair is no excuse...

16:59.440 --> 17:02.560
...for wearing the same shirt
two days in a row.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.369
WILL:
Hilary.

17:06.540 --> 17:09.980
Look, you don't know what it's like
to lose a fiancÃ©e.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.210
Hello?

17:14.119 --> 17:17.180
I was engaged last year, remember?

17:17.349 --> 17:20.690
- Bungee accident?
- Oh.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.589
Sorry, Hil.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.460
You would think hitting the concrete
like that would've made more of an impact.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.460
Sorry.

17:32.940 --> 17:37.070
Will, we were gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

17:37.610 --> 17:42.170
But we never even would've been engaged
if he hadn't been so persistent.

17:42.350 --> 17:46.910
God, I must have turned him down
like 10 times before we even went out. Ha.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.210
Really?

17:48.690 --> 17:50.740
You know what made me
finally change my mind?

17:50.920 --> 17:53.860
That big old rock he put on your finger?

17:54.020 --> 17:55.960
Well, besides that.

17:56.890 --> 18:02.760
It was knowing that no matter what I said
or what I did or how I acted...

18:02.930 --> 18:04.730
...he would always be there for me.

18:07.340 --> 18:11.470
The point is, Will,
if she really means something to you...

18:11.640 --> 18:13.110
...take a lesson from my fiancÃ©.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.540
Don't give up.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.270
God, I miss him.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.380
Poor, poor...

18:27.190 --> 18:29.890
Tip of the tongue, Will.
Please help me out.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.590
- Trevor.
- Trevor. Thanks.

18:35.370 --> 18:37.060
WILL:
Wait, Hilary.

18:37.230 --> 18:40.690
Hey, you know what? I think you're right.
Maybe I did give up too easy.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.200
- I'm gonna call Lisa right now.
LISA: Will.

18:43.810 --> 18:46.540
Damn, you got good ears, girl.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.080
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, you got that right.

18:53.920 --> 18:57.350
- Hilary, do you mind?
- Oh, no, go ahead.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.520
Oh. Duh.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.660
- Hey, look, Lisa...
- No, Will.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.300
When I said we needed to talk...

19:10.470 --> 19:13.770
...I meant that I need to talk
and you need to listen.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.840
Will, you are stupid.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.640
Well, stupid is as stupid does.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.640
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

19:24.010 --> 19:27.470
I don't know, but the movie
made like a half a billion dollars.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.080
So I say one thing
that you don't wanna hear and that's it?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.810
You just shut me out
without even letting me explain?

19:33.990 --> 19:38.690
"Will, I don't want to marry you"
seems pretty self-explanatory.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.950
Well, you're wrong.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.000
Will, I love you.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.940
But I feel like the only reason
you asked me to marry you...

19:53.110 --> 19:55.670
...is because you're feeling vulnerable
right now.

19:56.350 --> 20:00.080
Well, getting shot kind of has that effect
on a brother.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.310
I understand that,
but what's gonna happen...

20:02.490 --> 20:05.480
...when you're back on your feet
and feeling like yourself again?

20:05.660 --> 20:10.020
Baby, I don't wanna have to shoot you
every six months just to hold on to you.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.450
Look, Lisa...

20:12.630 --> 20:17.070
...when that bullet hit me,
I gotta admit, it scared the hell out of me.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.500
But it made me realize...

20:18.670 --> 20:21.800
...that maybe I don't have all the time
in the world like I thought.

20:22.510 --> 20:25.240
I mean, who's to say
what's gonna happen tomorrow...

20:25.410 --> 20:28.100
...or next week or the week after that?

20:28.280 --> 20:31.470
All I know is that I love you.

20:31.650 --> 20:35.110
And, Lisa, believe me,
that is never gonna change.

20:39.220 --> 20:42.060
Well, in that case, the answer is yes.

Yes?

20:44.130 --> 20:46.720
Ha, ha. Yes.

You wouldn't really bust a cap at me,
though, would you?

21:02.080 --> 21:05.340
- Not unless I have to. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.750
- So you think we should tell your family?
- Oh.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.680

Come on out here, guys.

Time for a toast.
Carlton, get some glasses.

Whoa. Dom Perignon, the good stuff.

Tyler and I were saving it
for our honeymoon. Ha, ha.

Trevor, Hilary.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.780
Right, Trevor, whatever.

21:39.420 --> 21:43.110
Anyway, I figured it was the least
I could do with all the injuries I've caused.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.220
- Thank you.
- It ain't nothing, Hil. Oh. Unh.
