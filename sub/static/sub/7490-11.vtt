WEBVTT

00:02.792 --> 00:04.709
I got it! Guys, I got it!

00:04.792 --> 00:06.583
The line at Game Player was a mile long.

00:06.667 --> 00:09.041
I didn't get any sleep,
but it was worth it.

00:09.125 --> 00:13.208
I am the proud owner of Kung Fu Cop 77.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.000
-Nice!
-Yeah!

00:15.083 --> 00:17.959
I know what you have to go through
when there's a hot new game on the market.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.834
I had to wait two hours
when French Horn Hero came out.

00:22.041 --> 00:24.291
There was a line for French Horn Hero?

00:24.375 --> 00:27.625
No, there was a line of jocks waiting
to see who was gonna buy it.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.625
-Hey, guys.
-All, Hey, Kim.

00:32.250 --> 00:37.083
Yo, Eddie, I heard Stacy Weisman
in your gym class really likes you.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.583
She likes me? I'm gonna ask her out.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.375
Do you even know who she is?

00:42.500 --> 00:45.291
No. But she's a girl, and that's my type.

00:47.333 --> 00:50.458
Don't ask me how I know,
'cause I'm not revealing my sources.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.083
Let's just say I know people.
I'm dialed in.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.500
He accidentally walked into the girls'
bathroom and heard her talking.

00:57.917 --> 01:01.208
Whatever, Kim. My point is,
I had my ear to the ground.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.834
You had your ear to the ground
because security tackled you

01:03.917 --> 01:05.291
for being in the girls' bathroom.

01:09.709 --> 01:14.583
Whoa, Kim, that necklace is the ugliest,
creepiest thing I've ever seen in my life.

01:14.667 --> 01:15.542
Can I have it?

01:16.208 --> 01:17.500
No, you can't have it!

01:18.583 --> 01:20.959
My Aunt Francie gave me some
of her jewelry from the seventies.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.750
She's staying with us,
so I have to wear it.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.500
She calls this necklace the Dragon's Eye,
and says it has magical powers.

01:27.917 --> 01:29.458
- Oh, that's pretty cool.
- Nice.

01:29.792 --> 01:33.166
She also says she's engaged
to the Paul Revere statue at the library.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.083
All right, time for gym class.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.583
I'm gonna show Stacy Weisman
what I've got.

01:41.667 --> 01:42.875
Yeah.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.417
-Oh!

01:45.667 --> 01:48.083
My mom says I'm not gonna have
these legs forever,

01:48.166 --> 01:50.291
so baby, I'm gonna use 'em.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.917
Well, I got to first base
with Stacy Weisman.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.917
Huh, I told you my sources were right.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.917
Not exactly. We were playing softball,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.750
I asked her out,
and she hit me with first base.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.125
Turns out, she likes Steve Hubbard.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.041
That's the guy who stole my bike.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.250
Why do girls always go for bad boys?

02:55.583 --> 02:59.375
Because sometimes they give them bikes
that used to belong to other people.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.959
Okay, everyone, I've not shaved
in over a month.

03:07.041 --> 03:10.625
Behold my full blown man-stache.

03:15.208 --> 03:17.667
My Aunt Connie has a thicker man-stache.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.834
Aw, it's cute!
Like a little moldy shoelace.

03:24.333 --> 03:28.458
Cute? This is the same mustache
that Bobby Wasabi has.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.375
It really started bushing out
when I tried this.

03:33.542 --> 03:37.208
Dr. Follicle's Hair Fertilizer
is the beard and mustache grower

03:37.250 --> 03:40.875
endorsed by lumberjacks, bikers,
and rabbis.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.333
Wow, those three groups
usually don't agree on anything.

03:47.542 --> 03:50.667
Uh, Jack? Jack!

03:50.750 --> 03:54.792
Oh... sorry.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.542
I was up all night playing Kung Fu Cop 77.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.792
You go back in time with Bobby
and play a bell-bottomed super freak.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.083
Last night, I took out eight ninjas
with one disco ball.

04:04.750 --> 04:08.750
Wait, so now you haven't slept
for two nights in a row?

04:08.834 --> 04:12.542
Ah, so what? Let's spar, Milton.

04:16.333 --> 04:19.125
Whoa!

04:20.834 --> 04:23.041
Holy Christmas nuts!

04:23.125 --> 04:26.625
I don't know what just happened,
but I think I just became a man!

04:26.709 --> 04:29.750
I've gotta call my father.

04:31.125 --> 04:34.375
Jack, go to my office, lie down,
and take a nap.

04:34.458 --> 04:37.000
Rudy, I'm fine. Tell him, Eddie.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.667
Oh, no, I'm Jerry. The good-looking one.

04:40.959 --> 04:43.208
Jack, I'm not gonna let you spar.
It'd be dangerous.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.959
I'm telling you, just go to my office.

04:45.041 --> 04:47.208
Rudy, you can't tell me what to do.

04:47.291 --> 04:51.667
I can in this dojo. I'm your sensei,
and I'm telling you to go lie down.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.875
Fine. But while I'm in there,

04:53.959 --> 04:56.458
I hope nothing happens
to your secret stash of cashews.

04:57.917 --> 04:59.792
How did you know
about my secret stash of--

04:59.875 --> 05:02.417
Oh, the cashews? Help yourself.

05:04.667 --> 05:09.500
Whoa, Kung Fu Cop 77!
It's the movie the game is based on.

05:10.333 --> 05:14.166
Wide awake, Rudy. Not taking a nap,
gonna watch a movie!

05:20.417 --> 05:21.542
Ah.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.458
<i>It was the summer of '77.</i>

05:25.542 --> 05:31.041
<i>A wave of crime swept the city
like a giant broom of... crime.</i>

05:31.125 --> 05:34.959
<i>The only thing that could save the city
was a kung fu cop</i>

05:35.041 --> 05:37.125
<i>and his new hard-headed rookie partner...</i>

05:40.333 --> 05:42.000
Get up, hairbag!

05:45.917 --> 05:48.250
- Eddie?
- It's Chief Eddie to you!

05:48.333 --> 05:51.041
If I wanted to stare
at a long-haired bucket of drool,

05:51.125 --> 05:53.208
I'd go home and wake up my wife!

05:55.375 --> 05:56.667
Now come with me.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.875
My number one kung fu cop
is waiting outside.

06:10.959 --> 06:14.166
It's time for him to meet
his new hard-headed rookie partner.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.500
- Why are you always shouting?
- It's the 70's, everything's loud!

06:20.417 --> 06:23.333
Look at your shirt. See that? Loud!

06:24.709 --> 06:26.166
There's Wasabi now.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.333
Bobby, this is your new partner.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.917
- This kid's my new partner?
- Yeah.

06:40.583 --> 06:43.125
I'm a butt-kicker not a baby sitter.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.667
I don't need a baby sitter, pops.

06:47.041 --> 06:50.667
Who you calling pops?
I'm old enough to be your father.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.083
Oh, I see. That actually makes sense.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.375
Now come on, punk,
you want a piece of this?

06:56.834 --> 06:58.125
Yeah, I do!

06:58.208 --> 07:01.542
Maybe it's time somebody put you
in your place! Whoo!

07:01.625 --> 07:03.458
- Let's dance.
- Come on.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.709
Whoa, whoa! Back off, both of you!

07:14.834 --> 07:17.458
This is a police dojo, not a disco.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.709
You two better figure out a way
to work together.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.166
I'm going to lunch.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.000
I said lunch!

07:26.583 --> 07:28.750
You just stay out of my way, rookie.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.375
You stay out of mine, old man.

07:32.709 --> 07:35.750
My name is Snowflake Jones,
and I've been robbed.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.250
Hello, uh, Snowflake.

07:41.583 --> 07:43.750
You've come to the right place,
I'll help you.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.667
My name's Jack. Check out my hair.

07:46.959 --> 07:50.208
Usually I don't trust the fuzz,
but I'm digging your vibe.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.667
Well, I hope you keep digging.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.458
'Cause under this vibe
is a layer of groove.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.208
Are you done, love train?

08:02.417 --> 08:06.166
I'll help this helpless kitten
who... lost her mitten.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.250
This kitten has claws. Hi-yah!

08:11.667 --> 08:13.333
So, how can we help you, ma'am?

08:14.417 --> 08:16.250
I can take care of myself, man.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.250
I don't need your jive time muscles,
I need your badges.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.166
Someone broke into my pad
and stole my dragon's eye necklace.

08:22.250 --> 08:26.834
Well, we dig.
What does your necklace look like, sister?

08:27.458 --> 08:30.792
Whoa, whoa, hold on, rookie.
Let me show you how it's done.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.125
What does your necklace look like, sister?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.250
Gold link chain, round pendant
with a dragon's eye in the middle.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.917
My aunt gave it to me, and said whoever
wears that necklace holds great power.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.542
A necklace like that falls into
the wrong hands, it would be a bad scene.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.458
One, it's owner could use it
to take over the world.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.667
Two, it may not go good with their outfit.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.792
-
- Both, Okay, we'll take the case!

08:56.875 --> 08:58.166
No, you won't!

08:58.750 --> 09:01.000
Come on, Chief! The Snowflake needs us.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.208
We can't let that dragon's eye get
into the wrong hands.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.625
I'm not sending you on a wild goose chase.

09:05.709 --> 09:08.166
Not when a wild goose
just busted out of the zoo

09:08.250 --> 09:09.583
and I need you to chase it.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.667
Just stay away
from that dragon's eye case,

09:13.750 --> 09:16.166
or it'll mean your badges.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.750
Oh, wow, this is good!

09:19.166 --> 09:22.125
I'll find the necklace myself.
I thought you two had nunchucks.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.667
Oh, we got nunchucks, sister.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.917
Look, I don't care
if our jobs are on the line.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.291
This stone cold fox needs our help.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.458
- We're in.
- Hold on, punk.

09:39.542 --> 09:42.709
I'm in charge here.
And we're not in unless I say we're in.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.208
We're in.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.375
Groovy, baby!

09:46.500 --> 09:49.083
Ah, if we're gonna fight crime,
we need some theme music.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.250
For once, you're right.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.250
Let me take a shot at this.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.458
Now that's a groove I can boogie to.

10:30.291 --> 10:34.000
This is the "Loose Lips Diner."
It's where all the snitches hang out.

10:34.792 --> 10:38.792
Yeah, I heard about this place.
They got a really far out secret sauce.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.041
It's just ketchup and mayonnaise,
with a hint of paprika.

10:44.834 --> 10:46.041
But you didn't hear it from me.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.083
-
- Oh!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.291
That's La Boca.

10:50.625 --> 10:54.375
If somebody took your dragon's eye
necklace, he'll know.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.417
I'll get this bird to sing.

10:57.083 --> 11:00.208
Come on, baby! Who's a good birdie?

11:00.291 --> 11:03.417
Get out of the way! La Boca.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.834
La Boca, I know you know
what I want to know,

11:12.917 --> 11:15.709
and I want you to know that I know it.
You know?

11:16.375 --> 11:17.417
No.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.166
-
- Okay, La Boca,

11:20.667 --> 11:24.458
you gonna play along or is my partner here
gonna have to throw the book at you?

11:24.917 --> 11:27.667
I didn't bring my throwing book.
I thought you were going to bring yours.

11:30.333 --> 11:34.959
Oh, what you doing, mami!

11:35.041 --> 11:38.291
Listen, sucker. If my dragon's eye
necklace falls into the wrong hands,

11:38.375 --> 11:40.959
the whole world could be in danger.
Can you dig it?

11:41.625 --> 11:45.458
Okay, okay. Let me down, muscle momma,
and I'll tell you what I know.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.250
- Shh!
- Shh!

11:52.333 --> 11:53.250
Shh!

11:54.208 --> 11:58.083
Okay, there's a hot new club downtown
called The School.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.792
Word on the street is someone has been
flashing your necklace around there.

12:00.875 --> 12:01.959
- Let's go.
- Wait!

12:03.667 --> 12:06.750
There's more.
Once I start snitching, I can't stop.

12:07.792 --> 12:10.166
You don't have to wait an hour
after you eat to go swimming.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.500
Oh, and the tooth fairy
is actually just your--

12:12.583 --> 12:14.125
La-la-la-la-la!

12:15.041 --> 12:18.250
Get in the car, La Boca!
We need you to take us to The School!

12:18.333 --> 12:21.500
Okay, okay. But I'm gonna try
and escape at the first stoplight.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.792
Dang! Why do I love snitching so much?

12:34.542 --> 12:37.375
Wow, this schoolhouse rocks!

12:37.458 --> 12:39.041
Who are all these cats here to see?

12:39.125 --> 12:42.709
The hero of the French horn,
Milty Moondust.

12:42.792 --> 12:46.000
He can blow notes that sound like
a walrus passing gas in a steel drum.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.458
My old lady makes the same sound

12:49.542 --> 12:51.750
when she bends over
to pick up the newspaper.

12:51.834 --> 12:57.000
- Today's headline, Clear the Room.
-

13:05.083 --> 13:11.291
Hello, earthlings!
I bring you an interstellar groove.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.375
Look around, Snowflake.
Do you see your necklace?

13:27.834 --> 13:31.542
There's a lot of fly neck candy.
But I don't see the Dragon's Eye anywhere.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.959
Hello?

13:40.750 --> 13:42.500
Trying to rock the house here.

13:42.583 --> 13:46.959
I don't come to your house and interrupt
you during your groovy French horn solos.

13:47.667 --> 13:51.667
Can it, space boy.
This is an important police investigation.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.625
We're looking
for the Dragon's Eye necklace.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.917
Oh, well in that case... the show's over.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.250
Rock and roll!

14:00.500 --> 14:02.208
Stupid, sexy shoes!

14:03.792 --> 14:04.834
Let's get him!

14:12.375 --> 14:15.291
- Aah!
-

14:15.375 --> 14:17.333
Okay, Milty, spill it!
What are you hiding?

14:17.417 --> 14:20.583
I can't hide anything. I'm in Spandex.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.458
- He won't talk.
- Won't he?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.583
Sure would be horrible
if something bad happened to your horn!

14:28.667 --> 14:31.000
-
- Fine, I'll talk.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.125
I saw a dude with your necklace.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.208
He asked me to play a private gig later
at his lava lamp factory.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.041
- If you know what's good for you--
- Oh, I do.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.250
Vitamin C, eight hours of sleep,
and leafy vegetables.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.000
Let me finish.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.166
If you know what's good for you,
you'll take us there.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.959
Oh, that? Yeah, sure. To my spaceship!

14:56.125 --> 14:58.458
And by "spaceship",
I mean my sister's bike.

15:02.834 --> 15:06.166
I gotta ask. Was your partner
really wasted by a French horn?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.041
It was actually a violin.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.166
But the French horn
was pulling the strings.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.792
Well, well, well.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.834
- Look what the cat dragged in.
-

15:26.917 --> 15:28.083
Chief Eddie?

15:28.166 --> 15:32.083
I told you two not to take this case.
But you didn't listen, did you?

15:32.166 --> 15:35.000
Chief? You're the evil mastermind?

15:35.083 --> 15:38.333
Chief's permanently off duty.
I got your necklace.

15:38.750 --> 15:42.667
You know why? 'Cause I'm a bad boy.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.834
Oh, you're bad all right.

15:45.917 --> 15:49.834
And I don't mean bad meaning good
like the kids have recently begun to say!

15:51.375 --> 15:54.834
This necklace gave me the power
to get everything I ever wanted,

15:55.375 --> 16:00.291
money, women, cars, and my falcon, Toto.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.875
Give it up, Eddie. It's a stuffed pigeon!

16:02.959 --> 16:04.041
-
- Ha?

16:06.667 --> 16:10.667
You've got something
that belongs to this foxy mama.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.458
You just made my mood ring turn red!

16:15.917 --> 16:19.125
Do you mind?
Battling an evil mastermind here!

16:20.625 --> 16:22.917
We want the Dragon's Eye
and we want it now!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You mean this?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.917
- I don't think so!
-

16:29.166 --> 16:31.291
Turquoise, Cocoa,

16:31.750 --> 16:34.375
you're about to see Big Daddy
take care of some business.

16:39.625 --> 16:43.917
- Wasabi!
-

16:47.125 --> 16:49.875
Would you stop playing?
They can't fight to that.

17:03.792 --> 17:04.750
Bobby!

17:34.500 --> 17:36.208
-
- Whoa!

17:38.750 --> 17:42.625
- Hi-yah!
-

17:42.709 --> 17:45.375
Snowflake,
you ever think of joining the force?

17:45.458 --> 17:46.709
It's not my bag, man.

17:46.792 --> 17:49.417
This is one chick that can't be caged.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.500
Not bad for a rookie.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.625
Pretty good for an old man.

18:01.291 --> 18:05.166
When you two are done playing patty-cake,
Eddie's getting away with my necklace!

18:12.250 --> 18:14.125
Give it up, Eddie! Hand over the necklace.

18:14.208 --> 18:17.333
If I can't have the Dragon's Eye,
no one can!

18:19.125 --> 18:21.750
Is it just me,
or is that thing falling really slow?

18:35.792 --> 18:39.041
Jack, it's too dangerous.
That pipe won't hold your weight.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.125
I know what I'm doing.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.041
Jack, I'm in charge,
and I order you off that pipe!

18:48.125 --> 18:50.125
No one tells me what to do!

18:57.500 --> 18:59.125
-
- Jack!

18:59.750 --> 19:03.000
Whoa!

19:03.083 --> 19:06.125
Oh, man. He's falling slow, too!

19:06.959 --> 19:12.875
I should have listened!

19:12.959 --> 19:14.500
I, I should have listened!

19:14.583 --> 19:16.875
- I should have listened!
- Jack, Jack! Wake up.

19:17.458 --> 19:21.959
I just had the craziest dream.

19:22.834 --> 19:26.792
You were there, and you were there,
and you were there.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.291
We all had really bad hair.

19:32.291 --> 19:35.917
Except for you, Kim.
Your hair looked kind of pretty.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.709
Uh, thanks. I guess.

19:42.625 --> 19:45.667
Whoa, that's weird.
My mood ring just turned red.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.542
- What?
- My aunt gave it to me with the necklace.

19:49.625 --> 19:53.208
- Where is your necklace?
- I lost it. She's gonna freak out.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.333
Jack, you feeling any better
now that you got some sleep?

19:56.875 --> 19:58.375
Yeah, you were right.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.250
I didn't mean to disrespect you.
I was just tired.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.458
It's cool.
I'm just glad you got a little rest.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.291
Kim, I found your necklace
over at Falafel Phil's.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.500
- Oh, thanks!
- And the weirdest thing,

20:09.583 --> 20:12.667
I just bumped into Stacy Weisman,
and she asked me out.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.250
Maybe Kim's necklace
does have magical powers.

20:16.709 --> 20:19.250
Come on, guys, it's just a necklace.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.750
It can't have magical powers, right?

20:24.709 --> 20:28.333
I'm gonna go home. I think I may need
some more sleep. See you, guys!

20:29.834 --> 20:31.041
Yeah, I'm out of here, too, guys.

20:31.458 --> 20:35.000
I'm gonna return Dr. Follicle's
rip-off Hair Grower.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.709
It's not working, huh?

20:36.792 --> 20:39.333
Oh, it's working. Everywhere but my face.

20:39.917 --> 20:42.709
Oh! Ew!
