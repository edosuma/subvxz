WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.381
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:02.430 --> 00:03.863
JASON: What, you're
staying here now?

00:03.910 --> 00:05.252
Yeah, you know, I just trying
to focus on the thing

00:05.300 --> 00:06.995
that matters most in my life,
being a Naw SEAL.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.177
My name is
Sergeant Miller.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.656
My mission is to turn you
into an officer.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.749
Something's wrong with you,
and I'm-a find out what it is.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.963
But what about the |oans?It's too late to apply.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.739
How could you miss the deadline?

00:19.800 --> 00:21.404
I've got my own life
and our life

00:21.450 --> 00:22.758
I have to keep running
when you're gone.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.848
You're drinking too much.
Ignoring the family.

00:24.890 --> 00:26.403
This isn't the man
I married.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.803
This is the broken
sailor I found.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.489
I don't want that man to come
home from the Philippines.

00:31.550 --> 00:32.448
DAVIS:
I'm gonna miss this.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.501
12 weeks without your barbecue.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.279
That's not the only thing
you're gonna miss.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.819
[laughs]

00:37.860 --> 00:39.339
Hey, Zell, what's up?How you doing, man?

00:39.380 --> 00:40.768
Hey.
Good to see you.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.037
So you're still in,
you're still grinding?

00:42.080 --> 00:43.422
Yeah, you know, pays the bills.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.688
Not as much as that should,
though, am I right?

00:45.740 --> 00:48.038
JASON: Hey, where's
your radio?On the hill,

00:48.090 --> 00:49.819
so the PLA track away from us.
Should buy us a few minutes.

00:49.870 --> 00:51.087
ERIC:
Spoke to PACOM command.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.303
They're not exactly thrilled
that our boy Clay

00:53.350 --> 00:55.045
left an encrypted
communication device

00:55.090 --> 00:56.398
in the hands
of the Chinese.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.489
We need command to be happy
with us or our lives

00:59.530 --> 01:01.179
are gonna become
extremely unpleasant.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.408
[barking]

01:11.240 --> 01:14.585
Come on right now.

01:14.630 --> 01:17.281
[all panting]Sweet Lord of the Rings.

01:17.330 --> 01:21.369
Okay. That's it.
That's enough for today, boys.

01:21.420 --> 01:24.162
Ah, it was enough two hours ago.

01:24.210 --> 01:27.122
We brought something
to share, to thank you

01:27.170 --> 01:30.037
for everything you've shared
with us these past few weeks.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.218
OTHERS: Oh!JASON: What is that?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.648
Snake wine.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.214
That is one big ass
tequila worm.

01:37.270 --> 01:40.046
Even in death, the cobra's
poised for battle.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.260
To Bravo Team.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.358
[speaking Tagalog]Cheers.
Yeah, yeah.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.617
Are you nuts?

01:44.660 --> 01:46.139
You're gonna drink that?

01:46.190 --> 01:48.146
The venom's harmless.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.669
Almost always.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.052
[laughter][speaking Tagalog]

01:51.110 --> 01:53.192
[speaking Tagalog]
Clay!

01:53.240 --> 01:56.289
All right, all right,
I'll do one, I'll do one.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.843
[cheering]
No, no, no, no.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.197
Slow your roll there, 6,
you're a baby.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.151
You're low on tough.RAY: You gonna be sick.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.155
[laughing]:
You gonna get sick.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.156
[laughter]

02:04.210 --> 02:05.723
[speaking Tagalog]

02:05.770 --> 02:07.465
I'm gonna show you
how Texas drinks

02:07.510 --> 02:10.126
some Filipino snake venom.
That's right.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.252
[speaking Tagalog]Mmm.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.734
Yeah.That's easy.

02:14.780 --> 02:17.169
[9695]

02:17.220 --> 02:18.209
[laughter]

02:18.260 --> 02:19.909
Yup, there it is.[coughing]

02:19.960 --> 02:21.302
All right.
Clay, you're up.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.001
RAY: Oh, Jay, come on,
man, not the hat.

02:24.050 --> 02:26.655
Come on, let's go.Just went from bad to worse.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.314
[cheering]

02:28.360 --> 02:30.271
There it is.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.278
JASON:
The snake venom! [hissing][speaking Tagalog]

02:33.320 --> 02:35.276
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

02:37.020 --> 02:38.271
[Clay coughs]

02:45.380 --> 02:47.371
ERIC:
Gentlemen.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.593
This is Unit 3
Commander Shaw.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.813
He, along with our friends
at NAVSOG Command,

02:51.860 --> 02:54.511
wanted to get a glimpse of the
intensive and targeted training

02:54.560 --> 02:56.073
that Bravo Team
IS conducting,

02:56.130 --> 02:59.167
along with our
partner forces.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.558
Yeah, right, we were
just, uh, you know,

03:02.610 --> 03:03.861
having a little fun,
that's all.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.956
So if we'd come by earlier,

03:06.010 --> 03:08.137
you would've resembled
Tier One professionals.

03:10.660 --> 03:11.922
[Sonny continues vomiting]

03:11.970 --> 03:13.005
[coughing]

03:13.060 --> 03:15.927
I'm sorry, sir.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.188
Did not get any on
your boots, you're good.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.105
It's unfortunate
tImIng, Sllâ€˜.

03:24.630 --> 03:27.895
I'm sure they're all very eager
to get back to work.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.286
[quietly]:
Yeah.

03:43.260 --> 03:45.308
Who the hell is this guy?
Regional Commander Shaw--

03:45.350 --> 03:47.398
from what I'm hearing,
this guy can't even operate

03:47.440 --> 03:48.782
out of a wet
paper bag.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.138
Jason, take a breath, all right.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.431
You're not the one

03:51.490 --> 03:53.173
who just had
an hour-long earful.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.788
What's his problem with you?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.741
Commander Shaw takes issue
with the Bravo Team culture.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.698
What's that mean?

03:58.760 --> 03:59.886
Well, to start with,

03:59.930 --> 04:01.010
he wants us to look
more professronal.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.846
[laughs]Haircuts, uniforms.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.677
It's a joke, right? We're
out there busting our asses

04:05.720 --> 04:07.449
and he's more _concerned
about our fashion sense?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.934
It's not about
fashion sense.What's it about?

04:09.980 --> 04:12.323
It's_about Mexico
gorng srdeways.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.540
Really, Mexico again?

04:13.600 --> 04:16.160
It's about not taking out Zaman.

04:16.210 --> 04:18.075
It's about Clay pulling
the stunt with the radio.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.329
Commander Shaw believes
that a lax culture

04:22.390 --> 04:24.290
has contributed
to operational missteps.

04:24.350 --> 04:26.295
Yeah, well, he's wrong.Yeah, well,
he's also senior rank,

04:26.350 --> 04:27.430
so wrong doesn't matter.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.913
You gotta be kidding me.
Any other unit

04:28.960 --> 04:30.393
does those operations,
there's not gonna be missteps,

04:30.440 --> 04:31.998
there's gonna be casualties,
a lot of them.
Jason!

04:32.050 --> 04:33.870
It doesn't matter, Jason.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.002
If Commander Shaw

04:36.050 --> 04:38.132
wants things in Bravo to change,
then guess what?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.259
They'll change.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.574
Sure. Start with our uniforms.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.890
What's our move, Davis?

05:00.950 --> 05:03.339
It's simple. They're patrolling
in predictable patterns.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.460
The entry point's exposed every
11 seconds, yes, but it's not...

05:05.520 --> 05:07.476
We have plenty of time
to rush in and grab the flag.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.475
[sighs]

05:08.520 --> 05:11.307
We're not doing that.

05:11.350 --> 05:13.659
What, you're not
fast enough?

05:13.700 --> 05:15.474
They're not dumb enough.

05:15.530 --> 05:17.748
If they're moving in a
predictable way, it's a trap.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.917
You got
a better idea?

05:19.970 --> 05:21.961
Yes, Evelyn, I do.

05:22.010 --> 05:24.319
Watts.
Yeah.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.225
How'd you like
a battlefield promotion?

05:31.720 --> 05:33.711
[helicopter whirring]

05:40.550 --> 05:42.108
MAN: Okay, move,
move, move, move.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.980
WOMAN:
Go, go, go. Go.

05:44.030 --> 05:45.941
Get on your feet.
This exercise is over.

05:45.990 --> 05:48.811
Meyer, Shocky, put them
in the Humvee.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.167
Rogen
Will do.

06:09.190 --> 06:10.885
WA'I'I'S:
Got it!

06:10.930 --> 06:12.147
Oh...

06:12.190 --> 06:14.010
[cheering]

06:14.060 --> 06:15.709
EVELYN:
Nice work, Davis.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.068
Davis, you killed it.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.327
Nice work.

06:18.370 --> 06:21.282
MILLER:
Get in formation!

06:21.330 --> 06:25.152
Impersonating
an instructor.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.075
Was that your
bright idea, Watts?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.371
It was mine, Gunnery Sergeant.

06:30.860 --> 06:33.602
You proud of
yourself, Davis?

06:33.650 --> 06:36.904
Cheating your way
through the mission?

06:36.960 --> 06:40.475
We won, Gunnery Sergeant.

06:42.790 --> 06:45.350
We'll see.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.966
RAY:
Oh, oh, Sonny,

06:54.020 --> 06:56.011
you got yourself about
a bottle-a-day habit

06:56.060 --> 06:57.186
there with that sauce,

06:57.240 --> 06:58.275
you trying to marinate
yourself with that?

06:58.330 --> 06:59.752
All this running around
we're doing,

06:59.810 --> 07:02.370
I need something
to keep the calories up

07:02.420 --> 07:04.149
so my pants don't fall down.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.064
You know, that's about
all we've been doing

07:05.120 --> 07:06.280
is running in circles, man.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.888
We might as well deploy
to a summer camp.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.079
We get it.
We understand, all right?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.371
Poster Boy here, he's itching

07:11.430 --> 07:12.943
for a little action,
just a little mish.

07:12.990 --> 07:15.424
Kid Vicious, why don't you
get yourself a roll of quarters,

07:15.470 --> 07:16.812
head down
to the arcade,

07:16.870 --> 07:18.952
and blast some Space Invaders?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.788
[laughter]Okay. Sonny, you know,
it was really nice

07:22.830 --> 07:25.526
of you to support the local
culture and buy that shirt here.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.697
[laughter]

07:27.750 --> 07:29.138
The real question here
that everybody's asking

07:29.180 --> 07:30.613
is why you seem so content.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.480
Dude, we've been here
for three weeks

07:32.530 --> 07:34.225
sitting on our asses, and you're
not climbing the ceilings.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.487
What's going on, buddy?

07:35.540 --> 07:38.054
Well, man, I am the don
of the Philippines.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.977
Okay?
I enjoy the Gucci missions.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.180
Basking in the glow

07:41.240 --> 07:42.844
of the red-light district'd be
my guess.

07:42.890 --> 07:45.063
He hasn't invited me
to any late night outings.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.327
Any of you?

07:46.370 --> 07:47.849
Nope.JASON: I think he's
sneaking around

07:47.900 --> 07:49.026
these little dirty alleys.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.503
[laughter]

07:50.550 --> 07:52.074
And he's a little
too embarrassed

07:52.120 --> 07:53.599
to bring a wingman, right?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.722
Either that_ or he's sweet
on a particular dancer,

07:55.770 --> 07:57.510
and he wants to keep her
all to himself.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.515
RAY:
That it, Sonny?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.039
You got a special girl?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.900
They all have
a special place

08:01.950 --> 08:04.475
inside Sonny Quinn's big heart.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.078
No, no, no, no, that's a dodge.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.381
You're lying, man.Sonny, she got a name?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.782
I mean, this girl?

08:08.830 --> 08:10.081
Do y'all know that Blackburn's

08:10.140 --> 08:11.391
been counting cards
every time?

08:11.440 --> 08:13.351
Counting the lies
at this table.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.526
Yeah! Yeah!

08:14.580 --> 08:16.093
I want to get my money back!

08:16.140 --> 08:17.539
Sonny, what's-what's
her name, man?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.877
Hold on, what's
her name, buddy?

08:18.930 --> 08:21.535
Blackburn.
Yeah, I ain't
counting cards.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.059
I'm out.
I'm out.

08:23.110 --> 08:24.919
I got to run an errand, fellas.

08:24.980 --> 08:26.402
[groans]

08:26.460 --> 08:28.928
Okay, it looks like it's
between me and Poster Boy here.

08:32.810 --> 08:36.109
I'll tell you what, make it
a little bit more interesting,

08:36.160 --> 08:37.593
I'll throw in a 20.0THERS: Ooh!

08:37.640 --> 08:38.766
The boss man.
Big money.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.071
SONNY:
Come on.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.254
All right, I'll, uh...RAY: Don't do it.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.259
I'm gonna,
I'll-I'll-I'll call you and...

08:47.300 --> 08:52.135
widen another hundo.OTHERS: Oh!

08:52.180 --> 08:54.876
Spenser, the man is about
to drop a quarter mil

08:54.920 --> 08:57.707
on Emma's education, you got to
leave him with a couple pennies.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.830
All I hear are gnats talking.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.097
I appreciate your help
right now, Ray,

09:00.140 --> 09:01.186
but let me deal
with this.

09:01.230 --> 09:03.186
He's bluffing, okay? Spank him.

09:03.230 --> 09:07.018
Let's go,
let's do it right now.

09:11.460 --> 09:11.937
I'm out.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.414
Aw! Come on!

09:14.460 --> 09:16.542
JASON: What do you have?Wasn't a bluff, man, I got...

09:16.590 --> 09:17.807
Aces and eights.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.418
SONNY:
Aw.

09:19.470 --> 09:22.428
Right there. Guys, time out,
that is bad juju right there.

09:22.470 --> 09:24.597
It's called the dead man's hand.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.777
It's what Wild Bill had the
night that he got schwacked.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.378
So what I'm saying is,

09:28.430 --> 09:29.772
Clay,

09:29.830 --> 09:32.219
[laughing]: you best stay away
from me right now.

09:32.260 --> 09:35.218
You know what? If my bad luck
brings a couple of gunfighters,

09:35.270 --> 09:36.476
I'm good with it.

09:36.530 --> 09:39.090
All right, all right.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.220
[groans] It's about time
for Naima to get up.

09:40.270 --> 09:42.090
I'm gonna take a walk,
give her a call.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.927
SONNY: Ooh, this is real
money right here, boys,

09:44.970 --> 09:47.621
How much
you clean up?
[chuckles]

09:47.670 --> 09:49.661
[country music playing]

09:55.370 --> 09:57.099
[sighs]

10:14.740 --> 10:17.561
Back home, I can't
stand country music,

10:17.610 --> 10:19.658
but put it
9,000 miles away,

10:19.700 --> 10:22.521
and all of a sudden, it's...

10:22.570 --> 10:24.174
Kind of beautiful.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.482
You with
the Services?

10:28.540 --> 10:30.349
Navy. You?

10:30.410 --> 10:33.880
Air Force. C_-20
support servnces,

10:33.930 --> 10:36.717
glorified drink
cart pushers.

10:36.760 --> 10:41.060
Only excitement I had all week
was the other night, right here.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.714
That right?

10:42.770 --> 10:43.930
I saw

10:43.990 --> 10:46.151
the most interesting-looking man
walk in,

10:46.210 --> 10:48.678
sit and drink alone.

10:48.730 --> 10:51.039
SEAL, I bet.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.868
Was gonna introduce myself,
but...

10:54.910 --> 10:56.901
he looked like he
had a lot on his mind.

10:58.740 --> 11:02.437
How did I lose you?

11:02.480 --> 11:04.744
_ WATTS: _
DaVIs, you're a genius.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.439
I'm calling my spot
in your squad.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.969
We're gonna kick
the Crucible's ass.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.443
Crucible?

11:09.490 --> 11:11.003
Shipboard firefighting.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.834
Heard it gets about
200 degrees in there.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.962
Intense, huh?

11:15.020 --> 11:17.181
What's wrong, Davis?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.662
Afraid of a little fire?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.676
[chanting in distance]

11:30.420 --> 11:31.853
[soft chatter over recording]

11:31.900 --> 11:33.720
[knocking on door]

11:33.780 --> 11:36.510
Take it 14 hours straight didn't
quench your appetite for work.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.471
Well, when you're
tracking the wicked,

11:38.520 --> 11:41.341
the whole bit about
"no rest" really holds true.

11:41.390 --> 11:44.860
Well, I figured you didn't eat.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.876
Took a guess.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.309
Cheeseburger and fries good?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.873
You are a god, Blackburn.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.969
Yeah, well, I'll remind you
of that one of these days.

11:54.010 --> 11:55.796
[laughs]

11:55.840 --> 11:58.092
So, any particular wickedness

11:58.150 --> 12:01.495
clouding the horizon
here in paradise?

12:01.540 --> 12:05.192
Rising chatter about the Moro
Liberation Front's activities.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.367
The usual churn
of piracy and trafficking,

12:07.420 --> 12:09.581
but nothing actionable yet.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.676
Copy that. Well,

12:11.730 --> 12:15.848
you, uh, need the world's finest
assault team for dessert,

12:15.900 --> 12:18.687
just give us a call.

12:18.730 --> 12:22.643
I was just, was angry,
I was violent.

12:22.690 --> 12:27.730
I lost my dad, and, um, I wanted
to fight the whole world.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.179
But enlisting,
making the teams,

12:30.220 --> 12:32.825
I mean, it helped me turn
all that anger, all that fight

12:32.880 --> 12:36.782
into something powerful,
something useful.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.876
LegaL

12:38.930 --> 12:41.626
I mean, I stayed
angry for a while,

12:41.670 --> 12:43.490
but all of a sudden,
I had a life.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.053
You know? A church, a home.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.668
People counting on me.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.847
Like your team.My team,

12:48.890 --> 12:50.494
my wife, my family.

12:50.550 --> 12:53.371
I became very,
very good

12:53.420 --> 12:55.115
at living up to expectations.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.116
Of being who
they needed me to be.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.209
But that's not
who you really are?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.683
It's the role I've been playing.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.290
Clothes I've
been wearing

13:04.340 --> 13:06.683
and scripture I've been quoting.

13:06.740 --> 13:07.900
But...

13:07.960 --> 13:11.214
There's someone behind all that.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.478
The real you.

13:13.530 --> 13:15.691
Or maybe there is no real me.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.742
I mean, maybe I'm just
going through the motions

13:18.790 --> 13:21.839
and there's nothing
behind any of it.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.882
Mm, I don't know about that.

13:23.930 --> 13:27.229
I mean, a guy like you?

13:29.980 --> 13:32.585
[chuckles]
Not enough whiskey in this bar

13:32.630 --> 13:34.359
to get us started on faith.

13:34.420 --> 13:37.150
What do you mean?

13:37.200 --> 13:39.282
You spend so much time

13:39.340 --> 13:41.410
looking at the world through
faith that you just let it blur

13:41.470 --> 13:45.463
some ugly things you should've
been seeing the whole time.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.296
Or maybe you're
thinking too much.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.296
[both laugh]Okay.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.477
You got, you got jokes.
You're funny.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.044
All I can say is,
for my life,

13:54.090 --> 13:56.081
it's automatic.

13:56.130 --> 13:58.348
There's not a whole lot
of thinking involved.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.914
Constant motion means
I am not tied down

14:00.970 --> 14:02.915
with anyone's expectations.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.313
I'm not living for anyone else.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.885
That's a neat trick, Christine.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.400
Well, it allows me
to be whoever I want to be.

14:11.450 --> 14:16.888
To do whatever I want,
with or without whoever I want.

14:26.030 --> 14:26.985
Hey.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.110
Yo.

14:30.210 --> 14:32.599
Hey, Ray...

14:32.650 --> 14:33.867
[papers thud]

14:33.910 --> 14:35.992
...everything okay at home?

14:36.040 --> 14:37.860
What do you mean?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.342
Well, last night,

14:39.400 --> 14:41.470
you were still gone
when I racked out.

14:41.530 --> 14:43.134
Yeah?

14:43.180 --> 14:46.047
Three hour phone call with,
uh, Naima, I just wondered...

14:46.100 --> 14:47.965
What?

14:48.010 --> 14:51.571
You worried about
my roamIng fees?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.019
[door opens]

14:53.060 --> 14:55.881
[indistinct chatter]

14:55.930 --> 14:58.751
Nah. We're good.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.100
He's buttoning...

15:03.160 --> 15:06.027
[laughs]: He's bent over,
inspecting something.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.118
I was like,
"What are you doing?"

15:08.160 --> 15:09.422
RAY:
Settle in.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.293
A ten-story monster
of steel, veins pumping

15:14.340 --> 15:17.252
with pressurized explosive fuel,

15:17.300 --> 15:20.565
just waiting for a stray bullet
to set it off.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.912
A gas and oil platform.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.520
And with the regional surge
in GOPLAT construction,

15:26.570 --> 15:27.821
you will eventually
be called upon

15:27.880 --> 15:29.006
to recover
one of these bad boys.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.267
That's right.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.969
And luckily for you boys,

15:32.010 --> 15:35.480
we did a successful GOPLAT
takedown last year.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.053
So what we are gonna do
is we're just gonna

15:37.110 --> 15:38.975
run these through a couple
of the operational procedures.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.271
SONNY:
And also, where
to get the best

15:40.330 --> 15:41.661
shark-deterrent accessories.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.756
Not how to swan dive
from 70 feet high.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.584
Ain't that right? Mm-hmm.70 feet high?

15:45.640 --> 15:46.709
It was at least 90 feet.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.328
SONNY:
It was 55.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.280
The whole thing was in flames.RAY: Children. Children!

15:52.210 --> 15:53.461
Can we focus, please?

15:53.510 --> 15:54.761
We got the classroom,
and then we got outside.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.436
Please turn to page three.
That's where we'll go over

16:03.480 --> 16:05.732
the multipoint infil
that we like to use

16:05.790 --> 16:07.303
when we hit a GOPLAT.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.354
MILLER: You will continue
down the corridor,

16:11.400 --> 16:14.005
extinguishing all flames
you encounter,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.574
executing a||
preventative procedures

16:16.620 --> 16:20.363
so that the fire
does not spread.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.401
[filtered breathing]

16:37.900 --> 16:39.242
You ready, Davis?

16:49.830 --> 16:51.821
DAVIS:
On my movement.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.871
Close the damper on the left.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.919
MAN:
Damper closed.

16:56.970 --> 16:58.961
DAVIS:
Each clear, moving forward.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.571
Approaching engine room.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.236
[metal creaking]

17:07.280 --> 17:09.931
MAN:
Hey, hey! [shouting]

17:09.980 --> 17:12.289
DAVIS:
Moving forward.

17:15.510 --> 17:17.546
MAN:
Clear, clear! Clear!

17:22.340 --> 17:24.331
DAVIS:
There.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.132
Nozzle.

17:38.230 --> 17:40.039
[girl's voice echoing]

17:54.810 --> 17:56.027
MAN:
DaVIs!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.772
[Tagalog pop song playing]

18:08.820 --> 18:11.812
After action review?

18:11.870 --> 18:13.565
Doesn't that normally
follow action?

18:13.610 --> 18:15.646
Yeah, it usually does, but
you know what? Hey, Shaw.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.213
All right? He wants
these filled out now

18:17.270 --> 18:18.828
after every training session.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.781
"What were the obstacles?
What were our challenges?

18:21.830 --> 18:24.355
What did we have to overcome?"
You know-- come on, seriously?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.868
I'd rather have a
coffee enema In Mosul.

18:26.930 --> 18:30.058
Why don't you kick
this waste of time

18:30.100 --> 18:32.568
down to, like, Clay or-or Brock?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.845
'Cause then you'd be admitting
you're taking Shaw seriously.

18:37.890 --> 18:41.189
Listen, all right? This guy can
make things a lot worse for us.

18:41.250 --> 18:45.027
I don't want anything changing
for Bravo Team, got it?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.765
So you play good soldier for
a little while and he backs off.Right.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.333
I don't know if it's gonna
be that easy-- you know what?

18:49.380 --> 18:50.984
These pigeon sticks
are really smelling.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.031
You're taking my food, man,
I paid good money...

18:53.080 --> 18:55.082
Not taking it, I'm putting
it somewhere else, Ray.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.218
You know that we're in trouble
if we eat street meat,
what might happen.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.909
Sonny, I've seen you eat a lot
weirder things than this.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.473
[laughs]
[laughs]

19:02.530 --> 19:04.691
We got those, uh,
ladder races tomorrow.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.139
Hmm? You're looking
pretty confident.Yeah?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.319
Want to place a little wager
against, uh, against me?

19:09.360 --> 19:11.146
Sonny, I'm not gonna, I'm
not gonna take any more

19:11.190 --> 19:13.010
of your money, dude.
I'm not doing it.

19:13.060 --> 19:16.234
Oh, come on, please, the-the
Quinns are legendary climbers.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.750
We were the first to adopt the,
uh, opposable thumb deal...

19:19.810 --> 19:21.801
Oh, here we go again.I bet you didn't know that.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.670
I'm not gonna take any more
of your frickin' money, dude.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.768
We're not doing it,
buddy. You're off.

19:25.810 --> 19:27.892
I'm off?It wouldn't be fair. Yeah.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.339
What the hell are you talking
about, I'm off?You're off.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.245
I'm never off. I'm always on.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.860
I don't know, man,
there's something...

19:33.910 --> 19:35.332
Maybe that stripper
girlfriend of yours,

19:35.390 --> 19:37.119
she got you a little...

19:37.170 --> 19:39.604
She put some sort of voodoo
curse on you or something.

19:39.650 --> 19:41.379
[laughs]

19:41.440 --> 19:43.214
Yeah.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.399
Mm, she ain't got
no voodoo on me.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.000
There isa she, you're gonna
admit there's a she?

19:51.920 --> 19:54.878
Sonny.

19:55.970 --> 19:58.052
Hey, look, Clay,

19:58.100 --> 20:00.625
it's a lot more
complicated than it seems.

20:00.670 --> 20:04.583
She got a big heart
and she got real big dreams

20:04.630 --> 20:08.418
and last thing I want to do
is compromise that.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.988
This is getting weird.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.851
I'm just saying, I feel like
I'm talking to my therapist

20:14.900 --> 20:17.334
[laughs]: or something.Oh, get the hell
out of here, dude.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.857
Look at me.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.946
Here we go,
all Mr. Feels over here.Hey.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.992
The second that
them bullets are flying,

20:24.040 --> 20:27.168
you'd best believe that Sonny
Quinn's gonna crush some skulls.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.656
Yeah, I never had a doubt, man.
Come on.
Yeah? Oh.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.179
MARK:
Come on, no. Jay, Jay,
don't get me wrong.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.915
The big blue machine
serves its purpose.Okay.

20:34.970 --> 20:36.870
Right, a decent soldier
puts in 20,

20:36.930 --> 20:38.488
gets his, gets his pension...Yeah.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.792
...the pride of service
and a few good stories, right?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.798
Mm.But what about
a guy like you?

20:43.850 --> 20:46.717
Come on. Exceptional performers
deserve more.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.409
I assume it would be
on the record if--

20:48.460 --> 20:50.360
You saying that I was,
what, exceptional?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.069
Don't ask me to spell it.That's what
Ithought

20:52.120 --> 20:53.633
I mean, like, this
whole TED Talk, it's great,

20:53.680 --> 20:55.591
I'm sure it's landed you a lot
of operators, but why me?

20:55.640 --> 20:58.859
I got a whole stable of
thoroughbreds from every branch.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.255
And when it comes
to Simple security ops,

21:01.300 --> 21:02.813
yeah, they crush it every time.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.997
But my business
is growing, Jay.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.291
I need leaders.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.126
Alphas who enter a room
and leave no doubt

21:09.180 --> 21:10.306
who's calling the shots.

21:12.350 --> 21:14.523
Navy's the only job
I've ever known.

21:14.570 --> 21:15.969
That's it.

21:16.010 --> 21:17.966
Right.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.614
Yeah.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.218
So, tell me.
How much does it cost?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.089
I'm sorry?

21:23.150 --> 21:25.789
The school your daughter
wants to attend,

21:25.840 --> 21:28.627
what's the tuition?

21:28.670 --> 21:31.138
Well, look.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.758
Tuition, we're looking...

21:32.810 --> 21:35.199
upwards of $50,000,
$60,000, maybe.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.024
That's not to
mention, you know,

21:37.070 --> 21:39.334
living in the city,
so, it gets up.

21:41.820 --> 21:44.243
You could make that
in about two months.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.333
Pick and choose
your aSSIgnments,

21:47.390 --> 21:48.903
work the way that works for you,

21:48.950 --> 21:50.906
spend more time
with your family.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.211
No more "good idea" fairies,

21:52.260 --> 21:54.251
no more command headaches.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.399
Asking me to leave the team.
[clears throat]

21:59.440 --> 22:00.919
I don't know if I can do that.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.961
Your team knows how much
you've given.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.756
Now it's time for you
to get something in return.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.145
[man muttering]

22:15.200 --> 22:17.191
[man shushes]

22:20.200 --> 22:22.065
MILLER:
Wake up, snowflake.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.378
What happened?

22:27.430 --> 22:29.250
You panicked.

22:30.690 --> 22:31.998
Rest of you, back
to the barracks.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.382
Enough drama
for today.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.783
Get yourself
straight, Davis.

22:54.850 --> 22:56.841
[man singing in Tagalog]

22:59.070 --> 23:01.152
[men laughing, chattering]

23:05.070 --> 23:06.947
[overlapping chatter]

23:06.990 --> 23:10.039
[jeers][laughter, chatter]

23:11.080 --> 23:12.900
Losing your touch
there, Hayes.

23:12.950 --> 23:15.077
Snuck up on you.[chuckles] No,
no, I saw you.

23:15.130 --> 23:17.121
You're a liar.
Gin and tonic, please.
Uh-huh.

23:17.170 --> 23:18.990
Gin and tonics,
coming in, all right.[clears throat]

23:19.040 --> 23:20.655
Good to see that
you're taking a break.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.179
Yeah, well.

23:22.220 --> 23:24.176
You know, I thought
unplugging for a minute

23:24.220 --> 23:26.916
would be
a nice distraction...

23:26.970 --> 23:28.653
But?

23:28.710 --> 23:29.961
[sighs]
I just remembered

23:30.010 --> 23:31.796
I turned 25
in this dump.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.148
25? Wow.
Mm-hmm.

23:33.190 --> 23:35.317
That is quite a long
time ago. Cheers to that.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.759
Smart ass.
[laughs]

23:37.800 --> 23:39.529
[scoffs]

23:39.590 --> 23:42.150
Point is,
I'm wondering

23:42.200 --> 23:43.713
if I'm cursed

23:43.770 --> 23:47.069
to an endless cycle
of anti-Western chatter

23:47.120 --> 23:49.987
and faux-Western decor
for the rest of my life.

23:50.030 --> 23:51.588
Right, right.
I get it.
Right?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.335
I get it, 'cause I've
been through this place

23:53.380 --> 23:56.122
more than once,
I'll tell you that.

23:58.210 --> 24:00.428
You ever think_about
when to give it up?

24:02.650 --> 24:04.606
No.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.914
There's always gonna
be another mission.

24:10.010 --> 24:12.046
[inhales sharply]

24:12.100 --> 24:14.443
Don't they all kind of start
blurring together for you?

24:16.750 --> 24:18.092
Not about the mission.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.499
This... our,
my country.

24:22.540 --> 24:23.848
The team.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.450
I got a lot more to do.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.025
What about you?

24:29.070 --> 24:31.413
You're thinking about
walking away, huh?

24:31.470 --> 24:34.280
[scoffs]
No.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.298
I never walk away.

24:37.340 --> 24:40.036
You know, we were here that time

24:40.080 --> 24:41.866
talking about Emma's future

24:41.910 --> 24:44.902
and your home and how
complicated it all is.[groans]

24:44.960 --> 24:47.656
[softly]:
Yeah.In my life, I don't have

24:47.700 --> 24:49.952
that kind of complicated.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.001
[men laughing]

24:53.140 --> 24:55.096
At some point...

24:55.140 --> 24:56.528
I might want it.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.003
What do you mean? Family?

24:59.060 --> 25:01.790
All right, I'm-- [laughs]What?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.751
You said it.Maybe not, like,

25:03.800 --> 25:06.325
full white picket fence, okay?No, no.

25:06.370 --> 25:09.191
But, just... a little less...

25:09.240 --> 25:11.845
jetlagged pursuit of evil.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.111

MILLER:
Get on your feet.

25:30.610 --> 25:32.953
You afraid of fire, Davis?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.742
Who isn't?
Uh... Gunnery Sergeant.

25:35.790 --> 25:39.009
Different for you, though.
Froze you.

25:39.050 --> 25:41.052
I inhaled smoke.

25:45.150 --> 25:47.971
I spoke with the infirmary,
they said you were clear.

25:48.020 --> 25:50.750
You will be expected
at this afternoon's PT.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.062
Is that a problem?

25:54.550 --> 25:56.586
'Cause if it is, you can DOR.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.036
CLAY:
Yeah, it is.Al| right.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.569
Coming in. Look at that.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.601
[men cheer]Jay with the reinforcements.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.083
Thank you.
Hey.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.131
SONNY: Jay,
I love you. [laughs]

26:19.180 --> 26:21.910
You, uh, you talk to Blackburn
about ol' Commander Buzzkill?

26:21.970 --> 26:24.484
Yeah, it felt like a spanking
from the principal was coming.

26:24.530 --> 26:26.316
I talked to him,
I set him straight.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.090
Told him, as long as I'm there,
Bravo team will always remain

26:29.150 --> 26:32.108
Bravo team.SONNY:
Amen to that. [whoops]

26:32.150 --> 26:34.402
Hey, let's go, boys.
SONNY:
Cheers on that alcohol, there.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.360
Doesn't have any of of them
floaty snake things

26:36.420 --> 26:39.503
that'll make you gag.
[cackles]
Mm.

Without you, man.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.223
I'm gonna hit the head.

getting all buzzy?

27:09.060 --> 27:10.664
Yeah, yeah.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.666
Got this angry Airbnb tenant

27:12.710 --> 27:14.792
blowing my phone up right now.
I need to go handle it.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.056
Right, I'm sure
they got terrified

27:16.110 --> 27:18.010
of what's in your little
"forbidden closet."

27:18.070 --> 27:20.630
[laughter]

27:20.680 --> 27:21.840
Hey. [chuckles]

27:21.900 --> 27:23.800
Hey. _
How you d0ing?

27:23.850 --> 27:26.193
Good, good.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.024
I saw you with
your friends.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.119
Was gonna come and say hi,
but I didn't want to interrupt.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.900
Oh. Yeah. I-I,
look, I was, um,

27:34.950 --> 27:37.032
I was gonna tell you
I had a-a real good time

27:37.090 --> 27:39.957
the other night
with you, talking.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.300
Actually, the best
I've felt in a while.

27:44.350 --> 27:46.136
Why is it easier to talk
to a stranger sometimes

27:46.180 --> 27:47.693
than it is the people you know?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.877
Well, you know, no stakes.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.706
Can't disappoint a stranger.

27:51.750 --> 27:55.880
Um, we could
keep talking.
[chuckles]

27:55.930 --> 27:58.148
I would...
The guys, um,

27:58.190 --> 28:00.750
they can be a bit much
if you're not used to them.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.543
Oh. Well, we could go
someplace else then,

28:04.590 --> 28:08.629
you know,
just to... talk.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.708
[line ringing]

28:31.750 --> 28:34.059
DAVIS [on phone]:
Hey.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.965
Hey. [chuckles]

28:36.010 --> 28:37.614
How are you?

28:37.670 --> 28:41.879
Sorry, uh, sorry I didn't
catch you yesterday.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.148
Anything new?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.009
Not really.

28:46.070 --> 28:49.289
Davis, you okay? You sound, uh,

28:49.330 --> 28:51.412
you sound a little down.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.021
I'm fine.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.297
Oh, yeah?

28:57.340 --> 28:59.729
What's going on?

29:02.300 --> 29:04.689
So what about Swanny?
You talk to him?

29:04.740 --> 29:07.777
Yeah, yeah, I talked to him.
He's good, man. He's just, uh...

29:07.830 --> 29:09.866
Swanny?Apparently he fixed
this plumbing issue

29:09.920 --> 29:12.388
I had in my apartment now for
the past year, so that's good.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.305
Yeah, I'm sure he did, man.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.134
There's-there's not a problem
that guy can't blast through.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.967
[laughter]Operator's an operator.

29:21.410 --> 29:23.139
I don't know how he does it.

29:23.190 --> 29:24.976
What do you mean?

29:25.020 --> 29:26.715
Life after the teams.
I mean, a pipehitter like him,

29:26.760 --> 29:28.580
how do you walk away
from all this, you know?

29:28.630 --> 29:29.938
He works part-time as an EMT.

29:29.980 --> 29:32.232
He's gonna serve his country,
he's gonna...

29:32.290 --> 29:33.803
Yeah, but that's it, man,
this isn't...

29:33.850 --> 29:36.466
this isn't just a job,
this is a...

29:36.510 --> 29:37.727
it's a, it's a,
it's a life.

29:37.770 --> 29:39.328
It's a life, yeah.

29:39.380 --> 29:41.166
This is ten times _the life
most people live.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.723
Okay.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.725
Look, riding with Bravo
is all I need.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.293
That's all you need,
riding with Bravo.

29:46.340 --> 29:48.820
What, been on our team
for, what, a year?

29:48.870 --> 29:51.953
Fully for, what,
eight years now? Okay.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.958
You may see things a little
differently with time, kid.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.968
All right, well, ifI start
seeing things differently...

29:58.010 --> 29:59.090
Mmm.

29:59.140 --> 30:00.573
...I-I'm-a need
to get my eyes checked.

30:00.620 --> 30:03.350
Okay. Check, how many numbers
am I holding up now, hm?

30:03.410 --> 30:04.832
Can you see that?

30:04.890 --> 30:06.141
[laughs] I don't know
what that is.

30:06.190 --> 30:07.885
[laughing]: That's okay.What is this, Jenga?

30:07.930 --> 30:09.443
[both laugh]

30:11.890 --> 30:13.619
You know,
when we almost lost Sonny,

30:13.680 --> 30:17.104
it became clear to me
what I have.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.334
I've got five guys around me
and one beating heart.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.429
Yup.Better than brothers.

30:23.470 --> 30:26.553
Honestly, I feel like
I'm-I'm lucky enough

30:26.600 --> 30:29.512
to be a part of that,
so I'm gonna give it all of me.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.733
Good,
and don't forget that, man.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.860
All right? Brothers.

30:32.910 --> 30:34.912
All right.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.009
Just give it all you got and
fill up that pitcher, will you?

30:38.050 --> 30:40.439
[laughs] Bless you, man,
in the name of the Father

30:40.490 --> 30:42.139
and of the Son.Thank you. Appreciate that.
All right.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.704
You've been baptized.Let's do it.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.883
DAVIS:
Sonny, what happened?

30:53.930 --> 30:55.192
Sonny, what's that noise?

31:00.590 --> 31:03.058
[panicked bystanders shouting]SONNY:
Get out of my way!

I'll call it in.
