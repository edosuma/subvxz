[HUM OF CONVERSATION]

00:33.400 --> 00:39.080
(♪ 'Bridge of Khazad Dum')

00:40.840 --> 00:43.560
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:44.880 --> 00:50.760
IAN MCKELLEN: Look ahead! The bridge
is near. It is dangerous and narrow.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.480
Suddenly Frodo saw before him
a black chasm.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.520
At the end of the hall,
the floor vanished

01:02.640 --> 01:05.040
and fell to an unknown depth.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.960
The outer door could only be reached
by a slender bridge of stone,

01:09.080 --> 01:11.480
without kerb or rail,
that spanned the chasm

01:11.600 --> 01:13.720
in one curving spring of 50 feet.

01:13.840 --> 01:18.600
At the brink, Gandalf halted and
the others came up in a pack behind.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.920
"Lead the way, Gimli:
Pippin and Merry next.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.320
"Straight on and up the stair
beyond the door!"

01:27.039 --> 01:28.800
Something was coming up behind them.

01:31.039 --> 01:35.759
What it was could not be seen:
it was like a great shadow,

01:35.880 --> 01:37.840
in the middle of which was a dark form,

01:37.960 --> 01:40.000
of man-shape maybe, yet greater:

01:40.120 --> 01:45.000
and a power and terror
seemed to be in it and to go before it.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.400
It came to the edge of the fire.
The light faded,

01:47.520 --> 01:49.280
as if a cloud had bent over it.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.560
And then with a rush,
it leapt across the fissure.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.080
And the flames roared up to greet it
and wreathed about it.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
In its right hand was a blade

01:57.320 --> 01:59.560
like a stabbing tongue of fire.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.760
In its other hand,
it held a whip of many thongs.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.880
"A Balrog," muttered Gandalf.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
"Now I understand!"

02:09.120 --> 02:12.440
And he faltered
and leaned heavily on his staff.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.560
The dark figure streaming with fire
raced towards them.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.600
"Over the bridge!" cried Gandalf,
recalling his strength.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.000
"Fly! This is a foe
beyond any of you.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.160
"I must hold the narrow way.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.440
"Fly!"

02:27.560 --> 02:29.680
The Balrog reached the bridge

02:29.800 --> 02:31.560
and Gandalf stood
in the middle of the span,

02:31.680 --> 02:35.120
leaning on the staff in his left hand:
but in his other hand,

02:35.240 --> 02:38.960
Glamdring gleamed cold and white.

02:39.079 --> 02:41.720
His enemy halted again, facing him,

02:41.840 --> 02:45.360
the shadow about it
stretched out like two vast wings.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.720
It raised its whip.
The thongs whined and cracked.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.079
Fire came from its nostrils.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.960
But still Gandalf stood firm.
"You cannot pass!"

02:55.079 --> 02:57.200
A dead silence fell.

02:57.320 --> 03:03.520
"I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the Flame of Anor.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.320
"You cannot pass.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.080
"The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.760
"Go back to the shadow.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.560
"You cannot pass."

03:15.680 --> 03:18.160
The Balrog made no answer.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.720
It stepped forward slowly
on to the bridge

03:20.840 --> 03:23.480
and suddenly raised itself
to a great height

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
and its wings
were spread from wall to wall.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.720
But still Gandalf could be seen,
glimmering in the gloom.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.920
Then from out of the shadow,
a red sword leaped, flaming.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.840
Glamdring glittered white in answer.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.680
There was a ringing clash,
a stab of white fire.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.640
And the Balrog fell back and its
sword flew up in molten fragments.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.040
And then with a bound,
it leapt full upon the bridge.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.320
Its whip whirled and hissed.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.280
And at that moment Gandalf,
crying aloud,

03:54.400 --> 03:57.120
smote the bridge before him.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.880
"You shall not pass!"

04:01.000 --> 04:03.400
And a blinding sheet
of white flame sprang up.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.960
The bridge cracked.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.400
Right at the Balrog's feet it broke

04:07.520 --> 04:11.240
and the stone upon which it stood
crashed into the gulf.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.240
And with a terrible cry,
the Balrog fell forward,

04:14.360 --> 04:18.040
its shadow plunged down and vanished.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.120
But even as it fell,
it swung its whip

04:20.240 --> 04:24.240
and the thongs lashed
and curled about the wizard's knees,

04:24.360 --> 04:25.720
dragging him to the brink.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.480
He staggered and fell,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.320
grasped vainly at the stone

04:29.440 --> 04:32.120
and slid into the abyss.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.720
"Fly, you fools!"

04:37.360 --> 04:38.680
And was gone.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.800
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

04:51.480 --> 04:53.240
[CHEERING]

05:04.480 --> 05:06.040
Hello. Thank you.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.720
Just in case you didn't realise,

05:10.840 --> 05:14.480
before it was made into all those movies,
Lord of the Rings used to be a book.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.960
[LAUGHTER]

05:16.080 --> 05:19.080
And Tolkien was writing that chapter,

05:19.200 --> 05:23.040
I think in Oxford, just about the time
I was getting ready to be born

05:23.160 --> 05:26.560
up north in the county of Lancashire.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.000
J R R...

05:28.120 --> 05:31.280
John, Ronald...
What does the other R for, do you know?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.080
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Reuel.
― Reuel, yes.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.159
It means friend of God.
Do you know what Tolkien means?

05:36.240 --> 05:37.560
[SILENCE]

05:38.840 --> 05:40.560
It means foolhardy.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.040
And I did perhaps wonder whether
I wasn't being a bit little foolhardy

05:45.159 --> 05:47.840
when Peter Jackson
came over to my house,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.520
it was 21 years ago,
to ask me to play Gandalf,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.280
because at that time,
there was no screenplay, no script.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.600
And to tell you the truth...

05:56.800 --> 05:58.159
..I'd never read Lord of the Rings.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.000
[LAUGHTER]

06:03.320 --> 06:05.280
Of course, ever since,

06:05.400 --> 06:08.880
I've been shamed by family and friends
and strangers who have.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.360
And some of them confide
almost reverentially,

06:12.480 --> 06:16.000
"I read Lord of the Rings every year!"

06:18.600 --> 06:20.480
[LAUGHTER]

06:31.480 --> 06:35.040
It's 1,137 pages.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.960
It the first week of the millennium.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.600
I'd just arrived in New Zealand,

06:41.720 --> 06:44.280
in the capital city, Wellington,
to start filming,

06:44.400 --> 06:46.200
and Peter Jackson,
who's a sociable fellow,

06:46.320 --> 06:48.640
took us all out for a welcoming meal.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.840
That's how I met for the first time
the four adorable hobbits.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.320
And the glamorous three ―

06:54.440 --> 06:57.960
Aragorn, Boromir and...Legolas.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.600
And sitting next to me,
a rival wizard, Saruman.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.760
Christopher Frank Carandini Lee...

07:15.880 --> 07:18.280
..the veteran of 200 movies,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.680
ten of which were Count Dracula.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.720
And quite early on in the meal,

07:24.840 --> 07:27.240
Christopher Lee turned his eyes
in my direction.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.840
I promise you, they were gleaming
as if he was contemplating a virgin neck.

07:36.800 --> 07:42.080
And then he confided,
"I read Lord of the Rings every year.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.800
"I've always thought
I should play Gandalf."

07:53.040 --> 07:56.800
Look, welcome
to the Harold Pinter Theatre.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.400
Good to have a theatre
named after a playwright. Look at it.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.320
Built 140 years ago.

08:04.800 --> 08:10.080
And one of the first actors on this stage
was the actor/manager Herbert Beerbohm,

08:10.200 --> 08:13.640
and after here, he went round the corner
to Her Majesty's Theatre

08:13.760 --> 08:16.080
and ran a company there for seven years,

08:16.200 --> 08:20.480
made so much money that he built a theatre
bang opposite His Majesty's.

08:20.600 --> 08:26.040
And he lived there and put on his famous
extravagant productions of Shakespeare.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.240
He was thought to be a bit old-fashioned,

08:28.360 --> 08:31.200
but no, rather up to date.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.200
He founded
the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.440
He was the first actor
ever to have his voice recorded.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.799
He made the first film of Shakespeare.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.640
Well, just a short one ―
an extract from King John.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.520
It was a silent movie.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.560
[LAUGHTER]

08:53.840 --> 08:56.840
And Shakespeare without the words
is a bit...

08:58.240 --> 09:00.440
It's a bit like Mozart without the music.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.160
Beerbohm's a German name,

09:06.280 --> 09:10.160
and he thought perhaps the Brits
would like something a little bit simpler.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.480
And so he translated the last syllable
into English

09:13.600 --> 09:16.360
and it became Sit Herbert Beerbohm...

09:16.480 --> 09:17.800
Tree.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.800
And he must have stood...

09:21.280 --> 09:22.960
..just where I am now.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.560
And many other wonderful actors.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.880
Not me. First time
I've been on this stage.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.920
I've sat out there
on many happy occasions.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.800
I've been on the road.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.320
I've been visiting theatres I know well,

09:37.440 --> 09:39.280
and a few that I don't know at all.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.480
This is my skip, my box.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.520
This is what actors used to have
when they went on the road.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.920
They were usually made of wicker.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.640
You kept your costumes in them, props,
things you'd need on the road.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.400
And there are the places
that we've been to.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.880
87 theatres.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.560
And the first one was only last year,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.280
at my local arts centre
on the Isle of Dogs.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.160
Then 15 theatres in London
and then round England and Wales.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.440
And we ended up, beautifully, in Orkney.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.520
Oh, and we went to Northern Ireland.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.680
Yep, there we are ― the Braid.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.360
That's in Ballymena in County Antrim,

10:15.480 --> 10:17.520
which is where the McKellens come from.

10:17.640 --> 10:21.200
We were bequeathed
this dreadful surname...

10:22.920 --> 10:25.680
..that few people
outside County Antrim can spell properly.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.080
Just for the record,
it's capital M, small C,

10:29.200 --> 10:32.080
capital K, E-L-L-E-N.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.520
E-N!

10:34.800 --> 10:38.720
It's not A-N. and of course, it doesn't
really matter, but I used to think it did.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.520
And I wondered whether I shouldn't
adopt a stage name

10:41.640 --> 10:43.920
like Sir Herbert's.

10:44.040 --> 10:49.520
Then I remembered working with the actor
Timothy Carlton,

10:49.640 --> 10:53.320
just after his wife had given birth
to their first child, Benedict.

10:53.440 --> 10:58.480
And Tim said to me one day, "You know,
my real surname, it's not Carlton at all.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.880
"It's Cumberbatch."

11:05.920 --> 11:08.920
He said, "Can you imagine trying to have
a success as an actor if you're...?"

11:13.000 --> 11:14.600
[APPLAUSE]

11:16.840 --> 11:18.920
And on there somewhere is Home,

11:19.040 --> 11:22.480
which is the wonderful name for
the newest theatre built in Manchester,

11:22.600 --> 11:25.760
which is where
the McKellens emigrated to.

who most recently directed me
in No Man's Land by...

11:45.680 --> 11:47.360
Harold Pinter...

11:47.480 --> 11:50.040
during rehearsals for this said,

11:50.160 --> 11:52.200
"Ian, wouldn't it be great,
when the audience arrives

11:52.320 --> 11:53.320
"if the box is already there...

11:53.440 --> 11:55.040
"and you're inside it?""

12:02.120 --> 12:04.880
"Sean, what on earth
would I be doing inside a box?"

12:05.640 --> 12:08.240
And he said,
"Because the audience would like it."

12:10.200 --> 12:13.920
Which is a jolly good reason. But I can't
get in there ― there's so much else.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.160

it's a bit heavy. There we are.

― Yeah.

There we are. Are you all right?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.680

14:53.480 --> 14:55.360
he invented the portable camera.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.520
All right, Iljama. Do you want to pop the
sword back in the scabbard for me?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.920
― OK.
― Yeah.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.000
I don't think I'll be able
to put it back in.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.600

15:06.720 --> 15:08.240
No, no, no, you...

15:08.360 --> 15:11.200

15:11.320 --> 15:13.000
― OK.
― I'll help you.

Well, you do now.

15:28.640 --> 15:33.200
All right. This is as close as I'm
going to get to an autobiography.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.800
I wrote it specially for the tour.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.880
It's just an autobiography,
really, with...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.720
Those are all the places we went to.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.360
And it's full of photographs.
Who's that? Do you know?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.880
― Is it you?
― That's me there.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.960
Who's that one? Don't know?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.920
All right, I won't tell Patrick Stewart.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720

― Yep.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.360
That's right, good.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.800
Well, it's nice to have your name
spelled properly,

― isn't it?
― Yes.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.840

No, no, that's wasn't me.
That was Gandalf.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.119
You know, Iljama...

17:11.240 --> 17:13.800
Iljama, the best day was when...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.960
..this helicopter lifted the nine members
of The Fellowship up, up, up...

17:20.079 --> 17:22.160
to the Southern Alps. And off it went,

17:22.280 --> 17:24.960
and the cameraman inside it filmed me

17:25.079 --> 17:28.119
leading the way
up this narrow, snowy ridge,

17:28.240 --> 17:29.840
I promise you, up to our knees.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.840
No human being
could ever have been there before.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.040
Down here, there was a perilous drop
and up there, Mount Cook,

17:37.160 --> 17:39.040
where I knew Edmund Hillary had trained

17:39.160 --> 17:41.520
for the successful ascent
of Mount Everest.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.800
He was a bit of a hero in our household.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.280
My dad used to climb
in the Lake District and Snowdonia.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.160
Crampons, ropes, all that.
And as a treat for me,

17:51.280 --> 17:54.600
they invited Edmund Hillary
to come and see us filming.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.040
And it turned out it was going to be
a bit of a thrill for him too,

17:58.160 --> 18:01.680
because he was a huge Tolkien fan.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.440
So you can imagine my excitement ―

18:04.560 --> 18:08.760
suddenly there he is at the end of the
corridor. The conqueror of Everest.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.560
Six foot three inches tall,
a bit stooped now,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.720
like Gandalf, and oh, a lovely long face.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.120
A bit like my dad's, actually ―
big jutting jaw.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.920
And he held out his great big paw.
And he said,

18:20.040 --> 18:23.240
"I read Lord of the Rings every year."

in Wigan...

..on a Sunday, hymns all day long.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.760
10:30 in the morning, church service,
Sunday School in the afternoon,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.480
then back to church in the evening.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.720
Congregational Church.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.600
And the Congregationalists,
as their name implies, are in charge.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.720
They organise everything
through their monthly meeting.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.000
There's no hierarchy.
They make all the big decisions,

19:20.120 --> 19:21.320
like who's going to be their minister.

19:21.440 --> 19:27.240
And in Romiley in Cheshire, where
we've already been with the show...

19:27.360 --> 19:30.800
Yep, there we are ― the Forum, Romiley.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.920
The Congregational Church there

19:33.040 --> 19:35.840
appointed my mother's father
to be their minister,

19:35.960 --> 19:37.640
and my dad was a lay preacher.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.680
So was his dad, Grandad McKellen.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.520
And he had a bit of a theatrical bent.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.120
If he felt that the congregation

19:45.240 --> 19:46.960
weren't really paying him
quite enough attention,

19:47.080 --> 19:48.400
he'd suddenly say,
in the middle of the sermon,

19:48.520 --> 19:51.000
"I can see the children of Israel!"

19:52.800 --> 19:57.040
And half the congregation would fall
for it and turn round to look where...

19:58.080 --> 20:01.000
So I come from a family who are at ease...

20:01.800 --> 20:05.840
..with public speaking in the pulpit
and the classroom ―

20:05.960 --> 20:07.240
lots of teachers in the family.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.520
My sister Jean, five years older.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.200
She was an English teacher.
She married a teacher.

20:13.320 --> 20:18.280
Our Uncle Ken was a teacher ― first one
in the family to get to university.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.760
Kenneth Sutcliffe.
He ended up as headmaster

20:20.880 --> 20:24.560
of Latymer Upper School for Boys,
here in West London,

20:24.680 --> 20:28.600
at a time when Alan Rickman was a student.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.520
And now, look,
Uncle Ken was a bit of a stick,

20:31.640 --> 20:34.120
but I checked with Alan
and he promised me

20:34.240 --> 20:37.920
he did not base Professor Snape
on my uncle.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.480
So we are a family of communicators.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.680
Proselytisers on occasion.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.680
And performers...amateur performers.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.240
My grandmother was a renowned soprano.

20:55.920 --> 21:00.080
And when Grandad McKellen first saw
his future wife, she was singing hymns.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.680
Solos for the church choir
in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester.

21:06.280 --> 21:11.160
And he said,
"Ian, I fell in love with her voice."

21:13.360 --> 21:16.520
And back in Romiley,
when she was a girl...

21:18.000 --> 21:21.080
..my mother used to do a bit of amateur
acting with the church players.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.760
And sister Jean...

21:22.880 --> 21:26.120
Oh, well, she was an enthusiastic amateur
all her life,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.480
and as a girl, she sang in choirs,

21:28.600 --> 21:32.920
and at home, played duets with Dad on
the upright Bechstein in the front room.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.120
And Dad's hands...

21:37.160 --> 21:39.320
A bit like Edmund Hillary's.
They were huge!

21:40.080 --> 21:41.680
The fingers...

21:41.800 --> 21:45.480
so thick, sometimes
they got stuck between the keys.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.480
A very early memory for me
was trying to get to sleep,

21:49.600 --> 21:54.520
and Dad pounding his way through
a Chopin sonata on the piano below.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.720
I've got the piano in here somewhere.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.680
[LAUGHTER]

22:01.800 --> 22:05.200
Promise I have. I've got the piano
in here because...

22:06.800 --> 22:10.680
..The Piano is a 12-line
poem by David Herbert Lawrence.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.160
Look at that ―
all those poems by a novelist.

22:14.280 --> 22:18.280
Actually I once played DH Lawrence
in the film Priest of love.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
[SILENCE]

22:19.520 --> 22:20.760
Which you never saw.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.120
[LAUGHTER]

22:25.840 --> 22:28.520
But if you're a fan of Ava Gardner,
have a look at Priest of Love.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.720
It was her last movie.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.160
The Piano.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.200
Softly, in the dusk,
a woman is singing to me

22:44.640 --> 22:48.080
Taking me back down the vista of years

22:49.000 --> 22:52.360
Till I see a child sitting under the piano

22:52.480 --> 22:54.040
In the boom of the tingling strings

22:54.160 --> 22:57.440
And pressing the small,
poised feet of a mother

22:57.560 --> 22:59.960
Who smiles as she sings

23:00.080 --> 23:01.640
In spite of myself

23:01.760 --> 23:04.640
The insidious mastery of song

23:04.760 --> 23:06.320
Betrays me back

23:06.440 --> 23:08.640
Till the heart of me weeps to belong

23:08.760 --> 23:11.920
To the old Sunday evenings at home,
with winter outside

23:12.040 --> 23:14.320
And hymns in the cosy parlour

23:14.440 --> 23:16.760
The tinkling piano our guide

23:16.880 --> 23:21.080
So now it is vain
for the singer to burst into clamour

23:21.200 --> 23:25.240
With the great black piano appassionato

23:25.360 --> 23:26.520
The glamour

23:26.640 --> 23:31.320
Of childish days is upon me,
my manhood is cast

23:31.440 --> 23:34.000
Down in the flood of remembrance

23:34.120 --> 23:40.480
I weep like a child for the past.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.440
"So, young Master McKellen,
what do you want to be when you grow up?"

23:48.560 --> 23:50.480
This is Auntie Dorothy one Christmas.

23:50.600 --> 23:57.040
"Do you want to be a preacher,
like your grandad? Yes? Yes?"

23:57.160 --> 23:59.440
"No. No."

23:59.560 --> 24:03.480
"Do you want to be, oh, a teacher,
like your Uncle Ken? Yes?"

24:03.600 --> 24:05.080
"No."

24:05.200 --> 24:09.920
"Well, do you want to be
a civil engineer, like your dad?"

24:10.080 --> 24:13.280
And I screamed inside, "No, no, no!

24:13.400 --> 24:15.920
"I want to go into hotel management."

24:16.040 --> 24:18.360
[LAUGHTER]

24:24.280 --> 24:27.480
For years, I wanted to be a chef,

24:27.600 --> 24:29.400
and then a journalist,

24:29.520 --> 24:31.240
and then something...

24:32.000 --> 24:34.200
Not an actor. Well, not yet.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.320
Eventually, inevitably.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.840
I suppose it all began
when I was very young.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.320
One Wednesday morning.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.320
I was taken out
of my nursery school in Wigan.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.920
I was three. Three years old.

24:49.040 --> 24:53.280
And we were going on our first family
theatre outing to Manchester ― big city.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.560
On the train.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.960
The steam train.

24:58.560 --> 25:02.360
And we were going to go
to the Palace Theatre.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.520
What a wonderful name for a theatre.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.800
And we were all going to see Peter Pan.
And all through the journey,

25:08.920 --> 25:11.760
"Mummy, will it be a real crocodile?

25:11.880 --> 25:14.000
"Mummy, will they really fly?"

25:15.760 --> 25:17.840
"Well, we'll have to wait and see."

25:18.880 --> 25:22.520
Well, the trouble was I could see.
I mean, I could see the wires.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.000
And the croc...

25:27.120 --> 25:30.000
It was obviously just a silly man
crawling about on his tummy.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.440
I don't know ―
three years old and a critic.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.520
Tinkerbell ―
it was obviously just a torch!

25:40.960 --> 25:43.560
Mind you, when Peter Pan said
we were to clap

25:43.680 --> 25:45.160
if we believed in fairies,

25:45.280 --> 25:46.920
I clapped away.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.280
I've been clapping ever since.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.280
[APPLAUSE]

25:58.480 --> 26:02.360
And that's one of those moments. You don't
see it coming and it changes your life.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.840
Dad whispered, "We've got to go!"

26:07.120 --> 26:08.520
Before the end of the show.

26:08.960 --> 26:12.520
Get the train back to Wigan.
And we're pushing along the row

26:12.640 --> 26:16.800
where we've been sitting up there,
getting to the side door to go.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.680
And just before,
I have one last look at the stage.

26:24.600 --> 26:29.800
And the backcloth
is covered in little stars.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.640
In Neverland.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.120
And I thought...

26:36.240 --> 26:39.120
"I want more of this. I'm coming back."

26:39.240 --> 26:41.840
And it wasn't
that I wanted to be on the stage.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.960
No, I wanted to be behind it,
either side of it, underneath it.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
Is that possible?

26:47.200 --> 26:50.160
Above it. Find out
where did all the wires go to?

26:50.280 --> 26:53.360
How does it all work?
What's behind the scenery?

26:53.480 --> 26:54.840
And anyway...

26:56.120 --> 26:57.880
How do you make starlight?

27:01.080 --> 27:02.440
So this...

27:03.080 --> 27:04.560
..passion grew.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.920
And it wasn't a passion for the church.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.400
It wasn't a passion for music.
I still can't play the piano.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.560
It wasn't a passion for cricket.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.480
It could have been, because at the end
of our garden was the Wigan Cricket Club,

27:15.600 --> 27:17.960
and every Saturday during the season,

27:18.080 --> 27:19.160
I saw every single game,

27:19.280 --> 27:23.680
and on Sundays, I used to race back from
Sunday School to score for the Second XI.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.480
Look what I've just found at home.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.440

27:31.320 --> 27:33.200
AUDIENCE: Awww!

27:36.960 --> 27:38.160
It's my studio chair.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.120
They gave it to me
on the last day of Priest of Love.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.800
Not what I was looking for.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
Here we are.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.720
Well, perhaps for you.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.720
Here's my theatre diary.

28:44.840 --> 28:49.880
"One week ago,
I saw Mr Novello's King's Rhapsody

28:50.000 --> 28:51.600
"at the Palace Theatre, Manchester."

28:51.720 --> 28:54.600
Ah, so we did go back there. Now, that
needs a bit of an explanation these days.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.280
King's Rhapsody...

28:57.280 --> 29:02.880
..was the last of the great extravagant
sentimental operettas ― musicals...

29:03.000 --> 29:07.520
by Ivor Novello,
the Welsh composer and actor,

29:07.640 --> 29:12.080
remembered these days
for the Novello Theatre in London and...

29:12.200 --> 29:17.960
oh, everywhere, every year with the
Ivor Novello Awards for popular music.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.480
When he was 21 years old,

29:19.600 --> 29:23.280
he had written the hit song of...

29:23.400 --> 29:26.200
the First World War,
still remembered today.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.400

30:23.760 --> 30:28.200
And then later, in the Second World War,
he wrote We'll Gather Lilacs.

30:28.320 --> 30:31.320
He didn't sing himself,
but he was always in the musicals

30:31.440 --> 30:32.800
and he accompanied the leading ladies.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.800
In the case of King's Rhapsody,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.520
she was called... Well!

30:37.880 --> 30:41.360
Well, his leading lady
in King's Rhapsody had a stage name

30:41.480 --> 30:43.480
and it had been given to her
by Ivor Novello.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.160
He said, "I'm going to name you

30:45.280 --> 30:48.040
"after the most beautiful actress
working today.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.360
"And I'm going to give you her initials
and her second name.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.000
"We'll spell it differently."

30:53.120 --> 30:55.280
And that's how young Vanessa Lee

30:55.400 --> 30:59.360
was named
after the beautiful Vivien Leigh.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.320
Oh, and was Ivor beautiful!

31:02.440 --> 31:05.720
Oh, you have a look at his
early photographs in his silent movies ―

31:05.840 --> 31:07.960
two of them directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.560
On stage, total matinee idol.

31:10.680 --> 31:15.840
One year, he'd won an award for the
most glamorous profile in the world.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.480
And the hit song in King's Rhapsody was

31:20.600 --> 31:24.320
♪ Someday my heart will awake

31:25.640 --> 31:27.000
♪ Someday... ♪

31:28.760 --> 31:30.160

31:31.280 --> 31:35.360

my mother's birthday treat, my heart...

31:36.160 --> 31:39.680
I mean...Ivor Novello...

31:40.760 --> 31:44.720
..upstage centre. Profile on display.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.480
Tailored silken dressing gown.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.120
And at the exact moment

31:49.240 --> 31:51.960
when he seductively handed over
a glass of champagne

31:52.080 --> 31:55.000
to young Vanessa Lee
on the chaise longue,

31:55.120 --> 31:56.120
up there in row C,

31:56.240 --> 31:57.840
I had my first erection.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.200
[LAUGHTER]

32:09.360 --> 32:11.400
And I've loved the theatre ever since.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.080
[APPLAUSE]

32:18.280 --> 32:20.960
I mean, loved it as you love it,
as theatregoers.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.880
And it was sister Jean
started taking me to the theatre.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.000
When I was ten,

32:27.120 --> 32:29.560
she took me off
to the Wigan Little Theatre

32:29.680 --> 32:32.480
to see the amateurs there
do Twelfth Night.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.600
First Shakespeare I'd ever seen.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.880
And shortly after,
at the same address, Macbeth.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.560
And my boyhood
seemed to be packed with Shakespeare.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.520
Our school took an annual camp
to Stratford-upon-Avon,

32:48.640 --> 32:50.160
where Shakespeare was born.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.760
Under canvas, and then we
punted up the River Avon

32:52.880 --> 32:54.680
to the old Memorial Theatre,

32:54.800 --> 32:59.920
where some of the most illustrious
performers of my youth

33:00.040 --> 33:02.520
were in the summer season
of Shakespeare there.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.680
Most exciting of all for me,

33:04.800 --> 33:07.600
Sir Laurence Olivier.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.280
And I saw him first playing Malvolio
in Twelfth Night.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.640
Second time I'd seen the play.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.920
And in the same season, Macbeth.

33:17.640 --> 33:22.080
And his wife in the play
was played by his actual wife,

33:22.200 --> 33:25.760
the beautiful Vivien Leigh.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.400
Then I started going to the theatre...

33:31.680 --> 33:33.760
..by myself. I hesitate because...

33:33.880 --> 33:36.400
Well, it's true of everything, but...

33:37.200 --> 33:42.520
My relationship with the live theatre has
been very dependent on luck. Good luck.

33:43.320 --> 33:47.560
And...the luck was that Dad got a new job

33:47.680 --> 33:53.360
and we moved from Wigan
all of 11 miles away to Bolton.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.520
And 150,000 people
in the cotton spinning town,

33:57.640 --> 34:01.720
and in Bolton, they had three
fully functioning commercial theatres,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.520
and I went to them all.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.560
Number one, the Hippodrome.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.199
This housed
the Lawrence Williamson Players

34:10.320 --> 34:15.679
and they did weekly rep ― a weekly
repertory of a new play every Monday.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.639
Thriller, light comedy, farce.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.360
And that would play through the week
in the evenings,

34:20.480 --> 34:24.159
while during the day, the actors rehearsed
the following week's play.

34:24.280 --> 34:28.840
They'd been doing this
without a break for 27 years,

34:28.960 --> 34:32.560
and some of the actors had been
in the company that length of time.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.440
And they obviously
didn't get paid enough money

34:34.560 --> 34:37.199
and they certainly
didn't get enough rehearsal.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.880
[LAUGHTER]

34:43.719 --> 34:48.080
So I'm afraid it was 27 years
of rather dodgy productions.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.840
But I did not care.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.040
Then in Churchgate in Bolton...

34:56.560 --> 34:57.920
..we had the Theatre Royal.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.840
Now, this was something.
It had been designed

34:59.960 --> 35:03.120
by the great late-19th-century
architect of British theatres,

35:03.240 --> 35:05.720
Frank Matcham.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.640
Some of them
still remain up and down the place.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.760
I've played them on this tour ―
Theatre Royal, Newcastle

35:11.880 --> 35:14.760
and the Lyric Hammersmith,
and there are others in London ―

35:14.880 --> 35:17.440
the Palladium, the Coliseum,
the Victoria Palace.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.360
But in Bolton, the Theatre Royal.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.760
And this put on tours ― Ballet Rambert.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.120
Carl Rosa Opera,
Gilbert and Sullivan...

35:27.240 --> 35:29.400
Oh, and at Christmas, the pantomime.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.720
I love pantomime.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.400
I see a pantomime every year.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.240
Well, many more than one
if I can manage it.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.880
What an introduction to the theatre
pantomime is,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.720
because anything that's theatrical
works in a pantomime, doesn't it,

35:49.840 --> 35:51.520
from transforming scenery

35:51.640 --> 35:55.560
to outrageous costumes
and singing and dancing and poetry.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.320
A moral story.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.840
Silly jokes, dirty jokes,
audience participation.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.960
It invented here.
It belongs to us. It's ours.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.360
Doesn't travel very well.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.400
Well, I mean you try explaining
to somebody what a pantomime is.

36:13.520 --> 36:17.280
Ah, well, you see,
there's all this cross-dressing.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.000
And the principal boy
isn't actually a boy.

36:20.120 --> 36:24.360
No, she's a girl.
And the dame is not really a dame.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.880
He's a bloke in a frock.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.680
Oh, it's nothing to do with
female impersonation.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.280
And when I came to achieve a lifetime's
ambition of playing there myself,

36:34.400 --> 36:37.960
it was here in London
at The Old Vic theatre

36:38.080 --> 36:44.240
and we were doing Aladdin.
I was playing his mother, Widow Twankey,

36:44.360 --> 36:47.560
and Sean, who was directing,
had assembled

36:47.680 --> 36:50.640
a world-beating troupe of talent
onstage and off.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.520
I thought, I'm really going to
have to find out how to do this.

36:52.640 --> 36:58.880
So I found a man who had played dames
professionally 40 times ―

36:59.000 --> 37:02.240
the Welsh prince of laughter, Wyn Calvin,

37:02.360 --> 37:05.760
and he said,
"Well, I'm only too happy to help, Ian.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.400
"Now, look, if you're going to play dames,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.280
"there are two things
that are very important to remember.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.920
"Number one...

37:13.840 --> 37:16.880
"..warm your bra on the radiator."

37:17.000 --> 37:18.600
[LAUGHTER]

37:24.960 --> 37:29.880
"And two ― get your first entrance right.
I'll tell you what I do.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.280
"I'm running a laundry, as you know,
in old Peking.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.800
"And I just dashed out to do a little bit
of shopping on my own down the market.

37:39.320 --> 37:43.200
"Looking for bargains.
And I'm on my way back home.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.040
"Of course I've got my shopping bag
with me,

37:46.160 --> 37:49.240
"and I make my entrance
from the prompt corner.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.640
"And of course the audience
sees me immediately,

37:51.760 --> 37:54.120
"but I pretend that I don't see them.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.920
"I pay them no heed.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.120
"And I get to the centre of the stage
then I have a little stop in the middle.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.320
"Then I go back the way I came.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.960
"I still don't see them.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.120
"And then I wait
until I get to the middle of the stage,

38:07.240 --> 38:08.400
"then I give a little trip,

38:08.520 --> 38:10.960

39:54.800 --> 39:56.480
And one for you.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.120
Go on!

40:00.640 --> 40:02.160

40:09.480 --> 40:10.720
Oh dear!

40:11.680 --> 40:13.280
All right!

40:13.760 --> 40:15.160
Oh dear!

40:17.480 --> 40:19.240
No, it's always nice, isn't it,

40:19.360 --> 40:20.880
to have something to suck?

40:27.520 --> 40:30.200
Go on, darling, there you are!

40:34.200 --> 40:36.600
AUDIENCE: Woo!

40:42.200 --> 40:43.840
Anyone fancy a banana?

40:49.480 --> 40:52.000
Go on, you little monkey!

40:54.520 --> 40:56.760
We'll have another go. Come on.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.680
[AUDIENCE GASPS]

41:03.000 --> 41:04.640
All right.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.600
[LAUGHTER]

41:16.120 --> 41:17.800
(MOUTHS)

41:21.920 --> 41:24.080
Go on. Go on.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.200
Come on. Come and get it.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.440
[CHEERING]

41:39.040 --> 41:40.720
And do be careful.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.400
Is there an older gentleman
who'd like a carrot?

41:51.920 --> 41:54.480
Go on ― you stick that up your Brexit.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.560
I've got to be on my way.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.280
I'm expecting the repairman ― he's
coming round to service my Hotpoint.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.320
All this chatting to you
and I've got just a little behind.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.760
[CHEERING AND WHISTLING]

42:26.360 --> 42:30.000
All right. So in Churchgate,
we've got the Theatre Royal

42:30.120 --> 42:31.440
then there's a little alleyway.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.840
Little alleyway here
and then there's another theatre.

42:35.640 --> 42:38.840
Right next door.
Also built by Frank Matcham. We had two.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.600
The Grand Theatre. My favourite.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.800
My favourite.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.040
The Grand put on variety. Do you remember?

42:53.160 --> 42:57.040
Variety? Every Monday
new performers would arrive in town

42:57.160 --> 43:00.160
and play twice nightly through the week.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.800
Some of them quite famous.
I'd heard them on the radio.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.600
And in the Grand, you got performers

43:05.720 --> 43:08.320
you couldn't get on the radio,
like dancers.

43:11.920 --> 43:15.520
Like acrobats and magicians.

43:17.120 --> 43:22.320
Escapologists. I remember Alan Alan,
The Man They Cannot Hang.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.680
And luck.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.640
The Grand was managed by...

43:33.920 --> 43:38.000
..James Bleakley.
Alderman James Bleakley.

43:38.120 --> 43:41.080
Very big in Bolton. He had been the mayor.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.240
Alderman James Bleakley.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.280
Tory, but nice.

43:51.440 --> 43:56.080
And as luck would have it,
he works on occasion in the town hall.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.760
And so did my dad, and they got talking
and Alderman Bleakley said,

43:58.880 --> 44:01.480
"Oh, yes, that will be all right
if young Ian

44:01.600 --> 44:04.960
"wants to come down to the Grand
one evening,

44:05.080 --> 44:06.560
"see how it all works.

44:06.680 --> 44:10.960
"Maybe go backstage. Yeah.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.360
"Well, not on a Monday.
Let the turns get settled in.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.240
"Say Tuesday? Before first house.

44:15.360 --> 44:19.480
"Six o'clock. Tell him to go down
to Churchgate, down the little alleyway,

44:19.600 --> 44:22.360
"knock on t'stage door,
say that I sent him."

44:22.480 --> 44:24.440
And so...

44:24.560 --> 44:26.360
Hello. It's Ian McKellen.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.720
McKellen.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.200
Alderman Bleakley said that...
Oh, thank you.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
"Go on, lad. Go down the stairs.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.520
"Watch yourself ― they're a bit slippy.

44:43.520 --> 44:47.320
"When you get to the bottom,
you'll be on the stage."

44:52.760 --> 44:54.000
Oh.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.440
I can see the wires.

45:00.720 --> 45:05.480
The hempen ropes going up,
up from the wings to the flies,

45:05.600 --> 45:09.760
and they supported the cloths that went
up and down between the performers

45:09.880 --> 45:11.880
on the brightly lit stage here.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.920
Here in the wings, we're in the dark.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.480
It's a bit murky, bit musty, dusty, dirty.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.280
Bare boards.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.360
Nail sticking up, heads of old screws.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.600
And in the corner, Alf ―
he's the stage manager.

45:26.720 --> 45:30.080
He gives the cues
for the performers to go on stage.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.120
And that's where I have to be,
next to him.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.560
Oh, they start coming down
from their dressing rooms.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.240
And, oh...

45:37.360 --> 45:42.520
Dreadful dressing rooms ―
cracked basins, broken mirrors. Hi-ho.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.560
The glamorous life.

45:45.280 --> 45:49.360
And, oh, they look marvellous, all
done up for the stage in their feathers

45:49.480 --> 45:52.600
and their hats and sequins and glitter.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.480
All got this strange orange makeup.

45:57.720 --> 46:00.120
Which always seemed to end
just about there.

46:02.040 --> 46:08.120
And they're bickering.
I can hear them arguing, complaining.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.920
What, is it the new digs?

46:11.400 --> 46:14.880
Imagine new digs every Monday,
every week, every month.

46:17.640 --> 46:19.520
Not a good atmosphere backstage.

46:19.640 --> 46:24.000
And then their music
starts up in the orchestra pit.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.040
Joe Hill's Band.

46:27.160 --> 46:30.120
And Alf gets ready.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.480
And gives the cue,

46:32.600 --> 46:34.960
and onto the stage they go.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.640
Transformed.

46:39.480 --> 46:42.520
By the glare of the lights
and your attention,

46:42.640 --> 46:44.960
and this reality in the wings...

46:45.760 --> 46:50.400
..put to one side, forgotten for,
what, just...seven minutes.

46:51.200 --> 46:55.920
And a whole new reality created...

46:57.360 --> 46:59.240
And I felt at home...

47:01.280 --> 47:04.920
..with them. Because a theatre
is a house, isn't it?

47:05.040 --> 47:08.960
Playhouse, opera house.
Main house, full house.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.520
And I did not want to go home.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.280
Here I am, backstage for the first time,

47:15.400 --> 47:19.560
wondering what it would
actually feel like to be on stage myself.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.560
And that's why I started acting.

47:23.160 --> 47:27.320
Initially at school,
Bolton School for Boys.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.120
Lots of theatre going on there.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.520
We had our own miniature theatre.

47:32.640 --> 47:36.160
50 family and friends could fit in
to see us do our programme

47:36.280 --> 47:40.440
of one-act plays every term,
all the time I was at school.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.720
And then I graduated to the main event ―

47:42.840 --> 47:46.240
the annual school play in the Great Hall.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.480
That ran for six performances
through the week.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.320
Classics one year.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.360
Shakespeare, Henry V.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.960
I played King Henry.

47:56.080 --> 48:00.000
And in front of us
were these 1,100 chairs.

48:00.840 --> 48:04.320
Always rush bottoms
that squeaked and creaked and...

48:05.400 --> 48:08.080
Our first job as young actors was
(PROJECTING) to pitch our voices...

48:08.200 --> 48:11.120
over the sound of the chairs...

48:11.240 --> 48:12.720
And I realised that acting,

48:12.840 --> 48:17.760
acting is something that you
have to learn, but that you can learn it.

48:17.880 --> 48:21.480
And more than anything else
in my young life...

48:22.440 --> 48:26.200
..I wanted to learn how to act
because I was going to become an actor.

48:28.040 --> 48:30.960
Not a professional.
No, I'm going to be an amateur.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.920
Amateur, like my sister Jean and...

48:34.040 --> 48:36.520
Like the masters at school,
when they'd finished with us

48:36.640 --> 48:41.720
would go off to do their amateur
productions at the Bolton Little Theatre.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.040
And when it came to leave school...

48:45.680 --> 48:49.600
..I was persuaded to try and follow
Uncle Ken to his university.

48:50.320 --> 48:54.160
So I took the entrance exams for Cambridge

48:54.280 --> 48:58.720
and I don't know by what lucky fluke

48:58.840 --> 49:01.680
I got in, and now
there's just one obstacle left

49:01.800 --> 49:05.080
between me and three years
at Cambridge University

49:05.200 --> 49:07.760
studying English literature.

49:09.280 --> 49:14.320
And so I went up to meet the man
who would inadvertently settle my fate ―

49:14.440 --> 49:18.880
Tom Henn at St Catharine's College
in Cambridge.

49:20.240 --> 49:23.760
Tom Henn was from County Sligo.

49:24.560 --> 49:25.560
And...

49:25.680 --> 49:31.440
he'd written books on WB Yeats
and William Shakespeare.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.320
Had a very distinctive limp.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.400
He had been Brigadier Tom Henn
during the war.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.200
I assumed this was a result
of some distinguished war wound.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.920
It turned out later

49:42.040 --> 49:44.320
he'd fallen down his staircase
drunk one night.

49:47.960 --> 49:52.280
And I was sent up to his rooms
in C Staircase at St Catharine's,

49:52.400 --> 49:54.000
put down there on the padded stool.

49:54.120 --> 49:57.120
(IRISH ACCENT) "Well, now,
good afternoon to you, Mr...

49:57.920 --> 50:00.800
"McKellen... McKellen?

50:01.800 --> 50:06.240
"Well, now, that would be an Antrim name.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.320
"Well, Mr McKellen,

50:10.440 --> 50:15.200
"it says here that you are...an actor.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.440
"Where have you acted?

50:19.920 --> 50:21.360
"At school?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.640
"Have you acted in any Shakespeare?

50:26.800 --> 50:28.080
"Henry V?

50:29.120 --> 50:31.760
"All right. Do me your speech."

50:34.040 --> 50:35.240
I'm not really thinking about it.

50:35.360 --> 50:39.120
I just jumped up onto the stool
as if I was still in the Great Hall.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.440
And I let Tom Henn have it.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.560
(BELLOWING) Once more unto the breach!

50:44.680 --> 50:50.360
Cry God for Harry, England and St George!

50:50.480 --> 50:52.360
And he gave me a scholarship.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.520
[APPLAUSE]

51:03.960 --> 51:06.160
One of my worst performances.

51:07.240 --> 51:08.880
And most successful auditions.

51:10.760 --> 51:14.200
Now I'd arrived at my drama school ―

51:14.320 --> 51:17.360
not that Cambridge
had a drama faculty then ―

51:17.480 --> 51:22.120
but it was full of people my age
as crazy about the theatre as I was.

51:22.640 --> 51:27.160
Some of them, like young Derek Jacobi
and Clive Swift,

51:27.280 --> 51:30.640
they were going to become
professionals after graduation.

51:30.760 --> 51:35.440
So was Miriam Margolyes, Peter Cook,
David Frost and Trevor Nunn.

51:35.560 --> 51:39.680
Not me. No, no,
I'm still going to be an amateur.

51:40.480 --> 51:44.920
And so three years of bliss, really.
21 undergraduate productions.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.120
And then what?

51:50.360 --> 51:54.320
I thought, what job can I possibly get

51:54.440 --> 51:58.560
which will allow me to go on acting
at the rate at which I've been acting...

51:59.240 --> 52:00.600
..at Cambridge?

52:00.720 --> 52:03.760
Unless of course
I actually become a professional.

52:05.160 --> 52:08.400
I thought, who's going to take me
seriously as a professional actor?

52:09.280 --> 52:11.760
Then I thought,
well, if Derek Jacobi can do it...

52:17.200 --> 52:19.800
Sounds like a line out of Vicious.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.480
No, Derek was streets ahead of me
at Cambridge.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.720
He's one of those people
who just seems to leap out of the cradle

52:25.840 --> 52:27.560
fully formed as an actor.

52:27.680 --> 52:32.360
And off he went to the prestigious
Birmingham Rep.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.240
And where was I gonna go?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.360
Well, I couldn't go to Bolton.

52:39.640 --> 52:44.960
They'd pulled down the Hippodrome
and they pulled down the Theatre Royal.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.840
And one dreadful afternoon
during the long vacation,

52:48.960 --> 52:50.960
I went to have a look at the Grand.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.480
And the roof was off
and I could see the benches...

52:58.200 --> 53:01.920
..in the gods open to the sky
until they too were chucked out.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.560
And luck.

53:09.560 --> 53:12.800
This theatre was beginning to change...

53:14.320 --> 53:15.560
..at that time, and change for the better.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.840
The old weekly, commercial weekly reps,

53:18.960 --> 53:20.080
they were on their way out.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.680
They were being replaced
by theatres that were subsidised

53:22.800 --> 53:25.760
with the little bit of public money
from local authorities

53:25.880 --> 53:28.560
or the Central Arts Council
of Great Britain.

53:28.680 --> 53:33.000
And in the Midlands, after
the devastation of the war bombing...

53:34.120 --> 53:36.360
..in Coventry,
they'd just built their own theatre,

53:36.480 --> 53:40.840
the first civic theatre
ever built in the country.

53:40.960 --> 53:45.480
They called it the Belgrade Theatre.
And there they did fortnightly rep.

53:46.280 --> 53:49.200
Which meant they had two weeks
rehearsal, which meant...

53:49.960 --> 53:53.480
..which meant they were bound to
be twice as good.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.800
And I applied and I was accepted.

53:56.920 --> 54:01.080
And so started my apprenticeship
as a professional actor.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.800
I have to confess...

54:04.600 --> 54:08.760
..that having just enjoyed sex
for the first time at Cambridge,

54:08.880 --> 54:10.840
I wanted to go to the British theatre

54:10.960 --> 54:14.560
because I'd heard that it was possible
to meet other queers there.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.560
And it is.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.400
[LAUGHTER]

54:27.560 --> 54:31.280
And so I signed up for a year
at the Belgrade in Coventry.

54:31.400 --> 54:35.040
Eight pounds ten shillings a week ― three
guineas of that covered the cost of digs.

54:35.840 --> 54:38.200
And the contract said "play as cast",

54:38.320 --> 54:42.120
which means you have to do any part
that you're given, and that suited me.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.840
Here's the first play
than I did professionally.

54:45.360 --> 54:49.760
Of course it was a revival of
Robert Bolt's A Man For All Seasons.

54:49.880 --> 54:52.760
I played Roper,
the son-in-law of the main character.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.400
Then we did Shakespeare,
Much Ado About Nothing.

54:56.520 --> 55:01.680
I was cast as Claudio,
which is a dreadful part.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.600
Bernard Shaw, Plays Pleasant,

55:05.720 --> 55:09.240
You Never Can Tell.
I played one of the twins.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.840
Anton Chekhov, The Seagull.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.080
Toad of Toad Hall. Chief weasel.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.120
Yes, Charles Dickens, Pickwick Papers.
Mr Snodgrass.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.360
There were 17 of these plays,
two of them...

55:25.480 --> 55:27.960
had been written especially for us ―
they were world premieres.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.960
That's the last play that we did ―
Andre Obey, Noah.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.160
Oh, and that one.

55:35.840 --> 55:38.000
The Bride Comes Back.

55:38.680 --> 55:41.720
By Ronald Millar.
It says here on the cover,

55:41.840 --> 55:44.400
rather optimistically, "a comedy".

55:52.200 --> 55:53.640
After he'd finished writing plays,

55:53.760 --> 55:56.280
Ronald Millar started to write
political speeches,

55:56.400 --> 55:59.720
and he invented for Mrs Thatcher
that famous quip,

55:59.840 --> 56:02.120
"The lady's not for turning".

56:02.240 --> 56:05.360
I wish there'd been a few jokes
as good as that in the play.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.880
And then of course we had to
do an Agatha Christie.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.160
And...yeah, here it is.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.240
Which play by Agatha Christie is that?

[SCATTERED COMMENTS FROM AUDIENCE]

56:26.240 --> 56:28.360
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Black...

56:29.000 --> 56:30.840
Black Coffee, did you say?

56:30.960 --> 56:32.680

56:33.160 --> 56:36.080
Did you say Black Coffee? Yes.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.280
Have you ever seen it?

56:40.120 --> 56:41.360
No?

56:41.880 --> 56:43.160
Well, I've been in it.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.880
[LAUGHTER]

56:48.280 --> 56:51.720
Oh, let me tell you about Black Coffee.

56:51.840 --> 56:54.360
At the end of Act I of the play,

56:54.480 --> 56:57.200
the master of the household
comes down from supper,

56:57.320 --> 57:01.160
and he's sitting there surrounded by
potential murderers and victims.

57:01.280 --> 57:04.280
And I'm 22 years old,
playing the ancient retainer,

57:04.400 --> 57:08.000
who has to carry the fatal cup
of black coffee over to him.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.520
And I decide
that my man's going to be old.

57:10.640 --> 57:15.600
No, no, no, really, really old...
like, 80.

57:15.720 --> 57:17.400
[LAUGHTER]

57:24.640 --> 57:28.000
I put a pale Leichner base on
and squeezed the end of my greasepaints

57:28.120 --> 57:31.160
to get a lake, and put lines and wrinkles,
brown shading,

57:31.280 --> 57:33.760
half a pound of self-raising flour
on my head.

57:33.880 --> 57:38.280
And across the stage I go,
walking like 80-year-olds always do.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.160
Look, I was doing this sort of thing
long before Julie Walters.

57:58.480 --> 58:00.720
And then the master of the household...

58:02.000 --> 58:04.200
..has the deathless line...

58:08.280 --> 58:10.880
"This coffee is very bitter."

58:22.160 --> 58:24.920
Gus is the cat from the theatre door.

58:25.040 --> 58:27.240
His name, as I ought
to have told you before,

58:27.360 --> 58:31.320
is really Aspara-gus,
but that's such a fuss to pronounce

58:31.440 --> 58:34.400
that they usually call him just Gus.

58:34.520 --> 58:36.760
His coat's very shabby.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.920
He's thin as a rake.
He suffers from palsy...

58:41.200 --> 58:43.480
..which makes his paw shake.

58:44.080 --> 58:47.160
Yet he was in his youth
quite the smartest of cats,

58:47.280 --> 58:49.960
though no longer a terror to mice or rats,

58:50.080 --> 58:52.640
for he isn't the cat
that he was in his prime.

58:52.760 --> 58:57.480
Though his name was quite famous,
he says, in his time.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.880
And whenever
he joins his friends at their club,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.680
which takes place
at the back of a neighbouring pub,

59:03.800 --> 59:07.480
he loves to regale them,

his success on the Halls,

59:27.680 --> 59:32.120
when the gallery
once gave him seven calls.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.000
But his grandest creation

59:34.120 --> 59:35.800
As he loves to tell

59:35.920 --> 59:39.760
Was Firefrorefiddle

59:39.880 --> 59:44.240
The Fiend of the Fell.

59:44.360 --> 59:48.200
He has played, so he says,
every possible part

59:48.320 --> 59:52.000
and I used to know 70 speeches by heart.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.760
I'd extemporise backchat.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.800
Meow! Me-ooow!

59:56.920 --> 59:59.040
I knew how to gag.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:03.680
And I knew
how to let the cat out of the bag.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:09.640
I have sat by the bedside
of poor Little Nell

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:13.400
When the curfew was rung,
then I swung on the bell.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:16.200
In the pantomime season I never fell flat,

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:18.400
And I once understudied

1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:20.640
Dick Whittington's Cat.

1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:25.440
But my grandest creation,
as he loves to tell

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.440
Was Firefrorefiddle...

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:33.320
The Fiend of the Fell.

Then if someone will give him
a toothful of gin

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:39.840
He will tell how he once
played a part in East Lynne

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:43.040
In a Shakespeare performance
he once came on pat

1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:46.520
When some actor
suggested the need for a cat

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:51.040
And he says, now these kittens,
they do not get trained

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:55.480
As we did in the days
when Victoria reigned

1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:58.160
They do not get drilled
in a regular troupe

1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:01.440
And they think it is smart
just to jump through a hoop

1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:05.840
And he says,
as he scratches himself with his claws

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:11.840
Well, the theatre
is certainly not what it was.

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:14.720
These modern productions
are all very well

1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:19.160
But nothing can equal,
from what I hear tell

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:22.720
That moment of mystery

Thank you very much!

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:01.040
Words by TS Eliot,

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:04.480
and a little bit of the music
by AL Webber.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:07.520
And in the film,

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:11.960
Cats The Musical, I got to play Gus.

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.880
And do you remember
who was Old Deuteronomy?

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.840
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Judi Dench.
― Yes, young Judi Dench.

1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:23.480
Oh, I loved seeing her
all curled up in her cat basket.

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.240
Judi and I have worked together
on many happy occasions.

1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:32.880
Never more so than when
we've been in the company together,

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.960
because like me, she started off in rep.

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:41.800
And after the Belgrade in Coventry,
I moved a little bit further north

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:46.680
to the New Playhouse in Nottingham.

1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:51.520
And we opened it up.
Another new civic theatre.

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:55.120
Oh, and the excitement of the first night.
There were flowers and...

1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.160
..and telegrams. One of them in particular

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.600
was stuck up on the noticeboard
in the green room for the actors.

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:07.560
It's a telegram from London from
the National Theatre of Great Britain,

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:11.280
and it was signed, Laurence Olivier.

1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:14.960
I wish I'd stolen it.

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:21.080
Olivier was running
his new National Theatre,

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:26.560
not in specially built premises like
we had in Coventry and Nottingham.

1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:29.240
No, he was in the old Old Vic.

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:36.760
But his planning was based on
the experience of the regional reps.

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:38.960
He kept together a company of actors,

1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:43.200
oh, for months, years,
doing a changing repertoire of plays.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.360
And in the company from the word go
was young Maggie Smith.

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.400
And here's a bit of luck.
Maggie came to see her friend,

1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:55.080
the English film star Phyllis Calvert,
in a new play

1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:57.800
at the Duke of York's Theatre
here in London,

1:03:57.920 --> 1:03:59.800
and I was in the cast.

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:04.000
It was the first play I'd ever done
as a professional in London.

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.680
And Maggie went back to Sir Laurence...

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:10.440
..and...

1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:15.320
..I got the call ― would I come
and join the National Theatre?

1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.320
Because Sir Laurence was putting together
a new production of Much Ado About Nothing

1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:23.480
and he invited me
to come and play the part of Claudio.

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.200
[LAUGHTER]

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:32.600
Well, of course,
I was not going to say to no.

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:35.720
No, Much Ado was to be directed by the...

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.200
..wonderful opera and film director
Franco Zeffirelli.

1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:43.720
And Maggie was to be Beatrice

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.880
and her then husband,
Robert Stephens, Benedick.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.280
And I had joined the most prestigious
rep company in the country,

1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:53.200
if not the world.

1:04:56.800 --> 1:04:59.680
Oh, there was just one thing.

1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:05.240
Listen to who else was in that company
at the same time.

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:08.440

of my gender and my generation.

Edward Hardwicke, Ronald Pickup,

Michael Burke, Michael York, Frank Finlay.

1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:29.640
And the most famous and glamorous
young acts of the time,

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.680
Albert Finney.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:33.360
We were all...

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:36.880
..in the company at the same time.

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.600
And you know, today
the National Theatre of Great Britain

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.840
doesn't have an acting company.

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:45.440
Nor does any other theatre in the country.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.280
With one exception, and we went
to visit them on the tour in Scotland.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.720
There we are ― Dundee Rep.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:06:00.440
The one theatre in the country
that still has the old system.

1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:05.480
And I thought,
if I'm going to have to stand in line

1:06:05.600 --> 1:06:07.840
behind that queue of talent,

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:11.120
I'm never going to get anywhere
at the National Theatre, so...

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:14.200
I handed in my notice
after only nine months.

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:16.600
And Sir Laurence was not best pleased.

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:20.480
You know he had a rather flowery
turn of phrase.

1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:23.760
And he said, "I am haunted...

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:31.720
"..by the spectre of lost opportunity."

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:35.040
Well, he needn't have worried too much.

1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:38.560
I fell in with a touring troupe
of players, Prospect,

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:42.720
who did the classics, mainly,
around the country and...

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.040
..they were doing
a play by Christopher Marlowe,

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.520
an exact contemporary of Shakespeare's.

1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:51.320
And his play, King Edward II,

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:56.640
which I think is the first play ever
in the English language

1:06:56.760 --> 1:07:02.280
to have a gay hero at the centre,
and they asked me to play King Edward.

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:05.200
And all was well and off we went.

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:11.600
Until we reach
the Edinburgh International Festival,

1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:15.600
where we found ourselves
doing the first gay play ever written

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:19.560
on the temporary stage of the
Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland.

1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:25.960
And, uh...

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:30.920
To the first night came a local
councillor, Councillor John Kidd,

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:35.200
and he was (SCOTTISH ACCENT) appalled
at the sight of two actors ―

1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:37.120
that would be Jimmy Laurenson and me ―

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:38.400
kissing!

1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:40.880
He complained
to the local Watch Committee.

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.600
He was determined he was going to
close down our production.

1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:46.600
And so they sent
to the second performance,

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:50.360
to judge whether we would be allowed
to continue or not,

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:51.560
two policemen,

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:53.880
who sat on the front row in full uniform.

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:00.240
And...they seemed to enjoy it.

1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:07.080
And...they stayed right through to the end
and they started the standing ovation.

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:10.640
And that was the last
that we heard of that.

when it was still illegal
for two men to make love in Scotland.

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:46.960
And my boyfriend Brian and I
broke the law most nights.

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:53.639
Brian was a history teacher
at a secondary modern school

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:57.319
here in London, in Shepherd's Bush,
and we lived close by. We had...

1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:00.559
..gay friends and straight friends. We
always went out together as a couple,

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:02.479
but of course, we'd never show

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.960
any affection towards each other in
public. That would have been dangerous.

1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:12.000
Had anyone discovered that Brian was gay,
he could have been sacked as a teacher.

1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:15.000
Not me ― I'm fine as an actor ―
but I'm so busy enjoying myself,

1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.399
I don't really notice that the law
is discriminating against me.

1:09:21.719 --> 1:09:24.360
And I don't speak publicly
about being gay.

1:09:24.479 --> 1:09:29.120
I'm what the Americans
would call...I was in the closet.

1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:33.440
And the closet is not
a glamorous place to be.

1:09:33.559 --> 1:09:36.040
We would say I was living in a cupboard,

1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.040
and you cannot live in a cupboard,
unless of course, you're a skeleton.

1:09:42.559 --> 1:09:44.639
And this went on.

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:51.120
Even when I was doing a world premiere
at the Royal Court Theatre.

1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.080
Martin Sherman's sensational Bent,

1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:59.840
which educated the world
on the ill-treatment of gay people...

1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:04.520
..in the labour camps
of the Third Reich under Adolf Hitler.

1:10:04.639 --> 1:10:07.639
I remember saying to a journalist
at the time, "Oh, Bent...

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.960
"It's not a play about gay rights.
No, it's a play about human rights."

1:10:14.559 --> 1:10:16.559
As if there were a difference.

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:20.280
I couldn't quite bring myself
to be honest.

1:10:23.559 --> 1:10:25.360
And then I woke up.

1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:31.120
The government was introducing
a nasty, short brutish law

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:32.840
called Section 28.

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:35.080
If you don't know what that is, Google it.
You won't believe it.

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.120
Section 28...

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.320
..would make it illegal for any teacher
in a state-maintained school

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.639
to say anything positive
about homosexuality in the classroom.

1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:50.680
Keep the kids in the dark.

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:52.600
Lie if necessary.

1:10:52.719 --> 1:10:55.600
Do not prepare them
for the world outside.

1:10:55.719 --> 1:10:56.960
And I took this personally.

1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:02.080
And did I get angry.
I went on the marches and I...

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.480
..signed petitions, wrote letters,
banged on doors.

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:07.719
And I debated the issue on radio

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:10.200
with a man who thought
Section 28 was a jolly good idea.

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:14.800
He was the editor of the Sunday Telegraph,
Peregrine Worsthorne.

1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:16.480
And...

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.520
..he said to me
in the course of our discussion,

1:11:18.639 --> 1:11:20.719
"Do you know, McKellen, these queers,

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:23.639
"they congregate
in the West End of London.

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.080
"In their own private clubs."

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.080
And I said,
"Oh, do you mean like the Garrick Club?"

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.080
Which is an ultra-respectable
gentlemen's club

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.960
that I knew Peregrine Worsthorne
was a member of.

1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.280
I said, "Look, we can stop
talking about "them".

1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:47.240
"You're talking about me. I'm gay."

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:50.760
And that was it.

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:52.520
I was out.

1:11:52.639 --> 1:11:54.240
And the weight...

1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:57.000
..that fell...

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:01.559
I hadn't known it was there.

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:03.880
And like everybody else who comes out,

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.840
I joined the human race.

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:09.680
And this broadcast was going to go out
just two days later.

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:13.639
Which meant that I'd just got two days
to nip up to the Lake District

1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:19.080
to have a long a...long overdue chat
with my 80-year-old stepmother Gladys.

1:12:23.559 --> 1:12:26.639
Gladys was five feet one inches tall.

1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:31.639
She was from Birkenhead. She'd done
her early theatre-going in Liverpool

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:35.040
at the Royal Court and the Playhouse.

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:39.040
So we had that in common.
And we both liked dogs.

1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:41.440
She was a Quaker. Good woman.

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:46.600
And the day... Oh, it was just...

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:49.400
..blue...blue.

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:55.760
And I drove Gladys out to my
favourite spot, the Langdale Pikes.

1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.880
Stopped the car, wound down the windows.

1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:01.840
And we could hear the birds tweeting
and the Herdwick sheep bleating.

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:05.240
"Look, Gladys, there's something
that I want to...

1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:08.040
"that I ought to have...
that I've always been meaning to...

1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.120
"You know I've just been to San Francisco?

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:17.200
"Yeah, well...

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:21.000
"I met there Armistead Maupin.
You know, the man who wrote

1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:23.000
"Tales of the City that you like so much.

1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:26.200
"Well, it turns out
Armistead Maupin lives with his partner,

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:32.320
"who is a man. Turns out that
Armistead Maupin is actually gay.

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:34.200
"And..."

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:37.520
And I'm...

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:42.200
..stammering and sweating.
I'm 47 years old

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:45.600
and I can't tell the woman
I love most in the world.

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:47.960
And eventually I just blurt it out.

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:50.440
"Gladys, I'm trying to tell you I'm gay."

1:13:52.719 --> 1:13:54.440
And she said, "Oh, Ian!

1:13:54.559 --> 1:13:56.240
"I thought you were going to tell me
something really dreadful.

1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.120
"I've known that for 35 years."

1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:00.800
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

1:14:07.639 --> 1:14:10.719
Well, you know, 35 wasted years,
but except from that moment,

1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:12.360
Gladys and Ian...

1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.920
..best pals. And, wasn't I lucky,
she went on for another 20 years.

1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:21.880
She was over 100, and I got to
take her to Buckingham Palace.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:29.920
Have you ever been?

1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:31.240
[LAUGHTER]

1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:35.080
No? Oh, well,
once inside Buckingham Palace,

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:40.600
you'll find that everything is designed
to, if not intimidate, to impress.

1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:45.440
And to my big day,
I took Gladys and my sister.

1:14:45.559 --> 1:14:48.360
And they were shunted off somewhere
quite early on,

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:51.760
I suppose to await my arrival
in the Throne Room.

1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:54.160
And I was left facing...

1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:59.200
..the ceremonial staircase that overlooks
the courtyard there in the Palace,

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:01.719
and at the end of each step, each tread,

1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:06.520
there was a young soldier with a silver
breastplate and white leather trousers.

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:12.840
[LAUGHTER]

1:15:21.639 --> 1:15:22.800
(GROANS)

1:15:27.559 --> 1:15:30.719
And we were shown into this long room.

1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:33.639
It was oblong. It was more like a gallery.

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:37.639
An art gallery, really.
There were Titians on the wall.

1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:41.680
Van Dijks, Reynoldses.

1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:43.400
And at the centre of the hall,

1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:47.440
there was a great crowd of very
distinguished-looking ladies and gentlemen

1:15:47.559 --> 1:15:50.719
who'd travelled across the world
to meet the Queen and get their medal.

1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:53.840
All done up in their Sunday best.
And at this end of the hall, same thing ―

1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:56.840
another crowd of people. And in between,
there was just enough room...

1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:59.240
I think he was the Lord Chamberlain.
..to slip through

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:01.360
and try and put us all at our ease.

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:05.520
"So now, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Buckingham Palace.

1:16:05.639 --> 1:16:10.600
"I'm sure some of you are a little bit
apprehensive about today's proceedings.

1:16:10.719 --> 1:16:14.800
"But let me reassure you,
absolutely nothing can go wrong.

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:18.000
"Because we here at Buckingham Palace

1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:23.080
"have done this sort of thing
many, many times before.

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.360
"However, there's one thing
I do want you to remember,

1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:29.200
"because it's absolutely
vitally important.

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:32.320
"At the moment at which
you greet Her Majesty..."

1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:35.280
(INDISTINCT SPEECH)

1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:38.280
[LAUGHTER]

1:16:46.719 --> 1:16:49.160
"So if we can all remember that."

1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:58.760
Panic!

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:02.440
And then we were led in single file
along the corridors

1:17:02.559 --> 1:17:05.400
lined with Ming vases,
more classical painters...

1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:07.120
In the distance, I can hear...

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:10.559
I suppose it's the Coldstream Guards
playing the National Anthem.

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:12.719
That must mean she's arrived
in the Throne Room.

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:16.719
And then through the archway we go,
and then, oh, my God!

1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:20.280
Oh, here we are.
Oh, look. Oh, my goodness.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:23.160
Oh, look, that's where
I'm going to have to kneel.

1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.000
Oh, there she is.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.480
In lime green.

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:32.840
[LAUGHTER]

1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:49.400
And I stood to one side,
waiting for my name to be called.

1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:51.880
Do you know who was standing next to me
waiting for his knighthood?

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.520
Peregrine Worsthorne.

1:17:57.400 --> 1:17:58.800
It's called balance.

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:02.080
And then I heard...

1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:05.280
"Mr Yawn McKellen..."

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:09.520
And I'm so impressed
by the whole proceedings,

1:18:09.639 --> 1:18:12.719
particularly being face-to-face
with the Queen, I thought to myself,

1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:16.080
good God, I've been mispronouncing
my own name all these years.

1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:29.639
All right.

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.120
To end this half,
a poem about getting old.

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:38.840
Written I think by my favourite poet.

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:45.280
He happens to be gay.
He was a Jesuit priest and teacher.

1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:50.240
And he slapped the words on the page
like oils on the canvas

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:53.960
so they all mixed up together
in an almost incomprehensible way.

1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:56.840
Bit like looking at
a Van Gogh painting up close.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:00.360
Gerard Manley Hopkins.

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:02.920
And, like his hero Shakespeare,

1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:07.320
he wanted to write a play, and
he started one, which he couldn't finish.

1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:13.760
And in the play, there's a chorus
who speak The Leaden Echo.

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.880
In which they bemoan the fact that they're
getting older and they don't like it.

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:21.120
And...

1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:24.320
Then the whole thing spins on a pun.

1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:28.000
And we get the response
from The Golden Echo.

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:32.200
In which it says, look, if you want
to hold on to your youth and your beauty,

1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:33.880
you best give them away.

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.920
And Hopkins wrote,
"Take breath and read it with ears.

1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:46.440
"As I always wish to be read,
and my verse becomes all right."

1:19:46.559 --> 1:19:47.960
I hope you agree.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:55.400
How to keep...

1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:57.280
Is there any

1:19:58.320 --> 1:19:59.559
Any

1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:05.160
Is there nowhere known,
some bow or brooch

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.520
Or braid or brace

1:20:07.639 --> 1:20:10.320
Lace, latch or catch or key

1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:12.160
To keep back beauty

1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:14.920
Keep it, beauty, beauty, beauty

1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:16.680
From vanishing away?

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.920
O is there no frowning of these wrinkles
Rankéd wrinkles deep down?

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:24.360
No waving off of these most
mournful messengers, still messengers,

1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:26.800
Sad and stealing messengers of grey?

1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:30.080
O there's none, no, no, there's none
Nor can you long be

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:32.000
What you now are, called fair

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:33.920
Do what you may do, what

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.080
Do what you may

1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:37.719
And wisdom is early to despair

1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:43.400
So be beginning, since now nothing
can be done to keep at bay age.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:46.880
And age's evils, hoar hair

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.200
Ruck and wrinkle, drooping, dying

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:53.960
Death's worst, winding sheets,
tombs and worms

1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:55.960
And tumbling to decay

1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.680
So be beginning to despair

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:02.440
O there's none; no, no, no, there's none

1:21:02.559 --> 1:21:04.760
Be beginning to despair

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:06.360
To despair

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:10.840
Despair, despair, despair, despair

1:21:13.559 --> 1:21:14.559
Spare!

1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:16.520
There is one

1:21:16.639 --> 1:21:19.160
Yes, I have one

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:20.280
Hush there!

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:22.559
Only not within seeing of the sun

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:24.960
Not within the singeing of the strong sun

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:28.520
Tall sun's tingeing, or treacherous
the tainting of the earth's air

1:21:28.639 --> 1:21:31.120
Somewhere, elsewhere there is
Ah well where!

1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.000
One

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:34.120
One

1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:36.600
Yes, I can tell such a key

1:21:36.719 --> 1:21:38.840
I do know such a place

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:42.240
Where whatever's prized and passes of us

1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.360
Everything that's fresh
and fast flying of us

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:47.160
Seems to us sweet of us

1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:50.160
And swiftly away with,
done away with, undone

1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:51.480
Sone with, soon done with

1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:54.120
And yet dearly and dangerously
sweet of us

1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:59.160
The wimpled-water-dimpled,
not-by-morning-matchèd face

1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:02.960
The flower of beauty, fleece of beauty

1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:05.320
Too, too apt to, ah! to fleet

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:08.320
Never fleets more

1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:11.000
Fastened with the tenderest truth

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:14.680
To its own best being
To its loveliness of youth

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:18.320
It is an ever-lastingness of
O it is

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:22.120
An all youth!

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:25.000
Come then, your ways and airs and looks

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:29.080
Locks, maiden gear,
gallantry and gaiety and grace

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:33.400
Winning ways, airs innocent,
sweet looks, loose locks

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:36.880
Long locks, lovelocks, gaygear,
going gallant, girlgrace

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.320
Resign them

1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:41.480
Sign them, seal them, send them,
motion them with breath

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:45.440
And with sighs soaring,
soaring sighs deliver them

1:22:45.559 --> 1:22:47.000
Early now, long before death

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:51.639
Give beauty back, beauty,
beauty, beauty, back

1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:53.639
To God

1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:57.120
Beauty's self

1:22:58.639 --> 1:22:59.840
And beauty's giver

1:23:01.559 --> 1:23:03.760
See; not a hair is, not an eyelash

1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:07.280
Not the least lash lost

1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:10.880
Every hair is, hair of the head, numbered

1:23:11.639 --> 1:23:13.639
O weary then why should we tread?

1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:17.520
O why are we so haggard at the heart

1:23:17.639 --> 1:23:20.120
So care-coiled, care-killed

1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:23.400
So fagged, so fashed,
so cogged, so cumbered

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:27.200
When the thing we freely forfeit
is kept with fonder a care

1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:28.920
Fonder a care kept
than we could have kept it

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.920
Kept, ah, with fonder a care

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:32.440
And we, we should have lost it

1:23:32.559 --> 1:23:34.680
Finer, fonder a care kept.

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:35.880
Where kept?

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.920
Do but tell us where kept?

1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:39.280
Yonder

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:41.000
What high as that?

1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:42.719
We follow, we follow

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:44.360
Yonder, yes yonder

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:47.800
Yonder, yonder, yonder.

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.080
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:04.800
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:16.559
All the world's a stage

1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:19.559
And all the men and women merely....

1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:20.920
AUDIENCE Players.

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:22.800
They have their exits and their entrances.

1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:24.440
And one man

1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:27.360
in his time plays many parts,

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:31.040
his acts being seven ages.

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:32.920
First the infant...

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.080
..mewling...

1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:38.360
..and puking in the nurse's arms.

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:41.200
And then the whining schoolboy

1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:43.600
with his satchel and shining morning face,

1:24:43.719 --> 1:24:46.400
creeping like snail unwillingly to school.

1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:51.160
Then the lover, sighing like furnace,

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.480
with a woeful ballad
made to his mistress' eyebrow.

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.000
Then, the soldier,
full of strange oaths...

1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:01.480
..and bearded like the pard,

1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:04.559
jealous in honour,
sudden and quick in quarrel,

1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:09.320
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannon's mouth.

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.240
Then the justice,

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:14.639
in fair round belly
with a good capon lined,

1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:18.360
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut,

1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:21.480
full of wise saws and modern instances.

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:24.120
And so he plays his part.

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.920
The sixth age shifts
into the lean and slippered pantaloon,

1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.840
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side.

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:38.200
His youthful hose well saved,
a world too wide...

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:42.880
For his shrunk shank,
and his big manly voice,

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.800
turning again toward childish treble,

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:54.240
pipes and whistles in his sound.

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.080
Last scene of all,
that ends this strange eventful history,

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.280
is second childishness...

1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.440
..and mere oblivion, sans eyes,

1:26:04.559 --> 1:26:06.120
sans teeth...

1:26:06.719 --> 1:26:08.360
..sans taste...

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.920
..sans everything.

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.480
The melancholy words of Jaques
from Act II, Scene vii of As You Like It,

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.280
a play by William Shakespeare
which I've never been in.

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.400
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.320
I've got into the habit of going
to the stage door during the interval

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.920
to get a bit of fresh air,
and I was doing that in East Anglia,

1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:42.440
when we were
at the Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich,

1:26:42.559 --> 1:26:43.719
and I'm just standing there
and the girl...

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.320
I think she was delivering
pizzas or something.

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.120
And she caught sight of me and said,

1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:50.040
"Oh, I know you.

1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:52.960
"You're from Harry Potter!"

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.840
I said, "I'm sorry, love, you've got
the wrong wizard. I pay the real wizard."

1:27:09.639 --> 1:27:12.360
Of course she thought
she'd seen Michael Gambon.

1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:15.840
I did once ask Mike
if he ever got mistaken for me.

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:18.360
"Oh, yes," he said,

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:19.719
"the whole time, they bring me

1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:22.639
"their wretched eight-by-ten
photographs of Gandalf."

1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:24.880
I said, "What do you do?"

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.400
He said, "Oh, I just sign your name."

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:28.680
[LAUGHTER]

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:37.200
Well, I just hope he spells it correctly.

1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:39.120
So there we are. That's As You Like It.

1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:45.120
That's one of 37 plays which Shakespeare
wrote. And guess what? In here...

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.960
I've got the other 36.

1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:49.040
So...

1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.280
There we are. Those are the...

1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:55.280
..the Roman plays ―
plays that are set in Italy.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.960
I think there's one of them
set in Greece as well.

1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:02.559
Then we've got the four last plays
that he wrote ― the late plays.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.240
The two so-called "problem plays".

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.080
Look at all those tragedies.

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.719
No, no, comedies, rather, he wrote.

1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:12.040
These are the tragedies ―
just five of those.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.440
All right.

1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.160
All the rest, they're all plays
set in the past ― history plays.

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:20.280
All right.

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:21.480
So...

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:24.719
Here's a challenge.
Do you suppose collectively

1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:27.240
you can remember all the titles
of Shakespeare's plays?

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:29.000
Yes!

1:28:32.719 --> 1:28:34.600
Iljama, where are you?

1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:37.960
Could you name me a play by Shakespeare?

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:40.080
ILJAMA: Macbeth!

1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.920
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:47.960
[APPLAUSE]

1:28:52.680 --> 1:28:54.880
Well done.
No, that's a play by Shakespeare,

1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.040
and a very good one too,
and a lucky play for me.

1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:00.360
But for a lot of actors,
it's thought not to be.

1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:03.400
It's a play so unlucky
that we won't say the title.

1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:05.320
Do you know what I'm referring to?

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:06.880
AUDIENCE: The Scottish Play.

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.320
The Scottish play. Thank you.

1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.920
Yes, that's what we call it.

1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:13.760
And we will not mention the title
backstage or quote it.

1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:15.200
Oh, all hell breaks loose.

1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:16.760
Why is it...

1:29:17.559 --> 1:29:21.800
..so unlucky? Well, it's nothing
to do with the supernatural, I think.

1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:25.240
It's because ― could be ―

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:29.800
the play is perhaps the most popular play
he wrote with audiences.

1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:31.800
It's short.

1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:35.280
And...

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:39.800
..it's a thriller, and whenever
you put The Scottish Play on,

1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:41.600
an audience always turns up to see it.

1:29:41.719 --> 1:29:43.000
So that may be the origin

1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:46.160
why professional actors
will not even say the title,

1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:48.760
because in the old days,
when the actors were touring around

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:50.440
with a bundle of Shakespeare
in their repertoire

1:29:50.559 --> 1:29:52.680
and they heard that the management
were thinking of slipping in

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:57.080
a couple of extra performances
of this play, ever popular,

1:29:57.200 --> 1:29:59.960
it probably meant that
there wasn't enough money in the kitty

1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:01.639
to pay the actors at the end of the week.

1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:05.360
So don't even mention the title.

1:30:06.400 --> 1:30:07.400
Maybe.

1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:09.400
And...

1:30:10.440 --> 1:30:13.320
You'll like this. When we were in...

1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:16.040
..North Wales ― Mold, Theatr Clwyd ―

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:19.240
in the audience was Royd Tolkien...

1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:22.200
..the great-grandson.

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:24.240
And afterwards, he...

1:30:25.559 --> 1:30:29.559
..said, "Ian, this was my
great-grandad's copy of Macbeth.

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:31.160
"I'd like you to have it."

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:33.000
There we are.

1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:34.680
So...

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:39.400
OK, up there in the balcony,
a play by Shakespeare?

1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:41.639
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Cymbeline.

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.400
Cymbeline, OK.

1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:47.559
Well, we all know Cymbeline.

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:49.360
[LAUGHTER]

1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:57.120
You wait. You know it
better than you realise.

1:30:57.240 --> 1:30:59.639
In the play, you know,
the two brothers...

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:05.480
..discover their best friend has died
and they weave a quilt of words,

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:07.480
which we often use today.

1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:12.480
So, now for Gladys
and my parents and sister Jean...

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:18.400
..and recently for good friends
Tim Pigott-Smith, John Hurt,

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.639
Alan Rickman, Stan Lee,

1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:27.440
who wrote X-Men, Gillian Lynne...
who choreographed the original Cats...

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:31.160
..Peter Hall, Clive Swift...

1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:35.400
..Freddie Jones, Stephen Moore...

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:39.520
..Frank Finlay, and now, Albert Finney...

1:31:39.639 --> 1:31:43.000
Fear no more the heat of the sun.

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.160
Nor the furious winter's rages;

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.120
Thou thy worldly task hast done,

1:31:49.240 --> 1:31:51.760
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:

1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:54.920
Golden lads and girls all must,

1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:58.960
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

1:31:59.080 --> 1:32:01.280
Fear no more the frown o' the great;

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:03.440
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;

1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:06.559
Care no more to clothe and eat;

1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:09.480
To thee the reed is as the oak:

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:12.000
The sceptre, learning, physic, must

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:16.160
All follow this, and come to dust.

1:32:16.280 --> 1:32:19.000
Fear no more the lightning flash,

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:21.719
Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone;

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:24.719
Fear not slander, censure rash;

1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:27.960
Thou hast finished joy and moan:

1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:31.960
And all lovers young, all lovers must

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:36.120
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:37.880
No exorciser harm thee!

1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:39.840
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!

1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:42.719
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:44.880
Nothing ill come near thee!

1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:47.840
Quiet consummation have;

1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:53.800
And renownèd be thy grave!

[APPLAUSE]

1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:11.080
"Like chimney sweepers come to dust."

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:14.639
You know, the dandelion,
when it loses his yellow petals,

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:17.400
it turn into a sort of puffball.
It looks a bit like

1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:19.800
the old brushes
that went up the old chimneys,

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:21.480
which is why Shakespeare
and his contemporaries

1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:23.600
called the dandelion

1:33:23.719 --> 1:33:25.360
"the chimney sweeper."

1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:27.240
(BLOWS)

1:33:31.639 --> 1:33:33.120
Come to...

1:33:34.719 --> 1:33:35.880
..dust.

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.080
OK. Play by Shakespeare?

1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:41.600
AUDIENCE MEMBER: As You Like It.

1:33:41.719 --> 1:33:44.600
As You Like It. Well, we've had that one.

1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:47.639
Play by Shakespeare?

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.840
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Richard III.
― Richard III. OK.

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:53.559
Bloody good film.

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:55.120
[LAUGHTER]

1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:59.360
This is my street screenplay.
The only book I intend to write,

1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:02.600
apart from the brochure,
which is still available at the...

1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:05.240
And what I did was I put the...

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.520
..the dialogue
as I cut it down from the play

1:34:08.639 --> 1:34:11.400
on this side and on the other,
photographs of...

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:14.719
There's Nigel Hawthorne.

1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:16.840
Robert Downey Jr.

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.080
And then there's Maggie Smith
enjoying a Coca-Cola.

1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:27.639
Oh, and up there,
if you want to have a look at this,

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:30.200
you can get it ―
it's free on my website.

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:35.080
What's the first word in this play?
Not the first line, the first word.

1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:36.680
AUDIENCE Now.

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:41.880
Now, what a word to start to play with.

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.040
Now what's going to happen?

1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:46.600
Now where are we?

1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:49.639
That's live theatre.

1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:53.280
It's here and it's...

1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:54.639
And it's us, you know,

1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:58.680
it's not yesterday's performance,
it's not tomorrow's, it's not the movie.

1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:00.880
Film is a bit...

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.440
a bit "then", isn't it?

1:35:02.559 --> 1:35:04.960
Because the actors aren't there.
It's just...

1:35:05.639 --> 1:35:06.960
Shadows on a screen.

1:35:07.719 --> 1:35:11.600
But here we are...ready for anything.

1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:15.480
Ah. Hmm.

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.559
OK, play by Shakespeare?

1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:19.880
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.480
Midsummer Night's Dream. OK.

1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:23.680
When we were at Cambridge,

1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:28.000
we recorded the whole of Shakespeare
on record for...

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:30.120
..the British Council.

1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:32.320
And all the main parts were played
by professional actors

1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:33.440
and we played the other parts.

1:35:33.559 --> 1:35:36.920
So in Midsummer Night's Dream,
I got to play Lysander.

1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:40.719
Which is a marginally
better part than Claudio.

1:35:42.719 --> 1:35:46.440
And that's another play we did
on record ― Antony and Cleopatra.

1:35:46.559 --> 1:35:50.960
And Cleopatra was played by Irene Worth.

1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:57.280
And I had the very, very, very small part
of Mardian the eunuch.

1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:02.480
(CHUCKLES)

1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:04.880
OK, next one.

1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.639
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hamlet.
― Hamlet.

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.680
Well, Hamlet.

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:12.120
He's one of us, isn't he?
Loves the theatre.

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:17.639
When he hears
that his father has been murdered,

1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:19.400
or so the ghost tells him...

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.080
..he fears he's living in a prison.

1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.480
Who can he talk to, apart from...

1:36:25.639 --> 1:36:27.160
you? And then...

1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:31.680
..then he discovers that it's his uncle,
now the king, who did the murder.

1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:33.800
So the ghost tells him again.

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:38.600
He has to talk to the audience.
Then the actors arrive in Elsinore.

1:36:38.719 --> 1:36:41.240
The players do a bit of a play.

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:44.639
And Hamlet, as we all do,
responds to what he sees in the play

1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:50.240
to his own life, and then off actors go
and the court leaves.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000
So...

1:36:57.040 --> 1:36:58.600
Now I am alone.

1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:03.920
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:13.080
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction...

1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:16.920
..in a dream of passion,

1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:20.240
Could force his soul so to his own conceit

1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:26.760
That from her working
all his visage wann'd,

1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:29.600
Tears in his eyes,
distraction in's aspect,

1:37:29.719 --> 1:37:31.800
A broken voice,
and his whole function suiting

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:34.040
With forms to his conceit?
And all for nothing!

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:37.920
For Hecuba!

1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:41.000
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.880
That he should weep for her?

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:44.160
What would he do,

1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:47.639
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have?

1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:52.000
He would drown the stage with tears

1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:56.400
But I, a dull and muddy-mettled
rascal, peak,

1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:58.680
Like John-a-dreams,
unpregnant of my cause,

1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.719
And can say nothing; no...

1:38:02.559 --> 1:38:04.960
Not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:06.600
A damn'd defeat was made.

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:12.120
Am I a coward?

1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:16.639
Who calls me villain?

1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:18.680
Breaks my pate across?

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:20.040
Tweaks me by the nose?

1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:22.800
Gives me the lie i' the throat,

1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:24.320
As deep as to the lungs?
Who does me this?

1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:25.920
'Swounds, I should take it:
for it cannot be

1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:29.719
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack the gall

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:32.920
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites

1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:34.639
With this slave's offal:
bloody, bawdy villain!

1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:39.800
Remorseless, treacherous,
(SHOUTING) lecherous, kindless villain!

1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:41.680
O, vengeance!

1:38:46.559 --> 1:38:48.280
O, what an ass am I!

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.080
This is most brave...

1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:55.440
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd

1:38:55.559 --> 1:38:57.440
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,

1:38:57.559 --> 1:39:00.840
Must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words,

1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:03.040
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!

1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:05.440
Fie upon't! About, my brain!

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:17.880
I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.800
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.120
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;

1:39:27.639 --> 1:39:29.120
I'll have these players

1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:31.920
Play something
like the murder of my father

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:35.080
Before my uncle: I'll observe his looks;

1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:38.320
I'll tent him to the quick:
if he do blench,

1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:39.920
I know my course.

1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:47.040
This spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power

1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:49.040
To assume a pleasing shape;
yea, and perhaps

1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:54.120
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:56.639
Abuses me to damn me.

1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:03.719
I have things
More relative than this:

1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:05.639
The play is the thing

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:10.600
Wherein I'll catch the conscience
of the king.

1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:17.920
So Hamlet goes on to write a couple
of extra lines into the actors' play

1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:19.920
and he gives it a new title.

1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:21.680
He calls it The Mousetrap.

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:26.760
[APPLAUSE]

1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:30.200
Thank you.

1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:33.280
All right. Back of the stalls, a play?

1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:35.320
(PEOPLE CALLING OUT)

1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:39.840
All right, I heard King Lear.

1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:46.000
Oh, was it the year before last
I did King Lear a hundred times?

1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:47.360
Not for the first time.

1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:49.080
It's that sort of play.

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.280
It's like a mountain.

1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:52.920
You'll never get to the top.

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.360
Although the view from halfway up
can be all right. Look.

1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:01.760
There's Timothy West. He's played
King Lear in four different productions.

1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:06.559
And the hero of my youth, John Gielgud,
he played King Lear three times.

1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:09.400
I saw him do it once
at the Opera House in Manchester.

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:12.680
And a colleague a fellow actor

1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:17.639
asked Gielgud if he'd got any tips
on playing King Lear.

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.120
And Gielgud said, "Oh, yes!

1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:22.480
"Get a small Cordelia."

1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:24.760
[LAUGHTER]

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:35.040
When Gielgud was playing...

1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:36.760
Lear at Stratford,

1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:40.520
his fool, King Lear's fool, was played
by Alan Badel. Wonderful actor.

1:41:40.639 --> 1:41:42.760
He's only got one fault.

1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:46.080
He always insisted on giving
other actors in the production he was in

1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:48.280
notes on how
they ought to be playing their part.

1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:53.280
And I suffered that
when I was playing a small part...

1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:56.719
..with him in Henry VIII on radio

1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:00.080
and poor old Gielgud playing King Lear...

1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:03.639
Well, this was told me by a friend who
was standing in the wings with Sir John.

1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:05.559
"Sir John, Sir John,
we're on the wrong side of the stage.

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:07.600
"We shouldn't be here.
We should be over there.

1:42:07.719 --> 1:42:11.480
"We come out from over there.
If we go this way we can get to..."

1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.000
"Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:16.440
"But I'm hiding from Alan Badel."

1:42:16.559 --> 1:42:18.440
[LAUGHTER]

1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:26.280
Oh dear, oh dear!

1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:28.719
All right. Up there, yes?

1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:30.240
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Measure for Measure.
― Measure for Measure.

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.160
Well, that's one of the problem plays.

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:34.400
It is for me. I've never been in it,

1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:37.840
but whenever I see it,
I never quite get to grips.

1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:40.880
So I'm looking forward
to the production that explains it all.

1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:43.960
And what's the other problem play?

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.080
― (AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT ANSWERS)
― No.

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:48.200
― Merchant of Venice.
― No.

1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:52.000
― (AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT ANSWERS)
― No.

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:55.000
No. These are all easy ones.
This is the difficult one.

1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:56.559
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
All's Well That Ends Well.

1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:00.559
What? All's Well That Ends Well. Yes.

1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:02.160
Hasn't that got a wonderful rhythm to it?

1:43:02.280 --> 1:43:04.000
Why don't we all say it together?
Come on.

1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:07.639
ALL: All's Well That Ends Well.

1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:08.880
Ah!

1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:18.639
I just hope that's true. All right,
so next play at the back there.

1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:20.040
― What, what?
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Coriolanus.

1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:22.840
Coriolanus. Well, I've done that twice.

1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:25.639
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Romeo and Juliet.
― Hang on. We're doing Coriolanus.

1:43:28.719 --> 1:43:31.520
When I played Marcius Coriolanus
at the National,

1:43:31.639 --> 1:43:36.040
my mother was played by Irene Worth.

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:39.360
Second time I'd worked with her, and...

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.960
She said in rehearsal,
"Ian, don't expect me

1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:44.520
"to give the same performance every night.

1:43:44.639 --> 1:43:46.840
"I don't do that.

1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:49.559
"It's live theatre.
It's all about the here and..."

1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:50.960
AUDIENCE: Now.

1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:53.120
She said, "I like to jazz Shakespeare."

1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:57.880
That's what I've tried to do
with Shakespeare ever since.

1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:00.200
And the other great part...

1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:03.719
..is Tullus Aufidius.
That was played by Greg Hicks.

1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:06.840
And that was the part I played
when I first did it in Nottingham,

1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:12.480
when John Neville was Marcius.
His mother was played by Dorothy Reynolds.

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:16.040
That name mean anything to you?
Dorothy Reynolds wrote the words

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.520
for Salad Days,
which was the longest-running musical

1:44:19.639 --> 1:44:22.680
in the history of British theatre
before there was Andrew Lloyd Webber.

1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:27.480
And Tullus and Marcius...

1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:31.920
..great rivals on the battlefield,
great warriors, great athletes,

1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:33.719
and they're too similar.

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:35.120
They hate each other.

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:39.719
Proud, nationalistic, until...

1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:43.600
Marcius is thrown out of his native Rome
because of his pride

1:44:43.719 --> 1:44:48.200
and he makes his way to the
enemy camp, where Tullus is waiting...

1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:50.120
..and listening.

1:44:56.719 --> 1:44:58.639
O Marcius...

1:45:00.639 --> 1:45:02.360
Marcius!

1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:07.160
Each word thou hast spoke
hath weeded from my heart

1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:10.920
A root of ancient envy.

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:15.600
If Jupiter should from yond cloud
speak divine things,

1:45:15.719 --> 1:45:17.600
And say 'Tis true,'
I'ld not believe them...

1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:23.400
..more than thee, all noble Marcius.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.280
Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:30.400
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke

1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.360
And scarr'd the moon with splinters:
here I clip

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:37.280
The anvil of my sword, and do contest

1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:41.520
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did

1:45:41.639 --> 1:45:44.080
Contend against thy valour.

1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.280
Know thou first, I loved the maid
I married; never man

1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.480
Sigh'd truer breath;
but that I see thee here,

1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:56.960
Thou noble thing!

1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:00.160
More dances my rapt heart

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:05.880
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold.

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.760
Why, thou Mars!

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:16.360
I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose

1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:18.760
Once more to hew
thy target from thy brawn,

1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:22.160
Or lose mine arm for't:
thou hast beat me out

1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:27.559
Twelve...several times,
and I have nightly since

1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:30.280
Dreamt of encounters
'twixt thyself and me;

1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:33.800
We have been down together
in my sleep,

1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:36.920
Unbuckling helms,
fisting each other's throat,

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:40.840
And waked half dead with nothing.

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:43.240
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that

1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:47.320
Thou art thence banish'd,
we should muster all

1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:52.800
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:56.360
Like a bold flood o'er-bear.
O, come, go in,

1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:58.480
Let me commend thee first
to those that shall

1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:01.320
Say yea to thy desires.

1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:03.160
A thousand welcomes!

1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:07.160
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;

1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:09.760
Yet Martius, that was much.

1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:12.480
Your hand.

1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:20.559
Most welcome!

1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:27.120
And if there's two studs
are not slipping off into the wings

1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.880
to have a bit of how's-your-father...

― Titus Andronicus.

1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:44.639
Well, you know, it's not done very often.
Have you ever seen it?

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:49.880
Yeah. Well, whenever it's done,
the critics always get very excited.

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.320
"Oh, oh, this director!
Oh, oh, the actors!

1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:55.200
"Oh, they're marvellous!"

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:58.360
"They've managed to turn this rubbish play
into something really quite..."

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:04.600
It's not a rubbish play. It's not
a rubbish movie. Did you see the film?

1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:08.480
Oh, with Anthony Hopkins.
If you think he's frightening

1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:10.920
as Hannibal Lecter,
you wait till you see him as...

1:48:11.639 --> 1:48:15.960
Titus Andronicus.
Yeah. OK. OK. Another play?

1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.719
Twelfth Night.
That's my favourite.

1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:20.920
Can you have a favourite?

1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:24.440
Well...yes. It was the first one...
first one I saw.

1:48:24.559 --> 1:48:26.040
First one...

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:29.400
..that I was in at school.
We did the letter scene.

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.559
And I played Malvolio.

1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:36.760
I was 13 years old. And this copy
of the play has got the famous quote.

1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:38.639
"Some are born great.

1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:40.480
"Some achieve greatness..."

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.760
And I suppose with a reference
to modern politics,

1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:46.240
"Some have greatness thrust upon them."

1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:52.280
― OK, another play?
― AUDIENCE MEMBER: Romeo and Juliet.

1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:53.400
Thank you.

1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:01.040
Romeo and Juliet. Well, he was young.

1:49:02.639 --> 1:49:06.480
Young love. Young verse.
Easy to understand.

1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:10.160
And listen, you'll hear...the text

1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:13.160
is full of light and shade,
light and dark,

1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:16.240
sunlight, daylight, moonlight, starlight,

1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:19.040
lamplight. Colours too. White and black.

1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:22.480
The white of new snow.

1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:25.520
On a raven's back.

1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:29.400
Green of the moon.

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.480
The red of lips and cheeks

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.000
and blood.

1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:38.520
Soft!

1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:43.639
What light through yonder window breaks?

1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:49.840
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:54.120
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon,

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:56.280
Who is already sick and pale with grief,

1:49:56.400 --> 1:49:59.520
That thou her maid
art far more fair than she:

1:49:59.639 --> 1:50:02.120
Be not her maid, since she is envious;

1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:04.600
Her vestal livery is but sick and green

1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:08.120
And none but fools do wear it;
cast it off.

1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:14.040
It is my lady, O, it is my love!

1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:15.639
O, that she knew she were!

1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:21.600
See, how she leans her cheek
upon her hand!

1:50:21.719 --> 1:50:24.559
Ooh, that I were a glove upon that hand,

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:27.480
That I might touch that cheek!

1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:29.080
She speaks.

1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:32.559
O, speak again, bright angel!

1:50:34.719 --> 1:50:38.400
(GIRLISHLY) O Romeo, Romeo!

1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:40.280
[LAUGHTER]

1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:46.719
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:51.719
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:55.719
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

1:50:55.840 --> 1:50:58.280
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:02.559
'Tis but thy name which is my enemy;

1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:05.280
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:07.360
What is Montague?

1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:12.719
It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor...

1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:16.320
..any other part
Belonging to a man.

1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:18.400
O, be some other name!

1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:19.680
What's in a name?

1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:25.800
That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;

1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:29.160
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,

1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:32.160
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title.

1:51:32.280 --> 1:51:34.080
Romeo, doff thy name,

1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:38.840
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:41.600
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,

1:51:41.719 --> 1:51:45.480
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner

1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:51.000
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:54.360
Spread thy close curtain,
love-performing night...

1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:59.520
..that runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo

1:51:59.639 --> 1:52:03.080
Leap to these arms,
untalk'd of and unseen.

1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:07.600
Come, night; come, Romeo.

1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:12.000
Come, thou day in night;

1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:19.840
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.

1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:25.280
Come, gentle night,
come, loving, black-brow'd night,

1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:27.840
Give me my Romeo...

1:52:30.639 --> 1:52:36.320
..and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars.

1:52:38.559 --> 1:52:42.200
And he will make the face of heaven
so fine

1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:47.320
That all the world
will be in love with night...

1:52:48.639 --> 1:52:52.920
..and pay no worship
to the garish sun.

1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:58.280
Of course, there were no girls allowed
in Shakespeare's original production.

1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:01.280
I don't know what sort of lad it was
that was first entrusted

1:53:01.400 --> 1:53:02.800
with playing Juliet,

1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:06.000
then Rosalind and Imogen
and Viola and Mistress Quickly and...

1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:10.680
..Cleopatra. A breed long gone.

― Merchant of Venice.

1:53:23.080 --> 1:53:26.639
Well, that's a part
I still want to play. What's his name?

1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:29.880
― Antonio.
― Shylock.

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:34.760
No, Shylock is the moneylender.
Antonio is the merchant.

1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:36.240
And he's gay.

1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:40.559
And the odd thing is, there's another
gay Antonio in Shakespeare.

1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:43.400
Can you think where
he's in love with Sebastian?

1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:45.160
― Twelfth Night.
― Twelfth Night, yeah.

1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:47.080
"For I do love thee so."

1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:49.760

had a mate called Antonio?

♪ Left me on my ownio. ♪

1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:02.880
Antonio's got the first line of the play.

1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:07.280
"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad."

1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:09.320
Well, we soon find out, don't we?

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:15.400
Well, his boyfriend Bassanio's announced
he wants to get married to Portia,

1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.080
and he's expecting
poor old Antonio to pay for the wedding.

1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:21.240
The cheek of you young lads!

1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:24.440
All right, Merchant of Venice.
Thank you. Next one.

― Taming of the Shrew.
― Taming of the Shrew?

1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:33.240
Yeah, that was the first play
I saw at Stratford.

1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:36.360
Keith Michell was Petruchio.

1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000
And...

1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:39.880
Oh, the set for the show!

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:41.000
I've ever seen anything like it.

1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:44.920
The stage at Stratford
was covered in...stuff.

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:48.680
And at the end, when the curtain fell,
as curtains used to do in those days,

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:50.880
what happened was
they just came very slowly down

1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:52.960
and before it reached the bottom,

1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:58.120
you could see the set started to move away
silently from the audience

1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:01.000
till it vanished in the dark.

1:55:02.559 --> 1:55:04.280
It was like being back at Peter Pan.

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.600
Taming of the Shrew. Yes. Another one?

He didn't want to transfer from Stratford.

1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:21.880
So I got to play in London
the bastard with that wonderful speech...

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:25.440
..about England. Yep. Next one?

1:55:25.559 --> 1:55:27.160

― Julius Caesar.

1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:31.240

AUDIENCE: Awww!

1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:52.840
You know when they locked up
Nelson Mandela? Was it for 27 years?

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:58.960
On Robben Island, just across
the strait from Cape Town in South Africa.

1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:03.800
They didn't allow them any books
unless they were holy books.

1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:06.600
And some wit had the idea

1:56:06.719 --> 1:56:10.400
of disguising the Oxford University Press
Complete Works of William Shakespeare

1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:11.719
as a Bible.

1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:16.080
And they successfully smuggled it
onto Robben Island

1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:19.480
and it went around from cell to cell
and each inmate signed it.

1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:23.120
And against the signature
of Nelson Mandela,

1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:24.760
he'd underlined...

1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:28.040
..a couplet from Julius Caesar ―

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:31.719
"Cowards die many times
before their death.

1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:37.880
"The valiant
never taste of death but once."

― Merry Wives of Windsor.

1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:51.559
Well...

1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:55.680
Shakespeare's full of quotations,
and the quote from this one is...

1:56:56.840 --> 1:56:59.840
"The world is my oyster".
It comes from this play.

1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:02.600
And it's an unusual play,
because it's about ordinary people,

1:57:02.719 --> 1:57:04.719
and Shakespeare is normally writing about

1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:07.360
the nobs, isn't he,
kings and queens and heirs to the throne.

1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:10.040
Here, it's perfectly ordinary people
going about their merry way

1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:20.639
All right, let's do the Henrys.

1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:24.960
Henry the... (MUTTERS UNDER BREATH)

1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:29.639
Henry... Oh, my...

1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:35.920
All right. chronological order Henry...

1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:38.680
― IV, part...?
― AUDIENCE: 1.

1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:40.760
― Henry IV, part...
― 2.

1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:41.960
Well done.

1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:46.719
There's the fat knight, Falstaff.

1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:49.639
I'm not going to play Falstaff.
It's not the padding.

1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:52.480
It's just I've seen
too many wonderful Falstaffs,

1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:57.639
most recently at the Globe Theatre
here in London ― Roger Allam.

1:57:58.200 --> 1:57:59.360
Unbeatable.

1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:01.160
So...

1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:04.240
And then what's the next Henry
by Shakespeare? Henry...?

1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:05.639
― V.
― V.

1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:07.600
There's Kenneth Branagh.

1:58:07.719 --> 1:58:09.280
He gets everywhere.

1:58:13.559 --> 1:58:17.360
When I heard that he was going
to make a film of Henry V,

1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:19.040
I thought...cheeky!

1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:22.440
Well, because actors of my generation,

1:58:22.559 --> 1:58:26.160
Laurence Olivier made his movie ―
we didn't need another one.

1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:28.840
Well, I was wrong.
We did. It was wonderful.

1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.080
And if it hadn't been, I doubt
if I would have had the chutzpah

1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:36.040
to challenge Sir Laurence's memory
with my own film.

1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:39.160
Of course these are
the best parts in Shakespeare.

1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:41.280
The kings.

1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:44.600
There's usually a throne,
and you get to sit on it.

1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:47.440
And then of course all evening long,

1:58:47.559 --> 1:58:50.320
messengers come along with bits of paper

1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:52.120
with your part written down on them.

1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:54.320
[LAUGHTER]

1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:58.880
Well, I mean, that's all right
until something goes wrong.

1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.360
There was an actor at Stratford
and he was playing Henry V.

1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:08.320
And he reached that wonderful scene at
the end of the battle when the stage is...

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:11.440
..strewn with the dead French soldiers,

1:59:11.559 --> 1:59:15.440
and then a messenger brings in the list
of the names of all the dead French,

1:59:15.559 --> 1:59:17.240
which the king very movingly reads out.

1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:22.320
Unfortunately on this occasion, the king
was presented with a blank sheet of paper.

1:59:22.440 --> 1:59:27.440
This note doth tell me of 10,000 French
which in the field lie slain.

1:59:27.559 --> 1:59:31.719
Of nobles in that number
there lie dead 126.

1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:36.840
These the names of those
their nobles that lie dead.

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:49.040
(UNDER HIS BREATH) Well, fuck you!

1:59:49.160 --> 1:59:50.680
[LAUGHTER]

1:59:57.440 --> 1:59:59.800
Charles Beaujolais.

2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:06.680
And Saint-Émilion.

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:12.480
Pouilly-Fuissé.

2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:19.720
Nuits-Saint-Georges...

2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:24.520
Champagne.

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:28.800
Veuve Clicquot.

2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:33.480
Moët...and Chandon.

2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:41.520
Dom Perignon.

2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:45.600
And Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:53.200
So what are these three Henrys?

2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:54.320
― Henry...?
― VI.

2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:55.440
― Part?
― 1.

2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:57.120
― Henry VI. Part...?
― 2.

2:00:57.240 --> 2:00:58.800
― Henry VI. Part...?
― 3.

2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:02.320
And at Cambridge, my best mate Corin,
Vanessa Redgrave's younger brother,

2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:04.440
he adapted the three plays into two

2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:06.320
and he directed them,
asked me to play King Henry,

2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:07.920
and that's how I got to play

2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:10.480
two-thirds of Henry VI.

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:15.680
And that leaves just one other Henry
by Shakespeare ― Henry...?

2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.160
― VIII.
― VIII.

2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:20.480
And what other title
did Shakespeare give it, do you know?

2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:26.760
All Is True. Which is the title of...

2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:30.520
..a newish film
about Shakespeare in retirement.

2:01:30.640 --> 2:01:32.560
It was produced by Kenneth Branagh.

2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:34.200
[LAUGHTER]

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.160
And directed by Kenneth Branagh.

2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:40.880
And of course, it stars...

2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:47.120
..Judi Dench.

2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:52.000
And Kenneth Branagh.

2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:57.200
And I'm in it somewhere.
And, oh, Ken had the wonderful idea...

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:00.640
He illuminated
all the interior scenes of the film

2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:03.440
not with electric light,
but with candlelight.

2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:07.320
Ah! The effect was wonderful.

2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:10.120
Great words too by Ben Elton.

2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:11.960
All Is True.

2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:14.320
― Come on, you're doing well. Yes?
― Richard II.

2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:18.360
Richard II.
Well, when we were doing Edward II,

2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:19.840
I was doing Richard II

2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:21.520
on alternate nights in London.

2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:26.200
But before that, on the road.
Big theatres, 2,000-3,000... No.

2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:31.400
(SIGHS) Too big, really.
It's so difficult trying to make sure

2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:36.120
that everybody in a large, large
theatre has a shared experience,

2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:38.480
particularly people way up there,

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:42.120
who of course haven't paid anywhere near
as much as people down...

2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:43.800
[LAUGHTER]

2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:47.880
But I was a young actor,

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.600
trying to keep in touch,
gesticulating, shouting,

2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:55.880
running alongside the character,
trying to explain to you.

2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.800
People down here
thought I'd gone bananas.

2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:02.600
And the performance
was full of effects, like...

2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:07.160
(BELLOWING) We are...amazed!

2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:09.320
(MOUTHS)

2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:16.920
OK, next one?

2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:21.320
Comedy of Errors? That's the shortest
play he wrote. The only farce.

2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:23.600
Laughter machine.

2:03:23.720 --> 2:03:25.760
Mistaken identities.

2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:27.120
Twins.

2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:31.280
And the best version I saw
was at Stratford.

2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:34.720
As a musical.
And it was put together by Trevor Nunn.

2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:36.440
The first musical he'd done.

2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:39.320
If he hadn't done that,
there may have been no Cats.

2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:41.320
No Les Mis.

2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:44.480
Judi was in it, and so was
her late husband Mike Williams.

2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:47.640
I was in the company but not in the play.
So when I'd finished my show,

2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:50.960
I'd go and stand at the back
and hear them sing and dance,

2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:55.200
And you can still
hear them sing and watch them dance.

2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:56.520
It's all on video.

2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:01.160
Comedy of Errors,
Royal Shakespeare Company, 1976.

2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:03.720
Give yourselves a treat.

2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:07.280
OK. Good. Now?

2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:08.920
(AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT)

2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:11.640
― Say it again.
― Love's Labour's Lost.

2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:13.200
Love's Labour's Lost. Yep.

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:16.560
Well, another play that I did at Cambridge
as a musical.

2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:20.120
Clive Swift wrote the music.
He played the piano.

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.040
Derek sang Berowne.

2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:28.640
I was the old schoolmaster, and shared...

2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.560
..a song about the greatest, longest word
in the play ― one of those nonsense words.

2:04:34.680 --> 2:04:36.680
Maybe the longest word
in the English language, I don't know.

2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:38.920
And it went something like...

2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:41.880
♪ All over the world, wherever you go

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.840

2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:54.000
Thank you.

2:05:54.120 --> 2:05:56.240
― Yes, come on.
― Two Gentlemen of Verona.

2:05:56.360 --> 2:05:57.920
Two Gentlemen of Verona.

2:05:58.040 --> 2:06:01.320
That's the... Ah, where are we?

2:06:01.880 --> 2:06:04.560
It's the one play of Shakespeare
I've never seen. Have you seen it?

2:06:05.600 --> 2:06:08.800
Yes. Where have you seen it,
can you remember?

2:06:08.920 --> 2:06:10.720
― Drama school.
― Drama school. Yeah.

2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:13.920
Well, I want to see it,
because there's a dog in it.

2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:17.040
Crab.

2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:18.760
It behaves rather badly.

2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:20.640
What's the other play
of Shakespeare's with a dog in it?

2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:23.480
Don't say Macbeth ― "Out, out, damn Spot!"

2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:25.000
[LAUGHTER]

2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:32.120
"This lanthorn
doth the horned moon present."

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:34.200
Midsummer Night's Dream.

2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:38.240
Yes, this dog, my dog ―
it's usually a toy dog.

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:41.240
But in Two Gents, it's the real thing ―
woof, woof.

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:42.520
I can't wait.

2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:44.880
OK, good.

2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.320
― Timon of Athens.
― Timon of Athens.

2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:54.400
I can never forget
and I will never forgive myself.

2:06:54.520 --> 2:06:58.440
I didn't go and see Paul Scofield
play Timon of Athens.

2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:01.880
Look, if you hear
there's an actor who you admire

2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:05.280
going to be in a play
that you admire or don't admire or...

2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:07.560
Go.

2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:09.560
Because one day it'll be too late.

2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:14.920
And I feel that
about other great performers.

2:07:15.040 --> 2:07:16.640
When I was on tour in the United States,

2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:18.720
some of the company
went down to Las Vegas.

2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:22.680
I didn't go with them.
So I never saw Elvis on stage.

2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:28.320
I didn't hear Sinatra singing
in the Royal Albert Hall here in London.

2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:32.440
And when I was a lad,
I bought a ticket specially for a...

2:07:33.160 --> 2:07:35.920
..very, very famous local comic
from Wigan.

2:07:36.040 --> 2:07:39.120
He was a film star. He was
on the end of the pier at Blackpool ―

2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:40.920
George Formby.

2:07:42.040 --> 2:07:45.200
And it was a nice afternoon.
So I didn't bother going.

2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:49.320
And I had a ticket
for the last performance

2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:53.400
that Judy Garland was scheduled
to give here in London at the...

2:07:54.240 --> 2:08:00.040
..Hippodrome, a Matcham theatre, and
I called up beforehand and they said no...

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:04.240
..Judy wasn't well enough
and she would not be singing that night.

2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:07.360
And she never sang publicly again.

2:08:10.280 --> 2:08:13.080
Which is partly why,
a couple of weeks ago in London,

2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:14.840
I went to see Cher.

2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:16.800
[LAUGHTER]

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:29.840
She's about my age, Cher,
but my God, you'd never know.

2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:33.120
(CHUCKLES) She's looking great.

2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:35.920
And I loved her line to the audience.
There she was,

2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:37.800
looking a million dollars, and she said,

2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:41.000
"So what's your granny doing tonight?"

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:42.720
[LAUGHTER]

2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:48.280
OK. Come on,
we've only got three left. What are they?

2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:50.080
(AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT)

2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:52.520
Much Ado? Yes, About Nothing.

2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:54.760
Oh, well, I've been in that twice,

2:08:54.880 --> 2:08:58.280
but I never played Benedick,
and I'm too old now.

2:08:58.400 --> 2:08:59.640
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, you're not!

2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:06.640
Oh, yes. I am.

2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:11.840
But, you know, it's such an easy part,
Benedick.

2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:16.520
But you never see a bad Benedick, do you?
It's like Romeo and Juliet.

2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:19.320
Oh, lads, don't play Romeo.
No, you want to play Mercutio.

2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:20.760
That's the part.

2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:24.200
Yeah. Well, you never see
a bad Mercutio, do you?

2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:26.000
And of course you're dead by the interval.

2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:27.480
So you get to go home.

2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:33.560
― What are these two plays?
― Pericles.

2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:35.200
Pericles, yes.

2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:41.120
Well, that's the last of the four late
plays. And they've all got the same plot.

2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:44.320
It's all about reconciliation
between fathers and daughters.

2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:48.000
So, Pericles, a great play
to take your daughter to.

2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:50.120
A great play
to take your father to, really.

2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:51.640
Happy ending.

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:56.400
And talking of endings,
what's this last play?

2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.080
― Merchant of Venice.
― No.

2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:00.000
(AUDIENCE SHOUTS OUT)

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:01.960
Troilus and Cressida.

2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:04.200
And you know...

2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:08.960
I have nothing to say
about Troilus and Cressida.

2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:10.880
[LAUGHTER]

2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:19.480
Well, congratulations.
I think you've scored a record there.

2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:23.680
Well, there's the Tempest ― the last play.

2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:26.920
Then there's this one.

2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:29.920
After all that shouting in large theatres,

2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:32.200
we came to do Macbeth in a small one.

2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:34.160
The Other Place at Stratford.

2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:36.880
120 people scattered around a magic circle

2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.280
that John Napier had chalked
on the bare board.

2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:43.240
Very cheap production. It cost £250.

2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:47.320
All the costumes came from
second-hand shops. Judi wore a tea towel.

2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:49.600
If you look closely at the video,

2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:53.200
you can see on my tunic, it says

2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:55.880
"Birmingham Fire Brigade."

2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:03.680
At times, the play
seems to be almost happening just...

2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:06.800
inside his head, which he opens up

2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:11.600
for inspection and shows you
his fears and his conscience.

2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:14.840
It's not a part to be shouted.

2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:19.360
And doing it in The Other Place was the...

2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:23.200
best preparation possible
for the closest audience of all,

2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:25.200
which is the film camera.

2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:28.520
At the outset, you know,
the Macbeths are the golden couple,

2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:29.720
everybody adores them.

2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:33.760
Single-handedly he saved his nation
from defeat on the battlefield.

2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:36.760
He's coming back
and he meets the three weird sisters,

2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:39.600
who give him
their supernatural solicitation,

2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:42.880
and then in the arms
of his beloved wife...

2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:47.160
..he begins to plot the death
of the good king, Duncan,

2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:51.560
and at that moment, their marriage
begins to crack and splinter...

2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:55.760
..till, by the end,
there is between them...nothing.

2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:04.000
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill...

2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:08.800
..cannot be good.

2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:14.240
If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success...

2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:18.280
Commencing in a truth?
I am thane of Cawdor.

2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:26.400
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair...

2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:32.160
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature?

2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:36.800
Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:

2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:39.200
My thought, whose murder...

2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:46.800
..yet is but fantastical,

2:12:46.920 --> 2:12:49.320
Shakes so my single state of man
that function

2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:51.600
Is smother'd in surmise...

2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:57.520
..and nothing is
But what is not.

2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:03.680
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well

2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:05.520
It were done quickly.

2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:09.400
If the assassination...

2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:17.160
Could trammel up the consequence,
and catch

2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:21.280
With his surcease success;
that but this blow

2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:23.760
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,

2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:27.520
But here,
upon this bank and shoal of time,

2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:32.200
We'ld jump the life to come.
But in these cases

2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:34.840
We still have judgment here;

2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:37.880
that we but teach bloody instructions,

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.640
which, being taught, return

2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:43.160
To plague the inventor.

2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:45.080
He's here in double trust;

2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:48.960
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject,

2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:53.320
Strong both against the deed;
then, as his host,

2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:55.640
Who should against his murderer
shut the door,

2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:57.040
Not bear the knife myself.

2:13:58.360 --> 2:13:59.360
Besides...

2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:02.280
..this Duncan

2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:04.560
Hath borne his faculties so meek,
hath been

2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:07.480
So clear in his great office,
that his virtues

2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:11.920
Will plead like angels,
trumpet-tongued, against

2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:15.360
The deep damnation of his taking-off;

2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:19.480
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,

2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:23.440
Striding the blast,
or heaven's cherubim, horsed

2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:26.000
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,

2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:29.000
Will blow the horrid deed in every eye,

2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:34.600
That tears will drown the wind.

2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.040
I have no spur

2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.760
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition...

2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:47.960
..which o'erleaps itself
and falls on the other.

2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:56.080
Is this a dagger

2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:01.080
which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?

2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:02.360
Come...

2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:06.680
..let me clutch thee.

2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:09.720
I have thee not...

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:12.680
..and yet I see thee still.

2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.200
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight?

2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:18.960
Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,

2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:21.920
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:30.400
I see thee still, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.

2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:34.600
Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps,

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:39.840
which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,

2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:44.600
And take this present horror
from the time, which now suits with it.

2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:47.280
I go, and it is done.

2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:49.160
(BELL TOLLS)

2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:50.720
The bell invites me.

2:15:52.240 --> 2:15:57.080
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:07.080
We have scotch'd the snake...

2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:11.120
..not kill'd it!

2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:18.600
She'll close and be herself...

2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.240
..whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.

2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:30.640
But let the frame of things disjoint,
and both the worlds suffer,

2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:33.920
Ere we will eat our meal in fear...

2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:39.480
..and sleep in the affliction
of these terrible dreams

2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:42.480
That shake us nightly:
better be with the dead,

2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:45.160
Whom we, to gain our peace,
have sent to peace,

2:16:45.279 --> 2:16:50.760
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy.

2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:53.000
Duncan's in his grave;

2:16:53.119 --> 2:16:58.799
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:00.480
Nor steel, nor poison,

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.360
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:16.160
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

2:17:19.439 --> 2:17:22.320
The time has been,
my senses would have cool'd

2:17:22.439 --> 2:17:25.959
To hear a night-shriek;
and my fell of hair

2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:32.639
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't:

2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:37.959
I have supp'd full with horrors;

2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:42.200
Direness, familiar
to my slaughterous thoughts

2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:46.279
Cannot once start me.

2:17:51.119 --> 2:17:53.200
Wherefore was that cry?

2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:57.200
The queen, my lord, is dead.

2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:11.119
She should have died...hereafter.

2:18:12.799 --> 2:18:16.400
There would have been a time
for such a word.

2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:22.000
To-morrow...

2:18:24.880 --> 2:18:32.520
and to-morrow, and to-morrow...

2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.360
Creeps in this petty pace

2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:39.799
from day to day

2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:43.119
To the last syllable of recorded time,

2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:49.639
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death.

2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:52.240
Out, out...

2:18:54.279 --> 2:18:56.720
..brief candle!

2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:06.240
Life's but a walking shadow...

2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:11.160
..a poor player...

2:19:13.279 --> 2:19:17.320
..that struts and frets his hour
upon the stage

2:19:17.439 --> 2:19:21.320
And then is heard no more: it is a tale

2:19:21.439 --> 2:19:23.880
Told by an idiot,

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.959
full of sound and fury,

2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:29.600
Signifying...

2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:32.720
nothing.

2:19:38.840 --> 2:19:41.320
Our revels now are ended.

2:19:41.439 --> 2:19:44.360
These our actors,
As I foretold you...

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:51.240
..were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air.

2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:57.600
And, like the baseless fabric
of this vision,

2:19:57.720 --> 2:19:59.920
The cloud-capp'd towers...

2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:04.279
..the gorgeous palaces,

2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:08.800
The solemn temples,
the great globe itself,

2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:12.360
Ye all which it inherit...

2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.720
..shall dissolve.

2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:25.800
And, like this insubstantial
pageant faded,

2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:29.600
Leave not a rack behind.

2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:31.760
We are such stuff...

2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:37.240
..As dreams are made on.

2:20:42.279 --> 2:20:47.080
And our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.

2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:00.840
[APPLAUSE]

2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:15.480
[CHEERING]

2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:27.320
[CHEERING CONTINUES]

2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:37.960
Thank you.

2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:51.960
How does he remember all those words?

2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:54.400
[LAUGHTER]

2:21:58.040 --> 2:22:01.480
It's astonishing,
but most plays were written

2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:04.360
not by one person but by a group.

2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:07.840
A team. How could that be?

2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:12.480
Well, I used to think...
and then I did Coronation Street.

2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:14.800
Ten episodes, and each episode was written

2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:18.720
by a different screenplay writer,
and you could not tell. Well, I couldn't.

2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:22.040
So it can be done.

2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:26.920
And one of the plays
that Shakespeare contributed a speech to

2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:31.640
was called Sir Thomas More. And the speech
is special, and not just for what it said.

2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:33.160
But because...

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:36.960
..you can see it in his own handwriting.

2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:40.680
Uniquely, of all his works, plays, poems,

2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:44.640
the only speech that we have
in his actual manuscript...

2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:47.600
..is this one from Sir Thomas More.

2:22:47.720 --> 2:22:50.920
And you can see it in London
at the British Library.

2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:53.960
It's on permanent display.

2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:56.760
And Thomas More's a lucky play for me,

2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:00.560
because it wasn't performed
during Shakespeare's lifetime.

2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:02.360
I suppose with a Catholic martyr,

2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:04.640
Sir Thomas, as the hero,

2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:06.439
perhaps the Protestant authorities

2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:08.560
wouldn't have quite approved.

2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:11.920
And so it had to wait
till the 20th century, 1964,

2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:16.960
for the first public performance.

2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:20.400
This was in Nottingham
at the Playhouse, and...

2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:24.600
..I was in the company
and they cast me as Sir Thomas More.

2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:27.960
So you're looking perhaps at the
last actor who will ever be able to say

2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:30.520
I created a part by William Shakespeare.

2:23:30.640 --> 2:23:32.840
[APPLAUSE]

2:23:34.680 --> 2:23:38.880
So the plot of the play
is taken from real life.

2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:42.560
The Apprentice Boys of London
are out on the town,

2:23:42.680 --> 2:23:44.880
shouting the odds. They're demonstrating
just around the corner

2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:46.800
in what is now Trafalgar Square,

2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:50.680
and they're complaining about
the immigrants in London.

2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:53.880
Usual complaint about foreigners ―
they take our jobs.

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.320
They wear odd clothes, they eat odd food.

2:23:56.439 --> 2:23:57.920
Better send them back
wherever they came from.

2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:00.560
And that is the cry ―
remove the strangers.

2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:03.439
And Thomas More, who's a lawyer,
is set out by the authorities...

2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:06.920
sent out by the authorities
to put down the riot,

2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:08.040
which he does in two ways.

2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:11.320
One by reading them the Riot Act.

2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:13.760
And then with an appeal to humanity,

2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:18.240
which you might think
not inappropriate 400 years on.

2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:20.960
So, now, the crowd....

2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:23.200
Would you be the crowd?

2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:24.840
Shouting "Remove the strangers!"

2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:27.880
AUDIENCE: Remove the strangers!

2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:29.880
Remove the strangers!

2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.800
Grant them removed,
and grant that this your noise

2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:37.560
Hath chid down all the majesty of England.

2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:42.800
Imagine...

2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:47.840
..that you see the wretched strangers,

2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:51.360
Their babies at their backs
with their poor luggage,

2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:56.040
Plodding to th' ports
and coasts for transportation,

2:24:56.160 --> 2:24:59.560
And that you sit as kings in your desires,

2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:02.279
Authority quite silenced by your brawl,

2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:05.920
And you in ruff of your opinions clothed;

2:25:06.040 --> 2:25:10.320
What had you got?
I'll tell you: you had taught

2:25:10.439 --> 2:25:14.360
How insolence and strong hand
should prevail,

2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:17.760
How order should be quelled;
and by this pattern

2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:20.360
Not one of you should live an aged man,

2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:23.200
For other ruffians,
as their fancies wrought,

2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:27.400
With self same hand,
self reasons, and self right,

2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:29.640
Would shark on you.

2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:35.880
And men like ravenous fishes
Feed on one another.

2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.720
You'll put down strangers...

2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:42.400
Kill them.

2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:45.800
Cut their throats.

2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:52.119
And lead the majesty of law in line,
To slip him like a hound.

2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:56.400
O, desperate as you are
wash your foul minds with tears,

2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:00.800
And those same hands that you
like the rebels lift against the peace,

2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.480
Lift up for peace

2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:07.880
And your unreverent knees make them
your feet to kneel to be forgiven

2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:11.000
And say now the king
As he is clement,

2:26:11.119 --> 2:26:13.360
If th' offender mourn

2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:17.520
Should so much come to short
of your great trespass

2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.960
As but to banish you,

2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:22.760
whither would you go?

2:26:24.439 --> 2:26:28.040
What country, by the nature of your error,
Should give you harbour?

2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:32.600
Go you to France or Flanders,

2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:35.600
To any German province,

2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:37.880
Spain or Portugal,

2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000
Nay, anywhere that not adheres to England,

2:26:40.119 --> 2:26:44.320
Why, you must needs be strangers.

2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.400
Would you be pleased
To find a nation of such barbarous temper,

2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:53.680
That, breaking out in hideous violence,

2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:56.200
Would not afford you an abode on earth,

2:26:56.320 --> 2:26:59.439
Whet their detested knives
against your throats...

2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.439
Spurn you like dogs,
and like as if that God

2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:08.040
Made not nor owned not you,
nor that the elements

2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:12.320
Were not all appropriate to your comforts,
But chartered unto them,

2:27:12.439 --> 2:27:14.600
what would you think...

2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:17.840
..to be thus used?

2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.160
This is the stranger's case.

2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:28.720
And this your mountainish...

2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:32.040
..inhumanity.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CONTINUES]

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:46.640

2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:47.920
[LAUGHTER]

2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:50.279
Because, as Sean said,
you would like it.

2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:53.320
And why am I in the box?

2:28:53.439 --> 2:28:56.000
Well, I'm hiding from Alan Badel.

2:28:56.119 --> 2:28:57.640
[LAUGHTER]

2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:00.400
Actually, I was looking for this.

2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:02.240
Whether you know it or not,

2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:04.800
today we've been raising funds.

2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:09.279
Money ― your money, you paid to get in
and you paid for the brochure ―

2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:12.560
and I hope you're going to
put in my bucket something.

2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:16.400
In the words of my compatriot
from Ballymena,

2:29:16.520 --> 2:29:18.160
the Reverend Ian Paisley...

2:29:18.279 --> 2:29:20.840
(NORTHERN IRISH ACCENT)
I would like a silent collection.

2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:23.000
[LAUGHTER]

2:29:23.119 --> 2:29:29.240
Because the causes are good ones, and
today there will be more to come, but...

2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:32.400
you've been raising funds
for the English Touring Theatre,

2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:33.680
for the National Youth Theatre,

2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:38.040
that brings young people from across
the country to discover the delights

2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:42.480
of working on live theatre in London, and
some of them can't afford to live here.

2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:44.080
That's where your money will go.

2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:48.080
Today you have actually
made two scholarships

2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:50.800
at the Welsh College of Opera and Drama,

2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:53.080
and money will be going to people
who work with blind people,

2:29:53.200 --> 2:29:56.000
deaf people and disadvantaged...
disabled people,

2:29:56.119 --> 2:30:00.200
who can discover the healing joys
of being involved in...

2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:04.760
..a theatre production.
And at the other end of the age scale...

2:30:06.119 --> 2:30:08.360
..friends in Denville Hall,

2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:12.600
where old colleagues and actors
often end their days.

2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:14.200
Thank you on behalf of them all.

2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:16.600
And one last thing before I go.

2:30:17.279 --> 2:30:18.400
Here we are.

2:30:19.920 --> 2:30:25.040
Just so I remember we were
all here at the Harold Pinter Theatre.

2:30:25.160 --> 2:30:26.279
All right.

2:30:27.480 --> 2:30:30.200

2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:38.920

2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:41.800
Bless you!

2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:46.080
Bye-bye!

2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:48.520
Bye-bye.
