00:01.168 --> 00:03.124
NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.918
It was Excalibur. It was just a small cut.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.253
A wound from it cannot be healed.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.588
I can use the Promethean Flame
to release you from Excalibur,

00:08.634 --> 00:10.420
and then I can tether Hook's
life to it, instead.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.928
I'm not as strong as you are.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.050
I've succumbed to darkness.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.222
But our future.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.253
Really?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.759
I found this outside.
I suppose it's not "the Dark One."

00:20.938 --> 00:22.303
More like "the Dark Ones."

00:22.773 --> 00:24.604
Are you ready to learn
what else happened in Camelot?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.639
Aye.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.812
But first we have to take care of her.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.611
Oh, get on with it, Captain.
That squid ink is going to wear off soon.

00:38.789 --> 00:39.778
DARK SWAN: Killian, please.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.951
What are you doing?

00:42.876 --> 00:45.288
You took my memories, Swan.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.953
You tried to stop me
from knowing the truth.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.127
And now I'm going to return the favor.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.212
(CHUCKLING)

00:57.975 --> 00:59.636
By the look on your face,

00:59.685 --> 01:01.721
it would appear
someone needs restraining.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.810
There. No more magic for you.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.566
Now I assume, given my helpfulness,

01:06.650 --> 01:09.062
you'll allow me to go about
my business undeterred?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.484
As long as you don't get in my way,
I won't get in yours.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.484
Oh, I like this new you.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.566
Tell me,
how does it feel to be a Dark One?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.323
It feels like I've been reborn.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.244
Oh!

01:44.354 --> 01:45.764
(SCREAMING)

01:50.402 --> 01:51.562
KILLIAN: Milah!

01:52.529 --> 01:54.030
You're no less a coward!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.103
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
I want you to suffer.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.187
KILLIAN: Just do it.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.482
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: [promised you
we 'd have some fun ﬁrst.

01:58.869 --> 01:59.858
KILLIAN: Emma, please.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.127
Hi.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.557
Bloody crocodile.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.719
Not exactly.
But I understand the confusion.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.345
(GRUNTS)

02:28.565 --> 02:31.648
That's not gonna work. I'm not out here.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.730
I'm in there. lam your guide.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.524
The voice in your head.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.404
Save your speech. I know who you are.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.733
All the Dark Ones in my head.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.742
But it doesn't matter.
I won't listen to you.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.204
What if I told you that together,

02:46.249 --> 02:49.616
I could get you the one thing
you've wanted for hundreds of years?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.585
Your revenge.

02:52.881 --> 02:53.870
(GIGGLING)

02:54.257 --> 02:56.248
That's right.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.711
And I can ease it.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.595
Stick with me

03:02.724 --> 03:06.137
and you will finally do
what you never could before.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.645
What's that?

03:07.771 --> 03:09.432
Why, kill me, of course.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.773
REGINA: Emma!

03:21.827 --> 03:23.112
-|'|| check the basement.
-REG|NA: I'll get the upstairs.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.077
Emma! Emma.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.452
(WHISPERS) Emma, hey.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.583
What happened?

03:35.006 --> 03:37.622
You turned Hook into a Dark One?

03:37.759 --> 03:39.135
It was the only way to save him.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.294
And you didn't think of
the consequences to everyone else?

03:42.806 --> 03:45.422
lcouldn'tjust let him die.
You can understand that.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.464
REGINA: Well, yes.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.134
(SIGHS)

03:49.354 --> 03:50.639
But now we have a bigger problem.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.929
DARK SWAN: I know.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.973
I didn't think any of this would happen.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.186
l was trying to get rid
of the darkness for good.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.651
You can't tell me
after all Zelena's done to you,

03:58.697 --> 04:00.483
your life wouldn't be
easier if she were gone.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.604
l was doing you a favor.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.649
Come on. This is pre-meditated murder.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.193
Emma, there had to be another way.
You should have come to us.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.536
And risk losing someone else?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.532
I thought the best way to control
the darkness was to isolate myself.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.033
But when I did that,

04:13.170 --> 04:14.376
there was no one around
to give me hope,

04:14.504 --> 04:15.835
or tell me when l was being stupid.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.543
Fine. You're being stupid. So stop it.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.961
Right now,
we have to clean up this mess.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.970
MARY: No, we don't.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.184
Give us back our memories.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.849
Your dreamcatchers.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.305
Regina can access them, can't she?

04:31.354 --> 04:33.686
We can piece together Hook's plan
and stop him.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.688
DAVID: I'm afraid not.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.650
The dreamcatchers you said
were in the shed?

04:38.695 --> 04:39.855
They're gone.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.738
What the hell
is Captain Dark One up to?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.696
BELLE:
Emma turned you into a Dark One?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.242
And now you've come for your revenge.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.411
The thought had crossed my mind.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.587
For this lovely piece of hardware,

04:58.715 --> 05:00.706
I think I'll take your hand.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.592
For filling Emma with the darkness,

05:05.347 --> 05:06.336
hmm...

05:06.723 --> 05:09.339
I think your head will do quite nicely.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.680
So what are you waiting for?
Get on with it.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.220
No, no, no.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.016
I've been waiting centuries
for this moment.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.733
And I really want to savor it.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.745
Get your affairs in order, dearie,
for we due! at noon on my ship.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.793
Where it all began.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.375
GOLD: How poetic.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.921
But we both know
this weapon cannot kill you.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.417
True, that sword can't kill me.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.216
But this one can.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.259
ExcaHbun

05:50.392 --> 05:51.427
You have it.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.591
Aye.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.135
Now that it's whole,
it can no longer control me.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.934
But it can kill me.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.727
All you have to do is take it from me.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.610
So what say you, crocodile?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.322
Shall we finish what we started?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.278
Indeed.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.995
Once a pirate, always a pirate.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.961
As a man,
Hook spent centuries trying to kill me.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.829
It makes sense
that revenge would be on his mind.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.675
Why wipe my memory if he was
going to announce his plan anyway?

06:26.803 --> 06:27.792
There must be more to it.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.467
Yeah. Well, even if there is,
we only have until noon to stop him.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.757
And to save you.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.425
What about Merlin's message?

06:35.478 --> 06:38.470
He said this "Nimue" is the key
to stopping the Dark One.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.188
Nimue was Merlin's true love.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.182
And she was also the first Dark One.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.266
DARK SWAN: I know.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.651
How do we find out more about her?

06:44.696 --> 06:47.312
Start your search
with the Dark One Chronicles.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.026
There are many texts that can help us.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.445
DARK SWAN: As much as I appreciate
devotion to scholarship,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.489
there is an easier way.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.658
I am still a Dark One.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.200
I can protect you, Gold.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.333
-You just have to take off the cuff.
-(SNICKERS)

07:03.381 --> 07:04.370
You don't trust me?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.504
What if the situations were reversed,
would you trust me?

07:08.637 --> 07:09.877
HENRY: So it's true.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.671
-You're here.
-DARK SWAN: Henry.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.720
I need you to tell them that
it's okay to take off this cuff.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.684
It's the only way to figure it all out.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.973
No.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.730
-What?
-You lied to us.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.850
About Hook, about everything.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.643
Why should we trust you now?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.027
Henry, I'm your mother.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.319
HENRY: Are you?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.028
Because the mom I knew
wouldn't keep things from me.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.194
I thought you were the one person
who would understand.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.699
I thought you were the one person
I could trust.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.700
So you can forgive Regina and Gold for
everything they've done, but not me?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.368
They've changed.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.708
They showed me they changed.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.250
So did I.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.207
When we first met, yeah.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.712
But the minute things got tough,

07:51.137 --> 07:52.547
you didn't come to anybody.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.464
You decided that
you would figure it out on your own.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.299
We were a team.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.759
Operation Cobra. I remember.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.842
But now,

07:59.896 --> 08:03.104
you just want your dark magic back
so you can do it alone.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.729
And I've seen what you do
with dark magic.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.072
REGINA: He needs time, Emma.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.658
We should really get to the library.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.326
-We've got a lot to do.
-REG|NA: Right.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.871
I have a stop to make first.
I'll meet you there.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.249
Let me guess, I'm not invited.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.752
Emma. We love you, but...

08:26.840 --> 08:28.171
You don't trust me.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.624
We don't trust the darkness.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.634
Stay here and let us save you.
It's for the best.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.633
MERLIN:
There's nothing we can do. It's too late.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.891
The vault has already forged Hook
as its new Dark One.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.060
They went this way.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.557
This way.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.156
And then the tracks disappear.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.608
We should split up, search the woods.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.910
Oh, he's a Dark One.
He can transport himself anywhere.

08:58.997 --> 08:59.986
So can Emma.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.405
We've gotta start looking somewhere.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.488
MERLIN: There's no time.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.658
Of all the paths I foresaw
for your daughter,

09:04.753 --> 09:06.664
I'm afraid that this was the darkest.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.046
We should return to Granny's.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.122
Even without my magic,

09:11.217 --> 09:12.753
I still have enough ingredients
to make preparations.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.755
I don't care how bad things got.
Emma wouldn't hurt us.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.793
MERLIN: Maybe.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.255
But this new Dark One,

09:18.349 --> 09:20.260
we need as many allies as we can get.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.225
Lancelot,

09:22.312 --> 09:24.268
your mother's the Lady of the Lake.
Could she help us?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.936
-Perhaps.
-DAV|D: Perhaps?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.305
(SIGHS)

09:27.734 --> 09:28.814
MERLIN: Lancelot, you should go.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.440
She does have great power.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.234
The lake is but
a two-day journey from here.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.402
It's worth a try.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.730
LANCELOT:
And if! don't make it in time?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.570
Well, then you get to spend
your last moments with your mother.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.743
We were so close, Mary Margaret.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.244
Emma was seconds away from

09:49.339 --> 09:51.125
destroying the darkness
and ending this.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.672
And Hook would have been dead.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.376
She chose love, David.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.506
And we would've done the same thing.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.340
We share one heart because we took
the same kind of risk that Emma took.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.802
We save each other.
That is what our family does.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.686
So have some faith in her.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.229
I do.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.851
Ijust hope her faith in Hook
isjusﬁﬁed.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.825
What the devil am I wearing?

10:21.913 --> 10:24.996
Why must Dark Ones
dress like monks?

10:26.501 --> 10:27.866
Yes, much better.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.917
-I went leather as well.
-Get out of here.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.004
Try to ignore me, but you can't.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.753
Talk all you want, spirit.
I know you're lying.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.797
There's no way
that I can get my revenge

10:37.887 --> 10:40.219
when Gold's in Storybrooke
and I'm trapped here in Camelot.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.342
Well, that's where we come in, dearie.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.719
Might I suggest a Dark Curse?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.560
And crush the heart
of the one I love most to enact it?

10:47.647 --> 10:48.807
No, no, no.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.434
I won't kill Emma.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.890
But there's always a loophole.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.567
Killian! It worked. You're alive.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.894
DARK HOOK: Aye, it did.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.857
After spending centuries
quelling my bloodlust,

10:59.951 --> 11:02.488
you threw me right back
into that darkness!

11:02.579 --> 11:03.739
Job well done, Emma!

11:03.830 --> 11:06.537
Binding you to Excalibur
was the only way to save you.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.707
Right! Excalibur.
And where is my shiny new tether?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.748
I don't know.
It disappeared right after you did.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.203
Ah!

11:14.465 --> 11:16.501
Isn't that convenient?

11:16.593 --> 11:17.833
How long has he been with you?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.800
You can still see him?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.048
Sadly, yes.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.506
I mean, she's still a Dark One,
no matter how ineffectual she may be.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.841
Don't listen to him.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.550
He's not real.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.556
But I am. I'm right here. Look at me.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.806
That future you told me
not to be afraid of,

11:32.901 --> 11:34.061
we can have it.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.813
The house in Storybrooke.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.861
I'm not afraid anymore.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.655
I want it. With you. It's ours.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.862
You just have to want it, too.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.536
I'd love that more than anything.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.080
Killian, look.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.797
The demon's gone.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.678
We can do this.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.886
We can get the darkness
out of both of us for good.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.561
How?

12:12.649 --> 12:15.106
By doing what I just did with you.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.685
By going to those we love.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.700
Rumple, what's wrong?
Aren't you coming?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.750
I'm afraid my preparations for this
battle can't be found in a book.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.501
But this was your idea.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.921
For you and the others,

12:43.012 --> 12:44.877
there might be some way
to protect yourselves.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.088
For me?

12:48.059 --> 12:52.143
I've spent an entire life
running away from battles.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.345
Time to stop.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.101
You don't have
anything to prove anymore.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.728
You saved me from Merida.

12:57.819 --> 12:58.979
You're a hero now.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.982
But that doesn't erase
a lifetime of cowardice, nothing can.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.194
Belle.

13:05.785 --> 13:10.199
I know that I've hurt you
in unforgivable ways.

13:10.581 --> 13:14.073
But I also know that
not wanting me to die

13:14.752 --> 13:17.129
isn't the same as wanting to be with me.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.464
So, if! survive this,
I want to do better by you.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.336
I want to love you
in a way I never could before.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.047
With honesty and courage.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.633
Let me be the man you deserve.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.227
The man I swore on my son's grave
that I would be.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.388
I, uh...

13:37.734 --> 13:39.690
I don't know what to say.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.481
Don't say anything.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.821
Iflwin...

13:47.035 --> 13:50.118
If I win, I'll go to the well
where we were married.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.737
And if you meet me there,

13:53.750 --> 13:55.866
I'll know how you feel.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.338
You.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.966
The Mayor told me explicitly
not to let you through.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.676
Well, then, you're just doing yourjob.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.386
Poorly. But you're doing it.
Kudos to you.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.063
REGINA: Not so fast, sis.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.357
Sister, dear.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.310
Thank you so much
for looking after my bundle ofjoy

14:24.405 --> 14:25.815
while I was off being kidnapped.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.488
But I've come to
take her back now. Bye.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.365
Good luck with that.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.453
Where's my daughter?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.251
Did you really think

14:40.338 --> 14:44.081
after everything you've done,
we wouldn't protect that child from you?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.752
She's my child!

14:45.843 --> 14:47.799
She's also Robin's.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.503
And you will never
take her away from him.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.008
You just can't stand that

14:52.100 --> 14:54.512
after a lifetime
of you getting everything,

14:54.602 --> 14:56.308
it's finally my turn!

14:56.396 --> 14:57.977
The only reason you have that baby

14:58.064 --> 15:01.101
is because you killed Marian

15:01.609 --> 15:06.103
and you deceived Robin
in the most vile way imaginable.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.229
(CHUCKLES)

15:08.699 --> 15:10.155
Is that a compliment?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.992
This insanity has to stop.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.240
Ag reed.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.039
But I don't think it can.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.201
Actually, I think maybe it can.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.045
You know,
when Regina asked me to guard you,

15:28.136 --> 15:30.627
the last thing I wanted to do
was be in the same room as you.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.722
Now that we're here, this isn't so bad.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.471
Put it down, Merida. We both know
you're not going shoot me.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.928
Oh, won't I?
After everything you've done to me?

15:40.857 --> 15:43.815
Fine, but I'd say an arrow to the knee
would do you right good.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.562
And maybe me, too.

15:45.987 --> 15:46.976
DARK HOOK: Don't worry, love.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.152
A broken knee
has nothing on a broken heart.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.946
Isn't that right, Swan?

16:01.752 --> 16:03.834
What is this?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.627
I expected to find you and the heroes

16:05.715 --> 16:08.957
huddled over a mountain of books
trying to figure out my terrible plan.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.042
That's not why you're here.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.219
You're here because
you still have feelings for me.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.175
Oh, Swan.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.849
Of course I still have feelings for you.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.888
Anger, hatred, disappointment.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.063
You don't mean that.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.477
When you tethered me to Excalibur,
you opened my eyes.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.070
And I now see you
for what you really are.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.565
An anchor.

16:34.076 --> 16:38.160
(CHUCKLES) And I see clearly, now,
that you were nothing more

16:38.247 --> 16:40.408
than a pretty, blond distraction.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.992
But guess what, Swan?
I'm a free man now.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.254
And you will never hold me back
from getting what I want again.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.957
Hook... Killian.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.339
Whatever deal you made
to get your revenge on Gold,

16:54.430 --> 16:55.590
it's not worth it.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.965
The darkness is using you.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.227
It doesn't care what you want,
it only cares what it wants.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.771
Well, you're only a pawn
if you don't know you're being used.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.649
As long as I get what I want,
I don't give a damn about the rest.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.523
And you, of all people,
should understand that.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.605
Everything I did, I did for you.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.532
You see, that's your problem, Swan.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.452
You're so afraid of losing
the people that you love

17:19.539 --> 17:21.621
that you push them away.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.500
That's why
you will always be an orphan.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.377
You don't need some villain
swooping in to destroy your happiness.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.462
You do that quite well all on your own.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.762
Why are you doing this?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.008
Because

17:40.726 --> 17:42.887
I want to hurt you

17:44.605 --> 17:46.470
like you hurt me.

18:02.957 --> 18:03.946
DARK HOOK: Mmm.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.623
All right. Enough distractions.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.250
I'm going to go scout our path.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.002
I'll go replenish our water supply.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.797
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

18:23.894 --> 18:26.271
Oh! What the devil is that noise?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.017
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: That's the sound
of the dagger singing to the sword.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.599
And if you can hear it,

18:31.694 --> 18:33.901
that means Excalibur is quite close.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.274
No, it's impossible.
Emma said it disappeared.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.650
Wake up, dearie!

18:38.576 --> 18:40.487
Your lover is lying.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.243
She has the sword.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.696
Why would she lie to me?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.997
So she can control you.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.492
Not that she needs Excalibur.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.586
She's quite good at doing that
all on her own.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.504
What the bloody hell
is that supposed to mean?

18:55.176 --> 18:56.507
DARK SWAN: You, get out of here.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.255
Oh, we were just talking about you.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.428
Why don't you ask her yourself?

19:00.514 --> 19:01.799
DARK SWAN: Ask me what?

19:01.891 --> 19:04.507
Hook, what the hell is going on?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.434
Emma, do you know
where Excalibur is?

19:10.274 --> 19:12.014
Killian,

19:12.443 --> 19:15.401
Rumple is manipulating you.
That's what he does.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.774
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Are you lying to me?

19:17.865 --> 19:20.402
I can hear it
calling to the dagger, Emma.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.781
Do you have Excalibur?

19:26.082 --> 19:27.367
Yes.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.165
Did you use it on me?

19:30.711 --> 19:33.293
What? No. Of course not. I was never...

19:33.381 --> 19:34.791
Then why not tell me the truth?

19:38.719 --> 19:42.052
You were afraid I was
gonna ask you for it.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.925
You never planned on giving it to me,
did you?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.052
I did it to protect you.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.599
You told me yourself

19:47.687 --> 19:49.803
you were not strong enough
to resist the darkness.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.389
Which is why I begged you
not to turn me into the bloody Dark One

19:53.484 --> 19:56.021
in the first place!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.402
But you went and did it anyway.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.652
You were dying.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.446
You know the worst part, Swan?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.070
When your own mother

20:03.160 --> 20:06.152
wanted to use the dagger to stop you
from crushing Merida's heart,

20:06.247 --> 20:07.453
I'm the one that convinced her

20:07.540 --> 20:09.747
that you needed to
make that decision yourself!

20:10.876 --> 20:14.118
There has never been a moment
where I didn't believe in you.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.953
Where I didn't trust you.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.630
But you clearly
don't believe in me anymore.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.424
So how am I supposed to fight this?

20:20.511 --> 20:21.671
-Killian...
-Don't.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.598
(DOOR OPENS)

20:38.362 --> 20:39.818
Hello, Dark One.

20:40.364 --> 20:45.449
Sorry, the, uh, shop's in a bit of a mess
since you sent Merida here to kill Belle.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.739
Forgive me if I don't offer you tea.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.866
What can I do for you today?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.414
Because I assume
this isn'tjust a social visit.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.490
I need help.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.286
To stop Hook, I need to get
everyone's memories back,

20:56.380 --> 20:57.460
including my own.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.163
And how do you plan on doing that?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.880
Zelena and Hook used squid ink
to immobilize me.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.472
There's still some left.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.514
And you want me to use this on him
during our duel.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.307
All I ask is that

21:10.394 --> 21:14.603
you last long enough to occupy him
while I steal back the dreamcatchers.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.226
Ah, yes.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.397
But for that,

21:18.694 --> 21:20.730
I don't need this.

21:20.821 --> 21:24.234
This is where that magic belongs.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.325
What are you doing?
You can't beat Hook without it.

21:29.330 --> 21:33.243
My feud with the Captain
predates you by centuries.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.620
And if! am gonna beat him,

21:35.711 --> 21:37.076
I'm going to do it with honor.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.746
And I will.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.256
You're on a suicide mission.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.175
Oh, we'll see.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.550
But my stakes are me.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.848
Yours are far greater.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.972
Do you really think
you can win on your own?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.227
I know I can.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.387
(CHUCKLES)

21:57.566 --> 21:59.773
Here's the thing about confidence,
Miss Swan.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.236
It's great at starting a fight.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.944
Not so great at finishing one.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.395
Good luck.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.113
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:11.622 --> 22:14.864
Before we go in, let me remind you that

22:16.085 --> 22:19.202
you may have your powers back,
but I've also got mine.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.127
What are we doing here?

22:21.215 --> 22:23.922
Because if it's more lectures about
hope, decency and redemption,

22:24.009 --> 22:26.716
I can save you the trouble.
I've heard it all.

-ZELENA: Miss me?

I told you, once you go green,
you'll never go queen.

ROBIN HOOD: Regina.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.816
We talked about this.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.394
Oh, couples therapy?
I should imagine you two need that now.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.940
Let me remind you of something.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.485
As wicked as you may think you are,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.821
you're not even in my league.

22:55.040 --> 23:00.160
I've spent so many years
doing terrible, terrible things

23:00.796 --> 23:02.787
beyond your imagination.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.420
But you know how I turned it around?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.459
Henry.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.005
It took having a child.
That unconditional love.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.890
It made me my best self.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.013
And I'm hoping that kind of love

23:20.274 --> 23:22.481
will do the same for you.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.157
Make no mistake, Zelena.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.031
We are never gonna be a family,
the three of us.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.278
(CHUCKLES)

23:37.166 --> 23:39.122
But Regina and I have agreed.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.416
You are her mother.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.119
So, against our best instincts,

23:44.214 --> 23:47.342
we still have hope for you.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.515
(BABY CRIES)

24:09.907 --> 24:11.863
There, there, my little green bean.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.279
There, there.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.194
Oh!

24:17.831 --> 24:19.446
I'm a mommy.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.618
(SIGHS)

24:38.102 --> 24:39.091
Henry!

24:40.270 --> 24:42.306
Mom. You escaped?

24:42.398 --> 24:43.808
For good reason.
I know how to figure this all out.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.685
I need your help. I need you to trust me.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.562
-I told you.
-I know. I know.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.609
And I heard you. I really heard you.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.109
I am not asking you to remove my cuff.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.485
Then how are you gonna do it
without magic?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.441
I'm gonna do it with help.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.571
Hook stole the dreamcatchers.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.749
He took my memories, too,
which means I must know something.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.293
If we can get it back,
I can help everyone.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.460
Kid.

25:07.548 --> 25:11.336
No one was ever better at figuring out
how to break a spell than you.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.008
Operation Cobra, remember?

25:18.100 --> 25:20.933
A Iocator spell.
There's one at Grandpa's shop.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.228
All I need is the stuff you used
to make the dreamcatchers

25:24.982 --> 25:26.392
and it will take us to the others.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.398
So you will help me?

25:28.819 --> 25:30.525
I just need one more thing.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.818
What's that?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.441
A name.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.823
Operation Cobra Part 2?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.487
That'll do.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.615
DARK SWAN: Killian?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.168
Killian?

25:57.639 --> 25:58.628
(INHALES)

26:00.851 --> 26:02.136
Dark One, I summon thee.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.067
I'm sorry.
I didn't know how else to get you here.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.062
-You could've given me a choice.
-We need to talk about this.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.441
Do you have any idea how it feels
to not be in control of yourself?

26:14.948 --> 26:16.279
The last time a Dark One controlled me,

26:16.366 --> 26:18.652
I had to watch
as Rumplestiltskin almost killed you.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.282
I had to kneel, powerless,
while he almost crushed my heart.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.623
I know exactly how it feels!

26:23.707 --> 26:25.447
All my life,
everyone I loved abandoned me!

26:25.542 --> 26:27.328
-I didn't abandon you.
-I know.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.165
But I was about to lose you
to the darkness.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.880
When I'm scared,
that's when my walls go up.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.583
That's when I stop trusting the people
around me. You know this!

26:36.678 --> 26:37.929
Doesn't make it fair, Swan.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.844
Killian, wait!

26:40.933 --> 26:43.595
-(GRUNTS) I didn't mean to do that.
-Aye, but you did. And that's my point!

26:43.685 --> 26:45.425
That's not why I called you here!

26:45.521 --> 26:47.807
I called you here
because I do believe in you!

26:47.898 --> 26:49.980
I do trust you to control your own fate!

26:50.901 --> 26:52.892
It's yours if you want it!

26:56.490 --> 26:59.197
We are going to get the darkness
out of both of us.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.990
But we are going to do it together.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.915
I promise you.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.163
I will never try to control you again.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.626
I love you.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.751
What?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.921
It's just I'm usually the one
who has to say that first.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.471
Yeah, well?

27:23.559 --> 27:24.639
I love you, too.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.285
I wasn't sure you'd show.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.829
And miss my chance
to take your other hand?

27:47.916 --> 27:49.531
No, this won't do.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.412
This has to be a fair fight.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.619
I can't have
your surviving family members

27:53.714 --> 27:55.170
blame this loss on your limp.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.973
It's been centuries
since I stood here a mortal.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.271
Oh, you mean when I took Milah?
I remember thinking that day,

28:13.358 --> 28:15.849
what type of sad little man

28:15.944 --> 28:17.809
is too afraid to fight for his own wife?

28:17.905 --> 28:19.987
Yeah, well, I'm not afraid anymore.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.359
I know I have to fight
for the people I love.

28:22.451 --> 28:25.534
Don't you mean
die for the people you love?

28:26.496 --> 28:27.576
We shall see.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.614
(SWORDS CLASHING)

28:32.002 --> 28:32.991
(GRUNTS)

28:39.009 --> 28:40.044
There you are.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.509
We've looked everywhere for you.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.007
MARY: Emma?

28:45.098 --> 28:46.963
What happened to you?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.724
-Are you okay?
-For now.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.435
It looks worse than it is.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.642
-Are you sure?
-DARK HOOK: Aye.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.190
We're ready to get this sickness
out of us. Where's Merlin?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.649
He's inside.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.905
Well, let's get on with it then.
I'll go get him. Wait here.

29:04.159 --> 29:07.276
If you're receiving this message,
then things are worse than I feared.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.703
There is only one person who can
help you defeat the Dark One now.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.411
Her name is Nimue.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.701
If you want to destroy the darkness,
then you must...

29:17.381 --> 29:18.370
(EXHALES)

29:18.924 --> 29:20.664
The Dark One's found me already.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.505
Heard you were preparing for
the worst case scenario.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.712
I'm sorry, mate, but it's already here.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.382
(GASPS)

29:31.103 --> 29:32.092
(HEART BEATING)

29:33.689 --> 29:36.897
Careful, dearie.
That's the oldest heart in all the realms.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.520
Let's cut it open and count the rings.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.271
You're too late.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.193
I've already left a message
for the others.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.193
Oh, they can't do anything to stop me.
Not while I have this.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.696
Excalibur. What do you want?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.620
My revenge. And for that,
I need to get back to Storybrooke.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.701
You want to cast a curse.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.293
It's not possible.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.709
Not without crushing the heart
of the thing you love most.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.334
Which is why I am not going to crush it.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.006
But someone else will.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.709
Someone who might actually
have feelings for you, dearie.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.385
And that's not me.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.212
But it is me.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.632
-Nimue?
-Remember?

30:11.768 --> 30:14.054
I am all Dark Ones.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.640
It's romantic, isn't it?

30:16.857 --> 30:20.645
After all that's happened between us,
you're still the thing I love most.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.610
And I do love you.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.404
I always have.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.743
But you're not really here.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.319
DARK HOOK: Aye, mate, but she is.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.621
She lives in all Dark Ones.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.457
So when I crush your heart,

30:37.544 --> 30:39.751
so will she.

30:43.884 --> 30:44.873
(EXCLAIMS)

30:55.729 --> 30:57.219
Ooh!

30:57.272 --> 30:58.773
We can do this all day.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.642
But until you have Excalibur,

31:00.734 --> 31:02.144
it won't make a lick of difference.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.072
They say the first cut is the deepest.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.401
Well, they lied.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.577
This is it. He put them here.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.040
DARK SWAN: Makes no sense.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.510
Why would Hook keep
the dreamcatchers

31:27.594 --> 31:29.505
where we could so easily get to them?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.466
Because we can't get to them.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.138
He knew I wouldn't have magic.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.634
He's toying with me. Tormenting me.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.220
Good thing the Iocator spell wasn't
the only thing I took from Gold's shop.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.306
Call me an optimist,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.437
but I was hoping I'd have to use it.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.440
Henry, are you sure?

31:47.531 --> 31:51.023
You didn't have to include me
in this operation, but you did.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.358
You didn't try and do it alone.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.738
If you're willing to take
that first step back,

31:55.497 --> 31:56.907
so am I.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.508
I will make it up to you.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.507
Wanna start by saving the day?

32:21.857 --> 32:22.846
(HEART CONTINUES BEATING)

32:23.692 --> 32:25.774
You were playing me the whole time.

32:25.861 --> 32:29.149
Once you lied about Excalibur,
all bets were off.

32:29.239 --> 32:32.106
I knew it was just a matter of time
before you tried controlling me.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.738
And now,
no one will ever control me again!

32:38.874 --> 32:42.583
Go back from whence you came.
Back to your stone.

32:48.717 --> 32:49.752
I don't understand.

32:49.843 --> 32:52.050
Why are you helping him
get his revenge?

32:52.137 --> 32:53.502
DARK NIMUE: Don't be naive, Emma.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.259
Dark Ones never do anything
without getting something in return.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.384
What do you want?

32:57.476 --> 32:58.511
You're a Dark One.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.264
You know what we want.
You want it, too.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.099
No.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.563
-You can't.
-Yes, we can.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.488
And we will.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.617
Killian?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.285
Your revenge is not your happy ending.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.408
I am. You told me that.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.290
If you destroy this heart,

33:28.548 --> 33:32.006
you will destroy your happy ending
along with it.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.378
Oh, Killian Jones told you that.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.010
Your Iovesick puppy dog.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.476
But that man died

33:40.852 --> 33:44.060
the moment you
turned him into a Dark One.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.388
Ooh!

33:50.862 --> 33:51.851
(EXHALES)

34:05.460 --> 34:07.041
Well, I have to hand it to you, crocodile.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.914
You lasted a lot longer than I expected.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.997
If you'd have fought me with such vigor
back in the day,

34:12.092 --> 34:13.628
I might have given you your wife back.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.551
Soiled, but returned.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.256
What're you waiting for, pirate?
Finish him!

34:23.270 --> 34:24.259
(THUDS)

34:30.193 --> 34:32.809
Well, get on with it, crocodile.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.906
There's nothing I'd like better
than to run you through.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.862
But I think...

34:39.953 --> 34:41.909
I think I'd rather let you live.

34:41.997 --> 34:44.739
Knowing for the rest of your life

34:44.874 --> 34:47.286
that I bested you!

34:48.003 --> 34:49.868
Today.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.477
BELLE: You did it.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.805
You won.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.441
And you came.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.813
Oh, Belle, I'm so glad you're here.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.569
I'm ready to do this right.
Put the past behind us.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.695
Rumple...

35:22.078 --> 35:23.067
(CHUCKLES)

35:23.538 --> 35:24.948
This isn't easy for me.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.407
I love you.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.412
And some part of me
will always love you.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.049
But you've broken my heart
too many times.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.502
There's...
There's too much broken trust.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.675
But I've changed.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.725
My heart, it's pure now.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.637
Yeah, you have. And it is.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.477
Oh, my God, you're...

35:53.568 --> 35:57.311
You're the man that
I always hoped you would be.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.904
Then why are you doing this now?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.652
Now we have a chance
to make this work.

36:03.036 --> 36:05.743
I don't know that I want to make it work.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.122
But I do know that
if I'm gonna try and figure that out,

36:10.210 --> 36:12.747
I need to do that on my own.

36:16.508 --> 36:20.421
I have spent too many years
trying to mend your heart.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.803
Now, I need to protect mine.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.258
Belle, please.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.401
No, don't take it too badly.
I mean, he died for a good cause.

36:38.905 --> 36:42.523
I'm sorry. Rest in peace.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.193
It's over, Emma.

36:49.499 --> 36:52.536
I told you I would never abandon you.
I'm not going to start now.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.492
I'm sorry, love.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.454
Once a curse has been enacted,
you can't stop it.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.461
Yes, I might not be able to stop it.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.634
But I can make you forget
why you cast it.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.135
And that you were ever
the Dark One in the first place.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.591
Clever, dearie.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.155
When you wake up,

37:25.493 --> 37:27.609
you'll be the man you were.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.573
The man I love.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.159
The man who loves me.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.003
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Ah, you'll have to do more than that

37:36.087 --> 37:38.703
if you want him to forget
he was ever a Dark One.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.214
I know.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.841
I need to erase the memories

37:53.146 --> 37:55.683
of everyone who knew

37:56.566 --> 38:00.650
that I turned Hook into a Dark One.

38:02.363 --> 38:06.527
Right, because no one
could possibly understand.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.699
Why trust your family to help
when you can do it all yourself?

38:11.790 --> 38:16.409
This is my fault.
I'm the one who's going to fix this.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.955
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
By using dark magic

38:23.051 --> 38:25.292
to add a memory wipe to the curse?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.507
But you won't like where it leads.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.683
Or worse.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.981
You will.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.565
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

39:08.263 --> 39:09.252
(HORSE NEIGHS)

39:16.187 --> 39:18.178
How did this get back here?

39:18.273 --> 39:19.479
Arthur!

39:24.028 --> 39:25.188
What is that?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.191
Dark magic.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.990
Extremely dark magic.

39:45.925 --> 39:46.960
And we're meant to believe

39:47.051 --> 39:49.212
you're gonna give back our memories
just like that?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.461
HENRY: We can trust her.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.045
Can we?

39:53.725 --> 39:54.714
Yes.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.884
Okay.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.790
Emma, what's wrong?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.828
I remember.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.710
I know what he's doing.
I know what they're doing.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.334
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Congratulations!
You didn't completely fail.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.218
You returned from your due!

40:33.306 --> 40:35.672
with exactly the right ingredient
for our plan.

40:36.017 --> 40:39.384
The blood of a man
who'd been to hell and back.

40:39.479 --> 40:42.061
Rumplestiltskin has done
what few can claim.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.811
He died and then he returned.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.853
This pond holds a portal
to the UndenNorld itself.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.691
This is where the Fury
tried to drag Robin Hood to hell.

40:53.952 --> 40:56.409
I thought the portal only appeared
when the moon reaches its zenith.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.112
Yes, for a Fury.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.072
But it's always existed, dearie.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.034
You just have to know how to open it.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.509
(HISSING)

41:30.279 --> 41:31.689
Bloody hell.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.534
That's exactly where that came from.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.058
Nimue.

42:03.980 --> 42:04.969
We're here.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.143
All of us as promised. In the flesh.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.850
And now it's time to get to work.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.607
To do what Dark Ones do best.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.776
Snuff out the light.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.656
Welcome to Storybrooke, love.
