WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.820
- Dude.
- Dude.

00:03.844 --> 00:06.382
- We are out.
- We are out, and it is nighttime.

00:06.430 --> 00:07.914
No wine. Wine is work.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.849
I'm drinking cocktails,
and I'm gonna get looped.

00:09.874 --> 00:11.910
- Let's get looped!
- Looped!

00:11.943 --> 00:14.345
Mm. Mm.

00:14.379 --> 00:15.748
Don't try to hide it.

00:15.775 --> 00:16.857
You are texting your boyfriend.

00:16.882 --> 00:18.617
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:18.650 --> 00:19.685
He's so cute. Look.

00:19.717 --> 00:21.486
He sent me a pic of him and the girls.

00:21.519 --> 00:22.588
Douglas acts tough,

00:22.621 --> 00:24.423
but he's a straight-up
undercover sweetheart.

00:24.455 --> 00:26.091
He's a good dad, which I gotta say,

00:26.124 --> 00:27.426
I find incredibly attractive,

00:27.458 --> 00:29.627
- and I behave accordingly with my body.
- Mm.

00:29.661 --> 00:30.876
Real good stuff.

00:30.901 --> 00:32.454
Real good barf town stuff.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.048
I'm sorry, but you're in a relationship,

00:35.073 --> 00:37.038
and I haven't touched butts with a dude

00:37.071 --> 00:38.472
that isn't Graham's dad in forever.

00:38.504 --> 00:40.106
So, you know,

00:40.140 --> 00:41.876
guess I'll never meet anyone
and I'll die alone.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.144
Should we split a crab claw?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.912
Ang, you're gonna meet someone.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.613
And you could have any man out there

00:46.647 --> 00:48.949
- who's open to hetero sex.
- I have tried, okay?

00:48.982 --> 00:51.502
I am on all of the apps.
They're a nightmare.

00:51.527 --> 00:52.594
The number of ways

00:52.619 --> 00:54.255
we are allowing
the name Brian to be spelled

00:54.287 --> 00:55.755
- is out of control.
- Okay.

00:55.788 --> 00:57.390
Ang, you got to be positive

00:57.424 --> 00:59.793
and believe that people
can surprise you.

00:59.827 --> 01:03.097
What if... hear me out...
try being someone else tonight.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.899
Have a no-strings, random hookup

01:04.931 --> 01:06.501
where you basically play a character.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.239
- You know what?
- Huh?

01:08.262 --> 01:09.238
Listen to me.

01:09.272 --> 01:10.372
See my face.

01:10.406 --> 01:11.374
Hear my words.

01:11.407 --> 01:12.723
I am in!

01:12.754 --> 01:13.910
My girl.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.211
- Yes.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.912
- Let's see what we got.
- Okay.

01:17.546 --> 01:18.848
Oh.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.515
Okay, I could do that for one night.

01:20.549 --> 01:22.318
So could I...

01:22.350 --> 01:23.385
is what I would say

01:23.419 --> 01:25.154
if I weren't in this
committed relationship.

01:25.187 --> 01:26.756
So, you go.

01:26.788 --> 01:29.424
Be an upbeat, fun, positive person.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.994
- Fun, upbeat, positive person.
- Fun, upbeat, positive person.

01:32.028 --> 01:34.291
- Fun, upbeat, positive person.
- Fun, upbeat, positive person.

01:36.161 --> 01:37.696
Hey.

01:37.721 --> 01:40.182
Sorry. That seat's taken.

01:41.909 --> 01:43.679
By you.

01:46.081 --> 01:48.016
That is...

01:48.049 --> 01:50.152
- That is good.
- Yeah.

01:50.185 --> 01:51.987
Too good.

01:52.019 --> 01:53.221
I'm Camille.

01:53.254 --> 01:54.622
I'm a people person.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.125
Work with people.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.992
As a flight attendant.

01:58.025 --> 01:59.961
Well, you've got my tray table

01:59.995 --> 02:01.630
in the upright position.

02:06.034 --> 02:09.003
Well, I'm Xander with an "X,"
like "xylophone,"

02:09.037 --> 02:11.807
which I actually play... well.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.876
Cool.

02:13.908 --> 02:15.076
- Just a second.
- Oh.

02:17.044 --> 02:18.846
Positive.

02:18.879 --> 02:20.115
He told me he plays Xylophone!

02:25.620 --> 02:27.556
Xylophone? Wow.

02:27.588 --> 02:29.691
Beautiful instrument.

02:29.723 --> 02:31.092
Love to see it.

02:35.362 --> 02:36.899
Ah.

02:38.633 --> 02:40.169
There she is!

02:40.201 --> 02:42.236
Not surprised you slept well.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.540
That mattress is from
the W Hotel collection.

02:44.573 --> 02:47.109
Not cheap.

02:47.141 --> 02:50.012
I'm just gonna hop
into my deluge shower,

02:50.044 --> 02:51.868
and then maybe we'll grab some yum-yums?

02:51.893 --> 02:54.283
Ohh. Yeah, you know what?

02:54.316 --> 02:57.586
I am so bummed, but I have a flight.

02:57.618 --> 02:59.253
Yeah, no, I get it.

02:59.287 --> 03:02.091
I fly to Vegas 40 times a year.

03:02.123 --> 03:05.259
Uh, so, why don't you just
write down your didgies,

03:05.293 --> 03:07.528
and we'll, uh, find another time

03:07.562 --> 03:09.631

I cannot have hooked up
with Douglas' son.

03:54.876 --> 03:57.479
It's too genetically close
to hooking up with Douglas.

03:57.512 --> 03:58.813
- Excuse me?
- Oh, sorry.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.682
I'm so happy for you guys.

04:00.715 --> 04:03.508
I mean, what kind of undercover
sweetheart has a secret son?

04:03.533 --> 04:04.852
I mean, I need a drink.

04:04.885 --> 04:06.407
Or food. Or a swim.

- What time is it? I'm all turned around.
- You know what?

04:08.289 --> 04:09.957
- What?
- We're being crazy.

04:09.991 --> 04:12.661
Our lives aren't exciting enough
for this kind of drama.

04:12.693 --> 04:15.072
Xander probably isn't even his son.

04:15.097 --> 04:16.831
That photo could have been one of those

04:16.865 --> 04:18.966

04:19.007 --> 04:20.517
Yeah. There's a logical explanation.

Let's... Let's just go talk to Douglas...

04:22.229 --> 04:24.398
- ...get some peace of mind.
- Yeah.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.400
Yeah, I have a son. So what?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.203
I have to shower... hard.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.071
Wha...

04:33.322 --> 04:34.750
All right, I gotta scoot to work.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.411
We got a big heat wave coming in.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.015
You know, normally we only name storms,

04:38.040 --> 04:40.148
but I'm thinking about
giving this guy a name...

04:40.180 --> 04:42.149
"Heatwave Harry." Too cute?

04:42.183 --> 04:43.817
How about "Heatwave Miggy"?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.221
How about we leave this
to the pros, okay?

04:47.255 --> 04:48.156
Okay.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.961
- Plaza Pizza.
- Vitelli's.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.877
We tipped on the app.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.280
Uh, what's going on?

05:12.313 --> 05:15.015
We're having a pizza tasting!

05:15.048 --> 05:17.685
And how did you children
order the pizza?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.686
- With the Internet.
- And Miggy's credit card.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.089

- Yo?

05:21.122 --> 05:22.957
Pepperoni?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.826
You gave them your credit card?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.693
What? Nah. They stole it.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.929
Yeah, they always pull pranks
like this when I babysit.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.531
They take my credit card,
order stuff online,

05:30.565 --> 05:31.632
and throw pepperoni at my butt.

05:31.666 --> 05:32.933
It's our thing.

05:32.966 --> 05:33.967
It shouldn't be your thing.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.036
Those kids need to be punished, okay?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.004
Jack is gonna get bigger,

05:37.038 --> 05:38.706
and you need to learn how to discipline.

05:38.738 --> 05:39.974
Oh, yeah, see,

05:40.007 --> 05:41.976
I'm no... I'm not really huge
into discipline.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.545
My approach is more improvisational.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.780
I keep it light and unexpected,
like jazz.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.382
- Jazz?
- Yeah, jazz.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.618

boopity-boop-boop.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.953
I know what jazz is,

05:51.986 --> 05:53.688
even though that was an insane example.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.190
Jazz is more like...

05:55.223 --> 05:57.859
♪ Free-dip, free-dip,
bop-bah, boo-doo-doo ♪

05:57.892 --> 06:00.060
♪ Boop-boop-boop,
bah-doo-doop, whoa-ahp ♪

06:00.094 --> 06:02.163
- That was excellent.
- I know.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.531
Miggy, discipline has to be
direct and precise,

06:04.565 --> 06:06.134

06:18.079 --> 06:19.647
What are we supposed to do now?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.983
- Go play outside.
- Outside?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.017
Outside of what?!

06:24.385 --> 06:26.320
See? Easy.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.957
And fun.

06:30.024 --> 06:31.192

06:33.128 --> 06:34.695
Easy. I don't speak to him.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.330
But he's your son.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.166
Well, genetically
we share some things, sure...

06:39.200 --> 06:41.401
you know, full head of hair,
good wingspan,

06:41.435 --> 06:42.603
Broadway thighs...

06:42.637 --> 06:44.738
- but that's where it ends.
- No.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.007
I-I have a million questions.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.410
Were... Were you and his mom married?

06:49.442 --> 06:50.411
Very briefly.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.945
She was legal counsel

06:51.978 --> 06:53.714
for a chewing-tobacco company.

06:53.748 --> 06:57.284
Now, the divorce was amicable,
but brutal for sport.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.421
Look, Pop, I don't want
to talk about Xander, okay?

07:00.454 --> 07:02.924
It was an incident
a long time ago... very painful.

07:02.957 --> 07:04.759
No. No, Douglas.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.294
You don't get to ignore your own kid.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.096
You... You gotta fix this.

07:09.130 --> 07:11.099
Look, I'm done trying to mend fences.

07:11.132 --> 07:12.800
We're estranged, okay?

07:12.832 --> 07:14.469
It's a shame, but that's that.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.271
- Yeah, but, Douglas, you...
- No, no, no. No "but"...

07:16.303 --> 07:19.640
except for your butt,
which I like very much.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.909
They're too quiet, man.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.411

07:26.313 --> 07:27.448

They're learning their lesson <i>
and</i> having a ball.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.556
"Ball" because they're
playing with a ball.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.091
Uh, yeah, I-I got it, yeah.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.793
This is insane.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.796
What is this, 1931?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.833

07:45.865 --> 07:47.635

07:47.668 --> 07:49.603

07:49.637 --> 07:51.305
- Whoa!
- Okay.

07:51.339 --> 07:52.572
Sorry.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.475

07:54.507 --> 07:55.976
Oh, snap.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.745

07:57.777 --> 08:01.349
That iPad isn't just
Candy Crush and "Dinotrux."

08:01.382 --> 08:04.619
It's how I say good night
to my mom at sleepovers.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.021
When you come for my family,

08:07.053 --> 08:09.156
I put your Irish bodies in the ground.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.457
Wow.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.661
Look, I gotta scoot to work.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.962
You'll be fine.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.265
Just stick to the discipline plan.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.902
Remember... pom-pom! They're just kids.

08:23.137 --> 08:25.273
- Aah.
- Just you now, huh?

08:25.305 --> 08:26.541
Yeah.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.309
Interesting.

08:31.145 --> 08:33.114
Hey, did you girls rent a backhoe?

08:33.147 --> 08:35.549
Because they need you to sign for it.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.352
Hello, Dad.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.721
What did you do?

08:46.584 --> 08:49.354
Place looks good, Dad.

08:49.387 --> 08:50.723
Let me know if you want to modernize.

I can give you the name of my decorator.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.021
She did my place in Glendale.

08:54.053 --> 08:54.987
Up and coming.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.923
Oh, no, Glendale has arrived.

08:56.956 --> 08:59.656
It has long since arrived.

08:59.681 --> 09:03.023
Must be nice being so close to Azusa.

09:03.055 --> 09:04.924
Gets hot out there. Got a pool?

09:04.956 --> 09:06.393
Yeah, I got a pool.

09:06.426 --> 09:08.194
It's a community pool,

09:08.226 --> 09:09.595
but you can reserve it

09:09.629 --> 09:11.864
for birthdays and special occasions.

09:11.898 --> 09:13.566
I got it next Wednesday morning.

09:13.599 --> 09:15.033
Oh, what fun!

09:15.066 --> 09:17.070
Yeah, whether private
or community times.

09:17.103 --> 09:18.505
Mm-hmm.

09:18.537 --> 09:21.740
Oh, my God, what a shower.

09:21.773 --> 09:23.942
I got in there, y'all.

09:25.411 --> 09:27.946
- Camille.
- Yeah.

09:32.552 --> 09:34.553
What are you doing at my dad's house?

09:35.754 --> 09:37.890
What strange treat is this?

09:37.923 --> 09:39.259
Um...

09:39.292 --> 09:40.793
Xander.

09:40.826 --> 09:42.261
- I guess you guys know each other.
- Yeah.

09:42.294 --> 09:45.764
I, uh, broke down
on my way to the airport,

09:45.797 --> 09:48.934
and then I asked this man
standing right here

09:48.967 --> 09:50.869
if I could use his phone...

09:50.903 --> 09:53.352
and then his shower.

09:53.377 --> 09:54.791
Oh.

09:54.816 --> 09:57.277
And then now you're here, and it just...

09:57.310 --> 10:00.613
It's... fate?

10:00.645 --> 10:02.147
Oh, I believe in fate.

10:02.181 --> 10:05.317
Dad, I'd like to introduce you

10:05.350 --> 10:07.253
to a special new friend of mine.

10:07.286 --> 10:09.722
- This is Camille.
- Hey.

10:09.754 --> 10:13.993
Well, what a pleasure
to meet you, Camille.

10:14.026 --> 10:16.096
S-So, you two are, uh...

10:17.430 --> 10:19.065
Terrific.

10:19.097 --> 10:20.899
Wait. What's so funny?

10:20.932 --> 10:23.802
You heartless mountain!

10:23.836 --> 10:26.273
You just can't stand to see me happy!

10:27.606 --> 10:28.541
Oh, Xander, no.

10:29.207 --> 10:30.643
Oh.

10:33.211 --> 10:35.481
You slept with my son,

10:35.514 --> 10:37.516
and you used a fake name?

10:37.550 --> 10:39.452
Oh, this is my Christmas,

10:39.485 --> 10:42.231
my dumb, beautiful Christmas.

10:42.256 --> 10:44.157
Okay, look, bringing Xander here

10:44.190 --> 10:46.292
isn't going as smoothly as I thought.

10:46.325 --> 10:48.027
Oh, I-I think it's getting better.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.729
But we can work through this, okay?

10:49.770 --> 10:51.354
Uh...

10:52.132 --> 10:54.102
Angie, can you go talk to him?

10:54.127 --> 10:55.267
He'll listen to Camille.

10:55.301 --> 10:57.637
But Camille was supposed to be
for one night only,

10:57.669 --> 11:00.272
like a tank top from Forever 21.

11:00.306 --> 11:02.542
I'm not sure I can keep up
all that positivity.

11:02.575 --> 11:04.544
Come on, Ang. We have sons.

11:04.576 --> 11:05.979
Can you imagine them not talking to us?

11:06.012 --> 11:06.980
It breaks my heart.

11:07.013 --> 11:08.614
Fine. What's in it for me?

11:08.648 --> 11:09.983
- Whatever you want.
- Sour Patch Kids.

11:10.015 --> 11:11.985
- Done.
- Man! I answered too fast.

11:12.018 --> 11:13.320
Should have asked for a lot more.

11:14.353 --> 11:15.922
- Okay. Here I go.
- Okay.

11:17.489 --> 11:18.524
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:18.557 --> 11:19.992
You ready?

11:20.026 --> 11:21.861
This heat wave is bad.
It's a real nasty one.

11:21.893 --> 11:24.230
Yeah, it's super hot and nasty.

11:25.565 --> 11:26.566
Wait. I'm sorry.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.001
Are we flirting? It's hard to tell.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.952
- Weather's so inherently sexual.
- I was not.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.867
We are supposed to be professional.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.060
This is bad behavior.

11:34.085 --> 11:35.975
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...

11:36.008 --> 11:38.230
No, I was... I was flirting that time.

11:38.255 --> 11:40.082
- With the bad behavior.
- The bad... I was... Yeah.

11:40.107 --> 11:41.681
- And I couldn't even...
- I was... I was riffing on the bad...

11:41.714 --> 11:42.815
- Hard to get that rhythm.
- I know. I...

11:42.847 --> 11:43.982
- Okay. Start over?
- Okay. Let's do.

11:44.015 --> 11:44.983
Okay.

11:45.017 --> 11:45.985
- It's not working.
- Oh. Thank God.

11:46.018 --> 11:47.553
Okay.

11:47.586 --> 11:48.554
Hey.

11:48.587 --> 11:49.855
Will! Help!

11:49.888 --> 11:50.822
They... They... They trapped me.

11:50.855 --> 11:52.258
They caged me like a damn dog.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.393
Oh, dip.

11:54.427 --> 11:55.528
Miggy's hat.

12:02.567 --> 12:05.103
I told you they were mad
about your marching-band stuff.

12:05.137 --> 12:06.339
Will, it's dark,

12:06.371 --> 12:07.539
<i>and I'm scared.</i>

12:07.572 --> 12:08.707
Have you tried the light?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.211
Okay, that part is better.

12:13.244 --> 12:14.947
All right, I'm on my way.

12:14.980 --> 12:16.415
Hey, Tracy,

12:16.448 --> 12:18.016
I am so sorry. There's an emergency.

12:18.050 --> 12:20.053
I have to see about a boy in a closet.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.355
- Huh?
- I'll be back for the 5:00.

12:22.388 --> 12:24.057
Okay, you better because if you're not,

12:24.090 --> 12:25.691
our only option is McCormick,

12:25.725 --> 12:27.226
and he's having one of
his "uh-oh" nights.

12:28.561 --> 12:30.028
Hey.

12:30.062 --> 12:33.365
Why the long lens?

12:38.437 --> 12:39.438
Hey.

12:39.471 --> 12:42.074
Hey you. How you doing?

12:42.108 --> 12:43.944
Mind if I come in for a landing?

12:46.778 --> 12:50.148
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

12:50.182 --> 12:51.951
Hey, I'm a flight attendant.

12:51.984 --> 12:53.552
I see people at their worst.

12:53.586 --> 12:55.922
I did Tampa to Orlando for six years.

12:55.955 --> 12:57.889
It's just that my dad is, like,

12:57.922 --> 12:59.591
so stuck in his ways, you know?

12:59.624 --> 13:01.059
He'll never change.

13:01.092 --> 13:03.462
I know someone like that.

13:03.495 --> 13:05.831
My friend Angie.

13:05.864 --> 13:08.334
Yeah, she always assumes
the worst in people.

13:08.366 --> 13:11.336
And I'm always telling her,
"Angie, come on.

13:11.369 --> 13:13.505
You got to just let people in.

13:13.538 --> 13:15.140
You're so hot."

13:15.173 --> 13:16.241
But she doesn't listen.

13:16.274 --> 13:17.643
She sounds terrible.

13:17.677 --> 13:20.446
You play the xylophone, dude!

13:20.479 --> 13:23.316
Which is just the thing
that Angie would say,

13:23.349 --> 13:25.618
just to give you an idea
of how negative she is.

13:25.651 --> 13:29.989
But, you know, she's working on it.

13:30.022 --> 13:31.824
And... And maybe your dad is, too.

13:31.856 --> 13:34.292
You just got to be open.

13:34.326 --> 13:37.363
You know, if he... gives you his hand,

13:37.395 --> 13:39.698
sh-shake it.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.366
Come on.

13:41.399 --> 13:43.035
Talk to him.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.105
I had to leave work

13:46.138 --> 13:48.173
in the middle of Heatwave Harry...

13:48.206 --> 13:49.341
Or should it be Holly? Is Holly better?

13:49.374 --> 13:51.143
- I like Hank.
- You could never do my job.

13:51.177 --> 13:53.046
You guys are in real trouble.

13:53.079 --> 13:54.213
You can do one of three things...

13:54.245 --> 13:55.514
math, push-ups, or sweeping.

13:55.547 --> 13:57.549
- I love sweeping.
- Then you can't do that one!

13:57.582 --> 13:59.151
Now I have to text Tracy

13:59.185 --> 14:00.787
to tell her that I'm on my way.

14:00.820 --> 14:02.522
Wait. Where's my phone?

14:02.555 --> 14:04.524
Wh... Mine's gone, too.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.392
The Sicilians have an expression...

14:09.161 --> 14:10.963
Yo, give us our phones back...

14:10.995 --> 14:12.398
Miggy. Do not get emotional.

14:12.431 --> 14:13.965
That's the jazz talking.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.968
They're just trying
to get a rise out of us.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.135
All we need to do is remain calm

14:17.168 --> 14:18.704
and keep marching.

14:23.908 --> 14:25.812
<i>Bene, bene, bene.</i>

14:28.614 --> 14:31.050
First of all, thank you all for coming.

14:31.082 --> 14:33.852
You're speaking like
you're addressing 100 people.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.153
I'm only here because of the strength

14:35.187 --> 14:36.989
of this beautiful woman.

14:37.022 --> 14:38.825
Everyone hear that?

14:38.858 --> 14:40.860
Camille is out here killing it.

14:40.893 --> 14:42.595
I'm so proud of you right now.

14:42.628 --> 14:44.397
Okay.

14:44.430 --> 14:47.200
Uh, let's get to the root
of your estrangement.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.541
Xander, were you in high school,

14:49.566 --> 14:51.104
dealing with new emotions?

14:51.137 --> 14:53.190
Maybe we can play some music
to get you back there.

14:53.215 --> 14:54.973
I actually have
some Flo Rida on my phone.

14:54.998 --> 14:55.869
Don't need it.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.777
I'll never forget the day it happened.

14:57.810 --> 14:59.712
Trump had just fired Comey.

14:59.744 --> 15:01.214
- Wait. What?
- What? It was that recent?

15:01.246 --> 15:03.081
That's not the long-standing
feud I had imagined.

15:03.114 --> 15:04.683
Oh, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

15:04.716 --> 15:06.518
It was two years ago.

15:06.552 --> 15:09.388
We had a disagreement
on the golf course,

15:09.421 --> 15:11.190
and this is the first time

15:11.222 --> 15:12.624
we've seen each other since then.

15:12.658 --> 15:14.127
A disagreement?

15:14.159 --> 15:15.794
No. You cheated.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.596
I was about to beat you
for the first time,

15:17.629 --> 15:20.766
and you called the game off
because of a... a fake storm.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.901
I saw lightning!

15:21.933 --> 15:23.068
You saw my ass!

15:23.101 --> 15:25.571
That day was as dry as a cracker!

15:25.604 --> 15:28.074
Oh, yeah, you're so sure
you would have sunk that putt?

15:28.106 --> 15:30.408
He'll sink it on your grave, old man!

15:30.441 --> 15:31.476
Take it back.

15:31.509 --> 15:33.712
Okay, guys... and Camille...

15:33.745 --> 15:35.447
let's move past the golf game.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.715
Or let's move to it!

15:36.749 --> 15:38.216
Let's get to the green!

15:38.249 --> 15:39.818
Yes, let us!

15:39.851 --> 15:41.720
What a lovely day for sport!

15:41.754 --> 15:42.721
- Indeed!
- No...

15:42.754 --> 15:43.923
To the green!

15:43.956 --> 15:45.624
No, guys! Gu... Angie.

15:45.658 --> 15:47.259
Sorry. A lot of momentum.

15:47.292 --> 15:48.393
Angie. Angie!

15:48.427 --> 15:50.010
C-Camille!

15:52.241 --> 15:54.076
All right, you have something of ours,

15:54.110 --> 15:55.544
we have something of yours.

15:55.577 --> 15:56.645
We can figure this out.

15:56.678 --> 15:58.130
Yeah. We're all adults here.

15:58.155 --> 15:59.916
Totally inaccurate. Let's do this.

15:59.948 --> 16:01.549
Tracy's probably furious with me.

16:01.574 --> 16:03.653
Oh, she is.

16:03.686 --> 16:05.088
Based on these texts,

16:05.120 --> 16:06.722
she's steamed like a nice <i> vongole.</i>

16:06.755 --> 16:08.624
What do you want?

16:08.658 --> 16:12.394
Our devices... and $175,000.

16:12.427 --> 16:14.797
Red carpet for the "Cats"
premiere with transportation.

16:14.839 --> 16:16.943
Dignity. And gummy frogs.

16:16.968 --> 16:18.115
- Oh, yeah, those are really good.
- I want those, too.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.067
- I want those.
- Yeah.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.135
- Oh, those are delicious.
- Right?

16:20.168 --> 16:21.504
- So good!
- Oh, my God.

16:21.537 --> 16:23.273
All right, fine! You win.

16:23.306 --> 16:25.141
You can have 'em back.
Just give me my phone.

16:25.173 --> 16:26.909
Devices in the center
of the table on three.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.944
One, two, three...

16:28.978 --> 16:30.626
Four, five, six...

16:30.651 --> 16:31.703
- Just to three.
- Okay.

16:31.728 --> 16:33.243
And release.

16:37.887 --> 16:39.122
What are you doing with my phone, <i>ese?</i>

16:39.154 --> 16:40.723
Chill. Chill.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.360
The WiFi's not working.

16:44.393 --> 16:45.628
Is the Earth off its axis?!

16:45.661 --> 16:47.464
I was in the middle of
buying Lizzo tickets!

16:49.852 --> 16:51.286
Jazz.

16:52.969 --> 16:54.003
Here's the deal...

16:54.036 --> 16:56.039
you will not have access to the Internet

16:56.071 --> 16:58.273
until you make up
for today's bad behavior.

16:58.307 --> 17:01.344
Each chore will yield
one letter, number,

17:01.376 --> 17:02.878
or symbol of the password.

17:07.148 --> 17:08.952
Bro!

17:08.983 --> 17:10.953
We took my jazz and your marching band,

17:10.987 --> 17:12.121
and together we became...

17:12.153 --> 17:13.122
- ...soul mates.
- Marching jazz.

17:13.161 --> 17:14.163
Marching jazz.

17:14.190 --> 17:15.624
That's... That's what I meant.

17:15.656 --> 17:17.992
You better pray for lightning.

17:18.027 --> 17:19.895
You better pray I don't karate you.

17:22.597 --> 17:23.999
Damn it.

17:24.031 --> 17:26.401
- That made no sense.
- No, don't do that.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.637
It made perfect sense.

17:28.712 --> 17:30.546
I'll be right back.

17:32.173 --> 17:34.477
God, this thing is out of control.
I gotta end it.

17:34.509 --> 17:36.412
But I'm sad.

17:36.444 --> 17:38.347
People talk about positivity
feeling good,

17:38.381 --> 17:41.584
and I usually want
to drown those people,

17:41.616 --> 17:45.087
but it... it feels good.

17:45.121 --> 17:48.224
Oh, you poor, sweet,
emotionally stunted dumb-dumb.

17:48.257 --> 17:49.684
You know you can still be sweet

17:49.747 --> 17:51.561
even when you're not playing
a flight attendant.

17:51.594 --> 17:53.542
It's inside you, Ang.

17:53.567 --> 17:54.672
I don't know.

17:54.697 --> 17:55.901
Hey.

17:55.926 --> 17:57.666
What would Camille say?

17:57.700 --> 17:59.067
She'd say...

17:59.101 --> 18:02.505
"Oh, you betcha!"

18:02.538 --> 18:03.873
I decided Camille's from Minnesota.

18:03.905 --> 18:06.075
Okay.

18:06.107 --> 18:07.810
Oh, boy.

18:08.911 --> 18:11.407
Okay, your nostrils
are the size of pancakes.

18:11.432 --> 18:13.081
Are you nervous? Wait a minute.

18:13.114 --> 18:14.961
Did you actually cheat back then?

18:14.986 --> 18:16.586
Of course I did!

18:16.618 --> 18:18.186
There was no lightning.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.756
Where are we, the Great Plains?

18:19.781 --> 18:21.023
I couldn't let my son beat me.

18:21.057 --> 18:23.191
Douglas, why are you
so competitive with him?

18:23.224 --> 18:24.626
You're not that way with the twins.

18:24.660 --> 18:28.031
Nah, they were born
better than me at most things.

18:28.064 --> 18:29.599
Fore!

18:30.766 --> 18:32.067
You hooked it.

18:32.101 --> 18:34.404
But not Xander.

18:34.436 --> 18:36.238
Oh, when he was little, it was perfect.

18:36.271 --> 18:38.707
He used to look up to me
like I was a superhero.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.710
Then he got older,

18:40.742 --> 18:41.977
and I don't know what the hell happened.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.015
I don't know.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.646
Maybe you were afraid
he'd stop looking up to you?

18:44.680 --> 18:45.914
Well, I guess so.

18:45.948 --> 18:47.984
I was so afraid of losing my little boy

18:48.017 --> 18:50.320
that I... I actually lost him.

18:50.353 --> 18:52.288
I screwed up, okay?

18:52.320 --> 18:53.789
And now it's just too late.

18:53.823 --> 18:54.891
It's not too late, Douglas.

18:54.923 --> 18:56.992
You have to tell him how you feel.

18:57.026 --> 18:58.461
He doesn't need this stupid putt.

18:58.493 --> 18:59.795
He needs his dad.

19:11.339 --> 19:12.908
Aah! God!

19:12.941 --> 19:15.478
Dad, what the hell?
I thought you were a bear.

19:15.510 --> 19:18.347
You thought a golf-course bear
put his paw on you?

19:18.381 --> 19:19.449
Doesn't matter.

19:19.481 --> 19:21.817
Look, um...

19:21.851 --> 19:24.287
you don't have to do
any of this, Xander, okay?

19:24.319 --> 19:25.620
You were right.

19:25.653 --> 19:27.123
I did cheat that day.

19:28.356 --> 19:30.460
I tried to keep you in my shadow

19:30.492 --> 19:32.694
because I liked being the big dog.

19:32.728 --> 19:34.931
That's my problem, not yours, okay?

19:34.963 --> 19:38.433
But now you're the big dog,
and I think you're...

19:38.467 --> 19:39.936
I think you're doing really well.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.804
I am doing great.

19:41.836 --> 19:44.941
I've got a $6,500
studio apartment in a mall,

19:44.973 --> 19:46.641
just met a great girl.

19:46.674 --> 19:48.677
Camille!

19:48.940 --> 19:51.269
By the way, we gotta talk.
Not now, though.

19:51.294 --> 19:52.347
This is your moment. You go.

19:52.381 --> 19:53.902
The point is,
I should have told you this

19:53.927 --> 19:55.026
a long time ago,

19:55.050 --> 19:57.820
but... I'm proud of you, son.

20:02.091 --> 20:03.626
Thanks, Dad. That means a lot.

20:03.659 --> 20:06.195
I'm happy to have you back in my life.

20:06.228 --> 20:07.363
You too, Xan.

20:07.395 --> 20:08.498
Come on.

20:08.530 --> 20:10.399
Let's get out of here, huh?

20:11.534 --> 20:12.569
Dad, hold on.

20:14.069 --> 20:17.039
I want to sink this putt... for me.

20:17.073 --> 20:18.874
Okay.

20:18.907 --> 20:21.711
- Go get 'em, kid.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:40.028 --> 20:42.731
I can't believe we share DNA with that.

20:42.756 --> 20:45.146
I'll go to my grave denying it.

20:45.490 --> 20:47.277
<i>...with Chet Corners. And weather...</i>

20:47.301 --> 20:50.621
Let me know if you need any type
of ranch or dipping sauce.

20:50.646 --> 20:52.327
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- And as you can kind of see up here,</i>

20:52.389 --> 20:54.194
<i>there's a low-pressure system
making its way...</i>

20:54.264 --> 20:55.691
- Here you go.
- Mm.

20:55.716 --> 20:58.006
<i>That's gonna come all the way
down the coastline,</i>

20:58.039 --> 20:59.741
<i>and of course just
when you least expect it,</i>

20:59.774 --> 21:00.955
<i>we got a cold front coming through.</i>

21:00.980 --> 21:02.545
Okay. "D."

21:02.578 --> 21:04.780
- "D."
- "D."

21:04.812 --> 21:06.414
<i>...that'll eventually
reach Southern California.</i>

21:06.447 --> 21:07.916
<i>That's of course good news
for the folks in the Valley,</i>

21:07.950 --> 21:10.086
<i>who can finally
give their AC units a break</i>

21:10.118 --> 21:13.923
<i>as Heatwave Howie
turns west towards Maui.</i>

21:13.955 --> 21:16.391
<i>For the KZOP Cooper Center,
I'm Will Weather.</i>

21:16.424 --> 21:17.460
<i>Wait. What'd I say?</i>

21:17.492 --> 21:20.296
I could do that job.
