If you would have pulled off
the Moneyball,

I would have headlined it
in the school blog.

I can't believe we're here.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.512
- Are you all right, son?
- Dad!

42:37.680 --> 42:40.307
What were you doing in the launch area?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.518
I won't speak without my attorney present.

42:43.645 --> 42:44.811
Marty!

42:44.979 --> 42:47.231
MIKE ON WALKIE:
Marty, do you copy? We're in.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.358
Marty, I repeat. We're in. (BEEPS)

42:50.652 --> 42:51.636
In?

42:51.736 --> 42:52.736
Where's in?

42:55.907 --> 42:57.991
AMY: Take a picture when
you get to the Moon, okay?

42:58.159 --> 43:00.702
I'll get it on the front page
of the school paper.

43:00.870 --> 43:01.870
Done.

43:02.497 --> 43:05.082
Can I ask what are you two doing?

43:05.208 --> 43:07.834
(STAMMERING) But, Grandpa!
What are you doing here?

43:08.002 --> 43:11.088
Have you gone crazy?
You need to get out of here. Now!

43:11.214 --> 43:12.714
(POWERING UP)

43:13.258 --> 43:14.758
What the heck did you do?

43:16.511 --> 43:17.511
MIKE: Huh?

43:19.389 --> 43:21.056
Operation in progress, sir.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.850
The rocket will launch without crew
and will get lost in the infinite.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.728
Perfect. Bye-bye, Mrs. President!

43:28.606 --> 43:30.691
Don't even breathe.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.238

43:39.409 --> 43:40.534

Hey.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.874
All engines running?

43:48.042 --> 43:49.376

43:49.961 --> 43:50.961
Huh?

43:51.379 --> 43:52.587
(GRUNTING)

43:52.714 --> 43:54.548
Can you help us open this, please?

43:54.716 --> 43:57.301
It's no use, the ignition sequence is on.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.219
Mission Control, do you copy?

43:59.387 --> 44:00.595
Frank Goldwing speaking.

44:00.722 --> 44:03.223
We're trapped
in the Apollo command module.

44:06.394 --> 44:09.646
Jeez, what a night!
Any more hijinks and I quit.

44:09.814 --> 44:10.840
Relax, man.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.066
I'm sure there won't be any more
surprises before the launch.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.741
Hold on a second.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.004
Have you seen that, Jack?

44:35.006 --> 44:36.089
JACK: That's impossible.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.925
The rocket was set to launch
10 hours from now!

44:40.678 --> 44:41.678
Call Goldwing!

44:44.140 --> 44:46.141
Hey! You! Stop right there!

44:46.309 --> 44:47.517
You can't be here!

45:04.535 --> 45:06.370
- What happened?
- Scott, don't panic, but...

45:06.537 --> 45:07.939
Someone has sabotaged the system.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.373
We can't abort the launch.

45:09.540 --> 45:10.665
It's about your...

45:10.833 --> 45:12.167
Cool, huh?

45:14.295 --> 45:15.295
Scott, wait!

45:27.350 --> 45:28.975
May I ask what you're
doing in there, Captain?

45:29.143 --> 45:30.394
(GRUNTING)

45:30.603 --> 45:34.481
I was taking care of a couple
of intruders when the hatch got locked.

45:34.649 --> 45:35.899
Intruders?

45:36.442 --> 45:37.442

(GROANS)

45:42.865 --> 45:43.949
Frank, who's there?

45:45.868 --> 45:49.230
I found your son and his girlfriend
inside the capsule.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.539
(ALL GASPING)

45:52.500 --> 45:53.860
Huh? Girlfriend?

45:53.960 --> 45:56.362
- What? She's not my girlfriend.
- I'm too young to have a boyfriend.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.879
I don't even have a girlfriend.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.131
(MIKE AND AMY CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

45:59.298 --> 46:00.966
I was trying to tell you.

46:01.134 --> 46:02.384
- We're just friends!
- We're just friends!

46:02.552 --> 46:04.928
Stop it! Mike, what are you doing there?

46:05.096 --> 46:07.722
I was trying to break
the Goldwing curse, Dad.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.976
The curse? What curse?
What are you talking about?

46:11.144 --> 46:12.811
There's no time for pointless discussions.

46:12.979 --> 46:17.107
We've got two options.
We go to the Moon or we eject.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.151
That would destroy the rocket.

46:21.821 --> 46:23.196
(RINGING)

46:24.282 --> 46:25.907
Sir, we've been sabotaged.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.868
You won't believe who is behind this.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.203
Stop Carson. Don't let him take off.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.314
OFFICER ON RADIO: To all units.

46:31.414 --> 46:34.583
Stop Richard Carson.
I repeat, stop Richard Carson.

46:35.084 --> 46:37.252
Okay, let's go, Gigs.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.337
One minute for take-off.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.631
Captain, activate eject mechanism!

46:41.799 --> 46:44.468
Dad, please! We have to
break the Goldwing curse!

46:44.635 --> 46:46.136

SCOTT: Captain? Captain!

46:52.518 --> 46:53.894
Captain, what's going on?

46:54.896 --> 46:58.148
I'm afraid they've sabotaged that as well.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.219
(EXHALES SHAKILY)

47:01.319 --> 47:03.069
Then there's only one option.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.198
Let's go the Moon.

47:06.365 --> 47:09.326
The first thing we've
agreed on in 40 years.

47:09.494 --> 47:10.937
Okay, let's start launch protocol.

- SCOTT: GNC! RETRO.
- Go!

47:17.084 --> 47:18.919
Does that mean we're going, Captain?

47:19.086 --> 47:20.754
"Commander." Call me "Commander."

47:20.922 --> 47:22.532
Let's get ready for launch.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.616

No, no, no! I can't stay!

47:29.847 --> 47:32.349
I've gotta go! My parents
are going to kill me.

47:32.517 --> 47:35.143
Amy, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

47:35.311 --> 47:37.270
You'll be the first woman on the Moon!

47:37.438 --> 47:40.232
Stop the yackety-yak, kids,
and put on your suits.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.486
Everything ready for take-off, sir.

47:44.654 --> 47:45.946
We're leaving, Daddy!

47:48.074 --> 47:50.617
For one rule! I break
one rule in my whole life

47:50.785 --> 47:53.954
and I end up in a rocket
heading to the Moon! Yes!

47:54.121 --> 47:57.374
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a mission to accomplish.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.235
Commander Goldwing, go and get that flag

47:59.335 --> 48:01.002
back before Carson destroys it.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.047
And remember, failure is not an option.

49:25.421 --> 49:29.174
The crew of Saturn V is just
a grandpa and two kids?

49:29.342 --> 49:31.718
Yes, Madam President.
But there is something else.

49:32.678 --> 49:33.678
Go on.

49:33.929 --> 49:37.557
Carson has developed a way
to mine Helium-3 on the Moon.

49:37.725 --> 49:40.268
Helium-3 is the most
powerful energy ever known.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.396
Now, it makes sense.

49:43.564 --> 49:45.940
He cheated the world
and sabotaged our rocket

49:46.108 --> 49:50.236
in order to own the Moon and become
the most powerful man on Earth.

49:50.404 --> 49:53.782
Madam President, we can still launch
some missiles and hit Carson's rocket.

49:53.949 --> 49:54.991
Stop it, Admiral.

49:55.159 --> 49:58.578
If we don't get the flag first,
we won't be able to prove he's a liar.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.455
We have to get the flag,

50:00.623 --> 50:04.668
and this grandpa and two kids
are our only hope.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.993
I'm getting messages?

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.329
Can't be. The antenna is busted.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:53.942

Give me the flag.

Oh, I love family reunions.

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:35.600
How about you, Gigs?

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:37.686
I've never had a family, sir.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.229
Let him go!

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.716

goodbye to the old fart!

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.232
Excuse me, sir?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.109
You are despicable, Mr. Carson.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.236
What do you know, pip-squeak?

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.322
You think you're a genius, but we all know

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.991
that without your father's millions
you'd never be anything.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.078
How dare you, you little...

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.830
Yeah, she's right.
You've inherited everything.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.332
You haven't earned anything!

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.501
What do you know about earning anything?

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.795
Do you think all of this
was built all by itself?

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.464
Do you mean this factory
or whatever it is?

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.925
It's much more than a factory,
you ignoramus.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:51.843
It's a Helium-3 mine!

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:55.097
The greatest energy source
mankind has ever known.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.182
And it's all mine!

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.642
Look at my work!

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:00.644
My father would be proud of me!

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.441
Proud of a liar?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:10.153
You've tricked the world into thinking
that man never walked on the Moon.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.655
Proud of a genius!

01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:14.324
Only a genius could fool the whole world.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:18.036
Only a genius could achieve
the biggest energy monopoly in history.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.789
I'll sell my energy to the whole planet,

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.291
and any country that doesn't
wanna pay for it...

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.460
Boom! I'll disintegrate it,

makes you filthy rich.

Why you left home?

your dad came home from school
with the chicken pox.

you couldn't go to the Moon?

Yes. I got the chicken pox,
so they replaced me.

was to go to the Moon,

I felt like a failure.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:43.601
(GASPS)

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.609
Yeah!

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:02.771
(ALL CHEERING)

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.372
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:06.416
Dad!

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.043
Mission accomplished, Grandpa.

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:13.381
Not yet. There is still
something left to do.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:23.725
FRANK: In 1969,
mankind performed a great feat.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:27.437
We flew to the Moon
and planted a flag there

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.605
in the name of all humanity.

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:34.527
Today, nearly 50 years later,
we repeat this action

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.305
to remind ourselves

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:39.574
that this beautiful natural satellite

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:42.019
does not belong to any one person,

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.162
company, or country,

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.081
but to all of mankind,

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.361
something that future
generations must continue

01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:51.961
to safeguard.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.547
United, like a family.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.843
(ALL CHEERING)

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.549
(INAUDIBLE)

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:24.799
Daddy?

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.759
Is this heaven?

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.163
Is that you, Dad?

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:31.973
Uh... Mr. Carson?

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.601
Gigs? What are you doing here,
without a helmet?

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.770
It turns out I don't need one, sir.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:40.231
I'm an android. Gags made me.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:45.945
Gigs, if you can see this,
it means your life is about to go out.

01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:48.557
That's right, Gigs, you're an android.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.116
I created you.

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:54.245
Oh, you poor little fellow.
You lost your daddy, too.

01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:56.247
Yes, you killed him, sir.

01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:58.958
Never mind, I forgive you.

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:00.986
You've got me now.

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.795
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

01:29:04.131 --> 01:29:07.008
Gigs, can we turn the annoying bot off?

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.802
I can't, sir.
It has an infinite Helium-3 battery.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.930
Mmm, great.
Who's the idiot who approved that?

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:14.765
GIGS: It was you, sir.

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:16.142
CARSON: Oh.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:18.602
It was a good idea.
