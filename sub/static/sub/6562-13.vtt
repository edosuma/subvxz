[air horn blaring]

00:10.500 --> 00:12.967
[all groaning]

00:12.967 --> 00:14.700
- GREAT NEWS, BOYS.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.700
- THE NEWS IS NEVER GREAT
WHEN HE SAYS THAT.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.733
- BIG TIME RUSH IS GOING TO BE
A BIG TIME REALITY SHOW,

PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

00:34.733 --> 00:36.467
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

00:36.467 --> 00:40.700
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

00:40.700 --> 00:42.600
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

00:42.600 --> 00:44.467
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

00:44.467 --> 00:47.600
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

00:47.600 --> 00:48.700
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

00:48.700 --> 00:50.533
- * HEY, HEY *

00:50.533 --> 00:52.567

* UH-OH, UH-OH *

00:59.433 --> 01:00.500
- * OH *

01:00.500 --> 01:02.067

* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT

01:20.300 --> 01:22.333
- I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT DOING
A REALITY SHOW RIGHT NOW,

01:22.333 --> 01:23.967
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY,

01:23.967 --> 01:25.933
I'M IN MY UNDERWEAR.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.133
- HE'S GOT A POINT.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.400
CAN WE GET SOME CLOTHES ON?

01:28.400 --> 01:29.500
- I'M FINE.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.167
I COULD TAKE MY SHIRT OFF
IF YOU WANT.

01:31.167 --> 01:32.667
- YEAH, UH, PLEASE DON'T.

01:32.667 --> 01:35.633
AS FOR THE REST OF US,
WE FEEL A LITTLE BIT EXPOSED.

01:35.633 --> 01:38.233
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE A REALITY SHOW.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.367
EXPOSURE.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.467
BECAUSE MORE EXPOSURE
FOR BIG TIME RUSH

01:41.467 --> 01:42.867
EQUALS MORE RECORD SALES,

01:42.867 --> 01:45.433
WHICH EQUALS MORE HAM
FOR DADDY.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.433
- HAM FOR DADDY IS IMPORTANT.

01:47.433 --> 01:51.067
- NOW, SAY HELLO TO THE HOTTEST
REALITY SHOW PRODUCER

01:51.067 --> 01:52.200

01:53.500 --> 01:57.467

MY GREATEST REALITY SHOW YET,

01:57.467 --> 01:59.867
JUICIER THAN

01:59.867 --> 02:03.200
MORE EMOTIONAL
THAN THE BANANA WHISPER,

02:03.200 --> 02:07.500
AND MORE THRILLING
THAN RICKSHAW COPS!

02:07.500 --> 02:09.200
[man making siren noises]

02:09.200 --> 02:11.267
- STOP!

02:11.267 --> 02:12.633
- RICKSHAW COPS!

02:12.633 --> 02:13.900
- THAT WAS AN AWESOME SHOW.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.967
- AND LET'S NOT FORGET,

02:14.967 --> 02:16.467
REALITY STARS ARE SOME

02:16.467 --> 02:18.300
OF THE BIGGEST STARS
IN THE WORLD.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.933
- AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE,

02:19.933 --> 02:21.600
SINCE I HAVE A CONTRACT

02:21.600 --> 02:25.200
THAT STATES I CAN MAKE YOU STAR
IN A REALITY SHOW.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.200
- I'M IN.
LET'S DO IT.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.067
- NOW, WE START AIRING
IN ONE MONTH ON MTV 12,

02:31.067 --> 02:32.867
SO RELAX, GO ABOUT YOUR LIVES,

02:32.867 --> 02:34.933
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
WE'RE HERE.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.633
ROLLING!

02:36.633 --> 02:38.433
- WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.733
- HEY, DID YOU KNOW
THAT GRIFFIN GAVE THE BOYS

02:43.733 --> 02:45.200
THEIR OWN REALITY TV SHOW?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.433
- REALLY ?

02:46.433 --> 02:47.933
THAT'S GREAT.

02:47.933 --> 02:51.200
BTR WILL GET A TON OF EXPOSURE,

02:51.200 --> 02:54.867
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T
LOOK STUPID ON CAMERA.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.633
- [gasping]

02:57.633 --> 02:59.567
HOW--

02:59.567 --> 03:02.167
WELCOME TO ROCQUE RECORDS.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.200
- HI.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.800
- [giggling]

03:04.800 --> 03:06.800
- HI.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.100
- I LIKE SINGING.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.433
I LIKE PIE.

03:10.433 --> 03:12.200
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.400
- JAMES, ANY SECRETS ABOUT BTR
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

03:15.400 --> 03:18.967
JUICY STUFF, THINGS THAT MAKE
YOU GO, "HMM?"

03:18.967 --> 03:21.500
- OH, UM...

03:21.500 --> 03:23.067
NOPE.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.100
- YO, JAMES!

03:24.100 --> 03:25.133

03:27.100 --> 03:28.733
NO, DON'T DO THAT.
WE'RE NOT HERE!

03:28.733 --> 03:29.933
- OH, OKAY.

03:29.933 --> 03:32.533
HEY, JAMES, I FOUND THIS $20
IN OUR ROOM.

03:32.533 --> 03:33.533
DID YOU LOSE IT?

03:33.533 --> 03:35.167
- I DID!
THANKS, PAL.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.900
- OOH, DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY SOME VIDEO GAMES?

03:36.900 --> 03:38.400
- I'LL GRAB THE PIE.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.200
[laughter]

03:46.200 --> 03:47.333
- CUT!

03:47.333 --> 03:49.833
BOYS, HUGGING
AND VIDEO GAMES ARE FUN...

03:49.833 --> 03:51.400
BUT TERRIBLE REALITY TV!

03:51.400 --> 03:53.800
I NEED TENSION, DRAMA.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.667
SO HOW ABOUT, CARLOS,

03:55.667 --> 03:58.833
YOU DON'T GIVE JAMES BACK
THE MONEY BUT SPEND IT?

03:58.833 --> 04:03.167
AND LATER, JAMES, YOU FIND OUT
AND PUNCH HIM!

04:03.167 --> 04:04.400
ROLL IT.

04:06.467 --> 04:09.533
- WHY WOULD I SPEND MONEY
THAT ISN'T MINE?

04:09.533 --> 04:10.733
- YEAH, THAT'S UNCOOL.

04:10.733 --> 04:11.967

04:11.967 --> 04:14.900
[toilet flushing]

04:19.867 --> 04:21.600
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE THAT.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.700
- YES.

04:22.700 --> 04:23.967
- AWW.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.533
- DOH, CUT.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.100
BUT I CAN'T USE HER

04:27.100 --> 04:29.800
BECAUSE SHE REFUSED
TO SIGN HER CONTRACT.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.700
- YEAH, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
A BUNCH OF CAMERAMEN

04:31.700 --> 04:33.400
FOLLOWING ME AROUND EVERYWHERE.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.367
BUT MOM DID,
FOR OUR COLLEGE FUND.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.767
- WHO WANTS A HEALTHY SNACK?

04:40.767 --> 04:42.133
ARE WE ROLLING?

04:42.133 --> 04:43.967
- OH, THIS SHOW IS BAD.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.400
ROMANCE, YES...

04:46.400 --> 04:47.867
ROMANCE WILL SAVE IT.

04:52.267 --> 04:53.267

04:53.267 --> 04:54.767
- NOPE.
GO FISH.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.067
- THAT'S THE FIFTH TIME
IN A ROW!

04:56.067 --> 04:57.433
- CUT!

04:57.433 --> 05:00.567
WHAT IS THIS?
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE?

05:00.567 --> 05:04.400
LOGAN, THIS SHOW NEEDS PASSION,
BETRAYAL,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.500
THEN PASSION AGAIN.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE
KIND OF AWKWARD,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.200
BECAUSE WE KIND OF
ALREADY DATED.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.633
- YEAH, BUT NOW WE DON'T.

05:11.633 --> 05:15.433
- AND IF YOU WANT THIS SHOW
TO BE AS HUGE AS GRIFFIN DOES,

05:15.433 --> 05:18.067
YOU DO AGAIN.

05:20.767 --> 05:24.700
CAMILLE, I GOT YOU
THESE CHOCOLATES.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.567
OH, LOGAN, I LOVE IT.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.300
BUT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.667
IT'S WRONG.

05:31.667 --> 05:35.067
BUT IT'S SOOOO RIGHT.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.867
- OKAY, WAIT, SO THIS IS HOW
REALITY TV REALLY WORKS?

05:37.867 --> 05:39.267
- YEP.

05:39.267 --> 05:42.533
NOW, YOU TWO, KISS.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.333
REMEMBER, WE'RE NOT EVEN HERE.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.200
AHH!

06:01.200 --> 06:03.267
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE REAL BIG TIME RUSH

06:03.267 --> 06:04.500
IS A DISASTER?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.867
- CARLOS AND JAMES
LIKE EACH OTHER.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.500
KENDALL DOESN'T LIKE
BEING "EMBARRASSED."

06:09.500 --> 06:10.933
LOGAN'S RELATIONSHIP

06:10.933 --> 06:13.533
IS ABOUT AS INTERESTING
AS WET CARDBOARD.

06:13.533 --> 06:14.800
AND THIS.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.833

06:15.833 --> 06:16.833
- HI.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.867
- [giggling]

06:17.867 --> 06:19.867
- HI.

06:19.867 --> 06:23.167
- I TOLD YOU, I NEED THIS
REALITY SHOW TO BE HUGE.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.733
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.233
- 100 MORE CAMERAS,

06:27.233 --> 06:28.567
ONE CASTING ADDITION,

06:28.567 --> 06:30.467
PERMISSION TO MANIPULATE,

06:30.467 --> 06:32.300
AND A SHOCKING ENDING.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.433
- DONE.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.733
THE SHOW AIRS IN ONE MONTH,

06:34.733 --> 06:37.233
AND I NEED IT TO MAKE
A BIG SPLASH.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.067
- HMM...

06:43.067 --> 06:44.300
NO CAMERA CREW.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.367
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
VERY EMBARRASSING.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.700
AW, NO WAY.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.533
HEY!

07:09.533 --> 07:11.533
SO...MY PANTS FELL DOWN

07:11.533 --> 07:12.733
OVER BY THE POOL,

07:12.733 --> 07:15.667
AND I THINK THE CAMERA
SORT OF SAW MY BUTT.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.667
- I KNOW.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.700
IT'S CALLED SHOCK VALUE.

07:18.700 --> 07:22.067
VERY GOOD FOR REALITY TV.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.533
- UH, NO, YOU CAN'T USE THAT.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.367
SO I NEED YOU TO ERASE IT NOW.

07:26.367 --> 07:29.300
[wild laughter]

07:34.167 --> 07:35.600
- I LIVE NEXT DOOR
TO THESE GUYS,

07:35.600 --> 07:37.067
AND IT'S CRAZY, YO.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.700
THEY'RE ALWAYS SINGING
ALL THE TIME.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.900
AND JAMES AND CARLOS
ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING,

07:40.900 --> 07:42.300
AND I'M LIKE, "CHILL."

07:42.300 --> 07:43.933
BUT IT'S BAD.

07:43.933 --> 07:45.700
- UM, WHO IS THAT?

07:45.700 --> 07:47.500
- HE'S YOUR NEIGHBOR.
HIS NAME IS TJ.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.567
YOU'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.467
- NOPE, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT GUY

07:50.467 --> 07:53.067
IN MY LIFE.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.133
- YEAH, JAMES CAN BE COOL,
BUT HE ALSO LIES A LOT.

07:56.133 --> 07:57.900
- HEY, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.633
- REALITY AND TV
AND REALITY TV STARS

08:00.633 --> 08:02.200
ARE NOT ABOUT TRUTH.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.500
THEY'RE ABOUT RATINGS.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.567
AND I NEED MY STARS
TO GIVE ME TENSION AND DRAMA.

08:07.567 --> 08:10.767
AND IT'S TJ HERE
THAT'S GONNA GIVE IT TO ME,

08:10.767 --> 08:14.567
BECAUSE YOU TWO CAN'T.

08:14.567 --> 08:17.533
- OH, YOU WANT TENSION
AND DRAMA, HUH?

08:17.533 --> 08:18.733
I CAN DO THAT.

08:18.733 --> 08:19.733
BAM!

08:19.733 --> 08:20.800
- ROLL.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.200
- OH, YEAH, JAMES?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.067
DINNER TIME!

08:25.067 --> 08:27.233
AHHHH!

08:27.233 --> 08:29.667
- GO TIGHT.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.667

08:31.667 --> 08:32.733
- BOYS!

08:32.733 --> 08:33.900
NO FIGHTING!

08:33.900 --> 08:36.167
HOW ABOUT A HEALTHY SNACK
INSTEAD?

08:36.167 --> 08:38.333
AH!

08:38.333 --> 08:41.100
OKAY, THAT IS ENOUGH!

08:41.100 --> 08:42.333
AAGGHH!

08:42.333 --> 08:43.567
STOP!

08:43.567 --> 08:45.867
- THIS SHOW'S GETTING GOOD NOW.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.933
- BOYS, BOYS, STOP!

08:48.933 --> 08:51.233
- AND IT JUST GOT BETTER.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.467
[soft buzzing noise]

09:01.700 --> 09:03.200
IT'S NOT IN THERE.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.367
THOSE ARE JUST
THE POWER CORDS,

09:05.367 --> 09:07.967
POWERING OVER 100 CAMERAS

09:07.967 --> 09:10.400
THAT WATCH YOUR EVERY MOVE.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.667
- LOOK, I JUST WANT
MY BUTT BACK.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.167
I DON'T NEED MY FRIENDS
IN MINNESOTA SEEING IT,

09:15.167 --> 09:17.400
BECAUSE...IT'S MY BUTT!

09:17.400 --> 09:18.600
- HE'S GETTING MAD.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.767
ROLL.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.233
- LOOK, I'M NOT GETTING MAD.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.233
JUST ERASE THE--

09:22.233 --> 09:23.867
LOOK, WOULD YOU TURN
THE CAMERAS OFF?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.667
- NEVER.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.900
- HEY, BIG BROTHER.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.400
- CUT.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.133
- EVERYONE BACK UP.
BACK UP.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.133
- OKAY.

09:32.133 --> 09:33.200
- I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE THIS.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.300
- TAKE IT EASY.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.733
- YOU, ON THE FLOOR,
GET ON THE FLOOR.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.067
- ALL RIGHT, GET DOWN.
DOWN, DOWN!

09:37.067 --> 09:38.233
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.067
- OKAY, MORE INFORMATION,
PLEASE.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.233
- I WAS IN THE POOL.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.533
I GOT OUT OF THE POOL.

09:45.533 --> 09:46.933
MY PANTS FELL DOWN,

09:46.933 --> 09:50.267
AND THE CAMERAS GOT A SHOT
OF THAT.

09:50.267 --> 09:51.600
- WOULD IT BE INAPPROPRIATE

09:51.600 --> 09:53.400
IF I LAUGHED
REALLY LOUD RIGHT NOW?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.667
- YES.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.400
AND SUPER PRODUCER
WON'T ERASE THE TAPES,

09:56.400 --> 09:58.533
AND NOW I GOT CAMERAS
FOLLOWING ME AROUND EVERYWHERE.

09:58.533 --> 10:00.567
- WHICH IS WHY I SAID NO
TO BEING ON THE SHOW.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.300
- WELL, I HAD NO CHOICE.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.400
NOW, THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU OFFER TO HELP ME,

10:04.400 --> 10:05.767
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.667
- OKAY, I READ OVER
THE CONTRACT,

10:07.667 --> 10:09.733
AND GRIFFIN'S THE EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER OF THE SHOW,

10:09.733 --> 10:11.767
WHICH MEANS IF YOU WANT
YOUR BUTT BACK,

10:11.767 --> 10:14.333
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET IT
FROM HIM, AND I LOVE YOU.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.600

10:57.533 --> 10:59.267
AND I GUARANTEE YOU

10:59.267 --> 11:02.067
GRIFFIN'S NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.100
- BAM!

11:03.100 --> 11:04.467
- ROLL IT.

11:04.467 --> 11:07.867
[shouting]

11:07.867 --> 11:10.067
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.400
I LOVE IT!

11:11.400 --> 11:13.633
REALITY TV AT ITS FINEST.

11:13.633 --> 11:15.133
VERY GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.967
- BUT THE SHOW IS GOING TO BE
TERRIBLE FOR BUSINESS

11:17.967 --> 11:19.967
IF IT TEARS BIG TIME RUSH APART.

11:19.967 --> 11:22.133
JAMES AND CARLOS
CAN'T STOP FIGHTING.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.233
- OOH!

11:26.233 --> 11:27.267
- LOGAN AND CAMILLE

11:27.267 --> 11:29.767
HAVE TO PRETEND THEY'RE IN LOVE.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.800

11:51.900 --> 11:54.100

- THIS IS THE TRUE STORY

12:10.733 --> 12:11.867
OF FOUR BEST BUDS

12:11.867 --> 12:14.167
WHO CAME TO HOLLYWOOD
AS HOCKEY PLAYERS

12:14.167 --> 12:16.833
AND BECAME BIG TIME RUSH.

12:18.567 --> 12:21.100
ONE BAND, ONE DREAM.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.900
AND IN THE END,
YOU THE VIEWERS GET TO DECIDE

12:23.900 --> 12:25.700
WHICH BAND MEMBER
WILL GET KICKED OUT

12:25.700 --> 12:27.500
OF BIG TIME RUSH FOREVER

12:27.500 --> 12:30.733

REPLACEMENT.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.067
- OH, COME ON!

12:36.067 --> 12:37.933
- YOU CAN'T KICK ONE OF US
OUT OF BIG TIME RUSH!

12:37.933 --> 12:39.900
- AS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
OF THIS SHOW

12:39.900 --> 12:43.467
AND C.E.O. OF R.C.M.C.B.T.
GLOBAL NET-SANYOID,

12:43.467 --> 12:45.600
I CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
I WANT,

12:45.600 --> 12:47.167
EXCEPT DIGEST CHEESE

12:47.167 --> 12:49.333
AND STOP MY WIFE
FROM REMODELING.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.500
- GRIFFIN, THIS IS AN INVASION
OF PRIVACY.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.567
- NO, IT'S REALITY TV.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.533
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
GUSTAVO WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.667

YOU CAME TO HOLLYWOOD
TO BE STARS,

13:11.633 --> 13:16.767
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE, HUGE.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.367
MANIPULATED LIKE THIS.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.200
- AND YOU CAN'T KICK
ONE OF US OUT,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.800
BECAUSE BIG TIME RUSH
ALWAYS STICKS TOGETHER.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
- MM-HMM.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.533
- HOW ABOUT AT THE END
OF THE SEASON,

13:32.533 --> 13:35.900
I GIVE THE BIG TIME MEMBERS
NOT VOTED OUT A VICTORY BONUS

13:35.900 --> 13:38.367

- PFFT, MONEY?
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.400
- I'M GONNA WIN THAT MONEY

13:45.400 --> 13:47.900
AND WILL NOT BE THE ONE
VOTED OFF BIG TIME RUSH.

13:47.900 --> 13:52.333
IF YOU ASK ME, CARLOS
WILL BE THE ONE VOTED OFF.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.667
[whispering]
I THINK HE SHAVES HIS LEGS.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.333
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T SHAVE MY LEGS.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.533
JAMES DOES.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.667
AND THAT'S WHY HE
IS GONNA GET VOTE OFF,

14:00.667 --> 14:02.933
FOR HAVING GIRL LEGS, HMPH.

14:02.933 --> 14:04.833
- BAM!

14:04.833 --> 14:07.767

14:09.867 --> 14:11.833
- I'VE KNOWN THESE GUYS
FOR A LONG TIME,

14:11.833 --> 14:14.067
AND I THINK LOGAN
WILL GET VOTED OFF,

14:14.067 --> 14:15.533
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

14:15.533 --> 14:17.500
HE'S A NERD-A-BLERD-A-DERD!

14:17.500 --> 14:18.867
- OKAY, THAT IS NOT A WORD.

14:18.867 --> 14:20.200
AND I WON'T GET VOTED OFF

14:20.200 --> 14:22.500
BECAUSE OF MY
ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN ROMANCE

14:22.500 --> 14:23.967
WITH CAMILLE.

14:23.967 --> 14:26.933
IN FACT, I'M THINKING ABOUT
BREAKING UP WITH HER TODAY,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.933
OR...MAYBE I WON'T.

14:28.933 --> 14:31.600
PERSONALLY, I THINK JAMES
OR CARLOS SHOULD GET VOTED OFF.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.767
- WHAM!

YOU'RE GONNA GET VOTED
OUT OF THE BAND.

- WHY ARE YOU STILL SHOOTING?

14:51.700 --> 14:53.533
- OH, I FOUND A LOOPHOLE.

14:53.533 --> 14:57.133
I CAN USE YOU ALL I WANT
AS LONG AS I PIXILATE YOUR FACE

14:57.133 --> 14:58.800
AND DISGUISE YOUR VOICE.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.300
- [distorted deep voice]
WOW, REALLY?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.833
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.833
- [distorted deep voice]
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

15:10.833 --> 15:13.100
- SOMEWHERE WHERE
THERE AREN'T ANY CAMERAS.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.167
- OKAY, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

15:19.167 --> 15:21.133
'CAUSE I AM STUMPED.

WE'RE GONNA GET MY BUTT BACK.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.933
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR LIVES BACK.

15:36.867 --> 15:39.833
NO AMOUNT OF CRYING
LOUDLY OR DRAMATICALLY

15:39.833 --> 15:41.400
IS GONNA CHANGE THAT.

15:44.467 --> 15:48.233
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SUCH A FOOL?

NOW, IS THAT WHAT WE WANT?

16:51.967 --> 16:53.133
- NO.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.133
- I WANT A MILLION DOLLARS.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.267

16:56.267 --> 16:58.333
- AND WE CAN GET THERE
AS A BAND,

16:58.333 --> 16:59.800

21:04.900 --> 21:06.933
- SO...STILL THINK REALITY SHOWS

21:06.933 --> 21:09.067
AREN'T AN INVASION OF PRIVACY?

21:09.067 --> 21:10.133
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

21:10.133 --> 21:12.733
BECAUSE THIS WILL NEVER AIR
ON TV.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.667

IF YOU ERASE MY BUTT,

21:22.167 --> 21:23.700
