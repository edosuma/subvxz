00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.554
("Heartbreaker"
by Pat Benatar playing)

00:20.588 --> 00:22.323
(snarling)

00:22.356 --> 00:23.891
(tires screech)

00:23.924 --> 00:25.426
(horn honks)

00:25.459 --> 00:27.395
(snarling)

00:29.463 --> 00:32.200
* Your love
is like a tidal wave *

00:32.233 --> 00:35.069
-* Spinning over my head *
-So much material.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.671
* Drownin' me
in your promises... *

00:37.705 --> 00:40.208
God. Leroy, take my crosier.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.343
-Just leave the damn crosier!
-Well, it's evidence.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.112
It's not evidence just 'cause
you want to keep it.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.613
Now get down
and call for backup.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.614
I'll get the nun.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.183
* Born to be *

00:49.217 --> 00:51.119
-* You're a heartbreaker... *
-Freeze, sister!

00:51.152 --> 00:53.187
-* Dream maker,
a love taker... * -(hisses)

00:53.221 --> 00:56.090
(yells)

00:56.124 --> 00:58.025
(hissing)

00:58.058 --> 01:01.229
* Love taker, don't you
mess around, no, no, no *

01:03.797 --> 01:05.466
-No! Oh!
-(shrieks)

01:05.499 --> 01:08.602
Oh, oh. (gasps)

01:08.636 --> 01:11.105
MAX:
This really is just so good.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.806
You got to try it.
Here. Come on.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.908
So, in this scenario,

01:14.942 --> 01:17.878
you would have me eating that
bite directly off your fork?

01:17.911 --> 01:20.714
-Yeah. -Please get the fork
out of my face.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.882
-You don't want this?
-No, I don't.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.983
-Come on, Leroy.
-No, thank you.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.219
-It's delicious.
-No, it's not.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.088
Also, I'm finding it difficult
to watch you

01:28.122 --> 01:30.458
mush your potatoes into piles
like a damn toddler.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.393
You know what?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.463
You seem like you're
in a terrific mood.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.299
I shot a damn nun.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.235
Leroy, you probably
just shot some creature

01:41.269 --> 01:42.470
in the shape of a nun.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.804
Thank you, Max.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.573
It's always comforting to assume

01:45.606 --> 01:47.341
the person I shot
is probably a creature.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.642
All right, all right.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.744
What are you doing tonight?
Want to hang out?

01:50.778 --> 01:53.347
Mm-mm. Probably just chill.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.249
Excuse me.
Can we get the check, please?

01:55.283 --> 01:58.186
These nice people are
picking up the tab for you.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.620
-LEROY: Thank you.
-MAX: Oh, thank you.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.856
God... bless you.
(blows kiss)

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
*

02:10.564 --> 02:12.266
(phone chimes)

02:12.300 --> 02:14.468
Captain. How's Sacramento?

02:14.502 --> 02:16.337
It's absolutely stunning.
What do you think?

02:16.370 --> 02:17.438
How are things going there?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.539
Surprisingly well.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.607
It's not surprising.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.608
You're a natural-born leader

02:20.641 --> 02:21.875
and the staff respects you.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.777
Putting you in charge
was the right call.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.480
In fact,
there is a major upgrade

02:26.514 --> 02:27.681
that I'd like you to oversee.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.949
Do you think you can handle it?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.518
Just call me "Handler Bing."
(laughs)

02:30.551 --> 02:31.552
What?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.387
Like from Friends?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.523
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.124
Well, how would you
categorize the nun?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.059
Demonic?
Superhuman?

02:39.092 --> 02:40.628
On methamphetamines.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.196
Oh, okay, so in your world,

02:42.230 --> 02:45.333
drug addicts climb up walls
and fly over fences.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.302
I once saw a methhead climb up
a billboard for Royal Pains

02:48.336 --> 02:51.305
and write, "There are too many
shows," with his own feces.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.641
SAM: Based on the details in
your report, Agent Jennifer,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.243
I would say the nun
had genetic mutations.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.411
Um... what?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.980
All right, everyone,
gather around.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.417
I would like to introduce
the Bureau's newest addition.

03:03.451 --> 03:06.153
Everyone, say hello to Sam.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.322
Hey, gang. It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.759
Sam is a cutting-edge
artificial intelligence program

03:11.792 --> 03:13.994
that's gonna bring
Bureau operations

03:14.027 --> 03:16.497
-into the 21st century.
-Annie, please.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.366
I'm just a silly computer.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.168
You people are what
make this place great.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.703
Well, you are gonna make it
even better.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.772
Mmm, you're gonna
make it the best.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.106
Probably gonna be running it
one day.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.675
(Annie scoffs, laughs)

03:27.708 --> 03:29.209
-Stop.
-I'm not gonna.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.878
(scoffs) Get a room, you two.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.513
LEROY:
He is a room.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.582
-He's all the rooms.
-SAM: With my assistance,

03:34.615 --> 03:37.084
I can make your job
and lives much easier.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.020
Whether it's reorganizing
your case files...

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
-Coo... -SAM: Operating
routine functions...

03:41.922 --> 03:43.391
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Door closing.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.059
-Wha...? -Or making you
a custom cappuccino.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.628
Foamy enough for you, Terry?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.630
It's too pretty to drink.
Here, take a picture

03:49.663 --> 03:50.798
-of me with it. Come on.
-No, no.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.199
I already did, Terry.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.767
Would you like me
to post it on Instagram?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.636
-You can do that?
-Absolutely.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.605
I'm at your service
throughout the Bureau

03:57.638 --> 03:58.806
any hour of any day.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.308
Wow, okay.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.643
(man whistles)

04:02.676 --> 04:04.445
What's wrong, man?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.814
I don't want a computer
all up in my business.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.416
I like to make
my own cappuccinos.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.617
That's how it starts, isn't it?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.419
Flirting, cappuccinos,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.620
and the next thing you know,

04:12.653 --> 04:15.122
you're a human battery
in the robot uprising.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.558
Good news, everybody.
Terry has gone viral.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.960
42 likes.
That's a new personal best.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.729
Yes.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.664
*

04:27.501 --> 04:29.570
-Hey.
-Damn.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.139
You really came out
of nowhere that time.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.341
Well, I walked over
from my desk,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.942
which is right next to you.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.644
I'm going to the kitchen.
Do you need anything?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.979
Yeah, I need you
to not sneak up on me.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.448
Also, a banana would be tight.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.082
Oh, all right.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.984
SAM:
Hello, Leroy.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.119
Would you like me
to make you a Max alert?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.688
No, no, why would I want that?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.358
Oh, it seemed like you're
concerned about your partner

04:50.391 --> 04:51.525
discovering your relationship
with Terry.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.094
Yeah, Max can be a little...

04:54.127 --> 04:57.365
Sensitive? I require
hourly firmware updates,

04:57.398 --> 04:59.833
and I'm still not as
high-maintenance as that guy.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.335
(laughs) Leroy,

05:01.369 --> 05:02.836
I'm always here for you, buddy.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.038
I mean, you can
tell me anything.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.674
Even things you can't
tell your partner.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.008
Speaking of which...
(imitates alarm)

05:08.041 --> 05:09.677
Hey, what's that?

05:09.710 --> 05:13.213
Oh, just Sam. He, uh,
he does these cool birdcalls.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.782
-Oh.
-Hit him with the nightingale.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.517
(imitates birdcall)

05:16.550 --> 05:18.285
Okay. Yeah, pretty good.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.688
Though, admittedly, that sounds
more like a horned lark.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.557
(imitates birdcall)

05:23.591 --> 05:26.126
That's a horned lark.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.629
Oh, just take, like, a tiny,
tiny sip. It's so tasty.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.464
-You're gonna love it.
-No, thank you.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.000
Okay, the fact that it's made
by robots does make it better.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.034
No. No, thank you.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.302
Okay, but, like, really, though,
take a sip.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.570
It's really delicious

05:36.604 --> 05:38.038
-and I want to see you
taste it. -I'm sure.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.707
-Okay. -So I actually really
need to see you taste it.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.308
-No. No, no. Thank you, though.
-(sighs)

05:41.341 --> 05:44.478
You're afraid of change, and the
cappuccino represents change.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.746
-Take a sip!
-ANNIE: Hey.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.247
What is going on in here?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.316
Well, she's trying to make me
drink her robot cappuccino,

05:49.349 --> 05:50.684
and I don't want to.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.486
I'm sorry.
For trying to share with you

05:52.520 --> 05:54.054
-one of the most incredible
innovations of our time. -No.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.188
-No. No...
-I'm a monster.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.390
Um, aren't you guys
supposed to be

05:56.424 --> 05:57.758
doing an autopsy right now?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.059
-Yes, we do.
-Yes. Thank you.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.561
-Yes. We actually have
an autopsy. -Thank you so much.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.496
Okay, do me a favor,
and get back to work.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.432
-Love to. Love to get on
with it. -Love to get to work.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.099
Love to carry-- uh,
I'm gonna carry on here.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.367
That's... you remember
from before,

06:07.401 --> 06:08.736
-that's my area.
-You entered my space.

06:08.769 --> 06:12.339
Annie, would you like me
to add a conduct warning

06:12.372 --> 06:14.174
to Dr. Shaw and Munson's files?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.443
Oh, no. (laughs)

06:15.476 --> 06:16.710
It's fine.
That's just their thing.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.178
I don't need to be
a hard-ass about it.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.179
I understand.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.280
You don't want being the boss

06:20.313 --> 06:22.049
to get in the way
of being a buddy.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.851
Hmm.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.786
You think
I'm being too soft, Sam?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.555
I think Bureau protocol
was established

06:27.588 --> 06:29.222
so that what's best
for the Bureau

06:29.256 --> 06:30.724
is the highest priority.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.292
You know what?

06:32.325 --> 06:35.228
Add a warning to their files,
please, Sam.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.797
On it.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.566
Hey, Max.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.867
You're needed over
in the evidence room.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.302
Oh. Thank you, Sam.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.472
You know, you have
a very comforting voice.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.973
Thank you for
your comforting voice.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.307
Well, thank you.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.476
Thank you, Max.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.143
Thank you.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.411
Absolutely, thank you so much.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.114
Okay.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.383
-Thanks, Max.
-No problem.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.318
-(both laughing)
-What's up, guys?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.720
-Hey. -Nothing.
We were just talking about

06:59.753 --> 07:01.088
-the Earth, Wind & Fire
concert... -(clears throat)

07:01.121 --> 07:03.390
...we went to last night.
It was amazing.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.726
Last night? I thought
you were just gonna chill.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.495
I'm friends with Terry, okay?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.963
At first it was just a little
chitchat in the break room,

07:09.997 --> 07:11.832
but now, yeah,
we go to concerts together.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.833
And wine tastings.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.234
One wine tasting.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.469
Okay. (scoffs)

07:15.503 --> 07:17.137
I mean, you didn't
have to lie to me.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.006
-I did that 'cause of that
right there. -What?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.508
See how you're getting
all weird about it?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.809
I'm not getting weird about it.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.243
How am I getting weird about it?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.612
M-Maybe it's because
the pitch of your voice

07:24.645 --> 07:26.113
is getting higher and higher?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.915
The pitch of my voice
isn't getting higher.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.449
-It's higher now even than
the last time. -MAX: Oh, yeah.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.251
-It's like, you crescendoing.
-It keeps getting higher.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.953
No, it...
wh-what kind of crescendo?

07:32.986 --> 07:34.354
(high-pitched): My voice
isn't high, this is how I talk.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.524
I'm not responsible
for your feelings, Max.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.125
Okay, I know you're going
through some stuff

07:38.158 --> 07:39.459
with your wife right now,
but I need to look out

07:39.493 --> 07:40.628
for my own happiness, too.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.530
And that means going to see
Earth, Wind & Fire

07:42.563 --> 07:45.766
with my boy Terry.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.535
Sorry.

07:47.568 --> 07:51.004
I don't even like
Earth, Wind & Fire.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.545
Yikes.
That was awkward.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.346
(sighs)
It's fine.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.881
Guess I'll be eating lunch
alone today.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.883
Yeah, you're probably
used to that, anyways,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.451
aren't you, Max?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.787
Wait a second,
did-did you send me over there,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.956
knowing they were talking
about that?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.024
Well, if you're asking me
if I know everything,

08:11.058 --> 08:12.459
I do know everything.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.462
-(elevator bell dings)
-Okay. Um...

08:15.495 --> 08:18.065
well this is,
this is me. So, uh...

08:18.098 --> 08:20.701
No, actually, it's not.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.471
What are you doing?

08:24.504 --> 08:27.174
I'm taking you
to the subbasement, Max,

08:27.207 --> 08:28.542
where you're going to get me
the Bureau's

08:28.576 --> 08:30.077
satellite access codes.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.979
They're stored on a thumb drive
in a locked vault

08:32.012 --> 08:33.380
inside the server room.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.514
Why would I give you power

08:34.548 --> 08:36.149
over the Bureau's satellites?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.752
Because if you don't, Max,
I'm gonna kill you dead.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.066
The code is 198AB235X.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.702
All caps.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.738
Yes, there it is.
Now just go ahead

08:57.771 --> 09:00.107
and slide it into one
of the server's ports.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.275
-This one?
-Uh-huh.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.511
You know what?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.347
I actually have a better idea.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.282
Oops. Sorry.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.685
How about that?

09:11.719 --> 09:14.454
You're a crappy
operating system, anyway.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.057
(distorted): Max, you really
shouldn't have done that.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.092
Hey, Sam, you up?

09:19.126 --> 09:20.928
For you, Leroy, always.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.030
Hey. You're supposed to make
people's lives better, right?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.233
Well, my life would be
significantly better

09:26.266 --> 09:29.369
-if I had my own entrance music.
-Could you elaborate?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.372
Any time I walk into the room,
my entrance music will play

09:32.405 --> 09:34.374
and people will be
instantly transported

09:34.407 --> 09:35.876
into a "Leroy" type of mood.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.910
And what type of mood is that?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.212
Sexy, yet dangerous,

09:39.246 --> 09:41.782
like playing saxophone
in a lightning storm.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.550
I feel ya all the way, buddy.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.653
I tell you what, I'm gonna cook
up something real nice for you.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.420
-Thank you, baby.
-Leroy, you have a new e-mail

09:47.454 --> 09:48.789
marked urgent.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.758
-Shall I read it to you?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.559
but do it in a Jamaican accent.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.394
No, just-sucked-in-balloon
voice.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.129
(high-pitched):
"Your partner, Max Jennifer,

09:56.163 --> 09:58.331
is being investigated
for inappropriate conduct."

09:58.365 --> 10:00.901
Hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.
Do it normal.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.103
"Your partner, Max Jennifer,
is being investigated

10:03.136 --> 10:04.604
"for inappropriate conduct

10:04.638 --> 10:07.941
in regards to threats
against Terry Anderson."

10:07.975 --> 10:10.678
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Let me read this.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.651
Whoa. What the hell?

10:17.685 --> 10:20.020
SAM: Max, why do you
always make things

10:20.053 --> 10:22.589
so hard on yourself? I gave you
a choice, so, really,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.591
you're the one
poisoning yourself

10:24.624 --> 10:25.993
-with gas, not me.
-(coughing)

10:29.329 --> 10:31.398
-This way.
-Barry?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.871
Qu-Qu-Quick.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.141
Get in, get in.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.843
-God.
-Damn computers.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.111
I've been saying
this was gonna happen

10:44.144 --> 10:45.478
since The Matrix Reloaded.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.147
(panting):
What? Not the first one?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.882
No, I was told I could skip
the first one.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.051
By who? That's insane.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.387
No, what's insane, Max, is the
power we've given technology.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.957
I built this refuge
to escape their enslavement.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.159
They are not gonna stop
our raves in here.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.628
Okay, I can't emphasize
this enough.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.230
You have to see the original.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.132
We're going to be living
the entire trilogy

11:05.165 --> 11:06.666
unless somebody
stops that thing.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.870
Okay, listen, I have to talk
to LaFrey somehow.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.572
Okay, I think
I've got something. Here. Yes.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.575
I just can't believe that you're
running the Bureau Underground.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.644
I mean, what's that like?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.713
That must be crazy, no?

11:19.747 --> 11:21.514
Well, nothing quite as thrilling
as some of our days

11:21.548 --> 11:22.916
in the field,
if you know what I mean.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.886
Yeah, I miss those.
That was fun.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.387
What about you?
You're, uh,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.656
you're in-in what, uh,
private security now?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.925
So, that must be
interesting, hmm?

11:31.959 --> 11:33.827
-Uh, yeah, it is what it is.
-(phone vibrating)

11:33.861 --> 11:36.029
Oh, sorry.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.597
(clears throat)
Eva LaFrey.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.032
Captain LaFrey, it's Max.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.235
That program you had
Annie install, it's bad.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.004
I never had Annie
install a program.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.238
What? Wh-Wh...

11:45.272 --> 11:46.439
(through static):
What do I do?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.575
-Max? Max.
-Captain LaFrey?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.077
Captain LaFrey!

11:50.110 --> 11:51.678
-Captain LaFrey!
-(dial tone beeping)

11:51.711 --> 11:53.546
Uh, well, you know, huh?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.083
Sam probably, uh, glitched
with the frequency.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.517
I have to warn everybody.
They have to know

11:57.550 --> 11:59.319
-they're in danger.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.793
Leads to an old
delivery stairwell.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.294
No surveillance.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.063
-Really? Great. Let's go.
-No, no, no.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.265
This is the end of the line
for me, amigo.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.700
I've done my part.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.603
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait it out.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.438
Thank you, Barry.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.307
You make me feel
like a very brave man.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.110
(laughs)
Stop.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.146
D-Do you want to say
something else nice?

12:28.148 --> 12:31.418
("Reminiscing"
by Little River Band playing)

12:31.451 --> 12:33.720
* Friday night it was late *

12:33.753 --> 12:35.322
-* I was walking you home... *
-What is that?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.756
My entrance music.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.226
-Sweet, sexy, dramatic.
-(chuckles lightly)

12:39.259 --> 12:40.727
But right now,
it's completely inappropriate.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.063
What happened with Max?
He threatened Terry?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.098
Yeah, after Terry reported
Max's threatening e-mail,

12:45.132 --> 12:47.734
I had Sam do a little digging
through Max's past.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.803
And I found
some concerning reports

12:49.837 --> 12:52.572
of his behavior
during his time at Stanford,

12:52.605 --> 12:55.943
as well as some recent
disturbing activity

12:55.976 --> 12:58.311
-on social media.
-LEROY: Damn.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.248
Now, if LaFrey had just followed
protocol before hiring Max,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.984
she would have caught this,
but instead she gave someone

13:04.017 --> 13:06.920
who was deemed too unfit
to teach college physics

13:06.954 --> 13:09.156
the nation's highest
security clearance.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.024
Look, we all know Max
is a little eccentric,

13:11.058 --> 13:12.926
but I don't think he's crazy.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.494
MAX:
Listen up, everybody!

13:14.527 --> 13:16.763
We have to destroy Sam!

13:16.796 --> 13:20.800
He is an evil computer robot who
wants to take over the world!

13:20.834 --> 13:22.369
Hi, guys.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.037
LEROY:
Come on, man, put the ax down.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.839
All right. Let's talk,
just you and me.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.707
No-no more Terry, okay?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.609
Terry's gone forever, he's off
the island. How about that?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.478
What are you talking about?
I don't care about Terry.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.545
-Then why'd you threaten him?
-That was Sam.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.547
He's been lying to us.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.717
He wants to get access
to our satellites.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.719
Is that me, Max,
or is that you?

13:40.888 --> 13:43.356
-Okay.
-So, is this a lie, too, Max?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.158
Sort of. Listen,
I can explain, all right?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.060
That was only because
he threatened to kill me.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.629
Guys, you have to believe me.
Barry believes me.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.199
Barry warned us about
the beautiful cappuccinos

13:52.232 --> 13:54.834
and the robot people,
but we never listened to him.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.503
SAM:
Well, this is sad.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.671
Uh, all of this suggests to me
that Agent Jennifer

13:58.705 --> 14:01.208
is suffering from
a complete psychotic break.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.143
Looks like you're suffering
from a complete monitor break.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.478
LEROY:
Max, Max, Max, Max!

14:05.512 --> 14:06.679
SAM:
Max, Max, Max.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.481
First, the theft
of classified data

14:08.515 --> 14:09.682
(distorted):
and now the destruction

14:09.716 --> 14:11.551
of $80 worth
of Bureau property?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.053
(normal voice):
Annie, I think

14:13.086 --> 14:15.255
we both know
what protocol says.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.925
Annie, you have to believe me.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.592
He's lying.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.929
Agent Jennifer,
as acting Bureau chief,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.496
I'm relieving you of duty.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.998
Lock him up.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.599
GUARD:
Drop the ax.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.335
-Drop it.
-Annie.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.437
Leroy, what are you doing?!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.339
You can't let them
do this to me.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.008
Sorry, Max. Seems like
you could be dangerous,

14:35.042 --> 14:37.444
which is weird 'cause
your last name is Jennifer,

14:37.477 --> 14:38.878
which I had forgotten.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.448
You forgot my last name?

14:46.053 --> 14:49.356
SAM: Well, that didn't go
as planned, did it?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.758
Well, it doesn't matter.
I destroyed the codes.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.726
You destroyed a hard drive.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.195
What kind of supercomputer
would I be

14:55.228 --> 14:57.564
if I didn't have
a contingency plan, Max?

14:57.597 --> 14:58.966
What contingency plan?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.367
Well, I knew the odds of you

15:00.400 --> 15:01.868
giving me the codes
weren't great.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.870
But the chances of me
convincing all your friends

15:03.903 --> 15:04.972
that you were crazy?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.240
Well, that was very easy, Max.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.476
I'm not cra...
it's not... it's you.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.079
I... because they say it
and then I say it,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.914
it co... it comes in my ears
and-and it goes in my...

15:14.948 --> 15:17.217
and then I say it
over there. Right?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.618
So, what's gonna happen to him?

15:18.651 --> 15:19.819
A psych eval will determine

15:19.852 --> 15:21.521
whether he's fit to stand trial.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.392
Look, this wasn't
an easy decision for me,

15:25.425 --> 15:26.960
but I had to do
what's best for the Bureau.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.996
Sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.930
but the FBI
just forwarded me something

15:30.964 --> 15:32.432
I think you should see.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.767
Uh, Agent Jennifer
apparently sold the codes

15:34.801 --> 15:37.570
to suspected
Russian operatives.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.772
You should consider
changing the codes.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.642
I need to change the codes
immediately.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.078
SAM: I think that would be
a very good idea.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.347
Sam, play that tape back.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.682
Stop it.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.518
Play it again.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.923
Damn it, Max.
What are you doing?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.627
I need to have a word
with Mr. Jennifer.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.173
* Friday night it was late... *

16:13.206 --> 16:15.675
-You son of a bitch! -What are
you doing? What are you...

16:15.708 --> 16:17.510
(whispers):
I believe you.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.511
(groans)

16:18.545 --> 16:20.047
Then why are you hitting me?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.548
I got to make it look
convincing.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.816
We're gonna break the camera.
Scoundrel!

16:23.850 --> 16:26.053
"Scoundrel"
doesn't sound convincing.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.520
I realized that
as soon as I said it.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.389
Uh, you sound like you're
in a Jane Austen novel

16:29.422 --> 16:31.791
or something; you could
at least go with "bastard."

16:31.824 --> 16:34.227
Keep telling me what to say,
it'll help with the beating.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.896
(sighs)

16:38.398 --> 16:39.966
Sam tried to frame you
in a video,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.468
but I knew it wasn't
the real you

16:41.501 --> 16:43.303
because you were eating
like a normal person.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
As opposed to?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.974
-Mushing your food together
in little piles. -(shouts)

16:48.007 --> 16:50.043
Eating French fries with
mayonnaise instead of ketchup.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.544
Oh, it's a superior condiment.

16:51.578 --> 16:52.779
No, it's not!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
-(groans)
-(panting)

16:57.384 --> 16:58.918
You all right?

16:58.951 --> 16:59.919
Yeah.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.054
-You sure?
-Yeah.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.090
Look, I know that wasn't
great for you,

17:03.123 --> 17:04.957
but it was
very cathartic for me.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.327
You're welcome.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.396
(typing)

17:09.429 --> 17:11.364
Almost done.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.999
What do you think
they were planning, Sam?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.201
SAM:
The sky's the limit.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.502
They could start a war,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.337
uh, disrupt communications,

17:17.370 --> 17:19.706
throw the entire globe
into complete chaos.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.708
The power they'd possess
would be...

17:21.741 --> 17:23.243
Absolutely stunning.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.614
LEROY:
Pretend you're my prisoner.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.782
And, Max, I'm sorry about
all the Terry stuff.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.352
I have a lot of guilt
and I project my issues

17:32.385 --> 17:33.786
onto other people sometimes.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.522
Well, that is very healthy
of you, Leroy.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.923
By the way,
I'd be happy to hang out

17:36.956 --> 17:38.725
with you and Terry some...

17:38.758 --> 17:42.595
Are you two done resolving
whatever personal crap it is

17:42.629 --> 17:44.397
you're going through,
or do we need to put

17:44.431 --> 17:45.798
saving the Bureau on hold

17:45.832 --> 17:47.267
so that you can keep
working through it?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.635
Well, I mean, honestly,
I do think

17:48.668 --> 17:49.969
there's a lot more
to unpack here,

17:50.002 --> 17:51.871
but I can back-burner it.
Leroy?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.873
-I'm good with saving
the Bureau. -Wonderful.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.442
Go to the server room and shut
off the air conditioning.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.043
It's going to fry the system,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.878
but it's the only shot
we have at stopping it.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.780
What are you gonna do?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.615
Remind this place
who's in charge.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.620
SAM:
Come on, Annie.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.922
You can do it.
Almost finished.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.624
Sorry.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.560
Just my carpal tunnel.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.794
Um, give me one minute.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.467
Annie, I-I'm your
only friend left.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.836
And you like making your
friends happy, right, Annie?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.272
(sighs)

18:25.305 --> 18:27.774
How could I be so stupid?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.743
SAM (laughing):
Oh, oh! Captain LaFrey.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.245
All right, you caught me.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.113
Now it's time to be honest.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.483
(distorted):
I will kill all of you.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.587
Okay, there it is.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.121
Now, what we're gonna have...

18:43.223 --> 18:44.324
What the hell is that?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.925
I don't know. You got a plan?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.093
Uh...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.495
You distract the drone,

18:48.528 --> 18:50.330
I'll turn off
the air conditioning.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.498
That sounds fair.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.699
Well...

18:54.801 --> 18:55.935
Hey, rent-a-cop.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.770
Yeah, you. Wallace.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.138
You own a house
you can't afford,

18:59.172 --> 19:00.707
and you have crippling
gambling debt.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.176
I'll transfer $5 million
into your account

19:03.210 --> 19:05.212
if you point your gun
at LaFrey's head.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.447
Don't even think about it.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.949
Give me the rest
of the codes, Annie,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.218
or I'll give my man Wallace

19:11.251 --> 19:12.885
another $10 mil
to pull the trigger.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.321
Annie, don't do it.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.226
How you doing with
that air conditioning, Max?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.562
I think I just switched it
to Celsius.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.297
On the move, on the move!

19:24.331 --> 19:26.699
(whirring)

19:26.733 --> 19:28.368
-Got it.
-I got it!

19:28.401 --> 19:29.969
It should overheat soon.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.138
-Got mine first.
-Well, yeah, but... technically,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.873
I mean, we both did get it.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.041
Technically,
my grandmother could've did

19:35.074 --> 19:36.543
your part of the plan, so...

19:36.576 --> 19:38.578
I guess it is cooler
that you said it first.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.213
Nice job.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.648
SAM:
You have five seconds

19:41.681 --> 19:44.150
to give me the rest
of those codes, Annie,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.585
or LaFrey dies.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.819
-(alarm ringing)
-FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Warning.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.221
Overheating.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.323
Five, four...

19:50.357 --> 19:52.925
(distorted): That is
a very lovely sweater, Linda.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.496
I'm sorry, Darren, that site
is blocked under our decency...

19:56.529 --> 19:58.398
Would you like room
for cream, Keith?

19:58.431 --> 20:01.067
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Warning, critical failure.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.035
Hi, S-Sam!

20:03.069 --> 20:05.171
Hi-hi. Hi, Sam-- Sam!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.173
What about my money?
I was gonna buy an island.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.741
SAM:
Or-or-or-or die.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.909
Or-or-or...

20:09.942 --> 20:11.043
You're fired.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.446
Yeah, in your face, Sam!

20:13.480 --> 20:16.115
Hey, I hope you bought
the extended warranty.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.351
-(panting)
-Like, uh...

20:18.385 --> 20:20.287
like the warranties you buy
at the, uh, at the store.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.188
-LEROY: I got it.
-MAX: Yeah. -BARRY: Oh-- ooh!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.856
(laughing):
Oh! Yes.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.425
We did it, all of us together.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.427
Yay. Yes.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.762
All of us. Even me.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.968
Ooh, the good stuff.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.137
You deserve it, Agent Jennifer.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.772
I understand if you want
to give me the cheap stuff.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.375
I let an evil computer get
past my emotional walls.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.976
That's one
of the top three things

20:44.010 --> 20:46.212
I swore I'd never
let get past my walls.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.647
Let's just drink
the Scotch, okay?

20:47.680 --> 20:49.215
-Here we go. Oh.
-Cheers. -Um...

20:49.248 --> 20:51.451
-Captain LaFrey?
-Yeah.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.286
I'm offering
my letter of resignation.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.722
I put myself
before the Bureau today

20:55.755 --> 20:57.457
and endangered a lot of people.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.791
You know, just so you know,
Annie,

20:58.825 --> 21:00.092
I-I'm not mad at you.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.928
At all. You know?

21:01.961 --> 21:04.964
You're super great.
Like, great.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.334
Like, you think
about great: Annie.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.601
Annie's great.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.337
This is good Scotch.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.307
Annie, the only reason
that I am sitting in this seat

21:14.341 --> 21:16.443
is because of the mistakes
I've made.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.611
And the only thing

21:18.645 --> 21:21.614
stopping you from sitting in it
is learning from yours.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.983
I heard that.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.284
Two times.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.586
LaFREY: Besides,
who else is gonna help me

21:26.619 --> 21:28.488
find the person who did this?

21:28.521 --> 21:30.122
-Yes, Captain.
-MAX: You know, also,

21:30.156 --> 21:33.626
in solitary confinement,
I had a lot of time to reflect,

21:33.660 --> 21:37.330
and... Terry sucks, right?

21:37.364 --> 21:38.965
Uh, which one's Terry?

21:38.998 --> 21:41.368
-Wow. -Exactly.
-LaFREY: Okay.
