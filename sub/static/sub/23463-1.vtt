00:30.420 --> 00:33.830
1963 began not as

00:33.880 --> 00:37.590
a bright green shoot,
unfurling from a seed,

00:37.640 --> 00:41.610
but as the germ of something frozen,

00:41.660 --> 00:46.070
locked like a crystal in
a splinter of black ice.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.630
Nothing grew, nothing moved forward.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.430
Everything was waiting,

00:52.480 --> 00:55.080
marking time until the thaw.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.310
'The winter of 1962-63 is
now known to be the coldest

01:00.360 --> 01:02.190
for almost 300 years.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.870
Temperatures have risen above
freezing on only two occasions...

01:04.920 --> 01:06.830
The water's gone off at
Lisbon Buildings again.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.990
.. falling as low as minus 15
degrees for days at a stretch.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.470
That's quite enough doom
and gloom for one day.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.870
♪ He's so fine

01:12.920 --> 01:14.910

Turn it up, Dad!

01:22.640 --> 01:25.150
Oh, I don't know about
these American pop groups.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.110
There's such a lot of
slang in their songs,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.390
and their diction leaves
a lot to be desired!

01:29.440 --> 01:32.270
You're in danger of being on time
for your paper round today, Tim!

01:32.320 --> 01:35.270
I told you all we had to do was
leave the house ten minutes earlier.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.670
A little pre-planning

01:36.720 --> 01:39.030
and some proper organisation
makes all the difference!

01:39.080 --> 01:41.990
Even when the country is forced
to re-enact Scott Of The Antarctic

01:42.040 --> 01:43.080
on a daily basis?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.630
Good morning, ladies.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.150
I think we'll have you on the
post-natal round today, Nurse Dyer.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.230
Nurse Franklin can do
the booking-in lists,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.710
and Sister Winifred to the maternity home.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.150
I will shoulder the burden
of the district lists.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.350
Nurse Crane, apologies
for the interruption,

01:59.400 --> 02:02.230
but a communication has
arrived for Sister Winifred.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.750
It's from the borough council.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.630
I imagine it's about your driving test.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.990
I doubt it!

02:08.039 --> 02:10.389
I heard they cancelled over
10,000 tests nationally

02:10.440 --> 02:11.960
since this cold snap started.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.880
Oh. Weather permitting, it's in two weeks.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.630
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

02:29.680 --> 02:32.070
To what do we owe this
non-inconsiderable pleasure?

02:32.120 --> 02:35.310
I'm on my way to give a dental
education talk to the mixed infants

02:35.360 --> 02:38.950
and have acquired tubes of
Colgate, one gross, to give away.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.950
- Did somebody donate them?
- Yes, me.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.150
And I got something for you while
I was at the cash and carry.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.510
What, six packets of corn
plasters and a bottle of TCP?

02:48.560 --> 02:49.600
No!

02:52.720 --> 02:54.950
Miss Dior by Dior.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.480
They don't do gift wrapping
at the cash and carry.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.430
And this is the couch where
the poorly people lie down

03:03.480 --> 03:05.320
while I see if I can make them better.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.510
And, sometimes, I look into
their ears with my magic torch

03:10.560 --> 03:13.310
and evaluate the tympanic membrane.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.640
Stop playing with your otoscope!
You'll run the batteries down.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.870
I've just taken a call from
Mr Gelin, 34 Peninsula Street.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.830
His wife has been in a lot of pain

03:24.880 --> 03:27.230
since she was discharged from hospital.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.470
I know she had carcinoma of the bowel,

03:29.520 --> 03:31.950
but that was diagnosed a few months ago.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.350
She was only having
adjustments to her stoma.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.840
Something isn't right. I've put her
on your list for this afternoon.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.070
You all right, darling?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.630
I hope you didn't come
downstairs dressed like that.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.230
I don't like the customers seeing
girls in a state of undress.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.830
I thought they were paying to
see us in a state of undress.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.310
A winceyette nightie and a quilted housecoat
aren't exactly what they had in mind.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.270
Well, it's been a very cold winter.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.310
Er, yes. Thank God for Venus in Furs, eh?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.840
The punters like my act.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.550
It's classy, seeing a mink coat on stage.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.590
And you can play with them
-- opening, closing it.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.630
The regulars are getting bored, Nadine.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.430
"All tease and no flamin'
strip!" one of them said to me,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.630
and I can't have that
getting back to Mr Marmara.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.790
Anyway, you'd best get changed.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.710
I need you to go on after
the Three French Hens.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.350
I don't do lunchtimes.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.390
Lunchtime's for beginners and has-beens!

04:55.440 --> 04:58.510
Meanwhile, I've got a sign outside
saying "Nonstop Exotic Girls",

04:58.560 --> 05:01.660
and Eve of Eden's fell off the
back of some Maltese fella's moped.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.120
You can have ten bob extra
if you go on with her python.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.110
The street is supposed
to be being demolished.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.470
But some of us are owner-occupiers.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.640
The council can't do anything to us.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.030
Arnold!

05:51.080 --> 05:53.390
The doctor's a busy man,

05:53.440 --> 05:57.630
and you waste time
bringing him tea so slowly,

05:57.680 --> 06:01.190
there'll be a sheet of ice on it
before you get it to the parlour!

06:01.240 --> 06:03.670
It's as warm as toast in here, Mrs Gelin.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.830
Ah! I'm fortunate -- I
have an electric fire.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.870
My son, Martin -- he's an eye
doctor in Florida, America --

06:14.920 --> 06:17.270
sent me the money for it.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.750
- You have a lovely home.
- Uh-huh.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.550
Tea for the doctor, and a
little bit of cheesecake.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.150
I... I didn't make it fresh
today but, sometimes, you know,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.510
it cuts a little better.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.790
And it always tastes good.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.630
I know it does!

06:33.680 --> 06:37.790
He worked for Segal's Bakery
for over 20 years and,

06:37.840 --> 06:39.790
the day they closed,

06:39.840 --> 06:43.710
he moved into my kitchen, and
I've hardly seen it since!

06:46.440 --> 06:51.510
Bread he makes every time there's
nothing on the television.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.190
I'm not a man that can sit idle.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.320
And these romantic programmes
-- they don't interest me.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.950
I went in the kitchen,
looking for an aspirin,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.040
and there was a whole tray of strudel.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.990
If you were looking for
aspirin, Mrs Gelin,

07:11.040 --> 07:13.150
was it because you were in pain?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.240
Maybe a little.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.260
Maybe I just wanted to
know where the aspirin was.

07:19.560 --> 07:23.030
Let me finish this cheesecake,
then I'll take a look at you.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.830
Might one enquire as to the nature
of this soup, Sister Julienne?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.680
It is pea this time, I believe. No ham.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.350
A very welcome change.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.470
I thought you should never get
to the end of that mulligatawny.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.710
One imagines we are now to
be faced with this pottage

07:42.760 --> 07:45.520
to an indeterminate sequence of teatimes.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.400
Our numbers are unconscionably depleted.

07:51.880 --> 07:56.430
As it happens, a new midwife
is on her way to join us.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.350
Our burdens will be eased immediately and,

07:59.400 --> 08:04.110
Nurse Franklin, you may be able to
book that long postponed holiday.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.190
That was sharp work, Sister!

08:06.240 --> 08:08.590
Fortunately, a new class just qualified

08:08.640 --> 08:10.830
from a teaching hospital in Somerset.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.710
Nurse Anderson excelled there.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.440
I thought that she might
share your room, Nurse Crane.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.590
By all means.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.870
But Nurse Crane's just
turned Barbara's old bed

08:21.920 --> 08:23.590
into a studio couch!

08:23.640 --> 08:25.230
I'm sure that Nurse Anderson

08:25.280 --> 08:28.440
and I will make very
good comrades-in-arms.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.360
Wasted scatter cushions notwithstanding.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.990
Can I tempt you to a Nescafe?

08:36.039 --> 08:37.510
It's nearly bedtime!

08:37.559 --> 08:39.669
It won't stop me from sleeping.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.270
Maybe we should buy one of
those electric percolators.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.790
Oh, dear!

08:44.840 --> 08:46.190
What?

08:46.240 --> 08:50.070
I've a letter here about Mrs
Gelin from St Cuthbert's.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.910
Her stoma revision wasn't
uncomplicated at all.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.790
I was going to arrange further tests.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.960
She had further tests in hospital...

08:58.400 --> 09:01.430
.. and they showed that the
cancer is back in her bowel,

09:01.480 --> 09:05.510
and she's also been diagnosed
with lung and liver metastases.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.480
Poor woman. She won't have long.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.550
Take your coat off! Come
on, let's get this coat off!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.200
All right, love? Hello!

09:30.440 --> 09:31.630
Is that all we're going to get?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.950
Listen, we've paid good
money! Let's have a look!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.800
Come on, get the coat off!

09:52.040 --> 09:53.790
Right, Nadine. There comes a point

09:53.840 --> 09:57.110
when even two elastic roll-ons
isn't going to hide it.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.470
You knew?

09:58.520 --> 10:01.150
You'll have to go, Nadine. There's
no point me sugar-coating it.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.310
I could manage one more
week! I could manage two!

10:04.360 --> 10:07.270
No-one can tell if I
keep doing Venus in Furs.

10:07.320 --> 10:11.150
And I've been saving and saving
until when the baby comes.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.590
Please, Sonia! Please, just
give me two more weeks!

10:14.640 --> 10:15.990
Stop begging.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.910
Men beg when they think they're in
with a chance of what they want,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.760
and it makes my skin crawl.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.910
What about my wages?

10:23.960 --> 10:26.990
If you're sacking me, you'll have to
pay me off! I've done three shows today.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.870
Yeah, and you never showed more
than a flamin' knee in any of them!

10:29.920 --> 10:33.440
You're a stripper, Nadine.
You get paid to strip.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.960
You can come back, you know,
if you don't keep the kid.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.550
Why would I want to come back here?

10:41.600 --> 10:44.550
Because it's a decent, steady living,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.680
and I think you'll regret it if you don't.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.360
You have no idea what I regret!

10:58.400 --> 11:00.790
When Christian Dior commissioned this,

11:00.840 --> 11:05.350
he said to his perfumiers, "Create
a fragrance that's like love."

11:05.400 --> 11:08.310
Hm. So he got 100 roses,
a big bunch of jasmine,

11:08.360 --> 11:11.070
and squeezed them in a bottle
with a dash of Lemon Pledge?

11:11.120 --> 11:15.390
Oh, Valerie! That's the heart note
of chypre and Sicilian oranges!

11:17.400 --> 11:20.070
Hm! Can I smell furniture polish?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.950
Trixie's been trying on her new perfume.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.870
It was a present from Christopher.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.630
Oh. It's got quite a
personality, hasn't it?

11:27.680 --> 11:31.830
I bring redundant scatter
cushions and grim tidings.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.000
Can't be any grimmer than Valerie's news.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.910
My Auntie Edie's upped
sticks to live in Frinton,

11:37.960 --> 11:40.830
and I'm going to have to
teach ballet classes evenings

11:40.880 --> 11:43.400
and weekends until the
dancing school is sold.

11:44.680 --> 11:45.750
Meanwhile,

11:45.800 --> 11:49.510
the electricity workers are going
ahead with their work to rule.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.120
The power cuts start tomorrow.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.760
Oh!

12:07.120 --> 12:10.190
And no wandering around the coach station.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.270
Fred's going to walk you right up
to the chaperone and hand you over.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.360
Yes, Mum. I love you, Mum.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.990
I'm concerned that the
conditions are too challenging

12:25.040 --> 12:26.150
for a learner driver.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.670
Nonsense! Good driving is
all about caution, attention

12:29.720 --> 12:31.110
and coping with the unexpected.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.480
That's the ticket!

12:40.320 --> 12:41.360
Foot off the clutch.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.920
Of course. First things first.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.280
I'm scared!

12:55.880 --> 12:59.470
Mrs Gelin, I can refer
you back to St Cuthbert's

12:59.520 --> 13:02.750
if you'd like to talk it all
through with the consultant.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.150
Would it make everybody
happy? I know what I know.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.710
You talk about making people happy, Mum!

13:09.760 --> 13:13.750
But what would make me happy
is if you and Dad packed up here

13:13.800 --> 13:16.110
and moved in with Bernard
and me in Hendon.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.990
Dad, Mum doesn't want any strudel!

13:18.040 --> 13:20.560
Hilary, we've had this conversation.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.910
I know you've got two bathrooms.

13:24.960 --> 13:30.230
I know you've got a rotisserie
oven and central heating.

13:30.280 --> 13:35.110
And you know your father
worked his fingers to the bone

13:35.160 --> 13:38.030
to buy this house!

13:39.480 --> 13:40.550
I'll fetch some water.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.160
Ruth! Ruthie!

13:48.040 --> 13:52.470
Just so you know that I know what
it is that we're all not mentioning.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.630
People have different
ways of coping, Hilary.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.070
I know it's hard, but you have
to take the lead from your mother.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.430
They tiptoe around everything!

14:00.480 --> 14:03.510
They won't even discuss the fact that
the street's about to be knocked down!

14:03.560 --> 14:05.110
Have they had an eviction notice yet?

14:05.160 --> 14:08.550
My husband, Bernard, thinks that there
must have been a compulsory purchase order,

14:08.600 --> 14:10.750
but that they've ignored it.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.520
They wouldn't tell us if they had.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.960
Hello!

14:38.960 --> 14:41.060
- So, if you take a seat over there.
- Thank you.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.470
Hello, Dr Turner.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.560
Yes.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.830
I was told this was where to
come to see a Nonnatus midwife.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.470
Did your last doctor give you a
Co-operation card to pass on to us?

15:06.520 --> 15:10.310
I only saw him once, but he gave me this.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.950
Excellent, that's it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.720
We'll get you transferred
to our books straight away.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.910
I do rather envy you with
this sensational coat.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.070
It's earning its keep
at the moment, Nurse.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.630
I've got it on my back all day,

15:22.680 --> 15:24.470
and then on my bed to
keep me warm at night.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.910
Where are you living?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.670
I was working up west
for a couple of years,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.830
but I've just moved into
digs off the Commercial Road.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.270
I grew up round here, so
I thought I'd come home

15:34.320 --> 15:35.990
until after I've had the baby.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.150
Lots of friends and family, I expect.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.640
No. None. And that's the way I want it.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.190
Now, according to your notes, your
blood group is rhesus negative,

15:52.240 --> 15:54.390
which can cause problems for the baby

15:54.440 --> 15:57.550
if it inherits a positive
blood group from its father,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.990
but it doesn't affect first pregnancies.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.590
This one is my first.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.950
Well, then, it won't be a problem.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.630
Out of curiosity, do you know
the baby's father's blood group?

16:07.680 --> 16:11.240
Nurse, I don't even know his
phone number. Or his name.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.990
Ooh!

16:25.040 --> 16:26.750
Oh!

16:26.800 --> 16:28.990
Heavens to Murgatroyd!

16:29.040 --> 16:33.310
I imagine Nurse Anderson's journey
has been delayed by poor weather.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.470
I'll put a salmon sandwich and a
piece of pork pie aside for her.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.350
Would it be rude to ask what's
going to happen to the gateau?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.470
I suppose that rather depends on whether

16:41.520 --> 16:44.790
it's covered in artificial cream or fresh.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.510
Fresh, I'm afraid. It isn't going to keep.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.880
In which case, that settles the question.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.160
Hoorah!

16:59.440 --> 17:03.110
Sister Monica Joan, if these
power cuts are to continue,

17:03.160 --> 17:05.310
I think I have a task for you.

17:05.359 --> 17:10.470
My first responsibility is to
ensure the consumption of this cake.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.869
I would not like our new helpmeet to be

17:12.920 --> 17:16.079
incommoded by the
ingestion of spoiled cream.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.200
Why can't I do it?

17:32.760 --> 17:37.150
The information about electricity
rationing is published every day.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.590
We're in Area J, according to this table.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.030
We were given advance notice last night

17:44.080 --> 17:49.160
that Area J will be
disconnected during Period 3.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.480
According to this table,
Period 3 starts at 5pm.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.350
Their reliance on
numerological formulae is

18:00.400 --> 18:02.310
almost akin to necromancy.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.550
Which is why I'd be so very grateful
if you'd check the paper every day.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.400
If you give us the information,
we can organise our work.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.990
Christopher!

18:15.040 --> 18:18.230
Would I be right in remembering you
have a few hours off this afternoon?

18:18.280 --> 18:22.110
Barring emergencies, to which we
are, of course, perennially prone,

18:22.160 --> 18:23.270
yes, you are!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.640
That's splendid. I've
brought you a present.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.680
Alexandra!

18:30.640 --> 18:33.870
You can take the morphine
orally for now, Mrs Gelin.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.550
No need for any injections,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.840
and Nurse Crane will
explain the dose to you.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.870
I didn't want the bed brought downstairs.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.950
You'll be warmer, Mrs Gelin. And
the stairs were troubling you.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.880
The damage to my paintwork
is troubling me more!

18:51.880 --> 18:53.950
The bag has come away!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.510
Dr Turner, on your way out,
could you call upstairs

18:56.560 --> 18:59.590
and tell Mrs Gelin's daughter
we'll be needing a change of linen?

18:59.640 --> 19:00.680
Of course.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.310
No, no, no! Don't let Arnold see!

19:06.360 --> 19:08.990
Don't worry, don't
worry. We'll soon have...

19:09.040 --> 19:10.640
we'll soon have that changed.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.790
Will the new nurse come today?

19:21.840 --> 19:26.190
I hope so, after all the hard
work you've done on this snow lady.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.430
It's rather a shame we
didn't give her any hands.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.030
A manicure would have
finished her off perfectly!

19:31.080 --> 19:34.710
You could have one of our manicure
lessons later, if you'd like.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.230
Don't you want to try a bit
of my new nail varnish?

19:37.280 --> 19:40.950
It's Pomegranate Kiss. You've been
longing for me to buy that one!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.400
My mummy says only tarts
paint their nails.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.120
Oh, look, look, look! It's starting!

19:55.200 --> 19:57.630
Alexandra didn't realise
what she was saying.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.160
I'm not sure she even knows
what the word "tart" means!

20:02.480 --> 20:04.350
But she knew the way her mother said it.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.350
And that was enough.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.430
Moira is a very bitter woman.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.710
On the balance, it
probably wasn't wise for me

20:10.760 --> 20:13.510
to take Alexandra home last week
with bright pink fingernails.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.990
They weren't bright pink, Christopher!

20:16.040 --> 20:18.550
They were a sort of delicate salmon.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.630
Anyway, she'll be taking a
lovely plate of Krispie Cakes home

20:21.680 --> 20:25.030
to her mummy this time, so perhaps
my reputation will be restored.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.510
Your reputation is spotless.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.750
Your ex-wife called me a tart.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.310
I wouldn't mind, but we
didn't even get to go skiing.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.870
What does skiing have to do with it?

20:33.920 --> 20:36.790
Well. We would've been away.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.440
Together. In Switzerland.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.430
Switzerland is hardly a separate
moral universe, Christopher.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.790
We would've been staying in a hotel.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.270
And I still want us to stay in a hotel.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.110
I don't care if it isn't in Switzerland.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.240
I don't care if it's five minutes
up the road in Epping Forest!

20:56.840 --> 21:00.230
I just want to be somewhere, with you,

21:00.280 --> 21:02.190
in a room where we can close the door

21:02.240 --> 21:04.280
and not be troubled by anyone else.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.990
I really don't think this
is an appropriate location

21:11.040 --> 21:12.440
for this sort of talk.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.710
We have another picture postcard
from Nurse Mount and Nurse Busby

21:18.760 --> 21:22.480
whose latest adventures
involve a safari in Botswana.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.150
It's as well we found a new recruit.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.310
We shall just have to hope she turns up.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.950
I just spoke to the Matron,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.990
Nurse Anderson cleared her room

21:33.040 --> 21:35.110
at the Taunton Nurse's
Home yesterday morning,

21:35.160 --> 21:37.550
and left on the early train.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.590
She's a young girl, travelling alone!

21:40.640 --> 21:44.680
If she doesn't materialise tonight,
we have to notify the police.

21:49.160 --> 21:53.150
"Nurse Lucille Anderson, SRN, SCM.

21:53.200 --> 21:58.110
"Age 25. Not likely to be in uniform.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.710
"Height, unknown.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.910
"Hair colour, unspecified.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.830
"Eye colour, a matter of conjecture."

22:04.880 --> 22:07.870
I can hardly put five County
Constabularies on alert

22:07.920 --> 22:09.470
with only that to go on.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.150
Nevertheless, Sergeant,

22:11.200 --> 22:14.110
no-one should vanish
and not provoke concern.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.960
I leave you with the facts
I have at my disposal.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.830
I'm sure Christopher was joking
about the hotel in Epping Forest.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.590
He wasn't joking about the hotel.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.350
Or everything that that implies.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.320
He brought the subject up
again when he telephoned today.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.590
Crumbs, thanks to the power cuts,

22:33.640 --> 22:36.240
I don't think we have a
single set left clean.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.640
The thing is, Valerie,
I'm not that sort of girl.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.870
And I've never been that
sort of girl. Not once.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.600
In the whole of my life.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.550
I was knee deep in Test
Yourself On Road Signs!

22:56.600 --> 22:58.870
Sister Monica Joan said
there were no power cuts

22:58.920 --> 23:00.190
in our area till tomorrow.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.470
I should have checked the
information she gave us.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.110
I asked too much of her,
and she was mistaken.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.670
I was not mistaken!

23:06.720 --> 23:10.110
The statistical evidence was erroneous,

23:10.160 --> 23:12.150
and probably falsified

23:12.200 --> 23:15.430
by those who would
conspire against society.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.750
Sister, you must not distress yourself.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.190
Anyone can make a mistake.
I make them all the time.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.280
And not one of them is seized upon

23:24.330 --> 23:27.350
as proof of your... derangement!

23:28.920 --> 23:33.350
You are too swift to declare
that my mind is infirm!

23:33.400 --> 23:34.910
That is not the case at all.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.630
We've all been under strain,
and you are not invincible!

23:38.680 --> 23:41.590
And neither am I consigned
to second childishness!

23:41.640 --> 23:44.990
"Sans teeth, sans taste,

23:45.040 --> 23:47.310
"sans eyes,

23:47.360 --> 23:50.720
"sans everything!"

24:20.120 --> 24:21.720
Come in, quick! Out of the snow!

24:23.000 --> 24:25.190
Do you need to see a midwife?

24:25.240 --> 24:26.440
I am a midwife.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.150
I'm Nurse Anderson.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.990
Lucille Anderson.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.310
Ah, of course you are!

24:33.360 --> 24:35.560
And I just fell over!

24:37.040 --> 24:39.430
I'm sorry we're in the
middle of power cut!

24:39.480 --> 24:42.390
I'm sorry I'm late! I've
been travelling for two days.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.670
- Have you brought a suitcase or anything?
- I brought two,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.470
but I had to leave them behind,

24:46.520 --> 24:49.190
- when we were forced to
evacuate the train. - Ah.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.240
Nothing a bit of Germolene won't fix.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.390
We couldn't have said the
same if you'd had frostbite.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.070
My mother sent me the money
for these fleece-lined boots

25:03.120 --> 25:05.150
the very first winter I was in Taunton.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.160
They stay in their box until this year.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.230
- Is Taunton where you
did your training? - Yes.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.430
Quite a few of us arrived from the
West Indies and went straight there.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.510
One hot water bottle, one cup of tea,

25:17.560 --> 25:21.430
one nip of the nuns' cooking
brandy, and, of course, a candle.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.310
I feel like a cross between a St
Bernard's Dog and Wee Willie Winkie.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.710
The Germans have ten feet
of snow every winter,

25:27.760 --> 25:30.510
and they don't go
abandoning trains on a whim.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.630
In all fairness, it wasn't really a whim.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.350
We were stuck in a sidings for 14 hours.

25:36.400 --> 25:39.990
So, I suggested to the guard
we all just get out and walk.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.790
He took a modicum of persuading,

25:41.840 --> 25:44.520
but the sensible course of
action was quite obvious.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.990
You'll breathe more
easily sitting upright,

25:51.040 --> 25:53.510
at least until we get
some oxygen organised.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.990
Martin!

26:01.040 --> 26:02.750
Breathless?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.990
No.

26:04.040 --> 26:09.240
I just ran to the phone
because I was so excited.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.200
Martin.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.120
Mum's lying.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.430
I've brought you a couple of pairs
of my nylons, just to tide you over.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.350
And some brand-new thermal knickers,

26:24.400 --> 26:27.110
from the Order's official supply.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.350
I so appreciate your kindness.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.310
It's shoulders to the wheel at
eight o'clock tomorrow morning!

26:32.360 --> 26:34.260
You make the most of your early night.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.110
- Sleep well!
- Night.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.950
I had to wake the poor
lass up this morning,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.590
she slept through her alarm clock.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.590
What do you suppose our patients will say,

27:10.640 --> 27:12.350
about her being... coloured?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.710
One would hope they won't say anything.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.670
There have been West Indian nurses
at St Cuthbert's for some time.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.230
Nevertheless, people can
be frightfully ignorant.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.870
Hmm. And RUDE. Especially round here.

27:22.920 --> 27:26.630
Anyone saying anything sideways
deserves to be corrected.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.270
The National Health was struggling,

27:28.320 --> 27:31.320
till all these girls started
coming from the Commonwealth.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.670
Good morning, Nurse Anderson!

27:49.720 --> 27:52.870
I know you've already met
Nurse Dyer and Nurse Franklin.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.630
- This is Sister Winifred.
- Very pleased to meet you.

27:55.680 --> 27:59.190
- Likewise. You look very smart.
- Thank you.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.550
Didn't you want any breakfast?

28:00.600 --> 28:03.200
We thought the smell of
bacon might have tempted you!

28:05.160 --> 28:08.030
All right, sweetie, can
you stand up for me?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.680
Sorry.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.350
She's got a raging temperature.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.230
No wonder you collapsed!

28:15.280 --> 28:17.080
Right, back up to bed with you!

28:18.360 --> 28:21.030
It's a rip-roaring bladder infection.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.710
Five days of lemon barley water

28:23.760 --> 28:26.110
and antibiotics ought to set her straight.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.790
No work for at least a week.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.320
I'll make sure she rests.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.710
Well, you have at least a
couple of weeks to decide

28:59.760 --> 29:01.590
where you're going to have the baby.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.790
But, Nadine, I would say you'd
have more support in the hospital,

29:04.840 --> 29:06.910
or a maternity home.

29:06.960 --> 29:10.110
I'll be on me own wherever I go, Nurse.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.430
I got used to hiding
things, when I was working.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.590
I quite like the thought
of just hiding, now.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.200
You've done nothing wrong, Nadine!

29:20.560 --> 29:22.960
We're here to take care
of you and your baby.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.000
Can't even decide on a name for it.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.160
Because they change the names
when babies get adopted.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.030
It doesn't seem worth it,

29:35.080 --> 29:36.710
picking something lovely,

29:36.760 --> 29:38.240
then it getting thrown away.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.950
Do you give out leaflets?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.110
About adoption?

29:46.160 --> 29:48.080
Yes. We do.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.480
You may enter.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.190
I didn't want to disturb you.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.790
Oh! When I am fixed upon a task,

30:15.840 --> 30:19.270
the diminution of my
attention is not possible.

30:19.320 --> 30:24.990
- I am led to understand you
have a bladder disorder? - Yes.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.270
I was a little unwell
when I set off for London,

30:27.320 --> 30:29.520
and the journey made matters worse.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.240
You have a wonderful book collection.

30:37.960 --> 30:41.030
There are whole worlds
within their boards.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.110
"Much have I travell'd
in the realms of gold,

30:44.160 --> 30:47.950
"And many goodly states
and kingdoms seen."

30:48.000 --> 30:51.030
"Round many western islands have I been

30:51.080 --> 30:54.230
"Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold."

30:54.280 --> 30:56.510
You are acquainted with Mr Keats!

30:56.560 --> 30:57.870
I know him well.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.030
I was a librarian back home in Jamaica,

31:00.080 --> 31:02.400
before I came here to train as a nurse.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.550
Oh, dear! They're in a terrible jumble.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.390
Would you like them rearranged

31:08.440 --> 31:10.790
according to the Dewey Decimal System?

31:10.840 --> 31:13.830
They are aligned according
to the understanding

31:13.880 --> 31:18.830
that exists between
their authors and myself.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.360
No rearrangement is required.

31:24.600 --> 31:30.110

I do not care if regulations

32:13.880 --> 32:19.670
"do not permit private vehicles
within designated demolition zones."

32:19.720 --> 32:22.430
I am engaged in delivering
vital medical supplies

32:22.480 --> 32:24.750
on behalf of the National Health Service.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.790
Can't you get out and walk?

32:26.840 --> 32:31.190
As I have a large replacement tank
of oxygen in my boot, I cannot.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.790
If you do not remove this barrier,

32:32.840 --> 32:36.200
I shall find myself obliged
to confer with your superiors.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.910
How long is this going to go on for?

32:46.960 --> 32:51.550
The last time I examined you,
your cervix was dilating nicely.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.590
Just a few more hours.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.910
Hours? Not days?

32:55.960 --> 33:00.430
Nobody's labour is allowed
to go on for days, Nadine!

33:00.480 --> 33:02.590
Not in the modern world.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.590
And yours is progressing beautifully.

33:05.640 --> 33:09.590
I had to see this woman once,
about a kid I didn't want to have.

33:09.640 --> 33:13.310
She did something with
something sharp, and cold,

33:13.360 --> 33:16.070
but didn't let me see and
then sent me on my way.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.950
Those pains went on for three days!

33:19.000 --> 33:23.670
- Was it this baby you were
trying to get rid of? - No.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.350
When that one came away,

33:25.400 --> 33:27.870
it weren't much bigger than my hand.

33:27.920 --> 33:31.840
It was like a little bright-red doll.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.510
So, this isn't your first pregnancy?

33:35.560 --> 33:37.750
It's my first baby, isn't it?

33:38.800 --> 33:40.090
It's all right, sweetie.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.360
This time, we're going to try the gas.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.720
I'll see to it, Mr Gelin!

34:05.520 --> 34:08.510
Good morning. Are you the
proprietor of this vehicle?

34:08.560 --> 34:10.870
Yes, Sergeant Woolf. I am.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.080
It's causing an obstruction.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.870
May one enquire as to what, and to whom?

34:16.920 --> 34:18.949
Essential demolition work.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.909
Which appear to have ceased
at the first sign of snow.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.750
This street is now the
site of major public works.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.350
Your car is classified as a nuisance.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.350
And you are intruding on a private home.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.350
The council have informed us that
as soon as the houses opposite

34:33.400 --> 34:35.790
have been levelled, then all
the utilities on this side

34:35.840 --> 34:39.350
will be disconnected, and demolition
will follow in short order.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.550
That won't be convenient, I'm afraid.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.520
I have an extremely poorly
lady to take care of.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.110
What you doing, Nurse?

34:50.159 --> 34:53.670
I'm just checking Baby's position.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.070
It's always been a wriggler.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.670
Used to reckon if I decided to keep it,

34:58.720 --> 35:01.150
I could take it back to the Red Sesbania

35:01.200 --> 35:03.470
and get it a job as a contortionist!

35:03.520 --> 35:06.870
I can't promise it's going to
appear in a spangled leotard,

35:06.920 --> 35:11.000
but it would seem we have a bit
of a trickster on our hands.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.990
It's breech.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.870
- Is that bad?
- Not bad.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.150
Just rather inelegant.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.230
I'm afraid it's poised
to come out bottom first.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.790
I'm just going to knock next door
and ask them to call Nonnatus House.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.750
Sister Winifred, if you didn't
damage the War Memorial,

35:28.800 --> 35:30.750
and you didn't damage Nurse Crane's car,

35:30.800 --> 35:32.750
I really don't think it
counts as an accident.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.310
It counts as a failed manoeuvre.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.710
The only manoeuvres you need to
be thinking about this afternoon

35:38.760 --> 35:43.550
are midwifery-related... You
head off to the maternity home...

35:43.600 --> 35:44.830
.. they've got three ladies there

35:44.880 --> 35:47.980
in labour -- and I'll go and help
Nurse Franklin with this breech.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.230
Hello, Nonnatus House? Midwife speaking.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.630
That was Sister Julienne.

36:00.680 --> 36:04.000
She's got undiagnosed twins,
on the far side of the district.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.990
I'm sorry, Lucille. I
know you're not well.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.630
But this is like when Churchill
had every plane in the air

36:13.680 --> 36:16.950
in the Battle of Britain!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.150
Just give me a bicycle. And a map.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.680
You don't need a map!

36:22.600 --> 36:23.950
You follow me,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.990
and I'll drop you with Trixie and
then go on to the twins case.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.070
Something's happening in
my back passage, Nurse!

36:31.120 --> 36:33.070
I think you're feeling the urge to push.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.070
But you must try not to, until
we're sure you're fully dilated...

36:36.120 --> 36:38.710
- I can't help it!
- Yes, you can, Nadine! Blow.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.550
Lots of short blows, like this.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.190
Just until I've managed to examine you!

36:51.880 --> 36:54.190
Are you all right, Lucille?

36:54.240 --> 36:55.870
I'm in fine fettle!

36:55.920 --> 36:58.190
I've just never ridden on
this kind of road before.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.400
- It's called cobblestones, you'll
have to get used to them. - OK.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.830
Prop your bike here, then
straight down that alleyway,

37:08.880 --> 37:12.080
up the stairs and look out
for flat 9. Best of British!

37:18.720 --> 37:20.350
Nadine... Nadine, sweetie!

37:20.400 --> 37:23.430
We need to change your position.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.950
And you need to listen to me.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.190
I can't do it!

37:41.240 --> 37:42.870
Yes, you can...

37:45.800 --> 37:47.950
.. and you have!

37:48.000 --> 37:50.270
You're exactly where we need you to be.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.150
Bottom right on the edge of the mattress,

37:52.200 --> 37:55.600
and one foot pushing down on each chair.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.930
Midwife calling!

37:59.480 --> 38:02.670
- How many breech births
have you seen? - Three.

38:02.720 --> 38:06.630
Two complete breech during hospital
training, one frank on the district.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.950
Everything else is in my head,
fresh as paint from my final exams!

38:10.000 --> 38:12.510
She started pushing before
she was fully dilated.

38:12.560 --> 38:16.790
The last time I examined her, I felt
a definite anterior lip of cervix.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.920
That doesn't matter now. The
rest will unfold as it unfolds.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.710
With your next pain,
Nadine, I want you to push.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.630
Can't you just pull it out, Nurse?

38:28.680 --> 38:32.110
Oh, we've got lots of party pieces
up our sleeves if you need them.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.750
But right now, the more work you
do, the better it is for Baby.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.310
Motherhood starts here...
with a vengeance.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.270
That's it, that's it. Keep it coming!

38:49.840 --> 38:51.880
Nurse, something feels a bit funny.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.550
Let's see how things are coming along.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.030
I can feel a foot.

38:58.880 --> 38:59.920
Or a hand...

39:01.280 --> 39:03.110
"Toes are all the same length,

39:03.160 --> 39:05.470
"and the great toe cannot be abducted.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.350
"The os calcis or heel bone has
no equivalent on the hand."

39:08.400 --> 39:09.910
It's a foot.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.990
Another one of those pushes
when you're ready, Nadine.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.830
We're going to keep things
moving slowly and steadily.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.390
Here it comes!

39:24.680 --> 39:26.350
First foot.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.440
And the other one.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.910
Baby's born up to her
tummy-button now, Nadine!

39:32.960 --> 39:35.430
You are a natural-born
deliverer of babies!

39:35.480 --> 39:38.430
Now, Nadine, I want another one
of those beautiful, steady pushes

39:38.480 --> 39:40.550
with your next pain. You'll know when.

39:45.020 --> 39:46.190
Wonderful!

39:47.240 --> 39:48.280
Wonderful.

39:49.840 --> 39:54.150
Now I'm going to wrap
Baby, to keep her warm

39:54.200 --> 39:57.080
and turn her just a quarter of a circle...

39:58.840 --> 40:01.200
.. so that we have one arm...

40:03.240 --> 40:04.760
.. and another!

40:06.120 --> 40:07.430
Oh, thank the Lord!

40:07.480 --> 40:09.830
But you're a clever girl, Nadine.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.830
Then I'm going to gently let go,
and let her hang just for a moment.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.870
Gravity can do amazing things.

40:16.920 --> 40:20.760
It keeps our feet on the ground
and bring babies down to earth.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.990
I can't see the neck or
the hairline, Lucille...

40:28.040 --> 40:29.960
Extended head?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.110
Nadine, sweetie. Can you manage
without Nurse Anderson behind you,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.030
- just for a minute?
- Why?

40:36.080 --> 40:40.080
It's all right, darling. Just
another game for the birth club.

40:42.480 --> 40:46.710
I need you to apply suprapubic
pressure, as I manoeuvre the baby.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.010
Mouth's free!

40:58.560 --> 40:59.990
And the nose is free.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.800
Extractor.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.870
There.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.230
Come on, Nadine. Good girl.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.990
That's it, good girl. That's it.

41:49.320 --> 41:53.150
Do you want to hold
your little girl, Nadine?

41:53.200 --> 41:54.510
I'm scared...

41:54.560 --> 41:55.800
No.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.640
You're brave.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.320
So unbelievably brave.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.120
And I wish we all had your courage.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.630
Baby's in surprisingly good condition,

42:23.680 --> 42:27.070
But the mother disclosed that
this is her first live birth,

42:27.120 --> 42:30.550
not her first pregnancy. She
had a back-street termination.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.510
So there may be rhesus
complications after all.

42:33.560 --> 42:37.230
I've left the cord long in
case baby needs a transfusion.

42:37.280 --> 42:41.310
Let's transfer them here, as soon as
an ambulance can negotiate the snow.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.790
Thank you.

43:11.080 --> 43:14.080
Nurse, Nurse! Thank God you're here!

43:24.720 --> 43:26.350
Ruth!

43:26.400 --> 43:30.110
I leave you overnight, and look
at the spectacle that greets me.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.550
She started coughing,
it turned to retching.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.500
It... It just poured out of her mouth.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.440
Oh.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.310
I've got a treat for you!

43:48.360 --> 43:52.190
A heat lamp that bathes
your poor nether regions

43:52.240 --> 43:54.710
in a lovely soothing glow!

43:54.760 --> 43:57.190
I feel like I've been
riding on a bacon slicer.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.110
You have had quite a few stitches. Ooh!

44:00.160 --> 44:02.390
You don't sound too good either!

44:04.120 --> 44:07.910
Well, don't tell anyone, but
midwifery's just my hobby.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.550
Evenings and weekends, I teach
Toddler Tap and Baby Ballet

44:11.600 --> 44:13.750
at Madame Edith's School of Dance.

44:13.800 --> 44:17.870
I went to Madame Edith's! Down
at the British Legion hall?

44:17.920 --> 44:20.470
It's at the Iris Knight
Institute these days.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.830
Madame Edith's my aunt, but
she's just retired to Frinton,

44:23.880 --> 44:28.070
and wants to sell the school as a
going concern and buy a bungalow.

44:28.120 --> 44:32.030
I loved Madame Edith! She was
the first person to ever make me

44:32.080 --> 44:34.120
feel like I was good at something.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.510
When will we know if
she's going to be poorly?

44:38.560 --> 44:41.510
Any jaundice will start to
show within the next day or so.

44:41.560 --> 44:45.240
It just looks like a bit
of a sun tan at first.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.710
Patrick, what's your
favourite European language?

44:50.760 --> 44:52.430
- English.
- Wrong answer!

44:52.480 --> 44:54.990
You have choice of French, German,

44:55.040 --> 44:58.310
Spanish, Italian, Danish or Hungarian.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.390
We're getting an au pair.

45:00.440 --> 45:03.790
I imagine you're going to
enlighten me as to what that is?

45:03.840 --> 45:07.630
It's a new Continental
system of domestic help,

45:07.680 --> 45:10.390
in which young ladies wishing
to improve their English

45:10.440 --> 45:12.990
lodge with British families
in exchange for help

45:13.040 --> 45:15.070
with housework and childcare!

45:15.120 --> 45:16.950
So, I decided I'm getting an au pair.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.470
Enter.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.390
I wondered if Doctor could come
and have a look at Baby Mulvaney?

45:23.440 --> 45:25.840
I can see definite signs of jaundice.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.830
Can't I go with her?

45:28.880 --> 45:31.200
She's too little to go
anywhere on her own.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.430
I saw the ambulance outside!

45:37.480 --> 45:40.600
Baby's being sent to St Cuthbert's,
for an exchange transfusion.

45:49.560 --> 45:51.670
You were right, of course.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.750
Pulmonary haemorrhage.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.230
It's the secondaries in the
lungs that are going to take her.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.630
I already knew the blinds were going down.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.190
She's taken no nourishment
for three or four days.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.390
Can I come in?

46:05.440 --> 46:07.310
It's your house, Mr Gelin.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.480
Come and sit down.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.270
You don't have to break the news.

46:12.320 --> 46:16.390
I knew as soon as she stopped
polishing the candlesticks.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.750
Blood all over the bed,
I didn't need to see...

46:19.800 --> 46:23.590
Are you getting any support
from your synagogue, Mr Gelin?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.670
I haven't gone to synagogue for years.

46:25.720 --> 46:28.990
I paid my dues, but I just stopped going.

46:29.040 --> 46:32.600
The congregation got
smaller, people moved away.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.040
I moved away.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.440
Up here.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.430
Even if I've never left this house.

46:42.880 --> 46:45.040
You can't throw them out!

46:46.440 --> 46:49.270
This is their house, and they
have a right to stay here.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.750
The Council are confident
that all the procedures

46:51.800 --> 46:54.550
have been observed, madam. I'm
here to ensure they're carried out.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.390
Why don't you wait till
my mother's carried out?

46:57.440 --> 46:59.600
In a bloody box!

47:00.720 --> 47:02.120
Go inside, lass.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.790
Would you be so kind
as to step aside, sir?

47:09.840 --> 47:12.950
There are times when uniform
speaks best to uniform,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.520
and this is one of them.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.230
Thank you, Nurse. What you'll find...

47:18.280 --> 47:20.830
I'm afraid you misconstrue,
Sergeant Woolf.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.430
My uniform is going to talk to your
uniform, not the other way around.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.830
And what my uniform says is this --

47:26.880 --> 47:31.470
there is a woman in this house
who has days, or hours, to live.

47:31.520 --> 47:34.750
She came to Poplar more than
30 years ago, as a German Jew,

47:34.800 --> 47:37.030
to escape persecution.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.390
And if you hound her out of her house now,

47:39.440 --> 47:42.990
if you drag her from the bed where
we are striving to keep her at peace

47:43.040 --> 47:46.870
and free from pain, you will
have as much on your conscience

47:46.920 --> 47:49.960
as those who drove her from
the place where she was born.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.030
I am not entirely without
compassion, Nurse.

47:56.080 --> 47:59.040
My own grandparents came here from Russia.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.350
And there goes the telephone wire!

48:04.400 --> 48:06.790
Her one link with her son in America!

48:09.280 --> 48:12.000
The ties that bind can be so very fragile.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.800
Stay right where you are!

48:16.240 --> 48:20.200
Staying sober is about not giving in.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.280
Not letting go.

48:25.640 --> 48:30.040
Not allowing yourself to do the one
thing that will make you happy.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.960
Self-discipline becomes a habit.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.840
Self-protection becomes a habit.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.150
And you think you're putting on armour,

48:42.200 --> 48:44.200
but in truth you're building a cage.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.240
And it's safe in a cage.

48:49.480 --> 48:52.710
You can even sing quite
a satisfactory song,

48:52.760 --> 48:54.160
as I've discovered.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.360
But one way or another...

49:00.280 --> 49:02.000
.. you're still behind bars.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.950
You just...

49:05.000 --> 49:06.830
aren't having anything to drink.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.440
Waiting for a passing is
like waiting for a birth.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.120
We need things to keep us occupied.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.680
There's nothing to be afraid of, Arnold.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.680
Is she in pain?

49:40.880 --> 49:43.950
Her chest, it sounds
as though it hurts her.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.520
Not any more. We've taken
care of all of that.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.070
She's still Ruth.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.920
And she needs you.

49:57.960 --> 50:01.470
I've had the, er, telephone
line repaired this morning,

50:01.520 --> 50:05.350
and there's a stay on all demolition
work until further notice.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.550
If I could be informed when the, um,

50:07.600 --> 50:11.150
when the end comes, that
would be appreciated.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.670
There are things I can set in train.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.510
Thank you, Sergeant.

50:15.560 --> 50:18.120
The East End's still good
for some things, Doctor.

50:23.120 --> 50:26.920
If I never said I was grateful to you.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.960
I say it now.

50:31.160 --> 50:36.230
If I never said I was proud
of the home that you kept,

50:36.280 --> 50:38.960
I say it now.

50:42.960 --> 50:47.230
If I didn't tell you
that you were beautiful,

50:47.280 --> 50:49.000
when your face grew lined...

50:50.720 --> 50:54.870
.. when you didn't have a new blouse
from one summer's end to the next,

50:54.920 --> 50:57.480
I say it now.

50:58.680 --> 51:01.720
And if I didn't tell
you that I loved you...

51:04.220 --> 51:05.700
.. I say it now.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.800
Missing you...

51:17.320 --> 51:19.760
.. I will talk about tomorrow.

51:38.760 --> 51:42.190
They say they're going to discharge
Elizabeth in a week or two.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.640
Elizabeth?

51:45.360 --> 51:47.070
That's a nice name.

51:47.120 --> 51:50.160
It sounds smart, and respectable.

51:51.320 --> 51:54.190
She can do a lot in life,
with a name like Elizabeth.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.440
And I'm going to be
around to watch her do it.

51:57.880 --> 52:00.510
Have you decided against adoption?

52:00.560 --> 52:02.400
I let her in, Nurse.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.950
I let her in, and it was
like she tore me open!

52:07.000 --> 52:09.390
Not just my body,

52:09.440 --> 52:12.030
but my whole self.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.760
I'm not sure I even knew I had
a whole self, until she came.

52:18.120 --> 52:22.320
Some people spend a lifetime
waiting for love like that.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.440
And some people are just scared of it.

52:49.440 --> 52:51.630
Gelin residence.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.440
This is Mrs Gelin's nurse speaking.

52:55.280 --> 52:56.600
Hello, Martin.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.120
I'm afraid your mother's just passed away.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.080
Your suitcases came!

53:35.320 --> 53:38.350
Apart from my church hats
being a little bit squashed,

53:38.400 --> 53:41.120
they survived very well,
all things considered.

53:45.360 --> 53:49.310
So did this! West Country
Clotted Cream Fudge.

53:49.360 --> 53:52.960
My mother always told me never
to turn up anywhere empty-handed.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.310
And I... put a hot water bottle
under the eiderdown for you.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.430
I thought you might need
it, coming from a death bed.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.760
Thanks, lass.

54:16.200 --> 54:19.630
- I want my wages.
- What wages?

54:19.680 --> 54:23.190
For the last two shows I did,
and for covering Eve of Eden.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.310
I want my wages. And I'm not begging,

54:25.360 --> 54:27.080
because you don't like that.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.230
Have you pawned your mink?

54:31.280 --> 54:34.750
No. I sold it. I'm
buying a dancing school.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.390
And I'm paying cash for the goodwill.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.160
I think the phrase you'd use
is "decent, steady work".

54:49.240 --> 54:52.200
Don't forget your
self-respect on the way out.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.200
This is my self respect!

55:03.240 --> 55:04.750
You asked to see me.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.750
And I wasn't wholly sure I was
going to be in favour or out of it

55:07.800 --> 55:10.200
- so I got you these.
- Thank you.

55:13.600 --> 55:17.190
I think it's time that we booked
that holiday, Christopher.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.670
The skiing holiday?

55:19.720 --> 55:21.910
If I may paraphrase,

55:21.960 --> 55:26.310
I just want to be somewhere, with you,

55:26.360 --> 55:29.230
in a room where we can close the door

55:29.280 --> 55:31.840
and not be troubled by
anyone else for a while.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.870
I think we can manage that.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.430
You'll be fine, OK. Breathe in and out.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.670
In through the nose, and
out through the mouth.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.670
Worked a treat for me, at El-Alamein.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.070
And have a piece of fudge.

55:43.120 --> 55:45.390
She's on her way to take her driving test.

56:40.920 --> 56:44.750
It is not always sunshine
that splits the seed

56:44.800 --> 56:46.630
cleaving the armour,

56:46.680 --> 56:48.870
releasing the shoot.

56:48.920 --> 56:52.110
Darkness makes the heart's case fragile.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.030
Pain breaks it open.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.750
Courage teases out the leaves

56:56.800 --> 57:01.950
and life unfurls and expands

57:02.000 --> 57:05.120
thrusting upwards into light.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.150
Oh, good afternoon, Mr Gelin!

57:10.200 --> 57:11.790
Oh!

57:11.840 --> 57:13.870
I can't linger.

57:13.920 --> 57:18.400
Hilary's outside, in the Rover, and
she's scared someone'll scratch it.

57:19.400 --> 57:21.070
Are you off to live in Hendon, then?

57:21.120 --> 57:24.600
Hm. Her kitchen, you wouldn't believe it!

57:25.920 --> 57:29.590
And this is the last thing
that came from mine.

57:29.640 --> 57:33.040
Strudel. Oh!

57:34.440 --> 57:37.200
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.550
She does look rather stern.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.670
Magdalena, meet the family.

58:00.720 --> 58:02.070
- Hello.
- Oh.

58:02.120 --> 58:05.190
Get those curlers out or she'll
look like she's just off the boat.

58:05.240 --> 58:09.150
I love the time that the
three of us spend together.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.480
- Men? In a mothercraft class?
- You know what you should do.

58:13.560 --> 58:17.160
- I miss her, Nurse. - Life really
can change in the blink of an eye.
