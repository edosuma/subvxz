00:02.398 --> 00:04.301
- How did Batman get Robin?

00:04.430 --> 00:06.959
- Bruce Wayne adopted
Dick Grayson

00:06.959 --> 00:10.838
after Bruce Wayne saw
Dick Grayson's parents murdered

00:10.838 --> 00:11.555
at a circus.

00:11.555 --> 00:13.210
- He watches the kid's parents
get killed.

00:13.444 --> 00:14.861
He immediately
scrambles out there.

00:14.861 --> 00:15.823
He's like,
"you want to live with me?"

00:16.395 --> 00:17.143
Is that the way it went?

00:17.143 --> 00:18.204
- No.
- No.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.597
- Actually-- - he does a
little private-eying.

00:20.644 --> 00:22.140
- Okay.
- He goes and checks the ropes.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.952
He's like,
"acid on the ropes."

00:23.952 --> 00:25.222
- Right, of course.
- "This was murder."

00:25.372 --> 00:26.005
- Mm-hmm.

00:26.371 --> 00:27.576
- So he goes and solves
the murder,

00:27.576 --> 00:31.003
but he also sees himself
in Dick.

00:31.289 --> 00:32.290

00:33.920 --> 00:36.119

- Oh, okay.

00:36.171 --> 00:38.058
- He's a multi-billionaire,
man.

00:38.194 --> 00:39.567
It's like if Donald trump today
was like,

00:39.601 --> 00:41.598
"I want a ten-year-old boy,
pronto!"

00:41.598 --> 00:42.933
- He has a ten-year-old boy.
- He's got it there.

00:42.933 --> 00:43.722
It's there yesterday.

00:43.722 --> 00:46.319

00:50.815 --> 00:52.258

Caitlin Fairchild,

handle that.

- I am. I love Catwoman.

03:09.187 --> 03:10.450
- Which version of Catwoman?

03:10.871 --> 03:12.142
- Uh, goggles' Catwoman.

03:12.925 --> 03:14.194
Goggles paisano Catwoman,
yeah.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.364
- Really?
- I like the purple--

03:15.364 --> 03:16.779
purple dress Catwoman for me.

03:16.857 --> 03:18.099
With the slit.
- With the little cape.

03:18.099 --> 03:19.150

the cat o' nine tails.

03:22.442 --> 03:23.463
I'm going with goggles.

zatanna, chick magician.

03:26.893 --> 03:28.394
She wears a little tuxedo

And she's magical.

- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, how you doing?

03:43.050 --> 03:44.943
- We have a toy store
down by the shore,

03:45.244 --> 03:47.083
and we got
a bunch of comic books in,

03:47.123 --> 03:48.688
which we don't really mess with.
- Okay.

03:48.876 --> 03:50.131

could take a look at them.

03:50.131 --> 03:51.170

- Cool.

03:51.218 --> 03:52.258

03:53.441 --> 03:55.653

that I thought would be key.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.975

Look at that.

03:57.975 --> 04:00.164
Whoa. Hypodermic needle.

04:00.554 --> 04:01.576

04:02.082 --> 04:02.452
- You know what?

04:02.452 --> 04:04.052
I've only heard
about this book.

04:04.145 --> 04:08.974
"SET IN NEW YORK CITY - BATMAN'S CITY
WASN'T NAMED 'GOTHAM' 'TIL ISSUE #48"

04:09.090 --> 04:10.957
- Back in the '40s,
it wasn't as scandalous,

04:10.957 --> 04:12.573
I don't think,
to put a needle on the cover

04:12.639 --> 04:15.071
as it came to be
in the '60s and '70s.

04:15.071 --> 04:16.326
- There was no code
back then, right?

04:16.603 --> 04:17.380
- No code.

04:17.745 --> 04:19.527
And a hypodermic needle,
I guess,

04:19.527 --> 04:21.358
wasn't as synonymous with...

04:21.623 --> 04:22.398
- Drugs?

04:22.398 --> 04:24.789
- Illicit activities
as it is today.

04:24.789 --> 04:26.427
At a certain point,
they were banned.

04:26.894 --> 04:27.430
- Really?

04:28.093 --> 04:29.828
- D.C. tackled heroin,
remember?

04:29.828 --> 04:33.026
With Green Arrow discovering
his kid's sidekick, Speedy,

04:33.470 --> 04:34.727
was sitting there
shooting up.

04:34.911 --> 04:36.529
- Still shocking
to this day

04:36.693 --> 04:37.821
when you see Speedy

04:38.014 --> 04:39.889
shoving that needle
into his arm,

04:39.889 --> 04:41.676
and then you see Green Arrow
in the background,

04:41.676 --> 04:43.133
you know, shocked.

04:43.525 --> 04:44.941
- Heartbroken.
- Heartbroken.

04:45.189 --> 04:46.173
And green lantern, you know--

04:46.173 --> 04:47.412
- has to hold him back.
- Yeah.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.166
- What do you think he's holding
him back from?

04:49.166 --> 04:50.593
Like, "I must help him!"

04:50.593 --> 04:51.846
Or "I'll beat him

04:51.846 --> 04:53.127
within an inch
of his life!"

04:53.127 --> 04:55.510
'Cause it was the '70s, and you
could get away with that.

04:55.510 --> 04:56.963
- You don't know what
Green Arrow's gonna do.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.457
- If you remember,
in that comic,

04:58.457 --> 05:00.046
- he smacked him around.
- Did he really?

05:00.046 --> 05:01.613
- Yeah, he slapped him.
- Well, how old was Speedy at this point?

05:01.671 --> 05:03.090
- Speedy was 17.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.652
- But Speedy is not
Green Arrow's son.

05:05.812 --> 05:07.259
He's just his sidekick,

05:07.316 --> 05:09.479
the way Robin is not related
to Batman.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.858
Are you allowed
to slap some sense into him?

05:12.332 --> 05:14.156
- Of course.
- He's not your kid.

05:14.156 --> 05:16.158
That's like walking up
to somebody else's kid and be like, hey!

05:16.296 --> 05:18.800
- are you allowed to bring Robin
in to fight the penguin

05:18.800 --> 05:19.858
and the joker?

05:20.969 --> 05:21.606
- Good point.

05:21.817 --> 05:23.241
[Laughter]

05:23.363 --> 05:24.710
- I was wondering
if you could give me

05:24.710 --> 05:26.996
some kind of value or what we're
talking about here.

05:27.029 --> 05:29.028
- In the condition it is,
300.

05:29.373 --> 05:31.286
But I think I couldn't make
a profit on it.

05:31.286 --> 05:32.479
It just seems like it's--

05:32.992 --> 05:34.818
- it's the condition
that hurts it so much.

05:34.818 --> 05:35.559
- Yeah.

05:35.559 --> 05:37.900
- I actually have one more
Batman item I brought.

05:38.476 --> 05:40.597
This I thought was
really, really unique.

05:41.395 --> 05:42.283
- Oh, ho, ho.

05:42.530 --> 05:43.162
- Whoa.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.283
Bob Kane, 1970.

05:49.379 --> 05:53.507
"FIRST APPEARANCE OF BATMAN AND
ROBIN WAS IN DETECTIVE COMICS #38"

05:54.456 --> 05:55.580
This is amazing.

05:55.826 --> 05:56.823
How did you get this?

05:56.823 --> 05:58.153
- This came in
with this collection.

05:58.153 --> 06:02.417
The collector who got this
apparently was eating in a place

06:02.417 --> 06:04.181
that Kane was eating
in New York.

06:04.181 --> 06:07.030
And, uh, he asked him
if he would do a quick sketch,

06:07.030 --> 06:08.131
and Bob did it for him.

06:08.131 --> 06:10.767
- In 1970.
Bob Kane, no longer with us.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.555
This is a one-of-a-kind.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.413
- I mean,
this has gotta be priceless.

06:14.892 --> 06:16.575
It was the classic Kane,
you know.

06:16.647 --> 06:17.579
Grinning ear to ear.

06:17.663 --> 06:18.945
- Happy to be fighting crime.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.887
- Happy to be fighting crime.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.859
- Batman used to be happy?
- Yeah.

06:21.859 --> 06:22.987
At least,
that was the Bob Kane.

06:22.987 --> 06:24.643
And every time
he drew Batman,

06:24.820 --> 06:28.163
he had, like, this giant smile,
and Robin too.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.566
- That would be
off-putting, though.

06:29.566 --> 06:31.219
Like, you're mugging somebody,
and then someone

06:31.219 --> 06:32.625
dressed like the Batman
shows up,

06:32.711 --> 06:33.620
but he's smiling.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.311
- Yeah, that's what
I'm saying.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.082
Even with those smiles,
behind it,

06:37.301 --> 06:39.824
there's still something spooky
and eerie about it.

06:39.824 --> 06:41.491
- Unnerving, like,
"why are you smiling at me?

06:41.491 --> 06:42.466
Stop it."
And he's--

06:42.911 --> 06:44.916
- still, you talking
about Batman and Robin.

06:45.163 --> 06:47.160
I mean, I think it's
Santa claus, Michael Jackson,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.025
Batman, and then Robin
are the most recognized faces

06:49.025 --> 06:49.630
on the earth.

06:49.758 --> 06:51.050
- Robin?
- Yeah.

06:51.091 --> 06:52.626
I think so.
Batman and Robin together.

06:52.801 --> 06:54.179
- Jesus nowhere on that list.

06:54.179 --> 06:55.944
[Laughter]

06:56.217 --> 06:58.543
- It looks like
whatever Kane drew this on,

06:59.183 --> 07:01.373
there looks to be--
you can see some words

07:01.373 --> 07:02.510
coming through
the other side.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.139
Like, it almost looks like
a script

07:04.139 --> 07:06.553
or a document of some kind,
something typed.

07:06.935 --> 07:08.589
- I've always been curious
what was under there,

07:08.589 --> 07:10.557
but I was always worried
it was gonna diminish the value

07:10.557 --> 07:11.886
of the piece
by opening it.

07:11.886 --> 07:13.812
- That's a concern,
but it doesn't look like

07:13.812 --> 07:16.329
- it was a professionally framed piece.
- Right, yeah.

07:16.329 --> 07:17.272
- It looks like
you could take

07:17.272 --> 07:19.020
the back out easily
and open it up.

07:20.254 --> 07:22.215
You don't know what this piece
of paper could be.

07:22.215 --> 07:23.481
It could be, like,
maybe he was working

07:23.481 --> 07:24.471
on another character.

07:24.756 --> 07:25.975
- I have no idea, man.

07:25.975 --> 07:28.638
- Maybe some new character maybe
he never got a chance to do.

07:28.638 --> 07:30.333
"KANE CREATED THE ANIMATED SERIES
'COURAGEOUS CAT AND MINUTE MOUSE'"

07:30.700 --> 07:32.155
It could be anything.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.681
- So let's check it out
and see what we got.

07:35.352 --> 07:37.171
- On the front,
the Bob Kane drawing.

07:37.335 --> 07:38.882
On the back,
national treasure!

07:39.065 --> 07:40.667
- Yes, and that's what
I was going for.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.969
Whatever's on the back of this
could be so huge,

07:43.139 --> 07:45.173
it could make this sketch
even jump up

07:45.360 --> 07:47.574
to $100,000.
- Right.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.840
- He was like,  "let's crack it open."

07:49.286 --> 07:51.223
- He's had it all this time,
and he's just like, "you know--"

07:51.752 --> 07:53.182
- he talked him into it.

07:53.975 --> 07:55.003
- Silver-tongued devil, you.

07:55.281 --> 07:56.238
You should've been like,
"you know what?

07:56.238 --> 07:57.203
Take your pants off, too."

07:57.234 --> 07:58.669
Just see how far you can get him going.

07:59.137 --> 08:00.657
- I was getting woozy
and sweaty,

08:00.657 --> 08:01.803
'cause I'm like,
"I don't even know

08:01.803 --> 08:03.446
what's gonna be
on the other side of this."

08:03.446 --> 08:06.037
And as he fumbles
with the, uh--with the--

08:06.417 --> 08:07.304
- we're still talking--
- frame.

08:07.328 --> 08:08.025
- We are still talking

08:08.025 --> 08:09.780
about the comic book page now,
right?

08:10.199 --> 08:11.583
- Actually, I was talking
about the pants.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.106
[Laughter]

08:13.480 --> 08:14.675
You want me to get
my white gloves?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.076
- Nah, but you gotta figure,
if Bob touched it,

08:17.076 --> 08:17.920
we can touch it.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.735
- All right.
- Let's check it out, man.

08:20.289 --> 08:22.019
- Be careful.
- Okay.

08:22.358 --> 08:25.345
[Suspenseful music]

08:25.629 --> 08:26.438
Wow, man.

08:26.438 --> 08:31.107
¶

08:31.567 --> 08:32.763
Lets see what we got here.

08:34.152 --> 08:35.976
- Whew. Here we go.
- Here we go.

08:42.215 --> 08:44.249
Uh, I don't know
what that is.

08:44.249 --> 08:45.205
You guys wanna--

08:46.476 --> 08:47.357
- it's a press release.

08:47.357 --> 08:50.982
- Yeah, for some sort of, uh,
gall--art gallery

08:50.982 --> 08:53.916
that was having a showing
of some sort of paintings.

08:54.112 --> 08:56.099
- It could've been something
that he had on him.

08:56.178 --> 08:59.087
He probably did get
stuff like this all the time.

08:59.361 --> 09:00.029
You know, being--

09:00.517 --> 09:02.401
- an artist.
- Yeah, Bob Kane.

09:03.364 --> 09:04.562
- Was the guy let down?

09:04.624 --> 09:07.045
- It was a real, like,
Capone vault moment.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.672
We're like"what's gonna be
behind there?

09:08.672 --> 09:09.583
What's on it?"

09:09.677 --> 09:11.288
And then we open it up,
and it's just like, eh.

09:11.288 --> 09:14.285
- So not a big deal,
but I wanted to know.

09:14.285 --> 09:15.585
You know, the last thing
you want to do

09:15.585 --> 09:18.054
is end up not realizing
what you had.

09:18.054 --> 09:19.113
- Right, right, right.
- Right.

09:19.113 --> 09:21.153
- So how much do you actually
think this would be worth?

09:21.443 --> 09:23.994
- I couldn't even begin
to, uh,

09:24.211 --> 09:25.193
put a value on this.

09:25.193 --> 09:28.498
I mean, it's like finding
a signature of George Washington

09:28.498 --> 09:29.031
or something.

09:29.141 --> 09:30.835
I wouldn't take less
than 10 grand for it.

09:31.429 --> 09:32.734
- Man, you guys
are blowing me away.

09:32.734 --> 09:34.380
I've been looking
at a new Camaro.

09:34.475 --> 09:36.105
[Laughter]

09:36.105 --> 09:37.372
- It's absolutely amazing.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.650
I would bring this
to an auction house.

09:39.928 --> 09:41.159
Christie's heritage.

09:41.159 --> 09:42.477
I don't know what
you traded for it,

09:42.477 --> 09:43.270
but it looks like--

09:43.270 --> 09:44.157
it looks like you made out.

09:44.157 --> 09:45.694
- Thanks, guys.
Seriously, thanks a lot.

09:45.694 --> 09:47.780
- Thank you very much.
Thanks for bringing them in.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.720
- Take it light, fellas.
- Be well.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.879
- Take care, man.

09:52.167 --> 09:52.563
Wow.

09:52.732 --> 09:53.847
- That's a hell
of an autograph.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.468
- Doesn't get much rarer
than that.

09:57.142 --> 09:59.838
- So the store
looks less cluttered

09:59.838 --> 10:01.872
than it has
in recent memory.

10:02.114 --> 10:04.667
- It was getting a little, uh,
dicey there for a while.

10:04.811 --> 10:06.586
A store remains open
as long as we have,

10:06.586 --> 10:08.246
you start to accumulate stuff.

10:08.246 --> 10:09.272
- It was starting
to look like

10:09.272 --> 10:11.177
<i>Kevin spacey's library
in 'Se7en'.</i>

10:11.452 --> 10:14.676
Just--when they broke into his
room of weird collections,

10:14.676 --> 10:16.295
like, "we found
100,000 napkins."

10:17.917 --> 10:19.378
"A LITTLE COMPETITION".

10:25.856 --> 10:27.438
- Ming.
- What's going on?

10:27.599 --> 10:29.119
- Can you tell me
why this stuff

10:29.475 --> 10:30.518
is just piled everywhere?

10:30.583 --> 10:32.049
- It's Mike.
- Mike!

10:32.515 --> 10:33.303
- What's up, Walt?
- Hey.

10:33.469 --> 10:34.489
<i>Do you know
where these moon--</i>

10:34.489 --> 10:36.797
<i>like, all these copies
of Moon Knight came from?</i>

10:37.115 --> 10:38.513
- These are--are freebies.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.569
- They were free?
- Yep.

10:39.569 --> 10:40.673
- He told me
you had bought 'em.

10:40.896 --> 10:41.402
- [Laughs]

10:41.520 --> 10:42.906
- How in the hell
did I buy them?

10:43.083 --> 10:44.014
- You brought them up here.

10:44.204 --> 10:46.237
- Ming, you look like a donkey
wearing a straw hat.

10:47.065 --> 10:47.906
- What does that mean?

10:47.971 --> 10:49.516
[Laughter]

10:49.647 --> 10:51.526
- Stuff is coming up
from downstairs,

10:51.657 --> 10:52.736
<i>like the blob.</i>

10:53.208 --> 10:54.484
We gotta figure out
a way to move it.

10:54.484 --> 10:55.999
- All right, let's do it.
Let's find a way.

10:56.898 --> 10:58.653
- I say we just bring it
to Collingswood then.

10:59.302 --> 11:00.791
- For those
who have never been

11:00.791 --> 11:02.084
to a flea market,

11:02.160 --> 11:03.242
you're missing out.

11:03.242 --> 11:04.810
It's the great American
garage sale.

11:04.810 --> 11:05.863
But if you've never been

11:05.863 --> 11:07.917
to the Collingswood Auction
Flea Market,

11:07.917 --> 11:09.814
and you're in New Jersey,
you are missing out

11:09.814 --> 11:11.663
on a cross-section
of the fabric

11:11.981 --> 11:14.372
that makes up
the United States of America.

11:14.372 --> 11:16.575
- You take the pulse
of America right there.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.469
- You're not kidding, man.
Never mind New York and L.A.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.380
The pulse is
the Collingswood Market.

11:21.023 --> 11:23.004
- I was thinking maybe
a little competition

11:23.004 --> 11:24.433
between you, Mike, and Ming.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.775
- All right.
- Winner gets what?

11:25.818 --> 11:26.786
What do you need, Ming?

11:26.826 --> 11:28.016
What's the carrot
on the stick

11:28.016 --> 11:29.525
I can dangle in front
of your nose?

11:29.768 --> 11:30.726
- Can I have Mike's job?

11:31.362 --> 11:33.274
- No, you don't go after
a man's job.

11:33.471 --> 11:35.036
That's second only to going
after his wife.

11:35.705 --> 11:36.874
Piece of [Bleep].

11:36.892 --> 11:38.871
[Laughter]

11:40.046 --> 11:40.896
Here's what
I'm thinking then.

11:40.896 --> 11:42.707
Whoever can sell
the most of this stuff,

11:42.707 --> 11:44.722
I'll give them two weekends off
in a row.

11:45.016 --> 11:45.446
- All right.

11:45.523 --> 11:47.529
- Bryan, you got any interest
in getting in on this?

11:47.651 --> 11:50.254
- If it means Ming losing
something he loves,

11:50.254 --> 11:51.262
I'm totally in.

11:51.262 --> 11:52.651
[Laughter]

11:52.788 --> 11:54.389
- I said, divvy it up
between you three.

11:54.389 --> 11:55.932
Mike, you take
1/3 of it,

11:56.118 --> 11:57.032
ming, you take
1/3 of it,

11:57.085 --> 11:58.132
Bryan, you take
1/3 of it.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.608
Get yourselves
a table each.

11:59.779 --> 12:00.976
Sell all your stuff.

12:01.311 --> 12:03.016
Whoever brings home the most
money for their stuff--

12:03.139 --> 12:04.866
- right.
- Is the winner.

12:06.457 --> 12:08.150
"COLLINGSWOOD FLEAMARKET".

12:08.244 --> 12:16.253
¶

12:19.518 --> 12:21.324
- look who's here.

12:21.358 --> 12:22.347
Woo-hoo!

12:24.403 --> 12:26.360
Should've known you'd
be early, Ming.

12:26.401 --> 12:27.773
- Where's all your money
you made?

12:27.823 --> 12:28.915
- It's in my pocket.

12:28.947 --> 12:30.828
- You didn't make shit.
You know it.

12:30.858 --> 12:32.592
- You told us
to be there at 8:00.

12:32.613 --> 12:34.785
You got there at 7:00
to try and cut out--

12:34.841 --> 12:36.333
- you set us up
for failure.

12:36.374 --> 12:37.953
- Apple polisher,
that's what you are.

12:37.986 --> 12:39.067
[High voice]
"I'm gonna show Walt

12:39.101 --> 12:41.078
I'm the best."

12:41.109 --> 12:42.855
- But on a team, there's always
gonna be that one person

12:42.894 --> 12:43.986
whose nose is brown.

12:44.009 --> 12:45.539
- Yes. Has to be.
- There has to be,

12:45.541 --> 12:46.944
or else the team
is worthless.

12:46.964 --> 12:48.917
- Yeah.
- And we know we got that guy.

12:48.947 --> 12:51.118
And I cherish that nose,

12:51.136 --> 12:53.054
and I want you to keep it
right where it's at

12:53.089 --> 12:54.292
and never remove it.

12:54.292 --> 12:56.322
- Firmly planted
between Walt's cheeks.

12:56.740 --> 12:59.322
[Laughter]

13:00.929 --> 13:02.128
- How much is this stuff,
anyway?

13:02.142 --> 13:02.854
- [Laughing]
I don't know.

13:02.854 --> 13:04.027
You make up the prices.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.968
- Christmas is coming up,
dude.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.997
Somebody in your life must need
a dancing Bart.

13:11.526 --> 13:12.657
Stains all over him.

13:12.657 --> 13:13.550
Ming, what the hell?

13:13.842 --> 13:15.264
- That's not my--
that's your problem.

13:15.610 --> 13:16.425
It's not my problem.

13:16.761 --> 13:18.865
- [Laughing]

13:18.897 --> 13:21.833
- What are you doing?

13:21.867 --> 13:23.213
- Let the competition begin.

13:24.215 --> 13:26.496
- This is, like, the Ferrari
of the collecting world.

13:26.558 --> 13:28.913
I love the six million dollar
man so much.

13:29.426 --> 13:32.306
"COMING UP".

13:32.949 --> 13:34.021
- It's freaking me out
a little bit.

13:36.097 --> 13:38.277
"JAY AND SILENT BOB'S".

13:38.332 --> 13:39.401
- So, Bryan, what's new?

13:39.435 --> 13:41.034
- Mostly I just stand here

13:41.048 --> 13:43.887
and watch my life
pass before me.

13:43.925 --> 13:45.039
- With me.
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.073 --> 13:46.084
Actually, that's what
I do here.

13:46.108 --> 13:48.639
I watch your life pass by.

13:48.674 --> 13:49.973
[Bell rings]

13:50.007 --> 13:51.236
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

13:51.287 --> 13:52.478
-Doing pretty good.
- Oh.

13:52.514 --> 13:54.543
- I have brought some things
into your shop

13:54.584 --> 13:55.587
you might have
an interest in.

13:55.621 --> 13:57.013
- Toys.
- Yeah.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.047
I have some Megos here.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.153
- Ooh.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.827
- I got a Robin.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.857
I got a circle suit Spider-Man.
- Very cool.

14:02.878 --> 14:05.059
- And, uh, well,
this is not exactly a Mego,

14:05.090 --> 14:06.628
but this is the, uh,
Six Million Dollar Man.

14:07.206 --> 14:08.324
- Oh, this is beautiful.

14:08.363 --> 14:10.039
"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN"
"ACTION FIGURE, KENNER TOYS, 1975".

14:10.097 --> 14:13.822
"STARRING LEE MAJORS, THE TELEVISION
SERIES RAN FROM 1974-1978".

14:15.938 --> 14:17.022
- You know what that is?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.574
- Of course I do.
The telescopic sight.

14:19.616 --> 14:20.828
- That's the bionic eye.

14:20.853 --> 14:22.109
[Imitates bionic eye
sound effect]

14:22.143 --> 14:23.710
- Very nice.
Agh!

14:23.999 --> 14:24.536
Walter.

14:25.254 --> 14:26.460
Got some stuff
you need to see.

14:26.478 --> 14:27.528
- Six Million Dollar Man.

14:27.568 --> 14:29.802
I mean, how big was that
in our childhood?

14:29.824 --> 14:31.467
- The Six Million Dollar Man
was kind of like a superhero.

14:31.499 --> 14:32.506
He had strength.

14:32.544 --> 14:33.591
He could run really fast.

14:33.627 --> 14:34.992
And he was always
fighting crime,

14:35.020 --> 14:36.241
and it was badass,
because that was

14:36.289 --> 14:38.940
the closest thing
to a comic book show

14:38.955 --> 14:40.212
on TV at that point.

14:40.244 --> 14:41.311
- Yep.

14:42.334 --> 14:42.915
These are yours?

14:43.432 --> 14:44.884
- Yes, these are
from my collection.

14:45.031 --> 14:47.202
- I love the six million
dollar man so much.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.679
From the day I was born till about...
("THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN SPAWNED)

14:50.240 --> 14:51.287
age 15,
("A SPINOFF, 'THE BIONIC WOMAN, IN 1976'".)

14:51.610 --> 14:53.904
my most vivid memory is--

14:54.554 --> 14:56.328
- please say fucking
a girl, please.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.600
Please say--

14:57.606 --> 14:58.617
- I said till I was 15.

14:58.667 --> 14:59.727
- Okay.

14:59.744 --> 15:02.160
- My most cherished memory
as a child

15:02.414 --> 15:03.727
is sitting down
in front of the TV

15:03.759 --> 15:06.122
and watching Steve Austin
rip off Bigfoot's arm.

15:06.604 --> 15:07.824
Nothing else topped that.

15:08.072 --> 15:10.054
- You built your life
around this episode

15:10.054 --> 15:12.570
because finally, this dude
was gonna fight something

15:12.570 --> 15:13.974
of maybe equal strength,

15:13.974 --> 15:15.289
because you're the bionic man.

15:15.954 --> 15:17.603
And nobody else
is bionic.

15:17.603 --> 15:19.503
Like, every episode
could just end with...

15:20.880 --> 15:21.790
[Imitates slow-motion punch]
You know, justice.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.053
But if you're fighting Bigfoot,
there's a chance

15:24.053 --> 15:25.055
they could have a throwdown.

15:25.347 --> 15:27.128
And then in the midst
of this episode,

15:27.237 --> 15:29.124
doesn't he pull off
Bigfoot's arm,

15:29.160 --> 15:31.228
and it's revealed that Bigfoot
is also bionic?

15:31.272 --> 15:32.505
- Yeah, I mean--

15:32.548 --> 15:33.766
- aren't you supposed to say,
"spoiler alert,"

15:33.816 --> 15:34.844
when you say stuff
like that?

15:34.871 --> 15:36.142
- I guess.

15:36.176 --> 15:39.070
I think there's a 25-year
moratorium, though.

15:39.119 --> 15:41.213
- I had all three of these dolls
as a child, Bry.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.862
- Are those high-ticket items,
Walt?

15:42.901 --> 15:43.948
This is no cheap stuff?

15:43.981 --> 15:45.730
- Oh, this is not
cheap stuff, Bry.

15:45.748 --> 15:48.613
This is like the Ferraris
of the collecting world.

15:48.986 --> 15:50.918
- You could probably really win
your kid's respect

15:50.918 --> 15:52.138
if you had this
in your collection.

15:52.906 --> 15:54.581
- All my daughter's friends
come over, and I'm like,

15:54.663 --> 15:56.743
"come in. Look.
Six Million Dollar Man."

15:56.897 --> 15:58.265
- "Come on.
Come on, girls.

15:58.298 --> 16:00.132
Walt wants to talk
about dolls again."

16:01.136 --> 16:02.420
- [Guffaws]

16:02.451 --> 16:03.767
What would you think would be
a fair price?

16:03.945 --> 16:05.798
- Could you still look
through the back of the box...

16:05.798 --> 16:06.992
- You can.
- To see through Steve's eye?

16:06.992 --> 16:07.500
- You can.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.177
- Uh, the plastic in the window
was still crisp?

16:10.177 --> 16:10.843
It was still nice?

16:10.843 --> 16:11.857
- It is.
- All right.

16:13.388 --> 16:14.911
200?
- Less.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.201
- Get outta here.

16:16.313 --> 16:17.482
- So what are you
looking for

16:17.482 --> 16:18.618
for the six million dollar
man?

16:18.804 --> 16:21.705
- For you guys, I can do, uh,
250 for him,

16:21.897 --> 16:23.288
if you wanted him, 250.

16:27.434 --> 16:28.993
- I don't want to insult you
or beat you up.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.395
But, um, is there any way
you could take 150?

16:37.408 --> 16:38.906
- I honestly could not.

16:40.324 --> 16:42.404
It's an unfortunate thing,
but I like you.

16:44.039 --> 16:46.321
And because I like you,
you know, um,

16:47.436 --> 16:51.169
I could do this one here
for 200, if you want.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.720
- Would you do 175?

16:56.755 --> 16:57.496
Cash?

16:58.941 --> 17:01.772
- [Sighs heavily]

17:02.205 --> 17:04.213
If you wanna do 185,
it's yours.

17:04.213 --> 17:05.046
You can have it I here.

17:05.077 --> 17:06.034
Other than that, I--

17:06.801 --> 17:08.378
that is the absolute,
like--

17:11.301 --> 17:13.226
- what if I gave you guys
the extra 10 bucks?

17:14.154 --> 17:15.448
- Would you do that?
- You'd do that?

17:15.448 --> 17:16.895
- I'll kick in the extra ten,
yeah.

17:17.001 --> 17:17.780
- You'd do that?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.387
- 185.
- 185.

17:20.162 --> 17:21.371
- I get to look
through his eye.

17:22.589 --> 17:23.193
That's all I ask.

17:23.193 --> 17:24.810
- You can look through the eye
as many times

17:24.810 --> 17:25.448
as you want.

17:25.551 --> 17:26.469
- I'm a part owner.

17:26.873 --> 17:28.277
And I can't wait
to go tell my girlfriend.

17:28.295 --> 17:30.175
[Laughter]

17:38.177 --> 17:39.623
"DEATH OF A SALESMAN".

17:41.115 --> 17:42.033
- Great deals here.

17:42.704 --> 17:44.176
Action figures, comics.

17:44.649 --> 17:45.684
- You like wearing shirts?

17:46.086 --> 17:48.222
- $3?
- $3 for that.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.927
Come on.
All right.

17:50.993 --> 17:53.191
Junior makes a purchase.
[Cha-ching]

17:53.226 --> 17:54.974
- Everything 5 bucks.

17:55.021 --> 17:56.220
- Thanks a lot, man.

17:56.261 --> 17:57.361
- Sure thing.
Thank you.

17:57.381 --> 17:58.410
[Cha-ching]
- I'll be back.

17:58.496 --> 17:59.662
- We'll be here.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.933
- You know,
these retail for $50.

18:00.964 --> 18:02.713
- How much it is?
- 10 bucks.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.623
- All right,
I'll take it.

18:04.670 --> 18:05.710
[Cha-ching]

18:05.739 --> 18:07.148
- Thank you very much.

18:07.181 --> 18:09.377
ming, I'm breaking a sweat
over here.

18:09.407 --> 18:10.836
- Don't bother me.
I'm making a sale.

18:10.867 --> 18:12.516
<i>- X-Men: Evolution colossus,</i>

18:12.535 --> 18:14.235
beautiful,
beautiful piece.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.685
[Cha-ching]

18:15.703 --> 18:17.683
- Card's a little bent,
but it's still a good price.

18:17.702 --> 18:18.684
[Cha-ching]

18:18.704 --> 18:20.172
Ringle, ringle.

18:20.223 --> 18:22.389
Coins as they jingle.

18:22.426 --> 18:24.059
- Mike, what do you got
so far?

18:24.091 --> 18:25.761
- About 40.
Bryan?

18:25.775 --> 18:27.144
- Think I've made, like,
300.

18:27.180 --> 18:28.626
- Let's see it.
- [Chuckles]

18:28.664 --> 18:30.895
- I'm not just gonna flash
that kind of cash around here.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.522
- 31, Mike.
I'm catching up to you.

18:32.577 --> 18:33.628
- All right.

18:33.658 --> 18:34.954
- Even though
you gave me the crap,

18:34.990 --> 18:36.037
I'm still gonna move it.

18:36.069 --> 18:37.406
You have an empty cart.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.122
You want to fill it up
with some good stuff?

18:39.168 --> 18:40.572
Fill it up
with some good stuff.

18:40.606 --> 18:41.945
- Oh, sure.
- Discounted toys.

18:41.979 --> 18:43.146
- Let me see
what you have.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.063
- Discounted, stained-up,
androgynous Bart.

18:45.113 --> 18:46.225
- Good stuff.

18:46.279 --> 18:49.192
- He went back
into the world of sales,

18:49.221 --> 18:50.924
actually dealing
with the public.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.182
And not only did you deal
with the public,

18:52.224 --> 18:53.883
but you dealt
with the Collingswood public.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.812
- Yeah.
- What was that like?

18:55.855 --> 18:57.067
- It was a nightmare.

18:57.101 --> 18:58.772
I can't imagine
this being my life.

18:58.816 --> 19:00.625
- Why? You don't see it

19:00.627 --> 19:02.626
as the magical Asgardian place
like we see it?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.463
Like you cross a rainbow bridge
to a world of goods?

19:05.484 --> 19:06.889
- You know,
it's probably the customers.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.541
It's prob--it comes down
to I just don't want to deal

19:08.554 --> 19:09.547
with peope, you know?

19:09.587 --> 19:10.670
[Laughter]

19:10.704 --> 19:13.676
[Bouncy music]

19:13.704 --> 19:14.895
¶

19:14.940 --> 19:16.441
you look like a woman
with taste, right?

19:16.474 --> 19:18.027
Let me intro--

19:18.066 --> 19:20.515
what?
- Don't do that.

19:20.549 --> 19:22.129
- You're a collector
of fine art?

19:22.165 --> 19:23.425
I got fine art right here.

19:23.459 --> 19:25.085
- [Laughs]
- What?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.631
There's a good hour where
I'm like, "wow, this is awesome.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.721
Look at all this stuff."

19:28.760 --> 19:29.968
And then after that,
I'm like,

19:30.012 --> 19:31.309
"oh, my God,
look at these people."

19:31.344 --> 19:33.390
Like, the reason they're not
in the mall

19:33.442 --> 19:35.065
is because they're not allowed
in the mall.

19:35.093 --> 19:36.861
[Laughter]

19:36.898 --> 19:38.559
I'm making a sale over here.

19:38.588 --> 19:39.701
- Let me come back,
but then--

19:39.735 --> 19:41.131
- oh, you're not coming back.

19:43.085 --> 19:44.469
They never come back.

19:47.615 --> 19:49.021
"COMING UP".

19:49.078 --> 19:50.381
- Wow.

19:50.418 --> 19:52.176
Must be something
pretty valuable in that bag.

19:53.584 --> 19:55.724
"JAY AND SILENT BOB'S
SECRET STASH".

19:57.561 --> 19:58.535
- Mike, how was your weekend?

19:58.692 --> 19:59.679
- It was good, thanks, Ming.

19:59.679 --> 20:01.481
<i>Cooked dinner for the family.
We watched Rango.</i>

20:02.286 --> 20:03.431
<i>- Rango, the movie Rango?</i>

20:03.881 --> 20:06.366
- No, just some dude in our
neighborhood's named Rango.

20:06.381 --> 20:08.413
So we just followed him around
for a couple of hours.

20:09.461 --> 20:10.454
- What are you talking about?

20:11.775 --> 20:12.307
- Hi.

20:12.489 --> 20:13.374
[Chuckles]

20:13.744 --> 20:15.433
[Eerie music]

20:15.576 --> 20:16.862
- Uh, hi.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.622
Lovely child.
- Thank you.

20:19.674 --> 20:21.982
I'm actually looking
to sell him.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.027
- Uh.
- Is that life-sized?

20:32.437 --> 20:34.402
- Yes, it's considered
life-sized.

20:34.402 --> 20:35.083
[Chuckles]

20:36.078 --> 20:37.199
- Okay, why you looking
to sell it?

20:37.288 --> 20:39.320
- Well, I'm starting up
my own little business

20:39.320 --> 20:40.333
of making my own dolls.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.568
I have a couple
of other Chuckys,

20:42.568 --> 20:45.229
so, um, I think maybe
I could part with one.

20:45.659 --> 20:46.167
Maybe.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.100
- Okay.
- It's creepy.

20:48.267 --> 20:49.614
It's freaking me out
a little bit.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.333
You know who Chucky
was named after?

20:53.031 --> 20:54.241
- Charles Manson?
- That's right.

20:54.404 --> 20:56.564
His full name in the movie
was, uh, Charles--

20:56.564 --> 20:58.155
- Lee ray.
- Charles Lee Ray.

20:58.155 --> 21:01.188
So Charles for Charles Manson,
Lee for Lee Harvey Oswald,

21:01.872 --> 21:03.237
and Ray for James Earl Ray.

21:03.237 --> 21:03.745
- Okay.

21:03.856 --> 21:05.794
- They tried to make it
a somewhat serious horror.

21:05.794 --> 21:06.886
- I don't think
it was ever treated

21:06.886 --> 21:08.790
as "serious" horror,

21:08.996 --> 21:10.492
a little doll running around.

21:11.016 --> 21:11.947
You collect a lot of dolls?

21:11.983 --> 21:12.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:12.979 --> 21:14.313
- Yeah, a lot.

21:16.131 --> 21:17.366
- Who manufactured the doll?

21:17.366 --> 21:18.826
It doesn't look
like a McFarlane.

21:18.874 --> 21:19.844
"McFARLANE TOYS IS OWNED BY LEGENDARY
COMIC BOOK ARTIST TODD McFARLANE".

21:19.844 --> 21:21.125
- No, Spencer's
was putting them out.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.445
- Spencer's, huh?
- Yes.

21:22.445 --> 21:24.141
- Mcfarlane may be
a little bit more

21:24.717 --> 21:25.893
detail-oriented,

21:25.893 --> 21:27.333
little bit harder
to come by.

21:27.437 --> 21:28.952
- Do you have the box,
by any chance?

21:29.182 --> 21:29.771
- No.

21:29.959 --> 21:31.360
- Rule of thumb,
always keep the box,

21:31.609 --> 21:33.839
especially if there's something
you want to resell.

21:33.935 --> 21:35.367
- Well, he's part
of the family, you know.

21:35.367 --> 21:37.514
We don't keep family members
in boxes usually.

21:37.970 --> 21:40.281
[Chuckles]

21:40.321 --> 21:42.033
- You don't sell family members
either, though.

21:42.432 --> 21:44.200
Well, not in this
day and age.

21:45.273 --> 21:46.437
What was really weird

21:46.437 --> 21:48.616
was that she almost treated
the doll

21:48.616 --> 21:52.381
like it was a living,
breathing person.

21:52.390 --> 21:53.881
Like--or it was like a child
to her.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.192
It was really strange.

21:56.192 --> 21:58.703
- This was not an--
a teenager.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.996
But she's walking around
in a corset

22:00.996 --> 22:03.699
with a doll tucked under her arm
that she thinks is real.

22:03.994 --> 22:04.681
- Yes.

22:04.940 --> 22:06.327
- Why did you not
immediately throw

22:06.327 --> 22:07.375
a butterfly net
over her

22:08.260 --> 22:09.028
and haul her off?

22:09.164 --> 22:10.939
- It's not really our job
to do that, is it?

22:10.939 --> 22:13.282
- It's everybody's job
to clean up the streets.

22:13.282 --> 22:14.670
You can't just be like,
"oh, we're busy.

22:14.670 --> 22:16.515
We're at work.
We're at our nie-to-fivers."

22:16.515 --> 22:18.460
- But our first priority
is to stash.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.578
Can we make money
off the mentally ill?

22:20.578 --> 22:22.670
[Laughter]

22:22.670 --> 22:24.971
What are you looking to get
today for the Chucky doll?

22:25.744 --> 22:28.129
- I was thinking, like,
400 to 500.

22:31.929 --> 22:33.758
- I could probably do
100 on it.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.512
- 100?
- Yeah.

22:40.742 --> 22:41.962
- No, I can't do it.

22:42.014 --> 22:43.435
I can't.
Not for 100. Nope.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.227
- Sure?

22:44.227 --> 22:45.967
- I don't even know
if I could do it for 500.

22:47.901 --> 22:49.156
I mean, if you don't want
to buy him--

22:49.417 --> 22:50.669
- yeah, um, unfortunately,

22:50.668 --> 22:53.269
on this piece,
that's probably the best

22:53.269 --> 22:55.173
that we're gonna be able
to offer you today is 100.

22:55.561 --> 22:57.702
- Ugh. Well, he's happy
to come home with me, so.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.074
- I bet he is.

23:00.424 --> 23:01.482
- [Chuckles]
I feel bad.

23:01.482 --> 23:02.891
Like, I think he's,
like, sad.

23:05.064 --> 23:05.969
[Baby voice]
Yeah, aww.

23:06.241 --> 23:07.630
- Thank you for coming in.
- Okay.

23:07.630 --> 23:09.295
- Thank you for showing us.
- Thank you, yeah.

23:09.295 --> 23:10.821
[Baby voice]
Bye-bye. Say, "bye."

23:10.899 --> 23:11.678
[Chucky voice]
Bye.

23:11.678 --> 23:13.010
- Bye, Chucky.
- Later, Chuck.

23:13.010 --> 23:14.138
- [Chuckles]

23:16.364 --> 23:18.421
- That was scary.
[Laughter]

23:19.009 --> 23:20.828
"ON THE AIR" .

23:20.876 --> 23:23.209
<i>- My favorite horror flick
of all time is The Shining</i>

23:23.209 --> 23:25.987
because the same image
that scared me when I was ten

23:25.987 --> 23:27.308
still scares me today.

23:27.610 --> 23:29.693
Kid's on a big wheel,
going along the carpet.

23:29.914 --> 23:30.743
Turns a corner.

23:30.892 --> 23:32.551
There are those twin girls,

23:32.551 --> 23:34.732
the most terrifying image
ever captured on film.

23:34.732 --> 23:36.623
Still to this day,
when that moment happens,

23:36.898 --> 23:38.355
I wet myself just a little.

23:38.853 --> 23:41.195
A little comes out, you know,
and I have to excuse myself.

23:41.354 --> 23:42.880
- What about you, Ming?
Your favorite horror movie?

23:43.093 --> 23:45.087
<i>- Mine's always been Nightmare
On Elm Street, the first one.</i>

23:45.087 --> 23:46.332
That one's always
freaked me out.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.373
- What's your favorite
horror movie?

23:47.373 --> 23:49.449
- I don't have to tell you.
- You go, uh,

23:49.496 --> 23:51.194
classic Universal monsters.

23:51.194 --> 23:54.101
You want to see
things with fangs, capes.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.067
- Yes.
- Uh--

23:56.079 --> 23:57.654
- I am not pissing my pants
over that.

23:57.765 --> 24:00.098
Black and white, slow pacing,
it's not scary.

24:00.271 --> 24:01.111
- I'm with him, man.

24:01.111 --> 24:02.278
If you really want
to scare people,

24:02.278 --> 24:04.239
you gotta give 'em a notion
like this could happen.

24:04.472 --> 24:05.995
And Frankenstein can't happen.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.260
- Neither can Freddy Krueger.

24:08.226 --> 24:09.640
- He's got you there
on Freddy Krueger.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.889
- Some guy could put
a glove on with knives and--

24:11.889 --> 24:13.582
okay, maybe not terrorize people
in dreams, but--

24:13.582 --> 24:14.586
- but he molested kids.

24:14.586 --> 24:15.602
That was their origin,

24:15.602 --> 24:17.391
was in reality,
and that was terrifying.

24:17.391 --> 24:19.153
- Frankenstein threw a child
in the lake, remember?

24:19.153 --> 24:20.654
- But he was friendly
to her at first.

24:21.508 --> 24:22.441
- Tell that to the parents.

24:22.624 --> 24:24.056
[Laughter]

24:24.299 --> 24:26.010
"THE ART OF THE SALE" .

24:26.743 --> 24:27.671
- Look at that.

24:27.724 --> 24:29.349
That's fine stitching.

24:29.399 --> 24:30.273
"BRYAN'S TOTAL $30.00".

24:30.313 --> 24:31.612
- Awesome. 5 bucks.

24:31.665 --> 24:32.641
"MIKE'S TOTAL $41.00".

24:32.676 --> 24:33.719
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

24:33.957 --> 24:36.060
- The stuff on his table--
I think he stole it.

24:36.243 --> 24:37.297
"MING'S TOTAL $34.00".

24:37.485 --> 24:39.176
- I got a fish on the hook
right here.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.054
- I got more over here
if you wanna look at them.

24:42.102 --> 24:43.460
- Don't go to his table.
- And they're better.

24:43.503 --> 24:45.170
- Don't go to his table?
- How you doing?

24:45.361 --> 24:46.836
Look at all
of my beautiful items here.

24:47.121 --> 24:48.318
This one I don't want
to let go.

24:48.467 --> 24:51.624
Retail price, 59.99.
Can be yours for 20.

24:52.118 --> 24:53.196
- Don't buy his garbage.
- [Giggles]

24:54.435 --> 24:55.432
- But look at this stuff.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.605
Way more reasonably priced.

24:58.421 --> 25:00.159
Those? Those are only $1.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.286
- Two of those.
- There you go.

25:02.286 --> 25:03.062
- 15?

25:04.534 --> 25:06.184
- That's what he does.
He tries to steal all my sales.

25:06.235 --> 25:08.304
Tries to take bread
out of my children's mouths.

25:08.304 --> 25:09.898
Greedy capitalist.

25:10.407 --> 25:11.025
Thank you.

25:11.794 --> 25:13.174
- See you later.
- Thank you.

25:13.733 --> 25:15.539
- Dude, you suck
at salesmanship.

25:16.637 --> 25:17.305
- We'll see.

25:17.719 --> 25:19.545
- I tried to make it fun,
and I thought for sure

25:19.545 --> 25:20.741
that they would work together.

25:20.783 --> 25:21.578
- Mm-hmm.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.299
- Like, as a team.
- He couldn't work with him.

25:23.299 --> 25:25.211
Ming is neat.
He's a metrosexual.

25:25.403 --> 25:26.063
This guy--

25:26.729 --> 25:27.767
he's so sloppy.

25:27.767 --> 25:28.989
Everything's haphazard.

25:28.989 --> 25:30.783
He--they--they could--
it's like Oscar and Felix.

25:30.783 --> 25:31.965
They can't work together.

25:32.719 --> 25:34.116
- You guys wanna buy some stuff
over here?

25:34.694 --> 25:36.948
Nothing? Nothing?
Nothing piques your interest?

25:37.121 --> 25:38.445
- You had him.
You had him.

25:39.523 --> 25:40.312
Let him go.

25:41.016 --> 25:41.578
How you doing?

25:41.684 --> 25:43.047
- How much are these?
- $1.

25:43.434 --> 25:44.978
Look at that.
Cover print 20.

25:45.342 --> 25:47.358
- Do you happen to know if we're
near an elementary school?

25:47.358 --> 25:49.109
He's not allowed
to be within a thousand feet.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.935
[Chuckles]

25:52.264 --> 25:53.579
- How you doing?
- Okay.

25:54.018 --> 25:55.685
- Look at these
beautiful action figures here.

25:56.310 --> 25:57.495
Still in their packaging.

25:57.495 --> 25:59.242
- Bread makers, like bun makers?
- Bread makers?

25:59.442 --> 26:00.342
What about--

26:00.391 --> 26:01.511
you could put bread
on this plate.

26:01.511 --> 26:03.142
- You could.
- Buy it.

26:03.318 --> 26:04.195
Look.
[Glass shatters]

26:04.399 --> 26:05.713
- Oh!
- We don't care about money.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.566
We just care
about selling stuff.

26:08.311 --> 26:09.946
We just want you
to be happy.

26:10.397 --> 26:11.702
<i>- I know, great.
- We're loco with sales.</i>

26:11.738 --> 26:13.383
I'll wreck his whole table

26:13.385 --> 26:15.072
to prove how dedicated
we are.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.990
- What the hell, man?

26:17.039 --> 26:19.143
You owe me $10 for that.

26:19.164 --> 26:20.808
- Well, you're down
10 bucks now.

26:20.841 --> 26:22.345
- 'Scuse me.
- Hey.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.944
- You don't do this
to these people.

26:24.970 --> 26:26.329
- No?

26:26.381 --> 26:27.783
- You don't destroy
somebody else's things.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.704
- Yeah, thank you.
- But I bought it.

26:29.733 --> 26:31.044
- You leave him alone.
- I bought it.

26:31.244 --> 26:32.601
Didn't I buy it?
- No.

26:32.651 --> 26:33.673
- No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.

26:33.730 --> 26:35.625
If you bought it,
you destroy it.

26:35.659 --> 26:36.679
- All right.
I want two plates.

26:36.714 --> 26:38.140
- Give him
give him.

26:38.195 --> 26:39.214
Give him.

26:39.247 --> 26:40.868
- Yu got change
of a 20?

26:40.902 --> 26:43.110
- No, no, no, no--
hey, hey, hey!

26:43.148 --> 26:44.785
- There we go, okay.
- That's fine. That's fine.

26:44.816 --> 26:46.918
You can do that
if it's yours.

26:46.966 --> 26:49.317
- Where's your table?
- Right over here.

26:49.369 --> 26:51.292
- I might come by later.
- You can come by.

26:51.321 --> 26:52.977
If you destroy it,
you pay for it.

26:52.977 --> 26:53.628
- All right.

26:54.309 --> 26:55.593
I learned
a valuable lesson today.

26:55.801 --> 26:56.376
- Yes.

26:56.471 --> 26:58.155
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

26:58.210 --> 26:59.365
Thank you for standing up
for me.

26:59.365 --> 27:00.420
- All right.
- I appreciate it.

27:03.171 --> 27:04.139
- I'm not paying
for those plates.

27:04.139 --> 27:06.027
- Gimme my 40 bucks back.
- Give him his 40 bucks back.

27:06.152 --> 27:07.183
- Here, you can have 20.

27:07.686 --> 27:08.884
- I'm not paying
for those plates.

27:08.884 --> 27:10.506
- Gimme the other 20.
- I'm not giving it back.

27:11.195 --> 27:13.216
- You better keep a close eye
on those plates, Ming.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.620
Until I get that 20 back,
they're at risk.

27:17.217 --> 27:17.867
- Wow.

27:17.921 --> 27:19.117
"COMING UP".

27:19.139 --> 27:21.203
There must be something
pretty valuable in that bag.

27:23.151 --> 27:24.861
"ON THE AIR".

27:25.901 --> 27:27.197
- Have you ever thought
about, like,

27:27.247 --> 27:29.040
could you or would you ever

27:29.304 --> 27:30.699
give up everything
you have

27:30.930 --> 27:31.974
to become a superhero?

27:32.074 --> 27:32.914
- I don't know.

27:33.261 --> 27:35.180
But there were times
where I wanted to.

27:35.180 --> 27:36.622
I was so into Batman

27:36.821 --> 27:39.022
that I'd wear that
long leather coat,

27:39.122 --> 27:41.460
and I had the bat t-shirt
under it and whatnot.

27:41.866 --> 27:43.944
And I remember, like,
I was dating this girl

27:43.944 --> 27:45.325
that worked
at the pharmacy.

27:45.325 --> 27:46.758
And I loved--
do you remember, uh,

27:46.905 --> 27:49.574
<i>Neil Gaiman wrote
a black orchid mini-series?</i>

27:49.936 --> 27:51.935
And in it,
Batman tells her,

27:52.049 --> 27:53.834
"go to Gotham.
Seek this man.

27:54.016 --> 27:54.898
Give him this."

27:55.046 --> 27:56.743
And he gives her a card,
and it just simply has

27:56.743 --> 27:58.233
the bat symbol on it.

27:58.397 --> 27:59.897
So I'm dating this chick.

27:59.897 --> 28:01.840
She had this car.
She had a little Toyota.

28:02.110 --> 28:04.606
Under the windshield,
I put one of those cards.

28:04.606 --> 28:05.535
I made my own.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.923
So she came
out the store.

28:06.923 --> 28:07.980
She goes to the windshield,

28:07.980 --> 28:09.204
lifts it up,
sees this thing,

28:09.643 --> 28:11.644
flips it,
and it says, "look up."

28:11.860 --> 28:14.100
And then she looked up,
and I was standing on the roof

28:14.380 --> 28:15.713
of Bayshore Pharmacy...

28:17.194 --> 28:19.472
In my long coat,
in the night sky.

28:19.472 --> 28:21.420
I'm backed by the moon
and stuff.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.002
And then it was so bad,
'cause I was like,

28:23.002 --> 28:24.936
"can you bring your car around
so I can jump off?

28:25.689 --> 28:26.817
I gotta get off this roof."

28:26.897 --> 28:28.298
- And what if she just threw
the card away?

28:28.298 --> 28:29.717
Would you have been like,
"whoa, whoa, whoa!"

28:29.717 --> 28:32.022
- "I said look up!
Batman needs you!"

28:35.032 --> 28:36.617
"I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN".

28:36.673 --> 28:37.922
- if you had
Richie rich money,

28:38.043 --> 28:39.396
would you dress differently?

28:39.396 --> 28:40.879
- I would dress nicer,
most definitely.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.529
- This guy wears $75 t-shirts.

28:43.942 --> 28:45.873
- And $200 jeans.
That's true.

28:45.873 --> 28:47.322
- 300. $300 jeans.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.026
- You have pair
of $300 jeans?

28:49.026 --> 28:49.791
- I'm wearing them right now.

28:49.939 --> 28:51.794
- How's your wife let you
get away with buying $300 jeans?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.930
- They were a gift.
- Yeah, okay.

28:53.961 --> 28:54.824
It changes a little bit.

28:54.824 --> 28:56.969
But who would buy you
a $300 pair of jeans?

28:57.175 --> 28:58.922
- I did--I did a favor
for somebody.

28:59.064 --> 29:00.805
- Some guy dressed like
Richie rich was like,

29:00.805 --> 29:01.621
[British accent]
"Hello, dear sir.

29:01.621 --> 29:03.379
How would you like
to earn some jeans?"

29:04.719 --> 29:06.345
- [Britis accent] "Ironically,
by taking them off."

29:06.345 --> 29:07.816
[Laughter]
[Bell rings]

29:08.217 --> 29:09.810
Hey, how you doing?
- All right. How you doing?

29:09.810 --> 29:11.642
- Welcome to Jay and silent
Bob's--I'm Walter.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.772
- I've got two things
you might be interested in.

29:13.772 --> 29:14.826
- Check this out, Ming.

29:15.003 --> 29:15.999
- Oh, yes.

29:16.224 --> 29:17.883
- This must be something
pretty valuable

29:17.883 --> 29:18.504
in that bag.

29:18.877 --> 29:19.920
- Yeah.
[Chuckles]

29:19.920 --> 29:21.000
- That's a little extreme.

29:22.145 --> 29:23.432
- What was in it?
What did he--

29:23.469 --> 29:25.142
- well, what do you think
would be in it?

29:25.235 --> 29:27.160
Like, what would be worthy
a collectible?

29:27.639 --> 29:30.472
<i>An action #1,
a detective #27?</i>

29:30.548 --> 29:32.726
- Something
of historical significance.

29:33.267 --> 29:34.318
Hitler's brain?

29:34.318 --> 29:35.594
[Laughter]

29:36.084 --> 29:37.055
- The first thing
I've got here

29:37.055 --> 29:39.777
<i>is a Dawn Of The Dead
British lobby card set</i>

29:39.777 --> 29:43.134
released in June of 1980.

29:43.277 --> 29:45.456
"LOBBY CARD SET,
'DAWN OF THE DEAD', 1980".

29:45.488 --> 29:47.924
"DAWN" WAS THE FIRST FILM IN THE
SERIES TO LABEL THE WALKING DEAD 'ZOMBIES'.

29:48.111 --> 29:51.059
<i>- So obviously, they retitled it
zombies in britain?</i>

29:52.557 --> 29:54.923
There's this,
and then there's

29:55.104 --> 29:56.921
<i>a Dawn Of The Dead
one-sheet.</i>

29:56.936 --> 29:58.450
- You mean the movie poster.

29:58.489 --> 30:03.979
"MADE FOR JUST OVER $500 K, 'DAWN OF
THE DEAD' GROSSED OVER $55 MILLION".

30:04.280 --> 30:05.427
- Yes, it is.

30:05.461 --> 30:07.662
- Be a nice piece to have
on our wall.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.848
I think we can move it.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.531
Let's get down to business.

30:10.531 --> 30:12.412
- Oh, boy. Okay.
- The bee's knees.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.490
How much are we looking for
for both of these?

30:14.770 --> 30:16.120
- Both?
- How much are you looking for?

30:16.884 --> 30:17.511
- Well...

30:18.264 --> 30:19.402
This is a very rare set.

30:20.292 --> 30:21.743
I was looking for 800
for the set.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.119
- $800?
- Yeah.

30:23.536 --> 30:24.812
Looking about 200 for this.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.582
- Okay, so $1,000.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.690
Unfortunately, I'm just not
that well versed

30:28.690 --> 30:30.542
in movie memorabilia.

30:30.542 --> 30:33.394
Um, would you have any objection
to me making a call

30:33.394 --> 30:35.985
to a Buddy of mine who has
a better idea...

30:35.985 --> 30:37.248
- No, not at all.

30:37.248 --> 30:38.355
- About this kind
of merchandise?

30:38.685 --> 30:39.808
- Not at all.
- You got a few minutes?

30:39.980 --> 30:41.775
- Let me guess,
this is the kind of situation

30:41.783 --> 30:43.363
that calls
for Robert Bruce.

30:43.621 --> 30:45.243
- Right on the money.
- I know you guys are like,

30:45.243 --> 30:46.878
"we call in Robert Bruce
'cause he's the expert."

30:46.902 --> 30:48.558
But really it's like,
"we call in Robert Bruce

30:48.558 --> 30:50.078
"when he can deal
with the whack jobs

30:50.078 --> 30:51.285
we don't want to deal with."
[Laughter]

30:52.786 --> 30:54.252
- I'm a pop culturist,
is what I am.

30:54.444 --> 30:56.480
- Okay.
- I specialize in collectibles.

30:56.659 --> 30:59.604
Toys, comics.
As far as the poster goes,

30:59.604 --> 31:04.149
American posters, high-end
is about $400-$450 or so.

31:04.485 --> 31:06.588
But those are the high-end
posters, this is not.

31:06.588 --> 31:08.808
This was a folded poster
that somebody rolled,

31:09.212 --> 31:10.601
which brings
the condition way off.

31:11.598 --> 31:13.676
It should be
mounted and framed.

31:14.872 --> 31:16.879
The odd thing is that
it's an Australian version,

31:16.879 --> 31:18.298
it's not
an American version.

31:18.597 --> 31:20.557
- Which is why it's here.
[Laughs]

31:20.839 --> 31:21.610
- Did you hear that?

31:21.610 --> 31:24.237
<i>- If--if someone's gonna buy
a dawn of the dead poster,</i>

31:24.237 --> 31:26.133
- they want an American poster.
- Right.

31:26.732 --> 31:29.388
- Being Australian, there's
a lot of these things out there.

31:29.753 --> 31:30.234
- Sure.

31:30.665 --> 31:32.443
- I think retail
would be $200.

31:33.113 --> 31:34.521
- The retail.
- That's retail.

31:34.661 --> 31:35.947
If I was gonna buy this,

31:36.508 --> 31:37.972
in the condition
it's in now,

31:39.804 --> 31:41.354
I would probably
pay half that.

31:41.522 --> 31:42.399
- On a good day.

31:43.271 --> 31:45.127
You can say
anything you want about rob,

31:45.509 --> 31:48.779
but that guy knows
the value of a collectible.

31:48.779 --> 31:50.631
- It's a nice set.
- Mm-hmm.

31:50.665 --> 31:53.193
- You told the guys how much
you thought it was worth?

31:53.532 --> 31:55.396
- Uh, I told them
I wanted $800 for it.

31:57.202 --> 31:59.378
- Yeah, I mean,
the lobby cards are nice,

31:59.378 --> 32:01.412
but these things
sell all the time.

32:02.535 --> 32:04.102
I mean, you can find singles
("LOBBY CARDS WERE DISPLAYED IN

32:04.385 --> 32:06.767
for $25 to $35 apiece.
AMERICAN THEATERS AS EARLY AS 1910").

32:06.789 --> 32:08.644
- I'm not so sure
I agree with that, but...

32:08.644 --> 32:10.363
- No, no.
That's reality.

32:10.517 --> 32:11.157
- Okay.

32:11.566 --> 32:13.178
I know the value
of what I've seen,

32:13.317 --> 32:15.705
and this stuff isn't
going to go down in value.

32:15.827 --> 32:17.071
- You may want to
take a look,

32:17.098 --> 32:18.548
'cause the market's
changed a lot on these.

32:19.072 --> 32:20.788
- Okay.
- So putting this set together,

32:20.873 --> 32:24.140
you're looking probably
for about under $300.

32:24.140 --> 32:24.762
- No.

32:25.305 --> 32:26.999
- And you're looking
for 1,000, so I don't--

32:27.367 --> 32:29.506
I don't even know how that's,
like, in the same...

32:30.377 --> 32:31.417
- Universe.
- General vicinity.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.213
- Then...I can't let it go
for that much.

32:34.303 --> 32:36.913
- He laid it all out.
I mean, the way he negotiates,

32:37.091 --> 32:39.135
it's like watching
a wolf hunt.

32:39.503 --> 32:42.397
It's like watching a lion
devour an elk.

32:42.490 --> 32:45.028
A lion doesn't have
to tiptoe around its prey.

32:45.211 --> 32:47.893
A lion just takes it
by the throat, rips it out,

32:48.090 --> 32:50.587
and then smiles at you
while you're dying and bleeding.

32:50.587 --> 32:53.041
[Laughter]

32:53.117 --> 32:54.203
All right, so...

32:54.381 --> 32:55.815
Wish we could've
did business, but...

32:55.815 --> 32:56.652
- Thanks, Andrew.
- Thanks a lot.

32:56.652 --> 32:57.962
- Thanks, Andrew.
- All right.

32:58.225 --> 32:59.843
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.
- Thank you.

33:00.161 --> 33:02.565
- Whew! Did you--
you could feel the machismo

33:02.565 --> 33:04.505
in the room there, man.
It was getting heated!

33:04.505 --> 33:05.636
- You need to
understand something.

33:05.636 --> 33:07.132
That guy
was not a novice.

33:07.132 --> 33:09.126
- Have you ever negotiated
in front of your wife like that?

33:09.126 --> 33:11.194
I mean, that was a--
that was a turn on, wasn't it?

33:11.194 --> 33:12.531
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, it was just, like,

33:12.531 --> 33:13.927
I've never seen you
in that mode.

33:14.068 --> 33:14.867
- Well, you know.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.993
- When I'm in doubt,
call Rob Bruce.

33:16.993 --> 33:17.843
- There you go.
- Right, even better.

33:18.078 --> 33:19.941
- No matter
what the situation, Ming.

33:20.115 --> 33:23.105
I've always maintained
if I thought I could convert

33:23.105 --> 33:24.794
Rob Bruce to become
part of our team,

33:24.794 --> 33:25.948
I would.
- You would.

33:25.948 --> 33:27.980
He's kind of like
the fifth Beatle, if you will.

33:28.047 --> 33:31.358
In a just world,
all the stuff he knows

33:31.372 --> 33:33.697
about the obscure
would get him laid.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.681
Like, that would be something

33:34.737 --> 33:36.133
that women
would find attractive.

33:36.146 --> 33:37.654
Like, "you know
a lot about stuff

33:37.688 --> 33:39.829
"nobody likes
or cares about.

33:40.288 --> 33:41.649
I need to be with you."
[Laughter]

33:44.403 --> 33:45.966
"SELLOUTS".

33:46.028 --> 33:47.344
- Hello, ma'am.
How are you doing?

33:47.376 --> 33:48.623
"MING'S TOTAL $39.00".

33:49.825 --> 33:50.667
"MIKE'S TOTAL $44.00".

33:51.797 --> 33:54.020
- How much are these?
- For those? Those are $2 each.

33:54.435 --> 33:55.670
"BRYAN'S TOTAL $32.00".

33:55.898 --> 33:57.452
[Sighs]

33:58.052 --> 33:59.811
Now what, Ming?
Go home?

33:59.811 --> 34:01.319
- Not until everything's
off the table.

34:01.677 --> 34:02.926
- The rest of my table?

34:03.213 --> 34:05.539
Yours for the low,
low price of 10 bucks.

34:06.841 --> 34:08.364
- Done.
- Beautiful.

34:08.539 --> 34:10.060
I'm even gonna
put it in a box for you.

34:10.088 --> 34:10.998
- Thank you, bro.

34:11.041 --> 34:11.942
- 10 bucks.

34:12.428 --> 34:14.123
I heard that's
the going price for a table.

34:14.275 --> 34:15.145
- Done.

34:15.337 --> 34:16.534
- [Laughs]

34:17.889 --> 34:20.178
Fire sale.
Guess what, Mike.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.670
- Coming with me?
- We're going home.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.853
- Here's your dog.
- Oh, thank you.

34:25.415 --> 34:28.025
Mmm, hot dogs
are for closers.

34:28.659 --> 34:29.895
You still have
a ton of crap.

34:31.145 --> 34:32.446
- $1 for the comics.

34:33.134 --> 34:34.070
$1.

34:34.688 --> 34:35.391
Nothing?

34:35.722 --> 34:37.009
- You know what
the problem is, Ming?

34:37.157 --> 34:39.058
You have the stank
of desperation

34:39.069 --> 34:40.214
hanging all around you.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.500
- Hey, come here, please!
- Yeah, it's really sad.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.897
- I mean, honestly, doesn't this
whole place have that stank?

34:45.081 --> 34:46.272
- I know,
that's the killer.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.379
The whole place
reeks of desperation,

34:48.661 --> 34:50.156
yet, somehow,
you stand out.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.766
[Laughter]

34:52.456 --> 34:53.637
I'm gonna take
the chair, all right?

34:54.330 --> 34:55.733
- [Laughs]

34:59.346 --> 35:00.686
- Bye-bye,
douche bag!

35:04.488 --> 35:05.439
- Hey, I'm still open.

35:06.741 --> 35:07.781
Got great stuff here.

35:08.389 --> 35:09.613
"COMING UP".

35:09.653 --> 35:11.163
- I have
this Thor poster.

35:11.224 --> 35:12.773
- It's absolutely gorgeous.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.768
- I feel myself
getting nerdier by the minute.

35:14.961 --> 35:16.331
[Laughter]

35:20.055 --> 35:22.109
"LAST MAN STANDING".

35:26.459 --> 35:27.449
- How'd you guys do?

35:28.295 --> 35:29.266
- We did all right.

35:29.326 --> 35:31.277
- How much did you make?
- I made...

35:31.610 --> 35:32.293
$54.

35:32.382 --> 35:33.726
- Bry?
- I made 42.

35:34.506 --> 35:35.876
- All right, well,
where's Ming?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.208
- Great deals.
Great steals.

35:41.726 --> 35:42.790
I'm still open.

35:43.196 --> 35:44.472
[Sighs]

35:44.766 --> 35:46.328
Two-for-one!
Two-for-one!

35:46.549 --> 35:48.072
$1 for the comic.

35:48.945 --> 35:49.881
$1.

35:52.213 --> 35:53.752
- Ming,
you're still here, huh?

35:54.106 --> 35:55.618
- Still here.
Whole table, Rob.

35:55.916 --> 35:57.556
- How much?
- 25 for everything.

35:57.751 --> 35:58.741
- How about 20?

35:59.720 --> 36:00.625
- [Sighs]

36:00.899 --> 36:03.839
- The omnipresent Rob Bruce
was at the flea market as well.

36:03.839 --> 36:04.904
That doesn't surprise me.

36:05.025 --> 36:06.305
- Of course,
Rob Bruce was there.

36:06.768 --> 36:08.662
- It's New Jersey
and there are collectibles.

36:08.662 --> 36:09.741
Rob Bruce is there.

36:09.851 --> 36:13.089
- How about, uh, 22?
- Come on, Rob, 25.

36:13.273 --> 36:14.330
- $22.
- You know--you know--

36:14.581 --> 36:16.402
you know you can get
way more than this.

36:17.681 --> 36:18.330
- 22.

36:19.335 --> 36:20.719
- 23.
- 22.

36:21.604 --> 36:23.390
- Come on, you're not even
gonna give me 23?

36:23.970 --> 36:25.336
- 23.
- All right.

36:25.585 --> 36:27.561
Deal. $23.
And I even got a box for you.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.174
- Cool.

36:32.881 --> 36:34.244
"JAY AND SILENT BOB'S"

36:34.272 --> 36:35.074
"SECRET STASH".

36:35.146 --> 36:36.177
- Dude, you know what you
should do from now on?

36:36.177 --> 36:37.366
Whenever you
answer the phone,

36:37.366 --> 36:39.695
give it the Christian Bale
Batman voice.

36:39.772 --> 36:41.155
[Deep, raspy]
Comics.

36:41.648 --> 36:43.770
Why does he growl?
Did you ever figure that out?

36:43.770 --> 36:45.429
- It's because
he's trying to be intimidating.

36:45.707 --> 36:47.780
If you got a guy
dressed in a costume

36:48.179 --> 36:49.608
and he's growling
in your face,

36:50.003 --> 36:51.839
you're more apt
to listen to what he's saying.

36:52.135 --> 36:52.838
- Definitely.

36:53.043 --> 36:54.978
[Growling] Give me
a ham and Swiss on rye.

36:55.084 --> 36:56.897
- I might put a little bit
more ham on your sandwich

36:56.897 --> 36:58.065
if I was behind the counter.
- Really?

36:58.065 --> 37:00.105
- Yeah, "this guy's
a lunatic, I might want to

37:00.105 --> 37:01.729
make sure he's happy
with his sandwich."

37:02.152 --> 37:04.113
- Knowing that, man,
it doesn't have to stop there.

37:04.385 --> 37:05.208
- Try it with your girl.

37:06.165 --> 37:07.442
- Oh, that's a good idea!

37:07.805 --> 37:10.064
She's like,
"we can go to second base."

37:10.064 --> 37:11.849
And I was like,
"I was thinking third."

37:13.384 --> 37:14.448
And then
she'll just do it.

37:15.088 --> 37:16.225
It would hurt
your voice though.

37:16.524 --> 37:17.680
I can hardly talk.

37:17.977 --> 37:19.146
- That's why
you're not Batman.

37:19.733 --> 37:21.925
That's why you're hanging out
in a comic book store.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.037
[Bell rings]

37:24.881 --> 37:26.512
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- I'm all right, how's it going?

37:26.512 --> 37:28.089
- Good, my name's Walt.
- I'm Andrew.

37:28.284 --> 37:29.152
- [Growling]
Bryan.

37:29.281 --> 37:30.302
- Hey, Bryan.

37:30.391 --> 37:32.011
- You looking to sell today?
- Yeah, for sure.

37:32.215 --> 37:34.512
I have this--
this, uh, Thor poster.

37:34.633 --> 37:38.116
"RELEASED THROUGH MARVEL COMICS'

wib a whole series of these.

I've seen the Doctor Doom

37:49.106 --> 37:50.886
and the Silver Surfer
one before.

37:50.951 --> 37:52.780
This is the only time
that I've ever seen this.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.021
- That's how Kirby's work
should be presented.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.165
- It's just coming at you.
- In a poster-sized panel.

37:57.165 --> 37:58.948
I mean,
it's absolutely gorgeous.

37:59.116 --> 38:01.138
- I feel myself
getting nerdier by the minute.

38:01.434 --> 38:04.455
- Jack "The King" Kirby
was the artist that defined

38:04.455 --> 38:06.714
the look of a lot
of the characters that you know.

38:06.714 --> 38:09.034
The Fantastic Four,
Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk.

38:09.359 --> 38:10.906
Explain "Kirby Dots."

38:11.339 --> 38:14.029
- It's just black dots
portrayed on a page

38:14.029 --> 38:16.946
to convey energy, space.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.360
- It was just, like,
this weird touch that he would

38:19.360 --> 38:21.935
throw into things that
became kind of his signature,

38:21.990 --> 38:23.746
and not just in his work,
but in comics

38:23.746 --> 38:24.708
kind of in general.

38:25.039 --> 38:27.157
Like, he put a stamp
on storytelling.

38:27.562 --> 38:29.418
Visual storytelling
has been with us

38:29.418 --> 38:30.981
longer than we've had words.

38:30.981 --> 38:33.147
They can go back
and find cave drawings.

38:33.303 --> 38:34.573
"Here's a big buffalo.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.484
We all attacked it
with many arrows."

38:36.484 --> 38:37.493
And stuff like that.

38:37.519 --> 38:38.328
- It'd be interesting
to find

38:38.328 --> 38:40.205
a cave drawing with some
Kirby dots around it.

38:40.389 --> 38:41.249
- Oh, my g--right?

38:41.249 --> 38:42.857
- Could you imagine?
- "He's a fraud!"

38:43.196 --> 38:45.318
- "Yet another white man stole
from the native Americans!"

38:45.561 --> 38:46.639
- Like most do.

38:47.013 --> 38:48.169
- All right,
is that it today?

38:48.266 --> 38:50.561
<i>- No, I have
tomb of Dracula #10,</i>

38:50.561 --> 38:52.524
which is the first
appearance of blade,

38:52.524 --> 38:54.549
from the Wesley Snipes movies.

38:54.587 --> 38:56.235
"THE TOMB OF DRACULA #10.
BY MARVEL. JULY, 1972."

38:56.275 --> 38:58.117
"PUBLISHED AFTER THE COMICS CODE EASED ITS

38:58.118 --> 38:59.915
RESTRICTION ON VAMPIRE STORES IN 1971".

39:00.298 --> 39:01.255
- I mean, Wesley snipes,

39:01.255 --> 39:03.289
I thought he played
a perfect blade.

39:03.452 --> 39:04.648
- They should've
given him a pass

39:04.714 --> 39:06.036
with the tax stuff for it.
[Laughter]

39:07.814 --> 39:09.160
- So how come
you're moving this?

39:09.366 --> 39:11.680
- I recently purchased
a house and, you know,

39:11.680 --> 39:13.515
trying to make some repairs
and this and that.

39:13.515 --> 39:15.893
So I'm hoping that
whatever I can get from--

39:15.893 --> 39:17.887
from this stuff
can be added to the fund.

39:18.092 --> 39:19.869
- Okay, so how much
you want for the poster?

39:20.060 --> 39:22.121
- I'm looking for
125 for it.

39:22.489 --> 39:23.906
- Buck and a quarter, huh?
- Yep.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.968
- Now's the moment, dude.
The voice.

39:28.968 --> 39:30.424
- What's that?
- Use the voice on him.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.846
- [Growling] I don't know
if I can go that high.

39:35.712 --> 39:36.307
- Okay.

39:36.430 --> 39:37.989
- [Laughs]
- It's working!

39:39.979 --> 39:42.674
<i>- Um, if I were to take
the tomb of Dracula</i>

39:42.674 --> 39:44.012
and the Thor poster today,

39:44.012 --> 39:45.617
what could you do me
for those two?

39:46.152 --> 39:48.687
- I'd say...$400?

39:48.805 --> 39:50.922
- So you think
this is worth $300?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.612
- Um, it's also
signed by Gene Colan,

39:52.612 --> 39:54.630
who was the cover artist
and the artist who did

39:54.630 --> 39:55.812
- the inside of the book.
- Yeah.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.166
- The fact that it's signed
doesn't do anything,

39:58.166 --> 39:59.188
you feel, to the value?

40:00.858 --> 40:02.133
It's not authenticated.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.562
When I sell it to
somebody in the store,

40:04.562 --> 40:05.824
I'm gonna have to
go in there saying,

40:05.824 --> 40:07.254
- "look, it's signed..."
- Sure.

40:07.254 --> 40:08.417
- "I think it's by Gene Colan."

40:08.714 --> 40:09.706
- [Growling]
Yes, it is.

40:10.789 --> 40:11.804
And then
they'll believe it.

40:12.336 --> 40:13.489
- There's no way
to really tell

40:13.489 --> 40:14.828
if that's
a real-deal signature.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.217
- I don't want to put
your reputation on the line

40:17.217 --> 40:18.627
or the stash's reputation
on the line

40:18.627 --> 40:21.341
of selling
bogus signatured items.

40:21.508 --> 40:23.654
- Do people get tight
if you're like, "I'm sorry, man,

40:23.654 --> 40:26.790
like, the autograph doesn't help
in my case, it kinda hurts."

40:26.790 --> 40:28.451
Do they get, like,
"hey, what are you, crazy?"

40:28.500 --> 40:30.236
- Yeah, they almost get like
"what are you insinuating?

40:30.236 --> 40:34.822
I'm some sort of, uh, crook
or I'm a...Shim-Sham man?"

40:34.953 --> 40:35.835
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:35.835 --> 40:37.233
- Nobody wants to be
a shim-sham man.

40:39.295 --> 40:41.757
<i>- How about 160 for
the tomb of Dracula,</i>

40:41.939 --> 40:44.712
first appearance of blade,
and the Kirby Thor poster?

40:44.968 --> 40:47.551
- 160.
- Cash, right now, done.

40:53.086 --> 40:55.445
<i>- I think I'm gonna hold on
to tomb of Dracula</i>

40:55.445 --> 40:58.230
and for sure 100 bucks for
the Thor poster, it's yours.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.492
- Um, okay,
I wanted both though.

41:05.587 --> 41:07.870
- Um...175 for both.

41:11.053 --> 41:12.879
- 160. Done.

41:18.336 --> 41:19.710
- I can't--I just--
- okay.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.824
- I don't think I'm ready
to sell this yet.

41:21.824 --> 41:22.532
- Okay.

41:22.835 --> 41:23.846
- How about the poster?

41:24.427 --> 41:25.962
- $75 for the poster.

41:27.628 --> 41:29.057
- All right, $75 it is.

41:29.586 --> 41:31.128
- Got yourself a deal.
- All right.

41:32.388 --> 41:32.961
- Let me ask you something.

41:32.961 --> 41:34.793
Do people ever come in here
to buy anything?

41:35.677 --> 41:36.765
- Feels like no.

41:38.312 --> 41:39.290
Thank you.
- All right.

41:39.446 --> 41:39.952
- Take it easy.

41:39.952 --> 41:41.454
- For sure, man.
- All right.

41:43.324 --> 41:44.253
- That is awesome.

41:45.016 --> 41:46.587
"THE RETURN OF THE MING".

41:52.510 --> 41:54.353
- Hot dogs are for closers.
Right, douche bags?

41:55.814 --> 42:00.206
- Bottom line, Mike made 54,
Brian made 42.

42:00.676 --> 42:02.462
What did Ming bring in
today?

42:02.652 --> 42:04.128
- All right,
let's count it up here.

42:04.329 --> 42:05.142
20.

42:05.207 --> 42:09.358
- 40, 50, 60, $75.

42:09.721 --> 42:11.087
- Wow, he put you to shame.

42:11.087 --> 42:14.116
- Well, he made an extra $2
by staying an extra five hours.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.298
[All laughing]

42:15.298 --> 42:16.971
So if that's winning, okay.

42:17.191 --> 42:19.804
- I think it's time
to just give the man...

42:20.400 --> 42:21.352
His just due.

42:21.533 --> 42:22.604
- You did well, Ming.

42:23.633 --> 42:25.449
You showed up early,
you stayed late.

42:26.939 --> 42:29.773
Plus, you get to stick a fat,
shiny hot dog in your mouth.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.379
Go on, take another bite
of your victory weiner, Ming.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.469
- Don't let him
take it away.

42:35.166 --> 42:37.153
You earned every bite,
every inch

42:37.213 --> 42:38.807
that goes down your throat.

42:41.021 --> 42:44.197
<i>- I guess that's gonna do it
for this week on Comic Book Men.</i>

42:44.247 --> 42:46.203
- I'm Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

42:46.402 --> 42:47.752
- Walt Flanagan.
- Ming Chen.

42:47.895 --> 42:49.166
- And Michael Zapcic.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.541
- Don't stop believing.
