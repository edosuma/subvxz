WEBVTT

00:10.570 --> 00:11.760
Doctor's comin'!

00:17.400 --> 00:18.300
What the...?

00:19.640 --> 00:22.010
Frank, you idiot. Your bed's down the hall!

00:22.045 --> 00:24.190
I know! I love you...

00:24.930 --> 00:26.030
Ohh!

00:27.480 --> 00:30.630
You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?

00:30.870 --> 00:32.840
Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there?

00:32.880 --> 00:36.250
She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.

00:37.460 --> 00:38.960
Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!

00:39.470 --> 00:43.570
You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.907
But now that you slept with my brother, we're even.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.409
So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!

00:49.866 --> 00:51.235
- J.D...
- So's your face.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.765
That doesn't even make any sense.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.170
"So's your face" always makes sense.

00:54.205 --> 00:55.245
J.D., that's stupid.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.140
So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!

00:59.810 --> 01:03.235
Perry, are you familiar with Sacred Heart's community service program?

01:03.270 --> 01:06.625
Bobby, lately I've noticed you don't listen to a single word people say,

01:06.660 --> 01:10.140
so my reply to your question is I think you're the world's biggest jackass...

01:10.175 --> 01:11.300
and I look forward to your death.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.210
Well, you must not be familiar with it because you're the only staff member...

01:14.245 --> 01:17.500
not to have completed his 24-hour mandatory community service.

01:17.610 --> 01:21.160
Consider yourself suspended until you do! Oh, and I'm never dying.

01:22.270 --> 01:23.640
Oh, guh!

01:25.490 --> 01:26.530
Crab claw.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.050
Did you just pinch my arm fat?

01:30.210 --> 01:31.310
Yeah, does it make you mad?

01:32.020 --> 01:33.110
I don't know, it was kind of a...

01:33.145 --> 01:34.010
Crab claw!

01:34.210 --> 01:35.160
What are you doing!?

01:35.400 --> 01:38.600
I'm moving to Milwaukee for a psychiatric fellowship, and by pinching your arm I'm making you angry...

01:38.635 --> 01:40.680
instead of feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I'm leaving.

01:41.740 --> 01:42.930
You're leaving?

01:43.500 --> 01:45.080
Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.040
They're here! Ignite the tractor beam!

01:49.290 --> 01:51.070
I should go, that's my 2 o'clock.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.580
I can't believe she's leaving!

01:55.790 --> 01:58.030
Hospital just lost its second-hottest employee.

01:58.260 --> 02:01.580
Don't think you can drool all over her just because you rank me number one.

02:01.615 --> 02:02.940
Baby, Nurse Tisdale's number one.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.610
You g.. you gotta be single to be on the list.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.110
You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?

02:10.300 --> 02:11.630
Calm down, Twelve.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.680
Yes, top twenty!

02:13.990 --> 02:17.410
Look, you guys, we should really do something for Molly, like throw her a party.

02:17.860 --> 02:20.240
I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.

02:21.560 --> 02:25.360
Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.900
Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.

02:31.390 --> 02:33.460
This is amazing, Elliot, thank you.

02:33.610 --> 02:37.360
I also had a piñata made to look exactly like you, but I don't know what happened to it.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.220
Whoa, it's gettin' late.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.080
Big Dog wants some candy.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.860
Yes, baby, Molly is attractive.

02:50.110 --> 02:53.230
But she doesn't hold a candle to my Puerto Rican princess!

02:53.890 --> 02:56.770
For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican.

02:59.770 --> 03:03.065
My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.005
I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.395
See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers...

03:07.430 --> 03:10.470
is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.040
Wow, look, flaming shots!

03:14.330 --> 03:17.690
...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.

03:17.870 --> 03:19.110
Will you excuse me a moment?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.495
PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!

03:22.530 --> 03:24.530
All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!

03:26.590 --> 03:28.210
DOUG! WHY!?

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074

03:37.580 --> 03:39.970
The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken!

03:40.020 --> 03:42.520
Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

03:45.620 --> 03:48.970
So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!

03:53.330 --> 03:57.160
After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.

03:57.950 --> 04:01.470
Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?

04:02.280 --> 04:03.970
Eventually things wound down.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.500
Some people went home...

04:07.580 --> 04:08.740
Some just went to bed...

04:08.775 --> 04:09.510
'Night.

04:11.390 --> 04:14.270
And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch,

04:14.305 --> 04:17.149
watching that unbelievably romantic scene from'16 Candles'.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.769
The Donger need food!

04:20.100 --> 04:21.769
No, not that one! This one.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.410
Happy birthday, Samantha.

04:31.270 --> 04:34.210
God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.240
Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!

04:52.920 --> 04:57.950
Dude, now that I have adjusted your fuel valve, your scooter is going to fly!

04:57.980 --> 05:00.470
Speaking of things that are fly, I made out with Molly last night.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.810
I know that was kind of a lame segue, but I've been with you all morning...

05:02.845 --> 05:04.600
and you've yet to use the words "make" or "out. "

05:05.800 --> 05:07.030
I hope it doesn't bother you.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.370
Nah. How was it?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.400
Weird. His tongue was freezing.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.100
I gave her the ol' ice tongue.

05:13.260 --> 05:15.910
It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.880
He kept running to the kitchen to put ice on his tongue.

05:18.290 --> 05:22.410
I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.

05:22.445 --> 05:24.295
I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.

05:24.330 --> 05:27.300
Dude, just because it's good on salad doesn't mean it's good on your lips.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.860
I wuv your wittle outfit.

05:32.895 --> 05:33.810
Now listen, you.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.260
Riding in an ambulance takes care of my community service,

05:36.295 --> 05:38.210
so I'm doing two shifts back to back... I'm gonna...

05:38.290 --> 05:41.640
...knock this whole thing out in a single day. Besides, how bad can it be?

05:42.590 --> 05:44.755
Howdy, partner! Name's Denise Lemon.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.755
Looks like we got ourselves a little ambu-date...

05:46.790 --> 05:49.490
that's "ambulance" and "date" put together. I got a million of those!

05:51.620 --> 05:53.350
I am loving this!

05:54.070 --> 05:55.585
Hey, uh, hon, before you hop in there,

05:55.620 --> 05:57.810
could you do me a little favoroony and check the windshield wiper?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.880
I think I got something caught up there. Yeah.

06:00.230 --> 06:01.480
No problem. I got it.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.260
I always get the newbies with that one!

06:07.920 --> 06:09.900
Got you! You know it!

06:10.680 --> 06:13.870
When they strap me in the chair, please let them know the murder was just.

06:16.570 --> 06:20.250
Hey, Elliot, I was making out some prescription orders... and speaking of making out...

06:20.285 --> 06:21.460
She already told me, J.D.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.960
Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out.

06:24.060 --> 06:27.580
Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!

06:28.390 --> 06:32.140
Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.440
So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator... mama needs a pedicure! Heh.

06:35.700 --> 06:40.080
Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.830
Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.

06:43.450 --> 06:48.010
Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again,

06:48.045 --> 06:50.440
there's really not a whole lot I "need" from you, okay?

06:50.940 --> 06:52.380
So g'head and give it your best shot.

06:53.950 --> 06:55.590
Andele, Juan!

06:57.480 --> 07:00.960
Doctor, doctor, gimme the news I got a...

07:01.110 --> 07:03.475
Yeah, I'm not a big car-singing kind of guy.

07:03.510 --> 07:08.380
Aww, "Bad case of loving you," Perr! Come on, where's the fun?

07:09.100 --> 07:10.935
You know, you don't get this kind of rush on a normal job.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.540
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't. You know what I'm saying?

07:13.550 --> 07:14.670
You're saying you don't.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.080
Well, Perr, sometimes you do.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.900
Are you looking at my boy, Davey? He's ten there; he'll always be that age to me.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.785
Can't take my eyes off of him.

07:22.820 --> 07:25.450
I don't blame you, he's gorgeous! He looks just like his mama!

07:25.890 --> 07:26.760
I'm kidding!

07:28.330 --> 07:30.120
I wish we had more time together, I do.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.160
Boy, you wouldn't believe when we started school?

07:32.270 --> 07:35.010
First day he cried, second day I cried, third day we both cried...

07:35.110 --> 07:37.010
not'cause of school,'cause we had a go-cart accident.

07:37.650 --> 07:39.420
Think it's how my nose got bent...

07:39.960 --> 07:40.860
Who knows?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.370
Nose knows. I love words. Don't you love words?

07:44.570 --> 07:45.837
I like "strangle. "

07:49.360 --> 07:51.479
There she is! Thanks, Juan!

07:51.666 --> 07:54.595
Hey, Molly. It's your last night, you wanna grab a beer or something?

07:54.650 --> 07:55.955
J.D., I have to tell you something.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.550
Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?

07:57.610 --> 07:58.930
No one can die from beer.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.870
Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.

08:02.050 --> 08:03.630
Comin' at you, Shinski!

08:10.540 --> 08:14.290
People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.390
J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.

08:22.180 --> 08:23.050
You were saying?

08:23.760 --> 08:24.920
Dude, what the hell!?

08:27.150 --> 08:29.030
Oh, that's what's up. Go about your business!

08:29.770 --> 08:34.120
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.

08:35.150 --> 08:40.110
Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.799
My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex...

08:43.835 --> 08:47.150
in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer. "

08:47.380 --> 08:49.845
I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets,

08:49.880 --> 08:53.640
and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.

08:54.580 --> 08:57.040
At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.

08:57.260 --> 09:01.460
Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure.

09:01.610 --> 09:04.195
And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships...

09:04.230 --> 09:09.960
is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.

09:10.310 --> 09:11.020
Wow.

09:14.660 --> 09:17.540
Boy, I tell you what, there, Jordan, I'm sure glad that shift is...

09:17.590 --> 09:21.410
Perry! I was just telling Jordan here about that sneezing attack that I had this morning.

09:21.445 --> 09:23.410
Was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?

09:23.780 --> 09:26.430
Yes, Perry, was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.150
What are you doing here, Denise?

09:28.660 --> 09:30.925
Well, I heard that you were doing back to back shifts,

09:30.960 --> 09:34.260
so I pulled a couple of strings so that we could get the old band back together!

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
Perry! You've always wanted to be in a band!

09:36.500 --> 09:38.660
Get out of town! I just came up with that band thing!

09:38.695 --> 09:40.070
Get out of town, Perry!

09:41.400 --> 09:45.830
Well, laissez le bon temps rouler. Translation: Let the good times roll.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.730
See, that's what they say in New Orleans, The Big Easy.

09:47.790 --> 09:49.730
You know, that was my nickname in high school... New Orleans.

09:49.770 --> 09:52.290
No, I'm just kidding, it was The Big Easy. I was a huge slut!

09:52.740 --> 09:54.230
I was, I did everybody.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.490
Much better without the icy tongue.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.100
I'll remember that.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.440
Why would she lie?

10:05.170 --> 10:06.280
Should we get out of here?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.590
D'you think you can handle it?

10:07.640 --> 10:09.440
No. But you won't know until after.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.690
You just need to clear it with one person first.

10:11.950 --> 10:12.890
Just tell me who!

10:17.990 --> 10:18.800
N o.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.150
Oh, what's the matter, J.D., freezer got your tongue?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.430
That doesn't even make any sense!

10:24.465 --> 10:25.490
So's your face!

10:25.840 --> 10:27.690
Dammit! Walked into that one!

10:33.390 --> 10:35.150
The key here is to not seem desperate.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.430
Please, Elliot! Please let me have sex! She's leaving tomorrow!

10:38.710 --> 10:41.860
It's simple, J.D., I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.770
I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.000
Fine, we're not even.

10:56.050 --> 10:56.660
Thank you.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.490
But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!

10:58.860 --> 11:02.290
I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.770
J.D. may fornicate with anyone.

11:14.430 --> 11:17.680
Okay, Sasha, let's see what your new engine can do!

11:22.640 --> 11:25.580
So, little Jack's a baseball fan, eh?

11:25.820 --> 11:27.295
He's two and he can't talk yet.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.480
You know what you should do? You should get him some baseball cards!

11:29.610 --> 11:33.370
I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.030
Never liked the gum, though.

11:35.810 --> 11:37.750
Gum's a weird word, isn't it? You know?

11:37.830 --> 11:40.490
Do you ever notice some words, you say'em enough, they don't even sound like words anymore?

11:40.525 --> 11:47.260
Gum... Gum. Gum. Gum! Gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gummmm. Gum gum gum...

11:47.295 --> 11:50.060
Oh, happy day. She's blown a fuse.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.160
I swear to God, Jordan, I can't do it again.

11:54.340 --> 11:58.870
Perry, it's just one more shift. Just tune her out and she'll eventually leave you alone.

11:59.430 --> 12:00.515
Consider it done.

12:00.550 --> 12:02.320
...gum gum gum gum gum. Gum.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.920
Relax! At most, you have a minor concussion.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.530
Now I just wanna check your pupils, okay?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.575
Doug, that's for...

12:15.610 --> 12:16.650
- ... ears.
- Ears!

12:16.760 --> 12:18.870
Right! I'm not stupid!

12:19.260 --> 12:20.490
Where are my clothes?

12:20.530 --> 12:21.960
I sent them to the dry cleaners!

12:22.500 --> 12:23.280
Doug!

12:31.190 --> 12:32.830
You responsible for this head blood?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.440
Look, here's the bottom line:

12:34.890 --> 12:37.930
I am currently in possession of a note that would give me permission to have sex...

12:37.965 --> 12:40.760
with a very beautiful woman, but I have no way of getting to her apartment.

12:41.930 --> 12:43.120
Then what are we waiting for.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.750
Get in.

12:46.070 --> 12:48.070
Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

13:00.480 --> 13:01.550
What are you doing!?

13:01.730 --> 13:03.900
It's been four years.

13:04.530 --> 13:06.930
How do you not get how this works?

13:17.160 --> 13:17.900
Hello?

13:18.060 --> 13:18.950
Turk, it's me!

13:19.230 --> 13:22.820
Hang on, I'm doing my diabetes test. Ninety eight, is that a good number?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.265
Yes! It's good! You surgeons are idiots!

13:25.300 --> 13:27.780
Oh, I'm the idiot, huh? Well, guess what you were wrong about!

13:28.600 --> 13:29.860
Carla's Dominican!

13:31.340 --> 13:35.375
All right, come on up, Perr! Let's get this show on the road!

13:35.410 --> 13:40.140
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and hang out back here, just kinda get acclimated with this area.

13:40.740 --> 13:41.660
Oh, okay.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.255
Hey, funny tidbit...

13:44.290 --> 13:47.340
Sorry there, D., can't really hear you back here.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.020
Ohh. Message received!

13:52.450 --> 13:54.100
Hey, can you hear me now?

13:54.790 --> 13:56.950
Hey, it's like that commercial. "Can you hear me now?"

13:57.120 --> 14:02.020
See, now, the only downside is that I can't hear you, so I guess I'll just have to talk for both of us.

14:02.290 --> 14:08.370
So back to that tidbit. Now, that's a funny word. See, I know what a bit is, but what's a tid?

14:08.720 --> 14:14.620
Tid... Tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid. Tid. Tid. Tid. Tid.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.190
J.D.! We're over here!

14:18.380 --> 14:19.370
COMING!

14:20.230 --> 14:22.700
I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just sex.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.980
It's not just sex.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.590
It's sex with Molly!

14:26.040 --> 14:29.170
Any guy would kill to have sex with Molly. Hell, I'd kill to have sex with Molly!

14:30.000 --> 14:30.750
That's it.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.520
Sorry, dude.

14:41.820 --> 14:42.770
Where were you?

14:42.830 --> 14:44.310
I was treed by that coyote!

14:45.650 --> 14:46.750
You got your phone?

14:47.340 --> 14:48.250
He took it.

14:50.200 --> 14:50.940
What now?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.775
I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!

14:55.810 --> 14:58.430
I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.365
Yeah, this is much better!

15:02.400 --> 15:03.975
I agree, but my legs are cramping!

15:04.010 --> 15:06.230
You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!

15:06.265 --> 15:07.450
I was kneeling on a nest!

15:07.560 --> 15:09.090
Just think of Molly, man!

15:10.830 --> 15:12.830
J.D., where are you?

15:13.220 --> 15:16.000
J.D.! Hurry!

15:19.190 --> 15:21.060
Now that's what I'm talkin' about!

15:29.890 --> 15:30.710
It's okay.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.710
Hey, Perr. I just saw an adorable interracial gay couple.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.350
Aw, just precious.

15:39.570 --> 15:43.430
Lookit, enough of the squawk-box, all right? And just keep your eye on the road, whatta you say?

15:45.100 --> 15:47.540
All right, no more squawk-box.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.640
But, Perr, don't sweat the roads. I know'em like the back of my hand.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.530
Ohh, Perr... I think I'm hurt.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.620
I'm not badly hurt, just a tidbit.

16:08.150 --> 16:11.370
Elliot, you gotta help me! We're in front of Molly's apartment, but her name isn't listed anymore.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.330
It's either... 4G or 5G.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.430
J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning.

16:17.690 --> 16:20.170
Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.

16:20.205 --> 16:22.300
That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.715
Hi, is Molly here?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.800
It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?

16:31.650 --> 16:33.510
Dorian. Turkleton.

16:35.410 --> 16:37.230
If you come in, you have to take your shoes off.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.770
Sorry, wrong apartment.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.600
Konichiwa.

16:44.010 --> 16:47.400
Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!

16:47.830 --> 16:51.950
Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.

16:53.010 --> 16:54.530
Or is it the greatest moment of your life?

16:56.190 --> 16:58.430
You're right. Gimme that gown!

17:00.210 --> 17:01.670
Go get her, buddy!

17:04.420 --> 17:05.800
Hey, this isn't that scary.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.020
Molly!?

17:17.460 --> 17:18.369
Hey!

17:20.069 --> 17:25.290
Sorry about your collarbone. Say! I've got a community service form here, would you sign it for me?

17:25.325 --> 17:26.619
Sure thing, Perr.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.580
So, you gonna come by and visit me later?

17:29.820 --> 17:32.890
Denise, that's not very likely. And here's why:

17:33.170 --> 17:37.320
All you do is talk, talk, talk talk, talk, talk, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk.

17:37.355 --> 17:41.450
And when you're not talking, I'm betting you're thinking about talking. I mean,

17:41.485 --> 17:43.270
can I ask you a personal question?

17:43.810 --> 17:47.810
Have you ever had a thought that you didn't immediately verbalize?

17:49.570 --> 17:51.270
Well, I don't know. That's a tough one, Perr.

17:52.570 --> 17:55.500
Oh, look, the window's open again! You can see the moon!

17:55.730 --> 17:56.600
Oh my God.

17:57.180 --> 18:01.190
What happened in your life that made you so needy that you've got to fill...

18:01.225 --> 18:03.670
every waking second by babbling on?

18:04.010 --> 18:06.450
Fine, don't visit. My son will come.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.000
And now we are right back on your son again.

18:09.300 --> 18:13.510
I'll be honest with you, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get your voice out of my head.

18:13.730 --> 18:16.010
It is a very real concern.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.710
Hey, did you leave anything in the ambulance?

18:21.745 --> 18:23.240
Only my will to live, why?

18:23.340 --> 18:24.950
Then I guess this is your partner's.

18:26.910 --> 18:31.160
See, now, I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes...

18:32.310 --> 18:34.480
He's ten there. He'll always be that age to me...

18:35.350 --> 18:36.880
I wish I had more time with him, though.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.350
What happened to your son, Denise?

18:55.180 --> 18:56.900
He died in an accident.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.000
Paramedics were amazing, though.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.450
That's actually the reason I became one.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.450
I really miss him, you know?

19:24.010 --> 19:25.130
Thanks a lot.

19:26.610 --> 19:31.150
Molly, I think you should stay. I'm off today, we'll have an amazing time, you can leave tomorrow.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.940
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.150
Well, maybe this'll change your mind.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.310
How's it going?

19:42.960 --> 19:44.940
Pretty well. Nice landing.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.710
Thanks.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.460
J.D., I think this note's for you.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.670
I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.180
Take care.

20:09.800 --> 20:15.190
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

20:16.680 --> 20:20.010
Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.560
Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters,

20:27.370 --> 20:28.550
you have to answer the call.

20:28.690 --> 20:31.720
Ooh, he's just such a cutie pie! Look at that!

20:32.220 --> 20:33.785
Have you ever had cutie pie, Perry?

20:33.820 --> 20:35.480
- No,'course not.
- I like it à la mode.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.230
I'm kidding! I know it's not really pie!

20:37.780 --> 20:43.070
But I'll tell you, if it was really pie I would eat it up, I'd gobble it, because I love pie!

20:43.105 --> 20:45.300
Oh my God! You're my favorite!
