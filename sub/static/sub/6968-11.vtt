00:36.662 --> 00:38.705
Hall trying to stay away from him.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.625
Come on, man. Come on.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.628
Come on, now. Put him down.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.713
Put him down!

00:47.798 --> 00:49.842
- Oh!
- Hey, man. Watch it!

00:49.967 --> 00:53.011
- Come on, Upshaw! Let's go!
- You're a moron, Tiernan.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.932
You're both morons.
And who's watching the floor?

00:57.307 --> 01:01.228
- Whatshisname, the skink.
- Guess who died this afternoon.

01:01.728 --> 01:05.022
- Mrs Richardson.
- Face plant in a bowl of puddin'.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.821
- I don't suppose you changed her room.
- Oh, no. We left that for you.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.747
Oh!

01:20.831 --> 01:23.417
Now Hall's against the ropes!

01:26.962 --> 01:29.006
OK. Party's over, gents.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.344
Why'd you do that?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.555
- Cos rules are rules, Stan.
- Ach!

01:37.848 --> 01:40.142
And I'm the queen bitch around here.

01:40.267 --> 01:44.354
- Gung said we can watch the fight.
- Yeah? Do I look like Gung to you?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.565
No. You got a better figure.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.985
You wanna keep that hand, Hal,
you better let go.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.279
How about a little sponge bath?

01:52.321 --> 01:55.991
How about I take care of
these wanderin' hands of yours?

01:57.159 --> 01:59.161
Come here.

02:02.581 --> 02:07.794
- You like strappin' me down, don't you?
- Oh, yeah. I really get off on it.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.977
Hey, Gung. No TV after nine o'clock.
Do you understand?

02:25.395 --> 02:28.649
- Dr Grago said they're getting better...
- Oh, right!

02:28.774 --> 02:33.612
That's because they don't pinch his butt
every time he walks into the room.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.671
Argh!

03:39.428 --> 03:41.471
Oh!

03:45.851 --> 03:47.686
No!

03:47.853 --> 03:50.022
Somebody help me!

03:50.147 --> 03:53.483
Somebody, please! Please!

03:54.443 --> 03:58.572
Help me! Please, help me! Please!

<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 11 - Excelsis Dei

04:54.670 --> 04:56.755
Good morning.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.925
Whatever tape you found in that VCR,
it isn't mine.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.971
Good, because I put it back
with all those others that aren't yours.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.227
Well, this definitely isn't mine.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.813
No. This is Michelle Charters.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.567
She's a nurse at a convalescent home
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

05:16.650 --> 05:21.363
- What happened to her?
- According to Miss Charters, she was raped.

05:21.947 --> 05:27.369
The abrasions would be consistent with
her claims, as would be the medical report...

05:27.452 --> 05:31.498
...which cites the kind of injury
associated with sexual trauma.

05:31.582 --> 05:36.211
- Where'd you get this? Violent Crimes?
- No, the woman made the video herself.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.505
No one will believe her story.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.466
Why not?

05:41.550 --> 05:47.181
Because she claims to have been raped
by an invisible entity, a spirit being.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.892
I have <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> that document similar cases.

05:49.975 --> 05:55.522
- I know. I've been going through them.
- None of them have ever been substantiated.

05:55.606 --> 05:59.234
- Not surprisingly.
- Given the emotional violence of rape...

05:59.359 --> 06:02.654
...the face of the attacker
is often erased from memory.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.825
That he could be perceived as invisible
is a logical leap from there.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.453
- Yes, but this case is different.
- Why?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.331
She has filed a lawsuit
against the government.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.501
She seems to be certain
who the spirit being is.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.461
Mr Arden.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.255
- Hal Arden.
- And you know him...?

06:20.339 --> 06:23.675
He's been a patient where I work
for about five years.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.930
The facts of your case seem to contravene
those of other cases we have.

06:28.013 --> 06:32.559
Right. You mean, the other
"woman raped by invisible man" cases?

06:32.643 --> 06:35.270
How do you know it was him
who attacked you?

06:35.354 --> 06:37.439
He made advances toward me.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.651
And he said things, rude things.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.988
When you bathe somebody every day...

06:45.113 --> 06:48.742
...you get to know more about them
than you really need to.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.622
An old man smells a certain way...

06:53.705 --> 06:55.791
...and he feels a certain way.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.214
- I know this is hard for you.
- No, this is the easy part.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.592
"Hard" is not getting leave
or workman's comp...

07:05.676 --> 07:08.762
...and having to go back
to work with this... guy.

07:10.222 --> 07:15.018
To continue our investigation, we're
gonna need some evidence, physical or...

07:15.102 --> 07:17.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I've heard it.

07:17.771 --> 07:23.151
Unless you have hair or semen or fibres
or whatever, you guys can't build a case.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.320
That's right.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.157
Look, I didn't make this up, OK?

07:30.033 --> 07:32.077
I was attacked.

07:33.328 --> 07:37.916
And I'm not a shrinking violet who would
repress the memory of a rapist's face.

07:38.041 --> 07:43.338
If I could positively ID him or give you
something to incriminate the man, I would.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.887
You gotta be kidding me!

07:52.181 --> 07:54.725
What do I think about her claims? Huh!

07:54.808 --> 07:57.352
I should be in the Guinness Record Book.

07:58.687 --> 08:02.816
I'm 74 years old. I've got plumbing
older than this building.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.111
Hm?

08:08.614 --> 08:11.366
And it don't work much better either.

08:12.409 --> 08:17.581
Thank you for sharing. Are you aware you're
named in a lawsuit against the government?

08:17.664 --> 08:21.210
- I am?
- Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

08:21.627 --> 08:25.297
- What?
- Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

08:25.380 --> 08:28.884
Threaten? It was harmless,
for cryin' out loud.

08:29.009 --> 08:34.847
Ever since this sex-harassment fad,
men can't say what's on their minds.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.061
- She says you made advances.
- Hm?

08:39.770 --> 08:41.480
Advances?

08:41.563 --> 08:47.194
If I told you you were a pretty woman and
I would like to show you some affection...

08:47.319 --> 08:49.780
...would you be offended?

08:52.407 --> 08:54.826
Oh, I didn't mean to step on your toes there.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.289
Sir, there seems to be some confusion here.

08:59.373 --> 09:03.877
Yeah. I thought nurse whatshername
said she was rogered by a ghost.

09:05.379 --> 09:12.052
I may have one foot in the grave, but
I can't fly down hallways spreading amore.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.847
Apparently not.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.350
If... that's what it's like...

09:18.433 --> 09:20.978
If that's what it's like in heaven...

09:21.061 --> 09:23.105
...Lord, take me now!

09:25.315 --> 09:28.235
- What do you think, Mulder?
- About his plumbing?

09:28.360 --> 09:31.947
- About his story.
- I think this is gonna be a waste of time...

09:32.030 --> 09:34.908
...like all the other <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> on entity rape.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.327
Unsubstantiated phenomena.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.454
But in a substantiated crime.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.880
Hey, pay attention or you'll take
another bath with your clothes on.

09:48.672 --> 09:53.135
At five and a half bucks an hour,
I don't give a rat's ass either way.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.850
Ten years ago, Excelsis was
a leading facility in care of the elderly.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.769
Then funding was cut.
We were all but shut down.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.899
- Only a few wings are operational now.
- Is there a medical staff?

10:06.982 --> 10:10.194
Not on site.
Dr Grago visits three times a week.

10:10.277 --> 10:16.158
Residents are very well looked after, though.
We have a high standard of health treatment.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.411
- What kind of treatment?
- We specialise in the care...

10:19.494 --> 10:23.123
...of the degenerative diseases:
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.877
- We met with a patient today.
- We prefer "resident", actually.

10:26.960 --> 10:32.382
We met a resident who has Alzheimer's,
but he actually seemed quite spry and alert.

10:32.883 --> 10:37.638
You're speaking of Hal Arden, the man
accused of assaulting Michelle Charters.

10:37.721 --> 10:42.017
- Was he receiving special treatment?
- You'd have to speak to Dr Grago.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.355
Hal has been here almost eight years now.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.690
We're all quite fond of him.

10:48.774 --> 10:53.070
We were extremely dismayed
over this whole business with the lawsuit.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.366
Are you saying you don't believe
Nurse Charters' allegations of rape?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.785
There's something I'd like to show you.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.752
- What did you tell 'em?
- I didn't tell 'em anything.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.717
- Why are they still here?
- I don't know, Stan.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.805
- Now, you gotta be more careful.
- I am careful.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.516
You're gonna ruin it for all of us.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.269
If they find out, it all goes for nothin'.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.896
I didn't tell 'em anything.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.441
I'm not going to die in this godforsaken hole!
Do you hear me?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.569
Oh, back off, Stan.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.160
Where did you get that?

11:43.161 --> 11:45.747
I know where he keeps 'em.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.042
Give me one, Stan. Huh?

11:49.710 --> 11:52.087
I want another one, too.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.256
You can't handle another one.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.760
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll just
rat you out, then, huh?

11:58.886 --> 12:00.929
How would you like that?

12:06.643 --> 12:11.273
- This is Michelle Charters'?
- There are three separate insurance claims...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.442
...for accidents on the job.

12:13.525 --> 12:20.073
In April, she requested leave with full pay
due to job-related emotional stress.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.369
The request was summarily rejected.
There's more.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.997
- I'd like to review it myself.
- Certainly.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.210
Mrs Dawson, did you see Michelle
after the incident and her injuries?

12:31.335 --> 12:34.713
I wasn't here that night,
but I did see her the following day.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.591
- Then you know how badly she was hurt.
- Yes.

12:37.799 --> 12:42.596
- Do you think she staged the attack?
- We need help. Mr Arden's choking to death!

12:45.599 --> 12:47.976
See? See what happened?

12:50.938 --> 12:53.148
I told you you couldn't handle any more!

12:55.943 --> 12:57.986
Call 911!

12:59.488 --> 13:02.324
Hal? Can you speak?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.287
He's in ventricular fibrillation.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.499
I need 75mg of lidocaine
and one amp of epinephrine.

13:10.582 --> 13:15.212
- Stat.
- Get a defibrillator! He's cyanotic.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.382
- Come on, Hal, help me.
- Come on, Hal.

13:18.507 --> 13:22.553
- One, two, three, four.
- The ambulance is on the way.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.597
I'm losing him.
What's taking so long?!

13:25.681 --> 13:29.017
Still no pulse.
Where's that crash cart?!

13:32.688 --> 13:36.358
Hal Arden's been my patient
since he came here eight years ago.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.944
- This really is a setback.
- A setback?

13:39.027 --> 13:42.865
Hal was part of a group of patients
I've been treating for 11 months.

13:42.948 --> 13:47.953
- But Alzheimer's isn't treatable.
- It's an experimental drug called Depranil...

13:48.036 --> 13:51.164
...that increases acetylcholine in the brain.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.877
I've read that the clinical benefits
are marginal at best.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.128
Well, yes.

13:56.211 --> 14:02.301
But these patients show cognitive abilities
well beyond anything that's been reported.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.803
So he was actually getting better?

14:04.887 --> 14:09.725
Before he started receiving the drug
he could hardly complete a sentence.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.940
Look... It's not much
to get excited about, my work.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.902
Most of these people
are on the downhill slide.

14:19.985 --> 14:24.573
If I can make them comfortable,
maybe prolong a life, it's all they expect.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.825
But to reverse an illness...

14:26.909 --> 14:30.913
Would it be possible for us to see
other patients in your test group?

14:30.996 --> 14:33.540
- Sure, if you want to.
- Yeah.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.232
- Where'd you get that?
- Aw, it was Hal's.

14:59.191 --> 15:02.194
Since he's not here any more,
why can't I have it?

15:02.319 --> 15:05.989
Because you have enough.
I give you enough. It's our secret.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.538
Aw, come on, Gung. It's makin' me better.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.082
Too much is very bad.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.460
Very bad. No more for you.

15:21.171 --> 15:25.300
I want you to stand behind Ben, Eddie,
because Ben's taller.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.887
And... Oh, Gloria,
would you come on over here?

15:28.971 --> 15:33.642
That man there, that's Leo Kreutzer.
During the Depression he was a WPA artist.

15:33.725 --> 15:38.188
- Quite a good one, too, I'm told.
- Hello, Mabel. Don't you look lovely!

15:38.272 --> 15:41.441
- Is he receiving the same treatment as Hal?
- Yes.

15:41.525 --> 15:46.864
When he came to us he couldn't draw a circle.
Now... Well, you can see for yourself.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.452
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm behind on rounds.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.122
Can I get a copy of Hal's autopsy results?

15:55.247 --> 15:57.541
- Of course.
- Thank you.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.710
May I sit down, Leo?

16:08.969 --> 16:14.099
Leo, we're with the FBI. We have
some questions that we'd like to ask you.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.019
Leo's a brilliant artist, you know.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.771
Oh, don't be so modest, Leo.

16:21.565 --> 16:26.195
President Kennedy has one of
his paintings in the White House.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.993
Dr Grago tells us that you haven't
worked in years, that the medicine...

16:33.076 --> 16:35.245
It ain't the medication.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.415
What is it, then?

16:40.250 --> 16:44.463
OK, Rembrandt, dinner time.
Dorothy, legs up and straight ahead.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.799
- You don't want a flat tyre.
- Wait! Leo's not finished.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.052
Leo can finish with you later.

16:50.135 --> 16:54.264
- No, no... He still has to draw the rest.
- He'll do it later, honey.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.644
Come on, Leo. Don't make me
embarrass you in front of your friends.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.363
Come on, Scully. Let's get out of here.

17:18.163 --> 17:23.292
To find a treatment and cure for Alzheimer's,
do you realise how important that would be?

17:23.377 --> 17:26.380
If it'd keep anybody
out of a place like that, yes.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.925
- I wouldn't say those people were cured.
- Any progress at all...

17:30.008 --> 17:33.595
I hope somebody's making progress
cos we have a big goose egg.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.558
- Checking out of room 206 and 210, please.
- Certainly, sir.

17:41.979 --> 17:47.317
- What if there's a connection?
- Between the rape case and the Alzheimer's?

17:47.359 --> 17:50.696
When they're not drawing pictures,
they're sex offenders?

17:50.779 --> 17:53.824
Dr Grago's drug therapy
produces acetylcholine.

17:53.907 --> 17:59.371
Too much cholinergic activity can cause
a psychotic state similar to schizophrenia.

17:59.454 --> 18:03.375
You think Michelle Charters
was raped by a 74-year-old schizophrenic?

18:03.500 --> 18:07.754
- It's possible.
- An invisible 74-year-old schizophrenic?

18:07.838 --> 18:11.550
Maybe it's not the medication.
Maybe it's the place itself.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.846
Are you saying it's haunted?
You've been working with me for too long.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.017
I'm talking about an environmental reason
behind what's happening.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.022
The disinfectant couldn't mask that smell.
Who knows what's behind the walls?

18:25.105 --> 18:29.985
Some fungal contaminants have been known
to cause delusions, dementia, violence.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.739
- Why hasn't it affected the other residents?
- Maybe it has.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.994
You're looking too hard
for something that's not there.

18:39.077 --> 18:43.582
I think Michelle Charters concocted
this story to get out of a job she hates.

18:43.665 --> 18:48.170
Her lip required 13 stitches. The blow to
her head caused a subdural haematoma.

18:48.253 --> 18:52.341
That's quite a concoction.
I want to talk to a few more of the patients.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.511
We can catch the same flight out
tomorrow night.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.642
This is gourmet fare.
Be a good girl and open wide.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.436
- No, no, no. Please don't.
- Come on.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.982
- Come on, open up, honey. Come on!
- No, please don't. I don't want...

19:12.319 --> 19:15.989
OK, that's fine, Dorothy.
Starve to death. See if I care.

19:18.867 --> 19:23.413
Why aren't you eating your food, Leo?
What's the matter?

19:23.497 --> 19:26.959
It's Dorothy. She needs more.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.127
We both do.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.130
What you have is enough.

19:32.214 --> 19:36.552
It's not working for us,
not like it works for the others.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.971
- We need more.
- No!

19:40.639 --> 19:43.141
No. Eat your food, please.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.645
I'll come back and pick up your tray.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.527
It's OK, Dorothy.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.572
Don't worry.

19:56.655 --> 20:00.158
I think Stan has some more
hidden away somewhere.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.327
It'll be all right.

20:05.873 --> 20:09.168
- Why are you being so stubborn?
- I'm not. I like it here.

20:09.251 --> 20:13.839
- A year ago you were begging to live with us.
- Well, things change.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.134
Look, Dad, I am sorry about
what happened to Mr Arlen.

20:17.217 --> 20:21.138
- Arden. His name was Arden.
- I finished your packing, Mr Phillips.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.349
I'm gonna make sure
you didn't forget anything.

20:24.433 --> 20:29.104
OK. Don't worry. Just pull your car up front.
I'll make sure he gets down OK.

20:29.188 --> 20:31.565
- Thank you.
- He's gonna be just fine.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.532
- Can I help you?
- We'd like a word with Mr Phillips.

20:40.616 --> 20:44.411
- I'm his daughter. What is this about?
- We're with the FBI.

20:44.494 --> 20:48.874
We have a few questions
concerning his medical treatment.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.503
He's in there packing.
I'm about to take him home.

20:52.628 --> 20:55.005
Is there anything I can help you with?

20:56.131 --> 21:02.679
It's sad. My two girls won't even visit their
grandfather. They're too afraid to come here.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.682
It's hard for anyone, including the residents.

21:05.766 --> 21:11.271
That's why we decided that whatever time
he's got left, we want him to spend it with us.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.483
- How many years has he been here?
- Almost three.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.819
We didn't have a choice.
Jack and I both work.

21:17.903 --> 21:21.573
The doctor said that he needed
24-hour nursing assistance.

21:21.657 --> 21:24.493
He doesn't seem to need
much assistance now.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.371
Has his improvement been that pronounced?

21:28.580 --> 21:31.166
I thought I was bringing him here to die.

21:31.250 --> 21:36.213
They told me he'd only get worse -
the physical deterioration, the dementia.

21:36.338 --> 21:40.467
- And now it's like he's a different person.
- Do you have any idea why?

21:41.552 --> 21:46.348
It has something to do with Dr Grago's
treatment. Dad won't talk to me about it.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.851
He's just too angry.

21:48.934 --> 21:54.064
He was so angry when I brought him here.
Now he's angry that I wanna take him home.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.067
I don't know that he's ever gonna forgive me.

21:59.319 --> 22:05.534
I'd like to say I'm gonna miss you, Stan. But
the truth is, you are a royal pain in the butt.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.203
Hey! Where you goin'?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.248
Don't make me chase you, old man.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.501
Hey!

22:16.920 --> 22:19.506
What are you, a track star all of a sudden?

22:52.122 --> 22:56.418
OK, stop messin' around, Stan.
Crawl back in that window right now!

22:57.461 --> 22:59.546
You crawl back in there!

23:08.013 --> 23:11.016
Don't think I'm comin' over there to get you.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.186
I'd just as soon let you fall
and break your neck!

23:14.269 --> 23:17.481
Do you hear me, Stan? Do you hear me?

23:21.902 --> 23:25.697
Help me! Somebody help me, please!

23:25.781 --> 23:27.866
I'm gonna fall!

23:54.601 --> 23:56.687
Help!

24:02.442 --> 24:04.194
Help me!

24:04.736 --> 24:06.613
Give me your hand.

24:06.697 --> 24:08.699
- Come on. Come on!
- I can't...

24:10.492 --> 24:12.578
- Grab it!
- I can't!

24:17.291 --> 24:19.501
Argh!

24:39.396 --> 24:41.481
Oh, my God!

24:55.245 --> 24:59.583
They paged me. I got a message -
an orderly fell out a fourth-floor window?

24:59.666 --> 25:02.836
Apparently. Either that or he was pushed.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.464
- Was Stan involved?
- We're trying to find out.

25:05.547 --> 25:11.386
- Stan was with him just prior to the accident.
- You're not suggesting he could've done it?

25:13.555 --> 25:17.518
There's been two deaths in 24 hours.
Stan's been present before both.

25:17.601 --> 25:21.230
No, no. That's impossible.
He has a degenerative hip disease.

25:21.355 --> 25:25.067
- No way could he get to the fourth floor.
- What about an elevator?

25:25.150 --> 25:28.529
- They haven't worked for years.
- Maybe he was helped.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.739
Helped? By whom?

25:32.783 --> 25:34.868
I don't know.

25:36.495 --> 25:39.331
The postmortem on Hal Arden.
Did you get it yet?

25:39.414 --> 25:43.836
- No, but they promised they'll fax it today.
- Can we see if it's come in?

25:43.877 --> 25:46.046
Sure. What do you expect to find?

25:47.506 --> 25:50.717
I'm not sure exactly.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.772
Why are they questioning him?

26:03.897 --> 26:06.483
It's routine procedure.

26:07.192 --> 26:10.070
Are they gonna want to keep him here?

26:10.153 --> 26:12.197
You'll have to ask Dr Grago.

26:12.322 --> 26:17.744
- Oh, God! If my mother was alive...
- How can I handle this by myself?

26:17.828 --> 26:21.039
I don't know. I have other things
to deal with right now.

26:21.123 --> 26:24.126
- Well, so do I. I'd just like some help.
- Excuse me.

26:24.209 --> 26:28.463
- Are you the only one on?
- Yes. Upshaw never showed up for work.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.591
Nobody's ever listening to me!

26:30.716 --> 26:35.888
I said something was going on! I told you
it had to do with Mr Arden and Mr Phillips.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.266
Forget it.

26:43.228 --> 26:46.857
Can you please explain to me
what's going on around here?

26:46.940 --> 26:48.984
Shoo! Shoo!

26:49.067 --> 26:51.153
Go away! Go, go away!

26:52.112 --> 26:54.198
Leave me alone!

26:54.364 --> 26:57.618
Go back! Don't come any closer!

26:58.243 --> 27:02.122
Go back in your room, Dorothy.
I'll send an orderly in to see you.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.416
- No, no, they're in there.
- Who?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.585
All of them.

27:08.837 --> 27:13.300
- There's nobody in your room, Dorothy.
- Here they come! You'll see.

27:14.635 --> 27:18.597
All right, now. You be nice.
I don't want any more of your dirty tricks!

27:18.680 --> 27:20.766
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Mm.

27:24.061 --> 27:27.940
No! No, no, no!
I don't... I don't wanna go back in there.

27:28.774 --> 27:31.777
No! No, I don't...

27:33.695 --> 27:36.698
It's senile dementia. This is just an episode.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.203
You leave her be. Don't you touch her!

27:41.286 --> 27:45.624
Now, shoo! Go away! Go away!
Don't you get any ideas, mister!

27:48.126 --> 27:50.212
Excuse me.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.511
Now don't you follow her!

28:02.683 --> 28:05.519
- This is it.
- Is the toxicology there?

28:05.602 --> 28:07.688
Yes.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.901
- This shouldn't be here.
- What's that?

28:12.985 --> 28:16.989
- Ibotenic acid. How did that get in his blood?
- What's ibotenic acid?

28:17.072 --> 28:19.908
- I think it's a kind of poison.
- Mulder...

28:19.992 --> 28:25.622
Scully, look at this. Hal Arden had ibotenic
acid in his blood. Somebody poisoned him.

28:26.540 --> 28:29.835
Well, not necessarily.
This is only a trace amount.

28:30.419 --> 28:35.340
But small amounts can cause hallucinations,
which is what a patient is having right now.

28:35.424 --> 28:38.302
But where did they get it?

28:38.468 --> 28:41.138
Excuse me. You've gotta come quickly.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.691
Oh, my God!

28:53.358 --> 28:56.153
- This is fantastic.
- What's going on here?

29:01.992 --> 29:04.077
Leo?

29:12.711 --> 29:14.796
It's incredible.

29:19.218 --> 29:22.763
You've got an Asian orderly working here.
What's his name?

29:22.846 --> 29:26.350
- Uh... Gung, I think.
- Do you know where he is?

29:26.433 --> 29:28.519
Somewhere down in the basement.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.574
Upshaw.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.423
You must believe me. I didn't kill him.

32:44.506 --> 32:47.467
- But it's your mushroom crop, isn't it?
- Yes.

32:48.135 --> 32:53.056
- Who else would have buried him there?
- Why were you growing them?

32:53.140 --> 32:55.225
For medicinal purposes.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.895
Were you feeding them to the residents?

32:57.978 --> 33:01.064
Yes. But only in small amounts.

33:01.607 --> 33:03.650
Why?

33:03.775 --> 33:06.236
Because it makes them feel better.

33:06.820 --> 33:10.407
- It makes them feel better or it kills them?
- No.

33:10.908 --> 33:13.535
Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they?

33:14.828 --> 33:19.208
It's from my prefecture in my country.
They've been used for centuries.

33:19.291 --> 33:21.376
For what purpose?

33:21.460 --> 33:25.047
In my country our customs are different.

33:25.172 --> 33:27.508
You're not in your country now.

33:27.591 --> 33:32.012
You're hired here to care for
these people under our guidelines.

33:32.095 --> 33:36.808
Where I come from,
many generations live under one roof.

33:36.892 --> 33:41.813
As children, our grandparents live with us.
We feel a duty to take care of them.

33:42.773 --> 33:45.108
It isn't like that in this country.

33:45.901 --> 33:50.739
We respect our old people
as we respect our ancestors.

33:51.240 --> 33:56.203
We don't send them away to die,
like Stan and Hal.

33:56.286 --> 34:01.834
- These people get excellent medical care.
- But they're not treated with respect.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.670
Hal's family never came to visit him once.

34:06.046 --> 34:10.967
And the orderlies treat the residents
worse than dogs.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.303
No one is mistreated here.

34:13.387 --> 34:17.683
- You are not here to see.
- All right! Gung, who killed the orderly?

34:17.808 --> 34:19.893
Who buried him in that room?

34:21.853 --> 34:25.148
Something has gone very wrong.

34:26.149 --> 34:32.114
The mushrooms we take to speak with the
dead, to see our ancestors in the spirit world.

34:33.532 --> 34:37.619
But the spirit in this place is very angry...

34:38.786 --> 34:41.915
...and the souls that died here
continue to suffer.

34:42.791 --> 34:46.210
And now they have been awakened.

34:46.837 --> 34:50.174
Are you saying that a spirit
killed this man Upshaw?

34:51.632 --> 34:53.217
Yes.

34:53.302 --> 34:56.346
They've taken revenge for their mistreatment.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.641
How are the mushrooms taken?

35:00.934 --> 35:05.230
Dried, mixed with many herbs,
made into powder.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.525
We should make sure
nobody else takes them.

35:08.650 --> 35:14.281
You check on the other patients.
Gung, come with me. Let's go.

35:42.059 --> 35:44.144
Come in, please.

35:56.073 --> 35:58.158
Someone's taken them all.

36:05.624 --> 36:07.835
- I think you're right.
- About?

36:07.918 --> 36:13.632
What's been happening here is a result of the
medication, but not the doctor's medication.

36:13.715 --> 36:18.387
Mushrooms aren't medication. They're good
on burgers but they don't raise the dead.

36:18.470 --> 36:23.225
Shamans have been using them for centuries
to gain entrance to the spirit world.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.186
You've been reading
too much Carlos Castaneda.

36:26.270 --> 36:28.939
All right. Ask any anthropologist, then.

36:29.606 --> 36:34.695
I know. A shaman gets intoxicated, he has
dreams or hallucinations and interprets them.

36:34.778 --> 36:37.656
I don't think it's any more magical than that.

36:37.739 --> 36:41.368
I don't know how else to explain
what's happening here.

36:42.536 --> 36:46.248
Well, I think these mushrooms
are a poison to the system...

36:46.331 --> 36:48.458
...and that's what killed Hal Arden.

36:48.542 --> 36:53.672
And raped Michelle Charters and killed those
two orderlies? Something's been unleashed.

36:53.755 --> 36:58.468
I don't know how to explain it,
but it has something to do with those pills.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.438
Daddy?

37:10.272 --> 37:12.482
Daddy, what are you taking?

37:12.566 --> 37:14.818
What are you putting in your mouth?

37:16.403 --> 37:19.823
Go away! You go away! Go away!

37:19.907 --> 37:24.203
Go away! You leave me!
Leave us alone! Go on!

37:24.286 --> 37:27.247
Oh! Run. Run while you can.

37:27.331 --> 37:29.374
Go on, run! Run...

37:30.709 --> 37:35.214
Go away! Go away! You leave us alone!

37:35.339 --> 37:38.008
- Dorothy, I need you!
- Leave Leo alone.

37:38.091 --> 37:40.260
- Please!
- Leave him alone. Leo!

37:41.094 --> 37:43.180
Leave him alone...

37:43.764 --> 37:46.183
You leave him. You leave him!

37:48.268 --> 37:51.438
Oh... Oh, no! Stop!

37:53.190 --> 37:55.275
Stop them!

37:56.610 --> 37:59.780
Please! Argh! Help!

38:14.002 --> 38:16.088
Help me! Please!

38:16.171 --> 38:17.714
Argh!

38:26.223 --> 38:28.433
Mulder? What's going on?

38:29.393 --> 38:31.520
Mulder?

38:36.567 --> 38:37.651
Mulder?!

38:38.318 --> 38:41.572
Scully! Turn off the water main!

38:42.656 --> 38:44.658
Turn off the water main!

38:48.412 --> 38:51.123
They're trapped and it's filling with water!

38:51.206 --> 38:53.917
- What?
- Where's the main water shut-off?

38:54.042 --> 38:56.086
I don't know.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.922
Gung will know.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.091
Keep trying the door.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.806
You've gotta get up.

39:07.890 --> 39:10.017
Come on, you've gotta get up.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.853
Come on.

39:26.033 --> 39:28.118
It's stuck.

39:32.539 --> 39:35.584
See if you can find something to force it with.

39:53.143 --> 39:55.229
I can't open the drains.

40:01.151 --> 40:03.612
Please! Please, my father needs help.

40:07.449 --> 40:10.619
My father took something.
I'm afraid he's dying.

40:11.370 --> 40:14.081
You stay with him. I'll get help.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.548
Dr Grago!

40:22.673 --> 40:25.259
- Dr Grago...
- Sealed tight.

40:25.926 --> 40:30.013
- Do you have any atropine in your kit here?
- I might. Yes, I think so.

40:30.097 --> 40:35.394
Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions.
I think he might have poisoned himself.

40:39.231 --> 40:40.440
Just hang on.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.001
They're gone.

41:45.297 --> 41:47.382
They're gone!

41:49.259 --> 41:51.345
They're all gone.

41:59.353 --> 42:01.396
You OK, Mulder?

42:02.356 --> 42:04.399
Yeah, fine.

42:15.786 --> 42:21.083
In response to the unexplained
incidents at the Excelsis Dei home...

42:21.166 --> 42:26.797
...the Massachusetts Dept of Public Health has
assumed all administrative authority there.

42:26.880 --> 42:31.718
They detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid
in more than half the residents tested...

42:31.802 --> 42:35.347
...though these levels have dissipated rapidly.

42:35.430 --> 42:42.729
Dr John Grago has been replaced and his trial
use of the drug Depranil has been suspended.

42:42.855 --> 42:47.025
For his part in manufacturing
and distributing an illicit substance...

42:47.109 --> 42:51.280
...Gung Bituen was remanded to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service...

42:51.363 --> 42:54.700
...and is awaiting repatriation to <font color="#FF0000">Malaysia</font>.

42:54.783 --> 42:58.745
There are reportedly no efforts being made
to study the mushrooms.

42:58.829 --> 43:02.583
The government settled
Michelle Charters' lawsuit out of court...

43:02.666 --> 43:05.460
...though no clear blame has been placed.

43:05.544 --> 43:09.047
Witnesses were unreliable
due to dramatic relapses...

43:09.131 --> 43:13.760
...and a general reversal in their progress
with Alzheimer's disease.

43:13.844 --> 43:15.929
I'm gonna go now, Daddy.

43:17.306 --> 43:19.850
I'll see you again soon.

43:19.933 --> 43:22.019
Maybe next week.

43:37.958 --> 43:43.252
