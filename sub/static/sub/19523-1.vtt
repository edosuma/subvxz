00:20.068 --> 00:21.703
No, I can't. I can't.

00:21.704 --> 00:22.936
Come on, sweetheart.

00:22.937 --> 00:25.906
<i>We're nearly there, it's okay.</i>

00:55.637 --> 00:58.306
I think I need a drink.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.809
I'll make us some coffee.

01:06.981 --> 01:08.482
Don't leave me alone.

01:08.483 --> 01:10.117
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:10.118 --> 01:12.753
Well, that's not
what the doctor said.

01:12.754 --> 01:14.655
That is not true.

01:14.656 --> 01:16.890
He said that when they
do the surgery on Monday,

01:16.891 --> 01:17.892
if it is benign,

01:17.893 --> 01:19.660
they could possibly just
cut the whole thing out.

01:19.661 --> 01:22.331
No, he said the odds weren't good.

01:22.730 --> 01:24.598
Well, why don't they lie?

01:24.599 --> 01:27.268
You know, he used to lie.

01:27.468 --> 01:30.538
Just thought that we should be ready

01:30.539 --> 01:32.739
<i>in case it isn't benign,</i>

01:32.740 --> 01:33.875
because then the

01:33.876 --> 01:36.077
operation could potentially be...

01:36.078 --> 01:37.879
Fatal.

01:38.046 --> 01:40.848
I think we should try and remain positive.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.152
It's all over.

01:44.153 --> 01:45.553
What's the point in being miserable?

01:45.554 --> 01:47.021
We don't know what's gonna happen.

01:47.022 --> 01:49.691
You're going to die.

01:50.058 --> 01:52.361
Listen, darling.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.696
If that does happen then,

01:56.097 --> 01:57.899
I am ready.

01:59.066 --> 02:00.233
You're so young.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.904
I've got everything I could
possibly ever have wanted.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.771
I've got a wonderful husband

02:04.772 --> 02:05.807
<i>who loves me,</i>

02:05.808 --> 02:07.774
<i>I've got two great kids,</i>

02:07.775 --> 02:08.574
and I'm an architect,

02:08.576 --> 02:10.511
which is what I always dreamed of.

02:10.512 --> 02:13.114
There's not a single thing in
my life that I would change,

02:13.115 --> 02:15.549
and there aren't many
people who could say that.

02:15.550 --> 02:18.219
You really wouldn't change anything?

02:18.854 --> 02:21.523
Not even moving to Canada?

02:25.193 --> 02:27.527
Look, if I do really
only have five days left,

02:27.528 --> 02:30.198
I want everything to remain normal

02:30.199 --> 02:31.666
so I can enjoy my life

02:31.667 --> 02:33.668
<i>exactly as it is.</i>

02:33.669 --> 02:35.836
Yeah, that makes sense.

02:35.837 --> 02:37.738
Oh yeah, and the
doctor said to avoid

02:37.739 --> 02:39.573
<i>any unnecessary stress,</i>

02:39.574 --> 02:41.241
<i>so please don't tell anyone,</i>

02:41.242 --> 02:42.710
<i>and that actually includes Kaitlyn.</i>

02:42.711 --> 02:43.978
Kaitlyn, hi, yeah.

02:43.979 --> 02:45.947
<i>Your mother has a brain tumour,</i>

02:45.948 --> 02:47.749
<i>she's gonna die.</i>

02:48.683 --> 02:50.485
Yeah.

02:51.552 --> 02:52.986
Yeah.

02:52.987 --> 02:55.690
And she doesn't want anyone to know.

02:55.691 --> 02:59.494
So if you could keep it to yourself.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.961
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:19.514 --> 03:20.715
Grace.

03:20.716 --> 03:21.716
What did the doctor say?

03:21.717 --> 03:22.849
He said I'm fine.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.018
But you blacked out,

03:24.019 --> 03:25.085
<i>it had to be something serious.</i>

03:25.086 --> 03:26.721
He said low blood pressure
and to drink more water,

03:26.722 --> 03:27.788
but I'm fine.

03:27.789 --> 03:29.590
I'll let everyone know.
We've all been so worried.

03:29.591 --> 03:30.924
<i>Absolutely nothing to worry about.</i>

03:30.925 --> 03:32.926
Grace. Are you okay?

03:32.927 --> 03:35.662
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely fine, thank you.

03:35.663 --> 03:37.465
Hi, Grace.

03:50.878 --> 03:51.878
Hey.

03:51.879 --> 03:52.913
Hi.

03:52.914 --> 03:54.549
Just low blood pressure, huh?

03:54.550 --> 03:55.816
Yeah, yeah.

03:55.817 --> 03:57.050
<i>Hey, you know the Millwood Project?</i>

03:57.051 --> 03:58.619
Yes.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.853
<i>Is there any chance
that the gang could get</i>

03:59.854 --> 04:02.556
that model ready a couple of
days earlier for my approval?

04:02.557 --> 04:03.792
Yeah, I think so.

04:03.793 --> 04:05.825
But, you know, our deadline's
not for another week, right?

04:05.826 --> 04:07.762
Yeah, I know, it's just
that I wanted to have time

04:07.763 --> 04:09.263
to check last minute details.

04:09.264 --> 04:13.033
<i>So, do you think they
could get it ready by, say,</i>

04:13.034 --> 04:14.836
tomorrow?

04:15.236 --> 04:17.036
Um, yeah, I mean, we could try.

04:17.038 --> 04:19.374
- Thanks.
- Okay.

04:43.197 --> 04:44.999
It's after eight.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.667
Yeah, just-just tidying up

04:47.668 --> 04:48.869
<i>a few loose ends.</i>

04:48.870 --> 04:50.939
Goodnight, Ben.

04:51.139 --> 04:52.941
Night.

04:59.281 --> 05:00.948
She went to work?

05:00.949 --> 05:02.950
Yeah, and look at the time.

05:02.951 --> 05:05.119
Who works overtime when you're dying?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.854
Shouldn't she be out

05:06.855 --> 05:08.688
making her last wishes come true?

05:08.689 --> 05:09.857
No, she's-no she's got that,

05:09.858 --> 05:12.092
what's that word that she
always says about me because

05:12.093 --> 05:13.861
I passed out at that party and

05:13.862 --> 05:16.830
<i>she said I was drunk
and I was just sleeping?</i>

05:16.831 --> 05:18.667
Alcoholism?

05:19.701 --> 05:20.700
Last straw.

05:20.701 --> 05:21.736
That's two words.

05:21.737 --> 05:22.736
Denial.

05:22.737 --> 05:23.837
Denial, yes, yes.

05:23.838 --> 05:26.006
Denial, she's in denial.

05:26.007 --> 05:28.842
But maybe you're overreacting.

05:28.843 --> 05:30.311
<i>You said yourself</i>

05:30.312 --> 05:31.912
<i>if they find out that the
brain tumour is benign</i>

05:31.913 --> 05:34.314
when they do the surgery on Monday,

05:34.315 --> 05:35.849
they may be able to cut it out,

05:35.850 --> 05:39.521
<i>do a little radiation
if necessary and</i>

05:40.021 --> 05:40.888
she could be fine.

05:40.889 --> 05:43.691
Doctor said he wanted her to be ready.

05:44.925 --> 05:46.727
Fuck.

05:49.865 --> 05:51.665
I don't think I can do this.

05:51.666 --> 05:53.133
I'm feeling dizzy all the time and I-

05:53.134 --> 05:54.268
I can't find a pulse.

05:54.269 --> 05:57.905
Dad, this isn't about us.

05:57.906 --> 06:00.340
You know, it's kind of
about us, too, isn't it?

06:00.341 --> 06:02.143
We have to help her.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.410
Help her what?

06:03.411 --> 06:04.778
Help her be ready.

06:04.779 --> 06:07.449
Well, she-she says she is ready.

06:07.949 --> 06:08.948
You're living your life,

06:08.949 --> 06:11.318
and then someone says
you could die on Monday.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.287
Who could be ready? Think about it.

06:13.288 --> 06:15.222
No, I'm trying not to think about it.

06:15.223 --> 06:16.289
I'm no good at denial.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.159
That's-that's why I drink!

06:18.160 --> 06:21.830
Well, she's supposed to avoid stress.

06:25.901 --> 06:27.869
We have to be the strong ones.

06:28.836 --> 06:30.638
Yeah.

06:30.838 --> 06:32.773
I can be strong.

06:34.943 --> 06:36.042
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

06:36.043 --> 06:37.845
Hi.

06:38.313 --> 06:39.379
Oh, darling, I'm sorry I'm late,

06:39.380 --> 06:41.314
just finalizing this
massive project at work.

06:41.315 --> 06:44.084
Okay, Mum, you sit down,
I can-I can take this.

06:47.788 --> 06:48.989
Do you want a pillow?

06:48.990 --> 06:50.323
Stop fussing.

06:50.324 --> 06:52.994
I don't actually think I'm going to die.

06:54.930 --> 06:56.996
Well, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll get
you a pillow for your feet.

06:56.997 --> 06:58.398
- I don't want any.
- I'll get two pillows.

06:58.399 --> 06:59.999
- Want any pillows.
- Three pillows.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.670
And then if you change your mind...

07:03.105 --> 07:05.004
The doctor said
it was a possibility.

07:05.005 --> 07:06.941
He didn't say dig a grave.

07:06.942 --> 07:08.777
Mum,

07:09.211 --> 07:12.412
I have some news that I think
will make you really happy.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.948
Your paper on gender and
the anti-nuclear movement

07:14.949 --> 07:15.950
is being published?

07:15.951 --> 07:17.484
Way better than that.

07:17.485 --> 07:19.520
The university have offered
you that research position?

07:19.521 --> 07:22.022
- Oh my god, Kaitlyn.
- Even better.

07:22.023 --> 07:23.825
I'm in love.

07:24.259 --> 07:26.025
You?

07:26.026 --> 07:27.896
Yeah, I know.

07:28.497 --> 07:29.864
But he's wonderful.

07:29.865 --> 07:30.864
He?

07:30.865 --> 07:31.866
<i>What?</i>

07:31.867 --> 07:33.234
Of course, he.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.035
Oh my god.

07:35.370 --> 07:36.302
<i>Did you think I was a lesbian?</i>

07:36.303 --> 07:38.438
No, of course I didn't.

07:38.439 --> 07:40.273
What? You were the one who told me that

07:40.274 --> 07:42.008
high heels are bad for your back,

07:42.009 --> 07:43.443
and you said have standards,

07:43.444 --> 07:45.845
don't just fall for
any guy who comes along.

07:45.846 --> 07:47.914
I know, honey. It's just that-

07:47.915 --> 07:50.417
it's just that if you had been a lesbian,

07:50.418 --> 07:52.253
I would've been fine with that.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.155
Lesbians get fewer STDs,

07:54.156 --> 07:56.525
no unwanted pregnancies.

07:56.791 --> 07:59.059
Not that I don't think you
would make a wonderful mother

07:59.060 --> 08:00.994
in the distant future.

08:00.995 --> 08:02.796
But, hey.

08:02.898 --> 08:04.999
So, you're in love!

08:05.000 --> 08:07.669
With a man, yay!

08:07.802 --> 08:09.003
What's he like?

08:09.004 --> 08:10.905
Well, he's a writer.

08:10.906 --> 08:11.905
Oh, shit.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.073
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

08:13.074 --> 08:14.575
He's nothing like-

08:14.576 --> 08:17.578
and I-I know you won't
have time to meet him this-

08:18.012 --> 08:19.412
this week, but I'm-

08:19.413 --> 08:21.047
I'm sure you'd love him.

08:21.048 --> 08:22.316
I have time.

08:22.317 --> 08:23.917
<i>Really?</i>

08:23.951 --> 08:26.587
Shouldn't you be flying to Machu Picchu?

08:26.588 --> 08:27.587
Machu Picchu?

08:27.588 --> 08:29.189
<i>Yeah, remember when we-</i>

08:29.190 --> 08:30.058
we made you go to Disneyland?

08:30.059 --> 08:32.225
You kept saying that you'd always dreamt

08:32.226 --> 08:33.293
of going to Machu Picchu

08:33.294 --> 08:34.327
and here you were

08:34.328 --> 08:36.130
in fucking Disneyland.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.163
Well, that was years ago,

08:37.164 --> 08:38.898
and I'm not going anywhere.

08:38.899 --> 08:40.701
<i>Well,</i>

08:40.902 --> 08:41.902
you know what I mean.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.169
I would love to meet him.

08:43.171 --> 08:45.505
I just want you to see what an amazing job

08:45.506 --> 08:46.374
you did as a mother.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.109
Zoe's got that fantastic new career,

08:49.110 --> 08:51.545
and I found my soul-mate.

09:01.056 --> 09:03.725
What shall I read?

09:05.125 --> 09:06.627
Middlemarch.

09:09.865 --> 09:12.333
A good 899 pages.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.769
It's too long.

09:20.475 --> 09:23.009
<i>I know what I don't</i>

09:23.010 --> 09:24.912
want to read.

09:28.115 --> 09:30.785
<i>What's the shortest?</i>

09:39.427 --> 09:41.328
Hi, I was ah...

09:42.129 --> 09:44.364
You know, I'd quite like to ah...

09:44.365 --> 09:47.035
<i>I mean, if you would, um.</i>

09:48.168 --> 09:52.840
I know we haven't, uh,
been doing it much lately,

09:53.240 --> 09:56.509
<i>uh, which is probably
my fault, but um.</i>

09:56.510 --> 09:58.912
You know, my back's a lot better,

09:58.913 --> 10:00.714
and um,

10:01.015 --> 10:03.017
<i>I just don't want you to die</i>

10:03.018 --> 10:04.918
<i>wishing you'd had more sex,</i>

10:04.919 --> 10:07.120
which is apparently quite common.

10:07.121 --> 10:09.123
<i>At the same time, I don't
want you to think that</i>

10:09.124 --> 10:11.124
I'm the kind of man who would

10:11.125 --> 10:13.761
force a dying woman to-

10:17.065 --> 10:19.032
And it's not because, uh,

10:19.033 --> 10:21.435
I'm facing the fact that
I might have to spend

10:21.436 --> 10:23.303
the rest of my life without sex.

10:23.304 --> 10:24.404
No, no, no, no.

10:24.405 --> 10:26.340
<i>That's-that's, no.</i>

10:26.341 --> 10:28.008
No, this is-

10:28.009 --> 10:29.310
this is really just

10:29.311 --> 10:31.112
not about me.

10:31.278 --> 10:32.880
<i>No, so-</i>

10:36.150 --> 10:38.952
I'm just letting you know that, uh,

10:39.086 --> 10:41.088
any-time you want,

10:42.090 --> 10:44.125
I am available,

10:45.225 --> 10:46.694
<i>not now, I would
guess, from your face.</i>

10:46.695 --> 10:48.162
<i>You know, that's fine,
you read your book.</i>

10:48.163 --> 10:49.562
That's fine, that's fine.

10:49.563 --> 10:51.365
But, uh,

10:51.566 --> 10:53.066
any-time in the next

10:53.067 --> 10:55.236
24, 48 hours,

10:56.236 --> 10:58.238
I'm here for you.

10:59.975 --> 11:02.110
Also 72 hours.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.110
How many nights home do you have left?

11:04.111 --> 11:05.713
- Four.
- Four!

11:05.714 --> 11:08.383
<i>Four, that's loads of time, four.</i>

11:09.183 --> 11:11.185
<i>Yeah, or-or-or
cuddles.</i>

11:11.186 --> 11:13.186
Cuddles, too, all the cuddles you want.

11:13.187 --> 11:14.754
And if the cuddles lead to sex,

11:14.755 --> 11:16.757
yay!

12:08.243 --> 12:10.044
You

12:10.278 --> 12:13.081
are the love of my life.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.716
How dare you come here?

12:16.717 --> 12:17.718
Why, I had to come.

12:17.719 --> 12:18.786
You did not have to come.

12:18.787 --> 12:20.387
Our daughter needed me.

12:20.388 --> 12:22.189
She's been sobbing all
the way here on the plane.

12:22.190 --> 12:23.657
- Zoe's here?
- Of course Zoe's here.

12:23.658 --> 12:25.158
Oh god, Kaitlyn must have called her.

12:25.159 --> 12:26.393
She's gone straight to bed.

12:26.394 --> 12:27.661
<i>She said you'd need your sleep but-</i>

12:27.662 --> 12:30.331
So you crawl into my bed?

12:30.532 --> 12:32.666
You're still a beautiful woman, Gracie.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.734
I am calling a cab.

12:33.735 --> 12:35.134
You need to go to a hotel.

12:35.135 --> 12:36.302
No, I'm not going anywhere.

12:36.303 --> 12:37.437
I'm not leaving.

12:37.438 --> 12:38.439
Never again, never.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.273
Grace, are you speaking?

12:40.274 --> 12:42.410
Uh huh.

12:44.078 --> 12:45.678
Richard.

12:45.679 --> 12:48.348
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi, Tom.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.817
Wow.

12:50.818 --> 12:53.487
Uh, I heard voices, but uh-

12:53.687 --> 12:55.857
well, I didn't expect to see you.

12:56.356 --> 12:58.224
Really, Tom? Really?

12:58.225 --> 12:59.359
Yeah, yeah.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.161
Really, yeah.

13:01.830 --> 13:03.162
Congratulations on the new novel.

13:03.163 --> 13:05.165
I haven't had a chance to read it yet,

13:05.166 --> 13:06.834
<i>but they said on the
radio you might win</i>

13:06.835 --> 13:08.569
a second Tolstoy Prize.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.737
Why on earth would I want
to talk about my book.

13:10.738 --> 13:12.540
Gracie has a brain tumour!

13:15.743 --> 13:17.478
Yeah, I don't really read your books.

13:17.479 --> 13:18.678
I was just being polite.

13:18.679 --> 13:20.747
Well, I don't think now is
the time for politeness, Tom.

13:20.748 --> 13:22.715
So I'm just gonna come
right out and say this, okay?

13:22.716 --> 13:24.750
I'm gonna win Grace back.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.720
Tom, I think you need to go to bed.

13:26.721 --> 13:29.723
No, you need to avoid unnecessary stress.

13:29.724 --> 13:30.858
Please, please, please, go to bed.

13:30.859 --> 13:31.691
I'll deal with this.

13:31.692 --> 13:32.893
Because I think that needs an answer.

13:32.894 --> 13:35.329
- No, I will answer it for you.
- Well, I was going to say-

13:35.330 --> 13:36.596
No, I know what you're gonna say, darling.

13:36.597 --> 13:37.730
We have been married forever.

13:37.731 --> 13:39.133
Not forever.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.533
Yeah, and I'm not that predictable.

13:40.534 --> 13:43.237
I could, theoretically, still surprise you.

13:45.606 --> 13:46.606
No.

13:46.607 --> 13:47.608
No, you couldn't.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.410
Please, go to bed.

13:49.844 --> 13:50.610
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Yes, I'll see you later.

13:50.611 --> 13:52.412
Bye, sweetheart.

13:53.413 --> 13:56.217
Okay, well, I'm just upstairs.

13:57.284 --> 13:58.284
So,

13:58.285 --> 13:59.519
what was he gonna say to me?

13:59.520 --> 14:00.753
I don't care.

14:00.754 --> 14:02.556
I would say the same thing to you

14:02.557 --> 14:03.657
if Tom were not my husband.

14:03.658 --> 14:05.392
If the only husband I had ever had

14:05.393 --> 14:06.759
was a lying little shit

14:06.760 --> 14:08.662
who cheated on me when
I had a newborn baby!

14:08.663 --> 14:10.631
Why are you exaggerating?

14:10.831 --> 14:12.532
She wasn't newborn, she was

14:12.533 --> 14:13.633
six months old.

14:13.634 --> 14:15.234
This is insane.

14:15.235 --> 14:16.769
You know, I might
surprise you all and live.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.437
That would be fantastic.

14:18.438 --> 14:20.239
<i>Well, wouldn't you only
want me because I'm dying?</i>

14:20.240 --> 14:21.642
If you thought you were stuck with me

14:21.643 --> 14:22.643
for the rest of your life,

14:22.644 --> 14:24.644
you never would have got
on that plane in London.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.279
No.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.281
I've changed.

14:27.282 --> 14:28.282
Well, I haven't.

14:28.283 --> 14:30.450
I still hate you and I
want you out of my house

14:30.451 --> 14:32.652
by the time I get up in the
morning, do you understand?

14:32.653 --> 14:35.055
Unless you want to be the first to die.

14:40.928 --> 14:43.598
I can read Middlemarch.

14:47.335 --> 14:48.801
<i>I'm smart.</i>

14:48.802 --> 14:50.537
I read fast.

14:50.538 --> 14:52.339
Why not?

14:53.875 --> 14:55.942
Did you tell him what I was gonna tell him?

14:55.943 --> 14:57.811
Go to sleep.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.948
I'm gonna start with chapter one.

15:00.447 --> 15:02.316
Did you tell him I love you?

15:02.317 --> 15:03.950
Yeah, yeah.

15:03.951 --> 15:06.087
Skip the prelude.

15:06.486 --> 15:08.288
So is he leaving?

15:09.591 --> 15:10.590
Yes.

15:10.591 --> 15:13.393
Brooke had the kind of beauty-

15:13.695 --> 15:14.760
Yeah, he's leaving.

15:14.761 --> 15:17.264
Of course, he's leaving.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.301
So, what's for breakfast?

15:22.236 --> 15:23.570
"This is very kind
of you," said Dorothea,

15:23.571 --> 15:25.305
<i>looking up at Mr.
Casaubon with delight.</i>

15:25.306 --> 15:26.505
"It is noble. After all,

15:26.506 --> 15:27.840
people may have some vocation"-

15:27.841 --> 15:29.375
You made him breakfast in bed?

15:29.376 --> 15:31.311
You never made me breakfast in bed.

15:31.312 --> 15:32.378
It's for Zoe.

15:32.379 --> 15:33.379
Oh, yeah.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.182
Yeah, okay.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.849
Carry on.

15:36.850 --> 15:38.652
You're still here?

15:41.755 --> 15:44.425
Thought you would've gone by now.

15:47.794 --> 15:49.596
Oh, Mum.

15:54.802 --> 15:56.369
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:56.370 --> 15:57.903
No, that's not what Kaitlyn said.

15:57.904 --> 15:59.873
I'm sure they can
cut the whole thing out.

15:59.874 --> 16:01.608
I need to have a little bit of radiation.

16:01.609 --> 16:03.578
It'll be fine.

16:03.979 --> 16:06.412
I'm just sorry that you had
to leave your great new job

16:06.413 --> 16:07.748
in London and come home.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.416
<i>I've got to go to work because</i>

16:09.417 --> 16:11.350
<i>the model has arrived
for the new project.</i>

16:11.351 --> 16:12.652
You're going to work?

16:12.653 --> 16:13.920
Yeah.

16:13.921 --> 16:15.388
Which goes to show what a little fuss

16:15.389 --> 16:16.757
about nothing this all is.

16:16.758 --> 16:17.791
Okay.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.593
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

16:22.663 --> 16:23.930
Oh, Mum.

16:23.931 --> 16:25.065
I brought dad with me.

16:25.066 --> 16:27.033
Is that okay?

16:27.034 --> 16:29.036
Yeah.

16:29.037 --> 16:30.838
The more, the merrier.

16:33.908 --> 16:35.709
Hey.

16:39.514 --> 16:40.781
Right.

16:40.782 --> 16:41.947
I'm off.

16:41.948 --> 16:43.517
You're going to work?

16:43.518 --> 16:44.950
Of course, I am.

16:44.951 --> 16:46.787
I'm not the jerk who makes
loads of money writing

16:46.788 --> 16:48.788
pretentious, self-serving lies about

16:48.789 --> 16:50.923
someone I used to be married to.

16:50.924 --> 16:51.925
Speaking of which,

16:51.926 --> 16:53.960
I expect you to be gone
by the time I get home.

16:53.961 --> 16:55.329
I have only written about our marriage

16:55.330 --> 16:56.397
in my first novel.

16:56.398 --> 16:58.398
Which won one of the
biggest prizes in the world.

16:58.399 --> 17:00.801
<i>It's still in print,
a modern classic.</i>

17:00.802 --> 17:02.101
They teach it in schools.

17:02.102 --> 17:03.237
But nobody knew that was based on you.

17:03.238 --> 17:07.074
The fragile but brilliant
hero's neurotic first wife

17:07.075 --> 17:08.075
<i>named Kelly?</i>

17:08.076 --> 17:09.575
<i>As in Grace Kelly?</i>

17:09.576 --> 17:11.077
Everybody knew!

17:11.078 --> 17:13.412
I don't have time for this in so many ways.

17:13.413 --> 17:14.413
Richard, please,

17:14.414 --> 17:16.115
let this be our final goodbye.

17:16.116 --> 17:20.119
The man who makes dying
feel like an easier option.

17:28.363 --> 17:29.595
<i>You're not really going to work?</i>

17:29.596 --> 17:30.831
<i>I am going to work.</i>

17:30.832 --> 17:32.833
<i>Nah, you've got a secret life.</i>

17:32.834 --> 17:35.636
- A rendezvous with a lover.
- I've got a meeting at 10.

17:35.836 --> 17:37.104
<i>Jesus.</i>

17:37.105 --> 17:38.471
<i>Is this really who you've become?</i>

17:38.472 --> 17:39.873
The kind of person that goes to the office

17:39.874 --> 17:41.107
when they're dying?

17:41.108 --> 17:43.143
I don't actually think I am dying.

17:43.144 --> 17:44.745
Yeah, you know what, you may be,

17:44.746 --> 17:46.479
and on Monday.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.449
And, just look at you.

17:49.450 --> 17:50.584
<i>What? I-</i>

17:50.585 --> 17:51.852
I like my suit.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.655
<i>I'm not talking about your suit.</i>

17:55.623 --> 17:56.856
You're not afraid! Why not?

17:56.857 --> 17:58.458
Don't tell me how I feel.

17:58.459 --> 18:00.025
I always know how you feel.

18:01.028 --> 18:03.063
The great genius at work.

18:03.064 --> 18:05.664
How am I feeling now, Richard?

18:05.665 --> 18:06.799
Do the words,

18:06.800 --> 18:09.001
fuck you, come to mind?

18:09.002 --> 18:10.804
And not in a good way.

18:10.805 --> 18:11.604
You know, you're right.

18:11.605 --> 18:13.073
We should've just done it then.

18:13.074 --> 18:14.141
Done what?

18:14.142 --> 18:16.144
This.

18:18.145 --> 18:20.680
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:22.016 --> 18:23.617
Do you remember

18:23.651 --> 18:25.085
when our marriage was falling apart,

18:25.086 --> 18:26.819
we were walking down
some street in Islington,

18:26.820 --> 18:29.489
and you started crying?

18:29.490 --> 18:31.825
<i>And you said that you didn't
want to be one of those</i>

18:31.826 --> 18:33.960
<i>little people who gets
married and divorced,</i>

18:33.961 --> 18:34.960
and married and divorced,

18:34.961 --> 18:36.095
you wanted to be a big person

18:36.096 --> 18:37.897
with one great love,

18:37.898 --> 18:39.466
and if we were gonna be

18:39.467 --> 18:41.902
<i>petty little people
with little lives then</i>

18:41.903 --> 18:43.836
why don't we just lie down
in the middle of the road

18:43.837 --> 18:45.905
until some kind bugger ran over us and

18:45.906 --> 18:47.173
put us out of our misery?

18:47.174 --> 18:48.842
Did I ever really think
love was that important?

18:48.843 --> 18:50.576
God, I was so young.

18:50.577 --> 18:51.978
Love is that important.

18:51.979 --> 18:53.447
Get up!

18:53.448 --> 18:54.248
<i>Don't do this!</i>

18:54.249 --> 18:55.316
I've only got four days to live,

18:55.317 --> 18:58.452
and I don't have time to
save your worthless life.

18:59.186 --> 19:01.188
Everything okay?

19:01.788 --> 19:03.589
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.659
Finish your breakfast.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.460
I heard yelling.

19:07.461 --> 19:09.363
Yeah, sure.

19:09.663 --> 19:11.064
I'll see you tonight.

19:11.065 --> 19:13.201
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

19:14.201 --> 19:16.337
I love you.

19:16.737 --> 19:18.539
Oh, Grace?

19:19.073 --> 19:21.742
Do we have any of those muffins?

19:22.143 --> 19:24.978
Yeah, I-I think we got
one left in the fridge.

19:24.979 --> 19:27.248
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

19:28.950 --> 19:30.885
And you still love me.

19:33.086 --> 19:34.086
So,

19:34.087 --> 19:36.389
how long in the microwave?

19:36.824 --> 19:38.091
Uh,

19:38.092 --> 19:39.692
just about 30 seconds.

19:39.693 --> 19:42.495
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

19:45.266 --> 19:46.600
Get run over,

19:46.601 --> 19:47.700
I'm going to work.

19:47.701 --> 19:48.969
How can you go to work?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.237
<i>'Cause it's a big project for me.</i>

19:50.238 --> 19:51.570
<i>I spent ages on this.</i>

19:51.571 --> 19:52.572
And now I've missed my bus.

19:52.573 --> 19:55.741
I'm gonna be late for
my meeting, you bastard!

19:55.742 --> 19:57.110
I know why you're not afraid.

19:57.111 --> 19:59.246
You're not afraid because
you're already dead.

19:59.247 --> 20:01.714
<i>Well, I'm here to
bring you back to life!</i>

20:01.715 --> 20:05.518
Well, wouldn't that be cruel
under the circumstances?

20:14.595 --> 20:16.129
Okay.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.932
Let's do it.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.401
Tada!

20:21.736 --> 20:22.802
Wow.

20:22.803 --> 20:24.605
<i>There's the pond.</i>

20:24.872 --> 20:26.906
And the playground.

20:26.907 --> 20:30.877
No units smaller than 243 square feet.

20:31.811 --> 20:34.881
<i>This is the biggest project I've
ever been lead architect on,</i>

20:34.882 --> 20:36.883
and so much work has gone into it and

20:36.884 --> 20:39.854
<i>we really gave it our all.</i>

20:40.153 --> 20:42.689
Just look at it.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.825
<i>The little cars and</i>

20:45.826 --> 20:48.328
the little people.

20:50.163 --> 20:52.832
Months of work.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.571
And it's...

20:58.306 --> 21:00.641
it-it...

21:02.309 --> 21:04.010
It's shit.

21:19.660 --> 21:20.794
Hey.

21:20.795 --> 21:21.795
You okay?

21:21.796 --> 21:22.796
Yeah.

21:22.797 --> 21:23.829
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

21:23.830 --> 21:25.664
'Cause you-you seem kind of,

21:25.665 --> 21:26.665
um, you know, different.

21:26.666 --> 21:28.735
No, no, no, same old Grace.

21:28.736 --> 21:30.002
You know, if anything's happening,

21:30.003 --> 21:31.337
you can tell me, right?

21:31.338 --> 21:33.473
'Cause I'm your friend.

21:33.807 --> 21:35.374
Well...

21:35.375 --> 21:37.377
I knew it.

21:37.678 --> 21:39.480
Okay.

21:40.681 --> 21:41.981
Tell me everything.

21:41.982 --> 21:45.785
I am a little bit
distracted, because I, uh...

21:47.288 --> 21:49.790
I've got...

21:51.959 --> 21:53.761
<i>I've got-I've got-</i>

21:56.230 --> 21:57.730
I've got a house guest.

21:57.731 --> 21:59.532
Oh.

22:00.734 --> 22:01.867
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>

22:01.868 --> 22:03.702
<i>That explains everything.</i>

22:03.703 --> 22:05.904
'Cause I had my in-laws
visiting last month,

22:05.905 --> 22:07.707
and I could not wait for that to end.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.043
<i>Okay, is that on Tom's
side of the family?</i>

22:10.044 --> 22:11.243
Uh, more mine.

22:11.244 --> 22:13.278
Right, but I thought your parents were gone

22:13.279 --> 22:14.713
and then you're an only child.

22:14.714 --> 22:18.017
Yeah, actually, it's my first husband.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.052
Oh, Richard Feekery.

22:19.053 --> 22:21.755
So, Richard Feekery is
in your house right now.

22:21.756 --> 22:23.856
I love his books.

22:23.857 --> 22:25.892
<i>Stolen Dreams is
magnificent, 'cause,</i>

22:25.893 --> 22:28.294
like, he just understands women

22:28.295 --> 22:30.396
<i>and those sex scenes, come on.</i>

22:30.397 --> 22:32.198
<i>You must have bonked your brains out</i>

22:32.199 --> 22:33.999
when you were married to him.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.735
Okay, if I were you,

22:35.736 --> 22:37.269
<i>I would sneak into his bed
in the middle of the night</i>

22:37.270 --> 22:39.172
<i>and have my way with him.</i>

22:39.173 --> 22:41.274
<i>'Cause you only live once, right?</i>

22:41.275 --> 22:42.875
Yeah.

22:42.876 --> 22:43.876
<i>'Cause I'm thinking about it,</i>

22:43.877 --> 22:45.144
I can't help it.

22:45.145 --> 22:46.145
Phew!

22:46.146 --> 22:47.146
Is it hot in here?

22:47.147 --> 22:49.449
It's hot, let's open a window.

22:49.950 --> 22:52.619
Thank you for letting me know.

22:59.426 --> 23:01.928
Yeah, her Tolstoy Prize winning ex

23:01.929 --> 23:04.598
is visiting from London.

23:05.098 --> 23:07.767
<i>Some girls don't know
how lucky they are.</i>

23:12.940 --> 23:14.473
So, last night I told her that

23:14.474 --> 23:17.177
my life is going great.

23:18.112 --> 23:19.345
Is it?

23:19.346 --> 23:20.814
Yes.

23:20.815 --> 23:22.781
And you should do the same because

23:22.782 --> 23:25.585
she can't die in peace if
she's worried that we're losers.

23:27.855 --> 23:28.721
So you agree?

23:28.722 --> 23:29.756
That we're not losers? I don't know.

23:29.757 --> 23:31.790
I think that it's a
little bit early to tell.

23:31.791 --> 23:33.460
We still have a lot of
life to live, look at-

23:33.461 --> 23:36.261
Do you agree that we should
help her die in peace?

23:36.262 --> 23:37.730
Of course I do.

23:37.731 --> 23:39.065
Then why did you tell your father?

23:39.066 --> 23:40.799
They were married.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.868
When they were very young.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.738
And then they were divorced.

23:44.739 --> 23:46.540
He's like

23:47.007 --> 23:48.475
the first guy you ever kissed
at some stupid birthday party

23:48.476 --> 23:49.808
in somebody's basement.

23:49.809 --> 23:51.877
<i>Like, who even remembers him?</i>

23:51.878 --> 23:54.547
Kenny Slitzer.

23:54.981 --> 23:56.082
He was wonderful.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.950
She's supposed to avoid stress.

23:57.951 --> 23:59.352
<i>He said that he wants to be there</i>

23:59.353 --> 24:01.521
at her bedside when it happens.

24:01.955 --> 24:04.022
That is the definition of inappropriate.

24:04.023 --> 24:06.826
He said that she's the love of his life.

24:07.027 --> 24:08.761
My dad is the love of her life,

24:08.762 --> 24:13.233
or she wouldn't have left
your dad for my dad, right?

24:13.968 --> 24:15.300
I guess.

24:15.301 --> 24:16.469
<i>And if someone is the
love of your life,</i>

24:16.470 --> 24:18.872
then by definition you are
the love of their life too.

24:18.873 --> 24:20.373
I don't know.

24:20.374 --> 24:23.042
Our soul-mates can't
have different soul-mates.

24:23.544 --> 24:25.245
Yeah.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.047
Yeah.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.981
Yeah, you're right because
then life would just

24:28.982 --> 24:30.783
be too sad.

24:31.251 --> 24:32.885
Girls.

24:32.886 --> 24:34.386
- Hi, Tom.
- Yeah, Dad?

24:34.387 --> 24:35.454
I've thought of something that'll make

24:35.455 --> 24:37.257
your mum really happy.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.991
I knew you would.

24:38.992 --> 24:40.793
Pizza!

24:42.930 --> 24:44.030
Oh, shit.

24:47.401 --> 24:50.002
"We are not afraid of
telling over and over again

24:50.003 --> 24:52.037
how a man comes to love a woman

24:52.038 --> 24:54.575
and be wedded to her...

24:55.409 --> 24:57.211
You're still here?

24:57.877 --> 24:59.746
Of course I'm still here.

25:00.013 --> 25:01.914
And suspiciously alone.

25:01.915 --> 25:03.182
Please don't tell me
you murdered my husband

25:03.183 --> 25:05.418
just to have a subject
for your next pot-boiler.

25:05.419 --> 25:07.420
Nah, they've gone to get pizza.

25:07.421 --> 25:08.755
But,

25:08.756 --> 25:10.390
I think it's
supposed to be like a big surprise.

25:10.391 --> 25:12.192
I love pizza.

25:14.060 --> 25:15.194
<i>Richard, let me say this gently.</i>

25:15.195 --> 25:17.864
Get the fuck out of my house.

25:19.032 --> 25:20.833
I've missed you so much.

25:21.035 --> 25:22.302
I never should have left you.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.103
You didn't leave me.

25:24.104 --> 25:25.905
I left you.

25:26.173 --> 25:27.306
Or at least I threw your
clothes out of the window

25:27.307 --> 25:28.508
and changed the locks.

25:28.509 --> 25:30.043
We could have worked things out.

25:30.044 --> 25:31.110
I don't think so.

25:31.111 --> 25:33.046
Things weren't quite the same

25:33.047 --> 25:34.447
after a drunk woman rang me to tell me

25:34.448 --> 25:35.547
she was fucking my husband,

25:35.548 --> 25:37.983
it just somehow took the
sparkle out of our marriage.

25:37.984 --> 25:40.286
I don't know why, it just did.

25:41.121 --> 25:42.488
I was an ass-hole.

25:42.489 --> 25:44.992
Finally we agree on something.

25:45.058 --> 25:47.927
But you should have waited
for me to stop being an ass-hole

25:47.928 --> 25:50.095
instead of getting
yourself knocked up by Tom.

25:50.096 --> 25:51.931
Tom saved my life.

25:51.932 --> 25:52.966
If you hadn't got pregnant,

25:52.967 --> 25:54.934
you never would have divorced me.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.370
Why do women always get pregnant
at such inopportune times,

25:57.371 --> 25:59.338
it should only happen
when the stars are aligned

25:59.339 --> 26:00.940
and true love is present,

26:00.941 --> 26:02.075
not

26:02.076 --> 26:03.075
when the condom breaks.

26:03.076 --> 26:05.011
Kaitlyn was not an accident.

26:05.412 --> 26:07.145
Okay, well, yes, she was.

26:07.146 --> 26:09.348
She was the best accident
that ever happened to me.

26:09.349 --> 26:10.650
You never regret children,

26:10.651 --> 26:11.950
you only regret the men

26:11.951 --> 26:13.085
that fathered them.

26:13.086 --> 26:14.953
You only slept with him for revenge.

26:14.954 --> 26:17.257
Loneliness, lust, revenge,

26:17.258 --> 26:19.059
rank them.

26:19.626 --> 26:21.361
Anyway.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.961
It was so long ago and,

26:22.962 --> 26:25.397
and now I'm happily married and dying.

26:25.398 --> 26:27.366
Not the best time to start dating your ex.

26:27.367 --> 26:28.902
And then you moved here

26:28.903 --> 26:30.103
because you still loved me

26:30.104 --> 26:31.437
and you didn't want to be tempted.

26:31.438 --> 26:33.105
<i>I did not move to
Toronto because of you.</i>

26:33.106 --> 26:34.106
Oh yes, you did.

26:34.107 --> 26:35.107
I did not.

26:35.108 --> 26:36.909
But now I'm here

26:37.144 --> 26:38.945
and

26:39.546 --> 26:41.915
I love you, too.

26:42.415 --> 26:44.917
You don't know what love is.

26:44.984 --> 26:47.452
<i>It requires to occasionally
think about someone else.</i>

26:47.453 --> 26:48.287
You only think about

26:48.288 --> 26:51.125
the ever fascinating Richard Feekery.

26:52.058 --> 26:53.058
Tom is a real person.

26:53.059 --> 26:54.693
Tom knows what love is.

26:54.694 --> 26:56.863
I know what love is.

26:57.064 --> 26:58.932
Pizza time!

27:07.674 --> 27:09.142
You know, this wine you bought, Richard,

27:09.143 --> 27:11.811
it goes really well with pizza.

27:13.146 --> 27:16.348
It's a Chablis Grand Crus, 1987.

27:16.349 --> 27:18.351
Yeah? Is it? Well,

27:18.551 --> 27:20.018
I think I'll just

27:20.019 --> 27:21.821
have a little drop more.

27:29.063 --> 27:30.063
Oh, come on, everyone,

27:30.064 --> 27:31.431
stop looking so depressed.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.699
<i>There's no reason to give up hope.</i>

27:32.700 --> 27:34.433
I believe in miracles.

27:34.434 --> 27:36.302
<i>And-and doctors can be wrong.</i>

27:36.303 --> 27:38.104
Do you know 40% of hospital stays

27:38.105 --> 27:40.373
have at least one incident
of medical malpractice?

27:40.374 --> 27:41.740
That's true.

27:41.741 --> 27:43.075
That's very reassuring.

27:43.076 --> 27:44.177
Thank you.

27:44.178 --> 27:46.345
Yeah, it's not what the doctor said.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.381
It's-I just have a bad feeling about this.

27:48.382 --> 27:50.184
<i>And you know,</i>

27:50.317 --> 27:52.118
I'm a little psychic.

27:53.053 --> 27:55.320
Remember, I had that dream about the dog,

27:55.321 --> 27:56.588
and then the following week,

27:56.589 --> 27:58.591
the next door neighbour's dog

27:58.592 --> 28:00.192
was run over by a police car.

28:00.193 --> 28:02.194
<i>And then last summer, I kept saying,</i>

28:02.195 --> 28:03.261
something bad is gonna happen,

28:03.262 --> 28:04.329
something bad's gonna happen,

28:04.330 --> 28:08.067
and-and then they had that
earthquake in Argentina.

28:08.634 --> 28:10.068
Darling, it's so nice to see you.

28:10.069 --> 28:12.104
I want a blow-by-blow
account of your new job.

28:12.105 --> 28:13.139
Zoe has her new career,

28:13.140 --> 28:15.074
and I found the perfect guy.

28:15.075 --> 28:16.209
<i>You did a great job, Mama.</i>

28:16.210 --> 28:17.242
We're winners!

28:17.243 --> 28:18.478
Yay!

28:18.479 --> 28:19.746
You're in love?

28:19.747 --> 28:21.114
Yes.

28:21.115 --> 28:22.114
Let me give you some advice.

28:22.115 --> 28:23.115
I don't like advice.

28:23.116 --> 28:24.116
This is good advice.

28:24.117 --> 28:25.250
Especially from you.

28:25.251 --> 28:26.752
<i>You're just my sister's father,</i>

28:26.753 --> 28:28.220
<i>which is bad enough.</i>

28:28.221 --> 28:29.489
I just want to be normal.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.524
You got to grow up with
your mum and your dad.

28:31.525 --> 28:33.526
<i>I was always being
schlepped back and forth</i>

28:33.527 --> 28:34.760
to England on a plane.

28:34.761 --> 28:35.761
You think it's been fun

28:35.762 --> 28:37.529
seeing the disappointment on people's faces

28:37.530 --> 28:39.231
when I say, no, I'm not

28:39.232 --> 28:41.366
the famous Richard Feekery's daughter?

28:41.367 --> 28:43.102
People pay a lot
of money for my opinions.

28:43.103 --> 28:44.670
I don't believe in a market economy.

28:44.671 --> 28:45.671
Neither do I, but

28:45.672 --> 28:48.240
it'd be stupid not to
cash the cheques, right?

28:48.241 --> 28:49.674
<i>And this advice might
change your life.</i>

28:49.675 --> 28:51.143
I get wiser every year.

28:51.144 --> 28:52.545
I don't want my life changed.

28:52.546 --> 28:53.578
Richard,

28:53.579 --> 28:54.579
leave Kaitlyn alone,

28:54.580 --> 28:55.681
she doesn't like advice.

28:55.682 --> 28:58.018
<i>And anyway, you're not wise,</i>

28:58.249 --> 28:59.251
you've just got a nice prose style.

28:59.252 --> 29:01.054
If this man you love

29:01.055 --> 29:02.287
does something to hurt you,

29:02.288 --> 29:03.288
give him another chance.

29:03.289 --> 29:04.323
Oh god!

29:04.324 --> 29:06.058
Don't

29:06.059 --> 29:07.727
change the locks and

29:07.728 --> 29:09.261
<i>throw his clothes out of the window.</i>

29:09.262 --> 29:10.729
We're not living together.

29:10.730 --> 29:12.531
What are you even talking about?

29:12.532 --> 29:14.133
I am talking

29:14.134 --> 29:16.402
about your mother
shutting me out of her life

29:16.403 --> 29:18.136
<i>instead of giving me another chance</i>

29:18.137 --> 29:20.073
<i>and therefore ruining all our lives.</i>

29:20.074 --> 29:21.540
Well, if my mum
had thought that way,

29:21.541 --> 29:23.342
I wouldn't exist.

29:23.343 --> 29:25.345
I'd be an only child.

29:25.546 --> 29:26.679
I wouldn't.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.347
<i>Well, then I'd be alive, but</i>

29:29.348 --> 29:31.384
I'd be eating pizza somewhere else.

29:39.358 --> 29:41.093
It's not important.

29:41.728 --> 29:44.397
Nothing is important but my Gracie.

29:44.730 --> 29:45.631
<i>Where were we?</i>

29:45.632 --> 29:47.299
Please don't go back to where we were,

29:47.300 --> 29:48.335
<i>please, please.</i>

29:48.336 --> 29:50.169
Maybe some things aren't
meant to be discussed

29:50.170 --> 29:51.437
while eating pizza.

29:51.438 --> 29:54.107
She doesn't like being called Gracie.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.308
She prefers Grace.

29:56.309 --> 29:57.777
She doesn't like being called Gracie

29:57.778 --> 29:59.879
by other people because Gracie

29:59.880 --> 30:01.380
was my pet name for her.

30:01.381 --> 30:04.182
She has wonderful memories
of being called Gracie.

30:04.183 --> 30:05.218
Intimate memories,

30:05.219 --> 30:06.286
<i>passionate memories.</i>

30:06.287 --> 30:09.454
Memories that she doesn't
want tarnished by newer

30:09.455 --> 30:12.658
less significant husbands
calling her Gracie.

30:12.659 --> 30:14.326
Horrible memories.

30:14.327 --> 30:16.428
Like this one right now.

30:20.134 --> 30:21.934
Sorry.

30:23.237 --> 30:25.038
Hi.

30:25.638 --> 30:27.239
<i>Uh, no, no, I'm in Canada.</i>

30:27.240 --> 30:29.408
I flew home last night because-

30:29.409 --> 30:31.211
um-

30:31.244 --> 30:33.045
What?

30:33.346 --> 30:34.881
<i>Yes, I know where my dad is.</i>

30:34.882 --> 30:35.882
<i>He's sitting right next to me.</i>

30:35.883 --> 30:37.616
Oh, fuck.

30:37.617 --> 30:39.251
She can hear you.

30:39.252 --> 30:41.888
I can hear you, yes.

30:43.656 --> 30:45.559
Yeah, uh huh.

30:47.528 --> 30:49.261
I know, I know.

30:49.262 --> 30:51.098
What-what can I say?

30:54.268 --> 30:56.103
<i>Uh huh.</i>

30:56.403 --> 30:58.905
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

31:00.907 --> 31:02.408
Do you want to know why?

31:02.409 --> 31:03.441
Do you want to know why?

31:03.442 --> 31:05.710
Because she is the love of my life.

31:05.711 --> 31:07.513
That's why.

31:09.449 --> 31:10.916
"She was
humiliated to find herself

31:10.917 --> 31:13.586
<i>a mere victim of feeling,</i>

31:14.387 --> 31:18.190
as if she knew nothing
except through that medium...

31:57.897 --> 31:59.464
Just cleaning out the fridge.

31:59.465 --> 32:00.766
<i>Mhm.</i>

32:00.767 --> 32:02.235
Hey, I'm not the stupid husband, Gracie.

32:02.236 --> 32:03.902
I'm the smart one.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.438
God.

32:05.439 --> 32:06.572
And you were always telling me

32:06.573 --> 32:07.973
I wasn't good enough.

32:07.974 --> 32:09.041
Why didn't you

32:09.042 --> 32:11.344
give me a call when you
lowered your expectations?

32:11.345 --> 32:13.345
Don't say things like that about Tom.

32:13.346 --> 32:14.779
Where were you all those
nights he was looking

32:14.780 --> 32:17.350
after the girls while I
was finishing my degree?

32:17.351 --> 32:19.352
Oh, yeah, I was just
obsessing about my writing.

32:19.353 --> 32:21.320
You mean, fucking.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.122
Stop.

32:23.490 --> 32:24.589
I'm just

32:24.590 --> 32:26.392
too tired for another
middle of the night argument.

32:26.393 --> 32:27.860
<i>Look, if I really am dying,</i>

32:27.861 --> 32:30.197
can't you let me die in peace?

32:30.364 --> 32:32.199
Truce.

32:36.470 --> 32:39.138
Just tell me you don't still hate me.

32:40.374 --> 32:41.874
Too exhausted to hate anyone.

32:41.875 --> 32:42.874
If you're so tired,

32:42.875 --> 32:45.212
why don't you go to sleep?

32:46.046 --> 32:49.049
Because you're afraid
you're not gonna wake up?

32:56.824 --> 32:59.326
You got something on your face.

32:59.826 --> 33:01.294
No, no, there.

33:01.295 --> 33:02.295
Oh, jeez, I'll get it.

33:02.296 --> 33:03.695
Here.

33:03.696 --> 33:04.963
I haven't got anything on my face.

33:04.964 --> 33:07.799
It's just your excuse to get near me.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.435
You can't blame me for trying.

33:10.436 --> 33:11.770
I mean, it's not over 'till it's over.

33:11.771 --> 33:13.405
Yeah, it's not a football match,

33:13.406 --> 33:15.074
it's my life.

33:15.075 --> 33:17.077
And mine.

33:28.855 --> 33:31.524
I'm so glad that you kissed me.

33:31.924 --> 33:33.726
Because I feel

33:34.560 --> 33:36.362
absolutely nothing.

33:37.396 --> 33:38.931
No regrets,

33:38.932 --> 33:40.399
no what ifs.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.069
We were right to split
up. You can go home now.

33:46.472 --> 33:48.406
You don't feel nothing.

33:48.407 --> 33:52.078
You look really disappointed.

33:52.546 --> 33:53.612
What did you expect,

33:53.613 --> 33:54.947
for it to play like a sex scene

33:54.948 --> 33:56.481
in one of your novels?

33:56.482 --> 33:58.550
<i>The sensitive but
manly hero kisses her,</i>

33:58.551 --> 34:00.952
she can't resist, who could,

34:00.953 --> 34:02.822
<i>at the touch of those magic fingers.</i>

34:02.823 --> 34:04.824
<i>She's writhing in ecstasy.</i>

34:04.825 --> 34:06.092
"Take me, baby!

34:06.093 --> 34:07.826
Right here on the kitchen floor."

34:07.827 --> 34:09.027
Yeah, alright, Gracie,

34:09.027 --> 34:10.495
you know I hate this, don't do that.

34:10.496 --> 34:11.964
Just one last fuck from the literary genius

34:11.965 --> 34:13.998
so I can die a truly satisfied woman.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.567
Would you stop it, alright?

34:15.568 --> 34:17.435
Unzip those pants, baby,

34:17.436 --> 34:18.904
and show me something really worth dying-

34:18.905 --> 34:21.574
Right, that's it. I'm just going to bed.

34:24.610 --> 34:26.411
Jam yesterday,

34:26.579 --> 34:27.879
jam tomorrow,

34:27.880 --> 34:29.714
and finally,

34:29.715 --> 34:31.516
jam today.

34:32.485 --> 34:35.155
And you're the smart wife.

34:41.161 --> 34:43.830
You just outmanoeuvred me, didn't you?

34:44.063 --> 34:45.864
Do you think you could clear all this up?

34:45.864 --> 34:47.899
I-I would but,

34:47.900 --> 34:49.534
hey, I'm dying.

34:49.536 --> 34:51.803
Don't throw away our last chance, Gracie.

34:51.804 --> 34:54.607
Your last chance came
and went years ago, honey.

34:58.778 --> 35:01.080
So, Mom's happy you're in love.

35:01.081 --> 35:02.647
Thrilled.

35:02.648 --> 35:05.151
She's meeting him tomorrow.

35:05.152 --> 35:06.618
Maybe I could meet someone too.

35:06.619 --> 35:08.520
You don't have much time.

35:08.521 --> 35:10.189
Please.

35:10.190 --> 35:11.189
Boys love me.

35:11.190 --> 35:12.792
It can't just be a hookup.

35:12.793 --> 35:14.026
But what if I think it's forever

35:14.027 --> 35:14.826
<i>and then we break up after-</i>

35:14.827 --> 35:17.363
It's not like she's gonna know.

35:17.563 --> 35:18.897
I better get to work.

35:18.898 --> 35:20.064
It's almost noon, Dad.

35:20.065 --> 35:21.167
Yeah, it's just

35:21.168 --> 35:22.935
I don't feel like working.

35:22.936 --> 35:25.605
<i>I don't know how your
mum is managing it.</i>

35:27.039 --> 35:28.841
I thought you were all going out.

35:28.842 --> 35:30.843
She should be
flying to Machu Picchu.

35:30.844 --> 35:33.044
I'll never forgive myself
for making her go to

35:33.045 --> 35:34.046
Disneyland instead.

35:34.047 --> 35:35.046
You were eight.

35:35.047 --> 35:36.047
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

35:36.048 --> 35:37.817
Tom should have known better.

35:37.818 --> 35:39.084
I would have taken her to Machu Picchu.

35:39.085 --> 35:40.084
Ah, come on.

35:40.085 --> 35:41.720
Everybody loves Disneyland.

35:41.721 --> 35:43.122
Peanut?

35:43.123 --> 35:46.058
<i>You remember me videoing
you dancing with Goofy?</i>

35:46.059 --> 35:48.728
Da-Dada-da
da.

35:49.795 --> 35:50.830
Yeah.

35:50.831 --> 35:52.864
Yeah, we had a great time.

35:52.865 --> 35:53.866
Well,

35:53.867 --> 35:55.869
apart from the food poisoning.

36:00.072 --> 36:01.073
Hi.

36:01.074 --> 36:03.209
Do any of you have a ladder?

36:03.210 --> 36:04.209
Uhhh, yeah.

36:04.210 --> 36:06.213
Yeah, I think so.

36:12.751 --> 36:14.754
You asked for this?

36:14.987 --> 36:16.120
Oh, thank you, yeah.

36:16.121 --> 36:18.290
Just leave it there.

36:19.826 --> 36:21.893
<i>Are you sure you're okay, Grace?</i>

36:21.894 --> 36:24.296
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:24.697 --> 36:26.700
Machu Picchu.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.667
I went there.

36:29.268 --> 36:31.271
Did you?

36:31.371 --> 36:33.506
I just went to Disneyland.

36:34.641 --> 36:36.776
Architecture 101.

36:37.610 --> 36:40.111
<i>Well, maybe you're right.</i>

36:40.112 --> 36:41.580
<i>We're in a bit of a rut.</i>

36:41.581 --> 36:43.781
<i>We could use some inspiration.</i>

36:43.782 --> 36:45.584
Or

36:45.885 --> 36:48.921
Depressing reminder of
what failures we've become.

36:48.922 --> 36:50.924
But they're beautiful.

36:54.594 --> 36:55.627
Hey, hey, careful.

36:55.628 --> 36:57.796
You don't want to black out again.

37:04.204 --> 37:06.406
I'll let you take that.

37:07.673 --> 37:08.674
Yeah?

37:08.675 --> 37:09.774
<i>You need to come home.</i>

37:09.775 --> 37:11.577
I'm busy.

37:11.644 --> 37:13.145
It's an emergency.

37:13.146 --> 37:15.281
Is it what you would consider an emergency

37:15.282 --> 37:17.951
or what I would consider an emergency?

37:18.018 --> 37:19.618
Well, at this stage in your life,

37:19.619 --> 37:20.752
everything's an emergency.

37:20.753 --> 37:22.254
Tell me what it is or I'm not coming.

37:24.757 --> 37:25.790
We need to talk over some

37:25.791 --> 37:26.792
things about Zoe.

37:26.793 --> 37:28.960
You wouldn't be using
our daughter as part of

37:28.961 --> 37:31.564
a lame scheme to seduce me, would you?

37:31.565 --> 37:33.899
Of course, not. Jesus!

37:33.900 --> 37:35.834
What do you think I am? My god.

37:35.835 --> 37:37.069
I'm-

37:37.070 --> 37:38.303
Oh, sorry.

37:38.304 --> 37:40.171
I'm sorry I-

37:40.172 --> 37:41.172
I apologize.

37:41.173 --> 37:43.343
Alright, I'm coming.

38:05.965 --> 38:07.934
Come upstairs.

38:25.751 --> 38:26.951
Ah!

38:26.952 --> 38:27.953
Thank you so much.

38:27.954 --> 38:30.056
I could really use a drink.

38:37.230 --> 38:38.930
What happened to the bed?

38:43.135 --> 38:47.039
Was there a window open or something?

38:47.239 --> 38:49.041
Richard.

38:49.842 --> 38:51.843
You know when Grace

38:51.844 --> 38:53.646
left you,

38:54.847 --> 38:57.517
how did you survive?

39:00.152 --> 39:02.154
What are you doing home?

39:02.155 --> 39:03.957
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

39:04.056 --> 39:06.925
I cancelled all the classes, I just...

39:07.860 --> 39:09.963
I was just not concentrating.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.832
I keep thinking about-

39:13.298 --> 39:15.468
I keep thinking...

39:16.268 --> 39:18.937
I keep thinking...

39:22.876 --> 39:26.010
I just don't think I can live without her.

39:32.818 --> 39:35.421
Can I have some more champagne?

39:35.422 --> 39:37.424
Thanks.

39:49.369 --> 39:51.171
I'm back.

39:51.971 --> 39:53.772
Come upstairs.

39:54.807 --> 39:57.176
If this is like the time
I came to pick up Zoe

39:57.177 --> 39:59.178
and you had sent her
to a friend's house and

39:59.179 --> 40:00.913
covered the bed with rose petals

40:00.914 --> 40:02.948
to remind me of the time
we had sex in the garden,

40:02.949 --> 40:06.051
I'll be really pissed off.

40:11.056 --> 40:12.791
Darling.

40:12.925 --> 40:14.392
Sweetheart.

40:14.393 --> 40:15.960
It's going to be okay.

40:15.961 --> 40:17.863
It's alright.

40:19.833 --> 40:21.801
You'll get through this, buddy.

40:23.969 --> 40:24.970
Was nice, though,

40:24.971 --> 40:26.939
that time in the garden.

40:29.943 --> 40:33.613
Could I have a little
more champagne, please?

40:41.019 --> 40:42.821
Thank you.

40:58.838 --> 41:00.171
Maybe that's enough, huh?

41:00.172 --> 41:02.175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:03.842 --> 41:06.011
And so, we meet again.

41:06.012 --> 41:07.814
Richard!

41:14.920 --> 41:16.321
I sincerely hope this is an illusion

41:16.322 --> 41:17.522
caused by your brain tumour.

41:17.523 --> 41:19.991
Yes, let's be civilized, shall we?

41:19.992 --> 41:21.993
We'll drink champagne and
deal with this like grown-ups.

41:21.994 --> 41:23.060
We are grown-ups.

41:23.061 --> 41:23.861
Do grown-ups steal

41:23.862 --> 41:25.062
other women's husbands, Gracie?

41:25.063 --> 41:26.198
Yes they do, some of them.

41:26.199 --> 41:27.198
As you should know.

41:27.199 --> 41:28.167
And I don't intend
stealing anyone's husband.

41:28.168 --> 41:30.569
And please, Tamara, don't call me Gracie.

41:30.570 --> 41:32.004
I told you she didn't like that.

41:32.005 --> 41:33.105
Look, alright, I'll handle this, Gracie.

41:33.106 --> 41:35.073
If he loved you he wouldn't
have left you for me.

41:35.074 --> 41:36.274
He did not leave me.

41:36.275 --> 41:37.308
That was in his novel.

41:37.309 --> 41:38.910
In real life, I kicked him out.

41:38.911 --> 41:39.912
You kicked him out

41:39.913 --> 41:40.913
because he was in love with me.

41:40.914 --> 41:42.446
And I knew you'd want your revenge one day.

41:42.447 --> 41:43.881
So now you want him back.

41:43.882 --> 41:45.082
Well, over my dead body.

41:45.083 --> 41:46.584
If it's dead bodies we're talking about,

41:46.585 --> 41:48.419
I think I might just
have the advantage here.

41:48.420 --> 41:49.587
Excuse me.

41:49.588 --> 41:50.522
Could somebody offer me a
glass of champagne, please?

41:50.523 --> 41:52.424
I'm the one who's just got off the plane.

41:52.425 --> 41:54.294
I will, and um,

41:54.960 --> 41:56.027
I'll have one myself.

41:56.028 --> 41:57.162
Thank you, Ted.

41:57.163 --> 41:58.363
It's Tom.

41:58.364 --> 42:00.299
I want you to know that none
of this is directed at you.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.301
No, no, no. I didn't think it was, no.

42:02.302 --> 42:04.102
Richard kind of trails chaos after him.

42:04.103 --> 42:05.571
<i>Do you know what he said to
me on the phone last night?</i>

42:05.572 --> 42:06.571
What my husband said to me.

42:06.572 --> 42:08.506
He said that Gracie was
the love of his life.

42:08.507 --> 42:10.042
Do you know how much that hurt me?

42:10.043 --> 42:12.044
I don't need another love of my life.

42:12.045 --> 42:13.312
I already have one.

42:13.313 --> 42:14.312
Who needs two?

42:14.313 --> 42:15.513
He's not the love of your life.

42:15.514 --> 42:16.915
She just said I was.

42:16.916 --> 42:17.915
The point is, Richard is all yours.

42:17.916 --> 42:20.118
Don't try and use reverse psychology on me.

42:20.119 --> 42:21.118
We can all do that.

42:21.119 --> 42:22.120
Richard's yours, go on.

42:22.121 --> 42:23.187
Take him!

42:23.188 --> 42:24.122
<i>Nice champagne, isn't it?</i>

42:24.123 --> 42:25.122
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

42:25.123 --> 42:26.058
I flew economy.

42:26.059 --> 42:27.158
A woman like me should never fly economy.

42:27.159 --> 42:29.560
They offered me water to
drink like I was a peasant.

42:30.429 --> 42:31.462
I don't mean to make
this situation any worse

42:31.463 --> 42:33.598
- than it already is
- Then I'll just call a cab.

42:33.599 --> 42:35.600
But I would just like to
clear up a couple of points

42:35.601 --> 42:37.134
that have been made, two points.

42:37.135 --> 42:38.002
Yeah, or you could just leave.

42:38.003 --> 42:41.874
First, I do not trail chaos behind me.

42:41.940 --> 42:43.408
Okay, yes, I used to.

42:43.409 --> 42:46.143
<i>But it's been many years
since I've trailed chaos.</i>

42:46.144 --> 42:48.980
So stop judging me on
the man that I used to be.

42:48.981 --> 42:51.082
And yes, I'm here because I love Gracie.

42:51.083 --> 42:52.484
I'm not ashamed of that.

42:52.485 --> 42:54.085
<i>I'm ashamed of leaving
her for this lunatic.</i>

42:54.086 --> 42:56.087
Oh, go ahead, stab me in the heart,

42:56.088 --> 42:58.089
why don't you, you bastard!

42:58.090 --> 42:59.957
Richard, that's
completely uncalled for,

42:59.958 --> 43:01.125
and to your own wife.

43:01.126 --> 43:02.393
You're such a gentleman, Ted.

43:02.394 --> 43:03.527
Right, and that's the second point.

43:03.528 --> 43:05.029
Yes, Tamara is technically speaking

43:05.030 --> 43:06.230
still my legal wife,

43:06.231 --> 43:07.399
<i>but it has been many years</i>

43:07.400 --> 43:09.234
since we have lived under the same roof,

43:09.235 --> 43:10.268
and even longer

43:10.269 --> 43:11.402
since we've slept together.

43:11.403 --> 43:13.171
You swore till death do we part.

43:13.172 --> 43:14.640
Yeah but I made the same vows to Gracie

43:14.641 --> 43:16.107
when we got married,

43:16.108 --> 43:17.509
so I don't think that's a winning point

43:17.510 --> 43:18.676
for your side of the argument.

43:18.677 --> 43:20.645
The last person you said it
to is the one that counts.

43:20.646 --> 43:22.113
No, no, no, no.

43:22.114 --> 43:23.515
Surely, the first is the binding pledge

43:23.516 --> 43:25.183
<i>that seals the deal, right?</i>

43:25.184 --> 43:26.384
<i>No, no, no, she doesn't
get to win by dying first.</i>

43:26.385 --> 43:27.520
That's cheating.

43:27.521 --> 43:30.187
Yeah, I think we're all a
little bit off topic here.

43:30.188 --> 43:32.290
Now, can I book someone a hotel?

43:32.291 --> 43:34.026
How dare you tell me to go to a hotel.

43:34.027 --> 43:35.026
That is not an insult.

43:35.027 --> 43:36.627
I will pay.

43:36.628 --> 43:38.062
<i>No, I'm not going to a hotel
and leaving my husband here</i>

43:38.063 --> 43:38.997
to fuck you.

43:38.998 --> 43:40.564
I will not fuck your husband, I promise.

43:40.565 --> 43:42.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

43:42.135 --> 43:44.201
if there's anything like that going on,

43:44.202 --> 43:46.038
as Gracie's husband and the
official love of her life,

43:46.039 --> 43:48.341
I'll be taking care of it.

43:49.175 --> 43:50.109
Oh my god.

43:50.110 --> 43:52.209
I just wish I stayed in the office today.

43:52.210 --> 43:53.210
Why were you at the office?

43:53.211 --> 43:54.212
You told me she was dying.

43:54.213 --> 43:56.415
No, no, no, no, she is dying.

43:56.416 --> 43:57.415
It's the end of my world.

43:57.416 --> 43:58.616
You poor darling man.

43:58.617 --> 44:00.419
No, no, no, you finish the
champagne, darling, it'll help.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.220
<i>Go on.</i>

44:01.221 --> 44:02.421
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.

44:02.422 --> 44:03.421
Please, Tom, no more.

44:03.422 --> 44:04.422
<i>Give it to me.</i>

44:04.423 --> 44:05.556
He wants a glass of champagne!

44:05.557 --> 44:06.797
Listen, I bought the champagne-

44:11.697 --> 44:12.964
Tamara.

44:12.965 --> 44:14.566
Zoe, darling!

44:14.567 --> 44:16.301
Come and give your stepmother a hug.

44:16.302 --> 44:18.569
<i>And Kaitlyn, look at
you, all grown up.</i>

44:18.570 --> 44:20.171
Come on, I want a hug from you, too.

44:20.172 --> 44:21.339
- <i>Come on.</i>
- Uh, oh, okay.

44:21.340 --> 44:22.640
Did you fly all the way from London

44:22.641 --> 44:24.442
to see my mother before she-

44:24.443 --> 44:26.078
What?

44:26.079 --> 44:28.881
Oh yes, yes.

44:28.981 --> 44:30.515
I couldn't let her um,

44:30.516 --> 44:33.451
depart without seeing her one last time.

44:33.452 --> 44:34.419
<i>Your mother and I have</i>

44:34.420 --> 44:37.055
a lot more in common
than you girls realize.

44:37.056 --> 44:38.256
So many memories.

44:38.257 --> 44:40.591
And I'm staying here
right till the very end.

44:45.231 --> 44:46.732
Sofa's fine.

44:46.733 --> 44:48.100
Well, I'm not sleeping with her.

44:48.101 --> 44:50.201
I've slept in all kinds of places.

44:50.202 --> 44:52.236
Oh, I'm sure you have, Tamara!

44:52.237 --> 44:54.138
Though not in a hotel, apparently.

44:54.139 --> 44:55.741
I like being right in the middle of things,

44:55.742 --> 44:57.075
where I can see everything,

44:57.076 --> 45:00.078
and hear any noises up above.

45:03.215 --> 45:05.885
Maybe I should go to a hotel.

45:39.452 --> 45:42.188
Oh hi, you're awake.

45:42.422 --> 45:45.091
I was just having a look around.

45:45.157 --> 45:46.959
Nice place.

45:48.193 --> 45:49.995
Do you own it?

45:50.396 --> 45:52.198
Yes.

45:52.798 --> 45:55.200
Well, I see you put
Richard right next door.

45:55.201 --> 45:58.004
It's just because it's Kaitlyn's old room.

45:59.204 --> 46:01.339
Are you really dying?

46:02.307 --> 46:03.707
It's possible.

46:03.708 --> 46:05.276
It's always possible, darling.

46:05.277 --> 46:08.080
I'm not a well women myself.

46:08.081 --> 46:09.680
The doctor said to get ready.

46:09.681 --> 46:11.149
Ready for what?

46:11.150 --> 46:12.817
Oh god.

46:12.818 --> 46:15.153
Oh god to die, sorry.

46:15.221 --> 46:16.488
<i>Yes.</i>

46:16.489 --> 46:18.489
That's not good when they say that, is it?

46:18.490 --> 46:20.292
No.

46:22.427 --> 46:24.229
It's nice.

46:26.298 --> 46:27.431
You happy with what's-his-name?

46:27.432 --> 46:28.433
Ted.

46:28.434 --> 46:30.236
Tom.

46:30.302 --> 46:32.238
Of course we're happy.

46:32.737 --> 46:35.407
Well, I don't know what is happy.

46:36.242 --> 46:37.375
Okay, so it's just a marriage like

46:37.376 --> 46:38.642
other people's marriages.

46:38.643 --> 46:39.710
No, I wouldn't say that.

46:39.711 --> 46:40.745
He's a good man.

46:40.746 --> 46:42.548
Is he?

46:42.949 --> 46:46.218
Yeah, well, it can be enough
in a man at our age, can it?

46:46.219 --> 46:47.285
<i>How did you meet?</i>

46:47.286 --> 46:49.254
I really don't want to go
into all that right now.

46:49.255 --> 46:50.388
Oh come on, Grace, please.

46:50.389 --> 46:51.756
I'm interested.

46:51.757 --> 46:53.191
Okay, if you really want to know.

46:53.192 --> 46:54.392
I do.

46:54.393 --> 46:57.129
My husband was shacked
up with another woman.

46:57.130 --> 46:59.531
And I was at a grocery store
and I couldn't stop crying,

46:59.532 --> 47:01.198
<i>'cause I had hardly any money,</i>

47:01.199 --> 47:02.868
<i>and the groceries were
really heavy and my baby</i>

47:02.869 --> 47:04.602
wouldn't stop screaming.

47:04.603 --> 47:07.738
<i>And this really nice
man helped me home.</i>

47:07.739 --> 47:10.341
<i>And the next day he
turned up with his toolbox</i>

47:10.342 --> 47:13.345
to fix a window that I
didn't even know was cracked.

47:13.346 --> 47:16.015
Always love a man with a toolbox.

47:16.748 --> 47:19.350
It was a horrible
winter, as you may recall,

47:19.351 --> 47:21.287
in so many ways.

47:21.653 --> 47:23.221
Ah.

47:23.222 --> 47:25.157
So one night,

47:25.358 --> 47:27.759
you drank too much wine,

47:27.760 --> 47:29.261
slept with a nice toolbox man,

47:29.262 --> 47:30.794
and ended up pregnant.

47:30.795 --> 47:32.396
Now wait-

47:34.500 --> 47:35.767
I didn't know what he was gonna say,

47:35.768 --> 47:37.234
we hardly knew each other.

47:37.235 --> 47:38.203
Yeah, well,

47:38.204 --> 47:40.538
that's always an awkward
situation, isn't it?

47:40.539 --> 47:42.908
Yeah, but he was ecstatic.

47:43.409 --> 47:46.277
Really wanted to be a dad, and to Zoe, too

47:46.278 --> 47:48.080
And Richard-

47:48.514 --> 47:50.681
Yeah, well, Richard was away with you.

47:50.682 --> 47:53.785
Screaming and fucking and
throwing shoes at each other.

47:53.786 --> 47:55.287
<i>So you know,</i>

47:55.288 --> 47:57.455
maybe you were the lucky one.

47:57.523 --> 47:59.658
<i>Maybe except the brain
tumour thing, you know.</i>

47:59.659 --> 48:01.792
<i>Yeah, maybe even that, Grace.</i>

48:01.793 --> 48:04.462
It's not like getting
old is any fun, is it?

48:04.463 --> 48:07.133
<i>Particularly in the
circles I move in.</i>

48:07.432 --> 48:09.533
<i>Men buzz around you like flies.</i>

48:09.534 --> 48:10.368
Next thing you know,

48:10.369 --> 48:11.937
they're chatting
up some 19-year-old

48:11.938 --> 48:14.406
and you're on the corner drinking alone.

48:14.407 --> 48:15.573
<i>I tell you what.</i>

48:15.574 --> 48:17.875
It's been so nice having Zoe for company

48:17.876 --> 48:19.678
while she tried out that new job.

48:19.679 --> 48:21.479
You've been a fantastic stepmother,

48:21.480 --> 48:23.448
and I really appreciate that.

48:23.449 --> 48:24.982
If you ask me, they should
never have fired her.

48:24.983 --> 48:26.451
<i>If they didn't have security cameras</i>

48:26.452 --> 48:28.453
they'd never even known
she'd had sex on a desk.

48:28.454 --> 48:29.453
What?!

48:29.454 --> 48:30.988
Oh god.

48:30.989 --> 48:32.992
I mean, honestly.

48:33.358 --> 48:34.993
Who wants to live in a world
where you can't make love

48:34.994 --> 48:37.997
on your desk if the opportunity arises?

48:40.432 --> 48:42.500
<i>Richard really missed her
when you moved here, you know.</i>

48:42.501 --> 48:44.368
<i>I never wanted a baby of my own.</i>

48:44.369 --> 48:46.638
Who wants to clean up somebody's shit?

48:46.639 --> 48:48.707
<i>Now I wonder, you know,</i>

48:48.708 --> 48:51.442
who's gonna clean up my shit when I'm old?

48:51.443 --> 48:52.611
<i>Maybe that's why people have babies.</i>

48:52.612 --> 48:55.414
You clean their shit, they clean yours.

48:56.715 --> 48:58.582
When I was young I used
to think there'd be people

48:58.583 --> 49:01.653
lining up to clean my shit.

49:02.255 --> 49:05.522
That I'd be mourned by
millions when I died.

49:05.523 --> 49:06.524
Millions?

49:06.525 --> 49:08.526
What did you think you'd be?

49:08.527 --> 49:10.328
Princess.

49:10.463 --> 49:12.298
Dictator.

49:13.465 --> 49:15.600
Eva Peron, that was the life.

49:15.601 --> 49:16.734
<i>But, you know, sometimes your dreams</i>

49:16.735 --> 49:18.502
<i>don't come true, do they?</i>

49:18.503 --> 49:20.738
Some people meet Juan Peron

49:20.739 --> 49:22.406
and I meet Richard Feekery.

49:22.407 --> 49:23.741
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

49:23.742 --> 49:24.942
<i>Wife of a Tolstoy
Prize winner is nice,</i>

49:24.943 --> 49:27.879
but you don't get as much as people think.

49:27.880 --> 49:30.281
If only he'd won the Nobel.

49:30.282 --> 49:33.017
Zoe might clean up your
shit when the time comes.

49:33.018 --> 49:35.787
You have given her some seriously nice

49:35.788 --> 49:37.589
<i>birthday presents.</i>

49:40.358 --> 49:42.461
She's easy to love, isn't she?

49:42.795 --> 49:44.763
Not like her father.

49:45.398 --> 49:47.499
Well, he's pretty easy to love, too.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.568
Yes, I remember.

49:49.802 --> 49:51.569
Yes, I bet you do.

49:51.570 --> 49:53.538
I didn't mean it like that.

49:53.539 --> 49:54.538
<i>Listen to me, Grace.</i>

49:54.539 --> 49:56.374
All this shit about you
being his true love is

49:56.375 --> 50:00.178
batshit crazy and I know batshit crazy.

50:00.378 --> 50:01.312
<i>I was his true love,</i>

50:01.313 --> 50:02.913
which is why he left you and Zoe for me.

50:02.914 --> 50:04.415
It's okay we don't live happily ever after,

50:04.416 --> 50:06.584
but, frankly, who does?

50:06.585 --> 50:07.718
So if you want one last fling,

50:07.719 --> 50:08.953
just find somebody else.

50:08.954 --> 50:10.721
I don't want one last fling.

50:10.722 --> 50:12.089
Of course you do.

50:12.090 --> 50:13.758
We all want one last fling.

50:13.759 --> 50:16.428
<i>I want one last fling and
I'm not even dying, so,</i>

50:16.429 --> 50:17.529
I'm not judging you,

50:17.530 --> 50:19.331
I'm just saying,

50:19.398 --> 50:21.665
please, just find a different man.

50:21.666 --> 50:23.802
Hm? What?

50:25.403 --> 50:27.205
What's happening?

50:27.472 --> 50:30.341
Just checking your wife
isn't fucking my husband.

50:31.077 --> 50:32.410
Oh.

50:32.411 --> 50:33.410
Thanks.

50:33.411 --> 50:35.080
Pleasure.

50:35.081 --> 50:36.547
Night.

50:36.548 --> 50:38.350
Yeah, night.

50:41.353 --> 50:43.488
That was nice of her.

52:06.539 --> 52:07.538
Two.

52:07.539 --> 52:09.374
Yeah.

52:09.507 --> 52:11.476
Thanks, Tyler.

52:23.588 --> 52:25.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:27.059 --> 52:28.593
24/7,

52:28.594 --> 52:31.062
walking distance from my house, and

52:31.063 --> 52:34.665
surprisingly good coffee made
by my friend, Tyler, here.

52:34.666 --> 52:37.403
<i>An insomniac's dream.</i>

52:38.670 --> 52:40.638
Did my text wake you?

52:40.840 --> 52:42.674
Uh, yeah.

52:42.675 --> 52:43.642
The ping surprised me.

52:43.643 --> 52:45.877
I can't remember the last time I got a text

52:45.878 --> 52:47.578
in the middle of the night.

52:47.579 --> 52:48.946
Did it wake Terry?

52:48.947 --> 52:50.681
No, I left her a note,

52:50.682 --> 52:53.151
said I had to go into the office.

52:53.152 --> 52:56.955
Something unexpected.

52:57.088 --> 52:58.756
This could have waited till morning.

52:58.757 --> 53:01.426
But you wanted to tell me now.

53:03.094 --> 53:04.896
Okay.

53:05.063 --> 53:08.233
This is gonna sound horribly melodramatic,

53:08.867 --> 53:10.669
but um,

53:12.704 --> 53:14.772
I may be dying.

53:16.574 --> 53:18.977
<i>And I don't mean I may be mortal.</i>

53:18.978 --> 53:20.779
I mean,

53:20.846 --> 53:21.846
on Monday.

53:21.847 --> 53:23.649
Monday?

53:23.782 --> 53:25.584
The blackout?

53:25.784 --> 53:27.584
Yeah.

53:27.585 --> 53:29.020
I felt woozy

53:29.021 --> 53:31.122
a few times, I fell once but,

53:31.123 --> 53:32.857
I just thought that I was

53:32.858 --> 53:35.593
<i>tired and clumsy.</i>

53:35.594 --> 53:39.029
They can't do a biopsy
'cause it's in too deep so

53:39.030 --> 53:40.631
they just have to cut open my skull

53:40.632 --> 53:43.535
<i>and see what they can find.</i>

53:43.536 --> 53:45.671
I might be fine after surgery.

53:46.137 --> 53:49.274
Or I might wake up and

53:49.275 --> 53:51.944
not be myself any-more.

53:52.677 --> 53:55.078
Or I might never wake up.

53:55.079 --> 53:56.281
<i>It's big.</i>

53:56.282 --> 53:58.951
But you might be okay.

53:59.885 --> 54:01.687
Yeah.

54:02.887 --> 54:05.890
But the doctor said to get ready.

54:05.891 --> 54:07.191
Jesus.

54:07.192 --> 54:08.759
Yeah, I don't want pity.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.160
That's why I haven't told people, I

54:10.161 --> 54:12.163
hated it when my first
husband immortalized me

54:12.164 --> 54:15.634
as the pathetic, abandoned wife.

54:18.304 --> 54:20.904
But I want you to know that
my files are all in order.

54:20.905 --> 54:22.205
A few messy odds and ends,

54:22.206 --> 54:23.841
<i>but nothing that you
can't figure out.</i>

54:23.842 --> 54:26.511
I must remember to email you my password.

54:27.179 --> 54:29.481
And the Millwood Project.

54:30.916 --> 54:32.584
Well?

54:32.585 --> 54:35.720
You've seen the model.

54:35.721 --> 54:38.524
It's as good as the clients want it to be.

54:39.791 --> 54:41.859
<i>And as for my shares, well,</i>

54:41.860 --> 54:43.662
I have a will.

54:43.695 --> 54:44.895
It's only 10% of the company.

54:44.896 --> 54:47.265
Don't worry, Tom knows that
they're not worth very much.

54:47.266 --> 54:49.068
Okay.

54:52.938 --> 54:54.740
And...

54:56.275 --> 54:58.077
And?

54:59.010 --> 55:02.080
This is embarrassing but

55:02.815 --> 55:05.484
I think it needs to be said.

55:06.251 --> 55:07.618
You mean-

55:07.619 --> 55:09.754
This means that we'll-

55:12.090 --> 55:13.892
Never...

55:14.126 --> 55:15.928
Never.

55:16.996 --> 55:19.096
There was that time.

55:19.097 --> 55:20.098
We almost.

55:20.099 --> 55:21.098
Just a kiss.

55:21.099 --> 55:22.165
We didn't even do that.

55:22.166 --> 55:24.502
But if we had.

55:24.902 --> 55:26.837
Might not have stopped with a kiss.

55:26.838 --> 55:29.508
Maybe that's why we didn't.

55:29.842 --> 55:30.875
Kiss.

55:30.876 --> 55:32.678
Who knows?

55:32.777 --> 55:33.910
Who knows?

55:33.911 --> 55:35.846
But if we both-

55:35.847 --> 55:37.381
Weren't married.

55:37.382 --> 55:39.385
Maybe.

55:39.918 --> 55:41.720
Yeah.

55:45.858 --> 55:48.560
And if we did it now?

55:53.164 --> 55:54.899
That would just be

55:54.900 --> 55:56.767
damaging your marriage for no reason

55:56.768 --> 55:58.435
and we're not gonna do that.

55:58.436 --> 56:00.606
Other people would.

56:01.039 --> 56:03.008
We're not other people.

56:05.811 --> 56:10.415
Well I'm not sure my
marriage will last, anyway.

56:17.956 --> 56:20.626
I've said all I had to say.

56:23.896 --> 56:24.928
Now you must go home now.

56:24.929 --> 56:28.166
I do not want Terry to worry.

56:33.072 --> 56:35.874
Let me drive you home.

56:49.855 --> 56:53.591
Doesn't look like a genius to me.

57:23.422 --> 57:25.756
Did you sleep with him?

57:25.824 --> 57:27.792
None of your business.

57:27.893 --> 57:29.761
You're right.

57:31.829 --> 57:33.832
But I didn't,

57:34.500 --> 57:37.169
because I'm not that kind of girl.

57:40.972 --> 57:43.075
My sweet Gracie.

57:46.010 --> 57:48.680
How will I live without you?

58:18.210 --> 58:20.812
"Oh, you are a wise man, are you not?

58:20.813 --> 58:23.013
You know all about life and death.

58:23.014 --> 58:25.015
Advise me. Think what I can do."

58:25.016 --> 58:26.818
Morning.

58:27.018 --> 58:28.118
Hi.

58:28.119 --> 58:31.088
I-I vowed to myself that
I'd finish Middlemarch bef-

58:31.190 --> 58:34.192
Oh, darling, maybe you're
a little optimistic.

58:34.193 --> 58:36.562
<i>So there's always your next life.</i>

58:36.929 --> 58:39.097
Do you believe in reincarnation?

58:40.298 --> 58:42.100
I don't know.

58:43.101 --> 58:45.771
It's a huge question, isn't it?

58:46.972 --> 58:49.040
What happens next? Is it-

58:49.041 --> 58:51.843
Is it nothingness? Is it something?

58:52.610 --> 58:55.846
But without our bodies
do you think we're really,

58:55.847 --> 58:57.783
truly ourselves?

58:58.349 --> 59:01.084
<i>Or is the concept of
an afterlife just a lie</i>

59:01.085 --> 59:02.453
in order to avoid the

59:02.454 --> 59:05.123
terror of obliteration?

59:06.324 --> 59:08.326
I've always felt I was Cleopatra.

59:08.327 --> 59:10.262
Of course you did.

59:10.628 --> 59:12.062
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

59:12.063 --> 59:13.230
- This is him.
- Who?

59:13.231 --> 59:14.631
My true love.

59:14.632 --> 59:15.966
Oh, yes, yes.

59:15.967 --> 59:17.334
He's cute.

59:17.335 --> 59:18.368
- Very cute.
- Yes, very cute.

59:18.369 --> 59:20.004
What's he like in bed?

59:20.005 --> 59:20.837
It doesn't say.

59:20.838 --> 59:22.138
What do you mean what doesn't say?

59:22.139 --> 59:23.941
The dating website.

59:24.208 --> 59:27.477
But, he has very liberal views

59:27.478 --> 59:29.780
and he loves dogs.

59:30.114 --> 59:32.783
<i>Oh, he also likes horror movies.</i>

59:33.952 --> 59:37.154
Mum, I have 238 potential matches.

59:37.155 --> 59:39.991
You don't have to find
your true love today.

59:39.992 --> 59:41.625
<i>I know, but Kaitlyn already has.</i>

59:41.626 --> 59:44.127
And honestly guys have always
liked me more than Kaitlyn.

59:44.128 --> 59:45.363
Well, I thought she was a lesbian.

59:45.364 --> 59:46.363
I know.

59:46.364 --> 59:49.399
No, sadly, neither of my
daughters are lesbians.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.636
Oh, I couldn't live without penises.

59:51.637 --> 59:52.970
<i>Have they got any men my age?</i>

59:52.971 --> 59:53.837
- Yes.
- No, no, no, actually,

59:53.838 --> 59:55.006
don't look, it'll be too depressing.

59:55.007 --> 59:56.573
They all want girls your age.

59:56.574 --> 59:58.241
Zoe, take my advice.

59:58.242 --> 01:00:01.279
Find a good man when
you're young, hold on tight.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.314
If he bores you later, just
fuck someone on the side.

01:00:04.315 --> 01:00:06.417
<i>Zoe, darling, I'm going
to go meet Kaitlyn's</i>

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:08.920
alleged true love.

01:00:12.123 --> 01:00:13.390
Let's meet later for a cup of coffee

01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:15.026
to discuss your future.

01:00:15.027 --> 01:00:16.060
Just-just you and me, okay?

01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:17.560
- Okay.
- Sweetheart.

01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:19.363
Bye.

01:00:20.132 --> 01:00:22.100
Oh, he's cute!

01:00:24.036 --> 01:00:25.468
Okay, I'm gonna have breakfast with Kaitlyn

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:27.004
<i>and then some coffee with Zoe.</i>

01:00:27.005 --> 01:00:28.205
I'll be back by lunch.

01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:30.341
Don't worry, I'll bring something-

01:00:31.043 --> 01:00:32.042
Yeah, wrong husband.

01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:33.209
I have
- Darling, I'm sorry.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.678
Sorry, sorry.

01:00:34.679 --> 01:00:35.680
Zoe's just told
me that you check into

01:00:35.681 --> 01:00:37.047
the hospital tomorrow.

01:00:37.048 --> 01:00:38.149
<i>Yeah, at four.</i>

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:39.683
Ah, so, what time do they operate?

01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:41.151
First thing Monday morning.

01:00:41.152 --> 01:00:42.319
So tonight's your uh,

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.620
last night to do uh,

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:45.422
whatever it is you want to do.

01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:47.225
Yes.

01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:49.227
Yes, it is.

01:00:56.568 --> 01:00:58.437
Yes, it is.

01:01:04.076 --> 01:01:05.877
Thank you.

01:01:05.978 --> 01:01:07.779
Thanks.

01:01:08.213 --> 01:01:09.346
He's late.

01:01:09.347 --> 01:01:11.114
Maybe I should call him.

01:01:11.115 --> 01:01:12.350
He's always turning his cellphone off.

01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:13.984
He says it makes it too hard for him

01:01:13.985 --> 01:01:16.220
to concentrate on his writing.

01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:19.189
Why don't you expand
your research into a book?

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.125
<i>Then people will read you
even after you're dead</i>

01:01:21.126 --> 01:01:23.259
<i>and you'll be
immortalized as yourself</i>

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.932
rather than as the lies that
other people write about you.

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:29.066
I'm just so in love with him.

01:01:29.067 --> 01:01:30.201
It's like I'm brain dead,

01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:31.768
but in a good way.

01:01:31.769 --> 01:01:33.104
<i>Like, you know,</i>

01:01:33.105 --> 01:01:34.939
<i>how you used to feel for Dad.</i>

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:38.009
And you can travel.

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.076
<i>You and Zoe could
go to Machu Picchu.</i>

01:01:39.077 --> 01:01:41.012
Please, Kaitlyn, you-

01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:42.914
There he is!

01:01:43.114 --> 01:01:45.082
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:01:45.217 --> 01:01:48.754
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

01:01:50.155 --> 01:01:52.958
So you're the slut who's
sleeping with my husband!

01:01:55.226 --> 01:01:56.359
She's old enough to suck your dick,

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.129
she's old enough to meet your wife!

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.562
Kaitlyn's mum, I presume.

01:01:59.563 --> 01:02:00.497
Pleased to meet you, both.

01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:02.232
What, your little whore isn't allowed out

01:02:02.233 --> 01:02:03.767
- without a grown-up?
- Darla, don't-

01:02:03.768 --> 01:02:06.370
I swear, Mum, I didn't know he was married.

01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:07.370
I didn't know.

01:02:07.371 --> 01:02:08.705
So you're not just a slut,

01:02:08.706 --> 01:02:10.241
you're a stupid slut.

01:02:10.242 --> 01:02:11.609
I was going to tell you,

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:12.642
<i>then everything just
kept happening so fast,</i>

01:02:12.643 --> 01:02:13.777
especially with the news.

01:02:13.778 --> 01:02:14.779
What news?

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.779
Her mother is dying.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.381
- You're dying?
- Possibly.

01:02:17.382 --> 01:02:18.381
Kaitlyn told me probably.

01:02:18.382 --> 01:02:19.383
It is probably.

01:02:19.384 --> 01:02:20.551
Your mother says possibly.

01:02:20.552 --> 01:02:21.651
She's in denial.

01:02:21.652 --> 01:02:23.053
I'm not in denial.

01:02:23.054 --> 01:02:24.522
She's in denial about being in denial.

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:25.489
Kaitlyn told me probably,

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.290
she said she wanted her mother to meet me

01:02:27.291 --> 01:02:29.060
<i>before she died, said
it was really important.</i>

01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:32.395
<i>So I didn't think it
was a good time to say</i>

01:02:32.396 --> 01:02:33.596
that I was married.

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:36.133
It is not my husband's job
to make your mom's dying wish

01:02:36.134 --> 01:02:38.835
<i>to see her loser daughter
find a man come true.</i>

01:02:38.836 --> 01:02:39.971
I never said that.

01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:42.272
I actually would have
preferred her to meet a woman.

01:02:42.273 --> 01:02:43.441
It wasn't even like that.

01:02:43.442 --> 01:02:46.176
Will told me I was his soul-mate.

01:02:46.177 --> 01:02:48.412
He was just trying to fuck you, you idiot.

01:02:48.413 --> 01:02:49.613
Have you taught her nothing?

01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:50.848
It wasn't just about-

01:02:50.849 --> 01:02:52.850
I-I thought
that-

01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:56.453
She's Richard Feekery's step-daughter.

01:02:56.454 --> 01:02:58.421
<i>The man is a God-damn genius, okay?</i>

01:02:58.422 --> 01:03:00.591
No, no, he's my half-sister's father.

01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:02.692
He's not my step-father, it's different.

01:03:02.693 --> 01:03:05.296
But I didn't think I would
have to decide so fast

01:03:05.297 --> 01:03:07.798
and that suddenly she's dying, and then-

01:03:09.101 --> 01:03:10.734
<i>What about that guy from the gym?</i>

01:03:10.735 --> 01:03:12.502
This is not about the guy from the gym.

01:03:12.503 --> 01:03:15.238
Oh, okay, so you could just
sleep with whoever you want-

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:16.239
Kaitlyn, I think we should leave.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.243
Nice to meet you both.

01:03:18.476 --> 01:03:19.477
Kaitlyn.

01:03:19.478 --> 01:03:20.577
<i>Kaitlyn, come on.</i>

01:03:25.382 --> 01:03:28.218
This is why I don't date.

01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:30.354
I thought it went really well.

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:31.254
Really?

01:03:31.255 --> 01:03:33.189
Yes, it could have been so much worse.

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.192
I nearly ripped Tamara's face off.

01:03:36.193 --> 01:03:38.629
That chapter in Dad's book was true?

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.432
Yeah.

01:03:43.367 --> 01:03:44.368
I thought we were

01:03:44.369 --> 01:03:47.738
Dante and Beatrice and
we were just a tweet.

01:03:47.739 --> 01:03:49.739
Oh my god, there's so
much I haven't taught you.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.408
That hysterical young woman was right.

01:03:52.409 --> 01:03:55.346
Never trust a man who
won't spend the night.

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:58.016
<i>You know, you are both so young.</i>

01:03:58.483 --> 01:04:00.283
<i>You're gonna make many mistakes</i>

01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:01.886
<i>which you can't even imagine,</i>

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:03.921
but it will all settle down, I promise.

01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:05.355
When?

01:04:05.356 --> 01:04:06.357
When do you find the job

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:08.359
that you're gonna love
more than any other job?

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.493
And the man that we love
more than any other man?

01:04:10.494 --> 01:04:11.761
Or woman.

01:04:11.762 --> 01:04:13.397
That's not happening, Mum.

01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:15.200
We have to let it go.

01:04:15.266 --> 01:04:16.901
God, I had such a crappy job.

01:04:16.902 --> 01:04:18.902
But I used to walk past
this beautiful building

01:04:18.903 --> 01:04:21.305
and it just made me happy to see it.

01:04:21.306 --> 01:04:23.374
Sort of made my day light.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.910
And one day I said to myself,

01:04:25.911 --> 01:04:28.312
I'm gonna become an architect.

01:04:28.313 --> 01:04:31.116
I am gonna build beautiful buildings.

01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:34.452
That's nice.

01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:37.455
Why didn't you do it?

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:40.790
Why-why-why
didn't I do what?

01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:43.660
Build beautiful buildings
instead of subdivisions?

01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:45.328
Zoe.

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:47.397
No, it's alright.

01:04:47.398 --> 01:04:48.966
You can ask me anything you want.

01:04:48.967 --> 01:04:50.969
<i>Um...</i>

01:04:52.737 --> 01:04:55.406
You know, I don't think I was good enough.

01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.209
Did you try?

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.211
<i>Of course I tried.</i>

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.216
But maybe not hard enough.

01:05:05.217 --> 01:05:06.549
Why not?

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:09.285
Well, I wanted you to be
well into your thirties

01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:11.421
before I disillusioned you but

01:05:11.422 --> 01:05:12.823
I suppose it takes me having a brain tumour

01:05:12.824 --> 01:05:14.758
for you to actually want my advice.

01:05:14.759 --> 01:05:15.993
That's actually true.

01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:18.663
<i>So what have I learnt from my life?</i>

01:05:18.896 --> 01:05:20.698
Um...

01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:24.701
Most of us get tired of
having wild love affairs

01:05:24.702 --> 01:05:26.736
full of screaming and
pain and getting fired

01:05:26.737 --> 01:05:29.406
because we had sex on the desk.

01:05:32.344 --> 01:05:33.776
We want to grow up,

01:05:33.777 --> 01:05:35.379
<i>construct a life.</i>

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.779
<i>So we have to put
ourselves in a box.</i>

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.381
We have to choose a career.

01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:39.850
We have to commit ourselves
to one relationship

01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:41.653
<i>rather than another.</i>

01:05:42.621 --> 01:05:44.988
But sometimes we can't fit all ourselves

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:47.357
into the box because people are huge.

01:05:47.358 --> 01:05:48.792
We're-

01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:50.727
we're giants.

01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:55.399
We're full of rage and
joy and passion and...

01:05:56.934 --> 01:05:59.002
Sometimes you start to feel
hunched up all the time,

01:05:59.003 --> 01:06:01.504
like you're in a tiny
little prison cell and,

01:06:01.505 --> 01:06:03.640
and you dream of putting
your fist through the box,

01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:06.343
<i>and you don't want to lose
it all and find that you've</i>

01:06:06.344 --> 01:06:07.611
<i>got no career and no family</i>

01:06:07.612 --> 01:06:11.013
like those stupid people
who never grow up but...

01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:24.028
Maybe the box needn't be quite so small.

01:06:27.532 --> 01:06:31.435
Maybe sometimes we can just stand up and-

01:06:31.436 --> 01:06:33.370
and-and shake our fists and shout.

01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:35.571
<i>And maybe it won't all come down</i>

01:06:35.572 --> 01:06:36.774
if we yell,

01:06:36.775 --> 01:06:39.509
fuck you world, here I am.

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.412
Fuck you world here I am!

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:42.946
Fuck you world here I am!

01:06:42.947 --> 01:06:44.848
Fuck you world

01:06:44.849 --> 01:06:47.051
here I am.

01:07:10.574 --> 01:07:11.575
She's not answering.

01:07:11.576 --> 01:07:12.375
That's odd.

01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:13.710
She said she'd be back for lunch.

01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:15.613
I'm starving.

01:07:15.813 --> 01:07:17.013
Well don't look at me.

01:07:17.014 --> 01:07:17.848
I don't cook.

01:07:17.849 --> 01:07:19.549
Maybe she's run away to Machu Picchu.

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:21.084
Machu Picchu?

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:25.488
It's an ancient Incan city
on a mountain ridge in Peru.

01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:26.723
Gracie wanted to go there.

01:07:26.724 --> 01:07:28.591
This idiot took her to Disneyland.

01:07:28.592 --> 01:07:30.593
Yeah, we had the time of
our lives in Disneyland,

01:07:30.594 --> 01:07:33.397
and I lost three pounds.

01:07:34.032 --> 01:07:35.732
<i>No, no, she's probably,</i>

01:07:35.733 --> 01:07:37.701
<i>you know, just having a nice
last day with the girls.</i>

01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:39.671
Yeah, let's hope so.

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:42.172
What does that mean?

01:07:42.173 --> 01:07:44.107
He's worried her last fuck
will be with someone else,

01:07:44.108 --> 01:07:45.009
aren't you, sweetie?

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:46.642
I've got first dibs on the last fuck.

01:07:46.643 --> 01:07:48.444
Ah, I'm going out.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:52.383
Do you have an appointment
to meet her somewhere?

01:07:52.449 --> 01:07:53.917
No.

01:07:53.918 --> 01:07:56.453
Okay, well, you can go then.

01:07:56.454 --> 01:07:58.323
Oh, thanks.

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:01.859
Do you know what I want?

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.828
A nice glass of wine.

01:08:04.661 --> 01:08:05.995
We don't keep alcohol in the house.

01:08:05.996 --> 01:08:07.497
Oh don't you worry about that, my darling,

01:08:07.498 --> 01:08:09.066
I'm a resourceful woman.

01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:11.870
It's never hard for a woman
like me to find a drink.

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:27.050
Married men should be required by law

01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.618
to wear wedding rings.

01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:31.522
Mum loves beautiful buildings,

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:34.559
so she became an architect.

01:08:35.658 --> 01:08:38.328
What do I like most?

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.698
Sex.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.568
You don't want to think
of that as a profession.

01:08:51.576 --> 01:08:52.576
<i>What?</i>

01:08:52.577 --> 01:08:53.844
Hey, is your mother here?

01:08:53.845 --> 01:08:54.844
No.

01:08:54.845 --> 01:08:56.112
Do you know where she is?

01:08:56.113 --> 01:08:57.714
<i>Why would I tell you?</i>

01:08:57.715 --> 01:08:58.948
<i>You're trying to steal
her away from my father.</i>

01:08:58.948 --> 01:09:00.917
She has a point, Dad.

01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:03.519
Yeah, alright, I shouldn't ask you.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.488
Zoe, where's your mother?

01:09:06.157 --> 01:09:08.090
<i>Come on, your loyalty
should be to your father.</i>

01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:10.059
But Tom did buy me my IPhone,

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.228
and he took me to the
hospital that one time

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:13.662
<i>when I fell off my pony,</i>

01:09:13.663 --> 01:09:15.131
and he was so encouraging when I told him

01:09:15.131 --> 01:09:16.532
<i>that I wanted to go on safari,</i>

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:19.203
- <i>and I just...</i>
- Ah, for fuck's sake.

01:09:20.872 --> 01:09:22.572
Popcorn.

01:09:22.573 --> 01:09:23.607
I'm starving.

01:09:23.608 --> 01:09:24.942
Don't look at us, we don't cook.

01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:25.943
I cook.

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:26.943
He is a great cook.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:27.944
I am a good cook.

01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:28.946
What do you want?

01:09:28.947 --> 01:09:30.081
What are you guys doing?

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.948
We're trying to figure out
what to do with our lives

01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:34.618
in case mum isn't around to help us decide.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:36.620
Alright, well,

01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:39.288
let's start with an omelette.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.870
I always thought Gracie
and I would get back together.

01:09:52.871 --> 01:09:54.838
Maybe at Zoe's wedding.

01:09:56.006 --> 01:09:58.242
<i>She'd look up as I walked
our daughter down the aisle,</i>

01:09:58.243 --> 01:10:00.644
and we'd kind of just

01:10:00.645 --> 01:10:01.745
fall into each other's arms.

01:10:01.746 --> 01:10:03.145
At my wedding?

01:10:03.146 --> 01:10:03.947
Well, that's the great thing

01:10:03.948 --> 01:10:05.715
about having a kid with someone.

01:10:05.716 --> 01:10:07.584
You never completely lose touch with them.

01:10:07.585 --> 01:10:09.252
Mum said that that was the worst thing

01:10:09.253 --> 01:10:10.533
about having a kid with someone.

01:10:11.256 --> 01:10:12.755
Oh, I have a text.

01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.559
Is that your mother?

01:10:14.759 --> 01:10:16.561
- Oh.
- What?

01:10:16.793 --> 01:10:18.596
It's from Will.

01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:19.630
Who's Will?

01:10:19.631 --> 01:10:21.297
Does he-does he drive a black Land Rover?

01:10:21.298 --> 01:10:23.000
Will is Kaitlyn's married boyfriend

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:25.935
whose wife called her
a whore in front of Mum.

01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:27.036
So awkward.

01:10:27.037 --> 01:10:28.604
<i>What did he say?</i>

01:10:28.605 --> 01:10:30.273
"Can I C U?

01:10:30.274 --> 01:10:31.875
Told D leaving,

01:10:31.876 --> 01:10:35.546
U R T R L V!"

01:10:35.546 --> 01:10:37.880
What a cryptic means of communication.

01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:38.881
Oh Dad, it's texting.

01:10:38.882 --> 01:10:40.216
Come on, everybody does it.

01:10:40.217 --> 01:10:41.751
Well, I don't.

01:10:41.752 --> 01:10:43.286
A dog communicates with more elegance.

01:10:43.287 --> 01:10:44.821
Alright, go on then, translate.

01:10:44.822 --> 01:10:46.290
Okay.

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.759
Will told D, his wife

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760
D stands for wife?

01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:51.562
Her name is Darla.

01:10:51.929 --> 01:10:53.897
What's the point of a code
if it's that easy to break?

01:10:53.898 --> 01:10:55.933
Will told his wife that he's leaving her

01:10:55.934 --> 01:10:58.769
because Kaitlyn is his true love.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.770
Maybe he really does love me,

01:11:00.771 --> 01:11:04.574
maybe all that's happened
has just been a bumpy start,

01:11:04.908 --> 01:11:06.710
that would be so much better than a

01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:09.246
soul-destroying affair with
a lying creep that could

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:12.049
destroy my self-esteem forever.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.785
- What should I do?
- Okay-

01:11:14.786 --> 01:11:15.818
No, that was a rhetorical question.

01:11:15.819 --> 01:11:17.653
No, I've got your answer to it.

01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:19.055
There's no way you should be giving a guy

01:11:19.056 --> 01:11:21.024
like that a second chance.

01:11:21.225 --> 01:11:24.028
You told me to forgive him! Remember?

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:29.800
He lives here? Number two?

01:11:29.801 --> 01:11:32.234
Yeah, although he never invited me over.

01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:33.269
Now I know why.

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.804
Maybe we should just leave.

01:11:34.805 --> 01:11:36.206
Well, since we have established

01:11:36.207 --> 01:11:37.340
that he doesn't always tell the truth,

01:11:37.341 --> 01:11:38.841
we need to determine the facts

01:11:38.842 --> 01:11:40.077
before I can finalize my advice.

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:41.711
Yeah, I really don't like advice.

01:11:41.712 --> 01:11:42.712
You need advice.

01:11:42.713 --> 01:11:43.880
Even if I wanted advice,

01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:46.082
I wouldn't ask my mother's ex-husband.

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.350
If the only parental figure in your life

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:48.852
is gonna be Tom-

01:11:48.853 --> 01:11:51.521
Mum always said that Tom was the sane one.

01:11:52.023 --> 01:11:54.090
I've changed!

01:11:54.091 --> 01:11:55.492
Why does nobody believe that?

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.099
Is this D?

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.099
Oh my god!

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.100
You're Richard Feekery!

01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:05.135
We're here to see W

01:12:05.136 --> 01:12:06.769
and I don't mean the
incompetent ex-president,

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:07.770
I'm talking about your current husband.

01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:09.640
<i>Will. Will!</i>

01:12:09.774 --> 01:12:11.140
I love your books.

01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:12.274
Thank you!

01:12:12.275 --> 01:12:13.376
- <i>I quite like her.</i>
- Shut up.

01:12:13.377 --> 01:12:15.112
Hi... Lyn.

01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:16.179
Hi. Hi!

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.782
Alright, I used to be a
lying married shit myself,

01:12:18.783 --> 01:12:20.117
so let's not play games, okay?

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.318
<i>Haven't got around
to telling your wife</i>

01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:23.521
you're in love with someone else.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.054
Well, we've all been there.

01:12:25.055 --> 01:12:26.857
<i>But bringing your wife
along to meet your</i>

01:12:26.858 --> 01:12:27.992
future mother-in-law
who's dying,

01:12:27.993 --> 01:12:30.727
I'm sorry, but that's
crossing the line, even for me.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:32.862
But, thanks to a flippant remark I made

01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:34.930
while thinking of no one but myself,

01:12:34.931 --> 01:12:37.934
this sweet, wonderful,

01:12:37.935 --> 01:12:39.935
stubborn young woman is hoping that one day

01:12:39.936 --> 01:12:41.772
this will be a look
back and laugh anecdote.

01:12:41.773 --> 01:12:43.172
<i>Which brings us to this.</i>

01:12:43.173 --> 01:12:46.076
<i>Are you really planing
on leaving your wife?</i>

01:12:46.077 --> 01:12:48.278
And I mean in the packing
and seeing a lawyer sense,

01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:50.846
not in the daydreaming
while you're horny sense.

01:12:51.882 --> 01:12:53.684
I um...

01:12:54.886 --> 01:12:56.286
He lied to me again.

01:12:56.287 --> 01:12:58.054
I am so stupid!

01:12:58.055 --> 01:13:01.725
Don't let this schmuck see
that you're upset, alright?

01:13:01.926 --> 01:13:03.460
Show D the insincere
letters of the alphabet.

01:13:03.461 --> 01:13:05.761
That woman who loves my books should know

01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:07.430
what kind of man she's married to.

01:13:07.431 --> 01:13:09.933
<i>You were gonna spend
your entire life</i>

01:13:09.934 --> 01:13:11.367
<i>regretting this.</i>

01:13:11.368 --> 01:13:12.803
You bastard!

01:13:12.804 --> 01:13:15.173
Trust me, I know.

01:13:15.907 --> 01:13:17.040
Come on, girls.

01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:18.976
Let's get out of here.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:21.178
<i>And D, can I give you some advice?</i>

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:22.778
- Do you take advice?
- Yes, please.

01:13:22.779 --> 01:13:24.214
Advice from Richard Feekery!

01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:25.982
<i>See, someone who takes advice.</i>

01:13:25.983 --> 01:13:28.452
D, you have lovely eyes.

01:13:28.453 --> 01:13:29.920
<i>There are better
men than W who would</i>

01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:32.322
just die for a woman with eyes like yours.

01:13:32.323 --> 01:13:33.857
<i>That's my advice.</i>

01:13:33.858 --> 01:13:35.660
Good day.

01:13:38.796 --> 01:13:40.796
<i>I knew I should have done
more active parenting.</i>

01:13:40.797 --> 01:13:42.866
<i>Your mother never thought
I'd be any good at it.</i>

01:13:42.867 --> 01:13:44.835
If I was that wrong about him,

01:13:44.836 --> 01:13:47.837
how am I ever gonna be sure
I've found my real true love?

01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:49.806
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.075
I used to think I loved
Tamara more than your mother.

01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:53.876
I even wrote a whole book about it.

01:13:53.877 --> 01:13:55.978
Kenny Slitzer is way cuter than he is.

01:13:55.979 --> 01:13:56.979
Just saying.

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.980
Who?

01:13:57.981 --> 01:13:59.381
The first guy she ever kissed.

01:13:59.382 --> 01:14:00.951
I think he may be my true love.

01:14:00.952 --> 01:14:03.086
Hasn't seen him since she was 14.

01:14:03.087 --> 01:14:04.955
Kaitlyn, I never forgot about him.

01:14:04.956 --> 01:14:06.857
He could be your true love.

01:14:06.858 --> 01:14:08.524
No, come on, Kaitlyn, he could be.

01:14:08.525 --> 01:14:10.528
I mean, it's like

01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:12.094
I can't stop thinking about
your mother even though

01:14:12.095 --> 01:14:13.897
I've had loads of women.

01:14:13.898 --> 01:14:14.898
Ugh!

01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:16.099
Well it's kind of easy for a

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.234
Tolstoy Prize winning author to get laid.

01:14:18.235 --> 01:14:19.536
I just befriended him online.

01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:20.536
Do you guys want to see?

01:14:20.537 --> 01:14:22.839
- Sure, darling.
- He's so cute.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.907
Aw, yeah, he's adorable.

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.175
You should send him one of those little

01:14:26.176 --> 01:14:28.178
alphabetical messages.

01:14:31.515 --> 01:14:33.250
You borrowed booze
off the neighbours.

01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:34.518
I would never have thought of that.

01:14:34.519 --> 01:14:37.120
Well, it's a friendly
neighbourhood, isn't it?

01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:39.255
<i>I thought Toronto
would be really boring.</i>

01:14:39.256 --> 01:14:41.925
It's actually rather nice, isn't it?

01:14:42.793 --> 01:14:43.993
Yeah.

01:14:43.994 --> 01:14:46.062
I didn't like it at first um,

01:14:46.063 --> 01:14:47.898
Grace is the one who wanted to move here.

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:49.566
<i>But uh,</i>

01:14:49.567 --> 01:14:50.567
it grows on you.

01:14:50.568 --> 01:14:53.236
And the Canadians, they're...

01:14:54.005 --> 01:14:55.404
They're really polite.

01:14:55.405 --> 01:14:57.040
I love this house.

01:14:57.041 --> 01:14:58.073
Oh yeah, we fixed it up.

01:14:58.074 --> 01:15:00.443
Well, Grace.

01:15:00.444 --> 01:15:01.877
Grace fixed it up.

01:15:01.878 --> 01:15:04.548
Will you stay here afterwards?

01:15:05.015 --> 01:15:06.816
Uh...

01:15:07.051 --> 01:15:08.285
I don't know.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:10.887
It's big for one.

01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:12.823
Yeah.

01:15:12.989 --> 01:15:15.024
I wonder if Kaitlyn would move in with me.

01:15:15.025 --> 01:15:16.559
No, no, no, you can't ask Kaitlyn,

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.361
that's not fair.

01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:20.231
She's got her own life to live.

01:15:21.064 --> 01:15:22.032
Yeah, it's

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:24.968
hard to imagine the
rest of one's life alone.

01:15:24.969 --> 01:15:26.068
What?

01:15:26.069 --> 01:15:27.903
<i>Beautiful man like you.</i>

01:15:27.904 --> 01:15:29.939
Good job, nice house.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.908
What is it you do again?

01:15:32.042 --> 01:15:33.577
I teach uh,

01:15:33.578 --> 01:15:35.111
at a

01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:37.313
community college.

01:15:37.314 --> 01:15:39.849
An intellectual.

01:15:40.117 --> 01:15:43.754
Computer repair and maintenance.

01:15:44.255 --> 01:15:46.923
Oh, have to beat them off with a stick.

01:15:50.627 --> 01:15:52.062
That's really

01:15:52.063 --> 01:15:53.096
not how I see myself.

01:15:53.097 --> 01:15:55.965
Well, we never see
ourselves accurately, do we?

01:15:55.966 --> 01:15:57.500
I mean, what's accurate?

01:15:57.501 --> 01:15:59.135
The way other people see us or

01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:01.806
the monster staring
back at us in the mirror?

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:03.072
Mum comes here when she can't sleep

01:16:03.073 --> 01:16:04.506
'cause it's open all night.

01:16:04.507 --> 01:16:05.608
<i>I know.</i>

01:16:05.609 --> 01:16:06.676
<i>That's why I picked it.</i>

01:16:06.677 --> 01:16:08.879
So that Kenny and I can
tell our children that we

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.350
rekindled our love at their
grandmother's favourite café.

01:16:13.618 --> 01:16:16.086
Shouldn't Zoe meet him alone?

01:16:16.087 --> 01:16:17.086
No.

01:16:17.087 --> 01:16:19.022
He could be a serial killer.

01:16:19.023 --> 01:16:21.157
I mean, he's not gonna put
that on his Facebook, is he?

01:16:21.158 --> 01:16:22.157
Oh my god.

01:16:22.158 --> 01:16:23.961
He's here.

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:26.630
Zoe.

01:16:26.631 --> 01:16:27.997
<i>Kenny, hi.</i>

01:16:27.998 --> 01:16:29.131
Oh, you look great.

01:16:29.132 --> 01:16:31.100
<i>Thank you, so do you.</i>

01:16:31.101 --> 01:16:33.036
Ooh, ten bucks says this is a mistake.

01:16:33.037 --> 01:16:35.005
- You are on.
- You're on.

01:16:35.006 --> 01:16:36.038
- Do you-
- Hey.

01:16:36.039 --> 01:16:38.042
<i>Hi, I'm Richard Feekery.</i>

01:16:38.509 --> 01:16:39.675
<i>You're not a reader, are you?</i>

01:16:39.676 --> 01:16:41.044
Sit down, sit down.

01:16:41.045 --> 01:16:42.978
I'm Zoe's dad and this is-

01:16:42.979 --> 01:16:44.113
I thought your dad was Tom?

01:16:44.114 --> 01:16:45.415
Well, she's got two dads.

01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.651
Welcome to the 21st century, kid.

01:16:47.652 --> 01:16:49.419
What, you want to go
back to my parents' day,

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.022
when married couples had to
live together in misery forever

01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:53.322
<i>because they couldn't get a divorce?</i>

01:16:53.323 --> 01:16:55.524
You think that's a better world?

01:16:55.525 --> 01:16:56.526
No.

01:16:56.527 --> 01:16:57.661
Uh, okay.

01:16:57.662 --> 01:16:59.129
And this is Zoe's sister, Kaitlyn.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:00.130
She's had a tough day.

01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:01.563
Yeah.

01:17:01.564 --> 01:17:02.564
I remember you from school.

01:17:02.565 --> 01:17:04.233
Hm.

01:17:04.234 --> 01:17:06.703
So, go ahead,
guys, get reacquainted.

01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:13.843
Ah-

01:17:14.145 --> 01:17:15.946
Um...

01:17:17.047 --> 01:17:19.148
Alright, you're nervous.

01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:20.282
<i>And you should be,</i>

01:17:20.283 --> 01:17:22.086
this is big stuff.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:25.587
Love, sex, marriage.

01:17:25.588 --> 01:17:27.391
Children.

01:17:28.059 --> 01:17:29.860
Adultery.

01:17:31.061 --> 01:17:32.562
Divorce.

01:17:32.563 --> 01:17:34.363
Loneliness.

01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:36.167
Death.

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:38.468
<i>Throw in a little alcoholism,</i>

01:17:38.469 --> 01:17:40.236
<i>sex addiction.</i>

01:17:40.237 --> 01:17:42.039
<i>Bankruptcy,</i>

01:17:42.073 --> 01:17:43.072
suicidal thoughts,

01:17:43.073 --> 01:17:44.140
regrets so enormous

01:17:44.141 --> 01:17:46.676
you think you're actually
gonna die from the pain.

01:17:48.078 --> 01:17:49.078
But...

01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:50.212
Yeah, but, but

01:17:50.213 --> 01:17:52.182
there's nothing like this.

01:17:53.117 --> 01:17:56.219
<i>That moment when someone
makes your heart skip a beat,</i>

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.054
<i>and you think anything-</i>

01:17:58.055 --> 01:17:59.321
anything is possible.

01:18:09.734 --> 01:18:11.600
Hi, there.

01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:13.937
Got your text.

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:17.374
<i>So, what can I do
for you on this your</i>

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:21.912
possibly almost last
day of your life, Grace?

01:18:22.212 --> 01:18:24.013
You're early.

01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:25.215
I'm not ready yet.

01:18:25.216 --> 01:18:27.151
Can you wait in your office?

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:28.550
Sure.

01:18:28.551 --> 01:18:30.354
I'll call you

01:18:30.755 --> 01:18:32.890
when I want you.

01:18:37.127 --> 01:18:39.429
Do you think that Richard found her?

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.232
Probably.

01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:43.032
Or he'd have come back here

01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:44.367
to see if she came home, wouldn't he?

01:18:44.368 --> 01:18:45.969
Yeah.

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:49.238
I was thinking the same thing myself.

01:18:49.239 --> 01:18:51.040
Mhm.

01:18:53.144 --> 01:18:55.245
If I don't have sex today,

01:18:55.246 --> 01:18:57.514
and Grace dies and

01:18:57.515 --> 01:18:59.381
I don't meet someone
new because I might not,

01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:01.151
you know, lots of people don't,

01:19:01.152 --> 01:19:02.452
and I was never any good at dating,

01:19:02.453 --> 01:19:04.455
even when I was young,

01:19:05.722 --> 01:19:09.591
then that means that my
final fuck ever was like...

01:19:09.592 --> 01:19:11.528
God, I don't even know when it was.

01:19:13.197 --> 01:19:15.999
And I'm not even sure that
I stayed awake until the end.

01:19:16.699 --> 01:19:18.801
And I didn't know it was
my last time ever sex,

01:19:18.802 --> 01:19:21.136
and I really wanted to have
good last time ever sex.

01:19:21.137 --> 01:19:22.138
Something special,

01:19:22.139 --> 01:19:23.139
something memorable.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.139
Is that selfish?

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.175
No, of course not, darling,

01:19:25.176 --> 01:19:26.309
we all want a great fuck.

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:29.278
But Grace won't have sex
with two men on her last day.

01:19:29.279 --> 01:19:30.345
No.

01:19:30.346 --> 01:19:32.348
No woman would do that.

01:19:33.283 --> 01:19:34.818
I would,

01:19:34.819 --> 01:19:37.822
but Gracie's always been
a bit prissy like that.

01:19:39.823 --> 01:19:40.823
Well, just because he found her

01:19:40.824 --> 01:19:42.291
doesn't mean that they-

01:19:42.292 --> 01:19:44.294
You know, maybe they went for a pizza.

01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:46.230
She loves pizza.

01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:47.764
Well I suppose it depends

01:19:47.765 --> 01:19:49.832
on what happened last night, doesn't it?

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:52.367
When they snuck out together.

01:19:52.368 --> 01:19:54.470
You knew about that, of course.

01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:55.705
No.

01:19:55.706 --> 01:19:58.174
Oh, they were tiptoeing in, tiptoeing out.

01:19:58.175 --> 01:19:59.375
I pretended to snore

01:19:59.376 --> 01:20:01.176
so they wouldn't think I could hear them.

01:20:01.177 --> 01:20:02.444
Of course I don't really snore.

01:20:02.445 --> 01:20:05.181
A lady doesn't snore.

01:20:06.783 --> 01:20:08.518
I don't think snoring is gender related,

01:20:08.519 --> 01:20:10.586
I think it's got to do
with septums and palates.

01:20:10.587 --> 01:20:11.854
No, no, no, darling, stay on the topic,

01:20:11.855 --> 01:20:13.456
sweetie, your wife

01:20:13.457 --> 01:20:15.358
and my husband snuck out together.

01:20:15.359 --> 01:20:16.593
Look, have some more wine.

01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:17.626
You've earned it, come on.

01:20:17.627 --> 01:20:19.129
Yeah.

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:20.931
Well,

01:20:21.131 --> 01:20:22.364
maybe she went to the café down the street.

01:20:22.365 --> 01:20:23.765
She goes there sometimes,

01:20:23.766 --> 01:20:25.501
when she has insomnia.

01:20:25.502 --> 01:20:27.469
And then maybe Richard followed her,

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:29.238
and, and then-

01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:31.206
she hit him with her purse and she said,

01:20:31.207 --> 01:20:33.742
"You stay away from me you
brute or I'll kill you!"

01:20:33.743 --> 01:20:34.877
See, lots of things are possible.

01:20:34.878 --> 01:20:35.946
No, don't be naive.

01:20:35.947 --> 01:20:39.016
It's not an appealing
quality in a man your age.

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.885
Of course, she's never
cheated on me before.

01:20:42.886 --> 01:20:44.219
That you know of.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.022
That I know of.

01:20:47.658 --> 01:20:49.627
Well, even if she didn't,

01:20:49.827 --> 01:20:51.227
dying changes people.

01:20:51.228 --> 01:20:52.127
Not always for the better.

01:20:52.128 --> 01:20:54.397
Imagine if the world were about to end.

01:20:54.398 --> 01:20:55.797
You think people would
just fuck their spouses?

01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:57.967
Of course not.

01:20:59.703 --> 01:21:00.836
Well you really think

01:21:00.837 --> 01:21:02.906
that my wife is being unfaithful

01:21:02.907 --> 01:21:05.943
right now at this moment?

01:21:07.778 --> 01:21:10.080
When can I look?

01:21:10.413 --> 01:21:11.648
Well, but promise me first

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:13.383
<i>you won't be too disappointed.</i>

01:21:13.384 --> 01:21:16.052
I will not be disappointed.

01:21:28.731 --> 01:21:30.534
What do you think?

01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:33.137
This your design?

01:21:33.837 --> 01:21:35.837
I used some of
my ideas from school and

01:21:35.838 --> 01:21:37.674
the entrance is from my graduate thesis

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:40.477
and elements of these.

01:21:40.711 --> 01:21:42.444
I know there's a lot of work to be done

01:21:42.445 --> 01:21:45.114
it'll probably never be built but-

01:21:46.216 --> 01:21:47.849
It's good,

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.318
isn't it?

01:21:49.319 --> 01:21:51.354
It's beautiful.

01:21:52.855 --> 01:21:54.624
I didn't know you could do that.

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:56.427
Neither did I.

01:21:56.694 --> 01:21:58.461
And I've got so many other ideas for

01:21:58.462 --> 01:22:00.362
a library with a three-storey atrium,

01:22:00.363 --> 01:22:03.566
and a community centre with
an indoor garden, I just-

01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:05.535
Better late than never.

01:22:05.868 --> 01:22:07.671
Do you think?

01:22:08.104 --> 01:22:11.507
Or is it better to die thinking
you did the best you could?

01:22:12.775 --> 01:22:15.044
I don't really know.

01:22:18.314 --> 01:22:20.015
Do you know, I'm not entirely sure he's not

01:22:20.016 --> 01:22:21.584
a serial killer.

01:22:21.585 --> 01:22:23.353
<i>I really wanted to find
the love of my life</i>

01:22:23.354 --> 01:22:24.853
<i>before Mum dies.</i>

01:22:24.854 --> 01:22:25.854
Me too.

01:22:25.855 --> 01:22:26.989
Yeah, me too.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:28.358
You really did love her, huh?

01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:30.160
Wrong tense, honey.

01:22:30.327 --> 01:22:31.594
I mean, I might never have won the God-damn

01:22:31.595 --> 01:22:33.028
Tolstoy Prize,

01:22:33.029 --> 01:22:35.465
but if I hadn't shagged Tamara,

01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:38.268
<i>your mother would never
have found Tom and then...</i>

01:22:40.604 --> 01:22:42.404
Kaitlyn, now that we've
got to know each other

01:22:42.405 --> 01:22:43.473
<i>a little bit</i>

01:22:43.474 --> 01:22:45.409
there's something I'd like to say.

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.544
Your arrival on this planet
may have ruined my life,

01:22:48.545 --> 01:22:50.547
but you were worth it.

01:22:51.614 --> 01:22:53.417
Thank you.

01:22:53.618 --> 01:22:54.350
I'm still gonna try and
win your mother's heart

01:22:54.351 --> 01:22:56.486
before it's too late, though.

01:22:56.487 --> 01:22:58.420
You'll understand when you've
made as many stupid mistakes

01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:00.790
as we've made and that day will come.

01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:01.791
Oh, I don't think so.

01:23:01.792 --> 01:23:02.825
<i>I don't think that many.</i>

01:23:02.826 --> 01:23:04.661
Well, let's hope not.

01:23:04.662 --> 01:23:05.961
Oh, whatever.

01:23:05.962 --> 01:23:07.563
I'll be here for you, whatever you need.

01:23:07.564 --> 01:23:08.930
<i>Boyfriends punching,</i>

01:23:08.931 --> 01:23:10.066
job searching,

01:23:10.067 --> 01:23:11.634
<i>first date chaperone,</i>

01:23:11.635 --> 01:23:13.771
<i>impractical and unsolicited advice.</i>

01:23:14.671 --> 01:23:15.904
I'm your man.

01:23:15.905 --> 01:23:17.708
Thanks.

01:23:18.975 --> 01:23:20.410
Well, it's getting late.

01:23:20.411 --> 01:23:21.911
Yeah, I wonder if your mum is back yet.

01:23:21.912 --> 01:23:23.645
No, she didn't want to
go out to a restaurant,

01:23:23.646 --> 01:23:25.380
so she said she'd bring
in take-out, we'd dress up

01:23:25.381 --> 01:23:27.684
and have a nice family dinner at home.

01:23:27.685 --> 01:23:29.085
I'm gonna go back to my place to change.

01:23:29.086 --> 01:23:30.586
- Alright.
- I'll come with you.

01:23:30.587 --> 01:23:32.421
Look, I'll see you guys
back at the house, okay?

01:23:32.422 --> 01:23:34.390
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:41.732
Hello?

01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.739
Gracie!

01:23:54.845 --> 01:23:56.044
Anyone?

01:23:58.414 --> 01:23:59.415
<i>Gracie.</i>

01:23:59.416 --> 01:24:01.218
Shh shh!

01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:11.260
Oh, shit. Shit!

01:24:13.463 --> 01:24:14.996
<i>Darling, Gracie's not here.</i>

01:24:14.997 --> 01:24:16.631
Tamara, Jesus!

01:24:16.632 --> 01:24:18.434
You should be thanking me.

01:24:18.435 --> 01:24:19.635
You tell her about this,

01:24:19.636 --> 01:24:22.139
you get to be her one last true love.

01:24:24.707 --> 01:24:25.707
Hi.

01:24:25.708 --> 01:24:27.511
Sorry I'm late.

01:24:32.983 --> 01:24:34.050
Hi.

01:24:34.051 --> 01:24:35.718
Oh, hi, are the girls here?

01:24:35.719 --> 01:24:36.986
Ah, they'll be here soon.

01:24:36.987 --> 01:24:38.621
Ah, great, will you take
these into the kitchen,

01:24:38.622 --> 01:24:39.754
I just need to get changed.

01:24:40.724 --> 01:24:42.125
I'd love to but it's my back.

01:24:42.126 --> 01:24:44.160
That damn futon. It's killing me.

01:24:44.161 --> 01:24:45.661
Alright.

01:24:45.662 --> 01:24:47.664
You've got a bad back.

01:24:47.864 --> 01:24:49.599
I've got a brain tumour.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.401
It's fine.

01:24:59.143 --> 01:25:00.510
Listen, Gracie,

01:25:00.511 --> 01:25:01.644
there's something I need to tell you.

01:25:01.645 --> 01:25:02.644
No.

01:25:02.645 --> 01:25:03.545
<i>No, it's not about-</i>

01:25:03.546 --> 01:25:06.047
Please don't tell me you love me, okay?

01:25:06.048 --> 01:25:07.550
<i>You're right.</i>

01:25:07.551 --> 01:25:08.885
Maybe my life didn't turn out

01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:11.487
exactly as I would have wanted it.

01:25:11.488 --> 01:25:12.688
<i>My work is shit.</i>

01:25:12.689 --> 01:25:14.689
My daughters are wonderful

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:16.493
but clueless and

01:25:17.161 --> 01:25:19.562
I-I'm never gonna finish Middlemarch.

01:25:19.563 --> 01:25:21.496
But I don't want to
think that the whole thing

01:25:21.497 --> 01:25:23.699
has been a mistake.

01:25:24.534 --> 01:25:27.103
Tom might not be the most
exciting man in the world,

01:25:27.104 --> 01:25:29.772
but I know that he really loves me so

01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:33.843
please just leave me my marriage, okay?

01:25:35.679 --> 01:25:37.481
Yeah, babe.

01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:41.351
And just...

01:25:41.484 --> 01:25:43.118
I'm just gonna go upstairs to get changed.

01:25:43.119 --> 01:25:44.853
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:44.854 --> 01:25:46.721
<i>Just stay in this room a
minute. Don't leave the room.</i>

01:25:46.722 --> 01:25:48.590
Oh, for God's sake, when will you grow up?!

01:25:48.591 --> 01:25:50.091
I've got a surprise for you.

01:25:50.092 --> 01:25:51.126
<i>Alright?</i>

01:25:51.127 --> 01:25:52.461
Just stay here.

01:25:52.462 --> 01:25:53.462
Promise?

01:25:53.463 --> 01:25:54.529
Promise me?

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:55.997
<i>Stay here? Right? Promise?</i>

01:25:55.998 --> 01:25:57.801
Go, go.

01:26:04.608 --> 01:26:06.209
<i>You fuckin' ass-holes.</i>

01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:08.345
Alright, listen to me carefully.

01:26:08.479 --> 01:26:09.612
This didn't happen, alright?

01:26:09.613 --> 01:26:11.546
No one tells Gracie.

01:26:11.547 --> 01:26:13.749
But, well I thought you'd want her to know.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:16.686
Just let her die in peace!

01:26:16.953 --> 01:26:17.953
Promise me?

01:26:17.954 --> 01:26:18.955
I'm not gonna tell her.

01:26:18.956 --> 01:26:20.723
I don't want her to know.

01:26:20.724 --> 01:26:22.591
I can make your life hell and you know it.

01:26:22.592 --> 01:26:23.693
Fine.

01:26:23.694 --> 01:26:24.861
I won't tell her.

01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:26.094
Alright, hurry up.

01:26:26.095 --> 01:26:28.431
I can't keep her downstairs forever.

01:26:29.099 --> 01:26:30.566
Grace isn't gonna know.

01:26:30.567 --> 01:26:31.634
<i>Grace isn't gonna know, thank God.</i>

01:26:31.635 --> 01:26:32.702
<i>I really must</i>

01:26:32.703 --> 01:26:34.671
stop drinking.

01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:41.777
What-what's the surprise?

01:26:41.778 --> 01:26:43.647
This.

01:26:43.846 --> 01:26:45.113
Well, what about it?

01:26:45.114 --> 01:26:47.783
Why, I've put on my blue sweater.

01:26:48.784 --> 01:26:50.152
You always said you liked me in blue.

01:26:50.153 --> 01:26:51.621
Oh my god, I don't believe this.

01:26:51.622 --> 01:26:52.621
Look, Grace, wait just a minute.

01:26:52.622 --> 01:26:53.755
I've given you enough time

01:26:53.756 --> 01:26:55.657
and I'd like to see my husband.

01:26:55.658 --> 01:26:56.858
<i>There you are!</i>

01:26:56.859 --> 01:26:58.729
I missed you.

01:26:59.595 --> 01:27:00.763
Have you been drinking?

01:27:00.764 --> 01:27:01.863
Sorry.

01:27:01.864 --> 01:27:03.666
<i>I'm really, really sorry.</i>

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:05.800
Oh, no, I-I suppose it's understandable.

01:27:05.801 --> 01:27:08.305
The circumstances.

01:27:08.738 --> 01:27:10.539
I love you!

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.174
You do?

01:27:12.175 --> 01:27:14.477
Of course I do.

01:27:23.185 --> 01:27:25.855
Looks like you lost, Dad.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:31.294
No one but myself to blame.

01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:36.098
This is delicious.

01:27:36.099 --> 01:27:37.567
So there are three pavilions,

01:27:37.568 --> 01:27:39.769
and the whole building is solar panelled.

01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:41.002
That sounds amazing.

01:27:41.003 --> 01:27:41.903
You know, Mum, I realized

01:27:41.904 --> 01:27:42.938
that you're right,

01:27:42.939 --> 01:27:44.974
I can expand my paper and

01:27:44.975 --> 01:27:46.175
write a book of my own.

01:27:46.176 --> 01:27:48.845
I'll introduce you to my publisher.

01:27:49.212 --> 01:27:50.246
And I was thinking,

01:27:50.247 --> 01:27:51.046
I'm gonna take some courses

01:27:51.047 --> 01:27:53.917
and figure out what I like most.

01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:56.619
Academically speaking.

01:27:57.087 --> 01:27:59.056
This is a perfect evening.

01:27:59.189 --> 01:28:00.156
Are you-

01:28:00.157 --> 01:28:01.791
Are sure you don't want us to stay tonight?

01:28:01.792 --> 01:28:03.059
No, no, I'm gonna have a quiet

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.193
evening in with my husband.

01:28:04.194 --> 01:28:04.993
Zoe can keep you company,

01:28:04.994 --> 01:28:06.996
and Tamara can get off the sofa,

01:28:06.997 --> 01:28:08.863
<i>and we'll all meet
up in the morning.</i>

01:28:08.864 --> 01:28:10.599
I don't have to be at a hospital till four,

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.233
so we've got plenty of time.

01:28:12.234 --> 01:28:14.037
To Gracie.

01:28:14.671 --> 01:28:16.772
The love of our lives.

01:28:17.807 --> 01:28:19.075
Definitely.

01:28:19.076 --> 01:28:21.744
Well I'll just sit this one out, shall I?

01:28:21.877 --> 01:28:24.680
<i>- To Mum.</i>
- Grace.

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:31.219
Thanks.

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.354
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:28:32.355 --> 01:28:34.490
<i>I thought you were upstairs.</i>

01:28:35.359 --> 01:28:37.727
Just closing down for the night.

01:28:37.728 --> 01:28:38.961
I'll be fine in the dark.

01:28:38.962 --> 01:28:40.764
You know,

01:28:42.399 --> 01:28:46.403
when you came here I was
really angry with you.

01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:48.705
<i>And Tamara!</i>

01:28:49.006 --> 01:28:50.906
<i>But tonight was so great,</i>

01:28:50.907 --> 01:28:52.774
and the girls seemed close to you

01:28:52.775 --> 01:28:54.109
and well at least that means

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:55.277
<i>that there are more
people to help them,</i>

01:28:55.278 --> 01:28:57.080
you know.

01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:02.251
I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:29:02.252 --> 01:29:04.921
but I'm really glad that you came.

01:29:05.389 --> 01:29:06.889
Even Tamara.

01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:08.124
Well, she's my daughter's stepmother

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.791
and I guess that is kind of family.

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:11.595
Right?

01:29:16.766 --> 01:29:18.000
So, are
you-are you-

01:29:18.001 --> 01:29:19.936
are you coming to bed?

01:29:20.804 --> 01:29:23.106
Well, unless that's an invitation,

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:25.407
I think I'd rather stay out
of earshot of your bedroom

01:29:25.408 --> 01:29:28.077
for the next little while.

01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:04.780
Come in.

01:30:06.917 --> 01:30:08.752
Hi.

01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:17.860
I didn't want to say this
in front of everyone but,

01:30:18.194 --> 01:30:20.863
<i>I-I want you to know
that I talked to Zoe</i>

01:30:21.331 --> 01:30:24.733
and she promised to make sure
that you won't grow old alone.

01:30:24.734 --> 01:30:26.535
Oh.

01:30:27.804 --> 01:30:29.806
Thank you, Grace.

01:30:31.073 --> 01:30:34.743
It was so long ago, Tamara,
that you and Richard-

01:30:37.847 --> 01:30:40.349
We were very different people then.

01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:42.152
Were we?

01:30:44.854 --> 01:30:46.522
What I want to say is that

01:30:46.523 --> 01:30:47.989
even though you

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:49.358
slept with my husband
and it was immortalized

01:30:49.359 --> 01:30:52.028
into a best selling novel, I-

01:30:53.963 --> 01:30:56.632
I actually would like us to be friends.

01:30:58.502 --> 01:30:59.501
Really?

01:30:59.502 --> 01:31:01.504
Yeah.

01:31:03.974 --> 01:31:05.941
- Yeah.
- Of course.

01:31:06.408 --> 01:31:08.211
Great.

01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:13.682
Grace.

01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:15.652
Yeah?

01:31:16.987 --> 01:31:18.821
Nothing.

01:31:35.204 --> 01:31:37.207
Just the two of us.

01:31:40.944 --> 01:31:42.946
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:31:47.884 --> 01:31:48.884
If you don't-

01:31:48.885 --> 01:31:49.885
If you don't feel well enough-

01:31:49.886 --> 01:31:51.688
I feel fine.

01:31:52.354 --> 01:31:54.256
Well, I was-

01:31:54.457 --> 01:31:55.556
just um,

01:31:58.427 --> 01:31:59.428
Remember, if you're-

01:31:59.429 --> 01:32:01.095
If you're too tired

01:32:01.096 --> 01:32:02.163
I am not tired.

01:32:02.164 --> 01:32:03.832
And even if I was

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:06.636
this might be the last
chance we have to make love.

01:32:07.304 --> 01:32:08.304
Yeah.

01:32:08.305 --> 01:32:10.272
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:10.273 --> 01:32:12.575
You've been a wonderful husband.

01:32:19.315 --> 01:32:21.917
<i>Grace, Grace, Grace,
Grace, Grace, Grace!</i>

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:28.389
I really didn't think I was
gonna do this, but uh I...

01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:30.091
There's something I...

01:32:30.092 --> 01:32:32.261
There something I have to confess.

01:32:32.996 --> 01:32:34.864
What is it?

01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:36.465
Well,

01:32:36.466 --> 01:32:38.099
I may have

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.035
been unfaithful.

01:32:43.073 --> 01:32:44.874
I know.

01:32:45.876 --> 01:32:47.677
You know?

01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:49.913
Yeah.

01:32:50.947 --> 01:32:52.749
It's okay.

01:32:53.082 --> 01:32:54.483
Is it?!

01:32:54.484 --> 01:32:56.653
Yeah, it's not great.

01:32:56.953 --> 01:32:59.756
Do I wish it hadn't happened, yes, but-

01:33:00.256 --> 01:33:03.091
when I met you I was at
the lowest point in my life

01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:05.260
and you did everything you
could to help me and Zoe

01:33:05.261 --> 01:33:07.631
even though you weren't her father.

01:33:08.497 --> 01:33:11.000
You knew I was still stuck on Richard

01:33:11.001 --> 01:33:13.969
but you never complained so

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:15.536
I think I can cut you a bit of slack

01:33:15.537 --> 01:33:18.207
and allow you one mistake.

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.975
You probably were
drinking ahead of the lot.

01:33:20.976 --> 01:33:21.977
Yeah, I was, yeah.

01:33:21.978 --> 01:33:23.780
Yeah.

01:33:24.046 --> 01:33:25.647
So,

01:33:26.115 --> 01:33:28.784
let's just pretend it never happened.

01:33:32.255 --> 01:33:34.223
That's such a relief.

01:33:36.525 --> 01:33:38.460
I'm so sorry.

01:33:38.461 --> 01:33:40.363
I'm so sorry.

01:33:42.164 --> 01:33:43.967
Grace.

01:33:44.466 --> 01:33:46.535
How did you find out?

01:33:46.536 --> 01:33:48.672
She told me.

01:33:49.139 --> 01:33:50.406
She told you?

01:33:50.407 --> 01:33:51.941
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:33:51.942 --> 01:33:53.842
She told you?

01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:55.411
Well, she promised she wouldn't.

01:33:55.412 --> 01:33:57.712
She never could keep a secret.

01:33:57.713 --> 01:33:59.716
No, I guess not.

01:34:00.182 --> 01:34:02.584
That was why I accepted the job in Toronto.

01:34:02.585 --> 01:34:04.185
It wasn't to get away from Richard,

01:34:04.186 --> 01:34:07.356
it was to get away from Brenda.

01:34:07.623 --> 01:34:10.159
Brenda? Well who...

01:34:12.061 --> 01:34:14.230
Oh, Brenda.

01:34:16.032 --> 01:34:18.834
You weren't talking about Brenda, were you?

01:34:22.238 --> 01:34:23.639
So who were you talking about?

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.573
TAMARA, GET UP!

01:34:24.574 --> 01:34:25.808
I thought you were having sex with Richard,

01:34:25.809 --> 01:34:28.176
because Tamara said you had
snuck out of the house together

01:34:28.177 --> 01:34:30.179
- last night.
- I have never cheated on you!

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:32.315
I didn't want to be alone and

01:34:32.748 --> 01:34:34.082
it was her idea.

01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:35.317
I didn't hear you complaining

01:34:35.318 --> 01:34:36.585
when I had my hands down your pants.

01:34:36.586 --> 01:34:38.388
Oh god.

01:34:38.721 --> 01:34:40.456
I-I was afraid it would be
my last chance to have sex

01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:43.091
and I really wanted to
have a big bang fuck and I-

01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:45.059
and I'm sorry so can we all go back to bed?

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.594
I really don't think
we have a problem here.

01:34:46.595 --> 01:34:47.595
There is a problem.

01:34:47.596 --> 01:34:48.596
Only because of Richard.

01:34:48.597 --> 01:34:49.598
- Richard?
- Yeah.

01:34:49.599 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah, Richard, Richard.

01:34:51.001 --> 01:34:52.201
It's all Richard's fault.

01:34:52.202 --> 01:34:53.602
He's the one you should be screaming at!

01:34:53.603 --> 01:34:55.771
How is it Richard's fault?

01:34:56.139 --> 01:34:58.072
How is this Richard's fault?

01:34:58.073 --> 01:34:59.008
<i>Yeah, because I bet that he-he</i>

01:34:59.009 --> 01:35:00.509
put you up to the whole thing, didn't he?

01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:01.510
To win Grace back.

01:35:01.511 --> 01:35:02.778
Listen.

01:35:02.779 --> 01:35:04.212
<i>If Richard was the
love of your life,</i>

01:35:04.213 --> 01:35:06.114
I did a truly horrible,

01:35:06.115 --> 01:35:08.017
unforgivable thing when
I stole him from you.

01:35:08.018 --> 01:35:10.219
I really did, it's the
worst thing I've ever done.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.022
I don't want you dying
with that on my conscience.

01:35:13.088 --> 01:35:15.024
Married men, fine.

01:35:15.225 --> 01:35:16.358
Whatever.

01:35:16.359 --> 01:35:18.227
But you had a baby.

01:35:18.228 --> 01:35:20.096
And no money.

01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:22.799
And you really, really loved him.

01:35:23.233 --> 01:35:24.366
So, sorry,

01:35:24.367 --> 01:35:26.100
I-I-I don't
get this.

01:35:26.101 --> 01:35:28.670
You're feeling guilty because
you slept with my husband so

01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:30.639
now you sleep with my other husband.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.241
When he told me all this stuff about you

01:35:32.242 --> 01:35:33.575
being his true love I thought,

01:35:33.576 --> 01:35:35.376
you know, he was mad.

01:35:35.377 --> 01:35:37.278
So I came here to find out

01:35:37.279 --> 01:35:40.282
if husband number two was your true love.

01:35:40.283 --> 01:35:42.251
And what did I find?

01:35:42.252 --> 01:35:44.085
I am her true love.

01:35:44.086 --> 01:35:45.887
Your true love doesn't
sleep with someone else

01:35:45.888 --> 01:35:48.157
when you're dying, sweetie.

01:35:48.257 --> 01:35:50.392
- Yeah, but maybe-
- Shh!

01:35:50.592 --> 01:35:52.395
So...

01:35:52.662 --> 01:35:54.830
I wrecked your life.

01:35:55.532 --> 01:35:57.133
<i>Didn't I?</i>

01:35:57.533 --> 01:35:59.167
The least I could do to make amends

01:35:59.168 --> 01:36:00.736
was to make sure your
last fuck was with Richard.

01:36:00.737 --> 01:36:03.404
Not just your last fuck, that's just sex,

01:36:03.405 --> 01:36:04.806
we're old enough to know how little the old

01:36:04.807 --> 01:36:06.575
<i>in and out matters.
No, it was just that,</i>

01:36:06.576 --> 01:36:09.678
<i>that he'd be the one holding
your hand in the hospital,</i>

01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:12.214
and that if you live,

01:36:12.849 --> 01:36:15.517
you get to be together
for the rest of your lives.

01:36:16.552 --> 01:36:18.488
It makes sense.

01:36:18.587 --> 01:36:19.587
And yeah,

01:36:19.588 --> 01:36:23.426
maybe I'd have someone
to look after me, too.

01:36:24.194 --> 01:36:25.193
<i>But then, you know,</i>

01:36:25.194 --> 01:36:26.761
Richard wouldn't tell
you that I'd slept with

01:36:26.762 --> 01:36:28.296
husband number two. Don't know why.

01:36:28.297 --> 01:36:30.098
RICHARD!

01:36:30.365 --> 01:36:31.767
<i>RICHARD!</i>

01:36:31.768 --> 01:36:33.501
I don't want to see Richard.

01:36:33.502 --> 01:36:34.769
I don't want to see anyone.

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:36.438
I just wish I was dead already.

01:36:36.439 --> 01:36:38.241
Oh, Grace.

01:36:39.175 --> 01:36:41.242
Well, that's the
trouble with life, isn't it?

01:36:41.243 --> 01:36:43.345
Doesn't always work out the way you plan.

01:36:45.247 --> 01:36:48.150
Oh, cheer up, sweetheart.

01:36:48.318 --> 01:36:50.386
You still have me.

01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:31.194
Hi, Tyler.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.896
Hey, gorgeous.

01:37:34.296 --> 01:37:35.930
What are you doing for
the rest of your life?

01:37:35.931 --> 01:37:38.600
You're a kinder man than you used to be.

01:37:39.636 --> 01:37:40.635
Yeah, well,

01:37:40.636 --> 01:37:41.803
better late than never, ah?

01:37:41.804 --> 01:37:44.473
I wish people would stop saying that.

01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:55.218
You know,

01:37:55.484 --> 01:37:58.587
I have to say my feelings
are a little bit hurt.

01:37:58.954 --> 01:38:00.555
Your feelings hurt?

01:38:00.556 --> 01:38:02.357
Yeah.

01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:05.227
I was hoping to do better
than last man standing.

01:38:37.827 --> 01:38:38.827
Tyler,

01:38:38.828 --> 01:38:40.761
how much would it cost
you to leave for an hour

01:38:40.762 --> 01:38:42.898
and let us lock the door?

01:38:42.899 --> 01:38:43.898
50?

01:38:43.899 --> 01:38:45.600
Done.

01:38:59.748 --> 01:39:02.118
At least I won't die horny.

01:39:05.387 --> 01:39:07.723
<i>I'm not gonna tell the
girls about what Tom did.</i>

01:39:07.724 --> 01:39:08.991
No.

01:39:08.992 --> 01:39:10.126
<i>I'll just say that he got drunk</i>

01:39:10.127 --> 01:39:12.728
and had too much of a
hangover to leave the bedroom.

01:39:12.729 --> 01:39:14.462
They will believe that.

01:39:14.463 --> 01:39:15.563
And get rid of Tamara.

01:39:15.564 --> 01:39:16.732
<i>I don't care how you do it.</i>

01:39:16.733 --> 01:39:19.401
<i>And yes, murder is an option.</i>

01:39:19.935 --> 01:39:22.504
So much for dying in peace.

01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:25.173
Was I the love of your life?

01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:29.178
The love of my life?

01:39:31.613 --> 01:39:33.415
Does it really ever matter that much?

01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:35.817
We spend so much of our time thinking,

01:39:35.818 --> 01:39:37.419
<i>does he love me? He doesn't love me.</i>

01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.222
Do I love him?

01:39:39.655 --> 01:39:41.689
But it can't be that only

01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:44.492
<i>the tiny fraction of
people with happy marriages</i>

01:39:44.493 --> 01:39:46.294
have lives that matter,

01:39:46.929 --> 01:39:49.298
or else you and I are fucked.

01:39:52.034 --> 01:39:54.703
We all die alone, anyway.

01:39:56.506 --> 01:39:58.307
Hey.

01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:01.510
You know,

01:40:01.511 --> 01:40:02.510
if I'm reincarnated,

01:40:02.511 --> 01:40:03.644
do you know who I hope

01:40:03.645 --> 01:40:05.781
I can marry in my next life?

01:40:06.416 --> 01:40:07.916
I'm afraid to ask.

01:40:07.917 --> 01:40:09.518
<i>I do actually think</i>

01:40:09.519 --> 01:40:12.187
that he was the love of my life.

01:40:14.556 --> 01:40:16.359
Billy.

01:40:17.527 --> 01:40:19.328
Billy.

01:40:21.096 --> 01:40:23.532
Yeah, he was a great dog.

01:40:23.533 --> 01:40:25.000
Great, great, great dog.

01:40:25.001 --> 01:40:27.669
Yeah, I can't compete with Billy.

01:40:29.005 --> 01:40:30.807
But did-

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.541
You do love me, don't you?

01:40:33.542 --> 01:40:35.477
Of course I love you.

01:40:36.945 --> 01:40:39.347
Maybe not only you.

01:40:40.582 --> 01:40:42.550
Well, when I take you to Machu Picchu

01:40:42.551 --> 01:40:44.853
Oh, please take the girls to Machu Picchu.

01:40:44.854 --> 01:40:48.825
<i>And don't let Tamara
live in my house.</i>

01:40:49.826 --> 01:40:50.725
Oh my god.

01:40:50.726 --> 01:40:52.027
I've forgotten to buy a funeral plot.

01:40:52.028 --> 01:40:54.696
Where then am I gonna be buried?

01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:56.564
Oh god.

01:40:56.565 --> 01:40:58.700
There is still so much to sort out.

01:40:58.701 --> 01:40:59.968
Hey, hey.

01:40:59.969 --> 01:41:01.569
Richard, I'm not ready.

01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:02.671
Come here.

01:41:06.475 --> 01:41:09.144
It's alright, it's alright.

01:41:10.747 --> 01:41:13.447
You're gonna come through
this surgery just fine.

01:41:13.448 --> 01:41:15.251
Yeah?

01:41:15.752 --> 01:41:17.553
In fact,

01:41:18.054 --> 01:41:19.856
<i>I'm certain,</i>

01:41:21.724 --> 01:41:24.392
and I'm a little bit psychic, you know?

01:41:27.529 --> 01:41:30.198
That your best years are ahead of you.

01:41:33.002 --> 01:41:34.935
<i>Grace! Grace!</i>

01:41:34.936 --> 01:41:36.737
Gracie.

01:41:36.738 --> 01:41:37.838
Gracie?

01:41:46.615 --> 01:41:49.418
I'm really looking
forward to Machu Picchu.

01:41:49.484 --> 01:41:51.287
Me, too.

01:41:51.421 --> 01:41:53.356
Yeah, me, too.

01:41:56.024 --> 01:41:57.626
Hey.

01:41:57.627 --> 01:41:58.660
<i>Hello.</i>

01:41:58.661 --> 01:42:00.495
Hi.

01:42:04.634 --> 01:42:06.836
Well, there it is.

01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:11.440
Built exactly to her plans.

01:42:11.841 --> 01:42:13.041
They just put the finishing touches

01:42:13.042 --> 01:42:15.711
to the interior paint this morning.

01:42:25.688 --> 01:42:27.221
It's beautiful.

01:42:27.222 --> 01:42:29.225
Isn't it?

01:42:29.524 --> 01:42:30.591
I love it.

01:42:30.592 --> 01:42:31.693
It's gorgeous.

01:42:43.139 --> 01:42:45.206
Fuck you world.

01:42:45.207 --> 01:42:47.209
Here I am.

01:42:48.677 --> 01:42:50.645
Now we can go to Machu Picchu.
