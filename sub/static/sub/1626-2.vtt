00:13.271 --> 00:15.139
Oh, hey.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.974
You ready?

00:16.975 --> 00:20.611
I can't. I just can't.

00:20.612 --> 00:23.747
Everyone feels like that the
first few times you eat here.

00:23.748 --> 00:24.748
It's like heroin.

00:24.749 --> 00:25.950
It makes you sick, and you think,

00:25.951 --> 00:27.985
"I'll never do that again," and here we are.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.689
No, we put our project on Kickstarter,

00:31.690 --> 00:34.692
and we're getting major funding right now.

00:34.693 --> 00:38.195
And I can't. I just can't.

00:38.196 --> 00:39.797
Kickstarter... that's the website

00:39.798 --> 00:41.298
where strangers give money for crap

00:41.299 --> 00:43.300
that no one in the real world
would invest in, right?

00:43.301 --> 00:47.304
Exactly, but our project isn't crap.
It's bananas.

00:47.305 --> 00:51.709
We design candles with arms.

00:51.710 --> 00:55.980
I can't. I just can't.

00:55.981 --> 00:57.781
Don't you have a passion project...

00:57.782 --> 00:59.216
something you've always wanted to do?

00:59.217 --> 01:03.187
Yeah, you can't just want to
be a waitress your whole life.

01:03.188 --> 01:08.058
Actually... I do have a Kickstarter idea.

01:08.059 --> 01:11.362
I'd like to start kicking your asses!

01:13.865 --> 01:16.200
You know we work for tips, right?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.402
Yeah. This one got away from me.

01:19.738 --> 01:21.705
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:23.308 --> 01:27.211
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:33.090 --> 01:38.297
Okay, listen up, it's Tuesday, and like
Martin Luther King, I have a dream.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.699
Tonight you will do side work.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.869
Hold up, girl. I have ten
minutes till my shift starts.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.237
Max, that is not appropriate.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.439
I'm your boss. Don't call me "girl."

01:47.440 --> 01:50.409
Yes, ma'am.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.945
Okay, you want to play? I'll play.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.814
Hey, sir. Hey, big Manny man.

01:55.815 --> 01:59.785
Why don't you show me your penis?

01:59.786 --> 02:03.722
Han, you know I don't have a penis.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.958
It's the only thing we have in common.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.127
Where's Caroline?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.495
In the back at our cupcake shop.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.297
Why you don't open your walk-up
window till you close here at night?

02:12.298 --> 02:13.932
She's getting a jump on our side work.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.268
What? We can't do ours and yours.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.337
Relax, Marjorie.

02:18.338 --> 02:21.673
Keep it up, Max, and one day
I will show you my penis.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.343
And you'll be sorry.

02:28.948 --> 02:31.917
Yes. Yes, I will.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.119
That's it! New rule!

02:34.120 --> 02:37.456
No more making fun of the boss!

02:37.457 --> 02:39.958
Han doesn't want us
calling him names anymore.

02:39.959 --> 02:43.829
It's like, if you don't want to be
called names, don't look like that.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.265
♪ When a fire starts to burn, right... ♪

02:46.266 --> 02:48.767
Why is the window open? What is all that?

02:48.768 --> 02:51.303
It's me, if I had lived.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.139
♪ When a fire starts to burn, right... ♪

02:54.140 --> 02:56.108
Oh, my God. Did you see that rack?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.977
See it? I have to carry it around all day.

02:58.978 --> 03:02.314
I've been wearing the same
clothes every day for two years.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.452
Now, I know that's your dream scenario,
but to me, it's a horror show.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.653
Go get new clothes.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.456
Just go to the place around the
corner and buy some cheap ones.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.791
Max, they sell clothes by the pound.

03:12.792 --> 03:17.229
That's why it's called the fashion
pound, and that is why it is awesome.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.498
Look, I'm willing to cut
a lot of other things,

03:19.499 --> 03:22.167
including my wrists,
but I need quality clothes.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.169
The only reason I've been able
to wear these pants every day

03:24.170 --> 03:25.404
is because they're quality.

03:25.405 --> 03:30.676
Well, that and a lot of
febreze, which reminds me...

03:32.612 --> 03:34.379
I used to smell like money.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.081
Now I smell like pennies.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.751
And, Max, you need a hit.

03:39.752 --> 03:43.155
'Breze me.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.190
Hi, girls.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.727
Did you see the high-fashion model shoot?

03:48.728 --> 03:52.631
I was too short to be a model in Poland.

03:52.632 --> 03:56.368
Well, I guess you can't have it all, right?

03:56.369 --> 04:00.205
Do I smell febreze?

04:00.206 --> 04:02.641
That's my second-favorite scent.

04:02.642 --> 04:06.044
Oh, and there's my first-favorite scent.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.613
Hey, Sophie.

04:07.614 --> 04:12.618
I'm sorry. Have we met?

04:12.619 --> 04:15.721
I'm not good with faces that
I never want to see again.

04:15.722 --> 04:16.855
What happened?

04:16.856 --> 04:18.190
I thought you guys were gonna be friends.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.392
Yeah, messed-up, passive-aggressive
friends who occasionally sleep together,

04:21.394 --> 04:24.296
like Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell.

04:24.297 --> 04:27.132
Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.201
You're pretending like we don't have

04:29.202 --> 04:32.404
movie-character names for our private parts.

04:34.040 --> 04:39.611
Well, good-bye, miss, and give
my regards to Mrs. Doubtfire.

04:39.612 --> 04:43.182
Okay, E.T., go home!

04:44.851 --> 04:47.085
Here's your mail, girls.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.256
Max, Sophie had a new purse.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.925
Everybody has something new.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.527
Even the homeless lady on
the bus had a new barrette,

04:55.528 --> 04:59.298
and even though her feet were
split open, I still felt jealous.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.732
Oh, this is not a bill.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.068
Now, that's a first.

05:03.069 --> 05:07.406
"We are offering you a new phone, "as
older flip-model phones such as yours

05:07.407 --> 05:08.707
have been degraded."

05:08.708 --> 05:12.077
They're slut-shaming phones now?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.579
I don't want a new anything.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.980
And I like my old flip.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.316
Where's my damn letter
from the pants company,

05:17.317 --> 05:19.284
saying, "girl, those things are tired..."

05:19.285 --> 05:21.753
here's a new pair for free"?

05:21.754 --> 05:23.255
If you want something for free,

05:23.256 --> 05:26.425
why don't you just go on
Kickstarter like everyone else?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.193
You can't use it for clothes.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.295
Can you?

05:30.296 --> 05:35.133
And if you can, can I?

05:35.134 --> 05:38.237
Why not? It's no stupider than candle arms.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.506
Now, if the candles had real arms and
could slap the idiots who bought them,

05:41.507 --> 05:43.308
I'd invest in that.

05:43.309 --> 05:47.279
Max, we have nothing, and if anybody
is giving us something for free,

05:47.280 --> 05:48.347
we're taking it.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.917
You are getting that free phone,
and I am begging for free clothes.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.151
Things are looking up.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.460
You might want to Kickstart some underwear.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.500
Well, obviously, they don't have anything.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.735
Let's go.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.370
Max, stop. My pants just ripped some more.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.039
I have to fix them again.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.580
Hey, quality, why don't you just take them

06:21.581 --> 06:24.149
to Office Depot and get them tailored?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.251
Let's shop.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.691
Oh, they're ripping again.

06:32.692 --> 06:36.895
I feel a breeze up in my febreze.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.665
How can I help you?

06:39.666 --> 06:42.234
Oh, hey. Hi, Cchiandra.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.269
Where can I get a new flip phone?

06:44.270 --> 06:46.772
Let me think.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.008
Guatemala.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.611
I'll miss you, phone.
This is breaking my heart.

06:52.612 --> 06:53.712
Come on, boo.

06:53.713 --> 06:57.849
It's a phone, not Bruno Mars.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.618
Now, I need that letter.

06:59.619 --> 07:00.585
Oh, here it is. I have it.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.586
It's in my purse.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.088
What's her story?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.524
Why is her hand on her ass?

07:05.525 --> 07:07.359
Her staples popped.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.062
Lap band?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.797
Happened to my cousin.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.533
She had a diet 7 up and exploded.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.202
Then she got M.S.

07:17.203 --> 07:21.373
According to judge Joe brown,
it was not related.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.810
Here, I'll just take this one.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.046
Slow down, now. Take a look around.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.682
You got a whole world of possibilities.

07:30.683 --> 07:35.587
Pick 'em up, get a feel, hold
it in your hand for a while.

07:37.523 --> 07:41.259
Chiandra, it's a phone, not Bruno Mars.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.395
Oh, "Texting is easy"

07:43.396 --> 07:45.397
with the new finger friendly keyboard."

07:45.398 --> 07:47.065
My fingers are already too friendly.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.768
Ask my fourth-grade boyfriend.

07:49.769 --> 07:53.238
Wow. These sample texts
are getting kind of racy.

07:53.239 --> 07:57.175
"Bad news... I think
the condom broke last night."

07:58.978 --> 08:01.480
Why would anyone put that on a display model?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.282
That's mine.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.166
I left it there by accident.

08:21.167 --> 08:25.637
But that's not your problem.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.974
Now, tell me, what are your phone needs?

08:28.975 --> 08:31.476
My needs are simple.

08:31.477 --> 08:33.678
I need a phone that can draw
a mustache on people

08:33.679 --> 08:36.181
and occasionally will call
my mother and hang up.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.750
And she needs one with a good camera,

08:38.751 --> 08:42.854
because I have to film
my video pitch for new pants.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.690
I have a hole in my butt.

08:48.961 --> 08:52.063
You know you're supposed to, right?

09:01.174 --> 09:05.343
Max, I might be a virgin again.

09:10.179 --> 09:11.212
I love my new phone!

09:11.213 --> 09:13.181
It's so cool and red.

09:13.182 --> 09:14.549
It feels like anything could happen!

09:14.550 --> 09:15.850
But it probably won't.

09:15.851 --> 09:18.753
My first call.

09:18.754 --> 09:20.755
What do I do?

09:20.756 --> 09:21.923
What do I do?

09:21.924 --> 09:23.958
Oh. Hello?

09:23.959 --> 09:26.694
Oh, hey, girl, good for you. Bye.

09:26.695 --> 09:29.731
Chiandra's not pregnant.

09:29.732 --> 09:32.900
Max, why are you taking calls from Cchiandra?

09:32.901 --> 09:34.068
We have to do my video.

09:34.069 --> 09:35.336
I had to take her call.

09:35.337 --> 09:36.938
She gave me a bunch of free apps...

09:36.939 --> 09:38.539
Angry Birds, Doodle Jump.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.974
If you want to look like
a dog, I could do that.

09:39.975 --> 09:41.843
Look, here's me as a St. Bernard.

09:41.844 --> 09:44.379
See my neck keg?

09:44.380 --> 09:46.214
Okay, I've done some research,

09:46.215 --> 09:48.383
and here's some things
other people want money for.

09:48.384 --> 09:51.085
One woman wants money for a new leg.

09:51.086 --> 09:52.820
Scrolling.

09:52.821 --> 09:55.623
Wait. If she only has one leg,

09:55.624 --> 09:59.560
shouldn't she be on can't-Kickstarter?

09:59.561 --> 10:01.529
Oh, I'm no longer working with them.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.930
They denied my project.

10:02.931 --> 10:06.901
Apparently, I'm not artsy
enough and have too many legs.

10:06.902 --> 10:09.170
So now I'm on go fund yourself.

10:09.171 --> 10:10.571
Oh, perfect.

10:10.572 --> 10:12.674
I've been telling you
to go fund yourself for years.

10:12.675 --> 10:16.411
The future of my pants
hinges on the video pitch.

10:16.412 --> 10:18.313
The tone needs to be sad and pathetic.

10:18.314 --> 10:21.449
Preparation done.

10:21.450 --> 10:24.385
What's sadder than former
billionaire Caroline Channing

10:24.386 --> 10:26.354
asking for money for pants?

10:26.355 --> 10:28.923
Oh, they're not gonna know it's me.

10:32.961 --> 10:35.863
Are you being funded by Al-Qaeda?

10:37.966 --> 10:40.935
If they're buying, I'm taking.

10:40.936 --> 10:43.004
And action.

10:43.005 --> 10:45.707
Hi. I can't tell you my name,

10:45.708 --> 10:49.010
and I can't show you my face
because I'm too ashamed.

10:49.011 --> 10:53.981
Sadly, I find myself in a situation where
I am no longer able to provide myself

10:53.982 --> 10:57.752
with the garments I need in order to
be the best in my day-to-day life.

10:57.753 --> 11:00.254
I'm aware that this is
not a problem for everybody.

11:00.255 --> 11:02.423
Stop, stop! I need to take
a picture of myself

11:02.424 --> 11:04.425
having the most fun I've ever had.

11:04.426 --> 11:07.195
Your nose is coming out of your eyehole.

11:10.265 --> 11:11.366
No.

11:11.367 --> 11:13.301
No, no, no, Max, don't stop.

11:13.302 --> 11:14.702
I'm in a groove.

11:14.703 --> 11:16.938
No, you're in a bag.

11:16.939 --> 11:18.940
Please let me take a picture of you in a bag

11:18.941 --> 11:23.411
and then turn it into a dog
and then call it a doggie bag.

11:23.412 --> 11:26.381
Go, Max, I'm running out of oxygen,

11:26.382 --> 11:29.250
and I think there was cheese in here.

11:29.251 --> 11:31.052
And action.

11:31.053 --> 11:32.620
If I achieve my goal...

11:32.621 --> 11:37.992
specifically, a new pair of quality pants...

11:37.993 --> 11:42.363
then I promise I will give
back to the community,

11:42.364 --> 11:44.098
wearing said pants.

11:44.099 --> 11:46.534
All I need is $1,500.

11:46.535 --> 11:49.570
Stop! Whoa! $1,500?

11:49.571 --> 11:51.506
How many pounds of clothes are you getting?

11:51.507 --> 11:53.141
Look, it's for one pair

11:53.142 --> 11:57.412
of amazing dries van Noten silk
brocade pants... super cute.

11:57.413 --> 12:01.616
And, yes, it's a lot, but my investors
will get something in return.

12:01.617 --> 12:05.920
For $5, they will get the feeling
of goodwill in their heart.

12:05.921 --> 12:07.522
Pbbt!

12:07.523 --> 12:11.826
For $10, I'll send them a selfie
in the new pants that they bought.

12:11.827 --> 12:14.796
For $20, I'll send them
a selfie without pants.

12:17.032 --> 12:19.867
Nobody is gonna give you money
for the stuff you offered.

12:19.868 --> 12:21.202
"Goodwill in their hearts"?

12:21.203 --> 12:23.805
This is the Internet. We're animals.

12:23.806 --> 12:25.139
You're right.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.774
I have an idea.

12:26.775 --> 12:29.243
Camera up.

12:29.244 --> 12:31.546
And action.

12:31.547 --> 12:34.148
I'm sure a lot of you are probably thinking,

12:34.149 --> 12:37.585
"look at this spoiled,
indulgent, clueless girl."

12:37.586 --> 12:39.720
Well, I am.

12:39.721 --> 12:44.325
And you're also probably thinking,
"God, I want to slap her."

12:44.326 --> 12:46.761
Well, guess what. You can!

12:46.762 --> 12:53.835
For $500, you can come here and
slap my spoiled, clueless face.

12:53.836 --> 12:56.037
And cut.

12:56.038 --> 12:57.104
Pretty good?

12:57.105 --> 12:58.840
Genius. Now, here, take the camera.

12:58.841 --> 13:01.776
I want to film my video
to raise $500 to slap you.

13:08.784 --> 13:10.485
Earl, look!

13:10.486 --> 13:13.020
I just got 20 more dollars
from one of my backers!

13:13.021 --> 13:14.755
Now, let me get this straight.

13:14.756 --> 13:18.326
You just ask people for money,
and they give it to you...

13:18.327 --> 13:21.662
without using a weapon?

13:21.663 --> 13:25.333
Well, Earl, I guess desperation
cuts like a knife.

13:25.334 --> 13:29.136
Man, being white is easy.

13:32.641 --> 13:35.142
We're ready to order.

13:43.485 --> 13:45.786
Caroline, I just unlocked the candy hammer.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.822
Can you go over there
and take those girls' orders?

13:47.823 --> 13:51.659
I can't. I just can't.

13:53.328 --> 13:56.264
Oh, no way! I just hit $1,000!

13:56.265 --> 13:58.733
That's almost both legs paid for!

13:58.734 --> 14:00.601
Hello?

14:00.602 --> 14:03.404
You're dinging and donging
right in front of my face.

14:03.405 --> 14:06.340
Can't you at least
put your phones on vibrate?

14:06.341 --> 14:09.911
I don't like to mix business with pleasure.

14:09.912 --> 14:12.513
You two need to be
off your phones and working.

14:12.514 --> 14:14.549
Now. And no back talk.

14:16.752 --> 14:19.620
Totally.

14:20.722 --> 14:23.190
Totally.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.197
- Totally.
- Totally.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.234
Oh, I know what's going on.

14:33.235 --> 14:36.070
You're group-texting insults about me!

14:36.071 --> 14:38.005
We are not.

14:38.006 --> 14:40.875
I got your text!

14:40.876 --> 14:44.879
Han does look like those Minion
things in <i>despicable me!</i>

14:44.880 --> 14:46.447
Oh.

14:46.448 --> 14:50.718
And I thought bullying would end
when I hit four feet.

14:51.887 --> 14:53.287
Oh! Oh, my God!

14:53.288 --> 14:54.789
I'm getting my new pants!

14:54.790 --> 14:56.490
I just got a $500 pledge!

14:56.491 --> 14:59.760
Somebody wants to slap me!
Somebody wants to slap me!

14:59.761 --> 15:01.829
Just one person?

15:06.587 --> 15:09.767
Hey, Han insists we can't leave
tonight without doing our side work,

15:09.768 --> 15:12.570
so I made him into a chihuahua
wearing a diaper.

15:12.571 --> 15:14.905
Check your phone.

15:14.906 --> 15:16.173
Caroline?

15:16.174 --> 15:18.008
<i>Someone got some new pants!</i>

15:18.009 --> 15:20.511
♪ When a fire starts to burn, right ♪

15:20.512 --> 15:22.012
♪ And it starts to spread ♪

15:22.013 --> 15:23.914

15:23.915 --> 15:26.250

15:26.251 --> 15:27.785
♪ When a fire starts to burn, right ♪

15:28.787 --> 15:30.321
I wasn't finished!

15:30.322 --> 15:32.423
No, I was.

15:32.424 --> 15:34.191
Max, I didn't want to tell you this,

15:34.192 --> 15:36.594
but I was secretly worried my Booty was gone.

15:36.595 --> 15:38.128
Turns out, it was just the pants.

15:38.129 --> 15:41.165
It's still there. Take a picture of it.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.033
Okay, let me see.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.401
Perfect!

15:44.402 --> 15:46.804
Now, let's send a group-text
to our diner family,

15:46.805 --> 15:47.905
and I'd like you to copy me on that,

15:47.906 --> 15:49.173
because I want to send it
to my dad in prison.

15:49.174 --> 15:50.774
He'll be so proud.

15:50.775 --> 15:54.244
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure he's
not seeing any asses there.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.146
You know what I love about these pants?

15:56.147 --> 15:58.215
How they make my butt look...

15:58.216 --> 16:00.684
can you see it through the window?

16:01.686 --> 16:05.022
I got new pants.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.126
Hey, Earl, you got my text, right?

16:09.127 --> 16:13.597
You mean that picture of Caroline in her
pants that said, "I'm so sick of her"?

16:13.598 --> 16:14.632
I know, right?

16:14.633 --> 16:17.167
If she ever gets a new shirt, just kill me.

16:17.168 --> 16:21.271
I hear you, Max, but I just can't
believe you included her on the text.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.539
Yeah.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.842
What?

16:24.843 --> 16:27.811
Oh, my God. I didn't take her off the chain.

16:27.812 --> 16:32.483
I mean, if you're gonna trash a child,
you got to take her off the chain.

16:32.484 --> 16:33.917
Look, Earl, they're here!

16:33.918 --> 16:35.953
Look what your $10 is buying you!

16:35.954 --> 16:37.588
Not looking. Don't want to know.

16:37.589 --> 16:40.190
I'm taking myself off the chain.

16:40.191 --> 16:42.026
Hey, Caroline.

16:42.027 --> 16:44.161
Did you get my text? Not yet.

16:44.162 --> 16:45.629
The front of the diner
is a bad reception area.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.464
No, no, no, no.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.499
Don't reach for that.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.302
It's probably just an Amber alert.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.937
Why are you acting weird?

16:53.938 --> 16:56.874
Oh, are you jealous of my new pants?

16:56.875 --> 17:01.478
No, but I may have texted something
about you that I didn't mean,

17:01.479 --> 17:03.213
so just please don't look at your phone.

17:03.214 --> 17:05.115
Okay.

17:05.116 --> 17:09.386
If it's something bad,
I don't want to see it anyway.

17:09.387 --> 17:11.320
She's gonna look at it, isn't she, Earl?

17:11.321 --> 17:12.522
I would.

17:12.523 --> 17:15.125
She just did.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.429
You're so sick of me?

17:18.430 --> 17:21.397
'Cause it's funny!

17:21.398 --> 17:23.634
"I'm so sick of you!"

17:23.635 --> 17:26.670
You know, said funny.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.273
You know how I am. Ask Earl. Earl, help.

17:29.274 --> 17:32.042
Oh, I am off the chain.

17:32.043 --> 17:33.177
Oleg, help.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.612
I'll be in my car.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.147
Oh, look, look! Here's Han!

17:37.148 --> 17:39.149
He knows how I'm always just joking.

17:39.150 --> 17:41.585
Han, nod your head and don't ask why.

17:41.586 --> 17:46.990
Oh, no, last time you asked me to do that,
I wound up on a date with an albino.

17:46.991 --> 17:49.259
And who didn't call who back?

17:49.260 --> 17:52.963
I don't know how they're so confident.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.900
Max, you said you were sick of me.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.936
Oh, why are you so upset?

17:58.937 --> 18:01.371
I say worse things to you all the time.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.574
Yesterday I said you were sad and pathetic.

18:03.575 --> 18:05.275
But that was to my face.

18:05.276 --> 18:08.112
I can't believe you talk
about me behind my back.

18:08.113 --> 18:10.781
It's bad. I am sorry. What can I do?

18:10.782 --> 18:14.218
Hit me. Punch me.
Tell my mother where I live.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.619
Congratulations, Max.

18:15.620 --> 18:20.791
Now you're like all my old
girlfriends, talking behind my back.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.229
Stop looking at that. Delete it.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.198
This is not what I think. I'm
not sick of you. Really?

18:28.199 --> 18:30.200
'Cause when I see it in writing,
it feels like you are.

18:30.201 --> 18:32.136
It's not me. It's this phone.

18:32.137 --> 18:36.774
It brought out the ugliness
that was kind of already there.

18:36.775 --> 18:38.242
There!

18:38.243 --> 18:40.978
I killed it because it hurt you.

18:40.979 --> 18:44.915
I swear I didn't mean it.
You have to believe me.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.784
It's fine, Max.

18:48.887 --> 18:52.523
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

18:56.361 --> 18:58.862
There... I French-fried my phone.

18:58.863 --> 19:00.297
What else can I do?

19:00.298 --> 19:02.833
I mean, really, it is technology's fault.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.535
It's turning us against each other.

19:04.536 --> 19:08.172
Caroline, I swear,
I will never accidentally say

19:08.173 --> 19:11.809
anything about you again that I never meant.

19:11.810 --> 19:14.945
I have to get ready for work. It's fine.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.213
Stop saying that.

19:16.214 --> 19:17.681
Please stop saying it's fine.

19:17.682 --> 19:18.916
"Fine" doesn't mean fine.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.585
The scale goes great, good, okay,

19:21.586 --> 19:24.054
not okay, I hate you, fine.

19:24.055 --> 19:26.990
If "fine" meant fine, that'd be
great, but it doesn't, okay?

19:26.991 --> 19:28.358
You're right. It's not fine.

19:28.359 --> 19:29.693
It sucks. I'm hurt.

19:29.694 --> 19:31.161
You're the one person I care most about.

19:31.162 --> 19:34.031
No, you are the one person
I care the most about.

19:34.032 --> 19:36.433
Well, right now it doesn't feel that way.

19:36.434 --> 19:37.568
It has to feel that way!

19:37.569 --> 19:38.969
You are my best friend, Caroline!

19:38.970 --> 19:41.271
I love you.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.484
Oh, my God, now I'm really gonna throw up.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.854
Max, is that the first time
you said "I love you"?

19:57.889 --> 20:01.225
Don't look at me. I'm embarrassed.

20:01.226 --> 20:03.527
Now what do we do?

20:03.528 --> 20:05.863
So you're not sick of me?

20:05.864 --> 20:10.534
You are the only person in the
entire world I am not sick of.

20:10.535 --> 20:14.104
Caroline...

20:14.105 --> 20:16.940
There's a woman here who said
she paid to slap you.

20:16.941 --> 20:21.378
If I had known it was an option, I would
have thrown my name into that hat.

20:23.715 --> 20:26.917
Well, time to put this on.
That's my $500 pledge.

20:26.918 --> 20:28.819
I'll go. What?

20:28.820 --> 20:30.287
I'll take it. I deserve it.

20:30.288 --> 20:33.156
You've already gotten
a slap in the face from me.

20:33.157 --> 20:34.925
But she's expecting to see me.

20:34.926 --> 20:38.929
No, she's expecting to see a
clueless woman wearing a paper bag.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.197
And even though I wasn't planning

20:40.198 --> 20:44.201
on becoming that woman for
another 20, 25 years, I owe you.

20:48.907 --> 20:51.241
Seriously? You're not gonna stop me?

20:52.644 --> 20:54.344
Nope.

20:54.345 --> 20:58.916
And, Max... I love you too.

20:59.951 --> 21:02.119
I'm so sick of you.

21:02.144 --> 21:06.737
