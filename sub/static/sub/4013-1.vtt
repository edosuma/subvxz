01:32.590 --> 01:35.080
News has come from Vienna!

01:35.290 --> 01:40.090
"Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard
on his return from the Crusades.

01:40.260 --> 01:45.100
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.

01:45.270 --> 01:50.600
His Highness Prince John will make
further public pronouncement tomorrow."

01:52.580 --> 01:56.480
And how are the dear Saxons
taking the news, Sir Guy?

01:57.180 --> 01:59.610
They're even more worried than Longchamps,
Your Highness.

01:59.780 --> 02:03.580
They'll be more than worried when I squeeze
the fat out of their pampered hides.

02:03.750 --> 02:07.310
- You intend to act on your plans?
- What better moment than this, Sir Guy?

02:07.490 --> 02:12.150
Whoever would have thought my dear brother
would be so considerate as to get captured...

02:12.330 --> 02:16.630
...and leave all of England to my tender care?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.100
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.430
If he returns.
And I'll see to it that he doesn't.

02:22.610 --> 02:28.130
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.070
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.680
Tomorrow, Your Highness.

02:45.660 --> 02:48.290
- But who's gonna pay me?
- Pay! Pay!

02:48.460 --> 02:50.360
That's all you Saxons think about.

02:50.530 --> 02:55.160
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John,
who's just come up from London?

03:01.580 --> 03:03.310
Stop! Stop!

03:04.150 --> 03:06.340
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.450
You can't make a slave of him!

03:08.620 --> 03:12.020
Didn't he refuse to send his men
to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?

03:12.190 --> 03:13.990
But I protest...!

03:45.660 --> 03:48.390
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.880
- What's your name, you Saxon dog?
- A better one than yours.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.350
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.190
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.720
- What's your name?
- Much, the miller's son.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.350
- You know it's death to kill the king's deer?
- And death from hunger if I don't.

04:30.530 --> 04:34.090
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.

04:34.270 --> 04:36.240
- Be quiet, you.
- I won't be quiet!

04:36.410 --> 04:39.500
You can kill me if you like,
but not until I've had my say.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.200
You can beat and starve
us Saxons now...

04:42.380 --> 04:45.910
...but when King Richard escapes,
he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...

04:46.080 --> 04:48.280
...and fling you into the sea!

05:00.200 --> 05:02.530
- What the devil?
- Come now, Sir Guy.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.630
- You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
- Lf it amused me, yes.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.900
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.

05:08.070 --> 05:12.440
- By what right do you interfere with justice?
- By a better right than you have to misuse it.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.580
That goes for your master, Prince John.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.650
I'll give him that message at
the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.940
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.750
- Eh, Will?
- Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.080
- Fetch him along.
- Hold there. What's his fault?

05:26.260 --> 05:29.220
- He's killed a royal deer.
- You're wrong. I killed that deer.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.720
This man's my servant.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.320
I suppose you realize the penalty
for killing the king's deer is death.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.900
- Whether for serf or noble.
- Really?

05:39.070 --> 05:41.470
Are there no exceptions?

05:54.780 --> 05:58.150
- Thanks, good master.
- Better look before you shoot next time.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.050
From this day, I follow only you. There
isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...

06:03.230 --> 06:05.790
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.590
Take me as your servant.

06:07.860 --> 06:11.030
Why, in all the forest,
there isn't a hunter as good as me.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.360
I ask no pay.
Just to follow you.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.630
Fetch the deer, then.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.090
While Richard is bent on adventure
in foreign lands...

07:06.260 --> 07:08.820
...it is our duty as Normans
to preserve the realm...

07:08.990 --> 07:13.990
...by giving loyal support to Prince John,
the only true defender of the Norman spirit.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.720
Hail to Prince John.

07:26.740 --> 07:31.680
My lords, I thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:

07:31.850 --> 07:37.290
Good food, good company, and a beautiful
woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.680
Was it worthwhile coming with me
from London...

07:39.860 --> 07:42.420
...to see what stout fellows
our Nottingham friends are?

07:42.590 --> 07:47.260
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our
most renowned defenders of the realm.

07:47.430 --> 07:51.030
- Must I take him, Your Highness?
- Why, you like him, don't you?

07:51.200 --> 07:55.900
- Well, he's a Norman, of course.
- Is that the only reason for liking him?

07:56.070 --> 07:59.300
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward
who must obey her guardian?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.880
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.

08:02.050 --> 08:06.850
But he's our most powerful friend in these
shires and he's already in love with you.

08:07.020 --> 08:12.390
If I could promise him marriage
to a royal ward, it might help my plans.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.150
- Perhaps when I know him better.
- Of course.

08:15.330 --> 08:17.920
You're a very wise young woman.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.930
Any more objections to the new tax
from our Saxon friends?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.500
Objections, Your Highness?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.830
With a Saxon dangling from every
gallows tree between here and Charnwood?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.560
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.

08:30.740 --> 08:35.010
Else we'll have nobody left
to till our land or pay the tax.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.840
There's one exception I'd make,
Your Highness.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.450
- A certain Saxon noble.
- Who is that?

08:40.620 --> 08:46.150
- Sir Robin of Locksley.
- Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?

08:46.320 --> 08:50.350
Why, I've heard precious little else since
I've been here. What's his latest outrage?

08:51.060 --> 08:54.830
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer
in Sherwood Forest today.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.660
And you didn't take him?

08:57.970 --> 08:59.960
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.340
- A Saxon a problem?
- He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.480
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...

09:06.640 --> 09:09.910
...who goes around the shire
stirring up the Saxons against authority.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.780
And he has the insolence to set himself up
as a protector of the people.

09:13.950 --> 09:17.510
- I could have captured him long ago, but...
- But what?

09:17.690 --> 09:21.150
Well, he's the deadliest archer
in England, and...

09:21.320 --> 09:25.920
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham
is afraid of him.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.120
I want him taken and hanged. At once,
do you hear? I'll not tolerate...

09:30.400 --> 09:31.830
Open the door!

09:50.150 --> 09:53.150
Who is this, this...?

09:53.890 --> 09:55.920
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.720
Let him approach.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.570
Greetings, Your Highness.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.210
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.040
I no sooner enter his castle doors
with a piece of meat...

10:22.220 --> 10:25.020
...than his starving servants
try to snatch it from me.

10:25.220 --> 10:28.210
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.

10:28.490 --> 10:31.980
With the compliments of your royal brother,
King Richard, God bless him!

10:32.530 --> 10:36.090
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.

10:36.270 --> 10:39.260
Robin, I like you.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.200
I'm gratified, Your Highness.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.930
I don't think Gisbourne shares
that sentiment, however.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.040
He does look sour.

10:46.610 --> 10:48.980
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?

10:49.150 --> 10:51.770
- I know a ripe subject for one.
- Lf you'll excuse me...

10:51.950 --> 10:54.420
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.610
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.

10:58.390 --> 11:01.520
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey
from London?

11:01.730 --> 11:03.890
What you hope can hardly be important.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.820
What a pity her manners
don't match her looks, Your Highness.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.730
You hear that, gentlemen?

11:10.900 --> 11:14.170
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian
he daren't say "boo" to her...

11:14.340 --> 11:17.640
...and this saucy fellow
gives her better than she sends.

11:17.810 --> 11:22.680
My lords and ladies, I would like to present
to you Sir Robin of Locksley.

11:25.850 --> 11:30.050
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you
your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...

11:30.220 --> 11:34.180
...and our noble guests.
- I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.480
- Have you had meat?
- None but what I brought.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.720
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.

11:38.900 --> 11:42.260
- Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place.
- Your Highness!

11:42.430 --> 11:44.090
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!

11:44.970 --> 11:46.830
Come, Sir lvor.
Out with you.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Bring Sir Robin food at once,
do you hear?

11:50.170 --> 11:53.510
Such impudence must support
a mighty appetite.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.040
True enough, Your Highness.

11:55.210 --> 11:59.810
We Saxons have little to fatten on
by the time your tax gatherers are through.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.240
Be seated, gentlemen. No need
to stand on ceremony on my account.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.660
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?

12:07.820 --> 12:11.320
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off
with a knife, a club or a rope.

12:11.490 --> 12:14.400
- Why, you speak treason.
- Fluently.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.960
I advise you to curb
that wagging tongue of yours!

12:17.200 --> 12:18.860
It's a habit I've never formed.

12:19.040 --> 12:23.230
You know, we Saxons aren't going to
put up with these oppressions much longer.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.570
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:

12:26.880 --> 12:30.970
As you may know, my brother
is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.

12:31.150 --> 12:37.380
And from Leopold, I have received
a ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.

12:37.550 --> 12:40.250
That means that you, my friends...

12:40.420 --> 12:44.590
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks
in the pound, but 3!

12:44.760 --> 12:48.890
- And the money's to be turned over to me.
- Why to you, Your Highness?

12:49.070 --> 12:53.470
- King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
- I've kicked Longchamps out.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.070
From now on, I am regent of England.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.070
Well, confound it,
what are you goggling at?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.980
Is it so strange that I decide to rule
when my brother's a prisoner?

13:07.150 --> 13:08.620
Who's to say I shouldn't?

13:08.790 --> 13:12.380
- You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
- Not I, Your Highness.

13:12.590 --> 13:15.620
- You, Sir Boron?
- Nor I, Your Highness.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.890
- You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
- My sword is yours, Your Highness.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.690
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?

13:26.240 --> 13:29.470
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?

13:29.870 --> 13:32.640
For honest meat, yes.
But I've no stomach for traitors.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.140
- You call me traitor?
- You? Yes.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.710
And every man here
who offers you allegiance.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.920
Your Highness.

13:47.020 --> 13:50.120
What do you call a man who takes advantage
of a king's misfortune...

13:50.290 --> 13:51.560
...to seize his power?

13:51.730 --> 13:54.720
And now, with the help
of this sweet band of cutthroats...

13:54.900 --> 13:58.700
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him
out of every helpless Saxon.

13:58.870 --> 14:04.170
A ransom that'll be used not to release
Richard, but to buy your way to the throne.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.170
Let me ram those words down his throat,
Your Highness!

14:07.340 --> 14:12.340
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.010
And what do you propose to do?

14:19.060 --> 14:23.360
I'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.330
And I'll never rest until every Saxon
in this shire can stand up, free men...

14:27.500 --> 14:29.520
...and strike a blow for Richard and England.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.360
- Have you finished?
- I'm only just beginning.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.990
From this night on, I use every means
in my power to fight you.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.370
Dickon!

15:07.840 --> 15:10.670
Such impudence, Your Highness.
If I could only reach him.

15:15.410 --> 15:17.400
Stand back!
Stand back!

15:47.040 --> 15:48.910
Open the door!

16:23.080 --> 16:26.110
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!

16:26.280 --> 16:28.050
- Shut the door, quick!
- Traitor, sir?

16:48.570 --> 16:51.010
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?

16:51.170 --> 16:52.440
There, through the gate.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.440
- After him!
- Guards! Horses!

16:56.610 --> 16:59.450
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!

18:58.270 --> 18:59.900
Up you go, quick.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.100
Find Crippen
the arrow-maker and his friends...

19:03.270 --> 19:06.240
...to pass the word to every man
who's been beaten or tortured:

19:06.410 --> 19:08.880
- The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
- Yes, master.

19:09.050 --> 19:10.410
Off you go, and good luck.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.870
Have it proclaimed in every village
that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.940
- Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
- Yes, Your Highness.

19:39.110 --> 19:43.410
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.950
Everything he owns.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.910
And just to let the people know
how the wind has changed...

19:50.090 --> 19:54.650
...the sooner you begin collecting the...
- The ransom, Your Highness?

19:55.790 --> 20:00.090
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.

20:04.030 --> 20:07.330
There's a death sentence
for your Robin of Locksley!

20:11.640 --> 20:14.240
I'll have him dangling in a week.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.380
- I'm tired.
- What?

20:21.550 --> 20:25.780
- After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
- I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.930
- Lovely fresh air.
- My teeth ache with chattering.

20:29.090 --> 20:32.590
- Nightingales singing.
- An owl hooting in my ear all night.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.790
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.

20:48.010 --> 20:51.610
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.

20:51.780 --> 20:55.080
By the look of him,
his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.

20:55.250 --> 20:59.150
- Let's see what he's made of.
- It's your skull, not mine.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.330
- Give way, little man.
- Only to a better man than myself.

21:08.770 --> 21:10.230
He stands before you.

21:12.970 --> 21:16.910
Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm
to brawl with such a windbag.

21:17.070 --> 21:20.840
When I've brushed this fly off,
I'll give you a dusting for good measure.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.280
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.

21:23.510 --> 21:27.180
I've only a staff and you threaten me
with a longbow and a goose shaft.

21:27.350 --> 21:31.620
- Aren't you man enough...?
- Wait! I'll get myself a staff.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.230
- Ready?
- Yes.

21:57.810 --> 22:01.440
Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune
that I can make this puny rascal dance to.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.790
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?

22:16.300 --> 22:18.560
If you want a lesson,
you came to the right man!

22:18.770 --> 22:20.830
- Where is he?
- Who?

22:21.100 --> 22:23.940
- This quarterstaff master.
- Here.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.670
Give my compliments to him.

22:25.910 --> 22:30.400
My friend, I should ask payment
for what I'm teaching you here today.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.450
There's something on account.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.280
There's your change.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.650
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?

23:04.820 --> 23:08.010
- John Little. What's yours?
- Robin.

23:08.190 --> 23:10.280
- Not Robin of Locksley?
- Aye.

23:10.450 --> 23:14.320
- Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
- 'Twas he who did the falling in.

23:15.860 --> 23:19.890
I wanted to see what you were made of.
And I did.

23:20.330 --> 23:22.890
- I hope you'll not hold it against me.
- On the contrary.

23:23.070 --> 23:26.000
- I love a man that can best me.
- I'd like to join your company.

23:26.170 --> 23:31.300
You shall. If you can hold a breach like you
held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.670
- This is Will of Gamwell.
- Yeah.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.410
- He took good care not to wet his feathers.
- Just brain over brawn, friend.

23:38.920 --> 23:43.080
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.660
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is
declared an outlaw, condemned to death."

23:50.830 --> 23:55.320
- Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
- "Any person aiding him will be hanged."

23:55.500 --> 23:57.660
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.230
Robin in Sherwood.

24:01.410 --> 24:03.070
At the Gallows Oak.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.330
Robin in Sherwood.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.840
Robin. Gallows Oak.

24:10.050 --> 24:11.950
Gallows Oak.

24:14.350 --> 24:18.220
I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen,
loyal to our king.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.580
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.020
But since Prince John has seized
the regency...

24:23.190 --> 24:26.490
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors
have murdered and pillaged.

24:26.660 --> 24:30.260
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...

24:30.430 --> 24:33.340
...the blindings with hot irons,
the burning of our homes...

24:33.500 --> 24:36.560
...the mistreatment of our women.
It's time we put an end to this!

24:36.740 --> 24:39.300
- Robin's right.
- Aye!

24:39.880 --> 24:41.280
Now, this forest is wide.

24:41.450 --> 24:44.210
It can shelter, clothe and feed
a band of good, determined men...

24:44.380 --> 24:46.820
...good swordsmen, good archers,
good fighters!

24:46.980 --> 24:51.390
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people,
I want you. Are you with me?

24:51.560 --> 24:53.080
Aye! Aye!

24:53.590 --> 24:56.150
Then kneel and swear this oath.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.800
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear
to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.

25:03.970 --> 25:09.230
To shelter the old and helpless, to protect
all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.

25:09.410 --> 25:11.400
Swear to fight for a free England.

25:11.580 --> 25:15.880
To protect her loyally until the return of our
king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.

25:16.050 --> 25:18.570
And swear to fight to the death
against our oppressors!

25:18.750 --> 25:21.680
We do!
We do solemnly swear!

25:42.170 --> 25:44.200
String him up again!

25:45.380 --> 25:48.780
- He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
- Oh, he'll die, will he?

25:48.950 --> 25:52.470
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.380
Continue!

26:01.590 --> 26:06.190
- Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
- Start him dancing!

26:19.440 --> 26:22.670
This will teach you to defy Prince John!

26:25.880 --> 26:28.540
Father! Father!

26:32.320 --> 26:34.020
Stop!

26:42.800 --> 26:46.830
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.440
- You don't have to name them.
- Our men can't lay a hot iron...

26:49.610 --> 26:53.370
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting
an arrow in the throat. It's an outrage!

26:53.540 --> 26:55.910
- He's got to be stopped!
- Have you tried to stop him?

26:56.680 --> 26:58.200
Yes, but I couldn't find him.

26:59.380 --> 27:03.790
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.920
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief
in the shire is joining him.

27:07.090 --> 27:10.030
I've sent spies in the forest
to find out his hiding place...

27:10.190 --> 27:14.690
...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
- While you stay safely at home.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.490
Do you question my valor?
Am I not personally commanding the force...

27:18.670 --> 27:21.300
...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian
to Kenworth Castle...

27:21.470 --> 27:24.530
...to guard the tax money he is bringing back,
with my sword and my life?

27:24.710 --> 27:28.240
I only hope this murderer
does come out of his hiding place.

27:28.410 --> 27:29.780
You hope!

27:31.750 --> 27:36.910
Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this outlaw
by the heels when I get back.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.450
Well, well.
A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.

28:09.620 --> 28:12.280
- He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
- Be careful, Robin.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.690
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted...

28:14.860 --> 28:17.830
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.

28:17.990 --> 28:21.190
A humble soul, he is,
with a heart as gentle as a lamb.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.130
- Be easy with him, master.
- Oh, I won't harm him.

28:24.300 --> 28:28.070
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.

28:29.110 --> 28:31.870
But that friar's one of the most
dangerous swordsmen...

29:17.720 --> 29:20.280
Bless my soul, a miracle!

29:27.600 --> 29:30.860
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!

29:34.570 --> 29:38.770
If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.610
If this is poverty,
I'll gladly share it with you.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.770
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!

29:44.950 --> 29:47.680
Not so close, my ponderous one.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.910
- I'd have a word with you.
- Well?

29:50.090 --> 29:54.390
I live in the forest with good fellows who've
everything in life save spiritual guidance.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.920
And no merit but one.

29:56.090 --> 29:58.430
- And what's that?
- We're outlaws.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.520
Since we're newborn to the greenwood,
we need someone to do our christenings.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.670
- So we've chosen you.
- Not I.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.800
- They've probably all got your taking ways.
- Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.470
Now, friar, let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.

30:15.950 --> 30:18.470
- Come.
- I'll not. I'm happy here.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.710
You will come.

30:22.050 --> 30:26.080
Now then, since I don't care to get my feet
wet, you'll carry me across on your back.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.390
- On my back?
- Bend! You must learn obedience.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.990
Come on, bend.

30:41.470 --> 30:43.340
On, now!

30:48.050 --> 30:52.610
Come on! On! On! Faster!
I'll have a gallop from you yet.

31:16.310 --> 31:20.870
Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.

31:21.410 --> 31:25.870
After I let a little air into your bellows
you'll whistle a different tune.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.080
By Our Lady,
you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.080
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.

32:02.250 --> 32:05.090
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me
by half a leg of mutton.

32:05.260 --> 32:07.750
- So...
- No. Hold there, friar. Enough.

32:07.930 --> 32:12.420
Come with me and I'll promise you the finest
venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate.

32:12.600 --> 32:17.030
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.430
If you'd said that before, you'd have saved
us both a wetting. Come along.

32:22.610 --> 32:23.970
- You'll join us?
- Aye.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.840
If only to convert you
from your thieving ways.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.720
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?

32:31.880 --> 32:34.540
The holy henchman!

32:34.720 --> 32:37.550
Hail, doubting friar!

32:38.690 --> 32:39.880
- Robin.
- Aye?

32:40.060 --> 32:41.350
He's well named Friar Tuck.

32:41.530 --> 32:45.260
It would take half the deer
in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.

32:46.100 --> 32:49.360
And twice that to fill your empty head.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.440
- Whoa, Will!
- What news, Will?

32:57.110 --> 32:59.370
- I've got word...
- It's all right. He's one of us.

32:59.540 --> 33:02.270
One of us?
He looks like three of us.

33:02.450 --> 33:04.910
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.080
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?

33:09.250 --> 33:12.050
Sir Guy of Gisbourne
is stopping by the way tonight.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.990
- Has he got the tax money?
- A fortune!

33:14.160 --> 33:16.490
- When does he enter Sherwood?
- Tomorrow.

33:16.660 --> 33:20.560
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match
I promised, but it'll be double tomorrow!

33:20.730 --> 33:23.960
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.950
- Are you ready, men?
- Aye.

34:08.150 --> 34:11.440
- See anything of them?
- Not yet.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.740
Is everything ready?

34:13.920 --> 34:17.320
They'll think they've got into
a blooming hornet's nest.

34:21.830 --> 34:23.050
There they come.

34:43.250 --> 34:46.080
- Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
- What for?

34:46.250 --> 34:48.410
Well, this is Sherwood, you know,
and Robin Hood...

34:48.590 --> 34:52.610
- Afraid of that gallows-face?
- Afraid? Certainly not, sir.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.690
But it's here that he's boldest.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.490
Don't worry.
We're more than enough to take care of him.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.560
Outlaws have no face to show themselves
against armed troops.

35:02.730 --> 35:05.130
Are you sure?
I seem to remember...

35:05.300 --> 35:09.200
Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small
parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.

35:09.370 --> 35:13.330
- Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
- Make ready. They're in two sections.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.740
- Do you see Sir Guy?
- He's leading the second.

35:15.950 --> 35:17.470
The treasure wagon is with him.

35:43.740 --> 35:46.470
Sir Guy and the sheriff
are watering their horses.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.130
- The advance guard's far ahead.
- Good. Little John!

35:49.310 --> 35:52.810
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.510
Personally!

35:54.750 --> 35:57.650
- Ready, men?
- Aye, Robin!

35:57.820 --> 36:02.760
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.

37:02.950 --> 37:05.220
- Look!
- The guard! Quick!

37:52.470 --> 37:54.200
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.930
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.

38:00.110 --> 38:03.910
I've often heard that you'd give me a warm
welcome if ever we met again.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.940
- You're permitting this insolence without...?
- Fighting?

38:08.120 --> 38:12.080
- I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
- Well, I have, you impudent rascal!

38:12.260 --> 38:14.920
You're not going to harm my lamb,
my honeysuckle.

38:15.090 --> 38:16.390
Be still, Bess.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.220
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.130
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.390
- We won't harm him much.
- You see?

38:25.570 --> 38:27.700
Well, let's away.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.590
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...

38:49.760 --> 38:52.660
...to find our camp again.
- You'll hang for this, all of you.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.860
A small price to pay for the company
of such a charming lady.

38:56.030 --> 38:59.630
What can a Saxon hedge-robber
know of charm? Or ladies?

38:59.800 --> 39:02.000
- She means you.
- Me? A hedge-robber?

39:02.170 --> 39:05.230
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.570
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting
enough to bother about.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.550
You just harm one hair
of my lady's head...

39:13.720 --> 39:18.950
...and that ugly face of yours will walk
about with no neck under it. Now, mind!

39:19.120 --> 39:21.990
- What are you staring at?
- I ain't never been out walking...

39:22.160 --> 39:24.220
...with a female before.
- What female?

39:24.390 --> 39:28.190
- You.
- Well, of all the impudence!

39:28.430 --> 39:31.130
I suppose you say that to all women
that tickle your fancy.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.740
I've never tickled
a woman's fancy before.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.870
No, I've never had a sweetheart.

39:36.710 --> 39:41.580
Do you mean to say you never had one single
sweetheart in all your life?

39:43.310 --> 39:45.300
You don't know what you missed,
my lad.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.780
I've had the bands on five times.

40:08.240 --> 40:11.040
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.

40:11.210 --> 40:13.900
- I won't!
- You will!

40:14.080 --> 40:15.410
I will! I will!

40:25.090 --> 40:26.560
To them, this is heaven.

40:26.720 --> 40:31.560
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches,
limitless food instead of hunger.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.600
- Why, they're actually happy.
- Are they?

40:34.770 --> 40:37.930
Aren't you even a little pleased
to see them enjoying themselves?

40:38.100 --> 40:40.040
I think it's revolting.

40:41.310 --> 40:45.830
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it,
my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.

40:46.010 --> 40:51.680
But if you could know these people as I know
them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.580
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.

41:01.860 --> 41:06.390
Me lord. Here is your raiment
for the banquet.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.860
When you've done with them,
give them to Prince John.

41:11.140 --> 41:14.430
To the tables, everybody,
and stuff yourselves!

41:20.650 --> 41:22.170
May I serve you, my lady?

41:22.350 --> 41:24.750
I'm afraid the company
has spoiled my appetite.

41:24.920 --> 41:28.280
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.

41:45.470 --> 41:48.500
- A little mutton, my lady?
- I said I'm not hungry.

41:48.670 --> 41:50.470
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.

41:50.640 --> 41:55.010
Well, you will let me know
if you regain your appetite, won't you?

42:28.710 --> 42:31.440
Friends! Friends!

42:31.620 --> 42:35.420
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy
of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...

42:35.590 --> 42:37.920
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!

42:38.090 --> 42:40.150
He provides us with this tasty supper.

42:44.900 --> 42:48.020
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!

42:48.200 --> 42:53.540
For in his train today he's brought us half
a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...

42:53.700 --> 42:58.900
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks
wrested from the northern shires.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.040
- You wouldn't dare.
- Sit down!

43:04.320 --> 43:09.180
Some of you might think our host intended
this treasure for the coffers of Prince John...

43:09.350 --> 43:12.250
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.

43:12.420 --> 43:14.480
But a strange thing happened.

43:14.660 --> 43:20.330
A change of heart overtook him in the forest,
and there it is, safe and sound!

43:25.800 --> 43:28.360
- You speak of loyalty.
- Yes. Why not?

43:28.540 --> 43:32.240
I suppose you and your cutthroats
intend to send this treasure to Richard?

43:32.410 --> 43:35.350
You wouldn't dream
of keeping it yourselves.

43:36.980 --> 43:41.420
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?

43:41.590 --> 43:44.180
- Hold it for Richard!
- It belongs to the king!

43:53.060 --> 43:56.760
- Convinced?
- I may have been hasty...

43:57.440 --> 44:02.930
But why you, a knight, should live here
like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...?

44:03.110 --> 44:05.870
Are you really interested in learning
why I turned outlaw?

44:06.080 --> 44:08.600
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?

44:09.110 --> 44:14.310
- I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
- Good. Then come with me.

44:14.490 --> 44:16.580
Oh, so you are afraid.

44:29.330 --> 44:31.390
- Well, men.
- Hi!

44:44.920 --> 44:49.510
Hardly an inspiring sight
for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.

44:50.150 --> 44:52.990
But these poor devils
have all had their homes burned.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.460
Their families beaten and starved to death
by your tax gatherers.

44:56.630 --> 45:00.220
- Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you.
- Our humble thanks, master.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.770
- May we be worthy, Robin.
- You are, mother, you are.

45:03.940 --> 45:06.670
- Have you eaten well, friend?
- Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.240
We humbly thank you, master.

45:12.610 --> 45:17.810
I'm sorry to have to show you that. But once
these poor people were happy and contented.

45:17.980 --> 45:20.680
Just simple villagers
who never harmed a soul.

45:20.850 --> 45:26.880
And now... Tortured, eyes put out,
tongues slit, ears hacked off.

45:27.860 --> 45:32.690
They come to me for protection
against your Norman friends.

45:33.830 --> 45:36.100
But you've taken Norman lives.

45:36.270 --> 45:39.240
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.840
You're a strange man.

45:42.010 --> 45:45.810
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten,
helpless people?

45:45.980 --> 45:48.970
No, you're strange because you want
to do something about it.

45:49.150 --> 45:53.880
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince
John himself. To risk your own life.

45:54.050 --> 45:58.280
- And one of those men was a Norman.
- Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?

45:58.460 --> 46:02.860
- It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
- But it's lost you your rank, your lands.

46:03.030 --> 46:07.190
It's made you a hunted outlaw, when
you might have lived in comfort and security.

46:07.370 --> 46:09.200
What's your reward for all this?

46:10.270 --> 46:14.530
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?

46:15.740 --> 46:17.070
I'm sorry.

46:17.980 --> 46:21.600
I do begin to see a little now.

46:22.880 --> 46:27.250
If you do, then that's reward enough.

46:47.610 --> 46:51.200
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill
of insulting us, we wish to leave.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.540
- Come, Lady Marian.
- My men will escort my lady.

46:53.710 --> 46:57.610
But before you take leave, it might be well
if you thanked her for saving your life.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.040
My life?

46:59.220 --> 47:03.450
Do you think you would have left this forest
alive if it hadn't been for her presence here?

47:04.490 --> 47:05.790
- Peter! Harold!
- Yes, master?

47:05.960 --> 47:10.590
Take six men and guide our loyal host and
his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.250
But our horses, our clothes.

47:13.430 --> 47:16.030
You'll return to Nottingham
as you are, on foot.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.930
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you
in humility, if not in mercy.

47:20.100 --> 47:23.040
- Your people will be returned tomorrow.
- But the lady Marian.

47:23.210 --> 47:26.180
You'd best be started
before I have a change of mind.

47:28.450 --> 47:30.680
I think we'd better go.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.880
Now, my lady.

47:39.460 --> 47:41.860
Friar Tuck! Little John!

47:46.860 --> 47:49.260
Take the lady
to the Abbey of the Black Canons...

47:49.430 --> 47:52.530
...so tomorrow the bishop
can give her escort the rest of the way.

47:52.700 --> 47:56.570
- May I go too?
- With your permission, my lady?

48:08.850 --> 48:10.820
Goodbye, my lady.

48:11.190 --> 48:12.780
Goodbye.

48:30.970 --> 48:33.600
- He took everything you had collected?
- Every silver penny.

48:33.770 --> 48:36.440
And you two nincompoops sat there
and let him do it.

48:36.610 --> 48:41.410
- Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
- Where are your wounds? Your bruises?

48:41.580 --> 48:44.180
- And where are your men?
- What did Your Highness expect?

48:44.350 --> 48:47.620
With the Lady Marian in our company
and Locksley's men outnumbering us.

48:47.790 --> 48:50.350
And not an arrow wound to divide
among them, I suppose.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.720
And more than 30,000 marks
in the hands of that wolf's head.

48:53.890 --> 48:56.620
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?

48:56.800 --> 48:59.200
And how does Your Highness suggest
that he be taken?

48:59.370 --> 49:03.360
- Lf I may be so bold as to inquire?
- Mind your words, Gisbourne.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.900
You're fortunate not to be paying
for this with your head.

49:07.070 --> 49:11.570
Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army
and surround Sherwood.

49:12.110 --> 49:14.380
- You couldn't capture him...
- You mind your words.

49:14.550 --> 49:17.210
...if he sat in your lap
shooting arrows at a crow.

49:17.420 --> 49:18.650
Arrows!

49:18.820 --> 49:22.980
- He said shooting arrows at a crow.
- Take that silly looking bonnet off.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.820
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.

49:26.990 --> 49:30.050
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...

49:30.230 --> 49:31.790
- But what?
- We'll outwit him.

49:31.970 --> 49:33.900
We'll hold an archery tournament!

49:34.070 --> 49:35.400
Archery tour...

49:35.570 --> 49:39.900
And have him fly in on the end of one
of his own arrows? That's marvelous.

49:40.070 --> 49:42.970
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...

49:43.140 --> 49:46.810
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.

49:46.980 --> 49:49.610
And ask him to risk his neck for that?

49:49.780 --> 49:54.690
That won't be the only bait, with
the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.

49:55.490 --> 49:56.720
What do you mean?

49:56.890 --> 50:00.020
When they came out of the forest,
she seemed very friendly.

50:00.190 --> 50:02.790
And didn't you notice
how his eyes never left her?

50:02.960 --> 50:04.760
- Yes, yes, I noticed.
- Well, then!

50:04.930 --> 50:08.200
- Well, then, how do we get word to him?
- Get word to Robin...

50:08.370 --> 50:10.930
...who has an eye in every bush
and ears in every wall?

50:11.100 --> 50:13.400
But even if he comes,
won't he be disguised?

50:13.570 --> 50:17.570
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar,
knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal...

50:17.740 --> 50:19.270
...the finest archer in England?

50:19.450 --> 50:22.440
The man who wins the golden arrow
will be Robin Hood.

50:22.620 --> 50:25.240
Will you take that bonnet off?

51:13.270 --> 51:15.670
I hope our little golden hook
will catch the fish.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.000
- You hope?
- Oh, it will if he's here.

51:18.170 --> 51:22.580
If he's not, we'll stick your head
upon the target and shoot at that.

51:22.740 --> 51:24.510
- Are your men sure of their orders?
- Yes.

51:24.680 --> 51:28.310
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.110
You talk as if this were a trap.

51:30.290 --> 51:36.250
Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case
the Saxons create a disturbance.

51:40.230 --> 51:46.570
By orders of His Highness Prince John, the
champions of Sir Guy and the knights...

51:46.730 --> 51:51.190
...will be limited to three flights of arrows
for the eliminations.

51:51.370 --> 51:55.540
The winning team will meet all comers.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.530
- You know it's a trap.
- A golden arrow, from the lady herself.

52:19.700 --> 52:23.160
- They've cooked up this thing to take you.
- Well, what of it?

52:23.340 --> 52:26.360
- You know what'll happen if they do.
- Where's your sporting blood?

52:26.540 --> 52:29.480
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.

52:29.640 --> 52:34.670
- It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
- There, my band getting fat and overfed.

52:34.850 --> 52:36.980
Where's your love of fights,
risk, adventure?

52:37.150 --> 52:41.490
Well, since our friend seems to have gone
a little mad, I'll have to see him through.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.590
We'll have to see him through.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.500
Prepare final flight.

53:03.440 --> 53:07.440
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?

53:07.620 --> 53:10.020
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I asked if you found it interesting.

53:10.180 --> 53:13.920
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.

53:14.090 --> 53:16.450
You'll find it much more
interesting later on.

53:22.260 --> 53:26.790
The winning team will compete
as individuals.

53:26.970 --> 53:29.990
Captain Phillip of Arras.

53:30.170 --> 53:34.800
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.

53:34.980 --> 53:38.100
They now challenge all comers.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.580
The men who'd shoot against that lot
have to have the eyes of a falcon.

53:41.750 --> 53:44.380
They're far too good for me.
I'm not shooting today.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.920
Remaining archers will use
center target.

55:10.470 --> 55:12.200
Matt of Sleaford, out!

55:12.370 --> 55:15.140
Elwyn the Welshman, out!

55:22.550 --> 55:24.420
- The tall tinker.
- Now is the time.

55:24.590 --> 55:28.110
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.

55:28.290 --> 55:31.450
- But he could...
- Have your men close in if you wish.

55:37.570 --> 55:38.860
Look.

55:39.030 --> 55:41.430
Yeah, they're closing in.
I hope Robin sees them.

55:52.850 --> 55:55.780
I must commend Your Highness
for the subtlety of your scheme.

56:10.000 --> 56:16.200
Very good. Would you say you'd seen
that tall fellow before?

56:16.370 --> 56:19.600
And if I had, what interest
could a tinker have for me?

56:19.770 --> 56:21.970
Phillip of Arras shoots next.

56:25.680 --> 56:28.480
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.

56:28.650 --> 56:33.680
Target's a deal too close. Can we have
it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?

56:35.790 --> 56:37.490
Another 20 paces!

56:41.300 --> 56:45.760
If your archer captain wins at that distance,
I'll give you 1000 gold marks for him.

56:45.930 --> 56:48.990
Win or lose, I'll give him
to Your Highness for a favor.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.440
Provided you let me deal
with this wolf's head in my own way.

56:52.610 --> 56:56.810
Done. I'm leaving for Norwich immediately
after the tournament anyway...

56:56.980 --> 56:59.170
...so you may do what you please
with him.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.650
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.

57:06.820 --> 57:09.980
I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!

57:17.160 --> 57:18.860
He split Phillip's arrow.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.300
The tinker wins! He wins!

57:41.060 --> 57:45.010
- What is your name, archer?
- Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.

57:45.190 --> 57:48.890
How is it that a tinker learned so well
the use of arms?

57:49.060 --> 57:54.970
Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself
these days from treachery and other things.

57:55.140 --> 57:57.970
It's earned you more
than you bargained for today.

57:59.070 --> 58:01.410
I pronounce you champion archer
of England.

58:01.580 --> 58:06.640
And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.

58:10.650 --> 58:12.210
Advance.

58:22.630 --> 58:26.730
I... Here is your prize, sir archer.

58:26.900 --> 58:31.400
It's indeed an honor to receive it
from the hands of so beautiful a lady.

58:31.940 --> 58:36.240
- How is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
- That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.

58:36.410 --> 58:39.900
- Its verdict is always final.
- Arrest this man!

59:26.060 --> 59:28.120
That's a good idea.

59:30.930 --> 59:32.660
You're a very rash young man.

59:32.830 --> 59:36.670
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham
to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.830
- It'll be something special, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.

59:40.010 --> 59:42.340
Sorry I underestimated you.
Next time perhaps...

59:42.510 --> 59:45.070
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!

1:00:15.340 --> 1:00:19.510
"Robin of Locksley.
Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:22.910
After trial, in which you did not produce
one witness in your behalf...

1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:26.080
...you've been found guilty of outlawry,
theft, murder, abduction...

1:00:26.250 --> 1:00:30.420
...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown,
poaching in royal forests and high treason."

1:00:30.590 --> 1:00:32.530
Haven't you forgotten
a count or two?

1:00:32.990 --> 1:00:36.330
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:39.190
To protect serfs from injustice
and be loyal to one's king.

1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:44.400
If I could add anything to the charges
against you, I would most gladly do so.

1:00:44.570 --> 1:00:48.130
"It is the sentence of this tribunal,
on the morrow at high noon you be taken...

1:00:48.310 --> 1:00:52.580
...to the square in Nottingham and there
hanged by the neck until you are dead."

1:00:54.650 --> 1:00:58.450
There may be some who will regret
that a man of your peculiar talents...

1:00:58.620 --> 1:01:00.880
...should be cut off so early in life.
But personally...

1:01:01.060 --> 1:01:04.580
You think the sentence extremely lenient.
Thank you.

1:02:11.630 --> 1:02:14.360
What's troubling you, my lady?
Is it the outlaw?

1:02:15.430 --> 1:02:20.030
Yes. I hate to see a human
being trapped...

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:24.030
Bess, you know where his men
may be found, don't you?

1:02:24.210 --> 1:02:26.640
- Why, my lady, how should I know?
- Don't put me off.

1:02:26.810 --> 1:02:29.780
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?

1:02:29.950 --> 1:02:31.710
- Yes, my lady.
- Tell me where.

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:34.210
- Do you want to send a message?
- To his men, yes.

1:02:34.380 --> 1:02:37.650
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale
of a night, just now and again...

1:02:37.820 --> 1:02:41.590
...at a place in the town and I won't deny
as some of the others were there.

1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:45.780
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!

1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:51.760
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.

1:02:51.930 --> 1:02:54.460
- The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
- Humility Prin.

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:57.370
- Knock at the door and say, "A Locksley."
- "A Locksley."

1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:00.170
- Yes, but...
- Get me a cloak, quickly!

1:03:00.340 --> 1:03:03.110
Yes, madame.
Oh, dear...

1:03:07.020 --> 1:03:10.540
- But there must be some way...
- lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:13.850
Why, you'd need an army
with a battering ram to even dent it.

1:03:14.020 --> 1:03:16.050
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.

1:03:16.220 --> 1:03:18.720
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we should...

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:23.990
A Locksley.

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:38.710
- What is it, Prin?
- A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.

1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:43.010
- What?
- It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:45.180
She has the password, all right.

1:03:45.350 --> 1:03:47.450
- Is she alone?
- Yes, sir.

1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:49.250
Fetch her in.

1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:07.670
- What do you want, my lady?
- I want to help him.

1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:11.610
- How did you find us here?
- Never mind that now.

1:04:13.150 --> 1:04:16.120
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what I can do.

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.980
- Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick.
- Would I come here alone if it were a trap?

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:24.960
What's to prevent your killing me if...? Is
there no one here with sense enough to see?

1:04:25.130 --> 1:04:26.680
One moment.

1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:31.620
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?

1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:35.500
You swear by Our Lady
that you want to help Robin?

1:04:35.670 --> 1:04:37.300
I swear, good Father.

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:39.260
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes.

1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:42.670
- Can you get us in the castle?
- That's no good. He's heavily guarded.

1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:44.710
But I thought of another way.
Listen.

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:19.300
- This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
- Yes, isn't it?

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.210
With Locksley out of the way,
we'll stamp out the rest.

1:05:22.620 --> 1:05:26.880
Won't it be a pleasant surprise
for Prince John when he returns?

1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.820
And to think that I was once foolish enough
to believe that you rather liked him.

1:05:33.090 --> 1:05:35.220
Why, your hand is trembling.

1:06:15.070 --> 1:06:17.300
Take him to the gallows.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:27.140
Take him up there.

1:07:01.950 --> 1:07:05.580
He'll not be so insolent
when they've stretched his neck.

1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.320
Get ready.

1:07:23.710 --> 1:07:25.370
Stop him!

1:07:55.540 --> 1:07:57.510
Stop! Guards!

1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:11.850
Friar Tuck! Much!

1:08:12.020 --> 1:08:14.320
- Here we are, sir!
- Here we are, safe and sound!

1:08:14.490 --> 1:08:16.080
Back to camp!

1:08:38.110 --> 1:08:40.410
Robin! Where are you?

1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:44.140
Here I am. Stand by!

1:09:29.130 --> 1:09:31.390
He is different from anyone I've ever known.

1:09:31.570 --> 1:09:36.830
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless,
and yet he's gentle and kind.

1:09:37.010 --> 1:09:38.840
He's not brutal like...

1:09:39.010 --> 1:09:43.380
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...

1:09:43.540 --> 1:09:46.380
...well, is it hard to think of anybody
but one person?

1:09:46.550 --> 1:09:49.380
Yes, indeed, and sometimes
there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

1:09:49.550 --> 1:09:52.210
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.

1:09:52.390 --> 1:09:54.480
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.

1:09:54.660 --> 1:09:58.850
Not that I've noticed it's done that to you,
except when he was waiting to be hanged.

1:09:59.030 --> 1:10:01.330
Does it make you want
to be with him all the time?

1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:05.760
Yes. And when he's with you,
your legs are weak as water.

1:10:05.930 --> 1:10:10.270
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you,
do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:14.530
...like goosy pimples running
all up and down your spine?

1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:17.610
- Then there's not a doubt of it.
- Doubt of what?

1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:19.680
That you're in love!

1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:23.510
What do you want?

1:10:24.350 --> 1:10:25.610
Robin!

1:10:25.790 --> 1:10:29.550
- I must say. I must say!
- Keep quiet, Bess.

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.720
Are you completely mad?

1:10:31.890 --> 1:10:33.990
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:35.460
But don't you realize that...?

1:10:35.630 --> 1:10:38.460
My men told me what you did for me,
so I've come to thank you.

1:10:38.630 --> 1:10:42.190
And after what I couldn't help overhearing
about that prickly feeling...

1:10:42.370 --> 1:10:43.740
...l'm very glad I did come.

1:10:43.910 --> 1:10:47.240
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:50.140
A game?
Well, couldn't I join in?

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.780
Of course, I probably wouldn't be
as good at it as this pretty young girl.

1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:57.880
But I could do my best.

1:10:58.050 --> 1:10:59.380
Bess, will you leave us?

1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:02.610
Please!

1:11:13.740 --> 1:11:16.230
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:20.400
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.

1:11:20.580 --> 1:11:24.380
You are, aren't you?
Because I am with you, terribly.

1:11:24.550 --> 1:11:27.210
That's why I came.
I had to see you again.

1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:29.750
You must go at once.
And I don't love you.

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.910
- Oh! Are you sure?
- Yes.

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:37.490
Very well then, I'll go.

1:11:39.890 --> 1:11:44.420
You know, this is rather unfriendly of you,
exposing me to my enemies like this.

1:11:45.670 --> 1:11:50.430
Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain
of the guard down there with bow legs.

1:11:50.610 --> 1:11:52.800
If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse.

1:11:52.970 --> 1:11:55.640
An archer! He's too thin.
I might miss him altogether.

1:11:55.810 --> 1:11:57.610
- Robin!
- The very thing.

1:11:57.780 --> 1:12:00.710
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:02.410
- Goodbye, my lady!
- Robin!

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:04.070
- Yes?
- Please.

1:12:04.250 --> 1:12:06.020
Then you do love me? Don't you?

1:12:06.190 --> 1:12:08.160
- Don't you?
- You know I do.

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:10.350
Well, that's different.

1:12:23.870 --> 1:12:26.340
- Do you know you're very impudent?
- Me?

1:12:26.510 --> 1:12:27.500
You are!

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:31.270
When my guardian, King Richard,
finds out about your being in love with me...

1:12:31.450 --> 1:12:33.780
- I know, he'll make me court jester.
- He won't!

1:12:33.950 --> 1:12:36.040
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.

1:12:36.220 --> 1:12:38.910
And a fine decoration it will be,
my bold Norman beauty.

1:12:39.090 --> 1:12:40.990
- I'm not bold.
- Well, you're Norman.

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:45.060
Well, I don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.

1:12:45.230 --> 1:12:47.660
- You're the most beautiful...
- You're leaving at once.

1:12:47.830 --> 1:12:50.700
Please, darling, every minute
you're here you're in danger.

1:12:50.870 --> 1:12:52.060
I'll go.

1:12:52.230 --> 1:12:56.900
- Marian, will you come with me?
- To Sherwood?

1:12:57.070 --> 1:13:01.670
I've nothing to offer you but a life of
hardship and danger, but we'd be together.

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:05.070
- But, Robin, dear...
- I know. It's asking a lot, but who knows...

1:13:05.250 --> 1:13:10.480
...how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?

1:13:10.650 --> 1:13:12.920
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.

1:13:13.090 --> 1:13:15.650
Even the danger would mean nothing
if you were with me.

1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:16.980
Then you will?

1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:20.960
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?

1:13:21.130 --> 1:13:24.720
I realized then for the first time
that what you were doing was right...

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.160
...and that we were wrong.

1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:27.600
No, let me finish.

1:13:27.770 --> 1:13:30.470
You taught me England
is bigger than Normans and Saxons...

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.270
...fighting and hating each other.

1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:35.210
That it belongs to all of us,
to live peacefully together...

1:13:35.380 --> 1:13:37.240
...loyal only to Richard and to England.

1:13:37.410 --> 1:13:39.210
But, darling, you could help.

1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:42.250
I could help much more
by watching for treachery here...

1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:46.080
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:49.690
Now do you see why
you have to go back to your men alone?

1:14:09.510 --> 1:14:12.450
Go now, quickly, dearest.

1:14:13.350 --> 1:14:16.320
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.

1:14:32.630 --> 1:14:35.690
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.

1:15:05.830 --> 1:15:10.130
- You gentlemen have traveled far?
- Yes, quite a distance.

1:15:10.310 --> 1:15:13.300
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.

1:15:14.810 --> 1:15:18.510
- There is little left to us these days.
- This will be enough.

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:21.340
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?

1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:24.350
That's a Norman inn.

1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:32.160
But it's an outrage!
I'll complain to Prince John.

1:15:32.330 --> 1:15:36.460
I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!

1:15:36.630 --> 1:15:38.600
Strip my person of jewels!

1:15:38.770 --> 1:15:42.790
What's this country coming to when a high
churchman can't travel the forest in safety?

1:15:42.970 --> 1:15:46.130
- Who's he?
- The Bishop of the Black Canons.

1:15:46.310 --> 1:15:49.710
- Do you wish to go on after dinner?
- No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.

1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:52.110
- I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
- Yes, Your Grace.

1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:54.370
- Bring food to us!
- Yes, Your Grace, at once!

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:58.180
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.

1:15:58.350 --> 1:16:01.190
- What happened, Your Grace?
- I told you! We've been robbed.

1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:04.790
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:07.330
- Who did?
- Why, Robin Hood, of course.

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:09.290
There's no other with impudence enough.

1:16:09.460 --> 1:16:11.360
Robin Hood again, sire.

1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:17.660
- You've heard of him, then?
- Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:23.780
- Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
- More or less.

1:16:23.950 --> 1:16:25.850
What might be your names, gentlemen?

1:16:26.010 --> 1:16:28.740
They're hardly important enough
to deserve your interest.

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:31.910
- Landlord, where's our ale?
- Coming, sirs.

1:16:32.090 --> 1:16:34.180
Will you gentlemen
be remaining here tonight?

1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:37.760
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?

1:16:37.930 --> 1:16:42.090
Well, there's so much danger on the road,
you'd be far safer here.

1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:46.060
We will then, since we'll have
the added pleasure of your company.

1:16:46.230 --> 1:16:51.370
Well, I should really like to stay, but I
recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.

1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:55.640
Some other time, or perhaps you would break
your journey and sup with me tomorrow.

1:16:55.810 --> 1:16:56.940
Your Grace is too kind.

1:16:57.110 --> 1:17:00.670
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen,
and God speed you in the morning.

1:17:00.850 --> 1:17:02.780
Thank you. Good night.

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:12.190
The window!

1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:18.660
Are there beds prepared, landlord?

1:17:18.830 --> 1:17:22.530
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.

1:17:26.910 --> 1:17:30.280
- I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
- I fear so.

1:17:30.450 --> 1:17:34.810
His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear
on the landlord's face when he came in?

1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:37.950
I've seen it in the faces
of thousands since we returned.

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:40.110
I ought never to have left England.

1:17:40.290 --> 1:17:42.350
I noticed when Robin Hood's
name is mentioned...

1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:44.460
The mysterious outlaw
whom we have sought.

1:17:44.630 --> 1:17:48.930
In vain. However, the bishop
didn't have any difficulty meeting him.

1:17:49.100 --> 1:17:50.500
Which gives me an idea.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.400
- And you're sure it was Richard?
- No doubt of it.

1:17:54.570 --> 1:17:56.590
How like my dear brother this is!

1:17:56.770 --> 1:18:00.140
He couldn't rot in Durnstein
like any decent man.

1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:03.940
- But Richard has no army.
- No, Your Highness.

1:18:04.110 --> 1:18:07.980
- Lf he had, we should have heard of it.
- Lf my brother happened to be killed...

1:18:08.150 --> 1:18:11.310
- England would have a new king.
- That would be murder! I'll have no part...

1:18:11.490 --> 1:18:15.420
You'll do as you're told!
That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed.

1:18:15.590 --> 1:18:16.920
Your Highness, I beg of you!

1:18:17.090 --> 1:18:20.990
How long will you retain your abbey
if Richard survives to find out...

1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:24.160
...what you've been up to
these years he's been away?

1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:30.900
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?

1:18:31.070 --> 1:18:33.970
Dickon was a knight before
your brother hacked off his spurs...

1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:35.510
...over some little mischance.

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:39.550
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king
who'd restore him to rank.

1:18:42.050 --> 1:18:45.850
- You don't love my brother, I hear.
- I have little reason to, Your Highness.

1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.820
- You know this tavern?
- Yes.

1:18:48.990 --> 1:18:53.980
- Lf Richard dies...
- Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.

1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:55.220
Am I not right?

1:18:55.400 --> 1:18:59.300
With the manor and estate
of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.

1:18:59.470 --> 1:19:02.300
- When shall I start?
- Immediately. How many men will you need?

1:19:02.470 --> 1:19:05.370
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.

1:19:05.540 --> 1:19:07.340
The sooner you're crowned king...

1:19:07.510 --> 1:19:11.710
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.

1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:14.870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:19.220
Return to your abbey and make
preparations to proclaim me king...

1:19:19.390 --> 1:19:22.250
...here in Nottingham,
the day after tomorrow.

1:19:34.570 --> 1:19:36.590
Do you suppose she heard?

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.800
I don't know.

1:19:47.650 --> 1:19:51.610
And now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.

1:19:51.790 --> 1:19:53.880
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.

1:20:19.710 --> 1:20:22.150
My lady's hearing
is a little defective tonight.

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:26.080
When you knock at a lady's door
as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.

1:20:26.250 --> 1:20:27.620
You seem upset.

1:20:27.790 --> 1:20:29.810
Upset? Why should I be?

1:20:30.590 --> 1:20:34.790
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:37.960
- Let's be frank with one another.
- I don't see the need.

1:20:38.130 --> 1:20:42.000
You're charming, Lady Marian, but not
exactly clever. You couldn't have failed...

1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:44.970
...to overhear what Prince John
and I were talking about.

1:20:45.140 --> 1:20:47.730
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.

1:20:47.910 --> 1:20:52.780
And your first thought, as Richard's
loyal ward, was to warn him.

1:20:52.950 --> 1:20:56.250
- Am I not right?
- Why, how could I warn Richard?

1:20:56.420 --> 1:20:58.820
How did Locksley and his men
arrange his escape...

1:20:58.990 --> 1:21:01.580
...from hanging after the archery match?

1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:04.660
Someone here in the castle
must have got word to him.

1:21:04.830 --> 1:21:06.290
That's ridiculous!

1:21:06.460 --> 1:21:09.120
When Richard's in danger,
what more natural...

1:21:09.300 --> 1:21:12.700
...than that you should try
to warn him through Locksley?

1:21:12.870 --> 1:21:15.630
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?

1:21:16.070 --> 1:21:19.010
- Don't you?
- No!

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:26.450
If that's true,
perhaps you'd explain before Prince John...

1:21:26.610 --> 1:21:29.280
...and the Court of Execution
the meaning of this.

1:21:30.650 --> 1:21:32.640
Guard!

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:40.130
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.

1:22:10.690 --> 1:22:13.680
Not only has she consorted with
this Saxon rebel...

1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:18.230
...found guilty of outlawry, theft,
murder, abduction and high treason...

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:22.270
...but she has betrayed
her own Norman people.

1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:25.570
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:31.110
Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame
that I'm a Norman...

1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:34.770
...after seeing the things my fellow
countrymen have done to England.

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:39.050
At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was
a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...

1:22:39.250 --> 1:22:42.090
...that the horrors you inflicted
on the Saxons weren't just.

1:22:42.260 --> 1:22:46.090
I know now why you tried so hard
to kill this outlaw whom you despised.

1:22:46.260 --> 1:22:49.250
It's because he was the one man
in England who protected the helpless...

1:22:49.430 --> 1:22:51.490
...against beasts
who were drunk on human blood!

1:22:51.670 --> 1:22:54.760
And now you intend
to murder your own brother!

1:22:55.070 --> 1:22:57.130
You'll be sorry you interfered.

1:22:57.310 --> 1:23:00.470
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.

1:23:01.610 --> 1:23:06.910
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that
is exactly what is going to happen to you.

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.880
You wouldn't dare.

1:23:11.050 --> 1:23:14.820
I'm the royal ward of King Richard
and no one but the king himself...

1:23:14.990 --> 1:23:17.420
...has the right to condemn me to death.

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:20.380
You are quite right, my dear.

1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:25.020
And it shall be a king who will order
your execution for high treason...

1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:28.400
...exactly 48 hours from now.

1:23:29.170 --> 1:23:30.730
Take her away.

1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:37.970
- Have you got it all in your stupid head now?
- Of course I have.

1:23:38.150 --> 1:23:41.240
Well, give Robin the whole message
exactly like I told it to you.

1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:44.480
Bess, where was Dickon
supposed to find King Richard?

1:23:44.650 --> 1:23:46.050
Oh, never mind him!

1:23:46.220 --> 1:23:48.880
What do I care about
your kings and thrones and such?

1:23:49.060 --> 1:23:51.750
Robin has gotta do something
to save my baby!

1:23:51.930 --> 1:23:55.190
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.850
- Where's Dickon heading for?
- Kent Road Tavern.

1:23:58.030 --> 1:24:02.130
Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles
and cut him off through Low Wood.

1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.200
Come on, lass,
give us a kiss and wish me luck.

1:24:07.210 --> 1:24:10.270
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.

1:24:10.450 --> 1:24:13.540
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.840
Of course I will.

1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.730
Greetings, sir abbot!

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:51.200
- You've traveled far this morning?
- Too far to be patient with delay now.

1:25:51.380 --> 1:25:55.340
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse
that wearies you. Now, I can remedy that.

1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:59.750
If it weighs more than a just amount
I'll share it with those who have less. Come.

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:02.820
You think I hand my purse
to every rough lout who asks for it?

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:12.030
You see, sir abbot?

1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:15.170
We're poor outlaws,
with nothing to eat but the king's deer...

1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:19.270
...while you have property,
rents, and silver. So your purse!

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:22.540
I've traveled far on the king's business
and the silver I have left...

1:26:22.710 --> 1:26:24.080
...equals no more than 60 marks.

1:26:24.250 --> 1:26:27.510
What?
Are you friendly to our good King Richard?

1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:29.950
I love no man better.

1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:31.980
By that speech you save half your money.

1:26:32.150 --> 1:26:34.620
Give me 30 marks for the poor
and the rest you may keep.

1:26:34.790 --> 1:26:35.850
Then I can go free?

1:26:36.030 --> 1:26:41.050
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?

1:26:41.230 --> 1:26:43.100
- Gladly.
- Then come.

1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:54.600
- Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
- I'm called Robin Hood.

1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:56.370
It seems I've heard of you.

1:26:56.550 --> 1:26:59.810
- Nothing good, I hope.
- Oh, now I remember!

1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.820
How does your loyalty
to Richard set on a killer of knights...

1:27:02.990 --> 1:27:05.220
...a poacher of the king's deer
and an outlaw?

1:27:05.390 --> 1:27:08.650
Those I kill died from misusing
the trust that Richard left them.

1:27:08.820 --> 1:27:11.380
And the worst rogue of these
is the king's own brother.

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:14.190
- Oh, then you blame Prince John.
- No, I blame Richard.

1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:18.560
His task was defending his people instead
of deserting them to fight in foreign lands.

1:27:18.730 --> 1:27:20.730
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?

1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.570
I'll condemn anything that leaves the task
of holding England to outlaws like me.

1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:37.780
Much!

1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:46.490
- Much, what's happened to you?
- Take me to Robin, quick!

1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:11.550
- Much, what's happened?
- King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!

1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:12.880
What?

1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:16.790
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern
last night to kill the king.

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:20.220
- Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...
- No need, master, no need.

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.260
I headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.

1:28:24.970 --> 1:28:28.800
- But the king? Where is he?
- I don't know, master.

1:28:29.470 --> 1:28:32.030
Men, Richard must be found.

1:28:32.210 --> 1:28:33.830
He must be brought here for safety.

1:28:34.010 --> 1:28:36.170
Little John, take a party
and scour the country.

1:28:36.350 --> 1:28:39.910
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.

1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:42.880
Don't rest, day or night,
until he's found. Understand?

1:28:43.050 --> 1:28:46.080
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.

1:28:46.260 --> 1:28:49.990
- He's in good hands. The best in England.
- What do you mean? Where is he?

1:28:50.830 --> 1:28:52.450
Here!

1:28:59.330 --> 1:29:01.170
Sire.

1:29:13.450 --> 1:29:16.250
All these have remained loyal.

1:29:16.420 --> 1:29:18.650
Rise, Sir Robin.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:21.150
Rise, men of Sherwood.

1:29:22.090 --> 1:29:24.750
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...

1:29:24.930 --> 1:29:27.020
...to proclaim him king
in Nottingham tomorrow.

1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:29.690
- How'd you learn this?
- Lady Marian. She overheard.

1:29:29.870 --> 1:29:31.590
They've taken her for treason.

1:29:31.770 --> 1:29:34.430
She's been condemned
to the block for warning us.

1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:36.540
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.

1:29:36.710 --> 1:29:40.300
You underestimate him. If we're to save
her and your throne, we've got to act now!

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:41.910
By attacking Nottingham castle?

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:45.270
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.

1:29:45.450 --> 1:29:48.810
If the Bishop of the Black Canons
is performing the ceremony tomorrow...

1:29:48.980 --> 1:29:53.080
...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight
and persuade him to suggest a way.

1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:17.580
Brace up. Smile!

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:21.580
Wider!

1:30:21.820 --> 1:30:24.810
Still sure it wasn't you
who warned my brother I was in England?

1:30:24.990 --> 1:30:26.610
Why, sire, believe me, l...

1:30:26.790 --> 1:30:29.420
Your Grace, smile!

1:30:30.190 --> 1:30:32.490
You'll sweat the lard
off that fat carcass of yours...

1:30:32.660 --> 1:30:34.650
...before this day's over, my pudgy friend.

1:30:34.830 --> 1:30:38.700
And I hope some Norman sword
whittles you down to size!

1:30:50.750 --> 1:30:52.650
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.

1:30:52.810 --> 1:30:56.610
Sanctify this thy servant,
our royal Prince John.

1:30:56.790 --> 1:31:02.190
Enrich his noble heart and bestow
upon him all princely virtues.

1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.090
Amen.

1:31:04.260 --> 1:31:05.920
No news of Richard.

1:31:06.090 --> 1:31:07.860
No. None, Your Highness.

1:31:08.030 --> 1:31:09.500
Then Dickon must have...

1:31:09.670 --> 1:31:12.160
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.

1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:16.390
Of course. Of course.

1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:23.410
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.

1:33:41.050 --> 1:33:42.980
Remember.

1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:52.060
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...

1:33:52.230 --> 1:33:55.630
...claim to be crowned this day,
sovereign of the realm...

1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:59.730
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher,
to receive the blessing of the church?

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:03.630
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.

1:34:03.810 --> 1:34:06.770
Is it of your own free will
that you thus depose your brother...

1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.670
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?

1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:10.870
Richard no longer exists!

1:34:11.050 --> 1:34:13.950
From this moment forward,
I, John, am king of England!

1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:17.140
Aren't you a little premature, brother?

1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:19.790
Richard! The Lion-Heart!

1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:22.050
He's lying! He's an imposter!

1:34:22.290 --> 1:34:24.620
- The king lives!
- Men of Sherwood!

1:34:26.390 --> 1:34:27.380
Robin Hood!

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:30.090
It's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!

1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:00.180
- Did I upset your plans?
- You've come to Nottingham once too often!

1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:02.850
When this is over, there'll be
no need for me to come again.

1:36:14.300 --> 1:36:16.290
Your sword, Gisbourne.

1:36:35.290 --> 1:36:37.890
- Know any prayers, my friend?
- I'll say one for you!

1:38:25.630 --> 1:38:27.100
Save yourself, Robin!

1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:37.140
The door, quick!
Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!

1:39:14.750 --> 1:39:17.550
But, Richard, Richard! I thought...

1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:20.190
- You thought I was murdered!
- Oh, no, no.

1:39:20.890 --> 1:39:25.050
I didn't mean to...
After all, Richard, I am your brother.

1:39:25.230 --> 1:39:27.560
Yes, sire, he is your brother.

1:39:27.730 --> 1:39:29.030
Yes, my brother.

1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:32.660
I could forgive you if your treachery
were against me and not my subjects.

1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.430
I banish you and your followers from England
for the remainder of my lifetime.

1:39:36.610 --> 1:39:39.070
Take them away.
See that they leave England.

1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:42.840
I further banish from my realm
all injustices and oppressions...

1:39:43.010 --> 1:39:46.000
...which have burdened my people.
And I pray that under my rule...

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:49.550
...Normans and Saxons alike
will share the rights of Englishmen.

1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:52.380
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

1:39:53.220 --> 1:39:55.520
What about you, Robin?

1:39:59.730 --> 1:40:02.250
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.

1:40:02.430 --> 1:40:04.520
Is there nothing the king
can grant the outlaw...

1:40:04.700 --> 1:40:06.460
...who showed him
his duty to his country?

1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:09.570
Yes, Your Majesty,
a pardon for the men of Sherwood.

1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:11.760
Granted with all my heart.

1:40:11.940 --> 1:40:14.500
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

1:40:15.210 --> 1:40:18.110
But is there nothing for yourself?

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:21.980
There's but one thing else, sire.

1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:25.120
And do you too wish...?

1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:28.380
More than anything in the world, sire.

1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.660
Kneel, Robin Hood.

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:37.600
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...

1:40:37.900 --> 1:40:40.770
...and lord of all the lands and manors
appertaining thereto.

1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:43.500
My first command to you, my lord earl...

1:40:43.670 --> 1:40:47.010
...is to take in marriage
the hand of the Lady Marian.

1:40:47.180 --> 1:40:51.810
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Robin Hood!

1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:53.710
Long live Lady Marian!

1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:56.110
And what say you to that,
