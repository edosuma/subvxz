Hey, look,
the late shift's leaving.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.332
I don't like
those guys.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.167
Yeah, they think they're better
than us just because

00:35.169 --> 00:37.136
their performance reviews
reflect that fact.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.705
Oh, no. I left a
candy bar in my desk.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.407
That's funny,
'cause I found

00:41.409 --> 00:45.077
this candy bar
in my desk.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.480
Time to punch in.

00:58.359 --> 01:01.260
Sir, the shifts are
fighting like Iran and Iraq.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.263
Who?
Persia and Mesopotamia.

01:04.265 --> 01:04.630
Hush!

01:04.632 --> 01:06.565
Sign your full legal name
here,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.567

shall be fully executed.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.606
Schicklgruber... Burns.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.175
Sir, is that your will?

01:16.177 --> 01:19.311
It is. I know it's hard
to see a young buck like me

01:19.313 --> 01:22.314
and think of a day
when I'm no longer in the pink.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.782
(sneezes)

01:23.784 --> 01:25.717
We just need one more
set of initials here.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.587
Quickly, now. We're almost
through the half hour per day

01:28.589 --> 01:30.155
where you're
mentally competent.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.291
And... (clock chimes)
...demented.

Your tortoise?!
Yes.

02:20.841 --> 02:21.907
It always saddens me

02:21.909 --> 02:25.310
that you and Sheldon
have never gotten along.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.282
Sir, how could you leave me
out of your will?

02:30.284 --> 02:31.884
I'm your right-hand man,
your guy Friday!

02:31.886 --> 02:34.853
Smithers, you are the
campiest of my aides du camp,

02:34.855 --> 02:37.489
but I'm afraid my true
admiration is reserved

02:37.491 --> 02:38.891
for the self-made man.

02:38.893 --> 02:43.228
No Steve Woz-ni-ak thee.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.164
So... you don't respect me?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.398
No, not until you earn it.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.736
Until then, I will never
see you as my equal.

Smithers... wait!

02:55.242 --> 02:55.941
Yes, sir?

02:55.943 --> 02:56.842
In case you
didn't hear me,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.944
I said I will never
see you as my equal.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.080
I heard you
very clearly, sir.
Excellent.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.585

03:06.887 --> 03:10.489
Hmm. Here's a place
I can feel wanted.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.325
You, with the
six-pack-- you're in.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.760
You, with the
Ben Affleck chin

03:14.762 --> 03:16.295
and the Matt Damon
everything else.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.863
Guess what?
You're in!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.665
In, in, in.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.667
Uh, in your dreams.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.635
Oh, come on.
I've had a rough day.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.737
With the buzz cut
and the bow tie?

03:25.739 --> 03:26.572
This is a nightclub,

03:26.574 --> 03:28.941
not a John F. Kennedy
cabinet meeting.

(laughter)

03:33.747 --> 03:35.247
(sighs)

03:35.249 --> 03:37.649
Can I have a
Scotch and water?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.586
My Scotch is
a Scotch and water.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.657
Business is slow, huh?

03:45.659 --> 03:49.494
Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised
you're not across the street,

03:49.496 --> 03:51.430
where they drink for fun,
instead of here,

03:51.432 --> 03:54.499
where, uh,
horrible addiction compels you.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.601
They won't let me in.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.236
No one wants an
executive assistant

03:57.238 --> 03:58.770
who only works out
six hours a day.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.839
If only this town

Listen, what if I
helped you turn this bar

04:17.024 --> 04:20.025
into a hangout
for guys like me?

04:20.027 --> 04:20.425
Uh-huh.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.361
Just so it's clear
what I'm proposing,

04:22.363 --> 04:23.862
the men I'm talking
about are...

04:23.864 --> 04:26.431
(whispering):
...men... dinner parties.

Whoa-ho-ho,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:28.369 --> 04:29.334
Uh, no offense, uh,

04:29.336 --> 04:30.836
but, uh,
I just ain't comfortable

04:30.838 --> 04:33.071
hanging around all night
with, uh, you know,

04:33.073 --> 04:35.574
whatchamacallit,
uh, swish kabobs.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.310
Mm, yeah, right.
That's too bad.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.044
Could have been fun.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.612
Could have made
a little money.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.313
Yeah, you know,
thank you,

04:41.315 --> 04:44.583
but, uh, I'm very happy with
my clientele as they are.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.586
Hey, Moe,
two more for me and my buddy.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.188
That was my grandmother's
wedding urinal!

04:50.190 --> 04:50.822
All right, that's it.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.524
We are changing
this place up.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.462
<i>Look at them renovations!</i>

04:57.464 --> 04:58.897
<i>And... finished!</i>

04:58.899 --> 05:02.034
After this,
ain't no turning back.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.437
(grunting)

05:06.006 --> 05:08.907
B-E! Four points.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.009
I challenge!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.078
Sorry, hobbits.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.748
It's back to the
shire for you. Slam!

05:17.718 --> 05:18.684
Oh, gentlemen,

05:18.686 --> 05:22.321
there is no need
to head home so soon.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.388
Hmm...

05:23.390 --> 05:24.523
Ew! Isn't that the place

05:24.525 --> 05:26.825
where all those rats
committed suicide?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.461
(chuckling):
Oh, it's totally different now.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.931
And it welcomes men
with a few extra pounds

05:32.933 --> 05:34.866
or a little less hair.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.968
Ooh!
Mmm.
What a great idea!

05:36.970 --> 05:40.372
What about
super-hairy
Wonder Woman?

05:40.374 --> 05:41.440
No problem.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.776
Thank you
for humoring me.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.519
So, uh, what would
you gentlemen like?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.722
(laughing):
I mean, I know
what you'd like,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.023
and, hey,
why wouldn't
you like it?

05:58.025 --> 06:01.026
Oh, ain't being comfortable
with something weird the best?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.495
I'm gonna pour some beers now.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.764
(laughter
and lively party chatter)

06:07.534 --> 06:08.100
Huh?

06:08.102 --> 06:10.402
Hey, something's
different about Moe's.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.903
There's no
chicks here.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.138
There's never
any chicks here.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.142
Somehow, there's more no
chicks here than usual.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.410
Something's
changed.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.078
There's a sense of
acceptance in the air.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.081
Hey, what's that guy doing
in the men's room?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.049
(gasps)

06:24.051 --> 06:25.851
He's washing his hands.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.853
I'm never gonna get that image
out of my head.

06:27.855 --> 06:31.857
Look, I have turned this bar
into every other kind of bar,

06:31.859 --> 06:32.858
and it never worked.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.626
MOE:
Total disaster.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.395
A complete bomb.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.829
Utter failure.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.664
Uh, dream I painted.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.732
And in this economy,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.501
a man needs
to find new customers

06:42.503 --> 06:44.636
while keeping
his old best friends.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.137
So, what do you say?

06:45.139 --> 06:47.639
Hey, there's nothing
against it in the bible.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.808
HOMER:
Hmm...

06:49.810 --> 06:51.743
(muttering agreement)
Uh-huh.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.878
Wait a minute!

06:52.880 --> 06:56.181
Your standard
markup is 400%?

06:56.183 --> 06:56.715
Now give me that!

06:56.717 --> 06:58.683
Don't you dare question
the gospel

06:58.685 --> 07:00.752
according to Dr. Swig McJigger.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.455
He's drinking
his own brains.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.861
(playing symphony)

07:09.863 --> 07:13.064
Children,
I have an announcement.

07:13.066 --> 07:17.569
Today is my last day
as your music teacher.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.373
(sotto voce): Come on, pretend
he meant something to you.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.042
Stay! Stay,
please!
Don't go!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.777
Oh, bless your little hearts.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.912
This is a happy thing.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.748
I met my soul mate
at a local tavern.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.817
There he is!

07:31.819 --> 07:33.151
ALL:
Aw.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.553
I'm not the soul mate!

07:34.555 --> 07:36.054
I'm dating one
of your mothers.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.522
I-I forget whose.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.223
Anyway, I-I'm here

07:38.225 --> 07:42.494
to introduce your new
music teacher, Ms. Juniper.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.262
Honey, just teach the one

07:44.264 --> 07:46.665
with the starfish head,
and you'll be okay.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.966
Teach? (laughs)

07:47.968 --> 07:49.868
You can't teach music.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.703
You embrace music.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.138
Oh, you inhale music.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.807
You roll around
in a pile of music until...

07:55.809 --> 07:56.675
(sniffs deeply)

07:56.677 --> 07:59.778
...the scent of music
is on you forever!

07:59.780 --> 08:02.247
Mm, good luck with that.
(car horn honking)

08:02.249 --> 08:03.782
Tick-tock, Dewey!

08:03.784 --> 08:05.784
Tanglewood beckons!

08:05.786 --> 08:06.785
Coming, Dewey!

08:06.787 --> 08:08.587
We're both named Dewey.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.722
Drumroll, please!

08:12.125 --> 08:13.191
(sighs)

08:13.760 --> 08:15.894
You know, this is
the first time

08:15.896 --> 08:16.895
I've ever been at Moe's

08:16.897 --> 08:19.998
without that little voice
in the back of my head saying,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.868
"This is not a safe place
to drink."

08:22.870 --> 08:25.270
Check out my
tolerance, Marge.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.873
I'm going to use
the men's room.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.008
Hey, I didn't know
you were,

08:30.010 --> 08:32.344
uh, you know,
one of those...

08:32.346 --> 08:33.278
I am not Comic Book Guy.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.847
I am his cousin, Comic Book Gay.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.883
But you do like comic books.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.084
Certain kinds.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.721
Oh, honey, no
one's gonna believe
that wig is real.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.989
What do you mean, wig?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.156
And about that voice.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.325
Hmm. What's wrong
with her voice?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.126
Steve, is that you?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.262
I'm gonna knock
you inside out.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.464
Doctor already did.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.866
Hey, Moe!
Looking good.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.233
Mm-hmm.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.736
He is cute with a
capital scrumptious.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.137
Uh, Moe,

08:59.139 --> 09:01.406
tomorrow's Gay Day
at Krustyland.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.040
Want to come?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.308
Oh. Oh, Grizzly Shawn,

09:03.310 --> 09:06.545
that-that's so nice of you
to think of me, but, uh,

09:06.547 --> 09:07.879
the Tony Awards are that night,

09:07.881 --> 09:10.315
and I'll be too keyed up
to have fun.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.583
Maybe some other time.

09:11.585 --> 09:15.820
Moe, do these guys think
you're one of them?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.222
Why would they think that?

09:17.224 --> 09:22.193
Oh, I love you,
Neil Patrick Hairless.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.899
(music playing)

09:30.904 --> 09:33.204
Huh. Yeah, maybe I
should clear the air.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.039
(music stops)

09:34.041 --> 09:35.173
(music stops playing on stereo)

09:35.175 --> 09:37.809
Uh, excuse me, fellas.
Excuse me!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.444
First of all, thank you.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.146
This bar was on its last legs.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.248
I was gonna have
to move in with Ma,

09:43.250 --> 09:45.083
who's dead
and doesn't have a house.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.451
So, would not have been good.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.053
Oh, yeah,
that's true.
No, no, no.

09:48.055 --> 09:51.957
But now there's, uh... There's
something I got to tell youse.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.858
Um...

09:56.730 --> 09:58.163
If you tell them
you're straight,

09:58.165 --> 09:59.798
they just might go
somewhere else.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.199
All right, all right,
good point,

10:01.201 --> 10:03.401
but, uh, let's hear
from Angel Moe.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.370
I am Angel Moe.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.105
(grunting)

10:07.107 --> 10:10.442
(demonic laugh)

10:10.844 --> 10:14.813
So, anyway, uh,
what I wanted to say was, uh...

10:14.815 --> 10:16.214
everybody vogue!

10:16.216 --> 10:18.783
(music plays)

10:28.862 --> 10:29.661
(strumming guitar)

10:29.663 --> 10:31.796
Children, if I learned anything

10:31.798 --> 10:32.964
from my years as a groupie

10:32.966 --> 10:36.835
for the Dave Matthews Band,
it was to listen.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.702
So now you listen...

10:37.704 --> 10:42.707
to the string quartet of birds,
river and wind and...

10:42.709 --> 10:43.208
(panting)

10:43.210 --> 10:44.909
We haven't met...
(coughs)

10:44.911 --> 10:47.345
...but something terrible
has happened.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.348
You misfiled the...
permission slips.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.818
You keep the green.
I need the white.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.757
Hey, come back to Earth,
Mr. Permission Man.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.724

gentlemen's club.

11:46.573 --> 11:50.041

you were a geezer-pleaser.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.017
Having a "lemon party"?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.320
Ooh, a good old-fashioned

I'm so sorry, uh,

12:16.236 --> 12:19.471

the men here
that you're...

12:32.986 --> 12:33.518
"one of them"?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.387
Hey, it's the bartender's job
to agree with the customer.

12:36.389 --> 12:40.225
Now, enough chitchat, I gotta
put up this new painting.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.526
Mm-hmm.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.362
A Tom of Shelbyville?
(groans)

12:44.364 --> 12:45.897
Just relax there, Waylon.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.232
We got a great
thing goin' on.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.434
Now we can afford
real bowls of pretzels

12:49.436 --> 12:52.904
instead of
trompe l'oeiling
them on the bar.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.339
(humming tune)

12:54.341 --> 12:55.240

12:55.242 --> 12:56.908

13:11.725 --> 13:12.924
What am I doing
here, Seymour?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.026
The thing I'm planning
hasn't even gone off yet.

13:15.028 --> 13:18.496
(screaming)
That wasn't me and
you're my alibi.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.998
Yes, well... (clears throat)

13:20.000 --> 13:24.569
I might have a crush
on the music sub, Ms. Juniper.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.371
Simpson, here's my plan.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.205
(groans)

13:27.207 --> 13:28.206
Ms. Juniper is divorced,

13:28.208 --> 13:31.743
and her daughter Melody
is in the third grade.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.478
Oh, yeah, her.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.879
Classic
space case.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.515
Well, if you took
"space case" on a date

13:37.517 --> 13:41.553
and brought me to chaperone
along with her mother...

13:41.555 --> 13:42.220
I see how it is.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.156
You get a booty call
and I get a cootie call.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.591
Well, it's gonna cost ya.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.560
How would you like two weeks
of spring break?

13:48.562 --> 13:51.362
Triple spring break plus
four weeks at Christmas.

13:51.364 --> 13:55.934
No, but... no, if,
if the state finds out,
they'll shut us down.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.969
Okay, have fun dying alone.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.170
Deal.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.875
I can't believe I'm playing
videogames with Bart Simpson.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.111
I've sketched you so many
times in my dream journal.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.580
(growls)

14:08.582 --> 14:09.447
Great, baby.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.949
Get me some more tokens.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.551
(beatboxing)

14:13.553 --> 14:17.689
Oh, Bart rides that board
with a passion

14:17.691 --> 14:19.224
of an Arapaho ghost dancer.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.460
You know, passion has always
been a passion of mine.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.630
(Bart growls annoyingly)

14:25.632 --> 14:27.398
Uh, something else about me

14:27.400 --> 14:30.301
is that I'm thinking of
becoming an excellent cook.

14:30.303 --> 14:34.505
♪ Would you love her?
Yes, I would, sir ♪

14:34.507 --> 14:35.473
Dance with me.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.977
What? Here? Right next
to the Nacho-Cano?

14:38.979 --> 14:40.345
I like you, Seymour.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.179
You do?

14:41.181 --> 14:42.313
(voice breaking):
But why?

14:42.315 --> 14:45.583
I mean,
(deep voice): but why?
Shh-shh-shh.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.552
Words are your enemy, my love.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.621
Melody is staying at
her father's tonight,

14:49.623 --> 14:52.657
and, well, I can't
dance by myself...

14:52.659 --> 14:54.325
although I do.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.227
(erupting)

14:56.229 --> 14:58.263
Can you believe it?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.231
Oh, this is an outrage.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.299
This morning
I was like...

15:01.301 --> 15:02.901
(upbeat):
♪ Ding-a-ling-a-ling. ♪

15:02.903 --> 15:03.501
and now I'm like...

15:03.503 --> 15:06.504
(downbeat):
♪ Dong-dong-dong. ♪

15:06.506 --> 15:07.405
Boys, relax,

15:07.407 --> 15:10.675
have a drink
and tell Mama Moe all about it.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.477
The city won't
let us march

15:12.479 --> 15:15.146
in the Springfield
Founder's Parade.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.147
Well, who needs them?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.448
We can have our own parade.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.051
We do. We have,
like, 20 of them.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.087
But we're sick of being
second-class citizens.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.155
Things will never change

15:24.157 --> 15:26.991
until one of us
is on the town council.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.026
Moe should run.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.996
He's the heart of this
town's gay community.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.097
(scowling)

15:33.099 --> 15:34.032
Will you do it, Moe?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.133
Will you become
Springfield's

15:35.135 --> 15:37.035
first openly gay
city councilman?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.871
Heh. Well, I think
if you guys can manage

15:39.873 --> 15:41.973
to go into the voting booth
one at a time,

15:41.975 --> 15:43.641
then I can manage to win.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.043
(cheering)
Hooray for Moe!

15:45.045 --> 15:51.049
Moe, can I discuss an inventory
issue with you in the back room?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.550
(nervous chuckle)

15:52.552 --> 15:54.619
You can't be these
people's leader

15:54.621 --> 15:57.388
if you're lying to them
about who you are.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.489
You're not gay.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.592
Whew. I thought
it was an inventory issue.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.260
That's a big relief.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.663
Now don't worry, I'll
let them down easy.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.265
In four years!

16:07.267 --> 16:08.566
(bar patrons cheering)

16:08.568 --> 16:11.102
Yes! Your queen is back!

16:11.104 --> 16:12.670
(fuming)

16:15.208 --> 16:17.308
♪ I'm walking on sunshine ♪

16:17.310 --> 16:18.443
♪ Not literally ♪

16:18.445 --> 16:21.312
♪ It means that
I'm happy post-coitally ♪

16:21.314 --> 16:24.115
♪ It was on a school night... ♪

16:24.117 --> 16:24.816
Skinner!

16:24.818 --> 16:28.052
That song needed
no lyrical improvement.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.287
Gary...

16:29.289 --> 16:31.723
Gary, you know
what you need?

16:31.725 --> 16:34.225
A little...
honey in your yogurt.

16:34.227 --> 16:34.993
Skinner!

16:34.995 --> 16:37.061
You're a regular Casanova.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.497
Or in English,
"new house."

16:40.200 --> 16:42.467
Come on, come to life!

16:42.469 --> 16:44.235
I swear I'll be nice to you.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.404
Can I do a handstand
against you?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.773
(grudgingly):
Sure.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.640
(sighs)

16:49.642 --> 16:52.176
Melody, you're
a great girl,

16:52.178 --> 16:55.380
but I see you as
more of a sister,

16:55.382 --> 16:57.048
and I don't like my sister.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.418
You're breaking up with me...
upside down?

17:00.420 --> 17:05.289
(sobbing):
Raggedy Ann was
so right about you.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.092
Thanks to you, Melody's
mother is so upset,

17:08.094 --> 17:10.128
she's moving them out of town.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.095
Good-bye, Seymour.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.465
Think of me whenever you see
a tattoo you don't understand.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.169
Calliope, is there anything
I can say to make you stay?

17:18.171 --> 17:21.105
No. But you can say
you'll come with us.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.206
Leave with you?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.541
I'll have to check with Mother.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.643
MRS. SKINNER:
Seymour, I found a ticket stub

17:25.645 --> 17:28.379
for a James Bond movie
in your pants.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.047
Explain yourself!

17:29.049 --> 17:32.617
Well, it-it, uh... took place
in a country we teach about.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.186
Fibs break baby Jesus's ribs.

17:35.188 --> 17:35.820
(dial tone)

17:35.822 --> 17:38.689
Look, I don't know
how long this will last.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.657
It could be a day.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.225
It could be the rest
of our lives.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.729
But you'll never know
unless you take this chance.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.099
Give yourself permission.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.344
Willie, you're principal now.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.112
Really?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.480
Who's the new groundskeeper?

18:02.482 --> 18:05.116
Also you, and you
don't get more money.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.851
Ach.
Yes.

18:06.853 --> 18:10.121
(fanfare plays)

18:14.627 --> 18:15.593
(microphone feedback squeal)

18:15.595 --> 18:19.697
My name is Moe Szyslak,
and I'm here to elect me.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.299
(cheering)

18:21.301 --> 18:22.300
Hello, Moe.

18:22.302 --> 18:22.834
Uh, hey there.

18:22.836 --> 18:26.671
Well, it's my business
partner, Mr. Smithers.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.905
Nice of you to drop by

18:27.907 --> 18:30.875
and not say nothin' that
costs nobody no election.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.411
But Moe, how can
you be their leader

18:33.413 --> 18:35.746
when you're not
one of them?

18:35.748 --> 18:36.747
ALL:
Oh!

18:36.749 --> 18:37.748
I am one of them.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.217
I only read Hustler

18:39.219 --> 18:41.452
to see the pictures
of Larry Flynt.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.320
Sounds great.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.454
But first, answer me this:

18:43.456 --> 18:45.356
Do you find me attractive?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.657
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.560
Like all gays, I'm
attracted to all men.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.331
Most insidious stereotype ever.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.198
You're cute.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.566
You want to go out
later?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.535
Whoever said that, yes.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.471
All right, if you're
attracted to me,

19:00.473 --> 19:02.540
then kiss me, Moe.

19:03.276 --> 19:07.211
Okay, okay, uh,
prepare to be kissed.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.280
Ha, here we go.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.883
Giving in to my
natural urges.

19:11.885 --> 19:16.120
Okay, a few jumping
jacks just to warm up.

19:17.090 --> 19:21.225
Okay, here comes
the airplane.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.798
I'm sorry, everyone.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.634
Oh, this is the most
embarrassing thing

19:29.636 --> 19:31.569
I've ever had
to say, but...

19:31.571 --> 19:32.670
I ain't gay!

19:32.672 --> 19:33.838
(all gasping)

19:33.840 --> 19:35.206
Oh, Moe.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.508
How could you lie
about who you are

19:37.510 --> 19:39.977
when who we are
is all we are?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.245
I didn't mean to.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.381
At first, I was only gay
for your money.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.784
And, and I had real, deep
feelings for that money.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.920
But then I-I felt accepted
by you

19:48.922 --> 19:51.489
in a way
that I'd never been before.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.691
I just wish
you people could know

19:53.693 --> 19:55.993
what it's like
to want acceptance.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.495
Well, so who you
gonna vote for?

19:57.497 --> 20:01.332
Me, or a Republican
whose record is so anti-gay,

20:01.334 --> 20:04.702
he's clearly secretly super gay.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.138
Now we don't know
who to vote for,

20:07.140 --> 20:08.906
the liar or the denier.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.374
Once again the powers that be

20:10.376 --> 20:14.145
have spurned our request
for basic human equality.

20:14.147 --> 20:18.549
Must not the heavens
themselves cry with rage?

20:18.551 --> 20:21.652
(thunder crashing)

20:21.654 --> 20:22.787
How did you do that?

20:22.789 --> 20:25.489
Classical training.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.526
(crowd murmuring)

20:29.529 --> 20:30.461
I'm very sorry.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.496
I-I had to do what
I thought was right.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.933
Well, as long as I
got nothin' to lose.

20:38.137 --> 20:38.669
Not bad.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.807
Like Frisbee golf,
I'm glad I tried it once.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.646
What happened?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.248
Well, it could
have been a day,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.917
it could have been
the rest of my life.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.584
And?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.987
(sighs)
It was only a day.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.456
You've been gone
for three months.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.957
Groovy.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.765
MOE:
Puttin' everything back.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.767
<i>Undo. Undo. Undo.</i>

21:09.769 --> 21:13.804
<i>Sports page back</i>
<i>over the urinal, and done.</i>
