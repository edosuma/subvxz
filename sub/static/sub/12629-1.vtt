Katelin, voice over: Hi. My
name is Katelin Kingsford,

00:08.558 --> 00:10.642
but my friends call me...
Dork.

00:10.727 --> 00:13.746
Katelin: Well, they're not
exactly friends.

00:13.863 --> 00:14.903
They're the competition...

00:14.931 --> 00:17.866
Fall! Fall! Fall!

00:17.901 --> 00:19.968
Katelin:
And I'm the girl to beat.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.839
Show-off.

00:23.907 --> 00:26.992
Katelin: I was told that jealousy
is the highest form of flattery.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.911
Of course it hurts a little.

00:28.978 --> 00:30.378
But if they didn't hate me so much,

00:30.379 --> 00:32.214
then how would I know how good I was?

00:32.281 --> 00:34.650
These are 'rents, ed and Linda.

00:34.751 --> 00:36.518
They're loving, supportive...

00:36.586 --> 00:37.986
Whoo!

00:38.087 --> 00:39.488
Whoo!

00:39.556 --> 00:41.540
That's my girl!

00:41.624 --> 00:43.144
Katelin: And incredibly
embarrassing.

00:43.159 --> 00:45.577
The craniac next to them
is my brother Bradley.

00:45.662 --> 00:46.795
Sure he's a geek,

00:46.863 --> 00:49.198
but he also has the best
slap shot in the state.

00:49.265 --> 00:52.100
Bradley has no respect for us twirl girls.

00:52.202 --> 00:54.036
Still, my parents always make him come.

00:56.339 --> 00:59.241
My coaches Bob and ginger
have trained me forever.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.176
Ginger does my hair and makeup.

01:01.244 --> 01:03.045
She makes me sparkle.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.681
Bob, my choreographer, says
he has more moves in him

01:05.749 --> 01:07.349
than all the rockettes combined...

01:07.417 --> 01:08.350
Whoever they are.

01:08.451 --> 01:09.651
Pop and pop!

01:09.719 --> 01:10.999
Katelin:
I love Bob and ginger.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.121
They are spectacular human beings.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.723
But the truth is...

01:14.774 --> 01:16.358
They're never gonna get my picture

01:16.426 --> 01:18.093
on the cover of a cereal box.

01:18.127 --> 01:21.296
For that, you need a Russian.

01:21.364 --> 01:24.199
Natasha Goberman makes
figure skating champions

01:24.300 --> 01:26.585
as easily as I can fake a smile.

01:26.703 --> 01:28.754
It is my dream to one day
train with someone

01:28.822 --> 01:31.607
of her caliber and nationality.

01:31.674 --> 01:34.176
After all, I am the best.

01:35.612 --> 01:38.263
But I need a scrunchy.

01:38.297 --> 01:39.915
How about a barrette?

01:39.983 --> 01:42.951
Aah! Don't you know
anything about skating?

01:43.019 --> 01:45.154
I do.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.422
Here, take mine.

01:47.490 --> 01:48.490
Really?

01:48.558 --> 01:49.591
Yeah, sure.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.362
I'll just use my lucky rubber band instead.

01:51.363 --> 01:52.044
Thanks.

01:52.162 --> 01:54.263
No prob.
Now go get 'em.

01:54.330 --> 01:55.330
Katelin: Let's face it.

01:55.398 --> 01:56.958
The karmic brownie points I just earned

01:56.959 --> 01:59.167
would be invaluable in today's competition.

01:59.269 --> 02:00.736
Not that I need any help.

02:00.804 --> 02:03.021
I'm a lock to win.

02:05.975 --> 02:07.976
Katelin: Or so I thought.

02:08.044 --> 02:11.480
My lucky rubber band was kinda old.

02:11.548 --> 02:15.417
And who knew that rubber didn't retain
its integrity as long as a scrunchy?

02:15.485 --> 02:17.686
Oh, well.
The damage was done.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.903
[Applause]

02:43.680 --> 02:44.980
Push!

02:46.733 --> 02:47.883
Was it my Axel?

02:47.951 --> 02:49.718
And your lutzes and your spins.

02:49.786 --> 02:51.286
And that dress?
Come on.

02:51.354 --> 02:53.234
Katelin: While the criticism
wasn't very nice,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.489
it certainly wasn't unfounded.

02:54.557 --> 02:56.959
They say you're either
a Britney or a Christina.

02:57.026 --> 02:58.293
But here on the ice,

02:58.361 --> 03:00.596
you're either a Kristi
Yamaguchi or a Tonya Harding.

03:00.663 --> 03:01.747
Both have their merits,

03:01.864 --> 03:03.265
but only one has a gold medal.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.533
Girl: Have you
seen her legs?

03:04.534 --> 03:05.854
Second girl:
She's such a klutz.

03:05.855 --> 03:07.703
Did you see her fall?
It's a sad fact.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.671
Katelin:
They were all Tonyas.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.073
It was a tiny
over-rotation,

03:11.140 --> 03:13.008
not a bad perm on school picture day.

03:13.076 --> 03:14.116
Don't worry about a thing.

03:14.143 --> 03:15.727
I don't think anyone even noticed.

03:15.761 --> 03:17.713
And besides, the rest of
your routine was ice.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.932
The judges love you.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.151
Katelin: Liars.
All of them.

03:23.252 --> 03:24.386
But what can you do?

03:24.437 --> 03:27.723
We all need comforting at a time like this.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.724
I was terrible!

03:28.791 --> 03:31.360
I know, I know.
What was I thinking?

03:31.362 --> 03:32.594
Where's my scrunchy?

03:32.662 --> 03:33.862
Katelin...
honey...

03:33.930 --> 03:35.770
with your technical
score and choreography...

03:35.771 --> 03:38.233
they couldn't deduct a single point.

03:38.235 --> 03:41.036
[Applause]

03:44.340 --> 03:46.841
Katelin:
They deducted 5 points.

03:46.876 --> 03:49.378
So maybe I'm not the best
skater in the world yet.

03:49.445 --> 03:51.525
But with the right coaching
and the right scrunchy,

03:51.526 --> 03:52.581
one day, I'm going to be.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.083
Let's break training.
Who wants a

03:55.151 --> 03:56.985
frozen yogurt?!
Frozen yogurt?!

03:57.053 --> 03:59.054
[Russian accent] Excuse me, I'm...

03:59.122 --> 04:01.189
Natasha Goberman!
Natasha Goberman!

04:01.241 --> 04:04.192
Ah. You know my work.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.630
There isn't a skater or a coach
worth her salchow who doesn't.

04:08.698 --> 04:11.266
You flatter me.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.702
Do you mind if I have a word with the girl?

04:13.770 --> 04:15.954
No.
Go right ahead.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.505
You want to talk to me?

04:17.607 --> 04:18.957
No.

04:18.991 --> 04:21.476
I want to make you a star.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.345
Oh!

04:31.955 --> 04:33.789
Here you go.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.758
Sputnik, you were a firecracker on the ice.

04:36.826 --> 04:39.761
Your jumps were Miles
above any girl out there.

04:39.829 --> 04:41.663
Really? I'm that good?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.765
Oh, no. Your artistry
is twitchy.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.133
Your technique needs training,

04:45.201 --> 04:47.502
and a little less with the jazz hands.

04:47.570 --> 04:50.171
Oh.
But...

04:50.206 --> 04:51.657
You could be that good.

04:53.142 --> 04:56.445
Let me ask you question.
Why do you skate?

04:56.512 --> 04:58.680
Well, that's easy.
Because of the glitter.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.781
Oh.

04:59.783 --> 05:03.518
And because when my
blades touch that ice...

05:03.586 --> 05:05.354
Wow.

05:05.421 --> 05:07.923
[Sighs] Out there, I know
what I'm supposed to do

05:07.974 --> 05:09.791
and how I'm supposed to act,

05:09.859 --> 05:12.177
and no one can judge me.

05:12.261 --> 05:15.197
Well, except for the judges, of course.

05:15.331 --> 05:17.599
Sometimes I feel like if I
don't skate, I'll scream.

05:17.667 --> 05:22.371
And that, my little sputnik,
is why I'm here.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.973
It would be my honor to train you.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.542
Katelin:
Am I dreaming this?

05:27.610 --> 05:29.211
This is no dream.

05:29.213 --> 05:31.013
It's nightmare.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.816
But those who survive it
are among the best in the world.

05:34.818 --> 05:37.152
I wanna be the best in the world.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.205
Then you must train with me
at Buckston academy.

05:40.207 --> 05:43.408
I'm the head coach
of the figure skating club.

05:43.526 --> 05:47.062
And with the right coaching,
by yours truly,

05:47.130 --> 05:48.897
you could be champion.

05:51.034 --> 05:53.234
Katelin: Champion. Hmm.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.569
Boarding school?

05:54.637 --> 05:56.471
Yes, mom.
I have to go.

05:56.539 --> 05:57.399
No, you don't.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.440
There's nothing wrong with

05:58.441 --> 05:59.641
the high school you're at now.

05:59.656 --> 06:00.936
You're getting a fine education.

06:01.003 --> 06:02.403
Mom, this isn't about my education.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.244
It's about my future.

06:03.245 --> 06:04.346
It's too expensive.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.548
We could use my college money.

06:06.582 --> 06:07.883
Guess again, katelin.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.918
[Pouts] Daddy, help.

06:09.986 --> 06:11.987
We're tapped out, kid.
The well is dry.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.756
But I have to train
with her. She's Russian.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.692
Natasha Goberman is the
toughest coach on ice.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.161
You wouldn't last a day with her.

06:19.261 --> 06:20.175
Mother!

06:20.176 --> 06:21.496
Now the only thing you have to do

06:21.497 --> 06:23.577
is go upstairs and bring
me down your dirty whites.

06:23.612 --> 06:25.332
Could you hand me the remote before you go?

06:25.333 --> 06:29.087
Katelin: Uhh! Do you believe they
actually let these two reproduce?

06:31.107 --> 06:33.125
Hey, Brad. How goes?

06:33.192 --> 06:34.876
Do you ever knock?

06:34.944 --> 06:37.245
Geometry homework.
Yeech!

06:37.263 --> 06:40.615
Wrong again, Einstein.
They're hockey positions.

06:40.683 --> 06:44.619
See, hockey is just geometry on ice.

06:44.687 --> 06:46.588
Whatev! I have
a serious problem.

06:46.590 --> 06:48.373
[Sighs] What do you want now?

06:48.458 --> 06:51.326
Your rare hockey puck collection.

06:52.428 --> 06:53.295
Get out!

06:53.429 --> 06:55.080
Bradley, please?

06:55.164 --> 06:57.099
I need the money for tuition...

06:57.233 --> 06:59.901
And you'd be the very first
person I thanked on the podium.

06:59.969 --> 07:01.937
Hmm. No!

07:01.988 --> 07:04.539
[Pouts] I can't believe
how selfish you are.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.892
Me?!

07:06.976 --> 07:08.976
You want me to give you
my most prized possession

07:08.977 --> 07:10.912
just so you can
flunk out of boarding school?

07:10.980 --> 07:12.314
And win a gold medal.

07:12.316 --> 07:13.949
Katelin...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.151
You're the most spoiled,
self-absorbed,

07:16.219 --> 07:19.254
Prima Donna twirl girl I've ever met.

07:20.623 --> 07:22.124
I'm not self-absorbed.

07:22.126 --> 07:23.925
I did that walkathon.
Ha!

07:24.060 --> 07:26.128
You walked a half a block

07:26.162 --> 07:28.497
and only raised $3.00
for "models without mascara."

07:28.564 --> 07:31.340
Ok! Ok! So the walkathon
wasn't my finest hour,

07:31.341 --> 07:33.301
but you don't have to be
such a weenie about it.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.270
[Sighs] I have to get to hockey practice.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.339
Oh, big deal.
Hockey, hockey, hockey.

07:37.473 --> 07:38.840
Get out!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.842
[Pouts] Not until I get my gold medal.

07:40.910 --> 07:43.230
And there better not be one
puck missing when I get back,

07:43.231 --> 07:45.151
or there won't be
a safe place for you to hide.

07:46.315 --> 07:47.449
Uhh!

07:53.489 --> 07:55.557
Miss Goberman, my well is dry.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.865
Do you know what it's like
to be so close to your dream

07:57.866 --> 08:00.226
and then have it ripped out
from under you just like that?

08:00.227 --> 08:01.997
No...

08:02.064 --> 08:03.784
But I do know what it's like to be shut out

08:03.785 --> 08:06.868
of the first 2 world championships

08:06.936 --> 08:08.470
and see your future slipping away

08:08.521 --> 08:12.374
quicker than Pierogis at
Vladimir putin dinner party.

08:12.441 --> 08:13.808
Huh?

08:15.178 --> 08:17.028
Listen, sputnik,

08:17.180 --> 08:19.481
I need champion again.

08:19.532 --> 08:20.648
I need you.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.536
Mmm!

08:24.538 --> 08:26.054
I have idea.

08:26.122 --> 08:28.056
Wait here.
I be right back.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.697
Have you lost your mind?

08:35.765 --> 08:38.549
No... And I hate
second opinions.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.068
Look, I've got one scholarship
position to fill this year,

08:41.136 --> 08:42.703
and it ain't gonna be with her.

08:42.755 --> 08:43.855
She's spunky.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.590
She's too tiny to play hockey.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.242
Ah, but that's her advantage.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.244
She can get in and out of places

08:49.312 --> 08:51.379
your girls couldn't even dream of.

08:51.381 --> 08:52.781
But those legs!

08:52.783 --> 08:55.567
You are looking at the only
skater under 16 years of age

08:55.601 --> 08:58.720
who has ever done a triple
Axel in competition.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.772
Really?
Would I lie?

09:00.856 --> 09:02.157
To get what you want?

09:02.174 --> 09:05.327
Would I lie to you, morty?

09:05.394 --> 09:08.613
Natasha, my team is bad enough as it is.

09:08.731 --> 09:11.899
This recruitment's my one chance to
get some fresh blood in the lineup.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.535
I'd owe you.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.537
What you say?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.788
[Chuckles] Well...

09:16.905 --> 09:18.590
The way I see it, there are only 3 things

09:18.741 --> 09:21.543
that are gonna get your
figure skater on my hockey team.

09:21.611 --> 09:22.610
Yes?

09:22.645 --> 09:26.014
You, me, and a restaurant by the sea.

09:26.115 --> 09:29.217
Pick me up at 8:00.

09:29.352 --> 09:32.020
A scholarship?
Oh, I can't believe it.

09:32.022 --> 09:35.557
Welcome to Buckston academy.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.559
You start hockey training in a week.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.961
Hockey?!

09:40.029 --> 09:41.613
Don't you mean figure skating?

09:41.730 --> 09:43.064
No.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.767
This school doesn't offer
scholarship for figure skating.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.970
No high school or college
in the country does.

09:49.038 --> 09:51.640
How unfair is that, America?

09:51.642 --> 09:53.808
But I can't play hockey.

09:53.876 --> 09:55.810
I'm only getting
a c-minus in geometry.

09:55.878 --> 09:57.779
What does that have to do with hockey?

09:57.830 --> 10:00.548
You have to ask my brother,
although I don't recommend it.

10:00.616 --> 10:02.884
Plus, those uniforms are hideous.

10:02.935 --> 10:03.952
I can't do it.

10:03.954 --> 10:05.987
Katelin, listen to me.

10:06.055 --> 10:11.760
Everyone knows you cannot pull
fish out of pond without labor.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.895
Do you want to train with me?

10:13.996 --> 10:15.063
Yes.

10:15.164 --> 10:16.631
Do you want to be the best?

10:16.699 --> 10:17.665
Yes!

10:17.700 --> 10:19.668
Do you want you face on cereal box?

10:19.768 --> 10:21.269
More than anything!

10:21.337 --> 10:23.238
Then there is no alternative.

10:23.306 --> 10:24.673
You will play hockey.

10:24.740 --> 10:27.475
Here is your schedule.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.327
When will I find time to train?

10:29.412 --> 10:31.546
In the blocks I marked in red.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.251
Now... Go get your fish.

10:38.521 --> 10:40.188
[Dog barks]

10:40.256 --> 10:43.708
Wow.
Ha ha!

10:43.826 --> 10:44.993
What's going on?

10:45.061 --> 10:46.941
I though we couldn't play
hockey in the house?

10:46.942 --> 10:48.982
Didn't you hear? Katelin
got a hockey scholarship.

10:48.983 --> 10:49.964
What?!

10:50.032 --> 10:51.599
She doesn't even know how to play!

10:51.700 --> 10:53.220
Come on, Bradley.
How hard can it be?

10:53.224 --> 10:54.584
I just scored 3 points off of dad.

10:54.585 --> 10:56.338
You mean she...

10:56.405 --> 10:58.139
But I'm the one...

10:58.190 --> 10:59.274
Are you kidding me?!

10:59.342 --> 11:00.809
It's no joke.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.678
Oh, that's 4.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.197
See? Ha!

11:06.282 --> 11:08.383
Wow. This
is so easy.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.452
[Laughs]

11:10.519 --> 11:12.053
[Sighs]

11:12.121 --> 11:14.122
Oh, mom, you're not still sad, are you?

11:14.190 --> 11:16.524
I'm not sad.
I'm excited.

11:16.526 --> 11:20.195
I think this boarding school's
gonna be a great thing for you.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.729
My little girl's growing up.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.132
Yes, she is.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.900
Ok, kids.
In the trunk.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.736
What about leaving the plushies at home?

11:28.771 --> 11:31.573
Mom, I can't go to school
without my old friends.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.541
This is a chance for you
to meet new friends,

11:33.575 --> 11:34.909
real ones this time.

11:36.746 --> 11:39.431
Mom, I'm not going to Buckston
academy to make friends.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.149
I'm going there to skate.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.522
[Sighs]

11:42.523 --> 11:45.403
You're gonna learn that there's a lot
more to life than figure skating.

11:45.488 --> 11:47.756
Not for me.

11:47.823 --> 11:49.257
There could be.

11:49.325 --> 11:51.325
No.

11:56.599 --> 11:58.400
Katelin: I thought
balance was balance,

11:58.467 --> 12:01.269
but I can barely stand
on these hockey skates.

12:01.337 --> 12:03.421
Life is a game, eagles!

12:03.539 --> 12:05.240
Hockey is not.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.026
And when you stepped onto this ice today...

12:08.144 --> 12:10.078
Excuse me.
I'm totally lost.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.266
Could someone please tell me

12:11.267 --> 12:12.947
where the girls hockey team is practicing.

12:12.948 --> 12:14.883
We <i>are the girls hockey team.</i>

12:16.652 --> 12:18.887
Oh. Right on.

12:18.954 --> 12:21.439
Kingsford, you're late!

12:24.427 --> 12:26.060
Where was I?

12:26.128 --> 12:28.296
Life is a game, ladies.

12:28.364 --> 12:29.798
Hockey is not.

12:29.865 --> 12:31.199
Is he for real?

12:31.267 --> 12:32.834
Shh!

12:32.902 --> 12:35.837
...everything that you believe
to be truth is no longer true.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.105
I can do this.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.741
If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.

12:39.809 --> 12:41.810
They're just girls, just like me,

12:41.877 --> 12:43.778
except bigger and meaner

12:43.846 --> 12:46.481
with unconditioned hair.

12:46.549 --> 12:48.633
I can do this.
I can do this.

12:48.717 --> 12:50.084
We are a unit on this ice.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.619
We all operate together.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.721
And when you put those jerseys on,

12:53.789 --> 12:57.458
you made a commitment
to give your lives to me.

12:57.493 --> 12:58.593
Now...
coach.

12:58.661 --> 13:01.462
What? What? What, Spencer?
I'm on a roll here.

13:01.497 --> 13:02.730
What's up with number 36?

13:04.733 --> 13:05.650
What's going on?

13:05.734 --> 13:07.401
Oh. She's, um...

13:07.503 --> 13:11.105
She's our secret weapon.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.677
But she can barely keep her helmet up.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.359
It's all part of the strategy.

13:14.476 --> 13:16.945
All part of the strategy, Spencer.

13:17.012 --> 13:18.847
Now may I continue?

13:18.914 --> 13:20.365
Proceed.

13:20.482 --> 13:23.818
That commitment began the moment
you stepped on this ice today,

13:23.886 --> 13:28.022
and it won't stop until
you give me your last breath

13:28.090 --> 13:29.674
or a championship ring.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.528
Yeah. Well, why don't
we just make a promise

13:33.629 --> 13:35.747
to do out best out there,
all right, ladies?

13:35.865 --> 13:37.665
Didn't he say this last year?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.000
Sorry.

13:39.002 --> 13:41.202
These shoulder pads are
so not from our generation.

13:41.204 --> 13:42.187
Here, katelin.

13:42.271 --> 13:43.704
Why don't you try this on for size?

13:43.739 --> 13:46.541
Uhh! Ok.

13:49.011 --> 13:52.380
Oh, wow. I love the fit,
but do you have it in orange?

13:52.448 --> 13:53.848
Yeah, that's on the top of my list.

13:53.849 --> 13:55.550
All right, ladies.
Let's practice.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.085
[Blows whistle]

13:57.152 --> 13:59.187
Move, girls!
Move! Let's go!

13:59.255 --> 14:01.722
Let's go, 36!
Move! Move! Move!

14:01.757 --> 14:03.197
Coach: Come on, ladies!
Pick it up!

14:03.198 --> 14:07.328
Spencer: What are you doing?
Let's go! Hustle!

14:09.431 --> 14:12.333
[Pouts]

14:12.401 --> 14:14.435
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

14:15.738 --> 14:18.306
Uhh!

14:18.374 --> 14:19.741
Coach: Somebody
get her up.

14:19.808 --> 14:22.243
Note to self:
No toe pick.

14:22.311 --> 14:24.412
Must practice stopping on edges.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.720
[Blows whistle] Come on, girls!

14:25.764 --> 14:27.916
Move! Move! Move!
Let's go! Let's go!

14:27.983 --> 14:30.685
Come on! Dig, girls! Dig!

14:35.724 --> 14:38.159
Kid's got potential.

14:38.227 --> 14:39.661
She's bootsy.

14:39.728 --> 14:41.696
I know. She's great.

14:41.764 --> 14:44.082
Bootsy means terrible.

14:44.199 --> 14:46.935
I know that.

14:47.002 --> 14:48.882
Coach: Come on, girls!
Let's move it! Move it!

14:48.883 --> 14:50.271
Let's go!
Come on!

14:50.339 --> 14:52.941
36, you're a disaster out there!

14:53.008 --> 14:54.776
You're not supposed to hit the cones.

14:54.843 --> 14:59.581
You avoid the cones!

14:59.648 --> 15:01.849
Yeah. They're just
in their way.

15:01.917 --> 15:04.102
Ignore the cones.

15:04.253 --> 15:06.054
[Blows whistle] Up...

15:06.105 --> 15:08.189

15:15.097 --> 15:17.966
Come on, 36. Up... Down.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.701
Up. Down.

15:19.768 --> 15:21.669
Excuse me, but I am not a number.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.983
I have a name, and it's katelin.

15:23.105 --> 15:25.023
Oh, really? Well, I have
another one for you:

15:25.040 --> 15:26.273
Useless.

15:26.308 --> 15:30.411
Up. Down. Up. Down.

15:30.479 --> 15:33.081
Coach: Up... And down.

15:33.215 --> 15:34.649

The robo wars are coming.

15:39.121 --> 15:41.389
Yeah, I know.
Keep it down, will ya?

15:42.658 --> 15:43.825
I already entered.

15:43.892 --> 15:46.460
You did? But what about
hockey practice every day?

15:46.495 --> 15:47.845
How are you gonna do 'em both?

15:47.930 --> 15:49.297
I'm not playing anymore.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.665
But you love hockey.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.233
Yeah, I know, but...

15:52.301 --> 15:54.068
What's the point?

15:56.905 --> 15:58.873
Girl: Feels a little better.

15:58.974 --> 16:02.844
Second girl: You get
more rotation out of it?

16:26.502 --> 16:28.503
Oh, man.

16:31.106 --> 16:32.106
[Turns music off]

16:32.174 --> 16:33.307
Well, ladies...

16:33.375 --> 16:37.011
[Slams clipboard on ground]

16:37.046 --> 16:38.946
That could have gone better,

16:39.014 --> 16:41.749
but I'm sure that's no indication

16:41.817 --> 16:43.618
of how the season will turn out,

16:43.719 --> 16:46.154
right, eagles?

16:46.221 --> 16:47.205
Right, eagles?

16:47.289 --> 16:48.289
All: Right.

16:48.357 --> 16:49.891
Hollywood,

16:49.906 --> 16:52.026
I thought you told me you
were training this summer?

16:52.094 --> 16:55.213
Yeah, you'd never know by your skating.

16:55.297 --> 16:56.898
Mojo.

16:56.965 --> 17:00.218
The puck isn't going to
magically find your stick.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.437
Ha ha.
Not yet it isn't.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.839
Ronnie, don't even get me started.

17:05.907 --> 17:09.227
As captain, you gotta keep
these girls in line out there.

17:09.310 --> 17:10.578
They look to you as an example.

17:10.679 --> 17:12.930
Especially the freshmen.

17:13.015 --> 17:16.050
How you feeling, kid?
A little tired?

17:16.085 --> 17:18.086
If my legs could talk, they'd scream.

17:18.153 --> 17:20.655
You'll get better. You
just need a little rest.

17:20.723 --> 17:22.643
If she got any more rest,
she'd have bed sores.

17:22.644 --> 17:24.224
Hey, stow it!

17:24.292 --> 17:25.607
All right, ladies,

17:25.608 --> 17:27.528
pick up your practice
schedules on the way out,

17:27.596 --> 17:30.281
and I will see everybody
bright eyed and bushy-tailed

17:30.399 --> 17:32.233
tomorrow morning, 7 A.M.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.303
[Gasps] 7 A.M.!

17:35.370 --> 17:36.504
Coach!

17:36.572 --> 17:38.372
I don't know about that.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.809
If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.512
[Groans] Who am I kidding?

17:44.580 --> 17:45.713
That's right, I'm quitting.

17:45.781 --> 17:48.149
I don't think so, kid.

17:48.217 --> 17:50.585
You're on the team until I say you're not.

17:50.619 --> 17:52.887
You can't be serious.

17:53.021 --> 17:54.188
Oh, I am serious.

17:54.289 --> 17:56.369
I broke a lot of rules
to get you that scholarship,

17:56.370 --> 17:58.926
and if you quit now, people
will start asking questions.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.195
And if people ask questions,
people get answers.

18:01.296 --> 18:03.030
And if people get the right answers,

18:03.098 --> 18:05.900
I could be in a lot of trouble, you follow?

18:05.902 --> 18:08.603
You lost me at "oh,
I don't think so, kid."

18:08.605 --> 18:12.039
Ok, let me make this perfectly clear.

18:12.107 --> 18:14.475
You keep coming to practice,

18:14.543 --> 18:16.978
I keep my job.

18:17.045 --> 18:19.747
So I have no say in this matter at all?

18:19.815 --> 18:21.615
None.

18:21.650 --> 18:24.452
But you play your cards right,

18:24.503 --> 18:26.120
you won't have to play a single game.

18:26.155 --> 18:28.756
You'd really bench me?

18:28.807 --> 18:30.324
Oh, that's the nicest thing

18:30.459 --> 18:32.426
anyone's done for me
since I've gotten here.

18:32.494 --> 18:33.894
Yeah, yeah.
I'm an angel of mercy.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.663
Go change, will ya?
Oh, hey.

18:35.731 --> 18:36.931
And I would keep my mouth shut

18:36.933 --> 18:38.733
about the figure skating
club if I were you.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.134
Why?

18:40.169 --> 18:41.769
Because you don't wanna give these girls

18:41.770 --> 18:43.838
any other reason to skin you alive.

18:43.972 --> 18:46.574
I've always hated figure skaters.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.342
I've got no idea why.

18:48.410 --> 18:50.611
Maybe it's the leotards, I think,

18:50.679 --> 18:53.214
or the glitter.

18:53.282 --> 18:55.683
I love the glitter.
Ha ha!

18:57.686 --> 18:58.686
Yeah.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.154
Well, you just do what I say,

19:00.159 --> 19:01.639
and we'll both get through the season

19:01.756 --> 19:03.090
with our feathers intact.

19:03.158 --> 19:04.659
Feathers?

Oh, well. Some things
never change.

01:26:03.808 --> 01:26:05.526
Luckily, I did.

Katelin: And even if
Bradley says

01:26:27.932 --> 01:26:29.933
he only sacrificed his robot
to win the bet,

01:26:30.001 --> 01:26:31.535
I think differently.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:33.003
I've come to realize

01:26:33.071 --> 01:26:35.606
that no matter how embarrassing they are,

01:26:35.673 --> 01:26:37.608
I am part of something bigger

01:26:37.675 --> 01:26:39.543
than the figure skating community...

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:41.211
A family.
