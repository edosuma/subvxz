01:15.576 --> 01:17.844
‐ Yes!
‐ Whoo!

01:17.844 --> 01:21.415
A couple months ago,
I was just teaching a bunch
of little kids in Boston.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.850
Here I am now in the top 13.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.686
<i>I started out a little quiet,</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:28.755
<i>but I definitely feel</i>
<i>like today's gonna be</i>
<i>my day to shine.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:29.823
I want to show the judges
what I'm made of.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.925
Welcome back, everybody.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.027
Tonight, we have
an incredible chef

01:34.027 --> 01:36.430
joining us in
the MasterChef kitchen.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.632
A name I promise
you all know.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.767
Their palette is phenomenal.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.670
Their presentation skills
are out of this world.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.273
This person is one of
the most talented chefs ever

01:46.273 --> 01:50.110
to have graced
the MasterChef kitchen.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.213
Please welcome America's
MasterChef reigning champion...

01:57.184 --> 01:59.353
‐ Shaun!

01:59.353 --> 02:01.655
‐ Shaun!
‐ ( whoops )

02:01.655 --> 02:05.392

‐ This is so bad ass.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.728
‐ <i>It's Shaun.</i>
‐ Great to be back.

02:07.728 --> 02:11.565
We're seeing real live proof
that you can win this thing.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.899
What's up, everybody?

02:12.899 --> 02:17.571
We have a winner here.
This is very inspirational.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.439
‐ Welcome back to
the MasterChef kitchen.
‐ Thank you very much, Chef.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.074
What have you been up to?
Tell me.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.110
<i>I've done some amazing things</i>
<i>since winning "MasterChef."</i>

02:23.110 --> 02:26.246
I've been traveling the world,
been on the MasterChef cruise.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.181
But the most exciting
thing I've done

02:28.181 --> 02:30.250
is I have released
my very own cookbook,

02:30.250 --> 02:32.252
<i>and it is available</i>
<i>right now, Chef.</i>

02:32.252 --> 02:34.354
<i>I really wanted</i>
<i>to elevate home dining.</i>

02:34.354 --> 02:36.456
It's got to taste amazing,
it's got to look amazing,

02:36.456 --> 02:39.026
and, you know, you can blow
your friends and family away

02:39.026 --> 02:40.494
just by a couple
little techniques.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.995
Awesome.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.296
Do you know what
makes me even happier?

02:43.296 --> 02:46.667
Seeing your cookbook
next to mine on the shelf.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.102
<i>What an amazing book,</i>
<i>congratulations.</i>

02:49.102 --> 02:50.804
Thank you, Chef.

02:50.804 --> 02:54.174
All right, guys.
it's time for your next
mystery box challenge.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.945
Now, are you ready
to find out what's under
Shaun's mystery box?

02:58.945 --> 03:00.714
All:
Yes, Chef!

03:00.714 --> 03:03.717
‐ Shaun, you won three
mystery boxes yourself.
‐ Yes.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.885
Christina:
<i>Why don't you do the honors?</i>

03:04.885 --> 03:08.321
On the count of three,
lift those boxes.

03:08.321 --> 03:13.427
One, two, three,
lift!

03:13.427 --> 03:14.928
‐ Whoo!
‐ Yes.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.264
‐ Ooh‐wee.
‐ Beautiful.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.634
I've put together some
of my favorite ingredients
from my cook book.

03:20.634 --> 03:24.571
<i>Forelle pears, parsnips,</i>
<i>butternut squash,</i>

03:24.571 --> 03:28.508
and the protein
that won it all for me,
venison tenderloin.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.243
( laughs )
Yes!

03:30.243 --> 03:33.647
All right, everyone,
you are all in for
an incredible treat

03:33.647 --> 03:38.785
because tonight
Shaun will be cooking
alongside all of you.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.587
( cheering )

03:40.587 --> 03:42.989
That's awesome,
that's awesome.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.991
It's absolutely incredible
to have Shaun in the kitchen

03:44.991 --> 03:46.193
because he's been there.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.928
‐ Head to your station.
‐ Yes, Chef.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.363
Jeff:
<i>And I liken his journey</i>
<i>a little bit to my journey.</i>

03:50.363 --> 03:52.265
<i>I've been in the top three</i>
<i>more than anybody,</i>

03:52.265 --> 03:54.134
so seeing him right here,
right now,

03:54.134 --> 03:56.703
Shaun is motivating me
to just bring it.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.171
Oh, yeah.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.539
‐ Aarón: <i>All right, everyone.</i>
‐ Whoo!

03:59.539 --> 04:03.543
You will have 60 minutes
to make us a spectacular dish

04:03.543 --> 04:06.880
‐ using ingredients
that Shaun has selected.
‐ Oh, my God.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.381
To help bring
your dishes to life,

04:08.381 --> 04:10.383
<i>you'll also find</i>
<i>that staple pantry box.</i>

04:10.383 --> 04:12.753
<i>Remember to use those</i>
<i>ingredients wisely tonight.</i>

04:12.753 --> 04:16.289
‐ Is everyone ready to cook?
‐ All: Yes, Chef!

04:16.289 --> 04:19.726
Your 60 minutes starts...

04:19.726 --> 04:21.661
now.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.729
‐ <i>Let's go.</i>
‐ Whoo!

04:28.568 --> 04:32.239
Guys, how incredible is it
to have Shaun back in the
MasterChef kitchen?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.741
So exciting.
How elevated has
this guy gone

04:34.741 --> 04:38.078
<i>from an amateur home cook,</i>
<i>former DJ, to a pro?</i>

04:38.078 --> 04:41.081
He's right there behind them,
cooking the same basket.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.751
That must be such a source
of inspiration for these
home cooks.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.586
Whew.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.622
Shaun, it's so good
to have you back in
the MasterChef kitchen.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.757
‐ What does it feel like?
‐ It feels like I never left.

04:50.757 --> 04:51.858
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

04:51.858 --> 04:54.194
I'm doing an eight‐spice
venison loin.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.596
I'm gonna serve it over
a parsnip garlic puree,

04:56.596 --> 04:58.298
and I'm actually doing
a balsamic pear puree

04:58.298 --> 05:00.200
just to give it
a little bit of sweetness.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.536
‐ Nice, good luck.
‐ You got it.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.371
I've never
made venison before.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.206
Growing up in Boston,
we don't do a lot of huntin',

05:06.206 --> 05:10.076
but I'm gonna try and do
a pan‐seared venison,

05:10.076 --> 05:11.711
some roasted
Brussels sprouts,

05:11.711 --> 05:14.214
and a blackberry
in balsamic reduction.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.449
I haven't been
in the top three yet,

05:16.449 --> 05:18.084
but I'm thinking
today might be my day.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.056
I'm gonna do
a pan‐seared venison,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.559
but I don't know what that is,
that is, that is, or that is.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.994
I come from
a small town in Texas

05:27.994 --> 05:30.897
and I don't even think
we sell this stuff in
our grocery stores.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.265
I might not know
what nothin' is,

05:32.265 --> 05:34.334
but it'll taste good
when I get done.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.270
20 minutes gone,
40 minutes remaining, guys.

05:37.270 --> 05:40.073
‐ ( pot hissing )
‐ Ah, shut up, pot.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.742
‐ You all right, there?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.011
I'm just watching you.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.282
‐ Dino.
‐ How you doing, Chef?

05:49.282 --> 05:52.519
The look on your face
when Shaun walked
into the kitchen,

05:52.519 --> 05:53.587
priceless.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.322
Oh, my God,
I'm star struck.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.523
So, what are you
making tonight?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.592
I'm doing a herb ravioli.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.727
It's gonna be stuffed
with a Portobello,

06:00.727 --> 06:02.596
butternut squash,
and venison,

06:02.596 --> 06:05.065
and I'm gonna finish it off
with a honey mustard
cream sauce.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.033
It's very unorthodox,
but I think the taste

06:07.033 --> 06:08.468
is just gonna blow
your brains out, you know?

06:08.468 --> 06:10.770
‐ Yep.
‐ All right, Dino,
keep on it, good luck.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.875
Gordon:
<i>30 minutes remaining!</i>

06:14.875 --> 06:17.043
‐ Yachecia, tell me
about the dish.
‐ Yes, Chef.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.279
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Okay, so I'm doing
a pan‐seared venison

06:19.279 --> 06:21.381
with a blackberry sauce,

06:21.381 --> 06:24.084
and then a parsnip
and butternut squash puree.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.286
‐ Nice.
‐ I've never cooked
with venison before,

06:26.286 --> 06:28.889
so I'm praying all the way
through this, of course.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.959
‐ Wow, okay, great.
Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.061
‐ All right, Cate.
‐ Yes, Chefs.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.730
Christina:
<i>I can't imagine that's</i>
<i>the first piece of venison</i>

06:36.730 --> 06:38.565
‐ you've seen in your life.
‐ Absolutely not.

06:38.565 --> 06:42.168
I grew up hunting venison
with my whole entire
family in Illinois,

06:42.168 --> 06:44.104
so I'm in my wheelhouse.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.639
So tell me the dish, Cate.

06:45.639 --> 06:49.409
I am making a chili
and cinnamon rubbed venison,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.579
and then I did a little
reduced balsamic, pinot noir,

06:52.579 --> 06:55.448
and parsnip puree
that I'm gonna finish
with a little bit of nutmeg.

06:55.448 --> 06:59.619
Winner of this mystery box
gets a huge advantage.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.022
‐ Good luck.
‐ I am so excited.
Can't wait.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.624
Gordon:
<i>Just under 20 minutes</i>
<i>remaining.</i>

07:04.624 --> 07:07.227
<i>Let it shine, guys.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

07:09.729 --> 07:11.598
‐ All right, Miss Caitlin.
‐ Hi, how you guys doing?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.066
What are you
making tonight?

07:13.066 --> 07:15.635
<i>I'm making a spice</i>
<i>rubbed venison tenderloin</i>

07:15.635 --> 07:18.705
with butternut squash puree,
crispy Brussels sprout salad,

07:18.705 --> 07:20.941
and a blackberry compote
as the sauce.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.776
Have you cooked
venison tenderloin before?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.878
Back in Pittsburgh,
we're huge into deer hunting,

07:24.878 --> 07:27.747
so I'm familiar
with the flavors,
I'm familiar with the taste,

07:27.747 --> 07:29.983
and I think
I'm really gonna nail
this dish tonight.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.953
Wow us and wow Shaun
'cause he's judging
your dish, too.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.387
‐ Caitlin: <i>So amazing.</i>
‐ Good luck.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.755
Thank you.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.827
Gordon:
<i>Just over five minutes</i>
<i>to go, guys.</i>

07:40.827 --> 07:43.563
I'm glad that those
who've never cooked
with venison before

07:43.563 --> 07:45.165
<i>are coming out</i>
<i>of the park strong.</i>

07:45.165 --> 07:48.268
Yachecia, she is more
adventurous tonight
than ever before.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.771
She's serving this
incredible‐sounding
seared venison loin,

07:51.771 --> 07:53.173
so I'm expecting
great things from her.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.441
All right, all right.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.243
I think Cate has the ability
of making a beautiful dish.

07:57.243 --> 08:00.246
She has all these ingredients
that will pop on the plate.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.849
‐ 90 seconds remaining.
‐ Christina: <i>Gotta push.</i>

08:02.849 --> 08:04.184
Aarón:
<i>Ooh, that's beautiful.</i>

08:04.184 --> 08:05.618
Gordon: <i>Finesse,</i>
<i>let's go, Newton, come on.</i>

08:05.618 --> 08:07.020
Christina:
<i>Taste, taste, taste.</i>

08:07.020 --> 08:08.688
Gordon:
<i>You've got to start plating.</i>

08:08.688 --> 08:10.557
Christina:
<i>Guys, you want this advantage.</i>
<i>Make those dishes shine.</i>

08:10.557 --> 08:12.092
‐ Here we go.
‐ Push, guys!

08:12.092 --> 08:15.695
‐ Gordon: <i>Ten...</i>
‐ Judges: <i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>

08:15.695 --> 08:21.101
<i>six, five, four,</i>
<i>three, two, one...</i>

08:21.101 --> 08:23.937
‐ Gordon: And stop!
‐ Hands in the air!

08:23.937 --> 08:26.039
Yachecia: <i>Whoo!</i>

08:31.794 --> 08:35.631
Well done, everyone.
Tonight, you all had to make us
a spectacular dish

08:35.631 --> 08:38.300
using the ingredients
that Shaun selected.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.303
Shaun, as always,
an absolute pleasure
tonight to watch you work.

08:41.303 --> 08:45.407
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ And confirm your status
as the reigning MasterChef.

08:45.407 --> 08:51.013
Please bring that
amazing‐looking dish up
to the front, thank you.

08:51.013 --> 08:53.682
‐ Newton: Looks good.
‐ ( clapping )

08:56.185 --> 08:57.419
Gordon:
<i>Wow, amazing.</i>

08:57.419 --> 08:58.654
Right, describe
the dish, please.

08:58.654 --> 09:01.256
Shaun:
<i>So I have eight‐spiced</i>
<i>rub venison</i>

09:01.256 --> 09:03.292
<i>with parsnip</i>
<i>and garlic puree.</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:05.594
<i>Then I did a little spin</i>
<i>on a chimichurri</i>

09:05.594 --> 09:07.363
<i>with smoked arugula.</i>

09:07.363 --> 09:10.432
<i>There's also a pear puree</i>
<i>with balsamic vinegar.</i>

09:10.432 --> 09:12.134
Unbelievable, Shaun.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.335
Gosh.

09:13.335 --> 09:16.605
Shaun's dish looks amazing.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.274
Shaun, you have
outdone yourself.

09:19.274 --> 09:22.044
The delicate‐ness
of his deep fried pears,

09:22.044 --> 09:24.847
<i>the ruby redness</i>
<i>of his venison.</i>

09:24.847 --> 09:26.181
Aarón:
You have the perfect
combination

09:26.181 --> 09:27.783
of the creaminess
from the puree,

09:27.783 --> 09:29.618
<i>and the spices</i>
<i>have really blossomed.</i>

09:29.618 --> 09:31.954
The negative space
that he uses on his place...

09:31.954 --> 09:33.288
Look at that,
the black and the white.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.124
<i>...he's an art master.</i>

09:35.124 --> 09:37.226
He's operating
on a whole new level.

09:37.226 --> 09:40.863
Now that's how a MasterChef
perfects a loin of venison.
Well done, Shaun.

09:40.863 --> 09:43.132
Thank you very much, Chef.

09:43.132 --> 09:45.868
Now we've had the chance
to watch you cook

09:45.868 --> 09:48.971
and taste elements
from each of your dishes
as you put them together.

09:48.971 --> 09:52.474
<i>Three dishes in particular</i>
<i>stood out to us</i>

09:52.474 --> 09:54.643
<i>that we can't wait</i>
<i>to take a closer look at.</i>

09:54.643 --> 09:57.179
First dish we want
to bring forward

09:57.179 --> 10:01.083
<i>is from a home cook</i>
<i>who they were able to turn</i>
<i>their ingredients tonight</i>

10:01.083 --> 10:05.154
into a gorgeous dish
that made us quite proud.

10:05.154 --> 10:07.423
Step forward,
please, Caitlin.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.491
Caitlin:
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

10:09.491 --> 10:12.428
I've never been in the top three
of a mystery box challenge.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.663
<i>I'm ready to show everyone</i>
<i>else in this competition</i>

10:14.663 --> 10:17.733
that I'm a threat
and this proves it.

10:17.733 --> 10:20.536
Miss Caitlin,
let's get down to this dish.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.572
So, today we have
pan‐seared venison loin

10:23.572 --> 10:25.774
<i>with a butternut squash</i>
<i>parsnip puree,</i>

10:25.774 --> 10:28.010
<i>crispy Brussels sprout</i>
<i>and shallot salad</i>

10:28.010 --> 10:31.346
<i>with a sauce incorporating</i>
<i>blackberries, ginger,</i>
<i>and pears.</i>

10:33.449 --> 10:36.118
Christina:
<i>The cook on the venison,</i>
<i>a beautiful mid‐rare.</i>

10:36.118 --> 10:39.221
<i>I love what you did</i>
<i>with the Brussels sprouts‐‐</i>
<i>great complexity,</i>

10:39.221 --> 10:41.590
<i>and that parsnip</i>
<i>butternut squash puree,</i>

10:41.590 --> 10:43.125
it's luscious, it's deep.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.793
I think it'd look even more
stunning on a white plate,

10:44.793 --> 10:46.762
but I like that you're
really upping your game.

10:46.762 --> 10:49.598
Thank you, Chef.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.867
‐ Hey, Caitlin.
‐ Hi, Chef.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.569
So, it looks beautiful.

10:55.537 --> 10:56.772
And it tastes amazing.

10:56.772 --> 10:58.140
‐ Thank you.
‐ The venison's great.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.942
I mean, look at that.
That's a perfect cook.

10:59.942 --> 11:02.244
<i>The sauce, I think it works</i>
<i>beautifully with the venison.</i>

11:02.244 --> 11:05.347
Your puree could be
a little bit more pureed,
but it's a great dish.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.249
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.552
‐ ( clapping )
‐ Nice job, Caitlin.
Nice job.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.157
So, the second dish
that we'd like to
examine further,

11:15.157 --> 11:19.094
<i>this home cook</i>
<i>really cooked her venison</i>
<i>to perfection.</i>

11:19.094 --> 11:22.765
Let's see if a higher power
was watching over her.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.267
Yachecia,
please come forward.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.904
Whoo, hallelujah!
I'm in the top three
one more time.

11:28.904 --> 11:32.508
Being recognized
is just even more fuel
for the fire.

11:32.508 --> 11:35.010
<i>Everybody behind me</i>
<i>better look out.</i>

11:35.010 --> 11:36.245
<i>I didn't come</i>
<i>to this kitchen by myself.</i>

11:36.245 --> 11:37.746
<i>I know that God</i>
<i>is on my side,</i>

11:37.746 --> 11:40.749
so I got some steam
and some real muscle behind me.

11:40.749 --> 11:42.351
Miss Yachecia, can you
explain your dish real quick?

11:42.351 --> 11:44.753
Yachecia:
<i>It's a pan‐seared venison</i>

11:44.753 --> 11:47.422
<i>with butternut squash</i>
<i>and parsnip puree</i>

11:47.422 --> 11:50.425
<i>finished with a blackberry</i>
<i>sauce and Brussels sprout slaw.</i>

11:58.534 --> 12:01.737
Whoa, there are so many
high marks in this dish.

12:01.737 --> 12:05.741
<i>The flavor of the venison</i>
<i>itself, the coating,</i>
<i>the crust, it's delicious.</i>

12:05.741 --> 12:07.142
Thank you, Chef.

12:07.142 --> 12:08.877
Aarón:
<i>I think the puree's</i>
<i>kind of confused.</i>

12:08.877 --> 12:11.146
It doesn't know if it's
butternut squash puree
or parsnip.

12:11.146 --> 12:13.982
But we always screen
with meats that are very
aggressive in flavor,

12:13.982 --> 12:15.717
that are assertive
like venison,

12:15.717 --> 12:18.420
a relief, and this slaw,
something that's acidic,

12:18.420 --> 12:20.155
<i>definitely brings you there,</i>

12:20.155 --> 12:22.157
And that, for me,
is what makes this memorable.

12:22.157 --> 12:23.826
Yes, Chef.

12:27.763 --> 12:30.766
The flavor on the venison
is delicious.

12:30.766 --> 12:33.268
The sauce
is just sweet enough.

12:33.268 --> 12:34.570
<i>The slaw</i>
<i>is absolutely amazing.</i>

12:34.570 --> 12:36.572
You've got just enough
acidity in there.

12:36.572 --> 12:38.841
What I'd change about it
is work on a little bit
of finesse,

12:38.841 --> 12:41.877
maybe get one of the pastry
brushes and a nice swoop

12:41.877 --> 12:43.679
with a pastry brush
across the plate.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.181
‐ All in all, it's delicious.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

12:46.181 --> 12:47.516
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you, thank you.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.451
<i>‐ Nice job, Yachecia.</i>
<i>‐ Good job, Yachecia.</i>

12:54.223 --> 12:58.193
The third and final dish
we'd like to take a much
closer look at,

12:58.193 --> 13:00.362
<i>it's from someone</i>
<i>who went bold,</i>

13:00.362 --> 13:02.831
<i>and this individual</i>
<i>has definitely confirmed</i>

13:02.831 --> 13:06.134
<i>it is ladies' night in the</i>
<i>MasterChef kitchen tonight.</i>

13:06.134 --> 13:09.538
Please set forward, Cate.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.408
Yay!
Finally!

13:13.408 --> 13:16.144
Finally top three
in a mystery box challenge.

13:16.144 --> 13:19.748
<i>If there's</i>
<i>any box for me to win,</i>
<i>it's this mystery box.</i>

13:19.748 --> 13:25.320
I need to show the judges
that I have what it takes to
be in Shaun's shoes one day.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.322
Describe the dish, please.

13:27.322 --> 13:30.826
Cate:
<i>This is a spice</i>
<i>rubbed venison,</i>

13:30.826 --> 13:33.996
<i>celery root puree</i>
<i>with some caramelized shallots,</i>

13:33.996 --> 13:38.901
<i>glazed Thumbelina carrots</i>
<i>with parsnip chips</i>
<i>and a blackberry sauce.</i>

13:38.901 --> 13:43.071
I grew up hunting and fishing.
I have my deer permit already
for this year,

13:43.071 --> 13:45.507
so it's definitely something
I'm familiar with.

13:45.507 --> 13:47.175
Mm.

13:47.175 --> 13:48.677
Like it?

13:48.677 --> 13:50.679
Visually, it's like art.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.514
<i>One of the best‐tasting</i>
<i>dishes of the night.</i>

13:52.514 --> 13:54.216
<i>Venison's like butter.</i>

13:54.216 --> 13:56.251
I think you got
the composition right
in terms of the quantity

13:56.251 --> 13:57.786
'cause it shows restraint.

13:57.786 --> 13:59.955
It's a dish I'd put
on a tasting menu of mine.

13:59.955 --> 14:01.790
‐ Great job, well done.
‐ Thank you so much.

14:09.665 --> 14:12.734
It tastes a lot
like my finale dish.

14:12.734 --> 14:14.970
<i>Venison's cooked great.</i>
<i>I mean, look at that.</i>

14:14.970 --> 14:16.638
<i>The bright red in the middle</i>
<i>and then the brown ring</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

14:16.638 --> 14:18.640
<i>I love the caramelization</i>
<i>on the carrots,</i>

14:18.640 --> 14:19.975
<i>and the sauce is delicious.</i>

14:19.975 --> 14:21.209
What personally
would I do different?

14:21.209 --> 14:23.345
I'd be a little more
smooth with the puree,

14:23.345 --> 14:26.682
get a little paper towel
and just go around the edge
and give it that smooth edge.

14:26.682 --> 14:28.850
But it's delicious and you
knocked it out of the park.

14:28.850 --> 14:30.719
Thank you so much.

14:30.719 --> 14:32.821
‐ ( clapping )
‐ Good job.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.491
Thank you and congratulations.

14:36.491 --> 14:39.661
What's the best dish
of the night for you,
out of the three meals?

14:44.533 --> 14:47.736
Christina:
Ladies, you made
the four of us so proud.

14:47.736 --> 14:52.007
<i>Three MasterChef‐quality</i>
<i>venison dishes.</i>

14:52.007 --> 14:56.078
But there can only
be one winner tonight.

14:56.078 --> 14:59.848
And the home cook
with the best dish is...

15:02.317 --> 15:04.619
I'm gonna pass the honors
over to you, Shaun.

15:05.954 --> 15:07.789
Congratulations...

15:16.331 --> 15:19.234
The home cook
with the best dish is...

15:22.204 --> 15:25.640
I'm gonna pass the honors
over to you, Shaun.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.676
Congratulations...

15:30.512 --> 15:31.913
Cate.

15:31.913 --> 15:34.182
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Good job, girl.

15:36.318 --> 15:41.656
Now, I would like all of you
to join us in thanking
our current MasterChef

15:41.656 --> 15:43.325
for leaving the bright lights
of Vegas to be here

15:43.325 --> 15:45.894
to light up
this incredible kitchen.

15:45.894 --> 15:48.563
‐ Thank you, Shaun!
‐ Thank you, guys!

15:48.563 --> 15:52.601
To have Shaun back here,
it was so exciting.

15:52.601 --> 15:55.103
To see his journey
come full circle,

15:55.103 --> 15:56.505
<i>it's such an inspiration.</i>

15:56.505 --> 15:59.841
‐ Good luck, everybody!
‐ Gordon: <i>Thank you, Shaun.</i>

16:01.343 --> 16:04.613
Cate, please come stand here,
thank you.

16:04.613 --> 16:08.450
Now, first of all, Cate,
you are safe from elimination.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.118
But that's not all.

16:10.118 --> 16:14.823
The entire competition
is about to be placed
in your hands.

16:14.823 --> 16:17.959
You don't get to choose
the ingredient,

16:17.959 --> 16:23.832
but you will get to decide
what kind of dish each
home cook has to make.

16:23.832 --> 16:25.801
Every home cook tonight
will be cooking

16:25.801 --> 16:27.636
with an ingredient
that the culinary world

16:27.636 --> 16:29.971
<i>holds in the highest regard.</i>

16:37.579 --> 16:41.083
From curries to cakes,
there are endless possibilities

16:41.083 --> 16:44.386
with this delicious,
magical ingredient.

16:48.657 --> 16:51.526
The almighty coconut.

16:51.526 --> 16:53.995
‐ Coconut!
‐ ( woman gasps )

16:53.995 --> 16:58.333
Tonight, you all have to make
an incredible dish starring...

16:58.333 --> 17:01.269
the beautiful coconut.

17:01.269 --> 17:03.138
I'm so excited it's coconut.

17:03.138 --> 17:06.108
<i>Coconut goes</i>
<i>in every Indian dish,</i>
<i>every Jamaican dish,</i>

17:06.108 --> 17:08.343
<i>every African dish</i>
<i>I cook at home for my family.</i>

17:08.343 --> 17:11.113
Coconut is in everything.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.281
All right, you know
what you're cooking with,

17:13.281 --> 17:15.484
but one decision
is not yours.

17:15.484 --> 17:17.619
<i>And that's what type</i>
<i>of dish you'll be making.</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:19.654
Is it savory or sweet?

17:19.654 --> 17:23.158
That is a decision Cate
will be making for you.

17:23.158 --> 17:24.793
<i>If Cate hands you</i>
<i>a savory basket,</i>

17:24.793 --> 17:26.294
<i>you will have</i>
<i>to make a savory dish.</i>

17:26.294 --> 17:29.297
On the other hand,
if Cate hands you
a sweet basket,

17:29.297 --> 17:31.199
<i>you'll have to make</i>
<i>a sweet one.</i>

17:31.199 --> 17:34.035
The home cook who fails
to conquer this coconut
challenge

17:34.035 --> 17:35.804
<i>will be going home.</i>

17:35.804 --> 17:38.974
Everyone, line up
for your baskets.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.977
Jeff, I'd love to make
your decision for you.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.680
I think you've already
made the decision already.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.049
You know that I would love
to go with something...

17:48.049 --> 17:50.018
‐ Savory.
‐ Absolutely.

17:50.018 --> 17:51.853
So, because I want
to sabotage you...

17:51.853 --> 17:53.655
( laughs )

17:53.655 --> 17:56.691
I'm gonna go with
this sweet pink basket
that matches your shirt.

17:56.691 --> 17:57.993
Why, thank you.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.094
Jeff, head
into the pantry.

17:59.094 --> 18:01.029
Yachecia, what are you
feeling tonight?

18:01.029 --> 18:04.499
‐ Savory.
‐ I'm gonna give you
this sweet basket.

18:04.499 --> 18:07.335
My strategy for this advantage
is to just give

18:07.335 --> 18:11.940
my toughest competitors
the basket that I think
is going to trip them up.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.475
I would definitely
go with sweet.

18:13.475 --> 18:15.310
You're gonna get
the savory.

18:15.310 --> 18:18.113
Eboni, what basket
speaks to you more?

18:18.113 --> 18:19.948
Savory.

18:19.948 --> 18:21.616
‐ If looks could kill...
‐ <i>I'd be dead.</i>

18:21.616 --> 18:23.185
‐ ...you'd be dead right now.
‐ Yeah, for sure.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.619
Thank God you don't
live in Chicago.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.788
‐ Wait, I do live in Chicago.
‐ Right.

18:26.788 --> 18:29.624
‐ I'm gonna give you savory.
‐ Thank you, Cate.

18:29.624 --> 18:30.725
Some of the other
competitors...

18:30.725 --> 18:32.494
I really want
the sweet basket.

18:32.494 --> 18:34.729
‐ <i>...I'm not worried about...</i>
‐ Thank you, dear.

18:34.729 --> 18:36.965
<i>so I just want to give them</i>
<i>a basket that they want.</i>

18:36.965 --> 18:39.234
‐ Thank you, ma'am.
‐ Thank you so much.

18:39.234 --> 18:40.802
‐ Get it, girl.
‐ Final basket.

18:40.802 --> 18:44.506
Jason, you're so good
at savory and finesse

18:44.506 --> 18:49.211
that I want to see
you trip up and choke
on this sweet basket.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.147
I'm really hoping
that my strategy pays off.

18:52.147 --> 18:56.351
Cate, well done.
Now, head on up to
the safety of the balcony.

18:56.351 --> 18:58.820
This is a competition
and there only can
be one winner,

18:58.820 --> 19:03.458
so to get a good chef
out of the way is my goal today.

19:07.295 --> 19:08.964
‐ Oh, God.
‐ <i>You see milk?</i>

19:08.964 --> 19:11.166
I'm looking for coconut oil.
Where is it?

19:11.166 --> 19:14.436
Oh, my God.
Everything you can think
of is coconut.

19:14.436 --> 19:17.439
<i>Coconut flour, coconut flakes,</i>
<i>coconut milk,</i>

19:17.439 --> 19:20.976
<i>coconut sugar.</i>
<i>Coconut, coconut,</i>
<i>coconut, coconut.</i>

19:20.976 --> 19:22.711
I'm gonna nail this.

19:22.711 --> 19:24.546
Coconut oil's over here.

19:24.546 --> 19:27.215
My daughter makes
a cream cheese pie.

19:27.215 --> 19:28.984
<i>So I'm probably gonna</i>
<i>take inspiration from that.</i>

19:28.984 --> 19:31.119
I'm gonna make
a coconut lime tart

19:31.119 --> 19:32.787
and I'm gonna
finish that off

19:32.787 --> 19:35.957
with some coconut rum
in raspberry sauce,

19:35.957 --> 19:38.460
and I see everything
that I need to make it happen.

19:38.460 --> 19:41.396
Aarón:
<i>Whoa, look at those baskets</i>
<i>filled to the brim.</i>

19:41.396 --> 19:43.665
Good luck, everyone.

19:44.799 --> 19:46.134
Okay.

19:46.134 --> 19:48.069
You all will have
just one hour

19:48.069 --> 19:51.339
to make us one incredible
coconut dish.

19:51.339 --> 19:54.009
‐ Now, is everybody ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

19:54.009 --> 19:57.979
Your 60 minutes starts...

19:57.979 --> 19:59.180
now.

19:59.180 --> 20:00.649
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:04.319 --> 20:05.887
Jeff:
<i>Cate gave me the sweet dish.</i>

20:05.887 --> 20:08.990
Now, this Tampa boy is gonna
be doing a coconut cupcake

20:08.990 --> 20:12.227
<i>with coconut flour,</i>
<i>a coconut rum raspberry</i>
<i>chocolate ganache,</i>

20:12.227 --> 20:14.596
<i>and candied</i>
<i>chopped‐up almonds.</i>

20:14.596 --> 20:17.198
I'm not a big baker,
so this one is gonna be
a tougher one for me,

20:17.198 --> 20:19.834
but I'm gonna do my best
and just see where it goes
and takes me.

20:23.505 --> 20:25.707
So Cate assigned me
to be a savory dish

20:25.707 --> 20:28.076
starring coconut,
which I'm super excited about.

20:28.076 --> 20:31.513
I'm doing shredded pork butt
over coconut rice pilaf

20:31.513 --> 20:34.749
and a side of broccolini
tossed with some coconut
vinegar dressing.

20:34.749 --> 20:39.254
Coconut is a super healthy
form of fat and other nutrients,

20:39.254 --> 20:41.022
and as a dancer,
I'm always looking

20:41.022 --> 20:43.258
for the best way to fuel
what I love, which is dance.

20:43.258 --> 20:44.893
Get it, girl.

20:47.295 --> 20:49.764
Coconut is so diverse.

20:49.764 --> 20:52.233
Christina:
<i>These home cooks know</i>
<i>that to be a true MasterChef,</i>

20:52.233 --> 20:55.537
<i>you have to master both</i>
<i>the sweet and the savory.</i>

20:55.537 --> 20:57.205
‐ It's a great barometer...
‐ Sure.

20:57.205 --> 20:59.074
...to see how these
home cooks are progressing

20:59.074 --> 21:01.476
<i>and learning</i>
<i>through this process.</i>

21:01.476 --> 21:03.978
That's some kinda good
right there, boy.

21:07.148 --> 21:09.084
Cate gave me savory,

21:09.084 --> 21:12.320
so I'm gonna do a pan‐seared
coconut crusted snapper.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.090
Then I'm making a coconut
kaffir lime beurre blanc

21:15.090 --> 21:17.525
and avocado, pineapple,
habanero sauce

21:17.525 --> 21:18.860
with a little
bit of coconut in it.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.762
I'm confident.
I'm not going home tonight.

21:20.762 --> 21:22.097
This is not working out.

21:27.168 --> 21:28.603
Smells good already.

21:28.603 --> 21:30.338
‐ Right, Daniel.
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:30.338 --> 21:32.273
‐ Cate gave you...
‐ The savory basket.

21:32.273 --> 21:33.441
Right, what are you doing?

21:33.441 --> 21:35.944
I'm going to be making
a coconut seafood stew.

21:35.944 --> 21:37.345
‐ Okay.
‐ <i>I saw the lobster.</i>

21:37.345 --> 21:38.780
It's very New England.
I know how to handle
the lobster.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.849
‐ Love that.
‐ I got some beautiful
vegetables.

21:40.849 --> 21:42.350
I got some pepper,
some carrots, and some corn,

21:42.350 --> 21:43.852
<i>give it a little bite,</i>
<i>a little bit of crunch.</i>

21:43.852 --> 21:46.421
And in the middle,
I'm gonna do a little
bed of coconut rice

21:46.421 --> 21:48.423
with a little bit
of shaved coconut in there.

21:48.423 --> 21:50.392
‐ Wow.
‐ Coconut definitely not one
of my favorite ingredients.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.193
The most familiar I am
with it is, uh, you know,

21:52.193 --> 21:55.096
when my girlfriend
rubs it in my hair for me
to get the tangles out.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.399
‐ Wow, good luck.
‐ Thank you very much, Chef.

21:59.801 --> 22:02.971
Miss Eboni, you got
a savory basket from Cate.

22:02.971 --> 22:05.306
‐ Yeah.
‐ Now what's
going on with that?

22:05.306 --> 22:07.308
I'm gonna make
a homemade spicy curry.

22:07.308 --> 22:10.645
I'm doing coconut lobster
and shrimp over coconut rice.

22:10.645 --> 22:12.414
I'm doing coconut
fried plantains

22:12.414 --> 22:15.650
and I'm gonna do
cabbage and carrots
with coconut water on top.

22:15.650 --> 22:16.985
Do you make curries
quite often?

22:16.985 --> 22:18.253
Where does this
inspiration come from?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.921
All the time. My husband.
He's Indian and Jamaican,

22:19.921 --> 22:23.158
so I was taught how
to make curry from his
grandmother and all his aunts.

22:23.158 --> 22:26.060
‐ Really?
‐ So, if I was
to crack right now,

22:26.060 --> 22:27.762
it'd be a serious problem.

22:27.762 --> 22:29.597
‐ Best of luck to you.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

22:33.935 --> 22:37.439
Gordon:
<i>Less than 30 minutes</i>
<i>to go, guys.</i>

22:37.439 --> 22:39.941
Remember, elimination
is on the line.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.444
‐ Reba, how you feeling?
‐ I feel good.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.213
‐ Cate gave me savory.
‐ Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

22:45.213 --> 22:47.615
I am doing a coconut
battered shrimp

22:47.615 --> 22:50.585
with coconut‐flavored
asparagus and a coconut sauce.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.187
<i>Okay, great.</i>
<i>Let's go home.</i>

22:52.187 --> 22:53.888
‐ Husband's name?
What's his name?
‐ Wayne.

22:53.888 --> 22:55.557
When's the last time
you and Wayne went
shopping for coconuts?

22:55.557 --> 22:57.058
Never.

22:57.058 --> 22:59.027
‐ Have you ever cooked
a dish with coconut?
‐ Nope.

22:59.027 --> 23:02.630
The most we've done is...

23:02.630 --> 23:04.866
one time we had a drink
served in a coconut.

23:04.866 --> 23:08.403
‐ Oh, you had a drink served...
‐ Yes. It was good.

23:08.403 --> 23:09.804
I drunk it
and kept the coconut.

23:09.804 --> 23:11.639
I still got
the coconut shell
at the house.

23:11.639 --> 23:13.842
‐ Good luck.
Can't wait to taste it.
‐ Thank you, sir.

23:17.645 --> 23:18.980
<i>( Jeff sighs )</i>
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:22.083
These cupcakes suck.
( bleep )

23:22.083 --> 23:24.152
Jeff:
<i>I'm screwed right now.</i>
<i>My cupcakes aren't rising.</i>

23:24.152 --> 23:26.087
My cupcakes don't look
like a cupcake.

23:26.087 --> 23:28.823
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

23:28.823 --> 23:30.692
( sighs, bleeps )
What can I do?
What can I do?

23:30.692 --> 23:33.394
‐ What is Jeff doing?
‐ Christina: <i>Jeff seems</i>
<i>like he's given up.</i>

23:33.394 --> 23:35.497
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.564
Jeff can't bake.

23:36.564 --> 23:37.932
( bleep )

23:37.932 --> 23:39.367
Same thing happened
last challenge.

23:39.367 --> 23:41.236
<i>His cannoli was terrible.</i>

23:41.236 --> 23:44.172
<i>He looks like he has</i>
<i>one foot on that plane</i>
<i>back home to Tampa.</i>

23:44.172 --> 23:47.842
‐ Newton: <i>Don't worry, Jeff.</i>
<i>You got it.</i>
‐ I don't. My bags are packed.

23:47.842 --> 23:49.577
Thank you.

23:56.837 --> 23:58.639
<i>( Jeff sighs )</i>
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

23:58.639 --> 24:00.274
These cupcakes suck.
( bleep ).

24:00.274 --> 24:03.043
‐ <i>Pack the bags.</i>
‐ What is Jeff doing?

24:03.043 --> 24:04.478
Christina:
<i>Jeff seems like</i>
<i>he's given up.</i>

24:04.478 --> 24:07.548
I'm looking at my cupcakes
in the oven right now.

24:07.548 --> 24:09.049
<i>They don't look</i>
<i>like a cupcake.</i>

24:09.049 --> 24:10.884
What can I do?
What can I do?

24:10.884 --> 24:12.720
Jeff:
<i>I'm freaking out right now</i>
<i>because there's no chance</i>

24:12.720 --> 24:15.389
that this cupcake
is salvageable right now.

24:15.389 --> 24:16.991
( sighs )

24:16.991 --> 24:18.726
‐ All right, Jeff,
talk to me.
‐ Hi.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.728
‐ What do you got
going on here?
‐ These cupcakes stink.

24:20.728 --> 24:23.330
Let's talk.
Cake gone awry
is no problem.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.099
It's just about
changing direction.

24:25.099 --> 24:28.335
The batter's great,
it's just not coming
all together and baking.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.504
<i>Think about how</i>
<i>you'd plate a savory dish</i>

24:30.504 --> 24:33.240
‐ <i>and plate a dessert</i>
<i>like that.</i>
‐ Okay.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.576
‐ But you gotta start
making decisions, yeah?
‐ Yeah, exactly.

24:35.576 --> 24:37.578
<i>So, what are we</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

24:37.578 --> 24:40.614
I'm gonna
put the, uh...

24:40.614 --> 24:42.783
‐ I'm gonna actually do
a deconstructed cupcake.
‐ Okay.

24:42.783 --> 24:44.918
<i>Still weave</i>
<i>all the ingredients</i>
<i>that I was going for,</i>

24:44.918 --> 24:46.920
‐ kind of just build
upwards to it there.
‐ Okay.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.656
Have a nice little bit
of that layer of the chocolate

24:48.656 --> 24:50.190
to it there
so it kind of absorbs,

24:50.190 --> 24:53.127
almost like a glue
for the toasted coconut,

24:53.127 --> 24:55.596
and then that nice
candied almond to it there.

24:55.596 --> 24:57.598
Okay, start thinking
about presentation.

24:57.598 --> 24:58.966
Sounds like a plan,
I really will.

24:58.966 --> 25:00.601
‐ Go.
‐ Thank you so very much.

25:03.070 --> 25:04.605
Dino, how you feeling?

25:04.605 --> 25:06.106
Dino:
<i>I think Cate thought</i>
<i>she was messing with me</i>

25:06.106 --> 25:07.374
by throwing me
the pink basket,

25:07.374 --> 25:09.376
but, one,
I look good in pink,
I look good with pink,

25:09.376 --> 25:12.146
and, two, I do kind of
know my desserts.

25:12.146 --> 25:13.380
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

25:13.380 --> 25:14.581
I'm doing
a coconut cream puff

25:14.581 --> 25:16.550
and I made
a pate a choux out
of the coconut flour.

25:16.550 --> 25:18.786
‐ Wow.
‐ And I'm filling it
with a coconut rum

25:18.786 --> 25:20.054
mascarpone filling.

25:20.054 --> 25:21.822
And I have a chocolate
coconut garnish right here.

25:21.822 --> 25:24.925
Sounds amazing.
Can you get that pate a choux
cooked in that time?

25:24.925 --> 25:27.061
Oh, I'm really hoping.
I got it on high heat
right now.

25:27.061 --> 25:28.896
Yeah, and then you gotta
get it cooled down
and then stuffed, right?

25:28.896 --> 25:30.431
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Confident you can
win this?

25:30.431 --> 25:31.598
I really hope so.
Yes, Chef.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.267
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

25:35.736 --> 25:38.439
Gordon:
<i>Just over eight minutes to go.</i>

25:38.439 --> 25:39.773
‐ Wow.
‐ Aarón: <i>What are you</i>
<i>seeing out there?</i>

25:39.773 --> 25:41.742
Gordon:
<i>Daniel's doing</i>
<i>a seafood curry</i>

25:41.742 --> 25:43.477
<i>using the shells</i>
<i>from the lobster.</i>

25:43.477 --> 25:45.913
‐ Outstanding.
‐ And then getting
that amazing flavor

25:45.913 --> 25:48.082
<i>through that coconut</i>
<i>spiced broth.</i>

25:48.082 --> 25:49.950
‐ Christina: <i>Very smart.</i>
‐ Doing good, feeling good.

25:49.950 --> 25:51.485
I gotta say, I'm a little
nervous about Jeff.

25:51.485 --> 25:52.786
Gordon:
<i>Jeff is down in the dumps.</i>

25:52.786 --> 25:54.588
<i>He's not happy</i>
<i>with those cupcakes.</i>

25:54.588 --> 25:56.090
<i>However, he's back</i>
<i>on his feet.</i>

25:56.090 --> 25:57.658
This could be
the greatest comeback

25:57.658 --> 26:00.461
or the greatest tragedy
because Jeff could be
going home tonight.

26:00.461 --> 26:03.197
( mumbling )

26:03.197 --> 26:05.365
Gordon:
<i>90 seconds remaining.</i>

26:05.365 --> 26:07.801
You gotta move, Jeff.
You gotta finish
that dish for me.

26:07.801 --> 26:09.636
Aarón:
<i>Come on, Jeff.</i>

26:09.636 --> 26:11.305
‐ Gordon: <i>Finesse,</i>
<i>let's go, Newton!</i>
‐ Aarón: <i>Let's go, Dino.</i>

26:11.305 --> 26:12.406
Christina:
<i>Taste, taste, taste.</i>

26:12.406 --> 26:13.807
<i>Let's go now, Eboni.</i>

26:13.807 --> 26:16.543
Gordon:
<i>Your last 15 seconds.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

26:16.543 --> 26:18.212
‐ <i>10!</i>
‐ Christina: <i>Make it nice!</i>

26:18.212 --> 26:20.547
All judges:
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

26:20.547 --> 26:25.552
<i>six, five, four,</i>
<i>three, two, one.</i>

26:25.552 --> 26:28.555
‐ Aarón: <i>That's it!</i>
‐ Christina: <i>Hands in the air!</i>

26:28.555 --> 26:30.224
Wow.

26:30.224 --> 26:31.992
Yes.

26:31.992 --> 26:35.729
Now we want to see
what all of you
potential MasterChefs

26:35.729 --> 26:38.799
did with that simple,
versatile ingredient.

26:38.799 --> 26:41.335
First up, Dino, please.
Thank you.

26:41.335 --> 26:43.637
‐ Come on, Dino.
‐ Come on, Dino.

26:43.637 --> 26:46.240
Dino: <i>I'm really hopin'</i>
<i>and prayin' that the pate</i>
<i>a choux is cooked.</i>

26:46.240 --> 26:48.942
I am literally
stressed out right now,

26:48.942 --> 26:51.411
to the point where I am
about to have a panic attack.

26:51.411 --> 26:52.946
( exhales )

26:52.946 --> 26:55.449
Cate, up on the balcony,
gave you the pink basket.

26:55.449 --> 26:56.917
Yeah.

26:56.917 --> 26:59.653
What‐‐ what is that?

26:59.653 --> 27:00.754
( snickers )

27:00.754 --> 27:02.189
Dino:
<i>It's a coconut cream puff</i>

27:02.189 --> 27:06.226
<i>and the filling</i>
<i>is a Earl Gray chocolate</i>
<i>coconut cream</i>

27:06.226 --> 27:07.728
<i>with a little bit of rum.</i>

27:07.728 --> 27:10.030
Am I right in saying
it's sat on a coconut?

27:10.030 --> 27:12.866
And what's all the soil
on the outside?

27:12.866 --> 27:16.737
This is a mix, coconut
and dark chocolate crumbles.

27:16.737 --> 27:18.639
It looks like the remains
of my nana's ashes.

27:18.639 --> 27:21.909
I wanted them to look like ashes
'cause I wanted to make it
look sort of like a volcano.

27:21.909 --> 27:25.579
'Cause you think island,
you think tropical
'cause of the coconut,

27:25.579 --> 27:28.882
‐ <i>so I wanted to...</i>
‐ Gordon: <i>Yeah, I can't</i>
<i>honestly tell</i>

27:28.882 --> 27:32.719
if this is gonna be
absolutely shockingly bad
or really light and exciting.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.822
Let's get in there,
shall we?

27:34.822 --> 27:36.390
How long were the puffs
in the oven?

27:36.390 --> 27:38.225
Just long enough
to come out all right.

27:38.225 --> 27:39.560
How did you get
the coconut in there?

27:39.560 --> 27:42.095
I made the pate a choux
out of two parts AP flour,

27:42.095 --> 27:43.397
<i>one part coconut flour.</i>

27:43.397 --> 27:46.667
Instead of
using regular sugar,
I used coconut sugar.

27:50.103 --> 27:52.172
Dino...

27:52.172 --> 27:55.776
this dish sums up you.

27:57.311 --> 28:00.414
It's weirdly delicious.

28:00.414 --> 28:02.883
<i>It's got that light,</i>
<i>creamy texture.</i>

28:02.883 --> 28:04.952
<i>I mean, really stunning.</i>
<i>Restaurant quality.</i>

28:04.952 --> 28:07.521
<i>Great filling,</i>
<i>perfect consistency.</i>

28:07.521 --> 28:10.557
<i>It's light, creamy,</i>
<i>it's incredibly sumptuous.</i>

28:10.557 --> 28:12.359
<i>The chocolate,</i>
<i>it's elevated.</i>

28:12.359 --> 28:13.560
<i>What would I change?</i>

28:13.560 --> 28:15.929
Hollow out a little bit
more of the cream puff

28:15.929 --> 28:18.365
and get more of
that cream inside.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.100
I don't know,
I think there's gonna be
a lot of people

28:20.100 --> 28:21.702
<i>after your own creation.</i>

28:21.702 --> 28:23.704
Delicious.

28:23.704 --> 28:24.705
‐ Chef, thank you.
‐ Honestly.

28:24.705 --> 28:26.139
Thank you.

28:26.139 --> 28:29.209
Dino, you've got
this incredible expression

28:29.209 --> 28:31.311
of food as a form of art.

28:31.311 --> 28:33.113
When I was growing up,
me and my stepfather

28:33.113 --> 28:34.982
used to hang out
at my grandmother's house.

28:34.982 --> 28:36.984
<i>We didn't have television,</i>
<i>we didn't have video games</i>
<i>like everybody,</i>

28:36.984 --> 28:39.720
<i>so he taught me to draw,</i>
<i>so I've been an artist</i>

28:39.720 --> 28:43.724
since I was, like, able
to hold a pencil.

28:43.724 --> 28:45.893
‐ It's delicious.
‐ Thank you so much.

28:45.893 --> 28:49.296
<i>It's baked beautifully.</i>
<i>Not too dense, not too light.</i>

28:49.296 --> 28:52.299
<i>Filling's delicious.</i>
<i>It's nice and smooth</i>
<i>and creamy.</i>

28:52.299 --> 28:54.568
It keeps going in between
chocolate and coconut.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.503
<i>It's bitter, it's sweet,</i>
<i>it's nutty.</i>

28:56.503 --> 28:58.772
<i>You clearly let</i>
<i>your imagination run wild.</i>

28:58.772 --> 29:00.974
Buddy, I'd be scared
for anyone else out there.

29:00.974 --> 29:02.376
Thank you.

29:02.376 --> 29:04.678
Nice job.
Congratulations.

29:04.678 --> 29:07.014
‐ Good job, Dino.
‐ Good job, Dino.

29:07.014 --> 29:09.683
( exhales )

29:09.683 --> 29:11.585
Next up, Jeff, please.
Thank you.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.888
Jeff:
<i>Clearly, that</i>
<i>was a tough challenge.</i>

29:14.888 --> 29:18.025
I didn't get a cupcake
the way that I wanted a cupcake,

29:18.025 --> 29:19.927
<i>so I went a little abstract.</i>

29:19.927 --> 29:21.695
It may not be
the prettiest dessert,

29:21.695 --> 29:23.230
<i>but coconut was the star,</i>

29:23.230 --> 29:25.132
coconut is shining
in my dish.

29:25.132 --> 29:28.869
Cate, when you gave Jeff
the pink basket,

29:28.869 --> 29:32.272
did you honestly believe
it would be this bad?

29:32.272 --> 29:35.709
Um, no, Chef.
He tried to bake
with coconut flour.

29:35.709 --> 29:38.378
Coconut flour just absorbs
and has no gluten.

29:38.378 --> 29:41.715
It's just‐‐ it looks
like it's crumbled and
put back together.

29:41.715 --> 29:43.216
Describe the dish,
please, Jeff.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.052
Jeff:
<i>So, what I have</i>
<i>here for you, Chef,</i>

29:45.052 --> 29:47.321
<i>is a deconstructed</i>
<i>coconut cupcake</i>

29:47.321 --> 29:50.157
<i>with a toasted</i>
<i>and candied spiced almond,</i>

29:50.157 --> 29:51.959
raspberry crumble.

29:51.959 --> 29:54.895
I decided to have
the deconstructed cupcake‐‐

29:54.895 --> 29:56.229
Uh, listen.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.731
I'm sick to death
of the word "deconstructed"

29:57.731 --> 30:01.601
because it's just a word
to cover up the actual mess.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.910
( sighs )

30:09.910 --> 30:12.913
I see what you've done
in this competition.

30:12.913 --> 30:15.148
<i>I've seen how</i>
<i>determined you are.</i>

30:15.148 --> 30:18.418
And then I taste this.
It's just‐‐ I got two
different Jeff's tonight.

30:18.418 --> 30:19.987
Yes, you do.

30:19.987 --> 30:23.090
The mix is cooked,
but it tastes dreadful.

30:23.090 --> 30:24.925
And the garnish
is just confusing.

30:24.925 --> 30:28.161
The potential was there,
but that is your worst
performance.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.698
Come here.

30:31.698 --> 30:35.535
‐ Are you done?
‐ Am I done?

30:35.535 --> 30:39.873
I got a lot more to give,
and my journey is not gonna
be over because of this.

30:39.873 --> 30:41.475
<i>I'm gonna come back</i>
<i>even stronger</i>

30:41.475 --> 30:44.277
with a better performance
and a better dish.

30:44.277 --> 30:49.883
My problem is, Jeff,
I don't think you will
have another chance.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.707
Come here.

30:58.707 --> 31:02.478
‐ Are you done?
‐ Am I done?

31:02.478 --> 31:04.413
I got a lot more to give.

31:04.413 --> 31:05.848
<i>I'm gonna come back</i>
<i>even stronger</i>

31:05.848 --> 31:09.385
with a better performance
and a better dish.

31:09.385 --> 31:13.822
My problem is, Jeff,
I don't think you will
have another chance.

31:16.158 --> 31:19.161
I took a chance
on coconut flour.
That's it.

31:19.161 --> 31:21.363
<i>One mistake</i>
<i>can't send me home.</i>

31:21.363 --> 31:25.234
<i>I just hope the judges</i>
<i>appreciate that I didn't</i>
<i>give up.</i>

31:25.234 --> 31:26.869
Aarón:
<i>Next up, please</i>
<i>step forward, Eboni.</i>

31:26.869 --> 31:29.838
‐ Whoo‐hoo!
‐ Go, Eboni!

31:29.838 --> 31:31.707
I'm feeling real confident
about my dish.

31:31.707 --> 31:33.375
<i>I know the flavors</i>
<i>are all there.</i>

31:33.375 --> 31:36.378
This is me and my husband's
culture right on the plate.

31:36.378 --> 31:38.247
So, your girl got this.

31:38.247 --> 31:41.050
So, Cate gave you
a savory basket, correct?

31:41.050 --> 31:43.218
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ <i>Describe your dish, please.</i>

31:43.218 --> 31:45.854
Eboni:
<i>I made coconut Indian curry.</i>

31:45.854 --> 31:48.023
<i>I did coconut</i>
<i>and lemongrass rice.</i>

31:48.023 --> 31:51.260
<i>I also did a coconut,</i>
<i>cabbage, and carrot</i>

31:51.260 --> 31:55.764
and then I made sweet plantains
that I salted and fried
in coconut oil.

31:55.764 --> 31:57.700
What are some
of the seasonings
that you used?

31:57.700 --> 32:00.035
I used turmeric,
I used coriander,

32:00.035 --> 32:02.571
I used allspice,
I used garlic.

32:02.571 --> 32:05.040
I used two different
types of curry.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.143
I think the curry
is dynamite.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.712
<i>The lobster's</i>
<i>cooked perfectly.</i>

32:09.712 --> 32:11.046
<i>The rice is delicious.</i>

32:11.046 --> 32:12.981
<i>It has a beautiful</i>
<i>backdrop of the coconut.</i>

32:12.981 --> 32:16.051
And these
plantains, textbook.
That's how you do it.

32:16.051 --> 32:18.020
But this dish needs
a lot more herbs,

32:18.020 --> 32:20.155
squeeze of lime,
kind of wake up the dish.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.857
But the curry, dynamite.

32:26.061 --> 32:27.663
I think that
the curry is delicious.

32:27.663 --> 32:30.532
<i>There's a great heat</i>
<i>to it, which I love.</i>

32:30.532 --> 32:33.369
<i>Plantains,</i>
<i>they're full of flavor.</i>

32:33.369 --> 32:36.839
The cabbage and carrots bring
down the elegance of the dish

32:36.839 --> 32:38.040
that I think
you were going for.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.209
<i>But, overall,</i>
<i>really strong effort.</i>

32:40.209 --> 32:42.745
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Good job.

32:44.113 --> 32:46.682
Good job, Eb.

32:46.682 --> 32:49.051
Next up, Newton, please.
Thank you.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.523
<i>Cate gave you savory.</i>
<i>Describe the dish.</i>

32:54.523 --> 32:56.892
Newton:
<i>Pan‐seared coconut</i>
<i>crusted snapper</i>

32:56.892 --> 32:59.027
<i>with a sticky confetti rice,</i>

32:59.027 --> 33:01.463
<i>a coconut kaffir lime</i>
<i>beurre blanc,</i>

33:01.463 --> 33:04.633
<i>and then I did a avocado,</i>
<i>pineapple, habanero sauce</i>

33:04.633 --> 33:06.135
with a little bit
of coconut in it.

33:06.135 --> 33:10.372
It looks like I've just
rocked up at a $5 buffet
table, Newton.

33:13.008 --> 33:15.811
The actual cook on the fish,
it's moist, it's glistening.

33:15.811 --> 33:18.013
The mess around
the outside is a joke.

33:18.013 --> 33:21.016
<i>Buerre blanc with</i>
<i>the Mexico invasion.</i>

33:21.016 --> 33:23.051
<i>Chinese with</i>
<i>the sticky rice,</i>

33:23.051 --> 33:26.588
<i>and Katmandu with</i>
<i>the coconut crusted snapper.</i>

33:26.588 --> 33:28.323
I'm just‐‐ I'm confused.

33:28.323 --> 33:30.392
<i>You're taking me</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

33:30.392 --> 33:31.760
Thank you, Chef.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.695
Yachecia, describe
your dish, please.

33:33.695 --> 33:35.564
Yachecia:
<i>A coconut lime tart</i>

33:35.564 --> 33:38.700
<i>with a chocolate</i>
<i>coconut cookie base,</i>

33:38.700 --> 33:40.235
<i>coconut baked meringues</i>

33:40.235 --> 33:45.007
<i>and a raspberry</i>
<i>and coconut rum sauce.</i>

33:45.007 --> 33:47.843
I love the custard,
I love the cookie.

33:47.843 --> 33:49.378
<i>It's beautiful.</i>
<i>It looks professional.</i>

33:49.378 --> 33:51.280
I like the freshness
of the raspberry.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.682
<i>I'm kind of on the fence</i>
<i>about baked meringues.</i>

33:53.682 --> 33:55.918
They just don't
really make a big
impact on your dish.

33:55.918 --> 33:59.121
People say that you're
someone to fear when it
comes to savory and sweet,

33:59.121 --> 34:00.255
and you've proved
them right again.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.356
Thank you, Chef.

34:01.356 --> 34:03.625
Caitlin.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.994
<i>Cate gave you savory.</i>
<i>Describe the dish, please.</i>

34:05.994 --> 34:09.298
Caitlin:
<i>Sweet and spicy pork butt</i>
<i>over coconut rice pilaf,</i>

34:09.298 --> 34:11.500
<i>mashed sweet potatoes</i>
<i>with coconut cream,</i>

34:11.500 --> 34:14.970
and broccolini tossed
with toasted coconut
and sesame seeds.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.205
That's the bit
I'm worried about.

34:16.205 --> 34:17.906
Because you took it out
of the pressure cooker,

34:17.906 --> 34:19.374
sliced it whilst
it's piping hot,

34:19.374 --> 34:20.876
it's undercooked.

34:20.876 --> 34:22.845
It tenses up
like a muscle retracting.

34:22.845 --> 34:26.081
Okay.

34:26.081 --> 34:30.085
It is dreadful.
It's like a mouthful
of chewy, sinewy meat.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.820
<i>The coconut rice,</i>
<i>delicious.</i>

34:31.820 --> 34:35.324
The puree tastes good,
but it's the worst dish
you've cooked.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.894
‐ <i>That's it.</i>
<i>Nothing else to say.</i>
‐ Thank you, Chef.

34:38.894 --> 34:40.329
Chin up, girl.

34:44.933 --> 34:46.535
Next up, Reba, please.
Thank you.

34:46.535 --> 34:48.203
Come on, Rebs!

34:48.203 --> 34:50.772
At first, I wanted
the sweet basket

34:50.772 --> 34:52.274
because I know I can
do something

34:52.274 --> 34:54.176
with the coconut flavoring
for sweets.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.245
<i>But I want to prove myself</i>
<i>with savory.</i>

34:56.245 --> 34:59.014
<i>I struggled a little, but when</i>
<i>I look at my finished dish,</i>

34:59.014 --> 35:01.016
<i>I'm proud of what I've done.</i>
<i>It looks pretty to me.</i>

35:01.016 --> 35:02.618
<i>‐ Reba.</i>
<i>‐ Hello.</i>

35:02.618 --> 35:03.852
Describe the dish, please.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.355
Reba:
<i>It is a coconut</i>
<i>battered shrimp</i>

35:06.355 --> 35:09.691
<i>with coconut flavored</i>
<i>asparagus and a coconut sauce.</i>

35:09.691 --> 35:12.494
I'm gonna have to be honest.

35:12.494 --> 35:14.496
It looks dreadful.

35:14.496 --> 35:19.201
It looks like something
from a Waikiki beach
buffet back in 1984.

35:23.839 --> 35:25.807
The shrimp,
slightly overcooked,

35:25.807 --> 35:27.476
<i>rubbery,</i>
<i>and a little bit chewy.</i>

35:27.476 --> 35:29.211
And, unfortunately,
the breading is all
falling off.

35:29.211 --> 35:32.247
The asparagus tastes good.
And what is this?

35:32.247 --> 35:37.085
It's got parsley and basil
and coconut milk and balsamic.

35:37.085 --> 35:40.222
Ugh.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.390
It's sweet as anything.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.258
It's coconut.

35:43.258 --> 35:45.227
You need something
really acidic,

35:45.227 --> 35:47.763
something citrusy,
not sweet and sickly.

35:47.763 --> 35:49.598
<i>And so it doesn't work.</i>

35:49.598 --> 35:51.667
I'm lost for words, Reba.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.604
‐ Nice job, Reba.
‐ Nice job, Reba.

35:55.604 --> 35:58.407
Guess who's going home?

36:00.609 --> 36:02.177
Next up, please, Daniel.

36:02.177 --> 36:04.813
Cate:
<i>Come on, Daniel.</i>

36:04.813 --> 36:07.549
I haven't really had my chance
to shine yet in the competition.

36:07.549 --> 36:09.885
So, you know, I'm really
hoping that this is it.

36:09.885 --> 36:11.453
<i>I feel really good</i>
<i>about my dish.</i>

36:11.453 --> 36:13.221
<i>I know it's one</i>
<i>of the best dishes I've made</i>

36:13.221 --> 36:14.389
<i>since I got here.</i>

36:14.389 --> 36:16.358
I'm just hoping
that the judges think

36:16.358 --> 36:18.627
that my plate
is as good as I do.

36:18.627 --> 36:21.730
All right, Daniel,
now, Cate chose

36:21.730 --> 36:24.166
that savory coconut basket
for you to cook with tonight.

36:24.166 --> 36:25.400
Yes.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.802
Talk me through this dish.

36:26.802 --> 36:29.638
Daniel:
<i>I have a coconut broth</i>
<i>seafood soup</i>

36:29.638 --> 36:31.740
<i>with crab, lobster,</i>
<i>and snapper.</i>

36:31.740 --> 36:33.542
<i>Got some fresh vegetables</i>
<i>in there.</i>

36:33.542 --> 36:35.811
I added some
carrots and corn.

36:35.811 --> 36:38.313
‐ That lobster and corn's kind
of very New England for me.
‐ Christina: <i>Yeah.</i>

36:38.313 --> 36:41.016
<i>The rice is cooked</i>
<i>completely in coconut water</i>

36:41.016 --> 36:42.317
with some shredded
coconut inside,

36:42.317 --> 36:44.252
and a little bit
of the shredded crab meat.

36:44.252 --> 36:46.421
All right,
let's do this.

36:54.663 --> 36:56.398
Are you kidding me?

37:02.771 --> 37:05.007
All right, Daniel.
Let's do this.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.616
Are you kidding me?

37:14.616 --> 37:18.453
That broth
is out of control.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.288
<i>Those flavors,</i>
<i>that flavor development.</i>

37:20.288 --> 37:22.057
Stay right there.

37:22.057 --> 37:24.393
<i>Lobster tail is cooked</i>
<i>beautifully.</i>

37:24.393 --> 37:28.130
The rice, you nailed it.
Dude, what has taken
you so long?

37:28.130 --> 37:29.197
I don't know,
I don't know.

37:29.197 --> 37:31.199
I'm impressed.
Nice job.

37:31.199 --> 37:33.802
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ Nice work, Daniel.

37:33.802 --> 37:36.171
‐ Danny, baby!
‐ Good job.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.640
‐ I needed that.
‐ Swag!

37:38.640 --> 37:41.476
Cate, can you please
come down?

37:41.476 --> 37:43.645
Cate:
<i>This is a competition,</i>
<i>and so I just wanted</i>

37:43.645 --> 37:47.049
to send one my biggest threats
home today.

37:47.049 --> 37:48.884
<i>That was my plan,</i>
<i>and I think</i>

37:48.884 --> 37:53.522
one of my toughest competitors
has one foot out the door now.

37:53.522 --> 37:58.160
There were two
standout dishes tonight.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.196
‐ Congratulations, Daniel...
‐ Thank you.

38:01.196 --> 38:05.100
<i>...and Dino.</i>

38:05.100 --> 38:07.102
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

38:07.102 --> 38:09.104
Now onto the bad news.

38:09.104 --> 38:11.106
<i>This is an elimination</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

38:11.106 --> 38:15.711
We do have to say good‐bye
to at least one home cook
tonight.

38:15.711 --> 38:19.514
Please make your way
down to the front, Caitlin...

38:21.783 --> 38:25.454
Jeff...

38:25.454 --> 38:28.657
Reba...

38:28.657 --> 38:30.459
Newton.

38:32.127 --> 38:36.298
Caitlin, Jeff,
Reba, Newton,

38:36.298 --> 38:38.633
make no mistake.

38:38.633 --> 38:42.571
Every single one of you
performed poorly tonight.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.510
<i>Caitlin, Newton,</i>

38:48.510 --> 38:51.179
get back to your stations
and get back in line.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.420
Jeff and Reba,

38:58.420 --> 39:03.024
<i>just one of you will</i>
<i>squeeze into the top 12.</i>

39:03.024 --> 39:05.293
Jeff, you light up
this kitchen

39:05.293 --> 39:06.995
and your enthusiasm
is incredible.

39:06.995 --> 39:10.966
Tonight, the science
of your dessert
got the better of you.

39:10.966 --> 39:13.969
<i>Reba, you're the mother</i>
<i>of this kitchen</i>

39:13.969 --> 39:16.271
and you've worked so hard
for everything you've got,

39:16.271 --> 39:18.774
but coconut shrimp,
the technical aspect
got the better of you.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.842
<i>It was almost</i>
<i>like you were lost.</i>

39:23.111 --> 39:25.947
The home cook
leaving tonight...

39:27.616 --> 39:29.317
<i>is...</i>

39:32.387 --> 39:34.122
Reba.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.358
<i>Reba, my darling,</i>
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

39:36.358 --> 39:39.294
Jeff, back to your station,
quickly.

39:41.329 --> 39:44.065
Thank you for being you.

39:44.065 --> 39:46.301
Reba, I'm sorry
to see you leave.

39:46.301 --> 39:50.172
There is so much respect
for you in this room.

39:50.172 --> 39:53.508
<i>You started work at 15.</i>

39:53.508 --> 39:55.577
15, that's unheard of.

39:55.577 --> 39:59.414
And I think you gave
everybody standing
behind you an education,

39:59.414 --> 40:02.083
and that is
the work ethic.

40:02.083 --> 40:03.685
<i>If you want</i>
<i>something in life,</i>

40:03.685 --> 40:05.987
<i>get off your ass</i>
<i>and work for it.</i>

40:05.987 --> 40:07.656
We're gonna miss you.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.658
I'm gonna miss you guys.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.527
And I could've never
gotten anything better

40:12.527 --> 40:14.496
<i>than to cook</i>
<i>in front of you three</i>

40:14.496 --> 40:17.332
and to meet all these
wonderful people.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.835
It's been an honor.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.204
Come up here
and say good‐bye,
my darling.

40:23.238 --> 40:24.439
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Take care.

40:24.439 --> 40:28.009
Thank you.
God bless you.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.845
( sniffles )

40:29.845 --> 40:31.680
All right, you got anything
to say to your new family?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.949
I love every one of y'all.

40:33.949 --> 40:36.518
Don't ever forget
who you are.

40:36.518 --> 40:39.187
Keep your dreams alive.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.256
Anything is possible.

40:41.256 --> 40:43.225
I'm gonna miss you, Reba.

40:43.225 --> 40:45.861
Gordon:
Take care, my darling.

40:45.861 --> 40:48.697
I'm proud of myself
and I know my family'll
be proud of me.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.099
‐ I'm so sorry!
‐ ( mumbles )

40:51.099 --> 40:52.734
Reba:
<i>I've accomplished a lot.</i>

40:52.734 --> 40:56.605
I've got to meet
three of the most amazing
chefs in the world.

40:56.605 --> 40:58.707
I've got to meet
some amazing people.

40:58.707 --> 41:00.375
I'll miss you.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.543
I got to learn
some new dishes

41:01.543 --> 41:03.678
that I would've
never thought or dreamed of.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.313
I love every one of y'all.

41:05.313 --> 41:06.815
Reba:
<i>It's just too soon to go,</i>

41:06.815 --> 41:08.583
but I'm going home
to the best thing in the world

41:08.583 --> 41:10.252
and that's my family.

41:10.252 --> 41:13.922

41:21.730 --> 41:26.268

41:26.268 --> 41:29.004
Announcer:
<i>...it's a high stakes</i>
<i>team challenge.</i>

41:29.004 --> 41:31.406

41:31.406 --> 41:33.174
Announcer:
<i>But when the home cooks</i>
<i>roll the dice...</i>

41:33.174 --> 41:35.010
‐ Ooh!
‐ I'm so ( bleep ) nervous.

41:35.010 --> 41:36.578
Announcer:
<i>Whose gamble will pay off</i>

41:36.578 --> 41:37.913
<i>and who will lose it all...</i>

41:37.913 --> 41:39.681

41:39.681 --> 41:41.416
