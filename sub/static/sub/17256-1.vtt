02:37.198 --> 02:42.579
Last summer, I worked there.
I got pink rot all over my arms.

02:42.787 --> 02:47.208
No way Uncle Joe is going to
talk me into cutting celery again.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.213
If one has committed
the unpardonable sin,

02:52.422 --> 02:54.466
he must realise that he has.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.553
The opposite, Willem.
That is the error of the Pelagians.

02:58.762 --> 03:02.349
The unpardonable sin
is the rejection of the Holy Spirit.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.602
Talk theology, John.
I go back to the Bible.

03:05.810 --> 03:11.524
Just look at Hebrews 10:28 and 29,
or Romans 3:23 to 25.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.500
I'm sick
of watching this television stuff.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.672
- Oh, come on.
- What are you doing?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.675
You know who makes it?
Kids who couldn't get along here.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.135
They go to California
to make television.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.472
I didn't like them here
and I don't like them out there.

03:42.681 --> 03:46.476
Television. If you don't buy one, the
kids go someplace else and watch.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.604
Give the kids a break. It's Christmas.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.194
He hasn't changed in years.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.905
He never will.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.616
Aunt Ruth?

04:03.493 --> 04:06.871
Can we use Timmy for the Nativity
play? We need a baby Jesus.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.915
Timmy is only six months old.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.126
Stand still.

04:12.836 --> 04:17.382
Your dad and I aren't sure you and
Kristen should go on the convention.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.378
But I was a good turkey this year.

04:56.755 --> 05:02.135
Please, don't eat me.
Don't eat me.

05:02.344 --> 05:06.973
Uncle Casey and Aunt Sue are here.
Let's eat.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.517
Now we'll say grace.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.067
Heavenly Father,

05:17.275 --> 05:21.571
we thank thee for bringing this family
together here on this occasion.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.866
Thou knowest our every need.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.619
We ask thee
to watch over us in the coming year.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.499
Keep us safe from harm and danger,
if it be thy will.

05:32.707 --> 05:37.379
Bless all our missionaries throughout
the length and breadth of this earth.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.006
Amen.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.220
Harold Jay, please don't touch that.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.016
Sister, would you see
if Kristen has everything packed?

05:50.225 --> 05:52.102
Of course.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.938
Want to go for coffee
after we send the girls off?

05:55.146 --> 05:59.150
No, thanks anyway.
I've got to get right over to the office.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.321
Anne wants to make sure
you come by for dinner Sunday.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.908
With Kristen gone, you'll be all alone.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.759
You ready?

06:25.093 --> 06:28.013
Don't forget your gloves.

06:38.356 --> 06:42.569
- Alvin.
- OK. Bye.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.121
I wish I was going to Disneyland.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.042
Daverman.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.544
DeBeer.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.131
Deboer. DeJong.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.009
- Have a nice time.
- De Vries.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.220
Get a shot of her, will you? Wave.

07:10.472 --> 07:14.434
Come on, Marsha, get going there.
De Vries.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.523
Vanderkeen.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.776
Vanderlon.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.695
VanDorn.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.948
- Take care of yourself. I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.909
If you need anything, just call.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.215
There they go.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.221
Safely away.

08:14.202 --> 08:18.039
A new shipment came in? Good.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.969
This look all right to you?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.054
- Those the right specs?
- I think so.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.683
- That's fine.
- OK. Thank you.

09:26.816 --> 09:31.363
- This all the space you could get?
- I tried to get more but this is the limit.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.408
The De Vries line has the same area.

09:36.743 --> 09:41.331
- What do you think of that blue?
- I like it, Mr VanDorn.

09:41.539 --> 09:46.544
- Don't think it's a little bright?
- Not really. You want to tone it down?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.046
No.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.633
I wouldn't hire a display designer
if I didn't trust her taste.

09:51.841 --> 09:57.389
Maybe we could bring more of
that shade in. Perhaps a panel?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.141
No, that would be
much too overpowering.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.603
Overpowering. That's the word
I was looking for.

10:05.605 --> 10:10.402
Mr VanDorn, I've worked
on this colour scheme for weeks.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.114
I think it's just right.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.826
- What do you call that shade?
- Pavonine.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.747
It's the same shade as the fabric.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.130
Still going with that fellow
that teaches at Grand Valley?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.132
- Sam?
- Yeah.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.176
Nice guy. You don't want to lose him.

10:35.385 --> 10:40.140
Maybe we could take it down
a little bit. It's just a little-

10:40.348 --> 10:43.268
- Overpowering?
- Yeah.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.605
OK, I think we could
knock that pavonine blue a bit.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.277
- Are you sure it's all right?
- Yes. I think it'll look better.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.030
If you say so.

11:39.657 --> 11:43.703
This is so boring.
I can't wait till tomorrow.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.705
You going to the farm with him?

11:45.914 --> 11:48.291
He asked me.
Are you going with anybody?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.460
I don't know.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.630
- Do you know how to play chicken?
- What's that?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.882
You don't know how to play?

11:56.091 --> 11:59.803
Well, you see, a boy goes like this.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.100
What does it do?

12:05.308 --> 12:09.854
Each time he comes in closer,
and closer, and closer,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.399
until you say chicken
and then he stops.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.235
Does Jerry do that?

12:17.362 --> 12:20.824
Everybody,
time for your discussion group.

12:21.616 --> 12:26.162
Marsha, put your nametag back on.
Come on.

12:28.123 --> 12:32.335
Question. What is your only comfort
in life and death?

12:32.544 --> 12:39.759
Answer. That I, body and soul, both
in life and death, am not my own,

12:39.968 --> 12:43.555
but belong unto
my faithful saviour, Jesus Christ.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.906
Soon as the service begins,
the ushers go to Big Boy's for coffee.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.991
I'll get it.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.496
So when someone like old
Mrs Van Dyke in a wheelchair needs help,

13:49.704 --> 13:51.790
there's no one there to help her.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.417
You never find those guys
when you need them.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.712
Aren't you glad
you came for Sunday dinner now?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.215
- It's for you, Jake.
- Thank you.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.301
I hope I never get old
and have to be in a wheelchair

14:03.510 --> 14:06.680
and have to depend on the ushers
to help me out of church.

14:06.888 --> 14:10.850
You'd never let that happen to your
mother, would you, Harold Jay?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.812
When?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.565
Yes, all right. Thank you.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.165
What is it, Jake?

14:34.374 --> 14:39.921
That was Mrs Steensma,
calling from California.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.174
Kristen's disappeared.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.928
- What happened?
- They don't know.

14:47.137 --> 14:52.892
They were on some sort of recreation
deal at Knott's Berry farm.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.771
They came back to the bus. Kristen
was gone. They couldn't find her.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.608
- They called the police?
- Yeah.

15:00.817 --> 15:05.405
- Is Marsha there?
- Yeah, she's all right. She's upset.

15:05.613 --> 15:10.368
I've got to fly out there today.
They want me to bring some pictures.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.956
I'll go with you.
I'll check the airline schedules.

15:15.165 --> 15:19.377
Just let me pack some things.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.524
There's a ride called
the Great White Knuckler.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.819
The last time I saw Kristen,
she was standing there.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.739
Why was she alone?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.783
Was she alone?

15:49.991 --> 15:55.622
- I told the policeman.
- They had met an older boy earlier.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.584
Well, it turns out that
the boy your daughter was talking to

15:59.793 --> 16:02.587
didn't work at the park.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.259
- We've interviewed everybody there.
- But if she has-

16:08.468 --> 16:11.554
At the present,
there's no indication of any violence.

16:11.763 --> 16:16.476
- Let's hope she's just a runaway.
- There's something very wrong here.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.020
Kristen isn't the type of person
to leave.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.856
I said, let's hope she's a runaway.

16:22.065 --> 16:26.277
If she's a runaway, she knows where
she is. That's better than a lot of kids.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.489
Some won't show up for years,
some won't show up at all.

16:29.698 --> 16:33.159
- These are the realities.
- What are you doing?

16:33.368 --> 16:37.372
I've got two officers on the case.
They're gonna follow up every lead.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.458
- We'll give it our best shot.
- What can we do?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.545
There are people
who specialise in this kind of thing.

16:43.753 --> 16:47.882
I suppose you could hire yourselves
the best private detective in town.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.719
He might be able to put
all his energies into it.

16:52.012 --> 16:58.226
Mr Mast, I'm Jake VanDorn.
This is my brother-in-law, Wesley.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.108
- Coffee?
- Black.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.915
Let me ask you a personal question.

17:21.124 --> 17:25.462
Was your daughter
the kind of girl to run around?

17:25.670 --> 17:29.966
Play practical jokes, maybe?

17:31.593 --> 17:34.554
No, I didn't think she was.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.768
Let me get the picture here,
let me guess.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.188
Let me visualise your daughter.

17:43.396 --> 17:48.193
She's an absolutely clean girl,
a model daughter.

17:48.943 --> 17:53.615
She never had a rebellious or impure
thought. She didn't fuck around.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.117
If I were you, I'd watch my language.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.495
I'm a private detective, VanDorn.

17:58.703 --> 18:03.124
You want to hire a choir boy,
you can go back to Grand Rapids.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.670
I've been to that scumbag town.
It's full of them.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.547
- Who's paying you?
- You are.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.384
That's right.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.596
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend your personal beliefs.

18:16.805 --> 18:21.601
Believe me, I'm a practitioner
of Mind Science myself.

18:22.602 --> 18:28.650
Look, I'm good at this. I do it a lot.
Don't worry, I'll find her. No problem.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.445
It may take a week or two,
maybe a month, at most.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.448
I get $750 a week, minimum.

18:36.825 --> 18:40.870
It may seem like a lot to you,
but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.

18:41.079 --> 18:44.541
- And better?
- I suppose.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.752
But I got an instinct.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.755
If your daughter's here,
I'll track her down.

18:50.964 --> 18:56.177
There's not much you can do here.
Maybe it'd be better if you go home.

18:56.386 --> 19:00.765
You could look through
Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.518
Maybe find out
if she knew somebody out here.

19:03.727 --> 19:09.357
A friend, a relative. Maybe somebody
she knew knew somebody out here.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.411
Jake.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.747
Where's Marsha?

20:05.955 --> 20:09.292
- How about some cake and coffee?
- Just coffee.

20:09.501 --> 20:12.879
- Hello, Uncle Jake.
- Sorry I didn't make it yesterday.

20:13.088 --> 20:16.007
Here's your present, a day late.
I hope you like it.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.219
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.847
- What is it?
- You'll see.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.685
- I'll just go out on the porch.
- OK, Jake.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.771
What is it, honey?

21:00.093 --> 21:04.848
- Here. Sit here.
- No, thanks. I'll sit over there.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.440
Spring's gonna be early.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.359
A cold spring means a hot summer.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.319
It's gonna be a good year.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.910
How's your business, Jake?

21:26.119 --> 21:29.164
Not too bad.

21:29.372 --> 21:33.668
You know, you should
come around more often.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.588
We haven't seen you for weeks.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.759
Anne complains
she doesn't see you at all any more.

21:47.182 --> 21:51.353
You can't dwell on Kristen all the time.

21:53.188 --> 21:57.650
Sometimes it's hard for us
to understand the Lord's ways.

21:58.651 --> 22:03.782
He's testing you.
You have to have faith.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.951
Would you?

22:10.372 --> 22:12.791
Could you?

22:26.221 --> 22:28.431
- Hello.
- Mr VanDorn.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.975
- Mast?
- Yeah.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.353
Where are you?
The connection's good.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.648
- I'm back in Grand Rapids.
- GR? Why?

22:36.856 --> 22:39.984
Can you meet me in about an hour?
At the Pantlind Hotel.

22:40.193 --> 22:44.614
- I have a meeting.
- What are you paying me for?

22:44.823 --> 22:47.492
I'll be there.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.870
Have you ever seen
any pornographic movies?

22:51.079 --> 22:54.499
- No.
- Know what a hardcore movie is?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.627
- Yes, it's like a stag film, huh?
- Yeah.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.213
- Have you ever seen one of those?
- No.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.550
- They're legal now, all over.
- So I gather.

23:03.758 --> 23:07.345
Even here in Grand Rapids.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.268
There's a little stall theatre up here.
It's closed now.

23:13.476 --> 23:20.275
But I got the use of it for an hour.
There's something you ought to see.

25:02.335 --> 25:05.130
It can't be.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.049
Oh, my God.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.390
Turn it off.

25:33.074 --> 25:36.286
Turn it off, please.

26:16.201 --> 26:18.453
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

26:18.662 --> 26:22.374
- Where'd you get that film?
- A store in LA. I gotta keep it.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.042
- Who made it?
- I don't know.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.920
- What do you mean?
- Wait a minute. Slow down.

26:27.128 --> 26:30.924
A film like this, 8mm film,
it costs $200 or $300 to make.

26:31.132 --> 26:34.427
Sold outright in a store.
Shown in peep machines.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.346
It's impossible to track down.

26:36.554 --> 26:42.060
Nobody makes it. Nobody shows it.
Nobody sees it.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.355
It's like it doesn't even exist.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.734
What's it called?

26:49.943 --> 26:51.861
Slave of Love when I bought it.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.280
Next time it's sold, something else.

26:54.489 --> 26:56.658
- But the police.
- The police?

26:56.866 --> 27:00.453
You know more than the police do.

27:00.662 --> 27:05.250
- You think she's all right?
- Yeah, probably.

27:07.502 --> 27:10.213
You like this, don't you?
Showing me this.

27:10.422 --> 27:13.466
I hate it. But you got to know, buddy,

27:13.675 --> 27:15.969
there's a lot of strange things
happening.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.846
Things you don't know about.

27:18.054 --> 27:21.850
Things you don't want to know about.
Doors that shouldn't be opened.

27:22.058 --> 27:26.438
I'll find her.
But I can't make any promises.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.233
I don't know what she'll be like.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.611
And when I find her,
you may not even want her back.

28:19.616 --> 28:23.411
Actors, to your positions, please.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.539
Come on, Niki, put your wig back on.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.168
- Let's get it on.
- Yeah, get it together, kids.

28:30.377 --> 28:33.963
Can't you get this bed any warmer?
My ass is freezing.

28:34.172 --> 28:36.716
- He's got it up.
- It's about time.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.052
- He's got a big schlong.
- Great talent.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.597
- Action. Move it, let's go.
- The wallpaper, it's peeling.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.475
- Never mind. Keep shooting.
- We're rolling.

28:45.684 --> 28:47.519
Come on. Keep it going.

28:47.727 --> 28:52.273
All right. Niki, throw your legs
around his shoulders.

28:52.482 --> 28:57.028
Bennie, swing around this way
and lick her belly.

28:57.237 --> 29:00.281
Maybe we should use a strobe light.

29:00.490 --> 29:03.410
So it looks like
they're doing more than they are.

29:03.618 --> 29:06.287
For what we're paying,
they'll do what we want.

29:06.496 --> 29:08.665
Quick, get some spun glass.

29:08.873 --> 29:14.921
Niki, come on, sweetheart. You're
lying back. You're feeling real good.

29:15.130 --> 29:21.720
Setting your mind free, thinking about
your dad. Your mind is open.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.472
- The kid's a good director.
- UCLA.

29:32.939 --> 29:38.069
Bennie, come on, now. Niki, move
a bit more to your right. That's good.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.533
To your left.

29:45.118 --> 29:48.621
They can go all night.

29:50.540 --> 29:53.960
Hey, what do you know,
what do you hear, what do you say?

29:54.169 --> 29:57.589
Don't get uppity. I remember
when you was running a car wash.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.883
You couldn't make a go of that.

30:00.091 --> 30:03.928
What was the other thing? A Dairy
Queen? That went bust too, didn't it?

30:04.137 --> 30:07.098
Always in action though,
always made a dollar. Right?

30:07.307 --> 30:09.184
Right. Always in action.

30:09.392 --> 30:12.479
This girl,
she's been doing some porn stuff.

30:12.687 --> 30:15.273
- Do you recognise her?
- No.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.777
Look again, this is jailbait.
It could get you in trouble.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.987
That's no twice.

30:21.196 --> 30:24.366
All right.
I may have to go to the authorities.

30:24.574 --> 30:26.576
You want to listen to me, Andy?

30:26.785 --> 30:29.913
You play with yourself?
You must play with yourself.

30:30.121 --> 30:33.958
Am I gonna bother with that?
Look at my girls. They're beautiful.

30:34.167 --> 30:37.962
I'm a father to these girls.
Do I have to bother with that shit?

30:38.171 --> 30:41.675
You know who's in there now?
Terry. The beauty.

30:41.883 --> 30:44.177
- Right. The fire dancer.
- Very hot.

30:44.386 --> 30:47.180
She'll grow hair on your head.

30:47.389 --> 30:51.142
Do you want to hang around?
But you gotta be quiet.

30:51.351 --> 30:54.396
- Don't make a sound.
- That's really Terry?

30:58.316 --> 31:01.986
Back up a little bit
and wrap yourself around him.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.284
OK, cut.

31:21.589 --> 31:24.426
I'm going out of town for a while.

31:24.634 --> 31:27.470
No, I don't know when I'll be back.

31:27.679 --> 31:32.017
No, there's nothing wrong.
Think you can keep things running?

31:33.018 --> 31:34.477
Don't ask.

32:39.334 --> 32:40.835
- There's a vibe.
- Definitely.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.505
- It's really there.
- There's a real vibe.

32:43.713 --> 32:46.174
Feels like I could share
things with you.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.802
- And I try to be giving.
- I like your carpet.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.762
I did it myself, you know.

32:55.225 --> 32:58.103
Shit, it's the cops.

32:58.311 --> 33:02.732
- Who the fuck is that?
- What are you doing? Son of a bitch.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.694
I've been paying you every week
for four months-

33:05.902 --> 33:09.322
- I'm splitting.
- I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim.

33:09.531 --> 33:13.660
This is research, damn it. That girl
could have told us something.

33:13.868 --> 33:18.039
Research? I suppose these are the
extra expenses I've been paying you.

33:18.248 --> 33:21.001
Why don't you stay where
you belong, in yo-yo land?

33:21.209 --> 33:22.836
Get out of here.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.798
I'm only human, you know.
I'm not perfect.

33:27.007 --> 33:31.094
- Get out.
- This is my own apartment.

33:32.595 --> 33:37.809
- Get out.
- All right, you rat prick.

33:38.393 --> 33:42.147
Go find your own daughter.

33:42.355 --> 33:46.234
I'm not smart enough
to lock my own fucking door.

37:00.178 --> 37:02.722
50-cent admission.

37:03.848 --> 37:08.978
It's a 50-cents admission.
It's applicable to a purchase.

38:14.085 --> 38:18.173
Have you got a film
called Slave of Love?

38:18.381 --> 38:22.093
- What we got is what you see.
- It's a short film.

38:22.302 --> 38:25.138
They're all about the same.
Would you like something?

38:25.347 --> 38:29.267
- This is the movie I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about?

38:29.476 --> 38:33.188
I wondered if you'd ever seen this film
of this woman right here.

38:33.396 --> 38:37.233
That girl? No, I never seen her.
I don't know anybody.

38:37.442 --> 38:40.028
I'm trying to find...

38:40.236 --> 38:43.448
- Who owns this store?
- I don't know.

38:43.657 --> 38:47.494
If you're looking for somebody,
you ought to check the yellow pages.

38:47.702 --> 38:51.831
- Wait a minute.
- I don't know nothing, man.

38:58.672 --> 39:01.466
You don't want anything
for your 50 cents?

39:02.300 --> 39:04.469
- Take your 50 cents.
- That's all right.

39:04.678 --> 39:08.556
No, take it.
I don't want your goddamn 50 cents.

39:45.093 --> 39:49.639
Companionship? Want some
friendship? Free information.

39:49.848 --> 39:54.019
Right in here, sir.
They'll treat you well.

40:01.568 --> 40:05.947
Hello. Welcome to Wild Mary's.
I'm Beatrice.

40:06.156 --> 40:08.450
- Have you been here before?
- No.

40:08.658 --> 40:13.788
What we offer is nude body-to-body
contact on a bed in a private room.

40:13.997 --> 40:17.375
It's $20 a half-hour, $30 an hour.

40:18.126 --> 40:22.380
Anything else you may desire may be
discussed in the privacy of your room.

40:22.589 --> 40:24.007
Tipping's allowed.

40:24.215 --> 40:29.471
We accept BankAmericard,
MasterCharge, American Express.

40:29.679 --> 40:34.392
I don't think I want
body-to-body contact.

40:34.601 --> 40:38.938
You can discuss that in your private
room with the lady of your choice.

40:39.147 --> 40:42.984
- Hi.
- I'm looking for a girl.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.153
Have you ever been in a porno film?

40:45.362 --> 40:49.115
Why don't you come back with me?
I'm sure you'll find what you like.

40:54.079 --> 40:56.373
- You want a session?
- No, I don't think so.

40:56.581 --> 41:00.043
You sure? We have regular sessions,
too. It's only $20.

41:28.279 --> 41:31.116
Want to see what we got?

41:54.305 --> 41:57.225
See you later, Felice.

41:59.436 --> 42:01.646
- You ever been here before?
- No.

42:01.855 --> 42:03.606
We offer female wrestling.

42:03.815 --> 42:07.986
Nude body-to-body contact with the
girl of your choice in a private room.

42:08.194 --> 42:10.530
$20 a half-hour, $30 an hour.

42:10.739 --> 42:13.491
Other arrangements can be
discussed in your room.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.452
Tips are permitted.

42:15.660 --> 42:19.956
We accept BankAmericard,
MasterCharge, American Express.

42:21.291 --> 42:23.376
Do you want to take a session?

42:23.585 --> 42:25.712
I just wanted to ask some questions.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.548
Yeah, you can do that
in the privacy of your room.

42:28.757 --> 42:31.009
OK, I'll take a half-hour.

42:31.217 --> 42:34.763
- Any particular choice of girl?
- You'll do fine.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.644
Just follow me.

42:53.782 --> 42:57.535
Why don't you just wait in here?
I gotta get a sheet.

43:07.837 --> 43:12.133
- You're still dressed?
- Yeah, I want to...

43:12.342 --> 43:14.594
Why don't you just relax?

43:14.803 --> 43:18.181
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a seat.

43:18.390 --> 43:21.351
My name's Felice.

43:21.559 --> 43:25.563
There's this girl
that I wanted to ask you about.

43:25.772 --> 43:28.817
You're not a Vice?
Do you work for Los Angeles PD

43:29.025 --> 43:31.820
or have any affiliation
with law enforcement agencies?

43:32.028 --> 43:33.363
No, I don't.

43:33.571 --> 43:38.284
I have to ask you that.
If you were Vice, you couldn't deny it.

43:38.493 --> 43:43.456
You shouldn't dress so straight.
You wouldn't get hassled so much.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.583
Let me help you get this tie off.

43:45.792 --> 43:50.714
I want to talk to you about this girl.
I have her picture right here.

43:50.922 --> 43:54.342
- Pull out your cock.
- What?

43:54.551 --> 44:00.724
Cops aren't allowed to do that, either.
A judge ruled that was entrapment.

44:01.683 --> 44:04.060
No, I'm not a cop. As a matter of fact,

44:04.269 --> 44:07.313
I have less respect for the police
than you do.

44:07.522 --> 44:12.819
I'm trying to find this girl, a runaway.
I can't get anybody to help me.

44:13.028 --> 44:16.364
- Are you going to stiff me?
- What do you mean?

44:16.573 --> 44:22.370
Look, that 20 bucks you just paid to
get in here? I don't get any of that.

44:22.579 --> 44:25.415
That goes to the guys
that own this place.

44:25.623 --> 44:30.503
I get two bucks an hour, plus ten
per cent of that goes to a bail fund.

44:30.712 --> 44:33.548
- I make all my money on tips.
- You want a tip?

44:33.757 --> 44:36.801
Sure I want a tip. What do you want?

44:37.010 --> 44:39.763
Tips can be what?
Anywhere from, like, $30 to $70.

44:39.971 --> 44:43.725
- What do you mean?
- What do you want to tip me for?

44:43.933 --> 44:48.271
Got to spell it out, man. Just tell me
what you want. Just relax.

44:48.480 --> 44:53.068
Here, I'll give you a tip. Here's $40.

44:57.030 --> 45:00.033
Now, what do you want?

45:00.241 --> 45:03.370
- I want to talk to you.
- Yeah, that's cool.

45:03.578 --> 45:08.249
About this woman. I'm looking for her.
I want to know if you know her.

45:10.085 --> 45:14.422
Man, I told you, I don't know nobody.
I never seen her before.

45:14.631 --> 45:17.008
- I'm getting angry.
- Wait a minute, man.

45:17.217 --> 45:19.094
That's gonna cost more than $40.

45:19.302 --> 45:22.013
- I'm gonna find some answers.
- Wait a minute.

45:22.222 --> 45:23.807
Who runs this place?

45:24.015 --> 45:26.559
Is it that blond guy out there?
Is that who?

45:26.768 --> 45:31.106
I'm gonna talk to somebody. Where's
the bastard that runs this shithole?

45:31.314 --> 45:33.942
- What's the problem?
- He's causing trouble.

45:34.150 --> 45:35.652
Help me find this woman.

45:35.860 --> 45:39.030
I've been asking everybody.
Nobody knows anything.

45:39.239 --> 45:42.867
- We don't want the cops here.
- I suppose you haven't seen her.

45:43.076 --> 45:46.413
Her name is Kristen. I suppose
you've never seen her, right?

45:46.621 --> 45:48.331
Shut up.

45:53.378 --> 45:55.964
That's it, man. Cool it.

45:59.676 --> 46:01.511
Knock it off.

47:39.317 --> 47:41.236
The numbers
on Bang the Nun Slowly?

47:41.444 --> 47:43.530
- No, Proud Pussy.
- Right, read.

47:43.738 --> 47:45.991
- They're very good.
- Just read.

47:46.199 --> 47:49.536
- Houston is $74,000.
- Yeah, go ahead.

47:49.744 --> 47:52.080
Dallas is $160,000.

47:52.288 --> 47:54.332
- Dallas is what?
- $160,000.

47:54.541 --> 47:55.834
That's nice.

47:56.042 --> 47:58.878
Better than the Leeway Brothers.
They only pulled 30.

47:59.087 --> 48:01.172
Who the fuck told you
to mention them?

48:01.381 --> 48:03.425
They made Love Muscle.

48:03.633 --> 48:06.386
With Suzie Stretchmark
in a delivery room.

48:06.594 --> 48:08.513
I make pictures of quality.

48:08.722 --> 48:11.725
I make custard. You understand?
I use custard.

48:11.933 --> 48:14.978
Little chicks off the surfboard.
Take them and dunk them.

48:15.186 --> 48:18.064
You can pull them in and out.
Quality is the answer.

48:18.273 --> 48:21.192
- What'd we do in St. Louis?
- St. Louis, $38,000.

48:21.401 --> 48:24.279
St. Louis can bang this slowly.
Who booked St. Louis?

48:29.326 --> 48:33.872
Hi, I'm Jake De Vries.
I'm here to see Mr Ramada.

48:34.080 --> 48:38.126
- Where's my accountant?
- He's got a bad stomach.

48:38.877 --> 48:42.630
- Hello. What is it, Georgia?
- There's a Mr De Vries here.

48:42.839 --> 48:46.384
A Mr De Vries. I don't know a...
You know a De Vries?

48:46.593 --> 48:49.804
- I never heard of him.
- You ask where he's from.

48:50.013 --> 48:53.850
- Detroit. What'd we do in Detroit?
- Detroit? Big. $200,000.

48:54.059 --> 48:55.560
Send him in, Georgia.

48:55.769 --> 48:58.647
You never can tell. Who knows?
Detroit. $200,000.

48:58.855 --> 49:01.441
- He may own drive-ins.
- Right.

49:01.650 --> 49:04.861
- You feeling OK?
- I told you never to ask me how I feel.

49:05.070 --> 49:06.946
All you do is say " right".

49:07.155 --> 49:10.825
- Right.
- That's all you're supposed to say.

49:11.034 --> 49:16.623
Mr De Vries. Hello, how are you?
I'm Bill Ramada, and this is Kurt.

49:16.831 --> 49:19.042
- Kurt.
- How do you do?

49:19.250 --> 49:22.420
Sit down, Detroit. I love Detroit.

49:22.629 --> 49:25.757
Had an all-time box office smash
there, Little Oral Annie.

49:25.965 --> 49:27.550
I'm afraid I missed that.

49:27.759 --> 49:31.304
You missed a good one.
The girl's gonna be a big star, right?

49:31.513 --> 49:33.223
That's my " right" man.

49:33.431 --> 49:36.768
- What can I do for you, Mr De Vries?
- Call me Jake.

49:36.976 --> 49:38.978
Jake, what can I do for you?

49:39.187 --> 49:42.315
I'm interested in financing
an adult feature film

49:42.524 --> 49:44.901
and I was told
you were the man to see.

49:45.110 --> 49:48.279
You came to the right man.
Continue. Go ahead.

49:48.488 --> 49:53.076
I have $50,000 that I'm prepared
to invest in a suitable project.

49:53.284 --> 49:59.040
Of course, I may want to get involved
in the process of making the film.

49:59.249 --> 50:02.544
Meet people who make
this kind of film, learn how it's done.

50:02.752 --> 50:06.756
- What business are you in?
- I have my own business.

50:06.965 --> 50:09.801
We make rivets for the auto industry.

50:10.010 --> 50:14.556
Rivets? That sounds like a good,
solid American business. Right, Kurt?

50:14.764 --> 50:17.017
Sit down, will you?

50:17.225 --> 50:21.688
Why does a solid businessman like
you want to get into pornography?

50:21.896 --> 50:24.941
Well, Bill...
Is it all right if I call you Bill?

50:25.150 --> 50:27.193
Yeah, you can call me Bill. Go ahead.

50:27.402 --> 50:30.405
I'll be frank with you, Bill.
I've made a lot of money.

50:30.613 --> 50:33.742
Well, even rivets can get
a little boring after a while.

50:33.950 --> 50:37.120
My business manager
suggested I tax-shelter some income.

50:37.329 --> 50:38.997
I thought I'd give this a try.

50:39.205 --> 50:43.376
- What, the rivet hit you in the eye?
- Detroit's a tough town.

50:43.585 --> 50:48.673
It's cool, you don't have to bullshit me.
You're looking to lay some pipe.

50:49.966 --> 50:55.555
- Get fucked? Humped? Banged?
- Not exactly.

50:56.306 --> 50:58.975
You know,
$50,000 buys you a lot of pussy.

50:59.184 --> 51:01.644
You can get yourself pussy-whipped
for that.

51:01.853 --> 51:04.314
What do you want to fuck
with movies for?

51:04.522 --> 51:07.651
- It's an investment.
- It's an investment?

51:07.859 --> 51:11.321
A couple of years ago,
I would've jumped at 50 big ones.

51:11.529 --> 51:15.617
But listen to this. What did we do
on High-School Honeys last year?

51:15.825 --> 51:20.622
- Five-three.
- That's $5,300,000.

51:20.830 --> 51:24.542
Does that sound like I need a
partner? I don't take partners. Right?

51:24.751 --> 51:28.338
But I'll give you some advice.
You look like a nice guy.

51:28.546 --> 51:31.257
Start small,
start with the kiddie porno.

51:31.466 --> 51:34.135
Then work yourself up.
And come around the set.

51:34.344 --> 51:37.389
I'll see if somebody wants
your 50 and you can get in.

51:37.597 --> 51:40.100
- I appreciate that, Bill.
- You appreciate it?

51:40.308 --> 51:42.268
But right now, I gotta go.

51:42.477 --> 51:46.147
I'm a hypoglycaemic, my sugar runs
low. So I got to eat something.

51:46.356 --> 51:50.568
Listen, don't forget my door is always
open to artistic people.

51:50.777 --> 51:54.531
I want you to get me a hamburger,
lean, and some dry toast.

51:55.865 --> 52:00.161
WIM. 35, 175.

52:00.370 --> 52:03.415
Fastest tongue in West.

52:03.623 --> 52:07.210
Will demonstrate proficiency
in all dialects...

52:08.837 --> 52:11.840
to females under 50.

52:12.048 --> 52:16.594
Looks not imp. I-M-P, that's in caps.

52:17.887 --> 52:23.143
George Harper.
PO Box 77, Alhambra, California.

52:24.060 --> 52:26.563
That's on next week?
I need it out by Thursday.

52:26.771 --> 52:29.274
No problem.

52:29.482 --> 52:31.735
I'd like to place an ad
in the Personals.

52:31.943 --> 52:35.739
- How many weeks will that be for?
- Just one.

52:35.947 --> 52:39.951
" Film producer."
That should be in caps, bold face.

52:40.160 --> 52:44.664
"Seeks young men, 18 to 25,
for hardcore film.

52:44.873 --> 52:50.045
" Prior film experience a must.
Call Jake at the Cinema Motel.

52:50.253 --> 52:52.547
"555-5671."

52:56.426 --> 52:59.137
I like it red.

53:02.849 --> 53:06.895
- How far you girls going?
- Far as you want. We're stranded.

53:07.103 --> 53:09.689
Stranded?
I guess I'm going first class.

53:09.898 --> 53:12.901
- Cut.
- Is that OK?

53:13.109 --> 53:15.654
What kind of army
has a soldier like that?

53:15.862 --> 53:19.824
- He brought his own uniform.
- Let's move in for the close-up.

53:20.033 --> 53:23.036
Come on.

53:28.833 --> 53:31.586
What are you doing,
making a career out of this?

53:31.795 --> 53:35.382
- Too much angel dust-
- Do you think you are Antonioni?

53:35.590 --> 53:37.634
- Mr...
- De Vries.

53:37.842 --> 53:40.345
- De Vries.
- Kurt.

53:45.433 --> 53:48.103
Are you the star of this picture?

53:48.311 --> 53:53.566
Are you kidding? Three days' work.
I finish tonight.

53:53.775 --> 53:57.612
- The other girl's the star?
- She thinks so.

53:57.821 --> 53:59.364
What do you do?

53:59.572 --> 54:03.201
I'm with Ramada,
we're doing some things together.

54:04.536 --> 54:08.498
Next time you talk to him,
tell him to pay his actresses more.

54:08.707 --> 54:12.502
- Paint the grass red-
- For what you pay, I don't paint-

54:12.711 --> 54:15.588
Don't talk that way to me,
you cock-eyed bastard.

54:15.797 --> 54:20.927
Niki, we're ready. Put your wig
back on and take your position.

54:21.136 --> 54:23.680
Nice meeting you.

54:28.601 --> 54:31.396
All right. Come on, get back
in the car. Let's go.

54:31.604 --> 54:34.357
All right. Come on. Action.

54:36.943 --> 54:39.988
How far are you girls going?

54:46.077 --> 54:48.663
Next time, maybe we'll get
to be the soldier.

54:48.872 --> 54:54.169
Boy, us military get special treatment.

54:54.377 --> 54:57.589
This is where
we come in for the close-up.

55:57.816 --> 56:00.944
What's happening here, Jake?

56:08.535 --> 56:11.287
How did you find me?

56:11.496 --> 56:14.624
I called every LA hotel.

56:14.833 --> 56:19.337
Holiday Inn gave this
as a referral number.

56:19.546 --> 56:22.257
Your office said you had
no business in New York.

56:22.465 --> 56:25.719
So I figured you'd come out here.

56:25.927 --> 56:30.974
- Wesley, do me a favour, will you?
- What?

56:43.111 --> 56:47.073
Leave me alone.
Go home. Go away.

56:47.282 --> 56:50.535
- Jake, I can't-
- Do what I say, please.

56:55.498 --> 56:57.250
What is going on, Jake?

57:03.006 --> 57:08.470
I have an idea of how to find Kristen.
I have a plan, but I have to be alone.

57:11.806 --> 57:14.768
What'll I tell the others, then?

57:16.645 --> 57:19.773
We care about you.

57:22.275 --> 57:25.945
Tell them anything you want.
Tell them I'm on vacation.

57:26.613 --> 57:29.699
Tell them I'm on a business trip.

57:30.575 --> 57:33.495
Just don't tell them about this,
that's all.

57:44.255 --> 57:46.883
Go home. Go away.

57:59.396 --> 58:02.065
Yes, it's open, come in.

58:03.024 --> 58:05.902
- Jake? Mr Holcum?
- Pete?

58:06.111 --> 58:08.905
- Peter Long, that's the name I use.
- Right.

58:09.114 --> 58:10.490
Well, Pete.

58:12.283 --> 58:16.705
We're casting male roles
for an explicit sex-action feature.

58:16.913 --> 58:18.748
It pays $100 a day.

58:18.957 --> 58:21.418
Up to two weeks' work.
You've had experience?

58:21.626 --> 58:26.047
I was in the film Sodom and
Gomorrah. I don't know if you saw it.

58:26.256 --> 58:31.011
I played the slave of the Queen of
Gomorrah. I got some pictures here.

58:31.219 --> 58:33.555
Excuse me a second.

58:33.763 --> 58:37.225
Yeah. This is Jake.

58:37.434 --> 58:41.313
We're casting right now. Have you
had hardcore-film experience?

58:43.356 --> 58:48.320
All right, supposing I try
to squeeze you in today between...

58:48.528 --> 58:51.156
4.00, 4.15, is that all right?

58:51.364 --> 58:54.242
Yeah, the Cinema Motel,
Van Nuys, room seven.

58:54.451 --> 58:56.828
Very good, we'll see you then. Bye.

58:57.037 --> 58:59.247
OK, I have your
answering-service number.

58:59.456 --> 59:03.376
If we decide to use you,
I'll give you a call.

59:11.885 --> 59:14.721
I'm Dick Blaque.
You're doing a porno movie, right?

59:14.929 --> 59:18.141
- Right.
- Then I'm the man for you.

59:18.350 --> 59:21.478
Glad to meet you. You're not
the type we're looking for.

59:21.686 --> 59:24.356
You mean because I'm black?

59:24.564 --> 59:27.942
- No, you're just not the type.
- What do you mean, not the type?

59:28.151 --> 59:30.820
Man, don't you know who I am?
I'm Big Dick Blaque.

59:31.029 --> 59:33.198
I've done more movies
than you ever saw.

59:33.406 --> 59:36.618
I've worked with Harry Reems,
Johnny Wadd. Not the type?

59:36.826 --> 59:38.787
I can come 10 times a day.

59:38.995 --> 59:42.332
I can keep it hard for two hours.
I'm a woman's dream.

59:42.540 --> 59:45.794
I got a dick hung on me
nine inches long.

59:46.002 --> 59:48.755
I'm sorry, Mr Blaque,
I'm sure you're very good.

59:48.963 --> 59:52.634
I just don't have anything for you.
If something comes up-

59:52.842 --> 59:56.721
Shit. You don't want to hire
any niggers, that's all.

59:56.930 --> 01:00:00.058
I knew this was a scam.
This is bullshit.

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:09.067
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you're not exactly the type.

01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:13.655
We had something
a little different in mind.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:21.579
- Don't you want to see my stuff, man?
- What stuff?

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.919
You know, my stuff.

01:00:29.796 --> 01:00:31.965
Yeah, sure.

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:43.643
All right, thank you very much.

01:00:53.695 --> 01:00:56.323
Yes, come in.

01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:00.952
Hey, man, what's happening?

01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:04.164
We're casting
an explicit sex-action feature.

01:01:04.372 --> 01:01:07.042
I know. Word's out on the street.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:11.463
Word's also out
that you ain't really hiring anybody.

01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:19.763
- That's not true, Mr...?
- Jim Sloan.

01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:23.266
Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:28.438
That's not true, Jim.
As a matter of fact,

01:01:28.647 --> 01:01:31.399
I think you're close
to the type we're looking for.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:32.901
Yeah?

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:36.237
Well, I've done a lot
of good work, you know.

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:41.326
Shorts, features. No major roles yet,
but it's all been really good stuff.

01:01:41.534 --> 01:01:44.746
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

01:01:44.954 --> 01:01:49.793
I like your looks.
I particularly liked you in this film.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:53.463
I remember that.
It was made by some college kids.

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:55.423
It was called Slave of Love.

01:01:55.632 --> 01:02:00.387
God, I don't know what it was called.
I only got $25 for the whole thing.

01:02:00.595 --> 01:02:02.597
Well, I liked you in it.

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.809
I also liked the girl.
I really thought she was good.

01:02:06.017 --> 01:02:10.897
- I was wondering, is she still around?
- Just wait a minute.

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:15.235
I need the work,
and I want to be in your picture,

01:02:15.443 --> 01:02:18.405
but that is one bitch
that I will not work with again.

01:02:18.613 --> 01:02:20.740
That was one freaky bitch, man.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.201
I don't know what she was into or on.

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:26.746
I just don't want anything
to do with her again.

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:31.418
My prick was so red and sore,
I couldn't walk for a goddamn week-

01:02:41.636 --> 01:02:44.222
Cheer up, you're not dead.

01:02:49.519 --> 01:02:54.024
Come on, sit up, trash, we're going
to take a little shower together.

01:03:05.201 --> 01:03:06.911
OK, that's it.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:11.624
- Don't hit me any more, all right?
- Where's the girl? Where is she?

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:14.127
This guy worked her.
His name is Tod.

01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:17.881
- Where does he hang out?
- I don't know, man.

01:03:18.757 --> 01:03:23.219
- Where?
- Look, I know this chick named Niki.

01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:28.558
She works at Les Girls. She would
know. She knows where he lives.

01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:45.218
- You have a girl here named Niki?
- In the booths. Any of the first three.

01:04:47.762 --> 01:04:50.223
That'll be $5 for two minutes.

01:04:50.432 --> 01:04:53.476
It's $5 a token.

01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:57.522
I'll take two.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.490
- Hello.
- Are you Niki?

01:05:48.698 --> 01:05:54.037
Sure, like in Mick ey and Nicky?
Did you see that picture?

01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:57.707
No.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:01.127
Too bad. I wasn't in it.

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:04.255
Well, it's your money. You talk.

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:07.884
I'm making a film. Jim Sloan is in it.

01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:11.638
He thought you might know
where Tod is.

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.017
Don't I know you?

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:19.521
Weren't you on the set the other night
with Ramada?

01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:24.609
- You making a feature?
- Live sound.

01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:28.863
You got any parts? I'm free.
I don't really do this.

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:33.994
Jim and I are trying
to run down this girl.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:37.288
Do you know her?

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:41.292
I can't see shit without my glasses.
Joanne?

01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:45.171
- You know her?
- No. I seen her with Tod.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.048
Do you know where she lives?

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:49.384
Do you know
where she might be found?

01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:01.521
Where is she?

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:05.233
- Well, Tod might know.
- Where is he?

01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:08.653
The last I heard,
he went to San Diego.

01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:14.367
If we went down there, do you think
you'd be able to find him?

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:20.582
You're not a film producer, are you?

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:25.128
How much do you make a week,
Niki?

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:27.088
You a private detective?

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:29.215
Something like that. How much?

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:34.846
Here? What a joke. There was some
other detective asking about that girl.

01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:37.349
$300?

01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:42.771
This is just temporary.
I once made $900 in outcall.

01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:47.359
I'll give you $700 a week, cash,
if you'll help me find this girl.

01:07:47.567 --> 01:07:50.487
- Up front?
- Half now, half later.

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:56.284
Make it $900.
That was my best week.

01:07:57.619 --> 01:08:00.246
OK. My client pays for it anyway.

01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:04.167
- Well, when do we start?
- Tonight. When you get out of here.

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:26.189
Mr Mast?

01:08:26.398 --> 01:08:30.359
I'm Wes DeJong,
Jake VanDorn's brother-in-law.

01:08:30.568 --> 01:08:33.321
We met a couple of months ago
when he hired you.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:35.782
Your agency said you might be here.

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:39.868
I'm on a stake-out.

01:08:43.747 --> 01:08:46.626
I'm staking out this beer bottle.

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:55.385
- I'm worried about Jake.
- I'm off that case. He fired me.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:58.971
I want to rehire you.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:03.852
I also want you
to protect my brother-in-law.

01:09:05.185 --> 01:09:08.398
He's an angry, unhappy man.

01:09:08.606 --> 01:09:14.446
Yeah, unhappy. You can see that.
I'm very sensitive to people's psychology.

01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:18.616
$750 a week, plus travel expenses.

01:09:31.212 --> 01:09:35.216
You actually paid
for both these rooms?

01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:39.136
I thought you'd just get a receipt
for two and kickback the deskman.

01:09:42.557 --> 01:09:45.477
You going somewhere?
I thought you were going to bed.

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:47.395
I am.

01:09:47.604 --> 01:09:50.523
You have any pills?
Any Valium or Librium?

01:09:50.732 --> 01:09:54.903
Do you know pimps sell Valium
for 50 cents? Can you believe that?

01:09:55.111 --> 01:09:57.322
I think I'm really fucked up.

01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:59.866
I'm a Venusian.

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:05.497
The Venusian Church.
You know, Venus, goddess of love.

01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:08.750
Venus, goddess of love...

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.090
Take it easy, Niki. Calm down.

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.550
We're gonna have a little talk.

01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:21.304
You'll go to your room and we'll both
get a good night's sleep.

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:27.227
You got anything to drink?
You want to go out?

01:10:27.435 --> 01:10:30.230
I don't drink,
but you can go out if you want to.

01:10:30.438 --> 01:10:34.567
- You don't drink?
- Ulcers.

01:10:37.737 --> 01:10:40.782
You're not a private detective, either,
are you?

01:10:43.034 --> 01:10:46.287
I didn't think so.
I've fucked detectives.

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:48.498
Who are you?

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:52.627
- A friend.
- Joanne's?

01:10:55.296 --> 01:10:57.799
I'm her father.

01:10:58.008 --> 01:10:59.926
Jesus.

01:11:01.094 --> 01:11:05.223
Her name's Kristen. She disappeared
a couple of months ago.

01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:09.269
- Where's your wife?
- She's dead.

01:11:12.147 --> 01:11:13.773
Look, don't worry about it.

01:11:13.982 --> 01:11:17.736
Your daughter's around.
We'll find her in a couple of days.

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:37.380
You know what your problem is?

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:42.427
You think negatively.
You're a very negative person.

01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:45.263
I mean,
you got to believe in something.

01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:48.475
What do they believe in the...
What church?

01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:53.355
Dutch Reformation.
It's a Calvinist denomination.

01:11:55.148 --> 01:11:59.944
Do they believe in reincarnation?
I believe in reincarnation.

01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:02.030
They believe in the TULIP.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:06.451
What the crap?

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:10.330
It's an acronym.
It comes from the Canons of Dort.

01:12:12.165 --> 01:12:15.585
Every letter stands
for a different belief, like...

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:18.380
Are you sure you want to hear this?

01:12:18.588 --> 01:12:21.800
Please go on. I'm a Venusian myself.

01:12:23.009 --> 01:12:26.721
T stands for Total Depravity.

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:30.976
All men, through original sin,
are totally evil and incapable of good.

01:12:31.184 --> 01:12:36.064
"All my works are as filthy rags
in the sight of the Lord."

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:44.030
That's what the Venusians call
negative moral attitudes.

01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:47.033
Well, be that as it may.

01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:50.870
U stands for Unconditional Election.

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:54.666
God has chosen a certain number
of people to be saved, the Elect.

01:12:54.874 --> 01:12:57.711
And he's chosen them
from the beginning of time.

01:12:57.919 --> 01:13:00.046
I is for Limited Atonement.

01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:03.341
Only a number of people
will be atoned and go to heaven.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.802
I is for Irresistible Grace.

01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:09.014
God's grace
cannot be resisted or denied.

01:13:09.222 --> 01:13:11.391
P is for
the Perseverance of the Saints.

01:13:11.599 --> 01:13:16.062
Once you're in grace, you cannot fall
from the numbers of the Elect.

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:23.111
Before you can become saved,
God already knows who you are?

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.157
Yes, he'd have to.
That's predestination.

01:13:27.365 --> 01:13:31.077
I mean, if God is omniscient,
if he knows everything,

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:33.330
and he wouldn't be God if he didn't,

01:13:33.538 --> 01:13:36.791
then he must have known,
before the creation of the world,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.253
the names of those
who would be saved.

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:45.342
Well, then it's all worked out.
It's fixed.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.053
More or less.

01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:50.597
I thought I was fucked up.

01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:55.602
I'll admit it's confusing
from the outside.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:58.772
You have to try to look at it
from the inside.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:02.317
If you look at anything from the inside
it makes sense.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:04.611
You should hear perverts talk.

01:14:04.819 --> 01:14:10.325
A guy once almost convinced me to
let his German shepherd screw me.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.661
It's not quite the same thing.

01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:18.583
- It doesn't make any sense to me.
- Flight to San Diego now boarding.

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:21.169
I think that's our plane.

01:14:22.712 --> 01:14:25.507
Want me to help you with that?

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:43.692
Jim Rucker runs this place.
He knows where everybody is.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:47.445
It's a nice place. He hires a lot of girls.

01:14:53.618 --> 01:14:56.413
Is Rucker here?

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:02.419
He'll be back in a couple of hours.

01:15:02.627 --> 01:15:04.838
Tell him Louise was here.
I'll come back.

01:15:05.046 --> 01:15:07.757
You want anything?

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:29.195
You shouldn't eat all that junk.

01:15:29.404 --> 01:15:31.990
At least I'm a growing person.

01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:35.118
You won't keep growing long
at this rate.

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:37.620
Don't start coming down on me.

01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:40.081
You know, what I do is important.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.293
A lot of guys can't talk
to their wives or girlfriends.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:45.837
They talk to me.
I make them feel better.

01:15:46.046 --> 01:15:48.131
I'm just like a therapist.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.469
You know, there's a professor
at UCLA writing a book about me.

01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:55.722
What do you think I do,
just suck off guys all day?

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.558
You think I'm just a fuck face?

01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:02.812
You can't even say it, can you?

01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:06.524
Say what?

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:13.990
Sucking off.

01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:16.368
All right. Sucking off.

01:16:16.576 --> 01:16:19.621
Now, does that
make me as good as you?

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:23.750
You don't understand shit.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:28.588
When I was 15,
I was turning tricks in Vegas.

01:16:28.797 --> 01:16:32.467
I was taking
all the older girls' regular customers.

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:34.928
It wasn't my fault.

01:16:35.136 --> 01:16:38.556
They put out a contract on me.
I didn't know it was illegal.

01:16:38.765 --> 01:16:40.433
Niki, don't go on, please.

01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:44.688
You and I, we just have very different
ideas about sex, that's all.

01:16:44.896 --> 01:16:49.359
Why? Are you a sex fiend?

01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:55.532
- Neither am I.
- That's all you do.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.328
It's not all...
How important do you think sex is?

01:17:01.955 --> 01:17:06.543
- Not very.
- Well, then we're just alike.

01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:11.047
I mean, you think it's so unimportant
that you don't even do it.

01:17:11.256 --> 01:17:14.968
I think it's so unimportant
that I don't care who I do it with.

01:17:15.176 --> 01:17:18.513
We're not alike. You could never
understand a person like me.

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:24.185
I'm a mystery to you. A middle-class
person. A Midwesterner.

01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:26.479
Goes to church. Believes in God.

01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:30.817
Who believes that at the end
of his life, he'll be redeemed.

01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:32.986
It doesn't make any sense to you.

01:17:33.194 --> 01:17:36.031
I don't know why I should
justify myself to you.

01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:38.408
I don't care about things
you care about.

01:17:38.616 --> 01:17:42.537
I don't care what's happening
in Los Angeles or New York.

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:47.625
I don't care about the movies or TV.
I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.

01:17:48.626 --> 01:17:51.296
What do you care about?

01:17:53.298 --> 01:17:55.925
I care about my daughter.

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:05.226
Hey, Rucker.

01:18:05.435 --> 01:18:11.066
Remember me? Louise.
Rhymes with squeeze.

01:18:13.234 --> 01:18:15.528
You working in San Diego now?

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:19.658
No, I'm still up in LA. I was looking
for Tod. I heard he was around.

01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:23.828
Was. He and that shitheel Ratan
went down to TJ.

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:29.292
Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway,
I hear he's back in Frisco now.

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:33.380
- Was he with a girl?
- No.

01:18:36.966 --> 01:18:39.970
Keep in touch, baby.

01:18:43.598 --> 01:18:47.060
- What's TJ?
- Tijuana.

01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:50.814
- Were they here?
- Tod was.

01:18:51.022 --> 01:18:54.234
- He was with Ratan.
- What does that mean?

01:18:54.442 --> 01:18:58.363
- What does he do?
- He deals in pain.

01:18:58.571 --> 01:19:01.032
Is Kristen safe?

01:19:03.618 --> 01:19:06.538
Let's get a plane to San Francisco.

01:19:14.671 --> 01:19:17.799
Apparently your friend slipped down
into San Diego.

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:20.510
Now he's headed up
to San Francisco.

01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:24.472
How's it feel to have the LAPD
doing your police work for you?

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:29.644
You're going to thank me for this.
The media loves this kind of shit.

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:32.731
Real family drama.
Runaway daughter, enraged father.

01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:35.150
They eat it up. It helps their ratings.

01:19:35.358 --> 01:19:39.654
Now, if this guy goes off half-cocked
and gets himself hurt...

01:19:40.947 --> 01:19:45.452
you're gonna get such
bad publicity, you won't believe it.

01:19:46.411 --> 01:19:48.496
You think this guy will get in trouble?

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:52.208
He's a religious type. You figure it.

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:06.514
Tod'll meet you at that bookstore
down there at 4.00 tomorrow.

01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:09.100
I told him
you were a specialty customer.

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:12.103
Why can't I meet him now?

01:20:16.024 --> 01:20:19.402
- He's busy now.
- Where does he live?

01:20:21.863 --> 01:20:26.910
I'm risking my ass.
We'll do it my way, OK?

01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:38.672
I've been in more motel rooms this
week than I have in the rest of my life.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.425
Yeah, I know what you mean.
After a while they all look the same.

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.637
They are the same.

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:50.684
Do you live in a house,
back in wherever?

01:20:50.892 --> 01:20:53.061
Grand Rapids? Of course.

01:20:53.269 --> 01:20:57.190
On your own land?
Just you and your daughter?

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:04.155
I don't know your daughter.

01:21:04.364 --> 01:21:06.324
But...

01:21:07.659 --> 01:21:09.536
But what?

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.087
I wouldn't expect too much
about her coming back.

01:21:19.295 --> 01:21:21.923
What makes you so sure?

01:21:23.591 --> 01:21:27.804
- Your wife isn't dead, is she?
- Why do you say that?

01:21:30.056 --> 01:21:33.518
It's just a guess.
She isn't dead though, is she?

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.692
Where is she now?

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.611
Back East somewhere.
It doesn't matter.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.157
- Does your daughter know?
- Of course.

01:21:50.952 --> 01:21:53.496
Your wife left you, right?

01:21:55.373 --> 01:21:57.959
Her name was Joanne too.
How'd you know?

01:22:00.879 --> 01:22:03.590
Just a guess. What was the problem?

01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:07.344
Sex? Always is.

01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:12.015
I really don't blame you
for saying that, really.

01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:18.271
It's this culture. Everything's
based on sex. Sold on sex.

01:22:19.522 --> 01:22:22.525
Magazines, music, TV.

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:26.571
Buy this because of sex.
Use that because of sex.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.449
Kids, they think it's normal.

01:22:29.658 --> 01:22:33.119
They think they're supposed to talk
dirty, wear scanty clothes.

01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:36.623
Hey, don't get upset. I lied, too.

01:22:36.831 --> 01:22:39.334
I don't make no $500.

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:42.962
I don't make anything.
Everything I make goes to Granville.

01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:46.633
- Where?
- Granville.

01:22:46.841 --> 01:22:50.428
My old man. Pimp to you.

01:22:51.846 --> 01:22:54.849
I split
'cause he didn't treat me for shit.

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:57.435
He thinks he's so cool.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:23:00.605
You know,
once I tried to take my clothes-

01:23:00.814 --> 01:23:05.068
This really isn't any of my business.
I don't want to know about it.

01:23:05.276 --> 01:23:08.238
So I guess we're both fucked?

01:23:08.446 --> 01:23:11.241
At least you get to go to heaven.
I don't get shit.

01:23:27.674 --> 01:23:29.634
Pilgrim.

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:33.888
This is just how you found me once.

01:23:35.223 --> 01:23:37.058
What are you doing here?

01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:40.061
I felt like such a shit
after what I did to you.

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:42.105
Not that I did anything wrong.

01:23:42.314 --> 01:23:45.358
But I kept investigating,
poking around.

01:23:45.567 --> 01:23:47.819
There's some poor SOB in LA,

01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:52.782
with his face bent out of shape where
you damaged his movie career.

01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:56.119
It's lucky for him
no one looks at his face.

01:23:56.328 --> 01:23:59.831
- The police want to arrest me?
- Nah.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.917
They don't care
about some faggot hustler.

01:24:03.126 --> 01:24:06.463
They're more interested
in your daughter's health and yours.

01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:09.883
- Like I am.
- Yeah, sure.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:14.346
You're way out on a limb.
You don't know what you're into.

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:18.975
- You sure haven't been any help.
- I'm sorry about that.

01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:20.977
What have you found out? Tell me.

01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:23.730
Why don't you tell me something
for a change?

01:24:23.938 --> 01:24:25.649
Like what?

01:24:25.857 --> 01:24:28.276
Who's Ratan?

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.698
- Where did you hear that name?
- I just heard. Who is he?

01:24:53.093 --> 01:24:58.556
You know, you can buy anything
on this earth. Child whores, slaves.

01:24:58.765 --> 01:25:02.686
Have people raped and killed.

01:25:02.894 --> 01:25:07.899
One of the men who supposedly
arranges such things is called Ratan.

01:25:08.108 --> 01:25:12.278
- How did you hear about him?
- Just a name.

01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:18.952
Don't do anything more.
I'll find out what I can.

01:25:21.538 --> 01:25:24.874
- She know anything about this?
- Who, the whore?

01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:29.170
No, she's the victim. A dime a dozen.

01:26:34.861 --> 01:26:37.322
What's happening?

01:26:40.116 --> 01:26:44.079
I hear you've got
some money to spend.

01:26:44.287 --> 01:26:49.542
I hear you're interested in...
interesting things.

01:26:51.961 --> 01:26:54.631
Come on.

01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:18.613
Do you work for San Francisco PD

01:27:18.822 --> 01:27:23.243
or do you have any other affiliation
with any law enforcement agency?

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:27.372
What you got in mind?

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.582
I want to meet...

01:27:30.875 --> 01:27:33.753
Ratan.

01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:38.508
What is that? Some kind of chair?
I never heard of no Ratan.

01:27:40.343 --> 01:27:46.099
I'm told that there are certain things
that only Ratan can provide.

01:27:46.308 --> 01:27:49.644
Are you talking
about real excitement?

01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:54.482
I heard that you and him
just come back from Mexico

01:27:54.691 --> 01:27:58.862
and you got a picture
where a girl gets... You know.

01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.573
Who told you this?

01:28:01.781 --> 01:28:04.409
Rucker.

01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:09.331
I don't know no Ratan,
but I may be able to help you out.

01:28:09.539 --> 01:28:14.044
It's not me, you understand.
It's just helping out a friend.

01:28:14.252 --> 01:28:18.089
It'll cost you 100 bucks
for a single screening.

01:28:18.298 --> 01:28:20.717
The one
with the girl named Kristen in it?

01:28:23.553 --> 01:28:25.555
You got the money?

01:28:26.514 --> 01:28:29.184
Take it or leave it.

01:28:29.392 --> 01:28:31.519
OK.

01:28:35.106 --> 01:28:40.487
Meet me here today at 8 o'clock.
With the money.

01:28:40.695 --> 01:28:43.156
Then we'll go see the film.

01:28:43.365 --> 01:28:44.908
Good.

01:28:45.116 --> 01:28:47.786
You ain't never going to have
no thrill like this.

01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:25.276
What's the matter with your room?

01:31:25.485 --> 01:31:28.029
- TV's broke.
- Yeah?

01:31:28.238 --> 01:31:30.448
Well, this one's broke, too.

01:31:31.741 --> 01:31:35.370
How about the bed? Is that working?

01:31:37.122 --> 01:31:43.294
- Granville's looking for you, Niki.
- My name ain't Niki.

01:31:43.503 --> 01:31:45.714
It's Pattica, you know, like in Attica.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.550
Real nice.

01:31:48.758 --> 01:31:50.802
Granville's looking for you anyway.

01:31:51.011 --> 01:31:53.888
- Who's that?
- You know.

01:31:54.097 --> 01:31:59.811
The dude with the big white car.
The guy who bought you that ring.

01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:05.567
I know that boy. He can make life
real tough on a working girl.

01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:09.154
He can get you strung out again.

01:32:10.238 --> 01:32:13.283
He'll get you sniffing and then snorting
and shooting.

01:32:13.491 --> 01:32:16.453
You both can fuck off.

01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:19.622
You're taking a big chance.

01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:22.709
I don't plan
on seeing him again, anyway.

01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:25.754
Oh, no?
What are you gonna do, get a job?

01:32:25.962 --> 01:32:30.800
Office temporaries?
Computer programmer?

01:32:31.009 --> 01:32:32.719
Cosmetologist?

01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:37.974
- Jake will take care of me.
- Who? VanDorn?

01:32:39.142 --> 01:32:42.187
You gotta be kidding yourself, honey.

01:32:42.395 --> 01:32:46.441
You think once he finds his daughter
he's gonna think about you?

01:32:49.778 --> 01:32:54.532
No way, kid.
You'll be strictly yesterday's papers.

01:33:03.124 --> 01:33:05.251
- What did you find out?
- Leave me alone.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.921
I'm here to help you.

01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:12.342
All right.

01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:18.848
Did you find out where she is?

01:33:19.057 --> 01:33:22.894
Tod disappeared. I've got to find him.
Where does he live?

01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:25.230
- What happened?
- Where is he?

01:33:25.438 --> 01:33:28.733
- I can't tell you that.
- Listen to me, young lady.

01:33:28.942 --> 01:33:31.444
My daughter's been missing
for five months.

01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:35.490
I've gone through a lot to find out
what's happened.

01:33:35.699 --> 01:33:37.951
I saw Ratan kill a girl.

01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:43.748
Now, I am not gonna let this Tod
slip through my hands. Where is he?

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:46.084
But then you'll forget about me.

01:33:49.212 --> 01:33:53.425
Some bondage house. A black
storefront off Kearney and Broadway.

01:33:53.633 --> 01:33:56.261
He works there.

01:34:01.891 --> 01:34:04.561
I won't forget you.

01:34:10.275 --> 01:34:13.486
What are you doing, Pilgrim?
Look, where are you going?

01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:16.698
Let me take care of this.
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:34:16.906 --> 01:34:20.285
Look, don't do anything
till the police get there.

01:34:30.754 --> 01:34:34.215
Look, you got to tell me
where he's gone.

01:34:36.509 --> 01:34:39.763
Hello, Police? My name's Mast.
Get me Joe Klein in Vice.

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:21.680
Hello, come on in.

01:35:23.848 --> 01:35:26.685
Have a seat.

01:35:29.521 --> 01:35:32.440
- Now, you need some information?
- Yeah.

01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:34.359
We offer...

01:35:35.527 --> 01:35:39.531
What are you interested in? We offer
verbal humiliation, bondage-

01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:43.702
- I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
- Tod?

01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:47.539
- I don't know anyone named Tod.
- What girls do you have here?

01:35:47.747 --> 01:35:53.086
- Well, I'm Hope. This is Faith, Charity.
- All you have is three girls?

01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:56.673
I think you've made a mistake.
Check down the street.

01:35:56.881 --> 01:35:58.925
- I know he's here.
- Wait a minute.

01:36:17.902 --> 01:36:19.654
What do you want?

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:23.616
You didn't like the movie?
Listen, I got another one.

01:36:23.825 --> 01:36:28.371
I want my daughter.
Her name is Kristen. Or Joanne.

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:32.042
- She was with you.
- I don't know what you're on about.

01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:34.586
The police know about Ratan.

01:36:34.794 --> 01:36:38.673
They know he's here with you.
They know everything.

01:36:41.217 --> 01:36:44.095
Well, goody for them.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:37:56.293 --> 01:37:59.921
- Where's Ratan? Where is he?
- Let go-

01:38:08.847 --> 01:38:14.644
- Where is he?
- The El Matador. He goes there.

01:39:14.204 --> 01:39:16.247
Don't move, Ratan.

01:39:16.456 --> 01:39:18.833
Freeze, asshole.

01:40:20.854 --> 01:40:23.648
Don't hurt me.

01:40:26.067 --> 01:40:29.487
I know it's been terrible for you,
but it's over now, honey.

01:40:37.912 --> 01:40:40.957
You can come home now.

01:40:44.085 --> 01:40:46.338
It doesn't matter
what they made you do.

01:40:49.174 --> 01:40:52.052
They didn't make me do anything.

01:40:54.179 --> 01:40:56.890
I wanted to leave.

01:40:58.141 --> 01:41:00.894
That's not true, baby.

01:41:01.102 --> 01:41:04.564
You didn't want to leave.
They took you away.

01:41:05.482 --> 01:41:07.484
I love you.

01:41:07.692 --> 01:41:10.737
Don't touch me, you cocksucker.

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:14.616
You never gave a fuck
about me before.

01:41:14.824 --> 01:41:17.410
You didn't.

01:41:17.619 --> 01:41:19.663
So don't touch me now.

01:41:21.373 --> 01:41:25.293
I didn't fit into your goddamned world.

01:41:25.502 --> 01:41:27.796
I wasn't pretty
or good enough for you.

01:41:29.172 --> 01:41:33.134
You never approved of any of my
friends. You drove them all away.

01:41:34.886 --> 01:41:37.389
I'm with people who love me now.

01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:41.601
You robbed my life.

01:41:47.524 --> 01:41:50.485
God, baby.

01:41:51.611 --> 01:41:54.447
I do love you.

01:41:55.448 --> 01:41:58.243
I just never knew how to show you.

01:41:59.494 --> 01:42:03.289
It's very difficult for me.
Nobody ever taught me.

01:42:05.667 --> 01:42:08.169
I tried.

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:14.843
It's just my damnable pride.

01:42:16.761 --> 01:42:19.514
Just get away.

01:42:19.723 --> 01:42:22.309
Please.

01:42:36.197 --> 01:42:38.950
You really want me to go?

01:42:44.789 --> 01:42:46.249
No.

01:42:52.881 --> 01:42:55.091
Then you take me home.

01:43:11.399 --> 01:43:13.693
Clear a way, now.

01:43:42.138 --> 01:43:48.228
Guys, come on. Let's break it up.
There's nothing to see. It's all over.

01:43:54.609 --> 01:43:58.697
Niki, maybe I've...
Maybe there's some way I can...

01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:17.507
Think you could do something
for her? Maybe money?

01:44:17.716 --> 01:44:20.343
Go home, Pilgrim.

01:44:20.552 --> 01:44:24.806
There's nothing you can do.
You don't belong here.
