-Forty grand.

Sorry for the late notice.
I'll keep it brief.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.720
But I have
a very important announcement.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.040
The decision has been made

03:19.120 --> 03:21.160
to close the Protection unit
immediately.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.920
-You're kidding me.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.840
[Ann] As you know,
we have to reduce the budget,

03:24.920 --> 03:27.240
and the staff to prisoner ratio
in Protection

03:27.320 --> 03:30.000
makes the cost of running it
prohibitive.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.280
The bad news is there will be
staff retrenchments.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.800
The good news is that it
won't involve senior officers.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
When's it happening?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.080
Listening ears, Deputy Governor.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.360
I said immediately. So today.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.560
Mr. Jackson will oversee
the prisoner relocation.

Would you like to
make your objection official?

Well, does it have to be
so sudden?

Could you give us some time
to tell--

03:59.840 --> 04:01.280

04:05.560 --> 04:07.680
I have to show them
real fiscal evidence

04:07.760 --> 04:10.040

resources.

Especially since that disaster
with the food supply.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.600
And I'm not blaming you, OK?

04:15.680 --> 04:18.600
We're a team here,
so let's make this work, yeah?

[Allie]
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

From management.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.320
Look, it's up to us to make sure
it happens without incident.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.320
"Us"? As in you and me?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.080
I need you to make it clear
to the women

04:43.160 --> 04:45.760
that these ex-Protection
prisoners are off limits.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.000
You seriously want me to help
you after you bugged my cell?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.880
I told you. The authorities
had a special powers warrant.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.080
We had no choice.
We had to cooperate.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.120
Yeah, well, I do have a choice
and I don't have to cooperate.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.440
Allie, we need
to work together on this.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.760
You bugged my cell.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.040
Wait, this doesn't include
Marie, right?

05:10.120 --> 05:13.320
Tell me that she's not being
released back into General.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.160
Are you going to guarantee
Ruby's safety?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.600
Winter has retracted her
statement against Mitchell.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.880
Yeah, and what if that
was just a trick?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do, Governor.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.360
I'll guarantee the safety of
every Protection unit prisoner.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.760
Except one. Marie Winter
can take her chances.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.240
That there are four types
of oppression.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.720
It's personal, interpersonal,
institutional and cultural.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.680
Yep, and there is also the shit
that happens in here, eh.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.320
That's institutional, Booms.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.600
Yeah. And then there's,
like, the oppression

05:55.680 --> 05:59.240
of, like,
Daz reading Missy's stuff

05:59.320 --> 06:00.760
and Trina, like,
rubbing me nose in it.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.360
That's personal.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.040
Oh, yeah, no.
I don't want to talk about it.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.280
You and I both know that me
going back into General

-Sure.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.400
Hey, I know it feels like
I sprung this on you,

07:21.480 --> 07:22.680
but it was always
part of the plan.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.280
So, you planned this
from the start?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.720
Yeah. You don't get where I am

07:25.800 --> 07:28.040
by flying by the seat
of your pants, Vera.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.200
Right. But I wish you'd told me,
maybe...

07:30.280 --> 07:31.920
before you enticed me
back to work.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.640
You know my mandate.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.280
Bring law and order
back to Wentworth,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.840
slash the budget,
make the prison pay for itself.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.640
Closing Protection
will hardly bring order.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.840
It will be chaos.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.680
Possibly. For the short term.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.720
So how does that fit
your mandate?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.880
We're not in the business of
pandering to lawbreakers, Vera.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.920
It's not a zoo, Ann.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.840
They are not animals,
they're people.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.360
Who have committed crimes.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.600
And they are in here paying for.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.880
Our mandate should be
to send them out

07:56.960 --> 07:58.600
into the real world
better people.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.000
You've spent most of your career
in a bubble, Vera.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.240
And I haven't.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
I have actually been out there,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
in the real world,

08:04.480 --> 08:07.320
where the public want to see
criminals pay for their crimes.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
We still have a duty
to protect them.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.720
As far as I'm concerned, when
they broke the social contract,

08:11.800 --> 08:13.160
they forfeited their right

08:13.240 --> 08:17.000
to any form
of state-sanctioned protection.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.000
All right. Well,
you're forgetting another thing.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.200
This decision puts the staff
in danger as well.

Joan Ferguson is alive.

I'm sorry. What?

She turned up in a hospital,
alive, but in coma.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.640
Well, yes, given...

09:17.720 --> 09:22.480
she was found dead in a box,
buried in the ground.

that wasn't Ferguson in the box.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.720
DNA analysis told us that.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.800
You did not tell us that.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.440
We didn't tell anyone.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.920
We didn't want that information
getting out.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.600
We wanted Ferguson to relax.

We were trying to lure her out.

Just not in the manner
we expected.

It wasn't her.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.400
They used Maxwell's sister's DNA
to confirm the match.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.160
[Jake] How did she get
out of the ground?

11:22.120 --> 11:23.440
It's me.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.640
I need your help.
Listen to me very carefully.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.480
[Vera]<i> Police think</i>
<i>she contacted Murphy,</i>

11:28.560 --> 11:30.600
-just before her escape attempt.
-Murphy?

11:30.680 --> 11:32.480
They found Ferguson's
fingerprints

11:32.560 --> 11:35.280
in Brenda Murphy's house
when they searched it,

11:35.360 --> 11:36.840
after Channing shot her.

11:36.920 --> 11:41.240
<i>Murphy probably followed Will</i>
<i>from the depot...</i>

11:43.400 --> 11:44.960
<i>and watched him bury her.</i>

11:50.920 --> 11:52.560

11:54.040 --> 11:57.480
And then what? They came up
with this plan to extort us?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.480
Which involved...

11:59.560 --> 12:02.800
putting someone else
in that box.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.200
<i>So when we panicked enough</i>
<i>to go and dig her up...</i>

12:07.280 --> 12:11.560
<i>there'd be a body in there</i>
<i>that looks like her.</i>

12:11.640 --> 12:14.400
Why didn't she just take off
after Murphy was killed?

12:14.480 --> 12:16.360
She was trying
to get money together.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.360
They arrested the guy
that assaulted her.

12:18.440 --> 12:21.240
He had a backpack
with nearly $30,000 in it

12:21.320 --> 12:23.480
which they think was hers.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.440
Maybe she'll never wake up.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.480
[knock on door]

12:35.320 --> 12:36.800
Sorry.
Mustn't have got the memo.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.520
What is it, Linda?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.080
We're about to move
the Protection prisoners.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.560
You forget about the meeting

Thank you.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.120

The prisoners
will be put in units

12:50.120 --> 12:53.040

historical grievances with them.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.600
If you'd like to refer
to your schedule,

12:55.680 --> 12:58.520
you'll see where
they are to be relocated.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.520
-Where's Winter going?
-H...

13:00.600 --> 13:03.760
H5. That has prisoners that
weren't involved in the siege.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.600
Wasn't just prisoners
in the siege.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.520
[Will] All officers must be
vigilant to avoid any incidents.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.560
That means particular focus
on Winter.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.920
-Any questions?
-Are the rumours true?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.520
Word is Ferguson's alive.

-Fuckin' cunts!

use the phones.

I don't know whether
to be relieved

15:01.000 --> 15:03.600
or feel guilty about Ferguson.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.760
I'm relieved I'm not a murderer.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.680
-Is that wrong?
-Of course not.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.200
Yeah, but I've dumped us
in the shit, Vera. She's--

15:10.280 --> 15:12.720
-Mr. Jackson.
-What is it, Novak?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.480
Judy Bryant.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.600
She should be allowed
to contact her father.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.360
It's an abuse
of her human rights.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.880
Bryant's being held
on terrorism charges.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.000
Well, there's a problem
with her lawyer.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.200
Which means no contact

15:24.280 --> 15:25.560

15:31.240 --> 15:32.960

of the charges,
