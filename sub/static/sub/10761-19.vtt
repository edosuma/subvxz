00:16.000 --> 00:17.600
There he is, Niles.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.200
That's our Yorick.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.600
He's perfect, Frasier.

00:25.300 --> 00:29.100
<i>The missing link
for our backyard production of Hamlet.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.700
Exactly what I was thinking.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.800
Now get up there.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.900
- Why me?
- Because I'm the director, that's why.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.500
Come on.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.600
Just get up there.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.600
- "Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him... "
- Knock it off. Ow.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.400
- Are you okay?
- No.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.100
You cracked my skull.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.000
May I get a double latte?

01:05.300 --> 01:07.100
One shot decaf espresso,
one shot of regular espresso,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.700
streamed low-fat milk
and some non-fat foam.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.500
Sure.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.100
Well?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
He didn't even blink an eye.
The man's unflappable.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.300
He's amazing, isn't he?

01:21.600 --> 01:25.400
He made me a Chai Spice
Ristretto-Americano con Panna

01:25.800 --> 01:28.600
as if people had been drinking them
for centuries.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.000
Truly, this is a golden age.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.800
Oh, did Dad tell you?
Our old house is on the market.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.200
It doesn't surprise me.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.100
That whole area's undergoing
what they call a revitalization.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.500
Of course, they'll probably just tear
it down and put up a Benetton.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.400
Bath & Body Works
or Sunglass Hut.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.400
I sort of like Bath & Body Works.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.400
I do, too.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.300
I had this crazy thought, Frasier.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.100
What if we bought the house?

01:54.900 --> 01:56.300
You mean as a rental property?

01:56.400 --> 02:01.100
Perhaps. Or as a guest maisonette
for our out-of-town visitors.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.700
- Daphne's mother, perhaps?
- Oh, hadn't thought of that.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.100
That's a good idea.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.300
Buy her a house
and she'll never leave.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.200
You know, Niles, we could open it up
to the general public.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.100
- That's not a bad idea. A warm bed...
- A freshly baked scone.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.600
- A moderate fee.
- It would pay for itself.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.400
As B and B.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.700
If you two break into song,
I'm leaving.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.100
- Hello, every...
- Roz, listen to this.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.300
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Have a seat.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.700
I just bought Alice a new hamster
and it's kept me up all night

02:34.800 --> 02:39.100
running around
on that squeaky, damn wheel.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.200
Why don't you get it
a quieter wheel?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.800
- Or oil the squeak?
- Or take the wheel out at night?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.500
Or put the cage in another room?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.500
Thank you.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.200
Where were you all
at 3 this morning

02:51.300 --> 02:54.500
when I was trying to shove a Sominex
into a carrot?

02:55.700 --> 02:59.500
I used to have the same problem
when I was raising showrats.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.200
You don't mean the nasty,
plague-propagating vermin, do you?

03:07.600 --> 03:13.800
No, I mean purebred rats,
as in Siamese or Himalayan or husky.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.100
My most prized one
was an Andalusian Blue

03:17.400 --> 03:20.500
named Lady Prissy
and she wasn't sick a day in her life.

03:20.900 --> 03:25.200
So don't go blaming all rats
just because of a few bad apples.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.600
A few bad apples?

03:27.800 --> 03:31.300
Daphne, they spread a disease
that nearly wiped out half of Europe.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.000
Shows what you know.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.200
Those were
common European brown rats.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.000
- Yes, but the point...
Oh, no, no.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.700
I'll sit here and listen to you
prattle on about wine and opera

03:41.000 --> 03:44.200
but when it comes to rats,
you're in my house.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.100
Old man Lasskopf
must have owned this place 50 years.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.400
Wonder why he's selling.
- He can get 50 times what he paid.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.800
Yeah, he sure knew how
to squeeze a penny.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.500
You know, he never gave me back
my security deposit.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.100
I might just bring that up.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.800
Oh, no, you won't.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.000
Once we turn this into a B and B,
you'll make it all back in tips.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.900
What the hell is that supposed to...

04:11.100 --> 04:13.000
Oh, Mr. Lasskopf,
so good to see you again.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.800
It's been a long time.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.700
What has?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.300
- We used to rent this house from you.
- Yes.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.899
I'm Niles Crane.
This is my brother Frasier and our dad.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.700
You remember?

04:24.100 --> 04:25.600
Nope.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.600
Nope.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.200
You sort of look familiar.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.500
I should. Paid you rent for ten years,
left the place in perfect condition,

04:32.900 --> 04:35.800
and you never gave me back
my security deposit.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.600
Nope, don't remember you either.
Come on in.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.900
Go ahead, Dad.

04:42.100 --> 04:46.000
Oh, boy, this brings back memories.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.200
Oh, Niles, do you remember

04:48.700 --> 04:50.500
doing our homework
at the dining room table?

04:50.700 --> 04:51.800
Oh, yes.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.700
Afternoon piano lessons.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.200
Getting haircuts from your mother.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.200
And Mom's roll-top desk
on this wall over here.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.000
<i>Where we wrote
all the Crane Boys Mysteries.</i>

05:03.800 --> 05:06.500
I can still see you pacing
in your writer's tweeds

05:06.800 --> 05:09.700
and half glasses, dictating.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.300
And you
in your shawl collar sweater,

05:12.600 --> 05:15.300
hammering away at the keys
of that old Royal typewriter.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.200
Oh, gosh.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.600
When did those two crazy kids

05:18.900 --> 05:21.700
become such a pair
of old fuddy-duddies?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.000
Oh, Niles.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.000
Do you remember, here's the window
we used to sneak out of after curfew.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.800
Really? You did?
I never knew that.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.300
Sure, Dad. We used to go out
and chase the girls

05:34.600 --> 05:36.800
and have a drink or two.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.500
Well, boys will be boys.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.200
- Frasier.
- Hmm?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.300
We didn't chase girls.
We went out to foreign films.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.000
Do you think Dad wants to hear that?
Throw the guy a bone.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.400
So, what made you finally decide
to sell?

05:56.700 --> 06:00.200
- Moving to the Cayman Islands.
- That'll be a change from Seattle.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.700
Gee, you think?

06:04.300 --> 06:06.700
Hear they have great scuba diving
down there. You scuba?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.500
Do I look like I scuba?

06:10.300 --> 06:13.600
I'm lucky I don't need a tank
to breathe on land.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.400
Just looking for a change of scenery,
huh?

06:16.700 --> 06:18.200
Looking to be left alone.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.300
I'm not what you call
a real social type.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.600
You sure made friends
with my security deposit.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.400
You know, Niles, you're right.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.400
It's not big enough
for a bed and breakfast.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.000
No, but it did give us a nice walk
down memory lane.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.800
Yes.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
Niles?

06:37.200 --> 06:41.200
Didn't we stash a memory box
underneath one of these floorboards

06:41.600 --> 06:42.600
right around here?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.900
What? I thought you took that with you
when we moved.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.100
I thought you took it.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.500
- Do you suppose it's still here?
- Well, it must be.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.100
Would you mind if my brother and I
had a look underneath here?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
You see, we left a sort
of a time capsule underneath there.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.600
Oh, no, you don't.
Nobody's pulling up any floor here.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.600
No, we don't need to.
The board was loose.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.800
There's no loose boards.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.200
They've all been nailed down.
I made sure of that.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.800
Couldn't we just check?
Look, I came here to sell this place,

07:09.100 --> 07:10.800
not have it torn apart.

07:10.900 --> 07:14.400
So are you serious buyers
or are we wasting our time here?

07:14.700 --> 07:18.200
Allowing us to reclaim a small part
of our past is hardly a waste of time.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.500
Well, it sounds like a load
of tomfoolery to me.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.700
- Let's go.
Mr. Lasskopf,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.400
I assure you my brother and I
give tomfoolery no quarter.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.800
- We never have.
Oh, no?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.300
What do you call sneaking out
to drink and chase girls?

07:32.500 --> 07:35.400
No, no, no, that wasn't true.
We went out to see foreign films.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.500
I knew it.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.000
No, no, wait.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.800
There we go.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.600
Well done, Frasier.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.500
- You've still got it.
- Thank you, Niles.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.700
It's just like riding a bicycle.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.900
- Here we go.
- All right,

08:03.100 --> 08:05.800
let's just find our memory box
and get the hell out of here.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.100
Now, I think it's around here
somewhere, hmm?

08:10.500 --> 08:11.900
It's, uh...

08:15.500 --> 08:18.500
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.
It's right there. This one, this one.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.700
Okay, okay.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.800
- Let's see if I can get this in here.
- That's it. There it is.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.800
- Good.
- Right. Oh, my gosh.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.900
Imagine that.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.100
That's it, that's it. I'll get that.
Yes, good. Well done.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.000
- Aha.
- Well done, Frasier.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, I think that's as far as it'll go.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.799
All right, reach your hand in there
and see what you can find.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.800
I'm not going to put my hand
down there. There could be rats.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.200
Maybe they're just
down-on-their-luck showrats.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.800
I know. What was that?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.600
Don't ask me. You're marrying her.
All right, I'll do it.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.400
All right. Careful, careful.

09:00.900 --> 09:05.100
All right, all right, I can see anything.
Oh, no, it's not there, is it?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.900
Well, I don't know.
Hang on a minute.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.500
- What?
- Hang on. Wait, wait, wait.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.500
- Yeah?
- Wait. My God. My God.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.800
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.200
There's something. Hang on, hang on.
Yeah, here it is.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.100
- Oh, my God, Niles, look!
- Don't give it to me!

09:23.400 --> 09:24.500
Is that real?

09:24.700 --> 09:26.000
It certainly feels real.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.900
Well, what's it doing under the floor?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.300
Well, how the hell should I know?

09:32.300 --> 09:34.800
I wonder who it could be.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.800
Well, perhaps it's a builder
who got trapped during construction.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.400
Or...

09:40.300 --> 09:43.200
an exterminator
who was overcome with fumes.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.100
Interesting hypotheses, Niles.
Unfortunately, neither is plausible.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.500
- Why not?
- Because, Niles,

09:47.700 --> 09:52.000
when you die your head
doesn't pop off like a champagne cork.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.800
It remains attached to the spine.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.500
And look here, Niles.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.900
The temporal bone
has been fractured...

10:03.500 --> 10:06.100
As if struck by a blunt object.

10:06.300 --> 10:11.600
So perhaps the poor fellow met his end
in some sort of violent accident.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.000
Violent, yes.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.500
But an accident?

10:22.300 --> 10:24.700
Murder.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.000
Murder most foul.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.400
Hey, Roz, Alice, come on in.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.100
Hey, Martin. Is Frasier home?

10:40.300 --> 10:42.700
No, he and Niles went out.
Wine club or something.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.400
- Uh, will he be back soon?
- Hard to say.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.400
Is everything all right?
You seem edgy.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.700
- Can I talk to you in the kitchen?
- Of course.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.100
Martin, can Alice watch TV with you
for a second?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.600
Oh, sure she can.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.900
What kind of TV do you like?

10:58.100 --> 11:00.000
- Cartoons.
Oh, really?

11:00.300 --> 11:01.400
Your mom lets you watch that?

11:01.700 --> 11:03.900
The anvils and dynamite,

11:04.100 --> 11:06.200
and people falling over cliffs
and things?

11:07.600 --> 11:11.100
Great. Then you should be
all over this hockey game.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.300
So, what's up?

11:14.600 --> 11:16.800
Do you remember Alice's hamster
I told you about?

11:17.100 --> 11:19.800
- Yes. Still keeping you awake?
- Not anymore.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.800
The dog ate it.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.600
Well, half of it.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.000
Oh, no. Something like that happened
when I was a girl.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.200
One of our cats
got into one of my rat cages

11:30.500 --> 11:34.500
and took Little Lord Pinkbottom
right out of show business.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.400
Well, I don't mind the hamster dying.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.900
I just don't know how to break it
to Alice.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.000
She's never had anything die before.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.600
Well, how did your parents explain it
to you?

11:46.100 --> 11:49.800
The wrong way.
When I was 6 my canary died.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.900
And that evening
my dad sat on the bed next to me

11:53.200 --> 11:57.900
and said, "Dying is just going to sleep
and never waking up. "

12:00.100 --> 12:03.100
Then he turned off the light
and said good night.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.500
Well, I'm sure Dr. Crane
will have some good advice

12:06.800 --> 12:07.700
on how to handle this.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.800
Yeah. I mean,
I know we kid him and stuff

12:10.100 --> 12:14.800
but when it comes right down to it, he's
one of the smartest people I know.

12:15.100 --> 12:18.000
One thing is certain.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.900
Someone is very dead.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.100
Well, Poirot, you've done it again.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.000
Look, can we just put that thing down
and call the police?

12:31.300 --> 12:33.200
No, no, no, hang on a minute, Niles.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.400
This skull's been underneath there
for a long time now.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
What's another hour gonna hurt?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.300
<i>Niles, we've got
a real Crane Boys Mystery here.</i>

12:40.600 --> 12:42.500
Why don't we see
if we can dig up a few more clues?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.300
All right, fair enough, uh, here.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.200
All right, so, what do we know?

12:50.500 --> 12:55.500
- We have a victim or part of one.
Correct.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.400
Can we establish motive?

12:57.700 --> 13:00.300
- Not without knowing the victim.
- Correct.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.800
Can we establish opportunity?

13:03.100 --> 13:04.700
- Whose opportunity?
- Whose indeed?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.700
It would have to be someone
who's had access

13:06.900 --> 13:08.100
to this house over the years.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.500
We can rule out Mom and Dad.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.200
Of course. What would you and I
be doing with a human skull?

13:12.400 --> 13:14.200
Oh, wait, Niles.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.300
Oh, dear God, we're idiots.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.300
Why are we idiots?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.000
Niles, use your brain.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.300
Think back to elementary school.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.300
I'm not following.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.000
Don't you remember?

13:31.300 --> 13:33.300
That was about the time when...

13:35.100 --> 13:38.200
Mrs. Lasskopf disappeared.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.300
Oh, my God, you're right.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.100
And, you know, they used to fight
all the time.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.000
Yes. And then suddenly
she stopped coming around.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.300
L... I always thought
that was because they split up.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.200
Did they?

13:51.600 --> 13:54.200
Or did he split her up?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.600
Cutting off her head and hands
so that the body couldn't be identified

14:00.800 --> 14:02.600
by dental records or fingerprints.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.800
I don't know, Frasier,
that's pretty out there.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.000
Although...

14:08.300 --> 14:10.600
It would explain why Lasskopf
didn't want us poking around

14:10.900 --> 14:12.000
under the floor.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.000
Frasier,
we have a victim and a suspect.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.700
All right, not so fast, Niles.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.000
Are you forgetting Item 1

14:18.200 --> 14:22.400
<i>from Top Truths for Teen Sleuths,
A Crane Boys Mysteries Workbook?</i>

14:22.700 --> 14:25.000
"A case is rarely elementary,

14:25.300 --> 14:29.500
- but always evidentiary. "
Yes, exactly.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.000
The only evidence we have
is the skull.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.200
Niles...

14:36.000 --> 14:37.800
Hand me those tools.

14:38.100 --> 14:42.400
Unless I miss my guess,
this floor isn't done talking.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.100
Niles, you'll never guess
what I just found in the...

14:50.500 --> 14:52.400
Niles, where are you?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.300
I'm here.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.900
I found our memory box

14:58.200 --> 15:03.200
and I think this rock could be
the murder weapon.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.500
Why that rock
instead of all the other rocks?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.600
It's pointier.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.800
Drop the rock, Niles.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.000
The garage has given up something
far more interesting.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
Take a look at this.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.600
Financial statements.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.100
Well, it appears the Lasskopfs
had quite a windfall.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.900
Yes, and it was just before the time
they asked us to leave.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.000
I see, I see. So he killed her,

15:32.300 --> 15:35.600
collected the insurance money,
and then evicted us

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
so he'd have a safe place
to dispose of the body.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.600
Bravo, Niles. But, no.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.900
Insurance is messy.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.000
They require a body
and a death certificate

15:45.200 --> 15:46.300
before they'll pay off.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
And messier still,
he would have had to kill her,

15:48.700 --> 15:53.300
conceal her body, get rid of us,
and then bring the body back here.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.000
If that's not insurance, then...

15:57.300 --> 15:59.700
- Inheritance.
- Exactly!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.800
Her parents die
and leave everything to her.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.100
Which means that now
the Lasskopfs want for nothing,

16:05.400 --> 16:07.600
but she's the provider.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.700
And never misses an opportunity
to remind him of it.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.200
- He's emasculated.
- Desperately.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.600
And so he hatches a plan.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.300
"Darling,
why don't we evict the Cranes?

16:26.600 --> 16:29.000
We don't need their rent money
anymore. "

16:29.300 --> 16:31.200
"No,
thanks to my family's frugal nature

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
and untimely death. "

16:33.800 --> 16:38.200
And so out go the Cranes
and the house is empty.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.400
"Darling,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.500
why don't we go and see
in what condition

16:44.700 --> 16:48.300
the Cranes have left the house?"
Hmm?

16:48.700 --> 16:51.900
"You go, you lazy parasite.
I'm having my nails done. "

16:54.500 --> 16:56.300
I mean, "Okay. "

16:57.700 --> 16:59.100
So...

17:00.000 --> 17:02.600
In they stroll.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.500
He with murderous intent,

17:05.800 --> 17:09.000
she with nary an inkling
of the tragedy about to befall her.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.800
He pretends to inspect the house.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.500
"Darling...

17:18.800 --> 17:21.900
Why what's this mark over here
on the wall?"

17:22.200 --> 17:23.599
- "Where?"
- "There.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.500
Look.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.800
Closer.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.900
Closer. "

17:30.100 --> 17:32.600
And as she leans in,
he does her in!

17:33.000 --> 17:36.100
"No, Alfred, no!"
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

17:36.300 --> 17:40.500
We have a victim. We have a motive.
And we have evidence for both.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.800
If only we had a murder weapon
to tie it together.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.600
<i>Niles, don't you remember?
As in many a Crane Boys case,</i>

17:45.900 --> 17:49.000
the absence of a weapon
does not mean the absence of a crime.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.800
Perhaps he pushed her
down the stairs

17:51.000 --> 17:53.800
<i>as in
The Case of the Unhappy Landing.</i>

17:55.100 --> 17:56.500
I thought the title gave it away.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.100
Hmm. Well, then we can rename it
once we have them published.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.500
- You think that would ever happen?
- Are you kidding?

18:03.800 --> 18:06.800
Once this hits the papers.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.600
I'm just gonna go down
and check on the laundry.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.600
If Alice wakes up,
keep an eye on her.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.700
- What happened to Roz?
- Alice's hamster died

18:18.900 --> 18:21.000
so Roz nipped out to the store
to get her a new one.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.400
Sure. No problem.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.500
Where's Mommy?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.900
Oh, hi, hon.
Your mom will be right back.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.700
Can we watch hockey?

18:36.900 --> 18:39.100
Uh, well, the game's over,
sweetheart.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.700
Canadiens won, by the way,
so you owe me ten bucks.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.500
I miss my hamster.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.100
I know you do, sweetheart.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.800
I'm sure he's up in hamster heaven
missing you too.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.000
What is hamster heaven?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.700
Well, that's where hamsters go
when they die.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.200
Mommy said he was lost.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.700
Oh. Oh. Oh, no.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.900
When will he come back?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.200
Oh, boy.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.900
Well, when a hamster goes
to hamster heaven, it can't come back.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.700
But that's okay.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.800
- Why?
- Oh, because it's great up there.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.900
They got exercise wheels
on every corner.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.400
And the streets are paved with...

19:30.200 --> 19:32.700
- What do hamsters eat?
- Hamster food.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.900
Ah, well, that's what the streets
are paved with.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.000
And there aren't any cats
to chase him.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.400
- Does cats have a heaven too?
- Oh, sure.

19:41.600 --> 19:46.700
Yeah, same deal, except no wheels
and their streets are paved with fish.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.700
- What about dogs?
- Yeah, dogs, too.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.600
Just about all animals
have a heaven.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.300
Is Eddie going?

19:54.400 --> 19:57.500
Oh, no, not... No, not Eddie.

19:57.900 --> 20:01.900
Not for a long time, anyway.
I mean, he's really still just a puppy.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.100
How old is he?

20:04.300 --> 20:05.800
He's about ten.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.900
That's not a puppy.

20:09.300 --> 20:13.800
Uh, hey, why don't we see
if there are any cartoons on TV?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.200
- Look who's here.
- Hey, everybody.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.800
Look, Alice.
Look what Mommy found.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.900
A new hamster.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
New?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.000
What makes you think he's new?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.300
Because animals don't come back
from heaven.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.900
- Right, Uncle Martin?
- Right.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.900
We sort of had a little talk.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
- You what?
- Well, look, I didn't mean...

20:33.800 --> 20:37.400
Having little talks with Alice
is my territory, not yours.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.500
Well, look, it was an accident.
Like I said, I'm sorry.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.700
Okay.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.600
But death is a tough concept
for a kid.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.000
I don't want her to be scared
or confused.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.500
I like this one better.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.600
Well, I guess she'll pull through.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.200
- Thanks for handling it.
- No problem.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.800
Come on, Alice.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.200
Good night, Martin.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.400
- Good night, Roz. Good night, Alice.
- Good night, Uncle Martin. Bye Eddie.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.100
Here, boy.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.700
Oh, my God.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.100
My house.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.600
- What have you done to my house?
- Is this the man you told me about?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.300
Yes, it is, officer.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.300
Well, what the hell's going on?

21:36.600 --> 21:40.100
We dug up your wife.
That's what's going on.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.800
You dug up my wife?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.500
I'll bet you thought nobody ever would,
didn't you?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.500
No!

21:48.800 --> 21:51.100
Well, you didn't count
on the Crane boys.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.200
But, how could you?

21:53.500 --> 21:56.800
Oh, a little luck
and some simple deductive reasoning.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.900
That's enough questions out of you.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.300
I think this officer here has a few
questions he'd like to ask you himself.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.900
That's right, sir.
Come this way, Mr. Lasskopf.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.000
- Nice work, men.
- Yeah.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.400
Well, Niles...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.300
Another Crane Boys Mystery solved.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.600
Wait till we tell Dad.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.500
Hey, wait, Niles.
We almost forgot our memory box.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.400
We never even looked inside here.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.700
- Oh, Niles, look.
- Oh.

22:29.900 --> 22:34.100
<i>This is the programme
for our backyard production of Hamlet.</i>

22:34.400 --> 22:38.200
- I'd totally forgotten about that.
- So had I.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.200
You know, Niles...

22:54.600 --> 22:58.200
We may owe Mr. Lasskopf
an apology.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.100
<i>Let's go.</i>
