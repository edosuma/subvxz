WEBVTT

00:17.585 --> 00:18.552
Hello?

00:24.325 --> 00:26.194
Hello?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.568
Where you are going,
new pool boy?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.470
Please don't kill me.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.406
I just have to go
to the bathroom,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.308
and the toilet
in our home is broken.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.443
Why you not just say so, mon?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.778
'Cause you were waving that
skinny sword in my face.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.480
And I know that the clients
sometimes don't like

00:46.514 --> 00:47.781
the outside help
to use inside stuff.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.819
Is that Sabrina?

00:51.852 --> 00:53.554
(chuckles)

00:53.587 --> 00:56.090
Oh, my God.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.825
Is this guy sleeping
with this girl?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.527
I hope not--
that's his daughter.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.848
* Whoo

01:20.881 --> 01:25.319
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. *

01:30.358 --> 01:34.362
Oh, this apple
tastes like plastic.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.264
It i plastic, Maw Maw!

01:36.297 --> 01:38.766
Oh!
That's one
of Hope's toys.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.835
Is it too much to ask the kid to
keep her toy food off the floor?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.537
How am I supposed
to tell

01:43.571 --> 01:45.539
what's real food
and what's fake?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.508
How about you just
don't eat food

01:47.541 --> 01:48.709
off the floor?

01:48.742 --> 01:51.111
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.283
Hey, check this out.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.418
I picked this up
from my new rich client.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.153
That's her father.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.688
Sabrina's rich.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.524
That must be why she knows
so much about cheese.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.926
JIMMY:
Hey!

02:05.959 --> 02:07.528
Sabrina is gonna join us
for dinner.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.862
You guys ordered enough pizza,
right?

02:08.896 --> 02:10.298
Oh, yeah, tons.
That'll be great.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.465
Oh, yeah, sounds
great. Fun.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.600
What's this?

02:12.633 --> 02:13.601
Our toilet's broken.
For a while

02:13.634 --> 02:14.935
we thought it was
low-flow,

02:14.968 --> 02:16.670
but then it turned
out to be no-flow.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.739
Oh, well, I'm happy
to kick in what I can.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.877
(Hope fussing)
Oh, I'll go get her.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.950
Jimmy, look at this picture.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.485
Whoa.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.853
Where'd you get that?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.121
Her dad's a new client.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.224
He owns the kind of house Jean-
Claude Van Damme would live in.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.558
She's filthy rich.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.793
She's just pretending
to be lower, lower, lower

02:39.827 --> 02:41.229
middle class just like us.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.732
Hey, what if she's
a rich actress

02:44.765 --> 02:47.268
and she's doing research on
how to play a poor person?

02:47.301 --> 02:50.871
Nah, she's too short
to be an actress.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.574
Look, whatever her reasons are,
we should just respect them.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.444
If we ask, it'll just make
things uncomfortable and weird.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.945
What's weird?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.248
Al Yankovic.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.815
(doorbell rings)
Pizza's here.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.660
SABRINA:
Hey, aren't you my gas man?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.495
During the day I am.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.297
I got 14 kids.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.432
Oh, bingo!
Found another quarter.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.833
Where are we, Tyler?

03:19.867 --> 03:23.304
That puts you up
to ten dollars and 18 cents,

03:23.337 --> 03:24.938
so you still need $2.68.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.640
That's excluding tip,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.576
which I assume you will be.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.811
It's too bad we don't
have a credit card.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.647
This would be a good time for
one of us to have a credit card.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.788
How much do we save
if we lose the sausage?

03:40.821 --> 03:41.755
Buck and a half.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.227
Lose the sausage.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.265
Getting your sausage
repossessed. Whew.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.934
I bet rich people never have
to feel that sting.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.970
You should just take some money
out of your new toilet jar.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.578
You're saying we should take
the money we're saving

04:04.612 --> 04:07.281
for a new toilet
and spend it on pizza?

04:07.315 --> 04:08.982
Yeah, okay.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.584
I guess
we could do that.

04:10.618 --> 04:14.455
Or, and this is just
a suggestion, but maybe

04:14.488 --> 04:16.624
you could pay for it
since you're rich.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.959
That's right, we
know you're rich.

04:18.992 --> 04:23.664
I bet you could use your fancy
gold credit card with a limit

04:23.697 --> 04:27.701
of a thousand dollars and buy
all the pizzas in Natesville!

04:37.978 --> 04:39.680
You were right.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.549
This is uncomfortable
and weird.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.356
Okay, first of all,
I do not have money.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.690
My family does.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.725
What happened,
did Daddy cut you off?

04:51.759 --> 04:52.626
Were you doing heroin?

04:53.927 --> 04:56.096
What? We don't know
how deep this lie goes.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.866
I cut myself off.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.535
I'd would rather live like crap
on money that I earned myself

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
than live like a princess
on money

05:03.404 --> 05:05.105
that somebody else gave me.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.641
(both laughing)

05:09.443 --> 05:11.078
That is the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.613
Money you don't
have to work for

05:12.646 --> 05:14.047
is the best kind.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.016
It's like getting paid
for not having a job.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.751
It's the best kind of job
not to have.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.787
Well, that explains why
we've never met your family.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.555
You're embarrassed by us.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.758
No, no! If anything, I'm
embarrassed of my family.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.561
You really expect us to believe
that you're more embarrassed

05:27.595 --> 05:28.962
of your family
than you are by us?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.831
We don't have a pot to pee in.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.700
Actually, I do.
It's in the garage.

05:32.733 --> 05:36.036
Okay, we have one pot
to pee in. Either way...

05:36.069 --> 05:38.038
I have two. The other one's
in the truck.
See what I mean?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.573
There's no way you
cannot be embarrassed by us.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.376
Fine. If you think I'm hiding
you from my family,

05:42.410 --> 05:44.044
I will take you to meet
my father tomorrow.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.713
Deal.
No time for dry cleaning.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.415
Get your church clothes
and the Febreze

05:47.448 --> 05:48.549
and meet me in the backyard.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.554
(gunshot)

05:55.055 --> 05:57.425
Pull!

05:57.458 --> 05:58.959
(chuckles)

05:58.992 --> 06:00.093
(Sabrina clears her throat)

06:00.127 --> 06:02.162
Sabrina!
Hey, baby.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.567
Daddy, this is my friend, Jimmy,
and his daughter, Hope,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.001
and his parents,
Burt and Virginia.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.670
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
Cap Collins.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.505
How are you? Hi.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
Daddy, are you shooting
Mom's favorite china again?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.676
She's traveling the world
with half my money.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.611
I should at least get to do
something fun, huh?

06:17.645 --> 06:18.812
(chuckles)

06:18.846 --> 06:21.114
Mackenzie, gravy boat.
Pull!

06:23.684 --> 06:25.786
Bitch loved her gravy.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.523
Here, honey, break this
for me, would you?

06:29.557 --> 06:30.591
There you go.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.726
This is quite a house.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.861
$6.3 million.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.496
Nobody asked how much it cost.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.930
It's impolite
to talk about money.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.099
No, baby, it's impolite to ask
about money.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.668
That's why I tell people,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.603
so they won't be impolite
by asking, huh?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.839
You know what would be fun?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.541
Shooting this china with
the gun that killed Lincoln.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.542
I'll be right back.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.910
Excuse me.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.111
You see?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.513
He's embarrassing.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.147
All he wants
to talk about is money.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.149
I'd talk about money, too,
if I had as much as he does.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.651
Me, too.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.719
I'd take it out,
I'd wave it around,

06:58.752 --> 06:59.687
I'd staple it
to my forehead--

06:59.720 --> 07:00.654
whatever's fun.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.722
(laughter)

07:01.755 --> 07:02.990
Lobster?

07:03.023 --> 07:04.024
Thank you.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.997
Never had lobster before.

07:10.030 --> 07:10.931
Mmm.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.735
I found my new favorite food.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.003
Sayonara, Chipwich.

07:16.036 --> 07:16.937
Mmm.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.138
You got a little bit
of sauce on your shirt.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.207
Oh, stink.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.809
Oh, oh, no,
you know what?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.110
We got a bathroom if you
want to just go ahead

07:23.143 --> 07:24.812
and rinse that off.
Oh, no,
I'm just getting

07:24.845 --> 07:25.913
the taste out.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.148
Lobster doesn't grow on trees.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.550
I think.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.919
Who knows what goes on
under the sea?

07:33.687 --> 07:35.556
I'll help you.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.029
I'll be right back.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.997
Okay.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.081
(gasps)

08:09.122 --> 08:10.624
Sabrina...
(clears throat)

08:10.658 --> 08:12.125
don't forget your sister's
party is Saturday.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.696
Here, please buy
something nice to wear.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.064
You should come,
too, Jimmy.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.666
Bring Hope.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.067
Sabrina's sister, Susan, has
a daughter about the same age.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.536
I'm sure they'll hit it off.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.671
Sounds great,
thank you.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
Ah, why are you
so reluctant

08:28.008 --> 08:29.743
to let me show you
that I love you?

08:29.777 --> 08:32.079
(sighs)

08:32.112 --> 08:32.880
We are not going

08:32.913 --> 08:34.281
to that party, Jimmy.
Oh, come on.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.183
It'll be fun, and besides,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.619
I like the idea of Hope
having wealthy friends.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.187
She'll get
all their old clothes

08:40.220 --> 08:42.022
and she'll learn about
the stuff rich people do,

08:42.055 --> 08:45.192
like yachting and how
valet parking works.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.827
Please don't guilt
me into this.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.062
All my snobby high school
friends are going to be there.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.798
Look, maybe you hate
being around rich people,

08:50.831 --> 08:53.066
but I deserve the chance
to learn to hate them, too,

08:53.100 --> 08:53.867
and so does Hope.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.705
This is so warm.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.773
You could cook on this.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.342
And it shoots water up
for cleaning.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.579
Cleaning what?

09:05.613 --> 09:07.715
Oh.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.116
But then don't
you get all...?

09:09.149 --> 09:10.618
(air blowing)

09:10.651 --> 09:12.653
Oh!

09:14.221 --> 09:15.589
(laughing)

09:15.623 --> 09:17.090
(air stops blowing)

09:17.124 --> 09:18.892
Yeah, I got that in Japan--
the toilet of the future.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.596
That thing is so comfortable,
I started to pee sitting down.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.765
Our old toilet made me want
to pee standing up.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.868
Well, this cost $2,000.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.069
Well, we're in the market
for a new toilet,

09:29.102 --> 09:30.804
but our cars don't cost
that much.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.640
Our cars don't smell
this good either.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.607
What is that?

09:33.641 --> 09:34.775
Jasmine.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.376
Has an air freshener.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.078
Ah.
(sniffs)

09:38.111 --> 09:39.246
Ah.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.114
Those Japanese know
how to live.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.282
Mmm.
(sniffs)

09:45.385 --> 09:48.155
Remember, rich people don't
like to hear the word no,

09:48.188 --> 09:49.623
and since that's the
only word you know,

09:49.657 --> 09:50.991
best just keep
it zipped.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.726
VIRGINIA:
And FYI, when you
hide behind a piece

09:52.760 --> 09:54.027
of furniture,
people know you're pooping.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.295
(gibbering)

09:55.328 --> 09:56.964
Guys, easy.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.965
She doesn't understand
what you're saying.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.032
Yes, she does,
she's at that age

09:59.066 --> 10:00.701
where she understands
everything.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.235
Her tongue hasn't grown
into her head yet.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.204
That's why she
can't talk so good.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.706
She'll be fine.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.207
It's me I'm worried about.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.009
How do I look?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.111
Well, I wouldn't say
you're classically handsome,

10:11.144 --> 10:14.414
but you're kind of attractive
in an offbeat kind of way.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.117
I meant the clothes.
They're fine,
but don't do anything stupid.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.720
If they serve filet "miggnon,"
then don't ask for ketchup;

10:19.753 --> 10:21.321
ask for steak sauce.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.791
This party could be all of our
tickets to champagne wishes

10:23.824 --> 10:25.759
and caviar dreams.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.160
(cooing)

10:27.194 --> 10:29.429
(doorbell rings)

10:29.462 --> 10:31.298
VIRGINIA:
"Dear Virginia and Burt,

10:31.331 --> 10:34.802
"please accept this
toilet as a gift.

10:34.835 --> 10:38.438
"It was flown business class
all the way from Japan.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.075
"I'm told sitting next to
it, was Mr. Barry Bonds.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.177
Enjoy,
Cap Collins."

10:44.211 --> 10:48.215
Who gives someone
a $2,000 toilet as a gift?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.183
Rich people, that's who.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.752
Do not screw this up.

10:51.785 --> 10:52.853
You understand me, don't you?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.891
She understands me.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.300
Sissy!

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
I am so glad you made it.
Ooh....

11:09.369 --> 11:11.371
It's gonna
be so much fun.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.907
Yeah, it's very nice of you to
let Daddy throw you this party.

11:13.941 --> 11:17.845
It gives him a chance
to hit on all our friends.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.047
Here's a riddle for you, baby:
what has two thumbs,

11:20.080 --> 11:21.749
a net worth of almost
$20 million,

11:21.782 --> 11:23.416
and wants to have sex with you?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.252
This guy, right here.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.486
(Cap and woman laughing)

11:26.519 --> 11:30.791
And who is this cutie?
This is Hope.

11:30.824 --> 11:34.227
It just so happens I have a
little girl about the same age

11:34.261 --> 11:37.130
in the family room
watching Yo Gabba Gabba.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.466
Oh, that's great. Yo Gabba Gabba
is Hope's favorite show.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.835
* Ah...

11:41.869 --> 11:44.905
* We gotta jump, shake,
shimmy them out... *

11:44.938 --> 11:47.474
Those are the real
Yo Gabba Gabba guys.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.877
We don't allow
Madison to watch TV,

11:49.910 --> 11:52.946
but Daddy gave a million dollars
to Muno's favorite charity,

11:52.980 --> 11:54.281
so they stop by
once in a while.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.949
* Let's get the sillies out...

11:58.218 --> 12:02.289
Honey. I got a surprise for you.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.892
It's breakfast for dinner.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.795
A sausage log cabin
with a waffle roof.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.063
MAW MAW:
I want my old toilet back.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.199
VIRGINIA:
This one is better.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.967
Burt, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to get Maw Maw

12:14.001 --> 12:15.268
to try the new toilet.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.104
Wrap mine up.
I'll eat it in the morning.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.106
No, Maw Maw, you cannot
go in the tub.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.808
MAW MAW:
I can't hold it any longer!

12:20.841 --> 12:22.475
VIRGINIA:
Then get on the new toilet!

12:24.577 --> 12:26.346
But if you eat it in the morning

12:26.379 --> 12:27.781
it won't be
breakfast for dinner.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.382
MAW MAW:
Stop pushing me!

12:29.416 --> 12:30.250
It'll be
leftover-breakfast-for-dinner

12:30.283 --> 12:31.551
for breakfast.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.953
That's not special.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.487
You can't make me...

12:34.521 --> 12:35.555
Oh...

12:35.588 --> 12:37.524
It's glorious.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.793
So warm.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.996
Permission to increase my fiber.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.332
See? Isn't it nice?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.835
You wouldn't believe
this guy's house.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.502
And get this, he
served us lobster.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.538
MAW MAW:
Fancy.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.107
VIRGINIA:
And it's not like he knew
we were coming over, either.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.043
He just had lobster,
ready to eat.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.978
On a Thursday.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.019
My wife developed a taste
for the good life.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.388
I need the biggest lobster
this toilet money can buy.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.093
Sorry, Mr. Pinchers,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.362
but my marriage is on the line.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.164
Don't worry, though,
it's going to be a fair fight.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.932
I'll boil the water,

13:18.966 --> 13:20.267
I'll take those rubber bands
off your claws,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.269
and whoever winds up in the pot,
winds up in the pot.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.470
So, Jimmy,
what do you think about

13:23.503 --> 13:24.537
the current
economic situation?

13:26.406 --> 13:31.278
Oh, uh, don't get me started
on that economic situation.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.946
(all laugh politely)

13:32.980 --> 13:34.848
I'm just worried about
what's going on in Greece.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.249
I mean, it's gonna
affect the Euro.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.985
I think it's pronounced gyro.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.187
No?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.022
(laughing)
So funny.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.292
Where is Sabrina?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.196
Come on, Virginia. You going
to stay in there all night?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.898
VIRGINIA:
I'm not going to the bathroom.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.199
It's just so comfortable
I'm sitting here

13:52.232 --> 13:53.166
while I paint my nails.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.939
Oh, stupid baby.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.441
Left one of her food toys
in the kitchen again.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.181
Just come to the kitchen
and eat something.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.051
Think of it as an investment
for more time in there later.

14:11.084 --> 14:11.952
VIRGINIA:
Be out in a second.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.287
One more toenail,
one more lady-rinse,

14:14.321 --> 14:16.189
and I'll be good to go.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.463
(ominous music begins)

14:29.102 --> 14:31.338
(chomping sound)
VIRGINIA: Ow!

14:31.371 --> 14:34.374
Damn it, Mr. Pinchers.
Not cool.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.276
(crickets chirping)

14:36.309 --> 14:38.378
Nice going, Pinchers.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.579
Uh, don't give me that look.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.248
You know what you did.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.682
It's not his fault.
You're the one

14:42.715 --> 14:45.218
that brought a ferocious
sea creature into the house.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.120
Since when do we pay
a hundred dollars

14:47.154 --> 14:48.956
for food that can bite back?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.558
Since you had lobster
on a Thursday at Cap's house!

14:51.591 --> 14:53.393
Now suddenly
you're some society lady

14:53.426 --> 14:55.395
spending all day sitting
on a luxury crapper!

14:55.428 --> 14:57.497
Burt...

14:57.530 --> 15:00.367
are you jealous of the toilet?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.235
Of course I am!
You love it!

15:02.269 --> 15:05.138
But not as much as I love you.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.475
I mean... just 'cause it can
detect a urinary tract infection

15:08.508 --> 15:10.243
and e-mail your doctor...

15:10.277 --> 15:11.444
You know what?
Sabrina was right.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.146
It's better to crap
on something you earned

15:13.180 --> 15:15.015
than to feel crappy on something
you didn't work for.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.317
Fine, fine!
We'll just sell it.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.352
That's still no good--
we'll just end up buying

15:19.386 --> 15:21.288
a bunch of other stuff
that I can't afford,

15:21.321 --> 15:22.655
like more stupid lobsters!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.291
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

15:24.324 --> 15:26.293
You and ten of your cousins
running around here,

15:26.326 --> 15:27.460
pinching everybody,
ruining everything!

15:29.462 --> 15:31.131
(soft groan)

15:31.164 --> 15:33.500
I'm sorry, Mr. Pinchers,
I'm not mad at you.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.135
You're just being a lobster.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.076
Hey, where you been?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.078
I need help talking
to rich people.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.147
Oh, God, see?
I told you they're all jerks.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.382
No, they've been completely
friendly and nice.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.485
At least I think.
I only get about 10%
of what they say,

15:52.519 --> 15:54.988
and that's only because
somehow peanut butter came up.
No,

15:55.022 --> 15:56.156
Jimmy, I don't want to.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.125
Come on, do it for Hope.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.427
Eh.
(exhales)

16:00.460 --> 16:03.030
But we can't wait to do
Thanksgiving in Tahoe.
Oh!

16:03.063 --> 16:05.365
It's gonna be so much fun
to teach the kids how to ski.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.634
Well, I can't wait to
watch your kids grow up

16:07.667 --> 16:10.137
to enjoy snow as much
as you have, Derek.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.406
(snorting)

16:13.440 --> 16:15.375
That must be so great driving
around in that convertible

16:15.408 --> 16:18.211
pretending like you have
a grown-up-sized penis.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.414
Your doctor did a very good job
fixing that deviated septum.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.550
Glad he decided to do more
work while he was at it.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.053
Boom! Boom! Bam!

16:26.086 --> 16:27.420
Badonkadonk!

16:27.454 --> 16:31.024
Hey, what the hell was all that?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.225
Oh, I know, right?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.760
I told you they were jerks.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.628
They were just talking
about their lives.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.298
You were acting
like a huge jerk.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.501
That poor guy, he had no
idea his wife wore a toupee.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.436
Jimmy, this is just like
high school.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.506
I just had listen to them brag
about their straight A's

16:46.539 --> 16:48.541
and their state champion
tennis teams

16:48.575 --> 16:50.577
and, you know,
who got in to what college.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.045
It's, like, who cares?

16:52.079 --> 16:53.613
Sounds like you do.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.515
You're insecure.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.250
Insecure?

16:57.284 --> 16:59.652
(laughs)
What, about them?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.155
Yes! I mean, that's
why you lashed out.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.690
It's like when
my dad is

17:03.723 --> 17:06.093
in an argument and he knows
he's about to lose--

17:06.126 --> 17:07.327
he panics and
he punches you.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.062
Jimmy, this is
completely different.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.630
No, it's not-- it's
exactly like that.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.165
Just shut up!
Aah!

17:12.199 --> 17:13.300
Aah...

17:13.333 --> 17:16.469
Eh? (mumbles)

17:18.205 --> 17:19.839
Oh, my God.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.075
(exhales)

17:22.109 --> 17:23.443
You're right.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.677
(wry laugh)

17:24.711 --> 17:26.679
It's, like, I get here,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.416
and all I see are their-their...

17:29.449 --> 17:32.185
their great jobs and...
and their babies

17:32.219 --> 17:35.155
and... how much shorter I am
than everybody else.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.556
You don't seem
that much shorter.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.425
Jimmy, I'm wearing
five-inch heels.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.828
I thought you looked
suspiciously normal-
sized today.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.564
Do you know what it's like to be
the only one of your friends

17:44.597 --> 17:46.266
whose legs are too stubby
to jump far enough

17:46.299 --> 17:47.634
to stick to the Velcro wall?

17:47.667 --> 17:51.504
No. I run more with
the Velcro wallet crowd.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.706
Well, why does it
freak me out so much

17:53.740 --> 17:55.608
just because
somebody's better than me?

17:55.642 --> 17:58.811
I mean, other people
don't act that way.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.414
At work,
people don't lash out at me.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.550
Yeah, yeah. Wait.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.751
Wh-What?
Like, Frank

18:04.784 --> 18:06.486
doesn't lash out
at me, you know?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.620
Shelley doesn't
lash out at me.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.322
Barney doesn't
lash out at me.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.425
Hold on, why would
they lash out at you?

18:12.459 --> 18:14.427
I-I don't know,
it's just...
Oh, my God,

18:14.461 --> 18:16.396
you think you're
better than them.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.166
That's-that's...
not what I'm s...

18:19.199 --> 18:21.901
Okay, the thing is,
is that what...

18:21.934 --> 18:23.803
Oh, come on, you got to give me
Frank; I'm better than Frank.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.372
No, you're not.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.574
You're smarter
and less creepy than Frank,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.843
but Frank is better at...
not feeling superior to people.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.812
And so is Barney
and Shelley and...

18:32.845 --> 18:34.281
Okay, fine, Jimmy, fine!

18:34.314 --> 18:35.682
Then everybody's
just better than me!

18:35.715 --> 18:38.218
Thank you very much
for pointing that out.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.527
Hey.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.728
Listen...

18:50.763 --> 18:54.734
Uh... everybody you meet
is gonna be better than
you at some stuff

18:54.767 --> 18:57.370
and worse than you
at other stuff.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.308
I'm sure everyone here
is way better than me
at making money.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.509
(chuckles):
You know?

19:02.542 --> 19:05.445
But I checked on my kid
ten times more

19:05.478 --> 19:10.350
than they have tonight,
and so I'm probably
a better parent.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.652
But if you spend
your entire life

19:12.685 --> 19:15.522
comparing yourself
to everyone you meet,

19:15.555 --> 19:18.458
you're gonna drive
yourself crazy.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.560
(exhales, chuckles)

19:20.593 --> 19:22.495
I think I already did.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.366
Thank you.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.770
(exhales)

19:32.639 --> 19:35.242
You're welcome.

19:35.275 --> 19:39.246
* There will always
be someone better than you *

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
*

19:41.281 --> 19:43.516
* Even if you're the best
I'm sorry.

19:46.253 --> 19:49.522
* So let's stop
the competition now *

19:50.957 --> 19:52.659
* Or we will both

19:52.692 --> 19:54.894
* Be losers
Hey, guys.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.696
*

19:56.729 --> 19:59.799
* I don't want to be laid down

20:01.768 --> 20:04.537
* No, I don't want
to die knowing *

20:06.406 --> 20:09.942
* That I spent so much time
when I was young *

20:11.444 --> 20:15.748
* Just trying to be the winner

20:15.782 --> 20:19.386
* Don't care
about being a winner *

20:19.419 --> 20:22.955
* Or being smooth with women

20:22.989 --> 20:26.593
* Or going out on Fridays

20:26.626 --> 20:30.029
* Being the life of parties

20:30.062 --> 20:33.733
* Don't care
about being harder *

20:33.766 --> 20:37.437
* Or being Daddy's favorite

20:37.470 --> 20:40.673
* Or if you think I'm a mimic

20:40.707 --> 20:44.511
* Or if I am a loser

20:44.544 --> 20:47.947
* Don't care
about being a winner *

20:47.980 --> 20:51.584
* Or being smooth with women

20:51.618 --> 20:55.021
* Or going out on Fridays

20:55.054 --> 20:58.758
* Being the life of parties

20:58.791 --> 21:02.429
* Don't care
about being harder *

21:02.462 --> 21:05.665
* Or being Daddy's favorite

21:05.698 --> 21:09.536
* Or if you think I'm a mimic

21:09.569 --> 21:11.604
* Or if I am a loser

21:11.638 --> 21:13.606
* No...

21:13.640 --> 21:16.343
* No more

21:16.376 --> 21:17.877
*

21:20.913 --> 21:23.049
* No more

21:25.051 --> 21:26.319
One...

21:26.353 --> 21:27.920
* No more.
two...

21:27.954 --> 21:28.921
three!

21:28.955 --> 21:31.324
Yeah!

21:31.358 --> 21:35.595
(Sabrina screaming happily,
crowd cheering, whooping)

21:35.628 --> 21:37.464
Child: Funny stuff.
