MIKOTO ELEMENTARY

01:25.210 --> 01:26.628
All right, good morning.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.674
Okay, take your seats.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.054
It's Monday.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.557
Looks like Kayo's late again.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.232
What's wrong, Satoru?
Take your seat.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.363
All right, I'm taking attendance.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.491
-Tokiko Asano.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.201

-Here.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.836
<i>Is this a Revival?</i>

02:07.919 --> 02:09.128
-Tsutomu Sakai.
-Here.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.005
<i>This is 18 years ago.</i>

02:11.089 --> 02:12.590
-Hiromi Sugita.

FEBRUARY 15TH CLASS ATTENDANTS:
KENYA KOBAYASHI MANAMI KUMAGAI

02:25.186 --> 02:26.688
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:30.150
<i>Why would a Revival</i>
<i>take me back this far?</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:34.904
<i>Wait. That reminds me.</i>

02:35.405 --> 02:36.739
<i>What about Mom?</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:39.534
Satoru. What's up?

02:45.039 --> 02:46.040
Nurse's office.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.918
My head is hurting a little.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
Mom! Mom!

03:24.078 --> 03:24.913
Mom!

03:25.413 --> 03:26.247
Mom! Mom!

03:28.291 --> 03:29.125
Mom! Mom!

03:31.377 --> 03:32.378
Mom!

06:23.466 --> 06:24.342
Mom.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.595
Did I wake you?

06:30.139 --> 06:31.641
Hamburger or meatballs?

06:31.891 --> 06:32.975
Which do you want?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.312
Hamburger.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.939
Okay.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.810
<i>This is happiness.</i>

07:18.146 --> 07:19.230
It's really good.

07:24.694 --> 07:29.949
This morning... we got in a big fight
because you couldn't find your flute.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.244
And now it's like you don't remember.

07:35.121 --> 07:35.955
I'm... Sorry.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.127
You don't have to cry about it!

07:44.088 --> 07:44.922
Mom.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.592
It's really good. Thank you.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.596
What's gotten into you?

07:53.139 --> 07:53.973
It's nothing.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.686
<i>The simple times.</i>

07:59.979 --> 08:01.564
<i>That came and went.</i>

08:03.232 --> 08:05.067
<i>The time I lost.</i>

08:07.069 --> 08:08.029
<i>No way...</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:11.824
<i>will I lose these moments this time.</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:31.219
<i>Does this mean starting over</i>
<i>from 18 years ago</i>

08:31.302 --> 08:33.346
<i>is the way to save Mom?</i>

08:36.807 --> 08:37.642
<i>But why?</i> <i>Oh, right.</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:54.825
<i>This is before Kayo Hinazuki</i>
<i>is kidnapped and murdered.</i>

08:57.912 --> 09:00.581
Which means since this angle
is 70 degrees...

09:00.665 --> 09:01.499
FEBRUARY 16TH
TUESDAY

09:01.582 --> 09:06.254
...you take 180 degrees minus 70 degrees

09:06.629 --> 09:08.464
which equals 110 degrees.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.675
Now that leaves these two angles.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.845
Since this is an isosceles triangle,
what should we do?

09:14.929 --> 09:18.224
<i>Does this Revival mean</i>
<i>I'm supposed to prevent her murder?</i>

09:18.307 --> 09:21.310
-I think you should divide it by two.
-Good. Correct.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.563
<i>But...</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:26.482
<i>I mostly don't know anything about</i>
<i>Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

09:27.316 --> 09:29.986
<i>Not even the exact date of the crime.</i>

09:30.069 --> 09:31.404
Fifty-five degrees.

09:31.821 --> 09:35.324
And that is how you find the angles
of an isosceles triangle.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.744
Now, this is definitely going to be
on the test.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.997
<i>-Those bruises...</i>
-So, practice them.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.626
<i>-Wait, could it be...?</i>
-How about we try solving question five.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.214
By the way, Satoru...

09:51.173 --> 09:53.134
do you like Hinazuki or something?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.970
You were staring at her all period.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.347
-Really?
-So, that's the deal?

09:58.431 --> 10:02.310
All right, leave it to me.
I can help you talk to Hinazuki!

10:02.768 --> 10:04.478
Hold on a second. Look...

10:06.147 --> 10:08.983
<i>That's right, Hiromi gets taken</i>
<i>after Hinazuki...</i>

10:09.066 --> 10:09.900
HIROMI SUGITA (11)
KAYO HINAZUKI (10)

10:09.984 --> 10:13.321
-So, what is it, then?
-What is it?

10:13.904 --> 10:15.823
<i>All right. I made up my mind.</i>

10:15.906 --> 10:17.283
<i>I'll take this case on.</i>

10:19.452 --> 10:22.496
I don't know if I like her,
but she's been on my mind.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.000
That means that you like her!

10:26.083 --> 10:28.169
-No!
-It means you like her!

10:28.252 --> 10:31.547
-Stop saying it!
-I'll hook you up! We're counting on you!

10:36.218 --> 10:37.053
You stupid?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.473
That's the first thing you say?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
<i>Oh, I said that aloud...</i>

10:44.018 --> 10:44.852
Look.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.980
I was wondering if we could be friends.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.487
What exactly about me
made you to say this?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.073
That's...

11:01.202 --> 11:03.954
But... I guess I kind of get it.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.918
You know.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.296
Because you're fake like me.

11:16.342 --> 11:20.012
I saw you running home yesterday.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.351
Is your mother really that important?

11:30.815 --> 11:31.649
Yeah.

11:35.945 --> 11:36.946
I see.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.282
Wait, hold on, I wasn't done!

11:40.741 --> 11:43.202
I want to be friends with you.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.748
Friends?

11:57.341 --> 12:01.178
Then... can you murder
someone for me?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.130
Satoru. How did it go?

12:37.965 --> 12:42.720
Yeah. I feel like I got her to open up
to me just a little bit.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.430
I see.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.475
Satoru...

12:48.601 --> 12:53.689
I think what you're doing with Hinazuki
is really important for some reason.

12:55.399 --> 13:00.571
I'm sure everyone would want to help you.
So, you can come to me with anything.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.990
Okay. Thanks, Kenya.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.242
By the way, Satoru,

13:06.035 --> 13:07.995
have you read through the essays?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.583
They're really interesting.
You should read them.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.587
Essays?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.651
"A City Where Only I Am Gone

than I am now,

13:50.871 --> 13:53.165
I want to go to some faraway country.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.626
A faraway island."

13:57.878 --> 13:58.796
<i>An island</i>

13:59.755 --> 14:02.132
<i>without any sadness or suffering.</i>

<i>classmates,</i>

14:27.825 --> 14:30.619
<i>This essay is without a doubt</i>

14:31.036 --> 14:33.080
<i>a cry for help from Kayo Hinazuki.</i>

14:43.883 --> 14:44.967
Hinazuki.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.098
What are you doing here?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.559
That's my line.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.853
I said I wanted to be friends.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.397
Fujinuma.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.903
You just pretend, don't you?
You pretend to laugh.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.030
Pretend to be nice.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.283
I can't see your true face.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.829
I think you're right.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.041
I'm just pretending.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.835
I want people to like me.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.087
I want friends.

15:23.589 --> 15:27.468
Not being that good with people,
I thought of what I could do.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.221
So, I decided to try to like other people.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.558
Then pretending became easier to do.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.314
Yeah. Me, too.

15:41.482 --> 15:45.069
As you pretend,
it starts to feel like it is real.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.198
<i>People do all sorts of things</i>
<i>to encourage themselves</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:51.116
<i>to get what they want.</i>

15:51.784 --> 15:55.245
<i>So... I'm going to do</i>
<i>the things I never did.</i>

15:59.375 --> 16:00.459
Hey, Hinazuki.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.213
I'm having a birthday party.
Would you come?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.934
BIRTHDAY INVITATION

16:17.685 --> 16:19.019
You want me to come?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.815
Aren't others going?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.274
I don't know yet.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.820
I wanted you to be the first one
I invited.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.951
It's March 2nd.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.538
You'll come, won't you?

16:42.876 --> 16:43.711
Fujinuma...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.547
aren't your hands cold?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.550
Oh, guess I left my gloves somewhere.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.683
Looks like my hand's a little bigger.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.020
You stupid? But...

17:09.153 --> 17:12.448
you're a little easier
to talk to right now.

17:13.949 --> 17:18.037
Yeah. Well, I decided
I wouldn't lie to you.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.960
Bye! See you tomorrow!

17:40.059 --> 17:42.811
<i>This is the last place</i>
<i>Hinazuki was ever seen.</i>

17:46.356 --> 17:48.025
<i>So, when did she go missing?</i>

17:49.651 --> 17:53.030
<i>The first kidnapping was in March.</i>

17:53.238 --> 17:56.575
<i>Wait, everyone should turn 11</i>
<i>in fifth grade.</i>

17:56.658 --> 17:57.951
KAYO HINAZUKI (10)

18:00.662 --> 18:01.497
That's it.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.958
Hinazuki's birthday must be in March.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.170
And she was killed before her birthday.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.550
<i>Once I know her birthday, I might be able</i>
<i>to narrow down the day she's taken.</i>

18:19.723 --> 18:22.726
Hey, did you guys study?
There's a test today!

18:22.810 --> 18:24.478
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.437
FEBRUARY 20TH
SATURDAY

18:29.691 --> 18:30.526
Did you know?

18:30.609 --> 18:31.944
Totally!

18:33.487 --> 18:34.613
Hey, Hinazuki.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.408
I know this is random,
but when's your birthday?

18:38.909 --> 18:40.410
Hey, everyone!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.497
Fujinuma and Hinazuki
are totally flirting!

18:49.336 --> 18:53.507
-I'm so jealous.
-Must be nice.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.595
<i>I messed up.</i>
<i>I should've picked a better spot.</i>

19:00.180 --> 19:03.350
<i>But I want to find out</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

19:06.478 --> 19:07.563
Excuse me.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.154
Mr. Yashiro.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.239
Oh, what's up, Satoru?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.660
-There's something I'd like to ask.
-All right. What is it?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.581
-Is it about Kayo?
-What?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.625
I've noticed you hanging out lately.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.628
<i>Mr. Yashiro really pays attention.</i>

19:31.920 --> 19:34.756
Yeah.
I wanted to know her birthday.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.217
Birthday? You didn't ask her?

19:37.926 --> 19:40.554
I did... but she wouldn't tell me.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.018
You know, Kayo's very reserved.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.147
I think she really could benefit
from having more friends.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.858
So, I'll do this just this once.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.528
CLASS ATTENDANCE BOOK

19:56.612 --> 19:57.738

19:58.488 --> 19:59.531
Here you go.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.453
March 2nd.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.705
Same as me?

20:06.788 --> 20:11.293
<i>Now I know when the kidnapping happened.</i>
<i>March 1st.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:14.171
<i>That's Day X.</i>

20:14.755 --> 20:18.425
The same birthday.
Maybe she felt awkward telling you, then.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.054
-You should just celebrate it with her.
-Yeah.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.807
Satoru, it's all about giving it your all.

20:26.433 --> 20:27.851
Good luck with Kayo.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.895
You can come talk to me anytime.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.273
Thank you, Mr. Yashiro. Bye.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.696
<i>March 1st is ten days away.</i>

20:41.615 --> 20:44.493
<i>There's a high chance the killer</i>
<i>will approach her.</i>

20:44.952 --> 20:47.704
<i>I need to stay by her side</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

20:54.544 --> 20:56.088
Hinazuki! You here?!

20:57.714 --> 20:58.548
Hinazuki!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.062
<i>On the deserted island</i>

21:54.896 --> 21:58.233
<i>I think about the city</i>
<i>where only I am gone.</i>

21:59.568 --> 22:01.987
<i>Children go to school</i>
<i>like they always do.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:05.907
<i>Adults go to work like they always do.</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:10.370
<i>My mother eats like she always does.</i>

22:30.599 --> 22:31.850
Hinazuki!

22:32.768 --> 22:33.727
Don't look...

22:38.565 --> 22:39.566
Close it!

22:40.776 --> 22:41.610
Hinazuki!

22:46.656 --> 22:47.949
What happened, Kayo?

22:48.658 --> 22:51.578
