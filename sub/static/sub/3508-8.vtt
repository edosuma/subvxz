Castle.
Castle.

00:09.145 --> 00:11.847
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
<i>Every writer needs inspiration,</i>

00:11.848 --> 00:13.682

<i>Detective Kate Beckett.</i>

00:13.683 --> 00:15.818
Beckett.
Beckett.

Nikki Heat?
The character he's basing on you.

Well, it's my face,
isn't it?

01:45.842 --> 01:48.677
It's not your face or someone
else's face. I don't--

01:48.678 --> 01:50.879
Well, anyway, my fellow cast members

01:50.880 --> 01:53.748

what a great networking tool it is,

Okay, should we go

Mm.

anything from this century?

02:09.031 --> 02:11.233
Why, you think the hair's a bit dated?

02:11.234 --> 02:14.236
Not exactly what I was getting at.
I know what you were getting at.

02:14.237 --> 02:16.338
You're no spring chicken
yourself, you know?

02:16.339 --> 02:18.373
Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

02:18.374 --> 02:21.676
I have two words for you--
"hairline" and "receding."

02:21.677 --> 02:23.578
Ha! Made you look.

02:23.579 --> 02:26.248
She totally got you, dad.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.649
(cell phone rings and beeps)

02:27.650 --> 02:30.185
Yes, Beckett.
Either there's a dead body

02:30.186 --> 02:32.787
or you just want to hear
my sultry voice.

02:32.788 --> 02:34.823
Dead body it is. Where?

02:34.824 --> 02:38.727
(police radio chatter)
You got here fast, Castle.

02:38.728 --> 02:41.296
My side of town.
So what do we got?

02:41.297 --> 02:44.032
May I?
Be my guest.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.768
Thank you. Our victim's name
is Caleb Shiminsky.
Shimansky.

02:46.769 --> 02:48.670
Is that an "a"?
Yeah, it's an "a."

02:48.671 --> 02:51.806
He was pulling a Kevin Bacon
in "Quicksilver," when all--
I'm sorry, a what?

02:51.807 --> 02:54.676
"Quicksilver." Kevin Bacon is
a bike messenger who failed as--

02:54.677 --> 02:56.811
Esposito, take him to school.
The victim is Caleb Shimansky,

02:56.812 --> 02:59.014
an on-duty bike messenger.

02:59.015 --> 03:01.716
A masked suspect in
a black 4-door plows into him,

03:01.717 --> 03:04.052
killing him instantly.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.054
Then the suspect steals
the messenger bag,

03:06.055 --> 03:08.556
jumps in his ride and jets off.
See? That wasn't so hard.

03:08.557 --> 03:10.725
No, no. It's good

03:10.726 --> 03:13.095
If you like the dull,
non-best-seller version.
I thought I gave it some flair.

03:13.096 --> 03:16.098
I'm assuming we have
plenty of witnesses.
Several.

03:16.099 --> 03:18.066
Three of them got the suspect's
license plate number.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.302
Aw, man.
It's like having a cheat code.

03:20.303 --> 03:23.571
You've got multiple witnesses
and a license plate number?

03:23.572 --> 03:25.974
It's gonna take you all of,
what, five minutes to solve it?
Ran the suspect's plates.

03:25.975 --> 03:31.113
The car was reported stolen an hour ago.
Masked man in a stolen car--
our thief planned this

03:31.114 --> 03:33.949
And obviously wanted what was
ever in that messenger bag.

03:33.950 --> 03:35.918
Something our vic
was delivering--

03:35.919 --> 03:37.953
A package or a box.
(Beckett) contact the courier company.

03:37.954 --> 03:40.956
I want to know what was in that bag.
Whatever it was,

03:40.957 --> 03:43.158
it was important enough
to kill the messenger.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.493
(Beckett) Sir, we got an A.P.B.
Out on the car,

03:45.494 --> 03:48.030
But Esposito and Ryan
got nothing on the canvass.

03:48.031 --> 03:50.999
Do we know what was in the package?
The, uh, courier company's
looking into it right now.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.001
Whatever it was, somebody thought that

03:53.002 --> 03:55.637
it was worth killing for.
Off the top of my head, I'm gonna  with

03:55.638 --> 03:57.139
nuclear launch codes,

03:57.140 --> 03:59.474
Dick Cheney's soul
on its way to the devil--

03:59.475 --> 04:02.110
All good theories, Castle.
All good theories.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.813
Um, sir...
Are you okay?

04:04.814 --> 04:07.115
You seem a little distracted.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.616
No, I'm focused...

04:08.617 --> 04:11.053
Focused on my precinct
being up for review

04:11.054 --> 04:13.822
and our case closure rate
being just under One-P-P's

04:13.823 --> 04:15.690
new mandated minimum, which, of course,

04:15.691 --> 04:18.060
doesn't take the budget cuts
into consideration.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.928
Now how the hell am I supposed
to catch more bad guys

04:20.930 --> 04:23.465
with fewer detectives?
Yo, Cap. Courier company said the vic

04:23.466 --> 04:25.767
only had one package in his bag,

04:25.768 --> 04:27.836
picked up from 27-39 West 2nd,
apartment, 3-c.

04:27.837 --> 04:31.139
Sent by one S. Nidal Mattar.
I ran it through the system.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.109
There's a Shakir Nidal Mattar
on the terror watch list.

04:34.110 --> 04:36.478
Could be the same guy.
Where was the package going?

04:36.479 --> 04:39.348
6-1-4 East 72nd.
East 72nd? That's the 64th precinct.

04:39.349 --> 04:42.250
Sir, that could be an attack.
I need a full tactical alert.
Have 'em evacuate the building.

04:42.251 --> 04:45.854
I'll coordinate with homeland security.
This is Detective Beckett.

04:45.855 --> 04:48.423
We have a possible terrorist
attack against the 6-4...
Yeah, this is Captain Roy Montgomery...

04:48.424 --> 04:50.658
Get E.S.U. over to the pickup
address immediately.
You got it.

04:50.659 --> 04:52.361
(Beckett) all units on alert.
Yeah, this is Montgomery
over at 12th precinct.

04:52.362 --> 04:54.062
(meows)
NYPD!

04:54.063 --> 04:56.298
(man) NYPD! Hands!
(man) Clear!

04:56.299 --> 04:58.566
Where's Nidal Mattar?
(mutters)

04:58.567 --> 05:01.870
Shakir Nidal Mattar--
Where is he?

05:01.871 --> 05:04.305
There's no Shakir Nidal Mattar here.

05:04.306 --> 05:06.541
Only Sally Niedermeyer.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.877
Ma'am, did you send a package
by bike courier this morning?

05:08.878 --> 05:11.079
Yes, I did.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.282
S. Nidal Mattar.
S. Niedermeyer.

05:14.283 --> 05:17.185
Some bozo at the courier company
wrote the name wrong.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.686
Our bad.

05:18.687 --> 05:20.688
(mouths word)
I'm going to--we can--

05:20.689 --> 05:23.125
Yeah, we can fix this.
Don't worry about it.
Sorry. It's not a problem.

05:23.126 --> 05:24.592
(drill whirs)

05:24.593 --> 05:26.594
Mrs. Niedermeyer,
somebody stole the courier bag

05:26.595 --> 05:28.130
that your package was in,

05:28.131 --> 05:30.632
and in the course of the crime,
a bike messenger was killed.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.200
Oh, that's terrible.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.137
Yeah, we're trying to figure out
why they stole the bag.

05:35.138 --> 05:37.906
You sent it to the 64th
Precinct, is that right?
Yes.

05:37.907 --> 05:39.908
Could you tell us
what was in the package?
No.

05:39.909 --> 05:41.809
No?
No.

05:41.810 --> 05:44.812
"no" you don't want to
or "no" you don't remember

05:44.813 --> 05:47.582
or know what's in the package?
Yes...

05:47.583 --> 05:50.352
To the second part,
the--the--the don't know part.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.054
Where'd you get the package?

05:52.055 --> 05:55.790
From my favorite nephew--
Brady.

05:55.791 --> 05:58.527
Okay, where can we find Brady?

05:58.528 --> 06:00.728
In prison.
"Prison" prison?

06:00.729 --> 06:03.331
When did he give you the package?
Ten years ago,

06:03.332 --> 06:05.700
just before they sent him upstate.

06:05.701 --> 06:08.170
Brady came over, handed me the package,

06:08.171 --> 06:09.737
and then he said,

06:09.738 --> 06:12.541
"mema, take good care of this package.

06:12.542 --> 06:15.610
"Don't tell <i>anyone</i> about it.

06:15.611 --> 06:18.012
And never, ever open it."

06:18.013 --> 06:20.382
Then why all of a sudden
would you messenger it?

06:20.383 --> 06:23.552
Brady called...
About 7:30 this morning,

06:23.553 --> 06:26.854
And asked me to send it right away

06:26.855 --> 06:29.958
To the man it was addressed to,

06:29.959 --> 06:31.859
The man who arrested him ten years ago--

06:31.860 --> 06:34.996
Detective Roy Montgomery.

06:34.997 --> 06:37.599
It's Captain Roy Montgomery now.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.402
Oh. You know him?

06:40.403 --> 06:42.504
Yeah. He's our boss.

06:42.505 --> 06:44.806
The package was coming to me?
(Beckett) Yeah.

06:44.807 --> 06:47.175
What's his name again?
Brady Thompson.

06:47.176 --> 06:49.478
It was back when you were
a Detective with the 6-4.

06:49.479 --> 06:51.613
Oh, yeah.
It's ringing some bells.

06:51.614 --> 06:54.583
But why would he send me
a 10-year-old package?
Esposito's on the phone
with corrections.

06:54.584 --> 06:57.185
He's trying to get an interview.
Do you recall anything at all about him?

06:57.186 --> 06:59.254
Yeah, he killed a lady--
a push-in robbery gone bad.

06:59.255 --> 07:00.755
Open-and-shut case.

07:00.756 --> 07:03.258
I think we even got
a confession out of him.

07:03.259 --> 07:05.260
The aunt said that he was
pretty insistent

07:05.261 --> 07:07.262
about getting
the package directly to you.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.964
Do you know why that would be?
You would have to ask him.

07:09.965 --> 07:12.467
Not unless you're performing
a séance. He's dead.

07:12.468 --> 07:15.970
(Esposito) got shanked
in prison this morning.
This morning?
That's no coincidence.

07:15.971 --> 07:18.173
Have records pull everything
from the old case.

07:18.174 --> 07:20.575
If memory serves, Brady was
married when we went away.

07:20.576 --> 07:22.577
See if the wife is still the wife

07:22.578 --> 07:24.479
and if she knows anything.
Beckett, call the Warden.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.481
I want to see what they know
about Brady's murder.

07:26.482 --> 07:29.050
And I need copies
of all his phone calls.

07:29.051 --> 07:31.653
I want to know exactly
what he said to Aunt Sally

07:31.654 --> 07:33.855
and anyone else, for that matter.
Okay.

07:33.856 --> 07:36.258
Hey, Beckett.

07:36.259 --> 07:38.226
Paisley Shimansky's
here to see you.

07:38.227 --> 07:40.828
That's the bike messenger's
sister. Excuse me.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.074

07:50.506 --> 07:53.475
(speaking inaudibly)

07:56.479 --> 07:58.913
How does she do that?

07:58.914 --> 08:00.982
Better than anyone I know.

08:00.983 --> 08:04.018
(continues speaking inaudibly)

08:07.756 --> 08:10.124
You okay?

08:10.125 --> 08:13.395
Her brother died
trying to get something to me.

08:13.396 --> 08:15.863
No, I'm not okay.

08:25.451 --> 08:27.886
(Beckett) the prison sent over

08:27.887 --> 08:30.455
The last two phone calls Brady made.
<i>(sally) Can't I just put it</i>
<i>in the mail?</i>

08:30.456 --> 08:33.825
<i>No, Aunt Sally. You've gotta</i>
<i>take it down there yourself.</i>

08:33.826 --> 08:36.528
<i>Oh, my hip's been acting up again.</i>
<i>Then call a messenger service.</i>

08:36.529 --> 08:38.863
<i>I'll pay you back, okay?</i>
<i>All right.</i>

08:38.864 --> 08:42.500
<i>Alright.  I'll take care of it.</i>
<i>(lowered voice)</i>
<i>I've gotta go now, okay?</i>

08:42.501 --> 08:44.936
<i>Take care now, Brady.</i>
<i>Love you.</i>

08:44.937 --> 08:48.706
<i>Love you, too, mema.</i>
<i>I-I gotta go.</i>

08:48.707 --> 08:50.007
(beep)

08:50.008 --> 08:52.043
Nothing about what was in the package.

08:52.044 --> 08:54.479
At 7:23, he makes
this phone call to his wife.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.448
(beep)
<i>(woman) yes,</i>
<i>I'll accept the charges.</i>

08:56.449 --> 08:58.049
<i>Val.</i>
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

08:58.050 --> 09:00.084
<i>Val, listen to me.</i>

09:00.085 --> 09:03.220
<i>Remember what we talked about</i>
<i>last time you visited?</i>
<i>I remember.</i>

09:03.221 --> 09:04.756
<i>It's goin' down today.</i>

09:04.757 --> 09:07.291
<i>You and Jared get out of the house now.</i>

09:07.292 --> 09:09.961
<i>But, Brady-- there's no time to talk.</i>
<i>Just go.</i>

09:09.962 --> 09:11.463
<i>Everything's gonna be all right.</i>

09:11.464 --> 09:13.498
<i>Give Jared a kiss from dad, okay?</i>

09:13.499 --> 09:15.433
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I love you, too. Bye.</i>

09:15.434 --> 09:18.670
(beep)
Brady was killed 45 minutes
after those 2 phone calls.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.905
Yeah, but we don't have a why or a who.

09:20.906 --> 09:23.908
Or a how it's related
to your mystery package.
Warden have any suspects?

09:23.909 --> 09:25.443
A whole prison yard full.

09:25.444 --> 09:28.446
He was shanked in the yard.
There were no witnesses.

09:28.447 --> 09:31.182
Warden's less than optimistic
about catching the killer.

09:31.183 --> 09:34.619
Brady have any beefs?
Apparently he was the model prisoner.

09:34.620 --> 09:38.456
Then it must have been a hit,
ordered from the outside.
By the same guy
who killed our messenger.

09:38.457 --> 09:40.792
Any luck on tracking down Brady's wife?

09:40.793 --> 09:43.661
Big fat zippo. But they left
the apartment in a hurry.

09:43.662 --> 09:46.097
I pinged their cell phones,
tracked their credit cards.

09:46.098 --> 09:47.832
She's off the grid.
Maybe not completely.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.835
I just got off the phone
with the son's school.

09:50.836 --> 09:52.904
According to the principal,
Brady's kid misses class

09:52.905 --> 09:54.606
every Tuesday because he's got

09:54.607 --> 09:56.741
some kind of respiratory condition.

09:56.742 --> 09:58.776
Tomorrow's Tuesday.
You get the doctor's name?

09:58.777 --> 10:02.947
Let's set up on the office in
the morning. We might get lucky.

10:02.948 --> 10:05.182
Whatcha doing, mother,
working on your play?

10:05.183 --> 10:07.919
Oh, I wish. I've been
bombarded with friend requests.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.954
It's like a part-time job.

10:09.955 --> 10:13.224
And these exchanges
are just ridiculous.

10:13.225 --> 10:14.726
Dot Ellison,

10:14.727 --> 10:17.261
who I have absolutely no desire
to reconnect with,

10:17.262 --> 10:20.565
has just wasted 20 minutes of my life

10:20.566 --> 10:22.867
recounting the bravery

10:22.868 --> 10:24.903
of her cat passing a kidney stone.

10:24.904 --> 10:26.905
(laughs) Well, it could've been worse.

10:26.906 --> 10:28.973
She could've sent you a video.

10:28.974 --> 10:30.909
Joining up with this fad
was a terrible mistake.

10:30.910 --> 10:33.645
Nothing good comes from the Internet.
(computer chimes)

10:33.646 --> 10:36.447
Oh, you just got
another friend request.

10:36.448 --> 10:39.517
O.M.G.! Chet Palaburn.
Who's Chet Palaburn?

10:39.518 --> 10:43.320
Star athlete, class president,
homecoming king...

10:43.321 --> 10:46.390
My high school sweetheart,
and my first.

10:46.391 --> 10:49.594
I really didn't need
to know that last part.

10:49.595 --> 10:52.096
Oh, oh. He sent a message
with his request.

10:52.097 --> 10:54.866
"I'm living in New York now
and would love to see you.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.834
Martha, you haven't changed a bit."

10:56.835 --> 10:59.671
Oh, Chet Palaburn.
Can you believe it?

10:59.672 --> 11:02.406
And did you see that message?
(giggles)

11:02.407 --> 11:04.776
You do know that Chet's comments

11:04.777 --> 11:06.911
Are based on a 20-year-old photo?

11:06.912 --> 11:08.746
Oh.

11:08.747 --> 11:09.981
Oh.

11:09.982 --> 11:11.783
Well...

11:11.784 --> 11:14.652
Should I accept his friend request?

11:14.653 --> 11:17.021
I mean, the last time
I laid eyes on him,

11:17.022 --> 11:19.557
I was 18 and--and now he sees this photo

11:19.558 --> 11:21.659
and now this and--ugh.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.095
What do I do?
It's your call.

11:24.096 --> 11:27.098
There's always Dot and her
kitty cat's medical mysteries.

11:27.099 --> 11:29.166
(chuckles)

11:30.769 --> 11:32.837
Everything okay?

11:32.838 --> 11:34.706
Another dead end in the messenger case.

11:34.707 --> 11:37.775
Uniforms located the stolen car
that ran him down,

11:37.776 --> 11:40.078
but C.S.U. got bubkes--
no prints, no hairs.

11:40.079 --> 11:42.080
It's sounding more and more
like a professional hit.

11:42.081 --> 11:44.849
Yeah.
What about surveillance?

11:44.850 --> 11:48.019
Any cameras around
where the car was dumped?
Nah. Our masked man
knew what he was doing.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.722
Well, at least our tip
on the doctor paid off.

11:50.723 --> 11:52.223
Prison vic's wife

11:52.224 --> 11:54.191
came in with her son
first thing this morning.

11:54.192 --> 11:56.594
The Captain and Beckett
are interviewing her now.

11:56.595 --> 11:58.329
I'm gonna go...
I wouldn't do...

11:58.330 --> 12:01.465
Do you have any idea who killed him?

12:01.466 --> 12:03.467
We're working on it.

12:03.468 --> 12:05.870
Mrs. Thompson, do you know
anything about a package

12:05.871 --> 12:07.905
that your husband
asked his Aunt Sally

12:07.906 --> 12:10.541
To send out for him yesterday?
Yeah.

12:10.542 --> 12:11.943
It was his insurance policy.

12:11.944 --> 12:13.845
He gave it to her when he went away.

12:13.846 --> 12:15.880
Insurance policy?
It was proof

12:15.881 --> 12:18.549
he didn't kill the woman
he went to jail for murdering.

12:18.550 --> 12:21.919
But he confessed.
Well, he might have confessed,
but he didn't do it.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.921
With all due respect, Mrs. Thompson,

12:23.922 --> 12:26.090
half the men in prison
will swear up and down

12:26.091 --> 12:28.092
they didn't do it.
Do those men's wives get a package

12:28.093 --> 12:31.462
in the mail every month
with $7,000 cash in it?

12:31.463 --> 12:33.397
(Castle) Uh, your husband confessed

12:33.398 --> 12:36.400
to a murder he didn't commit for money?
I know this will sound crazy,

12:36.401 --> 12:38.803
but we didn't know what else to do.

12:38.804 --> 12:40.838
Jared was born with
a rare respiratory disease,

12:40.839 --> 12:42.874
and we didn't have
the money or the insurance

12:42.875 --> 12:45.677
to get him the therapy he needed.

12:45.678 --> 12:48.046
If Brady hadn't done what he did,

12:48.047 --> 12:51.049
Jared wouldn't even be alive right now.
Did Brady ever tell you who
actually committed the murder

12:51.050 --> 12:53.985
He went away for?
No. I-I don't even know
if he knew who it was.

12:53.986 --> 12:56.453
Over ten years, you never asked
who his contact was,

12:56.454 --> 12:58.489
Who approached him, who was paying you?

12:58.490 --> 13:01.492
You just conveniently
never bothered to ask?
I asked! But--but Brady felt

13:01.493 --> 13:03.627
that the less I knew,
the safer I would be.

13:03.628 --> 13:06.197
E-even the packages
didn't have a return address.

13:06.198 --> 13:09.901
Look, Captain,
my husband was just killed.

13:09.902 --> 13:12.704
I'm telling you all I know.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.519
Okay, so what we know so far

13:16.587 --> 13:18.956
is that about four months ago,
the payments to Brady

13:19.023 --> 13:21.491
started arriving late, short
and then finally, not at all.

13:21.559 --> 13:23.693
And according to the wife,
that's when Brady decided

13:23.761 --> 13:25.728
to messenger over
his insurance policy.

13:25.796 --> 13:28.731
That was supposed to prove
his innocence.
Our patsy Brady
had to be in communication

13:28.799 --> 13:31.868
with whoever was making payments.
Prison should have a record
of everyone Brady talked to.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.471
We already checked his phone
logs. There's nothing there.
How about e-mail?

13:34.538 --> 13:37.007
We're running it down.
Well, whatever Brady said, it worked.

13:37.075 --> 13:39.910
Payments started up again,
then a month ago, nothing.

13:40.011 --> 13:42.012
(Ryan) Think maybe Brady got
fed up with the situation?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.247
Figured if whoever he made
the deal with wasn't holding up

13:44.315 --> 13:46.683
their end of the bargain, why was he?
Then he calls up his Aunt Sally,

13:46.750 --> 13:49.552
asks her to send the evidence
that proves his innocence

13:49.620 --> 13:52.255
to the arresting officer.
Is it possible someone was
monitoring his calls?

13:52.323 --> 13:54.291
I mean, whoever killed
our bike messenger

13:54.359 --> 13:56.759
had to have been tipped off
the package was in motion.

13:56.827 --> 13:59.829
The only people that
monitor calls are prison staff.
$7,000 a month for 10 years
is almost $1 million total.

13:59.897 --> 14:02.499
Whoever we're dealing with
obviously has the means

14:02.566 --> 14:04.901
to buy somebody off.
Get the duty roster from the prison.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.903
See who was working
when Brady made his calls.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.841
Set up a protection detail
for the wife and the kid.
It's already done, sir.

14:15.846 --> 14:19.182
Captain, you had
the confessions, the evidence.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.084
Anyone would've come to
the same conclusion.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.920
I didn't push hard enough.
I knew this case was off.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.822
Everything just fell into place
so perfectly.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.290
Now what have we got?

14:27.358 --> 14:29.393
An innocent bystander with
no connection to the killer.

14:29.460 --> 14:30.927
And without physical evidence,

14:30.995 --> 14:33.063
there's no way of tracking
who was driving that car.

14:33.131 --> 14:35.865
And catching a break on a prison
murder? That's a long shot,

14:35.933 --> 14:39.803
especially if you're dealing
with a corrupt guard.
But we still have the original
murder from ten years ago.

14:39.871 --> 14:42.939
Everything started there.
Two fresh bodies, and you want to look

14:43.007 --> 14:45.775
at a murder 10-years cold?
Uh... When I'm writing a story,

14:45.843 --> 14:47.777
the beginning is always the hardest,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.279
but if you nail that,

14:49.347 --> 14:51.281
the rest of it
could just fall into place.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.483
Castle, this is not one of your books.

14:53.551 --> 14:56.819
No, but it is a mystery, and all
mysteries <i>are</i> the same--

14:56.887 --> 14:58.821
Motive, opportunity,
cover-up, conscience.

14:58.889 --> 15:01.891
These murders today were
to cover up one ten years ago.

15:01.959 --> 15:04.027
That's where your leads are gonna be.

15:04.095 --> 15:06.363
Come on, Captain.
What do you say?

15:06.431 --> 15:08.565
Let's take a little trip
down memory lane.

15:08.632 --> 15:11.101
Olivia DeBiasse, 20 years old.

15:11.169 --> 15:13.303
Neighbors found her bludgeoned
to death in her apartment.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.073
Hmm. There were some things
missing from her apartment.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.974
Whoever killed her
tried to make it look like

15:18.042 --> 15:19.976
a robbery gone wrong.
There should be
something in there

15:20.044 --> 15:21.945
about a handyman
that we looked at for it.

15:22.012 --> 15:24.448
He had a criminal record,
he worked in the building.

15:24.515 --> 15:26.816
If it was him, I'm in
the wrong line of work.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.419
$7,000 a month for a handyman?
We moved off him once we moved on Brady.

15:29.487 --> 15:32.655
An anonymous tip came in.
Felt like a break at the time.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.624
Yeah, brought him in,
leaned on him for, what,

15:34.692 --> 15:36.793
maybe a half-hour before he broke.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.628
You know, it's funny.

15:38.696 --> 15:40.797
I-I never actually even looked
at some of these reports

15:40.864 --> 15:42.832
because once the canvassing
detectives turned them in,

15:42.900 --> 15:45.569
we already had Brady in custody.
Well, it says here that Olivia
went to a party earlier

15:45.636 --> 15:48.004
the night she was killed.
It says here the Pierson Club.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.506
The Pierson Club?

15:49.574 --> 15:52.842
That's high society.
That's crème de la crème.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.045
My money goes in banks.
Their money buys banks.
Sir, listen to this--
a waitress gave a statement

15:56.114 --> 15:58.047
saying that she saw Olivia
having a heated argument

15:58.116 --> 16:00.750
with a man at the party.
The plot thickens.

16:00.818 --> 16:02.319
Mm-hmm. There's no name,

16:02.386 --> 16:04.254
but according to
the description she gave,

16:04.322 --> 16:06.356
he was in his mid-20s, medium build,

16:06.424 --> 16:09.326
wearing a blue blazer
and an orange striped tie.
Ooh, I don't know about you guys.

16:09.393 --> 16:12.362
but I am getting a delicious
millionaire playboy vibe here.
The waitress was under the impression

16:12.430 --> 16:15.298
that he arrived with Olivia.
Olivia's best friend was
a gal that she worked with.

16:15.366 --> 16:19.736
Maybe she could tell us
who Olivia hung out with.
Perlmutter just finished reviewing

16:19.803 --> 16:22.506
Olivia's autopsy report
from back in the day.

16:22.573 --> 16:25.074
He says he found something.
You guys take the morgue.

16:25.143 --> 16:27.544
I'll follow-up on Olivia's friend.
Thank you, sir.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.046
(Perlmutter) I've gone through
Ms. Debiasse's files,

16:30.114 --> 16:31.815
and her autopsy was fairly limited.

16:31.882 --> 16:33.850
I assume, when Brady confessed,

16:33.917 --> 16:36.219
the M.E. decided not to be thorough.
Did he miss something?

16:36.287 --> 16:39.022
It's hard to say.
What does your gut tell you?

16:39.089 --> 16:41.491
My gut tells me I'm hungry, but I'm not

16:41.559 --> 16:44.561
gonna be able to eat until
I'm done with the two of you,

16:44.629 --> 16:46.563
so why don't I just tell you

16:46.631 --> 16:49.065
what my keen M.E. Training tells me?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.434
All right, Brady said he hit
Olivia with a baseball bat.

16:51.502 --> 16:54.137
But look at these.
When I look at these wounds

16:54.205 --> 16:55.938
and the skull fracture pattern,

16:56.006 --> 16:58.808
I'm just not seeing
a baseball-bat strike.
Brady lied about killing her.

16:58.876 --> 17:01.778
He might have lied about
what was used to do it.

17:01.845 --> 17:04.181
Can you determine how she was killed?
It'd only be speculating.

17:04.248 --> 17:06.650
To do it properly,
I'd have to x-ray the skull

17:06.717 --> 17:08.785
and examine the remains.
You want to exhume the body?

17:08.852 --> 17:11.354
The only way to do it right.

17:11.422 --> 17:14.324
Plus, who knows what else I might find?
Olivia was raised by a single
mom who's deceased as well.

17:14.392 --> 17:17.460
So let me call the next of kin
and see what I can do.

17:17.528 --> 17:19.529
(cell phone rings)
mm. Excuse me.

17:19.597 --> 17:21.565
(beep)
Beckett.

17:21.632 --> 17:24.032
You sure it's sanitary
to be eating here?

17:24.101 --> 17:27.002
You know the strength of
the disinfectants we use here?

17:27.070 --> 17:30.039
This is the cleanest room in the city.

17:30.107 --> 17:31.575
I couldn't.
Homemade.

17:31.642 --> 17:33.376
I couldn't.
Caught a break.

17:33.444 --> 17:35.478
The Captain talked to the friend.

17:35.546 --> 17:37.814
Does she remember who Olivia was with?
Jeff Dilahunt,

17:37.881 --> 17:40.750
who's had his fair share
of run-ins with the law.

17:40.818 --> 17:42.719
And he has a trust fund worth millions.

17:42.786 --> 17:45.154
Enough to pay $7,000 a month.
Bingo.

17:45.223 --> 17:46.356
Boo-yah.

17:46.424 --> 17:49.392
Uh, I met Olivia at a nightclub.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.394
She hadn't been in town long,

17:51.462 --> 17:54.431
but, uh, she seemed like
a real party girl.
Were the two of you dating?

17:54.498 --> 17:56.700
Uh, no. Just friends.

17:56.767 --> 18:00.503
What, can't a guy and a girl
just be friends?
Please.

18:00.571 --> 18:02.405
Are you two together?

18:02.473 --> 18:04.541
Not yet.
Absolutely not.

18:05.943 --> 18:08.945
Look, it was, uh, no big deal.

18:09.012 --> 18:11.781
I happened to mention
that a school friend of mine

18:11.849 --> 18:15.151
was having a family reunion
here at the Pierson Club

18:15.219 --> 18:17.487
and asked me to stop by.
Olivia really wanted to come.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.590
So I took her.
Who would want to go to
someone else's family reunion?

18:20.658 --> 18:22.626
Well, I suppose that
all depends on the family.

18:22.693 --> 18:24.827
In this case, it happened
to be the Wellesleys.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.230
The w--
the "Wellesleys" Wellesleys?

18:27.298 --> 18:28.898
The rich and powerful Wellesleys?

18:28.966 --> 18:30.533
The conservative, New York Wellesleys?

18:30.601 --> 18:32.535
(clears throat)
wasn't that one of our senators?

18:32.603 --> 18:35.238
Yeah, he was. Senator Casper Wellesley.
Oh.

18:35.306 --> 18:37.374
He died in the early '90s.
His kid's running for his seat

18:37.441 --> 18:40.042
again this year.
Well, I'll tell you what,

18:40.110 --> 18:43.079
next time I'm invited, I'll take you.
Mr. Dilahunt, where were you

18:43.147 --> 18:46.082
between 10:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M.
the night that she was killed?

18:46.150 --> 18:49.552
Okay, well, a couple of, uh,
Wellesley cousins and I

18:49.620 --> 18:51.788
bailed early and went clubbing.

18:51.855 --> 18:53.823
I believe there may have been

18:53.891 --> 18:56.058
Bolivian marching powder involved.

18:56.126 --> 18:59.529
We got picked up
for public intoxication.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.964
My father got
the charges dropped, but, uh,

19:02.032 --> 19:04.066
there's still a record of our arrest.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.703
If you can't find it, I have
a framed copy at home.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.706
(chuckles)
did you have an argument
with Olivia that night

19:09.774 --> 19:12.175
or see anyone else who did?
No.

19:12.242 --> 19:14.311
A witness saw Olivia having it out

19:14.378 --> 19:17.079
with a man in a blue blazer
and an orange striped tie.

19:17.147 --> 19:19.048
Do you remember anyone
who fit that description?

19:19.116 --> 19:21.384
Actually, I do.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.153
All Wellesley family events
have a strict dress code.

19:24.221 --> 19:27.056
The, uh, blazers are standard,

19:27.124 --> 19:29.025
but Lenanne Wellesley,
the family matriarch,

19:29.092 --> 19:32.195
hand picks the men's ties.

19:34.365 --> 19:36.966
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

19:37.034 --> 19:39.068
Yep. We got a hell of a lot of suspects.

19:41.651 --> 19:43.251
Yes, chief.
No, I know, chief.

19:43.319 --> 19:46.755
As soon as I possibly can, chief.

19:46.823 --> 19:48.423
They cut our staff 20%,

19:48.491 --> 19:50.626
and they get upset when
our clure rate drops 3%.

19:50.694 --> 19:53.662
You ask me, we're working
miracles to do what we're doing.

19:53.730 --> 19:56.331
Sir, we can do this later
if you have a higher priority.

19:56.399 --> 19:59.334
Never let the job get in the way
of the job. Where were we?
Well, Brady and his contact

19:59.402 --> 20:01.336
communicated through
a dummy e-mail account.

20:01.404 --> 20:03.739
We tried to trace the address,
but it was a dead end.

20:03.807 --> 20:05.975
Where are we
with reviewing the guards?

20:06.042 --> 20:09.344
Nowhere. The Warden refuses to
provide us with a duty roster.
Said he was offended we assumed

20:09.412 --> 20:12.715
one of his men was dirty,
wanted to handle it in-house.

20:12.782 --> 20:14.750
Yeah? Well, that doesn't work for me.

20:14.818 --> 20:16.752
(Beckett) do any of these men
look like the one

20:16.820 --> 20:19.387
that you saw arguing with Olivia
the night of the party?

20:19.455 --> 20:21.389
Look, it was a stupid
waitress job ten years ago.

20:21.457 --> 20:24.392
Do you remember what you were
doing ten years ago?
Can you recall any details?

20:24.460 --> 20:26.729
Was he wearing glasses?
Did he have a tattoo?

20:26.796 --> 20:29.498
All I know is that the man
was yelling at the girl.

20:29.565 --> 20:32.001
He got so riled up,
he spilled his wine.

20:32.068 --> 20:35.137
And I ended up cleaning it
off the carpet.
Did he spill any on himself?

20:35.204 --> 20:36.739
I don't know. Maybe.

20:36.806 --> 20:39.975
(muttering)

20:41.945 --> 20:44.446
(Castle and Beckett) him!

20:44.514 --> 20:47.182
Trent Wellesley? I'm
Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.284
I need to have a word.

20:49.352 --> 20:52.521
Yes. My old friend Jeff said
I might be hearing from you.

20:52.588 --> 20:55.090
Lice?
Are they the police?
Yes, grandmother.

20:55.158 --> 20:57.192
My ring was stolen.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.261
Oh, oh, they're not here
for you, grandmother.

20:59.328 --> 21:02.798
My ring was stolen.
It's expensive.

21:02.866 --> 21:05.400
Trent, perhaps you should take
this conversation elsewhere?

21:05.468 --> 21:07.269
Of course, Frank.

21:07.336 --> 21:10.706
She gets a little confused sometimes.

21:10.774 --> 21:12.775
(singsong voice) Okay.

21:12.842 --> 21:15.443
(normal voice)
Let's get this over with.

21:15.511 --> 21:17.880
It was me.
It was you, what?

21:17.947 --> 21:20.415
I was the one who had
the argument with the girl that

21:20.483 --> 21:23.185
Jeff brought to the reunion that
night, the girl who was killed.

21:23.252 --> 21:26.354
I didn't care for her behavior,
so I asked her to leave.

21:26.422 --> 21:29.357
Girls like that hang around
families like mine for a reason.

21:29.425 --> 21:33.595
They want something.
Jeff brought her as his plus one.

21:33.663 --> 21:36.331
But he had left by then, and she stayed.

21:36.399 --> 21:39.634
She tried to chat up
more than one of my relatives.
Anyone in particular?

21:39.703 --> 21:41.636
You're barking up the wrong tree.

21:41.705 --> 21:43.172
No one in <i>my family</i>

21:43.239 --> 21:45.507
had anything to do
with what happened to her.

21:45.575 --> 21:49.878
Someone paid almost $1 million
to cover up her murder.

21:49.946 --> 21:51.446
That makes everyone in your family
a suspect, including you.

21:51.514 --> 21:54.416
Trust me, if I had that kind
of money to throw around,

21:54.483 --> 21:57.786
I wouldn't be here
sucking up to the old lady.
Nice.

21:57.854 --> 22:01.056
You think I'm rich because
my last name's Wellesley.

22:01.124 --> 22:03.892
But my dad died when I was a kid.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.394
Mom and me had to pretty much survive

22:06.462 --> 22:09.064
off the handouts of relatives.
Well, I suppose getting a job
would be out of the question.

22:09.132 --> 22:11.433
Who are you protecting?

22:11.500 --> 22:14.770
You already admitted
to arguing with her.
It really does not look good.

22:14.838 --> 22:17.773
You have to understand... He's
like the only father I have.

22:17.841 --> 22:20.876
Who are you talking about, Trent?
My Uncle Winston.

22:20.944 --> 22:23.178
He had just been through
a bad break-up.

22:23.246 --> 22:26.548
He's the kind of person that
people try to take advantage of.

22:26.616 --> 22:28.283
People like who,

22:28.351 --> 22:31.353
Olivia or poor relations
looking for a handout?

22:31.420 --> 22:34.056
I'd seen her with him before.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.195
Yes, it was terrible,
what happened to that poor girl.

22:40.263 --> 22:42.297
Could you tell us about
the kind of relationship

22:42.365 --> 22:44.299
You had with her, Mr. Wellesley?

22:44.367 --> 22:47.069
Was the reunion the first time
that you two met?

22:47.137 --> 22:49.071
Actually, I believe I met Olivia

22:49.139 --> 22:51.406
at a cocktail party
a few weeks before that.

22:51.474 --> 22:53.809
Was it MOMA?
I don't recall.

22:53.877 --> 22:56.678
Anyway, I took a shine to her.

22:56.746 --> 22:58.446
Charming, ambitious,

22:58.514 --> 23:00.916
rough around the edges--
but I felt I could mentor her.

23:00.984 --> 23:03.252
And by "mentor" you mean?

23:03.319 --> 23:04.953
What are you suggesting?

23:05.021 --> 23:06.955
Your nephew Trent said that

23:07.023 --> 23:09.324
he saw her hitting on you
the whole night.

23:09.392 --> 23:11.160
Well, that's Trent for you.

23:11.227 --> 23:13.561
He's always been
very protective of the family.

23:13.629 --> 23:16.031
Where were you between
10:00 P.M. And 2:00 A.M.

23:16.099 --> 23:18.633
On the night she was murdered?
Are you seriously asking me,

23:18.701 --> 23:21.203
Winston Wellesley, for an alibi?

23:21.271 --> 23:24.206
Oh. Apparently you are.

23:24.274 --> 23:25.774
Fine. I was home.

23:25.842 --> 23:28.043
Can anyone corroborate that?

23:28.111 --> 23:31.046
Yes. God.
(man) Mr. Wellesley,

23:31.114 --> 23:32.815
Your car is ready.

23:32.882 --> 23:34.349
Mm.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.651
As delightful as this
conversation has been,

23:36.719 --> 23:38.653
I must take my leave.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.656
I have to meet my brother
at his campaign headquarters.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.726
Ah, yes, Blake Wellesley,
running for senate again.

23:44.794 --> 23:47.629
Mm-hmm. And we'd appreciate
your support.

23:47.697 --> 23:50.332
Don't forget to vote.

23:51.868 --> 23:54.736
I have no doubt he was having
an affair with Olivia.

23:54.804 --> 23:57.706
But why would he kill her?
Do you think maybe
he was upset

23:57.773 --> 24:00.175
that she came
with someone else?
Mm. Jealousy, money, murder--

24:00.243 --> 24:02.177
Does it get any better than this?

24:02.245 --> 24:04.880
You want to exhume my niece's body?

24:04.948 --> 24:06.748
We believe that there was evidence

24:06.816 --> 24:09.551
Overlooked during the autopsy
that could lead to her killer.

24:09.618 --> 24:12.087
Well, you told me you caught the man.

24:12.155 --> 24:16.024
You told me it was over.
I thought it was,
but whoever killed Olivia

24:16.092 --> 24:18.026
Just murdered two more people.

24:18.094 --> 24:21.463
Your niece deserves justice,
and so do they.

24:21.530 --> 24:24.333
She was such a special girl.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.401
She quit school...

24:26.469 --> 24:30.205
to take care of her mother
when the cancer got bad.

24:30.273 --> 24:32.207
That says a lot about her.

24:32.275 --> 24:33.842
After her mother passed,

24:33.910 --> 24:36.311
it was like she had to get away.

24:36.379 --> 24:38.413
When she moved to the city,

24:38.481 --> 24:42.251
I was just so happy for her.

24:42.318 --> 24:44.619
But then...

24:47.590 --> 24:50.359
You'll... bury her back
the way she was?

24:50.426 --> 24:52.494
Of course.

24:54.297 --> 24:57.299
At least she had
the funeral she deserved.

24:57.367 --> 24:59.467
Thank God for Mr. Wellesley.

24:59.535 --> 25:01.003
Mr. Wellesley?

25:01.070 --> 25:04.773
The man who paid for everything.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.209
Which Mr. Wellesley was that?

25:07.277 --> 25:09.144
Winston Wellesley.

25:09.212 --> 25:10.812
(Castle) Paid for her funeral?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.581
Can anyone say "guilty conscience"?
Yeah.

25:13.649 --> 25:15.717
Hey, Esposito, run down
Winston Wellesley's alibi.

25:15.785 --> 25:18.987
Talk to doormen, chauffeurs,
the whole gamut.
I'll see what I can do.

25:19.055 --> 25:22.057
Thank you.
The prison duty roster.
How'd you pull it off, sir?

25:22.125 --> 25:23.558
They didn't make me Captain

25:23.626 --> 25:25.593
Just because I look good behind a desk.

25:25.661 --> 25:27.595
Run all the guards on that roster.

25:27.663 --> 25:30.498
Look for anything out of the ordinary.
Sir, I'm gonna call the cemetery

25:30.566 --> 25:33.735
To make arrangements
to exhume the body tomorrow.
You know what I don't get?
Whoever is behind this,

25:33.803 --> 25:36.571
why'd he stop paying Brady?
Wellesleys have plenty of money.

25:36.639 --> 25:39.274
If the money hadn't stopped,
Brady never would've set off

25:39.342 --> 25:42.311
this triggering domino
that started all this.
Let me let you in on a little secret.

25:42.378 --> 25:45.880
You know how rich people
stay rich? They are cheap.

25:45.949 --> 25:48.317
Why pay for Brady
for the rest of his life

25:48.384 --> 25:51.320
When you can kill him
for a fraction of the price?
But then why would he wait ten years?

25:51.387 --> 25:53.621
Something changed.
Something must have happened.
Yeah.

25:53.689 --> 25:55.490
Captain Montgomery.
Blake Wellesley.

25:55.558 --> 25:58.427
Hate to bother you, but do you
have a minute to chat?

25:58.494 --> 26:00.429
I speak for the entire Wellesley family

26:00.496 --> 26:02.764
When I say you can expect
our full cooperation

26:02.832 --> 26:04.799
in this investigation.

26:04.867 --> 26:08.437
But? You can tell.
There's a "but" coming.
Not a "but." a "however."

26:08.504 --> 26:11.406
Like I said, we'll cooperate,
however, we request that

26:11.474 --> 26:13.541
these unannounced interviews
come to a stop.

26:13.609 --> 26:15.043
Here we go.

26:15.111 --> 26:17.712
Beckett, let's hear him out.

26:17.780 --> 26:20.248
I apologize if I'm coming off

26:20.316 --> 26:22.250
like one of those guys, Detective.

26:22.318 --> 26:25.253
It's just that these impromptu
visits are a bit awkward.

26:25.321 --> 26:26.521
My nephew Trent

26:26.589 --> 26:28.991
said you spoke to him
when he visited my mother.

26:29.058 --> 26:30.959
Mother became very confused, very upset.

26:31.027 --> 26:33.895
I'm sure there's a better way
to facilitate this.
Like what?

26:33.963 --> 26:35.730
Well, I propose
that all further interviews

26:35.798 --> 26:38.433
be coordinated by me
and conducted at my offices.

26:38.501 --> 26:40.402
What do you think?

26:40.470 --> 26:42.404
Thank you for your offer,
Mr. Wellesley.

26:42.472 --> 26:45.874
That's very nice of you.
Not at all.
I'll give you my number.

26:45.941 --> 26:48.877
Hold on.
I, too, have a "however."

26:48.944 --> 26:51.579
Thank you for your offer,
however,

26:51.647 --> 26:53.548
my detectives will conduct
their investigation

26:53.616 --> 26:55.950
in any manner they see fit.

26:56.019 --> 26:57.952
Captain, I can get
the commissioner on the phone

26:58.021 --> 26:59.421
in under a minute.

26:59.489 --> 27:03.958
Well, tell him I said hi
and I really could use a raise.

27:04.027 --> 27:08.596
I think we're done here.

27:14.437 --> 27:17.572
That was awesome!
Whatever you guys are doing,
keep doing it.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.474
They're circling the wagons.

27:19.542 --> 27:21.476
Awesome.

27:22.912 --> 27:25.380
"ignore." "accept."

27:25.448 --> 27:27.782
"ignore." no.

27:27.850 --> 27:30.885
"accept." no.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.688
(exhales deeply)

27:35.191 --> 27:36.724
Oh, mother, come on.

27:36.792 --> 27:39.027
Accept the man's
friend request already.

27:39.095 --> 27:41.296
Using that old photo
was a horrible idea.

27:41.364 --> 27:44.966
Why didn't you stop me?
Since when have I had the power
to stop you from doing anything?

27:45.034 --> 27:47.969
What will Chet think
if he expects 1980s-Martha,

27:48.037 --> 27:50.572
And... Pfft...
Present-day Martha shows up?

27:50.639 --> 27:52.874
You tell anyone I said this
and I'll deny it,

27:52.942 --> 27:55.110
and I'm only gonna say it once.

27:55.178 --> 27:57.112
1980s-Martha was pretty great.

27:57.180 --> 28:00.482
But present-day Martha...
Is pretty spectacular, too.

28:04.587 --> 28:05.920
(clicks)

28:05.988 --> 28:08.156
Did you just accept that?
Yeah.

28:08.224 --> 28:10.192
Well, take it back.
I'm sorry. I cannot.

28:10.259 --> 28:12.427
I--oh, god.
No, but since it's done,

28:12.495 --> 28:14.963
why don't you take a visit
to Chet's page

28:15.030 --> 28:17.532
and see what he looks like nowadays?
Oh-ah-ah.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.734
Uh, just like this?
Press that?
Mm-hmm.

28:19.802 --> 28:21.803
Ooh, good l--
well, that's Chet.

28:21.870 --> 28:25.107
But... (blows air)
how old is that photo?

28:25.174 --> 28:27.109
Turnabout is fair play, mother.

28:27.176 --> 28:28.977
(sighs)

28:29.044 --> 28:33.248
Chet Palaburn.
What are you thinking, man?

28:33.316 --> 28:34.749
(Perlmutter) City workers

28:34.817 --> 28:37.085
brought the coffin in an hour ago.

28:37.153 --> 28:39.221
Boy, Winston didn't spare any
pennies with this box of wood.

28:39.288 --> 28:41.789
This is the Bentley of caskets.
Shopping ahead?

28:41.857 --> 28:44.392
Research. Derrick Storm,
in "Storm Warning,"

28:44.460 --> 28:45.927
Finds a murder weapon

28:45.995 --> 28:48.296
buried in a coffin
a year before the murder occurs.

28:48.364 --> 28:50.499
Of course, who am I talking to?
You know this.

28:50.566 --> 28:52.501
Uh, back in the nonfiction section,

28:52.568 --> 28:55.504
We have a real casket that's
been sealed for ten years,

28:55.571 --> 28:57.972
so there's gonna be
some serious decomposition.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.841
When I crack this open,

28:59.908 --> 29:03.077
expect the foulest
of foul stenches. (blows air)

29:04.580 --> 29:06.248
(inhales deeply)

29:06.315 --> 29:08.183
Set?

29:08.251 --> 29:11.085
Okay.

29:11.154 --> 29:14.322
Ready? Here we go.

29:19.795 --> 29:21.329
(groans)

29:23.065 --> 29:25.767
(Castle) Is the body missing,

29:25.834 --> 29:28.770
or did you just pull off
an awesome magic trick?

29:28.837 --> 29:30.872
You are amazing, sir.

29:35.276 --> 29:36.910
Nope, no prints.

29:36.978 --> 29:38.813
Whoever removed
Olivia's remains was careful.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.782
Bye.
How do these people manage
to stay one step ahead of us?

29:41.850 --> 29:44.685
Olivia's aunt said it was
an open-casket funeral.

29:44.753 --> 29:47.355
So her body must have
been in here at one point.

29:47.422 --> 29:49.657
The mortuary company must have
switched out the bodies

29:49.725 --> 29:52.660
between the funeral and the burial.
Yeah, but the company
is out of business,

29:52.728 --> 29:55.663
So there's no way of finding out.
Winston had to have paid
to get rid of the body

29:55.731 --> 29:58.366
just in case Brady ever wanted
to come clean with the police.
Mm-hmm. Looks like it.

29:58.433 --> 30:01.301
This guy's got contingency plans
for his contingency plans.

30:01.370 --> 30:03.371
It feels like we're battling
a super villain.

30:03.438 --> 30:07.040
Uh, excuse me, Dynamic Duo.
What am I doing with this?
Well, it depends.

30:07.108 --> 30:09.477
What can you get for
a secondhand casket these days?

30:09.544 --> 30:11.479
I'll call Olivia's family and find out

30:11.546 --> 30:13.781
what they want to do.
Seriously, though?

30:13.849 --> 30:16.784
I wonder what you could get
for a slightly used coffin.

30:16.852 --> 30:19.987
That thing is top of the line.
Did you check the drawer?
What drawer?

30:20.054 --> 30:21.655
High-end coffins often have

30:21.723 --> 30:23.657
a small drawer
hidden somewhere in the lid.

30:23.725 --> 30:26.994
That way families can place
mementos in there

30:27.061 --> 30:30.197
or psychotic killers can hide evidence.

30:35.604 --> 30:37.204
Thank you. Sorry.

30:43.812 --> 30:46.013
Nothing suspicious.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.015
It's just a bunch of family photographs.

30:48.082 --> 30:49.784
What does that button say?

30:49.851 --> 30:52.453
Looks like a political button.

30:54.155 --> 30:57.725
"Edna DeBiasse." is
Edna DeBiasse Olivia's mother?

30:59.494 --> 31:01.829
Let me borrow your magnifying glass.

31:01.897 --> 31:04.865
I don't have a magnifying glass.
Isn't that standard issue
for detectives?

31:04.933 --> 31:07.000
No, not since Sherlock Holmes.

31:07.068 --> 31:08.636
You can use mine.

31:08.703 --> 31:10.170
Of course.

31:10.238 --> 31:12.372
Mm-hmm.

31:14.042 --> 31:16.844
(Beckett) "Casper Wellesley

31:16.912 --> 31:19.146
Senate '78."

31:19.213 --> 31:21.615
Olivia's mother worked on the campaign.

31:21.683 --> 31:24.217
All roads lead to Wellesley.

31:24.285 --> 31:27.555
(Beckett)
Are you looking at porn?
I use Ryan's computer for that.

31:27.622 --> 31:30.023
I've been searching
a periodical database.

31:30.091 --> 31:32.025
Look what I found.
In this article,

31:32.093 --> 31:34.061
it talks about how during
his 1978 senate run,

31:34.128 --> 31:36.430
Casper had his sons, Blake and Winston,

31:36.498 --> 31:38.466
heading up his
campaign headquarters in Ithaca.
Where Olivia's mom worked.

31:38.533 --> 31:40.367
She and Winston
had to have crossed paths.

31:40.435 --> 31:43.771
Exactly. Now why would Winston
keep that from us?

31:43.839 --> 31:45.072
Hmm.

31:49.044 --> 31:50.945
We ran all the guards' names

31:51.012 --> 31:53.848
off that duty roster
you got us from Brady's prison.

31:53.915 --> 31:56.116
He's the only one that red flagged.
Name's Patterson.

31:56.184 --> 31:59.653
Made a deposit last month
for $5,000 cash.

31:59.721 --> 32:01.522
Then the day Brady was killed,

32:01.590 --> 32:04.057
he makes another deposit
in cash, this time for $10,000.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.094
If there's anything I hate,
it's a dirtbag in uniform.
Mm-hmm.

32:07.161 --> 32:11.164
So where are you guys at with
Winston Wellesley's alibi?
We have a few leads.

32:11.232 --> 32:13.734
Keep pushing on that.
I'll push on this.

32:16.972 --> 32:19.439
Mr. Wellesley, we are going
to find out the truth.

32:19.508 --> 32:20.908
And the amount of dust

32:20.976 --> 32:24.177
that we kick up doing that
is entirely up to you.

32:24.245 --> 32:26.981
I do seem to recall, uh,
making her acquaintance.

32:27.048 --> 32:29.884
You're telling us half-truths again.

32:29.951 --> 32:32.285
We already know that you paid
for Olivia's funeral.

32:32.353 --> 32:34.555
We know that you knew her mom.

32:34.623 --> 32:36.557
Either you start telling me the truth,

32:36.625 --> 32:39.026
or you're gonna spend the last few weeks

32:39.093 --> 32:41.061
of your brother's campaign
issuing denials

32:41.129 --> 32:44.097
After I release what I know
to the press.
Fine. I knew her mother.

32:44.165 --> 32:46.099
After her mother passed,
Olivia set about

32:46.167 --> 32:49.670
to unravel the mystery of her origins.

32:49.738 --> 32:51.939
Olivia was clever.

32:52.007 --> 32:53.373
She put together the clues,

32:53.441 --> 32:55.442
found out her father was a Wellesley--

32:55.510 --> 32:58.412
A Wellesley and...
And?

33:01.049 --> 33:04.652
Actually, the truth is,
I'm Olivia's father.

33:04.719 --> 33:06.720
I know.

33:06.788 --> 33:08.722
I had the same look on my face

33:08.790 --> 33:10.858
when Olivia told me ten years ago.

33:10.926 --> 33:12.927
And Olivia's mother didn't tell you?

33:12.994 --> 33:14.695
Mnh-mnh.
Didn't tell Olivia either.

33:14.763 --> 33:18.599
I was just on the verge
of telling everyone when she...

33:18.667 --> 33:21.769
When she was tragically killed.

33:21.836 --> 33:25.238
It is a tragedy when a father
kills his daughter, isn't it?
What?

33:25.306 --> 33:27.407
What do you know
about Olivia's missing body?

33:27.475 --> 33:30.444
Nothing. That's obscene.

33:30.511 --> 33:33.246
Who would do something like that?

33:33.314 --> 33:35.616
You, so no one would ever
find out the truth

33:35.684 --> 33:37.551
of who she really was.
I didn't kill her,

33:37.619 --> 33:40.153
and I certainly didn't hide her body.

33:40.221 --> 33:42.122
Yet, ten years after her death,

33:42.190 --> 33:44.458
you're still trying to hide
her existence.

33:44.525 --> 33:47.761
Well, you have to understand.
I have a family to protect.

33:47.829 --> 33:51.031
Olivia was family.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.333
Hmm.

33:53.401 --> 33:55.703
Winston Wellesley, you did it.

33:55.770 --> 33:59.873
He might have, but we don't
have the evidence to prove it.
(Esposito) that's because he didn't.

33:59.941 --> 34:03.043
We were able to verify Winston's alibi.

34:03.111 --> 34:07.214
He really was home alone?

34:07.281 --> 34:10.382
Winston had some
romantic company that night.
Oh, he was home,
well, then if he had an alibi,

34:10.451 --> 34:12.585
Why didn't he just say so
from the start?

34:12.654 --> 34:14.588
Maybe because of who
his romantic company was.

34:14.656 --> 34:17.290
Stanley Jenkins.

34:17.358 --> 34:19.960
Is Stanley a unisex name now
or is Winston--

34:20.027 --> 34:22.195
Gay? Uh, yeah. He's gay.

34:22.263 --> 34:25.364
He lied to us.
Who is he protecting?

34:25.433 --> 34:28.534
Well, he said it himself.

34:28.603 --> 34:30.036
Family.

34:32.681 --> 34:34.416
You have to understand
that this young woman--

34:34.484 --> 34:36.418
Olivia--
I hardly knew her.

34:36.485 --> 34:38.888
Maybe I shook her hand
at the party, but that's all.

34:38.956 --> 34:41.123
And now you're telling me
her mother and I worked

34:41.190 --> 34:44.761
the same campaign 30 years ago?
You and your brother were in
Ithaca July and August of '78.

34:44.828 --> 34:47.929
Olivia was born may, '79.
That's 9 months later.
Your brother claimed paternity,

34:47.998 --> 34:50.967
But I think we all know
that's highly unlikely.

34:51.034 --> 34:53.101
Winston, what the hell is going on here?

34:53.170 --> 34:56.739
Blake, it's time to get
the lawyers involved.
What did you know
about this, Winston?

34:56.806 --> 35:00.609
This is not the time or the place.

35:00.677 --> 35:03.712
I never saw Edna after that summer.

35:03.781 --> 35:06.515
She never told me anything.
So you admit to sleeping with her?

35:06.583 --> 35:08.584
She must have not wanted
to rock the boat,

35:08.652 --> 35:11.587
hurt my father's campaign with
a scandal involving his son.

35:11.655 --> 35:13.089
Blake, you've said enough.

35:13.157 --> 35:15.691
I just found out I had
a daughter I never knew about,

35:15.759 --> 35:17.160
a daughter who was murdered

35:17.227 --> 35:19.796
and whose killer
apparently is still at large.

35:19.863 --> 35:23.465
Why did you tell the police
you were her father? Why?
(Castle) actually, the question is,

35:23.533 --> 35:26.969
Why did he tell Olivia that
ten years ago?

35:27.037 --> 35:30.306
You have to understand, Blake.

35:30.373 --> 35:32.308
This was during the first senate run.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.343
Scandal would've killed the campaign.

35:34.411 --> 35:37.046
I lost the damn election anyway.

35:37.114 --> 35:40.516
You had no right to make
that decision without me.
We were only looking out
for your best interests.

35:40.583 --> 35:45.521
We?
Winston, who is "we"?

35:47.991 --> 35:51.493
(Blake) mother, do you remember Olivia--

35:51.561 --> 35:53.996
Olivia DeBiasse?
Of course I do.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.832
I have my mind.

35:55.899 --> 35:58.234
Mrs. Wellesley, we need to a--
Who are you?

35:58.302 --> 36:01.804
Blake, that's not Olivia.

36:01.872 --> 36:03.739
Yes, mother.
This is a police Detective,

36:03.807 --> 36:05.241
Investigating--

36:05.309 --> 36:07.643
Oh, yes.
My ring was stolen.

36:07.711 --> 36:10.213
It was very expensive.
Yes, ma'am.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.215
Uh, but before we can deal with that,

36:12.282 --> 36:14.217
We need to ask you a few questions

36:14.284 --> 36:15.818
about Olivia DeBiasse.

36:15.886 --> 36:17.786
(chuckles) Olivia...

36:17.855 --> 36:19.788
Came to me looking for a father,

36:19.857 --> 36:22.225
so I gave her Winston.

36:22.292 --> 36:25.494
A child would go <i>a long way</i>
to butch up s image.

36:25.562 --> 36:28.331
But she was <i>my</i> daughter, mother.

36:28.398 --> 36:30.933
(chuckles) You were too special.

36:31.001 --> 36:33.402
You're going to be a Senator,

36:33.470 --> 36:36.405
maybe even President someday.

36:36.473 --> 36:38.674
Mrs. Wellesley, what happened to Olivia

36:38.742 --> 36:40.676
the night of her murder?

36:40.744 --> 36:43.679
Ooh! So many questions about--
I don't care for questions.

36:43.747 --> 36:46.048
Olivia questioned me.

36:46.116 --> 36:50.319
Ugh! The gall of that girl.
Mr. Wellesley, your mother is ill.

36:50.387 --> 36:51.820
She can't handle the stress--

36:51.889 --> 36:54.656
Oh, shut it, Frank.
I can handle anything.

36:54.724 --> 36:57.659
It's dangerous for her
to get this riled up.

36:57.727 --> 36:59.862
I'm getting her medication from the car.

36:59.930 --> 37:02.865
(chuckles) What does
any of this have to do

37:02.933 --> 37:06.102
with my stolen ring?

37:06.169 --> 37:09.939
Mother... Did you go to
Olivia's apartment that night?

37:10.007 --> 37:13.042
She crossed me, had to be stopped.

37:13.110 --> 37:14.944
What did you do, mother?

37:17.614 --> 37:20.883
Mrs. Wellesley...

37:20.951 --> 37:23.152
Did you kill Olivia DeBiasse?

37:23.220 --> 37:26.789
Kill her?
Why would I kill her?

37:26.856 --> 37:28.857
N-no.

37:28.926 --> 37:32.795
I... said "take care of it,"
and it was taken care of.

37:37.867 --> 37:40.836
And who did you ask to take care of it?

37:40.904 --> 37:43.472
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Frank Davis.

37:43.540 --> 37:45.507
Sorry, pal. Got the wrong guy.
I don't think so, pal.

37:45.575 --> 37:47.643
I just spent the better part of a day

37:47.710 --> 37:49.778
sweating a guard named Patterson,

37:49.846 --> 37:52.848
who works at the prison where
Brady Thompson was killed.

37:52.916 --> 37:56.319
I don't know any Brady thompson
and I don't know any Patterson.
That's funny, 'cause he knows you.

37:56.386 --> 37:58.787
Said that you paid him to monitor

37:58.855 --> 38:01.557
Brady thompson's calls about a package.
No. No, no, no.

38:01.624 --> 38:04.126
Said that you paid him to have a lifer

38:04.194 --> 38:06.562
put a shiv in Brady Thompson's back.

38:06.629 --> 38:09.531
Now you tell me how I got
the wrong guy. Cuffs.

38:09.599 --> 38:12.335
So Frank was the family hit man?

38:12.402 --> 38:14.703
More like the family fixer.
He cleaned up all types of dirt

38:14.771 --> 38:16.705
for Senator Wellesley back in the day.

38:16.773 --> 38:19.075
He knows where
all the bodies are buried.
And which ones needed to be dug up.

38:19.142 --> 38:21.077
And then after he got rid of Olivia

38:21.144 --> 38:22.644
on Mrs. Wellesley's orders,

38:22.712 --> 38:24.646
he called around
to all his low-life connections

38:24.714 --> 38:27.616
until he found someone
desperate enough to cut a deal.
Then why, after ten years,

38:27.684 --> 38:30.886
would he suddenly stop paying
Brady to do his jail time?
When Mrs. Wellesley lost her faculties,

38:30.954 --> 38:33.922
Blake was granted power of attorney.
Frank couldn't get the money
to make the payments anymore.

38:33.991 --> 38:36.492
So he stopped, figuring Brady
would just disappear?

38:36.559 --> 38:38.527
And when he found out Brady had evidence

38:38.595 --> 38:40.696
to prove his innocence, Frank panicked.

38:40.763 --> 38:43.932
He stole Mrs. Wellesley's ring
and hocked it to finance

38:44.001 --> 38:46.969
his plan to shut Brady up permanently.
By the way, took a look
at the precinct's numbers.

38:47.037 --> 38:48.471
Three closed cases

38:48.538 --> 38:50.839
puts us just over
the mandated case closure rate,

38:50.907 --> 38:52.875
right in time for the review tomorrow.

38:52.942 --> 38:54.843
You know what's even better than that?

38:54.911 --> 38:56.845
After ten years,
I can call Olivia's aunt

38:56.913 --> 39:00.549
And tell her that we really
got the guy, finally.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.787
And you get to give
the messenger's sister

39:05.855 --> 39:07.823
Some closure, too.
Mm-hmm.

39:07.891 --> 39:10.759
Though I don't suppose having
answers makes it any easier.

39:10.827 --> 39:14.630
It does... In time.

39:32.649 --> 39:34.316
(Alexis) I can't believe

39:34.384 --> 39:36.552
how many lives were ruined
over one woman's need

39:36.619 --> 39:38.554
to protect her family's reputation.

39:38.621 --> 39:40.556
You will never have this problem.

39:40.623 --> 39:42.058
Between Grams and myself,

39:42.125 --> 39:44.060
our family reputation's
already in ruins.

39:44.127 --> 39:46.062
Mm, lucky me.
Yeah.

39:46.129 --> 39:48.064
What's gonna happen to Brady's son?

39:48.131 --> 39:50.066
Well, there's a silver lining there.

39:50.133 --> 39:53.069
When Blake Wellesley found out
why Brady sold his freedom...
Mm-hmm.

39:53.136 --> 39:55.737
He pledged $20 million
to a local kids' charity...
Mm.

39:55.805 --> 39:59.108
Who agreed to handle Brady's son's care.
Oh, that's so sweet.

39:59.176 --> 40:01.177
And wow.
(Alexis chuckles)

40:01.244 --> 40:03.679
Lookin' good, Grams.
Hot date?

40:03.746 --> 40:06.615
Dining and dancing with Chet Palaburn.

40:06.683 --> 40:09.751
What if he turns out to be
bloated and ugly?

40:09.819 --> 40:12.821
Oh, how superficial do you think I am?

40:12.889 --> 40:14.990
Intensely. Mother, what is going on?

40:15.058 --> 40:18.094
Present-day Martha is going on.

40:18.161 --> 40:21.663
I've had filthy, stinking rich.
I've had broke, dirt-poor.

40:21.731 --> 40:24.300
And you know what I want now?

40:24.367 --> 40:26.034
Fun.

40:26.103 --> 40:27.636
Just fun.

40:27.704 --> 40:30.739
And if you aren't what Chet's expecting?

40:30.807 --> 40:33.542
Oh, please, darling.
Look at me.

40:33.610 --> 40:36.445
Come on. It doesn't get
any better than that.

40:36.513 --> 40:37.946
(laughs)

40:38.014 --> 40:41.283
Don't wait up for me, kids.

40:41.351 --> 40:44.253
Mama's on the prowl.

40:44.321 --> 40:46.255
(Salme Dahlstrom's
"C'mon Y'all" playing)

40:46.323 --> 40:48.824
Oh, that poor bastard.
(sighs)

40:48.891 --> 40:50.459
Is insanity inherited?

40:50.527 --> 40:52.194
