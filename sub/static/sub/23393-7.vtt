00:55.180 --> 00:56.681
How was the funeral?

00:57.265 --> 00:58.975
Best one this week.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.187
I'd give it four out of five headstones.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.938
Why'd you hold back on the fifth?

01:04.022 --> 01:07.609
Oh, to get the fifth headstone,
I need something really special.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.320
You know, marching bands. Fireworks.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.988
All-you-can-eat vodka.

[sighs]

01:14.657 --> 01:18.036
You know, if you used your glasses,
you wouldn't need to squint.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.580
Duh. I'd use them if I could find them.

01:22.415 --> 01:26.044
Is a hundred dollars too much to pay
for same-day shipping?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.378
Finally pulling the trigger

01:27.462 --> 01:29.839
on that canoe you've had
in your shopping cart for weeks?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.884
Already on the way. I'm talking cribs.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.513
Surprisingly traditional choice.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.141
I'm sure it'll look postmodern
when you finish putting it together.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.144
Sol's putting it together,
then I will "Frankie-tize" it.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.105
Oh, I assume that means
a lot of hemp and beads.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.568
Beads are a choking hazard, Grace.
What kind of grandmother are you?

01:50.652 --> 01:53.029
The kind that buys the crib
and never goes near it again.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.367
-That better not be my credit card.
-Oh, don't worry.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.702
I'm not using your card
without permission.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.703
Thank you.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.831
I'm using Sol's card without permission.

02:02.914 --> 02:06.126
Oh, God, Frankie. You really gotta get
your cards and your life back.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.044
I've been trying.
I don't know what to do anymore.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.339
They turned off my cell phone today.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.968
Which reminds me,
you've gotta put me on your family plan.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.720
[phone rings]

02:17.804 --> 02:19.222
I'm not answering that.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.057
-I will.
-No, no, no!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.892
Only old people use the landline.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.812
And the only reason they use it is
to give us directions to a funeral home.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.273
But it might be Coyote or Bud.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.650
They know that my cell phone was shut off.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.570
Hello?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.405
Uh-huh.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.781
Uh-huh.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.033
Ah, it's for you.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.910
Someone died.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.120
[Grace sighs]

02:46.708 --> 02:49.085
I'm sorry about your friend Mary.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.212
Me, too.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.465
Another funeral I've got to go to.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.926
Another funeral we have to go to.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.970
So you're going with me?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.683
Unless you'd like me to go on my own.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.436
Well, you took a cruise on your own.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.397
Yes. And I could take a cruise
to the funeral,

03:09.480 --> 03:13.151
but I don't know
what the docking situation is there.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.446
Look, you don't have to go.
I mean, Mary wasn't your friend.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.740
I said I'll go. Okay?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.744
-Unless you don't want to.
-Do you want me to go or not?

03:22.827 --> 03:27.957
Because I could use the time
to build my granddaughter's crib.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.504
I would love to have you with me,
but I totally understand.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.425
I mean, you are retired and have all
the time in the world to assemble a crib,

03:37.508 --> 03:39.719
but you're right. You shouldn't go.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.724
Are you upset I'm not going?

03:46.643 --> 03:48.978
I'm upset we're still having
this conversation.

04:08.957 --> 04:09.791
No, you don't.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.752
You're calling to see what special plans
I have for us tomorrow.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.003
I'm calling to cancel.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.339
-My friend Mary died.
-Oh, my God.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.300
Boy, I'm not often wrong, but when I am...

04:19.384 --> 04:21.636
I'm so sorry. When's the funeral?
I'll pick you up.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.514
No! No, you don't need to come.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.556
Why not?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.685
Mary was a friend of yours.
I'd really love to be there for you.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.187
As good as that sounds... no.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.607
We just started sleepovers
and meeting family.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.777
If we do funerals now,
what have we got to look forward to?

04:37.860 --> 04:40.822
Are you sure? I look damn fine in black.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.241
So does Morticia Addams,
and I'm not going with her, either.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.868
You know who else looks great in black?
My chauffeur.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.870
The least I can do
is have him drive you there.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.708
Listen, when I go to a funeral in a long,
black car, I won't be returning.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.584
[chuckles]

04:56.671 --> 04:59.424
Anybody die since I went upstairs?

04:59.507 --> 05:03.845
I almost did... when Nick said
he wanted to join me at Mary's funeral.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.263
That's sweet, right?

05:05.346 --> 05:07.098
No, it's a terrible idea.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.141
Why?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.145
What do you think when you see a man
with a much younger woman?

05:12.228 --> 05:13.855
How tall is he?

05:13.938 --> 05:14.939
Doesn't matter.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.985
Height matters a lot to women, Grace.
I mean, not with you, apparently.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.779
You tower over Nick
like the Empire State Building.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.614
Well, I think that what people see

05:23.698 --> 05:26.326
is a man desperately trying to deny
how old he is.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.036
And it is pathetic.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.580
-Especially if he's short.
-Especially if he's me.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.500
I'm the short man who doesn't want
his friends to think he's pathetic.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.586
Then don't wear heels.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.380
Oh, Jesus. Good talk, Frances.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.975
Hmm.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.729
How is it that I'm a single mother
with four kids under the age of nine

05:54.812 --> 05:56.856
and I still get to work before you?

05:58.107 --> 06:00.985
-What?
-I said, how is it I'm a single mother--

06:01.069 --> 06:03.196
Heard you, don't care. Why are you here?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.748
-What's this?
-My resume.

06:13.831 --> 06:14.874
Why is this?

06:14.957 --> 06:18.336
Because I'm going crazy at home
and I need adult stimulation.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.547
Okay, go see Mom.
She manufactures adult stimulation.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.382
I need a job.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.595
And you realize there's a proper protocol,
it's called an "application."

06:27.678 --> 06:30.723
-And please include two references.
-You can at least hear me out.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.435
I have a great product idea for kids.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.187
-Hate it already.
-Why?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.855
Children don't have money.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.733
Brianna, you could at least
listen to my idea.

06:40.817 --> 06:45.571
Or tomorrow,
I show up even earlier with my kids.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.782
-Agh.
-All four of them.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.659
One, two, three, four.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.538
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
I will call in the product nerds

06:53.621 --> 06:57.875
where you can pitch your nerd ideas
to the people I pay to hear nerd shit.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.544
You're a great sister.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.587
Still gonna need those references.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.297
-Will you be a reference?
-Nope.

'Kay.

07:08.427 --> 07:13.224
Hey, what did those cute zebras,
elephants, and giraffes ever do to you?

07:13.307 --> 07:15.643
Nothing. That's why I'm cutting 'em loose.

07:15.726 --> 07:19.188
So our granddaughter is just going
to be looking at strings?

07:19.272 --> 07:25.027
No. She's gonna be looking up
at Gloria Steinem, Maya Angelou,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.655
and Snoop Dogg, just 'cause I like him.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.823
And...

07:28.906 --> 07:32.118
Oh, wait! Amelia Earhart is missing.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.286
We lost her again?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.037
No, no, here she is.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.789
And your credit card I borrowed.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.460
I'm sorry, I might have maxed it out
at the 99 Cent Store.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.420
You know how that stuff all adds up.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.255
Frankie, this is insane.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.133
I know. I had to leave two berets behind.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.052
No. I mean, we have to get you back
to the land of the living.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.432
Oh, says you, says Grace, says me.
I just don't know how.

07:54.515 --> 07:59.270
All right. I was hoping we wouldn't have
to go this far, but I have an idea.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.689
We need to get you arrested.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.233
Arrested? How is that gonna help anything?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.819
They can't process someone who's dead.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.531
Once you break the law,
suddenly you mean something to someone.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.075
We used to be so good at breaking the law.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.744
We sure were.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.370
I know you've done time recently,

08:16.454 --> 08:20.374
but I haven't been arrested
since we went to that cosmetic company

08:20.458 --> 08:22.919
and tried to free those test rabbits.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.921
I live with that failure every day.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.925
Every time I close my eyes,
I can see those rabbits.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.968
Oh, there's one.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.053
There's one.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.846
Oh, God, there's one.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.349
Come on, Frankie. Let's do it.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.184
Let's get you born again.
It'll be like old times.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.354
I guess we don't have anything to lose.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.356
I mean, you're retired, I'm dead.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.399
Let's do some good and get you arrested!

08:45.483 --> 08:48.236
Yes! I'm coming for you, my furry friends!

08:48.319 --> 08:49.403
[both] Yes!

08:49.904 --> 08:51.781
[laughing]

08:54.825 --> 08:58.496
When Sol dies,
he wants to be turned into a coral reef.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.624
[chuckles]
Frankie wants to be shot into outer space.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.710
[chuckles]
Boy, did we end up with weird people.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.837
Well, you chose your weird person.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.548
I was tethered to mine.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.177
Do you remember
our first funeral together?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.220
Your Aunt Gwen?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.139
-Brianna's hamster, Stud.
-Oh!

09:17.223 --> 09:18.683
Stud...

09:18.766 --> 09:21.519
That was the day
Brianna almost showed emotion.

09:21.602 --> 09:26.232
Am I a terrible person that I felt
more emotional with Stud's passing

09:26.315 --> 09:28.693
-than I do with Mary's?
-Not at all.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.612
A hamster like Stud
doesn't come along very often.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.365
No, I'm serious, Robert. I liked Mary.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.784
Why don't I feel anything?

09:36.867 --> 09:40.079
I think you're just becoming numb
from going to so many of these.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.831
-Yeah.
-Here we are.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.671
Well, at least this one's different.
They have a valet.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.967
That's no valet.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.058
-Nick, what...
-I know you said not to come...

10:01.142 --> 10:05.062
You were probably confused by that.
See, what I meant was, "Don't come."

10:05.146 --> 10:07.648
You just lost a friend,
so I wanted to be supportive.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.942
I'm fine. I don't need support.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.360
Here's your cane, Grace.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.321
You must be Robert.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.864
Yes, and you are?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.657
Nick Skolka. Funeral crasher.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.492
This is Nick? Your Nick?

10:18.576 --> 10:19.952
Oh, you've heard of me.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.413
-That's a good sign.
-Yeah, well, don't read into it.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.041
Oh, it's just that you're so young.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.500
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.546
I just hadn't heard
that you were so much... less... older.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.631
[laughs]

10:31.714 --> 10:33.924
Okay, you speak now.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.968
Congrats on your Tappy Award.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.430
-How did you know about my Tappy?
-I own dressbarn.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.223
You may have seen me
on  Undercover Boss.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.185
-I hadn't, but I'll look for you.
-I dress as a lady.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.229
-Oh, my.
-Would you excuse us just for few minutes?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.606
-I'll park the car.
-Thanks.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.692
This is really weird for me, Nick.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.737
See, my friends don't know about us

10:54.820 --> 10:56.906
and a funeral
isn't the place to tell them.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.742
Oh, for fuck's sake.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
Especially her.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.498
-The woman or the blind dog?
-Hi.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.383
Ah! You kept it.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.510
You were so excited
to burn your first bra,

11:17.593 --> 11:19.637
you almost forgot to take it off.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.389
Yeah, thanks for your help on that.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.725
Man, we did some crazy shit together.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.645
-Oh, and look at us doing it again, man.
-Far out.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.188
Oh! Here they are.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.817
Our old recon photos
of the animal testing facility.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.319
Are we gonna stick with our old plan?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.780
I would, but I don't remember what it is.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.323
Me, neither. [laughs]

11:39.407 --> 11:41.534
You know, I saw something
on  The Americans.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.576
I'm listening.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.994
When Martha was about to--

11:44.078 --> 11:46.122
No, no, no, no! I haven't caught up yet!

11:46.205 --> 11:49.333
Okay, okay, new plan.
I'll run interference--

11:49.417 --> 11:51.544
And I'll run around
and open all the cages.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.796
Yes! You're going to need this.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.257
Oh, God. Out of sight.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.179
Well, I know I'm going to miss
Mary's infectious laugh.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.598
She seemed to never have a bad day, huh?

12:05.182 --> 12:08.352
I wouldn't call dying on
the plastic surgeon's table a good day.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.104
That's how it happened?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.398
[gasps] Oh, my God.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.650
Grace, I wasn't sure I'd see you again,

12:14.733 --> 12:16.569
but I never thought
I'd see you with a cane.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.736
Well...

12:18.571 --> 12:21.115
it's what you get when you ski...
a black diamond.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.118
Skiing, in the middle of summer?

12:24.869 --> 12:28.289
Water-skiing on Black Diamond... Lake.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.333
-I've heard it's beautiful there!
-Mm-hmm.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.127
I didn't know you water-skied.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.379
Oh, Grace wanted us to try it for years.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.799
It took us getting divorced before
she finally picked it up on her own.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.717
Yeah. See?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.720
Hey, do you need me to get you anything?

12:43.888 --> 12:47.475
Grace, I think your aide
is trying to get your attention.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.810
He's not my aide.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.270
Oh, sorry.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.522
I'm Janet. Who might you be?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.442
-I'm Nick. I'm with Grace. I'm her...
-Associate.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.236
-Associate.
-Your associate?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.362
We associate.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.657
So nice to meet your... younger associate.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.909
He's not so young.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.577
-He's very rich.
-She's right.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.871
-I'm super rich and super old.
-Yeah.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.915
Come on, let's go get a refreshment, Nick.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.834
We can talk about
how much you love soft food.

13:16.086 --> 13:20.174
I have to pay my respects to Mary's family
and then we can sneak out.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.510
Until then... here.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.970
[softly] Lay low.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.057
If I lay any lower,
I'll be spending eternity next to Mary.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.517
Just stay.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.442
You're not staying for my pitch?

13:39.443 --> 13:43.447
I wish I could, but I've got a thing,
a big thing, that I need to un-thing.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.575
Take good care of my sister, you guys.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.079
Um...

13:50.162 --> 13:53.999
[laughs nervously] So, Brianna says
you have an amazing product idea

13:54.083 --> 13:56.794
that we absolutely have to make work
unless we absolutely can't.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.338
Yes! So... [clears throat]

13:59.421 --> 14:01.924
...kids are not getting
the vitamin D they need these days

14:02.007 --> 14:04.843
because doctors, rightfully,
are telling them to stay out of the sun.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.595
Big problem. It's big.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.056
I saw my niece recently. A ghost.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.558
Exactly.

14:10.641 --> 14:15.229
What I want to talk to you about today
is vitamin D-infused sunscreen for kids.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.815
Wow. No can do.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.986
The kids market
is impossibly tough to tap.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.572
Okay. Well, it doesn't have to be
just for kids.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.783
-That market's hard to tap, too.
-The everybody market?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.245
It's more about the lotion.
We're not really a lotion business.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.873
Okay. All of your products are lotions.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.791
You have a lotion machine downstairs.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.628
It's called an extruder,
but it's really more for creams and gels.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.841
Okay, I see what's going on here.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.552
Uh, you do?

14:46.635 --> 14:49.221
Yeah. My sister told you to placate me
and get me out,

14:49.305 --> 14:51.515
because I'm just an unqualified,
stay-at-home mom

14:51.599 --> 14:53.517
who's never had a full-time job.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.269
That's it, right?

14:59.565 --> 15:03.110
Can we send you home with some of our...
nighttime foot gels?

Honestly, I don't know
how you went without me.

15:27.635 --> 15:28.844
We would've had a blast.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.681
Especially after a few
Peter, Paul, and Bloody Marys.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.350
Did they have a Judy Tom Collins?

15:34.433 --> 15:37.227
[laughing]

15:37.311 --> 15:38.270
Oh, God.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.440
Robert would have hated it.

15:41.523 --> 15:45.402
Speaking of, I've gotta ask:
how was Robert on a protest?

15:46.153 --> 15:49.490
Robert tried.
It's just not in his DNA like with us.

15:49.573 --> 15:53.160
I guess you gotta cut him some slack.
He's a square like Grace.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.331
Try explaining to a square
just what Jerry meant to the Dead.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.376
-They're just never gonna get it.
-No kidding.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.379
The only "Jerry" Robert knows
is Jerry Herman.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.714
Who the quack is that?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.508
He wrote  Mack and Mabel.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.968
Who the quack are they?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.428
[laughing]

16:16.558 --> 16:19.186
So, what's next for the Tappy winner?

16:19.269 --> 16:21.397
I'm starring in a new production.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.024
Although I'm kind of regretting it.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.610
It's causing a rift
between me and my husband.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.028
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.822
-What show?
-The Music Man.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.740
-Are you playing Harold Hill?
-I am.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.867
I was Harold Hill at UC Santa Barbara!

16:33.951 --> 16:36.120
Get out of here,
that was my safety school.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.373
I played in front of hundreds of students,
parents, homeless surfer dudes.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.041
I wish I'd played it in college.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.503
Then maybe I could remember
some of these lyrics to "Trouble."

16:44.586 --> 16:45.754
You're not alone, my friend.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.756
Even this college junior started wondering

16:47.840 --> 16:50.384
if the majestic Quaalude
had taken its toll on his memory.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.137
-So what did you do?
-I switched to cocaine.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.972
That's not going to help me.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.933
-I'm not even allowed to have caffeine.
-Oh.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.603
Say, shall we go and get
some decaffeinated refreshments?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.481
I'm afraid to move.
Grace has me laying low.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.983
Hmm.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.276
I know that game.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.861
I'm not used to that game.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.446
I keep trying to push
this relationship forward and she's--

17:11.530 --> 17:12.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.076
There's your problem.
You cannot push Grace.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.704
Take it from someone
who pushed her over the edge.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.247
I gotta do something.

17:21.330 --> 17:22.665
I'm crazy about her.

17:24.917 --> 17:29.339
Then you have to lay back a little
and let her make her way to you.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.386
Of course, I am the gay ex-husband,

17:34.470 --> 17:37.222
so you have to take everything from me
with a grain of salt.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.348
[chuckles]

17:38.432 --> 17:41.477
I don't know how Mary's gonna live
without Sonny.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.228
He was everything to her.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.815
Arlene, honey, it's Mary who passed.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.026
Sonny is standing right over there.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.444
See?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.697
Oh, right, of course.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.993
Well, maybe it was just wishful thinking.
I was never a fan of Sonny.

Nick played Harold Hill in college?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.514
No. Did he play it at a funeral home?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.225
Well, Sunday matinees
sometimes felt that way.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.686
Oh. Excuse me,
I'm gonna go get some ambrosia.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.774
I was helping him learn a song
after you banished me to the corner.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.651
Am I not supposed
to talk to anybody, either?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.236
Talk, yes.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.238
Throw a USO show, no.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.699
Look, I'm sorry I came here today.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.660
I am just annoying you.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.328
Maybe I should just go.

Look, you are annoying me,
but at least I'm feeling something.

That's cool.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.804
Oh, just the two of you?

18:58.887 --> 19:02.432
Or should I come back in a minute
when you're a party of 12?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.144
Do you know of an animal testing plant
that's supposed to be here?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.396
It's gone. It's Chili's now.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.689
Welcome to Chili's.

19:08.772 --> 19:12.442
Well, at least someone did
what had to be done and shut them down.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.695
Oh, no. They just moved to Nevada.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.280
Nevada? [scoffs]

19:16.864 --> 19:19.199
-Back in the car, Sol.
-Oh, Frankie.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.703
My back is already killing me and
I haven't felt my driving foot in an hour.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.497
-I don't know if I can do it.
-Oh, bummer.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.918
I was looking forward to causing a big
hullabaloo and getting myself arrested.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.672
Want to front-end load some nachos
so the blood rushes back to your foot?

19:33.755 --> 19:37.301
Mm, nachos.
I'm starting to feel my toes already.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.178
Two, please, at the bar.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.555
And I'm gonna need
a children's activity pack.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.764
Hmm.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.516
Hop this way.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.853
[chuckles]

19:47.936 --> 19:52.983
It feels like every day
I get a call that somebody else died.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.236
Frankie and I even have a phone line
designated for that.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.573
I don't know why we're leaving.
We'll probably all be back here tomorrow.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.700
I heard the other day
that Reggie Dunlop died.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.244
What are you talking about?
I'm still here.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.704
Don't rush me.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.622
Oops.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.748
Sorry, Reggie.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.876
But I did hear
that Hank Gondorff left us last night.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.462
Hank was sick for such a long time.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.839
Even the strong and the healthy
are leaving us.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.425
I heard that Phil Milstein died recently.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.012
-What?
-You remember that guy, our contractor.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.931
And he was in such great shape.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.600
[Janet] That's horrible.
Phil did our master bedroom.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.310
[Arlene] Oh, he did all our bathrooms.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.063
I kept breaking things
so he would come back.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.315
Everything all right?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.399
Grace?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.110
Uh...

20:37.194 --> 20:40.322
[stammers]
I forgot to say something to Sonny.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.213
Hey, how'd it go?

20:56.296 --> 20:59.633
I'm still in shock.
It went amazingly well.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.009
They flipped for it.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.261
-They did?
-Yeah.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.596
They're firing up the extruder
as we speak.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.474
-Really?
-No, not really.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.018
They blew me off
just like you told them to do.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.687
They told you I told them to blow you off?

21:11.770 --> 21:15.274
They didn't have to. I'm a mom
with four kids who lie to me all the time.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.151
This is shitty, even for you.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.113
Mal, I wasn't trying to blow you off.

21:21.196 --> 21:23.407
We're just not doing any new stuff.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.827
-Why?
-Just leave it at that

21:26.910 --> 21:29.454
-and it's time to say bye-bye.
-What? No. No, no, no, no.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.082
What's happening? Nobody...

21:34.584 --> 21:37.713
My kids taught me that, too. Not leaving
until you tell me what's going on.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.841
No. You cannot keep a secret
to save your life.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.635
Bullshit. I didn't tell anyone
about your prostitute!

21:44.886 --> 21:46.179
Hi, Danny.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.181
Have a good day, Danny.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.478
Danny doesn't count. Danny overheard.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.606
-You don't get to decide if Danny counts.
-Fine.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.737
-[sighs] You're annoying.
-Mmm.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.705
So last year we spent a lot of money
on a wrinkle reducer

22:11.788 --> 22:14.624
that I thought was a game changer.
It was a sure thing.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.126
But...

22:16.626 --> 22:20.130
Somehow my nemesis
found out about it and stole it.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.217
Mmm. And you couldn't let Lauren
beat you to market,

22:24.301 --> 22:27.387
so you rushed out something inferior.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.555
Maybe...

22:29.347 --> 22:30.640
I...

22:30.724 --> 22:31.933
did that.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.271
I took a hit.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.648
A big hit.

22:40.067 --> 22:40.901
How bad?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.906
An I-haven't-told-Barry-yet bad.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.618
Well, Barry works for the competitor--

22:49.701 --> 22:52.245
Mom-can-never-know bad.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.956
-That is bad.
-Mm-hmm.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.169
Okay, look, maybe I can help you. Okay?

22:59.753 --> 23:04.049
The more time I'm here, the less time
I have to be telling your secret to Mom.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.760
Fine.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.430
You can be an intern.
It's an unpaid position.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.766
I'm worth every penny.

23:21.399 --> 23:22.400
[Robert] Hey.

23:23.777 --> 23:24.820
Oh, hey.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.571
Are you okay?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.115
No.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.910
-It's not what you're thinking.
-Hmm?

23:31.993 --> 23:34.204
I never did what you did. [sniffles]

23:34.871 --> 23:36.414
But it's as close as I ever got.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.792
While we were married?

23:39.835 --> 23:41.461
Yes, but I didn't.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.840
I wanted to...

23:46.007 --> 23:46.842
but I didn't.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.387
We found each other years later and...

23:50.971 --> 23:52.722
After the divorce and...

23:53.557 --> 23:54.724
Then you did.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.229
It got complicated.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.607
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.361
I missed my chance. Twice.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.071
Oh, come on, Grace.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.739
There'll be other chances.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.032
Oh, really?

24:11.116 --> 24:14.995
When? Look where we are.
This is what we're doing these days.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.831
Hey, it's not what I'm doing,
it's not what you're doing.

24:17.914 --> 24:21.751
It's not what you're doing
because you're really living.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.920
You took your chance.

24:24.671 --> 24:25.755
You found happiness.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.341
Rough patch at the moment.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.551
Sensitive subject.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.845
-Well, you'll figure it out.
-You will, too.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.388
Oh, yeah? How?

24:33.471 --> 24:36.266
By taking every chance
that comes your way.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.603
Like the one standing over there.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.027
I don't even know what that is.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.695
So find out.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.826
Mmm!

24:55.577 --> 24:59.331
Wow. These El Jimador Frescas
are cold and strong.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.416
Brain freeze!

25:01.499 --> 25:03.418
Press your tongue
against the roof of your mouth.

25:04.252 --> 25:06.129
Now say, "Free the Bunnies."

25:06.213 --> 25:07.797
Free the bunnies.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.841
[laughing]

25:11.176 --> 25:13.637
You know, we may not have saved
a single rabbit

25:13.720 --> 25:15.180
and you may still be dead,

25:15.263 --> 25:18.850
but I've had more fun with you today
than I've had with Robert in months.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.185
Most people do.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.854
I'm serious.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.233
What's going on with you two?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.818
I don't know, but I'm worried.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.739
There are times when I feel stuff...

25:33.865 --> 25:35.283
not good stuff...

25:36.034 --> 25:38.161
that I never felt with you.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.747
Well, we have our thing, Sol.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.249
Yes.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.085
Our thing.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.586
Our soul-mate thing.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.505
Of course.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.507
What if we only get one?

25:51.299 --> 25:54.636
We may be soul mates,
but we weren't meant to be together.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.264
You and Robert were meant to be together.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.558
But I miss having a soul mate.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.644
Hmm.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.897
I'm not gonna marry you again, Sol.
[chuckles]

26:08.316 --> 26:11.069
Janet, are you flirting with Nick?

26:11.152 --> 26:13.196
Well... maybe.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.365
I don't blame you.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.951
Oh.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.328
Even with a cane, he makes me feel young.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.330
-Let's get out of here.
-All right.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.457
Bye.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.545
I thought you were gonna go home
with Robert.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.424
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to take me home.

26:32.507 --> 26:36.303
I'll get the car.
Well, I'll have my driver get the car.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.183
-You all set?
-Robert, thank you for the...

26:42.892 --> 26:44.144
for the lift.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.193
[door opens]

26:55.447 --> 26:57.991
-[Frankie sighs]
-How was your day?

26:58.116 --> 27:00.744
Oh... I'm still dead.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.079
Well, you're in good company.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.956
[phone ringing]

27:09.627 --> 27:10.712
[groans]

27:10.795 --> 27:11.880
Your turn.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.048
Oh, God.

27:17.135 --> 27:17.969
Hello?

27:18.720 --> 27:19.721
Uh.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.307
Uh-huh.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.224
It's for you.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.436
Is it Chili's?
Did they find my rabbit ears?

27:26.519 --> 27:27.604
Hello?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.356
Oh!

27:29.439 --> 27:33.943
The baby's coming!
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!

27:34.027 --> 27:37.113
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!
The baby's coming!

27:37.197 --> 27:42.744
Baby's coming!
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!

27:42.827 --> 27:44.037
[chuckling] Oh, God.
