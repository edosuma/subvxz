(PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC)

00:20.938 --> 00:22.269
Good afternoon, Cedarvi/le!

00:23.191 --> 00:24.180
(ALL CHEER)

00:26.194 --> 00:29.106
It is my distinct
honor to present

00:29.238 --> 00:32.150
our annual
community service award

00:32.241 --> 00:34.778
to one of our most
outstanding citizens.

00:35.036 --> 00:39.951
Now, many of you
may recognize him
as Coach Bob

00:40.041 --> 00:41.952
of our champion
Little League team.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.499
And some of you may know him

00:43.628 --> 00:47.291
as the treasurer of
our Harvest Scholarship Fund.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.710
But / know that all of you
know him as the guy

00:50.801 --> 00:52.837
that owns the only
gas station in town.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.885
(LAUGHTER)

00:54.972 --> 00:58.885
Bob Harris, get on
up here with that
beautiful family of yours.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.978
Bob Harris, folks!

01:04.815 --> 01:08.478
Bob, your community activism,
charity work

01:08.778 --> 01:12.691
and character represent
the finest Cedarville
has to offer.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.818
Please accept this
on behalf of all of us

01:14.951 --> 01:16.111
and know that we love you.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.958
(COUPLE KISSING)

01:35.972 --> 01:38.258
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:46.857 --> 01:48.313
(GASPING FOR BREATH)

01:48.693 --> 01:49.773
Are you all right?

01:51.570 --> 01:52.559
Bob?

01:58.661 --> 01:59.946
You're crushing me.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.449
Wake up!

02:05.418 --> 02:06.407
(WHEEZING)

02:06.544 --> 02:08.705
I think you're
having a heart attack.
I'm gonna call the ambulance.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.174
NO. Just drive me
to the hospital.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.247
As the new Dean of Medicine,
I'd like to personally welcome

02:51.339 --> 02:53.751
all of our new
employees and ask

02:53.841 --> 02:55.081
why the hell do you
want to come back?

02:57.595 --> 02:58.880
Tired of surfing.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.507
He hasn't changed.

03:00.598 --> 03:04.307
And neither has
thejob, right?
We still get to do crazy crap?

03:04.435 --> 03:07.017
Save people's lives
instead ijust
their noses?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.481
About that,
about the crazy stuff...

03:09.565 --> 03:11.851
Here we go.
He's gone from
ally to enemy.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.523
He has no choice.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.351
He's the boss now.

03:15.446 --> 03:16.481
He has to be professional.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.981
Has to base his decisions
on what's best for
the entire hospital.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.156
We can't take it personally.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.449
Couldn't have said
it better myself.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.609
You did.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.495
I'm just reading
the notes on your desk.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.626
He also wants us
to spy for him.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.123
Not spy.
I'm trying to keep
House out of prison.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.337
To do that, I need to know
what he's doing and planning.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.455
Spy.
Spy.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.549
Come on, guys.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.969
Look, I am your boss,
you do have to
treat me appropriately,

03:42.056 --> 03:44.297
but it doesn't have to
be awkward and weird.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.596
Outside of work,
I still consider
us all friends.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.597
I'm glad you feel that way,
because I do have
a favor to ask.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.645
I told House I
couldn't come back
until next week.

03:51.774 --> 03:55.016
He said he
understood completely
and that l was fired, so...

04:00.908 --> 04:04.025
Since I have my kids
for the next two days,
I need a babysitter.

04:04.870 --> 04:05.905
NO.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.788
Male patient went into V-fib,
but shows no
signs of heart disease

04:12.878 --> 04:16.370
or any other
symptoms for that matter.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.795
What was he
doing when his heart
decided to do the mambo?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.841
He said he was at work.

04:28.686 --> 04:29.721
You're late.

04:29.812 --> 04:30.892
According to my calendar,
I'm a week early.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.519
Beard's a nice touch.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.315
Lets everyone know
that you're not
a teenage girl.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.982
Now, you two
make a cute couple.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.064
And you two...

04:46.287 --> 04:47.402
It's not important.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.621
Dr. Park.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.165
You're a lot taller
than I thought you'd be.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.867
And I look forward
to working with you,
as well.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.374
He's lying.
Not just Taub,
the patient.

04:57.465 --> 05:01.208
These abrasions on his knees,
they're minty fresh.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.542
They're about 10 hours old.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.967
He got them
playing
flag football.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.466
He said he got them
playing flag football.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.094
I'm sure that's true,
if flag is
a euphemism for "penis"

05:09.226 --> 05:11.478
and football is
a euphemism for
"entering a vagina".

05:11.896 --> 05:13.727
Why lie about it?
Everybody lies.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.480
Speaking of which,
how are your two baby girls?

05:16.567 --> 05:18.899
Wow, twins. Congratulations.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.109
Awkwa rd .

05:21.197 --> 05:23.904
He knocked up
two different
women at the same time.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.232
At least he thinks he did.
Did you have
the DNA tested yet?

05:26.327 --> 05:27.407
Why would I?
They look just like me.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.571
But they will grow.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.406
Find out what else
he's lying about.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.738
DO an exercise test,
see if you can

05:31.874 --> 05:33.080
get him to go back
into V-fib again.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.541
But we could end up
causing another
cardiac arrest.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.793
Hopefully, then we'll
know what set it Off.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.917
He means,
it's better to do it here
where we can revive him

05:41.008 --> 05:42.418
than have it
happen somewhere else.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.543
The prodigal son has returned.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.883
Now if you'll
excuse me, l have to go

05:48.974 --> 05:50.805
slaughter
a fatted
calf for lunch.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.810
I told you,
I was sitting at my desk
when the attack happened.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.941
These rug burns
are from last night.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.771
We think you were having sex,
but memory loss
could also be a symptom.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.981
Maybe we should
ask your wife?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.116
BOB: Don't.

06:11.247 --> 06:15.866
I did something
stupid last night,
but it was a one-time thing.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.451
You have no idea how
bad | feel about it.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.703
Your guilt is
between you and your wife,

06:20.965 --> 06:23.547
we just need to
know what happened.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.131
l was having sex at a motel

06:28.347 --> 06:29.962
when I started to
feel light-headed.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.139
Next thing I knew,
I was lying on my back,

06:32.476 --> 06:34.387
I could barely breathe.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.563
Is everything all right?

06:36.647 --> 06:38.308
We'd like to
perform an exercise test.

06:38.816 --> 06:41.899
Recreate the stress
that may have
caused his symptoms.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.851
He was sitting at his desk.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.186
It's his heart
we're worried about.

06:45.281 --> 06:46.817
The test will
monitor its rhythm

06:46.949 --> 06:48.485
so we can check for
any abnormalities.

06:55.416 --> 06:59.000
I spent a month in solitary.
You don't think I can
keep this up all day?

07:07.386 --> 07:10.002
l have a headache.
Could you just
lower your voice?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.134
Chase and Taub are back!

07:14.852 --> 07:17.434
You want me to pick
up an ice cream cake?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.182
I also think that Taub

07:19.273 --> 07:22.390
has brought his
little Taubettes
into work with him today.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.561
And why would he do that?

07:23.694 --> 07:25.309
Because I didn't give him time
to do anything else.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.484
SO then I started wondering,

07:26.572 --> 07:29.188
"Who'd be sappy enough
to watch them for him?"

07:30.242 --> 07:31.618
They're not here.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.863
What?

07:33.996 --> 07:36.578
| just came for
a chat with a friend.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.324
What's that I smell, friend?

07:40.419 --> 07:42.705
I understand your confusion.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.038
l was eating
a baby for lunch and...

07:47.051 --> 07:48.416
l have a massive migraine.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.217
Will you,
please, just go away?

07:53.932 --> 07:56.389
You should
probably lie down
to rest.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.974
Yeah, I was trying to.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.885
Oh...

08:00.314 --> 08:03.021
There is one more thing.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.451
He's in too good of shape.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.746
We need to get him
to the point he
was at last night.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.584
Don't look at me,
but if you want to.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.786
Cute,

08:25.130 --> 08:26.995
but I didn't mean
physical stress.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.712
Don't you guys think
this is irresponsible?

08:30.803 --> 08:34.341
It's like you
getting two women pregnant
at the same time.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.673
ljust mean the part about
the Odds of it happening.

08:37.768 --> 08:38.928
They had to be
incredibly high.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.260
And if we induce V-fib,

08:41.438 --> 08:43.053
Odds say that we'll
be able to revive him,

08:43.190 --> 08:44.771
but there's always
a chance we can't.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.192
It's extreme and reckless.
That's House.
You get used to it.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.359
Or I fire you.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.359
Look what I found.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.075
Kiddie-winkies.
I wonder who they belong to.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.447
Give me my kids.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.697
NO, l genuinely
wonder who they belong to.

09:00.791 --> 09:01.906
I need a DNA sample.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.377
I'm not letting
you DNA test my kids.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.622
I already did.
This swab's for you.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.670
Fine, if you don't
mind paying a fortune

09:12.803 --> 09:14.919
in child support for
some other guy's kids?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.844
NO skin cells Off my cheek.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.639
CHI: His heart rate's
finally elevating.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.348
Dr. Chase said
you had something
to tell me?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.812
We were talking
about how you got
the abrasions on your knees.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.723
The flag football game?

09:27.818 --> 09:28.807
Oh, um...

09:29.486 --> 09:31.272
Yeah,
honey, I'm gonna need you
to let the guys know

09:31.363 --> 09:33.319
I'm not gonna be able
to play on Saturday.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.614
The whole town knows
that you're in the hospital.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.816
I wouldn't worry about it.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.158
That's not what you
wanted to tell her.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.244
You said
the game wasn't typical.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.656
Something happened
that you were upset about.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.704
I don't understand.
What are you...

09:47.921 --> 09:50.173
I don't...
I don't feel very...

09:50.340 --> 09:51.329
(MACHINE BEEPING)

09:53.010 --> 09:54.250
What's happening?

09:57.681 --> 09:59.387
It's not his heart.
/ know.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.013
He’s having a seizure.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.032
There wasn't any
abnormal electrical activity

10:23.207 --> 10:25.368
in his EKG when
the seizure occurred.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.949
It wasn't caused by V-fib.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.124
We still can't rule it out.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.043
His EKG from the ER.
documented it.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.628
Myocarditis?

10:31.715 --> 10:33.455
Viral infection
weakening the wall muscles.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.131
We'd need to biopsy
his heart to confirm.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.551
Myocarditis
wouldn't cause a seizure.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.299
Could be genetic.
Brugada syndrome?

10:42.434 --> 10:43.674
Oh, my God.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.265
Two prodigal sons.
Come on, let's hug it out.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.853
You really like
the idea or you just

10:50.567 --> 10:51.773
It's a stupid idea.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.146
We would have seen
evidence of Brugada
in the EKG.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.728
You know, this is...

10:55.864 --> 10:59.732
It's just messing
with my feng shui here.
What about over there?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.824
A pheochromocytoma?

11:01.912 --> 11:07.532
Excess adrenaline can cause
heart problems and seizures.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.033
Boﬂng.
I'm sorry.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.960
I thought I was here
to treat the patients,
not entertain you.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.207
Would it hurt to do both?

11:17.094 --> 11:19.335
This is much better.

I said it was boring,
I didn't say it was wrong.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.675
SO I'm right?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.177
Nope, you're wrong.
Photic epilepsy.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.806
It's equally boring,
but it has the advantage
of possibly being right.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.102
Give him an EEG to confirm.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.952
If you ever hear me mention
anything about wanting kids,

please feel free to
punch me in the liver.

He hasn't asked
me for anything,

he's been
incredibly well behaved,

12:01.597 --> 12:02.882
he's doing his clinic hours.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.338
That is a sign of concern.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.725
You know him as well as I do.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.800
He needs to
constantly establish
he's the alpha dog.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.011
He's got his team back,
he's got his Office back,

12:10.105 --> 12:12.266
he's got everything he needs.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.349
You really believe that?
He's content?

I don't want to let
House sabotage himself
by sabotaging me.

And I need your guidance
and your trust to do that.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.574
(CHUCKLES)
No,no,no.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.652
Cuddy had
a problem with House,
she came to me.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.830
Wanted to vent, me.
How did that turn out?

12:29.958 --> 12:34.577
You have a problem
with House, deal with it,
or find someone else who can.

12:38.550 --> 12:42.418
We're sorry about earlier,
but we needed to
provoke a reaction.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.501
It worked.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.005
I can barely look her
in the eyes anymore.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.015
I'd want my husband
to tell me the truth.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.091
CHASE: Sure.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.936
You'll feel better,
and she'll feel what?

12:53.065 --> 12:55.431
Devastated,
betrayed, heartbroken.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.731
You really want
to do that to her?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.945
NO.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.270
But I can't live like this.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.279
But she can.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.486
All set.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.444
All right,
we need you to sit back
and try to relax.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.786
Just look at the light.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.877
CHI: What exactly are they
building back there?

13:25.389 --> 13:27.300
A dream.
The EEG didn't show

13:27.391 --> 13:28.972
any abnormal brain activity.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.344
He doesn't have
photic epilepsy.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.391
I know, because he has
a pheochromocytoma.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.468
You said I was wrong.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.690
You were wrong
not to rule out
epilepsy first.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.230
That only takes
a couple of hours.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.270
Finding a tumor
that's flushing adrenaline
through his system

13:39.403 --> 13:40.483
is gonna take all night.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.776
Monitor his brain activity,

13:41.863 --> 13:44.400
start a continuous
urine test and blood
draws every two hours.

13:44.491 --> 13:48.029
I can't, I have my kids.
Wilson's leaving in,
like, 15 minutes.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.109
Chase and Adams
can do the tests.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.281
Thank you.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.918
For the massage bed.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.918
You and Park are
checking the motel
he was bumping uglies at

14:02.009 --> 14:03.795
for environmental factors.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.183
He couldn't find
a babysitter. Get over it.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.731
You're gonna get us killed.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.479
She thinks I'm
a prostitute on her turf.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.317
Showing weakness is
what gets you killed.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.778
Why would she think
you're a prostitute?

14:24.865 --> 14:26.947
I'm in a dump with a guy
almost twice my age.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.110
What else is she gonna think?

14:29.619 --> 14:31.120
How old do you think I am?

14:46.470 --> 14:48.085
SO who cheated on you?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.379
We just met.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.007
Don't you think
it's a little early
to be dragging up our baggage

14:54.102 --> 14:55.967
in front of each other?

14:56.063 --> 14:58.019
Who says I have baggage?

14:59.483 --> 15:02.691
I know when
House went to prison,
you quit medicine.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.393
You don't do that, unless...

15:04.529 --> 15:06.144
I didn't quit,
I took a vacation.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.112
I knew when he got out,
I'd get myjob back.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.158
House didn't even
know he was coming back.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.530
I had faith.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.450
Now that has baggage
stamped all over it.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.584
Seizure activity?

15:21.671 --> 15:24.208
NO, one of
the sensors came loose.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.709
|'|| fix it.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.343
What is it?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.226
Not a pheochromocytoma.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.442
CHASE: Our patient now has
a mass in his neck

15:46.530 --> 15:48.896
and his body
temp's been rising
over the last three hours.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.366
Where's the construction crew?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.032
Well, I'm not gonna make
them work day and night.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.571
SO I chose night.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.784
And his urine and blood tests
didn't show any evidence

15:57.874 --> 15:59.785
of an adrenaline
secreting tumor.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.868
Meningitis? We can do
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.746
Sorry,
I had to drop my kids Off
at day care across town.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.383
What'd I miss?
It's not meningitis.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.254
His neck isn't stiff
and his mental
status is normal.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.755
HOUSE: He's only guessing.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.258
I'm talking to Taub.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.385
He can't say "my kids"
until he lets me test him.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.143
SO tell me
about the love shack
where he cheated on his bride.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.811
The quarters came in handy.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.560
My kids loved the massage bed.

16:24.860 --> 16:29.980
Lab tests show
the bed tested
positive for, uh, semen,

16:30.073 --> 16:33.565
vaginal secretions,
saliva and fecal matter,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.901
both human and animal.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.411
You probably want
to boil the kids

16:38.540 --> 16:39.746
for a couple of
hours when you get home.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.786
The bathroom also
tested positive for

16:41.918 --> 16:43.829
five different types
of pathogenic bacteria.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.081
Fusobacterium necrophorum
was one of them.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.663
Yeah. How did you know?

16:47.757 --> 16:48.883
The bulge in his neck.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.669
The bacteria colonized
his parapharyngeal space,

16:53.763 --> 16:56.049
moved into his jugular vein
causing a thrombus.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.096
Lemierre's Syndrome.
Treat with amoxicillin
and clavulanic acid.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.845
Dig out the clot
before it moves to
his lungs and kills him.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.750
You got at least
a trillion cells.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.797
You're gonna misplace
one of them eventually.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.966
I have to tell
my wife the truth.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.224
There's plenty
of time for that
after the Operation.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.848
What if I die?
And one day she finds
out I cheated on her.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.726
I'll never be able to explain.
Never tell her how sorry I am.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.649
You're increasing
the Odds of that
every second we waste here.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.899
NO,
I'm not agreeing to anything
until I talk to her.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.905
BOY: Daddy!

17:56.117 --> 17:57.618
Hey!

17:59.412 --> 18:01.198
Hey, guys.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.038
Ew! Your neck looks
really gross.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.743
I missed you both so much,
but I need to
ask you a favor.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.079
I need to talk to
Mommy alone for a second.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.707
Would you mind
watching them for us?

18:20.183 --> 18:21.172
Um...

18:25.730 --> 18:27.106
This guy's an idiot.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.521
I think he actually
has a good point.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.773
What would you think
if you found out, years later,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.317
your beloved dead
wife cheated on you?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.519
I wouldn't believe it.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.570
As long as I don't
hear it directly from her,

18:40.036 --> 18:43.199
then I can hang on to
hope that it's not true.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.374
But this way,

18:47.836 --> 18:50.043
she has to either
dump him or forgive him.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.463
Guys, get your stuff.
We're leaving.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.378
I'm so sorry.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.176
I'll be back.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.098
I'm gonna drop our
kids Off at my mother's.

19:05.937 --> 19:11.022
Look, he made a mistake.
A stupid, horrible mistake.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.642
But we'll get through this.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.900
All I care about right now
is that my
husband gets better.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.658
Sorry about yesterday.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.660
House was like Child Catcher
from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.120
Why is he so Obsessed with
my kids being my kids?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.048
Because he sees insecurity,

19:37.135 --> 19:39.342
and when House
senses weakness,
he pounces.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.044
And because his
insecurity is the fact

19:41.181 --> 19:42.796
that other
people can have faith

19:42.932 --> 19:45.799
and don't have
the Obsessive need
for physical proof.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.762
Also, he started
a betting pool

19:49.898 --> 19:52.605
on which kid is
yours and which isn't.
(CHUCKLES)

20:01.701 --> 20:05.285
An entire hospital betting on
the legitimacy of my kids.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.702
It's great to be
back among friends.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.308
I'm not the bad guy here.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.310
I'm betting on
them both being yours.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.859
I would have donated
the money to charity.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.782
CHASE: Approaching the clot,
stand by for...

20:50.333 --> 20:52.039
JESSICA: That's not a clot.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.374
CHASE: It's his lymph nodes.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.621
The bulge wasn't
caused by pus or blood.
It's tissue inflammation.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.956
How could there
be that much...
Lymphoma.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.845
We need to take a biopsy.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.682
(BEEPING)

21:13.773 --> 21:15.058
CHASE: Did I nick something?
JESSICA: I don't know.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.515
CHASE: I don't see any
bleeding in here.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.522
JESSICA: His sclera
is jaundiced.
I think it's his liver.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.198
It's failing.

21:28.037 --> 21:32.371
We did a major
Operation for no reason.
It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.667
We would have had to biopsy
his lymph nodes
anyway to check for cancer.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.005
Which it's not,
biopsy was clean.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.546
We could be dealing with
an alcoholic going
through withdrawal.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.591
Explains his heart,
seizures and liver failing.

21:43.678 --> 21:46.636
HOUSE: But not his
swollen lymph nodes.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.429
CHI: Why are we
stealing cable
from here?

21:48.558 --> 21:50.264
We don't even have
a TV in our Office.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.889
I'm an ex-con trying
to adjust to a world
that's passed me by.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.096
Stealing's all I know.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.682
And the fact that
I was right about
what's wrong with our patient,

21:58.776 --> 22:00.732
just wrong about what.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.946
He means it's not Lemierre's,
but it's still an infection,

22:05.033 --> 22:06.398
which is why it's
spreading so rapidly.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.568
Cultures take time
and his liver
doesn't have much left.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.072
That's why we're
gonna blast him

22:11.206 --> 22:12.616
with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

22:12.707 --> 22:16.325
The blast will fry
what's left of his liver.
The cure will kill him.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.955
Not if we get him
a liver transplant first

22:18.087 --> 22:19.623
and then treat him
with the broad-spectrum.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.837
And old team for the win.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.257
Not that I'm keeping score.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.177
It's more of a grid where
l assign numerical
values that determine

22:28.264 --> 22:32.348
who gets raises,
vacation time
and my respect.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.598
We have him on
the donor list for a liver,
but these things take time.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.274
SO he could die
before he gets one?

22:42.403 --> 22:45.145
JESSICA: It's a possibility,
but we have another Option.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.947
We can do
a partial liver transplant
from a living donor.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.404
I'll do it.
CHASE: If you're a match,

22:50.495 --> 22:52.235
but to increase our odds,
we'd like to

22:52.372 --> 22:54.112
get your friends and
family tested, as well.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.326
(SIGHS) Is it safe?

22:57.377 --> 22:59.242
It's a major surgery.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.952
Donorspends
a week in the hospital

23:01.089 --> 23:02.954
and up to three months
convalescing at home.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.956
I can't ask someone
to do that for me.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.175
There are hundreds of people
who would do that for you.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.503
Because they don't
know the real me.

23:09.806 --> 23:13.014
You are a good man
who made a mistake.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.974
Then I have to
tell them first.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.398
I have to live with this, too.

23:23.653 --> 23:27.487
I know. And I'm sorry,

23:27.574 --> 23:31.032
but this is the only
way that I can do this.

24:12.035 --> 24:15.277
Before I ask any of you
to sacrifice three
months of your life for me,

24:15.371 --> 24:16.451
I have a confession.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.581
I had an affair.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.741
(PEOPLE MUMBLING)

24:22.462 --> 24:24.248
I cheated on Denise.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.255
I wouldn't blame
anyone if you decide...

24:28.343 --> 24:29.674
lforgive him.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.092
That should be
enough for all of us.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.004
Thank you so much
for coming here...

24:34.098 --> 24:35.929
There's more.

24:41.731 --> 24:46.475
Larry, that new transmission
I put in your truck,

24:46.569 --> 24:47.900
you didn't need it.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.486
Joe, same thing with
the engine rebuild.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.865
In fact, I cheated
most of you here tonight.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.248
Half the time
you bring your cars
into my garage,

25:02.335 --> 25:04.747
there's nothing
wrong with them.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.579
I've been ripping
you all Off for years.

25:11.094 --> 25:15.133
I also took $10,000 from
the Harvest Scholarship Fund

25:15.390 --> 25:17.927
and I lost it gambling.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.301
I'm sorry.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.933
I'm not the man
you thought I was.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.450
That went over well.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.909
Out of the two donors
who didn't walk out,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.283
both were negative
for a potential match.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.084
Telling the truth
may have just
killed this guy.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.707
I told him to tell
his wife he cheated,

25:48.798 --> 25:50.754
not confess every sin
he's ever committed.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.466
If everybody did that,
we'd never find
a donor for anyone again.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.714
Everybody doesn't lie,
cheat or steal
from their friends.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.136
Yeah, they do.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.880
Maybe not as much as this guy,

25:59.976 --> 26:01.136
but if people told
nothing but the truth,

26:01.227 --> 26:02.808
the world would probably
burn down over night.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.763
Some people think
it's burning now.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.849
Maybe if
everybody didn't lie...

26:08.943 --> 26:11.059
HOUSE: Aww, that is cute.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.102
I'm talking
about your breasts.

26:13.781 --> 26:17.273
They always get perky
when you're being
painfully earnest.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.067
Truth.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.780
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

26:21.497 --> 26:24.910
More truth, I only noticed
because Chase was
staring at them.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.750
He'd never admit it
because he doesn't
want to Offend you.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.122
Same reason
he'd never tell you

26:29.255 --> 26:30.540
that he's thought
about having sex with you.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.337
Although, to be fair,
every man you've ever met

26:32.425 --> 26:34.290
has thought about
having sex with you.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.671
They'll lie,
because if you knew,

26:36.804 --> 26:38.965
you probably
wouldn't want to
have sex with them.

26:39.056 --> 26:42.139
And that's just
some of the lies
from the last minute.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.600
And here's a bigger one.

26:44.687 --> 26:45.802
You already know this,

26:46.063 --> 26:48.725
but you pretend you don't
because it makes
you feel civilized.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.233
Most people find it
easier to ignore the truth.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.693
Ask Taub.

26:54.822 --> 26:58.110
Our patient can't
wait for a transplant
that's never gonna come.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.066
We need to get
reckless and extreme.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.035
CT his liver,
find the damaged area
and cut it out.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.496
Hopefully what's
left will be enough

27:05.583 --> 27:08.370
so we can start
treatment with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.042
I'm sorry the first time I had
both of you together,
I had to work.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.172
But Daddy's boss is
what we call a jackass.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.722
It's Okay. Stay right there.

27:31.943 --> 27:34.309
I'm also sorry

27:35.404 --> 27:38.567
for what I'm about to do

27:42.245 --> 27:46.784
because nothing
will ever change
how I feel about you guys.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.926
But Daddy is weak
and needs to know.

28:05.726 --> 28:09.184
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this right here, Okay?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.190
It's 3:30 in the morning.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.275
Why are you still here?

28:24.370 --> 28:25.610
House is here.

28:25.746 --> 28:26.952
And apparently
prepping for an operation

28:27.123 --> 28:28.363
that will
probably kill a patient.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.448
I wouldn't be
doing this if I thought
there was another way.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.283
There is.
He needs a transplant.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.539
You have one lying around?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.746
'Cause he'll be dead
if he doesn't get one
in the next few hours.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.918
That falls under
natural causes.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.382
If you kill him,
we're looking at...

28:40.469 --> 28:41.549
Dead is dead.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.252
Not as far as our
lawyers are concerned.

28:45.433 --> 28:46.468
I'm not being a click.

28:47.059 --> 28:50.096
This is a real issue
and I have to worry
about the big picture now.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.176
I don't.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.020
I'll be doing what
you would have done
a year ago.

28:54.609 --> 28:55.894
I'll be in surgery.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.395
Chase?
You need to
check this out.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.858
This is his CT
scan of his liver
from 10 hours ago.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.323
This is from now.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.579

he was telling her about

29:20.676 --> 29:23.053
the strippers from
his bachelor party.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.219
Liver function
has improved 30%.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.013
It buys us a few extra days
before he'll
need a transplant.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.637
Interesting question is,
"Why is it regenerating?"

29:39.403 --> 29:41.439
And scene.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.522
Now we're back to
boring reality, reality.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.448
His liver was in shock before.

29:46.535 --> 29:49.151
He's been having
an allergic reaction
since he got here.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.111
It would explain
why his symptoms
appeared so rapidly.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.322
And maybe it's
starting to go away.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.407
We need to run a scratch test
to find out what set it Off.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.958
Or who.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.876
This all started when
he cheated on his wife.

29:58.673 --> 30:00.709
He's allergic to a person?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.089
Or something she's wearing.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.926
Makeup, perfume,

30:20.987 --> 30:23.569
Or something
you wear, own, use
or gave him.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.155
I gave him a condom.
He didn't have one.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.231

to be the good cop.

might help save his life.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.172
I tested with
the wheat allergy swab,

32:07.259 --> 32:09.875
but none of his blood samples
shows he's allergic to it.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.176
Then he's not allergic to it.

have somehow caused it?

32:17.186 --> 32:18.926
it was gluten
before we closed him.

Could be a latex allergy.

positive for that either.

test positive for anything.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.015
Stop.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.024
Let me see them.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.793
Just wanted to make sure
all three were inside.

39:13.894 --> 39:14.883
(DOOR SLIDING OPEN)

39:28.492 --> 39:30.323
DENISE: The mayor checked.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.909
There wasn't any money missing
from the scholarship fund.

39:33.455 --> 39:36.947
Dr. Chase told me
about your disease,

39:37.876 --> 39:40.413
how it made you
confess to crimes
you hadn't committed.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.304
The affair with that girl,

39:57.437 --> 39:58.472
is that real?

40:02.359 --> 40:03.849
Honey,L”

40:12.536 --> 40:15.528
...would never,
have never cheated on you.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.750
(SOBBING)

40:22.838 --> 40:24.669
I knew you could
never do that to me.

40:25.173 --> 40:28.006
I don't know how,
but I knew.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.693
Glad to see taking a year Off
didn't dull your skill set.

40:47.779 --> 40:48.985
I got lucky.

40:51.575 --> 40:52.564
About the other night,

40:53.535 --> 40:55.696
I have enough
problems with this job.

40:56.038 --> 40:58.700
Second guessing
my best doctors
shouldn't be one of them.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.458
Why are you up here?

41:03.545 --> 41:05.206
You have your own
bathroom and Office now.

41:05.297 --> 41:09.540
To shower.
lhaventleﬁ
the hospital in four days.

41:09.635 --> 41:10.966
VVhy?

41:11.053 --> 41:12.714
House won't go home
and there's no way

41:12.846 --> 41:14.507
I'm leaving him
here unsupervised.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.812
House is screwing with you.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.566
By not screwing with you.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.566
He's watching TV
and drinking
martinis all night.

41:32.783 --> 41:34.398
Meanwhile,
he's keeping you here

41:34.534 --> 41:36.661
searching for a plan
that doesn't even exist.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.531
How the hell did
I not see that?

41:49.508 --> 41:50.714
I'm glad you're back.

41:52.803 --> 41:54.134
Me, too.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.102
Either a hot tub or a sauna.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.275
A hot tub would be cool.

42:11.113 --> 42:13.445
HOUSE: New team, old team,

42:14.324 --> 42:17.612
I present phase one

42:17.703 --> 42:20.695
of Operation Outer Office 2.0.

42:30.132 --> 42:31.542
Nothing's changed.

42:34.469 --> 42:36.380
Oh, everything has changed.

43:01.830 --> 43:02.990
NO.
