00:10.400 --> 00:12.680
One-Tango-13 in pursuit
of car jackers…

00:12.720 --> 00:15.822
<i>eastbound on Campo,
approaching Melrose.</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:18.400
<i>Oh, shit. They're bailing.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.960
<i>One-tango-13. My partner's
on foot pursuit.</i>

00:26.000 --> 00:29.960
<i>1300 block of Pico.
Additional backup requested.</i>

00:30.080 --> 00:31.640
Suspects are armed.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.800
I've got 'im. Go.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.702
One-Tango-13.
We have the child. He's unharmed.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.560
Stop!

00:58.640 --> 01:00.400
He's in there.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

01:16.320 --> 01:18.440
Freeze!

01:19.800 --> 01:22.240
Stop!

01:26.315 --> 01:28.435
Stay down.
Hands behind your back.

01:28.475 --> 01:31.955
You're under arrest.

01:32.115 --> 01:34.315
They took the skin from his ass.

01:34.435 --> 01:36.217
Left cheek and upper thigh.

01:36.355 --> 01:39.635
Those jokes just write themselves.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.555
I'm ready to come back.

01:43.195 --> 01:46.515
–You should take some more time.
–All I can think about…

01:46.555 --> 01:49.075
is ripping off these Armenians.

01:49.235 --> 01:52.395
–You up to work and the money train?
–I need this.

01:52.435 --> 01:54.675
He's come up
with a new way inside.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.595
It's a little late
for changes in the game plan.

01:56.635 --> 01:59.635
<i>I went two nights ago,
scoped out the whole location again.</i>

01:59.675 --> 02:03.235
The one thing we've never been able
to figure out is the bottleneck problem.

02:03.275 --> 02:04.995
<i>All four of us going in together…</i>

02:05.035 --> 02:07.355
if just one of those Armenians
isn't where we expect him to be…

02:07.395 --> 02:10.195
–Yeah, we're toast.
–Ronnie noticed this
garbage pickup at the site.

02:10.235 --> 02:12.611
It's Armenian.
They just wave it in.

02:12.635 --> 02:16.275
We get ahold of the garbage truck,
deposit two of us on the inside…

02:16.315 --> 02:17.915
a few hours before
the money train arrives.

02:17.955 --> 02:20.115
<i>Me and Shane,
we climb inside a Dumpster…</i>

02:20.155 --> 02:23.635
–Why am I in the garbage?
–Two inside, two outside.

02:23.675 --> 02:27.515
We triangulate.
Sounds like a real possibility.

02:27.795 --> 02:31.035
Have to figure out how to get our hands
on one of those garbage trucks.

02:31.075 --> 02:33.155
We're already on it.

02:33.275 --> 02:36.179
We only have two weeks
to master a new plan.

02:37.195 --> 02:38.915
Let me think about it.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.395
Goddamn it.

02:42.995 --> 02:44.875
You're not talking about me, I hope.

02:44.915 --> 02:48.155
–What do you want?
–Everything okay?

02:48.315 --> 02:51.115
<i>The Times is gonna endorse
Karen Mitchell for city council primary.</i>

02:51.155 --> 02:54.355
–So? Don't you have some big lead?
–Not anymore.

02:54.955 --> 02:57.595
And with Lanie's official report due
a week before the election…

02:57.635 --> 03:00.115
Yeah, well…

03:00.155 --> 03:03.395
I was thinking about some ways
to take the sting out of that report.

03:03.435 --> 03:05.635
Enlighten me.

03:05.795 --> 03:07.275
One big, high-profile bust…

03:07.315 --> 03:10.549
something the chief…
not even Lanie… can deny us.

03:13.229 --> 03:16.469
–And I suppose you have a candidate.
–Fresh off the Teletype.

03:16.509 --> 03:20.989
Dante Fell. He was a major gangbanger
when I was in the blues.

03:21.189 --> 03:24.069
He went national,
went off my radar.

03:24.069 --> 03:27.469
F.B.I, D.E.A, State, County,
they all want him bad.

03:27.909 --> 03:31.389
How sweet would it be
if we dragged his ass in?

03:31.589 --> 03:33.989
Scored one for the home team?

03:34.149 --> 03:36.109
Federal authorities
believe Dante Fell…

03:36.149 --> 03:40.229
may be on his way to Farmington
or already here.

03:40.389 --> 03:43.469
Dante is a founding member
of the Compton Crowns street gang.

03:43.509 --> 03:47.029
<i>He spent the last four years of his life
franchising his gang to other places…</i>

03:47.069 --> 03:49.309
<i>like Wichita, San Antonio
and Oklahoma City…</i>

03:49.349 --> 03:52.069
supplying them
with drugs and weapons.

03:52.229 --> 03:55.709
Pick up a flyer
and be on the lookout for him.

03:57.429 --> 03:59.949
–Think you can get him before the feds?
–Absolutely.

03:59.989 --> 04:03.487
–Listen, I gotta bring Ronnie back.
–Sure he's ready?

04:03.589 --> 04:05.989
–Yeah, I'm sure.
–I'm not.

04:05.989 --> 04:08.429
Tavon's still learning.
I need a full team.

04:08.469 --> 04:10.629
This guy Dante isn't
gonna be an easy catch.

04:10.669 --> 04:13.789
Fine. I don't want you
to have any excuses.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.669
I won't need any.

04:23.269 --> 04:26.149
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

04:26.149 --> 04:28.349
Read about that civilian
auditor's report.

04:28.389 --> 04:31.469
–It was pretty rough.
–What's up?

04:31.509 --> 04:34.469
–When you had me running
that protective detail on Corrine?
–Yeah?

04:34.509 --> 04:36.909
I saw my guy's surveillance notes,
and he followed her…

04:36.949 --> 04:39.869
to some law firm on Ventura,
so I looked into it.

04:39.909 --> 04:42.869
She went to see
a divorce lawyer. Twice.

04:42.909 --> 04:47.463
–And you're just telling me this now?
–I didn't confirm it until now.

04:47.949 --> 04:50.989
Divorce lawyer.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.829
<i>–We're not anywhere near that.
–I'm just telling you, Vic.</i>

04:53.869 --> 04:57.389
It's a mistake I'll always regret,
not seeing the writing on the wall.

04:57.429 --> 05:00.349
We're supposed to be
in a holding pattern
till we figure things out.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.269
She's already seen
this lawyer twice.

05:02.309 --> 05:05.477
She's scheduled to see him again
Tuesday, 4 p.m.

05:05.669 --> 05:07.989
–She wouldn't do this to me, not right now.
–I bet you didn't think…

05:08.029 --> 05:12.709
she was capable of packing up and running out
with your kids, and she did.

05:12.749 --> 05:15.709
Listen, please, just do me a favor.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.709
–Talk to this guy of mine.
–Divorce guy?

05:19.229 --> 05:20.989
He's one of the best.

05:24.629 --> 05:28.787
I really appreciate the heads-up
on this, but it's unnecessary.

05:32.269 --> 05:35.829
–Tavon Garris, right?
–That's me.

05:36.029 --> 05:38.069
I'm Lanie Kellis.

05:38.189 --> 05:40.549
Oh, sure, your, uh…

05:40.589 --> 05:42.949
Your report's causing quite a stir
around here.

05:42.989 --> 05:46.429
<i>That was a mistake.
Someone leaked my notes.</i>

05:46.549 --> 05:49.069
My official report
comes out next week.

05:49.109 --> 05:51.949
Being new, I'm probably the only person in the
building not sweating it, huh?

05:51.989 --> 05:54.349
<i>Well, I know everybody here
sees me as the bogeyman…</i>

05:54.389 --> 05:58.109
but if you ask me,
I'm misunderstood.

05:59.709 --> 06:03.229
<i>I've been meaning
to talk to you actually.</i>

06:03.349 --> 06:07.069
<i>–Yeah? What about?
–Vic Mackey.</i>

06:11.189 --> 06:13.433
<i>Mmm, look at the patch man.</i>

06:13.589 --> 06:15.669
Back in the saddle, baby.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.269
<i>Listen, you get ahold of that thing
we were talking about?</i>

06:18.309 --> 06:20.509
<i>I'm open to the new plan.</i>

06:21.869 --> 06:23.869
<i>–Get going, then.
–All right.</i>

06:23.909 --> 06:26.549
Call in with updates
and keep 'em open.

06:28.349 --> 06:31.629
Hey. You seen Tavon around?

06:31.789 --> 06:33.989
Not in the last half hour. Why?

06:34.229 --> 06:37.109
<i>I saw him chatting up with Lanie
in the kitchen earlier.</i>

06:37.149 --> 06:39.229
<i>–What were they saying?
–I couldn't hear…</i>

06:39.269 --> 06:41.629
but they looked awful cozy.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.869
Now, the last thing we need
is another guy we can't trust.

06:44.909 --> 06:46.429
Yo.

06:46.469 --> 06:49.571
Hey, I saw you talking
to our civilian auditor.

06:49.669 --> 06:51.509
Yeah.
What's up with her?

06:51.549 --> 06:54.651
She's a bitch.
What were you two talking about?

06:56.349 --> 06:58.429
<i>–Nothing, really.
–Keep it that way.</i>

06:58.469 --> 07:01.069
Let's get started on finding
this Dante prick.

07:01.109 --> 07:03.029
Come on.
It's a needle in a haystack.

07:03.069 --> 07:05.869
I mean, according to the Teletype,
the guy might be in town?

07:05.909 --> 07:10.109
For reasons either the feds don't know
or don't want to reveal, it's a jerk-off.

07:10.149 --> 07:12.949
What?
You giving up already?

07:13.149 --> 07:16.429
Actually, we do have a bona fide tip
that the feds don't have.

07:16.469 --> 07:20.509
–Yeah, what's that?
–One of Dante's old homies is Kern Little.

07:20.549 --> 07:23.589
<i>–The hip-hop guy?
–Yeah, they got picked up
a few times together.</i>

07:23.629 --> 07:26.429
Knowing Kern,
he stays in touch.

07:26.629 --> 07:29.469
What makes you think
Kern's gonna help us?

07:29.629 --> 07:31.309
Kern's a friend.

07:31.349 --> 07:34.469
Grab your shit.
You're riding with us today.

07:34.509 --> 07:37.017
Looks like I'm moving up
in the world.

07:56.469 --> 07:59.229
<i>Hey.</i>

08:01.528 --> 08:04.848
A'ight. I see you're adding
a little color to the team.

08:04.888 --> 08:07.368
<i>–Tavon, man. It's good to meet you.
–We're here for a favor.</i>

08:07.408 --> 08:10.568
<i>–Funny. I need one from you.
–Mine first. Dante Fell.</i>

08:10.608 --> 08:12.488
I hear he's in town.
What can you tell me?

08:12.528 --> 08:15.300
Man, I ain't seen
Dante in, like, forever.

08:15.408 --> 08:19.288
–But you know who he hangs with, right?
–When we getting to my favor?

08:19.328 --> 08:21.328
Soon.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.888
All right. If he's in L.A….

08:25.088 --> 08:26.648
You want to be
talking to Frogger.

08:26.688 --> 08:29.488
Real name Freddy Germaine,
Dante's quarter brother.

08:29.528 --> 08:32.368
<i>Quarter brother? That some
kind of new ghetto math?</i>

08:32.408 --> 08:35.967
<i>Nah, man. It means Dante's moms was
shacked up with Froggy's pops.</i>

08:36.008 --> 08:38.408
Pops took off.
Dante's moms kept Froggy.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.648
–So you know, they're not
blood brothers, they're…
–Quarter brothers.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.847
Exactly. So, what's up
with my favor?

08:46.728 --> 08:49.808
<i>–You like that studio stuff, huh?
–It's hot, man.</i>

08:49.848 --> 08:52.248
Why don't you give him
a tour of the place, baby?

08:52.288 --> 08:54.408
Sure. Let me
show you around.

09:03.848 --> 09:06.288
So here's the deal, man.

09:06.328 --> 09:09.888
I'm trying to get back into the drug game.
I need y'all on my team, though.

09:09.928 --> 09:11.928
Same deal you had
with Rondell and Tio.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.728
That wasn't working out for us
the way we'd hoped. I can't help you.

09:15.768 --> 09:18.606
Being kind of cold
for someone who owes me.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.488
–Owe you for what?
–I was getting a cut from Rondell.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.448
Y'all wanted him out.
I went along with it.

09:23.488 --> 09:25.488
Y'all was supposed to
be protecting Tio.

09:25.528 --> 09:28.648
He goes up in smoke.
Suddenly, my cut dries up.

09:28.768 --> 09:31.208
Look, I didn't come to y'all for lost wages,
but y'all know I could've.

09:31.248 --> 09:33.448
Well, it looks like
you're scraping by.

09:33.488 --> 09:35.848
Well, I'm not.
Man, I got lawsuits…

09:36.048 --> 09:38.292
cheating accountants,
hungry crew.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.888
You're broke?

09:41.088 --> 09:45.368
Not if I could fill the powder void
in Farmington. I need y'all, though.

09:45.408 --> 09:48.288
We got pressures
of our own right now.

09:48.448 --> 09:52.088
It'd make it impossible
for us to do what you ask.

09:52.288 --> 09:54.488
<i>I appreciate
the Frogger tip…</i>

09:54.528 --> 09:57.488
but I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to make it up to you.

09:57.528 --> 10:00.768
–That's it?
–That's it. Tavon!

10:03.808 --> 10:05.648
Good work.
Keep it up.

10:05.848 --> 10:07.568
Two for one, man.
Unbelievable.

10:07.608 --> 10:11.436
Yeah. Store owner says
we're gonna lose Julien to the NFL.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.248
<i>Julien, isn't that your…</i>

10:20.408 --> 10:23.768
<i>Yeah. I got it.</i>

10:24.848 --> 10:26.528
What are you doing here?

10:26.768 --> 10:30.128
I'm out on parole.
I wanted to see you as soon as I…

10:30.168 --> 10:31.752
Now is not a great time.

10:31.888 --> 10:34.808
Okay, well, when would
be a good time then?

10:35.888 --> 10:39.254
Things have changed, Tomas.
Everything has changed.

10:39.488 --> 10:41.168
You've gotta leave.

10:41.368 --> 10:44.168
Look, I really need your help right now.
I got no one else…

10:44.208 --> 10:47.088
Look, I cannot
do this right now.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.888
Maybe later.

10:51.808 --> 10:54.168
Oh, goddamn it.
We've got a tail.

10:54.328 --> 10:56.688
<i>Don't look.</i>

10:56.848 --> 10:59.608
–You sure?
–Green sedan about three cars back.

10:59.648 --> 11:02.728
<i>Saw it on the way to Kern's.
He's still on our ass.</i>

11:02.768 --> 11:05.368
–Who'd stick a tail on us?
–That's what you're gonna find out.

11:05.408 --> 11:07.784
<i>All right.
Get ready to bail.</i>

11:11.368 --> 11:13.568
<i>Go, go.</i>

11:39.528 --> 11:42.488
–May I help you?
–My daughter Evette, she was raped.

11:42.528 --> 11:45.248
I'm sorry.
Has she seen a doctor yet?

11:45.408 --> 11:49.688
No. Uh, it happened a couple of days ago.
I just found out about it.

11:49.728 --> 11:54.612
Her boss had her close the store late with him,
so he could get her alone.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.408
<i>–You get the tag?
–Yeah.</i>

12:11.808 --> 12:14.568
–Write it down.
–It's cool, man. I got it right here.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.688
Unless you're the world
concentration champion…

12:16.728 --> 12:19.208
<i>just write down the damn tag number,
man, it's important.</i>

12:19.248 --> 12:22.168
Whoever he is,
he's still back there.

12:25.408 --> 12:27.288
Why do I have
to have these tests?

12:27.328 --> 12:30.648
Well, it may still give us a chance
to get a sample of his D.N.A.

12:30.688 --> 12:32.408
He wore a condom.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.608
<i>Well, it also proves
that intercourse took place.</i>

12:34.648 --> 12:39.488
Won't take long.
You're a brave girl to come forward.

12:39.888 --> 12:42.088
What is it?

12:45.408 --> 12:48.448
I have a boyfriend…
and we…

12:50.008 --> 12:54.034
–You had intercourse with your boyfriend?
–Mama doesn't know.

12:54.128 --> 12:57.408
When was the last time
you had sex?

12:57.488 --> 13:00.968
A few days ago.
Will that show up on the test?

13:01.248 --> 13:03.768
Let's just wait for the results.

13:03.928 --> 13:05.808
It's gonna be okay.

13:07.168 --> 13:11.008
<i>I'm the manager.</i>

13:11.008 --> 13:14.328
Hey, darling.
Uh, we're looking for Freddy.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.808
–Frogger?
–Yeah. Can you help us?

13:17.848 --> 13:20.648
<i>Ain't seen him today.
Why? Did he do something?</i>

13:20.688 --> 13:23.768
Well, have you seen this guy
hanging around lately?

13:23.808 --> 13:27.928
–No.
–Is there anything you can
tell us about Frogger?

13:28.128 --> 13:30.968
Always pays his rent late.
Not late enough to kick him out…

13:31.008 --> 13:34.648
<i>but late enough to make me take
an extra trip to the bank every month.</i>

13:34.688 --> 13:37.928
<i>–Has he paid up this month?
–Not yet. Four days late.</i>

13:37.968 --> 13:41.288
<i>–I hope he's okay in there.
–What do you mean?</i>

13:41.328 --> 13:44.408
Well, maybe he's sick
in there or something.

13:44.688 --> 13:47.368
Can't get to the phone.

13:47.568 --> 13:51.808
And as the manager, you could let us in,
just to see if he's okay.

13:51.848 --> 13:54.288
I mean, if you're worried
about him or anything.

13:54.328 --> 13:56.088
Should I be?

13:59.488 --> 14:01.208
Let me get my keys.

14:04.008 --> 14:07.568
–Leo wants to take a few shots for
the paper, then get a short interview.
–Great.

14:07.608 --> 14:11.688
–Actually, he just wants Julien.
–Sure.

14:13.928 --> 14:16.648
<i>–Here we go, smile.
–Julien, I really need to talk to you.</i>

14:16.688 --> 14:20.528
–I'm busy right now.
–It'll just take a second.

14:20.648 --> 14:22.408
Um, this is Tomas.
He's a friend.

14:22.448 --> 14:24.248
Heard about our hero, huh?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.448
Oh, yeah.
I knew him when.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.568
–Um, this is Vanessa, my wife.
–Hi.

14:31.728 --> 14:34.648
<i>–Ah. Congratulations.
–Thank you.</i>

14:36.288 --> 14:38.048
Please?

14:38.248 --> 14:40.328
Make it quick.

14:44.448 --> 14:48.088
–What are you doing?
–You said talk to you later. It's later.

14:48.128 --> 14:50.168
–Your wife looks incredible.
–What?

14:50.208 --> 14:53.768
Almost fooled me. Wait a minute.
You really married a woman?

14:53.808 --> 14:55.928
Watch your mouth.

14:56.088 --> 14:58.168
Wait, look, look. Julien.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.568
I got no place to stay, all right.
Can you help me out here?

15:01.608 --> 15:03.488
Look, I'm married now.
You can't stay with me.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.888
Married? Julien,
what about what we had?

15:06.928 --> 15:09.968
That's not who I am anymore.
I've said good-bye to that part of my life.

15:10.008 --> 15:11.888
Now I have to say
good-bye to you.

15:11.928 --> 15:15.448
Look, if you don't help me…

15:15.528 --> 15:18.248
you know what I'm gonna
have to do to survive?

15:18.288 --> 15:20.448
Is that what
you want for me?

15:20.488 --> 15:24.514
<i>–Julien, the photographer's ready for you.
–All right.</i>

15:25.968 --> 15:29.368
–You should go.
–I'll be there in a minute.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.728
If you don't want
to see me anymore, fine.

15:33.768 --> 15:36.368
But don't tell me you can't help me out,
because I know you can.

15:36.408 --> 15:38.048
Look!

15:38.048 --> 15:41.168
Get a hotel for
a few nights on me. Here.

15:41.568 --> 15:43.808
What kind of place takes cash?

15:44.088 --> 15:47.058
I need a credit card
if I'm gonna get a room.

15:48.688 --> 15:50.528
Here.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.568
All right, I'll bring
this back when I'm done.

15:52.608 --> 15:55.088
<i>Just go, please.</i>

15:56.408 --> 15:58.648
He's not dead in there, is he?

15:58.848 --> 16:00.568
No, ma'am.

16:03.648 --> 16:07.408
You have one saved message.

16:07.608 --> 16:09.928
<i>Hey, yo, Frogger, this Kern Little.
I'm boys with Dante.</i>

16:09.968 --> 16:13.448
<i>Yo, listen, bro, cops is looking for him.
They think you the key, man.</i>

16:13.488 --> 16:15.448
<i>They on their way over there.
You there?</i>

16:15.488 --> 16:18.448
<i>You better move your ass,
and don't tell 'em I told you.</i>

16:18.488 --> 16:21.408
–So what else was I supposed to do, man?
–Hey, look, I… I…

16:21.448 --> 16:23.768
I don't blame you.
You feel like we screwed you.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.184
–So you screwed us right back.
–Man!

16:26.328 --> 16:29.694
Listen, let's see if we can't
start all over again.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.568
I'm here, listening.

16:32.608 --> 16:37.096
All right. In our earlier conversation,
what I was trying to get at…

16:37.368 --> 16:40.008
is we made a mistake
in our previous business model.

16:40.048 --> 16:42.648
<i>We got in too deep.
Now, I just don't wanna…</i>

16:42.688 --> 16:45.088
make the same mistake
a second time.

16:45.248 --> 16:47.288
We both learning
from our mistakes.

16:47.328 --> 16:51.128
I can't do the same things I did for Rondell,
but I can provide some intel…

16:51.168 --> 16:54.006
eliminate some competition,
do some favors.

16:54.048 --> 16:58.008
–That's all I'm asking.
–I won't have the same room to maneuver…

16:58.048 --> 17:00.608
unless I double my arrest quota.

17:00.808 --> 17:03.168
I gotta get the big fish.

17:03.328 --> 17:06.568
Look, I put my ass on the line with my boss.
I told him I'd get Dante.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.848
We can help each other out,
but it's gotta start with you.

17:09.887 --> 17:13.386
I've always been straight with you,
Kern, every time.

17:13.768 --> 17:15.568
Yeah, I know.

17:17.968 --> 17:20.248
All right, man.

17:20.448 --> 17:23.167
I'll make some calls.

17:23.248 --> 17:26.568
I'll find out what pad
the Frogger landed on.

17:26.848 --> 17:28.568
I appreciate it.

17:28.768 --> 17:31.012
Why do you think
she'd accuse you?

17:31.128 --> 17:33.088
I don't know.

17:33.088 --> 17:36.328
I had to put Evette on notice last week.
It was her second warning.

17:36.368 --> 17:38.328
<i>–About what?
–Well, take your pick.</i>

17:38.368 --> 17:40.568
She's late all the time.
She, uh, could give…

17:40.608 --> 17:42.488
a rat's ass about
customer service.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.088
<i>Not exactly employee
of the month.</i>

17:44.128 --> 17:48.568
It's these girls. They take the job for the
discount and leave after six weeks.

17:48.608 --> 17:51.288
<i>As God is my witness,
I didn't touch her.</i>

17:51.328 --> 17:54.728
She says you told her she had to stay late
the other night.

17:54.768 --> 17:57.568
<i>Yeah, to… to help close up.
It's a two-person job.</i>

17:57.608 --> 17:59.984
So it was just
the two of you, then.

18:00.128 --> 18:05.328
We totaled the receipts and took out the trash
and locked up and left.

18:05.488 --> 18:07.528
I even walked her to her car.

18:07.648 --> 18:11.208
So, got any dish
on Lanie's report?

18:11.408 --> 18:12.928
No. What have you heard?

18:12.968 --> 18:15.344
Nothing.
Just major cuts are coming.

18:15.488 --> 18:17.528
Don't have to be psychic
to know that.

18:17.568 --> 18:20.048
You'll, uh, put in a good word
for me, right?

18:20.088 --> 18:22.408
<i>–With who?
–Lanie.</i>

18:22.568 --> 18:24.448
You better
put that one in yourself.

18:24.488 --> 18:27.722
–Come on. I've seen you two talking.
–Who's that?

18:32.088 --> 18:33.808
Can I help you?

18:34.008 --> 18:35.928
Uh, yes.
Um, an officer called me…

18:35.968 --> 18:38.288
about my husband,
asked me to come down here.

18:38.328 --> 18:41.648
–And your husband is…
–Bruce Rosen. What's going on?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.608
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
This is Detective Wyms.

18:43.648 --> 18:45.488
Why don't you take a seat?

18:45.688 --> 18:48.568
<i>–No. Just tell me, is my husband all right?
–Mrs Rosen…</i>

18:48.608 --> 18:53.162
your husband's been accused of
allegedly raping one of his employees.

18:53.248 --> 18:55.848
<i>What? That's ridiculous.</i>

18:55.888 --> 18:58.568
There been accusations
like that in the past?

18:58.608 --> 19:00.848
Of what, rape?

19:00.888 --> 19:03.608
Of course not. He's never
been arrested in his life.

19:03.648 --> 19:05.568
<i>–Do you have a daughter?
–Yes.</i>

19:05.608 --> 19:07.768
–How old is she?
–Fourteen.

19:07.808 --> 19:10.382
–We're gonna need to talk to her.
–Why?

19:10.648 --> 19:14.488
The alleged victim's 16. If your husband did
have forcible sex with her…

19:14.528 --> 19:17.688
sometimes there's a pattern
that extends to the family.
–That's sick.

19:17.728 --> 19:20.688
–It's procedure in these cases.
–Yeah, what's procedure?

19:20.728 --> 19:24.728
To lock up an innocent man
and attack his family?

19:25.088 --> 19:27.848
I want to see Bruce now.

19:34.328 --> 19:36.648
Okay. Little man's asleep.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.848
What's that?

19:39.008 --> 19:41.528
Uh, from Matthew's teacher.

19:41.728 --> 19:45.048
Progress report.
He's struggling.

19:45.088 --> 19:48.008
–He seems the same to me.
–Yeah, that's the problem.

19:48.048 --> 19:52.088
Oh, the roofer's coming Tuesday afternoon.
He's gonna give us a bid.

19:52.128 --> 19:54.728
Um, Tuesday's not good.
I have a school thing for Cassidy.

19:54.768 --> 19:57.008
School thing?

19:57.168 --> 19:59.968
Yeah, um, room mother meeting.

20:00.128 --> 20:02.648
Okay. I'll reschedule.

20:09.328 --> 20:12.648
She said she had a school meeting
on Tuesday. She lied.

20:12.688 --> 20:15.368
<i>That's not the only thing
she's lying about.</i>

20:15.408 --> 20:18.968
If you file first, then the settlement
proceeds on your terms.

20:19.008 --> 20:21.208
You get a much better shot
at more time with your kids…

20:21.248 --> 20:23.030
<i>maybe joint custody…</i>

20:23.168 --> 20:25.088
<i>makes you look like
the wronged party.</i>

20:25.128 --> 20:27.608
<i>–Wronged party?
–I gave him some of your details.</i>

20:27.648 --> 20:29.528
She took your kids without telling
you where she was going.

20:29.568 --> 20:33.368
<i>–She was scared.
–You call it scared. I call it kidnapping.</i>

20:33.408 --> 20:36.368
<i>Gordon Jr. was 20 months
when my wife split.</i>

20:36.408 --> 20:40.088
You know what he calls
the asshole she married? Daddy.

20:40.288 --> 20:42.608
<i>–That's not gonna happen.
–Oh, really?</i>

20:42.648 --> 20:45.248
<i>You don't move fast in this business,
you're gonna get run over.</i>

20:45.288 --> 20:48.968
<i>–I don't know.
–In California, there's
a six-month holding period…</i>

20:49.008 --> 20:50.808
before a divorce becomes legal.

20:50.848 --> 20:53.208
<i>You two patch things up
before then…</i>

20:53.248 --> 20:55.208
<i>you can withdraw the petition.</i>

20:55.248 --> 20:58.808
If you want to protect yourself,
you gotta move now.

21:03.648 --> 21:05.888
Detective…

21:06.048 --> 21:07.688
your kit's back.

21:07.728 --> 21:10.328
Shouldn't you be out
doing something heroic?

21:10.368 --> 21:13.528
Figured I'd give
someone else a chance.

21:13.728 --> 21:16.488
Well, there was
bruising on her breast…

21:16.688 --> 21:18.728
slight tearing
around the vagina.

21:18.768 --> 21:21.208
<i>–Consistent with her statement.
–Try not to look so happy…</i>

21:21.248 --> 21:24.248
<i>when reading rape kit results.
–Huh.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:27.448
<i>There's a lot of semen.</i>

21:27.608 --> 21:30.168
<i>–She said Rosen wore a condom.
–Exactly.</i>

21:30.208 --> 21:34.088
Not only that,
most of the sperm was still alive.

21:34.208 --> 21:36.048
<i>Means it was less
than 24 hours old…</i>

21:36.088 --> 21:39.248
which means she had sex
the day after her rape.

21:39.368 --> 21:42.168
That's not what she told me.

21:44.168 --> 21:46.288
All right, I checked the plates
of those dudes following us.

21:46.328 --> 21:48.770
The car belongs
to Trent's Auto Body.

21:48.848 --> 21:51.648
T.A.B.
Tommy Aaron Bankston.

21:51.808 --> 21:53.848
<i>–The chief?
–It's code for the dummy shop…</i>

21:53.888 --> 21:56.208
North Hollywood created
to cover surveillance.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.648
It means the guys tailing us
aren't Justice. They're us.

21:58.688 --> 22:00.648
There's a department
budget code.

22:00.688 --> 22:03.448
–Listed as I.A.
–I.A.D?

22:03.648 --> 22:05.688
You're way off.
I.A.D only runs out of downtown.

22:05.728 --> 22:08.698
It's gotta be another part
of the department.

22:13.488 --> 22:15.608
Independent auditor.

22:15.728 --> 22:17.888
Shit, those clowns
are on loan to Lanie Kellis.

22:17.928 --> 22:20.528
She's had her little goons
up our asses.

22:20.568 --> 22:24.066
<i>Well, if she wants
to waste her time, let her.</i>

22:26.168 --> 22:29.138
<i>Wait until she sees us bring in Dante.</i>

22:30.008 --> 22:32.714
–What up?
–Yo, Vic, I got a bead on Frog.

22:33.088 --> 22:36.528
–Where at?
–Collin Greens.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.848
I need a warrant fast.

22:39.008 --> 22:40.808
You got a location on Dante?

22:40.848 --> 22:43.768
No. Buddy of his named Frogger.
We think he knows where Dante is though.

22:43.808 --> 22:46.128
Well, Dante's wanted federally.
If this guy's a material witness…

22:46.168 --> 22:49.688
the fastest way is to get
a warrant from the feds.

22:49.728 --> 22:52.688
If we want all the credit on this,
we gotta do the heavy lifting.

22:52.728 --> 22:54.888
Where's this Frogger hiding?

22:56.688 --> 22:59.130
–Collin Greens.
–That place is a zoo.

22:59.168 --> 23:00.808
<i>–We'll have to go in heavy.
–Can't.</i>

23:00.848 --> 23:03.368
<i>Frogger's just a guy
who can lead us to Dante.</i>

23:03.408 --> 23:06.248
We go in full force,
Dante'll hightail it across 13 States.

23:06.288 --> 23:09.048
–It's gotta be just me and my guys.
–This lead's solid?

23:09.088 --> 23:12.088
Because if it's not
and this blows up in our faces…

23:12.128 --> 23:14.488
<i>–Lanie's got even more ammo.
–It's solid.</i>

23:14.528 --> 23:17.808
All right.
I'll call Judge Arias right now.

23:24.848 --> 23:29.798
All right, listen. This place is the
tribal council for the Compton Crowns.

23:29.888 --> 23:32.248
<i>Best way up's gonna be the first stairwell
on the right. It's unmarked.</i>

23:32.288 --> 23:35.448
–They all are.
–Crowns making it hard for us to do our job?

23:35.488 --> 23:37.528
Always. Only the people who live here
know which place is which.

23:37.568 --> 23:41.198
<i>–Well, how'd you find out?
–I got contacts here.</i>

23:41.368 --> 23:43.728
–Decent folks who hate living in a cell block.
–When did you talk to 'em?

23:43.768 --> 23:47.328
4 a.m. I've been sitting on this place all night,
making sure Frogger didn't hop away.

23:47.368 --> 23:50.008
That's great work.
Everybody ready?

23:50.208 --> 23:52.688
<i>Detective Mackey!</i>

23:52.808 --> 23:56.448
<i>–Who the hell are you?
–Special Agent Vulpio, F.B.I.</i>

23:56.488 --> 23:58.528
We understand you're executing
a warrant involving Dante Fell.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.448
<i>–Who told you that?
–He's a federal fugitive.</i>

24:00.488 --> 24:02.208
We have jurisdiction in this case.

24:02.248 --> 24:07.792
We're gonna go get our guy nice and quiet.
Then we can figure out who he belongs to.

24:09.328 --> 24:12.048
<i>You don't understand, Detective!</i>

24:12.248 --> 24:14.648
–You're not making any arrest
without us present!
–Shut up!

24:14.688 --> 24:17.688
<i>–Five-oh!
–Goddamn it, we gotta go right now!</i>

24:17.728 --> 24:20.566
–Which one is he in?
–It's that one! There!

24:21.168 --> 24:23.082
<i>All right, grab cover.</i>

24:23.088 --> 24:25.848
Goddamn it, grab some cover
and watch our backs.

24:25.888 --> 24:27.968
Shane, let's go!

24:35.648 --> 24:37.768
<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!</i>

24:37.888 --> 24:41.448
–Where the hell is it coming from?
–I don't know!

24:41.648 --> 24:44.208
Somebody call for backup!

24:45.968 --> 24:47.928
On the ground!
On your knees right now!

24:47.968 --> 24:49.688
Hands on your head right now!

24:49.728 --> 24:51.888
–Are we clear?
–Clear!

24:51.928 --> 24:54.008
All right, which one of you
is Frogger?

24:54.048 --> 24:56.328
<i>Huh? Which one?</i>

24:56.448 --> 25:00.568
<i>Better question:
how the hell are we getting out of here?</i>

25:00.608 --> 25:04.568
<i>We're having a problem
making this case.</i>

25:04.728 --> 25:06.648
Your daughter said that
Mr Rosen wore a condom…

25:06.688 --> 25:09.658
but the rape kit shows
the presence of semen.

25:09.968 --> 25:13.448
My daughter was a virgin
before she was raped.

25:13.768 --> 25:18.784
<i>Well, the results also prove that she had
intercourse after the rape.</i>

25:19.728 --> 25:22.888
<i>Did you know she was sexually active
with her boyfriend Miguel?</i>

25:22.928 --> 25:27.128
–That's not true.
–Maybe she thought you'd
find out she was having sex…

25:27.168 --> 25:30.204
and made up a story
about her boss raping her.

25:30.448 --> 25:32.648
No. It's not a story.

25:32.768 --> 25:34.768
It's the truth.

25:34.888 --> 25:36.848
I had sex with Miguel
two nights ago.

25:36.888 --> 25:41.574
Girls who get raped on Friday night
don't usually have sex on Saturday.

25:43.488 --> 25:45.408
He didn't rape you, did he?

25:47.608 --> 25:49.654
<i>What was it, Evette?
He…</i>

25:49.688 --> 25:52.088
He threatened to fire you,
so you fired back?

25:52.128 --> 25:54.568
He raped me.

26:00.048 --> 26:02.358
You say you fought him
to get away.

26:02.448 --> 26:07.448
No bruises on your arms.
No skin under your nails.

26:11.328 --> 26:15.368
Your story doesn't wash.
I don't believe you.

26:17.888 --> 26:20.888
–You're lying.
–No, I'm not.

26:21.008 --> 26:23.488
Mr Rosen's bigger than you.
It seems odd he wouldn't leave a mark.

26:23.528 --> 26:26.088
He did leave a mark.

26:29.288 --> 26:34.368
Here… and here.

26:37.848 --> 26:40.048
Why can't you believe that?

26:48.048 --> 26:49.768
What? I saw you looking.

26:49.808 --> 26:53.888
–You're mistaken.
–Where are you going?

26:54.368 --> 26:56.968
I think we know what happened
in that store. Nothing.

26:57.008 --> 26:58.408
This case is over.

26:58.608 --> 27:02.368
No, it's not! He raped me!
He needs to pay.

27:02.408 --> 27:05.048
If you don't help me,
I'll tell people that you just grabbed me.

27:05.088 --> 27:06.888
You just did.

27:09.168 --> 27:11.808
Now the whole world knows
you're a liar.

27:15.328 --> 27:17.902
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

27:22.488 --> 27:25.368
All right, that's the room right up there, okay?
Secure the perimeter.

27:25.408 --> 27:29.170
<i>–Somebody already took
a couple of potshots at us.</i>

27:31.568 --> 27:33.928
–I ain't going out there!
–Don't worry. We got you covered.

27:33.968 --> 27:36.568
Somebody takes a shot at you,
they might hit me by mistake!

27:36.608 --> 27:38.848
Then tell me where Dante is.

27:45.848 --> 27:48.158
–Let's go.
–Let's go. On your feet.

28:02.368 --> 28:04.248
<i>Get him in.</i>

28:04.408 --> 28:07.368
<i>You take your own car.</i>

28:13.128 --> 28:14.844
Bring him upstairs to two.

28:15.008 --> 28:16.768
What happened?
Is everyone okay?

28:16.808 --> 28:20.168
Someone tipped off the feds about our bust.
One guess who.

28:20.208 --> 28:23.648
–This is a federal case.
They had every right to know.
–They blew our covert entry…

28:23.688 --> 28:26.528
put each one of my men in extreme danger,
you sanctimonious little bitch.

28:26.568 --> 28:29.528
–I'll be sure to include
that quote in my report.
–Include whatever you like.

28:29.568 --> 28:35.442
Tell those amateurs you got following me
they might as well take the rest of the day off!

28:42.208 --> 28:44.568
<i>What are you,
about a buck thirty soaking wet, Froggy?</i>

28:44.608 --> 28:47.974
<i>–Buck sixty.
–Hardly Compton Crown material.</i>

28:48.368 --> 28:50.808
Thank God your quarter bro
pushed through your membership.

28:50.848 --> 28:53.368
<i>–I earned my rep.
–Oh, yeah?</i>

28:53.568 --> 28:56.528
We'll see. Where's Dante?

28:56.688 --> 28:58.848
–Don't know.
–Why's he in town?

28:59.008 --> 29:01.048
–Don't know.
–Oh, so he is in town?

29:01.088 --> 29:02.928
Didn't say that.

29:03.128 --> 29:04.768
Christ, this is gonna be easy.

29:04.808 --> 29:07.248
Yes, it is.

29:07.408 --> 29:09.328
<i>Yeah?</i>

29:21.408 --> 29:23.728
You were right about Mackey.

29:23.888 --> 29:25.688
He's not on the level.

29:27.408 --> 29:29.982
You wanted me
to find some dirt on him.

29:30.088 --> 29:32.328
I may have found something.

29:32.448 --> 29:35.682
You have my word
your name will not be mentioned.

29:39.648 --> 29:43.248
Today I saw him
committing a 225-02VC.

29:43.368 --> 29:45.888
What is that?

29:45.888 --> 29:49.188
He parked more than
six inches away from the curb.

29:50.688 --> 29:55.768
–Excuse me?
–Look, if you want something
more than that, lady…

29:55.888 --> 29:58.462
you're gonna have
to do it on your own.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.768
–We've got proof.
–What proof?

30:12.848 --> 30:15.128
It's what he used.

30:15.168 --> 30:19.128
I'm gonna sue that man
and his store for everything.

30:19.368 --> 30:23.288
–How'd you get that?
–I went through the trash
at the back of the store.

30:23.328 --> 30:26.048
You went through three days
of store garbage to find this?

30:26.088 --> 30:29.248
It was the only way
to make you believe me.

30:29.408 --> 30:31.728
I was a virgin before he raped me.

30:40.688 --> 30:42.808
What the hell's this?

31:02.808 --> 31:04.722
<i>Stop showing me those.</i>

31:04.728 --> 31:07.088
You know what really
makes me sick about these?

31:07.128 --> 31:10.328
It's that your quarter bro
is responsible for all these deaths.

31:10.368 --> 31:14.408
They're Crown casualties
from all his franchised cities.

31:14.528 --> 31:16.706
And these are
just the innocents!

31:21.328 --> 31:25.248
–What?
–These are three cops from San Antonio.

31:30.288 --> 31:33.408
Where's Dante?

31:33.568 --> 31:36.768
You're obstructing justice.

31:36.768 --> 31:40.488
One of you's going to jail for this,
and you're not built for it.

31:40.528 --> 31:42.928
But he is.

31:43.128 --> 31:47.648
–I swear to God, if I see one more…
–He's at Mission Cross!

31:47.848 --> 31:51.288
One of his girls is having a baby.

31:52.688 --> 31:54.568
He's here for the birth
of his child?

31:54.608 --> 31:56.808
<i>It's his first son.</i>

31:56.968 --> 32:00.598
He kept it secret from everyone
except me he was a dad.

32:02.368 --> 32:04.612
Ursula went into labor
last night.

32:04.768 --> 32:06.488
Of course she did.

32:08.728 --> 32:10.368
I'll let the chief know.

32:10.488 --> 32:14.288
You can let him know after we
bring the suspect into custody.

32:14.328 --> 32:18.528
We earned this, and no one
is beating us to this arrest.

32:26.888 --> 32:31.848
–Ursula Hayes. What's her room number?
–Room 607.

32:33.728 --> 32:36.368
Okay, you guys go through here.
–Mm-hmm.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.688
You.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.808
What are you doing?

33:03.248 --> 33:05.568
Dante, put the baby down.

33:05.728 --> 33:08.168
You need to put the baby down
right now and come with us.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.924
Don't give us any trouble.

33:11.528 --> 33:14.648
I won't.
Just give me a minute.

33:18.848 --> 33:21.048
He's my boy.

33:22.688 --> 33:25.408
Hey. It's okay, boy.

33:25.608 --> 33:28.568
–I thought this was all over?
–Yeah, um…

33:28.728 --> 33:30.708
they brought in
a used condom…

33:30.848 --> 33:34.478
<i>and we have to handle it as evidence.
–A condom?</i>

33:34.608 --> 33:37.168
–She fished it out of the trash
in the back of the store.
–She what?

33:37.208 --> 33:39.168
So how do we get this
cleared up?

33:39.208 --> 33:41.328
We do a D.N.A test
to rule you out.

33:41.368 --> 33:45.248
<i>–Great.
–We can have the nurse draw
blood within the hour…</i>

33:45.288 --> 33:47.768
if we get your permission.
–Great.

33:50.848 --> 33:53.158
What if I don't give
my permission?

33:57.088 --> 33:58.888
Well, uh…

33:59.008 --> 34:02.968
with probable cause,
we can get a warrant to draw the blood.

34:04.328 --> 34:06.528
Bruce?

34:08.248 --> 34:11.447
<i>What did you do?
Did you…</i>

34:14.888 --> 34:17.568
It wasn't rape.

34:17.768 --> 34:19.487
What do you mean?

34:24.447 --> 34:29.128
She came on to me,
and I couldn't, uh, help myself.

34:30.568 --> 34:34.808
<i>The next day, um,
they blackmailed me.</i>

34:34.848 --> 34:38.411
She and her mom came,
said if I didn't pay 'em $5·000…

34:38.487 --> 34:41.656
they'd go to the head office
and… and report me.

34:41.728 --> 34:45.368
<i>We don't have that kind of money.
I di…</i>

34:45.568 --> 34:48.888
<i>I-I didn't rape her.</i>

34:49.088 --> 34:51.134
It was consensual.
I mean, I-I…

34:51.168 --> 34:53.888
I even walked her
to her car afterwards.

34:54.088 --> 34:57.408
You slept with a child!

34:57.568 --> 35:00.728
Okay. All right.

35:00.848 --> 35:05.248
You will never see
our daughter again!

35:05.448 --> 35:08.208
–Okay.
–Never!

35:15.168 --> 35:19.008
<i>Another win for me
right before the final bell.</i>

35:19.248 --> 35:22.152
Maybe I won't need
your help to keep my job.

35:23.568 --> 35:25.288
Listen.

35:27.488 --> 35:29.688
I put in a good word for you.

35:29.848 --> 35:33.048
–Thank you.
–Not because you're my partner.

35:33.248 --> 35:36.128
Because you're a good detective.

35:36.128 --> 35:39.768
And because you don't want to see
the partnership broken up, right?

35:39.808 --> 35:41.524
<i>Come with me, miss.</i>

35:51.768 --> 35:54.248
Yo, wassup?
How do this sound to you?

35:54.408 --> 35:56.248
–Great.
–Great?

35:56.328 --> 35:58.208
Man, she gonna knock
Lauryn Hill on her ass.

35:58.248 --> 36:00.568
Couple of more scores,
bring in some more players…

36:00.608 --> 36:03.768
get on tour,
build up the hype.

36:03.968 --> 36:06.328
But, yo, I got word
on a couple of operations.

36:06.368 --> 36:08.128
Think it might be
our best way back in.

36:08.168 --> 36:11.888
Listen, Kern, uh,
we're not gonna be getting back in.

36:13.568 --> 36:15.848
<i>–What do you mean?
–I lied.</i>

36:17.528 --> 36:20.008
–What?
–I had to.

36:20.208 --> 36:22.648
To get Dante.
It was important.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.928
Lied to me?

36:24.968 --> 36:27.928
<i>Listen, me and my guys aren't
going down that road again.</i>

36:27.968 --> 36:29.816
We're out of the drug trade.

36:30.008 --> 36:32.728
<i>If you're smart,
you'll stay out too.</i>

36:32.768 --> 36:36.048
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
come after you just like anybody else.

36:36.088 --> 36:39.808
Stay out?
I called in my old crew.

36:40.008 --> 36:42.648
I borrowed off
future transactions.

36:42.848 --> 36:45.008
I don't got no more money coming in!

36:45.048 --> 36:47.168
I came here to tell you straight up
what the deal was.

36:47.208 --> 36:48.768
I owed you at least that much.

36:48.808 --> 36:50.528
Man, you owe me
a shitload more than that!

36:50.568 --> 36:53.528
I risked my ass on the line
to get you Frogger! You promised…

36:53.568 --> 36:55.688
Hey, he broke his promise, all right?
So just get over it.

36:55.728 --> 36:58.208
We can let this stand,
get past it.

36:58.208 --> 37:02.828
I can make it up to you in some other way or…
you can start something.

37:03.648 --> 37:06.024
<i>–This is wrong, man.
–I know.</i>

37:06.048 --> 37:11.448
But you came up from nothing once before.
You can do it again.

37:33.568 --> 37:35.928
–Can you drive it or not?
–Yeah.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.328
Jesus!

37:46.408 --> 37:50.104
–Dude, what are you doing?
–Nothing… I got it. I got it.

37:55.728 --> 37:58.528
<i>–You guys all right?
–Yeah, why?</i>

37:58.528 --> 38:02.168
Well, I heard a garbage truck
sideswiped two parked cars.

38:02.208 --> 38:04.128
–You heard about that?
–It was all over the police radio.

38:04.168 --> 38:07.488
–Well, it took a little while
to figure out the controls.
–Jesus, come on!

38:07.528 --> 38:09.888
This is supposed to be
a quiet operation.

38:09.928 --> 38:13.208
We fumble like this during the actual
money train, we'll all end up in jail!

38:13.248 --> 38:14.808
Sorry.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.288
How long do we get to
keep the truck here?

38:19.328 --> 38:23.420
<i>–Property sweeps aren't
for another three weeks.
–Good.</i>

38:23.808 --> 38:25.528
Yeah.

38:30.088 --> 38:33.048
We're really doing this,
aren't we?

38:35.168 --> 38:36.848
Yeah, looks that way.

38:51.528 --> 38:53.528
I want my credit card back.

38:57.968 --> 38:59.968
Somebody canceled it anyway.

39:03.288 --> 39:05.448
You're taking this stuff back.

39:05.568 --> 39:08.208
No. I'm gonna sell it.
I need the money.

39:08.368 --> 39:10.288
You're taking it back.

39:10.408 --> 39:13.008
Take me back.

39:30.928 --> 39:32.648
Keep away from me.

39:35.768 --> 39:38.008
Keep away from my wife.

39:45.168 --> 39:48.128
–I'm leaving.
–Good-bye.

39:50.248 --> 39:52.558
When my report
comes out next week…

39:52.688 --> 39:54.568
it will hit like an earthquake.

39:54.608 --> 39:57.848
–So we'll all be buried in the rubble?
–Not you.

39:58.008 --> 40:01.288
I'm recommending that you be
elevated to captain, take over here…

40:01.328 --> 40:03.768
and run things the way
they should be.

40:03.808 --> 40:06.448
You have integrity.
You tell the truth.

40:06.488 --> 40:10.382
The truth is your report
is only gonna cause a few tremors.

40:10.648 --> 40:13.848
<i>You're not the first civilian auditor
this department has had…</i>

40:13.888 --> 40:16.168
<i>and in the end,
cops will protect cops.</i>

40:16.208 --> 40:18.608
Outrage will turn to apathy…

40:18.648 --> 40:21.248
turn to, “Didn't something
happen there once?”

40:21.288 --> 40:23.368
And it all goes back
to the way it was.

40:23.408 --> 40:26.048
Maybe with someone like you in charge,
things might change.

40:26.088 --> 40:28.088
I wouldn't want the job.

40:36.368 --> 40:39.404
One officer saves a kid
from some car jackers.

40:39.528 --> 40:43.620
My team hauls in a guy
the feds have been after for two years.

40:45.088 --> 40:48.916
I really hope you got a plan
to fix things up around here.

41:12.408 --> 41:15.888
<i>I talked to the guy at the desk.
I know you're in here.</i>

41:15.928 --> 41:18.288
<i>Vic!</i>

41:22.248 --> 41:26.808
<i>Vic, I know you're in here!</i>

41:27.168 --> 41:29.688
<i>Open the door!
Come on!</i>

41:33.488 --> 41:37.408
You have some stranger come
to the house at night and give me this?

41:37.448 --> 41:40.608
–You're walking out on us?
–I'm not walking out on my kids.

41:40.648 --> 41:43.088
–I'm protecting myself from you.
–From me?

41:43.128 --> 41:45.528
From divorcing me.
From keeping them from me.

41:45.568 --> 41:48.888
–You think I'm divorcing you?
–You're seeing a lawyer.

41:48.928 --> 41:52.008
A friend of mine made me talk to him.
It doesn't mean that I'm filing.

41:52.048 --> 41:55.008
Oh, that's bullshit.
You're seeing him again on Tuesday.

41:55.048 --> 41:58.208
Jesus Christ, I have to sign some papers
to get my deposit back.

41:58.248 --> 42:03.396
You said that we were trying to figure
things out. That… That's what you said.

42:06.808 --> 42:10.528
You're just buying time…
to spring this on me.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.368
N-No.

42:31.568 --> 42:35.608
Don't touch me!

42:37.408 --> 42:40.648
I can make you miserable too.
