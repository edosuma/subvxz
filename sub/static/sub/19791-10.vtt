WEBVTT

00:01.058 --> 00:03.226
Come on! You gotta eat somethin'.

00:03.260 --> 00:04.828
I mean, it's almost nine
o'clock, you're usually

00:04.862 --> 00:06.830
on your third breakfast by now.

00:06.864 --> 00:10.333
Sorry, but I'm just way
too nervous to eat anything.

00:10.368 --> 00:12.268
You know what? Maybe
just a waffle to go?

00:12.303 --> 00:13.937
Or... Or two, maybe
two waffles to go?

00:13.971 --> 00:15.053
And will you put some eggs in that?

00:15.153 --> 00:18.622
Honey, this might be the most
important trial of my career.

00:18.657 --> 00:19.857
Defending Brad?

00:19.891 --> 00:20.891
He's not just Brad,

00:20.926 --> 00:22.560
he's your mother's husband.

00:22.594 --> 00:24.795
And if your mother's husband
goes back to jail, I mean,

00:24.830 --> 00:26.597
she's just gonna, peck out my soul

00:26.631 --> 00:28.348
until I'm nothing but a hollow shell.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.936
Oh, you know... maybe
a few pieces of bacon?

00:31.970 --> 00:33.337
Okay, yeah.

00:33.371 --> 00:35.386
Wait. Is this it?

00:35.841 --> 00:37.008
Is this the letter from the doctor

00:37.042 --> 00:38.777
saying what the sex of our baby is?

00:39.044 --> 00:41.078
You've had our baby in your
briefcase this entire time

00:41.113 --> 00:43.181
and you didn't tell me?

00:43.215 --> 00:45.888
No, because we already decided
we didn't wanna find out the sex.

00:45.918 --> 00:49.020
Well, that was a little more
of a "you" than a "we" decision.

00:49.054 --> 00:50.507
Come on, don't you wanna know?

00:50.656 --> 00:52.200
This makes it so real.

00:52.291 --> 00:55.727
Yeah, 'cause up until now, it's
just been this crazy fantasy.

00:55.761 --> 00:57.329
Hey, guys, I've been
doing some spring cleaning,

00:57.363 --> 00:59.490
and thought you might like some
of Emma's old clothes for the baby.

00:59.632 --> 01:01.800
Or you just didn't
feel like doin' laundry.

01:01.834 --> 01:04.019
Don't poke holes in this,
you're getting free clothes.

01:04.671 --> 01:06.705
I so don't have time for this.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.340
All right, wish me luck.

01:08.375 --> 01:11.377
Luck, I predict that thing will be
gone before you hit the elevator.

01:13.913 --> 01:15.552
Look at you, dude!

01:15.615 --> 01:18.243
Your lips don't even move anymore
when you're trying to read!

01:18.685 --> 01:20.613
The sex of our baby is
in this envelope and

01:20.639 --> 01:22.210
Riley doesn't want
to know what it is.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.323
You'd wanna know if you were
havin' a boy or a girl, right?

01:24.358 --> 01:26.425
Hell, yeah. Although I'd have been cool

01:26.460 --> 01:27.991
just knowing I was having a baby.

01:28.796 --> 01:29.796
Why don't you open it?

01:29.830 --> 01:31.453
Because I promised Riley I wouldn't.

01:31.532 --> 01:34.867
Oh, right. Sacred bond. Gotcha.

01:34.902 --> 01:36.180
Which is why I'll open it!

01:36.237 --> 01:37.804
And if we get caught,
we can blame it on Emma.

01:37.838 --> 01:40.039
Honestly, it's one of the
best parts about havin' a kid.

01:40.074 --> 01:41.621
Oh! Pregnancy brain.

01:41.709 --> 01:44.010
What was I thinking?

01:44.045 --> 01:46.681
And you were right.

01:46.781 --> 01:48.971
Dude! It never fails!

01:49.071 --> 01:51.706
Sometimes I wonder if women
can actually smell deceit.

01:51.740 --> 01:52.740
We can.

02:07.122 --> 02:09.556
Okay, Mrs. Wheeler, are you
ready to head to the courthouse?

02:09.591 --> 02:11.259
Do you mean am I ready

02:11.293 --> 02:12.994
to see the man of my dreams

02:13.028 --> 02:14.462
locked away?

02:14.496 --> 02:16.564
Am I ready to be left alone,

02:16.598 --> 02:19.667
out in the cold with no one to turn to?

02:19.701 --> 02:23.371
No! No, I am not ready!

02:23.405 --> 02:25.306
Oh, my God! I can't lose him!

02:28.043 --> 02:29.577
Mrs. Wheeler, calm down.

02:29.611 --> 02:31.045
All right? It is gonna be okay.

02:31.079 --> 02:32.113
I know, I was just practicing

02:32.147 --> 02:33.781
for my big moment on the stand.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.615
And if that doesn't sway the jury,

02:37.715 --> 02:39.049
then these babies

02:39.083 --> 02:41.351
definitely will.

02:43.688 --> 02:44.821
Well, they didn't sway me

02:44.856 --> 02:46.723
to make you breakfast this morning.

02:48.059 --> 02:49.292
Okay, all today is about

02:49.327 --> 02:50.660
is getting this thing postponed.

02:50.695 --> 02:52.496
When Bustamonte fled the country,

02:52.530 --> 02:54.898
I managed to get a box of his
files seized at the border.

02:54.932 --> 02:56.299
Box? I mean, what's in the box?

02:56.334 --> 02:57.868
Bank statements that
will hopefully prove

02:57.902 --> 03:00.303
he is the real mastermind
behind the whole scheme.

03:00.338 --> 03:01.371
You're a genius!

03:01.405 --> 03:02.873
But it hasn't arrived.

03:02.907 --> 03:04.574
You're an idiot!

03:04.609 --> 03:05.942
Mrs. Wheeler, this box

03:05.977 --> 03:07.043
is the only thing we have

03:07.078 --> 03:08.912
to prove Brad is innocent.

03:08.946 --> 03:10.013
And, when I say innocent,

03:10.047 --> 03:12.749
I mean only slightly guilty.

03:12.783 --> 03:14.284
Well, I hope we get that old judge

03:14.318 --> 03:15.652
who erased all my parking tickets.

03:15.686 --> 03:16.853
I only had to go to second base

03:16.888 --> 03:18.088
for him for that.

03:18.122 --> 03:19.156
But I am willing

03:19.190 --> 03:20.423
to hit a home run, huh?

03:20.458 --> 03:22.225
No. No, no, no.

03:23.394 --> 03:25.529
Well, unfortunately,
we have Judge Johnson.

03:25.563 --> 03:27.831
Yeah, soon to be known as Lady Justice.

03:27.865 --> 03:28.899
This is her last trial

03:28.933 --> 03:29.735
before she leaves to star

03:29.835 --> 03:30.538
in her own TV show.

03:30.638 --> 03:31.738
And now I'm interested.

03:32.098 --> 03:33.666
And you weren't when it
was just about my husband

03:33.700 --> 03:35.267
spending his life in jail?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.769
Yeah, not so much.

03:36.803 --> 03:39.071
But! But I heard that Judge Johnson

03:39.105 --> 03:41.140
is gonna be the new face of daytime TV.

03:41.174 --> 03:42.775
I was just gonna send her my head shot,

03:42.809 --> 03:45.377
but my real head would be better.

03:45.412 --> 03:47.012
Look, you have to help
me get in to see her.

03:47.047 --> 03:49.682
Yeah, yeah, because it's not like
Riley has anything better to do.

03:49.716 --> 03:53.585
Um, I heard her defense, so,
no, I don't think she does.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.754
Okay, you know what?
Brad is gonna be fine.

03:55.789 --> 03:58.524
I am going to win this case,
and he is going to go free.

03:58.558 --> 03:59.432
Okay.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.633
Oh, God, even I don't believe me.
Let's go.

04:02.183 --> 04:05.485
Oh, hey, babe. I feel like I
didn't give you a proper send-off.

04:08.255 --> 04:10.089
I used to kiss your father like that.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.824
He's gay now. Can we go?

04:13.594 --> 04:14.334
Let's do this!

04:14.434 --> 04:15.968
Yeah, all right, you are not coming.

04:16.002 --> 04:18.937
I know. But if you see a
dude there that looks like me,

04:18.971 --> 04:20.272
it's not.

04:21.708 --> 04:22.875
You're just being racist.

04:22.909 --> 04:24.309
Oh, come on.

04:27.814 --> 04:28.445
Did you get it?

04:28.471 --> 04:30.382
No, that bag was full
of candy wrappers.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.449
It's like a chocolate cemetery in there.

04:34.554 --> 04:36.355
Brad.

04:36.590 --> 04:39.792
You stay strong. And know that
if things don't go your way,

04:39.826 --> 04:44.096
I will be right here beside you...
at least through the first appeal.

04:45.365 --> 04:48.067
Have no fear, Lady Justice is here.

04:48.101 --> 04:51.170
That little catchphrase is
gonna make me a million dollars.

04:51.204 --> 04:54.874
Uh, Ms. Perrin, I see here
that you're petitioning

04:54.908 --> 04:55.864
to court to postpone this trial.

04:55.964 --> 04:57.732
I... I am, your honor.
I am just waiting

04:57.766 --> 05:00.134
on a box of evidence that
will prove that my client...

05:00.169 --> 05:02.637
Do you actually know what's in this box?

05:02.671 --> 05:04.806
Oh, yes, completely.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.409
Not one hundred percent exactly,
no, but I have a very strong hunch.

05:08.443 --> 05:11.946
Mm. I had a hunch that
leftover Indian food

05:11.980 --> 05:14.583
would make a good breakfast.
 So much for hunches.

05:14.683 --> 05:16.284
Petition denied.

05:17.653 --> 05:19.764
So... good news.

05:19.864 --> 05:21.498
We're going to trial.

05:28.806 --> 05:32.409
Excuse me...

05:32.443 --> 05:33.643
Who the hell are you?

05:33.678 --> 05:35.979
Tucker Dobbs. I hope you
don't mind, I let myself in.

05:36.013 --> 05:38.715
I do mind, but I think I know you.

05:38.749 --> 05:40.483
You've been in my court before.

05:40.518 --> 05:43.620
Guilty of breaking
my heart, if I recall.

05:43.654 --> 05:46.359
Uh... that's me.

05:46.791 --> 05:48.625
Uh, first of all, I
just want you to know

05:48.660 --> 05:51.395
that I am a huge fan of your work,

05:51.429 --> 05:53.463
and second, you need me.

05:53.498 --> 05:57.801
What I need is a manicure,
a mai tai, and a boy toy

05:57.835 --> 06:00.327
with an ass so tight I can
bounce a quarter off of it.

06:01.773 --> 06:04.808
Any chance you got change for a dollar?

06:04.843 --> 06:08.412
Uh, no, no. I meant you
need me for your show.

06:08.446 --> 06:10.080
I produced for the Mary
Hart show for two years...

06:10.115 --> 06:11.472
No, forget it, forget it.

06:11.483 --> 06:14.051
I already got a pack of yappy
producers tellin' me what to do.

06:14.085 --> 06:17.396
But what you don't have
is a yappy on-air sidekick.

06:17.489 --> 06:20.458
Right? You know, feedin' you
lines and makin' you look good.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.660
Ooh. I like lookin' good.

06:22.694 --> 06:25.696
Okay. Get yourself a uniform,
I'll let you audition.

06:25.731 --> 06:28.483
And... And start thinking
of some catchphrases.

06:28.801 --> 06:31.035
Yeah, um...

06:31.070 --> 06:33.404
You don't need to wear no pants,

06:33.439 --> 06:36.569
the robe decides what's de evidence.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.544
- Yeah, but not that one.
- Yeah, okay.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.848
Okay. Here's how it's gonna go.

06:42.882 --> 06:44.616
We'll intercept her in a
neutral spot, the coffee shop

06:44.651 --> 06:46.418
on the corner of Wall and Chambers.

06:46.452 --> 06:49.821
While she's focused on shoving a
chocolate croissant down her gullet,

06:49.856 --> 06:52.557
I'll surreptitiously
extract the envelope,

06:52.592 --> 06:54.559
run across the road,
photocopy the contents,

06:54.594 --> 06:56.460
and replace it before she
even knows it went missing.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.761
What do you think? It
honestly cannot be any simpler.

07:00.397 --> 07:01.798
Something tells me it could be.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.601
Look, do you want that envelope or not?

07:04.635 --> 07:07.170
It's not like she's gonna walk
in here and drop it in our laps.

07:07.204 --> 07:10.694
That was a total crap cocktail
with a double crap chaser!

07:11.743 --> 07:15.011
Mrs. Wheeler, it really wasn't that bad.

07:15.046 --> 07:17.114
I mean, honestly, I thought
it was gonna be a lot worse.

07:17.148 --> 07:18.749
Hey, and what are we supposed to do

07:18.783 --> 07:20.853
if we never get that box
of so-called evidence?

07:21.119 --> 07:25.155
Let Brad go to jail just because
he broke a couple of stupid laws?

07:26.291 --> 07:28.759
That is kind of how the system works.

07:30.195 --> 07:31.262
Hey!

07:33.798 --> 07:35.366
What are you two so excited about?

07:35.400 --> 07:39.052
Oh, uh, we're both just really
happy the trial's goin' so well.

07:39.571 --> 07:41.439
It's not.

07:41.473 --> 07:44.075
Then we should probably leave
you alone to strategize, bye!

07:46.411 --> 07:47.912
- Ready?
- Yes!

07:47.980 --> 07:49.247
No, wait!

07:49.281 --> 07:50.448
Okay, tell me.

07:50.482 --> 07:52.216
Wait, no, don't tell me!

07:52.251 --> 07:54.579
- I don't know...
- Oh-ho, too late!

07:56.155 --> 07:57.222
What the hell is this?

07:57.256 --> 08:00.325
Oh my God, it's not a boy or a girl?

08:00.359 --> 08:01.726
What am I having?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.561
It doesn't matter, I
will love it anyway.

08:04.597 --> 08:06.931
No, it's a phone number
to something called

08:06.966 --> 08:08.667
the Baby Place, with a special code.

08:08.701 --> 08:10.902
Oh, I forgot. Yeah, we told the doctor

08:10.936 --> 08:12.537
to send the results to this baby shop

08:12.571 --> 08:15.040
that sends us a cake that's
either blue or pink on the inside,

08:15.074 --> 08:18.076
so we can be surprised. It was my idea.

08:18.110 --> 08:20.829
That's genius. Not the
idea, that was lame.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.781
But now all you have
to do is call the store.

08:22.815 --> 08:25.455
We can't. Only Riley can tell
them where to deliver the cake.

08:25.618 --> 08:28.620
Got it.  Hey, yeah,
like, this is Riley Perrin,

08:28.655 --> 08:31.223
and I've got, like, this cake, okay?

08:31.257 --> 08:33.592
That was horrible.
Hi, this is Riley Perrin,

08:33.626 --> 08:36.929
wife of husband Danny
Wheeler? He's a hockey player.

08:36.962 --> 08:38.664
I was horrible?

08:45.639 --> 08:48.674
What the hell is the
matter with you two?

08:48.709 --> 08:50.648
Oh, uh, we're trying
to impersonate Riley

08:50.748 --> 08:52.083
so we can find out the sex of my baby.

08:52.183 --> 08:55.152
Hello? This is Riley
Perrin, and, and I'll sue your ass

08:55.186 --> 08:57.554
if you don't tell me what I'm having!

08:58.590 --> 09:00.091
Well, start dialing!

09:03.503 --> 09:05.641
Pretty big day Emma,
we're about to find out

09:05.741 --> 09:08.142
if you're getting a boy
cousin or a girl cousin.

09:08.176 --> 09:10.411
I want a puppy!

09:10.445 --> 09:13.614
Well, I want a motorcycle
and a girlfriend named Bambi,

09:13.649 --> 09:16.118
but we all have our disappointments.

09:16.218 --> 09:17.201
She finally left.

09:17.853 --> 09:20.288
Oh my God. Is that it? Is that the cake?

09:20.322 --> 09:23.291
No, I just decided to get up
early and do a little baking.

09:23.325 --> 09:25.026
Yes, that's the cake!

09:26.028 --> 09:27.500
Would you like to do the honors?

09:27.530 --> 09:28.663
Yes.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.199
No. I can't.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.034
Or maybe I can. Heh!

09:33.069 --> 09:34.865
You know what? Just give me a minute.

09:34.937 --> 09:37.806
You're gonna be a dad. Man up, dude!

09:39.208 --> 09:40.976
- It's a girl!
- It's a girl!

09:41.010 --> 09:42.210
I'm havin' a girl!

09:42.245 --> 09:44.446
You're havin' a girl!

09:44.480 --> 09:47.382
Finally, someone else will understand

09:47.417 --> 09:48.784
how hard it is to raise a girl.

09:48.818 --> 09:51.739
They look so cute, but they're
really just small women!

09:53.356 --> 09:54.338
Hey, what's that?

09:54.691 --> 09:56.592
I don't know, it came with the cake.

09:58.628 --> 10:00.329
Maybe should've looked at this first.

10:00.363 --> 10:01.764
It seems this cake actually belongs

10:01.798 --> 10:03.569
to a Gordon and Melinda Miller.

10:03.867 --> 10:06.235
Riley's havin' someone else's baby?

10:06.270 --> 10:07.670
No, Danny.

10:07.704 --> 10:09.605
Someone else is havin' Riley's baby?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.041
No, Danny!

10:11.141 --> 10:13.109
- Is Riley...
- Just forget it.

10:15.345 --> 10:18.481
All right, order in the
court. Put your papers away.

10:18.515 --> 10:21.350
We ready to start, and
Lady Justice don't play.

10:25.456 --> 10:29.444
I better bang this gavel before
this court unravels.

10:32.971 --> 10:35.973
When did Tucker become the po-po?

10:37.008 --> 10:40.177
That's prison slang for copper.

10:40.211 --> 10:42.679
Well, he's auditioning
to be her TV bailiff.

10:42.714 --> 10:43.914
Normally, I would just freak out,

10:43.948 --> 10:46.049
but honestly, it's the
least of our problems.

10:46.084 --> 10:49.798
My God! He is gonna make a
mockery of these proceedings!

10:50.355 --> 10:53.457
Okay, Brad, at the first
opportunity, take your shirt off.

10:53.491 --> 10:54.658
Got it.

10:55.694 --> 10:58.796
Okay, Counselor, since you seem
to have no case, no evidence,

10:58.830 --> 11:01.832
and no witnesses, can I assume
that you're just gonna stare at me

11:01.866 --> 11:03.914
until somebody yells "guilty"
and puts you outta your misery?

11:04.002 --> 11:05.496
Oh God, could you?

11:06.105 --> 11:08.840
I mean... Uh, no, no,
I... I have witnesses.

11:08.874 --> 11:10.975
Uh, a witness.

11:11.009 --> 11:14.178
I would like to call the
defendant to the stand.

11:18.951 --> 11:20.841
I need you to stall. We need
time to get that box of evidence.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.098
Got it.

11:24.378 --> 11:26.879
Could you please state
your name and occupation?

11:26.914 --> 11:28.948
Hmm!

11:28.982 --> 11:35.354
Brad... ley!

11:35.389 --> 11:36.071
What are you doing?

11:36.171 --> 11:37.805
Stalling.

11:37.839 --> 11:42.243
Walk... er!

11:44.412 --> 11:47.348
Hey, so congrats on the
baby. Here's your cake.

11:47.382 --> 11:49.381
There was a slight
mishap on the subway,

11:49.481 --> 11:52.386
but good news, you're
havin' a girl!

11:52.420 --> 11:55.256
Really? That's it?

11:55.290 --> 11:57.697
Months of anticipation, people
flying in from around the country

11:57.797 --> 11:59.698
for this party, and
you just blurt it out?

11:59.732 --> 12:01.733
Maybe you'd like to name her, too.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.235
Oh, I like Elisa.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.399
It was on our list, but we
ended up crossing it off,

12:06.499 --> 12:08.132
so feel free to take it.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.235
And in exchange for that priceless gift,

12:10.269 --> 12:12.036
could we possibly take our cake now?

12:12.071 --> 12:13.242
You seem to be busy.

12:13.306 --> 12:14.939
We don't have your cake.

12:14.974 --> 12:16.441
We sent it back when
we read the envelope

12:16.475 --> 12:18.145
and realized it wasn't ours.

12:18.378 --> 12:20.879
Like normal people!

12:20.914 --> 12:22.147
Right, honey?

12:22.181 --> 12:25.884
Actually, I ate it.
Sorry, it's my cheat day.

12:26.986 --> 12:29.421
Oh, well, that's okay,
but what am I having?

12:29.455 --> 12:32.042
Oh-ho... wouldn't you like to know?

12:32.125 --> 12:36.061
Yes! Yes, I would like to know!

12:36.096 --> 12:40.399
And, I believe, the defense rests.

12:41.501 --> 12:44.031
Well, that was a disaster!

12:44.738 --> 12:48.040
Mr. Walker, I suggest that
you get your affairs in order.

12:48.075 --> 12:50.009
Let's take a break.

12:50.043 --> 12:51.844
All right, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

12:51.878 --> 12:53.846
Lady Justice is just breakin' for lunch!

12:56.817 --> 12:59.689
Riley, you have to do something.
I can't go back to jail!

12:59.753 --> 13:02.288
I've already done my screw
you tour of Cell Block C,

13:02.322 --> 13:05.085
plus I gave away my
shampoo and my lucky shiv!

13:06.460 --> 13:08.962
Brad, I am so sorry.
If only she'd allowed us

13:08.996 --> 13:10.796
to postpone, we wouldn't be...

13:11.566 --> 13:13.133
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:13.167 --> 13:14.719
I have to go to the office,
I will be right back.

13:14.745 --> 13:15.427
What, what, what?

13:16.671 --> 13:18.185
Bon-Bon, what am I gonna do?

13:18.206 --> 13:21.508
Prison is such a cold and lonely
place, and my life is so empty!

13:21.543 --> 13:23.977
Even with the badminton
tournament comin' up.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.412
I know, I know.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.550
Oh, my God. Brad!

13:29.584 --> 13:32.719
Brad! We are completely alone.

13:32.754 --> 13:35.080
No one came to take you back to lockup!

13:35.223 --> 13:36.757
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

13:36.791 --> 13:37.787
Well, I was thinking
that my life is

13:37.887 --> 13:40.248
pretty much over,
but sure, why not?

13:40.295 --> 13:42.229
No, no, not now!

13:42.264 --> 13:45.032
No. No. I'm busting you out of here.

13:45.066 --> 13:47.456
Just put your head down and
keep going until I say stop.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.950
And if we make it out of here
alive, get used to hearing that.

13:55.066 --> 13:58.058
Problem solved! The Baby Place
said the baker is gone for the day

13:58.158 --> 13:59.274
but they'd send something else instead.

13:59.374 --> 14:00.808
There should be a box here any second.

14:00.842 --> 14:03.510
Oh, man, the anxiety's killin' me.

14:03.545 --> 14:05.612
I knew I never should've
gone behind Riley's back.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.581
Dude, it's your kid, too.
You have the right to know

14:07.615 --> 14:09.483
whether it's comin'
out with a dingley-doo

14:09.517 --> 14:10.918
or a
vee-jingley-jay.

14:12.287 --> 14:14.588
Hi. Did the box come? They called
and said there was a box coming!

14:14.623 --> 14:16.757
Box? What box? Why would there be a box?

14:16.791 --> 14:18.318
Well, they called the office
and said it was on its way,

14:18.418 --> 14:20.018
so I ran all the way over
there before I realized

14:20.053 --> 14:21.621
they might be sending
it to the apartment.

14:21.721 --> 14:23.956
You should probably sit
down, you crazy pregnant lady.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.592
And we'll go look for
this mystery box of yours.

14:26.626 --> 14:28.494
Now, Danny. Let's go now.

14:29.896 --> 14:31.864
I thought she didn't want
to know the sex of the baby.

14:31.898 --> 14:33.966
Dude, her hormones are ragin' right now!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.668
I don't even know what she wants!

14:35.702 --> 14:37.610
Except I'm supposed
to know what she wants!

14:38.460 --> 14:40.227
Hey, she might know about the box...

14:40.261 --> 14:42.796
...but she obviously doesn't know
that we're the ones who called.

14:42.831 --> 14:45.132
I've got a box for a Riley Perrin.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.657
I'm Riley! It can be a boy's name, too.

14:46.757 --> 14:48.458
Thank you. See you later.

14:48.492 --> 14:51.127
Okay, and you're sure they
said it was coming here?

14:51.161 --> 14:53.262
All right, I'll go check my apartment.

14:53.297 --> 14:54.864
Hold on.

14:54.898 --> 14:57.467
Riley Perrin?

14:57.501 --> 15:00.126
Oh, my God, yes, thank
you! You saved my life!

15:08.346 --> 15:11.281
- Mrs. Wheeler?
- Oh! Riley! Hi!

15:11.315 --> 15:14.718
Um, I, um... I just slipped
in here to check on Emma.

15:14.752 --> 15:17.954
I got it! I got the box.
Brad's gonna go free!

15:17.989 --> 15:20.834
What? Really? Oh, my God,
Riley, that's amazing!

15:20.892 --> 15:25.095
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy!

15:27.465 --> 15:29.199
Oh, my God!

15:29.234 --> 15:30.782
Brad, what are you doing here?

15:30.935 --> 15:34.041
Well, you know, it seemed
like you were gonna lose, so...

15:35.807 --> 15:37.728
So you broke him out?

15:38.109 --> 15:40.711
You're right... she is totally not cool.

15:40.745 --> 15:41.979
I know.

15:47.686 --> 15:50.187
Lady Justice is in the house!

15:50.222 --> 15:52.356
Call her up to sue your spouse!

15:52.390 --> 15:54.643
Man, I'm
killin' it out there!

15:55.093 --> 15:57.428
I'm about to kill you in here.

15:57.462 --> 15:59.421
What do you think you're
doin' out there, upstaging me.

15:59.521 --> 16:01.655
It's called the Lady Justice Show,

16:01.690 --> 16:04.024
not the Stupid,
Wise-crackin' Sidekick Show.

16:04.059 --> 16:07.037
Who'd ever watch a show
with a dumb name like that?

16:08.063 --> 16:09.697
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

16:09.732 --> 16:10.832
I'll... I'll
pull it back.

16:10.866 --> 16:13.067
Please. I really need this job.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.837
Finish up your day and
then you're on your way.

16:15.871 --> 16:18.673
Ooh, I like that.

16:18.707 --> 16:19.914
Maybe I can work that in.

16:22.144 --> 16:23.711
What? Whoa!

16:23.746 --> 16:26.309
That is... Is that a
quarter on the floor?

16:26.415 --> 16:27.982
Oh, my God.

16:33.556 --> 16:36.448
I'm bettin' right now you wish
you'd done a few more squats.

16:39.862 --> 16:41.363
Okay. I'm gonna do it.

16:41.397 --> 16:42.931
Wait, wait, wa. Dude, dude, dude.

16:42.966 --> 16:45.501
Now that it's here a second time, I
feel like maybe we shouldn't open it.

16:46.002 --> 16:47.971
And this is something you
should be sharing with Riley.

16:47.971 --> 16:50.372
And more importantly, it doesn't
matter if it's a boy or a girl,

16:50.406 --> 16:52.641
just as long as it's healthy.

16:52.675 --> 16:54.276
I don't care, I gotta know.

16:56.346 --> 16:58.413
Wait. What is this?

16:59.883 --> 17:01.415
Luis Bustamonte?

17:01.718 --> 17:05.054
Oh, no. This is the box of evidence
that Riley's been waiting for.

17:05.088 --> 17:06.622
We've gotta get to the courthouse.

17:06.656 --> 17:07.835
Okay, but if Riley
finds out, I'm on

17:07.861 --> 17:09.102
the record for giving
you that speech.

17:14.198 --> 17:16.165
Yo, the judge is here.

17:18.135 --> 17:20.970
Okay, let's put this gavel to the metal

17:21.003 --> 17:22.371
and get this trial started.

17:25.776 --> 17:27.710
You want me to rap,
you want me to rhyme,

17:27.744 --> 17:30.006
well, this is my courtroom
and I ain't got the...

17:31.749 --> 17:34.084
- Time?
- Oh, yeah. I was gonna say that.

17:35.186 --> 17:37.521
Look, help a sister out,
I'll let you back in.

17:37.555 --> 17:39.322
Really? I can have the job?

17:39.357 --> 17:41.091
Mm.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.860
Hey, order in the court.
I'm back in the hizzy,

17:43.895 --> 17:46.263
she said I got the job, and
you know y'all missed me.

17:49.801 --> 17:52.936
Well, let's get this
trainwreck over with.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.802
Wait. Where's the train?

17:54.873 --> 17:56.440
Your Honor! Your Honor, I'm here,

17:56.474 --> 17:58.275
and I've got it, I've got the box.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.613
Oh. And where's the defendant?

18:00.713 --> 18:05.416
Here I am! Here I am. Sorry,
I, uh, just dropped a contact.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.497
You never know where
they're gonna roll off to.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.824
Your Honor, this box will
show that Brad Walker is

18:12.859 --> 18:15.460
a relatively innocent man.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.296
All right, I would like to
present into evidence this...

18:18.331 --> 18:20.866
- Riley!
- Oh, my God.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.702
What is going on?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.137
We're havin' a boy.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.952
Oh, my God, we're havin' a boy!

18:29.309 --> 18:31.343
We are?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.245
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.062
We're gonna have a son.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.816
I love you.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.987
A boy.

18:42.022 --> 18:44.123
This is amazing!

18:44.157 --> 18:47.493
Finally... someone will know my pain!

18:49.029 --> 18:50.730
Well, this...

18:50.764 --> 18:52.688
This all could not be sweeter.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.769
But, um... Hello! I am
on trial for my life here!

18:56.803 --> 18:57.805
Oh, right, um...

18:57.905 --> 18:59.472
Oh, I believe this one is yours.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.073
Slight mix-up, all your fault.

19:01.108 --> 19:02.574
Don't worry, you can apologize later.

19:04.378 --> 19:06.279
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's all here.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.847
It's all here! Everything!

19:07.881 --> 19:11.613
Names, dates, times proving
that my client didn't do

19:11.713 --> 19:16.283
almost everything he was
accused of, just, in your face!

19:16.318 --> 19:20.521
Is where I would like to
respectfully place these papers.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.559
Okay. Uh... well.

19:24.593 --> 19:26.894
In light of this
evidence, I have no choice

19:26.929 --> 19:28.663
but to set you free.

19:28.697 --> 19:33.501
However, I cannot free you from
these lunatics that you call family.

19:33.535 --> 19:36.437
Ooh! May God have mercy on your soul.

19:42.578 --> 19:44.712
And with the new facts come to light,

19:44.747 --> 19:47.248
the strong defense wins the fight.

19:47.282 --> 19:48.750
Our man Brad is free to go.

19:48.784 --> 19:51.641
This is the Lady Justice Show, y'all.

19:57.938 --> 20:00.486
- Well, cheers to you Riley.
- Thanks.

20:01.077 --> 20:02.845
I am pretty proud of myself.

20:02.879 --> 20:06.048
Though, no thanks to any of the
idiots who live in this place.

20:06.082 --> 20:07.583
You think they would be
at least a little more

20:07.617 --> 20:09.318
supportive of someone
who's nine months pregnant.

20:09.352 --> 20:11.188
Well, unfortunately,
I don't think this

20:11.214 --> 20:13.049
is gonna make them
any more respectful.

20:18.027 --> 20:20.381
Sadly, they get to take theirs off.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.831
You get to take yours
off in a few weeks.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.233
Oh, who am I kidding?

20:24.267 --> 20:26.435
You're probably never
losing half of that.

20:26.469 --> 20:28.938
What if it's sooner than a few weeks?

20:28.972 --> 20:30.472
How much sooner?

20:30.507 --> 20:31.807
Aah, like right now!

20:31.841 --> 20:33.442
Oh God, I think I'm having a baby!

20:33.476 --> 20:34.510
- Oh, my God!
- Now?

20:34.544 --> 20:36.356
Now? It's happening,
she's having a baby!

20:36.846 --> 20:38.581
Someone get the door! Get the door!

20:43.720 --> 20:46.989
Oh, my God! And remember, whatever
drugs they offer, take 'em!
