Do you know where you are, Valdez?

00:17.760 --> 00:21.000
-East Germany, sir.
-Impossible.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.560
How can you be in a country
that doesn't exist.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.800
Excuse me, sir?

00:25.200 --> 00:28.080
The United States government doesn't recognize
East Germany as a country,

00:28.160 --> 00:29.760
let alone East Berlin as its capital.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.800
-Of course not...
-It is a matter of diplomatic theology...

00:33.200 --> 00:36.040
that Berlin is a single city
under Four Power control.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.360
-This here is the Soviet sector.
-Right.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.080
And after World War II Germany
was divided into four sectors,

00:41.160 --> 00:42.520
and the city of Berlin again
into four sectors:

00:42.600 --> 00:44.720
the American, British,
French and Russian, sir.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.360
Oh, and just to clear up
another common misunderstanding:

00:47.760 --> 00:50.240
West Berlin is not on the border
of West Germany,

00:50.320 --> 00:52.760
West Berlin is an island
inside of East Germany.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.760
I thought East Germany didn't exist.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.160
I like you, kid.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.520
This... is the bubble.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.440
(Faint, isolated humming)

01:14.400 --> 01:16.160
The Bubble is the only place
in the Soviet sector

01:16.240 --> 01:18.920
where you can have
an open conversation about anything.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.920
You want to fight with your wife?
Go to the West.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.840

01:23.240 --> 01:26.680

01:27.080 --> 01:28.920
You want to swim naked?

01:29.320 --> 01:30.520
That you can do here.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.280
First because the all do that anyway.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.200
Second,
because the only time you'll ever know

01:34.600 --> 01:38.200
that an East German isn't wearing a wire
is when he's naked.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.240
Bottom line is when you're in the Soviet
sector you're on your best behavior.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.440
The walls have ears,
the neighbors are watching you,

01:44.520 --> 01:46.320
and anyone who approaches you first
has a reason.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.160
Because no one around here
is ever friendly without a reason.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.280

01:53.320 --> 01:54.640

01:56.800 --> 01:58.200

01:58.600 --> 02:00.360

02:00.760 --> 02:04.400

be much of a honeymoon, but...

02:05.120 --> 02:07.640
