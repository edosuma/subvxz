WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:04.290
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island we're

00:04.290 --> 00:11.849
back from the money pit and we hit a

00:11.849 --> 00:15.719
cabin it's a piece of metal any idea

00:15.719 --> 00:18.920
what it is it looks like a little tiny

00:18.920 --> 00:19.920
Oak Island

00:19.920 --> 00:21.830
John chatter is confident he's gonna go

00:21.830 --> 00:24.890
down at the bottom it's not if we can do

00:24.890 --> 00:28.220
it is how do we do

00:28.220 --> 00:32.119
you at the bottom of the south

00:32.119 --> 00:35.590
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:35.590 --> 00:37.250
where people have been looking for an

00:37.250 --> 00:40.310
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:40.310 --> 00:44.030
years so far they have found bits of

00:44.030 --> 00:47.610
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:47.610 --> 00:50.100
symbols carved into it

00:50.100 --> 00:51.530
a 17th century Spanish

00:51.530 --> 00:56.350
today six men have died trying to solve

00:56.350 --> 01:00.680
the mystery

01:00.680 --> 01:07.180
according to legend

01:07.180 --> 01:24.500
to die before the treasure can be found

01:24.500 --> 01:27.430
on Oak Island the progress gained by a

01:27.430 --> 01:30.820
warm summer is rapidly giving way to the

01:30.820 --> 01:36.510
harsh uncertainties of fall and another

01:36.510 --> 01:40.550
season of both promise and progress is

01:40.550 --> 01:49.729
rapidly coming to an end

01:49.729 --> 02:00.090
it is this reality that time is running

02:00.090 --> 02:03.020
out which confronts brothers Rick and

02:03.020 --> 02:06.900
Marty lagina each and every day it is a

02:06.900 --> 02:08.220
reality

02:08.220 --> 02:11.249
they and their partners refuse to accept

02:11.249 --> 02:13.620
as they continue to search the island

02:13.620 --> 02:15.810
for the clues that will help them solve

02:15.810 --> 02:18.439
on 220 year old mystery

02:18.439 --> 02:25.319
yeah you're fun because that much with

02:25.319 --> 02:28.379
both his brother and Craig tester away

02:28.379 --> 02:31.170
on business Rick lagina is determined to

02:31.170 --> 02:33.319
make the most out of the few weeks he

02:33.319 --> 02:34.319
has left

02:34.319 --> 02:38.360
these guys to rig up and yeah start

02:38.360 --> 02:40.980
putting steel in there go

02:40.980 --> 02:42.319
why should you be optimistic about the

02:42.319 --> 02:44.239
lagina brothers cuz of Rick lagina she's

02:44.239 --> 02:45.540
not gonna give up

02:45.540 --> 02:48.370
he's not gonna give up he's smart he's

02:48.370 --> 02:51.450
capable and he's dedicated and he's

02:51.450 --> 02:52.450
intense

02:52.450 --> 02:54.799
I've been on this rollercoaster ride

02:54.799 --> 02:57.459
autopilot for eight years now and it's

02:57.459 --> 03:00.549
important to persevere and and to move

03:00.549 --> 03:03.549
forward in the solidus hey guys

03:03.549 --> 03:06.840
John Hart oh yeah one week ago in a

03:06.840 --> 03:09.349
last-ditch effort to find a diver who

03:09.349 --> 03:12.680
can get to the bottom of borehole 10x

03:12.680 --> 03:15.650
Rick and his brother Marty arranged for

03:15.650 --> 03:18.629
John Chatterton to come to Oak Island a

03:18.629 --> 03:26.469
world-renowned diver chatter dan has

03:26.469 --> 03:29.159
made numerous deepwater discoveries and

03:29.159 --> 03:30.900
faced some of the most dangerous

03:30.900 --> 03:36.779
conditions imaginable or at least as far

03:36.779 --> 03:38.769
as is humanly bus

03:38.769 --> 03:43.180
we can't wait to if this started awesome

03:43.180 --> 03:46.790
now on the eve of the dive that may

03:46.790 --> 03:49.090
finally provide some much hope for

03:49.090 --> 03:52.390
answers about 10x Rick and members of

03:52.390 --> 03:55.489
his team are making one more attempt to

03:55.489 --> 03:57.839
also get information from the place

03:57.839 --> 04:00.089
where the Oak Island treasure hunt began

04:00.089 --> 04:04.150
the money pit that's a big drill here

04:04.150 --> 04:05.859
you know today should be exciting

04:05.859 --> 04:07.829
Charles Barkhouse the guy who knows

04:07.829 --> 04:10.309
everything about Oak Island his pick

04:10.309 --> 04:12.739
spot in the money pit area he's put X on

04:12.739 --> 04:15.449
the drum just based on my research that

04:15.449 --> 04:16.829
I've done I've never believed that the

04:16.829 --> 04:18.608
money pit was where a lot of people

04:18.608 --> 04:19.949
claim it to be I think it's to the

04:19.949 --> 04:23.860
northwest but this is a spotted thing

04:23.860 --> 04:27.300
one year ago Rick Craig tester and Dave

04:27.300 --> 04:30.050
Blankenship located what they believe to

04:30.050 --> 04:32.280
be the original money pit

04:32.280 --> 04:34.700
after finding evidence of a mysterious

04:34.700 --> 04:37.050
wooden vault that was first discovered

04:37.050 --> 04:39.220
by treasure hunters William Chappell and

04:39.220 --> 04:42.590
Frederick Blair in 1897 definitely got

04:42.590 --> 04:43.590
wood

04:43.590 --> 04:46.620
that's definitely clay

04:46.620 --> 04:48.030
that's what they found the top of the

04:48.030 --> 04:51.230
mall

04:51.230 --> 04:53.720
today they will be drilling at a spot

04:53.720 --> 04:57.289
just north of last year's drill site a

04:57.289 --> 04:59.410
spot that Oak Island historian Charles

04:59.410 --> 05:02.500
Barkhouse believes is not just near the

05:02.500 --> 05:05.479
money pit but the actual place where the

05:05.479 --> 05:09.460
Oak Island treasure was buried what

05:09.460 --> 05:11.660
makes you so sure it's here I don't know

05:11.660 --> 05:13.759
David you know there's no reference

05:13.759 --> 05:16.919
point you can take it off on this whole

05:16.919 --> 05:19.030
topography has changed right this was

05:19.030 --> 05:22.770
all bulldozed up here right so it's the

05:22.770 --> 05:23.770
belief the feeling just everything that

05:23.770 --> 05:24.840
I've looked at over

05:24.840 --> 05:30.510
I just feel it's over this way

05:30.510 --> 05:32.570
because the area is highly susceptible

05:32.570 --> 05:35.590
to flooding and the ground is unstable

05:35.590 --> 05:37.720
due to centuries of digging and

05:37.720 --> 05:40.240
tunneling any full-scale effort to

05:40.240 --> 05:42.900
excavate the money pit down to a depth

05:42.900 --> 05:46.550
of approximately 150 feet is estimated

05:46.550 --> 05:51.780
to cost in the millions of dollars and

05:51.780 --> 05:54.570
so far Rick's brother Marty and their

05:54.570 --> 05:56.659
partners have been reluctant to invest

05:56.659 --> 05:59.310
that kind of money unless solid evidence

05:59.310 --> 06:01.860
can be found that such a huge financial

06:01.860 --> 06:03.099
effort would be worth it

06:03.099 --> 06:06.770
total depth we're talking 200 we're

06:06.770 --> 06:09.789
looking for a void and or whatever let's

06:09.789 --> 06:11.659
find something let's do it today let's

06:11.659 --> 06:17.990
make today to the day Rick is going to

06:17.990 --> 06:20.080
try and find evidence of the original

06:20.080 --> 06:22.620
money pit by using a drilling system

06:22.620 --> 06:26.500
called a cyclone reverse circulation or

06:26.500 --> 06:29.490
cyclone drilling is a method that uses a

06:29.490 --> 06:32.389
pneumatic piston or hammer which forces

06:32.389 --> 06:34.699
air into a hole while water is

06:34.699 --> 06:38.550
simultaneously pumped in any objects and

06:38.550 --> 06:41.540
possible treasure that are in the hole

06:41.540 --> 06:42.960
are then forced up to the surface and

06:42.960 --> 06:46.210
collected in a sample bag

06:46.210 --> 06:58.810
there's a big sea wood could this be

06:58.810 --> 07:00.949
evidence of another mysterious wooden

07:00.949 --> 07:03.699
vault similar to the one that Rick and

07:03.699 --> 07:09.210
his partners discovered last year

07:09.210 --> 07:10.840
Charles comes up with this piece of wood

07:10.840 --> 07:13.939
dan is long told me black wood

07:13.939 --> 07:16.879
foul-smelling is probably really really

07:16.879 --> 07:17.879
old

07:17.879 --> 07:19.039
could it be original works

07:19.039 --> 07:22.759
researcher funnel could be trimming from

07:22.759 --> 07:28.340
the money pit could be could be could be

07:28.340 --> 07:30.860
save this Rick is determined to find

07:30.860 --> 07:32.750
something more in the drill hole than

07:32.750 --> 07:35.919
just old bits of wood really what we're

07:35.919 --> 07:38.729
looking for is evidence of

07:38.729 --> 07:40.409
Madeline's really would

07:40.409 --> 07:43.729
a great thing he knows all too well the

07:43.729 --> 07:46.240
tricks that Oak Island likes to play on

07:46.240 --> 07:48.610
would-be treasure hunters and he has

07:48.610 --> 07:51.430
also invested too much time money and

07:51.430 --> 07:53.949
sweat to walk away with nothing more

07:53.949 --> 07:56.219
than a few chips of wood from what could

07:56.219 --> 07:57.910
be an old searcher tunnel

07:57.910 --> 07:58.910
just ask Cody they're gonna go down with

07:58.910 --> 07:59.910
all casing because we're

07:59.910 --> 08:00.910
stand up a couple things drill faster

08:00.910 --> 08:01.910
you'll be able

08:01.910 --> 08:02.910
figure out if he actually does hit a

08:02.910 --> 08:12.620
void where the top is where the bottom

08:12.620 --> 08:22.810
might be pull the rods up to worry about

08:22.810 --> 08:23.810
driving the casing pass

08:23.810 --> 08:24.900
get down about 160 feet and we hit

08:24.900 --> 08:27.759
bedrock no that's disappointing but it's

08:27.759 --> 08:30.539
typical Oak Island I'm thinking is that

08:30.539 --> 08:33.059
the end of the story there's no point in

08:33.059 --> 08:35.230
advancing casing through through Rock

08:35.230 --> 08:38.020
the holes are gonna stand up we had

08:38.020 --> 08:40.330
committed to 200 feet so we decided okay

08:40.330 --> 08:42.580
let's just drill all we're looking for

08:42.580 --> 08:44.950
are the returns and we'll the far fall

08:44.950 --> 08:46.870
into a point that's it it should be very

08:46.870 --> 08:47.870
simple

08:47.870 --> 09:16.050
the colors going against our

09:16.050 --> 09:22.144
causes a surge is like done

09:22.144 --> 09:26.350
a seven foot drop 160 feet deep inside

09:26.350 --> 09:29.490
the money pit when the mysterious wooden

09:29.490 --> 09:31.680
vault was first discovered by William

09:31.680 --> 09:35.240
Chappell and Frederick Blair in 1897

09:35.240 --> 09:37.720
their records indicated that it was

09:37.720 --> 09:41.750
approximately 7 feet high due to the

09:41.750 --> 09:42.750
fact that their drill bits met with no

09:42.750 --> 09:45.790
resistance and turned up no debris for

09:45.790 --> 09:48.430
that amount of depth it appeared the

09:48.430 --> 09:50.510
vault had been covered in a type of

09:50.510 --> 09:53.370
concrete and then sealed with clay and

09:53.370 --> 09:56.210
it was also in this vault where one of

09:56.210 --> 09:58.130
the drill bits recovered a small

09:58.130 --> 10:01.630
fragment of paper with writing on it

10:01.630 --> 10:04.080
unfortunately shortly after the wooden

10:04.080 --> 10:07.000
vault was discovered efforts to dig down

10:07.000 --> 10:09.380
and retrieve it were plagued by constant

10:09.380 --> 10:12.760
flooding and the operation was abandoned

10:12.760 --> 10:15.950
due to lack of mine

10:15.950 --> 10:23.850
prior 178 178 so they draw from 171

10:23.850 --> 10:29.120
to 178 and still dropping it's still

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
dropping

10:30.120 --> 10:36.280
he said it drops from 171 to 178

10:36.280 --> 10:39.700
could this really be proof that what

10:39.700 --> 10:41.910
Rick and his partners have discovered is

10:41.910 --> 10:45.270
another wooden vault located even deeper

10:45.270 --> 10:48.650
than the so-called Chappell vault and if

10:48.650 --> 11:03.060
so what is inside it

11:03.060 --> 11:15.190
you

11:15.190 --> 11:17.470
drilling in the area of the money pit

11:17.470 --> 11:20.000
Rick lagina along with Charles Barkhouse

11:20.000 --> 11:22.770
and Dave Blankenship have just located a

11:22.770 --> 11:26.830
large board 171 feet deep below the

11:26.830 --> 11:28.050
surface of Oak Island

11:28.050 --> 11:34.420
as I left that blow for a second cause

11:34.420 --> 11:36.230
if there's any larger man itself in my

11:36.230 --> 11:37.230
fuck

11:37.230 --> 11:43.410
does that mean we hit the cavity or what

11:43.410 --> 11:47.340
see how far she cops

11:47.340 --> 11:49.890
we hit a cavity I mean Jordan says you

11:49.890 --> 11:52.180
know first at 7 feet the bars falling

11:52.180 --> 11:53.930
you know you're watching the bar and

11:53.930 --> 11:57.660
it's going down and down and down and

11:57.660 --> 11:59.800
down

11:59.800 --> 12:06.210
192 to bottom

12:06.210 --> 12:12.620
71 to 192

12:12.620 --> 12:16.900
twenty-one feet

12:16.900 --> 12:22.390
a 21-foot deep cavity 171 feet

12:22.390 --> 12:25.240
underground could this actually be

12:25.240 --> 12:28.060
evidence of a man-made treasure chamber

12:28.060 --> 12:29.640
deep within Oak Island

12:29.640 --> 12:39.950
what's a 21-foot hi cavity doing below

12:39.950 --> 12:43.350
the anhydrate no indication of what it

12:43.350 --> 12:44.730
may or may not be

12:44.730 --> 12:46.620
I can't drill the bottom because there's

12:46.620 --> 12:49.810
too much blood or that air hammer won't

12:49.810 --> 12:53.000
cycle I think we should pull off change

12:53.000 --> 12:56.190
bits to a trichome drill ass up in that

12:56.190 --> 12:57.640
hole fires will drill another 20 feet

12:57.640 --> 13:01.560
that way debris can go down into a stop

13:01.560 --> 13:13.950
it'll give it a place to go to

13:13.950 --> 13:20.370
so we're sifting through the returns in

13:20.370 --> 13:22.550
the trailer I'll be honest I'm looking

13:22.550 --> 13:26.120
for a little round coin I'll get this

13:26.120 --> 13:27.270
clean suits

13:27.270 --> 13:30.740
I'm thinking just one just one time just

13:30.740 --> 13:32.050
one just something

13:32.050 --> 13:42.130
having accumulated more wood and muddy

13:42.130 --> 13:44.050
sediment from the cyclone extractor

13:44.050 --> 13:48.060
Rickman Charles and Dave Blankenship

13:48.060 --> 13:50.450
prepared one loaded into the backhoe to

13:50.450 --> 13:52.380
be scanned for any important evidence

13:52.380 --> 13:59.080
sand and clay heavy it is heavier to

13:59.080 --> 14:01.040
save the returns I mean that's always

14:01.040 --> 14:03.570
appropriate that you want to know what

14:03.570 --> 14:04.570
you drill through

14:04.570 --> 14:11.140
just up the hill from the money pit dave

14:11.140 --> 14:13.580
blankenship dumps the sediment on a hard

14:13.580 --> 14:16.190
flat ground so that it can be scanned

14:16.190 --> 14:24.480
with a metal detector

14:24.480 --> 14:27.170
using the mine lab 3030 metal detector

14:27.170 --> 14:29.550
jack begley begins scanning over the

14:29.550 --> 14:32.180
sediment to see if any metallic objects

14:32.180 --> 14:34.440
or artifacts may have come from the

14:34.440 --> 14:35.980
large underground void

14:35.980 --> 14:46.080
shortly after I start detecting I get a

14:46.080 --> 14:52.910
a hit

14:52.910 --> 14:55.090
after getting a hit indicating the

14:55.090 --> 14:57.240
presence of a non-ferrous or possibly

14:57.240 --> 15:00.370
precious metal Jack then uses a handheld

15:00.370 --> 15:03.380
metal detector known as a pin pointer to

15:03.380 --> 15:10.350
precisely isolate the object

15:10.350 --> 15:12.750
I've washed it off with water and looked

15:12.750 --> 15:15.630
at it in my hand and went well this is

15:15.630 --> 15:18.180
not natural this is absolutely not

15:18.180 --> 15:22.590
natural and it's not iron as Jack found

15:22.590 --> 15:25.640
an important clue a metallic object that

15:25.640 --> 15:29.510
came out of a large void 171 feet deep

15:29.510 --> 15:30.690
inside the money pit

15:30.690 --> 15:40.930
okay look what I found over there it's

15:40.930 --> 15:44.250
from your tailings pile it's a piece of

15:44.250 --> 15:52.090
metal any idea what it is not real it's

15:52.090 --> 15:58.200
not real heavy what's that in the center

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
okay

15:59.200 --> 16:00.200
what's those three marks down at the

16:00.200 --> 16:01.200
bottom see the three vertical marks

16:01.200 --> 16:04.840
right there see look three slashes we're

16:04.840 --> 16:06.800
down here on this end there's three

16:06.800 --> 16:09.280
vertical slashes right I just find it

16:09.280 --> 16:15.690
very true it looks like Oak Island like

16:15.690 --> 16:19.870
a little tiny Oak Island what what does

16:19.870 --> 16:22.820
it mean if you look here see the sheen

16:22.820 --> 16:25.610
there yeah and then there's something

16:25.610 --> 16:30.220
like it's overlay right a metal object

16:30.220 --> 16:33.480
and shaped like Oak Island look here

16:33.480 --> 16:35.930
could it be part of a larger ancient

16:35.930 --> 16:39.500
artifact or is it possible evidence of

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
treasure

16:40.500 --> 16:46.330
look here look on this side and then

16:46.330 --> 16:48.450
look look on edge rate this is one of

16:48.450 --> 16:50.710
those situations where try to figure it

16:50.710 --> 16:52.800
out until we get a definitive answer

16:52.800 --> 16:54.620
this is what it is or this is what it

16:54.620 --> 16:56.680
isn't and it was intriguing enough it

16:56.680 --> 16:58.760
was odd enough that we thought we would

16:58.760 --> 17:01.530
have to see what this thing's all about

17:01.530 --> 17:02.620
every clue is worth pursuing

17:02.620 --> 17:11.130
exactly call it a day

17:11.130 --> 17:14.630
look that's it's the money pit there

17:14.630 --> 17:18.520
supposed to be a vault treasure call it

17:18.520 --> 17:21.069
what you will if that doesn't beckon you

17:21.069 --> 17:22.069
forward

17:22.069 --> 17:24.609
if you can't listen to that beacon call

17:24.609 --> 17:27.060
it what are we doing think we'll do a

17:27.060 --> 17:29.090
little bit more discussion about this

17:29.090 --> 17:31.430
one I am getting to the bottom of that I

17:31.430 --> 17:34.540
don't care what it costs

17:34.540 --> 17:37.160
after finding a new piece of evidence

17:37.160 --> 17:39.630
and from a 21-foot void found deep

17:39.630 --> 17:43.000
inside the money pit Rick Marty and

17:43.000 --> 17:45.720
their partners are once again excited by

17:45.720 --> 17:47.690
the prospect of an incredible

17:47.690 --> 17:50.510
breakthrough but before they can go any

17:50.510 --> 17:53.640
farther or dig any deeper there is yet

17:53.640 --> 17:55.750
another mystery they need to solve

17:55.750 --> 18:01.520
and like the money pit it also lies deep

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
underground

18:02.520 --> 18:05.400
you

18:05.400 --> 18:15.430
for me it's it's always a big deal to

18:15.430 --> 18:17.570
remember the past the boat Oak Island so

18:17.570 --> 18:21.190
I want to thank you for coming

18:21.190 --> 18:22.800
while the team awaits the arrival of

18:22.800 --> 18:25.810
diver John Chatterton Rick lagina is

18:25.810 --> 18:27.670
bringing a special visitor to the island

18:27.670 --> 18:32.670
at 91 years of age Lynn Walsh is the

18:32.670 --> 18:36.530
granddaughter of Maynard Kaiser the man

18:36.530 --> 18:39.490
who in 1897 became the second victim of

18:39.490 --> 18:42.030
the infamous Oak Island curse when he

18:42.030 --> 18:44.620
fell to his death while working inside

18:44.620 --> 18:46.650
the money pit

18:46.650 --> 18:48.460
and joining her or her niece Sally

18:48.460 --> 18:54.010
Kaiser and her friend Blair I admit I

18:54.010 --> 18:57.000
don't know much about the tragedy that

18:57.000 --> 19:02.720
day tragedy happened I asked me he was

19:02.720 --> 19:04.430
around 47

19:04.430 --> 19:07.420
what do you recall from your family

19:07.420 --> 19:10.860
stories that he was looking for Captain

19:10.860 --> 19:14.500
Kidd's treasure and then of course we

19:14.500 --> 19:16.560
learned that it could be other things

19:16.560 --> 19:20.590
born in Canada

19:20.590 --> 19:22.790
Maynard Kaiser was a former officer in

19:22.790 --> 19:26.530
the British military in the late 1800s

19:26.530 --> 19:28.400
he brought his wife and three children

19:28.400 --> 19:31.170
to Nova Scotia in hopes of providing a

19:31.170 --> 19:34.720
new and prosperous life for them after

19:34.720 --> 19:36.870
hearing the rumors about a mysterious

19:36.870 --> 19:40.130
pirate treasure buried on Oak Island

19:40.130 --> 19:42.390
Kaiser eagerly joined the oak island

19:42.390 --> 19:45.030
treasure company led by Frederick Blair

19:45.030 --> 19:50.150
but on March 26th 1897 after a long day

19:50.150 --> 19:52.760
of working in the money pit the Kaiser

19:52.760 --> 19:55.020
was being lifted out when a cable

19:55.020 --> 19:56.020
suddenly snapped

19:56.020 --> 19:59.460
causing him to fall to his death more

19:59.460 --> 20:02.170
than 100 feet down to the bottom of the

20:02.170 --> 20:03.170
shaft

20:03.170 --> 20:08.740
we're now coming to the money pit itself

20:08.740 --> 20:22.890
so the area he would have been working

20:22.890 --> 20:25.930
in would have been a shaft about 12 feet

20:25.930 --> 20:28.430
in diameter it's not at all like I

20:28.430 --> 20:31.440
expected what were your expectations

20:31.440 --> 20:33.480
well I don't know a great big hole in

20:33.480 --> 20:37.340
there but the thought was that maybe we

20:37.340 --> 20:40.050
would be able to get on Oak Island and

20:40.050 --> 20:44.160
see the area and that was all I expected

20:44.160 --> 20:45.350
our grandfather

20:45.350 --> 20:48.740
spotty was never recovered or never

20:48.740 --> 20:51.540
found

20:51.540 --> 20:55.720
never found is it possible that Maynard

20:55.720 --> 20:58.270
kaisers bodies was not recovered after

20:58.270 --> 21:00.630
his fatal fall down to the bottom of the

21:00.630 --> 21:04.150
money pit and if so could it still be

21:04.150 --> 21:08.880
down there after more than 100 years

21:08.880 --> 21:10.820
we heard about how the water came back

21:10.820 --> 21:13.169
in you know because they thought well

21:13.169 --> 21:15.180
maybe his body washed it with the water

21:15.180 --> 21:18.400
so that was the mystery to them the

21:18.400 --> 21:21.420
water uh-huh yeah comes from over there

21:21.420 --> 21:25.880
I see a tunnel from Smith's Cove into

21:25.880 --> 21:27.790
the money pit introduced for the sole

21:27.790 --> 21:31.600
reason everyone believes protecting them

21:31.600 --> 21:34.360
exactly but that begs the question is

21:34.360 --> 21:39.400
there a backdoor a backdoor is it

21:39.400 --> 21:42.100
possible that Maynard kaisers body was

21:42.100 --> 21:44.600
washed out of the money pit into one of

21:44.600 --> 21:46.890
the flood tunnels deep beneath Oak

21:46.890 --> 21:50.590
Island and if so could there be a

21:50.590 --> 21:52.620
connection between Maynard kaisers

21:52.620 --> 21:55.300
missing remains and the mysterious dead

21:55.300 --> 21:59.100
body that supposedly lies just 180 feet

21:59.100 --> 22:05.830
away at the bottom of 10-x

22:05.830 --> 22:09.360
B his grave here and that too is

22:09.360 --> 22:12.220
something that you feel differently

22:12.220 --> 22:15.940
about and at least this emptiness yeah

22:15.940 --> 22:19.730
they can see but I understand there is a

22:19.730 --> 22:22.480
memorial there is and you know I'd love

22:22.480 --> 22:24.610
to take you down to it it's right across

22:24.610 --> 22:28.260
the causeway that would be fine

22:28.260 --> 22:31.220
what happened I was surprised how little

22:31.220 --> 22:35.190
information there is about that incident

22:35.190 --> 22:37.770
and thus I understand Lin's

22:37.770 --> 22:43.090
frustration

22:43.090 --> 22:47.160
makes it real you know the date is

22:47.160 --> 22:52.180
interesting too in 1995 to commemorate

22:52.180 --> 22:54.550
the two hundred year anniversary of the

22:54.550 --> 22:57.120
Oak Island treasure hunt dan Blankenship

22:57.120 --> 22:59.740
placed this memorial at the entrance to

22:59.740 --> 23:03.050
the island he wanted to pay respect to

23:03.050 --> 23:05.380
the six men who paid the ultimate price

23:05.380 --> 23:09.420
while in pursuit of an incredible dream

23:09.420 --> 23:11.810
to me in a small way it personalizes the

23:11.810 --> 23:14.410
story of Oak Island and it brings us

23:14.410 --> 23:15.410
some closure

23:15.410 --> 23:19.150
for her it was personal and just as

23:19.150 --> 23:22.760
important as what we're trying to do and

23:22.760 --> 23:26.610
I felt a little emotional connection to

23:26.610 --> 23:28.059
that

23:28.059 --> 23:29.990
it's important to her thus we'll make it

23:29.990 --> 23:32.930
important to us it's not over yet I

23:32.930 --> 23:35.890
commit to you that we will pursue this

23:35.890 --> 23:37.060
that's excellent

23:37.060 --> 23:44.510
well I didn't ever think I'd see it but

23:44.510 --> 23:47.540
I'm glad to see this this is nice we

23:47.540 --> 23:50.370
hope that we can change when it says the

23:50.370 --> 23:53.340
oak island quest will be the Oak Island

23:53.340 --> 24:00.929
solution and we will pursue trying to

24:00.929 --> 24:04.020
figure out what really happened I'm in

24:04.020 --> 24:07.280
trouble me from my forebears work you

24:07.280 --> 24:10.570
know I've been lost and in a pit on a

24:10.570 --> 24:14.610
strange Island I'd want answers to and I

24:14.610 --> 24:16.750
want to thank you all for coming

24:16.750 --> 24:20.960
we're the ones that are pre-shared truly

24:20.960 --> 24:24.270
I get a hug

24:24.270 --> 24:26.950
I truly appreciate everything that

24:26.950 --> 24:30.179
you've done to help us to at least

24:30.179 --> 24:32.220
anticipate an answer we'll do our very

24:32.220 --> 24:33.220
best

24:33.220 --> 24:37.309
you

24:37.309 --> 24:48.140

24:48.140 --> 24:49.140
eyes

24:49.140 --> 24:52.420
well you know this is a fascinating dive

24:52.420 --> 24:55.740
project it's right up our alley

24:55.740 --> 24:58.520
challenging renowned diver John

24:58.520 --> 25:00.640
Chatterton along with his business

25:00.640 --> 25:03.809
partner and dive supervisor Howard

25:03.809 --> 25:05.970
Ehrenburg have finally arrived on Oak

25:05.970 --> 25:09.130
Island if anybody can get us answers to

25:09.130 --> 25:10.890
the long sought-after question of what's

25:10.890 --> 25:13.070
in the bottom of 10x we believe that you

25:13.070 --> 25:15.560
guys are gonna be able to do it for us

25:15.560 --> 25:17.960
putting a dive together like this is

25:17.960 --> 25:21.810
literally like solving a puzzle it's not

25:21.810 --> 25:24.300
if we can do it it's how do we do it

25:24.300 --> 25:27.120
that I like to hear but it's the truth

25:27.120 --> 25:29.710
is it's it's how and you know from our

25:29.710 --> 25:32.010
collective experience we've got the

25:32.010 --> 25:33.950
experience we've got the equipment we've

25:33.950 --> 25:35.850
got the education we've got the right

25:35.850 --> 25:41.450
guys right team and we're gonna get down

25:41.450 --> 25:42.450
there

25:42.450 --> 25:43.850
those are the best words we've heard in

25:43.850 --> 25:47.350
a long time right David yep

25:47.350 --> 25:49.630
with over 30 years of experience as a

25:49.630 --> 25:52.510
commercial rat diver working in deep and

25:52.510 --> 25:55.840
confined underwater structures John

25:55.840 --> 25:57.590
chatter dense determination to explore

25:57.590 --> 26:00.350
the unknown has taken him to some of the

26:00.350 --> 26:03.220
most famous and infamous shipwrecks in

26:03.220 --> 26:06.850
the world from the Britannic to the

26:06.850 --> 26:13.720
Lusitania the Andrea Doria and even the

26:13.720 --> 26:14.980
Titanic

26:14.980 --> 26:18.110
giving all our difficulties and our

26:18.110 --> 26:20.390
trials and tribulations with 10x to this

26:20.390 --> 26:23.790
point it's been difficult to say the

26:23.790 --> 26:26.170
least and now with John Chatterton and

26:26.170 --> 26:28.540
his team arriving one thing comes to

26:28.540 --> 26:32.790
mind they exude confidence this is our

26:32.790 --> 26:35.710
war room here's where you've got

26:35.710 --> 26:38.100
questions we've got answers awesome if

26:38.100 --> 26:40.360
this is gonna get done they're gonna do

26:40.360 --> 26:41.360
it

26:41.360 --> 26:44.070
hi I'm Jack Jack how you doing I don't

26:44.070 --> 26:46.210
think we've ever had that confidence

26:46.210 --> 26:48.730
level David you want to get Marty Craig

26:48.730 --> 26:51.940
as the team prepares to review scanning

26:51.940 --> 26:54.370
sonar data obtained from the underground

26:54.370 --> 26:58.320
chamber at the bottom of 10x Marty

26:58.320 --> 27:01.210
lagina and Craig tester join the meeting

27:01.210 --> 27:03.960
via videoconference from their offices

27:03.960 --> 27:07.960
in Traverse City Michigan respectively

27:07.960 --> 27:10.530
John Chatterton our Nierenberg how you

27:10.530 --> 27:12.800
doing guys you know why we're here

27:12.800 --> 27:15.090
God's gonna happen tomorrow we wanted to

27:15.090 --> 27:16.890
come out there but I understand the

27:16.890 --> 27:18.180
weather isn't cooperating - well it's

27:18.180 --> 27:19.980
was the deteriorate is that right well

27:19.980 --> 27:21.530
according to the weatherman it's the

27:21.530 --> 27:23.530
most rain he's there and wind he's ever

27:23.530 --> 27:26.190
forecast that doesn't sound good flying

27:26.190 --> 27:27.190
weather

27:27.190 --> 27:29.250
no it's gonna be bad but they don't care

27:29.250 --> 27:31.390
as a matter of fact I like it when the

27:31.390 --> 27:32.780
surface weather is a little bit

27:32.780 --> 27:34.600
challenging because I feel like I'm

27:34.600 --> 27:39.000
getting away with something know what

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
we're doing

27:40.000 --> 27:42.250
we're gonna we're gonna make it happen

27:42.250 --> 27:47.490
that is exciting as well I mean that was

27:47.490 --> 27:52.731
our goal for this year was to get to the

27:52.731 --> 27:53.731
bottom of that bloody 10x and see what

27:53.731 --> 27:54.731
is in that chamber I mean there's a

27:54.731 --> 27:55.731
chamber there for sure it has things in

27:55.731 --> 27:56.731
it for sure but we just don't know what

27:56.731 --> 27:58.030
they are

27:58.030 --> 27:59.460
Jack can you bring up some of these

27:59.460 --> 28:00.720
sonar image yeah

28:00.720 --> 28:03.170
so we're gonna start out with the

28:03.170 --> 28:05.080
wireframe model that Brian Abbott made

28:05.080 --> 28:11.070
oh wow that's awesome in order to help

28:11.070 --> 28:13.560
John Chatterton familiarize himself with

28:13.560 --> 28:16.840
the bottom of 10x the team is reviewing

28:16.840 --> 28:19.040
the scanning sonar data collected

28:19.040 --> 28:22.290
earlier this year it indicates were

28:22.290 --> 28:25.360
possible tunnels to vertical wooden

28:25.360 --> 28:29.510
posts a treasure chest and even human

28:29.510 --> 28:34.170
remains lied 235 feet underground this

28:34.170 --> 28:37.350
is really valuable information and

28:37.350 --> 28:40.130
obviously we can prioritize what's

28:40.130 --> 28:42.750
important to you guys but so far we

28:42.750 --> 28:46.250
haven't seen anything that makes us feel

28:46.250 --> 28:52.630
anything but there was no sense of well

28:52.630 --> 28:55.179
this may get done it may not get done

28:55.179 --> 28:57.809
you know there an issue may come up

28:57.809 --> 28:58.860
there was none of that

28:58.860 --> 28:59.860
you're obviously probably the most

28:59.860 --> 29:00.860
accomplished diver in the world but I

29:00.860 --> 29:02.680
mean I've nothing like what you're doing

29:02.680 --> 29:06.090
but I mean that the 27-inch hole where

29:06.090 --> 29:09.930
the drill bar stuck in it is okay with

29:09.930 --> 29:12.590
you although John chatter net is

29:12.590 --> 29:13.700
confident that he will be able to make

29:13.700 --> 29:16.000
his way to the bottom of 10x

29:16.000 --> 29:19.090
through the narrow 27-inch wide shaft it

29:19.090 --> 29:21.870
remains to be seen if the 20-foot drill

29:21.870 --> 29:24.580
bar that is wedged inside might prove to

29:24.580 --> 29:26.799
be a dangerous and impassable

29:26.799 --> 29:27.799
obstruction

29:27.799 --> 29:32.980
I have pipes I have I've had to navigate

29:32.980 --> 29:35.750
past butterfly valves and this is a

29:35.750 --> 29:41.150
relatively modest depth yes we're gonna

29:41.150 --> 29:46.350
use umbilicals hot water I'm gonna go

29:46.350 --> 29:47.940
into the chamber we're gonna have

29:47.940 --> 29:52.910
another diver in water it's a tender you

29:52.910 --> 29:55.470
know I'm gonna be wearing steel-toed

29:55.470 --> 29:59.020
boots and if I have to move around on

29:59.020 --> 30:00.540
the bottom I'm literally gonna be

30:00.540 --> 30:02.400
walking around

30:02.400 --> 30:04.320
to ensure that he will have as much

30:04.320 --> 30:07.170
maneuverability as possible John will be

30:07.170 --> 30:10.170
diving in only a wetsuit it will be

30:10.170 --> 30:12.450
fitted with an umbilical hose that will

30:12.450 --> 30:14.880
continuously pump hot water through the

30:14.880 --> 30:17.270
suit in order to keep him reasonably

30:17.270 --> 30:20.270
warm in the otherwise Bridget 40 degree

30:20.270 --> 30:23.480
water both John and his fellow diver

30:23.480 --> 30:26.130
Mike hunt Lou will also be wearing Kirby

30:26.130 --> 30:28.490
Morgan helmets which will be able to

30:28.490 --> 30:31.010
feed them a combination of oxygen

30:31.010 --> 30:34.929
nitrogen and helium also known as trimix

30:34.929 --> 30:38.110
the helmets are also equipped with live

30:38.110 --> 30:40.800
voice and video feeds all of which will

30:40.800 --> 30:43.210
be monitored by Howard Arenberg at the

30:43.210 --> 30:45.679
surface how long can you stay down with

30:45.679 --> 30:48.010
that we got a lot of Howard quits

30:48.010 --> 30:51.809
pumping Howard quits pumping gas down to

30:51.809 --> 30:55.559
me then I will come up but you should be

30:55.559 --> 30:57.380
able to walk around and investigate the

30:57.380 --> 31:00.060
bottom kind of fully oh absolutely

31:00.060 --> 31:03.081
absolutely and I found that the room

31:03.081 --> 31:05.800
exuded in confidence it was look here's

31:05.800 --> 31:08.340
the guy finally who's gonna do what we

31:08.340 --> 31:13.110
need done it's that simple we are

31:13.110 --> 31:14.520
holding our breath though that just

31:14.520 --> 31:17.120
patient let's get her done yeah

31:17.120 --> 31:18.120
see you guys

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
let's do this thing

31:19.120 --> 31:36.241
in spite of rain and the threat of a

31:36.241 --> 31:39.330
possible hurricane for Rick Marty and

31:39.330 --> 31:42.440
their partners today may go down as one

31:42.440 --> 31:45.010
of the most exciting and memorable they

31:45.010 --> 31:48.430
have had all summer sorry for the bad

31:48.430 --> 31:49.481
weather everything's going good

31:49.481 --> 31:50.481
everything's going to and splat in spite

31:50.481 --> 31:53.820
of the weather

31:53.820 --> 31:55.950
in John Chatterton they believed they

31:55.950 --> 31:58.000
have finally found the diver who can

31:58.000 --> 32:02.410
reach the bottom of borehole 10-x the

32:02.410 --> 32:05.030
reason why today is hold such promises

32:05.030 --> 32:07.669
simply because of the skill set and the

32:07.669 --> 32:11.350
capabilities of John and his team hours

32:11.350 --> 32:13.559
to dive supervisor he's gonna be

32:13.559 --> 32:16.100
coordinating everything if anybody has a

32:16.100 --> 32:18.919
question he's the guy to go to

32:18.919 --> 32:20.970
and Howard will be in communication with

32:20.970 --> 32:24.140
me okay so plan for with dive today he's

32:24.140 --> 32:26.420
gonna get in the basket we're gonna

32:26.420 --> 32:29.380
lower the basket to a water depth of 40

32:29.380 --> 32:31.309
feet assisting John Chatterton

32:31.309 --> 32:34.540
inside 10x we'll be safety diver Mike

32:34.540 --> 32:37.640
Conley and both will be able to have

32:37.640 --> 32:40.380
full communication with dive supervisor

32:40.380 --> 32:42.790
Howard Ehrenberg who will remain at the

32:42.790 --> 32:44.669
surface

32:44.669 --> 32:47.550
as John makes his way down he will enter

32:47.550 --> 32:49.790
the eight-foot-wide portion of the shaft

32:49.790 --> 32:53.350
feet first Mike will then follow him to

32:53.350 --> 32:57.010
the 181 foot level where he will remain

32:57.010 --> 32:59.580
while John continues his descent through

32:59.580 --> 33:01.919
the narrow 27-inch portion of the shaft

33:01.919 --> 33:04.860
if John should encounter any

33:04.860 --> 33:07.960
difficulties or dangerous obstructions

33:07.960 --> 33:09.910
like the 20 foot drill bar that is

33:09.910 --> 33:10.910
wedged at the 204 foot level Mike will

33:10.910 --> 33:17.360
be ready to help him who is the guy

33:17.360 --> 33:22.090
who's gonna be safe you're gonna be okay

33:22.090 --> 33:23.400
the window I'll give you crap I'll give

33:23.400 --> 33:25.030
you signals to take the basket up and

33:25.030 --> 33:27.550
then stop and yeah okay anybody have any

33:27.550 --> 33:31.070
questions no if we got any problems

33:31.070 --> 33:33.260
we'll we'll solve them on the fly and

33:33.260 --> 33:34.410
and that's it

33:34.410 --> 33:35.980
I'd say let's get wet but we're already

33:35.980 --> 33:36.980
way

33:36.980 --> 33:52.360
when you talk to John is a gleam in his

33:52.360 --> 33:55.580
eye and it's he wants to go down to the

33:55.580 --> 33:57.309
bottom he's gonna go to bottom

33:57.309 --> 34:00.631
he's not overconfident but he's

34:00.631 --> 34:07.980
confident he knows what he can do

34:07.980 --> 34:12.309
okay here we go

34:12.309 --> 34:13.389
good

34:13.389 --> 34:17.518
we're ready as a final precaution should

34:17.518 --> 34:19.539
something go wrong with John's surface

34:19.539 --> 34:22.440
air supply he will be carrying with him

34:22.440 --> 34:25.109
a single emergency air tank attached to

34:25.109 --> 34:26.109
his waist

34:26.109 --> 34:37.149
copy that because Marty and Craig tester

34:37.149 --> 34:39.478
cannot be there in person they will be

34:39.478 --> 34:41.710
able to monitor the diver via

34:41.710 --> 34:42.710
videoconference

34:42.710 --> 34:49.248
you guys look a lot warmer than we do

34:49.248 --> 34:52.369
beautiful care look we wouldn't have

34:52.369 --> 34:53.690
started on this journey without my

34:53.690 --> 34:57.380
brother so having him there released on

34:57.380 --> 34:58.809
the television screen of course it's

34:58.809 --> 35:02.893
important I mean that that's what this

35:02.893 --> 35:03.893
is about

35:03.893 --> 35:04.893
and I'm sure I know that he wishes he

35:04.893 --> 35:06.599
were here are you in the water right now

35:06.599 --> 35:16.109
okay

35:16.109 --> 35:21.520
okay standby I'll stop I'll stop

35:21.520 --> 35:29.000
confirmed
perfect okay when you step

35:29.000 --> 35:30.789
onto the ladder I'm gonna fire on your

35:30.789 --> 35:37.060
light okay John to guide himself down a

35:37.060 --> 35:39.989
181 foot portion of the shaft John

35:39.989 --> 35:42.339
Chapman is using the ladder installed

35:42.339 --> 35:45.220
nearly 30 years ago by Dan and Dave

35:45.220 --> 35:48.660
Blankenship although it is rusted due to

35:48.660 --> 35:51.079
decades of exposure to the frigid salt

35:51.079 --> 35:53.549
waters of the North Atlantic it should

35:53.549 --> 35:55.420
still be strong enough for today's

35:55.420 --> 36:08.739
descent right okay is the visibility

36:08.739 --> 36:17.410
less than zero John yeah I think we can

36:17.410 --> 36:20.579
kind of see it

36:20.579 --> 36:26.130
opening so that's good he's like right

36:26.130 --> 36:28.589
on schedule what's your death John

36:28.589 --> 36:47.119
alright we're gonna switch gas now
okay

36:47.119 --> 36:52.650
proceed then

36:52.650 --> 37:07.809
inside the rock

37:07.809 --> 37:12.869
you

37:12.869 --> 37:17.170
you're in the rock copy world renowned

37:17.170 --> 37:20.700
diver John Chatterton is now deep inside

37:20.700 --> 37:23.990
or halt annex he has just entered the

37:23.990 --> 37:27.019
narrow 27-inch hole and is about to make

37:27.019 --> 37:29.630
his way to what could be a man-made

37:29.630 --> 37:33.299
treasure chamber 235 feet deep

37:33.299 --> 37:37.980
underground yes he's dropping down

37:37.980 --> 37:39.880
through the anhydrate right now and you

37:39.880 --> 38:05.339
can see the rock at a depth of 204 feet

38:05.339 --> 38:07.999
beneath the surface John Chatterton has

38:07.999 --> 38:09.869
encountered the drill bar that is

38:09.869 --> 38:13.180
remained wedged inside the narrow

38:13.180 --> 38:27.739
27-inch wide shaft

38:27.739 --> 38:28.739
you should have some

38:28.739 --> 38:30.700
slack be trying to run the host past the

38:30.700 --> 38:31.700
drill bar

38:31.700 --> 38:37.440
he's got quite a bit of slack in the

38:37.440 --> 38:45.380
water right now getting past the 20 foot

38:45.380 --> 38:47.279
drill bar is proving to be more

38:47.279 --> 38:48.910
difficult than John chattered and

38:48.910 --> 38:51.730
expected if he can't move his body

38:51.730 --> 39:06.009
around it the dive is over

39:06.009 --> 39:08.410
suddenly the team's worst fears have

39:08.410 --> 39:11.349
become realized John Chatterton's

39:11.349 --> 39:13.619
breathing and communications apparatus

39:13.619 --> 39:16.690
have become caught on the drill bar if

39:16.690 --> 39:19.220
his air cable breaks John could find

39:19.220 --> 39:20.890
himself in deadly danger

39:20.890 --> 39:37.619
we did

39:37.619 --> 39:47.789
when you hear the word stuck over that a

39:47.789 --> 39:50.420
diver a hundred and two hundred feet

39:50.420 --> 39:53.819
below the surface of course it strikes a

39:53.819 --> 40:01.670
court might the drill bar have dislodged

40:01.670 --> 40:04.539
might it be in a very precarious

40:04.539 --> 40:06.769
position nothing I can do but pray

40:06.769 --> 40:24.589
why is free diver one are you able to

40:24.589 --> 40:27.170
make it past that and continue down the

40:27.170 --> 40:30.469
the opening by staying focused and

40:30.469 --> 40:33.529
maneuvering his body carefully John

40:33.529 --> 40:35.230
Chatterton has managed to move past the

40:35.230 --> 40:37.849
drill bar and continuous journey down

40:37.849 --> 40:41.499
the narrow 27-inch wide Chou fiber to if

40:41.499 --> 40:43.569
you just want to stand by right there in

40:43.569 --> 40:53.890
case John gets snagged again
Rick Marty

40:53.890 --> 40:56.489
Craig and their partners could be just

40:56.489 --> 40:58.979
minutes away from finding out if what

40:58.979 --> 41:01.760
dan Blankenship has believed for 40

41:01.760 --> 41:05.410
years is true the 10x really does

41:05.410 --> 41:10.219
contain man-made tunnels wooden posts a

41:10.219 --> 41:14.450
wooden chest human remains and quite

41:14.450 --> 41:16.559
possibly the ultimate answer to what

41:16.559 --> 41:22.569
happened on Oak Island centuries ago

41:22.569 --> 41:27.779
now you're sure you're at the bottom of

41:27.779 --> 41:31.509
that you're in the chambers what you're

41:31.509 --> 41:33.759
saying

41:33.759 --> 41:41.290
next time on the curse of Oak Island

41:41.290 --> 41:44.000
what tunnel that humans were

41:44.000 --> 41:45.499
we found it it blows the whole thing

41:45.499 --> 41:47.009
wide open picked it up it was heavy

41:47.009 --> 41:56.869
here we go we had to explore the boy so

41:56.869 --> 41:59.759
we brought in of specialists

41:59.759 --> 42:01.229
that right there I'm gonna looks

42:01.229 --> 42:04.500
metallic if you're going to color

42:04.524 --> 42:06.524
