00:32.945 --> 00:34.456
Hi, it's Marla.

00:34.749 --> 00:37.773
I changed my mind.
I can't do this right now.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.175
You're here?

00:40.995 --> 00:42.378
At the club?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.038
No. I can't meet you.

00:48.073 --> 00:50.441
I have to get back to my daughter.

00:53.827 --> 00:55.058
Mom?

00:58.645 --> 01:00.177
Mom.

01:06.101 --> 01:07.390
Mom.

01:10.027 --> 01:12.781
Mom! Where are you?

01:47.910 --> 01:49.257
You don't trust me.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.453
It's such a control thing.
Admit it. Admit it.

01:51.488 --> 01:53.598
You're reluctant to leave me in charge.

01:53.856 --> 01:56.209
Rubbish.
Then why haven't you gone yet?

01:57.299 --> 01:59.069
What?
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

01:59.104 --> 02:01.260
You haven't had a vacation
in 6 years, Cal. Come on.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.592
You are trying to miss your flight.
I am not.

02:03.627 --> 02:06.218
I am not. I am trying to find

02:06.253 --> 02:07.554
The Anderson file.
The Anderson file.

02:07.589 --> 02:09.160
I've got it, all right?

02:09.195 --> 02:10.988
I can take care of it. Come on.

02:11.023 --> 02:12.578
Stop stalling.

02:12.613 --> 02:14.515
Where are you going?
Honestly, Cal.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.117
The cab is outside waiting for
you. Grab your jacket and let's go.

02:17.152 --> 02:18.546
You deserve this.

02:18.581 --> 02:20.597
- Emily's waiting for you. Come on.
- Don't push me. Don't push me.

02:20.632 --> 02:22.747
Come on, let's go. Here.

02:23.379 --> 02:24.856
Here.
Oh, give me your cell phone.

02:24.891 --> 02:28.207
You don't need to check in while you're gone.
It's just gonna stress you out. Come on.

02:28.407 --> 02:30.141
No kicking and screaming?

02:30.762 --> 02:33.024
I have absolute faith in you.

02:33.293 --> 02:34.711
And my staff.

02:37.559 --> 02:38.954
Here I go, then.

02:40.676 --> 02:42.153
Have a good time.

03:00.707 --> 03:02.664
Are you really working?

03:02.699 --> 03:04.633
We've only been here 2 days.

03:05.113 --> 03:07.281
You really need to
learn how to relax, dad.

03:07.316 --> 03:10.953
People who can't relax die younger.
I learned that in health class.

03:10.988 --> 03:12.781
Don't worry about me, love,
will you?

03:12.816 --> 03:15.184
- What are you looking at, anyway?
- Nothing.

03:15.219 --> 03:17.117
You're spying on the office?

03:17.480 --> 03:20.973
Look, I'm my own boss.
That's a 24/7 job.

03:21.008 --> 03:24.065
Someday, when I'm a stressed-out
workaholic, I'll have you to thank.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.647
When did you become such a know-it-all?

03:25.682 --> 03:28.214
We had an agreement that
if I behave maturely,

03:28.249 --> 03:31.682
you would treat me like an adult. So,
as an adult, I'm telling you to relax

03:31.717 --> 03:33.756
- and stop it with the creepy snooping.
- Hey.

03:33.791 --> 03:36.990
If you don't,
I'll just go pick up boys by the pool.

03:37.025 --> 03:38.900
All right, deal.

03:39.509 --> 03:41.560
Oh, I'll have one of those, too, thanks.

03:41.595 --> 03:43.478
Make it a virgin.

03:45.228 --> 03:46.951
Dr. Cal Lightman?

03:48.674 --> 03:51.130
My name's Lou Nemeroff. I'm
with the American embassy.

03:51.165 --> 03:54.422
There's an urgent matter
that we need your help with.

03:59.977 --> 04:01.864
An American woman,
Marla Seeger,

04:01.899 --> 04:04.254
disappeared 2 days ago
from the Oceano hotel.

04:04.289 --> 04:06.059
It's just down the beach.

04:06.094 --> 04:09.692
She was last seen at the hotel
bar. This is local news footage.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.880
La mujer americana...
muy borracha.

04:13.548 --> 04:16.781
This is the bartender who last saw
her. He says that she was drunk,

04:16.817 --> 04:20.319
coming on to several men, and that
she eventually left with one of them.

04:20.353 --> 04:23.061
Ahora, lo tenemos
razon para creer que...

04:23.096 --> 04:25.300
The local police,
they aren't doing anything.

04:25.335 --> 04:27.690
They believe that she left voluntarily.

04:28.053 --> 04:30.951
She's a really good mom.
I just want to find her.

04:31.677 --> 04:34.256
Mom, if you're watching this,

04:34.291 --> 04:36.084
please come back.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.545
And that's her 12-year-old daughter.

04:40.162 --> 04:42.611
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

04:43.361 --> 04:44.990
What's the state department
doing about this?

04:45.025 --> 04:48.154
Their official policy is to leave it
in the hands of local authorities.

04:48.189 --> 04:49.783
Oh, so nothing.

04:49.818 --> 04:51.545
They're doing nothing.

04:51.986 --> 04:54.278
Which makes me wonder why you're here.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.775
Your boss doesn't know about this
little field trip of yours, does he?

04:57.810 --> 04:59.925
I can't ignore what's
going on in Mexico.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.127
Which is what?

05:01.161 --> 05:03.915
More than 200 americans have gone
missing in the last few years,

05:03.950 --> 05:06.276
mostly collateral damage
from the drug cartels,

05:06.311 --> 05:10.456
but unless it's some pretty blond teenager,
nobody even wants to talk about it.

05:11.007 --> 05:14.710
All I need to know is if somebody on
this video is trying to hide something.

05:14.745 --> 05:18.564
Yeah, the detective in charge of
the case and, um, the bartender.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.244
Dr. Lightman,
can you help us find Marla Seeger?

05:23.428 --> 05:24.887
- Dad.
- What?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.410
Come on.

05:29.551 --> 05:32.878
Some people at the hotel, they
said that they saw your mom crying.

05:32.913 --> 05:34.519
Why was she sad?

05:34.554 --> 05:36.007
I don't know.

05:36.611 --> 05:40.624
Everyone's saying she was a bad mother,
but she always took good care of me.

05:41.128 --> 05:42.978
Yeah, I'll bet she did.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.597
You think you can find her?

05:44.632 --> 05:47.945
Oh, absolutely. He's definitely
gonna find your mom.

05:51.265 --> 05:52.745
I don't know.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.645
I don't know, love.

05:55.460 --> 05:59.304
You ever think that
grownups are full of crap?

06:00.358 --> 06:02.315
Yeah. Lots of times.

06:02.350 --> 06:04.882
Usually it's 'cause
we've made a mistake,

06:05.175 --> 06:07.706
done something wrong,
but we don't want

06:07.741 --> 06:09.804
to talk about it, we
don't want to admit it.

06:09.839 --> 06:12.159
Which makes us hypocrites.

06:13.976 --> 06:16.483
I think you've got a secret.

06:17.058 --> 06:19.647
And you're too scared to talk about it.

06:33.640 --> 06:38.590
Mom always picks awful boyfriends,
so I signed her up for an online dating service.

06:41.789 --> 06:43.301
This is a guy you found for her?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.844
He said he traveled a lot and
I told him we were coming here.

06:45.879 --> 06:47.567
Well, what did he say?

06:48.364 --> 06:49.875
He said he'd meet me.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.811
I wasn't aware of this.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.796
J-Rod25.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.843
My mom was supposed to have
dinner with him last night.

06:57.821 --> 07:00.036
What if he did something to my mom?

07:03.493 --> 07:05.439
We rushed over here right
away. Did we hear right?

07:05.474 --> 07:07.654
3 patients have been
infected by tainted blood?

07:07.689 --> 07:09.892
The first patient died this
morning at cottage hospital,

07:09.927 --> 07:12.552
and the second is in critical
condition at St. Mary's.

07:12.587 --> 07:16.860
This is Gary Spar, the third patient to
receive a blood transfusion during surgery.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.626
It should have been a routine
operation, but he never woke up.

07:19.661 --> 07:22.849
I need you to seal off that O.R.
and gather and test everything.

07:22.884 --> 07:24.794
So 3 different patients
at 3 different hospitals?

07:24.829 --> 07:28.929
It's no longer a coincidence. We shut
down the D.C. central blood bank.

07:28.964 --> 07:32.282
Go help pat rule out any
other possible contaminants.

07:32.317 --> 07:34.775
We're in a real quandary.
We need to protect people,

07:34.810 --> 07:38.308
but if there's no blood available for
trauma cases and other emergencies,

07:38.343 --> 07:39.896
patients may die anyway.

07:39.931 --> 07:41.408
Do you have any idea
what's in the blood?

07:41.443 --> 07:45.322
Oh, worst case scenario, it's a
biological or a chemical agent.

07:45.357 --> 07:48.376
The fbI has been alerted in
case this is bioterrorism.

07:48.411 --> 07:50.449
I know.
I'm on my way to the hospital CEO,

07:50.483 --> 07:51.931
- right now.
- What can we do to help?

07:51.966 --> 07:54.626
The people who have
access to those blood units

07:54.661 --> 07:57.749
all claim no involvement or knowledge.

07:57.784 --> 07:59.929
I need to know who we can trust.

08:00.374 --> 08:01.968
Should we get Lightman back here?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.855
I can take care of this.

08:04.278 --> 08:06.011
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. What have you got?

08:06.046 --> 08:09.164
Well, the tainted blood units all came from
the overnight shift at the blood banks.

08:09.199 --> 08:10.933
There were 2 techs on duty.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.523
We're taking them down to the Lightman
group right now for questioning.

08:13.558 --> 08:15.410
Dr. Cho,
I haven't forgotten about you.

08:15.445 --> 08:17.847
As soon as I have a minute,
we'll talk.

08:18.773 --> 08:20.683
That little boy has sickle cell anemia.

08:20.718 --> 08:23.367
If he doesn't have a blood
transfusion in the next 24 hours,

08:23.402 --> 08:24.738
he could have a stroke.

08:24.773 --> 08:26.261
What about getting the
blood from outside areas?

08:26.296 --> 08:27.843
There's a real shortage.
We're working on it,

08:27.878 --> 08:30.035
but it's gonna take
time that we don't have.

08:30.070 --> 08:33.351
Oh, Jack, thank God you're
here. Do you know Dr. Foster?

08:33.385 --> 08:35.775
Gillian, this is a lovely surprise.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.150
- What are you doing here?
- The CDC contacted the Rader firm

08:39.186 --> 08:41.835
to help assist you since
Dr. Lightman isn't here.

08:41.870 --> 08:43.299
Where is Cal?

08:43.335 --> 08:44.530
He's on vacation.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.811
And hell didn't freeze over?

08:47.729 --> 08:49.811
Well, now it's a shame he's gone.

08:49.846 --> 08:51.491
I was hoping he and I
could bury the hatchet.

08:51.526 --> 08:54.004
- Is there a problem?
- Lightman and I are...

08:54.238 --> 08:55.984
friendly rivals, so to speak.

08:56.019 --> 08:57.611
It won't be a problem.

08:57.646 --> 08:58.914
Will it?

08:59.359 --> 09:01.845
No. Not at all.

09:05.359 --> 09:06.478
Oh, hey, hey.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.430
The 2 techs from the
blood bank are here.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.621
So tell me, what's the deal
with Lightman and Rader?

09:10.656 --> 09:12.766
What, they don't get along or something?

09:12.801 --> 09:15.016
Cal despises him.

09:15.051 --> 09:17.344
He thinks all he cares
about is money and publicity.

09:17.379 --> 09:19.399
Well, for once I'm
with Lightman on this.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.912
Something tells me
not to trust that guy.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.590
Hey. Hi.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.547
You're the detective in charge
of the Seeger case, right?

09:29.582 --> 09:30.801
Yes.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.836
Hey. I'm Emily Lightman.
This is Dr. Cal Lightman.

09:33.871 --> 09:35.418
He's a deception expert

09:35.453 --> 09:37.211
and he works along with the
police in the United States.

09:37.246 --> 09:38.878
In the United States, yeah.

09:38.913 --> 09:41.090
- This is Mexico.
- No, I knew that.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.438
I knew it.

09:42.473 --> 09:45.660
Um, now,
I saw some news footage,

09:45.883 --> 09:50.243
and I think that the bartender at Marla
Seeger's hotel is giving false information

09:50.723 --> 09:52.751
About her disappearance.
Dr. Lightman,

09:52.786 --> 09:54.251
there is no case here.

09:54.286 --> 09:56.196
Ok?
We spoke to several resort employees.

09:56.231 --> 09:59.278
They said she seemed unstable,
more than likely a drug user.

09:59.313 --> 10:00.461
Based on what?

10:00.496 --> 10:02.512
We found several used
needles in her hotel room.

10:02.547 --> 10:04.669
She probably found a fellow
drug user, left with him.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.906
She will be back when the drugs run out.

10:06.941 --> 10:10.703
Ok. I still think you should
have another go at the bartender.

10:11.090 --> 10:14.910
And I think that you and your daughter
should have a very lovely time here. Ok?

10:14.945 --> 10:17.371
Por favor,
lleve a este gente afuera.

10:17.406 --> 10:21.822
No, what about the guy that Tyler
that said her mom was gonna meet?

10:22.103 --> 10:24.553
- You spoke to Tyler?
- Yeah.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.557
There are many people here
who would not like the fact

10:29.592 --> 10:31.604
that you have shown interest in
this matter. Do you understand me?

10:31.639 --> 10:34.639
So I'm gonna give you
one piece of advice.

10:34.979 --> 10:36.995
Stay out of this.

10:45.256 --> 10:46.639
Mojito, por favor.

10:46.674 --> 10:48.280
And a margarita.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.909
A coke.

10:49.944 --> 10:51.760
Coke for the senorita.

10:51.936 --> 10:53.565
Enjoying your vacation, senor? Yeah.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.548
Well, no, I was until that woman turned
up missing. What's her name again?

10:56.583 --> 10:58.341
Ah... Marla Seeger.

10:58.376 --> 10:59.536
That's it, yeah.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.868
Hey, you're the guy on the tv, right?

11:01.903 --> 11:03.848
You saw her that night?

11:04.118 --> 11:05.735
What do you think happened to her?

11:06.005 --> 11:08.114
She was dancing with many different men.

11:08.149 --> 11:11.061
She was looking for a good
time. She left with one of them.

11:11.096 --> 11:13.076
They were sleeping on
the beach or getting high.

11:13.111 --> 11:15.572
What did he look like,
the guy she left with?

11:15.607 --> 11:19.111
Don't let this trouble get in your
head, senor. Everything is fine.

11:26.096 --> 11:29.037
You're an awful liar, Miguel.

11:29.675 --> 11:32.549
Now you're terrified.
What is it?

11:34.644 --> 11:37.025
- You work for the police?
- Miguel.

11:42.251 --> 11:44.970
Vete a la casa, ahora.

11:46.951 --> 11:50.784
I'm so sorry. We are closing
this bar while we restock.

11:52.718 --> 11:54.347
- Is there a problem?
- No.

11:54.382 --> 11:57.433
If you're here on vacation,
please tell us whatever we can do

11:57.468 --> 11:59.296
to make your stay more enjoyable.

11:59.331 --> 12:02.272
If, however, you're here
conducting an investigation,

12:02.307 --> 12:04.042
You're not welcome here.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.437
Yeah, Torres, it's me.
I need you down here.

12:11.472 --> 12:12.820
Wait, for what?

12:12.855 --> 12:14.870
Uh, a woman's gone missing.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.945
Yeah. I'll tell you all about
it when you get down here.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.843
Just bring something
pretty to wear, all right?

12:18.878 --> 12:20.027
Yeah.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.585
Dude, you're gonna find her.

12:21.620 --> 12:24.620
For you,
I will move heaven and earth.

12:25.851 --> 12:28.716
Hey. Lightman just called. He needs
me to fly down to Zulia right now.

12:28.751 --> 12:31.031
He's on a case? Yeah.
A woman's missing.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.601
I gotta go.

12:32.636 --> 12:34.499
Uhh. He's on vacation.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.226
Ok. Just give me one sec.

12:38.788 --> 12:40.909
So, how is it working for Cal?

12:40.944 --> 12:42.398
Been so long, I can't remember.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.175
I work with Cal. I'm an
equity partner, you know.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.917
Good for you. That means Cal's
been working on his control issues.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.745
Jack... I meant that as a compliment.

12:49.780 --> 12:53.741
Seriously, he was my mentor. I have nothing
but respect and admiration for the man.

12:53.776 --> 12:56.260
Obviously, he doesn't
feel the same about me.

12:56.295 --> 12:58.674
Cal says he taught you
just enough to be dangerous.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.678
He's the better scientist,
no doubt.

13:00.713 --> 13:04.123
But I'm not going to apologize for having
ambition and a better business sense.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.790
If we're gonna work together,
I have some ground rules.

13:06.824 --> 13:08.576
First, I'm the boss around here.

13:08.611 --> 13:11.905
Second, don't try using
me to get back at Cal.

13:11.940 --> 13:13.592
So long as you...

13:14.108 --> 13:17.635
Admit that there's just the
tiniest moment happening right now.

13:17.670 --> 13:19.205
Will you admit that?

13:19.451 --> 13:22.662
Hey, Romeo and Juliet, you want
to get this show on the road?

13:22.697 --> 13:25.216
People could be dying right now.

13:28.604 --> 13:30.642
You can leave.
Thank you for coming.

13:30.677 --> 13:34.088
Agent reynolds, could you escort him out
and bring miss bynes to a more private room?

13:34.123 --> 13:36.314
Sure.
Will you come with me, please?

13:36.525 --> 13:39.466
People hiding something never want
to draw attention to themselves.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.943
That was awesome.

13:40.978 --> 13:43.545
The old routine's a little
rusty, but she still works.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.838
- I meant what I said about the ground
rules. - And I meant what I said.

13:47.611 --> 13:50.150
Shall we go find out what
Miss Vines is hiding?

13:50.646 --> 13:52.193
Nice work.

13:56.013 --> 13:59.224
It was a regular night at the
blood bank... nothing unusual.

13:59.259 --> 14:02.916
Your boss was about to fire
you for being late too often.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.183
You knew.

14:06.571 --> 14:08.317
Was this retaliation?

14:08.352 --> 14:10.497
She's breathing faster.
Foster's getting somewhere.

14:10.532 --> 14:12.957
You have no idea how good she is.

14:12.992 --> 14:17.799
Lightman doesn't know. He has a hard time
seeing the true potential of his employees.

14:20.269 --> 14:21.851
What was that?

14:21.886 --> 14:25.417
Little flash of anger at
the infallible Cal Lightman?

14:26.046 --> 14:30.687
You run this entire lab. But I'll bet Lightman's
never showed you an ounce of appreciation.

14:31.249 --> 14:33.897
So, you and Lightman...

14:34.319 --> 14:36.475
- We had a falling-out.
- What, over a case?

14:36.510 --> 14:38.245
Water under the bridge now.

14:38.983 --> 14:42.804
You know, I never knew my own worth until
I got out from under Lightman's shadow.

14:42.839 --> 14:45.018
Someday, you'll do that same.

14:45.053 --> 14:48.054
It's been hard for me. My husband
left us. I'm alone with the kids.

14:48.089 --> 14:49.736
Voice pitch is higher.

14:49.770 --> 14:51.883
What's that look there? Shame?

14:52.882 --> 14:55.507
I just went through a divorce myself.

14:55.858 --> 14:57.698
I can barely get out of bed.

14:57.733 --> 15:00.452
I can't think straight,
I can't do my job right...

15:01.893 --> 15:03.815
People are dying.

15:04.436 --> 15:10.118
You feel guilty, but you're gonna feel worse
if you keep secrets and another person dies.

15:14.598 --> 15:17.915
On my last shift, I didn't run the
full testing protocol on the blood.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.083
So, you have to test on any
blood for different diseases.

15:21.383 --> 15:23.880
I left early.
My daughter needed me.

15:23.915 --> 15:26.633
There are so many other
safeguards. I didn't think.

15:26.668 --> 15:28.227
I just...

15:32.048 --> 15:34.520
I think we have our culprit.
No, we don't.

15:34.696 --> 15:38.165
Someone else just died after
a transfusion at Euclid Park.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.145
And this patient banked his own blood.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.983
Central blood bank isn't responsible.

15:45.454 --> 15:48.313
So, you're setting me up on a blind
date with a potential murderer?

15:48.348 --> 15:50.118
Yeah. Why? He's not your type?

15:50.153 --> 15:52.110
I'll keep an eye on you.
You'll be fine.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.840
- What are the police doing?
- Nothing.

15:56.287 --> 15:58.396
So, we're doing this on our own.
Yeah.

15:58.755 --> 16:00.506
You know, you pulled me off
a really big case back home.

16:00.541 --> 16:02.252
The CDC brought in the
Rader firm to work with us...

16:02.287 --> 16:03.928
Jack Rader?
Yeah, he's at the office

16:03.963 --> 16:05.932
Working with Foster.
Why? What's the problem?

16:06.155 --> 16:08.634
Not sure. Not sure. Get in.

16:08.950 --> 16:10.755
Want to see the sights?

16:10.790 --> 16:12.149
Yeah.

16:14.176 --> 16:17.071
Who you with? You, uh,
with the hotel?

16:17.739 --> 16:19.074
Police?

16:20.973 --> 16:22.555
Drug cartel?

16:26.809 --> 16:28.121
Who's that guy?

16:28.156 --> 16:30.981
He's with the police or drug cartel.

16:36.981 --> 16:38.375
Dont go anywhere.

16:48.698 --> 16:50.034
Miguel?

16:55.413 --> 16:57.042
How did you find me here?

16:57.077 --> 16:58.776
I bribed a waitress at the hotel.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.327
You picked the wrong
part of town to visit.

17:02.362 --> 17:04.472
So, you think I should
call the cops, then?

17:04.507 --> 17:05.819
Eh?

17:05.854 --> 17:08.948
Oh, are you scared of being seen
with me by the police, are you?

17:09.616 --> 17:11.421
Turistas estupidos.

17:11.455 --> 17:12.955
Eso fue un "s?"

17:13.390 --> 17:16.752
Dinos la verdad sobre
Marla Seeger, y nos iremos.

17:19.869 --> 17:23.198
The police told us to say the american
lady was looking for a good time,

17:23.233 --> 17:25.166
that it was her own fault. Why?

17:25.472 --> 17:27.441
Zulia depends on tourists.

17:27.476 --> 17:29.960
Something bad happens, you
all disappear, the town dies.

17:29.995 --> 17:33.862
After the lady from Miami disappeared,
we were told not to talk to anyone about...

17:35.843 --> 17:37.648
What lady from Miami?

17:41.023 --> 17:43.484
Do you want me to call the cops, or...

17:44.562 --> 17:46.507
She came here 4 months ago.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.382
She was found dead.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.808
The police kept it out of the news.

17:50.843 --> 17:53.783
We should get out of here. I'm gonna
tell the cabby that we're ready to go.

17:53.818 --> 17:55.060
Ok.

18:02.185 --> 18:03.422
Hey,

18:03.456 --> 18:05.044
Did you, uh,

18:05.079 --> 18:08.290
did you really see
Marla Seeger at the bar?

18:08.325 --> 18:10.376
I saw her with one man.

18:10.411 --> 18:12.814
I'm not sure if she
left with him or not.

18:12.849 --> 18:14.478
Was it this guy?

18:17.290 --> 18:20.033
That's him. I'm positive.

18:20.068 --> 18:21.380
Now go.

18:21.415 --> 18:22.986
Cab's gone.

18:23.372 --> 18:24.533
What?

18:24.568 --> 18:26.982
The cab... it's gone.

18:28.786 --> 18:30.697
Uh, here, hold that.

18:31.271 --> 18:32.660
Um...

18:32.694 --> 18:35.618
I'll give $200

18:35.970 --> 18:39.732
To the person that gives
us a ride back to our hotel.

18:47.196 --> 18:48.848
Now, where's your car?

18:49.809 --> 18:51.544
Quiso decir quinientos...

18:51.579 --> 18:54.157
Dos ahora,
tres despues de que llegamos.

18:57.473 --> 18:59.817
We're lucky they didn't kill us
and dump our bodies in a ditch.

18:59.852 --> 19:01.300
That wasn't luck.

19:01.334 --> 19:04.376
The driver was happy to make
some honest money for a change.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.993
You read that?

19:06.028 --> 19:08.735
Yeah.
Speaking of big and flashy...

19:09.098 --> 19:11.583
I need you to find out
what Rader's up to.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.837
You want me to spy for you?

19:12.872 --> 19:15.075
No, I don't want you to spy for me.

19:15.110 --> 19:18.227
I just want you to poke about
a bit. I'll do my own spying.

19:18.262 --> 19:21.173
All right. Well, it's just my opinion,
but I think that might be a little overkill.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.774
Your opinion? I don't need your
opinion. I didn't ask for it.

19:23.809 --> 19:25.497
Just do it.
All right? All right.

19:35.804 --> 19:37.046
Wait here.

19:41.159 --> 19:43.582
Oi! Oi! That's my daughter!

19:43.762 --> 19:45.368
Hey, she started...
That's my daughter.

19:45.403 --> 19:47.302
She started talking to me.
You're having a conversation

19:47.337 --> 19:49.036
with my teenage daughter!

19:49.071 --> 19:50.899
She started talking to me.

19:51.614 --> 19:52.774
What?

19:52.809 --> 19:54.626
All right. Ok. I'm leaving.

19:55.481 --> 19:58.364
Dad, that was the guy
that Tyler's been emailing.

19:58.399 --> 20:01.211
I know it was. And you shouldn't have
been talking to him, Emily. Bloody hell.

20:01.246 --> 20:03.787
- You never said I shouldn't talk to
him. - Well, what am I supposed to do?

20:03.821 --> 20:06.455
Tell you not to do every
potentially life-threatening thing?

20:06.490 --> 20:08.327
No.
I figured if I kept him talking...

20:08.362 --> 20:09.874
This is the last thing I need, Emily.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.792
You know, I've got a con
man back in my office!

20:12.827 --> 20:16.449
And I've got you behaving
like Nancy bloody Drew!

20:16.906 --> 20:19.417
I was just...
I was just trying to help.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.034
Where are you going?

20:27.429 --> 20:28.847
Don't.

20:56.899 --> 20:58.064
Hi.

20:58.376 --> 21:00.031
I'm Lola.

21:00.474 --> 21:02.099
Jerry Conway.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.380
Please.

21:06.368 --> 21:08.782
You're a very confident woman, Lola.

21:08.817 --> 21:11.099
I mean that in the most flattering way.

21:11.134 --> 21:13.763
Well. Then color me flattered.

21:15.661 --> 21:17.970
So, how long you been a masseuse?

21:18.649 --> 21:21.132
Uh, just a couple of years.

21:21.199 --> 21:22.632
Really?

21:32.559 --> 21:35.524
No, seriously. The last guy I
dated was a complete nut job.

21:35.559 --> 21:37.446
Oh, I've been there.
Oh. Really?

21:37.481 --> 21:39.145
Ok. Well...

21:39.872 --> 21:42.216
You tell me about your last
psycho, I'll tell you about mine.

21:42.251 --> 21:44.712
Least interesting
story does a body shot.

21:44.747 --> 21:46.188
You're on.

21:47.466 --> 21:50.700
I met this weird chick,
Marla, a couple nights ago.

21:51.298 --> 21:55.298
Yes. The hospitals trade blood with each
other, but euclid park's not at fault.

21:55.532 --> 21:58.883
I've been here 10 years. Yager's been
here 9. We've never had a problem.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.286
We're not the source
of the tainted blood.

22:01.848 --> 22:03.629
How can you be sure?

22:04.321 --> 22:09.321
I mean, I can't imagine how.
There's been no change in procedure.

22:09.742 --> 22:12.016
There's been no change in procedure.

22:21.912 --> 22:23.131
Lightman?

22:32.132 --> 22:33.778
Ok. All right.

22:42.579 --> 22:46.025
Dr. Foster, here's the
blue file that you needed.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.607
Sorry for the delay.

22:47.642 --> 22:49.458
- The blue file?
- Yeah.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.685
Thank you.

22:53.571 --> 22:55.864
Do you know what this is,
Mr. Dunst?

22:56.020 --> 22:58.528
This is a file all about you...

22:58.563 --> 23:02.243
Background check, interviews
with coworkers, family, friends.

23:02.454 --> 23:07.004
My team compiled it. You know,
we can scour this to discover what you're hiding,

23:07.727 --> 23:10.235
but why don't you save us the time?

23:19.997 --> 23:23.043
Tomkins, the new driver in the lab,
is a felon.

23:24.075 --> 23:26.497
He told Yager he left the
conviction off his job application.

23:26.532 --> 23:28.730
And I should have reported it, but...

23:29.301 --> 23:31.199
maybe you should talk to him.

23:46.532 --> 23:47.835
Lola...

23:47.870 --> 23:49.897
Hey. All right.

23:50.331 --> 23:53.235
He's married, goes online to meet
women while he's on business trips.

23:53.269 --> 23:56.322
He's a schmuck, but he had nothing
to do with Marla's disappearance.

23:56.357 --> 23:57.752
Are you sure? Positive.

23:57.787 --> 23:59.569
They met.
She left after like a minute.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.665
Uh, he says that she was crying and
talking to some couple in the lobby.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.197
He seems truthful.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.147
I can't believe you told him I like
role-playing and dirty limericks,

24:08.182 --> 24:09.360
you...

24:09.394 --> 24:11.783
don't knock it till you've tried it.

24:13.682 --> 24:15.006
Hang on.

24:16.728 --> 24:18.486
You following me?

24:20.549 --> 24:23.185
You have a lovely friend...

24:23.631 --> 24:25.260
and daughter.

24:25.295 --> 24:28.342
Is that a threat? 'Cause you really
shouldn't be confusing on that.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.838
Not at all, Dr. Lightman.

24:37.377 --> 24:38.537
Hey.

24:38.572 --> 24:42.088
You sent someone to follow me,
and they threatened my daughter.

24:42.334 --> 24:44.467
I didn't hire him.
Some people here do.

24:44.502 --> 24:46.998
Yeah, well,
so do the drug cartels.

24:47.033 --> 24:49.307
I warned you not to get involved.

24:49.693 --> 24:52.430
All right. 4 months ago,
another woman went missing,

24:52.465 --> 24:55.705
Just like Marla Seeger,
but this one turned up dead.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.897
Ok, listen.
I insist that you stop interfering. Ok?

25:00.047 --> 25:03.518
All right, the night Marla Seeger disappeared,
she met a man named jerry conway.

25:03.553 --> 25:06.541
Then she met a couple outside
the bar. Did you know that?

25:06.576 --> 25:08.497
There is no case here.

25:08.532 --> 25:12.520
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a young
woman who killed her own mother. Ok?

25:12.555 --> 25:14.770
Hey.
Su madre la estaba abusando.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.532
No tene­a otra opcion. Usted
lo haba­a hecho lo mismo.

25:17.899 --> 25:19.563
Por favor, quieto.

25:19.868 --> 25:22.106
Quieto. Ok?

25:23.184 --> 25:26.964
I think you should talk to this boy.
He's using his anger to hide something.

25:26.999 --> 25:29.910
She's protecting him,
so just talk to the boy.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.257
All right?

25:33.777 --> 25:37.003
Lleala a la segunda sala,
por favor. Y tu?

25:37.038 --> 25:39.710
Te sientas,
por favor. Sientate.

25:40.589 --> 25:42.921
How many of your people are
involved in this cover-Up?

25:42.956 --> 25:44.665
There is no cover-up.
Yeah, there is.

25:44.700 --> 25:48.393
You may not be a part of it, but
you know one exists, don't you?

25:49.999 --> 25:52.190
Ok. Ok.

25:52.741 --> 25:56.565
The couple that met Marla Seeger
say that she seemed unstable.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.448
You talked to them?

25:58.483 --> 26:00.565
Yes. Well, who are they?

26:01.120 --> 26:04.064
Dan and Stacy Felder.
But it's a dead end.

26:04.319 --> 26:06.382
You know, there is a case here.

26:06.417 --> 26:08.972
Actually, there's 2. But you
already knew that, didn't you?

26:12.136 --> 26:14.421
You're lucky you survived this accident.

26:14.456 --> 26:17.643
Why did you fail to mention your
criminal history on your application?

26:17.678 --> 26:21.980
I was 19 when I stole that car. If I
say I'm a felon, who's gonna hire me?

26:22.355 --> 26:24.418
They should have done
a background check.

26:24.453 --> 26:27.061
You've been in health care for a while.

26:27.095 --> 26:28.543
Do you enjoy it?

26:28.578 --> 26:30.494
It's very rewarding.

26:34.332 --> 26:35.703
I missed my calling.

26:35.738 --> 26:37.226
I should have been a paramedic.

26:37.261 --> 26:39.195
I mean, the action,
the glory...

26:39.230 --> 26:40.543
I mean, this...

26:41.691 --> 26:43.437
That's real life-and-death stuff.

26:43.472 --> 26:45.183
It's not too late. Heh.

26:45.218 --> 26:48.927
Yeah. I'm too old. I don't know
how we get to where we're going.

26:48.962 --> 26:50.895
Are we even aware of our choices?

26:51.289 --> 26:52.637
What, are they just chatting?

26:52.672 --> 26:54.453
We're just getting a baseline right now.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.773
You know,
let me ask you something.

26:57.441 --> 27:00.695
Was your "aha" moment
when you stole that car?

27:01.531 --> 27:03.934
I don't understand the question.

27:03.969 --> 27:07.519
You stole that car and got into an
accident with a 23-year-old kid.

27:07.871 --> 27:11.504
The police found you
cradling his mangled body.

27:11.539 --> 27:13.836
I mean, did you get into health
care because you realized

27:13.871 --> 27:16.761
You could be around blood and
guts and death all the time?

27:16.918 --> 27:20.668
That you wouldn't have to cause an
accident to get sexually stimulated?

27:21.898 --> 27:24.711
Uh-oh. Sicko alert.

27:26.691 --> 27:28.730
Pupils dilated. He's aroused.

27:28.765 --> 27:30.805
From talking about blood and guts?

27:30.840 --> 27:32.621
Yeah. They've sussed that out.

27:32.656 --> 27:36.242
What did you put in the
blood at Euclid Park hospital?

27:36.687 --> 27:38.510
- Nothing.
- You want people to suffer

27:38.544 --> 27:39.805
and die at your hand.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.312
I swear I had nothing to
do with the tainted blood.

27:42.347 --> 27:44.738
I never did anything at Euclid Park.

27:50.234 --> 27:52.308
Speech pattern's back to baseline.

27:52.343 --> 27:54.418
He's probably telling the truth.

27:54.699 --> 27:56.803
So, we're back to square one,

27:56.837 --> 27:58.308
again.

28:01.754 --> 28:03.090
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

28:03.125 --> 28:06.207
People are dying, and I can't stop thinking
about that little boy with sickle cell,

28:06.242 --> 28:08.332
and I have nothing for the CDC.
Gillian...

28:08.367 --> 28:10.172
You know, if Cal were here, he
would have solved this by now.

28:10.207 --> 28:12.305
I should have just made him come back.
Hey.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.922
We can do this. Ok?

28:13.957 --> 28:15.996
Excuse me.
You can't come in here. Jack.

28:16.969 --> 28:18.795
Mckenzie!
How did you get in here?

28:18.830 --> 28:22.012
I'm a reporter who talked her
way into attica once, remember?

28:22.047 --> 28:25.459
Scheduled surgeries are being canceled
all over D.C. with no explanation.

28:25.494 --> 28:27.461
Something's going on at the CDC.

28:27.496 --> 28:30.428
And when a little bird told me you were
partnering with the Lightman group,

28:30.463 --> 28:32.038
my reporter antenna went off.

28:32.072 --> 28:33.895
Heh heh. Mckenzie, darling,

28:33.930 --> 28:36.560
you have uncanny timing.
Let me fill you in.

28:36.885 --> 28:39.128
Can we do it on camera?
Heh heh.

29:04.477 --> 29:07.760
Oh, yeah. Thank you very much.
I'll tell him. All right. Thanks.

29:07.946 --> 29:12.245
So, a woman named Ramona Posner came
here alone from Miami about 4 months ago.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.420
10 days after she disappeared, she
was found dead in an alley downtown.

29:15.455 --> 29:18.197
State department and local
police ruled it an accident.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.295
Well, a cynic might call it a pattern.

29:21.330 --> 29:23.128
Yeah. Oh, by the way,

29:23.163 --> 29:25.287
Rader seems to be making quite
an impression at the office.

29:25.322 --> 29:27.197
Is he, now? Mm-Hmm.
According to Loker,

29:27.232 --> 29:29.062
Foster seems a bit gaga over him.

29:29.097 --> 29:30.572
Lovely.

29:30.607 --> 29:31.849
Oh, my God. What?

29:31.884 --> 29:33.490
Is that jealousy? No.

29:37.211 --> 29:38.922
Where are you going?

29:40.188 --> 29:44.728
I left my hat out by the pool. Don't
worry, I won't do anything childish.

29:47.601 --> 29:50.707
Why don't you take your extraordinary
powers of observation down to the pool

29:50.742 --> 29:52.816
and use them to keep an eye on Emily?

29:58.406 --> 29:59.941
You're jealous.

30:03.187 --> 30:04.957
Marla came up to us in the lobby.

30:04.992 --> 30:07.687
She said, "I hope you experience
the great joy I have,"

30:07.722 --> 30:09.668
and then she left.
It was bizarre.

30:09.703 --> 30:12.082
You work with the police, right?

30:12.117 --> 30:13.898
I mean,
didn't they tell you this already?

30:13.933 --> 30:16.629
Yeah, but I wanted to
hear this from you two.

30:16.664 --> 30:20.760
Mrs Felder, do you have any idea why
she would approach you like that?

30:21.539 --> 30:22.816
No.

30:24.094 --> 30:25.453
Not true.

30:25.769 --> 30:27.561
We're gonna be late for the airport.

30:27.596 --> 30:28.828
Here.

30:29.074 --> 30:30.668
No, I'll hold that.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.613
No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

30:35.027 --> 30:37.728
You know, you're never gonna
get that through customs.

30:37.763 --> 30:39.095
Why not?
Because I'm gonna call them.

30:39.162 --> 30:41.695
I'm gonna tell them you
got a suspicious package.

30:41.730 --> 30:44.941
That's the kind of pain in the ass
I can be if I don't get the truth.

30:48.656 --> 30:51.305
Look, it was just a hunch.

30:51.562 --> 30:55.363
There's a fertility treatment center here
that matches egg donors with couples.

30:55.398 --> 30:59.043
We're from Canada and it's
illegal to purchase eggs there.

30:59.078 --> 31:03.765
The donors stay anonymous, but they
can choose who they want to donate to.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.722
These are our frozen embryos.

31:05.757 --> 31:08.172
So you thought that Marla
Seeger was your egg donor.

31:08.207 --> 31:10.568
Yeah, for a moment. But then we
realized that it couldn't be her.

31:10.603 --> 31:14.103
She was nothing like the person
the broker described to us.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.696
Hey.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.500
Did you find my mom?

31:26.535 --> 31:27.895
No, love.

31:27.962 --> 31:29.242
Not yet.

31:32.586 --> 31:33.718
Well, that's lovely.

31:33.752 --> 31:36.454
Welcome to the age when they need you
but think they're smarter than you.

31:36.489 --> 31:38.844
Well, she always was.

31:40.368 --> 31:42.923
All right,
I've got one for you.

31:42.958 --> 31:47.024
Marla Seeger was a
waitress in a diner, right?

31:47.059 --> 31:48.758
And, uh...

31:49.227 --> 31:53.153
Ramona posner was a teacher's aide.

31:53.188 --> 31:57.494
How do two women like that
afford fabulous trips to Zulia?

31:57.529 --> 31:58.895
How?

31:58.930 --> 32:00.204
Well...

32:01.048 --> 32:02.828
Marla Seeger...

32:02.970 --> 32:04.728
came here as an egg donor.

32:04.763 --> 32:07.071
She was giving herself
hormone injections.

32:07.106 --> 32:09.064
Right.
And the needles that the cops found.

32:09.099 --> 32:11.232
Hence the mood swings.

32:14.361 --> 32:16.329
- Hi, can I help you?
- Cal Lightman?

32:16.394 --> 32:17.962
Yeah, he's here.

32:18.486 --> 32:20.262
Just the man I wanted to see.

32:20.329 --> 32:23.103
You need to call in some of
those embassy resources.

32:23.138 --> 32:27.828
Can't. Someone from the police department
called my boss. I've been reassigned.

32:30.439 --> 32:32.103
And threatened.

32:36.157 --> 32:39.646
Our egg donors have high IQs,
are from stable backgrounds.

32:39.681 --> 32:42.048
They don't have drug, alcohol,
or mental health problems,

32:42.083 --> 32:43.900
and many of them are star athletes.

32:43.935 --> 32:46.133
How specific can we be
in how the donors look?

32:46.168 --> 32:49.150
I have a couple here, they're
seeking someone at least 5'9",

32:49.185 --> 32:51.666
blond, blue-eyed, athletic,
and an Ivy league school.

32:51.701 --> 32:54.464
We found a match yesterday.
It's only 50,000

32:54.499 --> 32:56.503
in the states,
it would be double that.

32:56.538 --> 32:58.156
We're in here.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.723
How do you harvest the eggs, then?

33:01.203 --> 33:04.501
Our reproductive endocrinologist,
Dr. Alvarez,

33:04.844 --> 33:07.036
he's responsible for everything.

33:07.071 --> 33:08.589
Right.

33:08.623 --> 33:09.989
How much do you pay the donors?

33:10.024 --> 33:13.089
The fee is generous. Plus
they get a free trip to Zulia.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.116
But no one does it for the money.

33:15.151 --> 33:18.268
They just want to help the
right couples have a child.

33:18.303 --> 33:19.612
That's wonderful.

33:19.647 --> 33:20.866
That's wonderful.
Yeah, it's great.

33:20.901 --> 33:25.149
We actually are looking for a donor
with blue eyes and light-brown hair.

33:25.184 --> 33:27.106
And 5'6".

33:32.028 --> 33:34.001
I think I can arrange that.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.575
Thought you were gonna say that.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.493
Oh, Dr. Alvarez,
these are the garrs.

33:39.528 --> 33:41.321
Pleased to meet you.

33:41.708 --> 33:43.887
May I have a minute with you, please?

33:43.922 --> 33:45.534
Can it wait?

33:46.700 --> 33:48.835
Oh, no, no.
We've gotta shove off anyway.

33:48.870 --> 33:50.579
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- We've got to think about it.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.524
Yes. I mean,
it's a big decision.

33:52.559 --> 33:53.749
Yeah.

33:53.783 --> 33:56.293
I've got a question for you,
Dr. Alvarez.

33:56.328 --> 33:58.895
Um, we've been told that
my wife's infertility

33:58.930 --> 34:03.235
Is due to an estrogen imbalance
caused by the coriolis effect.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.879
Is that possible?

34:04.914 --> 34:07.059
That could very well be true.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.966
Did you see wynn when I described
Marla? Flared nostrils, quick breath?

34:10.001 --> 34:11.043
Yeah, he's in this.

34:11.078 --> 34:13.023
There's no way all those donors
fit the criteria he described.

34:13.058 --> 34:15.109
Oh, wait.
See, they don't have to.

34:15.355 --> 34:18.425
They find donors like Marla Seeger
who are desperate for money.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.004
They insist the donors remain anonymous.

34:21.039 --> 34:22.935
Wynn can give the buyers
any description he wants.

34:23.001 --> 34:25.340
- It's a con.
- Yeah, absolutely it's a con.

34:27.556 --> 34:30.510
Isn't the coriolis effect something
about the earth's rotation?

34:30.545 --> 34:32.880
- Yeah, exactly.
- Alvarez agreed with your theory.

34:32.915 --> 34:35.047
Yeah. That's because
Alvarez is not a doctor.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.501
He's a fake.

34:37.943 --> 34:41.101
I'm in charge of blood orders here,
and Yager coordinates trades.

34:41.137 --> 34:42.550
For the other hospitals in DC.

34:42.585 --> 34:46.534
So why did I have to
reinterview these two guys?

34:47.225 --> 34:49.710
Because we've got nothing else.

34:49.745 --> 34:51.101
Well...

34:51.444 --> 34:53.659
he's exhibiting extreme control.

34:53.694 --> 34:55.347
I guess he could still
be hiding something.

34:55.382 --> 34:58.405
No, voice pitch is steady.
Dunst isn't lying.

34:58.440 --> 35:02.366
But why does Yager keep looking
behind him? And why is he anxious?

35:02.887 --> 35:04.601
What'd I miss?

35:04.973 --> 35:06.333
What happened to the reporter?

35:06.368 --> 35:07.692
I took care of her.

35:07.727 --> 35:09.907
That could mean so many things.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.668
So the story won't be on the news?

35:12.703 --> 35:14.841
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

35:14.876 --> 35:19.763
What, did Cal brainwash you into thinking I'm
some kind of media whore without scruples?

35:19.798 --> 35:23.533
Come on, guys, tell me you got something,
'cause the tox screen's all negative so far.

35:23.568 --> 35:26.601
And the CDC is getting all
kind of calls from reporters.

35:26.636 --> 35:29.741
I can charm one reporter, I can't
control the entire fourth estate.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.835
Uh, we had the 5-car
pile-up on the beltway...

35:34.065 --> 35:35.530
Wait.

35:36.186 --> 35:37.701
Something's different.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.632
Oh, I had to change the battery,

35:39.667 --> 35:41.061
so we took a little break.

35:41.096 --> 35:45.116
But they're both more relaxed now,
and Yager's not looking behind him.

35:46.967 --> 35:48.995
Go back to before the break.

35:52.956 --> 35:54.866
He was looking at that.

35:57.608 --> 35:59.518
They got rid of it.

35:59.553 --> 36:01.827
Why didn't they want us to see it?

36:12.233 --> 36:14.659
Dr. Foster.
What can we do for you?

36:14.694 --> 36:17.035
We need to take a look around.

36:17.495 --> 36:19.501
How often do you give blood?

36:19.536 --> 36:22.793
Every 6 weeks or so. I have a rare
blood type. What are you looking for?

36:22.828 --> 36:24.785
- Found it.
- That's sensitive equipment.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.101
What's it for?

36:26.136 --> 36:28.118
Processing patient fluid samples.

36:28.153 --> 36:30.099
Could you be any more vague?

36:32.161 --> 36:34.822
It's positive for narcotics.

36:34.857 --> 36:37.025
So you've been running
a drug lab down here.

36:43.622 --> 36:44.970
Hola.

36:45.005 --> 36:47.044
Hola. ¿que tal? Hey.

36:47.478 --> 36:49.601
Where's Marla Seeger?

36:50.267 --> 36:52.851
- I don't know who that is.
- Not true.

36:53.155 --> 36:55.101
You're the couple from
the office today, no?

36:55.136 --> 36:58.195
Your partner wynn sold you out,
made a deal with the police.

36:58.230 --> 37:00.515
He said the scam was your idea.

37:01.042 --> 37:03.281
He never said that.

37:03.316 --> 37:05.835
Dr. Alvarez is responsible
for everything.

37:08.648 --> 37:10.971
- That's a lie. - No, I can
assure you it's perfectly true.

37:11.006 --> 37:12.998
What happened to her?

37:15.037 --> 37:17.580
She was one of our egg donors.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.428
She wasn't doing well on
the hormone treatments.

37:20.463 --> 37:24.400
She wanted to get the procedure over with.
But then she called to change her mind.

37:24.435 --> 37:26.768
Wynn brought her in anyway.
This is all his doing.

37:26.803 --> 37:28.549
What happened to Marla?

37:30.135 --> 37:33.299
I started the egg extraction,
but there were complications

37:33.334 --> 37:35.311
and I punctured something.

37:35.510 --> 37:37.490
She started to bleed.

37:37.959 --> 37:39.447
So where is she?

37:41.123 --> 37:43.291
Wynn has an apartment.

37:43.326 --> 37:44.932
She's dying.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.811
One more day,
we would have lost her.

37:51.846 --> 37:53.088
Yeah.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.674
Listen, how did you know that
I wasn't part of the coverup?

37:56.920 --> 38:01.920
When I accused you, you showed
genuine anger, not guilt.

38:04.406 --> 38:08.215
Listen, about that man you
sent to threaten my daughter.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.353
That wasn't me,
that was my boss.

38:13.646 --> 38:16.142
You sure this man was
part of the cartels?

38:16.177 --> 38:19.130
If I was you, I'd keep him
away from the evidence locker.

38:20.970 --> 38:23.739
I'll keep an eye on my boss, too.

38:28.505 --> 38:31.904
Rader and Foster busted a drug lab.
He's saying she's brilliant and has...

38:31.939 --> 38:34.119
All right,
keep it to yourself, huh?

38:34.353 --> 38:36.087
Uh, Lou from the embassy
asked me to stick around...

38:36.122 --> 38:38.185
Lou from the embassy? That's Lou
from the embassy. That's nice.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.470
Yeah, he asked me to stick
around for a couple extra days.

38:40.505 --> 38:41.794
So I said yeah.
Is that all right?

38:41.829 --> 38:44.707
And here I was thinking
we were happily married.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.134
The two techs were making designer
fentanyl in the hospital lab.

38:48.169 --> 38:50.443
They were using the blood
as a means of transport.

38:50.478 --> 38:53.244
Yeah. Liquid fentanyl was
injected into the blood bags,

38:53.279 --> 38:56.891
which would then be delivered to all the
heroin processing centers in the city.

38:56.926 --> 38:58.731
A lab within a lab.

38:58.766 --> 39:00.348
Pretty ingenious. Problem was,

39:00.383 --> 39:02.657
the new guy tomkins picked
up the wrong bags one day.

39:02.692 --> 39:05.894
And the fentanyl never triggered
any alarms in the patient tox screen

39:05.929 --> 39:09.258
because it's a common
anesthetic used for surgery.

39:09.293 --> 39:10.898
Sorry I'm late.

39:11.332 --> 39:13.006
They filled you in? Well,

39:13.041 --> 39:15.445
I guess we'll reopen
the central blood bank

39:15.480 --> 39:19.066
and track down all the units
that left Euclid Park hospital.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.023
Thanks to you.

39:24.340 --> 39:28.338
By the way, you should both know that I taped
an interview with McKenzie Dodd about the case.

39:28.373 --> 39:30.975
Should be airing in about an hour.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.539
How could you do that?

39:34.809 --> 39:37.188
The CDC hasn't had the press conference.

39:37.223 --> 39:38.922
Oh, I forgot.

39:38.957 --> 39:40.153
You love the spotlight.

39:40.188 --> 39:42.426
I promised an exlcusive to buy us time.

39:42.461 --> 39:44.937
This was all about getting back at
Cal and the Lightman group, wasn't it?

39:44.972 --> 39:46.144
Gillian...

39:47.040 --> 39:49.542
You know me too well.

39:52.252 --> 39:53.607
It was fun.

39:53.673 --> 39:55.053
Bye, Jack.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.213
Here's my card.

40:03.045 --> 40:05.717
In case you plan on
making a life change.

40:09.957 --> 40:11.445
Thanks, man.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.914
Well, it's been a very tense time,
but the threat has been eliminated.

40:14.949 --> 40:18.767
Dr. Cho credits you with helping a
little boy with sickle cell anemia.

40:19.599 --> 40:21.357
I knew he was slick, but, man...

40:21.392 --> 40:23.906
You were the first person that
the CDC turned to for help.

40:23.941 --> 40:26.963
Could I just say that I owe a debt
of gratitude to Dr. Gillian Foster,

40:26.998 --> 40:29.776
who really cracked this case.
This potential health disaster

40:29.811 --> 40:31.998
wouldn't have been averted without her.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.434
Mommy!

40:59.768 --> 41:04.438
So you're saying that you can just treat
me like a child whenever you want to.

41:04.473 --> 41:07.965
No, I'm not.
I'm saying that on occasion,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.960
it's my right as a parent to be
suspicious and overprotective.

41:11.995 --> 41:14.538
Ok. Then on occasion,
I reserve the right

41:14.573 --> 41:17.796
to throw tantrums and
spend all your money.

41:18.897 --> 41:20.104
Deal.

41:21.464 --> 41:25.291
Now, if you're done forcing me to work,
can I have my holiday back, please?

41:27.911 --> 41:31.440
How do you learn to live longer?

41:31.475 --> 41:34.538
Well, there's meditation and yoga,

41:34.573 --> 41:37.579
but for you,
I'd definitely say do both.

41:37.614 --> 41:40.626
Yoga's that thing you do in a lounge
chair with a mai-tai in your hand, right?

41:40.661 --> 41:42.606
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.839
Hey! Hey.

41:50.874 --> 41:53.300
"Don't hate me too much because
I'm filled with admiration."

41:53.335 --> 41:54.882
Give it to me.

41:55.363 --> 41:57.273
So who sent the flowers, then?

41:57.308 --> 41:58.937
'Cause you know I'm the jealous type.

41:58.972 --> 42:00.226
Welcome home, Cal.

42:00.261 --> 42:02.399
Rumor has it you never even
left town, but that can't be true

42:02.434 --> 42:04.117
because you look like a different man.

42:04.152 --> 42:05.745
I feel like a different man.

42:05.780 --> 42:07.667
You know,
a vacation's a wonderful thing.

42:07.702 --> 42:09.640
6 days of nothing.

42:09.675 --> 42:11.699
Well, I heard you were
working on a case.

42:11.734 --> 42:13.761
Well, it barely qualifies as a case.

42:14.335 --> 42:16.292
I feel so relaxed that...

42:16.661 --> 42:19.281
I don't even care that Rader was here.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.011
Then Torres told you.

42:22.046 --> 42:23.593
Well...

42:24.660 --> 42:27.730
So, uh,
he sent you the flowers, then?

42:28.292 --> 42:29.429
Yep.

42:30.747 --> 42:33.266
Have you checked them for aphids?

42:34.743 --> 42:36.465
No, no, I don't care.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.880
But did he see any of my research?

42:38.915 --> 42:41.141
I kept him out of your library.

42:41.176 --> 42:43.075
Oh. And is everyone still here?

42:43.110 --> 42:44.364
He didn't poach anyone.

42:44.399 --> 42:47.212
And did he break into
the office supply closet?

42:47.247 --> 42:49.532
He definitely didn't do
that. Except one thing...

42:49.567 --> 42:52.206
the sprinkler system was
acting up a little bit.

42:52.825 --> 42:54.440
That's odd.

42:55.450 --> 42:58.321
What exactly happened
between you and Rader?

42:58.696 --> 43:00.206
Oh, I'd tell you,

43:00.273 --> 43:02.434
but you'd think I was lying.

43:03.958 --> 43:05.774
Loker. My card.

43:05.809 --> 43:08.709
Just in case you're thinking
of making a life change.
