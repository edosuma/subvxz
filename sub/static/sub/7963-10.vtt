00:16.786 --> 00:19.671
Hey, Mike, I heard from
Rosa you guys broke up,

00:19.756 --> 00:21.506
and I know we haven't hung out in a bit.

00:21.591 --> 00:24.092
Just wanted you to know
I... I got your back, bud.

00:24.127 --> 00:25.927
Oh, yeah, thanks, man, appreciate it.

00:25.962 --> 00:28.046
Yeah, hey, you know, I know it's cheesy,

00:28.131 --> 00:31.466
but I brought you Josh's
patented cheer-up kit.

00:31.551 --> 00:34.102
Mm-hmm, sweet, could you, uh,

00:34.137 --> 00:36.137
bring it down and throw
it in the hot air balloon?

00:36.189 --> 00:37.438
Hot air balloon?

00:37.474 --> 00:38.640
- Mike!
- Mike!

00:40.477 --> 00:42.143
Thank you all so much for coming!

00:42.195 --> 00:44.445
Now that I am single,
I have decided to embark

00:44.481 --> 00:45.813
on a journey most bold:

00:45.899 --> 00:47.315
to have sex with every
woman in the world!

00:47.400 --> 00:48.650
Mike!

00:48.735 --> 00:50.151
Do you really think you can romance

00:50.236 --> 00:52.070
the legendary mountain women of Burma?

00:52.155 --> 00:54.288
I shall be "mountain"
all the women of Burma.

00:54.324 --> 00:56.124
Huzzah!

00:56.159 --> 00:58.076
Is it true you plan to visit
the queen in Buckingham Palace?

00:58.161 --> 00:59.911
I'll be bucking her ham palace.

00:59.996 --> 01:02.163
- Huzzah!
- The man's a hero!

01:02.248 --> 01:03.164
What a swell guy.

01:03.249 --> 01:04.549
Mike, I got... I got a question.

01:04.634 --> 01:06.884
Aren't you at all upset about Rosa?

01:06.970 --> 01:08.503
I mean, it seemed like
you were pretty into her.

01:08.588 --> 01:10.254
Look, Josh, Rosa's cool,

01:10.340 --> 01:12.256
but man just isn't wired for monogamy.

01:12.342 --> 01:14.175
I mean, do you think
cavemen were in long-term,

01:14.227 --> 01:15.977
committed relationships? Of course not!

01:16.012 --> 01:17.311
They were in sex balloons!

01:17.347 --> 01:18.680
I... I don't think that's right.

01:18.732 --> 01:21.015
Oh, sure it is. Read Dan Savage.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.684
Farewell, gents!

01:22.769 --> 01:23.685
Thank you, Yang.

01:23.770 --> 01:25.236
Soft hands, Yang.

01:25.321 --> 01:27.021
You've been using my lotion, I see.

01:27.107 --> 01:28.406
Jesus Christ.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.029
Should have asked Mike about the ladies

01:35.081 --> 01:36.364
of Lake Titicaca.

01:36.449 --> 01:37.331
He would have had a good one for that.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.950
Probably.

01:39.035 --> 01:40.868
So much for Columbia Journalism School.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.670
200K down the shitter!

01:42.706 --> 01:45.440
Okay, see you.

01:49.429 --> 01:50.928
Ah!

02:12.736 --> 02:14.402
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.

02:14.487 --> 02:18.406
Don't mind me, just filling
the old water bottle.

02:18.491 --> 02:21.125
I don't mind that because
I'm very pro-hydration.

02:21.211 --> 02:22.577
Okay!

02:22.629 --> 02:24.462
Hi!

02:24.547 --> 02:26.130
You want to go hit
that donut truck again?

02:26.216 --> 02:29.751
I can't, really, right now I...

02:29.836 --> 02:31.753
I got monthly expense reports.

02:31.805 --> 02:33.588
All right, well, would
have been fun to hang.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.508
Yeah, well, uh, sorry
to keep you hanging.

02:37.594 --> 02:40.094
'Cause...

02:40.180 --> 02:43.514
Oh, my gosh.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.768
Well, Mike and, uh, Rosa
both seem over the breakup.

02:46.820 --> 02:48.486
Really? Already?

02:48.571 --> 02:54.009
Yeah, no, he's already
off chasing girls, as per.

02:54.129 --> 02:55.359
- Yep.
- And, uh, yeah,

02:55.445 --> 02:57.111
she seems pretty good
whenever we hang out.

02:57.163 --> 02:58.830
Wait, you're hanging out with her?

02:58.915 --> 03:00.498
Yeah, well, I just mean,
like, we work together,

03:00.583 --> 03:02.033
so she, like, asks me to have lunch

03:02.118 --> 03:04.786
or texts me a funny
YouTube link or something.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.921
You don't think she's, like,
putting out signals, do you?

03:06.956 --> 03:09.540
- Definitely not, no.
- Yeah, no.

03:09.626 --> 03:11.509
- She wouldn't be doing that.
- No.

03:11.594 --> 03:12.794
- No way.
- No.

03:12.879 --> 03:14.345
Why would she? She's a pal.

03:14.430 --> 03:16.180
- That's it.
- That's it.

03:16.266 --> 03:17.799
Just a colleague.

03:21.805 --> 03:23.387
Jesus! Hey, watch where you're going.

03:23.473 --> 03:25.273
- Jesus... what...
- Asshole!

03:35.819 --> 03:36.520
The hell?

03:36.640 --> 03:38.459
_

03:54.804 --> 03:55.720
Ah!

03:56.923 --> 03:58.556
- Wearing a wire?
- No.

03:58.641 --> 04:01.893
I can't be too safe.
I got a lot of enemies.

04:01.978 --> 04:03.845
You got enemies, who? Who are you?

04:03.930 --> 04:07.098
They call me "Spider." You
know what a spider spins?

04:07.183 --> 04:08.516
Truth!

04:08.568 --> 04:10.935
What... what truth is that?

04:11.020 --> 04:13.821
Rosa is into you, man!

04:13.857 --> 04:15.323
Ha-ha-ha!

04:15.358 --> 04:17.074
No, okay, that's a very creative theory.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.577
It's fun to think about.
I've done it myself.

04:19.661 --> 04:21.829
It has been conclusively debunked.

04:21.865 --> 04:23.865
All right, I tried to kiss
her, and she turned me down.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.700
And then she dated my best friend, like,

04:25.752 --> 04:27.451
I... I don't have a chance with her!

04:27.537 --> 04:29.754
And the CIA had nothing
to do with Dallas, ha-ha!

04:29.839 --> 04:31.339
- All right, I... I'm going home.
- Wait!

04:31.374 --> 04:33.007
You don't want to miss
the big show-and-tell!

04:33.042 --> 04:35.259
- Huh?
- Curtains, please, Dreyfus.

04:35.345 --> 04:36.377
Dreyfus?

04:36.429 --> 04:37.879
The mouse did that?

04:37.964 --> 04:41.599
8:48 a.m. today: she's
touching your arm.

04:41.684 --> 04:44.685
11:11 a.m.: another touch, same arm.

04:44.721 --> 04:48.556
different arm, double touch.

04:48.641 --> 04:50.391
Are you beginning to see the pattern?

04:50.443 --> 04:52.643
Rosa touches my arm when
she laughs at my jokes.

04:52.729 --> 04:54.478
Let's talk about those jokes, Joshua.

04:54.564 --> 04:58.232
Let's venture down that
rabbit hole, hmm, hmm?

04:58.284 --> 05:01.569
Yeah, well, uh, sorry
to keep you hanging.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.707
Aha. Where's the joke, Joshua?

05:06.743 --> 05:09.493
Oh, uh, I was doing a little
twist on the word "hang."

05:09.579 --> 05:12.830
I heard the twist, but a twist
doesn't make a good joke, hmm!

05:12.916 --> 05:15.549
If you can tell me one thing

05:15.585 --> 05:18.920
that you said to her that
is even remotely funny,

05:19.005 --> 05:21.088
I will walk away from all of this.

05:21.174 --> 05:23.391
I will buy a suit. I
will join the rat race.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.309
I will sign up for the
country-club dance, ha-ha!

05:25.395 --> 05:26.978
All right, I think we're done here, bud.

05:27.063 --> 05:29.230
Wait! Solve this riddle, Joshua.

05:29.265 --> 05:32.900
If she's not into you,
why does she walk past

05:32.936 --> 05:35.069
your desk every day?

05:35.104 --> 05:36.771
To get more water from the water cooler!

05:36.856 --> 05:38.656
Get more water from the
water cooler... well, then,

05:38.741 --> 05:41.575
check the water cooler, man.

05:41.611 --> 05:44.111
Check the water cooler!

05:49.869 --> 05:51.752
Oh, my God.

05:51.788 --> 05:55.373
Hey, uh, Vincent, how long has
this water cooler been empty?

05:55.458 --> 05:57.959
That's been broken for months.

06:04.968 --> 06:06.434
- Hi, Josh.
- Oh, God!

06:06.469 --> 06:08.469
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.474
So I'm gonna go, uh...

06:15.144 --> 06:16.477
Work at my desk.

06:27.457 --> 06:29.123
So she wasn't filling
up her water bottle;

06:29.158 --> 06:30.825
that was just an excuse
for her to walk past my desk

06:30.910 --> 06:31.909
and talk to me.

06:31.995 --> 06:33.627
Rosa's into me!

06:33.663 --> 06:37.965
Hallelujah, the blind
man has learned to see!

06:38.001 --> 06:40.551
Now we're gonna blow the lid wide open.

06:40.636 --> 06:42.553
We're gonna take this all
the way to the Internet.

06:42.638 --> 06:44.138
We're gonna sing it to
the "Washington Post,"

06:44.173 --> 06:46.007
the AP, the CNN...

06:47.060 --> 06:48.409
Oh!

06:51.481 --> 06:52.313
Spider.

06:52.348 --> 06:54.148
Spider?

06:54.183 --> 06:56.350
Are you okay?

06:56.402 --> 06:58.235
No!

07:02.235 --> 07:03.754
_

07:09.582 --> 07:10.865
Hey, Rosa.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.500
Hey, Josh.

07:12.535 --> 07:15.202
Do you maybe want to grab
a drink with me tomorrow?

07:15.254 --> 07:17.204
I'd love to.

07:17.256 --> 07:18.422
Cool.

07:22.225 --> 07:23.188
Sounds good to me.

07:23.308 --> 07:26.925
All right, see you
tomorrow, Rosa, bye-bye.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.427
It's inevitable.

07:33.684 --> 07:35.400
Mike?

07:35.436 --> 07:37.102
- How's the trip going?
- Ah, cut it short.

07:37.187 --> 07:38.237
I'm actually heading
back home right now.

07:38.272 --> 07:40.188
Uh, why?

07:40.274 --> 07:42.524
Honestly, I just can't
stop thinking about Rosa.

07:42.610 --> 07:44.159
We flew through the Andes this morning,

07:44.245 --> 07:46.111
and all I could do was
stare at her Instagram.

07:46.196 --> 07:48.247
And I know I was putting on
some front like I didn't care,

07:48.282 --> 07:49.848
but I totally care, man.

07:49.917 --> 07:53.619
Oh, so, so you... you still like her?

07:53.704 --> 07:55.170
I don't like her, dude, I love her.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.842
Get rid of it. We got... we got to move.

08:00.928 --> 08:04.263
Yeah, no, I'm, like, crazy
about her... like, obsessed, heh.

08:04.298 --> 08:05.797
Anyway, keep an eye
on her for me, buddy.

08:05.883 --> 08:07.716
- Well, uh...
- Love you, okay.

08:07.801 --> 08:09.551
Why'd you dump that out?

08:09.637 --> 08:13.005
So let me pose a interesting
hypothetical situation.

08:13.073 --> 08:16.224
Let's say there's a guy,
normal guy who likes a girl...

08:16.310 --> 08:17.309
You can't go out with Rosa.

08:17.394 --> 08:19.144
- She's into me.
- Nope.

08:19.229 --> 08:21.213
She's been flirting with
me like crazy and, like,

08:21.282 --> 08:23.482
we're going out for drinks, so.

08:23.567 --> 08:26.151
Josh, this would destroy
your relationship with Mike.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.119
It is a tricky one.

08:27.187 --> 08:28.820
It's not a tricky one!

08:28.889 --> 08:32.157
This is... you should not do
this. It's a horrible idea.

08:32.226 --> 08:34.159
Lot of... lot of moving
parts to consider.

08:34.211 --> 08:36.160
You're really... you're not
gonna listen to me, are you?

08:36.212 --> 08:39.998
At least listen to the
infallible prophet, Tiresias.

08:40.049 --> 08:43.719
Josh, you must abandon this quest!

08:43.804 --> 08:45.671
My God, Tiresias, you know, just because

08:45.723 --> 08:48.006
you're an ancient blind
prophet doesn't mean you have be

08:48.058 --> 08:49.641
such a downer all the time.

08:49.677 --> 08:55.230
My prophecy is written in stone!

08:55.316 --> 08:57.733
Are you doing that thing,
the... the blabbing hand?

08:57.818 --> 09:00.852
I can't see it, but I
can feel it, you know.

09:00.904 --> 09:02.354
We're not trying to hurt you.

09:02.439 --> 09:04.189
I mean, it's just coming
from a bit of, like,

09:04.274 --> 09:06.858
"you guys know better than I
do about my own life" place.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.276
- We weren't.
- No, that's not it.

09:08.362 --> 09:10.078
- We don't want you to get hurt.
- Yeah.

09:10.164 --> 09:12.331
You know, 'cause when
you get hurt, we're hurt.

09:12.366 --> 09:14.199
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's fair.

09:14.251 --> 09:16.368
You know, we feel it, and I
don't want to go through that.

09:16.453 --> 09:18.003
Thanks, guys.

09:18.038 --> 09:19.955
Look, I would love
to say, "Go for Rosa,"

09:20.040 --> 09:23.208
but I can't because the
gods have been super clear

09:23.260 --> 09:24.676
that this will end in doom.

09:24.745 --> 09:26.294
Believe me, you don't want doom.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.046
And we don't want doom for you.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.716
Neither of us do, so come on, kiddo!

09:30.801 --> 09:32.601
This is some straight
talk from the Ti-ster.

09:32.686 --> 09:35.103
You got to abandon this quest.

09:35.189 --> 09:37.723
- Well said.
- Yeah, thank you.

09:37.775 --> 09:40.192
- To good friends...
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.227 --> 09:42.277
And good decisions.

09:42.363 --> 09:44.062
- That's a very loaded toast.
- Well.

09:44.114 --> 09:46.615
So you gonna listen?

09:46.700 --> 09:48.734
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Mm.

09:48.786 --> 09:51.036
Maybe you're right.

09:52.072 --> 09:53.238
Mmm!

09:53.290 --> 09:54.740
Mm.

09:54.792 --> 09:55.741
Thank you.

09:59.663 --> 10:02.964
Tart. Sour apples.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.716
- More margaritas?
- Ayya.

10:04.752 --> 10:06.001
Ay-ya!

10:07.588 --> 10:08.720
Ay-ya!

10:09.807 --> 10:11.890
Sorry, sorry.

10:11.925 --> 10:14.059
Rosa, oh, no, no, no,
before you say anything...

10:14.094 --> 10:15.260
- Oh, my God!
- Before you say anything...

10:15.345 --> 10:16.261
No, no, no, no.

10:16.313 --> 10:17.929
What are you doing here?

10:17.981 --> 10:19.765
I saw on Instagram
that you're at this bar,

10:19.817 --> 10:21.600
and I... I missed you so much, I just...

10:21.685 --> 10:23.318
You really shouldn't have.

10:23.404 --> 10:25.270
Wait a second, are you,
like, with somebody?

10:26.907 --> 10:28.356
Josh?

10:28.442 --> 10:29.691
Um, hey... hey.

10:29.777 --> 10:31.410
- Wha... are you kidding me?
- Shh!

10:31.445 --> 10:33.945
Last night when I was
baring my soul to you,

10:33.997 --> 10:36.498
that whole time you were
skeezing and feeling up on Rosa?

10:36.583 --> 10:38.283
There's a lot of moving parts...

10:38.368 --> 10:40.786
- Unbelievable, man!
- There's a lot of moving parts.

10:41.839 --> 10:44.589
Right, okay, uh...

10:44.625 --> 10:46.341
We told him to abandon this quest.

10:46.427 --> 10:49.127
Honey, if I had eyes, I'd roll them.

10:52.112 --> 10:53.959
Mike! Wait, just let me explain.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.533
Look, there's nothing to explain!

10:55.653 --> 10:57.797
I... I told you I loved
her, and you betrayed me.

10:57.883 --> 10:59.132
Wait a second, it's not like you had

10:59.184 --> 11:01.301
some special claim on her.

11:01.386 --> 11:02.552
You... you had your chance!

11:02.637 --> 11:03.853
And what happened? You blew it.

11:03.939 --> 11:05.889
Oh, my God, that is it, man. Let's go!

11:05.974 --> 11:06.856
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

11:06.942 --> 11:07.974
All right, let's go.

11:09.110 --> 11:12.145
I summon Ultra Mike!

11:12.197 --> 11:16.032
I summon Ultra Josh!

11:21.156 --> 11:23.489
Red stone activation.

11:25.994 --> 11:27.877
Melody recognized.

11:46.815 --> 11:49.015
Sweet mama.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.067
Fighting robots!

11:52.654 --> 11:54.938
No!

11:55.023 --> 11:58.524
I will destroy you, Ultra Josh.

11:58.576 --> 12:01.778
You are the one who
will become destroyed.

12:01.863 --> 12:04.364
At any moment, these two
enemies will unleash a barrage

12:04.449 --> 12:08.167
of violence that will
destroy them and the city.

12:08.203 --> 12:10.536
She wasn't your girlfriend anymore, man.

12:10.622 --> 12:11.838
Still a huge betrayal!

12:11.873 --> 12:13.206
You want to talk about betrayal?

12:13.258 --> 12:15.258
I was on track with Rosa

12:15.343 --> 12:18.011
until you showed up and did your whole

12:18.046 --> 12:19.712
"cool guy Mike" routine

12:19.798 --> 12:23.383
to overshadow me like you always do.

12:23.468 --> 12:25.018
Wait, what are you talking about?

12:25.053 --> 12:26.602
Here comes the violence.

12:27.856 --> 12:28.805
Destruction!

12:31.059 --> 12:34.060
It's always been that
way, man; it's always been

12:34.145 --> 12:36.229
"awesome leader" Mike and

12:36.314 --> 12:37.981
"kid brother" Josh

12:38.066 --> 12:39.565
who never gets the girl.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.734
Whoa.

12:51.413 --> 12:57.750
Dude, I had no idea you
were feeling all this pain.

12:57.802 --> 13:01.587
Why didn't you just unburden
yourself and tell me?

13:01.673 --> 13:05.425
Because you're my best
friend, Ultra Mike.

13:05.510 --> 13:08.594
And I guess that's why
I bottled it all up,

13:08.680 --> 13:12.315
because I'm scared to
death of losing you.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.316
Shoot your lasers!

13:13.401 --> 13:15.268
Let's go!

13:15.353 --> 13:20.573
I feel the same way
about you, Ultra Josh.

13:56.528 --> 13:59.695
You know what?

13:59.781 --> 14:02.231
We can't let this thing
with Rosa get between us.

14:04.486 --> 14:06.386
Our friendship's more important.

14:06.454 --> 14:07.904
You're right, man.

14:07.989 --> 14:09.822
So I guess there's only one solution.

14:09.874 --> 14:13.159
We let her decide.

14:13.211 --> 14:16.662
One shall stand. One shall fall.

14:16.714 --> 14:20.666
Rosa, who is it going to be?

14:20.752 --> 14:23.669
I don't want to date
either of you morons!

14:23.738 --> 14:24.637
Oh.

14:24.706 --> 14:26.089
Huh.

14:26.174 --> 14:27.640
You've been fighting over me all day,

14:27.675 --> 14:30.176
and it is extremely
patronizing, let me tell you!

14:30.261 --> 14:32.945
I mean, Josh!

14:33.014 --> 14:34.397
I'm not attracted to you!

14:34.482 --> 14:36.015
Oh.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.484
I tried to make it work!
Your head is really big!

14:38.520 --> 14:40.570
You're a nerd!

14:40.655 --> 14:42.321
And, Mike!

14:42.357 --> 14:44.073
You scare the shit out of me!

14:44.159 --> 14:45.324
Okay.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.360
And these stupid robot suits?

14:50.415 --> 14:52.165
Hit each other or something!

15:00.091 --> 15:02.341
Yeah.

15:02.377 --> 15:04.210
All right, um.

15:04.262 --> 15:07.463
You want to get, like,
a smoothie or something?

15:07.549 --> 15:11.017
Yeah, I could [bleep]
with a smoothie right now.

15:11.052 --> 15:13.636
I'm doing a lot of goji berries
lately; you ever try those?

15:13.721 --> 15:16.889
Yeah, no, they keep coming
up in my Twitter feed.

15:16.975 --> 15:19.525
What are goji berries?

15:19.561 --> 15:23.479
I guess they're, like, some
kind of berry, or something.

15:23.565 --> 15:27.066
I just have to say this is
a sad day for robot fighting

15:27.118 --> 15:28.367
and for this city.

15:30.071 --> 15:32.989
You are a fiend for new berries.

15:33.074 --> 15:34.740
Let's go get some smoothies, pal.

15:48.504 --> 15:50.671
Oh.

15:50.707 --> 15:52.006
Josh.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.958
Hi... how you doing, Spider?

15:54.043 --> 15:57.712
- Well, you know, pretty bad.
- Yeah.

15:57.797 --> 16:01.015
- 12 bullets to the chest.
- Jesus.

16:01.050 --> 16:04.051
- Baker's dozen down below.
- Ugh.

16:04.137 --> 16:09.357
But it's all worth it
because you and Rosa

16:09.392 --> 16:12.310
are finally together as a couple.

16:12.395 --> 16:16.564
Yeah... that... uh... that
didn't actually work out.

16:16.649 --> 16:18.783
What?

16:18.868 --> 16:22.036
Yeah, but Mike and I are friends again!

16:22.071 --> 16:23.154
Who the [bleep] is Mike?

16:23.239 --> 16:24.739
That's my best friend.

16:24.791 --> 16:28.826
Well, that's kind of a
happy ending, I guess.

16:28.912 --> 16:30.878
Mr. Spider, your test
results came in, and, uh...

16:30.914 --> 16:32.580
- Uh
- Huh?

16:32.632 --> 16:34.632
I'm afraid you're definitely gonna die.

16:34.717 --> 16:35.917
Oh.

16:35.969 --> 16:37.668
Well.

16:37.754 --> 16:41.222
I got you... uh... a... a gift bag, uh.

16:41.257 --> 16:42.974
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.

16:43.059 --> 16:47.311
Yeah, yeah, there's, uh,
some, uh, rocky road ice cream,

16:47.397 --> 16:51.399
and, um... a bear, so.

16:51.434 --> 16:54.235
Well, look, Josh, the
only gift that I need

16:54.270 --> 16:58.439
is your friendship and your
presence in the room right now.

16:58.491 --> 17:00.858
Josh?

17:00.944 --> 17:02.243
Josh?

17:06.082 --> 17:08.800
Ah, you guys, this
has been a crazy year.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.146
- Yeah.
- Crazy.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.453
- Wow.
- Crazy year.

17:12.538 --> 17:15.623
We fought; we loved;
we laughed; we learned.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.290
You know, guys, it wasn't always easy...

17:17.377 --> 17:18.342
Mm-mm.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.844
But we did it together.

17:19.929 --> 17:21.963
We were together every step
of the way this entire year.

17:22.015 --> 17:23.631
Mm-hmm.

17:23.683 --> 17:24.965
And that's how the four
of us got through it.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.099
You're right.

17:26.135 --> 17:27.685
It's been so great, Tiresias.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.520
Yeah, thanks for always
being there for us.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.305
Oh, speaking of being always there me,

17:31.357 --> 17:33.107
what do you think I should text?

17:33.142 --> 17:34.976
Oh! Um, how many dates is this?

17:35.061 --> 17:36.477
Three... okay, four,

17:36.529 --> 17:37.979
but the first one we
just made out in a bar.

17:38.064 --> 17:39.530
Hmm.

17:39.615 --> 17:41.282
Okay, well it should
be clever but romantic.

17:41.317 --> 17:42.650
Dick pic, bro.

17:42.735 --> 17:44.702
Or how about... how about
this, how about you just text,

17:44.787 --> 17:48.322
"Hey, this is Tiresias.
Want to grab a coffee?"

17:48.374 --> 17:49.824
Oh, simple, direct.

17:49.909 --> 17:52.126
The gods are saying it might work.

17:52.161 --> 17:53.494
Hey.

17:53.546 --> 17:54.462
Hey, you're pretty good at this.

17:54.497 --> 17:55.663
Yeah.

17:55.715 --> 17:57.798
Yeah, I'm getting better.
