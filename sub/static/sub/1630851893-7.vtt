00:16.225 --> 00:20.020
Sometimes I take out
your letters and verses, dear friend,

00:20.771 --> 00:23.732
and when I feel their strange power,

00:24.816 --> 00:26.276
I find it hard to write.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.782
I think that if I could once see you
and know that you're real,

00:33.116 --> 00:34.451
I might fare better.

00:35.619 --> 00:39.957
It is hard for me to understand
how you can live so alone

00:40.040 --> 00:43.168
with thoughts of such a quality
coming up in you.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.672
Yet, it isolates anyone
to think beyond a certain point

00:46.755 --> 00:50.801
or have such luminous flashes
as come to you.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.096
So perhaps
the place does not make much difference.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.099
You must come down to Boston sometimes?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.309
All ladies do.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.022
Ever your friend, Higginson.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.068
Emily.

01:08.944 --> 01:09.945
Emily.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.197
Mom's still in bed,
it's Maggie's week off,

01:12.281 --> 01:14.449
and we don't have indoor plumbing. So…

01:16.118 --> 01:17.536
you need to go fetch the water.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.620
You know what?

01:20.539 --> 01:22.916
Sometimes I feel like
I was born in the wrong century.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.477
What a beautiful spring day!

01:43.061 --> 01:44.605
Good morning, sunshine.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.108
Did you know that I speak Dutch?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.486
It is a beautiful day.
Wish the mail would come.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.405
Why? 'Cause you have a crush
on the mailman?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.491
What? No.
I'm waiting for a letter from Henry.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.745
-Not this mess again.
-Starting to fear the worst.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.080
If I don't hear from him soon,

02:02.164 --> 02:06.376
what other explanation could there be
than that he's… dead?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.753
-I can think of another explanation.
-You can?

02:08.836 --> 02:11.465
Look, I don't know
where Henry's been traveling,

02:11.548 --> 02:14.176
but a man is only led by one thing,
and it's not his compass.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.012
Wherever he is, he probably fell into bed
with someone else.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.932
Even if he has,
he could still write to Helen.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.142
Girl, who are you protecting?

02:22.226 --> 02:24.478
He left your whole ass and Helen's.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.605
You need to start putting yourself
back out there.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.359
-Excuse me?
-You need to start dating again.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.819
You're asking me to date
in the middle of the Civil War?

02:32.903 --> 02:37.282
Look, it's never a good time,
but despite the war, it's still spring.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.952
Birds are singing. Flowers are blooming.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.162
Spring is the season for new love,

02:42.246 --> 02:45.165
not for moping around missing your ex

02:45.249 --> 02:48.377
who always put you second
to his abolitionist literary journal.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.670
You need to let go of the past

02:49.753 --> 02:51.797
and start building yourself
a new future. Come on!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.757
You make it sound so easy.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.177
How do you stay so optimistic?

02:57.261 --> 02:59.972
Because God called me to testify
to the hope that's in me.

03:00.055 --> 03:05.769
And right now, I hope that my friend Betty
gets her proverbial groove back.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.189
Who would I even meet at a time like this?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.816
Morning, ladies!

03:21.618 --> 03:22.870
-Him?
-Why not?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.164
-I don't think I can. I'm not ready.
-No time like the present.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.875
Any mail for us today, Freddie?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.251
No, unfortunately.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.379
I always wish I could bring something
for you, Betty.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.590
I love seeing
that beautiful smile of yours.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.258
Nice day for a walk, isn't it?

03:36.341 --> 03:37.885
I know who could use a walk.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.345
Amherst's most hardworking seamstress.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.390
You're welcome to come along
with me on my rounds.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.310
That's not a date, that's a job.
Take her on a picnic or something.

03:46.393 --> 03:50.439
Well, we could do that
if you're amenable to the suggestion.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.357
I--

03:54.151 --> 03:55.527
I'd like that, actually.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.238
I could use some fresh air.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.952
But remember,
it's often darkest right before the dawn.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.708
I lecture to testify
to the hope that's in me!

04:09.791 --> 04:11.877
Bitch, I'm 60!

04:15.464 --> 04:16.673
Emily.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.931
Up here.

04:25.974 --> 04:26.975
Sue.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.686
What are you doing up there?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.355
I was waiting for you.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
We need to talk.

04:33.899 --> 04:34.942
Yeah, we do.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.991
Why haven't you come to see me?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.620
Well, I thought you were mad at me.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.164
I am mad at you.
That's why you should've come to see me.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.374
Sue, listen.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.169
It's really not fair of you
to be angry at me

04:54.253 --> 04:57.589
just because I reached out
to someone else about my work.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.508
It has nothing to do with you.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.426
It has everything to do with me.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.137
You once told me
that you wrote for me and me alone.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.974
But I guess my thoughts aren't enough
for you anymore.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.768
Now that I've had a baby,
my brain is worthless, I suppose.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.479
No, you've barely had time for my poetry
since you had the baby.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.147
And you've barely had time for my baby

05:14.231 --> 05:16.692
since you're constantly writing
your goddamn poems!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.529
There it is then.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.240
You don't even care
about my poems anymore.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.575
Of course I do. I just--

05:24.658 --> 05:27.369
Then why should you take it personally
when I reach out to someone else

05:27.452 --> 05:28.704
-for his opinion?
-A man?

05:28.787 --> 05:31.748
A stranger?
Someone who doesn't even know you?

05:31.832 --> 05:32.916
Exactly!

05:33.917 --> 05:35.669
He doesn't even know me.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.462
He only knows my words.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.883
I don't have to worry
about his feelings getting involved.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.386
Like when you tell me you hate a stanza.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.308
Maybe you're just angry
because I didn't help you change diapers.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.643
Or worse, when you say you love a line,

05:51.727 --> 05:53.937
well, maybe all that really means
is that you love me.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.565
I do love you, Emily,
and what is wrong with that?

05:58.692 --> 06:02.070
God, it is so unfair living like this.
It's miserable.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.325
All I want is to be with you,

06:06.408 --> 06:08.619
is to curl up in bed with you at night.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.247
And instead, I have to wait
days and weeks with nothing.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.124
Not nothing.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.044
I write to you. Isn't that something?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.755
Emily, you are a poet.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.715
You work so hard on your poems.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.717
You want every line to be perfect.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.010
But I want the mess.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.096
I want something
that you can't put into words.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.058
I want you.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.810
And I want you to want me.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.979
Of course I want you.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.316
But I can't just live at your house.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.735
For one thing,
Austin isn't even speaking to me.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.819
Okay.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.948
And what if Austin goes away to war?
What then?

06:47.241 --> 06:50.702
-What do you mean?
-They're drafting every able-bodied man.

06:50.786 --> 06:51.995
His time will come.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.041
When Austin goes away to fight,
will you come see me then?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.168
Or will you just find another excuse?

07:01.505 --> 07:02.840
I better get back with this water.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.216
It's going to rain.

07:04.842 --> 07:05.843
Kiss me.

07:10.806 --> 07:11.807
I can't.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.852
Today is just not a good day.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.355
Oh, God, Emily.
Don't you realize today is all we have?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.861
The agony!

07:26.029 --> 07:27.239
The torture.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.121
Vinnie?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.207
Vinnie? What's wrong?

07:39.084 --> 07:40.085
Look at me,

07:40.169 --> 07:44.173
doing menial household labor
day in, day out for my mother,

07:44.256 --> 07:47.009
when what I want, what I dream of,

07:47.092 --> 07:49.887
is to do menial household labor
day in, day out

07:49.970 --> 07:52.848
for my gorgeous,
emotionally unavailable husband.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.143
God, I just can't take it anymore.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.313
Honestly, I can't either. Life sucks.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.065
I'm terminally single,
America's in a Civil War,

08:02.149 --> 08:03.775
and now it's raining.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.944
Yeah, today is the worst day ever.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.070
Yeah.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.822
Every day of this war,

08:08.906 --> 08:11.700
I have hoped and hoped
that things would somehow get better,

08:12.284 --> 08:13.785
that the skies would clear,

08:13.869 --> 08:16.330
that somehow we would see our way
to a brighter future.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.040
But none of that is happening.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.751
Our family is falling apart.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.836
I want to go back to the past.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.715
Before the war started,
before all my boyfriends died.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.926
No, I'd rather go to the future.

08:29.009 --> 08:33.388
Skip over all this mess to when the war
is over and everything is different.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.390
Imagine if we could just blink…

08:38.184 --> 08:40.102
and be in the future. Just like that.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.734
-Did you see that?
-What was that?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.069
What is happening?

08:49.905 --> 08:51.073
Emily.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.575
-Vinnie?
-Yeah?

08:53.659 --> 08:55.702
-Are we moving?
-I think so.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.287
Emily?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.665
-What is happening?
-I don't know.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.793
-Vinnie!
-Emily!

09:02.876 --> 09:03.877
Oh, my God!

09:11.385 --> 09:12.886
What was that?

09:12.970 --> 09:14.054
What just happened?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.641
The gazebo was spinning.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.560
Yeah, and then it stopped.

09:19.643 --> 09:20.894
And it stopped raining.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.772
-Vinnie?
-Yeah?

09:23.856 --> 09:25.941
Does the house seem different
to you somehow?

09:27.276 --> 09:29.403
-Wait a-- Emily, I'm scared.
-What was--

09:32.072 --> 09:35.784
-That carriage has no horses!
-And there's smoke coming out of its butt!

09:35.868 --> 09:36.869
What?

09:38.537 --> 09:40.539
-Oh, my--
-What?

09:49.298 --> 09:50.340
What?

09:55.888 --> 09:57.306
1955?

09:59.141 --> 10:00.767
We're in the future!

10:09.568 --> 10:10.694
Mrs. Dickinson?

10:12.112 --> 10:15.240
How dare you disturb me, Edward?
I'm in my sanctuary.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.578
I found something quite concerning.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.539
In Emily's greenhouse.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.625
I thought you'd like to know.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.711
What? The greenhouse?
What are you talking about?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.717
She had this growing in there,
amongst her plants.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.262
Okay. What is it?

10:38.680 --> 10:42.684
This, Mrs. Dickinson, is cannabis.

10:43.769 --> 10:44.895
I beg your pardon?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.396
Cannabis sativa.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.358
Otherwise known as hemp,
hashish, the devil's weed.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.527
It's a fashionable narcotic.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.487
The Orientals, they roll it up
and they smoke it.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.988
It gets you high, Mrs. Dickinson.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.824
Well, I'm sure Emily doesn't know
anything about that.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.827
She probably just grew it
because it's pretty.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.455
Perhaps you're right.
Maybe she had no idea.

11:03.539 --> 11:04.957
But this stuff is dangerous.

11:05.040 --> 11:10.128
It can lead to all sorts of ecstasies,
dreams, delusions.

11:10.963 --> 11:11.964
Well…

11:13.090 --> 11:14.091
Should we try it?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.512
What? Should we?

11:19.638 --> 11:21.139
You only live once.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.434
-Hello?
-It's locked.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.228
-Hello?
-It's locked, and we're in the future.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.397
This is great. This is wonderful.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.899
This is our house. They have to let us in.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.235
"They" who? Who do you think is in there?

11:33.318 --> 11:36.488
Emily, we just traveled
a hundred years forward in time.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.157
Our entire family is dead.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.411
Okay, well, I'm gonna need some answers,
and I'm gonna need them fast.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.251
You can't get in.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.211
They keep it locked
every day except Tuesday.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.881
Why are you dressed
like loony old grandmas?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.884
This must be your Mountain Day attire.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.427
I get it. Fun.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.012
-Mountain Day?
-Yes.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.681
Smith College Mountain Day.
Happens once a semester.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.016
All classes are canceled,

12:04.099 --> 12:06.101
and everyone's
free to roam around outside,

12:06.185 --> 12:07.686
playing pranks or what have you.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.356
Don't you just love all-female colleges
and their wacky traditions?

12:11.440 --> 12:15.194
All-female colleges?
So women can go to college now?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.362
Obviously. Look at us, we're on campus.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.657
Wow! Women's lives in this period
seem pretty great.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.701
No, they're depressing.

12:23.202 --> 12:25.996
I've had several mental breakdowns
and tried to kill myself.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.665
I'm a senior. What year are you?

12:28.749 --> 12:32.252
We-- We're from 1862.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.546
Okay, committed to the bit.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.507
Got the corsets on and everything.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.842
I don't know how you breathe
in those things.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.011
Anyway, step aside, please.
I'm heading in.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.305
You have a key?

12:43.931 --> 12:46.350
I know where they hide it.
I come here quite a lot.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.268
You do? Why?

12:48.352 --> 12:49.728
Because I'm a poet.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.940
And this is the home of the great
American poet, Emily Dickinson.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.610
So…

12:58.070 --> 13:00.697
Emily Dickinson lived here?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.282
A long time ago, yes.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.742
Now it's all boarded up,

13:03.825 --> 13:06.912
although the college trustees give tours
every once in a while.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.165
-I've taken quite a few.
-You said you're a poet?

13:10.249 --> 13:12.334
Yes. Trying to be.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.963
Although I have to admit
sometimes my brain feels like a black hole

13:16.046 --> 13:18.298
out of which
no beauty or truth could ever come.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.885
Might be because of the electroshock
they gave me in the psych ward.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.096
Or maybe it's my winning personality.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.765
Tell us, what is your name?

13:28.100 --> 13:29.434
I'm Sylvia.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.769
Sylvia Plath.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.730
Great American poet.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.487
The Future never spoke -

13:41.864 --> 13:43.949
Nor will he like the Dumb

13:45.158 --> 13:47.286
Reveal by sign a syllable

13:48.579 --> 13:50.706
Of his profound To Come -

14:02.509 --> 14:03.510
Colonel Higginson?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.055
If I may request your attention, sir?

14:07.139 --> 14:08.849
Henry. Fist bump.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.562
Wasn't expecting you. Come on in.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.984
Just trying to wrap my head around
this here map.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.569
I've never been good with maps.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.198
But tell me, what's on your mind?

14:30.162 --> 14:32.456
You're aware that
Confederates are on the march

14:32.539 --> 14:34.374
and that not long from now

14:34.458 --> 14:38.045
the heat of battle will reach the base
here in Beaufort itself.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.213
Yes.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.757
In fact, if I understand
this thing correctly,

14:41.840 --> 14:43.675
our enemy is coming from right here…

14:44.176 --> 14:46.678
and will be engaging us…

14:46.762 --> 14:49.723
somewhere here.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.436
It's gonna be messy.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.273
You know, Henry…

15:00.859 --> 15:02.319
Sometimes I wish I could just be back

15:02.402 --> 15:04.404
in the comfortable offices
of the Atlantic magazine,

15:04.988 --> 15:06.198
giving advice to young poets.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.911
Writing essays about the life of birds
seems like paradise to me right now.

15:11.662 --> 15:12.663
War is hell.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.665
I'm right there with you, Colonel.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.251
But what I am asking is,

15:17.334 --> 15:20.295
when battle comes,
what would you have our men do?

15:20.879 --> 15:23.215
You've drilled them and tested them,

15:23.298 --> 15:27.803
you've dressed them up like soldiers,
but you haven't armed them with weapons.

15:27.886 --> 15:32.808
Are they expected to line up
and perish as mere cannon fodder?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.852
The men have been ordered
by General Saxton

15:34.935 --> 15:36.562
to reinforce the barricades.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.022
With all due respect, Colonel,

15:39.106 --> 15:42.359
it's starting to feel like
the real barricades are in this very room.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.157
The moment Lincoln approves,
there will be guns in my soldiers' hands.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.868
But what if that day never comes?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.495
It will come! It will!

15:54.079 --> 15:56.498
But if we move too fast,

15:56.582 --> 15:58.959
we may lose all the ground
that we've already gained.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.461
You don't understand
how much scrutiny I'm under here,

16:01.545 --> 16:03.255
trying to set up this regiment.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.591
It's like trying to plant a crop
that wants to take root,

16:05.674 --> 16:08.468
but it's constantly being pulled up
to see how it's growing.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.638
The slightest mistake could send us back
a hundred years.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.058
-You can't imagine--
-I can imagine it, sir.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.520
I think-- I live it every damn day.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.189
Well, what would you have me do?

16:22.399 --> 16:25.068
Just go against the president's orders,
hand over the weapons?

16:26.236 --> 16:30.282
That certainly sounds like
something a radical activist would do.

16:30.908 --> 16:31.909
Well…

16:33.285 --> 16:34.453
I can't do that.

16:35.954 --> 16:36.955
I see.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.961
But…

16:45.839 --> 16:46.840
But…

16:50.093 --> 16:54.264
If somebody wanted to arm these men,
I would tell them what they could do.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.559
They could…

16:58.560 --> 17:01.188
intercept the delivery of fresh rifles
that's expected today

17:01.271 --> 17:02.564
along the shell road.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.445
They could tell the driver
from the factory in Charleston

17:09.530 --> 17:11.865
that they were sent on my orders
as a middleman.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.786
These factory workers don't know anything
about military rules,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.371
so they'll take a man at his word.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.915
A whole wagonful of guns

17:22.125 --> 17:25.420
would be handed over just like that.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.102
Colonel Higginson?

17:40.686 --> 17:41.770
Yes.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.322
What have they done to my bedroom?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.117
That is not even my quilt.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.869
Your Method acting goes deep.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.413
Did you train with Strasberg in New York?

17:59.496 --> 18:01.039
I hear he hates women.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.632
The wallpaper is faded,

18:11.675 --> 18:13.093
and that painting doesn't go in here.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.636
But the desk is in the right place.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.681
Yes, right by the southwest-facing window.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.893
Wow. Okay.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.103
Just sitting down
like you own the place.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.981
This is how I commune with Emily's spirit.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.572
Funny. I'm having a hard time
contacting her today.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.865
Well, I'm right here, so…

18:38.577 --> 18:39.828
This should help.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.123
-What's that?
-The Poems of Emily Dickinson.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.126
The complete collection was published
just this year.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.967
I thought I told you
to burn all my poems when I died.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.136
I knew you didn't mean it.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.347
I wasn't gonna
let everyone forget my sister.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.683
And now look, in the future,
you're actually famous.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.893
Well, not that famous.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.980
More of a local legend.

19:07.064 --> 19:10.984
An obscure, strange female poet
who lived a sad, miserable life.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.069
That's not true.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.864
Most people in the 20th century
don't really care about Emily Dickinson.

19:16.573 --> 19:20.244
They'd happily leave her poems
in an attic somewhere, collecting dust.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.288
But I care. I feel a kinship with her.

19:24.248 --> 19:27.209
She was morbidly depressed.
I'm morbidly depressed.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.585
She wasn't. She was not-- I'm not--

19:28.669 --> 19:31.004
Did you know
she spent her entire life alone?

19:31.088 --> 19:32.297
What do you mean "alone"?

19:32.381 --> 19:35.968
She was a virgin.
A miserable, dried-up spinster.

19:36.051 --> 19:40.097
Never got married, never found love.
Hardly even left her room.

19:40.180 --> 19:44.101
The only thing Emily Dickinson did
was wear white and cry.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.688
That's not accurate.
She almost never wears white.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.983
Emily Dickinson is not depressed.
She does not want to die.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.902
She wants to live and connect
with the world through her words.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.072
I would argue
she died alone in her bedroom.

19:57.739 --> 20:02.411
Okay. I am Emily Dickinson, so I think
I know how Emily Dickinson feels.

20:02.494 --> 20:06.498
Your commitment
to this Mountain Day bit is alarming.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.793
Where do you get your information?

20:09.877 --> 20:11.295
It's common knowledge.

20:12.421 --> 20:15.340
Emily Dickinson was the original sad girl.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.010
I mean, her life was so awful.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.387
They say she had a love affair with a man,

20:20.470 --> 20:22.890
someone she was crazy about
who didn't love her back.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.558
Oh, my God.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.143
-A man. Is that true?
-No.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.686
-No, it's--
-Yes, there was a man,

20:27.769 --> 20:30.314
but no one knows who,
and it was totally unrequited.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.358
So, I can only assume
she wanted to kill herself.

20:33.442 --> 20:34.860
Undoubtedly she tried.

20:34.943 --> 20:39.323
Just like me when I slashed my legs up
and took my mother's sleeping pills.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.449
-Yikes.
-Okay.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.911
I never tried to kill myself.
I would never try to kill myself.

20:43.994 --> 20:45.537
And I was not in love with a man.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.915
-Emily. Was it George?
-No.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.166
-Frazar?
-No!

20:49.249 --> 20:51.668
It couldn't have been… Toshiaki?

20:52.252 --> 20:55.506
Okay. Lavinia, I have never in my life
been in love with a man.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.257
You know, you might be right.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.386
There was a book published a few years ago
that caused such a scandal,

21:01.470 --> 21:03.013
it almost didn't get published.

21:03.805 --> 21:09.728
Because in this book, the author says
that Emily Dickinson was a lesbian.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.607
-A what?
-A lesbian.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.193
No, she was an American.

21:17.069 --> 21:18.111
What?

21:18.195 --> 21:20.405
I'm talking about sex, baby.

21:20.489 --> 21:25.536
She was a sapphic, a homosexual,
a woman who loved other women.

21:26.119 --> 21:30.123
Surely you must be familiar.
You do go to Smith College.

21:30.207 --> 21:33.085
Emily, is… that true?

21:33.168 --> 21:34.461
I…

21:34.545 --> 21:36.588
Oh, my God. Who?

21:36.672 --> 21:38.090
Sorry, can we change the subject?

21:38.173 --> 21:40.843
I-- Why are we talking
about her private life?

21:40.926 --> 21:42.427
Shouldn't we be focusing on her poems?

21:42.511 --> 21:44.471
Do you really think
you can pull the two apart?

21:45.597 --> 21:47.683
I mean,
where do you think poetry comes from,

21:47.766 --> 21:52.145
other than passion, desire,
the darkest depths?

21:52.646 --> 21:55.065
Personally, I think Dante had it right.

21:56.108 --> 22:02.573
To write poetry, you have to be willing
to go all the way down to hell.

22:03.907 --> 22:07.703
Okay, your energy is so intense,
and this is Emily Dickinson saying that.

22:11.582 --> 22:14.918
"I dreamed that you bewitched me
into bed"…

22:15.002 --> 22:16.003
Okay.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.631
…"And sung me moonstruck,
kissed me quite insane.

22:20.591 --> 22:23.302
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

22:24.261 --> 22:27.806
God topples from the sky,
hell's fires fade:

22:28.307 --> 22:30.976
Exit seraphim and Satan's men:

22:31.476 --> 22:37.191
I shut my eyes
and all the world drops dead."

22:39.026 --> 22:41.737
Cool. Well, we're gonna go.
Hopefully back to 1862.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.697
Yeah, the future wasn't really
what we expected.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.157
The future?

22:45.657 --> 22:46.783
Don't you know?

22:47.784 --> 22:49.995
The future never comes for women.

22:52.581 --> 22:53.749
-Vinnie?
-Yeah?

22:53.832 --> 22:55.083
How are we gonna get home?

23:25.072 --> 23:27.282
I feel incredibly strange.

23:27.366 --> 23:28.700
That means it's working.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.870
The likelihood
of me ever getting out of this bed

23:31.954 --> 23:35.457
just went from zero
to whatever's way below that.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.876
They're gonna have to cart me outta here
in my coffin.

23:43.257 --> 23:45.676
-In a coffin.
-Let me hit that again.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.803
-Nope. It's all gone. We smoked it all.
-No, no, no.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.721
-I need it.
-We smoked it all.

23:49.805 --> 23:50.806
I'm so hungry.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.183
-Go make some food.
-No, you go make some food.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.978
-I will not.
-I'm starving.

23:56.687 --> 23:57.771
And I'm a man.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.608
And I don't know how to cook food.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.569
I don't think I like this stuff.

24:03.652 --> 24:05.028
What, the cannabis? Why not?

24:05.112 --> 24:07.197
Because before I just felt sad.

24:07.281 --> 24:11.743
But now I feel sad, hungry, dizzy,

24:12.995 --> 24:14.997
and a little bit paranoid.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.125
You're putting off
some dreadfully dreary vibes.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.252
Please leave me alone again.

24:20.335 --> 24:23.172
And when you go down to the kitchen,
count the spoons.

24:23.255 --> 24:25.048
Maggie is not to be trusted.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.137
Well, I think I'll just take
a little nap myself.

24:31.805 --> 24:32.806
Here's to that.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.229
It's so messed up, man.

24:39.730 --> 24:44.067
I mean, I actually--
I care about my child, you know?

24:44.151 --> 24:46.361
I-- I wanna hold him.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.156
I wanna raise him.

24:49.865 --> 24:51.074
I wanna smell him.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.826
I've barely even gotten to know him yet,

24:52.910 --> 24:55.871
and then this bullshit happens,

24:56.914 --> 24:59.291
and it's just like, what?

25:00.584 --> 25:02.836
I have to go off and die now?

25:03.420 --> 25:04.963
You don't have to do
anything you don't want.

25:06.256 --> 25:08.258
Yeah, no, I do though.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.093
It's called a draft.

25:10.177 --> 25:12.095
It's, like, a legal process.

25:12.179 --> 25:15.474
I'm a lawyer,
so I know about these things.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.894
Exactly. You're a lawyer,
and the son of a lawyer.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.231
I mean, hello. You're rich.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.316
Rich people can do whatever they want.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.777
That's the first law
of the United States of America.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.488
I don't know, man. My name's on the list.

25:30.072 --> 25:34.451
Okay. So you pay someone else
to call himself by your name.

25:36.828 --> 25:37.829
You can do that?

25:38.455 --> 25:41.834
There's a way out of any situation,
if you can afford it.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.919
Yeah, but who could I pay?

25:44.628 --> 25:45.629
Anyone.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.922
That guy.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.299
That guy.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.134
Or him.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.387
Need another round, chaps?

25:53.470 --> 25:54.596
Make it a double.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.474
The guy's always desperate for tips.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.394
Going rate for draft dodging is 500 bucks.
That's like a million to him.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.604
Pretty sure he'd jump at the chance.

26:06.692 --> 26:07.901
Nah, I could never.

26:08.569 --> 26:09.570
Sure.

26:12.865 --> 26:15.325
Let's have another drink
and see if you reconsider.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.704
At least it stopped raining.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.956
I don't notice the weather.

26:22.958 --> 26:26.879
Sun, rain, snow.
None of it makes no difference to me.

26:26.962 --> 26:30.883
If you're a postal worker,
you can't let the weather get to you.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.801
It's all a part of the deal.

26:32.885 --> 26:35.429
Thunder, heat waves, hail.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.805
They won't stop me.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.640
I always make my deliveries.

26:39.725 --> 26:40.726
I admire that.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.352
Sorry. I don't mean to bore you.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.480
-What? No.
-I know not everybody's as interested

26:45.564 --> 26:47.733
as I am in the functionings
of the mail system.

26:47.816 --> 26:51.069
No, no, no. I love the US Postal Service.

26:51.153 --> 26:53.155
I just-- It's--

26:53.238 --> 26:55.115
You know what? I'm a little tired.

26:55.199 --> 26:56.533
I can only imagine.

26:58.118 --> 27:00.078
Doing this all by yourself.

27:00.162 --> 27:01.622
It's not so bad.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.081
Raising a child.

27:03.165 --> 27:05.125
Keeping your business afloat.

27:05.209 --> 27:06.668
You're a strong woman, Betty.

27:07.878 --> 27:09.505
But these are dangerous times.

27:11.048 --> 27:13.634
And even a strong woman could use
a man to protect her.

27:14.343 --> 27:16.178
I can protect myself.

27:17.095 --> 27:19.264
And as for Helen,

27:20.265 --> 27:23.685
I still haven't given up hope
that her father might come back.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.021
Back from Beaufort?

27:26.980 --> 27:29.024
-Not likely.
-From where?

27:29.775 --> 27:32.194
Henry's in Beaufort, South Carolina.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.697
-I thought you knew.
-No.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.701
No, as you're well aware,
I haven't had a letter from him in months.

27:40.702 --> 27:44.164
-Have you?
-Not directly. But word travels.

27:44.248 --> 27:47.835
He's been down there for a while now
with the South Carolina Volunteers.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.629
A part of the Port Royal Experiment.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.130
Imagine.

27:52.631 --> 27:56.844
Black men enlisted in a Union Army,
training to fight.

27:56.927 --> 28:00.180
Henry is a soldier now?

28:00.264 --> 28:01.473
That's what I heard.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.226
And if you don't mind my saying so,

28:05.352 --> 28:08.647
his chances of making it back here alive
are about as good as…

28:09.815 --> 28:10.816
well…

28:11.900 --> 28:14.444
are about as good as
a two-pound parcel being delivered

28:14.528 --> 28:16.238
with only a five-cent stamp.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.006
Great.

29:16.089 --> 29:19.468
This morning we were stuck in the present,
and now we're stuck in the future.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.011
Okay, but while we're here…

29:22.346 --> 29:24.389
-I have to ask.
-What?

29:24.473 --> 29:26.141
Is it true,

29:26.767 --> 29:30.354
what she said
about you loving other women?

29:34.775 --> 29:35.984
It's Sue.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.363
It's always been Sue. I love Sue.

29:41.615 --> 29:43.033
I think I knew that.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.579
Well, now it doesn't matter,
because I ruined it.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.706
What do you mean, you ruined it?

29:50.415 --> 29:51.416
I don't know.

29:51.917 --> 29:56.880
Look, I guess sometimes
I just find it easier to be in love

29:56.964 --> 30:03.554
when I'm writing a poem
than when I'm actually, you know, not.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.181
Well, I will tell you what I think.

30:08.225 --> 30:11.270
I think you are so unbelievably lucky

30:11.353 --> 30:13.897
to have someone you truly love
to spend your life with.

30:14.815 --> 30:17.943
If I had that, I would be so happy.

30:18.652 --> 30:21.113
And if that person was alive,
in the present,

30:21.196 --> 30:22.865
with me in the here and now…

30:24.366 --> 30:27.995
well, I would run right into their arms
and never let them go.

30:31.582 --> 30:33.417
Shit, Vinnie, you're right.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.337
Why did I ever want to go to the future?

30:37.421 --> 30:39.339
I had everything in the present.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.216
I had Sue.

30:55.647 --> 30:57.608
Oh, my God. We made it!

30:58.692 --> 31:02.112
-We're not in the future anymore.
-What are you talking about?

31:02.196 --> 31:03.864
We were just in the future.

31:05.824 --> 31:08.493
I just went to the outhouse
to dump my mother's bedpan

31:08.577 --> 31:10.162
because my life is a nightmare,

31:10.245 --> 31:12.623
and then I came into this gazebo
and started crying.

31:12.706 --> 31:15.417
And then you came in here
and started blubbering all about Sue,

31:16.001 --> 31:18.086
and then we actually had
a really nice talk.

31:20.255 --> 31:22.758
My imagination is really
running away from me.

31:22.841 --> 31:25.135
That's what I was just saying, Emily.

31:25.844 --> 31:29.139
Real love doesn't exist
in your imagination.

31:29.223 --> 31:30.807
It exists right here,

31:31.475 --> 31:35.187
in this abjectly horrible place
we call reality.

31:37.356 --> 31:38.357
Look, there's George.

31:40.692 --> 31:41.693
George, what's going on?

31:43.820 --> 31:45.697
George, are you okay? What's the matter?

31:45.781 --> 31:46.782
It's Frazar.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.409
-Frazar Stearns?
-Yes. Frazar. He--

31:50.452 --> 31:52.579
-He got shot.
-Shot?

31:52.663 --> 31:54.665
In the Battle of New Bern, North Carolina.

31:55.666 --> 31:58.418
Frazar is killed.

32:03.465 --> 32:07.678
I guess I did see the future after all.
