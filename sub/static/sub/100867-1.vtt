44:18.394 --> 44:20.483
- Man, you land
this on me today?

44:20.527 --> 44:21.397
I just told you
I'm trying to get

44:21.441 --> 44:23.791
from underneath of this case.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.794
You talking about, man,
take the case, be cutthroat,

44:26.838 --> 44:29.797
pull up your bootstraps
and now look at us.

44:29.841 --> 44:31.886
Man, what's going to
happen if I lose the case?

44:31.930 --> 44:35.411
What the mayor going
to do, make a speech?

44:45.900 --> 44:47.946
It's still early.

44:47.989 --> 44:49.121
- Thank you, bro.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.254
But y'all no, no, no.

44:53.342 --> 44:55.388
- You can't even worry about.

44:55.431 --> 44:59.697
- I know man, it just be
crazy, y'all swear up and down

45:02.264 --> 45:04.963
that everything
y'all say is true.

45:06.529 --> 45:08.793
Like the gospel
that you believe in.

45:08.836 --> 45:10.664
So called believe in.

45:12.797 --> 45:14.712
[buzzing]

45:17.366 --> 45:18.672
Y'all aint did nothing,

45:18.716 --> 45:20.630
y'all be talking
about them firing me.

45:20.674 --> 45:23.982
Y'all been sorry since
99, since the 90s.

45:24.025 --> 45:26.811
I said, well, if you
google 99 to now,

45:26.854 --> 45:28.595
we got a better record.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.876
- [Attorney] So, officer.

45:48.920 --> 45:52.184
Where you the first
officer on the scene?

45:52.227 --> 45:53.098
- I was not.

45:55.361 --> 46:00.322
- Can you tell us what
you saw when you arrived?

46:00.366 --> 46:03.325
- I got the call, shots fired.

46:03.369 --> 46:04.979
When I arrived on the scene,

46:05.023 --> 46:06.938
the young lady was
standing there crying

46:06.981 --> 46:09.201
with blood all over the place.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.030
- [Attorney] How long have
you been on the force?

46:12.073 --> 46:14.119
- About five years.

46:14.162 --> 46:15.947
- [Attorney] Five years.

46:15.990 --> 46:19.777
So, you are well aware of
the policies of the NMPD

46:22.954 --> 46:23.955
and procedures?

46:23.998 --> 46:25.695
- Yes.

46:25.739 --> 46:30.091
- And on that day, did
you follow those policies

46:30.135 --> 46:32.093
and procedures to the T.

46:32.137 --> 46:32.877
- To the T.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.360
- Did she have a weapon?

46:38.404 --> 46:41.059
- There was a
weapon on the scene.

46:41.102 --> 46:43.278
- What caliber of weapon?

46:43.322 --> 46:43.975
- A 38.

46:46.064 --> 46:49.981
- Was that the same weapon
that was used on the deceased?

46:50.024 --> 46:53.419
- It sure was, same
weapon, same bullets.

46:58.250 --> 47:02.820
- Can you please identify the
woman that you say that day?

47:05.213 --> 47:07.259
- Yes, she's right there.

47:12.481 --> 47:15.745
- Your honor, let
the record reflect

47:15.789 --> 47:19.837
that the officer identified
Ms. Quentika King,

47:19.880 --> 47:20.750
the defendant.

47:22.013 --> 47:25.538
Thank you, your honor,
no further questions.

47:27.496 --> 47:29.194
- Defendant's counsel.

47:30.891 --> 47:35.983
- [Keenan] Detective, is it
your testimony that you were

47:36.027 --> 47:38.072
the first officer on the scene?

47:38.116 --> 47:39.900
- I was.

47:39.944 --> 47:44.035
- And what did you observe
when you approached my client?

47:44.078 --> 47:49.170
- There was blood everywhere,
there was a lot going on.

47:49.214 --> 47:52.304
- Did you see a
weapon in her hand?

47:52.347 --> 47:53.131
- I didn't.

47:55.263 --> 48:00.051
- You don't know if she was
there preforming life saving CPR

48:00.094 --> 48:01.052
on the victim.

48:02.531 --> 48:04.533
- I can't say she was.

48:04.577 --> 48:07.493
- But you can't say she
wasn't either, can you?

48:07.536 --> 48:10.452
- I can't say that either.

48:10.496 --> 48:14.979
- So, you're not sure
who's weapon was there.

48:15.022 --> 48:16.763
[knocking]

48:16.806 --> 48:19.984
- Order in the court, we will
not make this a media frenzy,

48:20.027 --> 48:22.421
do you have questions
for the witness?

48:22.464 --> 48:24.640
- Yes, your honor.

48:24.684 --> 48:26.729
Are you a forensics specialist?

48:26.773 --> 48:28.209
- I am not.

48:28.253 --> 48:30.516
- And do you test
the gun shot residue?

48:30.559 --> 48:31.343
- I do not.

48:32.561 --> 48:35.216
- And my last question,

48:35.260 --> 48:39.525
was the caliber of weapon
used on the victim outside

48:41.092 --> 48:44.573
the same caliber of
weapon used on the victims

48:44.617 --> 48:46.053
inside of the house?

48:46.967 --> 48:49.013
Remember, your under oath

48:51.058 --> 48:52.625
- No.

48:52.668 --> 48:55.193
- Your honor, I call
for immediately mistrial

48:55.236 --> 48:57.499
due to lack of evidence
and no witnesses

48:57.543 --> 49:00.024
to corroborate this
story against my client.

49:00.067 --> 49:01.373
- You're pushing
it, Mr. Robinson.

49:01.416 --> 49:02.896
- This is a mockery of justice.

49:02.940 --> 49:06.247
- We will not turn my
courtroom into a media frenzy

49:06.291 --> 49:07.596
and anymore outbursts like that

49:07.640 --> 49:10.251
will get you a
charge of contempt.

49:15.343 --> 49:16.779
- Do you swear to
tell the whole truth,

49:16.823 --> 49:18.999
nothing but the truth,
so help you God.

49:19.043 --> 49:19.695
- I do.

49:24.396 --> 49:26.920
- Can you please state
your name for the court?

49:26.964 --> 49:28.704
- Quentika King.

49:28.748 --> 49:30.228
- And where are
you from, Ms. King?

49:30.271 --> 49:32.795
- Nashville, Tennessee.

49:32.839 --> 49:34.145
- What is your occupation?

49:34.188 --> 49:36.669
- I'm a beautician.

49:36.712 --> 49:39.367
- Can you tell us
your whereabouts on

49:39.411 --> 49:41.195
the day of July 20th?

49:41.239 --> 49:44.111
- I was out with some friends
catching some Sunday sales

49:44.155 --> 49:46.809
and I had got a phone
call from an old friend

49:46.853 --> 49:50.291
wanting to meet up, saying
that they had some green.

49:50.335 --> 49:51.901
So, I went and met up with them.

49:51.945 --> 49:53.991
When I got there, I
was offered a drink,

49:54.034 --> 49:56.167
next thing I know, I
was tied to a chair

49:56.210 --> 49:57.559
being slapped in the face.

49:57.603 --> 50:01.302
- I understand this is difficult
for you, take your time.

50:01.346 --> 50:03.348
You're in a safe place now.

50:03.391 --> 50:06.568
- And they kept asking me for
money, but I didn't have any.

50:06.612 --> 50:08.570
I gave them my pin
number to my card,

50:08.614 --> 50:10.485
but they just kept hitting me.

50:10.529 --> 50:13.445
I heard shooting and I knew
I had to get up out of there.

50:13.488 --> 50:17.275
That man grabbed me and
tried to take me hostage.

50:17.318 --> 50:20.060
- I just have one more question.

50:20.104 --> 50:23.846
Did you feel as if
your life was in danger

50:23.890 --> 50:26.371
while you where in that room?

50:26.414 --> 50:29.591
- Yes, I thought I was never
going to see my kids again.

50:29.635 --> 50:32.464
[suspenseful music]

50:43.779 --> 50:46.217
- No more questions, your honor.

50:48.958 --> 50:50.917
- Prosecution, your witness.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.788
- Thank you, your honor.

50:54.225 --> 50:57.054
Ms. King or should
I say Queenie,

51:00.318 --> 51:05.758
is it true that you are the
leader of the neighborhood gang

51:05.801 --> 51:07.151
called the Black Roses.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.153
- No ma'am, I'm from
the neighborhood,

51:09.196 --> 51:12.156
but that doesn't define me.

51:12.199 --> 51:14.636
- Okay, so no gang affiliations,

51:16.247 --> 51:18.901
keep in mind you're under oath.

51:22.253 --> 51:23.906
- No ma'am.

51:23.950 --> 51:26.170
- Objection, your honor.

51:26.213 --> 51:28.694
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

51:28.737 --> 51:33.220
This is a picture of the
tattoo that she has on her arm

51:33.264 --> 51:36.484
when she was booked
last year for assault.

51:36.528 --> 51:37.703
- [Keenan] Objection,
your honor.

51:37.746 --> 51:40.053
Counsel is testifying
for the witness.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.751
- [Judge] Overruled,
I'll allow it.

51:42.795 --> 51:45.232
Please answer the
question, Ms. King.

51:45.276 --> 51:48.757
- Yes, it's a picture of a rose

51:48.801 --> 51:52.109
which represents the power
and the struggle of my people,

51:52.152 --> 51:54.241
but it's more of a lifestyle.

51:57.723 --> 52:02.206
- Your honor, can you
please instruct the witness

52:02.249 --> 52:04.773
to answer the
questions yes or no.

52:04.817 --> 52:07.167
This is not a history lesson.

52:07.211 --> 52:10.779
- Madam witness, please answer
the questions yes or no.

52:10.823 --> 52:12.433
- Thank you, your honor.

52:12.477 --> 52:16.263
- Is it not true that you
are convicted of biting off

52:16.307 --> 52:22.182
a rival gang member's ear just
two years prior to this case?

52:22.226 --> 52:23.444
- I was being jumped
and where I'm from,

52:23.488 --> 52:26.186
there's not such
thing as a fair fight.

52:26.230 --> 52:28.928
- By any means necessary, right.

52:28.971 --> 52:31.539
On that bloody Sunday when
we found you standing over

52:31.583 --> 52:35.630
dead mob lieutenant's body,
was that a fair fight.

52:37.502 --> 52:40.592
- I was only there to get
some drugs for my habit.

52:40.635 --> 52:42.637
One of the guys hit
me and tied me up.

52:42.681 --> 52:43.856
They drugged me.

52:43.899 --> 52:45.466
What am I supposed to do?

52:45.510 --> 52:47.512
- Can someone please give
me some tissue and cheese

52:47.555 --> 52:49.078
for that whine?

52:49.122 --> 52:50.863
- [Keenan] Objection,
badgering the witness.

52:50.906 --> 52:53.953
My client is clearly
distraught and upset.

52:53.996 --> 52:55.302
- [Judge] Sustained.

52:55.346 --> 52:56.825
- You don't know what
it's like to be a woman

52:56.869 --> 52:59.132
in this lifestyle.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.568
Men always want they want

53:00.612 --> 53:03.310
and try to take what
they can't have.

53:03.354 --> 53:07.619
If you're not strong
enough, I just fought back.

53:07.662 --> 53:10.274
- And what lifestyle is that?

53:10.317 --> 53:12.363
The one you're not
affiliated with?

53:12.406 --> 53:14.626
- I went in to get
some green like I said.

53:14.669 --> 53:17.368
One of them offered me
something to drink and I took it

53:17.411 --> 53:20.066
because I was thirsty,
it was a hot day.

53:20.109 --> 53:22.938
Like a minute later, I
remember feeling lightheaded,

53:22.982 --> 53:25.332
then boom, I hit the floor.

53:25.376 --> 53:27.465
And when I woke up, I
was tied to a chair,

53:27.508 --> 53:29.554
being slapped in
the face, punched

53:29.597 --> 53:32.209
and them asking
where's the money?

53:33.906 --> 53:37.910
I panicked and when I ran,
that's when I seen the police.

53:37.953 --> 53:39.346
They ran upon me.

53:40.782 --> 53:45.004
I've been in jail for six
months away from my kids

53:45.047 --> 53:46.353
and I'm the victim.

53:49.095 --> 53:51.576
- So, you're the victim, right?

53:51.619 --> 53:54.274
No further questions your honor.

54:16.253 --> 54:20.300
The state seeks the
maximum sentence.

54:20.344 --> 54:23.303
We as good, hard
working Americans

54:25.436 --> 54:28.308
want to feel safe
in our communities

54:29.570 --> 54:34.488
and not feel boxed in by
the filth and the scum

54:34.532 --> 54:37.317
that wants to murder, steal

54:37.361 --> 54:39.885
and peddle drugs
to our children.

54:42.453 --> 54:45.369
It is your job to
administer justice

54:46.761 --> 54:48.372
and justice is blind.

54:51.549 --> 54:55.596
Don't look at the fact
that she's a mother

54:55.640 --> 54:58.382
or has had a hard
life in the past.

55:00.079 --> 55:03.387
No, look at the evidence
and were it leads.

55:05.345 --> 55:08.130
And that evidence
points to guilty.

55:26.932 --> 55:30.327
- They will have you
believe that my client

55:31.589 --> 55:34.896
single handedly, by
herself, with no help,

55:38.944 --> 55:42.948
took out two high
ranking gang members

55:42.991 --> 55:45.516
and the mob lieutenant.

55:45.559 --> 55:48.345
After she was brutally
beaten, drugged

55:50.521 --> 55:52.305
and tied to a chair.

55:53.524 --> 55:57.223
That doesn't even
sound reasonable to me.

55:57.266 --> 56:01.445
So, we raise the fact
of reasonable doubt,

56:01.488 --> 56:02.837
you must acquit.

56:04.491 --> 56:09.888
Now, the prosecution will
say that she's a gang member

56:09.931 --> 56:12.717
because she has a tattoo.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.459
That couldn't be
further from the truth.

56:15.502 --> 56:17.504
My client is a law
abiding citizen.

56:17.548 --> 56:20.899
It is your job to protect them.

56:20.942 --> 56:23.162
And ask yourself a question.

56:23.205 --> 56:27.558
Has the state made you believe
that my client is guilty

56:27.601 --> 56:29.647
beyond a reasonable doubt?

56:32.040 --> 56:35.740
If you can't answer that
question 100 percent,

56:37.089 --> 56:40.222
then you need to find
my client not guilty.

56:40.266 --> 56:43.182
She is the victim here and
she deserves to go back home

56:43.225 --> 56:45.402
with her family who love her.

56:48.143 --> 56:50.058
Your conscious is
pulling you right now

56:50.102 --> 56:51.886
in the right direction.

56:53.584 --> 56:58.763
Find my client not guilty and
send her home with her family.

56:58.806 --> 56:59.416
Thank you.

57:12.167 --> 57:15.606
Hey Danny man, you think they
buying our song and dance?

57:15.649 --> 57:18.783
- All it takes is
just one and done.

57:18.826 --> 57:21.046
- Yeah man, and look, she
doing all that emotional stuff

57:21.089 --> 57:22.395
and crying on the stand.

57:22.439 --> 57:25.529
She might just pull it off, man.

57:25.572 --> 57:27.531
- Either way, we screwed.

57:27.574 --> 57:29.707
If she gets off, the
mayor's pissed off

57:29.750 --> 57:32.884
and she done
threatened your family.

57:32.927 --> 57:34.276
We might just end up
putting you off in the

57:34.320 --> 57:36.322
witness protection program.

57:36.365 --> 57:37.628
And not to mention the mafia

57:37.671 --> 57:39.543
that got you looking
over you shoulder.

57:39.586 --> 57:41.806
At least you'll make partner.

57:41.849 --> 57:44.069
[laughing]

57:51.032 --> 57:53.513
- You paid the juror, right?
