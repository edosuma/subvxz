00:01.450 --> 00:02.950
<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:02.960 --> 00:04.486
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:04.510 --> 00:06.510
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.</i>

00:06.590 --> 00:09.520
<i>I cut off the points of my ears
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:09.530 --> 00:11.640
<i>A tiny creature lives inside me,</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.520
<i>passed to me by my dying mother.</i>

00:13.600 --> 00:16.820
<i>It gives me the power to open
portals to another world</i>

00:16.890 --> 00:19.070
<i>and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.</i>

00:19.150 --> 00:21.240
<i>But I can only summon them
when I have their names,</i>

00:21.250 --> 00:23.410
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:23.420 --> 00:26.420
<i>The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:26.500 --> 00:29.790
<i>at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:32.369
<i>Previously on "The Outpost"...</i>

00:32.450 --> 00:34.040
- Guards!
- You need an army

00:34.050 --> 00:37.050
to defend yourself
against the Prime Order.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.260
- Your word you'll free my family.
- You have my word.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.590
Are you promising
to free our kindred?

00:41.670 --> 00:44.220
- Zed may have answers. He can help.
- Another Blackblood?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.760
If you intend to be the One
and control the Asterkinj,

00:45.770 --> 00:47.480
- you need me.
- Then stay here.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.270
She's a false queen
and you are just her puppet.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.276
- I'm celebrating our engagement.
- I'm not desperate enough

00:53.300 --> 00:56.070
<i>to marry you.</i>

00:56.150 --> 00:58.270
<i>By the end of the week,</i>

00:58.290 --> 01:00.030
Garret Spears will be
yours to command.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.280
This key unlocks a great power

01:02.290 --> 01:04.620
that could solve the problems
of our people and your Queen.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.740
You will return to The Outpost.

01:06.820 --> 01:08.540
You will kill the Blackblood.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.250
You will kidnap the False Queen.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.010
My purpose is clear.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
He's not hard to look at, is he?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.950
Pity that's all he's good for.

01:50.030 --> 01:54.510
His men seem to like him.
Perhaps he's more than he appears.

01:54.580 --> 01:57.460
Maybe when he's not drunk
and acting like a pig.

01:57.540 --> 02:01.630
You know, he runs one of the most
prosperous districts in the Realm.

02:01.710 --> 02:04.630
Your sister,
his Advising Counsel,

02:04.710 --> 02:06.106
runs one of the most
prosperous districts

02:06.130 --> 02:07.840
- in the Realm.
- Yeah, well, trust me,

02:07.860 --> 02:09.186
she's not doing that
all on her own,

02:09.210 --> 02:11.350
even if she pretends she is.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.020
You sure you don't like him?

02:13.030 --> 02:16.600
Like him? No.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.416
Well, I don't know
what my sister said to him,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.270
but he must be doing
something right.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.440
Yes, he has tried the stick,
now he's trying honey.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.040
Only I'm not a dog.

02:24.110 --> 02:27.790
That's my girl.

02:27.870 --> 02:32.540
Still, it's nice having
him around, isn't it?

02:32.550 --> 02:36.370
Our army is still too small
even with his men.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.630
Perhaps I shall need
to attract more suitors.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.140
You two would make
beautiful babies.

02:43.410 --> 02:46.840
Alrighty, I shall leave you then

02:46.920 --> 02:49.600
to reflect on
your royal obligations.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.230
Beautiful babies.

03:03.390 --> 03:06.240
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

03:06.250 --> 03:08.490
When I could trust you,

03:08.560 --> 03:11.080
which obviously I can't.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.590
You know, I let you stay here,

03:13.660 --> 03:15.380
and you repay me
by going through my things?

03:15.450 --> 03:17.920
You lied to me!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.620
Look, you don't understand
how important this is!

03:19.640 --> 03:21.760
No, I don't,
because you haven't told me.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.090
I told you, it's a key!

03:23.160 --> 03:25.710
Yeah, a key to great power.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.720
- What is that supposed mean?
- I don't know.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.260
Hopefully it's some power that
can help us save our people.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.510
- What, like a weapon?
- Maybe. Your books don't say,

03:32.590 --> 03:33.930
and the stories I remember
from being a kid

03:33.940 --> 03:36.110
were about some stone wall
and the stars.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.270
How do you even know
these stories are real?

03:38.280 --> 03:40.450
Well, there's obviously
some truth to them,

03:40.520 --> 03:41.860
because you have the key.

03:41.940 --> 03:43.440
Just tell me
where the rest of it is.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.820
- What are you talking about?
- The key.

03:45.830 --> 03:48.150
- Where is the rest of the key?
- That is it.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.200
No, it isn't. Look.

03:52.210 --> 03:56.290
In the middle,
there's a stone and it's missing.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.310
That's all the Dragman gave me.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.540
All right, let's have a look.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.910
Gods above.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.780
Whose is this?

04:34.860 --> 04:36.670
All our animals were attacked.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.550
Been finding them all week,
even this morning.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.080
Oh, Your Majesty.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.510
What brings you out here
on this not so very fine day?

04:47.590 --> 04:51.260
Looking for you. Hmm?

04:51.330 --> 04:54.520
I received word that the miners
are already talking about striking.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.906
You said you paid them
fair wages.

04:55.930 --> 04:57.640
I have.

04:57.650 --> 04:59.406
They're just pushing
their boundaries, that's all.

04:59.430 --> 05:01.640
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.860
Elinor, what seems
to be troubling these folk?

05:04.940 --> 05:09.030
Well, it seems that Talon's
not obeying her orders.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.540
- How so?
- Have a look.

05:18.690 --> 05:20.450
What did this?

05:20.530 --> 05:22.050
Lu-Qiri demon.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.926
It's the only creature
that could've done that.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.880
And we're worried
it will be our children next.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.550
You have my word this creature
will be dealt with.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.510
Elinor, take care
of these people.

05:30.580 --> 05:34.890
Pay them each for what they
have lost out of the treasury.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.930
And straighten out that
situation with the miners.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.650
- Foreman.
- Hmm.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.190
How lovely to finally
meet with you.

05:48.270 --> 05:49.690
Could have shown me the courtesy

05:49.770 --> 05:51.570
of sharing a pint
at the Nightshade.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.440
But you got no respect
for working men,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.360
which is why me and the boys

05:55.440 --> 05:56.920
- have been talking.
- Yeah?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.750
You and the boys been talking?

05:58.830 --> 06:00.160
What have you been
talking about?

06:00.170 --> 06:01.740
Well, let's start with the pay.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.750
Three coppers a day
is not fit for a pig feeder,

06:04.760 --> 06:06.260
and here we are risking
life and limb.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.890
Can I offer you some, Foreman?

06:12.620 --> 06:14.560
Don't mind if I do.

06:17.130 --> 06:21.100
What would it take to make
everything right again?

06:21.110 --> 06:25.110
30 gold beads to me is all,
and I'll make it go away.

06:27.810 --> 06:31.860
Sounds like you and I
have got a lot to discuss.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.450
Come into my office.

06:43.130 --> 06:45.910
Come on, come on.

06:51.550 --> 06:54.430
I'll do what I can about
work conditions, Foreman.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.940
But corruption in the
workplace, we just can't abide.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.330
Leave this place,
or I swear I'll call on my Lu-Qiri.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.670
Call your demon,
and I swear to you,

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
I will set every man
in this Outpost on him

07:36.760 --> 07:39.430
and cut him down
like a diseased dog.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.190
Take him!

07:41.260 --> 07:43.230
And find me Talon.

07:55.940 --> 07:56.940
What are you doing?

07:57.020 --> 07:59.700
You lied to me.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.820
Your Blackblood
and his demon were banished

08:01.900 --> 08:03.660
- by my royal decree.
- It's not that simple.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.660
I trusted you
to do what I asked.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.370
And Zed is not some creature
you can command,

08:07.380 --> 08:08.370
and neither am I.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.050
His demon is killing livestock,

08:11.130 --> 08:13.330
and Zed deliberately
disobeyed a royal decree!

08:13.410 --> 08:15.340
Both are punishable
by imprisonment or death.

08:15.410 --> 08:18.050
Zed is the only reason
you are alive.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.630
If it wasn't for him,
you would be dead.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.840
Yes, yes, he saved me
from a demon...

08:21.920 --> 08:23.340
using another demon.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.010
Clearly, I wouldn't need saving

08:25.090 --> 08:26.980
if you Blackbloods just
stayed where you belong.

08:32.110 --> 08:35.950
So, tell me, Gwynn,
where do we belong?

08:38.309 --> 08:41.080
That's not what I meant.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.416
You're the one who wanted a
demon army in the first place.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.070
Yes, and I was wrong.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.580
It was a mistake.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.660
A horrible mistake.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.090
So what are you going
to do with him?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.760
He can't leave my prison.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.840
- And his demon must be eliminated.
- No.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.750
He can control it.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.260
It can stay with him,
away from the people.

08:59.270 --> 09:02.010
Clearly he cannot.
It's out there right now

09:02.080 --> 09:04.270
roaming and killing
as it pleases,

09:04.350 --> 09:07.940
wagons full of livestock dead.

09:08.020 --> 09:11.520
Any moment now,
I expect to hear that he's killing people

09:11.590 --> 09:14.030
like your demon did.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.860
I need to keep my people safe.

09:18.930 --> 09:21.440
If he sends Vikka back,

09:21.450 --> 09:22.850
will you release him
free and clear?

09:25.270 --> 09:26.700
I'll make you an oath.

09:26.780 --> 09:29.290
If you rid of that demon
for good,

09:29.300 --> 09:30.910
then I will pardon Zed
of his offenses.

09:30.990 --> 09:34.290
Fine.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.460
Zed can go back with his demon.

09:36.470 --> 09:38.960
No, I need him.

09:38.970 --> 09:41.140
- Why?
- He's teaching me about my history,

09:41.220 --> 09:43.920
my people, and the prophecy.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.550
I'm sorry.

09:45.630 --> 09:47.550
I just...

09:47.630 --> 09:49.310
I don't trust him.

09:49.390 --> 09:53.810
He must return
from whence he came.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.780
Then we'll just leave
the demon out there killing.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.950
You wouldn't.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.940
Try me.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.450
If Zed does anything wrong,
I'll banish him myself.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.670
You have my word.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.176
Any more demons without my permission,
and I will banish you both.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.670
- Fine.
- Deal.

10:16.370 --> 10:20.350
Her Majesty Queen Rosmund
cares deeply,

10:20.420 --> 10:24.720
very deeply about
all of you ugly dogs.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.680
The upper mine
is working full bore,

10:26.760 --> 10:29.180
and she's now opened
the lower mine,

10:29.190 --> 10:32.310
and she's looking
for hard-working men

10:32.380 --> 10:33.930
such as yourselves.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.640
You'll have coin in your pocket,

10:35.720 --> 10:37.360
you'll have food in your belly,

10:37.440 --> 10:39.110
and you'll have
a swagger in your step,

10:39.190 --> 10:41.870
and don't you think
that us ladies won't notice.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.950
So, step up, make your mark.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.710
Long live the Queen!

10:52.880 --> 10:55.200
I can't see
how this helps us, Mum,

10:55.220 --> 10:56.960
us paying all these miners.

10:57.030 --> 10:58.670
Queen's Treasury
is paying for it.

10:58.740 --> 10:59.976
Yeah, but it's your money,
ain't it?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.390
Oh, Munt, my lovely idiot boy,

11:03.460 --> 11:05.560
I'm just lending
the Queen the money.

11:05.630 --> 11:07.300
The time's gonna come

11:07.380 --> 11:09.890
when I'm gonna get it
all back and then some.

11:16.150 --> 11:18.030
Excuse me.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.150
You know, the Queen's
army would be better off

11:28.230 --> 11:31.530
fighting the Prime Order
with a pointy stick!

11:31.540 --> 11:33.160
Apologies, Mistress.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.250
Don't you call me that!

11:36.330 --> 11:39.960
I'm Counselor to the Queen.
I'm Treasurer to the Realm.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.250
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?

11:41.260 --> 11:43.040
Yes, ma'am. Yes, um...

11:43.120 --> 11:45.090
- What are you calling me?
- Your counselor-ship.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.670
- Madam Treasurer.
- Yes? Yes, all right.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.600
Shut up. Get back to work.
No more cutting corners.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.486
You make this like you have
to fight with it yourself.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.610
I will not pay for shoddy work.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.320
Munt, get over here.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.860
You were making
a good point, Munt.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.110
- I did?
- Yeah.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.860
You were saying that we can't
bankroll this whole racket ourselves.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.950
- I was?
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.290
And that the queen needs
some kind of steady revenue

12:16.300 --> 12:18.290
so that she can pay us back.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.870
That's precisely
what I'm meaning.

12:19.950 --> 12:23.380
Yeah, of course you were,
Munt, in so many words.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.880
And since it was your idea,
who better to pull it off?

12:25.960 --> 12:31.310
So, I'm gonna make you
tax collector to the Realm.

12:41.140 --> 12:43.310
You all right?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.820
Oh, I've missed bread.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.820
There's nothing to eat
but Graylock on the other side.

12:47.830 --> 12:51.650
Listen,
Gwynn you offered a deal.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.910
We send Vikka back
and you're free to go.

12:53.980 --> 12:55.910
No. I can't send Vikka back.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.950
Well, it's either that
or you rot in here forever.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.420
I left you the whistle.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.010
Use it to call Vikka
and break me out.

13:05.090 --> 13:07.350
- I won't do that.
- Why not?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.236
Are you really gonna side with
humans over your own kind?

13:09.260 --> 13:11.010
Look, I am trying
to save Vikka's life.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.190
If he breaks you out,
or even if he doesn't,

13:14.260 --> 13:15.816
men will hunt him down
and eventually kill him.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.010
You see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.520
They'd kill
an innocent creature.

13:19.530 --> 13:20.916
Not if we make a deal
with the Queen.

13:20.940 --> 13:24.690
She'll let me
send him back safely.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.360
Do you trust this queen
more than you trust me?

13:26.370 --> 13:28.320
Yeah, I do.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.440
Unbelievable.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.720
- Well, I'll never trust her.
- Well, you don't have to.

13:33.780 --> 13:37.620
Look, just trust me.
I want to save Vikka.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.330
But right now,
the only place he's safe

13:39.400 --> 13:40.200
is on the other side
of the portal.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.960
Then send us both back.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.386
That's what you really want,
isn't it?

13:44.410 --> 13:47.510
You're right. I'd love that.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.776
But if I send you back,
who is going to help me use the key

13:53.800 --> 13:56.140
to unlock the power
to free our people?

13:59.970 --> 14:01.890
Is that what you want?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.730
My mother had the power
to bring the Blackbloods home,

14:04.740 --> 14:07.570
but she didn't,
and I don't know why.

14:07.650 --> 14:09.660
I need you
to help me understand.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.860
Well, I suppose trust
has to go both ways.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.500
Yeah, it does.

15:15.670 --> 15:17.640
E-ja halo, Vikka.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.420
E-ja!

15:25.300 --> 15:28.240
E-ja!

15:39.820 --> 15:40.870
I'm sorry.

15:42.410 --> 15:45.340
I know what he means to you.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.370
We've been together longer
than you've been alive.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.880
You'll be with him again.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.690
I did what she asked.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.680
Good.

16:06.690 --> 16:09.010
Then I know where we can find
the missing piece to the key.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.540
Hi.

16:30.530 --> 16:32.500
Talon.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.210
Hi. I'll be...
Ow! What was that for?

16:35.220 --> 16:36.550
You don't want her
to see we're together.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
That's not true.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.820
- We're together.
- That's great, Janzo.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.410
You two are perfect
for each other.

16:58.730 --> 17:01.030
- You're not angry?
- Why would I be?

17:01.110 --> 17:02.710
- Jealous?
- Not even a little.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.700
- Good.
- Now that that's sorted,

17:05.780 --> 17:08.420
I need a flask
of your special drink,

17:08.500 --> 17:09.819
the one that sharpens
your senses.

17:12.619 --> 17:15.040
Should I be worried?
What's going on?

17:15.119 --> 17:17.339
I'm just going out
of town for a while.

17:17.410 --> 17:19.380
Oh, right.
Well, I'll just, um,

17:19.460 --> 17:20.896
clean up shop here,
and then I'll get my stuff.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.089
I mean, timing's not perfect...

17:23.170 --> 17:24.380
Janzo, not this time.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.839
Why not?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.550
You have important
things to do here.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.110
You have to find a cure
for the Plaguelings,

17:30.180 --> 17:32.166
and Gwynn needs at least
one person she can count on.

17:32.190 --> 17:35.030
Except I don't exactly
have the queen's ear, do I?

17:38.030 --> 17:39.870
Don't you?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.030
How long will you be gone away?

17:44.110 --> 17:45.620
No idea.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.570
You have a good thing
going here.

17:47.650 --> 17:48.970
Try not to blow it
while I'm gone.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.220
Bye.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.930
Bye.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.360
Leave us.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.980
The Queen has summoned you.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.600
Well, I am busy right now.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.400
Busy making a fool of yourself!

18:19.470 --> 18:20.730
We had a deal, Tobin.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.580
It's one drink!

18:22.650 --> 18:24.160
Is that one drink
worth more to you

18:24.240 --> 18:27.110
than making your son a king?

18:27.190 --> 18:28.580
I saw how she was looking at you

18:28.660 --> 18:30.240
when you were working
outside the wall.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.120
You might actually have a chance

18:32.200 --> 18:33.750
if she saw you
as anything but a drunk.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.340
Why should I care
what she thinks?

18:35.420 --> 18:37.330
- I've given her everything.
- Why?

18:37.340 --> 18:38.590
Because she's worth it, Tobin.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.420
Janzo!

18:45.500 --> 18:47.340
- Yes, Aunt Gertie?
- I gave you instructions.

18:47.350 --> 18:50.390
- No more drink.
- Sorry, he's just way bigger than I am.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.850
He has an audience
with the queen.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.656
Don't worry,
I'm going to make a special tonic

18:55.680 --> 18:58.100
that'll sober up
his big old head.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.110
What am I missing, Jazzo?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.706
My name's Janzo,
that's what you're missing.

19:01.730 --> 19:05.860
About the queen.
Why does she hate me?

19:05.870 --> 19:08.200
She's not just going to open
up her heart to you, Tobin.

19:08.210 --> 19:11.030
I mean, the lady just lost
the love of her life.

19:11.110 --> 19:14.210
Soldiers aren't
the only ones who wear armor.

19:14.290 --> 19:17.080
- Who was it?
- Garret.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.880
- The base commander?
- Mm.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.590
You mean, they were...

19:22.600 --> 19:24.840
I gonna go and make you
that tonic now.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.880
- Great speed, nephew.
- Before you go, one last thing.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.970
What was so special
about this... this Garret?

19:33.050 --> 19:36.530
He had a good heart
and a sense of duty.

19:39.350 --> 19:40.360
Good luck finding that.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.710
- Ah, Master Tobin.
- Your Majesty.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.420
I'm so pleased you've decided
to give me another chance.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.670
Yes, well, don't read
into the gesture.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.266
It's simply that I saw
your hard work today

20:01.290 --> 20:03.710
and I appreciated it.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.226
Yes, well,
I made a promise I'd work for you,

20:05.250 --> 20:08.260
and I intend to keep it.

20:08.270 --> 20:11.050
Which is why you deserve

20:11.130 --> 20:12.226
to be treated with more respect

20:12.250 --> 20:15.180
than I have shown thus far.

20:15.260 --> 20:17.690
Well, I appreciate
your kindness, Your Majesty.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.190
I opened the late General
Calkussar's wine cellar.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.860
I sent for a particularly
fine vintage,

20:30.940 --> 20:32.450
which I'm sure you'll enjoy.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.370
Thank you, um, but none for me.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.200
Baron?

20:38.280 --> 20:40.160
Since when do you turn
down good wine?

20:40.170 --> 20:41.970
Since I met you.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.630
Could've fooled me.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.470
Since this morning,

20:45.550 --> 20:47.050
I no longer partake
in the drink.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.670
Well, you are full of surprises.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.430
In that case, Naya,
I too shall abstain.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.640
Clearly, I need to keep
my wits about me.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.640
This could be a trick
to gain the upper hand.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.640
There's nothing sinister here,
Your Majesty.

20:59.650 --> 21:02.390
I'm just trying
to be a better man,

21:02.470 --> 21:04.060
and Gertrusha talked me into it.

21:04.140 --> 21:05.940
Treasure that nagging voice.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.270
You'll miss it when it's gone.

21:07.290 --> 21:09.070
Was old Calkussar a nag, too?

21:09.140 --> 21:10.706
He and my father were
good friends, you know.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.150
He certainly liked
a good drink now and then.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.830
Yes, he did, but, um...

21:15.910 --> 21:19.500
no, I was actually
thinking of someone else.

21:19.580 --> 21:23.290
I don't intend to pry, but I...

21:23.370 --> 21:25.290
I heard you
lost someone recently.

21:25.370 --> 21:26.920
Your commander.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.340
Garret, yes.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.680
Were you close?

21:29.760 --> 21:32.760
Were.

21:32.830 --> 21:35.760
We were friends since
we were children, actually.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.020
More than friends?

21:42.510 --> 21:46.270
Then I am very sorry
for your loss.

21:46.350 --> 21:47.520
Let's drink to Garret,

21:47.530 --> 21:49.780
with this lovely,
refreshing goblet

21:49.850 --> 21:52.750
of water.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.110
He would have approved.

21:56.190 --> 22:00.620
To Garret,
who died fighting the Prime Order.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.630
A true hero of the Outpost.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.000
Why did you come
to my aid, Tobin?

22:09.080 --> 22:12.210
I can't decide if it was incredibly
brave or incredibly foolish.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.470
I had to do it.

22:14.540 --> 22:17.340
You're our only chance for a
world without a Prime Order.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.560
And why does that matter to you,

22:19.640 --> 22:21.390
a rich nobleman who lost
nothing in the overthrow?

22:21.400 --> 22:24.850
- Lost nothing?
- You kept your palaces,

22:24.930 --> 22:26.740
your land, your servants.

22:29.650 --> 22:31.360
After your family were beheaded,

22:31.440 --> 22:33.110
the Prime Order stopped
at our stronghold

22:33.120 --> 22:34.570
to demand allegiance.

22:34.580 --> 22:37.070
I was only eight,

22:37.080 --> 22:39.250
but I watched
as my father bent the knee

22:39.330 --> 22:42.380
and pledged his loyalty
to those bastards.

22:43.950 --> 22:45.420
And still they...

22:48.170 --> 22:52.050
They still killed my sister
in front of everyone,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.720
just to remind him
of whose boots he was licking.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.050
I'm sorry.

22:58.130 --> 23:00.680
Yeah, well, he should've fought,

23:00.760 --> 23:02.980
but he was too afraid.

23:03.060 --> 23:04.560
He was too scared
to lose it all...

23:04.630 --> 23:09.110
His possessions,
his privilege, his legacy.

23:09.190 --> 23:11.940
And in the end,
he lost so much more.

23:11.950 --> 23:14.070
I don't intend to make the
same mistakes as my father.

23:14.110 --> 23:15.440
I intend to fight.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.706
For revenge against
the Prime Order?

23:16.730 --> 23:18.700
No.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.130
To put an honest
and compassionate leader

23:21.200 --> 23:23.700
in their place.

23:23.780 --> 23:25.000
That will be my legacy.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.340
Good legacy.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.470
I understand it was a traitor

23:40.480 --> 23:42.760
- who gave Garret up.
- Yes.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.860
- You hanged him, I presume?
- We never caught him.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.930
Wythers was investigating,

23:47.010 --> 23:49.440
but now there's no word
from him either.

23:49.510 --> 23:52.320
So there's still
a traitor in our midst?

23:52.400 --> 23:54.490
I'll get on the case
and we'll hang the bastard.

23:54.570 --> 23:57.200
I'm so sorry.

24:36.370 --> 24:39.190
Elinor, that really
doesn't suit you.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.950
Standing behind a bar is much
more flattering to a woman

24:42.020 --> 24:45.120
- of your figure.
- I do love our little chats, Gertie.

24:45.190 --> 24:47.920
Come and sit over here
where I can look down on you.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.720
You know, a friend sent me
a message from the Capital.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.010
- Your colipsum distributor?
- A friend caught word

25:00.080 --> 25:03.060
that the Prime Order
are putting in motion

25:03.140 --> 25:06.560
plans to attack
and destroy the Queen

25:06.640 --> 25:08.600
and everyone around her.

25:08.610 --> 25:10.900
- What is this plan?
- That's all he's got.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.310
Best guess is they're combining
regiments to form a massive army,

25:14.390 --> 25:15.400
and they're attacking
really soon.

25:15.410 --> 25:18.080
We need to accelerate now.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.576
Then you need to get your
queen to accept her only hope

25:19.600 --> 25:22.740
- of victory.
- What, marry Tobin?

25:22.750 --> 25:24.820
You and I both know,
if she did marries that idiot,

25:24.900 --> 25:26.490
it's not gonna help.

25:26.570 --> 25:29.090
Between your armies
and mine, we are no match

25:29.160 --> 25:32.080
for combined regiments
of the Prime Order.

25:32.090 --> 25:34.330
Yes, you're probably right.

25:34.410 --> 25:35.880
Any word from the other nobles?

25:35.950 --> 25:37.590
Nope, not a one.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.840
No, I didn't think
there would be.

25:39.910 --> 25:43.300
However,
if a union between Tobin

25:43.380 --> 25:46.390
and the queen were announced,
others would come.

25:46.460 --> 25:48.220
Until then,
they'll hide in the shadows.

25:48.300 --> 25:49.850
They're too afraid
of the Prime Order

25:49.920 --> 25:51.890
to be the first
to join the queen.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.520
What are you saying?

25:53.600 --> 25:57.990
I provide an ally,
you provide a marriage.

26:00.770 --> 26:02.450
Have you got anyone in mind?

26:02.530 --> 26:06.200
Tobin has a cousin,
Milus Aegisford.

26:06.270 --> 26:09.700
He has men and lands
to rival Tobin's.

26:09.780 --> 26:12.630
His men combined
with mine and yours

26:12.710 --> 26:14.120
would make a formidable force.

26:14.130 --> 26:16.790
How loyal is he
to the Prime Order?

26:16.800 --> 26:19.800
Covenant soldiers sacked his
grain towers in the famine winter.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.710
His people nearly
starved to death.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.810
He is no friend
to the Prime Order.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.260
- He sounds perfect.
- Except for one thing.

26:26.340 --> 26:29.350
The last time they met,
Tobin cut Milus wide open.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.900
- Ooh.
- And that's about as friendly

26:30.970 --> 26:32.106
as the feud between
them has ever been.

26:32.130 --> 26:35.650
Well, sounds like Tobin

26:35.730 --> 26:37.100
needs to prove his strength

26:37.180 --> 26:38.730
in the only way that counts...

26:38.810 --> 26:41.120
On his knees.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.620
Why're we doing this, Janzo?

26:52.700 --> 26:53.966
I've got more
important work to do.

26:53.990 --> 26:55.580
What could be more important

26:55.660 --> 26:57.306
than figuring out how
to cure a Plagueling, Munt?

26:57.330 --> 26:59.670
Like figuring out
how to tax 'em.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.420
But the only way to do that
is to cure them.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.630
You see,
you can't tax a Plagueling,

27:04.710 --> 27:08.470
- but you can tax a human.
- You sure about that?

27:08.550 --> 27:11.180
Never been more sure about
something in my entire life.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.660
That's it.
Right. Oh, okay.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.370
Have you ever wondered
why Plaguelings

27:28.450 --> 27:30.030
only come out at night, Munt?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.200
It's more scary at night.

27:31.210 --> 27:33.990
True, but insignificant.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.450
Plaguelings avoid the sunlight,
is what I was getting at.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.880
And that, my dear friend,
could be a clue for the cure.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.010
A clue for the cure.

27:42.130 --> 27:43.600
Okay.

27:43.670 --> 27:46.640
Okay.

27:52.550 --> 27:54.220
- Now what?
- Chain up the rest.

27:54.230 --> 27:55.980
Go on.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.150
You don't need any help, do you?

28:02.220 --> 28:05.900
Yeah, it'd be nice to have
a little help over here.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.780
Shame Brogan's not around.

28:07.850 --> 28:08.860
Yeah.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.250
Here we go.

28:12.110 --> 28:15.080
Munt, have you ever
had a girlfriend?

28:15.090 --> 28:16.160
Nah.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.080
Nah, Mum told me not to.

28:18.090 --> 28:20.420
Said they'll take advantage
of my sweet nature.

28:20.430 --> 28:22.590
Strange.
She never said that to me.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.386
Yeah, she said you'd
never have a girlfriend.

28:24.410 --> 28:26.920
- What?
- Yeah, she said,

28:26.930 --> 28:28.210
"It'd be a cold day in hell

28:28.290 --> 28:29.670
before Janzo
has a girlfriend."

28:29.750 --> 28:31.340
Okay, that's enough, Munt.
Thank you.

28:31.350 --> 28:32.470
"There's not one single girl

28:32.500 --> 28:33.646
in all the Outpost for Janzo."

28:33.670 --> 28:35.720
Quite the comedian today,
aren't we?

28:35.800 --> 28:38.440
- "We'd have to send to the Capital for..."
- Munt, that's enough!

28:39.280 --> 28:43.560
Why are you asking?
'Cause you like Naya?

28:43.640 --> 28:47.480
- Is it that obvious?
- Yeah.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.450
It's, um... it's all a bit
of a dream, really.

28:50.530 --> 28:52.360
It's like whenever
she looks at me,

28:52.440 --> 28:54.120
there's no one else
in the entire world.

28:54.130 --> 28:55.790
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

28:55.870 --> 28:59.830
Yeah, I know what
that's like. Yeah.

28:59.910 --> 29:01.960
No, actually, no, I don't...
I don't know what that's like.

29:01.970 --> 29:05.140
Shame. Maybe one day
you'll get there.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.680
I could give you some tips.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.010
Now what?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.380
Now we let the sun do its magic.

29:10.460 --> 29:11.930
Ah.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.770
Excuse me, miss.
Letters for her Majesty.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.770
Ah, yes. Thank you.
I'll take them.

29:23.780 --> 29:29.400
Oh, this last one
is addressed to you.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.330
Oh, yes. Thank you.

30:14.450 --> 30:16.910
Baron, what can I do for you?

30:16.920 --> 30:18.880
Do you keep a record
of every message

30:18.950 --> 30:20.806
- coming in and out of this Outpost?
- Yes, sir.

30:20.830 --> 30:23.920
Marshal Wythers
had me keep a log.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.390
- Anything unusual in here?
- No, sir.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.980
I'll get on the case
and we'll hang the bastard.

30:38.060 --> 30:39.940
I'm so sorry.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.526
Do you ever read
anyone's messages?

30:45.550 --> 30:46.940
Never, sir.

30:46.950 --> 30:48.520
Everything is delivered sealed.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.900
And this bird for Naya,
where did it come from?

30:50.910 --> 30:53.700
The Capital, sir.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.660
The next time you get anything for
Naya, you bring it to me.

30:58.730 --> 31:00.500
- Yes, sir.
- Okay?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.760
- Would you like to see the Queen?
- No.

31:13.770 --> 31:17.760
I wanted to talk to you.
You're new here, right?

31:17.770 --> 31:21.440
Um, not really.
New to serving the Queen.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.520
Hmm. And before that?

31:24.590 --> 31:28.770
Uh, I did menial work
around town.

31:28.780 --> 31:30.270
Where are you from?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.020
Mimm's Burrow, the Capital.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.490
Ahh, you're from a poor family.

31:36.810 --> 31:40.030
You got a bird yesterday.
Who was it from?

31:40.110 --> 31:42.450
What do you want from me, sir?

31:42.460 --> 31:46.000
- Who was it from?
- It was from my sister.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.870
- My mother is dying.
- Oh.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.750
Remarkable thing, that.

31:51.830 --> 31:54.300
Two girls from Mimm's Burrow
who can read and write.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.600
Your mother must be proud.

31:59.050 --> 32:02.100
We were poor, sir, not ignorant.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.310
I have things to do.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.110
Naya, I thought
I'd surprise you.

32:18.190 --> 32:19.820
Do you want to take a walk
outside the walls with me?

32:19.830 --> 32:21.570
Now's not a really
good time, Janzo.

32:21.650 --> 32:22.820
Come on, just sneak away
for a moment.

32:22.830 --> 32:25.240
Janzo, really, I can't.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.620
There's a kiss in it for you.

32:26.700 --> 32:28.330
Janzo, I can't just
drop everything for you

32:28.340 --> 32:29.710
at a moment's notice.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.200
But I brought you flowers.

32:38.350 --> 32:42.190
This is a well-trod road.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.680
It's the fastest route between
the Outpost and the Capital.

32:44.690 --> 32:47.520
All the traders
and supply caravans use it.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.350
Is that where we're going?
The Capital?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.850
No.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.740
We'll leave this road soon.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.780
Oh, this air,
you don't know how good it is.

33:01.860 --> 33:03.706
On the other side,
you're always choking on ashes.

33:03.730 --> 33:06.660
You have to cover your face
just to go outside.

33:06.740 --> 33:10.160
This land is barren compared
to the village where I grew up.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.670
Is that where we're going?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.890
No, somewhere else.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.390
Well, anyway,
now that we're away from the Outpost,

33:20.470 --> 33:22.510
it's time you call Vikka back.
He'd like this place.

33:23.750 --> 33:25.930
No.

33:26.010 --> 33:29.180
Just think what trouble
we could run into on this road.

33:29.260 --> 33:32.230
Bandits, wolves,
the Prime Order.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.400
- Vikka would protect us.
- We can protect ourselves.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.910
He could hunt for us,
bring us food.

33:36.980 --> 33:37.910
I swore an oath to Gwynn.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.780
So? You've disobeyed her before.

33:39.790 --> 33:41.690
It's not the same
as breaking my word.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.700
- I made a deal to free you.
- Oh, come on,

33:43.770 --> 33:46.420
an oath is only as good
as the person it's made to,

33:46.490 --> 33:47.966
and your queen thinks
all Lu-Qiri are monsters.

33:47.990 --> 33:49.130
Maybe they are.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
The first Lu-Qiri I summoned

33:51.280 --> 33:52.920
killed innocent people
just to torment me.

33:52.950 --> 33:56.170
Baphnoro?

33:56.240 --> 33:58.170
He hunted alone.
He had no master.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.510
I'm surprised
you even tamed him at all.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.760
Vikka would do as I command.

34:03.770 --> 34:05.730
- He won't hurt anyone unless...
- I gave my word.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.770
You believe your Queen and
the Prime Order are opposites

34:11.780 --> 34:14.520
just because one is less
of a tyrant than the other,

34:14.600 --> 34:17.270
but both would banish us
just the same.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.110
Your queen would just do it in
the name of protecting her people.

34:19.120 --> 34:23.659
- Well, doesn't that make her a good queen?
- Perhaps for humans.

34:23.739 --> 34:27.030
But the Blackbloods will never
be welcome among them.

34:27.110 --> 34:30.239
Those in power will always fear
us because we're different.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.699
The Realm is big.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.460
There's room for all of us.

34:36.969 --> 34:39.136
Someday soon you're going to
have to pick a side, Talon.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.300
I just hope when that day comes,

34:41.310 --> 34:43.219
we're standing together.

34:57.139 --> 35:00.270
Your Majesty,
it has come to my attention

35:00.350 --> 35:02.150
that you haven't inspected
your fields as of late.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.070
I'm sure the common folk
will want to see their queen

35:04.080 --> 35:05.320
as much as these fops.

35:05.330 --> 35:06.830
Will you join me for a ride?

35:06.910 --> 35:09.540
I'll deal with the fops.

35:14.340 --> 35:15.550
Excellent.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.120
There she is, my kingdom.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.170
She certainly
has seen better days.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.170
Nonsense.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.050
I think she's quite the beauty.

36:07.060 --> 36:10.050
I look forward to
getting to know her more.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.356
You're supposed
to be looking out there.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.060
No, this is more
pleasant to look at.

36:14.140 --> 36:16.220
Are you trying to woo me, sir?

36:16.230 --> 36:19.190
Oh, it depends.
Is it working?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.780
Perhaps. A little bit.

36:25.230 --> 36:26.466
You know, there is something
else you could do for me.

36:26.490 --> 36:28.410
Name it, Your Majesty.

36:28.490 --> 36:34.160
Make peace with
your cousin Milus.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.580
Never. - He has a sizeable
army, and he is your blood.

36:37.590 --> 36:39.630
Your two peoples
are alike in every way,

36:39.710 --> 36:42.880
- so, unite them.
- Our people may be alike,

36:42.950 --> 36:45.920
but he is worse than a snake.

36:45.930 --> 36:49.420
Yes, my advisor said that
there's a feud between you?

36:49.430 --> 36:52.720
His grandfather was scum, his father
was scum, and Milus is no different.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.270
- We don't need allies like him.
- Yes, but we do need allies.

36:56.350 --> 37:00.770
- So, if not Milus, then who?
- Anyone else.

37:00.780 --> 37:02.520
What was the offense committed?

37:02.600 --> 37:05.270
His grandfather built a wall
over my grandfather's land

37:05.280 --> 37:07.280
and claimed it as his own.

37:07.360 --> 37:11.740
My grandfather knocked down his
wall, and they went to war.

37:11.810 --> 37:17.740
A grandfather's war.
Ah, the things we inherit.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.796
If my memory serves me correctly
from my history lessons,

37:19.820 --> 37:22.970
your fathers actually made
peace, but then never spoke.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.526
Was there some other crime committed
after that that I'm not aware of?

37:25.550 --> 37:28.960
- No.
- And has Milus done any harm?

37:28.970 --> 37:32.470
- He is a snake.
- Has he done anything?

37:32.480 --> 37:35.760
He cannot be trusted.
He wants my land.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.100
Disputes can be mended, Tobin.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.730
Give him the disputed land

37:41.800 --> 37:44.150
in exchange
for declaring his support.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.060
I need you
to swallow your pride.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.480
That, my lord,

37:50.500 --> 37:52.280
is the greatest gift
you can give your queen.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.250
My own men
might lose faith in me.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.500
Convince them it's a victory,
not a surrender.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.800
You are something else, Rosmund.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.090
The ride was exhilarating.

38:12.170 --> 38:14.816
And Tobin said that he would try and
make amends with his cousin Milus.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.590
If he succeeds,
then the other noblemen

38:16.670 --> 38:20.180
might turn in their favor
and line up behind us.

38:20.190 --> 38:22.810
But we must act fast.

38:22.890 --> 38:24.600
If the Prime Order discover,

38:24.680 --> 38:26.450
then they'll move
quickly to stop us.

38:29.610 --> 38:32.030
You're awfully quiet
this evening.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.820
Apologies, ma'am.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.330
Just wrapped up
in my own thoughts, I guess.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.840
We'll set up camp here.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.100
It's good hunting country.

38:54.060 --> 38:55.840
Want to go catch us
something to eat?

38:55.920 --> 38:57.390
Save the rations?

38:57.470 --> 38:59.560
I do all my hunting
with Vikka by my side.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.220
You mean Vikka does
all the hunting with you

39:01.230 --> 39:03.400
- by his side.
- No, that's not what I...

39:03.480 --> 39:05.400
Can you at least make a fire?

39:05.480 --> 39:06.900
Or does Vikka
do that for you, too?

40:03.990 --> 40:06.540
Garret?

40:06.610 --> 40:08.460
Talon! What in the gods
are you doing out here?
