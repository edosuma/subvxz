09:33.906 --> 09:36.533
- Right on top.
- Good eye, Charles.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.828
Is that a plank?

09:39.912 --> 09:41.746
It looks like a plank.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.156
JACK:
Ooh!

09:43.249 --> 09:45.491
That's a nice cut plank.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.502
If you look at it, Jack,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.254
like, the edges are rounded,
but, you know,

09:49.338 --> 09:50.589
it could be just from age.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.591
JACK: Is that the
right width for a plank?

09:52.675 --> 09:53.758
CHARLES:
Yeah.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.502
It could be more,
more pieces of a ship.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.839
Yeah. That's definitely where
we found that piece of railing.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.099
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.767
Who knows
what this could date to.

10:02.926 --> 10:04.594
CHARLES: Yeah. But
we're definitely gonna save it,

10:04.678 --> 10:07.096
and we'll hopefully find
something else.

10:07.181 --> 10:09.599
Yeah. You know, you have
a rail, you have planks.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.192
CHARLES:
That's right.

10:11.352 --> 10:12.277
It's becoming a little bit more

10:12.436 --> 10:14.354
than just coincidence now,
it seems.

10:14.438 --> 10:15.905
<i>- JACK: Exactly.
- CHARLES: Yeah.</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:21.944

10:22.029 --> 10:23.121
No.
(grunts)

10:23.205 --> 10:25.365
It's really quiet.

10:25.449 --> 10:27.784

10:47.721 --> 10:49.731
The C-1 cluster--

10:49.890 --> 10:50.982
We were really successful,

10:51.067 --> 10:53.810
but I think we've done
as much as we can do

10:53.894 --> 10:55.153
and we need to move
somewhere else.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.562
So, you had an area

10:56.647 --> 10:59.157
that you really liked, Rick,
down here to the west.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.326
- RICK: Yeah.
- S-So, I think we're gonna focus on that,

11:01.485 --> 11:03.411
if, uh... if that's
what you'd still like to do.

11:03.570 --> 11:06.331
I do. I've always thought

11:06.490 --> 11:08.583
the way to figure out
the Money Pit was

11:08.668 --> 11:12.328
finding Shaft Six
and the tunnel from Six.

11:12.413 --> 11:15.840
<i>NARRATOR:

11:15.999 --> 11:18.167
<i>members

11:20.096 --> 11:22.672
<i>two stacked
wooden treasure chests</i>

<i>at a depth of approximately 100
feet in the original Money Pit.</i>

11:26.927 --> 11:29.187
<i>In an effort to retrieve them,</i>

11:29.271 --> 11:31.773
<i>while avoiding
the legendary flood tunnels,</i>

11:31.857 --> 11:35.768
<i>the team dug an adjacent shaft
18 feet to the west</i>

11:35.853 --> 11:37.937
<i>known as Shaft Six</i>

11:38.021 --> 11:41.691
<i>to a depth of 118 feet.</i>

11:41.775 --> 11:43.860
<i>As they tunneled their way
toward what they hoped</i>

11:43.944 --> 11:46.362
<i>would be the ultimate discovery,</i>

11:46.447 --> 11:49.374
<i>seawater suddenly burst
through the soil,</i>

11:49.458 --> 11:51.033
<i>flooding the tunnel,</i>

11:51.118 --> 11:54.295
<i>which resulted in a catastrophic
collapse of the wood cribbing</i>

11:54.455 --> 11:55.955
<i>in the Money Pit.</i>

11:56.048 --> 11:59.300
<i>The disaster not only ended
their efforts</i>

11:59.460 --> 12:02.545
<i>but is believed to have left
the contents of the two chests</i>

12:02.629 --> 12:05.724
<i>scattered
across a flooded debris field.</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:08.393
<i>RICK: I have always believed
that the way to find the Money Pit</i>

12:08.477 --> 12:10.228
<i>is to find Shaft Six</i>

12:10.312 --> 12:12.221
<i>and the tunnel associated
with it</i>

12:12.306 --> 12:14.816
<i>because of the collapse story.</i>

12:14.975 --> 12:16.809
There has to be a tunnel there,

12:16.902 --> 12:19.979
and 18 feet away from that
would be the Money Pit.

12:20.063 --> 12:23.232
So, to that, you know,
we-we're gonna set them up

12:23.317 --> 12:24.817
on G-2 as of now.

12:24.902 --> 12:26.911
And the math works
that if this is Shaft Six,

12:26.996 --> 12:29.071
C-I could potentially be
the Money Pit.

12:29.156 --> 12:31.824
RICK: Two things are
achievable goals down there.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.170
One is, can we find
the orientation of the shaft?

12:35.329 --> 12:38.506
And, two, can we discern where
our tunnel may come off of it?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.342
<i>NARRATOR: If the team can
successfully locate the tunnel</i>

12:41.502 --> 12:44.179
<i>connected to Shaft Six,</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:46.848
<i>they might not only find
what is showing trace evidence</i>

12:47.007 --> 12:48.341
<i>of silver and gold</i>

12:48.434 --> 12:51.603
<i>in the various boreholes
across the Money Pit area</i>

12:51.762 --> 12:54.680
<i>but also whatever else
may lie buried</i>

12:54.765 --> 12:57.734
<i>in the original treasure shaft
itself.</i>

12:58.861 --> 13:01.780
So, if C-1 is
the original Money Pit,

13:01.864 --> 13:05.033
the math works that this is--
I've calculated 17 feet away

13:05.117 --> 13:06.534
but historical records say 18.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.110
- Am I right, Doug?
- 18 feet. - 18 feet.

13:08.195 --> 13:09.454
Right.
But what we need to ascertain

13:09.538 --> 13:10.622
- is the orientation.
- That's right.

13:10.781 --> 13:11.790
Yes.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.375
So let's let
the drill program proceed.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.120
Let's see what G-2 tells us
and then move from there.

13:18.205 --> 13:18.955
Fair enough?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.799
- Sounds good.
- All righty.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.291

13:43.489 --> 13:45.490
- Lot 22.
- Why?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.576
All this area here
is on Zena's map.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.237
There's, like, a hatch mentioned

13:51.321 --> 13:52.997
- in this old French map.
- Okay.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.242
So, we've got
loads of flags here,

13:56.335 --> 13:59.161

a bit of Oak Island history.

I always love it when we recover
a piece of lead like this.

Because until it's cleaned up,
we don't know, mate,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.730
whether this is
a decorated piece of lead

16:22.815 --> 16:27.902
or it's just left over from
making something made of lead

16:27.987 --> 16:29.145
- in a mold.

<i>of a large cart or wagon wheel?</i>

19:15.729 --> 19:19.157

19:33.422 --> 19:35.506
All right.
Let's put it in the bag

19:35.591 --> 19:38.009
- and-and mark this area.
- There we go.

19:38.168 --> 19:40.428

Oh, yeah.

21:32.866 --> 21:34.458
CHARLES:
What you got, Adam?

21:34.617 --> 21:36.035
75.

21:36.119 --> 21:37.786
- Wood.
- What do you got?

21:37.871 --> 21:39.538
- You got wood.
- We got wood.

21:39.622 --> 21:41.632
We are in blue-gray till
as well.

21:41.791 --> 21:44.302
So we're kind of in situ.
That's important.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.965
- Okay. Well, we were in blue-gray till.
- Oh.

21:50.050 --> 21:52.384
And what do we got?
Hmm, smell that.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.219
That smells...

21:54.304 --> 21:55.730
We got a lot here, too.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.640
Yeah, we've got some stacked
timbers there, it looks like.

21:58.725 --> 22:04.155
<i>NARRATOR: Wood found at a

22:04.314 --> 22:06.815
<i>Could it be connected

22:06.900 --> 22:11.070
<i>Or is it a completely different
man-made structure?</i>

22:11.163 --> 22:15.491
So, that's really quite
an important development.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.586
So that says to me
probably the shaft.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.079
Yeah.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.748
We're probably in the shaft
that we're looking for.

22:22.832 --> 22:24.583
I would say.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.094
I'm gonna want to take,
uh, samples of this.

22:27.253 --> 22:28.679

Yeah, absolutely.

Yeah.

for this hole.

23:09.379 --> 23:10.388
Yeah.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.561
We got more wood, Terry.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.146
TERRY:
Oh, that's cool.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.556
Would you say stacked timbers?

23:20.649 --> 23:21.982
- Definitely stacked.
- Looks...

23:22.067 --> 23:25.152
Oh, yeah, that's stacked timbers
for sure. Look at that.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.071
Stacked and split apart.

23:28.565 --> 23:31.817
Terry, I'm gonna text Rick
and just let him know

23:31.901 --> 23:33.068
that we're hitting wood
at these two levels.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.578
- Yeah.
- Just give him a heads-up.

23:36.072 --> 23:37.581
Here we go.

23:39.159 --> 23:40.584
What's the good word, Adam?

23:40.743 --> 23:42.253
89.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.079
TERRY:
Okay. Thank you.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.091
Let's operate on this bad boy.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.052
(grunts)

23:52.589 --> 23:55.340
- CHARLES: Oh, yeah. (chuckling)
- Look at that.

23:55.425 --> 23:56.842
That is

23:56.926 --> 23:59.186
- a good old-fashioned shaft right there.
- Absolutely.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.688
Totally agree.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.273
TERRY:
84 to 89,

24:02.432 --> 24:04.683
we got five foot
of stacked timbers.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.445
So, if this is Shaft Six,

24:07.529 --> 24:08.854
we're gonna be able
to place this

24:08.938 --> 24:11.532
- fairly well.
- That's right.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.701
We're starting to see some wood.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.778
<i>That can tell us that we're
actually in the right spot.</i>

24:16.863 --> 24:19.364
<i>So, if this is the shaft,</i>

24:19.449 --> 24:21.450
then, from that,
we'll look for the tunnel.

24:21.534 --> 24:24.369
<i>We can determine
the orientation of that tunnel.</i>

24:24.454 --> 24:26.872
<i>Bingo. We've nailed
where the Money Pit is.</i>

24:26.956 --> 24:29.717
And we can finally put
an "X" on the ground.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.552
CHARLES:
Hey, Rick.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.711
- TERRY: Hi, Rick.
- Hi.

24:32.795 --> 24:34.463
We've got some wood.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.223
But how much?
Are you in a wall?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.966
We've got a substantial
intersection.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.477
- Are you in a wall?
- Yes.

24:39.636 --> 24:42.054
Oh, definitely we're in a wall.
Right here.

24:42.138 --> 24:43.564
Oh, yeah.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.566
Started about ten feet
above that.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.392
Yeah.

24:47.477 --> 24:50.070
I was very interested
in the results at G-2.

24:50.230 --> 24:52.731
<i>Because my hope is that</i>

24:52.815 --> 24:55.993
<i>it will encounter the tunnel
from Shaft Six.</i>

24:56.077 --> 24:57.402
<i>It's my white whale.</i>

24:57.496 --> 25:00.072
<i>It's something I've pursued
since the beginning.</i>

25:00.165 --> 25:03.992
<i>My hope is that this location
will yield some answer.</i>

25:04.077 --> 25:05.586
No metal?

25:05.670 --> 25:07.004
I haven't run
the pinpointer over it.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.164
We have it opened up.
We wanted you to see if first.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.842
No, do it.
It confirms that wall.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.752
But where is it, you know?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.346
Yeah, exactly.

25:15.505 --> 25:17.681
- It's got to be a shaft wall.
- Oh, yeah.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.174
- We're over ten feet so far.
- Has to be.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.685
With this and the hits we've hit

25:21.844 --> 25:24.104
previously,
we hopefully will be able

25:24.189 --> 25:26.440
to get some kind of orientation.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.192
And we have
a chunk of wood up here

25:28.351 --> 25:31.362
that shows beautiful, uh,
parallel saw marks.

25:31.446 --> 25:32.446
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.689
That's what I was looking for.

25:33.773 --> 25:35.357
- Yep. For sure.
- Great.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.192
- Okay.
- So we're pretty happy.

25:37.277 --> 25:38.443
Go, Charles.

25:38.528 --> 25:39.870
Very happy.

25:43.283 --> 25:44.700
(beeping)

25:44.784 --> 25:46.126
That's good.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.711
Should be right there.

25:47.870 --> 25:48.712

and the debris field.

26:46.429 --> 26:48.430
Could be.

Well, it turns out
we're actually in a shaft.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.239
Charles was metal-detecting...

27:47.332 --> 27:49.500
and curiously...

27:49.584 --> 27:51.669
this came out.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.162
DOUG:
An old nail.

27:54.247 --> 27:57.174
RICK: My first thought was to
bring it down and put it in the XRF.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.760
But, specifically,
what I was hoping is,

27:59.919 --> 28:02.262
look for manganese and see

28:02.347 --> 28:04.848
if that timeline,
pre- or post-1840,

28:04.933 --> 28:07.101
- fits with our suspicion...
- Yes!

28:07.260 --> 28:08.760
That it's Shaft Six.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.595
If it's pre-1840,

28:10.680 --> 28:13.682
it doesn't really fit
into our understanding

28:13.775 --> 28:15.934
of the construct
of the Shaft Six.

28:16.018 --> 28:17.695
Well, it should
certainly suggest if it is

28:17.779 --> 28:19.354
pre- or post-1840.

28:19.439 --> 28:21.365
Let's find out.

28:21.524 --> 28:22.858
So, if we pop
this little window out here,

28:22.951 --> 28:25.026
we can see
how our alignment looks.

28:25.111 --> 28:26.370
Looks like we're getting
all of the nail right there,

28:26.454 --> 28:28.038
so let's try that.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.449

29:50.696 --> 29:51.872

like they piled timber

29:54.292 --> 29:56.293

it got stuck on the timber,

29:56.452 --> 29:58.787

- Yeah.

29:58.871 --> 30:02.049

one year ago,</i>

38:08.703 --> 38:12.280
<i>lining the stone pathway along
the eastern border of the swamp,</i>

38:12.364 --> 38:15.542
<i>the late Fred Nolan found
a number of them running</i>

38:15.626 --> 38:17.535
<i>through the middle
of the brackish bog</i>

38:17.628 --> 38:19.546
<i>in 1969.</i>

38:19.630 --> 38:22.299
<i>Is it possible
that Billy and Jack</i>

38:22.458 --> 38:24.884
<i>have found another stake
connected to those</i>

38:24.969 --> 38:28.463
<i>unearthed by Fred
more than a half century ago?</i>

38:28.547 --> 38:31.641
<i>If so, what were they lining?</i>

38:31.726 --> 38:35.053
<i>And might they be related in
some way to the 200-foot-long</i>

38:35.137 --> 38:39.557
<i>anomaly detected in 2018
by seismic scanning?</i>

38:39.650 --> 38:42.226
<i>One eerily resembling
the length and size</i>

38:42.311 --> 38:45.322
<i>of a massive ship?</i>

38:45.481 --> 38:47.157
The stakes that are there
have been formed,

38:47.241 --> 38:48.816
are clearly ax-cut.

38:48.901 --> 38:51.161
<i>So this is an interesting piece.</i>

38:51.320 --> 38:54.405
<i>It's clearly wood
for some sort of</i>

38:54.490 --> 38:55.749
<i>very specific purpose.</i>

38:55.908 --> 38:57.575
<i>It could be significant.</i>

38:57.659 --> 38:59.336
<i>I knew there would be
wood in the swamp.</i>

38:59.420 --> 39:01.838
Every time we dig we find
some human-shaped wood,

39:01.922 --> 39:03.840
but they're finding a lot.

39:03.924 --> 39:07.427
<i>I'm kind of surprised at what
keeps coming out of that swamp.</i>

39:07.586 --> 39:10.180
This is pretty cool, too.
I mean, it's clearly a plank.

39:10.339 --> 39:12.265
It's about the same size
as the barrel tops.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.508
RICK:
Same depth?

39:13.592 --> 39:15.685
- JACK: Yeah.
- BILLY: Yep.

39:17.012 --> 39:19.272
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.691
JACK: I think maybe
both of these are actually...

39:21.776 --> 39:24.268
- Markers of some sort?
- Well, yeah.

39:24.353 --> 39:27.197
<i>RICK: The swamp work, of course,
has provided some great finds,</i>

39:27.281 --> 39:29.273
areas of great interest.

39:29.358 --> 39:32.193
<i>The hope is that we can
continue to make finds</i>

39:32.277 --> 39:34.362
<i>that we can apply science to,</i>

39:34.455 --> 39:36.790
<i>to maybe come up
with an artifact</i>

39:36.949 --> 39:38.625
<i>that is an aha moment.</i>

39:38.709 --> 39:40.460
I still believe
there's answers there.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.879
JACK:
So, what tests can we have done

39:42.963 --> 39:45.873
to these pieces, 'cause
we can't have specific dendro

39:45.958 --> 39:47.050
done to something like this.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.968
No, but C-14 done to that.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.461
But what about this
piece of wood?

39:50.546 --> 39:51.963
- MARTY: Maybe that, too.
- Is it big enough for dendro?

39:52.047 --> 39:53.556
MARTY: It matters how
many rings are on there.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.551
If it was an old growth,
it could be.

39:56.635 --> 39:59.887
<i>NARRATOR: Dendrochronology
is a cutting-edge dating method</i>

39:59.972 --> 40:03.057
<i>that entails analyzing
the tree rings present</i>

40:03.150 --> 40:04.984
<i>on pieces of shaped wood.</i>

40:05.069 --> 40:08.146
<i>It can determine not only
the age of the artifact</i>

40:08.239 --> 40:12.650
<i>but also the precise date
that it was cut for use.</i>

40:12.734 --> 40:15.662
That one strikes me as older.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.822
- This one. I think that's older.
- Just visually, it seems.

40:17.906 --> 40:19.657
MARTY: Yeah, all right, well,
you know what I'm gonna say.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.409
These are cool.

40:21.493 --> 40:24.328
Go find something
that explains what they are.

40:24.413 --> 40:26.831
The swamp is yielding things.

40:26.915 --> 40:28.583
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, guys.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.009
Let's go get some more stuff.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.010
<i>Let's get after it.</i>

40:31.170 --> 40:31.928
<i>LAIRD:
All right.</i>

40:33.922 --> 40:36.924
<i>NARRATOR:
For 226 years,</i>

40:37.009 --> 40:39.343
<i>the Money Pit has been
the focus of nearly</i>

40:39.428 --> 40:42.689
<i>all those who attempted
to solve the Oak Island mystery.</i>

40:42.773 --> 40:46.934
<i>And while the traces
of silver and gold that Rick,</i>

40:47.019 --> 40:49.437
<i>Marty, Craig
and their team have recovered</i>

40:49.521 --> 40:52.031
<i>suggest that a major discovery</i>

40:52.191 --> 40:53.941
<i>still awaits them there,</i>

40:54.026 --> 40:56.453
<i>could the clues</i>

40:56.612 --> 40:59.197
<i>that they are finding
all across the island</i>

40:59.290 --> 41:02.033
<i>mean that many more
and valuable secrets</i>

41:02.117 --> 41:04.794
<i>also lie in wait?</i>

41:04.879 --> 41:09.040
<i>The drilling and digging
will continue.</i>

41:09.124 --> 41:11.718
<i>The rest is up to fate...</i>

41:11.877 --> 41:14.045
<i>and perhaps the curse</i>

41:14.138 --> 41:15.972
<i>of Oak Island.</i>

41:17.883 --> 41:20.810
<i>Next time</i>
<i>on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:20.895 --> 41:23.313
The Portuguese found signs
of gold here

41:23.397 --> 41:25.482
and needed a place
to hide it away.

41:25.641 --> 41:27.817
- Wow.
- If that is indeed Shaft Six,

41:27.902 --> 41:30.987
we know there's a tunnel leading
directly to the Money Pit.

41:31.146 --> 41:32.989
You follow the tunnel,
it's game on then.

41:33.148 --> 41:34.574
<i>GARY:
All it takes is one good find.</i>

41:34.658 --> 41:35.900
What's that right there, Gary?

41:35.984 --> 41:36.910
Oh, that's interesting.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.578
It might be a lid.

41:38.662 --> 41:39.746
There could be a chest in there.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.988
That's pretty amazing.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.499
<i>RICK:
You'll hold in your hand</i>

41:42.658 --> 41:44.751
<i>the irrefutable proof

41:44.835 --> 41:46.085
of Oak Island is real.
