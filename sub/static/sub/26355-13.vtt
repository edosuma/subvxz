Now, those are
what my granddaddy called

00:40.206 --> 00:42.040
"proposin' peaches."

00:42.041 --> 00:43.917
Don't be shy, now. Dig in.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.134
Whoa-ho!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.511
Here I go.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.019
Don't you do it.
Don't you go to the gross side.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.437
It's out of my control.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.105
They're too... juicy.

01:05.105 --> 01:06.565
We exchanged a look earlier.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.067
We have a grossed-out,
no-fun alliance.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.362
So, you guys like peaches, huh?

01:12.363 --> 01:13.739
- Yeah.
- Hold on.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.909
I need a large pane of glass.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.911
Well, I got her phone number.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.829
How do you like them peaches?

01:20.830 --> 01:22.498
"888-LAP-BAND"?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.750
Covered by most insurance.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.919
Guys, check it out.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.463
In honor of opening day
at Fenway Park this weekend,

01:29.464 --> 01:32.591
the Red Sox are offering
four tickets behind home plate

01:32.592 --> 01:35.761
to the person who makes
the best Red Sox ad.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.471
Oh...

01:36.471 --> 01:37.096
My...

01:37.097 --> 01:38.097
Freaking...

01:40.141 --> 01:43.185
Guys, winning those seats
is our highest priority.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.272
Even higher than my dream
of winning socks-on karate.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.820
Point! Winner!

01:52.821 --> 01:54.239
Ow!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.495
Ah, this is the life.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.206
- Thanks, Peter.
- I still can't believe you won

02:04.207 --> 02:06.625
by filming yourself pooping
in a Yankees helmet.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.627
I am not a subtle filmmaker,

02:08.627 --> 02:11.130
and my audience
wouldn't have it any other way.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.841
Joe, what are you eating
your ice cream out of?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.176
They ran out of those
mini batting helmets,

02:16.177 --> 02:18.262
so they're serving it
in athletic cups.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.514
Did you buy that
from a certified vendor?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.559
He wasn't behind the counter,
but he had a blue shirt on.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.270
I think somebody might be
having a little fun with you.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.022
Yeah, come to think of it,
he did have a friend filming,

02:29.023 --> 02:32.234
and he made me eat the first
seven bites in front of him,

02:32.235 --> 02:34.111
and he didn't charge me
anything.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.779
Do you, uh...

02:35.780 --> 02:37.531
do you want this?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.783
I'll take a bite.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.786
Four beers, please.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.621
Anything else, fellas?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.290
Uh, yeah, I'll have a beer.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.791
Anyone else want another?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.209
Yeah, why not?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.003
- Quagmire?
- I'm good.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.796
I'm good with one more.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.214
- Cleveland?
- I'm fine.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.133
Yeah,
I'm fine with one more, too.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.053
I-I'm gonna take it
with me to the can.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.186
All right, now to have
the only exciting thing

03:08.187 --> 03:11.398
in the game happen
as soon as I turn my back.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.094 --> 03:42.179
Hey, buddy,
that's just a break in the line

03:42.180 --> 03:43.430
so people can pass through.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.933
End of the line's that way.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.061
Yeah, it's all the way
to that guy with the scorebook

03:49.062 --> 03:50.687
just waiting
for someone to talk to.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.689
Don't get used to Benintendi's
two-strike hitting.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.108
His history will tell you
it's not a sustainable pace

03:55.109 --> 03:56.860
for an everyday outfielder.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.862
Aw, screw that.
I'm using the ladies' room.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.198
How bad could it be?

04:02.742 --> 04:04.159
I saw a mouse.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.080
Buddy, if you really gotta go,
you can use that one.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.749
A bathroom for Prince?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.668
I can't use that.
I'm not Prince.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.419
It's not for Prince.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.089
Space Cats?
I'm not a Space Cat.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.801
Sir, I can assure you there's
no such thing as Space Cats.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.804
Now, can you direct me
to Earth's reserve of yarn?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.181
Aw, screw this.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.100
Excuse me, ma'am,
could you direct me

04:28.101 --> 04:30.978
to Earth's reserve
of near-empty tuna tins?

04:30.979 --> 04:33.022
Are you a Space Cat?

04:34.816 --> 04:36.942
- He's been made.
- We've got to call him back.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.111
Psst, psst.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.697
Psst, psst.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.409
Guys! I found the best toilet
in the whole place.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.620
- Next time...
- Peter! You're on the jumbotron!

04:48.621 --> 04:50.622
- Where?
- Right there!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.624
- Here?
- There, Peter, there!

04:52.625 --> 04:53.792
Here? Yes?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.669
It's right in front
of you, Peter!

04:55.670 --> 04:57.295
- Right here?
- CLEVELAND and QUAGMIRE: No!

04:57.296 --> 04:58.964
- Oh, over here?
- Damn it, Peter,

04:58.965 --> 05:00.090
you're gonna miss it!

05:00.091 --> 05:02.134
Is-is this... is this it?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.219
Aha! Where?

05:04.220 --> 05:07.139
Guys, look!
I'm on the jumbotron!

05:07.140 --> 05:09.141
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.393
let's give a big Boston welcome
to Peter Griffin,

05:11.394 --> 05:14.730
the fist transgender
Red Sox fan.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.065
Peter, you used
the transgender bathroom,

05:17.066 --> 05:19.651
so now everyone thinks
you're transgender.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.070
Cleveland, what are you eating
your Cracker Jacks out of?

05:22.071 --> 05:24.531
Oh, the guy said they
were out of regular boxes,

05:24.532 --> 05:27.242
- so he gave me this box.
- What did he look like?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.660
Like this.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.329
Hey, that's the ice cream guy!

05:31.330 --> 05:33.373
I got a handful, too, Peter.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.625
You want to see
who can finish faster?

05:35.626 --> 05:37.002
You're on!

05:37.003 --> 05:38.879
It looks like
we've got ourselves

05:38.880 --> 05:41.132
a good old-fashioned
Cracker Jack off.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.222
Good morning, Peter.
We saw the game last night,

05:49.223 --> 05:51.224
and, well,
we just want you to know

05:51.225 --> 05:54.186
that we wholeheartedly support
all transgender people.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.563
- But I'm not...
- Peter, before you say anything

05:56.564 --> 05:59.024
that might clear all this up,
let me tell you

05:59.025 --> 06:03.195
about our stellar transgender
employee benefit package.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.739
Benefits?
I'm trans-listening.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.742
Well, as such, you're entitled
to supplemental time off,

06:08.743 --> 06:10.160
our on-site masseuse

06:10.161 --> 06:12.871
and a $60 gift card
from Nordstrom Rack.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.414
- Nordstrom?!
- Rack.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.416
- Yeah, but Nordstrom!
- Yes, I understand.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.126
But it's just... Rack.

06:18.127 --> 06:21.088
Well, in the words
of trailblazer Caitlyn Jenner,

06:21.089 --> 06:23.590
"I will do anything
for money and attention."

06:23.591 --> 06:25.133
So brave.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.303
Great. We'll send the paperwork
down to your office.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.223
Well, better use
the men's room one last time.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.100
Lot of history in there.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.062
♪ ♪

06:40.399 --> 06:41.567
You.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.112
And you,
the Hungry Hungry Hippo.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.573
You'd always swallow it
before I could see what I did.

06:48.574 --> 06:52.161
And one last look at my crack
imprint on the walk of fame.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.791
God, I remember that day.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.793
I would find out later

06:59.794 --> 07:02.045
that when you put your ass
in wet cement,

07:02.046 --> 07:03.839
you're just
sealing it shut forever.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.216
Best they could do
was poke holes in it

07:06.217 --> 07:08.468
so it comes out
like Play-Doh spaghetti.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.346
Anyway, that's the first act.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.521
Peter, pretending to be
transgender to get time off work

07:19.522 --> 07:22.357
trivializes a real struggle
in this country.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.110
Did the... did the Space Cats
get to you?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.029
I don't know what that is,
but you gotta knock this off.

07:28.030 --> 07:32.159
And direct me to Earth's reserve
of sun-dappled window seats.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.827
Lois is right, Peter.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.996
Besides the fact that
you're lying to your employers,

07:35.997 --> 07:37.664
you're taking advantage
of a civil liberty

07:37.665 --> 07:38.957
that so many oppressed people

07:38.958 --> 07:40.500
have fought
their entire lives for.

07:40.747 --> 07:43.374
Shut your mouth, Brian.
I'm part of a movement.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.583
Hey, what is
"transgender," anyway?

07:44.584 --> 07:46.210
Is that the stuff
in potato chips

07:46.211 --> 07:48.087
that makes your bum go bam?

07:48.088 --> 07:50.297
It-it's pointless
arguing with you.

07:50.298 --> 07:52.633
Cool. Now, in order
to pull this off,

07:52.634 --> 07:54.635
I'm gonna have to look the part.

07:54.636 --> 07:56.637
Lois, which dress may I borrow?

07:56.638 --> 07:59.682
None! My closet is off-limits!

07:59.683 --> 08:02.643
Fine. There's got to be
something in the attic.

08:02.644 --> 08:05.813
I can't even begin to describe
the density of illness

08:05.814 --> 08:07.773
I feel in my bone marrow
right now.

08:07.774 --> 08:10.192
That is... that is
how appalled I am by this.

08:10.193 --> 08:11.861
- Other guys?
- Sorry, Peter.

08:11.862 --> 08:14.071
I don't see you getting away
with this one.

08:14.072 --> 08:15.698
Look, Peter,
the good news is

08:15.699 --> 08:17.908
you still fit
in your wife's wedding gown.

08:17.909 --> 08:19.785
Not every guy can say that.

08:19.786 --> 08:22.371
It's actually Meg's.
She commits murders in it.

08:22.372 --> 08:23.873
What's this, now?

08:23.874 --> 08:26.292
That's just it, Peter, this
whole thing is a joke to you.

08:26.293 --> 08:28.419
Are you forgetting
I have a dad who's a woman?

08:28.420 --> 08:29.962
No, of course not.
That's the first thing

08:29.963 --> 08:31.255
everyone thinks of
when they see you.

08:31.256 --> 08:32.590
But th-this isn't like that.

08:32.591 --> 08:34.799
And I thought you guys
would support me.

08:34.801 --> 08:37.344
Like we all supported Joe
on that road trip.

08:37.345 --> 08:40.014
- Boy, I am stuffed.
- Oh, I forgot to mention,

08:40.015 --> 08:42.308
one of you guys
has to be in charge

08:42.308 --> 08:43.976
of changing my diaper
the whole trip.

08:43.977 --> 08:45.519
Why don't we all
just switch off?

08:45.520 --> 08:47.938
Oh, there will be other jobs
for other people.

08:47.939 --> 08:50.483
Okay, I guess we should,
like, draw straws or something.

08:50.484 --> 08:52.193
Actually,
I've been observing all of you

08:52.194 --> 08:55.738
for the past few hours,
and I choose Quagmire.

08:55.739 --> 08:58.240
- What?! Why me?
- You've got long fingers.

08:58.241 --> 09:00.326
And I feel like
you wouldn't crack

09:00.327 --> 09:02.661
if things start to go south.

09:02.662 --> 09:05.372
Fine.
How do I know when it's time?

09:05.373 --> 09:08.000
Well, I'll turn to you,
very sincerely,

09:08.001 --> 09:10.419
and I'll look you
right in your eyes,

09:10.420 --> 09:14.006
and I'll say,
"Quagmire, I've got poopies."

09:14.007 --> 09:15.341
Ugh.

09:15.342 --> 09:16.926
Now, Quagmire, I've...

09:16.927 --> 09:19.011
- You got poopies. I know.
- No!

09:19.012 --> 09:22.306
You're supposed
to let me say it!

09:22.307 --> 09:24.808
Quagmire...

09:24.809 --> 09:26.937
I've got poopies.

09:32.108 --> 09:33.943
- Dad!
- Dad!

09:33.944 --> 09:36.403
How goes the transition,
Mr. Griffin?

09:36.404 --> 09:39.490
Like Huma Abedin, I'm trying
to forget about my Weiner.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.742
Whoa, we're doing Cheers,
not Frasier.

09:41.743 --> 09:43.744
Tough day, Dad?

09:43.745 --> 09:45.871
I don't get it.
How does Rebel Wilson

09:45.872 --> 09:47.248
always look so fetching?

09:47.249 --> 09:49.250
- Does she, though?
- You could be, too,

09:49.251 --> 09:52.045
if you just let
your hair down a little.

09:55.674 --> 09:59.176
Now you just take that beautiful
hair down to the salon,

09:59.177 --> 10:00.803
and you'll be a ten.

10:00.804 --> 10:02.096
On a scale of a billion?

10:02.097 --> 10:03.430
Thanks, Chris.

10:03.431 --> 10:06.392
Thanks for helping me
at 11:30 on a school day.

10:06.393 --> 10:08.310

17:37.385 --> 17:39.302
When I first met you, Peter,

17:39.303 --> 17:41.805
I was already at the end
of a long journey

17:41.806 --> 17:43.849
to find the courage
to become a woman.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.893
But before that,
I lived for 61 years

17:46.894 --> 17:49.813
as a miserable, miserable man.

17:49.814 --> 17:52.566
I grew up in the small town
of Football, Texas,

17:52.567 --> 17:55.610
and from the age of eight,
I was mercilessly teased

17:55.611 --> 17:59.364
for being different
and "dressing funny."

17:59.365 --> 18:02.451
Then, at the age of 14,
I had an epiphany.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.244
It was so clear.

18:04.245 --> 18:07.372
I was a girl
trapped in a boy's body.

18:07.373 --> 18:10.375
I'm having a hard time focusing
without a drink, but go on.

18:10.376 --> 18:15.297
It took me 47 years from that
day to officially own who I am.

18:15.298 --> 18:17.466
Is there a waiter or...?

18:17.467 --> 18:21.470
In those 47 years, I became
an expert at hiding my secret.

18:21.471 --> 18:24.306
I became a war hero
and raised a family,

18:24.307 --> 18:27.976
but I was dying inside,
and the deeper I buried it,

18:27.977 --> 18:30.103
the more unhappy I became,

18:30.104 --> 18:33.065
and eventually, I even thought
of ending my own life.

18:33.066 --> 18:35.442
But I couldn't do that to Glenn.

18:35.443 --> 18:37.360
I had no idea.

18:37.361 --> 18:39.404
It's clear you had no idea.

18:39.405 --> 18:41.364
You know nothing
about what it means

18:41.365 --> 18:42.616

18:42.617 --> 18:44.534

transgender person's story,

are the price of admission

That's two inches
past your goal.

20:03.614 --> 20:05.365
It's not important
what the goal was.

20:05.366 --> 20:09.035

We didn't get to do anything.

20:35.313 --> 20:36.313
Show's 22 minutes long.

20:36.314 --> 20:37.856
Not everything
makes it to air.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.357
But, hey, you have the floor

20:39.358 --> 20:41.193
if there's something hilarious
you want to say.

20:41.194 --> 20:42.819
I'll just sit here and be quiet.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.779
Give us two Emmys worth
of amazing.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.282
Maybe a funny burger name? No?

20:47.283 --> 20:49.159
Girl in the bunny ears?

20:49.160 --> 20:51.745
Boy, I love it when characters
are expressed by props.

20:51.746 --> 20:54.289
I kind of feel like
this is less of a crossover

20:54.290 --> 20:55.749
and more of a roast.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.835
No, a roast is good-natured.

20:58.305 --> 21:04.843
