04:02.375 --> 04:04.573
Mamma.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.895
How is everyone?

04:08.575 --> 04:11.655
- And you?
- I'm fine, I already told you.

04:27.495 --> 04:30.255
Mind telling me what the fuck happened?

04:32.415 --> 04:35.855
- Blue Blood tried to kill us all.
- He's not the problem!

04:37.575 --> 04:39.415
But whoever's behind him!

04:40.735 --> 04:44.093
They were waiting for me
in that shithole.

04:44.095 --> 04:46.533
She told you
Blue Blood was there, right?

04:46.535 --> 04:48.373
So what?

04:48.375 --> 04:51.935
She doesn't know
that you're behind the bust.

04:53.095 --> 04:55.495
Or do you think I told her?

04:56.495 --> 04:59.533
We're only alive by a miracle.

04:59.535 --> 05:04.133
But not you...
You look like you've been for a stroll.

05:04.135 --> 05:07.135
Tell me to my face
if you think I tried to kill you.

05:08.935 --> 05:12.295
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be buried by now.

05:19.855 --> 05:22.613
We need to stay calm.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.653
Calm and united.

05:25.655 --> 05:28.813
We're under attack,

05:28.815 --> 05:33.135
and I want to be sure we don't have
enemies other than Blue Blood.

05:35.295 --> 05:39.415
So, Michelangelo keep
your eyes open in Secondigliano.

05:40.535 --> 05:42.615
For you and for us.

05:45.455 --> 05:47.975
There's one thing
Michelangelo's right about.

05:49.775 --> 05:54.775
We're a family
and we gotta act like a family.

05:57.175 --> 05:58.815
Understood?

06:40.735 --> 06:44.173
I handed the Levantes to you
on a silver platter,

06:44.175 --> 06:47.013
and yet they're still standing.

06:47.015 --> 06:50.173
Either they're very lucky,

06:50.175 --> 06:52.695
or they had a guardian angel.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.895
Or maybe you're useless.

06:58.975 --> 07:01.413
To see if that's true
we gotta try again.

07:01.415 --> 07:04.815
Not now. Now you need to lie low.

07:06.215 --> 07:08.775
They're after you,
they mustn't find you here.

07:11.175 --> 07:12.895
You gotta get away.

07:17.415 --> 07:20.015
Patrizia, you know why I'm here.

07:24.055 --> 07:26.893
I want revenge, too,

07:26.895 --> 07:29.853
but at the right moment.

07:29.855 --> 07:32.415
Meanwhile, we gotta keep a low profile.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.295
Understood?

07:39.575 --> 07:41.255
Now get outta here.

08:28.735 --> 08:32.695
- Where have you been?
- At Enzo's with the guys, talking.

08:36.135 --> 08:38.013
What did you have to say?

08:38.015 --> 08:40.294
For now they gotta disappear.

08:43.294 --> 08:47.975
- What does your family say?
- They suspect you too.

08:49.935 --> 08:53.493
They're not sure,
but we got a spotlight on us.

08:53.495 --> 08:55.575
We have to be careful.

09:04.415 --> 09:07.453
Truth is, while they're alive,
we're not safe.

09:07.455 --> 09:10.255
And now I gotta take
Secondigliano back.

09:17.935 --> 09:19.695
Michelangelo!

09:24.735 --> 09:27.053
Remember who we're doing it for.

09:27.055 --> 09:30.775
I know what I'm doing and who it's for,
no need to remind me.

09:34.335 --> 09:36.335
I know how you feel.

09:40.735 --> 09:43.575
But you gotta relax.

09:46.495 --> 09:49.015
So far, there are no dead to mourn.

11:09.815 --> 11:11.135
Everything okay?

11:14.295 --> 11:16.775
Speed up a little.

11:23.135 --> 11:25.535
Turn right.

11:30.975 --> 11:33.775
Patrizia, don't turn around,
we got a car tailing us.

12:00.615 --> 12:02.693
So what do I do?

12:02.695 --> 12:05.413
- We'll go home.
- Let's finish our rounds.

12:05.415 --> 12:07.535
- Patrizia...
- I said let's go.

12:29.255 --> 12:31.135
Get out, I'll be right there.

12:41.175 --> 12:44.493
Don't you dare contradict me
in front of my men ever again!

12:44.495 --> 12:46.933
I'm in charge here.

12:46.935 --> 12:51.735
I can't let them see me weak,
neither in my house nor outside it.

12:53.055 --> 12:54.973
Then excuse me.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.413
I thought I was talking to Bianca's mom,

12:57.415 --> 12:59.975
but I'm dealing with
the boss of Secondigliano.

13:57.215 --> 13:59.295
Where's my father?

14:04.535 --> 14:08.093
Papa! Why the fuck
have you got a car tailing us?

14:08.095 --> 14:10.293
Calm down, Michelangelo.

14:10.295 --> 14:13.013
You told me
to keep my eyes open and I did,

14:13.015 --> 14:15.375
but it seems you don't trust me.

14:17.175 --> 14:19.695
We've been attacked three times.

14:21.375 --> 14:24.093
Someone's gotta be behind it.

14:24.095 --> 14:27.375
Maybe it's only that little shit
from Forcella, maybe not.

14:29.975 --> 14:33.855
I watch my house and I do it well.

14:35.735 --> 14:38.695
I'm asking you, please,
you gotta trust me.

14:40.175 --> 14:42.295
You're my blood, Michelangelo.

14:45.735 --> 14:48.095
We all trust you.

15:41.855 --> 15:45.293
They confirmed, the shipment
arrives tomorrow morning.

15:45.295 --> 15:47.495
Good, I'll go.

15:51.055 --> 15:53.895
I don't like you going out on your own.

15:54.935 --> 15:57.013
Then we'll go together,

15:57.015 --> 15:59.453
that way they can't do anything to me.

15:59.455 --> 16:01.375
I'll go by myself.

16:02.655 --> 16:05.093
I need to be seen in the streets.

16:05.095 --> 16:08.093
As boss of Secondigliano
they gotta know I'm always there.

16:08.095 --> 16:10.893
If I hide like a rat, I'm nobody's boss.

16:10.895 --> 16:12.295
Patrizia...

16:16.735 --> 16:20.453
Please, listen to me.

16:20.455 --> 16:24.215
I have a bank account in Switzerland
with two million, why don't we leave?

16:25.295 --> 16:28.013
We can go and live wherever we want,

16:28.015 --> 16:30.333
far away from my family,
from all this shit.

16:30.335 --> 16:32.535
I don't want to go anywhere.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.973
My place is here.

16:35.975 --> 16:38.693
You don't get it, they want to kill you!

16:38.695 --> 16:41.533
If they want to kill me, here I am,

16:41.535 --> 16:44.055
but they'll have to make war on my turf.

16:45.175 --> 16:48.693
When you married me,
you knew who I was.

16:48.695 --> 16:50.335
Yes, I knew.

16:51.815 --> 16:53.935
Tomorrow I'm going to the delivery.

16:57.095 --> 16:59.655
If you come, good,
you've chosen our family.

17:00.695 --> 17:04.775
But if you don't come, I'm sure Papa
will be glad to have you back home.

19:47.175 --> 19:49.175
Thank you for coming.

20:01.135 --> 20:04.973
- There's problems in Bologna.
- Bologna?

20:04.975 --> 20:07.653
That's strange, I didn't hear anything.

20:07.655 --> 20:10.175
I did.

20:13.735 --> 20:16.655
- And what do I do?
- You leave in the morning.

20:17.695 --> 20:20.053
I can't tomorrow.

20:20.055 --> 20:24.253
But don't worry, I'll make some calls
and straighten it out.

20:24.255 --> 20:27.455
Some problems can
only be solved in person.

20:32.495 --> 20:34.493
I'll go,

20:34.495 --> 20:38.615
but are you sure this problem
can't be solved any other way?

20:39.615 --> 20:44.533
There are things
that people get whacked for,

20:44.535 --> 20:47.535
before they even have time to apologize.

20:49.175 --> 20:52.053
Then there are sons,

20:52.055 --> 20:56.053
who mess up again and again,

20:56.055 --> 20:58.615
but you forgive them everything
'cause they're your kids.

21:21.815 --> 21:25.533
The other night, I had
three powerful charges put in,

21:25.535 --> 21:29.373
the same stuff we use at the quarry.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.575
Her men are already here.

21:33.455 --> 21:37.615
Stand by with that gizmo,
we gonna bring the sky down.

22:16.735 --> 22:20.135
Donna Patrizia,
the shipment's arriving now.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.535
Let's go.

22:35.015 --> 22:39.013
- They're opening the gate.
- The shipment's here.

22:39.015 --> 22:41.573
- That's it, yeah?
- She's missing though.

22:41.575 --> 22:43.415
Keep your eyes peeled.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.013
C'mon, let's do it.

23:20.015 --> 23:21.735
Faster!

23:23.615 --> 23:24.935
Donna Patrizia's coming.

23:34.975 --> 23:37.135
There, she's coming.

23:48.255 --> 23:50.135
Where the fuck is she?

23:52.535 --> 23:55.735
- She's coming in, get ready.
- Today we're gonna get rid of her ass!

24:06.895 --> 24:09.815
What the fuck's going on?

24:12.415 --> 24:14.735
Police!

24:25.575 --> 24:27.053
Let's go!

24:27.055 --> 24:28.775
Calm down!

24:31.255 --> 24:33.455
Shut up!

24:35.175 --> 24:37.175
Don't push me.

24:58.095 --> 24:59.615
What happened?

25:00.615 --> 25:03.173
They arrested Patrizia.

25:03.175 --> 25:05.015
What the fuck does that mean?

25:06.015 --> 25:09.895
The cops made a raid
and got her and the shipment.

25:12.175 --> 25:14.653
It's the second time it's happened.

25:14.655 --> 25:17.855
- People in Secondigliano...
- The fuck do I care about the people?

25:24.495 --> 25:26.535
Go, Fernando, I'll call you.

26:34.295 --> 26:36.015
What's going on?

26:41.055 --> 26:43.933
Why did you make me come here?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.255
Patrizia's been arrested.

26:47.455 --> 26:48.855
What happens now?

26:54.415 --> 26:56.893
To us, nothing.

26:56.895 --> 27:00.095
You said if she went under,
she'd take us with her.

27:02.615 --> 27:05.375
And all this goes under, too?

27:09.935 --> 27:11.775
I'm handling it.

27:13.175 --> 27:15.173
Patrizia has no record,

27:15.175 --> 27:17.975
with a good lawyer
she'll be out in a couple of days.

27:21.975 --> 27:25.853
The TV news said they found
a hundredweight of cocaine.

27:25.855 --> 27:28.493
If she wants to get out now,
she just needs to talk.

27:28.495 --> 27:30.455
And you know that.

27:31.935 --> 27:33.975
A true boss never talks.

27:37.175 --> 27:39.215
My father never talked.

27:41.575 --> 27:43.895
But she's not Pietro Savastano.

27:45.015 --> 27:48.055
And if she decides to collaborate,
everything we've built collapses.

27:55.455 --> 27:58.815
Even in prison, Patrizia is
still the boss of Secondigliano.

28:00.335 --> 28:02.335
And she knows it.

28:13.655 --> 28:16.135
Santore, the cell's freed up.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.735
Turn right.

28:57.375 --> 29:00.775
Patrizia Santore, second A, cell six.

29:37.255 --> 29:38.695
Donna Patrizia...

29:41.655 --> 29:44.893
To share the cell with you
is an honor and a privilege for me.

29:44.895 --> 29:47.855
Take the more
comfortable bed, I moved.

29:52.735 --> 29:56.535
- Thank you.
- No, not those.

29:58.615 --> 30:00.455
These are better.

30:05.175 --> 30:07.775
Whatever you need, I'm at your disposal.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.775
Got a cigarette?

30:12.895 --> 30:16.855
If I may say so, smoking's not good
in your condition.

30:19.415 --> 30:21.655
Anger's even worse.

31:03.135 --> 31:05.255
She's alive, Mickey.

31:08.815 --> 31:10.855
That's what counts.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.455
Patrizia Santore.

31:31.135 --> 31:32.495
Come.

31:38.735 --> 31:40.695
What's happening?

32:30.495 --> 32:33.095
Evening, Miss Santore,
sorry it's so late.

32:38.015 --> 32:41.253
Did my lawyer get lost on the way?

32:41.255 --> 32:44.495
I thought a little chat in private
would do us good.

32:50.615 --> 32:51.935
Please.

33:17.255 --> 33:18.735
I have nothing to say.

33:21.215 --> 33:23.255
Then maybe I misunderstood.

33:24.615 --> 33:28.575
Your husband, Michelangelo Levante,
is obviously wrong.

33:30.055 --> 33:32.055
He told us about the shipment.

33:38.215 --> 33:41.813
- It's not true.
- That's what I thought, too.

33:41.815 --> 33:45.453
A husband reporting
his wife... impossible.

33:45.455 --> 33:48.693
But then he explained he feels safer
knowing you're in jail,

33:48.695 --> 33:50.815
outside he fears for your life.

33:52.255 --> 33:54.133
He was really worried.

33:54.135 --> 33:57.373
Especially after they found
enough explosives

33:57.375 --> 34:00.253
to blow up the building
where you were arrested.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.773
I told him not to worry,
we'll keep you safe.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.935
If you have anything to tell us,
we'll protect you, give you a new life...

34:10.255 --> 34:13.455
Prison's no place to raise a kid, is it?

34:15.135 --> 34:18.335
He told me you'd definitely
have something to say.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.614
All right...

34:33.094 --> 34:35.335
Obviously he was wrong.

34:37.534 --> 34:41.614
If while you think of your baby
you remember something, I'm here.

35:34.415 --> 35:36.335
Are you all right?

35:42.895 --> 35:45.215
I'm gonna be in here for a while.

35:52.575 --> 35:55.655
And I need a friend I can trust.

35:59.335 --> 36:02.855
- Are you my friend?
- I'm always at your disposal.

36:06.255 --> 36:07.735
Good.

36:08.935 --> 36:13.055
We have to let them know
I'm still in charge of Secondigliano.

36:46.255 --> 36:47.815
How are you?

36:53.135 --> 36:55.375
I didn't have any other choice.

36:57.255 --> 37:00.175
My family nearly blew you up.

37:04.335 --> 37:06.813
If it wasn't yesterday, another day,
I can't protect you two forever.

37:06.815 --> 37:10.935
- It wasn't up to you to choose.
- But it was.

37:12.175 --> 37:16.535
I chose to protect my family
and I did it the only way I knew how.

37:17.815 --> 37:19.975
Which family are you talking about?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.293
Listen to me,

37:26.295 --> 37:29.853
I can't do anything for you in here,
I can't protect you.

37:29.855 --> 37:35.255
But they won't give up,
they'll try to kill you in here too.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.255
You have to talk to him.

37:39.295 --> 37:41.655
You have to collaborate.

37:47.655 --> 37:49.535
I'm not a rat.

37:51.255 --> 37:53.335
Now get out and stay outta my sight.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.255
You can hate me if you like...

37:57.975 --> 37:59.975
but you're alive.

38:02.055 --> 38:06.815
Now it's all in your hands,
my daughter's life, too.

38:44.775 --> 38:46.533
Well?

38:46.535 --> 38:50.893
Last night a screw took Patrizia
out of her cell.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.213
She came back an hour later,
that's all we know.

38:53.215 --> 38:55.933
If she talked we'd know by now.

38:55.935 --> 39:00.373
Maybe she said no for now,
but they find ways to tempt you.

39:00.375 --> 39:05.335
The time's come to let Patrizia know
she's not alone.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.535
Let's go for a walk.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.493
You gotta do this,

39:46.495 --> 39:49.893
and make sure no one comes
from the other side.

39:49.895 --> 39:51.495
In the soup...

41:03.255 --> 41:07.293
Only by helping
the Levantes can we solve

41:07.295 --> 41:10.055
our families' problems, don't you see?

41:11.055 --> 41:12.655
Do what you gotta do.

41:23.855 --> 41:26.215
Patrizia met with Ruggieri.

41:39.175 --> 41:40.935
Is she going to collaborate?

41:42.415 --> 41:44.015
I don't know.

41:45.335 --> 41:46.935
Yes, you do.

41:49.255 --> 41:52.015
Gennaro, I've thought this through.

41:53.855 --> 41:57.255
She has every reason in the world
to talk, about the past too.

41:59.375 --> 42:03.213
I always helped her,
I put my realm in her hands.

42:03.215 --> 42:08.093
Gratitude doesn't count for fuck,
when you're desperate

42:08.095 --> 42:11.215
and when all you have to think
about is your kid's life.

42:14.775 --> 42:17.773
I know that,

42:17.775 --> 42:20.175
because I would have done
the same thing.

42:21.575 --> 42:23.973
But I can't let her

42:23.975 --> 42:27.615
destroy all our work,
all we've accomplished so far.

42:34.975 --> 42:37.215
She has to die.

42:43.255 --> 42:45.693
I told Fernando to get her a message.

42:45.695 --> 42:48.573
We got people in that prison.

42:48.575 --> 42:50.655
To put her mind at rest.

43:14.095 --> 43:16.455
Don't let her outta your sight.

43:34.415 --> 43:36.133
She's going alone.

43:36.135 --> 43:38.255
Let's go, without being seen.

44:39.775 --> 44:43.575
Sorry, Nunzia, but there was
another way to help my family.

44:47.335 --> 44:49.055
What did you think you were doing?

44:54.895 --> 44:56.775
Fucking bitch!

45:18.055 --> 45:20.135
Donna Patrizia, are you all right?

45:26.135 --> 45:30.175
Get help. Hurry!

46:26.057 --> 46:31.057
