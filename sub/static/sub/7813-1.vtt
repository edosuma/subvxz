Three

01:27.251 --> 01:31.334
Four

01:31.334 --> 01:33.209
Sit up straight

01:34.334 --> 01:36.292
Why don't you like school?

01:36.292 --> 01:39.251
I never scored 100%

01:39.251 --> 01:44.251
Sometimes I missed 2%.

01:46.209 --> 01:49.251
I never got 100%

01:49.251 --> 01:51.376
What happens when you don't get 100%?

01:51.376 --> 01:54.376
Mom and dad will be disappointed

01:54.376 --> 01:57.251
What happens when they are disappointed?

01:58.376 --> 02:03.376
I think I'm useless. No one likes me

02:06.292 --> 02:07.584
Mrs & Mr Tong,

02:07.626 --> 02:10.251
Martin might have got anxiety disorder

02:10.251 --> 02:11.334
After investigation,

02:11.334 --> 02:14.251
we suggest Martin leave the gifted class

02:14.251 --> 02:15.417
and study with regular students

02:15.417 --> 02:18.292
My son leaving the gifted class?

02:18.292 --> 02:19.459
I don't get it

02:19.501 --> 02:21.376
How possibly could my son not gifted?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.251
Well, we...

02:24.376 --> 02:27.251
This report, who wrote it?

02:29.376 --> 02:32.251
We actually asked Mrs and Mr Tong to come...

02:32.251 --> 02:35.251
and talk about Martin's rash problem. Maybe...

02:35.251 --> 02:39.251
Anita, I asked who wrote this report

02:41.251 --> 02:43.292
The report was written by the headmistress

02:43.292 --> 02:45.376
But it's just her personal opinion,

02:46.251 --> 02:47.292
which may or may not be the absolute fact

02:48.209 --> 02:51.251
Then could you ask her to explain to us in person...

02:51.251 --> 02:53.251
on what grounds she thinks

02:53.251 --> 02:55.251
Martin isn't good enough for gifted class?

03:01.251 --> 03:02.251
Headmistress

03:06.292 --> 03:09.209
You're back just in time
We're talking about Martin

03:09.209 --> 03:10.209
Headmistress

03:10.209 --> 03:13.292
Why did you give such poor grade
in my son's assessment?

03:13.292 --> 03:16.376
I know you supposed
we've been giving him too much pressure

03:16.376 --> 03:18.251
But Martin is just learning...

03:18.251 --> 03:19.751
German, Spanish

03:19.751 --> 03:21.417
ballroom dance, Chinese zither
and violin after school...

03:21.417 --> 03:24.334
all very common interest classes

03:24.334 --> 03:27.251
My friend's son has classes...

03:27.251 --> 03:30.251
all mornings and all afternoons

03:30.251 --> 03:32.334
How could Martin be under any stress?

03:36.251 --> 03:39.376
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs and Mr Tong. I'm late...

03:40.334 --> 03:43.251
because something happened at the gifted class

03:44.251 --> 03:47.417
A student locked himself up in the washroom...

03:47.417 --> 03:50.251
and banged his head against the door

03:50.251 --> 03:51.334
I was afraid he might hurt himself

03:51.334 --> 03:53.251
I had to sort it out first

03:53.251 --> 03:57.251
He then told me in tears that

03:57.251 --> 03:59.376
he didn't want to come to school anymore

04:00.292 --> 04:03.292
He said he'd rather give me $100 to score 100%

04:06.334 --> 04:09.251
Martin's case is similar

04:10.334 --> 04:12.376
I'm afraid he's the next one

04:16.250 --> 04:19.250
That's why I suggest Martin leave gifted class...

04:19.250 --> 04:20.416
and study with regular students

04:22.334 --> 04:25.251
Mrs and Mr Tong
are the co-chairmen of a listed company

04:25.251 --> 04:26.376
and are highly successful

04:26.376 --> 04:29.292
They've also supported our school generously

04:30.251 --> 04:34.292
Headmistress, let's keep Martin
in the gifted class for now

04:35.209 --> 04:36.334
That's it

04:55.334 --> 04:59.251
(Museum of History)

05:09.251 --> 05:10.334
Funny
Yes

05:10.334 --> 05:12.334
Call Paris museum

05:12.334 --> 05:15.292
Ask them if our loan request
on royal furniture is approved

05:15.292 --> 05:17.292
Sure. Boss
Thanks

05:19.209 --> 05:23.292
Boss, our budget's been on hold for over 2 months

05:23.292 --> 05:26.292
We'd run out of time to build the sets

05:29.376 --> 05:33.251
Anyway, we have everything here

05:33.251 --> 05:36.251
They did loads of research

05:36.251 --> 05:38.209
Keep working

05:38.376 --> 05:40.251
You may set up here

05:40.251 --> 05:42.251
OK. Let's start

05:42.251 --> 05:45.251
Tony, How about the French Revolution budget?

05:45.251 --> 05:48.251
My team has been preparing for months

05:48.251 --> 05:51.251
We can start right away
if I get the green light from you

05:51.251 --> 05:54.251
Dong, the management wants the budget cut

05:54.251 --> 05:56.376
and some fancy high-tech stuff

05:56.376 --> 05:58.292
I'm caught in the middle

05:59.417 --> 06:01.376
What do we do now?

06:01.376 --> 06:04.042
They make 3D projections...

06:04.084 --> 06:06.251
just like that

06:06.251 --> 06:10.251
We won't build those sets anymore
Cut corners

06:35.376 --> 06:37.251
Mr Tse
Wah

06:37.251 --> 06:39.251
Here you are
Your wife came early

06:39.251 --> 06:41.251
I've never seen her so upset...

06:41.251 --> 06:42.334
in the past 10 years

06:42.334 --> 06:44.376
Tell her a joke and she'll be fine

06:45.751 --> 06:47.626
I'm not good at telling jokes

06:47.667 --> 06:49.126
Go make up one now

07:01.667 --> 07:02.667
Happy 10th anniversary

07:02.709 --> 07:03.417
mm mm]

07:08.542 --> 07:09.459
Cheers

07:24.292 --> 07:26.251
I resigned from my job today

07:34.251 --> 07:39.251
What a coincidence. I also quitted my job today

07:47.709 --> 07:50.251
I'd work till February

07:50.251 --> 07:53.376
Then we'd live out your dreams

07:53.376 --> 07:56.251
We'd visit...

07:56.251 --> 07:59.251
the world's biggest and best museums

08:03.251 --> 08:05.417
My contract ends in 6 months...

08:05.417 --> 08:11.251
and we'd travel around the world then

08:42.251 --> 08:48.251
(Two months later)

09:07.001 --> 09:10.251
(Remember your herbal tonic)

09:18.626 --> 09:22.251
(My first day)

09:22.251 --> 09:24.334
Repeat after me

09:24.334 --> 09:26.376
A

09:26.376 --> 09:29.209
B

09:29.209 --> 09:31.251
C

09:31.251 --> 09:33.209
D

09:33.251 --> 09:40.292
Do you speak French?

09:45.251 --> 09:53.334
Two...three...four

10:46.584 --> 10:48.376
Persistent decline of birth rate in Hong Kong...

10:48.376 --> 10:51.334
has forced schools to
close down due to under-enrollment

10:51.334 --> 10:54.251
Education Bureau has announced
a series of measures

10:54.251 --> 10:57.251
More and more schools would face closure

10:57.251 --> 10:59.376
While prestigious elite schools
attract hordes of parents

10:59.376 --> 11:02.334
queuing up for application forms...

11:02.334 --> 11:05.084
many others, village schools in particular...

11:05.084 --> 11:06.376
cannot enroll enough students
and face closure

11:06.376 --> 11:09.251
I'm standing in front of Yuen Tin Kindergarten

11:09.251 --> 11:11.334
which lacks students and resources seriously

11:11.334 --> 11:14.417
The headmaster and all teachers have resigned

11:14.417 --> 11:18.376
Only 1 part-time substitute teacher
and 5 students are left here

11:18.376 --> 11:22.334
They stay because they can't afford
to switch school

11:22.334 --> 11:24.417
Recent reports also reveal...

11:24.417 --> 11:26.292
the school placed a classified ad to hire...

11:26.292 --> 11:29.292
a headmaster-cum-janitor
for $4,500 a month

11:32.292 --> 11:35.542
How can you possibly
hire a headmaster for HK$4,500?

11:35.751 --> 11:37.251
In such situation...

11:37.251 --> 11:39.376
it ain't a bad thing to close it down, right?

11:40.251 --> 11:42.084
Mister, why don't you quit this school?

11:42.084 --> 11:43.251
Don't you worry about
your grand-daughter?

11:43.251 --> 11:45.251
He's my papa

11:45.251 --> 11:46.584
Why don't you move to another school?

11:47.001 --> 11:48.334
We're broke and we don't have choices

11:48.334 --> 11:50.251
We don't pay tuition fee here

11:50.251 --> 11:52.251
Young lady, your classmates are all gone

11:52.251 --> 11:53.334
Do you feel sad?

11:53.334 --> 11:54.376
Leave us alone

11:55.251 --> 11:57.251
So, the Rural Committee decides to...

11:57.251 --> 11:59.334
close the school if there
aren't at least 5 students

11:59.334 --> 12:01.376
next school term

12:24.334 --> 12:28.084
(Yuen Tin Village, Kam Tin, Yuen Long)

12:33.251 --> 12:34.334
Madam, excuse me

12:34.334 --> 12:36.251
Do you know where...

12:36.251 --> 12:39.334
Yuen Tin Kindergarten is?

12:39.334 --> 12:42.209
It's closed down
Closed down?

12:42.209 --> 12:46.251
Are you sure? I saw it in the news just now

12:46.251 --> 12:47.251
There are only 5 students left

12:47.251 --> 12:50.126
and it's hiring a headmaster with $4,500 a month

12:50.209 --> 12:51.334
That kindergarten

12:51.334 --> 12:54.251
Even if it's in business today
it won't last till tomorrow

12:54.251 --> 12:56.084
Go straight

12:56.084 --> 12:58.042
It's the broken house above the stairs on your right

12:58.667 --> 13:00.251
Thank you

13:00.584 --> 13:04.251
Even if it's in business today
it won't last till tomorrow

14:35.292 --> 14:37.251
A bad guy

14:37.251 --> 14:40.334
Run. Let's hide

14:40.334 --> 14:43.251
Elam mm {m um

14:43.251 --> 14:46.334
Young ladies, don't be afraid
I'm not a bad guy

14:47.251 --> 14:50.251
I'm a teacher. I'm here to teach

14:50.251 --> 14:52.292
Young ladies, don't be scared

14:52.292 --> 14:55.209
Come on

14:55.209 --> 14:57.376
She is talking to us

14:57.376 --> 14:59.376
Stay quiet

15:01.001 --> 15:03.542
Young ladies, do you like going to school?

15:08.251 --> 15:09.334
How about this?

15:09.334 --> 15:12.251
I'll ask a question
and see if you know the answer

15:12.251 --> 15:16.292
Did you know how many legs a bumble bee has?

15:24.251 --> 15:26.376
I know. Six legs

15:26.376 --> 15:29.334
Six? That's correct
You're so smart

15:29.334 --> 15:31.292
A bumble bee has six legs

15:31.292 --> 15:33.376
How about another question?

15:33.376 --> 15:34.376
OK

15:34.376 --> 15:38.376
Did you know how
many legs a spider has?

15:38.376 --> 15:42.209
I know, I know.
10 legs

15:42.209 --> 15:43.334
10?

15:43.334 --> 15:45.292
I know. 4 legs

15:45.292 --> 15:46.376
4?

15:46.376 --> 15:48.376
I know. 4 legs

15:49.251 --> 15:50.376
Jennie, stop parroting me

15:50.376 --> 15:52.209
Sorry

15:52.209 --> 15:55.292
A spider has 8 legs

15:56.251 --> 15:58.376
How about one more question?

15:58.376 --> 16:00.251
OK

16:00.292 --> 16:03.584
Did anyone know...

16:03.584 --> 16:07.292
how many legs a caterpillar has?

16:07.292 --> 16:11.376
I know... I know...

16:11.376 --> 16:13.251
100 legs

16:13.251 --> 16:15.334
You're more or less right

16:17.251 --> 16:18.292
The thunder monster

16:18.292 --> 16:23.376
Chu chu, don't be scared.
We'll be with you

16:28.542 --> 16:31.334
Who are you? Which media are you from?

16:31.334 --> 16:33.376
I'm just a substitute teacher. Don't bother me

16:33.376 --> 16:35.126
No, I'm not...

16:36.084 --> 16:38.001
There's nothing to see here. Go away

16:39.126 --> 16:41.001
Please

16:42.501 --> 16:43.709
Go away

17:15.751 --> 17:17.251
I'm home

17:17.251 --> 17:20.251
Right on time. Let's eat

17:25.251 --> 17:27.416
This soup has been slow-cooked for 4 hours

17:27.416 --> 17:29.417
This rack of lamb...

17:30.709 --> 17:32.376
I marinated it for 3 hours...

17:32.376 --> 17:36.292
and fried it over low heat with all my heart

17:37.251 --> 17:39.251
Try it, try it

17:42.251 --> 17:43.251
How's it?

18:00.251 --> 18:02.292
Do you have something to tell me?

18:08.251 --> 18:11.376
This kindergarten in Yuen Long
is left with only 5 broke students

18:12.292 --> 18:13.459
Have you been following this?

18:13.459 --> 18:16.376
Yes I have. The school is closing down...

18:16.376 --> 18:19.292
and wants to hire a headmaster for $4500 a month

18:20.292 --> 18:22.417
This classified ad has been placed for 2 months

18:22.417 --> 18:24.292
without a single reply

18:24.292 --> 18:27.251
Who on earth will take a headmaster job
for $4,500 a month?

18:27.334 --> 18:29.334
It has to close down

18:29.334 --> 18:31.376
if there aren't at least 5 students
by the end of the school term

18:32.292 --> 18:34.417
Children need schooling

18:34.417 --> 18:38.251
Whatever the reason
they should not be forsaken

18:40.667 --> 18:42.251
Why don't we help them out?

18:42.251 --> 18:44.334
It breaks my heart to see them that way

18:48.126 --> 18:49.584
It's March now

18:49.584 --> 18:51.334
The school term will be over in 4 months

18:52.251 --> 18:53.542
My only goal is...

18:53.542 --> 18:56.376
to help them move to better schools

18:58.251 --> 18:59.376
Isn't that straight forward?

19:00.251 --> 19:01.251
Yes it is

19:02.334 --> 19:04.667
But I'm worried about your health

19:04.667 --> 19:07.126
You just had your tumor surgically removed

19:07.126 --> 19:11.251
Oh, don't be
I got nothing else to do anyway

19:11.251 --> 19:14.709
Just 4 months
Your contract ends in July

19:14.709 --> 19:17.001
We can still travel around the world as planned

19:18.292 --> 19:19.459
Do you support my decision?

19:20.584 --> 19:22.292
You've made up your mind anyway

19:25.542 --> 19:32.751
(Yuen Tin Village Office)

19:37.709 --> 19:39.126
Have a drink

19:39.126 --> 19:41.001
Thank you, madam

19:52.334 --> 19:56.584
Ms Lui, we can only afford $4500 a month

19:58.251 --> 19:59.292
I know

20:00.251 --> 20:03.251
As we're running out of cash

20:03.251 --> 20:07.251
you'd have to take care of cleaning...

20:07.251 --> 20:12.292
general maintenance and other odd jobs

20:13.251 --> 20:15.584
Chairman, I understand

20:15.584 --> 20:17.334
There'll only be me...

20:17.334 --> 20:19.376
and I have to teach 3 classes

20:20.251 --> 20:23.376
This school has 50 years of history

20:23.376 --> 20:26.376
having helped many families in this community

20:26.376 --> 20:29.251
Now the government
doesn't spare us much resource

20:29.251 --> 20:31.334
Rural Committee
doesn't want us to carry on either

20:31.334 --> 20:35.292
There are only 5 students...

20:35.292 --> 20:37.376
and one of them will graduate this year

20:37.376 --> 20:41.251
If there aren't at least 5 students
enrolled after summer

20:41.251 --> 20:43.334
I'm afraid we'd have to close down

20:44.251 --> 20:46.667
Have you tried recruiting students?

20:47.292 --> 20:51.126
We have. But no one comes

20:51.667 --> 20:54.292
You know, with the media
portraying us in a negative light

20:54.292 --> 20:56.376
people assume we'd close down
sooner or later

20:58.001 --> 20:59.084
Not much we can do

22:00.001 --> 22:06.667
(4 months before the end of school term)

22:24.667 --> 22:27.667
I heard the Headmistress
used to teach in an elite school

22:27.667 --> 22:31.209
Working for $4500 a month?
She just wants to be famous

22:31.209 --> 22:33.334
With her alone...

22:33.334 --> 22:36.751
how can she teach three classes all at once?

22:45.667 --> 22:47.292
I'm Fung Tai-wai

22:47.292 --> 22:49.376
the newly elected chairman of
Yuen Tin Village Rural Committee

22:50.334 --> 22:53.209
You're the 4500-dollar headmistress

22:53.209 --> 22:54.251
Let me tell you

22:54.251 --> 22:56.251
Our committee already made the decision

22:56.251 --> 22:57.417
If there are less than
5 students next year

22:57.417 --> 22:59.334
This school will have
to be closed down

23:01.251 --> 23:03.167
Don't you have better things to do?

23:09.459 --> 23:11.251
We'll be there soon

23:19.251 --> 23:21.001
OK, go to school

23:22.376 --> 23:25.251
Good morning. I'm the new Headmistress
I'm Lui Wai-hung

23:26.001 --> 23:27.251
Good morning, Headmistress

23:28.251 --> 23:32.334
Remember. Listen to Headmistress
Learn a few more words

23:33.209 --> 23:35.001
I will Papa

23:35.251 --> 23:37.126
Bye
BYE Papa

23:37.126 --> 23:38.251
Be good

23:38.251 --> 23:39.376
Bye
Bye

23:45.459 --> 23:47.001
Good morning

23:52.459 --> 23:53.376
Good morning

23:54.001 --> 23:55.334
Bye Auntie Han

23:56.251 --> 23:58.292
Auntie Han, I'm the new Headmistress
I'm Lui Wai-hung

23:58.292 --> 23:59.292
I'm in a hurry

23:59.292 --> 24:01.459
I have to rush back to the restaurant
to wash dishes. I can't talk

24:07.126 --> 24:09.251
Ka-ka, don't run so fast

24:11.251 --> 24:14.251
Good morning, I'm the new Headmistress
I'm Lui Wai-hung

24:14.251 --> 24:16.167
Hello Headmistress
Hello

24:16.667 --> 24:18.126
Be a good girl, okay?

24:30.667 --> 24:32.251
Give me a discount, will you?

24:32.251 --> 24:34.042
Madam, please don't negotiate with me

24:34.459 --> 24:36.334
just pay the taxi fare

24:40.251 --> 24:41.292
Good morning
Good morning

24:41.292 --> 24:43.292
I'm the new Headmistress
I'm Lui Wai-hung

24:43.292 --> 24:44.334
How're you?

24:44.334 --> 24:47.001
Even if it's still in business today
it won't last till tomorrow

25:02.292 --> 25:04.209
Good morning, class

25:04.209 --> 25:05.417
Good morning

25:05.709 --> 25:10.292
I'm your new Headmistress

25:10.292 --> 25:12.417
My name is Lui Wai-hung

25:13.251 --> 25:15.751
Did you remember I came to visit you
some days ago?

25:15.751 --> 25:17.292
Yes, we do

25:17.292 --> 25:19.251
Really? You're smart kids

25:19.251 --> 25:21.251
Now look at me

25:21.251 --> 25:23.251
Let me ask you one more question, OK?

25:23.251 --> 25:24.251
OK

25:24.334 --> 25:28.251
Do I look better with the mask or...

25:28.251 --> 25:30.251
without the mask?

25:30.251 --> 25:32.334
Without the mask

25:32.334 --> 25:35.251
Really? Without?

25:35.251 --> 25:37.292
If I look better without the mask

25:37.292 --> 25:40.334
you'll also look better without it

25:40.334 --> 25:44.251
No. Papa said people
will recognize my face

25:44.251 --> 25:48.251
and label me the poor kid
without the mask

25:48.251 --> 25:51.251
and I won't have a future

25:51.251 --> 25:54.584
My dad told us not to
let others see our face

25:58.667 --> 26:01.251
Actually I was afraid that
people would recognize me

26:01.251 --> 26:03.251
and make fun of me...

26:03.251 --> 26:07.209
for teaching at a kindergarten
about to close down

26:07.209 --> 26:08.251
But I now that I think about it

26:08.251 --> 26:10.292
I get to see...

26:10.292 --> 26:12.251
5 adorable young ladies every day

26:12.251 --> 26:14.209
I don't feel inferior at all

26:14.209 --> 26:15.251
I'm not afraid of people recognizing me

26:15.251 --> 26:17.376
I don't need to wear a mask to school

26:17.667 --> 26:20.667
You too. Don't be afraid

26:20.667 --> 26:23.376
You don't need the masks

26:23.667 --> 26:25.001
How about this?

26:25.001 --> 26:28.251
I'll do the roll call

26:28.251 --> 26:30.251
When I call out your name

26:30.251 --> 26:33.376
just take the mask off
and say "present" loudly. OK?

26:33.376 --> 26:34.667
OK

26:34.709 --> 26:38.209
Let's start with Ho Siu-shet
on my right

26:38.209 --> 26:39.251
Ho Siu-shet

26:43.084 --> 26:44.376
-Present
-Good girl

26:45.167 --> 26:46.417
Kitty Fathima

26:48.126 --> 26:49.251
Present

26:49.251 --> 26:51.334
Jennie Fathima

26:53.251 --> 26:54.334
Present

26:54.334 --> 26:56.251
Tam Mei-chu

26:58.251 --> 26:59.292
Present

27:00.251 --> 27:01.334
Lo Ka-ka

27:03.667 --> 27:04.501
Present

27:05.209 --> 27:07.251
I want to take a picture of each of you...

27:07.251 --> 27:09.251
and want to know more about you

27:09.251 --> 27:12.251
How about this?
When you come out for your picture...

27:12.251 --> 27:15.251
tell me one thing
that you're most happy about...

27:15.251 --> 27:18.209
and one that upsets you most. OK?

27:18.209 --> 27:19.251
OK

27:22.251 --> 27:24.209
I'm most happy that...

27:24.209 --> 27:26.292
Papa sold some extra scrap metal...

27:26.292 --> 27:28.251
and made extra money yesterday

27:28.251 --> 27:33.251
I'm most upset when I miss my mom

27:33.251 --> 27:35.751
I only get to see her only once
in a long while

27:36.292 --> 27:38.376
I'm most happy
to get a ride on mini school bus

27:38.376 --> 27:42.334
I'm most upset
when my little sister parrots me

27:42.334 --> 27:45.251
I'm most happy
to get a ride on mini school bus

27:45.251 --> 27:49.334
I'm most upset
when my big sister shuts me up

27:58.667 --> 28:01.292
Headmistress, I don't have anything to say

28:03.667 --> 28:07.667
I'm most happy when Auntie Han
buys me steamed sponge cake

28:07.667 --> 28:10.001
What upsets you most?

28:12.251 --> 28:16.376
I'm most upset
when the thunder monster eats people

28:25.001 --> 28:26.459
Young ladies, that's it for today

28:30.667 --> 28:32.542
And to guardians and parents...

28:32.584 --> 28:35.334
the children don't need to wear a mask
to school from now on

28:35.334 --> 28:36.376
Thank you

28:40.292 --> 28:42.001
Auntie Han?

28:42.001 --> 28:43.251
What's the matter, Headmistress?

28:43.251 --> 28:45.251
I need to rush back to work
Let's talk tomorrow

28:45.251 --> 28:47.251
lt just takes a minute

28:47.251 --> 28:49.292
I have something important to ask you

28:50.667 --> 28:54.251
Chu-chu, I have to talk to Auntie Han

28:54.251 --> 28:57.001
You go over there and play. OK?

28:57.542 --> 28:58.376
Good girl

29:02.251 --> 29:05.376
What exactly is "the thunder monster"?

29:10.292 --> 29:12.376
Chu's father is my fourth cousin

29:16.251 --> 29:17.376
A few months ago...

29:18.334 --> 29:21.376
on a stormy night with thunder and lightning...

29:23.667 --> 29:25.334
Her parents were killed in a car crash

29:28.334 --> 29:30.376
Chu's such a poor girl...

29:30.376 --> 29:33.251
Chu's such a poor girl
and I'm all alone anyway

29:33.251 --> 29:34.376
So I look after her

29:36.667 --> 29:40.292
But she keeps asking where her parents went

29:41.376 --> 29:44.209
Were they eaten by the thunder monster?

29:44.292 --> 29:46.334
And she drew her parents on the wall

29:47.376 --> 29:49.376
I never went to school

29:50.251 --> 29:53.209
Tell me, how do I answer her?

30:00.251 --> 30:03.334
Auntie Han, it must've been hard for you

30:06.542 --> 30:12.001
Maybe you can hold Chu-chu
in your arms more often

30:13.209 --> 30:15.251
She'd feel more secure that way

30:18.334 --> 30:21.251
I can't talk any more. I have to work

30:21.251 --> 30:23.376
Chu, we got to go

30:24.251 --> 30:25.334
Come on

31:11.667 --> 31:13.376
Mommy

31:19.292 --> 31:21.334
I'm so sorry I'm late

31:21.334 --> 31:23.251
I walked here all the way from home

31:23.251 --> 31:26.334
You walked here? You live very far away

31:26.334 --> 31:28.292
The mini school bus increases its fare

31:28.292 --> 31:30.251
We can't afford it anymore

31:30.251 --> 31:31.292
Let's go

31:32.626 --> 31:33.584
Actually, I have a car

31:33.584 --> 31:36.376
How about I give you a ride home?
It's on my way

31:56.334 --> 31:58.376
Headmistress, I'm sorry

31:58.376 --> 32:01.667
But I think Kitty and Jennie
won't come to school from tomorrow on

32:01.709 --> 32:03.001
Why?

32:03.334 --> 32:05.334
We can't afford the bus fare

32:05.334 --> 32:08.542
Their father said girls don't need education...

32:08.584 --> 32:10.709
and told them to help with the chores at home

32:11.292 --> 32:13.251
I'm sorry, Headmistress

32:24.292 --> 32:26.334
Say bye-bye to Headmistress

32:28.251 --> 32:30.084
Come on, be a good girl

32:30.251 --> 32:34.376
Goodbye, Headmistress...

32:34.376 --> 32:36.292
Come on, let's go

32:36.292 --> 32:39.084
We'd go back to work. Quick

32:55.667 --> 32:57.251
Sorry

33:36.292 --> 33:38.334
Headmistress

33:39.251 --> 33:41.251
Jennie, Kitty, from tomorrow on...

33:41.251 --> 33:43.251
I'll be your mini school bus driver

33:43.251 --> 33:45.251
I'll drive you to school and back home. OK?

33:45.251 --> 33:47.251
<i>Hurray, Hurray</i>

33:53.251 --> 33:55.251
Headmistress, you really don't have to...

33:55.251 --> 33:58.334
That's OK. It's on my way to school anyway

33:58.376 --> 34:00.376
Thank you so much, Headmistress

34:01.667 --> 34:03.251
This is my husband

34:03.251 --> 34:04.084
Nice meeting you

34:10.251 --> 34:12.667
May, any good news?

34:13.251 --> 34:16.251
Wai-hung, I'm afraid I can't help
I've talked to my school...

34:16.251 --> 34:17.333
I know they have financial problems

34:17.333 --> 34:19.292
But it's not realistic to ask a school...

34:19.292 --> 34:21.667
to waive their tuition
and sponsor their transportation...

34:21.667 --> 34:23.251
books and stationery

34:23.251 --> 34:26.376
I know. I really understand
But please try anyway

34:26.376 --> 34:30.251
How about this?
You just accept one student. Just one

34:30.376 --> 34:32.376
I'm sorry

34:32.667 --> 34:34.376
Wai-hung, I appreciate what you do

34:34.376 --> 34:37.292
I've read about you
the 4500-dollar Headmistress on daily papers

34:37.292 --> 34:41.001
Keep it up
I'll let you know once I got any news

34:42.376 --> 34:43.667
OK then...

34:44.583 --> 34:46.292
please let me know when you got any news

34:46.292 --> 34:49.292
Thanks and sorry for the trouble. Bye

34:53.001 --> 34:54.333
The odds are 2 to 1 if it closes down in 1 month

34:54.333 --> 34:57.334
4 to 1 in 2 months, 6 to 1 in 3 months...

34:57.334 --> 35:00.334
8 to 1 in 4 months, 10 to 1 in 5 months

35:01.292 --> 35:03.376
What? Half a month?

35:03.667 --> 35:06.459
Only 1.5 to 1 for half a month

35:07.126 --> 35:09.334
You're still betting on half a month? OK

35:10.251 --> 35:13.251
Cheung placed $500
on the school closing in half a month

35:13.251 --> 35:15.209
Hold on. I place $1,000 for half a month

35:15.209 --> 35:16.251
$1000...

35:16.251 --> 35:19.376
Skinny...Go change the odds. Or I'm losing big

35:35.251 --> 35:37.251
Just 3 students today?

35:37.251 --> 35:41.251
I told you it won't last

35:43.001 --> 35:48.126
When Grocer Wong set the odds
I placed big bets on you...

35:48.126 --> 35:49.667
expecting the school to hang in there
for 2 months

35:49.667 --> 35:51.542
Who knows it's closing down so soon?

36:45.667 --> 36:47.584
Keung, no. Stop it
Let go

36:48.251 --> 36:50.376
Let me tell you, jerk
Don't even try to threaten me

36:50.376 --> 36:52.376
We lived here for generations
I'm not selling the house

36:52.376 --> 36:55.251
Mr Lo, you might as well think about it

36:55.251 --> 36:57.251
Think about what? Get the hell out

36:58.376 --> 37:00.376
No, Keung. Stop it

37:00.376 --> 37:04.334
Easy, easy. Listen to me first

37:04.334 --> 37:07.209
This is the last house unsold
in the neighbourhood

37:07.251 --> 37:08.251
What do you mean, last house?

37:08.251 --> 37:10.334
Let me tell you. I lost a leg...

37:10.334 --> 37:12.251
but I have both hands still

37:12.251 --> 37:13.251
Go. Go

37:13.251 --> 37:14.251
I'll risk my life for it

37:14.251 --> 37:17.001
No. No.
I dare you to come again

37:18.667 --> 37:21.126
Headmistress... how're you?
Mrs Lo

37:22.334 --> 37:25.001
This is the new Headmistress of the kindergarten

37:26.126 --> 37:27.376
Headmistress and so?

37:42.251 --> 37:45.001
Is there anything I can help you with?

37:46.376 --> 37:50.251
What can you help me with? We need no help

37:52.334 --> 37:55.251
Ka-ka didn't come to school today

37:55.251 --> 37:56.251
I'm worried about her

37:56.251 --> 37:59.626
So I drop by to see how's she's doing

38:00.251 --> 38:03.334
Education is very important to children

38:05.584 --> 38:07.251
What did you mean?

38:08.126 --> 38:10.001
You mean I kept her home from school?

38:10.251 --> 38:14.251
She didn't want to go. Don't accuse me

38:29.667 --> 38:31.209
Ka-ka

38:34.251 --> 38:37.417
Tell me. Why aren't you going to school?

38:45.251 --> 38:49.251
I have to stay and watch my mama and papa

38:49.251 --> 38:52.292
So, I can't go to school

38:52.292 --> 38:58.209
I'm afraid they'd fight when I'm gone

38:58.209 --> 39:04.209
They may kill each other
and I won't see them again

39:07.667 --> 39:13.334
Then I'll be all alone

39:13.334 --> 39:16.376
I'll miss them

39:39.251 --> 39:44.334
Silly, papa cannot work due to his leg injury

39:44.334 --> 39:49.292
He is just in the bad mood, we will be fine

39:54.251 --> 39:55.334
Ka-ka

39:56.251 --> 39:58.084
Tell mama, papa or me...

39:58.126 --> 40:02.251
what you think next time, OK?

40:06.209 --> 40:10.251
Mama and papa won't fight in front of you again

40:10.376 --> 40:14.251
You can go to school without worries

40:15.334 --> 40:17.417
Right? Mrs and Mr Lo?

41:46.251 --> 41:47.251
5 pounds. 30 bucks

41:47.251 --> 41:51.292
There're <i>7</i> pounds
You always cheat my papa You cheater

41:54.334 --> 41:57.376
Don't be so mean to a child
Give her 40 bucks

42:44.542 --> 42:47.376
Mr Ho, Siu-shet,
this is the Headmistress

42:47.376 --> 42:51.334
I come here for home visit

43:04.251 --> 43:07.292
Headmistress, here's your tea

43:07.292 --> 43:10.334
Papa's sick and he's asleep

43:10.334 --> 43:13.251
Please sit here and wait

43:34.251 --> 43:38.376
(I don't know when mama will come)

44:28.334 --> 44:32.292
Headmistress, it's hot and dirty in the kitchen

44:32.292 --> 44:34.376
Please sit and wait outside

44:39.334 --> 44:42.292
Siu-shet is such a good girl

44:50.251 --> 44:51.667
Headmistress, you're here

44:51.709 --> 44:53.251
Papa

44:58.209 --> 45:02.376
My apology. I'm not feeling well today...

45:03.334 --> 45:08.251
and Siu-shet wanted to stay at home
to take care of me

45:09.251 --> 45:10.417
She's such a good girl

45:14.251 --> 45:17.251
I used to be an interior decor worker

45:18.251 --> 45:22.584
Now that I'm old and slow

45:23.251 --> 45:25.251
no one wants me any more

45:27.667 --> 45:30.251
But I didn't apply for social security

45:30.251 --> 45:32.376
I scavenge for scrap metal to make money

45:33.334 --> 45:36.251
Still manage to pay for food

45:37.292 --> 45:40.251
Siu-shet told me...

45:41.292 --> 45:45.376
papa, I'll learn more words in class...

45:47.251 --> 45:50.376
and write more letters to mama for you

45:54.292 --> 45:58.251
I was so touched

46:00.251 --> 46:02.417
My girl has been a good kid since little

46:05.667 --> 46:08.376
Her mother lives with her brother in China

46:10.209 --> 46:13.251
We've waited for years...

46:13.251 --> 46:15.292
and don't know when we'd live together

46:18.251 --> 46:21.251
Siu-shet misses her mom a lot

46:23.334 --> 46:25.334
What should I do?

46:37.251 --> 46:39.251
Let's give it some time. Mr Ho

46:39.251 --> 46:40.584
there must be a way out

46:44.251 --> 46:48.292
Oh, by the way
I have a favour to ask of you

46:48.292 --> 46:50.251
I need something fixed

46:50.667 --> 46:52.251
What's that?

46:52.667 --> 46:55.334
The metal gate at the kindergarten

46:55.334 --> 46:57.251
It's dangerous and
hasn't been repaired for years.

46:57.251 --> 46:59.376
I want you to fix it

47:00.251 --> 47:05.292
That gate is too old to be fixed. So busted

47:07.209 --> 47:09.376
How about I replace it with a new one?

47:11.334 --> 47:13.251
But the school...

47:13.251 --> 47:16.417
can only afford $1,000. Is that OK?

47:16.667 --> 47:18.292
It won't cost $1,000

47:18.292 --> 47:22.251
I have much scrap metal
It saves you the material cost

47:23.667 --> 47:25.251
Thank you

47:25.251 --> 47:26.334
That's a deal

47:26.334 --> 47:29.251
Headmistress, papa, let's eat

47:29.251 --> 47:31.376
Whoa, look at that

47:32.334 --> 47:35.084
You made two dishes. Such a chef

47:36.584 --> 47:39.251
And lettuce too

47:39.251 --> 47:43.292
Siu-shet, papa's going to
make a new gate for the kindergarten

47:43.292 --> 47:44.251
How about that?

47:44.251 --> 47:48.334
Really? Papa is the best

47:49.542 --> 47:53.251
You are the best. Let's eat

47:55.209 --> 47:56.251
Bon appetite

48:03.001 --> 48:04.292
Young ladies...

48:04.292 --> 48:09.292
I'm introducing a new friend today

48:11.334 --> 48:14.292
Whoa, so cute

48:14.292 --> 48:18.251
His name is Little Black Bean

48:18.251 --> 48:20.251
Do you want to touch him?
Yes

48:20.251 --> 48:22.001
Let's give him a pat
Yes

48:22.001 --> 48:25.001
Though he's not the biggest or
strongest guy in the forest,
and the fellows often make fun of him

48:25.001 --> 48:27.334
He believes in the
almighty power of dreams

48:27.334 --> 48:29.251
He lives out his dream at last,

48:29.251 --> 48:32.251
being a tall big three that
protects the forest

48:32.251 --> 48:35.209
Little Black Bean has his dream,
Do you have dreams?

48:35.209 --> 48:37.209
I do

48:37.209 --> 48:38.376
What's your dream, Jennie?

48:38.376 --> 48:41.251
-To be a princess
-A princess?

48:41.334 --> 48:44.334
Because I want to wear beautiful dresses

48:44.459 --> 48:46.417
Kitty, how about you?

48:46.417 --> 48:49.251
My dream is to wash bean sprouts

48:49.251 --> 48:51.292
My dream is to wash bean sprouts too

48:51.292 --> 48:52.334
Why?

48:52.334 --> 48:57.209
Because I don't want to leave my family

48:58.001 --> 48:59.667
Siu-shet, how about you? What's your dream?

48:59.667 --> 49:02.251
My dream is to do my homework

49:02.292 --> 49:03.542
Why?

49:03.542 --> 49:07.334
Papa said I'll be a useful person in future...

49:07.334 --> 49:11.376
if I learn more and do my homework

49:13.584 --> 49:15.376
Chu-chu, what's your dream?

49:16.251 --> 49:18.334
My dream is to work in a restaurant

49:19.251 --> 49:21.251
Why?

49:22.251 --> 49:25.251
So that I can help Auntie Han with her dishes

49:25.251 --> 49:27.334
Chu-chu is such a good girl

49:30.667 --> 49:32.667
Ka-ka, what's your dream?

49:32.667 --> 49:35.292
Headmistress, I can't think of one yet

49:37.667 --> 49:41.584
Headmistress, what's your dream?

49:50.667 --> 49:52.334
We have an assignment

49:52.334 --> 49:55.292
and have to ask mama and papa
what their dreams are

49:55.292 --> 49:58.251
Papa, what's your dream?

49:58.667 --> 50:00.584
Auntie Han, what's your dream?

50:00.584 --> 50:02.376
Dream? I don't have one

50:02.376 --> 50:05.376
I'm happy if I finish work early
go home and sleep

50:06.251 --> 50:08.251
You must have one. Tell me. Tell me...

50:08.251 --> 50:10.376
I have no dream. Stop bugging me

50:11.001 --> 50:12.251
Papa

50:12.667 --> 50:13.542
Hmmm?

50:13.542 --> 50:15.501
What's your dream?

50:17.334 --> 50:19.251
Why did you ask?

50:19.251 --> 50:21.376
Mama, what's your dream?

50:22.251 --> 50:25.251
I don't have a dream. Don't wake your dad

50:27.334 --> 50:29.251
Dreams only exist in your sleep

50:30.251 --> 50:34.251
What did your headmistress teach you?

50:34.251 --> 50:35.376
To be a dreamer?

50:40.417 --> 50:46.251
Tell me... tell me...

50:47.251 --> 50:48.292
OK, Chu-chu

50:51.292 --> 50:56.584
I'll tell you
if you promise not to say it out loud

50:56.584 --> 51:01.251
It's an assignment from school
What's your dream?

51:03.667 --> 51:07.292
Mama, tell me. I want to know

51:30.292 --> 51:32.251
Hey. I'll tell you

51:33.667 --> 51:37.292
Papa had a dream too

51:41.292 --> 51:46.251
I wanted to be an athlete

51:46.667 --> 51:48.376
A runner

51:49.251 --> 51:52.292
A fast runner

51:53.209 --> 51:54.376
The world's fastest runner

52:00.376 --> 52:04.334
Long long ago, I wanted to be a pilot

52:05.209 --> 52:07.209
Huh? A pilot?

52:25.292 --> 52:27.334
My dream was to be...

52:30.251 --> 52:32.292
a firefighter

52:32.292 --> 52:35.251
A firefighter?

52:54.251 --> 52:56.084
My dream was...

52:56.667 --> 52:58.251
to be Miss Hong Kong

52:58.251 --> 52:59.376
Huh? Miss Hong Kong

53:00.292 --> 53:02.292
Hush! You promised to stay silent

53:49.667 --> 53:53.584
Auntie Han, you're the most beautiful
Miss Hong Kong in the world

53:58.251 --> 53:59.334
Thank you

54:14.251 --> 54:18.209
Hurray. Mama is so cool

54:20.251 --> 54:24.251
Happy? Isn't that great?

54:24.251 --> 54:25.376
You're so great

54:37.084 --> 54:40.001
(Lo Keung, an athlete)

55:10.084 --> 55:12.667
How tall is a life-size guillotine, you think?

55:12.667 --> 55:14.667
4 metres, I suppose

55:24.751 --> 55:27.417
(Wai-hung, no matter how many people object to it)

55:27.417 --> 55:31.584
(I'll build a life-size guillotine. I'll give my best)

55:53.292 --> 55:56.251
Headmistress, I need to use the washroom

55:56.251 --> 55:58.376
Me too... me too...

56:00.667 --> 56:02.667
Let's get in there. Quick

56:03.292 --> 56:06.334
Headmistress, what should we do?

56:14.251 --> 56:17.251
Young ladies, it's time to show our team spirit

56:17.251 --> 56:19.251
I'll take you to the public washroom
in the village, OK?

56:19.251 --> 56:20.292
OK

56:23.209 --> 56:27.334
Headmistress, keep going...

56:27.334 --> 56:31.292
Be careful. Watch your steps. It's slippery

56:32.251 --> 56:36.292
Headmistress, keep going...

56:44.667 --> 56:46.209
The thunder monster

56:46.209 --> 56:48.251
Chu-chu, wait for me

56:48.251 --> 56:50.334
Chu-chu, don't be scared of the thunder monster

56:51.251 --> 56:52.334
Watch out, Chu-chu

56:52.334 --> 56:54.001
Help...

56:57.251 --> 56:59.251
You girls wait here

57:03.292 --> 57:06.251
Chu-chu, don't be scared. I'm here

57:06.251 --> 57:09.251
The thunder monster ate my papa and mama

57:14.292 --> 57:17.251
Chu-chu, I know you're afraid

57:17.251 --> 57:19.334
but thunder isn't a monster

57:23.251 --> 57:25.334
Papa and mama... are they dead?

57:31.251 --> 57:33.376
Chu-chu must miss papa and mama a lot

57:35.334 --> 57:38.251
Chu-chu must miss papa and mama a lot

57:38.292 --> 57:41.376
but they can't come and see you now

57:43.292 --> 57:47.292
<i>They miss Chu-chu</i> as <i>much</i> as <i>you miss them</i>

58:02.334 --> 58:04.251
Chu-chu, see?

58:07.667 --> 58:10.501
I'm not eaten by any monster, right?

58:10.501 --> 58:12.334
I'm fine

58:18.334 --> 58:21.376
Thunder and rain...

58:21.376 --> 58:24.334
are the way papa and mama tell you...

58:24.334 --> 58:26.417
how much they miss you

58:26.667 --> 58:28.292
You see?

58:30.667 --> 58:32.251
Come with me

58:43.251 --> 58:44.334
Try it yourself

58:55.334 --> 58:58.376
Be happy in heaven

58:59.251 --> 59:02.376
Papa, mama, don't worry about me

59:02.376 --> 59:05.376
I will take good care of myself

59:47.251 --> 59:48.376
Dr Leung's office

59:48.376 --> 59:53.251
Hi, I want to make an appointment for a checkup

59:53.251 --> 59:56.251
Dr Leung will be away for one week

59:56.251 --> 59:59.001
Can you come at 3pm today?

59:59.292 --> 01:00:01.292
No. I'm sorry. I can't

01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:03.001
Wait...

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:08.251
how about 11am or 4pm tomorrow?

01:00:08.251 --> 01:00:12.417
11am...4pm...Sorry. I can't either

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:15.376
Well, if anyone cancels the booking
I'll inform you immediately

01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:20.251
Well, I'll wait till Dr Leung comes back then

01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:22.376
Thank you. Bye
OK, bye

01:00:31.209 --> 01:00:32.251
Ban idling vehicle

01:00:33.209 --> 01:00:35.251
We received report
about illegal dumping here

01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:38.001
Why are you pouring earth at people's door?

01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:44.251
Who is it?

01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:46.251
I'm here for Mr Lo

01:00:47.376 --> 01:00:49.251
Mr Lo, my name is Leung

01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:50.376
I'm district council members' assistant

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:52.376
The headmistress told us about your work accident...

01:00:52.376 --> 01:00:55.292
and being harassed by a developer

01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.376
May I come inside to talk to you?

01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:00.251
Thank you

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:02.251
Come to police station with us, let's go

01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:14.334
(1 month before the end of school term)

01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:20.251
Quick. Come on quick

01:01:20.251 --> 01:01:22.376
Don't go too far kids

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:25.251
Stay together. Slowly

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:28.417
Chu-chu, this way

01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:34.292
ls there a vacant table?

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.251
Keep going. What're you looking at?

01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:44.251
Let's go that way
The loser won't get her slice of cake

01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:47.251
School picnic with only 5 students

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:49.376
Get set, go

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:52.251
Be quick, Chu-chu

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:57.376
Come on... Faster...

01:02:00.334 --> 01:02:06.251
Yeah, we win

01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:31.376
You should celebrate while you can

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:35.251
I feel so happy for you when I see your faces

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:37.376
I'm not sure if the Chairman hasn't told you...

01:02:37.376 --> 01:02:39.376
or you're being forgetful

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:41.251
One student will graduate this year...

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:43.251
and there won't be 5 students in the coming term

01:02:43.251 --> 01:02:45.334
So, the Rural Committee won't sponsor
the school any more

01:02:45.334 --> 01:02:48.376
meaning you're closing down in one month

01:02:48.376 --> 01:02:50.376
You might as well be happy until then

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:55.251
Am I right, 4500-dollar headmistress?

01:03:15.251 --> 01:03:18.251
Excuse me. Can you pass me the ball please?

01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:32.292
Thank you

01:03:33.334 --> 01:03:36.209
Would you play with us?

01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:37.251
Sure

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:44.251
Yay

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:01.251
Hello. I'm Ying-lan

01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:05.292
I read about you on the papers

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:07.001
I really appreciate what you do

01:04:09.334 --> 01:04:12.334
These kids are so lucky

01:04:12.334 --> 01:04:14.292
with a good teacher...

01:04:14.292 --> 01:04:18.334
who changes their life at such an early age

01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:25.376
Too bad I can't afford to give them the best

01:04:25.376 --> 01:04:28.251
The best?
You're the best they could ever have

01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:32.334
The best education doesn't lie in the hardware

01:04:32.334 --> 01:04:35.334
but in the teacher's heart

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:41.667
It's fate that makes you cross their paths

01:04:41.667 --> 01:04:45.334
You're meant to be their teacher
and you'd do it well

01:04:50.334 --> 01:04:51.376
Thank you

01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:53.376
Don't give up

01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:43.667
Student recruitment?

01:05:43.709 --> 01:05:46.459
I have much confidence. Please let me try

01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:48.126
Since I can't move them to another school

01:05:48.126 --> 01:05:49.334
Let's try recruiting new students

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:52.376
OK, I support

01:05:57.751 --> 01:06:00.751
(Bowie Chin, CEO, Best and Marvelous Education)

01:06:06.209 --> 01:06:08.376
Headmaster Chin, it's Lui Wai-hung

01:06:08.376 --> 01:06:10.251
Do you remember me?

01:06:11.251 --> 01:06:12.334
<i>Hey, Headmistress Lui</i>

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:15.209
How's everything? It's been a while

01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:19.376
Whoa, you're famous now
I read about you on every paper

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:22.376
4500-dollar headmistress in a village school

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:25.209
The perfect PR stunt

01:06:25.209 --> 01:06:27.667
Do you want to join my company?
We can work something out

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:32.251
I remember you told me
about those education funds

01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:36.251
I want to apply for subsidies
to help those students in our kindergarten

01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:39.376
Whoa, Headmistress Lui
you're a superhero in the education system

01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:43.001
Don't worry. I can secure $100.000
to $200.000, is it enough?

01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:48.292
Good morning, Auntie Han

01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:50.251
Good morning, Mrs and Mrs Lo

01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:54.334
We decide to recruit new students
and host an open day

01:06:54.334 --> 01:06:56.376
We need your help

01:06:57.251 --> 01:06:59.584
As long as we don't give up...

01:06:59.584 --> 01:07:01.667
the school will survive
with just one new student

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:02.667
Recruitment?

01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:05.084
Young ladies

01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:08.667
we'd practice for the performance
on the open day

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:11.251
I picked a song that I love very much

01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:12.334
It's called "The Little Sun"

01:07:12.334 --> 01:07:14.251
Let's work hard

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:16.292
Many people will come
to see your performance

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.417
Our kindergarten has an open day
to recruit students

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:21.209
Please come

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:24.334
Our kindergarten is hosting an open day
to recruit students

01:07:24.334 --> 01:07:25.334
Please come with your kids

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:28.334
Got it yet?

01:07:32.001 --> 01:07:32.667
I found it

01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:46.001
Mr Wong, our kindergarten
is hosting an open day

01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:47.292
Please come if you're free

01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:50.334
You're invited too

01:07:58.209 --> 01:07:59.751
Let's build the base of the guillotine first

01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:01.667
(Attendance record)

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:05.251
Ready. One, two, three

01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:14.126
(Little Black Bean Theatre)

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:35.001
That's it. See?
I promise it'd be good for another 30 years

01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:36.584
Hurray. Papa is a genius

01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:06.376
Remember your medicine

01:09:07.001 --> 01:09:08.334
OK

01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:22.376
I have a proposal for Mr Chin
Sure

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:24.376
Could you make sure he gets it? It's important
No problem

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:27.251
Will you put it in his hands yourself?
No problem

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:28.334
OK, thanks
You're welcome

01:09:28.334 --> 01:09:30.001
Bye
Bye

01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:35.001
Granny, happy birthday

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:37.251
Thank you my dear

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:39.667
He's been painting it for a whole week

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:40.667
Really?

01:09:41.251 --> 01:09:42.251
Isn't it beautiful?

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:46.334
<i>Ma;</i>

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:50.251
Mommy, when do we get to eat the cake?

01:09:50.251 --> 01:09:52.292
Be patient, my dear
It won't be long

01:09:54.251 --> 01:09:56.251
Where's Wai-hung?
What takes her so long?

01:09:56.251 --> 01:09:57.292
I called her, but she didn't answer

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.584
Maybe she's working and missed the call

01:09:58.584 --> 01:09:59.751
Should be here any minute

01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.667
The 4500-dollar headmistress...

01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:02.667
has to do everything herself

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:04.251
She must be busy

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:09.209
Dong, how's Wai-hung's health lately?

01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:11.334
She's OK

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:15.334
Dr Chan, the herbalist told me...

01:10:15.334 --> 01:10:18.251
she has been missing/her
follow-up appointments for some time

01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:21.251
I'll ask her to see Dr Chan

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:24.001
The school term will be over soon and she'll quit

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:27.417
She'll quit?

01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:31.376
My friend saw her in Yuen Long
couple days ago handing out leaflets

01:10:31.376 --> 01:10:34.334
She's hosting an open day
to recruit students for the kindergarten

01:10:35.251 --> 01:10:37.251
Look. Here's the leaflet

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.001
Take good care of her

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.376
I'm so sorry. I'm late

01:10:51.376 --> 01:10:53.334
Hi guys
Hello

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:56.001
Hin, you've grown taller

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.209
Auntie Wai-hung

01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:59.334
Wai-hung's here.
Let's cut the cake first.

01:10:59.334 --> 01:11:00.334
Sure

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:03.376
Mom, happy birthday

01:11:03.376 --> 01:11:05.251
Thank you

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:11.376
Look at you. You look pale

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:14.209
Take good care of yourself

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:16.667
I'm fine, Mom. Don't worry

01:11:18.251 --> 01:11:20.334
Sorry. My cell phone ran out of battery

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:50.001
London. The Netherlands. The U.S.

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.292
I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me please

01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:53.334
Paris

01:11:53.334 --> 01:11:55.417
I was going to tell you,

01:11:56.376 --> 01:11:59.001
but I don't know how to put it

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:04.376
I said it'd only be 4 months...

01:12:04.376 --> 01:12:07.001
and I'd only help students move to other schools

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:10.251
But did you know why I want to keep teaching?

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:11.334
I don't want the school to close down

01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:13.084
I want education for the students

01:12:13.084 --> 01:12:14.417
I don't want to give them up

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:29.667
You gave it all in a kindergarten
with 500 students

01:12:29.667 --> 01:12:32.376
In a small one with 5 students
you gave even more

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:37.292
I'm really mad this time

01:12:38.334 --> 01:12:41.209
You promised me

01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:44.334
Why didn't you tell me you'll keep teaching?

01:12:56.251 --> 01:12:58.334
Didn't you know I'm worried about your health?

01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:03.334
And you never take your medicine on time

01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:07.542
You had the tumor removed

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:10.251
but that doesn't mean it won't recur

01:13:14.334 --> 01:13:16.251
I want to travel with you...

01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:20.251
so that you can relax yourself

01:13:28.251 --> 01:13:29.292
Hello, Kit

01:13:29.292 --> 01:13:32.251
Boss, the guillotine collapsed

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.334
What?
The workers are injured

01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:36.584
I'll be there right away

01:13:38.376 --> 01:13:41.001
We have a situation in the museum
I have to take a look

01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:48.001
<i>Boss</i>

01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:01.667
How're the workers now?

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:04.334
On the way to hospital
Thank god it's just minor injury

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.376
What do we do now?

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:16.334
We still got one day
Let's do it ourselves

01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:42.667
(I got to stay and work in museum all night)

01:14:42.667 --> 01:14:45.334
(Come here for the opening ceremony
before 6pm tomorrow.)

01:14:45.334 --> 01:14:47.042
(See you)

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:04.251
(Dong, you're always my loving husband
You're the best.)

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.251
(I'll see you there)

01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:25.292
(Open Day)

01:15:31.251 --> 01:15:34.417
Come and eat. I got sponge cake
Thanks

01:15:37.292 --> 01:15:40.376
We use this for communication
You're number 3

01:15:40.376 --> 01:15:42.376
I'm number 1?
Yes, you are

01:15:51.667 --> 01:15:53.209
Hi everyone

A car is coming...

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:03.251
Got it, papa. Over

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:07.376

Hurray

Welcome to the Open Day

This way... this...

01:17:29.251 --> 01:17:33.251
Calling headquarter
The car isn't coming this way

01:17:33.251 --> 01:17:34.667
It made a turn

01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:39.251
<i>COPY</i>

01:17:42.667 --> 01:17:45.251
That's OK. We'll wait

01:17:45.251 --> 01:17:47.251
There will be someone soon. OK?

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.334
Here it is

Calling headquarter. Another car coming

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:29.376
There's a kid in the car. A kid in the car

Please park your car
and take your child in for a look

01:19:03.251 --> 01:19:04.334
It's convenient

01:19:04.334 --> 01:19:08.334

Hey, mister. Don't go... mister

01:19:25.376 --> 01:19:29.376
Wait... don't go

01:19:29.376 --> 01:19:37.376
We're here. Please don't go...

01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:39.667
Headmistress, it's Bowie

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:43.251
I've asked a few partners to meet you

01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:45.667
It's hard to make an appointment with them

01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:49.251
Come to my office at 4pm today
Don't be late

01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:56.376
Well... OK. I'll see you there

01:20:56.376 --> 01:20:58.001
See you

The brilliant projection is...

01:21:00.334 --> 01:21:05.251
the creation of these three designers
They are Y3

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:16.584
Headmistress Lui

01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:19.334

the 5 students at Yuen Tin Kindergarten...

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:24.376
Hold on. I care about not 5...

01:22:24.376 --> 01:22:28.376
but 5,000 students in every district. Take a seat

01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:31.251
It's important and I must tell you

01:22:31.251 --> 01:22:32.376
Private tuition is worth...

01:22:32.376 --> 01:22:35.334
HK$3.5 to 4 billion a month...

01:22:35.334 --> 01:22:38.251
a market not to be overlooked

01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:39.334
With so many monster parents around

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:41.251
there's no reason we should give it a miss

01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:42.376
That's why we'll exploit...

01:22:42.376 --> 01:22:46.292
the cram school market for kindergarten students

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:47.376
I'd open...

01:22:49.209 --> 01:22:54.251
one cram preschool in every Hong Kong district

01:22:55.251 --> 01:22:58.334
and expand to the untapped market of mainland China

01:22:58.334 --> 01:23:00.251
It'll be huge

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:05.251
We're missing an icon

01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:10.251
You got a loving image

01:23:10.376 --> 01:23:12.334
a demure approachable face

01:23:12.667 --> 01:23:16.376
You're perfect to be...

01:23:16.376 --> 01:23:20.376
Hong Kong's first tutor queen
for kindergarten students

01:23:20.376 --> 01:23:22.251
Well said...

01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:27.334
We'd put your face all over Hong Kong

01:23:27.334 --> 01:23:32.001
Mongkok. Tsimshatsui. Causeway Bay
Cross-harbor Tunnel

01:23:32.001 --> 01:23:33.751
You'll be a superstar

01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:41.667
You mean kindergarten children
must get all A's

01:23:41.667 --> 01:23:43.292
must go to cram school?

01:23:43.667 --> 01:23:45.376
Of course

01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.376
Here...

01:23:51.334 --> 01:23:54.251
We'll pay you this amount to hire you

01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:57.292
Plus 1% of your classes' tuition as bonus

01:23:57.292 --> 01:24:01.251
I guarantee you'd make
over HK$10 million a year

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:07.251
And you might as well forget about
those village kids then

01:24:22.334 --> 01:24:26.334
Bowie, are you running a bank...

01:24:26.334 --> 01:24:28.042
or a school?

01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:37.292
I'm a teacher, but I'm not like you

01:24:38.334 --> 01:24:40.334
I don't just teach

01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:46.251
Teaching is a meaningful job

01:24:46.251 --> 01:24:48.292
To be a role model
for students

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:51.001
To influence other lives
with my own life

01:24:51.001 --> 01:24:52.334
Got it?

01:26:04.667 --> 01:26:07.417
Headmistress, no one came

01:26:07.667 --> 01:26:10.376
Why don't they come to see our performance?

01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:30.417
We still got two weeks before the term is over

01:26:31.667 --> 01:26:34.001
There's still hope

01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:37.292
We...

01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:40.334
Headmistress...

01:27:08.251 --> 01:27:11.334
To influence other lives
with my own life

01:27:11.334 --> 01:27:14.334
But we found signs of recurrence

01:27:14.334 --> 01:27:19.376
And she's overworked
That might worsen her case

01:27:19.376 --> 01:27:22.251
We suggest surgical operation...

01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:24.001
right after she wakes up

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:35.334
Wai-hung

01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:43.376
Dong... I'm sorry

01:27:45.251 --> 01:27:48.584
That's OK. I'll call the doctor

01:27:49.042 --> 01:27:50.251
Just wait here

01:28:14.334 --> 01:28:18.251
My dear, look out the window now

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.334
It's OK that you didn't come
I brought it here

01:28:47.667 --> 01:28:52.251
It's you who gave me the courage
to complete this piece

01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:59.209
You too, you must have courage and faith

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:00.417
You'd recover soon

01:29:06.251 --> 01:29:11.376
Along the way
I'll hold you gently if you fall

01:29:11.376 --> 01:29:16.251
You'd make me so proud of myself

01:29:18.292 --> 01:29:23.251
Happiness will keep you company

01:29:23.251 --> 01:29:27.376
While you search for the good in life

01:29:38.584 --> 01:29:39.584
Don't worry

01:29:39.584 --> 01:29:43.251
I'll be here with you
the moment you wake up

01:29:52.292 --> 01:30:03.251
(I sincerely wish you a bright future ahead)

01:30:03.376 --> 01:30:14.251
(I'll devote all my heart and soul
to keep you encouraged)

01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:17.459
Mr Dong-dong, what's your dream?

01:30:17.667 --> 01:30:19.251
Dream?

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:27.417
(Speedy recovery to Headmistress - Dong)

01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:34.251
(Along the way
I'll hold you gently if you fall)

01:30:34.251 --> 01:30:39.376
(You'd make me so proud of myself)

01:30:39.376 --> 01:30:45.251
(Happiness will keep you company)

01:30:45.251 --> 01:30:51.251
(While you search for the good in life)

01:30:51.251 --> 01:31:02.376
(Turn every sigh into the power of life)

01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:08.292
(Have faith in resolving problems)

01:31:08.292 --> 01:31:15.376
(The sun will shine when the clouds clear up)

01:31:15.376 --> 01:31:21.334
(I sincerely wish you a bright future ahead)

01:31:21.417 --> 01:31:24.584
(Headmistress, I miss you a lot)

01:31:27.251 --> 01:31:34.292
(I'll devote all my heart and soul
to keep you encouraged)

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:39.209
Headmistress, I miss you so much

01:31:39.209 --> 01:31:52.334
(I'll devote all my heart and soul
to keep you encouraged)

01:32:17.334 --> 01:32:24.334
(Last day of school term)

01:32:41.667 --> 01:32:43.251
Are you ready?

01:32:44.251 --> 01:32:45.334
They're waiting

01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:57.667
(Yuen Tin Village)

01:33:39.667 --> 01:33:41.542
Good day, Headmistress

01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:45.251
It's the last day and you didn't recruit any new kid

01:33:45.251 --> 01:33:48.334
As said, the kindergarten...

01:33:48.334 --> 01:33:52.209
closes down at today. OK?

01:35:11.334 --> 01:35:14.376
Headmistress, it's great to see you back

01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:18.251
Welcome back, Headmistress

01:35:20.251 --> 01:35:22.376
Welcome back

01:35:24.209 --> 01:35:27.209
Headmistress, welcome back

01:35:34.292 --> 01:35:37.251
So glad to see you, Headmistress

01:35:41.626 --> 01:35:46.334
<i>Headmistress, we miss you</i> a <i>lot</i>

01:35:57.292 --> 01:35:58.417
Thank you

01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:19.376
Headmistress, welcome back

01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:33.251
Take a seat

01:36:36.001 --> 01:36:37.251
You too, let's be seated

01:36:49.667 --> 01:36:55.376
It's the last day of Yuen Tin Kindergarten

01:36:57.334 --> 01:36:59.292
In the past months

01:36:59.292 --> 01:37:03.667
Headmistress has shown me the brightest

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:06.251
and the best in human nature

01:37:07.334 --> 01:37:12.542
She has given her all for this school

01:37:13.626 --> 01:37:15.042
but still...

01:37:18.459 --> 01:37:22.292
We have a gift

01:37:23.001 --> 01:37:25.042
that we want to present to Headmistress

01:37:25.042 --> 01:37:26.542
with our most sincere appreciation

01:38:24.376 --> 01:38:29.376
(Like a hibiscus flower)

01:38:29.376 --> 01:38:34.376
(The sun hangs in the Eastern sky)

01:38:34.376 --> 01:38:40.292
(Hiding her shy round face behind
the blushing clouds)

01:38:40.292 --> 01:38:44.334
(Smiling in silence)

01:38:44.667 --> 01:38:49.334
(Like a big pumpkin)

01:38:49.334 --> 01:38:54.251
(The sun hangs in the sky up high)

01:38:54.251 --> 01:39:00.251
(Shining on the hills happily)

01:39:00.251 --> 01:39:04.209
(young buds of grasses grow)

01:39:51.667 --> 01:39:56.376
(A big mouth smiling)

01:39:56.376 --> 01:40:01.334
(She rises after she sets)

01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:06.334
(Respect her; love her)

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:11.334
(I gave her all my heart)

01:40:11.334 --> 01:40:16.334
(The sun goes home when she gets tired)

01:40:16.334 --> 01:40:21.334
(It feels a bit scary in the dark)

01:40:21.334 --> 01:40:27.001
(But when the moon sets tomorrow
the sun will come back up again)

01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:32.001
(She rises just like before)

01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:54.251
Headmistress, we missed you every day

01:40:56.251 --> 01:41:02.251
We hold back our tears just for the performance

01:41:02.251 --> 01:41:07.209
Headmistress, can we cry now?

01:41:35.251 --> 01:41:40.334
Ladies and gentlemen
This is the last day of school

01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:43.251
I have a gown

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:52.334
for our only graduate this year, Lo Ka-ka

01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:09.001
I've taught for over 20 years

01:42:09.001 --> 01:42:11.376
and I've been to many graduation ceremonies

01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:17.292
This is the most unforgettable one

01:42:20.292 --> 01:42:24.209
Though there are only 5 students in this school

01:42:24.209 --> 01:42:26.376
and only 1 graduate

01:42:29.334 --> 01:42:31.709
teaching here is the best thing...

01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:34.251
that could ever happen to me

01:42:38.334 --> 01:42:41.292
Ka-ka. You graduate today

01:42:43.334 --> 01:42:47.334
I'll miss you a lot
and I send you my best wishes

01:42:49.251 --> 01:42:52.209
Remember what I said

01:42:52.209 --> 01:42:55.334
Your ability goes way
beyond what you can imagine

01:42:56.251 --> 01:43:00.251
So, you should study hard

01:43:01.251 --> 01:43:03.292
Keep working towards your dream

01:43:08.251 --> 01:43:13.251
Lo Ka-ka
now present to you your graduation certificate

01:43:15.251 --> 01:43:17.251
Thank you Headmistress

01:43:21.376 --> 01:43:23.334
Time for graduation speech
A big hand for Lo Ka-ka

01:43:33.209 --> 01:43:38.376
Mr Chairman, Headmistress
ladies and gentlemen

01:43:40.667 --> 01:43:45.376
I'm proud to be a graduate
from Yuen Tin Kindergarten

01:43:47.251 --> 01:43:54.292
Not long ago
most teachers and classmates left us

01:43:55.376 --> 01:44:00.334
But I'm grateful that Headmistress came

01:44:01.334 --> 01:44:04.334
so that we could still come to classes

01:44:06.251 --> 01:44:10.334
Headmistress, thanks for teaching me...

01:44:11.376 --> 01:44:15.251
and visiting my family from time to time

01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:21.251
From now on, I will study hard

01:44:22.292 --> 01:44:28.334
When I grow up, I want to be like you

01:44:29.292 --> 01:44:33.209
helping those in need

01:44:34.251 --> 01:44:39.251
Headmistress. Thank you

01:44:57.251 --> 01:45:01.084
But Headmistress

01:45:01.084 --> 01:45:07.001
can I not graduate at all? Can I?

01:45:30.001 --> 01:45:33.667
Kitty, Jennie, I want to see you graduate...

01:45:33.667 --> 01:45:39.459
from primary, secondary school
and university, OK?

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:41.042
Yay

01:45:48.667 --> 01:45:52.292
Headmistress, what's your dream?

01:45:56.334 --> 01:46:01.084
My dream is to be the good teacher

01:46:01.084 --> 01:46:04.042
who waits for the 5 of you
by the school door every morning

01:46:04.042 --> 01:46:06.292
That's the happiest thing I can dream of

01:46:08.292 --> 01:46:19.001
(It feels sad to leave
I'll miss my teachers for life)

01:46:19.001 --> 01:46:23.292
(We bid farewell and go separate ways)

01:46:23.292 --> 01:46:29.292
(Still faintly recall the mischief we played)

01:46:29.292 --> 01:46:36.292
(The chick has grown up
and will leave the nest today)

01:46:36.292 --> 01:46:40.042
(It'll strive to live a good life)

01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:44.292
(You're a guiding light)

01:46:44.292 --> 01:46:50.334
(You'd meet students
you've taught wherever you go)

01:46:50.334 --> 01:46:55.042
(I sincerely wish you the best)

01:46:55.042 --> 01:47:01.251
(May the wind take you where you want to be)

01:47:01.251 --> 01:47:05.334
(Let's shake hands now)

01:47:05.334 --> 01:47:11.584
(Singing out loud in our beloved school)

01:47:11.584 --> 01:47:17.042
(No one knows what happens tomorrow)

01:47:17.042 --> 01:47:23.667
(Pacing hastily; acting ambitious)

01:47:25.209 --> 01:47:29.292
(Letting go of your hand now)

01:47:29.292 --> 01:47:34.417
(When and where will we shake hands again?)

01:47:35.376 --> 01:47:45.084
(In a lifetime, you must meet
a good teacher who changes your life)

01:47:48.334 --> 01:47:55.251
(Villagers were deeply touched
and they sent in two students)

01:47:55.251 --> 01:48:02.292
(Yuen Tin Kindergarten
was saved and keeps running till now)

01:48:06.292 --> 01:48:11.292
(Today, Headmistress Lui still work
at Yuen Tin Kindergarten)

01:48:13.292 --> 01:48:17.251
(In just 5 years
the number of students has grown to over 60)

01:48:17.251 --> 01:48:21.209
(Countless children and families
received blessings from her)
