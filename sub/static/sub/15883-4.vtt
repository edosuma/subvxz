I've got titties in my mouth.

01:44.587 --> 01:46.059
- Thank you.
- All right, that's enough.

01:46.087 --> 01:47.439
That's sheer poetry.
Sheer poetry.

01:47.467 --> 01:48.761
- What's up guys?
- Hey, you guys.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.345
- I'm Jordan Peele.
- I'm Keegan-Michael Key.

01:50.345 --> 01:52.345
- This is <i>Key and Peele</i>.
- Thank you.

01:57.679 --> 02:01.435
So, we are fans of action...
What's your favorite action...

02:01.518 --> 02:04.053
- Who's your favorite action star?
- My favorite action star is Tony Jaa.

02:04.081 --> 02:06.081
- Tony Jaa.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

02:06.137 --> 02:08.137
- You know this guy?
- He's from Thailand,

02:08.220 --> 02:10.755
and he's a dynamo, he's a firecracker.
He's always like, "Yaa!"

02:11.672 --> 02:14.860
I love all the Asian and black people
were, like, "Yeah, Tony Jaa."

02:16.607 --> 02:18.333
I like that you're bringing
that muay Thai out.

02:18.361 --> 02:19.805
Oh, muay Thai,
that's what he uses.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.833
- That's my jam right there.
- Do you like muay Thai?

02:21.889 --> 02:23.535
- Do you like muay Thai?
- Bip. Bip. Bip. Bip.

02:23.646 --> 02:25.360
- No, I've been learning?
- You're learning?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.057
I've been practicing
some of my techniques.

02:27.085 --> 02:30.015
Oh, have you been studying
muay Thai from a muay Thai master?

02:33.848 --> 02:35.848
You've been studying muay Thai
from a muay Thai master?

02:35.848 --> 02:38.911
On TV, yes. On TV.
They're on television.

02:38.911 --> 02:40.445
You can study them yourself.

02:41.118 --> 02:42.445
MMA.

02:44.528 --> 02:46.303
Are you studying...
What is this?

02:46.472 --> 02:48.329
- Sorry?
- Is that muay Thai chi?

02:48.357 --> 02:49.963
I mean, right there? What is...?

02:50.763 --> 02:53.327
But this is... this is
good martial arts

02:53.398 --> 02:55.536
 if you're in the slo-mo section
of the film.

02:56.448 --> 02:59.617
Mmm-taka-taka-taka-taka.
Tang-taka-taka-taka-taka.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.644
Taka-taka-taka-taka
taka-taka-taka-taka.

03:03.005 --> 03:05.064
I've still got him,
I don't know what happened there.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.870
Okay, watch this, everybody.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.204
(hinges creaking)

03:41.202 --> 03:43.144
I was wondering
when I would come in here

03:43.172 --> 03:45.089
to find you
sitting in that chair.

03:47.839 --> 03:49.672
It wasn't easy
tracking you down, Decker.

03:51.255 --> 03:52.861
Wasn't supposed to be.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.387
I know you've retired,
but...

03:56.443 --> 03:58.775
That's all behind me now,
General.

04:01.025 --> 04:03.978
I'm not the man you knew
during the Cold War.

04:04.034 --> 04:05.650
I understand.

04:06.177 --> 04:09.195
We're now facing a threat unlike
any we've ever faced before.

04:10.306 --> 04:13.179
- A man with your expertise...
- I made a vow.

04:15.374 --> 04:17.760
Never to kill another
human being.

04:20.897 --> 04:22.253
Sorry, General,

04:23.503 --> 04:25.560
gotta have to find
someone else.

04:25.977 --> 04:27.301
Oh...

04:28.940 --> 04:32.309
No, we hmm...
we weren't thinking you'd do it.

04:32.809 --> 04:34.948
We were... (clears throat)
just hoping

04:35.059 --> 04:36.866
you cold recommend
someone for the job.

04:39.477 --> 04:41.336
I guess I could come out
of retirement.

04:41.833 --> 04:45.684
No. No need.
Just a recommendation will do.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.438
All right.

04:47.908 --> 04:49.132
I'll do it.

04:49.243 --> 04:51.243
You know, you're just
not what we're looking for.

04:51.354 --> 04:53.606
You sly son of a bitch.

04:54.356 --> 04:57.185
You always knew how
to push my buttons.

04:58.352 --> 05:01.895
- I'm in.
- Not you, Decker!

05:01.951 --> 05:03.840
- I'm sharp as I ever was.
- (sigh)

05:04.701 --> 05:07.321
Even faster too.
Grab my hand.

05:07.876 --> 05:08.759
Nope.

05:11.009 --> 05:12.705
Wait till I count
to three first.

05:13.829 --> 05:14.734
One.

05:14.984 --> 05:15.892
Two.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.018
Three.

05:17.852 --> 05:18.933
Okay.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.128
I want you to try
and slap me in the face.

05:21.325 --> 05:23.128
Unh! Wasn't ready for that.

05:25.517 --> 05:26.390
Try again.

05:26.723 --> 05:30.180
- Unh! 'kay, you know what?
- You know what?

05:30.319 --> 05:31.659
Didn't have my adrenaline up.

05:31.742 --> 05:34.320
'cause this is not an actual
high-stakes situation.

05:34.653 --> 05:35.739
All right.

05:37.246 --> 05:38.739
Draw your weapon.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.320
And... disarmed.
(gun hammer clicks)

05:46.347 --> 05:49.456
You're getting pretty quick.
And... disarmed. Okay.

05:50.123 --> 05:51.869
I don't need to take
your weapon.

05:54.175 --> 05:56.981
You know what?
Shoot me.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.956
I am not going to shoot you.

05:59.370 --> 06:01.945
- Wing me in the shoulder.
- This is ridiculous!

06:02.139 --> 06:04.848
Try, General,
see what happens.

06:07.820 --> 06:08.899
Deflected... Ooww!

06:11.066 --> 06:14.054
- Okay. I made a mistake coming here.
- Wing me in the other shoulder.

06:14.137 --> 06:16.443
- I'd rather not.
- I insist.

06:17.026 --> 06:19.026
Deflected... Aaahh!

06:20.721 --> 06:22.721
That was because
my other arm was already injured.

06:22.777 --> 06:26.113
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- (grunting) All right.

06:26.196 --> 06:28.816
- All or nothing. Gut shot.
- No!

06:28.844 --> 06:30.366
Gut shot!
Come on!

06:30.421 --> 06:32.646
If you can shoot me in the gut,
I'll concede.

06:32.646 --> 06:35.258
- Decker, you have two wounded arms.
- Gut shot! Go!

06:36.479 --> 06:38.225
Got it.
(groans)

06:40.058 --> 06:42.058
You... you caught the bullet?

06:42.974 --> 06:44.974
(groaning) Oh, yeah.

06:45.168 --> 06:46.624
So, you're telling me
that the bullet

06:46.680 --> 06:49.529
is in-between your hands
right now?

06:49.918 --> 06:51.918
That's what I'm telling you...

06:52.307 --> 06:53.373
(sighs)

06:54.040 --> 06:55.561
(birds chirping)

06:58.394 --> 06:59.859
Is that all you got?

07:00.582 --> 07:02.941
Come on. Head shot.

07:05.335 --> 07:07.025
Head shot.
Let's go.

07:07.580 --> 07:10.157
I'm ready. I wasn't...
Wait one sec. though.

07:10.185 --> 07:11.073
(gunshot)

07:14.323 --> 07:17.237
Okay, I just want people to be
straight with us and just admit...

07:17.293 --> 07:21.042
Who here has tormented
a substitute teacher?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.207
(applause)

07:23.263 --> 07:24.305
I don't understand why.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.065
I don't believe the people who are
raising their hands, by the way.

07:27.121 --> 07:29.121
- (laughs) Right.
- They seem way too polite.

07:29.177 --> 07:32.188
I don't understand why. But why?
I've never understood why.

07:32.216 --> 07:34.861
I always tried to be polite
to the substitute teacher.

07:34.861 --> 07:37.518
Everybody had that kid
in school that was, like,

07:38.157 --> 07:40.129
- a real...
- a real rapscallion.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.581
- A rapscallion. A scallywag.
- Yeah. A jackanape.

07:43.609 --> 07:45.017
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

07:45.017 --> 07:47.489
I was the kid that was just
doodling in the corner.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.378
"What's up?"
You know, that was me.

07:50.017 --> 07:51.461
But I had...
I know you had one.

07:51.461 --> 07:53.961
I had this kid who,
 if a substitute teacher came,

07:54.017 --> 07:56.017
my man would be surfing
on the desk.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.181
No joke. My man would get up,
talking about...

07:58.209 --> 07:59.959
(imitating surf rock music)

08:00.793 --> 08:02.487
Looking him in the eye.

08:02.598 --> 08:04.598
(imitating surf rock music)
Joey. Get off... Joey.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.624
Joey, get off the desk. Joey.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.793
Joey, get off the desk.

08:11.043 --> 08:13.297
I'm telling you now
to get off the desk, Joey.

08:13.464 --> 08:16.379
Get off. Unbelievable.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.152
- Probably in jail now.
Right.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.247
(bell rings)

08:20.247 --> 08:22.247
All right, listen up, y'all.

08:22.386 --> 08:24.775
I'm y'all's substitute teacher,
Mr. Garvey.

08:25.525 --> 08:28.247
I taught school for 20 years
in the inner city,

08:29.053 --> 08:30.914
so don't even think
about messing with me.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.708
- Y'all feel me?
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.792
Okay. Let's take roll here.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.544
Jay Quellin.

08:41.322 --> 08:42.438
Where's Jay Quellin at?

08:42.989 --> 08:44.656
No Jay Quellin here?

08:46.073 --> 08:47.481
(clear throats)
Yeah.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.202
Uh, do you mean "Jacqueline"?

08:50.508 --> 08:52.760
Okay. So that's how it's gonna be.

08:53.038 --> 08:55.657
Y'all wanna play.
Okay, then.

08:56.935 --> 08:58.795
I got my eyes on you,
Jay Quellin.

09:02.674 --> 09:03.934
Balakay.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.789
Where is Balakay at?

09:08.428 --> 09:10.146
There's no Balakay
here today?

09:12.007 --> 09:14.557
- Yes, sir.
- My name is Blake.

09:14.585 --> 09:17.931
Bl...
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

09:18.862 --> 09:20.917
(mocking voice) Blake!
What?

09:21.306 --> 09:23.416
- Do you wanna go to war, Balakey?
- No.

09:23.444 --> 09:25.189
- 'cause we could go to war.
- No.

09:25.272 --> 09:27.780
I'm for real.
I'm for <i>real</i>.

09:28.697 --> 09:30.530
So you better check yourself.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.280
Dee-nice.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.467
Is there a Dee-Nice?

09:39.661 --> 09:43.133
If one of y'all says
some silly-ass name...

09:44.411 --> 09:47.282
This whole class
is gonna feel my wrath.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.857
- Now, Dee-Nice.
- Do you mean "Denise"?

09:54.226 --> 09:56.699
- You say your name right, right now.
- Denise?

09:56.893 --> 09:58.007
- You say it right.
- Denise.

09:58.035 --> 09:58.844
- Correctly.
- Denise.

09:58.871 --> 09:59.524
- Right.
- Denise.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.148
- Right.
- Dee-Nice?

10:01.176 --> 10:02.641
That's better. (pupil sighs)
Thank you.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.671
Now, A.A. Ron.

10:06.629 --> 10:08.008
Where are you?

10:08.322 --> 10:10.206
Where is A.A. Ron right now?

10:11.474 --> 10:12.721
No A. A. Ron, huh?

10:13.610 --> 10:17.049
Well, you better be sick,
dead or mute,

10:17.246 --> 10:19.995
- A.A. Ron.
- Here! Oh, man.

10:21.895 --> 10:23.660
Why didn't you answer me
the first time I said it, huh?

10:23.904 --> 10:24.343
Huh?

10:24.471 --> 10:26.657
You know, I'm just asking you.
I said it, like, four times.

10:26.692 --> 10:30.610
So, why didn't you say it
the first time I said, "A.A. Ron"?

10:33.321 --> 10:34.827
Because it's pronounced
"Aaron".

10:34.862 --> 10:36.746
Son of a bitch!
(clattering)

10:38.642 --> 10:40.431
You done messed up, A.A. Ron!

10:40.559 --> 10:43.147
Now take your ass on down
to Oh-Shag-Henessy's office,

10:43.298 --> 10:45.463
right now, and tell him exactly
what you did!

10:46.801 --> 10:49.015
- Who?
- Oh-Shag-Henessy!

10:50.539 --> 10:51.735
Principal O'Shaughnessy?

10:51.770 --> 10:55.807
Get out of my goddamn classroom
before I break my foot off in your ass!

10:55.958 --> 10:57.070
Insubordinate...

10:58.082 --> 10:59.256
and churlish.

11:04.809 --> 11:05.726
Tym-Oh-Thee.

11:06.761 --> 11:08.949
- Present.
- Thank you.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.130
To the man of the hour.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.310
Guys... (glasses clinking)
Best bachelor party ever!

11:16.469 --> 11:17.950
(cheers)

11:18.109 --> 11:20.303
- Mm!
- Mm! Oh, yeah!

11:20.377 --> 11:21.911
- Whoo!
- Yeah! That's the stuff.

11:21.936 --> 11:24.650
- I can still do it.
- All right, fellas!

11:25.517 --> 11:29.462
What do you say...
we get a stripper?

11:29.763 --> 11:31.208
- Yeah!
- All right!

11:32.707 --> 11:34.998
Trey, I told you man,
no strippers.

11:35.072 --> 11:36.589
Aw, is this a bachelor party
or isn't it?

11:36.663 --> 11:37.953
- Yeah!
- That's right!

11:37.996 --> 11:40.764
I'm your best man, there's no way
I'm gonna let you puss out

11:40.838 --> 11:42.291
on your own bachelor party.

11:42.340 --> 11:45.929
We're getting the strippers and
we're gonna connect the dots.

11:46.004 --> 11:48.727
- Yes!
- Connect the dots? What?

11:48.769 --> 11:51.711
Yeah...
Tinkertoy it, man.

11:51.757 --> 11:53.273
We're all behind her

11:53.432 --> 11:57.276
and then we all,
bup-bup-bup-bup. We go to town!

11:57.378 --> 11:59.493
- Yeah!
- We go to town!

11:59.570 --> 12:02.589
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
What's "bup-bup-bup-bup"?

12:02.720 --> 12:05.576
Dude. You know. You're upfront,
then

12:06.076 --> 12:08.532
bup-bup-bup-bup!
Game on!

12:08.663 --> 12:10.263
(laughs)

12:10.337 --> 12:12.337
No. Hold up, hold up,
hold up. No.

12:12.837 --> 12:15.922
- What's the "bup-bup-bup-bup"?
- Yeah, yeah, what is that?

12:16.024 --> 12:17.170
Guys!

12:17.585 --> 12:21.555
This is Tommy's last night
of freedom!

12:21.657 --> 12:24.317
- Come on!
- What's "bup-bup-bup-bup", though?

12:25.868 --> 12:28.601
You know...
Bup-bup-bup-bup.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.468
Okay, okay, okay, when you say
"bup-bup-bup-bup",

12:31.483 --> 12:34.187
- are we... what are we... are we all...
- Linked up!

12:34.282 --> 12:37.975
Yeah! Baby elephant walk.
Whoo!

12:38.163 --> 12:40.248
Okay, okay, okay, um...

12:40.890 --> 12:42.592
Are you saying

12:42.780 --> 12:45.535
that we would all
be [bleep]ing each other?

12:46.145 --> 12:48.253
(laughs) You don't understand
what I'm sayi...

12:48.469 --> 12:51.540
Oh, dude! Okay. Look. 
Here it is, okay?

12:51.784 --> 12:54.382
- You're [bleep]ing the girl, right?
- Right.

12:54.484 --> 12:55.145
Yeah.

12:55.276 --> 12:58.186
Then, we bup-bup-bup-bup!

12:58.288 --> 12:59.483
That's it! Right there! Right there!

12:59.529 --> 13:01.010
Yeah, what the [bleep]?
I'm not doing that.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.132
You guys!

13:02.433 --> 13:05.413
Tommy's about to walk
the plank of marriage, all right?

13:05.430 --> 13:06.556
This is our last chance.

13:06.573 --> 13:08.458
Last chance for what?
I'm not gonna [bleep] a guy.

13:08.532 --> 13:12.470
No! Dude, we'd all
be [bleep]ing the girl.

13:12.516 --> 13:14.603
- Oh, okay!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:15.756 --> 13:17.262
Together,
bup-bup-bup,bup.

13:17.304 --> 13:18.408
- No!
- No!

13:18.567 --> 13:21.333
See, but right there, Trey.
That's the weird part!

13:21.492 --> 13:24.393
- The "bup-bup-bup-bup".
- Okay, I get it. I get it.

13:24.893 --> 13:27.292
You don't want to be disrespectful
to women. I get that.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.458
- That's not really the issue.
- Okay, forget the girl.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.664
Armenian conveyer belt: just the groom
and his groomsmen, bup-bup-bup-bup.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.903
- No!
- No!

13:33.977 --> 13:37.719
You kept the part that noboby wants!
The bup-bup-bup-bup!

13:37.793 --> 13:40.168
Yeah, I definitely don't want
to have sex with any of you guys!

13:40.242 --> 13:43.483
- Yeah, you're killing my buzz.
- Guys! What the [bleep], man!

13:43.614 --> 13:47.225
This is supposed to be Tommy's last
big celebration. No judgment.

13:47.242 --> 13:51.004
Judgment is not what is keeping us
from [bleep]ing each other!

13:51.387 --> 13:53.104
Jeez! Forget it, Trey!

13:53.178 --> 13:55.702
No! I'm saying, guys,
if you listen to my words,

13:55.833 --> 13:59.026
Tommy's in here [bleep]ing
the stripper. We're in the other room.

14:05.349 --> 14:06.542
- (quietly) Bup-bup-bup-bup.
- No!

14:06.570 --> 14:09.212
No "bup-bup-bup-bup"!
Nobody wants the "bup-bup-bup-bup"!

14:09.286 --> 14:12.180
Well, that's all right.No bup-bup-bup-
bup, okay? No bup-bup-bup-bup.

14:12.254 --> 14:15.256
You're here [bleep]ing the stripper,
the rest of us are just

14:15.302 --> 14:17.022
- jiggy-jiggy-jiggy-jiggy...
- No!

14:17.096 --> 14:17.915
- Aah! No!
- No!

14:17.921 --> 14:20.235
Oh, my God!
You guys are so gay!

14:24.514 --> 14:28.435
How do you think you would fare
if you went into the penal system?

14:28.651 --> 14:30.275
The <i>penile</i> system?

14:32.678 --> 14:34.468
I think if I went through
the penile system,

14:34.485 --> 14:36.485
I think the penile system
would go through me.

14:38.689 --> 14:40.689
(kung fu scream)

14:43.291 --> 14:44.830
(alarm buzzes)

14:45.330 --> 14:46.898
(birds squawking)

14:51.346 --> 14:54.675
<i>Lewis Lawrence is beginning
his life sentence.</i>

14:58.555 --> 15:01.482
<i>In order to survive,
he must join a gang.</i>

15:02.465 --> 15:05.060
(Lewis) <i>Do you understand?
I know how it work, right?</i>

15:05.219 --> 15:07.731
When you're in prison,
what you need is protection, right?

15:07.833 --> 15:10.035
And the way to do that
is by getting into a gang.

15:16.915 --> 15:20.650
I was surprised to find out that
there is a bald gang in prison.

15:20.650 --> 15:23.736
They're gonna be my homies.
Talking about some B.B.W.W.

15:23.838 --> 15:25.838
"Bald brothers, what-what?"

15:29.093 --> 15:32.581
What's up, homie?
(chuckles) Nice haircut.

15:34.984 --> 15:36.783
Get the [bleep] outta here.

15:36.885 --> 15:39.904
<i>I mean they haven't officially
asked me to be in the gang yet,</i>

15:40.035 --> 15:41.950
'cause you need to earn
they respect first.

15:43.747 --> 15:44.592
Hey!

15:46.143 --> 15:50.004
You're in the wrong neighborhood,
you black mother[bleep]er.

15:56.435 --> 15:57.204
Aah!

15:57.233 --> 16:01.175
Step off my homies, mother[bleep]er,
or I'll [bleep] you up!

16:04.486 --> 16:06.486
What's up! What's up!
You know what I'm talkin' about!

16:07.781 --> 16:10.635
Aah! Unh! Aah!

16:10.851 --> 16:13.447
<i>So that was it right there, okay?
That's what they call a "jump in."</i>

16:13.464 --> 16:15.293
<i>That's the initiation process.</i>

16:15.352 --> 16:18.032
So, it's my understanding
that I'm now a member

16:18.104 --> 16:20.423
of the Bald Brotherhood gang,
okay?

16:21.649 --> 16:24.833
I mean, those mother[bleep]ers
beat the [bleep] out of me.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.800
That's a euphemism
you hear all the time.

16:27.174 --> 16:29.487
But you don't know if it's true,
it can't be true. How is it possible?

16:29.577 --> 16:33.552
But that mother[bleep]er, bip!
And diarrhea just went "Pssh"!,

16:33.768 --> 16:35.141
right out my ass!

16:35.641 --> 16:39.128
So I hope... like, I hope that's,
like, lifetime dues right there.

16:39.187 --> 16:40.569
What the...?

16:40.628 --> 16:43.006
It's the happiest day of my life
is what I'm saying.

16:43.443 --> 16:45.364
<i>Despite the lack
of encouragement,</i>

16:45.675 --> 16:49.407
<i>Lewis continues to try and ingratiate
himself to the gang.</i>

16:49.434 --> 16:51.434
What? This long-haired bitch?

16:54.235 --> 16:56.423
Yeah! That's what I'm talking
about, hero!

16:56.454 --> 16:58.389
Trying to creep up on
my bald brothers, bitch!

16:58.479 --> 17:00.479
I oughta kick you again.
What? What?

17:01.074 --> 17:03.430
Aah! Oh! Aah!

17:05.347 --> 17:08.537
Hey, you all right, man? You all right?
Come on, get up, get up.

17:08.659 --> 17:10.249
We got you, son. We got you, son.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.458
What? Man, get your hands off me,
you hair-having mother[bleep]er!

17:13.490 --> 17:16.587
Aah! Aah! Man, get down there.
Unh! Unh!

17:16.684 --> 17:19.224
- Aah! Aah!
- Whoa! Unh!

17:21.742 --> 17:23.742
(alarm buzzes)

17:24.238 --> 17:26.045
I mean, I think

17:26.045 --> 17:29.046
I accidentally got hit
by some of my bald brothers.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.767
Guards!
(alarm buzzes)

17:32.740 --> 17:35.814
That's right!
Bald brotherhood forever, man!

17:36.177 --> 17:37.257
'sup!

17:38.478 --> 17:39.821
But you know,
that's prison, man.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.168
I mean, you don't never know
what side it's coming from.

17:42.258 --> 17:45.513
<i>Lewis has yet to make
any alliances.</i>

17:46.579 --> 17:49.997
<i>Meanwhile, an unprecedented
peace has been brokered</i>

17:50.025 --> 17:52.727
<i>between black and white
prison gangs.</i>

17:53.067 --> 17:55.705
<i>The once unsurmountable
racial divide</i>

17:55.764 --> 17:58.205
<i>now bridged
by a mutual hatred...</i>

17:59.672 --> 18:01.272
<i>for Lewis.</i>

18:09.529 --> 18:11.088
(bell rings)

18:12.155 --> 18:13.743
Dude!

18:14.275 --> 18:16.243
Hey, you going to Ray's party?

18:17.650 --> 18:18.620
Yeah, I'm going.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.731
- You know Amy's gonna be there.
- Yeah, I know.

18:21.877 --> 18:24.491
Things have been real good with her,
man. Tonight could be the night.

18:24.991 --> 18:28.301
- Could be.
- Dude, are you okay?

18:30.062 --> 18:31.247
Not really, dude.

18:31.747 --> 18:34.677
What's wrong? You get the hottest
girl at a party with no parents.

18:34.704 --> 18:37.080
You're definitely gonna hit
that for sure tonight, man.

18:37.202 --> 18:40.210
- You're gonna lose that V. for good.
- (slams) My penis is white.

18:42.823 --> 18:46.844
- Excuse me?
- I have a white penis.

18:46.966 --> 18:48.678
What? But you're black.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.721
Nuh-uh. I'm bi-racial.

18:52.379 --> 18:54.572
All the white went straight
to my penis.

18:54.725 --> 18:57.829
That... what... what...
you mean, like, the color?

19:01.229 --> 19:03.101
- Oh...
- Yeah.

19:03.223 --> 19:05.375
But wait, dude...
I mean...

19:06.159 --> 19:08.577
- how bad could it be?
- It's bad.

19:08.698 --> 19:10.793
- How bad?
- It's like a Snickers.

19:11.104 --> 19:14.513
- Regular or fun size?
- Which one do you get at Halloween?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.865
- Fun size.
- That's the one.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.855
- [bleep]
- I know.

19:20.008 --> 19:22.008
What am I gonna do?
I mean, I...

19:23.233 --> 19:26.617
How am I gonna hit it with Amy
with my little white penis.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.922
Everyone's gonna find out and
I'm never gonna hear the end of it.

19:29.950 --> 19:33.016
Dude, dude, dude. Amy's white.
She's not gonna care.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.218
- Really?
- Yeah. She's white.

19:37.308 --> 19:39.285
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:39.375 --> 19:43.049
I guess you're right. She's probably
not even gonna know the difference.

19:43.108 --> 19:46.685
Nah, man. White girl, white penis.
You're all good.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.415
(bell rings)

19:52.419 --> 19:55.008
Hey, there he is.
How'd it go last night?

19:55.098 --> 19:57.363
- Don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, what happened?

19:57.390 --> 19:59.005
Black vagina.

20:06.190 --> 20:07.873
(laughs) Happy?

20:08.751 --> 20:11.286
I just gotta get this off...
My girl, right here,

20:11.471 --> 20:14.430
Your mouth was agape
after "black vagina".

20:14.489 --> 20:16.263
She was just like...
(laughter)

20:19.821 --> 20:23.621
It's just, like... I've only seen...
In my whole life, I've only seen

20:23.711 --> 20:25.711
Macaulay Culkin do that.
In my whole life.

20:26.211 --> 20:28.405
Serious, she was, like,
it was crazy.

20:29.882 --> 20:31.971
- All right, let's get outta here.
- Let's get outta here.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.797
You and I go to the bar,
couple of friends. And then, maybe...

20:34.856 --> 20:36.607
- Bup-bup.
- Let's just bup-bup-bup-bup.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.392
Yeah.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.485
Good night, everybody.
