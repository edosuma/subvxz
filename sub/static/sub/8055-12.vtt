00:01.320 --> 00:02.988
Good morning, Ron.

00:03.031 --> 00:05.499
Good morning.

00:05.566 --> 00:08.568
I know how much you enjoy
paperwork, but don't hover.

00:08.620 --> 00:10.120
Nice bench.
Is that new?

00:10.205 --> 00:12.806
No, that's been there
since the '90s.

00:12.874 --> 00:14.541
What are you doing
for your birthday on Friday?

00:14.592 --> 00:17.211
Nothing.
I never d...

00:17.262 --> 00:19.446
- Aha!
- Oh, God.

00:19.514 --> 00:21.215
♪ Birthday,
birthday, birthday ♪

00:21.282 --> 00:23.217
♪ it's your birthday ♪

00:23.284 --> 00:25.152
♪ it's your birthday,
and I know when it is ♪

00:25.220 --> 00:28.255
Ron refuses to tell anyone
when his birthday is.

00:28.323 --> 00:31.158
He's even had it redacted
on all government documents.

00:31.225 --> 00:34.077
Three years of investigations,
phone calls,

00:34.162 --> 00:36.230
Freedom of Information Act
requests,

00:36.297 --> 00:37.731
and still, I had nothing...

00:37.799 --> 00:42.369
Until a well-placed bribe to
a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins

00:42.437 --> 00:44.204
revealed...

00:44.272 --> 00:46.156
Ron's birthday is on Friday.

00:46.224 --> 00:48.025
Damn it.
I was so careful.

00:48.092 --> 00:49.176
Well, you blew it.

00:49.244 --> 00:51.428
All for a free scoop
of rum raisin.

00:51.513 --> 00:53.814
Was it worth it, Ron?
Was it?

00:53.882 --> 00:55.716
I command you to do nothing.

00:55.783 --> 00:57.718
I'm not gonna do nothing.
I'm gonna do something.

00:57.769 --> 00:58.936
And it's gonna be really big.

00:59.020 --> 01:00.888
I have a lot of years
to make up for.

01:00.939 --> 01:04.691
I don't like loud noises
and people making a fuss,

01:04.759 --> 01:07.327
and I especially
don't like people celebrating

01:07.395 --> 01:11.498
because they know a piece
of private information about me.

01:11.566 --> 01:13.634
Plus,
the whole thing is a scam.

01:13.701 --> 01:17.437
Birthdays were invented
by Hallmark to sell cards.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.361
- They put up a fence.
- Who?

01:41.429 --> 01:42.846
No!

01:42.931 --> 01:44.765
- What's that?
- There's a small park

01:44.816 --> 01:46.833
on the line between Pawnee
and Eagleton, and...

01:46.901 --> 01:50.203
last night Eagleton put up
a fence around their side

01:50.271 --> 01:53.139
to keep us disgusting Pawnee
hobos off their precious land.

01:53.191 --> 01:54.641
There's even a security guard.

01:54.692 --> 01:56.877
You got to show
Eagleton I.D. to get in.

01:56.945 --> 01:58.545
Eagleton is
a bunch of rich snobs.

01:58.613 --> 02:00.981
And that's coming from someone
who has a Mercedes...

02:01.032 --> 02:04.151
With a Harman Kardon Logic 7
surround-sound system.

02:04.218 --> 02:06.420
Who builds a fence to keep
kids out of a playground?

02:06.487 --> 02:09.006
Three words...
Lindsay Carlisle Shay.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.492
Who?

02:12.543 --> 02:16.730
Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I
used to be best friends.

02:16.798 --> 02:19.166
We worked together
at the Pawnee Parks Department.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.268
Then she went to work
in Eagleton

02:21.336 --> 02:25.339
and "fixed her deviated septum"
and lost 35 pounds

02:25.406 --> 02:27.174
and lost something else.

02:27.241 --> 02:28.442
What was it again?

02:28.509 --> 02:30.177
Oh, yeah.
Her soul.

02:30.244 --> 02:31.979
Is the Eagleton side
really that much better

02:32.046 --> 02:34.681
- than the Pawnee side?
- To be fair, yeah.

02:34.732 --> 02:36.850
Our side is
this scrappy piece of land

02:36.918 --> 02:39.519
where kids go to smash
fluorescent light tubes.

02:39.570 --> 02:40.887
But it has a lot of heart.

02:40.955 --> 02:43.189
That's what people always say
when something sucks.

02:43.241 --> 02:44.791
We should stand up
for our town, okay?

02:44.859 --> 02:47.527
Pawneeans are just as good
as Eagletonians,

02:47.578 --> 02:49.997
although on average,
we are several inches shorter

02:50.064 --> 02:51.465
and 80 pounds heavier.

02:51.532 --> 02:54.301
People in Eagleton
are straight up mean to us.

02:54.369 --> 02:56.036
I would never set foot
over there.

02:56.104 --> 02:58.205
But it's the only place
that I can get

02:58.272 --> 02:59.873
my bumble and bumble
hair care products,

02:59.924 --> 03:01.742
so I'm there every eight days.

03:01.809 --> 03:04.227
Okay, well, I am
on "Operation No More Fence,"

03:04.312 --> 03:06.563
so I'm putting you in charge
of "Operation Ron's Party...

03:06.648 --> 03:08.982
- colon... Shock And Awe."
- I am all over it.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.901
I just need you
to do what's on that list.

03:10.985 --> 03:14.221
Leslie has a lot of qualities
I find horrifying.

03:14.288 --> 03:18.759
But the worst one by far
is how thoughtful she can be.

03:18.826 --> 03:20.160
It's the only park
in our neighborhood.

03:20.228 --> 03:22.079
I mean, where are
my kids supposed to play...

03:22.163 --> 03:24.414
the rock quarry?
There's rocks in there.

03:24.499 --> 03:26.166
Why don't we just set fire
to the fence?

03:26.234 --> 03:27.918
You know, set it ablaze.

03:28.002 --> 03:29.569
That's arson.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.088
Well, let's leave that
up to the lawyers.

03:31.172 --> 03:32.673
The point is, it would work.

03:32.740 --> 03:36.093
Why don't we build a fence
around their fence?

03:36.177 --> 03:38.512
- Why?
- It would give us...

03:38.579 --> 03:39.746
Two fences,

03:39.797 --> 03:42.516
so if they needed to get
to their fence

03:42.583 --> 03:45.602
for maintenance and whatnot,
their pants might get caught.

03:45.687 --> 03:47.320
My son Joey
tried to scale that fence

03:47.388 --> 03:49.473
to play on the Eagleton side,

03:49.557 --> 03:51.358
and he fell and hurt his arm.

03:51.425 --> 03:53.960
You need to get those people
to tear that fence down.

03:54.028 --> 03:55.195
This woman's right.

03:55.262 --> 03:58.865
I promise you,
citizens of Pawnee

03:58.933 --> 04:00.701
and sweet, brave Joey,

04:00.768 --> 04:02.569
I will tear down that fence.

04:04.155 --> 04:06.123
Okay, I-I'm just
gonna suggest one more time

04:06.207 --> 04:07.374
that we burn it down.

04:07.441 --> 04:09.209
But whatever you guys think.

04:09.277 --> 04:10.711
Yeah. Great.

04:10.778 --> 04:12.079
Yes, hi.

04:12.146 --> 04:15.348
I have a question about your
inflatable saxophones.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.351
Do those come
in different sizes?

04:18.418 --> 04:20.120
I'm gonna need
about 40 dozen of those.

04:20.171 --> 04:23.289
Also, what about your
neon gangster fedora hats?

04:23.341 --> 04:24.825
Um...

04:24.892 --> 04:26.643
- That was rude.
- Whatever's going on here,

04:26.728 --> 04:27.794
stop it immediately.

04:27.845 --> 04:28.962
I was just talking
on the phone.

04:29.013 --> 04:30.731
- To whom?
- It was personal.

04:30.798 --> 04:32.399
I would never make
a work-related call.

04:32.466 --> 04:35.168
You know that.

04:36.571 --> 04:39.339
- Lindsay!
- Leslie Knope.

04:39.407 --> 04:40.473
Hi.

04:40.525 --> 04:42.743
Has it really been five years?

04:42.810 --> 04:45.746
It has.
You look amazing.

04:45.813 --> 04:47.781
Thank you. This place
hasn't changed a bit...

04:47.832 --> 04:50.083
still loveable, but grimy.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.668
Hello, there.
I'm Ben Wyatt.

04:51.753 --> 04:53.320
I'm assistant city manager

04:53.387 --> 04:55.005
hi, Dan.

04:55.089 --> 04:56.656
- Ben.
- It's not important.

04:56.707 --> 04:57.874
It won't come up again.

04:57.959 --> 05:00.510
Uh, this is Ann.
She is my best friend...

05:00.595 --> 05:01.845
Now.

05:01.929 --> 05:04.264
And, uh, she's a nurse,
and she works at a hospital.

05:04.332 --> 05:06.133
- Ooh.
- Nice to meet you.

05:06.184 --> 05:08.368
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just, nursing...

05:08.436 --> 05:10.937
You must be so tired.
It's sad.

05:11.005 --> 05:14.307
It's really nice outside.
Shall we speak in my courtyard?

05:14.375 --> 05:16.676
Yeah.

05:16.744 --> 05:18.845
Well, thank you so much
for stopping by.

05:18.896 --> 05:20.680
I was passing through
Pawnee anyway.

05:20.731 --> 05:22.783
I do a lot
of charity work here.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.368
There's
only so much you can do.

05:25.453 --> 05:30.257
You know, I found a picture
of you from back in the day.

05:30.324 --> 05:32.292
Look me at that.

05:32.359 --> 05:33.794
Let me get a closer look.

05:35.696 --> 05:37.998
So let's talk
about Lafayette park.

05:38.049 --> 05:39.916
Oh, yes.
The fence.

05:40.001 --> 05:42.202
I'm only trying to protect
our children.

05:42.253 --> 05:44.070
Come on, Lindsay,
this isn't you.

05:44.138 --> 05:46.006
When we used to work here
together,

05:46.057 --> 05:48.175
we loved the fact
that parks were for everyone.

05:48.226 --> 05:49.542
That's what
makes them so great.

05:49.594 --> 05:50.844
You know what's really great?

05:50.895 --> 05:53.430
A private park
that's not for everyone.

05:53.514 --> 05:55.515
- Wowsers.
- What do you care?

05:55.583 --> 05:57.117
It's just a crappy little park.

05:57.185 --> 05:58.685
Well, someone once told me

05:58.753 --> 06:00.787
that there's no such thing
as small parks,

06:00.855 --> 06:02.772
- just small ideas.
- Mm.

06:02.857 --> 06:04.608
And that someone...

06:04.692 --> 06:06.610
Was this woman.

06:06.694 --> 06:08.111
You can take it if you want.

06:08.196 --> 06:10.113
I have many copies
and the negatives.

06:10.198 --> 06:11.615
And I have a jpeg.

06:11.699 --> 06:14.251
The fence stays up.

06:14.335 --> 06:15.802
- Lindsay, if we...
- Sweetie...

06:15.870 --> 06:17.570
And I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

06:17.622 --> 06:20.457
Pawnee is and always will be
a dirty, little nightmare

06:20.541 --> 06:22.626
from which
you will never wake up.

06:24.178 --> 06:27.681
But it was good seeing you.

06:27.748 --> 06:29.983
What?
I'm not asleep. I'm awake.

06:30.051 --> 06:32.469
I'm wide awake,
and I got my eyes on you.

06:32.553 --> 06:33.720
That's what I would've said

06:33.771 --> 06:36.973
if I had thought of it
in the moment.

06:37.058 --> 06:38.758
What did I say instead?

06:41.358 --> 06:43.758
Wow! This is where they have
their Public Forums?

06:43.807 --> 06:46.609
- Yeah, it's not that great.
- They had a valet.

06:46.676 --> 06:48.594
Yes, Eagleton
is nicer than Pawnee.

06:48.678 --> 06:50.712
And, yes, because
of their cupcake factory,

06:50.764 --> 06:52.214
the air always
smells like vanilla.

06:52.265 --> 06:53.882
Oh, yeah.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.651
- Wow.
- But...

06:55.719 --> 06:57.886
Their people are not inherently
better than our people.

06:57.938 --> 06:59.221
The only thing they beat us in

06:59.272 --> 07:01.223
is life expectancy,
beauty pageants,

07:01.274 --> 07:02.908
and average income...
who cares?

07:02.993 --> 07:04.226
Factoid alert...

07:04.294 --> 07:06.595
Eagleton was founded
by former Pawneeans.

07:06.913 --> 07:10.149
Pawnee was established
in May of 1817.

07:10.216 --> 07:11.483
And by July,

07:11.534 --> 07:14.153
finding the smell unpleasant
and the soil untenable,

07:14.220 --> 07:18.824
all the wealthy people
evacuated to Eagleton.

07:18.892 --> 07:20.259
Hello, Pawnee.

07:20.326 --> 07:22.928
Welcome to our public forum.

07:22.996 --> 07:25.164
Hi, I'm
Thomas Montgomery Haverford.

07:25.231 --> 07:27.566
- Okay.
- Well, nice outfit.

07:27.634 --> 07:29.051
What, did you just come
from the stables?

07:29.135 --> 07:30.335
Yes.

07:30.386 --> 07:32.237
- I was just at the stables.
- Oh.

07:32.305 --> 07:34.339
You look like
you've been working hard.

07:34.407 --> 07:36.275
You have
a million flyaways right now.

07:36.342 --> 07:38.610
Would you like to borrow
a mirror or a self-help book?

07:38.678 --> 07:39.611
I would not.

07:39.679 --> 07:40.979
I would like you to get off
your high horse,

07:41.047 --> 07:43.015
Lindsay... pun intended.

07:43.082 --> 07:45.984
You know if I had your job,
there would be no fence there.

07:46.052 --> 07:47.202
Well, you don't have my job,

07:47.287 --> 07:49.020
because you knew
you couldn't handle it.

07:49.072 --> 07:51.256
Oh, the forum is beginning.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.292
Uh, we've got a little bit
of Eagleton business,

07:53.359 --> 07:55.377
- and then I'll introduce you.
- Great.

07:55.461 --> 07:57.763
Look how pretty the people are.

07:57.831 --> 07:59.698
Hey, Ron...

07:59.749 --> 08:01.500
How's the street parking
at your house?

08:01.551 --> 08:03.569
- What?
- Can you handle, like, 20 cars

08:03.636 --> 08:05.037
or a double-Decker party bus?

08:05.104 --> 08:07.539
There is no street parking
at my house.

08:07.607 --> 08:09.942
My house
is not even on a street.

08:10.009 --> 08:14.713
Do you have space
for, like, a huge circus tent?

08:14.764 --> 08:16.215
Hey, Ron.
Have you seen...

08:16.282 --> 08:17.716
what the hell?

08:17.784 --> 08:19.768
No!

08:19.853 --> 08:21.053
Oh!

08:21.120 --> 08:22.654
Well, looks like
there wont be any balloons

08:22.722 --> 08:24.056
for the birthday boy.

08:24.123 --> 08:26.058
These were for a sick child
at the hospital.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.492
Ah.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.827
My office, now.

08:28.895 --> 08:31.063
- I don't work for you.
- Don't care.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.831
Decisions, decisions.

08:32.899 --> 08:34.466
Uh, I think I'm gonna go

08:34.534 --> 08:37.001
with the porcini mushrooms
and boursin, <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

08:37.068 --> 08:38.419
...that the Eagleton-Pawnee fence

08:38.504 --> 08:41.340
does a lot more harm
than it does good.

08:41.407 --> 08:45.244
Hello. I'm Bertram Rolands,
a citizen of Eagleton.

08:48.081 --> 08:49.848
With all due respect,
Ms. Knope,

08:49.916 --> 08:52.284
can't you just clean up
your side of the park,

08:52.352 --> 08:53.752
put some new equipment there?

08:53.803 --> 08:55.053
Well, we would love to do that,

08:55.104 --> 08:58.690
but, unfortunately,
money is tight right now.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.442
Hello.
I'm Christine Porter.

09:03.863 --> 09:06.815
I want to respectfully say
that I'm in favor of the fence.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.785
I see it as a kind
of punishment for Pawnee

09:09.869 --> 09:13.071
that might inspire your town
to clean up its act.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.775
Well, I would like
to respectfully say

09:16.826 --> 09:19.678
that any child should be able
to play in any park,

09:19.746 --> 09:23.148
regardless of wealth or status.

09:26.352 --> 09:29.638
Uh, anyway,
this is Joey Plunkett.

09:29.722 --> 09:31.423
Joey, wave to the audience.

09:31.474 --> 09:34.192
Oh, you can't,
because you broke your arm

09:34.260 --> 09:35.794
climbing that fence.

09:35.845 --> 09:38.180
- Uh, I can wave with this arm.
- No, you can't.

09:38.264 --> 09:40.399
Both your arms are broken.

09:40.466 --> 09:42.234
All due respect,
I recognize that boy.

09:42.302 --> 09:45.470
He was caught selling
fireworks to Eagleton kids.

09:45.521 --> 09:47.973
Well, with more due respect,

09:48.041 --> 09:49.691
a lot of boys do that
in our town.

09:49.776 --> 09:51.243
You cannot be sure
that he is the one.

09:51.311 --> 09:54.680
This is a perfect example
of how we're going to help you.

09:54.747 --> 09:57.082
Here's to you, Joey,
and your mother

09:57.150 --> 10:00.886
and to every Pawnee citizen
who might have a bright future

10:00.954 --> 10:04.039
if they fundamentally change
everything about themselves.

10:04.123 --> 10:06.758
- Thanks to Leslie Knope.
- I'm not done.

10:06.826 --> 10:08.877
Isn't she trying her hardest?

10:10.930 --> 10:14.683
So cute and so good.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.852
I'm only gonna ask you
this once.

10:16.936 --> 10:18.537
What is going on
with my birthday?

10:18.604 --> 10:20.639
Oh, my God.
Ron, it's your birthday.

10:20.690 --> 10:22.941
- Happy Birthday.
- Shut your damn mouth.

10:23.009 --> 10:24.576
This is a fun conversation.

10:24.644 --> 10:26.678
Just tell me
what Leslie is planning.

10:26.729 --> 10:29.748
Honestly, I-I don't know.
I haven't heard anything.

10:29.816 --> 10:32.284
Why don't you tell me what
she did for your last birthday?

10:32.351 --> 10:34.236
Oh, well, that was intense.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.854
She totally surprised me.

10:35.922 --> 10:37.372
She kidnapped me from work,

10:37.457 --> 10:39.391
and then she took me
to that place, <i>Senor Vega's</i>,

10:39.459 --> 10:41.093
you know, where
the mariachi band comes out.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.728
They put a big sombrero on you,

10:42.795 --> 10:44.096
and then everybody sings
Happy Birthday?

10:44.163 --> 10:45.230
Damn it.

10:45.298 --> 10:46.565
And then we went
back to my house,

10:46.632 --> 10:49.267
and she invited
basically everyone I knew,

10:49.335 --> 10:51.903
and she had this great guy
doing face painting,

10:51.971 --> 10:54.389
and I had my face painted
like a fairy tiger.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.559
Also, she did it, like,
a week before my birthday,

10:57.643 --> 11:00.145
which is genius, 'cause
I had no idea it was coming.

11:00.212 --> 11:02.614
And then there was
a bouncy castle.

11:02.682 --> 11:04.349
Did you know
they made those for adults?

11:04.417 --> 11:05.650
Mm-hmm.

11:05.718 --> 11:07.736
Maybe I'll change it up
this time.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.287
Can I try
the andouille sausage?

11:09.355 --> 11:11.990
- Tom, let's go.
- What? No.

11:12.058 --> 11:14.593
Hey, not you too.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.361
It's gross.
I don't like it.

11:16.412 --> 11:18.497
It's disgusting.

11:18.564 --> 11:20.449
Did you guys get
your public forum gift bag?

11:20.516 --> 11:22.134
There's an iPod touch in here.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.869
Man, she used
to not be like this.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.370
Eagleton really changed her.

11:25.421 --> 11:27.773
Yeah, what exactly happened
between the two of you, anyway?

11:27.840 --> 11:30.625
Five years ago,
Eagleton offered me that job.

11:30.710 --> 11:33.178
And you said no?
Are you insane?

11:33.245 --> 11:35.263
I talked it over with Lindsay,
and we made a pact

11:35.348 --> 11:37.382
that we would stay
in Pawnee together

11:37.433 --> 11:40.218
and work hard
and fight to make Pawnee

11:40.269 --> 11:41.887
a better place to live.

11:41.938 --> 11:43.755
And then
they offered her the job,

11:43.823 --> 11:46.224
and she took it
and disappeared.

11:46.275 --> 11:47.309
Wow.

11:47.393 --> 11:51.262
Ooh, verbena-scented
soy candles!

11:51.314 --> 11:53.865
You want me to do what, now?

11:53.933 --> 11:56.201
Send Leslie somewhere
on an assignment,

11:56.269 --> 11:57.636
a conference or something,

11:57.703 --> 12:00.939
and make her take April
and freeze their bank accounts.

12:01.007 --> 12:01.940
I don't understand.

12:02.008 --> 12:04.042
Is Leslie's work
unsatisfactory?

12:04.110 --> 12:05.977
No, it has nothing to do
with her work.

12:06.045 --> 12:08.213
I don't want to get into it.

12:08.281 --> 12:10.799
Ron, look, this is me, okay?

12:10.883 --> 12:13.218
You know you can talk to me
about anything.

12:13.285 --> 12:17.022
Well, it's... it's
my birthday on Friday.

12:17.090 --> 12:19.290
Hey!
Happy Birthday.

12:22.595 --> 12:23.962
I'm ending this right now.

12:24.013 --> 12:27.365
I'm just gonna leave early
and go home...

12:27.433 --> 12:29.367
Unless...

12:29.435 --> 12:32.971
That's exactly
what she wants me to do.

12:33.039 --> 12:35.073
All right,
everybody just grab a bag

12:35.141 --> 12:36.641
and open it up

12:36.692 --> 12:38.944
and then try to find
some dirty stuff in there.

12:38.995 --> 12:40.028
What are you doing?

12:40.113 --> 12:41.363
Eagleton treats us
like garbage.

12:41.447 --> 12:42.781
We're gonna treat them
like garbage.

12:42.832 --> 12:44.416
We're gonna take
these bags of trash,

12:44.483 --> 12:46.201
and we're gonna throw it over
to their side of the park.

12:46.285 --> 12:47.669
And then we're just gonna let
the stink

12:47.753 --> 12:49.320
and the raccoons run wild.

12:49.372 --> 12:50.622
Well, isn't that

12:50.690 --> 12:54.176
just playing right
into what they think of you?

12:54.260 --> 12:56.494
Oh, my God.
What am I thinking?

12:56.546 --> 12:57.829
Let's just stop this.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.264
Put everything
back in the truck.

12:59.331 --> 13:00.999
Let's back it up.
No, no, no, no.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.034
Leslie, you promised we could
throw garbage everywhere.

13:03.102 --> 13:04.553
Wow.

13:04.637 --> 13:07.556
I didn't expect to see
the whole Parks Department here,

13:07.640 --> 13:08.857
although it is, sadly,

13:08.941 --> 13:10.942
one of the nicest spots
in town.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.978
I am so sick of this, Lindsay.

13:13.045 --> 13:15.197
Wait, Leslie.
I've got this.

13:15.281 --> 13:18.450
You listen to me,
Lindsay Carlisle Shay.

13:18.517 --> 13:20.185
Why don't you take
your fancy dog,

13:20.236 --> 13:21.586
get in your escalade?

13:21.654 --> 13:23.521
And if you have
any job openings,

13:23.573 --> 13:24.823
maybe you should let me
know about 'em.

13:24.874 --> 13:26.524
- Come on, man.
- No!

13:26.576 --> 13:28.426
I'm sick of being treated

13:28.494 --> 13:32.363
like I'm not willing to relocate
to Eagleton, because I am!

13:32.415 --> 13:35.217
So here's
what you could do, lady.

13:35.301 --> 13:37.368
Take this resume

13:37.420 --> 13:39.537
and shove it
into your human resources slot.

13:41.557 --> 13:43.892
Oh, yeah!
Shove it there!

13:45.344 --> 13:49.431
You might have a fancy car
and a mahogany purse,

13:49.515 --> 13:50.899
or whatever rich people have,

13:50.983 --> 13:53.268
but I remember something
that you're trying to forget.

13:53.352 --> 13:55.220
- You're a Pawnee girl.
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.271 --> 13:57.656
No, Leslie, I'm not.

13:57.723 --> 13:59.524
Well, then why do you
come here at dinnertime

13:59.575 --> 14:01.743
and get takeout
from the legendary JJ's Diner?

14:01.827 --> 14:03.695
It's not for me.

14:03.746 --> 14:06.665
These waffles make
great dog laxatives.

14:06.732 --> 14:08.833
Don't you dare

14:08.901 --> 14:11.369
feed that waffle to that dog
to get it to poop.

14:13.239 --> 14:14.539
Sambuca need to make?

14:14.590 --> 14:15.924
There you go.

14:16.008 --> 14:18.043
- Leslie.
- How dare you?

14:18.110 --> 14:19.511
- Get her!
- Get her, Leslie!

14:19.578 --> 14:21.379
- Get off of me!
- Get her!

14:23.082 --> 14:25.150
Garbage fight!

14:29.218 --> 14:31.417
I want her arrested for
attempted murder.

14:31.780 --> 14:32.781
For God's sake, Knope.
Get a grip.

14:32.848 --> 14:34.799
Thank God you're here!

14:34.884 --> 14:36.451
I want her arrested!

14:36.519 --> 14:37.836
She attacked me,

14:37.920 --> 14:40.255
and then she hurled my
Kate Spade headband somewhere.

14:40.306 --> 14:42.173
I think my Eagleton
colleagues would agree

14:42.241 --> 14:43.791
that we don't want to make
a federal case out of this,

14:43.843 --> 14:45.694
so I suggest you both apologize
to each other,

14:45.761 --> 14:47.762
and we pretend
this never happened.

14:47.813 --> 14:49.648
I will never apologize to her.

14:49.732 --> 14:51.700
- Nor I her.
- "Nor I her."

14:51.767 --> 14:54.903
I doth proclaim to be
a stupid fartface.

14:54.971 --> 14:57.322
Nice retort. Did G.B. Shaw
write that for you?

14:57.406 --> 14:59.157
Did G.B. Shaw write
your stupid fartface?

14:59.241 --> 15:01.159
Ladies, if you don't apologize,

15:01.243 --> 15:03.311
we're gonna have to toss
the both of you in jail.

15:03.379 --> 15:06.848
So just swallow your pride...

15:06.916 --> 15:09.217
Say you're sorry.

15:16.459 --> 15:17.842
We hope you enjoy
your evening here

15:17.927 --> 15:19.260
at the Eagleton holding cell.

15:19.578 --> 15:22.146
Can I offer you anything...
herbal tea, Greek yogurt?

15:22.214 --> 15:23.414
No.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.269
Morning, Ron.

15:28.354 --> 15:31.522
Ooh, dude, you forgot
to put a shirt on.

15:31.590 --> 15:32.824
I do it all the time.
It's fine.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.143
- I slept here.
- Sweet.

15:35.227 --> 15:38.763
So a little birdie told me
it's your birthday coming up.

15:38.831 --> 15:40.231
How about
a free birthday shoe shine?

15:40.282 --> 15:41.899
What did this
little birdie tell you

15:41.967 --> 15:44.135
is going to happen
for my birthday?

15:44.203 --> 15:46.271
Oh, nice try, Ron. You're not
getting anything out of me.

15:46.338 --> 15:47.839
Andrew, please.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.576
Ron, look,
I love you like a father

15:51.644 --> 15:53.578
who's not that much
older than me...

15:53.646 --> 15:54.779
like a young Uncle...

15:54.847 --> 15:57.048
or like, uh, you were
my camp counselor,

15:57.116 --> 15:58.916
but we're adults,
so we hang out,

15:58.968 --> 16:00.184
and it's not weird, you know.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.803
Or, actually,
here's what it is.

16:01.887 --> 16:03.988
You're my Lacrosse coach.
I get it. I get it.

16:04.056 --> 16:05.223
What's the point?

16:05.291 --> 16:07.292
Well, coach,

16:07.359 --> 16:09.677
Leslie swore me to secrecy,
so I can't say anything.

16:09.762 --> 16:11.679
I owe her so much.
I can't ruin it for her.

16:11.764 --> 16:15.433
- Well, I respect that.
- Mm-hmm.

16:15.501 --> 16:16.684
- See you later.
- Okay...

16:16.769 --> 16:19.604
Not if I see you first,
Uncle Ron.

16:19.672 --> 16:21.272
And I probably will,

16:21.323 --> 16:25.076
'cause Leslie assigned me
to the kidnap squad.

16:28.646 --> 16:29.681
Hey, jailbird.

16:29.748 --> 16:32.667
Beautiful Ann, thank you
for coming to get me.

16:32.751 --> 16:34.035
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

16:34.119 --> 16:35.653
Are you okay?

16:35.704 --> 16:39.340
It was a rough night,
but I survived.

16:39.425 --> 16:41.158
Scone?

16:41.210 --> 16:44.796
- They only have maple walnut.
- Yeah. Thank you.

16:44.863 --> 16:47.065
Why did you get arrested?
What did you do?

16:47.132 --> 16:49.834
The only thing I'm guilty of
is loving Pawnee...

16:49.902 --> 16:51.803
And punching Lindsay
in the face

16:51.870 --> 16:54.022
and shoving a coffee filter
down her pants.

16:54.106 --> 16:56.808
But in my defense, I believe
that assault should be legal

16:56.875 --> 16:58.142
if a person is a jerk.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.228
Why are you letting her
get to you like this?

17:00.312 --> 17:02.680
Because she's a stupid jerk...

17:02.748 --> 17:04.382
Because we were best friends

17:04.450 --> 17:06.651
and then she sold out
everything that we believed in.

17:06.719 --> 17:07.785
And the worst part?

17:07.853 --> 17:09.287
To her, our friendship...

17:09.355 --> 17:10.722
it's like it never happened.

17:10.789 --> 17:13.124
Well, first of all,
this color looks amazing on you.

17:13.192 --> 17:14.325
Thank you.

17:14.393 --> 17:16.060
Second of all,
the whole fence thing...

17:16.111 --> 17:18.128
she's obviously trying
to get a rise out of you.

17:18.196 --> 17:20.998
Third of all, she knows
she only got the job

17:21.066 --> 17:23.166
because you turned it down,
which must drive her nuts.

17:23.234 --> 17:26.253
But most importantly,
you say the word,

17:26.338 --> 17:29.474
and I will beat her senseless
with a baseball bat.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.642
Thank you.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.911
Wait a minute.

17:33.979 --> 17:35.763
Oh, my God. Okay, we have
a lot of work to do.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.082
Ann, put these scones
in your bra.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.267
- Let's go.
- Okay.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.219
Can we just stop off
at the, um, lobby?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.638
'Cause the prison gift bags
are amazing.

17:43.722 --> 17:45.189
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.858
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter.

17:46.925 --> 17:47.975
Hey, batter, bah.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.996
Lucas with a crazy base hit!

17:52.064 --> 17:54.098
Dude, stop rooting
for the other team.

17:54.149 --> 17:56.451
You're just mad 'cause
they are lighting you up.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.669
- What's going on here?
- Hi, Lindsay.

17:58.737 --> 18:00.872
Introducing the Pawnee
wiffle ball league.

18:00.939 --> 18:02.407
It's an idea
that I came up with

18:02.458 --> 18:03.875
after my best friend, Ann,
over there

18:03.942 --> 18:05.827
said she wanted to bash your
head in with a baseball bat.

18:05.911 --> 18:07.995
And I want to thank you
for the fence.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.048
There's no way we could afford
that high-quality wood.

18:11.116 --> 18:12.583
What if someone
hits a home run?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.001
How will you get the ball back?

18:14.086 --> 18:16.187
One of the many
Eagleton kids who signed up

18:16.255 --> 18:19.841
will just pop over and grab it.

18:19.925 --> 18:21.342
Hey, what are you doing
tonight?

18:21.427 --> 18:23.177
- Why?
- I don't know.

18:23.262 --> 18:25.463
I thought maybe you could bust
out your old jazz sweatshirt,

18:25.514 --> 18:27.899
and you and I could go
to Sullivan's for a beer.

18:27.966 --> 18:30.184
Yeah, I do still have
that sweatshirt.

18:30.269 --> 18:31.502
I know you do.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.571
Foul ball!

18:33.638 --> 18:36.073
- You did all this in a day?
- Yeah.

18:36.141 --> 18:37.241
All right.

18:37.309 --> 18:38.693
I work with some
really great people.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.115
Good job, guys.
Great job.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.535
Hey, did you hear the news?

18:47.619 --> 18:50.455
Ben and Chris want us to go
into Conference Room "C"

18:50.522 --> 18:51.522
for a meeting.

18:51.590 --> 18:54.208
Let's get this over with.

19:02.167 --> 19:05.203
Happy Birthday, Ron.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.438
Ann said you had a big party...

19:07.506 --> 19:09.173
sombreros, karaoke.

19:09.241 --> 19:10.575
Yeah, I did that for Ann.

19:10.642 --> 19:13.511
Why would I throw Ron Swanson
an Ann Perkins party?

19:13.579 --> 19:16.680
What about the giant list
of things April was doing?

19:16.732 --> 19:18.950
That was just a list
of ways to mess with you.

19:19.017 --> 19:21.686
- She do 'em all?
- She did indeed.

19:23.322 --> 19:26.657
So I have rented
<i>Bridge on the River Kwai</i>

19:26.708 --> 19:27.792
and <i>The Dirty Dozen.</i>

19:29.044 --> 19:30.962
Artie from security
is outside the door,

19:31.029 --> 19:32.663
so no one will bother you.

19:32.731 --> 19:34.999
And a cab will be here
whenever you're ready

19:35.067 --> 19:36.334
to take you home.

19:38.203 --> 19:39.637
Thank you.

19:39.705 --> 19:42.673
Do you remember what you
said to me five years ago

19:42.741 --> 19:44.308
when Eagleton offered me
that job,

19:44.376 --> 19:45.943
and I asked you
for your advice?

19:46.011 --> 19:47.945
Uh, "do whatever
the hell you want.

19:48.013 --> 19:48.980
What do I care?"

19:49.047 --> 19:50.848
Right, but then, after,

19:50.916 --> 19:53.150
when I pressed you,
what did you say?

19:54.218 --> 19:55.486
I believe I said

19:55.554 --> 19:57.438
that I thought
we worked well together

19:57.523 --> 20:00.892
and that I might disagree
with your philosophy,

20:00.959 --> 20:02.894
but I respected you.

20:02.961 --> 20:04.428
And I said that you'll get

20:04.496 --> 20:07.198
a lot of job offers
in your life,

20:07.266 --> 20:09.267
but you only have one hometown.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.801
Yes.

20:10.869 --> 20:13.271
That's how I remember it.

20:16.575 --> 20:19.410
This, by the way,
is a one-time-only situation.

20:19.478 --> 20:22.813
Next year, your birthday party
is gonna be a rager.

20:29.136 --> 20:30.469
Mmm!
