WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.256
WOMAN:
Do you want me to sit here?

00:03.300 --> 00:04.699
MAN:
No, here is fine.

00:04.740 --> 00:05.957
You're Kristen Balko?Yes.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.956
And you're VP
of Information Security

00:08.000 --> 00:08.989
at Running Milk?

00:09.050 --> 00:10.176
KRISTEN:
That's right.

00:10.220 --> 00:11.778
Um, is this part of the test?

00:11.830 --> 00:13.047
No, just the
pre-test.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.263
Think of this as
a practice run.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.220
We gather some
background information,

00:18.270 --> 00:20.010
then go over the questions
you'll be asked.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.277
You're gonna tell me
the questions on the test

00:21.320 --> 00:23.106
before the test?That's right.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.050
Isn't that cheating?
[chuckles]

00:25.110 --> 00:28.193
Uh, no, it isn't like
the movies, Ms. Balko.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.231
There are no
"gotcha moments."

00:30.290 --> 00:32.326
You'll know every
question beforehand.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.541
Okay, got it.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.069
Fire away.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.554
Have you ever shared
confidential materials

00:38.600 --> 00:41.068
with individuals not employed
with Running Milk?

00:41.120 --> 00:42.553
No, never.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.864
Am I supposed to answer?

00:44.910 --> 00:46.468
Anything you want.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.863
Have you ever stolen
anything from your workplace?

00:48.910 --> 00:50.559
Neven

00:50.610 --> 00:51.918
Have you ever lied
to the company?

00:51.960 --> 00:54.747
No.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.519
I lied.

00:56.570 --> 00:59.789
You didsteal materials
from the workplace?

00:59.840 --> 01:03.276
No, I lied by saying I
never lied to the company.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.274
Could you be more specific?

01:07.320 --> 01:09.754
When I applied,
in my rsum I told them

01:09.800 --> 01:12.018
that I worked as
a VP of Information Technology

01:12.070 --> 01:14.026
at a previous company.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.937
But there was no VP of
Information Technology.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.800
LUCCA: Oh, that's it?Yes, what do you mean?

01:18.860 --> 01:21.420
They fired you because you said
you were a VP on your rsum?

01:21.470 --> 01:24.553
No, they fired me because I lied
in the lie detector test.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.683
But that wasn't the point
of the lie detector test, right?

01:27.730 --> 01:30.381
They were trying
to find someone who stole

01:30.430 --> 01:32.125
confidential materials.
Right.

01:32.170 --> 01:33.649
And you didn't do that.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.600
Did you try to explain that
to your boss?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.605
Yes, but they said I
lied to the company,

01:37.660 --> 01:39.139
so they could fire me.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.613
That's why I'm suing.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.446
Silicon Valley's
a very provincial town.

01:42.490 --> 01:44.310
I can't get a job anywhere.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.578
Well, The Polygraph Protection
Act keeps an employer

01:46.620 --> 01:48.576
from forcing you to take
a lie detector test,

01:48.630 --> 01:50.791
but there are exceptions.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.888
Theft.Uh, Kristen, this is
our investigator Jason.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.626
KRISTEN: Hi. ButI
didn't steal anything.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.808
Yes, but it was the reason
for the polygraph.

01:58.850 --> 02:01.637
They caught you
in another lie, but...

02:01.680 --> 02:02.897
They need corroborating
evidence.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.464
Right.

02:04.510 --> 02:07.115
And they couldn't have fired her
unless they already

02:07.170 --> 02:10.469
had some evidence
that she lied on her rsum.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.908
Did they, Kristen?

02:11.950 --> 02:13.167
Have evidence I lied?

02:13.220 --> 02:15.120
No, I don't think so.

02:15.170 --> 02:16.990
The whole point of the polygraph

02:17.040 --> 02:18.780
was about this theft.

02:18.830 --> 02:22.482
Okay, um, why don't you give us
the day to think about it?

02:22.530 --> 02:24.486
Actually, I don't have a day.
Mr. Canning told me

02:24.530 --> 02:26.521
you'd be able to move
faster than he could.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.447
Louis Canning?
Yes.

02:29.490 --> 02:31.754
He already filed the suit, but
he got busy with another case,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.439
and he thought you'd be
good to take it over.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.492
I'm sure he did.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.282
All right, I will see if they
have any corroborating evidence.

02:40.330 --> 02:41.934
Good, a polygraph can't be
the sole basis for firing.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.936
So what--
cap my work off

02:43.980 --> 02:45.151
at five hours?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.464
Yeah.
Okay.

02:47.510 --> 02:49.466
So, what did you find out
about insurance?

02:49.510 --> 02:50.898
Oh, yeah.

02:50.950 --> 02:52.554
Malpractice insurance
is a fortune,

02:52.600 --> 02:54.204
but we could bundle it.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.909
I can get a rider to
your homeowner's policy,

02:55.950 --> 02:59.602
and just split the
increase in your premium?

02:59.650 --> 03:02.346
Will the coverage
extend to Jason?

03:02.390 --> 03:04.392
No, he's a freelancer.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.748
I don't think
it's a problem.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.485
Did you know he used
to be a lawyer?

03:07.530 --> 03:08.701
No.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.354
He practiced in New Jersey.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.356
He was disbarr_ed_
for a crImInal convrctlon.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.539
He punched a judge.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.229
[laughs]:
He punched a judge?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.497
Yep.
Why?

03:17.540 --> 03:19.622
I guess he didn't
like his decision.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.365
And you're worried
about the insurance?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.366
Yeah, if Jason

03:23.420 --> 03:24.580
beats up someone
on the job...

03:24.630 --> 03:26.188
Yeah, well, due diligence.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.548
We should find out
what happened.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.729
Okay, I'm gonna call New Jersey.[phone buzzing]

03:29.770 --> 03:31.726
See if I can talk to the judge.
What's up, Eli?

03:31.770 --> 03:33.590
What's the best thing
about Peter?

03:33.640 --> 03:35.039
Excuse me?

03:35.080 --> 03:36.388
I need a quote from you
for Peter's bio.

03:36.430 --> 03:38.250
Do you need it to be true?

03:38.300 --> 03:39.733
True adjacent.

03:39.780 --> 03:40.769
Peter's motto is

03:40.820 --> 03:42.162
"Service above self.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.562
"My family has
benefitted from it,

03:43.610 --> 03:44.599
now America can."

03:44.650 --> 03:46.208
Eli, that's...

03:46.260 --> 03:48.399
I know, it's nauseating.
Help me out.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.691
Eli?

03:49.750 --> 03:50.739
Over here.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.611
Just a second, Alicia.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.538
I thought this was
a staff meeting.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.184
It is.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.310
Turn off your cell phone

03:59.360 --> 04:01.624
and I'll turn off mine.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.843
What is it?An Alabama Slammer.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.286
[coughs]
[laughs]

04:07.330 --> 04:08.627
Yeah.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.022
I like them strong.

04:10.070 --> 04:12.288
Confusion to our enemies.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.893
[breathlessly]: So, what are
we discussing, Ruth?

04:15.950 --> 04:18.555
What makes Eli Gold tick?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.158
[quiet laugh]

04:20.210 --> 04:21.689
Uh, I know how this works, Ruth.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.425
Unless you're
trying to seduce me,

04:23.480 --> 04:26.085
which I very much doubt,

04:26.130 --> 04:28.303
you get me drunk,
you pretend to be drunk

04:28.350 --> 04:30.739
and you find out more about me
than I find out about you.

04:30.790 --> 04:34.135
[laughs]: Oh, Eli,
you're too suspicious.

04:34.180 --> 04:35.909
You're a new tree in my forest.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.699
I want to know more
about that tree, that's all.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.446
Because unless I chop it down,

04:40.490 --> 04:42.708
that tree's _
now part of my life.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.445
So. ..
My grandfather,

04:45.500 --> 04:47.320
Samuel Gold,

04:47.370 --> 04:49.235
was a teamster
organizer In Brooklyn.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.328
Everything I learned,
I learned from him.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.634
I remember going to visit him
in his office when I was little.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.467
All the people
coming to kiss his ring.

04:56.510 --> 04:59.468
Looking for advice, for help.

04:59.510 --> 05:01.762
And he told me

05:01.820 --> 05:03.515
that the most powerful men

05:03.560 --> 05:06.028
are the ones that
no one knows eXIst.

05:07.610 --> 05:09.259
[laughing]

05:10.570 --> 05:12.128
Is something funny?

05:12.180 --> 05:13.568
Oh, yeah.
What?

05:13.610 --> 05:14.918
None of that was true.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.656
Your grandfather
was Ira Goldstein,

05:17.700 --> 05:19.964
owner of a schmatta business
In Queens.

05:20.010 --> 05:22.570
He died a pauper after
his brother-in-law cheated him

05:22.620 --> 05:25.441
out of a uniform consignment
with the NYPD.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.367
And that quote?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.310
You changed it.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.452
It's from The Usual Suspects.

05:32.850 --> 05:34.499
So, what do you want, Ruth?

05:34.550 --> 05:37.018
Why are you pretending
to care about me?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.938
We got new internals
from this afternoon.

05:40.990 --> 05:44.551
Peter made another
four pomt bump.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.330
That's more than a fluke,
that's a trend.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.039
We broke through.
We have a shot.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.640
And not just
at the vice presidency.

05:51.690 --> 05:53.829
We could win.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.565
Things turn sour
for Hillary--

05:55.610 --> 05:57.953
the e-mails, the next thing
they throw at her-- we win.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.695
But we need to be rowing
in the same direction.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.786
This goes the way
we all want,

06:01.830 --> 06:04.617
they'll be enough
to carve up for both of us.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.480
You see that, right?I do.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.189
So the strategy's changed.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.619
We're not being kind and
deferential to the frontrunner.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.490
We're acting like
the frontrunner.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.327
We're not aiming
for the vice presidency.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.758
We're aiming
for the presidency.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.892
So, what do you need from me?

06:18.940 --> 06:22.194
We're moving up
the announcement to Thursday.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.592
We want to take advantage
of the momentum.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.198
You need Alicia?

06:25.250 --> 06:27.332
Yes, much more
than we originally agreed.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.245
Voters need to see
these two together.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.813
Young, vibrant,
looking toward the future.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.555
Jackie O to his JFK.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.682
We need to work together, Eli.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.900
You need to trust me.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.474
And I need to trust you.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.654
[indistinct chatter]

06:49.930 --> 06:51.795
Who's that?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.831
I don't know.
Silicon Valley lawyer?

06:53.890 --> 06:56.620
Hello.
Alice Florrick, yes?

06:56.670 --> 06:58.797
Yes.
Andrea Stevens.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.977
It's so nice to meet you.
I was told you were

07:01.020 --> 07:02.578
the opposing counsel.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.972
It just makes it
so much more exciting

07:04.030 --> 07:05.895
when you respect the opposition,
don't you think?

07:05.940 --> 07:07.931
It does.
Hello.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.070
Hi. Lucca Quinn.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.894
Hi. I love your hair.

07:10.950 --> 07:13.771
How many years are you
out of law school, Lucca?

07:13.820 --> 07:15.299
A few.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.388
Well, that's better
than less than a few.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.647
SHERIFF:
All rise.

07:18.690 --> 07:20.476
Oh, here we go.Court is now in session.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.476
Lucca, if you ever
want any advice.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.078
JUDGE:
Good afternoon.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.872
I've read your
preliminary motions.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.912
I would like to take up the,
uh, jurisdictional question.

07:29.970 --> 07:31.835
[both speaking over each other]

07:31.880 --> 07:34.053
Your Honor, the plaintiff
lives in Chicago...

07:34.100 --> 07:36.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[whoops]

07:36.320 --> 07:39.881
Your Honor, I was warned
about Chicago courtrooms,

07:39.930 --> 07:41.363
but I didn't think it was

07:41.410 --> 07:42.843
gonna be about
who shouted the loudest.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.198
It isn't, Counselor.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.411
What do you have?

07:45.460 --> 07:47.416
Thank you, Your Honor.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.588
This is rank forum shopping.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.552
Mrs. Florrick knows this case
belongs in California.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.374
Running Milk has
no Chicago offices.

07:55.430 --> 07:56.681
And the lie detector test
In questIon

07:56.730 --> 07:58.163
took place in California.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.770
Kristen Balko lives in Chicago.

08:00.820 --> 08:03.038
And thanks to the cloud tax

08:03.090 --> 08:05.558
passed by
the Chicago City Council,

08:05.610 --> 08:09.137
Running Milk's offices are both
in California and Illinois.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.569
Yes, but respectfully,
Your Honor,

08:11.620 --> 08:14.578
they are not
physically in Illinois.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.758
"Brick and mortar are
things of the past.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.360
The cloud is the future."

08:22.410 --> 08:23.627
Your Honor, so many of our
witnesses will have to be

08:23.670 --> 08:25.752
flown in from San Jose
and that doesn't...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.540
And so many of our
witnesses will have

08:27.590 --> 08:29.069
to be flown in from Chicago...Your Honor, to refute these...

08:29.110 --> 08:31.192
[both talking over each other]Thank you.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.798
But as Ms. Stevens pointed out,

08:32.860 --> 08:34.851
this shouldn't be about
who shouts the loudest.

08:34.900 --> 08:35.980
Motion is denied.

08:36.030 --> 08:37.679
We'll hear the case here.

08:37.730 --> 08:39.209
Please have the Running Milk

08:39.250 --> 08:41.593
sothare spec sent to me
by end of day, thank you.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.039
[gavelbangs]

08:44.950 --> 08:47.646
Just the first skirmish.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.556
[doorbell rings]

09:27.650 --> 09:30.642
Peter wants to be president.Excuse me?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.043
Peter thinks
he can be president.

09:34.830 --> 09:37.617
I need a drink.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.355
Do you want one?

09:39.400 --> 09:40.879
No, I need to go.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.309
They moved the announcement
up to Thursday.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.611
You need to be in Springfield.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.922
I wrote you a speech;
very Michelle Obama.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.449
What time Thursday?
3:00 pm.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.626
They'll need us
more than usual.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.490
They keep mixing
their metaphors.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.145
You're either Michelle Obama
or Jackie O.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.498
Do you ever wonder
why I'm hearing this

09:56.550 --> 09:57.630
from you
and not Peter?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.669
What? No.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.800
What do you mean?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.282
Well, I'm hearing that Peter

10:01.330 --> 10:03.378
truly is running for president

10:03.420 --> 10:05.559
and that I might
be First Lady

10:05.600 --> 10:06.635
from his campaign manager.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.907
I am not his
campaIgn manager.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.076
[sighs]

10:09.130 --> 10:10.336
You think he has a chance?

10:10.390 --> 10:11.516
I don't know.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.209
I thought Trump
would self-destruct,

10:13.260 --> 10:14.648
so what do I know?

10:14.700 --> 10:16.565
Primaries are_
theIr own InsanIty.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.474
What are you making?

10:17.520 --> 10:20.648
A margarita.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.610
Tequila, triple sec.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.528
Huh.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.649
You judging me?

10:25.710 --> 10:26.654
No.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.665
That sounded
like a judgmental

10:27.710 --> 10:28.699
huh.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.058
No.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.533
You get as sloppy drunk
as you want to.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.059
[chuckles]

10:33.110 --> 10:35.055
So, what do they want me to do?

10:35.110 --> 10:36.668
Be involved.
Go on Thursday.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.802
Give a good speech.
Look First Lady-like.

10:38.850 --> 10:41.284
I got Frank Landau
to introduce you.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.548
It's not bad having the head
of the Democratic committee

10:43.590 --> 10:45.239
say nice things about you.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.541
What are you doing, Eli?

10:46.600 --> 10:47.851
This doesn't
sound like you.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.946
Sure it does.

10:50.470 --> 10:51.903
No, no, no, no.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.599
You're scheming
something here.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.379
Cheers.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.386
JASON:
Hey, I've got some good news

10:57.430 --> 10:59.955
and I got some bad news--
which do you want first?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.786
Bad.
Good.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.697
Running Milk's HR team
definitely verified

11:04.750 --> 11:06.308
Kristen lied
on her rsum.
Damn.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.009
So we have no case.What's the good news?

11:08.050 --> 11:09.836
I don't think there was
a theft at Running Milk.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.314
What do you mean?

11:12.360 --> 11:14.624
A firm like Running Milk
is required to notify

11:14.670 --> 11:17.059
their customers of any
breach; they didn't.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.237
California attorney
general's got no record

11:19.280 --> 11:20.406
of any breach
at Running Milk.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.496
So they had no reason
to polygraph.

11:22.550 --> 11:24.359
Right, fruit of
the poisonous tree.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.064
Why'd you punch that judge?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.809
[coughs weakly]

11:32.860 --> 11:34.725
I was angry.

11:34.780 --> 11:35.906
Why were you angry?

11:35.950 --> 11:37.121
Don't you get angry?

11:37.170 --> 11:39.513
I do, but I don't punch people.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.042
Maybe you should start.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.526
LUCCA: As you can see,
Your Honor,

11:48.570 --> 11:50.561
Running Milk never suffered
a security breach,

11:50.620 --> 11:52.315
and since t_hat_was_
the only legal justIfIcatIon

11:52.360 --> 11:54.396
for polygraphing our client,

11:54.450 --> 11:56.441
that polygraph must
be thrown out.MARX: Is this true?

11:56.490 --> 11:58.538
Can you give me one
second, Your Honor?

11:58.580 --> 12:00.536
As you requested,

12:00.580 --> 12:02.628
uh, the CEO of Running Milk flew
in a great personal expense.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.456
I'm honored.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.412
[whispering]

12:07.460 --> 12:10.020
Without admitting
to any wrongdoing, Your Honor,

12:10.070 --> 12:11.628
Running Milk generously agrees

12:11.680 --> 12:12.931
to rehire the plaintiff
at her original salary.

12:12.990 --> 12:15.982
We just want this to be over.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.907
Really? Since when?Since an hour ago.

12:17.950 --> 12:21.386
We ask that this suit
be dismissed, Your Honor.

12:21.430 --> 12:23.159
Your Honor,
if our client is rehired,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.438
she can't be subjected to a
new polygraph, is that correct?

12:25.480 --> 12:26.469
Yes, private employers
are barred

12:26.520 --> 12:28.476
from making polygraphs

12:28.530 --> 12:30.475
a condition
of employment.

12:30.530 --> 12:31.952
ALICIA: May we have a
ruling on that, Your Honor?

12:32.010 --> 12:33.352
Um, can... I'm-I'm sorry,
can I just have

12:33.400 --> 12:34.435
one more second,
Your Honor?

12:34.490 --> 12:36.390
[whispering]

12:36.450 --> 12:38.395
Actually, polygraphs
may be applied

12:38.450 --> 12:39.963
to employees engaged
in counterintelligence

12:40.020 --> 12:42.534
or_ national
securIty functIons,

12:42.580 --> 12:47.108
pursuant to a contract
with the federal government.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.629
Your Honor, our client
has no connection

12:48.680 --> 12:49.715
with national security.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.193
And again I ask for a ruling.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.969
These contracts show

12:53.030 --> 12:55.498
that Running Milk has ongoing
accounts with the government.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.279
ALICIA:
This makes no sense.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.557
If these contracts
were the reason

12:58.600 --> 13:00.682
for these polygraph tests,

13:00.730 --> 13:04.257
then why create the fiction
of a security breach?

13:04.300 --> 13:06.951
Are we really wondering
why the National Security Agency

13:07.000 --> 13:08.604
might have a need
for secrecy?

13:08.650 --> 13:10.379
LUCCA: Your Honor, the
defendant just plans

13:10.440 --> 13:12.567
to rehire _our client so
they can ﬁre her agaIn.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.601
Yes, but legally.

13:14.660 --> 13:15.957
These c_ontracts
appear In order.

13:16.010 --> 13:18.478
Before Miss Balko
starts work again,

13:18.530 --> 13:20.259
she'll need to submit
to a polygraph.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.309
[gavelbangs]

13:21.360 --> 13:24.011
ELI:
Your Honor.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.665
I don't have time for this, Eli.

13:26.710 --> 13:27.881
Even for a friend?

13:27.930 --> 13:29.716
If you're wearing a wire,

13:29.760 --> 13:31.489
you have to tell me,
or it'll be thrown out in court.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.327
I am not wearing a wire.

13:34.370 --> 13:35.632
I need your help.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.671
I would never
have taken that bribe.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.199
I didn't need you
to warn me.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.945
But I did warn you.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.424
[sighs]
What? What do you need?

13:43.470 --> 13:45.426
Information on Frank Landau

13:45.470 --> 13:48.291
and his manipulation of voting
machines in the last election.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.080
No, I won't betray him.He won't know it's you.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.519
I just need the proof from you,
and I'll do the rest.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.656
What are you up to?

14:08.150 --> 14:09.139
RECEPTIONIST:
Please hold.

14:09.190 --> 14:11.055

14:19.380 --> 14:21.325

14:29.650 --> 14:31.163
WOMAN: Monica Timmons?

14:33.780 --> 14:36.738
You won't mind working
at a big law firm?

14:36.780 --> 14:39.522
No, I think I'd
like the challenge.

14:39.570 --> 14:40.525
Where are you
from originally?

14:40.570 --> 14:41.525
Maryland.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.561
Oh, Maryland.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.225
Baltimore?
Yes.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.488
Tough neighborhood.

14:48.530 --> 14:51.181
No.

14:51.230 --> 14:52.447
Loyola.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.751
We don't see many applicants

14:53.800 --> 14:55.233
from that law school.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.532
I think it's
underrated, actually.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.627
Professor Edmund Kindle, who
clerked for Justice Kennedy...

15:00.680 --> 15:01.624
Never heard of him.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.580
He's a fantastic scholar.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.800
He was my mentor.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.804
How nice.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.761
Thanks
for coming in.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.902
We don't get to see many
black lawyers in here.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.680
How old are
you, honey?

15:13.730 --> 15:15.732
Twenty-six.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.998
What, are you, uh,
Nigerian, or what?

15:19.390 --> 15:20.607
What.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.606
[chuckles]

15:22.660 --> 15:25.561
Hey, you're a sassy
one, aren't you?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.611
I try to be.
Let me ask you
a question

15:27.660 --> 15:31.391
that I ask
all the summer interns.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.964
If you were
on a desert island...

15:34.020 --> 15:36.534
I'm glad you came in
today, Monica.

15:36.580 --> 15:37.922
MONICA:
I'm glad I did, too.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.925
We need fighters
in here.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.881
So you're
from Maryland?

15:42.940 --> 15:44.362
Yes.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.671
Baltimore?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.153
That's right.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.191
You have to be tough
to grow up there?

15:50.860 --> 15:53.374
DIANE:
Monica Timmons, I like her.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.642
No, easy pass.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.738
DIANE:
I know she didn't go
to a top-tier law school.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.294
_ DAVID: _
Top tIer? Loyola barely made It
to second tier.

16:01.350 --> 16:02.692
I like Monica, too,

16:02.740 --> 16:04.173
but I do worry
about her LSATs.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.778
I thought you wanted
new talent, Cary.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.263
Yeah, and we have it

16:07.310 --> 16:09.562
in Brian, John Michael
and, um...

16:09.620 --> 16:11.656
the other one.You mean the three
that looked like you?

16:11.700 --> 16:13.873
That has nothing
to do with it.We need some diversity.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.615
These three are the topAt this firm,
every young face

16:15.670 --> 16:17.001
of their classes.looks like every other one.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.539
Excuse me.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.629
Uh, I'm for the black girl.

16:21.670 --> 16:24.013
I'm gonna regret this,

16:24.070 --> 16:26.368
but is there a reason you
want to hire a candidate

16:26.420 --> 16:28.149
significantly less
qualified than the others?

16:28.200 --> 16:31.499
She's black, she's suffered,
like my people.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.893
We don't hire on the
basis of race, Howard.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.077
Thought we were
on the same side.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.075
You are on the same side.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.075
You're both for dipping.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.075
We are not in for dipping.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.519
This isn't about dipping.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.993
DAVID: Yes...
that's the truth.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.429
You want to dip our standards.[overlapping chatter]

16:43.480 --> 16:46.165
[Alicia, Lucca and Andrea
talk over each other]

16:46.220 --> 16:48.040
Your Honor, as much
as I appreciate

16:48.090 --> 16:50.081
the opposition's
passion,

16:50.130 --> 16:51.688
you have already validated
our governmental contracts,

16:51.740 --> 16:53.788
so I'm not sure why...LUCCA: Yes, but
the mere existence

16:53.830 --> 16:55.525
of those contracts does not mean

16:55.570 --> 16:57.049
that our client was engaged
in such work.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.398
I'm not sure I understand.

16:59.450 --> 17:00.667
Can you name which
of her projects falls

17:00.710 --> 17:02.143
under the EPPA exception?

17:02.190 --> 17:04.977
Your Honor, uh...

17:05.020 --> 17:07.329
I_a_m stunned at the
canCIsm on dIsplay here.

17:07.370 --> 17:09.326
Mrs. Florrick knows

17:09.370 --> 17:11.622
my client's contracts preclude
me from going into detail.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.636
No one here has security
clearance to hear the details.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.284
So we just have
to trust you.

17:15.330 --> 17:17.764
No, you have to trust
the United States government.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.687
Running Milk has already
misled this court.

17:19.730 --> 17:21.686
Yes, but this isn't about
Running Milk anymore.

17:21.730 --> 17:23.721
This is about national security.

17:23.780 --> 17:25.736
So the polygraph will proceed.

to echo Obama's In every way.

overcoat for Peter.

17:42.230 --> 17:45.700
I mean the exact same one that
Obama wore-- and Alicia, too.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.445
The whole point, people,
is to get the press

17:48.500 --> 17:50.456
to put the two photos
side-by-side.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.717
Obama and Peter.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.546
[door opens]PETER: Sorry to interrupt.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.581
[cheering]

17:57.900 --> 17:59.856
Thank you for
your enthusiasm.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.152
Let's not jinx
those polls.[laughing]

18:02.210 --> 18:04.940
Okay, so, um,
this race is in flux,

18:04.990 --> 18:06.332
and I can tell you that
because I feel it

18:06.380 --> 18:08.769
out there on the trail,
and it's because

18:08.820 --> 18:10.344
of all the hard work
we've been doing,

18:10.390 --> 18:11.687
but now we have
to double down.

18:11.740 --> 18:14.129
I want every voter
in this country

18:14.180 --> 18:17.047
to see who I am,
where I'm from,

18:17.090 --> 18:18.569
and why I'm doing this.

18:18.610 --> 18:19.827
Thank you again.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.177
[whooping]

18:21.230 --> 18:23.448
No luck with
Leahy or Durbin?

18:23.490 --> 18:25.219
Uh, they're
endorsing Hillary.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.828
We could go
with a state senator.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.405
Well, that makes it too
much of an Illinois affair.

18:29.450 --> 18:31.668
There is one idea
we could try.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.237
Eli, could you step
in here a minute?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.622
Mr. Governor.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.159
Well, I'm glad to see

18:38.200 --> 18:39.758
that you two are working
so well together.

18:39.810 --> 18:41.846
Oh, we had
our dtente drink.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.199
Um, Eli wanted Frank Landau
to introduce Alicia.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.208
It's a good idea-- he's well
respected in Democratic circles,

18:48.250 --> 18:50.775
and Eli wrote him
an excellent speech.PETER: Sounds good.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.549
But I'm wondering if
Landau would be better

18:52.600 --> 18:53.817
to introduce you,
Mr. Governor.

18:53.870 --> 18:55.553
If you'd be all
right with that.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.601
Of course,
I'm here to serve.

18:57.650 --> 18:59.174
I've seen
Landau speak.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.131
He gives a true
barnburner.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.480
She stole Landau
from you.

19:07.530 --> 19:08.747
How is it you can lurk

19:08.790 --> 19:10.667
in an office the size
of a phone booth?

19:10.710 --> 19:12.484
Ruth stole
Landau from you

19:12.540 --> 19:13.791
and yet you
seem happy, Eli.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.920
What's that about?

19:14.970 --> 19:16.710
I'm a good person.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.409
No.

19:18.460 --> 19:19.711
You're setting Peter up.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.763
I want to be left alone
with my thoughts.

19:24.810 --> 19:27.062
I thought you wanted to
destroy Ruth, not Peter.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.542
Sometimes to stop
the cancer,

19:28.600 --> 19:29.589
you have to endanger
the patient.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.119
Oh, my God.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.331
You're like an evil scientist.

19:37.430 --> 19:40.388
What are you
endangering Peter with?

19:40.440 --> 19:43.659
Landau rigged the voting
machines in the last election.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.429
He'll have his arm around Peter

19:45.480 --> 19:47.482
at the biggest moment
of his career.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.390
That'll leave a mark.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.656
[phone line rings]

19:52.710 --> 19:54.189
MAN [over phone]: Hello?ALICIA: Judge Hess.

19:54.230 --> 19:55.401
Alicia Florrick.

19:55.450 --> 19:57.964
Thank you taking
the time to speak with me.

19:58.020 --> 20:01.194
Certainly. You said you had some
questions about Jason Crouse?

20:01.240 --> 20:04.971
I do. I'm conducting background
checks on private investigators.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.454
Yes, I'd heard
he moved to Chicago.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.455
I was wondering if you could
shed some light

20:09.510 --> 20:12.240
on the incident
that got him disbarred.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.246
Are you thinking
of hiring him, ma'am?

20:14.300 --> 20:15.551
We are.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.556
Well, then I have
a few words of advice.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.079
Do you have a pen?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.348
I do.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.346
No, no, no, no, no.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.869
And no.

20:24.910 --> 20:26.389
He's a ticking time bomb.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.396
He will smile,
he will tell you jokes,

20:28.440 --> 20:31.398
and you'll even think you're
dealing with a normal person,

20:31.440 --> 20:33.829
then he'll explode
when you least expect it.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.189
Um, that was several years ago.HESS: Yes.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.403
Have you read the book
The Sociopath Next Door?

20:38.450 --> 20:40.441
I haven't.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.446
One out of every 25 people
are sociopaths.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.752
They don't have the gene
that leads to compassion.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.756
They can fake being
a normal person,

20:47.810 --> 20:50.370
but deep down, they aren't.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.376
They may not murder,
they may not rape,

20:52.420 --> 20:56.629
but they will eat away
your life from the inside.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.419
That is Jason Crouse.

20:58.470 --> 21:01.462
And my advice to you,
ma'am, is run.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.689
But did you participate
in Go Pro?

21:05.740 --> 21:07.696
Yes, everyone did.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.913
JASON: And did you have
a passion project?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.860
LUCCA: Kristen and her
coworkers were encouraged

21:11.920 --> 21:13.524
to have side projects,

21:13.570 --> 21:15.526
and there's a chance _that
one of these SIde pr0jects

21:15.570 --> 21:17.299
was the reason
she got ﬁred.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.828
Well, I was working on a
relationship-mapping app.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.609
Sorry, what...
what is that?

21:21.670 --> 21:24.138
It's a way to create
diagrams of relationships

21:24.190 --> 21:29.105
between concepts, ideas, people
and other pieces of information.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.493
I found a way to cross-
platform on JavaScript

21:31.550 --> 21:33.768
for an app
I called Spoiler.What's Spoiler?

21:33.810 --> 21:36.540
It analyzes the pilot
episode of a new TV series

21:36.590 --> 21:38.546
and predicts stuff
about the story,

21:38.600 --> 21:42.559
like who will sleep with who
and who will get killed off.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.511
So it's predictive.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.334
Yes. Why?

21:46.390 --> 21:49.553
Did anyone say it might
be used by the NSA?

21:49.610 --> 21:52.340
No, it's a stupid
little program.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.518
It's not for
surveIIIance.

21:55.570 --> 21:57.481
LUCCA: Where are you going?To talk to someone.

21:59.180 --> 22:00.875
What's so secret you couldn't
talk on the phone?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.229
[elevator bell dings]

22:05.280 --> 22:07.794
I need to get in touch
with an old client of ours.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.583
I think he gave you information
on how to contact him?

22:13.410 --> 22:14.627
It's complicated.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.023
What isn't?

22:42.750 --> 22:44.832
All right.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.869
ALICIA:
Um, I'm a friend of Cary's.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.911
You said to call
if there was anything we needed.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.303
Where are you?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.873
Chicago.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.569
All right,
did you do everything?

23:29.620 --> 23:31.269
Everything Cary said.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.402
Can I come out
from under the blanket now?

23:33.450 --> 23:35.224
Did you type the number in
under the blanket?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.235
Yes.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.235
Then yes.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.019
Uh, what do you need?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.319
CARY:
When you say potential, Diane,
what you're really talking...

23:46.380 --> 23:47.859
DIANE: Just ask me what
I'm talking about.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.208
CARY: You're talking about
the future of this firm.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.467
Yes, and Monica
is the kind of attorney

23:50.510 --> 23:52.558
I see in our future.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.635
New-law.

23:53.690 --> 23:54.907
That is where
our future IIes,

23:54.950 --> 23:56.201
in companies
like Three-Tech.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.511
The 3-D printing company?

23:57.560 --> 23:58.948
Their billable hours
are laughable.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.036
So were Chumhum's,
when they first started out.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.773
We need people like Brian
and John Michael and Ray.

24:02.830 --> 24:04.695
And I think
we should vote.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.174
I vote for the black girl.Well, you don't get
a vote, Howard.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.949
You're not _ _ _

24:09.010 --> 24:10.398

You volunteered for
the hiring committee

24:10.440 --> 24:11.350
when you were thinking
about suing.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.356
Ah, ridiculous.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.186
Okay... [clears throat] Cary.

24:15.230 --> 24:16.925
I will vote
for the guy

24:16.970 --> 24:18.494
who interned
at Silicon Systems...

24:18.540 --> 24:19.529
Brian.
Right.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.979
And, David,
I will agree

24:21.020 --> 24:22.362
to the automaton

24:22.410 --> 24:23.399
with the perfect LSATs...

24:23.460 --> 24:24.802

24:24.850 --> 24:26.158
That's not his name.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.451
The two-named guy.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.501
...if you will both agree

24:28.550 --> 24:30.586
to support Monica.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.501
I'm sorry, Diane.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.551
I just can't.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.295
[sighs]

24:36.340 --> 24:37.773
Then what will work
for you, David?

24:37.820 --> 24:39.162
Hiring the three

24:39.210 --> 24:40.427
most highly
qualified candidates.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.074
Three white guys.

24:42.130 --> 24:43.609
Two from Harvard,
one from Stanford.Yup.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.163
Do you agree?

24:45.220 --> 24:46.994
I liked Monica, Diane.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.347
I really did, but...

24:48.390 --> 24:49.391
She doesn't look
like you, right?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.135
That's not fair.

24:51.180 --> 24:54.001
A lot of things that
aren't fair are true.

24:54.050 --> 24:55.449

ANDREA:

without telling
us from whom.

24:59.670 --> 25:00.921
ALICIA:
This is a matter
of some delicacy--

25:00.970 --> 25:02.699
and national security--

25:02.760 --> 25:05.661
and we believe, for the safety
of the person on the video,

25:05.720 --> 25:08.359
advance notice places him
at unnecessary

25:08.410 --> 25:10.230

25:18.860 --> 25:20.555
ANDREA:
They want to
hear testimony

25:20.600 --> 25:22.591
from a disgraced,
poor man's Snowden?

25:22.650 --> 25:24.732
[laughs]And I want to hear it.

25:24.780 --> 25:27.829
We'll view it
In chambers

25:27.870 --> 25:29.770
and then I'll decide whether
to admit it into evidence.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.569
DELLINGER:
SpOIler has been

25:32.610 --> 25:33.690
one of the NSA's

25:33.740 --> 25:35.526
most exciting
civilian acquisitions,

25:35.570 --> 25:38.437
and although it was created
for rather banal reasons,

25:38.490 --> 25:40.481
the same infrastructure

25:40.530 --> 25:43.533
lends itself well to processing
other forms of data.

25:43.580 --> 25:47.016
Like understanding conversations
between potential terrorists

25:47.060 --> 25:49.233
and predicting
their future plots.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.329
You know, like if, uh, one
terrorist is going to get into

25:52.370 --> 25:54.361
a love triangle with
another terrorist's wife.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.376
[chuckles]
Just kidding.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.115
Sort of.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.208
[Marx chuckles]

26:00.250 --> 26:01.558
The NSA has spent
millions of dollars

26:01.600 --> 26:03.374
to secure the Spoiler app.

26:03.430 --> 26:04.499
And, in my experience,

26:04.560 --> 26:06.039
the agency and their partners

26:06.080 --> 26:08.548
will do a... a lot

26:08.610 --> 26:11.170
to protect
that kind of investment.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.903
Your Honor,

26:12.960 --> 26:15.349
Running Milk continues
to mislead this court.

26:15.390 --> 26:16.948
They sold an app
to the government--

26:17.010 --> 26:19.308
an app
my client created--

26:19.360 --> 26:20.566
then terminated her

26:20.620 --> 26:22.520
to prevent her stock
options from vesting,

26:22.580 --> 26:24.525
so she wouldn't share in_ the
proﬁt of her own InventIon.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.925
This testimony
proves nothing.

26:27.970 --> 26:29.574
They're asking the court
to take the word of a man

26:29.630 --> 26:31.586
disciplined by the NSA

26:31.630 --> 26:33.404
before fleeing to
a non-extradition country.

26:33.460 --> 26:34.973
Mr. Dellinger
has a vendetta

26:35.020 --> 26:36.931
against the NSA.
That's all this proves.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.231
Can we get
Mr. Dellinger in here?

26:38.290 --> 26:40.542
Given the NSA's reach,

26:40.590 --> 26:42.546
I couldn't ask him

26:42.600 --> 26:43.589
to put himself
at that risk.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.891
I understand.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.429
And I sympathize.

26:46.470 --> 26:47.949
But if there isn't any

26:47.990 --> 26:49.946
insoluble,
physical reason

26:49.990 --> 26:52.686
that Mr. Dellinger
can't testify in person,

26:52.740 --> 26:54.731
well, I have to agree
with Ms., uh...

26:54.780 --> 26:56.213
Stevens.I'm sorry,
but I don't see you

26:56.260 --> 26:57.739
getting out of that polygraph.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.087
Good luck.

26:59.130 --> 27:00.347
RUTH:
What?

27:00.400 --> 27:02.436
Are you kidding me?
Eli!

27:04.400 --> 27:05.788
We lost the Old State Capitol
building.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.091
What? How?

27:07.140 --> 27:08.391
There's an inter-faith

27:08.450 --> 27:09.667
break dancing competition
on the steps.

27:09.710 --> 27:10.665
Are you kidding me?

27:10.710 --> 27:11.961
We need the parallel to Obama.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.271
We need the...

27:13.320 --> 27:14.628
Well, it's not
just any steps.

27:14.670 --> 27:15.887
It's the town hall steps!

27:15.930 --> 27:17.488
The advance team.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.679
They're suggesting the steps
to the local gym.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.802
The |oca|...They say they look the same.

27:21.850 --> 27:24.284
It doesn't matter
if they look the same.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.025
It's a gym!

27:26.070 --> 27:27.810
Did Lincoln exercise there?

27:27.860 --> 27:30.203
Did he talk about a house
divided while on the treadmill?

27:30.250 --> 27:31.501
Then why are we there?

27:31.560 --> 27:32.857
Not bad.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.511
Are those crosses?

27:37.610 --> 27:39.828
No, decorative "X"s.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.383
Oh, with a decorative Jesus?

27:41.440 --> 27:42.600
Why are there crosses?

27:42.660 --> 27:44.082
It's a Catholic gym.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.823
A Catholic gym?
Is that a thing?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.780
A gym at a Catholic school.Oh.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.489
You swear you can
get the steps?

27:49.530 --> 27:52.397
Okay, then tie them down.

27:52.450 --> 27:55.317
And see if you can get
the break dancers to move.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.456
You're not screwing
with me, are you, Eli?

27:59.500 --> 28:01.536
This hurts both of us.

28:05.460 --> 28:08.190
Okay, we cover up the crosses
with a banner.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.206
Have people
on the steps.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.468
He comes up through the crowd.

28:12.510 --> 28:15.161
It could look like
the Obama announcement.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.556
I found what you
were looking for.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.739
What are you doing here?

28:20.780 --> 28:22.259
Better than you
coming to my office.

28:22.300 --> 28:26.043
Don, if you are
recording me, and I ask,

28:26.090 --> 28:27.819
you have to acknowledge it
or the recording

28:27.880 --> 28:29.825
cannot be used in a_court
of law. Are you recordIng me?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.177
No, Eli.

28:31.230 --> 28:33.653
Here's your proof.

28:33.710 --> 28:35.393
The man who
arranged the hack

28:35.450 --> 28:38.089
of the voting
machines last March,

28:38.150 --> 28:40.095
he's an old stooge
of Frank Landau's.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.538
And he'll talk?
He'll talk
to a reporter

28:41.580 --> 28:43.536
if they protect him
under the shield laws.

28:43.590 --> 28:44.750
Okay, I need him
on Thursday.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.539
Landau will introduce
the governor.

28:46.590 --> 28:48.546
Then I need this report
to come out.

28:48.590 --> 28:50.581
He'll pin it on Landau?

28:50.640 --> 28:51.675
Definitely.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.118
Landau and Peter.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.849
Excuse me?

28:57.910 --> 29:00.515
He'll pin it
on Landau and Peter.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.347
Peter Florrick?

29:03.390 --> 29:04.607
Yes.

29:04.650 --> 29:06.823
What's wrong?

29:06.870 --> 29:08.952
But Peter had nothing
to do with the hack.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.958
Yes, he did.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.046
He was worried
about his wife losing,

29:14.100 --> 29:16.136
so he set it up.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.579
What's wrong?

29:17.620 --> 29:20.134
This is good, Eli.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.226
You wanted to hobble
the governor, rIght?

29:22.280 --> 29:25.499
Well, this will knock him out.

29:25.540 --> 29:26.791
Right.

29:26.850 --> 29:28.579
So Thursday, right?

29:28.630 --> 29:29.938
You want him
to drop the bomb

29:29.980 --> 29:32.323
just after Landau
intros Peter?

29:35.250 --> 29:36.979
JASON:
Forget everything that
you've ever heard

29:37.030 --> 29:38.679
or seen on
teleVISIon.

29:38.730 --> 29:41.426
Attempts to manipulate
the data output are futile.

29:41.470 --> 29:43.165
KRISTEN:
So what do I do?

29:43.210 --> 29:45.553
Manipulate the person
reading the data.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.648
Any deviation from your
baseline stress level,

29:47.690 --> 29:49.601
doesn't make the needle
go all crazy.

29:49.650 --> 29:52.471
It's the polygrapher's job
to figure out what they mean.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.397
So, while the machine
may be objective,

29:54.440 --> 29:56.340
the polygrapher's not.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.618
He's the key.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.833
So what do you want me to do,
flirt with him?

30:00.880 --> 30:02.268
I want you to throw him
off his game.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.446
Start by asking
a bunch of questions.

30:03.490 --> 30:04.536
KRISTEN:
And then what?

30:04.580 --> 30:07.231
Confess before the test starts.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.406
KRISTEN:
About my rsum?

30:08.450 --> 30:09.849
JASON:
No, about everything else.

30:09.890 --> 30:11.198
Every mistake
you've ever made,

30:11.240 --> 30:12.491
every lie
you've ever told.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.417
Convince him
that you are

30:14.460 --> 30:17.418
unburdening yourself,
being truthful.

30:17.460 --> 30:19.849
It'll make him want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.982
And, remember,
doubt is your friend.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.419
You don't have to come up
as truthful.

30:24.470 --> 30:27.906
Inconclusive works for you here.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.418
All right.
Are you ready?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.777
This is... I'm...

30:31.830 --> 30:33.343
I'm so honored
you'd bring me back

30:33.390 --> 30:34.869
for a second
InterVIew.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.433
Monica, actually,

30:36.480 --> 30:38.471
I'm afraid_ this isn't
a second InterVIew.

30:38.530 --> 30:40.998
Uh, the firm won't be able
to extend you an offer.

30:41.050 --> 30:42.745
What?

30:42.790 --> 30:45.486
Associate hiring is extremely

30:45.530 --> 30:47.578
competitive,
as you know.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.838
We've seen dozens

30:49.890 --> 30:53.530
of eminently qualified
candidates and, uh...

30:53.590 --> 30:55.888
well, I'm afraid
you came up short.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.410
[indistinct conversation]

30:59.460 --> 31:00.677
We're happy to have you.

31:02.550 --> 31:04.245
Most firms would have
sent a form letter.

31:04.290 --> 31:05.894
Why drag me in here?

31:05.950 --> 31:08.418
Because I...

31:08.470 --> 31:09.687
I want you to know

31:09.730 --> 31:11.254
I think you're
a stellar young woman,

31:11.300 --> 31:13.860
one with a very
promising future.

31:13.910 --> 31:17.698
And if I can be of any help,
please call.

31:17.740 --> 31:19.913
You brought me in here

31:19.960 --> 31:22.599
to say you want to help me...

31:22.660 --> 31:24.309
but not to give
me a job?

31:24.360 --> 31:26.612
Okay. Thanks.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.878
This was most illuminating.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.019
What is this place?

31:41.070 --> 31:43.504
It's a neutral,
third-party location.

31:43.550 --> 31:44.676
They said the polygrapher
would meet us here.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.062
FEMALE VOICE:
Hello.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.849
I'll be administering
your test today.

31:49.550 --> 31:51.029
I'll be asking you questions,

31:51.080 --> 31:52.468
then observing you
for truthfulness.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.289
Is this a joke?

31:57.350 --> 31:59.511
I analyze 50 different
measurements in real time,

31:59.560 --> 32:01.380
including basal
body temperature,

32:01.440 --> 32:04.819
retinal movement,
and vocal stress.

32:04.870 --> 32:06.565
I'm Multiple Input
Lie Detection.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.520
MILD, for short.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.942
Hello?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.991
DELLINGER:
Hey, It's Mr. GutIerrez.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.905
Did things work out
for your client?

32:43.960 --> 32:45.382
Actually, no.

32:45.440 --> 32:46.475
They've gotten worse,
Mr. Gutierrez.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.693
Wait. Is it my fault?

32:48.740 --> 32:52.005
No. My client submitted
for another polygraph,

32:52.050 --> 32:54.701
but it turned out to be one of
those new high-tech machines.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.001
MILD?

32:56.060 --> 32:58.358
You're familiar with it.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.219
Yeah, those Homeland Security
pinheads always think

33:00.280 --> 33:01.838
systems like that
are cutting-edge.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.585
AVATAR, Sberbank.

33:03.630 --> 33:06.451
You wouldn't happen to know
any way we could...

33:06.500 --> 33:07.546
beat it?

33:07.590 --> 33:09.148
DELLINGER:
Uh, sorry, no.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.451
ButI mean, it can't
be too difficult.

33:10.510 --> 33:11.841
It's a bucket of bolts.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.549
ALICIA:
We'd love to get some insight.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.898
DELLINGER: Uh, let me see
what I can pull together.

33:17.510 --> 33:19.501
Welcome back,
Mrs. Florrick.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.551
The water's fine.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.068
[indistinct chatter]

33:33.090 --> 33:36.173
GRACE: Actually, Mom,
that was my witness.

33:36.230 --> 33:37.834
ALICIA: What, why?
Grace, what's going on?

33:37.880 --> 33:39.006
DINOVERA:
She sounds stressed.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.095
That was not stress.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.129
Why is she at home?

33:41.190 --> 33:42.225
It's middle
of a workday.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.759
Maybe her firm tanked.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.619
That's distressing.

33:44.670 --> 33:46.228
If she were stressed,

33:46.280 --> 33:47.975
it would be because
she Is not over

33:48.020 --> 33:49.408
what's-his-face being shot.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.496
Do you think we can
get authorization?

33:51.550 --> 33:53.586
To keep up the three-hop?Yeah.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.154
Maybe if we use this data.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.726
I just sent you a file.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.461
[bleating]

34:01.510 --> 34:03.114

No more goats!

34:03.170 --> 34:05.070
Wait for it, wait for it.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.381
[sighs]
How long?

34:06.430 --> 34:08.512
23 seconds.

Fainting goats.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.046
[both bleating]

34:16.090 --> 34:17.341
My God, it's like day school.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.436
Let's go, everyone,
status meeting.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.833
Uh-oh, firings.What do you mean?

34:21.880 --> 34:24.189
The changes in the Patriot Act.
They take place at the end

34:24.230 --> 34:26.221
of the month-- they're not
gonna need all of us anymore.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.668
Are you kidding me?!

34:27.710 --> 34:29.666
I just moved into
a new apartment.

34:29.710 --> 34:31.109
Maybe it'll be
the guys in software.

34:31.150 --> 34:32.276
They're always screwing off.

34:32.330 --> 34:34.195
MAN:
Okay.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.105
I know you're
all anxious to hear

34:36.160 --> 34:37.639
about the changes
around here.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.329
As you probably all know

34:39.380 --> 34:42.201
we can no longer collect
bulk telephone data.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.148
[all groaning]

34:43.210 --> 34:46.077
I know,
it's a bit of a shift.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.259
But we're taking this
as good news.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.905
Okay, here we go--
their good news is our bad.

34:50.950 --> 34:52.815
FISA will still grant us
three-hop targeting

34:52.870 --> 34:54.212
of our most important cases,

34:54.260 --> 34:56.125
so none of you are
going to lose your jobs.

34:56.180 --> 34:57.386
[all clamoring in relief]

34:57.440 --> 34:58.566
Excuse me?

34:58.610 --> 35:00.874
Yes, you heard me.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.229
The reforms in the Patriot Act
will force us

35:03.270 --> 35:05.135
to be more focused,
that's all.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.964
All of_ our tools
are stI|| In place.

35:07.010 --> 35:08.318
Of course, it will mean
more paperwork.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.749
[all groaning]

35:10.800 --> 35:12.279
Seriously,
I just saved your jobs,

35:12.320 --> 35:14.971
and now you're complaining
about paperwork.

35:15.020 --> 35:18.069
[indistinct chatter]

35:18.110 --> 35:19.930
Uh, Mr. Foyle?

35:19.980 --> 35:22.153
We've been
tracking Dellinger,

35:22.200 --> 35:25.158
and he called
Alicia Florrick.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.723
What was the subject?

35:26.770 --> 35:28.556
No threat,
just talk of a case.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.249
Her husband's
running for president.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.779
Yes, but we've
been tracking

35:31.820 --> 35:34.994
everyone else that
Dellinger called.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.519
Okay, do this.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.471
You can track her
for 48 hours.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.249
Find me a connection
between Mrs. Florrick

35:40.310 --> 35:43.347
and another brown-level target
and I get you a green light.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.083
Brown level, seriously?

35:45.140 --> 35:46.744
Take yes for an answer.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.746
Thank you, sir.

35:48.790 --> 35:50.576

black lawyers in here.

What are you--
uh, Nigerian or what?

36:12.560 --> 36:17.202
DAVID: Thanks for coming in,
but I think I should warn you

36:17.260 --> 36:19.034
that we have a sort
of Lockhart/Agos/ Lee type here

36:19.080 --> 36:21.128
and you're not really it.

36:21.170 --> 36:23.957
CARY: We've had some
African-Americans

36:24.000 --> 36:26.309
here before--
not In all pOSItIons--

36:26.350 --> 36:30.002
but we are open to all types
and all backgrounds.

36:30.050 --> 36:33.178
No, no, you're exactly
the kind of diversity we want

36:33.230 --> 36:35.186
at Lockhart/Agos/ Lee.

36:35.230 --> 36:37.664
We've seen dozens of eminently
qualified candidates,

36:37.710 --> 36:40.235
and, um, well...

36:40.280 --> 36:42.794
you just came up short.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.580
Cary!

36:48.640 --> 36:49.846
[line ringing]

36:49.900 --> 36:51.982
ALICIA: Hello?Hey, it's Lucca.

36:52.030 --> 36:54.248
I got some good news on Jason.Really?

36:54.290 --> 36:56.338
Yeah, I spoke to a guy
that witnessed the fight

36:56.380 --> 36:58.245
with the judge.Uh, what'd he say?

36:58.300 --> 36:59.904
He _said there was some
pushIng and some shovmg,

36:59.950 --> 37:01.508
some raised voices,
but he said

37:01.560 --> 37:03.733
the judge walked
out of Callahan,

37:03.780 --> 37:06.123
this bar near the courthouse,
without a scrape on him.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.250
Judge Hess drew
a very different picture.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.084
You spoke with the judge?Yes.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.391
He made it sound like

37:11.440 --> 37:13.396
Jason beat him
within an inch of his life.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.873
[knocking]

37:14.920 --> 37:16.137
That's probably Kristen.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.612
I have to get down
to Springfield.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.183
How close are you?I'l| be less than five.

37:19.230 --> 37:20.356
Okay.

37:20.410 --> 37:22.059
[phone beeps]

37:22.100 --> 37:23.658
What?We can't be on the steps.

37:23.710 --> 37:25.052
The fire department says
they need reinforcement,

37:25.110 --> 37:26.589
and we don't have it.

37:26.630 --> 37:28.109
Let me get this straight.

37:28.150 --> 37:30.106
We couldn't announce
on the SprIngerld steps,

37:30.160 --> 37:31.889
because they're having
a square dancing contest.

37:31.940 --> 37:33.635
Break dancing
competition.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.069
Interfaith break dancing
competition.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.248
So we move to the steps of a
gym because they look similar.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.029
But now the fire department
says we can't announce there,

37:41.080 --> 37:42.593
because they'll collapse?!

37:42.650 --> 37:44.606
Or lean aggressively.So, where does that leave us?

37:44.650 --> 37:47.039
Inside of the gym?
Yes.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.899
Did Lincoln do anything here?No, sir.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.954
Did Obama do anything here?Not to our knowledge, sir.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.433
Would you mind putting
this on, sir?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.084
Why?

37:56.140 --> 37:57.835
It matches Obama's.

37:57.880 --> 37:58.960
Yes, because he announced

37:59.010 --> 38:01.183
outside in 12-degree weather.

38:01.230 --> 38:02.743
I'm announcing
in an 89—degree gym.

38:02.800 --> 38:06.019
Yes, but it won't
look that way on TV.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.108
No, but I'll be
sweating like a hog.

38:08.150 --> 38:10.015
We'll put some fans up
there to cool you down.

38:10.070 --> 38:13.107
And here's your scarf.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.151
Oh, Mr. Landau, hello.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.326
Ruth.
Frank.

38:16.380 --> 38:18.063
So glad you could
do this for us.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.803
Well, I'm honored
to be a part of it.

38:19.860 --> 38:21.987
Just sorry we couldn't
get the Obama location

38:22.030 --> 38:23.292
in the Old Capitol building.As am I.

38:23.340 --> 38:26.594
But, uh, here we have
the common touch.

38:26.650 --> 38:28.333
Yes, and the common smell.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.732
I think that's gym socks.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.338
[both laughing]

38:31.390 --> 38:33.563
REPORTER: In a few hours,
Peter Florrick is expected

38:33.610 --> 38:35.339
to take the stage
here in Springﬁeld

38:35.400 --> 38:38.346
to announce his candidacy
for president.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.617
So, are you gonna destroy him?

38:39.660 --> 38:41.787
Why don't you close the door?

38:41.840 --> 38:43.182
[door closes]

38:43.230 --> 38:44.743
So...

38:44.800 --> 38:47.189
are you going
to destroy him, Krishna?

38:47.230 --> 38:49.095
If I destroy Peter,
I destroy her.

38:49.150 --> 38:51.232
Ruth?No, Alicia.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.589
She doesn't know Peter
had her voting machines hacked.

38:53.630 --> 38:56.190
But he did it for her.Yeah, but then he
hung her out to dry.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.504
Then what's your plan?

38:58.550 --> 39:00.859
MAN [on TV]: ...jobs and most
importantly national security...

39:00.900 --> 39:02.242
I have no idea.

39:02.290 --> 39:03.279
REPORTER:
You're absolutely right.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.375
All that and more
comIng up next.

39:10.260 --> 39:13.036
I commend your ingenuity
and your chutzpah.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.867
Maybe if I'd put that in
the special skills section

39:15.910 --> 39:17.468
of my rsum,
I'd have a job.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.648
Monica, I'm not saying
our world today is enlightened.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.089
Far from it.

39:23.140 --> 39:26.871
But starting out as a woman
in a big law firm 30 years ago,

39:26.920 --> 39:30.481
let's just say I empathize.

39:30.540 --> 39:33.054
Everyone has to eat dirt
on the way up.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.749
The only difference
is the kind...

39:34.800 --> 39:36.529
Are you seriously
comparing histories?

39:36.590 --> 39:38.490
Yes, I am.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.757
If you chose to lay
on your back

39:40.810 --> 39:43.062
for a male partner or two,

39:43.110 --> 39:44.930
just to get ahead,
that was your choice.

39:44.990 --> 39:46.890
Excuse me?

39:46.940 --> 39:50.068
I don't choose to have women
hold theIr purses tIghter,

39:50.120 --> 39:52.429
when they see me
coming down the street.

39:52.470 --> 39:56.349
I don't choose for cops to drag
me out of my car and frisk me

39:56.390 --> 39:57.778
just for failing to signal.

39:57.830 --> 39:58.956
I'm not trying to equate...

39:59.000 --> 40:00.388
Yes, you are.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.307
And there is no comparison.

40:03.350 --> 40:06.740
I don't want your understanding.

40:06.790 --> 40:10.226
I don't need your advice.

40:10.270 --> 40:13.137
What I need is a job.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.961
It was from Springfield

40:17.020 --> 40:20.490
that Abraham Lincoln announced
his candidacy for president.

40:20.540 --> 40:22.883
It was from Springfield
that Barack Obama

40:22.940 --> 40:25.898
announced his candidacy
for president.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.114
And it is from Springfield
where our next great president

40:29.160 --> 40:31.720
will hail as well![crowd cheering]

40:31.770 --> 40:33.556
He understands
the challenges...

40:33.600 --> 40:35.113
Oh, my God,
I'm burning up.

40:35.170 --> 40:38.162
I'm like a wet
seal with sweat.

40:38.210 --> 40:39.939
Hold on.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.468
NORA:
Oh, that's so sweet.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.569
Yeah, you can't buy
moments like that.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.089
NORA:
Why are you so cynical?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.175
REPORTER:
And you may remember this photo

40:48.220 --> 40:49.869
of the president and First Lady

40:49.920 --> 40:51.478
on the day of his announcement.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.088
It's fun.

40:53.140 --> 40:56.098

41:13.990 --> 41:15.150
Well done, Frank.
Go on.

41:15.210 --> 41:16.632
Thank you, Frank!

41:18.650 --> 41:21.164
Well, I'm gonna make this brief.

41:21.210 --> 41:24.122
Today I'm announcing
my candidacy

41:24.170 --> 41:26.252
for the Democratic nomination

41:26.300 --> 41:30.179
for the President
of the United States of America!

41:30.220 --> 41:34.429
How's that for plain speaking?

41:34.490 --> 41:35.878
Well, let me just tell you
I couldn't do it

41:35.920 --> 41:38.138
without this woman by my side.

41:38.190 --> 41:40.226
[applause]WOMAN: Alicia!

41:40.280 --> 41:41.531
Oh, cool air.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.445
Thank you.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.309
I think you all know
my wonderful wife.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.053

Hello?

41:52.070 --> 41:54.288
Oh, Mrs. Florrick,
how are you?

41:54.330 --> 41:55.638
You must be in Springfield.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.931
Yes, sorry it's so loud.

41:56.990 --> 41:58.287
Oh, I hear it's going well.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.207
I'm really happy for
you and your husband.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.330
Yes, uh, there are
a dozen supporters

42:02.380 --> 42:03.597
staring at me right now.

42:03.650 --> 42:05.163
Good for you.

42:05.210 --> 42:06.814
Yes, I'm gonna tell them
about Spoiler.

42:06.870 --> 42:09.259
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, what?

42:09.300 --> 42:10.904
Jeff Dellinger
is willing to talk.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.382
So is Kristen.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.169
Well, that's exciting.

42:14.220 --> 42:15.528
What do you think
will happen to Running Milk

42:17.400 --> 42:18.742
they're in bed with the NSA?

42:18.790 --> 42:22.089
Okay, just-just
wait, h-hold on.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.311
Amend the suit.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.748
What?

42:24.800 --> 42:27.234
Have Kristen s_ue _
for gender dIscrImInatIon

42:27.280 --> 42:28.360
and we'll settle.

42:28.410 --> 42:29.718
They'd rather be seen as sexist

42:29.760 --> 42:31.364
than in bed with
the next Edward Snowden?

42:31.410 --> 42:32.581
ANDREA:
Of course they would, Alicia.

42:32.630 --> 42:34.712
Don't be naive.
$1.2 million.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.025
Take it to your client and
we'll have a nice little chat.

42:38.070 --> 42:39.594
She just said Snowden.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.720
What?
Alicia Florrick.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.374
She just said Snowden.

42:42.420 --> 42:43.819
The next Snowden.What was the context?

42:43.860 --> 42:45.771
It doesn't matter the context.
She said it.

42:45.820 --> 42:47.378
He's a brown target.

42:47.430 --> 42:48.943
That's our second connection.

42:50.650 --> 42:52.515

We just found
our back...

Dude, what is this?

42:56.740 --> 42:58.389
