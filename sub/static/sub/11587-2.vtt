male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.441 --> 00:11.112
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.514
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.514 --> 00:15.416
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.416 --> 00:17.118
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.118 --> 00:19.120
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.323
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.258
- 16 MURDERS
OVER FOURTH OF JULY.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.260
- THEY CUT BACK
ON THE STOP-AND-SEARCHES,

00:26.260 --> 00:27.628
PEOPLE START CARRYING.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.297
- WELL, I'M SURE IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO

00:29.297 --> 00:32.833
WITH 20 DAYS IN A ROW
OVER 90 DEGREES.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.169
- OKAY, FOLKS, LISTEN UP.
[clears throat]

00:35.169 --> 00:36.804
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STUCK TOGETHER
A LITTLE LONGER.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.107
- WHAT? THE CAPTAIN
WAS CLEARED A MONTH AGO.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.374
- OF CRIMINAL CHARGES.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.443
1 PP STILL HASN'T
DECLARED HIM FIT FOR DUTY.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.313
- 1 PP.
WELCOME TO THE PUZZLE PALACE.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.747
- BUT THEY DID SAY
THAT HE WAS COMING BACK.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.349
- FAR AS I KNOW.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.384
MEANTIME, I'VE BEEN
THINKING SOME THINGS OVER.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.387
I'D LIKE TO MOVE SOME PIECES
AROUND ON THE BOARD.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.389
- YOU CAN MOVE ME
BACK TO FRANCE.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.790
- ACTUALLY, I'M JUST
TEAMING YOU UP BACK UP

00:56.790 --> 00:58.459
WITH YOUR OLD PARTNER.
- REALLY?

00:58.459 --> 00:59.860
- CAPTAIN, FIN AND I HAVE
BEEN KIND OF--

00:59.860 --> 01:01.762
- GETTING TO THAT.
I'D LIKE TO...

01:01.762 --> 01:03.464
PAIR YOU UP WITH BENSON.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.798
I SENSE YOU'LL WORK
WELL TOGETHER.

01:04.798 --> 01:05.833
SOUND GOOD?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.568
- MAZEL TOV.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.570
YOU GOT TWO COUPLES
ON THE FLOOR.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.573
WHAT ABOUT SERPICO'S
DANCE CARD?

01:12.573 --> 01:13.574
- SWING MAN.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.244
SOMETIMES ON HIS OWN,
DEPENDING ON THE CALL.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.811
THAT ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, NICK?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.580
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.782
- OKAY THEN.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.457
- NICK...
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

01:29.457 --> 01:32.326
I DIDN'T ASK HARRIS
TO MAKE THAT SWITCH.

01:32.326 --> 01:36.330
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.
I DID.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.332
- YOU DID?

01:38.332 --> 01:41.869
- LIV...IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.404
ONE THING ABOUT YOU...

01:43.404 --> 01:45.273
YOU NEED TO HAVE
A PARTNER YOU CAN TRUST.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.781
- THERE IS NO THERE THERE.
- I TRUST HIM MORE

01:53.781 --> 01:56.650
THAN SOME GUY WHO CLAIMS
HE WAS BORN IN HAWAII,

01:56.650 --> 01:59.253
GREW UP IN INDONESIA,
WENT TO A MADRASAH--

01:59.253 --> 02:01.189
- OOH, A MADRASAH.
WELL, THAT'S SCARY.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.390
THAT'S NOT LIKE
AN OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN, IS IT?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.492
[knock at door]
- PUNCHING OUT, BOSS.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.594
YOU AN ADAM CAIN FAN?

02:06.594 --> 02:09.797
- NO, IT'S JUST WHITE NOISE
FOR THE PAPERWORK.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.232
- MM-HMM.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.700
- SO HOW'D MY NEW LINEUP
GO OVER TODAY?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.235
- LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.803
THEY'LL ADJUST.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.438
HEAVY LIES THE CROWN.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.273
- THANKS.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.275
TAKE THE REST
OF THE NIGHT OFF.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.278
- [laughs]
OKAY.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.413
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RAISING CAIN.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.248
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.416
I'D LIKE TO RAISE
A LITTLE CAIN WITH YOU.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.284
LISA,
THANKS FOR YOUR USUAL

02:30.284 --> 02:32.720
COMPASSIONATE,
ANTEBELLUM ANALYSIS.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.323
FOLKS, FOUR MORE MONTHS
OF THIS TORTURE

02:35.323 --> 02:36.757
UNTIL THE ELECTION.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.392
AND SPEAKING OF TORTURE,

02:38.392 --> 02:41.362
IS YOUR LOCAL SEX SHOP
SOLD OUT OF WHIPS AND HANDCUFFS?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.896
WELL, YOU CAN BLAME IT
ON OUR NEXT GUEST.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.865
HER RUNAWAY BESTSELLER
TWENTY-FIVE ACTS

02:44.865 --> 02:47.735
FOLLOWS A WOMAN'S JOURNEY
INTO A WORLD OF DOMINATION,

02:47.735 --> 02:51.239
AND IT'S REVOLUTIONIZING
WOMEN'S ATTITUDES TOWARD SEX.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.641
I'M JUST GLAD
THEY WANT IT ALL.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.677
NOW HER BOOK MAKES FIFTY SHADES
LOOK LIKE A DISNEY STORY.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.414
SHE IS HOT, RICH, KINKY.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.216
I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.352
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
JOCELYN PALEY.

03:04.352 --> 03:09.223
[applause]

03:09.223 --> 03:11.392
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD
KISS YOU OR SPANK YOU.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.294
- WHO SAYS
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.329
[laughter]
- PLEASE.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.365
YOU DID GREAT.
THE AUDIENCE LOVED YOU.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.733
- ONLY BECAUSE
I HAD A GOOD PARTNER.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.405
SO...

03:24.405 --> 03:27.408
ADAM...

03:27.408 --> 03:29.843
WHAT'S YOUR FANTASY?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.990
[both chuckling]

03:48.262 --> 03:50.331
[buttons clattering on floor]

03:52.032 --> 03:55.369
- ACT TWO.
I SAY WHEN YOU CAN TOUCH ME.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.338
- WELL, I'M SORRY, SIR.
- TURN AROUND.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.574
GET ON THE BED.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.311
NO, NO, ON ALL FOURS.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.384
YOU NEED TO BE PUNISHED.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.452
[thwack]
- AH!

04:11.452 --> 04:13.787
THAT REALLY HURT.
S-STOP IT--

04:13.787 --> 04:16.290
[gags]
STO--

04:16.290 --> 04:17.525
[strained]
STOP!

04:17.525 --> 04:20.861
- YOU DON'T TELL ME...
WHAT TO DO.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.397
- [gasping]

05:13.681 --> 05:15.383
- SARA PALERMO,
JOCELYN'S BOOK TOUR ESCORT.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.850
- RIGHT.
YOU CALLED 911.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.453
- I WENT TO HER HOTEL
TO TAKE HER TO A RADIO SHOW.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.555
SHE WAS CRYING--THERE WAS BLOOD
ON HER NIGHTGOWN.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.023
- OKAY, DID SHE
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.858
- SHE KEEPS SAYING
NOTHING HAPPENED,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.760
BUT SHE HAS BRUISES
AND A MARK ON HER NECK.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.696
- OKAY, AND WHEN'S
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HER

05:28.696 --> 05:30.698
BEFORE ALL OF THAT?
- SHE HAD A TAPING YESTERDAY.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.666
ADAM CAIN.
- THE TALK SHOW HOST.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.702
- HE ASKED HER OUT AFTER.
SHE WAS SKY HIGH.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.771
TODAY NOT A WORD.
WHAT'S THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.139
- I WASN'T RAPED.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.675
I DIDN'T ASK HER
TO CALL THE POLICE.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.477
- OKAY, BUT THERE'S...
PAPERWORK.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.547
CAN YOU JUST CONFIRM THAT YOU
WERE ON A DATE WITH MR. CAIN?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.682
- JUST FOR DRINKS,
THEN HIS PLACE.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.418
- THAT BRUISE ON YOUR NECK.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.719
THAT FROM HIM?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.421
- HE GOT A LITTLE HANDSY.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.390
- BECAUSE IT REALLY LOOKS
MORE LIKE A BELT DID IT.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.426
- DID YOU ASK HIM
TO DO THAT TO YOU?

05:58.426 --> 06:01.629
- NO, BUT I THINK HE THOUGHT
IT WAS PART OF THE SEX.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.632
- SO YOU DID HAVE SEX.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.567
- [stammering]
HE--HE...

06:06.567 --> 06:09.737
PUT IT INSIDE ME,
BUT NOT WHERE I WAS USED TO.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.607
- DID YOU TELL HIM TO STOP?

06:13.607 --> 06:14.575
- I TRIED.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.977
HE PULLED THE BELT SO TIGHT,
I COULDN'T TALK.

06:16.977 --> 06:21.048
I-I HAD BEEN FLIRTING
WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.551
I TOLD HIM I WANTED HIM
TO DOMINATE ME.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.986
I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN
CALL THAT RAPE.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.055
- OKAY, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
TO DECIDE THAT RIGHT NOW.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.824
BUT IN THE MEANTIME...
YOU SHOULD DO A RAPE KIT.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.560
JUST IN CASE.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.594
- I WON'T NEED IT.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.697
- DID HE USE A CONDOM?

06:36.697 --> 06:39.800
HONEY, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO GET TESTED FOR STDs.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.205
- SCARING SOMEONE
INTO GETTING A RAPE KIT?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.708
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO BUILD TRUST.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.976
- IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER
EITHER WAY.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.744
HAVE YOU READ HER BOOK?
- NO.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.646
- MY SISTER GAVE IT TO ME,
RIGHT?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.648
IN ACT FIVE,
THE MAIN CHARACTER

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
IS CHOKED WITH A BELT
AND SODOMIZED.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.686
SHE HAS, LIKE, 18 ORGASMS.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.888
- GREAT.
THAT'S A BEST-SELLER.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.556
- AND FOR YOU PERSONALLY,

07:02.556 --> 07:03.991
HOW ARE YOU DEALING
WITH ALL THIS ATTENTION?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.594
- MY LIFE FEELS
A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.761
- SOME DISCIPLINE MIGHT HELP.
OR HURT.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
- IDEALLY, BOTH.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.465
- WELL, STAY WITH US,
AMERICA.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.833
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
AFTER THIS BREAK.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.602
[applause]
OR MAYBE WE WON'T.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.069
- SHE'S GIVING
AS GOOD AS SHE GETS HERE.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.606
- BUT IT TURNED UGLY
WHEN THEY WERE ALONE.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.208
- SHE'S NOT CLAIMING RAPE,
BUT SHE AGREED TO A RAPE KIT?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.711
- WELL, RELUCTANTLY.
SHE HAS ANAL FISSURES

07:23.711 --> 07:25.746
AND A SEVERE LIGATURE MARK
ON HER NECK.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.080
- SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.582
- NO, SHE'S WORRIED,
YOU KNOW,

07:28.582 --> 07:30.884
BECAUSE OF HER BOOK.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.920
- HER PROSE IS PRETTY FLORID,
ALTHOUGH I ADMIRE ANY AUTHOR

07:32.920 --> 07:36.256
WHO CAN WORK IN NIPPLE CLAMPS
AND ALBINONI'S ADAGIO

07:36.256 --> 07:38.158
IN ONE SENTENCE.
- YOU READ THIS?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.093
- THE YENTAS AT MY MOTHER'S
RETIREMENT HOME

07:40.093 --> 07:42.663
WERE PASSING IT AROUND AND
MY MOTHER'S LOSING HER SIGHT,

07:42.663 --> 07:44.932
SO I READ IT TO HER.
- OKAY, THIS ISN'T A BOOK CLUB.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.701
IF SHE'S NOT PRESSING CHARGES,
WHY ARE WE WASTING OUR TIME?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.674
- CAPTAIN,
YOU'RE NEW TO SVU.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.578
VICTIMS SOMETIMES TAKE TIME
TO PROCESS.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.747
SHE SAID STOP.
HE TIGHTENED THE BELT.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.849
HE PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT,
GIVEN HER BOOK,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.150
THAT HE COULD GET AWAY
WITH IT.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.786
- AND THERE ARE RUMORS
ABOUT THIS GUY.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.154
I MEAN, HE'S FORWARD
WITH HIS FEMALE GUESTS,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.722
ESPECIALLY THE HOT ONES,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:08.722 --> 08:10.558
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT HE CROSSED THE LINE

08:10.558 --> 08:12.593
WITH A FEW OF HIS INTERNS.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.894
- HOLD ON.
CAIN MAY BE A LADIES' MAN,

08:13.894 --> 08:15.563
BUT HE IS ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.997
- WE'VE SEEN HIM AT BENEFITS.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.599
POLICE WIDOWS, BATTERED WOMEN.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.700
HE NEVER SAYS NO.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.235
- YOU MEAN HE NEVER HEARS NO.
- OKAY.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.738
FIN AND MUNCH,
PAY CAIN A FRIENDLY VISIT

08:24.738 --> 08:27.140
BEFORE CHARGES,
BEFORE HE LAWYERS UP.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.810
BENSON, ROLLINS,
CHECK AND SEE

08:29.810 --> 08:31.879
IF JOCELYN'S
HAD TIME TO PROCESS.

08:31.879 --> 08:36.684
- AND I'M WHAT...
READING THE BOOK?

08:36.684 --> 08:37.851
- AND YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW UP
ON THE RUMORS

08:37.851 --> 08:39.753
ABOUT CAIN AND HIS INTERNS.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.823
IF HE DID DO WHAT SHE SAYS,
HE'S DONE IT BEFORE.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.593
YOU, UH, BRINGING ROLLINS
UP TO SPEED?

08:45.593 --> 08:46.727
- UP TO SPEED?
- MM-HMM.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.061
- SHE'S BEEN HERE A YEAR.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.997
SHE HAS A DEGREE
IN FORENSIC SCIENCE.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.734
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT SHY
ABOUT SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.637
SHARE IT WITH HER, NOT ME.
OKAY?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.941
- I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S A JOKE,

09:00.941 --> 09:02.776
BUT IT'S NOT.
IT'S JOKE-LIKE.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.344
PLEASE MAKE ME FUNNY.
PLEASE.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.113
- ADAM CAIN.
- YEAH, HEY!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.781
DETECTIVE MUNCH, RIGHT?
YEAH.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.717
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME.
I'M A BLEEDER.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.752
- YOU REMEMBER MY PARTNER FIN?
HE'S A BIG FAN.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.054
- WHAT IS IT,
IS IT THE WIDOW'S FUND AGAIN?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.656
WHAT CAN I DO?
DO YOU NEED SOME TICKETS

09:15.656 --> 09:17.591
OR SOME BACKSTAGE TOURS?
WHAT?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.159
- NO, WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT JOCELYN PALEY.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.360
SHE WAS A GUEST
ON YOUR SHOW LAST NIGHT.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.729
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY?

09:21.729 --> 09:23.797
- YOU TWO WENT OUT
TO DINNER AFTER?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.232
- COME ON, GUYS.
DON'T SANDBAG ME.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.100
IS JOSS OKAY?
SOMETHING HAPPEN?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.335
- SHE MAY HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.237
- OH, MY GOD.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.741
I PUT HER IN A CAR SERVICE
LAST NIGHT AT 1:00.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.309
SHE SEEMED FINE.
JUST A LITTLE TIPSY, BUT...

09:36.309 --> 09:37.911
WAS IT THE DRIVER?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.747
- NOTHING ROUGH
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.249
- SERIOUSLY?
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.151
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
YOUR SIDE?

09:44.151 --> 09:46.787
- [laughs]
OH, JEEZ.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.158
YOU KNOW HER BOOK, RIGHT?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.060
WELL, WE ACTED OUT
A FEW SCENES.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.163
SHE WANTED ME TO THROW HER DOWN
AND...TAKE CONTROL.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.398
- WHOSE IDEA WAS THE BELT?

09:58.398 --> 10:01.735
- THAT?
THAT WAS HERS.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.203
- YOU SAID YOU
WERE IN CONTROL.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.273
- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US WAS CONSENSUAL.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.908
NOW, LOOK, I DON'T WANNA
KISS AND TELL,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.743
BUT SHE GAVE ME HER PANTIES
IN THE RESTAURANT.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.712
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.180
NOW I KNOW YOU GUYS
GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.848
I KNOW I DO.
I GOT A SHOW TO PREP.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.184
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.687
- THE GUY SEEM TESTY TO YOU?

10:19.687 --> 10:23.356
- NO CHARGES FILED,
AND I HATE THIS CASE ALREADY.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.762
- I HADN'T HAD AN ORGASM
SINCE I HAD MY THIRD KID,

10:28.762 --> 10:30.998
AND THEN I READ YOUR BOOK.
- FOUND YOUR INNER VENUS?

10:30.998 --> 10:33.400
- AND THEN SOME. HEY,
CAN YOU MAKE THAT OUT TO JACK?

10:33.400 --> 10:37.004
MY HUSBAND IS YOUR BIGGEST FAN.
- JOCELYN.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.672
- UH, I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.041
- WE WON'T TAKE UP MUCH TIME.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.180
- HOW YOU FEELING?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.349
- LONG DAY.
I'M FINE.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.451
- JOCELYN, YOU HAD
SOME PRETTY SERIOUS INJURIES.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.387
YOU MAY WANNA
TAKE IT EASY.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.723
- THEY GAVE ME TYLENOL
AND CODEINE.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.257
I'M A HAPPY CAMPER.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.759
- OKAY, FROM YOUR REACTION,

10:58.759 --> 11:01.361
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU MAY BE IN SHOCK.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.697
- I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A TEN-CITY BOOK TOUR.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.466
ANTHRACITE MAGAZINE
IS THROWING ME A PARTY TONIGHT.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.435
THE LAST THING I NEED TO DO
IS DEAL WITH THIS NOW.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.937
- OKAY, LISTEN, HONEY,

11:09.937 --> 11:11.404
LATER ON, IF YOU DO DECIDE
TO PRESS CHARGES,

11:11.404 --> 11:14.174
THIS BEHAVIOR IS GONNA
MAKE A JURY THINK TWICE.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.943
YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:15.943 --> 11:18.011
IT'S SCREWED UP,
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.347
- I'M A BIG GIRL.
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.817
- IF YOU NEED US...
WILL YOU CALL?

11:28.756 --> 11:31.391
- ALL RIGHT!
WHO'S NEXT?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.860
[woman murmurs]

11:32.860 --> 11:36.396
[background chatter]

11:36.396 --> 11:39.767
- YOU'VE CERTAINLY TURNED
THE PUBLISHING WORLD ON END.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.302
WHICH I GATHER IS A POSITION
YOU LIKE AS WELL.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.739
- A TOAST!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

11:45.739 --> 11:47.440
A TOAST
TO OUR GUEST OF HONOR.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.910
JOCELYN, THANK YOU

11:49.910 --> 11:52.512
FOR UNLEASHING THE INNER VENUS
WITHIN EVERY AMERICAN WOMAN.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.515
EVERY AMERICAN MAN IS DEEPLY,
AND I DO MEAN DEEPLY,

11:55.515 --> 11:57.484
GRATEFUL.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.753
HEAR, HEAR!

12:12.766 --> 12:14.101
[elevator bell dings]

12:24.311 --> 12:26.513
- [gasps]

12:28.315 --> 12:29.917
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU--

12:29.917 --> 12:33.286
- YOU TALKED TO THE COPS?
BITCH.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.327
YOU KNOW YOU WANTED IT.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.529
AND YOU KNOW THAT
YOU WANT THIS TOO.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.565
[zip]

12:45.565 --> 12:47.835
- [gasps]
AH!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.309
- JOCELYN.
- I'M SO SORRY.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.178
I JUST COULDN'T HANDLE
A POLICE STATION RIGHT NOW.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.181
- OH, PLEASE COME IN.
THAT'S WHY I GAVE YOU MY CARD.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.116
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.452
- HE SHOWED UP TO MY PARTY.
HE WASN'T ON THE LIST.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.054
HE--HE MADE A TOAST.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.589
- SLOW DOWN.
YOU MEAN "HE"--ADAM CAIN?

13:09.589 --> 13:11.358
- I JUST HAD TO LEAVE.
I WENT INTO AN ELEVATOR,

13:11.358 --> 13:12.860
AND HE FOLLOWED ME IN.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.361
HE WAS SO ANGRY.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.329
HE THOUGHT I TOLD THE POLICE
HE RAPED ME.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.498
DID YOU TELL HIM I SAID THAT?

13:18.498 --> 13:23.003
- WE DID SEND DETECTIVES
TO TALK TO HIM.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.138
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.439
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

13:26.439 --> 13:28.141
- I KNOW HOW UPSETTING THIS IS.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.210
WHY DON'T YOU COME
HAVE A SEAT, OKAY?

13:30.210 --> 13:34.314
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT HE DID, OKAY?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.017
SIT.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.419
- HE--HE PULLED UP MY SKIRT.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.155
[sniffles]

13:42.155 --> 13:44.557
GOD...

13:44.557 --> 13:46.994
HE DID IT AGAIN.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.162
- HE RAPED YOU?

13:51.231 --> 13:55.302
- HE--HE SAID I WANTED IT
LIKE I WANTED IT LAST NIGHT.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.005
- AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:58.005 --> 14:01.008
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I JUST FROZE.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.076
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.078
- WHEN THE ELEVATOR LANDED,

14:05.078 --> 14:09.282
HE SAID, "IF YOU SCREW WITH ME,
YOU'LL BE SORRY."

14:09.282 --> 14:13.353
- JOCELYN, ARE YOU READY
TO PRESS CHARGES NOW?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.163
- IT'S PRETTY BRAZEN.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.631
HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT
THERE WERE SECURITY CAMERAS.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.666
- HE ALSO PROBABLY KNOWS
IT'S ACT NINE OF THE BOOK--

14:26.666 --> 14:29.169
ELEVATOR SEX.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.938
I READ THE MASTERPIECE
LAST NIGHT.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.273
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S ENJOYING IT.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.275
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S RESISTING EITHER.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.344
- WELL, THAT'S CALLED
TONIC IMMOBILITY, FIN.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.246
- SHE WAS TRAUMATIZED
FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.613
HE GOES AFTER HER AGAIN.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.449
NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS
FIGHT OR FLIGHT.

14:42.449 --> 14:46.086
BUT THERE IS A THIRD RESPONSE,
AND THAT'S YOU FREEZE.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.620
- GOOD LUCK TRYING
TO SELL THAT TO A JURY.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.023
- NO, ROLLINS KNOWS HER STUFF.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.492
WOULDN'T HURT THE REST OF YOU
TO KEEP UP WITH THE LITERATURE.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.028
SO...JOCELYN READY
TO PRESS CHARGES?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.064
- WE'RE READY TO GO TO THE D.A.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.498
- WELL, WHICH ONE?

14:58.498 --> 15:02.135
THEY'VE ALL LAWYERED UP
SINCE DELIA WILSON NAMED NAMES.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.670
- I GOT SOMEBODY.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.305
RAFAEL BARBA.
- HE'S THE GUY

15:05.305 --> 15:06.439
THAT PUT AWAY THE TWO JOHNS

15:06.439 --> 15:08.208
FOR RAPING A PROSTITUTE.
- YEAH, THAT WAS A TOUGH CASE.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.144
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN BROOKLYN.
- HE WAS.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.080
JUST REQUESTED A LATERAL
TO MANHATTAN.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.582
GUY'S GOT BIG BRASS--

15:15.582 --> 15:17.117
EGO.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.518
ADAM CAIN'S HIGH-PROFILE.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.288
SO'S JOCELYN.
HE'S PERFECT.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.591
- COME ON, BARBA.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.960
THE VIC WAS DRUNK,
HER MEMORY SPOTTY.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.661
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.
- YOUR CLIENT--

15:28.661 --> 15:31.064
A JURY TAKES ONE LOOK
AT THE SIMIAN CARRIAGE,

15:31.064 --> 15:32.565
THE NEANDERTHAL JAW--
I'LL GET HIM CONVICTED

15:32.565 --> 15:34.968
FOR KIDNAPPING
THE LINDBERGH BABY.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.071
SO HOW ABOUT HE TAKES TEN AND
SPARES US ALL THE HUMILIATION?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.406
- CALL YOU IN THE MORNING.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.575
- CAPTAIN.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.444
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS
TO WORK DAY?

15:44.444 --> 15:48.315
- DETECTIVES BENSON AND ROLLINS,
RAFAEL BARBA.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.452
I LIED AND TOLD THEM YOU KNOW
YOUR WAY AROUND A COURTROOM.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.721
- THIS GIRL,
SHE APPEARS CREDIBLE?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.423
- SHE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT PERCEPTION,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.391
BUT SHE WAS RAPED TWICE.
- I DIDN'T ASK IF SHE WAS RAPED.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.493
I ASKED IF
SHE APPEARS CREDIBLE.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.295
- OKAY, I KNOW
YOU HAVE TO ASK THAT--

16:02.295 --> 16:04.464
- REASON BEING WE HAD A CASE
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, RED HOOK.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.033
GUY STRANGLED A GIRL SO HARD,

16:06.033 --> 16:07.267
HER EYES HAD
PETECHIAL HEMORRHAGING.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.202
PUNK TELLS THE JURY
THEY MET IN A BAR,

16:09.202 --> 16:10.470
SHE'S INTO S&M.
IT'S A COMPLETE LIE.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.472
THE JURY DEADLOCKS.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.608
LATER WE FIND OUT THAT HALF
OF THEM READ YOUR VICTIM'S BOOK.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.410
- OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.513
HARRIS TOLD US THAT YOU WIN
CASES THAT EVERYBODY ELSE DUCKS.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.017
- SOMETIMES.
LET ME TALK TO THE VICTIM.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.353
- SHE'S HAD
A ROUGH COUPLE OF DAYS.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.755
- IF WE GO FORWARD,
IT'S NOT GONNA GET ANY EASIER.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.658
DID YOU AND ADAM CAIN HAVE
ANY CONTACT BEFORE THE SHOW?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.626
- NO, THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.262
- AND AFTER THE SHOW,
HE ASKED YOU OUT?

16:35.262 --> 16:36.763
- YES. I'VE GONE OVER
ALL OF THIS.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.331
- YEAH, I'M SORRY, JOCELYN,
BUT THIS IS

16:38.331 --> 16:40.333
ALL PART OF THE PROCESS.
- I HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING

16:40.333 --> 16:41.634
ABOUT YOU--
NOT JUST YOU AND CAIN,

16:41.634 --> 16:44.171
BUT YOUR WHOLE PERSONAL HISTORY,
EVERYTHING.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.073
BECAUSE THE ONE THING
YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE OUT

16:46.073 --> 16:47.640
IS THE ONE THING
THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO USE

16:47.640 --> 16:49.576
TO BLOW UP THE CASE.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.212
YOU MAY NOT LIKE ME
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.513
- I DON'T LIKE YOU NOW.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.349
- HONESTY.
GOOD.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.585
LET'S START
WITH YOUR DATING LIFE.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.587
YOU CURRENTLY SEEING ANYONE?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.289
- NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.624
- BUT YOU ARE WRITING
A DATING ADVICE COLUMN.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.393
- THOSE WHO CAN'T DO, BLOG.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.728
- EVER ACCUSED
ANYONE ELSE OF RAPE?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.163
- NO.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.631
- HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN RAPED BEFORE?

17:11.631 --> 17:14.401
- I JUST SAID NO.
- THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.536
YOUR DATING LIFE IN COLLEGE--
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.371
- ADAM CAIN'S DEMEANOR--
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

17:18.371 --> 17:21.174
CHARMING AND COCKY.
- HE DIDN'T CHARM ME.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.642
- DID HE SEEM LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY

17:22.642 --> 17:24.111
WHO DIDN'T REALIZE
HE'D CROSSED THE LINE?

17:24.111 --> 17:25.678
- NO, HE KNEW.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

17:25.678 --> 17:27.580
BETWEEN HIM AND
A POWER ASSERTIVE RAPIST

17:27.580 --> 17:29.249
IS HE'S GOT
A BETTER VOCABULARY.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.250
- I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T MEET HIM.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.186
- I DID SOME DIGGING.
THERE'S A LOT OF RUMORS.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.488
HE PREYS ON YOUNG GIRLS
NEW TO THE CITY.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.225
- ANY OF THEM PRESS CHARGES?
- JOCELYN WILL BE THE FIRST.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.127
- OKAY. THERE'S NO RUSH.
POWERFUL GUY.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.195
WE GO UP AGAINST HIM,
WE MOVE DELIBERATELY.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.796
- MAYBE WE DO, HE DOESN'T.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.266
HE DECIDED HE WAS GONNA LEAK
HIS OPENING MONOLOGUE

17:46.266 --> 17:50.437
FOR TONIGHT'S BROADCAST,
AND IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.439
- YOU HEAR THESE STORIES--

17:52.439 --> 17:55.442
POWERFUL MEN BEING ACCUSED
OF DOING SOMETHING STUPID.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.311
WELL, NOW I'M
ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.414
THE MEDIA
HE SAID, SHE SAID CIRCUS

18:01.414 --> 18:03.250
IS COMING TO TOWN,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.652
AND I AM ABOUT TO BE THROWN
INTO THE RING OF FIRE.

18:05.652 --> 18:09.122
I'M ABOUT TO BE ACCUSED
OF RAPE

18:09.122 --> 18:11.324
BY AUTHOR JOCELYN PALEY.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.560
NOW, BEFORE I'M CHARGED,

18:13.560 --> 18:17.464
I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE THING
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.367
UNLIKE A CERTAIN
FORMER PRESIDENT...

18:20.367 --> 18:24.271
I DID HAVE SEX
WITH THAT WOMAN.

18:24.271 --> 18:28.141
NOW, I KNOW IT,
AND SHE DAMN WELL KNOWS IT TOO.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.544
- SMART MOVE.
GOT IN FRONT OF IT.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.713
- RIGHT OUT OF
LETTERMAN'S PLAYBOOK.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.183
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
LETTERMAN DIDN'T RAPE ANYONE.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.584
- JUST LET HIM
KEEP RUNNING HIS MOUTH.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.786
LIKE THE COUNSELOR SAYS,
WE'LL TAKE OUR TIME,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.388
BUT WE'LL GET HIM.
- AND IN THE MEANTIME?

18:41.388 --> 18:44.324
HE CAN JUST USE HIS SHOW
AS A BULLY PULPIT?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.259
- CAIN JUST FORCED OUR HAND.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.396
WE HAVE TO STRIKE BACK.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.699
- CITIZEN CANE,
READY FOR YOUR CLOSE UP?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.401
LET'S GO.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.369
- LOOK, WE DON'T NEED
TO DO THIS HERE, FELLAS.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.172
I CAN COME IN TOMORROW
WITH MY LAWYER.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.673
- COME ON, STAND UP,
EMMY BOY.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.411
IF YOU WANTED PRIVACY,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MOUTHED OFF.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.578
[reporters shouting]
- AH!

19:05.578 --> 19:07.347
- GET YOUR HEAD UP, CAIN.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.615
I'VE DONE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.817
THIS IS A JOKE!
NYPD GOT SO JAMMED UP

19:10.817 --> 19:12.619
WITH THEIR HOOKER SCANDAL,

19:12.619 --> 19:14.487
THEY'LL DO ANYTHING
THEY CAN TO DISTRACT FROM IT.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.389
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO SHUT UP!

19:16.389 --> 19:18.391
- COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, BABY.
IT'S MY WHEELHOUSE.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.827
- TAKING DOWN RAPISTS--
THAT'S OURS.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.398
- WE REQUEST REMAND.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.466
THE DEFENDANT HAS
THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO FLEE,

19:26.466 --> 19:27.567
AND HE'S A CANADIAN CITIZEN

19:27.567 --> 19:28.935
WITH STRONG FAMILY TIES
IN VANCOUVER.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.437
- MY CLIENT HAS STATED PUBLICLY

19:30.437 --> 19:31.771
THAT HE IS READY
TO SHOW UP AT TRIAL

19:31.771 --> 19:33.573
AND FIGHT
THESE FALSE ALLEGATIONS.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.775
- THAT PUBLIC STATEMENT WAS A
TELEVISED ATTACK ON THE VICTIM.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.578
- FROM HIS PEABODY AWARD-WINNING
POLITICAL PROGRAM.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.448
THIS IS THE STATE'S ATTEMPT
TO CONTROL PUBLIC OUTRAGE.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.583
- THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS
CONTROL IS CAIN'S BEHAVIOR.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.618
HE'S ATTACKED JOCELYN PALEY
TWICE IN TWO NIGHTS.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.554
- SAVE IT FOR THE TRIAL,
COUNSELORS.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.588
I'M GRANTING REMAND.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.623
[taps gavel]

19:53.460 --> 19:54.694
- SO NOW YOU'RE AGAINST
FREE SPEECH?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.563
- HOW ABOUT CAIN OPENS
HIS MOUTH AGAIN,

19:56.563 --> 19:57.997
I'LL MOVE FOR A GAG ORDER?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.667
- FROM WHAT I READ,
YOUR WITNESS LIKES THOSE TOO.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.435
- SHE'S A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.736
- IT WAS GREAT
WHEN SHE WAS ON OUR SIDE.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.572
THAT? THAT WAS JUST
A WARNING SHOT.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.540
SHE'S GOING TO MOVE
TO HAVE THE BOOK ADMITTED.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.442
- THERE GOES RAPE SHIELD.
- YEP.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.744
THEY'RE GONNA FIND WHATEVER
LOVER INSPIRED THE BOOK.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.946
HE'LL TESTIFY THAT SHE LIKED IT
ROUGH FROM BEHIND.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.615
GAME OVER.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
- WELL, IT'S BETTER
IF WE FIND THE GUY FIRST.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.419
- JOCELYN WENT TO SILVER SPRING
COLLEGE IN MARYLAND.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.488
WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THERE
TOMORROW MORNING.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.555
- TRY TONIGHT.
ONCE WE ARRAIGNED CAIN,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.291
THE CLOCK STARTED TICKING.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.758
FIVE DAYS TO INDICT
OR THE JUDGE RELEASES HIM.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.627
- YEAH,
AND HE'LL GO BACK ON TV,

20:27.627 --> 20:28.895
HE'LL MOCK JOCELYN
EVERY NIGHT UNTIL SHE FOLDS.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.398
WE GOTTA GO NOW.
- NO, NOT YOU TWO.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.801
JOCELYN SEES YOU AS ADVOCATES.
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY, HM?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.507
- JOCELYN AND I
WERE TOGETHER FOUR YEARS.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.542
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA GET MARRIED.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.778
- SO SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.
- SHE SAID IT WAS HER, NOT ME.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.480
SHE HAD SO MUCH
GOING ON WITH THE BOOK.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.749
- SO SHE WAS WRITING A LOT.
- I GUESS.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.551
SHE WAS REALLY SECRETIVE
ABOUT IT.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.785
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS WORKING ON IT,

20:52.785 --> 20:54.487
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.456
- SO WHEN'D SHE FINALLY
TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOK?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.991
- SHE DIDN'T.
I BORROWED MY MOM'S COPY.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.661
- DID YOU FEEL LIKE
YOUR PRIVACY WAS VIOLATED?

21:01.661 --> 21:03.463
- WELL, YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE

21:03.463 --> 21:05.632
ASKED ME PERSONAL QUESTIONS
AFTER.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.700
- LIKE ARE YOU INTO ROUGH STUFF
AND DOMINATION?

21:07.700 --> 21:10.570
- YEAH, EXCEPT WE DIDN'T DO
ANY OF THAT.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.474
I MEAN, WE MIXED IT UP.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.344
SOMETIMES I WAS ON TOP.
SOMETIMES SHE WAS.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.346
- DO YOU KNOW ANY
OF HER OTHER BOYFRIENDS?

21:19.346 --> 21:20.847
- SHE TOLD ME I WAS HER FIRST.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.983
- YOU BELIEVE HER?
- WELL, SHE WAS MY FIRST.

21:23.983 --> 21:28.054
- THANK YOU.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.622
- THANKS.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.524
ROOMMATE NUMBER THREE.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.994
IF JOCELYN WAS INTO BDSM,
SHE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.563
- MAYBE SHE WAS
WITH A PROFESSOR

21:36.563 --> 21:38.431
THAT DOESN'T WANT
TO GET CALLED OUT.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.500
- OR SHE JUST RESEARCHED IT,
LIKE ALL HER OTHER REFERENCES

21:40.500 --> 21:43.470
TO RENAISSANCE EROTIC IMAGERY
AND SEXUAL AWAKENINGS.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.772
- YOU CAN PUT A DIPLOMA ON IT.
PORN IS PORN.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.040
- SEE, THAT'S THE THING--
JOCELYN'S HIGHBROW REFERENCES.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.076
I READ HER BLOGS
AND HER TWEETS.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.612
AND HER IDEA
OF A SEXUAL CULTURAL REFERENCE

21:52.612 --> 21:54.747
IS GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.849
- YOU MEAN THAT
GINGER/MARY ANN THING.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.519
- YOU THINK SHE'S NOT SHOWING
ENOUGH DEPTH IN HER TWEETS?

21:59.519 --> 22:01.454
- SHE DIDN'T RESEARCH THIS
IN THE LIBRARY.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.022
SHE'S LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.558
KINKS LIKE THIS JUST DON'T
SPRING UP OVERNIGHT.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.597
- YEAH, ADAM CAIN
RECOMMENDED ME.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.064
SO WHAT?

22:12.064 --> 22:14.467
- SO YOU WENT
FROM BEING HIS INTERN

22:14.467 --> 22:16.736
TO A PRODUCER ON A FOOD SHOW
IN TWO MONTHS.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.070
THAT'S PRETTY FAST.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.072
- HE PUT IN A GOOD WORD.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.874
- YEAH?
DID YOU HEAR THAT, UM,

22:21.874 --> 22:24.944
CAIN WAS ONLY ALLOWED
MALE INTERNS AFTER YOU LEFT?

22:24.944 --> 22:26.779
- WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH ME?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.615
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW YOU HAD
TO COME INTO WORK

22:28.615 --> 22:31.451
WITH A BROKEN WRIST,
ALL THOSE BRUISES ON YOUR NECK?

22:36.723 --> 22:40.026
- DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.028
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU KEEP IT LOCKED INSIDE,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.664
IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.638
- LOOK...
I WENT HOME WITH HIM.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.106
I WANTED TO HAVE SEX
WITH HIM...

22:54.106 --> 22:56.643
UNTIL HE STARTED
TO HURT ME.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.878
- AND YOU ASKED HIM
TO STOP.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.514
- SO WHAT IF I DID?

23:01.514 --> 23:04.016
I'VE MOVED ON.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.786
- KATIE, BY KEEPING QUIET,

23:06.786 --> 23:09.155
YOU'RE GIVING HIM
POWER OVER YOU.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.558
- BETTER THAN THAT MONOLOGUE
HE DID ABOUT JOCELYN PALEY.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.660
I DON'T NEED THAT.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.466
HE'S NOT REALLY A BAD GUY.

23:19.466 --> 23:22.635
IT'S JUST WHEN HE GETS
THAT BELT IN HIS HANDS,

23:22.635 --> 23:24.871
HE LOSES IT.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.886
- SHE WAS IN MY 15TH CENTURY
ITALIAN LITERATURE CLASS.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.589
I WAS HER ADVISOR.
- SO...

23:42.589 --> 23:45.091
YOU WERE CLOSE.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.094
HAVE YOU READ HER BOOK?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.997
- I OVERHEARD FACULTY
TALK ABOUT IT.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.500
- WELL, JOCELYN
SEEMS PRETTY, UH,

23:53.500 --> 23:55.668
UNSOPHISTICATED
FOR THAT WORLD.

23:55.668 --> 24:00.106
ANY IDEA HOW SHE GOT INVOLVED
WITH DOMINATION, SUBMISSION?

24:00.106 --> 24:02.108
- I HONESTLY COULDN'T SAY.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.745
- WELL, HER HEROINE
GETS DOMINATED BY AN OLDER MAN.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.815
ANY PROFESSORS HERE WHO MIGHT
HAVE INSPIRED THAT STORY?

24:08.815 --> 24:12.519
- TEN YEARS AGO, YES.
BUT...THESE DAYS?

24:12.519 --> 24:13.920
- I HEAR YOU.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.155
WELL, HEY,
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.491
- PLEASURE.
- MM.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.727
THAT'S A PRETTY FANCY PIANO.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.062
- IT'S A HARPSICHORD.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.498
THEY SAY IT BELONGED
TO ALBINONI.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.166
- ALBINONI?
- MM-HMM.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.536
- YEAH, MY WIFE,
SHE LOVES HIS, UH...

24:29.536 --> 24:31.538
WHAT WAS THAT FAMOUS PIECE
OF HIS?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.172
- HIS ADAGIO?
- ADAGIO.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.508
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.176
IT'S HIS MOST WELL-KNOWN WORK.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.812
AND FUNNY THING IS,
IT ISN'T HIS.

24:39.812 --> 24:43.149
HIS BIOGRAPHER COMPOSED IT
TWO CENTURIES LATER.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.718
- NO KIDDING.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.219
- WE SPOKE TO
JOCELYN'S BOYFRIEND, TEACHERS,

24:47.219 --> 24:48.855
AND ROOMMATES.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.658
THE DARKEST SHE EVER GOT
BEFORE THIS NOVEL WAS SASSY.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.526
- SO SHE'S BEEN
TELLING US THE TRUTH.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.528
- ANY OTHER CAIN VICTIMS?
- THERE'S THREE INTERNS.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.598
HE BROKE ONE OF THEIR WRISTS,
BUT EVEN SHE WON'T TESTIFY.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.066
- SHE INSISTS
THAT CAIN'S A GOOD GUY

25:00.066 --> 25:01.701
EXCEPT WHEN HE HAS
A BELT IN HIS HAND.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.670
- NO WITNESSES.
HE SAID, SHE SAID.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.071
AT LEAST THAT MEANS
HE'LL TAKE THE STAND.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.306
- IT'S AMARO.
- HE DIDN'T COME BACK WITH YOU?

25:07.306 --> 25:09.542
- HE'S LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE DOWN THERE.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.243
- HEY, NICK, YOU'RE ON
SPEAKER PHONE WITH THE D.A.--

25:11.243 --> 25:13.746
- FOUR DAYS, YOU CAN'T FIND
THE GUY WHO GOT HER INTO THIS?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.548
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- MAYBE WE'RE ASKING

25:15.548 --> 25:16.749
THE WRONG QUESTION.
LOOK, I NEED ANOTHER DAY.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.250
- DON'T HAVE IT.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.252
I'M TAKING JOCELYN
TO THE GRAND JURY NOW.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.793
- I WAS INVITED
ONTO ADAM CAIN'S TALK SHOW

25:26.793 --> 25:28.595
TO DISCUSS THE BOOK
I HAD WRITTEN.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.062
- TWENTY-FIVE ACTS.
- YES.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.330
- WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE SHOW?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.065
- ADAM CAIN TOOK ME OUT
FOR DRINKS,

25:33.065 --> 25:34.734
THEN TO HIS APARTMENT.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.235
WE WERE GETTING INTIMATE,

25:36.235 --> 25:40.573
THEN SUDDENLY
HE JUST TURNED VIOLENT.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.875
- ALL I CAN SAY,
TODAY'S GRAND JURY INDICTMENT

25:42.875 --> 25:44.644
IS THE FIRST STEP
TOWARDS ACHIEVING JUSTICE

25:44.644 --> 25:46.746
FOR JOCELYN PALEY.
- THE D.A.'S OFFICE

25:46.746 --> 25:48.214
IS DESPERATELY
TRYING TO DISTRACT

25:48.214 --> 25:50.617
FROM THEIR RECENT SCANDAL
WITH A HIGH-PROFILE CASE.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.619
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT--WHETHER
YOU'RE A JOHN IN THE SOUTH BRONX

25:52.619 --> 25:54.320
OR A $3-MILLION-A-YEAR
TALK SHOW HOST,

25:54.320 --> 25:56.656
NO MEANS NO.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.124
- WHEN THE JURY COMPARES
HER ACCUSATIONS

25:58.124 --> 26:00.259
WITH THE CHAPTERS
FROM HER BOOK,

26:00.259 --> 26:02.895
THIS CASE FALLS APART
LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.564
THAT'S ALL I GOT TODAY,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.368
- DETECTIVE,
I'M JUST ON MY WAY HOME.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.938
- WELL, I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.873
YOU KNOW, I SPENT THE NIGHT
READING YOUR WORK.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.208
YOU'RE QUITE PROLIFIC.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.078
- ACADEMIA:
PUBLISH OR PERISH.

26:19.078 --> 26:23.115
- I LIKE THE ARTICLE YOU WROTE
ON THE ECSTASY OF ST. TERESA.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.052
"THE PAIN WAS SO GREAT
THAT IT MADE ME MOAN..."

26:26.052 --> 26:30.056
- "OVER AND OVER AND THROUGH ME
INTO SWEET DELIGHT."

26:30.056 --> 26:31.958
IT'S FROM HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.693
- OH, YOU TAUGHT IT
IN CLASS.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.729
WELL, THIS IS FROM
JOCELYN'S BOOK, UH...

26:36.729 --> 26:39.699
"THE PAIN WAS SO GREAT,
SUCH SWEET DELIGHT,

26:39.699 --> 26:42.168
I MOANED OVER AND OVER."

26:42.168 --> 26:44.336
- DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS PAYING
SUCH CLOSE ATTENTION.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.339
- HUH.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.409
YOU KNOW, SHE'S MAKING
MILLIONS A WEEK.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.411
YOU HAVE A CASE HERE
FOR PLAGIARISM.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.114
- PLEASE, NO.
LAST THING I NEED

26:55.114 --> 26:57.650
IS TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH A BOOK LIKE THAT.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.952
- OH, WELL, NOW I GET IT.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.688
YOUR ANTIQUE HARPSICHORD--

27:01.688 --> 27:03.890
SOMEONE BOUGHT IT LAST MONTH
AT SOTHEBY'S

27:03.890 --> 27:08.260
FOR $285,000.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.336
- MORE QUESTIONS?
WHY?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.371
- WE'RE WORRIED THE DEFENSE
IS GOING TO PRODUCE THE MAN

27:19.371 --> 27:21.040
THAT YOU BASED THE BOOK ON.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.142
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S FICTION.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.376
- BUT, JOCELYN,
IT'S SO SPECIFIC,

27:24.376 --> 27:26.713
YOU MUST HAVE EXPERIMENTED
WITH SUBMISSION.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.415
- WELL, IN COLLEGE.
- NOT WITH CRAIG.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.284
COME ON, THE ONLY KNOTS
HE'S EVER TIED

27:32.284 --> 27:34.286
WAS WHEN HE WAS
IN THE BOY SCOUTS.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.923
- YEAH, NOT CRAIG.
ANOTHER GUY.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.324
- OH, SO YOU CHEATED ON HIM.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.026
- WHAT?
NO.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.194
- NO?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.363
- I DID A SEMESTER ABROAD.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.934
THE CHARACTER'S
BASED ON...

27:47.934 --> 27:49.435
SOMEONE I MET IN THE VILLA.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.704
HE WAS INTO BONDAGE.
WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?

27:51.704 --> 27:53.372
- WHERE'D YOU MEET HIM?
A HOTEL?

27:53.372 --> 27:56.475
HIS HOME?
DO YOU HAVE HIS ADDRESS?

27:56.475 --> 27:59.478
- I DON'T.
WHAT IS THIS, 20 QUESTIONS?

27:59.478 --> 28:03.349
- NO, JOCELYN, JUST ONE.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.052
WHO WROTE THE BOOK?

28:17.029 --> 28:20.366
- YOU FOUND OUT?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.433
HOW?

28:21.433 --> 28:22.301
- I TOLD YOU THE FIRST DAY

28:22.301 --> 28:24.470
THE ONE THING YOU DECIDE
NOT TO TELL US

28:24.470 --> 28:27.006
IS THE ONE THING THE DEFENSE
IS GONNA USE TO DESTROY YOU.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.875
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

28:28.875 --> 28:33.145
- BARBA, SHE GETS IT.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.814
- DO THEY KNOW?

28:34.814 --> 28:38.484
- NO, BUT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TELL THEM.

28:38.484 --> 28:43.022
- NO, N--YOU CAN'T.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.525
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.
IT'LL...RUIN MY CAREER.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.194
MY LIFE.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.497
PLEASE DON'T--
DON'T TELL ANYONE.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.173
- IT WAS PROFESSOR DOBSON'S
IDEA

29:01.173 --> 29:02.474
TO PUT MY NAME ON THE BOOK.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.176
SHE IS AN ACADEMIC.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.012
SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT HER REPUTATION.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.880
- AND YOU WEREN'T WORRIED
ABOUT YOURS?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.816
- I OWE $90,000
IN COLLEGE DEBT.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.852
THE YEAR BEFORE THIS
I MADE $2,600 WRITING.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.788
SHE GAVE ME 10%.
I'VE MADE CONNECTIONS.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.456
- YOU WERE RAPED.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.292
- AND YOU LIED
TO THE GRAND JURY.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.829
- I HAD TO. IF I EVER SAY
I DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK,

29:22.829 --> 29:24.130
I LOSE ALL THE MONEY.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.898
- THAT'S PART
OF THE BOOK CONTRACT?

29:25.898 --> 29:28.234
- YES.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.302
I-I WANNA DROP THE CHARGES.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.004
I CAN'T TESTIFY.
- DROP THE CHARGES,

29:32.004 --> 29:33.906
AND YOUR SECRET'S
GONNA COME OUT ANYWAY

29:33.906 --> 29:35.474
WHEN I INDICT YOU.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.477
LYING TO THE GRAND JURY?
THAT'S A CRIME.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.279
- YOU'LL INDICT ME?

29:40.279 --> 29:43.482
- YOU DON'T TESTIFY,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT PERJURY.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.985
- [stammering]
I CAN'T.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.157
- THAT WAS HARDBALL.
- I WASN'T PLAYING.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.193
- YEAH, I GOT THAT.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.963
DOES THIS IN ANY WAY
POSSIBLY HELP US?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.965
YOU WERE WORRIED
THAT THE JURY

29:58.965 --> 30:00.199
WAS GONNA HOLD THE BOOK
AGAINST HER,

30:00.199 --> 30:02.568
BUT SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT,
SO...

30:02.568 --> 30:04.503
- THEY'LL SEE HER
AS A LIAR.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.577
- MISS PALEY,
COULD YOU TELL THE JURY

30:11.577 --> 30:14.380
WHY YOU AGREED
TO SAY YOU WROTE THIS BOOK?

30:14.380 --> 30:17.049
- I HAD COLLEGE DEBT.
MY PARENTS ARE WORKING CLASS.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.885
WE NEEDED THE MONEY.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.452
- SO YOU DIDN'T
WRITE ONE WORD OF THE BOOK?

30:20.452 --> 30:23.289
YOU'RE NOT INTO BEING...
DOMINATED?

30:23.289 --> 30:26.192
- I WAS PLAYING A ROLE.
IT'S NOT ME.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.494
- BUT IT WAS YOU WHO FLIRTED
WITH THE DEFENDANT

30:28.494 --> 30:31.130
AND WENT HOME WITH HIM
THAT NIGHT.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.199
- IT ALL SEEMED
GLAMOROUS AT FIRST.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.067
HE WAS CHARMING.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.470
I WANTED TO HAVE SEX,
UNTIL HE STARTED HURTING ME.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.073
- AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?
- I ASKED HIM TO STOP.

30:41.073 --> 30:44.076
- DID HE?

30:44.076 --> 30:47.413
DID HE?

30:50.149 --> 30:52.919
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.254
- NO, HE DID NOT.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.157
HE FORCED HIMSELF INSIDE ME,

30:58.157 --> 30:59.225
CHOKED ME WITH HIS BELT.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.593
I COULDN'T TALK.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.563
THE MORE I CRIED,
THE MORE HE HU--HURT ME.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.565
- AND THE NEXT NIGHT,
MISS PALEY,

31:06.565 --> 31:08.634
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

31:08.634 --> 31:11.203
- ADAM CAIN STALKED ME
AT A MAGAZINE PARTY,

31:11.203 --> 31:16.375
TRAPPED ME IN AN ELEVATOR,
AND RAPED ME...AGAIN.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.677
- CAN YOU TELL THE JURY
WHAT CONSEQUENCES YOU FACE

31:18.677 --> 31:21.981
FOR TELLING THE TRUTH
HERE TODAY?

31:21.981 --> 31:24.616
- I HAVE TO RETURN
ALL OF MY ROYALTIES.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.553
MY REPUTATION IS RUINED.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.989
I'VE WANTED TO WRITE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.059
- THANK YOU, MISS PALEY.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.626
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU LIED
ABOUT WRITING THE BOOK

31:34.626 --> 31:37.329
TWENTY-FIVE ACTS?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.131
- I'M NOT SURE.

31:39.131 --> 31:42.368
- YOU LIED WHEN YOU CONSENTED
TO HAVE YOUR NAME ON THE COVER.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.036
- YES.
- AND YOU LIED

31:44.036 --> 31:46.638
AT SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS,
PARTIES, AND INTERVIEWS

31:46.638 --> 31:48.975
IN OVER TEN CITIES
ON YOUR BOOK TOUR.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.709
- YES.
- AND YOU LIED

31:50.709 --> 31:52.578
ON MR. CAIN'S TV SHOW?

31:52.578 --> 31:55.581
BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT,
MISS PALEY--

31:55.581 --> 31:58.250
DEFENSE EXHIBIT 12,
YOUR HONOR.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.152
- SO, JOCELYN, TELL ME,

32:00.152 --> 32:03.589
WHY DO WOMEN
WANT TO BE DOMINATED?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.158
- WOMEN DO IT ALL THESE DAYS.
CAREER, KIDS.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.593
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT A MAN

32:07.593 --> 32:10.129
TO THROW THEM DOWN
AND TAKE CONTROL.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.632
- AND IS THIS
YOUR PERSONAL FANTASY?

32:13.632 --> 32:16.969
- MY FANTASY...
BEING HERE WITH YOU.

32:16.969 --> 32:21.140
[laughter]

32:21.140 --> 32:23.075
- WAS WHAT WE JUST SAW
A LIE TOO?

32:23.075 --> 32:26.378
- I WAS PLAYING A PART,
FLIRTING.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.647
- PLAYING A ROLE FOR PUBLICITY,
MONEY.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.516
- YES.
- WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU DO

32:30.516 --> 32:32.518
FOR MONEY?
LIE ABOUT RAPE?

32:32.518 --> 32:35.487
SUE MY CLIENT?
- NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.689
- YOU WOULDN'T LIE
ABOUT SEX FOR MONEY?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.225
- NO.
- BUT YOU HAVE LIED

32:39.225 --> 32:41.027
ABOUT SEX FOR MONEY
IN THE PAST.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.129
- I'M TELLING
THE TRUTH NOW.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.697
- I SEE. AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT
THE JURY TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

32:45.697 --> 32:48.067
WITHDRAWN.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.739
- I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.374
- YOU TOLD THEM
WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.642
YOU CONFRONTED HIM.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.744
NO ONE CAN TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM YOU.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.347
- THAT WAS BRUTAL.
- WE'VE GOT ONE HAIL MARY.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.682
PROFESSOR DOBSON, I CAN USE HER
TO REHABILITATE.

33:03.682 --> 33:07.053
- SHE AGREED TO COME?
- SURE, AFTER I SUBPOENAED HER.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.391
PROFESSOR DOBSON,

33:12.391 --> 33:15.727
DID YOU WRITE TWENTY-FIVE ACTS?
- YES.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.364
I'M AFRAID SO.
THE ENTIRE BOOK.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.132
- AND WHO, UH--
WHO DECIDED

33:20.132 --> 33:22.634
TO PUT JOCELYN PALEY
ON THE COVER?

33:22.634 --> 33:24.736
- I DID.
I KNEW THAT TALK SHOW HOSTS

33:24.736 --> 33:27.706
WOULDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS
MY SEXUAL FANTASIES.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.575
- SO THESE FANTASIES
IN THE BOOK,

33:29.575 --> 33:32.511
THESE ARE YOUR FANTASIES,
NOT JOCELYN'S.

33:32.511 --> 33:36.282
- YES, ALL OF THEM.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.450
- BEFORE JOCELYN AGREED
TO HELP YOU,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.819
DID SHE KNOW
THE SUBJECT MATTER?

33:40.819 --> 33:43.222
- HARDLY.
WHEN SHE READ THE DRAFT,

33:43.222 --> 33:45.324
SHE WAS...SHOCKED.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.559
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
SHE'D BE THE PERFECT FRONT.

33:47.559 --> 33:50.396
- WHY WAS THAT?
- SHE WAS A SWEET GIRL.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.064
AND THE CONTRAST
BETWEEN HER INNOCENCE

33:52.064 --> 33:53.732
AND THE BOOK'S
INTENSE SEXUALITY

33:53.732 --> 33:55.834
WAS COMPELLING.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.670
- HAS IT BEEN HARD FOR YOU
TO OUT YOURSELF?

33:58.670 --> 34:01.340
- IN MY WORLD, I'M BETWEEN
A PARIAH AND A LAUGHINGSTOCK.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.742
THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO USE JOCELYN'S NAME.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.778
BUT TO THINK THAT SOMEONE WOULD
ASCRIBE MY FANTASIES TO HER

34:06.778 --> 34:09.448
AND USE THAT AS
A SMOKESCREEN FOR ASSAULT...

34:09.448 --> 34:13.319
WELL, IT SICKENS ME.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.586
- ABOUT THOSE FANTASIES
IN YOUR BOOK--

34:14.586 --> 34:16.788
DID ANYONE ELSE KNOW
THAT JOCELYN PALEY

34:16.788 --> 34:18.724
WASN'T THE REAL AUTHOR?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.726
- NO.
- SO THE REST OF THE WORLD,

34:20.726 --> 34:23.462
INCLUDING MR. CAIN,
BELIEVED THE BOOK WAS BASED

34:23.462 --> 34:26.365
ON JOCELYN PALEY'S FANTASIES?

34:26.365 --> 34:27.799
- I SUPPOSE SO.
- THAT SHE WAS THE ONE

34:27.799 --> 34:30.736
WHO FANTASIZED
ABOUT BEING DOMINATED,

34:30.736 --> 34:35.207
HAVING ROUGH SEX,
HAVING SEX IN AN ELEVATOR?

34:35.207 --> 34:37.676
- YES.
- AND YOU CHOSE MISS PALEY

34:37.676 --> 34:40.812
BECAUSE SHE WAS
A SWEET, INNOCENT GIRL?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.214
- YES.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.450
- YOU'RE A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.819
YOU MUST SEE A LOT
OF SWEET, INNOCENT GIRLS.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.855
- NOT AS MANY
AS YOU'D THINK.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.391
- WHAT MADE JOCELYN PALEY

34:52.391 --> 34:55.194
THE RIGHT CHOICE?
- AS I SAID,

34:55.194 --> 34:57.129
IT WAS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN
HER INNOCENCE

34:57.129 --> 34:58.730
AND THE SUBJECT MATTER.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.133
- OR WAS IT BECAUSE
SHE'S A GOOD LIAR?

35:01.133 --> 35:02.634
DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE JOCELYN PALEY

35:02.634 --> 35:05.304
BECAUSE SHE IS
A CONVINCING ENOUGH LIAR

35:05.304 --> 35:07.739
TO SELL 5 MILLION COPIES
OF A BOOK

35:07.739 --> 35:10.609
ABOUT A FETISHISTIC WORLD

35:10.609 --> 35:12.811
THAT SHE CLAIMS
TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT?

35:12.811 --> 35:14.213
- OBJECTION.

35:14.213 --> 35:18.217
- WITHDRAWN.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.354
DID YOU RAPE MISS PALEY?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.723
- I DON'T NEED
TO RAPE ANYONE, THANK YOU.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.726
I DO FINE WITH VOLUNTEERS.
- SO...

35:27.726 --> 35:29.495
YOU'VE HAD
A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.796
- MY FAIR SHARE.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.731
IT HELPS TO HAVE
A HIT TV SHOW,

35:32.731 --> 35:34.666
PLUS I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT MY--

35:34.666 --> 35:37.603
MY COMPANY ISN'T
ENTIRELY UNPLEASANT.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.706
- HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
THE DOMINANT ROLE

35:40.706 --> 35:42.174
IN SEXUAL GAMES?

35:42.174 --> 35:43.675
- I FOLLOW MY PARTNER'S LEAD.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.378
IF THAT'S THEIR PLEASURE,
I'M GLAD TO OBLIGE.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.679
- WHAT WAS
MISS PALEY'S PLEASURE?

35:47.679 --> 35:50.882
- A MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY
ROUGH SEX GAME

35:50.882 --> 35:52.718
INITIATED BY HER.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.587
HER FALSE ACCUSATION
IS UNFORTUNATE.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.789
IT SMEARS REAL VICTIMS OF RAPE
WHO MAY NOT BE BELIEVED.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.358
- MOVE TO STRIKE.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.360
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTIONS,
MR. CAIN.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.794
- NOTHING FURTHER,
YOUR HONOR.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.963
- IT'S LATE, MR. BARBA.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.765
- HOW ABOUT A HALF-HOUR NOW,

36:06.765 --> 36:08.367
AND THEN WE CAN--
- NICE TRY.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.770
WE'RE ADJOURNED.
[taps gavel]

36:14.906 --> 36:16.742
- THE PROFESSOR
DIDN'T HELP US.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.378
- I'M CALLING IT A DRAW.
- SO YOU'RE AN OPTIMIST.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.512
- STUBBORN.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.881
AH, THE CAVALRY.
- NO LUCK.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.817
ALL THREE OF HIS PAST VICTIMS
HAVE MAGICALLY DISAPPEARED.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.920
- WE CAN'T GET INTO ANY
OF CAIN'S PRIOR BAD ACTS.

36:28.920 --> 36:33.459
- MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM
TO OPEN THE DOOR.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.397
- JOCELYN AND I?

36:38.397 --> 36:40.766
THERE WAS A LOT OF HEAT.
IT WAS EXCITING.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.534
- SHE REMEMBERS IT DIFFERENTLY.
- SHE WAS PLAYING THE ROLE

36:42.534 --> 36:44.970
OF A SEXUAL SUBMISSIVE.
NOW SHE'S PLAYING VICTIM.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.674
- PRETENDING TO BE
A SEXUAL SUBMISSIVE?

36:48.674 --> 36:50.642
- SHE JUST TOLD US THAT.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.311
- THAT'S RIGHT.
[laughs]

36:52.311 --> 36:56.014
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.650
SHE WAS INEXPERIENCED.
BUT YOU WEREN'T.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.452
- NOT ENTIRELY.
- MR. CAIN...

37:00.452 --> 37:05.624
WHAT...EXCITES YOU
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH JOCELYN?

37:05.624 --> 37:08.660
- [chuckles]
WHAT EXCITES ANYONE ABOUT SEX?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.630
- WAS IT THE BELT?

37:11.630 --> 37:13.399
THE BELT THAT WAS HER IDEA,
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS PRETENDING.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.767
- SHE WANTED
TO TRY ROLE PLAY.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.671
- HOW DO YOU START
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

37:19.671 --> 37:21.673
- WITH THE BELT?
- YEAH, I MEAN,

37:21.673 --> 37:23.809
DO YOU TAKE YOUR BELT OFF OR--
[laughs]

37:23.809 --> 37:25.811
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- AND YOU GIVE HER

37:25.811 --> 37:26.812
A FEW HITS WITH IT?

37:26.812 --> 37:29.481
- SHE SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.749
- THEN YOU PUT THE BELT
AROUND HER NECK.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.752
- YES.
- AND THEN YOU GET BEHIND HER...

37:33.752 --> 37:35.421
TIGHTEN IT.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.922
- YES,
TO INCREASE HER PLEASURE.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.658
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS HAS TO--
- JUST BEAR WITH ME.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.627
WHERE WAS THE BUCKLE?

37:41.627 --> 37:42.628
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC.

37:42.628 --> 37:43.895
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO SHOW YOU?

37:43.895 --> 37:46.632
- WELL, ACTUALLY...
- OBJECTION! YOUR HONOR--

37:46.632 --> 37:49.868
- AS A REGULAR JOE,
I AM CURIOUS

37:49.868 --> 37:52.338
ABOUT HOW THIS BELT-AROUND-
THE-NECK THING IS EXCITING.

37:52.338 --> 37:56.642
I AM SURE, YOUR HONOR, THAT
THE JURY IS CURIOUS AS WELL.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.344
- I'LL ALLOW IT.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.946
FOR NOW.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.948
- SO LET'S GO BACK.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.651
YOU TOOK OFF YOUR BELT.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.419
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- YOU DID IT.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.755
NOT HER.
- CORRECT.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.391
- YOU LOOPED THE BELT
LIKE THIS.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.663
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.731
- YOU LED HER TO THE BED...

38:19.731 --> 38:21.867
GOT ON TOP, PULLED IT.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.068
- THE GAME SHE WANTED TO PLAY.
- SHE'S THE ONE

38:23.068 --> 38:24.803
WHO WANTED IT ROUGH?
- YES.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.738
- BUT YOU DIDN'T RAPE HER?
- NO, WE'VE GONE OVER THIS.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.474
WHAT DON'T YOU GET?
- OH, I GET IT.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.376
IT'S THE CLASSIC MINDSET
OF THE RAPIST

38:30.376 --> 38:31.643
TO ADMIT WHAT YOU CAN'T DENY,
DENY WHAT YOU CAN'T ADMIT.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.944
- OBJECTION!
- WITHDRAWN.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.613
YOU SAID
THAT SHE WANTED IT ROUGH,

38:34.613 --> 38:36.482
SO SHOW ME HOW SHE LIKES IT.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.750
SHOW ME, SHOW ME.
LET ME SEE HOW SHE LIKED IT.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.951
- OBJECTION!

38:39.951 --> 38:41.653
- LET'S PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY,
MR. BARBA.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.790
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE THE BELT
IN YOUR HANDS, MR. CAIN.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.361
FEEL THE LEATHER?

38:49.361 --> 38:51.797
HOLD THE BELT...

38:54.366 --> 38:58.570
NOW, SHOW ME HOW
YOU PULLED ON THE BELT.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.806
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.444
[scoffs]
YOU CALL THAT BEING DOMINANT?

39:05.444 --> 39:06.945
SHOW ME.
SHOW ME!

39:06.945 --> 39:08.647
SHOW ME, PULL IT!

39:08.647 --> 39:10.616
PULL IT.
PULL IT!

39:10.616 --> 39:12.684
TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE IT!

39:12.684 --> 39:13.952
SHOW ME HOW YOU LIKE IT,
MR. CAIN!

39:13.952 --> 39:15.621
COME ON, PULL IT, PULL IT!
- LIKE THIS!

39:15.621 --> 39:17.923
- YOUR HONOR!
[Barba gasping]

39:17.923 --> 39:19.658
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT IS ENOUGH, MR. BARBA!

39:19.658 --> 39:23.529
[Barba coughing]

39:29.868 --> 39:31.803
- NOT A MARK.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.805
[laughs]

39:33.805 --> 39:36.141
NOT A MARK.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.811
NOT A MARK.
PEOPLE'S EXHIBIT 20.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.749
JOCELYN PALEY'S NECK
AFTER THEIR CONSENSUAL SEX GAME.

39:43.749 --> 39:47.719
IS THIS WHAT EXCITES YOU
ABOUT SEX, MR. CAIN?

39:47.719 --> 39:50.456
HURTING YOUR VICTIMS?

39:50.456 --> 39:54.793
- SHE LIKED IT LIKE THAT.

39:54.793 --> 39:59.465
- YOU MEAN JOCELYN?

39:59.465 --> 40:02.601
YOU LIKED IT LIKE THAT.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.072
SHE DIDN'T.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.679
[light knock]

40:13.679 --> 40:15.881
- HEY. THREE DAYS,
JURY'S STILL OUT.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.783
LONGER THAN THE TRIAL,
HUH?

40:17.783 --> 40:19.818
- SVU--IT'S THE ONLY UNIT

40:19.818 --> 40:22.020
WHERE THE VICTIM'S WORD
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.590
YOU HAVE TO PROVE
THAT A CRIME WAS COMMITTED.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.957
- THAT'S TRUE.
THEY DON'T ASK

40:25.957 --> 40:28.560
ROBBERY VICTIMS
IF THEY WANTED IT.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.861
- GOING SOMEWHERE?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.763
- GOOD NEWS.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.965
YOUR CAPTAIN'S COMING BACK.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.937
- WELL, YOU MUST BE RELIEVED.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.907
I HOPE YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT
IS EASIER THAN THIS ONE.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.175
- THEY NEVER ARE.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.778
I'M JUST PAID TO FIX.
YOU COULD DO IT.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.747
YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
MOVING UP THE RANKS?

40:48.747 --> 40:52.718
- UH, IT'S COME UP, BUT...

40:52.718 --> 40:55.821
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO SUPERVISE ANYONE LIKE ME.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.491
- YEAH. WELL, I HAVE FRIENDS
OVER AT 1 PP.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.560
YOU EVER NEED A RABBI.
- THANKS.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.496
I GOT CRAGEN.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.098
- WON'T BE THE SAME,
YOU KNOW.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.804
- I KNOW.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.607
[cell phone rings]

41:15.607 --> 41:17.776
AH! JURY'S IN.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.945
THEY'VE REACHED A VERDICT.

41:19.945 --> 41:23.649
- GOOD LUCK.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.724
- ON THE CHARGE OF RAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

41:32.724 --> 41:34.225
HOW DO YOU FIND?

41:34.225 --> 41:36.995
- WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
ADAM CAIN GUILTY.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.532
- BAILIFF, TAKE THE DEFENDANT
INTO CUSTODY.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.087
- CONGRATULATIONS, COUNSELOR.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.022
- GOOD JURY.
THEY LOOKED PAST CAIN'S IMAGE,

42:04.022 --> 42:06.858
SAW HIM FOR
WHO HE REALLY IS.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.194
- YOU TOLD ME I WOULDN'T
LIKE YOU WHEN THIS WAS OVER.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.731
YOU WERE RIGHT.

42:12.731 --> 42:15.200
WHAT DO I DO NOW?
MY REPUTATION'S--

42:15.200 --> 42:17.869
- THING ABOUT AMERICA--
THIS COUNTRY LOVES A COMEBACK.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.876
[reporters shouting]

42:24.876 --> 42:27.112
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

42:27.112 --> 42:31.282
[indistinct chatter]
