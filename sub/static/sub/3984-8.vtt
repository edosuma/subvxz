WEBVTT

02:07.200 --> 02:09.645
Your Grace, I want to say...

02:09.720 --> 02:11.085
You will not speak.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.689
How do I know you are who you say you are?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.330
If only I were otherwise.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.324
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

02:21.400 --> 02:23.971
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

02:24.080 --> 02:26.560
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

02:26.640 --> 02:30.167
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.843
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.761
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.002
So I should welcome you into my service

02:39.080 --> 02:41.208
because you murdered members
of your own family?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.444
Into your service?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.607
We have only just met.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.368
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.485
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,
just say the word.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.048
When I was a young man, I heard a story

03:00.120 --> 03:02.964
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.488
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

03:07.560 --> 03:10.086
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

03:10.160 --> 03:12.891
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.440
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

03:15.520 --> 03:18.410
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.802
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

03:21.880 --> 03:23.689
and that appeared to be that.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.325
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

03:28.640 --> 03:31.246
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

03:31.320 --> 03:34.722
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.564
along with three dragons.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.841
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.641
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.404
And why are you worth meeting?

03:47.480 --> 03:49.403
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

03:49.480 --> 03:52.165
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.086
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

03:56.160 --> 03:59.084
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will either join or oppose you.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.322
I will have a very large army.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.560
And very large dragons.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.160
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.411
When I served as Hand of the King,
I did quite well with the latter,

04:10.520 --> 04:11.806
considering the king in question

04:11.880 --> 04:15.168
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

04:15.640 --> 04:19.166
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.649
If that is indeed what you are.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.329
So you want to advise me?

04:26.840 --> 04:28.205
Very well.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.530
What would you have me do with him?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.405
I swore I would kill him
if he ever returned.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.771
I know.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.967
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

04:49.360 --> 04:52.250
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

04:52.440 --> 04:54.169
he is no longer that man.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.727
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

04:57.800 --> 04:59.529
as he is to serving you.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.600
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

05:02.680 --> 05:05.684
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.570
And yet he did betray you.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.846
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.247
Yes.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.082
Many opportunities.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.763
- And did he?
- No.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.081
Not until forced to do so.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.168
He worships you.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.361
He is in love with you, I think.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.002
But he did not trust you with the truth.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.442
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.523
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.483
So I should kill him?

06:01.440 --> 06:05.843
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.689
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion, a lot of it,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.730
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.528
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.802
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.721
Confess.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.086
My son...

07:41.880 --> 07:43.325
Let me speak to...

07:44.120 --> 07:45.565
Confess.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.846
I meant it.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.922
My face will be the last thing you see...

08:07.680 --> 08:10.763
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.891
When I was eight, I begged enough money
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.850
I sold that bucket and made enough money
to buy two more.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.089
It took a While,

08:25.160 --> 08:28.607
but I finally saved enough
to buy myself an oyster cart.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.849
Now every morning,
I make my way down to the canals.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.844
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.610
I usually see Lhara,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.331
my first customer of the day,
on her way home.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.567
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane...

08:55.320 --> 08:59.609
Turn left onto Ragman Lane,
where I do most of my trade.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.969
Lanna is very impressive.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.804
Very industrious.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.285
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.485
How will she serve him?

09:09.560 --> 09:12.325
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.730
She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.006
What will she do there?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.725
She will see.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.487
See what?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.566
How can a man tell a girl this?

09:24.640 --> 09:27.928
If he knew what she would see,
there would be no reason to send her.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.006
Oysters, clams and cockles!

09:48.440 --> 09:51.364
Oysters, clams and cockles!

09:59.280 --> 10:01.601
Oysters, clams and cockles!

10:02.680 --> 10:04.284
Your oysters fresh?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.521
Best in the city.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.489
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

10:22.680 --> 10:23.727
Mmm.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.242
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.120
It's my 18th voyage.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.769
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.570
Can't do it.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.403
Please, I've three children.
Without me...

10:49.040 --> 10:52.249
Here, take it. You have to.
I've three children.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.651
- What will they do?
- Come on.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.484
They've nothing without me.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.210
Please, you have to!

10:57.280 --> 10:59.487
Please, you don't understand!

11:07.720 --> 11:09.643
The man is a gambler.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.521
He wagers that a sailor's ship
will make it to its destination.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.371
It is a strange wager for the captain.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.522
He only wins if he loses his life.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.851
So why would a captain
make the wager in the first place?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.609
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.248
If the captain dies,

11:35.320 --> 11:37.322
the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.844
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

11:42.920 --> 11:45.082
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.122
A destitute woman and her small child,
what can they do to such a man

11:49.200 --> 11:51.726
if he keeps their money for himself?

11:53.560 --> 11:56.040
To whom can they turn for recourse?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.491
The Many-Faced God.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.762
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.481
A man had no idea what a girl would see
and what she would not.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.409
A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.891
She will watch the gambler.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.123
She will come to know as much about him
as she knows about herself.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.440
And then what?

12:23.440 --> 12:26.922
A gift for the thin man.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.645
She's not ready.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.041
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.845
And if she's not?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.684
It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.562
The trial will take place soon.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.841
The High Sparrow will be presenting
a substantial case against you.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.001
The charges?

13:28.080 --> 13:31.926
Fornication, treason, incest,
the murder of King Robert.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.647
- All lies.
- Of course.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.406
My concern is that the Faith does not adhere

13:43.480 --> 13:47.166
to the same standards of proof as the crown.

13:47.240 --> 13:51.689
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,
but belief is so often the death of reason.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.808
I wish you had said it sooner.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.691
Is there any word from Jaime?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.004
No, I'm afraid not.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.484
Grand Maester Pycelle

14:10.840 --> 14:14.208
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

14:14.280 --> 14:15.930
to serve as Hand of the King.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.566
He now presides over the Small Council.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.368
Tell him I need to speak to him.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.727
I implored him to visit you,
but he would not.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.129
What about my son, the king?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.368
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

14:34.440 --> 14:36.727
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest...

14:36.800 --> 14:38.211
The king has not taken them well.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.045
He remains in his chambers.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.249
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.570
You need to talk to him.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.722
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

14:47.800 --> 14:48.961
come and see his mother.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.726
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.529
He won't see anyone.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.290
I can't stay here.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.606
There is a way.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.960
A way out.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.601
Confess?

15:12.800 --> 15:15.201
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.090
I made him.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.249
I rose him up from nothing.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.005
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

15:24.080 --> 15:25.730
and beg his forgiveness.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.363
Good bye.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.521
The work continues.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.240
Why?

16:18.480 --> 16:19.891
Why, Theon?

16:20.120 --> 16:23.249
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.651
- Reek.
- Reek.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.007
Why did you tell him, Reek?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.090
I was helping you.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.045
You wanted to escape.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.770
There is no escape.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.366
Not ever.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.602
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.924
The master knew.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.445
He knows everything.

16:46.520 --> 16:50.445
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

16:51.640 --> 16:55.611
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.525
Good.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.969
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.690
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

17:10.800 --> 17:13.963
right here, right now, I would.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.483
I deserved everything.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.483
I deserve to be Reek.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.809
I did terrible things.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.645
Turned on Robb.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.289
Captured Winterfell.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.762
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

17:37.840 --> 17:40.127
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.725
You'd known them since they were born.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.211
They weren't. They were only...

17:43.280 --> 17:44.327
Only what?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.046
- I can't.
- Tell me.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.565
I can't, not unless the master says.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.801
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

17:49.920 --> 17:54.289
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.409
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

17:57.480 --> 17:59.005
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

18:01.480 --> 18:02.970
I couldn't find them.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.690
It was two farm boys.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.800
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.880
You didn't...

18:26.840 --> 18:28.604
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

18:28.680 --> 18:29.647
I can't talk to you anymore.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.121
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

18:32.200 --> 18:34.362
Not Theon! Reek!

18:39.760 --> 18:43.162
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.163
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.481
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

18:48.400 --> 18:52.405
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.691
We have enough food for six months.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.809
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

18:59.920 --> 19:05.245
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.651
You disagree?

19:09.720 --> 19:13.202
Stannis isn't from the North.
You are, Father.

19:14.040 --> 19:17.169
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

19:17.240 --> 19:19.971
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.166
And what do you recommend?

19:21.240 --> 19:22.924
That we not sit and wait
for Stannis to decide

19:23.000 --> 19:25.128
what sort of fight this is going to be.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.330
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.483
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.164
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.924
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.083
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.009
I don't need an army.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.968
I need 20 good men.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.884
So, have you decided yet?

19:55.960 --> 19:58.122
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

20:00.720 --> 20:03.883
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.883
It's probably my safest option.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.803
I could see why you would think so.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.284
It's what your father would have done.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.845
And what would your father have done?

20:18.200 --> 20:22.091
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

20:22.560 --> 20:25.609
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.806
Is that why you killed him?

20:30.480 --> 20:33.290
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

20:33.760 --> 20:36.047
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.521
And on that day, should it ever come,

20:39.480 --> 20:41.448
we'll need more wine than this.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.251
I know what my father was.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.805
What he did.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.882
I know the Mad King earned his name.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.407
So, here we sit.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.851
Two terrible children of
two terrible fathers.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.610
I'm terrible?

21:01.680 --> 21:03.011
I've heard stories.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.205
Why did you travel to the
far side of the world

21:05.280 --> 21:07.089
to meet someone terrible?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.123
To see if you were the
right kind of terrible.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.281
Which kind is that?

21:10.360 --> 21:13.330
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.048
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.930
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.843
Yes, that was wise.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.083
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.241
Very impressive.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.845
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

21:30.920 --> 21:32.081
though not by choice,

21:32.160 --> 21:35.289
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.771
She ended up having him killed.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.201
Perhaps it won't come to that.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.729
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.810
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.406
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.276
He was my traveling companion,

22:00.376 --> 22:02.486
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.688
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.083
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.845
He did what he had to do to survive.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.003
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.721
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.121
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.090
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.490
Except my brother.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.848
The brother who killed my father?

22:30.480 --> 22:31.561
That's the one.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.529
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.125
Your queenly prerogative.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.770
I had given up on life

22:40.440 --> 22:43.284
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.050
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.409
I'm not going to kill you.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.006
No?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.483
- Banish me?
- No.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.010
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

23:06.080 --> 23:07.605
You're going to advise me.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.727
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.646
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.490
The Iron Throne.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.248
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.926
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.002
I'm not entirely joking.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.845
There's more to the world than Westeros.

23:31.920 --> 23:36.050
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

23:36.120 --> 23:39.602
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.731
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

23:44.800 --> 23:47.849
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.810
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.324
But this is not my home.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.131
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

23:56.200 --> 23:57.690
The common people.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.411
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.608
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

24:02.680 --> 24:04.921
and only the common people.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.047
What was that like?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.609
Ruling without the rich?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.482
House Targaryen is gone.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.484
Not a single person who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.283
The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.081
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.761
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.049
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.963
That leaves the Tyrells.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.411
Not impossible.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.641
Not enough.

24:32.720 --> 24:36.202
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.282
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.203
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

24:41.280 --> 24:45.524
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.571
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.251
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.242
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.042
I'm going to break the wheel.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.611
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.966
I won.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.521
You struck me.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.887
Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.168
But I'm the best you've got.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.249
If I win at the Great Pit,

25:37.120 --> 25:38.804
how much can you sell me for?

25:41.800 --> 25:44.883
You're a free man.
You could have gone anywhere.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.205
Why did you come back?

25:52.120 --> 25:55.727
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.125
Thirsty?

26:04.640 --> 26:05.846
Confess.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.003
I'll get out of here before long.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.081
Confess.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.481
I can make you a wealthy woman.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.245
A lady of the court.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.685
Confess.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.245
Or I can make sure you die
in the most hideous way imaginable.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.962
And all I do is sit here
imagining hideous ways for you to die.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.410
Does it hurt?

27:23.200 --> 27:24.486
No.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.561
Good.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.090
How are you?

27:33.080 --> 27:36.448
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.405
You know what I mean.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.246
I'm good.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.281
Are you scared?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.764
- A little.
- Me, too.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.364
- Who's there?
- Olly.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.081
Ch.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.046
Come in.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.770
I heard what happened.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.610
Oh, not to worry.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.923
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.010
Figured you were hungry.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.370
Oh, you're a good lad.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.082
Wanted to ask you something
if you've got the time.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.443
I need to check on baby Sam.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.044
Now then, how can I help?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.768
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

28:38.840 --> 28:42.049
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.406
Wildlings killed my mum and dad.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.449
- They killed everyone in my village.
- We've been fighting them for years.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.204
This wasn't a fight.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.044
We were farmers.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.645
They slaughtered us.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.525
So why is he saving them?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.122
Wildlings are people.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.605
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

29:04.720 --> 29:08.042
The one he's traveling with,
with the red beard,

29:08.120 --> 29:10.600
he led the raid on my village.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.330
- Oh, Olly...
- How can he trust him?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.531
I've seen the army of the dead.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.887
I've seen the White Walkers.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.930
And they're coming for us,
for all the living.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.683
And when it's time,

29:27.840 --> 29:30.525
we'll need every last man we can find.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.771
But what if we let the wildlings
through the gates

29:33.840 --> 29:35.649
and they cut our throats while we sleep?

29:35.720 --> 29:38.530
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.841
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.769
Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices,

29:44.840 --> 29:46.683
choices that might look wrong to others,

29:46.760 --> 29:49.525
but you know are right in the long run.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.450
You believe that?

29:51.560 --> 29:53.369
With all my heart.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.328
Try not to worry.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.687
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.285
He always comes back.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.445
Watch your bow!

31:24.160 --> 31:26.049
You trust me, Jon Snow?

31:27.200 --> 31:29.362
Does that make me a fool?

31:29.440 --> 31:31.488
We're fools together now.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.245
Lord of Bones.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.168
Been a long time.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.124
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.567
The other way around now. What happened?

31:59.040 --> 32:00.246
War.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.926
You call that a war?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.287
The greatest army the North has ever seen

32:05.400 --> 32:08.290
cut to pieces by some southern king.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.089
We should gather the elders,

32:10.680 --> 32:12.523
find somewhere quiet to talk.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.250
You don't give the orders here.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.288
I'm not giving an order.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.850
Why aren't you in chains?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.610
He's not my prisoner.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.805
No?

32:24.920 --> 32:26.445
What is he?

32:26.520 --> 32:28.090
We're allies.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.241
You fucking traitor.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.727
You fight for the crows now?

32:39.640 --> 32:42.041
I don't fight for the crows.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.962
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.407
Is that right?

32:49.480 --> 32:52.962
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

32:53.040 --> 32:54.929
And when you're done talking,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.685
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

33:13.240 --> 33:16.164
Gather the elders, and let's talk.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.124
My name's Jon Snow.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.328
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.484
We're not friends.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.163
We've never been friends.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.447
We won't become friends today.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.883
This isn't about friendship.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.049
This is about survival.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.009
This is about putting a 700-foot wall

34:09.080 --> 34:11.208
between you and what's out there.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.408
You built that wall to keep us out.

34:13.480 --> 34:16.404
Since when do the crows give two shits
if we live?

34:16.480 --> 34:19.563
In normal times we wouldn't,
but these aren't normal times.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.882
The White Walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.089
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.288
But together, we can beat them.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.000
Beat the White Walkers?

34:30.560 --> 34:33.166
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.844
It's not a trick.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.844
It's a gift, for those who join us.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.365
Dragonglass.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.484
A man of the Night's Watch

35:00.560 --> 35:03.245
used one of these daggers to kill a Walker.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.810
- You saw this?
- No.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.925
But I trust the man.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.520
There are old stories about dragonglass.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.201
There are old stories
about ice spiders big as hounds.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.482
And with the things we've seen,
you don't believe them?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.207
Come with me
and I'll share these weapons.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.805
Come with you where?

35:20.880 --> 35:22.644
There are good lands south of the wall.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.449
The Night's Watch
will let you through the tunnel

35:24.520 --> 35:26.921
and allow your people to farm those lands.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.048
I knew Mance Rayder.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.090
He never wanted a war
with the Night's Watch.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.766
He wanted a new life for his people,
for you.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.286
We're prepared to give you that new life.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.687
If?

35:40.760 --> 35:43.730
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.241
Where is Mance?

35:51.920 --> 35:53.922
- He died.
- How?

35:59.680 --> 36:00.966
I put an arrow through his heart.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.966
Hey.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.929
Hey.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.571
Hey.

36:09.640 --> 36:13.042
I say we send the Lord Commander
back to Castle Black.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.531
With no eyes.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.081
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.045
I did.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.329
The southern king,
who broke our army, Stannis,

36:24.400 --> 36:27.210
wanted to burn him alive to
send us a message.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.726
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.169
His arrow was mercy.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.770
What he did took courage.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.370
And that's what we need today,

36:37.440 --> 36:41.968
the courage to make peace
with men we've been killing for generations.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.929
I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.809
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.282
I'll never forget mine.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.926
I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance
attacked the wall.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.731
But I'm asking you

37:01.920 --> 37:03.684
to think about your children now.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.321
They'll never have children of their own
if we don't band together.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.687
The Long Night is coming,

37:12.760 --> 37:14.603
and the dead come with it.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.368
No clan can stop them.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.090
The free folk can't stop them.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.525
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.968
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.161
Only together...

37:26.680 --> 37:27.920
All of us.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.411
And even then, it may not be enough.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.165
But at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.364
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.644
He's prettier than both my daughters,

37:56.040 --> 37:57.963
but he knows how to fight.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.646
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.803
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.528
He came because he needs us.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.201
And we need him.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.162
My ancestors would spit on me
if I broke bread with a crow.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.771
So would mine, but fuck 'em. They're dead.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.091
I'll never trust a man in black.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.160
But I trust you, Tormund.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.328
If you say this is the way,

38:42.960 --> 38:44.530
we're with you.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.451
This is the way.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.243
I'm with Tormund.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.522
We stay here, we're dead men.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.324
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.002
Tormund.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.844
Keep that new life you want to give us.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.201
And keep your glass, King Crow.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.209
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats,

39:23.280 --> 39:26.602
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.010
That's our enemy.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.087
That has always been our enemy.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.650
I fucking hate Thenns.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.841
- Move it.
- Be careful.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.049
- Move 'em along, now.
- We'll catch the tides.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.169
That's it, come on!

40:21.000 --> 40:23.480
How many are with us? Five thousand?

40:23.920 --> 40:25.365
I'm not good at counting.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.370
We're leaving too many behind.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.771
The free folk are stubborn.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.650
You know how long it took Mance
to band them together?

40:32.720 --> 40:34.961
Twenty fucking years.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.361
And he knew them better than I ever will.

40:38.480 --> 40:42.405
They're running out of food,
and there's nothing to hunt.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.010
They'll come around.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.889
- Get yourselves ready.
- Aye!

40:49.360 --> 40:51.124
Johnna is gonna look after you.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.806
She's in charge. You listen to her.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.520
Take her.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.120
I want to go with you.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.885
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.923
I'm right behind you. I promise.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.201
Go on.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.721
Another one.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.641
Keep moving.
We'll meet you out there.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.611
Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.843
- That's the last one!
- Three more! Move on!

41:25.320 --> 41:27.448
There's more
dragonglass everywhere.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.247
I've got some more daggers
over here.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.769
Put that dagger in his bag.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.761
Uh...

41:44.920 --> 41:46.922
The fuck you looking at?

42:36.520 --> 42:38.284
Steady!

42:58.440 --> 42:59.930
Shut the gate.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.684
Shut the gate!

43:06.080 --> 43:07.684
Shut the gate!

43:13.600 --> 43:15.682
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

43:31.640 --> 43:33.688
Open the gate!

44:19.520 --> 44:22.091
Ready your arrows!

44:40.880 --> 44:44.043
- Wait!
- Keep in line! Get in line!

44:44.680 --> 44:46.250
Get in line!

45:46.680 --> 45:48.489
Get to the front!

45:49.320 --> 45:50.970
Go on, shoot it!

45:58.080 --> 46:01.368
- Wait!
- Duncan, hold the line!

46:07.000 --> 46:08.206
Lord Commander!

46:08.320 --> 46:10.641
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

46:10.800 --> 46:12.643
- But you'll never make...
- Now!

46:15.960 --> 46:18.327
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

46:18.400 --> 46:20.209
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

46:21.600 --> 46:23.170
You should be on one of those boats.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.164
So should you. My little girls got on.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.402
They're gonna let them pass the Wall
even if you're not there?

46:28.480 --> 46:30.847
You have my word. I've given orders.

46:31.240 --> 46:34.403
Don't think you're gonna be there
to enforce those orders.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.207
If they get through, everyone dies!

46:41.880 --> 46:43.530
Night's Watch!

46:43.600 --> 46:46.683
With me! Move!

46:48.480 --> 46:49.811
Move!

47:55.120 --> 47:56.121
No!

48:06.360 --> 48:08.761
- Tormund, the sleigh!
- Okay!

48:57.840 --> 48:59.330
The dragonglass.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.640
You and me, then!

49:01.920 --> 49:03.046
Go!

50:13.480 --> 50:14.481
Get the glass.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.165
Come on!

53:23.240 --> 53:25.368
- The dragonglass.
- Fuck the glass!

53:25.440 --> 53:27.010
We are gonna die here!

53:58.320 --> 54:00.004
Oh, fuck!

54:06.800 --> 54:08.086
Here they come!

54:17.920 --> 54:19.490
Wun Wun, to the sea!

55:02.080 --> 55:04.765
In the boats! Quickly!

55:04.880 --> 55:07.087
- Faster, faster!
- Run!

55:07.240 --> 55:08.651
Quickly!

55:10.840 --> 55:13.889
- Go! Row!
- Go, come on!

55:43.520 --> 55:45.761
Let's go! Now!
