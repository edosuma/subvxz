01:26.500 --> 01:27.472
Hello.

01:27.472 --> 01:29.935
Have you made your selection?

01:29.935 --> 01:32.820
Yeah, yeah. It's all set, just like we discussed.

01:32.820 --> 01:35.240
We'll be expecting you.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.848
And, uh... and the money?
Same as last time, right?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.243
The same.

01:39.243 --> 01:41.361
Be careful with the sedative.

01:41.361 --> 01:43.347
You nearly killed the last one.

01:43.347 --> 01:46.006
100 milligrams. Don't worry.
I'll get it right.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.625
We'll be expecting you.

01:53.406 --> 01:57.790
It's been a long road

01:57.790 --> 02:01.012
Getting from there to here

02:01.012 --> 02:04.795
It's been a long time

02:04.795 --> 02:08.743
But my time is finally near

02:08.743 --> 02:13.038
And I will see my dream come alive at last

02:13.038 --> 02:16.575
I will touch the sky

02:16.575 --> 02:20.449
And they're not gonna hold me down no more

02:20.449 --> 02:23.637
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:23.637 --> 02:28.324
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:28.324 --> 02:31.309
I'm going where the heart will take me

02:31.309 --> 02:36.288
I've got faith to believe

02:36.288 --> 02:38.940
I can do anything

02:38.940 --> 02:43.770
I've got strength of the soul

02:43.770 --> 02:46.733
No one's gonna bend or break me

02:46.733 --> 02:52.575
I can reach any star

02:52.575 --> 02:56.331
I've got faith

02:56.331 --> 03:00.300
I've got faith

03:00.300 --> 03:02.764
Faith of the heart

03:13.511 --> 03:16.746
063 [3x11] Carpenter Street

03:30.698 --> 03:32.729
Looking for a date, honey?

03:32.729 --> 03:36.707
Maybe with your friend.

03:36.707 --> 03:39.739
You don't know what you're missing.

03:47.202 --> 03:51.226
Ooh! What can I do for you, sweetheart?

03:51.226 --> 03:52.918
Hey, I know you.

03:52.918 --> 03:54.424
From this morning.

03:54.424 --> 03:56.120
You brought me the apple juice.

03:56.120 --> 03:56.937
What?

03:56.937 --> 03:59.004
At the clinic.

03:59.004 --> 04:00.713
Oh, yeah.

04:00.713 --> 04:02.720
Now I remember.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.091
Small world, huh?

04:05.091 --> 04:06.264
Want me to get in?

04:06.264 --> 04:08.132
Sure. Yeah.

04:20.570 --> 04:23.572
There's a nice place to park right in the neighborhood.

04:23.572 --> 04:26.786
Turn left at the next light.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.807
Georgia Tandy.
0-negative.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.024
How the hell would you remember that?

04:41.343 --> 04:45.611
Uh... It's another two blocks.

04:46.302 --> 04:50.102
If that's drugs, I am not interested.

04:51.113 --> 04:52.950
What you got in there?

04:52.950 --> 04:54.821
Come here.

05:01.081 --> 05:04.449
There you go.
There you go.

05:24.549 --> 05:26.687
It's okay.

05:26.687 --> 05:29.279
They said they won't hurt you.

05:44.459 --> 05:45.613
Yes?

05:45.613 --> 05:48.258
Loomis.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.802
There you go... nice and comfy.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.204
Good boy.

08:03.457 --> 08:05.753
Cheese?

08:12.509 --> 08:14.228
This is your last piece.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.412
It's okay.

08:16.940 --> 08:20.670
How have you been, Jonathan?

08:20.670 --> 08:23.940
About time you showed up.

08:23.940 --> 08:26.234
Our mission's changed quite a bit
since the last time I saw you,

08:26.234 --> 08:28.392
but I suppose you're aware of it.

08:28.392 --> 08:30.107
I am.

08:30.107 --> 08:33.794
Maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me.

08:33.794 --> 08:37.022
The Xindi weapon would be a good place to start.

08:37.022 --> 08:39.035
We don't know any more than you do.

08:39.035 --> 08:44.424
I thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping an eye on the timeline.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.460
You're from the 30th century.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.893
Hasn't all this happened already?

08:47.893 --> 08:52.257
History doesn't mention anything about a conflict between humans and Xindi.

08:52.257 --> 08:53.340
How could that be?

08:53.340 --> 08:56.282
The events that are taking place are the result of temporal incursions.

08:56.282 --> 08:57.665
They're not supposed to be happening.

08:57.665 --> 08:58.764
But they are happening.

08:58.764 --> 09:02.613
Yes, they are, but the outcome hasn't reached us yet.

09:02.613 --> 09:05.240
It takes a while for changes to ripple through the timeline.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.439
The time traveler... the man the Suliban work for...

09:08.439 --> 09:10.475
What about him?

09:10.475 --> 09:13.466
He's the one who told us about the weapon being built.

09:13.466 --> 09:14.914
Should I believe him?

09:14.914 --> 09:16.465
You have no reason not to.

09:16.465 --> 09:20.284
You said I'm supposed to play some crucial part in history.

09:20.284 --> 09:21.931
Does this have something to do with it?

09:21.931 --> 09:24.974
I wish I could say that it does, but I don't know.

09:24.974 --> 09:27.129
I told you, none of this was supposed to happen.

09:27.129 --> 09:30.552
You're not being very helpful!

09:32.362 --> 09:34.001
Why are you here?

09:34.001 --> 09:37.097
We've detected three Xindi where they're not supposed to be.

09:37.097 --> 09:39.620
This Expanse is filled with Xindi.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.810
I'm not talking about the Expanse.

09:41.810 --> 09:46.491
I'm talking about Detroit, Michigan, 150 years ago.

09:59.716 --> 10:02.089
Sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait.

10:02.089 --> 10:03.621
Come in.

10:12.138 --> 10:17.143
I just had a visit from Daniels.

10:17.143 --> 10:21.574
I think all your doubts about time travel are about to go out the window.

10:21.574 --> 10:23.464
Meaning?

10:23.464 --> 10:31.603
Daniels and his team have discovered three Reptilians on Earth in the early 21st century.

10:31.603 --> 10:34.760
He wants to send us back to find out what they're doing.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.623
Us?

10:35.623 --> 10:38.690
He told me I could bring one person. No more.

10:38.690 --> 10:44.603
If Daniels is the time traveler he claims to be,
why doesn't he find out for himself?

10:44.603 --> 10:47.455
It took him a long while for him to get permission to interact with me.

10:47.455 --> 10:49.667
There are clearances.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.106
He said it would take too much time.

10:52.106 --> 10:54.962
I would think he would have all the time in the world.

10:54.962 --> 10:59.684
He said the three Xindi traveled to Earth from our century.

10:59.684 --> 11:03.473
They've been there for two months.

11:03.473 --> 11:06.058
They're not sightseeing, T'Pol.

11:06.058 --> 11:07.932
We have to find out what they're up to.

11:07.932 --> 11:10.697
How are we supposed to accomplish this?

11:10.697 --> 11:15.371
He wants us to meet him in the Command Center at 0800 tomorrow.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.439
Come on, boy.

11:21.106 --> 11:22.763
Check the database.

11:22.763 --> 11:26.247
Find something to wear that won't stand out in 2004.

11:33.203 --> 11:36.641
Last time Daniels sent you to another century,
you had one hell of a time getting back.

11:36.641 --> 11:37.803
He gave me this.

11:37.803 --> 11:40.723
Said he'd return us whenever we signaled him.

11:40.723 --> 11:42.618
These are temporal tags.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.909
We can use them to bring back anything
that doesn't belong there.

11:45.909 --> 11:47.883
If anybody asks where you went,
what should I tell them?

11:47.883 --> 11:52.188
With both shuttlepods in the bay,
it'll be hard to explain.

11:52.188 --> 11:54.639
I'm sure you'll think of something.

11:54.639 --> 11:55.819
Try to stay out of trouble.

11:55.819 --> 11:57.303
You, too.

11:57.303 --> 11:59.486
Here's the duty roster.

12:10.673 --> 12:12.790
We just traveled 90 light years back to Earth?

12:12.790 --> 12:16.770
And 150 years into the past.

12:17.662 --> 12:22.026
Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced.

12:22.026 --> 12:23.860
You will be.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.555
Come on.

12:34.228 --> 12:38.832
This one has a motion-activated security system.

12:40.654 --> 12:42.536
This one, too.

12:53.813 --> 12:55.766
We're in.

12:56.959 --> 13:05.418
This apparatus... it appears to have been designed to incapacitate the vehicle.

14:06.528 --> 14:10.245
Have you ever operated a vehicle from this period?

14:10.245 --> 14:12.622
I can pilot a starship.

14:18.180 --> 14:20.931
"R, N, D, two, three, four."

14:20.931 --> 14:23.863
I suggest you begin with two.

14:28.812 --> 14:30.421
Foot controls.

14:45.734 --> 14:49.647
I don't believe you've activated your external lighting.

14:56.548 --> 14:58.740
What year is that map from?

14:58.740 --> 15:03.110
2002. It's the closest I could find in the Starfleet database.

15:03.110 --> 15:06.924
The layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years.

15:06.924 --> 15:09.251
Turn starboard on 24th Street.

15:09.251 --> 15:12.977
If that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometers,

15:12.977 --> 15:16.130
how far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city?

15:16.130 --> 15:20.635
I've created a search-grid that requires a journey of approximately 80 kilometers.

15:20.635 --> 15:25.044
But it's probable we'll find them before we complete it.

15:35.527 --> 15:37.459
What's that icon?

15:37.459 --> 15:38.976
It's a gasoline pump.

15:38.976 --> 15:40.682
We need to get fuel.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.052
Where?

15:42.052 --> 15:44.501
Where isn't the problem.

15:44.501 --> 15:46.998
We're going to need money... U.S. currency.

15:46.998 --> 15:51.468
That's going to be difficult at this time of night.

15:51.468 --> 15:53.467
Not necessarily.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.734
People used to go to jail for this.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.988
We'll return what we don't use.

16:41.390 --> 16:42.084
Yeah?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.567
Are you Lawrence Strode?

16:43.567 --> 16:44.412
Who are you?

16:44.412 --> 16:46.856
I'm from the blood bank.
We had a screw-up this afternoon.

16:46.856 --> 16:48.536
We gave you the wrong papers to sign.

16:48.536 --> 16:49.758
I'm not giving the money back.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.158
No, no, no, they don't want the money back.

16:52.158 --> 16:53.997
In fact, they're going to pay you again.

16:53.997 --> 16:55.663
25 bucks.

16:55.663 --> 16:58.061
They just need you to sign the right papers.

16:58.061 --> 16:58.700
Did you bring 'em?

16:58.700 --> 17:01.755
No, no, they wouldn't let me.
You gotta do it in front of the supervisor.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.213
You know, the fat broad who paid you.

17:04.213 --> 17:06.207
They sent me to drive you down.

17:06.207 --> 17:08.021
- It's 11:00 at night.
- Yeah, I know.

17:08.021 --> 17:10.130
They want to send your blood work out first thing in the morning

17:10.130 --> 17:13.489
and they can't do it without the right paperwork.

17:14.886 --> 17:19.631
You want the 25 bucks or not?

17:27.136 --> 17:28.834
This gonna take long?

17:28.834 --> 17:31.900
I don't wanna miss Conan.

17:31.900 --> 17:36.738
Were they aware at this time that Earth's supply of fossil fuel was nearing depletion?

17:36.738 --> 17:39.241
They had been for 30 years.

17:39.241 --> 17:42.917
But it wasn't until 2061 that they finally...

17:43.511 --> 17:45.767
One kilometer, straight ahead.

18:09.582 --> 18:11.609
The second structure from the left.

18:11.609 --> 18:13.277
Three Xindi bio-signs.

18:13.277 --> 18:15.026
Any humans?

18:15.026 --> 18:18.536
Five, in another part of the building.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.089
This doesn't look very residential.

18:25.394 --> 18:27.798
Set your phase-pistol to kill.

18:27.798 --> 18:32.005
When the Reptilians boarded Enterprise, stun had no effect.

18:35.504 --> 18:36.983
See what you can find out.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.525
I'll look over there.

18:42.005 --> 18:43.076
Go ahead.

18:43.076 --> 18:46.100
There's a neutronic power source coming from the first floor.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.939
I found a gate with an electric locking mechanism.

18:50.966 --> 18:54.172
We shouldn't have a problem.

18:58.335 --> 19:00.126
Do you see the vehicle?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.875
I see it.

19:14.037 --> 19:15.122
Yes?

19:15.122 --> 19:16.926
Loomis.

19:37.446 --> 19:40.656
Did you disinfect your hands?

19:40.656 --> 19:43.114
I insert I.V.s all day.
I told you that.

19:43.114 --> 19:48.538
If there are any infections here,
it won't be because of me.

19:48.538 --> 19:49.955
You forget something?

19:49.955 --> 19:55.267
We have decided to compensate you for the final three patients in one payment.

19:55.267 --> 19:57.465
Well, that's not what we agreed.

19:57.465 --> 19:59.266
You said I'd get paid for each one.

19:59.266 --> 20:04.177
Bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated.

20:04.177 --> 20:08.065
We should wait a while.. a few more days, at least.

20:08.065 --> 20:09.807
There was something on the news.

20:09.807 --> 20:12.458
Cops are starting to get complaints that people have gone missing.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.057
We can't wait a few more days!

20:15.057 --> 20:17.522
We need the last two.

20:17.522 --> 20:20.246
Look as soon they figure out that
all these people here have been to the clinic,

20:20.246 --> 20:22.815
it won't take a rocket scientist to point the finger at me.

20:22.815 --> 20:25.660
Then I suggest you finish your work quickly.

20:25.660 --> 20:29.165
Look, I don't know what you guys are up to,
and I don't want to know.

20:29.165 --> 20:31.396
It's not my business.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.332
But the cops don't take kindly to people who help terrorists.

20:34.332 --> 20:36.168
I gotta be real careful.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.938
We will double your fee for the final three.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.573
But the last two must here by tomorrow.

20:42.573 --> 20:47.053
Double?

20:47.053 --> 20:48.622
Tomorrow.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.411
Yeah, all right.

20:51.411 --> 20:53.562
I'll have them here by tomorrow.

21:03.881 --> 21:05.871
Here he comes.

22:05.749 --> 22:13.704
Ninth floor... 280 pounds.

22:15.133 --> 22:18.277
William Meyers.

22:18.277 --> 22:20.808
Second floor.

23:15.410 --> 23:18.014
And the man in the wheelchair?

23:18.014 --> 23:21.447
Why were you bringing him to an abandoned factory in the middle of the night?

23:21.447 --> 23:24.649
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about.

23:24.649 --> 23:26.248
What's this?

23:28.799 --> 23:31.384
I took it from the clinic.

23:31.384 --> 23:33.975
I work at the blood bank on Porter Street.

23:33.975 --> 23:36.146
Check with them, they'll tell you.
I've been there for over a year.

23:36.146 --> 23:39.393
- Why would you take it?
- Make a few extra bucks.

23:39.393 --> 23:41.880
There's plenty of people on the street looking for that stuff.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.792
Really?

23:43.792 --> 23:48.925
Why would anyone "on the street" be interested in acquiring methohezital?

23:48.925 --> 23:51.982
Do you make a habit of climbing out your window
when someone knocks on the door?

23:51.982 --> 23:56.501
I don't like cops.

23:56.501 --> 23:58.738
Tell us about your friends on Carpenter Street.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.689
Never been to Carpenter Street.

24:01.308 --> 24:04.461
You were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair.

24:04.461 --> 24:06.498
Now, tell me who's inside that factory.

24:06.498 --> 24:09.056
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about.

24:09.056 --> 24:12.054
I think it's time you find me a lawyer.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.946
Untie him.

24:16.946 --> 24:18.652
You heard him.

24:18.652 --> 24:20.677
Untie me.

24:30.534 --> 24:32.670
That's better.

24:41.762 --> 24:45.255
I didn't feel right doing that with you tied up.

24:45.255 --> 24:47.560
Carpenter Street.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.134
You're not allowed to hit me.

24:49.134 --> 24:50.397
Untie him again.

24:50.397 --> 24:54.592
No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I don't know who he is. I swear to God.

24:54.592 --> 24:55.972
A doctor, maybe.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.049
Says he's working on a vaccine. Experimental.

24:58.049 --> 25:02.318
He doesn't have approval, or something like that,
so he needed me to bring him people.

25:02.318 --> 25:04.964
Does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research

25:04.964 --> 25:08.075
is being conducted in an abandoned factory?

25:08.075 --> 25:09.702
I thought about that.

25:09.702 --> 25:12.895
Just tonight, I thought maybe he's some kind of a terrorist.

25:12.895 --> 25:17.784
But I swear, if I knew that for a fact, I never would've agreed to help him.

25:17.784 --> 25:22.405
In one individual, we've managed to find the worst qualities of this era...

25:22.405 --> 25:27.142
greed, violence, moral corruption.

25:27.142 --> 25:30.212
But he said he wasn't going to hurt anybody.

25:30.212 --> 25:31.881
I just saw them an hour ago.

25:31.881 --> 25:33.082
They were all okay.

25:33.082 --> 25:34.173
How many?

25:34.173 --> 25:35.384
Five.

25:35.384 --> 25:38.763
No, no, six.
The wheelchair guy was number six.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.726
How did this doctor find you?

25:40.726 --> 25:43.250
I told you, I work at the blood bank.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.123
He wanted someone from every blood type.

25:45.123 --> 25:47.597
Eight blood types, eight people.

25:47.597 --> 25:51.801
He figured I had access to that kind of information.

25:53.360 --> 26:00.843
Did he also "figure" that you'd have no compunctions about abducting people?

26:00.843 --> 26:02.725
What's he paying you?

26:02.725 --> 26:04.224
$5,000 apiece.

26:04.224 --> 26:06.248
Double for the last three.

26:06.248 --> 26:10.515
Is that what human life is worth in the 21st century?

26:10.515 --> 26:14.265
I told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them.

26:14.265 --> 26:16.580
What does he look like?

26:16.580 --> 26:17.672
He only calls me on the phone.

26:17.672 --> 26:21.451
I saw him a couple of times, but he stays in the shadows.

26:21.451 --> 26:24.970
You know, he's kind of tall, that's all I can tell you.

26:24.970 --> 26:26.985
Why don't you let me go?

26:26.985 --> 26:30.125
I swear to you, I will never do it again.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.958
You are going to do it again.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.636
That is, if you have any hope of staying out of prison.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.612
What're you talking about?

26:36.612 --> 26:37.405
These two files.

26:37.405 --> 26:39.726
AB-positive and B-negative... they're the final two?

26:39.726 --> 26:41.168
Yeah.

26:41.168 --> 26:46.333
Well, you're looking at your last victim.

26:46.333 --> 26:50.306
A healthy male with B-negative blood.

26:55.303 --> 26:59.044
If you think you're going to be in there a long time
we should get something to eat first.

26:59.044 --> 26:59.884
Be quiet.

26:59.884 --> 27:02.762
Come on, I'm not talking about anything fancy.

27:02.762 --> 27:07.152
A burger, a taco.

27:07.152 --> 27:10.812
There's a drive-thru less than a mile from here.

27:10.812 --> 27:13.699
Cops have to eat, don't they?

27:13.699 --> 27:15.861
What is the matter with you two?
I'll pay.

27:15.861 --> 27:18.279
I told you to be quiet.

27:21.787 --> 27:24.667
Which side of the street is it on?

27:26.255 --> 27:28.641
Welcome to Burgerland.
How may we serve you today?

27:28.641 --> 27:33.013
I'll have the Double Superbeef, no lettuce.

27:33.013 --> 27:36.519
One Double Superbeef without lettuce, please.

27:36.519 --> 27:38.883
You can make that a triple for only 40 cents.

27:38.883 --> 27:40.906
Do it.

27:42.014 --> 27:43.836
A double will be fine.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.263
Would you like to make that a combo?

27:45.263 --> 27:47.529
Yeah. Fries and a medium root beer.

27:47.529 --> 27:51.900
Will there be anything else today?

27:52.728 --> 27:54.774
A hamburger, ketchup only.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.818
You can make that a double for only 40 cents extra.

27:57.818 --> 27:58.822
No, thank you.

27:58.822 --> 28:00.442
Would you like to make that a combo?

28:00.442 --> 28:02.405
No, no combo.

28:02.405 --> 28:04.583
Will there be anything else today?

28:08.538 --> 28:11.669
Does the "Fiesta Salad" contain animal products?

28:11.669 --> 28:17.053
No, but we can add three strips of bacon for only 75 cents.

28:17.053 --> 28:18.331
Nothing for me, thank you.

28:18.331 --> 28:20.842
- You sure?
- Quite.

28:31.932 --> 28:33.809
You guys don't mind, do you?

28:33.809 --> 28:36.144
I'm starving.

28:36.144 --> 28:38.785
You know, it would make it a lot easier
if you untied my hands.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.778
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

28:40.778 --> 28:43.447
Do the best you can.

28:46.623 --> 28:48.517
I told you.

28:49.169 --> 28:52.902
Let me get that for you.
Oh, boy.

28:59.923 --> 29:01.876
You're a veggie, I forgot.

29:01.876 --> 29:05.779
Why don't you take a fry?
They're probably okay.

29:08.358 --> 29:10.967
Have it your way.

30:03.070 --> 30:07.116
They'll come in to take fresh blood samples every hour,

30:07.116 --> 30:11.453
and they re-administer the sedative every six hours.

30:11.453 --> 30:14.990
I recommend you do whatever
you're going to do before then.

30:19.586 --> 30:20.959
Number seven.

30:20.959 --> 30:22.850
Which one is it?

30:22.850 --> 30:24.586
B. B-negative.

30:24.586 --> 30:27.033
You'll have AB-positive by tomorrow night, I swear.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.833
Make certain I do.

30:49.714 --> 30:53.536
Engage the engine, and proceed to the second location.

30:53.536 --> 30:54.801
Nice ray gun.

30:54.801 --> 30:56.992
Am I supposed to believe that thing's for real?

30:59.802 --> 31:01.877
Drive.

31:08.715 --> 31:12.556
Ten grand apiece for the last three,
and I'm not going to see a penny of it.

31:12.556 --> 31:16.926
Don't speak until we're out of visual range.

31:20.147 --> 31:23.274
45 milliliters from the new arrival.

31:53.329 --> 31:55.832
You catch these guys, and I get immunity, right?

31:55.832 --> 31:57.665
We're not talking about copping to a lesser charge.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.400
When my associate returns, we'll discuss the details.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.395
Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, okay?

32:02.395 --> 32:06.135
If your associate doesn't catch them,
they're going to come looking for me, okay?

32:06.135 --> 32:07.817
You two better keep your word.

32:07.817 --> 32:12.163
You've been abducting people for money,
and you're questioning our honesty?

32:39.555 --> 32:40.944
Sit back.

32:40.944 --> 32:41.920
Relax...

32:41.920 --> 32:43.741
I'm just getting a smoke.

32:46.771 --> 32:49.435
What are you doing?

32:49.435 --> 32:52.209
I don't know about you, honey,
but I'm a little tense, you know what I mean?

32:52.209 --> 32:54.501
Extinguish that now.

32:54.501 --> 32:58.212
If you want some air, open your window.

32:58.212 --> 33:00.135
Now.

33:44.073 --> 33:46.321
Stay exactly where you are.

33:56.074 --> 33:57.178
T'Pol.

33:57.178 --> 33:59.368
They brought a bio-reactor with them.

33:59.368 --> 34:01.574
They're synthesizing some kind of viral agent.

34:01.574 --> 34:03.740
Rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.767
This could be it.

34:04.767 --> 34:06.528
Why would they travel back through time?

34:06.528 --> 34:09.186
Daniels said they might be hiding from someone.

34:09.186 --> 34:11.650
The past seems like a pretty good place to hide.

34:11.650 --> 34:15.350
We've got to keep them from getting it back to our time.

34:15.350 --> 34:17.889
Are you in a position to disable all three of them?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.357
I don't know.

34:19.357 --> 34:21.289
I was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor,

34:21.289 --> 34:24.150
but I could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city.

34:24.150 --> 34:26.099
They must have some kind of temporal beacon.

34:26.099 --> 34:29.511
If you can destroy it, they'll have no way of getting back.

34:29.511 --> 34:30.909
I've got to find it first.

34:30.909 --> 34:33.393
Modify your scanner to a delta band frequency.

35:48.770 --> 35:51.942
They've gone out the west door.

35:51.942 --> 35:55.260
They could be headed for the street.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.466
They have the virus!

36:07.491 --> 36:09.142
- T'Pol?
- Yes, Captain?

36:09.142 --> 36:11.986
They're in the west alleyway, north of the main building.
I could use some help.

36:11.986 --> 36:13.690
Acknowledged.

36:16.995 --> 36:18.587
Drive.

36:18.587 --> 36:20.676
Trouble?

36:20.676 --> 36:22.405
Drive.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.130
Pull over and stop here.

36:47.554 --> 36:50.398
They give you all that fancy equipment, and what good does it do you?

36:50.398 --> 36:52.540
Lower your window.

36:52.540 --> 36:55.610
I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work.

36:55.610 --> 36:58.236
Be quiet.

36:58.236 --> 37:00.753
They're coming.

37:08.951 --> 37:10.307
Stop!

37:37.359 --> 37:38.710
Come on.

38:05.437 --> 38:07.461
He's trying to release the toxin.

38:09.171 --> 38:12.652
We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century.

38:12.652 --> 38:15.512
Perhaps he has no other choice.

38:16.944 --> 38:20.033
If he's trying to destroy humanity,
he's not going to be able to do it with that.

38:20.033 --> 38:22.992
They only modified the virus for six blood types.

38:22.992 --> 38:25.633
And if they can infect three quarters of Earth's population,

38:25.633 --> 38:30.408
it's unlikely humans would pose a threat to them in the future.

38:30.408 --> 38:33.507
Let's hope he can't see in the dark.

38:33.507 --> 38:35.309
Keep laying down fire.

39:22.421 --> 39:25.054
Don't move a muscle.

39:25.054 --> 39:26.862
Drop it.

39:32.064 --> 39:35.264
Why a second weapon?

39:35.264 --> 39:37.458
Where were you going to take it?

39:37.458 --> 39:42.414
We won't allow you to destroy us.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.668
Your species is doomed.

40:11.152 --> 40:12.603
Let's go.

40:18.569 --> 40:20.141
Problem, sir?

40:21.772 --> 40:23.722
It's done.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.130
Sir?

40:25.130 --> 40:26.634
Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

40:26.634 --> 40:27.434
Go ahead.

40:27.434 --> 40:29.152
Get a team down to the Command Center, on the double.

40:29.152 --> 40:30.362
Aye, sir.

40:30.362 --> 40:31.826
Wait here for Malcolm.

40:31.826 --> 40:33.614
Have everything brought to Cargo Bay Two.

40:33.614 --> 40:35.531
I've got to get this to Phlox.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.517
What's going on?

40:37.517 --> 40:39.137
Come with me.

41:06.149 --> 41:07.512
Get out of the car!

41:07.512 --> 41:08.875
He's on something.

41:08.875 --> 41:09.779
Get out of the car!

41:09.779 --> 41:10.860
Keep your hands where we can see them!

41:10.860 --> 41:12.047
Come on.
Come on!

41:12.047 --> 41:13.655
W-What's going on?

41:14.938 --> 41:16.755
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I didn't do anything!

41:16.755 --> 41:18.168
We got a tip says you did.

41:18.168 --> 41:20.392
You're just lucky all six of them are still alive.

41:20.392 --> 41:23.659
The two cops who came to my place... they offered me a deal.

41:23.659 --> 41:25.042
That's the only reason I helped them!

41:25.042 --> 41:26.460
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:26.460 --> 41:29.308
- Get him out of here.
- Those creatures.

41:29.308 --> 41:31.813
The lizard-people.
They're around here somewhere.

41:31.813 --> 41:34.356
- You gotta find them!
- No problem. We'll get right on that.

41:34.356 --> 41:36.677
Be careful. Be careful.
They've got ray-guns.

41:36.677 --> 41:39.658
Yeah, ray-guns. Got it.
Watch your head.
