25:57.069 --> 25:58.615
Yeah, she's cool.

She's different than the other girls
at my old school.

lil' homie, don't rush it.

26:05.879 --> 26:08.467
Is this your way of telling me to back off
or you'll kill me?

26:08.551 --> 26:12.266
C'mon, man, I'm just...
telling you not to get caught up.

26:12.350 --> 26:14.354
You're 16. Things change.

26:14.437 --> 26:18.028
They start, they stop.
Sometimes they end.

You can't play your game
if you're in your feelings.

26:23.413 --> 26:25.501
Gotta keep your eyes open.

26:25.585 --> 26:26.796
Stay woke.

26:28.006 --> 26:31.597
So, what you're saying is that
I shouldn't trust Livvie

26:31.681 --> 26:33.851
or really anyone in life, ever.

26:33.935 --> 26:36.941
No, man. You young'uns overthink
every damn thing.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.695
All I'm saying is,

26:38.778 --> 26:40.657
you can't win without discernment.

26:42.744 --> 26:44.497
That's how Nana B would say it.

27:05.414 --> 27:07.418
[turns engine off]

27:09.673 --> 27:12.763

'cause I want you to win.

27:12.846 --> 27:13.848
You know that, right?

27:16.645 --> 27:17.939
Right.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.363

ALEX:
What are you doing here?

28:01.442 --> 28:03.029
I'm taking you home.

28:08.331 --> 28:10.795
Guess I shouldn't
overthink this either, huh?

28:10.878 --> 28:12.924
DARIUS:
This is just the way the game is played.

28:13.008 --> 28:15.178
I'm sorry, Alex.

28:37.473 --> 28:40.813
GEOFFREY:
You finally beat me. You win.

28:42.149 --> 28:44.236
Congrats, I guess.

28:44.320 --> 28:49.706
DARIUS: [scoffs] "Finally"? C'mon, man,
I beat you lots of times.

28:49.790 --> 28:51.501
What, you mean playin' bones?

28:51.585 --> 28:55.384
[scoffs] Man, I-- I used to let you win.

28:56.804 --> 29:01.187
I could see how important it was to you,
and to me it was, uh, just a game.

29:01.270 --> 29:04.611
Nah, you're just saying that
because you lost, bro.

29:04.695 --> 29:07.408
GEOFFREY:
I'm saying it because it's true.

29:10.455 --> 29:12.376
[laughs]

29:12.459 --> 29:15.925
Or just because
I'm messing with you. [laughs]

29:16.008 --> 29:19.223
That look on your face right now? Mm.

29:19.306 --> 29:21.310
How many nights
you gonna lie awake in bed,

29:21.394 --> 29:22.856
replaying those games in your head,

29:22.939 --> 29:25.485
wondering if I really
blew 'em on purpose?

29:25.570 --> 29:28.534
[laughs]

29:28.617 --> 29:30.078
Uh...

29:33.334 --> 29:35.798
I'm sorry, man.

29:35.882 --> 29:37.301
For all of it.

29:39.305 --> 29:40.641
Yeah.

29:43.021 --> 29:45.025
I just want what you owe me, G.

29:56.965 --> 30:00.180
Your copy of the deed

30:00.263 --> 30:01.725
Catherine's already looked over it.

[inhales, exhales]

30:08.279 --> 30:10.450
Twenty damn years late.

30:13.498 --> 30:15.418
But I'll take it how I can get it.

30:16.045 --> 30:18.132
GEOFFREY:
The team's moving out as we speak.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.680
They'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

30:20.763 --> 30:23.727
You sell it, get a new start
wherever you want.

30:23.811 --> 30:25.648

Or I could hold onto it.

30:25.731 --> 30:29.113
Build it up, hire some of the old gang
to help out.

30:29.196 --> 30:32.494
Become an entrepreneur. Like you.

30:37.922 --> 30:40.803
Except...not like you.

30:42.765 --> 30:44.686
Because I won't forget who I am.

30:46.063 --> 30:47.399
Or where I'm from.

30:49.278 --> 30:51.157
You do you, my man.

30:53.077 --> 30:55.958
But this is it, Darius.

30:56.042 --> 31:00.008
I get into that car with my son,
drive out of here,

31:00.091 --> 31:01.845
and it's over.

31:14.746 --> 31:16.040
What's this?

31:16.123 --> 31:18.879
GEOFFREY: That is a key
to a suite at the Gordon Hotel.

31:19.923 --> 31:23.847
Give you and Tamar and the baby
a little taste of your new life.

31:26.268 --> 31:29.066

31:32.364 --> 31:33.491
Yeah, man.

We good, G.

32:07.602 --> 32:10.106
Darius buy that for you?

32:10.190 --> 32:11.442
Give it to me.

32:14.699 --> 32:16.870
Give me the damn phone, Alex.

32:21.212 --> 32:23.675
Might be tracking us.

32:23.759 --> 32:24.886
Who's "they"?

32:31.023 --> 32:32.568
Where are we going?

32:32.652 --> 32:34.321
Somewhere safe.

32:36.492 --> 32:39.874
Your mom and I, we, uh...

32:39.958 --> 32:41.210
we have some scores to settle,

32:41.293 --> 32:42.964
but we're getting you
the hell out of here first.

32:44.216 --> 32:46.428
Can't tell you everything now, but...

32:46.513 --> 32:49.226
You don't have to say it. I get it.
It's for my own good.

32:53.527 --> 32:55.280
GEOFFREY:
It's just too dangerous.

33:12.355 --> 33:14.359
[cell phone ringing]

33:24.589 --> 33:26.175
This better be important.

33:28.597 --> 33:30.475
Hello, Alex?

33:31.811 --> 33:33.481
So, where's Mom?

33:33.565 --> 33:36.153
She's meeting us in Van Nuys.

33:36.237 --> 33:37.322
At the airport.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.577
Shit.
They're kidnapping Alex.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.121
Is it really kidnapping
if they're his parents?

33:41.205 --> 33:43.961
Seeing as they are teen-murdering
sociopaths, I'd say yes.

33:44.044 --> 33:45.088
We've got to stop them.

33:45.171 --> 33:46.925
What's with the 180?
You were just leading the charge

33:47.008 --> 33:48.512
on Team Alex Sucks Ass.

33:48.595 --> 33:50.975
NICO:
He does, but he needs our help.

33:51.058 --> 33:54.524
KAROLINA: It's OK to admit
that you care about him. I do.

33:54.607 --> 33:56.528
CHASE: I kinda miss his square head
and chicken legs.

33:56.611 --> 33:59.366
GERT: His bad pitches for mission titles
and codenames.

33:59.449 --> 34:01.788
MOLLY: And even though he thinks
he's smarter than everyone,

34:01.871 --> 34:04.084
he really is smart.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.629
And I miss him, too.

34:09.428 --> 34:11.766
What? I got issues.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.226
About talking about my feelings.

34:13.311 --> 34:15.983
Or just generally having them.

34:16.065 --> 34:18.154
But for now, actions speak
louder than words,

34:18.237 --> 34:20.576
and I say we head to the Valley
and get Alex back.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.495
Gert, I think you should just stay here.

34:22.580 --> 34:25.753
After the brain thing this morning,
I just don't think it's a good idea.

34:25.835 --> 34:28.592
That's sweet of you. But seeing as
I haven't gone full Britney yet,

34:28.675 --> 34:30.846
I don't need a conservator.

34:30.929 --> 34:34.061
I can make my own decisions, and I--
I want to join you.

34:34.143 --> 34:37.108
Join us doing what, though?
How are we even getting to Van Nuys?

34:38.402 --> 34:39.697
We have a car.

34:41.283 --> 34:42.703
CHASE:
Without a key, it won't start.

34:42.786 --> 34:43.996
KAROLINA:
Maybe Nico's Staff can help.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.375
No, the Staff can't control a car.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.668
Just seems to work with the elements.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.424
Earth, air, water...

34:49.509 --> 34:50.803
Fire.

35:04.914 --> 35:06.417
If I hold these together,
all I need is a--

35:06.500 --> 35:07.628
Spark.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.264
[engine starts]

35:13.347 --> 35:15.101
Come on. We have to hurry.

35:16.145 --> 35:19.025

It's up to us to bring him home.

A hippocampus-stimulated
facsimile of me, but yes.

36:01.694 --> 36:03.239
It's me, Victor.

36:06.538 --> 36:09.961
Jonah said the algorithm was based on
you being at work with your father, but...

36:12.090 --> 36:13.593
...you said that he was a banker.

36:14.846 --> 36:17.977
One of many lies
I have told you over the years.

36:19.437 --> 36:23.195
But I've had a lot of time
with my own thoughts out here--

36:23.279 --> 36:26.995
in here, wherever the hell we are--

36:27.078 --> 36:30.418
and I've changed. Truly.

36:31.796 --> 36:33.173
You--

36:35.596 --> 36:37.307
You look wonderful.

36:38.643 --> 36:40.939
I'm surprised you're so happy to see me.

36:43.904 --> 36:45.574
Since I shot you.

36:45.657 --> 36:46.993
You shot me?

36:49.372 --> 36:51.001
I assumed it was Robert.

36:54.592 --> 36:55.969
[Victor sighs]

36:57.598 --> 37:01.313
Well, I-- [sighs]

37:01.396 --> 37:03.400
I wasn't in my right mind.

37:04.110 --> 37:08.243
And I could blame the tumor
or Jonah's "cure," but...

37:09.789 --> 37:11.291
it was me.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.838
I've caused so much pain.

37:13.922 --> 37:15.676
And I want to make it up to you.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.055
And Chase.

37:19.391 --> 37:22.648
But first, you have got
to get me out of here.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.529
I will.

37:25.612 --> 37:27.240
I promise.

37:29.077 --> 37:30.956
But we're gonna do this my way.

37:31.039 --> 37:34.045
We build the box for Jonah
as fast as we can.

37:34.129 --> 37:37.343
And I will make sure that you're released
the moment it's done.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.811
But that's not actually why I'm here.

37:43.648 --> 37:45.902
How are your alien
crypto-analysis skills?

37:48.115 --> 37:49.910
Honey, I thought you'd never ask.

37:55.212 --> 37:57.843
VICTOR: Jonah's traveling
far from home, but he is smart.

37:57.926 --> 38:01.349
And careful. The key that unlocks
the cipher can't be written down

38:01.433 --> 38:04.940
in case it falls into enemy hands,
so it's got to be easy to remember.

38:05.024 --> 38:07.654
JANET: So you're saying
we have to hack Jonah's password.

38:07.738 --> 38:10.242
VICTOR: Except I doubt it's a word.
It's more likely an equation.

38:10.326 --> 38:12.915
JANET: But does he even
have the same math that we do?

38:12.998 --> 38:14.835
VICTOR:
Well, that's the beauty of math, my love.

38:14.919 --> 38:19.094
It's the universal language.
Try gravity, anti-gravity, relativity.

Geoffrey doesn't know
I'm waiting here for you.

42:31.890 --> 42:33.603
Hm.

42:33.686 --> 42:37.359
CATHERINE: He loves you like a brother,
but I don't.

42:37.443 --> 42:40.490
I don't care about your past together.

42:40.575 --> 42:42.746
I only care about my family's future,

42:42.829 --> 42:47.087
and that future is only truly safe
without you in it.

42:48.089 --> 42:49.718
[laughs]

42:52.222 --> 42:53.851
Hmm.

42:53.934 --> 42:57.358
Now we know who's the real G
in the Wilder family.

42:57.441 --> 42:59.696
It's been you all along.

42:59.780 --> 43:01.867
You made me take the rap for Geoffrey.

43:01.950 --> 43:04.873
-I was looking out for my client.
-DARIUS: You kept him from coming around.

43:04.956 --> 43:07.336
You're the reason he cut ties.

43:07.419 --> 43:10.175
You and Geoffrey and these
back-in-the-day '90s fantasies.

43:10.258 --> 43:12.388
There was no way
we could have the life that we have--

43:12.471 --> 43:14.225
Without betraying me.

43:15.477 --> 43:16.980
So, what do we do now?

43:17.064 --> 43:20.445
You wanna pay me off?
Take the deed back?

43:29.923 --> 43:33.388
I only gave up Alex because I thought
he'd be better with his family.

43:33.471 --> 43:35.308
CATHERINE:
You're gonna do one more thing for him.

43:35.392 --> 43:36.729
Yeah, what's that?

43:36.812 --> 43:38.733
Same as you did for his father.

43:38.816 --> 43:40.318
Take the rap for his murder charge.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.979

FEMALE REPORTER: The murder
appears to be a drug deal gone bad.

44:55.887 --> 44:59.769
Authorities are saying Darius Davis,
whose body was found at the Gordon Hotel,

44:59.853 --> 45:04.069
is also responsible for the murder
of Destiny Gonzalez, a teen runaway.

45:04.153 --> 45:08.871
Previous reports had linked six wealthy
Westside teenagers to the killing,

45:08.954 --> 45:11.042
but they are now cleared of those charges.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.797
Those kids remain at large,
and their parents are asking the--

This was all my parents.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.036
I know it.

45:31.917 --> 45:36.593
But the good news is,
we're not wanted for murder anymore, so...

45:36.677 --> 45:40.100
Bad news is...your friend died.

45:40.183 --> 45:42.647
Not sure he was ever really my friend.

45:44.483 --> 45:46.362
You know who still is?

45:47.447 --> 45:49.995
Found this lying around.

45:50.078 --> 45:51.707
Maybe we can play like...

45:53.669 --> 45:55.548

Uh, something called "Street Fighter II"?

46:04.816 --> 46:07.655
No way. You're kidding.
That's a classic!

46:07.739 --> 46:09.158
If you say so.

46:10.201 --> 46:11.287
Let's see.

46:16.673 --> 46:18.510
Can I ask you something?

46:18.594 --> 46:19.721
ALEX:
Yeah.

46:21.015 --> 46:24.564
So, why'd you call me...

46:24.647 --> 46:26.025
of all people?

46:26.108 --> 46:29.323
Well, because...

46:29.406 --> 46:32.789
I am obsessively over-organized,

46:32.872 --> 46:37.005
and when I set up my speed dial...

46:38.091 --> 46:39.218
you were number one.

46:44.144 --> 46:45.438
Thank you.

ALEX:
You know...

46:53.956 --> 46:57.129
if this is all there is
for the rest of our lives...

46:59.133 --> 47:00.761
I'm good with that.

47:02.598 --> 47:04.769
You know, it sounds cliché...

47:06.105 --> 47:08.025
but we have each other.

You can be Blanka.

47:17.210 --> 47:20.926
You guys, like, used to have
the same hair, right?

47:21.010 --> 47:22.930
ALEX: [laughs]
Sure.

47:24.559 --> 47:28.065
So, are you gonna tell me
what you've been doing this whole time?

47:28.149 --> 47:30.486
-Do you really wanna know?
-I asked.

47:30.571 --> 47:32.700
OK, well, um,

47:32.783 --> 47:35.748
I kinda met this girl that I like.

47:37.960 --> 47:39.756
You have a girlfriend?

Shut. Up. Really?

-That's so cool. You do?
-Well, I--

I mean, I did, kind of, but--

47:47.980 --> 47:51.529

After today, that's probably all over.
