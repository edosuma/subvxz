In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.371 --> 00:06.207
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.342
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.376 --> 00:10.278
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.311 --> 00:11.779
are members of an elite squad

00:11.812 --> 00:14.082
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.516
These are their stories.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.764
Greenpoint.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.701
Brooklyn?
No way. Out of service.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.036
I said
out of service, lady!

00:37.805 --> 00:39.373
You okay?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.075
Bastard!

00:45.713 --> 00:47.381
[tires screech]

00:47.415 --> 00:48.816
Crazy bitch!
What's your name?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.284
Where do you live?

00:50.318 --> 00:51.319
I told you--Greenpoint.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.323
You're going
to pay for this.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.424
Problem?

00:56.457 --> 00:57.691
Damn drunk
busted my window!

00:57.725 --> 00:58.759
Ma'am?

00:58.792 --> 00:59.860
He tried
to run me over.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.362
Look what she did
to my cab!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.696
Okay, let's everybody
just cool down.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.598
Forget it!
I want her locked up.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.766
Just wait, please.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.471
I was just raped.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.706
Name's Myra Denning.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.208
Graduate student
at City Arts.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.443
Got into a hassle
with a cabbie.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.577
We tried to calm it down.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.711
She suddenly outcries
about a rape.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.713
She know who did it?
Wouldn't say.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.648
Really freaked out
when we asked.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.749
Figured I'd
better call you.

01:21.782 --> 01:22.816
Thank you.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.286
Hi, I'm Detective Stabler.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.887
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.690
Can you tell us
what happened?

01:29.723 --> 01:30.891
I can't.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.460
Okay, we're gonna
get you to the hospital.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.761
I'll ride.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.429
Anyone see
where she came from?

01:35.463 --> 01:38.132
Cabbie said she was
staggering down the street.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.135
Okay, let's start
a canvass, huh?

01:41.169 --> 01:43.637
Detective, this man says
he saw what happened.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.439
Well, I didn't
exactly see it,

01:45.473 --> 01:46.540
but I heard the commotion.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.309
I looked out and I saw
the ambulance.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.344
Uh, I live up there,
third floor.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.545
What's your name, sir?

01:51.579 --> 01:53.314
Ron Polikoff.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.416
I, uh, I know Myra.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.486
Is she okay?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.389
She says she was raped.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.623
You know anything
about that, Mr. Polikoff?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.727
She's going
to say I did it.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.618
We're here.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.456
We're gonna be inside
in no time.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.691
Please,
can I just go home?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.926
You've come this far, Myra.
Don't give up now.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.328
Where's my portfolio?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.563
It's right here
on the end of the gurney.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.797
We're gonna take
good care of it.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.732
My prints got thrown
all over the street

03:18.766 --> 03:20.468
when the taxi driver
took off.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.003
Oh, you must think
I'm such a loser.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.905
No, I think that you're
scared and upset,

03:24.938 --> 03:26.307
which you have
every right to be

03:26.340 --> 03:29.243
after what
just happened to you.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.511
Oh, my God.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.383
Please don't
let him see me.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.687
It's okay.
Don't worry.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.922
Keep moving, guys.
Keep moving.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.592
Let's go.
Let's get her inside.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.693
Was that Myra?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.595
Follow me.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.334
Where are we going?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.469
Medical examiner's
office.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.940
We're not going
to the morgue, are we?

03:59.973 --> 04:02.042
It's right next door.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.612
Is Ron
gonna be arrested?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.347
My partner's
talking to him.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.948
What happens now?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.284
Louise is a sexual
assault nurse.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.685
She's gonna check
that you're okay,

04:11.719 --> 04:12.886
and then we're gonna
do a rape kit.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.488
What's that?

04:14.522 --> 04:15.589
It's an exam to collect

04:15.623 --> 04:17.591
any forensic evidence
from the assault.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.628
Do I have to do it?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.563
No, suspect exams
are voluntary.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.864
You can leave any time.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.299
Will it prove
I'm innocent?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.634
Definitely help.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.835
Because I am innocent.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.939
Unless, uh, bad sex
is against the law.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.508
Consensual bad sex?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.876
Absolutely.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.315
Dr. Warner,
this is Ron Polikoff.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.717
Sorry, can't shake hands.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.387
I need you to get undressed
behind the screen.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.889
Do, I, uh, do I have
to take everything off?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.024
Yes.
I'll take that.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.327
Stand on the paper.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.962
Put your clothes
in the labeled bags.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.564
I'll collect them later.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.865
I showered before
I left my apartment.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.367
Does that matter?

04:59.400 --> 05:02.102
The Lumalight can still
show traces of body fluids.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.707
Um...Ron called me.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.411
He said he wanted
to talk to me about my work.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.480
And he told me to come over.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.881
I said feel free
to drop by.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.816
I didn't know she'd
show up at 9:00 the same night.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.017
Still,
you invited her in.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.652
Well, yeah.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.621
She wanted me
to look at her portfolio.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.023
You know, I'm on
her MFA committee.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.592
He's your teacher?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.093
Well, not like
my teacher-teacher.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.795
I'm a graduate student.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.631
Right, but he still
grades your work.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.534
Yeah, but I'm one
of six people evaluating her.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.669
Well, what happened when
she got into your apartment?

05:35.703 --> 05:36.737
We talked.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.805
I opened
a bottle of wine.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.607
Do you often

05:39.640 --> 05:41.575
invite your students
over for drinks?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.811
Yeah, he does
all the time.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.479
He just loves
to get to know his students.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.980
Especially the women.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.849
Well, I, I, um,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.618
I find that my students
are more relaxed and honest

05:50.651 --> 05:51.785
about their work
in a domestic setting.

05:51.819 --> 05:55.789
Do I have to
take off my shorts?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.491
Please.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.906
Come to the table,
please.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.017
So...

06:24.051 --> 06:24.918
You had some wine.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.556
Yeah, just...

06:28.589 --> 06:30.524
Just a couple
of glasses.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.792
We were talking.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.661
One thing
led to another.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.929
I should have known better,
but we started kissing.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.197
And you were okay
with that?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.699
With the kissing, yeah,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.601
but not with what happened
afterwards, no.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.036
What's that?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.638
A Lumalight.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.939
It detects any body fluids
on the skin.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.207
It won't hurt.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.542
I'll get the light.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.977
Okay, gotta put
your arm out here.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.189
Okay, there's something
on your thigh.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.958
It's so humiliating.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.960
You're doing fine.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.631
I'm gonna take a sample,
and send it to the lab.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.600
So tell me what happened
after the kissing.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.703
He wouldn't stop.
He was all over me.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.871
She wouldn't stop.
She was all over me.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.773
Which would have been fine,

07:19.807 --> 07:22.543
but I just, I wasn't
into what she wanted.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.844
(doctor)
Found something.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.679
There are fluids
on your shoulder.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.914
What did she want?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.249
She wanted me to be rough.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.885
Not play rough, be rough.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.687
She told me
to hold her down.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.023
He grabbed me by my neck
really hard,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.891
and he held me down.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.660
And then
what happened?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.631
I begged him to stop.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.898
And he didn't, he--

07:44.932 --> 07:46.667
When are you gonna be done?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.902
Louise is just gonna check
your wounds and abrasions,

07:48.936 --> 07:50.237
and then I'm gonna
photograph them.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.540
Open your mouth,
please.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.174
Abrasion on the tongue.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.576
She bit me.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.810
Show me your tongue.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.717
When I wouldn't
hold her hard enough,

08:03.751 --> 08:04.952
she--she bit me.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.754
I mean, look at this.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.091
And then she
tears me up with her nails.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.161
You fought him.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.629
As hard as I could.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.997
But he had his hands
around my neck.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.231
(Stabler)
You had your hands
around her neck?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.667
Oh, yeah, it was
the only way

08:19.700 --> 08:21.034
I could keep her
from attacking me.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.870
And at this point,
is it still consensual?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.639
Yes, but, you know,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.675
I just wanted to get
the whole thing over with

08:27.708 --> 08:30.043
and get her out
of my apartment.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.745
Did she ever
accuse you of raping her?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.046
No, but I could tell
she was upset

08:33.080 --> 08:34.915
when I didn't
ask her to stay.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.650
I wasn't too surprised

08:36.684 --> 08:38.652
when I heard a commotion
in the street.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.255
You're her professor.
You called the shots.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.657
But you were helpless?

08:46.760 --> 08:50.097
Look, my wife left me
nine months ago.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.734
And I was lonely,
and I wasn't thinking straight.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.769
And this Myra,
she came at me

08:55.803 --> 08:57.905
like a bird
hits your windshield.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.607
You know?
And I just went off the road.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.275
I crashed.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.812
Haven't you felt that way?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.314
You think you're in control,
but you're not.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.085
We've got
everything we need now.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.087
We'll wait for the lab results,
compare statements,

09:14.121 --> 09:16.824
and decide if we
have a case.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.991
I'm free to go?

09:18.025 --> 09:20.761
Yeah.
You're free to go.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.865
(Myra)
Why did he
have to hurt me?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.266
I worshipped him,
and he just treated me

09:26.299 --> 09:29.336
like a piece of trash.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.673
But I started it.
I kissed him.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.108
And then you said no,
and that's enough.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.611
"No"?

09:37.645 --> 09:40.113
Enough to count?

09:40.147 --> 09:42.215
Absolutely.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.817
It's okay.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.753
Sorry, it hurt
when you touched me.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.254
That's okay.
Just gonna take time.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.822
You're gonna get better.

09:48.856 --> 09:51.358
Okay, please,
can I go home now?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.226
We still have to do
the vaginal exam.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.129
Okay, can you open your legs
a little bit more?

09:56.163 --> 09:59.199
You're gonna feel
a little pressure.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.868
[gasps]

10:15.048 --> 10:16.116
How's Myra?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.417
This girl
had it pretty tough.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.653
The way he tells it,
she was looking for rough sex.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.088
Oh, yeah.
That's what they all say.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.690
Well,
sometimes it's true.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.357
I need to voucher
this rape kit at the lab.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.759
Where's the sector car?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.928
Tell you what.
I'll call the 2-9.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.929
Wait with her
until they get here.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.230
You sure?
Yeah, go.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.398
Thank you.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.203
Yeah, this
is Detective Stabler,

10:36.236 --> 10:38.038
Manhattan SVU.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.372
I'm waiting for Sector Charlie
at St. Vincent's.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.008
You got an ETA for me?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.378
Okay, thanks.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.947
Take care of yourself.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.082
Hi, Myra.
I'm Detective Stabler.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.284
We spoke earlier.
I remember.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.354
Your car is not here yet.
There was a pile-up on the FDR.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.189
Oh, how long?

10:57.825 --> 10:59.359
About an hour.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.162
[crying]
Oh, I'm so tired.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.167
I'll take you home.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.002
Thank you.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.137
Do you have anybody
who can help you out

11:10.170 --> 11:12.105
in the next
couple days?

11:12.139 --> 11:14.207
My roommate,
if she's not too busy.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.045
Parents?

11:18.078 --> 11:21.014
I can't tell them this.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.283
You might be surprised.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.985
No, I wouldn't.

11:29.923 --> 11:33.093
I can't do this right now.
I feel so...

11:33.126 --> 11:35.128
I'm so scared.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.042
Think you can make it?

11:49.076 --> 11:52.145
I don't know.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.147
Okay, try.
I'll be right behind you.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.367
You did great.

12:14.401 --> 12:19.206
[keys jingling]

12:19.239 --> 12:22.943
[door opens, shuts]

12:25.278 --> 12:27.447
I think it could be
buyer's remorse.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.482
Myra had the physical reaction
of a victim.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.451
She didn't want
to be touched.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.991
Sounds like you believe
Ron Polikoff.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.093
Well, look, he could have
agreed to that suspect exam

12:40.127 --> 12:41.962
because he's playing us,
or he's an honest guy

12:41.995 --> 12:43.230
who doesn't know
what the hell hit him.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.098
Benson.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.800
Really?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.904
Okay, thanks.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.505
That was Warner.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.808
The fluids
on Myra's silk teddy

12:54.842 --> 12:56.276
match Ron Polikoff's
blood type.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.211
I figured that.

12:58.245 --> 13:02.582
We didn't figure there'd be
a second blood type.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.885
Myra entertained
two guys last night.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.859
What is this about?
Have you arrested Ron?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.060
We've questioned him.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.831
Myra, did you
have sex with anyone

13:17.865 --> 13:20.100
besides Ron Polikoff
yesterday?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.102
No!
Why are you asking me that?

13:22.135 --> 13:22.970
Well, we got
a preliminary

13:23.003 --> 13:24.905
lab result
on your teddy.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.573
There's semen
from two men on it.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.178
Myra, if you had

13:31.211 --> 13:33.613
consensual sex
with somebody yesterday,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
that doesn't change
what happened with Ron.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.421
Is this some trick
to see if I'm lying?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.623
No, but you need
to tell us.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.358
I have told you:
I didn't have sex

13:45.392 --> 13:47.160
with anybody but Ron Polikoff
that night,

13:47.194 --> 13:49.596
and it wasn't sex,
it was rape.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.865
Sooner we get the DNA
from the rape kit, the better.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.066
I can't
draft the complaint

13:53.100 --> 13:55.068
unless I know
what she's hiding and why.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.203
Maybe
she's just embarrassed

13:56.236 --> 13:58.071
about having sex
with two men in one day.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.372
She better get over it.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.540
Two samples are enough

14:00.573 --> 14:03.043
to get her sexual history
admitted.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.178
Captain Cragen,
Donna Emmett wants to see you.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.947
And I do see him,
thank you.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.951
Gang's all here,
and the complainant too.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.119
How can I help you?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.520
I understand
your detectives

14:13.553 --> 14:15.088
entertained
a client of mine last night,

14:15.122 --> 14:16.223
Ron Polikoff.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.491
He volunteered
for a suspect exam.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
Something I would have
strongly discouraged

14:20.060 --> 14:21.294
had I been consulted.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.196
Is the D.A.'s office
planning to file charges?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.664
We're discussing that--
Discuss this.

14:24.697 --> 14:29.269
A list of Ms. Denning's
numerous sexual partners.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.338
I don't know
how you got this,

14:31.371 --> 14:32.672
but it's irrelevant.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.474
Ms. Denning's truthfulness,
or lack of it,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.343
is a matter of record.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.578
After rear-ending a van
on the BQE last year,

14:38.611 --> 14:40.213
she told
a heart-wrenching tale

14:40.247 --> 14:42.382
about being upset
about her grandmother's death.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.184
So upset, she couldn't
walk a straight line

14:44.217 --> 14:45.285
when the officer
asked her to.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.287
Well, if
her grandmother died--

14:47.320 --> 14:48.989
Her grandmother
miraculously came back to life

14:49.022 --> 14:50.057
and bailed her out.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.458
This time I understand

14:51.491 --> 14:53.226
she smashed a cab window
with a bottle?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.294
She was distraught.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.262
She was drunk.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.664
And I know this because
my client was with her

14:57.697 --> 14:59.132
when she got herself
that way.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.234
He didn't force her to drink
or to have sex.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.503
Let me know
when you drop the case.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.374
Better look at the list.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.110
So Ron Polikoff
wants to play dirty.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.012
How did Emmett
get those names so fast?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.446
That's a good question.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.681
Send Myra home and
get to those people

15:14.714 --> 15:15.548
before Emmett does.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.985
First name on the list
is Justin Wexler.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.222
Yeah, I know Myra.
I'm going out with her.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.524
(Stabler)
So, you're her boyfriend?

15:24.557 --> 15:27.427
Isn't that what
going out means?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.295
Can you tell us
when the last time

15:28.328 --> 15:29.562
you had sex
with Myra was?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.198
Sure.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.666
If you can tell me when
you last got laid.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.734
Where were you
last night?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.603
Here, with two friends.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.604
We watched the Knicks
get their asses kicked

15:37.637 --> 15:39.106
till about 11:00.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.974
And then I went to bed.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.343
Why, what's going on?
Is Myra in trouble?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.511
She may have been raped.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.518
Is there anything
I can do?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.086
Yeah, tell us when

15:53.120 --> 15:54.454
the last time
you slept together was.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.989
Um...

15:56.023 --> 15:57.224
three nights ago.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.691
(Benson)
You remember
what she was wearing?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.694
Some...slinky lace thing.
Black.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.430
A teddy?

16:05.532 --> 16:08.468
Wait a minute.
Is she accusing me?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.303
We need a DNA sample
to exclude you.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.342
Has she
been sleeping around?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.609
It's Ron Polikoff,
isn't it?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.481
I knew she'd cheat on me
with that fraud.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.416
Why would you
say that?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.285
'Cause she can't
stop talking about him.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.354
What is it with that guy?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.522
Some lousy gallery show
back in '85,

16:29.556 --> 16:31.158
and it still gets him laid.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.693
Girls at school
line up around the block to...

16:33.726 --> 16:35.528
inspire him.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.502
Here's your DNA sample.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.338
Pass it along to Myra
when you're done with it.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.340
Myra, why didn't
you tell us

16:47.374 --> 16:49.576
that you were dating
Justin Wexler?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.378
I'm sorry,
I didn't think it mattered,

16:51.411 --> 16:53.280
'cause I hadn't seen him
in a couple of days.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.183
Or maybe you didn't want us
talking to your boyfriend.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.518
No, I didn't want him
knowing I was at Ron's,

16:58.551 --> 17:01.321
because he gets
ridiculously jealous.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.425
Is the second sample of DNA
that was on your teddy Justin's?

17:05.458 --> 17:06.659
Yes.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.161
And this
is the same teddy

17:08.195 --> 17:09.096
that you wore
to Ron Polikoff's?

17:13.133 --> 17:16.103
This is so embarrassing.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.205
I got home from Justin's,
I took it off,

17:18.238 --> 17:19.472
and I threw it
in a pile of clothes.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.807
And then last night,
Ron called me,

17:20.840 --> 17:22.675
and he wanted to go over
my thesis proposal.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.112
So, you know,
I just threw on some clothes.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.279
And the teddy.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.781
It looked clean.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.151
Have you had any other
recent sexual partners?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.086
Define recent.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.387
Max Bernbaum?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.822
Once, last May.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.658
Charlie Washington,
beginning of the semester.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.761
Where are you
getting all this?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.765
Myra, who else would know?

17:49.536 --> 17:52.872
It has to be Jenny,
my roommate.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.409
She has a big crush on Ron,
and when I told her that I...

17:56.443 --> 17:58.611
was raped...

17:58.645 --> 18:02.315
she acted like
I made the whole thing up.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.517
Yeah, I gave Ron the list.
So what?

18:04.551 --> 18:05.685
I thought Myra
was your friend.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.387
She's my roommate.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.123
She knows I like Ron,
so she goes over there

18:10.157 --> 18:11.524
and sleazes her way
into his bed.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.693
So you don't think
Myra was raped?

18:13.726 --> 18:15.162
By Ron?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.596
No.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.531
She was beat up
pretty badly.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.133
Myra gets crazy
when she drinks.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.869
Maybe she
fell down some stairs.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.272
She try to strangle
herself too?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.539
It wasn't Ron.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.241
He's not into kinky stuff.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.676
And you know this how?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.811
Personal experience?

18:31.844 --> 18:34.581
Actually, yes.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.149
I thought we were
in a relationship,

18:36.183 --> 18:38.451
then he goes
and bones my roommate.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.419
That's a good reason
for you

18:39.452 --> 18:41.188
to be pissed at Ron.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.790
So why would you tell him
about Myra's sexual partners?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.158
He was really upset!

18:45.192 --> 18:47.694
Myra was charging him
with rape.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.230
He admitted he screwed her,
and he apologized to me.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.664
(Benson)
So you're seeing him again?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.500
He loves me, okay?

18:53.533 --> 18:57.204
I know he's not a rapist.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.239
What a gentleman.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.740
He gets back together
with Jenny

19:00.773 --> 19:02.442
so he can get dirt
on Myra.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.344
Wonder how long
that's gonna last.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.945
Let's talk
to Polikoff again.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.415
[doorbell rings]

19:08.448 --> 19:10.850
(Benson)
Is Ron Polikoff home?

19:10.883 --> 19:12.185
Who wants to know?

19:12.219 --> 19:14.287
How old are you,
sweetheart?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.488
(Ron)
She's sixteen.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.725
She's my daughter.

19:18.758 --> 19:19.959
Sophie, say hi
to the detectives.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.628
Hi.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.862
Dad, I'm late.
I need to take a shower.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.930
Yeah, okay.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.232
Come on in.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.637
I have Sophie Wednesdays
and every other weekend.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.540
It's not nearly enough.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.741
You thought she was
my girlfriend?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.776
We heard that you
like 'em young.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.910
Who said that?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.280
(Benson)
Doesn't matter.
Do you?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.714
I'm a father--
not a rapist

19:41.748 --> 19:43.483
or a child molester.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.452
I haven't dated
anyone under 21

19:45.485 --> 19:47.787
since I was
that age myself.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.356
Yeah, but you do
date students.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.391
Jenny, for example.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.793
Jenny's 25...
and she's not an undergraduate.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.862
If you want a list
of my girlfriends, just ask.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.498
We're more interested in
the list you gave your lawyer.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.766
The one
of Myra's boyfriends.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.334
Pretty long, isn't it?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.669
Kinda shows the woman
who's accusing me

20:02.702 --> 20:04.437
will sleep with
anything in pants.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.505
Is that why
you invited her

20:05.538 --> 20:06.639
over to your house
late at night?

20:06.673 --> 20:07.840
I said I wanted
to talk to her.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.609
I didn't know
she'd come right over.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.711
She says that she
was worried about her thesis.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.246
And she should have been.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.548
She brought her portfolio.
Her work's not good.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.016
(Benson)
Did you actually
look at it?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.084
Yeah, for about an hour.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.019
I even made notes
on some of the prints.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.821
Before you had sex?

20:21.854 --> 20:24.023
No, after.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.625
Look, do you guys
really think

20:25.658 --> 20:27.427
she'd have hung around
if I'd raped her?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.831
I get there,
he pours a glass of wine.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.734
We talk, I show him
my portfolio, he rapes me.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.636
Clear enough?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.271
So he looked at your drawings
before the rape?

20:38.305 --> 20:39.506
I just said that.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.873
What happened
after the attack?

20:43.876 --> 20:47.647
He walked out of the room.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.416
I couldn't move.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.818
I heard the shower.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.587
And then he came back out
and said,

20:54.621 --> 20:57.724
"You can't stay here
all night."

20:57.757 --> 21:00.293
So I got dressed
and I left.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.695
Okay.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.431
No, not okay.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.966
Why do I get the feeling
you guys think I'm lying?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.868
Myra, I believe you.
I just need to know the facts.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.770
You've got the facts.
What's next?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.741
So Warner says
that the other DNA sample

21:14.774 --> 21:17.877
on Myra's teddy
is indeed Justin Wexler's.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.945
Good. I don't think
that's gonna hurt us

21:18.978 --> 21:20.012
with the jury too much.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.881
The fact she wore
sexy silk underwear

21:21.914 --> 21:23.750
to Polikoff's
sure will.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.686
That's not an invitation
for rape.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.920
Maybe she didn't even
see it as rape

21:27.954 --> 21:29.021
until he told her
to leave.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.056
You guys,
I can't prosecute this

21:30.089 --> 21:31.591
until you agree.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.025
Call me when you
get on the same page.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.530
What is your problem
with Myra?

21:37.564 --> 21:38.798
She's neurotic.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.367
Look,
she chased after a guy

21:40.400 --> 21:41.534
whose life
is falling apart.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.635
So that gives him
the right

21:42.669 --> 21:44.337
to force her
to have sex?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.106
She was the one
who wanted to have sex.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.008
Really, did she
wanna be strangled too?
A lot of people do.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.910
Elliot, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.845
Myra hasn't told
a consistent story yet.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.814
She lied about when
he looked at her portfolio.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.883
Maybe he lied!
It's her word against his!

21:56.916 --> 21:58.785
Yeah, but her words
can put him in prison

21:58.818 --> 22:00.119
for ten years.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.756
She hails a cab
instead of calling the cops?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.624
She doesn't
even mention rape

22:04.657 --> 22:06.593
until she's
about to be arrested!

22:06.626 --> 22:07.694
Elliot, rape victims
are in shock!

22:07.727 --> 22:08.961
They're in denial.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.731
You know that.
You've seen it.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.600
I've also seen liars.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.569
Elliot!
Olivia!

22:16.603 --> 22:18.571
My office.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.510
You know Ms. Scarry.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.044
She now represents
Myra Denning.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.746
And I would like to know
why Ron Polikoff

22:26.779 --> 22:28.748
hasn't been arrested
for raping her.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.149
'Cause we don't have
enough evidence.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.385
My client's rape kit
isn't enough?

22:32.419 --> 22:33.853
Bruises, bites,
contusions,

22:33.886 --> 22:35.622
strangulation marks
on her neck?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.590
That could have been
caused by rough sex.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.891
Are you just
looking for reasons

22:38.925 --> 22:40.827
not to bring charges?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.595
This case
won't be easy to win.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.997
We don't want it
to fall apart.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.098
Maybe you do.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.967
Now, why would we?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.902
To hide the fact
that Detective Stabler

22:49.936 --> 22:52.705
sexually harassed
my client.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.141
Excuse me?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.676
You took her home
from the hospital.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.578
He was doing her a favor.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.712
And in her building,
you touched her

22:59.746 --> 23:01.514
in an inappropriate manner.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.915
The only time
I touched her

23:02.949 --> 23:05.885
was to stop her
from falling down the stairs.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.654
Maybe you used that
as an excuse to cop a feel.

23:07.687 --> 23:08.688
(Cragen)
That's enough, counselor.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.989
In twelve years,

23:10.022 --> 23:12.158
there has never been a complaint
against this man.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.726
Men change.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.663
Especially when their wives
file for legal separation.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.499
My investigator
checked the court documents.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.200
He also found out
that your wife took the kids

23:21.233 --> 23:23.803
and moved in
with her mother.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.076
You have no right

23:30.109 --> 23:32.011
to use my personal life
to make your case.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.213
I don't give a damn
about your personal life,

23:34.246 --> 23:36.783
unless it affects my client,
and it does.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.050
Stay away from her!

23:38.084 --> 23:40.520
I want Detective Stabler
off this case.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.121
And I want SVU
to do its job.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.499
Elliot...

23:52.532 --> 23:54.033
Elliot, stop!
Hey!

23:54.066 --> 23:55.702
What's going on?

23:55.735 --> 23:57.504
I touched her
in an inappropriate manner.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.838
Didn't you hear?

23:58.871 --> 23:59.772
I don't believe that.
Forget that.

23:59.806 --> 24:00.907
What's going on at home?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.241
Nothing.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.710
Hey. Would you
talk to me?

24:11.918 --> 24:14.053
Kathy left me.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.682
You okay?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.951
You need any time off,
you let me know, all right?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.119
I'm fine.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.655
Myra's allegation--

24:48.688 --> 24:51.023
you know I have to ask.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.692
It's crap.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.996
You broke procedure.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.297
Why did you
get into a car alone

24:58.330 --> 24:59.732
with a female victim?

24:59.766 --> 25:01.100
It's was 3:00
in the morning.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.169
The sector car was gonna be
an hour late.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.037
Why not just drop
her at her building?

25:05.071 --> 25:06.238
Why go inside?

25:06.272 --> 25:07.974
Captain, that girl
was dead on her feet.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.676
She lives in
a fifth-floor walk-up.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.977
That it?

25:11.010 --> 25:14.146
No, I wanted
to size her up.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.751
You should have done that
in the precinct.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.687
You really think
that lawyer's

25:20.720 --> 25:22.188
gonna file a complaint?

25:22.221 --> 25:24.190
I think Scarry's
just trying to bully us.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.259
We arrest Polikoff,
this'll all go away.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.228
I thought we decide
who we arrest.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.098
We do.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.033
And you are done
with Myra Denning.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.805
I don't know what to do.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.207
Only Ron and Myra know what
really went on in that room.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.942
What do the forensics show?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.711
The evidence
indicates rape,

25:44.744 --> 25:46.245
but Myra's behavior before
and after was pretty erratic.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.914
So her credibility's
an issue.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.215
What's SVU's position?

25:49.248 --> 25:50.683
Divided.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.652
That explains why Scarry
has threatened

25:52.685 --> 25:54.320
to go to the media
if they don't make an arrest.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.022
So I just wait.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.957
Skip the arrest.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.826
Bring an "X" indictment
to the grand jury.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.794
Present the evidence
and let the jurors decide

26:01.828 --> 26:03.596
whether there's a case.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.832
Detective Benson,
on what do you base your opinion

26:05.865 --> 26:07.734
Myra Denning was raped?

26:07.767 --> 26:09.168
Myra's behavior
was consistent

26:09.201 --> 26:10.937
with somebody who's been
sexually assaulted.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.104
She had all the symptoms

26:12.138 --> 26:13.806
of post-traumatic
stress disorder.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.374
Can you elaborate?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.009
It's like when a war veteran
hits the floor

26:17.043 --> 26:18.678
after a car backfires.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.313
Myra suffered an event
that was so traumatic for her

26:21.347 --> 26:23.950
that her body was actually
waiting for another assault.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.918
So she interpreted
Detective Stabler's gesture

26:25.952 --> 26:27.086
as an attack.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.755
Well, her body did.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.657
I touched her in the hospital
just to reassure her,

26:30.690 --> 26:32.591
and she flinched
as if I'd hit her.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.396
Myra, what happened?

26:37.429 --> 26:40.867
Miss Novak, my client
has something to show you.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.135
Apparently the police
aren't the only ones

26:43.169 --> 26:45.171
who don't want
this case to go forward.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.105
What are you
talking about?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.907
I checked my e-mail
this morning

26:47.940 --> 26:49.375
and...read this.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.277
"Whore, liar.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.779
Burn in hell.
I hope you die, bitch"?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.213
How many are there?

26:54.246 --> 26:55.181
30 so far.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.783
We'll put a trace
on the account.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.851
You can't--the e-mails
are from a free ISP.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.989
Screen name's Eagle.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.758
As in Eagle, Colorado.
The Kobe case.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.694
Anybody could have
sent these.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.328
No, it's Ron, for sure.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.198
Or one of those
angry men's groups.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.833
Dad's Manifesto,

27:13.866 --> 27:15.835
the National Alliance
of Free Men.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.036
There are plenty of trogs

27:17.069 --> 27:19.238
who think rape's
a feminist invention.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.841
How are they connected
to Ron Polikoff?

27:21.874 --> 27:23.375
It's obvious
he contacted them.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.211
They're using hate mail
and death threats

27:25.244 --> 27:26.946
to scare Myra
into dropping the charges.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.181
Can I borrow this?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.950
Our computer people
may be able to figure out

27:30.983 --> 27:32.218
who sent these e-mails.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.856
I can't trace
the screen name,

27:36.889 --> 27:40.760
but I did track the e-mails
to an address in Chelsea.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.696
2411 West 21st.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.397
City Arts.
Where Ron Polikoff teaches.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.300
And Myra
goes to school.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.469
Are you suggesting the Myra
sent these e-mails herself?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.304
I just don't think
we can count her out.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.373
Detectives, it might not
be either of them.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.442
The e-mails came
from a computer in the library.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.979
Anybody with a college I.D.
has access.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.815
I'll double check,
but I was at my desk all day,

28:02.849 --> 28:05.017
and I didn't see
Myra or Ron.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.018
So you know them?

28:06.052 --> 28:07.854
They're nice people.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.122
This mess has divided
the whole college.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.290
Half are on Myra's side,

28:11.323 --> 28:12.825
half on Ron's.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.761
All I know is they're both
going to lose.

28:14.794 --> 28:15.962
How's that?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.229
Look what happened to Ron.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.999
Dean called him in
this morning and fired him.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.034
Neither of them
checked out any books.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.302
How about the computers?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.037
Can you tell
who's been online?

28:25.071 --> 28:27.006
There's a sign-up sheet.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.078
And look who signed up.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.780
Polikoff.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.848
No, that's
his daughter Sophie.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.784
Faculty kids
have full access.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.254
You leaving town, Ron?

28:42.288 --> 28:45.758
College told me
to vacate faculty housing.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.760
So much for innocent
until proven guilty, huh?

28:47.794 --> 28:48.828
Rape or no rape, Ron,

28:48.861 --> 28:50.329
you did
sleep with a student.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.831
And that is
against the rules.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.234
Thanks, Jenny.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.503
I'll, uh,
get more stuff.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.939
So you and Jenny
still together, Ron?

28:59.972 --> 29:01.173
She's helping me
move out.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.241
To her place?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.010
Into a hotel.

29:04.043 --> 29:07.880
Look, I have lost my job.
I lost my home.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.949
I've lost everything,
all because an unbalanced woman

29:09.982 --> 29:12.118
couldn't deal with rejection
or a bad grade.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.385
Are you satisfied?

29:13.419 --> 29:14.520
We need to speak
with your daughter.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.088
No.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.523
(Stabler)
Why not?

29:17.556 --> 29:21.027
Because she's a minor,
and I won't allow it.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.161
Ron, if you've

29:22.194 --> 29:23.462
got nothing to hide,

29:23.495 --> 29:24.897
you should let us
speak to her.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.866
Either that,
or we ask her mother.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.506
Sophie...

29:34.540 --> 29:36.142
I understand you were in

29:36.175 --> 29:37.977
the City Arts library
this morning.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.979
Yes.
Why?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.484
I was working
on a science project.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.220
Is that all you did?

29:49.989 --> 29:51.157
(Sophie)
Yes.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.059
You see that?

29:53.092 --> 29:55.327
She looks to her dad
every time before she answers.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.497
Maybe she's just scared.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.999
When you were
at the library this morning,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.033
did you use
the computer?

30:03.903 --> 30:05.271
Yeah, but it was
for research.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.073
I didn't
do anything wrong.

30:07.106 --> 30:07.940
He's coaching her.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.978
Sophie, did you
write this e-mail?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.379
"Whore, liar.
Burn in hell.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.481
I hope you die, bitch."

30:17.549 --> 30:18.885
Answer the question.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.557
(Benson)
Sophie, answer the question!

30:25.591 --> 30:27.826
Did you send this e-mail?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.132
Look at it.
Did you sent this e-mail?

30:33.165 --> 30:36.235
Why don't you just
leave us alone!

30:36.268 --> 30:37.904
My dad didn't do anything,

30:37.937 --> 30:39.371
and you've
destroyed his life.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.240
All right, that's enough.
That's enough.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.474
You should be
talking to me, not her.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.243
You sent the e-mails.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.078
No, Sophie did, but...

30:46.112 --> 30:47.880
it's not her fault.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.416
She must have heard me
talking on the phone about Myra.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.119
She'd have seen
how upset I was.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.087
I'm responsible for this.
Not her.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.025
It's okay.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.431
Isn't he smart?

31:05.464 --> 31:07.333
He comes forward.
He says, "I did it."

31:07.366 --> 31:09.135
And we all think
he's a stand-up guy.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.003
Maybe that's what he is.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.972
He just manipulated
the hell out of his daughter,

31:13.005 --> 31:14.140
and he's manipulating us.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.441
The first time
that I saw him,

31:15.474 --> 31:17.343
he walked right up to me
and he said,

31:17.376 --> 31:21.080
"She's gonna say
I raped her."

31:21.113 --> 31:22.414
This guy's good.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.450
So now you don't
believe him?

31:24.483 --> 31:26.018
Grand jury came back.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.219
They just voted to indict
Ron Polikoff.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.487
Does Myra know?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.655
I'm on the way
to tell her now.

31:29.688 --> 31:30.622
You wanna come?

31:39.165 --> 31:40.299
[knock on door]

31:40.332 --> 31:42.268
Not in.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.469
Maybe she's on campus.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.077
Answer the door!

31:51.110 --> 31:52.478
Open up, damn it!

31:52.511 --> 31:54.213
Sir. Calm down.
She's not home.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.647
She better be.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.584
There's water pouring through
my bathroom ceiling.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.352
Damn kids
stay up all night--

32:00.386 --> 32:02.221
Sir, get out of my way!

32:05.691 --> 32:07.726
Myra!

32:07.759 --> 32:09.395
Myra!

32:09.428 --> 32:10.729
[water running]

32:10.762 --> 32:11.663
Over here!

32:19.705 --> 32:21.340
We got a pulse.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.408
We need an ambulance.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.475
46 Driggs Avenue,
Greenpoint.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.710
Apartment five.

32:24.743 --> 32:25.978
Sleeping pills!

32:26.012 --> 32:27.046
Attempted suicide.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.647
Drug overdose.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.227
How's Myra?

32:41.260 --> 32:44.130
She's okay.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.198
You know, I should have
seen how depressed she was.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.266
I should have
done something.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.269
Well, you did exactly
what she wanted.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.470
What are you
talking about?

32:51.503 --> 32:53.439
How long did it take you
to get to Brooklyn?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.241
45 minutes, maybe.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.109
After you left the office,
Myra called.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.011
She wanted to find out
about the grand jury decision.

32:59.045 --> 33:01.247
Munch told her that Polikoff
had been indicted...

33:01.280 --> 33:03.449
and that you were on your way
to go see her.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.085
She knew
that I was coming.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.157
[heavy breathing]

33:11.190 --> 33:12.758
Myra.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.230
You saved my life.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.366
What if I'd been stuck

33:20.399 --> 33:22.034
on the Williamsburg Bridge
for an hour?

33:22.068 --> 33:24.636
I don't understand.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.472
You made sure
that your tub

33:26.505 --> 33:28.574
would flood
the downstairs apartment.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.609
Your neighbor works from home.
You knew he'd be there.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.810
You're wrong.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.279
You called my office.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.780
You spoke with my colleague.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.416
He told you
that I was on my way.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.650
You weren't gonna die.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.525
Okay, I was taking a bath.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.527
And I couldn't stop crying.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.663
So I just took some pills
to make the pain go away.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.166
And it wasn't working,
so I took some more.

33:56.235 --> 33:59.171
And...

33:59.205 --> 34:01.773
I felt myself going,
but I just didn't care.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.077
'Cause I just
wanted to die.

34:05.111 --> 34:07.479
Why?

34:07.513 --> 34:10.682
Because I can't
do this anymore.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.651
The grand jury
was horrible,

34:12.684 --> 34:14.786
and court's just
gonna be worse.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.524
They're gonna make me relive
every horrible detail.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.326
And Ron,
all he has to do

34:20.359 --> 34:22.128
is say that I'm lying.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.097
And I can't prove a thing.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.769
But I'm not lying.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.738
He raped me.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.807
He raped me.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.650
(Novak)
After Mr. Polikoff told you
to leave his apartment,

34:44.683 --> 34:46.752
why didn't you
go to the police

34:46.785 --> 34:47.853
or to the hospital?

34:47.886 --> 34:49.388
I just wanted
to go home and hide.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.123
So you hailed a taxi.

34:51.157 --> 34:54.126
Right, and the cabbie
wouldn't take me to Brooklyn.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.795
And I lost it.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.897
So I threw a wine bottle
at his cab,

34:58.930 --> 35:00.732
and then that's when
the police showed up.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.401
And you told them
you'd been raped.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.769
Yeah, they were
the first people

35:03.802 --> 35:05.671
I felt safe to tell.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.905
Thank you.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.840
Ms. Denning, now that we
heard all the reasons

35:08.874 --> 35:10.342
why you didn't act
like a victim of rape--

35:10.376 --> 35:11.410
Your honor--

35:11.443 --> 35:13.712
Get to your question,
Ms. Emmett.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.148
Have you ever made
an allegation of sexual abuse

35:16.182 --> 35:17.383
against another man?

35:17.416 --> 35:18.517
No.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.752
No?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.388
Didn't you, on the night
of the alleged rape,

35:22.421 --> 35:24.290
accuse Detective Stabler

35:24.323 --> 35:26.658
of inappropriate
sexual behavior?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.598
I don't remember.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.899
Let me refresh your memory.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.701
Detective Stabler
gave you a ride home,

35:35.734 --> 35:37.569
helped you to your door.

35:37.603 --> 35:38.837
The next day you claimed

35:38.870 --> 35:41.307
that he had touched you
inappropriately.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.342
Correct?

35:43.375 --> 35:46.212
[whispering]
Yeah.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.247
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.448
Yes.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.649
A police officer

35:50.682 --> 35:54.420
with 12 years
of unblemished service

35:54.453 --> 35:56.288
helping the victims
of rape.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.889
He groped you?

36:00.292 --> 36:01.593
No.

36:01.627 --> 36:05.464
No?
So you made it up?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.499
I'm s--
I'm sorry.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.601
I was just confused,
and I was...

36:13.472 --> 36:14.773
I was in pain, and--

36:14.806 --> 36:17.243
Did you make it up?!

36:17.276 --> 36:19.345
Not at the time.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.679
And now?

36:24.783 --> 36:25.884
And now?

36:25.917 --> 36:28.887
Your honor,
the witness needs a break.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.556
You may step down,
Ms. Denning.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.624
10-minute recess.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.859
[gavel pounds]

36:49.007 --> 36:54.480
Finally, I'd like you
to search your soul.

36:54.513 --> 36:58.750
Did you do anything
that night that you regret?

36:58.784 --> 37:00.486
Yes.

37:00.519 --> 37:03.822
I regret inviting Myra
into my apartment.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.925
I regret drinking wine
with a student.

37:06.958 --> 37:11.330
I most regret having sex
with a troubled young woman.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.466
But I broke no laws.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.403
If you are looking
for a victim in this,

37:17.436 --> 37:19.338
it's me.

37:19.371 --> 37:22.608
Thank you.
No further questions.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.443
So you're
the victim here?

37:24.476 --> 37:25.944
That's right.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.846
You recognize
this photo?

37:29.615 --> 37:31.049
No.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.584
These are blowups
of the contusions

37:32.618 --> 37:33.485
on Myra's arms.

37:33.519 --> 37:35.020
Who did this to her?

37:35.053 --> 37:36.522
I did.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.656
But Myra asked me to.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.857
And this?

37:38.890 --> 37:40.959
Strangulation bruises
on Myra's neck.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.728
Did you do this, too?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.330
Do you have pictures
of my bruises, my bite marks?

37:44.363 --> 37:46.398
Answer the question,
Mr. Polikoff.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.066
Did you
make these marks?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.035
Yes.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.537
But Myra told me to,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.472
and when I wouldn't,
she--she--

37:53.505 --> 37:54.973
she scratched me so hard
she drew blood!

37:55.006 --> 37:56.408
You're about, what,

37:56.442 --> 37:58.744
six-foot-four,
200 pounds?

37:58.777 --> 38:01.613
Myra Denning
is maybe 115.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.816
You still want to claim
that you're the victim here?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.385
Yes.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.421
Because a woman forced you
to have sex with her?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.457
No, because it's my picture
in the paper, not hers.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.892
My daughter has had
to change schools.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.563
My wife is suing
for sole custody.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.598
I've lost my job.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.567
My life is a shambles.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.902
And all I can do is say
I did not rape her.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.372
I did not rape her!

38:32.511 --> 38:33.712
What do you think?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.113
I don't know.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.582
Glad I'm not on that jury.

38:36.615 --> 38:37.949
Me too.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.686
Guess we agree
on something.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.690
I saw this scared
and angry woman.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.458
Maybe I jumped the gun.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.594
Look, maybe I didn't
give Myra a fair shake.

38:48.627 --> 38:51.997
When I saw Polikoff
and his daughter...

38:52.030 --> 38:55.534
Wednesday nights
and every other weekend?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.736
That got to me.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.071
Elliot.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.009
What happened
with you and Kathy?

39:07.513 --> 39:09.915
Uh, the job.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.983
Makes me kind of
hard to live with.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.653
She should try
working with you.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.090
You okay?

39:21.627 --> 39:23.429
Novak called.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.996
Closing arguments.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.968
(Emmett)
The crime of rape

39:30.001 --> 39:32.538
used to be hard to prove.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.073
Even harder to convict.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.410
The victim was on trial,
not her rapist.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.945
Then the laws changed.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.013
Woman's identity
was protected,

39:42.047 --> 39:43.782
her sexual history
excluded,

39:43.815 --> 39:47.085
and rapists were rightly
brought to justice.

39:47.118 --> 39:51.990
Now, perhaps the pendulum
has swung too far.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.494
Women who have sex
and later regret it

39:55.527 --> 39:58.497
are not entitled
to call their partners rapists.

39:58.530 --> 40:01.066
Now, Ms. Denning went
to my client's apartment

40:01.099 --> 40:03.802
late at night,
wore sexy clothes,

40:03.835 --> 40:07.673
drank several glasses of wine,
and then kissed him.

40:07.706 --> 40:12.444
But now she says she was there
to discuss her art portfolio.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.646
Now, every piece of evidence
is open to interpretation.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.148
But two facts
are undeniable.

40:17.182 --> 40:22.087
First, there is nothing
in Ron Polikoff's past

40:22.120 --> 40:24.490
to suggest he is capable
of such a violent act.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.625
Second, his life
has already been ruined

40:26.658 --> 40:30.629
by this woman's unfounded,
unsubstantiated,

40:30.662 --> 40:33.532
and unjust accusations.

40:33.565 --> 40:37.002
Don't punish him any more
for a crime he did not commit.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.207
Believe me, rape
is still hard to prosecute,

40:42.240 --> 40:45.010
and it is still
a nightmare for the victims.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.778
Ms. Denning
has had to endure

40:46.812 --> 40:50.115
three separate
sexual humiliations.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.216
Her teacher,
a man she admired,

40:51.249 --> 40:52.518
raped her.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.819
In the hospital,

40:53.852 --> 40:55.020
she had to strip naked,

40:55.053 --> 40:56.988
she was photographed,

40:57.022 --> 40:59.090
poked, prodded,
and then scraped,

40:59.124 --> 41:01.259
so the police
could gather evidence.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.829
And finally,
she sat here and relived

41:03.862 --> 41:06.832
every sordid,
painful detail.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.233
Her sex life dissected.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.202
Her psychological traumas
exposed.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.906
Her entire motivation
called into question.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.508
So ask yourselves this:

41:20.278 --> 41:22.981
Why would she put herself
through such hell

41:23.014 --> 41:26.051
if she wasn't
telling the truth?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.989
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

41:32.323 --> 41:34.059
We have, your honor.

41:52.177 --> 41:55.981
In the case of The People
versus Ronald J. Polikoff,

41:56.014 --> 41:59.184
docket ending 445,

41:59.217 --> 42:01.252
on the top count
of the indictment,

42:01.286 --> 42:03.188
the charge of rape
in the first degree,

42:03.221 --> 42:05.591
what is your verdict?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.528
We find the defendant...

42:42.193 --> 42:44.630
[wolf howling]
