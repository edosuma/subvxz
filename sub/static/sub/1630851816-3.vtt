ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:47.964 --> 00:50.175
SEPTEMBER 30, 1987

00:59.434 --> 01:02.479
SCHOOL MAGAZINE CLUB ROOM

01:03.605 --> 01:05.523
We got so many letters.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.567
They piled up over the summer.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.029
There's also a package.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.490
Are some of the letters
not from our school students?

01:13.573 --> 01:16.034
That's what I heard.
We got letters from other schools.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.579
This is really something.
Our magazine is pretty good.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.458
Hey, Yong-tak.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.877
Come and help sort this out.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.588
Jung-hyun,
why did you bring him with you?

01:28.671 --> 01:30.924
I give him points
for not missing a club meeting.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.516
We have three letters
about a red mask sighting.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.476
Don't they all describe the same thing?

01:41.559 --> 01:43.186
They saw some guy on a side street.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.231
How will we approach it?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.858
Will he appear if we do a stakeout there?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.694
Yes. I heard he attacks
pretty girls or ugly guys.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.405
Then we should go.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.366
What are you talking about? Idiot.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.371
The second most mentioned topic was
a haunted house in Hyegang-dong.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.707
I like that one.
We'll be able to get nice pictures.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.128
Let's think a bit more about that

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
since Chuseok is coming up next week.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.966
Let's pick one for
our special report later.

02:14.509 --> 02:18.638
I don't think we can top
the Seven Secret Spots story we did.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.598
What is this?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.145
This came in a package too?

02:25.228 --> 02:27.856
Oh, I forgot. That came too.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.152
But we can't watch it
since we don't have a VCR player.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.280
Mixtape… What does that mean?

02:37.198 --> 02:39.159
I think it's a recorded tape.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.578
-What kind of recording?
-How would I know?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.747
Is there a way we can watch this?

02:46.416 --> 02:47.834
Maybe I can ask the broadcasting club.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.462
Oh, I know how we can watch it.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.009
Wake up, Yong-tak.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.138
It smells.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.472
What is this stink?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.141
It's assaulting my nose.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.769
Lock the door
after you finish watching it.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.479
-Sure.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.773
-Did you hear what the coach said?
-About what?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.192
He said he'll hold practice
even during Chuseok.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.360
Really? Damn it.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.154
-That sucks.
-Sucks.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.197
Anyway, make sure you lock the door.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.158
Bye.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.172
What is this? It's so noisy.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.548
Turn down the volume.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.062
-Did you listen to it?
-What?

04:34.649 --> 04:36.442
The cassette tape, you mean?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.112
Sir, I think…

04:39.195 --> 04:40.154
Stop.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.949
Don't say anything yet.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.660
I Just wanted to know
if you listened to it.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.163
We have to think now. Whatever that is,

04:50.748 --> 04:52.125
we need to think.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.507
Oh gosh.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.177
Why are you sitting like that
when there are customers around?

05:03.261 --> 05:04.387
Geez.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.807
Scoop the rice by yourself.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.934
-Okay.
-Don't eat too much though.

05:10.018 --> 05:10.935
Come on!

05:15.440 --> 05:16.357
And

05:17.066 --> 05:19.444
give this to Jae-young's mom.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.823
I heard she closed her shop. She's busy
searching for Jae-young everywhere.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.200
Pickled radish is good
when you need a quick meal.

05:26.909 --> 05:27.952
It'll be awkward.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.412
Why would it be awkward?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.165
Because Jae-young isn't there.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.249
Oh gosh.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.626
You're so immature.
Aren't you worried about her?

05:36.627 --> 05:37.879
You need to grow up.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.673
-Could I have some water?
-Coming.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.218
<i>There have been a string of homicides
in Saju, Gyeongsangnam-do.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:47.388
<i>Lee Kyung-jin,
who went missing on July 13,</i>

05:47.472 --> 05:49.140
<i>has been found dead.</i>

05:49.807 --> 05:52.643
<i>Meanwhile, Jo Jae-young,
who went missing on July 15,</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:56.064
<i>is actually the daughter of Jo Kyung-ho,</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:58.441
<i>the terrorist
behind the nerve gas attack in 1987.</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:00.318
-What did he just say?
-<i>According to reports,</i>

06:00.401 --> 06:03.154
<i>Ms. Jo and her family
hid the fact from their neighbors.</i>

06:03.237 --> 06:05.490
-What did he say?
-<i>The family left Saju</i>

06:05.573 --> 06:08.785
<i>-after the attack and lived in Incheon…</i>
-Did you know that?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.371
Did you know
she was the daughter of that bastard?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.706
I'm done eating.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.958
Where do you think you're going?
Come back here.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.295
<i>The police are looking for Kim
who is the kidnapping suspect.</i>

06:19.378 --> 06:21.881
DECEASED JUNG YOUNG-SEOB

06:43.319 --> 06:44.612
Thank you for coming.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.534
Thank you.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.792
I don't see anyone I know.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.711
It's been a while since we last saw him.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.671
Min-jae.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.297
Yes?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.425
-How about we leave now?
-Already?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.468
Sorry.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.304
I'm worried about so much stuff right now.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.228
There was a symbol I saw
in the school magazine,

07:17.311 --> 07:20.022
and I recall
it was from that mysterious place.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.484
It's the same symbol I saw in the home
of the guy who kidnapped Jae-young.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.486
To be honest,

07:26.696 --> 07:29.407
I was looking for
our high school friends here.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.743
I wanted to ask them
if they knew anything about it

07:34.495 --> 07:35.997
or ever saw it.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.250
Oh gosh.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.919
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.215
Anyway,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.051
I don't think it's the right thing to do.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.139
It's disrespectful to Young-seob too.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.309
Sure. I'm not judging you.
So don't worry about me.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.644
If you want to leave,
then we can leave now.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.648
Excuse me.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.444
Thank you for coming.
I'm Young-seob's cousin.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.946
Oh, you are? It must be hard for you.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.949
We went to the same high school as him.
He was a friend.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.494
I see. Aunt told me you were his friends.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.704
Would you like me to bring you some food?

08:16.787 --> 08:18.498
Oh, we're fine. Don't mind us.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.584
I'm sorry. We should be helping
with the funeral.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.253
Oh, that's okay. We have enough help.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.298
Were you close with Young-seob?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.677
You could say that.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.514
We were in the same club in high school.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.559
In that case, could you
stay here a little longer?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
I have a favor to ask from you.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.616
I could just bring it to you.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.700
I know, right?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.744
Are you sure about this?

08:57.411 --> 08:59.580
No, I've always wanted to see his place.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.125
After we get there,
I'll give you a ride home afterward.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.419
That would be great.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.227
That's his room.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.363
I was going to go through his photos

09:32.446 --> 09:34.740
and hold a posthumous photo exhibit
in his memory.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.244
So that's what I'm trying to organize.
But I don't know much about photos,

09:38.995 --> 09:41.706
so I was hoping
you could pick out the best ones.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.959
We're not experts in photography.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.837
Even if you're not, you were close to him.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.715
So you probably have a better idea
of what photos

09:50.798 --> 09:52.633
he would have wanted to show people.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.094
Let me see.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.971
There are more photos in this box.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.728
-Jung-hyun.
-What?

10:03.811 --> 10:05.062
Take a look at this.

10:07.315 --> 10:11.193
Amazing. He didn't throw anything out.
He kept these old photos.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.821
I know.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.991
I totally forgot
that we took these photos.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.330
What is this?

10:23.956 --> 10:24.999
It's a VCR tape.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.294
Jung-hyun, don't you remember
seeing this tape before?

10:30.671 --> 10:33.341
Is there a VCR player in the house?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.551
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.347
Young-seob's family hardly watch any TV.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.726
Then could we borrow this?

10:43.809 --> 10:44.977
What?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.356
Well…

10:50.107 --> 10:51.984
I'm not the person you should be asking.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.986
Why do you need it?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.363
What's gotten into you?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.198
Please let me borrow it.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.760
Yes, Master Jung.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.222
Nobody is here yet.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.350
Oh, is that so?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.310
Right.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.561
It's okay.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.399
Well,

11:32.191 --> 11:33.401
it's just that

11:34.777 --> 11:37.154
I feel a bit disappointed, okay?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.699
I'm not asking a lot in return.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.786
I made what you could call
a noble sacrifice

11:44.328 --> 11:47.289
for our brothers, you know.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.793
But the way I'm being treated is
a bit disappointing.

11:51.919 --> 11:56.257
Who takes a ferry to travel to Japan?

11:56.757 --> 12:00.761
It's raining a lot here.
I'm not even sure if the ferry can depart.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.856
No, sir.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.610
You're the representative.
I'm not complaining about your decisions.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.780
Okay.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.118
Hello.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.662
Hello.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.957
I'm…

12:31.417 --> 12:32.668
the Successor.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.336
I'm the Successor.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.238
Mr. Lee.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.783
Oh, great to see you.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.619
We arrived late.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.997
I knew you wouldn't be a no-show,
but I was getting worried.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.708
I was starting to feel a bit lonely.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.376
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.004
We had something to give you

13:17.087 --> 13:19.798
to take with you on your trip.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.425
Is that so? What is it?

13:21.509 --> 13:23.260
Let's have a look at it.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.642
There's no need to. It won't take long.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.165
Master,

13:54.041 --> 13:56.794
I sincerely wish you'll attain nirvana.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.354
Mom, I'm home.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.695
Mom.

14:24.655 --> 14:25.739
Mom.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.297
Are you okay?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.262
What was that sound?

16:53.929 --> 16:55.556
I don't know. Someone threw a rock.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.855
Mom, go to your room.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.442
-What is going on?
-Hurry.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.073
Mom.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.327
Mom. What will we do?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.205
Mom.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.266
I had a relatively normal childhood

17:40.934 --> 17:42.853
while growing up.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.859
My mother raised me
and my sister by herself.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.489
Not much stands out in my memory.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.868
I had an ordinary life, I guess.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.790
Could you tell me why you went to Japan?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.335
There was someone I had to meet.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.130
Could you tell us who that person was?

18:13.342 --> 18:14.635
I don't know.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.763
Why are you smiling?

18:18.472 --> 18:19.515
Oh, sorry.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.391
It's just that

18:22.142 --> 18:25.354
this conversation we're having
is very amusing.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.231
It's amusing to you?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.566
Which part of it?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.194
I went to Japan
to meet the mother of my child.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.781
Is Jae-young's mother Japanese?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.118
No, she's not.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.745
Is that what you thought?

18:45.707 --> 18:47.376
I guess you could.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.604
-Sir.
-You're here.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.273
What are you doing?

19:09.356 --> 19:10.899
Looking at the seagulls.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.693
Seagulls?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.862
I don't see any. It's raining.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.365
I was thinking about them.
They're gone because it's raining.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.117
It's nice when it doesn't rain.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.536
They fly right at me to eat this
from my hand.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.875
How's work? Are you holding up well?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.753
It's been over ten years
since I've been stationed here.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.672
It's been that long?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.593
Back when I was in Seoul,

19:38.260 --> 19:41.054
I would wonder whether
you were doing your job well down here.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.723
You always say that.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.934
It was great when we worked together
at headquarters in Namsan.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.227
Don't you think so?

19:48.103 --> 19:50.147
You probably don't remember.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.067
-Is everything the same?
-What?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.696
You don't think about it?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.033
Sir.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.493
I already told you about how I feel.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.997
I'm just asking. Don't get upset.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.376
Let's go, sir.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.420
They cleared the area of the murder scene.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.380
-Let's go.
-Okay.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.973
-Is this the person you were looking for?
-It is.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.810
Did you find anything?

20:29.686 --> 20:32.522
No, no belongings and no wallet.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.191
Somebody took everything.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.692
How did you identify him then?

20:36.276 --> 20:39.529
His business card was lying there.
I think the killers didn't see that.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.493
He was carrying yen. So I think
he was planning to go to Japan.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.786
You're right.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.372
And it's very sloppy.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.177
Was this inside his bag?

21:02.886 --> 21:03.720
Yes, it was.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.556
He liked sweets a lot.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.725
Sweets?

21:09.685 --> 21:10.978
Where did I see this before?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.272
You've seen that before?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.108
Isn't that a Japanese candy?

21:28.453 --> 21:29.454
Lee Kyung-jin.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.915
I think I saw it in Kyung-jin's room.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.131
Oh, sir. Why did you put it in your mouth?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.974
-Go and check the ingredients of it.
-Why?

21:49.057 --> 21:52.060
He was acting like a drug dealer.
Remember?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.938
Oh, I think he was.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.899
This wasn't a simple homicide case
from the beginning.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.652
We made a mistake from there.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.911
Could you tell me about
the circumstances at the time?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.460
We discovered Japanese candy
next to his body.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.130
It was among his belongings.

22:21.590 --> 22:25.093
And it was the same candy I found
in the first victim, Kyung-jin's room.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.971
We had the candy tested.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.515
It was LSD-laced candy.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.103
It was a hugely popular candy
in the 1990s.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.523
It's a hallucinogenic drug.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.737
Afterward, we found
large amounts of LSD-laced

22:43.820 --> 22:45.947
candy in Lee Young-deok's home.

22:47.157 --> 22:50.160
LSD is smuggled into Korea from Japan.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.372
There are only a few crime syndicates
that can smuggle that much LSD.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.667
So it wasn't hard to track down the gang.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.880
Lee Young-deok was involved

23:01.963 --> 23:03.465
-with the Skull Gang?
-Yes.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.759
There has to be a connection

23:05.842 --> 23:09.179
between Kyung-jin
and the missing girl, Jae-young.

23:09.763 --> 23:14.392
Also, Lee Young-deok and Kyung-jin
probably knew each other, right?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.812
-Yes, Chief.
-So give me your take on this.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.397
Why would the Skull Gang
kidnap Jae-young, then?

23:20.107 --> 23:22.442
We're not completely sure about that.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.487
We're just looking at every clue we find.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.530
No.

23:26.613 --> 23:29.032
You can't make assumptions
based on one clue.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.033
There is

23:30.659 --> 23:32.577
-something else.
-Something?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.871
There's something we're not seeing here.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.583
And whatever it is,
it's the reason behind all these incidents

23:39.709 --> 23:41.211
that are happening in our city.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.379
Give it to me straight.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.881
What is it?
Are you telling me there's a ringleader?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.092
That could be the case.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.720
Or a crime syndicate could be involved.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.814
You've heard
that a special investigation unit

24:01.481 --> 24:03.441
may take over these cases, right?

24:05.610 --> 24:08.071
-Yes, I've heard the rumor.
-If that were to happen,

24:08.155 --> 24:10.073
you have to switch loyalties
and toe the line.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.534
Geez, you keep saying that.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.327
You don't get it.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.204
You haven't had any breakthroughs yet.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.206
Even if Lee Young-deok is a drug dealer

24:18.290 --> 24:21.376
and he's involved with the Skull Gang,

24:21.459 --> 24:23.003
what are you getting yourselves into now?

24:23.086 --> 24:27.132
If you can't connect the drugs
to the disappearance of Jae-young,

24:27.215 --> 24:30.177
then you'll have a serious career setback.
Understand?

24:33.388 --> 24:34.764
Chief, that's exactly why

24:35.473 --> 24:37.809
we're asking you for a favor.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.686
I'll ask you one last time.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.148
Do you really need this to crack the case?

24:45.108 --> 24:46.693
Yes, we do.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.405
Let's work the case
with Busan anti-narcotics division.

24:51.072 --> 24:53.241
That's a good cover.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.536
Let the anti-narcotics division
handle the Skull Gang.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.413
You two just do your job and come back.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.542
Bring back a single hair belonging
to Jae-young if you can, okay?

25:53.343 --> 25:54.594
Mr. Kang.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.222
I borrowed three million won,

25:58.139 --> 26:00.642
but why is the principal five million won?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.143
That's not right.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.146
No, you're mistaken, ma'am.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.190
Let's look at the numbers.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.568
Before we gave you the loan,

26:11.236 --> 26:13.989
we thoroughly explained
the interest rate to you.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.490
You know that, right?

26:15.573 --> 26:18.034
The pre-interest is 1.5 million won
and our loan fee is 500,000 won.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.870
The interest you pay is 50 percent
for 10 days. That's 150,000 won.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.580
All of that is written down
in the promissory note.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.667
The interest I'm paying is ridiculous.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.461
The deal you put your money in

26:28.545 --> 26:31.506
is the Jungang Market deal, right?
The Busan Gang set that up.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.258
How did you know?

26:33.341 --> 26:35.719
A lot of my customers
have put their money in it.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.972
And a lot of dumb investors
have piled in too.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.599
-I heard the deal had some hiccups.
-That's what I'm saying.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.227
The timing is perfect.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.396
But I don't have money
to get into the action.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.732
I haven't gotten the rebound I need.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.403
So you're saying
the timing is great, right?

26:53.486 --> 26:57.073
If you time it well, will you be able to
pay back the loan?

26:57.157 --> 26:59.701
Of course, Mr. Kang.
No problem whatsoever.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.495
YONGMA FAST CASH
CEO KANG YONG-TAK

27:02.579 --> 27:03.955
How about we do this?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.418
I'll lower the interest rate
to 30 percent.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.253
If you pay back the loan
in full a day later,

27:10.337 --> 27:12.797
I'll offer you our special
loan product No. 13.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.759
Could you really do that?

27:16.426 --> 27:19.387
I would never offer this to anyone
unless we had strong trust.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.016
Come on. If you ride a wave well,

27:23.099 --> 27:25.935
it can even sink a ship. It's unstoppable.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.062
Sure.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.648
-You need to make some profits.
-Sure.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.193
If you sign that,
I'll give you the loan right now.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.529
I've never offered this
financial product before,

27:36.613 --> 27:38.114
so I'll lend you
up to three million won for now.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.577
I took out 900,000 won as pre-interest.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.580
It's 2.1 million won then.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.710
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.254
I'll see you tomorrow.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.632
Have this refreshment.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.674
Thank you.

28:02.430 --> 28:03.515
Boss.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.810
-Will she be all right?
-What do you mean?

28:06.893 --> 28:09.312
-I think the deal is fizzling already.
-Right?

28:09.396 --> 28:10.980
It's not going to rebound, right?

28:11.064 --> 28:12.315
No.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.192
But…

28:15.276 --> 28:17.028
even though she's been losing money,

28:17.987 --> 28:21.699
she still owns an apartment. She shares
the title to it with her husband.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.495
What about her husband though?
He won't take it well.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.998
He'll have to cover his wife's debts
or we'll threaten to tell his employer.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.459
She won't be able to repay it all anyway.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.753
She owes us 300 million won.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.505
She'll keep borrowing more from us

28:35.588 --> 28:38.425
and then we'll take their apartment.
That'll be a big blow.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.635
When you take them to the cleaners,

28:40.719 --> 28:43.138
you take them for
every dime they're worth.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.140
-Understand?
-Yes.

28:45.765 --> 28:46.891
Call in the next customer.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.438
Come in, Ma'am.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.197
You're Yong-tak, right?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.325
Do you remember me?

29:24.179 --> 29:26.556
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

29:36.983 --> 29:39.027
What a mess.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.112
Well…

29:42.447 --> 29:46.117
Some people threw rocks
and broke the windows last night.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.745
-Who did?
-She doesn't know.

29:52.248 --> 29:55.585
But I don't know what's going on.
Ask Jung-hyun.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.260
Gosh, this is pretty bad.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.595
Are they crazy or what?

30:06.387 --> 30:08.515
Jung-hyun, are you inside?

30:21.736 --> 30:24.656
She said she would be home.
Where did she go?

30:29.035 --> 30:30.411
Hey, where were you?

30:32.121 --> 30:33.581
I went out to buy something to drink.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.878
It's been a while. Hi Yong-tak.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.339
So it is.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.591
Long time no see, Jung-hyun.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.931
Tell me when you're done.

30:57.772 --> 30:58.773
Are you ready?

31:01.401 --> 31:04.112
Let me ask you something first.

31:05.989 --> 31:06.865
Okay.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.702
Why do I have to watch this?
I haven't seen you for ten years.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.204
I'm sorry for asking you.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.873
I'm pretty desperate.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.167
I'm not upset or anything.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.547
I'm just wondering
why I have to watch the tape.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.511
We've already watched
this videotape before.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.388
-And?
-That's the reason.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.663
-What did you feel?
-Well…

32:37.622 --> 32:39.749
I remember watching it together.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.709
But

32:43.336 --> 32:45.463
I totally forgot
that it contained that stuff.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.133
Just as I expected.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.385
What did you feel?

32:51.427 --> 32:52.512
Did you remember it?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.098
No.

32:55.848 --> 32:58.142
I couldn't remember a thing.
Neither could Min-jae.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.895
How is it possible?

33:01.521 --> 33:03.439
Even if we saw it ten years ago,

33:04.357 --> 33:05.608
how could we forget

33:06.567 --> 33:08.277
what we saw in the video?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.863
What do you really want to know?

33:11.447 --> 33:15.201
-What?
-Why is this so important to you?

33:17.745 --> 33:20.873
Is it related to
your niece's disappearance?

33:25.503 --> 33:26.921
I don't know. It's just…

33:28.297 --> 33:30.758
I don't believe her disappearance
is some random crime.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.220
There's something I'm not remembering

33:35.471 --> 33:36.597
and I think…

33:38.307 --> 33:40.143
that is connected to something

33:40.977 --> 33:42.979
that happened to us a long time ago.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.649
I envy you.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.694
You go on with life without caring.

33:51.362 --> 33:55.908
When you moved away
ten years ago without telling anyone,

33:56.784 --> 34:00.329
I thought I had done something
wrong that had upset you.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.250
Otherwise, why would you not call
me for all those years?

34:07.211 --> 34:08.755
But now I understand.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.798
That's

34:11.758 --> 34:13.009
your personality.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.430
You only care about
what's important to you.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.514
So

34:19.223 --> 34:20.850
I became to hate you

34:20.933 --> 34:23.686
more than your terrorist brother
who killed all those people.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.606
How could you not say a word to me

34:26.689 --> 34:28.775
just because you wanted to start
a new life somewhere else?

34:28.858 --> 34:30.276
Damn it.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.323
How could you not even call me once?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.742
Even though the whole town
knows you're back now.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.705
Yong-tak.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.628
Jung-hyun.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.675
I'm kidding with you.

35:01.182 --> 35:05.019
Everybody looks out for themselves.
It's how people are. We're selfish.

35:06.187 --> 35:10.108
Well, I'm really busy
because of our seasonal business.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.734
I can't stay any longer.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.447
Yong-tak.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.325
I had fun. Not bad for a reunion

35:20.076 --> 35:21.160
in ten years.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.481
SUNGSHIN MUSIC ACADEMY

36:04.453 --> 36:08.207
<i>Your eyes meet mine</i>

36:08.291 --> 36:11.961
<i>What could it mean?</i>

36:12.044 --> 36:13.796
<i>I don't know yet</i>

36:13.880 --> 36:16.048
<i>I really don’t know</i>

36:16.132 --> 36:19.135
<i>My heart just beats fast…</i>

36:21.637 --> 36:23.181
Who is she?

36:23.264 --> 36:24.182
Oh, she's…

36:26.058 --> 36:28.144
Hey, you're leaving smudges on the glass.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.026
Hey.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.654
Who drinks medicinal tonic like you?
You're drinking it as if it's beef soup.

36:38.738 --> 36:39.822
Isn't it bitter?

36:43.075 --> 36:44.744
Why are you learning
to sing country songs?

36:44.827 --> 36:45.995
I like ballad songs.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.540
We're becoming an aging society,
don't you know?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.709
-And so?
-You don't know?

36:52.293 --> 36:55.421
In a capitalist country,
you have to follow the money.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.840
Where is the money flowing?

36:59.383 --> 37:01.886
-To banks?
-The elderly will have all the money.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.095
Really?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.932
My grandma doesn't have any money.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.809
I'll give your grandma
an allowance when I earn money.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.520
Never mind that. Why did you come here?

37:14.023 --> 37:15.316
Are you done drinking that?

37:17.985 --> 37:19.237
I'll drink the rest later.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.947
-Why?
-Because it's too hot.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.910
Well, the thing is…

37:26.619 --> 37:29.163
I haven't been telling the truth.

37:29.914 --> 37:30.873
What is it?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.459
-Will you get mad after I tell you?
-Let me hear it first.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.296
Well, actually…

37:38.881 --> 37:40.841
I have that cassette tape.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.343
What tape?

37:42.927 --> 37:46.055
The tape someone delivered
to the broadcasting room that day.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.975
The broadcasting room?

37:51.102 --> 37:53.437
What? Have you gone mad?

37:54.397 --> 37:55.731
Lower your voice.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.317
Did you lie to the police?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.861
-You said you wouldn't get mad.
-I didn't say that.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.905
-You did, too.
-No, I didn't.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.535
If you're going to stay mad,
I'm going to go home.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.580
-Hey.
-Jae-young gave the tape to me.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.417
Is something going on?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.877
Why were you shouting?
That'll hurt your vocal cords.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.630
Oh, no…

38:19.714 --> 38:21.924
She kept asking me
to go to the Crocodile snack shop.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.428
Let's change the subject, okay?

38:25.511 --> 38:26.345
Okay.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.933
Mom, can I go to the <i>tteokbokki</i> shop?
I need 1,000 won.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.311
Don't eat anything spicy.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.146
-It could hurt your vocal cords.
-Okay.

38:38.107 --> 38:41.944
CROCODILE SNACK SHOP

38:44.780 --> 38:45.656
I'm full.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.367
I'm sweating after eating the spicy dish.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.994
My tummy hurts.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.788
-Now start talking.
-Talk about what?

38:52.872 --> 38:54.790
About what's going on.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.127
I told you everything earlier. That's it.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.506
Jae-young gave me the tape.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.467
-When?
-Well…

39:05.593 --> 39:07.011
Wednesday night.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.805
On Wednesday?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.141
That's one day before she went missing.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.143
Right.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.687
That night…

39:34.705 --> 39:35.790
Oh, Jae-young…

39:40.669 --> 39:41.670
Hey, Jae-young.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.258
What are you doing?
You're going to crack my window.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.887
-What are you doing?
-Just call me instead.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.972
This is more romantic, isn't it?

39:56.602 --> 39:58.020
You're crazy.

40:00.815 --> 40:01.899
Come in.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.528
-No, I just came to give you something.
-Give me what?

40:07.988 --> 40:09.740
Should I give it to you?

40:11.826 --> 40:12.993
Let me have it.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.752
Moon-sook.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.214
Among your friends, where do I fit it?

40:27.550 --> 40:29.927
What do you mean?
That's an awkward question.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.096
It's important to me.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.308
-Where do I come in?
-Well, right now…

40:37.852 --> 40:39.186
You're my best friend.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.106
-For real?
-Yes, for real.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.652
Okay.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.529
Thanks.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.077
<i>And she told me</i>

40:55.786 --> 40:57.496
not tell anyone about that

40:58.122 --> 41:00.124
until she called me.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.420
But I've told you.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.506
I'm really

41:08.466 --> 41:10.134
worried about her.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.596
She doesn't have a phone with her.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.806
Do you think

41:16.765 --> 41:18.100
she memorized my number?

41:19.894 --> 41:20.853
Are you crying?

41:20.936 --> 41:23.230
It's this <i>tteokbokki</i>.
It's really spicy, you know.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.524
Damn chili peppers.

41:30.237 --> 41:34.074
I won't tell anyone
so don't worry about that.

41:34.742 --> 41:37.620
No, let's tell Seung-hyun.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.749
I didn't want to tell her
because she has a big mouth.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.960
But if don't tell her,
then it would be a betrayal.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.170
Do what you want.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.216
I miss Jae-young.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.092
Me too.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.515
Where is she?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.558
I miss you, Jae-young.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.935
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

43:07.501 --> 43:08.752
Who is it?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.007
Hello.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:14.633 --> 43:16.552
I didn't think you'd be here at this hour.

43:23.642 --> 43:24.810
Thank you.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.771
I didn't mean to bother you like this.

43:28.397 --> 43:29.857
Thank you for coming.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.067
I know you're busy working
on Jae-young's case.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.365
Detective Kim told me
what's been happening.

43:39.783 --> 43:40.993
I heard it's tough

43:41.869 --> 43:43.454
to find the people
who smashed your windows.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.917
Whoever did it is among my neighbors.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.128
So finding them doesn't serve any purpose.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.591
I'm used to this. It happens all the time.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.343
We're scorned

43:58.135 --> 44:00.137
wherever we go.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.435
I'm sorry I can't help much.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.397
I'm sorry too.
I didn't need to mention this to you.

44:11.273 --> 44:14.735
I should be showing my gratitude
that you're searching for my niece.

44:14.818 --> 44:15.778
It's all right.

44:16.278 --> 44:20.032
I should be showing some progress but…

44:29.792 --> 44:32.294
Detective Choi,
this is your hometown too, right?

44:32.920 --> 44:34.004
No.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.590
Incheon is my hometown.

44:37.716 --> 44:40.969
You use the local dialect,
so I assumed you were from here.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.890
I've lived here for many years.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.850
I can't blend in

44:47.851 --> 44:49.895
if I speak with a different accent.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.483
Then how did you settle down here?

44:58.695 --> 45:00.155
My wife is from here.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.825
She wanted to move back to her hometown.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.868
So we came.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.622
That's a nice story.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.459
Jung-hyun,
is this your family's hometown?

45:13.836 --> 45:16.213
Yes, you could say that.

45:16.296 --> 45:19.341
Both of my parents
lived here all their lives.

45:22.845 --> 45:24.012
Actually,

45:26.473 --> 45:28.809
I don't know
where that bastard and I were born.

45:31.728 --> 45:33.355
I don't remember,

45:34.231 --> 45:37.526
but I was told that
we lived at an orphanage.

45:38.652 --> 45:42.072
Our foster parents
adopted us both at the same time.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.283
I see.

45:45.534 --> 45:48.036
-I didn't know.
-Only a few people know.

45:49.121 --> 45:53.292
The newspapers and news show
never mentioned that

45:54.835 --> 45:57.045
about that crazy bastard.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.174
That's peculiar.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.136
It's a fact that people would latch on.

46:05.971 --> 46:09.600
I'm surprised that
it hasn't been reported anywhere.

46:11.393 --> 46:12.519
I see.

46:14.938 --> 46:17.858
Now that I think of it,
I haven't met your dad yet.

46:18.942 --> 46:19.943
He passed away.

46:21.403 --> 46:23.280
He died in 1985.

46:24.406 --> 46:27.075
-So that's 15 years ago.
-I see.

46:27.784 --> 46:29.620
I'm sorry for mentioning that.

46:29.703 --> 46:32.956
Oh, no. I was the one
who mentioned him first.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.836
I think…

46:41.340 --> 46:43.008
I'm very stressed.

46:45.928 --> 46:48.055
I usually don't bring this up.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.147
Detective Choi, talking to you

46:58.690 --> 47:00.275
makes me think this.

47:04.446 --> 47:07.908
People involved with me or that bastard

47:10.536 --> 47:12.871
always meet an unfortunate end.

47:14.873 --> 47:17.000
Regardless of whether they're innocent…

47:18.961 --> 47:19.962
No.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.173
It's not just those who haven't sinned.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.469
Even really nice people, like Jae-young…

47:29.471 --> 47:30.556
This happens

47:31.598 --> 47:33.183
not only to evil guys,

47:35.394 --> 47:37.062
but also to someone like Jae-young

47:39.648 --> 47:41.483
who is much nicer than I am.

47:45.779 --> 47:47.239
That just occurred to me

47:49.575 --> 47:51.368
while talking to you, Detective Choi.

48:31.366 --> 48:32.409
Good morning.

48:34.161 --> 48:37.039
-Who are you?
-Oh, Detective Lee is my husband.

48:37.122 --> 48:40.083
He told me you were parked outside.
I thought I'd drop by to say hi.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.835
Oh, I'm so sorry.

48:47.382 --> 48:49.509
Have you gotten any sleep?

48:51.136 --> 48:52.638
My husband got up to leave,

48:52.721 --> 48:56.224
but I told him to take a shower first
because he stank.

48:56.308 --> 48:57.517
Oh, I see.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.102
He'll be coming down soon.

48:59.811 --> 49:02.939
So I came to tell you that
and also introduce myself.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.858
I'm sorry for coming so early.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.195
Have this for breakfast.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.321
Oh gosh.

49:10.155 --> 49:12.949
You don't have to share it
with my husband even if he asks.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.327
-He already had breakfast.
-I see.

49:15.911 --> 49:19.289
Thanks for the food every day.
I should've come to thank you sooner.

49:19.373 --> 49:20.457
It's fine.

49:20.957 --> 49:22.793
I try to make it tasty.

49:22.876 --> 49:24.419
I hope it suits your tastes.

49:31.510 --> 49:34.096
I'm sorry for asking this,

49:34.721 --> 49:36.640
but is something happening today?

49:37.307 --> 49:39.142
What? I don't understand.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.727
Well, you see…

49:41.520 --> 49:43.355
My husband seemed to be more nervous

49:44.564 --> 49:46.900
that he usually is this morning.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.737
I was wondering if he's handling
a dangerous case today.

49:50.821 --> 49:51.905
I'm kind of worried.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.787
You don’t have to worry.
There's nothing happening. He'll be okay.

49:59.454 --> 50:01.832
I'm sorry for bringing that up
in the morning.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.460
I feel much better now.

50:15.387 --> 50:16.680
Do you have a cigarette?

50:17.180 --> 50:18.181
Sure.

50:23.061 --> 50:24.688
Oh, I'm so forgetful.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.191
I didn't bring my cigarette with me.
Let's buy some on the way.

50:29.568 --> 50:30.610
Are you feeling okay?

50:32.320 --> 50:34.322
I get nervous sometimes, don't I?

50:35.073 --> 50:37.451
But my nerves will calm down in a minute.

50:39.953 --> 50:43.540
Your wife came down to talk to me
in the morning.

50:43.623 --> 50:44.750
What?

50:45.959 --> 50:49.045
Oh, she told me
she was throwing out the garbage.

50:49.963 --> 50:51.631
She cares a lot about you.

50:53.049 --> 50:54.926
Yes, that's true.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.597
-So today…
-Go ahead, sir.

50:59.848 --> 51:02.267
We're not going there to fight gangsters.

51:03.143 --> 51:05.395
We're just going to
focus on doing our job.

51:06.521 --> 51:08.565
So try to relax

51:09.649 --> 51:11.443
for the sake of your wife, okay?

51:12.319 --> 51:13.403
Okay.

51:33.381 --> 51:36.635
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

52:15.382 --> 52:16.675
Who are you?

52:21.304 --> 52:22.430
Jung-hyun.

52:27.936 --> 52:29.855
It's me. Don't you remember?

52:33.275 --> 52:34.442
Are you…

52:36.736 --> 52:37.696
Kyung-joo?

52:47.622 --> 52:48.957
If Min-jae hadn't told me,

52:49.040 --> 52:51.543
I wouldn't have known
that your mother was staying here.

52:51.626 --> 52:54.462
Oh, so much has been happening lately.

52:55.171 --> 52:56.464
Min-ja is helping a lot.

53:00.051 --> 53:03.513
I heard about what happened
to Jae-young on the news.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.476
I thought about reaching out,
but I didn't want to bother you.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.939
That's okay. Thanks.

53:16.651 --> 53:17.611
Actually,

53:18.820 --> 53:21.573
my husband is assigned to
Jae-young's kidnapping case.

53:23.658 --> 53:25.577
I didn't know that.

53:25.660 --> 53:27.454
That's why I couldn't call you.

53:28.121 --> 53:30.123
I believe in my husband,

53:31.541 --> 53:34.169
but there hasn't been a breakthrough
in the case yet, so…

53:44.971 --> 53:46.348
Jung-hyun.

53:47.557 --> 53:51.311
I don't know if this will
make you feel better,

53:53.188 --> 53:55.106
but a lot of people are worried about her.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.193
So you have …

54:00.862 --> 54:02.322
stay strong, okay?

54:04.741 --> 54:06.076
Stay strong.

54:06.993 --> 54:07.994
Understand?

55:11.641 --> 55:12.726
Thanks.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.823
Thank you for coming.

55:26.906 --> 55:27.907
Don't mention it.

55:27.991 --> 55:31.244
It's been a while
since I've cried like that.

55:33.038 --> 55:36.166
I'll call you if my husband
mentions anything about the case.

55:36.249 --> 55:37.792
Okay. Thanks.

55:37.876 --> 55:39.461
-See you.
-Bye.

55:40.462 --> 55:41.880
Oh, I almost forgot.

55:41.963 --> 55:45.759
Min-jae said you had something to ask.
But you didn't bring it up.

55:46.926 --> 55:48.762
Oh, never mind.

55:48.845 --> 55:50.930
It's not that important.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.475
I just had a hunch about something.

55:54.059 --> 55:54.893
About what?

55:55.977 --> 55:57.937
It's about the videotape
we watched together once.

55:59.105 --> 56:02.400
Remember when someone delivered
a tape to our club room?

56:05.236 --> 56:06.529
I remember that.

56:07.155 --> 56:08.031
Yes.

56:08.114 --> 56:11.242
But nobody remembers
the images they saw in the video.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.411
It's confusing.

56:14.287 --> 56:16.206
I don't think it matters much right now.

56:17.082 --> 56:18.041
No, I do.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.210
What?

56:20.877 --> 56:22.420
I remember the video.

56:26.174 --> 56:27.592
You do?

56:28.134 --> 56:29.094
I remember it.

56:30.595 --> 56:31.805
The bell sound

56:32.472 --> 56:34.307
and strange murmurings.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.312
A girl with her arms covering her face…

56:49.114 --> 56:50.657
The Skull Gang was working with

56:51.449 --> 56:55.453
the Yamayoshi Kai, yakuza syndicate
that is based in Osaka.

56:56.037 --> 56:57.539
Even the anti-narcotics division

56:58.832 --> 57:01.417
was taking a risk
in attacking their hideout.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.671
Could you explain that a bit more?

57:05.588 --> 57:07.465
Since they're connected to the Yakuza,

57:08.299 --> 57:11.469
the Skull Gang is armed
with a lot of firepowers.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.429
I see.

57:13.513 --> 57:17.016
We had two SWAT teams fully armed
including our mobile investigative unit.

57:17.892 --> 57:20.437
It's not easy to pull off
such a large operation.

57:21.604 --> 57:23.690
A lot of preparation went into it.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.276
I heard that the operation was a success.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.654
Is that so?

57:29.737 --> 57:31.322
You don't agree with that assessment?

57:35.160 --> 57:37.454
Our unit had a separate purpose that day.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.457
So it's hard

57:42.375 --> 57:44.919
for me to say it was a success.

57:49.841 --> 57:52.010
<i>So Detective Lee Shi-jung</i>

57:53.761 --> 57:54.888
<i>was there…</i>

58:07.150 --> 58:08.860
On the day we watched that videotape,

58:10.320 --> 58:13.198
I got sick from catching the flu.

58:15.158 --> 58:16.910
You probably don't remember this,

58:16.993 --> 58:19.621
but I missed school
for a week because I was sick.

58:21.748 --> 58:22.957
Oh, really?

58:24.042 --> 58:25.710
I don't remember. Sorry.

58:25.793 --> 58:27.837
And the Chuseok holiday was approaching.

58:28.922 --> 58:30.298
People were busy ahead of it.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.550
And then that happened.

58:34.719 --> 58:35.803
Right.

58:36.679 --> 58:38.431
It happened a few days after

58:39.265 --> 58:40.475
we watched the video.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.021
Jung-hyun…

58:46.689 --> 58:49.400
This might sound crazy,

58:53.238 --> 58:56.908
but ever since I watched the videotape,
I've been having the same recurring dream.

58:58.284 --> 59:00.203
-A dream?
-Yes. A Dream.

59:01.454 --> 59:02.747
The same one.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.126
How is that possible?

59:07.210 --> 59:08.503
I don't know.

59:09.587 --> 59:12.340
The doctor tells me
it's trauma from a terrifying event.

59:14.008 --> 59:15.760
But what I know for certain is that

59:17.512 --> 59:18.513
I'm

59:19.722 --> 59:21.140
suffering from it.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.982
Can I ask you what kind of dream it is?

59:34.362 --> 59:36.906
If you don't want to talk about it,
you don't have to.

59:44.163 --> 59:45.456
It's an upside-down dream.

59:48.501 --> 59:49.544
An upside-down dream?

59:53.423 --> 59:54.882
There is a woman

59:57.635 --> 59:59.137
in the upside-down place.

1:00:00.221 --> 1:00:01.180
A woman?

1:00:01.806 --> 1:00:03.349
The woman in the videotape.

1:00:04.142 --> 1:00:06.269
She's standing across the room.
Upside-down.

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:09.480
And her arms are covering her face.

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:13.234
She's staring at me all night.

1:00:50.772 --> 1:00:53.941
Did you kill Jo Jae-young?

1:00:54.025 --> 1:00:57.236
You're the most important person
in this plan.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.530
<i>But you're removing yourself from it.</i>

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:01.699
What have you done?

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:05.953
Searching for Jo Kyung-ho's daughter
feels like a form of punishment.

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:11.084
<i>You'll find it
in the 1987 school magazine.</i>

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:13.586
<i>It felt like
I was thrashing around in a trap</i>

1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:15.797
that someone had laid out.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.799
Don't you think you came too late?

1:01:20.009 --> 1:01:25.014
