WEBVTT

00:09.272 --> 00:10.855
Is the U.S. government

00:10.856 --> 00:13.609
covering up the truth
about alien contact?

00:15.111 --> 00:17.279
And if so, why?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.698
The government seems to be
completely unaccountable

00:19.699 --> 00:20.991
to the American public.

00:20.992 --> 00:23.076
They rarely release anything

00:23.077 --> 00:25.121
that they know
or their findings.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.500
The fact
that the U.S. government has

00:30.501 --> 00:33.795
investigated thousands
and thousands of reports

00:33.796 --> 00:37.090
leads me to think
they know much more

00:37.091 --> 00:39.467
than they let us believe.

00:39.468 --> 00:42.512
Could the government
have a secret agenda,

00:42.513 --> 00:45.432
one known to only a select few,

00:45.433 --> 00:48.643
and perhaps dating back
hundreds of years?

00:48.644 --> 00:51.062
The government's
program continues

00:51.063 --> 00:54.107
to be deny, deny, deny.

00:54.108 --> 00:56.693
Sometimes,
government finds it helpful

00:56.694 --> 00:59.738
to sow seeds of disinformation
and misinformation

00:59.739 --> 01:03.241
to hide the facts
about these sorts of programs.

01:03.242 --> 01:05.535
Hillary Clinton
was basically saying,

01:05.536 --> 01:07.329
"You are going to give me
the information I need"

01:07.330 --> 01:09.122
to disclose
the extraterrestrial presence,

01:09.123 --> 01:11.041
"or I'm gonna fire
every single one of you."

01:11.042 --> 01:13.251
People want to know
what the government knows,

01:13.252 --> 01:16.172
and they ought to know
what the government knows.

01:46.202 --> 01:51.331
On December 16th, 2017,

01:51.332 --> 01:54.292
<i>The New York Times
ran an explosive story</i>

01:54.293 --> 01:58.088
entitled "Glowing Auras
and 'Black Money':"

01:58.089 --> 02:01.341
The Pentagon's
Mysterious UFO Program."

02:01.342 --> 02:04.969
It was the first time
the American public learned

02:04.970 --> 02:07.889
of a top secret
U.S. government project,

02:07.890 --> 02:11.559
the Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program,

02:11.560 --> 02:14.562
otherwise known as AATIP.

02:14.563 --> 02:16.981
The revelations
concerning the existence

02:16.982 --> 02:20.985
of the Pentagon's AATIP program
are extraordinary.

02:20.986 --> 02:25.240
It is the single
biggest ever news

02:25.241 --> 02:28.159
in the whole history
of the UFO phenomenon.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.914
It's not quite a spaceship
in a hangar smoking gun,

02:32.915 --> 02:35.542
but it's the closest
we've ever been.

02:35.543 --> 02:39.963
I assure you that nothing
like this has ever happened

02:39.964 --> 02:41.714
in the history of this issue.

02:41.715 --> 02:43.926
This is a milestone.
This is a watershed.

02:46.053 --> 02:48.805
The article reported
that the program had been run

02:48.806 --> 02:52.934
by a former Pentagon official
named Luis Elizondo,

02:52.935 --> 02:55.603
a senior career
intelligence officer

02:55.604 --> 03:00.275
with top security clearance and
with experience in everything

03:00.276 --> 03:03.361
from microbiology
and parasitology

03:03.362 --> 03:05.947
to the study
of global terrorism.

03:05.948 --> 03:08.950
It was Elizondo's job
to investigate reports

03:08.951 --> 03:11.536
of unidentified flying objects,

03:11.537 --> 03:15.874
and to measure what threat they
could pose to national security.

03:15.875 --> 03:20.253
AATIP received these cases
from various different channels.

03:20.254 --> 03:22.547
In some cases, reporting would
come up through Navy channels.

03:22.548 --> 03:24.466
In other cases, it would come up
through Air Force channels.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.009
In other cases,
it would come through

03:26.010 --> 03:29.679
the intelligence community,
and all roads led to our office,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.473
regarding the phenomena.

03:31.474 --> 03:35.143
Elizondo played a key role

03:35.144 --> 03:37.812
in the government's
top secret AATIP program

03:37.813 --> 03:42.066
prior to his leaving
the government in 2017.

03:42.067 --> 03:46.488
Among the reasons given for
his departure was the bitterness

03:46.489 --> 03:49.115
he felt that the research
he was conducting,

03:49.116 --> 03:52.702
and the conclusions that he and
his colleagues were reaching,

03:52.703 --> 03:54.746
were not being taken seriously

03:54.747 --> 03:58.041
by other agencies
within the government.

03:58.042 --> 04:02.003
Even Congress, to which
AATIP owed its funding,

04:02.004 --> 04:05.673
was hard-pressed to give
Elizondo so much as a hearing

04:05.674 --> 04:09.427
so that his findings could be
made part of the public record.

04:09.428 --> 04:11.930
Interestingly, just two months

04:11.931 --> 04:15.016
after Elizondo's exit
from the government,

04:15.017 --> 04:17.894
<i>The New York Times
broke the major story,</i>

04:17.894 --> 04:21.314
exposing the AATIP program
and many of the facts

04:21.315 --> 04:23.316
surrounding the government's
secret research

04:23.317 --> 04:25.777
into UFO activity.

04:25.778 --> 04:29.364
<i>When I read in The New York
Times this front page story</i>

04:29.365 --> 04:33.034
that the government was running
this semi-secret program

04:33.035 --> 04:35.745
to investigate, well,
aerial phenomena,

04:35.746 --> 04:38.790
which is kind of
a code word for UFOs,

04:38.791 --> 04:42.126
yeah, you know, I thought,
"My God, all these years,

04:42.127 --> 04:44.295
"you know, people who think
that we're being visited

04:44.296 --> 04:47.549
"were claiming that
the government was, in fact,

04:47.550 --> 04:50.635
"possessing some
secret knowledge about this.

04:50.636 --> 04:53.471
And, sure enough, they did have
this secret investigation."

04:53.472 --> 04:57.183
<i>For Luis Elizondo,
The New York Times article</i>

04:57.184 --> 04:59.143
served as a vindication

04:59.144 --> 05:02.188
for the years that his research
went unrecognized

05:02.189 --> 05:04.566
and his warnings unheeded.

05:04.567 --> 05:08.152
For if the UFO activity
being recorded was real,

05:08.153 --> 05:11.739
so, too, was the possibility
that it was being caused

05:11.740 --> 05:14.659
by technologies
that were not only unknown,

05:14.660 --> 05:17.412
but of extraterrestrial origin.

05:17.413 --> 05:21.124
Elizondo,
he resigned because he felt

05:21.125 --> 05:23.918
the government
considered this a joke.

05:23.919 --> 05:26.421
I think that the fact
that these folks are out there

05:26.422 --> 05:28.923
trying to get the answers
that we're all seeking,

05:28.924 --> 05:31.175
absolutely fantastic.

05:31.176 --> 05:33.595
And they're getting
to top government officials.

05:33.596 --> 05:37.223
And someday,
we're gonna get the answers

05:37.224 --> 05:38.975
from people like that...

05:38.976 --> 05:42.103
Not from government,
but from people like that.

05:42.104 --> 05:45.607
Luckily for Luis Elizondo,

05:45.608 --> 05:48.651
one of the people who took him
and his research seriously

05:48.652 --> 05:52.780
was musician and UFO researcher
Tom DeLonge.

05:52.781 --> 05:55.867
Tom DeLonge, who is most famous

05:55.868 --> 06:00.622
for his being the lead
in Blink-182.

06:00.623 --> 06:04.626
I've known Tom for a while,
and he spearheaded an initiative

06:04.627 --> 06:08.421
that's brought together a number
of scientists and others

06:08.422 --> 06:12.467
to both continue to study
the phenomena on the outside,

06:12.468 --> 06:15.595
in the private sector,
and to raise funds to do that.

06:15.596 --> 06:19.599
His enthusiasm, his passion

06:19.600 --> 06:21.517
has driven things forward.

06:21.518 --> 06:23.269
A lot of people were saying,

06:23.270 --> 06:25.480
"What does a rock star
know about all this?"

06:25.481 --> 06:28.733
Let's not forget that sometimes
even people in government

06:28.734 --> 06:30.485
and military and
the intelligence community

06:30.486 --> 06:35.907
get a little more starstruck
than they should by celebrities.

06:35.908 --> 06:41.621
Tom DeLonge was able to use this
to leverage, I guess, access

06:41.622 --> 06:43.957
where others had
tried and failed.

06:45.918 --> 06:48.336
In October 2017,

06:48.337 --> 06:50.254
Tom DeLonge announced
the creation

06:50.255 --> 06:53.549
of his To The Stars Academy
of Arts & Science,

06:53.550 --> 06:57.679
an organization devoted
to the study of UFOs

06:57.680 --> 07:00.932
and the possible existence
of extraterrestrial activity

07:00.933 --> 07:03.393
here on Earth.

07:03.394 --> 07:07.563
When Elizondo left the Pentagon,
he was determined

07:07.564 --> 07:11.192
to bring AATIP's years of
investigation out of the shadows

07:11.193 --> 07:15.029
by releasing several
of the videos he had collected.

07:15.030 --> 07:18.199
One of them featured
this incredible encounter,

07:18.200 --> 07:22.370
taken by a fighter jet
in Florida in 2015,

07:22.371 --> 07:25.332
now known as the Gimbal video.

07:37.428 --> 07:40.847
On December 18, 2017,

07:40.848 --> 07:44.642
DeLonge and Elizondo revealed
a second shocking video

07:44.643 --> 07:47.770
<i>which was released through
The Washington Post.</i>

07:47.771 --> 07:51.983
<i>This UFO had been tracked
by the USS Princeton</i>

07:51.984 --> 07:54.569
for several days
over the Pacific Ocean,

07:54.570 --> 07:59.949
approximately 100 miles
southwest of San Diego.

07:59.950 --> 08:03.494
On the screen, it also says
the speed of the F-18

08:03.495 --> 08:08.416
is 250 knots, roughly
about 280 miles per hour.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.668
This F-18 can't seem
to get any closer

08:10.669 --> 08:12.545
to this vehicle, whatever it is.

08:12.546 --> 08:15.506
Now, the F-18's one of
the highest technology

08:15.507 --> 08:17.633
fighter crafts on the planet.

08:17.634 --> 08:20.511
And it can't catch this thing?

08:20.512 --> 08:23.765
When it darts offscreen
to the left,

08:23.766 --> 08:26.100
it would be going
extremely fast.

08:26.101 --> 08:28.978
The g-forces would
turn a person inside it

08:28.979 --> 08:30.980
into, like, tapioca pudding.

08:30.981 --> 08:32.941
I mean, it would kill them.

08:35.027 --> 08:37.695
In March 2018,

08:37.696 --> 08:41.240
a third Pentagon video entitled
"Go Fast" was released,

08:41.241 --> 08:45.621
and featured yet another
unexplained aerial encounter.

08:53.212 --> 08:56.464
But perhaps
the most shocking information

08:56.465 --> 09:01.135
to come from Tom DeLonge
and his To The Stars Academy was

09:01.136 --> 09:05.681
Luis Elizondo's claim that
Bigelow Aerospace had modified

09:05.682 --> 09:09.018
its buildings for the storage
of strange metal alloys

09:09.019 --> 09:13.689
of unknown origin,
also known as metamaterials.

09:13.690 --> 09:16.651
Now, hold, stop the presses
right there.

09:16.652 --> 09:18.986
What are these metal alloys?

09:18.987 --> 09:22.073
Luis Elizondo has referred

09:22.074 --> 09:25.493
to these as "meta materials."

09:25.494 --> 09:29.664
The implication is that they're
not special magical elements,

09:29.665 --> 09:31.916
or anything,
but they do seem to be

09:31.917 --> 09:34.669
materials that
have been studied.

09:34.670 --> 09:38.089
According to Elizondo,
tests have been run.

09:38.090 --> 09:39.966
The answer has come back:

09:39.967 --> 09:43.344
whatever these things were,
they came from space.

09:43.345 --> 09:45.388
There was also indications

09:45.389 --> 09:46.806
that there were certain polymers

09:46.807 --> 09:49.892
that were discovered
at crash sites

09:49.893 --> 09:53.855
that were unexplained
and were reviewed.

09:53.856 --> 09:55.982
You know, for years and years,

09:55.983 --> 10:00.027
UFO researchers had talked about
crash retrievals of UFOs,

10:00.028 --> 10:01.654
or that elements
of these objects

10:01.655 --> 10:03.614
had been recovered
and were being studied.

10:03.615 --> 10:06.576
And skeptics would laugh
at these claims.

10:06.577 --> 10:08.619
You know, how ridiculous

10:08.620 --> 10:12.206
such conspiracy
paranoid fantasies were.

10:12.207 --> 10:13.958
Well, guess what.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.544
Now we have it confirmed.

10:16.545 --> 10:19.171
What are these materials?

10:19.172 --> 10:20.756
Are they of this Earth?

10:20.757 --> 10:23.759
Are they from an advanced
alien intelligence?

10:23.760 --> 10:28.264
Were these metals actually taken
from crashed UFOs?

10:28.265 --> 10:32.059
What are the sources
for these kinds of metals?

10:32.060 --> 10:34.770
These are the kind of questions
that we need to learn

10:34.771 --> 10:36.898
the answers to if we're gonna
get to the bottom

10:36.899 --> 10:40.902
of understanding what
the government knows about UFOs.

10:40.903 --> 10:44.864
Is it possible that
the U.S. military has recovered

10:44.865 --> 10:47.825
crashed extraterrestrial
spacecraft,

10:47.826 --> 10:50.453
and that wreckage
from these aircraft

10:50.454 --> 10:53.164
is currently being stored
and studied

10:53.165 --> 10:57.376
by a top-secret team
at Bigelow Aerospace?

10:57.377 --> 11:00.129
One of the really
interesting things about AATIP

11:00.130 --> 11:02.840
is how much information
hasn't been released.

11:02.841 --> 11:04.800
We hear things that are coming.

11:04.801 --> 11:06.677
There's this report
that was written

11:06.678 --> 11:08.596
that we're supposed to get
to see at some point.

11:08.597 --> 11:09.805
Haven't seen it yet.

11:09.806 --> 11:11.849
And then, are there more videos?

11:11.850 --> 11:13.684
We've seen, I think,
three videos come out

11:13.685 --> 11:15.269
that they've released.

11:15.270 --> 11:16.771
There has to be more.

11:16.772 --> 11:18.314
They were doing this for,
like, five years,

11:18.315 --> 11:20.816
or maybe even
a lot longer than that.

11:20.817 --> 11:23.444
I bet you there's a lot more.

11:23.445 --> 11:26.072
Other secret military programs

11:26.073 --> 11:28.658
have been going on
for many, many decades.

11:28.659 --> 11:30.826
And it's really just the tip
of the iceberg.

11:30.827 --> 11:34.872
Was the U.S.
government's AATIP program

11:34.873 --> 11:38.834
the only one to be investigating
extraterrestrial activity?

11:38.835 --> 11:42.588
And, if so, how was
it started, and why?

11:42.589 --> 11:46.133
And was the government
seriously concerned

11:46.134 --> 11:48.135
that such activity
was happening?

11:48.136 --> 11:51.222
Or was the bigger concern
that the public

11:51.223 --> 11:53.809
would find out about it?

11:58.807 --> 12:03.436
Washington, D.C., 2007.

12:03.437 --> 12:06.314
Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid of Nevada

12:06.315 --> 12:09.775
summons Senator Daniel Inouye
from Hawaii

12:09.776 --> 12:13.237
and Alaska Senator Ted Stevens
to a secure room

12:13.238 --> 12:16.407
in the Capitol Building
for a secret meeting.

12:16.408 --> 12:19.160
He convinces them
to lend their support

12:19.161 --> 12:22.371
to fund a project
researching UFO reports

12:22.372 --> 12:24.665
in the interest
of national security...

12:24.666 --> 12:28.628
The Advanced Aviation Threat
Identification Program,

12:28.629 --> 12:30.254
or AATIP.

12:30.255 --> 12:33.132
Senator Reid was successful
in getting money

12:33.133 --> 12:36.302
into the Defense Department
budget

12:36.303 --> 12:40.723
to create a small office
to look at

12:40.724 --> 12:42.600
what the government knew,

12:42.601 --> 12:46.854
and to study some more recent
incidents that had occurred,

12:46.855 --> 12:48.522
and to delve into
the background,

12:48.523 --> 12:51.859
and to try to explain
what pilots who had encountered

12:51.860 --> 12:54.653
strange aerial phenomena
couldn't explain.

12:54.654 --> 12:57.531
Without any public debate,

12:57.532 --> 13:01.160
$22 million is allocated
for AATIP

13:01.161 --> 13:04.372
from a black money budget
that few people know about

13:04.373 --> 13:05.873
or can monitor.

13:05.874 --> 13:07.416
Much of it,
I think, was classified.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.293
Much of it was unclassified,

13:09.294 --> 13:12.213
but I think people didn't know
about the program.

13:12.214 --> 13:16.258
I'm very glad that my friend
Harry Reid decided

13:16.259 --> 13:20.012
that he would pursue this
and sought money for it.

13:20.013 --> 13:23.057
Senator Stevens was genuinely
interested in the topic.

13:23.058 --> 13:25.101
But none of them
went out and discussed it.

13:25.102 --> 13:29.271
When later asked about
his support for the program,

13:29.272 --> 13:32.775
Senator Reid said that he was
inspired by his friend,

13:32.776 --> 13:36.904
retired former senator
and astronaut John Glenn.

13:36.905 --> 13:40.741
Glenn, the first American
astronaut to orbit the Earth,

13:40.742 --> 13:43.786
told Reid that he thought
that the federal government

13:43.787 --> 13:46.831
should be looking seriously
into UFOs.

13:46.832 --> 13:50.126
But there are some who believe
that Reid's support

13:50.127 --> 13:53.254
owes less to John Glenn
than to his friendship

13:53.255 --> 13:56.841
with one of the senator's
largest campaign contributors:

13:56.842 --> 14:02.638
Robert Bigelow, the founder
of Bigelow Aerospace.

14:02.639 --> 14:06.517
Robert Bigelow owned
a series of hotels,

14:06.518 --> 14:09.103
and he sold it
and made a lot of money.

14:09.104 --> 14:13.774
He decided then he wanted
to get into space exploration.

14:13.775 --> 14:17.945
He's fascinated by
extraterrestrials and UFOs.

14:17.946 --> 14:21.949
NASA was providing insight,
as opposed to oversight...

14:21.950 --> 14:25.035
Which is an important
distinction there...

14:25.036 --> 14:27.997
And his dear friend,
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada,

14:27.998 --> 14:31.375
was convinced by Robert Bigelow

14:31.376 --> 14:33.961
to get the government
to spend $22 million

14:33.962 --> 14:36.672
into this program
to investigate UFOs.

14:36.673 --> 14:38.716
It's not
a coincidence, to my mind,

14:38.717 --> 14:40.301
that he was involved in

14:40.302 --> 14:43.888
the Advanced Aerospace Threat
Identification Program.

14:43.889 --> 14:46.265
He builds rockets and planes
and who knows what else,

14:46.266 --> 14:48.350
and he seems like
a perfectly logical person

14:48.351 --> 14:51.979
to have been the point man
in the private sector

14:51.980 --> 14:55.524
for using the information that
was gleaned from that project,

14:55.525 --> 14:58.194
whatever it was, and we don't
know what a lot of it was

14:58.195 --> 14:59.487
because it's classified.

14:59.488 --> 15:01.572
At the time,

15:01.573 --> 15:04.158
the fact that much
of AATIP's research was

15:04.159 --> 15:07.328
outsourced to Bigelow Aerospace
made perfect sense.

15:07.329 --> 15:11.165
First of all, the company
already had a staff

15:11.166 --> 15:14.502
of highly qualified
aerospace engineers.

15:14.503 --> 15:18.339
And, secondly, an outside
company could operate

15:18.340 --> 15:20.382
without the kind
of public scrutiny

15:20.383 --> 15:23.260
imposed on
a government-based agency.

15:23.261 --> 15:27.097
Bigelow could operate
in total secrecy.

15:27.098 --> 15:30.684
Private companies aren't held to
the Freedom of Information Act.

15:30.685 --> 15:32.895
Private companies can do
whatever they want to

15:32.896 --> 15:36.148
with their funding, and
you can't go then and fill out

15:36.149 --> 15:38.234
a Freedom of Information Act
request.

15:38.235 --> 15:41.570
That's a way to keep things
more secretive.

15:41.571 --> 15:45.115
But was the AATIP
program's need for secrecy

15:45.116 --> 15:48.202
merely designed
to keep its UFO findings

15:48.203 --> 15:51.038
independent of public scrutiny?

15:51.039 --> 15:54.083
Or was there
a greater interest in hiding

15:54.084 --> 15:56.293
not only what AATIP was finding,

15:56.294 --> 16:01.049
but also what those in charge
of the program were looking for?

16:03.301 --> 16:06.011
In May 2017,

16:06.012 --> 16:08.389
Robert Bigelow was the subject
of a profile

16:08.390 --> 16:11.058
<i>on CBS's 60 Minutes.</i>

16:11.059 --> 16:13.978
The piece was meant to focus

16:13.979 --> 16:16.063
on Bigelow's relationship
to NASA

16:16.064 --> 16:19.733
and his activities in creating
life-support habitats

16:19.734 --> 16:21.443
for future astronauts.

16:21.444 --> 16:25.906
<i>During his interview,
Bigelow revealed to 60 Minutes</i>

16:25.907 --> 16:29.243
that he was not only
an aerospace enthusiast,

16:29.244 --> 16:33.248
but a full-fledged believer
in extraterrestrials.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.959
Do you believe in aliens?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.795
I'm absolutely convinced.
That's all there is to it.

16:39.796 --> 16:43.090
Do you also believe
that UFOs have come to Earth?

16:43.091 --> 16:45.259
There has been and is
an existing presence...

16:45.260 --> 16:46.677
An E.T. presence.

16:46.678 --> 16:47.928
And I've spent millions
and millions.

16:47.929 --> 16:49.680
I've probably spent more
as an individual

16:49.681 --> 16:51.348
than anybody else
in the United States

16:51.349 --> 16:53.559
has ever spent on this subject.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.603
Is it risky for you to say,

16:55.604 --> 16:57.104
you know, in public
that you believe

16:57.105 --> 16:59.023
- in UFOs and aliens?
- I don't give a damn.

16:59.024 --> 17:00.816
- I don't care.
- You don't worry

17:00.817 --> 17:02.776
that some people will say,
"Did you hear that guy?

17:02.777 --> 17:03.944
He sounds like he's crazy."

17:03.945 --> 17:05.904
- I don't care.
- Why not?

17:05.905 --> 17:07.281
It's not gonna
make a difference.

17:07.281 --> 17:10.576
It's not gonna change reality
of what I know.

17:10.577 --> 17:12.536
Bob Bigelow said,

17:12.537 --> 17:14.829
"E.T.s are here.
They're right under your nose."

17:14.830 --> 17:17.833
And he uses the word "E.T."
He doesn't beat around the bush.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.712
Robert Bigelow became my hero.

17:21.713 --> 17:25.799
That "I don't give a damn"
really was for a lot of people.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.553
It was for every billionaire
space jockey out there,

17:29.554 --> 17:34.600
whether it's Elon Musk
or Branson or Bezos.

17:34.601 --> 17:36.226
But guess what.

17:36.227 --> 17:40.689
None of those people
have ever said to a reporter,

17:40.690 --> 17:43.734
"You know, I'm pretty sure
there's extraterrestrials here."

17:43.735 --> 17:46.278
Bigelow did.

17:46.279 --> 17:49.573
We must now go and ask the head

17:49.574 --> 17:52.826
of Bigelow Aerospace
what does he mean

17:52.827 --> 17:56.288
that aliens are
under everyone's noses.

17:56.289 --> 17:59.833
This story really is begging

17:59.834 --> 18:03.337
for somebody
to go to Robert Bigelow

18:03.338 --> 18:06.675
and say, "Can we now go
and see your warehouse?"

18:09.010 --> 18:13.430
What a fantastic next step
it would be for the world.

18:13.431 --> 18:17.518
Although funding
for the AATIP program

18:17.519 --> 18:20.771
was quietly ended in 2012,

18:20.772 --> 18:24.441
there are those who believe
that its focus on the study

18:24.442 --> 18:25.859
of recent UFO activity

18:25.860 --> 18:28.362
and on the study
of extraterrestrial life

18:28.363 --> 18:31.073
are still alive and well,

18:31.074 --> 18:35.577
although now further hidden
under a different agency name.

18:35.578 --> 18:38.747
When the Pentagon
grudgingly admitted

18:38.748 --> 18:41.125
the existence
of the AATIP program,

18:41.126 --> 18:42.751
they did a clever thing,

18:42.752 --> 18:47.131
and they said that the funding
had run out in 2012.

18:47.132 --> 18:50.759
The implication was
that the program was no more,

18:50.760 --> 18:52.469
but with my knowledge of the way

18:52.470 --> 18:55.639
in which these classified
sensitive programs are run,

18:55.640 --> 18:57.266
pulling the funding part

18:57.267 --> 19:00.686
is not the same
as terminating the project.

19:00.687 --> 19:04.314
But while some version
of the government's

19:04.315 --> 19:08.026
AATIP program may still be
operating in secret,

19:08.027 --> 19:09.778
the same cannot be said

19:09.779 --> 19:12.781
for some of the agency's
former employees.

19:12.782 --> 19:15.409
And there is one in particular

19:15.410 --> 19:19.413
who is not only open to the idea
that aliens do exist,

19:19.414 --> 19:21.373
he has made it his mission

19:21.374 --> 19:25.253
to communicate his findings
throughout the world.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.660
<i>When The New York
Times story broke,</i>

19:29.661 --> 19:32.371
revealing the existence
of the U.S. government's

19:32.372 --> 19:35.040
ultra top secret AATIP program,

19:35.041 --> 19:38.127
UFO experts
and ancient astronaut theorists

19:38.128 --> 19:40.504
had validation
for what they knew

19:40.505 --> 19:43.465
had been happening for decades:

19:43.466 --> 19:47.595
that the government has proof
of extraterrestrial visitation

19:47.596 --> 19:50.890
and that they have been
hiding it from the public.

19:50.891 --> 19:53.392
The investigations were denied

19:53.393 --> 19:55.895
during the time
of their happening.

19:55.896 --> 19:58.898
And it's really curious
that we're always told,

19:58.899 --> 20:01.400
"No, these programs
are not happening."

20:01.401 --> 20:04.904
And then, 20 years later, these
documents are being released

20:04.905 --> 20:09.074
to reveal the fact that
these investigations did happen.

20:09.075 --> 20:12.244
My initial reaction
to the information

20:12.245 --> 20:15.247
that was released
in December of 2017

20:15.248 --> 20:20.085
was that this has really been
going on for over 70 years.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.756
Although
the government's AATIP program

20:23.757 --> 20:26.258
was established in 2007,

20:26.259 --> 20:28.928
it was by no means
the first top secret program

20:28.929 --> 20:31.263
designed to investigate
UFO activity

20:31.264 --> 20:33.098
in the United States.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.810
The first was known simply
as Project Sign,

20:36.811 --> 20:39.939
and it was set up
within the U.S. Air Force

20:39.940 --> 20:43.275
to investigate
unexplained aerial phenomena,

20:43.276 --> 20:48.280
such as the event now known
as the Battle of Los Angeles.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.949
What's called the Battle of I.A.

20:49.950 --> 20:53.744
is actually one of the earliest
unexplained UFO mysteries

20:53.745 --> 20:55.788
in modern... our modern era.

20:55.789 --> 20:58.123
Three months after Pearl Harbor,

20:58.124 --> 21:02.379
it took place on the early
morning of February 25, 1942.

21:04.047 --> 21:07.549
An unknown object appeared
over Los Angeles

21:07.550 --> 21:10.512
and anti-aircraft guns
opened fire on it.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.640
The anti-aircraft guns

21:14.641 --> 21:16.976
began barking during a blackout

21:16.977 --> 21:20.854
ordered by the IV Interceptor
Command at 2:25 a.m.

21:20.855 --> 21:24.108
1,430 artillery shells
were fired

21:24.109 --> 21:28.988
at several unknown objects.

21:28.989 --> 21:33.158
Many eyewitnesses
on the ground saw this.

21:33.159 --> 21:37.663
There was concern that the
Japanese were somehow involved,

21:37.664 --> 21:40.541
but there was no
Japanese aircraft carrier,

21:40.542 --> 21:42.835
no chance
that Japanese airplanes

21:42.836 --> 21:44.670
could have been
responsible for this.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.673
The Secretary of the Navy
said to the public,

21:47.674 --> 21:49.216
"It was just war nerves.

21:49.217 --> 21:51.176
There was nothing out there,
whatsoever."

21:51.177 --> 21:54.179
Although the U.S. Army Air Force

21:54.180 --> 21:56.849
officially dismissed
the objects seen in the sky

21:56.850 --> 21:58.517
as weather balloons,

21:58.518 --> 22:01.311
they failed to explain
why so many weather balloons

22:01.312 --> 22:04.690
would have been floating over
Los Angeles in the first place.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.235
In the years following
the Battle of Los Angeles,

22:08.236 --> 22:11.655
numerous other UFO sightings
were reported,

22:11.656 --> 22:13.824
including the one
widely referred to as

22:13.825 --> 22:18.120
"the Roswell incident,"
in which an unidentified object,

22:18.121 --> 22:21.206
referred to in the press
as a flying saucer,

22:21.207 --> 22:23.876
reportedly crashed on a ranch

22:23.877 --> 22:26.545
just outside the town
of Roswell, New Mexico,

22:26.546 --> 22:30.299
on July 4, 1947.

22:30.300 --> 22:33.844
Within 24 hours,
the story changed.

22:33.845 --> 22:36.388
And they said,
"We made a mistake.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.348
"It's not a flying disc.

22:38.349 --> 22:41.727
It's just debris
from a weather balloon."

22:41.728 --> 22:44.188
The Roswell incident was

22:44.189 --> 22:47.733
probably a major contributor
to the establishment

22:47.734 --> 22:49.401
of what became known
as Project Sign

22:49.402 --> 22:51.404
just a couple of months later.

22:52.739 --> 22:57.242
By the time Project Sign
was established in 1948,

22:57.243 --> 23:00.079
UFO sightings
had become so frequent,

23:00.080 --> 23:03.999
they could no longer
be ignored or dismissed.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.419
Given the fact that there was
a Cold War escalating

23:07.420 --> 23:10.297
between the United States
and the Soviet Union,

23:10.298 --> 23:13.759
concerns that UFOs
might be spy satellites

23:13.760 --> 23:15.969
or foreign-made weapons
gave some justification

23:15.970 --> 23:19.056
to the increasing paranoia.

23:19.057 --> 23:21.266
Answers needed to be found.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.227
But just as the government's

23:23.228 --> 23:26.396
first official UFO program
was getting started,

23:26.397 --> 23:31.401
it was suddenly
and mysteriously shut down.

23:31.402 --> 23:34.488
There was a very big incident
during the summer of 1948,

23:34.489 --> 23:37.407
when a report went to
the Air Force Chief of Staff,

23:37.408 --> 23:38.992
General Hoyt Vandenberg,

23:38.993 --> 23:43.497
and it stated,
"This is real. They're here."

23:43.498 --> 23:47.459
And Vandenberg closed down
Project Sign.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.212
But why would
the Air Force Chief of Staff

23:50.213 --> 23:54.216
shut down a program
designed to study UFOs

23:54.217 --> 23:55.884
just after being informed

23:55.885 --> 24:00.639
that UFOs were not only real
but of genuine concern?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.100
There seems to be
a pattern of suppression

24:03.101 --> 24:05.936
over the last 70 years when
it comes to the UFO subject.

24:05.937 --> 24:08.981
And all of these government
investigations into UFOs,

24:08.982 --> 24:11.942
where they look into it,

24:11.943 --> 24:13.777
then they say
there's nothing to it.

24:13.778 --> 24:15.487
Then they look into it again,

24:15.488 --> 24:17.489
then they're finding
that there is something to it.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.409
But they don't want
to say what it is.

24:23.997 --> 24:25.831
For the next four years,

24:25.832 --> 24:28.208
UFO sightings continued
to be reported,

24:28.209 --> 24:30.002
so many, in fact,

24:30.003 --> 24:33.297
that the government could no
longer dismiss them as hoaxes,

24:33.298 --> 24:34.840
weather anomalies,

24:34.841 --> 24:38.343
or simply the product
of mass hysteria.

24:38.344 --> 24:41.096
By March 1952,

24:41.097 --> 24:43.432
a number of high-ranking
Air Force generals

24:43.433 --> 24:45.767
became so frustrated
with the military's

24:45.768 --> 24:48.270
previous attempts
to properly investigate

24:48.271 --> 24:52.232
so-called flying saucers
that they launched a program

24:52.233 --> 24:55.736
that would be the most serious
and best-funded to date:

24:55.737 --> 24:58.322
Project Blue Book.

24:58.323 --> 25:01.658
Under the command of Air Force
Captain Edward Ruppelt,

25:01.659 --> 25:05.370
this new top secret agency
would take UFOs

25:05.371 --> 25:08.332
and their potential threat
to national security

25:08.333 --> 25:10.000
very seriously.

25:10.001 --> 25:14.504
Project Blue Book
produced a standard form

25:14.505 --> 25:17.257
for people who wanted
to report a UFO.

25:17.258 --> 25:20.219
What did it look like?
Was there a sound?

25:20.220 --> 25:24.306
They even had a chart
for people to calculate

25:24.307 --> 25:27.559
the angle of elevation.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.437
If UFOs are nothing
to worry about,

25:30.438 --> 25:34.858
why is the Air Force
requesting so much information

25:34.859 --> 25:37.653
about the true nature
of what the witnesses saw?

25:37.654 --> 25:41.615
In January 1953,

25:41.616 --> 25:44.576
after gathering hundreds
of reported sightings,

25:44.577 --> 25:46.912
photographs and interviews,

25:46.913 --> 25:50.707
Captain Ruppelt and astronomer
Dr. J. Allen Hynek

25:50.708 --> 25:53.752
prepared and presented
their best 23 cases

25:53.753 --> 25:57.047
to a CIA-formed panel
of scientists

25:57.048 --> 26:00.717
led by Dr. H.P. Robertson.

26:00.718 --> 26:02.761
The Robertson Panel concluded

26:02.762 --> 26:05.264
that the evidence
could all be dismissed

26:05.265 --> 26:07.099
as natural occurrences

26:07.100 --> 26:10.644
and was not worth the effort
of the government.

26:10.645 --> 26:13.438
And it was the Robertson Panel
which was the origin

26:13.439 --> 26:16.108
for a lot of the propaganda
that was put out in the media

26:16.109 --> 26:19.278
when it came to UFOs.

26:19.279 --> 26:21.196
They wanted to publicly
ridicule the subject,

26:21.197 --> 26:24.116
so that people wouldn't want
to be associated with it,

26:24.117 --> 26:26.410
basically killing
all the public interest

26:26.411 --> 26:29.037
in this field so they could
continue to research

26:29.038 --> 26:31.040
these exotic technologies
behind the scenes.

26:34.669 --> 26:40.632
In 1969, Project Blue Book
was finally shut down

26:40.633 --> 26:42.634
on the grounds
that there was no proof

26:42.635 --> 26:46.346
the unidentified objects posed
a national security threat

26:46.347 --> 26:49.641
or were of
extraterrestrial origin.

26:49.642 --> 26:52.644
But was that really
the end of the story

26:52.645 --> 26:55.398
or only the beginning?

26:57.057 --> 26:58.808
In February 2018,

26:58.809 --> 27:02.896
Nick Pope, the former
Director of Defence Security

27:02.897 --> 27:05.064
at the British
Ministry of Defence,

27:05.065 --> 27:09.485
traveled to Washington, D.C.,
to meet with Chase Kloetzke,

27:09.486 --> 27:12.405
a registered lobbyist
for UFO disclosure

27:12.406 --> 27:13.740
and a former program developer

27:13.741 --> 27:17.243
for the U.S.
Department of Defense.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.704
Chase Kloetzke has investigated

27:19.705 --> 27:23.124
numerous U.S. government
secret studies into UFOs

27:23.125 --> 27:26.544
and has examined many
of the once-classified files

27:26.545 --> 27:28.922
pertaining to Project Blue Book.

27:28.923 --> 27:33.468
I've got this Project Blue Book
file from the FBI archives.

27:33.469 --> 27:37.055
And the first page I want
to really go over with you

27:37.056 --> 27:41.851
is this one that indeed reads
"UFO fact sheet."

27:41.852 --> 27:45.229
Okay, so this is basically
a summary of the position

27:45.230 --> 27:46.773
with regard
to Project Blue Book.

27:46.774 --> 27:49.400
- Right, the official statement.
- Okay.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.069
And so, this says,

27:51.070 --> 27:53.780
"Since the termination
of Project Blue Book,

27:53.781 --> 27:56.449
"no evidence has been
presented to indicate

27:56.450 --> 27:58.743
"that further
investigation of UFOs

27:58.744 --> 28:00.328
by the Air Force is warranted."

28:00.329 --> 28:02.205
"Terminated."

28:02.206 --> 28:06.459
Well, was the program really
terminated? That's my question.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.921
Absolutely. And if it was,
what took its place?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.297
Well, yes, the Air Force

28:11.298 --> 28:13.967
isn't suddenly going to stop
being interested

28:13.968 --> 28:17.178
in uncorrelated targets
in its airspace.

28:17.179 --> 28:19.180
Right, absolutely.
And the second document,

28:19.181 --> 28:21.140
I really want you
to weigh in on.

28:21.141 --> 28:22.433
It doesn't make sense.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.728
Wow. 12,618 sightings.

28:25.729 --> 28:27.146
That's a lot.

28:27.147 --> 28:31.985
And 701 of them remained
completely unidentified.

28:31.986 --> 28:33.319
That's a staggering amount.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.240
These are the cases
that were properly investigated,

28:37.241 --> 28:41.661
interviewed witnesses,
radar tapes were looked at,

28:41.662 --> 28:44.163
and still no answers found.

28:44.164 --> 28:47.667
Wait a minute.
Here, look. Here it is.

28:47.668 --> 28:51.170
At the end of the program,
the unknowns drop.

28:51.171 --> 28:56.509
They go from 32 to 19
to three and one.

28:56.510 --> 28:59.804
I smell a rat.
They've cooked the books.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.974
- They can't pull the plug on the program...
- Right.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.143
...if you've still got
a high number of unknowns.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.854
So they clearly
pushed those cases

29:07.855 --> 29:10.314
out of the unidentified column

29:10.315 --> 29:13.818
and into the cases that are
explained, at least publicly.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.904
This is their way out.

29:18.699 --> 29:21.701
Was Project Blue Book
officially shut down

29:21.702 --> 29:24.328
because it had simply found
no convincing evidence

29:24.329 --> 29:26.372
that UFOs were real?

29:26.373 --> 29:28.833
Or was it because the government

29:28.834 --> 29:31.044
had come to
the opposite conclusion,

29:31.045 --> 29:36.507
that not only were they real
but of extraterrestrial origin,

29:36.508 --> 29:40.553
a truth that could be
so potentially disturbing,

29:40.554 --> 29:44.516
it needed to be covered up
even deeper than before?

29:48.477 --> 29:50.561
As far as UFO researchers

29:50.562 --> 29:53.272
and ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

29:53.273 --> 29:56.567
proof that the U.S. government
has not only known

29:56.568 --> 29:59.403
about extraterrestrial activity
on our planet,

29:59.404 --> 30:02.573
but has been systematically
covering it up for decades,

30:02.574 --> 30:04.408
first came in the form

30:04.409 --> 30:07.620
of a single roll
of 35-millimeter film,

30:07.621 --> 30:10.456
anonymously sent
to a documentary filmmaker

30:10.457 --> 30:15.128
by the name of
Jaime Shandera in 1984.

30:16.338 --> 30:18.297
The film, when developed,

30:18.298 --> 30:20.633
showed images
of an eight-page memo

30:20.634 --> 30:23.344
allegedly written in 1952

30:23.345 --> 30:27.598
by the first director of
the CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter,

30:27.599 --> 30:30.810
to President-elect
Dwight Eisenhower.

30:30.811 --> 30:34.563
In it, Hillenkoetter
informs Eisenhower

30:34.564 --> 30:37.942
of the existence of a top secret
government think tank

30:37.943 --> 30:39.777
that was originally set up

30:39.778 --> 30:43.364
by President Harry S. Truman
in 1947.

30:43.365 --> 30:47.618
It was referred to
in the memo as MJ-12,

30:47.619 --> 30:51.664
initials which stood for a far
more mysterious group of men

30:51.665 --> 30:54.458
known as the Majestic 12.

30:54.459 --> 30:57.253
The authorization
to establish MJ-12

30:57.254 --> 30:59.797
allegedly came from
President Harry Truman

30:59.798 --> 31:02.508
on September 24, 1947.

31:02.509 --> 31:07.638
This was actually one day
after the famous memo

31:07.639 --> 31:09.974
in which
General Nathan Twining wrote

31:09.975 --> 31:11.809
a three-page letter
about these flying saucers

31:11.810 --> 31:13.436
to another general,

31:13.437 --> 31:16.480
talking quite explicitly
about their characteristics,

31:16.481 --> 31:19.650
the fact that this was real,
not visionary or fictitious.

31:19.651 --> 31:23.988
No one anywhere,
outside of this group,

31:23.989 --> 31:27.366
is to know anything about UFOs,

31:27.367 --> 31:32.247
E.T.s, crash retrievals,
bodies, any of it.

31:34.833 --> 31:37.001
That document identified
the 12 people

31:37.002 --> 31:39.503
who were MJ-1 through MJ-12.

31:39.504 --> 31:41.505
The first one, MJ-1,

31:41.506 --> 31:44.342
was Admiral Hillenkoetter
of the Navy.

31:44.343 --> 31:46.594
There were four military people,

31:46.595 --> 31:48.429
there were
four technical people,

31:48.430 --> 31:51.974
and then there were
just general government people.

31:51.975 --> 31:53.851
They were the kind of people
you'd expect

31:53.852 --> 31:56.896
to have been involved in
an important top secret program.

31:56.897 --> 31:59.357
While the authenticity

31:59.358 --> 32:02.568
of the MJ-12 documents
is still being debated,

32:02.569 --> 32:04.528
what is known is that,

32:04.529 --> 32:09.033
in 1954, Eisenhower thought
enough of the UFO phenomenon

32:09.034 --> 32:13.704
to order that a new
secret military base be set up.

32:13.705 --> 32:18.709
Located 83 miles northwest
of Las Vegas, Nevada,

32:18.710 --> 32:21.379
Area 51 would later
become infamous

32:21.380 --> 32:25.633
as the most top secret
military base in the world.

32:25.634 --> 32:30.554
Area 51 is the secret base
of all secret bases.

32:30.555 --> 32:33.224
<i>For a long time,
it was the place</i>

32:33.225 --> 32:37.561
that we went to
to study foreign technology.

32:37.562 --> 32:40.439
During the 1970s and '80s,

32:40.440 --> 32:43.234
T.D. Barnes worked
at the secret base,

32:43.235 --> 32:46.237
reverse-engineering
captured enemy aircraft,

32:46.238 --> 32:48.572
like Russian MiG jets.

32:48.573 --> 32:51.075
What we considered
reverse-engineering was...

32:51.076 --> 32:54.328
was taking a plane or a radar,

32:54.329 --> 32:56.330
taking it apart,
looking at the electronics,

32:56.331 --> 32:57.915
how they built it.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.251
We were all bound
by security oaths.

33:00.252 --> 33:01.669
We could not talk.

33:01.670 --> 33:03.671
But is it possible that,

33:03.672 --> 33:05.464
in addition
to reverse-engineering

33:05.465 --> 33:07.258
foreign fighter jets,

33:07.259 --> 33:10.636
Area 51 employees
were also working on other,

33:10.637 --> 33:13.764
out-of-this-world technologies?

33:13.765 --> 33:16.851
To my mind, it's also
clear that the U.S. government

33:16.852 --> 33:20.604
has had crashed
extraterrestrial technology,

33:20.605 --> 33:23.607
and Area 51 would have been
the perfect place

33:23.608 --> 33:27.445
to reverse-engineer and test
that particular information.

33:27.446 --> 33:29.822
In order
to insure that the activities

33:29.823 --> 33:33.742
at Area 51 and elsewhere were
kept hidden from the public,

33:33.743 --> 33:36.162
members of the military,
and even officers,

33:36.163 --> 33:38.664
were sworn to secrecy.

33:38.665 --> 33:42.501
But luckily for UFO researchers
and ancient astronaut theorists,

33:42.502 --> 33:46.297
not everyone involved
was willing to keep quiet.

33:46.298 --> 33:48.632
Some became whistleblowers,

33:48.633 --> 33:51.677
who risked everything from
public scorn to imprisonment,

33:51.678 --> 33:55.474
in order to let the public
learn the truth.

33:57.726 --> 33:59.727
Washington state.

33:59.728 --> 34:02.522
June 24, 1947.

34:03.815 --> 34:06.525
Aviator and businessman
Kenneth Arnold

34:06.526 --> 34:08.985
witnesses
nine fast-moving objects

34:08.987 --> 34:12.031
flying in tandem
near Mount Rainier.

34:12.032 --> 34:15.826
He times them as they fly
between two mountain peaks,

34:15.827 --> 34:17.328
and calculates their speed

34:17.329 --> 34:21.706
to be between
1,200 and 1,700 miles per hour,

34:21.708 --> 34:24.710
at least
600 miles per hour faster

34:24.710 --> 34:28.839
than the fastest aircraft
in existence at the time.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.884
Kenneth Arnold is the guy
who actually is credited

34:31.885 --> 34:34.136
with coining the term
"flying saucer,"

34:34.137 --> 34:37.306
because what he saw
were objects that were flying

34:37.306 --> 34:39.516
at some distance
from his airplane

34:39.518 --> 34:42.603
that were sort of skipping
and jumping and wobbling

34:42.603 --> 34:45.188
and doing very, very unusual
high-speed maneuvers.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.900
So that's where the term
"flying saucer" came from.

34:47.900 --> 34:51.195
Although the U.S.
Air Force formally categorized

34:51.196 --> 34:54.239
Kenneth Arnold's experience
as a mirage,

34:54.241 --> 34:58.369
other reported sightings
were not so easily dismissed.

34:58.370 --> 35:01.914
The public was starting
to demand answers.

35:01.915 --> 35:04.208
Once the initial sighting
happened by Kenneth Arnold,

35:04.209 --> 35:07.378
and the Roswell incident
took place,

35:07.379 --> 35:11.090
there were sightings everywhere
around the United States.

35:11.091 --> 35:13.635
They were happening
all over the world.

35:15.887 --> 35:20.766
In 1949, retired Marine
Corps pilot-turned-writer

35:20.767 --> 35:24.728
<i>Major Donald Keyhoe
was asked by True magazine</i>

35:24.729 --> 35:28.232
to write an article
on these numerous sightings.

35:28.233 --> 35:30.734
Although Keyhoe was a skeptic,

35:30.735 --> 35:33.571
he spent the next eight months
conducting his own research

35:33.572 --> 35:35.990
by tapping into his contacts
in the Pentagon

35:35.991 --> 35:38.242
and the military.

35:38.243 --> 35:40.744
Eventually,
he came to a conclusion

35:40.745 --> 35:43.414
he would have considered
unthinkable:

35:43.415 --> 35:46.584
flying saucers
were not only real,

35:46.585 --> 35:50.796
they were of
extraterrestrial origin.

35:50.797 --> 35:52.756
Major Keyhoe

35:52.757 --> 35:56.427
was one of the last real
military voices,

35:56.428 --> 35:58.929
from the time of
the Truman administration

35:58.930 --> 36:01.140
going into
the Eisenhower administration,

36:01.141 --> 36:06.562
who was honestly trying
to tell the truth.

36:06.563 --> 36:10.441
<i>Keyhoe's article in
True magazine shook the nation.</i>

36:10.442 --> 36:13.277
It was not only
a solid piece of journalism

36:13.278 --> 36:16.447
on the topic of UFOs,

36:16.448 --> 36:18.365
but served as
a stinging indictment

36:18.366 --> 36:21.285
of the U.S. military and
the government's determination

36:21.286 --> 36:24.246
to keep the public in the dark.

36:24.247 --> 36:28.292
<i>That True magazine,
it was historic because</i>

36:28.293 --> 36:30.669
it went to a heck
of a lot of people.

36:30.670 --> 36:33.130
Then, in 1958,
Keyhoe went on a program

36:33.131 --> 36:34.965
<i>called the
Armstrong Circle Theatre,</i>

36:34.966 --> 36:36.634
which was
a live television program.

36:36.635 --> 36:39.970
"The Enigma of the Skies"

36:39.971 --> 36:43.307
<i>on the Armstrong Circle Theatre.</i>

36:43.308 --> 36:46.810
Major, you've seen our report
on the Air Force conclusions

36:46.811 --> 36:49.105
dealing with the current
UFO sightings.

36:50.649 --> 36:52.399
Well, I was excited to hear that

36:52.400 --> 36:55.152
Keyhoe was going to
debate the Air Force.

36:55.153 --> 36:58.280
And now, Mr. Edwards, I would
like to make a disclosure,

36:58.281 --> 37:01.075
something which has never
been revealed to the public.

37:01.076 --> 37:04.328
Toward the end of the program,
he broke in and said,

37:04.329 --> 37:07.331
to the effect,
"I'm going to say something

37:07.332 --> 37:09.333
that the public
has never heard before."

37:09.334 --> 37:11.710
If the hearings are held,
open hearings,

37:11.711 --> 37:14.798
I feel it will prove beyond
doubt that flying saucers...

37:17.384 --> 37:21.011
At that point,
his sound was lost.

37:21.012 --> 37:26.184
What was Major Keyhoe saying,
and who cut him off?

37:28.228 --> 37:29.269
Thank you, Major Keyhoe.

37:29.270 --> 37:31.772
It was later discovered

37:31.773 --> 37:33.899
that Air Force officials
had been stationed

37:33.900 --> 37:36.568
in the control booth
during the broadcast.

37:36.569 --> 37:39.196
And there are many who still
believe that Keyhoe's audio

37:39.197 --> 37:42.991
was deliberately cut in order
to keep him from revealing

37:42.992 --> 37:46.704
top secret information
concerning the government's

37:46.705 --> 37:48.206
ongoing UFO investigations.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.918
<i>The Air Force was lying.</i>

37:53.837 --> 37:57.005
But why was the
Air Force so concerned about

37:57.006 --> 38:00.050
the American public hearing
Major Keyhoe's statement?

38:00.051 --> 38:03.762
What did they have to lose
if they were forced to admit

38:03.763 --> 38:07.641
their ongoing investigations
into UFOs?

38:07.642 --> 38:09.560
I wrote this down
because I think

38:09.561 --> 38:12.604
it's one of the most important
historic sentences,

38:12.605 --> 38:15.149
and it comes from Major Keyhoe.

38:15.150 --> 38:19.778
"For the past 175 years..."

38:19.779 --> 38:22.489
That would be 1772.

38:22.490 --> 38:26.076
That would be before the
founding of the United States.

38:26.077 --> 38:30.748
"...the planet Earth
has been under systematic,

38:30.749 --> 38:34.585
"close-range examination by

38:34.586 --> 38:39.507
living observers
from another planet."

38:40.800 --> 38:43.427
This is nothing new.

38:43.428 --> 38:44.970
These cover-ups have happened

38:44.971 --> 38:47.264
for thousands and thousands
of years.

38:47.265 --> 38:50.476
Throughout ancient texts,
there are references

38:50.477 --> 38:54.104
to what I call
"misunderstood technology."

38:54.105 --> 38:56.607
In modern times,

38:56.608 --> 38:59.777
you'll hear stories
of UFOs and spacecraft,

38:59.778 --> 39:02.446
because now we have the language
to talk about technology.

39:02.447 --> 39:05.365
Whereas in ancient times,
they didn't have any reference

39:05.366 --> 39:07.576
to that kind of technology.

39:07.577 --> 39:09.495
So they would have thought
this is something

39:09.496 --> 39:12.832
that's angelic or from
another dimension or god-like.

39:14.584 --> 39:18.295
The fact that the U.S.
government has investigated

39:18.296 --> 39:21.131
thousands and thousands
of reports

39:21.132 --> 39:24.051
leads me to think that

39:24.052 --> 39:29.099
they may know much more
than what they let us believe.

39:36.397 --> 39:39.066
Proof of
the U.S. government's complicity

39:39.067 --> 39:41.652
in covering up
extraterrestrial activity

39:41.653 --> 39:44.696
does not only come
in the form of leaked documents

39:44.697 --> 39:47.491
and the contents
of secret files.

39:47.492 --> 39:50.702
Sometimes the evidence comes

39:50.703 --> 39:53.622
from credible
firsthand accounts,

39:53.623 --> 39:58.877
not from whistleblowers,
but from American astronauts.

39:58.878 --> 40:02.381
Everything that NASA does
is supposedly aboveboard.

40:02.382 --> 40:05.676
Everything they do,
they should tell us about.

40:05.677 --> 40:08.011
We should know about
all of their launches

40:08.012 --> 40:11.598
and missions and who
all the astronauts are.

40:11.599 --> 40:14.935
They themselves are not sharing
all of the information.

40:14.936 --> 40:17.647
Most of it is being kept secret.

40:24.270 --> 40:27.147
The Baikonur Cosmodrome.

40:27.148 --> 40:30.900
April 12, 1961.

40:30.901 --> 40:34.988
The Vostok-1 rocket
achieves liftoff,

40:34.989 --> 40:38.158
and Soviet cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin

40:38.159 --> 40:40.953
is heralded
as the first human in space.

40:42.246 --> 40:44.247
The event serves
as a wake-up call

40:44.248 --> 40:46.833
to the United States and NASA,

40:46.834 --> 40:51.004
whose Project Mercury program
would, over the next two years,

40:51.005 --> 40:54.007
launch six of its own astronauts
into space.

40:54.008 --> 40:56.009
The Space Race...

40:56.010 --> 40:58.887
To land a human being
on the Moon... was on,

40:58.888 --> 41:02.724
and mankind was now
a space-faring species.

41:02.725 --> 41:05.644
The achievement
of putting a man in space

41:05.645 --> 41:07.520
was almost a miracle.

41:07.521 --> 41:11.858
Nobody knows what they might see
or encounter out there,

41:11.859 --> 41:15.362
extraterrestrial spacecraft
or even E.T.s themselves.

41:15.363 --> 41:16.571
Liftoff.

41:16.572 --> 41:17.989
Although the first five

41:17.990 --> 41:19.574
Mercury missions
go off without incident...

41:19.575 --> 41:22.118
Liftoff
30 minutes after the hour.

41:22.119 --> 41:24.579
...during
the sixth and final mission,

41:24.580 --> 41:28.750
astronaut Gordon Cooper reports
an unusual encounter.

41:28.751 --> 41:32.379
While aboard his spacecraft,
he reports

41:32.380 --> 41:36.049
a green glowing object
quickly approaching his capsule.

41:36.050 --> 41:39.761
The UFO is also picked up
by NASA's tracking station.

41:39.762 --> 41:43.390
But by the time
Cooper splashes down

41:43.391 --> 41:47.185
in the Pacific Ocean,
reporters are told

41:47.186 --> 41:51.064
that any questions about the
incident are strictly forbidden.

41:51.065 --> 41:55.402
There's no question that NASA
actually has protocols in place

41:55.403 --> 41:58.571
for how astronauts
should deal with

41:58.572 --> 42:01.491
and report or not report
anomalies.

42:01.492 --> 42:04.577
Now, over the years,
there have been astronauts

42:04.578 --> 42:06.454
that have kind of
broken those protocols.

42:06.455 --> 42:09.833
Gordon Cooper is one who talked
a lot about a UFO sighting

42:09.834 --> 42:12.252
he had on a Mercury spacecraft.

42:12.253 --> 42:15.131
And that upset
quite a few people at NASA.

42:16.590 --> 42:19.759
In June 1965,

42:19.760 --> 42:22.595
two years after
Gordon Cooper's flight,

42:22.596 --> 42:26.307
Gemini 4 astronaut
James McDivitt

42:26.308 --> 42:28.685
reports seeing a metallic object

42:28.686 --> 42:32.147
flying in orbit
alongside his spacecraft.

42:32.148 --> 42:36.901
And, once again,
the event is quickly covered up.

42:36.902 --> 42:39.112
There have been many stories
over the years

42:39.113 --> 42:41.072
coming from astronauts
of various missions,

42:41.073 --> 42:43.158
from Mercury missions,
from the Apollo missions,

42:43.159 --> 42:46.161
and even from
the Soviet missions to space,

42:46.162 --> 42:47.787
where astronauts
have come out and said

42:47.788 --> 42:49.873
that they have seen
these UFOs flying around,

42:49.874 --> 42:51.458
that they've been followed,

42:51.459 --> 42:53.126
that they've seen
unconventional aircraft

42:53.127 --> 42:54.711
on some of their missions.

42:54.712 --> 42:57.338
There's a story
that Buzz Aldrin tells

42:57.339 --> 43:00.049
about Apollo 11, where
the Apollo 11 spacecraft

43:00.050 --> 43:03.386
was followed for many,
many hours by an object

43:03.387 --> 43:05.722
that was so strange that
they actually reported on it

43:05.723 --> 43:07.474
through their private channels.

43:07.475 --> 43:10.852
I'm looking
out the window, and I see...

43:10.853 --> 43:12.937
What's that?

43:12.938 --> 43:17.317
There's an object that's moving
with respect to everything else.

43:17.318 --> 43:19.652
Geez. It's not supposed
to be doing that.

43:19.653 --> 43:21.322
Wonder how far away it is.

43:23.282 --> 43:26.743
If it's a long ways away,
it's going mighty fast.

43:26.744 --> 43:31.206
If it's not too far away, it,
uh, maybe isn't going very fast.

43:31.207 --> 43:34.125
Wonder what it is.

43:34.126 --> 43:36.085
"Hey, Neil. Look at this."

43:36.086 --> 43:37.378
We look at it.

43:37.379 --> 43:39.422
God, what is that?

43:39.423 --> 43:43.968
Probably the, uh,
upper stage rocket.

43:43.969 --> 43:47.472
Yeah, but didn't we just watch
that thing carefully

43:47.473 --> 43:50.308
out in front of us,
out the window,

43:50.309 --> 43:53.811
light its engine and go...

43:53.812 --> 43:56.981
Well, I guess that's not what
we're looking at,

43:56.982 --> 43:58.650
'cause that's a long ways away.

43:58.651 --> 44:02.820
What's the odds
that it's some alien

44:02.821 --> 44:05.073
or Russian or something else?

44:05.074 --> 44:09.327
But we were not about
to cancel the Moon mission

44:09.328 --> 44:12.456
and putt-putt over there
to find out which one it was.

44:13.958 --> 44:15.875
There's been many astronauts

44:15.876 --> 44:18.545
that have come forward
that have talked about this,

44:18.546 --> 44:21.589
so it seems like some of them
want to talk about it,

44:21.590 --> 44:24.425
and others are either afraid
to talk about it,

44:24.426 --> 44:26.594
or they've been silenced
for some reason.

44:26.595 --> 44:31.140
One person involved
with the early space program

44:31.141 --> 44:34.811
who did not remain silent
was JoAnn Donaldson,

44:34.812 --> 44:37.730
a young biomedical engineer
at NASA.

44:37.731 --> 44:43.653
In 1972, during the
Apollo 17 Moon mission,

44:43.654 --> 44:47.323
Donaldson's job was to monitor
the astronauts' vital signs

44:47.324 --> 44:51.369
and to observe their pre-flight
and post-flight recovery.

44:51.370 --> 44:54.789
Ron Evans was
in charge of the command module

44:54.790 --> 44:56.958
while Gene Cernan
and Harrison Schmitt

44:56.959 --> 44:58.960
were on the surface of the Moon.

44:58.961 --> 45:02.171
When the command module
would orbit the Moon,

45:02.172 --> 45:05.091
part of the orbit would take it
behind the Moon,

45:05.092 --> 45:09.137
what we call "loss of signal"
to Mission Control.

45:09.138 --> 45:13.182
Day two, Ron came out
from behind the Moon,

45:13.183 --> 45:16.269
reported in to Mission Control.

45:16.270 --> 45:18.896
And Gene comes up
on the comm link and says,

45:18.897 --> 45:22.609
"Hey, Ron, you're not lonely
up there without us are you?"

45:22.610 --> 45:26.571
And Ron reported back, says,
"Nope, I got company."

45:26.572 --> 45:29.073
Everybody was just
kind of taken aback.

45:29.074 --> 45:32.118
It was like, you know,
"company"?

45:32.119 --> 45:35.538
That itself implies
that there was something else

45:35.539 --> 45:37.540
up there with him.

45:37.541 --> 45:40.918
Well, Mission Control's
first reaction was,

45:40.919 --> 45:42.545
"Guys, are you joking?"

45:42.546 --> 45:45.423
And Ron says,
"No, this is not a joke.

45:45.424 --> 45:50.011
"There is an object flying
in formation with me,

45:50.012 --> 45:52.180
up here, circling the Moon."

45:52.181 --> 45:56.643
When Ron reported that the
object was leaving his orbit,

45:56.644 --> 45:59.729
he calculated that they had been
in formation with him

45:59.730 --> 46:01.606
for approximately five

46:01.607 --> 46:04.525
to five-and-a-half orbits
of the Moon.

46:04.526 --> 46:07.612
As far as
the public was concerned,

46:07.613 --> 46:10.448
nothing out of
the ordinary happened.

46:10.449 --> 46:13.451
At the exact moment
that astronaut Ron Evans

46:13.452 --> 46:15.662
reported he was not alone,

46:15.663 --> 46:20.501
NASA officials disconnected the
public feed for media outlets.

46:22.628 --> 46:24.671
The following day, NASA ordered

46:24.672 --> 46:28.299
a conference call for everyone
involved in the incident.

46:28.300 --> 46:31.010
We were all told
we're gonna continue on

46:31.011 --> 46:34.806
with the mission
as if nothing has happened,

46:34.807 --> 46:37.684
and do not discuss this anomaly

46:37.685 --> 46:42.313
with anyone outside
of your command.

46:42.314 --> 46:46.734
After the Apollo 17
crew splashed down

46:46.735 --> 46:51.072
in the Pacific Ocean,
JoAnn Donaldson examined Evans

46:51.073 --> 46:53.866
as part of the post-mission
recovery procedure.

46:53.867 --> 46:57.870
Ron was sitting up
on the side of his bunk.

46:57.871 --> 47:01.457
And he goes, "Well, I'm reliving"

47:01.458 --> 47:04.335
"what I saw while I was
in orbit around the Moon.

47:04.336 --> 47:06.462
"I don't think
the Russians had launched

47:06.463 --> 47:08.715
"something this big in orbit.

47:08.716 --> 47:11.509
"I estimate this thing
was 40, 45 feet long.

47:11.510 --> 47:13.386
It was cigar shaped."

47:13.387 --> 47:15.722
Now, any cylindrical
object like that

47:15.723 --> 47:18.641
is not gonna be something
that we made. So what was it?

47:18.642 --> 47:21.769
Clearly it was not one of ours.

47:21.770 --> 47:23.438
We trust these astronauts

47:23.439 --> 47:25.606
to report back on what they see.

47:25.607 --> 47:26.858
They're essentially scientists

47:26.859 --> 47:28.276
that are exploring space
on our behalf.

47:28.277 --> 47:30.862
But a lot of people
are unaware of the fact

47:30.863 --> 47:33.573
that many of our astronauts
have spoken openly about UFOs.

47:33.574 --> 47:37.744
Many of them were fighter pilots
before they became astronauts,

47:37.745 --> 47:41.247
and they have seen
craft flying as pilots.

47:41.248 --> 47:43.541
Could it be that they've been
pulled aside and told,

47:43.542 --> 47:46.461
"This is all you're allowed
to say and no more,"

47:46.462 --> 47:48.546
because NASA
is trying to silence

47:48.547 --> 47:50.424
these astronauts
from telling the truth?

47:53.927 --> 47:55.720
Another Apollo astronaut

47:55.721 --> 47:59.015
who openly admitted his belief
in extraterrestrial contact

47:59.016 --> 48:01.058
was Edgar Mitchell,

48:01.059 --> 48:03.811
the lunar module pilot
for Apollo 14.

48:03.812 --> 48:07.440
In his later years, he claimed
many of his colleagues

48:07.441 --> 48:10.067
had strange
paranormal experiences

48:10.068 --> 48:13.404
during their missions,
and frequently declared

48:13.405 --> 48:16.574
that most UFO phenomena
are directly connected

48:16.575 --> 48:19.535
to extraterrestrial activity.

48:19.536 --> 48:23.748
I have had no
firsthand personal experience,

48:23.749 --> 48:27.001
but all the evidence from
the research people that I know

48:27.002 --> 48:29.587
from both Europe
and the United States

48:29.588 --> 48:32.381
have investigated
all the sightings

48:32.382 --> 48:35.343
from dozens of years.

48:35.344 --> 48:37.804
And it's pretty sure
it's all true.

48:37.805 --> 48:43.726
I believe that the alien craft,
presuming they're reality...

48:43.727 --> 48:45.728
I think they are,
others think they are...

48:45.729 --> 48:47.897
Have been coming
for a long, long time.

48:47.898 --> 48:51.901
As the sixth person
to walk on the Moon,

48:51.902 --> 48:55.029
Mitchell's opinions concerning
UFOs and their connection

48:55.030 --> 48:59.534
to extraterrestrial encounters
have been difficult to dismiss.

48:59.535 --> 49:01.619
But if otherworldly entities

49:01.620 --> 49:03.663
have been making contact
with us...

49:03.664 --> 49:07.917
Not only for decades
but for centuries...

49:07.918 --> 49:10.546
What is their goal?

49:13.455 --> 49:17.084
July 20, 1969.

49:21.589 --> 49:23.756
Millions of people
around the world

49:23.757 --> 49:25.925
are glued to their televisions

49:25.926 --> 49:29.762
to watch one of the greatest
achievements in human history.

49:29.763 --> 49:32.265
Astronaut Neil Armstrong

49:32.266 --> 49:36.603
is about to become the first
Earth-born extraterrestrial

49:36.604 --> 49:39.940
by stepping foot
on the surface of the Moon.

49:46.530 --> 49:49.073
Although Richard Nixon

49:49.074 --> 49:51.159
is the current president
of the United States,

49:51.160 --> 49:53.411
most give credit to the man

49:53.412 --> 49:55.788
who held the office
six years earlier,

49:55.789 --> 49:58.791
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

49:58.792 --> 50:03.588
Many years ago, the great
British explorer George Mallory,

50:03.589 --> 50:07.300
who was to die on Mount Everest,

50:07.301 --> 50:09.469
was asked why did he want
to climb it.

50:09.470 --> 50:11.804
He said, "Because it is there."

50:11.805 --> 50:14.974
Well, space is there,
and we're going to climb it.

50:14.975 --> 50:18.269
But even as Neil Armstrong

50:18.270 --> 50:20.480
and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin

50:20.481 --> 50:22.940
were still engaged
on their historic mission,

50:22.941 --> 50:26.277
Nixon and the team
at NASA now faced

50:26.278 --> 50:30.448
an even more daunting challenge:
What to do next?

50:30.449 --> 50:32.617
The Moon mission had gripped

50:32.618 --> 50:35.620
the American consciousness
as nothing before,

50:35.621 --> 50:38.206
and even though
a number of return missions

50:38.207 --> 50:40.667
had been planned, there was
nothing on the launch pad

50:40.668 --> 50:43.211
that could top
landing a man on the Moon

50:43.212 --> 50:45.380
as either a national goal

50:45.381 --> 50:48.174
or effective
political propaganda.

50:48.175 --> 50:52.178
To this end, in 1972,

50:52.179 --> 50:55.181
as Nixon began planning
his reelection campaign,

50:55.182 --> 50:58.559
the space shuttle program
was announced.

50:58.560 --> 51:01.020
It was also
during this same time

51:01.021 --> 51:04.148
that the president's
chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman,

51:04.149 --> 51:07.026
proposed the creation
of a documentary film

51:07.027 --> 51:09.862
that would depict Nixon
as being fully committed

51:09.863 --> 51:11.531
to the development of a number

51:11.532 --> 51:14.200
of ambitious
science-based programs.

51:14.201 --> 51:17.203
To produce it, Haldeman turned

51:17.204 --> 51:20.415
to successful advertising
executive-turned-filmmaker

51:20.416 --> 51:23.167
Robert Emenegger.

51:23.168 --> 51:25.545
They knew that Bob
had made promotional films

51:25.546 --> 51:27.714
for the Department of Defense.

51:27.715 --> 51:30.425
So he was contacted and asked

51:30.426 --> 51:32.760
if he would come to a meeting
in Los Angeles

51:32.761 --> 51:34.762
with the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

51:34.763 --> 51:38.516
And they said,
"We need a media consultant.

51:38.517 --> 51:40.560
"We'd like somebody
to come on board

51:40.561 --> 51:43.896
"and make a documentary
that would support Nixon,

51:43.897 --> 51:48.067
"a documentary about
some perhaps secret project

51:48.068 --> 51:50.903
"that the government's
been working on

51:50.904 --> 51:53.573
that can be released
or declassified."

51:53.574 --> 51:56.075
Well, they run around
the country

51:56.076 --> 51:58.661
being shown all sorts
of secret projects.

51:58.662 --> 52:01.539
They went to Wright-Patterson,
and they were shown

52:01.540 --> 52:03.875
very classified
laser experiments.

52:03.876 --> 52:08.796
They were shown dolphins being
trained for demolition work.

52:08.797 --> 52:12.884
They were shown dogs being
trained for various tasks.

52:12.885 --> 52:16.554
Then they were taken
to Norton Air Force Base,

52:16.555 --> 52:20.266
which at that time housed
the Air Force film depository.

52:20.267 --> 52:23.603
Paul Shartle was the director
of the depository.

52:23.604 --> 52:27.857
They were taken into a building
where these films were kept.

52:27.858 --> 52:31.068
They were taken into
what was known as a clean room,

52:31.069 --> 52:34.030
meaning it was free
of any bugs, microphones,

52:34.031 --> 52:36.574
video equipment, anything.

52:36.575 --> 52:40.703
It was during his
meeting at Norton Air Force Base

52:40.704 --> 52:44.290
that Robert Emenegger learned
that Paul Shartle had

52:44.291 --> 52:47.502
a different agenda
from that of the president,

52:47.503 --> 52:49.754
and a different film
in mind than the one

52:49.755 --> 52:53.299
that had been
initially proposed.

52:53.300 --> 52:56.636
Shartle said,
"I'd like to ask you this:

52:56.637 --> 53:01.432
How would you like to make
a documentary on UFOs?"

53:01.433 --> 53:03.184
And Bob Emenegger was stunned.

53:03.185 --> 53:05.436
He told me at his home,

53:05.437 --> 53:07.647
he said, "I didn't know
anything about UFOs."

53:07.648 --> 53:09.065
"I was shocked.

53:09.066 --> 53:12.401
"They said if we would make
the documentary,

53:12.402 --> 53:17.281
"we would be given 600 feet
of 16-millimeter film

53:17.282 --> 53:21.869
shot at Holloman Air Force Base
of a UFO landing there."

53:21.870 --> 53:24.288
For Robert Emenegger,

53:24.289 --> 53:27.124
it was an offer
too good to refuse.

53:27.125 --> 53:28.835
Believing he had
the full support

53:28.836 --> 53:31.212
of both the president
and the military,

53:31.213 --> 53:33.172
he set about to make
the U.S. government's

53:33.173 --> 53:36.843
first official film
on the subject of UFOs.

53:36.844 --> 53:39.720
He quickly recruited
Rod Serling,

53:39.721 --> 53:43.641
Burgess Meredith and José Ferrer
to narrate the film,

53:43.642 --> 53:47.687
and the final explosive scene
was to show actual footage

53:47.688 --> 53:50.690
of an alien encounter.

53:50.691 --> 53:52.650
But when it came time to receive

53:52.651 --> 53:54.819
the incredible footage
he'd been promised,

53:54.820 --> 53:58.364
Emenegger had the government's
once-open door

53:58.365 --> 54:01.325
slammed in his face.

54:01.326 --> 54:05.955
They had been promised
really dramatic footage,

54:05.956 --> 54:09.750
said to be completely legit,
of a UFO landing

54:09.751 --> 54:13.337
at Holloman Air Force Base,
in 1964,

54:13.338 --> 54:15.089
which had alien beings come out,

54:15.090 --> 54:17.550
<i>like The Day the Earth
Stood Still, essentially.</i>

54:17.551 --> 54:21.304
Out came some kind of a ramp.

54:21.305 --> 54:24.557
Our contingent of humans
walked up,

54:24.558 --> 54:26.350
met these two EBENs,

54:26.351 --> 54:29.061
"Extraterrestrial
Biological Entities."

54:29.062 --> 54:34.734
And then in this doorway
was a being unlike the EBENs,

54:34.735 --> 54:37.695
and that it was holding
a rod that had a spiral

54:37.696 --> 54:41.073
that went around the rod,
and that this was used

54:41.074 --> 54:43.951
to communicate with our team.

54:43.952 --> 54:46.412
This was a film

54:46.413 --> 54:48.748
that had four
different vantage points.

54:48.749 --> 54:51.250
They were shooting one from
the air, three on the ground.

54:51.251 --> 54:53.419
And the craft landed,

54:53.420 --> 54:56.547
the aliens came out,
and they stored the craft.

54:56.548 --> 54:58.299
All this was on film.

54:58.300 --> 55:02.386
But on the day
Emenegger was to be given a copy

55:02.387 --> 55:05.097
of the 16-millimeter footage
from the Air Force,

55:05.098 --> 55:08.185
the filmmaker received
an unexpected phone call.

55:10.187 --> 55:13.105
It is one of those
like out of a Hollywood feature.

55:13.106 --> 55:17.276
It's supposed to be coming.
A courier is on the way.

55:17.277 --> 55:19.987
They cannot believe it.
It's really gonna happen.

55:19.988 --> 55:22.448
They're gonna see
all of this film.

55:22.449 --> 55:24.784
And then another phone call:

55:24.785 --> 55:27.912
"We're sorry, the approval
has been rescinded.

55:27.913 --> 55:29.789
No film."

55:29.790 --> 55:33.125
Colonel Coleman
from the Pentagon said,

55:33.126 --> 55:34.752
"The timing isn't right.

55:34.753 --> 55:37.630
We can't allow you
to use the film."

55:37.631 --> 55:39.632
Bob Emenegger was crushed.

55:39.633 --> 55:41.258
He said, "Why?"

55:41.259 --> 55:44.470
And he found out that,
"Making a documentary

55:44.471 --> 55:48.015
"exposing UFOs as being
extraterrestrial

55:48.016 --> 55:52.311
would not help the president,
but conceivably could harm him."

55:52.312 --> 55:55.147
Ultimately, Robert Emenegger

55:55.148 --> 55:58.150
was forced to complete
his documentary

55:58.151 --> 56:01.612
without the sensational footage
he had been promised.

56:01.613 --> 56:02.989
It was a documentary called

56:02.990 --> 56:04.991
<i>Past, Present, and Future.</i>

56:04.992 --> 56:07.159
And they also had a book
by the same name.

56:07.160 --> 56:10.079
As written by Robert Emenegger,

56:10.080 --> 56:13.124
and directed by Ray Rivas,
the documentary

56:13.125 --> 56:16.335
proved to be both popular
and influential.

56:16.336 --> 56:20.172
Even without the smoking gun
footage, it caused a sensation,

56:20.173 --> 56:24.343
and was later credited
as one of the inspirations

56:24.344 --> 56:27.847
behind Steven Spielberg's
1977 blockbuster

56:27.848 --> 56:32.018
<i>Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.</i>

56:32.019 --> 56:34.061
The Robert Emenegger
disclosure effort

56:34.062 --> 56:35.896
is what I call it.

56:35.897 --> 56:38.649
I said, "You know, that film,
Bob, that's very strange."

56:38.650 --> 56:40.860
"You know, if it weren't
for the location,

56:40.861 --> 56:42.528
<i>that's Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."</i>

56:42.529 --> 56:45.156
And he said,
"What, I didn't tell you?"

56:45.157 --> 56:47.408
And I said,
"You didn't tell me what?"

56:47.409 --> 56:49.702
"I didn't tell you I gave a copy
to Steven Spielberg?"

56:49.703 --> 56:51.996
And I said,
"No, you didn't tell me that."

56:51.997 --> 56:55.166
So the documentary
was done in 1975.

56:55.167 --> 56:57.209
<i>Steven Spielberg's Close
Encounters of the Third Kind</i>

56:57.210 --> 57:00.046
came out in 1977.

57:00.047 --> 57:02.548
<i>And so, when you see Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,</i>

57:02.549 --> 57:04.508
it's the Holloman
Air Force Base story,

57:04.509 --> 57:06.218
just changed the location.

57:06.219 --> 57:08.679
It's exactly what the story was.

57:08.680 --> 57:12.058
While the alleged
alien UFO footage

57:12.059 --> 57:15.019
from Holloman Air Force Base
has never surfaced,

57:15.020 --> 57:18.731
many ancient astronaut theorists
believe it still exists,

57:18.732 --> 57:21.233
under lock and key.

57:21.234 --> 57:27.073
What I am really truly expecting
is that somewhere,

57:27.074 --> 57:30.701
from 2018, going forward
in the next decade,

57:30.702 --> 57:37.416
that finally all of that film
is going to be released,

57:37.417 --> 57:41.921
and that we will finally
enter the true history.

57:41.922 --> 57:45.591
Did the U.S. Air Force
really have footage

57:45.592 --> 57:48.052
of secret meetings between
government officials

57:48.053 --> 57:50.638
and extraterrestrials?

57:50.639 --> 57:55.018
And if so, where is it now?

57:59.629 --> 58:01.568
Coming up... For decades,
American presidents

58:01.739 --> 58:05.158
have officially denied that they
have received any information

58:05.159 --> 58:08.161
that extraterrestrials
are visiting Earth.

58:08.162 --> 58:11.748
But considering that the
U.S. government has conducted

58:11.749 --> 58:15.418
at least four major
investigations into UFO activity

58:15.419 --> 58:17.420
since the 1940s,

58:17.421 --> 58:21.591
why has there been so much time
and taxpayer money devoted

58:21.592 --> 58:23.176
to studying something

58:23.177 --> 58:26.471
that the government claims
isn't happening?

58:26.472 --> 58:29.474
We don't know
for an absolute fact

58:29.475 --> 58:32.351
what kind of briefings
presidents actually receive,

58:32.352 --> 58:35.772
when they come into office,
about extraterrestrials.

58:35.773 --> 58:37.482
But we do have some indications

58:37.483 --> 58:39.776
from some documents
that do exist,

58:39.777 --> 58:43.446
one of them being the original
MJ-12 presidential briefing

58:43.447 --> 58:45.156
for President Eisenhower,

58:45.157 --> 58:47.784
telling him all about
the crash at Roswell.

58:48.660 --> 58:52.204
On November 2, 2005,

58:52.205 --> 58:55.374
a document surfaced
that was allegedly a transcript

58:55.375 --> 58:58.293
made from a recorded
presidential briefing

58:58.294 --> 59:03.131
held at Camp David
in March of 1981.

59:03.132 --> 59:07.219
Present were
President Ronald Reagan,

59:07.220 --> 59:09.638
CIA director William Casey,

59:09.639 --> 59:12.140
Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger,

59:12.141 --> 59:16.853
and a mysterious person
known only as "The Caretaker."

59:16.854 --> 59:20.107
According to the document,
during the meeting,

59:20.108 --> 59:22.734
The Caretaker shared
evidence that aliens

59:22.735 --> 59:26.530
have been visiting the Earth
for thousands of years,

59:26.531 --> 59:29.866
and that modern American records
of such encounters

59:29.867 --> 59:35.580
officially began in 1947,
following the Roswell incident.

59:35.581 --> 59:37.708
Certainly,
if you look at Ronald Reagan,

59:37.709 --> 59:40.502
he's somebody who brought up
aliens all the time.

59:40.503 --> 59:43.380
To my mind,
what Reagan is communicating is,

59:43.381 --> 59:46.550
"Yes, Roswell happened.
Yes, it is significant.

59:46.551 --> 59:48.385
"Yes, there are aliens.

59:48.386 --> 59:51.388
"And we'd better
get used to this idea

59:51.389 --> 59:53.724
or figure out
how to deal with them."

59:53.725 --> 59:57.060
I, William Jefferson Clinton...

59:57.061 --> 59:58.895
But it was with the inauguration

59:58.896 --> 01:00:02.899
of President Bill Clinton
in January 1993

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.235
that many UFO researchers
believed

01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:09.531
they finally had an ally
in the White House.

01:00:09.532 --> 01:00:13.910
If the United States Air Force
did recover alien bodies,

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:16.079
they didn't tell me
about it, either,

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.415
and I want to know.

01:00:18.416 --> 01:00:22.085
So, when Bill Clinton
gets into office, he called in

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.962
his presidential aide
Webb Hubbell,

01:00:23.963 --> 01:00:27.299
and the first two things that he
asked for after he was president

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.344
was who killed JFK
and are there aliens.

01:00:31.345 --> 01:00:35.348
Clinton knew that there was
something up about aliens

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:39.060
and UFOs that people
were not being told.

01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:40.937
In his quest to shed light

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.607
on the government's
secret UFO investigations,

01:00:43.608 --> 01:00:46.985
President Clinton found
an unlikely ally

01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:50.614
in billionaire philanthropist
Laurance S. Rockefeller,

01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:53.325
who used his influence
to push full disclosure

01:00:53.326 --> 01:00:57.914
about possible extraterrestrial
activities on Earth.

01:00:59.749 --> 01:01:01.958
The way it started was
Laurance Rockefeller,

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:04.753
who was one of the famous
Rockefeller brothers,

01:01:04.754 --> 01:01:09.257
had been shown a documentary
on Roswell

01:01:09.258 --> 01:01:11.009
and was very interested.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.677
So, the election was going on
at the time,

01:01:12.678 --> 01:01:15.806
and he said, "Whether Ross Perot
wins or George Bush wins"

01:01:15.807 --> 01:01:18.266
"or Bill Clinton wins,
I'm going to the White House

01:01:18.267 --> 01:01:22.771
and I'm going to get them
to disclose the UFO story."

01:01:22.772 --> 01:01:27.692
In 1993, Laurance
Rockefeller began inviting

01:01:27.693 --> 01:01:29.986
a select group
of UFO researchers

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:32.113
and ancient astronaut theorists

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:34.491
to join him
for an important first meeting

01:01:34.492 --> 01:01:39.496
of what would become known
as the Rockefeller Initiative.

01:01:39.497 --> 01:01:43.333
In 1993,
I got a phone call saying,

01:01:43.334 --> 01:01:46.294
"Linda, we'd like you to join

01:01:46.295 --> 01:01:48.296
"a group of your peers

01:01:48.297 --> 01:01:52.467
at Laurance Rockefeller's ranch
at Jackson Hole."

01:01:52.468 --> 01:01:55.345
So, we met.

01:01:55.346 --> 01:01:57.973
There were people
like Robert Bigelow,

01:01:57.974 --> 01:02:00.642
now the head
of Bigelow Aerospace.

01:02:00.643 --> 01:02:05.856
And there were others that were
authors and scientists.

01:02:05.857 --> 01:02:08.275
One of the people
who helped edit the letter

01:02:08.276 --> 01:02:10.861
on UFO disclosure to the
president of the United States

01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:11.987
was Hillary Clinton.

01:02:11.988 --> 01:02:15.657
She was the first lady
at the time.

01:02:15.658 --> 01:02:18.326
Another person
close to Bill Clinton

01:02:18.327 --> 01:02:22.080
who was an advocate for
government investigation of UFOs

01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:23.874
was John Podesta,

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:27.752
who served as the president's
assistant in 1993

01:02:27.753 --> 01:02:33.425
and became his deputy chief
of staff in 1997.

01:02:33.426 --> 01:02:37.387
I've had a long career,
trying to fight

01:02:37.388 --> 01:02:40.557
against government secrecy
and create more openness.

01:02:40.558 --> 01:02:42.893
Right after I left law school,
I started working on that

01:02:42.894 --> 01:02:44.352
at the Department of Justice,

01:02:44.353 --> 01:02:46.062
then at the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:47.856
And then when I worked
for President Clinton

01:02:47.857 --> 01:02:50.025
in the White House,
I was one of the people

01:02:50.026 --> 01:02:51.860
spearheading an initiative,

01:02:51.861 --> 01:02:54.738
to declassify
what turned out to be

01:02:54.739 --> 01:02:56.823
over a billion pages
of documents

01:02:56.824 --> 01:02:59.784
that were resident
at the National Archives.

01:02:59.785 --> 01:03:01.411
In President Clinton's case,

01:03:01.412 --> 01:03:03.580
I think he was interested
in the phenomena.

01:03:03.581 --> 01:03:06.583
He had worked with his then
science advisor Jack Gibbons

01:03:06.584 --> 01:03:09.377
to understand what was going on.

01:03:09.378 --> 01:03:12.297
This correspondence
starts going back and forth

01:03:12.298 --> 01:03:13.590
for three years.

01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:15.759
Rockefeller is putting
immense pressure

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.886
on the White House to disclose.

01:03:17.887 --> 01:03:20.430
Laurance Rockefeller requested

01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:23.934
that the 1947 Roswell incident
be a starting point

01:03:23.935 --> 01:03:26.061
in the government's disclosure.

01:03:26.062 --> 01:03:28.480
They went out
and they reinvestigated Roswell.

01:03:28.481 --> 01:03:30.106
It came back,

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:33.151
and Bill Clinton saw
the final report in 1995.

01:03:33.152 --> 01:03:36.446
President Clinton's one of

01:03:36.447 --> 01:03:38.782
the most curious people
I've ever met.

01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:41.326
I think he wanted to know
what the Air Force knew,

01:03:41.327 --> 01:03:43.620
and got a report back that,
in my view,

01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:46.456
was a little bit unsatisfying.

01:03:46.457 --> 01:03:48.500
He was furious,
from what I was told.

01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:50.919
The Rockefeller Initiative

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.921
was hoping for a revelation,

01:03:52.922 --> 01:03:55.799
but the U.S. Air Force
stuck to its position

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.971
that a crashed weather balloon
caused the Roswell incident.

01:04:00.972 --> 01:04:03.765
Clinton goes
to Belfast, Northern Ireland,

01:04:03.766 --> 01:04:05.850
in November of 1995.

01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:07.519
He's lighting
the Christmas tree,

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.813
and that's when he gives
the famous speech.

01:04:09.814 --> 01:04:12.524
He said he gets
a letter from Ryan,

01:04:12.525 --> 01:04:14.985
which I tried to recover
in an FOIA.

01:04:14.986 --> 01:04:18.405
There is no letter to Ryan.
I think they just made it up.

01:04:18.406 --> 01:04:21.282
He said, "Ryan, if you're out
there in the audience tonight",

01:04:21.283 --> 01:04:23.243
here's the answer
to your question."

01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:24.661
No.

01:04:24.662 --> 01:04:27.831
As far as I know,
an alien spacecraft

01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:31.334
did not crash
in Roswell, New Mexico.

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:35.171
And, Ryan,
if the United States Air Force

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.799
did recover alien bodies,

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.303
they didn't tell me about it,
either, and I want to know.

01:04:42.304 --> 01:04:46.599
That's why in 1997
the U.S. Air Force goes out

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.227
and does a second
Roswell report,

01:04:49.228 --> 01:04:50.687
spends $20 million on it,

01:04:50.688 --> 01:04:52.522
because the president
was furious.

01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:55.233
According to the revised report,

01:04:55.234 --> 01:04:58.820
the so-called alien bodies
that eyewitnesses claimed

01:04:58.821 --> 01:05:00.947
they saw being pulled
from the wreckage

01:05:00.948 --> 01:05:05.201
were dismissed as being nothing
more than crash test dummies

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.537
which had been tethered
to parachutes being used

01:05:07.538 --> 01:05:10.373
in an otherwise
conventional test.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:13.877
Dr. Gibbons pressed
first the Secretary of Defense

01:05:13.878 --> 01:05:16.171
Les Aspen, and then
the Secretary of the Air Force,

01:05:16.172 --> 01:05:19.382
to take this matter seriously,
to do a review.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.384
The boxes were missing.
The documents were gone.

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.553
Nobody knew anything.

01:05:23.554 --> 01:05:27.933
And, you know, the...
the trail kind of went cold.

01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:31.561
In 1996,

01:05:31.562 --> 01:05:35.231
the Rockefeller Initiative
was quietly closed,

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:36.858
and its participants...

01:05:36.859 --> 01:05:38.693
Frustrated that forces
within the government

01:05:38.694 --> 01:05:41.404
still refused
to reveal the truth...

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:45.617
Went away without the answers
they'd hoped for.

01:05:45.618 --> 01:05:48.536
The Rockefeller Initiative is
considered by some researchers

01:05:48.537 --> 01:05:51.998
to be the biggest
government UFO disclosure story

01:05:51.999 --> 01:05:53.583
of all times.

01:05:53.584 --> 01:05:55.752
The fact that it even existed,

01:05:55.753 --> 01:05:58.463
that it was sanctioned
in any way by the government,

01:05:58.464 --> 01:06:00.590
that the report was accepted

01:06:00.591 --> 01:06:02.592
by the White House
and people in the government,

01:06:02.593 --> 01:06:04.928
I think is very,
very highly significant.

01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:07.597
So it's kind of a very small
incremental step forward

01:06:07.598 --> 01:06:09.974
in the process of disclosure

01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:13.394
and moving us
towards the ultimate answers

01:06:13.395 --> 01:06:15.815
to the questions
that we're all asking.

01:06:17.709 --> 01:06:21.378
Washington, D.C.

01:06:21.379 --> 01:06:24.715
July 1996.

01:06:24.716 --> 01:06:27.218
Political activist
Stephen Bassett

01:06:27.219 --> 01:06:29.261
becomes the first registered

01:06:29.262 --> 01:06:31.764
extraterrestrial life
and disclosure lobbyist

01:06:31.765 --> 01:06:34.433
in the United States.

01:06:34.434 --> 01:06:37.603
For years,
he had been trying to organize

01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:39.939
a hearing
with members of Congress

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.775
to present evidence
that the government was hiding

01:06:42.776 --> 01:06:46.153
important information
from its people.

01:06:46.154 --> 01:06:50.658
The extraterrestrial presence,
if formally acknowledged,

01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:53.619
could bring in an age of reform,
where the human race

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.246
could get its act together,

01:06:55.247 --> 01:06:57.123
because we're
running out of time.

01:06:57.124 --> 01:07:00.459
As I got into the issue,

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.838
what I learned is
just how dysfunctional

01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:07.007
the United States government
had become.

01:07:07.008 --> 01:07:09.593
It is the vast expanse
of secrecy

01:07:09.594 --> 01:07:12.179
and abuse of secrecy in power
that is lying

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.474
at the base of a great deal
of our problems.

01:07:15.475 --> 01:07:20.229
And so I had
one simple fundamental task:

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:22.481
formal acknowledgment of
the extraterrestrial presence,

01:07:22.482 --> 01:07:24.817
simple, clean and easy.

01:07:24.818 --> 01:07:27.653
Gentlemen, if you
could stand and repeat after me?

01:07:27.654 --> 01:07:32.867
On April 29, 2013,
Bassett organized

01:07:32.868 --> 01:07:36.495
the Citizen Hearing on
Disclosure in Washington, D.C.

01:07:36.496 --> 01:07:39.165
The objective was
to bring together

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:43.544
the most compelling evidence of
extraterrestrial visits to Earth

01:07:43.545 --> 01:07:46.005
and convince former members
of Congress

01:07:46.006 --> 01:07:47.715
to take immediate action.

01:07:47.716 --> 01:07:50.843
I had wanted
to do it since 2001...

01:07:50.844 --> 01:07:54.221
Bring in 42 witnesses,
from ten countries,

01:07:54.222 --> 01:07:58.309
to testify in the main ballroom
of the National Press Club,

01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:01.395
before six former members
of the Congress,

01:08:01.396 --> 01:08:04.690
five congresspersons,
one senator.

01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:09.028
And they testified
for 30 hours over five days.

01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:11.197
It was an amazing event,

01:08:11.198 --> 01:08:15.534
mostly because of the caliber of
witnesses that were brought in,

01:08:15.535 --> 01:08:17.870
the investigators, researchers.

01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:19.872
They don't want you
to know that.

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:22.166
Witnesses
included John Callahan,

01:08:22.167 --> 01:08:23.667
former division chief

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:26.045
of the Accidents
and Investigations Branch

01:08:26.046 --> 01:08:28.296
of the FAA,

01:08:28.298 --> 01:08:31.716
the former Canadian Minister
of Defence, Paul Hellyer,

01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:35.220
retired Air Force captain
Robert Salas,

01:08:35.221 --> 01:08:38.557
and many others who had
conducted extensive research

01:08:38.558 --> 01:08:40.392
into the UFO phenomenon.

01:08:40.393 --> 01:08:43.395
We live in a cosmos
teeming with life.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:45.689
The fact that
some other civilizations

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.733
are more advanced than we are
may be humbling,

01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:51.319
but that could be a necessary
step in our survival.

01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:54.782
People are so afraid
for their lives, their families,

01:08:54.783 --> 01:08:58.786
because they have had to sign
nondisclosure agreements.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:09:02.747
Witness from
the U.K., Nick Pope.

01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:04.250
Thank you.

01:09:04.251 --> 01:09:05.917
Um, you should all have
a printed-out copy

01:09:05.919 --> 01:09:07.627
of my opening statement.

01:09:07.629 --> 01:09:10.673
I was one of the
witnesses, and I have to say,

01:09:10.674 --> 01:09:14.260
this was the nearest
that we've gotten since,

01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:17.263
oh, way back to the '70s
and the '60s, even,

01:09:17.264 --> 01:09:21.975
to proper congressional hearings
on the UFO mystery.

01:09:21.977 --> 01:09:25.938
You did work for the Ministry
of Defence in the U.K.?

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:28.107
That's correct, sir, yes.

01:09:28.108 --> 01:09:31.234
I was asked about my experience

01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:34.571
within the British government's
UFO program,

01:09:34.572 --> 01:09:37.116
and one of the U.K.'s
most high-profile cases,

01:09:37.117 --> 01:09:39.618
the Rendlesham Forest incident.

01:09:39.618 --> 01:09:42.871
In December 1980,

01:09:42.872 --> 01:09:46.166
there were unexplained reports
of a glowing craft in the woods

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:49.670
of Royal Air Force Base,
Woodbridge.

01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:54.300
Burn marks and broken branches
were later discovered.

01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:58.095
Some have called this incident
"Britain's Roswell."

01:09:58.096 --> 01:10:01.765
Even though I've left
government, I responded with,

01:10:01.766 --> 01:10:04.810
"I can neither confirm
nor deny."

01:10:04.811 --> 01:10:07.438
I don't think
the committee liked

01:10:07.439 --> 01:10:10.274
my "neither confirm nor deny"
response,

01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:12.651
and they pushed me
very hard on that.

01:10:12.652 --> 01:10:15.154
Certainly, you've been involved
since you left.

01:10:15.155 --> 01:10:16.822
Yes, sir, in a private capacity.

01:10:16.823 --> 01:10:18.073
What's your opinion,

01:10:18.074 --> 01:10:20.409
based on all that stuff
that you've had access to?

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:21.952
Is there an E.T. origin

01:10:21.953 --> 01:10:26.540
to what's obvious sightings
of real UFOs?

01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:29.001
It is a... a possibility.

01:10:29.002 --> 01:10:31.670
You could tell by the faces,

01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:34.673
they really weren't quite sure
what to think of this yet.

01:10:34.674 --> 01:10:38.385
By Wednesday, we have them,
you know, standing up,

01:10:38.386 --> 01:10:42.014
pointing fingers, saying,
"We need to open those files."

01:10:42.015 --> 01:10:44.850
It drove things forward.

01:10:44.851 --> 01:10:47.811
It took the UFO phenomenon
out of the fringe

01:10:47.812 --> 01:10:49.521
and into the mainstream.

01:10:49.522 --> 01:10:52.358
Thousands of people
watched it online.

01:10:52.359 --> 01:10:54.193
We netcast it so that

01:10:54.194 --> 01:10:56.195
members of Congress
and their staff

01:10:56.196 --> 01:10:58.989
who were too timid
to come down and watch it there,

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:00.824
or members of the press
that were afraid

01:11:00.825 --> 01:11:02.493
that they might be seen
watching it,

01:11:02.494 --> 01:11:04.536
could watch it in the comfort
of their offices.

01:11:04.537 --> 01:11:08.332
Sometime this year,
we may just enter a new world.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:09.917
Thank you so much.

01:11:09.918 --> 01:11:11.960
Based on the hearings,

01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:14.713
four of the six
former members of Congress

01:11:14.714 --> 01:11:17.716
pledged their support
to hold a world conference,

01:11:17.717 --> 01:11:20.052
in conjunction
with the United Nations,

01:11:20.053 --> 01:11:22.179
to address the disclosure

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.681
of all knowledge
of extraterrestrial contact

01:11:24.682 --> 01:11:26.226
with this planet.

01:11:27.727 --> 01:11:31.105
Then, on August 15, 2013,

01:11:31.106 --> 01:11:34.692
less than four months after the
Citizen Hearing on Disclosure,

01:11:34.693 --> 01:11:39.738
the United States government
made a shocking admission.

01:11:39.739 --> 01:11:42.116
After decades
of denying its existence,

01:11:42.117 --> 01:11:44.701
they finally admitted
that a secret base

01:11:44.702 --> 01:11:48.247
known as Area 51 did exist.

01:11:48.248 --> 01:11:51.333
Did the Citizen Hearing
on Disclosure

01:11:51.334 --> 01:11:54.461
force the U.S. government
to act?

01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:56.296
While the government
acknowledged

01:11:56.297 --> 01:12:00.676
the existence of Area 51,
it still has not been revealed

01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:04.304
just what it is
currently being used for.

01:12:04.305 --> 01:12:05.931
And since that disclosure,

01:12:05.932 --> 01:12:08.767
the perimeter around the base
has been extended

01:12:08.768 --> 01:12:12.104
and security heightened.

01:12:12.105 --> 01:12:15.607
Area 51 has to be
more secretive now,

01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:18.110
because you got
so many other concerns.

01:12:18.111 --> 01:12:21.155
We didn't have computers
to worry about, Internet,

01:12:21.156 --> 01:12:23.699
all that sort of thing
that you've got today.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.285
So it's a brand-new ball game
as far as security.

01:12:26.286 --> 01:12:29.580
While many considered
the government's admission

01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:33.125
of the existence of Area 51
to be a bombshell,

01:12:33.126 --> 01:12:36.795
an even bigger disclosure
was still to come:

01:12:36.796 --> 01:12:42.760
the declassification of millions
of top secret CIA documents.

01:12:47.186 --> 01:12:48.854
Bethesda, Maryland.

01:12:48.855 --> 01:12:51.732
November 2014.

01:12:51.733 --> 01:12:53.650
Stephen Bassett,

01:12:53.651 --> 01:12:57.404
executive director
of the Paradigm Research Group,

01:12:57.405 --> 01:13:01.867
launches an initiative directed
to influence Hillary Clinton.

01:13:01.868 --> 01:13:04.745
Based on Clinton's work
with Laurance Rockefeller

01:13:04.746 --> 01:13:06.788
in the 1990s,

01:13:06.789 --> 01:13:09.291
Bassett believes
she could be an ally

01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:13.962
in getting the government
to declassify its UFO files.

01:13:13.963 --> 01:13:17.299
That political initiative
was begun

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.718
by sending a full copy

01:13:19.719 --> 01:13:22.888
of the 30 hours of testimony
to every member of Congress,

01:13:22.889 --> 01:13:27.142
addressing the Rockefeller
Initiative, naming names...

01:13:27.143 --> 01:13:31.021
Secretary Clinton,
President Clinton, John Podesta,

01:13:31.022 --> 01:13:32.731
George Stephanopoulos,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:36.318
That testimony created
a very significant dilemma

01:13:36.319 --> 01:13:38.695
for the Clinton campaign team.

01:13:38.696 --> 01:13:44.618
The political initiative forces
the Clinton campaign team,

01:13:44.619 --> 01:13:47.204
which included Barack Obama...
He was on the team...

01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:49.665
To speak to the issue.

01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:53.878
Are we ready to go win
an election in November?

01:13:55.505 --> 01:13:58.548
Clinton's campaign
chairman, John Podesta,

01:13:58.549 --> 01:14:01.134
is well known
for his interest in UFO

01:14:01.135 --> 01:14:06.474
and extraterrestrial encounters,
and according to him, so is she.

01:14:08.226 --> 01:14:10.519
Secretary Clinton, likewise,

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.646
was also kind of interested
in the topic,

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:15.607
and during the course
of the campaign said

01:14:15.608 --> 01:14:17.693
that, if elected,
she would have ordered

01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:20.529
a more thorough
declassification review.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:23.198
She was very open.
She did not skirt the issue.

01:14:23.199 --> 01:14:24.866
She talked about it very openly.

01:14:24.867 --> 01:14:28.203
Many believe
that had Clinton won,

01:14:28.204 --> 01:14:30.080
there would have been
a seismic shift

01:14:30.081 --> 01:14:32.958
from the government's
long-held policy of secrecy

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:39.047
concerning UFO investigations to
a new policy of full disclosure.

01:14:39.048 --> 01:14:41.675
The system of regulation

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:45.762
that creates our secrecy
system... what's top secret,

01:14:45.763 --> 01:14:48.849
what's confidential, these
lower levels of classification...

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:52.936
That's regulated and has been
since the Truman administration

01:14:52.937 --> 01:14:55.272
by executive order
of the president.

01:14:55.273 --> 01:15:00.485
The president sets forward the
general rules of classification.

01:15:00.486 --> 01:15:02.738
And some presidents
have been more forthcoming,

01:15:02.739 --> 01:15:04.531
wanted less secrecy.

01:15:04.532 --> 01:15:08.618
Some have tightened the reins
and wanted more secrecy.

01:15:08.619 --> 01:15:09.745
It makes a difference.

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:12.497
The CIA and the Pentagon...

01:15:12.498 --> 01:15:16.001
They were worried about Hillary
Clinton, Secretary Clinton,

01:15:16.002 --> 01:15:18.670
all the statements she was
making, winning the presidency,

01:15:18.671 --> 01:15:20.589
and going to the Pentagon
and basically saying,

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.674
"You are going to give me
the information I need

01:15:22.675 --> 01:15:24.384
"to disclose
the extraterrestrial presence,

01:15:24.385 --> 01:15:27.054
or I'm gonna fire
every single one of you."

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:32.350
As this year of 2016
went forward, we all expected

01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:35.312
that this headline
that we've been waiting for

01:15:35.313 --> 01:15:38.982
that is going
to break the protocol,

01:15:38.983 --> 01:15:43.195
break the policy of denial,
was going to happen.

01:15:43.196 --> 01:15:46.156
John Podesta was trying
to get ready

01:15:46.157 --> 01:15:49.159
to open up that we're not alone
in the universe.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.912
All of that crashed

01:15:51.913 --> 01:15:56.333
when a different person became
President of the United States.

01:15:56.334 --> 01:16:00.212
November 8, 2016,

01:16:00.213 --> 01:16:04.007
Donald Trump was elected
as America's next president.

01:16:04.008 --> 01:16:08.303
There would be no disclosure
of the secret UFO files.

01:16:08.304 --> 01:16:13.475
I've had a number of
members of Congress,

01:16:13.476 --> 01:16:16.728
members of the U.S. Senate
say to me, "Keep going at this."

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:19.648
I'm really interested in it, but
I can't say anything about it."

01:16:19.649 --> 01:16:22.234
But as a longtime advisor

01:16:22.235 --> 01:16:24.236
to President Barack Obama,

01:16:24.237 --> 01:16:27.948
John Podesta still had an ally
in the White House,

01:16:27.949 --> 01:16:31.452
one who would remain there
for another two months.

01:16:35.289 --> 01:16:39.376
January 17, 2017.

01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:42.337
In Barack Obama's
last days as president,

01:16:42.338 --> 01:16:45.173
the CIA posts on its website

01:16:45.174 --> 01:16:48.927
nearly 13 million pages
of agency documents,

01:16:48.928 --> 01:16:52.472
many of which pertain to UFOs.

01:16:52.473 --> 01:16:57.435
It was a very, very big deal,
and people were excited.

01:16:57.436 --> 01:17:02.065
All of these things
were efforts, I believe,

01:17:02.066 --> 01:17:04.609
to educate people and to move us

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:10.115
in a direction that we can
accept, as a society,

01:17:10.116 --> 01:17:12.993
that extraterrestrials are here

01:17:12.994 --> 01:17:16.706
and have been here
for thousands of years.

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:22.961
Investigator Chase
Kloetzke and author Nick Pope

01:17:22.962 --> 01:17:25.088
have been searching for proof

01:17:25.089 --> 01:17:27.507
that the U.S. government has
been hiding its interactions

01:17:27.508 --> 01:17:29.468
with extraterrestrials.

01:17:29.469 --> 01:17:32.679
Now they hope to find
new evidence among

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.433
the millions
of recently declassified pages.

01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:38.101
Well, there's such a lot
to go through.

01:17:38.102 --> 01:17:40.937
Exactly. It comes back
to the old saying,

01:17:40.938 --> 01:17:44.149
the best place
to hide a book is in a library.

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:48.278
And there are all sorts of gems
in here, I'm sure,

01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:50.113
but, um, how would we ever know?

01:17:50.114 --> 01:17:52.532
We've got to go through it
literally page by page,

01:17:52.533 --> 01:17:54.409
- line by line.
- Right.

01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:57.204
So we're taking a look
at this report.

01:17:57.402 --> 01:17:59.611
December 1960.

01:17:59.612 --> 01:18:01.571
This has come from Detroit,

01:18:01.572 --> 01:18:06.743
and it's a sighting of
unidentified objects in the sky.

01:18:06.744 --> 01:18:09.913
"Like a disc," it says,

01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:12.207
which again, is something
I'm sure you've come across

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:14.000
in-in various reports,
as have I.

01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:15.460
Yes, many.

01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:17.796
And yet,
it has these redactions on it.

01:18:17.797 --> 01:18:19.923
And again,
the question arises: Why?

01:18:19.924 --> 01:18:24.261
If this subject is so
unclassified and unimportant,

01:18:24.262 --> 01:18:26.012
why all these redactions?

01:18:26.013 --> 01:18:28.598
- And this next document.
- Oh, wow. That's crazy.

01:18:28.599 --> 01:18:31.643
Right? Why even bother?

01:18:31.644 --> 01:18:35.230
Only information is... the date.

01:18:35.231 --> 01:18:37.607
13 million documents.

01:18:37.608 --> 01:18:40.527
If there really was
a smoking gun in there,

01:18:40.528 --> 01:18:42.989
it would be
almost impossible to find.

01:18:46.492 --> 01:18:49.661
So far,
the CIA archive has revealed

01:18:49.662 --> 01:18:51.746
thousands of reports
of sightings

01:18:51.747 --> 01:18:53.999
of unexplained aircraft.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.419
One report said that,
of 1,500 official accounts

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.255
of UFOs since 1947,

01:19:00.256 --> 01:19:04.843
an incredible 20%
remain unexplained.

01:19:04.844 --> 01:19:08.722
But was the release
of the CIA online archive

01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:14.269
another step towards disclosure
or a way to bury the truth?

01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:17.772
When the Pentagon's
classified study into UFOs...

01:19:17.773 --> 01:19:20.817
The Advanced Aerial Threat
Identification Program...

01:19:20.818 --> 01:19:24.488
Was uncovered later in 2017,

01:19:24.489 --> 01:19:26.656
journalists
and researchers rushed

01:19:26.657 --> 01:19:30.076
to file Freedom of Information
Act requests.

01:19:30.077 --> 01:19:34.707
Will these files finally explain
what the government knows?

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.109
11 months after
the CIA's archive

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.778
is released
to the public in 2017,

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.447
<i>The New York Times story reveals</i>

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.533
the Department of Defense's

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:52.454
or Advanced Aerospace Threat
Identification Program.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.084
As soon as the story breaks,

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:00.628
journalists and researchers
start filing

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:05.133
Freedom of Information Act
requests, known as FOIA.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:12.014
There have now been 1,500 to
2,000 FOIAs on this program...

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:14.058
$22 million program...

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.018
And the government
at this point is saying,

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:17.395
"Program? What program?"

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:18.980
They're playing
the same old game.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.481
"We didn't release those films."

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.983
But they're under
so much pressure.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.485
If this keeps up for even

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.529
four, five or six more months,

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:31.159
I do not imagine how
disclosure can not take place.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.704
Much of what was
undertaken and reviewed

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:37.039
still remains in the dark,

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.334
in classified form
at the Department of Defense.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:43.004
I would hope that
they would declassify it

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.839
and release as much as possible.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.091
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:50.011
<i>When this story broke
in The New York Times...</i>

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.929
- Jordan.
- ...guy by the name of

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.391
<i>Jordan Fabian from The Hill...
he asks Sarah Sanders</i>

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.643
the $64,000 question.

01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:00.605
Does the president believe
in the existence of UFOs,

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.523
and would he be interested

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.025
in restoring funding
for that program?

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.068
Somehow that question
hasn't come up

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:09.197
in our back and forth over the
last couple days, but I will,

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:13.409
uh, check into that and be happy
to circle back. Jennifer?

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.370
As far as I know,
she has never come back around,

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:18.039
because you can't.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.124
The president
has to stay out of it.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.252
They want the community
to force the issue.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.087
They want us to force the issue.

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:28.883
And that is why they moved it
to Bob Bigelow,

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.636
who's a contractor in Las Vegas.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.722
It's private industry
that will do the disclosure.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.099
History is
about to happen at a level

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.145
that's almost incalculable,
extraordinary, unprecedented.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.899
It makes something like
the Roman Empire look trivial.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.109
So, just think about that.

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.070
The announcement of
the extraterrestrial presence,

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.863
worldwide engagement,

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.950
open contacts
with multiple civilizations.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:58.246
The revelations
about AATIP may be clues

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:00.414
that there's an agenda here.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:04.001
This may be government trying

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:07.421
to slowly drip-feed this
information out to the public

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:11.300
in such a way that there
won't be out-and-out panic.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:13.511
It may be a way

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:18.766
of slowly but surely
acclimatizing people

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:21.602
to the reality
of this phenomenon.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:25.356
<i>The fact that
The New York Times published</i>

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:28.693
a Pentagon story
is extraordinary.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:32.363
And nobody really cared, so,

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:37.368
to me, that means that
while we are all talking about

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.121
that we may be connected
to extraterrestrials,

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.124
that this knowledge
is within us.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:47.545
It's hardwired, so that,
hey, if they're coming,

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:50.881
it won't be panic
because we come from them.

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:54.969
I do think that the world is
ready for this knowledge,

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:59.056
and I think that it would be
the most revolutionary story

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.393
in the history of mankind.

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:06.856
Has the time finally come

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:09.358
when not only
the United States government

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:14.155
but nations around the world
will reveal what UFO researchers

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:18.075
and ancient astronaut theorists
have long suspected:

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:21.162
that extraterrestrial visitation
of our planet

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.206
is not only real,
but has been happening

01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:26.542
for thousands of years?

01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:31.422
There are many who believe
the answer is a profound yes,

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.675
and that the truth will lead
to a greater understanding

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:39.847
not only of mankind's past,
but of its future,

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.933
a future that will see humans

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:46.062
as the torchbearers
of a new generation,

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:51.025
and as the extraterrestrial
visitors of planets and galaxies

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.528
far beyond our own.
