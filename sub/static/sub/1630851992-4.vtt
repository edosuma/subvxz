00:01.668 --> 00:03.003
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.987 --> 00:30.989
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.991
(SIGHS) It always ends in a fight.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.374
You don't know when to give up,
do you?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.501
-(GRUNTING)
-BUCKY: Hey!

00:42.835 --> 00:44.253
Pick on somebody your own size.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.173
Thank you, Buck.
But I can get by on my own.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.843
You don't have to.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.805
I'm with you
till the end of the line, pal.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.058
You get your orders?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.142
The 107th.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.019
Sergeant James Barnes,

01:01.103 --> 01:03.146
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

01:03.647 --> 01:04.690
STEVE: I should be going.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.533
(GASPING)

01:18.871 --> 01:21.415
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.417
Yeah, and I threw up?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.211
This isn't payback, is it?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.759
-(WEAPON POWERING UP)
-Get down!

01:39.683 --> 01:40.767
(GRUNTING)

01:41.351 --> 01:43.395
(SCREAMING) Bucky, no!

01:51.695 --> 01:52.988
ARNIM ZOLA: Sergeant Barnes.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.829
You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.165
Put him on ice.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.212
NATASHA: The Winter Soldier.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.715
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

02:11.798 --> 02:13.467
in the last 50 years.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.890
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.146
You shaped the century.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.567
-(GRUNTING)
-And I need you to do it one more time.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.822
SAM: He doesn't know you.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.991
He will.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.287
Please don't make me do this.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.592
You know me.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.010
WINTER SOLDIER: No, I don't!

02:57.094 --> 02:58.428
You've known me your whole life.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.391
You're my friend.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.018
(GRUNTING)

03:05.102 --> 03:06.228
You're my mission.

03:07.938 --> 03:08.939
STEVE: Then finish it.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.108
(BOTH PANTING)

03:12.651 --> 03:14.862
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.410
HELMUT ZEMO: (ON TV)
I'm not here to judge you.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.829
I just want to ask you a few questions.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.999
Do you know where you are, James?

03:30.252 --> 03:31.420
My name is Bucky.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.174
HELMUT ZEMO: Tell me, Bucky.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.509
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.219
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723

04:11.126 --> 04:12.127
SAM: Hey, Cap!

04:14.838 --> 04:15.839
BUCKY: Steve.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.509
Which Bucky am I talking to?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.429
Your mom's name was Sarah.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.895
You used to wear newspapers
under your shoes. (CHUCKLING)

04:31.939 --> 04:33.106
Can't read that in a museum.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.150
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?

04:35.234 --> 04:36.401
What did I do?

04:44.910 --> 04:45.911
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

04:51.708 --> 04:53.460
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.966
STEVE: What you did all those years...

04:59.049 --> 05:00.300
(ENGINE REVVING)

05:01.093 --> 05:02.177
...it wasn't you.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.186
Please. Help.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.771
STEVE: You didn't have a choice.

05:12.855 --> 05:13.856
I know.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.568
But I did it.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.208
(GASPING)

05:40.132 --> 05:41.133
TONY: Did you know?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.468
(GRUNTING)

05:49.725 --> 05:51.768
It wasn't him.
HYDRA had control of his mind.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.978
Move!

05:54.313 --> 05:56.023
STEVE: This won't change what happened.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.691
TONY: I don't care.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.818
He killed my mom.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.695
(BOTH GRUNTING)

06:04.531 --> 06:05.699
(GROANING)

06:19.963 --> 06:21.006
STEVE: You sure about this?

06:21.965 --> 06:24.134
BUCKY: Everything HYDRA put inside me
is still there.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.262
I can't trust my own mind.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.767
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

06:31.850 --> 06:33.977
I think going back under
is the best thing.

06:34.978 --> 06:35.979
For everybody.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.029
OKOYE: What of this one?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.864
T'CHALLA: This one may be tired of war.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.660
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.166
Where's the fight?

06:58.710 --> 06:59.795
T'CHALLA: On its way.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.925
God, I love this place.

Come and get some, space dogs!

07:24.903 --> 07:27.447
Come on! Get some! Get some!

07:27.531 --> 07:29.116
Come on, get some.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.827
-How much for the gun?
-Not for sale.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.329
Okay, how much for the arm?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.708
Oh, I'll get that arm.
