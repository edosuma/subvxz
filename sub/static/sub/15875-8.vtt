08:32.611 --> 08:33.847
Mark Carrano is
looking for you two.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.948
Oh.
OK.

08:34.948 --> 08:35.849
Cool.
-Hey, Brie.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.017
Hey, how are you?

08:37.017 --> 08:37.817
Pardon me.

08:37.817 --> 08:38.618
Coming through.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.352
Well, you two have fun.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.688
Did you two get in trouble?

08:41.688 --> 08:42.489
No!

08:42.489 --> 08:43.289
I hope not.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.157
Doing naughty things.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.492
I hope not.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.994
Bye, girl.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.496
Oh, we never get
called in to here.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.296
Yeah.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.097
I know.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.098
It's the good girl's room.

08:52.098 --> 08:52.899
How you doing?

08:52.899 --> 08:54.601
What's going on?

08:54.601 --> 08:55.402
I don't know.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.403
You tell us.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.839
We have an opportunity we want
to run by you guys about making

08:59.839 --> 09:01.708
you guys a tag team.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.509
No way.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.643
Because, here's
what we're doing.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.879
We want to take advantage
of your star power

09:05.879 --> 09:07.013
and putting you guys together.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.281
Two's always better than one.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.649
You think it's a good idea?
-Yeah.

09:09.649 --> 09:10.583
We just don't know exactly.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.384
Thanks, Mark.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.620
I need you guys to think
about it for a couple.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.788
Go home, play some ideas.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.622
Oh, we can have ideas.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.491
I'm talking color
schemes, clothing ideas.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.526
A little red and gold action.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.326
Yeah.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.327
Red and gold.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.329
I'm like through the roof.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.432
The WWE wants to
give Summer and I

09:25.432 --> 09:29.369
a test run of being this
amazing tag team partnership.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.472
I'm so new that I can't even
believe that they even want

09:32.472 --> 09:33.773
to give me this opportunity.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.708
The Funkadactyls are great
and the Bellas are great.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.042
Yeah.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.243
It's true, but
it's also business.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.378
Look out for you guys.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.046
Look out for number one.

09:40.046 --> 09:40.847
OK.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.815
Thank you!

09:41.815 --> 09:42.816
Thank you for coming by.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.584
Oh, you about broke my
hand with that handshake.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.252
You're so strong, Mark.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.220
Thank you so much.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.254
I got to pack the bags
and get ready to go.

09:48.254 --> 09:48.788
OK.
Thank you.

09:48.788 --> 09:49.589
Yay.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.193
That's really good news.

09:53.193 --> 09:53.993
Yes.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.929
I feel like when people usually
get called in to Carrano's

09:55.929 --> 09:57.697
office it's for bad stuff.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.966
We should get into ring, too.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.501
Because I'm not
sure what you do.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.069
You don't know what I do.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.071
Duh, I need to get in the
ring as much as possible.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.174
So we can just get in the ring
and kind of like learn what

10:08.174 --> 10:09.342
we want to do tag team wise.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.143
Absolutely.

10:10.143 --> 10:10.944
Oh, good.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.879
Yay!

10:12.879 --> 10:13.680
OK.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.481
Awesome.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.649
I need to go pick
up my stuff, too.

10:16.649 --> 10:17.884
Me, too.

10:17.884 --> 10:18.852
ANNOUNCER: Uh oh, Tamina!

10:18.852 --> 10:21.821
Oh, right to the
back of the neck!

10:21.821 --> 10:23.323
I can't do that.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.291
Naomi going up high!

10:25.291 --> 10:26.793
Oh.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.761
The cover.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.231
Naomi got her.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.199
[CHEERING]

10:33.199 --> 10:35.168
That's a big win for Naomi.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.636
A huge win!

10:36.636 --> 10:39.439
She could be the greatest
among the Divas division.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.641
But will she get a shot
at the Divas championship?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.042
Only time will tell.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.711
Very impressive here tonight.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.013
Funk is on a roll on Friday!

10:47.013 --> 10:47.814
Hey, girl.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.249
So what did
Carrano have to say?

10:49.249 --> 10:50.350
Did you get in trouble?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.151
No.

10:51.151 --> 10:55.788
Carrano said possibly Summer and
me teaming up to be a tag team.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.090
It could be good, right?

10:57.090 --> 10:57.924
I don't know.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.492
I'd be careful with that one.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.994
I never know what
she's up to, you know?

11:00.994 --> 11:01.794
Mm-hm.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.197
And it's like she's one who
is just always all for herself.

11:04.197 --> 11:08.334
Like, she's going to try to
use you to get one step higher.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.669
BRIE: I've been in
this business a while

11:09.669 --> 11:11.004
and I know when
girls are hungry.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.673
And Summer is all for herself.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.810
She will take anyone down
to get one step ahead.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.245
I think that girl
will try to bury you.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.080
Bury you alive.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.316
I'm keeping my fingers
crossed that she doesn't.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.754
Two arms.
I'm not going to tell you.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.055
You're supposed
to be practicing.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.423
This as a lot of pressure.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.759
So even I need to be
at the top of our game.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.294
I don't want you to think
that I'm nitpicking.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.930
I'm here trying and
you know my schedule.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.432
I have just as busy
a schedule as you do.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.167
ANNOUNCER: Funk is on a roll!

11:41.167 --> 11:44.504
I'm on my way to becoming
the next Divas champion.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.438
ANNOUNCER: Ow.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.839
Did you see that?

11:46.839 --> 11:48.208
She looks like
she's really hurt.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.043
NAOMI: She comes down with
her knee and I hear a crack.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.556
Hi.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.491
Hey.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.559
This is cool.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.360
Isn't it?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.161
Yeah.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.295
I like this.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.531
I'm really grateful
today because Summer's

12:11.531 --> 12:14.067
taking some time out and
hopping in the ring with me.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.536
I think Summer and I
could be a great tag team.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.905
She's been in developmental
a lot longer than I have.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.974
So she's teaching me
some of the moves.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.910
We can just like work off of
what you know and what I know.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.245
Even just like small stuff.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.079
What about kicking out?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.448
Let's do kicking out strong.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.249
Yeah.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.049
That's great.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.288
What about like
a rear chin lock?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.590
I can put you down here.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.424
I can bring you back up.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.225
Oh, yeah.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.294
Oh, girl.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.664
WWE has me on such a
crazy, hectic schedule

12:44.664 --> 12:47.433
that I don't get to train
as much as I would like to.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.470
A normal person usually
spends at least two

12:50.470 --> 12:52.872
years in developmental or NXT.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.142
And, in my case, I've probably
had four weeks on my tryout,

12:56.142 --> 12:58.845
and then two weeks consistently,
and then hit the road.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.281
I think if we just concentrate
on the basics with us

13:01.281 --> 13:05.318
and polish it, I think we can
be like a dominant tag team.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.086
We can be those bad girls.

13:07.086 --> 13:07.887
Oh [BLEEP].

13:16.963 --> 13:18.298
Do I have food in my mouth?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.098
Oh.

13:19.098 --> 13:19.899
Yeah.

13:19.899 --> 13:20.833
Bring it.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.335
Oh, no.
I don't know about that, baby.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.269
OK.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.070
Kiss.

13:27.974 --> 13:28.775
Whoa!

13:31.411 --> 13:32.245
Nasty.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.046
Yum.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.347
I chewed it up for
you like a baby

13:34.347 --> 13:35.481
so that you can already eat it.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.483
It's already chewed up.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.751
I feel like I'm
a cow I'm eating

13:38.751 --> 13:41.587
so much salad right here.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.190
I keep looking on
the internet to make

13:44.190 --> 13:46.793
sure that my paparazzi
pictures have made it.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.562
And as I'm looking,
I don't see anything.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.197
Any pictures?

13:51.197 --> 13:53.566
Not that I see.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.968
Try and get a shot of
this good looking guy.

13:55.968 --> 13:56.969
Oh, boy [INAUDIBLE].

13:59.038 --> 14:01.507
I don't see any pictures.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.308
Seriously?

14:02.308 --> 14:03.710
Out of the six paparazzi?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.011
Especially at they Ivy?

14:05.011 --> 14:05.812
Come on.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.114
I know there was so
many paparazzi there.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.515
At least one of
them should have--

14:09.515 --> 14:10.717
Oh, my gosh.
Babe, look.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.119
We absolutely adore
Kim Kardashian's

14:13.119 --> 14:17.290
new minimalist sense of
style at the Ivy restaurant

14:17.290 --> 14:20.760
in Hollywood, aka the place to
dine if you want to be seen.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.561
OK.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.895
Well now I know
why the paparazzi

14:22.895 --> 14:26.032
didn't post any of my pictures,
because Kim was there.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.467
If she wasn't there,
then maybe I would have

14:27.467 --> 14:29.736
gotten some paparazzi pictures.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.871
But if maybe she wasn't
there, then maybe the paparazzi

14:31.871 --> 14:32.672
wouldn't be there.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.273
You got to look at
it that way, too.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.074
That's true.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.376
There's always a
next time, babe.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.610
You can't give up.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.745
We can't give up.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.380
Seriously.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.782
I had all this paparazzi jocking
me and none of these pictures

14:42.782 --> 14:43.683
are showing online.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.485
I want this party to be awesome.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.853
And I want to get
my face out there.

14:46.853 --> 14:50.423
So I got to figure out ways
for people to talking about me.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.991
And right now that
just isn't happening.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.477
I love to paint.

15:11.477 --> 15:15.848
My mom was an artist and I've
inherited her artistic gene.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.717
It's just another way
of expressing myself.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.154
And I had decided to paint a
portrait for Brie and Bryan

15:21.154 --> 15:22.822
because I want to
give them something

15:22.822 --> 15:25.024
that they're going to have
for the rest of their lives.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.993
You're still
painting this thing?

15:26.993 --> 15:28.795
I just feel like I need to
add a couple more touches.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.801
For what?

15:34.801 --> 15:37.203
To be honest, I haven't
seen Bryan this groomed

15:37.203 --> 15:38.237
for about two years.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.038
I know.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.140
I'm trying to make it look nice
because it's for their wedding.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.543
It's my gift and
your gift to them.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.211
Maybe they want some
sort of like vegan

15:45.211 --> 15:46.646
blender or something.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.281
Do you not like it?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.149
Do you want me to lie or do
you want my honest opinion?

15:50.149 --> 15:51.250
I'm actually
really proud of it.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.519
If you don't like it,
then you can leave.

15:53.519 --> 15:54.921
Look what Louie did.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.556
He like stepped in
the paint and I think

15:56.556 --> 15:58.825
it actually kind of adds to it.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.359
The whole point of
this is to give them

16:00.359 --> 16:02.495
something that they don't have.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.530
What are you drawing
on Bryan's face?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.531
I'm not done with it.

16:05.531 --> 16:06.899
I'm almost done.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.967
Oh, my god.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.069
I'll leave you
and Louie to this.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.070
I like it Lou.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.038
Do you like it, buddy?

16:22.248 --> 16:25.184
Since my paparazzi plan didn't
work how I would have liked it

16:25.184 --> 16:28.521
to, I'm meeting up with one
of my really good friends

16:28.521 --> 16:31.224
who I know is going to
give me all the attention

16:31.224 --> 16:32.291
and clout that I need.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.033
Nice ride.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.103
I'm so excited for this.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.538
We're going to put
this on top of the car.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.639
There's no other way to fit it.

16:46.639 --> 16:51.010
I can't wait to give Brie
and Bryan their wedding gift.

16:51.010 --> 16:51.811
Uh oh.

16:51.811 --> 16:52.612
NATTIE: Oh, my god, TJ.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.413
The painting is on the road.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.882
I'm going to keep
moving around you.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.116
Babe, can I speak with
you for a moment, please?

16:57.116 --> 16:57.917
What's with this?

16:57.917 --> 16:59.085
What do you mean
what's with that?

16:59.085 --> 17:00.086
All these no more Vinnie.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.454
This is not right.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.231
Nice ride.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.465
I'm so excited for this.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.800
Ray J is one of my friends.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.167
He's like a friend
of the family.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.539
And I know that if we hang
out, paparazzi is definitely

17:19.539 --> 17:20.406
going to grab pictures.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.575
So you're just getting back
to the routine of working out

17:22.575 --> 17:23.976
and everything?
-Yeah.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.545
That's going to get
you in shape right now.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.880
Cardio, yoga.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.316
I want to do different
stretching techniques,

17:30.316 --> 17:32.618
because I know in
yoga you got to be--

17:32.618 --> 17:33.519
Be flexible?

17:33.519 --> 17:34.620
And together, right?

17:34.620 --> 17:36.556
Before we could even
make it into the gym,

17:36.556 --> 17:37.623
there's paparazzi.

17:37.623 --> 17:38.858
They're taking pictures.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.626
They're recording videos.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.028
-After you.
-Thank you.

17:42.028 --> 17:42.828
Please.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.564
I'm just like, yes.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.601
This is working exactly
how I wanted it to.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.603
You got some big guns there.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.939
Take my hat for me?

17:52.939 --> 17:53.739
Thank you, love.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.540
You're welcome.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.045
Nice little warm up.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.380
Can you do a push up
with me sitting on you?

18:01.380 --> 18:03.616
Oh. [BLEEP]!

18:03.616 --> 18:05.051
Let me see you do a pullup.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.252
I'll help you.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.354
One.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.455
Wait, wait.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.723
Hold on.
Let me try.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.824
OK.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.392
You're doing a pull
up and a sit up.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.194
You want me to teach you
how to wrestle a little bit?

18:15.194 --> 18:15.995
Yeah.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.697
One, two, three.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.165
[LAUGHING]

18:19.165 --> 18:20.399
I don't want to hurt you.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.767
You're a woman.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.635
OK, ready.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.436
One, two, three.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.141
Oh, OK.

18:29.141 --> 18:33.079
[BLEEP] Let's do the MMA.

18:33.079 --> 18:33.980
MMA?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.348
You know, I'm made
for this [BLEEP].

18:35.348 --> 18:36.148
How you doing?

18:36.148 --> 18:36.949
Good.

18:36.949 --> 18:37.950
How are you?

18:37.950 --> 18:38.851
I scratched you.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.286
Dude, you got a pump already.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.587
You starting without me?

18:41.587 --> 18:42.388
I'm hanging in there.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.756
I've been kicking
his ass right now.

18:43.756 --> 18:44.490
All right.
Shoes off.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.526
We're going to do a little
submission ground wrestling.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.528
You go ahead and
get on your knees,

18:49.528 --> 18:50.696
wrap your legs around him.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.797
Oh.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.699
This hand is going to
come down and you're going

18:53.699 --> 18:54.900
to throw your arm over him.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.102
Yeah.
Like that.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.069
Break his arm.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.671
Choke him out.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.872
[BLEEP] OK.
I feel you.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.840
Drive with your hips.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.641
Like this?

19:01.641 --> 19:02.608
Sit on his chest.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.911
You just reversed the fight,
totally dominating position.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.947
I could go like this, too.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.016
If he's into that
kind of stuff.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.251
The closer I get to Ray
J, the more paparazzi

19:12.251 --> 19:13.052
is going to catch that.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.287
Because you know the
media likes anything

19:15.287 --> 19:16.789
that's a little bit spicy.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.991
So I figure, you know what,
hey, why not give it to them.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.792
Whew!

19:19.792 --> 19:20.726
Thank you again.

19:20.726 --> 19:21.527
Have a good weekend.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.328
That was very real.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.397
Oh, now you go take a shower.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.931
What's good, y'all?

19:25.931 --> 19:27.233
How was the workout?

19:27.233 --> 19:28.334
Crazy.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.201
It was good.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.936
Pow, home run.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.539
I am going to be over all
the internet tomorrow.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.775
And this is exactly what I need.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.176
And I just can't wait
to see what happens.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.277
-All right, love.
-Bye.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.078
All right.

19:39.078 --> 19:39.879
See you later.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.353
Do you need to fix anything?

19:47.353 --> 19:50.823
Or do you feel like that's good?

19:50.823 --> 19:51.691
Let's try again.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.193
This is a lot of pressure
for us to have this test run.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.530
We could be having a match as
early as tomorrow, next week.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.497
You never really know.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.100
So Eva and I need to be
at the top of our game.

20:03.069 --> 20:03.869
All right.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.371
That was better.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.172
OK.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.007
Let's [INAUDIBLE] clutch.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.775
OK.

20:09.775 --> 20:10.843
Two arms.

20:10.843 --> 20:11.977
I'm not going to
tell you, you're

20:11.977 --> 20:12.978
supposed to be practicing.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.185
Uh huh.

20:19.185 --> 20:22.088
Is there anything
you want to fix?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.623
Uh, what's the next part?

20:24.623 --> 20:26.525
We're in the ring and we're
going over things that we

20:26.525 --> 20:27.727
went over just recently.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.696
And immediately
it's evident to me

20:30.696 --> 20:33.165
that Eva just hasn't practiced.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.000
I'm taking the time
to teach you this

20:35.000 --> 20:38.270
and you can at least
practice for, psh,

20:38.270 --> 20:40.072
15 minutes in your spare time.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.841
I'm annoyed.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.641
What about this one?

20:42.641 --> 20:45.878
You just grab the--
like you said, I mean.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.781
I told you that
the other day, too.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.282
Have you been practicing
with the trainers?

20:50.282 --> 20:51.217
Well, just with everything.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.088
When we've been practicing it's
important for you to remember.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.390
If you're not retaining it, I
feel like I'm wasting my time.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.192
I've been in the
WWE in nine months.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.561
I mean, I'm doing the best
that I can with limited time

21:02.561 --> 21:04.663
that we have being on the
road and doing everything.

21:04.663 --> 21:05.965
Yeah.
I'm on the road, too.

21:05.965 --> 21:06.766
This is RAW.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.566
This is live TV.

21:07.566 --> 21:11.003
Any opportunity that they give
us, we can't take for granted.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.371
I don't want you to
think I'm nitpicking.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.806
It just has to be good.

21:13.806 --> 21:14.640
It's live.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.574
This is live TV.

21:15.574 --> 21:16.509
There's no do-overs.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.478
I'm here trying and,
like, you know my schedule.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.313
You know how
[BLEEP] crazy it is.

21:21.313 --> 21:22.314
You know how I'm stressed out.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.716
I have just as busy
a schedule as you do.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.152
Like, if not busier.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.921
Being in a tag team, we have
to get some moves together

21:28.921 --> 21:32.057
and she needs to retain
it so we don't flop.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.293
If she doesn't do
well, then that's

21:34.293 --> 21:35.528
a direct reflection of me.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.072
Hold on, TJ.

21:47.072 --> 21:47.873
Hi.

21:47.873 --> 21:48.741
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.976
I have something that
was in a big box.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.547
Oh, sorry.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.581
Yeah, this is it.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.116
Since I want no
part of the painting,

21:57.116 --> 21:57.917
I'll take your big bag.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.018
No, I'll take your backpack.

21:59.018 --> 21:59.819
No.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.853
-Take my purse.
-No.

22:00.853 --> 22:01.654
No.

22:04.723 --> 22:05.591
You got it.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.227
I can't wait to give Brie
and Bryan their wedding gift.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.995
I feel like the best
way to get it to them

22:09.995 --> 22:13.399
and to show it off is
to bring it in person.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.733
I'm surprised you
got through there.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.402
[BLEEP]

22:16.402 --> 22:18.470
Back in and just have them ship
it to Brie and Bryan's house.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.905
No, TJ, I want to give
it to them in person.

22:19.905 --> 22:21.307
I don't want it landing
on their doorstep.

22:21.307 --> 22:22.741
I don't want someone
running off with it.

22:22.741 --> 22:25.077
I worked hard on it, and I'm
going to make sure they get it.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.622
Miss Yoga.

22:36.622 --> 22:37.723
Oh, wow.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.726
Tonight is our big
match and I'm so excited.

22:40.726 --> 22:44.830
But I've had literally a handful
of matches and I'm so nervous.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.632
Hold up.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.034
These short is
not working, girl.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.903
Miss Lucy is like
all over the place.

22:50.903 --> 22:51.804
I can't have that.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.605
Oh, my god.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.906
Please, just take it off.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.942
And I think it's too much
booty out in the back.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.210
I don't think it is.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.647
When you bend over,
[INAUDIBLE] you going to take

23:01.647 --> 23:04.149
somebodies picture.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.718
There you go.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.720
No, it looks cute.

23:09.588 --> 23:10.723
Oh, my god.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.058
Talk to me like again, this
will be your last outfit.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.827
I promise you.

23:14.827 --> 23:15.694
Oh, my god.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.068
Hold on.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.704
[HORN HONKING]

23:25.704 --> 23:26.705
Nat, are you insane?

23:30.009 --> 23:33.445
I booked a full size, but
when I got to the counter

23:33.445 --> 23:35.814
all they had left
was a compact size.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.216
We're going to put
this on top of the car.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.484
There's no other way to fit it.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.285
We're going to what?

23:39.285 --> 23:41.186
I'm putting the box
on top of the car.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.489
The arena is not more
than five miles away.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.857
We put it on top of the car.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.125
We tie it down.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.093
We have leggings that
I've been wearing

23:48.093 --> 23:50.696
and nylon stockings and tape.

23:50.696 --> 23:51.497
Voila.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.298
We're on our way.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.900
It's not brain surgery.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.201
TJ: Were they out of
other cars or what?

23:56.201 --> 23:58.370
NATTIE: Yes.
Just stop questioning me.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.847
This box is as big
as this whole roof.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.116
People on the street and
in cars are looking at us.

24:11.116 --> 24:11.917
Look at us.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.319
We're idiots.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.354
Look at this contraption.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.922
Athletic wrap.

24:16.922 --> 24:17.723
Pants.

24:17.723 --> 24:18.524
Panty hose.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.459
Stop.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.460
I'll hold on.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.428
Nat.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.429
Relax.

24:23.429 --> 24:24.997
When we're on the
road we make it work.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.866
You improvise and so that's
what I did in this situation.

24:27.866 --> 24:28.801
I feel MacGyver.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.271
TJ:Uh oh.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.672
NATTIE: Oh, my god, TJ.

24:33.672 --> 24:34.606
The painting is on the road!

24:34.606 --> 24:36.608
I just found out
about our match.

24:36.608 --> 24:37.609
The tag match?

24:37.609 --> 24:38.410

33:14.359 --> 33:16.094
So what was that all about?

33:16.094 --> 33:17.229
-With Eva?
-Yeah.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.430
You never tagged
her in the match.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.231
I tried.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.599
She just sucks.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.833
I tried so bad.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.536
I went to Carrano and I was
like, I don't know what to do.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.937
This is so soon.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.105
I don't think we're ready.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.040
And I told him on
the live events

33:29.040 --> 33:30.375
this weekend I was with Tamina.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.844
For me, it's better if
I make it look good.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.846
I know Tamina is going to be
there to make it look good,

33:34.846 --> 33:35.647
too.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.415
To be honest, I couldn't
get past it looking good.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.252
All I was sitting there watching
was you not tagging her in.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.987
I just need her to
retain [INAUDIBLE],

33:41.987 --> 33:43.889
show me that she
has the passion.

33:43.889 --> 33:44.689
I don't know.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.624
I'm just annoyed.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.424
I'm sorry.

33:46.424 --> 33:47.459
I got to go.

33:47.459 --> 33:48.260
We have Fandango.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.464
I have no idea.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.900
Like you don't
even want to tag in?

33:54.900 --> 33:55.901
She wouldn't tag me at all.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.802
I know, but the point of
it is that we're a team.

33:57.802 --> 33:58.770
I know.

33:58.770 --> 34:02.741
So if I'm putting my
hand out, tag my hand.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.676
She would reach in
front of me and literally

34:04.676 --> 34:05.610
tag me every time.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.579
She wouldn't even give me
the opportunity to tag.

34:07.579 --> 34:11.081
I say you need to step
up and take your place.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.551
Do what you're supposed to do.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.052
If that's how much you
want it, then take it.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.455
You can't just sit there and
let somebody step all over you.

34:17.455 --> 34:18.889
She was telling me
that she didn't tag you

34:18.889 --> 34:19.991
in because she thinks you suck.

34:19.991 --> 34:23.495
She said she never just
wanted to tag you by yourself.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.096
That's why she asked
if Tamina would join.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.532
She wants to pitch this whole
gimmick like red and gold.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.199
And then now when we actually
have the opportunity,

34:29.199 --> 34:31.937
she wants to bury the
[BLEEP] out of me.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.581
ANNOUNCER: This is entertaining.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.583
This is fun!

34:44.583 --> 34:45.583
A knee right to the face?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.619
I've never felt so much pain.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.587
You just walk away.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.754
It's a real easy thing to do.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.522
You know what?

34:50.522 --> 34:51.889
You're mad because
you think that I'm

34:51.889 --> 34:53.592
going to like outshine you.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.767
She would reach in
front of me and literally

35:02.767 --> 35:04.169
tag every single time.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.137
Next time, excuse me, bitch.

35:06.137 --> 35:06.905
Slap her.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.340
Even if you tag her
right on the head.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.541
Don't let that happen again.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.577
Summer is just one of those
girls that is just shady

35:12.577 --> 35:16.247
and that clearly tells you
what type of person Summer is.

35:16.247 --> 35:17.716
I just was last to find out.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.484
We'll get her next time.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.827
Can I talk to you for a second?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.629
Yeah.

35:30.629 --> 35:35.400
So after our match,
the girls came up to me

35:35.400 --> 35:38.103
and let me in on why you
didn't tag me in and all that.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.705
I don't appreciate you like
running behind my back talking

35:40.705 --> 35:41.506
hella [BLEEP].

35:41.506 --> 35:43.608
I was your only ally, and now
you can go [BLEEP] yourself.

35:43.608 --> 35:44.743
Eva.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.144
Because I'm totally
done with you.

35:46.144 --> 35:46.878
All right.
Fine.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.013
Walk away.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.014
You just walk away.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.583
It's a really easy thing to do.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.517
Are you kidding me?

35:52.517 --> 35:53.318
You know what?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.820
You're mad because you think
that I'm going to outshine you.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.422
I can die my hair red
and look hotter than you.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.057
So don't even pull that.
-Cool.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.659
Good for you.
-Die your hair red.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.559
Please try it.

36:01.559 --> 36:02.661
Let's see what happens.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.163
EVA: Have fun, because
no one likes you, dude.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.032
At this point I'm
so done with Summer.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.667
As far as us having
each other's back.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.434
Yeah, right.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.635
Have fun being by yourself.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.191
CAMERON: Today I have a
photo shoot for a magazine

36:33.191 --> 36:34.159
called "Rolling Out."

36:34.159 --> 36:36.528
And I'm super excited that
I have some of my team

36:36.528 --> 36:37.328
here with me.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.264
I have my manager,
Terrell, my girlfriend,

36:39.264 --> 36:40.432
Elaina, who is doing makeup.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.000
My mom is doing my hair.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.369
I even have booboo
Vinnie here to support me

36:44.369 --> 36:46.438
and it's just awesome.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.806
Go ahead and just
glance up at me.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.443
Eyes right at me.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.243
Beautiful.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.512
This is so amazing right now.

36:54.512 --> 36:55.413
I feel like a princess.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.818
You know what I'm saying?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.686
Catch your eyes right at me.

37:01.686 --> 37:02.487
Awesome.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.723
Lift your head up
just a little bit.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.491
Beautiful.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.993
Give me a grin
that I can believe.

37:08.993 --> 37:09.794
All right.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.229
So I'm going to
have you over here.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.364
I think that your legs would
be more so of my focus.

37:13.364 --> 37:16.000
Babe, can I speak to
you for a moment, please?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.470
It's all good.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.938
OK.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.940
What's with this?

37:21.940 --> 37:23.108
What do you mean
what's with that?

37:23.108 --> 37:25.944
You and Ray J coming
out from the gym.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.679
All this, no more Vinnie.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.980
Babe, wait.

37:28.980 --> 37:29.948
Babe, hold on.
Wait, wait.

37:29.948 --> 37:30.348
Hold on.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.716
All the comments
is just too much.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.084
Look, hon, can we
talk about this later?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.652
Right now I'm just trying
to do the photoshoot.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.355
No, right now my heart is
beating like a thousand miles.

37:37.355 --> 37:38.656
This is not right.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.925
Right now I'm thinking this is
not the time to talk about it.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.128
I honestly feel like you're
taking it too seriously.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.462
We'll talk about this later.

37:44.462 --> 37:45.830
I'm in the middle
of a photoshoot.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.565
We've been down
this route before.

37:47.565 --> 37:51.035
I just don't want to
make a big scene at work.

37:51.035 --> 37:51.576
[SIGH]

38:06.584 --> 38:08.720
Tonight is my
singles release party

38:08.720 --> 38:12.423
for my song called "Bye Bye."

38:12.423 --> 38:14.926
This is an exciting moment,
but at the same time,

38:14.926 --> 38:16.728
I feel really bad for
not telling Vinnie

38:16.728 --> 38:19.164
that I was going to go
see Ray J at the gym.

38:19.164 --> 38:22.033
I know right now Vinnie
is just beyond livid.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.038
So how do you handle
those paparazzi

38:27.038 --> 38:29.507
because we have been seeing
pictures with you and Ray J.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.575
He's just one of my friends.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.177
And, you know, we just
happen to be at the gym.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.511
And, you know, the
thing about the media

38:33.511 --> 38:34.946
is that they'll construe things.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.081
Hanging out with a guy, anybody
is going to be like, oh,

38:37.081 --> 38:38.183
who are you with
and who is that?

38:38.183 --> 38:39.284
Well, you look fantastic.

38:39.284 --> 38:40.752
Congratulations with
all your success.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.553
Thank you.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.087
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you inside.

38:43.087 --> 38:45.023
We're going to get funky.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.959
Holler!

38:47.959 --> 38:48.927
Oh, yes!

38:48.927 --> 38:49.928
Yes.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.896
Oh, I'm so happy you came.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.399
I'm happy that I have my
girl Eva here to support me

38:54.399 --> 38:55.466
and be here at my party.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.168
I feel like we've
come such a far way

38:57.168 --> 38:58.803
since the whole photo incident.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.673
And I'm glad she's able to
share this moment with me.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.908
It's been a long
few months for us.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.743
I just want to say, out
of all the girls tonight,

39:05.743 --> 39:06.811
you were the one that showed up.

39:06.811 --> 39:08.046
And that means so much to me.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.648
And I just want to say thank
you girls so much for being here

39:10.648 --> 39:11.649
because it means a lot.

39:11.649 --> 39:12.984
Seriously, I'm so proud of you.

39:12.984 --> 39:13.952
Like, this is so dope.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.287
I'm so happy that I can be
here and share it with you.

39:16.287 --> 39:19.691
When I first came into the
WWE the other girls and me

39:19.691 --> 39:21.793
were going at each other's
throats a little bit.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.495
And now throughout this
whole summer drama,

39:24.495 --> 39:26.631
every one of these
girls has my back.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.132
It's like a bittersweet moment.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.802
I'm so happy I'm here,
but at the same time--

39:30.802 --> 39:32.203
Where's little Vinners?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.405
He's really mad because
he found the pictures

39:34.405 --> 39:36.841
with Ray J and I at the gym.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.042
So, I mean, I'm
enjoying tonight,

39:38.042 --> 39:38.943
but it's kind of like--

39:38.943 --> 39:39.944
It's not the same.

39:39.944 --> 39:40.745
It's not the same.

39:40.745 --> 39:41.613
His feelings are hurt.

39:41.613 --> 39:42.447
And I get it.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.515
If he were to do that
and roll to the gym

39:44.515 --> 39:48.052
with some other little honey,
you would be like, oh no, boo.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.153
That's not working out.

39:49.153 --> 39:52.223
Now that I look back at
it, I'm like, I [BLEEP] up.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.159
But then it sucks
sometimes because you're

39:55.159 --> 39:56.961
too late to say sorry.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.363
He wasn't trying to hear it.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.798
I didn't really share the
information with Vinnie.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.268
And now I just feel so bad.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.403
I just want to go ahead
and make amends so we

40:05.403 --> 40:07.272
can put this all behind us.

40:07.272 --> 40:10.174
Honestly, I was just telling
Eva it's a bittersweet moment

40:10.174 --> 40:12.944
because I'm happy that I'm
having this amazing moment,

40:12.944 --> 40:15.179
but it's kind of
like I feel bad.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.181
I just want to apologize
for the whole photos.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.683
I was only thinking
about myself and I wasn't

40:18.683 --> 40:20.218
thinking about your feelings.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.986
We all make mistakes
and I just hope

40:21.986 --> 40:23.521
you can forgive me for that.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.524
Baby, you know I
want the best for you.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.592
Thank you for apologizing.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.393
It means a lot to me.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.028
And plus, baby--

40:31.896 --> 40:32.830
Aw.

40:32.830 --> 40:33.765
You're my heart, you know?

40:33.765 --> 40:37.135
Building my brand and making
a name for myself is important

40:37.135 --> 40:40.571
but none of this means anything
if I don't have the person who

40:40.571 --> 40:42.407
I care for right by my side.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.842
I'm so happy and
grateful for you

40:44.842 --> 40:47.312
guys all coming out tonight.

40:47.312 --> 40:50.214
And a bitch is about to work!

40:50.214 --> 40:52.684
[MUSIC PLAYING]

40:59.223 --> 41:00.591
Girl, bye.

41:00.591 --> 41:01.926
Oh, damn!
Girl bye.

41:01.926 --> 41:02.927
Oh, my gosh.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.595
I actually want to
take this home with me.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.080
ANNOUNCER: Welcome
to Monday Night RAW.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.514
Their song always
stays on my head.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.315
Mine too.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.484
The funk is [INAUDIBLE].

41:26.484 --> 41:28.953
Of course Summer
is right next to me.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.021
Even thought it's
been two years

41:30.021 --> 41:31.756
it still stays in my head.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.524
I can't stand her right now.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.827
But we are at work, so I'm
going to be professional.

41:45.403 --> 41:48.506
ANNOUNCER: Naomi gets set for
one on one action with Aksana.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.476
Tonight I have another big
match on Monday Night RAW.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.277
Wrestlemania is right
around the corner.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.646
And I am well on
my way to becoming

41:55.646 --> 41:57.415
the next Divas champion.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.751
[BELL]

42:00.852 --> 42:02.153
ANNOUNCER: So it's
Naomi versus Aksana.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.989
And, AJ, I can only assume
you're out here to scout

42:04.989 --> 42:07.558
Naomi over the fact
that she has defeated

42:07.558 --> 42:08.426
you twice in recent weeks.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.194
You got to be impressed,
AJ, though with Naomi.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.996
Great athlete.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.966
AJ: I mean, yeah, she looks
like a sexy baked potato.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.601
ANNOUNCER: I've never seen
a baked potato do that.

42:16.601 --> 42:16.966
AJ: Yeah.

42:16.966 --> 42:17.802
If you leave it in
the oven long enough.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.404
ANNOUNCER: AJ, Naomi
says she's coming

42:19.404 --> 42:22.473
after your Divas championship.

42:22.473 --> 42:23.908
AJ: This is a PG program.

42:23.908 --> 42:24.876
How is that acceptable?

42:24.876 --> 42:26.477
ANNOUNCER: This is
entertaining, AJ.

42:26.477 --> 42:27.712
This is fun.

42:27.712 --> 42:28.846
It's fun!

42:28.846 --> 42:30.415
Ow, did you see that?

42:30.415 --> 42:31.516
A knee right to the face?

42:31.516 --> 42:33.751
Instantly I felt so much pain.

42:33.751 --> 42:38.322
She comes down with her
knee and I hear a crack.

42:38.322 --> 42:40.291
I feel my eye go
back into my socket.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.326
And all I know is
I've never felt pain

42:42.326 --> 42:43.594
like this before in my life.

42:43.594 --> 42:44.829
ANNOUNCER: Oh, look at that.

42:44.829 --> 42:46.330
Split [INAUDIBLE] by Naomi.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.968
[BELL]

42:50.968 --> 42:52.470
She looks like
she's really hurt.

43:10.988 --> 43:14.625
NARRATOR: Next time
on Total Divas.

43:14.625 --> 43:16.494
It's my bachelorette party.

43:16.494 --> 43:17.895
It's Brie-mode time.

43:17.895 --> 43:21.666
The best situation for me is
to not be around alcohol at all.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.134
And everything is
so overwhelming.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.368
Yes!
Yes!

43:24.368 --> 43:25.169
Yes!

43:25.169 --> 43:26.537
Yes!

43:26.537 --> 43:28.473
I was going to be the
next Divas champion.

43:28.473 --> 43:30.408
I've worked so hard to have
a shot at Wrestlemania.

43:30.408 --> 43:31.576
This bone here?

43:31.576 --> 43:33.077
That's broken.

43:33.077 --> 43:34.245
--[INAUDIBLE] ask
you to marry him.

43:34.245 --> 43:35.446
The only wedding
I am going to have

43:35.446 --> 43:36.647
is the one that I
had when I was 20.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.249
What?
You weren't married before.

43:38.249 --> 43:39.350
I was.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.319
Are you joking?

43:42.305 --> 43:48.794
