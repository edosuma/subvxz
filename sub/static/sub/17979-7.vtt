01:18.517 --> 01:20.634
And we're here on the set of "Lez Girls"

01:20.635 --> 01:22.132
where director Jennifer Schecter

01:22.172 --> 01:24.025
is filming her groundbreaking new movie

01:24.068 --> 01:26.298
about a close-knit group
of lesbian friends

01:26.333 --> 01:27.986
living in Los Angeles.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.195
Let's take a look.

01:36.070 --> 01:37.261
And

01:39.044 --> 01:40.405
action.

01:41.548 --> 01:44.131
I hope I didn't upset you too much
the other night.

01:44.165 --> 01:46.000
Oh, no.

01:46.722 --> 01:48.136
It's just...

01:49.841 --> 01:51.683
Oh fuck! Line?

01:53.560 --> 01:56.326
I... no, I... it's just, you know,

01:56.369 --> 01:57.992
- I thought I should tell you...
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58.038 --> 01:59.240
Thank you. I got it.

02:00.075 --> 02:02.210
And action...

02:04.098 --> 02:06.920
I know, it's...

02:06.957 --> 02:10.493
It's just that I thought
I should tell you that, you know, um...

02:10.525 --> 02:14.591
- Well, I'm not a...
- ...a bi-coffee drinker?

02:16.225 --> 02:17.843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:17.865 --> 02:19.992
- Jenny, I can't work like this.
- It's funny!

02:20.028 --> 02:21.990
- Funny?
- Oh, my... Screw you, Begonia!

02:22.076 --> 02:24.992
You know, I'm so sick of you
ragging on me all the time.

02:24.995 --> 02:26.753
You know, how am I supposed to act
with her

02:26.797 --> 02:28.570
- hating me across the table?
- You know what?

02:28.618 --> 02:30.202
It's called acting.
Why don't you try it?

02:30.248 --> 02:32.063
Oh, it's called acting with an asshole!

02:32.098 --> 02:33.663
Why don't you come back another time?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.643
We'll just get another scene. Okay?

02:35.678 --> 02:37.720
- So, cut.
- Yeah, that's okay.

02:38.647 --> 02:39.680
What?

02:40.286 --> 02:42.761
Who the fuck is..
Who the fuck are you?

02:42.795 --> 02:44.303
It's EPK.

02:44.345 --> 02:46.220
What the fuck is EPK?

02:46.256 --> 02:48.721
- It's the...
- ...the Electronic Press Kit.

02:48.755 --> 02:50.470
What? What does that mean?

02:50.506 --> 02:53.031
- So the studio hires...
- Is this a spy?

02:53.066 --> 02:55.383
someone to do behind...
No, behind means footage for the...

02:55.415 --> 02:57.381
- DVDs. Yeah.
- The extras.

02:57.418 --> 02:58.910
- They're gonna put this on the DVD?
- No.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.961
- I think they'll wait to another scene.
- But the DVD hasn't been released yet.

03:01.997 --> 03:03.890
Okay, you get the fuck off my set.

04:04.726 --> 04:07.362
Hey, check it out.
Come in at the wrestling.

04:07.396 --> 04:09.130
It's gonna be such an awesome night.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.903
- I hope you'll make it.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:10.937 --> 04:14.121
Jenny and I have spoken to Begonia.
The situation is contained.

04:14.156 --> 04:17.303
For now. But I really want
Niki to stay focused, all right?

04:17.336 --> 04:19.833
I want zero distractions.
What is that?

04:19.878 --> 04:23.312
"Lesbian Turkish Oil Wrestling
at SheBar Tonight"?

04:23.358 --> 04:25.653
Oh my God! There is no way
I'm gonna let

04:25.685 --> 04:29.141
Dawn Denbo and her lover Cindi
recruit customers from our set. Okay?

04:29.178 --> 04:31.341
- Confiscate these, Adele.
- Got it.

04:31.385 --> 04:34.501
And don't let Niki see those.
Zero distractions.

04:34.527 --> 04:35.833
- Zero.
- Absolutely.

04:38.796 --> 04:42.251
Hi. Yeah, sorry. You can't,
you can't pass them out here. Sorry.

04:42.296 --> 04:44.281
Hey, Jenny, we're gonna need you in 5.

04:44.328 --> 04:46.503
- Okay, thanks.
- Right.

04:46.548 --> 04:49.623
You know, Begonia is such a CUNT.

04:49.658 --> 04:52.640
That's very good,
you know how to spell cunt.

04:54.575 --> 04:56.860
Well, that is exactly what she is.

04:57.395 --> 05:00.591
Listen, I need you
to do me a really big favor.

05:00.628 --> 05:04.452
I need you to start being nice to her
on set because

05:04.496 --> 05:07.661
it's hurting her feelings and
that doesn't make the scene better, okay?

05:09.598 --> 05:11.102
Please.

05:11.148 --> 05:14.072
- Please...
- Okay, fine. But...

05:14.118 --> 05:16.723
it's only because I'm doing it for you.
And that is the only

05:16.756 --> 05:18.362
- reason why.
- Okay.

05:18.406 --> 05:19.751
Thank you.

05:21.866 --> 05:23.321
I'll see you later.

05:23.367 --> 05:25.740
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

05:32.795 --> 05:34.013
- Hey!
- What?

05:34.055 --> 05:37.313
- Would you come and visit me later?
- No! I have to go talk to Sam.

05:37.348 --> 05:40.991
- And be serious.
- I'll make it worth you a while.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.291
Go away!

06:02.006 --> 06:03.940
Welcome to California, Colonel Davis.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.411
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Colonel Smythe.

06:06.447 --> 06:08.691
- Can I give you a hand there?
- Oh, please, Jon.

06:09.408 --> 06:10.740
Same old Jill.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.981
How's Joan?

06:12.028 --> 06:14.732
Good. Playing golf
and enjoying the emptiness.

06:14.776 --> 06:17.802
- How's your golfing these days?
- It's gone to hell.

06:17.846 --> 06:21.313
Too much work. But I still enjoy
a good scotch in the officer's club.

06:21.385 --> 06:22.641
I think Bowmore, right?

06:22.676 --> 06:24.480
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh, Beech!

06:27.057 --> 06:28.561
- Sir?
- Captain Beech,

06:28.595 --> 06:30.943
I'd like you to meet
Colonel Gillian Davis.

06:30.987 --> 06:33.943
- Ma'am.
- She's an estimed collegue and a good friend.

06:33.975 --> 06:36.893
- Nice to meet you, Captain Beech.
- Pleasure's mine, Ma'am.

06:36.928 --> 06:40.551
Colonel Davis is with us on temporary assignment
from the National Guard Bureau.

06:40.588 --> 06:42.400
She'll be doing back field
on our cases

06:42.446 --> 06:43.972
as the prosecuting attorney.

06:44.777 --> 06:47.363
Captain Beech is
on our defense counsel staff.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.472
You'll be opposing counsel at times.

06:49.506 --> 06:52.051
- So you're the ennemy.
- I certainly hope not, Ma'am.

06:52.087 --> 06:53.700
We all serve the same country.

06:54.527 --> 06:57.501
Well, there's no need to start sweatin'.
I haven't gone over the caseload yet.

06:57.537 --> 06:59.970
- I hope to give you a run for your money, Colonel.
- Oh, that's good.

07:00.005 --> 07:02.273
I enjoy a man with confidence.

07:02.317 --> 07:05.753
It makes all that much more enjoyable
when I crush him.

07:15.045 --> 07:18.131
We are fucked, Williams.
Pardon my french.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.981
Why? What happened?

07:20.028 --> 07:23.140
Gillian Davis is assigned here
on detail for back field.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.150
- She's prosecuting our case.
- Who's Colonel Gillian Davis?

07:26.155 --> 07:28.803
She's military life, hard ass by the book

07:28.906 --> 07:30.810
and the winningest prosecutor
in the field. 

07:30.858 --> 07:32.543
Remember that hazing incident

07:32.577 --> 07:35.010
- blew up in West Point in 03?
- Yeah.

07:35.047 --> 07:36.250
Come read this.

07:36.738 --> 07:39.841
The plebs who sexually assaulted
some female cadets.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.340
That's right. They were following orders
from first classman,

07:42.388 --> 07:44.090
the women all filed charge.

07:44.598 --> 07:48.071
And Colonel Gillian Davis was
brought in as chief prosecuting attorney.

07:48.106 --> 07:50.340
She broke all the defendants down,

07:50.376 --> 07:52.500
all the boys were dismissed
from the academy

07:52.538 --> 07:55.202
and West Point officially
banned hazing as a practice.

07:55.245 --> 07:57.960
I admire what she did.
She sounds highly principled.

07:57.996 --> 08:00.412
Read that quote, right there.

08:00.988 --> 08:03.513
"What's most important here is that

08:03.547 --> 08:07.853
"these men were in direct violation
of the uniform code of military justice.

08:07.885 --> 08:09.800
"They violated the honor code.

08:09.848 --> 08:13.221
"Maintaining these codes is paramount
to keeping the military strong

08:13.256 --> 08:15.951
"and ultimately keeping our nation secured".

08:16.416 --> 08:21.102
That is practically verbatim
the military stand on homosexual conduct.

08:24.015 --> 08:25.961
I'm gonna go for a cup of coffee.

08:36.086 --> 08:38.809
So call in and let us know
what you think

08:38.846 --> 08:41.140
of our special host, Alice Pieszecki,

08:41.195 --> 08:44.020
who is here with us today
direct from her ultra-hip

08:44.066 --> 08:46.880
and controversial website,
MyChart.

08:46.915 --> 08:49.591
OurChart, yeah.
It's, it's

08:49.678 --> 08:51.402
- a social networking site for lesbians...
- And viewers remember,

08:51.506 --> 08:54.620
it is up to you to help us decide
who will replace Kelly.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.740
So, at the end of the show,
we'll give you the number to call

08:56.775 --> 08:59.152
and you can call in,
and cast your vote for Alice.

08:59.195 --> 09:00.780
- Yes!
- Frankly, I think the internet

09:00.825 --> 09:03.920
is mostly used for cowards,
to voice opinions without proof,

09:03.957 --> 09:06.450
- A lot of people say that.
- ...facts or consequences.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.182
Well, I think the internet
is a great source for news.

09:10.215 --> 09:13.531
By news, do you mean
Paris Hilton's sex days?

09:13.577 --> 09:15.132
- Well...
- You have to admit, Alice,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.991
with the hard news,
real reporters show their faces

09:18.035 --> 09:20.151
- and say their names.
- Now they do.

09:20.198 --> 09:22.301
- Well...
- Well, take wikipedia.

09:22.338 --> 09:23.970
<i>Masquerade is the reference site.</i>

09:24.022 --> 09:26.406
<i>But anybody can add
any information they want to it.</i>

09:26.441 --> 09:28.943
<i>- No, no.
- Yes. No fat checking. No truth.</i>

09:28.980 --> 09:32.066
<i>But, does anybody really believe
what they hear on Fox News?</i>

09:32.099 --> 09:33.880
I hate Mary Lamm!

09:33.925 --> 09:36.033
Why is she giving Alice such a hard time?

09:36.078 --> 09:38.862
I cannot believe
Phyllis roped me into this.

09:38.896 --> 09:42.541
Like I don't have enough to do without
spending the day with Molly, babysitting.

09:42.578 --> 09:46.012
Showing her that lesbians can be
respectable, stable, accomplished people,

09:46.047 --> 09:48.101
or whatever the hell it is
I'm supposed to be doing.

09:48.147 --> 09:49.210
Where you're going?

09:49.257 --> 09:51.643
I thought I would take her
to some galleries and

09:51.676 --> 09:53.932
maybe go by the "Lez Girls" set later.

09:54.497 --> 09:57.280
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah. I've got nothin' but time

09:57.287 --> 09:59.543
since the Planet was closed this week.
So...

09:59.585 --> 10:01.051
Are you going?

10:01.088 --> 10:04.250
No, I'm having lunch with Amy.

10:04.288 --> 10:06.652
- Your ex?
- It's just a friend.

10:09.046 --> 10:10.781
Ready to go to some galleries?

10:10.785 --> 10:14.041
Yeah, I don't really
understand modern art.

10:16.088 --> 10:19.100
- This is my sister Kit. This is Molly.
- Hi.

10:19.136 --> 10:20.170
Hi.

10:21.005 --> 10:23.070
I'm so glad that
Kelly Corrigan left that show.

10:23.116 --> 10:24.831
She was obnoxious.

10:24.876 --> 10:27.543
Alice is a friend of ours.

10:27.578 --> 10:28.882
And your mother too.

10:29.565 --> 10:32.181
<i>All you have to do is log on
snoop.com.</i>

10:32.215 --> 10:35.063
<i>I mean, it's a great source for
misinformation and urban legends, but</i>

10:35.105 --> 10:37.011
<i>- it's easy.
- See, but that's my point.</i>

10:37.045 --> 10:38.830
That's where I know her from.

10:38.865 --> 10:41.073
My mother's degrading podcast.

10:57.137 --> 10:58.703
May I help you with that, Colonel?

10:58.738 --> 11:00.691
No, thank you, Captain.

11:01.866 --> 11:04.700
But if you wouldn't mind
grabbing that case...

11:04.748 --> 11:06.312
Yeah, of course.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.932
You can just put that over there.

11:14.545 --> 11:15.822
Thank you.

11:15.856 --> 11:18.590
- Gillian Davis.
- Tasha Williams.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.340
I see you've been in combat, Williams.

11:21.707 --> 11:23.630
Afghanistan or Iraq?

11:23.665 --> 11:26.301
Iraq, M'am, 18 months.

11:26.347 --> 11:29.571
We have a lot of women
over there on the front lines.

11:30.066 --> 11:32.373
Must have seen your share
of bullets fly.

11:32.415 --> 11:35.981
Yeah, my company was engaged
in the direct line of fire, quite a few times.

11:36.015 --> 11:39.100
The closest I have ever been
to direct fire was in

11:39.138 --> 11:40.731
Panama, 89.

11:41.225 --> 11:43.843
Lawyers don't exactly get to see
a lot of action.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.702
Will you do another tour?

11:48.328 --> 11:50.813
My company is deployed in Iraq
right now.

11:52.528 --> 11:55.321
- I've been held back.
- Were you injured?

11:55.807 --> 11:56.923
No, Ma'am.

11:59.647 --> 12:01.790
I'm being reviewed for separation.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.290
On what violation?

12:07.326 --> 12:09.072
Chapter 15.

12:10.526 --> 12:12.921
I believe
you'll be prosecuting my case.

12:12.956 --> 12:15.701
This is completely a bridge of protocol,
Williams.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.001
You know we aren't supposed
to be engaged

12:17.046 --> 12:18.880
in any conversation until the hearing.

12:18.916 --> 12:21.010
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I was just trying to give you a hand.

12:21.056 --> 12:22.771
You are dismissed, Captain.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.612
Well, it looks like
we've got our topic of the day,

12:33.648 --> 12:37.143
the internet, do we believe it?
Stay tuned. We'll be right back.

12:44.795 --> 12:46.491
Hey, Alice, so...

12:46.525 --> 12:48.541
you don't have and feel Kelly's shoes.

12:48.576 --> 12:50.261
We're not necessarily
looking for controversy.

12:50.287 --> 12:52.032
Was I too controversial?
'Cause I thought I was...

12:52.066 --> 12:55.561
No, no, we just don't need
another Luce Can and now your lifestyle,

12:55.606 --> 12:57.573
it's your lifestyle, and that's all.

12:57.618 --> 12:59.433
Are you saying you don't want me
to be out? Just because

12:59.478 --> 13:02.090
I think that at this stage of my life,
it's a little hard to...

13:02.126 --> 13:04.840
- Oh, no, no, that's not what we're saying.
- No, we definitively want gay.

13:04.878 --> 13:06.813
- No, gay is good.
- Gay is good.

13:06.846 --> 13:09.811
- Gay is rising a day time!
- You know, we just want the right kind of gay.

13:09.847 --> 13:12.113
Yeah, like fun gay!

13:12.205 --> 13:13.691
- Not angry gay.
- Fun gay?

13:13.726 --> 13:16.371
Yeah, gossip, gay lifestyle,
you know, fun!

13:16.418 --> 13:18.953
We loved that Daryl Brewer shoot
that you pulled,

13:18.995 --> 13:22.103
seriously, that was some of your best work.
We're looking for things like that.

13:22.147 --> 13:25.491
Little inside or tib-hits about
famous people who're in the closet.

13:25.527 --> 13:28.800
We kinda figured you would have
one of those on every episode.

13:28.846 --> 13:30.731
Oh, so you want me to out people?

13:31.536 --> 13:33.982
- On every episode?
- That would be sensational.

13:34.016 --> 13:34.920
That is

13:34.975 --> 13:36.731
- only if you want the job.
- Here we go!

13:36.776 --> 13:38.512
And we're back in 5,

13:38.556 --> 13:39.293
4,

13:39.337 --> 13:40.350
3,

13:40.385 --> 13:41.271
2...

13:41.305 --> 13:44.301
Welcome back to "The Look"
for the viewers.

13:44.337 --> 13:47.411
If you're just joining us,
our topic today is the internet.

13:47.457 --> 13:49.550
Is it a great source of news or

13:49.588 --> 13:52.261
is it a trendy source
of speculation and gossip.

13:52.346 --> 13:55.062
Yeah, but I think what you're missing
is the internet gave people,

13:55.095 --> 13:58.412
you know, the chance to go out
and seek different sources of information.

13:58.455 --> 14:02.522
Well, isn't that what that chart does, Alice?
It offers an alternative point of view.

14:02.566 --> 14:05.510
Yes, it does do that. That is
one of the things that OurChart does,

14:05.558 --> 14:07.522
- among other things.
- So, for example,

14:07.558 --> 14:10.810
the personal details of
celebrity's sex life

14:10.856 --> 14:13.410
would be part of that
alternative point of view, I assume.

14:13.445 --> 14:16.151
Well, yeah, the internet is, is

14:16.206 --> 14:19.450
knowing for revealing
people's hidden sexual identities. Yeah.

14:19.488 --> 14:21.390
- What have you got?
- Tell us.

14:22.346 --> 14:26.320
Yeah, that's something
I would love to bring to "The Look".

14:29.257 --> 14:31.190
I would love to do that.

14:32.425 --> 14:34.011
- Oh come on, give us some!
- Yeah, come on!

14:34.046 --> 14:36.692
Dish, dish, dish...!

14:40.216 --> 14:42.212
Now is a good time?

14:43.915 --> 14:45.611
What do I have for you...

14:48.995 --> 14:51.001
- Do tell.
- I know what you're looking for.

14:51.005 --> 14:53.780
Okay, which Hollywood

14:53.818 --> 14:57.672
little Maxim-endorsed gorgeous
little starlet

14:57.716 --> 14:59.780
is a little bit closer to her

14:59.818 --> 15:02.002
role as a sapphic sister

15:02.046 --> 15:05.550
Hollywood's
new girl-on-girl smoochfest?

15:07.508 --> 15:09.933
- It's all I'm gonna say.
- It's time to stop now.

15:09.965 --> 15:12.731
- So maybe you'll tell us next time.
- I'm gonna tease you.

15:12.775 --> 15:14.393
You are bad!

15:14.427 --> 15:17.381
I am gonna tease you.
Thank you.

15:19.467 --> 15:22.293
- See?
- Fun gay!

15:22.335 --> 15:23.732
Fun gay!

15:28.056 --> 15:29.763
<b>MUSIK</b>

15:31.457 --> 15:33.231
- Oh my God, hi!
- Hi.

15:34.727 --> 15:35.803
How are you?

15:35.847 --> 15:38.553
Can you just tell them
that we need to talk for a second?

15:38.598 --> 15:39.771
Yeah, yeah.

15:39.817 --> 15:42.511
Everyone, can you guys just go out
for one sec, please?

15:42.555 --> 15:44.930
- Booty call!
- No, we're rehearsing the film.

15:48.086 --> 15:49.890
What were you guys doing in there?

15:49.935 --> 15:51.361
- She was checking you out.
- No, she wasn't

15:51.365 --> 15:53.313
- hot checking me out.
- Yes, yes.

15:53.316 --> 15:55.003
She was...

15:55.048 --> 15:57.272
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

15:59.558 --> 16:01.820
I came in here 'cause

16:03.967 --> 16:06.222
Tina wanted me to come
and talk to you.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.010
- Oh really, she did? She wanted you to do this?
- Yeah.

16:09.046 --> 16:11.022
She actually said

16:11.056 --> 16:14.632
maybe we shouldn't be so obvious on set.

16:14.675 --> 16:16.640
That we should try to be

16:16.675 --> 16:19.862
a little more settled about things. But...

16:19.896 --> 16:23.643
- Is this settled?
- Uh, yeah, that's really, that's really good.

16:23.687 --> 16:26.303
I think this is exactly
what she's talking about.

16:26.857 --> 16:28.360
Guys, I can handle the situation.

16:28.376 --> 16:30.322
There is no reason to freak out.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.411
Are you fucking kidding me?!

16:32.445 --> 16:35.440
I'm managing an actress
who was about to go through the roof,

16:35.478 --> 16:37.901
and she's just got out
on national television!

16:37.945 --> 16:40.851
And who is this Alice Pieszecki?
Do you even know this person?

16:40.885 --> 16:43.311
And who is handling security?

16:43.367 --> 16:46.372
We've completely tighted security, okay?

16:46.418 --> 16:49.621
- That should have been done already.
- Look, I've talked to our legal department,

16:49.628 --> 16:51.130
and I've talked to our publicists.

16:51.137 --> 16:54.343
We agreed to issue a press release
steading that Gretchen Pickles

16:54.375 --> 16:56.911
is the only gay cast member.

16:56.955 --> 16:59.682
The press is not gonna get
anywhere near Niki.

16:59.715 --> 17:02.573
- Okay?
- Good. Because if this gets out,

17:02.617 --> 17:05.421
- I will personally blame you.
- Tina, can I talk to you for a minute?

17:05.464 --> 17:07.290
- Then I will blame you.
- Excuse me you guys.

17:07.335 --> 17:09.101
We're shooting right now.
This is our DP.

17:09.136 --> 17:10.481
- I have to go.
- Nice to meet you.

17:10.528 --> 17:12.542
You see that truck over there?
Help yourself to lunch.

17:12.585 --> 17:13.702
I'll talk to you later.

17:17.214 --> 17:19.212
God! Fucking managers!

17:19.256 --> 17:20.172
What's up?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.423
I need a tech crane
with free access at.

17:23.457 --> 17:24.800
You can't have a crane.

17:24.848 --> 17:26.453
But I need one.

17:27.076 --> 17:29.220
- For how long?
- Three days.

17:29.255 --> 17:31.202
What are you going to give me
if I give you a crane?

17:31.307 --> 17:33.783
My undying love and devotion.

17:47.958 --> 17:51.652
I think Tina's got a thing going on the set!

17:53.307 --> 17:55.551
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, no, no.

17:55.597 --> 17:58.633
Ex. Ex, ex. It's
my daughter's other mother.

17:59.455 --> 18:01.352
- Why don't you come meet them?
- Yeah.

18:01.396 --> 18:03.161
She seems really...

18:04.097 --> 18:06.381
Hi. Kit Porter, Bette Porter,

18:06.427 --> 18:08.713
- and... I'm sorry?
- Molly Krull.

18:09.267 --> 18:13.443
This is Sam Makarejev.
This is our DP. She,

18:13.478 --> 18:15.612
she shot "Miss Otis Regrets".

18:15.656 --> 18:18.232
- Wow, it's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

18:19.136 --> 18:21.612
- Uh, I'll catch you later.
- Okay.

18:21.655 --> 18:23.320
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Sam.

18:25.986 --> 18:27.900
- What?
- I mean, she's flirting with you.

18:27.946 --> 18:29.510
Oh, don't be silly.

18:31.387 --> 18:33.861
Uh, do you guys mind?
I just want to talk to

18:33.895 --> 18:35.860
- Tina about Angie for...
- Preschool?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.791
- The preschool things.
- Oh, no. Go ahead. Come on.

18:38.828 --> 18:42.903
I'll show you around. I'll show you
the set. It's like my own place.

18:42.908 --> 18:44.130
Hey, Molly?

18:44.175 --> 18:45.983
I will catch up with you.

18:46.026 --> 18:48.040
- Don't worry. I'm fine.
- Okay.

20:21.015 --> 20:22.982
Check it out.

20:23.015 --> 20:25.533
Oh my God! This is supposed
to be our bedroom?

20:25.575 --> 20:28.371
No. It's Bev and Nina's bedroom.

20:28.417 --> 20:31.523
It looks like the children's department
at God-knows-where.

20:33.005 --> 20:35.671
Well, it's Jenny's design choices.

20:36.237 --> 20:39.581
There's nothing I could do about it.
I had to let her have her way.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.713
Look at the phone.

20:46.048 --> 20:47.831
At least it's not a waterbed.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.772
Well, I had to fight her on that one.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.240
So,

20:55.287 --> 20:57.892
which side of the bed is Nina's?

21:01.876 --> 21:03.542
I don't know.

21:07.025 --> 21:08.792
Maybe this side...

21:14.445 --> 21:16.183
Yeah, that feels right.

21:16.228 --> 21:19.450
So, maybe this side would be Bev's side.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.062
And...

21:25.096 --> 21:27.333
Do you have any hard rock candy?

21:28.066 --> 21:29.642
No.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.932
But I have some pot.

21:37.236 --> 21:39.600
<i>Hey, anyone you guys knows
where is Tina?</i>

21:39.636 --> 21:41.290
What the hell was that?

21:41.328 --> 21:43.400
Hey Tina,
the girls are asking for you on set.

21:43.475 --> 21:44.642
I'll be right there.

21:51.316 --> 21:54.380
Gotta go.
Gotta put out the fire.

22:04.488 --> 22:06.622
The size of you doesn't scare me.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.943
I'm small and I can outrun you.

22:10.026 --> 22:13.342
Have I told you that I'm the earth mother
of the producer's child?

22:14.056 --> 22:16.361
I've been here like a billion times.
I'm clear.

22:16.397 --> 22:18.013
Please just call Tina Kennard!

22:18.175 --> 22:21.133
- I was told to call Mr. Kornbluth.
- I don't who Mr. Buetooth is.

22:21.178 --> 22:22.591
If I... There she is. Tina!

22:22.607 --> 22:24.890
Would you please tell the incredible Hulk
to let me in?

22:24.927 --> 22:27.623
- Thanks. I got it.
- Yeah, thanks for nothing.

22:27.668 --> 22:30.240
- Security's a little bit too tight here.
- Um, Alice,

22:31.727 --> 22:34.682
- actually, you are banned from the set. I'm sorry.
- What?!

22:34.718 --> 22:37.143
- What did I do?
- You went on national television

22:37.187 --> 22:40.052
and you outed the lead of our movie!

22:40.085 --> 22:42.443
Hold the phone, Tina!
I did not out her!

22:42.487 --> 22:45.241
I did not say her name!
I did not say her name.

22:45.275 --> 22:47.331
- Alice...
- Okay, I just had to, like...

22:47.367 --> 22:49.573
They won't gonna give me the job.
I had to ??? a little.

22:49.605 --> 22:52.363
Her managers are threatening
to pull her from the picture,

22:52.407 --> 22:54.571
- right now. As we speak.
- That's ridiculous.

22:54.616 --> 22:58.242
They're being dramatic.
She's a lezzie, it's a lezzie film!

22:58.287 --> 23:01.133
- What's the big deal?!
- It's because this is a lesbian movie.

23:01.175 --> 23:03.021
What the fuck does that mean?

23:03.126 --> 23:05.822
We want this movie to reach
a large mainstream audience, alright?

23:05.858 --> 23:08.530
And if everyone thinks
the lead of our movie is gay,

23:08.577 --> 23:11.243
then that makes it
a small little niche film.

23:11.277 --> 23:13.642
What the fuck is up
with everybody these days?

23:13.686 --> 23:16.350
Am I like some sort of idiot that
I'm out? I mean,

23:16.388 --> 23:18.610
is it a joke on me?
'Cause I don't get it.

23:21.598 --> 23:23.842
It's okay. Forget it.

23:23.875 --> 23:26.590
- This is crazy.
- Alice?

23:26.626 --> 23:28.832
Look, you can't blog about this, okay?

23:28.868 --> 23:30.831
'Cause this is really gonna hurt the movie.

23:30.866 --> 23:33.602
You're gonna insult me now?
I am your friend, Tina.

23:33.638 --> 23:36.062
- You know, I wouldn't do that to you.
- Look, I'm sorry.

23:36.106 --> 23:38.363
- Let's have a drink later.
- Oh yeah, that sounds fine.

23:38.397 --> 23:40.351
If I didn't have to drive
the fucking Long Beach

23:40.388 --> 23:42.870
to meet with the lawyer
who's trying to ruin Tasha's carreer.

23:42.957 --> 23:45.771
You know, the hypocrisy
is just like...

23:45.807 --> 23:47.823
Oh, it's a little too much for me
these days.

23:49.165 --> 23:51.700
Oh, I have an idea. Why don't you
and Colonel Davis meet

23:51.746 --> 23:53.940
and you guys can talk about
how to keep gays out of the movies

23:53.985 --> 23:56.723
and out of the military!
Ooooh, fun for you.

23:56.757 --> 23:59.311
- Colonel...
- Jesus Christ!

23:59.947 --> 24:00.913
Fuck!

24:04.048 --> 24:06.670
I heard you were having
a wonderful time at your mother's party.

24:07.298 --> 24:08.840
I didn't see you there.

24:08.888 --> 24:11.543
Yeah, I didn't think you would.
I...

24:11.577 --> 24:13.293
I noticed that you were too busy

24:13.296 --> 24:15.803
checking out those 50-year-olds
in their black bras.

24:15.816 --> 24:17.930
Diving into your mother's swimming pool.

24:17.997 --> 24:21.072
Yeah. Don't remind me of
my mother's total degradation, please.

24:21.107 --> 24:23.313
Can you smile at least?

24:23.345 --> 24:25.402
No?

24:25.448 --> 24:27.330
Hey, guys, Tina got us some

24:27.365 --> 24:30.502
chairs on set which I guess
is some honorable and

24:30.577 --> 24:33.173
priviledge thing.
So, we can watch the next scene.

24:34.796 --> 24:36.493
Take it easy, Molly.

24:42.258 --> 24:45.032
- Hey, just don't smile, okay?
- Sorry.

24:46.636 --> 24:48.981
You could have used
a better line on Molly.

24:49.025 --> 24:51.393
Yeah, I'm trying.

24:53.555 --> 24:55.331
- "There She Goes"
by Vixen -

25:18.597 --> 25:20.672
Let's go out tonight.

25:20.705 --> 25:24.163
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

25:24.987 --> 25:28.031
Because we have to work.

25:29.045 --> 25:31.553
I know you're the big bad boss.

25:31.588 --> 25:33.833
- Cut it off!
- No!

25:34.935 --> 25:37.562
- Why?
- Because...

25:38.316 --> 25:39.890
I'm old.

25:40.515 --> 25:43.341
- I have responsabilities.
- I know.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.583
You're such a drag.

26:12.068 --> 26:14.012
??? right there.

26:26.016 --> 26:27.931
You want any kids ever?

26:30.556 --> 26:31.940
I don't know.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.811
You should.

26:34.845 --> 26:36.291
Why?

26:36.338 --> 26:38.970
Because I want lots of kids.

26:39.007 --> 26:41.233
And I wanna have your kids.

26:44.695 --> 26:47.191
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

26:47.238 --> 26:49.441
We're gonna have all a big family
and we could

26:50.036 --> 26:52.272
go somewhere like Ireland.

26:52.318 --> 26:53.522
Get away from here.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.323
Oh wow!
No one ever said that to me before.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.160
Oh really? Yeah, right, you're full of it.

27:03.568 --> 27:06.993
Oh, we can go to Japan.
You would love Japan. It's so cool.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.702
We got to get the fuck out of L.A.
It's a terrible place.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.782
I know. Don't cry.

27:12.817 --> 27:14.200
<i>Who has a 20 on Jenny?</i>

27:15.908 --> 27:17.251
Oh my God!

27:17.838 --> 27:21.592
It's like when you're fucked
and then your mom calls.

27:22.446 --> 27:23.472
Go

27:23.916 --> 27:25.161
away!

27:29.205 --> 27:32.221
Do you think that we have to stop
fucking during lunch?

27:32.306 --> 27:35.112
- No.
- Do you think they may notice?

27:36.515 --> 27:39.141
- I don't care if they notice.
- Why?

27:40.128 --> 27:41.873
Because...

27:47.227 --> 27:48.390
What?

27:49.975 --> 27:51.261
What?

27:51.835 --> 27:53.140
What...?

27:53.186 --> 27:54.872
I love you.

28:01.266 --> 28:03.181
I'm gonna give you a hanky!

28:04.068 --> 28:06.410
- I'm gonna give you a hanky right now!
- No, you don't.

28:06.435 --> 28:07.753
Yes, I am!

28:21.985 --> 28:23.223
Yeah, it's Beech.

28:23.256 --> 28:25.032
Oh, Captain Beech, it's Davis.

28:25.075 --> 28:29.303
Listen, I have a huge case load
in front of me here

28:29.347 --> 28:31.941
and I'm trying to be as efficient
as possible.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.450
I wanna talk to you
about the Williams case.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.610
Well, I'm not sure
what there is to talk about.

28:36.645 --> 28:39.013
I'm intend to proove the alleguations
against my client are false.

28:39.078 --> 28:41.613
<i>Look, that's just no gonna happen.
You've seen her report.</i>

28:41.656 --> 28:43.613
You know what you're up against?

28:44.635 --> 28:46.931
Listen, I want you to take my advice

28:46.977 --> 28:49.221
and settle. Get her out
before it gets ugly.

28:49.717 --> 28:52.662
Honorable discharge, all full benefits.

28:52.707 --> 28:54.552
She's not gonna accept this.

28:54.595 --> 28:56.081
<i>Just take it to her.</i>

28:56.177 --> 28:58.402
It's your duty as her lawyer
and if you're a good one,

28:58.446 --> 29:00.172
you'll advise her to accept.

29:01.095 --> 29:02.572
Would you hold the line, please?

29:06.065 --> 29:09.742
- It's Colonel Davis, and she...
- Will you tell her to fuck off, please?

29:11.748 --> 29:14.673
Colonel, my client respectfully
declines your offer.

29:18.078 --> 29:20.180
Look at this place!
I mean, check it out!

29:20.227 --> 29:22.070
I should open up a business in here
since them

29:22.115 --> 29:25.502
SheBar bitches shut down the Planet, man.

29:25.535 --> 29:27.082
When can you reopen anyway?

29:27.658 --> 29:30.280
In a week.
I still have one more inspection, then

29:30.365 --> 29:33.140
I gotta drop eight Gs
for all that shit.

29:33.175 --> 29:36.923
I'ma get those ho-bags back. I swear to God,
you mark my words.

29:36.967 --> 29:38.363
Them she-bitches.

29:39.548 --> 29:41.293
Hey, Niki.

29:43.238 --> 29:45.451
They're ready for you on set
right now.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.453
Oh, shit!

29:49.218 --> 29:51.010
Hold on. What is that?

29:52.566 --> 29:55.772
"Lesbian Turkish Oil Wrestling"?
Tonight?

29:55.805 --> 29:58.943
Oh my God. We're going. Jenny!
Jenny, wait! Look it! Look at that!

29:58.975 --> 30:00.880
Wasn't she at SheBar
the other night, was she?

30:00.926 --> 30:03.160
Oh my God! Adele?

30:03.786 --> 30:05.490
- She's cute.
- You know, I'm so sorry.

30:05.526 --> 30:07.610
- Damn! What?
- I know. I don't know what happened.

30:07.648 --> 30:10.011
I thought I got rid of them all,
but somebody must have...

30:10.057 --> 30:12.442
- Okay, it's alright, it's alright.
- Sorry.

30:12.487 --> 30:13.910
It's not your fault.

30:13.948 --> 30:15.430
- Thanks for trying.
- Alright.

30:17.765 --> 30:18.962
What happened?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.891
- It's uh... it's Niki.
- What happened?

30:21.926 --> 30:24.552
She's 20. She's like a puppy.
She keeps running off the set.

30:24.586 --> 30:28.012
And it's driving all the other actors crazy
and freaking me insane.

30:28.047 --> 30:30.651
Is Jenny, um... Is Jenny still...?

30:30.687 --> 30:31.972
Oh yeah.

30:32.008 --> 30:35.313
They fuck everyday in her trailer
at lunch.

30:35.347 --> 30:38.811
The all crew knows it and
Adele stands outside as the guard.

30:38.858 --> 30:40.561
I mean, it's insane!

30:41.548 --> 30:43.271
Can you, can you hold on a second?

30:43.315 --> 30:45.910
Actually, I have to,
I have to go.

30:48.888 --> 30:51.502
Okay, call me or I'll call you.

30:59.266 --> 31:01.652
They really respect Tina.

31:04.007 --> 31:05.432
Of course they do.

31:07.518 --> 31:10.530
I have to get back to the office
now. So if you wanna...

31:10.576 --> 31:12.993
I'm fine. I'm gonna
hang on here.

31:13.708 --> 31:16.133
Alright. Well, I'll get Jodi
to come down the set and...

31:16.168 --> 31:18.042
I'm 24 years old.
I don't need a babysitter.

31:18.046 --> 31:19.943
- Yeah, I...
- You what?

31:20.638 --> 31:22.531
...will take her home.

31:23.195 --> 31:24.271
You have fun.

31:25.147 --> 31:28.033
So Sam's gonna be ready in 15.

31:28.078 --> 31:29.963
So let's have Niki and Jenny for wiring.

31:30.006 --> 31:31.622
Oh, I have to go see Niki.
I can tell her.

31:31.665 --> 31:32.930
Great. Thanks, Adele.

31:36.535 --> 31:38.493
Adele, this is so wrong.

31:38.536 --> 31:41.351
Everyone's at SheBar. Absolutely everyone.
And I'm stuck here.

31:41.387 --> 31:42.611
I know.

31:42.655 --> 31:44.433
It must be really hard on you.

31:44.466 --> 31:47.201
- All your friends are out having fun...
- I know, it totally sucks.

31:47.736 --> 31:48.881
You know what?

31:51.078 --> 31:53.682
I think it's so lame that
they work you this hard.

31:53.728 --> 31:56.240
I mean, a lot of movie stars
they just,

31:56.295 --> 31:58.331
I mean, they refuse
to work past 8 at night.

31:58.376 --> 31:59.271
Really?

31:59.888 --> 32:02.380
I mean, it depends on
how much power they have and

32:02.425 --> 32:04.023
how much the production

32:04.066 --> 32:05.823
respects the time, kinda of that.

32:05.855 --> 32:07.260
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

32:07.298 --> 32:09.653
'Cause, I mean, I sit around here
for hours while they're like

32:09.696 --> 32:12.560
lighting or whatever. I mean,
I'm just sitting here on my ass.

32:12.606 --> 32:14.323
I know. It sucks.

32:15.747 --> 32:18.610
Hey, how much time before
you think they need me again?

32:18.656 --> 32:20.540
'Cause SheBar's right down the street.

32:20.566 --> 32:22.402
I could seriously just run over,
say hi to my friends,

32:22.446 --> 32:23.732
and then, I'd come right back.

32:25.577 --> 32:29.082
Well I think I heard them say that they don't
need you for another hour and a half.

32:29.105 --> 32:30.381
Really?

32:30.427 --> 32:31.903
Oh, yes!

32:34.976 --> 32:37.692
Oh my God! Thank you so much, Adele!
I love you.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.430
How was the rest of your day?

34:21.077 --> 34:23.483
Why do people invite you
to visit film sets?

34:23.525 --> 34:25.120
This is like watching paint dry.

34:25.157 --> 34:27.889
Some people think it's fascinating.
But, in reality, it's boring. So...

34:27.927 --> 34:29.953
So what do people do for fun
in this town,

34:29.987 --> 34:32.342
besides sticking with lesbian
art aficinonadas

34:32.375 --> 34:33.621
and pretending it's exciting?

34:33.716 --> 34:36.110
Well, you can stick around a little bit longer
and then I can take you out.

34:36.156 --> 34:37.580
Sure.

34:38.435 --> 34:39.581
What?

34:39.627 --> 34:41.210
My mother told me
all about your little game.

34:41.216 --> 34:43.560
You're like the Fonz or something,
for lesbians.

34:43.596 --> 34:45.810
- Bullshit! The Fonz?
- Uh, yeah.

34:45.844 --> 34:47.110
- Shut up.
- "Happy Days"?

34:47.155 --> 34:49.242
I'm not Fonz, I'm not "Happy Days",
but, uh...

34:52.717 --> 34:54.322
Alright.

34:54.367 --> 34:57.020
I give it to you, you're sassy.
No one's called me that before.

34:57.068 --> 34:58.880
I'm not sassy. I'm bored.

34:58.916 --> 35:01.170
But not bored enough to sleep with you.

35:05.965 --> 35:07.282
Hot stuff...

35:08.096 --> 35:09.993
Just... just keep breathing.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.522
Sandra,

35:13.377 --> 35:15.731
what's going on?
Why is this taking so long?

35:15.778 --> 35:17.551
We're really here waiting for Niki
to step down.

35:17.586 --> 35:19.281
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Niki's not here yet.

35:19.316 --> 35:20.673
Anybody got 20 on Niki?

35:20.717 --> 35:22.151
- Jenny!
- What?

35:22.187 --> 35:23.281
Oh my God! Um...

35:23.327 --> 35:25.922
Niki's disappeared from set.
We can't find her anywhere.

35:25.966 --> 35:27.662
I think I know where she went.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.570
She went
"Lesbian Turkish Oil Wrestling"?

35:31.226 --> 35:33.061
That little bitch!

35:34.258 --> 35:35.680
- "Loaded" by Bran Van 3000 -

35:36.556 --> 35:40.592
Let's get ready to wrestle!

35:43.578 --> 35:48.212
Hey, are you on, hey,
sexy lesbians out there?

35:49.788 --> 35:52.832
Some of you know me as Denbo,
but tonight,

35:52.878 --> 35:55.812
I'm only known as Miami Vice.

35:56.376 --> 35:58.660
I want to welcome you to the first ever

35:58.707 --> 36:02.783
SheBar Turkish oil wrestling tournament
of the stars!

36:06.077 --> 36:08.331
Over here, we have my lover, Cindi.

36:09.538 --> 36:12.823
But tonight, you call here The Viper.

36:14.086 --> 36:16.541
- Hello, ladies.
- A kiss, honey.

36:20.287 --> 36:22.242
Is there anyone out there

36:22.275 --> 36:25.473
brave enough, dare enough,
to take my Cindi on?

36:25.505 --> 36:26.662
I'll go!

36:32.047 --> 36:35.422
Come on up! Come on up!

36:36.068 --> 36:37.753
What's your name, gorgeous?

36:37.798 --> 36:40.291
Tonight, you all can call me Jesse Jailbait!

36:41.357 --> 36:43.642
Well, Jesse Jailbait,

36:43.677 --> 36:46.260
say hello to The Viper.

36:49.497 --> 36:51.412
Go take your clothes off.

36:53.777 --> 36:55.371
Do you recognize the twink?

36:55.446 --> 36:57.941
Yeah, it's the star from
Shane's friend's lesbian movie, right?

36:57.978 --> 36:59.593
Yeah, it sure is.

36:59.627 --> 37:01.150
She's so down!

37:07.548 --> 37:09.252
Yeah, hey, Miki, it's Dawn Denbo.

37:09.288 --> 37:11.060
Yeah, kinda hot tip for you.

37:28.017 --> 37:29.971
Jenny, I need you to go in there

37:30.008 --> 37:32.402
because you're the only one
she's gonna listen to.

37:33.405 --> 37:36.970
Tina, come on. Don't go in there.
You're a traitor if you do.

37:36.987 --> 37:38.603
Niki Stevens is in there rolling around

37:38.637 --> 37:40.670
in a bath of fat oil, okay?

37:40.715 --> 37:43.231
She's costing my production compagny
hundreds of thousands of dollars

37:43.265 --> 37:46.351
every minute she's in there.
Plus, she's under fucking age.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.462
What... the fucking paparazzi?

37:51.498 --> 37:53.713
I am so screwed!

38:22.247 --> 38:24.490
I am so fucked. Excuse me.

38:28.155 --> 38:30.780
Yeah, Los Angeles police department.

38:32.688 --> 38:36.303
Yeah, I wanna report a night club
serving alcohol to minors.

38:46.545 --> 38:48.813
- I like it.
- It's...

38:48.855 --> 38:50.693
I believe the winner is...

38:50.726 --> 38:53.513
- That is fucked up.
- ...Jesse Jailbait!

38:53.548 --> 38:54.763
Thank you very much.

38:54.795 --> 38:57.132
It's not fucked up. That's amazing.

39:01.966 --> 39:04.532
Who's next for J.J.?

39:10.505 --> 39:13.293
You know how much money
you're costing me? Come here!

39:17.235 --> 39:19.422
You wanna come back to set because

39:19.468 --> 39:22.340
we're just shooting right now, so
you might wanna finish up the scene.

39:22.378 --> 39:25.931
No, no, no, come on. Get in here.
It's so much fun. Yeah.

39:25.976 --> 39:28.231
- Come on.
- No, thanks though.

39:28.275 --> 39:30.103
You know what? I think

39:30.137 --> 39:32.023
you're gonna have to come in here
and fight me.

39:32.058 --> 39:33.942
- No.
- Oh, wait a minute,

39:33.985 --> 39:36.581
I think I heard a challenge.

39:36.617 --> 39:38.570
- That's right, you did.
- Go in here.

39:38.635 --> 39:40.050
- What?
- Get her!

39:40.138 --> 39:41.473
- I don't...
- Get her out!

39:42.355 --> 39:44.262
Come on, come on, fight me.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.630
Alright, let's get her in.

39:48.167 --> 39:51.741
- You asked for it.
- Come on beautiful. Step in the ring!

39:56.565 --> 39:59.773
Take it off!

40:02.006 --> 40:03.790
Keep going!

40:03.825 --> 40:05.743
Oh yeah!

40:07.438 --> 40:09.893
That's what I told you about!

40:19.595 --> 40:21.271
Unbelievable!

40:22.697 --> 40:24.492
- "Smack My Bitch Up"
by The Prodigy -

40:25.798 --> 40:27.252
Come on!

40:27.286 --> 40:29.562
Fucking headlock her!

40:32.585 --> 40:34.721
I didn't realize you liked this.

40:34.755 --> 40:36.992
This is awesome!

40:37.036 --> 40:39.403
Oh, you don't think
that's a little bit degrading?

40:39.438 --> 40:41.342
You don't see my mother in there,
do you?

40:41.387 --> 40:44.100
- Keep it going!
- Get her down!

40:46.047 --> 40:48.342
- Come on!
- Hey, Molly, you wanna a drink?

40:48.366 --> 40:49.670
- Yes.
- What?

40:49.766 --> 40:51.381
- Tequila.
- Okay.

40:55.816 --> 40:56.860
Yeah!

40:58.586 --> 41:01.353
Thank you for coming
all the way out here, Alice.

41:03.565 --> 41:04.623
Although I must say

41:04.656 --> 41:07.462
I was expecting you a bit earlier.

41:08.726 --> 41:10.791
Well, I came as soon as I could.

41:10.828 --> 41:12.113
I do have a life.

41:12.148 --> 41:13.571
Oh yes,

41:13.616 --> 41:15.711
a life that you live pretty loudly.

41:16.317 --> 41:18.361
That's me. Out and proud.

41:20.088 --> 41:22.581
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

41:22.627 --> 41:26.003
Well, I am the recorder in
the Captain Tasha Williams' hearing

41:26.048 --> 41:28.342
and I have a few questions
to ask you.

41:28.387 --> 41:30.773
Well, Tasha and I are just friends,

41:30.818 --> 41:33.791
acquaintances really. I don't,
I don't know her that well.

41:33.828 --> 41:35.331
We know all about your relationship
with Tasha.

41:35.378 --> 41:38.322
We have witnesses that will testify
that they've ssen you together.

41:38.397 --> 41:42.042
- Just because they've seen us together...
- We are calling you to testify

41:42.075 --> 41:43.780
- at the hearing.
- There's no way in hell

41:43.806 --> 41:45.762
I'm testifying in that hearing.
You can't make me.

41:45.828 --> 41:48.762
You've already been subpoenated
and if you don't testify truthfully,

41:48.806 --> 41:50.451
I'll turn you into the US marshalls

41:50.528 --> 41:53.291
and then you're gonna have
a real big problem on your hands.

41:55.507 --> 41:57.163
God bless America!

41:58.508 --> 42:00.232
It's a shame, isn't it?

42:01.437 --> 42:03.671
It's a shame Tasha had to meet someone

42:03.717 --> 42:06.183
who flies her dirty laundry
like a freedom flag

42:06.216 --> 42:08.171
for the whole world to gawk at.

42:08.216 --> 42:10.340
You know, as far as I can tell,

42:10.386 --> 42:14.853
Tasha never had a problem
living within the military codes

42:14.887 --> 42:16.493
until she met you.

42:26.958 --> 42:29.502
Hi, they told me
I had to come here.

42:29.507 --> 42:32.193
- I hope you don't think... I would never...
- I know, I know.

42:38.007 --> 42:40.282
It was good to see you.

44:21.535 --> 44:25.342
???

44:26.065 --> 44:29.113
I think it's getting a little hot here,
don't you?

44:29.148 --> 44:32.393
Oh, let's see. Who's next?

44:32.426 --> 44:36.093
Wow! There are some hot women
here tonight.

44:36.127 --> 44:37.501
Oh, here's one.

44:37.536 --> 44:39.293
Hey, how are you doing?
What's your name?

44:40.848 --> 44:43.251
- Yeah, I don't think...
- Come on, you stay out of the crowd.

44:43.285 --> 44:45.332
Oooh! This is Molly, guys!

44:45.368 --> 44:48.642
Say hi to the crowd.
Don't be, don't be shy. Come on.

44:56.975 --> 44:58.130
Fucking...

45:43.596 --> 45:46.081
Alright, this is the
Los Angeles police department.

45:46.115 --> 45:48.032
Everybody out of the club.

45:48.078 --> 45:51.110
Everybody out of the club!

45:52.075 --> 45:53.942
Come on!

46:01.726 --> 46:05.030
I'm so glad you're a fan.
Thank you for not arresting her.

46:05.075 --> 46:07.791
We really appreciate that.
And if you could keep it

46:07.828 --> 46:10.513
out of the press, that would be

46:10.546 --> 46:12.632
really great, I think.

46:18.545 --> 46:20.643
Girl, not my party, but good job.

46:21.865 --> 46:22.993
- Did you have fun?
- I did.

46:23.028 --> 46:24.081
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:24.316 --> 46:26.842
I feel like shit. I'm gonna go and

46:26.886 --> 46:29.703
clean up. Do you wanna come over
and borrow something to wear?

46:29.736 --> 46:31.413
I'm totally straight.

46:31.448 --> 46:32.840
But you can keep dreaming.

46:35.245 --> 46:36.631
Come here for a second.

46:37.275 --> 46:39.262
Don't flatter yourself.

46:47.047 --> 46:48.690
Maybe, uh...

46:48.736 --> 46:52.080
Maybe we could somewhere else,
just, you and me.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.683
You just had a 10,000 dollars
???

46:54.725 --> 46:56.920
- Cindi!
- What? I'm just asking!

46:56.955 --> 46:59.053
Oh, yeah, Porter. You're fucked.
Alright?

46:59.085 --> 47:01.743
Fuck you and your rat-infested shithole.
Okay?

47:01.777 --> 47:04.350
Yeah, girl. I just named the rats after you.

47:04.395 --> 47:07.301
- Oh, really, you like those rats, huh?
- Oh, yeah, girl, I love 'em.

47:07.337 --> 47:09.602
- It's fucking on!
- Yeah, it is on, ain't it?

47:09.646 --> 47:12.233
You 'bout to go live with the rats.

47:12.275 --> 47:15.563
All your little friends. Buh-bye!

47:27.705 --> 47:29.432
- "Bondallica" by Bonde Do Role -

47:33.587 --> 47:35.353
I was looking for you.

47:35.398 --> 47:36.760
Come here.

47:36.806 --> 47:38.780
Thanks for taking me out tonight.

47:48.695 --> 47:50.253
I love you.

47:51.998 --> 47:53.600
I love you too.

48:14.555 --> 48:15.513
Cut!

48:18.995 --> 48:20.090
