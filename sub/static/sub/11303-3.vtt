Colonel Stowe may have been crazy,

Y'all know busting through

09:30.300 --> 09:33.258
Okay, so then you stole
the Genoa files from CID?

- What is it, Deputy?

10:36.829 --> 10:39.098
The last three guys your
district attorney cut loose

10:39.180 --> 10:42.058

- Vigilante?
- I think it's more than that.

See, all three releases
were connected to you.

10:49.308 --> 10:53.146

you've got the DA in your pocket.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.106

10:57.628 --> 10:59.018
Sheriff Lotus.

11:00.140 --> 11:03.018
- What do you think, Deputy?
- I think Brock makes a lot of noise,

11:03.148 --> 11:05.018
but he'd never come after you like that.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.858
- Then get me a name.
- It could get messy.

11:09.661 --> 11:11.978
Then you'll clean it up.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.459
You hired me to be
your eyes and your ears.

11:15.581 --> 11:19.659

but that costs more.

11:23.228 --> 11:25.498

up to my office and talk?

12:08.748 --> 12:11.946
The county coroner won't
release Rebecca's body to us.

12:12.027 --> 12:13.786
Yes, that's true.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.547
Unfortunately, the
body can't be released

12:15.661 --> 12:17.707

an official cause of death.

12:17.787 --> 12:19.418
The funeral must be held immediately.

12:19.501 --> 12:21.419

- This is our way.

you my entire department

12:31.421 --> 12:33.547
You have no right
to keep her from us.

12:33.628 --> 12:38.606

- [sobbing] Please, let us put her to rest.

12:42.559 --> 12:44.539

12:44.540 --> 12:48.138

12:48.268 --> 12:51.786
I'll try to move things along, okay?

12:53.100 --> 12:57.258
- I promise.
- Come. Let's go.

Again, I'm sorry for your loss.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.946
<i>Leo: With technology

<i>Why? Well, how can we

13:14.621 --> 13:15.866

13:15.980 --> 13:18.346
And by they, I mean the
United States government.

is enforce title 18, section 1030.

- That stubborn motherfucker.

25:23.387 --> 25:27.145
So they gave up
and they marked him for EDE.

- Extended detainment and exploitation.

- How do we get in there?
- You don't.

25:51.788 --> 25:54.666

- No one gets in, period.

25:54.747 --> 25:57.625
- Wrong answer, homes.
- [yelling] Wait! Wait!

25:57.739 --> 26:00.778

might be able to buy him out

26:02.059 --> 26:04.665
- Cut his fucking foot off.
- No, don't!

26:06.460 --> 26:09.738
Look, the government needs
plausible deniability,

so these places, they
are completely autonomous.

26:12.219 --> 26:15.177

26:15.308 --> 26:17.766

- How much?
- How much do you have?

26:26.107 --> 26:28.377
So much for early retirement.

26:58.379 --> 26:59.945

27:00.026 --> 27:03.945
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
- What the hell does that mean?

27:04.027 --> 27:06.858
It means they have no
further use for him.

27:06.939 --> 27:08.425
- When?
- Unclear.

27:08.508 --> 27:10.217

- We knew that, right?
- Yes.

42:03.258 --> 42:06.697
This is an 18-year-old
bottle of Glenlivet.

42:06.778 --> 42:09.817
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

42:21.546 --> 42:25.257
<i>Sugar: Come on, Job.
Drink up.</i>

42:25.386 --> 42:27.656
[gasps]

42:33.386 --> 42:36.296
I just need to get some rest.

42:38.218 --> 42:40.424
Then I'm going to grab
my take from Genoa,

42:40.507 --> 42:43.384
head back into the city,

42:43.499 --> 42:47.496
maybe set myself up with a p...
penthouse.

42:49.738 --> 42:51.256
What?

42:54.106 --> 42:57.497
Somebody better start talking now.

43:00.346 --> 43:02.297
Buying them off wasn't cheap.

43:02.378 --> 43:05.705
<i>Leo got away with the bag.</i>

43:07.658 --> 43:09.224
How much?

43:10.506 --> 43:15.577
- All of it.
- So after all that time, I got nothing.

43:15.658 --> 43:18.376
You still got your
place in the back, Job.

43:18.507 --> 43:20.024
<i>Carrie: No, he's not
gonna stay in a back room.</i>

43:20.138 --> 43:22.457
You're gonna come stay with me.

43:22.538 --> 43:24.504
<i>I'm gonna take care of you.</i>

43:24.619 --> 43:29.705
- The kids are away. It'll be quiet.
- And what about Gordon?

43:29.786 --> 43:32.936
I lost track.
Is he in or is he out?

43:36.299 --> 43:38.536
Gordon didn't make it.

43:49.098 --> 43:52.536
Thank you all for coming to get me.

43:53.786 --> 43:56.697
Next time you can tell
me why it took 20 months.

43:56.778 --> 43:58.296
<i>[door opens]</i>

44:00.058 --> 44:02.296
What the hell is this?

44:03.706 --> 44:05.384
<i>Brock: Lucas Hood.</i>

44:05.466 --> 44:08.617
You're under arrest for the
murder of Rebecca Bowman.

44:08.746 --> 44:09.577
Brock, is this a joke?

44:09.706 --> 44:13.385
Sir, I'm sorry,
but we have a warrant.

44:13.466 --> 44:17.041
- Brock, you know I didn't do it.
- Yeah? Then maybe you want

44:17.076 --> 44:18.665
to tell me how your blood
ended up inside of her car.

44:18.746 --> 44:20.296
<i>Nothing?</i>

44:20.426 --> 44:23.176
And I'm guessing you have no idea
how you knocked her up either.

44:24.138 --> 44:25.785
What?

44:25.898 --> 44:29.304
<i>Brock: Yeah, Bunker, put the
cuffs on this man. Let's go.</i>

44:34.298 --> 44:36.264
Sir.

44:43.658 --> 44:48.585
- Okay, wait a minute. This is...
- Hey. Cruz, stand down.

44:48.666 --> 44:50.936
I said stand the fuck down.

44:51.018 --> 44:52.855
<i>Let's go. Get him in the car.</i>

44:52.938 --> 44:54.457
It's okay.

45:03.259 --> 45:05.016
Sorry.

45:05.098 --> 45:10.384
So... did I miss anything
while I was gone?
