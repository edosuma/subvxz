00:45.080 --> 00:47.753
Thomas Allman.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.959
Thomas Allman, you have been found
unworthy of having existed.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.119
Mother?

00:54.840 --> 00:59.356
Your life and all memory of you
will be wiped from history.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.473
The void you occupied
in the space-time continuum

01:03.680 --> 01:08.549
will be allocated to a person
who was never given the gift of life.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.678
May they spend their time more wisely.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.155
Please. Why me? There must be others
who've lived worthless lives.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.113
All will be judged.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.799
It is complete. All that remains
is to delete your physical form.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.357
Sorry to disturb you, sir. Reality control.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.952
Coffee, sir.
Double caffeinated, quadruple sugar.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.793
- Nice one.
- Ah, Virgil's "Aeneid".

01:52.960 --> 01:56.350
Oh, the epic tale
of Agamemnon's pursuit of Helen of Troy,

01:56.520 --> 02:00.229
the classic work
by the greatest Latin poet who ever lived.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.318
- Yeah, it's the comic book version.
- Really?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.914
It's good, man. Absolutely full of history.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.558
"Zap! Pow! Ker-splat! Die in bed,
you Trojan pig-dog! Gnargh! Ker-pow!"

02:12.600 --> 02:16.036
I see they've remained faithful
to the original text.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.190
Don't discourage him. It's the only thing
he's read that doesn't have lift-up flaps.

02:23.240 --> 02:27.153
I dunno though. This wooden horse malarkey,
I'm not buyin' that.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.635
It's the most famous
military manoeuvre in history.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.718
The Greeks have been camped outside Troy,

02:32.880 --> 02:36.509
ker-powing and ker-splatting the Trojans
for almost a decade, yeah?

02:36.720 --> 02:40.269
- So?
- So suddenly, one morning, they're gone.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.398
Outside the city walls, they've left this gift,

02:43.560 --> 02:47.519
this tribute to their valiant foes,
a huge wooden horse,

02:47.680 --> 02:52.151
just large enough to happily contain
500 Greeks in full battle dress

02:52.320 --> 02:55.710
and still leave adequate room
for toilet facilities?

02:55.880 --> 02:59.998
Not one Trojan goes,
"That's a bit of a funny pressie.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.357
"What's wrong with socks and aftershave?"

03:03.560 --> 03:08.111
No, they just wheel it in
and go for an early night.

03:08.280 --> 03:12.512
People that stupid deserve to be ker-powed
and ker-splatted in their beds.

03:13.160 --> 03:18.996
The joke is that from this, we derive
the phrase "beware of Greeks bearing gifts",

03:19.160 --> 03:24.473
when it would be more logical to say, "Beware
of Trojans, they're complete smegheads. "

03:24.840 --> 03:27.752
Well, thank you, AJP Taylor.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.190
What was that?

03:30.400 --> 03:33.870
- That's strange. We've changed course.
- Are you sure, Holly?

03:34.040 --> 03:37.191
There's no course change programmed.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.029
And again.
Mark one eight zero - a complete turn.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.919
- We're heading back to Red Dwarf.
- Give me manual.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.071
- Agh!
- We're locked out!

03:46.240 --> 03:50.279
- Something's controlling the craft.
- Holly, any traffic around?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.119
- Nothing on the local scan.
- There must be...

03:53.320 --> 03:58.189
I am in possession
of the human Lister. Do not resist me.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.279
What happened to him?
His voice finally break?

04:02.480 --> 04:07.315
- Who are you?
- Tremble at my name. I am the Inquisitor.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.035
- The Inquisitor?
- Your vessel is under my control.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.193
It will return you
to your mother ship to face judgement.

04:15.400 --> 04:19.439
You will each present a case
to justify your existence.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.115
If you fail, you will be deleted.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.669
- Are you OK, sir?
- Yeah. God, I think so.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.231
- A little bit shaky.
- We should run you through the medi-scan.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.391
Yeah, OK.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.793
So, Kryten, you've heard of this Inquisitor?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.471
Only as a myth, a dark fable, a horror tale,

04:48.640 --> 04:51.791
told across the flickering embers
of a midnight fire

04:52.000 --> 04:56.596
wherever hardened space dogs gather
to drink fermented vegetable products

04:56.800 --> 05:00.509
and compete in tales of blood-chilling terror.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.960
A simple "yes" would have sufficed.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.949
- So who is he?
- What's his beef?

05:07.160 --> 05:10.630
Well, the legend tells of a droid,
a self-repairing simulant,

05:10.800 --> 05:15.237
who survives till the end of eternity,
to the end of time itself.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.838
After millions of years alone, he finally
reaches the conclusion that there is no God,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.915
no afterlife, and the only purpose
of existence is to lead a worthwhile life.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.839
And so the droid constructs a time machine

05:29.000 --> 05:33.869
and roams eternity, visiting every single
soul in history and assessing each one.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.679
He erases those who wasted their lives

05:36.840 --> 05:41.550
and replaces them with those that never had
a chance of life, the unfertilised eggs,

05:41.720 --> 05:43.950
the sperms that never made it.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.192
That is the Inquisitor.
He prunes away the wastrels,

05:47.360 --> 05:49.828
expunges the wretched
and deletes the worthless.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.031
We're in big trouble.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.435
Who's to say what's worthless?

05:54.640 --> 05:59.111
Oh, please! Look in the mirror.
Read your entry in "Who's Nobody".

06:00.040 --> 06:03.555
No, I mean it.
Who's to say what's worthwhile?

06:03.760 --> 06:06.877
Well, lying on your bunk reading "What Bike"

06:07.040 --> 06:11.830
and eating Sugar Puff sandwiches for eight
hours every day is unlikely to qualify.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.953
So because I haven't written any symphonies
or painted the Sistine Chapel, I'm prunable?

06:16.160 --> 06:20.312
No, because you're a totally worthless,
unwashed space bum, you're prunable.

06:20.520 --> 06:25.958
Precisely. The criterion is not fame,
it is simply to have lived a worthwhile life.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.597
Why did no one mention this before?

06:31.600 --> 06:35.832
If I'd been told that the object
was to lead a worthwhile life,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.389
I could have done something about it.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.712
All those charity telethons
when I used to pledge donations,

06:42.880 --> 06:46.555
I would have given them
MY credit card number.

06:47.680 --> 06:54.119
Sir, you don't have to be a philanthropist,
you simply have to seize the gift of life...

06:54.280 --> 06:56.271
- Oh, God.
- .. make a contribution...

06:56.440 --> 06:58.556
- Oh, God.
- .. no matter how small.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.669
You simply have to have lead a life that
wasn't totally egocentric and self-serving.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.950
You're doing this on purpose.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.516
- I'm just trying to make you feel better.
- Shut up, then!

07:10.320 --> 07:14.518
Hang on. Why should we take any notice
of some half-crazed rogue robot

07:14.680 --> 07:17.513
who's appointed himself judge
and jury to humanity?

07:17.680 --> 07:19.989
Why should we kowtow to his judgement?

07:20.160 --> 07:24.790
Because I have the power
to snap your body in two like a dry reed!

07:24.960 --> 07:26.951
Good answer, man! Good answer!

07:36.840 --> 07:40.719
- So where is he?
- See me now and tremble!

07:42.200 --> 07:47.513
The inquisition begins. Prove to me
you are worthy of the honour of life

07:47.680 --> 07:52.310
or drink deeply from the well
of nothingness for all eternity.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.080
I hate these "either/or" questions.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.236
Who is to be first?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.752
Lister!

08:00.880 --> 08:03.678
The hologram. You shall be first.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.269
Pardon? Sorry.

08:08.760 --> 08:14.471
You have been granted
the greatest gift of all - the gift of life.

08:15.880 --> 08:21.910
Tell me, what you have done
to deserve this superlative good fortune?

08:23.160 --> 08:26.869
Well, I say this with the highest respect,

08:27.040 --> 08:30.635
but what gives you the right to ask -

08:30.800 --> 08:35.874
no, actually, demand -
that answer of me, Your Magnificence?

08:37.200 --> 08:40.875
All must answer to the Inquisitor!

08:41.320 --> 08:44.357
How do I know I'll get a fair hearing?

08:44.520 --> 08:52.108
Because, like all who stand
before the Inquisitor, your judge shall be...

08:53.600 --> 08:55.716
.. yourself!

08:56.520 --> 09:00.479
- Oh, smeg.
- "Oh, smeg" indeed, matey.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.676
Everyone is judged by their own self?

09:02.880 --> 09:06.953
It's a bit metaphysical, I know,
but it's the only fair way.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.111
Now, then. Justify yourself.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.353
Well, first I...

09:11.560 --> 09:14.199
- Liar.
- I've done good things.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.518
- No, you haven't.
- In my heart, I tried to do good things.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.998
- No, you didn't.
- Look, I've tried to lead a good life.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.997
When?

09:26.560 --> 09:29.472
Ah! What's that? It's the Archangel Gabriel!

09:29.640 --> 09:32.279
Well, that's me converted! Hallelujah!

09:32.880 --> 09:38.034
You are a slimy, despicable, rat-hearted,
green discharge of a man, aren't you?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.311
Well... sort of, yes.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.353
So, then, justify yourself.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.676
What else could I have been?

09:46.840 --> 09:51.709
My father was a half-crazed military failure,
my mother was a bitch-queen from hell.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.270
My brothers had looks and talent.
What did I have?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.318
Unmanageable hair and ingrowing toenails.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.596
Yes, I admit I'm nothing.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.435
But from what I started with, nothing is up.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.838
Hi, buddy.

10:09.640 --> 10:14.156
This is your judgement day, bud.
I gotta be cruel. No favours.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.430
I'm hearing you on FM.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.872
I have to ask you the question -
justify your existence.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.076
What contribution have you made?

10:23.280 --> 10:28.479
I have given pleasure to the world
because I have such a beautiful ass.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.319
- Well, that's true.
- Can I go now?

10:31.520 --> 10:34.273
- That's your case?
- You need more?!

10:34.480 --> 10:36.835
Some might say that's a shallow argument.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.349
Some might say I'm a shallow guy.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.590
But a shallow guy with a great ass.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.872
- Sometimes you astonish even me.
- Thank you.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.639
Well, Kryten, justify yourself.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.478
I'm not sure I can.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.513
Surely your life is replete with good works.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.389
Few individuals
have lived a more selfless life.

10:59.600 --> 11:04.913
But I am programmed to live unselfishly.
Any good work comes not out of fine motives,

11:05.080 --> 11:09.278
but as a result of binary commands
I am compelled to obey.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.313
Well, then,
how can any mechanical justify himself?

11:12.520 --> 11:15.273
Only if he attempted to break his programming

11:15.440 --> 11:19.228
and conduct his life according
to values arrived at independently.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.510
Your argument invites deletion.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.076
- The rules are yours.
- Do you wish to be erased?

11:25.280 --> 11:28.397
I am programmed
not to wish for anything. I serve.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.036
In a human, this behaviour
might be considered stubborn.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.277
But I am not human, and neither are you.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.477
And it is not our place to judge them.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.790
I wonder why you do?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.109
Enough.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.997
Well... get out of this one, smeghead.

11:50.760 --> 11:55.117
- What you talkin' about?
- You know what you could've done,

11:55.280 --> 11:57.475
- what you could've become.
- So?

11:58.080 --> 12:01.390
You've got brains, man.
Brains you've never used.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.195
- So?
- So justify yourself.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.436
Spin on it!

12:11.240 --> 12:13.470
The inquisition is over.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.748
I have reached my verdict.

12:16.920 --> 12:22.153
Two ofyou have failed to become
that which you might so easily have been.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.871
You have lived without merit,
and so not lived at all.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.954
- You scum! You've wiped them out!
- Sir...

12:32.120 --> 12:34.793
He's crazy, Kryten.
He's erased Cat and Rimmer.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.276
- They are quite safe.
- Sir...

12:39.440 --> 12:42.079
I'm afraid we are to be erased.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.559
Ah.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.071
The Cat has lead a more worthwhile
life than us?

12:49.280 --> 12:53.319
He is a shallow and selfish creature,
as is the hologram.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.950
By their own low standards,
they have acquitted themselves.

12:57.120 --> 13:02.399
Whereas you and the mechanoid
could have been so much more.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.632
- What's this?
- We are being surgically removed from time.

13:09.800 --> 13:15.193
Every memory of us is being dissolved.
Our lives are being undone.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.076
It is complete. The time-lines are knitted.
Causality is healed.

13:20.240 --> 13:25.109
All that remains is to remove
your physical forms from existence.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.159
Well, if you've got some amazing plan
up your sleeve, Kryten,

13:29.320 --> 13:31.788
now's the time to mention it.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.678
No plan, sir.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.876
No sleeves.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.432
Perfect. Now, what did I do next?

13:44.600 --> 13:47.797
Now, hurry! Take the gauntlet and go!

13:48.000 --> 13:51.117
- What is goin' on?
- No time to explain.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.272
I've come from the future
to rescue you. Hurry!

13:54.920 --> 13:57.559
What about me... I mean you... I mean us?

13:57.760 --> 14:01.355
- I'm afraid we get killed.
- Killed? How?

14:01.560 --> 14:06.793
While I'm standing here explaining this,
the Inquisitor jumps me from behind.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.873
You can't save me.
Before you reach the storage bay,

14:11.040 --> 14:13.600
you must have decoded the gauntlet's controls.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.991
- How? Give us a clue?
- I cannot explain.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.436
For some bizarre reason, my final words are "enig".

14:21.240 --> 14:24.152
- "Enig"?
- Yes. Enig...

14:25.800 --> 14:28.155
- Come on, sir.
- He's just killed you!

14:28.320 --> 14:30.311
Sir, we have to go!

14:44.280 --> 14:48.034
You are not registered as personnel.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.112
- State your name and clearance code.
- It's us, Hol!

14:51.320 --> 14:56.110
- State your name and clearance code.
- Lister, D, 000-169.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.279
I have no record of your palm print.
Intruder alert!

15:00.440 --> 15:03.955
- Initiating override.
- State your name and clearance code.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.829
Logon name, Kryten.
Registration code, Additional 001.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.235
I have no record of your CPU ident.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.868
We don't exist any more.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.116
Tear gas!

15:25.920 --> 15:28.388
Oh, thank God it's you guys.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.353
- Move an eyebrow and you're dog meat.
- It's us!

15:31.560 --> 15:34.552
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Rimmer, it's me.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.991
- How do you know my name?
- It's on your uniform.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.749
Sir, they've never met us.
We are between realities.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.436
- They have no memory of us.
- I'll ask once more. What do you want?

15:46.640 --> 15:52.476
Yo, we're not the enemy. There's a guy here
somewhere obliterating people from history.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.349
- We used to be your shipmates.
- Only we've forgotten you

15:56.560 --> 15:59.836
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm convinced

16:00.840 --> 16:03.912
- Rimmer, I know you.
- Well, if you do,

16:04.080 --> 16:10.110
you'll know I'm the kind of hardened
ex-marine type guy you do not trifle with.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.631
No, you're not!

16:12.800 --> 16:15.712
- For the last time...
- Fiona Barrington.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.759
Fifteen years old. You got off with her
in your Dad's greenhouse.

16:19.920 --> 16:25.995
You thought you got lucky but it turned out
that you had your hand in warm compost.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.470
- How could I know that?
- Not true.

16:30.480 --> 16:35.395
You got three brothers. You're really mean.
You're a tremendous physical coward.

16:35.560 --> 16:40.588
You spent an afternoon with the Samaritans
and four people committed suicide.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.268
Your middle name's Judas.
You say it's Jonathan.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.830
You sign all your official letters AJ Rimmer, BSc.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.197
BSc stands for Bronze Swimming Certificate.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.198
You're a cheating, weaselly, lowlife scumbucket

16:53.360 --> 16:57.638
with all the charm
and social grace of a pubic louse.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.594
Gotta admit, bud.
He's got a handle on you there.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.836
Sirs, you've got to help us.
The Inquisitor will obliterate us.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.076
Who the smeg are these guys, Rimmer?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.113
Never mind that. Who the smeg are you?

17:14.319 --> 17:16.390
I the smeg am Lister.

17:16.599 --> 17:22.071
Of course. An alternative you. A David Lister
who never got a chance to exist.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.960
So we're kind of... sperms-in-law?

17:26.160 --> 17:28.435
- Yes, sir.
- Delicately put, sir.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.029
- So what do we do with them?
- Waste them.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.435
Rimmer, for smeg's sake!

17:34.360 --> 17:36.635
- He's such a dork.
- You're tellin' me?

17:36.840 --> 17:41.994
They come here with some fairy story, chained
together like Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.833
Let's open the door to oblivion for them.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.952
- Rimmer, no one's killing no one.
- Yeah, right.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.153
They've come from some freaky alternative
dimension to hijack this ship

17:52.320 --> 17:54.993
and do... ooh, weird things to us.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.357
I think we should stick them in the brig.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.519
I hate to say it,
but TransAm wheel arch nostrils is right.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.875
- Get moving.
- What did you call me?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.395
- Look, you know the score.
- Why do I know the score?

18:10.560 --> 18:14.155
Because you're me.
We're shot from the same gun barrel.

18:14.320 --> 18:18.108
Only difference is,
one did breast stroke, one did crawl.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.396
What are you trying to say?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.273
I'm saying...

18:24.520 --> 18:26.636
That's him, guys!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.395
This way!

18:42.240 --> 18:45.357
- Come on! Let's go!
- Let's go back!

18:45.560 --> 18:50.793
Oh, my God! Hang on a minute.
I can use this. Come on! Go!

18:53.120 --> 18:57.830
If we got down to the transport decks,
we could nick one of the Starbugs.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.309
Uh-oh. A door. Let's use an air vent.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.198
- No need.
- Sir?

19:02.360 --> 19:05.750
Look, I'm gonna do something
that's totally gross. Turn around.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.593
- What?
- Trust me, you don't wanna know.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.952
Logically, sir, there is only one way
you could have opened that door.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.429
I feel quite nauseous.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.795
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

19:27.960 --> 19:31.191
Oh, sir, you've got it in your jacket!

19:31.360 --> 19:37.230
- I got us out of the hold, didn't I?
- Sir, you are a sick, sick person.

19:37.400 --> 19:43.236
- How can you conceive of such an idea?
- Shut up or I'll beat you with the wet end!

19:43.400 --> 19:47.075
Sir, if mechanoids could barf,
I'd be onto my fifth bag by now.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.310
- You're a sick person!
- Come on!

19:55.080 --> 19:59.676
What's the point in trying
to get out of this? We already know we fail.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.394
Not so. We only know that I die.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.196
If my gambit results in your safety,
it will be a move well made.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.436
For myself, death holds no fear.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.349
- Oh, yeah?
- Sir, I am programmed to relinquish my life.

20:13.520 --> 20:19.038
That's why the 4000 Series was voted
"Android of the Year" five years running.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.910
I have as much interest in saving my own life
as a chronically depressed lemming.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.999
That's not true, is it? Not any more.

20:28.160 --> 20:33.439
And it's all because of me. It's my fault.
I made you break your programming.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.672
I taught you to lie,
to make your own decisions.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.832
I made you more... more human.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.031
I gave you a life to lose.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.270
Sir, with the greatest respect,
that is complete shash.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.473
Kryten, I know when you're lying.
Your right foot jiggles.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.518
- It's involuntary.
- Nonsense.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.236
I'm not afraid to die.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.470
For me, death holds no fear.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.671
I believe in Silicon Heaven.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.876
I believe in an afterlife for androids!

21:08.120 --> 21:11.351
- Haven't you broken those damn manacles?!
- Kryten!

21:12.840 --> 21:17.277
- I won't let it happen.
- Cause and effect, sir. It HAS happened.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.432
There's nothing we can do
except save your life.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.996
I think this is a variant
of the Enigma decoding system.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.197
- Enigma. "Enig" - Enigma.
- "Enig". Of course.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.032
My last words.

21:29.200 --> 21:34.069
Anyway, if this works, it should age
those manacles by half a million years.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.670
- If it doesn't work?
- It'll wipe out the universe.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.712
- Phew!
- What now?

21:41.880 --> 21:43.996
Well, now WE have the power.

21:46.040 --> 21:50.875
OK, we don't know you,
but we know we wanna be on your side.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.315
He killed our crew mates. He's a monster.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.671
- I'm the Cat, this is Rimmer.
- Yeah. Lister. Kryten.

21:56.880 --> 22:01.874
Look, I'm not in love with the idea
of pitching in with you, but needs must.

22:02.080 --> 22:06.835
You really don't remember me, do you?
How I used to get on your pecks.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.279
Like I'd be trimming me toenails with your
electric meat carver, and you'd go spare.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.233
Sir, we must get down to the storage bay.

22:15.400 --> 22:20.076
Remember my message. That is where we meet
the Inquisitor for the final confrontation.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.840
That's your plan? Go and face him?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.470
Nice plan
Shall I paint a bull's-eye on my face?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.752
Listen, Kryten. I've come up with something.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.071
- Yes, sir?
- I'm gonna use my brains for once.

22:33.240 --> 22:37.358
Considering the circumstances, sir,
do you really believe that's wise?

22:37.560 --> 22:40.199
- Give me the gauntlet.
- You don't understand it.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.796
- You'll have to shout instructions.
- Why don't I wear it?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.951
- You can't, Kryten.
- Why not?

22:46.120 --> 22:48.190
You're programmed not to kill.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.797
So, the mortals seek to challenge my mastery.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.310
Kryten, I can't work this thing.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.710
Gamma, delta, one, four, five.

23:24.680 --> 23:28.275
- Smeg. You youthed me.
- The sport begins.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.274
Now what the smeg have you done?

23:36.960 --> 23:39.918
Excuse me. Could I distract you for a second?

23:40.080 --> 23:41.638
Huh?

23:52.440 --> 23:56.877
"Excuse me.
Could I distract you for a second"?!

23:57.840 --> 24:01.196
It was the best I could ad-lib at the time, sir.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.275
- He got the Cat and Rimmer, though.
- I know.

24:06.440 --> 24:10.399
Look, I've got to go back in time
and sacrifice myself

24:10.560 --> 24:14.997
in order that we can get
into this mess in the first place.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.957
Yeah, sure.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.270
All in all,
today's been a bit of a bummer, sir.

24:21.480 --> 24:26.076
- How long before he unfreezes? Ten minutes?
- No. 8.4.

24:26.640 --> 24:31.475
- We'd better be right, Kryten.
- I know. Gauntlets.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.195
Now, what do I say when I pop up
behind the Inquisitor?

24:36.360 --> 24:41.388
- Er, "Perfect. Now what do I... "
- That's it. I've got it. I've got it.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.632
OK, big fella. It's dangling time.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.474
- Welcome back on-line.
- What are you doing?

24:55.640 --> 25:01.670
One way or the other, you killed
a lot of my friends this afternoon.

25:01.840 --> 25:06.277
In fact, you may never
get on my good side again.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.428
- Oops.
- So now you're going to kill me?

25:15.600 --> 25:21.072
I don't think so. You're a fat little human
who doesn't have the balls.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.069
Dumb talk for a guy
who's dangling over a chasm.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.518
I've seen inside your heart.
You don't have it in you.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.313
Oh, yeah?

25:34.280 --> 25:36.271
Bet your life?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.470
- I never intended to kill you.
- Oh, no?

25:47.440 --> 25:50.989
No. I intended to save your life.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.475
Save my life? Why?

25:54.480 --> 25:58.268
'Cause if I save your life, and you erase me,

25:58.440 --> 26:01.512
I won't be there to save your life, and you'll die.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.190
Chew on that, pal.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.398
You're giving me my gauntlet back?

26:10.600 --> 26:13.273
I'm all right. You can't touch me.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.673
You might've killed the others, but I'm OK.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.236
Oh, just one thing.

26:21.880 --> 26:28.319
If I erase you from history, you will never
have existed to kill me in the first place.

26:29.720 --> 26:34.396
- That's a point.
- So, in fact, I can erase you quite safely.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.152
Yeah.

26:39.120 --> 26:43.272
Yeah! It's the old backfiring
time gauntlet trick.

26:43.480 --> 26:47.268
You just bought yourself
a one-way ticket to oblivion.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.598
But you can't!
All my glorious work will be undone!

26:53.960 --> 26:56.599
- Oh, it worked!
- It worked?

26:56.800 --> 26:59.712
- You're a genius.
- It was your scheme, sir.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.872
- I simply re-programmed the gauntlet.
- So what now?

27:04.840 --> 27:08.799
Well, we wait for the time-space continuum
to reorder itself.

27:11.560 --> 27:15.348
I believe this is an appropriate juncture
to give me five, sir.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.597
Give you five? I can do better than that.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.876
I can give you fifteen.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.356
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

27:27.520 --> 27:30.796
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:30.960 --> 27:34.111
# Let me fly far away from here

27:34.280 --> 27:36.874
# Fun, fun, fun

27:37.040 --> 27:40.794
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:40.960 --> 27:44.191
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

27:44.360 --> 27:47.557
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:47.720 --> 27:50.917
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

27:51.080 --> 27:53.719
# Fun, fun, fun

27:53.880 --> 27:57.555
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:57.720 --> 28:00.154
# Fun, fun, fun

28:00.680 --> 28:04.912
# In the sun, sun, sun #
