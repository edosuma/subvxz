WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:05.756
Everybody,
I got bad news.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.007
We've been canceled.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.218
Oh no, Peter,
how could they do that?

00:09.301 --> 00:12.429
Well, unfortunately, Lois,
there's just no more room on the schedule.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.805
We've just got
to accept the fact

00:13.889 --> 00:15.933
that Fox has to make room
for terrific shows

00:16.016 --> 00:18.977
like Dark Angel,
Titus, Undeclared,

00:19.061 --> 00:21.271
Action,
That '80s Show,

00:21.355 --> 00:23.482
Wonderfalls, Fastlane,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.651
Andy Richter
Controls the Universe,

00:25.734 --> 00:28.779
Skin, Girls Club,
Cracking Up,

00:28.862 --> 00:32.115
The Pitts, Firefly,
Get Real,

00:32.199 --> 00:36.995
Freakylinks, Wanda at Large,
Costello, The Lone Gunmen,

00:37.079 --> 00:40.874
A Minute with Stan Hooper,
Normal, Ohio, Pasadena,

00:40.958 --> 00:45.504
Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie,
The Street, American Embassy,

00:45.587 --> 00:47.798
Cedric the Entertainer,
The Tick,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.800
Louie, and
Greg the Bunny.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.260
Is there no hope?

00:51.343 --> 00:52.761
Well, I suppose
if all those shows

00:52.845 --> 00:54.638
go down the tubes,
we might have a shot.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.559
It seems today
that all you see

00:58.642 --> 01:01.895
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

01:01.979 --> 01:05.899
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

01:05.983 --> 01:08.402
On which we used to rely?

01:08.485 --> 01:12.197
Lucky there's a family guy

01:12.281 --> 01:15.242
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

01:15.325 --> 01:16.910
All the things
that make us

01:16.994 --> 01:18.996
Laugh and cry

01:19.079 --> 01:24.168
He's a family guy!

01:30.090 --> 01:32.301
-What are you watching, Peter?
-Passion of the Christ.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.552
I tell you, Brian,
I can't believe

01:33.635 --> 01:35.345
that this guy's
just lying there taking it.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.472
If it was me,
I woulda done something about it.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.309
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:40.392 --> 01:45.355
Aah! Aah!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:45.439 --> 01:46.982
Hey! Hey!

01:47.065 --> 01:49.568
Stop it.
Stop it.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.819
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.404
-Okay.
-All right.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.822
Hi, boys.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.032
I didn't have my hand
down my pants.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.325
Mmm, good for you.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.659
I just bought us
some new sheets

01:57.743 --> 01:58.827
at Bed Bath and Beyond.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.037
Oh, boy, I hope you
stayed away

02:00.120 --> 02:01.413
from that Beyond section.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.626
Aaaaahhhh!

02:05.709 --> 02:07.419
Oh, here are the coffee mugs.

02:13.425 --> 02:17.387
Honey, what do you say
we, uh, christen these new sheets, huh?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.224
Why, Lois Griffin,
you naughty girl.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.808
(laughing)
That's me.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.894
You dirty hustler.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.063
You filthy,
stinky prostitute.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.689
Okay, I get it.

02:27.773 --> 02:31.235
You foul, venereal-disease-carrying,
streetwalking whore.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.237
All right,
that's enough.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.658
(bed springs creaking)

02:47.125 --> 02:48.293
(sighing)

02:48.377 --> 02:50.379
It's good to have land.

02:50.462 --> 02:54.466
(Peter and Lois giggling)

02:54.550 --> 02:55.884
LOIS: George!

02:55.968 --> 02:57.761
George?
Who the hell is George?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.012
George Clooney.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.640
Our sex is so dull for you
that you gotta fantasize

03:01.723 --> 03:02.766
about George Clooney?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.893
I'm sorry, honey.
I guess that things

03:04.977 --> 03:07.062
have become a little stale
for me.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.480
W-- I-- I don't know
what to do.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.774
I mean, I don't really know that much
about any kinky stuff.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.652
I mean, I-- I could hook
this car battery up to my nipples.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.820
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

03:14.903 --> 03:17.155
Oh, God! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:17.239 --> 03:18.240
This doin' it for you?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.867
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:19.950 --> 03:23.203
Oh, I don't know.
I just don't feel that spark anymore.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.205
I mean, our honeymoon.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.957
Ah, so much rug burn!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.168
Wait a second, Lois.
That's what we need.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.586
We'll go
on a second honeymoon.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.380
(gasps)
Peter, that's a wonderful idea!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.215
Yeah. We'll be just like
The Honeymooners!

03:35.299 --> 03:37.217
One of these days, Alice.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.760
One of these days...

03:38.844 --> 03:40.554
Yeah, yeah.
I know, Ralph.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.805
Right to the moon.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.724
(audience laughs)

03:43.807 --> 03:45.559
(audience gasps)

03:45.642 --> 03:46.643
Oh.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.066
Well, that's everything.
Now, remember, kids,

03:53.150 --> 03:56.111
Brian is in charge while your father and I
are out at Cape Cod.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.529
I'll take good care
of them, Lois.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.072
You guys
have a good time.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.657
(engine starts)

04:00.741 --> 04:02.242
LOIS: Be good.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.870
Bye, Mom, I love you!

04:04.953 --> 04:08.165
You know Brian, if I choose
to make stool in my pants right now

04:08.248 --> 04:09.875
you're the only one here
to change me.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.251
What do you think
of that? Mmm-hmm?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.419
-I'm not gonna change you.
-What?

04:12.503 --> 04:13.837
I said,
I'm not gonna change you.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.214
You can't be serious.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.882
Oh, what if-- what
if I make a fudgie?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.676
Well, I just won't,
I just won't, that's all. I just won't.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.802
Blast, I just did!

04:20.886 --> 04:21.929
(Chris and Meg shouting)

04:22.012 --> 04:23.263
Chris, cut it out!

04:23.347 --> 04:24.973
Brian, Chris
just picked his nose

04:25.057 --> 04:26.642
and he keeps
touching me with his finger!

04:26.725 --> 04:28.352
CHRIS:
What good is mining nose gold

04:28.435 --> 04:31.188
if I can't share it
with the townspeople?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.065
I swear to God,
these kids are gonna make me

04:33.148 --> 04:34.650
put a bullet
through my head.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.818
Well, if I was in charge,
we wouldn't be having this problem.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.195
You got some ideas?
Tell me.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.363
Oh, I'll tell you.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.823
Of course, I'll want
a favor in exchange.

04:41.907 --> 04:42.908
(laughing)

04:42.991 --> 04:44.201
How does it smell, dog?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.953
Does it smell like
servitude?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.204
(laughing)

04:47.287 --> 04:49.289
Aft torpedoes, fire!

04:51.542 --> 04:53.502
Lois?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.421
Hey, Lois, honey?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.800
Sweetheart?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.594
(brakes screech)
Aah!

05:02.678 --> 05:03.679
Oh, you're awake!

05:03.762 --> 05:05.597
Hey, uh,
can you hand me the pretzels?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.015
Here. Where are we?

05:07.099 --> 05:11.144
About two hours from Cape Cod's
most luxurious bed and breakfast.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.438
Oh, Peter,
this is gonna be wonderful.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.941
I'm so excited
I want to prep my diaphragm now.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.069
(laughs) Gross.
Hey, why don't you go back to sleep?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
I'll wake you up
when we get there.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.072
Okay.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.587
(Peter laughing)

05:36.670 --> 05:38.380
PETER: Look
at all those hamburgers.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.133
You can't eat all
those hamburgers, you stupid fellow!

05:41.258 --> 05:44.428
(car thudding)
Oh, jeez!

05:48.390 --> 05:51.685
Ah, he's gonna do it!
Oh, he's so ridiculous.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.355
You hear me,
you ridiculous man? You're-- whoa!

05:55.439 --> 05:57.357
(screaming)

05:58.442 --> 06:00.527
Peter, what the hell
is wrong with you?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.154
I fall asleep
for 10 minutes

06:02.237 --> 06:03.780
and you plow the car
into a tree?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.408
Oh, my God!
You gotta pay attention to the road.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.035
We could have been killed!

06:08.118 --> 06:09.870
I mean,
look at the front of our car.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.289
It's totaled.
It's completely totaled, Peter!

06:12.372 --> 06:13.540
Oh, this is just terrific.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.708
How are we gonna get--

06:14.791 --> 06:15.959
Oh, my God!

06:16.043 --> 06:17.085
I knew I shoulda driven.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.378
I should always drive.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.672
I cannot trust you,
Peter Griffin!

06:28.680 --> 06:30.432
Dear God,
this is where we're sleeping?

06:30.516 --> 06:33.227
Oh, come on, Lois. They said they'd
have the car fixed by tomorrow,

06:33.310 --> 06:36.104
and then
our second honeymoon's back on track, huh?

06:36.188 --> 06:37.606
Peter,
there's a hooker on the bed.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.775
-Hi.
-Stand perfectly still, Lois.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.402
Their vision is based
on movement.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.238
Where did you go?

06:44.363 --> 06:45.948
(crickets chirping)

06:46.031 --> 06:48.825
ANNOUNCER: And now back
to Two and a Half Men.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.663
(all screaming)

06:52.746 --> 06:54.414
Kill me!

06:54.498 --> 06:57.167
-Turn it, Chris. I wanna watch
-George Lopez.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.086
That show only furthers
the stereotype

06:59.169 --> 07:00.796
that George Lopez
is funny.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.131
-Give me that! Let go.
-Chris, give me the remote.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.633
-Chris, stop!
-Stop doing that!

07:04.716 --> 07:06.176
Chris--
(gasps) My hat!

07:06.260 --> 07:07.719
(laughing)

07:07.803 --> 07:09.680
Wear it now.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.849
(both screaming)

07:11.932 --> 07:14.643
Hey, uh, uh, you two
better settle down.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.811
Chris, give Meg
her hat.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.479
I don't have
to listen to you.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.440
You're a dog!
You don't have a soul!

07:20.524 --> 07:21.525
Ow.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.235
Don't take that.
Raise your voice to them.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.654
Hey! Knock it off!

07:27.281 --> 07:30.075
Look, you kids are obviously
in need of some type of activity,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.785
so, uh, uh,
I don't know,

07:31.869 --> 07:32.995
what do you say
we read a book or something?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.330
Stewie, what does Peter
have on his bookshelf?

07:35.414 --> 07:37.624
Uh, two Garfield books

07:37.708 --> 07:40.085
and the novelization
of the movie Caddy Shack.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.755
"Mananananana," said Ty,
sinking yet another ball.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.842
"mananananana--"
(phone ringing) Oh, hang on.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.594
Oh, thank God.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.597
"Garfield at Large,
by Jim Davis."

07:51.680 --> 07:53.599
Now, as you can see
in this panel,

07:53.682 --> 07:56.018
Garfield doesn't
care for Nermal,

07:56.101 --> 07:59.646
but like him or not,
Nermal is here to stay.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.107
Or is he?
Let's read on.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.817
Okay, I'll be there.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.569
Peter and Lois
were supposed to chaperone

08:05.652 --> 08:07.362
Chris' school dance
tomorrow night,

08:07.446 --> 08:08.947
so, I guess
it's up to me.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.240
You mean it's up to us.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.783
Clearly, you need my help
with this parenting thing,

08:11.867 --> 08:13.452
you're too stupid
to do it alone.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.495
Besides, I know
how to deal with children,

08:15.579 --> 08:17.164
Unlike Mr. Geppetto.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.669
Oh, no.
I dropped my glasses.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.338
Uh, by the way,
uh, Pinocchio,

08:24.421 --> 08:26.340
uh, there was a cookie
missing from the jar.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.342
did you, uh,
did you take it by any chance?

08:28.425 --> 08:31.303
Yes, Papa Geppetto.
I'm sorry.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.721
Are you sure
you took it?

08:32.804 --> 08:35.474
Because, uh,
I'd believe you if you said you didn't.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.976
No, I took it, papa.
I wouldn't lie to you.

08:38.060 --> 08:40.979
You could try. Who knows?
You might get away with it.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.026
900 bucks
to fix the car.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.903
That was all the money
we had for this trip.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.364
Look, Peter,
this second honeymoon was a nice thought,

08:50.447 --> 08:51.907
but maybe we should
just go home.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.991
(sighing)

08:53.075 --> 08:54.910
Coming up,
handsome mustachioed man

08:54.993 --> 08:57.287
recaps news
in pleasing baritone.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.790
Stay tuned for this...
and more.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.459
But first,
Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa

09:02.543 --> 09:03.544
is on hand for the opening

09:03.627 --> 09:05.754
of Manhattan's
newest luxury hotel.

09:05.838 --> 09:09.258
Diane, I am standing outside
the Park Barrington Hotel

09:09.341 --> 09:11.802
because they don't
allow Asians inside.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.097
Fancy place. Boy, that'd make
some second honeymoon, huh?

09:15.180 --> 09:18.892
The Park Barrington
is already attracting some big names,

09:18.976 --> 09:22.312
such as
Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson,

09:22.396 --> 09:25.065
who has his own room
on permanent reserve.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.985
A room which he barely uses.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.279
Barely uses, huh?

09:30.362 --> 09:32.030
Lois, I just got an idea!

09:32.114 --> 09:35.158
Much better than that time
I experimented with gene splicing.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.160
Uh, Lois, quick question.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.037
Do we have any Tylenol?

09:39.121 --> 09:42.249
(music playing)

09:44.251 --> 09:45.878
Oh, how I envy them, dog.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.713
They've got their whole lives
ahead of them.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.298
Oh, man,
look at that kid.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.091
That is one
ugly eighth grader.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.635
You don't wanna
hurt yourself dancing.

09:53.719 --> 09:57.639
Make sure you stretch out
those creamy hamstrings.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.767
Come on, Chris.
It's just vodka.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.562
Jake swiped it
from his dad's liquor cabinet.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.439
Yeah, see?
It's good.

10:05.522 --> 10:09.318
Well, okay.
Maybe just one sip.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.737
Christopher Griffin,
is that alcohol?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.739
Mister,
you're in serious trouble.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.866
He's absolutely
right, kids.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.784
Because when you drink,
nobody wins.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.746
In fact, last year alone,
there were over 27,000 deaths

10:20.829 --> 10:23.749
from chronic liver disease
as a result of alcohol abuse.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.000
ALL: Now we know.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.252
And knowing
is half the battle.

10:27.336 --> 10:32.382
G.I. Joe!

10:36.053 --> 10:38.222
Peter,
we can't afford this.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.058
No, but Mel Gibson can.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.020
Uh, excuse me,
I'm Mel Gibson,

10:45.103 --> 10:47.439
here for the key
to my specially reserved room.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.690
You're Mel Gibson?

10:48.774 --> 10:50.943
Yes, I've put on a few pounds
for my next role.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.153
I play Peter Griffin,
a heroic warrior

10:53.237 --> 10:56.532
who defied the English
to free England from the English.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.451
Holy mackerel!
Let me show you to your room, Mr. Gibson!

11:00.702 --> 11:02.704
Peter, the toilet paper
is made of money.

11:02.788 --> 11:03.872
Yeah, and look at this.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.791
They even got some of that
high-class British porn.

11:05.874 --> 11:10.003
Almost. Almost. Almost.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.922
-There we are.
-Well done.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.717
Did you think
you were cool?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.970
Did you think
you were grown up? Hmmmm?

11:18.053 --> 11:19.972
I didn't actually
drink any of it.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.932
Besides, Jake Tucker
gave it to me.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.350
Well, we are going
to have a talk

11:23.433 --> 11:25.352
with Jake's parents
tomorrow after my burping.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.396
And, in the meantime,
you're grounded, Chris.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.314
Oh, come on.
That sucks!

11:29.398 --> 11:30.524
Do you want us
to pull over?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.150
I don't care what you do!

11:32.234 --> 11:35.070
Oh, we'll pull over.
We'll pull over. Pull over.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.154
(tires screech)

11:36.238 --> 11:39.950
(crying)

11:41.368 --> 11:44.288
If your teachers ask about your bruises,
what do you tell them?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.374
I got hit
by a baseball!

11:47.457 --> 11:50.794
(crying)

11:50.878 --> 11:53.797
(Peter and Lois giggling)

11:53.881 --> 11:54.923
LOIS: Oh, Mel!

11:55.007 --> 11:56.758
Mel? Wait a minute.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.011
You were fantasizing
about Mel Gibson.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.097
You-- You don't find me
attractive anymore.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.349
Honey, I'm sorry.
I know you're tryin',

12:04.433 --> 12:07.102
but you can't force
the spark back into our marriage.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.813
Well, then I guess
this whole second honeymoon

12:09.897 --> 12:11.523
-was a waste of time.
-Peter--

12:11.607 --> 12:12.858
I don't wanna
talk about it!

12:12.941 --> 12:14.776
I'm just gonna
watch British porn.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.863
You know, Margaret,

12:17.946 --> 12:19.823
We could have
sexual intercourse right now.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.991
Yes, yes we could.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.159
Mmm, but, let's not.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.915
Do you think
we were too hard on Chris tonight?

12:27.998 --> 12:30.542
What? Oh, God,
no, no.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.629
No, no,
I don't-- I don't think so.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.464
-Do you?
-Oh, no, I just

12:35.547 --> 12:38.634
always feel badly
when we have to be strict.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.386
Oh, did I remember
to turn the stove off?

12:41.470 --> 12:42.471
Yes.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.225
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened, Peter.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.018
I guess I'm goin' through
a phase right now

12:48.101 --> 12:49.895
where I'm only attracted
to handsome men.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.313
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.982
Just admit that there's
no excitement left in our marriage,

12:54.066 --> 12:55.526
go home and spend
the rest of our lives

12:55.609 --> 12:57.236
looking at each other
across the breakfast table,

12:57.319 --> 12:59.321
talkin' about how much
we both like Total?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.907
-Oh, I love Total.
-Oh, actually, so do I.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.075
And it's healthy for us, too--

13:03.158 --> 13:04.701
Oh, God!
It's startin' already!

13:04.785 --> 13:07.204
Lois, we are screwed.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.708
Wow!

13:11.792 --> 13:14.545
Mel Gibson's
secret screenin' room.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.547
Hey, what's this?

13:22.094 --> 13:24.680
The messiah... he's gone.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.265
Where did he go?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.229
Hang on.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.983
Man, you crazy, Jesus.
You crazy!

13:36.066 --> 13:38.694
That's what
my ex-wife said.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.405
For the son of God,
you sure are a son of a--

13:41.488 --> 13:43.532
BOTH: Whoooa!

13:43.615 --> 13:47.953
ANNOUNCER: Chris Tucker.
And Jim Ca-- Caziv-- Cavi-- Ca-veez-il?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.037
Is that it?

13:49.121 --> 13:50.455
The guy from the first one?

13:50.539 --> 13:54.751
Passion of the Christ 2:

13:54.835 --> 13:55.961
(gun goes off)

13:56.044 --> 13:59.173
(guns firing)

14:02.634 --> 14:03.969
You know
how to use one of these?

14:04.052 --> 14:06.263
You know
how to use one of these?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.432
(explosions)

14:08.515 --> 14:11.768
ANNOUNCER: This July,
let he who is without sin

14:11.852 --> 14:15.147
kick the first ass.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.982
Oh, man,
that's all we need,

14:17.065 --> 14:19.109
more Mel Gibson
Jesus mumbo jumbo.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.278
Well, not
if I have anything to say about it!

14:21.361 --> 14:24.323
I am gonna make sure
this never sees the light of day.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.908
Peter, are you crazy?

14:25.991 --> 14:27.993
Stealin'
Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes,

14:28.076 --> 14:29.786
and Nazi paraphernalia
is one thing,

14:29.870 --> 14:31.788
but this
is a multi-million-dollar film,

14:31.872 --> 14:33.790
and
he's a very powerful man.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.001
He could have us
arrested or-- or killed.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.586
It's
worth the risk, Lois,

14:37.669 --> 14:40.589
to save the world
another two hours of torture.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.176
We gotta get rid of this thing
for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy

14:44.259 --> 14:46.345
and all the other
beloved children's characters.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.429
Let's go!

14:48.931 --> 14:50.432
Pardon me.
We work for Mel Gibson.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.184
Seems he left something
very valuable

14:52.267 --> 14:53.852
in his room,
and we're here to retrieve it.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.063
Mr. Gibson
just checked out a moment ago.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.689
There he goes now!

14:57.773 --> 14:59.816
Oh-oh, Lois, run!

14:59.900 --> 15:01.360
Hey, stop!

15:08.742 --> 15:11.245
Uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.337
They're gainin' on us.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172
Oh, we never shoulda
stolen this film.

15:22.256 --> 15:24.049
Oh, man,
this is even more intense

15:24.132 --> 15:26.093
than that time
I forgot how to sit down.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.685
Don't worry, Lois,
I think I know how to lose them.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.646
(people screaming)

15:40.148 --> 15:41.942
Peter, what the hell
are you doin'?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.235
Lois, trust me.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.778
How many times
have I done this before?

15:44.862 --> 15:46.822
All right,
but be careful.

16:01.753 --> 16:07.050
(both screaming)

16:08.594 --> 16:09.636
(tires screeching)

16:10.804 --> 16:12.014
(ringing doorbell)

16:12.097 --> 16:14.099
Okay, now, be polite,
and for God's sake,

16:14.183 --> 16:15.976
don't mention anything
about his kid's face.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.354
Oh, shut up!
I am always so polite.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.649
Ha... I, uh,
hope we don't wind up on the evening news

16:22.733 --> 16:24.693
-'cause of this.
-(chuckles)

16:24.776 --> 16:26.904
You're funny.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.114
Ah, Brian,
please come in.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.117
Can my wife Stacy
get you anything?

16:32.201 --> 16:34.369
-Go to hell, Tom.
-Already there, hon.

16:34.453 --> 16:38.165
Yes, well, uh, Mr. Tucker,
uh, it seems your son Jake had some vodka

16:38.248 --> 16:41.251
at the school dance
and, uh, Chris got blamed for it.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.754
This, uh, this--
this whole situation has just turned

16:43.837 --> 16:45.672
his whole life
upside-down face.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.305
It's no concern of mine
if it's turned his life upside-down face.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.140
Jake's a good boy.
Aren't you, Jake?

16:55.224 --> 16:56.266
Yeah!

16:56.350 --> 16:57.434
-Look, Mr. Tucker, I--
-We're through here.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.019
Get out
of my house, Benji!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.396
Well fine! If you're gonna be that way
about it, maybe I'll do this.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.148
-Yeah, look at this.
-Stop that!

17:03.232 --> 17:04.691
-Oh, yeah,
you don't like this, huh? -Stop it!

17:04.775 --> 17:06.443
-Yeah, this is what Benji would do.
-Stop doing that in my carpet!

17:06.527 --> 17:08.946
-Hey! Knock it off!
-Oh, boy, that feels so good.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.240
-Stop it! Stop it!
-That feels so good.

17:12.908 --> 17:14.034
There's gotta be
a way to get back

17:14.117 --> 17:15.494
at Jake Tucker
for what he did to Chris.

17:15.577 --> 17:19.331
I know! I know! I know!
Let's plant drugs in his locker.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.166
Oh, my God!
That's a great idea.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.835
Yeah,
thought you'd like that.

17:22.918 --> 17:25.337
Hey, look at that
Yosemite Sam mud flap.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.714
You better
stay back, Brian.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.424
(grunts)

17:30.425 --> 17:32.594
(sighing)
I think we lost them.

17:33.679 --> 17:36.557
You stay here.
I'm gonna go bury this film.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.603
Well, Mel Gibson,
this is one piece of crap

17:41.687 --> 17:44.022
the world will never
have to suffer through.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.190
(snickers)

17:45.274 --> 17:46.900
I am so clever.
That's why they picked me

17:46.984 --> 17:49.611
to convince Congress
to go to war.

17:49.695 --> 17:52.948
There is no just cause
for an invasion of Iraq.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.157
Well, that may be.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.576
But what
we're all forgetting is,

17:55.659 --> 17:59.204
-anyone who doesn't want
to go to war is gay. -I wanna go to war.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.956
ALL: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
We should definitely go.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.124
ALL: Yes, we should totally
go to war.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.793
I was the first one
who wanted to go to war!

18:07.337 --> 18:10.883
(airplane engine whirring)

18:13.886 --> 18:15.596
(screams)

18:18.891 --> 18:19.892
(screaming)

18:19.975 --> 18:21.602
LOIS: Peter!

18:23.103 --> 18:25.230
Lois!

18:39.745 --> 18:41.455
Don't
take this personally, Mrs. Griffin.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.290
I'm doing this
because I have to.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.875
What are you
gonna do to me?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.376
Oh, what are you
gonna do to me?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.337
As soon as your husband
gives me what I want,

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
you're free to go.

18:49.505 --> 18:51.381
(door opening)
PETER: Anybody home?

18:51.465 --> 18:52.508
Peter!

18:52.591 --> 18:54.718
All right, Gibson.
I want my wife back.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.054
Or a woman of equal
physical attractiveness.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.597
Where's the film?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.725
Come on, honey,
let's get outta here.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.268
Peter,
you're just gonna give him the film?

19:03.352 --> 19:05.562
Don't worry, Lois.
There's a dog turd in there.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.898
But by the time
he finds out, we'll be long g--

19:07.981 --> 19:09.233
There's a dog turd in here.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.068
-Uh-oh, Lois?
-What?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.194
Jump!

19:12.277 --> 19:13.695
(both scream)

19:14.196 --> 19:15.322
No, wait!

19:15.405 --> 19:17.866
I'll deal
with them myself.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.625
LOIS: We're on top
of the monument.

19:26.708 --> 19:27.709
Holy crap!

19:27.793 --> 19:29.378
(gun fires)

19:31.964 --> 19:32.965
(bullet ricocheting)

19:34.591 --> 19:36.969
You know, I know
this is the wrong time to be star struck,

19:37.052 --> 19:39.638
but Mel Gibson
is shooting at us!

19:40.889 --> 19:42.558
(screaming)

19:43.767 --> 19:45.310
Peter, help!

19:45.394 --> 19:47.145
Oh, man. I'm comin', Lois.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.480
(laughing)

19:48.564 --> 19:51.316
Hey, Lois, look.
I'm a booger. (laughing)

19:51.400 --> 19:53.151
Peter, for God's sake!

19:53.235 --> 19:54.987
Oh, okay, okay. Grab my hand.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.488
(gun clicking)

19:56.572 --> 19:57.573
(both gasp)

19:57.656 --> 20:00.242
And now, Mr. Griffin...
I want that film.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.996
Oh, sure. It's, uh, right over there
in President Rushmore's mouth.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.624
(screaming)

20:09.918 --> 20:10.919
My God!

20:11.003 --> 20:12.838
He just walked
right over the edge.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.173
Of course, he did.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.550
Christians don't believe
in gravity.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.428
(groaning)

20:19.511 --> 20:21.930
Peter, it's back.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.098
What, that rash?

20:23.182 --> 20:24.224
No, no, the spark.

20:24.308 --> 20:28.729
Honey, I have never been
more attracted to you than I am right now.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.480
Really? Wow!

20:30.606 --> 20:32.149
Hey, so I guess
this honeymoon

20:32.232 --> 20:33.275
was just
the kind of excitement

20:33.358 --> 20:34.610
our marriage needed. Huh?

20:34.693 --> 20:36.445
I guess it just goes to show
that you--

20:36.528 --> 20:37.946
Shut up
and let's do it!

20:38.030 --> 20:39.990
(both moaning)

20:40.073 --> 20:42.701
(both laughing)

20:42.784 --> 20:43.911
LOIS: Oh, Peter!

20:43.994 --> 20:45.162
PETER: Yes!

20:45.245 --> 20:47.122
Hey, hey, Jefferson,
check it out.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.790
Chick gettin' nailed
on my head.

20:48.874 --> 20:52.044
Sweet. Hey, Teddy,
pass the word down to Frankenstein.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.795
Oh, ha-ha!

20:55.214 --> 20:58.175
In local news, a Buddy Cianci
Junior High School student

20:58.258 --> 21:00.052
has been arrested
for possession of drugs.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.303
The student
has been sentenced

21:01.386 --> 21:03.305
to 200 hours
of community service

21:03.388 --> 21:05.057
and is a very bad boy.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.517
We now go
to Ollie Williams

21:06.600 --> 21:08.352
for the punishment
forecast. Ollie?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.187
-He gonna get it!
-Thanks, Ollie.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.355
Now this.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.773
So you actually put coke
in that kid's locker?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.858
-Yup.
-Wow, where'd you get it?

21:14.942 --> 21:15.943
Oh, I got a guy.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.569
Don't let it get
the best of you.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.363
I used to be a lawyer.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.864
See you next week.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.824
Good
to be back, America.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.667
