00:42.484 --> 00:43.618
Okay, senior year

00:43.652 --> 00:45.553
in Clear Lake,
California was a blur.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.455
I graduated second in our class,

00:47.489 --> 00:49.758
did an internship with
the DA, and applied to

00:49.791 --> 00:52.460
my parents alma mater,
Georgetown University.

00:55.097 --> 00:58.533
But most importantly, I
started going out with Chris.

01:11.314 --> 01:13.748
We totally
didn't make sense on paper.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.751
I was this girl who liked
to sit on the dock and draw,

01:16.785 --> 01:18.988
and make my own graphic novels.

01:19.021 --> 01:21.390
He wash this old school
guy who barely graduated,

01:21.424 --> 01:24.026
and spent all of his time
working on his motorcycle.

01:31.566 --> 01:34.736
I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.

01:37.173 --> 01:40.376
I could be myself around
Chris. He saw me for me.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.918
Give Ry a hug for me.

01:48.951 --> 01:50.419
Yeah.

01:50.453 --> 01:51.253
Love you.

01:52.888 --> 01:55.358
We pretended that
summer would last forever,

01:55.391 --> 01:57.994
like the future
didn't even exist.

01:58.027 --> 01:59.929
Maybe it was easier that way.

01:59.962 --> 02:02.064
After all, we were in love.

02:03.232 --> 02:05.334
What are
you thinking about?

02:05.368 --> 02:07.103
How incredible this place is.

02:13.476 --> 02:15.577
You're distracting me.

02:15.610 --> 02:16.811
No, it's good.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.680
Only good?

02:20.216 --> 02:22.617
Well, I
mean, no it's great.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.987
Only great?

02:25.021 --> 02:26.088
I like the humps.

02:27.289 --> 02:28.757
You make good humps.

02:28.790 --> 02:29.724
Thanks, baby.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.662
It's amazing.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.630
Only amazing?

02:38.267 --> 02:39.868
You look perfect.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.377
Did you open it?

03:55.411 --> 03:56.212
Well?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.052
I got accepted
for next semester.

04:03.085 --> 04:03.919
Oh my God!

04:05.888 --> 04:06.754
Yep.

04:08.891 --> 04:10.359
Time to celebrate.

04:10.392 --> 04:12.827
Actually, I'm going to
Julia's party with Chris.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.531
Yeah, but not on a bike,
right? Not the motorcycle?

04:15.564 --> 04:17.699
No no, I made that
very very clear.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.345
Why don't you guys
spend the night with us?

04:29.378 --> 04:32.181
We could order takeout,
celebrate the big news together.

04:34.049 --> 04:37.153
Yeah, maybe next
time I get in college.

04:37.186 --> 04:38.120
Oh, you're funny.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.322
She got in.

04:49.764 --> 04:50.599
You look good.

04:52.401 --> 04:53.202
Only good?

04:53.235 --> 04:54.869
Great.

04:54.904 --> 04:55.703
Perfect.

05:01.243 --> 05:03.379
Everything okay?

05:03.412 --> 05:04.846
Yeah.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.949
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

05:06.982 --> 05:07.815
Okay.

05:13.122 --> 05:15.491
So they still want me dead, huh?

05:15.524 --> 05:16.358
Yeah.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.694
Just a little dead.

06:07.343 --> 06:08.510
This is amazing.

06:08.544 --> 06:10.980
Thanks. Come on, come here.

06:12.915 --> 06:16.751
Everybody. Cut the
music for a second.

06:16.784 --> 06:19.588
Thank you all so much
for coming out tonight.

06:19.622 --> 06:22.591
It means everything to have
the support of close friends.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.426
I have an announcement to make.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.329
You all know Riley.

06:27.363 --> 06:28.564
Woo woo!

06:28.597 --> 06:30.199
Well, she decided
that she's too smart,

06:30.232 --> 06:31.833
and too cool, and
generally baller

06:31.866 --> 06:33.868
to go to regular old
state, like most of us.

06:33.902 --> 06:36.905
So, she just got brilliant news.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.141
She'll be heading East
to Georgetown as soon as

06:39.174 --> 06:40.943
her internship with the
District Attorney's done,

06:40.976 --> 06:42.177
which will be in?

06:43.379 --> 06:44.313
Five weeks.

06:44.346 --> 06:45.847
Five weeks.

07:02.164 --> 07:03.365
But I thought you wanted this.

07:03.399 --> 07:04.566
I thought you wanted
to stay together.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.901
We can do the
long distance thing.

07:05.934 --> 07:07.770
Babe, it can work for us.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.338
Come on, we're different.

07:17.413 --> 07:20.082
So, Riley the lawyer, huh?

07:20.115 --> 07:21.183
Yeah.

07:21.216 --> 07:22.318
Yeah, that's the plan.

07:24.086 --> 07:24.920
What?

07:27.089 --> 07:30.993
Because it sounds like you
don't want me to have a career.

07:31.026 --> 07:32.594
What? No that's not.

07:32.628 --> 07:33.929
I want you to be you.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.631
How am I not being me?

07:35.664 --> 07:37.333
You're creative, Ry.

07:37.366 --> 07:39.468
I'm going into law, Chris.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.637
Come on, it's
already been decided.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.707
Drawing is something I do for
fun, but I'm not an artist.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.610
Yeah.

07:48.644 --> 07:50.979
I need another drink.

07:51.013 --> 07:51.846
Chris?

08:21.744 --> 08:23.212
What happened to him?

08:23.245 --> 08:24.613
Get off.

08:24.646 --> 08:25.881
Oh, okay.

08:25.914 --> 08:29.051
Hey Nate, can I use your car?

08:29.084 --> 08:30.352
Two shots, two hours ago.

08:31.253 --> 08:34.022
I'm fine.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.290
Thanks.

08:36.759 --> 08:37.760
No glove, no love.

09:13.195 --> 09:17.199
This isn't you Ry,
it's your parents.

09:22.838 --> 09:23.672
I got it.

09:26.508 --> 09:28.010
Don't.

09:28.043 --> 09:30.179
Let me do it, let me do it.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.046
Just stop.

09:37.085 --> 09:37.986
You know I love you, Ry.

09:39.555 --> 09:41.557
You know that right?
I love you so much.

09:59.675 --> 10:00.509
You okay?

10:03.445 --> 10:04.279
No!

10:21.530 --> 10:23.432
Hey, sweetheart.

10:23.465 --> 10:24.833
Hey, Ry.

10:24.867 --> 10:25.801
How you feeling?

10:27.269 --> 10:28.470
What happened?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.472
You were in an accident.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.707
You spent the night
at the hospital.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.475
You were in and out
of consciousness.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.210
You don't remember?

10:35.244 --> 10:36.645
No.

10:36.678 --> 10:37.713
You had a concussion
from the airbag.

10:37.746 --> 10:39.414
But the MRI came back fine.

10:40.549 --> 10:42.017
The doctor said you'd
probably be groggy

10:42.050 --> 10:44.753
for a couple of days but, you're
gonna make a full recovery.

10:46.054 --> 10:47.656
Where's Chris?

10:47.689 --> 10:48.490
Right here.

10:53.462 --> 10:55.030
Ry?

10:55.063 --> 10:55.864
Daddy?

11:04.540 --> 11:05.407
They tried.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.515
Where's Chris?

11:14.483 --> 11:15.885
Why are you lying to her?

11:19.688 --> 11:20.722
Ry, I'm right here, I'm. Ry?

11:29.598 --> 11:30.432
No.

11:31.433 --> 11:32.969
- Hey!
- Riley.

11:33.002 --> 11:35.137
Someone look at me. Someone
look at me, I'm right here!

11:35.170 --> 11:36.271
I want to see him.

11:36.305 --> 11:37.139
Let me go!

11:38.206 --> 11:39.441
Hey. Hey!

11:39.474 --> 11:41.376
Someone look at me.
Someone look at me.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.644
Let go of me.

11:42.678 --> 11:43.679
I'm right here!
I'm right here!

11:43.712 --> 11:46.950
I'm not dead. I'm not dead.

11:55.524 --> 11:56.893
You okay?

11:56.926 --> 11:59.361
Let me go. Please let me go.

11:59.394 --> 12:01.263
I want to see him.

12:07.402 --> 12:08.637
No!

12:15.711 --> 12:17.546
No. Where is he?

12:17.579 --> 12:18.814
Lee's with him.

12:19.748 --> 12:20.582
Mom?

12:21.884 --> 12:22.986
No.

12:54.884 --> 12:56.518
- No. No!
- Mom, Mom.

12:57.853 --> 12:59.088
No!

12:59.122 --> 13:01.790
Mom, Mom, Mom.
Get off her! Mom!

13:03.859 --> 13:04.693
Mom! Mom!

13:16.405 --> 13:17.239
Sorry.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.036
Hey.

13:48.770 --> 13:49.604
Hey, hey.

13:50.907 --> 13:53.375
Do you know where
1025 Blount Street is?

13:53.408 --> 13:54.877
I'm late.

13:54.911 --> 13:55.878
Where is it?

13:57.046 --> 13:58.380
Tell me right now.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.715
Come on.

13:59.748 --> 14:01.249
Hey.

14:01.283 --> 14:02.784
Tell me! Tell me now!

14:02.818 --> 14:05.320
It's two blocks
that way, all right.

14:05.353 --> 14:07.522
It's another half mile, now go.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.725
Get your hairy ass
up out of here, bro.

14:13.428 --> 14:15.697
He asks the same
damn thing everyday.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.168
He's a no-brainer.

14:20.203 --> 14:22.604
He don't know he dead.

14:22.637 --> 14:24.706
You know you dead, right?

14:26.075 --> 14:26.909
Yeah.

14:27.843 --> 14:29.011
What was it?

14:30.278 --> 14:31.646
What was it that killed you?

14:33.116 --> 14:34.050
Car, car crash.

14:35.350 --> 14:36.685
Classic.

14:36.718 --> 14:37.652
I love it, yeah.

14:38.888 --> 14:40.355
Well, I'm Jordan.

14:40.388 --> 14:41.757
Chris.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.725
- Oh, just Chris.
- Chris.

14:43.759 --> 14:44.961
All right.

14:44.994 --> 14:46.461
Well, I catch you on
the flip, just Chris.

14:47.829 --> 14:48.663
Hey wait.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.700
Where you going?

14:51.733 --> 14:52.634
I got a lot of
important meetings

14:52.667 --> 14:53.903
with a lot of important people

14:53.936 --> 14:56.338
to talk about a lot
of important things.

14:56.371 --> 14:57.272
I'm just playing, fool.

14:57.305 --> 14:58.908
Nowhere, we dead remember?

15:00.042 --> 15:01.110
How long ago did you-

15:01.144 --> 15:03.079
- October 3, '87.

15:04.247 --> 15:05.680
Yeah fools broke up
into my auntie house.

15:05.714 --> 15:07.449
They was like give me your
stuff, fool. Break your stuff.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.218
And I was like head up, hand up.

15:09.252 --> 15:11.319
You know, but they
got a shot off on me.

15:11.353 --> 15:12.854
I was 17, but it's all good.

15:14.023 --> 15:15.290
30 years ago, you know.

15:15.323 --> 15:16.825
See how old you
was when you died

15:16.858 --> 15:19.162
is how old you stay
when you come here.

15:20.362 --> 15:21.530
So what it really
means is you ain't got

15:21.563 --> 15:24.033
to worry about arthritis
or losing your hair,

15:24.066 --> 15:25.268
or anything else really.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.736
You know, you ain't gonna
get hungry, thirsty,

15:27.769 --> 15:30.106
sleepy, horny,
you're just gonna be.

15:31.073 --> 15:31.908
All right so,

15:32.909 --> 15:33.742
why are we here?

15:35.744 --> 15:37.612
Shouldn't I like
know everything now?

15:39.614 --> 15:41.716
Do you know everything?

15:42.952 --> 15:43.785
No.

15:45.087 --> 15:46.088
Let's bounce, man.

15:52.594 --> 15:55.131
Now you got a good little
spot up here, Chris.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.066
Well, so you're
not from Philly?

15:57.099 --> 15:59.302
Nah, Oaktown you know,
but wandering around there

15:59.334 --> 16:01.870
got old after like the
first five, six years.

16:01.904 --> 16:04.907
So I was like, why not go
somewhere else, you know?

16:04.941 --> 16:05.774
You like that?

16:07.509 --> 16:11.147
There's no like or not like
when you're in this place man.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.882
Those words don't mean anything.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.418
You'll come around.

16:22.124 --> 16:24.626
You left somebody behind, huh?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.296
You got that look in your eye.

16:30.432 --> 16:31.934
Look, I know it hurts now man.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.070
Trust me I do but,

16:35.972 --> 16:37.672
as soon as you
stop giving a damn,

16:38.874 --> 16:41.443
sooner it all gets better.

16:41.476 --> 16:43.279
You'll change your
mind, you will.

16:44.579 --> 16:46.315
Oh you got it all
figured out, huh?

16:47.649 --> 16:49.051
And what you're
still walking for?

16:57.859 --> 17:00.662
So there's a perk or two.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.068
See what I don't
get is why they can't

17:06.102 --> 17:07.270
just like throw it on the
pan for a few minutes.

17:07.303 --> 17:09.071
'Cause that's not
how the Japanese do it.

17:09.105 --> 17:10.739
That's how I do it.

17:10.772 --> 17:11.908
Three dollars for
this, seriously?

17:11.941 --> 17:13.376
Just try it please, for me.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.780
No, it's good.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.751
Okay, I disagree clearly.

17:22.784 --> 17:23.618
All right.

17:25.955 --> 17:29.125
Oh God. Oh God, oh.

17:29.158 --> 17:29.992
I gotta go.

17:31.027 --> 17:31.860
Check please.

18:02.524 --> 18:05.493
Morning Riley.
You feeling better?

18:05.527 --> 18:06.896
Riley this is detective-

18:06.929 --> 18:09.932
- Detective Jenkins with
traffic homicide investigation.

18:09.966 --> 18:11.633
This is just protocol,
they send someone

18:11.666 --> 18:15.637
from THI in whenever, whenever
there's a death involved.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.540
Do you mind?

18:18.573 --> 18:19.408
Go ahead.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.478
Now Riley, I can
appreciate that this

18:23.511 --> 18:25.247
is hard on you and
your family, but

18:26.815 --> 18:28.351
do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

18:29.885 --> 18:32.922
So Riley Jean Stanheight, date
of birth September 6, 1999.

18:32.955 --> 18:34.723
Is that all correct?

18:34.756 --> 18:36.325
You know that car shouldn't
have been on the road.

18:36.359 --> 18:39.761
Were you aware that the
passenger side airbag

18:39.794 --> 18:42.198
was non-functional at the
time of the collision?

18:44.300 --> 18:46.868
Had you been drinking?
Were you distracted?

18:46.902 --> 18:48.170
Anything involved that may have

18:48.204 --> 18:49.939
impaired your
judgment on the road?

18:51.873 --> 18:52.841
No.

18:55.478 --> 18:56.912
Are you sure about that?

18:56.946 --> 18:58.580
I think the answer was
quite clear there detective-

18:58.613 --> 19:00.049
- Is there anything else?

19:00.082 --> 19:02.385
Anything at all that you'd like
to tell me, Ms. Stanheight?

19:02.418 --> 19:03.618
I think we've had

19:03.651 --> 19:04.120
just about enough
stress for the day.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.894
The brake lights.

19:11.927 --> 19:12.761
Riley.

19:13.963 --> 19:17.133
The driver in front of
us, they stopped short.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.201
But there weren't
any brake lights.

19:19.235 --> 19:20.403
Okay.

19:20.436 --> 19:21.270
Thank you.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.210
Yeah, and then he hit
us with another essay

19:28.244 --> 19:31.514
about human sensuality in
1920's Parisian fashion.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.581
I think the man's just
not getting any sex.

19:33.615 --> 19:36.419
You could do everyone a
favor and offer your services.

19:39.021 --> 19:40.523
You guys don't have to stay.

19:41.490 --> 19:42.358
We're not going anywhere.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.430
I tried texting
Chris last night.

19:48.931 --> 19:49.965
Pretty crazy right?

19:52.834 --> 19:53.668
No.

19:56.038 --> 19:57.339
The worst part is is that

19:57.373 --> 19:59.008
I waited for him
to text me back.

20:01.843 --> 20:03.345
You want to hear crazy?

20:03.379 --> 20:05.948
The other night I played both
halves of our Fortnite game,

20:05.981 --> 20:08.451
switching screens like a maniac.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.922
We never could get you
two off of that thing.

20:14.323 --> 20:17.159
Remember that time at the
rink when he forgot his skates,

20:17.193 --> 20:19.261
and he played goalie
in his converse?

20:19.295 --> 20:21.030
They still couldn't
score on him.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.800
In sophomore year
he had this hat.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.471
He loved this hat,
he wore it all year.

20:34.043 --> 20:35.578
What?

20:35.610 --> 20:37.146
Hey. What is it?

20:39.081 --> 20:41.117
These memories, they're Chris.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.551
Okay?

20:42.585 --> 20:44.453
Right, and and, and
they're all that I have left.

20:44.487 --> 20:46.355
And they're gonna fade,
and I'm gonna forget,

20:46.388 --> 20:48.656
and then Chris is gonna
be gone, and then I.

20:48.690 --> 20:51.093
I can't live like that,
I can't live like that.

20:51.127 --> 20:53.028
Okay okay, okay
okay okay. It's okay.

20:54.230 --> 20:55.030
It's okay.

20:56.332 --> 20:57.133
It's okay.

20:59.602 --> 21:01.137
You sure you don't
want us to stay?

21:01.170 --> 21:04.373
Yeah. Bye.

21:45.581 --> 21:46.781
Ry, I wish you could hear me.

21:49.051 --> 21:51.620
You're gonna get through this,
all right. I know you will.

22:13.342 --> 22:15.311
Like I told you,
she's not ready.

22:16.478 --> 22:17.812
And I don't appreciate
another house call.

22:17.845 --> 22:18.981
No I understand,
Mr. Stanheight.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.282
Your daughter's
recovery comes first.

22:20.316 --> 22:22.885
I'm only here to return this.

22:25.054 --> 22:25.888
That's mine.

22:28.657 --> 22:30.858
The records are showing that

22:30.893 --> 22:33.495
you were texting around
the time of the accident.

22:33.529 --> 22:34.530
- I.
- Quiet.

22:36.031 --> 22:36.864
Thank you.

22:38.234 --> 22:39.734
We'll be in touch.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.275
Listen Riley, sweetheart,
we gotta seriously

22:46.308 --> 22:47.809
think about getting
your statement together.

22:47.842 --> 22:49.411
That guy's not going anywhere.

22:49.445 --> 22:51.146
It's gonna be okay.

22:51.180 --> 22:53.781
Let's just go through
it all as you recall it,

22:53.815 --> 22:55.884
what you were doing,
what Chris was doing.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.852
Chris wasn't doing anything.

22:57.886 --> 23:00.055
I was driving, it was my fault.

23:00.089 --> 23:02.324
Well, just consider
everything again.

23:02.358 --> 23:04.026
Make sure it's clear in
your mind, and then we-

23:04.059 --> 23:05.661
- Why are you talking like that?

23:06.861 --> 23:08.297
Like what?

23:08.330 --> 23:10.599
Like how people are going
to see me after this, or

23:11.866 --> 23:13.369
how it affects me.

23:13.402 --> 23:15.738
Of course we are concerned
about how it affects you.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.273
You're our daughter.

23:17.306 --> 23:20.409
And what's Chris, just
another thing to consider?

23:39.762 --> 23:41.230
Look I can't be late for work.

23:41.263 --> 23:42.498
Funerals are expensive.

23:42.531 --> 23:44.266
And his father still
won't return my call

23:44.300 --> 23:46.001
so I'll do everything alone.

23:47.136 --> 23:48.836
I'm sure we could
help with that.

23:52.074 --> 23:54.643
Lee, I was the one
who was driving.

23:54.677 --> 23:56.111
It was my fault.

23:57.279 --> 23:59.948
I just lost the
love of my life, and

24:01.317 --> 24:02.618
Lee I'm so sorry.

24:05.688 --> 24:08.524
Is that what you needed,
getting that off your chest?

24:10.492 --> 24:11.927
I, I don't know Ms. Duncan.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.395
You think that I was
sitting here, waiting for you

24:13.429 --> 24:17.066
to stop by and say sorry
for killing your son?

24:17.099 --> 24:19.535
You think that's what I needed?

24:19.568 --> 24:21.904
No, that's what you needed.

24:21.937 --> 24:23.806
Rich kid, who
thinks all it takes

24:23.838 --> 24:26.075
to make everything
right is, is cash,

24:26.108 --> 24:28.210
and some stupid freaking words.

24:30.379 --> 24:32.314
Don't show your face here again.

25:47.623 --> 25:48.657
Who knew I was so popular?

25:53.262 --> 25:54.863
Looks like my father
had better things to do.

25:57.032 --> 25:59.001
Chris let me
show you something.

25:59.034 --> 26:01.370
Trust me, think of
your favorite place

26:01.403 --> 26:03.105
in the whole world right now.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.275
Do it.

26:12.648 --> 26:15.217
Not my sport, but I respect it.

26:16.652 --> 26:17.986
This is incredible.

26:18.020 --> 26:21.590
Best seat in the house.

26:41.543 --> 26:43.178
So what happened?

26:43.212 --> 26:44.279
Oh, rookie mistake.

26:45.614 --> 26:47.049
You probably started thinking
about something else.

26:47.082 --> 26:49.651
Yeah, you gotta watch
them stray feelings, boy.

26:49.685 --> 26:51.620
Or who knows where
you'll end up.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.754
Your mind can just randomly

26:52.788 --> 26:54.323
take you places
whenever it feels like?

26:54.356 --> 26:55.791
I mean your mind, sure.

26:55.824 --> 26:58.594
But I mastered this
teleportation stuff years ago.

26:59.896 --> 27:02.531
Dirty ass place.
Where we at, bro?

27:19.848 --> 27:21.383
This was a mistake.

27:21.416 --> 27:22.317
What?

27:22.351 --> 27:23.953
Hey? Hey, hold up.

28:20.542 --> 28:21.643
You look good, baby.

28:23.712 --> 28:24.546
Only good?

28:32.287 --> 28:34.756
I don't know why
I'm so surprised.

28:34.790 --> 28:39.795
I hear your voice every
day, everywhere I go.

28:40.662 --> 28:42.831
I'm sorry that I'm so weak but,

28:44.266 --> 28:47.971
pretending that you're not
gone feels really great.

28:48.004 --> 28:48.837
Only great?

29:33.016 --> 29:33.849
Amazing.

29:35.517 --> 29:36.451
Perfect.

29:39.889 --> 29:40.722
Chris?

29:45.494 --> 29:46.328
Chris?

29:48.864 --> 29:49.698
Chris?

30:27.469 --> 30:28.670
Dude, I am telling you.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.106
I'm telling you
she could hear me.

30:30.139 --> 30:33.341
I've been here 30
years, bro, 30 long years.

30:33.375 --> 30:35.377
And I ain't never heard
of nothing like this.

30:35.410 --> 30:38.181
The one absolute rule of being
dead is we can't communicate-

30:38.213 --> 30:40.482
- With the living.
You're wrong though.

30:40.515 --> 30:41.884
I'm wrong?

30:41.918 --> 30:43.920
Oh, you got it all figured out.

30:43.953 --> 30:45.320
Okay, prove it.

30:55.397 --> 30:58.034
I know Nate better than
anyone, all right trust me.

30:58.067 --> 30:59.902
Your boy looks like hell.

31:02.704 --> 31:03.538
Yeah he does.

31:05.942 --> 31:07.843
Well, we doing this or what?

31:07.877 --> 31:08.677
Sorry.

31:08.710 --> 31:09.544
Damn.

31:16.318 --> 31:17.153
Nate.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.824
Nate, it's Chris.

31:24.826 --> 31:25.627
Nate!

31:30.133 --> 31:30.967
Nate?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.501
Why would I lie?

31:32.534 --> 31:33.702
Oh my God, you tell me.

31:33.735 --> 31:34.937
I don't know you.

31:34.971 --> 31:36.939
Okay listen, for the
sake of argument,

31:36.973 --> 31:38.807
let's say you was being
straight up with me,

31:38.840 --> 31:40.042
that you talked to her-

31:40.076 --> 31:40.877
- Which I did.

31:40.910 --> 31:42.444
Which you did, yeah.

31:42.477 --> 31:46.281
Look, maybe it's some, I don't
know, special power you have.

31:46.314 --> 31:49.018
And maybe you're supposed
to use it to do something.

31:49.051 --> 31:50.920
Right, well like what?

31:50.953 --> 31:52.188
Look there's only one thing

31:52.221 --> 31:54.723
anybody's ever trying
to do here, move on.

31:54.756 --> 31:56.458
Like I said, most folks skip.

32:01.797 --> 32:02.899
Why didn't you skip?

32:05.201 --> 32:08.104
What if it only works
with your girl, you dig?

32:08.137 --> 32:11.773
Like, what if it's just some
connection only y'all had?

32:21.416 --> 32:23.752
You know we don't have to
do this if you don't want to.

32:23.785 --> 32:24.853
No, I want to.

32:26.855 --> 32:27.689
How's Nate?

32:29.258 --> 32:32.028
Texting me awkward stuff
in the middle of the night,

32:32.061 --> 32:34.964
skipping out on stuff,
getting mad for no reason.

32:34.997 --> 32:36.364
It's super weird.

32:36.398 --> 32:37.233
Hey.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.402
Have you ever
experienced something

32:40.435 --> 32:42.205
that like you couldn't explain?

32:42.238 --> 32:44.240
Like, I don't know like
you heard something,

32:44.273 --> 32:47.276
and then you were like,
I heard something.

32:47.310 --> 32:50.046
And then you look around
and nothing's there.

32:50.079 --> 32:51.247
You're hearing things?

32:53.515 --> 32:54.951
No.

32:54.984 --> 32:55.784
No.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.485
Never mind.

32:58.486 --> 32:59.454
Okay.

32:59.487 --> 33:01.123
Sushi tomorrow night?

33:01.157 --> 33:03.692
Me, you, and Nate
if I can get him?

33:03.725 --> 33:04.793
Yeah, I can dig it?

33:07.129 --> 33:07.964
What?

33:09.431 --> 33:11.968
Nothing, I've just never
heard you say that before.

33:12.001 --> 33:12.902
It was always Chris's thing.

33:15.503 --> 33:17.206
Oh, I guess it
just slipped out.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.323
That's Chris's number.

33:36.259 --> 33:38.094
He's wearing Chris's
number, right?

33:38.127 --> 33:40.662
Yeah, he wanted to as tribute.

33:52.841 --> 33:53.943
You okay?

33:53.976 --> 33:54.776
You okay?

33:54.809 --> 33:55.610
Yeah.

34:17.133 --> 34:19.634
Okay, let's take a breather.

34:41.223 --> 34:42.058
Chris?

34:54.569 --> 34:57.306
No. Absolutely not.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.075
It's the truth, that's
what you guys wanted.

34:59.108 --> 35:01.210
You were not texting at
the time of the accident.

35:01.243 --> 35:02.111
Yes I was.

35:02.144 --> 35:03.578
No, you were not.

35:03.611 --> 35:06.015
Because if you were, it's
no longer an accident.

35:06.048 --> 35:07.416
It becomes a felony.

35:07.450 --> 35:09.718
You do understand
what happens, right?

35:09.751 --> 35:12.421
After a felony indictment,
let alone a conviction?

35:12.455 --> 35:15.024
Do you want to
destroy your future?

35:15.057 --> 35:17.193
There it is. I knew
that this was coming.

35:17.226 --> 35:19.861
That's all you two care about
is future, future, future.

35:19.895 --> 35:21.330
With good reason.

35:21.364 --> 35:23.265
There's no returning from
a statement like this.

35:23.299 --> 35:25.267
It's the same as handing
in a guilty plea.

35:25.301 --> 35:27.635
Well guess what? I am guilty.

35:28.938 --> 35:30.839
It's as simple as that.

35:32.008 --> 35:33.242
Young lady come
back here right now.

36:03.973 --> 36:08.978
21% report hearing them,
3% feeling their touch.

36:10.413 --> 36:12.614
Losing my father was

36:12.647 --> 36:14.616
probably the hardest
thing I've ever had to-

36:14.649 --> 36:17.186
- And some people say that
ones that have passed on,

36:17.219 --> 36:19.721
that they're actually
coming to say hello.

36:19.754 --> 36:21.090
They're visiting with you and-

36:21.123 --> 36:22.857
- And she could feel her mother

36:22.892 --> 36:24.559
standing at the foot of her bed.

36:24.592 --> 36:28.998
An hour after he passed,
I got a message on my phone.

36:29.031 --> 36:30.665
It was crazy.

36:38.573 --> 36:40.176
- Oh hey.
- Hey hey.

36:44.547 --> 36:45.981
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

37:40.302 --> 37:41.203
Hey.

38:02.224 --> 38:04.326
What the heck am I doing?

38:09.797 --> 38:10.633
Damn it!

39:05.020 --> 39:05.853
Go home.

39:07.223 --> 39:08.490
I'm going home.

39:13.329 --> 39:14.163
Chris?

39:19.602 --> 39:20.502
Chris?

39:20.536 --> 39:22.638
Close your eyes.

39:48.731 --> 39:51.133
Oh my God, I can feel
you. I can really feel you.

39:53.868 --> 39:55.004
It wasn't your fault
Ry, it was an accident.

39:55.037 --> 39:56.272
You can't blame yourself.

39:58.073 --> 40:00.676
Of course, my imagination
would make you say that.

40:02.945 --> 40:04.713
I've been reading
up about grief.

40:04.747 --> 40:07.283
And I know that this is
all just in my imagination.

40:08.783 --> 40:10.452
What, you think this
is all in your head?

40:11.853 --> 40:14.290
It's my mind's way of
coping with you being gone.

40:17.159 --> 40:18.761
I'm gonna tell you something
you couldn't possibly know.

40:21.397 --> 40:23.999
My dad got me a watch
just before he left,

40:24.033 --> 40:26.201
and I was so pissed
that I buried it

40:28.170 --> 40:30.105
in my backyard by the shed.

40:30.139 --> 40:31.307
Find it for me, okay.

40:34.043 --> 40:35.344
Promise me you'll find it.

40:36.478 --> 40:37.279
I promise.

40:38.914 --> 40:40.382
Hello?

40:44.720 --> 40:49.692
Is everything all right?

41:06.408 --> 41:07.743
Riley?

41:10.079 --> 41:10.913
Riley?

41:11.846 --> 41:13.382
Yeah, coming Mom.

41:28.097 --> 41:28.931
Okay.

41:30.666 --> 41:31.500
Thank you.

42:58.053 --> 42:59.455
What's going on, honey?

42:59.488 --> 43:01.557
Is this all we
have of my stuff?

43:03.392 --> 43:04.993
Maybe, I think there
might be another box

43:05.027 --> 43:07.196
in the storage unit someplace.

43:07.229 --> 43:08.797
Why, do you need
them for something?

43:09.665 --> 43:11.033
Do you remember this one?

43:12.468 --> 43:14.403
I made it for your 40th?

43:14.436 --> 43:17.907
Yes, Blue Rider,
about the girl who

43:17.941 --> 43:19.741
took her horse into the city.

43:20.910 --> 43:22.144
Did you like it?

43:22.177 --> 43:23.479
Of course I did.

43:24.580 --> 43:26.048
What did you like about it?

43:27.182 --> 43:30.752
I love how much
work you put into it.

43:30.786 --> 43:32.521
I think it's beautiful.

43:32.554 --> 43:34.924
It's detailed.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.391
But do you think it's good?

43:37.793 --> 43:39.294
I think lots of people,

43:39.328 --> 43:43.065
lots of artists are
very good, even great.

43:43.098 --> 43:44.833
But only one or two out of 100

43:44.867 --> 43:45.868
get to succeed at something-

43:45.902 --> 43:47.803
- Yeah, I got it Mom, thanks.

43:54.510 --> 43:57.779
You are my daughter,
and I love you.

43:58.982 --> 44:00.349
I just want you
to be successful.

44:00.382 --> 44:03.652
But do you think
they're good? Do you?

44:04.954 --> 44:06.154
Do you think I'm good?

44:10.425 --> 44:12.427
I think you are
better than good.

44:13.562 --> 44:15.063
I think you are incredible.

44:27.676 --> 44:28.878
Okay, it's that
crab thing you like,

44:28.912 --> 44:30.846
with the actual crab,
not with the fake stuff.

44:32.714 --> 44:34.483
You guys up for
some sake bombs?

44:34.516 --> 44:36.451
Nate. No.

44:36.485 --> 44:37.987
Come on.

44:38.021 --> 44:40.924
I don't know when you
became such a prude, Jules.

44:40.957 --> 44:41.757
It's like you're
not even thinking.

44:41.790 --> 44:43.492
Boo, boo.

44:43.525 --> 44:44.359
Stop it.

44:46.361 --> 44:48.063
Oh my God. Are
you already drunk?

44:48.096 --> 44:50.033
Just pre-gamed a little.

44:50.098 --> 44:51.366
It's all good in the hood.

44:53.402 --> 44:55.103
By the way, Riley.

44:57.306 --> 44:58.874
Heard the cops have
been up your ass.

44:59.741 --> 45:00.842
Where'd you hear that?

45:01.710 --> 45:04.646
Around. Does it matter?

45:04.680 --> 45:05.814
So what, they think you were

45:05.847 --> 45:07.749
driving like a
maniac or something?

45:07.783 --> 45:09.751
- Jesus, Nate.
- My driving was fine.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.923
Except you crashed my car.

45:13.957 --> 45:16.658
So it wasn't that
fine, am I right?

45:16.692 --> 45:17.593
Let it go.

45:17.626 --> 45:19.861
Two shots, two hours ago.

45:19.896 --> 45:20.930
That's what you said.

45:22.031 --> 45:23.498
Most of the night's
still a blur,

45:23.532 --> 45:25.300
but that's coming through
crystal clear you know.

45:25.334 --> 45:26.702
It sounds like you
think that I was lying.

45:26.735 --> 45:27.569
Were you?

45:30.772 --> 45:31.573
Yeah.

45:33.775 --> 45:34.843
Freaking called it.

45:35.777 --> 45:36.812
But not about that.

45:37.914 --> 45:40.449
Your car, that you're
too lazy to fix,

45:40.482 --> 45:41.985
that shouldn't be on the road,

45:43.418 --> 45:45.153
that's what happened.

45:45.187 --> 45:46.355
And I lied.

45:46.388 --> 45:47.789
I lied to protect you.

45:47.823 --> 45:51.094
I lied to protect your
life, to protect my friend.

46:02.704 --> 46:04.007
Something wrong?

46:06.075 --> 46:08.543
I just don't like the taste.

46:13.983 --> 46:15.051
We also have pizza?

46:19.221 --> 46:20.489
That's gross.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.063
Hey, how was-

46:27.096 --> 46:27.930
- Great.

46:36.471 --> 46:37.272
What are you doing?

46:37.305 --> 46:38.473
Soul searching.

47:26.254 --> 47:27.856
This is ridiculous.

49:54.870 --> 49:55.770
Can you kiss me?

49:58.307 --> 49:59.741
Let's find out.

50:12.121 --> 50:13.588
This is real.

50:13.622 --> 50:15.291
I'm not making this up.

50:15.324 --> 50:16.491
It's not in my mind.

50:16.524 --> 50:17.994
I don't know what this means.

50:19.295 --> 50:20.096
How?

50:22.164 --> 50:25.167
I died, I kind of got stuck.

50:25.201 --> 50:27.702
Everything else, I don't know.

50:30.039 --> 50:30.940
You believe this?

50:30.973 --> 50:32.308
Yeah.

50:32.341 --> 50:34.176
That doesn't matter?

50:43.652 --> 50:46.055
Hey. Who's out there?

50:47.489 --> 50:48.291
Hey.

50:52.261 --> 50:53.062
Riley?

51:16.218 --> 51:18.553
Riley, can you come
down to the kitchen please?

51:30.598 --> 51:32.935
Please have a seat, Riley.

51:37.772 --> 51:39.474
Mrs. Douglas has
informed us that last night

51:39.507 --> 51:40.842
she caught you trespassing
on her property-

51:40.876 --> 51:42.211
- Digging in my damn yard.

51:43.812 --> 51:44.612
Is that true?

51:46.581 --> 51:47.383
Yes.

51:49.352 --> 51:51.287
But I wasn't trying to
trespass or anything.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.687
What were you doing there?

51:54.589 --> 51:56.058
I was looking for something.

51:57.492 --> 51:58.294
A watch.

51:59.794 --> 52:01.230
You stole a watch?

52:03.565 --> 52:05.067
It's hard to explain.

52:05.101 --> 52:05.935
Try.

52:10.572 --> 52:11.606
Chris told me to.

52:15.411 --> 52:20.216
Before my son died, he told
you to go root around my shed?

52:20.249 --> 52:21.683
Hold on, Riley-

52:21.716 --> 52:23.119
- No, I mean you didn't think
it was enough to kill him.

52:23.152 --> 52:25.221
You had to come
lift his stuff too?

52:25.254 --> 52:26.688
Lee.

52:26.721 --> 52:27.923
Jesus, that's what you
two do for a living, right?

52:27.957 --> 52:29.225
Protect the guilty,
get rich doing it?

52:29.258 --> 52:30.692
Excuse me?

52:30.725 --> 52:32.194
That's how you keep your
murderer daughter out of jail.

52:32.228 --> 52:33.229
Listen to me, Lee.

52:35.064 --> 52:36.232
I know you're hurting.

52:36.265 --> 52:37.500
I know what you're
going through.

52:37.565 --> 52:39.235
But you're in the
wrong to come here

52:39.268 --> 52:41.137
and call my daughter a murderer.

52:42.338 --> 52:44.206
You're wrong to blame
her, and you know it.

52:58.320 --> 53:01.457
I don't care about
the watch. Keep it.

53:03.658 --> 53:04.493
But,

53:06.128 --> 53:07.862
listen to me Riley.

53:07.897 --> 53:09.331
I can't see you because

53:11.067 --> 53:14.602
when I see your face, I
see Chris, I see my boy.

53:15.637 --> 53:16.838
I don't know what to do.

53:39.594 --> 53:41.297
Riley?

53:41.330 --> 53:43.466
Hey? What is this music?

53:45.234 --> 53:46.335
Speaker volume 10.

54:01.749 --> 54:03.185
Well my question is,

54:03.219 --> 54:06.422
why do you always connect
with her when I'm not around?

54:07.789 --> 54:09.024
No right,
because when I'm with her

54:09.058 --> 54:11.961
I'm thinking about
you, sure, right.

54:11.994 --> 54:13.562
Well there's
always next time.

54:16.664 --> 54:18.334
So this thing is legit?

54:20.536 --> 54:21.370
That's what I've
been telling you.

54:24.672 --> 54:26.808
Hey, you gonna
show me how it works?

54:26.841 --> 54:28.743
What do you need it for?

54:28.776 --> 54:29.612
I thought you didn't give a
shit about anyone anymore.

54:29.644 --> 54:30.479
I don't.

54:36.851 --> 54:38.254
So you gonna show me or not?

54:40.055 --> 54:43.392
How it works for us is,
you need something you share,

54:43.425 --> 54:45.528
like a memory, or
a strong emotion.

54:47.196 --> 54:49.331
For us it's Riley's drawing.

54:49.365 --> 54:50.499
Hey, what time is it?

54:51.733 --> 54:53.035
It's seven I think. Why?

54:58.641 --> 55:01.277
She used to play this for
me every day after dinner.

55:02.777 --> 55:05.948
Every day, right
around seven o'clock.

55:07.049 --> 55:08.651
It's really nice.

55:08.683 --> 55:09.518
Maybe that's it?

55:58.167 --> 55:59.501
Hey Dad.

55:59.535 --> 56:00.835
I'm doing great by the way.

56:01.836 --> 56:03.038
I'm dead, if you forgot.

56:05.407 --> 56:07.343
Hey, did you see any
polar bears in Alaska?

56:08.344 --> 56:09.178
No?

56:10.346 --> 56:12.114
Weird. That's where
Mom told us you went.

56:13.549 --> 56:14.383
And I get why.

56:15.484 --> 56:16.952
It's easier than telling
your abandoned son

56:16.986 --> 56:19.821
that his dad was in the same
freaking state the whole time!

56:25.227 --> 56:27.129
Joke's on me, huh?

56:39.774 --> 56:40.775
Did it work?

56:45.347 --> 56:46.181
And?

56:51.320 --> 56:52.154
Chris man,

56:53.522 --> 56:55.758
you need to focus on getting
out of here all right.

56:55.790 --> 56:57.626
Like I said, most
folks just skip.

56:58.494 --> 56:59.995
What?

57:00.029 --> 57:00.896
She's alive man.

57:00.929 --> 57:02.131
You're not.

57:02.164 --> 57:03.365
She'll eventually move on,

57:03.399 --> 57:04.900
and then you gonna
have to face yourself.

57:04.933 --> 57:06.068
Face yourself?

57:06.969 --> 57:08.404
Are you kidding me?

57:08.437 --> 57:09.638
Or maybe you're just
jealous of what I have?

57:09.672 --> 57:10.838
We're not talking
about me, man.

57:10.872 --> 57:12.775
We're talking about
you, all right.

57:12.807 --> 57:14.443
Well, what's holding
you back, Jordan?

57:14.476 --> 57:15.944
'Cause I'm not the one
that's been stuck here

57:15.978 --> 57:18.714
for 30 years doing the same
over and over and over again.

57:18.747 --> 57:20.416
Who the hell do
you think you are?

57:21.750 --> 57:23.085
I'll tell you who you are.

57:23.118 --> 57:24.386
You're some nobody kid who got

57:24.420 --> 57:26.989
lucky enough to run
into me, all right.

57:27.022 --> 57:30.492
I didn't have to show you the
ropes around here but I did.

57:30.526 --> 57:33.495
After everything, you
gonna come to me like this?

57:33.529 --> 57:34.363
I'm out.

58:03.125 --> 58:05.860
So what you want to
do is grab the knife

58:05.894 --> 58:08.731
with your hand like that.

58:08.764 --> 58:10.766
Fingertips, on your knuckles.

58:10.799 --> 58:12.000
Yeah?

58:12.034 --> 58:13.802
Right up against
that like that.

58:13.836 --> 58:14.903
Okay.

58:14.937 --> 58:16.572
And slice.

58:20.042 --> 58:21.210
There we go.

58:22.311 --> 58:24.079
How's that feel?

58:24.113 --> 58:25.914
I think I'm gonna
be a TV dinner girl.

58:25.948 --> 58:26.815
No, you're not.

58:28.317 --> 58:30.552
You call yourself an
adult, but you can't cook?

58:30.586 --> 58:31.754
All righty.

58:38.494 --> 58:39.962
I could definitely do this.

59:06.021 --> 59:06.822
Jules?

59:08.023 --> 59:10.492
Wait, slow down slow
down. Where are you?

59:12.561 --> 59:14.898
Okay. Okay okay, I'm coming.

59:26.975 --> 59:28.110
You don't need to
go to the cops.

59:28.143 --> 59:29.645
No, I have to.

59:29.678 --> 59:31.380
They need to know what I did.

59:31.413 --> 59:32.848
They need to know it was me.

59:33.749 --> 59:34.650
Nate.

59:34.683 --> 59:35.851
You said it yourself, Ry.

59:35.885 --> 59:37.186
I should have
gotten my car fixed.

59:37.219 --> 59:38.420
So what, you're
gonna walk in and say

59:38.454 --> 59:40.689
hey here's the deal, my
bad, throw me in jail?

59:40.722 --> 59:42.057
Pretty much.

59:42.090 --> 59:43.358
I fucked up, right?

59:43.392 --> 59:44.460
It's time to face it.

59:45.327 --> 59:46.094
This isn't gonna help anyone.

59:46.128 --> 59:46.962
It'll help me.

59:48.430 --> 59:50.766
I'm losing my mind over this.

59:57.039 --> 59:59.341
This isn't what Chris
would have wanted.

59:59.374 --> 1:00:00.175
Oh yeah?

1:00:01.310 --> 1:00:03.278
How do you know what
Chris would have wanted?

1:00:15.157 --> 1:00:16.458
Come on.

1:00:16.492 --> 1:00:17.392
I want to show you
guys something.

1:00:27.436 --> 1:00:29.471
Ry, are
you sure about this?

1:00:29.505 --> 1:00:31.139
What are we doing?

1:00:31.173 --> 1:00:32.608
Seeing Chris.

1:00:32.641 --> 1:00:33.475
What?

1:00:34.443 --> 1:00:37.713
Look, if this doesn't work,

1:00:38.882 --> 1:00:40.249
I'll go to therapy
and I'll admit

1:00:40.282 --> 1:00:42.017
that it's just grieving, okay.

1:00:45.487 --> 1:00:46.288
I'm in.

1:00:52.127 --> 1:00:53.128
Trust me, Jules.

1:01:15.417 --> 1:01:17.119
How do you know
he's gonna come?

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:19.388
He'll come.

1:01:51.553 --> 1:01:53.855
Is something gonna happen?

1:01:55.591 --> 1:01:56.391
What?

1:01:57.826 --> 1:02:01.396
I guess I thought that
something was gonna happen.

1:02:01.430 --> 1:02:03.632
He's here. He's right here.

1:02:05.133 --> 1:02:05.935
Who is?

1:02:07.636 --> 1:02:08.503
Chris!

1:02:14.010 --> 1:02:15.878
They can't see me.

1:02:15.912 --> 1:02:18.047
No, but they have
to. This has to work.

1:02:18.081 --> 1:02:20.049
Ry, I don't think
this is good for you.

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:21.249
Tell me something about Nate,

1:02:21.283 --> 1:02:23.052
something that only
you would know.

1:02:24.988 --> 1:02:26.221
Ry,
maybe we shouldn't.

1:02:26.254 --> 1:02:27.522
They have to understand.

1:02:27.556 --> 1:02:29.191
We have to go.

1:02:29.224 --> 1:02:30.292
This has to stop.

1:02:33.362 --> 1:02:34.463
Julia don't. Don't!

1:02:34.496 --> 1:02:35.330
He's dead.

1:02:38.567 --> 1:02:39.701
You need help.

1:02:40.903 --> 1:02:43.106
You need to live your life.

1:02:43.138 --> 1:02:44.941
This is my life.

1:02:44.974 --> 1:02:46.109
Have you looked
at yourself lately?

1:02:47.309 --> 1:02:48.810
This isn't good for you, Ry.

1:02:51.213 --> 1:02:52.814
I love you, you're
my best friend but,

1:02:54.616 --> 1:02:56.218
I can't watch you
do this to yourself.

1:02:57.586 --> 1:02:59.254
So until you get help.

1:02:59.287 --> 1:03:00.089
Jules.

1:03:01.891 --> 1:03:02.724
Julia?

1:03:27.984 --> 1:03:29.718
You knew, you freaking knew.

1:03:29.751 --> 1:03:32.454
You chill. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:03:32.487 --> 1:03:34.090
Where are we?

1:03:34.123 --> 1:03:35.524
This is where it happened.

1:03:41.697 --> 1:03:44.599
Auntie brought my niece, Alicia,
to the Christmas village.

1:03:46.002 --> 1:03:48.203
I tagged along. She
was turning five.

1:03:50.672 --> 1:03:52.909
Auntie went to get
us hot chocolate,

1:03:52.942 --> 1:03:54.077
she told me to
look after Alicia.

1:03:56.411 --> 1:03:59.247
She wanted to go play, I
told her not to go too far.

1:04:06.521 --> 1:04:08.690
I wasn't paying attention,

1:04:11.493 --> 1:04:12.661
and I lost her.

1:04:27.009 --> 1:04:30.046
Jordan, that must
have been awful but,

1:04:30.079 --> 1:04:31.480
I don't understand what
that has to do with-

1:04:31.513 --> 1:04:32.414
- You will.

1:05:08.184 --> 1:05:09.451
She was fine.

1:05:09.484 --> 1:05:11.053
Then she got sicker and sicker.

1:05:15.057 --> 1:05:17.425
And I ain't put it together
until it was too late.

1:05:19.228 --> 1:05:21.530
But it was me,
connecting with her.

1:05:24.866 --> 1:05:25.834
And now she's dead,

1:05:26.868 --> 1:05:27.702
thanks to you.

1:05:33.976 --> 1:05:35.144
Is she here?

1:05:37.146 --> 1:05:38.413
She skipped this level.

1:05:41.284 --> 1:05:42.551
Look, it ain't free.

1:05:42.584 --> 1:05:43.485
This connection?

1:05:44.686 --> 1:05:46.521
Somebody got to pay
the price for it,

1:05:47.422 --> 1:05:48.291
with life.

1:05:49.457 --> 1:05:50.893
But we ain't got no
more life to give,

1:05:50.927 --> 1:05:52.527
so it gotta come from somewhere.

1:05:56.665 --> 1:05:59.668
Well, my auntie didn't have
many more years left anyway.

1:06:00.869 --> 1:06:02.838
So I guess it only
took a few visits.

1:06:05.308 --> 1:06:07.843
But if you keep it
up with your girl,

1:06:08.878 --> 1:06:10.146
it's gonna end the same way.

1:06:21.257 --> 1:06:22.557
So here comes the truth.

1:06:25.962 --> 1:06:28.430
There was no break-in,
no fight, no shot.

1:06:33.069 --> 1:06:35.238
I didn't save my auntie.

1:06:35.271 --> 1:06:37.505
After I heard they
found Alicia's body I,

1:06:38.506 --> 1:06:41.177
I came home, took out my belt.

1:06:45.513 --> 1:06:46.815
Jordan.

1:06:46.848 --> 1:06:47.849
Auntie found me.

1:06:47.884 --> 1:06:49.252
She never really recovered.

1:06:51.187 --> 1:06:53.322
You know maybe seeing
me one more time

1:06:53.356 --> 1:06:55.157
before she died was
what she needed.

1:06:56.491 --> 1:06:57.994
But you gotta stop, man.

1:06:59.461 --> 1:07:01.596
Your girl's got her
whole life ahead of her.

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:07.136
It's not yours to take away.

1:07:47.475 --> 1:07:48.311
Hey you.

1:07:52.381 --> 1:07:53.481
Ry, we need to talk.

1:08:03.625 --> 1:08:04.427
Don't go.

1:08:06.896 --> 1:08:08.030
You're gonna say
that you have to go,

1:08:08.064 --> 1:08:09.432
and I'm telling you not to.

1:08:11.866 --> 1:08:13.568
I didn't realize it before but

1:08:14.736 --> 1:08:17.006
every time you visit
me it changes me.

1:08:18.174 --> 1:08:20.076
No no, I mean the
things that you say,

1:08:20.109 --> 1:08:21.576
that you like, that
you don't like,

1:08:21.609 --> 1:08:24.013
they're becoming things that
I say, things that I like.

1:08:26.614 --> 1:08:29.919
So maybe this means that
this is just the beginning.

1:08:29.952 --> 1:08:33.422
Maybe we can bring you back
or something, maybe we can.

1:08:35.057 --> 1:08:38.127
This is making you sicker and
sicker, Ry. We have to stop.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.862
No, you don't get to decide
that. I'm not losing you.

1:08:40.896 --> 1:08:42.564
I'm killing you.

1:08:42.597 --> 1:08:45.301
When I said that I wanted
to let you go I was wrong.

1:08:46.501 --> 1:08:47.702
I don't want to.

1:08:47.736 --> 1:08:48.803
Those little bits
that I left with you,

1:08:48.837 --> 1:08:50.339
they're always gonna be there.

1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:52.707
I thought that
you wanted this.

1:08:52.741 --> 1:08:54.343
I thought that you
wanted us to be together.

1:08:54.377 --> 1:08:55.378
Of course I do.

1:08:55.411 --> 1:08:56.578
Then don't leave.

1:08:56.611 --> 1:08:58.180
Come here.

1:09:19.368 --> 1:09:20.302
- I have to go.
- No.

1:09:20.336 --> 1:09:21.404
- I have to go.
- No, no, no!

1:09:21.437 --> 1:09:22.537
I love you.

1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:26.375
Chris?

1:09:29.145 --> 1:09:30.545
No!

1:09:30.578 --> 1:09:31.480
Stay Chris!

1:09:47.229 --> 1:09:48.064
Hey.

1:09:49.532 --> 1:09:50.366
Hey.

1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:00.176
Honey, I really
think we should make

1:10:00.209 --> 1:10:01.576
a doctor's appointment
for you, something's not...

1:10:01.609 --> 1:10:02.545
I'm fine.

1:10:02.577 --> 1:10:04.246
- No but-
- I'm fine.

1:10:45.753 --> 1:10:49.191
I don't know, I guess
I thought that'd be it.

1:10:49.225 --> 1:10:51.793
That that was the
thing keeping me here.

1:10:51.826 --> 1:10:53.395
I'd let her go, and I'd move on.

1:10:55.531 --> 1:10:58.100
Saying it and meaning it
are two different things.

1:11:00.069 --> 1:11:01.504
Hey.

1:11:01.537 --> 1:11:02.972
The detective was just telling
us about a new development

1:11:03.005 --> 1:11:04.806
in your case that we thought
you might want to hear.

1:11:05.773 --> 1:11:06.876
I did mean it.

1:11:06.909 --> 1:11:07.742
Really?

1:11:09.245 --> 1:11:10.712
Let me ask you a question.

1:11:10.745 --> 1:11:11.947
Would you still have
said goodbye if you knew

1:11:11.981 --> 1:11:14.450
your visits weren't
costing her her life?

1:11:14.483 --> 1:11:16.252
So the driver of the
car that you rear-ended,

1:11:16.285 --> 1:11:18.786
we've learned that nine
days before your accident

1:11:18.820 --> 1:11:22.124
he was given a ticket in Texas
for a faulty brake light.

1:11:22.158 --> 1:11:23.492
Now so far, he's been unable

1:11:23.526 --> 1:11:25.361
to prove that he
fixed the brake light.

1:11:25.394 --> 1:11:27.229
So if he still can't
come up with this proof,

1:11:27.263 --> 1:11:28.663
all things being equal,

1:11:28.696 --> 1:11:30.966
I think we'll be able
to close this case.

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.635
If you could see her
as much as you wanted,

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.470
no problems, nothing
bad happened after,

1:11:34.503 --> 1:11:38.040
if that was the way it was,
would you still leave her alone?

1:11:39.241 --> 1:11:41.177
Thank you, detective,
genuinely thank you.

1:11:41.210 --> 1:11:43.245
Hey, just doing my job.

1:11:43.279 --> 1:11:44.580
You drive safe, all right.

1:11:52.820 --> 1:11:55.524
Well of course I'd stay with
her for as long as I could.

1:11:55.558 --> 1:11:57.526
You're not still here
'cause of her man.

1:11:59.328 --> 1:12:00.695
You still here 'cause of you.

1:12:18.614 --> 1:12:19.814
Not gonna forgive you.

1:12:20.883 --> 1:12:22.051
Not gonna get that from me,

1:12:22.084 --> 1:12:24.553
if that's what
you're hoping for.

1:12:24.587 --> 1:12:27.089
I wasted so much of my
life thinking about you.

1:12:29.491 --> 1:12:30.326
I'm done now.

1:12:34.496 --> 1:12:36.131
I hope you have
a good life, Dad.

1:12:37.967 --> 1:12:39.501
I'm not kidding, I hope you do.

1:12:41.570 --> 1:12:42.938
That little boy looks
like he really loves you.

1:12:44.907 --> 1:12:47.142
Maybe think of sticking
around this time, huh?

1:12:49.278 --> 1:12:50.112
Dad?

1:13:07.429 --> 1:13:08.264
Riley.

1:13:09.164 --> 1:13:10.966
What are you doing here?

1:13:12.935 --> 1:13:13.868
He stopped coming.

1:13:13.902 --> 1:13:15.104
Chris, he stop coming.

1:13:17.406 --> 1:13:18.240
That's good.

1:13:22.911 --> 1:13:25.247
Is that all you came here
for, to tell me that?

1:13:30.519 --> 1:13:31.387
No, I...

1:13:33.922 --> 1:13:35.424
Thank you for being my friend.

1:13:37.859 --> 1:13:39.028
And tell Nate that too.

1:13:39.995 --> 1:13:41.764
Wait. Riley?

1:15:32.775 --> 1:15:33.776
She's not with Julie either.

1:15:34.943 --> 1:15:36.678
We can
track her phone.

1:17:00.028 --> 1:17:01.296
Riley!

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.082
You came back to me.

1:17:20.115 --> 1:17:23.452
You came to me Riley,
you shouldn't be here.

1:17:54.416 --> 1:17:56.818
There had to be another
way for us to be together.

1:17:58.253 --> 1:17:59.488
And this is it.

1:18:01.089 --> 1:18:01.925
No, Ry.

1:18:04.426 --> 1:18:06.194
Let me go with you.

1:18:07.296 --> 1:18:08.830
I found my Dad, Ry.

1:18:11.733 --> 1:18:13.135
I told myself ever
since I was a kid

1:18:13.168 --> 1:18:14.938
that I would never
do what he did,

1:18:16.138 --> 1:18:17.639
I would never abandon
the people I love.

1:18:20.309 --> 1:18:21.810
I was so scared that I
couldn't see the truth.

1:18:22.946 --> 1:18:24.013
What truth?

1:18:28.051 --> 1:18:28.885
We have to move on.

1:18:30.686 --> 1:18:33.355
And I know it's gonna hurt.

1:18:33.388 --> 1:18:35.757
I know it's gonna hurt,
but you're gonna be okay.

1:18:35.791 --> 1:18:36.993
No.

1:18:37.026 --> 1:18:38.493
No, not just okay,
you're gonna be great.

1:18:40.964 --> 1:18:41.797
You're gonna be amazing.

1:18:44.766 --> 1:18:46.201
Wherever your life takes you,

1:18:48.203 --> 1:18:49.072
it'll be perfect.

1:18:57.179 --> 1:18:58.313
You gotta live for me, Ry.

1:18:58.347 --> 1:18:59.548
No.

1:18:59.581 --> 1:19:00.616
You have to be, you
have to live for me, Ry.

1:19:01.918 --> 1:19:02.952
You have to live, Ry.

1:19:04.419 --> 1:19:05.821
Breathe for me, live for me.

1:19:07.489 --> 1:19:08.690
I have to move on.

1:19:08.724 --> 1:19:09.558
You have to live.

1:19:11.259 --> 1:19:12.527
Breathe Ry. Breathe Ry, breath.

1:19:14.897 --> 1:19:16.431
You can do it, come on.

1:19:17.466 --> 1:19:18.400
Breathe for me.

1:19:20.268 --> 1:19:21.336
Hold for pulse check.

1:19:24.139 --> 1:19:25.340
Come on, breathe for me.

1:19:27.676 --> 1:19:29.177
Hold for pulse check.

1:19:29.211 --> 1:19:30.379
Here we go, okay.

1:19:30.412 --> 1:19:32.381
You'll be fine no, okay.
You'll be fine now.

1:19:32.414 --> 1:19:33.615
- There you go.
- No!

1:19:33.649 --> 1:19:35.651
Riley.

1:19:35.684 --> 1:19:36.818
Baby.

1:19:36.852 --> 1:19:38.320
Just get the vitals
for me, please?

1:19:38.353 --> 1:19:39.821
Hey guys just stay over for
now. Are you guys family?

1:19:41.623 --> 1:19:42.858
Chris. Chris.

1:19:52.334 --> 1:19:54.137
There's a
wooden box in my room.

1:19:55.671 --> 1:19:57.205
I was gonna give it to
you when I finished it,

1:19:57.239 --> 1:19:58.807
but it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get the chance.

1:19:59.841 --> 1:20:00.676
Open it, okay.

1:20:02.411 --> 1:20:03.245
I love you, Ry.

1:20:17.526 --> 1:20:19.294
Yeah you did good, man.

1:20:20.762 --> 1:20:22.464
Yeah, by the way, I never
got a chance to thank you

1:20:22.497 --> 1:20:24.901
before you know,
dipped out on me, so

1:20:26.035 --> 1:20:27.836
thank you for everything.

1:20:30.305 --> 1:20:33.976
I could join you but I
think I'm good right here.

1:20:35.644 --> 1:20:37.046
Still got hands to hold.

1:20:43.351 --> 1:20:44.120
Ooh.

1:20:47.556 --> 1:20:52.227
What's up? I'm Jordan,
and you look lost.

1:20:53.963 --> 1:20:55.497
It's all right.

1:20:55.530 --> 1:20:57.632
We both dead, in case you
didn't know that already.

1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:02.404
Yes, breathe. Just chill, okay?

1:21:02.437 --> 1:21:05.440
Yeah I mean you're dead
yeah, but it's all good.

1:21:46.481 --> 1:21:47.282
Wait.

1:21:49.886 --> 1:21:50.685
Please?

1:23:38.827 --> 1:23:40.329
Dear Ry,

1:23:40.363 --> 1:23:42.497
I'm not great at writing so

1:23:42.530 --> 1:23:44.367
don't make fund of
me too much for this.

1:23:47.502 --> 1:23:50.705
You'll see I saved every
piece you ever did for me.

1:23:50.739 --> 1:23:53.109
Even the little ones you
wanted me to throw away.

1:23:54.542 --> 1:23:56.178
I stuffed them in my pocket
when you weren't looking.

1:23:58.747 --> 1:24:00.515
This is what you
were born to do, Ry.

1:24:02.151 --> 1:24:03.585
I know that probably
doesn't mean much

1:24:03.618 --> 1:24:05.321
coming from somebody
like me but,

1:24:09.058 --> 1:24:11.260
maybe it'll mean something
coming from yourself.

1:24:15.331 --> 1:24:17.199
You're amazing, Riley.

1:24:17.233 --> 1:24:18.401
Don't give up on this.

1:24:20.802 --> 1:24:22.570
And when you publish
your first graphic novel,

1:24:22.604 --> 1:24:24.373
I want a dedication
right up front.

1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:27.143
Love, Chris.

1:24:54.836 --> 1:24:57.006
A fine arts minor?

1:24:57.039 --> 1:24:58.307
If it's possible, yes.

1:24:59.241 --> 1:25:00.343
Oh, it's definitely possible.

1:25:00.376 --> 1:25:01.843
It's just that
generally we recommend

1:25:01.877 --> 1:25:04.313
a more complimentary minor
for those pursuing law.

1:25:04.347 --> 1:25:05.181
I understand.

1:25:08.017 --> 1:25:09.784
Okay then, fine arts it is.
