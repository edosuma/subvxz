NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:04.422 --> 00:05.662
KAITO: There were
twelve of us.

00:05.756 --> 00:09.214
Now there are nine.

00:09.302 --> 00:11.167
Who wants revenge,
Mrs. Petrelli?

00:11.262 --> 00:12.718
I want my lawyer now.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.553
Where is she?

00:14.640 --> 00:15.846
(SCREAMING)

00:16.893 --> 00:17.973
It's gonna be
all right, Morn.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.437
So you can find anyone
in the world? You just
need to think about them?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.931
There's only
one that I can't.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.639
(WHISPERING)
When I think about him,
he can see me.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.976
Everything
that I had,
it's gone.

00:32.408 --> 00:35.275
Wait.
Take me with you.
I have a car.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.360
NlKl: I'll only be
gone for a while.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.912
And you're gonna be
staying with family.
It could be fun.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.365
Okay. Fine.
I'm a freak,
all right?

00:42.460 --> 00:44.166
Claire. Shut up.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.295
CLAIRE: What's on
yourneck?

00:48.382 --> 00:51.089
Last thing I remember
is this man stepping
out of the bushes,

00:51.177 --> 00:52.166
calling my name.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.501
What are you
talking about?
What man?

00:53.596 --> 00:55.678
The guy with
the horn-rimmed
glasses.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.847
MOHINDER ON PHONE:
I’m sending you a JPEG
ofa painting / found.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.846
It’s the last
in the series.
Eight of eight.

01:12.198 --> 01:16.362
Mr. Muggles and |
just did two whole miles
at the beach.

01:17.203 --> 01:21.412
You wouldn't know it
looking at him, but
this dog can power walk.

01:21.499 --> 01:23.785
Have you talked
to Claire lately?

01:23.876 --> 01:25.036
About what?

01:25.127 --> 01:28.164
Oh, just about
how she's adjusting.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.793
Has she met somebody?
A boy, maybe?

01:31.676 --> 01:34.088
If the wrong person
comes into her life,
it could be...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.385
problematic
for all of us.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.009
What makes you
so sure it's a boy?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.682
What makes you
so sure it isn't?

01:49.193 --> 01:50.603
Is there
something
on my face?

01:50.695 --> 01:52.981
Claire, your mother and I
need to talk to you.

01:53.698 --> 01:54.938
About boys.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.408
Please,
not the sex
talk again.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.323
It was painful enough
the first time.

01:58.411 --> 02:00.242
We just want to
know if you're
seeing anyone.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.785
Why? Because dating
is forbidden too?

02:01.872 --> 02:03.453
Along with cheerleading
and a social life.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.077
Nobody's forbidding
anything, Claire.

02:05.167 --> 02:09.285
It's just that
any outsider could be
a threat to the family.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.122
Dad, believe it or not,
there are people in this world
who aren't out to get us.

02:13.217 --> 02:17.051
Al| we're saying is,
if there is a boy,
I'd like to meet him.

02:17.305 --> 02:21.014
We could help you decide
whether this is somebody
that you could trust.

02:27.398 --> 02:28.433
(SCOFFS)

02:28.524 --> 02:29.889
Dad, relax.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.143
Okay? There's no boy.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.238
(SCREAMING)

02:47.376 --> 02:48.331
(WHISPERING)
Okay. It's okay.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.499
(CRYING) I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.708
(SHUSHING)
It's okay.
Get the light.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.508
MOHINDER: Molly?
MATT: She's fine.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.335
Okay, put your head down.

03:00.056 --> 03:01.842
It's over. Right?

03:01.932 --> 03:04.719
Okay. You want
something to drink?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.766
Water.
Water. Okay.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.388
(SIGHING)

03:13.944 --> 03:15.650
It's getting worse.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.858
Two a night now.
I'm trying to listen in,
get in her head.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.200
And I keep
getting
thrown back.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.524
So what are we
supposed to do?

03:21.619 --> 03:22.654
I don't know.
You're the scientist.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.861
That doesn't exactly
make me an expert
on nightmares.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.082
Well,
that makes
two of us.

03:28.334 --> 03:32.703
(SIGHING) I don't know. I'll
go get the water. Just keep
her calm and we'll just...

03:32.797 --> 03:34.662
Figure it out. Right?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.714
(WHISPERING) Just try
to get some sleep,
sweetheart.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.765
When will they stop?

03:47.478 --> 03:48.934
I don't know.

Hey, boys.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.248
You grew a beard.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.624
You like it?

04:18.217 --> 04:19.673
No?

04:20.344 --> 04:22.175
Want me to shave it?

04:23.431 --> 04:26.264
Listen, I wanted to tell you
that your grandmother's
in the hospital.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.430
Is she okay?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.429
Yeah.
She's gonna
be fine.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.761
But when you get home,
I want you to get your mommy

04:31.856 --> 04:33.016
to help you call her, okay?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.643
'Cause I know
she's gonna wanna
hear from you.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.985
Okay.

04:37.862 --> 04:41.525
I know I haven't
been around and
I'm sorry about that.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.285
But I'm
coming home.
I promise.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.039
And what do Petrellis do
when they make promises?

04:52.126 --> 04:53.115
Keep them!
Keep them.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.325
That's right.

Can I help you?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.202
I'm their father.

04:57.423 --> 05:00.210
You know
you're not allowed
to be here.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.792
Go ahead.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.469
No. Iwant to
stay with you.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.171
It's okay.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.506
Go on.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.346
See you soon. Okay?

05:12.438 --> 05:13.769
Go ahead.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.036

05:35.002 --> 05:38.460
The license on the car.
It says California.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.960
Oh. That. No,
I just picked
the car up there.

05:42.051 --> 05:44.087
I'm actually
from Jersey.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.669

very close
to New York.

young man.
He's a guest in our house.

We'll see about that.

Good morning,
everybody.

07:22.026 --> 07:24.938

any different today?

07:25.029 --> 07:26.815
Just as lame
as you always do.

"Confident" is good.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.699
How about
"in charge"?
Micah?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.038
Yeah. You look like
someone who's in charge.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.283
And why do I look like
someone who's in charge?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.365
Because somebody died
and left you that way?

07:39.460 --> 07:43.453
No. Because today
is the day they're posting
the test results

07:43.547 --> 07:45.458
for the regional manager
training program.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.006
The test I just
happened to
have aced.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.173
All right.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.094
Good, so now you can afford
that $65 I asked you for.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.387
MONICA: No, I can't.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.133
And don't be asking
Grandma, either. Don't
give him a dime, Nana.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.969
He wants it for some
wrestling match on
Pay-Per-View tonight.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.227
Half the people in this county
are living in FEMA trailers,
and you wanna spend

08:03.317 --> 08:06.275
good money to watch
grown men jump around
in their underwear.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.819
You can walk down
Bourbon Street for that.

But, it's the night
of the tag team title.
I can't miss it.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.906
You should be watching
something educational.
Like this.

out of tomatoes?

time to do that?

dinner home
from the restaurant.

I think I know a way
to get you Pay-Per-View.

the reasons
you said.

I did it. I pushed him off.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.010
When we brought you in,
you tried to kill yourself.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.562
Turns out your wounds
were self-inflicted.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.059
l was distraught.

and so I... l attacked myself.

the statement and

why are you
doing this?

09:46.670 --> 09:49.503
My head is clear now.
I understand.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.249
The only way out of this
is for me to confess.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.341
Fine. Let's start
the paperwork.

10:00.142 --> 10:04.385
ANGELA: If they keep digging
they will find out about all
of us and what we can do.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.856
Let it go.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.442
Let it go.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.985
What's that?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.533
Parental release form
to try out for
the cheerleading squad.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.486
For me?
Yup.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.957
l'm flattered. I don't think
I can squeeze cheerleading
into my schedule.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.535
But you're kind of a hero
to the girls in the squad.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.915
A hero? Why?

10:31.006 --> 10:32.917
The way
you stood up to Debbie
on your first day.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.465
You know, half of
being a cheerleader
is having guts.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.929
And you have got
those in spades.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.802
I'll tell you what.
I'll think about it

10:42.893 --> 10:45.259
and then I'll let you know
if I change my mind.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.767
Good, then take
the release form
just in case.

about yesterday.
It was so amazing.

I can be myselfwith.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

11:02.579 --> 11:04.194
About that...

11:04.289 --> 11:07.076
I'm not sure
we should
hang out anymore.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.502
It's just my parents
are really overprotective.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.875
Is this because
we flew together?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.999
I weirded you out,
didn't I?
No.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.334
I like you.
I really do.

11:18.428 --> 11:22.216
Then it's those marks on
my neck, right? You think
I was abducted by aliens.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.843
I told you, it was a guy
with horn-rimmed glasses.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.424
It's my dad.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.938
He's just really
overprotective
about the dating thing.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.526
Then let me talk to him.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.987
I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.277
(EXHALES) But...

11:38.740 --> 11:41.072
I can fly,
and you
can regenerate.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.115
I mean, doesn't that
tell you anything?

11:43.203 --> 11:46.411
Please don't make this
harder on me than it
already is.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.492

want to go.

after that, fine.

is coerced.
She's sick.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.653
Coerced or not,
they believe her.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.037
But I know she's innocent.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.368
How?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.124
(SIGHING)

12:42.429 --> 12:45.091
(WHISPERING)
The same way I know
that you can fly.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.808
I can read your mind.
Just like I read
your mother's.

12:49.895 --> 12:53.103
But I can't tell my partner
what I know or how I know it.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.647
Are you reading
my mind right now?

12:55.734 --> 12:56.769
No.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.396
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.487
Look, your mother
thinks she's protecting
somebody

13:03.575 --> 13:04.690
by shutting down
this investigation.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.446
But I'm not gonna
let it happen.
I'm not backing down.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.663
I got a little girl at home
who wakes up in
the middle of the night

13:08.747 --> 13:12.956
screaming about nightmares
and drawing a symbol that...

13:13.627 --> 13:17.040
This. The same symbol
that's on these photos.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.963
I know this symbol.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.462
(WHISPERING) I think
it's all connected.
Everything.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.419
What you and I can do?
We're all connected.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.092
I know this photograph.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.640
Good. Because
I need your help.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.185
I can't continue
this investigation
without you.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.560
All right. I'II...

13:39.236 --> 13:41.477
I need five minutes
alone with my mother.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.903
Alone.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.499
Why are you confessing
to a crime
you didn't commit?

13:58.463 --> 14:00.419
Because
you were right,
Nathan.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.168
I don't deserve to be saved.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.171
Mom, I was angry when
I said that. l was drunk.
I didn't mean it.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.002
Of course you did.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.590
You asked me for help once.
Nowjust let me help you.

14:12.310 --> 14:16.019
Just because you've shaved
doesn't mean you're clean
and sober.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.973
You still have
to get yourself
into a program.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.901
Get your family back.
Don't let your children
hate you.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.357
Not if you can help it.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.779
You didn't kill
Kaito Nakamura.
I know that.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.452
I have done so many
bad things in my life.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.951
It really doesn't matter
what crime I confess to.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.031
Let me help you, Mom.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.491
No. What you want
is redemption.

14:37.586 --> 14:41.170
And you're not gonna
get it by helping me.
You'll just get killed.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.918
And I can't bear
to lose another son.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.262
(CLEARS THROAT)
He has to do this.
I'm sorry.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.483
That's all right.
I'm ready.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.335
Where's your stuff?
You're traveling
pretty light.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.011
I got robbed.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.594
Been walking for three days.
Thank God you came along.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.346
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

15:38.480 --> 15:40.266
Where are you going?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.770
I'm going home.
To America.
New York.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.849
New York.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.353
This is where
we're going.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.612
Do you have family there?

15:49.699 --> 15:50.825
No.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.276
We need to find this man.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.406
Maya, no.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.953
Dr. Suresh.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.786
Well this is a coincidence.
I know this book.
I've read it.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.960
Really?

16:09.719 --> 16:12.461
Why are you
searching for
Dr. Suresh?

16:12.556 --> 16:14.968
For, how you say this...

16:15.058 --> 16:16.889
Answers.
To what?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.012
I know Dr. Suresh.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.182
We're old friends.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.483
You and Dr. Suresh?

16:26.570 --> 16:30.813
You've helped me, now
I can return the favor.
I can take you to him.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.898
I can help you find him.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.779
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

16:49.426 --> 16:51.917
Thank you.
I don't know
what to say.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.923
I don't even
know your name.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.174
It's Gabriel.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.642
Gabriel Gray.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.764
Gabriel.

17:01.855 --> 17:02.844
(GASPING)

17:02.939 --> 17:04.600
Like the angel.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.099
Yeah.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.856
Just like the angel.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.116
(SINGING)
/ spent oh so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself

17:18.288 --> 17:21.530
/ used to cry
But now / hold
my head up high

17:21.625 --> 17:24.583
They've got rules against
drinking on the job, you know.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.750
It's all about
attitude, Camille.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.749
(SCOFFS)
What's about
aﬂﬂude?

17:28.840 --> 17:32.799
Life and today
is the first day
of the rest of mine.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.626
You sound like
a fortune cookie.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.758
No. I sound like
a woman with a future.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.390
Is there something
you're not telling me?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.684
I took the test.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.136
Are you pregnant?

17:45.232 --> 17:50.022
No! Girl, now, how am I
gonna be pregnant wearing
this outfit two shifts a day?

17:50.111 --> 17:53.979
The management
training program.
I took the test.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.655
Oh, that.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.742
What do you mean,
"Oh, that"?

17:58.828 --> 18:02.116
Nothing. ljust think
you shouldn't get
your hopes up, that's all.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.914
Only a fool would put money
on a one-in-5O chance.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.583
Look, if I make manager,
I can earn enough money

18:07.671 --> 18:09.582
to go back
to school,
get my degree.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.289
I can move
my family
out of here.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.921
It's not right,
one storm comes
rolling through here

18:15.011 --> 18:17.548
and blows away
my whole life.

18:17.639 --> 18:22.303
My mother,
my college education,
my dreams.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.765
I'm sorry.

18:27.649 --> 18:31.107
It's just you've been talking
like this since we were
in kindergarten.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.436
One scheme after another,
and nothing ever happens.

18:38.994 --> 18:43.033
What in the world?
Where did you learn
to do that?

18:48.837 --> 18:52.125
I don't...
Monica, let me talk
to you for a sec.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.469
I'm sorry, Monica.
You're just not qualified
for the management program.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.600
So I didn't do well
on the test?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.147
You did fine.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.225
Not top tier, but...
But what?

19:13.320 --> 19:17.108
I'm motivated and
I'm hardworking. Mr. Lamont,
I've never missed a day.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.449
That's not the issue.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.818
A management position means

19:19.909 --> 19:22.776
you need to be to be available
for any location in the state.

19:22.871 --> 19:26.079
And it's just not right
for someone
in your situation.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.201
My situation?

19:27.292 --> 19:28.372
Your home life.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.371
Your brother,
your grandmother.
That's the point!

19:30.462 --> 19:33.204
I'm the breadwinner.
I need the money. And...

19:33.298 --> 19:35.664
I mean,
I can't make hamburgers
for the rest of my life.

19:35.759 --> 19:39.126
You're good
at yourjob, Monica.
What's wrong with that?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.801
And you should be
happy you have one.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.756
There's a lot of people
in this city who don't.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.140
(SCOFFS)

19:48.938 --> 19:51.190
I thought for dessert,

19:51.274 --> 19:55.392
we could go to that
adorable yogurt place
near the bus depot.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.738
lcant.lhave
to go to the library
for a research paper.

20:00.825 --> 20:04.158
The library?
Haven't you ever
heard of the Internet?

20:06.081 --> 20:11.041
Actually, the research paper
is on libraries and how
during the digital age

20:11.127 --> 20:14.790
they're becoming
increasingly obsolete
for our generation.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.214
Do you need a lift?

20:19.302 --> 20:20.291
What?

20:20.387 --> 20:21.547
Your car.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.845
It got stolen. Remember?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.925
So do you?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.011
That's okay.
I think I'm just
gonna walk.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.312
Okay.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.492
Hi.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.494
Hi.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.553
The photo's gotta be
in here somewhere.
It's a group shot.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.012
Maybe 10, 12 people.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.096
What kind of group is it?

21:15.191 --> 21:18.604
It was a party or a meeting.
My parents were in it.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.444
Kaito Nakamura.
You knew Nakamura?

21:21.531 --> 21:22.771
No. My folks did.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.276
He use to come over
the house sometimes.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.028
My father didn't seem
to care for him too much.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.325
I remember
the last time
I saw him,

21:27.412 --> 21:31.155
my Mom hugged him,
and it lasted just
a little bit too long.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.034
What about
the others
in the group?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.662
Linderman was in it.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.617
Charles Deveaux, too.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.622
A lot of them are dead now.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.046
These your boys?

21:46.514 --> 21:47.720
Yeah.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.893
What? You don't
see them that often?
Look, I don't...

21:50.977 --> 21:54.014
I'm sorry,
I don't really
know you that well.

21:54.105 --> 21:58.064
My wife...
My ex-wife
cheated on me.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.400
Which I could have
forgiven her for,

22:01.488 --> 22:05.197
except for that fact
that she was pregnant
with his baby.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.737
Why are you
telling me
all this?

22:07.827 --> 22:11.115
ljust... I know a bunch
of stuff about you,
I figured it's only fair.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.492
If you wanna unload,
go ahead.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.793
Six months ago,
I was a cop in LA.
Married.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.671
Expecting a child.
And all of a sudden
this stuff started happening.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.421
It just turned
everything
upside down.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.927
(SIGHING) I'm just
looking for answers.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.600
Maybe this will help.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.652
MATT: That's the same photo.

22:41.736 --> 22:42.896
NATHAN: Half the people
in this picture are dead.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.693
It's like the killer's
picking off one by one.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.737
Maybe one of these
is the killer.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.527
NATHAN: Look,
here's my father.
This is my mother.

22:48.618 --> 22:51.781
Charles Deveaux,
Linderman,
Kaito Nakamura.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.157
This guy's name is Bob.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.121
Bob. I don't know
his last name.

22:56.209 --> 22:59.121
I don't know
the rest of the people
in that picture, either.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.452
MATT: I know him.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.662
How?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.795
That's my father.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.980
CAMILLE: Hey.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.276
"Making hamburgers."
Is he kidding me?

23:29.367 --> 23:31.574
I swear, I'd like
to smack him
upside his head.

23:31.661 --> 23:35.028
I'm glad you didn't.
You can't afford
to get fired.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.581
I can't explain it,
but I know I'm supposed
to be somebody.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.751
I feel like there's
something inside me
that wants to come out.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.250
Does that make any sense?

23:44.340 --> 23:46.831
You lost more than
most in the storm.

23:46.926 --> 23:51.511
And that kind of loss,
it takes a while. You
shouldn't be in such a hurry.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.434
I don't know.
Maybe God's
punishing me.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.975
Now, why would he do that?

23:58.062 --> 23:59.222
For being selfish.

24:00.064 --> 24:04.103
I pray for it every Sunday
in church. For God
to find me a way out of here.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.981
Everybody else is praying
for the community,
to put things back together,

24:08.072 --> 24:10.734
to give them
strength. Not me.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.316
I'm just praying
for a way out.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.743
That's terrible, isn't it?

24:16.831 --> 24:21.700
Monica, given the situation,
I'd say it's pretty normal.

24:22.587 --> 24:23.827
Normal.

24:25.882 --> 24:28.043
Yeah.
That's me,
all right.

24:30.219 --> 24:34.383
I offer to take you anywhere,
and this is all you can
come up with.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.383
(CHUCKLES)
What can I say?
I'm a cheap date.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.720
WEST: You've got
a thing for heights, huh?

24:43.650 --> 24:46.983
There was this place
near where I used
to live in Texas.

24:47.070 --> 24:52.406
There was this
old gravel tower. I used to
climb up to the top of it.

24:54.202 --> 24:56.067
See what I could do.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.450
You'd jump off?

25:00.750 --> 25:01.910
Yeah.

25:03.086 --> 25:06.874
I guess I've just
been thinking
a lot about my life.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.089
How it all
went away so fast.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.088
And why did it go away?

25:14.681 --> 25:16.592
I can't tell you that.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.424
The truth is,
so many terrible things
happened to me

25:19.519 --> 25:21.305
While I lived there.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.522
I'm not sure I could
ever open up
to anyone again.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.693
Well, we're here together.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.273
So part of you
must want to
share something.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.446
I want to trust you.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.698
Then jump.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.826
What?

25:42.917 --> 25:44.453
Trust begins
with a leap.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.159
Cheesy but true.

42:08.276 --> 42:09.311
Leave me alone.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.402
No!No!No!
Molly! Molly!

42:14.950 --> 42:15.939
Matt...

42:17.786 --> 42:19.697
MOHINDER: Molly? Molly?
Molly?

42:20.414 --> 42:22.154
She's breathing.
What happened?

42:22.249 --> 42:23.284
She's in shock.
She won't wake up.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.831
Come on.
Molly, you did it.
It's time to get up.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.158
MOHINDER: Matt, don't.
Molly, it's time to get up.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.368
MOHINDER: Matt, don't.
Come on. Wake up.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.577
Don't...

42:28.672 --> 42:30.628
MOLLY: Matt, help me!

42:33.135 --> 42:34.124
Matt!
