WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.636
Even though my father
hadn't called me on my
last three birthdays,

00:04.638 --> 00:07.740
This time,
I was hopeful,

00:07.742 --> 00:10.476
So I waited
until midnight

00:10.478 --> 00:13.479
<i>And when</i>
<i>he didn't call,</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:16.515
I was completely...

00:18.284 --> 00:20.085
- Devastated.
- Yes!

00:20.087 --> 00:21.286
Damn it!

00:21.288 --> 00:23.655
- What's going on?
- I just made 20 bucks.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.458
I had "devastated"
in the patrick pool.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.328
I was sure
he'd say "aghast."

00:29.330 --> 00:31.363
When it's family members
or bad chardonnay,

00:31.365 --> 00:33.032
He always goes with
"aghast."

00:34.267 --> 00:36.435
Everything
in patrick's life
either makes him feel

00:36.437 --> 00:39.304
Devastated, aghast,
or speechless.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.773
I cannot believe this.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.442
I am speech--
I hate you people.

00:44.778 --> 00:48.113
Well, I have to say
that I am disappointed.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.815
Whoo!

00:55.321 --> 00:57.322
- Disappointed.
- Whoo!

00:59.459 --> 01:01.760
Okay, okay. I think I see
what's going on here.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.330
Lately, you're either
"disappointed"

01:05.332 --> 01:07.499
Or "extremely
disappointed."

01:07.501 --> 01:10.169
That's because you're
supposed to be sharing,
not attacking each other.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.372
Lacey, you of all people
should understand
patrick's pain.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.506
<i>You have</i>
<i>a distant father also.</i>

01:14.508 --> 01:17.276
Probably some
nomadic arab,

01:17.278 --> 01:20.079
Spends all his time
in the desert looking
for the goat

01:20.081 --> 01:22.548
That's gonna be
his next wife.

01:22.550 --> 01:26.251
I told you a thousand times,
old man.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.187
He was born in india.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.290
Get a globe,
you bloated hillbilly.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.726
Lacey, that's enough.
Listen to yourselves.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.396
You've been doing nothing
but sniping at each other.

01:37.398 --> 01:41.133
Is so you can help each other
resolve your anger issues,

01:41.135 --> 01:43.402
Not-- not bet on
what patrick will say

01:43.404 --> 01:46.738
Or-- or laugh when nolan
gets lost in his hoodie.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.874
Yeah, it's not funny.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.610
Once your head's
in the sleeve,
panic sets in.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.114
I'm sorry.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.815
It was funny for
the first couple minutes.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.383
Then it was sad.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.420
Then it was really,
really funny again.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.821
You might wanna
take a lesson

02:02.823 --> 02:06.358
From the "taj ma-whore"
over there.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.694
She doesn't have any trouble
getting outta her clothes.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.163
Patrick:
She is not a slut, ed.

02:11.165 --> 02:14.366
Her clothes fall off her body
because they're cheap
and poorly made.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.368
Shut up!

02:16.370 --> 02:17.736
Oh, what's
the matter, lacey?

02:17.738 --> 02:20.139
- Are you devastated?
- Okay, okay, stop it!

02:20.141 --> 02:21.373
Stop it!

02:21.375 --> 02:23.442
What is wrong
with you people?

02:23.444 --> 02:26.145
You know what?
Don't answer that.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.247
Nobody talk.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.849
We are all...

02:30.851 --> 02:33.919
Gonna close our eyes
and sit here for a minute

02:33.921 --> 02:35.888
And reflect
on what just happened.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.557
( both sigh )

03:00.713 --> 03:03.215
Hey, charlie.
Aren't you supposed
to be in group?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.551
Yeah, but
they're pissing me off.
I'm really disappointed.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.286
Nolan:
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

03:08.788 --> 03:10.656
Meditate!

03:13.793 --> 03:15.794
You guys back from
horseback riding already?

03:15.796 --> 03:18.864
We never went.
We found out they
retired butterscotch.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.500
Oh, no.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.768
( quietly )
who's butterscotch?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.638
My favorite horse
of all time.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.441
They shipped him off
to an "equine therapy ranch"

03:29.443 --> 03:32.945
In san bernardino,
but I think we all know
what that means.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.616
They didn't
kill the horse, mom.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.718
Equine therapy
is a real thing.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.553
People go
to take care of a horse

03:41.555 --> 03:43.522
So they can relax
and de-stress.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.790
That's right, honey.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.259
Of course,
it's a real thing.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.962
Butterscotch
is alive and well

03:49.964 --> 03:53.732
And helping people
not be crazy by being alive.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.969
Dad, will you
please tell her?

03:56.971 --> 03:59.404
Let me see
if I can help.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.939
It's true, jen.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.408
Equine therapy
<i>is</i> a real thing.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.511
And so are crazy people.

04:07.547 --> 04:10.282
No crap?
Well, that's cool.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.517
Hey, the horse is alive.

04:12.519 --> 04:13.919
Uh-uh.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.657
What?
It just sounded fake.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.759
Well, it's not.
It's a highly
respected method

04:20.761 --> 04:25.430
Of helping people
with anxiety, add,
social disorders.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.566
Basically everyone
in the other room.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.004
You think
they're open next week?
Maybe I can take the group.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.939
Hey, you could
take me and sam.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.608
- She could
see butterscotch.
- Well, I guess.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.610
I mean, she'd be
hanging with the group,
if you're okay with that.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.446
Sure. I'm always saying
sam doesn't have enough

04:41.448 --> 04:43.582
Angry, psychotic
role models.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.317
Don't beat
yourself up, jen.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.519
There's only so much
one woman can do.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.322
I'm gonna go tell
the group about the trip.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.757
They're meditating.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.962
You know what?
I'll tell 'em later.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.697
They're gone,
aren't they?

04:58.699 --> 05:02.401
Everyone except ed.
He's asleep.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.969
Someone drew what
I can only hope

05:03.971 --> 05:06.972
Is a rocket ship
going into his mouth.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.575
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:12.912 --> 05:14.579
Horse therapy.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.049
So you really think
that's going to help
your group bond?

05:17.051 --> 05:18.750
Haven't you seen
"seabiscuit"?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.852
That horse
healed a nation and...

05:20.854 --> 05:22.688
Fought the germans,
or something.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.757
- That doesn't sound right.
- Fine, I didn't see it,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.326
But I can tell from the poster
that whatever he did

05:27.328 --> 05:28.960
Was pretty impressive.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.030
Charlie, therapy groups
are like rock bands.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.333
Eventually they get sick
of each other, it becomes toxic,

05:34.335 --> 05:37.402
Somebody has to leave,
usually the bass player.

05:37.404 --> 05:40.439
I was the best thing
in that band.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.342
Yeah, well, my gut tells me
they still have something
to offer each other.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.043
Charlie, you only think
with two things,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.512
Your gut and your gut's
downstairs neighbor.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.350
And they both
make dumb decisions.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.018
It's time to start
using your brain.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.722
You know what?
I can't be in
a nonemotional,

05:56.724 --> 05:59.791
No-commitment relationship
with you if you don't
respect me.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.059
Aw, come on, charlie.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.428
I thought you were happy
with our dynamic.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.865
You're reaching
and I'm settling.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.368
Cute.

06:09.370 --> 06:13.138
But even freud said
that there's meaning
behind every joke...

06:13.140 --> 06:15.140
Except for the one
about the restaurant
on the moon.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.075
The restaurant
on the moon?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.911
Yeah, it's got
no atmosphere.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.146
That's just funny.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.483
Actually, it's a commentary
on societal norms

06:24.485 --> 06:26.985
And the expectations
of the <i>nouveau riche.</i>

06:26.987 --> 06:28.153
Okay, I don't think
you get it.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.955
The place
has got no air.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.860
God, you are the most
condescending person
I've ever met.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.562
I don't think you mean
"condescending."

06:37.564 --> 06:39.965
I think you mean
"patronizing."

06:39.967 --> 06:42.567
Don't tell me what I mean.
I'll tell you what I mean.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.069
Then tell me
what you mean.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.171
It's got no air!

06:49.475 --> 06:52.010
Everybody,
this is butterface.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.445
It's butterscotch, sir.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.013
( scoffs )
of course it is.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.848
Look at him,
his face is beautiful.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.784
And this is jimmy.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.719
He'll teach you
how to groom and feed
butterscotch.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.621
But no riding.
That's our policy.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.158
Despite what
every single picture
in the brochure suggests.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.926
Would you like
to pet him, miss?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.662
I don't pet animals.
They get too excited.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.065
Well, he's not
excited now.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.068
He's feeling
scared and tired.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.070
How in the hell
would you know that?

07:19.072 --> 07:21.173
Well, I've had a mystical
connection with horses

07:21.175 --> 07:23.942
Ever since I was 10
when one kicked me
in the head.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.779
Well, there's one tiny
piece of the puzzle.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.216
Anyway, as a group
you'll be responsible
for his daily care.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.584
Grooming, feeding,
exercising,

07:32.586 --> 07:33.752
Cleaning out his stall.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.554
Nolan can't
do that for himself.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.223
How in the hell is he
gonna do it for a horse?

07:38.225 --> 07:40.859
All right, all right.
Everybody needs to chill
around the horse.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.494
He's a little stressed
since they moved him here

07:42.496 --> 07:43.995
And they haven't
gotten him to eat yet.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.766
If I weighed 1,200 pounds,
I wouldn't eat either.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.201
Oh, you'd eat.

07:49.203 --> 07:52.838
But you'd so be jamming
your hoof down your throat.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.739
So let's divvy up
the chores.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.109
- Who wants to do what?
- Ooh, can I do nothing?

07:58.111 --> 08:01.813
The bonding experience
only works if everyone
participates.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.915
Can't we just bond
as a group separately?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.183
I get along with people
so much better

08:05.185 --> 08:07.185
When I'm not around them.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.088
That kind of sarcasm may work
in the big city, patrick,

08:10.090 --> 08:11.690
But you're out here
in cowboy country now.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.959
35 minutes east
of the big city,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.061
Depending on traffic.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.064
Now who wants
to try to get
butterscotch to eat?

08:19.066 --> 08:22.834
I brought a bag of something
that always makes me hungry.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.504
We want him to eat,
not sit around and
watch cartoons.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.641
Hey, ed, why don't you
handle the grooming?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.142
All right.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.278
Now don't let
this thing throw you.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.649
It's for something
younger people call hair.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.618
Patrick, that's
the kind of behavior

08:39.620 --> 08:41.286
That we're
trying to change.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.154
So, since you
can dish it out,

08:43.156 --> 08:44.789
Let's see if you
can scoop it up.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.057
( laughs )

08:46.059 --> 08:47.292
Looks like somebody
picked the wrong day

08:47.294 --> 08:50.795
To wear suede loafers
with no socks.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.964
- That's not helpful, nolan.
- Oh, butterscotch said it.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.667
I just repeated it.
Good one.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.272
( gasps )
oh, my gosh!

09:00.274 --> 09:03.141
Butterscotch, hi!

09:03.143 --> 09:06.278
I missed you so much!

09:06.280 --> 09:07.579
Hey.

09:07.581 --> 09:11.216
- 'sup?
- Nothin'.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.318
Cool.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.587
- 'sup?
- Mom!

09:15.589 --> 09:16.955
What?

09:19.325 --> 09:22.227
Hey. Did you see what
was going on back there?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.762
Yeah, I saw
and I'm worried.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.197
Me, too.
But he is gorgeous.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.666
Yeah, I guess.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.267
He does have those
big, beautiful eyes.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.169
Makes you want to
take care of him.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.340
I'm worried he's gonna
try and have sex with sam.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.876
Butterscotch?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.946
The stable boy!
What the hell's
wrong with you?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.081
Aren't you worried she's
gonna hook up with jimmy?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.016
Well, now that
I've considered
this other thing,

09:45.018 --> 09:47.719
That doesn't seem so bad.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.055
She can't take her eyes
off that boy.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.890
It's all in your head,
mrs. Robinson.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.192
Just because you wanna
gallop bareback on
the stable boy

09:54.194 --> 09:56.227
Doesn't mean sam does.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.230
"gallop bareback"?
I'm old enough
to be his milf.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.267
Uh, technically you're
not somebody's milf.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.902
You're a milf.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.837
Oh, thank you.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.977
People think you're
old and tired

10:11.979 --> 10:14.245
And no use to anybody,
don't they?

10:14.247 --> 10:17.215
Sounds like you two
have a lot in common.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.751
No, he reminds me
of my wife.

10:19.753 --> 10:23.221
Except people
still wanna ride you,
don't they, buddy?

10:23.223 --> 10:26.157
Could you move, please?
I wanna do his bangs.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.662
Okay, almost perfect.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.632
Now you just gotta shake it out
like you just don't care.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.302
I'm only feeding him
a couple extra bags of carrots.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.837
I don't see
what the problem is.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.006
The problem is I have
to clean up after him.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.041
There is orange poop
everywhere.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.409
You have turned
this poor animal

10:44.411 --> 10:47.145
Into a play-doh
fun factory.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.181
Shut up, you're
upsetting the horse.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.250
You shut up.
You're the one
yelling in his ear

10:52.252 --> 10:56.688
And trying to turn him
into a five-dollar,
four-legged whore.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.224
Hey, the horse says
to stop yelling at her.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.760
And he also thinks
she looks really hot.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.995
And it wouldn't kill her
to wear a miniskirt tomorrow.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.866
Stop acting like this horse
is talking to you
inside your head.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.335
Oh, my god, lacey, what
have you done to his mane?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.170
Somebody get me
a flat iron!

11:12.172 --> 11:15.840
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to you people

11:15.842 --> 11:18.109
Treat this horse like
some kind of an animal.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.944
Where you going, ed?

11:21.380 --> 11:24.015
- What happened here?
- I'll tell you what
happened here.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.685
The last time I was around
people I hated this much,

11:26.687 --> 11:28.420
I was around these people.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.055
<i>( manure plops )</i>

11:30.057 --> 11:33.191
Okay, the fun factory's
open again

11:33.193 --> 11:35.026
And I am not playing.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.400
It's okay, nolan.
You don't have to stay.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.269
Oh, thank god.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.871
The horse has asked me to do
some really weird things.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.310
( sighs )

11:52.312 --> 11:53.945
Well, butterscotch,
maybe I was wrong

11:53.947 --> 11:55.880
About keeping
the group together.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.120
( lower )
yes, you were,
you big jackass.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.888
Nice language,
butterscotch.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.057
What, were you
raised in a barn?

12:06.059 --> 12:10.228
( lower )
that wasn't funny
when my mom said it.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.731
( lower )
might've been funnier
if he was raised

12:12.733 --> 12:15.066
In a restaurant
on the moon.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.439
What are you doing
all the way out here?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.308
It was 20 minutes,
no traffic.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.077
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.512
You came to apologize.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.181
No, I came here because
I like to ride horses

12:30.183 --> 12:33.151
And I like the smell
of hay, not to apologize.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.519
Apology accepted.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.021
Thank you.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.791
( sighs )
and I'm sorry your
group bonding experiment

12:39.793 --> 12:41.159
Isn't going well.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.395
That was the horse's
opinion, not mine.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.398
But at least lacey
put some glitter on the horse

12:47.400 --> 12:49.868
And turned it into
a better-than-average
looking stripper.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.238
Look...

12:53.240 --> 12:56.107
I know how bad
you must feel.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.942
I look into your eyes

12:57.944 --> 13:00.011
And I can see
how you're hurting

13:00.013 --> 13:01.379
And I feel
terrible for you.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.915
Guh.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.517
What?
I was being sincere.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.452
I know
and it was awful.

13:07.454 --> 13:11.489
I liked it much better
when you were being
condescending.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.093
I'm gonna make 'em
stick it out one more day
and try to make this work.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.295
- You know why?
- Nonrefundable deposit.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.831
- A little.
- ( chuckles )

13:19.833 --> 13:21.533
But mostly because
I believe in them.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.501
Oh, you're an idiot.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.403
And she's back.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.006
See you in a minute.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.408
Oh, and, uh,
when you do,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.311
Maybe it would be
really hot if we went
for a horseback ride.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.413
Oh, no.
They don't allow you
to ride the horses out here.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.184
You know, I had
my first orgasm
riding a horse.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.123
He does seem
like he could use
a little exercise.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.230
Can I see all the members
of butterscotch's group,
please?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.398
( sighs )

13:53.400 --> 13:55.233
( sighs )

14:01.073 --> 14:03.308
Look, I know
you guys aren't loving
this whole horse thing.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.244
That's not true.
We love butterscotch.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.279
We just can't stand
each other.

14:08.281 --> 14:13.117
And this wagon wheel
nightmare that is a hotel.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.086
Fine, that's
your prerogative.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.921
You can give up
on the group,

14:16.923 --> 14:19.090
But you cannot ditch
your responsibilities
to that horse.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.259
I don't care how you do it,
but that horse will be
taken care of

14:21.261 --> 14:22.594
Until we leave
on Sunday.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.395
Fine, I'll feed him.

14:24.397 --> 14:28.366
Butterscotch reminds me
of my old army buddy, hank.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.603
Hank also ate an apple
out of my hand.

14:31.605 --> 14:35.874
'course, he'd just had
both his arms blown off...

14:35.876 --> 14:38.343
So it's
a little different.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.380
Well, you know
what they say.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.349
"an apple a day..."

14:49.188 --> 14:51.055
All right.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.324
I can make
a quick schedule

14:53.326 --> 14:55.660
Where we all have
visitation rights

14:55.662 --> 14:57.328
And none of us
have to see each other.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.265
Ed, you can take butterscotch
in the mornings.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.967
Nolan can take him
in the afternoons.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.237
I can take him
for dinner.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.406
And lacey can put him
to bed at night.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.675
Great. You know
he hates to go to sleep

15:10.677 --> 15:12.911
So I have to be the
disciplinarian

15:12.913 --> 15:14.545
And you get to be
the fun one.

15:14.547 --> 15:18.149
You're just jealous
because the horse and I
have a rapport.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.084
Oh, like you're
his favorite?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.586
He's ashamed of you.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.357
Hey, did you know before
this was a horse ranch,

15:26.359 --> 15:30.261
It was just land
that had no horses on it?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.564
That's amazing.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.001
So, who are you texting?

15:37.003 --> 15:39.070
I don't know.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.240
You know, we really
don't get to

15:42.242 --> 15:45.109
Talk like this at home.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.345
You really have to get away
for this kind of bonding.

15:48.547 --> 15:52.050
( claps )
so, that stable
boy, jimmy...

15:52.052 --> 15:54.552
- He's pretty cute, huh?
- I don't know.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.154
Mm-hmm.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.258
Look, I may be
worried over nothing,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.193
But you just don't
want to get caught up

16:02.195 --> 16:05.263
In the excitement
of being away from home
for the weekend

16:05.265 --> 16:07.332
And do something
you'll regret.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.501
Mom, I'm not
going to have sex.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.104
I still have those condoms
you gave me when I was 13

16:13.106 --> 16:16.307
And you thought
I was going to be
a more popular teenager.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.211
Well, if you ever do
wanna talk about it,
I'm here.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.280
We have talks about sex
all the time.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.416
I wish you'd get a boyfriend
so we could talk about
something else.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.387
Me, too.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.192
So, how was that
for you?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.493
You still need me
for anything?

16:35.495 --> 16:40.331
Would you be offended
if I called you butterscotch?

16:42.401 --> 16:44.135
I was kind of hoping
you'd be done

16:44.137 --> 16:45.403
Because what riding
does for women

16:45.405 --> 16:47.372
Does the opposite
for men.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.173
- You're kidding.
- A lot of bouncing
on things

16:49.175 --> 16:51.275
That don't need
to be bounced on.

16:51.277 --> 16:54.278
Oh, well, I've got
bad news, pardner.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.314
You got lots more
bouncing to do.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.352
( moaning )

17:01.354 --> 17:03.287
Hard to believe,
but this is going to be

17:03.289 --> 17:05.423
My first actual
roll in the hay.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.226
It's also your first
stable relationship.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.294
( whinnies )

17:10.296 --> 17:11.696
Hey, butterscotch
liked it.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.431
<i>( butterscotch whinnies )</i>

17:13.433 --> 17:15.233
<i>( thuds )</i>

17:20.272 --> 17:24.242
Oh, my god.
I think your joke
just killed the horse.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.576
He's just sleeping,

17:25.578 --> 17:27.378
You know, with
his tongue hanging out

17:27.380 --> 17:28.813
And foam coming out
of his mouth.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.349
I've been that tired.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.084
Charlie,
the only thing missing

17:33.086 --> 17:35.386
Are the cartoon xs
over his eyes.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.122
Oh, this is--
this is so bad.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.323
We just killed my daughter's
favorite horse.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.059
What am I gonna do?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.628
I say you put an empty
bottle of pills in its hoof

17:43.630 --> 17:45.329
And we get
the hell out of here.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.535
Where's sam?
I got to talk to her.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.537
She went to say
good night to butterscotch.

17:52.539 --> 17:56.074
- Oh, crap.
- What's wrong?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.643
Well, here's the thing
about butterscotch.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.779
He's not doing
all that well.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.581
How can you tell?

18:03.583 --> 18:07.485
Because he's dead.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.488
Yeah, I was
with him earlier,

18:10.490 --> 18:14.358
Just petting him,
and all of a sudden,
he just died.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.627
You're lying.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.429
I always know
when you're lying.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.231
- You have a tell.
- Oh, really?

18:20.233 --> 18:22.600
- What's my tell?
- You've lied to me
for 20 years.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.735
That's your tell.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.371
Did your group do it?

18:27.373 --> 18:29.841
Oh, god.
I got to deal
with that, too.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.145
No, no, it was me.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.714
I took him out
for a ride and when
he got back, he just...

18:36.716 --> 18:38.282
Keeled over.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.417
Damn it, charlie.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.153
Sam is so attached
to that horse.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.421
This is gonna
devastate her.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.189
She's never had
to deal with death before.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.458
I know, I was kind of hoping
my dad would die first

18:47.460 --> 18:49.560
So she'd be ready
for something like this.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.733
- Hey.
- Hey, sam.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.769
- You doing okay, sweetie?
- I'm good.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.605
I just saw
butterscotch.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.540
I am
so sorry, sam.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.475
About him retiring?

19:04.477 --> 19:05.676
It's okay.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.345
I just walked him
down to the lake

19:07.347 --> 19:09.280
And we laid
on the grass

19:09.282 --> 19:11.215
And looked up
at the stars

19:11.217 --> 19:13.184
And he seemed
really happy.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.585
I'm gonna go
get ready for bed.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.288
You were just
with butterscotch?

19:17.290 --> 19:18.489
Yeah.

19:18.491 --> 19:22.160
And he walked
to the lake?

19:23.262 --> 19:25.263
Yeah.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.832
He's so beautiful

19:27.834 --> 19:30.401
And sweet.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.936
It's the best weekend
of my life.

19:40.445 --> 19:43.381
Stable boy.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.488
Hey, guys.
I got your call.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.558
I think it's great
that you all came together
to honor butterscotch.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.361
Why do bad things
happen to good horses?

20:00.866 --> 20:03.634
Who knows?
Maybe it was old age.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.536
Maybe he ate something.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.639
All we know for sure
is it was nobody's fault.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.977
Good-bye,
butterscotch.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.880
You were the glue
that held us together.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.884
Bad words.
Sorry.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.595
I'm starting to forget
what he looks like already.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.463
He was big and proud.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.765
- Oh, right.
- ( sobs )

20:38.637 --> 20:39.904
Wow.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.640
Your group really
pulled together for this.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.743
So what you're saying is

20:45.745 --> 20:48.646
My instincts to keep
the group together were right

20:48.648 --> 20:52.316
And your giant,
overeducated brain
was wrong.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.385
Possibly.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.321
Thank you.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.923
I'm really glad
you came up here.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.591
You are?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.593
Yeah, I could use
a ride home.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.863
Jen got thrown off
the property for roughing
up a stable boy.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.033
So, you wanna go
kill another horse?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.002
It's broad daylight.

21:11.004 --> 21:14.572
The best I can offer
is a piggyback ride
back to my room.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.540
( chuckles )
giddyup.
