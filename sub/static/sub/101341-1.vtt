WEBVTT

00:50.250 --> 00:51.886
So he snapped and
walked over to his horse,

00:51.919 --> 00:53.855
and got it by the ears, and
said, "Listen, you stupid horse,

00:53.888 --> 00:54.789
bring back a pasi!"

00:56.991 --> 00:58.926
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen up.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.562
As you know
this is the big fish,

01:02.596 --> 01:04.598
this is not
another low level narco bust.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.235
The department has been building
this case for a long time.

01:09.436 --> 01:13.608
Miguel Aguirre,
street name, Hades.

01:13.641 --> 01:17.210
Former member of LA's
18th Street Gang.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.848
Wanted for drug smuggling,
kidnapping, arms dealing.

01:20.882 --> 01:22.917
Basically every flavor
of trafficking in the book,

01:22.950 --> 01:24.351
you name it, he's had a taste.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.288
Two weeks ago, he was
hiding in plain sight downtown,

01:28.321 --> 01:31.659
48 hours ago,
officer Mills undercover

01:32.727 --> 01:34.361
went into the Spring Street
warehouse with him.

01:34.394 --> 01:37.799
Under no circumstances
is Aguirre to be harmed.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.734
Even if he has
a Glock aimed at your head,

01:39.767 --> 01:42.202
- you still take him alive, understood?
- Yes, sir.

01:43.638 --> 01:46.941
This is the first break in the wall
to bring down the scaesa syndicate,

01:47.875 --> 01:50.277
pull this one out and the rest
will come tumbling down.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.972
All right, let's rock this shit.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.448
Green light, people,
green light.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.324
Here we go.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.730
- All good, dawg?
- All good, man.

02:42.764 --> 02:44.331
Just, just nervous.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.666
I had to clear my head up a bit.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.001
Just in time for the party.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.803
Oh, I'm ready for a party.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.072
Come on, man.
The boss is waiting for you.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.305
Absolutely.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.451
Fucking faster!

03:17.665 --> 03:18.866
Everyone's so serious.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.638
The bad guys.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.640
Just playing with you, man.

03:26.908 --> 03:29.677
Here, <i>papi,</i> special friend.

03:40.755 --> 03:41.889
You want to taste?

03:41.923 --> 03:44.324
- No, man.
- Got to stay sharp.

03:44.859 --> 03:47.561
We didn't come here
for this type of business.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.800
Present for you, <i>papito.</i>

03:54.101 --> 03:55.670
You ever danced
with the angel before?

03:55.703 --> 03:56.904
Shit.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.008
- First time for everything, right?
- See? See?

04:01.042 --> 04:03.010
I knew I can count
on my man right here, huh?

04:03.044 --> 04:05.780
- Pop your cherry, old boy!
- Absolutely.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.987
- Holy shit!
- Yeah.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.889
- Come to your mama, <i>papi.</i>
- Get away from me.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.557
Don't blow out that shit, bro.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.827
You got to save it,
for the party later.

04:19.861 --> 04:21.361
I am the motherfucking party.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.068
Fuckers. They'll turn on me
if I don't keep them medicated.

04:27.101 --> 04:30.437
- You're damn right.
- I know you of all people understand how hard it is

04:30.470 --> 04:31.538
to get good help these days.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.110
But this one here, see
the one right there, he's loyal.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.647
<i>Es mi hermano,</i>
my <i>gringo</i> brother, you know?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.616
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.450
I'm naming my next son
after him.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.688
- Best gift I can give to anyone, right?
- Yeah.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.589
His name becomes
part of my legacy.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.728
Part of the history books,
right? Ain't that right?

04:53.761 --> 04:56.898
Man, if you ain't got loyalty,
you ain't got nothing.

04:56.931 --> 04:58.766
See? That's what I'm
saying, 100 proof, baby.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.735
- 100 proof.
- Yeah.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.971
Hey. Speaking of history books,
we got to get this deal going.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.677
How much are we talking?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.746
Five billion in product.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.048
That's some pride cheddar, man.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.516
That's
a lot of feria, shit.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.020
It's clean?

05:19.053 --> 05:20.721
Clean and fresh.

05:21.856 --> 05:23.758
Untraceable?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.526
Just got to have the man power to
push it through under the radar.

05:26.559 --> 05:29.830
I got the DEA,
Xander has got the Feds.

05:29.864 --> 05:31.832
If you want my help
I can get the local PD.

05:31.866 --> 05:32.934
Shit.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.538
I didn't
come here to waste time.

05:41.976 --> 05:43.576
Sounds like
we've got a plan then.

05:49.083 --> 05:53.586
Hannah, did you know, if you
touch the G spot and the clit

05:53.621 --> 05:56.057
at the same time, it
takes a screenshot of the pussy?

05:58.092 --> 06:00.161
No, bitch, I didn't know that.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.796
- Come on guys, let's go.
- Let's go.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.966
I'll show you my crotch later.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.149
- Wait, stop! Stop!
- No, fucking go. Let's go!

06:22.183 --> 06:23.718
I said, fucking stop!

06:23.751 --> 06:25.686
What the fuck? What?

06:25.720 --> 06:26.654
<i>Policia!</i>

06:28.122 --> 06:30.624
<i>Policia,</i> man, fucking Five-O!

06:30.658 --> 06:31.926
Motherfuckers
cannot wait two minutes?

06:31.959 --> 06:33.861
Five-O, fucking Five-O, man,
let's go!

07:02.123 --> 07:04.191
Keep on listening
to the <i>musica, hijo.</i>

07:04.225 --> 07:05.960
You don't need
to see any of this.

07:17.038 --> 07:19.306
- Got the routing digits ready, when you are.
- Let's do it.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.610
Yo, Hades, man,
we got Five-O outside.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.844
Fuck you mean?

07:23.878 --> 07:26.180
Outside, the fucking police man!

07:26.213 --> 07:27.114
Go!

07:28.916 --> 07:30.317
We got SWAT outside, man.

07:30.351 --> 07:32.253
- How many?
- I can't tell.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.754
Enough to do some damage though.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.693
Shots fired, shots fired!

07:43.064 --> 07:45.132
All right, lock the place down.
They're about to come in hard.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.834
On the artillery, now!

07:46.867 --> 07:48.269
- On it!
- Move it, boss, upstairs!

07:48.302 --> 07:49.804
Get them out on every window!

07:53.207 --> 07:54.942
Fuck you!

07:57.311 --> 08:00.147
No, this is a mistake,
nobody knew about this!

08:00.181 --> 08:02.817
- What the fuck are we supposed to do with these?
- Protect your investment.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.219
They're here, they're
got to be here by morning.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.254
We don't
give a fuck, let them come.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.326
This is not
what I signed up for.

08:21.102 --> 08:22.002
Clear!

08:29.844 --> 08:30.778
Okay.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.789
Clear!

09:03.811 --> 09:05.179
You fucking bastards!

09:06.714 --> 09:08.082
Shoot to
the right, on the right!

09:08.115 --> 09:10.317
We got a man down!
We got a man down!

09:12.486 --> 09:13.721
Son a bitch.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.459
Go, go, go!

09:22.096 --> 09:23.097
Get down.

09:27.168 --> 09:28.068
Oh, shit!

09:29.803 --> 09:31.205
Motherfuckers!

09:48.022 --> 09:49.723
Fucking bitch, fuck you!

09:50.891 --> 09:52.359
Go!

09:52.393 --> 09:53.327
Son of a bitch.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.329
Clear!

10:44.078 --> 10:45.412
Drop it, Blackjack, drop it!

10:45.446 --> 10:46.981
Cease fire, cease fire!

10:48.816 --> 10:49.850
Put it down!

10:58.859 --> 11:02.129
I knew it, I knew
you were a fucking cop!

11:08.369 --> 11:09.470
Put it down.

11:24.018 --> 11:26.920
No, you son of a bitch!

11:37.632 --> 11:40.367
These motherfuckers!

11:49.644 --> 11:50.544
Clear!

11:56.984 --> 11:58.218
Don't be scared,
what did she tell you?

11:58.252 --> 11:59.621
She tell you
something about me, huh?

11:59.654 --> 12:02.122
Huh? Scared, huh? Huh?

12:03.324 --> 12:05.326
We have a hostage,
we have a hostage!

12:06.994 --> 12:10.264
- Miguel, put him down!
- Yo, you call me Hades, motherfucker.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.866
Fuck that shit,
put the kid down! Put him down!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.902
Check this out, only one way this
shit's going to go down, homie,

12:14.935 --> 12:16.403
I'm going to slice this kid
throat like fucking butter,

12:16.437 --> 12:18.238
that's how this shit
goes down, nigger.

12:18.272 --> 12:20.507
No, it's not, not now.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.910
I'll blow your fucking head off.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.145
Yo, I die, he dies.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.482
Think about it.
Let that shit haunt you.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.885
Yeah, let my face
haunt you, man.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.887
I die, he dies.

12:35.389 --> 12:36.523
I die, he dies.

12:36.557 --> 12:37.858
- I die, he dies.
- Drop it!

12:39.694 --> 12:41.261
Don't make me pull the trigger.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.397
Don't make me kill you.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.400
Yo, I brought
you into my home, man.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.001
I introduced you to
my wife and shit, man.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.470
I was going to name
my son after you, man.

12:49.503 --> 12:50.971
Don't make me kill you!

12:52.439 --> 12:55.075
Homie, you got blood
on you now fucking anyway, here.

12:55.109 --> 12:56.678
Happy? Go die bitch.

12:56.711 --> 12:58.512
Die. Die, motherfucker, die.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.449
That's my kid, man, you think I'm
going to slice my own fucking kid, man?

13:02.483 --> 13:03.951
Nigger, what the fuck?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.452
Oh, look, he's dead,
yeah, go get him.

13:05.486 --> 13:07.087
Go get your bitch boy.

13:07.121 --> 13:08.656
Harry Charles Manson.
Nigger, hey,

13:08.690 --> 13:10.157
who's Charles Manson?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.561
Keep squirming and I'll
have to break both your wrists.

13:14.595 --> 13:18.265
I'm not American citizen,
I'll call Interpol on you.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.136
My lawyers, I'll bankrupt
everyone in your family.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.505
Heard that before.

13:34.682 --> 13:36.417
What is that?

13:36.450 --> 13:37.951
Kid's got an imagination.

13:38.686 --> 13:39.987
Coo Cooi?

13:41.422 --> 13:43.457
What does that mean, Coo Cooi?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.525
I don't really know.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:47.662 --> 13:49.396
You did good, man.

13:49.430 --> 13:50.297
Thanks.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.366
How's Mills?

13:54.101 --> 13:55.536
Bad.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.037
All right,
you guys got to head out.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.375
Whoa, wait, why?

14:01.408 --> 14:02.976
Because they said so.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.578
Oh, they said so, really?

14:04.612 --> 14:06.547
- Are we really going to do this now, sir?
- Yeah, we are.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.683
Look, this is not
the time nor place.

14:08.716 --> 14:11.452
Excuse me, I was shot at today.
Where were you?

14:11.485 --> 14:14.221
Oh, that's right, sitting
behind your fucking desk, right?

14:14.254 --> 14:17.458
Yeah, behind a desk,
doing my job.

14:18.626 --> 14:22.162
Look, I think my friend wants to
know why we have to leave.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.165
Four of these perps were
competing syndicate bosses,

14:25.199 --> 14:28.235
something big was going down,
and the Feds want in.

14:28.268 --> 14:32.372
- You got to be kidding me.
- I wish I was. Look, I'm no happier about this than you.

14:32.406 --> 14:35.008
I want a statement from
everybody as soon as possible,

14:35.042 --> 14:36.410
and forget you were ever here.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.212
A year and a half
of the department's time

14:38.245 --> 14:40.347
and a man in the hospital
and this is how it goes down.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.349
You know I don't
make the rules, Maddox.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.486
Trust me, this is just as
frustrating for us as it is for you.

14:45.519 --> 14:48.255
- It's bullshit. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.172
Cheers, fuckers.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.376
Hey, to kicking ass,
fucking shit up,

15:09.409 --> 15:12.647
and the FBI fucking it
all over in the end.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.650
- And here's to Mills.
- Oh, yeah, to Mills.

15:15.683 --> 15:17.184
To Mills.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.623
And before I forget,
there is a person here,

15:21.656 --> 15:24.157
finding it hard to
give a scumbag like me

15:24.191 --> 15:26.728
the time of day, and
consider a major life change.

15:29.563 --> 15:31.699
Fuck you. Oh!

15:31.733 --> 15:34.769
And then cheers to
modern day social standards,

15:34.802 --> 15:39.406
sexual appropriation despite you
live in the fucking dark ages.

15:40.808 --> 15:41.743
Cheers!

15:43.210 --> 15:45.412
- I love you, homeboy.
- I love you, homegirl.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.447
God, you guys
are too cute.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.751
I need to get vodka
and Red Bull, you got it.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.130
Thanks!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.535
There you go,
whisky on the rocks.

16:08.569 --> 16:10.103
Thanks, Jake.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.639
And of course, guys,
it's on the house.

16:12.807 --> 16:16.143
That's like $10,000 worth of free
drinks you've given us by now.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.512
Well, it seems like
you guys had a rough night.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.748
Yeah, it always is.

16:20.782 --> 16:23.584
Don't worry about the drinks,
shits wearing down anyway.

16:28.723 --> 16:30.557
Shit got real
back there, didn't it?

16:32.426 --> 16:35.462
It sure did, but it always does.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.864
Yeah.

16:36.898 --> 16:39.566
I knew Mills would deliver,
he's a good cop.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.871
He deserves a nice
long vacation after this.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.240
Yeah, he does.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.443
And once he pulls through

16:49.476 --> 16:51.545
he's going to go straight
into witnessed protection.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.782
Like I said,
a nice long vacation.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.622
By the way, I got those...
those papers.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.891
What papers?

17:03.925 --> 17:06.460
Those countersigned
divorce papers,

17:06.492 --> 17:08.595
my wife served me
before I came in today.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.665
Served me
like a goddamn criminal,

17:11.699 --> 17:13.567
not even like her ex husband.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.204
And I already
feel like shit today.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.571
I mean, I really feel like shit.

17:18.606 --> 17:21.340
And you look like shit,
too.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.541
So at least you match.

17:22.576 --> 17:24.646
Thanks for the pick me up, bro.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.549
So, now that
you're officially divorced.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.785
Yeah.

17:30.818 --> 17:31.719
Come here, sweetie.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.422
Welcome back to
the meat market, my friend.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.759
- Hello there.
- Oh, Jesus.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.393
Hi, hello there.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.829
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing just fine.

17:58.813 --> 17:59.914
Don't touch, dude.

18:04.819 --> 18:08.221
Would you like to dance?
Yes, I'm going to arrest you.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.824
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.

18:10.958 --> 18:11.859
What?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.295
You got big hands.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.229
Oh, yeah.

18:21.803 --> 18:22.737
Thank you.

18:23.938 --> 18:24.972
I'm sorry.

18:34.816 --> 18:35.717
Yes!

18:35.750 --> 18:37.317
Guys. Guys!

18:39.519 --> 18:40.788
Bad news.

18:40.822 --> 18:41.823
What, perp got out already?

18:43.290 --> 18:43.991
No.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.661
Mills didn't make it.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.667
Yeah, that was
the department calling.

18:57.071 --> 19:00.273
Final toast, to brother Mills.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.610
May he rest in peace.

19:03.745 --> 19:04.779
To Mills.

19:10.985 --> 19:12.820
Godspeed, brother.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.578
<i>We've got
seismic activities.</i>

19:54.662 --> 19:56.463
Hey, Vern.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.865
Hey.

19:57.899 --> 19:59.700
Did you tie one on last night?

20:02.737 --> 20:03.938
Yeah.

20:03.971 --> 20:05.338
And you didn't call me?

20:06.974 --> 20:08.943
- I should have.
- You should have.

20:10.077 --> 20:11.746
Well, he's just
finishing up with a patient.

20:11.779 --> 20:12.914
He'll be with you shortly.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.449
- Super.
- <i>Ground reports of unusual weather</i>

Sorry, I had an emergency early.

20:40.775 --> 20:43.343
Oh, that's all right.
I'm not going anywhere.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.113
How's work been?

20:47.514 --> 20:50.417
Well, people are
still trying to kill me.

20:51.652 --> 20:54.055
I guess it's too late to tell
you about my malpractice lawsuit.

20:55.990 --> 20:58.025
Sorry, still no sleep?

20:59.126 --> 21:04.397
No. I just can't get used
to being in the house by myself,

21:04.431 --> 21:07.969
you know, I'm just, uh,
just restless.

21:08.002 --> 21:10.771
I mean, if I can work
24-hour shifts, I would.

21:10.805 --> 21:12.840
That's about what
I end up working here.

21:12.874 --> 21:15.776
See, that's the good life.

21:15.810 --> 21:17.845
Good life. See?

21:20.214 --> 21:21.548
Ah. Sorry.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.554
Sorry about that.

21:29.023 --> 21:33.094
So, what's going on, I mean...

21:34.228 --> 21:35.763
Got your blood work results.

21:36.697 --> 21:38.933
Let me guess, too much red meat.

21:38.966 --> 21:39.867
Possibly.

21:41.135 --> 21:44.639
You know, I had a vegan try to
kill me once, still can't do it.

21:46.007 --> 21:46.908
Have a look.

21:49.810 --> 21:50.711
Okay.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.652
I'm not sure
what I'm looking at.

21:57.685 --> 21:59.720
- It's cancer, Vernon.
- What?

21:59.754 --> 22:01.789
Myeloma, it's
a type of blood cancer...

22:01.822 --> 22:03.858
I know what myeloma is.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.162
Luckily it's early,
there are no symptoms yet.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.866
Look, when can
we start treatment?

22:11.899 --> 22:14.434
I'll bring you in
every three or four weeks.

22:15.236 --> 22:16.971
It's... We'll go from there.

22:18.471 --> 22:22.009
- Chances of survival are...
- I know what the prognosis is, and it's bad.

22:24.645 --> 22:25.980
When can we start?

22:26.013 --> 22:28.149
Well, we're not
going to do anything yet.

22:28.182 --> 22:30.251
I would put you on chemo,
but there's only

22:30.284 --> 22:34.121
a very small percentage
of survival rate on that.

22:34.155 --> 22:36.657
I've been studying
this for 20 years and I've had

22:36.691 --> 22:39.627
some fortune with some studies
that were done in China.

22:50.671 --> 22:52.239
What the hell was that?

22:52.273 --> 22:54.942
You tell me, I can't
drive after some tequila,

22:54.976 --> 22:56.744
with this kind of
shit happening on the road?

22:56.777 --> 23:00.214
Shut up, man! I'm getting
tired of your fucking shit.

23:00.247 --> 23:03.884
Hey, Hey. Hey. I'm just saying.

23:03.918 --> 23:05.552
I'm just saying.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.988
Why does all
the crazy shit got to happen

23:07.021 --> 23:08.856
at the end of the shift?

23:08.889 --> 23:09.957
I'm going to call it in.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.194
Dispatch,
this is officer Hanson.

23:13.227 --> 23:15.963
It looks like we got
a weird electrical disturbance

23:15.997 --> 23:18.299
- over by Gates Canyon.
- <i>Copy that officer.</i>

23:18.332 --> 23:20.835
- <i>Check in when you have visual.</i>
- Copy that.

23:20.868 --> 23:22.136
When we have visual?

23:23.070 --> 23:25.272
I think we already have visual.

23:25.306 --> 23:29.176
Seriously, man, we don't got nothing
until something jumps out of this.

23:29.210 --> 23:32.279
I think a fucking lightning
bolt just jumped out at us.

23:32.313 --> 23:34.815
It's two hours before our shift
ends, you're going to start?

23:34.849 --> 23:36.684
Is your blood sugar low
or something?

23:36.717 --> 23:38.919
Look, I had my protein shake
before I came in, all right?

23:38.953 --> 23:40.755
That shit fucks with
your head, you know that, right?

23:41.689 --> 23:44.557
Lovely, lovely, lover's quarrel.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.227
Hey, shut up!

23:48.763 --> 23:50.297
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

23:50.331 --> 23:53.334
That's... unusual.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.102
Seriously?

23:56.137 --> 23:58.039
Dispatch, do you read me?

23:58.072 --> 24:00.608
Do any units out there read me?
This is Hanson.

24:01.342 --> 24:03.077
Jesus.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.745
Your turn?

24:04.779 --> 24:06.847
I don't think
Jesus wants a turn.

24:06.881 --> 24:11.118
Look, I took the last one,
this one... all yours.

24:11.152 --> 24:14.922
All right,
that 70-year old prostitute.

24:14.955 --> 24:18.993
75, and you owe me
big time for that shit.

24:19.026 --> 24:22.630
75 years old. I mean,
that's got to be a record.

24:22.663 --> 24:24.632
Look, when we're done here,

24:24.665 --> 24:26.367
I'm getting another unit
to take this guy.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.903
- Cool, bro, cool.
- Good.

24:28.936 --> 24:31.105
Seriously,
you guys are like the worst cops

24:31.138 --> 24:33.274
in the entire planet, I swear.

24:35.276 --> 24:36.310
Watch yourself.

24:43.818 --> 24:46.120
I think maybe you should
probably go with him, man.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.222
I think you should
hold his hand.

24:48.255 --> 24:51.292
Shut up! Shut up
or I'm going to handcuff you

24:51.325 --> 24:53.294
to a fucking
cactus out here, man.

24:55.963 --> 24:58.833
What in the actual fuck?

25:03.204 --> 25:07.108
Dispatch. This is Hanson,
does anybody read me?

25:19.053 --> 25:20.888
- Fuck!
- Is that the fucking satellite?

25:20.921 --> 25:22.890
I don't fucking know, man,
let's just go!

25:22.923 --> 25:25.059
Oh, shit!

25:25.092 --> 25:28.362
Oh, shit, man, come on! Get me
out of here! Oh, shit, man!

25:28.395 --> 25:29.864
Get me out of here, man,
come on!

25:29.897 --> 25:32.066
Get these fucking
handcuffs off of me!

25:32.099 --> 25:34.034
Come on! Get me out of here!

25:49.984 --> 25:53.020
<i>...there are no such
things, but something big...</i>

25:53.988 --> 25:57.958
<i>something that made it through
the earth's atmosphere intact</i>

26:01.996 --> 26:02.930
You're late.

26:04.331 --> 26:05.332
I tried calling.

26:06.934 --> 26:09.203
I'll fill you in later.
What's up?

26:10.304 --> 26:12.206
Last minute request
from the Feds.

26:14.141 --> 26:15.976
- Suit up.
- All right.

26:16.010 --> 26:18.212
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, ready to rock and roll, sir.

26:18.245 --> 26:21.081
<i>So this morning threats
came in on Miguel Aguirre's life,</i>

26:21.115 --> 26:24.418
<i>not the typical social media
bullshit, the real deal.</i>

26:24.451 --> 26:26.253
<i>I thought
the Feds were handling that.</i>

26:26.287 --> 26:28.155
<i>Yeah, well, they
specifically requested us</i>

26:28.189 --> 26:31.725
to move him to county and keep
him on a 24-hour watch.

26:31.759 --> 26:33.961
- There's cartel in the county.
- Yeah.

26:33.994 --> 26:36.430
<i>I've got eyes in the sky, boys.</i>

26:37.331 --> 26:38.999
<i>Eyes in the sky.</i>

26:39.033 --> 26:40.234
Keep him in sight.

26:43.971 --> 26:45.406
Hey, hey.

26:45.439 --> 26:48.075
How you been?
Come on, bring it, baby.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.877
You're back in your
fucking element, aren't you?

26:49.910 --> 26:50.911
- Huh?
- I missed you, man.

26:50.945 --> 26:51.946
Yeah, I missed you too.

26:53.547 --> 26:55.249
Nothing like the smell
of middle aged testosterone

26:55.282 --> 26:56.250
in the morning.

26:58.185 --> 27:00.521
Agent Caprice, FBI.

27:00.554 --> 27:03.090
I'm going to be accompanying
you on this little adventure.

27:03.123 --> 27:04.091
I don't think so.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.360
Feds do not ride with us.

27:09.029 --> 27:11.165
<i>Yeah, check in five,
boys, can you confirm that?</i>

27:12.299 --> 27:14.168
So you're the heroes?

27:14.201 --> 27:16.036
Who are you looking for, Mills?

27:16.070 --> 27:17.538
Can't wait to meet him.

27:17.571 --> 27:19.206
I'm sure you can't.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.941
Where is he?

27:20.975 --> 27:21.909
He's in the morgue.

27:24.044 --> 27:26.780
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure that makes him feel much better.

27:27.848 --> 27:28.916
Let's get out of here.

27:29.817 --> 27:32.052
Eyes on the prize, coming out.

27:32.086 --> 27:34.288
<i>Keep the chatter down in
case someone hacks the channel.</i>

27:34.321 --> 27:35.256

<i>ETA, five minutes.</i>

27:57.578 --> 28:01.015

What the hell?

28:05.119 --> 28:06.253
What is all this?

28:07.955 --> 28:08.956
God.

28:10.524 --> 28:11.792
I don't get it.

28:17.931 --> 28:18.966
What's happening?

28:32.880 --> 28:35.215
Don't they teach you to make
calm in situations like this?

28:39.553 --> 28:41.555
Let's say I had a gun stashed.

28:42.956 --> 28:44.558
Or shit, a grenade.

28:44.591 --> 28:46.427
I pull the pin,
you're going to make calm then?

28:50.364 --> 28:53.033
Or what if my boys offed
another one of you

28:53.067 --> 28:55.336
all like that snitch
motherfucker last night?

28:55.369 --> 28:56.970
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!

28:57.004 --> 28:59.340
Hey, come on,
he wants you to do this.

28:59.373 --> 29:01.141
He wants you to do this.
Calm down.

29:01.175 --> 29:02.843
- Calm down.
- Calm the fuck down.

29:05.346 --> 29:07.981
- Easy, come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:08.015 --> 29:12.052
That's what I want to see. Yeah, yeah, that's
what I want to see, some real cop shit.

29:12.086 --> 29:14.188
The kind of cop shit
that gets you on the news,

29:14.221 --> 29:17.024
and all over
social media, yeah, yeah.

29:21.095 --> 29:23.063
<i>This just in,

What is that?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.315
- Can you see it?
- I see it.

29:42.349 --> 29:44.351
You see this
from the office, right?

29:47.087 --> 29:48.522
Hey, look at this!

29:48.555 --> 29:50.591
You're throwing
off my vibes, Coli.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.159
I said, look at this!

30:00.300 --> 30:02.202
Yo what's up, everyone,
it's Dallas.

30:02.236 --> 30:04.606

Vivid entertain...

30:20.487 --> 30:24.558
And also, an alien invasion.
Oh, shit!

30:28.395 --> 30:30.632
<i>Guys, I'm getting some
interference with the radio.</i>

30:36.136 --> 30:37.104
What the fuck happened?

30:37.137 --> 30:38.405
Shh!

30:41.609 --> 30:43.678

anti-aircraft weapons now?

Buddies of yours?

30:47.247 --> 30:48.716
Boom.

30:55.255 --> 30:58.258
No. Fuck, I missed my pudding.

31:00.127 --> 31:02.463
- Oh, what the hell, assholes?
- I'm sorry.

31:02.496 --> 31:04.565
You're very sorry,
you son of a bitch.

31:04.598 --> 31:06.701
Hey, hey, let me in!

31:06.734 --> 31:07.702
No, no, no, no.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.338
Drive, drive!
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:11.371 --> 31:13.708
- Who are you?
- Hey, just drive! Drive!

31:13.741 --> 31:16.678
- Lady, get out of my car.
- I'm going to push you right into traffic if you don't drive.

31:16.711 --> 31:18.780
- I think you better do what she says, man.
- Go!

31:18.813 --> 31:20.514
Okay, fine! Fine!

31:20.547 --> 31:21.783
Just drive!

31:21.816 --> 31:23.217
Motherfucker!

31:31.391 --> 31:33.227
Dammit, no, no, no!

31:33.260 --> 31:35.329
- What is it?
- The van's dead.

31:35.362 --> 31:37.331
- What do you mean the van's dead?
- It's dead.

31:37.364 --> 31:38.432
Well, make it undead then.

31:38.465 --> 31:39.533
I'm trying.

31:40.434 --> 31:42.035
You
don't know how to drive.

31:42.069 --> 31:45.305
Oh! Stop hitting me.
Stop hitting me, lady.

31:45.339 --> 31:48.475
- You're going to get us killed.
- First of all, that thing's what's going to get us killed.

31:52.814 --> 31:55.683
Jesus Christ. Shit. Shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

31:55.717 --> 31:58.218
Stop cursing,
it's fucking judgment day.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.089
Dammit, hold on
to something and pray.

32:06.159 --> 32:08.362
Come on, man, you've got it.
Come on, you've got this.

32:13.768 --> 32:16.638
It's been a good life.
I'm coming, Rito,

32:16.671 --> 32:18.338
I'm coming up to see you, Rito.

32:21.508 --> 32:24.812
Not today, Satan. Not today.

32:24.846 --> 32:26.246
What the hell are you doing?

32:50.772 --> 32:52.640
Atul? Atul!

32:53.574 --> 32:54.474
Shit.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.583
What the fuck happened?

33:02.617 --> 33:04.318
I don't know.

33:04.351 --> 33:05.787
Everyone all right?

33:05.820 --> 33:07.722
Yeah, anybody hurt?

33:08.756 --> 33:09.757
Just my feelings.

33:09.791 --> 33:10.758
Cargo good?

33:10.792 --> 33:12.426
I'm going on, baby.

33:12.459 --> 33:13.460
Yeah, whatever.

33:14.629 --> 33:16.698
Any idea what happened?

33:16.731 --> 33:18.733
Someone had to have hit us.

33:18.766 --> 33:22.202
If they did it wasn't
explosives, something else.

33:22.235 --> 33:24.271
Snipers maybe,
blew out the tires?

33:25.907 --> 33:27.574
No, the choppers
would have seen it.

33:27.609 --> 33:29.343
I'm pretty sure
the chopper went down.

33:30.612 --> 33:32.245
No signal. Anybody else?

33:34.448 --> 33:35.449
I got nothing.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.318
911's down too.

33:38.352 --> 33:39.353
Shit.

33:53.801 --> 33:54.702
Fuck!

33:57.404 --> 33:59.741
You want it? Come on!

34:10.717 --> 34:12.252
What the hell is going on?

34:18.324 --> 34:19.493
Oh, shit, man.

34:20.795 --> 34:22.161
The tires are intact.

34:30.672 --> 34:31.839
The snipers maybe?

34:33.007 --> 34:35.909
No. It's not a bullet wound.

34:37.511 --> 34:40.313
Hey, man, you can't help
a brother out?

34:41.649 --> 34:43.350
What?

34:43.382 --> 34:44.551
A tooth.

34:55.529 --> 34:58.265
You know what? I think I'm going
to start calling you tooth fairy.

34:58.298 --> 34:59.499
Yeah.

35:08.876 --> 35:11.211
How's that for
a motherfucking tooth fairy?

35:13.981 --> 35:16.450
This doesn't make sense.

35:16.483 --> 35:19.620
If someone's trying to take us down,
then what happened to everything else?

35:19.654 --> 35:21.989
No, I don't think
this was planned.

35:23.423 --> 35:24.625
Come on, let's get out of here.

35:29.296 --> 35:31.833
Holy Mary Mother of God.

35:31.866 --> 35:32.834
What?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.937
Up, man. Look up.

35:38.572 --> 35:39.573
That's no cartel.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.409
No, it's not.

35:46.881 --> 35:48.548
Let's get out of here.

35:48.582 --> 35:49.884
Let's go, we got to move.
Come on!

35:49.917 --> 35:51.686
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go!

35:52.954 --> 35:54.021
Come on.

35:55.589 --> 35:57.557
It's four blocks to the county,
and we're going to hotfoot it over there,

35:57.591 --> 36:00.293
- come on.
- What the fuck is that?

36:00.327 --> 36:01.796
The hell does it
look like, homeboy?

36:01.829 --> 36:03.530
Come on, people, we got to move!

36:03.563 --> 36:05.565
Hey, we got to help
these people though, right?

36:05.599 --> 36:07.267
There's no time, we got to go.

36:22.083 --> 36:23.785
Left! Left! Left!

36:25.787 --> 36:26.754
Move!

36:26.788 --> 36:28.421
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

36:28.455 --> 36:29.556
Move!

36:29.589 --> 36:30.658
Run, run!

36:33.961 --> 36:35.062
Go, go, go, go!

36:35.096 --> 36:36.931
Pick it up! Come on, go.

36:36.964 --> 36:39.700
- They're catching up!
- Come on! Go, go!

36:39.734 --> 36:41.803
- Come on!
- Bullets aren't doing anything.

36:41.836 --> 36:42.737
Pick it up!

36:48.075 --> 36:50.044
Hustle, hustle, come on!

36:50.077 --> 36:51.813
Go, go, go, go!

36:51.846 --> 36:53.513
SWAT, SWAT, SWAT, SWAT!

36:54.649 --> 36:55.582
Go, go, go!

37:02.156 --> 37:03.323
It's locked.

37:07.527 --> 37:09.596
You're going to let them in?

37:09.630 --> 37:12.599
No, let them figure it out
for themselves.

37:12.633 --> 37:13.567
All right, back it up.

37:16.436 --> 37:17.638
They could have just knocked.

37:19.874 --> 37:21.843
- Clear!
- Go, go, go!

37:22.743 --> 37:23.711
Get in here.

37:37.457 --> 37:38.458
- Whoa!
- Fuck!

37:38.491 --> 37:39.894
- Shit!
- Ah!

37:39.927 --> 37:41.696
- Oh, my God!
- I got you. I got you.

37:42.830 --> 37:43.998
- I fucking got you.
- Oh, my God!

37:48.703 --> 37:50.437
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:50.470 --> 37:51.806
Don't let go.

37:53.608 --> 37:55.142
No!

38:02.116 --> 38:03.818
Fuck.

38:10.725 --> 38:11.926
Jesus Christ!

38:11.959 --> 38:13.661
Fuck, what the hell is that?

38:13.694 --> 38:15.663
- It looks like my mother's vagina.
- Shut up!

38:15.696 --> 38:17.497
The fuck?

38:17.530 --> 38:19.166
Close that goddamn thing out.

38:27.474 --> 38:28.910
What the fuck is that thing?

38:31.846 --> 38:33.814
What the fuck are you?

38:36.617 --> 38:38.085
It does kind of look like vivid.

38:38.119 --> 38:39.654
Just like Vivid.

38:39.687 --> 38:40.922
You think
this is a joke, huh?

38:42.390 --> 38:45.626
You think it's funny? People are
dying out there, you understand?

38:45.660 --> 38:47.494
- Okay, I understand.
- What the fuck is that?

38:48.495 --> 38:50.563
What the fuck is going on here?

38:50.597 --> 38:52.066
Fucking serpent.

38:52.099 --> 38:54.068
You saw that thing
in the sky, right?

38:54.101 --> 38:55.535
That's impossible.

38:55.568 --> 38:56.938
You saw it
just like I did.

38:56.971 --> 38:58.039
That's fucking impossible!

38:58.072 --> 38:59.572
You saw what happened, man!

38:59.607 --> 39:00.808
Fucking aliens!

39:01.742 --> 39:04.577
Actual fucking aliens, man.

39:04.612 --> 39:07.882
That's right,
that's what's in the sky.

39:07.915 --> 39:10.952
Knocked out cell towers
and broadcast capabilities.

39:10.985 --> 39:12.987
Yeah, they knocked out cars too.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.622
We closed the doors
so we didn't get mobbed.

39:18.025 --> 39:20.094
Is this the only
civilian you let in?

39:20.127 --> 39:21.662
Jesus.

39:21.696 --> 39:22.930
You didn't let any more in?

39:22.964 --> 39:25.232
- No. Yup.
- That's it?

39:25.266 --> 39:27.802
Hendrix here is
a little bit anxious.

39:29.103 --> 39:32.006
So, you brought the delivery.

39:32.039 --> 39:33.641
Yeah.

39:33.674 --> 39:35.209
Put him in a cell.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.778
The rest of this place
is like a bank vault,

39:37.812 --> 39:39.981
but we got to figure out how
to seal off these front doors.

39:41.882 --> 39:44.819
People, listen.
I know we got hit hard,

39:44.852 --> 39:46.721
but we need to be ready
in case more of these things

39:46.754 --> 39:48.555
show up, got it?

39:48.588 --> 39:50.091
- Got it.
- Yeah, I got it.

39:53.995 --> 39:55.796
So what's your story?

39:55.830 --> 39:57.031
I'm a tourist.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.934
You got any training?

39:59.967 --> 40:02.636
I got second place in
a <i>Street Fighter</i> tournament.

40:02.670 --> 40:04.872
So you're good with hand to
hand, how about firearms,

40:04.905 --> 40:06.640
any weapons?

40:06.674 --> 40:08.575
I didn't place in
a <i>Mortal Combat</i> tournament.

40:08.609 --> 40:09.576
Wait, what?

40:10.478 --> 40:11.578
Oh, you mean in person,
like for real?

40:14.348 --> 40:16.951
I took Taekwondo in elementary
school, if that counts.

40:16.984 --> 40:20.121
Everyone took Taekwondo
in elementary.

40:20.154 --> 40:21.222
So you're worthless.

40:22.323 --> 40:23.824
I'm a podcaster from Texas.

40:23.858 --> 40:26.160
It's not
a real fucking job.

40:26.193 --> 40:28.929
Anyway, Let's drop the cargo,
come on. Let's go.

40:39.273 --> 40:40.875
Fresh meat.

40:40.908 --> 40:42.343
Fresh meat!

40:42.376 --> 40:43.844
Fresh meat!

40:43.878 --> 40:45.046
Fresh meat!

40:45.079 --> 40:47.580
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!

40:47.615 --> 40:49.750
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!

40:49.784 --> 40:51.285
Fresh meat! Fresh meat!

40:51.318 --> 40:53.054
Let us
the fuck out of here!

40:54.155 --> 40:57.590
Oh, here to
keep me company, huh?

41:02.830 --> 41:04.832
Open number three.

41:22.716 --> 41:25.319
Cartel in here won't
let your boy sit easy.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.888
He's not ours,
he's property of the FBI.

41:29.824 --> 41:31.158
Prisoners know what's going on?

41:32.159 --> 41:34.662
As far as they know,
its an earthquake.

41:34.695 --> 41:36.263
We tell them what's out there
and they might get

41:36.297 --> 41:38.999
real Catholic real fast.

41:39.033 --> 41:41.802
I prefer them
the way they are now.

41:41.836 --> 41:42.770
I'm Catholic.

41:44.238 --> 41:45.673
Nobody's perfect.

41:51.278 --> 41:53.180
Home, sweet home.

41:56.317 --> 41:58.619
I heard Mills
played you really good.

42:02.423 --> 42:04.058
Hey, you know what? Do you...

42:05.092 --> 42:08.829
Hey, Miguel,
do you like... coloring books?

42:10.164 --> 42:12.032
The fuck you mean
coloring books?

42:12.066 --> 42:14.935
You know, coloring books.
We were at your house...

42:16.270 --> 42:18.005
cleaning the mess up and...

42:19.306 --> 42:21.242
the girl's kid
was drawing a picture...

42:22.409 --> 42:25.079
it kind of looked
like that thing back there.

42:27.982 --> 42:30.151
It said Coo Cooi.

42:30.184 --> 42:32.253
- Coo Cooi?
- Coo Cooi.

42:34.788 --> 42:36.223
I know the neighborhood
kids use it,

42:36.257 --> 42:39.260
around Halloween,
that name, it means a monster.

42:43.297 --> 42:45.432
You know what, man,
it's funny, man, life's funny.

42:46.734 --> 42:48.169
I thought I was the monster.

42:51.772 --> 42:52.806
I don't know shit.

42:54.208 --> 42:55.409
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

42:58.445 --> 42:59.947
Always a pleasure.

42:59.980 --> 43:00.915
Let's go.

43:07.821 --> 43:11.225
You got an analog radio
or ham radio, anything?

43:11.258 --> 43:12.826
None that are working.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.962
My comadre can fix it.

43:14.995 --> 43:16.897
Be my guest.

43:16.931 --> 43:20.401
I don't think radio shack's open
if she needs any parts.

43:20.434 --> 43:21.735
She'll be fine.

43:32.913 --> 43:35.749
What the fuck's going
on outside there, pigs, huh?

43:36.483 --> 43:38.385
Sounds like
a building going down.

43:45.993 --> 43:47.361
It might be safer outside.

43:48.395 --> 43:50.130
Let's move.

43:50.164 --> 43:52.533
You feel safe? Let me
out of here, I'll skull fuck

43:52.566 --> 43:55.169
every goddamn one
of you with a baseball bat!

43:55.202 --> 43:56.470
Can you do me too?

43:56.503 --> 43:57.805
Can you do me too, bro?

43:57.838 --> 43:59.773
Move it along motherfucker!

43:59.807 --> 44:02.209
I'll take a baseball bat
and shove it up your ass!

44:02.243 --> 44:04.111
Kentucky style.

44:04.144 --> 44:06.947
Bitch!
You like that shit, huh?

44:06.981 --> 44:08.382
Let me
the fuck out of here!

44:08.415 --> 44:11.151
Huh?
You like that? You hear me?

44:40.615 --> 44:41.815
You good, man?

44:44.485 --> 44:46.453
You want to know if he's good?

44:46.487 --> 44:47.955
He said something was up?

44:49.890 --> 44:52.092
Yeah, I don't know
if now's a good time.

45:06.608 --> 45:08.042
Is it the ex wife?

45:15.582 --> 45:19.486
I, I went to the... doctor's
to get the results

45:19.520 --> 45:21.121
of my physical this morning.

45:23.658 --> 45:24.892
I have cancer.

45:26.226 --> 45:27.328
You're kidding me.

45:29.263 --> 45:30.597
Shit, Vernon.

45:33.467 --> 45:34.501
Yeah, it's, uh...

45:36.503 --> 45:38.972
myeloma. It's a, it's a...

45:40.040 --> 45:41.075
blood cancer.

45:43.077 --> 45:46.280
The survival rate is not good.

45:48.015 --> 45:49.116
I don't know what to say.

45:51.352 --> 45:53.587
You know what, brother,
you don't have to say anything.

45:54.656 --> 45:59.627
I mean, it's, uh,
it's my reward for...

45:59.661 --> 46:01.528
for a lifetime
in public service.

46:02.563 --> 46:05.232
Okay, we got to get you out
of here, we got to do something.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.003
You know what, let's just keep
it between our selves right now,

46:10.037 --> 46:11.939
I don't want
anyone else to know.

46:12.707 --> 46:16.210
I'll tell them when
the time's right, all right?

46:17.578 --> 46:18.512
Absolutely.

46:19.614 --> 46:20.514
Of course.

46:21.415 --> 46:22.316
Thank you.

46:34.495 --> 46:36.563
- That's all we got.
- All right. I don't know the last time

46:36.597 --> 46:38.599
anybody used these.

46:38.633 --> 46:40.367
That is not a fucking joystick.

46:41.435 --> 46:43.470
All right, we got two riot guns.

46:43.504 --> 46:47.675
We've got, uh, four
or five Glocks, extra clips,

46:47.709 --> 46:51.111
flume grenade, got some knives,

46:51.145 --> 46:52.579
we got some tear gas,

46:52.614 --> 46:55.149
and every coed's favorite...

46:56.216 --> 46:57.685
pepper spray.

46:57.719 --> 46:59.721
I'm not sure that
will be too effective.

46:59.754 --> 47:02.222
You know what,
you don't know until you try.

47:02.256 --> 47:04.024
Yeah. Right.

47:04.057 --> 47:04.726
Agreed.

47:04.759 --> 47:05.693
Totally agree.

47:07.027 --> 47:08.595
So is this all we got?

47:08.630 --> 47:10.998
This is a jail house,
not a police armory.

47:11.031 --> 47:12.332
You have
cartel in here.

47:12.366 --> 47:13.534
It's
not our decision, man.

47:13.567 --> 47:14.435
We don't run the city.

47:14.468 --> 47:16.069
You may need the assist
if one of them

47:16.103 --> 47:17.605
manages to break out.

47:17.639 --> 47:20.140
We don't want cartel to get
any heavy artillery,

47:20.174 --> 47:21.542
now do we?

47:21.575 --> 47:23.711
It's like he said,
it's not our decision.

47:23.745 --> 47:26.046
Way above our pay grade, bro.

47:26.079 --> 47:27.581
How's everyone ammo?

47:27.615 --> 47:31.351
Not good, wasted bullets
on those things getting in here.

47:31.385 --> 47:32.486
Down a clip and a half.

47:35.355 --> 47:37.491
Hopefully these knives
can do some damage.

47:37.524 --> 47:39.560
We just got to make
sure every shot counts.

47:39.593 --> 47:41.995
That's going to be hard
to do when we don't really know

47:42.029 --> 47:44.198
what we're dealing with,
and our numbers are down.

47:44.231 --> 47:46.500
And in a place full of people
who don't want us here.

47:46.533 --> 47:49.303
I'm sure if we stay in here
long enough, they'll get in.

47:49.336 --> 47:51.138
We need to move
on to something else.

47:51.171 --> 47:52.640
That's why I want
to get that radio fixed.

47:52.674 --> 47:55.275
- Can I get you on that, comadre?
- Definitely.

47:55.309 --> 47:57.377
C-Los, Kai,
let's get you two on the roof.

47:57.411 --> 47:59.246
See what the damage
is outside these walls,

47:59.279 --> 48:01.181
and we can
figure out our next move.

48:01.215 --> 48:02.282
- Affirmative.
- Copy that.

48:02.316 --> 48:04.117
Lee, go with them.

48:04.151 --> 48:06.386
They can't cover
the whole roof alone.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.588
No problem.

48:07.622 --> 48:08.790
Thank you.

48:08.823 --> 48:10.658
What about me? I'm useful.

48:10.692 --> 48:13.494
Why don't you go play
some fucking <i>Punch-Out!!</i> ?

48:13.527 --> 48:15.562
<i>Punch-Out!!</i>
I love <i>Punch-Out!!</i> My Ninja.

48:15.596 --> 48:18.565
No. Just no.

48:19.566 --> 48:21.435
All right, people,
let's move.

48:21.468 --> 48:23.103
- Let's go.
- Put all that ammo in that bag.

48:23.136 --> 48:24.037
Yes, sir.

49:33.608 --> 49:35.375
How does it look?

49:35.409 --> 49:37.144
I don't know.

49:37.177 --> 49:38.478
I got to check it out first.

49:39.914 --> 49:40.815
Well, let me know.

49:44.418 --> 49:45.385
Hey.

49:49.256 --> 49:50.223
Hey.

49:51.191 --> 49:52.794
I know it's tough,
but we got to keep moving

49:52.827 --> 49:55.295
until we get a handle on this.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.464
Tobias was like
family to me too.

49:58.398 --> 50:00.233
But we got to keep
that mourning in check.

50:02.804 --> 50:03.738
Yeah.

50:05.873 --> 50:07.675
He was my dip shit
little brother.

50:10.745 --> 50:11.713
I'll miss him.

50:13.715 --> 50:15.750
Yeah, me too.

50:24.959 --> 50:27.160
I'm going to go back downstairs.

50:27.194 --> 50:29.664
No, you're not.
Your boss gave you orders.

50:29.697 --> 50:31.799
You're one of us now. Cool?

50:33.367 --> 50:34.869
Yeah.

50:34.902 --> 50:35.803
I'm cool.

50:36.938 --> 50:37.839
Good.

50:46.279 --> 50:47.347
Shit.

50:53.286 --> 50:54.454
All right, all right.

50:55.690 --> 50:57.190
Now we're getting somewhere.

51:03.263 --> 51:05.465
Fuck, yes.

51:05.499 --> 51:06.734
Oh, I still got it.

51:13.675 --> 51:15.542
If anyone
can hear me out there...

51:16.576 --> 51:20.748
this is officer Hannah Paulson,
we're in the county jail.

51:22.016 --> 51:25.285
We have few survivors,
and we're low on ammo.

51:26.721 --> 51:30.557
If anybody can hear me, we'll sure
as shit be grateful for the help.

51:37.364 --> 51:40.702
So we just sit here
and watch the world burn.

51:42.335 --> 51:43.437
It's not in my DNA.

51:44.972 --> 51:47.975
Not in mine either,
but now we just got to sit tight

51:48.009 --> 51:49.276
and survive.

51:53.614 --> 51:55.883
Guys. Guys.

51:56.951 --> 51:59.654
<i>The situation is
apocalyptical out here, fellas.</i>

51:59.687 --> 52:00.788
<i>Stay safe down there.</i>

52:01.756 --> 52:03.791
Jesus shown up yet?

52:03.825 --> 52:05.392
Nada de nada, señor.

52:06.326 --> 52:07.729
<i>We got fires all around.</i>

52:09.529 --> 52:11.465
There's fires all around?

52:11.498 --> 52:12.633
<i>There's no way out.</i>

52:13.868 --> 52:16.303
- <i>At least not by ground.</i>
- Jeez.

52:16.336 --> 52:18.572
All right.
Well, stay safe out there.

52:18.606 --> 52:19.941
<i>I might
be ready to pray.</i>

52:21.909 --> 52:24.679
Okay, so here's plan B.

52:24.712 --> 52:28.448
Communications and transportation
are both knocked out.

52:29.449 --> 52:30.618
What's the goal?

52:31.585 --> 52:32.687
It's the end of the world?

52:34.321 --> 52:35.255
No.

52:36.523 --> 52:38.525
It's psychological warfare.

52:39.426 --> 52:41.963
Paranoia, desperation.

52:41.996 --> 52:45.532
Right. People are
strapped to their phones nowadays.

52:45.565 --> 52:48.836
Take them away and they panic, they
don't know a world without them anymore.

52:48.870 --> 52:50.605
Yeah, like I said,
the end of the world.

52:50.638 --> 52:52.539
- Agreed.
- See? she gets it.

52:53.540 --> 52:55.676
So what's the end game?

52:57.544 --> 52:58.846
They're watching us.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.681
Yeah, but what's
going on in their heads?

53:02.750 --> 53:07.354
Weakness,
vulnerability, desperation.

53:07.387 --> 53:08.990
They're exposing our handicap.

53:09.023 --> 53:11.893
Exactly that. Finally
you say something useful.

53:14.427 --> 53:16.764
Before cell phones
and the internet,

53:16.798 --> 53:20.668
people were generally more self
sufficient, something's broke you fix it.

53:20.701 --> 53:22.904
No phone,
you knock on someone's door.

53:22.937 --> 53:26.107
They're going to sweep this
building if they haven't already.

53:26.140 --> 53:29.576
- We need to be mobile, and not just for your sake.
- Right.

53:29.610 --> 53:30.945
What's so special about him?

53:31.846 --> 53:32.747
We just got to go.

53:34.048 --> 53:37.450
All right, look, I see that I'm
not your favorite person here,

53:37.484 --> 53:39.754
and for the record,
I'm not disagreeing with you.

53:39.787 --> 53:41.521
But none of the vehicles work.

53:42.589 --> 53:44.625
You know what, we find out more

53:44.659 --> 53:46.894
about what
we're fighting against.

53:46.928 --> 53:48.428
And how do you
suppose we do that?

53:50.164 --> 53:51.065
The cargo.

53:52.033 --> 53:53.801
- Cargo?
- Yeah.

53:54.902 --> 53:55.803
Yup.

54:02.542 --> 54:04.544
What, you don't
think I look sexy?

54:04.578 --> 54:07.380
You remind me of that
greasy looking sasquatch,

54:07.414 --> 54:08.816
that booked me, boy.

54:16.691 --> 54:19.961
I told you earlier,
I don't have shit to say to you.

54:21.162 --> 54:22.763
I just came by just to...

54:23.731 --> 54:24.665
say hi.

54:25.833 --> 54:27.668
- Did you miss me?
- Oh, yeah.

54:29.637 --> 54:31.672
Yeah. Yeah, I missed you too.

54:34.574 --> 54:37.812
You know what, boys,
this guy's about ready to snitch...

54:41.514 --> 54:43.516
and I know how
you boys love snitches.

54:44.919 --> 54:46.553
You recognize this fool?

54:47.587 --> 54:48.623
I recognize him.

54:50.490 --> 54:51.524
The fuck you want?

54:52.459 --> 54:53.460
Coo Cooi.

54:56.631 --> 54:58.766
I told you before, I don't
know shit about no Coo Cooi.

54:58.799 --> 55:00.935
Yeah, you do.

55:00.968 --> 55:02.637
You know maybe I can
have these boys here,

55:02.670 --> 55:04.038
come in there
and jog your memory.

55:06.874 --> 55:08.175
We need to do
it this right here?

55:09.210 --> 55:10.410
Absolutely not.

55:35.836 --> 55:36.837
You guys hear that?

55:38.205 --> 55:39.572
Yeah, we got ears, don't we?

55:45.212 --> 55:48.182
I can pick each one
of them all from up here,

55:48.215 --> 55:49.951
if I had a .50 cal.

55:49.984 --> 55:52.820
Yeah. One shot
from that .50 cal,

55:52.853 --> 55:55.923
and there'll be on you like ants
on high fructose corn syrup.

55:57.291 --> 55:59.193
At least I'd have done my part.

56:00.628 --> 56:01.796
Anyone got a book?

56:02.997 --> 56:06.533
I can use a massage if you
feel like that'll help out...

56:07.601 --> 56:08.468
with time.

56:09.303 --> 56:11.739
I don't think you're my type.

56:11.772 --> 56:13.708
You got a type
during the apocalypse?

56:14.775 --> 56:17.144
Yeah, not alien.

56:18.179 --> 56:19.914
Well, I guess
that makes me alien then.

56:47.208 --> 56:49.810
Yo, they need to
stand so close to me?

56:49.844 --> 56:51.178
Making me uncomfortable.

56:52.813 --> 56:55.216
Got to compare ink,
you're a fan?

56:56.851 --> 56:59.586
I know I'm comfortable.
You boss?

57:00.788 --> 57:01.689
Yeah, I'm fine.

57:03.758 --> 57:04.992
You seen these things before?

57:07.094 --> 57:08.763
No.

57:08.796 --> 57:09.697
Heard of them though.

57:10.865 --> 57:11.766
Enlighten us.

57:14.902 --> 57:17.204
It was one of those stories
that used to scare little kids.

57:18.639 --> 57:20.674
When I was a boy in Baja,
my <i>abuelo</i>

57:20.708 --> 57:22.575
told me a story
about his grandfather.

57:24.111 --> 57:26.847
How he used to
trade with the settlers.

57:26.881 --> 57:28.581
I don't recall
seeing this on any map.

57:29.316 --> 57:31.685
You could have said
something before the ambush.

57:31.719 --> 57:35.056
Something's different here.
I can feel it.

57:35.089 --> 57:37.258
This place is empty.

57:37.291 --> 57:39.627
It looks like somebody
left in a great big hurry.

57:39.660 --> 57:41.662
What's that supposed to mean?

57:41.695 --> 57:43.164
- It means they were running for their damn lives.
- Quite.

57:43.197 --> 57:45.032
I know the heat is getting
to you, but this is enough.

57:45.066 --> 57:46.267
- Quiet.
- Stop!

57:47.234 --> 57:48.702
One day he came to them...

57:50.805 --> 57:52.606
and the entire
settlement was dead.

57:52.640 --> 57:53.974
- Go, go, go!
- James!

57:54.008 --> 57:56.143
Go, go! Don't you
take my brother!

57:56.177 --> 57:57.344
Come on!

58:43.023 --> 58:45.359
No, I love you.

58:58.772 --> 59:01.041
Bodies were there but...

59:01.075 --> 59:02.776
they had all the blood
taken from them.

59:04.011 --> 59:05.746
"Vampiros del cielo,"
he called them.

59:06.714 --> 59:08.115
The vampires from the sky.

59:10.918 --> 59:12.319
Space vampires?

59:12.353 --> 59:14.688
That's the stupidest
shit I've ever heard.

59:14.722 --> 59:16.824
Yo, I didn't
come up with the name.

59:16.857 --> 59:18.759
I know it sounds
fucking ridiculous to you,

59:18.792 --> 59:20.060
but that's what they are.

59:21.061 --> 59:22.263
They're here for blood.

59:36.010 --> 59:37.178
<i>Hijo de puta!</i>

59:42.483 --> 59:43.951
What the fuck are you?

59:43.984 --> 59:46.086
It's <i>pierde mierda.</i>

59:46.120 --> 59:46.987
<i>Mierda.</i>

01:00:16.984 --> 01:00:17.885
Oh, shit!

01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:22.189
Get the fuck off my planet.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.781
So how did they beat them?

01:00:51.218 --> 01:00:52.186
Never did.

01:00:53.454 --> 01:00:55.823
My <i>abuel</i> said they went
from settlement to settlement,

01:00:55.856 --> 01:00:58.125
they come in, take the blood,

01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.327
destroy the town
then split the next day.

01:01:01.528 --> 01:01:03.130
What do they use the blood for?

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:06.767
It's their medicine.

01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:11.171
Take him back to his cell.

01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:15.943
- Oh, it's like that, huh?
- Yeah, it's going to be like that.

01:01:20.447 --> 01:01:23.250
Put your gun
down now, drop the gun!

01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:59.086
Hey, hey!

01:02:00.054 --> 01:02:01.455
Yeah, you.

01:02:01.488 --> 01:02:03.357
Shut up, man, shut up.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.526
Shut up! Shut up!

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.397
Pussy ass,
cosplay gothic motherfucker.

01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:11.332
Shut up, man!

01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:13.300
Shut the hell up.

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.135
I got a costume in here.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:19.340
Sexy little nurse's outfit,
want to see?

01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:21.008
Shut up, man, shut up!

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:23.077
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.378
The fuck's wrong with you?

01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:40.060
It's okay, it's okay.

01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:48.168
No!

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:49.236
Shit, shit, shit,

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:51.405
shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:02:54.007 --> 01:02:54.975
C-Los.

01:02:57.177 --> 01:02:58.579
C-Los. Kai?

01:03:00.314 --> 01:03:01.415
They're all gone, chief.

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:11.024
I see a light.

01:03:29.576 --> 01:03:31.378
<i>They're coming.</i>

01:03:31.412 --> 01:03:35.282
They're coming here. Goddammit,
and we're sitting ducks.

01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:37.584
Then we make ourselves scarce.

01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:41.689
Wait a minute, there's
a tunnel in the basement.

01:03:41.723 --> 01:03:44.291
It goes under the street to
the precinct on the next block.

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:48.128
How do we get there?

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:51.131
Through the cell block,
so we're screwed either way.

01:03:53.768 --> 01:03:55.436
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:11.985
Get over here.
Here you go, brother.

01:04:21.295 --> 01:04:23.297
- New plan.
- What?

01:04:24.766 --> 01:04:26.500
I stay here and you go.

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:31.371
No, I... I can't do that.

01:04:32.339 --> 01:04:34.308
I'm not going to
make it out of this room.

01:04:35.677 --> 01:04:37.244
I don't want to slow you down.

01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:42.650
- Hey.
- What?

01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:45.586
You go get yourself well.

01:04:47.354 --> 01:04:48.422
I got this.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:52.226
I know you do.

01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:54.161
I know you got it.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.037
I know you do.

01:05:14.548 --> 01:05:16.550
<i>Paulson,
Officer Paulson,</i>

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:17.584
<i>you there?</i>

01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:21.522
<i>This is Sergeant Solon
at Nellis Air Force Base,</i>

01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:22.657
<i>people alive down there?</i>

01:05:23.858 --> 01:05:25.392
<i>Gone, everyone...</i>

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.365
Oh, shit.

01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:38.338
Solon, this is
officer Hannah Paulson, LAPD.

01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:41.743
Sergeant Solon.

01:05:43.745 --> 01:05:45.078
Sergeant Solon?

01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:58.292
Yo, yo!

01:05:58.325 --> 01:05:59.259
Yo!

01:06:17.745 --> 01:06:19.279
Took you long enough, man.

01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:22.650
Took you long enough to find me.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.287
Holy shit, well, you're real.

01:06:31.592 --> 01:06:33.093
I know who you are.

01:06:33.895 --> 01:06:35.362
You ain't no Coo Cooi.

01:06:37.598 --> 01:06:38.766
You're my father, huh?

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:40.635
Yeah.

01:06:41.603 --> 01:06:43.470
What's up, Dad?

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:44.772
What's up, Dad?

01:06:44.806 --> 01:06:46.573
You did this, right?

01:06:46.608 --> 01:06:48.475
You made me like this, right?

01:06:49.476 --> 01:06:51.445
You're a bad ass, man?
You ain't shit, bro.

01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:52.512
I'm worse than you.

01:06:54.448 --> 01:06:55.515
I'm worse than you.

01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:02.222
Come on Dad, you
killed me a long time ago, Dad.

01:07:02.255 --> 01:07:05.158
It's good to see you again, Dad.
It's good to see you again, Dad!

01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:16.570
Solon. Solon?

01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:18.740
- Can you send someone for us?
- Hannah. Hannah.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:19.907
We got to go. We got to go.

01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:21.241
I got someone
on the radio.

01:07:21.274 --> 01:07:22.442
It's the military.

01:07:23.477 --> 01:07:24.679
He said everyone's gone.

01:07:26.748 --> 01:07:28.415
Yeah, right.

01:07:28.448 --> 01:07:29.416
Hey, look.

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:33.520
You came in here with us,
now you're one of us.

01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:34.722
Let's get out of here, come on.

01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:42.864
<i>Paulson, you there?</i>

01:07:48.535 --> 01:07:52.439
Hey, get anything
useful from Aguirre?

01:07:52.472 --> 01:07:54.174
It's
an old Mexican legend.

01:07:54.876 --> 01:07:56.611
They're here
for a blood harvest.

01:07:57.577 --> 01:07:59.379
They use human blood
for medicine.

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:03.283
The tunnels aren't far,
two lefts and a right.

01:08:04.819 --> 01:08:07.955
A blood harvest?
Where's the rest of the team?

01:08:09.356 --> 01:08:10.390
They're gone.

01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:12.960
They're all gone.

01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:01.843
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:09:09.082 --> 01:09:10.283
Come on!

01:09:13.854 --> 01:09:14.822
What the...

01:09:14.856 --> 01:09:16.823
Get behind me.

01:09:16.858 --> 01:09:18.059
Stay close.

01:09:18.091 --> 01:09:19.559
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:09:19.593 --> 01:09:20.761
Hadouken!

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:24.698
Come on!

01:09:24.732 --> 01:09:26.399
Come on. Come and get it.

01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:27.935
Come here, you fuck!

01:09:27.969 --> 01:09:29.937
Come on!

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:47.386
Shit. What is that?

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:50.658
What the hell it that? Ah!

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.428
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:58.565
What the fuck do you want?

01:10:01.368 --> 01:10:03.805
You want blood,
you want what's inside me?

01:10:03.838 --> 01:10:05.706
Huh?

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:09.576
Take it.

01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:15.616
Take it!

01:10:47.447 --> 01:10:48.582
Holy shit.

01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:51.585
Let's move.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.056
There's nothing we can do here.

01:11:51.913 --> 01:11:54.048
If the precinct's clear,
we can get some ammo,

01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:55.983
supplies, whatever
we need to keep moving.

01:11:57.785 --> 01:11:59.787
Slinging over a mule here.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.756
Wait, there's animals down here?

01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:12.633
Did he say anything
about everybody being gone?

01:12:13.701 --> 01:12:16.103
The signal was bad,
I don't know what he meant.

01:12:16.137 --> 01:12:19.774
If it was just
the base or... worse.

01:12:19.807 --> 01:12:20.908
Assume worse.

01:12:21.976 --> 01:12:23.611
It's the end of the world, duh.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.082
He said something about
a helicopter,

01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:29.582
but he didn't say when or where.

01:12:30.885 --> 01:12:32.920
Probably scanning
the area for survivors.

01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.489
Assuming it's safe,
I say we get to the roof.

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:37.825
Lights some flares,
just in case.

01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:04.098
Can you help me?

01:16:05.432 --> 01:16:06.901
Can you help me?

01:16:08.502 --> 01:16:10.704
Come here. It's okay.

01:16:13.507 --> 01:16:14.441
Here you go.

01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:18.445
Lie down.

01:16:22.283 --> 01:16:23.417
That's bad.

01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:25.019
I'm not going to make it, am I?

01:16:27.788 --> 01:16:28.923
I'm sorry.

01:16:32.359 --> 01:16:33.460
One thing...

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.164
before you go...

01:16:38.065 --> 01:16:39.400
can you help me with the pain?

01:16:41.835 --> 01:16:42.736
Yeah.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.942
I can, uh...

01:16:47.975 --> 01:16:48.876
I can...

01:16:50.544 --> 01:16:52.346
I can make it stop.

01:16:52.379 --> 01:16:53.314
I promise.

01:16:58.886 --> 01:17:00.154
I promise.

01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:09.463
I hope that was him.

01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:13.934
Vernon?

01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:19.240
Vernon?

01:17:25.246 --> 01:17:26.480
Any survivors?

01:17:29.984 --> 01:17:30.884
No.

01:17:38.025 --> 01:17:38.993
I'm sorry.

01:17:46.133 --> 01:17:48.435
Regular rounds won't hurt them.

01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:49.370
What will?

01:17:51.105 --> 01:17:52.840
Hollow points.

01:17:52.873 --> 01:17:55.142
Yeah. Yeah, you're on fire.

01:17:56.176 --> 01:17:57.244
Fucking nuclear.

01:17:58.379 --> 01:17:59.446
Let's give it a try.

01:19:29.704 --> 01:19:31.271
God, I feel old.

01:19:35.008 --> 01:19:36.343
That's not my problem.

01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:40.214
I'm young... ish.

01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:47.187
I mean, I couldn't have come down
here, when I was like... 20.

01:19:52.627 --> 01:19:55.295
- Enjoying your vacation?
- This fucking sucks,

01:19:55.329 --> 01:19:57.297
I was supposed to see
the Hollywood sign today.

01:19:59.032 --> 01:20:00.334
You're safer in here, trust me.

01:20:02.737 --> 01:20:05.172
Hey, buddy, if
we make it out of here...

01:20:06.674 --> 01:20:08.075
I'll take you there myself.

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:10.310
That'll be cool.

01:20:11.245 --> 01:20:12.312
If it's still there.

01:20:24.158 --> 01:20:25.159
Wait a second.

01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:29.296
It found us.

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:31.165
Can this thing go
any fucking faster?

01:20:32.065 --> 01:20:33.167
It's here!

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.435
It's here.

01:20:42.142 --> 01:20:43.177
Fuck!

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:45.345
What the fuck is that? Shit!

01:20:48.081 --> 01:20:50.050
- I'm out.
- You're out?

01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:51.018
Re-load.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.721
Back.

01:21:01.428 --> 01:21:02.396
What the...

01:21:09.436 --> 01:21:10.370
Ah!

01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:33.093
I got your backs!
I got your backs!

01:22:03.156 --> 01:22:04.358
Told you I can be helpful.

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:09.764
You are one of us.

01:22:25.145 --> 01:22:26.146
Let's go.

01:22:28.549 --> 01:22:29.449
Yeah.

01:22:35.255 --> 01:22:36.156
Let's go.

01:22:48.703 --> 01:22:50.137
Where the hell is it?

01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:05.753
- Fuck!
- Come on!

01:23:05.787 --> 01:23:07.387
Cover me.

01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:09.256
Come on. Come on,
get me. Get me.

01:23:09.289 --> 01:23:10.257
Come on!

01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:14.294
Do it! Do it!

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:16.563
Come on.

01:23:22.235 --> 01:23:24.271
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Come on!

01:23:25.339 --> 01:23:26.373
Huh? What's wrong?

01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:30.612
Yeah!

01:23:32.179 --> 01:23:33.213
Come on!

01:23:33.246 --> 01:23:35.549
Come on! Come and get it.

01:23:35.582 --> 01:23:38.452
You ugly green,
fucking son of a bitch, come on!

01:23:38.485 --> 01:23:40.153
Come on!

01:24:07.247 --> 01:24:09.383
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.823
What, you know
what's wrong with me? Huh?

01:24:15.857 --> 01:24:18.893
I'll tell you, I'm dying.

01:24:18.926 --> 01:24:20.762
I'm dying.

01:24:20.795 --> 01:24:21.929
You don't like that, do you?

01:24:24.297 --> 01:24:25.633
You don't want to take me?

01:24:26.601 --> 01:24:27.935
I'll take you.

01:24:33.306 --> 01:24:34.441
Go ahead!

01:24:34.474 --> 01:24:35.877
Go ahead!

01:24:37.912 --> 01:24:39.413
Come on!

01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:43.316
Hey, fuck face.

01:24:49.523 --> 01:24:50.557
You okay?

01:24:52.325 --> 01:24:53.226
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:25:03.537 --> 01:25:05.372
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

01:25:13.681 --> 01:25:14.615
Shit.

01:25:57.992 --> 01:25:59.026
Vernon?

01:26:04.699 --> 01:26:06.533
Vernon!

01:27:24.178 --> 01:27:25.378
Fuck.

01:30:06.007 --> 01:30:07.108
Oh, my God.

01:32:57.878 --> 01:32:58.846
Oh, shit.

01:33:05.819 --> 01:33:07.188
We got to get you out of here.

01:33:10.191 --> 01:33:11.859
No, you're not going to do that.

01:33:15.996 --> 01:33:16.897
It's bad.

01:33:18.999 --> 01:33:19.934
It's bad.

01:33:23.837 --> 01:33:24.738
Look.

01:33:26.006 --> 01:33:28.175
Stay strong, all right?

01:33:31.378 --> 01:33:33.314
Don't forget about the team.

01:33:33.347 --> 01:33:34.381
I won't.

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:46.460
You know what?

01:33:48.095 --> 01:33:49.029
Cancer...

01:33:51.932 --> 01:33:53.467
it's a son of a bitch.

01:36:05.999 --> 01:36:08.068
There we go.

01:36:08.102 --> 01:36:09.303
She's awake.

01:36:22.549 --> 01:36:24.485
Jesus Christ.

01:36:25.986 --> 01:36:27.655
That bad?

01:36:27.689 --> 01:36:28.589
Yeah.

01:36:33.994 --> 01:36:35.529
Sergeant Solon.

01:36:35.562 --> 01:36:36.497
That's right.

01:36:38.065 --> 01:36:40.000
You must have circled
the city a dozen times.

01:36:41.703 --> 01:36:43.237
Are there any other survivors?

01:36:45.005 --> 01:36:46.006
Just him there.

01:36:47.441 --> 01:36:49.143
Got him wandering the streets.

01:36:50.377 --> 01:36:52.246
Damn near dead.

01:36:52.279 --> 01:36:53.981
I'm not dead.

01:36:54.014 --> 01:36:55.617
I'm alive.

01:36:55.650 --> 01:36:58.185
Only because we
got you out in time.

01:36:58.218 --> 01:37:00.688
But I did make it. I'm alive.

01:37:09.062 --> 01:37:09.963
Where are we?

01:37:10.998 --> 01:37:13.701
Over the Arizona desert,
we're out to Camp Navajo.

01:37:15.703 --> 01:37:17.271
So you know
what happened, right?

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.240
You know what
happened to the city.

01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:24.244
Same thing happened
in San Francisco...

01:37:24.278 --> 01:37:25.212
Seattle...

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:28.182
most of the Western seaboard.

01:37:28.215 --> 01:37:30.350
I was in San Diego
before I was...

01:37:32.419 --> 01:37:33.987
We found a few others
on the radio.

01:37:35.623 --> 01:37:38.125
But you two are the only ones
that have survived.

01:37:41.128 --> 01:37:42.496
Everyone else is gone.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.468
The government's
considering an air strike,

01:37:47.501 --> 01:37:48.636
whether there's
survivors or not.

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:52.740
- An air strike, are you serious?
- Yes.

01:37:52.774 --> 01:37:56.410
Come on, man. A nuclear war
is not going to solve anything.

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:04.218
So it really is the harvest.

01:38:07.622 --> 01:38:08.555
Yes.

01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:12.727
So you know about the legend?

01:38:15.462 --> 01:38:17.197
It's been
classified for decades.

01:38:20.367 --> 01:38:21.268
Great.

01:38:22.604 --> 01:38:25.138
Anything else useful
still classified?

01:38:27.374 --> 01:38:28.710
Like what?

01:38:28.743 --> 01:38:30.077
Like how we fight them?

01:38:31.646 --> 01:38:32.680
No.

01:38:41.188 --> 01:38:42.322
There's your weapon.

01:38:44.792 --> 01:38:45.793
What is it?

01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:49.263
It's a form of blood cancer.

01:38:54.201 --> 01:38:55.102
Cancer?

01:38:59.172 --> 01:39:00.073
Yeah.

01:39:02.509 --> 01:39:04.177
Welcome to the resistance.
