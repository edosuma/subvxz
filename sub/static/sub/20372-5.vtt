00:11.595 --> 00:13.597
The alumni board are gonna find

00:13.681 --> 00:15.724
this new information very interesting.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.643
We're just going to delay the announcement

00:17.726 --> 00:19.227
of your promotion a couple of weeks.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.980
I hate my boss and I want to quit my job.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.857
-The coolest firm in Seattle.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.775
It's not like I'm actually gonna go.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.318
I just really want to be cool again.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.738
Suburban Internet -- sex tape, scandal.

00:29.822 --> 00:30.990
I don't hate it.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.992
How would you feel about helping kids

00:33.074 --> 00:36.161
get to the other side of 21

00:36.244 --> 00:38.246
Dave: Oh, is this about the thing I said about the bike?

00:38.330 --> 00:41.082
You don't think Emma's bi

00:41.166 --> 00:43.293
You guys have been third-wheeling

00:41.166 --> 00:43.293
the shit out of me.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.045
You get to undercurrent all of your primary ex

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256

00:48.340 --> 00:50.258
-Listen to me.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.928
I just finished telling someone that I was the complication.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.513
-Ruby.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.455

Oh, that's lovely.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.919
Can you rupture something snoring that hard?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.712
Radical theory -- do you think

01:25.002 --> 01:26.712
that humans snore

01:26.795 --> 01:28.547
so that in the caveman days, someone didn't bury them?

01:28.630 --> 01:31.132
Prefacing something idiotic with "radical theory"

01:31.216 --> 01:32.634
doesn't make it less idiotic.

Little Gabe -- on point with his sass game.

01:37.056 --> 01:39.224
Little Gabe getting sassy, eh? -Call me that one more time,

01:39.307 --> 01:41.727
I will put a pillow over your giant face and sit on it.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.813
Yeah, you will.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.774
Okay, this is...

01:46.857 --> 01:48.609
unsettling.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.778
Uh, say, Gabriel, do you want to...

01:50.861 --> 01:52.654
Make sure Marina doesn't walk into traffic

01:52.738 --> 01:54.489
while taking a selfie and become the face

01:54.573 --> 01:56.408
of a national public service campaign?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.035
Super funny.

-Dumb-ass. -Dickhead.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.999
Gabe, so, look, not to be that brother,

02:04.083 --> 02:05.918
but I can't have the kids witnessing a gruesome,

02:06.001 --> 02:07.252
prolonged descent.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.754
I'm fine, I just need a few minutes--

02:08.837 --> 02:10.464
Okay, you obviously don't remember,

02:10.547 --> 02:13.174
and I wish that I didn't, but last night...

02:13.258 --> 02:17.012
last night was a weepy, snotty shit show.

02:17.096 --> 02:19.222
No. It wasn't that bad, I --

02:19.306 --> 02:20.474
It wasn't that bad.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.434
Oh, yeah. Yeah, if you were our pet,

02:22.517 --> 02:25.520
we would have just shot you and buried you out back.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.520
Stop.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.314
Oh, man.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.690
Feels like I'm losing everything.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.359
You're not exactly losing anything, bro.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.237
No, you very willingly walked away from a promotion,

02:34.321 --> 02:35.697
and then you left your home

02:35.781 --> 02:38.533
and your wife with her new girlfriend.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.120
Okay, you know what?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.539
Okay, enough, okay?

02:44.623 --> 02:46.416
Maybe Emma and I for the past few years

02:46.500 --> 02:48.209
weren't awesome in the bedroom,

02:48.293 --> 02:51.046
but we did have some really incredible times before that.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.298
Like, really hardcore stuff. I don't know if she told you,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.342
but, I mean, not like porn star level, but --

02:55.425 --> 02:57.636
-Stop, please. -Yeah, it's...

02:57.719 --> 02:59.513
Okay, but it wasn't even about the sex, okay?

02:59.596 --> 03:01.180
It was the fact that we had a connection,

03:01.264 --> 03:02.808
that we were together. -Jack, lesbians are deceptive.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.852
They look just like real chicks. You know, they wear dresses,

03:04.935 --> 03:06.353
they wear makeup, they marry dudes.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.438
It's true.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.150
You know how much I like Emma.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.234
We both do. And for the record,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.236
I do really believe that you guys were in love

03:15.320 --> 03:16.780
since the first night that you met.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.365
Thank you. Finally --

03:18.448 --> 03:19.825
someone speaking the truth here.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.952
But then you introduced a woman

03:22.036 --> 03:23.578
into your marriage, and you reminded your wife

03:23.662 --> 03:24.913
that she's at least three-quarters gay.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.124
She's not. Oh, my God. What the fuck?

03:27.206 --> 03:28.625
Hey. Please don't,

03:27.206 --> 03:28.625

03:28.709 --> 03:30.002
No, no. Hey.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.173
Shh.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.632
I love you.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.093
-Yeah. Yeah. -All right.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.511
All right, I want you to have what we have.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.637
Yeah.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.389
I got to go, 'cause work calls.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.640
I have a job.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.684
And good luck.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.813
I'm sorry.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.607
Take a long, brisk walk, all right?

03:52.691 --> 03:54.442
Clear your head.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.238
Get some perspective and just think about things.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
-That sounds good, actually. -Okay.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.782
-Yeah. -Do that.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.283
I'm gonna do that.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.603
evened things up, so now we're all good?

Oh, for fuck's sake, why don't I count it down

06:47.782 --> 06:50.660

06:52.787 --> 06:54.915
In what version of the universe am I the bad guy?

06:54.998 --> 06:58.168
Uh, how about the version where the last words

06:58.252 --> 06:59.836
you said to us before you stormed out

06:59.920 --> 07:01.755
were "Ruby Shivani."

07:01.838 --> 07:04.091
Uh, maybe the version where you've been acting

07:04.174 --> 07:06.343
like a wounded emo middle-schooler.

07:06.425 --> 07:09.388
Meanwhile, the real version in the real world

07:09.470 --> 07:12.015
consists of two lesbians,

07:12.099 --> 07:13.558
a happy gay couple,

07:13.641 --> 07:16.353
who just have this inconvenient dude

07:16.436 --> 07:19.398
who's like a fucking goddamn beard around them all the time.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.524
Honestly, enough with the beard stuff.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.569
Was there any point in the last 30 minutes or so

07:24.652 --> 07:28.031
where I seemed gay to you?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.200
I'm in love with you.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.661
Look at me. I'm in love with you and Emma.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.997
To be honest, maybe it's not you that I'm worried about.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.709
Okay, Jack.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.211

'Cause I haven't heard from her.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.831
Not a word since I've been here, so...

08:20.541 --> 08:22.669
Did she tell you she wants me to come home?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.090
I mean...

08:28.508 --> 08:30.051
No.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.223
Oh, you have an excuse?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.238
Let's go find your friends.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.823
Mmm.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.991
Wow.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.452
So, if I go get my camera right now,

10:18.535 --> 10:19.786
would you be willing to reenact

10:19.869 --> 10:21.704
that whole sad, dark performance?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.081
'Cause that's exactly the opening I need

10:23.164 --> 10:26.167
for my documentary -- "White People."

10:26.626 --> 10:28.211
What about white people?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.630
Well, humans crave challenges and hardships,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.840
and when they don't get those things, they...

10:32.924 --> 10:35.009
reflexively sabotage themselves.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.804
Or die on a mountain they had no reason to climb.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
That's impressive.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.933
That's, like, adolescent bullshit,

10:42.016 --> 10:45.395
but it's impressive within that specific category.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.482
Well done, man. -Yeah.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.859
So what's rock bottom for a guy like you?

10:51.943 --> 10:53.487
Shouldn't you be in school or something?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.448
Put Marie on Locations so I know where she is at all times.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.367
I'm just missing, like, study hall or Advanced Calc --

10:59.451 --> 11:01.411
one or the other. -You know what, I don't care.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.204
This is so boring.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.039
This has nothing -- it's nothing to do with me.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.749
It's not my problem.

11:07.792 --> 11:12.506
Seriously, do you need help with all of this business?

11:12.589 --> 11:13.965
All of what

11:20.263 --> 11:23.016
So what were you doing while you were hugging the toilet

11:23.099 --> 11:26.019
and staring at your phone?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.271
I was checking the calendar.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.276
Seriously?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.320
Don't worry. It's -- my dates were messed up.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.695
That's all.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.532
Well, you don't seem particularly happy.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.075
Usually at your age, that's a happy thing.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.413
You are on birth control, right?

11:45.497 --> 11:47.165
What are you insinuating?

11:47.248 --> 11:50.335
I'm not insinuating anything. I just...

11:56.924 --> 11:59.010
Iz.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.388
Hey, Izzy, are you okay?

12:03.764 --> 12:07.768
I got so fucked up.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.728
Yeah.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.064
I could tell.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.906
It's just...

12:19.989 --> 12:23.742
Jack left, and you said he never leaves.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.704
Which means it's my fault.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.622
And I feel like I'm an alien here,

12:27.706 --> 12:29.832
and I just -- I just w--

12:29.916 --> 12:33.878
You just want to feel like yourself again.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.964
Yeah, I get that.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.717
I'm really sorry, Em.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.553
I've been a passive-aggressive dick these last few days.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.597
Hey...

12:43.680 --> 12:47.892
We have all taken turns being dicks lately.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.810
All of us.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.479
Because we fucked up.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.855
Because we're moving too fast.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.109
And none of us wants to say anything.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.486
I don't know.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.071
Well, you can hold me to this,

13:00.154 --> 13:03.824
I am officially on an intense substance cleanse.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.118
Ugh.

13:05.201 --> 13:05.993
Yeah?

13:06.077 --> 13:08.413
Yeah.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.706
We'll do it together.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.250
Yeah? Yeah.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.086
I know I have barf

13:15.169 --> 13:17.088
No, you do have barf-mouth.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.717
Whoo, man. This feels like 50 shades of wrong.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.344
It's gonna feel 31 flavors of right real soon.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.179
Before we do this, just so you know,

13:25.263 --> 13:26.805
this is a one-time thing. Okay, this has to be.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.516
This is just me trying to,

13:28.600 --> 13:30.268
you know, get on a bridge to the other side.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.603
This is -- Don't do me any favors.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.605
No, no, I mean, come on, after this.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.814
Just sit down, I need...

13:35.898 --> 13:37.609
Thank you, I guess I should say.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.985
That's better.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.195
Yeah. Thanks.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.618
So you ever gonna sober up enough

13:46.701 --> 13:49.621
to tap that Ruby chick

13:49.704 --> 13:51.164
I'm just gonna forge on, assuming that

13:51.247 --> 13:52.332
that's what you want to say.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.125
Balls! So, yes, I overheard

13:54.208 --> 13:55.876
Gabe and Marie talking about how much better off

13:55.960 --> 13:56.961
you'd be with Ruby.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.883
Don't hate me, I can't call an ambulance

14:02.967 --> 14:04.843
under these incriminating circumstances.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.055

14:08.139 --> 14:11.351

14:41.464 --> 14:43.049
Um, I'm Emma Trakarsky.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.760
We talked on the phone.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.136
Right.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.639
Right.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.809
So that space just got snatched.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.019
While you were eating a sandwich?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.731
I can multitask.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.441
May I ask who snatched it?

15:00.525 --> 15:02.902
It was...

15:02.985 --> 15:04.153
John...

15:04.237 --> 15:05.530
Ham.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.073
Jon Hamm.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.158
Jon Hamm, the actor?

15:09.242 --> 15:12.245
Maybe he's gonna open an ad agency.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.954
I don't know what smells worse, your lazy bullshit

15:14.038 --> 15:16.999
or the hostile cologne you bathed in.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.085
Custom blended specifically for me.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.421
Five large. Gets me laid like a carpet.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.093
Hey!

15:27.176 --> 15:29.637
What about the five other spaces?

15:29.721 --> 15:32.139
Strangest thing. They all got snatched, too.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.688
She knows.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.981
She fucking knows.

15:41.065 --> 15:45.236
♪

15:47.739 --> 15:50.032
God, these are good!

15:50.116 --> 15:52.118
What do you call this glorious manna?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.828
Spicy pork rinds.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.956
Is that like a nickname, or does it really come from a pig?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.499
I choose not to think about it.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.877
It's working though, man.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.546
I can...

16:03.630 --> 16:05.089
It's working, man.

16:05.172 --> 16:09.260
It feels like a lifetime ago that I was hung over.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.512
Yeah, you're welcome.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.013
So do you really love them?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.766
Both of them?

16:14.849 --> 16:15.975
Who?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.730
Oh, yes. Yeah.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.022
I do.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.236
But you think Aunt Emma might be gay, always has been?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.908
I don't know, maybe.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.828
Grownup life sounds pretty fucked up.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.537
Yeah.

16:37.580 --> 16:41.125
What about the college professor chick?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.503
That's just purely professional. We're...

16:43.586 --> 16:44.796
just friends.

16:44.879 --> 16:45.922
Actually might be colleagues soon.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.841
Oh!

16:47.924 --> 16:50.134
Okay.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.136
I'm 14 years old, and even I know

16:52.219 --> 16:54.639
you can't be friends with your hot, divorced ex.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.599
Okay, you can only pretend it's platonic

16:56.683 --> 16:59.602
until the imminent "Oops, we boned" incident.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.398
You're like some sort of sensei.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.987
I guess I'll, uh...

17:09.069 --> 17:10.989
design the rest of my life based on the deep thoughts

17:11.071 --> 17:12.615
of a stoned high school freshman.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.741
Yeah, you want me to lay down

17:13.825 --> 17:15.284
some more heavy duty wisdom on you?

17:15.368 --> 17:16.494
Please, why not?

17:16.577 --> 17:18.496
Well, if you and the professor chick

17:18.579 --> 17:20.581
had stayed together, you would have three kids

17:20.665 --> 17:23.668
and be the dean of Hamilton High School right now...

17:23.751 --> 17:27.547
instead of smoking away your hangover with your nephew.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.590
Heavy, right?

17:29.674 --> 17:31.467
Yeah.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.220
It's like a cat in the box.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
Absolutely.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.976
Wait, what?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.278
Hey, you.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.697
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.657
Lunchtime, I think.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.909
Yeah.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.369
You pay for that stuff or...

17:58.452 --> 17:59.871
They barely staff weekdays.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.790
You could pretty much have whatever you want.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.376
For instance, Chloe Damico thinks

18:05.459 --> 18:07.127
she's pregnant every other Monday,

18:07.211 --> 18:09.964
snags like five different brands just to make sure.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.257
Oh -- But then again,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.052
she's like a teenager and you're... 30.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.511
Okay. So...

18:15.595 --> 18:18.723
First of all, I'm nothing like 30.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.974
Okay. And, second of all,

18:20.058 --> 18:21.893
you thought --

18:21.976 --> 18:24.353
you thought I was shopping for pregnancy tests

18:24.437 --> 18:26.272
Because you're reading all the labels.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.359
Well, I'm doing research for a college paper.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.614
You suck so bad at lying.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.074
Well, I used to be better.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.242
I think we peak at 16.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.369
God, it's like breathing for me.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.583
W.W.L.D.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.923
What is that?

18:52.006 --> 18:53.633
What would Lori do?

18:53.716 --> 18:55.175
Easy-peasy.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.596
She'd narc you out to your lezzy life partner.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.976
So I won't.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.520
I'm assuming this means you're late.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.858
Just -- it's just a few days.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.485
Normally, you can set a clock by it.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.487
I'm sorry.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.492
Why are you hugging me?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.120
Because Lori wouldn't.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.556
I -- I can't believe you would do this to me, Danny.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.060
I have a right to explore other options, God damn it!

19:52.859 --> 19:55.653
Yeah? Fuck you!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.071
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck --

19:57.155 --> 19:58.698
fucking grow up. It's just business, really?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.741
Well, fuck -- fuck me!

20:00.825 --> 20:03.327
Emma?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.829
Lori.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.998
Car make you angry

20:07.081 --> 20:08.207
Huh.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.544
Um, actually...

20:11.627 --> 20:13.754
Actually, I was yelling at my boss.

20:13.838 --> 20:17.050
Yeah. She found out I was scouting office space,

20:17.133 --> 20:20.260
so she's blackballing me at the few places I can afford.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.096
And it turns out I signed a contract

20:22.180 --> 20:26.017
that basically says I can't hire anybody ever.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.853
So you might be mad at me a little, still.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.438
Afraid so, Lo.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.901
Lo

20:34.984 --> 20:37.611
That's great.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.279
All right, well, brace yourself.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.116
Brace myself? Just go with it.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.120
Em and Lo, that's us.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.081
That's the spirit.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.838
♪

21:11.938 --> 21:13.397
Ruby: Do you have an appointment?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.025
Um, yeah, like, for sure,

21:16.109 --> 21:18.736
Professor, I do.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.030
Worst imitation of a college chick ever.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.281
Come in, Jack.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.616
I don't even know who Jack is.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.285
Jack is dead. I killed him with my period.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.912
That was awesome, right?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.706
No, it was terrible.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.042
Hey.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.585
Where the hell have you been?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.337
It's like you fell off the edge of the earth.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.756
Can we say that's more or less

21:38.839 --> 21:40.133
an accurate representation

21:40.216 --> 21:43.094
of what's been happening and leave it at that?

21:43.177 --> 21:45.721
I've been staying at my brother's place.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.267
Oh.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.102
Sorry, I, um -- Sorry to hear.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.229
It's nothing. Look, I've been trying

21:53.312 --> 21:55.148
to get ahold of you because the dean is interested

21:55.231 --> 21:57.441
in hearing your student services pitch.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.235
But it has to be tomorrow because he leaves

21:59.318 --> 22:02.446
the day after for a conference overseas.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.823
Can you be ready?

22:03.906 --> 22:05.950
I was born ready.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.576
I've always wanted to say that.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.703
Yes. Great.

22:09.787 --> 22:10.788
Awesome.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.665
Maybe I can thank you for real

22:12.748 --> 22:16.294
by taking you out to dinner tomorrow night.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.962
Are you asking me on a date?

22:18.045 --> 22:19.297
Absolutely not.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.757
I'm just inviting a soon-to-be-colleague

22:21.841 --> 22:25.385
out for a platonic celebration of my imminent success.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.345
I don't sleep with married men, Jack.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.808
Neither do I, so we have that in common.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.726
Yes.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.603
Great.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.571
Hey, Carm?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.532
What's my motivation here, you know?

22:46.615 --> 22:50.703
I mean, like, I could pretty much slip out of

22:46.615 --> 22:50.703
these any second I want.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.496
Carmen: Use your imagination!

22:52.579 --> 22:54.332
Whoa.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.502
Wow. Look at you.

22:58.585 --> 23:02.756
Standing there, wearing<i> that?</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:05.134
Is this okay?

23:05.218 --> 23:06.552
Is it okay?!

23:06.635 --> 23:08.304
It's really scary.

23:08.386 --> 23:09.763
And sexy.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.599
Has to be scary and sexy, not just scary.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.143
I meant scary in a sexy way, that's all.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.895
I'm gonna have to edit this out.

23:15.978 --> 23:17.604
Okay, you know what, fuck you! You're not even trying.

23:17.688 --> 23:18.856
I was laughing with you, honey.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.233
No, no, no! No, no, no!

23:20.316 --> 23:21.483
Come back, come back, come back, come back!

23:21.567 --> 23:22.693
Look -- hey, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

23:22.776 --> 23:23.777
Come, come, come.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.445
Come, come.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
Look, I'm already at half mast,

23:26.864 --> 23:29.533
and you haven't even done anything to me yet.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.702
What are you gonna do to me, by the way?

23:31.785 --> 23:35.248
You gonna use that fly

23:35.331 --> 23:36.498
I mean, I'm pretty stoned,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.584
so that could be fun or terrifying --

23:38.667 --> 23:40.086
or maybe both.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.628
And I guess that's how this is all supposed to work,

23:41.712 --> 23:42.671
right, so...

23:42.755 --> 23:44.257
<i>Fairly</i> high, too.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.177
Hey, what if I really like swatting you?

23:48.261 --> 23:50.304
Oh, boy. What if I just...

23:50.388 --> 23:52.056
Oh.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.850
What if I just swat the shit out of you

23:54.934 --> 23:58.896
and I can't get off and don't stop, yeah!

23:58.979 --> 24:00.522
Well, I would remind you

24:00.606 --> 24:04.193
that I'm only pretending to be tied up, so...

24:04.277 --> 24:06.153
Oh, God, what if the kids die?

24:06.237 --> 24:07.821
I'm sorry? What if the kids die

24:07.905 --> 24:10.032
because we're high and I'm obsessively swatting you?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.533
I'm sorry, is that -- is that part of this,

24:11.617 --> 24:12.910
or are you -- I'm not --

24:12.993 --> 24:16.538
No, I'm sorry. Is that, um... stupid?

24:16.622 --> 24:19.917
Yes, I think so? I don't know.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.671
So what now?

24:24.755 --> 24:27.591
I mean, you know, you could, um...

24:27.674 --> 24:28.968
You know...

24:36.183 --> 24:37.684
I think the dominant party

24:37.768 --> 24:39.561
would be on the receiving end of that. Nice try.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.021
I actually read that a lot of women

24:41.105 --> 24:42.648
find giving head very empowering.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.858
Yeah, a man definitely concocted that bullshit.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.110
Why don't you go back to the cave

24:46.193 --> 24:47.778
and tell them we didn't fall for it.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.863
Okay, so why don't we just have sex?

24:49.947 --> 24:52.241
I mean, I think smoking weed and having sex

24:52.325 --> 24:54.285
is pretty cool, by suburban-parent standards.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.703
Hmm, whatever. Sure.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.664
All right.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.749
Geez. Oof!

25:00.833 --> 25:02.668
Okay, you're gonna be quiet

25:02.751 --> 25:05.004
and you're gonna stuff me like a Thanksgiving turkey.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.007
Okay, now, that...

25:08.090 --> 25:10.550
What

25:10.634 --> 25:15.097
I thought we were gonna stop peeping on people.

25:10.634 --> 25:15.097
Emma and Lori walking together.

25:15.181 --> 25:19.726
Emma and Lori.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.520
Oh, God! Emma had a super-bad day!

25:22.604 --> 25:25.399
So? She's gonna poison

25:22.604 --> 25:25.399
or otherwise murder Lori.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.859
Whoa, honey, honey, honey.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.568
Okay, I think you established

25:28.652 --> 25:31.529
that you might have the THC tolerance of a toddler.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.824
That feels nice. Yeah?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.909
Oh.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.453
-Yeah.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.079
Geez. I'm gonna go over there.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.706
What? I'm gonna go over there

25:39.163 --> 25:40.706
just to make sure,

25:40.789 --> 25:42.291
because she's made a lot of really fucked up decisions.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.917
Okay, but don't -- don't completely abandon

25:44.001 --> 25:45.794
that fly-swatter thing. I kind of... like that.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.339
<i></i> All you, babe.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.423
Oh, great. Okay.

25:49.507 --> 25:50.590
I'll, uh...

25:50.674 --> 25:52.301
I'll tend to my crying child...

25:52.385 --> 25:53.802
while I'm super high

25:53.886 --> 25:56.554
and midway through experimenting with light S&amp;M.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.855
Look.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.149
It's Lady Carm

26:07.233 --> 26:09.443
You okay?

26:10.736 --> 26:12.446
I don't think so.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.573
I'm currently hallucinating that you and Lori Matherfield

26:15.657 --> 26:17.034
are getting high on your porch.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.078
Ooh, you want to join?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.872
Or are you on your way to a performance?

26:27.794 --> 26:29.004
Yeah, what the hell?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.672
How much weirder can my night get?

26:30.756 --> 26:31.715
Why?

26:31.798 --> 26:33.008
You don't want to know.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.473
This is good. I am happy and relieved.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.766
This is good. Nina: Hey.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.851
I am happy and relieved.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.019
This...

26:44.103 --> 26:45.479
You moved out.

26:45.563 --> 26:46.813
Hi.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.275
Remember, you kind of got to pay rent

26:49.358 --> 26:50.568
or give up the key, babe.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.029
Already moved into my room, huh?

26:54.113 --> 26:56.115
Um, I'm kidding.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.615
Iz, you can come by whenever you want --

26:57.699 --> 26:58.951
more often, preferably.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.287
Thanks.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.997
Yay, right?

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
Yeah, it's my third.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.751
They're all the same.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.922
Jesus.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.258
Ooh, uh...

27:14.341 --> 27:15.926
Were you hoping for something different?

27:16.009 --> 27:19.472
Mm, not when I bought them.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.643
And now?

27:25.727 --> 27:27.354
Well, um...

27:27.438 --> 27:31.442
I know this is good, and I'm happy and relieved,

27:31.525 --> 27:35.695
or I am more profoundly fucked in the head than I thought.

27:35.779 --> 27:40.033
So... this is good.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.827
And I am happy...

27:41.910 --> 27:43.954
and relieved.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.543
Come here.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.045
There's seriously something wrong with me.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.297
I know.
