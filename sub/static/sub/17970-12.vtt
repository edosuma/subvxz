WEBVTT

02:53.173 --> 02:55.383
There's no going back now.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.801
Why would you want to?

02:57.803 --> 03:00.972
What has the world outside
ever given to you?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.766
Nothing. Less than nothing.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.268
I wanted to be a healer.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.353
That's your past talking.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.481
You're so much more than that now.

03:10.649 --> 03:14.193
You've shed your old clothing
along with your old life.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.696
You're reborn now.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.865
Ascendant.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.578
Under your guidance, we will prevail.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.622
We will take back our Abbey.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.792
Our island.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.796
Why stop there?

03:34.298 --> 03:38.050
The outside world is soul-sick, Anne.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.969
Why not heal it?

03:40.429 --> 03:43.347
We can expand our reach
all the way to the mainland.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.558
The island has always been our home.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.314
That's your past talking.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.819
First, we need to break
the naval blockade.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.613
What we lack is leverage.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.615
We need to control something they want.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.575
How?

04:03.201 --> 04:05.161
We're trapped here.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.414
Trapped with the CDC.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.961
They've discovered a cure for Mycosis.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.672
We need to get our hands on that cure.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.552
Then we eliminate them.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.896
Stings a bit.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.482
It's better than the alternative.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.992
What's this for?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.702
You need it worse than I do.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.330
Coast Guard needs it too.
Get it off the island.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.041
I don't know what to say.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.460
I mean, I tried to kill you yesterday.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.379
That wasn't you, it was the pathogen.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.050
I was wrong about you.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.178
I used to think
there was a right and a wrong...

05:04.346 --> 05:05.513
...no in-between.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.975
But immortality turned
all that upside down.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.644
I were you,
I'd forget I ever set foot on this island.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.812
Can't do that.

05:12.980 --> 05:17.108
When this is all over,
I still gotta turn you in.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.405
I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.782
This is all over, I'll turn myself in.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.994
But first I need a favor.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.913
-All right.
-I need to borrow your gun.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.585
And I need to know
what happened in Paris.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.009
First Bank of Atlanta.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.511
Safety deposit box 274.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.514
You'll find all the proof you need.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.651
Mother's dead.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.446
No fungal antigens, nothing.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.407
You could try
an ammonium nitrogen-based fertilizer.

06:06.575 --> 06:10.036
That would take a month. I've only got
one day before the Narvik release.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.291
Did you hear what I said?

06:15.459 --> 06:18.002
-Sorry. What?
-Nothing.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.005
Just the end of the human race
as we know it.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.507
You'll figure something out.
You always do.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.217
What is that?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.888
Homemade perfluorocarbon.
Highly oxygenated, breathable.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.016
Similar to what Dr. Adrian was using
on Peter to keep him alive.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.684
I think it might work here.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.269
-For how long?
-Indefinitely.

06:35.437 --> 06:39.065
As long as he's receiving fresh infusions
every 30 minutes.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.569
You're gonna inject fluid into that jar
every half hour for the rest of your life?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.737
If I have to.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.907
Jules?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.374
My God.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.337
Is that...

07:01.838 --> 07:03.672
...our child?

07:05.217 --> 07:09.762
Why don't I let you two
have some time alone?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.066
So that's where the root came from.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.692
The Mother Tree.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.820
She's the reason we're on this island.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.280
Michael discovered her
so many years ago.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.284
Her root system contained
amazing medicinal properties.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.911
Like infertility?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.330
Michael spent decades studying her.

07:36.498 --> 07:41.460
After she died, he took pieces of the root
and grafted them onto other plantings.

07:41.628 --> 07:46.423
The piece that was lost was
the last remnant of the original tree.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.259
I need to go to the tree's location.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.886
There may be viable seeds
or pieces of root left.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.764
-That's not possible.
-It's a long shot, but I have to try.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.183
You misunderstand.
I'd take you there if I could.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.477
Michael was the only one
who knew its location.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.770
But this painting....

07:59.938 --> 08:01.522
Is nearly 300 years old.

08:01.690 --> 08:05.442
It's a view from a hill near the Abbey,
but the tree is long gone.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.819
There must be some record.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.321
You're welcome to look
through Michael's ledgers...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.657
...provided you have Eli's permission.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.534
Who's Eli?

08:18.331 --> 08:21.792
Eli, Dr. Walker would like a word.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.633
What the hell?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.928
Peter. Where are your clothes?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.471
Peter is dead.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.683
This is Eli, the new leader of our order.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.810
Eli?

08:40.312 --> 08:43.856
-All right, you're kidding, right?
-A new man deserves a new name.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.735
-Eli means "ascendant" in--
-I don't care what it means.

08:47.903 --> 08:53.032
Peter, you're a doctor. Are you gonna
throw away everything for this?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.617
I found a higher calling...

08:55.577 --> 08:59.038
...a sense of purpose,
a place to belong.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.331
Much like you did.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.667
All right, Eli. I need full access
to Michael's records.

09:04.628 --> 09:09.089
That won't be a problem,
as long as we get something in return.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.634
I already offered you immunity
from Ilaria.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.677
I want the same for my followers.

09:13.845 --> 09:17.473
Ilaria stays off this island.
No persecution, no Narvik, nothing.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.682
I can arrange that.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.852
Plus a royalty on the sale
of the infertility apples, 10 percent.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.188
-Oh, come on.
-Make it 20.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.276
It looks like you're still Peter after all.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.704
He's been fed.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.998
It's time for his nap.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.798
Anne, gather the followers
in the counsel hall.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.174
Have them arm themselves.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.053
It's time to take care
of our CDC problem.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.932
Yes, Eli.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.615
-You sure you're okay, Dr. Kyle?
-I'm fine, Soren.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.451
Gotta get to the lab, help Dr. Jordan.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.997
But what about your My...?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.623
-Mycosis?
-Yeah.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.167
I'm getting better, just like you did.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.836
Dr. Alan fixed me.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.005
-I wanna fix people too.
-Is that right?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.549
Yeah. I can come work
with you at the CDC.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.968
I'd have you on my team anytime.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.388
Soren, I need to talk to Dr. Kyle, alone.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.475
-But I'm helping him.
-Now. Don't back-talk me.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.480
You need to get out of here now.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.317
-Out of where?
-The island. Get as far away as you can.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.236
Believe me, I'm trying.
What's going on?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.905
I don't want him to kill Alan,
you and Dr. Jordan.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.326
-"Him" who?
-Eli. Peter.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.829
-He won't let you leave the island alive.
-You heard him say that?

11:03.997 --> 11:08.542
He wants the cure. And once he gets it,
you're gonna end up in a barrel.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.045
I found this.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.757
There's a Coast Guard radio in there.
Call for help.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.925
Do whatever. Just get off the island.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.635
Why are you telling me this?

11:18.803 --> 11:22.848
You saved my Soren,
you and Dr. Alan.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.522
Doesn't seem possible.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.567
There's no scientific evidence
to explain it, but....

11:33.735 --> 11:34.735
Not yet.

11:34.903 --> 11:39.573
But it doesn't matter how.
The fact is, is that he's alive in this jar.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.117
And I need to find a way
to get him off this island.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.790
What kind of life is he gonna have?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.793
I don't know, but I am willing
to spend an eternity...

11:50.960 --> 11:54.254
...to figure out a way for him
to have a normal life.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.758
Why don't you come with me?

11:57.926 --> 12:00.761
If there's anybody who can help me
figure this out, it's you.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.055
Sarah, I can't.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.932
You can't?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.437
He's your son too.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.442
But you can't because of your obsession
with Ilaria and killing immortals.

12:15.610 --> 12:19.530
Well, why don't you start with me, Alan?
I'm standing here right in front of you.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.209
I have to finish what I started.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.586
I should've told you
I was going to see Dr. Kyle.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.630
No, no, no, Soren,
you didn't do anything wrong.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.008
Now, I need you to listen to me.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.634
Mommy made a terrible mistake.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.969
What did you do?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.847
I can't explain right now,
but I'm trying to fix it.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.349
So I need you to do something for me.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.685
Remember when we used
to play hide-and-seek?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.353
That spot you used to hide?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.647
But I don't want to hide.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.609
Dr. Kyle's my friend. I can help too.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.652
You can help by staying out of sight.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.199
Soren. Promise me.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.743
I promise.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.734
You scared me.

14:21.945 --> 14:27.491
I figured I'd find you up here
poring through 500 years of clues.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.493
Believe me, there's not much to find.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.702
What do you want, Alan?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.704
Actually, I came to apologize.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.166
I came at you pretty hard yesterday.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.417
It was unfair.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.545
I appreciate that.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.049
I'd like to help.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.343
You find anything of use?

14:49.305 --> 14:51.390
I'm not sure yet.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.768
This is a painting of the Mother Tree.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.980
I might be able to use reference points
to determine its location.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.732
Assuming the painting's true to life...

15:00.900 --> 15:03.360
...we have no way of knowing
if it's accurate.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.279
Well, Michael was a geneticist...

15:05.446 --> 15:07.948
...but over the centuries
he was also an artist...

15:08.116 --> 15:09.825
...a cartographer and an astronomer.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.868
Man had a lot of time on his hands.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.956
Landscapes change, mountains erode
and forests die...

15:16.124 --> 15:18.750
...but one thing stays the same.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.003
The stars.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.007
Do you remember that weekend
in Yosemite?

15:25.508 --> 15:27.801
-With the leaky tent.
-You said there was a way...

15:27.969 --> 15:31.263
...to use astronomical coordinates
to determine a precise location.

15:31.431 --> 15:36.101
-Declination and ascension, yeah.
-Right. You were showing off.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.522
I was trying to show you where
Ansel Adams shot Autumn Moon.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.400
You were trying to get me
back in the tent.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.406
What if there's a way to compare
the stars in the sky...

15:49.574 --> 15:51.575
-...to the painting?
-It's a good theory.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.328
But we have no idea
when this was painted.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.205
No, but that might only be
the difference of a few degrees.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.751
It could still give us an idea
of the tree's location.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.128
That's good work.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.797
Yeah.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.092
The work's just getting started.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.268
Sarah. Thank God you're here.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.687
We gotta pack up and get out.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.065
-What the hell is that?
-It's my son.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.233
Your what?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.443
When were you pregnant?

16:26.611 --> 16:27.944
-It was a--
-No, stop.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.697
You know what, you can explain it to me
on the way.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.991
Nothing on this island
surprises me anymore.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.786
-No, I'm not going anywhere.
-Sarah, please.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.829
-They're coming to kill us.
-Who?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.414
Peter's gone off the deep end.

16:39.582 --> 16:43.001
We gotta call for an evac or we're gonna
be scattered in that boneyard.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.427
Come on.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.305
-Come on, Sarah. We gotta go.
-Don't rush me.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.143
-Sarah, come on, please.
-Do not rush me.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.507
Too late. They're coming.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.654
Kyle, stop.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.573
We gotta keep moving. What's wrong?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.243
Something's leaking onto my back.

18:03.666 --> 18:07.002
No. It's leaking.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
What--? What are you doing?

18:22.185 --> 18:24.394
Juicy Fruit. There is no substitute.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.688
Did this with my fishbowl back home.

18:27.231 --> 18:31.151
Your goldfish was named Copernicus.
Mine was Aikman.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.612
-Figures.
-Yeah. That'll hold for a while.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.406
But we gotta get the hell up there,
call for an evac.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.076
No, no, he can't live inside a cracked jar.
I have to get him a new one.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.497
-Where we gonna find that?
-Amy said there are more in the Abbey.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.707
Since she's indisposed,
I have to find Anne.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.835
-You gotta be kidding. We gotta go.
-You can go if you want.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.464
But if I don't get him another jar
in 30 minutes, he's gonna die.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.927
Okay. We'll split up and find Anne.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.386
Meet back here, 30 minutes.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.349
-No, Kyle, you don't have to.
-I'm not leaving without you. Or your son.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.232
I barely recognize this place.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.028
It'll take time, but the island will heal.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.031
Incredible what nature can do
when left alone.

19:18.199 --> 19:22.160
Is that another Ilaria "save the planet"
talking point?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.579
Look out there, Alan.
It's the hand of man.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.248
It's what we do best, isn't it?

19:26.415 --> 19:28.500
Take something beautiful,
then destroy it?

19:28.668 --> 19:31.253
And Ilaria never destroyed anything?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.421
Only in service of the greater good.

19:35.216 --> 19:39.177
-Jesus. You can't believe that. Can you?
-Alan.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.472
It doesn't matter what I believe.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.141
There's no defeating Ilaria.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.852
They are everywhere.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.563
In every major city,
in every branch of government.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.856
I've seen their plans.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.694
Has it ever occurred to you
that they might be lying?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.071
-About what?
-Narvik-C.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.739
Think about it, Jules.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.658
Hatake needed several lifetimes...

20:01.826 --> 20:06.246
...to do what some genius at Ilaria
perfected in under a year?

20:08.875 --> 20:12.043
It's not just the beard, you've
really gone full conspiracy theorist.

20:13.379 --> 20:17.883
Look, I know this can't be easy for you.
It wasn't easy for me either.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.386
Well, that's the thing. It was too easy.

20:23.764 --> 20:28.226
I killed all those immortals for you, Jules.

20:28.394 --> 20:32.147
And I'd have killed 10,000 more for you.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.568
You were the one, Alan.

20:37.737 --> 20:42.032
You're the closest I came to knowing
anyone and I tried to let you know me too.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.909
But there was just something missing.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.995
-I was missing.
-No. It wasn't you.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.373
You wanna believe you could've done
something to change things. It's me.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.709
It's what I am.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.671
My father, Hatake, immortality.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.676
Arctic Biosystems was the worst and
best thing that ever happened to me...

21:01.844 --> 21:03.929
...because I finally made sense.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.630
He's asleep.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.677
The CDC doctors have fled.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.056
-And the cure?
-We scoured the entire lab.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.141
They must have taken it with them.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.310
I'm so sorry. I should've known.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.189
Don't apologize. I'm not Michael.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.900
You could never disappoint me.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.995
-Someone must have warned them.
-But who would do such a thing?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.247
No one else knew--

22:15.584 --> 22:17.002
Olivia.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.462
She was in the room with us.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.548
What do you want me to do?

22:21.716 --> 22:24.718
Keep the search going for the CDC.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.302
I'll handle everything else.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.435
Show no mercy.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.439
Show no mercy.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.710
Okay, where are you, Polaris?

22:58.878 --> 23:01.004
Find the Big Dipper.

23:01.172 --> 23:05.258
And from those two pointer stars
at five times the distance.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.803
There she is, the North Star.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.057
This can't be right.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.269
-Well, maybe it's just a painting, Jules.
-I combed through Michael's files.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.397
He was meticulous about his work,
almost obsessive.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.232
Why would he be different on this?

23:21.650 --> 23:25.278
So we have the star, where's the hill?

23:25.446 --> 23:26.946
It's there.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.202
It's almost as if....

23:33.204 --> 23:36.498
I assumed we were at the vantage point,
but I got it backwards.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.920
The star, the hill,
the triangulation point...

23:42.630 --> 23:43.963
...it's not the steeple.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.758
The tree's here at the Abbey.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.354
I think there's someone over here.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.315
All clear.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.257
All clear.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.144
Eli.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.899
You seem nervous, Olivia.
Is anything wrong?

24:45.067 --> 24:50.071
No. I just really want to find my Soren,
make sure he's okay.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.324
If you care about your son...

24:54.285 --> 24:57.579
...why risk everything by telling the CDC
we were coming for them?

24:58.289 --> 25:00.999
No, Eli, I would never betray you.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.169
There's no need to lie.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.421
That will only make it worse.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.388
Please, I just want to be with my son.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.976
-Please, I just want to be with him.
-I know you do.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.023
Olivia, I know.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.259
I'm sorry...

25:54.094 --> 25:56.596
...but we gotta go
before they come back.

26:03.604 --> 26:06.981
-Soren.
-Why did he kill my mom?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.817
No reason.

26:10.277 --> 26:13.404
He's just an evil man
who did a terrible thing.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.991
He's a doctor, like you.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.785
He's supposed to fix people.

26:18.953 --> 26:22.455
Sometimes people pretend
to be someone they're not.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.959
I don't want to pretend.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.795
I want to be someone else.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.130
No one deserves
what you've been through.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.801
And after all I did to you,
you still saved me and Alan.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.553
I'd say that makes you
the bravest person I've ever met.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.014
I'm not brave.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.308
I could've saved her,
but I was too scared.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.935
Soren.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.729
You listen to me. Listen.

26:47.231 --> 26:51.484
None of this is your fault.
You hear me? None of it.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.198
I lost my mom too...

26:57.908 --> 27:00.076
...when I was just a few years older
than you.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.829
I still think about her every day.

27:02.997 --> 27:05.957
That way she's always with me,
no matter what.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.294
But my mom was my only family...

27:09.461 --> 27:11.462
...and now I'm all alone.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.050
I'll be your family now, if you want.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.822
I'll check over here.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.699
I'll take this side.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.286
They're not here.

27:43.454 --> 27:46.664
Split up and circle the grounds.
The doctors can't have gone far.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.604
Put it down.

28:10.481 --> 28:11.856
Not one word.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.608
I understand.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.902
Now, what do you want, Dr. Jordan?

28:16.070 --> 28:19.364
Michael's premature-baby experiments,
where are the life-support units?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.575
-Why?
-Because I'm the one holding the knife.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.787
There's no need to threaten me.
Just settle down.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.288
Sit.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.167
Where are they?

28:32.002 --> 28:35.421
-If I refuse to say?
-You're gonna tell me one way or another.

28:38.967 --> 28:43.638
This place is so beautiful. Michael built
himself a shrine to Mother Nature.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.599
Hard to believe somebody
capable of so much beauty...

28:46.767 --> 28:49.477
...could be responsible
for so many horrors.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.437
More common than you'd think.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.689
What was he like?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.775
Michael, what kind of man was he?

28:55.943 --> 28:57.735
Loved the sound of his own voice.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.155
-A narcissist?
-A lunatic.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.075
But he did have a gift for oratory.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.454
Hell for Michael was a room
without an audience.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.008
Jules, what are we doing?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.635
The tree's not here.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.303
Is this where he would speak?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.557
He called it counseling.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.631
Jules, what the hell are you--?

30:06.763 --> 30:09.223
-Help me.
-Help you what?

30:09.391 --> 30:11.309
Help me pull up this floor.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.456
The Mother Tree.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.210
Michael built the Abbey
right on top of it.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.796
He must have had some way
to access its roots.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.467
There's an extensive tunnel system
under the Abbey...

30:44.635 --> 30:46.719
...but we don't have a painting
to guide us.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.930
Good thing I have you.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.066
Where are they?

31:00.234 --> 31:04.111
If you turn yourself over to Eli,
he may show you mercy.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.198
-Who's Eli?
-You knew him as Peter Farragut.

31:10.077 --> 31:13.162
-Peter is a lot of things.
-And he will be so much more...

31:13.330 --> 31:14.580
...to so many people.

31:15.666 --> 31:16.707
You're serious.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.587
It's no wonder that Amy
turned out the way that she did.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.756
You have no idea
what it is to be a parent.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.509
-I am a parent.
-No. You're not.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.262
-That thing there is not a child.
-Shut up.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.722
And keeping it like that
is cruel and pointless.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.934
If I hear one more word
that isn't the location of those jars--

31:35.102 --> 31:38.354
Why don't you put that away?
We both know you won't use it.

31:41.942 --> 31:43.359
Oh, really?

31:55.872 --> 31:57.999
What the hell is this place?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.919
This is where Michael bestowed...

32:02.087 --> 32:05.381
...his greatest gift upon the world.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.342
The gift of life.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.667
What have you done to them?

32:41.835 --> 32:43.544
Their throats, their voices.

32:44.171 --> 32:47.048
Only in silence could they find peace.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.307
Where are the life-support units?

32:58.143 --> 32:59.185
Where are they?

33:14.493 --> 33:17.995
-Release them. All of them.
-I will not.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.248
You can do it with half your toes
or none at all.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.437
When I was a boy...

33:44.147 --> 33:47.775
...I used to dream they made
a mistake at the hospital...

33:47.943 --> 33:49.985
...and they switched babies.

33:51.697 --> 33:56.701
I used to pray that I didn't
actually belong to that family...

33:57.828 --> 33:59.537
...to that man.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.714
Now I understand
that blood is meaningless.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.344
You are my son...

34:15.887 --> 34:17.722
...my family.

34:23.437 --> 34:27.857
Years of med school couldn't teach me
what you did in just one day.

34:29.234 --> 34:33.446
DNA, RNA, the building blocks....

34:34.156 --> 34:36.532
That's not what it is to be human...

34:36.700 --> 34:38.826
...what it means to be a man...

34:40.454 --> 34:41.996
...a father.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.631
It's all the things we can't see
that make us who we are.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.426
Love...

34:55.969 --> 34:57.386
...hope.

35:01.516 --> 35:05.853
I will give you everything
my father didn't give me.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.485
Blood is meaningless.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.820
Family...

35:15.530 --> 35:17.323
...is everything.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.594
Oh, my God.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.973
This is unbelievable.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.018
We're inside the root system of a tree.

36:04.037 --> 36:07.414
-Come on.
-The tree's dead, Jules.

36:08.291 --> 36:12.169
-Probably been dead for generations.
-An organism this big?

36:12.337 --> 36:15.297
There are root systems
that have been alive for 80,000 years.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.925
Trees, not stumps.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.802
You're too late.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.476
Mayday, Mayday.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.812
This is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC.

36:29.980 --> 36:34.149
Requesting immediate evacuation
from St. Germain Island. Do you copy?

36:37.279 --> 36:39.864
Mayday, Mayday,
this is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the--

36:40.407 --> 36:42.366
Sarah? Did you find Anne?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.743
-I found her.
-Did you get her to talk?

36:44.911 --> 36:45.953
She talked.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.664
What happened?

36:48.832 --> 36:50.457
Whose blood is that?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.963
I'll tell you after about five years
of therapy.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.510
Mayday, Mayday, this is
Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC.

37:01.678 --> 37:05.097
Requesting immediate evacuation
from St. Germain Island.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.099
Does anybody copy?

37:10.937 --> 37:14.189
This is the USS Portledge.
You are on a priority military channel.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.691
Sign off immediately.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.902
This is Dr. Kyle Sommer.
We need an evac.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.362
I don't care who you are.
Switch your frequency.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.908
Listen up, I have the cure for
the pathogen that's infecting your ships.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.786
If you want it, you better put somebody
on the line that can get me an evac.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.917
Hold for Captain Wilson.

38:03.573 --> 38:06.367
Anne. Oh, my God.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.621
What happened?

38:13.375 --> 38:14.583
Who did this to you?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.962
-Who?
-Dr. Jordan.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.588
Sarah?

38:21.383 --> 38:24.843
She made me take her
to the birthing chamber.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.721
-We need to get you to the infirmary.
-No.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.057
You have to stop her and Dr. Sommer.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.892
They're trying to leave the island.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.604
Where are they now?

38:47.492 --> 38:49.326
No, no, no.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.663
-What happened?
-The vials are broken. I don't have more.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.207
Well, then there's nothing you can do.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.253
Look. Do you see this?

39:00.839 --> 39:03.007
The fungal enzyme.
It spilled into the ground.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.217
Do you know what this means?

39:07.053 --> 39:10.264
It's Mother. She's everywhere.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.943
All right. Soren, you go first.
Then you, Sarah.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.168
We're taking fire! Hang on!

39:41.254 --> 39:43.130
-Come back!
-No!

39:44.466 --> 39:45.924
Come back!

39:57.020 --> 39:58.604
The fungus...

39:59.189 --> 40:01.732
...it's in the soil around the roots.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.275
But you don't have the root.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.653
I don't need it. Mother was just
a repository for the fungus.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.657
With modern gene-splicing, we can insert
the fungus into any plant we want.

40:10.825 --> 40:14.953
We can create widespread infertility
without any Mycotic effects.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.290
This is incredible.
We can create seeds, plantings...

40:18.458 --> 40:20.834
...whole orchards in the span
of a few years.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.837
This will eliminate the need for Narvik.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.342
I'm sorry, Jules.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.554
Alan, what are you doing?

40:34.015 --> 40:35.849
Stopping Ilaria.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.311
By killing me?

40:41.022 --> 40:42.648
I'm trying to stop them too.

40:43.608 --> 40:44.900
No.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.029
If you do this,
you're as bad as they are.

40:50.240 --> 40:53.909
Alan, you're making a huge mistake.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.494
Please.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.746
You have to let me go.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.625
I can't.
