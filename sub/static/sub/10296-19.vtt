I don't know.

Go out and play.

01:28.968 --> 01:30.601
What are you hiding?

01:30.601 --> 01:33.334
Nothing.

01:33.334 --> 01:36.334
You have food there.
I know it.

01:36.334 --> 01:37.868
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.901
Tang residue.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.968
You glutton.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.334
Ah, another great morning.

01:45.334 --> 01:47.834
Didn't sleep at all last night

01:47.834 --> 01:50.334
with Steve's
stupid car alarm going off.

01:50.334 --> 01:52.334
Off course, then
that wakes up your mother,

01:52.334 --> 01:54.033
and I got to talk to her.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.334
You almost lost your daddy
last night, kids.

01:59.334 --> 02:00.634
What are you hiding?

02:03.801 --> 02:05.167
Nothing.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.334
Finished off the Tang
on me again, eh?

02:07.334 --> 02:08.934
Well,

02:08.934 --> 02:11.934
your dad still has
a few tricks left

02:11.934 --> 02:13.868
in his tired old body.

02:19.934 --> 02:21.868
Tang wipe.

02:25.934 --> 02:28.167
Good morning, everyone.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.300
Boy, am I stuffed.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.334
You know,
you've just got to try

02:32.334 --> 02:34.534
that slam dunk breakfast
at Kippy's.

02:34.534 --> 02:37.133
Pancakes, bacon,
sausage, eggs.

02:37.133 --> 02:41.634
I finally had to say stop,
I can't eat anymore.

02:41.634 --> 02:44.033
Peg, what do you do

02:44.033 --> 02:46.033
with all the money
I give you for food?

02:46.033 --> 02:48.934
I just told you.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

02:49.934 --> 02:51.033
Peg, you want to get that?

02:51.033 --> 02:52.534
It's probably the homeless

02:52.534 --> 02:54.434
on their
"It Could Be Worse" tour.

02:59.501 --> 03:02.501
Hi. I just stopped by
to apologize

03:02.501 --> 03:05.033
if Steve's car alarm
kept you up last night.

03:05.033 --> 03:06.367
He's out of town,

03:06.367 --> 03:09.534
and it's his first night away
from his new Mercedes,

03:09.534 --> 03:11.534
so he set his alarm
on ultra-sensitive.

03:11.534 --> 03:15.033
The slightest touch,
and it goes off all night.

03:15.033 --> 03:18.067
Does it have
a brother?

03:18.067 --> 03:21.200
Look, I'm sorry,
but you can't blame him.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.200
It's a magnificent
piece of machinery.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.567
So how does it drive?

03:25.567 --> 03:28.667
How should I know?
He won't let me near it.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.234
Well, consider
yourself lucky.

03:30.234 --> 03:33.734
The thing you can't touch
is in the garage.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.200
Mine is in the bedroom.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.467
Mom, Bud found
a corn flake

03:38.467 --> 03:40.968
between the refrigerator
and the sink,

03:40.968 --> 03:42.801
and he won't share.

03:42.801 --> 03:44.267
Aw, this is ridiculous.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.667
Come on, kids,

03:45.667 --> 03:47.667
this may be against
everything I believe in,

03:47.667 --> 03:49.467
but I'm taking you
out to breakfast.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.968
Oh!
All right!

03:50.968 --> 03:52.567
Now, kids,
when we get to the restaurant,

03:52.567 --> 03:53.968
something strange will happen.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.501
A woman will bring you food.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.901
Now, uh...

03:58.901 --> 04:00.033
don't be scared.

04:00.033 --> 04:01.901
She's called a waitress.

04:01.901 --> 04:06.100
That's just God's
alternative to mommies.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.467
Boy, squabbling over a meal--

04:08.467 --> 04:10.734
thank God,
Steve's a liberated man

04:10.734 --> 04:12.033
and cooks for me.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.701
Why don't you cook
for the family, Al?

04:14.701 --> 04:17.733
Mom, no! Please!

04:17.733 --> 04:19.434
Do you remember
last summer?

04:19.434 --> 04:20.834
Tortilla night?

04:20.834 --> 04:22.501
And the resulting
plumbing problem?

04:22.501 --> 04:24.767
And I thought you loved us.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.934
Come on, Dad.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.400
I don't know why those tortillas
exploded like that.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.033
You know, sometimes
I get so mad

04:34.033 --> 04:36.167
I could just
kill that man.

04:36.167 --> 04:39.100
I like to think
that I am.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.234
I meant Steve.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.834
Peggy, when Al got his new car,
did he let you drive it?

04:43.834 --> 04:44.968
A few times.

04:44.968 --> 04:46.801
Once, he had no brakes,

04:46.801 --> 04:49.567
and someone had to take it
to the mechanic.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.434
Listen, Peggy,
can I borrow your car

04:51.434 --> 04:53.133
to go to
the supermarket?

04:53.133 --> 04:55.167
My car doesn't go there.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.067
What's wrong with your car?

04:57.067 --> 04:59.234
It's in the shop.

04:59.234 --> 05:00.634
Just take his car.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.133
It's your car too.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.133
Look, don't let him
start thinking

05:04.133 --> 05:06.133
he can have things
of his own.

05:06.133 --> 05:08.467
It's the road to ruin.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.467
You know,
it's taken me 16 years,

05:10.467 --> 05:16.133
but I am proud to say
that Al finally has nothing.

05:16.133 --> 05:19.133
Just go for a ride
in your Mercedes, Marce.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.334
I don't know.

05:20.334 --> 05:22.133
I'd have to change
the seat and the mirrors.

05:22.133 --> 05:24.634
It took him weeks
to set them just right.

05:24.634 --> 05:29.334
What do you care
what he wants?

05:29.334 --> 05:32.667
Look, Al doesn't like me
blowing smoke in his eggs.

05:32.667 --> 05:36.934
What am I supposed to do?
Stop smoking?

05:36.934 --> 05:37.934
You're right.

05:37.934 --> 05:39.033

for a drive.

I'm going to do?

05:44.534 --> 05:47.534
Change all the preset
stations on his radio.

05:47.534 --> 05:50.534
He's an idiot.
It is my car too.

I'm going to do?

05:53.033 --> 05:54.567

in reverse,

to a complete stop.

10:51.501 --> 10:53.000
The important thing
is Marcie's okay.

a car, right?

like an egg!

You see, Al,

11:17.334 --> 11:18.634
There was no screaming

11:18.634 --> 11:20.300
over at Steve and Marcie's
last night.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.667

11:31.567 --> 11:34.200
Well, Steve forgave me.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.734
He's the most wonderful
man in the world.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.734

more like Steve?

Al, you are like Steve.

Oh, Marcie.
It's only one night.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.000
Give it a reasonable
period of time.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.167
You know, back in '74,

12:07.167 --> 12:08.934
I thought Al
had that problem.

12:08.934 --> 12:11.767
but by '79,
it cleared up fine.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.868
But Steve
is Mr. Ever-ready.

12:19.267 --> 12:22.267
And we tried
six times last night.

Six times in one night?

Hey, give me some credit.

12:29.501 --> 12:32.701
I can fail six times too.

never failed before.
