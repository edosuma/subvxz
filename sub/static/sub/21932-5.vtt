00:47.348 --> 00:49.347
The pace of change is incredible.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.750
The Temple Building is
twelve storeys high!

00:51.752 --> 00:54.019
Progress in motion, I suppose.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.054
When was the last time
you were in Toronto?

00:56.123 --> 01:00.225
Well, nearly 10 years ago now.
Speaking of the pace of change.

01:00.227 --> 01:04.029
- How have the lectures been?
- There is always some

01:04.098 --> 01:06.031
resistance when it comes to
the discussion of aging,

01:06.067 --> 01:08.066
I find.
People are generally uncomfortable

01:08.135 --> 01:10.402
- discussing mortality.
- And...

01:10.470 --> 01:13.572
- experiencing it, I'd wager.
- But your lectures

01:13.640 --> 01:17.175
are more about the stigma
of aging, are they not?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.711
In part. Far too many people

01:19.713 --> 01:21.713
as we grow old, we weaken in both

01:21.781 --> 01:24.382
body and mind.
This recent outrage

01:24.385 --> 01:26.718
in the newspapers is a
perfect example of that.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.188
I saw the headlines.
There is an air of frenzy about them.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.192
Yes, well...

01:34.195 --> 01:36.194
"In Dr William Osler's
lecture at the University

01:36.263 --> 01:38.664
of Toronto, he put forth
an audacious theory

01:38.732 --> 01:41.133
that men over 60 should be euthanized

01:41.135 --> 01:43.735
with chloroform."

01:43.804 --> 01:46.138
Well, it's a...

01:46.206 --> 01:48.807
- bold assertion.
- I was being facetious,

01:48.809 --> 01:51.776
of course. Now every paper
on the continent is printing

01:51.845 --> 01:53.612
this falsehood as fact.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.148
Perhaps you should write a
letter clarifying your position.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.049
Oh, I can't imagine
that'll be necessary.

01:58.118 --> 02:02.120
It's sensationalist nonsense.
Now, enough of that.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.423
I'm so pleased to see how
far you've come, Julia.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.626
Due in no small part to you.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.928
For a time at McGill,

02:09.996 --> 02:12.698
I considered leaving
medical school entirely.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.799
Dr Osler encouraged me to continue,

02:14.802 --> 02:17.636
reinvigorated my interest in medicine.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.405
Oh! I didn't know that.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.374
You just needed a bit of prodding,
from what I remember.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.910
A gifted student.
And I would

02:24.978 --> 02:27.646
be remiss if I didn't ask such a
handsome couple about children.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.782
- Oh...
- Oh... unfortunately,

02:30.850 --> 02:32.784
that hasn't been in the cards for us.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.820
- Do you have children, Doctor?
- A boy, Edward.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.591
- And how is Mrs Osler?
- Oh, fine form.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.626
Dr Osler's wife

02:41.695 --> 02:43.628
is the great-granddaughter
of Paul Revere.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.997
- Is that right?
- Yes, yes,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.602
quite an accomplishment,
riding a horse for an entire evening.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.340
Osler!
Murderer!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.275
You killed him!
You killed my father!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.811
- Calm yourself sir!
- He killed my father!

02:59.879 --> 03:02.381
That bastard murdered my father!

03:13.460 --> 03:15.360
Perhaps Dr Osler didn't
realize the influence

03:15.429 --> 03:17.362
his words would have.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.365
He's been here for some time,
by the looks of it.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.702
- For at least eight hours.
- Norman.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.338
Oh my poor, sweet Norman.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.707
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.710
My husband would never

03:31.712 --> 03:34.145
do this to himself.
Please, believe me.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.147
We will investigate

03:36.216 --> 03:39.050
- every avenue, I assure you.
- Detective, please.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.754
My son, Archie,
he wouldn't have hurt Dr Osler.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.256
He was just emotional.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.659
He and Norman had been arguing. I know

03:47.661 --> 03:49.961
that he blames himself for this...

03:50.030 --> 03:53.565
We'll be keeping him overnight. I'll
have a word with him in the morning.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.902
Excuse me.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.038
What is it?

04:02.342 --> 04:04.343
This window latch is broken.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.612
The window appears to have
been jimmied from the outside.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.681
Mrs Doyle, do you know
anything about this?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.750
I've never noticed it before.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.552
William...

04:25.131 --> 04:26.965
Perhaps this wasn't a suicide after all.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.182
Put it in the jar behind you.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.184
Heavier than I would have thought.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.920
So what do you think?

04:48.988 --> 04:51.956
Are you able to finish here?
Stitch him up?

04:52.025 --> 04:54.793
Of course. I used to stitch
up my brothers all the time.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.695
If I can stitch them up
while they're squirming,

04:56.763 --> 04:58.596
I'm sure I can do it
while they're still.

04:58.665 --> 05:02.067
So Dr Osler was your teacher.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.438
This was some time ago, but yes.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.875
I must confess, I'm not quite certain
what his contributions have been.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.244
Oh, there are a great many,

05:12.312 --> 05:15.413
chief among them is his
belief in not only treating

05:15.482 --> 05:17.482
the disease, but also caring

05:17.551 --> 05:19.784
for the patient as well.
It's quite a departure

05:19.853 --> 05:22.153
from the singular nature
of traditional medicine.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.622
So is counseling old people
to take their own lives.

05:24.625 --> 05:28.126
That was twisted
completely out of context.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.729
It was never meant to
be taken seriously.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.898
Actually, I thought there
was some validity to it.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.734
- How so?
- Well, people in their

05:35.736 --> 05:38.370
later days can be a drain
on a family's resources.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.172
Perhaps allowing the aged
to choose their final day

05:41.241 --> 05:43.174
is a... compassionate act.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.477
There may be some truth in that,

05:45.545 --> 05:47.645
but that is not the role of a doctor.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.115
Our job is to do no harm.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.755
This is madness.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.656
That poor man.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.693
I should never have made such a
callous remark, even in jest...

06:01.761 --> 06:04.129
Actually, Doctor, we believe

06:04.197 --> 06:06.798
it may have been murder.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.367
So the killer staged the suicide?

06:09.370 --> 06:11.636
- So it would seem.
- How depraved.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.773
Not to worry, doctor.
Even if the story had been the catalyst,

06:14.841 --> 06:17.008
the man was getting quite old.
Probably didn't have far

06:17.077 --> 06:18.943
to go till the end, anyway.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.079
You and I are rapidly
approaching that final curtain

06:21.148 --> 06:23.782
- ourselves, Inspector.
- Is that so?

06:23.850 --> 06:26.685
By the time a man hits 40,
he's on the decline.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.686
There is not a medicine in the world

06:28.755 --> 06:30.689
that can cure that.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.097
Mr Doyle.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.366
Ahem.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.635
If you could please describe the events

06:43.637 --> 06:45.670
leading up to the discovery
of your father's body.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.840
I went over to the house last night

06:48.909 --> 06:51.376
to discuss a business matter.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.546
- You were in business together?
- Doyle's Footgear.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.383
When I arrived, there was no answer.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.385
I entered,
I found him

07:00.387 --> 07:02.320
lying dead. I saw the chloroform,

07:02.322 --> 07:04.389
I saw the newspaper,
and I knew what happened.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.524
I read the story myself.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.660
Where was your mother?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.429
With her church group, I believe.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.032
She said my father didn't want

07:14.034 --> 07:16.501
to get out of bed that day.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.570
Was this a regular occurrence?

07:18.638 --> 07:20.772
Yes.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.177
His spirit had been dampened.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.079
Tempered, after turning 60.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.748
Often, he would slip

07:30.751 --> 07:32.750
into these dark moods,

07:32.753 --> 07:35.754
sometimes refusing to leave
the house for days at a time.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.356
That must have been quite trying.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.092
For my mother, especially.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.895
He confided in me

07:43.963 --> 07:46.832
that... he was afraid
of becoming useless.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.167
I think that article

07:49.236 --> 07:51.035
is what pushed him over the edge.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.571
Your mother mentioned

07:53.640 --> 07:56.107
an argument you and your
father had recently.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.844
It was also a business matter.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.912
She seemed to think it was

08:00.981 --> 08:02.914
part of the reason why
you were so upset.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.317
I was upset because I'd
found my father dead,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.520
and I knew that Osler was the cause.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.589
Why are you asking me this?

08:10.657 --> 08:13.191
Mr Doyle, we have reason to believe

08:13.193 --> 08:16.294
that your father's death may
not have been a suicide.

08:16.362 --> 08:19.231
But... but I saw with my own eyes.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.035
Do you know of anyone who
may have wished him harm?

08:31.411 --> 08:34.846
His old partner,
Oliver Linehan.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.416
They had a falling out a few years ago,
before my father brought me in.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.885
He always threatened he'd ruin us.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.255
He even threatened violence,
if I recall.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.496
Hello, George Crabtree.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.365
Miss Cherry.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.569
This has gone long enough.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.938
I harbour no animosity towards you,

09:00.006 --> 09:02.106
and I hope you bear none towards me.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.009
No, of course not.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.378
I'd like to move on.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.247
As professionals.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.588
I heard Dr Osler is here.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.456
I'd very much like to speak with him.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.325
I can't imagine he feels the same way,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.193
not after what the newspapers
have been printing

09:22.261 --> 09:23.995
- about him lately.
- Is it true that a man

09:24.064 --> 09:26.197
committed suicide because
of the doctor's comments?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.800
- I can't say.
- Just a quote.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.668
Why don't you wait until the
investigation is finished

09:30.737 --> 09:32.504
before continuing with this?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.875
You always were a stickler,
George Crabtree.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.145
Only when it comes to the truth.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.980
The truth?

09:42.048 --> 09:43.615
People infer the truth.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.884
Please, if I could only
speak with him for a moment,

09:46.953 --> 09:50.021
it's an international story.
It would mean a great deal

09:50.023 --> 09:52.691
- to me.
- Louise, I can't help you.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.735
Mr Linehan, you and Mr Doyle

10:03.803 --> 10:05.737
were business partners, is that right?

10:05.805 --> 10:09.240
Yeah. We started our company
together nearly 20 years ago.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.075
Made a good go at it.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.910
Became quite successful.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.013
What happened?

10:15.081 --> 10:18.583
I wanted to change the way
we produced our shoes,

10:18.585 --> 10:20.952
he wouldn't consider it.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.954
Stubborn old buzzard!

10:23.022 --> 10:26.391
- I see.
- We dissolved the partnership,

10:26.393 --> 10:28.193
but the division of the assets

10:28.261 --> 10:30.061
fell heavily in his favor.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.230
That was no accident.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.732
I was left with next to nothing.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.468
Did you threaten him?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.337
Oh, multiple times.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.539
But I started my own company instead.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.142
Linehan Soles. And I made it my mission

10:44.210 --> 10:46.344
to destroy his company.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.413
Our company.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.648
Were you successful?

10:50.717 --> 10:52.717
I surpassed him

10:52.785 --> 10:54.653
very quickly in sales.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.422
That was my revenge.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.563
- Doctor! Oh, won't you join us?
- Just a drink;

11:05.565 --> 11:07.465
I've lost my appetite. Look at this.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.303
It proposes that I was the impetus

11:12.371 --> 11:14.405
behind the man's suicide.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.607
This journalist doesn't
realize he was murdered.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.543
I know the woman who wrote this.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.945
A ploy to sell more papers,
it would seem.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.181
Well, clearly it's working.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.250
Tonight I was booed at my lecture,

11:25.318 --> 11:29.287
and the university has canceled
the remainder of the engagements.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.256
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.591
I know how horrible it is to
be attacked in the press.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.593
This matter will be resolved quickly,

11:35.662 --> 11:37.662
and the record will be set straight.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.664
Don't misunderstand me; I realize

11:39.732 --> 11:42.333
mine isn't the tragic
role in this story.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.335
But what an odd thing,

11:44.404 --> 11:46.271
to be completely powerless

11:46.339 --> 11:48.606
as to the way the world views you.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.022
So you think it's

12:04.090 --> 12:06.024
- this Linehan fellow, then?
- Possibly.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.093
Their dispute is years old, though.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.495
- What about the son, Archie?
- He has shown

12:10.563 --> 12:12.630
a propensity for violence.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.465
- But you're not sure.
- Well sir,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.834
he seemed genuinely
devastated at the loss.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.104
- Many a killer is, Murdoch.
- Sirs, I spoke

12:20.107 --> 12:22.373
to some of the employees
at the Doyle factory.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.710
I think the argument
between Archie and Norman

12:25.712 --> 12:27.912
was worse than Archie let on.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.581
- Apparently threats were made.
- What sort?

12:30.650 --> 12:33.050
Well, someone said
that they heard Archie

12:33.053 --> 12:36.587
threaten to smother Norman in his sleep.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.056
Right.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.192
George, bring Mr Doyle back in.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.528
- Sir.
- There you have it.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.530
Right then.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.532
I'm nipping out for a couple of hours.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.333
Gotta go and see a man about a dog.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.204
Are you all right, Inspector?

12:53.272 --> 12:56.007
I'm fine.
Did a few sets

12:56.075 --> 12:59.177
of press-ups this morning.
It gets the old blood flowing.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.147
I set a new personal best.
Honestly Murdoch, I feel

13:02.215 --> 13:04.749
- I'm getting stronger with age.
- Well sir,

13:04.818 --> 13:06.684
- biologically that is a...
- That'll do, Murdoch.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.489
You threatened to kill him.
It was overheard.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.091
You think I murdered my own father?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.094
Is this what passes for police work

13:16.162 --> 13:18.029
these days? This is outrageous!

13:18.097 --> 13:20.798
- Sit down, Mr Doyle.
- There is a killer out there!

13:20.867 --> 13:23.935
Sit down,
Mr Doyle.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.416
Please.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.653
We argued about the company.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.724
The future of the industry is in glue.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.093
- Glue?
- As opposed to stitching.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.463
Glue is less expensive
to produce, and faster.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.900
But father wouldn't hear about it.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.469
You insisted on making the change,

13:58.537 --> 14:00.671
he refused, it got heated.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.741
I went over to the house
that night to apologize.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.677
That's when I found him.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.848
At first I was afraid that he...

14:09.883 --> 14:13.618
that he had done what he did
because of our argument.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.786
And then I saw the newspaper there.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.656
That's when you went after Dr Osler.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.691
I was blind with rage.

14:22.696 --> 14:26.297
What is it?

14:26.365 --> 14:29.333
Miles Borden,
sir, age 65.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.168
Everything seems to be quite the same.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.071
The chloroform,
the newspaper,

14:33.139 --> 14:35.439
the victim's vintage. Roughly.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.509
- He was a clock maker?
- No, a lawyer, in fact.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.979
This seems to be something
of a hobby of his.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.381
- Some impressive work though.
- Really?

14:43.449 --> 14:45.316
Yes, well some of the pieces

14:45.385 --> 14:47.252
on the mantel here are
particularly sophisticated.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
Did you know, sir, that I'm a bit

14:49.322 --> 14:51.389
of an amateur horologist myself?

14:51.457 --> 14:53.658
I made this pocket watch I'm carrying.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.593
- You made this, George?
- Yes sir.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.195
Does it work?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.831
Yes.
Well...

15:00.900 --> 15:04.068
at least twice a day.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.270
Hm.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.773
No evidence of forced entry.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.609
No blood, no sign of a struggle.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.279
Perhaps this really was a suicide.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
Look at that.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.487
Some sort of discolouration.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.990
Bruising,
George.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.592
Chloroform was held
forcefully over his mouth.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.528
This man was also murdered.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.980
Bruising indicates the
cloth was held forcefully.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.516
Two of his fingernails were broken,

15:51.584 --> 15:54.118
suggesting he was fighting back.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.187
So two murders made to
look like suicides.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.990
Both made to appear inspired

15:59.058 --> 16:01.859
- by Dr Osler's comments.
- What's the connection?

16:01.927 --> 16:04.328
Aside from their ages,
none that we know of yet.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.732
- Could be a sequential killer.
- But what is the motive?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.067
Both men in their 60s.
Both still working.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.336
Perhaps the killer's sending a message.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.540
Maybe that old people shouldn't work?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.376
Miss Violet Hart, allow me to introduce

16:18.444 --> 16:21.746
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid
and Detective William Murdoch.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.748
Miss Hart will be
assisting me in the morgue

16:23.750 --> 16:25.816
for the foreseeable future.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.785
Your theories on the elderly
are way off, young lady.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.089
Detective Murdoch.
I've heard quite a bit about you.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.692
It's an honour.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.694
How do you do.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.729
I'll ask George to look
into their records.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.664
We can't discount the possibility

16:40.733 --> 16:42.700
that there's some connection. Ladies.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.769
Inspector.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.704
I taught him everything he knows.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.607
I heard that, sir.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.380
- Hello, George.
- Miss Cherry.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.382
I'm in a bit of a rush, I'm afraid.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.918
Is it true there's been
another Osler-related suicide?

17:00.986 --> 17:02.920
Miss Cherry,

17:02.989 --> 17:04.954
sometimes the way that
you ask a question,

17:05.023 --> 17:06.957
it's impossible to answer.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.292
Well, is it true?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.929
They were both murders.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.632
The killer, or killers,
masked them up to look like suicides.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.635
You would do well to be more
careful about what you write.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.703
I didn't realize you were such
an authority on journalism.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.739
Just a piece of advice.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.141
I was quite disappointed things didn't

17:24.210 --> 17:27.377
work out between us.
But then, as now,

17:27.446 --> 17:29.947
I was simply doing my job.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.849
Crabtree.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.452
- Sir.
- What did Nosy Nelly want?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.454
- Sir, just fishing.
- Hmm.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.489
Where are you off to now?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.591
Oh, joining these two on their beat.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.227
Fresh air and a long walk.
Affirmation of life, eh lads?

17:45.198 --> 17:47.531
- Are you all right, sir?
- Just a few too many curl-ups.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.500
Right. Let's crack on, lads.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.203
..Curl-ups.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.849
Detective Murdoch?
Jack Borden.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.585
Ah, Mr Borden, thank you for coming in.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.522
Please, have a seat.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.692
My sympathies for the
loss of your uncle.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.727
Are there any suspects?

18:16.795 --> 18:19.263
We're investigating all possibilities.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.800
What can you tell me about him?

18:22.869 --> 18:25.670
Uncle Miles was a great man.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.605
Caring, highly intelligent,

18:27.673 --> 18:29.474
generous to a fault.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.642
- A fault?
- Yes. He was always

18:31.710 --> 18:34.378
taking on cases for free,
helping out those

18:34.446 --> 18:38.449
less fortunate, however he could.
More so as time went on.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.351
You worked together?

18:40.419 --> 18:42.253
We were partners.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.221
We run...

18:44.224 --> 18:47.425
ran our own law firm.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.796
I returned from a business trip
yesterday, I assumed I'd see him

18:52.865 --> 18:56.501
in his office this morning.
This is devastating.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.237
Of course.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.839
This may sound odd...

19:01.841 --> 19:04.241
are you certain it wasn't suicide?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.878
Quite certain.
Why do you ask?

19:06.946 --> 19:10.548
It's just Miles was
always so full of life.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.551
Verve. But he changed when he turned 60.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.154
It's as if a dark cloud
were following him.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.389
That's when he started
with those damned clocks.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.925
- Ah. Yes, I noticed.
- He joked

19:20.927 --> 19:22.927
it was the only way he
could control time.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.795
He became obsessed.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.464
I suppose some part of
me had been expecting

19:27.467 --> 19:29.533
him to take his own life
these past few years.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.003
I see.
Do you know

19:32.071 --> 19:34.038
of anyone who may have wished him harm?

19:36.775 --> 19:38.676
Strother Campbell.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.213
He's a junior partner at our law firm.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.282
Miles was the one to
recruit him, actually.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.285
He rose very quickly,
but over the past couple of years,

19:48.354 --> 19:51.956
- he became quite antagonistic.
- How so?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.091
He thought Miles should step down.

19:54.093 --> 19:57.228
Strother would be the one to take
over his cases, his standing.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.464
Things got heated at a company
meeting a few weeks ago.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.834
- Strother threatened him.
- What did he say, exactly?

20:03.902 --> 20:06.637
He told Miles if he didn't step down,

20:06.639 --> 20:09.407
Strother would remove
the element of choice.

20:12.178 --> 20:15.746
"The Doctor has directly inspired

20:15.814 --> 20:18.783
"at least two murders,
which bear a striking similarity

20:18.851 --> 20:21.085
to the macabre theory put
forth at his lecture."

20:21.153 --> 20:23.053
It's all just so ridiculous.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.122
There is an old
expression about doctors:

20:25.190 --> 20:27.258
"The sun gives light to their successes,

20:27.326 --> 20:29.293
and the earth hides their failures."

20:29.361 --> 20:31.729
That's a lovely sentiment.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.799
We are fortunate to do what we do.
This too shall pass.

20:34.867 --> 20:38.302
You have made quite a
life for yourself here.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.337
- The city suits you.
- As you said,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.506
I've been very fortunate.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.942
And your Detective Murdoch
seems like a fine fellow.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.911
He is.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.415
At dinner the other night,

20:51.484 --> 20:53.450
- you asked about children.
- I hope I wasn't untoward.

20:53.519 --> 20:56.354
Oh, not at all.
I just wasn't able to elaborate

20:56.422 --> 20:58.356
at that moment.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.500
We've been unable to
conceive up till now,

21:09.568 --> 21:12.803
but I believe I have a solution.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.905
Are you familiar

21:14.907 --> 21:16.907
with Ernest Starling and his recent work

21:16.975 --> 21:18.909
- on pancreatic secretion?
- Somewhat.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.911
Hormones, I believe, was the word

21:20.913 --> 21:24.181
- he proposed for the secretion.
- Yes. Well, I believe

21:24.250 --> 21:26.216
the same principal can be applied

21:26.285 --> 21:28.218
to the reproductive sciences.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.688
If hormones regulate the
activity and the growth

21:30.756 --> 21:32.923
of the pancreas, it stands to reason

21:32.992 --> 21:35.259
that the same principle could
be applied of the ovary.

21:35.261 --> 21:38.129
- Perhaps...
- I've been researching

21:38.197 --> 21:41.231
a treatment that would
boost hormone efficacy.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.834
If all goes well,
I would be the first test subject.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.337
Has the treatment been scrutinized?

21:46.405 --> 21:48.906
There are still more tests
to be done, which is

21:48.974 --> 21:52.076
why I haven't told William.
I want to be sure, first.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.078
Julia.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.280
I wish you nothing but the best.

21:56.282 --> 21:59.149
But if I may provide a
slight guiding principal.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.085
Of course.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.354
Caution over exuberance.

22:03.422 --> 22:06.323
Children are the greatest
gift anyone could receive,

22:06.392 --> 22:08.392
and we should all know
the joys of parenthood.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.728
But you mustn't allow
your scientific judgment

22:10.796 --> 22:12.730
to be clouded by your desire.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.199
The risks must be heeded.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.242
This is the life, lads.
Wind at your back,

22:25.310 --> 22:27.645
comrades at your side,
the authority to arrest

22:27.713 --> 22:29.513
who you please.
Serve and protect,

22:29.581 --> 22:31.382
- that's what I always say.
- Yes, sir.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.251
These are the salad days, son.
Enjoy them while you can.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.720
- Sir.
- You there, you there!

22:36.789 --> 22:39.724
Oi, you there! Stop!

22:42.027 --> 22:45.329
Get him!

22:58.477 --> 23:00.444
Good work, son.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.279
Thank you, sir.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.348
These shoes are too bloody tight,
otherwise I would have

23:04.384 --> 23:06.350
- been right there beside you.
- Sir.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.485
I've never seen such speed!

23:08.488 --> 23:11.422
Where were you, Higgins?
I'm giving you 20 bloody years!

23:11.490 --> 23:14.759
25,
sir.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.960
I have statements

23:16.963 --> 23:19.763
from a number of witnesses,
including his nephew,

23:19.832 --> 23:23.500
that you threatened Mr Borden
days before his murder.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.936
In a fit of anger, my mind
may have trailed my mouth.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.971
But I did not kill the man.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.707
On the contrary,
I admired and respected him.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.544
What was the argument about?

23:33.612 --> 23:36.413
The old man took me under his wing,

23:36.482 --> 23:39.984
and I will be forever grateful.
But his time had passed,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.286
and the work was suffering.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.388
It was merely hubris
that kept him going.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.824
You seem quite certain of that.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.160
I'm a pragmatist, Detective.

23:49.228 --> 23:52.329
The law is about performance
and ability, not emotion.

23:52.397 --> 23:55.266
I brought in more clients than
any other lawyer at that firm.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.334
I should have been the senior partner.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.471
Where were you this morning,
Mr Campbell?

24:00.539 --> 24:02.540
Meeting with a client.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.343
I went directly from home to
his office, then to the firm.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.479
I'll be needing his name and address.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.015
Of course.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.017
But you should be talking
to Miles's nephew, Jack.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.119
- Why do you say that?
- Jack was always complaining

24:16.188 --> 24:18.489
about the pro bono work his
uncle was doing for the firm.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.624
They were constantly arguing about it.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.027
Miles had become somewhat of a...

24:23.095 --> 24:25.295
philanthropist in his later years.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.098
And you believe that gave Jack cause?

24:28.166 --> 24:30.367
I believe Jack

24:30.369 --> 24:32.369
to be unstable, vindictive and greedy.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.171
Interesting.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.574
He said much the same about you.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.511
Sir.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.684
Bloody epidemic, this.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.487
So it would seem.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.388
Why does he look like that?

24:51.390 --> 24:54.525
And why would a man save his own waste?

24:54.527 --> 24:57.027
He was a recluse of some sort.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.000
Sir.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.569
Bloody hell.

25:05.637 --> 25:08.805
Mr Paul Adelaide.
He was found by the woman

25:08.874 --> 25:10.741
who cleans here,

25:10.809 --> 25:12.809
an Eleanor Webster.
She's waiting for us.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.678
A maid?

25:14.746 --> 25:18.115
Had her work cut out
for her, didn't she?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.284
I went through the usual ritual:

25:20.352 --> 25:23.087
knock thrice before entering,
remove shoes on

25:23.155 --> 25:25.689
..not near... the doormat,
hair in a net,

25:25.758 --> 25:27.824
pillowcases on my feet.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.160
I stepped into the living room,
and there he was.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.363
How long had you worked for Mr Adelaide?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.231
Nearly 10 years.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.167
And how would you characterize
your relationship?

25:37.235 --> 25:39.269
He was my employer.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.204
He paid well...

25:41.273 --> 25:43.440
but the man should have been
put in a sanitarium years ago.

25:43.508 --> 25:45.809
I did his cleaning, shopping,

25:45.877 --> 25:47.744
took in his laundry... everything.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.713
I was the wife he paid.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.715
I see.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.717
Did he have enemies?

25:53.785 --> 25:55.986
I should think so;
he could be a right bastard.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.221
But he was ill.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.724
It's a wonder he didn't do it sooner.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.393
Ms Webster...

26:03.462 --> 26:05.596
it wasn't suicide.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.731
Mr Adelaide was murdered.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.935
The result is the same.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.706
When did you last see him alive?

26:15.774 --> 26:17.674
Yesterday.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.543
He screamed at me for leaving streaks

26:19.545 --> 26:22.412
on his dining room table...
a table he never used.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.615
Threatened to withhold

26:24.617 --> 26:26.617
this week's pay,
and then paid me double.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.886
Generous.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.722
Demented.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.690
What kind of person keeps
someone on edge that way?

26:33.759 --> 26:36.693
10 years of that.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.062
He was a sick man, Detective.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.031
He refused help and pushed away

26:41.100 --> 26:43.033
whatever friends and family he did have.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.003
As much as I pitied him,
death should have come sooner.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.208
Looks to me like a sequential
killer choosing victims

26:51.276 --> 26:53.177
- in the autumn of their years.
- That is

26:53.245 --> 26:56.146
- a distinct possibility.
- A possibility?

26:56.214 --> 26:57.748
You still think there's
more than one killer?

26:57.849 --> 26:59.717
Sir, there are differences

26:59.785 --> 27:01.885
between the first and
the other two murders.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.388
What, the bruising as
opposed to the head wound?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.790
I find it difficult to
believe that someone would

27:06.859 --> 27:09.059
kill three men solely based on something

27:09.127 --> 27:11.328
Dr Osler supposedly said.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.497
Stranger things, Murdoch.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.532
Stranger things.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.801
Sirs, the latest edition
of Miss Cherry's column

27:17.869 --> 27:19.770
- has just come out.
- What now?

27:19.838 --> 27:21.772
She accuse Osler himself of the murders?

27:21.840 --> 27:24.675
Well, not quite.
She's published a letter

27:24.677 --> 27:27.678
from somebody calling
himself "The Mercy Killer."

27:27.746 --> 27:29.880
He's taking responsibility
for all three murders.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.349
I'm not one to say I
told you so, Murdoch.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.952
So I won't.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.830
Ah, Miss Cherry.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.367
Come in. Please, have a seat.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.970
I imagine you'll be wanting this,
Detective.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.905
Yes.

27:54.973 --> 27:56.873
Thank you.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.910
Typewritten, no return
address or signature,

27:59.978 --> 28:01.845
plain stationary.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.981
I can see that.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.016
It's quite nondescript.

28:06.084 --> 28:07.985
How did you obtain this?

28:08.053 --> 28:09.987
It came in the day's mail.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.057
Miss Cherry, if you know who...

28:14.126 --> 28:16.293
I have no reason to lie, Detective.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.229
Well, that's not exactly true.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.665
- How so?
- Reveal the killer,

28:21.733 --> 28:23.667
lose your exclusive.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.969
You must think me quite the monster,

28:26.037 --> 28:28.371
to put my career above the
lives of innocent people.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.842
You should have come to us first.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.311
The public's right to know is
equally as important as yours.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.713
Besides, I'm giving it to you now.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.284
Yes, well,
next time.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.586
I meant no harm, Detective.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.322
I was simply doing what I thought

28:45.324 --> 28:47.257
was in the best interest of the public.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.727
As I will continue to do.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.771
"The aged have been a blight on
our society for far too long.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.640
"Until they realize the burden
they place on the young,

29:03.709 --> 29:07.044
- the killings will continue."
- He's baiting us.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.713
The letter sheds no light on

29:09.781 --> 29:11.849
- how he's choosing his victims.
- It's right here

29:11.917 --> 29:13.884
they're old.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.386
Yes, but why these ones?

29:16.454 --> 29:19.323
I don't believe a man who
goes through the trouble

29:19.391 --> 29:22.425
of staging such elaborate murders
would choose his victims at random.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.195
Not everything's a puzzle,
Murdoch. Sometimes people

29:25.197 --> 29:28.398
- are just crackers.
- He has to find them somewhere.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.935
It may be as simple as
following old people home.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.437
But how does he know their schedules?
Or the exact

29:34.440 --> 29:36.439
right time to strike? We've found

29:36.508 --> 29:39.376
no familial, social,
or financial connections.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.412
I have George retracing their
steps over the past few days.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.414
You do that, then. And while

29:44.482 --> 29:47.284
Crabtree pushes paper,
more geezers are at risk.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.231
Hope you're all behaving
yourselves today, gentlemen.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.267
You did well today, son.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.269
I'll get the drinks, sir.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.006
Good lad.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.243
- Sir?
- What?

30:13.245 --> 30:15.045
Would you like to sit?

30:15.113 --> 30:17.848
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yeah, there's a seat right here.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.183
- Why would I need a seat?
- I don't know, I just thought...

30:20.252 --> 30:22.686
Do I look like an invalid to you?

30:22.688 --> 30:24.588
- Uh, sir?
- Why you think I need

30:24.656 --> 30:26.923
to sit down?
I've been walking around all day

30:26.926 --> 30:28.725
and I feel as fit as a fiddle.
Unlike you,

30:28.794 --> 30:30.594
who looks like a stiff
bloody wind'd blow you over.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.397
- I just thought...
- Thought what?

30:33.465 --> 30:35.498
Well, speak up, you dopey-lookin' sod!

30:35.567 --> 30:37.467
Father, we'd best be heading home.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.807
Never get old, son.

30:49.214 --> 30:52.148
- Mr Stanley Bingham.
- His name's familiar.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.652
He was Professor Emeritus of
Biology at the university.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.856
Of course.
He was a colleague of Dr Osler's,

30:58.891 --> 31:00.891
if I'm not mistaken.

31:00.926 --> 31:03.326
Bruising and chloroform is
consistent with the others.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.662
If there's anything else...

31:05.698 --> 31:07.764
We'll let you know.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.670
Sir.

31:13.738 --> 31:16.273
- Find anything?
- Not much I'm afraid,

31:16.341 --> 31:19.443
the professor's wife died years
ago and he has no other family.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.511
No one at the university
had so much as a bad word

31:21.580 --> 31:23.914
to say about him.
But there is something else, sir.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.982
Afternoon edition.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.884
There's another letter.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.120
He claims responsibility,

31:30.188 --> 31:32.289
but doesn't mention Bingham by name.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.257
That doesn't mean he didn't do it.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.160
He may not even know their names.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.063
Sirs, this may be nothing,
but I found laundry receipts

31:40.065 --> 31:42.399
belonging to our latest victim,
Stanley Bingham.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.001
It appears he used the same
service as our last victim,

31:45.004 --> 31:48.104
Paul Adelaide. They both went
to Churchill's Laundry Service.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.340
So they'll both have clean
shirts for their burials.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.342
Is this all we've got?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.344
- Well, also...
- What is it, Crabtree?

31:54.412 --> 31:57.547
There's something about this letter,
the way it's worded.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.750
- What about it?
- Well, the killer

31:59.818 --> 32:02.352
uses the phrase,
"lays down the knife and fork."

32:02.421 --> 32:05.188
It's an antiquated expression for dying.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.358
"Until the last sexagenarian
lays down the knife and fork."

32:08.427 --> 32:10.360
Never heard it before.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.395
- I have.
- Well good for you, Crabtree.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.432
Must be one of your Newfoundland
sayings that I'm unaware of.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.901
Newfoundland,
sir. But no,

32:17.970 --> 32:20.037
I heard it from Miss Cherry.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.909
"Lay down the knife and fork".

32:25.977 --> 32:28.578
That's a fairly specific expression,

32:28.646 --> 32:31.881
- don't you think?
- I suppose so.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.751
Miss Cherry, is there anything
you would like to tell us?

32:34.819 --> 32:36.720
I have no idea.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.789
What are you insinuating?

32:38.857 --> 32:42.459
Have you altered, or tampered
with this letter in any way?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.461
Absolutely not.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.463
Need I remind you that
four men are dead?

32:46.531 --> 32:49.967
If you've had contact with the killer,
you must tell us.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.635
Are you helping him to write these?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.738
Louise, tell us the truth, please.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.673
I've heard you use the phrase before.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.976
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.912
Well, then. Perhaps a night in the cells

33:02.948 --> 33:05.115
will help to refresh your memory.

33:05.183 --> 33:07.985
Wait.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.788
It's me.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.193
I am the Mercy Killer.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.003
Explain yourself, Miss Cherry.

33:26.038 --> 33:29.305
Of course I didn't kill anyone,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.174
but I did write those letters.

33:31.242 --> 33:34.110
- Why would you do that?
- I was simply trying

33:34.179 --> 33:37.581
- to give a voice to the killer.
- But you don't know anything about him!

33:37.649 --> 33:40.650
- Or if it's even one killer.
- I know that whoever he

33:40.718 --> 33:43.787
or they are, they were
putting the aged in danger.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.989
And using Dr Osler's comments as fuel.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.792
Comments that you took out of context.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.162
You are dangerously close to seeing
the inside of a cell, Miss Cherry.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.531
I've committed no crime, Detective.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.466
Impersonating a killer, for a start.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.968
It was merely a performance.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.504
A performance?

34:01.507 --> 34:04.040
I was attempting to fuse
a persona into the story,

34:04.109 --> 34:07.410
as the journalistic essays of
Mark Twain or Daniel Defoe

34:07.479 --> 34:11.014
might have. Giving the killer
an identity, as it were.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.416
You have ruined the reputation

34:13.418 --> 34:16.319
of a great man,
and possibly aided a murderer.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.353
Louise, this goes beyond the pale.

34:18.422 --> 34:20.889
I'm sorry you feel that way.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.993
I'll be telephoning the
senior editor of the Gazette.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.029
At least we'll have the
satisfaction of seeing you fired.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.498
That is your right.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.167
George, take Miss Cherry to the cells.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.103
On what charge?

34:33.170 --> 34:35.371
Obstruction of justice.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.206
Don't touch me.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.087
I still think it's a sequential killer.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.121
Just because Louise Cherry
invented one out of thin air

34:52.123 --> 34:54.123
doesn't mean a real one isn't out there.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.092
But that still leaves
the question of motive.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.128
And I've had a nagging thought,
although it might

34:58.130 --> 35:00.130
- be somewhat unorthodox.
- It's all fair game

35:00.198 --> 35:02.099
- at this point.
- Well, sir, what if it

35:02.134 --> 35:05.401
is a single killer,
but the motive isn't madness?

35:05.404 --> 35:08.004
What if there was only one true target?

35:08.072 --> 35:10.006
And the others were distractions?

35:10.075 --> 35:12.308
Killed to make it look like a pattern.
Misdirection...

35:12.344 --> 35:14.878
- decoys, if you will.
- Well, if that's true,

35:14.946 --> 35:16.880
which one was the intended victim

35:16.948 --> 35:19.249
and which were the decoys?

35:19.317 --> 35:22.485
Henry, you and George gather the alibis

35:22.554 --> 35:24.587
of everyone that may
have had motivation.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.956
Times, dates, locations.
As quickly as possible, please.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.559
Sir.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.395
Right. Strother Campbell?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.197
He was meeting with clients the day

35:34.266 --> 35:36.232
of Paul Adelaide's murder.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.635
Oliver Linehan?

35:38.703 --> 35:40.670
I was able to confirm

35:40.738 --> 35:42.639
his meetings the day of
Norman Doyle's murder.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.875
And he was out of town the day
Stanley Bingham was killed.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.711
It's like tic tac bloody toe.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.913
Eleanor Webster?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.915
She was at the hospital with her son

35:51.917 --> 35:54.317
the day Doyle was killed, and attending

35:54.385 --> 35:56.286
Adelaide's funeral the day
of the Bingham murder, sir.

35:58.189 --> 36:01.024
All right. That only leaves
one person without alibi

36:01.092 --> 36:02.959
for all of the murders.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.994
Well, that's it, then.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.930
He's the one.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.672
Ah. Have you found the killer?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.874
Archie Doyle, you're under arrest

36:17.943 --> 36:20.143
for the murders of Norman Doyle,
Miles Borden, Paul Adelaide

36:20.179 --> 36:23.613
- and Stanley Bingham.
- What?! Are you're joking?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.616
- Come quietly and don't make a scene.
- I didn't kill my father.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.818
- I didn't kill anyone!
- We'll talk about this

36:28.886 --> 36:31.621
- down at the station.
- Stop!

36:31.623 --> 36:35.759
Ma'am, you're welcome to come
down to the Station House, but...

36:35.827 --> 36:37.861
My son didn't murder Norman.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.896
No one did.

36:39.964 --> 36:43.733
- Norman... killed himself.
- What?

36:43.801 --> 36:45.668
I never thought he was capable.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.570
No...

36:47.639 --> 36:49.872
I left that morning
to go and fetch eggs.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.975
He didn't want to get out of bed.

36:52.010 --> 36:55.478
I decided that I would cook
his favorite breakfast.

36:55.546 --> 36:59.049
But when I returned, I found him

36:59.117 --> 37:01.017
..dead.

37:03.188 --> 37:05.188
By his own hand.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.924
That doesn't explain
the blow to his head,

37:07.926 --> 37:10.059
nor the window latch
that was tampered with.

37:10.128 --> 37:13.196
This is a god-fearing home, Inspector.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.565
If the church discovered the
truth about Norman's death,

37:15.633 --> 37:17.333
they never would have allowed us

37:17.402 --> 37:19.335
to be buried in the same cemetery.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.005
I did what I had to

37:22.007 --> 37:23.940
so that we could be together.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.176
I wanted to be with him in
this life and the next.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.679
- Oh, mother.
- Oh, my boy.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.848
Oh, my son.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.083
I'm so sorry.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.085
What now?

37:36.088 --> 37:38.087
All of the other suspects have alibis.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.890
Not quite.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.630
- Mr Borden.
- How did you get in here?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.532
You're coming with us

37:49.600 --> 37:51.367
to the station house.
Suspicion of murder.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.269
That's preposterous!

37:53.272 --> 37:55.371
I told your constable the
same thing I told you.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.374
I wasn't even in town
for the first murder!

37:57.442 --> 38:00.777
- That's what gave you away.
- I don't follow.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.812
Oh, you will.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.781
You had an alibi for the first murder,

38:04.849 --> 38:07.851
that of Norman Doyle,
but none for the others.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.919
I see. And that isn't enough?

38:09.921 --> 38:12.989
Norman Doyle's death wasn't murder.
It was suicide.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.991
You didn't need to be in town.

38:14.993 --> 38:18.094
And this is your proof? Scheduling?

38:18.162 --> 38:20.730
Detective, please,
I'm embarrassed for you.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.833
Save your energy, Mr Borden.
You'll need it.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.668
Why would I kill my own uncle?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.503
Miles wanted to give back later in life.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.739
He'd been emptying the
company's coffers.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.974
You asked him to stop, and he refused.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.011
- Ridiculous.
- Strother Campbell didn't think so.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.746
Oh, you mean the man who
threatened to kill Uncle Miles?

38:36.814 --> 38:38.748
He's lying,
obviously.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.850
Be that as it may,
you're coming with us.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.185
Unbelievable.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.756
Get your hat and coat, Mr Borden.
The clocks are ticking.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.558
Fine.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.527
If only to put this silliness to rest.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.831
Completely absurd!

38:54.833 --> 38:57.834
When this is all over,
you can expect to have a costly lawsuit

38:57.836 --> 39:00.437
- on your hands.
- Fine, just fine.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.572
This is how you conduct
an investigation?

39:02.640 --> 39:04.574
Just waltz into a dead man's home

39:04.642 --> 39:06.576
and accuse his grieving
relative of murder?

39:06.644 --> 39:10.113
- Sir, where are we going?
- Not long now, Murdoch.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.849
Why are we going in this direction?

39:12.917 --> 39:14.784
Isn't the station the other way?

39:14.853 --> 39:17.120
Do you recognize the area?

39:17.188 --> 39:19.656
I... have a client who lives near here.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.691
Oh, really?
What's his name?

39:21.693 --> 39:25.061
Jonathan Mac...
Madder... horn.

39:25.129 --> 39:27.063
That's a bit of a mouthful,
isn't it? Do you mind

39:27.065 --> 39:29.165
if we stop,
Mr Borden?

39:29.233 --> 39:32.202
I could do with a minute's rest.
Not as young as I used to be.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.339
Actually, do you mind if
I pop in to the laundry?

39:36.408 --> 39:38.375
Need to pick some shirts up.
The wife couldn't make it today.

39:38.410 --> 39:42.211
- Sir?
- Do you ever use them, Mr Borden?

39:42.214 --> 39:44.180
They do excellent work.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.883
- Stop!
- I've got this one, Murdoch.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.960
It's over, son.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.429
- Give it up.
- Do you have any idea

39:59.497 --> 40:01.698
how expensive it is to
maintain a law firm?

40:01.766 --> 40:04.968
We need to be billing all
the time just to stay alive.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.570
Miles didn't care.
He would have ruined us!

40:07.572 --> 40:10.707
- That's why you murdered him.
- I have good years left!

40:10.775 --> 40:12.742
Just 'cause his clock was running out,

40:12.810 --> 40:14.711
he needs to destroy things
for the rest of us?

40:14.779 --> 40:17.079
So you killed him, and two

40:17.148 --> 40:19.048
- other innocent men as decoys.
- They were useless.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.485
Yes, I killed them.
God help me, I killed them all.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.922
- You'll hang for this, Borden.
- Not if I can get through you.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.126
- Come on, then.
- Fine. What's one more

40:30.128 --> 40:34.063
dead old bastard?

40:36.334 --> 40:39.869
Well done, sir.
But I'm curious, how did you

40:39.937 --> 40:42.205
- know about the launderers?
- Intuition.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.607
It was the only connection.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.709
Stood to reason that's
how he found them.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.278
I knew he'd give himself away.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.914
The one thing you learn
with age, Borden,

40:51.983 --> 40:54.784
is never wait for the
other fella to square off.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.754
There's no such thing in
life as a fair fight.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.012
I'm sorry all this

41:23.080 --> 41:24.847
has happened, Miss Cherry.
I'm not sure you deserved it,

41:24.883 --> 41:26.849
even though...

41:26.918 --> 41:28.785
what you did was rather dreadful.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.120
In any case, you're free to go.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.322
Thank you,

41:33.325 --> 41:35.325
I suppose.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.493
What will you do?

41:37.562 --> 41:39.562
I suppose you could

41:39.630 --> 41:41.531
find work as a typist.

41:41.599 --> 41:44.334
I have a friend Sam
who works in a bank...

41:44.402 --> 41:46.369
That won't be necessary.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.337
I appreciate your interest,
but it is both

41:48.340 --> 41:50.640
misplaced and ill-timed.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.376
Excuse me?

41:53.444 --> 41:55.411
I've been hired by another paper.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.480
You're joking.

41:57.482 --> 41:59.482
I received a visit

41:59.484 --> 42:01.784
from the editor of the Telegraph
less than an hour ago.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.686
His offer was quite generous:

42:03.754 --> 42:05.655
title and wages

42:05.723 --> 42:07.657
significantly more substantial
than at the Gazette.

42:07.725 --> 42:11.060
Congratulations.

42:11.128 --> 42:13.429
What's more, your opportunity

42:13.431 --> 42:15.431
to comment on my affairs has passed.

42:15.499 --> 42:18.601
You made your choice, George Crabtree.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.970
Now, if you'll excuse me,

42:21.039 --> 42:23.039
I need a quote from Detective Murdoch.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.116
And you must come and
visit us in England.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.984
- Oh!
- What's all this about England?

42:34.986 --> 42:36.986
Dr Osler has been offered

42:37.054 --> 42:39.055
the Professorship of Medicine at Oxford,

42:39.123 --> 42:42.058
by King Edward himself,
so he's moving there.

42:42.126 --> 42:44.727
But not before I finish
my speaking tour.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.263
That's quite the schedule
for a man of your years.

42:47.331 --> 42:49.765
There's no fixed period
for usefulness, Inspector.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.435
The trick is to accept the
cycles of age as they come

42:52.503 --> 42:56.238
- and to enjoy them.
That's all I've ever promoted.
- Sound advice.

42:56.307 --> 42:59.408
Inspector.
Julia,

42:59.477 --> 43:01.544
do take care.
And please,

43:01.612 --> 43:05.081
send word when you know.
Strength and faith.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.683
It was so wonderful to see you again.

43:07.752 --> 43:11.420
Thank you for your diligent work,
Detective.

43:11.423 --> 43:13.222
As trying as these past
few days have been,

43:13.291 --> 43:15.091
I was grateful to have you on my side.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.060
The pleasure was all mine.

43:18.963 --> 43:21.764
Oh, and I'll be happy to have
a rest from these for a while.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.937
Well done, sir.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.906
There's plenty of life
left in me yet, Murdoch,

43:29.974 --> 43:32.342
so don't be getting any ideas.

43:37.114 --> 43:39.048
Shall we?
