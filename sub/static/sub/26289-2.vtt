WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.552
I've always believed
that it is better

00:18.586 --> 00:20.654
to ask for forgiveness
than for permission.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.623
(singing high tone)

00:26.060 --> 00:27.795
Forgive me.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.532
Sentinel Services.
On the ground!

00:31.565 --> 00:33.667
-What's happening?
-Girls, run! Get out!

00:33.701 --> 00:35.369
CRISTINA:
Did you find my sister?

00:35.403 --> 00:37.171
-Her name is Jazmine.
-I'll ask, okay?

00:37.205 --> 00:40.541
Baby, what are you doing
in our little girl's name?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.743
-I quit.
-The mutant hacker.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.613
-I want to talk to him.
-Hey! (shouts)

00:45.646 --> 00:47.715
-Give us what we came for.
-Knock yourselves out.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.717
It's Caitlin.
She was grazed by a bullet.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.819
(grunting)

00:53.087 --> 00:55.689
My name is Evangeline.
We need people like you.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.924
You think you're the only one

00:56.957 --> 00:59.059
with demons inside you,
Ms. Dane?

00:59.093 --> 01:01.229
(screaming)

01:02.463 --> 01:04.031
Whole grid went silent.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.300
(grunts)
No.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.802
Hello, Dawn.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.571
(bell clangs)

01:10.604 --> 01:12.706
(crowd cheering)

01:12.740 --> 01:14.242
(grunting)

01:30.624 --> 01:31.592
Come on!

01:31.625 --> 01:32.626
(cheering)

01:32.660 --> 01:34.628
(panting)

01:34.662 --> 01:36.297
MAN:
Kill that mutie!

01:39.767 --> 01:40.801
*

01:40.834 --> 01:42.803
(grunting)

01:48.476 --> 01:49.677
Yeah!

01:49.710 --> 01:51.645
Come on!

01:55.283 --> 01:57.285
(country music playing
over radio)

02:03.056 --> 02:04.592
EVANGELINE:
If I didn't know any better,

02:04.625 --> 02:05.993
I'd say you were
holding back in there.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.961
A crowd likes a good show.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.363
Tell me something.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.800
Is this really
who you want to be?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.368
(chuckles)

02:14.402 --> 02:16.704
What can I say, lady?
I'm living the dream.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.106
Look, I would love to sit here
and chat with you, but I got

02:19.139 --> 02:22.543
another fight in ten
and, uh, I got to hydrate.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.011
Then I'll be brief.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.449
My name is Evangeline Whedon.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.484
I worked with the X-Men
before they disappeared.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.952
I need your help.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.321
Do I look like I'm in any shape
to help anyone?

02:33.354 --> 02:35.956
I'm an attorney,
not a therapist.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.858
I'm not here to give you a hug.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.361
I'm here to give you a chance
to stop wasting your life.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.363
-You don't know anything
about my life.
-I know you grew up

02:42.396 --> 02:44.398
on a reservation too poor
to pave its roads.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.999
I know you served two tours
in the Marines

02:46.033 --> 02:47.635
with decorations for bravery,

02:47.668 --> 02:49.537
and got kicked out after 7/15.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.173
All my life,
I wanted to be a lawyer.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.008
And I worked my ass off.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.212
I became the youngest prosecutor
in Philadelphia history.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.616
And then my mutant powers
came out.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.661
Turns out, the D.A. had
an issue with mutants.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.563
I lost everything.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.998
I was close to ending it
when the X-Men found me.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
So you're here to give me
a reason to live?

03:20.067 --> 03:21.769
Our Underground station
in Atlanta.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.404
We want you to help lead it.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.005
What?

03:25.038 --> 03:28.676
Look at me. Why?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.544
(people cheering, whistling)

03:30.578 --> 03:32.413
Because a face like yours
deserves better

03:32.446 --> 03:33.614
than a baseball bat.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.449
You weren't chosen by accident.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.419
You were chosen because we know
who you're capable of being.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.088
I'm offering you
a purpose again, John.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.769
(knocking on door)

03:58.238 --> 03:59.707
Am I interrupting?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.275
No, you're fine.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.583
What's that?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.719
Just something for the baby.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.822
I know it sounds insane,

04:14.855 --> 04:17.725
but I never gave up hope
that we'd somehow be together

04:17.758 --> 04:19.993
when Lorna had the baby.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.663
I even bought that bottle
of champagne to celebrate.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.099
I ordered the same kind
on our first date.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.901
Cost more than the meal.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.404
And Lorna just laughed at me.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.239
She said,
"Marcos, there's nothing

04:32.272 --> 04:34.475
worth spending 200 bucks
on booze for."

04:34.508 --> 04:35.809
(laughs softly)

04:35.843 --> 04:39.146
I was gonna prove her wrong.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.952
Hey. Hope is a strong thing,
brother.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.354
You hang onto that.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.689
Hope is what's been
killing me, man.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.593
I don't even know
if they made it out.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.961
Come on, of course they made it.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.164
How can you be
sure of that, huh?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.500
I mean, all we've got
is a bunch of bank records

04:59.533 --> 05:01.168
from four different continents.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.936
The Inner Circle
is up to something.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.839
And my kid and Lorna are gonna
be right in the middle of it.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.509
It's right there...

05:08.542 --> 05:11.278
and I can't even see it.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
(sighs)

05:17.017 --> 05:19.720
I might know someone who can.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.632
Reeva.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.734
Girls.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.169
-You wanted to talk?
-Yes.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.971
It seems our recent activities

05:38.005 --> 05:41.375
are getting more attention
than we'd hoped.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.378
It's not just the news,
it's all over social media.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.480
#LightsOutDC.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.083
Uh, our engineers assured us
the facility would be able

05:50.117 --> 05:51.585
to contain Polaris's powers
during the birth.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.921
Look, it is
no one's fault, Esme.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.322
We all did the best
that we could.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.357
She was just stronger
than any of us realized.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.093
(screaming)

06:01.729 --> 06:05.032
And I reached out to some
of my political contacts.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.167
The Department of Energy
is gonna put out a statement

06:07.200 --> 06:10.070
about a lightning strike
at a substation, but...

06:10.103 --> 06:13.807
we still need to tie up
the other loose ends.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.177
ESME:
Well, is that really necessary?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.779
The guards won't remember us.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.081
Our names don't matter.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.217
And we paid off the manager.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.087
The question is whether
you give it to us...

06:27.120 --> 06:28.388
or we take it.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.024
I think they'll keep quiet.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.862
You have so much more faith
in humans than I do.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.265
Everyone who saw us has to go.
The facility, too.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.133
I don't need to remind you
that the future

06:40.167 --> 06:42.202
of the mutant homeland
is at stake here.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.403
PHOEBE:
Don't mind Esme.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.972
She spent too much time
in the Mutant Underground

06:45.005 --> 06:46.640
while we were locked up.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.742
She went a little soft.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.445
I'm just saying we have
other priorities right now.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.813
We're supposed to be training...

06:52.846 --> 06:54.648
Training can wait
until we know we're secure.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.818
Can you handle this for me?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.924
Of course.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.099
Cheer up, Esme. It'll be fun.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.437
BLINK: Hey, Cristina.
We have good news.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.240
-Is it about my sister?
-Yeah.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.243
A source said that a girl
matching Jazmine's description

07:23.276 --> 07:25.245
turned up in a church shelter
in Alexandria.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.181
Oh, my God. That-That's amazing.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.817
They're closed for the night,
but Clarice and I

07:29.850 --> 07:31.451
are heading up in the morning
to pick her up.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.521
-I want to go.
-That's a bad idea.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.255
You're a fugitive.
You need to keep your head down.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.757
What if something happens?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.192
I'm her family.
I should be there.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.194
Look, I can help...

07:42.362 --> 07:45.065
Help, what, smash their lamps?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.168
LAUREN:
We can't do that here, Cristina.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
-We're hiding.
-CRISTINA: I'm sorry.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.874
I just, I can't risk
losing Jazmine again.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.709
She's the only family
I have left.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.277
I know how that feels.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.112
I haven't seen my brother
in six months.

07:59.146 --> 08:03.483
All my life, he's there,
and then one day he's just gone.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.820
Six months? Wow.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.256
Come on, you guys.
Let's call it a night.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.804
LAUREN (echoing):
Andy.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
ANDY:
What are you doing here?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.374
You need to come back.

08:31.579 --> 08:34.481
No. Andy, don't.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.416
-We can't do this again.
-You're wrong, Lauren.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.852
We're meant to be together.
Fenris is our destiny.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.253
No.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.724
Andy. We'll kill everybody.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.925
Andy, no.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.961
No, Andy!

08:51.632 --> 08:54.267
(gasping)
Let go. Let go!

08:59.439 --> 09:00.808
No!

09:06.814 --> 09:09.382
Lauren!

09:09.416 --> 09:11.484
(panting)

09:12.886 --> 09:14.888
(gasps, panting)

09:31.004 --> 09:33.006
(alarm chirps)

09:40.614 --> 09:42.716
(door opens, closes)

09:42.750 --> 09:44.284
Hey.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.920
How was your day?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.889
Nine hours of depositions

09:48.922 --> 09:50.658
-on a zoning law case.
-Fun.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.159
-How was yours?
-Uh, it was good.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.095
It was... you know, it was good.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.164
I got some samosas in here.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.999
I know you like
the potato ones, right?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.301
I love the potato one.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.837
(exhales)

10:03.871 --> 10:06.239
-Didn't you have
a meeting today?
-Uh, yeah.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.241
Yeah, I think I landed
a new client for the firm.

10:08.275 --> 10:12.112
Defense contractor, wants to use
some private security guys.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.115
Baby. That's great.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.450
Yeah.
(laughs softly)

10:17.484 --> 10:19.653
Yeah, yeah.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.489
Hey.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.092
What's going on?

10:25.125 --> 10:29.262
I-I've been thinking about
the blackouts that hit D.C.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.764
-Mm. What about 'em?
-I don't know,

10:30.798 --> 10:32.432
I just got a feeling about it,
you know?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.034
Like I used to get
when I was on the job.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.239
No.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.376
-No, no...
-What?

10:43.410 --> 10:46.446
Don't do this.
You've been doing so well.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.615
-For the last
three months, you...
-Paula, this is different.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.617
This-- it had to be mutants.
There's no other explanation.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.820
Jace, I am begging you:

10:52.853 --> 10:54.454
do not open the door again.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.957
This... this obsession.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.126
You heard what
the therapist said.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.294
-You have to move on.
-I'm just, I'm asking questions.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.163
I'm fine.
I've m-- I've moved on.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.033
Oh, that's why you keep all your
files on the Mutant Underground

11:06.066 --> 11:09.369
in the attic behind
the Christmas lights?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.405
Baby, we have a new life.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.908
We can build a new family.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.345
Please...

11:18.378 --> 11:21.414
promise me that you will focus

11:21.448 --> 11:24.684
on what's really important.

11:24.718 --> 11:29.222
Baby, I'm-I'm good.
I promise.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.007
EVANGELINE:
Our Underground station
in Atlanta,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.109
we want you to help lead it.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.188
How long have you been up?

12:01.221 --> 12:04.091
I'm just thinking.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.258
It's okay.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.761
-Go back to sleep, all right?
-(chuckles)

12:07.795 --> 12:10.163
Is it about that lawyer person
you're gonna go see?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.534
Her name's Evangeline.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.138
And you think that she can help
you track down the Inner Circle?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.707
-Mm.
-So, why does it look like

12:20.740 --> 12:23.010
you're working on
a gnarly heart attack?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.814
She and I have a...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.816
complicated relationship,
I guess.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.788
How complicated are we talking?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.289
Clarice, it's not like that.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.625
-It's not.
-(chuckles)

12:42.863 --> 12:45.565
When I was discharged
from the Marines,

12:45.598 --> 12:48.068
I was really lost,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.737
and I was taking a lot of pills

12:50.770 --> 12:54.074
to deal with the pain, so...

12:54.107 --> 12:57.811
I had no idea.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.779
(groaning)

12:59.813 --> 13:02.149
I'm dying here!

13:02.182 --> 13:04.351
You're killing me.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.153
You're doing this
for a reason, John.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.621
-Focus on that.
-(straining)

13:08.655 --> 13:11.791
Focus on the cause.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.994
That was the worst time
in my life.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.497
But she got me through it.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.771
Well, if she did it once,
she can do it again. Right?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.840
If she even talks to me
after Atlanta.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.019
Bulk, you in position?

13:39.052 --> 13:40.320
BULK (on phone):
Ready and waiting.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.989
Fade, you're a go.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.256
FADE (on phone):
Yes, ma'am.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.298
All right, Bulk.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.066
-Now.
-You got it.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.003
Fire in the hole.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.211
Two down, one to go.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.589
You really think a road trip
to Philly

14:16.623 --> 14:18.258
is a good idea right now?

14:18.291 --> 14:21.494
If there is half a chance
this lawyer can find Andy,

14:21.528 --> 14:22.662
then, yes.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.265
You still have
an open gunshot wound.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.500
(sighs)

14:27.534 --> 14:29.937
Cait, for months I have tried
to give you space.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.941
I mean, I-I know that people
process grief differently.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.408
Our son is not dead, Reed.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.876
You're right.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.411
I think he's very much alive.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.614
But like Lauren said,
he chose to leave.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.150
We should just let him go?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.721
What would you do
if it was Lauren?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.757
What is that supposed to mean?

14:50.790 --> 14:52.225
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.893
What if it was
daddy's little girl?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.363
Fine, you want to talk
about Lauren?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.431
-Let's talk about Lauren!
-(furniture clatters)

14:58.465 --> 15:00.733
We are lucky she is so strong,
because having to handle

15:00.767 --> 15:02.970
living with a mom who is here
in name only...

15:03.003 --> 15:05.372
I mean, I love you
more than anything, Cait.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.575
But since Andy left,
it's like living with a ghost.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.378
I'm a ghost?
What about you?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.980
Disappearing into your work,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.382
lapsing into these
pained silences?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.885
Look, I get it.
Suppress and repress.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.320
It's the Strucker way.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.055
But I was raised a fighter.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.456
I'm just asking you
not to go to Philadelphia.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.624
For the family!

15:24.657 --> 15:26.293
For the...

15:26.326 --> 15:27.827
Okay.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.297
(gasps)

15:34.601 --> 15:37.204
The family is why
I have to go, Reed.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.111
(door shuts)

15:48.515 --> 15:51.084
You.
What are you doing here?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.153
Just checking in
on you, Mr. Hine.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.622
Buying a plane.
How discreet.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.991
What part of "keep your mouth
shut" didn't you understand?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.859
No, I-I-I was just looking.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.694
I-I'm gonna hold on to the money
for six months,

16:01.728 --> 16:02.962
li-like you told me.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.031
Are you sure about that?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.432
Think hard, Mr. Hine.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.267
And remember,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.003
lying to telepaths is
a bad idea.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.405
(engine powering up)

16:14.474 --> 16:18.278
No, I swear on my mother's grave

16:18.311 --> 16:20.447
I-I'm not gonna say a word
to anybody.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.216
That's good,
but we need to be sure.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.059
Why don't you take a walk,
Mr. Hine?

16:32.092 --> 16:35.528
I'd like to walk.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.511
(Sophie and Phoebe groan)

16:51.544 --> 16:53.380
Oh, come on, you're no fun.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.249
That's what you get
for calling me soft.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.550
(groans)

16:59.719 --> 17:01.921
(yawns)

17:01.954 --> 17:05.858
Ugh, you should really rethink
that career as a barista.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.894
I thought looking exhausted
was my job.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.501
I didn't sleep much.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.569
LAUREN:
Andy!

17:16.603 --> 17:18.605
I stayed up playing
League of Legends.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.039
You sure you're okay to train?

17:20.073 --> 17:21.541
Reeva takes this stuff
pretty seriously.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.543
No, I'm cool.
I-I'll be fine.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.426
Andrew, these walls are made
of the same materials

17:39.459 --> 17:41.761
you'll face at the target
of our first operation,

17:41.794 --> 17:43.596
each stronger than the last.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.997
I need you to break
through them.

17:45.932 --> 17:46.899
(beeps)

17:46.933 --> 17:49.269
(three loud beeps)

17:53.440 --> 17:54.441
(grunts)

18:03.983 --> 18:05.852
(yells)

18:07.587 --> 18:10.990
LAUREN:
Andy, no, don't!

18:11.023 --> 18:12.159
(grunts)

18:13.360 --> 18:15.262
(beeping rapidly)

18:15.295 --> 18:17.330
What happened?

18:17.364 --> 18:19.599
Force distribution
just nosedived.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.234
It's never happened before.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.870
(groans)

18:26.606 --> 18:30.777
Get me Fade.
I have an assignment for him.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.485
Did you take
too many shots to the head

18:38.518 --> 18:39.952
in that bar in Tucson?

18:39.986 --> 18:41.921
If Sentinel Services
ever made a connection

18:41.954 --> 18:43.856
between my firm
and the Mutant Underground...

18:43.890 --> 18:45.158
Trust me,
we wouldn't have come here

18:45.192 --> 18:46.493
if it wasn't important.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.494
You shouldn't have come at all.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.861
I can't have fugitives here.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.297
Especially not fugitives

18:50.330 --> 18:52.265
who are supposed to be dead.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.134
Lady, we are out there
fighting every day,

18:55.168 --> 18:56.603
losing people
while you hide in here

18:56.636 --> 18:58.371
like the freakin' Lizard of Oz!

18:58.405 --> 19:01.374
Please, help us.
A-Anything you can do.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.142
I'm a mutant rights lawyer.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.844
Unless you want
to file an injunction...

19:04.877 --> 19:06.279
Look, some of your past cases

19:06.313 --> 19:08.481
involve tracing
bank records, right?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.783
We had a bad run-in
with a mutant group.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.186
It's some offshoot
of the Hellfire Club.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.787
We were able to get
some information on 'em,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.289
but we can't make
heads or tails of it.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.890
They're called the Inner Circle.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.228
-They took my son.
-Wait. Did you say
the Inner Circle?

19:21.261 --> 19:23.796
-How did you get this?
-A friend acquired it for us.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.432
And he's still alive?

19:34.441 --> 19:36.042
Andrew.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.810
Have a seat. I assume you know

19:37.844 --> 19:40.213
-why I asked you to come by.
-Is it 'cause I sucked
at training?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.914
It is curious.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.149
With your abilities,

19:43.182 --> 19:44.684
you should have handled
that barrier easily.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.819
A problem like that
during our operation

19:46.853 --> 19:49.856
-could be disastrous.
-I think I just had an off day.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.392
An off day.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.398
(sighs)

19:59.866 --> 20:01.868
I didn't have a lot
of friends growing up.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.404
My only friend was
a girl named Benazir.

20:04.437 --> 20:08.074
We protected each other.
I loved her.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.543
One day, though, we had a fight.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.445
I was so angry.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.581
And then, later that day,
we were attacked

20:14.614 --> 20:16.249
by a gang of Purifiers.

20:16.283 --> 20:20.219
My feelings about the fight,
everything just got in the way,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.389
and my powers wouldn't come.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.291
So what happened?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.296
They stabbed her.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.265
She died in the street.

20:32.299 --> 20:35.868
All I could do was sob
while she bled out.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.272
That was my "off day."

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
That was a day, Andrew,

20:40.973 --> 20:43.543
that I learned that our powers
tell the truth,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.412
even when we don't.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.414
So...

20:47.447 --> 20:49.716
you have anything
you want to tell me?

20:49.749 --> 20:52.485
No.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.889
I won't fail again
this afternoon.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.291
I promise.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.994
I'm glad to hear it.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.148
THUNDERBIRD:
Did you have any luck

21:22.181 --> 21:23.483
looking at your
father's research?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.485
Not much. He just gave me
his old notebooks.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.693
OTTO:
September 22, 1985.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.329
Reed had another attack
of neuralgia.

21:36.363 --> 21:39.932
They seem to be triggered by
elevated glucocorticoid levels.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.469
(groaning)

21:42.502 --> 21:43.836
I fear if...

21:43.870 --> 21:46.105
REED: "I fear if I don't
do something soon..."

21:46.138 --> 21:47.607
Dad?

21:47.640 --> 21:50.109
Hey, honey.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.713
Clarice and I are heading out
to pick up Jazmine.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.214
Okay, great.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.551
-What are you doing?
-I was just looking at some

21:58.585 --> 22:00.620
old family stuff.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.391
Even got some photos
from your old Instagram account.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.797
-Stalker.
-(chuckles)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.965
That was the night
that Andy bet me

22:12.999 --> 22:14.367
he could eat a whole cheesecake.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.369
-A bet he won, if I recall.
-Mm.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.805
He might've won the bet,
but he definitely lost.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.239
He was puking all night.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.814
Dad. Are you okay?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.482
Yeah, of course.

22:29.516 --> 22:33.152
You know it's okay
not to be okay.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.854
Right?

22:38.891 --> 22:41.561
You don't have
to worry about me.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.468
Hey.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.738
I'll see you at the clinic.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.585
(Polaris humming)

23:07.887 --> 23:09.456
(knock on door)

23:16.663 --> 23:18.765
I'm not bugging you, am I?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.767
No. I could use the company.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.402
Dawn's a sweetheart,
but not much of a talker yet.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.472
I guess you heard
about training.

23:25.505 --> 23:29.108
Yeah. Andy, what happened?

23:31.010 --> 23:32.979
(sighs) I don't know.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.783
I've been having, like,
thoughts, I guess.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.152
What kind of thoughts?

23:40.186 --> 23:43.155
At first it felt like
I was just missing my family.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.157
Now it feels like
something different.

23:45.191 --> 23:48.394
It feels like
I should be with Lauren.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.764
Look, a little homesickness
is fine,

23:51.798 --> 23:53.933
but you are being trusted,

23:53.966 --> 23:57.003
and if Reeva gets the idea
that you're not with her 100%...

23:59.038 --> 24:00.573
That cannot happen.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.843
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.178
Yeah, I just need to get
my head back in training.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.914
That's all.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.850
(cries)

24:10.883 --> 24:13.820
Oh, what is it with you?
I just tried feeding you.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.855
Make up your mind.

24:15.888 --> 24:19.291
Sorry, Andy, she has to eat.

24:19.325 --> 24:22.695
Oh, you mean like that.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.533
See you later.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.969
(door opens)

24:36.543 --> 24:39.546
(sighs)

25:07.173 --> 25:09.809
(line ringing)

25:09.842 --> 25:11.644
WOMAN (over phone):
Community of Mercy Clinic.

25:11.678 --> 25:16.382
Um... hi. I-I-I'm not sure
if this is the right number,

25:16.415 --> 25:18.985
but I'm-I'm calling
to talk to Lauren.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.387
-Lauren?
-Is-is she there?

25:21.420 --> 25:25.825
I'm sorry.
Um, one moment, please.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.594
REED (over phone):
Hello?

25:32.031 --> 25:34.701
Hello?

25:34.734 --> 25:36.903
Who is calling, please?

25:36.936 --> 25:40.539
I can hear you.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.812
How do you know Lauren?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.619
No.

26:04.230 --> 26:08.000
It's me. We got a problem.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.805
(indistinct chatter)

26:19.445 --> 26:21.580
JACE:
Hey.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.583
Hey, buddy.
Janine, two more.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.818
Thanks for meeting with me, man.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.419
Of course.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.321
Lot of folks around Sentinel
Services thought you got

26:29.355 --> 26:32.391
a raw deal on that
Mutant Underground business.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.893
Thank you.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.327
Thanks.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.730
Yeah, well, it's kind of why
I called you.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.232
I just wanted to pick your brain
about the blackout that hit D.C.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.902
Word is, some kind of electrical
storm hit a substation.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.004
Glitch in the system
knocked out the whole grid.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.107
-And you believe that?
-Yeah.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.310
Come on, man.
I read all the news reports.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.779
Eight transformers exploded.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.346
There were surges through
the grid for half an hour.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.748
That's not normal.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.117
We had a mutant in custody
a while back named Lorna Dane.

26:58.150 --> 27:02.254
Turner, everybody knows
how much you and Paula lost,

27:02.288 --> 27:03.656
but this is crazy.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.592
Listen to me, as your friend.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.994
Let it go.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.764
New job, new place.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.933
You and Paula pulled through.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.501
You want to blow all that

27:15.534 --> 27:18.470
for the sake
of some conspiracy theory?

27:18.504 --> 27:21.473
'Cause that's
where you're headed.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.811
(scoffs)

27:25.845 --> 27:28.647
(sighs)
Sorry I'm late.

27:28.681 --> 27:32.284
I had a brief to file.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.520
Hey.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.056
Figured it was time
to clear out the attic.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.393
-Are you sure?
-You know, for the longest time,

27:41.427 --> 27:43.195
I thought that
if I stopped, I'd be,

27:43.229 --> 27:44.663
I don't know, letting her down.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.568
The truth is, there's not enough
justice in the world for Grace,

27:49.601 --> 27:51.037
and if I don't let go
of the past,

27:51.070 --> 27:52.671
I'm gonna lose my future, too.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.342
You didn't just lose
your daughter on 7/15.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.777
You lost your husband, too.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.547
I see that now.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.717
You will...

28:04.751 --> 28:09.688
never know how much it means
to hear you say that.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.997
Thank you. Let me know
if you find anything else.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.432
My associate managed to trace

28:20.466 --> 28:22.334
some of the Inner Circle's
transactions.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.904
There are weapons purchases,
facilities,

28:24.937 --> 28:28.340
assets diversified and hidden
in every way imaginable.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.842
She's preparing for war.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.778
She who?
One of the Frost sisters?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.846
Not them.
Not alone, anyway.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.748
Any of you ever heard
the name Reeva Payge?

28:37.049 --> 28:39.418
No. Never.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.519
She's one of the most
powerful mutants

28:40.552 --> 28:41.921
still standing after 7/15.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.456
There were rumors she'd
taken over the Inner Circle.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.858
Seems they're true.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.293
So help us stop her.

28:47.326 --> 28:51.697
Stop her?
With their resources?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.199
Not to mention,
she now has Polaris

28:53.232 --> 28:54.934
and a descendant
of the Von Struckers.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.769
We don't have
that kind of power.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.405
There are other powerful mutants
that are with the Underground

28:59.438 --> 29:01.307
in New York, in Chicago, L.A.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.476
So I should bring them here so
you can lead them into battle?

29:04.510 --> 29:05.744
(sighs)

29:05.778 --> 29:07.213
Since your failure in Atlanta,

29:07.246 --> 29:10.449
half the Underground's
been taken apart.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.384
Sentinel Services
has cracked down on mutants

29:12.418 --> 29:13.786
and anybody who helps them.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.154
You think I'm gonna
let you destroy

29:15.187 --> 29:16.923
the rest of what we built?

29:19.959 --> 29:24.063
Look, I... I told you
what you wanted to know.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.998
Now get out of my office.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.337
-Look, what she said about...
-Don't.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.605
Atlanta was not your fault.
We were all there.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.141
It was my responsibility.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.508
ECLIPSE: No, it was
on all of us, brother.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.810
You did everything you could.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.378
CAITLIN:
We'll find another way.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.514
You guys go on ahead.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.617
I'll meet you at the car.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.826
(Andy sighs)

29:53.860 --> 29:57.329
Hey, they're ready
for you downstairs. You good?

29:57.363 --> 30:00.199
Yeah.

30:00.232 --> 30:04.170
(three loud beeps)

30:04.203 --> 30:05.204
(grunts)

30:06.705 --> 30:09.108
Kinetic energy is back
to its original level.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.843
Moment of inertia is climbing.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.447
-He's doing it.
-He hasn't done it yet.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.317
LAUREN:
Andy, don't! Don't!

30:18.350 --> 30:20.019
No!

30:27.659 --> 30:29.395
Well?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.830
What's his problem?

30:31.864 --> 30:33.599
It's the sister.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.180
I thought I told you to leave.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.682
Yeah, I didn't come
all the way here to give up.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.851
We can't win, John.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.987
Sorry I was harsh,
but it's the truth.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.323
Look, when you found me
in Tucson,

30:57.356 --> 30:59.558
you told me I needed a cause.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.094
I got people dying out there,

31:02.128 --> 31:04.430
and they need something
to believe in right now,

31:04.463 --> 31:07.066
especially after Atlanta.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.834
Evangeline, you got
to give me something.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.602
I can't tear apart
the Mutant Underground for this.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.138
There aren't enough of us left.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.877
But...

31:18.911 --> 31:20.546
But what?

31:20.579 --> 31:25.051
There is a mutant.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.019
Goes by Erg.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.620
He's a mutant separatist.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.222
He lives in the tunnels
under D.C.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.291
Nothing happens in town
he doesn't know about.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.960
And he'll help?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.561
He might.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.299
Thank you.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.069
Don't thank me.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.471
Giving you hope is the worst
possible thing I could do.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.873
Reeva is ruthless.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.741
Your friends
are never coming home.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.610
She'll kill them first.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.112
And if they stay with her,

31:53.145 --> 31:55.948
chances are
you'll have to kill them.

31:55.982 --> 31:57.616
I'm sorry for that night
in Tucson.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.051
I gave you a cause.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.420
I didn't know that cause
was doomed.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.001
Girls, in here we speak
with our mouths.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.669
-Sorry, Reeva.
-We were just trying
to let you think.

32:17.703 --> 32:21.173
So, what are you gonna do
about Andy?

32:21.207 --> 32:24.243
What would you have me do

32:24.276 --> 32:25.744
if he's making calls
to the Underground,

32:25.777 --> 32:27.746
if he's told 'em where we were?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.648
Fade said he made one call
and hung up.

32:29.681 --> 32:30.949
You saw what happened in there.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.985
He didn't even make a dent
in the boron carbide.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.920
If he can't get through that,
then this operation fails

32:34.953 --> 32:38.257
and our dream dies.
(sighs)

32:38.290 --> 32:40.526
Perhaps his family connection
is stronger than we realized.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.761
His family is why he's here.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.830
He's a Von Strucker.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.365
You know what that could
mean for us.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.467
I know what it means
if he's on our side.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.801
But if he doesn't trust us...

32:49.835 --> 32:52.204
PHOEBE:
Then we can't trust him.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.672
REEVA:
I'll talk to him.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.208
Assess the situation,
whether he's reliable.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.444
-What-- and if he isn't?
-Well, we can't keep him here

32:58.477 --> 33:01.047
if he's not ours, and we
certainly can't let him go.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.350
-He's 15.
-Do you think I enjoy this?

33:04.383 --> 33:07.486
We have a problem.
It needs to be solved.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.860
REEVA:
Must be tough.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.396
Being without family
for so long.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.331
I must admit,

33:19.365 --> 33:22.868
I hoped that you'd come to think
of this place as a home.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.503
Of us as people you could trust.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.004
I do.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.174
Do you know what I saw
in that training room?

33:28.207 --> 33:31.009
Someone whose mind
was elsewhere.

33:31.043 --> 33:34.213
I saw a young man with doubts.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.182
With secrets.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.650
I-I just need practice.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.819
It's perfectly fine
to have doubts, Andrew,

33:40.852 --> 33:44.756
but... to lie about them?

33:48.094 --> 33:50.696
There's nothing.

33:50.729 --> 33:54.100
-I'm not lying about anything.
-I see.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.869
(inhales)

33:59.905 --> 34:02.141
I'm glad we sorted this out.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.746
(inhales sharply)

34:10.949 --> 34:12.918
(exhales)

34:12.951 --> 34:15.287
Actually, there is something.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.189
But it's bad.

34:17.223 --> 34:20.025
Yes?

34:20.058 --> 34:23.462
My mom knows
I play League online.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.232
For the past six months,
she's been messaging me,

34:26.265 --> 34:28.200
telling me where they are
and how to find them.

34:28.234 --> 34:31.403
-But I never responded.
-Until today.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.440
I called Lauren.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.108
I just wanted to hear her voice.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.110
But she wasn't there.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.878
So I hung up, and that's it.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.080
And why now?

34:44.583 --> 34:49.255
I've... I've been having dreams,

34:49.288 --> 34:50.822
where she's afraid of me.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.324
And I tried to forget it,
but I...

34:52.358 --> 34:54.126
Andrew, I don't want you
to forget it.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.263
I want you to use it.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.498
We're here to build a homeland.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.433
For all of us,
including your sister.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.670
But in order to do that,
you have to be strong.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.538
Can you do that?

35:10.309 --> 35:11.977
Yes.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.521
Memphis is humid, all right?

35:22.554 --> 35:24.323
So you're gonna need
to change this twice a day.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.962
-CC!
-Jazmine. Oh, my God.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.132
I thought I'd never
see you again.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.134
JAZMINE:
I missed you so much.

35:36.168 --> 35:38.770
Hey, Clarice,
could you possibly

35:38.804 --> 35:41.373
help these guys get loaded up?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.942
Yeah. No sweat.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.477
You guys have a long drive
ahead of you.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.145
We should get going.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.348
You two take care of each other.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.716
BLINK:
Let's go, guys.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.154
-(door closes)
-Can't be easy.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.789
What?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.359
Seeing siblings get
back together like that.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.494
Lauren, if there is
something wrong,

36:02.528 --> 36:04.996
-you can just tell me about it.
-Honestly, I'm-I'm fine.

36:05.030 --> 36:07.633
You know,
when I was a prosecutor,

36:07.666 --> 36:09.635
we learned
that any sentence that began

36:09.668 --> 36:12.438
with the word "honestly"
usually wasn't true.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.876
Are you seriously gonna try
to talk to me about the truth?

36:17.909 --> 36:21.813
You and Mom always arguing
and fighting about finding Andy,

36:21.847 --> 36:23.882
but pretending
everything is okay?

36:23.915 --> 36:26.352
Do you think
about what that means?

36:26.385 --> 36:28.420
Don't you want him to come back?

36:28.454 --> 36:30.322
Of course I do.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.324
But, Dad,

36:32.358 --> 36:36.428
back in Atlanta,
we killed 15 people.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.531
I've been looking them up.
I know their names.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.166
I know their kids' names.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.369
But you and Mom have never once
talked about that day.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.871
Or what it might mean for me
to have Andy come home.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.573
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

36:47.606 --> 36:48.640
So am I.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.545
Every day.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.886
(door closes)

37:00.919 --> 37:02.888
No.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.656
(grunting)

37:10.762 --> 37:12.598
(grunting)

37:22.641 --> 37:24.743
(panting)

37:30.115 --> 37:31.450
(sighs)

37:31.483 --> 37:33.585
-Hey, babe.
-I can't believe I used to think

37:33.619 --> 37:35.321
wearing heels were
a pain in the ass.

37:35.354 --> 37:38.457
Passing as non-mutant
is definitely the worst.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.760
Anyway, how did things go
with Evangeline?

37:41.793 --> 37:44.162
It was good.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.231
Yeah, it was good.
We made some progress.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.734
Got the name of somebody
who might help.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.603
Wait, I thought she was
the person that might help.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.772
She did, she did.
This guy that she pointed us to,

37:53.805 --> 37:55.907
he has eyes everywhere

37:55.941 --> 37:58.977
and might be able to tell us
about the Inner Circle.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.813
So it's good.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.082
So, success.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.486
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's great.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.521
(laughs softly)

38:12.891 --> 38:14.893
John, is there something wrong?

38:16.562 --> 38:18.196
Did something happen
with Evangeline?

38:18.229 --> 38:21.800
Hey, it's fine, I promise.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.201
Everything's okay.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.705
Good.

38:26.738 --> 38:29.207
I was worried she chained you
to another bed.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.443
Wow, that's funny.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.044
(both laugh)

38:35.481 --> 38:40.318
God, you are so beautiful.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.521
Shut up.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.858
Go on.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.575
(door opens)

39:03.609 --> 39:05.210
What are you doing out here?

39:05.243 --> 39:07.045
Uh...
(chuckles)

39:07.078 --> 39:09.881
Reed and Lauren are still
at the clinic.

39:12.283 --> 39:14.986
There a party
I wasn't invited to?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.756
-Yeah.
-Mm.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.592
Yeah, it is a big celebration.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.696
You know, I was gonna do this
with Lorna, but, um...

39:24.730 --> 39:28.266
(chuckles)

39:28.299 --> 39:31.136
...to the baby.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.044
-(chuckles)
-(exhales)

39:41.913 --> 39:43.549
To the baby.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.923
Mmm.
God, that's good.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.092
-(laughs)
-Expensive.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.429
I can't remember the last time
I tasted champagne.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.631
You know...

39:59.665 --> 40:02.868
I can't stop thinking
about what Evangeline said.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.736
About a war coming?

40:04.770 --> 40:07.906
If we don't find them in time,

40:07.939 --> 40:09.107
Caitlin,
I don't know if I can...

40:09.140 --> 40:10.375
Don't.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.745
Don't you dare
give into despair.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.147
It'll eat you alive.

40:34.533 --> 40:39.137

40:43.008 --> 40:47.846

40:47.879 --> 40:52.283

you're not the one *

41:25.651 --> 41:29.387

41:29.420 --> 41:34.359

don't want no more *

41:36.327 --> 41:40.699

you want to, want to go back *

41:41.900 --> 41:46.371

41:47.606 --> 41:53.178

42:13.932 --> 42:16.702
Well, look at that.

42:16.735 --> 42:20.038
* Memories come

42:21.640 --> 42:24.876

Look, Dawn.

43:12.157 --> 43:15.460
Daddy's saying hi.

43:15.493 --> 43:17.295
Wake up, Dawny.

43:17.328 --> 43:20.966
Dawn? You're burning up.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.738
Oh... Okay. Okay.

43:26.772 --> 43:28.139
It's okay.

43:28.173 --> 43:30.976
Help! Somebody, please!

43:31.009 --> 43:33.044
I need help!

It's time to pick a side

44:15.186 --> 44:17.322
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:19.557 --> 44:20.759
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:23.094 --> 44:25.463
