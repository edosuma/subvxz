Once Upon a Christmas

In a beautiful palace

00:40.704 --> 00:46.848
Was reunited with his Queen

01:05.536 --> 01:11.680
Away a place where dreams

01:53.920 --> 01:58.272
That was a princess

02:08.000 --> 02:11.072
Your calling

02:11.328 --> 02:11.840

02:15.168 --> 02:17.728
You know seriously she takes these mother-daughter outing

02:19.520 --> 02:21.824

03:05.088 --> 03:07.648
You don't have a tiny apartment anymore why do we need tiny tree

03:08.160 --> 03:10.208
I know but it's so cute

03:10.720 --> 03:12.256
No one else buys it

03:12.768 --> 03:13.280
How about that

03:13.792 --> 03:16.096
I'll take this to the office and you pick out one for the house

03:16.864 --> 03:18.912
And remember the one you pick out you have 2K

03:19.168 --> 03:21.216

04:05.504 --> 04:08.064
Well I hope everybody made memory ornaments

04:12.672 --> 04:15.232
Taylor Swift doesn't have any special ornament

04:15.744 --> 04:17.536
Bell just gold and silver

04:18.047 --> 04:18.815
The song

04:19.839 --> 04:20.351
And again

04:20.607 --> 04:22.399

American Best

06:16.063 --> 06:16.575

06:17.599 --> 06:20.415
The ski resort they want to build will create hundreds of jobs in

06:20.927 --> 06:22.463
Bring money to restore a little country

06:23.231 --> 06:23.999

Steve instructed this dr. Dre the Queen's private chamber

07:30.303 --> 07:31.839
We are securing her jewels in the vault

07:32.607 --> 07:34.911
But I wondered if perhaps there was something

07:35.423 --> 07:36.959
You like to keep for yourself

07:39.263 --> 07:45.151
It was my mother's

07:45.407 --> 07:45.919
I know

09:05.791 --> 09:09.631
My name is Marcus and I'm the manager here at the luxury Seaside Hotel

09:10.399 --> 09:11.167
Welcome your highness

09:16.287 --> 09:18.847
Are you sure you want to stay here

09:19.359 --> 09:23.967
I made a backup reservation

09:24.223 --> 09:27.295
Our potential business

09:28.063 --> 09:31.647
The other hotel is much more secluded

09:32.415 --> 09:34.975
Have you really been to Los Angeles if you don't stay at the beach

09:35.487 --> 09:36.511
Everybody's happy

09:37.279 --> 09:37.791
Marcus

09:38.047 --> 09:38.815
Breaded chicken

09:40.863 --> 09:42.655
You will have to keep

09:42.911 --> 09:44.703
Especially close tabs from here

09:46.239 --> 09:49.823
Season Scott this so-called manager to be more discreet

09:50.079 --> 09:56.223

10:24.127 --> 10:28.991
Going up on the floor plan for two but they were designed for 3

10:30.271 --> 10:36.415
Builders are getting feedback people don't like it so they want to do another option but I can just move it to a regular microwave

10:36.927 --> 10:37.439
I get it

10:38.207 --> 10:41.023

You guys are you coming

10:56.127 --> 11:01.247
So much fun

11:02.527 --> 11:08.671
Home maybe they have a father-daughter go to the lodge for hot chocolate chip

11:15.327 --> 11:21.471
I'm so sorry I was trying to get them

11:22.495 --> 11:28.639
I mean everybody else we don't have a dad to bring on the ski trip and never even met mine

11:28.895 --> 11:29.663
Name

11:30.431 --> 11:32.479
Your mom still won't talk about it

11:32.991 --> 11:36.575
No I mean to make her sad so I stopped asking

11:37.343 --> 11:43.487
At least you don't have Katie's dad

11:43.743 --> 11:49.887
He's always on his phone threatening to fire someone into office

11:50.143 --> 11:56.287
Lorena

11:56.543 --> 11:57.567
Your highness

12:00.127 --> 12:03.967
Rose's not setup a secure Wi-Fi network for my computer yet

I can get you any information

12:08.319 --> 12:09.087

12:09.599 --> 12:12.415
That's why I attended University in Los Angeles many years ago

12:13.439 --> 12:15.231
We should take this long reflective Drive

12:15.743 --> 12:16.767

It was okay

12:45.439 --> 12:46.463
Holidays are hard for her

12:47.231 --> 12:49.535
Cherryfield the absence of a father that much more

12:50.303 --> 12:52.607

13:47.135 --> 13:49.439
What's up by one of those executive matchmaking companies

13:49.951 --> 13:50.975
I hate these horrible day

13:52.767 --> 13:55.327
It would be a lot more tolerable if you would just join me

13:56.351 --> 13:58.143
I'm not going with you

13:58.911 --> 13:59.679
No thanks

14:00.959 --> 14:02.751
Not looking for anything serious right now

14:03.519 --> 14:05.311
Have you ever look for anything serious

16:57.599 --> 16:59.647
I'm in Los Angeles meeting with investors

17:01.439 --> 17:02.463
It's just a business

17:03.487 --> 17:04.511
Because you're a prince

17:06.815 --> 17:08.607
Technically I am the king now

17:11.423 --> 17:12.446

17:12.959 --> 17:14.494
You didn't tell me but I knew

Apologize Allison

17:48.287 --> 17:49.055
Being able to tell you

17:50.079 --> 17:56.223
I wanted to plan to but the timing it's never seemed right and my

17:56.479 --> 18:01.599
My parents they only allowed me to attend University in America if I promise to keep my identity a secret

18:03.903 --> 18:05.439
They saw this

18:05.695 --> 18:06.975
Matter of National Security

18:10.047 --> 18:11.327

18:45.119 --> 18:46.399
I do still prefer tea

18:55.871 --> 18:57.151
But then I always knew you would

19:01.503 --> 19:03.295
As you should be

19:05.855 --> 19:09.439
Must confess

19:09.951 --> 19:11.231
I did look you up

19:11.743 --> 19:13.535
I see that you have a child

19:16.351 --> 19:17.119
How do you say that

19:17.375 --> 19:19.935
I don't want to seem like a real stalker

19:21.215 --> 19:21.983
I thought of you

19:22.239 --> 19:23.007
Many times

19:23.775 --> 19:25.567
I have resources at my disposal

19:26.847 --> 19:28.127
I don't believe you

19:29.151 --> 19:31.455
I was here you would make a good mother even back then

19:32.735 --> 19:35.295
Are you kidding me

19:35.551 --> 19:36.319
Compliment me

19:38.879 --> 19:41.439
I should be upset

19:42.207 --> 19:46.559

19:48.095 --> 19:48.863
Spell

19:49.375 --> 19:49.887
The note

19:53.215 --> 19:56.031
I wrote you letters and you never reply

19:57.823 --> 19:59.103
I never got any letters

20:38.527 --> 20:44.671
Call the Ambassador will be fired on the spot local

20:44.927 --> 20:51.071
Create a scandal

21:01.567 --> 21:07.455
Plans for today

21:07.711 --> 21:08.479
Take a try

21:09.759 --> 21:15.903
If you don't wanna try

21:20.000 --> 21:23.328
But he said it on like that she was in my container

21:36.896 --> 21:38.944
Can I have my lip gloss back

21:39.200 --> 21:44.832
How much of my makeup have you borrowed

22:19.648 --> 22:23.232

22:34.496 --> 22:35.264

Wish you a metal hours

23:59.488 --> 24:00.512
And already

24:00.768 --> 24:01.536
Running off

24:01.792 --> 24:04.608
Like a reckless teenager to see that woman

24:04.864 --> 24:05.376
Her name is Alice

24:06.656 --> 24:07.424
She was very important

24:07.680 --> 24:08.704
One point in my life

24:09.728 --> 24:11.264
It's only natural that would want to reconnect

24:13.824 --> 24:14.592
We discussed

24:14.848 --> 24:15.872
Distraction

24:16.896 --> 24:19.712
It is not for this visit was about

24:21.760 --> 24:24.064
Never did get all the lettuce I sent it back then

24:26.112 --> 24:27.136
How's that possible

24:31.488 --> 24:34.560
I think it's time to leave well enough alone

24:36.352 --> 24:38.144
Tracking her down

24:38.400 --> 24:40.192
A couple of years ago

24:40.704 --> 24:42.496
Satisfies your curiosity

24:43.264 --> 24:46.592
She just moved on Charles she has a child

24:47.360 --> 24:49.152
Mew2king

24:50.944 --> 24:52.736
Propriety

24:54.272 --> 24:56.320
Network my entire life is

24:58.880 --> 25:02.720
Great privilege

25:02.976 --> 25:06.304
Brings great responsibility

25:13.728 --> 25:19.104
I have a huge headache I'm going to go upstairs take a nap

25:19.360 --> 25:21.152
Okay

25:52.896 --> 25:54.432
It was the craziest thing

25:54.688 --> 26:00.832
This fancy looking guy walked out of my mom's office and then this big black SUV with tinted windows I mean like you couldn't see in it

26:02.880 --> 26:06.208
Comes out and he drives off in another car like a

26:06.464 --> 26:09.536
Super fancy sports car

26:09.792 --> 26:13.888
And they just drive off together

26:14.144 --> 26:16.448
Is your mom designing a house for a celebrity

26:22.336 --> 26:23.872
Guys are definitely his bodyguard

26:32.064 --> 26:34.112
My mom is definitely acting weird

26:34.624 --> 26:40.768
She's always been super secretive about dating she acts like she isn't

26:41.024 --> 26:47.168
Protecting me from something

26:47.424 --> 26:50.496
How do you know

26:50.752 --> 26:53.312
Doesn't this look like the same flag from your picture

26:54.080 --> 26:55.360
I think so

26:56.384 --> 27:00.480
Taenia

27:07.392 --> 27:09.440
Kahoot

27:09.696 --> 27:12.000
This is the guy who's outside my mom's office

27:13.024 --> 27:14.560
King

27:14.816 --> 27:15.584
Taylor

27:16.096 --> 27:20.960
Do you remember last year when we were snooping around my mom's closet trying to find my birthday present

27:21.216 --> 27:24.032
We found that box of old stuff that my mom kept from college

27:24.544 --> 27:26.848
There was one of her with some guy

27:27.360 --> 27:33.504
Your mom knows a king

29:22.816 --> 29:25.888
What

29:35.104 --> 29:41.248
When and where baby

30:25.792 --> 30:30.144
That's right there's a little European nation Miss Elizabeth

30:30.400 --> 30:31.424
That sounds almost

30:32.704 --> 30:33.984
Call for Tanya

Good night

33:24.480 --> 33:24.992

Amazing college

So good to see you good to see you

33:59.552 --> 34:01.344
But then I said if you got it my friend

34:02.880 --> 34:04.416
What have you been doing these days

34:06.976 --> 34:10.304
Human the back in school when I told you I was expected to go into the family business

34:20.543 --> 34:21.824
Have you been

34:24.639 --> 34:25.408
We need to talk

34:28.224 --> 34:33.344
Ali's father's Not Dead

34:35.136 --> 34:36.416
Remember the Christmas party

34:37.184 --> 34:38.208
Junior in college

34:38.719 --> 34:41.792
Someone bumped into me and I fell

34:42.047 --> 34:43.328
He was dressed and

34:43.583 --> 34:46.143
And he asked me what my Christmas wish was

34:46.400 --> 34:50.239
And then you asked her if she cared about your Christmas which was

34:50.496 --> 34:51.775
Because it was my wish

34:52.032 --> 34:52.800
To go out

34:54.848 --> 34:55.871
He asked me to dance

34:56.896 --> 34:59.200
And the next thing I knew she was my boyfriend

34:59.968 --> 35:03.552
He wasn't really my type of guy the rich European but

35:03.808 --> 35:05.344
We are really happy together

35:05.600 --> 35:08.416
Everything is Charlie was great

35:10.464 --> 35:11.744
I really loved him and

35:12.000 --> 35:13.024
She really love me

35:13.280 --> 35:14.560
I thought we'd be together forever

35:15.072 --> 35:21.216
It was the anniversary of the night we met at that party

35:21.472 --> 35:24.032
The anniversary of our first kiss

35:24.288 --> 35:30.432
A fresh dance for everything

35:30.688 --> 35:36.320
And that was a night that Lily was conceived

35:36.576 --> 35:42.720
Baptist

35:47.072 --> 35:49.632
Then 2 Days Later

35:49.888 --> 35:51.424
We parted ways for winter break

35:51.936 --> 35:55.520
I went home and I told Rosa

35:56.032 --> 35:58.848
Crazy hot to KIPP college dorm rooms

35:59.104 --> 36:00.384
Well she wasn't actually my heart

36:02.688 --> 36:03.456
Myopia

36:05.248 --> 36:10.112
What is that like a royal babysitter

36:11.904 --> 36:13.952
I told Rosa that I was in love

36:14.976 --> 36:20.352
That I wanted to say in America after graduation a week later after I get home from winter break

36:20.864 --> 36:21.632
Despair

36:21.888 --> 36:22.400
Bussy

36:22.656 --> 36:24.704
Copper lady shows at my house with an accent

36:24.960 --> 36:26.496
What you tell me that Charlie

36:26.752 --> 36:27.520
Was the prince

36:28.032 --> 36:30.080
He was at Addison throwing up while tinea

36:30.592 --> 36:32.128
And I can never be at the counter

36:32.384 --> 36:32.896
Rude

36:33.408 --> 36:34.944
She told me that he was engaged

36:35.456 --> 36:36.224
Google time

36:36.480 --> 36:39.040
Duchess

36:39.808 --> 36:41.344
Your life is a soap opera

36:42.112 --> 36:44.160
Need a few weeks later

36:44.672 --> 36:45.440
I got this

36:49.280 --> 36:51.328
Did Charlie

36:52.096 --> 36:53.888
He lied to me and never want to see you again

36:56.448 --> 36:58.240
And then

36:58.496 --> 37:00.288
She made me write a breakup letter

37:00.800 --> 37:02.080
What do you mean she made you

37:02.336 --> 37:03.104
She insisted

37:03.616 --> 37:04.896
She will think about it

37:07.456 --> 37:09.248
I want to see him anyway

37:09.760 --> 37:11.040
I was heartbroken

37:11.552 --> 37:13.344
I wrote Alice in 2 months

37:14.112 --> 37:15.136
She never replied

37:16.928 --> 37:22.816
After the winter break my parents informed me that I would not be returning to University that they had arranged the prophet marriage poem

37:23.584 --> 37:25.376
Tell me

37:27.168 --> 37:29.216
Cat very much

37:32.288 --> 37:38.176
I was always thinking about what I had lost

37:38.432 --> 37:42.272
A few weeks later

37:46.112 --> 37:50.208
On the cover of a tablet Charles engaged to a duchess

37:50.720 --> 37:52.512
And after all these years

37:52.768 --> 37:55.328
Why can't you telling the truth

37:55.840 --> 37:57.120
What could come of that

37:57.632 --> 37:58.400
You're the liar

38:03.264 --> 38:07.616
But I still understand it on the palace made it clear that I wouldn't be welcome there

38:09.920 --> 38:11.712
Father

38:13.248 --> 38:14.272
If he had known

38:14.528 --> 38:15.808
Maybe he would have wanted her

38:16.832 --> 38:19.136
Charlatan being spotlight

38:19.648 --> 38:21.952
All the pressures of being a royal

38:25.024 --> 38:26.560
If you use back Astros

38:26.816 --> 38:28.096
Give me some information on house

38:38.848 --> 38:40.640
To the hotel you have to talk to him

38:42.432 --> 38:47.040

38:47.808 --> 38:50.112
He traveled thousands of miles to come see you

38:51.136 --> 38:52.672

39:09.312 --> 39:14.432

Calm down

39:46.176 --> 39:47.712
Let's figure something out

40:28.160 --> 40:29.696
We were really overthinking this

40:30.464 --> 40:36.608
Definitely I have to see how I must explain what happened

40:36.864 --> 40:40.448
Does bodyguard ever let you leave

40:41.472 --> 40:46.592

The team is going to be hosting a party later

41:52.895 --> 41:54.943
Why we can crash

41:57.503 --> 42:03.647

42:03.903 --> 42:04.671
So

42:05.183 --> 42:08.255

Great to see you

52:47.231 --> 52:47.999
Wait so

52:49.023 --> 52:49.791
Your Sam

52:51.327 --> 52:52.351
Emma

52:59.263 --> 53:01.311
Okay

53:01.567 --> 53:07.711
Hi so I can assume that you didn't buy any land recently

53:08.479 --> 53:09.503
No

53:10.015 --> 53:10.527
I did

53:11.551 --> 53:12.063
I want

53:13.087 --> 53:15.135
Every something up in the hands

53:15.903 --> 53:16.671
Schodack

53:17.439 --> 53:18.463
Your nice dick

53:19.999 --> 53:22.303
Allison

53:22.559 --> 53:23.327
I know that you

53:23.839 --> 53:27.167
Discovered my true identity when we're at University together

53:30.495 --> 53:31.775
I know I hurt you

53:33.311 --> 53:34.591
Simply

53:34.847 --> 53:38.175
Would like to apologize in a relationship

53:38.431 --> 53:39.455
But you have a child

53:39.967 --> 53:41.759
I would not want to interfere with you

53:48.159 --> 53:50.207
Needed to see that

53:50.463 --> 53:52.511
You had moved on with your life

53:54.559 --> 53:55.839
I still thought about you

54:06.335 --> 54:12.479
What's your name honey

54:12.735 --> 54:14.783
I think of a place where we can go

54:15.039 --> 54:21.183
Just in case we off the same copyleft up front for a quick getaway

54:21.439 --> 54:23.999
What is it to me

54:24.255 --> 54:26.303
I mean I was homecoming queen

54:27.839 --> 54:29.119
Fear of death

54:31.167 --> 54:33.215
Watch TV or something you know

54:33.471 --> 54:37.823
Get your mind off things and then you can talk to your mom okay okay fine

54:39.103 --> 54:45.247
When we told you last week to keep your

54:45.503 --> 54:48.063
Eyes peeled for royalty

54:48.575 --> 54:51.647
King Charles of betania said he was in town on state business

54:51.903 --> 54:53.951
It looks like things got a bit

54:54.207 --> 54:55.487
Personal

54:56.511 --> 54:59.071
Who is the Mystery Lady

55:02.655 --> 55:06.495
I don't know who she is but for her sake let's hope the glass slipper fits

55:07.007 --> 55:13.151
Let me get this straight you haven't heard from him in 17 years

55:13.663 --> 55:15.711
Because you out of the blue

55:15.967 --> 55:17.247
Vintage music King

55:18.271 --> 55:19.039
Is a cane

55:19.551 --> 55:20.575
10 days later

55:20.831 --> 55:22.879
You're like crashing the party to help him

55:25.439 --> 55:29.535
I bet you do you're really serious friend

55:30.047 --> 55:33.887
Oh you're really serious romantic

55:36.959 --> 55:38.751
And speaking of romance

55:39.519 --> 55:41.567
Always been curious about that

55:52.831 --> 55:56.159
Even she dropped it or they were Russian officer bribes

55:56.671 --> 55:57.439
Also

56:03.839 --> 56:04.863
Taking my car

56:05.887 --> 56:10.495
Cadillac

56:10.751 --> 56:11.519
No

56:12.543 --> 56:14.335
I could always give you a ride

56:20.991 --> 56:22.527
Can I

56:22.783 --> 56:24.063
Take you out for dinner

56:28.159 --> 56:32.767
You Can Let Go

56:33.791 --> 56:38.399
Thank you

56:41.727 --> 56:44.287
Real-life Cinderella

56:46.847 --> 56:50.431
What's your name

56:50.687 --> 56:56.831
My mom said if I don't bring the car back I'm grounded

56:57.087 --> 57:03.231
I'll call you later

57:21.663 --> 57:22.687
I designed this place

57:23.455 --> 57:24.735
Even I did

57:25.503 --> 57:26.783
Is the first model of 5

57:27.295 --> 57:28.831
Which development of 60 houses

57:29.855 --> 57:31.903
I always knew you'd be a great success

57:35.231 --> 57:38.559
If you ever decide to buy that land

57:39.327 --> 57:40.607
Here's your secluded with a view

57:43.935 --> 57:45.983
Honestly

57:47.007 --> 57:48.287
Just occurred to me tonight

57:49.567 --> 57:50.335
It's not about where you're at

57:58.783 --> 58:04.671
This is the most fun I've had in a long time

58:07.487 --> 58:10.303
This is the best first accidental baby I've ever been

58:15.679 --> 58:17.215
On the 2nd

58:18.751 --> 58:24.639
I hope so

58:39.999 --> 58:41.791
If you promise me that

58:43.327 --> 58:44.607
I'll let you take me on right now

58:53.823 --> 58:55.103
Okay

58:56.639 --> 58:57.919
In this time

59:07.903 --> 59:11.231
Open making up for 17 years of lost time

59:18.399 --> 59:23.775
Now that we have a moment could we play something else

59:26.847 --> 59:28.383
No I've never been married

59:28.895 --> 59:29.663
Unlike you

59:30.687 --> 59:33.247
It's not everyday you see something like that in the 21st century

59:33.759 --> 59:35.551
Maybe the 21st century

59:35.807 --> 59:39.647
My family has been observing the same customs in the 12th century

59:40.415 --> 59:41.183
So you

59:43.487 --> 59:46.559
I marry someone else

59:48.863 --> 59:50.143
I saw it in a tablet

59:50.655 --> 59:51.167
Tablets

59:56.799 --> 59:58.079
Is absolutely untrue

59:59.871 --> 01:00:03.455
All I thought about was our future together

01:00:09.087 --> 01:00:11.391
Erin Smith

01:00:12.415 --> 01:00:13.439
Family

01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:18.303
My parents informed me of the arrangement after you broke up

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:21.887
Try to live a different kind of life

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:23.935
That was a typo

01:00:25.215 --> 01:00:26.239
My parents disappointed

01:00:27.775 --> 01:00:29.311
So I decided to accept my real face

01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:32.127
Arranged marriage is not uncommon

01:00:34.943 --> 01:00:37.247
The cast for my wife

01:00:40.319 --> 01:00:41.343
After I felt love

01:00:44.671 --> 01:00:45.951
I felt that connection

01:00:47.487 --> 01:00:49.023
Play I didn't break up with you

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:50.815
You broke up with me

01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:53.631
I didn't

01:00:58.751 --> 01:00:59.519
Will say something

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:01.311
No

01:01:06.687 --> 01:01:08.991
She told me who you really were

01:01:15.647 --> 01:01:16.671
Is that not true

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:18.719
Honestly

01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:26.655
Rosa made that decision for me

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:30.495
She was really the only mother figure

01:01:30.751 --> 01:01:31.519
I have a new

01:01:33.055 --> 01:01:34.591
I was lucky to see my parents once a week

01:01:35.103 --> 01:01:35.615
Growing up

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:38.943
She thought she was looking out for my best interest

01:01:42.527 --> 01:01:43.807
That that is an excuse

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:45.855
For the way she manipulated

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:47.647
Deceived both of us

01:01:53.023 --> 01:01:53.791
I lied to you

01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:56.351
I felt I had to

01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:58.399
Still not an excuse

01:01:59.679 --> 01:02:00.447
It was betrayal

01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:02.495
And I'm deeply sorry

01:02:05.567 --> 01:02:08.895
To find my way back to you

01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:10.687
You still cancel

01:02:14.527 --> 01:02:15.807
There's something I have to tell you

01:02:17.087 --> 01:02:18.111
I'm not married

01:02:22.975 --> 01:02:23.743
That is wonderful

01:02:25.535 --> 01:02:26.303
Her name is Lily

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:28.607
She 17

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:32.959
Seems

01:02:33.727 --> 01:02:35.519
He moved on yourself

01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:37.567
No I didn't

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:42.175
That night before you left to go home

01:02:58.815 --> 01:03:00.863
I don't know what to say

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:08.799
But does she have a beautiful big eyes and your smile

01:03:09.311 --> 01:03:10.591
Do you know that

01:03:12.639 --> 01:03:14.943
The young lady came by the hotel earlier today

01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:16.735
She said she was doing a survey

01:03:17.247 --> 01:03:18.271
Oceanside University

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:22.111
She asked me about my college girlfriend

01:03:27.743 --> 01:03:31.839
I can't believe I'm straight

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:36.191
Angie's Pizza

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:43.103
You must be so proud

01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:50.783
I understand why you didn't tell me

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:57.439
I'm sorry I didn't fight for us

01:03:57.695 --> 01:04:03.839
Me too

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:06.815
You lied to me

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.863
I know everything

01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:10.399
My dad

01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:13.471
You lied to me for my entire life

01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:16.543
I thought I was protecting you

01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:23.199
You can't tell me what to do anymore

01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:31.903
Lily

01:05:32.159 --> 01:05:38.303
Here

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:40.351
I hope you believe that

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:41.375
If I'd known

01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:42.143
I know

01:05:44.703 --> 01:05:45.983
I realize that I am strength

01:05:47.007 --> 01:05:48.543
I do hope that we can become acquainted

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.615
I want to know everything I missed

01:05:52.127 --> 01:05:52.639
Everything

01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:56.223
Kind of a latte

01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:58.015
Don't even know where to start

01:05:58.527 --> 01:06:00.063
Facebook

01:06:01.855 --> 01:06:03.135
No I have a better idea

01:06:03.903 --> 01:06:04.671
The tree

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:11.839
Every year mom and I make a memory ornament

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:19.263
Lily's first Christmas ornament

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:20.799
Lompoc

01:06:21.055 --> 01:06:24.639
The best thing that happen each year and she made an ornament for it

01:06:25.663 --> 01:06:28.223
This one as when she first went on a walk

01:06:33.087 --> 01:06:34.367
What about this one

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:36.927
Beer I lost my first tooth

01:06:37.439 --> 01:06:39.231
And this one

01:06:39.999 --> 01:06:42.559
Something to do with cooking

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.519
Well I'm sure it was a very

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:53.311
Cuddly and comforting

01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:55.871
Metal whisk

01:06:58.943 --> 01:07:00.479
That's when she was 6

01:07:00.735 --> 01:07:03.295
She had this princess themed birthday party

01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:05.343
Address for

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:07.903
How to wash it while she was sleeping

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:13.535
I feel as

01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:16.095
If I'm witnessing your childhood through these ornaments

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:19.167
Sing all the years that I missed

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:23.775
Mom

01:07:24.287 --> 01:07:27.615
Tinker might have to make another memory ornament for this year

01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:31.711
I don't think

01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:35.039
But I'm still proud of you

01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:39.135
Have you thought about University

01:07:42.719 --> 01:07:45.535
Oxford is only a short flight from botania

01:07:57.567 --> 01:08:01.919
You do not clear on your responsibilities

01:08:02.687 --> 01:08:06.015
You supposed to keep she's highly safe and any other sites

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:08.575
Ambassador

01:08:09.855 --> 01:08:10.879
It's him

01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:14.975
Your highness

01:08:16.511 --> 01:08:18.046
I was hoping you could do me a favor

01:08:18.559 --> 01:08:20.863
Is a duffel bag in the top drawer of my dresser

01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:23.167
Can you find a way to bring it to me

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.447
Discreetly

01:08:25.215 --> 01:08:27.263
The Ambassador does not need to know

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:28.799
Of course

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:29.823
Lahaina

01:08:30.846 --> 01:08:32.127
Where are you

01:08:36.991 --> 01:08:37.759
You do this every year

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.063
Fake hundreds of cookies for your client

01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:42.111
Yeah it's a personal touch

01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:43.390
Any plans for the night

01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:45.951
And Lily results me

01:08:46.719 --> 01:08:47.487
I'm sorry I missed it

01:08:47.743 --> 01:08:49.023
It's a wonderful family tradition

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:50.559
Hey

01:08:57.983 --> 01:08:59.263
I believe that would be for me

01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:09.759
Arena

01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:10.527
Thank you

01:09:10.783 --> 01:09:11.551
Would you like to come in

01:09:11.807 --> 01:09:12.575
She would

01:09:33.055 --> 01:09:39.198
Allison if you don't mind I think

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:41.247
Beneficial if I made some introductions

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.087
How do I

01:09:46.622 --> 01:09:48.415
I'm sure you remember Alison Rosen

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:50.975
She informed me that you choose met

01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:54.559
And this is Lily

Confident Woman

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:54.431

01:16:13.439 --> 01:16:15.743
Not as my caregiver oh my ambassador

01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:21.631
You spent your entire adult life in this place

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:22.911
By my side

01:16:23.423 --> 01:16:24.703

01:17:19.487 --> 01:17:21.535
Queen to princess

I know that we live in different countries

01:18:26.047 --> 01:18:28.607
And we lead very different lives

01:18:29.119 --> 01:18:31.679
I want to start over where we left off

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:39.103
I'm not going to make the same mistake again so whatever it takes

01:18:39.359 --> 01:18:40.895
Entrance

01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:46.271

My ancestors going back

Coppell baseball

01:19:59.743 --> 01:20:00.511
It's Christmas

01:20:01.023 --> 01:20:02.815
As a celebration of the passing

01:20:04.607 --> 01:20:05.119
But this year

01:20:06.655 --> 01:20:07.423
Is very different

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:09.471
Many of you heard the rumor

01:20:09.727 --> 01:20:12.031
Simple taenia has a long lost princess

01:20:17.664 --> 01:20:19.200
But this is not entirely correct

01:20:22.272 --> 01:20:22.784
I do

01:20:23.808 --> 01:20:24.576
Have a daughter

In the life of great privilege

01:20:34.048 --> 01:20:36.864
Wheezing how has been my most cherished experience

01:20:38.656 --> 01:20:41.472
Constitution does not allow for her to be a princess

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.312
But I'm hoping to convince all of you

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:47.872
That means you to Lily

01:20:48.128 --> 01:20:54.272
To change your mind

01:21:00.928 --> 01:21:04.000
In the meantime

01:21:04.256 --> 01:21:06.304
There was a tradition that Christmas ball

01:21:06.816 --> 01:21:08.096
That has long been ignored

01:21:09.632 --> 01:21:10.144
