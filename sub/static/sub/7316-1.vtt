You spend so much time sucking

01:11.992 --> 01:14.242
by all means,
you should be comfortable.

01:15.911 --> 01:18.046
There is a word
for you in English--

01:18.048 --> 01:21.216
scum.

01:21.218 --> 01:24.335
Scum supporting terror

01:24.337 --> 01:26.337

01:26.339 --> 01:28.423

01:28.425 --> 01:30.675

may not be...

01:33.980 --> 01:36.648
the right English word,

01:36.650 --> 01:39.350
since you have lost so
many treasured clients

01:39.352 --> 01:41.653
in recent years.

01:41.655 --> 01:43.071
Like this one.

01:43.073 --> 01:45.106
Ari Haswari.

01:45.108 --> 01:47.692
But he was more
than a client, yes?

01:47.694 --> 01:49.994
You considered him your friend.

01:49.996 --> 01:52.197
I have many friends, Anton.

01:52.199 --> 01:57.869
Ari's death left you with,
how shall I say,

01:57.871 --> 02:02.257
an unhealthy interest
in American agency NCIS.

02:02.259 --> 02:06.094
And now my sources tell me that
an employee of theirs is here,

02:06.096 --> 02:07.712
in Moscow.

02:07.714 --> 02:11.516
You and your people
have been following him.

02:11.518 --> 02:13.718
I know nothing about that.

02:15.054 --> 02:17.806
Stay away from NCIS.

(speaks Russian)

Calm yourself, counselor.

VANCE: I'm sure you've seen him
around the office, Gibbs.

03:13.279 --> 03:16.164
Kevin Hussein,
our systems administrator?

03:16.166 --> 03:18.416
Yeah, “I.T. Kevin.”
What about him?

03:18.418 --> 03:20.034
Could be nothing.

03:20.036 --> 03:22.036
He took leave
without pay this week

03:22.038 --> 03:24.289
to visit a sick
uncle in Moscow.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.590
Uncle apparently
died yesterday,

03:25.592 --> 03:27.759
and while he was
making arrangements

03:27.761 --> 03:30.094
to ship his body
back here for burial,

03:30.096 --> 03:33.932
Kevin got the feeling he was
being watched, followed.

03:33.934 --> 03:36.601
Well, yeah, Leon.
It <i> is</i> Russia.

03:36.603 --> 03:38.353
Russia says
it's not them.

03:38.355 --> 03:40.605
Either way,
he got spooked,

03:40.607 --> 03:42.774
took refuge at our
embassy in Moscow.

03:42.776 --> 03:44.475
Now he needs
safe passage home.

03:44.477 --> 03:47.529
What, someone can't
just put him on a plane?

03:47.531 --> 03:49.731
Kid's a walking database of
naval technology, Gibbs--

03:49.733 --> 03:52.233
a very attractive
target for our enemies.

03:52.235 --> 03:55.737
So, the embassy
contacted SECNAV,

03:55.739 --> 03:58.489
and SECNAV has requested
you to be his escort.

03:58.491 --> 04:00.325
Me.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.578
Like I said,
could be nothing.

04:06.048 --> 04:07.498
TONY: I.T. Kevin,
the computer geek?

04:07.500 --> 04:08.883
BISHOP: He does
comedy improv; sweet guy.

04:08.885 --> 04:11.336
Yeah, I don't know
about the comedy,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.838
but, uh, his improv skills
definitely helped put away

04:13.840 --> 04:15.590
the world's number one
cyber terrorist.

04:15.592 --> 04:17.225
Yet, you still call him a geek.

04:17.226 --> 04:20.678
Yes. Once a geek,
always a geek.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.397
So, uh, what's going on
in Moscow, boss?

04:22.399 --> 04:23.731
Think he's got an
uncle that teaches

04:23.733 --> 04:24.849
at one of the
universities there.

04:24.851 --> 04:27.735
Thank you, boss.
Boss?

04:27.737 --> 04:29.687
Long story,
but one of you are coming.

04:31.407 --> 04:33.575
I don't know if I can go.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.160
Uh, jet lag from that trip
to Spain is still haunting me.

04:36.162 --> 04:38.162
Well, I did just get back
from Dubai.

04:38.164 --> 04:40.198
Yeah, I might have popped a rib
running with those bulls.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.866
Plus, I'm tremendously
out of shape.

04:41.868 --> 04:43.668
All Delilah and I did
was eat and sleep

04:43.670 --> 04:46.838
and eat and, well,
other things.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.840
Fear not,
weary travelers.

04:48.842 --> 04:50.875
After an entire summer
spent house-hunting

04:50.877 --> 04:53.094
with Jake, to no avail,

04:53.096 --> 04:55.463
I would be thrilled to go
just about anywhere, Gibbs.

04:55.465 --> 04:58.132
Nope, Defense Attaché only gave
clearance to senior agents.

04:58.134 --> 05:01.386
Never ask for the job.
Right.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.221
Well, you know Kevin
very well.

05:03.223 --> 05:04.639

put away Ajay Khan.

05:04.641 --> 05:07.208

05:36.588 --> 05:38.389
Oh, my God.
Agent Gibbs.

05:38.391 --> 05:39.974
Wow, they sent
the A-team.

05:39.976 --> 05:41.392
Not that you're not
A-team enough, Tim.

05:41.394 --> 05:42.927
But Agent Gibbs--

05:42.929 --> 05:44.595
I didn't mean to make
extra work for you, sir.

05:44.597 --> 05:45.680
I really didn't.

05:45.682 --> 05:48.266
Breathe, Kev.
Deep breaths.

05:48.268 --> 05:50.351
And I swear I am
not being paranoid.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.270

followed the minute I got here.

05:52.272 --> 05:54.322

05:54.324 --> 05:56.107

06:02.449 --> 06:04.248

hot-air balloon?

06:04.250 --> 06:05.616

what to expect.

06:05.618 --> 06:07.585
How'd you sneak it
past the Russians?

06:07.587 --> 06:09.454
McGEE:
Diplomatic courtesy.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.090
And a couple of ace pilots.

06:12.092 --> 06:14.625
Lieutenant Commander Banks,
Lieutenant Hagen,

06:14.627 --> 06:15.760
say hi to Kevin.

06:15.762 --> 06:16.961
Welcome aboard.
Sorry we're

06:16.963 --> 06:18.796

bit of rough air.

06:18.798 --> 06:20.014
It's no problem, ma'am.

06:20.016 --> 06:21.432
Miss.

06:21.434 --> 06:23.935
We're going out
the same way we came in.

06:23.937 --> 06:27.522
North over the Kola
Peninsula to the Barents Sea.

06:27.524 --> 06:29.023
From there, you'll
take a COD to the UK,

06:29.025 --> 06:30.608
then a C-40
Clipper home.

06:30.610 --> 06:32.193

gentlemen.

06:32.195 --> 06:33.644

and en route.

06:35.982 --> 06:37.148
It's, uh...

06:37.150 --> 06:39.200
it's my first
helicopter ride.

06:39.202 --> 06:40.985
You'd never know.

06:44.823 --> 06:46.574
(vomiting)

06:48.877 --> 06:50.661

06:50.663 --> 06:52.163
No, thanks.

06:52.165 --> 06:54.415
I'll be fine.

06:56.502 --> 06:57.885

06:57.887 --> 06:59.003
what-what was it?

06:59.005 --> 07:00.171

07:00.173 --> 07:02.006
Lung.

07:02.008 --> 07:04.559

07:04.561 --> 07:07.095
Thought he was
on the upswing, but, uh...

07:07.097 --> 07:09.180
Well, at least you got
to send him home.

07:09.182 --> 07:11.265
Not the way I wanted.

07:11.267 --> 07:14.035

09:44.092 --> 09:45.793
Don't move.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.178

09:48.130 --> 09:49.463

about that right now.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.122
Pressure on it.

10:15.124 --> 10:16.207
Kevin?

10:16.209 --> 10:17.491
Right here.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.293
(groans)

10:19.295 --> 10:20.995
Oh, man. I don't believe this.

10:20.997 --> 10:22.630
Somebody find me
the first aid kit.

10:22.632 --> 10:24.465
We left our go-bags
on the ship, boss.

10:24.467 --> 10:27.001
What the hell happened?
Kevin, get me the kit.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.172

10:31.174 --> 10:33.591
Joe, Evans...

10:36.178 --> 10:37.979
KEVIN:
I found it.

10:37.981 --> 10:39.347
Found a kit.

10:39.349 --> 10:40.514
Here.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.687
Go on, help McGee.
Go find some water.

10:51.910 --> 10:54.161
(Banks moans in pain)
<i>Yes, Director Vance.</i>

10:54.163 --> 10:58.199
My office did just receive word
of a possible downed aircraft

10:58.201 --> 10:59.867
somewhere over
the Kola Peninsula.

10:59.869 --> 11:01.535
“Possible”?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.688
I was not aware that
it may have been one of yours.

11:03.690 --> 11:05.756
It is ours,
Mr. Pavlenko.

11:05.758 --> 11:08.275
They were shot down,
we have the Mayday call.

11:08.277 --> 11:10.878
Target of
a surface-to-air missile.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.849
If that is true,
I assure you my government had

11:14.851 --> 11:17.051
absolutely nothing
to do with it.

11:17.053 --> 11:19.053
Then who?

11:19.055 --> 11:20.321
Every nation
has its outlaws.

11:20.323 --> 11:22.223
If there is, uh,

11:22.225 --> 11:24.358
a mercenary group operating
in that region,

11:24.360 --> 11:26.560
I assure you,
they will be found,

11:26.562 --> 11:29.380
and brought to justice.
None of which helps us right now.

11:29.382 --> 11:32.216
With all due respect, counselor,
where are your bosses on this?

11:32.218 --> 11:34.452
DiNozzo...

11:36.288 --> 11:40.875
My superiors will be receiving
updates, Salgent.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.660
As for right now,
Director--

11:42.662 --> 11:45.312
while there is some very dense
forest in that area,

11:45.314 --> 11:46.747
I will request immediately

11:46.749 --> 11:49.316
that search plans are
dispatched for recovery.

11:49.318 --> 11:52.987
Not recovery... rescue.

11:52.989 --> 11:54.839
Of course.

11:54.841 --> 11:57.758
If there are survivors,
I can assure you,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.760
help is on its way.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.145
So, please,

12:01.147 --> 12:03.264
as you might say, gentlemen,

12:03.266 --> 12:04.932
sit tight.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.601
Sit tight?

12:09.988 --> 12:11.155
Just hung up with NSA.

12:11.157 --> 12:13.574
They're combing
the airwaves.

12:13.576 --> 12:15.693
If that helo puts out a signal,
someone will hear it.

12:15.695 --> 12:17.578
He really just
say, “Sit tight”?

12:17.580 --> 12:20.164
Nobody's sitting tight.
Let's move.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.784
Warrior, this is
Echo-Bravo-Nine.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.119
Warrior...

12:25.121 --> 12:26.787
We can forget
about cell reception.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.123
There's a circuit breaker
under the manifold

12:29.125 --> 12:30.424
you can try
restarting.

12:30.426 --> 12:31.842
I see it, Commander.
Thank you.

12:31.844 --> 12:33.377
We've already
tried that.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.513
Then try again.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.636
Our coordinates before
we got hit are in there.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.723
Finland's just west,
about 20 klicks or so.

12:47.526 --> 12:49.560
Well, the radio's a goner.

12:49.562 --> 12:51.979
But I think that I can hook the
transponder up to the battery,

12:51.981 --> 12:53.948
and if I can do that
without frying it,

12:53.950 --> 12:56.033
we should able
to get something out there.

12:56.035 --> 12:58.235
Wait-- “out there,”
like a signal?

12:58.237 --> 13:01.155
Wouldn't that signal whoever
it was that shot us down?

13:05.961 --> 13:08.996
Who did shoot us down, Kevin?

13:08.998 --> 13:10.664
What?

13:10.666 --> 13:11.882
How should I know?

13:11.884 --> 13:14.051
They were following you.

13:14.053 --> 13:15.920
They wanted something from you.

13:15.922 --> 13:19.006
I swear, Gibbs,
I don't know.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.975
Not who they are
or what they want.

13:20.977 --> 13:22.309
Shh. Listen.

13:22.311 --> 13:23.344
(vehicle rumbling in distance)

13:23.346 --> 13:24.845
That's them.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.097
Coming to
finish the job.

13:26.099 --> 13:27.398
We have to get out
of here, please.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.350
Kevin, breathe.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.020
Hey... hey...

13:33.022 --> 13:34.155
it's okay.

13:34.157 --> 13:36.240
He's right. Go.

13:36.242 --> 13:38.342
Nah.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.277
We're not going anywhere.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.374
(missile whistling
through air)

13:57.376 --> 13:58.542
BANKS: We've been hit!

13:58.544 --> 13:59.960
HAGEN:
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

13:59.962 --> 14:01.462
This is Echo-Bravo-Nine.

14:01.464 --> 14:04.598
Position 6-7-3-3, decimal...
(radio static)

14:06.518 --> 14:07.968
Don't torture yourself, Abby.

14:07.970 --> 14:12.523
I just keep thinking
I'll find something, Jimmy.

14:12.525 --> 14:14.725
Something that will help them.

14:14.727 --> 14:16.877
Somehow.

14:16.879 --> 14:18.896
It's a damn needle
in a haystack.

14:18.898 --> 14:21.899
Kola Peninsula is
the size of Kentucky.

14:21.901 --> 14:23.817
Their flight pattern
north to the carrier

14:23.819 --> 14:25.536
was right along
Finland's border.

14:25.538 --> 14:27.288
Yeah, spanning
400 kilometers.

14:27.290 --> 14:30.407
250 miles.
BISHOP: All right, let me know.

14:31.242 --> 14:32.660
Still no distress signal,

14:32.662 --> 14:34.712
but I'm pulling some strings
with the NSA

14:34.714 --> 14:36.080
to get us some deeper access.

14:36.082 --> 14:39.750
Well, let's leave
no string unpulled.

14:39.752 --> 14:41.919
Finland's an ally.
Why don't we...

14:41.921 --> 14:43.420
launch a search party
from over there?

14:43.422 --> 14:44.972
Russia would never allow it.

14:44.974 --> 14:47.257
But we've put
Finland on alert.

14:47.259 --> 14:49.226
For diplomatic reasons,

14:49.228 --> 14:51.061
SECNAV says we have
to give the Russians

14:51.063 --> 14:53.230
first crack at
search and rescue.

14:53.232 --> 14:54.815
So our friends are out there,

14:54.817 --> 14:56.600
and they're worried
about saving face?

14:56.602 --> 14:58.435
They should start
by reeling in those jokers

14:58.437 --> 15:00.654
running around with
surface-to-air launchers.

15:00.656 --> 15:02.489
The missile.

15:02.491 --> 15:03.991
What?

15:03.993 --> 15:06.443
I don't know.

15:07.946 --> 15:09.780
JIMMY:
Excuse me, Director...

15:09.782 --> 15:12.366
has anyone told
Kevin's family yet?

15:12.368 --> 15:15.085
I'm sure whoever's expecting
to pick up his uncle's body

15:15.087 --> 15:18.589
from Moscow would surely want
to know about this.

15:18.591 --> 15:21.291
Family notifications are
your wheelhouse, Doctor.

15:21.293 --> 15:22.960
Would you mind?

15:22.962 --> 15:26.296
My kingdom for a
smaller wheelhouse.

15:26.298 --> 15:27.798
How much should
I tell them?

15:27.800 --> 15:29.466
Just that he's missing.

15:29.468 --> 15:31.018
Every effort's being made.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.519
No specifics.

15:32.521 --> 15:34.471
That's hardly a challenge.

15:34.473 --> 15:37.391
All we seem to have
are unknowns.

15:40.228 --> 15:42.396
(wolf howls in distance)

15:43.698 --> 15:45.149
(Sergei whistles)

15:47.318 --> 15:49.536
It's quite an accident, my dear.

15:55.710 --> 15:57.327
Hmm.

15:57.329 --> 16:00.381
The passengers.

16:00.383 --> 16:03.584
Where are Hussein
and the special agents?

16:03.586 --> 16:05.169
I don't know.

16:05.171 --> 16:08.338
Thrown in
the crash.

16:12.060 --> 16:13.594
The truth could save your life.

16:36.768 --> 16:39.086
Let the liar bleed to death.

16:39.604 --> 16:40.788
Flashlight.

16:54.886 --> 16:58.472
You... beautiful...

17:00.191 --> 17:02.392
...not so clever.

17:11.736 --> 17:14.738
(missile whooshing,
then exploding)

17:15.906 --> 17:17.324
(remote blips)

17:17.326 --> 17:21.328
(missile whooshing,
then exploding)

17:22.079 --> 17:23.413
You hear that?

17:24.915 --> 17:27.550
That's the missile hitting
the helo's tail.

17:27.553 --> 17:28.752
How can we
<i>not</i> hear it?

17:28.754 --> 17:30.003
Can you turn
that down?

17:32.757 --> 17:36.093
I was able to isolate the sound
from the Mayday call.

17:36.095 --> 17:37.594
That's great, Abbs.

17:37.596 --> 17:38.645
But are you okay?

17:38.647 --> 17:40.564
Me? Oh. No.

17:40.566 --> 17:42.015
No, not at all.

17:42.017 --> 17:45.269
Two of the most important
people in our lives

17:45.271 --> 17:46.737
just got shot out of the sky,

17:46.739 --> 17:49.773
and until I can figure out
how to help them,

17:49.775 --> 17:52.693
I-I don't... I'm just...
I'm gonna lose it.

17:54.329 --> 17:56.613
Well, we're right there
with you, Abby.

17:56.615 --> 17:58.782
But if one
of us loses it,

17:58.784 --> 18:02.786
we all lose it,
including Gibbs and McGee.

18:04.339 --> 18:05.923
Well, I, um...

18:05.925 --> 18:09.126
I'm not gonna actually lose it,
I just...

18:09.128 --> 18:11.545
I mean, what do we do,
if Gibbs and McGee...?

18:11.547 --> 18:13.463
Abby...

18:13.465 --> 18:17.184
do you know that the odds of
surviving a helicopter crash

18:17.186 --> 18:18.769
are surprisingly high.

18:18.771 --> 18:21.638
Statistically, much higher
than a plane crash.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.857
Like two out of three.

18:23.859 --> 18:25.442
Really?
Mm-hmm.

18:25.444 --> 18:28.445
So, I'm just...
I'm not going there, okay?

18:28.447 --> 18:30.113
I refuse to think the worst.

18:30.115 --> 18:31.481
TONY: And I refuse
to listen

18:31.483 --> 18:33.200
to that missile hit
the helicopter again.

18:33.202 --> 18:34.952
How about you?

18:34.954 --> 18:36.320
I won't. I had to.

18:36.322 --> 18:38.155
So I could identify
the missile.

18:38.157 --> 18:40.240
You what?
Well, not me,

18:40.242 --> 18:44.328
but my friend Augie, he's a
Marine anti-aircraft gunner,

18:44.330 --> 18:45.796
and he's stationed in Kuwait.

18:45.798 --> 18:48.415
If anyone knows what
that sound is, he does.

18:48.417 --> 18:49.583
You played it
for him?

18:49.585 --> 18:50.801
Yeah, over the phone.

18:50.803 --> 18:54.004
He immediately
identified it as...

18:54.006 --> 18:57.174
A 9K-32 STRELA-2 portable
surface-to-air missile.

18:57.176 --> 18:58.926
That's... that's amazing.

18:58.928 --> 19:00.510
Amazing and...

19:00.512 --> 19:01.845
And it turns out

19:01.847 --> 19:04.681
that a huge cache of STRELA-2s

19:04.683 --> 19:07.484
were stolen from a Libyan
stockpile two years ago.

19:07.486 --> 19:10.437
The suspects
were mercenaries

19:10.439 --> 19:13.190
that were funded
by Russian oligarchs.

19:13.192 --> 19:15.192
Very bad guys.

19:15.194 --> 19:16.360
Okay.

19:16.362 --> 19:17.411
Names and faces.

19:17.413 --> 19:19.329
I'm working on it.

19:19.331 --> 19:23.033
And I'm not gonna
lose it, I promise.

19:26.671 --> 19:29.039
What are you looking for?

19:29.041 --> 19:31.208
I no find.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.343
I go.

19:33.345 --> 19:36.046
You die slow.

19:37.415 --> 19:40.384
Is bad.

19:44.973 --> 19:48.308
You are... beautiful.

19:48.310 --> 19:50.811
I like.

20:07.578 --> 20:08.738
I've seen dead people before,

20:08.880 --> 20:10.464
but never actually
anyone killed.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.250
You want to see another one?

20:13.252 --> 20:14.252
No, not really.

20:14.253 --> 20:15.669
What do you have, Kevin?

20:15.671 --> 20:17.587
And don't say
“nothing.”

20:17.589 --> 20:18.989
He was looking for something.

20:18.991 --> 20:19.973
What is it?

20:19.975 --> 20:21.808
Uh...

20:21.810 --> 20:23.677
Boss.

20:23.679 --> 20:25.095
She's not looking good.

20:28.316 --> 20:31.518
GIBBS:
Ah, Banks... hang on.

20:33.438 --> 20:35.939
My team is frustrated,
Madame Secretary.

20:35.941 --> 20:37.607
And I can't say
that I blame them.

20:37.609 --> 20:38.609
(knocking on door)

20:38.610 --> 20:41.695
Yes, I know, but...

20:42.914 --> 20:44.498
Of course.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.501
Yes, I'll keep
you posted.

20:49.587 --> 20:53.090
A truly surreal day,
Director.

20:53.092 --> 20:54.408
Why do I have the feeling

20:54.410 --> 20:56.093
that you're not
about to make it better?

20:56.095 --> 20:57.260
(wry chuckle)

20:57.262 --> 21:00.380
Only more bizarre, I'm afraid.

21:00.382 --> 21:03.800
It seems the only
remaining family

21:03.802 --> 21:07.971
of young Mr. Hussein
is a sister in Buffalo,

21:07.973 --> 21:12.609
who knew nothing about his
current trip to Moscow.

21:12.611 --> 21:14.311
And the uncle?

21:14.313 --> 21:19.483
Edgar Hussein had indeed been
fighting lung cancer,

21:19.485 --> 21:23.370
but Kevin's sister had no idea
that he'd passed away.

21:23.372 --> 21:28.158
In fact, it was her belief
that he had gone into remission.

21:30.328 --> 21:33.997
So... so what
are we saying?

21:33.999 --> 21:39.586
Well, I took the liberty of
calling our embassy in Moscow.

21:39.588 --> 21:43.173
They confirmed shipment
of the remains yesterday,

21:43.175 --> 21:48.678
sent by Kevin,
to a funeral home

21:48.680 --> 21:51.815
not far from his apartment
in Fairfax.

21:51.817 --> 21:53.683
Get that body
over here, Doctor.

21:53.685 --> 21:57.571
Uh, I already took
that liberty, as well.

21:57.573 --> 21:59.740
The body arrives
at Dulles shortly.

21:59.742 --> 22:02.826
Mr. Palmer is
on his way to get it.

22:02.828 --> 22:06.446
And I, frankly,
cannot wait to see it.

22:11.202 --> 22:12.502
Banks?

22:12.504 --> 22:13.870
Banks!

22:13.872 --> 22:15.172
Talk to me, Banks.

22:15.174 --> 22:18.492
(wolf howling in distance)

22:18.494 --> 22:19.593
(gasps, weakly):
Hannah.

22:19.595 --> 22:22.879
Hannah...

22:22.881 --> 22:25.682
Where you from, Hannah?

22:25.684 --> 22:28.435
What hometown?

22:28.437 --> 22:31.438
I tried to steer clear, Gibbs.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.891
I couldn't shake it.

22:34.893 --> 22:38.111
Hey, you are one hell
of a pilot.

22:38.113 --> 22:41.731
(grunts)

22:41.733 --> 22:44.534
My mom will want these.
No...

22:44.536 --> 22:49.122
no... no, you give those
to her yourself.

22:49.124 --> 22:52.409
Hannah, stay with me.

22:52.411 --> 22:53.577
Hannah!

22:53.579 --> 22:56.630
You stay with me.

22:56.632 --> 22:58.915
Hannah, tell me about your dad.

22:58.917 --> 23:02.252
Where's your dad?

23:03.087 --> 23:05.639
Hannah?

23:09.260 --> 23:11.478
Right there.

23:34.452 --> 23:36.953
Help me get her
inside.

23:42.677 --> 23:43.877
(grunting with effort)

23:43.879 --> 23:46.379
SERGEI (over radio):
Yuri.

23:48.299 --> 23:49.716
Oh, man, are you kidding me?

23:49.718 --> 23:51.685
Kevin, shut up.
Look, I feel terrible.

23:51.687 --> 23:53.270
But if nobody
answers that,

23:53.272 --> 23:54.804
then they're coming back.

23:54.806 --> 23:59.309
And real soon.

23:59.311 --> 24:02.312
All right. Gear up.

24:07.034 --> 24:08.485
So, Finland, right?

24:08.487 --> 24:10.654
20 klicks,
she said.

24:10.656 --> 24:12.405
Kilometers, that's about, uh,

24:12.407 --> 24:13.623
12 miles?

24:13.625 --> 24:15.992
It's 12 hard miles.

24:15.994 --> 24:17.410
I ran a mini marathon last year.

24:18.162 --> 24:19.746
Don't worry
about me.

24:23.050 --> 24:24.668
Now, boss, if we get
to higher ground,

24:24.670 --> 24:26.503
I may be able to send out
a signal

24:26.505 --> 24:28.889
or even a call for help.

24:41.519 --> 24:44.104
Higher ground it is.

24:59.736 --> 25:01.537
Is that the uncle?

25:01.539 --> 25:03.322
Yes, Edgar Hussein.

25:03.324 --> 25:05.992
61, visiting
professor at the Moscow

25:05.994 --> 25:08.160
Engineering Institute.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.137
I think we can rule out cancer.

25:18.139 --> 25:20.506
DUCKY:
Two bullet wounds?

25:20.508 --> 25:24.927
A detail Kevin somehow neglected
to tell the U.S. Embassy.

25:24.929 --> 25:28.564
Which would clearly implicate
him as the possible killer.

25:28.566 --> 25:30.099
Oh, come on.

25:30.101 --> 25:31.601
Kevin?
I can't see him doing this.

25:31.603 --> 25:33.486
And why would
he ship the body home?

25:33.488 --> 25:35.738
It'd pretty much guarantee him
not getting away with it.

25:35.740 --> 25:37.523
Unless he named himself
as the only one authorized

25:37.525 --> 25:39.075
to receive the body.

25:39.776 --> 25:41.410
We need answers, Doctor.

25:41.412 --> 25:44.080
Well, if Uncle Edgar
can provide them,

25:44.082 --> 25:46.032
you shall have them.

25:46.034 --> 25:48.701
I'll start on the X-rays.

25:56.043 --> 25:57.710
Thought that only
worked in movies.

25:57.712 --> 26:00.713
And it's dead-on accurate.

26:02.182 --> 26:05.101
Uh, Boy Scout motto, boss:
always be prepared.

26:05.103 --> 26:06.719
Sorry, I didn't realize
I had it

26:06.721 --> 26:08.354
until you were halfway done,
and by then,

26:08.356 --> 26:10.056
I-I was just curious
to see it work.

26:10.058 --> 26:12.224
20 klicks, McGee, huh?

26:12.226 --> 26:15.061
Minus two or three?
At least. I'd say

26:15.063 --> 26:16.228
we probably got another...

26:16.230 --> 26:18.064
17 to go.

26:18.066 --> 26:21.284
What? 17.

26:21.286 --> 26:22.585
Let's do it.

26:22.587 --> 26:24.954
Save your water.

26:24.956 --> 26:26.238
Right.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.623
And, again, Agent Gibbs,

26:27.625 --> 26:30.493
that leaf thing, very cool.

26:32.079 --> 26:33.713
For something so small,

26:33.715 --> 26:36.048
it practically leapt
off the screen.

26:36.050 --> 26:37.750
You can see the two bullets
in the chest cavity

26:37.752 --> 26:40.169
here and here, but this...

26:40.171 --> 26:42.054
That's no bullet.
DUCKY: Well, whatever it is,

26:42.056 --> 26:44.924
Director,
it's only an inch deep.

26:51.815 --> 26:53.015
Some kind
of micro SD card?

26:53.017 --> 26:55.601
Yes, it appears
that Kevin's uncle

26:55.603 --> 26:58.187
was murdered and used as a mule.

26:58.189 --> 27:00.106
For whatever's stored
in that thing.

27:00.108 --> 27:01.774
Let's get that to Ms. Sciuto.

27:04.528 --> 27:07.747
Quick breather, boss?
(sighs)  (panting)

27:07.749 --> 27:09.281
McGEE (groans):
Dubai...

27:09.283 --> 27:10.950
Told you I'm out of shape.

27:10.952 --> 27:12.752
Go ahead.

27:12.754 --> 27:14.837
Say “I told you so.”

27:14.839 --> 27:16.288
Can I get a sip of yours?

27:16.290 --> 27:17.290
No.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.674
Not you,
Agent Gibbs.

27:18.676 --> 27:19.792
I was asking McGee.

27:19.794 --> 27:21.127
And I asked you
something back there,

27:21.129 --> 27:22.878
and I'm done waiting
for an answer.

27:23.964 --> 27:25.348
You're not getting any water

27:25.350 --> 27:27.183
until we get one.

27:29.636 --> 27:32.855
Fit Vito my uncle
was a few months ago.

27:32.857 --> 27:36.308
I was approached
by this guy, Sergei.

27:36.310 --> 27:39.028
Which may not even be
his real name, but he offered

27:39.030 --> 27:43.649
very serious money for this...
this thing that he needed.

27:44.484 --> 27:46.318
What thing?

27:46.320 --> 27:48.070
It's kind of a weapon.

27:48.072 --> 27:49.955
I only agreed

27:49.957 --> 27:52.541
so I could help my uncle
with his medical costs.

27:52.543 --> 27:54.493
But when I came to deliver
this week,

27:54.495 --> 27:56.328
my conscience got
the better of me.

27:56.330 --> 27:58.214
So you backed out of the deal.

27:58.216 --> 28:00.166
I tried to.

28:00.168 --> 28:05.171
But when I got to my uncle's
place, he'd been shot to death.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.675
The man was like a father to me,
and I got him killed.

28:09.677 --> 28:11.677
All I could think
to do was

28:11.679 --> 28:14.597
to not make it worse
by giving in to Sergei.

28:14.599 --> 28:16.148
Where's the weapon now?

28:16.150 --> 28:18.517
With my uncle. In my uncle.

28:18.519 --> 28:21.404
Just how small a weapon is it?

28:21.406 --> 28:23.689
It's a... microdisk.

28:23.691 --> 28:25.157
Computer virus.

28:25.159 --> 28:26.826
Sergei wanted to use it
on defense systems,

28:26.828 --> 28:29.495
which would be very bad,
especially since

28:29.497 --> 28:31.747
I'm kind of the only one
that can deactivate it.

28:31.749 --> 28:33.032
Kind of?
It's a prototype.

28:33.034 --> 28:36.035
A few more months
of testing wouldn't hurt.

28:36.037 --> 28:39.004
But that's not
a problem now, guys.

28:39.006 --> 28:41.040
My uncle's body
should be home soon,

28:41.042 --> 28:42.842
and no one can get to it but me.

28:42.844 --> 28:45.044
Long as no one plugs in
that microdisk,

28:45.046 --> 28:46.762
there's no danger.

28:46.764 --> 28:47.847
No danger?

28:47.849 --> 28:49.682
What, are you delusional?

28:49.684 --> 28:52.101
Think about who you've been
working with the last few years.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.853
They'll get the body.

28:53.855 --> 28:55.938
And Abby will
get the microdisk.

28:59.309 --> 29:02.361
Partial print is Kevin's, and
the blood damage is minimal.

29:02.363 --> 29:04.196
But, considering
where you found this baby,

29:04.198 --> 29:06.816
there's no way I'm just gonna
jam it into our network.

29:06.818 --> 29:09.118
Which would explain the
purpose of this contraption.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.955
The laptop
isolates the SD card

29:12.957 --> 29:15.791
and the cage isolates the laptop

29:15.793 --> 29:17.877
from the rest of our network...

29:17.879 --> 29:19.912
Okay, time's kind of a
factor here, Abbs.

29:22.582 --> 29:24.250
Oh. I'd go with the cat.

29:24.252 --> 29:26.085
Yeah, most of us would but...

29:26.087 --> 29:27.419
WMD.

29:27.421 --> 29:28.554
WMD?

29:28.556 --> 29:29.755
What Would McGee Do?

29:29.757 --> 29:31.590
That's two Ws, Abbs.

29:31.592 --> 29:33.259
Whatever.

29:33.261 --> 29:34.810
If there's one thing that McGee
has taught me,

29:34.812 --> 29:37.346
it's to never click
on an unfamiliar icon

29:37.348 --> 29:38.764
that's telling you
to click on it.

29:38.766 --> 29:40.432
The old “shark and the kitty”
head fake?

29:40.434 --> 29:41.934
Yeah, but what
if it's a double fake?

29:41.936 --> 29:43.486
Like trying to get me
ck on the shark.

29:43.488 --> 29:44.937
What would McGee do,
Ms. Sciuto?

29:44.939 --> 29:48.157
(sighs) McGee would put up
a virus scanner

29:48.159 --> 29:52.611
and build a firewall.

29:55.115 --> 29:58.784
Okay... Here, kitty, kitty.

29:58.786 --> 30:00.536
(kitty yowling)

30:01.371 --> 30:02.651
Should have gone with the shark.

30:03.757 --> 30:04.456
What's happening?

30:04.458 --> 30:08.093
(computer blipping)

30:08.095 --> 30:10.012
What about the firewall?
It ate right through it.

30:10.014 --> 30:12.932
A-And then it bypassed the cage
through the power cord.

30:12.934 --> 30:14.800
Whatever
can do this,

30:14.802 --> 30:17.186
I am gonna need help to stop it.
And fast.

30:17.188 --> 30:18.470
Let's go.

30:19.940 --> 30:24.310
McGee, where are you?

30:26.112 --> 30:27.813
Do you think it's possible
we could've shaken these guys?

30:27.815 --> 30:29.698
No. Keep your eyes open.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.450
Oh, boss,
I got a signal.

30:31.452 --> 30:34.036
(beeping)
(rapid blipping)

30:34.038 --> 30:35.871
These damn things
won't let me shut 'em down.

30:35.873 --> 30:38.157
It's even messing with our phones.
VANCE: Got every

30:38.159 --> 30:40.042
available I.T. helping
Ms. Sciuto, and not one

30:40.044 --> 30:41.627
of them knows
what the hell it is.

30:41.629 --> 30:44.246
We know one I.T. who does.

30:44.831 --> 30:46.081
Or did.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.133
(phone rings)
Whoever it is, not now.

30:48.135 --> 30:49.668
McGEE:
Tony, wait, it's me.

30:49.670 --> 30:51.086
McGee.

30:51.088 --> 30:52.972
Is Gibbs with you?

30:52.974 --> 30:55.891
Yeah. It's, uh, myself,
Gibbs and Kevin.

30:55.893 --> 30:57.676
Our two pilots and a crewman
are dead.

30:57.678 --> 30:59.011
GIBBS:
DiNozzo,

30:59.013 --> 31:01.063
if anyone there finds
a computer disk,

31:01.065 --> 31:02.431
do not open it.

31:02.433 --> 31:05.150
Repeat, do not access the disk.

31:05.152 --> 31:08.187
Ah. Well, we would need
a time machine, boss.

31:08.189 --> 31:10.356
Unfortunately, it's a computer
Armageddon around here.

31:10.358 --> 31:12.241
Does Kevin know any quick fixes?

31:12.243 --> 31:14.193
Not quick, that's for sure.

31:14.195 --> 31:15.694
I could try working
something out.

31:15.696 --> 31:16.779
Do it.

31:16.781 --> 31:18.280
Stand by on that, Leon.

31:18.282 --> 31:19.698
Sitrep.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.700
Are you in danger?

31:20.701 --> 31:22.034
McGEE:
Affirmative, sir.

31:22.036 --> 31:24.036
Shot down and being pursued.

31:24.038 --> 31:25.337
We're headed towards Finland.

31:25.339 --> 31:26.872
Do you know your
coordinates?

31:26.874 --> 31:28.624
Just where we went down.

31:30.844 --> 31:34.847
Uh, latitude: North 67, 33.6.

31:34.849 --> 31:37.850
Longitude:
East 30, 46.6.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.385
Get down!
(gunshots)

31:39.387 --> 31:40.402
(grunts)

31:40.404 --> 31:41.804
(static)

31:42.722 --> 31:43.856
Gibbs?

31:43.858 --> 31:45.391
(Kevin moans)

31:51.364 --> 31:53.232
Oh, my God.
I'm hit.

31:53.234 --> 31:54.900
I can't believe
I'm hit.

31:56.236 --> 31:57.453
(moans)

31:57.455 --> 31:59.371
(McGee sighs)

31:59.373 --> 32:01.156
That's a deep gash.
Through and through.

32:01.158 --> 32:02.875
Through and through?
Is that bad?

32:02.877 --> 32:04.126
McGee.

32:05.295 --> 32:07.463
Hold this.
Press down on this.

32:16.890 --> 32:20.509
So which NCIS man
killed our Yuri?

32:21.678 --> 32:23.262
(over radio):
No one else needs to die.

32:23.264 --> 32:24.480
(moans)

32:24.482 --> 32:26.565
Just give up the traitor

32:26.567 --> 32:28.600
and walk away.

32:28.602 --> 32:29.985
Traitor?

32:29.987 --> 32:32.771
He means me.
Please...

32:32.773 --> 32:35.157
No one is leaving you.

32:35.159 --> 32:36.159
(moans)

32:44.417 --> 32:46.452
Get ready to run.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.954
All right?

32:55.345 --> 32:56.962
Go!
Come on.

32:56.964 --> 32:58.380
(shouts in Russian)

33:03.636 --> 33:05.971
(speaks Russian)

33:05.973 --> 33:07.473
(gunfire ceases)

33:07.475 --> 33:08.974
(shouts in Russian)

33:11.311 --> 33:13.896
(sighs) Okay, whatever phone
they were on is dead.

33:13.898 --> 33:15.981
And ours aren't
much better.

33:15.983 --> 33:17.316
Doesn't matter-- they're alive,

33:17.318 --> 33:19.234
we have the coordinates,
we know where they are.

33:19.236 --> 33:21.153
Jet's fueled and ready,
DiNozzo. Get on it.

33:21.155 --> 33:23.322
I am on it.

33:26.659 --> 33:28.827
(elevator bell dings)

33:37.670 --> 33:39.755
Guys, there's a path back there.

33:39.757 --> 33:41.890
We know.
Then why are we stopping?

33:41.892 --> 33:43.675
I know it's getting dark,
but it's, what,

33:43.677 --> 33:45.477
like, another
three miles?

33:45.479 --> 33:48.230
We won't make three miles
with you slowing us down.

33:48.232 --> 33:49.648
We're not carrying you.

33:49.650 --> 33:51.517
Or freezing to death.

33:52.685 --> 33:55.154
Sit down, Kevin.

33:55.156 --> 33:57.573
(soft grunt)
Some fire.

33:57.575 --> 33:59.158
(groans)

33:59.160 --> 34:01.410
I'd worry about giving up
our position, but...

34:01.412 --> 34:04.029
looks like there's no,
uh, danger of that.

34:08.534 --> 34:10.418
Boy Scout motto, McGee.

34:11.621 --> 34:13.705
Carry a lighter.

34:23.216 --> 34:25.300
Okay, fine, so we're warm.

34:25.302 --> 34:27.351
But Sergei's
still coming.

34:27.353 --> 34:29.605
Solve one problem
at a time.

34:29.607 --> 34:32.190
What do you mean? What problem?

34:32.193 --> 34:34.893
Can't go any further
until you stop bleeding.

34:36.112 --> 34:37.780
All right, bite down on this.

34:37.782 --> 34:38.782
(gasps)

34:38.783 --> 34:41.065
(screams)

34:41.068 --> 34:43.152
(groaning)

34:44.904 --> 34:46.237
All right, done.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.739
Me, too.

34:47.741 --> 34:51.076
(groans, whimpers in pain)

34:51.078 --> 34:54.129
What are you doing?
Gibbs...

34:54.130 --> 34:55.797
there's no way
they won't see that.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.251
Well, that would be the plan.

35:12.867 --> 35:14.901
VANCE: Delivery.
Thanks.

35:16.403 --> 35:17.904
Anything else we can do?

35:17.906 --> 35:20.240
I really wish
there was, Director.

35:20.242 --> 35:22.408
(phone rings)

35:22.410 --> 35:24.577
It's Jake. NSA.

35:24.579 --> 35:26.079
Uh, Jimmy, take over from here.

35:26.081 --> 35:28.631
Me?
Yeah, just hit “Enter” when Abby says.

35:28.633 --> 35:29.999
Hey, Jake.

35:30.001 --> 35:31.584
All right,
I'm-I'm saying it now.

35:31.586 --> 35:32.969
Like, “now” right now?
Now,

35:32.971 --> 35:34.754
okay, o-on three.

35:34.756 --> 35:36.105
One...

35:36.107 --> 35:38.474
two...

35:38.476 --> 35:40.677
now.
(rapid beeping)

35:44.982 --> 35:46.683
Looks better already.

35:46.685 --> 35:47.817
For the moment.

35:47.819 --> 35:48.985
I've just got to

35:48.987 --> 35:50.937
come up with
some more red meat.

35:50.939 --> 35:52.522
Well, keep at it.

35:52.524 --> 35:54.691
And if you can think of anything
else that you need.

35:55.776 --> 35:57.410
I need...

35:57.412 --> 36:00.663
Gibbs and McGee
to come back alive.

36:12.993 --> 36:15.728
(engine stops)

36:39.653 --> 36:41.871
(speaks Russian)
...NCIS.

36:50.631 --> 36:52.915
(shouts in Russian)

37:16.190 --> 37:18.358
Don't stop. Keep moving.

37:23.864 --> 37:25.531
What have you
got, Bishop?

37:25.533 --> 37:26.916
Access, Director.

37:26.918 --> 37:29.202
Well, hasn't your computer
been corrupted?

37:29.204 --> 37:31.037
Oh, I'm on NSA's network,
Ducky, not ours.

37:31.039 --> 37:34.290
My husband patched me in
and MTAC routed our request

37:34.292 --> 37:37.210
for an infrared GPS
satellite feed through DOD.

37:38.379 --> 37:39.545
And, wow, okay, there it is.

37:39.547 --> 37:41.047
Here are the coordinates

37:41.049 --> 37:43.766
where the helo was hit.

37:43.768 --> 37:45.768
BISHOP: Where it landed
is anyone's guess.

37:45.770 --> 37:47.020
VANCE:
Close enough.

37:47.022 --> 37:49.555
Can you pan west?
Mm-hmm.

37:51.392 --> 37:52.775
What was that?

37:52.777 --> 37:54.060
Can you zoom in?

37:55.396 --> 37:57.280
BISHOP: Got to be a fire
of some kind.

37:57.282 --> 37:59.565
Pan slowly between
whatever it is

37:59.567 --> 38:01.401
BISHOP: Got to be a fire
and Finland's border.

38:04.538 --> 38:06.572
There. Could that be them?

38:06.574 --> 38:08.291
They're moving pretty

38:08.293 --> 38:09.409
fast on foot.

38:09.411 --> 38:10.960
Like they're being chased.

38:15.749 --> 38:17.917
Or chasing those three.

38:20.087 --> 38:21.421
That's got to be our guys.

38:21.423 --> 38:24.006
Tightly configured--
as though those two

38:24.008 --> 38:26.509
are assisting the third.

38:28.095 --> 38:29.429
SERGEI (over radio):
You think we're stopped?

38:29.431 --> 38:31.230
We never stop.

38:31.232 --> 38:34.150
And you will never leave.
What is this guy, the Terminator?

38:34.152 --> 38:36.069
Turn it off, Tim.

38:36.071 --> 38:38.071
KEVIN:
Wait...

38:38.073 --> 38:39.939
why are we stopping?

38:41.024 --> 38:43.109
Take him, Tim, keep going.

38:45.195 --> 38:47.780
No, boss... boss,
we're not leaving you.

38:47.782 --> 38:50.116
I'm with Tim.
We've come this far.

38:50.118 --> 38:54.120
We're not gonna get any farther
unless someone slows 'em down.

38:54.122 --> 38:55.538
I'll stay.

38:56.957 --> 38:58.091
McGee...

38:58.093 --> 38:59.842
Boss.

38:59.844 --> 39:02.128
I'll be right behind you.

39:04.965 --> 39:06.516
Go on.

39:06.518 --> 39:08.468
Get out of here.

39:08.470 --> 39:10.636
Keep going.

39:17.811 --> 39:19.228
Who-Who's that
splitting off?

39:23.117 --> 39:25.201
Oh, dear.

39:38.382 --> 39:39.665
(gunshot)
(grunts)

39:54.164 --> 39:57.350
You made this too difficult,
Agent Gibbs.

40:19.423 --> 40:23.543
(wolf howls in distance)

40:38.058 --> 40:39.809
(vehicle approaching)

40:44.648 --> 40:46.649
(brakes squeak)

40:48.118 --> 40:49.819
Boss, get in the truck.

40:55.542 --> 40:57.243
Hey, we're 100 yards
from the Russian border,

40:57.245 --> 40:59.412
we got to go.
Not without the helo crew.

40:59.414 --> 41:01.881
Gotta go; Kremlin says
they'll get 'em home.

41:01.883 --> 41:03.082
Finns want to get back

41:03.084 --> 41:04.550
across the border.

41:04.552 --> 41:05.668
(engine revs)

41:05.670 --> 41:07.637
Let's move.

41:18.215 --> 41:20.650
(distant howling)

41:29.576 --> 41:31.777
(door creaks open)

41:38.752 --> 41:40.586
Another boat?

41:40.588 --> 41:42.288
Hm.

41:45.175 --> 41:46.676
You planning another trip?

41:46.678 --> 41:48.844
Not anytime soon.

41:49.963 --> 41:51.764
Ms. Sciuto will be weeks

41:51.766 --> 41:54.300
cleaning up the damage
from the virus.

41:54.302 --> 41:57.687
Kevin, he was helpful, but he's
still looking at serious time.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.472
Mm.

41:59.474 --> 42:01.641
Well, I will bet you didn't
come all the way down here

42:01.643 --> 42:03.059
to just tell me that, Leon.

42:06.863 --> 42:09.315
VANCE:
Look familiar?

42:09.317 --> 42:11.901
Sergei Mishnev.

42:11.903 --> 42:14.236
International mercenary.

42:14.238 --> 42:16.322
Funded by oligarchs.

42:16.324 --> 42:17.990
Long list of offenses.

42:17.992 --> 42:20.126
Yeah. Well, the only one
that matters is he killed

42:20.128 --> 42:21.827
two pilots
and a petty officer.

42:21.829 --> 42:25.498
Not if you consider his
friendship with Ari Haswari.

42:26.667 --> 42:28.084
Seems his deal with Kevin

42:28.086 --> 42:31.003
may have just been
a plan to get back at us.

42:31.005 --> 42:33.723
His plan backfired.

42:33.725 --> 42:37.009
No, Gibbs.

42:39.513 --> 42:42.431
Our Intel says Sergei survived.

42:45.018 --> 42:47.186
What?

42:49.356 --> 42:51.357
How? I hit him.

42:51.359 --> 42:52.942
He went down.

42:52.944 --> 42:54.860
He got up.

42:54.862 --> 42:57.580
No body was recovered.

42:57.582 --> 43:00.282
And wherever he is now,
knowing all this,

43:00.284 --> 43:04.370
there's a good chance
he'll be gunning for us.

43:15.799 --> 43:18.050
Not if we find him first.
