WEBVTT

00:49.656 --> 00:51.696
Ready, Glossaryck?

00:51.696 --> 00:53.896
- Here comes the airplane.

00:53.896 --> 00:54.986
Globgore, globgore.

00:54.986 --> 00:57.816
Come on, Glossaryck.
Be a good boy.

00:59.776 --> 01:01.066
Glossaryck,
what have I told you?

01:01.066 --> 01:03.896
We express ourselves
with our words,

01:03.896 --> 01:05.526
not our pudding.

01:05.526 --> 01:08.196
- Globgore!

01:08.196 --> 01:09.696
Oh, Glossaryck.

01:09.696 --> 01:11.026
Here, boy.

01:11.026 --> 01:12.486
- Do you wanna...

01:12.486 --> 01:14.606
...go for a walk?

01:14.606 --> 01:15.896
Globgore!

01:15.896 --> 01:18.736
Glossaryck, slow down!

01:18.736 --> 01:20.486
Globgore, globgore.

01:21.816 --> 01:23.816
Glossaryck,
what the heck?

01:23.816 --> 01:25.696
Stop that,
bad Glossaryck.

01:25.696 --> 01:27.446
Are we gonna have to go
back into the diaper,

01:27.446 --> 01:28.736
'cause I will do it.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.066
Globgore!

01:32.066 --> 01:33.566
Ah, Glossaryck!

01:33.566 --> 01:36.316
Globgore!
No!

01:40.946 --> 01:42.566
Oh, Glossaryck!

01:42.566 --> 01:44.156
Oh, my goodness.

01:44.156 --> 01:45.776
I am so sorry
about your roses.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.736
He... oh!

01:47.736 --> 01:49.896
Don't worry.
They're just flowers.

01:49.896 --> 01:51.736
It's not like they're
something really cool,

01:51.736 --> 01:53.526
like a squirrelicorn.

01:53.526 --> 01:55.196
- Globgore!

01:55.196 --> 01:57.156
Globgore, globgore.

01:57.156 --> 01:58.736
Oh!

01:58.736 --> 02:01.356
How did you do that,
and teach it to me now.

02:03.316 --> 02:04.736
He just looked like
he needed a little
head scratch.

02:04.736 --> 02:06.696
Globgore.

02:06.696 --> 02:08.356
You know,
once in a while,

02:08.356 --> 02:10.856
you've got to slow down
and appreciate the feeling

02:10.856 --> 02:12.276
of a nice head scratch,

02:12.276 --> 02:14.526
or the smell of
a freshly bloomed rose,

02:14.526 --> 02:16.946
or the taste of
a delicious candy bar.

02:20.946 --> 02:22.816
I might have
some self-control issues.

02:24.816 --> 02:26.026
Yeah, me, too.

02:26.026 --> 02:28.776
You seem so familiar.
We met before, right?

02:28.776 --> 02:31.946
Maybe. I used to visit
this garden a lot.

02:31.946 --> 02:34.236
Oh, have you been to
the Rose Tower?

02:34.236 --> 02:36.816
The view of the garden
is absolutely divine.

02:36.816 --> 02:38.196
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:38.196 --> 02:39.946
That's been condemned
for forever.

02:39.946 --> 02:42.856
Well, don't let
that stop you.

02:44.566 --> 02:46.816
Hey, if you're
around tonight,

02:46.816 --> 02:48.156
you should come to
the royal dinner.

02:48.156 --> 02:50.446
Oh, that sounds
delightful.

02:50.446 --> 02:51.986
But I may have
other plans.

02:51.986 --> 02:53.856
Aw. You got
a hot date?

02:53.856 --> 02:55.856
Something like that.

02:57.026 --> 02:58.856
- Star!
- Mom!

03:00.986 --> 03:03.396
Omnitraxis!

03:03.396 --> 03:06.106
Star, are you okay?
Did she hurt you?

03:06.106 --> 03:07.946
What? No.
No one hurt me.

03:07.946 --> 03:09.526
I was just talking
to that nice lady.

03:09.526 --> 03:12.856
Nice lady?
Star, that's Eclypsa.

03:12.856 --> 03:14.606
Long time,
no speak, Moon.

03:14.606 --> 03:16.816
How did that spell
work for you?

03:16.816 --> 03:19.396
Not another word
out of you, Eclypsa.

03:19.396 --> 03:21.896
That's Eclypsa?

03:21.896 --> 03:24.486
We need to
decontaminate you.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.986
- Look into
the light, please.

03:26.986 --> 03:30.276
- Uh, to check for
spots of evil.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.316
Well, there's no telling
what Eclypsa might have
done to you.

03:32.316 --> 03:35.066
Stop it. I am telling you,
Eclypsa didn't do
anything to me.

03:35.066 --> 03:36.486
I am fine.

03:39.446 --> 03:41.066
What are you... hey!

03:41.066 --> 03:42.816
Cover your left eye
with the paddle,

03:42.816 --> 03:44.066
and read the lines
as best you can.

03:44.066 --> 03:47.486
I-A-M-E-V-I...

03:47.486 --> 03:49.396
No, you don't.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.896
That just spells
"I am evil."

03:50.896 --> 03:53.196
That was, like,
totally an admission.

03:53.196 --> 03:54.856
What? No, this is rigged.

03:54.856 --> 03:56.026
I was reading the thing.

03:56.026 --> 03:56.856
Skin check.
Oh, dear.

03:56.856 --> 03:58.486
You always had this mole?

03:58.486 --> 04:01.236
Yes, but it doesn't
make me evil.

04:01.236 --> 04:02.696
Just a little
self-conscious sometimes.

04:02.696 --> 04:04.606
And why is there
a monkey?

04:04.606 --> 04:06.316
- To check for evil fleas.

04:06.316 --> 04:07.816
- He found something.

04:09.856 --> 04:12.856
- Never mind. He says
they're just regular fleas.
- I knew that.

04:12.856 --> 04:14.986
Stand here,
arms down.

04:14.986 --> 04:17.276
- One moment.
- Hey!

04:17.276 --> 04:19.106
Do you even know
what you're doing?

04:19.106 --> 04:21.106
No, but we still
gotta do a test.

04:21.106 --> 04:23.106
Are you evil?

04:23.106 --> 04:24.156
No!

04:25.816 --> 04:27.526
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:27.526 --> 04:30.196
Are you evil, are you
evil, are you evil?

04:30.196 --> 04:32.156
- I am fine.

04:32.156 --> 04:34.396
I talked to Eclypsa for,
like, two seconds,

04:34.396 --> 04:36.736
and she was
really nice.
No big deal.

04:36.736 --> 04:38.606
It could be
a very big deal.

04:38.606 --> 04:40.396
Okay, fine, but why?

04:40.396 --> 04:42.526
Star, she betrayed
her kingdom.

04:42.526 --> 04:45.566
She abandoned her people
so she could run off
with a monster.

04:45.566 --> 04:47.696
Mm-hmm, yes, right.
I knew that.

04:47.696 --> 04:49.776
Kinda selfish.
Okay, then what?
She blew everything up?

04:49.776 --> 04:53.106
No. They crystallized her
before she had the chance.

04:53.106 --> 04:56.736
Wait, you crystallized her
for being in love?

04:56.736 --> 04:58.736
To a monster.

04:58.736 --> 05:00.156
And that's not all.

05:00.156 --> 05:02.396
She didn't respect
the natural order.

05:02.396 --> 05:05.356
She meddled in the dark arts,
and created her own chapter

05:05.356 --> 05:07.106
of dangerous evil magic.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.606
Have you ever even read it?

05:08.606 --> 05:11.026
Of course not.

05:11.026 --> 05:13.196
Well, I have, and it really
wasn't that big of a deal.

05:13.196 --> 05:16.896
Ugh. Chime in
any time, guys.
You knew her, too.

05:16.896 --> 05:19.106
Uh, I mean, I saw her
double-dipping in the ranch

05:19.106 --> 05:20.356
at the royal ball once.

05:20.356 --> 05:22.986
She told me she thought
Rhombulus was annoying.

05:22.986 --> 05:25.446
- Yes.

05:25.446 --> 05:28.356
Oh, yeah? She totally
used to eat babies.

05:28.356 --> 05:30.736
Nope, nope,
that wasn't Eclypsa.

05:30.736 --> 05:32.986
That was Bobipsa,
the barbarian baby eater.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.446
Are you calling
me a liar?

05:34.446 --> 05:36.526
I'm pretty sure Eclypsa
was a pescaterian.

05:36.526 --> 05:38.526
Okay, guys,
as fascinating

05:38.526 --> 05:41.066
and fact-filled
as this conversation is,

05:41.066 --> 05:43.606
I'm feeling kinda done.

05:43.606 --> 05:45.236
The tests say I'm fine.

05:45.236 --> 05:47.986
Star, please, these tests
are for your own good.

05:47.986 --> 05:50.776
Ugh! I am good.

05:50.776 --> 05:54.106
It sounds like Eclypsa didn't
deserve to be crystallized.

05:54.106 --> 05:56.196
I mean, what's next,
you gonna crystallize me

05:56.196 --> 05:58.156
if I do something
you don't approve of?

05:58.156 --> 06:00.066
Give us the room.

06:05.026 --> 06:07.606
When I first
met Eclypsa,

06:07.606 --> 06:08.986
I trusted her, too.

06:08.986 --> 06:10.986
I didn't know
any better.

06:10.986 --> 06:13.356
Truthfully, Star,
you're very capable
for your age, but--

06:13.356 --> 06:15.236
Then why won't
anyone listen to me?

06:15.236 --> 06:17.156
It's complicated.

06:17.156 --> 06:19.066
Eclypsa can
be very...

06:19.066 --> 06:20.986
convincing.

06:20.986 --> 06:24.156
For your safety,
let me handle this.

06:24.156 --> 06:26.106
So what are you gonna do?

06:26.106 --> 06:29.656
I'm afraid the only
option is immediate
re-crystallization.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.236
What? No. No, no, no, no.

06:31.236 --> 06:33.026
That's so harsh.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.696
- You can't just go--
- This isn't a debate, Star.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.236
I gave my orders to
the Magic High Commission,

06:38.236 --> 06:40.066
and they're on their way
to her cell as we speak.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.816
She's to be re-crystallized
immediately.

06:42.816 --> 06:45.606
Oh, we'll see about that.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.896
Oh, Globgore!

06:47.896 --> 06:49.196
My wand!

06:49.196 --> 06:51.066
Locked! Glossaryck.

06:53.106 --> 06:55.106
- Glossaryck!

06:55.106 --> 06:57.696
Glossaryck, the wand.

06:57.696 --> 06:59.156
Globgore?

07:02.066 --> 07:04.236
Wand.

07:04.236 --> 07:06.816
Globgore!

07:08.236 --> 07:10.106
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

07:11.896 --> 07:13.606
Globgore.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.816
No, Glossaryck.
We have to save Eclypsa.

07:17.856 --> 07:19.106
Globgore.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.986
Gotcha.

07:24.986 --> 07:25.986
Super sparkle cloudy.

07:30.856 --> 07:32.156
Wheeeee!

07:36.196 --> 07:38.106
I'm gonna enjoy this.

07:38.106 --> 07:39.896
Rhombulus, no, wait!

07:42.446 --> 07:43.896
Turn it off!

07:48.156 --> 07:50.566
Great. Now I got crystals
growing outta my...

07:50.566 --> 07:53.486
Oh, Star, you caused
quite the ruckus.

07:53.486 --> 07:55.736
Will you all just
listen to me for one second?

07:55.736 --> 07:58.776
Crystallizing people
is a serious punishment,

07:58.776 --> 08:01.316
and so far, no one
has been able to convince me

08:01.316 --> 08:02.946
that Eclypsa deserves it.

08:02.946 --> 08:04.856
Star, I know Eclypsa
seems nice,

08:04.856 --> 08:07.066
but she can get into your head
and make you do things

08:07.066 --> 08:09.066
you don't want to do.

08:09.066 --> 08:10.946
Oh, my goodness,
you're right.

08:10.946 --> 08:12.316
Giving you that spell
to destroy Toffee

08:12.316 --> 08:14.106
was her idea.

08:14.106 --> 08:16.106
Oh, no, wait.
You were the one

08:16.106 --> 08:17.736
who went to her
for help.

08:17.736 --> 08:19.066
Yes, but...

08:19.066 --> 08:20.316
And you made
a deal with her.

08:20.316 --> 08:23.446
If Toffee was destroyed,
she'd be set free.

08:23.446 --> 08:25.946
Well, hey,
Toffee's gone,

08:25.946 --> 08:27.986
and you wanna go back
on your word?

08:27.986 --> 08:30.276
But Star, look what
her spell did to me.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.776
When I performed
that spell,

08:32.776 --> 08:34.276
I could feel the darkness.

08:34.276 --> 08:36.316
Eclypsa is
evil, Star.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.156
I know you don't
believe it now,

08:38.156 --> 08:39.856
but if you wait
to find out the truth

08:39.856 --> 08:41.396
for yourself,
it'll be too late.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.276
Okay, fine. If she is
as bad as you say she is,

08:44.276 --> 08:46.026
then put her in a crystal.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.356
But she at least deserves
to have a fair trial.

08:48.356 --> 08:49.736
Oh, for goodness sake, fine.

08:49.736 --> 08:51.026
We'll have a trial.

08:51.026 --> 08:54.356
Yes!
Due process, due process.

08:54.356 --> 08:57.276
but I'm only allowing this
because I want there to be

08:57.276 --> 08:59.026
no doubt amongst anyone
in Mewni--

08:59.026 --> 09:00.736
I'm looking at you, Star--

09:00.736 --> 09:03.026
that Eclypsa is evil
and deserves her fate.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.526
See, Eclypsa?

09:04.526 --> 09:06.276
Around here, we believe in
a little thing called

09:06.276 --> 09:09.156
the justice system.
Hey, where are you going?

09:09.156 --> 09:10.446
It's going to take
a little time

09:10.446 --> 09:12.026
to get the trial
all set up.

09:12.026 --> 09:14.236
You can't just leave her
chained up

09:14.236 --> 09:16.656
in this dark
and smelly dungeon.

09:16.656 --> 09:20.736
You know, I always did
enjoy gazing at the roses.

09:24.566 --> 09:26.566
Oh, hello,
Princess Butterfly.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.316
Stand aside.

09:39.236 --> 09:42.696
- Eclypsa.
- Star. I was hoping--
- Don't move.

09:42.696 --> 09:44.196
I want some answers.

09:44.196 --> 09:47.316
Did you or did you not
mess with dark magic?

09:47.316 --> 09:50.816
Well... I did
what I had to do for me.

09:50.816 --> 09:52.776
If the Magic High Commission
and your mother

09:52.776 --> 09:55.816
think that's evil,
call me a villainess.

09:57.156 --> 09:59.316
Wait. Are you in my mind?

09:59.316 --> 10:01.656
They said you could be
in my mind, and I
wouldn't even know.

10:01.656 --> 10:03.736
Definitely not.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.396
But if I were,
I wouldn't tell you.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.396
That's a joke.

10:07.396 --> 10:09.356
Oh, it wasn't
very funny.

10:09.356 --> 10:11.316
- But that's okay, 'cause...
- Globgore.

10:11.316 --> 10:13.606
Globgore!

10:13.606 --> 10:16.446
- Glossaryck!
Good to see you.
- Globgore!

10:16.446 --> 10:19.356
He's, uh, he's been
kind of a handful lately.

10:19.356 --> 10:23.486
Could you maybe do that
crystal

10:23.486 --> 10:25.486
- Sure.
- Globgore, globgore.

10:25.486 --> 10:27.816

I just want you to be
treated fairly.

10:45.736 --> 10:48.396

you know, before.

10:57.696 --> 10:59.396

But the most important
thing's still the same.

11:06.026 --> 11:07.856
Wow!

11:09.486 --> 11:11.696
