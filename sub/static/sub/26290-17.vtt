WEBVTT

00:09.445 --> 00:11.845
You look nice.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.210
Are you having dinner with us?

00:13.250 --> 00:15.075
No, I'm meeting Bella in the city.

00:15.100 --> 00:18.268
She got reservations to a
trendy new place in Soho.

00:18.293 --> 00:20.350
Okay.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

00:32.734 --> 00:33.864
You look fancy.

00:33.914 --> 00:36.524
But you missed a
couple of buttons there.

00:36.564 --> 00:39.134
- Where you going?
- Girls' night.

00:39.174 --> 00:42.094
Oh, but no drinking, right?

00:44.134 --> 00:47.624
Love you.

00:49.534 --> 00:51.294
What... what...

00:51.324 --> 00:53.404
What's happening to me?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.839
What is... I... I can't move.

00:55.864 --> 00:57.164
I can't...

01:07.074 --> 01:11.424
You look so pretty...

01:11.474 --> 01:14.864
and so sexy.

01:14.904 --> 01:16.914
I can't wait...

01:16.954 --> 01:19.084
to see you die.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.484
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:30.754 --> 01:32.444
- You Bell and Zidan?
- Yeah.

01:32.494 --> 01:34.844
Detective Tom Shay, Major Case Unit.

01:34.884 --> 01:36.754
Getting a lot of heat on this.

01:36.804 --> 01:39.934
Brass wants answers, I
don't know what to tell them.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.284
This is the third young
woman we've found like this

01:42.324 --> 01:44.979
with her face made up.

01:45.004 --> 01:49.094
Are you saying we have a
serial killer out there?

01:49.119 --> 01:50.599
Name's Chrissy Bugasi.

01:51.074 --> 01:52.514
Turned 20 three days ago.

01:52.554 --> 01:56.124
Lived with her parents in Mount Vernon.

01:56.164 --> 01:57.904
What about the other two victims?

01:57.954 --> 01:59.514
Lauren Eustace, 22.

01:59.564 --> 02:01.524
Found her in Riverside
Park eight weeks ago.

02:01.564 --> 02:04.044
Then we have Chloe Mark, 19.

02:04.084 --> 02:06.564
We found her in Inwood
Park three weeks ago.

02:06.614 --> 02:07.744
And now this.

02:07.784 --> 02:09.394
What about physical appearance?

02:09.443 --> 02:10.614
All pretty similar.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.884
Young, attractive, brunette.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.704
Same build.

02:14.754 --> 02:17.844
And when we found them
they looked just like that.

02:21.144 --> 02:23.974
So since it's a serial,
you guys can take the lead.

02:24.024 --> 02:25.817
- If you want it.
- We'll take it.

02:25.842 --> 02:29.414
Great, I'll get the evidence
transferred to your lab ASAP.

02:31.139 --> 02:32.757
Uh, excuse me?

02:32.782 --> 02:35.204
Take some photos of the
looky-loos, but be discreet.

02:35.254 --> 02:36.400
Don't let them know you're doing it.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.904
- Sure.
- Thanks.

02:37.944 --> 02:39.474
What are you doing?

02:39.514 --> 02:41.564
Serials tend to return
to the scene to watch.

02:41.604 --> 02:43.344
No, I'm talking about taking the lead

02:43.384 --> 02:45.914
without talking to Dana first.

02:48.004 --> 02:50.704
I'm sorry I didn't
run this by you first,

02:50.744 --> 02:53.094
but this monster raped,

02:53.134 --> 02:56.014
strangled, and then
posed three young women.

02:56.054 --> 02:59.844
He is smart, he's
organized, and he's evil.

02:59.884 --> 03:03.234
Worse, he's escalating.

03:03.274 --> 03:04.990
Do you have any idea
how much of our budget

03:05.014 --> 03:08.454
you've just committed to this case?

03:08.504 --> 03:09.714
No.

03:09.764 --> 03:12.464
Neither do I. That's the problem.

03:12.504 --> 03:15.554
I don't know any SAC who
wouldn't have you suspended.

03:21.774 --> 03:24.164
But I trust you.

03:24.214 --> 03:27.384
I trust your judgment.

03:27.434 --> 03:29.134
So when you say he's escalating,

03:29.174 --> 03:31.134
what do you mean?

03:31.174 --> 03:33.964
His cooling-off period after
his first kill was five weeks.

03:34.004 --> 03:35.704
His second kill was three weeks.

03:35.744 --> 03:38.004
I mean, the clock is shrinking.

03:38.054 --> 03:41.224
So he's gonna kill again soon.

03:41.274 --> 03:44.584
Let's get to work.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.934
And, Maggie...

03:46.974 --> 03:49.324
If you ask for the ball,

03:49.364 --> 03:51.414
better make the shot.

03:53.504 --> 03:55.544
All right, first up on the docket,

03:55.594 --> 03:57.374
a serial killer hungry for prey.

03:57.414 --> 03:59.374
Three dead bodies thus far.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.294
We're looking for a
nexus among the victims.

04:01.334 --> 04:04.074
We know he has a physical type,
but did they know each other?

04:04.099 --> 04:05.336
Are they connected in some way,

04:05.360 --> 04:07.140
or is he an
equal-opportunity executioner

04:07.165 --> 04:08.995
stalking and killing without prejudice?

04:09.084 --> 04:10.254
Let's work, people.

04:10.304 --> 04:12.474
Given the sophistication
of these crimes...

04:12.524 --> 04:14.954
the elaborate production,
posing... the chance that

04:15.004 --> 04:17.766
these three victims are the
only ones is slim to none.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.750
I agree. Hey, we need to run the
MO and victimology through VICAP.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.310
Already did that. There are no hits.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.676
Run it again and don't
use makeup or posing.

04:24.701 --> 04:27.455
Did that, too. We came up with
1,250 hits on that search.

04:28.490 --> 04:31.057
It's obviously too
broad. We need more data.

04:31.082 --> 04:34.670
Okay, so good news is ERT
found Chrissy Bugasi's cell.

04:34.695 --> 04:36.980
It was tossed in the bushes about
a 100 yards from the crime scene.

04:36.988 --> 04:38.298
- Ian will have it soon.
- Great.

04:38.338 --> 04:40.305
Bad news is, uh, Deputy Mayor Carver

04:40.330 --> 04:42.363
is waiting for you in your office.

04:42.388 --> 04:44.738
Good luck.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.129
Lynn, good to see you.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.504
You should have called.

04:48.529 --> 04:49.699
I met with the mayor.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.148
He's very concerned
about this serial case.

04:52.188 --> 04:54.588
We are, too.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.456
Specifically, he's concerned
with the flow of information.

04:57.481 --> 04:58.518
I understand.

04:58.543 --> 05:02.373
I'll make sure your office
gets updates regularly.

05:02.848 --> 05:05.338
I know you've worked
serial cases before,

05:05.378 --> 05:08.158
but not here. It's different.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.818
This is the media capital of the world,

05:10.858 --> 05:13.298
and the New York media can't
get enough of these stories.

05:13.338 --> 05:15.648
They like to turn these
horrific murders into theater,

05:15.688 --> 05:17.958
into entertainment.

05:17.998 --> 05:19.648
I get it.

05:19.698 --> 05:22.528
I'll do my best to control the message.

05:24.438 --> 05:26.698
Great, I appreciate it.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.318
Cause of death was
ligature strangulation,

05:35.368 --> 05:36.978
same as the other two victims.

05:37.018 --> 05:40.538
Damage to the hyoid bones
indicates extreme pressure.

05:42.628 --> 05:44.768
This section of the
ligature mark is darker.

05:44.808 --> 05:46.224
Good eye, that's caused by the pinching

05:46.248 --> 05:47.898
of a retracting ligature.

05:47.938 --> 05:50.378
"Retracting." Like
a... like a pole snare?

05:50.418 --> 05:52.208
Animal snares use cable.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.118
This was flat.

05:59.168 --> 06:00.828
She doesn't have any defensive wounds.

06:00.868 --> 06:03.180
And none of the typical
trauma of a sexual assault,

06:03.205 --> 06:04.828
just like the others.

06:04.868 --> 06:07.308
He drugs them, doesn't he?

06:07.348 --> 06:09.528
Chrissy tested positive for Vecuronium.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.838
It's medically available.
Used in surgery.

06:11.878 --> 06:13.448
There was no mention of Vecuronium

06:13.488 --> 06:14.965
in the prior victims' lab results.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.229
It's nearly undetectable
in the body after six hours,

06:17.254 --> 06:19.316
but once I found it in
Chrissy I went back and tested

06:19.340 --> 06:20.647
the other two for trace amounts.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.848
- Mm-hmm.
- Both were positive.

06:22.888 --> 06:25.108
Well, at least they were unconscious

06:25.148 --> 06:26.628
- for the worst part.
- Yeah.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.978
Unfortunately, no.
Vecuronium isn't a sedative.

06:29.028 --> 06:30.118
It's a paralytic.

06:30.158 --> 06:31.378
They were paralyzed

06:31.418 --> 06:33.468
but fully conscious
of what was going on.

06:35.948 --> 06:37.988
Ready?

06:43.478 --> 06:47.608
I see the stories on TV
about all the awful things

06:47.658 --> 06:50.008
that can happen to young people,

06:50.048 --> 06:51.528
and I'd thank the Lord

06:51.568 --> 06:54.008
that nothing like that
ever happened to our family.

06:54.048 --> 06:56.268
And now it's happened to us.

06:56.318 --> 06:58.668
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

06:58.708 --> 07:01.358
We do need to ask some questions.

07:01.408 --> 07:03.124
Can you tell me about
Chrissy's social life?

07:03.148 --> 07:05.848
- Was she dating anyone?
- She didn't date.

07:05.888 --> 07:07.198
Chrissy was 20 years old.

07:07.238 --> 07:08.678
If you're implying that

07:08.718 --> 07:10.134
my daughter brought this upon herself...

07:10.158 --> 07:12.068
They're not, Louis.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.184
Do you know why Chrissy
went into the city

07:17.208 --> 07:19.118
the night she disappeared?

07:19.168 --> 07:21.428
She was having dinner with a girlfriend

07:21.468 --> 07:24.388
at some fancy restaurant in Soho.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.958
Um, she wasn't in Soho last night.

07:29.998 --> 07:31.528
How do you know?

07:31.568 --> 07:34.308
We retrieved her phone, and
based on the radio signals,

07:34.348 --> 07:36.568
it appears she was never
south of 14th Street.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.008
Are you saying she lied to us?

07:41.058 --> 07:43.578
Yes, uh, I'm afraid I am.

07:46.018 --> 07:47.978
Was there anyone in Chrissy's life

07:48.018 --> 07:51.198
who concerned you or her?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.758
A few months back,
she... she ran into a boy

07:53.808 --> 07:55.418
she... she went to grade school with.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.198
They became friends,

07:57.248 --> 08:00.678
but, he, um, developed feelings for her.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.858
She tried to let him down gently,

08:02.898 --> 08:04.688
but it went badly.

08:04.728 --> 08:06.948
He made threats,

08:06.998 --> 08:08.648
so she broke off their friendship.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.168
When was that?

08:10.218 --> 08:11.868
Last week.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.228
Do you have a name for this guy?

08:13.258 --> 08:14.998
Tim Shaughnessy.

08:15.048 --> 08:18.568
She said he worked for
the Parks Department.

08:20.788 --> 08:22.178
Why would I hurt Chrissy?

08:22.228 --> 08:23.398
I wanted to date her.

08:23.448 --> 08:24.748
'Cause she blew you off?

08:24.798 --> 08:27.098
Yeah, well, most girls blow me off.

08:27.148 --> 08:29.058
Then why were you threatening her?

08:29.098 --> 08:32.018
I wasn't threatening her.
I was being persistent.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.587
I liked her, you know?

08:33.628 --> 08:35.323
But she kept telling me
that she wasn't allowed

08:35.347 --> 08:37.898
to date people that
didn't go to her church.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.248
And then I found out

08:39.288 --> 08:41.248
that she was using some dating app,

08:41.288 --> 08:42.744
hanging out with all
these dudes from the city,

08:42.768 --> 08:45.638
so I got upset.

08:45.688 --> 08:47.558
Look, I don't know what
she's been telling you,

08:47.598 --> 08:50.998
but whatever it is, I didn't do it.

08:51.038 --> 08:53.908
She was found dead this morning.

08:58.258 --> 09:00.528
Uh...

09:00.568 --> 09:02.008
I... I can't believe it.

09:02.048 --> 09:05.618
Do you know someone by
the name of Lauren Eustace?

09:05.658 --> 09:06.918
No.

09:06.968 --> 09:10.488
What about a Chloe Mark?

09:10.538 --> 09:12.968
Where were you last night?

09:17.328 --> 09:19.108
You think I killed her?

09:19.148 --> 09:21.938
Are you insane?

09:23.768 --> 09:27.508
Um, I was shooting pool

09:27.533 --> 09:29.103
at a place on 24th.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.468
The Pearl.

09:30.508 --> 09:31.908
I... I left at 3:00 a.m.

09:31.948 --> 09:34.388
Then where'd you go?

09:34.428 --> 09:36.078
Home.

09:36.128 --> 09:37.934
I... I share an apartment
with three friends in Brooklyn.

09:37.958 --> 09:41.738
I... I'm sure the building
has lots of video cameras.

09:41.788 --> 09:43.568
We'll be sure to check.

09:43.608 --> 09:45.438
You said that she was
on some dating app.

09:45.488 --> 09:48.708
What was the name of it?

09:48.748 --> 09:50.228
Hey, Jubal.

09:50.268 --> 09:52.463
Hey, uh, Pearl confirmed his alibi.

09:52.488 --> 09:53.798
He was there till 3:00 a.m.

09:53.838 --> 09:55.758
And we have video of him
entering his apartment

09:55.798 --> 09:57.668
at 3:27 a.m.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.588
Did you find the dating app? ApplePie?

09:59.628 --> 10:02.678
Uh, for wholesome,
All-American next-door types?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.945
Yeah, I found it.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.880
It was, uh, hidden
in her utilities icon.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.362
I went back and I checked
the other victims' cellphones,

10:08.386 --> 10:09.996
and they were both on ApplePie, too.

10:10.021 --> 10:11.981
That could be the
connection we're looking for.

10:12.006 --> 10:13.226
Yep.

10:13.251 --> 10:14.408
Can you dig into Chrissy's account?

10:14.432 --> 10:15.574
See who she was communicating with?

10:15.598 --> 10:17.146
I can't get past her profile page.

10:17.171 --> 10:19.053
This app uses closed source encryption.

10:19.078 --> 10:21.088
Without the encryption
key, it'll take time.

10:21.128 --> 10:22.454
Well, then you'd better get to it.

10:22.478 --> 10:25.782
What do we know about
this ApplePie dating app?

10:25.807 --> 10:28.331
Well, aside from the privacy
and security features,

10:28.398 --> 10:31.398
the only thing unique about
it is the personality survey.

10:31.438 --> 10:32.748
Really? Isn't that standard?

10:32.788 --> 10:34.398
Well, surveys are standard,

10:34.448 --> 10:37.148
but accessibility to
other users' answers isn't.

10:37.188 --> 10:38.684
And you just know this
off the top of your head?

10:38.708 --> 10:41.628
Don't judge me.

10:41.668 --> 10:43.408
"How would your family react

10:43.458 --> 10:45.848
if they found out you
were using ApplePie"?

10:45.873 --> 10:49.223
Chrissy answered D, "They
must never learn of this."

10:52.117 --> 10:54.858
Pull up the other victims' surveys.

10:54.898 --> 10:56.508
Okay.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.038
They all answered D.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.558
Makes sense.

11:03.608 --> 11:05.698
These families are all
religious conservatives,

11:05.738 --> 11:08.128
so the killer knew the women
wouldn't share information

11:08.178 --> 11:10.223
- or talk about the date.
- Hmm.

11:10.248 --> 11:12.394
Okay, let's cross-reference
"unsolved homicides"...

11:14.968 --> 11:18.838
"Strict religious families,"
"internet dating"...

11:18.878 --> 11:20.228
"and ApplePie."

11:34.118 --> 11:35.728
We don't just have three victims.

11:35.768 --> 11:38.548
We have ten.

11:47.688 --> 11:50.275
All ten victims were
in their 20s, brunette.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.660
They came from religious families.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.260
They used the ApplePie dating app.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.610
They met someone in
Manhattan for a date,

11:55.635 --> 11:58.520
and they were strangled
shortly thereafter.

11:58.545 --> 12:00.815
Were the others made
up and posed as well?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.361
No, just the last three.

12:02.386 --> 12:05.826
So his signature's
evolving. That's unusual.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.020
And the dump sites are moving
closer and closer to Manhattan.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.537
The first victim was
dumped 87 miles away,

12:11.562 --> 12:15.135
the next was 73, and the
one after that was 55.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.720
At first, serial killers
are hyper-vigilant.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.176
They don't want to implicate themselves.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.640
And with each kill, they
become more confident

12:21.680 --> 12:22.990
and less vigilant,

12:23.015 --> 12:25.625
and they begin to drop
bodies closer to home.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.367
Which is why the last
three are more elaborate.

12:27.391 --> 12:30.679
This guy's feeling more
and more invulnerable.

12:30.704 --> 12:31.868
Okay, so we just got the files back

12:31.892 --> 12:33.152
- from the dating site?
- Yeah?

12:33.177 --> 12:35.065
Founder used a lot of
encryption software,

12:35.090 --> 12:37.130
but, uh, once we got
past it, we found out

12:37.155 --> 12:39.065
that all inter-client communications

12:39.090 --> 12:41.610
are automatically deleted
once the user logs out.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.115
Technically, they're unrecoverable.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.741
But luckily, we are the FBI

12:46.766 --> 12:50.540
and nothing is unrecoverable, right?

12:53.670 --> 12:55.020
What is it?

12:55.060 --> 12:56.523
Mayor's office doesn't want to go public

12:56.547 --> 12:58.057
with seven new victims.

12:58.082 --> 12:59.085
and I quote,

12:59.110 --> 13:01.695
"Without more evidence,
we think it's reckless

13:01.720 --> 13:03.600
"to tell the public
that a single individual

13:03.640 --> 13:05.510
"is responsible for all ten murders.

13:05.550 --> 13:09.164
ADIC Fritz and the
Deputy Director concur."

13:09.189 --> 13:11.016
Guess I'm gonna have to
rewrite my press comments.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.120
Sorry, what?

13:15.300 --> 13:17.570
Dana's the SAC. We're the FBI.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.700
- Don't we make the calls?
- No, not that simple.

13:20.740 --> 13:22.660
Mayor of New York has a lot of power,

13:22.700 --> 13:24.790
a lot of important friends in D.C.,

13:24.830 --> 13:28.530
including the director of the FBI.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.540
Like it or not, we
have to work together.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.410
Yes, I can confirm that this morning

13:40.460 --> 13:43.460
the NYPD requested FBI
forensics assistance

13:43.500 --> 13:46.160
on several unsolved homicides.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
As these are ongoing investigations,

13:48.250 --> 13:50.470
the Bureau cannot make
a comment at this time.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.030
- Thank you.
- Dana's good.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.626
She's being handcuffed
by the Mayor's office

13:53.650 --> 13:54.780
and the boys in D.C.

13:54.820 --> 13:57.040
- She has no choice.
- Okay.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.520
Looks like the three
victims found in Manhattan

13:59.560 --> 14:01.570
were contacted by the same person.

14:01.610 --> 14:03.520
But who he is or what they said,

14:03.570 --> 14:04.570
that'll take more time.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.675
It's Dana.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.376
The killer just sent a
letter to the "New York Post."

14:09.400 --> 14:11.880
She wants to meet in
the conference room now.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.490
"I am the Apex and I am here."

14:14.540 --> 14:17.150
"Through bridge and tunnel,
I play with objects I love

14:17.190 --> 14:19.500
and make them smile."

14:19.540 --> 14:21.600
This is a bunch of
narcissistic nonsense.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.497
It is, but publishing it
might increase our chances

14:24.522 --> 14:26.070
of finding him.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.900
Someone might recognize
the language or the content

14:28.940 --> 14:30.380
and contact us.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.250
It's how we caught the Unabomber.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.380
I get it, but we're not gonna
give this idiot more publicity.

14:36.430 --> 14:39.340
What if the publicity
helps us get a new lead?

14:41.210 --> 14:44.300
Since the news of the
three strangled girls broke,

14:44.325 --> 14:47.998
there's been an 18% spike
in hotel cancellations.

14:48.023 --> 14:50.593
There is no need to
add fuel to the fire.

14:52.647 --> 14:54.647
With all due respect,
that's not our concern.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.230
It's tourist season.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.140
People come here to go to the Met,

14:58.190 --> 15:00.540
see "Hamilton," walk
through Central Park.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.761
Not worry about getting
murdered by a maniac

15:02.786 --> 15:04.840
hunting down young brunettes.

15:04.865 --> 15:07.460
Agreed, so isn't it
better to find the killer?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.418
Stop him from doing this?

15:09.443 --> 15:10.900
I'll be happy to call the Mayor

15:10.940 --> 15:12.826
and explain the merits
of publishing this letter.

15:12.850 --> 15:15.380
There's no need. We're not publishing.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.340
The Mayor has spoken
to the Deputy Director.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.860
They've already made their decision.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.340
Then why the hell did you
bother to come down here?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.260
I'm just trying to be polite.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.000
Really?

15:29.700 --> 15:32.440
Let me tell you something,
it is not always that simple.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.010
So if you would excuse us,
we need to get back to work

15:35.050 --> 15:36.570
to find this damn serial killer.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.710
Not because it is hurting
the city's occupancy rates,

15:39.750 --> 15:43.020
but because he is
killing innocent women.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.208
Where were we?

15:54.904 --> 15:57.694
"I play with objects I
love and make them smile.

15:57.734 --> 16:01.425
"With shadow and light, I
expose your source of terror.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.818
You cannot stop me.
This is my birthright."

16:03.843 --> 16:05.582
The "smile" makeup application

16:05.607 --> 16:07.764
wasn't released to the press,
so it's gotta be him, right?

16:07.788 --> 16:10.222
Grammar, punctuation, syntax indicate

16:10.247 --> 16:12.465
that he's an educated
white male trying hard

16:12.490 --> 16:14.051
to sound even more educated.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.098
When the press starts writing about him,

16:16.138 --> 16:17.424
he wants to be called the Apex Killer...

16:17.448 --> 16:19.278
probably 'cause he thinks it's cool.

16:19.318 --> 16:20.668
That's why he wrote the letter.

16:20.708 --> 16:23.238
And some of these phrases are not his.

16:23.278 --> 16:25.548
"Play with objects I
love," "source of terror,"

16:25.588 --> 16:27.498
they're Carl Jung.

16:27.548 --> 16:29.718
The son of a bitch
picks his victims wisely.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.458
He knew all ten girls
wouldn't talk about

16:31.508 --> 16:33.548
their little walk on the wild side

16:33.573 --> 16:34.848
with their families.

16:34.873 --> 16:37.443
Can't believe going on a date
is a walk on the wild side.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.788
The Apex profile we worked up.

16:51.828 --> 16:53.438
I want you to distribute it

16:53.488 --> 16:55.838
to all the law enforcement agencies

16:55.878 --> 16:57.048
in the tri-state area.

16:57.098 --> 16:58.504
I like where you're going with this.

16:58.528 --> 17:00.538
But if we go wide with this information,

17:00.578 --> 17:02.098
somebody is going to leak it.

17:02.148 --> 17:04.578
Exactly, and when they do
the "Post" will go to press

17:04.603 --> 17:06.603
with the letter before
someone scoops them.

17:06.667 --> 17:07.978
Nice.

17:08.018 --> 17:10.678
In the meantime, let's
dig into evidence we have

17:10.718 --> 17:13.458
- and see what we can act on.
- Got it.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.068
Hey, guys?

17:17.117 --> 17:19.028
I think I found something.

17:19.053 --> 17:21.828
'Kay.

17:21.853 --> 17:23.893
These are Chrissy Bugasi's
crime scene photos.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.738
NYPD crime scene photos from this year.

17:27.778 --> 17:31.478
What do you see?

17:31.518 --> 17:35.658
The Apex's photos...
content notwithstanding...

17:35.683 --> 17:38.033
are prettier.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.098
Mm-hmm.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.398
Nine more random crime scene photos,

17:41.448 --> 17:45.448
all taken from different agencies.

17:45.488 --> 17:47.318
Wow.

17:47.368 --> 17:50.758
Yeah, the Apex photos are
definitely more composed.

17:50.798 --> 17:54.678
He selects the location
and time based on light.

17:54.718 --> 17:56.004
He selects the girls based on looks.

17:56.028 --> 17:58.508
He poses them. He puts makeup on them.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.858
He's acting like a photographer.

18:00.898 --> 18:02.886
We just got a response
to the Apex profile.

18:02.911 --> 18:05.197
Jersey cop saw the profile,
called in a suspect.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.533
Edward Praeger. He's a plastic surgeon.

18:07.558 --> 18:09.448
He was accused of
drugging and assaulting

18:09.473 --> 18:10.558
young brunette women.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.736
A surgeon would definitely
have access to Vecuronium.

18:12.761 --> 18:13.769
- Mm-hmm.
- Exactly.

18:13.794 --> 18:15.973
Oh, the father of one of
the victims, Jim Eustace,

18:15.998 --> 18:18.207
is in the conference room.
He wants to talk to one of you two.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.711
I'll take it.

18:21.878 --> 18:23.398
Mr. Eustace.

18:23.448 --> 18:25.618
- I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.
- I called the NYPD.

18:25.668 --> 18:26.928
They gave me the runaround,

18:26.968 --> 18:28.768
told me they weren't
working the case anymore.

18:28.798 --> 18:30.538
Right, we've taken the lead.

18:30.578 --> 18:32.474
And you don't tell anyone?
You don't reach out?

18:32.498 --> 18:35.108
I'm sorry, somebody
should have called you

18:35.148 --> 18:36.304
and let you know what was going on.

18:36.328 --> 18:39.028
Well, here I am. Tell me.

18:40.978 --> 18:43.198
I can't.

18:44.548 --> 18:46.288
It's an ongoing investigation.

18:46.338 --> 18:47.664
All I can really say to you is that...

18:47.688 --> 18:49.298
You're doing the best you can.

18:49.338 --> 18:52.778
That's all the NYPD said, too.

18:52.818 --> 18:54.688
You know what those words mean?

18:54.738 --> 18:56.778
Nothing. It's insulting.

18:56.828 --> 18:58.608
- Mr. Eustace...
- I don't sleep.

18:58.648 --> 19:01.438
I... I don't eat.

19:01.478 --> 19:03.568
Lauren was all I had,

19:03.618 --> 19:05.138
and now the only thing I got left

19:05.178 --> 19:08.578
is finding the monster who did this.

19:08.618 --> 19:11.488
That... that's all I think about.

19:23.508 --> 19:26.508
I understand you're a man of faith.

19:26.548 --> 19:27.988
I am.

19:28.028 --> 19:30.768
Then you know where Lauren is.

19:32.648 --> 19:35.598
That she's okay.

19:37.388 --> 19:39.908
Do you have faith?

19:42.518 --> 19:46.178
I try.

19:46.218 --> 19:49.178
I guess your job doesn't help.

19:50.968 --> 19:53.798
Actually, it's the opposite.

19:57.148 --> 20:00.498
Every... every time we
get a dangerous criminal

20:00.538 --> 20:02.238
off of the street, or every time I get

20:02.278 --> 20:05.288
to deliver justice for a victim,

20:05.328 --> 20:07.508
it restores my faith.

20:10.728 --> 20:12.548
Mr. Eustace...

20:12.598 --> 20:15.078
I promise you, I will find the man

20:15.118 --> 20:18.468
who took your daughter from you.

20:19.648 --> 20:21.958
Maggie?

20:23.958 --> 20:25.648
Uh, you're busy.

20:25.698 --> 20:28.138
I'll let you go.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.838
And thank you.

20:38.058 --> 20:39.488
You got an address for Praeger?

20:39.538 --> 20:42.718
Yeah, let's roll.

20:42.758 --> 20:45.198
Did you just promise
him what I think you did?

20:52.068 --> 20:54.508
Delivery! Doorman sent me in!

20:54.548 --> 20:56.508
Wrong apartment.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.428
Delivery for "Dr. Praeger"?

20:59.468 --> 21:01.948
You gotta sign for it.

21:01.998 --> 21:03.648
Doorman's not supposed to just...

21:03.688 --> 21:05.128
FBI.

21:05.168 --> 21:07.388
- What the hell are you doing?
- We've got right.

21:07.438 --> 21:10.438
Clear team, south side, let's go.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.088
- Left side.
- Upstairs.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.438
Don't move.

21:13.478 --> 21:17.138
- Hey, bag his phone.
- Yes, ma'am.

21:17.178 --> 21:19.268
Find any hard drives, tablets...

21:19.318 --> 21:22.148
anything and everything
that might have a photo.

21:23.578 --> 21:26.498
Thumb drives, firewire,
paper... let's grab it all.

21:28.538 --> 21:31.938
We've got the lower level.
We're headed down now.

21:31.978 --> 21:33.678
Could you watch the hands, please?

21:33.718 --> 21:35.768
I'm a surgeon.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.868
Polaroid.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.698
An original.

21:51.738 --> 21:53.178
Don't worry, Doc.

21:53.218 --> 21:56.008
Something tells me you won't
be doing any more surgeries.

22:15.529 --> 22:17.089
What am I being charged with?

22:17.114 --> 22:18.353
We're gonna get to that,

22:18.378 --> 22:21.248
but first I need to verify some facts.

22:22.818 --> 22:24.818
We found these photos
on your hard drive.

22:24.858 --> 22:27.118
Is this one of your patients?

22:27.168 --> 22:30.468
Did you sedate her before
you took this photo?

22:32.488 --> 22:34.255
All right, clearly you
don't want to discuss this,

22:34.279 --> 22:37.088
so I'm just gonna get right to it.

22:42.398 --> 22:44.838
It's a picture.

22:47.321 --> 22:48.451
What do you want to know?

22:48.476 --> 22:50.566
Why you painted the smile on her face

22:50.591 --> 22:53.058
before you killed her.

22:58.238 --> 23:00.458
I would like to call my attorney.

23:05.647 --> 23:08.607
This guy can lawyer up all
he wants, he's good for it.

23:08.632 --> 23:10.585
- He's not.
- What?

23:10.610 --> 23:13.740
His DNA does not match
the DNA on the victim.

23:13.868 --> 23:16.778
So why does he have a polaroid
of one of the victims?

23:16.828 --> 23:18.014
He has a polaroid of one of the victims

23:18.038 --> 23:19.868
with the real killer's DNA on it.

23:19.918 --> 23:23.300
The lab found a second DNA profile
on the photograph.

23:23.325 --> 23:24.878
Positive match to the Apex Killer.

23:25.741 --> 23:28.051
So these degenerates are friends?

23:28.076 --> 23:29.264
What, they're just
sitting around swapping

23:29.288 --> 23:31.118
disgusting photos with each other?

23:31.143 --> 23:33.398
Well, either way, it's clear
Praeger knows the identity

23:33.423 --> 23:35.383
of the Apex Killer, so
when that lawyer shows up,

23:35.408 --> 23:39.018
you two are gonna
convince him to cooperate.

23:39.216 --> 23:41.656
The photos we found on
your client's hard drive

23:41.696 --> 23:45.096
will put him in prison
for 20, maybe 30 years.

23:45.136 --> 23:46.656
Save the speech.

23:46.706 --> 23:48.162
We just want to know what kind of deal

23:48.186 --> 23:49.836
you're willing to offer.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.926
AUSA will recommend a downward departure

23:51.951 --> 23:54.221
on sentencing guidelines.

23:54.276 --> 23:56.936
You're looking at 15 years...

23:56.976 --> 24:00.156
If you cooperate.

24:07.726 --> 24:09.986
What do you want to know?

24:12.426 --> 24:15.556
I want to know who gave you this photo.

24:15.606 --> 24:18.436
Don't know his name. I met him at Hedon.

24:18.476 --> 24:20.386
"Hedon"?

24:20.436 --> 24:22.826
It's a sex club.

24:22.866 --> 24:24.826
High-end, members only.

24:24.876 --> 24:26.046
He's there all the time.

24:26.096 --> 24:29.006
And the polaroid?

24:29.046 --> 24:31.396
One night, we got talking,

24:31.446 --> 24:34.316
and it turns out that we're both into...

24:34.356 --> 24:37.106
well, photos.

24:37.146 --> 24:40.496
A week later, he brought
me one of his favorites,

24:40.536 --> 24:44.066
and the next time I brought
him one of mine, so on.

24:44.106 --> 24:46.286
That's how I got the polaroid.

24:46.326 --> 24:48.416
Hmm.

24:50.076 --> 24:52.246
Do you recognize anybody in these photos

24:52.271 --> 24:55.091
taken at the last crime scene?

24:56.596 --> 24:59.646
The guy who gave me the
polaroid had brown hair.

24:59.686 --> 25:01.296
I... I can't be 100%...

25:01.346 --> 25:02.412
this cap is sort of throwing me...

25:02.436 --> 25:03.736
but... but that might be him.

25:03.786 --> 25:06.436
The one with the cellphone.

25:08.176 --> 25:10.131
Okay, so I held up my end of the deal.

25:10.156 --> 25:11.977
You're gonna talk to AUSA, right?

25:12.002 --> 25:14.370
Yeah, but not until you
take us to that sex club

25:14.395 --> 25:17.175
and ID the man that
gave you the polaroid.

25:21.276 --> 25:22.666
Backup is in place.

25:22.716 --> 25:24.756
All right, we're going in.

25:24.781 --> 25:26.013
Good luck.

25:26.038 --> 25:27.781
And uh, try not to touch anything.

25:29.311 --> 25:30.420
Hey, how's it going?

25:30.445 --> 25:33.055
I, uh, have some
friends with me tonight.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.780
Thanks.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.206
- Here.
- They have visitor passes?

25:37.246 --> 25:39.386
The "V" is for voyeur. Put them on.

25:39.426 --> 25:40.532
Anywhere that says "members only"

25:40.556 --> 25:41.646
you're not allowed.

25:41.686 --> 25:45.036
Unless you want to participate.

25:47.996 --> 25:49.696
Okay, Jubal, we're in.

25:49.736 --> 25:50.916
All good.

25:50.956 --> 25:54.136
- Do you see him?
- Nope.

26:07.806 --> 26:09.153
Oh, there he is.

26:09.178 --> 26:11.403
Uh, don't... don't turn
around, he's looking this way.

26:11.428 --> 26:13.818
- Where?
- Straight back by the bar.

26:16.475 --> 26:17.915
OA, he's on your seven.

26:17.940 --> 26:20.210
Take Praeger, circle
back, and get behind him.

26:27.996 --> 26:31.476
Hey, Jubal, we have a possible.

26:31.516 --> 26:33.786
Stand by.

27:25.213 --> 27:26.900
Hey, you're not
supposed to be down here.

27:26.925 --> 27:28.382
- I'm looking for a friend.
- You're coming with me.

27:28.406 --> 27:30.496
Get off me!

27:35.586 --> 27:37.546
- Hey!
- I'm the FBI...

27:39.716 --> 27:41.636
I'm FBI!

27:41.676 --> 27:42.996
I got this, get him!

28:00.786 --> 28:02.743
Jubal, there's a third exit in the club.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.230
- It's by the construction site.
- You sure?

28:04.254 --> 28:05.661
There's nothing in the building records.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.645
Yeah, well, I just used it.

28:09.552 --> 28:10.852
- Apex?
- He's gone.

28:23.696 --> 28:25.166
There, that's the man Praeger ID'd.

28:25.506 --> 28:27.636
Okay, let's see.

28:31.426 --> 28:32.596
Got him.

28:32.621 --> 28:34.181
His name is Robert Burke IV.

28:34.206 --> 28:36.156
Burke?

28:36.493 --> 28:38.883
Well, that'll complicate things.

28:39.224 --> 28:41.314
Why do I recognize that name?

28:41.339 --> 28:42.814
I don't know, you ever
driven down 6th Avenue

28:42.838 --> 28:44.538
between 46th and 51st?

28:44.626 --> 28:46.326
Probably, why?

28:46.351 --> 28:48.131
Robert Burke owns it.

28:48.156 --> 28:50.116
Or, more accurately, his family does.

28:50.431 --> 28:55.269
Burke's one of the largest real
estate owners in Manhattan.

28:55.294 --> 28:56.474
We strongly believe

28:56.499 --> 28:58.521
Robert Burke is the Apex Killer.

28:58.546 --> 29:01.726
You see that skyline?
Burke's family owns 4% of it.

29:01.946 --> 29:04.166
Money like that is what we
in the business like to call

29:04.191 --> 29:05.371
"a flight risk."

29:05.396 --> 29:06.837
To prevent him from leaving the country,

29:06.861 --> 29:09.261
we've put out a BOLO on him
and we're watching every exit.

29:09.286 --> 29:11.345
That's right. The Port Authority
is covering Penn Station,

29:11.369 --> 29:13.276
New York Transit's got Grand Central.

29:13.301 --> 29:15.453
and FBI will take JFK, LaGuardia,

29:15.478 --> 29:17.000
and the private airports on the island.

29:17.024 --> 29:18.480
He's not in his Manhattan apartment.

29:18.504 --> 29:19.934
His car is still in the garage.

29:19.984 --> 29:22.504
We have agents sitting on
both in case he shows up.

29:22.544 --> 29:24.400
We got anything off his
cell, ATM, credit card?

29:24.424 --> 29:26.570
Uh, he turned off his
cellphone so we can't track it,

29:26.594 --> 29:28.464
and he hasn't been
using his credit cards.

29:28.514 --> 29:30.367
Right, so he's clever.
Well, you know what?

29:30.392 --> 29:31.530
We have bigger and better toys

29:31.554 --> 29:32.840
than even the well-heeled Mr. Burke.

29:32.864 --> 29:34.304
Let's find him!

29:34.329 --> 29:36.651
What else do we know about
Burke, other than he's rich?

29:36.676 --> 29:39.286
He went to Exeter and then Princeton.

29:39.524 --> 29:42.834
He graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

29:42.874 --> 29:45.168
On paper, Burke's a hell of a guy.

29:45.193 --> 29:47.404
His ex-wife might have a
different opinion, though.

29:47.429 --> 29:49.079
Called for divorce three months ago.

29:49.104 --> 29:50.162
Really?

29:50.187 --> 29:52.080
Just before he started
dumping victims in Manhattan.

29:52.104 --> 29:54.664
Maybe his divorce
triggered the escalation.

29:54.714 --> 29:56.804
- Right.
- Bring her in.

29:56.844 --> 29:59.104
Okay.

30:01.913 --> 30:03.713
I haven't heard from
Robert in three months,

30:03.738 --> 30:06.204
but I read the "Post."

30:06.244 --> 30:09.684
Those murdered girls.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.384
It's him, isn't it?

30:11.424 --> 30:14.344
What... what makes you say that?

30:14.384 --> 30:17.084
People always told me
Robert wasn't normal,

30:17.124 --> 30:20.694
but I was in love.

30:20.734 --> 30:23.304
To me, he was just eccentric.

30:23.344 --> 30:26.862
He wasn't trapped by
people's expectations of him.

30:26.887 --> 30:28.268
I see.

30:28.293 --> 30:29.964
That's what made him interesting.

30:30.004 --> 30:31.444
Right.

30:31.484 --> 30:34.094
Why did you divorce him?

30:35.794 --> 30:38.404
I started to see what
everyone had been saying.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.454
That he was odd?

30:41.494 --> 30:44.234
More like sick and twisted.

30:51.294 --> 30:54.514
I haven't told anyone this.

31:02.214 --> 31:04.524
Three months ago...

31:04.564 --> 31:07.214
he drugged me, and I'm his wife.

31:11.004 --> 31:14.004
He did certain things to me...

31:16.094 --> 31:17.494
He took pictures.

31:17.534 --> 31:19.494
You found them?

31:19.534 --> 31:21.714
He showed them to me at
breakfast the next morning.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.279
He didn't even think it was weird.

31:23.304 --> 31:25.129
He just kept saying
how beautiful I looked.

31:25.154 --> 31:27.203
How great the light was.

31:27.228 --> 31:30.504
How cinematic the photos were.

31:33.894 --> 31:36.424
I filed for divorce...

31:36.464 --> 31:39.034
that afternoon.

31:41.474 --> 31:44.564
Do you know where he might be?

31:44.604 --> 31:45.954
Do you know where he would go

31:45.994 --> 31:48.044
if he thought he was in trouble?

31:48.084 --> 31:50.635
His family has a farm in Far Hills,

31:50.660 --> 31:51.954
a house in Greenwich,

31:52.004 --> 31:53.914
a summer place in South Hampton.

31:53.964 --> 31:55.878
Do you think he prefers
one over the other?

31:55.903 --> 31:57.490
No, not really, but
you guys are the FBI.

31:57.514 --> 31:59.899
Can't you just break
in and search the place?

31:59.924 --> 32:01.404
Not without evidence.

32:01.444 --> 32:04.314
But right now, all we have is a theory.

32:04.364 --> 32:07.804
Has he been to your new apartment?

32:07.844 --> 32:11.234
He came to the lobby once
to deliver an apology letter.

32:11.284 --> 32:14.154
Do you still have it?

32:16.414 --> 32:19.554
Yeah, my lawyer told me to hold onto it.

32:22.644 --> 32:25.229
Good news, there was
saliva on the envelope.

32:25.254 --> 32:27.824
We did a rush DNA
analysis and it's a match

32:27.849 --> 32:30.059
- to the DNA found on the last three victims.
- Yes.

32:30.084 --> 32:32.150
I'll get you a search
warrant for his home address.

32:32.174 --> 32:33.410
And for the other
three family properties.

32:33.434 --> 32:35.484
Okay.

32:35.524 --> 32:37.524
Federal agents!

32:37.574 --> 32:38.914
FBI!

32:40.354 --> 32:42.484
To your right, rotate to your right.

32:42.534 --> 32:46.574
Up topside, topside. Coming up.

32:46.624 --> 32:49.494
Criss-cross, criss-cross.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.494
- Contact!
- FBI! Hands up!

32:51.544 --> 32:53.194
No!

32:53.234 --> 32:54.804
Robert Burke, is he here?

32:54.844 --> 32:58.101
N-no, I... no, he's not here!

32:58.126 --> 33:00.334
I don't know where he is!
I'm just his cleaning lady!

33:00.374 --> 33:02.684
Okay, please escort her out.

33:05.204 --> 33:07.554
Ma'am, this way.

33:09.734 --> 33:11.084
Hey, OA.

33:11.124 --> 33:12.994
His ApplePie account is open.

33:13.044 --> 33:14.864
Tell me we can access
his message history.

33:14.914 --> 33:17.524
Just the last one.

33:17.564 --> 33:18.824
How did he get in here

33:18.874 --> 33:20.070
without our surveillance
team spotting him?

33:20.094 --> 33:22.354
He didn't. Linked with his cellphone.

33:22.394 --> 33:24.054
Shygurl1990.

33:24.094 --> 33:27.603
"I'm so excited to finally
meet you face to face."

33:27.628 --> 33:30.104
He replied, "Me, too, see you soon."

33:30.144 --> 33:32.494
That was 40 minutes ago.

33:32.534 --> 33:34.884
He's meeting up with his next victim.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.916
All right, so it looks
like Burke sent the DM

33:45.941 --> 33:47.795
from his Midtown office and
then turned off his cell,

33:47.819 --> 33:48.899
so we can't track it.

33:48.924 --> 33:51.339
We're still trying to ID shygurl1990,

33:51.364 --> 33:53.274
but so far no luck.

33:53.314 --> 33:55.274
I'm hoping that maybe she got cold feet

33:55.324 --> 33:57.011
and never showed up for the date.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.222
All right, listen up, everybody.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.108
There's a good chance
that Burke has drugged

34:00.148 --> 34:01.978
his latest victim and is en route

34:02.018 --> 34:04.548
to a secondary location,
where he has the privacy

34:04.588 --> 34:06.458
to begin his killing ritual.

34:06.508 --> 34:08.034
That's right, we've got eyes on all

34:08.060 --> 34:09.598
the family's residential properties.

34:09.638 --> 34:11.338
We've got five-man
Special Operation groups

34:11.378 --> 34:14.428
at each site... Far Hills,
Greenwich, and South Hampton.

34:14.467 --> 34:15.947
We've also got agents stationed

34:15.998 --> 34:18.868
outside Burke's apartment and office.

34:21.777 --> 34:23.828
Uh, but we cannot count
on Burke showing up

34:23.868 --> 34:26.088
to any of these, so
where else might he go?

34:26.138 --> 34:28.398
Let's dig deep.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.447
What is it?

34:34.487 --> 34:36.838
You kicked in Robert Burke's door.

34:36.888 --> 34:38.368
You're damn right, we did.

34:38.408 --> 34:39.848
- Based on what?
- DNA.

34:39.888 --> 34:42.538
DNA from a letter left with a doorman.

34:42.588 --> 34:44.888
There's no chain of custody.

34:44.938 --> 34:48.197
We can't legally prove the
DNA actually belongs to Burke.

34:48.237 --> 34:50.678
This monster just grabbed another girl,

34:50.728 --> 34:53.898
and you and I are standing here
discussing chain of custody?

34:53.947 --> 34:56.460
Until you physically swab his mouth,

34:56.485 --> 35:00.688
he is a person of interest.

35:00.738 --> 35:03.908
You can surveille, or detain,
or execute a search warrant.

35:03.958 --> 35:06.568
No-knock searches are off-limits.

35:06.608 --> 35:08.478
If someone doesn't open the door,

35:08.528 --> 35:11.048
or if somebody is not home, you wait.

35:11.088 --> 35:13.308
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

35:13.358 --> 35:16.618
I am conveying the
position of the Mayor.

35:16.658 --> 35:20.538
And you know how he does business.

35:20.578 --> 35:24.238
Got it.

35:24.278 --> 35:25.758
It's a bunch of crap, huh?

35:25.798 --> 35:27.848
A lot of eyes on this
one, so we have to proceed

35:27.888 --> 35:29.678
with caution and check all the boxes.

35:29.718 --> 35:32.418
Yeah, tell that to the
parents of shygurl1990.

35:32.458 --> 35:33.588
Yeah.

35:33.638 --> 35:36.118
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:36.158 --> 35:38.791
- I think Burke is here in Manhattan.
- Yeah?

35:38.816 --> 35:41.476
It's part of his elitist,
old money ego trip.

35:44.078 --> 35:45.818
Look.

35:45.868 --> 35:48.336
He thinks that he's a photographer.

35:48.361 --> 35:50.064
You know, he poses some of his victims

35:50.088 --> 35:52.828
and he... he makes sure that
the lighting is just right.

35:54.828 --> 35:57.268
He's gotta have some sort of studio.

35:57.308 --> 36:00.188
You know, a personal
space where it's private

36:00.228 --> 36:03.148
and he feels comfortable
enough to be this creative.

36:03.188 --> 36:07.318
Or where he plays with
the objects he loves.

36:07.343 --> 36:09.033
Check his credit card.

36:09.058 --> 36:11.148
See if he purchased any photo equipment.

36:11.238 --> 36:13.238
Cameras, lenses.

36:13.288 --> 36:15.938
Oh, okay, it looks like
he picked up something

36:15.978 --> 36:17.133
called negative scanners.

36:17.158 --> 36:18.813
That sounds like photo equipment.

36:18.852 --> 36:22.915
Seems like he purchased two
in 2016 for $25,000 apiece,

36:22.940 --> 36:25.579
and they were delivered to
a 258 Mott Street address.

36:25.604 --> 36:26.942
It's a commercial building.

36:26.982 --> 36:29.515
I mean, I can track the owner
but it will take some time.

36:29.540 --> 36:30.570
Well, we don't have time. Go.

36:30.594 --> 36:33.296
And, OA, we have a lot
of eyes on us right now,

36:33.321 --> 36:34.992
so we need you to wear a body cam, okay?

36:35.042 --> 36:36.992
Okay.

36:42.392 --> 36:44.092
You hear that?

36:44.132 --> 36:46.742
Yeah, you're right. He's here.

36:46.792 --> 36:49.159
Hey, Dana, we're outside Burke's studio.

36:49.184 --> 36:51.542
There's music playing inside.
I think someone's here.

36:51.567 --> 36:54.315
Dana, we talked about this.

36:56.892 --> 36:58.542
Maggie, knock. Identify yourself.

36:58.567 --> 37:00.877
If he answers, execute
the search warrant.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.487
- Sorry, you want me to knock?
- You heard me.

37:08.147 --> 37:11.147
Robert Burke, this is the FBI!

37:11.197 --> 37:14.157
We have a warrant to
search your premises!

37:17.847 --> 37:21.077
Robert Burke, this is the FBI!

37:21.117 --> 37:24.857
Dana, he's not answering,
but there's somebody in there.

37:24.907 --> 37:26.517
Dana?

37:28.727 --> 37:30.347
Dana, you said don't ask for the ball

37:30.387 --> 37:34.257
unless I can make the shot.

37:34.307 --> 37:36.127
Maggie, it's more complicated.

37:36.177 --> 37:37.787
All due respect, it's not.

37:37.827 --> 37:40.397
Please, give me the green light.

37:45.836 --> 37:46.836
You got it.

37:46.861 --> 37:49.227
You kick that damn door down now.

38:39.147 --> 38:41.717
Oh, God.

38:41.757 --> 38:43.637
Let her go.

38:43.677 --> 38:46.457
Robert, it's over.

38:46.507 --> 38:48.897
Let her go now.

38:52.987 --> 38:55.637
I am...

38:55.727 --> 38:58.257
the Apex.

39:09.437 --> 39:11.927
Talk to me.

39:11.967 --> 39:13.667
Okay.

39:13.692 --> 39:15.928
You're gonna be okay. You're okay.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.253
We got her, she's okay.

39:18.278 --> 39:20.708
Oh, thank God.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.823
Call an ambo now.

39:25.937 --> 39:27.327
It's okay.

39:36.064 --> 39:37.724
Congratulations.

39:39.867 --> 39:41.997
The Mayor's having a
press conference tomorrow.

39:42.037 --> 39:43.167
He wants you to join.

39:43.217 --> 39:45.257
Oh, sorry, can't.

39:45.307 --> 39:47.127
I have work to do.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.697
I'm guessing he won't mind

39:48.737 --> 39:51.267
being on that stage all by himself.

39:53.627 --> 39:56.197
That was a big risk you took,

39:56.222 --> 39:59.882
kicking down the door,
violating his order.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.327
The bigger risk would have been

40:07.367 --> 40:10.027
not kicking down that door.

40:12.717 --> 40:16.027
I appreciate your transparency, Dana.

40:16.077 --> 40:19.777
It's a very rare attribute.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.297
Especially around here.
