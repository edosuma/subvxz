<i>(vague distant noises)</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:06.227
Five,

01:07.233 --> 01:08.962
six,

01:09.969 --> 01:11.960
seven.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.408
Listen, stay away, stay away,
let's get out of the round.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.781
Just stay away.
Jake. Jake!

01:29.289 --> 01:30.278
Jake!

02:00.520 --> 02:04.183
That's it, punch him.
Come on.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.919
One, two, three,

02:09.996 --> 02:13.261
four, five, six,

02:13.333 --> 02:16.700
seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.760
He's out.

03:29.242 --> 03:33.338
- You look like you got your ass kicked.
- That's an early birthday present.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.974
Oh, yeah? So when you started crying,
was that part of the present?

03:37.050 --> 03:40.611
Son of a bitch.
Started crying? I would never cry.

03:40.687 --> 03:46.057
He was down for eight, crawled back up.
I felt so sorry for him, I took a nap.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.911
Hey, Jake.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.711
Jake!

04:17.490 --> 04:20.288
- You do the work on H-2?
- Yeah.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.988
Well, your cross-weld seams got bubbles.

04:23.062 --> 04:26.964
- They looked fine.
- Do 'em over.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.180
Jake, there's some guy from the Naval
Academy out there looking for you.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.121
- That's funny.
- I'm serious, man.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.659
He's out there looking for you right now.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.662
- He say what he wanted?
- No.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.679
Excuse me, sir.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.408
I'm Jake Huard.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.815
Lieutenant Commander Burton,
United States Naval Academy.

05:19.886 --> 05:24.016
Your application
made for some interesting reading.

05:24.090 --> 05:27.253
- Thank you.
- I kept going over it,

05:27.327 --> 05:30.057
to figure out why a congressman
would give a nomination

05:30.129 --> 05:33.098
to someone with
such mediocre grades and test scores.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.796
- He didn't want to give it to me at first.
- That's what he told me.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.772
He also said you were
the biggest pain in the ass he'd ever met.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.572
- I had to go back a couple times.
- How many?

05:47.246 --> 05:49.237
34 straight days, sir.

05:54.253 --> 05:57.154
We've had some spots open up
in this year's class.

05:57.223 --> 06:02.160
Couple kids decided last minute
they'd rather have fun at college.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.253
Induction day is tomorrow.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.925
I'm gonna be honest with you.
This is not an ideal situation.

06:09.001 --> 06:12.698
You'll be way behind the other students.
They've had months to prepare.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.263
That's all right, sir.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.901
- Well, then, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.605
I'll see you tomorrow at 0630.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.806
<i>(man)</i> I don't get it. I mean, I don't know
why you want to go to that place so bad.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.507
I mean, we're rivets. We build ships.

06:59.419 --> 07:05.119
Can you remember when my mom
used to take us there when we were kids?

07:05.191 --> 07:08.251
Yeah, and we all wanted
to wear the uniform and be the hero.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.125
But we were little kids then, Jake.

07:12.598 --> 07:16.967
- Well, I never stopped wanting that.
- So, this place isn't good enough for you?

07:17.036 --> 07:21.598
No, that's not it.
I just don't want to build ships.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.871
And what happens if that doesn't work out?

07:25.945 --> 07:27.936
It's gonna work out.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.078
I mean, I got dreams too, man.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.752
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:36.823 --> 07:40.919
Like going to Sir Frankie's tonight
and getting shitfaced.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.553
Tonight's your night.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.961
<i>(loud rock music)</i>

07:48.534 --> 07:52.595
We got plenty of room over at the VIP table
if you guys wanna join us.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.299
All right, Romeo.

07:54.373 --> 07:59.242
These girls are all over your Navy buddies,
man. Look at this place.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.779
- Oh, yes.
- Al right.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.246
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.805
To Jake.

08:04.450 --> 08:09.649
Listen, guys. You're my best friends
for as long as I can remember.

08:09.722 --> 08:15.820
That's why I gotta get outta here. If I can't
find better guys than you, I'm in trouble.

08:15.895 --> 08:19.729
See you at Christmas.
Be good.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.564
Yo, wait up.

08:26.272 --> 08:30.572
Look at her. You see the girl over there
with the long black hair?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.609
Yeah.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.703
Couple of us chipped in.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.606
- What, she's a hooker?
- No, she's not a hooker.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.482
She's an escort.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.386
Get outta here.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.187
Look, I swear on my mother.

08:47.260 --> 08:51.287
OK? Just go talk to her.
She ain't gonna bite you.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.333
That cost too much.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.402
Hi.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.171
I'm Jake.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.675
Ali.

09:06.746 --> 09:11.649
So, look... This is probably, like,
business as usual for you,

09:11.717 --> 09:15.585
but I've never
done anything like this before.

09:15.655 --> 09:16.485
Uh...

09:16.556 --> 09:18.717
Look, so you can just keep the money, I...

09:18.791 --> 09:21.885
What are you talking about?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.125
I swear on my mother.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.700
- You're not a prostitute.
- Uh, no, I...

09:33.773 --> 09:35.502
I am.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.635
But I'm really late
for my next appointment, so...

09:40.713 --> 09:43.944
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

09:44.016 --> 09:47.850
I'm sorry. OK?
They did say you were really expensive.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.981
Why did you think your friends
were trying to get you a prostitute, Jake?

09:52.058 --> 09:54.083
You trying to lose your virginity?

09:55.328 --> 09:56.818
Uh, actually...

09:56.896 --> 09:59.888
You were supposed to be
my going-away present.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.491
I'm going to the Naval Academy tomorrow.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.035
- You are?
- Yeah.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.095
It's a fairly rigorous selection process.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.641
Yeah, I know that. I've heard.

10:09.709 --> 10:14.169
Well, if you're interested, maybe
we could get together. I'll give you a tour.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.237
You know, I would love that.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.216
I'm... kinda feeling a connection here.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.277
- You are?
- Yeah.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.222
I mean, with me
so close to going to war, and...

10:25.291 --> 10:27.452
You're going to the academy.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.723
Well, yeah.
I think we should ask ourselves:

10:30.796 --> 10:35.426
can we afford to pass up
what is possibly our one night together?

10:35.501 --> 10:39.096
- <i>(man)</i> I'm gonna do something about it.
- <i>(man #2)</i> Is that right?

10:39.939 --> 10:42.499
- I... Just think about that.
- <i>(man)</i> AJ, chill.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.976
All right, all right, all right. AJ. AJ!

10:46.045 --> 10:48.479
What? I'm just saying hi
to your new friends.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.778
OK. All right.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.327
You all set?

11:12.004 --> 11:16.373
You sure this is what you want to do?
You're close to getting your hours.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.343
I don't want to join the union, Dad.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.176
Well, tell me.
What the hell is it you do want?

11:23.649 --> 11:26.345
I mean, come on, Jake.
Who we kidding?

11:26.419 --> 11:32.380
You don't listen to me or anybody here,
and you're gonna take orders from them?

11:32.458 --> 11:36.019
I'm sorry
I didn't give you two weeks' notice.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.859
Jake, Jake.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.363
I'll give you a ride.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.246
I'll see you at Christmas.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.232
- Go get 'em, son.
- I love you, Mom.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.139
All right, smile, now.

12:25.678 --> 12:30.172
<i>(man) 20 months ago,</i>
<i>50,000 young men and women</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:34.242
<i>inquired about applying to this academy.</i>

12:34.320 --> 12:41.055
<i>But this morning, only 1207 of you</i>
<i>passed through these gates.</i>

12:43.062 --> 12:47.192
<i>Some of you have</i>
<i>only known success your entire life.</i>

12:48.200 --> 12:54.662
<i>But this year, your plebe year,</i>
<i>you will know failure.</i>

12:56.408 --> 12:57.966
Welcome to the academy.

12:58.043 --> 13:03.174
<i>Because failure</i>
<i>is a far greater teacher than success.</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:10.078
Our standards
are both high and uncompromising.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.387
Some of you will fail to meet them.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.292
We make no apology for that

13:16.362 --> 13:20.423
because the mission
we have been entrusted with,

13:20.499 --> 13:25.903
transforming you
from civilians into naval officers,

13:25.971 --> 13:28.303
is too important.

13:30.009 --> 13:33.274
<i>(men chanting)</i>
Left. Left. Left, right, left...

13:40.286 --> 13:44.689
- Lock those elbows, Nance.
- Ma'am, aye aye, ma'am!

13:45.891 --> 13:49.918
<i>(man)</i> Come on, move it, meatheads, run!
Go, go, go!

13:52.031 --> 13:54.795
Keep that rifle up.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.263
You look surprised, Plebe Huard.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.067
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

14:02.374 --> 14:06.367
How many buildings at the academy
are named for admirals?

14:06.445 --> 14:09.209
- Ma'am, I'll find out, ma'am.
- That's one of your rates.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.909
You're required to know that information.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.646
Especially if you're gonna be offering tours.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.585
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.385
- Now drop and gimme 20.
- Aye aye, ma'am.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.800
What is that smell?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.501
- Is that you, Estrada?
- Sir, no, sir.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.873
You been taking Puerto Rican showers
instead of regular ones?

14:38.944 --> 14:41.742
- That what you're doing?
- Sir, no, sir!

14:41.814 --> 14:43.941
You stink.

14:44.016 --> 14:49.352
How about your beard?
Plebes are supposed to be clean-shaven.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.686
Sir, I shaved this morning, sir.
I just have a thick beard, sir.

14:52.758 --> 14:58.287
I want you to shower and shave
every three hours after lights out.

14:58.364 --> 15:02.391
And no more cologne.
Do you understand, Estrada?

15:02.468 --> 15:05.096
Sir, yes, sir!

15:06.105 --> 15:08.437
At ease.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.774
Attention on deck.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.213
Midshipman Lieutenant Cole.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.787
Get in.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.393
Sir, aye aye, sir.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.670
- Zip it up.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

16:31.323 --> 16:36.727
I want you all to remember
what that bag looks like with a body in it,

16:36.795 --> 16:42.756
'cause if you become officers, this is where
they're gonna put your mistakes.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.995
- Do you understand me?
- Sir, yes, sir.

16:50.909 --> 16:54.345
All of you came straight here
from high school.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.305
But not me.

17:00.753 --> 17:05.247
Before I got here,
I served three years in the Marines.

17:06.125 --> 17:09.685
Which means I'm more than
just a senior at this academy.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.199
I am someone who knows
exactly what it takes to become an officer.

17:16.935 --> 17:20.098
And I will accept nothing less from you.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.833
If that's not what you signed up for,

17:26.612 --> 17:31.015
there's nothing wrong with that.
Just let me know now.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.244
Just raise your hand.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.157
All right.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.487
Let's go for a little jog.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.897
<i>(woman)</i> Go!

17:52.771 --> 17:54.898
Go, go.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.168
Move it!

17:57.242 --> 17:59.301
Come on, Huard.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.346
Let's go.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.075
Risa, what are you doing?
Come on, let's go.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.879
Move it. Oh, God...

18:06.952 --> 18:09.216
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Faster, come on.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.219
Let's go, let's go. Move it.

18:17.129 --> 18:21.259
Come on, let's go. Move it, move it.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.665
Yo, move it, move it.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.732
You letting this girl beat you, Nance?
Move it, go.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.203
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.680
- Come on, Loo.
- <i>(man)</i> Don't let him beat you, Loo.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.114
Don't let him beat you.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.519
- Come on, Huard.
- <i>(man)</i> Come on, Loo, move those feet.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.922
Move those feet!
Run it out, Huard, run it out.

18:46.992 --> 18:50.120
- Good job, Loo. You too, Huard.
- <i>(man)</i> Let's go, Estrada.

18:50.195 --> 18:53.164
- <i>(woman)</i> Come on, Risa.
- Estrada, move. Move!

18:53.232 --> 18:55.757
Finish line's right here.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.736
Run. Keep doing it.
Come on, just a little further.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.706
- Let's go, Echo Company.
- <i>(man)</i> Run it out, guys, run it out.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.299
That's right, come on.
You're almost there.

19:05.377 --> 19:09.245
Let's go now.
All right, a little bit more.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.544
Good job.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.163
- What's the problem here?
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.

19:31.236 --> 19:34.865
- Stop trying and do it.
- Aye aye, sir.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.841
Come on, you butterball, move it.
Move it.

19:37.910 --> 19:42.813
There's a big juicy steak
waiting for you, and yams.

19:44.983 --> 19:48.646
Holy shit! You are pathetic.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.157
You're the only one
who can't make it up this thing.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.217
From now on,
I'm gonna start calling you Twins.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.427
You know why, Twins?

20:01.233 --> 20:04.031
Because I'm carrying the weight
of two human beings, sir.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.935
You're smart, too.
So you should be able to figure out

20:07.005 --> 20:10.634
that if you don't get your fat ass
up this climb by the end of this year,

20:10.709 --> 20:14.338
your fat ass is gonna be separated.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.099
What the hell are you doing?

20:42.174 --> 20:45.905
Just reminding myself
of what I'm fighting for.

20:48.347 --> 20:49.712
Hey, Huard.

20:49.781 --> 20:54.047
Don't worry. That book's
gonna be all in your head soon.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.246
Yeah, I hope.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.915
You should learn to make your bed first.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.055
What?

21:02.127 --> 21:04.891
Fold's gotta be 12 inches from the top.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.000
Loo.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.107
Nance.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.012
What the hell? We only been here a week.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.913
- Estrada.
- Nice!

21:28.987 --> 21:33.321
Oh, this is from that chick
that I met at the shore this summer.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.658
Ho ho!

21:38.997 --> 21:41.329
Sorry, Carmen.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.534
<i>(Nance)</i> Before you achieve,
you must believe.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.270
Before you achieve, you must believe.

21:52.411 --> 21:56.905
Before you achieve, you must believe.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.985
Before you achieve, you must believe.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.780
Hey. Doctor Phil.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.188
Shut your hole.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.392
<i>(Ali)</i> 20.

22:10.462 --> 22:14.228
<i>(Loo)</i> 54º, 85' north.

22:15.233 --> 22:17.133
<i>(Ali)</i> 15.

22:17.202 --> 22:21.332
<i>(Nance)</i> 166º, 10' west.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.141
- Let me help you.
- <i>(Ali)</i> 10.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.370
I got it.

22:26.812 --> 22:30.270
- There's a headwind here...
- I got it.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.945
40º, 80' north.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.010
<i>(Ali)</i> Five.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.613
<i>(whispers)</i> Come on, Jake.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.521
Time.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.126
Drill's over, Huard.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.993
<i>(Ali)</i> Next squad, you're up.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.768
<i>(man)</i> Make me a believer.
One, two, three, four...

23:00.846 --> 23:06.842
Mike Tyson once said,
"Everybody's got a plan until they get hit."

23:06.918 --> 23:08.886
You can say what you want about Tyson,

23:08.954 --> 23:12.754
but that's the smartest goddamn thing
I ever heard anybody say about boxing.

23:12.824 --> 23:16.089
Centre that weight.
You got no balance, I'd push you right over.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.287
Aye aye, sir.

23:17.362 --> 23:20.798
That is why we teach boxing here.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.996
You see, the powers that be
want to see how you react

23:25.070 --> 23:27.766
when you get popped in that mouth.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.340
They want to see how you hold up

23:31.410 --> 23:34.937
when your little plan goes to hell.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.208
Get that chin down.
Want to get knocked out?

23:37.282 --> 23:41.116
In 40 seconds
you're on the focus mitts with me.

23:41.186 --> 23:44.280
Pretty good, Huard. You boxed before?

23:45.190 --> 23:47.590
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you can tell.

23:47.659 --> 23:50.628
Jab's good, straight right's pretty crisp.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.664
Yeah. You hook like a girl, though.

23:58.904 --> 24:01.236
I hook like a girl?

24:06.745 --> 24:08.610
- Hey, Loo.
- Hey.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.581
- You finished your calc homework yet?
- Ah, jeez...

24:11.650 --> 24:14.175
- I just wanna check my answers.
- Nice try, Estrada.

24:14.252 --> 24:17.278
- I didn't get a chance to finish mine.
- Look, I made the time.

24:17.355 --> 24:20.051
- It's just a homework assignment.
- Sorry, man.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.288
You know how you're gonna die, Loo?
Friendly fire.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.524
- I'll help you.
- No offence, but I wanna pass, Huard.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.499
What is this?

24:29.568 --> 24:34.403
Restricted diet means no pogey bait,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.498
Twins!

24:39.678 --> 24:42.203
Shove off.

24:49.354 --> 24:56.021
You do understand what "shove of"
means, don't you, Huard?

24:57.229 --> 25:00.858
Oh, I forgot. You're a wait lister.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.693
Well.

25:05.770 --> 25:11.299
Since you're here, why don't you
clean up your shipmate's mess?

25:23.255 --> 25:25.587
<i>(clicking)</i>

25:37.869 --> 25:40.360
<i>(Huard)</i> Psst.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.897
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.615
What are you looking at? Porn?

25:53.685 --> 25:56.347
It's not porn.

26:00.959 --> 26:05.419
- <i>(Huard)</i> Was that parade for you?
- I'm from kind of a small town,

26:05.497 --> 26:08.193
so me getting in here was a big deal.

26:08.266 --> 26:13.033
I hadn't even decided to come when I
found out they were throwing me a parade.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.368
No wonder you get mail every day.

26:20.946 --> 26:25.280
There've only been two times in my life
my father ever told me he was proud of me.

26:25.350 --> 26:30.378
Fourth grade, I knocked out this bully
who'd been picking on me.

26:30.455 --> 26:33.822
And the day I received
my acceptance here.

26:35.193 --> 26:37.525
<i>(door opens)</i>

26:40.498 --> 26:42.796
Hey, you guys looking at porn?

26:42.867 --> 26:44.858
Yeah.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.636
Someone explain why I can't hook up with
those girls until after my plebe year?

26:54.713 --> 26:57.147
Hook up?
Oh, man, we can't even kiss 'em.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.877
I'd explain it.
By giving your calc score today.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.614
Hey, hey. I got 57. That's an F+.

27:03.688 --> 27:06.555
- Huard got a G.
- Oh, man.

27:06.625 --> 27:11.062
All right, all right.
Hey, relax, Huard. I'm just playing.

27:11.129 --> 27:14.929
Hey, Huard. You gotta use more polish.
That's never gonna pass.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.997
Worry about your own, Marianne.
I'll worry about mine.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.528
You just don't get it, do you, Huard?
We're all tied together here.

27:22.607 --> 27:24.939
- I don't need your help, Loo.
- Yeah, you do.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.069
Hey, I know we're four guys in a shower,

27:27.145 --> 27:30.012
but can we keep
the testosterone to a minimum?

27:30.081 --> 27:33.710
Hey, Jake.
Help is like sex.

27:33.785 --> 27:36.447
Take it from whoever
and whenever you can get it.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.250
<i>(Ali)</i> Nance, how's the cow?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.851
Ma'am, she walks, she talks,
she's full of chalk.

27:43.928 --> 27:49.161
The lactic fluid extracted from the female of
the bovine species is highly prolific to the...

27:49.234 --> 27:51.600
fifth degree, ma'am.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.902
- Good job, Nance. Serve yourself.
- Ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.872
I'll give you an easy one, rivet.

28:02.781 --> 28:06.512
The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

28:06.584 --> 28:10.145
- Sir, eight, sir.
- Are you sure?

28:10.955 --> 28:13.355
'Cause you look
like you're guessing, Huard.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.393
Sir, I'm sure, sir.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.285
So you wouldn't have a problem

28:18.363 --> 28:20.957
betting your company mates' dinner
on your answer?

28:21.032 --> 28:23.159
Sir, no, sir.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.566
What about their lives?

28:28.640 --> 28:31.803
You said you were sure about the answer.

28:32.477 --> 28:36.243
Well, if you're sure,
stakes shouldn't matter.

28:36.681 --> 28:40.811
Loo. The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

28:40.885 --> 28:43.820
Sir, seven, sir.

28:43.888 --> 28:47.380
You just killed
everyone in your company, Huard.

28:48.893 --> 28:53.023
Everyone scrape your plates
back onto the platter.

28:54.332 --> 28:57.358
The worst officer is someone who guesses.

28:58.403 --> 29:03.807
Someone who's too afraid to admit
that they don't know the right answer.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.302
Those are the officers
who get people killed.

29:09.547 --> 29:12.107
You bet everyone's meal, Huard.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.919
Enjoy.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.729
<i>(beeping)</i>

29:45.984 --> 29:50.717
Sir, the uniform for noon meal formation
is Working Blues. Stripers carry swords.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.883
The menu for the noon meal
is baked chicken, roast beef,

29:53.958 --> 29:56.893
mashed potatoes, vegetables,
cannonballs and hard sauce.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.361
You now have ten minutes, sir.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.404
You don't stink so bad, Estrada.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.805
- You been taking your showers?
- Sir, yes, sir!

30:10.875 --> 30:15.903
All right, Estrada.
You can terminate Operation Disinfect.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.847
Sir, aye aye, sir!

30:20.218 --> 30:22.413
Carry on.

30:22.487 --> 30:26.685
Finally, a goddamn night of sleep. Oorah!

30:33.464 --> 30:36.365
Estrada, we need to talk.

30:37.569 --> 30:41.130
- You mean talk, or talk talk?
- You lied to Whitaker.

30:41.206 --> 30:46.701
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You didn't take a shower last night.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.941
So what?

30:52.016 --> 30:57.454
Look, man, I been taking those goddamn
showers every night for the past six weeks.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.616
- So what if I missed one?
- You gotta turn yourself in.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.660
Why?

31:02.727 --> 31:05.457
'Cause Whitaker's a racist prick?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.158
No, man.
I shouldn't have had to take those showers.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.895
It's not the showers.
It's the first thing we learnt.

31:10.969 --> 31:14.700
- Midshipmen are persons of integrity.
- Get off your soapbox, Loo!

31:14.772 --> 31:16.967
Loo, it's a shower.
We can take care of this.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.339
- You think I want to do this?
- Eat me, poster boy.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.243
- <i>(Loo)</i> Just tell the truth.
- Attention on deck!

31:34.959 --> 31:38.759
- Is this room ready for inspection?
- Sir, yes, sir!

31:38.830 --> 31:41.560
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.624
Loo.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.568
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.402
You mother...

31:49.474 --> 31:51.237
<i>(Huard)</i> Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.539
<i>(Nance)</i> Hey, hey, hey! Loo. Loo.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.738
Estrada, outside. Now.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.394
- Come on, Huard.
- Let's go, Risa. You can do this.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.164
We're gonna drown because of you, Risa.

32:19.103 --> 32:23.472
You're crying?
Your ship is sinking and you're crying?

32:23.541 --> 32:27.307
You're the reason
they say women don't belong here, Risa.

32:27.378 --> 32:30.905
It's girls like you who give us a bad name.

32:34.485 --> 32:36.885
- She gets the point, ma'am.
- What was that?

32:36.955 --> 32:40.618
Ma'am, I said
I think she gets the point, ma'am.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.226
Risa, out of the tank.

32:52.537 --> 32:56.132
You got a problem with the way
this company's being run, Huard?

32:56.207 --> 32:57.765
Sir, no, sir.

32:57.842 --> 33:03.542
You've got enough problems of your own
without worrying about Risa's.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.179
You want to hit me, Huard?

33:09.187 --> 33:13.089
- Go ahead.
- Cole, this is my drill. I'll handle it.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.884
All right, gentlemen. That's enough.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.718
Nice work, there, Cole.
Nice work. I like that.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.322
So you all think you're Rocky Marciano

33:49.394 --> 33:53.524
'cause you can tag your roommate
with a weak-ass right.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.158
So I had your commanding officer
come in here today

33:56.234 --> 33:59.203
to show you what real boxing is about,

33:59.270 --> 34:02.569
'cause if you make Brigades
next semester,

34:02.640 --> 34:05.131
that right there
is what you'll be looking at.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.905
Midshipman Cole
looks like he can go another round.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.708
- What do you say, Midshipman?
- Let's do it.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.806
Uh-oh.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.751
Anybody want to come in here with him?

34:15.820 --> 34:18.118
Huh?

34:18.188 --> 34:22.148
I hope you're this quiet
when you're sneaking up on the enemy.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.251
Loo.

34:24.328 --> 34:27.627
Loo. How about you?

34:27.697 --> 34:32.533
You and your mouth were Golden Gloves
champ at 185 in San Diego.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.628
Come on, champ.

34:34.705 --> 34:40.074
Sir, I would, sir, but I don't want
to give away my secrets until the Brigades.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.203
Pussy.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.239
Come on.

34:45.315 --> 34:48.842
This man has been making your life
miserable for the last two months.

34:48.920 --> 34:54.415
It's your chance for a little payback.
Anybody gonna come in here with him?

34:54.492 --> 34:56.221
I'll do it.

34:57.462 --> 35:01.626
- You're not in his weight class, Huard.
- I'll wear an extra T-shirt.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.802
You're not in his class class, either.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.481
- Come on, son.
- <i>(plebes)</i> All right, yeah!

35:19.550 --> 35:22.849
All right, Jake. You can do it.
You can do it, Jake.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.925
- Sure you want to do this, Huard?
- Yes, sir.

35:32.997 --> 35:35.591
All right, gentlemen. Let's box.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.072
All right, all right. It's a slip.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.114
It's OK. It's OK, Jake.
It's OK, Jake.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.676
Let's box.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.633
This ain't one of them smokers
from the shipyard, Huard.

36:13.704 --> 36:16.571
All right. You all right, son?
Let's go.

36:16.641 --> 36:19.303
Come on, man.
Stay in there. Stay in there, Jake.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.847
All right, all right, that's it.
That's it. That's it.

36:32.757 --> 36:34.987
Hope you didn't bet
anybody's meal on this.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.619
All right, that's it.
Get his gloves off.

36:37.695 --> 36:41.290
Boy's got heart, which is more
than I can say for all of y'all. But heart...

36:41.365 --> 36:43.356
What the hell are you doing?

36:43.434 --> 36:45.459
- Let him go.
- Show some discipline.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.197
- Let him go.
- Get out of the ring.

36:47.271 --> 36:51.173
Set an example for these plebes.
Settle down. Now!

36:54.645 --> 36:57.739
<i>(Burton)</i> Get your gear off.

36:57.815 --> 37:00.147
<i>(Cole)</i> All right.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.281
147 to go.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.858
- When are you taking off?
- I'm not.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.726
I gotta stay
and work on my time for the O-course.

38:20.798 --> 38:25.030
And, to be honest, I'm afraid
if I walk out of here, I won't come back.

38:25.936 --> 38:30.703
So, you have a good Christmas.
I'll see you after leave.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.836
Hey, Huard?

38:34.645 --> 38:37.011
I said, I'll see you after leave.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.682
Sir, yes, sir.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.341
Hey, how are you?

39:22.126 --> 39:24.424
Hey, it's Popeye the Sailor Man.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.030
Easy, easy, easy...

39:31.135 --> 39:33.296
- <i>(all)</i> Cheers!
- To Jake.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.932
- It's great to have you back.
- That's right.

39:38.843 --> 39:41.812
You say they kicked some guy out
for not taking a shower?

39:41.879 --> 39:45.246
Yeah. Yeah, they threw a couple out
for hooking up with girls, too.

39:45.316 --> 39:49.252
That sounds like bullshit to me, man.
I don't know why you put up with that crap.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.687
Well, it's not a job. It's an adventure.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.418
I'll drink to that.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.394
I'll drink to that.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.862
I'll drink to you drinking to that.

40:13.711 --> 40:14.871
Hey.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.946
The fight's about to start. You hungry?

40:22.019 --> 40:24.510
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

40:27.191 --> 40:30.456
So AJ said you guys
are a couple weeks behind.

40:30.528 --> 40:35.192
- Yeah, a little.
- I was wondering if you could use me.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.133
Well, I don't have any short time stuff.

40:39.170 --> 40:44.039
Yeah, well, I wasn't really
thinking about short time stuff.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.738
Are you sure this is what you want?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.375
OK.

41:01.525 --> 41:06.053
I'll talk to Mike tomorrow.
See what we can work out.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.620
Thanks.

41:07.698 --> 41:10.030
Should be a good fight.

41:23.681 --> 41:28.243
So I told Mike you would meet him
over at Sir Frankie's at five.

41:28.319 --> 41:32.187
Ah, that's all right.
I think I'm just gonna go home.

41:32.256 --> 41:34.247
What?

41:34.325 --> 41:37.692
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just tired.

41:52.743 --> 41:54.938
So how much did you collect?

41:55.012 --> 41:57.310
It's just for shits and giggles, man.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.941
How much?

42:00.017 --> 42:02.986
A little over 500.

42:08.058 --> 42:12.392
What's up?
AJ leave early or something?

42:17.635 --> 42:19.967
You all right?

42:21.772 --> 42:25.503
What kind of father
wants his own son to fail?

42:25.576 --> 42:28.170
- What are you talking about?
- You gave me my job back.

42:28.245 --> 42:30.839
- You asked for it back.
- And you said yes.

42:30.915 --> 42:34.043
- This is a good thing here.
- Yeah, not for me.

42:34.118 --> 42:37.884
You knew how bad I wanted to go
to the academy. You never said anything.

42:37.955 --> 42:43.120
Why? Would it kill you
that I might actually do better than you?

42:43.193 --> 42:48.096
You want the truth? I didn't want you to go
over there because I knew this'd happen.

42:48.165 --> 42:52.795
You'd be back here,
pissed off 'cause you didn't make it.

42:53.971 --> 42:59.034
Look, Jake, I know you promised
your mother that you'd go to the academy.

42:59.109 --> 43:01.942
And you tried, but it just didn't work out.

43:02.012 --> 43:07.109
Yeah. Maybe it would have
if she was the one who was still around.

43:10.054 --> 43:13.717
Look, I know I haven't been the best father.

43:14.558 --> 43:19.188
And you can blame me for a lot of things,
but this ain't one of them,

43:19.263 --> 43:24.997
'cause when it's all said and done,
I didn't quit. You did, Jake.

43:35.379 --> 43:39.145

44:16.787 --> 44:20.723
- What are you doing here?
- You know, just scoping out johns.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.151
You want a beer?

44:25.229 --> 44:27.129
Nah.

44:27.197 --> 44:29.358
How's your leave been?

44:29.967 --> 44:33.266
It's been a blast. How's yours?

44:33.337 --> 44:36.397
- OK.
- <i>(slow music on the jukebox)</i>

44:36.473 --> 44:39.738
You looking forward to heading back?

44:40.177 --> 44:43.408
Come on.
I thought you were gonna dance with me.

44:58.562 --> 45:01.497
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I cut in?

45:13.677 --> 45:16.510
This is nice.

45:16.580 --> 45:19.879
I don't think I've danced since high school.

45:20.584 --> 45:23.951
- No spring dances at the academy?
- No.

45:24.021 --> 45:26.353
Uh-uh. Never gone.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.221
Yeah, you can tell.

45:29.293 --> 45:31.761
Really? Says the guy
who keep stepping on my foot.

45:31.829 --> 45:33.820
Ow!

45:33.897 --> 45:36.365
Sorry.

45:39.303 --> 45:41.601
Why don't you go to the dances?

45:43.540 --> 45:48.239
Some guys at the academy
don't view women as their equals.

45:48.312 --> 45:51.213
It's worse if you start dating them.

45:54.151 --> 45:56.813
It's no fun being underestimated, is it?

46:00.257 --> 46:03.715
It's worse when you do it to yourself.

46:12.269 --> 46:14.260
Excuse me.

46:16.306 --> 46:19.537
I will see you tomorrow, Plebe Huard.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.276
Watch your feet.

46:41.465 --> 46:43.194
- Delta Company.
- Sir.

46:43.267 --> 46:48.762
One missing and unaccounted for.
Midshipman Fourth Class Butcher.

46:54.278 --> 46:57.736
- Echo Company.
- Sir, two missing and unaccounted for.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.079
Midshipman Fourth Class Casarico,

47:00.150 --> 47:02.141
Midshipman Fourth Class Huard.

47:07.124 --> 47:12.619
Ma'am, Midshipman Fourth Class Huard
is present and accounted for, ma'am.

47:22.472 --> 47:26.806
- In case you forgot, we wear uniform here.
- Sir, yes, sir.

47:26.877 --> 47:30.438
- Put yourself on report.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

47:38.956 --> 47:43.086
- Memorial Hall in ten, Huard.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

48:00.410 --> 48:02.435
Dead at 23.

48:03.580 --> 48:06.549
The best officer I ever served under.

48:08.218 --> 48:10.584
I'm sorry about your friend, sir.

48:10.654 --> 48:13.623
Why? He's not.

48:17.327 --> 48:19.921
Why are you here, Huard?

48:20.697 --> 48:22.790
To serve my country, sir.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.732
You say that here...

48:26.770 --> 48:30.729
where people actually died
for their country.

48:31.675 --> 48:34.269
You don't think I took Psych 101?

48:35.412 --> 48:38.245
You're here to answer the question
that's gnawed at you

48:38.315 --> 48:42.945
ever since you saw this place
from across the river.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.818
Well, let me spare you the suspense.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.691
You ain't good enough.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.159
I've heard that my whole life.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.659
But I'm still here.

48:56.266 --> 49:01.499
All the other company commanders here,
they're playing soldier.

49:02.506 --> 49:04.633
But I've been a soldier, Huard.

49:05.909 --> 49:08.969
I've seen what good officers are like.

49:11.014 --> 49:13.983
And I know what bad officers are like.

49:15.485 --> 49:20.445
So there ain't no way
I'm letting someone finish this year

49:20.524 --> 49:23.721
who's not worthy of this academy.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.661
I'm not quitting.

49:30.367 --> 49:35.168
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Wakey wakey!
Come on, Loo. Move, butterball!

49:35.973 --> 49:38.942
<i>(Cole)</i> Plebe Huard.
How many missiles are the Ohio class

49:39.009 --> 49:42.911
of ballistic missile submarines
capable of carrying?

49:42.980 --> 49:44.538
Sir, I'll find out, sir.

49:46.450 --> 49:52.355
Who was the youngest midshipman,
and how old was he?

49:53.090 --> 49:55.923
Sir, I'll find out, sir.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.325
I'm sure you will, Huard.

49:58.395 --> 50:00.863
Keep filling.

50:09.239 --> 50:10.467
<i>(whispers)</i> Stop.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.145
Congratulations, Loo.

50:17.714 --> 50:22.310
You can join Huard
on marching tours this weekend.

50:23.086 --> 50:24.644
Carry on.

50:24.721 --> 50:27.019
Understand this.

50:27.090 --> 50:32.255
When Plebe Huard
doesn't know his rates, none of you do.

50:33.263 --> 50:36.824
A company is only as strong
as its weakest plebe.

50:49.579 --> 50:53.709
You should get out too, Nance.
He's just gonna drag you down.

50:54.718 --> 50:57.050
He's right, you know.

50:59.289 --> 51:01.621
Can I borrow your starch?

51:02.659 --> 51:05.753
Look, I don't get it.
Why are you still here?

51:06.663 --> 51:10.963
- You want to know why I stay in this room?
- Yeah.

51:11.034 --> 51:14.197
'Cause, Jake, you're my Mississippi.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.032
I'm your what?

51:17.107 --> 51:21.009
People who live in Arkansas,
you know what their favorite state is?

51:21.078 --> 51:22.204
No.

51:22.279 --> 51:26.579
Mississippi. 'Cause Mississippi's
the only thing that keeps Arkansas

51:26.650 --> 51:30.177
from being the worst state
in the whole country.

51:30.253 --> 51:35.088
- I'm Mississippi.
- Well, you sure as hell ain't California.

51:35.158 --> 51:38.093
Listen, Cole and Whitaker
are so busy trying to run you out

51:38.161 --> 51:40.629
they forgot all about me.

51:40.697 --> 51:47.728
As a matter of fact, they've forgotten about
every other plebe in this whole company.

51:47.804 --> 51:52.571
That's why I stay in this room, Jake.
'Cause if Mississippi quits,

51:52.642 --> 51:57.739
then all of a sudden Arkansas
is the worst state in the whole country.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.448
Hey, where's my starch?

52:01.518 --> 52:04.146
- All right.
- Come on, chop chop.

52:13.830 --> 52:16.526
You're looking good, Huard.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.229
Pretty soon you'll be able
to keep up with my six-year-old daughter.

52:20.303 --> 52:23.033
When can I start boxing again, sir?

52:23.106 --> 52:25.904
When I make admiral.

52:25.976 --> 52:31.073
You knew better than to pull
that mess you pulled in my ring, son.

52:39.022 --> 52:41.115
Eyes on the ring.

52:41.191 --> 52:44.217
Brigades Tournament
begins in eight weeks.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.854
Training starts this Friday.

52:46.930 --> 52:52.334
Brigades is the biggest event
in this academy all year. You know why?

52:52.402 --> 52:58.068
Because the boxing ring is the only place
in this academy where everybody's equal.

52:58.141 --> 53:01.804
Doesn't matter what your rank is,
how many stripes you got,

53:01.878 --> 53:07.180
the only thing that is guaranteed
when you step inside these ropes:

53:08.852 --> 53:11.548
you're gonna find out who you are.

53:23.867 --> 53:26.631
This doesn't look like your room.

53:28.171 --> 53:31.265
What are you doing here, Huard?

53:31.341 --> 53:33.502
I'm training for the Brigades, sir.

53:35.845 --> 53:38.279
All right, Huard.

53:38.348 --> 53:40.339
Let's see how you're doing.

53:41.117 --> 53:43.347
Sir?

53:43.420 --> 53:45.911
Show me how
you're gonna win the Brigades.

53:47.991 --> 53:50.323
<i>(Burton)</i> Ding ding.

53:51.528 --> 53:55.259
Don't worry, Huard.
I'm not your company officer in here.

53:55.332 --> 53:58.460
I'm just a guy
looking to punch you in the mouth.

53:58.535 --> 54:03.802
Well, you can take a punch.
I guess we knew that already, didn't we?

54:06.243 --> 54:08.973
You can actually land a punch, too.

54:14.217 --> 54:16.344
- You're pretty good, Huard.
- Thanks.

54:16.419 --> 54:19.411
Against a 36-year-old
out-of-shape lieutenant.

54:32.035 --> 54:34.526
Not bad, Huard.

54:34.604 --> 54:39.405
You know, most of the boxers in the
Brigades are nationally ranked amateurs.

54:39.476 --> 54:42.809
Think you're gonna beat 'em
by hitting the bag for a couple hours?

54:42.879 --> 54:44.870
I'll do what I have to.

54:44.948 --> 54:48.111
Really? Without anyone training you?

54:48.184 --> 54:52.883
You think you're gonna be the first plebe
to get through here without anyone's help?

54:52.956 --> 54:55.356
I don't need anyone's help.

55:06.002 --> 55:08.698
No one thinks I'll make it anyway.

55:15.512 --> 55:20.245
Who do you think convinced the board
to take a chance on you?

55:24.954 --> 55:31.518
This ain't the shipyard, Huard. You can't
just will yourself through this place.

55:55.085 --> 55:56.882
Sorry. I'll be done in a minute.

56:04.928 --> 56:11.265
Here. Recent studies show that auditory
retention surpasses that of visual retention.

56:13.336 --> 56:14.360
OK.

56:14.437 --> 56:17.998
OK. Turn off the light
so I can get some sleep.

56:23.446 --> 56:25.937
<i>(Nance's voice)</i>
<i>What is the latitude of Annapolis?</i>

56:26.015 --> 56:29.246
<i>The latitude of Annapolis is 38.58º north.</i>

56:29.319 --> 56:30.411
Thanks.

56:37.293 --> 56:39.625
- Ma'am.
- Plebe Huard.

56:41.831 --> 56:44.322
- Everything OK?
- Yes, ma'am.

56:45.735 --> 56:48.067
You know I'm training for the Brigades.

56:48.138 --> 56:51.403
That's great, Huard. Good luck.

56:51.474 --> 56:53.704
Maybe we could work out together.

56:53.777 --> 56:56.940
Uh, no. I think I'm already
in pretty good shape, thanks.

56:57.013 --> 56:59.345
Ma'am.

57:02.485 --> 57:05.181
I need your help.

57:28.878 --> 57:32.177
What? Think you're gonna be
all alone in that ring?

57:36.085 --> 57:38.246
Come on. Come on.

57:38.321 --> 57:40.755
- Let's go.
- Come on.

57:56.973 --> 57:59.373
- Damn it.
- Come on.

58:00.109 --> 58:03.306
Before you achieve, you must believe.

58:03.379 --> 58:05.438
Let's go, Arkansas.

58:18.661 --> 58:23.155
Come on, Huard.
I've seen better footwork at Payless.

58:23.233 --> 58:24.700
Come on, get back in there.

58:24.767 --> 58:28.066
Better footwork at Payless?

58:48.725 --> 58:51.523
- Jake.
- What?

58:53.429 --> 58:57.763
You're trying to get into
Cole's weight class, right?

58:59.802 --> 59:01.667
Yeah.

59:05.341 --> 59:06.672
What's this?

59:06.743 --> 59:10.839
Well, you're not gonna get there
by just eating the stuff they serve you here.

59:10.914 --> 59:15.874
What you need, my friend, is the patented
Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

59:15.952 --> 59:18.819
which, I'm proud to say,

59:18.888 --> 59:25.384
has been perfected
after 18 years of dedicated research.

59:26.696 --> 59:29.790
- So you're gonna get me to 185?
- Hey.

59:29.866 --> 59:33.768
I'm not only the president
of the Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

59:33.836 --> 59:36.236
I'm also a client.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.825
Come on, get down in the mud.
Come on. Come on, buddy.

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:09.804
Up, up. Over, over.
Go, Arkansas. Come on.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:10.964
Let me see you run.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.776
<i>(Nance) How long have you been</i>
<i>in the Navy? All my bloomin' life.</i>

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:25.586
Just hook it over and we're done.
Hook it over and we're done. Here we go.

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.292
What happened to all my ball machines?

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:46.599
- Come on, Huard. Dance for me.
- Hit me once and you can talk like that.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:50.168
- I have. I think I hit you about five times.
- Ooh!

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.578
Make that six, Huard.

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:04.292
Three. That's three. Gimme one more.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.329
That was for momma.
Gimme one for daddy. Get up there.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:10.059
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.511
Not quite there, huh?

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.209
Come on. How bad do you want it?

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:08.254
OK, that's good. Stop.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:26.033
I never could have done it.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.269
What?

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:34.976
Made it through plebe year
if I could see my home every day.

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:42.649
Well, if I couldn't see it every day,
I probably would have quit a long time ago.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:51.428
You know, my mom
used to take me out here.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.526
We had a Sunfish.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.935
We'd park it down there.

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:05.373
She was the only person
who ever believed I'd make it here.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.144
She must be very proud of you.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.817
She would be.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.989
I'm sorry.

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:21.326
She's what's getting you through?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:27.197
Well... She's what got me here.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:33.038
But she's not the one
who's getting me through.

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.748
Matt Cole, 197.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.726
All right, Midshipman. You step down.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.289
Anybody else for heavyweight?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.095
- All right, I guess that's it, then.
- <i>(Nance)</i> One more heavyweight.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:12.038
- Huard, what are you doing?
- Weighing in.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.515
Jump rope contest is next week.
My daughter's looking forward to it.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.678
- Anybody else?
- Sir.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:21.018
You said the Brigades
were open to all midshipmen.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.183
I want to fight.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:35.535
Fine. I'm gonna draw up a permission slip
for your parents to sign. Hit the scales.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.756
Jake Huard, 185.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.300
Next up, heavyweight division:

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:19.136
Midshipman Loo
versus Midshipman Huard.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:22.302
- Let's go.
- <i>(crowd chants)</i> Loo! Loo! Loo! Loo!

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.710
<i>(chanting continues)</i>

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.582
You both received your instructions
in the dressing rooms.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.089
I want you to keep it clean.
Any questions?

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.489
Payback's a bitch, Huard.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:45.258
You set the pace out there, Huard.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.858
<i>(bell)</i>

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.284
Come on, Jake. One more.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.260
Hmm? Come on, hit me one time.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.891
One, two, three,

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:23.905
four, five, six, seven,

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.441
eight, nine, ten.

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.840
You're out.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.777
What is the latitude of Annapolis?

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.718
- Who were the first three admirals?
- How long have you been in the Navy?

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:43.157
Sir, the latitude of Annapolis
is 38.58º north.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:46.752
Sir, the first three admirals
were Dewey, Porter and Farragut.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:49.559
Sir, I've been in the Navy
all my bloomin' life, sir.

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:52.066
My mother's a mermaid,
my father's King Neptune.

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:56.298
Every bone in my body is a spar.
And when I spits, I spits tar.

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.966
I's hard, I is, I am, I are.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.605
All right. Everybody on your feet.

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.411
Everyone but Huard is dismissed.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.224
How about some more up-downs, Huard?

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:54.758
What? I'm a plebe. I love rolling
on the ground and freezing my ass off.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.127
Y'all trying to make me proud
out here tonight, huh?

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.069
- Oorah!
- <i>(plebes)</i> Oorah!

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.675
- Oorah!
- <i>(plebes)</i> Oorah!

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:16.613
Good. Time.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.381
- Nicely done, Huard.
- Thank you.

01:09:20.788 --> 01:09:25.953
Good job. Your left hook's getting there.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.526
- It's getting there?
- Mm-hm.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.930
- But it's not there yet?
- Not yet.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.992
- Really?
- Almost.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:38.096
- Why don't you show me? There.
- OK.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.165
- Not bad.
- All right.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:43.404
- Show me how to...
- It's just... the little things.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:47.540
Like, really get your weight behind it.
You know what I mean?

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:51.211
Ooh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.618
Oh...

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:56.715
- Jeez.
- Let me see. No, it's OK. I'm sorry.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.555
- Is it bleeding?
- Uh-uh.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.618
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:09.366
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:13.169
- I'm OK.
- No, I mean about...

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.803
About stopping.

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.280
Oh.

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:22.943
Well, why are you sorry?
I was the one who stopped.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.884
What did you say?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.890
It was getting a little hot.
I had to push you away.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:35.261
You know what? I think I hit you
over the head a little too hard there, Jake.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:49.838
One, two, three, four,

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:52.745
five, six, seven,

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:56.046
eight, nine, ten.

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.813
You're out!

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.060
You OK?

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.423
Nice smile, Huard.

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:15.732
Can't wait to see
what Cole does to it in the finals.

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:17.897
Good fight.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.132
No way.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:25.170
It's impressive, to be able to say
you helped build something like this.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.888
Take ten.

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.736
Hey.

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.332
The ship looks great.

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.001
Yeah, it might float.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:07.614
So, I know you're probably busy, but...

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:10.584
I have a fight next week. Saturday.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:14.850
It's the finals in the Brigades.
It's for the whole academy.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:17.391
We're still a little behind.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.450
Yeah. I get it.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.860
All right.

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:26.628
I guess I'll see you soon.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.603
Yeah, sure.

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:34.233
- Take care of yourself.
- All right. You too.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.816
The required time for plebes
is five minutes.

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:52.020
Failure to meet that requirement
will result in separation.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.927
There will be no retest.

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.988
Good luck.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.957
<i>(whistle)</i>

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.995
<i>(whistle)</i>

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.151
Keep going.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.332
This is nothing.
You're there. You're there.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.364
Put it over. Put it over.
Hook it over.

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:43.575
Come on. You got it.
Come on, duck down. You got it.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.637
Come on, that's it. Let's go. Let's go.

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.706
That's it. You got it.

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:54.021
Come on, Twins.
Show Whitaker. Show him. Let's go.

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:57.581
Yeah! That's it.
Last one. Last one.

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:16.672
- <i>(Loo)</i> Nice! Good job, Nance.
- Good job, man.

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.576
<i>(Cole)</i> Nance.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:22.640
5:04. You're four seconds over.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.749
Sir, give him another chance.
He can make it.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.055
5:04 is 5:04.

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:36.393
It's four seconds.
You know how far he's come?

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.948
Hey.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.854
They gave me the key to the city.
You know that?

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:14.129
You think I have to give it back?

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:18.436
Hey, this isn't over.
We can talk to Burton.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.775
Remember how I told you about
that bully I beat up in the fourth grade?

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.608
Mm-hm.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:33.913
Truth is, he tripped when he hit me
and knocked himself out on the pavement.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.923
Next day, he kicked the crap outta me
till I cried like a baby...

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:42.828
All right, come on, Arkansas.
You can't do this to yourself.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.092
I let 'em down.
I let my parents down...

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:52.038
You didn't let anyone down. We're gonna
work this out. It's gonna be fine...

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:54.268
Just stop it, Jake! OK?

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.243
It's over.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.105
I don't belong here, OK?

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.515
You belong here.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.723
I just need some time alone, all right?

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:11.784
OK.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.258
All right.

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.118
Switch.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:55.059
Thanks.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:00.468
You're ready, man.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.770
<i>(whistle)</i>

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.112
<i>(whistle)</i>

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.676
- Somebody jumped.
- <i>(whistle)</i>

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.034
<i>(man)</i> He's still breathing.
Go get some help.

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:44.946
<i>(Loo)</i> Jake! Get him off. Get him off!
Get off, Jake. Get up.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.079
- <i>(Jake)</i> You did this!
- Jake, take it easy.

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:50.090
- You happy?
- Cool off. Cool off, Jake, come on.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.991
Take it easy. Just take it easy.
It's not worth it, man.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.757
Cool off, man. You gotta cool off.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.012
So you're quitting?

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:56.216
What about your review board?

01:19:56.291 --> 01:20:00.921
I hit my superior officer.
We both know how it's gonna end.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:08.131
I asked for more time
to prepare my statement for the board.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:13.272
Your appearance
has been moved to Monday.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.775
After the Brigade finals.

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:23.113
I'm giving you
what you wanted all year, Huard.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.879
Hey.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:00.044
Hey.

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:06.718
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.061
Jake.

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.159
Yeah?

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.400
What time's the fight?

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:22.503
There are more important things
than the fight right now.

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:26.105
Listen, Jake. We're both lucky.

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.782
We got second chances.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.556
I'm not gonna waste mine.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.827
Neither are you.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:49.264
When you step in that ring,
you have three rounds

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.237
to find out who you are.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:58.037
Show 'em who you are, Mississippi.

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:17.284
<i>(uproar)</i>

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:29.768
<i>(AJ)</i> Hey, rivet!

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.807
Don't let me down. I got money on you.

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:45.678
OK. Here we go.

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:48.086
Good luck.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.054
Here we go.

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:03.468
OK. Fighters to the centre.

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:10.072
OK, gentlemen. You received
my instructions in the dressing room.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:13.581
Obey my commands. Touch gloves.

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.215
Come on, Jake!

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.915
<i>(bell)</i>

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:33.198
- All right, let's go, Huard.
- Come on, Jake.

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.361
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Wreck this guy, Cole.

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.768
Watch that jab.

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:43.103
<i>(Ali)</i> Come on, Huard. Step around.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:47.581
This kid Cole is probably
my best recruit in the last ten years.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.714
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Playtime's over.

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:53.549
- He's gotta pace himself.
- <i>(Whitaker)</i> Attack him!

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:59.760
- That's it.
- He's gotta slow it down.

01:25:02.797 --> 01:25:04.822
Here we go. Yes!

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.635
Put him down. Put him down!

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:14.066
- That's right.
- Oh, my God.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.303
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Where's your smile now,
Huard?

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:21.580
One, two, three...

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.310
- <i>(Loo)</i> Take the count.
...four...

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:27.787
- Get up, Jake.
...five, six, seven, eight.

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.117
Attaboy, Jake.

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:34.050
Box.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.154
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Here we go, baby.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:39.761
Stick and move. Stick and move.

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.961
Put him down. Put him down.

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:48.507
Stay off the ropes, Huard.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.603
Break. Break, break, break.

01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:01.846
<i>(Ali)</i> Defense, Jake. Hands up.

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:06.321
<i>(Loo)</i> Get outta that corner.
Get outta the corner!

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:11.091
<i>(bell)</i>

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.633
Break. Break!

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:26.709
<i>(Ali)</i> All right. Take a deep breath.
Relax. You OK?

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.772
Relax, you got this. OK, come on.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.717
Remember,
you're boxing in there, not brawling.

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:35.620
Look at me, Jake. Look at me.
I want you to watch him, OK?

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:38.352
Keep your hands up.
Make him come to you.

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:41.395
<i>(Whitaker)</i> You hear that?
You are dominating this fight.

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:45.125
You're the champ, OK? Two more rounds,
baby. Finish off this prick.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.933
- <i>(Ali)</i> All right? Do not charge him.
- <i>(Loo)</i> Let's go, Jake.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.930
Come on, Jake. Come on, let's go.

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:57.267
- <i>(bell)</i>
- Box.

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:07.251
Be patient. Just let him come to you.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.416
<i>(Whitaker)</i> Here we go.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:17.528
- Put him down.
- <i>(Ali)</i> Stay off the ropes, Jake. Come on.

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.667
How's your man Huard doing,
Lieutenant?

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.400
Come on, Cole.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.412
Come on, Huard. Let's go.

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.783
Move in on him, Jakey.

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.227
- Yeah, Huard.
- <i>(Whitaker)</i> No, no, attack him.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.231
- Get off the ropes.
- Yeah.

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:57.897
Watch it. Watch out, Jake,
you're leaving yourself open.

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.839
- Hands up. Hands up!
- Careful.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.004
<i>(bell)</i>

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.656
Touch gloves.

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:37.769
- <i>(Ali)</i> You've got this.
- <i>(Whitaker)</i> Go, Cole. He's got nothing left.

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.373
<i>(Loo)</i> Let's go, Jake.

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:05.459
<i>(Ali)</i> That's it, Jake.
Make him come to you.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.496

You're the champ. Come on.

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:32.650
...five, six, seven, eight.
- He wants some more!

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.160
Box.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:42.294
<i>(Ali)</i> There you go! Step around.

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:49.506
Here we go.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.308
You got him, Jake. This is your time.

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.408
- <i>(Whitaker)</i> Cole! Come on!
- <i>(Ali)</i> Yes!

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:59.578
What the hell are you doing?

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.884
- Come on, Huard.
- Work him. He's going down.

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:04.789
Just work the body.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:06.793
Let's go. 30 seconds.

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.794
Go for it.

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:12.958
Come on, Jake.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:20.574
He's getting tired, Jake.
You've gotta go for it. Go for it.

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.438
<i>(Ali)</i> 20 seconds, Huard.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.808
Come on, Huard. Yeah!

Keep your rhythm. Keep your rhythm.

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.310
Get outta the corner.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.752
<i>(Loo)</i> Ten seconds, Jake.
You gotta take him out now.

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.311

OK. Fighters to the centre.

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:17.495
Fighters to the centre. Let's go.

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:33.741
- Out the way.
- Let me get a shot.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.985
Sorry, man.

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:43.682
I told you. Hell of a fight.

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:47.023
Yeah, number one, baby.
Yeah, number one.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:57.464
You did great.

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:01.602

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:48.649
<i>(man)</i> Midshipman Huard, please stand.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:58.626
Mr. Huard, this review board
finds you guilty of insubordination.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.690
Sir, yes, sir.

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:06.997
However, based on the recommendation
of your company commander,

01:34:07.074 --> 01:34:10.168
this board has decided to retain you.

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:15.807
Your punishment
will be 95 days' restriction and 95 demerits.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:19.717
Punishment will commence immediately
upon your return from summer cruise.

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.982
Is that understood?

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.484
Sir, yes, sir.

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:40.736
Congratulations, Midshipman Huard.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:43.003

Congratulations.
You just completed your plebe year.

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:56.214
<i>(all)</i> Plebes no more!

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.956
Your summer leave starts...

- Now!
- <i>(all cheer)</i>

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:13.570

- Congratulations, Jake.
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:36.087
- Any plans before your summer cruise?
- Uh, yeah.

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:40.429
I think I might go over to Sir Frankie's
and see if there are any escorts around.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.991
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:44.401

I want to thank you.

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:20.905
- For what?
- For helping me with the review board.

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:25.576
It wasn't about you, Huard.
That was about this academy.

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.911
Good luck out there.

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:38.518
Sir.

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:45.192
What do you think would have happened
if that fight went another round?

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.292
You really want to find out?
