Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.520
Welcome to my Halloween
scary-time theater.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.590
My name is auggie,
and I'll be your ghost.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.926
Tonight, three tingling
tales of terror

00:27.928 --> 00:29.728
All about fear!

00:29.730 --> 00:31.697
What are you afraid of?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.966
Hmm?!

00:33.968 --> 00:38.604
- Auggie, dinner.
- I'm talking to
the people, mommy.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.906
I'm sure you are,
but it's time for dinner.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.976
- Say hello to them.
- How you doing?

00:44.944 --> 00:46.245
For real.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.515
How you doing
for real?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.517
Okay, finish talking
to your friends

00:51.519 --> 00:53.619
And get out of that
weird-shaped toy chest.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.989
- Where did you get that?
- You don't "vant" to know!

00:57.924 --> 01:00.426
Say bye-bye
to the people.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.760
Bye-bye.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.329
- Mean it.
- Come to dinner...

01:04.331 --> 01:06.365

I mean it.

Do you know what scares him?

01:17.845 --> 01:20.012
His fear is
the same size...

01:21.414 --> 01:23.682
As a softball.
And you know what goes

11:20.614 --> 11:22.213
Where the little bunny
gets bigger and bigger.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.150
- Oh.
- Can we go to sleep now?

11:25.152 --> 11:28.053
Yeah.
It's just shadows.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.121
Shadows can't hurt me.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.425
Your house is nice
and I am safe.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.866

12:00.253 --> 12:02.120
No, it's me, gammy.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.922
Come on,
gimme a hug.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.357
- ( both chuckle )
- hi, gammy hart.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.027
- How have you been?
- Well, I'm still
kicking, ri-ri.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.564
The old grim reaper has
gotta move a lot faster

12:12.566 --> 12:15.166
To catch up with me.
( laughing )

12:16.969 --> 12:19.204
Yeah.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.073
Not today, sammy.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.345
( laughs )

12:29.515 --> 12:32.984
Maybe if I didn't
see the shadows,
I could actually go to sleep.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.153
Fine.  Anything to get
you to sleep.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.257
You know, maya,
if it would be
easier for you,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.660
I could always
call my father and--

12:42.662 --> 12:44.629
Save me, daddy.
She has scary bunnies.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.598
- No.
- ( sighs )

12:46.600 --> 12:48.500
You're gonna make it
through the night,
you're gonna stay

12:48.502 --> 12:50.235
At my house
and you're gonna
be comfortable.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.271
I don't understand,
because I really like it
during the day.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.007
- So as long
as this curtain is up...
- I'm gonna be okay.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.375
- I promise.
- Good.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.379
Just shadows.
Shadows are just shadows.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.048
They can't hurt me.
No problem at all.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.387
- ( screams )
- okay.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.022
( both scream )

13:12.558 --> 13:14.559
- ( boys shout )
- ( girls scream )

13:14.561 --> 13:16.528
Farkle: Ladies.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.296
Both: Farkle!

13:21.000 --> 13:24.035
- Trick or treat!
- Why are you screaming?
You scared us.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.203
What are
you guys doing here?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.138
We were passing by
on our way home.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.574
- We thought we'd say hi.
- In the middle
of the night?

13:29.576 --> 13:32.477
- It's a quarter after 7:00.
- ( riley sighs )

13:32.479 --> 13:34.512
Then why'd you have me
go to sleep, maya?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.715
Trying to put myself
out of my misery.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.285
What are you scared of riley?
It's great out here.

13:40.287 --> 13:44.155
- There's nothing
to be scared of.
- I hear boys.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.090
You got boys in here?

13:47.059 --> 13:48.193
They're outside.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.362
Oh.  Oh, hiya, boys!
( laughs )

13:52.531 --> 13:54.299
Scary old lady.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.536
Farkle.  Oh.
( chuckles )

13:59.505 --> 14:00.772
Come on, lucas.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.107
Wanna learn how to
attract older ladies?

14:03.109 --> 14:04.309
No.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.513
- Bye, guys.
- See you.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.349
- ( sighs )
you know what?
- What?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.351
You don't actually need
to cover the window.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.321
- Why not?
- I was actually
scared of farkle

14:16.323 --> 14:18.223
Until he took
his mask off.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.725
And when he did,
it was just farkle.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.094
Yeah, farkle's
not scary at all.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.396
No, and neither is
your neighborhood.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.265
Once you take
its mask off.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.271
<i>( folk music playing )</i>

14:35.374 --> 14:37.308
It's actually
kind of pretty.

14:38.277 --> 14:40.278
I never noticed
that before.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.582
Yeah.  I like
your house, maya.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.218
Thank you, riley.
That makes me happy.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.153
- ( chuckles )
- good.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.422
So you wanna
go to sleep now?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.291
In a little bit.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.560
You mind if we
stay up awhile?

14:55.562 --> 14:58.296
Why?  Are you still
a little bit scared?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.732
Not anymore.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.134
I just wanna see
what happens next.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.436
( chuckles )

15:12.211 --> 15:14.579
<i>- ( screams )</i>
<i>- ( scary music playing )</i>

15:14.581 --> 15:17.181
Riley is still
at maya's house.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.450
But meanwhile,
over here,

15:19.452 --> 15:24.355
It's time
for our creepiest,
scariest story yet,

15:24.357 --> 15:27.358
- Because this story's about...
-    <i>( thuds )</i>

15:27.360 --> 15:29.560
Bedtime.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.329
Can I sleep
with you guys?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.264
- Nope.
- We've decided it's time

15:33.266 --> 15:36.200
For you to learn
to sleep all by yourself.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.169
This story's about...

15:38.171 --> 15:39.837
( emphatically ) me.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.508
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.746
<i>( creaking )</i>

15:51.517 --> 15:54.819
- Mommy!
- Yes?

15:54.821 --> 15:58.389
You're not gonna eat
my Halloween candy, are you?

15:59.358 --> 16:01.326
Why would I do that?

16:02.394 --> 16:04.595
Maybe I should stay up
with you to make sure.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.198
You've gotta grow out
of this phase, bud.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.868
And your Halloween candy
is in a very good place.

16:14.239 --> 16:17.175

Hello.

There's a monster
under my bed.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.288
A monster?!
Let's see here.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.858
No, no monsters here,

Just a lot of toys.

Come here, bud.
Let's get you
into bed, okay?

16:38.298 --> 16:40.331
Come on,

Good night, bud.

Great.
All right, mr. Googly,

17:02.956 --> 17:04.288
I'm counting on you.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.324
You tell any monsters
under my bed

17:06.326 --> 17:08.226
To go away!

17:14.400 --> 17:15.666
Hey!

17:20.939 --> 17:22.640
What the...?

mr. Googly!

17:32.217 --> 17:36.587
I need to see
that mr. Googly's okay.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.963
Okay, here we go.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.441
Oh, mr. Googly,
I missed you.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.810
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

17:58.812 --> 18:01.546
Oh, mr. Blobbity,
I missed you.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.449
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.551
I would never
hurt anybody.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.486
Neither would
I hurt anybody.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.955
- Then why are you scaring me?
- No, you're scaring me!

18:10.957 --> 18:12.957
- No, you're scaring me!
- No, you're scaring me!

18:12.959 --> 18:15.793
- No, you're scaring me!
- No, you are!

18:15.795 --> 18:17.795
No, you are!

18:21.433 --> 18:24.635
- You okay?
- I'm very scared.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.271
But you're the monster
under the bed.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.740
You're the monster
over the bed.

18:31.376 --> 18:35.046
- I'm auggie.
- I'm simon p. Littleboyeater.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.016
That's not good.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.788
You can call me simon.
Hello!

18:43.790 --> 18:46.991
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

18:48.994 --> 18:51.896
- What's wrong?
- ( whispering )
daddy, monster.  Monster.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.931
( whispers )
under the bed?  Okay.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.800
Auggie,
there's nothing there.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.935
I promise.
There's nothing
under the bed.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.705
- But he was.
- Honey, look how tight

19:00.707 --> 19:02.140
We're gonna
tuck you in, okay?

19:02.142 --> 19:05.977
Yeah, this is our best
monster-proof tuck job.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.514
Absolutely.
No monsters are
getting in there, boy.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.949
- I wouldn't think so.
- Good night.  Love you.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.351
Good night.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.329
Mr. Littleboyeater?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.998
Yes?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.701
You can't just go around
living under people's beds.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.771
Excuse me?!
That's my home.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.707
How long have
you been there?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.109
Every night.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.044
I knew it!

19:40.046 --> 19:41.946
Yeah, you were right.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.115
So why can't
I ever see you?

19:44.117 --> 19:47.685
Because I'm really good
at what I do.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.754
- ( growls )
- ( laughs )

19:50.822 --> 19:52.390
So why can I see you now?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.492
Because I wanna
say goodbye.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.893
You're leaving?

19:57.496 --> 19:58.996
But why?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.032
Are you scared
of me anymore?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.934
No, you're my friend now.

20:02.936 --> 20:04.869
I'm not allowed
to have friends.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.872
- Why not?
- Because I'm a monster.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.114
- What's this?
- All the stuff
you thought you lost.

20:17.116 --> 20:21.052
- You're playing with them?
- During the day while
you're at school.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.154
I want you to have 'em.

20:23.156 --> 20:26.457
Really? Thanks!

20:27.693 --> 20:29.560
But why do you
have to go now?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.929
Because you're
a little boy,

20:31.931 --> 20:33.898
And you know what happens
to little boys?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.033
- What?
- They grow up!

20:37.703 --> 20:39.136
- Hey, monster.
- Yes?

20:39.138 --> 20:40.905
( gurgling sounds )

20:40.907 --> 20:43.040
Pretty good.

20:46.678 --> 20:49.113
- You okay, auggie?
- We're fine.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.082
Remember me.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.986
Not scared anymore,
auggie?

20:54.988 --> 20:57.021
No, nothing to be
scared of at all.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.889
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.558
Good night.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.194
- ( door closes )
- good night.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.804

tonight.

21:13.806 --> 21:14.939
I hope all of you who are

21:14.941 --> 21:16.440
Afraid of something

21:16.442 --> 21:18.542
Have learned that sometimes
things

21:18.544 --> 21:20.077
Are not as scary as they seem.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.680
Halloween only comes once
a year.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.914
Maybe next year

21:23.916 --> 21:25.983
I'll spend it at your house.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.655
Trick or treat!
