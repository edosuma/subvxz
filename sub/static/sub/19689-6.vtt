02:30.303 --> 02:34.171
Way each of us see the world
be affected by two things...

02:36.754 --> 02:38.501
...what we know...

02:39.527 --> 02:41.345
and what we believe.

02:43.756 --> 02:45.798
The first thing I knew...

02:48.369 --> 02:50.688
...was to be afraid of the white man.

02:53.086 --> 02:55.860
To be terrified
of them carryin' me away.

02:58.471 --> 03:01.699
I had two sisters carried away
in a chain gang.

03:05.614 --> 03:09.240
Could barely walk when the
first one, Mariah, was taken.

03:14.077 --> 03:17.322
I was too young to understand

03:17.357 --> 03:19.617
how someone could just disappear.

03:22.352 --> 03:25.423
But I wasn't too young
to feel my momma's grief.

03:28.343 --> 03:31.529
It's clawed at that emptiness
as long as I can remember.

03:34.732 --> 03:37.301
And that's shaped my fear of white men.

03:46.795 --> 03:49.213
And it ain't gone away in all my years.

03:53.403 --> 03:55.136
So imagine how I must feel

03:55.171 --> 03:57.672
starin' out at all of y'all right now.

04:08.765 --> 04:10.735
I grew up like a neglected weed.

04:15.659 --> 04:17.137
Ignorant of liberty,

04:18.862 --> 04:20.945
havin' no experience of it.

04:24.834 --> 04:28.167
Then I was not happy or contented.

04:30.707 --> 04:32.040
And now I been free,

04:32.075 --> 04:35.721
I know what a dreadful condition
slavery is.

04:42.705 --> 04:46.253
I imagine a lot of y'all done
come across <i> Uncle Tom's Cabin?</i>

04:50.660 --> 04:52.694
I've heard it read, and I tell you,

04:52.729 --> 04:55.530
Ms. Stowe's pen hasn't begun
to paint what slavery is

04:55.565 --> 04:58.055
as I've seen it in the far South.

05:00.609 --> 05:02.626
It's the next thing to hell.

05:06.449 --> 05:09.666
If a person would send another
into bondage,

05:11.450 --> 05:12.980
he would, it appears to me,

05:13.016 --> 05:15.638
be bad enough to send him
to hell, if he could.

05:22.659 --> 05:25.143
But I suppose
y'all share that sentiment.

05:26.329 --> 05:28.039
That's why you're here.

05:29.499 --> 05:31.414
We of like mind.

05:34.371 --> 05:35.837
What y'all really came to hear

05:36.342 --> 05:39.670
is how I defied all the odds
and escaped hell.

05:46.696 --> 05:49.222
To tell you how I came to be free,

05:50.926 --> 05:52.998
first you got to understand

05:54.524 --> 05:58.126
what bondage was like for me.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.597
How it attacks the senses.

06:05.394 --> 06:06.870
The sound of it.

06:08.471 --> 06:11.086
The crack of a whip like thunder.

06:13.743 --> 06:14.982
The feel of it.

06:18.448 --> 06:21.792
Like you could
barely take a full breath.

06:25.722 --> 06:29.957
The taste of it, like all
your teeth made of copper.

06:31.828 --> 06:33.217
The smell of it.

06:34.998 --> 06:38.436
The fadin' stench
of everybody sold away.

06:42.338 --> 06:43.713
And the look of it.

06:48.813 --> 06:51.114
Every eye turned down to the ground,

06:53.750 --> 06:55.134
away from the horror.

07:02.659 --> 07:05.234
There were nobody better
at turnin' an eye

07:06.196 --> 07:08.236
than the real Harriet, my momma.

07:09.436 --> 07:11.032
She worked up in the house,

07:11.067 --> 07:14.108
and she was well-versed
in the way of white folks.

07:15.505 --> 07:17.660
How to judge they moods,

07:17.695 --> 07:20.405
how to move through they space
like a spirit,

07:22.111 --> 07:24.679
how to listen and remember secrets

07:24.714 --> 07:26.046
that might be of use later.

07:27.484 --> 07:30.118
Her lessons would be helpful
once I started movin' cargo,

07:30.153 --> 07:35.005
but in the meantime,
I had no use for it.

07:35.658 --> 07:39.523
The last place I wanted to be
was workin' in the house.

07:40.697 --> 07:42.666
But from the moment I could work,

07:43.900 --> 07:45.865
that's where I found myself.

07:47.904 --> 07:51.405
I wasn't no taller than
them chairs y'all sittin' in

07:51.708 --> 07:55.322
when Mr. Cooks came on his horse
one mornin' and took me away.

07:56.479 --> 07:59.714
My massa had hired me out
to him and his wife.

07:59.749 --> 08:03.786
And she was keen
on teachin' me to weave for her.

08:04.842 --> 08:06.821
Problem is my little hands

08:06.856 --> 08:08.890
just wouldn't take
to that woman's lesson,

08:08.925 --> 08:11.074
no matter how hard she nagged.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.539
And she nagged.

08:13.199 --> 08:15.398
"Come on, little nig!
Get that needle through!

08:15.433 --> 08:17.251
"Kick them legs out, you little nig!

08:17.286 --> 08:18.533
Work that loom!"

08:18.568 --> 08:19.634
She would give herself a headache,

08:19.670 --> 08:22.724
but I could never seem to manage it.

08:24.941 --> 08:27.341
Some might say
that was under my own design,

08:27.377 --> 08:28.802
but you'll never hear me say that.

08:30.131 --> 08:31.162
Soon enough,

08:31.197 --> 08:33.552
the mistress got tired
of tryin' to teach me,

08:34.250 --> 08:37.919
and Mr. Cooks tasked me
with checkin' the muskrat traps.

08:38.414 --> 08:39.986
Mm, that's right,

08:40.023 --> 08:42.885
somebody know
how terrible a job that be.

08:44.059 --> 08:47.562
But I was workin' under God's roof,

08:47.597 --> 08:50.022
and that's... that's what I preferred.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.302
My body had other preferences.

08:54.337 --> 08:58.072
I got real sick
movin' through them swamps.

08:58.107 --> 09:00.474
Sick enough
that Mr. Cooks sent me back home

09:00.510 --> 09:02.243
after my momma done complain to massa

09:02.278 --> 09:05.079
that I be dead without no lookin' after.

09:05.114 --> 09:07.748
And a dead slave ain't worth nothin'.

09:08.214 --> 09:12.920
I remember thinkin' then
that my momma had won.

09:15.391 --> 09:17.046
That maybe that victory,

09:18.061 --> 09:19.529
no matter how small,

09:20.823 --> 09:22.125
was freedom.

09:26.235 --> 09:28.064
I was soon reminded...

09:29.018 --> 09:30.798
and I constantly would be...

09:32.175 --> 09:34.508
that there ain't
no such thing as triumph

09:34.544 --> 09:36.566
under the conditions of slavery.

09:39.326 --> 09:41.349
Just respite.

09:55.604 --> 09:57.904
Black folk, we know pain.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.612
Known it a long time.

10:03.278 --> 10:06.480
I got more scars on my body
than I can count.

10:07.799 --> 10:10.411
Miss Susan, the next woman
I was hired out to,

10:10.446 --> 10:12.548
she gave me a lot of 'em.

10:13.149 --> 10:16.617
The first day, she told me to
dust and sweep the great room.

10:16.653 --> 10:19.053
No instruction. She just
pushed the broom in my hand

10:19.088 --> 10:20.213
and left me to work.

10:21.024 --> 10:23.724
And when she returned, she
wasn't happy with what she saw,

10:23.760 --> 10:25.426
so she took a rawhide and...

10:29.078 --> 10:30.830
She had me come at it again.

10:31.801 --> 10:34.235
No word 'bout what I done wrong.

10:34.270 --> 10:36.671
I tried my best
to collect every piece of dust.

10:36.706 --> 10:39.941
Even had that thing in my hand,
dusting my own blood.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.829
But when she returned...

10:49.318 --> 10:51.751
I took up that broom once more...

10:53.556 --> 10:55.101
and then again...

11:02.383 --> 11:04.432
I never cried out once.

11:06.114 --> 11:08.465
I wouldn't give Miss Susan
the satisfaction.

11:10.339 --> 11:12.920
That's how I learned to love the pain.

11:14.510 --> 11:16.473
Every time I got hit,

11:17.680 --> 11:19.655
I took it as an opportunity.

11:20.937 --> 11:22.617
For defiance.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.472
To not give anyone
the reaction they expected.

11:29.831 --> 11:32.754
And then I thought, again,

11:34.197 --> 11:36.207
maybe that there was freedom.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.310
But I couldn't reconcile

11:41.637 --> 11:44.447
why somethin' everybody held so precious

11:45.374 --> 11:47.072
come from pain.

11:48.511 --> 11:51.144
There had to be
an easier way to it than that.

11:57.386 --> 11:58.648
One mornin',

11:59.922 --> 12:04.625
Miss Susan and her husband
got into a ugly screamin' match.

12:04.660 --> 12:07.605
While they scream and scream,
I just wait.

12:09.298 --> 12:12.108
My eyes glued on a bowl on the table.

12:14.844 --> 12:16.704
You know what was in it?

12:20.076 --> 12:22.510
Lumps of pure white sugar.

12:24.013 --> 12:26.680
When the mistress' back was turned,

12:26.716 --> 12:28.949
I move real slow.

12:31.420 --> 12:34.262
Reached my hand
right into that sugar bowl.

12:35.591 --> 12:38.993
Took just one lump.

12:39.028 --> 12:40.661
And that old bat must've heard me,

12:40.696 --> 12:42.997
'cause she had the rawhide down,
comin' at me like a storm,

12:43.032 --> 12:45.966
but I gave one jump
out that door, and I flew!

12:46.002 --> 12:47.468
I ran, and I ran.

12:47.503 --> 12:49.003
Sugar meltin' on my tongue.

12:49.038 --> 12:50.604
Nothin' ain't taste so good in my life.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.139
I ran. I ain't know where I was goin'.

12:52.175 --> 12:53.941
I ain't had nowhere to go,
but it didn't matter

12:53.976 --> 12:55.276
in that moment.

12:55.311 --> 12:58.245
'Cause I had just stolen
what joy I could, and that,

12:58.281 --> 13:01.649
that, that felt like freedom!

13:07.087 --> 13:08.821
If you'd asked anybody

13:09.592 --> 13:11.055
about little Minty...

13:12.161 --> 13:14.270
that's what they called me back then...

13:14.830 --> 13:16.103
they'd have told you.

13:18.126 --> 13:21.361
I was the most rebellious thing.

13:21.604 --> 13:23.208
Mischievous, too.

13:24.326 --> 13:26.234
And I took pride in that.

13:27.410 --> 13:31.424
Knowin' they ain't own me in spirit.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.544
And maybe that's
how I ought to have ended up,

13:37.046 --> 13:39.605
findin' freedom on the edges,

13:40.857 --> 13:42.685
were it not for that one thing.

13:43.659 --> 13:45.830
See, there be things
that happen in your life.

13:46.429 --> 13:48.494
If you're lucky, maybe only one thing.

13:49.065 --> 13:51.917
Somethin' that splits your life in two.

13:53.069 --> 13:55.606
A before and a after.

13:56.239 --> 13:58.439
I'm sure most of y'all done heard

13:58.474 --> 14:02.142
this scar got somethin' to do
with my spells.

14:02.178 --> 14:05.412
How it is I just nod off

14:05.448 --> 14:07.454
in the middle of a sentence...

14:10.953 --> 14:12.453
...and start right back up again.

14:14.123 --> 14:17.157
I done heard all the stories
about how I came about it.

14:17.193 --> 14:20.995
That I fell 50 feet off a cliff
'fore I climbed my way back up.

14:21.447 --> 14:22.630
That I took a bullet

14:22.665 --> 14:25.799
from a catcher on the outskirts
of a Kentucky farm.

14:25.835 --> 14:29.904
That I fought off six men, armed
with hammers, to a standstill.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.571
Truth be told...

14:33.965 --> 14:36.244
I was worried about my hair.

14:37.894 --> 14:39.894
It's the truth. It wasn't never combed.

14:39.919 --> 14:41.785
Stood out like a bushel basket.

14:42.118 --> 14:45.119
It was so bad, I would take
the grease on my fingers

14:45.154 --> 14:47.421
after dinner
and wipe it across my forehead,

14:47.456 --> 14:49.402
tryin' to tame the wildness.

14:52.161 --> 14:54.497
That's what I remember most
about that day.

14:55.850 --> 14:59.408
I was fussin' with my hair in
the front window of the store,

14:59.443 --> 15:02.211
too ashamed to go in lookin' like I did,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.280
when out of nowhere,

15:04.315 --> 15:07.983
I see a white man chasin' after
one of his rebellious slaves.

15:08.019 --> 15:09.818
And I see his massa raise his hand

15:09.854 --> 15:12.321
to throw a heavy iron weight
at that slave,

15:12.356 --> 15:13.518
and...

15:14.626 --> 15:16.508
I don't remember anything after that.

15:18.996 --> 15:21.730
They told me it struck me in my head.

15:23.013 --> 15:26.743
That's when my "after" started.

15:29.273 --> 15:30.974
In my spells,

15:32.936 --> 15:34.622
my spirit would go travelin',

15:36.867 --> 15:39.150
flyin' to distant lands.

15:42.065 --> 15:45.499
And I heard a voice of someone speakin'

15:45.524 --> 15:48.725
in the language of the old
prophets in its grand flow.

15:48.859 --> 15:50.492
And I didn't understand it at first.

15:50.528 --> 15:52.047
I didn't know what to make of it.

15:52.763 --> 15:54.681
But then I came to understand

15:55.726 --> 15:57.320
it was the voice of Him.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.600
The bringer of all good things.

16:02.873 --> 16:05.574
He was showin' me what was possible.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.811
I thought all my little acts of
defiance added up to somethin',

16:08.846 --> 16:10.512
but they ain't.

16:10.548 --> 16:13.366
And all them people callin' me a rebel

16:14.151 --> 16:16.544
was just as lost as I was.

16:18.488 --> 16:21.608
There ain't no negotiations on freedom.

16:23.127 --> 16:24.912
I was spendin' all my time

16:25.642 --> 16:27.721
knowin' things
instead of believin' them.

16:28.478 --> 16:31.873
And that's the first step
to truly being free.

16:34.071 --> 16:37.592
When you can see past
all the things that you know

16:39.056 --> 16:40.808
and believe in somethin' better.

16:43.047 --> 16:44.389
It ain't easy.

16:45.916 --> 16:48.041
But that's the work that must be done.

16:50.788 --> 16:54.071
I was finally on my way to bein'
what everybody accused me of.

16:56.794 --> 16:58.727
I was ready to be a rebel.

17:06.676 --> 17:09.243
Funny thing is, just
'cause you believe somethin'

17:09.280 --> 17:11.747
don't mean anybody else ready to.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.252
What my scar look like to you?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.156
A bird?

17:21.192 --> 17:23.492
That's what I always thought, too.

17:23.527 --> 17:26.295
And after that day in the store,
durin' my spells,

17:26.329 --> 17:29.264
I would always be dreamin' 'bout flyin'.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.066
Way up high.

17:31.279 --> 17:33.719
So high I could almost touch the sun.

17:34.271 --> 17:37.873
Just soarin' over fields and-and towns

17:37.908 --> 17:40.221
and rivers and mountains.

17:40.703 --> 17:45.644
I believed I was supposed
to be as free as a bird.

17:47.067 --> 17:51.330
But I still knew I wasn't.

17:53.691 --> 17:56.425
I'd gotten a small measure of it
by convincin' my massa

17:56.460 --> 17:58.601
to let me hire myself out.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.797
Find my own work on my own time.

18:02.177 --> 18:03.966
My daddy was a timber inspector.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.268
And like old Sojourner,

18:06.303 --> 18:09.218
I could work just as hard as any man.

18:10.241 --> 18:12.674
Even found myself one to marry.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.507
John Tubman.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.847
All that gave me some small
comfort for some time,

18:18.883 --> 18:20.955
till I fell sick one winter,

18:21.485 --> 18:23.122
which I sometimes do.

18:24.388 --> 18:28.857
And when Massa Stewart got word,
he started lookin' to sell me,

18:28.893 --> 18:30.626
as he sometimes do.

18:31.098 --> 18:35.564
So from Christmas till March,
I worked as I could,

18:35.599 --> 18:38.867
and I prayed
through all the long nights.

18:38.903 --> 18:41.962
I groaned and I prayed for ol' massa.

18:49.813 --> 18:51.179
"Oh, Lord,

18:52.116 --> 18:53.852
"convert massa.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.954
"Oh, Lord,

18:57.354 --> 18:59.164
change that man's heart."

19:00.172 --> 19:02.875
I prayed all day and night

19:03.661 --> 19:07.787
for a heart in my massa,
until the first of March.

19:08.652 --> 19:11.101
And all that time,
you know what he was doin'?

19:12.515 --> 19:14.703
He was still tryin' to sell me.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.684
So I changed my prayer.

19:21.404 --> 19:24.321
"Oh, Lord, if you ain't never
gonna change that man's heart,

19:27.211 --> 19:29.651
then kill him, Lord,
and take him out the way."

19:35.659 --> 19:38.327
Not a week passed, and massa was dead.

19:38.802 --> 19:43.001
Died just like he lived,
an old bad and wicked man.

19:44.778 --> 19:47.602
I'd give all the world
full of gold, if I had it,

19:47.638 --> 19:50.361
to bring that poor soul back. I would.

19:51.909 --> 19:54.321
But I could pray for him no longer.

19:55.609 --> 19:58.013
'Cause I knew then that the Lord
wasn't just speakin' to me,

19:58.048 --> 20:00.649
He was listenin'.
This be a conversation.

20:01.122 --> 20:03.740
And I knew he was prepared
to give me anything I needed,

20:03.775 --> 20:05.654
and I ain't want to waste it,
not on no man

20:05.689 --> 20:07.289
who ain't deserve it or on myself,

20:07.324 --> 20:09.224
'cause of the guilt weighin' my soul.

20:09.928 --> 20:11.626
You have to be intentional
with your aim,

20:11.662 --> 20:14.088
'cause he will provide.

20:15.699 --> 20:19.434
And from that moment on,
I knew what my intention was.

20:21.338 --> 20:23.520
I aimed to escape.

20:25.943 --> 20:28.192
Now, I knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

20:29.380 --> 20:32.629
The backwoods of Maryland
be uneven and hard goin'.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.083
And after massa's death,
everybody was scared.

20:35.119 --> 20:36.910
That's how it is in the South.

20:37.679 --> 20:40.218
A white planter's death
always comes with sells.

20:40.253 --> 20:42.824
And since me and my brother
was already lined up

20:42.860 --> 20:45.060
and massa's debts was bein' called in,

20:45.095 --> 20:47.396
the mistress was lookin'
for somethin' easy.

20:47.431 --> 20:50.766
So I believed we had to go then and now.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.267
But what I say earlier?

20:52.302 --> 20:53.769
Just 'cause you believe somethin'

20:53.804 --> 20:56.238
don't mean anybody else ready to.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.740
My brothers had their doubts.

20:59.267 --> 21:01.251
So I convinced 'em to run.

21:04.982 --> 21:07.275
That was my first mistake.

21:11.055 --> 21:12.847
It was a Saturday night.

21:14.111 --> 21:15.891
Ain't nobody be watchin' you on His day.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.767
You could get a good head start.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.310
But the moon was
shinin' bright that night.

21:23.187 --> 21:24.666
With our long shadows,

21:24.701 --> 21:27.390
looked like eight of us
was runnin' 'stead of four.

21:28.607 --> 21:30.105
We ain't gone but a mile,

21:30.140 --> 21:32.974
and them boys start arguing
over which way to go.

21:33.010 --> 21:35.190
One say this way,
the other say that way.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.279
And next thing I knew,

21:37.314 --> 21:39.423
them boys was talkin' 'bout
turnin' around.

21:40.117 --> 21:43.064
Ain't but a mile,
and they was ready to give up.

21:44.783 --> 21:47.567
I meant to keep on,
but they dragged me back.

21:49.326 --> 21:53.495
And that was the last time
I convinced anybody to run.

21:54.161 --> 21:56.798
That freedom fire, that ain't somethin'

21:56.834 --> 22:00.235
that can be stoked in someone else.

22:00.270 --> 22:02.007
And embers ain't enough.

22:03.807 --> 22:07.209
I seen a wildfire once
when I was younger.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.578
I stood right at the edge of it
with my daddy.

22:09.613 --> 22:11.546
I stared at it for a long time,

22:11.582 --> 22:14.082
and still I barely got the words
to describe it.

22:14.118 --> 22:16.485
The heat, the hum of activity,

22:16.520 --> 22:18.854
the relentless power
of them flames consumin'

22:18.889 --> 22:20.455
everything in its path.

22:20.491 --> 22:23.892
That's how you got to burn
for freedom... wild-like,

22:23.927 --> 22:26.995
ready to scorch any doubt in your path.

22:27.030 --> 22:28.919
'Cause that's what it's gonna take.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.934
My brothers didn't have it,
not yet, but I did.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.203
And wasn't nobody gonna stop me
at that point.

22:35.239 --> 22:38.265
This time, I was gonna go at it alone.

22:38.976 --> 22:40.675
Well, that-that ain't exactly true.

22:40.711 --> 22:42.844
I-I spoke to Miss Leverton.

22:43.102 --> 22:45.680
Her husband owned the mill nearby,

22:46.023 --> 22:48.283
and they were known abolitionists.

22:48.629 --> 22:50.752
I asked for her help,
and she gave me directions

22:50.787 --> 22:52.638
to the first safe house on my journey.

22:55.526 --> 22:59.639
But that first step
off the plantation...

23:08.968 --> 23:10.872
...that'd just be me.

23:19.183 --> 23:21.215
I walked out into the unknown,

23:23.320 --> 23:26.054
heading to a place
I'd only heard about in stories:

23:26.089 --> 23:27.573
Pennsylvania.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.893
I wish I could say nothing's
harder than that first step,

23:31.929 --> 23:36.064
but... all of them be hard.

23:37.800 --> 23:42.002
I made my way along creek beds,
pickin' waterways over roads,

23:42.027 --> 23:44.527
followin' the North Star
when I could see it,

23:44.813 --> 23:48.030
taking help all along the way
whenever it was given.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.111
I got through Maryland with ease,

23:50.147 --> 23:52.045
Delaware with a little less.

23:52.950 --> 23:56.710
I listened to the Lord's voice
guidin' me,

23:57.487 --> 23:59.894
protectin' me from danger.

24:00.991 --> 24:05.157
When it was near,
it would always come...

24:06.330 --> 24:08.246
like a flutter in my heart.

24:09.607 --> 24:11.941
I knew he wouldn't lead me astray.

24:17.975 --> 24:20.175
And then, finally...

24:22.079 --> 24:24.045
...I crossed the line.

24:29.119 --> 24:32.015
I was in Pennsylvania.

24:42.199 --> 24:44.478
I looked at my hands...

24:47.771 --> 24:49.721
...see if I was the same person.

24:53.377 --> 24:56.183
There was such a glory over everything.

24:57.814 --> 25:01.883
The sun come like gold through the trees

25:01.918 --> 25:03.151
and over the fields.

25:03.186 --> 25:05.270
I felt like I was in heaven.

25:05.305 --> 25:06.988
I had crossed the line.

25:07.024 --> 25:08.506
I...

25:09.293 --> 25:10.588
I was free.

25:19.336 --> 25:23.381
But there was no one to welcome
me to the land of freedom.

25:25.876 --> 25:29.411
I was a stranger in a strange land.

25:33.550 --> 25:37.578
My home, after all,
was down in Maryland,

25:38.590 --> 25:41.890
'cause my father and mother,

25:41.925 --> 25:44.726
brothers and sisters and friends
was all there.

25:44.761 --> 25:47.128
But I was free. And they should be free.

25:47.164 --> 25:48.334
I believe that.

25:49.301 --> 25:51.766
I'd make a home in the North

25:51.802 --> 25:53.768
and bring 'em there, God helpin' me.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.170
Oh, I prayed then.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.646
I said, "Lord,

25:57.641 --> 26:00.223
"I'm-a hold steady on to you,

26:01.445 --> 26:04.190
and I know you'll see me through."

26:07.598 --> 26:09.272
I was goin' back.

26:10.554 --> 26:13.054
By the time I did, the activity...

26:13.525 --> 26:15.857
the activity in the capital
had shifted the ground

26:15.892 --> 26:17.405
from under us.

26:20.897 --> 26:24.326
And nowhere was safe
in these United States

26:25.135 --> 26:26.710
for me or mine.

26:41.831 --> 26:45.466
Mr. Douglass could always speak
on the Fugitive Slave Act,

26:45.502 --> 26:48.685
the Bloodhound Law, better than I could.

26:50.367 --> 26:51.629
He'd say something like...

26:54.277 --> 26:57.541
"Your lawmakers from up high

26:58.748 --> 27:01.816
"have commanded
all good citizens to engage

27:01.851 --> 27:04.949
"in this hellish sport
where the fugitive slave

27:05.355 --> 27:07.255
is but game."

27:07.657 --> 27:08.956
Any of y'all know him,

27:08.992 --> 27:10.892
don't you dare tell Fred I did this.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.897
He'd chastise me at our next meetin'.

27:18.234 --> 27:22.070
"There isn't anywhere safe
in these United States

27:22.105 --> 27:24.055
"for the fugitive slave.

27:24.541 --> 27:28.309
"The whole armory of Northern
law has no shield for you.

27:28.345 --> 27:32.580
"In fact, the point of its sword
is at your neck."

27:36.386 --> 27:37.814
He right.

27:38.655 --> 27:40.562
This law change everything.

27:41.478 --> 27:43.992
Wasn't no more solid ground to stand on.

27:44.627 --> 27:46.621
Not but a year after I escape.

27:47.430 --> 27:48.582
A year.

27:49.265 --> 27:51.014
Felt like longer.

27:51.735 --> 27:55.136
I had a terrible ache
where family should have been.

27:55.171 --> 27:57.905
It felt like I had fallen
into that empty space

27:57.941 --> 27:59.648
my momma's grief clawed at.

28:00.276 --> 28:03.511
I took her name to keep her close

28:03.546 --> 28:07.382
and to become the woman
that swept floors and cooked.

28:08.918 --> 28:10.159
Housework,

28:10.184 --> 28:12.518
or domestic work as they call it
here in the North,

28:12.789 --> 28:15.156
I... I took it any way I could find it.

28:15.191 --> 28:16.824
Can you believe that?

28:16.860 --> 28:18.893
I ran all the way North

28:18.928 --> 28:22.124
to become the very thing
I ran so hard from as a child.

28:22.504 --> 28:24.399
But that's the way of it...
sometimes you got to

28:24.434 --> 28:28.403
circle back on it
to see how different you be.

28:28.438 --> 28:29.972
And it was different.

28:30.607 --> 28:33.935
Knowin' I ain't had no rawhide
on the mantle waitin' for me,

28:34.511 --> 28:36.944
I swept and dusted

28:36.980 --> 28:39.197
with a glad heart and a willin' hand.

28:39.649 --> 28:41.382
It be the first work

28:41.418 --> 28:43.894
where the reward be entirely my own.

28:44.714 --> 28:48.465
Ain't no massa with an open hand
to rob me of it.

28:49.659 --> 28:53.889
But the most important thing
was I had a purpose:

28:55.298 --> 28:58.559
to get my kin out of bondage.

29:00.069 --> 29:01.865
By any means.

29:04.873 --> 29:08.145
Ain't nothin' can't be endured
when you got a purpose.

29:09.345 --> 29:13.132
I'd dust every inch of the North
if it'll help me rescue mine.

29:15.185 --> 29:17.145
And that's what I set out to do.

29:17.654 --> 29:20.123
In every hotel and home
that would have me.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.257
At the time,

29:23.293 --> 29:26.627
I didn't know where to begin
my pursuit to rescue my kin,

29:26.663 --> 29:28.980
but I knew I'd need money
to pull it off.

29:29.939 --> 29:31.441
And I'd need a plan.

29:33.036 --> 29:35.793
My own escape was too impulsive.

29:36.537 --> 29:39.106
It was a risk worth takin'
when it was just my life,

29:39.142 --> 29:41.328
but it wouldn't stand
when it come to others.

29:44.547 --> 29:46.217
I'd need a route back.

29:47.484 --> 29:50.318
And somewhere in the middle
of a most hostile territory

29:50.353 --> 29:54.248
to hole up in while I got word
to my kin somehow.

29:54.624 --> 29:56.881
And all that's just the gettin' there.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.329
'Member how I said earlier?

30:00.310 --> 30:01.650
He will provide?

30:03.700 --> 30:05.008
He will.

30:06.035 --> 30:08.137
But you got to do your part.

30:17.193 --> 30:19.054
So I began a pattern

30:20.143 --> 30:23.011
that I would repeat
for many years after.

30:25.034 --> 30:28.233
Workin', plannin',

30:28.858 --> 30:32.152
and waitin' on the dark months.

30:32.729 --> 30:35.834
December, January, February.

30:36.366 --> 30:38.432
The nights are longer,

30:38.468 --> 30:42.737
and the chill got most huddled
by the fire inside they homes.

30:43.191 --> 30:44.372
That's the time

30:44.407 --> 30:47.183
when you can slip
across state lines unseen.

30:48.511 --> 30:50.463
And I'd acquainted myself

30:50.947 --> 30:54.115
with the black folks workin'
the boatyard along the Delaware.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.384
They kept me in contact
with the eastern shore.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.319
I'd need to know the coming and going

30:58.354 --> 31:00.169
if I was lookin' to come and go.

31:01.391 --> 31:05.760
It was through a bondsman
in that boatyard that I got word

31:05.973 --> 31:08.563
my niece Kessiah and her chillun

31:08.598 --> 31:11.536
were being set to be sold on the
steps of the county courthouse.

31:15.738 --> 31:17.629
I went to Baltimore straightaway

31:18.274 --> 31:20.241
so I could better communicate
with Mr. Bowley.

31:20.276 --> 31:22.009
That was Kessiah's husband.

31:22.422 --> 31:26.213
Bein' a freeman, he could bid
on the family at auction.

31:28.124 --> 31:29.907
The day of the auction came.

31:31.721 --> 31:33.927
I was 100 miles away in Baltimore.

31:35.412 --> 31:36.783
Prayin'.

31:38.194 --> 31:39.175
Waitin'.

31:40.279 --> 31:43.328
The dread I felt that day
was somethin' powerful.

31:47.303 --> 31:49.070
Though that rescue was successful,

31:49.105 --> 31:50.271
and the one after that,

31:51.174 --> 31:53.841
I knew I couldn't sit back anymore

31:53.876 --> 31:55.656
and pull strings from afar.

31:56.973 --> 31:58.662
Too many things could go wrong.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.782
I'd have to go all the way back.

32:01.818 --> 32:03.250
That'd be the best chance.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.419
And yes, I was scared.

32:06.060 --> 32:08.513
But I started with this idea in my head.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.575
There's two things I got a right to:

32:14.897 --> 32:15.832
death...

32:17.567 --> 32:18.525
or liberty.

32:20.637 --> 32:23.711
One or the other I mean to have.

32:25.541 --> 32:29.160
No one will take me back alive.

32:30.566 --> 32:33.561
I shall fight for my liberty.

32:34.817 --> 32:37.559
And when the time come for me to go,

32:39.255 --> 32:41.231
the Lord will let them kill me.

32:45.728 --> 32:49.864
So I set about preparin' to head back

32:50.566 --> 32:52.463
for the first time.

32:55.131 --> 32:56.431
To a place I'd call home

32:56.456 --> 32:59.080
as long as any of my kin
still live there.

32:59.942 --> 33:01.465
My singular aim:

33:03.287 --> 33:05.143
to bring my husband back.

33:08.191 --> 33:11.318
I decided I'd take a boat
down the Chesapeake,

33:11.354 --> 33:14.039
retracin' the route
my niece's family had taken.

33:14.590 --> 33:17.858
I'd holed up 'bout eight miles
from Caroline County,

33:17.894 --> 33:19.255
where I'd lived with John.

33:20.135 --> 33:22.064
Now, I wouldn't go to him.

33:22.899 --> 33:24.965
I decided I'd send word
with someone I could trust

33:25.001 --> 33:27.374
and let him know
I'd come to take him North

33:27.409 --> 33:28.669
and wait for him to come to me.

33:28.705 --> 33:30.404
That was the safest way
I could figure it,

33:30.440 --> 33:31.905
and that way ain't failed me since.

33:41.084 --> 33:44.285
There ain't much
that surprises me these days.

33:46.289 --> 33:49.623
But findin' out John
had taken up with another woman

33:49.659 --> 33:51.317
in my absence...

33:54.290 --> 33:55.666
...that was hard.

33:58.801 --> 34:01.469
Hearin' that they was livin'
as man and wife

34:01.504 --> 34:03.459
in the same home we had.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.674
Knowin' I'd come all that way for him,

34:06.709 --> 34:09.107
and he refused to come back with me.

34:16.212 --> 34:17.467
I was hurt.

34:19.388 --> 34:20.764
I was angry.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.043
And jealous.

34:26.661 --> 34:30.130
I wanted to run to
his house... my house...

34:30.166 --> 34:32.225
and make all the trouble I could.

34:36.359 --> 34:39.835
But how foolish it was just for
temper to make mischief.

34:42.678 --> 34:45.554
If he could do without me,
I could do without him.

34:47.436 --> 34:50.083
And just like that,
he dropped from my heart.

34:50.119 --> 34:52.799
But the Lord had a reason
for that betrayal.

34:53.688 --> 34:56.056
He was tryin' to show me somethin'.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.587
That I was thinkin' too small.

34:59.084 --> 35:00.427
While I was waitin' for John,

35:00.463 --> 35:02.129
some others heard that I was there,

35:02.165 --> 35:04.323
and they had come to me
and asked me for my help.

35:05.001 --> 35:08.836
See, I'd only been thinkin'
about me and mine.

35:08.871 --> 35:10.943
And that ain't good enough, not for him.

35:11.895 --> 35:15.947
I had the means
to help those who came to me.

35:16.912 --> 35:19.595
And so help I would.

35:21.259 --> 35:24.275
I led 11 souls to freedom that trip.

35:25.221 --> 35:27.221
Didn't stop in Philadelphia, either.

35:27.256 --> 35:29.356
Took 'em all the way to Canada West.

35:29.392 --> 35:30.858
The North wasn't safe no more.

35:30.893 --> 35:33.360
I couldn't trust my people
with Uncle Sam.

35:33.396 --> 35:35.683
The ground keep shiftin' beneath us.

35:36.732 --> 35:38.648
And so it was from then on.

35:39.867 --> 35:42.770
I wasn't married to no one
but the cause.

35:44.867 --> 35:47.274
I'd make another trip South.

35:47.310 --> 35:48.586
And another one.

35:49.045 --> 35:52.847
Always alertin'
other black folks to my presence

35:52.882 --> 35:54.782
by walkin' the back trails

35:54.817 --> 35:58.352
near the slave quarters, singin'.

36:52.976 --> 36:54.776
After folks heard that,

36:54.977 --> 36:57.738
word of where and when
I was headin' North

36:57.773 --> 36:58.937
would spread quickly.

36:58.973 --> 37:00.932
And I'd keep to it, no matter what.

37:01.217 --> 37:03.150
If you ain't there,
you was gon' be left behind.

37:03.185 --> 37:05.185
And I had my gun with me
so that anybody with me

37:05.221 --> 37:06.525
ain't turn back.

37:09.992 --> 37:13.084
I done led countless souls
in they flight to freedom.

37:13.829 --> 37:16.813
Each one a testament of the path
that he has shown me.

37:18.501 --> 37:21.611
And in his own time,
the giver of all good things

37:22.138 --> 37:23.600
give me what I want.

37:25.007 --> 37:27.875
The kin whose love
had been the only balm

37:27.910 --> 37:31.211
in my days of bondage be free now.

37:32.755 --> 37:36.357
I done got what I wanted.

37:39.355 --> 37:41.309
But maybe it ain't what I need.

37:45.227 --> 37:46.760
I know the work I do,

37:46.796 --> 37:49.893
th-that a lot of us do
in this room is important.

37:52.935 --> 37:55.461
But I'm startin' to believe
it ain't enough.

38:03.414 --> 38:06.882
That first day at Miss Susan's,

38:06.917 --> 38:08.650
takin' a beatin' and keepin' at it,

38:09.687 --> 38:11.862
she had me clean the parlor

38:12.456 --> 38:14.276
'cause her sister was comin' to call.

38:15.846 --> 38:17.484
Miss Emily was her name.

38:18.782 --> 38:21.930
And when she saw me barely standin',

38:22.359 --> 38:26.295
welts all up my arm, neck and face,

38:26.637 --> 38:29.555
somethin' must have broke
in her heart, just a little.

38:30.407 --> 38:31.762
She took pity on me.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.467
Told me what I was doin' wrong.

38:35.079 --> 38:39.195
See, I'd sweep,
then I'd dust right away.

38:39.837 --> 38:41.813
Wasn't givin' no time
for the dust to settle.

38:42.819 --> 38:45.498
So all my hard work was comin' undone.

38:47.892 --> 38:50.628
That's the way
I been feelin' these days.

38:52.229 --> 38:53.828
Can't get no sleep.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.900
And it ain't just my momma's complainin'

38:57.935 --> 39:00.340
about the Canadian cold
every night, either.

39:04.575 --> 39:06.216
When I do sleep...

39:08.892 --> 39:11.996
...there ain't no dreamin'
of flyin' no more.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.747
My feet be firmly planted on the ground.

39:16.353 --> 39:20.722
I'm always in a wilderness
sort of place, with...

39:20.758 --> 39:24.359
all full of,
full of rocks and-and bushes.

39:26.363 --> 39:29.566
And up from behind one of them
rocks, a serpent rises up.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.855
It don't scare me.
I just be standin' there.

39:33.571 --> 39:36.371
And as it rises higher and higher,

39:36.407 --> 39:38.907
its head becomes the head of a old man

39:38.943 --> 39:40.209
with a long white beard.

39:40.244 --> 39:42.678
I ain't got no idea who this man is,

39:42.713 --> 39:45.214
but he be gazin' at me wishful-like,

39:45.249 --> 39:49.084
as if he got somethin'
of grave importance to tell me.

39:49.119 --> 39:53.922
But he just can't,
he can't seem to form the words.

39:55.319 --> 39:58.879
And then two more heads
come out of his body.

40:00.431 --> 40:03.407
And those be the faces of younger men.

40:04.301 --> 40:06.114
I ain't know them, either.

40:07.264 --> 40:10.454
And that old man's eyes
hold steady onto me.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.271
What he want from me? I don't know.

40:15.679 --> 40:17.583
Then, out of nowhere,

40:18.328 --> 40:22.330
a crowd of men come out,
and they rush the serpent,

40:22.355 --> 40:24.388
and they strike down
the two younger heads

40:24.413 --> 40:25.879
and then the old man's.

40:25.904 --> 40:29.353
And still, I-I'm just
standin' there, watchin'.

40:31.795 --> 40:34.963
That old snake man's gaze stay on me.

40:36.573 --> 40:38.742
And it ain't like he lookin' at me.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.471
He lookin' through me.

40:46.076 --> 40:49.083
I ain't know what this was foretellin'.

40:49.119 --> 40:51.264
And I still ain't exactly sure.

40:52.916 --> 40:56.718
But I got some small understandin' of it

40:56.754 --> 40:58.954
after a unexpected meetin'

40:58.989 --> 41:01.063
earlier this year in St. Catherine's.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.991
A visitor come to my door.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.799
And you know what I saw
when I opened it?

41:06.630 --> 41:09.639
I saw an old man
with a long white beard.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.743
And a wishful look in his eye.

41:15.892 --> 41:18.927
Like me, he had been known
by many names.

41:20.824 --> 41:24.425
The most fittin' I could see
be "Captain Brown."

41:26.517 --> 41:29.858
No doubt that you've heard of him

41:29.893 --> 41:32.487
and his exploits
as a friend of the cause.

41:32.523 --> 41:33.989
He's no friend.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.259
- He's a murderer.
- The Captain is the future of this fight.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.477
Mr. Brown and his methods

41:37.513 --> 41:38.505
are too extreme.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.397
And his methods get results.

41:40.444 --> 41:42.082
His methods give all of us a bad name.

41:42.117 --> 41:43.500
Everyone, stop.

41:44.081 --> 41:45.180
We're here

41:45.215 --> 41:46.601
to hear Harriet speak.

41:47.184 --> 41:49.317
So let her speak.

41:56.378 --> 41:57.972
It took me some time

41:59.696 --> 42:02.252
to line up my thoughts on the Captain.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.633
Here was this white man,
standin' before a room

42:05.669 --> 42:07.535
of black folks
who had all been in bondage,

42:07.571 --> 42:10.515
tellin' us that he was ready
to take up the cause

42:11.508 --> 42:14.009
of a race that was not his own.

42:16.279 --> 42:18.493
He ain't know
the cripplin' grip of slavery.

42:19.416 --> 42:23.018
He ain't know the intractable
will of the slaveholders.

42:23.611 --> 42:25.887
And everything I knew told me
no white man would be willin'

42:25.922 --> 42:30.425
to risk his own blood
for black folks' freedom.

42:32.529 --> 42:34.629
But the Captain would,

42:35.379 --> 42:37.327
and he already had.

42:38.380 --> 42:41.336
His son bled with Kansas.

42:41.541 --> 42:44.037
Died in the Pottawatomie massacre.

42:45.375 --> 42:47.565
So every time I thought on it,

42:48.612 --> 42:51.880
everything that confused me about him

42:51.915 --> 42:54.382
built my admiration for him.

42:54.732 --> 42:59.276
I only know two other men
ready to sacrifice their sons:

43:00.090 --> 43:01.790
the prophet Abraham

43:02.069 --> 43:05.226
and the one who done
ordered that sacrifice.

43:09.297 --> 43:10.876
The Captain spoke

43:12.132 --> 43:14.380
of the conspiracy of the slave power.

43:15.105 --> 43:18.139
He shared my disdain for abolitionists

43:18.175 --> 43:20.909
who are unable to take
direct action against it.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.511
That thing I felt...
that dust that wouldn't settle...

43:23.547 --> 43:24.765
he had it, too.

43:25.424 --> 43:27.482
Except he had a name for it.

43:30.787 --> 43:32.077
War.

43:35.220 --> 43:36.591
When he spoke it,

43:36.626 --> 43:39.660
he spoke it quiet, like a... a prayer.

43:40.947 --> 43:42.516
And ain't that it?

43:44.340 --> 43:46.236
Ain't a prayer just a plea?

43:47.166 --> 43:48.736
A hope.

43:48.931 --> 43:50.772
A desire to believe
there's somethin' better

43:50.807 --> 43:52.440
on the other side of it.

43:52.476 --> 43:54.976
And don't we all want better?

43:58.996 --> 44:00.715
War.

44:03.420 --> 44:08.289
The more he said the word to me,
the more sense it made.

44:11.128 --> 44:15.124
Slavery ain't just a sin,
it's a state of war.

44:15.965 --> 44:19.634
Profitin' off the bodies of others.

44:19.669 --> 44:22.137
Rapin' the bodies of others.

44:22.172 --> 44:23.571
Killin' the bodies of others.

44:23.607 --> 44:25.273
Those are all acts of war.

44:25.308 --> 44:27.675
Been that way since the dawn of man.

44:27.711 --> 44:29.711
And we ain't been
callin' it that because

44:29.746 --> 44:32.814
there's a nationwide conspiracy
workin' against us...

44:32.849 --> 44:35.183
a conspiracy, as the Captain called it,

44:35.218 --> 44:37.852
of slaveholders actively at war,

44:37.888 --> 44:40.455
workin' hard to make it seem
the way of things.

44:40.490 --> 44:42.857
They pass it on
to their sons and daughters.

44:42.893 --> 44:44.959
They strengthen it through government.

44:44.995 --> 44:46.995
They justify it through religion,

44:47.030 --> 44:48.229
callin' it Christianity.

44:48.265 --> 44:50.131
That ain't my Christianity.

44:50.167 --> 44:51.533
Callin' it God's will.

44:51.568 --> 44:53.434
That ain't my God.

44:54.300 --> 44:55.837
Down South,

44:55.872 --> 44:58.306
they got men-stealers for ministers,

44:58.341 --> 45:02.010
women-whippers for missionaries,

45:02.045 --> 45:05.146
cradle-plunderers for church members.

45:05.182 --> 45:08.078
It's the most blasphemous of frauds.

45:09.155 --> 45:10.985
Mr. Douglass said that last part,

45:11.021 --> 45:13.471
and it's somethin' we all agree on.

45:14.724 --> 45:17.959
The Captain is steadfast
in his conviction.

45:17.994 --> 45:20.931
And I have no doubt
he's willin' to die for it.

45:21.965 --> 45:24.972
I don't intend to die for the cause.

45:26.303 --> 45:27.529
I will.

45:29.105 --> 45:31.564
To give up oneself... that be vital.

45:32.375 --> 45:35.577
It's the act of every saint and martyr.

45:35.612 --> 45:37.278
John the Baptist.

45:37.314 --> 45:38.781
Joan of Arc.

45:40.016 --> 45:42.183
But Minty of Dorchester

45:42.557 --> 45:45.420
just don't have the same
ring to it, does it?

45:48.225 --> 45:53.394
I want to live a long and full life.

45:53.430 --> 45:56.805
I'm tired of livin'
under the threat of death.

45:57.734 --> 46:00.702
Violence with no cause is brutality.

46:00.737 --> 46:03.366
That's the way of the slaveholder.

46:03.974 --> 46:06.808
But beatin' back against
those tryin' to kill you...

46:06.843 --> 46:08.543
that's hope.

46:08.578 --> 46:10.411
That's prayer.

46:10.447 --> 46:15.283
That's believin' you <i> will</i> live
a long and full life.

46:42.846 --> 46:44.004
War.

46:48.420 --> 46:49.669
Trust me,

46:51.253 --> 46:53.100
I don't want to go there either.

46:55.164 --> 46:57.225
But it's where we be.

47:04.208 --> 47:06.074
In the last year, by my estimation,

47:06.110 --> 47:09.602
I done helped over 50 souls
find their way North.

47:10.481 --> 47:12.759
I know I'm doin' the Lord's work.

47:13.384 --> 47:15.422
I know we is changin' lives.

47:16.653 --> 47:19.064
But I also know
the world ain't changin'.

47:20.090 --> 47:21.470
I believe it's got to.

47:22.526 --> 47:25.391
We all here 'cause
we believe it's got to.

47:26.663 --> 47:27.976
But we...

47:28.665 --> 47:32.067
all here... talkin' to each other.

47:32.102 --> 47:34.889
Right now we ain't out there
changin' it, are we?

47:35.572 --> 47:37.873
We here, in Philadelphia,

47:37.908 --> 47:40.609
this shinin' city
that I heard of from afar,

47:40.644 --> 47:43.112
that I thought might be heaven
when I arrived,

47:44.715 --> 47:47.205
where freedom rings like that bell.

47:47.951 --> 47:49.985
But how many white folks rioted

47:50.020 --> 47:52.988
when the fugitive slaves
moved too close?

47:53.408 --> 47:55.624
How many Yankees we pass
in the streets every day

47:55.659 --> 47:57.259
in their suit jackets and petticoats

47:57.294 --> 47:59.661
made of the cotton
that done bloodied the hands

47:59.696 --> 48:01.383
of half this country?

48:02.466 --> 48:05.696
We call ourselves abolitionists.

48:06.552 --> 48:08.632
But we ain't abolished nothin'.

48:10.082 --> 48:13.608
So much of our breath be spent
arguin' over methods

48:13.644 --> 48:15.945
that it overshadows the purpose.

48:17.097 --> 48:19.047
We speak of the cause with such fervor,

48:19.083 --> 48:21.249
yet we see no effect.

48:21.285 --> 48:23.885
A passionate debate
about action is important,

48:23.921 --> 48:27.422
but it should never be mistaken
for action itself.

48:27.797 --> 48:30.392
As we fight amongst ourselves
on how to defeat the enemy,

48:30.427 --> 48:33.328
the enemy takes more ground
in this war every day,

48:33.363 --> 48:36.164
from ballot boxes to breedin' farms,

48:36.200 --> 48:39.000
marchin' in lockstep against us,
while we bicker

48:39.036 --> 48:42.070
over what song our fife
and bugle should play.

48:42.106 --> 48:44.272
We make enemies of ourselves

48:44.308 --> 48:47.909
over of a deep fear of the real enemy,

48:47.945 --> 48:51.980
a fear borne of
the daunting odds of us winning.

48:52.219 --> 48:54.049
Yeah, winning this war is tough.

48:54.084 --> 48:57.052
Tough, but not impossible.

48:57.087 --> 48:59.754
I've witnessed firsthand the heroism

48:59.790 --> 49:01.857
and feats accomplished

49:01.892 --> 49:05.227
by our network of abolitionists
in name of the cause.

49:05.455 --> 49:08.029
Our numbers... our numbers have grown,

49:08.065 --> 49:11.166
as has the power of the Underground.

49:11.201 --> 49:12.767
But we got a ways to go

49:12.803 --> 49:15.615
to meet what is required in this fight.

49:16.815 --> 49:19.574
The work everybody in this room
been doin' is good.

49:19.610 --> 49:20.910
It's important.

49:22.412 --> 49:23.784
But it ain't enough.

49:24.753 --> 49:25.814
You may think it is.

49:25.849 --> 49:28.192
You <i> can</i> think it is, 'cause you free.

49:29.353 --> 49:31.017
Nothin' be expected of you.

49:31.855 --> 49:34.608
And nothin' is to be gained
for you and yours

49:35.226 --> 49:37.592
from the abolition
of this wretched institution.

49:37.628 --> 49:40.162
This line of thinkin', though
it lightens your burdens,

49:40.197 --> 49:41.763
it can be akin to apathy.

49:41.798 --> 49:44.132
I've felt it myself,
bein' free in the North.

49:44.168 --> 49:46.535
I can be guilty of similar thoughts.

49:46.570 --> 49:49.871
Them runs down South can be hard
on the body and the spirit,

49:49.907 --> 49:51.606
and I ain't gettin' no younger.

49:51.642 --> 49:54.042
Neither are my parents,
livin' with me now,

49:54.077 --> 49:56.411
needin' me to provide for them.

49:58.282 --> 50:00.215
All I done?

50:00.250 --> 50:01.936
I believe it be enough.

50:02.831 --> 50:05.360
I can believe it 'cause I'm free.

50:06.690 --> 50:08.864
But Captain John's visit

50:09.293 --> 50:12.661
reminded me of somethin' I learned

50:12.696 --> 50:15.351
when I was that
troublemakin' little girl.

50:16.633 --> 50:20.400
There ain't no negotiations on freedom.

50:20.804 --> 50:22.984
Big or small.

50:23.534 --> 50:25.734
There ain't no compromises

50:25.909 --> 50:28.009
or no half measures that mean anything,

50:28.045 --> 50:30.378
not to those in bondage.

50:30.414 --> 50:32.283
And not for any of us either.

50:32.950 --> 50:35.817
'Cause a country built on bodies

50:35.852 --> 50:38.535
will always need more for the slaughter.

50:39.189 --> 50:42.624
As long as slavery stands,
ain't none of us,

50:42.659 --> 50:47.028
no matter hue, man or woman, be free.

50:47.064 --> 50:50.332
And if you refuse to see
the chains that we all wearin',

50:50.367 --> 50:52.234
then you livin' in a dream,

50:52.269 --> 50:55.447
and the rest of us are sufferin'
in the real world 'cause of it.

50:57.488 --> 50:59.874
I'm sure you all came here

50:59.910 --> 51:02.847
to hear the horrifyin' stories
of brutality

51:03.280 --> 51:06.080
and the triumphant tales of courage.

51:07.082 --> 51:08.783
When Mr. Still asked me to speak,

51:08.819 --> 51:12.220
he told me all I needed to do
was tell my story.

51:14.091 --> 51:16.279
But my story ain't over.

51:17.494 --> 51:18.847
And it ain't my own.

51:20.864 --> 51:22.273
Our action,

51:23.267 --> 51:25.103
<i>and</i> our inactions,

51:26.249 --> 51:29.369
changes the course of things... all us.

51:30.874 --> 51:32.328
Me?

51:33.744 --> 51:36.151
I aim to continue to act.

51:38.781 --> 51:42.183
And it seem to me Captain Brown's path

51:42.208 --> 51:45.109
be the only way left for me to travel.

51:47.057 --> 51:49.624
I done talked a lot about
what my momma taught me,

51:49.660 --> 51:52.671
but my daddy taught me
a lot of lessons, too.

51:53.392 --> 51:55.563
He showed me every
which way to fell a tree,

51:55.599 --> 51:58.536
dependin' on its lineage or condition.

51:59.312 --> 52:02.370
He taught me there ain't no tree
that could best a axe

52:02.406 --> 52:06.908
in the right hands,
no matter how strong its trunk,

52:06.943 --> 52:09.678
no matter how long it's been there.

52:09.713 --> 52:12.823
And he taught me
about plantin' seeds, too.

52:13.917 --> 52:18.520
An acorn, hard as a rock when it fell,

52:18.555 --> 52:22.223
would be swallowed up
by the ground, cracked open,

52:22.259 --> 52:25.960
in what may seem like
a violent act of destruction.

52:25.996 --> 52:27.951
But that be growth, too.

52:29.700 --> 52:34.369
The acorn must come completely undone

52:34.656 --> 52:38.006
in order for new life to emerge.

52:39.795 --> 52:40.784
And I admit,

52:41.912 --> 52:44.479
as I stand here
at the start of a new path,

52:44.514 --> 52:45.897
lookin' forward...

52:46.917 --> 52:49.317
I'm feelin' somethin' like
what my brothers must have felt

52:49.353 --> 52:51.111
all them years ago.

52:52.356 --> 52:56.825
And I'm prayin' to him
for that wildfire in me

52:56.860 --> 52:59.015
to burn away all doubt.

53:00.323 --> 53:03.331
And if Captain Brown's prayer
ain't yours...

53:06.399 --> 53:07.769
...if you don't have it in you

53:07.804 --> 53:10.375
to take up arms against the injustice,

53:11.508 --> 53:14.143
then you got to pray another prayer.

53:15.304 --> 53:17.551
And you got to walk in it
with conviction.

53:18.815 --> 53:21.871
He will provide,
but you got to do your part.

53:22.919 --> 53:27.357
You got to find what it means
for you to be a soldier.

53:28.225 --> 53:30.925
Beat back those that are tryin' to kill

53:30.961 --> 53:32.761
everything good and right in the world,

53:32.796 --> 53:35.336
and call it makin' it great again.

53:35.999 --> 53:39.381
We can't afford to be just
citizens in a time of war.

53:39.903 --> 53:41.421
That'd be surrender.

53:42.205 --> 53:46.181
That'd be givin' up our future
and our souls.

53:47.136 --> 53:50.656
Ain't nobody get to
sit this one out, you hear me?
