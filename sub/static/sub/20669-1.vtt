03:04.013 --> 03:05.214
Oh my God.

03:05.248 --> 03:06.683
Do you think we could
avoid responsibility

03:06.716 --> 03:09.085
somewhere besides a junk yard sale?

03:09.118 --> 03:09.953
Yes.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.824
We could drop out, have
the pizza delivered to Samantha,

03:16.259 --> 03:19.228
and we could keep driving
until we find paradise.

03:19.262 --> 03:20.864
I don't need paradise, okay.

03:20.897 --> 03:21.698
I studied.

03:21.731 --> 03:22.632
Studying.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.234
You always take the easy way out.

03:25.268 --> 03:27.103
Hmm, I'm sorry if I passed on
the 15 hour cramming session

03:27.136 --> 03:29.873
followed by whatever pact with
the devil you plan to make

03:29.906 --> 03:31.107
to get a C or D.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.343
Okay, mister,
Cs and Ds will grant this girl...

03:34.377 --> 03:35.879
- ...a degree.
- Uh-huh.

03:36.746 --> 03:38.682
So, what's it going to be?

03:39.749 --> 03:41.785
Paradise or yard sale?

03:42.852 --> 03:43.687
Or both.

03:44.453 --> 03:45.789
Please say both.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.291
Let's just get this over with, okay?

03:48.324 --> 03:49.659
Wonderful, shitty hand-me-downs.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.160
Wow, this is great, Jess.

03:51.194 --> 03:53.362
You really outdid yourself.

03:53.396 --> 03:54.831
Where you see shitty hand-me-downs,

03:54.864 --> 03:56.966
I see unwanted treasures.

03:58.034 --> 03:59.669
Besides, Sam's birthday's coming up.

03:59.703 --> 04:02.105
And you look for a gift at a yard sale?

04:02.138 --> 04:03.206
Classy broad.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.910
Poor college student, remember.

04:07.944 --> 04:10.213
What do you think of this.

04:10.246 --> 04:11.080
No.

04:12.448 --> 04:13.783
I don't know.

04:13.817 --> 04:15.018
Rancho photography's kind of cool.

04:19.755 --> 04:20.957
I gotta take this, this is work.

04:20.990 --> 04:21.825
Hey, please don't
take forever, all right.

04:21.858 --> 04:23.092
We gotta study.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.229
You must study 'til you die.

04:35.471 --> 04:38.074
Make you a good deal on that.

04:39.242 --> 04:40.309
Brought it on a couple
of family vacations.

04:40.343 --> 04:41.778
It always took nice pictures.

04:41.811 --> 04:43.947
Uh, thanks,

04:43.980 --> 04:46.716
but I don't think snapping Polaroids

04:46.750 --> 04:48.785
is really my friend's thing, so.

04:48.818 --> 04:50.720
Oh, so you're looking for a gift, huh?

04:50.754 --> 04:51.755
Mm-hmm.

04:51.788 --> 04:52.621
Hmm.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.259
I think I might have something for you.

04:57.426 --> 04:58.527
I've been going back and forth

04:58.561 --> 05:03.132
on whether or not I wanted
the part with this.

05:04.133 --> 05:05.835
This is perfect.

05:09.806 --> 05:13.977
My wife, she always thought
the world of that little box.

05:14.443 --> 05:15.211
I bet.

05:15.244 --> 05:17.246
So?

05:17.280 --> 05:20.116
How much?

05:21.017 --> 05:22.786
Um, I don't know.

05:23.552 --> 05:25.789
Five bucks sound fair?

05:26.055 --> 05:26.756
Very.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.032
Look, I'm sure it's found a good home.

05:36.065 --> 05:37.867
Mm-hmm.

05:39.836 --> 05:42.438
Let me know if you need
a price on anything else here.

05:42.471 --> 05:43.739
Absolutely.

05:44.140 --> 05:44.507
Thank you.

05:46.109 --> 05:47.443
Should be fun.

05:49.345 --> 05:50.146
Okay, yeah.

05:50.179 --> 05:51.280
Yeah, thanks.

05:52.081 --> 05:53.416
And you chose that?

05:53.449 --> 05:55.451
Uh yeah, it's amazing.

05:56.585 --> 05:58.287
Congratulations, you bought something.

05:58.321 --> 05:59.222
So can we go now?

05:59.255 --> 06:00.556
Some of us have papers to write.

06:00.589 --> 06:04.760
I think I have a paper to write.

06:06.295 --> 06:07.130
Yep.

06:08.097 --> 06:09.799
I was talking about you.

06:29.853 --> 06:31.921
I think I'm done.

06:31.955 --> 06:32.788
Done?

06:33.322 --> 06:34.157
With what?

06:34.958 --> 06:35.758
Accounting.

06:35.791 --> 06:38.427
School, life, et cetera, et cetera.

06:38.461 --> 06:41.497
Simple solution, change your major.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.900
I'm scared to do something
impractical with my life.

06:43.933 --> 06:47.603
Or scared to do something
your dad might not pay for.

06:47.636 --> 06:49.572
I'll get you through it.

06:49.605 --> 06:50.840
I promise.

06:52.976 --> 06:53.943
Oh, hold on.

06:57.013 --> 06:58.948
And don't let her see it.

06:58.982 --> 07:00.116
Wouldn't dare.

07:05.955 --> 07:07.190
It's about time.

07:07.223 --> 07:08.591
I thought you guys left me for dead.

07:08.624 --> 07:09.959
Blame your BFF.

07:09.993 --> 07:10.927
And I do.

07:11.928 --> 07:13.329
Just leave the pizza
on the table, traitor.

07:13.362 --> 07:15.831
And my work here is done.

07:16.499 --> 07:19.068
Let me guess, paradise again?

07:20.569 --> 07:22.405
You know, you really
do this to yourself.

07:22.438 --> 07:24.373
All you have to do is study.

07:25.641 --> 07:27.911
I don't know what it
is about intermediate

07:27.944 --> 07:29.913
that makes me so hungry.

07:29.946 --> 07:32.515
So, you finished the chapter?

07:33.249 --> 07:34.417
Answered the questions?

07:34.450 --> 07:35.952
Of course I did.

07:36.685 --> 07:37.453
A couple minutes ago.

07:37.486 --> 07:38.922
Mind if I take a peak?

07:38.955 --> 07:39.989
Or two?

08:36.145 --> 08:37.645
What do you think?

08:38.381 --> 08:39.448
Personally?

08:41.083 --> 08:42.717
I think the paper might be worth
more than the box.

08:42.751 --> 08:44.653
Shoulda got a gift card or something.

08:44.687 --> 08:47.023
Oh, or some crappy camera?

08:48.424 --> 08:50.693
You are aware that phones
have cameras now, aren't you?

08:50.726 --> 08:53.062
You do know that phones
don't magically develop photos

08:53.096 --> 08:54.397
before my eyes, right?

08:58.367 --> 09:01.070
You know, break's coming up.

09:02.038 --> 09:04.107
What do you say we hit the coast?

09:05.108 --> 09:06.709
A little sun might look good on you.

09:06.742 --> 09:08.711
I can think of something else
that might look good on me.

09:08.744 --> 09:12.081
We don't have to go anywhere for that.

09:12.115 --> 09:14.050
Is this your way of
getting what you want?

09:14.083 --> 09:15.118
Depends.

09:15.551 --> 09:16.719
Is it working?

09:17.553 --> 09:18.454
Doesn't it always?

10:01.564 --> 10:04.233
Come on.

10:15.378 --> 10:17.046
Oh yeah.

11:28.784 --> 11:30.119
Uh-huh, right.

11:33.189 --> 11:35.291
And you got the cake mix?

11:36.459 --> 11:38.827
All right, love, see you soon.

11:38.861 --> 11:39.695
Bye.

12:52.635 --> 12:55.170
Hey, wanna give me a hand?

13:01.344 --> 13:03.479
It was awful.

13:05.348 --> 13:06.749
Made with love.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.484
And sugar.

13:09.017 --> 13:10.553
Mostly sugar, I hope.

13:10.586 --> 13:11.754
Make a wish.

13:16.024 --> 13:17.960
All right, all right,
ya'll take a slice.

13:17.993 --> 13:20.529
I'm already five pounds
into my freshman 15,

13:20.563 --> 13:22.231
so help a girl out.

13:22.265 --> 13:24.667
So, um, did you guys
get me anything else?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.269
Mm-hmm.

13:27.336 --> 13:28.637
And happy birthday.

13:29.572 --> 13:31.407
Thank you, you guys.

13:32.341 --> 13:32.908
It's a pony.

13:34.042 --> 13:36.379
Open it.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.515
All right.

13:42.318 --> 13:42.951
You guys.

13:42.985 --> 13:44.353
You like it?

13:44.753 --> 13:45.388
I love it.

13:45.854 --> 13:46.689
See?

13:47.423 --> 13:48.757
Yes, I do have eyes.

13:48.791 --> 13:50.025
It reminds me of something
my mom would have

13:50.058 --> 13:51.660
in her living room.

13:52.595 --> 13:54.697
All right, so, cake, check.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.265
Presents, check.

13:57.032 --> 13:58.000
What do you all say
we get the hell out of here

13:58.033 --> 13:59.067
and go a little crazy.

14:00.869 --> 14:04.273
Or how about the giant bug
marathon on TV tonight?

14:07.376 --> 14:08.411
No.

14:08.944 --> 14:10.346
All right, fine.

14:11.079 --> 14:13.248
Let's go to the club.

14:50.386 --> 14:51.019
Hey mom.

14:51.920 --> 14:52.755
It's me.

14:53.722 --> 14:56.592
I'm sorry I missed you earlier,
I was in class.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.794
Anyway, the box I sent you,

14:59.962 --> 15:01.063
Jess gave that to me for my birthday.

15:01.096 --> 15:03.932
And anyway, it made me think of home.

15:03.966 --> 15:07.570
But I love you, and
I'll talk to you later.

15:08.837 --> 15:09.672
Bye.

15:17.112 --> 15:18.681
No.

15:18.714 --> 15:19.882
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.918
Yes.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.354
Cheers.

15:35.764 --> 15:38.401
The next one will taste better.

15:38.434 --> 15:39.668
That's disgusting.

16:36.925 --> 16:40.829
Jessica, did you remember
to pay the cable bill?

16:40.863 --> 16:41.697
Yes.

16:42.865 --> 16:45.601
Did you check to make sure
everything is plugged in right?

16:45.634 --> 16:47.803
Everything's plugged in.

16:49.004 --> 16:49.772
Fine, I'll double check from my phone

16:49.805 --> 16:51.173
when we're on the road.

16:51.206 --> 16:52.575
You know, I might call that guy

16:52.608 --> 16:54.543
that I met the other night at the bar.

16:54.577 --> 16:58.481
Tall, dark, and all over you.

16:59.448 --> 17:01.450
I am so glad you are
finally gettin' in touch

17:01.484 --> 17:03.486
with your inner goddess.

17:04.219 --> 17:06.888
All right, well, call me if you need me.

17:06.922 --> 17:08.457
Okay, will do.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.458
Yeah.

17:09.724 --> 17:10.459
Hey.

17:11.393 --> 17:13.228
You know, all this stuff
you're avoiding,

17:13.261 --> 17:15.698
it's gonna catch up with you.

17:15.731 --> 17:18.233
That's future Jess's problem.

17:18.266 --> 17:21.136
You try and have some fun, okay?

17:21.936 --> 17:22.771
Okay.

17:43.659 --> 17:46.261
* I'm gonna make this grilled cheese *

17:46.294 --> 17:50.465
* I'm gonna make
this grilled cheese, please *

17:58.273 --> 17:59.642
Damn it, Jess.

18:10.018 --> 18:10.853
Hello?

18:13.255 --> 18:14.089
Oh.

18:14.557 --> 18:15.558
Oh, hey.

18:19.061 --> 18:21.496
Yeah, a movie sounds great.

18:22.898 --> 18:24.499
I'll see you later.

18:25.634 --> 18:26.268
Okay, bye.

19:33.068 --> 19:33.902
Jess?

19:35.871 --> 19:36.705
Cole?

19:41.677 --> 19:43.211
Did you forget something?

19:50.318 --> 19:51.754
I have a knife.

19:53.756 --> 19:54.890
I will stab you.

21:06.962 --> 21:10.665
Guys?

21:17.505 --> 21:19.775
All good girls want to die.

21:26.982 --> 21:31.053
Damn it, Jess.

22:10.092 --> 22:11.193
That's not...

22:16.064 --> 22:17.966
I'm calling the police!

22:20.402 --> 22:22.504
All good girls want to die.

22:29.544 --> 22:31.847
All good girls want to die.

22:33.882 --> 22:35.951
All good girls want to die.

22:45.560 --> 22:49.932
All good girls want to die.

23:33.942 --> 23:35.844
Hey, Sam, I'm at the door.

23:35.878 --> 23:37.212
What's the deal?

23:45.587 --> 23:46.421
Fine.

23:47.022 --> 23:47.422
Whatever.

24:13.248 --> 24:16.018
Samantha, we're home.

24:17.252 --> 24:19.654
Well, the place is still standing.

24:19.687 --> 24:21.023
That's a plus, right?

24:21.056 --> 24:22.891
Yeah, I'm sure she has her reasons

24:22.925 --> 24:26.895
for not calling or texting me
back for several days.

24:28.196 --> 24:29.397
No use hiding.

24:31.466 --> 24:32.600
I know you're here.

24:35.437 --> 24:37.205
You're back already?

24:37.239 --> 24:38.140
Already?

24:38.173 --> 24:40.408
It's been almost four days.

24:41.977 --> 24:43.478
Are you all right?

24:44.346 --> 24:46.114
You don't look all right.

24:56.558 --> 24:57.359
Sam.

24:58.026 --> 24:58.626
Breathe.

25:02.697 --> 25:04.699
I don't think I've drank
anything for days.

25:04.732 --> 25:05.968
Days?

25:06.501 --> 25:07.502
You've been sick?

25:07.535 --> 25:08.636
Yeah, sick.

25:09.972 --> 25:10.973
Stomach bug.

25:11.639 --> 25:14.242
Honey, that sucks.

25:14.276 --> 25:15.477
Yeah, nasty.

25:16.644 --> 25:17.980
So you didn't even
hook up with that guy?

25:18.013 --> 25:18.646
No.

25:19.381 --> 25:20.248
No, lucky for him.

25:20.983 --> 25:22.985
I'm gonna take a shower.

25:23.718 --> 25:26.488
I'm happy to have you all back.

26:01.089 --> 26:04.092
All good girls want to die.

26:04.759 --> 26:07.062
All good girls want to die.

26:56.711 --> 26:58.546
Whatcha doing?

26:58.580 --> 27:01.083
Oh, um, just some online MD.

27:02.717 --> 27:04.086
Well, night.

27:04.619 --> 27:06.054
I hope you feel better.

27:06.088 --> 27:07.389
Yeah, goodnight.

27:24.772 --> 27:26.641
What's wrong?

27:26.674 --> 27:29.144
I don't think she's left
that couch in three days.

27:29.177 --> 27:30.212
Drugs?

27:31.146 --> 27:33.081
She can barely handle an espresso.

27:33.115 --> 27:34.716
She said she's still sick.

27:34.749 --> 27:36.418
Maybe she is sick.

27:37.785 --> 27:39.154
A hypochondriac like her
would be at the doctor's office,

27:39.187 --> 27:40.088
not online.

27:41.055 --> 27:43.091
I just wish I could get
a peak at her laptop.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.393
Look at you goin' all NSA.

27:45.427 --> 27:48.830
Look, for all we know
it's online dating.

27:49.431 --> 27:50.165
I'm serious.

27:50.765 --> 27:51.933
Yeah, so am I.

27:51.966 --> 27:54.569
Look, if you're really concerned,
just call her parents.

27:54.602 --> 27:57.071
Oh, now who's goin' all NSA?

27:59.174 --> 28:01.443
I just wish I knew what she was up to.

28:01.476 --> 28:03.111
bases down.

28:03.145 --> 28:04.479
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

28:04.512 --> 28:05.313
Shit.

28:07.215 --> 28:08.616
What?

28:08.650 --> 28:12.487
Right center field, reaching...

28:34.276 --> 28:35.177
What are you doing?

28:35.210 --> 28:38.413
Oh, um, movie tickets.

28:38.446 --> 28:41.549
You have your own computer for that.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.885
So, you wanna come out with us tonight?

28:43.918 --> 28:46.354
No, I've got stuff to do.

28:47.222 --> 28:48.190
Yeah, stuff.

28:49.624 --> 28:51.159
So, what is that you were looking
at on your computer?

28:51.193 --> 28:52.360
It looked kind of creepy.

28:52.394 --> 28:53.528
It's for a class.

28:53.561 --> 28:54.629
What class?

28:55.363 --> 28:56.598
You know what, Jess,

28:56.631 --> 28:57.632
you need to get off my back, all right.

28:57.665 --> 28:59.434
It's none of your business.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.403
What is going on with you lately?

29:01.436 --> 29:02.570
First you're really sick,

29:02.604 --> 29:03.738
and now you're acting really strange.

29:03.771 --> 29:05.573
I mean, I can't figure you out anymore.

29:05.607 --> 29:08.710
And have you smelled yourself lately?

29:09.311 --> 29:09.611
You reek.

29:10.178 --> 29:11.513
Even the couch stinks.

29:12.314 --> 29:12.747
What's wrong?

29:13.348 --> 29:14.182
Talk to me.

29:14.882 --> 29:16.184
Take a hint.

29:16.218 --> 29:18.152
I don't need your help.

29:19.321 --> 29:20.388
God, you got me into this crap anyway.

29:20.422 --> 29:22.757
The last thing I need for
you to do is make it worse.

29:22.790 --> 29:24.292
Got you into this?

29:24.326 --> 29:26.394
What are you talking about?

29:28.396 --> 29:29.897
Look, I'm sorry.

29:31.699 --> 29:33.201
It'll be over by tomorrow.

29:33.235 --> 29:34.736
And if it isn't?

29:35.337 --> 29:35.770
It will.

29:36.771 --> 29:40.675
And you're gonna tell me
what's been going on?

29:41.843 --> 29:44.346
Okay, I'm gonna hold you to that.

29:47.549 --> 29:50.218
I know what you want me to do.

29:51.886 --> 29:53.788
I wanna do it desperately.

30:00.895 --> 30:02.330
I hope you choke on it.

30:06.768 --> 30:09.271
You can't have my friends too.

30:12.540 --> 30:13.875
You greedy fuck.

32:09.123 --> 32:12.026
You're supposed to be at
the bottom of the fucking lake.

32:36.884 --> 32:39.887
All good girls want to die.

32:50.131 --> 32:50.932
No.

33:16.223 --> 33:18.626
Can somebody help me, please?

33:25.567 --> 33:28.536
All good girls want to die.

33:29.203 --> 33:31.105
All good girls want to die.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.709
All good girls want to die.

33:34.742 --> 33:37.011
All good girls want to die.

33:37.879 --> 33:39.213
All good girls want to die.

33:43.718 --> 33:45.553
All good girls want to die.

33:45.587 --> 33:47.755
All good girls want to die

33:48.656 --> 33:51.459
* All good girls want to die

33:51.493 --> 33:54.896
* All good girls want to die

33:54.929 --> 33:57.665
* All good girls want to die

33:57.699 --> 34:00.468
* All good girls want to die

34:00.502 --> 34:04.672
* All good girls want to die *

34:54.922 --> 34:56.623
You okay?

34:58.993 --> 35:00.928
Did we not see something?

35:00.962 --> 35:03.230
Did I just let this happen?

35:03.965 --> 35:05.867
She was my best friend.

35:09.270 --> 35:10.104
Hey.

35:11.172 --> 35:13.007
This isn't your fault.

35:13.741 --> 35:15.176
She said it was.

35:16.343 --> 35:16.978
I should have just called her parents.

35:17.011 --> 35:18.245
No, no, no.

35:18.279 --> 35:19.714
Look, look, it wouldn't
have done a thing, okay.

35:19.747 --> 35:22.016
Whatever was wrong with
her, she hid from us.

35:22.049 --> 35:25.219
And she probably hid it from them too.

35:27.655 --> 35:29.691
I thought they took all of her stuff.

35:29.724 --> 35:31.826
I guess they forgot it.

35:32.694 --> 35:34.696
It's ours again, I suppose.

35:59.787 --> 36:01.188
What you doing?

36:02.924 --> 36:05.893
I wish I could cut the damn thing down.

36:05.927 --> 36:10.097
Hey, look, let's
go watch something funny.

36:10.965 --> 36:12.634
I don't feel like laughing.

36:12.667 --> 36:15.369
Well, then let's watch
someone else laugh.

36:25.713 --> 36:27.915
Barking out of the dugout on that call.

36:27.949 --> 36:29.183
He wanted...

36:29.216 --> 36:32.386
I think I'm going to bed.

36:32.419 --> 36:33.320
You okay?

36:35.122 --> 36:38.359
I just need to shut off
for a little while.

36:38.392 --> 36:39.593
All right.

37:20.935 --> 37:21.769
Cole?

37:31.813 --> 37:34.716
All good boys want to die.

37:46.493 --> 37:48.930
All good girls want to die.

38:00.742 --> 38:02.977
All good girls want to die.

39:09.310 --> 39:10.144
Cole?

39:10.544 --> 39:11.846
Oh God, Cole.

39:12.446 --> 39:14.816
Cole.

39:14.849 --> 39:16.417
Cole, Cole, please.

39:17.852 --> 39:18.285
Please, look at me, Cole.

39:18.319 --> 39:18.986
Thank God.

39:20.254 --> 39:21.088
You too?

39:23.324 --> 39:24.926
What the hell is that thing?

39:24.959 --> 39:28.762
I don't know, but it
came out of the box.

39:29.296 --> 39:30.531
Samantha's music box?

39:30.564 --> 39:31.866
Yeah, look, I know how it sounds,
but I saw it.

39:31.899 --> 39:33.200
Fuck, I was attacked by something

39:33.234 --> 39:34.836
that I don't even believe in.

39:34.869 --> 39:38.806
Okay, it was like a
fucking demon or something.

39:39.573 --> 39:41.843
What, you think this
happened to Samantha?

39:41.876 --> 39:42.910
Look, whatever it is,

39:42.944 --> 39:46.180
we have to destroy it
before we end up like her.

39:46.213 --> 39:48.049
So we're in agreement?

39:49.216 --> 39:50.551
Whatever that thing was, it killed Sam.

39:54.021 --> 39:57.124
Yeah, it almost did the same to us.

39:59.894 --> 40:01.295
I'm sorry, Sam.

40:04.899 --> 40:06.400
Good riddance.

40:13.574 --> 40:15.910
All good boys want to die.

40:15.943 --> 40:18.112
All good boys want to die.

40:18.980 --> 40:19.881
All good boys want to die.

40:19.914 --> 40:21.348
All good boys want to die.

40:21.382 --> 40:22.416
All good boys want to die.

40:22.449 --> 40:23.885
Cole?

40:23.918 --> 40:25.386
All good boys want to die.

40:25.419 --> 40:26.854
All good boys want to die.

40:26.888 --> 40:27.989
What the fuck, I'm on fire.

40:28.022 --> 40:28.956
What?

40:28.990 --> 40:29.590
What's wrong?

40:29.623 --> 40:30.624
Show me.

40:30.657 --> 40:31.926
My stomach!

40:32.593 --> 40:33.627
It feels like it's on fire.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.996
Get it out.

40:35.262 --> 40:36.497
What?

40:36.530 --> 40:37.932
Get the fucking box out of the fire.

40:37.965 --> 40:39.400
Ow fuck.

40:53.547 --> 40:54.982
Are you okay?

40:57.118 --> 40:57.919
I guess.

40:58.519 --> 40:59.386
I don't know.

41:00.487 --> 41:02.489
It doesn't hurt anymore.

41:07.094 --> 41:08.395
Yeah, no, I understand.

41:08.429 --> 41:09.997
I completely understand.

41:10.031 --> 41:12.599
Yeah, I hope the new guy
works out for you.

41:12.633 --> 41:15.102
Yeah, Jess and I are both still sick.

41:15.136 --> 41:16.938
Nasty little thing.

41:17.538 --> 41:18.439
Yeah.

41:18.472 --> 41:20.007
Yeah, yeah, well, thanks.

41:20.041 --> 41:22.076
All right, have a good one.

41:32.686 --> 41:36.890
Well, I was just fired.

41:37.558 --> 41:39.226
We knew that was coming.

41:40.394 --> 41:41.963
But I think I found someone
who can help.

41:41.996 --> 41:42.863
Just don't tell me

41:42.896 --> 41:45.666
it's one of those fuckin' ghost hunters.

41:45.699 --> 41:46.934
A Dr. Harris.

41:48.169 --> 41:51.505
She teaches, actually,
at the university.

41:51.538 --> 41:53.074
She looks legit.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.276
And she's close.

41:57.211 --> 41:59.113
It's either this or a priest.

41:59.146 --> 42:02.950
For god's sake, fine.

42:02.984 --> 42:04.118
Go with the PhD.

42:09.690 --> 42:12.326
Thank you for coming
so quickly, Dr. Harris.

42:12.359 --> 42:13.995
Quite welcome.

42:14.028 --> 42:16.297
Your query at the very
least peaked our interest.

42:16.330 --> 42:17.698
Yeah, honestly,

42:17.731 --> 42:18.565
I'm not really comfortable
with any of this.

42:18.599 --> 42:20.601
I mean, do we really need the cameras?

42:20.634 --> 42:21.502
Yes.

42:21.535 --> 42:24.338
I don't like to miss important details.

42:24.371 --> 42:26.040
And if this is what you claim it to be,

42:26.073 --> 42:28.575
then you don't want me to either.

42:28.609 --> 42:29.443
If?

42:31.345 --> 42:32.746
You don't believe us?

42:32.779 --> 42:33.647
We are open to the fact

42:33.680 --> 42:36.283
that you two might be telling the truth.

42:36.317 --> 42:37.985
However, we're equally open

42:38.019 --> 42:40.721
to the fact that you might
be delusional, poisoned,

42:40.754 --> 42:42.756
brain damaged, ill, impaired, psychotic,

42:42.789 --> 42:44.491
chemically imbalanced, drug induced,

42:44.525 --> 42:45.626
and there's my least favorite,

42:45.659 --> 42:48.762
and unfortunately the more
common, just full of shit.

42:48.795 --> 42:50.764
Full of shit?

42:50.797 --> 42:51.732
What, are you fuckin' serious?

42:51.765 --> 42:53.167
Does this look full of shit?

42:53.200 --> 42:54.301
Huh, does this look
fuckin' full of shit?

42:54.335 --> 42:55.402
And she has twice as many.

42:55.436 --> 42:56.270
Cole.

42:57.604 --> 42:59.973
That is quite the sight.

43:01.142 --> 43:02.043
But experience has taught
me to be skeptical.

43:02.076 --> 43:03.544
And in a haunting,

43:03.577 --> 43:06.147
I prefer to place the burden
of proof with the victims.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.748
Besides, a lot of people
just want attention.

43:07.781 --> 43:09.416
Hey, we don't want your
fuckin' attention, all right.

43:09.450 --> 43:10.351
Do you see this place?

43:10.384 --> 43:11.752
Our lives were just wrecked.

43:11.785 --> 43:13.287
And there are the daydreams.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.488
Daydreams?

43:14.521 --> 43:16.690
Yeah, we fantasize
about killing ourselves.

43:16.723 --> 43:19.093
Which is why I think
that it killed Samantha.

43:19.126 --> 43:22.263
And you have my condolences, sincerely.

43:22.296 --> 43:24.131
Where have you seen the entity?

43:24.165 --> 43:25.266
Everywhere.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.335
So, the haunting is not
bound in one particular area.

43:28.369 --> 43:29.370
Interesting.

43:30.237 --> 43:32.339
When do you believe so started?

43:32.373 --> 43:36.110
I think it started when I got
the music box for Samantha.

43:36.143 --> 43:37.778
And how long ago was that?

43:37.811 --> 43:39.513
A few weeks now.

43:41.148 --> 43:42.516
Of course, we didn't
start seeing it until after.

43:42.549 --> 43:44.785
You know, after she killed herself.

43:44.818 --> 43:48.122
But I think this thing was
haunting her from the get-go.

43:48.155 --> 43:51.325
So the timeline is just a few weeks.

43:52.726 --> 43:55.062
That's an incredibly short
period of time for a haunting.

43:55.096 --> 43:56.497
So, where is it now?

43:58.265 --> 44:01.102
It's usually in Samantha's room.

44:02.103 --> 44:02.736
Usually.

44:07.108 --> 44:08.275
May I examine it?

44:10.144 --> 44:13.414
I'm surprised something so
holy-looking could be so evil.

44:13.447 --> 44:17.484
I'm afraid I suspect
that is precisely the idea.

44:17.518 --> 44:19.686
Ted, zoom in here, please.

44:23.724 --> 44:25.092
Very sneaky.

44:25.659 --> 44:26.727
You see that?

44:27.461 --> 44:28.595
It's upside down.

44:29.330 --> 44:30.297
This is sacrilege.

44:31.232 --> 44:31.765
An insult to God.

44:33.167 --> 44:35.169
What you have here is a devil's box.

44:35.202 --> 44:36.837
Wait, a devil's box?

44:37.571 --> 44:38.739
Sacrilege?

44:38.772 --> 44:40.107
Wait, are you saying all of this shit

44:40.141 --> 44:42.543
is because of a misprint on the cross?

44:42.576 --> 44:46.180
Something like this
wouldn't be an accident.

44:46.213 --> 44:47.681
Some people pervert holy images

44:47.714 --> 44:51.084
in an attempt to attract evil spirits.

44:51.752 --> 44:53.287
And sometimes something worse.

44:53.320 --> 44:56.223
This thing is definitely
something worse.

44:58.625 --> 44:59.626
Good news.

45:01.328 --> 45:04.265
You definitely have my attention.

45:04.865 --> 45:06.400
So, what do you think?

45:06.433 --> 45:07.901
Full of shit, delusional?

45:07.934 --> 45:10.537
I'm very delighted neither.

45:11.705 --> 45:12.606
I think they'll be a nice addition

45:12.639 --> 45:14.675
to my chapter on haunted items.

45:16.443 --> 45:17.911
So, how do you want it covered?

45:17.944 --> 45:18.912
Standard setup?

45:18.945 --> 45:20.113
That's fine.

45:21.515 --> 45:23.184
But I want you to put
a few cameras around the box.

45:23.217 --> 45:24.518
Get different readings.

45:24.551 --> 45:26.187
Perhaps we'll get lucky.

45:26.220 --> 45:27.688
Yeah, great idea.

45:27.721 --> 45:31.158
Have them sign releases, and
get photos of the bruises.

45:31.192 --> 45:32.226
On it.

45:32.259 --> 45:32.893
Ted.

45:34.961 --> 45:39.132
Call me optimistic, but I think
this one will be memorable.

45:40.534 --> 45:41.735
While you guys do that,

45:41.768 --> 45:43.170
I'm gonna go set up in your rooms.

45:43.204 --> 45:44.238
Okay.

45:45.239 --> 45:46.407
Just let me know if you
need me to move anything

45:46.440 --> 45:47.441
or whatever.

46:07.994 --> 46:10.864
So, this is the tree, correct?

46:11.998 --> 46:13.934
Have you seen anything
unusual here after her death?

46:13.967 --> 46:17.304
We don't go near it.

46:17.338 --> 46:19.273
Do you see anything of interest, Ted?

46:19.306 --> 46:20.607
Nothin' unusual.

46:21.808 --> 46:23.610
I'm surprised you guys stayed here.

46:23.644 --> 46:25.479
Couldn't break the lease.

46:25.512 --> 46:26.480
Not that it would have mattered.

46:26.513 --> 46:28.315
We tried staying at a few motels.

46:28.349 --> 46:30.851
And no matter where we went,
the box showed up.

46:30.884 --> 46:32.519
We even tried burning it.

46:32.553 --> 46:33.720
Interesting.

46:34.855 --> 46:37.324
Yeah, I'd rather not be near this tree.

46:38.259 --> 46:39.426
That's fine, dear.

46:39.460 --> 46:41.362
If you don't mind, we're gonna
examine a few more things.

46:41.395 --> 46:41.995
Yeah, sure.

46:42.028 --> 46:43.264
Go nuts.

46:44.931 --> 46:47.234
A suicide can attract
an extraordinary amount

46:47.268 --> 46:48.869
of negative energy.

46:50.304 --> 46:53.274
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

46:57.043 --> 46:59.813
Feels like you're setting up
a cheap TV show.

46:59.846 --> 47:01.315
Maybe we are.

47:03.317 --> 47:05.586
Seriously, it gets results.

47:09.423 --> 47:12.259
So, is this the worst case
you've ever seen?

47:14.060 --> 47:15.662
Too early to say.

47:16.530 --> 47:17.431
But try not to worry about it.

47:17.464 --> 47:19.366
You're in very capable hands.

47:29.075 --> 47:30.477
You mind gettin' the box for me?

47:30.511 --> 47:33.280
What, you don't wanna touch it?

47:34.014 --> 47:35.849
Yeah, I don't blame you.

47:42.356 --> 47:45.592
You can set it in the center, please.

47:47.894 --> 47:50.897
So, what do these do?

47:50.931 --> 47:54.335
Well, each is hopefully gonna
tell me something different.

47:54.368 --> 47:57.003
Infrared, flashing stills,
and high speed.

47:57.037 --> 47:59.340
Seems like a lot of the same thing.

47:59.373 --> 48:00.273
Oh, not quite.

48:00.307 --> 48:01.875
These things sometimes
present themselves

48:01.908 --> 48:03.076
in very subtle ways.

48:03.109 --> 48:06.713
So if it does present itself,
we wanna make sure we see it.

48:06.747 --> 48:07.848
Subtle?

48:07.881 --> 48:11.752
You won't have a hard time
seein' this fuckin' thing.

48:16.690 --> 48:17.691
You ready?

48:18.692 --> 48:19.860
Ready.

48:20.927 --> 48:23.530
Our Father who art in heaven,

48:24.665 --> 48:27.468
hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come.

48:30.404 --> 48:31.872
What is she doing?

48:32.473 --> 48:33.907
Cleansing.

48:33.940 --> 48:35.509
She's trying to get a
reaction from the spirit.

48:35.542 --> 48:38.845
Thought you needed
to be a priest to do that.

48:38.879 --> 48:42.649
Do you need to be a
mechanic to fix your car?

48:42.683 --> 48:46.853
You just need the proper
understanding of the tools.

49:15.649 --> 49:18.151
All good girls want to die.

49:19.119 --> 49:21.388
All good girls want to die.

49:21.422 --> 49:22.856
All good girls want to die.

49:22.889 --> 49:24.625
All good girls want to die.

49:25.926 --> 49:27.594
All good girls want to die.

49:27.628 --> 49:29.596
All good girls want to die.

49:29.630 --> 49:31.432
All good girls want to die.

49:31.465 --> 49:33.500
All good girls want to die.

49:33.534 --> 49:35.402
All good girls want to die.

49:35.436 --> 49:37.438
All good girls want to die.

49:37.471 --> 49:38.905
All good girls want to die.

49:38.939 --> 49:40.741
All good girls want to die.

49:40.774 --> 49:43.009
All good girls want to die.

49:45.746 --> 49:48.014
All good girls want to die.

49:49.182 --> 49:51.618
All good girls want to die.

49:53.019 --> 49:55.689
All good girls want to die.

49:55.722 --> 49:57.958
All good girls want to die.

49:58.825 --> 50:00.927
All good girls want to die.

50:02.529 --> 50:03.430
All good girls want to die.

50:03.464 --> 50:06.800
All good girls want to die.

50:07.668 --> 50:09.035
All good girls want to die.

50:09.069 --> 50:10.203
You okay?

50:16.943 --> 50:20.514
I just fantasized
about cutting my wrist.

50:21.582 --> 50:23.016
Let's just go to bed, okay.

50:23.049 --> 50:24.485
Maybe those two clowns

50:24.518 --> 50:26.753
will have this thing
wrapped by tomorrow.

50:26.787 --> 50:27.621
I know.

50:54.014 --> 50:55.516
Anything happen?

50:56.617 --> 50:57.551
Did you hear me scream?

50:58.785 --> 50:59.886
Good point.

51:02.022 --> 51:04.190
So, you have a good nap?

51:04.925 --> 51:06.092
Best one lately.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.028
Yeah, before long you'll be sleeping

51:08.061 --> 51:09.229
through the night again.

51:09.262 --> 51:11.464
I just keep wondering,

51:13.600 --> 51:16.637
why would someone make
something like that?

51:16.670 --> 51:18.939
Because they can, I suppose.

51:18.972 --> 51:21.608
Some vendetta against God, perhaps.

51:21.642 --> 51:22.475
Hate.

51:23.677 --> 51:25.912
Plain, simple need to hurt others.

51:25.946 --> 51:28.248
They succeeded, didn't they?

51:52.606 --> 51:54.608
Ted, check the laptop.

51:57.611 --> 51:59.713
One is down, two is dirty.

52:01.347 --> 52:02.849
Three is also out.

52:03.650 --> 52:04.685
Cole.

52:14.995 --> 52:17.097
I thought I left it open.

52:19.700 --> 52:20.867
Oh dear God.

52:22.302 --> 52:24.571
Oh shit, there's two of 'em.

52:24.605 --> 52:26.039
Get off of him!

52:31.612 --> 52:33.346
Damn it, it's locked!

52:33.379 --> 52:35.248
You fucking monster!

52:35.716 --> 52:36.316
Cole!

52:37.150 --> 52:38.318
- Stand back.
- Cole, answer me, Cole!

52:38.351 --> 52:40.621
Stand back, stand back.

52:41.287 --> 52:43.590
Help, please.

52:43.624 --> 52:44.691
Thank God.

52:44.725 --> 52:46.559
Ted, check the room.

52:50.096 --> 52:52.633
I thought you said there
was just one entity.

52:52.666 --> 52:55.769
That was the first time I have
ever seen that woman.

52:57.103 --> 52:58.672
There's nothin', they're gone.

52:58.705 --> 53:00.173
It's okay.

53:00.206 --> 53:02.943
Ted, see what else you can find out.

53:02.976 --> 53:05.211
Uh, I think that's a bad idea.

53:05.245 --> 53:07.681
We need to know more about this thing.

53:07.714 --> 53:08.849
You'll be fine.

53:16.657 --> 53:19.159
Oh, this is such a bad idea.

53:21.762 --> 53:23.697
I think it's outside.

53:24.364 --> 53:26.199
There's a light in the case.

53:27.701 --> 53:31.137
Fantastic, there's a light in the case.

53:57.964 --> 53:59.365
Shit, shit, shit.

54:01.067 --> 54:01.902
Damn it.

54:03.103 --> 54:05.872
Turn his head, please.

54:07.941 --> 54:09.275
It fed off of him.

54:09.309 --> 54:11.044
Yeah, they do that.

54:11.978 --> 54:13.747
That's extraordinarily unusual.

54:13.780 --> 54:16.049
Ghosts don't normally feed.

54:28.829 --> 54:29.462
Hey.

54:30.731 --> 54:32.799
No, there's nothin' down here.

54:33.800 --> 54:34.701
I don't know.

54:35.869 --> 54:37.938
I guess I scared it off or something.

54:39.039 --> 54:40.774
Elizabeth, I think I need you.

54:47.914 --> 54:48.749
Oh my.

54:49.482 --> 54:51.417
We should go downstairs.

55:05.398 --> 55:06.232
Oh God.

55:07.000 --> 55:07.901
That's Sam.

55:08.534 --> 55:09.335
Sam.

55:09.369 --> 55:10.203
Sam!

55:11.972 --> 55:14.140
It will consume you all.

55:27.087 --> 55:28.889
Where did she go?

55:29.555 --> 55:30.991
It will consume you all.

55:31.024 --> 55:31.858
Sam.

55:33.259 --> 55:33.927
Sam.

55:35.061 --> 55:36.062
Sam, please.

55:38.264 --> 55:40.100
Jessica, be careful.

55:40.566 --> 55:41.267
Sam.

55:44.037 --> 55:45.038
Sam, please.

55:46.572 --> 55:47.908
Talk to me.

55:57.017 --> 55:57.884
What did I miss?

55:59.152 --> 56:00.153
I saw Sam.

56:04.858 --> 56:06.893
Going in three, two.

56:08.194 --> 56:12.365
We've experienced plenty
of extraordinary phenomena

56:13.233 --> 56:14.968
over the course of our travels.

56:15.001 --> 56:17.503
But last night was historical.

56:18.371 --> 56:19.339
An occurrence so vivid

56:19.372 --> 56:23.309
no one could dare
question its authenticity.

56:24.177 --> 56:26.046
As you have so clearly seen,

56:26.079 --> 56:28.548
I witnessed the supernatural entities

56:28.581 --> 56:31.985
contained in the music box in question,

56:32.018 --> 56:36.189
including the soul of former
owner Samantha Griffin.

56:37.390 --> 56:39.359
But this is more than
an ordinary haunting.

56:39.392 --> 56:40.560
It's an attack.

56:40.593 --> 56:43.029
Warfare on a spiritual level.

56:44.330 --> 56:48.301
Thankfully, they've
entrusted their safety to us.

56:49.435 --> 56:52.873
And I promise you,
it's a war I plan to win.

56:57.177 --> 56:59.379
Too much or too theatrical?

57:00.914 --> 57:02.215
No, it'll be great for the website.

57:02.248 --> 57:03.616
All right, well, let's
present our findings

57:03.649 --> 57:05.251
and then plan for later today.

57:05.285 --> 57:06.953
Are we sure that's the best option?

57:06.987 --> 57:08.154
I'm certain.

57:08.889 --> 57:10.090
But an exorcism?

57:10.123 --> 57:12.258
They've dangerous for us included.

57:13.426 --> 57:14.360
I say we attempt the other two options.

57:14.394 --> 57:16.062
Other two options?

57:17.530 --> 57:19.565
One is a shot in the dark and
the other is an impossibility.

57:19.599 --> 57:22.035
Who in their right minds
would wanna take their place?

57:22.068 --> 57:23.636
Okay, then we get a priest to do it.

57:23.669 --> 57:25.571
What the hell is wrong with you?

57:25.605 --> 57:28.074
This isn't some routine haunting.

57:28.108 --> 57:30.343
I want us to be the ones that stop it.

57:30.376 --> 57:33.646
Elizabeth, you know all bets
are off doing an exorcism.

57:33.679 --> 57:36.016
Even under the best
possible circumstances,

57:36.049 --> 57:37.984
this could end badly.

57:39.685 --> 57:40.486
And I don't know how comfortable I am

57:40.520 --> 57:42.155
with you taking that kind of risk.

57:42.188 --> 57:44.925
I don't care what
you're comfortable with.

57:44.958 --> 57:47.393
This is the sort of
risk that I live for.

57:47.427 --> 57:48.628
This is what we do.

57:48.661 --> 57:49.930
Yeah, and I thought we
were a little bit more

57:49.963 --> 57:50.563
than just come coworkers.

57:50.596 --> 57:52.465
And we are.

57:52.498 --> 57:55.068
But when we're investigating,
I call the shots.

57:55.101 --> 57:55.936
We agreed.

57:57.670 --> 57:59.439
So, I can count on you?

58:02.976 --> 58:03.743
You know me.

58:05.111 --> 58:07.948
I'd follow you to hell if need be.

58:19.259 --> 58:21.461
All good boys want to die.

58:21.494 --> 58:22.996
All good boys want to die.

58:23.029 --> 58:25.198
All good boys want to die.

58:27.067 --> 58:28.701
All good boys want to die.

58:28.734 --> 58:30.670
All good boys want to die.

58:30.703 --> 58:31.938
All good boys want to die.

58:31.972 --> 58:33.273
All good boys want to die.

58:33.306 --> 58:35.041
All good boys want to die.

58:35.075 --> 58:35.675
They're ready.

58:35.708 --> 58:37.043
Just a second.

58:54.760 --> 58:58.498
So, was last night enough of
an experience for you, doctor?

58:58.531 --> 59:00.366
That is an understatement.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.301
Honestly?

59:02.468 --> 59:03.970
I've never been more afraid in my life.

59:04.004 --> 59:05.671
Can you get rid of it?

59:05.705 --> 59:09.675
I'll be frank, I've never
seen anything quite like this.

59:09.709 --> 59:12.212
We're not dealing with a haunting.

59:12.245 --> 59:13.746
It is, in fact, worse.

59:13.779 --> 59:16.016
So, what exactly is worse?

59:16.049 --> 59:17.083
A demon.

59:17.750 --> 59:20.053
A very powerful one, I believe.

59:21.221 --> 59:22.588
It's the only way I
can explain the speed

59:22.622 --> 59:25.191
and complexity of your situation.

59:25.225 --> 59:28.461
Worst of all, it's using
the box to latch onto you.

59:28.494 --> 59:30.096
To feed off of you.

59:31.464 --> 59:32.098
Yeah, it sure got a
piece out of me last night,

59:32.132 --> 59:33.333
now, didn't it?

59:33.366 --> 59:36.569
Not just physically,
but spiritually as well.

59:36.602 --> 59:39.139
This thing is feeding
on your life forces.

59:39.172 --> 59:43.243
And not just when the cameras
catch it, but continuously.

59:43.276 --> 59:45.011
And then there are the others.

59:47.380 --> 59:50.050
You're talking about Samantha.

59:51.117 --> 59:53.253
From last night.

01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:03.096
Oh my God.

01:00:18.444 --> 01:00:19.512
Those poor people.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.715
I'm afraid that's not all.

01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:25.151
Ted, if you would.

01:00:37.697 --> 01:00:39.465
My eyes.

01:00:40.233 --> 01:00:41.467
Someone help me, please.

01:00:42.402 --> 01:00:43.035
My eyes.

01:00:44.137 --> 01:00:46.472
Please, someone just let me die.

01:00:50.143 --> 01:00:51.311
- Please, someone help me.
- Stop it.

01:00:51.344 --> 01:00:52.678
Please.

01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:53.646
If you can hear me...

01:00:53.679 --> 01:00:56.149
I said stop it, goddamnit!

01:00:57.483 --> 01:00:59.485
I'm sorry you had to experience that.

01:00:59.519 --> 01:01:01.354
Why would it do that to her?

01:01:01.387 --> 01:01:03.756
Demons seek to harm, to trap.

01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:05.458
To do anything in their power

01:01:05.491 --> 01:01:09.162
to keep a soul from
traveling to its final rest.

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:10.530
Make no mistake.

01:01:11.397 --> 01:01:13.065
These souls are in agony.

01:01:14.134 --> 01:01:15.868
They are by all account in hell.

01:01:15.901 --> 01:01:18.371
Oh God.

01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:19.739
Can we save her?

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.607
I believe so.

01:01:22.675 --> 01:01:23.876
And more pressingly, you as well.

01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:26.212
Yeah, and how do you plan to do that?

01:01:26.246 --> 01:01:29.182
I believe we should perform an exorcism.

01:01:29.215 --> 01:01:30.116
A what?

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.185
You mean like with a priest?

01:01:32.218 --> 01:01:34.154
The authority to cast
out demons and evil spirits

01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:35.888
doesn't rest within
the archaic structure

01:01:35.921 --> 01:01:37.590
of the Catholic church,

01:01:37.623 --> 01:01:39.192
but in the authority given to Christians

01:01:39.225 --> 01:01:41.327
who are redeemed by the blood of Christ.

01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:42.195
John 1:12.

01:01:43.429 --> 01:01:46.599
Christians have the right to
be called the children of God.

01:01:46.632 --> 01:01:48.201
So, I can help you.

01:01:49.335 --> 01:01:51.137
In fact, she's better than a priest.

01:01:51.171 --> 01:01:53.173
Oh, that's just great.

01:01:54.374 --> 01:01:55.308
She's versed in other
methods of expulsion.

01:01:55.341 --> 01:01:56.909
So if something goes wrong,

01:01:56.942 --> 01:01:59.179
she can adapt, try something else.

01:01:59.212 --> 01:02:00.346
But we're not possessed.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.382
We're not puking up green bile.

01:02:02.415 --> 01:02:04.650
This thing isn't trying to inhabit you.

01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:07.187
It's trying to control you, consume you.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.191
And if we don't separate what
binds you, it will succeed.

01:02:13.259 --> 01:02:16.262
Can you set it in the box, please.

01:02:17.197 --> 01:02:18.698
What's with the salt?

01:02:20.866 --> 01:02:22.868
It acts as a purifier.

01:02:24.304 --> 01:02:25.871
It should lessen
the supernatural activity

01:02:25.905 --> 01:02:26.806
you've been experiencing

01:02:26.839 --> 01:02:30.576
and hopefully weaken
it by this afternoon.

01:02:31.977 --> 01:02:34.914
I should have everything
we need at my office.

01:02:34.947 --> 01:02:35.948
Do you want me to come with you?

01:02:35.981 --> 01:02:37.082
No.

01:02:37.116 --> 01:02:38.651
No, if something happens,
I don't want you to miss it.

01:02:38.684 --> 01:02:40.953
Keep the cameras rolling if you can.

01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:41.887
Got it.

01:02:41.921 --> 01:02:44.257
Everything will be fine.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:45.525
I promise.

01:02:56.469 --> 01:02:57.970
You know what always
makes me feel better?

01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:00.306
Greasy pizza.

01:03:03.743 --> 01:03:05.978
I can't imagine what you
guys have gone through.

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:08.214
Hell, continue to go through.

01:03:08.248 --> 01:03:09.682
Is it gonna be bad?

01:03:09.715 --> 01:03:12.552
It's best not to think about it.

01:03:13.719 --> 01:03:14.654
But when it's over,
you're gonna be free.

01:03:14.687 --> 01:03:16.856
And she can do this?

01:03:16.889 --> 01:03:18.658
The exorcism, I mean.

01:03:19.259 --> 01:03:19.659
She can.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.429
Dr. Harris is an amazing woman.

01:03:25.665 --> 01:03:27.767
There was this young boy.

01:03:30.403 --> 01:03:33.373
He had an imaginary
friend he called Mr. Man.

01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:36.309
It told him to define awful things.

01:03:36.342 --> 01:03:37.443
He burned his dog alive.

01:03:37.477 --> 01:03:40.346
He even tried to stab his
six month old little brother.

01:03:42.448 --> 01:03:44.250
His parents tried doctors and shrinks.

01:03:44.284 --> 01:03:46.686
But Mr. Man always came back.

01:03:48.821 --> 01:03:52.292
Somehow they got our number,
so we investigated.

01:03:52.325 --> 01:03:53.926
Dr. Harris and I performed an exorcism.

01:03:53.959 --> 01:03:57.730
And finally, after several days,
Mr. Man left.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.568
It almost killed Elizabeth.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:09.342
But last I heard, that kid starts
high school next year.

01:04:10.075 --> 01:04:12.445
So try not to sorry about it, okay?

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:14.380
Everything'll work out.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.253
Yep.

01:04:21.921 --> 01:04:23.556
All right, I'll tell them.

01:04:24.657 --> 01:04:27.693
That was the doc,
she'll be back in a few.

01:04:27.727 --> 01:04:30.363
So, who wants the last slice?

01:04:30.796 --> 01:04:31.631
All you.

01:04:54.454 --> 01:04:57.390
All right, let's get this over with.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:04:59.258
Where do you wanna set up?

01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:00.893
Dining room should be sufficient.

01:05:00.926 --> 01:05:02.995
All right, let's do it.

01:05:10.703 --> 01:05:11.837
Let's get this done quickly.

01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:14.306
I wanna do this before night.

01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:17.410
You need anything else?

01:05:17.443 --> 01:05:19.512
Just your absolute trust.

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.985
Ready?

01:05:46.406 --> 01:05:49.909
You know, I haven't had
a moment to cry for Samantha.

01:05:49.942 --> 01:05:51.544
Been so fucking scared for my own life,

01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:55.515
I haven't even really
had a chance to grieve.

01:05:56.048 --> 01:05:57.349
It's understandable.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.585
Doesn't make it right.

01:06:01.454 --> 01:06:02.855
I did this to us.

01:06:05.124 --> 01:06:06.392
I killed her.

01:06:06.859 --> 01:06:07.927
And maybe us.

01:06:08.528 --> 01:06:09.094
No, no.

01:06:09.795 --> 01:06:12.498
Don't do that to yourself, okay.

01:06:13.466 --> 01:06:15.435
This is just a fucked up situation.

01:06:15.468 --> 01:06:17.770
I mean, I can't believe
we are even considering

01:06:17.803 --> 01:06:19.371
a fucking exorcism.

01:06:22.775 --> 01:06:24.810
What's the alternative?

01:06:24.844 --> 01:06:25.678
Die?

01:06:29.749 --> 01:06:33.586
It's just, an exorcism
sounds so fucking mystical,

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:34.754
you know?

01:06:34.787 --> 01:06:37.957
I mean, I was expecting
someone with a PhD

01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:41.494
to give us a more realistic solution.

01:06:45.498 --> 01:06:47.500
I guess unrealistic situations

01:06:47.533 --> 01:06:49.935
call for unrealistic solutions.

01:06:51.036 --> 01:06:51.871
I guess.

01:06:54.106 --> 01:06:58.043
But whatever happens this
afternoon, I love you.

01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:09.522
We're ready.

01:07:09.989 --> 01:07:11.524
Just a second.

01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:25.538
You know, it's not
too late to reconsider.

01:07:25.571 --> 01:07:27.072
Of course it is.

01:07:28.273 --> 01:07:29.709
You just make sure
I look good out there.

01:07:29.742 --> 01:07:33.078
You do a good job of that on your own.

01:07:34.213 --> 01:07:36.682
If it goes wrong, finish the book.

01:07:41.086 --> 01:07:43.155
I'll give this to you
the moment we're done.

01:07:43.188 --> 01:07:47.493
You know I couldn't do
this without you, right?

01:08:02.575 --> 01:08:03.609
Hey dad.

01:08:04.577 --> 01:08:07.580
Yeah, not getting your money's worth.

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:13.485
Just a rough day.

01:08:13.953 --> 01:08:14.787
Pop quiz.

01:08:17.557 --> 01:08:18.591
How's mom?

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:23.796
Good.

01:08:24.764 --> 01:08:25.598
Good.

01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:29.635
Well, um,

01:08:31.636 --> 01:08:32.537
I gotta go.

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:35.006
Plenty to do.

01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:38.510
Okay.

01:08:39.812 --> 01:08:40.645
Bye dad.

01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:51.591
We're ready.

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:10.710
Don't break the circle and
you should be fine.

01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:22.688
I apologize for any discomfort.

01:09:29.862 --> 01:09:31.229
In the name of the...

01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:34.667
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.902
Our father who art in heaven,

01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:40.939
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,

01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:44.877
thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:47.912
Give us this day our daily bread

01:09:47.947 --> 01:09:50.349
and forgive us our trespasses

01:09:51.684 --> 01:09:54.118
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:09:55.755 --> 01:09:58.724
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:09:59.258 --> 01:10:00.092
Amen.

01:10:13.739 --> 01:10:16.075
In the name of God almighty,

01:10:16.108 --> 01:10:19.779
I demand you, release
these children of God.

01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:21.947
God demands it.

01:10:22.748 --> 01:10:23.315
I demand it.

01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:24.650
Free them now.

01:10:35.327 --> 01:10:36.161
Doc.

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:39.431
That just means we have its attention.

01:10:39.464 --> 01:10:41.667
Holy Michael, archangel,

01:10:42.768 --> 01:10:44.737
defend us in this day of battle.

01:10:45.805 --> 01:10:48.440
Be our safeguard against the wickedness

01:10:48.473 --> 01:10:50.676
and snares of the devil.

01:10:51.443 --> 01:10:53.846
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray.

01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:57.983
Thrust down to hell satan
and all other evil spirits

01:10:59.418 --> 01:11:02.788
who wander through the world
seeking the ruin of souls.

01:11:03.188 --> 01:11:04.023
Amen.

01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:15.067
You have no hold over these souls.

01:11:15.968 --> 01:11:18.037
You have no right to that

01:11:19.204 --> 01:11:21.741
which belongs to the one true God.

01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:30.816
Elizabeth.

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.184
Elizabeth, look.

01:11:49.969 --> 01:11:51.737
Hold your ground.

01:11:52.437 --> 01:11:54.339
They're just trying to scare us.

01:11:54.974 --> 01:11:55.741
It's working.

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:57.142
What the fuck.

01:11:57.176 --> 01:11:58.844
Cole, don't move.

01:11:59.378 --> 01:12:00.279
That's what they want.

01:12:00.312 --> 01:12:01.180
What, are you fuckin' nuts?

01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:03.115
Cole, don't leave me.

01:12:03.983 --> 01:12:04.984
You cannot save them.

01:12:05.017 --> 01:12:06.819
You cannot save us.

01:12:07.486 --> 01:12:09.321
You cannot save yourself.

01:12:10.856 --> 01:12:12.324
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

01:12:12.357 --> 01:12:14.359
God is not with you.

01:12:14.393 --> 01:12:15.895
You have no power.

01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:18.864
No, it you who have no power.

01:12:18.898 --> 01:12:21.533
You have made a life of death.

01:12:21.566 --> 01:12:24.003
The light will give you what you seek.

01:12:24.036 --> 01:12:25.404
God is the light.

01:12:25.437 --> 01:12:27.907
You will free these children of God.

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.174
We command you.

01:12:29.574 --> 01:12:31.010
He commands you.

01:12:31.811 --> 01:12:32.978
I command you.

01:12:38.283 --> 01:12:38.951
Go home.

01:12:42.554 --> 01:12:43.755
You're free.

01:12:47.392 --> 01:12:48.227
And you.

01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:52.932
Go back to the hell that spawned you.

01:13:14.854 --> 01:13:16.188
What happened?

01:13:17.422 --> 01:13:18.790
That's over.

01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:21.861
We won.

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:33.906
What will you do with it?

01:13:33.939 --> 01:13:36.475
Figure out a way to destroy it.

01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:38.844
Not 'til we study it.

01:13:38.878 --> 01:13:41.847
It's not tethered to anyone,
so it's harmless at the moment.

01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:43.115
What about Sam?

01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:45.918
Is she gonna be okay?

01:13:46.518 --> 01:13:47.386
She's free.

01:13:48.253 --> 01:13:50.222
I don't know how to thank you.

01:13:51.423 --> 01:13:52.557
Is there anything we
can do to repay you?

01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:55.327
You signed the releases, right?

01:13:56.495 --> 01:13:58.097
Letting us share your
story is thanks enough.

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.931
Yeah.

01:13:58.964 --> 01:14:00.465
I gotta be honest.

01:14:01.566 --> 01:14:02.868
I don't really feel any different.

01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:04.303
You've been through a lot.

01:14:04.336 --> 01:14:06.238
Just give it some time.

01:14:06.638 --> 01:14:08.007
We about ready?

01:14:08.673 --> 01:14:10.442
This is the last of it.

01:14:10.475 --> 01:14:11.610
Just give me a moment.

01:14:11.643 --> 01:14:12.878
Okay.

01:14:24.656 --> 01:14:25.857
Oh my God.

01:14:34.967 --> 01:14:36.001
Ted.

01:14:36.969 --> 01:14:38.170
Ted, get in here!

01:14:38.637 --> 01:14:39.204
Now!

01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:42.107
- Quickly!
- Wait here.

01:14:44.276 --> 01:14:45.110
Elizabeth?

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:46.178
Elizabeth!

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:48.914
Elizabeth!

01:14:50.182 --> 01:14:51.016
Elizabeth!

01:14:52.317 --> 01:14:55.120
Elizabeth!

01:14:55.154 --> 01:14:55.988
Oh no.

01:14:56.655 --> 01:14:58.023
Oh God, no, no.

01:14:58.423 --> 01:14:59.224
No, no, no.

01:14:59.691 --> 01:15:00.325
No.

01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:09.034
They're still in danger.

01:15:52.077 --> 01:15:53.212
How you doing?

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.616
Let's worry about you guys first.

01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:59.151
Cole, you ready?

01:16:00.419 --> 01:16:01.987
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:10.195
All right, so, how can
we fuck this up any more?

01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:13.698
Don't give up yet.

01:16:15.434 --> 01:16:18.037
Dr. Harris shared two
other options with me.

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.903
I sure as shit hope they're better

01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:21.240
than the last one she came up with.

01:16:21.273 --> 01:16:21.906
Cole.

01:16:25.044 --> 01:16:26.511
She died trying to help you.

01:16:26.545 --> 01:16:29.081
We're gonna die from
her trying to help us.

01:16:29.114 --> 01:16:29.748
Cole.

01:16:30.682 --> 01:16:33.452
You're not the only
one who's hurting here.

01:16:34.153 --> 01:16:34.986
Fine.

01:16:35.787 --> 01:16:36.621
I'm sorry.

01:16:43.362 --> 01:16:45.064
As I was saying.

01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:47.732
Dr. Harris shared two other options.

01:16:47.766 --> 01:16:51.536
And why are we
just hearing about them, Ted?

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:53.705
Because they're long shots.

01:16:53.738 --> 01:16:55.207
Oh, that's just great.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.108
They're long shots.

01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:58.077
So, that should be good.

01:16:59.711 --> 01:17:02.814
One, find somebody
willing to take your place.

01:17:02.847 --> 01:17:04.083
Perfect.

01:17:05.084 --> 01:17:06.451
Find someone who deserves
the fucking thing,

01:17:06.485 --> 01:17:08.220
then just give it to them.

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:11.022
No, it doesn't work that way.

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:12.591
If it isn't a willing sacrifice,

01:17:12.624 --> 01:17:13.558
the box will just come back.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:14.759
We didn't know what it was.

01:17:14.793 --> 01:17:17.829
That's because it didn't have
a living victim at the time.

01:17:17.862 --> 01:17:19.498
What's the other?

01:17:19.531 --> 01:17:21.466
Find the person who made the box.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.368
Get 'em to remove the curse.

01:17:23.402 --> 01:17:26.305
We got the box from a yard sale.

01:17:26.338 --> 01:17:30.309
I mean, who knows where
he could have gotten it from?

01:17:33.678 --> 01:17:35.647
Could you find this place again?

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.515
Mm-hmm.

01:17:37.716 --> 01:17:40.252
Wait, so, our lives
depend on a yard sale?

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:42.087
We are fucking dead.

01:17:42.121 --> 01:17:44.589
This is great, I'm fucking done.

01:17:48.527 --> 01:17:49.428
Hey, I know we failed
you up to this point,

01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:50.329
but that doesn't mean it's over.

01:17:53.598 --> 01:17:54.366
Cole, are you okay?

01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:55.200
Am I okay?

01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:57.836
Absolutely not, I'm fuckin' dead, Jess.

01:17:57.869 --> 01:18:00.205
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:01.706
Just give it a day or two.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.108
It'll sink in.

01:18:15.887 --> 01:18:16.721
Cole?

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:26.431
- Cole.
- Go.

01:18:26.898 --> 01:18:27.366
Cole.

01:18:27.832 --> 01:18:28.400
Cole.

01:18:30.535 --> 01:18:31.370
Cole.

01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:32.371
Cole!

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.175
Cole.

01:18:36.808 --> 01:18:37.642
Fuck!

01:18:40.412 --> 01:18:41.246
Cole.

01:18:41.713 --> 01:18:42.181
Cole.

01:18:45.884 --> 01:18:47.186
I'll see you soon.

01:18:50.789 --> 01:18:51.623
Cole.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:52.657
Cole!

01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:54.493
Cole, wake up!

01:18:54.959 --> 01:18:56.195
Cole, no!

01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.796
He's dead.

01:18:59.298 --> 01:19:01.433
Cole.

01:19:01.466 --> 01:19:02.634
Cole, wake up.

01:19:04.203 --> 01:19:04.836
Oh God.

01:19:16.615 --> 01:19:17.816
You okay?

01:19:17.849 --> 01:19:21.886
I'm not even sad anymore.

01:19:23.322 --> 01:19:26.157
I just keep thinking about
the easiest way to do myself in.

01:19:30.262 --> 01:19:30.895
Poison.

01:19:32.931 --> 01:19:34.866
Jump in front of a car.

01:19:36.701 --> 01:19:38.437
Hang myself like Sam.

01:19:40.439 --> 01:19:44.509
Bury myself alive.

01:19:44.543 --> 01:19:45.810
It's funny, I don't wanna die,

01:19:45.844 --> 01:19:48.447
but it's all I can think about.

01:19:49.648 --> 01:19:52.284
All good girls want to die.

01:19:52.951 --> 01:19:54.553
All good girls want to die.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.656
All good girls want to die.

01:19:57.689 --> 01:19:59.524
All good girls want to die.
Let's just go.

01:19:59.558 --> 01:20:01.860
All good girls want to die.

01:20:01.893 --> 01:20:03.895
We're losing daylight.

01:20:28.052 --> 01:20:28.953
Is this it?

01:20:29.688 --> 01:20:31.222
Yeah, this is it.

01:20:42.867 --> 01:20:43.868
Can I help you?

01:20:43.902 --> 01:20:44.969
Yes, sir.

01:20:45.003 --> 01:20:48.907
I had a question about
something my friend bought here.

01:20:50.074 --> 01:20:52.344
It was at a yard sale a few weeks ago.

01:20:52.377 --> 01:20:54.313
Yeah, I remember you.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.882
We're wondering if you could
tell us where it came from.

01:20:57.916 --> 01:21:01.019
I told you, it belonged to my wife.

01:21:02.987 --> 01:21:03.888
Is she home?

01:21:03.922 --> 01:21:05.324
Can we talk to her about it?

01:21:05.357 --> 01:21:06.257
She's dead.

01:21:09.428 --> 01:21:10.529
I'm so sorry.

01:21:10.562 --> 01:21:12.864
She killed herself, didn't she?

01:21:12.897 --> 01:21:14.866
That's none of your business.

01:21:14.899 --> 01:21:16.067
Look, you both should leave.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.336
Now.

01:21:18.102 --> 01:21:19.771
Look, since we've bought this thing,

01:21:19.804 --> 01:21:23.308
three people have killed
themselves, just like your wife.

01:21:23.342 --> 01:21:25.310
That's no coincidence.

01:21:25.344 --> 01:21:26.911
You probably had your suspicions, right?

01:21:26.945 --> 01:21:29.948
Noticed a change in her personality?

01:21:30.415 --> 01:21:31.049
Please.

01:21:32.116 --> 01:21:35.053
You may be the only person
who can save my life.

01:21:35.086 --> 01:21:36.588
All right, fine.

01:21:37.121 --> 01:21:37.956
Come in.

01:21:47.466 --> 01:21:48.733
I apologize for the mess.

01:21:48.767 --> 01:21:51.102
I don't get much company these days.

01:21:51.135 --> 01:21:52.804
Please, have a seat.

01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:57.709
Can I get either of
you something to drink?

01:21:57.742 --> 01:21:59.077
Oh, no thanks.

01:21:59.944 --> 01:22:01.112
Well, I need something.

01:22:01.145 --> 01:22:03.715
So, if you'll excuse me for a moment.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:08.453
Well, that went well.

01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:12.824
Honestly, I expected him
to slam the door in our faces.

01:22:16.828 --> 01:22:20.832
Let's just see what he knows,
get out of here.

01:22:22.534 --> 01:22:23.468
So.

01:22:24.969 --> 01:22:27.806
You think that little box
killed my wife, huh?

01:22:27.839 --> 01:22:28.840
Yes, I do.

01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:31.075
You know how that sounds?

01:22:31.109 --> 01:22:32.544
Crazy, we know.

01:22:34.012 --> 01:22:36.715
But the thing inside that box
makes people hurt themselves.

01:22:36.748 --> 01:22:38.550
My best friend hung herself.

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:41.085
My boyfriend poisoned himself.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.621
Dr. Harris, she...

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:44.589
We found her with her wrists slit.

01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:46.124
Look, I'm sorry.

01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:47.592
Sincerely, I am.

01:22:53.164 --> 01:22:54.365
But you see,

01:22:57.001 --> 01:22:59.370
my wife electrocuted herself.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.942
She didn't do that to herself.

01:23:03.975 --> 01:23:05.644
Of course she did.

01:23:06.811 --> 01:23:08.880
No, you haven't seen this thing.

01:23:08.913 --> 01:23:10.982
It's an ugly, horrible thing
that feeds on people

01:23:11.015 --> 01:23:12.150
until there's nothin' left.

01:23:12.183 --> 01:23:13.017
Stop it.

01:23:17.622 --> 01:23:20.459
My wife did this to herself, okay.

01:23:22.594 --> 01:23:26.397
Not because some little girl
forced her to.

01:23:27.198 --> 01:23:29.701
Now, look, I think it's time
you both should go.

01:23:29.734 --> 01:23:30.569
Please.

01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:33.505
Let me mourn the loss
of my wife in peace.

01:23:33.538 --> 01:23:36.541
But how did you know
it was a little girl?

01:23:36.575 --> 01:23:37.976
You saw her, too.

01:23:42.213 --> 01:23:44.883
That little girl is my daughter.

01:23:50.522 --> 01:23:51.556
- Don't.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:52.524
All right, all right, all right.

01:23:52.557 --> 01:23:53.558
Sit.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:23:54.425
All right.

01:23:56.728 --> 01:23:57.596
You knew.

01:23:58.997 --> 01:23:59.831
How?

01:24:01.132 --> 01:24:04.703
You see, God took
my little girl from me.

01:24:06.605 --> 01:24:10.475
So I had to go to somebody else
to bring her back.

01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:14.613
All I had to do was to prove
how much I hated God

01:24:15.547 --> 01:24:17.448
for taking her from us.

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:21.653
Believe me, I was glad to prove it.

01:24:22.521 --> 01:24:24.523
She killed my friends.

01:24:25.657 --> 01:24:27.526
My little girl has killed
a lot of people.

01:24:27.559 --> 01:24:29.127
So you've done this before?

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:29.994
Oh yeah.

01:24:30.729 --> 01:24:32.130
Quite a few times.

01:24:33.164 --> 01:24:35.667
Unfortunately, it's necessary.

01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:38.703
You are just as much
of a monster as she is.

01:24:38.737 --> 01:24:39.571
No.

01:24:41.005 --> 01:24:42.106
I'm a father.

01:24:44.308 --> 01:24:47.111
You see, once the deed is done,

01:24:49.814 --> 01:24:53.652
my little girl always
comes back to her daddy.

01:24:56.655 --> 01:24:57.589
Sometimes...

01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:03.595
Sometimes I'll find her
in there playing.

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:10.501
So you wanna find somebody
to free you from it, right?

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:12.837
Some way to save yourself?

01:25:13.638 --> 01:25:14.673
Well, I won't.

01:25:19.744 --> 01:25:21.646
So you just let this
thing kill your wife?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.648
She didn't kill my wife.

01:25:24.716 --> 01:25:25.917
Nancy wanted that.

01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:28.519
She wanted the be with her child.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.520
Now get up.

01:25:31.823 --> 01:25:32.657
Get up.

01:25:39.363 --> 01:25:41.633
I'll see you soon, honey.

01:25:47.706 --> 01:25:50.008
So you're just gonna let me die?

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:52.977
Oh, you're already dead, sweetie.

01:25:54.145 --> 01:25:55.747
You see, my little girl's attracted

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.583
to the younger people, you know.

01:25:59.818 --> 01:26:03.655
Especially those that take
their lives for granted.

01:26:05.056 --> 01:26:08.559
You see, the more
she looks like my little girl,

01:26:09.227 --> 01:26:11.162
the closer to death you are.

01:26:13.698 --> 01:26:15.233
You want some advice?

01:26:15.834 --> 01:26:16.300
Kill her.

01:26:18.069 --> 01:26:19.337
That way she might have a chance

01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:21.806
of at least keeping her soul.

01:26:23.341 --> 01:26:25.343
Now get out of my house.

01:26:28.012 --> 01:26:30.014
All right, okay.

01:26:37.388 --> 01:26:38.356
All good girls want to die.

01:26:38.389 --> 01:26:40.124
All good girls want to die.

01:26:40.158 --> 01:26:42.627
All good girls want to die.

01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:43.928
(music grows more tense

01:26:43.962 --> 01:26:45.730
I will shoot you.

01:26:47.431 --> 01:26:48.266
Do it.

01:26:49.768 --> 01:26:52.036
You'll be doing me a favor.

01:26:57.408 --> 01:26:58.710
What's the matter?

01:27:02.246 --> 01:27:05.750
Little girl won't let you get in
the way of its meal?

01:27:05.784 --> 01:27:06.718
Jess, don't do this.

01:27:06.751 --> 01:27:07.585
Think about it.

01:27:07.618 --> 01:27:08.753
All good boys want to die.

01:27:08.787 --> 01:27:10.021
I have.

01:27:10.054 --> 01:27:10.955
All good boys want to die.

01:27:10.989 --> 01:27:11.823
All good boys want to die.

01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:12.991
It stole my friends.

01:27:13.024 --> 01:27:14.258
Please, no, my little girl, she needs...

01:27:17.228 --> 01:27:17.896
No, Jess!

01:27:18.596 --> 01:27:20.899
What the hell were you thinking?

01:27:23.735 --> 01:27:24.368
Let go.

01:27:25.737 --> 01:27:26.938
Come on, come on,
we have to go right now.

01:27:26.971 --> 01:27:27.806
Go, go!

01:27:48.492 --> 01:27:49.828
I miss you, doc.

01:27:52.764 --> 01:27:54.966
I don't know how to save her.

01:28:00.504 --> 01:28:02.841
What would you do, doc?

01:28:37.909 --> 01:28:38.743
Jessica?

01:28:57.228 --> 01:28:58.029
Jessica?

01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:28.292
Jess, Jess!

01:29:29.894 --> 01:29:31.830
All good girls want to die.

01:29:31.863 --> 01:29:33.965
All good girls want to die.

01:29:33.998 --> 01:29:36.500
- Jessica, please talk to me.
- All good girls want to die.

01:29:36.534 --> 01:29:38.569
There's nothing left to talk about.

01:29:38.602 --> 01:29:41.172
- All good girls want to die.
- I'm going to burn.

01:29:41.205 --> 01:29:42.006
Oh Jess, come on.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:42.941
Jess, Jess.

01:29:42.974 --> 01:29:44.375
Jess, please, let me fix this.

01:29:44.408 --> 01:29:45.844
Jess!

01:29:45.877 --> 01:29:47.846
All good girls want to die.

01:29:47.879 --> 01:29:49.814
All good girls want to die.

01:29:57.421 --> 01:29:58.789
Then fix it.

01:30:03.928 --> 01:30:06.898
All good girls want to die.

01:30:06.931 --> 01:30:09.868
All good girls want to die.

01:30:09.901 --> 01:30:10.869
I can't do that.

01:30:10.902 --> 01:30:11.836
Wait, Jess.

01:30:13.004 --> 01:30:15.373
- Jess, wait.
- All good girls want to die.

01:30:15.406 --> 01:30:17.141
All good girls want to die.

01:30:17.175 --> 01:30:19.443
All good girls want to die.

01:30:20.178 --> 01:30:21.412
Thank you, Ted.

01:30:21.445 --> 01:30:22.346
All good girls want to die.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.415
All good girls want to die.

01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:27.886
All good girls want to die.

01:30:29.187 --> 01:30:33.357
All good girls want to die.

01:30:36.494 --> 01:30:38.963
All good girls want to die.

01:30:40.264 --> 01:30:43.467
- All good girls want to die.
- Oh God, please forgive me.

01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:46.504
All good girls want to die.

01:30:47.238 --> 01:30:48.506
All good girls...

01:30:49.941 --> 01:30:50.841
Fuck!

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:53.111
- All good girls want to die.
- I can't do it.

01:30:53.144 --> 01:30:54.112
I can't do it.

01:30:55.646 --> 01:30:57.648
- All good girls want to die.
- Fire it is, then.

01:30:57.681 --> 01:30:58.482
Jessica.

01:31:00.218 --> 01:31:01.619
It's still your life.

01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:08.326
- All good girls want to die.
- Jess, it's still your life.

01:31:08.359 --> 01:31:09.327
Let's figure this out.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.528
Come on, Jess.

01:31:16.935 --> 01:31:19.938
All good girls want to die.

01:31:21.005 --> 01:31:22.873
All good girls want to die.

01:31:27.946 --> 01:31:29.547
Jessica, give me the box.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.414
No.

01:31:32.516 --> 01:31:33.684
No, I couldn't.

01:31:33.717 --> 01:31:34.953
It's the only way.

01:31:34.986 --> 01:31:37.989
I couldn't let you do that for me.

01:31:40.491 --> 01:31:42.160
It's already done.

01:31:44.228 --> 01:31:47.999
When the police come,
blame everything on me.

01:31:48.032 --> 01:31:50.634
Carl, Cole and Dr. Harris, everything.

01:31:50.668 --> 01:31:51.502
But why?

01:31:53.737 --> 01:31:55.339
You hardly know me?

01:32:00.678 --> 01:32:02.947
I have a promise to keep.

01:32:13.557 --> 01:32:15.026
No.

01:32:17.095 --> 01:32:18.596
It's okay, Jess.

01:32:21.365 --> 01:32:22.200
Ted.

01:32:31.442 --> 01:32:32.276
Hey dad.

01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:34.112
No, I'm okay.

01:32:35.579 --> 01:32:36.414
I'm okay.

01:32:39.317 --> 01:32:41.652
I'll be home in a few hours.

01:32:44.322 --> 01:32:46.557
Probably not next semester.

01:32:47.025 --> 01:32:47.625
No.

01:32:48.892 --> 01:32:53.164
No, there's something more
important I need to do right now.

01:32:55.066 --> 01:32:56.067
Okay, yeah.

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.368
I'll see you soon.

01:32:58.269 --> 01:32:59.103
Bye.
