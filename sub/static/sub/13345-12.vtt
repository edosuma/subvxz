WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:11.712
( phone ringing )

00:20.221 --> 00:22.090
- ( beeps )
- HELLO?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.692
Paul, it's April.

00:24.792 --> 00:28.462
- OH.
- Can I come in
a little early today?

00:28.562 --> 00:31.332
I've been up
all night trying to
finish my final project

00:31.432 --> 00:33.901
and I just don't think
I'll make it to noon.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.304
OH, SURE.
CAN YOU JUST--

00:36.404 --> 00:38.106
JUST HOLD ON
FOR A MOMENT

00:38.206 --> 00:40.174
WHILE I GET MY BOOK.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.410
- UMM--
- No, it's no big deal.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.978
I'll just
see you next week.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.647
NO NO NO NO NO,
IT'S OKAY.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.717
WHEN DID YOU--
WHEN DID YOU WANT
TO COME IN?

00:49.817 --> 00:52.286
How about now?

00:53.221 --> 00:56.224
OKAY.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.726
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A BIT THEN, OKAY?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.764
( theme music playing )

01:22.250 --> 01:24.118
THANKS FOR SEEING ME.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.288
I WAS ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL
TO TURN THIS IN--

01:27.388 --> 01:30.191
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DID IT,

01:30.291 --> 01:31.959
BUT I CAME HERE INSTEAD.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.994
THIS IS...
( clears throat )

01:34.094 --> 01:36.564
THE BIG PROJECT
YOU MENTIONED?

01:39.267 --> 01:41.269
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I HAD A LOOK AT IT?

01:41.369 --> 01:44.605
NO, GO AHEAD IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN SHIT.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.348
- IT--
- OH.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.452
AH.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.128
OH, THAT'S REALLY COOL.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.098
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A WORLD TRADE CENTER MEMORIAL,

02:11.199 --> 02:13.301
OF COURSE.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.103
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"OF COURSE"?

02:16.204 --> 02:18.306
BECAUSE GOD FORBID
ANY ARCHITECTURE STUDENT

02:18.406 --> 02:20.774
IN THE COUNTRY GETS ANOTHER
ASSIGNMENT EVER AGAIN.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.378
I'M SORRY.
I'M AN ASSHOLE.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.014
- DON'T LISTEN TO ME.
- NO, I THINK IT'S JUST--

02:27.114 --> 02:28.782
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.053
IT'S REALLY...

02:33.153 --> 02:35.423
EXQUISITELY DONE.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.359
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.295
I'M SO TIRED.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.264
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING THIS WEEK?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.733
NO, NOT AT ALL.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.602
BETWEEN MY ANXIETY

02:48.702 --> 02:50.338
AND MY LYMPHOMA

02:50.438 --> 02:52.706
THERE'S JUST NEVER
A GOOD TIME.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.577
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A JOKE.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.747
- WAS IT FUNNY?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.684
YEAH...
NEITHER DO I.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.661
CAN I JUST--
DO YOU MIND?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.498
( sighs )

03:17.598 --> 03:19.700
I TRIED SO HARD
TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.304
IT WAS 2:00 A.M.,
I WAS OUT OF IDEAS

03:23.404 --> 03:26.006
AND MY HANDS WERE
SHAKING SO BADLY.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.141
I WAS AFRAID
I'D WRECK THE WHOLE THING

03:28.242 --> 03:30.210
IF I TRIED
TO KEEP WORKING ON IT,

03:30.311 --> 03:32.313
SO I PUT IT IN THE BOX.

03:32.413 --> 03:36.016
I CHANGED MY SHEETS,
I LIT CANDLES,

03:36.116 --> 03:37.851
PUT ON MUSIC.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.856
IT SOUNDS LIKE I WAS
TRYING TO SEDUCE MYSELF.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.525
( chuckles )

03:44.625 --> 03:47.661
SO DID YOU EVENTUALLY
FALL ASLEEP?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.098
I COULDN'T.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.367
MY HEART WAS RACING

03:53.467 --> 03:56.904
AND IT FELT LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.106
IT FELT LIKE IT WASN'T BLOOD
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS,

03:59.206 --> 04:02.476
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE--
FIRE, POISON.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.479
IT-- I JUST--
I WANTED

04:05.579 --> 04:08.282
TO OPEN MYSELF UP
AND GET IT ALL OUT SOMEHOW--

04:08.382 --> 04:11.819
SLIT MY WRISTS
OR TAKE OFF MY OWN HEAD.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.021
NO, I--

04:14.121 --> 04:16.424
I WOULD NEVER.
DON'T WORRY.

04:16.524 --> 04:20.428
I'M JUST TRYING TO
DESCRIBE HOW IT FELT.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.130
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A TERRIBLE NIGHT.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.232
I CAN'T HAVE
ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.301
I WILL LOSE MY MIND.

04:27.401 --> 04:31.739
WHEN YOU SAID THAT
THE POISON WAS RUNNING
THROUGH YOUR VEINS,

04:31.839 --> 04:33.774
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT
I THOUGHT OF IMMEDIATELY?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.510
- CHEMO.
- CANCER.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.980
- SAME THING.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.651
YOU CAN CHOOSE
NOT TO HAVE CHEMO.

04:44.952 --> 04:49.457
OKAY.  TOUCHE.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.191
I HAD THIS THOUGHT
LAST NIGHT--

04:51.291 --> 04:53.827
I JUST KEPT
THINKING IT OVER AND OVER.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.730
IT USED TO HAPPEN TO ME
A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.534
THE SUMMER BEFORE
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.503
I GOT THIS SONG
STUCK IN MY HEAD

05:02.603 --> 05:04.638
AND I COULDN'T
GET IT OUT.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.207
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GOING INSANE.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.042
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD FEEL LIKE

05:09.142 --> 05:11.679
TO GO INSANE?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.681
LIKE FALLING...

05:13.781 --> 05:15.749
INTO NOTHING.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.956
CAN WE NOT TALK
ABOUT LOSING MY MIND?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.793
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
TELL ME ABOUT THE THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD LAST NIGHT,

05:25.893 --> 05:28.696
THE ONE THAT YOU COULDN'T
GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD?

05:30.197 --> 05:32.366
I WANTED TO GO HOME.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.704
I REALLY WISHED
I COULD GO HOME.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.940
AND THEN I THOUGHT

05:40.040 --> 05:42.142
"YOU CAN'T GO HOME.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.145
YOUR HOME IS
SO LONG AGO

05:45.245 --> 05:47.347
AND SO FAR AWAY."

05:47.448 --> 05:49.717
AND THEN
I JUST KEPT THINKING

05:49.817 --> 05:52.019
"YOUR HOME IS
SO LONG AGO

05:52.119 --> 05:54.488
AND SO FAR AWAY.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.490
YOUR HOME IS
SO LONG AGO

05:56.590 --> 05:59.192
AND SO FAR AWAY."

05:59.292 --> 06:01.462
AND THIS HOME
THAT YOU'RE--

06:01.562 --> 06:03.964
THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT,
WHERE IS IT?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.634
OR WAS IT?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.604
CAN I--

06:10.704 --> 06:12.873
CAN I TELL YOU
IN A MOMENT?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
I MEAN...

06:15.108 --> 06:18.479
CAN I JUST--
I JUST NEED TO CLOSE
MY EYES FOR A SECOND.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.948
I'M SO TIRED.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.351
WHAT TIME IS IT?

06:24.452 --> 06:27.455
- 8:00.
- REALLY? ALREADY?

06:27.555 --> 06:29.757
WELL, IT'S...

06:29.857 --> 06:32.760
7:59 ACTUALLY.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.263
PERFECT.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.232
COULD YOU--
COULD YOU WAKE ME

06:39.332 --> 06:41.101
AT 8:00.
WOULD YOU MIND?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.704
SURE.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.570
APRIL.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.687
APRIL.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.627
( whispers )
APRIL, WAKE UP.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.696
WAKE UP, APRIL.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.569
APRIL.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.939
APRIL, WAKE UP.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.481
WHAT TIME IS IT?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.853
IT'S 8:00.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.091
GOOD.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.926
IT'S OVER.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.997
THIS PROJECT WAS
DUE YESTERDAY

08:17.097 --> 08:18.632
BUT MY PROFESSOR SAID

08:18.732 --> 08:21.802
WE HAD UNTIL
8:00 IN THE MORNING
TO TURN IT IN.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.748
( breathing heavily )

09:22.696 --> 09:24.732
IT WAS HIDEOUS.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.635
IT LOOKS BETTER NOW.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.337
PAUL:
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

09:30.437 --> 09:32.305
APRIL:
IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.675
THE DIMENSIONS
WERE ALL OFF.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.145
I RELIED TOO MUCH
ON NEGATIVE SPACE.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.081
IT WAS JUST
SITTING THERE.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.316
I COULDN'T
MAKE IT SOAR.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.789
I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, IT'S--

09:50.257 --> 09:53.727
IT'S VERY HARD
TO SEE YOU DESTROY
YOUR OWN WORK.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.265
I DID--

09:58.365 --> 09:59.733
I DID FALL ASLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.669
I JUST REMEMBERED
A DREAM I HAD.

10:01.769 --> 10:05.105
I WAS ON TOP OF THE MODEL,
BUT IT WAS LIFE-SIZE,

10:05.205 --> 10:08.408
AND I FELL.
DO YOU EVER GET THOSE?

10:08.508 --> 10:10.543
FALLING DREAMS?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.212
SURE.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.447
I GET THOSE
ALL THE TIME.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.785
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU WAKE UP?

10:17.885 --> 10:21.021
I DON'T KNOW.
MY HEART IS POUNDING,

10:21.121 --> 10:23.056
AND I FEEL LIKE--

10:23.156 --> 10:25.859
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.796
IT'S--
IT'S A KIND OF JOY.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.864
SO, DIFFERENT FROM

10:30.964 --> 10:33.533
FALLING INTO NOTHING?

10:33.633 --> 10:37.137
- YEAH.
- SO FALLING IS SOMETHING

10:37.237 --> 10:39.707
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF

10:39.807 --> 10:43.811
AND YET YOU'RE ATTRACTED
TO IT AT THE SAME TIME.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.479
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.515
WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE,
YOU WORK SO HARD TO KEEP

10:48.615 --> 10:50.550
EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING
UNDER YOUR CONTROL,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.320
SO IN YOUR DREAMS

10:53.420 --> 10:56.890
IT MAKES SENSE THAT
YOU FIND YOURSELF
FINALLY FALLING,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.959
RELEASING EVERYTHING,
LETTING EVERYTHING GO,

10:59.059 --> 11:00.928
BECAUSE IT'S A KIND
OF FANTASY FOR YOU.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.698
WHY-- WHY ARE
YOU TELLING ME THAT?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.499
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.368
IT'LL ONLY HELP YOU
IF IT RINGS TRUE.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.103
- IF IT DOESN'T--
- BUT IT'S IN MY HEAD NOW.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.572
YOU PUT IT IN MY HEAD.
NOW I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.374
LIKE THAT THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD LAST NIGHT.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.009
- WHAT?
- YOU STARTED THINKING

11:16.109 --> 11:17.610
ABOUT SOMETHING
AND YOU CAN'T STOP.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.980
YOUR THOUGHTS
BECOME OBSESSIVE.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.818
DON'T SAY THAT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:24.918 --> 11:29.422
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
ON A SUBWAY CAR
THAT BREAKS DOWN

11:29.522 --> 11:31.825
AND THERE'S SOME GUY--

11:31.925 --> 11:35.195
SOME SHY-LOOKING KID
WHO STARTS REPEATING
SOMETHING TO HIMSELF

11:35.295 --> 11:38.098
OVER AND OVER, LIKE,
"7:15, 59th AND LEX.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.533
7:15, 59th AND LEX,"
OVER AND OVER,

11:40.633 --> 11:44.237
LOUDER AND LOUDER
UNTIL JUST SAYING
THE WORDS ISN'T ENOUGH

11:44.337 --> 11:48.008
AND HE STARTS
HITTING HIMSELF
AND THRASHING AROUND

11:48.108 --> 11:50.477
AND FINALLY HAS TO BE
SUBDUED AND TRANQUILIZED?

11:50.577 --> 11:53.446
THAT IS WHAT
IT MEANS TO HAVE
OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.251
I JUST LIKE THINKING
THINGS THROUGH.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.555
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.025
I'VE NOTICED THAT
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY

12:05.125 --> 12:07.460
TRYING TO FEEL
WHAT HE FEELS.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.562
WELL, HE CAN'T DESCRIBE
HOW HE FEELS,

12:09.662 --> 12:12.699
SO HE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO INTERPRET IT FOR HIM.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.701
YOUR EMPATHY IS--

12:14.802 --> 12:16.103
IT'S ADMIRABLE, APRIL.

12:16.203 --> 12:20.540
BUT IT CAN BE
REALLY DRAINING

12:20.640 --> 12:25.045
TRYING TO FEEL
EVERYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.350
MAYBE INSTEAD
OF YOUR OWN.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.960
I DON'T--
I'M SORRY

12:40.060 --> 12:41.995
FOR LOSING MY TEMPER.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.799
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.407
I DID FALL OUT
OF A BUILDING ONCE.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.909
WHEN?

12:56.009 --> 12:59.146
WE WERE
ON VACATION IN MIAMI.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.181
I WAS ONLY 10.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.819
MY MOTHER IS
OBSESSED WITH CUBA--

13:05.919 --> 13:08.922
CUBAN MUSIC,

13:09.022 --> 13:11.024
CUBAN FOOD,
CUBAN CULTURE.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.995
ANYWAY,
WE WERE DOWN THERE

13:15.095 --> 13:17.430
WITHOUT MY BROTHER.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.932
WE LEFT HIM--

13:19.032 --> 13:20.934
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
I THINK--

13:21.034 --> 13:22.602
WITH MY GRANDPARENTS;

13:22.702 --> 13:25.105
JUST ME AND MY FOLKS.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.040
I REMEMBER
THIS ONE NIGHT

13:27.140 --> 13:30.177
THERE WAS A BAND PLAYING
CUBAN MUSIC DOWN BELOW

13:30.277 --> 13:33.780
AND MY PARENTS
STARTED TO DANCE

13:33.881 --> 13:37.484
RIGHT THERE
IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.619
I WENT OVER
TO THE WINDOW

13:39.719 --> 13:42.055
SO THAT I COULD
WATCH THEM DANCE

13:42.155 --> 13:45.492
AND FEEL THE BREEZE
FROM THE OCEAN

13:45.592 --> 13:47.560
ON MY BACK
AT THE SAME TIME.

13:49.863 --> 13:54.467
SOMEHOW--
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENED--

13:56.003 --> 13:58.338
I FELL OUT THE WINDOW.

13:58.438 --> 14:02.109
I MUST'VE JUST
LEANED BACK AND FALLEN.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.946
I LANDED ON THE--
WHAT'S THE WORD?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.982
--THE AWNING
ONE FLOOR BELOW.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.551
I MEAN, I WAS FINE.
I JUST LAID THERE
FOR A SECOND,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.786
I LOOKED UP
AT THE WINDOW

14:13.887 --> 14:15.956
AND THEN I SLID OFF

14:16.056 --> 14:18.225
AND LANDED
ON THE SIDEWALK.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.594
DO YOU REMEMBER
FEELING FRIGHTENED?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.033
I REMEMBER

14:26.133 --> 14:28.801
AS SOON AS MY FEET
HIT THE SIDEWALK

14:28.902 --> 14:32.405
I STARTED TO BAWL.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.042
THEN I WALKED BACK
INTO THE HOTEL AND
I RODE THE ELEVATOR UP.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.845
I LOOKED
IN THE MIRROR

14:38.946 --> 14:41.148
AND I MADE MYSELF
STOP CRYING.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.383
SO YOU COULD
STOP CRYING,

14:43.483 --> 14:45.752
JUST-- JUST LIKE THAT?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.921
I JUST LOOKED
AT MYSELF AND I SAID,

14:48.021 --> 14:50.857
"APRIL,
YOU HAVE TO STOP,"

14:50.958 --> 14:52.892
AND I DID.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.528
I CAN STILL DO THAT.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.900
WHEN I WALKED BACK
INTO THE ROOM,

15:01.001 --> 15:03.670
MY MOTHER...

15:03.770 --> 15:06.173
HAD HER HEAD
ON MY DAD'S SHOULDER.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.209
THEY WERE STILL DANCING

15:09.309 --> 15:11.544
THEY HADN'T NOTICED
YOU WERE GONE?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.148
NO.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.352
WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO STOP CRYING?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.155
- WHAT?
- I MEAN, YOU WERE
10 YEARS OF AGE,

15:22.255 --> 15:24.057
YOU HAD FALLEN
OUT THE WINDOW.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.792
WHY COULDN'T YOU CRY
TO YOUR MOTHER?

15:25.892 --> 15:28.828
SHE WAS SO HAPPY.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.600
THE WAY SHE HELD
MY FATHER IN THAT ROOM,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.802
THE WAY THEY SWAYED,

15:35.902 --> 15:40.173
MY MOTHER CLOSED
HER EYES AS THEY SWAYED.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.110
MY MOTHER NEVER
CLOSES HER EYES.

15:43.210 --> 15:47.247
- WHY NOT?
- SHE CAN'T TAKE THEM
OFF DANIEL.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.053
I'M NOT
AN EMPATHETIC PERSON.
I'M REALLY NOT.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.994
YOU ASKED ME WHERE

16:01.094 --> 16:03.630
HOME WAS FOR ME.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.001
IT WAS THERE

16:08.935 --> 16:11.204
IN MIAMI. THAT--

16:11.304 --> 16:14.541
THAT'S THE PLACE
I WANT TO GO BACK TO--

16:14.641 --> 16:17.177
THAT ROOM

16:17.277 --> 16:20.447
- WITH MY PARENTS.
- WITHOUT DANIEL.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.715
RIGHT.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.453
DID YOU EVER READ
THAT BOOK "ON THE BEACH"?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.122
IT'S ABOUT
THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST

16:29.222 --> 16:32.425
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE
WAITING FOR THE RADIATION

16:32.525 --> 16:34.894
TO REACH AUSTRALIA,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.863
BUT THEY'RE HAPPY.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.199
THEY FALL IN LOVE.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.368
THEY BUY BENCHES
FOR THEIR GARDENS.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.771
THEY DON'T THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.975
I WAS READING THAT
WHILE WE WERE DOWN THERE.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.111
YOU WERE READING
THAT BOOK AT AGE 10?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.346
I USED TO
BE PRECOCIOUS.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.516
AND THAT'S WHAT
I HAD HOPED WOULD HAPPEN--

16:58.218 --> 17:00.387
A NUCLEAR WAR
WOULD DESTROY

17:00.487 --> 17:02.522
EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD,

17:02.622 --> 17:07.694
AND WE COULD JUST
STAY ON THE BEACH.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.930
WE COULDN'T STAY.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.466
WE HAD TO GET BACK.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.306
DANIEL HAD STOPPED EATING,
GONE BACK TO HITTING HIMSELF.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.542
MY GRANDPARENTS CALLED
IN A PANIC.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.179
MY MOTHER WENT
TO THE AIRPORT AND GOT
THE NEXT FLIGHT HOME.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.282
MY DAD AND I DROVE
BACK THAT NIGHT.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.918
DANIEL WOULDN'T
EVEN LOOK AT US.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.187
HE COULDN'T SPEAK.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.357
IT WAS LIKE WE HAD
SET HIM BACK THREE YEARS.

17:39.292 --> 17:43.230
MY MOTHER NEVER FORGAVE
HERSELF FOR THAT TRIP.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.998
APRIL...

17:46.099 --> 17:47.934
YOU ARE
AN EMPATHIC PERSON--

17:48.034 --> 17:50.069
THE WAY YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.071
THE COMPASSION
YOU FEEL FOR HIM.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.141
BUT YOU CAN BE
AN EMPATHIC PERSON

17:54.241 --> 17:56.176
AND STILL FEEL
CONTRADICTORY EMOTIONS,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.178
STILL FEEL ANGER,

17:58.278 --> 18:00.947
STILL FEEL JEALOUSY.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.417
WHY-- WHY WOULD
I BE JEALOUS OF DANIEL?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.687
MAYBE BECAUSE
YOUR MOTHER NEVER
CLOSES HER EYES TO HIM.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.859
DANIEL WAS ALLOWED
TO SHOW YOUR PARENTS
HOW HE WAS FEELING.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.428
WHEN HE GOT UPSET,
HURT OR SCARED,
THEY KNEW IT,

18:15.528 --> 18:17.130
WHEREAS YOU HAD
TO BE PERFECT.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.399
YOU FELL OUT A WINDOW
AND YOUR MOTHER HAD NO IDEA.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.934
YOU CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR THAT.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.603
JESUS, DON'T TALK
ABOUT HER LIKE THAT.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.039
- HOW AM I TALKING ABOUT HER?
- AS IF SHE WAS A BAD MOTHER.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.775
SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.610
SHE GAVE ME
MY CONFIDENCE,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.846
TOLD ME HOW SMART I WAS.
SHE MADE ME FEEL

18:33.946 --> 18:35.748
- LIKE I COULD DO ANYTHING.
- BUT MAYBE AS A CHILD,

18:35.848 --> 18:37.750
YOU TOOK THAT TO MEAN
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
DEPEND ON HER

18:37.850 --> 18:39.852
THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF IT
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.588
- I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS.
- WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOING TO DO?

18:41.688 --> 18:44.257
SLAM MY MOTHER.
SHE MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN PERFECT,

18:44.357 --> 18:46.859
BUT SHE DID HER BEST.
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN

18:46.959 --> 18:48.528
A PROFESSIONAL BALLERINA.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.663
SHE TRAINED AT JUILLIARD,
BUT SHE GAVE ALL OF THAT UP

18:50.763 --> 18:53.132
SO THAT DANIEL COULD
HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE
OF A NORMAL LIFE...

18:53.233 --> 18:57.069
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- ...THAT HE COULD

18:57.170 --> 18:59.472
NOT FEEL
LIKE SUCH A FREAK.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.442
SO DON'T SIT THERE
AND TELL ME SHE MADE
ALL THESE MISTAKES.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.212
- I'M NOT. I'M--
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.113
APRIL, I'M NOT ATTACKING
YOUR MOTHER.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.615
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

19:08.715 --> 19:10.250
WHY YOU CAN'T TELL HER
THAT YOU'RE SICK.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.385
WELL, HOW MUCH MORE
CAN SHE TAKE?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.321
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THAT SHE HAD TO DEAL
WITH DANIEL.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.389
LATELY DANIEL HAS BEEN
DOING SO MUCH BETTER.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.725
SHE FINALLY HAS
SOME TIME ON HER HANDS.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.394
HE'S LIVING
IN THIS GROUP SITUATION,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.763
HE'S GOT A JOB
AT THE LIBRARY
STACKING BOOKS,

19:23.863 --> 19:26.866
AND SHE HAS STARTED
TO TEACH A DANCE CLASS
FOR LITTLE KIDS.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.169
I WENT TO MEET HER THERE.
SHE IS HAVING SUCH
A GREAT TIME.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.038
I AM NOT GONNA TAKE
THAT AWAY FROM HER.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.040
DO YOU THINK THAT
BEING SICK WILL DO THAT?

19:34.140 --> 19:35.808
SHE WOULD STOP
TEACHING THE CLASS.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.044
SHE'D THINK SHE HAS
TO DROP EVERYTHING
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.479
MAYBE THAT'S OKAY
IF SHE DOES.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.414
MAYBE SHE SHOULD STOP
TEACHING FOR A WHILE

19:41.514 --> 19:43.650
TO HELP TAKE CARE
OF YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.685
NO.  NO, SHE IS
FINALLY GETTING THE CHANCE
TO LIVE A LITTLE.  NO.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.388
APRIL, I RESPECT
YOUR WANTING TO
PROTECT YOUR MOTHER,

19:48.488 --> 19:50.290
BUT I THINK
AT A DEEPER LEVEL

19:50.390 --> 19:51.958
YOU'RE ALSO TRYING
TO PROTECT YOURSELF

19:52.058 --> 19:54.827
FROM SEEING
YOUR MOTHER'S
FEAR FOR YOU,

19:54.927 --> 19:57.029
FROM FEELING HOW MUCH
DANGER YOU'RE IN.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.332
YOU SAY THAT
YOU WANT TO PROTECT HER,

19:59.432 --> 20:01.468
BUT SURELY YOU KNOW
THAT IF YOU WERE TO DIE--

20:01.568 --> 20:04.937
IF YOU WERE TO DIE,
SHE WOULD NEVER--

20:05.037 --> 20:07.507
AND I KNOW THIS.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS
AS A FATHER--

20:07.607 --> 20:10.577
IF THAT HAPPENED TO ME,
I WOULD NEVER EVER RECOVER.

20:12.111 --> 20:15.181
LISTEN TO ME.
YOU HAVE TO BEGIN
CHEMO IMMEDIATELY.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.783
I THINK THE REASON
YOU HAVEN'T

20:16.883 --> 20:19.352
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
TO GO THROUGH IT ALONE.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.622
IS THERE ANYONE
YOU CAN IMAGINE
YOURSELF TELLING?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.625
ANYONE WHO YOU WOULD WANT
TO BE THERE WITH YOU?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.428
- I CAN'T.
- YOU CAN.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.530
IT'S TOO HORRIBLE.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

20:30.630 --> 20:33.400
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HER THAT
HER DAUGHTER--

20:33.500 --> 20:36.202
YOU MEAN YOU. YOU.

20:36.303 --> 20:40.206
--THAT I HAVE CANCER?

20:40.307 --> 20:42.909
NO, I CAN'T.
IT'S TOO HORRIBLE.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.944
HORRIBLE AS IT IS,

20:45.044 --> 20:47.747
NOT TELLING HER
IS MORE HORRIBLE.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.786
WHEN YOU SAY IT,
IT MAKES SENSE--

20:55.455 --> 20:57.957
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE
AND TELL HER.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.694
BUT I KNOW THAT
ONCE I LEAVE HERE,

21:01.794 --> 21:03.029
I WON'T BE ABLE TO.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.897
CALL HER
FROM HERE THEN.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.867
- NOW?
- GO AHEAD.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.939
SHE'LL JUST
BE LEAVING FOR WORK.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.062
CAN I--

21:36.162 --> 21:38.831
CAN I USE
YOUR PHONE AGAIN?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.938
OF COURSE.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.055
I PRESUME YOU WANT
THE ROOM AGAIN?

22:46.065 --> 22:48.401
( door opens )

22:50.136 --> 22:53.339
- THANK YOU.
- HOW'D IT GO?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.141
SHE WAS IN THE CAR.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.877
SHE WANTED
TO CALL ME BACK--

22:57.977 --> 23:00.780
IT'S ILLEGAL
TO TALK AND DRIVE
AT THE SAME TIME.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.517
WITH MY DAD IN THE ARMY,
SHE FOLLOWS THE LAW.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.256
YOU CAN STAY HERE
FOR 10 MINUTES

23:10.356 --> 23:12.892
- AND CALL HER BACK.
- NO, I'M SO TIRED.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.796
I'M GONNA TAKE
A NAP AND CALL HER
WHEN I GET UP.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.431
OKAY.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.933
WILL YOU CALL ME AFTER
YOU'VE SPOKEN TO HER?

23:21.033 --> 23:23.570
OKAY.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.814
( theme music playing )
