02:27.680 --> 02:30.672
- Did you make a wish?
- Yeah.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.235
No lunch. I got speech class.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.108
What do you need speech class for?
You talk fine.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.078
I'll pick you up at five,
we'll ride back together.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.596
I can't. I got Emerging Markets
seminar at 5.30.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.151
Jeez, it's your birthday. Can't they
emerge without you just this once?

03:12.240 --> 03:14.708
- What time is my surprise party?
- What?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.233
Come on.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.118
I'm supposed to have you home at seven.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.078
I'll cut out early and be home at 7.15, OK?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.799
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.354
- Morning, Tess.
- Morning.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.951
- Hi, Tess.
- Hi.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.635
Mr Turkel's line.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.951
Who's calling, please?

04:09.440 --> 04:11.192
Hold on a moment.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.271
Mr Lutz?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.668
Hold on a second, all right?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.751
Mr Turkel?

04:30.640 --> 04:33.712
Mr Alagash... Hi.

04:33.800 --> 04:38.271
- Mr Alagash is real anxious to talk to you.
- You couldn't maybe get him to hold?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.954
You got him in Dentitech -
the one I said go short on.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.793
It's fine, but he don't wanna
hear it from a secretary.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.838
- There's no paper.
- What?

04:46.920 --> 04:51.471
There is no goddamned paper
in this stall. Get me some?

04:58.440 --> 05:01.716
Thanks. You're very kind.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.914
You're short on Dentitech at 18.
He'll be right here.

05:28.480 --> 05:33.474
See Dentitech closing? 17 and 1/8? Come Monday,
I bet it's 16 and still sittin' there.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.473
- How you figure?
- They went public at 23 with one product.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.790
Plaque-removing mouthwash?

05:39.880 --> 05:42.952
You rinse, you get this glob of plaque
you gotta spit out.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.600
Maybe it'll be big, but no one ever got rich

05:45.680 --> 05:49.673
overestimating what
the American public wants to taste.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.557
Maybe.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.077
Before I run, Tess, I have
some good news and some bad news.

05:57.720 --> 06:03.192
The straight shot is they turned you down
for the entrÃ©e programme again.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.510
- Why?
- We did all we could, Tessy.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.512
You're up against
Harvard and Wharton graduates.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.149
You've got some night school,
some secretarial time on your sheet.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.312
- Christians and lions, Tess.
- That's right.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.437
- And the good news?
- Dave has a friend.

06:18.520 --> 06:23.548
Bob in Arbitrage. You're so hungry,
they're looking for hungry down there.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.791
- Really?
- Hungry's the name of the game down there.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.316
Bob's looking for an assistant
and wants to meet you for a drink.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.073
This isn't another setup?

06:34.600 --> 06:37.194
Do I look like a pimp?

06:41.240 --> 06:46.075
Bob says he's looking for hungry,
I think to myself "Tess". The rest is up to you.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.038
- Bob in Arbitrage.
- Bob Speck.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.953
Extension 256. Expecting your call.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.110
Go get 'em, Tessy.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.798
You should have told us.
Congratulations, Tessy.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.789
Thanks.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.551
Mick?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.551
Surprise.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.920
Happy birthday.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.595
You look great.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.395
Come here.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.310
You know, Mick, just once I could go for,
like, a sweater or some earrings.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.190
You know? A present that I can
actually wear outside of this apartment.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.238
So...

08:34.280 --> 08:36.714
Is this where you usually meet for drinks?

08:36.799 --> 08:40.587
This is a big week.
A super week. We are celebrating.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.639
So, Arbitrage. Talk about adrenaline, huh?

08:44.720 --> 08:48.429
What do you think is the most
important quality for a great arbitrager?

08:48.520 --> 08:52.308
- Well, we'll go through all that at the hotel.
- The hotel?

08:52.400 --> 08:57.758
The company has a suite at the Ritz Carlton.
They give it to us boys on a bonus basis.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.149
We're gonna party.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.800
I'm sorry. Allow me. I'm so sorry.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.873
- Hey, Bob. Please.
- Sorry, I just... I get a little carried away.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.995
Arbitrage has put out this "Introduction to..."
tape for the business schools.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.710
- Let's put it in. If you have any questions...
- That would be great. Thanks.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.514
It's the wrong tape. Unless of course you...

09:30.600 --> 09:34.275
Bob, you're not seriously looking
for a new assistant, are you?

09:34.360 --> 09:37.796
Not at this moment. But I'm always
on the lookout for new blood.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.030
I am hungry, but I am not that hungry.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.156
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.631
- Would you pull over here, please?
- What are you doing?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.554
Party, Bob.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.111
Hello, Tess.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.035
You're late, Tess.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.071
Yo, David.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.075
Little bitch.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.549
You gotta see this to believe it.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.073
Take it easy.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.957
Bastard.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.709
- Tess...
- I know.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.759
You don't get ahead in this world
by calling your boss a pimp.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.115
Well, he is.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.479
Been lookin' at your file here. This is the third
time in six months I've had to place you.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.155
- It wasn't my fault.
- Where have I heard that before?

11:21.240 --> 11:23.231
Ruth, I'm 30 years old.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.995
It took me five years of night school,
but I got my degree with honours.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.071
I know I could do ajob.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.711
Ask any of my bosses, even Lutz,
if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.918
You ask 'em. I don't think
they're gonna sing your praises, Tess.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.757
Here's something for you.
Transferring down from Boston.

11:46.840 --> 11:52.119
Mergers and Acquisitions.
Name of Parker. Starts Monday.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.430
- You go home and cool off.
- OK.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.750
Tess...

11:56.840 --> 12:01.914
This is the last time I can help you.
Four strikes, you're out.

12:07.880 --> 12:13.318
- Tess McGill for Katharine Parker's office.
- It's the last desk. At the end of the aisle.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.072
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker. You must be Tess.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.912
Hi.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.910
Great bunny.

13:15.680 --> 13:20.515
I don't usually have a bunny on my desk.
It was my birthday a few days ago.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.036
- No kidding. Mine's next Tuesday. How old?
- 30.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.159
Really? Well, I'll be 30 next Tuesday.
We're practically twins.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.032
- Except I'm older.
- Just barely.

13:32.120 --> 13:37.433
I've never worked for somebody who was
younger than me before. Or for a woman.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.957
Well, there's a first time for everything.
It's not going to be a problem, is it?

13:42.040 --> 13:44.156
- No.
- Good.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.678
Why don't you pour us a couple of coffees
and come on inside? I'm light, no sugar.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.154
The stock is at 38, the tender's at 56.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.871
Come in.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.076
Yeah, what do we do about that?

14:02.160 --> 14:05.436
Well, I just checked my three.
What are yours?

14:06.440 --> 14:08.829
Yeah, I have that one.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.480
I think he's in an underwater position.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.633
All right. That's our first and second call,
and then we'll see where we are.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.712
I'll count the minutes. Bye.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.597
Thanks.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.274
So, Tess, a few ground rules.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.432
The way I look at it,
you are my link with the outside world.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.875
People's impression of me starts with you.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.396
You're tough when it's warranted,
accommodating when you can be.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.075
You're accurate, punctual.
You never make a promise you can't keep.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.958
I'm never on another line, I'm in a meeting.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.350
I consider us a team,
and as such we have a uniform.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.635
Simple, elegant, impeccable.

14:45.720 --> 14:50.271
"Dress shabbily, they notice the dress.
Dress impeccably, they notice the woman."

14:50.360 --> 14:52.351
Coco Chanel.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.713
How do I look?

14:56.800 --> 15:01.032
You look terrific.
You might wanna rethink the jewellery.

15:03.040 --> 15:07.795
I want your input, Tess. I welcome your ideas
and I like to see hard work rewarded.

15:07.880 --> 15:12.032
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.395
Yes, Katharine.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.479
- And call me Katharine.
- OK.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.073
So, let's get to work, shall we?

15:23.160 --> 15:29.110
This department's profile last year was pitiful.
Our team's got its work cut out for it.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.831
OK. Thanks.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.837
Damn. I forgot my pills again.
It's the third time this month.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.354
Did you hear about that shot
they got in Europe?

15:40.440 --> 15:44.592
They're giving it to women, in their arm.
It's good for five years.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.796
Damn pills. I'm always forgetting 'em.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.633
- I thought you might like this.
- Thank you.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.118
<i>Tess, would you come in here</i>
<i>and bring a notebook?</i>

15:58.440 --> 16:00.874
They've sold the paper and printing divisions.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.873
They sell Distribution too,
we're talking real scorched earth.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.076
Come on in.

16:07.160 --> 16:10.277
Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess.

16:11.080 --> 16:15.153
I thought I'd throw a cocktail thing
to introduce myself to the department.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.358
Ginny here has some great ideas.
Will you jot them down?

16:19.440 --> 16:23.274
The caterer is called Acme Eats.
You can get the number from Information.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.555
They do the usual hors d'oeuvres.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.996
The Raging Bull has a bartender service.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.231
And the liquor store
on Broadway and Liberty delivers.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.437
- Got that, Bess?
- Tess, yeah.

16:35.520 --> 16:39.798
- If that's the way that you wanna go.
- You have another idea?

16:39.880 --> 16:44.351
Well, I was just reading in Wabout dim sum -
these little Chinese dumplings.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.876
A restaurant on Mott Street
does them for cocktail parties.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.794
- I love those little dumplings.
- It might be more fun than the usual tidbits.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.714
- I have it on my desk. I could get it.
- You read <i>W?</i>

16:55.800 --> 17:00.749
I read a lot of things. You never know
where the big ideas could come from.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.231
I guess you're right. If dumplings
can be considered a big idea.

17:05.319 --> 17:09.551
- Well, that oughta get you started...
- Ginny, thank you so much.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.074
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.195
- You'll set those up?
- Right away.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.477
Dim sum, Tess. I like it, contribution-wise.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.710
Keep it up.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.910
The chief says "We will give
you an honourable death."

17:26.000 --> 17:27.991
"But first, keke."

17:29.040 --> 17:31.600
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.109
- Dim sum?
- Yes, yes.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.478
Come on, Katharine. What do you say?

17:43.560 --> 17:48.031
Jim, the man who spends
every weekend in August glued to his desk,

17:48.120 --> 17:51.396
that man knows that I can't
just sneak out of my own party.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.869
I'll tell you what, though. You get me
in on the Southeast Air divestiture plan,

17:56.960 --> 18:01.033
I'll buy you a drink.
Bottle of Cristal, two straws.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.192
- Deal?
- Okey-dokey.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.230
- Dim sum?
- Hi.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.116
Thank you. What a slob.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.714
You were so smooth with him.
I would have...

18:13.800 --> 18:18.510
Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick,
tomorrow's senior partner.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.479
- So, how do you think the party's going?
- Pretty well, I think.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.358
Should I stop serving now?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.829
- Better make one more round.
- Right.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.754
I'd help, but we can't busy the quarterback
with passing out the Gatorade.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.115
Arnie, my hero. You've come.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.752
Yeah?

18:51.640 --> 18:54.154
I have an idea
and you said I could come to you.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.231
Shoot.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.636
Well, you know how Trask Industries has
been looking to buy into broadcasting?

19:03.720 --> 19:06.234
- The department is...
- Working on it, yeah.

19:06.320 --> 19:10.950
I've been following it myself,
and all of a sudden I thought "radio."

19:11.040 --> 19:15.192
- Trask is looking for television stations.
- So is every Tom, Dick and Harry.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.750
My idea is that they get their feet wet in radio
and build from there.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.434
It's not as glamorous
as jumping right into TV,

19:21.520 --> 19:25.308
but it's a solid place to start
and there's a lot more of them for sale.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.598
Plus it would solve Trask's problem with
the Japanese trying to take him over,

19:29.680 --> 19:33.389
because FCC forbids foreign ownership
of radio as well as TV.

19:37.160 --> 19:42.359
Interesting. You've been
following this, you say?

19:42.440 --> 19:44.078
Yeah.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.199
No chance you overheard it,
say on the elevator?

19:48.760 --> 19:51.877
- No, no way.
- Somewhere.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.030
It's my idea.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.588
Good, good.

19:58.200 --> 20:03.877
- Discuss it with anyone else?
- Nope. You think there's something there?

20:03.960 --> 20:08.078
Well, I can think it through for you.
Leave me your notes. I'll have a look-see.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.116
OK.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.159
I've been trying to get into the entrÃ©e
programme and this would be a big push.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.789
- If anything happens, you'll...
- Absolutely, Tess.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.519
Two-way street, remember?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.591
Yeah, thank you.

20:42.400 --> 20:47.076
It's just... It's so exciting.
I mean, she takes me seriously.

20:47.160 --> 20:52.109
I know you hate when I say this,
but I think it's because she's a woman.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.158
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.

20:55.240 --> 20:59.313
And it's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is exactly what I needed.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.914
I feel like I'm finally gettin' somewhere.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.630
That's great, but let's step on it
or the pizza's gonna freeze, honey.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.555
Maybe we could all go out sometime.
Dinner in the city.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.074
You would like her, I think.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.473
God. Remember when all you had to do
was a few buckles?

21:17.560 --> 21:20.120
Yeah. Those were the days.

21:20.200 --> 21:25.228
I called the inn. All they can give you
is a ground-floor single in the new wing.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.794
Did you tell them it was me?

21:28.880 --> 21:31.030
Well, I said Parker.

22:07.800 --> 22:13.033
It's this tower room with a canopy bed
and a fireplace big enough to stand in.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.715
Perfect. Everything's in place.

22:17.480 --> 22:21.758
- For what?
- The man I've been seeing for a while.

22:21.840 --> 22:26.470
I think he's it. And I think
this could be the weekend we decide.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.633
He said there was something very important
he wanted to discuss with me.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.711
I think he's gonna pop the question.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.597
- You do?
- I think so.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.878
We're in the same city now.
I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.589
I've cleared the month of June.
And I am, after all, me.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.829
What if he doesn't pop the question?

22:48.880 --> 22:51.553
I really don't think that's a variable.

22:51.640 --> 22:57.397
Tess, you don't get anywhere in this world
by waiting for what you want to come to you.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.119
You make it happen.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.351
Watch me, Tess. Learn from me.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.118
By the way, I ran your Trask radio idea
by some of our people.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.916
It seems Trask is dead set on television.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.390
But it wasn't out in left field either.
I really liked the idea.

23:17.480 --> 23:22.474
You just keep plugging and bring me
your ideas, and we'll see what we can do.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.634
- Thank you, Katharine.
- Tess...

23:28.280 --> 23:30.794
Look at me. Who makes it happen?

23:33.200 --> 23:35.316
I do.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.119
Who does?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.430
I do. I make it happen.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.229
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.556
Miss Parker's office.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.596
Hi, Katharine.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.478
- You what?
- Broke it skiing.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.554
They won't be able to move me for
two weeks, so this is what I need you to do.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.835
Water plants. OK.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.275
Cable comes on Friday.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.635
Easy with the leg, will you?

24:28.720 --> 24:30.836
Quit staring up my gown.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.471
Now, I'm staying at my parents' house
and the housekeeper is in Barbados.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.155
What a mess. You need to let in
the flower man and the cleaning lady.

24:39.240 --> 24:43.199
Sort through the mail.
The entrance code for the front door is...

24:44.320 --> 24:47.835
It's 754-3-2000.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.630
I know there's more, but I can't think of what.

24:50.720 --> 24:55.475
Go through the calendar on my desk.
There's a bunch of invitations to be RSVP'd.

24:55.560 --> 25:00.429
I know I'm asking an awful lot, Tess,
but I don't know what else to do.

25:00.520 --> 25:04.195
- I need you to take over.
- OK. Bye.

26:19.560 --> 26:23.075

28:18.040 --> 28:20.156
"Two-way street."

28:21.040 --> 28:23.110
And "You make it happen."

29:03.280 --> 29:06.317
- What? No class?
- No class.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.268
Tess, this is not what it looks like.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.318
I mean, it is what it looks like,
but I can explain.

29:13.400 --> 29:17.109
- Well, not exactly explain.
- You snake.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.469
Shit.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.558
Come on, Tess. I'm sorry, I really am.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.999
I love you. Come on.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.753
Come back and hit me.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.319
Please.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.393
Hello. Mr Trainer's office, please?

30:25.840 --> 30:29.799
Hello. Tess McGill calling from Petty Marsh.
May I put her through?

30:29.880 --> 30:31.871
Thank you.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.757
Mr Trainer?

30:36.840 --> 30:42.437
Hi, this is Tess McGill. I work with Katharine
Parker over here in Mergers and Acquisitions.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.149
I have a proposal that
I'd like to discuss with you.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.674
Not over the phone, though.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.831
I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.597
OK.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.355
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.317
Bye.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.919
Yes, I'm calling for Katharine Parker
in regard to your invitation.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.232
Miss Parker is out of town, but Miss Tess
McGill will be attending in her place.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.719
Yes. Thank you.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.554
Why does it do that?

31:44.640 --> 31:47.996
- For cleaning.
- Are you kiddin' me?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.071
No.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.509
What is this thing you're going to anyway?

31:56.600 --> 32:00.673
The closing party for the Minidyne-Dalton
merger. Dewey Stone is throwing it.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.877
That's where Trainer works.
It's the perfect time to meet him.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.589
Mix business with pleasure.
Fringe times are crucial.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.069
What'd you do, snatch her invite?

32:10.160 --> 32:12.151
Well, she can't use it.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.472
It's important for me to start interacting
with people, not as a secretary...

32:16.560 --> 32:19.120
But as a total impostor. Right.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.509
This is it.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.236
It needs some bows or somethin'.

32:29.320 --> 32:33.438
No. It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.

32:33.520 --> 32:38.036
Says to people: Confident, a risk-taker,
not afraid to be noticed.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.591
Then you hit 'em with your smarts.
Here. Shoes. I need shoes.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.871
$6,000? It's not even leather.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.071
$6,000?

32:54.720 --> 32:57.234
$6,000.

32:57.320 --> 33:01.791
- Cyn, I can't breathe so good.
- Oh, God. Come here.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.668
Sit down. Let's see
if she's got anything soothing.

33:18.440 --> 33:22.353
Valium. In the convenient economy size.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.829
- You sure?
- Just chills you ever so slightly.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.309
You won't even notice it.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.358
Are you sure about this?

33:35.440 --> 33:39.228
You wanna be taken seriously,
you need serious hair.

34:12.719 --> 34:17.235
Go for the jugular.
There are 19 million shares outstanding.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.676
We got 25% . We get another 5%,
we've got 'em by the throat.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.399
Trainer, let's grab 'em by the balls.

34:23.480 --> 34:28.838
Cut 'em off at the knees. They'll be
eating out of our hands. What do you say?

34:28.920 --> 34:31.956
- Anybody thirsty?
- We need this one, Trainer.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.032
- You need this one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:47.360 --> 34:51.319
- I've been looking for you.
- Why? Do you know me?

34:51.400 --> 34:56.235
No, but I promised myself that,
when I saw you, I would get to know you.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.952
You're the first woman here
that dresses like a woman,

35:00.040 --> 35:03.589
not like a woman thinks
a man would dress if he was a woman.

35:03.680 --> 35:07.275
- Thank you, I guess.
- What are you doing here?

35:07.360 --> 35:11.638
I'm looking for someone myself. His name
is Jack Trainer. He works at Dewey Stone.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.234
Do you know if he's here?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.550
Why are you looking for him?

35:16.640 --> 35:18.949
Well, I have a meeting with him tomorrow.

35:19.040 --> 35:23.079
I thought it might be nice
to say hello and get a head start.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.550
Well, he just left.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.670
- I should be going myself.
- Have a drink with me.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.752
I can't. What's your name?

35:38.840 --> 35:41.877
No. No names. No business cards.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.315
- No "You must know so and so".
- What is this?

35:44.400 --> 35:48.109
No rÃ©sumÃ©s. Let's just meet
like human beings for once.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.030
It's nice to meet you, whatever your name is,
but I do have to go.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.397
Please. Please. One drink.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.152
OK, one drink. But I'm buying.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.231
OK, but it's an open bar.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.198
I knew that. I meant that
if it wasn't, I would be buying.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.679
Yeah.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.355
- Tequila Gold. Doubles.
- Tequila?

36:13.640 --> 36:17.918
Yeah. I promised myself that
when we met we'd drink tequila.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.436
No Chardonnay, no frog water.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.715
Real drinks.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.198
These things are usually so boring.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.351
I wouldn't know.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.553
Power to the people.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.870
The little people.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.350
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.954
Oh boy, oh boy...

37:02.040 --> 37:05.191
- You OK?
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

37:05.280 --> 37:12.356
I took an antihistamine before,
and it just makes for a nice little buzz.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.913
I didn't know they let
bad girls into these things.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.117
- Do I look like I don't belong here?
- No.

37:21.200 --> 37:27.196
No, no. I'm sure you're a real ace
at whatever it is that you do do.

37:27.280 --> 37:31.432
- Damn straight.
- But how you look...

37:33.640 --> 37:38.156
I have a head for business and a bod for sin.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.550
Is there anything wrong with that?

37:41.640 --> 37:43.631
No... No.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.231
Hello. Hi.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.470
I have to go now.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.120
- I'll come with you.
- No.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.995
Hey, Tess.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.319
I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.475
Excuse me.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.473
Hello?

38:40.560 --> 38:42.551
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.438
Where do you live?

38:53.560 --> 38:56.074
Where do you live?

38:56.160 --> 39:01.280
Park, trees, tall building.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.396
- 166 Morton. Near Hudson.
- 166 Morton.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.394
Might be kind of a mess.

39:21.480 --> 39:26.190
The cleaning lady
keeps changing days on me.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.350
Anybody's guess.

39:28.440 --> 39:34.117
I'm just warning you cos,
if it's the day before, it could be pretty bad.

39:38.840 --> 39:43.470
I don't notice so much myself,
but some of the people I've had over have,

39:44.280 --> 39:47.033
you know, remarked on it.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.954
It's not so bad.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.193
Would you...

40:47.280 --> 40:49.919
Would you like a nightcap?

40:52.400 --> 40:54.391
I guess not.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.352
I guess it's too late for coffee.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.072
Herb tea? Herb tea?

41:05.800 --> 41:07.995
I don't have any.

41:08.080 --> 41:12.676
It always sounds good when people
offer it to me when I'm in your shape.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.032
I might have a little brandy myself.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.354
Boy...

41:23.440 --> 41:25.829
You sure are pretty.

42:58.240 --> 43:01.437
Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up.

43:09.280 --> 43:12.033
Hi. Tess McGill to see Jack Trainer.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.918
- May I take your coat?
- Yes, please.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.793
Gentlemen, Tess McGill.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.392
Miss McGill, I'm Jack Trainer.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.795
How are you?

43:42.880 --> 43:45.189
This is John Romano and Bernie Kotar.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.869
Sit down, please.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.591
- Coffee?
- Sure.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.514
- Milk or sugar?
- Both, thank you.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.353
I suppose we should just get right down to it.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.431
Sure.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.788
I've lost my briefcase.

44:13.080 --> 44:17.039
In each of the last three quarters,
Trask Industries has announced plans

44:17.120 --> 44:22.194
to acquire a major market television station,
each time unsuccessfully.

44:22.280 --> 44:26.512
At the same time they've expended time
and money fighting off a takeover attempt

44:26.600 --> 44:30.275
by one of their Japanese competitors.

44:30.360 --> 44:34.717
Buying into radio would, in one fell swoop
accomplish two important tasks.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.112
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,

44:38.200 --> 44:42.478
and, because of FCC regulations forbidding
foreign ownership of radio stations,

44:42.560 --> 44:46.553
it would wipe out the threat
of a Japanese takeover.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.320
Interesting idea.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.350
But I don't like it.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.352
Trask has got a lot of cash
on their balance sheet.

44:58.440 --> 45:03.639
That's why they're a takeover target.
A radio station is small potatoes.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.950
I can't see him biting.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.554
I've already thought of that.

45:08.640 --> 45:13.031
I figure that we look for a radio network -
one with a real high profile.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.558
And with the surplus cash,
we implement a major stock repurchase.

45:18.640 --> 45:23.236
So Trask is protected and their stock goes up,
and everybody's happy.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.911
Or not.

45:31.640 --> 45:34.279
Shoot me. Just shoot me.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.114
Would you cut that out?
They didn't throw you out, did they?

45:38.200 --> 45:44.799
Well, they don't exactly have bouncers.
They're a little more subtle than that, Cyn.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.678
Oh, God. And last night.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.913
Yeah. I should've checked the milligrams.
Live and learn.

45:53.120 --> 45:57.636
Maybe he'll feel sorry for you, and make it
up to you doing your deal or whatever it is.

45:57.720 --> 46:02.953
I'm not looking for sympathy.
You know, I had a shot at...

46:05.720 --> 46:07.676
It's him. He's here.

46:07.760 --> 46:11.389
Do me a favour. Be me. Be my secretary.

46:11.960 --> 46:14.315
- Tess.
- Cyn, please, do it for me.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.391
OK...

46:17.320 --> 46:18.309
Tess.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.871
- May I help you?
- Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.478
Let's give her a shout, shall we?

46:38.120 --> 46:40.759
You decent?

46:42.560 --> 46:45.279
A Mr Jack Trainer to see you, Miss McGill.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.634
Thank you, Cynthia.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.712
- Hold all calls, Miss McGill?
- Yes, Cynthia. Thank you.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.429
Can I get you anything, Mr Trainer?
Coffee? Tea? Me?

46:54.760 --> 46:58.719
Isn't she a riot? That'll be all, Cynthia.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.110
Why did you say you weren't you last night?

47:02.200 --> 47:06.352
Because I knew what would happen.
All mergers and acquisitions.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.557
No lust and tequila.

47:10.960 --> 47:16.592
That was... That just happened, OK?
I wanna make it clear...

47:18.160 --> 47:20.913
What did happen exactly?

47:21.000 --> 47:24.037
The earth moved. The angels wept.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.434
The Polaroids are...

47:28.240 --> 47:30.595
are in my other coat.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.279
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

47:35.360 --> 47:38.238
I woke up in my underwear.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.834
I'll bet you looked nice.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.879
Did you get me that way?

47:45.640 --> 47:49.679
I... I took off your shoes and dress,
I put you on the bed.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.877
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.155
And that was it?

47:55.240 --> 47:58.198
I might have peeked. I don't remember.

47:58.280 --> 48:01.875
Look, I don't have all day to hang out here
and discuss your sex life.

48:01.960 --> 48:04.349
Here.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.079
- What's this?
- Open it.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.476
What's this for?

48:19.560 --> 48:24.953
I thought you could use a better briefcase
if we're gonna put this deal together.

48:25.040 --> 48:28.316
- You liked it.
- It has possibilities.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.231
I wanna go to Metro Radio Systems.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.471
They're a family-owned,
mid-sized network in the South.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.154
They had offers before and rejected 'em, but

48:37.240 --> 48:40.710
the father's about to retire,
and the son's just been forced out.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.837
A lot of squabbling. A good time to go in.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.275
OK.

48:45.520 --> 48:49.274
Why didn't you just put it together
with your people here? Why come to us?

48:51.600 --> 48:54.478
Will you excuse me for one second?

48:54.560 --> 48:56.551
Sure.

48:58.280 --> 49:00.350
You're not helping. No.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.796
Bess, my computer's down.
I need Katharine's office right away.

49:03.880 --> 49:06.440
No problem. I'll be with you in five minutes.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.712
- I need it five minutes ago.
- I'll be right with you.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.792
- What's going on in there?
- She's dusting.

49:13.120 --> 49:19.229
Jack, listen. My one o'clock is getting a little
antsy, so can I walk you to the elevator?

49:19.320 --> 49:22.073
Sure, but first answer my question.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.075
Right.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.720
I came to you because

49:28.480 --> 49:31.916
I wanted an ace on this. The best.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.390
Good thinking.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.553
Well, I'll fly down to Memphis
in the morning and feel them out.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.034
Absolutely. Fine.

49:47.480 --> 49:51.917
...you'll just have to wait.
- Ginny, go on in. I'll be with you in a minute.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.275
What are you talking about?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.117
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?

50:02.200 --> 50:05.670
- Are you free for dinner tonight?
- No, sorry.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.871
How about tomorrow?

50:08.960 --> 50:11.918
- I can't.
- When, then?

50:12.000 --> 50:15.515
I don't think we should
get involved that way.

50:15.600 --> 50:18.398
What are you talking about?
What about last night?

50:18.480 --> 50:22.109
Look, I'm not that girl.
Last night was special.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.749
It wasn't so special. I had to
carry you up three flights of stairs.

50:25.840 --> 50:28.274
I meant unusual special.

50:28.360 --> 50:31.591
Look, we're in a business deal
together now,

50:31.680 --> 50:34.558
and I don't think we should
get involved that way.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.995
My life is real complicated as it is.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.868
I don't wanna complicate it either.
I just thought dinner, a movie.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.919
- We both know what we're talking about.
- I certainly hope so.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.798
You know, maybe I just don't like you.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.111
Me? Nah.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.953
- You sure she's gonna show?
- It's my engagement party.

51:18.040 --> 51:21.157
She knows she's dead meat if she doesn't.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.671
Hi, Tess.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.269
I'm real sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

51:33.360 --> 51:36.796
You're gonna be outta work,
you keep scamming like you are.

51:36.880 --> 51:41.510
Look, I'm nervous as hell and I think Mick's
about to drown himself in a Scotch bottle.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.114
- He's bad, huh?
- Throw him a bone, will ya?

51:44.200 --> 51:47.192
I want happy humans here tonight.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.477
Tess.

52:03.560 --> 52:05.551
Snake.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.078
You look different.

52:11.160 --> 52:14.994
I'm not the same pathetic, trusting fool
that I was a couple of days ago.

52:15.080 --> 52:17.913
- It shows, huh?
- Hey, Tess. What are you havin'?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.639
Stow this behind the bar for me,
will you, Tony?

52:20.720 --> 52:24.235
And I'll have a Chivas,
and buy Mick one of whatever.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.311
You got it.

52:27.680 --> 52:31.878
No, I just meant the hair, the duds,
and the briefcase. What's goin' on?

52:31.960 --> 52:35.396
- Make fun if you want.
- No, no. You look good.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.351
Classy.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.515
Did you have to go
to traffic court or somethin'?

52:42.600 --> 52:46.229
No, I just got off work.
I sort of got a promotion.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.912
Well...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.833
To Cyn and Tim.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.115
To you and me.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.316
To you and your promotion.

52:57.400 --> 53:01.188
- To me getting a boat loan.
- You what? You did?

53:01.280 --> 53:05.910
It was approved this morning. Put a
down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.195
That's so great.

53:57.520 --> 54:01.832
"Hours of fun for the entire family.
Love, Tess and Mick."

54:01.920 --> 54:02.955
Thank you.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.479
I put from both of us. I didn't know
if you'd gotten something or what.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.438
OK, toast. We need a toast.

54:13.880 --> 54:14.869
Thank you. Thank you.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.554
From me and Tess and everybody here,

54:17.640 --> 54:22.839
may your life together be long and happy,
and may the road always rise up to meet you.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.110
When are we gonna toast
the two of you, Mick?

54:31.720 --> 54:35.395
- We haven't really discussed it. Not recently.
- No.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.233
You don't discuss it, boy. You just ask.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.998
Here?

54:41.480 --> 54:44.597
- Now?
- On your knees, man.

54:45.960 --> 54:49.748
Mick.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.395
Tess, will you marry me?

55:07.400 --> 55:09.391
Maybe.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.989
That's an answer?

55:13.720 --> 55:17.269
You want another answer, ask another girl.

55:31.560 --> 55:35.758
- You fuckin' humiliated us in there.
- You set us up, doing it like that.

55:35.840 --> 55:39.594
What did you expect me to do?
Lie in front of all of those people?

55:39.680 --> 55:42.592
Didn't know you'd have to lie.
I thought you'd want me to ask.

55:42.680 --> 55:45.353
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.

55:45.440 --> 55:49.399
We have a drink, a dance, and boom -
you want an answer about the rest of my life.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.072
All right. OK.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.197
Here we are, just the two of us.
Will you marry me or what?

55:54.280 --> 55:56.794
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide this right now?

55:56.880 --> 55:59.633
I want to get things solidified.
Things in my life.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.393
You're not the only one
who's got plans, you know.

56:02.480 --> 56:04.550
- I said maybe.
- Maybe means dick.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.756
Fuck maybe. I want an answer now.

56:06.960 --> 56:10.157
Please don't yell at me.
You treat me like I'm...

56:10.240 --> 56:12.595
Why do we always talk about
how you get treated?

56:12.680 --> 56:15.990
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?

56:16.080 --> 56:19.595
I am not steak. You can't just order me.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.877
You get your priorities straight,
maybe we'll talk.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.394
Right now, we're history.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.033
Katharine Parker's office.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.796
I'll switch you over.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.076
Tess, it's me.

57:05.760 --> 57:08.479
I couldn't find the red shoes...

57:10.400 --> 57:13.551
Tess McGill's office. Who's calling?

57:14.200 --> 57:16.395
One moment, please.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.749
Jack.

57:19.840 --> 57:22.559
It went well in Memphis. Yeah...

57:22.640 --> 57:26.679
Really well, I think. But we're gonna
have to move fast and hit 'em high.

57:26.760 --> 57:31.595
Armbrister thinks that Metro is family,
and you know how that can be.

57:31.680 --> 57:36.356
He's willing to listen,
but you gotta get Trask to talk sweet.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.000
He's thinking about 70 mil.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.277
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.

57:42.360 --> 57:45.113
I'd like to go over it with you.
Can we meet for lunch?

57:45.200 --> 57:48.875
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, a lot of people around.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.715
There's that real romantic souvlaki stand,
out in front of your place.

57:53.800 --> 57:56.598
You're in no particular danger, I think.

58:00.760 --> 58:02.955
Yeah. Meet you there around one.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.033
OK, I'll see you then. Bye.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.992
Mick's really raw.

58:11.080 --> 58:14.755
He says he's gonna throw
the rest of your stuff out.

58:15.640 --> 58:19.030
He kept me there talkin' at me
till five this morning.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.509
Oh, God, Cyn. I'm sorry.

58:23.960 --> 58:27.589
- How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
- What are you talkin' about?

58:27.680 --> 58:32.310
Oren Trask's daughter is getting married
tomorrow. The reception is at the Union Club.

58:32.400 --> 58:35.790
So I figure I blend in. I get to Trask.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.553
I mean, how hard could that be?

58:38.640 --> 58:42.428
The wedding party's not gonna admit
that they've never seen you before.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.636
Nobody knows everybody at those things.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.439
- Tess...
- All I need is five minutes with Trask.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.954
Tess, I'm talkin' to you.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.712
What?

58:51.800 --> 58:53.836
First of all, look me in the eye

58:53.920 --> 58:57.469
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,

58:57.560 --> 59:02.714
Mr Briefcase "Let's have lunch" there
is gonna take you away from all of this.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.314
We're doing a deal together, that's all.

59:05.400 --> 59:09.518
Cos you know you'll get your heart stomped,
just like you're stompin' Mick's.

59:09.600 --> 59:13.718
Hey, it wasn't me poppin'
Doreen DiMucci in our bed, OK?

59:13.800 --> 59:17.475
- How come you're all on his side?
- I'm not.

59:17.560 --> 59:22.793
But you're not even giving him the chance
to make it up to you, and that's not like you.

59:22.880 --> 59:28.079
Look, if you're so smart, why don't you act
smart and save your ass while you still can?

59:28.160 --> 59:32.392
Else they're gonna find out,
you're not gonna have yourjob, or any job.

59:32.480 --> 59:34.471
You lost your man and your home already.

59:34.560 --> 59:39.793
I'm gonna come clean as soon as
I get my end set up. I swear.

59:39.880 --> 59:43.031
- I know what I'm doing.
- So do I. Screwin' up your life.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.236
No, I'm trying to make it better.

59:45.320 --> 59:49.108
I'm not gonna spend my life
working my ass off and getting nowhere

59:49.200 --> 59:53.637
just because I followed rules that
I had nothing to do with setting up, OK?

59:57.320 --> 59:59.390
Tess McGill's office.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.516
Katharine... No.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.068
Of course it's still your office. I was just...

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.549
I'll see you, Tess.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.271
Cyn.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.389
Sometimes I sing and dance
around the house in my underwear.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.756
Doesn't make me Madonna. Never will.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.431
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes, Katharine.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.719
Don't get too used to those long lunches.
I'm coming back a week from today.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.031
A week from today?
Isn't that faster than you thought?

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.873
Well, the doctor says I've got great bones.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.873
Of course, his aren't too bad either.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.430
Anyway, I need you to summarise
the Baron Oil prospectus...

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.873
Hi, <i>Schatz.</i>

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.873
And send that to me along with
the last two quarterly reports.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.191
- You are a sport.
- Yes, I'm a sport.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.029
OK. Bye.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.352
So what kind of figures
have you been throwing at 'em?

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.715
Well, no exact figures yet.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.155
What's their ballpark?

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.030
I want to get them excited about the concept
before I start throwing actual figures at them.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.476
- Are they excited?
- They're going to be.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.792
Wait a minute.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.872
I've been working on this thing
for 36 hours straight.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.839
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2 o'clock.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.356
- Where the hell exactly are we?
- Don't yell at me.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.874
Answer me.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.839
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna see
Trask himself tomorrow.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.832
I feel that we're strong enough
to go right to him.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.673
Where are we meeting him? What time?

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.354
He's not expecting both of us.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.480
Are you trying to fly this thing without me?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.111
- No. I wouldn't do that.
- You go and set up this meeting without me.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.476
What the hell kind of a way
to do business is this?

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.109
- Would you calm down?
- How am I supposed to calm down?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.078
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned these days.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.199
The line buttons on my phone all have
an inch of little pieces of tape piled on.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.430
The names of new guys over old guys.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.913
Good men who aren't at the other end of
the line any more, all cos of one lost deal.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.031
I don't wanna get buried
under a little piece of tape.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.588
No one's trying to do that.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.240
OK, so I've been in a little bit of a slump.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.472
I'm not afraid to admit it. Give me
a break here. Don't go leading me on.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.916
If you got doubts about me,
say 'em to my face. Give me that much.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.275
I don't have any doubts about you.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.071
OK.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.036
You need me, you know.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.193
- I mean any doubts about your ability.
- You need me at that meeting.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.720
Is he jet-lagged, or he just lunches late?

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.038
Three o'clock's a late lunch.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.908
Well, it's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food there.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.596
- What's the story, Tess?
- It's his daughter's wedding.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.035
- That's the meeting?
- It's perfect.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.033
He's happy, he's had a little champagne.
We look for an opening. Trust me.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.953
What are we supposed to do?
Jump out of the wedding cake?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.429
Don't be silly.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.231
Welcome to our party. Come in.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.870
Hello. Nice to see you.
Do you know which table you're at?

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.909
- No...
- Yes. I do, darling.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.869
I see Phyllis. Come on.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.238
Glad you could make it.
Oren and Barbara Trask.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.274
- Tess McGill. What a great idea.
- Jack Trainer.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.319
- It's so nice to see you again.
- Well, the kids thought it would be fun.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.359
- You must be friends of Mark's.
- Well, let's get you over there.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.991
Actually, I should go powder my bathroom...
nose. Darling, will you wait here?

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.753
It's so nice... See you later.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.474
I think I'll get a drink.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.356
Bunny.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.310
Isn't he gorgeous?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.034
Get a grip. Get a grip, Tess. Get a grip.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.958
We're not even invited to this thing, are we?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.636
OK, so we're not exactly invited. But he's here
and we're here. So that makes us...

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.269
- Total idiots.
...in the right place at the right time.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.590
You're like one of those crazed cops.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.310
The kind nobody wants to ride with,
whose partners all end up dead or crazy.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.155
Just act like you belong.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.670
Do you love it or do you hate it?

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.754
- Love it.
- So do I.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.391
But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and
that we're making some kind of statement.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.438
Oh, no. It's just like paradise.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.231
It's like a paradise with little gold palm trees.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.229
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.875
I hope I'm not being rude, but who are you?

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.636
I'm Tess. I'm... I'm a friend of Mark's.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.908
I'm just so happy that
I could be here for you today.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.235
Glorious. Fabulous. Stunning, really.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.154
Super. Elegant. Perfect.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.513
You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.394
Excuse me.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.438
The woman that's dancing with Oren -
what's her name?

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.353
- Elizabeth Stubblefield?
- That's right.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.477
- Liz? Beth?
- Bitsy.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.551
Bitsy. That's right.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.832
Jack...

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.309
You wanna do it, do it.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.670
Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart
and tell me you don't remember me.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.472
- Of course I do.
- Excuse us.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.029
Talk about a small world, huh?

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.399
I mean, here we've just met and yet I feel
I've spent so much time working with you.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.711
In a way. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty Marsh.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.273
I really wish we were having more luck
with your team.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.794
So do I. So do I.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.678
I've been trying to set you up
with a radio network,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.833
but my bosses think you're stuck on
acquiring television and won't listen.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.878
- Well, that's not true.
- That's what I said.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.952
I said that the man who in 1971
looked into the future

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.838
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:54.119
the man who applied Japanese management
ideas while others kowtowed to the unions,

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.670
the man who saw the Ma Bell break-up
coming from miles away,

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.514
this man did not get to be
this man - you, I mean -

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.957
by shutting himself off to new ideas.
Am I right or am I right?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.634
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight I'm right.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.836
If you have a property, I'd love to hear.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.036
- You would?
- Well, absolutely.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.111
- What looks good now?
- There she is.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.479
I just realised that I...
I'm hogging the father of the bride.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.712
And I see Phyllis coming... What do you say
that I give you a call on Monday?

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.270
- Our media consultant is Tim Draper.
- Tim. Right.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.033
- Honey, I'm starved.
- So am I.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.236
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:39.194
Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet
with his people first thing Monday.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.908
Oren Trask? The man who said "What if
we sliced the bread before we sold it?"

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.433
All right...

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.718
No, no, no. I loved it.
I had fun. And you were amazing.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:51.828
- You think so?
- Amazing.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.229
The Fort Worth station - projected revenues
should read up 8%, not 6% .

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.711
And where it says the FCC ruling on
Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending,

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.951
that's outdated. FCC approved it Friday.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.149
Doubles the signal reach.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.109
Ups the station's value by 30%.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.589
And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.389
I guess we're ready.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:50.397
- Trainer and McGill.
- Yes. Top of the stairs.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.189
Are we waiting for Mr Trask?

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.999
Mr Trask doesn't sit in at this level.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.673
Of course he doesn't.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:19.470
Here's the way we see it. Trask Industries
has two important needs to meet at this time.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.554
By acquiring Metro Radio Network,
you nail two birds with one stone...

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.633
Excuse me. Do you have any
other proposals besides Metro?

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.678
- No. Why?
- Metro's a terrific opportunity.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.239
I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group
just put a bear hug on Metro this morning

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.993
and the company's in play.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.594
- Just this morning?
- Who?

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.275
The Slade brothers.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.351
Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.149
We certainly don't want
to get into a bidding war.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.515
A moment, please.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.276
Armbrister looks at Metro as if it were part
of his family. He cares who he's selling to.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.352
Yes. And he holds the majority of the stock.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.111
Look. If the Slades are uninvited,
and I'm sure they are,

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.830
and Armbrister and Trask can agree
on a deal, then we won't have a war.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.071
If I get Armbrister up here,
will Trask take the meeting?

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.993
A lot of ifs. We really
don't want to get involved.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.636
- 24 hours.
- Sorry. Not interested.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.955
Yes, sir.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.395
All right, sir.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.320
Yes, he'll take the meeting.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.118
- That was Mr Trask?
- Yes, it was.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.038
How did he know?

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.031
He knows everything.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.911
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.549
How'd you get this scar?

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.035
Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.151
Really?

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.711
No. No.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.273
I was 19 and I thought
it'd be cool to have a pierced ear.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.150
My girlfriend stuck the needle through
and I fainted and hit my chin on the toilet.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.434
Have you been telling that story ever since?

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.956
You're the only one
who knows the true story.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.749
Except the girlfriend.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.119
I had her disappear.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.717
It's too bad. Nice girl. Real shame.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.555
Jack, there's something that I have to tell you.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.751
Hello.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.431
Hi.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.830
I know. No...

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.229
Can't wait.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.754
Yeah, OK. Well, call me when you get in.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.711
OK.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.836
Me too.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.115
OK. Bye.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.671
Bye.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.959
OK... There's this woman.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.315
It's over.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.190
But technically it's not. I just haven't
had a chance to break it off yet.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.919
It's OK. You don't have to explain.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.551
No, really. We were supposed to go away
together a couple of weeks ago

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.676
and I was gonna tell her then.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.558
But I had to work through the weekend
and never got there.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.235
It's just a... a timing thing.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.319
It's just she broke her leg skiing
and was laid up

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.712
and I couldn't see doing it
over the phone, you know.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.519
Kicking somebody when they're down.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.029
I wouldn't mention it, except
she's in your department at Petty.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.352
- You mentioned her the first time you called.
- Katharine.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.915
Parker. Yeah.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.874
Now what did you wanna tell me?

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.791
It's not important.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.271
120, even.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.960
Miss. Miss, you forget your book.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.749
Tess. It's me. I'm back.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.231
Thanks.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.556
She took a muscle relaxant for the flight.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.279
- Let's all have one.
- I don't think so.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.316
Telephone. I need a telephone.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.312
Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.911
I love these pills.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.198
Just for a minute, Jack. Please?

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.111
I must see you, darling.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.195
My apartment in one hour
and I won't take no for an answer.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.555
No, I won't take no for an answer.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.274
Oh, I'm home. I'm home, I'm home.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.591
Oh, God...

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.474
- Did you happen to see this?
- What is it?

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.189
It's an outline of your idea
for a Trask radio acquisition.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.434
I was planning to send it over to Jack Trainer.
I thought I'd give your idea one last go-round.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.230
It just occurs to me, looking at it,
that it reads as though it were my idea.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.314
Jack got burned once. He was accused of
stealing a plan for taking a company private.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.552
He's very sticky about the ethics of
reviewing other people's strategies.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.634
He wouldn't do it if it was from a colleague,
and I couldn't say it was a secretary's notion.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.872
Anyway, the point is, Tess,
that I'm still trying to get you heard.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.955
What am I saying? If you had seen it,
you simply would have asked me about it.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.875
Trust.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.754
I'll need help bathing and changing.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.273
I need something to cover this cast.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.075
There's an afghan on the chair.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.673
- Perfect.
- If that'll be all...

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.878
And some perfume.
Shalimar, on the dresser.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.509
He loves Shalimar.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.235
- He, who?
- Jack Trainer, who.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.591
He's on his way over.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.274
I have to go. Doctor's appointment.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.955
One last thing? Run down
to the drugstore and get me my pills?

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.350
- I really have to go.
- The doctor will understand.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.951
Thanks.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.349
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- Jack.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.189
- Katharine?
- In the bedroom.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.959
Jack.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.031
Katharine.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.469
Boy, did I ever miss you.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.310
- Does it hurt?
- Look at you.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.552
- You said it was urgent, Kath.
- I'd forgotten how handsome you are.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.475
Thanks. Look...

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.835
I meant what I said. I really am swamped...

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.390
Boy, some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.792
There's some champagne in
the little fridge. You wanna get it for us?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.555
Sure. And then, I really do have to go.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.832
- Where are the glasses?
- Try the dishwasher.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.389
Here you are.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.193
You know I love you, Jack. You know that.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.792
I have to get going.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.000
These past few weeks, I've heard this
funny little sound, way deep down inside.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.433
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.392
- My biological clock.
- Big deal going. Principals are all meeting...

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.029
And I've been thinking "Let's merge."

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.391
You and I.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.155
Think of it, darling.
Mr and Mrs Fabulously Happy.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.509
Katharine, it's really not a good time to talk.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.631
You're right.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.708
Can Big Jack come out to play?

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:07.032
- Little Jack really has to get going.
- Little Katie's been so lonely...

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.429
No. No. No.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.511
Jack. What is it?

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.395
There's something I have to tell you.
There's someone else and I...

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.869
There's someone else?

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:23.070
Someone else that I have to be meeting
right now. Big deal going.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.913
Can't be in two places at the same time.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.275
Talk to you later. Bye.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.311
Here we are.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.200
OK, I've gotta run. Sorry. Bye.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.511
Tess, you forgot your notebook.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.679
That little slut.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.352
Goddamn little bitch secretary.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.556
Hi. I have a meeting with Mr Trask.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.631
- Your name, please?
- Tess McGill.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.154
All right. It's at the top of the stairs.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.239
Miss McGill.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.709
Good afternoon. Let me take your coat.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.829
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.191
Thank you.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.874
- Hi.
- Hi. Is everything OK?

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.397
Yeah, yeah. You're the only one
from Petty here so far. What's going on?

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.313
- Flying solo on this.
- Good.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.074
Old Armbrister and Trask are over there.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.357
We're waiting to see what colour smoke
comes out of the chimney.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.752
Tell me something. If a colleague of mine
had a strategy they needed help with,

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.435
- would you look at it if I asked you to?
- Yeah, sure.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.071
No ethics problem? You know,
open to accusations about stealing?

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.516
I look at stuff all the time.
Nobody's ever accused me of stealing.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.114
What's it about?

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.551
I don't know. I'm so nervous,
I can't stand still.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.069
You'll be fine.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.749
I love you.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.190
I love you too.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.514
Gentlemen?

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.998
There was a story on the news last night

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.356
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.718
A truck got stuck at the entrance to the
Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:48.477
For hours, the experts tried to find some way
to unwedge the vehicle, but to no avail.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.750
Finally, a 10-year-old girl in a passing car

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:57.391
suggested simply letting
the air out of the truck's tyres,

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.598
thus lowering it to the clearance level,
which they did.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.069
And it worked.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.195
Well, by letting some of the air out of
our strategy to expand into broadcasting,

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.434
Miss McGill and Mr Trainer have effectively
shown all of us here at Trask

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.114
the light at the end of our tunnel.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.430
Gentlemen and ladies.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.755
I've decided to sell Mr Trask
the Metro Radio System

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.469
for $68.5 million in cash and securities.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.632
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.236
As to what constitutes principles
in this day and age,

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.472
I'm gonna leave that
up to you barracudas to squabble over.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.120
I'm certain they'll want to hear this.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.433
Miss, this is a closed meeting and you can't...

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.999
Thank God I'm here.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.277
- What the hell is going on?
- You're being tricked.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.319
- Katharine, what...
- Jack, just trust me and sit down.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.631
I'm Katharine Parker. I'm an associate partner
in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty Marsh.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.314
And this woman is my secretary.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.996
- She's not.
- Oh, no? Ask her.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.239
- You're not her secretary.
- I can explain, Jack.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.029
Oh, Jesus. You are her secretary.

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.630
While I was laid up with broken bones,

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:29.032
she rifled through my desk, found my memo
outlining a Trask radio acquisition

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.395
and has been passing it off as her idea.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.439
It was my idea. She stole it from me, I swear.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.671
Good God, Tess.
Don't you know when to stop?

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.274
But you're lying.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.471
Thank you.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.510
Thank you.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.511
Thank you all so much.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.312
The upside is that I have found out
in time to control the damage.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.075
We have containment
and we have a deal on the table.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:17.029
I say pass me a set of papers
and let's get on with it.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.074
Who's running this thing?

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.355
Just a second, please.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.275
I know you don't believe me, but...

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.553
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.118
I'm sorry.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.550
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.551
Well, gentlemen.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.353
The players may have changed,
but the game is the same.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.238
The name of the game is "Let's make a deal".

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:15.871
If you turn to page 22 in your prospectus,
I'll take you through the terms of transferral.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.314
Well, they did it.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.789
Yeah. They sure did.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.389
You really look great.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.278
- How are you?
- Good, good.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:58.358
- Business is great and...
- Mick, did you see me?

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.829
I caught it one-handed.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.753
- Hi.
- Hey, Doreen.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:12.797
And my boat's booked through three weeks
from now. Doreen's workin' the lines for me.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.235
That's great. Really.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.349
So how's life in the fast lane?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.560
Well, it's fast.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.555
It's real fast and busy and...

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.515
It's good to see you, Mick.
I guess I'd better get.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.954
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.230
Cyn told us about what happened.
It really bites the big one, Tess. Really.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.753
- We took up a little collection.
- Thanks.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.392
It's not much. Just enough to go out and get
toasted some night when you really need it.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:32.074
Don't say no. We really wanted to.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.754
And no paying the Con Ed with it.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.871
OK. Thanks.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.994
So what are you gonna do now, huh?

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.153
You know... Play some golf,
redecorate the country house.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:51.790
I don't know. Start all over.
Find ajob, a place to live.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.992
And just wise up and not take
the whole thing so seriously.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.071
I'll be OK.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.190
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.271
- Thank you.
- Miss you.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.755
- Good luck.
- Bye, Tess.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.035
- Don't work too hard.
- Bye, Tess.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.911
Sorry.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.114
- I've been trying to find you.
- Just leave me alone.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.990
Just one thing. Was you and me
just part of the scheme too?

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.628
No.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.759
If I'd told you I was just some secretary,
you never would've taken the meeting.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.193
Think about it.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.159
Maybe you'd have fed me a few drinks and
tried to get me into the sack. End of story.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.708
- That's not true.
- Are you sure about that?

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.635
Can you honestly tell me it wouldn't have
made a difference? Who's fooling who here?

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.473
What's this? More stolen files?

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.390
No, it's my stuff from the desk.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.393
- Your stuff? Now there's a broad term.
- No, it's my stuff.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.358
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.558
but do not ever speak to me again
like we don't know what really happened.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.350
Tess, this is business.
Let's just bury the hatchet, OK?

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.271
You know where you can bury your hatchet?
Now get your bony ass out of my sight.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.480
And if you really think that I said I loved you
as part of some scheme, then that is pathetic.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.394
- My God. She'll stop at nothing.
- What kind of show are you people running?

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.519
Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.435
Jack, let's get upstairs.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.550
- Not without her.
- Jack.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.279
Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal?

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.992
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.993
Tess put this deal together.
We shouldn't proceed without her.

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.471
And you shouldn't go letting yourjohnson
make business decisions for you.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.518
I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.195
- What brings you to that conclusion?
- She said so and I believe her.

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.068
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Now, are you with us or not?

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.069
No.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.789
Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.557
- Sorry, Katharine.
- You will be sorry, Jack.

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.513
Ask her to tell you about
the hole in your deal.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.433
- What hole?
- She's playing games. Let's get going.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.909
- Fine. Go.
- No. What hole?

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.111
Look.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.309
The People Page? Now, this is ridiculous.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.517
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house-hunting."

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.149
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot
DJ hubby Slim Slicker

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.198
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."

01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.478
- So?
- Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.758
Syndicated to all their stations.
The cornerstone of their programming.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.912
Lose him and Metro's just
real estate with falling ratings.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.195
And you're not buying it for a write-off.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.589
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.831
Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs. Shall we?

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.797
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.077
Hear the lady out, sir.
There's another elevator.

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.271
You're on.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.239
OK.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:42.111
This is <i>Forbes.</i> It's the basic article about how
you were looking to get into broadcasting.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.228
OK, the same day, I'm reading the <i>Post</i>
and there's this item on Bobby Stein,

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.711
the radio guy who does those gross jokes
about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.271
Anyway, he's hosting this charity auction -
real blue bloods, and won't that be funny?

01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.273
Now I turn the page to the society stuff
and there's a picture of your daughter.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.830
Nice picture. And she's helping
to organise the charity ball.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.072
So I started to think Trask, radio. Trask, radio.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.269
And then I hooked up with Jack,
and he came on board with Metro,

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.511
and... and so now here we are.

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.317
Oren, we really don't have
any more time for fairy tales.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:34.551
Miss Parker, let me ask you a question.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.428
How did you come up the idea
for Trask to buy up Metro?

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.715
How did I?

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.233
Well, let's see. The...

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:48.756
The impulse. What led you
to put the two together?

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:55.077
Well, I would have to check my files.
I can't recall exactly the...

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.470
Generally. It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.674
You know, it would have to be the...

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.079
Jack, help me out here.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.915
Oren, I beg your pardon,
but if you are insinuating...

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.393
Miss Parker, if I were you, I'd go to your office
and take a long last look around.

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.233
Because in about five minutes, I'm going
to see to it that you get the boot but good.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.350
Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding.
I... You cannot...

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.556
I can and I will.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.313
Now get your... What did you call it?

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.554
- Bony ass.
- Right.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.313
...bony ass out of my sight.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:47.998
I'm sorry, but I simply
won't stand for that kind of talk.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.395
Will you excuse me, please?

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.713
Why didn't you tell us all this
in the boardroom that day?

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.394
No one was gonna listen, sir. Not to me.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.315
You can bend the rules upstairs,
but not while you're trying to get there.

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.915
And someone like me
can't get there without bending the rules.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.552
You've got a real fire in your belly. Or was
this just a one-time stunt that you pulled?

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.633
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.437
Are you willing to go out on that limb
every day, working for me?

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.954
- Legitimately?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.510
- Have to be at the entry level. Any problem?
- No, sir.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.312
- Gumption, Miss McGill.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.436
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.277
Trainer, Dwayne. Let's go to my office
and see about Slim whatshisname's contract.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.749
Be right with you, sir.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.152
- Way to go, Tess. Way to go.
- Beauty.

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:25.274
For you. You like it?

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.435
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Milk money.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.435
Twinkies.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.193
Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:45.916
Remember. Play nice with the other kids
and make sure you're home before dark.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.234
Hi. Tess McGill.

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.276
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:07.150
The director is out sick today, so she'll
want to see you first thing tomorrow.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.313
Miss Baxter's already up there.
She'll show you the layout.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.429
- It's all the way at the end of the hall.
- All right. Thank you.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.511
You're welcome.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.079
Anybody'll be an improvement
over that terrorist.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.958
I mean, something semi-human.

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.828
I didn't hear you come in.

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.195
- I'm Alice Baxter.
- Tess McGill.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.594
I was just using the phone.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.749
Yes, well, that happens.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.792
- How about some coffee?
- Sure. Just tell me where.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.792
No, I'll get it. How?

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.390
Milk and sugar, please.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.471
Thank you.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.871
- Miss McGill.
- Yes?

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.393
That's your desk, in there.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.310
I don't think so.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.789
Oh, yes. I sit out here.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.197
I'm sorry. I thought
the secretary would sit out here.

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.874
That's right. I'm the secretary.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.028
If it's OK, I prefer "assistant".

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.355
You've got a 10 o'clock meeting
with Slater from Development - here.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.479
11 o'clock with Donohue
from Logistics - his office on 23.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.189
And lunch with Mr Trask -
his office downtown, one o'clock.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.751
It's all right there on the computer.
Just hit shift-S for your schedule.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:33.189
When I saw you in here
on the phone with your feet up,

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.149
I figured this was your office.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:41.639
I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill.
It won't happen again ever.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.438
It's OK.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.519
Maybe now would be a good time
to go over what you expect of me.

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.278
I... I expect you to call me Tess.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.193
I don't expect you to fetch me coffee
unless you're getting some for yourself.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.150
And the rest we'll just make up
as we go along.

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.191
OK?

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.391
OK.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.799
- I'll be right outside if you need anything.
- Fine.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.432
Cyn.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.715
Guess where I am?

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.515
