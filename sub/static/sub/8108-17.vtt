00:12.597 --> 00:14.557
Am I going to have
to give a speech?

00:15.183 --> 00:16.226
You're the publisher,
can't you do it?

00:16.351 --> 00:18.019
I can warm them up,

00:18.144 --> 00:20.689
but you're gonna have to get over
this fear of public speaking

00:20.814 --> 00:23.149
before the book tour.

00:23.566 --> 00:27.195
Everybody! Can I have
your attention? Thank you.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.531
Tim has a few words to say.

00:29.656 --> 00:31.991
There you go, Tim.
They're warmed up.

00:32.117 --> 00:33.493
(PEOPLE CHUCKLE)

00:33.952 --> 00:35.286
(SIGHS) Well.

00:36.329 --> 00:38.790
What do you say
at a time like this?

00:39.082 --> 00:41.084
Seriously,
what do you say?

00:41.209 --> 00:43.962
You could thank
people for coming.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.797
Thank you, Nick.

00:45.922 --> 00:48.133
Actually, I'm always
thanking Nick.

00:48.258 --> 00:51.302
A man famous not only for
his ruthless editor's pen,

00:51.428 --> 00:54.806
but his patient handholding
of crazy authors.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.307
You'd think that
after three novels,

00:56.433 --> 00:59.144
I'd start to develop
a little confidence, but...

00:59.269 --> 01:02.313
For a book like this,
we are happy to supply the confidence.

01:02.439 --> 01:03.690
Bestseller.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.316
(ALL AGREEING)

01:05.442 --> 01:07.026
Well, that's not
going to happen.

01:07.152 --> 01:08.111
What?

01:08.236 --> 01:10.196
Come on. Short stories
don't make money.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.240
Short stories weren't making
money back in 1908.

01:12.365 --> 01:13.825
You'd have to be
mathematically illiterate

01:13.950 --> 01:15.201
to think they'd do
as well as a novel.

01:15.326 --> 01:19.831
Okay, Nick, let's step away from the
champagne before somebody gets hurt.

01:20.331 --> 01:23.668
You slaved over this book
right next to me.

01:23.793 --> 01:26.129
Why would Northrop even publish it if
it's only going to tank?

01:26.254 --> 01:29.257
Have you failed to notice
you're our star author?

01:29.382 --> 01:31.885
Obviously, Elaine wouldn't
want to offend you.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.011
Honey...

01:37.307 --> 01:40.852
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't know why I said that.

01:40.977 --> 01:42.020
He's joking.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.689
Nick knows as well as anyone
what you have done is art.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.691
So is folding paper
into animal shapes,

01:46.816 --> 01:48.359
but you don't expect
to make a living off it.

01:48.485 --> 01:49.652
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:49.778 --> 01:51.780
You really think someone who goes
through 10 assistants a year

01:51.905 --> 01:54.032
and doesn't return
her own children's phone calls

01:54.157 --> 01:56.659
would give a damn about the state
of the American short story?

01:56.785 --> 01:58.411
Please, be quiet.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.871
(SNIFFLES)

02:03.625 --> 02:05.668
I think something's wrong.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.296
That title was
a mistake, too.

02:08.421 --> 02:10.548
People are going to
compare you to Salinger.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.760
(CHUCKLING) And boy, are you going
to come up short in that one.

02:18.765 --> 02:19.849
(GASPS) Honey?

02:20.725 --> 02:23.853
Call 911.
Help! We need help!

02:57.637 --> 03:00.139
FOREMAN: Cameron brought
this up from the ER.

03:00.557 --> 03:02.642
Doesn't look like
a friendship bracelet.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.477
KUTNER: It's Phineas Gage.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.312
The most famous case study
in medical history.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.439
You're telling me
this patient got a rail road spike

03:08.565 --> 03:09.774
drilled through
his frontal lobe?

03:09.899 --> 03:12.902
No, no trauma, but he does have
frontal lobe disinhibition.

03:13.027 --> 03:13.945
Just like Gage.

03:14.070 --> 03:15.780
Gage was a different person
after the spike.

03:15.905 --> 03:17.365
Argumentative, impulsive.

03:17.490 --> 03:20.326
Whereas our guy became
a different person after chardonnay.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.120
He was sober when
they brought him in.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.664
There's also the nosebleed,
the collapse.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.165
- MRI show anything?
- Nothing.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.543
Good. What fun
would that be?

03:28.668 --> 03:30.587
So the tumor's not in
the cool neighborhood.

03:30.712 --> 03:31.963
It's cool
neighborhood adjacent.

03:32.088 --> 03:33.923
A well-placed tumor
in the nasal cavity,

03:34.048 --> 03:35.550
eroding into the brain
could do the damage.

03:35.675 --> 03:38.887
Go stick a scope up
Phineas' nose and see what you find.

03:45.977 --> 03:48.855
Daddy, I'm always going to win if you
keep telling me what your cards are.

03:48.980 --> 03:52.525
Then suppose I tell you...
While I tickle you!

03:52.650 --> 03:54.986
Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub
and this is Dr. Kutner.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.322
We're here for another test.
Sorry about that.

03:57.906 --> 03:59.949
You don't look sorry.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.160
Um. No offense.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.287
Although you do look
kind of cheerful.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.705
It's a little creepy.
Should I want a doctor

04:05.830 --> 04:07.332
who's
excited about how sick I am?

04:07.457 --> 04:09.626
- I'm not...
- We're going to put this up your nose,

04:09.751 --> 04:11.461
scan for any problems.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.839
I can assure you that we are completely
unexcited about that.

04:14.964 --> 04:16.591
Excuse me, sweetie.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.843
She has an auditory
processing disability.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.638
Marika Balika.
You have to get off the bed.

04:23.556 --> 04:26.059
This might be
slightly uncomfortable.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.019
Honey, do you mind
if I step out?

04:28.144 --> 04:29.437
I have to make sure
the final arrangements

04:29.562 --> 04:31.147
are in place
for the breast cancer walk.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.440
Yeah. You do that.

04:32.565 --> 04:36.986
I'll pretend to be macho while a guy
stuffs three feet of plastic up my nose.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.197
It's too bad
it's not your nose.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.282
Lots more room
to maneuver.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.494
I guess the walk
can wait 10 minutes.

04:44.619 --> 04:46.579
Or in a sensible world,
even longer.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.499
Just how does tying up traffic for
six hours stop breast cancer?

04:49.624 --> 04:51.209
You know how it works,
people donate.

04:51.334 --> 04:54.712
Why not spend six hours building houses
for Habitat for Humanity?

04:54.879 --> 04:57.173
Or is it wrong to help two groups
of people at once?

04:57.298 --> 04:59.884
I'll bet there are those
who have breast cancer and no home.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.803
It's my job, Nick.

05:01.928 --> 05:03.513
You walked yourself
last year.

05:03.638 --> 05:04.639
To be supportive.

05:04.764 --> 05:08.226
Because I knew you
wouldn't have sex with me if I didn't.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.312
I'm going to make my call.

05:13.606 --> 05:15.191
Make this go away.

05:16.401 --> 05:18.987
God, that honker
really is huge, isn't it?

05:22.865 --> 05:24.075
Wednesday night.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.828
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie
versus the Incinerator.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.496
I can't.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.915
Let me rephrase.
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie...

05:31.040 --> 05:33.501
WILSON: I understand
Monster Truck code.

05:33.626 --> 05:34.711
Do you understand "can't"?

05:34.836 --> 05:37.422
Not when it follows
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.216
Is the world coming
to an end Tuesday night?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.760
- Otherwise, Wednesday...
- All right.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.680
It's not "can't,"
it's "don't want to."

05:46.556 --> 05:49.684
The fact is,
I just don't like monster trucks.

05:51.019 --> 05:52.103
Yes, you do.

05:52.228 --> 05:53.229
No, I don't.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.106
You've always liked
monster trucks.

05:55.273 --> 05:56.441
No, you've always
liked them.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.735
I've tolerated them.

05:58.985 --> 06:01.946
Seriously, I can only watch
so many hyped-up dune buggies

06:02.071 --> 06:05.742
crush so many motor homes without
feeling the urge to go see La BohÃ©me.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.702
And I hate opera, too.

06:08.578 --> 06:10.413
What are you hiding?

06:10.538 --> 06:13.166
I'm not hiding it,
I'm saying it loud and proud.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.792
Death to monster trucks.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.627
No nasal cancer.

06:16.753 --> 06:18.087
And no marriage either,

06:18.212 --> 06:20.423
if our patient keeps saying everything
that comes into his head

06:20.548 --> 06:22.550
without regard
for the consequences.

06:22.675 --> 06:24.844
You always led me to believe
you were one of a kind.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.055
Luckily, jerkiness is
a temporary condition for this guy.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.639
No, it's not.

06:28.765 --> 06:31.350
We may be able to fix his impulse
to say his thoughts out loud,

06:31.476 --> 06:33.561
but he's always gonna be
the guy who thinks them.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.314
But he's also
gonna be the guy who doesn't say them.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.858
If he spent his whole life
constructing a nice-guy persona,

06:38.983 --> 06:42.028
isn't that as much
who he really is as anything else?

06:42.153 --> 06:44.822
You would argue that.
You're all persona.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.034
I agree with Wilson.
This guy's a Harry Potter.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.412
The sorting hat was going to put Harry
in Slytherin, based on his nature.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.748
He refused,
so he ended up in Gryffindor.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.041
Through choice.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.377
There's damage somewhere
in his brain. Go find it.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.881
THIRTEEN: Are you sure
you understand?

07:02.006 --> 07:04.634
No, I'm lying.
Except, I can't.

07:06.052 --> 07:07.428
You ask me questions.

07:07.553 --> 07:11.015
While I talk, you look at my brain
activity to see where it's screwed up,

07:11.140 --> 07:13.392
then you're gonna
cut the screwed up part out to test it.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.394
It's depressing,
but it's not rocket science.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.854
I think he understands.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.023
I don't mean
to be abrasive.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.776
Especially since
you're such a pleasure to imagine naked.

07:21.901 --> 07:23.528
- Again, sorry.
- It's okay.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.822
Thank you for
understanding.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.573
I'd do you, though.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.742
Really, my apologies.
This stuff just comes out.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.869
- It's okay.
- House paged?

07:31.994 --> 07:36.040
Whoa. I would do her in a minute
with fudge and a cherry on top.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.418
Would someone please explain
to this woman?

07:39.544 --> 07:40.670
There's only so many
apologies I can...

07:40.795 --> 07:42.505
He has frontal
lobe disinhibition.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.841
I've already embarrassed
myself with one doctor.

07:44.966 --> 07:46.092
Whom I am
at this moment

07:46.217 --> 07:50.304
imagining with you in a king-sized bed
with a mirror on the ceiling.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.474
I am so, so sorry.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.226
But if I couldn't have
both of you together,

07:55.351 --> 07:57.562
you would definitely be
my first choice.

07:57.687 --> 07:58.646
Where's House?

07:58.771 --> 08:00.481
It's like trying not
to think of an elephant.

08:00.606 --> 08:04.360
Not that you're an elephant. Your
breasts, in fact, are all Homo sapiens.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.405
- House isn't here.
- He wouldn't have paged me

08:07.530 --> 08:10.074
if he couldn't watch
and enjoy the...

08:16.164 --> 08:19.250
Your tush is like
the pistons in a Ferrari.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.511
You're welcome.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.013
That was for my benefit?

08:32.138 --> 08:33.931
- You're 40 years old...
- Thirty eight.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.099
...and the administrator
of a hospital.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.309
Dean of medicine.

08:36.434 --> 08:38.019
People don't get
personal with you.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.980
Except for me, and you dismiss me
as a jerk who's jerking you around.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.773
But that guy can
only tell the truth.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.776
And he prefers your body to that
of a smoking young hottie.

08:45.902 --> 08:49.614
So that was your way of saying
I look good today?

08:50.531 --> 08:53.618
You didn't get
the slightest kick out of that?

08:54.327 --> 08:56.454
Don't be ridiculous, House.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.086
FOREMAN: I hope you know
your pistons are second to none.

09:04.420 --> 09:07.548
I'm okay. I'm not jealous
of Cuddy's pistons.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.217
Starting baseline
activation.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.552
You sure?
You looked upset.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.763
What he was saying
was obnoxious.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.139
You've never been
called attractive?

09:15.264 --> 09:18.726
He didn't call me attractive,
he cast me in his mental porno.

09:18.851 --> 09:19.685
That's what
"attractive" means.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.562
It means
"I'm attracted to you sexually."

09:21.687 --> 09:22.855
"Attracted" can also mean,

09:22.980 --> 09:25.858
"I'm attracted to the whole
package, to who you are."

09:25.983 --> 09:28.361
Slight elevation
at transaxial 60.

09:28.486 --> 09:29.695
It could.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.114
It never does. It's what
women choose to hear, not what men say.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.992
Actually, it's exactly
what men say, if they have any brains.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.369
All right, we have
enough for a baseline.

09:36.494 --> 09:37.703
What can we ask him
that's indiscreet,

09:37.828 --> 09:40.373
but that
he won't hate us for knowing?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.376
Nick, do you vote
the same way as your wife?

09:43.501 --> 09:44.794
God, no.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.629
Good. He's spiking at 30.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.756
She believes I voted
for Hillary Clinton in the primary,

09:48.881 --> 09:50.174
and Obama in the general.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.551
You're thinking
I'm secretly Republican, right?

09:52.677 --> 09:53.719
Wrong.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.389
I secretly don't vote ever.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.393
Wait, you're 46
and you've never voted?

10:00.518 --> 10:03.771
Your voice is no longer attractive
to me with that note of disapproval.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.690
Although I'm sure
that will pass.

10:05.815 --> 10:06.649
Look at that.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.735
There's a spot on the cingulate gyrus
that's not lighting up.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.570
One vote makes
a difference?

10:11.696 --> 10:12.530
Not mathematically...

10:12.655 --> 10:13.531
Okay, Nick,
we've got what we need.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.950
We can't biopsy that,
it's too close to the brain stem.

10:16.075 --> 10:18.452
Could be neurosarcoidosis.
At least it's treatable.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.829
So we give him steroids
and if we're right,

10:19.954 --> 10:23.582
we should start seeing
his symptoms improve within half a day.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.671
What are you
looking at?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.381
I find your strong attachment

10:30.506 --> 10:33.134
to a working democracy
to be extremely sexy.

10:33.259 --> 10:34.927
You smooth talker.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.765
Do you think
my nose is too big?

10:39.890 --> 10:42.685
Relax. He also implied
my bedside manner was a little off.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.895
You don't agree
with that, right?

10:45.021 --> 10:45.855
No.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.692
No one's ever mentioned
your nose before?

10:49.817 --> 10:50.985
You're a plastic surgeon.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.112
- They tell me it suits my face.
- It does.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.823
Maybe. Maybe that's just
the social contract.

10:55.948 --> 10:56.907
You tell me
I look great,

10:57.033 --> 10:58.993
I tell you
you're a people person.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.747
- How can you know the truth?
- You could ask for the truth.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.999
What do you think of my nose?
Please tell me the truth.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.084
It's fine,
it's a nose.

11:08.044 --> 11:09.795
Just proving a point.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.054
Anyone sitting here?

11:18.929 --> 11:20.473
Just my persona.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.811
You know, it's amazing
the way people cling on to insults.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.731
Or what they think
are insults.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.858
So that wasn't
an insult?

11:30.983 --> 11:33.736
I'm not suggesting that
like our patient,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.780
you're hiding a dark,
sarcastic core

11:35.905 --> 11:38.491
beneath a candy shell
of compulsive niceness.

11:38.616 --> 11:40.951
I'm not always nice.
I'm not nice to you.

11:41.077 --> 11:44.663
Because you know nice bores me.
Hence, still nice.

11:45.206 --> 11:48.084
No, I'm suggesting
that you have no core.

11:48.209 --> 11:51.712
You're what whoever
you're with needs you to be.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.881
Okay, I guess that
could be insulting.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.217
But the interesting
question is why.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.761
Why do you think the world will end
in chaos and destruction

11:58.886 --> 12:00.346
if you're not there
to save it?

12:00.471 --> 12:03.724
Because when my parents
put me in the rocket, and sent me here,

12:03.849 --> 12:06.769
they said, "James, you will grow
to manhood under a yellow sun."

12:06.894 --> 12:09.271
And why did you lie
about monster trucks?

12:09.397 --> 12:10.439
I didn't.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.525
I checked your
appointment book.

12:12.650 --> 12:13.734
You've got tomorrow
night marked off,

12:13.859 --> 12:15.778
but you didn't put down
what you were doing.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.029
So you thought
someone might look at the book...

12:17.154 --> 12:20.908
I'm playing racquetball
tomorrow night with Taub.

12:21.534 --> 12:22.910
Why would you hide that?

12:23.035 --> 12:24.912
Because the world
revolves around you.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.372
I devote time
to anyone else,

12:26.497 --> 12:28.916
you'd end up stalking me
and harassing them.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.043
You say that as though
it wouldn't be fun.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.254
And maybe I didn't
want to rub your nose in the fact

12:33.379 --> 12:36.590
that we'd be doing
something you can no longer do.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.342
Because I'm nice.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.642
I thought you said
the steroids were gonna help him!

12:46.767 --> 12:47.768
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:47.893 --> 12:49.395
Is it his heart?

12:49.812 --> 12:51.939
EKG says heart's fine.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.816
It's gotta be
the kidneys.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.776
We need to get him
on dialysis.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.319
Oh, God.

12:57.445 --> 12:58.446
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

13:01.490 --> 13:03.325
He's on dialysis
and he's stable.

13:03.451 --> 13:06.036
THIRTEEN: We know
it's not systemic sclerosis.

13:06.162 --> 13:07.538
Hey.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.874
Cyrano de Berkowitz.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.292
Let it go.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.671
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia could
explain brain and kidney problems.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.591
CBC showed normal
white blood cells.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.303
So how long have you been
playing racquetball with Wilson?

13:22.428 --> 13:24.138
Four or five times.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.723
Could be diabetes.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.516
Or a congenital
metabolic disorder.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.936
Congenital disorders generally don't
wait till you're 46 to manifest.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.356
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter
has a neurological condition.

13:34.482 --> 13:37.860
First of all, Wilson played tennis
on his college team,

13:37.985 --> 13:40.654
and you are a Jew.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.781
You're not athletic.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.742
Run to the end of
the hall and back, I'll time you.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.661
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest
left-handed pitcher of all time.

13:47.786 --> 13:52.791
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews
go on about, Sandy Koufax.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.919
And the Holocaust.
It gets old.

13:55.044 --> 13:58.422
There are dozens of congenital
conditions that fit our parameters.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.466
We can't spend time
gene-testing for all of them

14:00.591 --> 14:02.510
especially when we're only
guessing it's congenital.

14:02.635 --> 14:05.304
Is a Z-shot offensive
or defensive?

14:05.429 --> 14:06.597
It's both.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.766
You suspected that
was a trick question.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.643
But I could have
said neither.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.811
Diabetes makes
more sense.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.731
We can narrow the testing
down to 40 likely candidates.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.233
Test for peripheral
nerve damage.

14:17.358 --> 14:18.400
He's got
brain damage,

14:18.526 --> 14:20.819
he's likely to have peripheral nerve
damage no matter what the cause.

14:20.945 --> 14:23.113
Yes, that's why we should not
test him for it.

14:23.239 --> 14:24.865
Test the daughter.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.700
Kutner runs
the nerve test.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.827
Taub, you may be right
about the diabetes.

14:28.953 --> 14:32.331
Take supper away from our patient
and run a glucose tolerance test.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.543
Oh, and the nurses
have been working so hard,

14:35.668 --> 14:37.294
you can do the blood
draws yourself.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.838
They have to be done
every couple of hours.

14:39.964 --> 14:40.798
You're punishing me

14:40.923 --> 14:43.342
because you're jealous that I'm spending
time with your best friend.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.677
That would be petty.

14:44.802 --> 14:48.556
I'm punishing you because now you've
joined my best friend in lying to me.

14:48.681 --> 14:51.725
Let me know when you're ready
to confess everything.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.653
These can become
either hot or cold.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.739
As soon as it starts to feel
uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.616
But you don't think
there's something wrong with me.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.077
No, baby.
They're testing you to help Daddy.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.079
Yes. What you're doing
is very important.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.290
It's like the better
you do,

15:14.415 --> 15:16.500
the better we know
your dad is.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.295
It's okay.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.591
I'll start with heat.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.140
I know it's not his fault.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.934
I know what he says
is involuntary, but...

15:35.394 --> 15:36.895
It doesn't help.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.898
Inside he's still
the same man.

15:40.024 --> 15:41.900
Yeah, that's the problem.

15:42.026 --> 15:44.153
Apparently he's been
thinking this stuff all along.

15:44.278 --> 15:48.824
Whoever that same man is, it's not the
person I thought I was married to.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.242
You Okay?

15:53.621 --> 15:55.623
She should be feeling
something by now.

15:55.748 --> 15:59.835
What does that mean?
Is she sick too? Marika?

16:00.711 --> 16:02.046
Honey?

16:03.422 --> 16:05.716
You're burned, why didn't you tell me
it started to hurt?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.009
I wanted to help Daddy.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.845
You said the better I do,
the better Daddy has to be.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.221
I'm sorry.

16:13.641 --> 16:14.850
I'm starving.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.935
It's the only way
we can do the test.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.271
Good thing it's you
and not Dr. Hadley.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.857
Could you keep her
away from me?

16:21.982 --> 16:24.652
I have a rich
imaginative life.

16:24.777 --> 16:27.446
- I'd rather not share it.
- We all have thoughts.

16:27.655 --> 16:30.366
I know we all have
sexual thoughts.

16:30.491 --> 16:31.950
We have ignoble thoughts.

16:32.076 --> 16:34.662
I just don't want those
to be who I am to people.

16:34.787 --> 16:35.829
Especially not
to my wife.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.998
I understand, I don't think it would be
fair to define me

16:38.123 --> 16:39.291
by my passing thoughts.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.001
My real choices
are my actions.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.838
And I've never done anything
to hurt her, I've never cheated.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.633
You're kidding me,
you've cheated?

16:47.758 --> 16:48.842
What?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.052
No.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.012
Why would you say that?

16:52.137 --> 16:54.431
Because you look
guilty as hell.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.558
Are you serious?

16:56.684 --> 16:57.726
Of course you're serious.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.561
Yes, everyone knows.

16:59.687 --> 17:02.231
God, they must think
you're a creep.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.526
They might not know,
they might be idiots.

17:05.651 --> 17:06.944
I just say these things.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.415
Why'd YOU page me here?

17:19.915 --> 17:23.252
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.837
He seems to be dead.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.964
Why'd YOU page me here?

17:27.089 --> 17:30.300
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition

17:30.426 --> 17:32.970
while hitting this
against the wall.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.681
This is the only place
we can do both.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.766
I finished the
last blood draw.

17:37.891 --> 17:42.229
I expect the people
who work for me to rise to a challenge.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.065
Unless they don't
expect to work for me.

17:57.411 --> 17:58.704
(SIGHS)

18:02.040 --> 18:05.377
Last blood draw
was at 6:00 a.m.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.881
His sugar levels never rose
above 120 all night.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.429
So the glucose was normal.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.806
It means you were wrong
about diabetes.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.516
I still think it's
the endocrine system,

18:19.641 --> 18:22.060
maybe I just got
the wrong gland.

18:22.186 --> 18:26.648
You were going for thyroid
instead of pancreas? It makes sense.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.737
(CLATTERING)

18:33.071 --> 18:36.200
Fine! I'm not playing
racquetball with Wilson!

18:36.325 --> 18:37.618
I was never playing
racquetball with Wilson!

18:37.743 --> 18:41.079
I have never played
racquetball with Wilson.

18:41.997 --> 18:45.501
I thought it would be helpful
if a department head owed me a favor,

18:45.626 --> 18:47.544
but it's not worth this.

18:48.837 --> 18:52.341
Not bad.
You put on a good show.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.718
You studied up,
Wilson actually booked a court.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.137
If you were really
a racquetball player,

18:57.262 --> 19:00.224
you'd know that you're holding
a squash racquet.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.853
Tell Kutner to do
a thyroid reuptake scan,

19:04.978 --> 19:07.648
then go grab a nap
in one of the on-call rooms.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.610
KUTNER: We're taking you to do a thyroid
reuptake scan. We think your...

19:11.777 --> 19:13.487
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain

19:13.654 --> 19:15.405
why my daughter has
a bandage on her hand.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.366
You just said you wanted
to run some test.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.410
If I'd known it would involve pain,
I'd have said, "Hell no."

19:20.536 --> 19:21.453
It's a mild burn.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.997
Since Marika has a neurological
disability, like you,

19:24.122 --> 19:26.291
- we needed to make sure.
- She has no disability.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.086
Nick, you know about her problem
with auditory processing.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.921
Auditory processing?

19:31.046 --> 19:34.132
That's code, for "I can't stand thinking
my daughter's not perfect."

19:34.258 --> 19:36.218
The therapist said
Marika's test scores...

19:36.343 --> 19:38.136
Were indeterminate.

19:38.262 --> 19:41.598
She doesn't have a disability.
She daydreams.

19:41.723 --> 19:46.395
She gets below average marks in school
because she's below average.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.106
Every parent
thinks their child is above average.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.274
- Nick!
- Do they have any idea

19:50.399 --> 19:53.569
what the word average means?
Somebody has to be under it.

19:53.694 --> 19:54.862
Nick, shut up!

20:00.909 --> 20:02.160
Honey.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.456
I'm not saying
you're stupid.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.126
Your mother's not
the sharpest crayon in the box,

20:09.251 --> 20:10.878
and she does great.

20:12.379 --> 20:17.217
See, this is why
I told your mother to keep you at home.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.094
Didn't want you here.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.388

Your lungs are full of fluid,

20:31.940 --> 20:33.650
I need 200 milligrams
of furosemide

20:33.775 --> 20:35.569
and two milligrams
of morphine, stat.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.532
- His temperature is 103.
- Infection.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.326
The steroids must have
forced it into the open.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.994
What kind of infection?
It could be anything.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.121
Staph aureus,
tuberculosis, strongyloides.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.748
Go back to Phineas
and get a history.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.625
We got a history.
He hasn't been out of the country.

20:49.750 --> 20:50.834
Get a detailed history.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.086
No one at home is sick,
no one at work is sick,

20:53.211 --> 20:54.671
there's no sign of ticks
or mosquitoes.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.548
Get a more
detailed history.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.800
Ask him again.
And again, until he remembers something.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.511
Not you.
Kutner can do it.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.640
You're going to be busy
with something else.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.773
I'm here to invite you
to lunch.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.858
Why?

21:18.862 --> 21:22.699
I've been made. House sent me
back to you as a double agent.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.415
Anything wrong?

21:30.540 --> 21:31.833
Eyes are a little red.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.085
There's a shocker.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.921
I haven't had a good night's sleep
since this thing started.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.799
You should get
some rest yourself.

21:38.924 --> 21:39.967
That's a good idea.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.470
This is going to take
some time, it will be pretty exhaustive.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.639
Are you afraid of
what you might say while I'm here?

21:45.764 --> 21:46.807
Yes.

21:47.265 --> 21:50.143
Are you telling me there's something
worse than what I've already heard?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.647
No, I don't know
what I'm going to say.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.816
I don't know how I'm
going to hurt you next.

21:55.941 --> 21:59.861
I think we should be around each other
as little as possible right now.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.826
This is pathetic.

22:05.951 --> 22:06.952
I know.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.540
Tell Marika
I love her very much.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.084
She understands that.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.794
I don't think she does.

22:17.254 --> 22:20.507
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.342
Yeah.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.735
Guy leads a boring life.
They stay home a lot.

22:39.985 --> 22:43.155
No travel, no exotic pets.
No nearby standing water.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.574
You sound pleased about something.
Can we get to that part?

22:45.699 --> 22:47.951
His wife rescues dogs.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.829
Among others, a big Rottweiler,
who's taken over the house.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.164
Our patient hates it.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.291
- Was the wife there to hear this?
- No.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.584
Too bad. Keep going.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.295
The dog marks its territory
all over the living room.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.504
I asked what
the odds were

22:59.629 --> 23:02.424
that he would've put down food or drink
where the dog could reach.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.134
He said he put
a glass of juice on the floor

23:04.259 --> 23:05.260
while he was fixing
the television.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.554
- The dog was fixing the television?
- Yes.

23:07.679 --> 23:08.722
Patient's eyes red?

23:08.847 --> 23:10.807
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.

23:11.516 --> 23:14.186
Bacterial.
You lucked out.

23:14.311 --> 23:15.979
Start him on doxycycline.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.648
If he improves,
we'll know we were right.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.570
I told Wilson you sent me
to get information.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.155
And now you're
telling me.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.033
What does that make you,
a quadruple agent?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.494
He let me print out
his e-mails.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.620
Wow. Excellent.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.747
Information
he wants us to have.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.791
Did he let you print out
his deleted e-mails?

23:35.916 --> 23:37.167
- No.
- Go back there...

23:37.375 --> 23:38.502
As long as I was
sitting there,

23:38.627 --> 23:42.047
thought I'd print them anyway.
Top one's the one you're looking for.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.593
"I confirm Wednesday
at 7:00 p.m."

23:46.718 --> 23:50.472
It's outgoing
to JGonzalez@NYMercy.net.

23:50.597 --> 23:54.726
There's a Joan Gonzalez
in oncology. It's a consult.

23:54.851 --> 23:57.270
Secret consult
at 7:00 p.m.?

23:57.979 --> 24:00.524
Oh, Joan is perky.

24:00.649 --> 24:03.652
You're wrong, there was
a patient file attached.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.611
Where?

24:04.736 --> 24:05.946
It was password protected.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.072
No.

24:07.572 --> 24:10.784
Wilson doesn't password
protect his patient files.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.744
I'm the only one
he'd expect ever to look there,

24:12.869 --> 24:15.747
and he knows there's
only one patient I'd want to check on.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.458
You think
Wilson's sick?

24:19.960 --> 24:21.503
If Wilson had cancer,

24:21.628 --> 24:23.713
there'd be no reason for him to drive
three hours to Manhattan.

24:23.839 --> 24:26.091
He knows he could pull strings here
to get the best treatment.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.301
Six articles by Gonzalez.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.596
"Managing suicidal thoughts
in oncology patients."

24:31.721 --> 24:34.641
"Suicidal ideation in
children with leukemia."

24:34.766 --> 24:36.101
I don't want
to ask this,

24:36.226 --> 24:39.855
but have you ever had reason to think
he might be depressed?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.691
No. Get out of here.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.913
KUTNER: Your fever's down
and your lungs are clearing.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.000
How long before this
brain thing goes away?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.376
Infection's gone.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.880
The damage the infection did,
you'll have to live with.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.883
You telling me
you can't fix this?

25:08.008 --> 25:09.426
There's got to be a way...

25:09.551 --> 25:12.262
We'd need to remove the damaged area
in your cingulate gyrus,

25:12.387 --> 25:14.472
but it's too close
to the brain stem to risk surgery.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.141
You can't risk it?

25:16.725 --> 25:18.351
But I could shop around,

25:18.476 --> 25:20.645
and maybe some better doctors
at a better hospital...

25:20.770 --> 25:23.481
The brain stem controls the body's
involuntary systems.

25:23.607 --> 25:26.067
The slightest mistake
could kill you.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.819
Even if you survive,

25:27.944 --> 25:30.238
you may never be able to breathe
on your own again, you may never...

25:30.363 --> 25:31.740
I get it.

25:31.865 --> 25:34.075
I know this seems
like a lot to deal with right now,

25:34.201 --> 25:38.538
but people have adapted to living with
all kinds of neurological deficits.

25:38.663 --> 25:41.875
Hey, at least we can promise you
it won't get any worse.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.169
Get the hell
out of my room.

25:52.844 --> 25:54.137
(SIGHS)

25:55.972 --> 26:00.685
Your assistant said that you were
out of the hospital taking a walk.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.022
- Is there an emergency?
- I don't know, is there?

26:05.023 --> 26:08.235
You never take a walk unless you got
something you need to think about.

26:08.610 --> 26:12.572
Maybe you just don't have a good
statistical sampling of my walks.

26:12.697 --> 26:16.910
The other thing you do when you need to
think is you come to my office.

26:17.035 --> 26:17.994
Apparently, this is something

26:18.119 --> 26:22.082
you can only discuss with
Gonzalez at New York Mercy.

26:26.127 --> 26:30.215
Taub. Another graduate
of the House School of Being a Dick.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.424
Private dick.

26:31.549 --> 26:35.470
Look, I'd love to stay for the full
inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.

26:40.016 --> 26:43.311
Of course you need hot coffee,
it's 45 degrees outside

26:43.436 --> 26:46.815
and you left your
coat upstairs. Why?

26:46.940 --> 26:49.859
You're going to tell me
why I forgot my coat?

26:49.985 --> 26:52.862
Once you get outside,
the cold would have reminded you.

26:52.988 --> 26:55.031
Could have gone back,
but you didn't.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.534
You chose to be
uncomfortable.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.538
Now why would someone
choose that?

27:02.455 --> 27:04.791
Because they
hate themselves?

27:04.916 --> 27:07.002
Has it ever occurred to you that
when I don't share something,

27:07.127 --> 27:09.129
it might not be meant
as a challenge?

27:09.254 --> 27:11.047
It might just mean
that I'd like there to be

27:11.172 --> 27:15.260
one molecule of my life
that goes unexamined by Gregory House.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.819
Nick Greenwald. I hear you're
the guy in charge.

27:34.446 --> 27:37.365
I'm the patient
with the disinhibition.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.784
If you're here to say thanks,
you're welcome. Now go away.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.953
I'm not thankful.
I'm pissed.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.163
Oh.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.664
All the more reason
to go away.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.542
They're talking about
sending me home.

27:48.251 --> 27:51.546
To what? A life where I'll
continually drive away anyone who might,

27:51.671 --> 27:53.715
for a second,
care about me?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.592
Those are the breaks.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.765
You could operate.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.935
You could die.

28:06.978 --> 28:10.398
So I'm either better or dead?
I'm okay with that.

28:16.613 --> 28:20.408
I've always been kind of
an impatient guy.

28:21.493 --> 28:23.953
But I've worked hard
to keep my mouth shut.

28:24.079 --> 28:27.540
I've made my wife happy.
I've made my little girl happy.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.544
I want that back.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.297
Otherwise, it's no life.

28:43.431 --> 28:45.934
I want you to remove
a small problem.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.689
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

28:51.815 --> 28:54.317
Your boss is.
You could assist,

28:54.442 --> 28:56.653
I'm sure you'd like
to add to your resume.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.738
It's too near the brain stem.
Nobody's going to touch it.

28:58.863 --> 29:01.908
Your boss would.
He's an egomaniac.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.536
I know 'cause I keep
seeing him at the club.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.204
He just needs
a little push.

29:06.329 --> 29:09.624
I'm sure by now you've kissed
his ass sufficiently.

29:09.749 --> 29:10.875
(CHUCKLES)

29:11.876 --> 29:14.838
Would you like me to phrase it
as "you're politically gifted"?

29:14.963 --> 29:16.714
I could do that.

29:17.882 --> 29:20.343
(CLEARS THROAT)
You want me to help you?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.013
Tell me why.

29:24.681 --> 29:25.723
Why what?

29:25.849 --> 29:26.933
Why you care?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.644
The puzzle's solved,
the guy's alive.

29:29.769 --> 29:30.979
And the odds of coming out
of this surgery

29:31.104 --> 29:33.314
with that
same status aren't that great.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.317
My patient has
a quality of life issue.

29:36.443 --> 29:39.904
He says awful things.
Hardly a medical condition.

29:41.114 --> 29:44.784
When he leaves here,
he's going to lose his family.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.911
He's going to alienate
the people he works with.

29:47.036 --> 29:50.540
And if he ever finds a friend who's
willing to put up with his crap,

29:50.665 --> 29:52.041
he'll be lucky.

29:54.002 --> 29:56.463
Until he drives
them away, too.

30:01.593 --> 30:03.761
I'll see what I can do.

30:28.703 --> 30:32.040
You've apparently got this
whole coat thing backwards.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.918
I may have overreacted.

30:35.752 --> 30:38.046
You definitely overreacted.

30:38.171 --> 30:39.964
I knew you'd
meet me halfway.

30:40.089 --> 30:41.174
But it made me think.

30:41.299 --> 30:45.053
You only snap
on one subject, losing people.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.931
So I went back
to the Intel.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.392
It's true there's only one doctor named
Gonzalez at New York Mercy,

30:51.518 --> 30:55.647
but there's a Javier Gonzalez
who's a nurse in the psych ward.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.691
Now who could you lose
who'd end up there?

30:58.816 --> 31:03.238
Maybe the reason I don't always open up
to you is because it's redundant.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.864
Daniel Wilson.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.367
Once you've got a name,

31:07.492 --> 31:10.495
it's amazing how much stuff
you can learn on the phone.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.915
I mean,
if you're a doctor and you lie freely.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.959
They found your brother
sleeping in the lobby

31:16.084 --> 31:18.211
of an office building in Manhattan.

31:18.336 --> 31:19.671
He got aggressive
when they asked him to leave,

31:19.796 --> 31:22.507
and the cops took him
to the Mercy psych ward.

31:22.632 --> 31:25.426
There've been new anti-psychotics
developed since he ran away.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.680
He's been on them
for a couple of days. And by tonight,

31:28.805 --> 31:30.765
he should be in shape
to talk to me.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.393
But you're not sure
if he wants to.

31:34.811 --> 31:38.398
I'll be in New York in a few hours,
I guess I'll find out.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.567
Why wouldn't you
tell me this?

31:40.692 --> 31:42.026
House, you and I,

31:43.528 --> 31:46.447
we don't have the
normal social contract.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.533
I don't expect you
to tell me the lies that...

31:48.658 --> 31:51.119
I'm fully capable
of lying to you.

31:51.244 --> 31:52.704
I've lied plenty of times.

31:52.829 --> 31:54.956
I mean collaborative lies.

31:55.081 --> 31:59.752
Giving someone a hand who maybe needs
to deceive themselves, just a little.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.298
For two days,
I've been thinking about

32:03.423 --> 32:05.300
how Danny's going to
react when he sees me.

32:05.425 --> 32:08.094
If I said that
to anybody else, they'd say,

32:08.219 --> 32:10.388
"Don't worry,
it'll all be all right."

32:10.972 --> 32:12.515
You wouldn't.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.727
Because it might
all go horribly wrong.

32:15.852 --> 32:17.020
(CHUCKLES)

32:18.521 --> 32:19.814
Yeah.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.817
Yeah, it might.

32:23.443 --> 32:27.405
In which case,
you might want some company.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.372
FOREMAN: Your heart's beating.
First hurdle passed.

32:36.497 --> 32:39.751
Now we need to know
if you can breathe for yourself.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.086
(COUGHS)

32:42.211 --> 32:43.338
(GASPS)

32:43.463 --> 32:44.964
Oh, thank God.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.427
Now, do you know
who you are?

32:50.928 --> 32:54.057
Nick Greenwald,
former S.O.B.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.808
(LAUGHS)

32:55.933 --> 32:57.101
Thank you.

32:58.394 --> 33:02.690
Now I can go back to my beautiful life
with my beautiful wife.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.943
Maybe she'll stop whining
and cut me some slack

33:06.069 --> 33:08.321
now that I've
risked my life.

33:09.489 --> 33:11.366
It doesn't make sense.
We removed the problem.

33:11.491 --> 33:14.035
We removed the damage.
Maybe we were wrong about the problem.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.162
I need to believe
we can get through this.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.413
FOREMAN:
Temperature's 94.5.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.041
Do you really think
I'm stupid?

33:20.166 --> 33:24.337
Honey, you're not stupid,
you're just... Please don't do this.

33:24.462 --> 33:25.463
Could be the effect
of the surgery.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.006
Do you at least
respect me, Nick?

33:27.131 --> 33:28.841
What do you think of
what I do for a living?

33:28.966 --> 33:32.261
I think people who publicize
important things

33:32.387 --> 33:35.473
are people who can't do
important things themselves.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.558
Honey, stop. Don't.

33:37.684 --> 33:38.935
Do you regret
marrying me?

33:39.102 --> 33:41.187
- 94.2.
- Sometimes.

33:41.479 --> 33:43.231
- Everybody wonders.
- Get me a heating blanket.

33:43.356 --> 33:44.732
Do you even love me?

33:44.857 --> 33:45.692
Yes.

33:46.567 --> 33:47.652
I don't know why.

33:47.777 --> 33:48.653
Aud...

33:49.112 --> 33:51.114
Wait. Let me...

33:51.239 --> 33:52.281
(MACHINE BEEPING)

33:52.407 --> 33:54.492
V-tach! Get me the paddles.

33:59.622 --> 34:00.957
FOREMAN: Clear.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.713
Echo says his heart
is structurally fine,

34:06.838 --> 34:08.131
but his temperature
is still dropping.

34:08.256 --> 34:09.757
He's headed
for hypothermia.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.759
I can't reach House.
It just goes to voice-mail.

34:11.884 --> 34:12.885
Means we were wrong
about infection.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.554
His temperature's
just going up and down

34:14.679 --> 34:16.180
because something's
playing with his thermostat.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.932
Which means
the brain damage is spreading.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.600
What causes brain damage
and nosebleed,

34:19.726 --> 34:21.477
and involves the lungs,
heart, and kidneys?

34:21.602 --> 34:23.271
Cancer. We could text him.

34:23.396 --> 34:24.480
It's not cancer.

34:24.605 --> 34:27.775
Normal PSA, normal blood smear,
colonoscopy normal.

34:28.443 --> 34:29.444
Do a full body scan.

34:29.569 --> 34:30.862
House hates
full body scans.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.822
- House isn't here.
- House is right.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.991
Everybody's got three or four
meaningless anomalies

34:35.116 --> 34:36.033
that'll come up on a scan.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.077
Chasing each one will take
time we don't have.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.371
Feel free to
send him an IM.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.151
(SIGHS)

35:26.000 --> 35:29.629
You told me you saw your brother once,
after he disappeared.

35:29.754 --> 35:31.547
Thirteen years ago.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.800
I used to go to Princeton
whenever I could.

35:33.925 --> 35:36.677
I must have hit every
homeless shelter in town.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.930
Then one day, I'm just sitting
at this deli having a sandwich,

35:39.055 --> 35:42.475
I look out the window
and there he is.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.269
He was gone by the time
I got outside.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.354
That's why you were so eager,

35:46.479 --> 35:48.689
when I told you there was
a job in Princeton.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.107
I thought it was
just my charm.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.609
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

35:52.276 --> 35:54.070
That's the team,
shouldn't you answer?

35:54.195 --> 35:57.532
They've already texted me to say
they're doing something stupid.

35:58.741 --> 36:00.326
Small abdominal aneurysm.

36:00.451 --> 36:01.536
Irrelevant.
What else you got?

36:01.661 --> 36:03.371
A cyst in the pleura
around the lungs.

36:03.496 --> 36:05.581
Also irrelevant.
Couldn't cause any of the symptoms.

36:05.706 --> 36:07.166
There's a density
in the liver,

36:07.291 --> 36:08.960
could be a vascular
malformation.

36:09.085 --> 36:11.671
If he's got multiple AVMs, screwed up
blood flow would explain everything.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.673
We can only spot them
with angiography.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.216
We'll have to do targeted
scans with contrast,

36:15.341 --> 36:16.259
and then embolize each one.

36:16.384 --> 36:17.510
Can we do that
before he freezes?

36:17.635 --> 36:19.262
We'll find out.

36:20.847 --> 36:24.976
The spell-correct on Kutner's phone
has got a hair-trigger.

36:25.101 --> 36:27.770
Either that, or the patient
has a "cyclone"

36:27.895 --> 36:30.439
in the "floral"
of his lungs.

36:32.108 --> 36:36.612
You took a walk in 45-degree weather
and you left your coat behind.

36:39.866 --> 36:40.908
Go ahead.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.994
I think you were
punishing yourself.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.038
I think you wanted to feel what it
would be like to be homeless

36:46.163 --> 36:47.915
in a New Jersey winter.

36:49.083 --> 36:51.294
That tells me guilt.

36:52.169 --> 36:54.630
That tells me
something happened.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.886
The schizophrenia started
when he was a teenager.

37:00.011 --> 37:02.471
When he was in college,

37:02.597 --> 37:03.890
he was on meds,

37:04.015 --> 37:07.310
but he'd still think a professor was out
to get him because he got a B,

37:07.435 --> 37:09.312
or he would fight with his roommates
because he never showered.

37:09.437 --> 37:10.605
Where were you?

37:10.730 --> 37:11.814
Med school.

37:12.857 --> 37:18.029
He called me every day,
talked for hours.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.114
I didn't have hours.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.490
Interesting.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.411
Later for that. Go on.

37:25.536 --> 37:27.955
I was tired of being the guy
that everybody counted on.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.207
So one night
Danny called...

37:31.500 --> 37:34.921
One night Danny called,
crying, upset about something.

37:35.046 --> 37:39.425
I had to study for an exam.
So I hung up.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.261
Took my things, I went to the library

37:42.386 --> 37:43.763
where I wouldn't have to hear the phone
ring.

37:43.888 --> 37:46.599
I wonder how
that turned out.

37:46.724 --> 37:47.934
My mother called me
the next day,

37:48.059 --> 37:50.311
Danny had run away
and left his meds behind.

37:50.436 --> 37:55.691
Which I knew meant that he would never
be able to choose to come back,

37:55.816 --> 37:59.528
because he'd be so
detached from reality.

38:00.279 --> 38:04.158
So you made your one effort to live
a normal, selfish life,

38:04.283 --> 38:06.410
and the universe
immediately smacked you down.

38:06.535 --> 38:10.206
And because we're wired
to find meaning in semi-random events,

38:10.331 --> 38:13.334
you decided never to be
that careless again.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.545
You don't think
that's a little facile?

38:16.671 --> 38:20.633
Actually, I don't.
I think you did it consciously.

38:20.758 --> 38:24.428
You developed your
people pleasing talents

38:24.553 --> 38:27.598
the way an Olympic athlete
develops his muscles.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.601
Talk about an overreaction
to a single event.

38:30.726 --> 38:32.645
It was a pretty
big event.

38:32.770 --> 38:36.065
Hanging up the phone? That's what
you're blaming all this on.

38:36.190 --> 38:39.402
That's the behavior
you've been trying to correct.

38:39.527 --> 38:42.613
As though nothing else
went wrong in your brother's life.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.199
Of course he overreacted,
too, but...

38:47.660 --> 38:49.537
His glucose was normal.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.791
We're not talking about
my brother anymore, are we?

38:53.916 --> 38:55.292
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:58.045 --> 39:02.174
It's House. AVMs don't
explain his glucose.

39:02.299 --> 39:05.636
Since this is a significant moment
in my life and all, I'll...

39:05.761 --> 39:06.679
Yeah.

39:06.804 --> 39:07.972
I think I'll just
go in and...

39:08.097 --> 39:09.140
Explain that.

39:09.265 --> 39:10.516
Right.

39:11.726 --> 39:14.979
We have given him steroids.
His glucose should have been elevated.

39:15.104 --> 39:18.441
That wannabe cyst
you found in the whole body scan,

39:18.566 --> 39:20.234
without the glucose,
it's an irrelevant cyst,

39:20.359 --> 39:22.653
with the glucose,
it's a relevant fibroma.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.613
He has
Doege-Potter Syndrome.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.575
His fibroma is secreting
human growth hormone

39:27.700 --> 39:30.161
which acts like insulin,
lowering his glucose.

39:30.327 --> 39:32.955
That doesn't explain
the organ failure, the brain damage.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.541
This whole thing
is an overreaction.

39:35.666 --> 39:38.836
That one small fibroma,
it's benign,

39:38.961 --> 39:41.255
but his body's acting
like it's an invader.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.508
His antibodies went to war against it
and got carried away,

39:44.633 --> 39:47.636
attacked his other systems.
Take out the fibroma,

39:47.762 --> 39:50.681
he'll be a happy
hypocrite again in no time.

call a cab.

probably just late.

Yeah.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.240
I'm sorry about,

40:09.492 --> 40:12.369
you know,
things I said.

40:15.081 --> 40:18.334
I have
a conspicuous nose.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.086
It suits your face.

I'm sorry I'm late.

40:37.311 --> 40:38.771
I have some good news.

40:38.896 --> 40:40.773
I was going to tell you,
and then you got sick,

40:40.898 --> 40:43.400
it didn't seem like
the best time.

40:44.068 --> 40:46.570
I've been offered
a better position.

40:46.695 --> 40:50.533
I'd be coordinating cancer
awareness walks in three cities.

40:50.658 --> 40:54.036
That's great.
Congratulations.

40:54.161 --> 40:56.288
I know you've worked
hard for this.

I'll be seeing Danny
again next week.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.042
I'd like you to meet him.

41:42.168 --> 41:43.335
Sure.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.045
Sounds interesting.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.965
Go on.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.968
I thought seeing him again
would change everything.

41:51.093 --> 41:54.305
It'd be wonderful
or terrible. Instead...

41:55.764 --> 41:59.602
We're just strangers.
It's kind of anticlimactic.

I spend all my time
analyzing.

42:21.916 --> 42:23.292
"What will the effect be
if I say this?"

42:23.417 --> 42:25.961
And then there's you.
You're a reality junkie.

42:26.086 --> 42:27.963
If I offered you
a comforting lie,

42:28.088 --> 42:30.174
you'd smack me
over the head with it.

42:30.299 --> 42:32.051
Let's not change that.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.178
Okay-

42:34.720 --> 42:36.597
No. See, this...

42:37.223 --> 42:41.268
If you were implementing
a social contract, you'd say that,

42:41.393 --> 42:45.773
but only because
it makes me feel better.

42:47.650 --> 42:50.736
It's kind of fun watching you
torture yourself.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.530
Do you think things will work out
with my brother?

42:53.656 --> 42:54.657
No.

42:56.408 --> 42:59.662
But when it does go wrong,
it won't be your fault.

Thanks, House.

like monster trucks?
