02:07.825 --> 02:09.262
Alright, ready?

02:41.426 --> 02:42.728
Oh, come off it, MacNeil.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.498
Everyone knows,
whatever you've got

02:46.564 --> 02:47.533
it's bad.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.769
When you get on that ferry
tomorrow

02:49.801 --> 02:51.170
we'll be seeing the back of you

02:51.502 --> 02:53.338
- forever.
- Don't you worry.

02:53.671 --> 02:56.643
Christmas Eve, I'll be pissing
on the flowers of your grave.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.212
Drinks for everyone!

03:00.378 --> 03:01.346
On me!

03:02.348 --> 03:06.252
Tonight, we celebrate the demise
of Rory MacNeil

03:06.752 --> 03:10.456
who's going to die
far, far away.

03:11.289 --> 03:13.925
Like an old dog crawling
into a dark hole

03:13.959 --> 03:15.495
deep in the ground to die.

03:18.296 --> 03:19.931
- Give it back.
- Come and get it, cripple!

03:19.965 --> 03:21.768
Oh, not again.

04:37.709 --> 04:38.777
Fraser...

04:45.783 --> 04:48.021
I'll give you
some for the journey.

04:48.586 --> 04:51.524
After that,
you need to see your doctor.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.060
Well, that's why I have you.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.062
No, no, I'm cutting you off.

04:56.461 --> 04:59.731
These pills are used to treat
the horses.

05:00.098 --> 05:02.502
I'm a vet, for Christ's sake.

05:03.035 --> 05:04.704
Well, I'm an old horse

05:05.137 --> 05:06.906
racing towards
the finishing line.

05:07.005 --> 05:08.907
It is a line you may not cross

05:09.108 --> 05:12.078
unless you get on that flight
and get some help.

05:12.177 --> 05:16.716
Now, if you want to outlive
Campbell, you will listen to me.

05:16.815 --> 05:19.651
Oh, maybe I should just stick
the old bastard with my knife

05:20.386 --> 05:23.356
and then there'll be no need
for me to fly to America.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.724
Don't start that again.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.528
I'm not going.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.102
Dad!

06:09.634 --> 06:11.036
Dad! Hey!

06:13.137 --> 06:14.606
Can we get you a taxi, sir?

06:15.874 --> 06:16.943
Can I get you a taxi?

06:17.475 --> 06:18.610
- Hm?
- You speak English?

06:18.744 --> 06:20.113
Can I get you a ride
into the city?

06:21.814 --> 06:23.449
- Aye.
- Here, let me take that.

06:26.451 --> 06:27.452
Right this way.

06:40.531 --> 06:42.067
Rory? Rory!

06:49.807 --> 06:50.742
You.

06:51.677 --> 06:52.677
Where are you going?

06:53.211 --> 06:54.447
You never showed up.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.884
Can you give my dad
his suitcase please?

06:59.685 --> 07:00.819
Is this your son, sir?

07:07.860 --> 07:09.461
Let's go, I'm parked in the lot.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.516
The bloody lights of the city
outshine the stars.

07:30.815 --> 07:31.783
What's that, Dad?

07:33.017 --> 07:35.086
Nothing,
just admiring your city.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.692
Oh, made you something.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.500
You remember how you used to
love to ride those horses

07:47.533 --> 07:48.800
down on Donovan's farm?

07:49.201 --> 07:50.203
I do.

07:51.202 --> 07:52.838
I mean, I did love that.

07:54.673 --> 07:56.475
Maybe we can give it to Jamie?

07:58.142 --> 08:00.012
- Who?
- Jamie, our baby.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.547
Oh, yes.

08:02.146 --> 08:03.516
How is the wee lassie?

08:03.915 --> 08:05.016
Jamie's a boy.

08:05.216 --> 08:06.252
Of course.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.927
So Emily and I were wondering
what finally dragged you

08:14.959 --> 08:16.061
off the island.

08:17.062 --> 08:18.764
It was time to see you,
I told you on the phone.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.610
You can't smoke in here, Dad.

08:31.009 --> 08:32.778
It's a smoke-free environment.

08:33.879 --> 08:34.980
Smoke-free what?

08:35.313 --> 08:36.780
Smoking'll kill you, Dad.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.018
Or hasn't the memo reached
Vallasay yet?

08:40.719 --> 08:42.121
Life'll kill ya.

09:02.341 --> 09:03.609
This is it.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.119
I'd rather take the stairs,
where are they?

09:13.985 --> 09:15.855
Back that way.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.027
A man should always be able
to walk into his own house.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.829
We're on the 19th floor, Dad.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.066
Never mind.

09:36.908 --> 09:38.978
Em's dad knew someone
on the condo board

09:39.010 --> 09:42.147
otherwise... well, we'd
never have been approved.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.616
Approved?

09:46.250 --> 09:48.754
Yeah, it's how you get into
one of these places, Dad.

09:48.787 --> 09:51.123
Well, let's just keep them
guessing for another 24 hours.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.025
OK? Thank you, bye.

09:56.995 --> 09:59.064
Oh, we're so happy
to finally have you here.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.201
Why are you whispering?

10:03.969 --> 10:06.339
Oh, I just put Jamie
back to sleep.

10:06.705 --> 10:09.074
He's such a light sleeper
and uh...

10:09.106 --> 10:10.775
I know you're probably
dying to see him.

10:11.009 --> 10:12.878
Is it OK if we do that tomorrow?

10:13.445 --> 10:15.915
Oh, oh, well... aye.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.719
Great, yeah, the tenth month
is the most crucial

10:19.818 --> 10:22.353
for developing, like, a really
healthy sleeping pattern

10:22.386 --> 10:23.788
so...

10:25.289 --> 10:28.326
Oh... I got that conference call
in two minutes.

10:28.759 --> 10:31.697
Oh, Ian, also, Frida just
could not get the bed open.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.032
- So...
- That's fine, I'll do it.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.200
Thank you.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.838
Once again, really so, so happy
you're here, Dad.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.975
Why is she calling me "Dad"?

10:45.076 --> 10:47.846
It's an American thing.
Come on, let's get you sorted.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.355
Emily's dad has boxes
at the ball park.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.957
You should come. It's cool.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.659
Cool.

11:06.163 --> 11:07.198
So, Emily...

11:08.466 --> 11:10.235
she still works at the hospital?

11:10.936 --> 11:13.072
Not anymore.
She's got her own firm now.

11:15.106 --> 11:16.074
Why?

11:17.442 --> 11:18.844
You remember Doc Fraser?

11:19.443 --> 11:20.346
Sure.

11:21.746 --> 11:24.416
Well, he swore me to get
a medical check-up

11:24.517 --> 11:25.718
while I'm here.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.086
- Is everything OK?
- Oh, fine.

11:28.285 --> 11:29.254
Fit as a fiddle.

11:30.188 --> 11:31.890
Just a wee pain in the back,
that's all.

11:32.791 --> 11:35.027
Anyhow, anything to stop
the old bugger

11:35.126 --> 11:37.096
from getting
his gallices in a fangle.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.364
Keep him calm, you know.

11:41.099 --> 11:42.401
Yeah, we can arrange that.

11:43.501 --> 11:45.070
Oh, that'll be grand.

11:45.903 --> 11:47.439
So, the bathroom's
down the hall, and...

11:48.273 --> 11:49.442
I'll see you in the morning.

11:50.841 --> 11:51.976
Uh, Ian...

11:57.182 --> 11:58.717
I'm glad to see you again.

13:05.450 --> 13:06.951
Maybe I should just take a peek.

13:09.053 --> 13:11.055
- Make sure he's OK.
- No, Ian.

13:11.489 --> 13:13.292
Remember what the
sleep consultant said?

13:13.325 --> 13:14.326
No, I know, I know.

13:15.592 --> 13:17.996
He has to feel the success of
soothing himself back to sleep

13:18.096 --> 13:19.965
but come on!

13:32.309 --> 13:33.912
He didn't come here to see us.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.283
- What?
- Dad.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.085
He doesn't give a crap about us.

13:41.219 --> 13:42.855
Didn't even care
if he saw Jamie.

13:42.955 --> 13:43.989
You saw how he reacted.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.859
I think he just didn't wanna
wake him up.

13:47.192 --> 13:49.094
I thought he was being
very thoughtful.

13:50.427 --> 13:53.198
Thoughtful? Where was he
when Jamie was born?

13:54.566 --> 13:57.436
He never even replied to any
of the messages I sent him.

13:57.535 --> 14:01.039
Let alone bought him a present
or sent a card.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.043
Well, why do you think
he came then?

14:04.408 --> 14:05.977
He wants to see a doctor.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.251
Muck!

14:15.687 --> 14:18.389
I haven't seen the man
for 15 years and...

14:19.323 --> 14:23.094
he comes here to couch-surf
and scrounge a free medical.

14:25.996 --> 14:27.498
Give him a little bit
more credit, Ian.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.870
I'm sure he didn't come all
this way just to see a doctor.

14:39.644 --> 14:40.645
Oh...

14:44.716 --> 14:47.286
You've got a fine set
of lungs on you, laddie.

14:49.019 --> 14:50.154
I'll grant you that.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.332
I was thinking,
we don't even need plates

15:01.365 --> 15:03.235
we just use the table
as a canvas

15:03.335 --> 15:05.336
and then watch everyone try to
wrap their heads round

15:05.370 --> 15:06.504
how to eat it, yeah.

15:11.009 --> 15:13.345
Yeah. I know!

15:15.647 --> 15:16.615
Alright.

15:17.749 --> 15:20.019
Wait for me to try out
the new centrifuge, will you?

15:20.751 --> 15:21.920
Yeah, I'm on my way.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.091
No breakfast?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.092
This is breakfast.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.261
You're off to the laboratory?

15:30.695 --> 15:31.664
Kitchen.

15:33.398 --> 15:35.067
I'm a sous-chef at White River.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.970
- It's a restaurant.
- Didn't you study chemistry?

15:38.336 --> 15:41.407
I specialise in what's called
molecular gastronomy, Dad.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.408
How'd you sleep?

15:44.442 --> 15:46.412
Oh, like your baby.

15:47.544 --> 15:49.380
Sorry about that,
we're sleep training him.

15:51.649 --> 15:53.652
Emily not breast-feeding then?

15:54.085 --> 15:57.089
- No. She wanted to.
- Aye...

15:58.056 --> 15:59.391
but she does have breasts?

15:59.758 --> 16:01.126
- Dad!
- Good morning.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.461
There you are, Dad.
I hope you slept well.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.600
Um, oh! I wanted to let you know
I went ahead

16:08.633 --> 16:10.469
and made an appointment
for you with a doctor

16:10.769 --> 16:12.571
and I scheduled that
for tomorrow. Is that OK?

16:12.604 --> 16:14.173
Oh, I see. Ian told you.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.475
Ah, well, you know,
it's nothing serious.

16:20.577 --> 16:22.146
I think Jamie is starving.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.983
I'm on it. I'm on it!

16:26.784 --> 16:27.986
Honey...

16:29.620 --> 16:31.222
Oh, here we are.

16:31.255 --> 16:32.323
Hey, baby.

16:32.690 --> 16:33.659
Good boy.

16:34.192 --> 16:35.594
Look who came to see you.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.463
Yeah, Grandpa came to see you.
Yeah.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.334
- Grandpa came to see you.
- Alright, look. I've gotta go.

16:42.433 --> 16:43.668
- OK...
- Here you go.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.139
There we go.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.143
Oh.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.011
Do you wanna hold him?

16:53.211 --> 16:54.746
While I grab that, I...

16:55.080 --> 16:57.182
I'm late for that call,
they keep bothering me.

16:57.548 --> 16:59.451
- Oh.
- There we go, see, look.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.753
Yeah, oh.

17:02.086 --> 17:03.521
- OK...
- Oops! Hello?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.557
No, around the other...

17:06.723 --> 17:08.425
There you go.
No, no, it's OK, baby.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.730
No, not you. Hold on, I'm gonna
put you on hold for a second.

17:12.463 --> 17:14.098
Alright, you'll be fine.

17:14.731 --> 17:15.665
Frida!

17:16.768 --> 17:18.269
Can you keep an extra
close eye on him with Jamie?

17:19.304 --> 17:21.073
- Great, thank you.
- Here, here, here.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.310
It's OK, <i>mi amor.</i>

17:25.410 --> 17:26.577
Come, come, my love.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.079
Come, come.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.451
It's your beard. He's scared.

17:32.650 --> 17:33.752
Oh.

17:48.665 --> 17:50.568
Please, <i>senor,</i> not pick him up.

17:51.135 --> 17:52.237
I wasn't going to.

17:52.569 --> 17:54.138
Hi. Hi, my love!

17:54.506 --> 17:55.441
Hi, my love.

17:56.441 --> 17:57.576
Why shouldn't I pick him up?

17:58.343 --> 18:00.312
After all, he is my grandson.

18:00.678 --> 18:03.382
- He needs to work.
- Babies don't work.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.716
Emily says he's behind
his cross-crawl.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.086
He needs to practise.

18:07.885 --> 18:09.687
Come!

18:10.154 --> 18:11.856
He must learn how to be
autonomous.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.225
Och, nonsense!

18:13.724 --> 18:15.860
Good job!

18:16.827 --> 18:18.396
Emily did research.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.384
Och, come on, bairn.

18:40.652 --> 18:41.653
Man up!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.423
Man up!

18:47.592 --> 18:48.759
Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:10.682 --> 19:12.584
Only one way across
enemy territory!

19:16.587 --> 19:17.822
What are you doing?

19:22.259 --> 19:23.461
There you go.

19:24.328 --> 19:25.730
And how is your day today, sir?

19:26.564 --> 19:28.500
Give me the bloodiest thing
you've got.

19:37.442 --> 19:38.442
Mm.

19:46.550 --> 19:47.451
Mm.

19:50.288 --> 19:51.757
You want some, hm?

19:52.923 --> 19:54.960
Are you man enough?

19:55.059 --> 19:56.194
Mm.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.769
Ooh, yeah?

20:09.973 --> 20:11.777
Oh, he's a MacNeil alright!

20:36.334 --> 20:37.369
Dad?

20:37.969 --> 20:39.938
Dad, where have you been?

20:40.738 --> 20:42.374
I was out two hours
looking for you.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.609
- You had us worried sick.
- I took the boy for a stroll.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.578
What? You can't just pick him up
and leave, Dad.

20:47.711 --> 20:49.981
We had no way of contacting you.
You didn't even take any food.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.584
I fed him. You think I'd starve
my own grandson?

20:52.683 --> 20:53.684
You're not hungry?

20:54.951 --> 20:57.321
I thought Emily made it clear,
they were not to be left alone.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.757
Who's she to chaperone me?

20:58.923 --> 21:00.025
I'm his grandfather.

21:01.392 --> 21:02.794
You just wait
until Emily gets back.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.561
You better hope she doesn't
send you on the next flight

21:04.595 --> 21:05.529
back to Glasgow.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.635
If you've got something to say
to me, say it in English.

21:11.669 --> 21:12.971
How's about this for English?

21:13.403 --> 21:15.406
Get the hell out of here
while I have a piss!

21:16.907 --> 21:18.542
You have no idea
what he's been like.

21:18.875 --> 21:19.845
Alright, well...

21:20.979 --> 21:22.447
- let me handle it this time, OK?
- Good luck with that.

21:23.614 --> 21:25.750
God, he always shaves when
he wants to impress a woman.

21:25.782 --> 21:26.817
It's ridiculous.

21:27.852 --> 21:29.521
All ready for my scolding now.

21:31.055 --> 21:32.591
Why don't we have a seat?

21:34.858 --> 21:35.993
So, did you...

21:36.661 --> 21:39.030
- enjoy your afternoon with Jamie?
- Och!

21:39.430 --> 21:40.499
We had a ball.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.871
Well, you had us all a bit...

21:47.105 --> 21:48.373
- worried.
- Ah.

21:49.507 --> 21:51.476
But, I'd like to apologise.

21:51.942 --> 21:54.546
You must be overwhelmed

21:54.979 --> 21:57.548
exhausted, and uh...

21:57.648 --> 22:01.419
we have not been as attentive
as we should have been.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.355
- Right, Ian?
- What?

22:04.454 --> 22:05.456
You're joking.

22:07.858 --> 22:10.561
And I apologise for that and
hope that you're not offended.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.332
Not at all.

22:13.998 --> 22:15.433
Apology accepted.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.634
Good.

22:17.134 --> 22:18.036
Also...

22:19.436 --> 22:20.705
I have something for you

22:20.904 --> 22:22.773
to help us communicate better.

22:23.907 --> 22:24.842
Wow.

22:25.442 --> 22:26.345
Yeah.

22:27.044 --> 22:28.680
Actually, I've taken the liberty

22:28.712 --> 22:31.383
of including you
into Jamie's calendar.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.851
Hm.

22:35.653 --> 22:36.654
Great, that's...

22:37.555 --> 22:38.623
all settled then.

22:40.557 --> 22:41.992
I'm gonna go say goodnight
to Jamie.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.130
Uh, one thing
I couldn't help notice...

22:46.196 --> 22:47.865
the boy's got his own room.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.937
Why doesn't he sleep with you
like it's always been done?

22:52.603 --> 22:54.873
Well, what we've learned

22:55.205 --> 22:58.009
is that to develop
a healthy attachment

22:58.809 --> 22:59.977
babies need to learn

23:00.010 --> 23:01.546
- to become...
- Autonomous.

23:03.780 --> 23:04.750
Right.

23:06.517 --> 23:07.652
Autonomous.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.662
I can't take it anymore.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.765
- I'm going, I'm...
- Ian, please, just...

23:21.231 --> 23:22.433
let it go.

23:27.738 --> 23:28.740
See?

23:29.707 --> 23:30.876
By the book.

23:43.019 --> 23:44.189
Your <i>seanair</i> is here.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.026
Do you know what <i>seanair</i> means?

23:48.526 --> 23:51.596
Aye? That's Gaelic for Grandpa.

24:12.616 --> 24:14.251
Emily worked really hard
to get you in.

24:14.285 --> 24:16.822
It's an excellent hospital,
one of the best in the world.

24:16.988 --> 24:20.025
Ah? Americans, aye,
think they're the best.

24:20.758 --> 24:22.561
That's why they need
good hospitals.

24:22.993 --> 24:24.228
For all the shite they eat

24:24.328 --> 24:26.197
and all the filthy air
they breathe.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.098
Try not to say
anything like that

24:28.132 --> 24:29.667
at the gala this evening,
will you?

24:29.700 --> 24:30.669
It's the truth.

24:31.635 --> 24:32.537
Truth or not, they don't like it
when you say

24:32.569 --> 24:34.205
what you really think
about things here.

24:34.538 --> 24:36.941
Hm, if I said
what I really thought...

24:54.291 --> 24:55.592
And we're done.

24:59.663 --> 25:00.698
How bad is it?

25:00.730 --> 25:02.701
Well, we need to check your...

25:02.967 --> 25:06.705
scans and your samples,
so it'll take a few days

25:07.571 --> 25:08.839
but from what I've seen

25:09.574 --> 25:11.109
you've got the heart
of a 50-year-old.

25:13.210 --> 25:14.980
I wish Campbell were here
to hear that.

25:15.211 --> 25:17.648
- Who's Campbell, your son?
- No, worse.

25:40.971 --> 25:42.073
I couldn't believe it either!

25:42.105 --> 25:44.542
It was the funniest thing
that I've seen all year...

26:13.104 --> 26:14.873
Here we go. Cheers.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.709
What can I get for you
tonight, sir?

26:17.741 --> 26:19.810
We've got an array of molecular
specialities.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.680
We've got "Love in the Asylum"

26:21.779 --> 26:24.081
"Blood On The Tracks",
"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes".

26:25.249 --> 26:28.752
Just give me something that will
burn my throat as it goes down.

26:29.987 --> 26:30.956
OK.

26:38.895 --> 26:40.097
Decadence.

26:40.364 --> 26:42.067
Interchangeability.

26:42.298 --> 26:43.835
It bores me, to be honest.

26:45.001 --> 26:48.373
All that mystery when I was
growing up, just gone.

26:49.707 --> 26:51.676
Nothing left to wonder at
these days.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.379
Is it like that
where you're from too?

26:56.681 --> 26:57.848
Where I come from...

26:58.348 --> 26:59.350
a woman is a woman

26:59.817 --> 27:01.185
and she doesn't need
to prove it.

27:01.951 --> 27:03.387
Here you go, sir.

27:04.121 --> 27:05.156
<i>Slàinte!</i>

27:06.057 --> 27:07.158
Same to you.

27:12.997 --> 27:14.132
What the hell is this?

27:14.298 --> 27:15.767
"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"

27:15.799 --> 27:17.635
it'll give you that burn
you're looking for.

27:17.835 --> 27:20.071
Smoke gets in my bollocks
is more like it.

27:21.838 --> 27:23.173
I had a feeling I'd like you.

27:24.141 --> 27:25.176
- You did?
- I did.

27:27.243 --> 27:28.679
- Dad.
- Hey, honey!

27:28.779 --> 27:29.614
God, you look great.

27:29.646 --> 27:31.415
Thank you.
Are you being impossible?

27:31.516 --> 27:32.683
No!

27:33.550 --> 27:35.052
How did you two
find each other here?

27:36.386 --> 27:37.955
Process of elimination.

27:38.255 --> 27:40.892
It's called a clan tartan
or something, isn't it?

27:41.224 --> 27:43.827
Oh, aye, these colours
have been in the family

27:43.928 --> 27:46.398
for, oh, well over 200 years.

27:46.730 --> 27:49.433
It's beautiful. It's just what
we need to spice up this event.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.036
Good for you.

27:52.836 --> 27:55.205
You know, you two should really
try Ian's food.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.008
It's really exciting.

27:59.442 --> 28:00.345
Um, anyway.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.080
Um, I will check on you two
in a bit.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.949
- OK. Knock 'em dead.
- Thanks.

28:10.421 --> 28:12.123
What we wouldn't do for them,
eh, Rory?

28:13.958 --> 28:14.959
Who?

28:15.326 --> 28:16.326
Our children.

28:17.361 --> 28:18.730
Oh, aye, aye, aye.

28:18.962 --> 28:20.097
Probably, aye.

28:31.107 --> 28:32.242
Are you ready to come up?

28:33.277 --> 28:35.880
It never turns out exactly
how I pictured it in my mind.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.289
Hey.

28:46.856 --> 28:47.925
Seriously.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.127
I am so proud of you.

28:51.261 --> 28:53.097
I mean, just look at everything.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.033
It's just you and your vision.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.434
Enjoy it, Ian.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.906
Even your dad now knows
what a brilliant chef you are.

29:03.339 --> 29:04.375
My dad?

29:06.242 --> 29:07.479
Is that what he said?

29:08.813 --> 29:10.215
Why don't you come
ask him yourself?

29:10.847 --> 29:12.817
This stuff is celestial.

29:12.916 --> 29:13.817
Oh!

29:14.919 --> 29:17.522
And this from one of
San Francisco's famous foodies!

29:17.954 --> 29:18.923
I'm impressed.

29:20.023 --> 29:21.859
Mm... oh!

29:22.358 --> 29:23.427
That's surprising.

29:23.993 --> 29:25.028
I thought it was an egg.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.165
Well, that's molecular for you.

29:28.531 --> 29:31.034
My son, he makes these?

29:31.134 --> 29:33.504
Well, he does now.
Watch and learn.

29:35.239 --> 29:36.406
Oh, God, oh!

29:36.507 --> 29:37.442
Are you OK?

29:39.143 --> 29:41.179
Look who I managed to drag
out of the kitchen.

29:41.278 --> 29:44.481
Oh! Stunning job, Ian.
We're all very, very impressed.

29:45.449 --> 29:47.185
The tux pants not your size,
Dad?

29:47.285 --> 29:50.188
Oh, a man in a kilt
is a man and a half, laddie.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.321
And you should know that.

29:51.422 --> 29:54.225
Listen, everybody,
I would actually like to propose

29:54.258 --> 29:55.360
a toast.

29:56.393 --> 29:57.560
I just wanna say that

29:57.594 --> 30:00.097
it's such a privilege to be
standing here at this event

30:00.198 --> 30:02.333
that was so tastefully
and elegantly prepared

30:02.365 --> 30:03.500
by my very own daughter.

30:03.901 --> 30:05.403
- Dad, you don't have to...
- No, honey.

30:05.502 --> 30:07.070
Let me blow your horn
for a minute, OK?

30:07.104 --> 30:09.106
You're always
plugging everybody else.

30:10.106 --> 30:10.974
Your mum.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.478
if she could see how you've
grown up...

30:15.045 --> 30:19.050
And to my son-in-law, Ian.
I just want to say that, uh...

30:19.282 --> 30:21.019
we're all flabbergasted
at your...

30:22.086 --> 30:24.989
bold and unexpected
metamorphosis

30:25.088 --> 30:26.490
from chemist to cook.

30:27.924 --> 30:30.561
So, no more of that
sous-chef bullshit.

30:31.295 --> 30:33.998
From now on, Ian is going to be
wearing the chef's hat

30:34.431 --> 30:35.967
in his very own restaurant.

30:36.432 --> 30:38.236
I made the first down payment
this morning.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.138
- You didn't!
- I did!

30:41.137 --> 30:42.105
Cheers.

30:43.373 --> 30:46.544
I've set up a meeting for you
with a guy named Jeff Stradlow.

30:46.644 --> 30:47.912
He's the best there is.

30:48.913 --> 30:49.947
He's gonna handle the
business end of things.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.884
All you have to do is walk in
and do your thing.

30:53.683 --> 30:55.952
That is just so surprising.

30:55.986 --> 30:58.156
I mean, we had no idea!

30:59.088 --> 31:00.057
It's really exciting.

31:00.991 --> 31:03.126
Oh, wow, yeah.
I don't know what to say.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.996
- No worries.
- I think he means

31:05.028 --> 31:06.064
to say thank you.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.434
Of course, sorry.
Thank you, thank you so much.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.870
Come on. Here, give us a hug.
Come on!

31:12.169 --> 31:13.338
Come on! Partners.

31:13.604 --> 31:15.273
Here we go, that's my boy.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.308
Hey, Dad, next time you come

31:18.342 --> 31:20.144
you'll be a guest
at my own restaurant.

31:34.657 --> 31:36.126
What'd he just say?

31:37.661 --> 31:39.998
I'm not sure,
my Gaelic's a bit rusty.

31:40.364 --> 31:41.900
I've gotta get back
to the kitchen.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.032
Well, I saw something
very similar in New York.

32:15.265 --> 32:16.501
Is that where you're from?

32:16.601 --> 32:17.936
It is, originally...

32:18.368 --> 32:19.303
Oh!

32:19.769 --> 32:21.306
Don't touch it please, sir.

32:22.006 --> 32:24.275
Oh, I'm sorry.
I never meant any harm...

32:24.307 --> 32:25.442
Woah, please.

32:26.676 --> 32:29.646
Terracotta is
a very sensitive material.

32:30.713 --> 32:32.517
It's a miracle
they survived at all.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.485
That smile, huh?

32:37.020 --> 32:39.456
They look as if they're having
a right ball, those two.

32:40.156 --> 32:41.391
It's a burial tomb.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.362
This is how the Etruscans
pictured their dead.

32:45.229 --> 32:47.465
- They don't look dead to me.
- Why?

32:48.198 --> 32:49.500
You can't die with a smile?

32:52.635 --> 32:55.306
I don't think I've ever had
a conversation with a man...

32:55.571 --> 32:57.074
in a kilt, before.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.442
Ah...

32:59.477 --> 33:01.546
Doesn't go down big
in San Francisco, I think.

33:01.711 --> 33:04.248
No, it's... it's a great look.

33:05.214 --> 33:06.384
So is yours.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.686
Better than those ladies
back there.

33:09.252 --> 33:12.490
Huge fake tits to go with
their huge fake smiles.

33:13.089 --> 33:14.224
If you know what I mean.

33:17.227 --> 33:18.363
Do you come here often?

33:19.195 --> 33:20.230
I work here.

33:21.330 --> 33:22.532
Well, maybe I'll come again.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.168
- In the daytime.
- You should.

33:26.269 --> 33:27.504
We have guided tours.

33:28.305 --> 33:29.273
Goodnight.

33:29.506 --> 33:30.541
Goodnight.

33:31.808 --> 33:33.110
Don't touch.

33:34.344 --> 33:35.346
I won't.

34:06.844 --> 34:08.478
This is one of the world's

34:08.512 --> 34:10.280
three great natural harbours

34:10.581 --> 34:12.083
right in the heart of downtown.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.418
Over there, you can see
Treasure Island.

34:15.119 --> 34:17.121
It was a military base
until 2008

34:17.221 --> 34:19.157
when they finally started
letting civilians...

35:42.672 --> 35:44.141
Are you Ian MacNeil?

35:44.507 --> 35:46.576
- Yes.
- Is this your father?

35:47.277 --> 35:48.378
What did he do?

35:49.846 --> 35:51.581
Armed robbery.

35:52.481 --> 35:54.585
I understand
he's not from around here

35:54.784 --> 35:56.253
so I'm gonna let this one slide.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.255
Be sure to tell your father

35:58.289 --> 36:00.892
that we don't allow nude
swimming in public spaces.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.628
Thank you, officer.
We appreciate that.

36:03.728 --> 36:04.729
You have a good night.

36:05.596 --> 36:06.563
Thank you, officer.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.465
It was lovely to spend
the evening with you.

36:08.498 --> 36:09.634
Pleasure meeting you, sir.

36:14.605 --> 36:15.840
A very nice man.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.684
Telephone for you, <i>senor.</i>

36:30.454 --> 36:31.389
For me?

36:31.722 --> 36:32.623
<i>Si.</i>

36:32.922 --> 36:33.890
Who could it be?

36:35.891 --> 36:37.394
Who even knows I'm here...?

36:38.394 --> 36:39.396
Hello?

36:43.333 --> 36:45.336
Fraser, you old sod!

36:47.871 --> 36:48.838
You don't say.

36:50.974 --> 36:51.876
Frida!

36:52.876 --> 36:53.811
Campbell.

36:54.543 --> 36:55.579
Liver failure!

36:56.679 --> 36:58.215
Oh, good news!

37:00.418 --> 37:02.887
Oh, he's dying, he's dying,
he's dying!

37:04.588 --> 37:07.258
Yes, yes, yes!
He's going to die first, laddie!

37:07.923 --> 37:10.393
And then I'm going back
to Vallasay

37:10.726 --> 37:12.262
and you're gonna come with me.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.965
You'll taste the liquor
and the meat

37:15.364 --> 37:16.533
of real men!

37:25.809 --> 37:26.711
Mm.

37:27.643 --> 37:29.879
Tonight, we celebrate.

37:34.583 --> 37:35.619
Is that Mum's stew?

37:35.818 --> 37:36.954
My stew.

37:38.021 --> 37:40.358
Don't you remember?
I always used to cook it up

37:40.690 --> 37:41.992
on special occasions.

37:42.592 --> 37:43.760
- It was you?
- Aye.

37:51.568 --> 37:52.536
Wow!

37:53.336 --> 37:54.371
What's all this?

37:54.838 --> 37:56.641
Dad's cooked
a celebratory dinner.

37:59.742 --> 38:00.878
Sit down...

38:01.744 --> 38:02.746
and dig in.

38:05.548 --> 38:06.483
It's hot.

38:09.652 --> 38:11.388
See? He's coming around.

38:12.121 --> 38:13.790
You should try it,
it's Dad's recipe.

38:16.525 --> 38:17.560
This is delicious.

38:17.728 --> 38:18.695
Ah.

38:21.998 --> 38:23.067
I know that knife.

38:24.168 --> 38:26.737
It was supposed to be yours
but you didn't want it.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.806
It's not that I didn't want it.
I was just too young.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.807
Too feared.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.846
Well, I'm old enough now.

38:36.579 --> 38:37.882
This belongs to Jamie.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.483
I'm gonna hold it
till he's older.

38:42.918 --> 38:44.654
That is delicious.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.590
Then you'll love
the blood sausage.

38:47.023 --> 38:49.794
It's no black pudding,
but it's the closest thing

38:49.893 --> 38:50.960
- to...
- Uh, don't bother.

38:51.061 --> 38:52.396
Even I can't stand
black pudding.

38:52.429 --> 38:53.530
Oh, come on!

38:54.398 --> 38:55.298
You used to love it when you

38:55.333 --> 38:56.934
- were a bairn.
- Dad, I don't like it...

38:57.099 --> 38:59.336
Come on, come on.
Come on, son!

38:59.503 --> 39:01.405
Celebrate with me, hm?

39:03.472 --> 39:05.041
I've never felt better
in my life.

39:05.942 --> 39:08.579
I reckon, no more doctors.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.649
What are you talking about?

39:13.483 --> 39:15.619
The old prick is gonna
die first.

39:20.956 --> 39:22.393
- Campbell?
- Ha, ha!

39:23.092 --> 39:25.528
Yes. Got the news this morning.

39:26.163 --> 39:27.530
From Fraser.

39:28.664 --> 39:30.400
So we owe this visit of yours...

39:30.934 --> 39:32.536
- to Campbell?
- Uh-huh.

39:33.503 --> 39:34.739
Wait, who's Campbell?

39:35.204 --> 39:36.507
What is it this time?

39:37.139 --> 39:38.808
Which one of you
kicks the bucket first?

39:40.643 --> 39:41.611
Oh.

39:43.045 --> 39:44.547
You'll never change, Dad.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.915
Mum was right.

39:47.150 --> 39:49.052
If it was up to you, nothing
in this world would ever change.

39:50.719 --> 39:51.888
Change? What for?

39:53.556 --> 39:56.092
By the way, we're celebrating
a dying man.

39:57.626 --> 40:00.096
Well, I was hoping
that we were...

40:00.896 --> 40:02.465
celebrating your restaurant.

40:03.099 --> 40:04.101
So did I.

40:04.134 --> 40:06.036
Stupidly. But no, all of this...

40:06.503 --> 40:09.140
this is for Alasdair Campbell
who's now apparently dying.

40:09.239 --> 40:11.508
- Hallelujah.
- According to my dad

40:11.807 --> 40:14.711
he's devoted his entire life
to this very moment.

40:15.811 --> 40:17.147
It was your dog he poisoned.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.949
No one knows that for sure, Dad!

40:19.081 --> 40:20.116
Shh! Jamie.

40:20.650 --> 40:22.052
You wanna know something
about my dad?

40:23.018 --> 40:25.722
When we found my dog, Angus,
dead in the yard

40:25.822 --> 40:28.057
I wanted to bury the poor fellow
like he deserved.

40:28.090 --> 40:29.692
But no, you thought otherwise,
didn't you?

40:29.726 --> 40:30.994
No, you let him rot!

40:31.094 --> 40:33.062
And then he carried
his decayed carcass

40:33.163 --> 40:34.664
and put it on
Campbell's doorstep.

40:38.869 --> 40:39.903
Why would you do that?

40:41.005 --> 40:42.472
That's how it works in Vallasay,
it's called a feud.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.173
Don't blame me.

40:44.206 --> 40:46.476
- I didn't start it.
- Oh, of course not.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.678
Nothing to do with you!

40:47.844 --> 40:49.447
No say in the matter whatsoever!

40:49.913 --> 40:52.115
You're just an innocent heir
to a rivalry

40:52.215 --> 40:54.250
which no MacNeil or Campbell
has been able to settle

40:54.284 --> 40:57.119
since 1764,
when Muriall MacNeil

40:57.152 --> 40:59.155
broke off her engagement
to Lachlan Campbell!

40:59.856 --> 41:01.892
Legend has it,
Muriall got a sneak peak

41:01.992 --> 41:04.161
under Campbell's kilt
and didn't like what she saw.

41:04.527 --> 41:05.962
So then the Campbells went
and castrated

41:05.996 --> 41:07.798
all of the MacNeil cattle.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.867
Of course, the MacNeils couldn't
let that go unpunished

41:09.900 --> 41:12.102
could they? Etc, etc, etc...

41:12.202 --> 41:14.672
Well, I'm glad you remember it
after all these years.

41:14.971 --> 41:17.907
He always had better things
to do than to help his old dad.

41:18.007 --> 41:19.809
All you ever did
was take the piss out of me

41:19.842 --> 41:21.711
- and call me "a little coward"!
- Then!

41:21.744 --> 41:23.813
Then, he upped sticks
and left Vallasay.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.182
Thought it was beneath him.

41:25.815 --> 41:27.818
I didn't run away, Dad!

41:28.585 --> 41:31.121
I got a scholarship to Berkley!

41:31.153 --> 41:32.054
What was I supposed to do?

41:32.088 --> 41:34.625
Spend my life playing
your bloody games?

41:36.360 --> 41:37.728
It wasn't the scholarship.

41:38.094 --> 41:39.829
That wasn't why
you left Vallasay.

41:41.797 --> 41:42.866
You're right, Dad.

41:43.967 --> 41:45.769
It wasn't Vallasay that I left.

41:47.570 --> 41:48.605
It was you.

41:49.105 --> 41:51.275
Aye. You did.

41:51.641 --> 41:52.710
And now...

41:53.009 --> 41:56.045
Now you're one of them.
Spoilt rotten.

41:57.079 --> 41:58.882
You teach your son
to be autonomous!

41:59.815 --> 42:02.185
But you're still a bairn

42:02.786 --> 42:04.554
playing with your chemistry set.

42:05.688 --> 42:06.757
And it's too late!

42:07.190 --> 42:09.659
Too late to teach you
how to be a man!

42:48.797 --> 42:51.233
It's the blind leading
the fucking blind around here

42:51.266 --> 42:52.168
my boy.

42:52.936 --> 42:53.903
To them...

42:54.838 --> 42:57.207
the stars are invisible
in San Francisco.

42:58.942 --> 43:01.177
Lucky, you have me around

43:02.646 --> 43:03.781
to guide you.

43:22.231 --> 43:25.768
Oh, you've never seen a sky
more beautiful

43:25.902 --> 43:27.371
than the one in Vallasay.

43:28.972 --> 43:31.075
The old prick is enjoying it
right now

43:31.175 --> 43:32.977
but he'll be gone soon enough

43:33.842 --> 43:35.045
and then, my boy...

43:35.911 --> 43:37.747
Then it'll be you and I

43:37.914 --> 43:40.918
gazing at the stars together.

43:58.333 --> 44:01.804
Generally speaking,
you are in excellent condition

44:01.905 --> 44:04.742
for your age,
except of course...

44:05.340 --> 44:06.710
what brings you here.

44:07.277 --> 44:09.112
There is no easy way
to say this.

44:09.913 --> 44:12.750
Your PET and CT scans confirm

44:12.849 --> 44:15.786
that you have stage four
prostate cancer.

44:20.289 --> 44:22.259
And how many stages are there?

44:22.992 --> 44:23.894
Four.

44:26.295 --> 44:30.701
The appropriate medical term is
"metastasised" prostate cancer.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.170
At this stage,
chemotherapy is not recommended

44:34.204 --> 44:36.406
or effective...

44:36.438 --> 44:37.306
And in these cases...

44:38.775 --> 44:41.412
we prescribe oxycodone
for the bone pain

44:42.144 --> 44:43.880
as well as hormonal treatments.

44:45.748 --> 44:47.150
We need to get shots
once a week.

44:49.853 --> 44:52.289
Now, sir, do you understand
what I have just said?

44:53.255 --> 44:54.324
How long do I have?

44:56.391 --> 44:57.492
That is so hard to say

44:57.527 --> 44:59.963
and I'm reluctant to give
these kinds of estimations

44:59.996 --> 45:01.764
since they tend to be
a calculated guess

45:01.864 --> 45:02.865
- at best...
- Guess then.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.768
I would rather not.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.704
A week, months, a year?

45:09.972 --> 45:11.741
- Less than a year?
- Sir, please.

45:11.775 --> 45:13.911
There are so many variables
to factor, as I said

45:14.010 --> 45:15.778
you are in excellent
physical condition.

45:15.878 --> 45:17.714
Why don't you just give me
a bloody number?

45:20.182 --> 45:22.318
- OK, um... thank you, Doctor.
- No, wait.

45:23.519 --> 45:24.788
I haven't finished yet.

45:26.389 --> 45:27.724
Can I ask you a question?

45:28.090 --> 45:29.226
Yes, yes, of course.

45:30.427 --> 45:32.863
How long does it take to die
from cirrhosis of the liver?

45:33.563 --> 45:36.400
Someone my age
had it about five years.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.835
Can't walk without a cane.

45:38.168 --> 45:40.237
Yellow in the face
for the past few months.

45:41.471 --> 45:43.206
They say he might have
liver failure.

45:44.106 --> 45:46.210
Sir, do you expect me to answer
this seriously?

45:47.210 --> 45:49.480
Hm. Just what I thought.

45:50.813 --> 45:52.248
You're good for nothing.

45:55.451 --> 45:57.855
There we go, oh, ah! Oh!

45:59.822 --> 46:01.491
What did you do?

46:03.927 --> 46:04.995
What the hell
are you talking about?

46:06.061 --> 46:06.730
I got a message from Emily
to come home immediately

46:06.762 --> 46:08.431
so I had to leave service again.

46:08.532 --> 46:10.033
It's like being in
<i>Groundhog Day.</i>

46:10.065 --> 46:12.201
Oh, it's not my fault
that doctor's an idiot.

46:13.202 --> 46:14.804
You went to the doctor
again today?

46:14.838 --> 46:16.373
Yeah, got cancer, stage four.

46:16.905 --> 46:18.442
Eh, whatever the hell
that means.

46:21.311 --> 46:22.813
What did he say? W-what...

46:22.913 --> 46:25.014
- exactly did he say?
- He didn't say anything!

46:25.481 --> 46:28.018
That hack couldn't make
a clear sentence

46:28.150 --> 46:29.519
if his life depended upon it.

46:30.085 --> 46:31.487
But he used the word "cancer".

46:32.155 --> 46:33.157
- Yeah.
- Dad!

46:33.257 --> 46:35.192
Oh, I'm fine, Ian.

46:35.425 --> 46:36.794
Don't fuss over me.

46:37.492 --> 46:39.429
We've got to have our super-fun
time together.

46:39.929 --> 46:41.831
Haven't we, Jamie?
We've got plans!

46:42.532 --> 46:45.369
Yeah, haven't we Jamie, boy? Eh?

47:12.327 --> 47:14.230
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Are you OK?

47:14.331 --> 47:15.599
Will you watch
where you're going?

47:22.105 --> 47:23.273
Stop!

47:26.442 --> 47:27.476
Stop!

47:40.322 --> 47:41.391
Are you alright?

47:47.063 --> 47:49.266
Jamie... Christ!

47:50.065 --> 47:53.402
Stupid, stupid, stupid old man!

48:01.010 --> 48:01.912
Oh, my...

48:04.280 --> 48:05.615
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

48:06.114 --> 48:08.017
That's, that's my grandson.

48:08.318 --> 48:09.953
- Oh, it's you!
- Uh-huh!

48:10.085 --> 48:12.321
Are you crazy,
leaving a baby alone like this?

48:12.355 --> 48:13.990
I lost my head, I got, I got...

48:14.257 --> 48:16.425
I got pickpocketed
like some pathetic tourist.

48:16.659 --> 48:19.363
So you left your grandson
to chase after your wallet?

48:19.996 --> 48:21.530
You're lucky I'm the one
that found him.

48:21.563 --> 48:23.332
What would I have done?
I-I...

48:23.498 --> 48:24.901
I'm new to all this.

48:25.367 --> 48:27.270
Oh look, I think he likes you,
you know.

48:27.371 --> 48:28.438
He's beginning to play.

48:28.538 --> 48:29.704
- You can have him back now.
- Uh-huh.

48:30.440 --> 48:34.043
There we are. Oh, it's good to
have you safe and sound, eh?

48:34.210 --> 48:36.346
Safe and sound,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

48:36.713 --> 48:37.915
Oh, you're leaving?

48:39.181 --> 48:41.684
Yes, babysitting hours are up
and I've got actual work to do.

48:42.184 --> 48:43.452
But we've come all this way!

48:43.585 --> 48:45.288
And you promised us
a guided tour.

48:45.621 --> 48:47.557
Uh... Claudia.

48:47.657 --> 48:51.094
Uh, Rory MacNeil, by the way
and this here is Jamie MacNeil.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.130
Yes, well, guided tours
are in the morning, sir

48:54.231 --> 48:57.167
and, um, I'm not a guide.

49:00.268 --> 49:02.271
Mm... come on, laddie.

49:03.072 --> 49:05.409
I think we've got
some actual work to do.

49:05.708 --> 49:06.677
Hm?

49:23.693 --> 49:26.129
Why do they make them
so damn ugly?

49:28.297 --> 49:29.432
Wait a minute, are you...

49:30.166 --> 49:31.468
really interested, or are...

49:31.666 --> 49:33.069
you just messing with me?

49:34.570 --> 49:36.039
Course I'm interested.

49:39.742 --> 49:42.379
Well, the Romans considered it
a sign of character

49:42.411 --> 49:45.214
not to camouflage
your blemishes.

49:45.380 --> 49:47.583
Your scars and your wrinkles

49:48.384 --> 49:50.253
were your badge of experience.

49:51.286 --> 49:52.221
You don't say.

49:54.222 --> 49:55.157
Oh.

50:06.635 --> 50:07.637
Mr MacNeil?

50:08.204 --> 50:09.139
Are you OK?

50:10.639 --> 50:12.308
I think I'm having a wee turn.

50:14.610 --> 50:16.747
- Shall we call the paramedics?
- I dunno.

50:17.612 --> 50:19.448
Are you feeling alright, Rory?

50:20.516 --> 50:21.518
Are you OK, sir?

50:25.153 --> 50:27.490
- What? What?
- I think he's speaking Gaelic.

50:30.226 --> 50:32.229
Has this ever happened
to you before?

50:33.128 --> 50:34.197
What can I say?

50:35.264 --> 50:37.666
I must have overdone it
on the whiskey last night.

50:38.333 --> 50:40.503
Ahem. Er, if you don't mind
my asking...

50:41.603 --> 50:43.205
was that Gaelic
you were speaking?

50:43.505 --> 50:44.574
Aye, what's it to you?

50:45.141 --> 50:47.744
I've been taking part in a study
over at the university

50:47.844 --> 50:49.546
about endangered languages.

50:50.746 --> 50:52.516
They would just love you
over there.

50:53.483 --> 50:54.551
And they would pay you,
of course.

50:54.583 --> 50:55.585
Don't need the money.

50:55.885 --> 50:57.454
It's not really about the money.

50:58.788 --> 51:00.423
It's for future generations.

51:02.492 --> 51:03.527
I'll do it...

51:04.327 --> 51:05.128
if you come.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.299
What, are you asking me
out on a date?

51:10.400 --> 51:12.802
Oh, no, no, not at all.
It's not a date.

51:13.369 --> 51:14.538
Did you not hear the man?

51:15.605 --> 51:17.273
It's for future generations.

51:18.206 --> 51:20.076
Isn't that right, Jamie? Hm?

51:34.590 --> 51:36.326
You don't know
what it feels like yet...

51:37.260 --> 51:38.361
to love a woman.

51:39.762 --> 51:41.865
But some day, Jamie...

51:43.365 --> 51:44.333
Some day.

51:48.838 --> 51:51.675
Och, it's not time to die!

51:52.407 --> 51:53.375
You know?

51:54.342 --> 51:57.746
When your stars are aligned
in your favour.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.355
Ah...

52:06.655 --> 52:07.690
He was coughing.

52:09.257 --> 52:10.693
I just popped in to check.

52:11.393 --> 52:12.628
Yeah, me too.

52:14.530 --> 52:15.432
Right.

52:19.702 --> 52:20.770
Goodnight, then.

52:24.974 --> 52:25.876
Goodnight, Dad.

52:32.380 --> 52:34.650
There might be
some pain and nausea

52:34.751 --> 52:36.653
during these days of treatments

52:37.286 --> 52:38.621
so don't be afraid
to let us know.

52:39.655 --> 52:40.657
Afraid?

52:41.489 --> 52:42.525
Of pain?

52:45.293 --> 52:47.230
Oh, there's a lot you don't know
about Scotsmen.

52:48.797 --> 52:50.866
I suggest you go home now
and take a good rest.

53:02.244 --> 53:03.246
Dad?

53:03.945 --> 53:05.548
Dad? Hey!

53:06.849 --> 53:07.850
What're you doing here?

53:07.882 --> 53:09.251
I thought I'd come and get you.

53:10.286 --> 53:12.422
You asked me to ring
if I needed anything.

53:12.521 --> 53:13.889
Well, how can you do that
without this?

53:15.257 --> 53:16.192
I'm fine.

53:17.193 --> 53:18.228
Come on, Dad, get in.
You must be exhausted.

53:19.094 --> 53:20.730
I do have plans of my own,
you know?

53:31.407 --> 53:32.943
Rory, basically it's very simple

53:33.541 --> 53:35.211
we need you to speak in Gaelic

53:35.311 --> 53:36.880
the way you speak
in everyday life.

53:37.545 --> 53:39.348
It's important that you don't
try to speak

53:39.449 --> 53:40.717
perfect textbook Gaelic

53:41.918 --> 53:44.354
because we're really interested
in your specific dialect.

53:44.619 --> 53:45.955
of Hebridean Gaelic.

53:46.822 --> 53:49.291
So, what do you want me to say?

53:50.626 --> 53:52.729
Well, say anything, uh...

53:53.795 --> 53:55.931
Pretend like you're on a date
with a beautiful woman.

53:58.534 --> 53:59.536
Well...

54:40.809 --> 54:44.847
Well, I did get the part about
you loving the woman's breasts

54:45.414 --> 54:46.983
and your being, uh...

54:47.583 --> 54:48.885
a demon in bed?

54:49.851 --> 54:50.853
A devil.

54:51.454 --> 54:52.455
Yeah.

54:55.657 --> 54:59.362
<i>Diongmhalt.</i> I had trouble
understanding that in context.

54:59.795 --> 55:02.298
Were you saying that people
could always

55:02.398 --> 55:04.067
count on you to be stubborn?

55:04.400 --> 55:06.336
That's not what it means at all.

55:07.402 --> 55:11.040
<i>Diongmhalt</i> is holding
the line of battle

55:11.673 --> 55:12.708
no matter what.

55:13.041 --> 55:15.711
Ah, so it's more
about commitment.

55:18.681 --> 55:20.349
English have words
for all kinds of shite

55:21.416 --> 55:23.452
but they never have words
for what really matters.

55:24.686 --> 55:26.955
<i>Diongmhalt</i> is <i>diongmhalt.</i>

55:28.090 --> 55:29.358
<i>Diongmhalt!</i>

55:29.925 --> 55:31.061
Am I saying it right?

55:31.927 --> 55:33.596
- Yes.
- <i>Diongmhalt.</i>

55:35.097 --> 55:36.466
This is great stuff.

55:37.733 --> 55:39.769
Whit's fur ye will no go by ye.

55:39.902 --> 55:41.070
Whit's fur ye'll...

55:42.137 --> 55:45.474
Whit's fur ye'll no go by ye...

55:45.574 --> 55:48.010
It mean, what's meant to happen
to you, will happen.

55:48.978 --> 55:51.447
Whit's fur ye'll no go by ye...

55:51.646 --> 55:54.416
Oh, we'll have you talking
like a real Scotswoman.

55:54.617 --> 55:56.086
Hell, you should come
to Vallasay.

55:56.518 --> 55:58.487
- You'd fool them all.
- Hm...

55:59.755 --> 56:01.891
What would a woman like me
do in a place like that?

56:01.923 --> 56:02.992
I don't know, I...

56:03.793 --> 56:05.028
I am such a city girl.

56:05.728 --> 56:08.063
Oh, there's lots of fun things
to do in Vallasay.

56:08.197 --> 56:09.499
Oh, yeah? Like what?

56:10.565 --> 56:11.701
Och, well...

56:13.735 --> 56:15.704
I go for a swim

56:16.204 --> 56:17.973
outside my house every morning.

56:18.773 --> 56:20.676
Och, you should see the water.

56:21.811 --> 56:24.814
So crisp and sparkling.

56:25.981 --> 56:28.518
When I come out,
I'm as alert as a tiger

56:28.550 --> 56:29.786
nothing can get by me.

56:30.186 --> 56:31.988
At night time, I go to the pub

56:32.521 --> 56:34.824
and have a few pints
and a laugh with my mates.

56:34.923 --> 56:36.559
Well, it sounds pretty idyllic.

56:41.797 --> 56:42.731
What?

56:43.699 --> 56:44.666
Nothing.

56:47.603 --> 56:49.405
You know there's an ocean
here too, Rory.

56:50.505 --> 56:52.608
And San Francisco
is a beautiful city

56:52.740 --> 56:53.943
if you give it a chance.

56:56.077 --> 56:57.146
Maybe I would...

56:58.313 --> 57:01.617
if I had a beautiful woman
like you to show me around.

58:03.012 --> 58:04.814
- <i>Si, senora?</i>
- On the diapers...

58:04.980 --> 58:06.815
The fours are a little bit snug
on him now

58:06.916 --> 58:08.885
so you're gonna wanna pick up
some of the fives.

58:08.918 --> 58:10.952
- <i>Si, senora.</i>
- Now is a good time

58:10.985 --> 58:11.987
- to jumpstart...
- You see?

58:12.153 --> 58:13.054
...his language skills.

58:13.088 --> 58:15.491
With a little practice,
it works.

58:15.623 --> 58:17.159
Right.
But remember, no baby talk.

58:17.260 --> 58:19.662
- <i>Si, senora.</i>
- You want to keep it narrative.

58:19.762 --> 58:22.097
Things like, "Oh, now I'm
chopping vegetables

58:22.197 --> 58:24.500
for the soup," or
"Now I'm filling out my online

58:24.601 --> 58:26.068
- registration form."
- <i>Si, senora.</i>

58:26.168 --> 58:27.636
Bag? Where is my bag?

58:27.802 --> 58:29.137
- I'll get it.
- Great.

58:31.039 --> 58:32.708
Who's this?

58:32.740 --> 58:33.976
- Who's this?
- Jamie, honey.

58:35.311 --> 58:37.247
Jamie, honey,
Mummy has to go on a work trip

58:37.347 --> 58:38.982
for just a couple days.

58:39.081 --> 58:40.782
OK?

58:40.916 --> 58:43.219
You gonna be good for Frida
and good for Grandpa?

58:44.286 --> 58:45.655
Si...

58:46.755 --> 58:49.559
He said, "Yes"!

58:49.958 --> 58:51.994
Yes! You said, "Yes".

58:55.797 --> 58:57.199
Oh, honey.

58:57.766 --> 58:58.668
Oh...

58:59.902 --> 59:02.639
I'm sorry I gotta go to work
just as you're learning to talk.

59:03.371 --> 59:05.908
You don't say another word
till Mummy gets back, OK?

59:06.775 --> 59:08.912
Gotta go now, I'm sorry.

59:12.681 --> 59:13.916
I'll see you in a few days,
Rory.

59:17.853 --> 59:19.856
Keep going, mm...

59:20.789 --> 59:22.258
Say <i>"Seanair."</i>

59:23.324 --> 59:24.226
<i>Seanair.</i>

59:25.161 --> 59:28.063
The day you say it,
you'll give me life.

59:29.297 --> 59:31.033
<i>Seanair.</i>

59:47.349 --> 59:48.251
Rory!

59:49.217 --> 59:50.953
I'm just finishing up,
I'll be right down.

59:53.989 --> 59:55.224
You're from North Korea, huh?

59:56.458 --> 59:58.226
I once asked my friend from
North Korea what it was like.

59:58.260 --> 59:59.862
He said, "I can't complain".

01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:08.770
- What's your name, sir?
- Rory.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.672
What's with the accent?

01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:12.141
Are you a Scotsman?

01:00:12.306 --> 01:00:13.642
Aye, and a proud one.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.652
Brief history of Scotland,
pre-historic sheep, baa!

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.388
What about the kilts?

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.757
They won't hear the zippers
when we sneak up on 'em!

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.795
- How'd I do?
- Oh, not bad.

01:00:33.362 --> 01:00:35.264
That's what I love
about the Scottish people.

01:00:35.764 --> 01:00:37.934
They're so drunk,
they'll laugh at everything.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.304
If I was drunk, I'd be coming
up there and joining you.

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:43.940
So what brought you out
from that rock

01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:46.041
in the middle of the Atlantic
to here?

01:00:46.074 --> 01:00:48.009
Are you here to steal our women?

01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:51.280
Are you here to roger
a few bonnie lasses?

01:00:53.748 --> 01:00:55.150
Stage four cancer.

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.739
When did you know?

01:01:17.438 --> 01:01:19.141
Uh, for a while.

01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:21.411
Just...

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:23.312
after I met you.

01:01:24.246 --> 01:01:25.381
Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:26.347 --> 01:01:28.250
Well, I'd understand
why you wouldn't

01:01:28.282 --> 01:01:30.786
want to be with a dying man.

01:01:32.019 --> 01:01:34.423
Well, that's not the point.
I just wish you felt that you...

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:36.325
could be open with me.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.363
But it's nothing to do with you.

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:45.902
Did you know
that Jamie started talking?

01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:49.271
That's great.

01:01:49.304 --> 01:01:51.273
He... he said <i>"si".</i>

01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:53.909
That's Spanish for "yes".

01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:55.478
Genius, eh?

01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:58.246
I wouldn't know,
I don't have children.

01:02:01.115 --> 01:02:02.884
You know what, I... I'm not...

01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:05.054
I'm not feeling up to this.

01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:08.123
What do you mean?

01:02:09.257 --> 01:02:10.492
I'm tired.

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:14.230
It has nothing to do with you.

01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:17.199
Goodnight, Rory.

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:25.875
Because you can't make
a statement with a steak!

01:02:25.974 --> 01:02:27.442
It's just not what I'm about.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:30.012
Hey, I'm just looking out
for you here, buddy.

01:02:30.045 --> 01:02:32.181
Right? I mean, that's what
they brought me in to do.

01:02:33.148 --> 01:02:36.519
You'll see the materials alone
in this... what do you call it?

01:02:38.119 --> 01:02:39.989
- Tasting the beach?
- Walking the beach.

01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:41.990
"Walking the beach", right.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:43.992
I mean, that'd knock us
over budget before we...

01:02:45.226 --> 01:02:46.362
Oh, don't mind me.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:47.930
I'm just passing through.

01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:52.001
I've seen how it works
at White River.

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.237
And they're booked up
a year in advance.

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.905
Ian, the thing is...

01:02:57.539 --> 01:02:59.075
you don't have a cooking show
on Bravo.

01:02:59.507 --> 01:03:02.043
- Yet.
- Being a chef is not just about

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:03.377
giving people
what they think they want.

01:03:03.411 --> 01:03:05.513
It's about opening their minds
up to what they didn't even know

01:03:05.547 --> 01:03:07.115
- they were longing for.
- Ian.

01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:09.384
I'm with you, right?
We'll just keep dialoguing

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.287
till we work out
the little kinks, yeah?

01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:15.290
To the future.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.798
Good. I'll send the contracts
over to you tomorrow.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.539
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:32.240
Oh, mind your own business, Dad.

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:35.978
You might as well have a drink.

01:03:38.646 --> 01:03:39.981
Oh, pour me one then.

01:03:56.231 --> 01:03:58.935
So, you haven't forgotten
all your Gaelic.

01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:02.137
Ah, I've heard it so many times
I could say it in my sleep.

01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:04.239
That...

01:04:05.206 --> 01:04:06.909
is the closest thing to Vallasay
round here.

01:04:12.213 --> 01:04:14.217
What do you think
about my food, Dad?

01:04:16.518 --> 01:04:18.521
Look, son...

01:04:19.353 --> 01:04:21.056
When I take a bite at something

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.892
I don't expect it to bite back.

01:04:23.925 --> 01:04:26.461
- So you hate it then?
- No, that's not what I said.

01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:30.599
I'm a simple man
and I have simple tastes.

01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:33.903
Ah, well. You never really
understood anything I did.

01:04:34.101 --> 01:04:36.438
But at least I'm not a hypocrite
like Emily's father.

01:04:37.172 --> 01:04:38.307
Who spat it out

01:04:38.706 --> 01:04:40.342
and kissed your arse afterwards.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.477
Don't have a go at Frank

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.645
- just because he's...
- Ian.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:44.513
Believe me in this.

01:04:45.079 --> 01:04:47.115
Life's too short to give a fuck

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:52.521
about what an old fool like me
or a pompous ass like Frank

01:04:52.653 --> 01:04:54.023
thinks about your food.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.059
Do what you love
while you can

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.528
before you've got one foot
in the grave

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:02.931
and it's too late.

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:10.139
Dad...

01:05:11.273 --> 01:05:12.173
Drink up, boy.

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.154
Brave lad, brave lad!

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:01.190
That's it! That's it!

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.557
Good boy.

01:06:05.327 --> 01:06:07.229
You can do it. That's it.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:08.331
Come on!

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:09.632
Oh!

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.401
Oh!

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:15.271
Well done, eh? Now...

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.606
This'll be one of our secrets,
yeah?

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:20.375
We will not tell a soul, OK?

01:06:20.608 --> 01:06:22.143
Yes. Yes.

01:06:23.744 --> 01:06:24.713
Good boy.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.450
Ah, yes. Come on now.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.051
Let's cuddle up.

01:06:52.507 --> 01:06:55.010
Oh, Dad, Dad, Dad!
Wake up! Look, look!

01:06:58.313 --> 01:06:59.748
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm filming him.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.116
Put that damn thing away!

01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:03.284
Just look, with your eyes!

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.657
Come on.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.169
Oh, come here, fella!

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.240
Oh, look at you! You champion!

01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:26.141
How did he get out of bed?

01:07:26.641 --> 01:07:28.077
I don't know, I was asleep.

01:07:29.143 --> 01:07:30.145
What, you slept here?

01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:33.681
Well, I don't think any of us
slept in our beds last night.

01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:40.321
I see that you are responding
very well to the treatments.

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:43.059
At this stage, the fact that
you're still active

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:46.394
and having a regular day-to-day
life is a small miracle.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:49.097
You still haven't told me when.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.733
You just wanna beat the guy

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:53.369
with the liver problems,
don't you?

01:07:53.768 --> 01:07:55.503
- How's he getting along?
- Oh, great.

01:07:56.137 --> 01:07:58.139
Great, almost dead.

01:07:58.373 --> 01:07:59.708
But it's...

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.177
it's not really about that.

01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:02.610
Um...

01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:05.681
Do you have any grandchildren?

01:08:06.347 --> 01:08:08.183
Oh, yes. Yeah, I do.

01:08:08.782 --> 01:08:10.385
These two little rascals.

01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:12.153
I really...

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:17.859
really want to hear my grandson
call me <i>"Seanair".</i>

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:22.663
Two months.

01:08:23.731 --> 01:08:24.765
Maybe three.

01:08:28.336 --> 01:08:29.404
That should be enough.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.517
Does that work, usually?

01:08:43.318 --> 01:08:44.353
Does what work?

01:08:45.185 --> 01:08:46.255
Apologising...

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:48.224
with flowers.

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.492
Oh.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.595
I wouldn't know.
This is my first time.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:56.564
Actually,
when I think about it...

01:08:58.233 --> 01:09:01.170
I don't believe I've apologised
to a woman ever.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.140
At all.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.180
Look, Rory...

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.283
I like you, I do.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.786
I don't think
this is going to work.

01:09:20.854 --> 01:09:22.457
I mean, maybe if we had met...

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.295
some other time,
like 30 years ago

01:09:27.627 --> 01:09:30.564
but I'm not really looking
for a relationship now, and...

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:33.202
You're...

01:09:34.536 --> 01:09:35.502
Dying.

01:09:37.505 --> 01:09:38.439
I know.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:41.644
I should have told you
about the cancer, I'm sorry.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:44.912
Well...

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:48.416
I've got...

01:09:49.684 --> 01:09:51.319
three months at best.

01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:56.692
But this is me, no camouflage

01:09:57.591 --> 01:10:00.295
full of scars and wrinkles
like your Roman pals.

01:10:00.862 --> 01:10:02.765
Maybe it's too late for laughs,
but...

01:10:05.332 --> 01:10:08.503
I really want you to be
in my life.

01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:11.941
Whatever's left of it.

01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:15.277
You don't have to
answer right now.

01:10:15.676 --> 01:10:16.744
So I shall...

01:10:17.011 --> 01:10:19.280
put these stupid flowers here

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.648
and I'll...

01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:22.917
- be on my way.
- They're not stupid.

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.561
Now you know my secret.

01:11:57.444 --> 01:11:58.680
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:01.483
I'm just saying that

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:03.451
I know that you understand
what I'm trying to do

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:05.454
but Jeff,
it's as if he doesn't...

01:12:05.686 --> 01:12:07.088
care who I am
or about my vision.

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.426
Wait till you see what I got
planned for Jamie's birthday.

01:12:10.692 --> 01:12:12.328
Nothing but the best
for that kid.

01:12:12.993 --> 01:12:14.595
The same goes for you too, Ian.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:17.399
Jeff Stradlow knows exactly
what he's doing.

01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:18.599
That's why I chose him.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.470
Listen, Frank, I'm not
questioning your judgement

01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:25.006
I'm just saying that maybe
we should find me a partner

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:27.943
who's inspired
by what inspires me.

01:12:32.447 --> 01:12:34.717
You know what?
If I'm gonna invest in art

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.652
I'll buy a painting
I can hang on the wall

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.053
and then resell for a fortune.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.122
Not something that turns to shit

01:12:40.154 --> 01:12:42.023
and gets flushed down the toilet
the next day.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:45.127
You really don't like my food,
do you?

01:12:45.693 --> 01:12:46.695
"Like."

01:12:47.662 --> 01:12:48.797
What does that mean?

01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:50.465
You know what I like?

01:12:51.698 --> 01:12:53.101
Grace, tact...

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.671
dignity, is there
a button for those?

01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:00.042
The truth is, it hurts me, Ian.

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:02.411
It hurts me to see you playing
yes-man

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.747
to some narcissistic
TV chef forever.

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:07.716
Are you getting in?

01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:09.551
I didn't say forever.

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:11.487
But maybe one day

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.555
some investor will come along
who actually believes in me.

01:13:14.788 --> 01:13:16.958
You know, I don't remember
you being this picky

01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:19.161
when it came to asking me
to help get Jamie

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:22.097
into the best nursery school
in the city next year.

01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:25.000
Or that apartment I practically
gift-wrapped for you.

01:13:25.233 --> 01:13:26.168
You're right.

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:27.636
I wasn't picky.

01:13:28.636 --> 01:13:29.904
But that doesn't mean I can't
take a pass now.

01:13:30.637 --> 01:13:31.672
You know what?

01:13:32.739 --> 01:13:34.009
You should've stayed a chemist.

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:04.840
- You're home.
- I wanted to see you.

01:14:07.742 --> 01:14:09.778
- Did Jamie say anything new yet?
- No.

01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:11.213
But he walked.

01:14:12.279 --> 01:14:14.215
- No!
- Just a few steps.

01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:15.649
Did you get it on video?

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:18.554
Ah, he was crawling
before I had the chance.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.789
Oh, honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:23.225
I promise you he'll walk again.

01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:24.760
Come on.

01:14:25.993 --> 01:14:27.261
Come on! Go on! Go on!

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:28.931
- You can do it, yeah!
- Come on!

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:30.164
Come on, come to Mummy.

01:14:30.597 --> 01:14:31.667
Come on, Jamie.

01:14:35.036 --> 01:14:36.038
You bought him shoes?

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:38.474
Oh, no. Dad did.

01:14:39.873 --> 01:14:40.876
You don't like them?

01:14:41.842 --> 01:14:43.545
I do, they're lovely.

01:14:44.045 --> 01:14:47.082
But they're not really supposed
to be wearing shoes

01:14:47.314 --> 01:14:48.616
at this age.

01:14:50.217 --> 01:14:52.054
But it's fine, we'll just...

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:54.623
save them
for a little bit later.

01:14:56.123 --> 01:14:58.260
Come on, Jamie.
Show Mummy how you walk.

01:15:02.597 --> 01:15:05.033
Ah, don't worry.
I promise you he'll walk again.

01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:07.235
Oh, I know, it-it's OK.

01:15:08.002 --> 01:15:10.205
You did so good,
Mummy's so proud of you.

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.740
He'll walk again, alright.

01:15:12.873 --> 01:15:15.711
Only you'll have to be around
if you want to see it.

01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:21.717
He thinks I'm a terrible mum.

01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:25.887
You're a great mother, Em.

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:28.190
You're a great mum.

01:15:32.793 --> 01:15:34.128
I don't even know
what that means.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.834
I'm completely just making it up
as I go along.

01:15:39.132 --> 01:15:40.702
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:45.039
You know, when I was growing up,
I only had my dad

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.807
and he worked day and night.

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.844
And now I'm doing
the same thing.

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:50.811
You're doing the best you can.

01:15:52.113 --> 01:15:53.081
We both are.

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:56.318
But are we happy?

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.721
See?

01:16:01.989 --> 01:16:03.658
You're supposed to say
yes to that.

01:16:04.024 --> 01:16:05.726
I need to tell you something,
Em.

01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:08.195
What is it?

01:16:09.997 --> 01:16:11.332
I quit White River today.

01:16:13.801 --> 01:16:17.939
Good. I mean, now you have more
time to work on the restaurant.

01:16:17.971 --> 01:16:19.707
I'm not gonna be taking
your dad's money.

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.045
- My dad already paid...
- I've already told him.

01:16:24.645 --> 01:16:25.613
You did?

01:16:26.247 --> 01:16:27.349
You asked me if I'm happy.

01:16:28.649 --> 01:16:30.152
I don't even know
what makes me happy.

01:16:32.686 --> 01:16:35.090
I just don't want to keep going
through the motions.

01:16:40.962 --> 01:16:41.863
Yeah.

01:16:43.363 --> 01:16:44.332
OK.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:51.039
Oh, I remember
another folk story.

01:16:51.738 --> 01:16:53.375
A really, really old one.

01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:55.277
The older the better, Rory.

01:17:18.365 --> 01:17:20.135
You've still got it, old man.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.903
Actually, he's just stepped in.

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:25.873
Rory, it's for you.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:29.745
Hello?

01:17:31.945 --> 01:17:32.948
Fraser?

01:17:38.985 --> 01:17:41.856
So... he gave up,
just like that.

01:17:46.793 --> 01:17:47.796
Ah...

01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:02.411
He's dead.

01:18:09.516 --> 01:18:10.452
Dad?

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.221
We're gonna have a bite
to eat in a few minutes.

01:18:14.255 --> 01:18:15.323
I'm not hungry.

01:18:18.158 --> 01:18:19.326
Just come and sit with us.

01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:21.829
Leave me alone.

01:18:34.442 --> 01:18:36.043
Should we check on him again?

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:38.814
I don't know. I give up.

01:18:39.146 --> 01:18:41.048
I thought he'd be dancing
in the streets.

01:19:08.408 --> 01:19:09.478
To the deceased.

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.783
Jesus, Dad.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:19.988
Drink up!

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:22.023
We should celebrate.

01:19:23.056 --> 01:19:25.426
I'm not gonna drink.
Give it a rest, he's dead.

01:19:26.359 --> 01:19:27.362
So what?

01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:29.864
You're on Campbell's side now?

01:19:30.163 --> 01:19:31.800
I'm not on anyone's side, Dad.

01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:33.167
Campbell's dead.

01:19:33.434 --> 01:19:35.103
You've got no one left
to pick on.

01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:37.005
So don't make this about me.

01:19:54.087 --> 01:19:55.556
There might be a day...

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.027
sometime very soon...

01:20:01.328 --> 01:20:03.097
I won't be here any longer.

01:20:08.301 --> 01:20:10.237
Do you understand me, my boy?

01:20:13.106 --> 01:20:14.141
I need you.

01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:29.256
If it wasn't for you...

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.092
I'd be long gone.

01:20:43.170 --> 01:20:45.841
We loved the carpenter
and the prick story, Rory.

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:47.541
Have any more of that?

01:20:50.043 --> 01:20:52.046
They weren't real folk stories.

01:20:53.514 --> 01:20:55.115
I was fooling the lot of yous.

01:20:55.515 --> 01:20:56.951
We know that, Rory.

01:20:58.118 --> 01:21:00.521
- We still like to hear them.
- More proof you're fools.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.092
How did you know that anyway?

01:21:04.225 --> 01:21:05.327
For what it's worth...

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.929
we think your stories are great

01:21:08.962 --> 01:21:10.030
and real.

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.266
As real as stories can be.

01:21:12.699 --> 01:21:15.302
Och, you know nothing
about what's real.

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:19.908
Or you wouldn't be listening
to an old man jabber.

01:21:20.106 --> 01:21:21.109
OK.

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.345
So tell us then.

01:21:25.011 --> 01:21:26.247
What do you think is real?

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.922
The child.

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:37.659
Rory, wait up!

01:21:42.329 --> 01:21:44.064
It's all here, all our sessions.

01:21:46.132 --> 01:21:47.101
Keep it.

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:51.605
For future generations.

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:22.003
Cheers.

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:25.039
Yeah, you are, aren't you?

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.408
Yeah. There we go.

01:22:33.079 --> 01:22:33.981
Ian?

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:35.150
- What?
- Where's your dad?

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:37.319
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:22:43.623 --> 01:22:45.292
Dad, what are you doing?

01:23:11.385 --> 01:23:12.554
Little early for a wedding!

01:23:19.592 --> 01:23:21.162
Shiver me timbers.

01:23:21.662 --> 01:23:23.030
What can I serve you, captain?

01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:25.567
Whiskey. The regular kind.

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:27.701
No fire, no smoke.

01:23:28.335 --> 01:23:29.471
Just whiskey.

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.206
Sure, man, whatever you say.

01:23:40.314 --> 01:23:41.615
Oh, look,
here's the birthday cake!

01:23:42.216 --> 01:23:43.251
Wow...

01:23:44.784 --> 01:23:45.753
Double.

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.789
I've come here to spoil you.

01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:50.759
Wanna spoil you to death.

01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:56.798
Aww...

01:23:58.599 --> 01:24:00.601
Here, here, Frank.

01:24:01.368 --> 01:24:02.804
- Let me take him.
- Go to Grandpa.

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.173
Go to Grandpa, there we go, yes.

01:24:05.338 --> 01:24:08.676
- That's alright.
- Oh, hello there, Jamie boy.

01:24:10.411 --> 01:24:13.047
I've got a wee surprise for you.
Yes, yes.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.618
Uh, Dad.
Where are you taking him?

01:24:19.453 --> 01:24:21.656
- Can I offer you a cocktail?
- Oh, none for him.

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.557
He doesn't want anything
I might've paid for.

01:24:23.823 --> 01:24:24.759
Dad.

01:24:25.192 --> 01:24:26.161
Thank you.

01:24:30.264 --> 01:24:32.067
That's some family
you've married into.

01:24:35.435 --> 01:24:36.703
Yeah, I think so too.

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:41.443
Here, look.

01:24:42.275 --> 01:24:43.744
Look, what's that?

01:24:44.377 --> 01:24:45.846
Eh? See? See?

01:24:46.546 --> 01:24:48.449
Now, shall we try
and see if it floats?

01:24:48.849 --> 01:24:50.717
Yes, let's see if it floats.

01:24:51.284 --> 01:24:52.854
There we go, yes.

01:24:53.287 --> 01:24:54.556
Look at that, that's for you.

01:25:19.313 --> 01:25:20.481
Isn't that grand?

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.816
Isn't that grand? Look at that.

01:25:22.182 --> 01:25:23.451
Here we go. Big one coming in.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.786
Big one coming in.
There you go, there you go.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:26.721
Oh...

01:25:28.221 --> 01:25:30.257
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:33.460
Oh, look!
Here comes the party pooper!

01:25:33.627 --> 01:25:36.297
Jesus Christ, Dad! Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

01:25:36.697 --> 01:25:38.466
The bairn's having the time
of his life.

01:25:38.599 --> 01:25:39.868
Get him out of there now!

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.636
Go back to your party, Ian.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.705
Me and Jamie
are doing just fine.

01:25:43.837 --> 01:25:45.406
I said, get out!

01:25:45.939 --> 01:25:47.341
Well, come and get him then.

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:48.909
I'm not playing around with you!

01:25:51.377 --> 01:25:52.679
Oh! Look at your daddy!

01:25:55.949 --> 01:25:57.152
Grow up!

01:25:58.452 --> 01:25:59.887
These are not Jamie's people!

01:26:00.554 --> 01:26:02.623
Ian, he doesn't belong here.

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:09.163
What's your plan? To take him
back to Vallasay with you?

01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:12.900
I'm not gonna make the same
mistake with him...

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.569
I did with you.

01:26:18.671 --> 01:26:20.942
Dad, you're dying.

01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:24.077
There's so little time left

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:26.547
do we really have to keep
fighting to the very end?

01:26:29.315 --> 01:26:30.551
Can't we just let it go?

01:26:33.587 --> 01:26:34.756
Just let it go, Dad.

01:26:36.789 --> 01:26:37.824
Please, Dad.

01:26:38.425 --> 01:26:39.460
Just let go.

01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:42.229
Come on.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:48.670
Oh, baby, oh...

01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:50.338
Come here.

01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:52.974
Now get out the water,
you'll catch a cold.

01:27:25.972 --> 01:27:26.975
Dad?

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:30.411
Is he even here?

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:32.313
Hold on, I'll go check his room.

01:27:42.422 --> 01:27:43.557
Whoa!

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.793
- Check out the wino, man!
- Ah, fuck off!

01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:49.396
Or I'll feed your rotten liver
to the devil.

01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:51.564
Fuck off
or I'll feed your rotten liver

01:27:51.597 --> 01:27:53.768
- to the devil!
- Nasty, dude!

01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:59.434
<i>OK, Professor,
we're rolling now.</i>

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.104
<i>And please try not
to use proper textbook Gaelic.</i>

01:29:03.203 --> 01:29:04.938
<i>Speak naturally.</i>

01:29:05.038 --> 01:29:06.673
<i>Oh, don't worry,
I don't know</i>

01:29:06.707 --> 01:29:08.076
<i>any textbook Gaelic.</i>

01:29:08.708 --> 01:29:10.478
<i>Ha. That's what you do here,
is it?</i>

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.947
<i>Listen to stories for a living?</i>

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.483
<i>I've been working
at the wrong job.</i>

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:21.823
<i>My name is Rory MacNeil.</i>

01:29:22.456 --> 01:29:23.958
<i>I'm 74 years old.</i>

01:29:24.658 --> 01:29:27.929
<i>I was born in Vallasay
on the Isle of Lewis</i>

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.731
<i>in the Northern Hebrides,
Scotland.</i>

01:29:32.966 --> 01:29:36.537
<i>MacNeils have lived in Vallasay
for nearly 2,000 years.</i>

01:29:38.572 --> 01:29:39.574
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.743
<i>Now tell us a story in Gaelic.</i>

01:29:42.576 --> 01:29:43.478
<i>Um...</i>

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.710
Rory!

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.612
Oh, oh, hello.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.114
- What happened?
- Uh...

01:30:21.648 --> 01:30:23.684
I... I think...

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:25.519
I have to lie down.

01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:31.158
Come on.

01:30:32.092 --> 01:30:33.627
Let's get you upstairs.

01:30:36.195 --> 01:30:37.864
- You're very sweet.
- You're so wet.

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:42.069
You know, a sofa
would have been fine.

01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:43.671
Oh, don't be silly.

01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:47.140
Let's get these damp pants off.

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.010
No, oh!

01:30:49.643 --> 01:30:51.779
Now, let me warn you...

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:55.682
these are the height
of fashion in Vallasay.

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:56.918
I swear.

01:30:59.019 --> 01:31:01.189
I always wondered what you wear
under the kilt.

01:31:01.854 --> 01:31:03.023
A mystery.

01:31:23.676 --> 01:31:24.711
Warm enough yet?

01:31:26.279 --> 01:31:27.614
Getting there.

01:31:30.216 --> 01:31:31.719
Would it be terrible...

01:31:32.752 --> 01:31:34.621
if we just held one another?

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.559
I don't feel up
to anything else.

01:31:40.627 --> 01:31:41.529
Oh.

01:31:43.029 --> 01:31:44.197
What I would give...

01:31:45.265 --> 01:31:47.502
for you to see me
back in the day.

01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:50.971
If I could only...

01:31:51.738 --> 01:31:52.773
Oh, this is...

01:31:54.707 --> 01:31:55.876
This is everything.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.148
We should have met years ago.

01:32:02.983 --> 01:32:04.018
We met...

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.119
at just the right time.

01:32:08.988 --> 01:32:10.524
But we don't have enough of it.

01:32:13.894 --> 01:32:15.663
Some people don't
even have this.

01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:18.699
Not even when they're young.

01:32:19.832 --> 01:32:21.935
Not even their whole lifetime.

01:32:26.105 --> 01:32:27.641
I know that smile.

01:32:54.967 --> 01:32:56.002
Rory?

01:33:01.641 --> 01:33:02.643
Rory?

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.757
Rory!

01:33:19.158 --> 01:33:21.295
Oh, God, oh, God! OK.

01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:23.965
<i>Stateman, Dr Stateman, please.</i>

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:30.237
Could you see
if his labs are back yet?

01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:31.205
Sure.

01:33:31.371 --> 01:33:32.707
You can see him now.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.307
How's he doing?

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:36.275
Well, we're gonna keep him here
overnight just to be safe

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:38.613
but he can go home
in the morning.

01:33:38.878 --> 01:33:42.349
There's not a lot we can do
for him now, medically speaking.

01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:45.185
Thank you, Doctor.

01:33:58.230 --> 01:33:59.367
You have a visitor.

01:34:14.213 --> 01:34:15.382
Do you need anything, Dad?

01:34:17.984 --> 01:34:19.387
Could you lift me up a little?

01:34:20.854 --> 01:34:21.756
Sure.

01:34:24.256 --> 01:34:26.126
OK, come here, come here.

01:34:26.292 --> 01:34:29.729
No, no, no,
use the remote, idiot.

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.145
How's that?

01:34:49.315 --> 01:34:50.216
Ian...

01:34:55.255 --> 01:34:56.257
take me home.

01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.926
Doctor says I can
take you home tomorrow.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.927
No.

01:35:02.429 --> 01:35:03.698
To our home.

01:35:06.932 --> 01:35:08.034
To Vallasay.

01:35:18.043 --> 01:35:19.279
We'll all go, Dad.

01:35:40.266 --> 01:35:42.502
You wait till you see my museum.

01:35:43.502 --> 01:35:45.805
Only mine is completely natural.

01:35:47.807 --> 01:35:50.377
It's made of the sea
and the stones.

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.380
You just stand there...

01:35:54.146 --> 01:35:55.181
Look at it.

01:35:56.248 --> 01:35:57.784
It takes your breath away.

01:36:04.323 --> 01:36:05.291
Rory?

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.863
I don't know, I...

01:36:11.564 --> 01:36:13.967
I don't think I'm going
to come with you to Vallasay.

01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:19.106
This is a time
for you to be with Ian.

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.475
It's time for him now.

01:36:22.842 --> 01:36:23.844
What about us?

01:36:25.612 --> 01:36:26.514
Oh...

01:36:27.913 --> 01:36:29.449
You have to have a pint with...

01:36:30.182 --> 01:36:32.051
Fraser and Alice in the pub.

01:36:33.185 --> 01:36:35.389
And you must dig
for mussels by the sea.

01:36:36.256 --> 01:36:37.490
And you have to come with me

01:36:37.524 --> 01:36:39.827
to piss on a certain
person's grave.

01:36:47.199 --> 01:36:48.568
I love how you make me laugh.

01:36:51.304 --> 01:36:52.940
Oh, it's alright.

01:36:54.306 --> 01:36:55.376
It's alright.

01:36:56.576 --> 01:36:58.078
You don't have to come.

01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:02.416
Anyway...

01:37:06.586 --> 01:37:08.155
you are Vallasay.

01:37:49.662 --> 01:37:52.532
Oh, look, Jamie, Jamie...

01:37:52.932 --> 01:37:54.969
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:37:55.935 --> 01:37:57.871
- Oh, my angel.
- Come on.

01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.811
Dad.

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:06.914
Dad, come here.
Come get in the picture.

01:38:07.247 --> 01:38:09.182
What do you take me for,
a bloody tourist?

01:38:09.682 --> 01:38:12.185
- Come on, Dad!
- And don't call me "Dad"!

01:38:15.255 --> 01:38:16.356
I'm <i>Seanair!</i>

01:38:18.557 --> 01:38:20.159
Right, come here.
Get in the middle.

01:38:21.427 --> 01:38:23.197
- Come on.
- OK.

01:38:25.364 --> 01:38:27.067
Right, come on!

01:38:27.266 --> 01:38:28.601
Oh, I want a smile out of you.

01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:30.337
- Look, Jamie...
- Come on, Jamie.

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:31.639
There you go.

01:38:36.542 --> 01:38:39.078
Dad, you wanna come and show
Jamie where we cut the mussels?

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.382
Why don't you do it?

01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:46.086
- You sure?
- It's about time you had this

01:38:46.118 --> 01:38:47.153
don't you think?

01:38:51.323 --> 01:38:52.692
I'll just safe-keep it
for Jamie.

01:38:52.725 --> 01:38:53.927
It's yours.

01:38:55.228 --> 01:38:57.530
I hope you pass it on one day

01:38:57.631 --> 01:38:59.300
but that's your decision
to make.

01:39:08.408 --> 01:39:10.144
I wasn't much of a warrior,
was I?

01:39:10.243 --> 01:39:13.346
Och! I gave you that too soon.

01:39:17.617 --> 01:39:19.552
I couldn't wait to make
a man of you.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.722
The kind of man I was

01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:25.725
I didn't have the patience

01:39:26.792 --> 01:39:29.429
to see the kind of man
you'd become.

01:39:31.497 --> 01:39:32.498
Let's go.

01:39:51.117 --> 01:39:53.721
<i>I won't be here
much longer to guide you</i>

01:39:55.788 --> 01:39:58.057
<i>but keep your eye
on the stars...</i>

01:40:00.659 --> 01:40:02.128
<i>they'll show you the way.</i>

01:40:05.064 --> 01:40:06.500
The important thing is...

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:09.536
if you love someone

01:40:11.171 --> 01:40:12.306
make sure to say it.

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.743
Don't think there'll ever be
a better time

01:40:19.212 --> 01:40:20.447
because there never is.

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:25.419
I could have made
a lot of people happier...

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:29.722
if only...

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:17.503
<i>Seanair.</i>

01:41:17.703 --> 01:41:19.539
- <i>Seanair.</i>
- Yes!

01:41:26.345 --> 01:41:27.313
Oh...

01:41:35.654 --> 01:41:36.823
<i>Seanair.</i>

01:41:39.492 --> 01:41:40.527
<i>Seanair.</i>

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:33.346
Look! This is where
your <i>seanair</i> lived.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.729
Jamie, come on!

01:42:54.533 --> 01:42:55.835
I'll race you to the house.

01:42:56.569 --> 01:42:57.871
I'm winning, I'm winning!

01:42:58.503 --> 01:43:00.774
I'm winning!

01:43:05.778 --> 01:43:07.713
Oh, you beat me again!

01:43:07.947 --> 01:43:08.916
Every time...

01:43:30.788 --> 01:43:35.788
