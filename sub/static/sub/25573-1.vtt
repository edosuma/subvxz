00:51.834 --> 00:53.009
Alec!

01:02.627 --> 01:04.150
We're gonna be late.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.941
Hi.

01:11.984 --> 01:12.984
Hey.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.122
You know, it's Tuesday.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.906
I know, I was just
in the neighborhood.

01:20.950 --> 01:21.950
Beth,

01:23.170 --> 01:24.780
I've said you can't
just pop by when...

01:24.823 --> 01:26.347
Just five minutes.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.788
All right.

01:32.831 --> 01:33.831
Well,

01:35.312 --> 01:36.811
I'm not just gonna leave you
standing out in the snow.

01:36.835 --> 01:37.856
Really quick, we're
on our way out.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.880
Okay, yup.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.626
Beth's here, Sam.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.454
Hey, Sam.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.325
He has soccer practice
and then a sleepover

01:48.369 --> 01:50.806
at one of his teammates' houses.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.547
Rather have one with me.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.221
All right, you can have a minute

01:55.245 --> 01:57.204
but we just gotta go.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.161
Thank you.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.205
Alec!

02:08.562 --> 02:09.868
Want a soda?

02:09.912 --> 02:10.826
Hmm?

02:10.869 --> 02:11.869
Soda?

02:13.481 --> 02:14.743
No, thank you.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.968
Wanna sit?

02:33.283 --> 02:35.851
Is that the sports pages?

02:35.894 --> 02:39.071
Anything interesting about
your beloved Knicks in there?

02:39.115 --> 02:41.355
There's nothing beloved
about the Knicks at the moment.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.259
Alec is doing really well.

02:56.872 --> 02:57.742
That's good.

02:57.786 --> 02:58.786
He's happy.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.356
That's good.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.490
It is good, Beth.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.237
You know what, Sam?

03:14.281 --> 03:15.282
Dad?

03:16.761 --> 03:18.285
Yeah?

03:18.328 --> 03:20.635
Can I barrow your warm hat?

03:20.678 --> 03:21.592
Hey, Alec.

03:21.636 --> 03:22.245
Which one, the blue one?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.333
Yeah.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.379
You bought that for me.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.423
I know.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.859
No, you can't, no.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.209
What? It looks better on me.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.733
It doesn't look better on you.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.800
When the kid is right,
the kid is right.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.825
That kid is all right.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.174
You do look better than me.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.654
Give me one of those fists.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.743
You said hey to Auntie Beth?

03:41.786 --> 03:42.786
Yeah.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.356
You wanna tell her
what Coach James said to you?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.793
He said that he might
make be the goalie.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.230
Really?

03:50.273 --> 03:51.816
What did Coach James
say to you about it?

03:51.840 --> 03:52.667
He said that...

03:52.710 --> 03:54.059
Big stretch.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.298
He said the most
trustworthy person

03:55.322 --> 03:56.453
has to have it.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.454
That position.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.542
Really?

03:58.586 --> 03:59.369
That's you?

03:59.413 --> 04:00.370
Mhmm.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.589
That's a huge honor.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.938
Dude, where's your trumpet?

04:02.981 --> 04:03.981
Oh.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.073
Here, tell her about band.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.641
I'm only second trumpet in band.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.382
I should be first though.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.776
But Dillon Moore sucks
up to the music teacher.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.298
Oh, doesn't he?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.648
Dillon Moore sucks.

04:17.692 --> 04:18.475
I got you...

04:18.519 --> 04:19.607
No sucking.

04:19.649 --> 04:20.869
I got you a present.

04:20.911 --> 04:23.263
A Wynton Marsalis CD.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.568
The guy at the store said that

04:24.612 --> 04:26.788
he is the best
trumpet player ever.

04:26.831 --> 04:27.789
Pretty cool, huh?

04:27.832 --> 04:28.832
Yeah.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.273
This is pretty cool.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.144
Yeah - Bud?

04:35.187 --> 04:36.817
Do you mind if I
hold on to this thing for you

04:36.841 --> 04:38.341
until after you finish Mr.
Pearson's science project?

04:38.365 --> 04:39.583
Good idea.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.758
And then you can play it

04:40.802 --> 04:43.239
over and over and over and over.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.763
Why can't we listen to it now?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.549
What's your science project?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.638
It's for the water cycle.

04:52.379 --> 04:56.208
We have to make a diagram
of how the water cycle works

04:56.252 --> 04:57.079
and stuff.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.385
We get to show it off.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.212
All right, guys,
we're gonna be late.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.083
Yes, you're gonna be late.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.345
You guys should go.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.347
Yup, all right.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.610
I do think you left your
trumpet in your bedroom.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.351
You?

05:08.395 --> 05:09.502
Let's go get your
trumpet. Come on, let's go.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.614
See you later.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.967
Oh, did you say bye?

05:16.011 --> 05:17.360
Bye.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.555
Bye, Alec,
I'll see you next time.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.579
Yep!

05:27.065 --> 05:28.328
Beth?

05:28.371 --> 05:29.894
Yeah?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.896
You gotta call before
you come over, please.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.158
Yes, yeah.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.290
Okay.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.118
I'm sorry about the CD.

05:37.772 --> 05:41.210
I never heard of a kid who
liked that kind of jazz.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.692
Is he any good?

05:48.913 --> 05:50.741
It's just,

05:50.785 --> 05:52.264
we don't just give presents.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.614
He earns rewards.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.703
We're not gonna spoil him.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.404
Also...

06:01.448 --> 06:02.448
What?

06:05.365 --> 06:08.803
If you run into people
in the neighborhood.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.501
We don't want people...

06:11.545 --> 06:15.375
Just don't go telling them
your whole life story.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.119
I'm sorry, we had to
move out of Fort Green

06:21.163 --> 06:24.993
and now we have a good
reputation for the family.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.430
Is that okay?

06:30.477 --> 06:31.477
All right.

06:32.914 --> 06:33.915
I'm gonna go.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.573
And I'm gonna get you the
stuff that mom left you.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.551
It's in storage but I'm gonna
have that for you next week.

06:41.575 --> 06:42.402
Great.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.445
That's great.

06:46.014 --> 06:46.797
Do you hear me?

06:46.841 --> 06:48.538
Oh my god, can I go?

06:51.149 --> 06:53.587
We have that meeting
tomorrow, right?

06:53.630 --> 06:54.630
Yeah.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.216
That's relaxing too.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.701
Is this okay? Not too hard?

07:27.185 --> 07:29.013
You are late!

07:29.057 --> 07:29.797
You have customer waiting!

07:29.840 --> 07:30.624
I'm sorry.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.060
Hurry up!

09:05.936 --> 09:07.416
What's up, Adele?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.421
How are you?

09:18.601 --> 09:20.241
They were lies because
I didn't hit her.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.737
But yeah, I hit her,
but it was self defense.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.043
Okay, well look, we're
on your side, Maria.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.306
We are not the ones
you have to convince.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.703
Well I have good news.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.661
Yeah.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.424
And all of this bad news.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.102
No, good news.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.627
Because of your good grades and
Miss Perez's recommendation,

09:44.671 --> 09:46.111
the learning center
I told you about,

09:46.150 --> 09:48.022
Better Options,

09:48.065 --> 09:51.329
has agreed to give you a full
scholarship to their program.

09:54.985 --> 09:55.812
Half or full?

09:55.856 --> 09:56.856
Full. Everything.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.208
Yeah.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.254
No, no.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.318
She says, "Are you lying to me?"

10:04.342 --> 10:05.342
No.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
It's the truth.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.656
It's a full scholarship

10:13.700 --> 10:15.460
and we're gonna appear
in court later this week

10:15.484 --> 10:17.573
to get the judge to
approve your transfer.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.750
Yeah.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.012
So soon.

10:23.579 --> 10:24.885
I wanna study.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.147
I know, you will.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.844
How exciting.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.978
And my baby?

10:31.021 --> 10:33.589
Am I gonna get him back?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.287
I think right now it's
one thing at a time.

10:36.331 --> 10:39.073
But your mom is doing an
amazing job with Mickey.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.204
She said he's happy.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.164
And he's healthy.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.207
Yeah.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.733
Do you have photographs?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.082
I don't have any.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.525
But we'll get some,
we'll bring you.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.914
We'll make sure we'll
bring her some pictures.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.480
Yeah, from her mom.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.395
You'll be able to hang
up all your pictures

10:57.439 --> 10:58.962
at Better Options.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.094
And...

11:02.183 --> 11:03.575
Sorry.

11:03.619 --> 11:04.619
It's okay.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.207
I was gonna say she
can talk to her mom

11:07.231 --> 11:09.538
but I know if she can
so don't say that.

11:09.581 --> 11:10.408
So close.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.452
Tell her, so close.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.022
Okay.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.676
And just, you know,

11:16.719 --> 11:17.764
no more.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.072
I didn't hit.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.116
I don't hit.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.772
They attacked me.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.820
Don't admit to anyone
else that you hit her.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.693
It was self-defense.

11:33.736 --> 11:34.650
I know.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.174
Feels nice with it, yeah.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.523
It's like a princess nightgown.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.570
This is the dress.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.876
That's my vibe.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.027
You don't
even need the lingerie.

11:44.051 --> 11:44.834
Just...

11:44.878 --> 11:45.878
Swoop.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.509
Just keep
cutting pieces of it off.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.752
I think it's just lovely.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.406
I think the form is perfect.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.190
I mean, do we have
thoughts, ladies?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.017
Glorious.

11:54.061 --> 11:54.888
Gorgeous.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.193
I don't know.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.629
I'm gonna cry.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.674
I'm gonna cry.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.502
I love the lace.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.069
Aw, you're gonna cry?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.901
Do you think it's
too much with the belt?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.380
- I was wondering.
- No.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.078
No?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.601
- Absolutely not.
- You don't think?

12:12.644 --> 12:15.778
Mom, I think she
wants to see it without.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.519
This comes off.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.912
We can just see it without it.

12:18.955 --> 12:19.782
Can I untie it?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.044
Sorry, is this okay?

12:21.088 --> 12:22.742
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.440
Just wanna show her the options.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.114
I just want her
to be able to see

12:28.138 --> 12:28.835
what it looks like
with it off, right?

12:28.878 --> 12:30.227
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:30.271 --> 12:30.880
No, no, this is what
I wanted. It's fine.

12:30.924 --> 12:31.881
Yeah.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.187
Look in the mirror.

12:33.230 --> 12:33.796
She wants to see the options.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.102
Why?

12:35.145 --> 12:35.798
She wants to see
what it looks like.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.234
Just let her see.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.061
That's how
the dress is designed.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.105
She just wants to look.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.065
I'll stay out.

12:42.109 --> 12:42.805
I think we need the
band back on anyways.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.067
It looks better with it.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.590
You're right, Jess is right.

12:45.634 --> 12:46.548
I don't think it's too much.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.071
I think it's beautiful, really.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.551
It's perfect.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.615
Is there a slit in it too?

12:50.639 --> 12:51.727
Oh, I love it.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.077
Oh my god.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.687
That's like a happy surprise.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.689
Jesus Christ.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.126
No veil.

13:01.345 --> 13:04.784
I feel like this green
is too Earthy for me.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.699
I don't really feel like this is

13:07.743 --> 13:08.918
the dress for us.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.224
Why?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.400
Because it's like forest green.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.184
Like, we look like trees.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.447
We have a lot of other options.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.101
Green, I know
they're green, mom.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.755
You know how I feel about green.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.365
What are you talking about?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.063
Green is meant to be bad luck

13:23.106 --> 13:24.586
for people who work
in the theater.

13:24.629 --> 13:25.630
We can't have that.

13:25.674 --> 13:26.849
No bad luck.

13:26.893 --> 13:27.893
Mother.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.156
Not now.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.637
No, it's really,

13:32.681 --> 13:34.311
it's a bad thing for
people in the theater

13:34.335 --> 13:37.468
because Molière, he was
an actor and a playwright,

13:37.512 --> 13:40.210
and he died in the
middle of a play

13:40.254 --> 13:41.864
and he was wearing green.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.388
So it's just tradition that
we don't like to wear green.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.955
Let's try blue?

13:45.999 --> 13:48.479
Blue would look beautiful
with a beach wedding.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.046
Yes.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.047
Are you okay with blue?

13:51.091 --> 13:52.527
Yes, yeah, it's fine.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.137
Are you sure?

13:54.181 --> 13:55.095
Yeah.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.096
Just tell her no.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.097
No, it's fine, it's fine.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.663
No, it's Monica's wedding.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.337
If she wants green, then
we're wearing green.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.797
It's not.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.146
It's really okay.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.384
If you wanna do
green, we'll do green.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.322
To show off their figures.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.715
We'll just at least try blue.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.040
Do you want everyone
to try another dress?

14:08.064 --> 14:09.805
Okay, everybody, let's
try another dress.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.982
Try pink, I love pink.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.027
Blue. Blue.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.942
Everyone will wear blue?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.770
Okay, let's just go.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.207
Yeah, it's fine.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.036
Can you just, can you pin?

14:23.079 --> 14:24.428
Oh yeah, sorry.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.734
No, it's okay.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.910
Daniel?

14:31.131 --> 14:34.047
Are you kidding me with that?

14:34.090 --> 14:35.090
What?

14:36.397 --> 14:38.486
Name one play by Molière.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.750
So let's...

14:43.317 --> 14:46.798
Backtrack because everything
is kinda interrelated.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.410
And let's talk a little bit
about the landlord situation

14:49.453 --> 14:50.890
with the residence
that you were at.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.414
Because if we can
deal with that,

14:53.457 --> 14:55.198
maybe we could
alleviate the situation

14:55.242 --> 14:57.548
with what's going on in
terms of the shelter.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.029
The point is that you
bringing a photo forward

15:00.073 --> 15:03.337
will make perfect sense
along with the citation.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.079
But the problem is if we don't
have photographic evidence

15:06.122 --> 15:07.950
then they can just
fight it and say,

15:07.994 --> 15:09.232
"It's not true. It's not true."

15:09.256 --> 15:10.083
Hey, Jan.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.432
How're you doing?

15:11.475 --> 15:12.713
I'm good, nice to
see you guys again.

15:12.737 --> 15:13.434
Good to see you,
good to see you.

15:13.477 --> 15:13.956
Say hi to Miss Jan.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.044
How do you do?

15:15.088 --> 15:16.437
How do you do?

15:16.480 --> 15:17.980
He was just explaining
to me a little bit about

15:18.004 --> 15:21.659
the situation with the
shelter that they were in.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.401
So if we actually took
a picture, got caught...

15:24.445 --> 15:26.099
Yes.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.971
You can't get fired from
a job for taking a photo.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.949
Is the avenue we need to
go down to find out what,

15:30.973 --> 15:33.497
what happened there
with the payment plan.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.543
Right.

15:35.586 --> 15:38.502
And any of the eviction notices

15:38.546 --> 15:41.592
that they might have gotten
or might not have gotten

15:41.636 --> 15:43.092
because that happens
all the time too.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.223
You want it to be in
the system that you went,

15:44.247 --> 15:45.727
that you were, you know.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.989
It doesn't meant anything

15:47.033 --> 15:48.445
if you just tell a
neighbor or something.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.079
That doesn't hold up in court.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.622
So we definitely need
you to go see a doctor

15:51.646 --> 15:53.430
and have that documented, okay?

15:53.474 --> 15:55.432
Did you guys already talk about

15:55.476 --> 15:57.217
what happened with his landlord?

15:57.260 --> 15:58.870
Is there any way we could just...

15:58.914 --> 15:59.697
We're definitely
having trouble with that.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.308
You know what I'm saying?

16:01.351 --> 16:02.004
It was the final notice and
it was only the first notice.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.310
Right.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.050
No having
stamps on the paperwork.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.007
Right. Right.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.313
You know, conniving stuff

16:06.356 --> 16:07.594
and I don't have a
way of proving it.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.987
I don't have a, I
can't afford a lawyer.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.404
You called several times.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.319
You hit the right place.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.992
We've got investigators who
can be able to deal with that.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.496
Thank you. I really
appreciate you.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.039
Yeah, we've seen
this a lot, unfortunately.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.063
Yeah.

16:21.763 --> 16:22.633
You wanted to see me?

16:22.677 --> 16:23.677
Yeah.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.030
Judge agreed to
release Sean Jones.

16:28.074 --> 16:28.988
That's great.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.207
What pushed it over the edge?

16:31.251 --> 16:33.035
Other than your genius.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.776
The knife.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.256
He realized that the prosecution

16:36.299 --> 16:38.301
was trying to sluff
over the screw-up.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.999
They were.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.759
So I'm gonna need you
to come with me tomorrow,

16:41.783 --> 16:44.960
if you can, to pick this kid up.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
I don't think I can tomorrow.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.094
I can help you...

16:48.137 --> 16:49.834
Believe me, I'm not asking

16:49.878 --> 16:53.534
because I wanna hang out
with your amazing self.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.188
Listen,

16:55.231 --> 16:58.104
this kid has been in jail
for fucking three years.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.975
I need some help keeping
him on the steady

17:00.019 --> 17:01.299
and you're really
good with that.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.369
What?

17:04.458 --> 17:06.415
Just seems like big bad Carlos

17:06.460 --> 17:07.678
is scared to go by himself.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.723
Oh, please.

17:09.767 --> 17:14.076
I gotta use everybody's
best assets here, girl.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.035
You're a pretty white girl.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.166
Sean's gangbanger friends
are gonna be there

17:18.211 --> 17:20.256
and I would quiet like
to have them focused in

17:20.300 --> 17:21.561
on looking good for you

17:21.605 --> 17:23.651
as apposed to being
all bent out of shape

17:23.694 --> 17:25.435
and out for blood
because their boy, Sean,

17:25.479 --> 17:26.567
was wrongfully arrested.

17:26.609 --> 17:27.481
Okay.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.091
Yes, I'll be there.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.808
Let me know if there's
anything else you need me to do

17:30.832 --> 17:32.573
other than be your bodyguard.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.377
Maybe you can try to
excavate that little charm

17:34.401 --> 17:37.099
from that cynical pit that
you call a personality.

17:37.143 --> 17:37.926
That would be cool.

17:37.969 --> 17:38.796
Mhmm.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.059
I'll dig deep.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.321
For you.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.845
I actually do
have something else.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.022
Grab a seat.

17:49.807 --> 17:50.807
Uh-uh.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.246
Good or bad?

17:53.289 --> 17:54.769
Well,

17:54.812 --> 17:57.250
that all just depends on
who's hearing it, right?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.686
Okay.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.905
I'm hoping for you
it's gonna be good.

18:00.949 --> 18:01.732
Deborah?

18:01.776 --> 18:03.082
Mhmm.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.909
She got offered this job in D.C.

18:04.953 --> 18:07.999
And she's taking it, she
told me this morning.

18:08.043 --> 18:08.957
Good for Deb.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.089
Yeah, good for Deb.

18:10.132 --> 18:10.959
Good for Deb.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.265
Good for you too.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.139
Come on, Jess,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.204
you were like third in your
class at Columbia, right?

18:19.228 --> 18:21.056
I'm offering you a job.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.189
Oh.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.802
Oh god.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.152
Carl's fine, thanks.

18:30.196 --> 18:33.242
I've only been a junior
litigator here for a year.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.026
I mean, there's like
five people ahead of me

18:35.070 --> 18:36.202
for that promotion.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.527
I run a meritocracy, here, Jess.

18:37.551 --> 18:38.987
I don't want them.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.032
In or out?

18:44.297 --> 18:45.211
I'm flattered.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.864
Don't be flattered.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.518
Be concise.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.627
I got like a sit down with
apposing council and a client

18:50.651 --> 18:52.522
in like an hour, so, yes or no.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.045
It's an amazing opportunity.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.264
I just...

18:55.308 --> 18:56.308
Concise.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.007
Councilor.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.230
I don't know what I
wanna do with my life.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.970
I mean, let alone with my job.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.014
I mean,

19:08.408 --> 19:11.454
I kinda came to the Watch
Dogs to figure that out

19:11.498 --> 19:13.413
and taking a senior
position here

19:13.456 --> 19:15.197
is a very, very big commitment

19:15.241 --> 19:18.461
and I thought I'd have another
year to figure that out.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.984
Yeah.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.247
Well, you don't.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.598
And the caveat to
this whole thing is

19:24.641 --> 19:26.339
that with this change,

19:28.123 --> 19:31.257
I'm gonna have to offer your
current job to someone new.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.780
Someone who's willing
to come in here

19:32.823 --> 19:35.348
and establish themselves.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.001
I told you what I'm
trying to do here.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.960
I'm trying to establish
these permanent teams.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.440
I'm trying to build
something here

19:40.483 --> 19:42.703
so we can actually do
something for this community.

19:42.746 --> 19:46.968
So it's kinda like shit or
get off the pot time, kid.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.535
Shit.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.297
Okay, so is that an exclamation
or is that an answer?

19:52.321 --> 19:53.844
Just give me a second.

19:53.888 --> 19:54.888
I mean,

19:56.891 --> 19:57.979
it's my mom.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.763
I still live at home and...

19:59.807 --> 20:01.069
You still live at home?

20:01.112 --> 20:01.939
You shouldn't tell
clients that, though.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.593
You should pay me more.

20:03.637 --> 20:07.206
Well maybe that's what I'm
in the middle of trying to do.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.598
Look,

20:08.642 --> 20:10.054
my mom freaked out when
I told her I was coming

20:10.078 --> 20:12.211
to the Watch Dogs for a year.

20:12.254 --> 20:15.083
She wanted me to go
to a big, fancy firm.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.389
Jess,

20:16.432 --> 20:19.087
I'm not offering
your momma the job.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.567
So obviously it's
best for all of us

20:20.610 --> 20:23.526
if this goes as
smoothly as possible.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.876
With the least amount
of stress for everyone.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.877
"Less stress."

20:26.921 --> 20:28.792
That's the operative word here,

20:28.836 --> 20:30.272
especially for young Alex.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.273
- Alec.
- Alec.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.405
Alec, yes.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.102
I'm so sorry.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.712
Been a long week.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.497
Alec.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.803
So what we've initially
proposed here...

20:39.847 --> 20:41.936
It's no longer acceptable.

20:45.809 --> 20:50.553
We talked about this on
the phone this week, Rebecca.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.164
What we're talking
about is shared custody

20:53.208 --> 20:55.297
in favor of your clients.

20:55.341 --> 20:59.301
We're not even asking
for time at Christmas

20:59.345 --> 21:00.302
or summer vacation.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.303
What's changed?

21:01.347 --> 21:03.262
My clients have changed.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.439
They've changed their
minds which is their right.

21:06.482 --> 21:10.312
Gabby and Sam, they both feel
that Alec needs consistency

21:10.356 --> 21:11.966
and they're worried
that moving him

21:12.009 --> 21:14.329
between two houses regularly,
it might but a strain on him.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.404
That's bullshit.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.492
Beth.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.015
You need to be quiet here

21:18.059 --> 21:20.366
because she's gonna be writing
down everything you say.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.758
Okay, just let me do this.

21:21.802 --> 21:22.672
The child is already confused

21:22.716 --> 21:23.934
about who your client even is.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.936
Due respect, that's
because your clients

21:25.980 --> 21:28.722
never even told the boy
that my client existed

21:28.765 --> 21:30.245
while she was incarcerated.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.729
Which fell within
their discretion,

21:31.768 --> 21:33.422
as the child's legal guardians

21:33.466 --> 21:34.921
the second your client
signed the consent form.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.860
My client signed a form

21:36.904 --> 21:40.168
when she was in a prison
hospital on suicide watch

21:40.211 --> 21:43.432
under the influence of major
sedatives and mood stabilizers.

21:43.476 --> 21:46.653
That's a really nice
image for the judge.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.003
She signed it, Carl.

21:49.046 --> 21:52.049
The legal guardians are not
willing to adjust custody.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.573
Excuse us, please.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.801
What're you doing, Bec?

22:04.845 --> 22:08.152
I'm doing what my
clients asked me to do.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.024
My client's looking
for a permanent job.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.460
Yeah.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.133
She's looking for
two bedroom apartments

22:13.157 --> 22:16.160
that she can hardly afford so
that she can be with this boy.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.248
Come on, Bec.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.601
Advise your clients
not to do this.

22:21.644 --> 22:24.168
This is family, here.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.561
It's a family.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.278
We don't wanna go before
a judge and argue this.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.609
Your client doesn't
want to go before a judge.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.873
Our side, we're fine with it.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.546
It's not my clients who are
going to hear the words,

22:34.570 --> 22:36.050
"manslaughter,"

22:36.093 --> 22:37.312
"drug addiction,"

22:37.356 --> 22:39.532
"maximum sentence"
attached to their names.

22:39.575 --> 22:40.944
They don't don't wanna
walk into a court room

22:40.968 --> 22:42.361
frightening Alec.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.232
Not your way.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.233
Rebecca.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.103
Carl,

22:46.147 --> 22:47.714
off the record,

22:47.757 --> 22:49.716
you need to say yes to
what I'm about to propose

22:49.759 --> 22:51.979
because the yare very
concrete about his

22:52.022 --> 22:54.198
and if you don't agree
to this new offer,

22:54.242 --> 22:57.158
I'm gonna leave this room,
I'm gonna go into court

22:57.201 --> 22:58.942
and I'm gonna push
for no contact at all.

22:58.986 --> 22:59.726
Really?

22:59.769 --> 23:00.769
Yes.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.947
She got out early on
good behavior, Rebecca.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.253
Look at that woman,

23:05.296 --> 23:07.516
she's completely
transformed herself.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.909
Hey, Gab.

23:08.952 --> 23:09.866
Beth!

23:09.910 --> 23:10.693
Shut up!

23:10.737 --> 23:11.651
I'm just...

23:11.694 --> 23:12.521
Gab?

23:12.565 --> 23:13.566
Okay.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.915
Hey, I'm begging you.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.613
I'm so sorry I came
by without calling.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.441
I'm so sorry about the CD.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.747
It won't happen again.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.184
I was just trying to
be friendly, you know.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.838
- We are willing to.
- I was hoping that

23:24.881 --> 23:26.119
- offer your client.
- We could be friends.

23:26.143 --> 23:26.796
- Shut up!
- Supervised.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.058
Shut up!

23:28.102 --> 23:28.972
- Beth.
- Visitation.

23:29.016 --> 23:29.930
Once a month.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.018
- No!
- Becca.

23:31.061 --> 23:31.410
Supervised visitation.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.106
No!

23:32.149 --> 23:32.933
Once a month.

23:32.976 --> 23:33.760
I'm begging you.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.326
I'm begging you, Gabby.

23:35.370 --> 23:35.979
Try to ask
your client to calm down.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.285
Can you please?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.548
I will do anything
to make this go away.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.158
Beth, okay.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.246
Gabriel?

23:43.378 --> 23:44.466
I'll do anything.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.467
Please.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.251
Stay with me for a second.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.296
Stay with me.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.864
You gotta calm down.

23:53.910 --> 23:54.650
I don't know what the fuck...

23:54.694 --> 23:55.695
You gotta calm down.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.305
You gotta calm down.

23:59.089 --> 24:02.005
We can agree to
this for right now.

24:02.049 --> 24:02.876
We can agree for this.

24:02.919 --> 24:03.920
It's the first step.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.400
We agree to this

24:05.444 --> 24:06.638
and then in a couple of months,

24:06.662 --> 24:08.490
everybody's a little
bit more comfortable.

24:08.534 --> 24:09.404
Yeah but they lie.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.753
And then we renegotiate.

24:10.797 --> 24:11.797
They lied.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.409
Carl?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.604
Do you see what
they're tying to do?

24:15.628 --> 24:16.585
They lied.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.195
They're trying to bait you.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.328
They want you to lose your
shit in this room, Beth.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.025
Don't do that.

24:22.069 --> 24:24.158
Don't do that for your boy.

24:25.551 --> 24:26.421
Carl?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.162
Give us a second, Rebecca!

24:28.205 --> 24:31.948
I'm so sorry, could you
please give us a second?

24:36.039 --> 24:37.954
It's not over.

24:37.998 --> 24:41.654
This is not over,
I promise you that.

24:41.697 --> 24:42.524
Okay?

24:42.568 --> 24:43.568
Come on.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.179
Okay.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.184
Okay, so for the
moment we agree.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.055
All right.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.317
You motherfucker.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.710
Beth.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.122
You're just gonna sit
over there and laugh?

24:56.146 --> 24:58.192
You put her up to
this, didn't you?

24:58.235 --> 24:59.541
That's enough.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.368
It was your idea, wasn't it?

25:00.411 --> 25:01.151
We're leaving.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.152
Okay.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.502
Because she'll never love you

25:03.545 --> 25:04.285
as much as she loved
Jeremy, is that why?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.634
Is that why you hate me?

25:05.678 --> 25:07.220
Because I tried to get
them back together?

25:07.244 --> 25:08.395
Come on, let's
go. Stand up, we're done.

25:08.419 --> 25:09.420
Sam?

25:09.464 --> 25:10.683
Pull yourself together.

25:10.726 --> 25:11.921
Is that why you don't like me?

25:11.945 --> 25:12.772
Carl?

25:12.815 --> 25:13.729
Pull myself together.

25:13.773 --> 25:14.556
Let's go.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.993
We are done.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.734
Beth.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.955
I advise that you
get your client to calm down.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.391
Hey Sam, I'm really sorry.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.629
I didn't mean to get
angry, I'm so sorry.

25:24.653 --> 25:25.567
Keep her away them!

25:25.611 --> 25:27.090
Hey, Gabby, I'm really sorry.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.091
All right, stop.

25:28.135 --> 25:28.744
I'm sorry that I got upset!

25:28.788 --> 25:30.093
It won't happen.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.137
It's okay.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.096
Beth.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.053
Beth, you need to
sign some papers.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.402
Fuck you!

26:18.446 --> 26:19.926
Fuck you!

26:19.969 --> 26:20.969
Fuck you!

26:25.453 --> 26:26.952
Another satisfied
customer, huh boss?

26:26.976 --> 26:28.630
I hate to lose.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.632
What happened?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.939
They refused to share
custody with her son.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.419
It's really messed up.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.073
They had agreed on
terms, you know,

26:37.117 --> 26:39.293
and then they sprang
it on us in the office,

26:39.336 --> 26:40.773
hoping that she
would lose her shit.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.079
Mission accomplished.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.123
Damn.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.170
I'm sorry.

26:50.173 --> 26:54.221
I'll be surprised if she
ever sees that kid again.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.100
La La, come here, La La.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.059
There's my girl.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.674
I wanna give you
my phone number.

27:55.717 --> 27:56.717
Why?

27:59.416 --> 28:00.416
Good point.

28:13.953 --> 28:14.953
Well argued.

28:31.927 --> 28:35.322
I didn't do as well on my
midterms as I woulda hoped.

28:35.365 --> 28:39.239
You know, school can
be kinda hard on us.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.981
And so I stupidly
had a few drinks.

28:43.634 --> 28:47.290
A huge mistake that I'm
extremely sorry for.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.163
And worse than anything,
when I got in that car,

28:50.206 --> 28:53.775
I put a lot of people's
lives in danger

28:53.819 --> 28:55.690
and that's unforgivable.

28:56.822 --> 28:57.822
Yet,

28:58.911 --> 29:02.175
I stand here today,
a changed man,

29:02.218 --> 29:04.307
thanks to the help
of my councilors,

29:04.351 --> 29:05.351
my family,

29:06.396 --> 29:09.704
and my sober
brothers and sisters.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.576
And I ask for that very thing.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.620
Forgiveness.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.408
And also, to become
a living amends

29:20.410 --> 29:22.761
to help out other young men.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.589
Face the truths of
their own demons.

29:27.635 --> 29:31.030
And on that note, I wanna
thank Officer Ramirez

29:31.073 --> 29:33.815
and I wanna thank
you, your honor,

29:33.859 --> 29:38.124
for giving me that wake up
call that I sorely needed.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.473
Well,

29:39.516 --> 29:41.605
thank you, Mr. Beckett.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.695
You've obviously done a
tremendous amount of work

29:44.739 --> 29:46.610
in your outpatient program.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.656
I see no reason why a young man

29:48.699 --> 29:50.440
with such a bright,
promising future

29:50.484 --> 29:52.791
should have his
whole life ruined

29:52.834 --> 29:56.577
because of a momentary
laps in judgment.

29:56.620 --> 30:01.234
A laps in judgment that you
are so clearly remorseful of.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.017
Thank you, your honor.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.889
That being said,

30:03.932 --> 30:06.413
there's the issue
of Mr. Vaperelli

30:06.456 --> 30:07.980
and how he's unable to work.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.591
He's been in that
situation ever since you

30:10.634 --> 30:13.159
hit him three months ago.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.202
So...

30:15.335 --> 30:18.077
How do you propose
to rectify that?

30:21.428 --> 30:22.492
I don't know, your honor.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.083
You see, I do.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.346
That's why I get
to be the judge.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.174
Here's my idea.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.872
I think that you, now that
you've completed your program,

30:30.916 --> 30:33.875
that you should work
with Mr. Vaperelli

30:33.919 --> 30:35.921
at his bodega for three months.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.966
For free, of course.

30:38.010 --> 30:41.491
Till you pay him back for
all the time he's lost

30:41.535 --> 30:44.973
and help pay for some
of the replacement staff

30:45.017 --> 30:46.714
he's gonna need to keep
that place running.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.996
What about my
school, your honor?

30:48.020 --> 30:51.414
After school and
on the weekends.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.459
Your honor,

30:52.502 --> 30:54.809
man, I'm grateful, I really am.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.074
Your honor, I got
finals coming up, man,

30:59.118 --> 31:01.729
and I don't know how I'm
gonna be able to do both.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.035
You're a smart guy.

31:03.078 --> 31:04.601
You'll figure it out.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.560
Good luck on finals

31:06.603 --> 31:09.084
and with your new job.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.259
Thank you, sir.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.217
But just...

31:11.260 --> 31:12.000
We're done. Come on.

31:12.044 --> 31:12.871
Bruce.

31:12.914 --> 31:13.872
Yes?

31:13.915 --> 31:16.222
People versus Mendez.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.226
How are you councilor?

31:28.974 --> 31:29.974
Hi.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.067
Hi, Maria.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.288
Thank you.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.079
Your honor, as you know,

31:47.122 --> 31:49.124
being incarcerated is
traumatizing for anybody

31:49.168 --> 31:52.388
but especially for somebody
as young as my client.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.018
I'd like to request her
handcuffs be removed

31:54.042 --> 31:56.958
while she's in the courtroom.

31:57.002 --> 32:00.657
The state has no
objection, your honor.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.442
Okay but I'm...

32:02.485 --> 32:05.140
I'm reading the case history
right here, Miss McCabe,

32:05.184 --> 32:08.535
and it seems that your
client found the fortitude,

32:08.578 --> 32:10.667
while she was
incarcerated last week,

32:10.711 --> 32:14.845
to attack two other inmates
and put one in the infirmary.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.282
Your honor, with respect,

32:16.325 --> 32:17.979
my client was the
one who was attacked.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.383
Here's a hint if you're gonna
ask the judge for something,

32:20.416 --> 32:22.375
try not to interrupt him.

32:23.854 --> 32:24.854
Denied.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.515
Your honor, a special
program called Better Options

32:32.559 --> 32:34.300
has offered to take Maria into

32:34.343 --> 32:36.737
their high school
equivalent course.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.652
She could continue
learning English

32:38.695 --> 32:41.263
and she would get individual
treatment for both whore...

32:41.307 --> 32:42.308
Her...

32:42.351 --> 32:43.657
Excuse me.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.920
Individual treatment for
both her mood disorder

32:45.964 --> 32:47.922
and her learning disability.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.968
It's all right here
in a scholarship

32:50.011 --> 32:51.249
and they could
take her right away

32:51.273 --> 32:54.407
and even offer daycare
for Maria's baby.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.018
Judge?

32:57.062 --> 32:57.932
I really...

32:57.976 --> 32:58.977
Not yet, Maria.

32:59.020 --> 32:59.716
Please, I really want to go.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.543
Maria, not yet.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.067
No, yes, I promise.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.287
I promise you that
I will listen.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.854
Start by listening to this.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.856
Don't talk unless somebody
asks you a question.

33:08.899 --> 33:09.900
Okay?

33:09.944 --> 33:11.467
Just make sure she understands.

33:13.861 --> 33:14.861
Okay, okay.

33:16.646 --> 33:19.258
Mr. Fischer?

33:19.301 --> 33:21.825
One second, your honor, please.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.180
I have no objection.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.489
I'm not convinced of this

33:33.533 --> 33:36.492
unless your client's
behavior improves radically.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.973
So, we're gonna revisit
this in two weeks.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.540
Your honor, with respect,

33:40.583 --> 33:44.326
they may not hold the
scholarship for two weeks.

33:44.370 --> 33:47.025
Maria could lose
this opportunity.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.244
Señor.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.071
Please.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.464
No, Maria.

33:51.507 --> 33:52.707
Tell her to be quiet, please.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.077
Maria.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.315
I'm not prepared to
send her out into society

33:57.339 --> 33:59.515
after such a recent
act of violence.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.649
So we will revisit this
in two weeks, on the 29th,

34:02.692 --> 34:03.476
and then I will decide...

34:03.519 --> 34:05.086
Your honor?

34:05.130 --> 34:05.782
This is the point where
you say, "Yes, your honor."

34:05.826 --> 34:07.132
Yes, your honor.

34:08.958 --> 34:09.958
Maria, Maria.

34:10.831 --> 34:11.918
Maria, look at me.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.616
Just wait two weeks.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.820
Sonya, tell her, explain to
her that everything's okay.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.360
Bruce! Bruce!

34:18.404 --> 34:19.404
Get her out.

34:22.668 --> 34:23.452
Tell her to calm down.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.627
Young lady!

34:24.670 --> 34:25.670
Young lady!

34:27.021 --> 34:29.937
You will not come in to
disturb my courtroom.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.286
Okay, calm down.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.635
Calm down.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.250
Thank you, your honor.

34:40.687 --> 34:42.645
I don't wanna be arrogant.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.125
You have my permission.

34:44.168 --> 34:47.128
Sound as arrogant
as you like, Beth.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.172
Okay.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.045
I'm strong-willed.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.790
If I commit to something,

34:56.833 --> 35:01.447
I'm not gonna quit, I'm gonna
see it through to the end.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.143
What else?

35:06.408 --> 35:08.106
I'm a people person.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.979
What does that mean to you?

35:12.022 --> 35:13.782
I was hoping you
weren't gonna ask me that.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.638
I mean that I think I
have a pretty good sense

35:18.681 --> 35:20.074
of what people want

35:20.118 --> 35:21.641
and I think I can
give it to them

35:21.684 --> 35:24.905
without them feeling
weak for needing it.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.865
Very clever.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.694
That's one of the secret
keys of the service industry.

35:31.738 --> 35:32.826
And the third?

35:34.697 --> 35:36.960
I'm good on my feet.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.590
I could only think of
that strong-willed thing

35:38.614 --> 35:41.530
and then I pulled that people
person thing out of my ass.

35:41.574 --> 35:42.879
So, I mean...

35:42.923 --> 35:44.838
Excuse me, out of the air.

35:46.274 --> 35:48.015
Yeah, sorry, I
don't usually curse.

35:48.058 --> 35:48.972
I don't usually curse.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.216
Oh no, don't worry about it.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.240
Okay,

35:55.283 --> 35:56.478
well, look, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.765
I need somebody for
this position yesterday.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.159
My last waitress just
walked out on me.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.856
Oh.

36:02.899 --> 36:06.990
Went to live with her
boyfriend in San Francisco.

36:07.034 --> 36:07.991
Bitch.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.079
Sorry.

36:09.123 --> 36:11.169
Now you can excuse my curse.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.260
What's with the the ten year gap

36:15.303 --> 36:16.870
in employment history, though?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.524
Did you have a child?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.920
I did, actually,
but that's not why.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.270
I went to prison.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.709
Right.

36:29.752 --> 36:33.191
But I was released on
good behavior a year ago.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.934
Okay.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.285
That's fine, you don't
have to get into the details.

36:40.328 --> 36:44.245
You want to ask me
anything about it?

36:44.289 --> 36:45.986
I really want this job

36:47.422 --> 36:49.903
and I feel like
I've fully benefited

36:49.946 --> 36:51.774
from the rehabilitation
that I received

36:51.818 --> 36:53.428
while I was serving my time

36:53.472 --> 36:58.041
and I wanna be totally upfront
with any potential employers.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.786
May I ask what the charge was?

37:03.830 --> 37:05.005
Manslaughter.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.535
Okay.

37:13.579 --> 37:13.927
Do you want me to
tell you what happened?

37:13.970 --> 37:14.970
No.

37:15.537 --> 37:16.364
No.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.408
That's...

37:23.328 --> 37:24.328
Okay.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.029
We'll call you in a few days.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.291
We'll let you know.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.660
I thought you needed
someone yesterday.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.076
That bitch in San Francisco.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.470
Yeah, no.

37:35.514 --> 37:36.297
I am available immediately
if you do need someone.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.385
I know.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.429
Sure.

37:39.169 --> 37:39.996
We do.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.040
I just...

37:43.391 --> 37:45.785
My supervisor needs
to look things over

37:45.828 --> 37:50.180
and he may have some other
people that he wants me to see.

37:50.224 --> 37:50.920
You know how it is.

37:50.964 --> 37:51.791
Yes.

37:51.834 --> 37:52.834
Yeah.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.360
Well,

37:55.403 --> 37:57.449
thank you for your time, Beth,

37:57.492 --> 37:58.580
and good luck.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.064
Please, please.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.066
I just...

38:11.898 --> 38:14.553
I really need this job.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.903
I'm trying to get my son back

38:18.861 --> 38:21.037
and I need this job so I
can pay a decent lawyer

38:21.081 --> 38:23.301
and have a chance against them

38:23.344 --> 38:25.346
and I just need someone
to take a chance on me

38:25.390 --> 38:28.218
because every time anybody
hears about my record,

38:28.262 --> 38:29.002
then they just...

38:29.045 --> 38:30.699
They...

38:30.743 --> 38:31.831
I just need...

38:33.311 --> 38:35.878
I just need one person

38:35.922 --> 38:37.967
to stand up and take a chance

38:38.011 --> 38:39.012
and I will...

38:42.755 --> 38:44.104
I'll do anything.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.092
Fuck.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.233
You all right?

39:26.276 --> 39:27.060
Yeah, no.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.103
That was...

39:30.716 --> 39:31.673
Yeah.

39:31.717 --> 39:32.717
You're...

39:35.895 --> 39:36.895
Um...

39:38.767 --> 39:40.421
Sorry, I have to...

39:40.465 --> 39:41.117
- It's okay.
- I gotta get back.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.249
Yeah.

39:44.904 --> 39:45.904
Um...

39:51.040 --> 39:52.278
We probably shouldn't
tell anybody.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.174
It's okay. We're good.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.131
I just don't wanna...

39:55.175 --> 39:57.133
I'm not telling anyone.

39:57.177 --> 39:58.091
Okay, cool.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.134
So?

40:02.225 --> 40:03.966
Will you call with the schedule?

40:04.010 --> 40:05.533
Just give me a day or two.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.447
Okay.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.230
All right, cool.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.057
Thank you.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.101
Yeah.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.456
There's a side door in the hall.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.283
I'll find it.

40:16.326 --> 40:17.937
I'll find it.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.765
Just, I don't want...

40:24.291 --> 40:25.248
I'll see you.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.512
- Okay.
- Yeah.

40:43.658 --> 40:44.964
Were you from?

40:45.007 --> 40:46.705
I'm from Fort Green.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.316
Oh.

40:53.494 --> 40:54.843
How long you been working here?

40:54.887 --> 40:55.975
A few months.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.674
Kim's my normal girl.

40:59.718 --> 41:00.718
I know.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.982
She told me to be nice to you.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.418
Yeah, she's a sweetie.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.333
She's got real future
ex-wife potential,

41:06.376 --> 41:10.598
if it hadn't been for the
whole language barrier thing.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.172
Oh, surprise, surprise.

41:21.783 --> 41:24.177
Fucking dick just
gave me three dollars

41:24.220 --> 41:27.223
for a 75 dollar treatment
massage and pedicure.

41:27.267 --> 41:28.355
Three dollars.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.444
Fucking dick.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.771
At least you get your
share at the end of the day.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.624
Oh, Mina, I don't
wanna hear it, okay?

41:36.668 --> 41:37.668
Look at you.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.604
Maybe if you worked a little
harder you'd get your share.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.412
What is up with you?

41:42.456 --> 41:43.675
Go fuck yourself, Beth.

41:43.718 --> 41:44.718
Kim.

41:46.895 --> 41:49.158
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

41:49.202 --> 41:50.202
You deaf?

41:51.770 --> 41:52.553
Why don't you say it again?

41:52.597 --> 41:54.294
Hey!

41:54.337 --> 41:55.034
Why don't you come over
here and say that to me again?

41:55.077 --> 41:56.557
Beth!

41:56.601 --> 41:57.340
You shouldn't have said that.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.341
You provoke her.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.473
Okay, come on.

42:09.701 --> 42:10.701
Shit.

42:14.053 --> 42:16.621
I'm sorry, Kim,
that wasn't fair.

42:18.318 --> 42:21.626
If I were you, I'd say "that's
fine" pretty quickly, Kim.

42:21.669 --> 42:24.542
"That's fine,
pretty quickly, Kim."

42:30.939 --> 42:32.550
Did I scare you?

42:32.593 --> 42:33.420
No.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.203
You looked scared.

42:34.247 --> 42:35.247
No.

42:39.513 --> 42:40.427
So what're you gonna do?

42:40.470 --> 42:41.559
I don't know.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.213
All I can think about

42:44.257 --> 42:45.713
is going to their fucking
hous and taking him

42:45.737 --> 42:48.914
after I beat the shit
out of my brother-in-law.

42:51.133 --> 42:52.918
And then what?

42:52.961 --> 42:54.286
Listen, I didn't say
it was a good idea.

42:54.310 --> 42:55.616
I'm not gonna do it.

42:55.660 --> 42:57.140
I'm just saying I
can't think about it

42:57.183 --> 43:01.100
without feeling like I'm
gonna fucking kill someone.

43:01.143 --> 43:02.143
Okay.

43:06.235 --> 43:10.109
Maybe you gotta think of this
like a test or something.

43:10.152 --> 43:11.240
Of your spirit.

43:11.284 --> 43:12.677
Oh my god.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.244
Mina, my spirit has
had too many tests.

43:15.288 --> 43:17.899
I don't think I
can take any more.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.379
It can.

43:22.382 --> 43:23.775
No, I think it can.

43:25.515 --> 43:29.432
But you have to decide the
next part of the story.

43:29.476 --> 43:30.476
Right?

43:31.652 --> 43:34.568
We decide in life the
results we deserve.

43:36.831 --> 43:39.704
What is that, some
Chinese proverb?

43:41.662 --> 43:42.663
Dr. Phil.

43:46.580 --> 43:48.364
You're a mess, you know that?

43:48.408 --> 43:49.801
Are these all gels?

43:49.844 --> 43:50.845
I don't know.

43:50.889 --> 43:52.978
I think gels ruin your nails.

43:53.021 --> 43:54.153
What about red?

43:54.196 --> 43:55.284
No.

43:55.328 --> 43:57.722
Judge Alonzo does not like that.

43:57.765 --> 43:59.158
He likes modest girls.

43:59.201 --> 44:01.029
Oh does he think
someone's intellect

44:01.073 --> 44:02.422
hinges on their nail color?

44:02.465 --> 44:04.250
Yes, he does.

44:05.686 --> 44:06.861
Hi.

44:06.905 --> 44:09.647
Who's getting the manicure?

44:09.690 --> 44:11.257
Uh, me.

44:11.300 --> 44:12.127
Great, I'm your girl.

44:12.171 --> 44:13.259
Come this way.

44:17.872 --> 44:20.614
You don't really take
care of these, do you?

44:20.658 --> 44:22.529
You sound like my mom.

44:24.923 --> 44:26.228
Somebody has to say something.

44:26.272 --> 44:27.534
You're a pretty young woman.

44:27.577 --> 44:30.711
You've got the nails
of a ten year old boy.

44:30.755 --> 44:32.408
Yeah.

44:32.452 --> 44:35.629
She's always getting on
me about stuff like that.

44:38.545 --> 44:39.851
By the way,

44:39.894 --> 44:42.897
you're much, much
younger than my mom.

44:42.941 --> 44:44.029
I didn't mean.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.509
Are you coming on to me?

44:46.553 --> 44:47.380
No.

44:47.423 --> 44:48.990
I mean, I'm flattered.

44:49.034 --> 44:50.731
I think, actually,
since I'm technically

44:50.775 --> 44:52.753
employed by you right now,
it's not really appropriate.

44:52.777 --> 44:55.301
No, I wasn't coming on to you.

44:58.826 --> 45:00.349
You're messing with me.

45:00.393 --> 45:01.089
I am.

45:01.133 --> 45:02.133
Okay, great.

45:04.266 --> 45:05.703
Oh, girl, no.

45:05.746 --> 45:09.097
You're not bitting
these, are you?

45:09.141 --> 45:11.230
Are you bitting your nails?

45:11.273 --> 45:12.884
Okay, I'm about to
change your life.

45:12.927 --> 45:14.624
This last thing I'm
gonna put on today,

45:14.668 --> 45:15.582
it's a solution that prevents

45:15.625 --> 45:17.149
people from bitting their nails

45:17.192 --> 45:19.431
but if you put your fingers
anywhere close to your mouth,

45:19.455 --> 45:20.718
it's gonna stink.

45:20.761 --> 45:22.130
I know, my mom used
to put that on me

45:22.154 --> 45:23.024
when I was a little girl.

45:23.068 --> 45:24.373
See that?

45:24.417 --> 45:27.420
I'm liking this mom of
yours more and more.

45:29.944 --> 45:34.340
Think of me fondly every
time you look at your hands.

45:34.383 --> 45:36.168
Do you have any kids?

45:37.473 --> 45:38.473
Nope.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.087
I just mean,

45:42.130 --> 45:43.455
you seem like you know
what you're talking about.

45:43.479 --> 45:44.805
You know what, this is
kinda tricky, actually,

45:44.829 --> 45:47.222
so I should probably
concentrate on this for now.

45:47.266 --> 45:48.266
Okay?

45:53.925 --> 45:55.317
Mom?

45:55.361 --> 45:57.363
Mom, I'm so, so, so sorry.

45:58.538 --> 45:59.538
I really am.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.803
We waited an hour

46:02.847 --> 46:05.806
but then I thought it was
best we start eating because.

46:05.850 --> 46:08.417
Daniel's parents wanted
to go to Time Square

46:08.461 --> 46:10.289
before their flight
took off this afternoon.

46:10.332 --> 46:11.769
Do we have to do this?

46:11.812 --> 46:13.074
I'm sorry.

46:13.118 --> 46:15.337
Daniel left just
like a half an hour ago

46:15.381 --> 46:17.600
but Monica's in the bathroom.

46:19.298 --> 46:20.125
Is she mad?

46:20.168 --> 46:21.779
You can ask her

46:21.822 --> 46:25.347
but I don't think she is
because we're used to it.

46:25.391 --> 46:27.654
Get off the fucking cross,
mom, we need the wood.

46:27.697 --> 46:28.742
I mean...

46:28.786 --> 46:29.893
Don't swear at me right now.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.310
Are you kidding me?

46:31.353 --> 46:32.548
Also, who has a brunch
in the middle of the day

46:32.572 --> 46:33.636
in the middle of the week, okay?

46:33.660 --> 46:34.617
I have a job.

46:34.661 --> 46:36.010
Oh you work? That's lovely.

46:36.054 --> 46:36.837
I work too.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.491
You sister worked,

46:38.534 --> 46:40.034
your sister worked really
hard on this brunch.

46:40.058 --> 46:41.015
We show up.

46:41.059 --> 46:43.365
We show up for our family!

46:43.409 --> 46:45.890
And just wipe off that look.

46:45.933 --> 46:48.283
Now is not the time
to be indignant.

46:48.327 --> 46:49.676
No.

46:49.719 --> 46:51.480
Now is the time for me
to be apologetic, right?

46:51.504 --> 46:53.854
You know, that's
why you love this.

46:53.898 --> 46:56.117
You guys get to be perfect
and I'm the fuck up,

46:56.161 --> 46:57.162
so I'm sorry.

46:57.205 --> 46:58.163
I do not love this.

46:58.206 --> 46:59.860
Okay, it's just.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.296
I...

47:01.340 --> 47:02.340
I don't...

47:03.472 --> 47:05.735
Well, I was just to
totally embarrassed.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.172
Give me a break!

47:09.304 --> 47:10.915
I mean, did anyone
try calling me?

47:10.958 --> 47:13.395
It's really not
our responsibility

47:13.439 --> 47:14.503
but we did try to call you.

47:14.527 --> 47:15.528
I am sorry.

47:15.571 --> 47:16.877
I know.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.376
Okay, I guess my
phone was on silent.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.925
I've been in court all
day fighting for this girl

47:20.968 --> 47:22.709
who just got sent
back to juvenile hall.

47:22.752 --> 47:23.710
I don't care.

47:23.753 --> 47:24.754
I really don't care.

47:24.798 --> 47:25.973
I know it sounds terrible

47:26.017 --> 47:28.019
but I don't care
about this person.

47:28.062 --> 47:29.847
I care about my
family, is that okay?

47:29.890 --> 47:30.717
So do I.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.500
Is that so stupid?

47:31.544 --> 47:33.067
No.

47:33.111 --> 47:34.025
- I don't think so.
- I care too.

47:34.068 --> 47:35.068
I do.

47:36.375 --> 47:37.375
You care?

47:39.813 --> 47:42.076
I am going to work, okay?

47:42.120 --> 47:44.035
I have to learn 28 pages.

47:49.475 --> 47:52.260
Maybe you can meet Daniel's
parents at the wedding.

47:52.304 --> 47:53.914
Unless, of course,

47:53.958 --> 47:57.962
there's one of the downtrodden
you have to save that day.

48:06.579 --> 48:08.581
She's being a little dramatic.

48:11.410 --> 48:13.760
Yeah, you know the
story, I'm sorry.

48:13.803 --> 48:15.936
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:15.980 --> 48:20.027
I'm gonna go look after
mom, make sure she's okay.

48:20.071 --> 48:21.071
Okay.

48:22.638 --> 48:24.249
I'll see you later.

48:39.742 --> 48:41.266
I like that color.

48:45.270 --> 48:46.662
Hello.

48:46.706 --> 48:48.403
I'm sorry, we're closed.

48:48.447 --> 48:49.447
Oh.

48:50.318 --> 48:51.319
I was just.

48:51.363 --> 48:52.451
Hi, excuse me.

48:54.844 --> 48:58.109
I just wanted to talk
to you for a second.

49:01.025 --> 49:02.026
Hi.

49:02.069 --> 49:02.678
Did you leave something here?

49:02.722 --> 49:03.722
Um, no.

49:06.856 --> 49:08.119
What can I do for you?

49:08.162 --> 49:10.599
I just wanted to
apologize to you.

49:10.643 --> 49:11.643
For what?

49:13.733 --> 49:15.996
When I came in and saw you,

49:16.040 --> 49:18.259
I pretended like I
didn't know who you were

49:18.303 --> 49:20.653
but I actually I recognized you.

49:20.696 --> 49:22.133
I know who you are.

49:24.048 --> 49:25.048
Who am I?

49:26.833 --> 49:29.183
I saw you the other day
outside the Watch Dogs

49:29.227 --> 49:31.664
with your lawyer, Carl.

49:31.707 --> 49:33.361
He's my boss.

49:33.405 --> 49:34.449
I work there.

49:37.061 --> 49:38.888
That was a bad day.

49:38.932 --> 49:40.325
Yeah, he told me.

49:41.761 --> 49:43.023
I mean, nothing specific.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.653
Yeah, well he's not
supposed to tell you.

49:44.677 --> 49:45.504
Right?

49:45.547 --> 49:47.114
Isn't that...

49:47.158 --> 49:47.810
All he said was that
things hadn't gone your way,

49:47.854 --> 49:49.116
which, to be honest,

49:49.160 --> 49:51.945
a blind person in the
street could've guessed.

49:53.947 --> 49:55.818
Do you need something?

49:56.863 --> 49:58.386
Well,

49:58.430 --> 50:00.214
do you wanna get a drink?

50:00.258 --> 50:02.062
I don't really drink
with people I don't know.

50:02.086 --> 50:04.914
Okay, well I wasn't
trying to be weird.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.264
Strangery.

50:06.307 --> 50:08.309
I just got in a huge
fight with my mom

50:08.353 --> 50:09.876
and I need a drink.

50:09.919 --> 50:10.746
What?

50:10.790 --> 50:12.096
"Strangery."

50:12.139 --> 50:14.228
I know, can you
give me a second?

50:14.272 --> 50:15.142
I'll come have a drink with you.

50:15.186 --> 50:16.013
Really?

50:16.056 --> 50:17.405
Yeah.

50:17.449 --> 50:18.992
Pretty much all I do is
drink with strangers.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.016
So,

50:21.627 --> 50:22.627
you'll do.

50:27.024 --> 50:29.330
It's gonna be like
10, 15 minutes.

50:29.374 --> 50:30.374
Okay.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.249
Are you sure you're okay
sitting here, by the way,

50:35.293 --> 50:37.164
near the bathroom?

50:37.208 --> 50:38.208
I'm fine.

50:43.997 --> 50:44.867
Sorry, what were you saying?

50:44.911 --> 50:46.347
Go on.

50:46.391 --> 50:48.219
I was saying that your
boss, Carl, fucked up

50:48.262 --> 50:49.742
and now I'm screwed.

50:53.267 --> 50:55.052
What's your situation?

50:57.532 --> 51:00.405
The Watch Dog's, it's
like a schoolyard.

51:00.448 --> 51:02.102
You know, everybody
helps everybody out.

51:02.146 --> 51:03.234
We share case info.

51:03.277 --> 51:04.496
Etcetera, etcetera.

51:04.539 --> 51:07.238
All under legal
privilege, of course.

51:09.196 --> 51:12.156
I know it's about a
kid but that's it.

51:21.904 --> 51:22.904
Ew.

51:24.385 --> 51:26.518
See, I told you it works.

51:29.390 --> 51:31.131
I know, I do it
like twice an hour.

51:31.175 --> 51:33.786
Eventually it's gonna
break you of the habit.

51:33.829 --> 51:35.527
You'll be thanking me.

51:40.749 --> 51:43.317
My mom makes me so angry.

51:43.361 --> 51:46.277
She just really knows how to
push my buttons, you know?

51:46.320 --> 51:49.106
Of course she
does, she made them.

51:53.675 --> 51:54.675
It's my son.

51:57.244 --> 51:59.072
My sister and her
husband took care of him

51:59.116 --> 52:00.421
while I was in prison.

52:00.465 --> 52:03.163
I went to prison but I
assume you know that.

52:03.207 --> 52:04.599
Yeah.

52:04.643 --> 52:06.142
And then I made Gabby
Alec's legal guardian

52:06.166 --> 52:07.907
because he was just a tiny baby

52:07.950 --> 52:10.475
and now they won't
share custody.

52:13.695 --> 52:14.695
Well,

52:18.396 --> 52:20.441
I mean it's understandable.

52:23.618 --> 52:26.012
What's understandable?

52:26.055 --> 52:27.927
Just, you know.

52:27.970 --> 52:29.383
Fuck you, that's
not understandable!

52:29.407 --> 52:30.625
They won't let me see my son.

52:30.669 --> 52:31.974
Well, no.

52:32.018 --> 52:34.499
What the fuck are
you talking about?

52:34.542 --> 52:35.542
Look.

52:36.457 --> 52:38.024
Forget I said that.

52:38.067 --> 52:39.436
I was trying to
think like a lawyer.

52:39.460 --> 52:40.655
I don't wanna make
a big deal about it,

52:40.679 --> 52:42.855
but don't ever touch
me again, okay?

52:42.898 --> 52:43.898
Okay.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.948
It's a touchy subject.

52:49.992 --> 52:51.385
So sorry, so sorry.

52:51.429 --> 52:52.430
It's okay.

52:52.473 --> 52:53.257
Need anything else?

52:53.300 --> 52:54.258
I'll have another one.

52:54.301 --> 52:55.215
Do you want another one?

52:55.259 --> 52:56.085
Sure.

52:56.129 --> 52:56.912
Okay.

52:56.956 --> 52:57.956
Thanks.

53:03.310 --> 53:04.310
Hey.

53:06.879 --> 53:07.879
I apologize.

53:09.229 --> 53:12.189
I need to just use the
bathroom real quick.

53:31.077 --> 53:33.297
Well look who we have here.

53:38.432 --> 53:39.912
Tell me you're not
torturing yourself

53:39.955 --> 53:41.696
for not letting me
give you my number.

53:41.740 --> 53:43.437
Okay, I'm not torturing myself.

53:43.481 --> 53:44.481
God, you're killing me.

53:47.659 --> 53:49.269
What're you, stalking me?

53:49.313 --> 53:51.271
Yeah, I'm stalking you
at my neighborhood bar,

53:51.315 --> 53:53.230
where we met least night.

53:55.319 --> 53:56.319
Peter?

53:57.582 --> 53:58.582
Peter.

54:00.019 --> 54:02.179
I did leave a really big
impression on you, didn't I?

54:05.503 --> 54:07.635
Let me see that for a second.

54:07.679 --> 54:09.289
One tiny, quick little second.

54:09.333 --> 54:11.693
You'll have it back before you
even know it left your hands.

54:20.996 --> 54:21.996
There you go.

54:23.042 --> 54:23.999
Now you have my number.

54:24.043 --> 54:25.305
Okay, now you have mine.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.306
I'm on to you, pal.

54:26.350 --> 54:27.307
Yeah,

54:27.351 --> 54:28.351
you got me.

54:30.354 --> 54:32.094
You might hear from me.

54:33.531 --> 54:35.576
Then again, you might not.

54:37.665 --> 54:39.058
You probably will.

54:44.193 --> 54:45.717
Was that a friend?

54:46.718 --> 54:48.285
Maybe, not really.

54:49.721 --> 54:51.418
He's cute.

54:51.462 --> 54:52.462
Mhmm.

54:55.379 --> 54:56.728
So what happened?

54:58.207 --> 54:59.687
What happened what?

54:59.731 --> 55:00.906
With your mom.

55:02.211 --> 55:03.211
Oh.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.609
It's kind of a touchy subject.

55:20.012 --> 55:21.927
She doesn't want any
visitors today, ma'am.

55:21.970 --> 55:23.711
Are you sure you
spoke to Maria Mendez?

55:23.755 --> 55:24.993
I talk to the girl every day.

55:25.017 --> 55:27.933
Right, of course, I'm sorry.

55:27.976 --> 55:29.935
Okay, can you ask her again?

55:29.978 --> 55:31.937
No, ma'am, she was very clear.

55:31.980 --> 55:34.243
Do you think you could maybe

55:34.287 --> 55:36.245
give her a message?

55:36.289 --> 55:37.899
Sure.

55:37.943 --> 55:40.815
Tell her that I got the
program to hold her spot

55:40.859 --> 55:43.209
and that she will be
transferred in two days.

55:43.252 --> 55:44.253
Okay.

55:44.297 --> 55:46.081
Have her sit tight until then.

55:46.125 --> 55:47.909
Tell her it will be okay.

55:47.953 --> 55:48.910
Okay.

55:48.954 --> 55:49.954
Thank you.

55:52.958 --> 55:53.654
That's weird, yeah?

55:53.698 --> 55:55.177
Yep.

56:11.803 --> 56:12.934
Is it weird?

56:12.978 --> 56:14.414
I mean, day drinking?

56:14.458 --> 56:16.416
I'm in if you're in.

56:16.460 --> 56:17.548
Fuck yeah, let's do it.

56:17.591 --> 56:18.549
Yeah?

56:18.592 --> 56:19.419
All right.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.725
I mean, look,

56:20.768 --> 56:21.247
it's one of the perks of
being the boss, right?

56:21.290 --> 56:22.683
Vince.

56:22.727 --> 56:24.119
Hey.

56:24.163 --> 56:25.817
What's up?

56:25.860 --> 56:28.254
So weird, I was just hang out
and you guys should walk by.

56:28.297 --> 56:29.647
It's crazy, right?

56:30.735 --> 56:31.779
Hey.

56:31.823 --> 56:34.173
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:34.216 --> 56:36.741
I didn't get a new phone.

56:36.784 --> 56:37.785
What?

56:37.829 --> 56:39.047
I did not get a new phone,

56:39.091 --> 56:39.961
in case that's why
you didn't call.

56:40.005 --> 56:40.832
You thought I had a new phone.

56:40.875 --> 56:43.400
I didn't, same phone.

56:43.443 --> 56:45.402
Thought you were gonna call me.

56:45.445 --> 56:46.664
Um, I can...

56:46.707 --> 56:48.187
No, no, no, sorry.

56:48.230 --> 56:49.449
Is that the new waitress.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.276
Are you the new waitress?

56:50.319 --> 56:52.234
Beth, here,

56:52.278 --> 56:53.473
was just walking past, let' go.

56:53.497 --> 56:54.715
I'm not walking past.

56:54.759 --> 56:55.542
I'd like to talk
to you, actually.

56:55.586 --> 56:56.413
Okay.

56:56.456 --> 56:57.283
Do you mind?

56:57.326 --> 56:58.326
I do.

56:59.720 --> 57:00.634
Why don't you just...

57:00.678 --> 57:03.071
What? Suck a dick again?

57:03.115 --> 57:04.179
You want me to suck
your dick again?

57:04.203 --> 57:06.858
Do you have to suck his dick?

57:06.901 --> 57:09.382
Did you maker her
suck your dick?

57:09.426 --> 57:11.950
Is that how you got the job?

57:11.993 --> 57:12.993
Kelly.

57:14.474 --> 57:16.476
You know what, I'll
meet you back inside.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.498
I forgot a draft of the menu
anyway that I wanna get,

57:18.522 --> 57:20.001
so can you ask Jamie
to print one out

57:20.045 --> 57:21.786
and I'll be right in.

57:21.829 --> 57:23.091
I'll be right in.

57:23.135 --> 57:24.005
Okay.

57:24.049 --> 57:25.006
Just stay warm.

57:25.050 --> 57:26.225
Be right there.

57:34.189 --> 57:35.713
Where does this go?

57:38.846 --> 57:41.501
In your mind, when you were
planning this whole thing out,

57:41.545 --> 57:44.417
where is the best
place that is goes?

57:47.376 --> 57:49.137
I don't like what you're
saying to me right now, Beth.

57:49.161 --> 57:50.162
I don't like it.

57:50.205 --> 57:51.076
It's scary.

57:51.119 --> 57:52.773
You're scaring me, Beth.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.079
What are you talking about?

57:54.122 --> 57:55.515
You come up and you threaten me

57:55.559 --> 57:58.866
and the girl I gave the
job you wanted to, that's...

57:58.910 --> 57:59.693
No I didn't.

57:59.737 --> 58:01.390
I'd say you did.

58:01.434 --> 58:05.046
You may have even told me
that you were gonna kill me.

58:05.090 --> 58:08.223
You may have said that you
were gonna hurt my daughter.

58:08.267 --> 58:10.661
I have a daughter, by the way.

58:10.704 --> 58:12.465
You may have even told me that
you have been watching her

58:12.489 --> 58:14.403
go to and from school.

58:14.447 --> 58:17.929
All because I didn't
give you this little job.

58:17.972 --> 58:20.584
I don't wanna see
you again, Beth.

58:23.151 --> 58:24.022
Do you understand me?

58:24.065 --> 58:25.065
I do.

58:32.552 --> 58:34.032
Okay, I was thinking about it

58:34.075 --> 58:35.860
and no, absolutely not.

58:35.903 --> 58:37.035
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

58:37.078 --> 58:37.905
Yes it was.

58:37.949 --> 58:38.689
Yes it was.

58:38.732 --> 58:40.125
It was.

58:40.168 --> 58:40.995
It most certainly was.

58:41.039 --> 58:42.170
It doesn't make any sense.

58:42.214 --> 58:44.782
Remember, Bobby went in drag.

58:44.825 --> 58:47.654
Oh my god, he
was Marilyn Monroe.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.047
What?

58:49.090 --> 58:49.656
So awesome but it
was jus the makeup.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.049
Just the face.

58:51.092 --> 58:52.722
The rest, he was still
in his school uniform.

58:52.746 --> 58:53.747
His makeup was amazing.

58:53.791 --> 58:54.661
He was so much better at it.

58:54.705 --> 58:55.575
Right?

58:55.619 --> 58:57.011
Got married?

58:57.055 --> 58:57.838
Married?

58:57.882 --> 58:59.623
Yes.

58:59.666 --> 59:00.774
I can't believe
the idea of that man

59:00.798 --> 59:02.669
confining himself to one dick

59:02.713 --> 59:03.844
is mind-blowing.

59:03.888 --> 59:04.976
Yeah.

59:05.019 --> 59:06.978
Okay, hang on. Hang on.

59:07.021 --> 59:09.633
The debate doesn't
make any sense.

59:10.677 --> 59:11.785
None of it makes any sense.

59:11.809 --> 59:13.637
We were 15.

59:13.680 --> 59:15.682
So you're dressed
as a beat poet,

59:15.726 --> 59:16.553
you're a...

59:16.596 --> 59:17.379
Love child.

59:17.423 --> 59:18.337
Love child.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.488
And Bobby is Marilyn Monroe?

59:19.512 --> 59:20.426
That's right.

59:20.469 --> 59:21.906
What's the topic?

59:24.691 --> 59:25.997
Something about the 70s.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.303
The 70s were a bad influence.

59:28.347 --> 59:29.827
Yes, that's it.

59:29.870 --> 59:31.524
Why weren't you there?

59:31.568 --> 59:33.395
I had been suspended, remember?

59:33.439 --> 59:34.439
Oh my god.

59:36.007 --> 59:37.637
For having sex with James
on the basketball court.

59:37.661 --> 59:38.444
That was then?

59:38.487 --> 59:39.314
Yeah.

59:39.358 --> 59:40.968
I mean, please.

59:41.012 --> 59:42.187
The infamy, the fame.

59:42.230 --> 59:43.754
No autographs, please.

59:45.712 --> 59:47.627
Okay, I will let this die...

59:47.671 --> 59:48.541
Oh, god.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.716
After the question.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.326
Okay?

59:51.370 --> 59:54.460
Where you for the topic
or against the topic?

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:01.835
I don't think we
had any fucking idea,

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.077
to be honest with you.

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.992
I just remember you kept talking

01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:06.515
about the Seven Deadly Sins.

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:08.058
Yes, oh again, no relevance
at all, what-so-ever.

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:10.258
And you kept repeating "lust."

01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:11.825
Lust.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:15.176
"Lust, Fiona, you can feel
it deep in your breast."

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.676
I think that's probably
why we were disqualified.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.353
Yeah, you think? Maybe?

01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:19.137
Totally worth it.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.573
Really?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.140
That's because you
didn't have to go

01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:22.836
in front of the entire school
and apologize the next day.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.316
Totally worth it.

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:27.449
You were always
trouble, you were trouble.

01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:29.060
You were.

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:31.263
My mom used to always say
you're gonna wind up in jail.

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:34.674
Fuck.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:35.501
Shit, I'm sorry, Beth.

01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:36.502
It's all right.

01:00:36.545 --> 01:00:38.591
Oh Sally, don't worry.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.288
I don't forget I went to jail.

01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:41.768
It's fine.

01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:44.118
Actually, they call it prison.

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:48.514
It's fine, who
wants another drink?

01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:49.297
No.

01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.647
Please.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.952
I want to but I...

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:53.606
Oh, come on. Don't
let that be the...

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.694
It's not, it's fine.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.130
It's fine.

01:00:56.174 --> 01:00:57.741
I thought that a
half an hour ago.

01:00:57.784 --> 01:00:59.632
Yeah, I kinda have to kick
you guys out in a little bit.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.222
Don't let this be weird.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:02.659
I really don't want it.

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:03.442
I know, I'm sorry.

01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:04.356
It's not weird at all.

01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:05.923
It's not weird at all.

01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:07.640
I have to go to a birthday party
with my stupid kid tomorrow

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.100
because it's so freaking early.

01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:10.797
Yeah, it's Henry's
only night off.

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:12.201
He's gonna be home
in a little bit.

01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:14.540
Oh and they haven't
fucked in two months.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.194
Sad but true.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:17.325
True facts.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:18.369
Cheers.

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:20.938
I'd like to meet him.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.722
Yes, we gotta arrange that.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.028
This month is a little tricky,

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:26.378
but I think next
month I'm wide open.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:27.684
So hopes Henry.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:31.664
It was so, sorry, you have
to have give that to me.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.645
It was right out there.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.168
It was right out there.

01:01:34.212 --> 01:01:35.039
It was hanging there
waiting for me to pluck it.

01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:36.214
Yeah.

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:37.868
Okay, so you call me

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:40.305
and we'll go to that new
Japanese place on Houseton,

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:41.262
I was telling you about.

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:42.873
Morgan's?

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:43.743
That place isn't new,
it's like three years old.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:44.875
Well it's new for.

01:01:44.918 --> 01:01:46.006
Shit.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.050
Hey.

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:49.923
One of us disappeared
for ten years.

01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:50.967
It's weird.

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:53.579
It's okay.

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:54.362
It's a little weird.

01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:55.233
It's a little.

01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:56.625
It's a little weird.

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:57.777
Okay, here's a dumb question.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.627
I'm gonna ask it.

01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:00.412
Uh oh.

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:03.241
Did you, are you able to
color your hair in prison?

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.156
I wanna know.

01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:06.113
That would be so important.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:06.984
That's one of my big fears.

01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:08.333
Hold on.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:09.595
I'm not able to...

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:11.728
Let's go on the
record as saying,

01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:14.295
we agree it's a dumb
question, right?

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:15.601
We agree it's a dumb question

01:02:15.644 --> 01:02:17.342
but we also agree
I need the answer.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:18.430
Yes you can.

01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:19.213
You can?

01:02:19.257 --> 01:02:20.257
Yes.

01:02:26.351 --> 01:02:27.569
Want some nuts?

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.834
I'm good, thanks.

01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:33.401
More wine?

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:34.707
No, thank you.

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:43.716
Are you on for a repeat
performance from last week?

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:46.588
Get me drunk, I mean.

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:47.632
No.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.307
Because you don't
have to get me drunk.

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:53.334
I'm pretty sure you're gonna
get lucky tonight, okay?

01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:54.640
Is that right?

01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:01.821
I'm gonna have,

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:02.648
do you want more wine?

01:03:02.691 --> 01:03:04.302
You drink the wine.

01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:12.527
Fuck this, you know
what I do want is...

01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:14.399
Hey, excuse me?

01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:17.097
Can I get a scotch,
double, please?

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.056
Same.

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:20.884
Sounds good.

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:26.106
I didn't even know
I had this jacket.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.150
It's nice.

01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:29.413
Thanks.

01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:33.244
You trying to impress me?

01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:35.985
Yeah.

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.467
Well, you already did that.

01:03:42.122 --> 01:03:44.168
So I should stop trying?

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:47.258
You don't have to.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.523
I was glad you called.

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:56.223
I was glad you answered.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:58.312
I haven't done that in...

01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:01.794
forever, called a girl.

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:10.063
I was actually nervous
coming over here.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:12.849
You were pretty confident
putting your number in my phone.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.894
Thought that was a bold move.

01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:16.287
Well, my life is

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.788
generally one badly thought
out move after another.

01:04:19.812 --> 01:04:22.380
So take that for
what it's worth.

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:26.601
You were nervous.

01:04:26.645 --> 01:04:27.645
That's nice.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:36.741
Tell me.

01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:40.659
My ex-wife.

01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:48.101
I'm sorry, this is a
stupid topic to bring up.

01:04:48.145 --> 01:04:49.145
Tell me.

01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.326
I don't know how
this is gonna come out

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.415
but I'm just gonna say it.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.202
The shit I saw over there,

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:04.770
in Afghanistan,

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:12.865
is some of the most horrific
shit that exists in this world.

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.434
But I miss it.

01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:21.743
Because I knew who
I was over there.

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:24.485
And I knew who my friends were.

01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:26.661
And trust meant something

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:29.099
and it was a fucking nightmare.

01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:33.451
But I was awake.

01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:44.679
But this shit with my
old lady and my kid,

01:05:44.723 --> 01:05:45.723
this is...

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:48.292
someone who...

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:53.123
I trusted completely.

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:56.778
She destroyed me,

01:05:56.822 --> 01:05:59.259
she took away everything I had.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.265
Took a different
kind of nightmare.

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.790
Because I know that
there's a monster out there

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:11.968
and I can't see it
and I can't fight it.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.417
How do you not
think of your daughter

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.332
every second of the day?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:31.725
I do.

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.870
Will you take me home with you?

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.964
Can I get the
check, man, please?

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.072
It's okay, I don't
care about the drinks.

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.923
I'll pay for them.

01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:57.100
Well that's mine.

01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.449
This one's yours?

01:06:58.492 --> 01:06:59.852
This is yours
and that's Sonya's.

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:02.539
Everyone.

01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:04.672
I'm making a mess here.

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:07.371
As usually.

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:08.546
I do! I do!

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:11.679
We've been drinking a lot.

01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:12.724
All right.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.204
To Monica.

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:15.248
To me.

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:17.946
To you!

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.078
To the bride.

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:21.080
To the blushing bride.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:21.950
Cheers.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.387
Beautiful bride.

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:26.433
We forgive you.

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:27.826
Thank you all for coming.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:30.002
And thank you for
planning all this.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.090
He's the best, right?

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:32.396
He's the greatest.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.721
I'm not so in
love with the in-laws,

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:34.939
but I guess that's
tradition, right?

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:36.139
Are they weird?

01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:37.382
Yeah, they're a little weird.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.070
Are you drunk? What's happening?

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.624
Let's open presents.

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:44.668
All right.

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:46.845
Woo!

01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:47.802
Woo!

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.717
Okay. This one is from...

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.633
Me! Me! Me! That's mine!

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:54.026
I was getting to that.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.116
This one is from Felicity.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.119
Oh, okay, really? Thank you.

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:01.642
There's a card in here.

01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:02.948
Wait, don't read the card.

01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:04.123
Don't read it out loud.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:05.777
Read it! Read it!

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.779
No, cards should
be read the next day.

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:08.822
It's true.

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:11.130
This is beautiful.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:12.131
It's like the one you had.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:12.958
Yeah.

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.220
Wow.

01:08:14.264 --> 01:08:15.371
You left the sticker on though.

01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:18.310
It's like the one you had.

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:19.399
But I got it red.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:20.443
Shut up.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.185
Thank you.

01:08:24.055 --> 01:08:25.144
This...

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:28.428
We're sticking
with this tradition.

01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:29.452
Yes.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:32.586
What is it? What
is it? What is it?

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:33.412
Show us.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.849
Come on.

01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:38.287
We knew someone had to
get you something sexy.

01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:39.288
Okay.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:40.854
Bow-chika-bow-wow.

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:45.817
Oh.

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:46.859
Yes.

01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:49.689
Put it on.

01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:56.957
Sonya, no phones.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.264
No phones.

01:08:58.308 --> 01:08:59.372
I'm sorry, it's the Watch Dogs.

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:00.613
No phone zone.

01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:11.582
It's Carl, he says
your phone is off.

01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.064
Did you hear that?
My phone is off.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:15.644
My phone is not
even in this room.

01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:17.283
Jess, take it.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.371
No.

01:09:18.415 --> 01:09:19.024
Tell him I'll call him back.

01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:20.068
Where were we?

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.591
We're passing out gifts, mother.

01:09:21.635 --> 01:09:23.898
He needs to talk to you.

01:09:23.942 --> 01:09:24.638
Okay, I'll be really quick.

01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:26.162
I promise.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.118
I'll be quick.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.162
Hi.

01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:32.167
No, I'm at my sister's
bridal shower.

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:37.434
Yeah, we're supposed to...

01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:43.179
Yeah.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:47.183
We're supposed to go
back to court tomorrow.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.725
Yeah, I know who you
are talking about.

01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:49.837
What about her?

01:10:00.239 --> 01:10:01.239
Okay.

01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:06.984
I, I, I...

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:15.167
Yeah, I'm here.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.912
I just, I gotta call
you right back, okay?

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:22.000
No, no, no, I'm fine.

01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:23.043
Bye.

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:36.928
I like that sound!

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.584
Play your best song.

01:10:47.373 --> 01:10:48.896
We're doing great.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.290
I think we'll have
even amounts, right?

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:52.160
On both sides.

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.597
Tickle?

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640
Tickle those.

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:01.605
It's got all these messages.

01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:02.736
Shooting star.

01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:41.166
You have ten seconds.

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:42.428
Ten seconds for what?

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:43.386
Wanna tell me what
you're doing here?

01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:44.909
I'm helping with the concert.

01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:47.955
I'm helping volunteer
with the parents.

01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:52.351
I made sure he
got raised properly

01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:53.589
because you couldn't
do it yourself.

01:11:53.613 --> 01:11:56.224
That help you sleep at night?

01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:58.246
It's called delusional reframing,
in case you're interested.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.576
Thank you.

01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:01.031
What do you call it when
a person re-imagines

01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:03.710
all the disgusting
things that they did

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:05.625
as somebody else's fault?

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.193
What about that?

01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:12.240
What did you think was
gonna happen when I got out?

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:13.851
You were just gonna lie to him?

01:12:13.894 --> 01:12:15.263
Till he was old
enough to be safe.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:16.201
What do you mean, safe?

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:17.333
Safe from what?

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.160
Me?

01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:20.204
Safe from me?

01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:29.475
I'm sorry, I don't wanna fight.

01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:30.346
Yeah you do.

01:12:30.389 --> 01:12:31.347
No.

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:33.610
You wouldn't come like this.

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:39.355
I know you're in a
hard position with Sam.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:41.661
I know he hates me

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:44.708
and he doesn't want
Alec anywhere near me.

01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:49.626
But could you just
ask him if he could...

01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:54.370
Can you just tell him
that I'll be nice?

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.243
Can you just tell him...

01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:05.337
Can you just tell him
that I'll do anything?

01:13:07.818 --> 01:13:09.820
I'll force him to like me.

01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:14.172
It's not Sam.

01:13:17.871 --> 01:13:19.311
He actually convinced
me, originally,

01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:22.615
to share custody with you
and I changed my mind.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:25.052
Because I want to protect Alec.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:29.187
If you just show
up like this again,

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:33.017
at his school, at the house,

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.280
anywhere that he's gonna be,

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.197
next time I'm gonna
call the police.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.874
Thanks for calling me first.

01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:06.442
You got it.

01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.792
You know we don't pay
overtime here, right?

01:14:08.835 --> 01:14:10.620
You've come to
drink with me, great.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.839
If not, fuck off.

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:14.493
Hey, for the record,

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:15.581
that's concise.

01:14:22.849 --> 01:14:23.849
Oh, damn.

01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:30.335
So the landlord, he put alarms
on the front door last week

01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:35.035
and they tend to go off when
the door gets open after hours.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:37.298
Yeah, the security guard
arriving with his gun drawn

01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:39.997
was kind of a
giveaway, thank you.

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.179
The answer's yes.

01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.268
Oh, well,

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:55.708
I didn't hear from you so I
kinda spoke to Terry about it.

01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:58.102
Well kinda unspeak to Terry.

01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:02.366
Carl.

01:15:03.237 --> 01:15:04.369
The job's mine.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:07.067
I thought maybe after today...

01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:08.305
You thought after today, what?

01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:10.375
I'm not going out on that.

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:15.815
You think that's the
kind of person I am?

01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:18.035
No, I don't.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:23.127
I'm never gonna let that happen

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.258
to one of my clients again.

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:25.433
Yeah, you will.

01:15:25.477 --> 01:15:27.000
No, I won't.

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:29.481
I won't allow that to happen
to anybody ever again.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.787
Yes, yes you will.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.528
It's gonna happen, Jess.

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:36.140
It's gonna happen over
and over and over again

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:40.405
and that's just the
way it's gonna be.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.670
You're not gonna let
that happen, huh?

01:15:44.714 --> 01:15:45.584
No.

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:46.846
Oh really?

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.805
Who the hell do
you think you are?

01:15:48.848 --> 01:15:50.434
I mean, if you can
stop it from happening

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.983
then I can definitely
stop it from happening.

01:15:53.026 --> 01:15:56.595
Don't you think I
would if I could?

01:15:56.639 --> 01:16:00.033
All you can do is fucking
give it your best.

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:07.475
Shit like today is definitely
gonna happen again and worse.

01:16:07.519 --> 01:16:09.453
And that girl dying, it
doesn't really mean anything.

01:16:09.477 --> 01:16:10.653
I mean...

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:17.268
It's a very sad situation

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.925
but it's not like you're gonna
learn some romantic lesson

01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:25.755
from all of this and use it
to save all the other girls.

01:16:25.798 --> 01:16:27.191
No, Jess, no.

01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:29.367
It's just one endless slog.

01:16:31.978 --> 01:16:32.979
Why tell me that?

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:35.721
Because you need to hear that.

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:38.332
Bad shit happens to people
who don't deserve it

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.247
every fucking second of the day.

01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:41.291
Yeah.

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:44.774
That's why we do
what we do here.

01:16:44.817 --> 01:16:47.341
That's why what we
do means something.

01:16:47.385 --> 01:16:48.865
It means something.

01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:50.867
Forgive me for saying this,

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:53.043
maybe it's a little heroic.

01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:58.590
I'm gpnna deny every
using that word

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:01.486
if you ever hit me
up with this again.

01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:11.714
Know what you're saying yes to.

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:16.109
The answer's still yes.

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:23.682
Don't stay out too late here.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:25.292
I need you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed

01:17:25.336 --> 01:17:26.776
when you come to
work in the morning.

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:30.123
Hey, the seniors here,

01:17:31.516 --> 01:17:34.171
we're the ones who
set the example.

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:38.654
Hey, Carl?

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:39.697
Yep?

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.093
There's a condition.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:46.879
Hey.

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.272
Oh my god.

01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:50.840
Did you get the
restraining order?

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:51.797
The restraining order.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:53.103
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:17:53.146 --> 01:17:54.602
I told you I don't
wanna talk about it.

01:17:54.626 --> 01:17:56.517
I don't like talking about
it in front of my job.

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:57.803
Okay.

01:17:57.847 --> 01:17:58.761
Well, you're probably
gonna have to get

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:00.153
used to talking about it

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:01.111
since I'm the one who's
representing you now

01:18:01.154 --> 01:18:02.939
in the custody dispute.

01:18:02.982 --> 01:18:04.505
Have you been drinking?

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:05.332
Yeah.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:06.376
How much?

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:09.292
All of it.

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:15.647
So just to be clear,

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.781
you didn't concent,
even verbally,

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:20.870
to your son being told
that your sister's

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:21.697
his biological mother?

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.654
No.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.569
No.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:28.486
All I know is that she
stopped bringing Alec to visit

01:18:28.529 --> 01:18:31.358
and then, when my mother died,

01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:33.186
she stopped coming altogether

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.034
and whenever I talked to
social services about it,

01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:39.584
they said that you can't
force someone to visit

01:18:39.627 --> 01:18:43.893
and especially once they're
the child's legal guardian.

01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:50.900
It's hopeless.

01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:53.816
It's not hopeless until
I say it's hopeless, okay?

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:56.819
You need to understand
one thing, Beth.

01:18:56.862 --> 01:18:58.057
I am the one who's running this,

01:18:58.081 --> 01:18:59.081
not you.

01:19:00.823 --> 01:19:02.259
Do you understand?

01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:06.915
Okay, good!

01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:09.962
Now,

01:19:10.006 --> 01:19:12.051
what have you got on her?

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:13.095
On who?

01:19:14.837 --> 01:19:17.622
You mean, besides
she stole my kid?

01:19:17.665 --> 01:19:18.666
Yes.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.972
And that she's a bitch?

01:19:20.016 --> 01:19:21.278
Was she violent?

01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:22.559
Did she use drugs while
you were growing up?

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:23.909
Did she cheat on
her first husband?

01:19:23.933 --> 01:19:25.195
Has she ever committed a crime?

01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:26.805
I need something I can use

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.087
that is going to scare
the living shit out of her

01:19:28.111 --> 01:19:30.374
so she gives us what we want.

01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:36.554
Why do you wanna help me?

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:45.519
This girl I was representing

01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:48.696
killed herself today in custody.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.740
She was 17.

01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:55.791
I had just gotten
her into this program

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:59.316
that was gonna help her
graduate high school.

01:20:02.145 --> 01:20:04.669
We were gonna appear
in court tomorrow

01:20:04.712 --> 01:20:06.584
to schedule her release.

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:12.329
I failed her.

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.071
It was my fault

01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:17.638
and she fell through the cracks.

01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:23.949
A judge refused her
a release last week

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:26.647
because Maria didn't
fit the picture

01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:30.303
of what a good person is
supposed to look like.

01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:33.916
Neither do you.

01:20:40.313 --> 01:20:42.968
Do you want my help or not?

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:44.013
Yes, please.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:46.928
Okay.

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:50.846
What do you have on her?

01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:00.116
When she graduated college,

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:02.031
Gabby worked as a teacher

01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:09.038
and there was a field trip
fund that the class had

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.343
to go to the zoo.

01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:12.128
There was a new
litter of lion cubs.

01:21:12.171 --> 01:21:13.781
Don't need to hear
about the lion cubs.

01:21:13.825 --> 01:21:18.047
And the class was raising
money so that they could go

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:25.097
and Gabby got caught
stealing the money.

01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:26.141
200 dollars.

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:30.146
She had a gambling problem.

01:21:31.277 --> 01:21:32.539
What happened?

01:21:34.324 --> 01:21:36.979
She got fired and that
was the end of the story.

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:38.545
Does Carl know about this?

01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:40.025
No, it was eight years ago.

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:40.983
Okay, well I'm going to make it

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:43.376
seem like it was yesterday.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.421
Hello?

01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:45.509
Your sister...

01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:49.165
got fired from being a teacher

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:52.733
because she was stealing
money from children.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.044
We're gonna go for full custody.

01:21:59.088 --> 01:21:59.915
What?

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:00.958
Yeah.

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:05.007
I mean your sister lied
to your son about you

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:08.575
and she has a history
of child abuse.

01:22:08.619 --> 01:22:09.968
Child abuse?

01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:12.188
Taking money from kids
that are in your care,

01:22:12.231 --> 01:22:13.145
that's child abuse.

01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:14.799
Is that child abuse?

01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:18.977
It will be when I'm done
telling the court that it is.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.650
She doesn't gamble
anymore, she went to therapy.

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:21.893
I don't care.

01:22:23.242 --> 01:22:25.027
And neither should you.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.558
You're protecting her.

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.215
Do you think she's
protecting you?

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.220
Do you know the things that
are gonna be said about you

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:45.830
in a courtroom in
front of a judge?

01:22:45.873 --> 01:22:47.440
Things that your sister

01:22:47.484 --> 01:22:51.096
is going to allow her
lawyer to say about you.

01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:58.016
Beth,

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.060
we need this.

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:08.418
If this doesn't go your way,
you may never see Alec again.

01:23:13.858 --> 01:23:16.165
When you're gonna punch
someone bigger than you,

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:17.688
you get one chance.

01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:22.345
You have to make it a good one.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:34.574
Do you need to throw up again?

01:23:34.618 --> 01:23:36.141
I probably should.

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:24.537
Good, huh?

01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:26.061
He's good.

01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:27.104
Sounds nice.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.804
Alec, that's my son,

01:24:30.848 --> 01:24:31.936
he likes jazz.

01:24:34.156 --> 01:24:38.595
He started listening to it
when he was basically a baby.

01:24:38.638 --> 01:24:39.857
My mom told me.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.252
So I've been listen to it.

01:24:44.253 --> 01:24:45.253
Cool.

01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:49.214
Where is he?

01:24:49.258 --> 01:24:51.695
Some of the notes sound wrong.

01:24:53.653 --> 01:24:54.828
I don't get it.

01:25:04.186 --> 01:25:06.231
You're gonna laugh at
me, that's all right.

01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:07.841
It's okay.

01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:10.714
I'm not laughing at you.

01:25:10.757 --> 01:25:12.107
Sounded like you were laughing.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:15.327
I'm laughing
because you're right.

01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:17.503
It's called dissonance.

01:25:17.547 --> 01:25:19.592
So that when it resolves,

01:25:19.636 --> 01:25:22.334
there's a sense of completion.

01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:24.051
No, I was gonna say you
didn't let me finish my thought.

01:25:24.075 --> 01:25:25.859
Excuse me, I apologize.

01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:26.730
It's okay.

01:25:26.773 --> 01:25:28.297
Continue.

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.300
I was just gonna
say what you said.

01:25:31.343 --> 01:25:34.085
That I know it's
supposed to sound wrong

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.044
so that it will
eventually sound right.

01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:38.872
Yeah, right.

01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:41.179
I guess.

01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:43.181
I mean, I didn't like
it at first either.

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:43.964
No?

01:25:44.008 --> 01:25:45.008
No.

01:25:46.706 --> 01:25:49.144
I really think, with
the exception of my kid,

01:25:49.187 --> 01:25:51.320
I think that a lot of the
really important things

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:54.758
in my life, the things
that I really enjoy,

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:57.543
I didn't like them at first.

01:25:57.587 --> 01:26:00.198
They kinda had to grow on me.

01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:01.068
Oh yeah?

01:26:01.112 --> 01:26:02.896
Yeah, you know.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.203
Maybe they're rude or abrasive

01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:07.162
in my first experience of them

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:09.338
but then they get a
lot sweeter and nicer

01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:11.514
and I figure out
how to handle them.

01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:12.515
You're a douchebag,
you know that?

01:26:12.558 --> 01:26:13.864
Oh, there she is.

01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:16.214
Welcome back, thank
you for joining us.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.830
You seem really good.

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:26.223
I am.

01:26:26.964 --> 01:26:28.226
It's nice.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:29.270
Yeah.

01:26:31.577 --> 01:26:33.797
It's always helping
me, which feels good.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.538
Helping you with what?

01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:36.321
With my son.

01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:37.365
Excuse me.

01:26:38.454 --> 01:26:40.499
I'm really sorry to interrupt.

01:26:40.543 --> 01:26:42.849
Are you from Fort
Green by any chance?

01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:44.373
Yeah.

01:26:44.416 --> 01:26:46.351
Did you grow up on Willowbee
Street in Fort Green?

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:48.377
Yeah, I lived on Willowbee.

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.682
It's Elizabeth, right?

01:26:49.726 --> 01:26:51.597
Beth, no one calls
me that anymore.

01:26:51.641 --> 01:26:52.598
Do I know you?

01:26:52.642 --> 01:26:53.860
Yeah, come on, it's George.

01:26:53.904 --> 01:26:56.167
You know, I grew
up on the corner.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:58.778
Oh yeah, maybe.

01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:00.084
Yeah, maybe.

01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:01.322
I was sitting over
there and I was like,

01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:02.584
"I know that girl
from going up."

01:27:02.608 --> 01:27:04.064
I thought, "No way,
that can't be true."

01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.002
You know?

01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:06.003
It's a small world, there,

01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:06.743
aye George from the corner.

01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:08.048
What's going on, man?

01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.747
Can I help you with something?

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.444
Yeah.

01:27:12.488 --> 01:27:15.578
You can get her to give my
best friend his sister back.

01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:17.623
You filthy fucking cunt!

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:19.016
What the fuck did you say?!

01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:19.886
Huh?

01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:20.844
Hey!

01:27:20.887 --> 01:27:22.237
What the fuck did you say?

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.605
You wanna fucking talk
to a woman like that?

01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:25.216
Why don't you show some
fucking respect, huh?

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.174
You might know her but you
really don't fucking know me.

01:27:27.198 --> 01:27:28.349
I will take your
fucking head off

01:27:28.373 --> 01:27:29.481
and not even think about it.

01:27:29.505 --> 01:27:30.506
Stop it!

01:27:30.549 --> 01:27:31.550
You fucking hear me?

01:27:31.594 --> 01:27:32.421
Come on!

01:27:32.464 --> 01:27:33.248
You fucking hear me?!

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.118
Yes!

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:35.772
Fucking piece of shit!

01:27:35.815 --> 01:27:37.077
I will kill you.

01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:54.094
Michael said that all I
had to do was drive the car.

01:27:54.138 --> 01:27:55.138
That's it.

01:27:57.968 --> 01:28:00.275
That he would go
in, rob the store,

01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:01.318
we'd go home.

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:03.494
Easy as pie.

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:10.980
I...

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.769
I heard the gunshot

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:22.166
and when he came out, his
face looked different.

01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:23.863
Like he was a completely
different person

01:28:23.907 --> 01:28:26.388
and I knew that something had...

01:28:27.606 --> 01:28:29.565
And he just told me to...

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.698
He screamed, "Go!"

01:28:32.742 --> 01:28:34.265
And I just slammed on the gas

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:36.833
without even
looking at the road.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:44.014
I almost didn't
even feel the thud.

01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:48.473
Until the whole car
bounced in the air

01:28:48.497 --> 01:28:51.413
when we ran over whatever
it was that I had hit.

01:28:51.456 --> 01:28:53.589
And I slammed on the breaks

01:28:53.632 --> 01:28:56.026
and I looked out
the back mirror,

01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:57.069
back window.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.295
There was just a little shape.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:07.124
I couldn't even
really see anything.

01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:10.040
And he screamed, "Drive!"

01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:11.868
And so I just took off.

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:18.353
And we passed a squad
car a few blocks away

01:29:21.094 --> 01:29:22.681
and they chased us
because I was speeding

01:29:22.705 --> 01:29:24.271
and then I hit a traffic light

01:29:24.315 --> 01:29:26.665
and Michael went through the...

01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:30.060
Thorough the windshield.

01:29:30.103 --> 01:29:31.975
Most of him did, anyway.

01:29:33.585 --> 01:29:35.326
It was pretty graphic.

01:30:00.743 --> 01:30:01.743
Fuck.

01:30:15.366 --> 01:30:18.456
Natalie was on her way to get
chili powder for her mother,

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.153
who was making dinner,

01:30:20.197 --> 01:30:21.720
and she had her headphones in,

01:30:21.764 --> 01:30:25.420
so she hadn't heard the
shot, didn't hear my car.

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:36.300
My lawyer said that
since Michael was gone

01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:39.129
that the judge was probably
gonna want someone to blame

01:30:39.172 --> 01:30:42.437
and that I should
expect a harsh sentence.

01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:48.660
I think it was especially
hard for my sister

01:30:48.704 --> 01:30:53.535
because she had finally
gotten over her own problems

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:57.843
and suddenly she known as
the sister of a child killer.

01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:02.630
I served...

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.330
ten years out of 15.

01:31:06.373 --> 01:31:07.984
I got out a year ago.

01:31:18.603 --> 01:31:20.300
I understand that you

01:31:23.086 --> 01:31:25.175
probably hate me now, so...

01:31:29.701 --> 01:31:31.137
Let me drive you.

01:31:34.271 --> 01:31:35.271
Thank you.

01:31:43.236 --> 01:31:44.236
Fuck.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.193
My clients agreed to this
meeting only due to the fact

01:32:07.217 --> 01:32:09.567
that there was an
obvious surprise

01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.482
the last time she was here...

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:12.309
Yes, well thank you.

01:32:12.352 --> 01:32:13.571
Having said that,

01:32:13.615 --> 01:32:15.138
we are expecting
something definitive.

01:32:15.181 --> 01:32:16.419
I'm glad you brought
that up, Rebecca,

01:32:16.443 --> 01:32:17.812
because we do have
something definitive

01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:19.098
to put on the table today.

01:32:19.142 --> 01:32:21.361
Go ahead.

01:32:21.405 --> 01:32:23.538
What I'm about to say,
my client has agreed,

01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.844
to keep in the confines
of these four walls,

01:32:25.888 --> 01:32:27.648
but in order to keep it
out of the courtroom,

01:32:27.672 --> 01:32:29.152
we are going to
need your complete

01:32:29.195 --> 01:32:31.894
and totally agreement
to our new terms.

01:32:32.851 --> 01:32:34.461
New terms, right.

01:32:34.505 --> 01:32:35.613
Okay, get to the point or
I'm walking them out of here.

01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:37.726
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:41.164
Some new and disturbing
information has come to light

01:32:41.207 --> 01:32:43.558
about one of your clients.

01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:46.604
It seems that when Mrs.
Bradly was a teacher,

01:32:46.648 --> 01:32:48.016
she decided it would
be okay to dip...

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.390
You can have full custody.

01:32:50.434 --> 01:32:51.434
Beth.

01:32:54.264 --> 01:32:55.047
Beth.

01:32:55.091 --> 01:32:55.918
It's okay.

01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.267
I'm not gonna contest.

01:32:57.310 --> 01:33:00.270
I will visit him if and
when you want me to.

01:33:02.794 --> 01:33:04.448
Alec is a little boy.

01:33:06.711 --> 01:33:08.539
Growing up is confusing enough

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.107
without putting
him through this.

01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:15.764
I don't want him to be...

01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:19.289
I don't want him to be my age,

01:33:19.332 --> 01:33:22.684
dealing with the
consequences of this shit.

01:33:23.859 --> 01:33:25.034
You raised him.

01:33:28.167 --> 01:33:29.604
You're his parents.

01:33:42.181 --> 01:33:44.053
You did a good job, Gab.

01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:48.013
Beth, do not do
this to yourself.

01:33:48.057 --> 01:33:50.755
So I put myself in your hands.

01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:52.365
Stop, you can't do this...

01:33:52.409 --> 01:33:53.584
Listen, stop.

01:33:58.328 --> 01:34:00.112
I can't tell you
how much it means

01:34:00.156 --> 01:34:02.898
that you wanted to
stand up for me.

01:34:09.992 --> 01:34:10.992
Okay?

01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:15.127
But this is it.

01:34:30.273 --> 01:34:34.364
You know where to find me
if you want us to meet up.
