WEBVTT

00:51.468 --> 00:53.636
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain speaking.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.223
Hope you are well rested. In about
five minutes, we will be beginning

00:57.307 --> 01:00.977
our descent into New Delhi International
airport on to runway.

01:01.519 --> 01:05.565
The temperature on ground is a cool
15 degree celsius. There's a slight haze.

01:05.648 --> 01:06.691
And a bit of turbulence.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.652
So please keep
your seat-belts fastened.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.755
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.006
Vladimir, right?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.134
Hi, when did you get here? Sit down.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.221
Please, act like you don't know me.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.472
I don't know you.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.058
Don't look at me.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.602
Oh.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.107
So, how was your flight?

02:30.358 --> 02:31.484
Don't talk to me.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.611
Just do as you were told.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.534
God! Fucking mental, some people.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.954
What did he think of himself? Idiot.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.626
Customs 02.

03:08.396 --> 03:13.902
"When there's abundant love in this world"

03:14.319 --> 03:20.199
"Wonder why the heart still yearns?"

03:20.325 --> 03:25.830
"When there's abundant love in this world"

03:26.039 --> 03:31.961
"Wonder why the heart still yearns?"

03:32.045 --> 03:37.425
"When there's abundant love in this world"

03:37.675 --> 03:44.182
"Wonder why the heart still yearns?"

03:55.235 --> 04:01.032
"How do I explain my heart?"

04:01.115 --> 04:07.205
"How do I placate my heart?"

04:18.716 --> 04:24.430
"How do I explain my heart?"

04:24.555 --> 04:30.353
"How do I placate my heart?"

04:30.436 --> 04:35.733
"My heart is stubborn"

04:36.276 --> 04:42.240
"It is out of my control"

05:09.058 --> 05:10.310
Open the door!

05:10.810 --> 05:12.603
I got it last time.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.774
Arup! Open the fucking door.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.443
He's lying. I got it last time.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.123
Bastard, one more time and I'll cut
your balls off and make you earrings.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.670
Alright fucker, you're dead.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.718
You deaf?

05:46.387 --> 05:47.221
When did you get back?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.264
Just now.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.892
Oh my gosh.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.020
Tashi, you're scratching me.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.521
Please go shave.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.191
Can't.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.150
There's no water.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.068
What do you mean, there's no water?

06:00.151 --> 06:01.569
You get two hours
of water every morning.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.030
Baby, we forgot to
put the buckets out.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.990
What do you mean,
"Forgot to put the buckets out?"

06:06.074 --> 06:06.908
Him.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.826
-What?
-It was his turn.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.245
Yeah, but you could hear
the water running, right?

06:11.370 --> 06:13.581
All you had to do was get
out of bed and put the buckets out.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.708
It would have taken
you all of 30 seconds.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.169
Yeah. But it was his turn.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.880
Oh my God! I can't believe
you guys live like this.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.007
What are you getting so worked up for?
We'll do it tomorrow.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.468
Because you're meeting
my parents for lunch.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.512
I want you to shave
and look presentable.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.847
I'm meeting your parents?

06:30.014 --> 06:31.099
Wear this.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.601
I've told you not to
buy me such expensive stuff.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.312
Just wear it, Tashi.
People judge you by the way you look.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.315
Yeah, I don't hang out
with any of those people.

06:40.399 --> 06:44.070
Listen, I'm not joking, okay Tashi?
You have no idea, how pissed I am.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.489
I'm going home now. Don't be late.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.997
Oh, man!

07:01.879 --> 07:03.214
Baby, can you drop
this for me, please?

07:03.297 --> 07:05.049
-This afternoon. It's urgent.
-I have an assignment, can't--

07:05.133 --> 07:06.551
Here's the address.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.264
The girl really loves you.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.975
Lucky bastard.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.894
Okay 3,2,1 go

07:20.106 --> 07:22.275
So, where is she?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.568
I'm looking.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.862
Why? You don't know
what she looks like?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.447
Shut up.

07:27.905 --> 07:28.990
Do you have her number?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.491
No.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.453
Man, you're the cow on
the information superhighway.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.621
Me? You're the one still
shooting film, you pussy.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.665
Digital is for fucking tourists.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.087
You're ringing, so you must be Tashi.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.965
Hi, I'm Menaka.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.342
Hey.
Hi, Tashi.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.553
A couple more hours
and we would've found you.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.556
-This is Nitin, my photographer.
-Hi.

07:53.639 --> 07:56.058
Menaka's a special correspondent,
just started with us today.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.645
Hi, Special Correspondent. Welcome.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.107
Alright, shall we?

08:03.274 --> 08:06.736
Because, I want to do everything I can,
you know. No limits.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.949
How would you define everything?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.160
Singing. Acting.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.412
I think, directing. No wait.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.039
Definitely directing.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.248
I paint.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.626
I'm working on my first
collection of poems.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.922
And I want to have my
very own clothes-line one day.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.340
Clothing line.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.758
What?

08:28.841 --> 08:29.759
Never mind.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.971
So, what do you enjoy most,
out of everything that you do?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.681
Everything.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.226
Of course. Just everything.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.061
That's why she does it all.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.187
Just...

08:43.064 --> 08:43.898
Lovely.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.650
Could you sing us one of your songs?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.485
Oh... I don't know.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.696
Come on, we've only got
a couple of minutes, come on.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.908
-Okay.
-Brilliant.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.244
Okay, it's called

08:56.911 --> 08:59.872
'I hate you, like I love you'

08:59.997 --> 09:01.999
Like I love you in brackets.

09:02.083 --> 09:07.421
So, it's like,
I hate you, brackets, like I love you.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.509
I hate you, like I love you,
in brackets. That's brilliant.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.056
"I hate you"

09:17.265 --> 09:19.267
"Like I love you"

09:19.350 --> 09:21.227
"I hate you"

09:21.310 --> 09:23.354
"Like I love you"

09:23.938 --> 09:25.982
And then, the drums come in.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.490
That's it.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.538
-Are those your lyrics?
-Yeah.

09:41.038 --> 09:41.998
We shouldn't have asked you to sing.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.375
-I can't get it out of my head now.
-So true.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.502
Hey, do you want me
to sign something for you?

09:46.627 --> 09:48.129
Because, I don't mind.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.839
Really? That's...

09:49.964 --> 09:52.550
You know how some celebrities
get all high and mighty?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.303
I just don't get it.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.181
Oh...

10:01.726 --> 10:02.768
Waste of my time.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.729
Hey, that's priceless.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.190
From this moment on,
any time you're depressed

10:08.316 --> 10:10.026
I want you to take a look at this and say

10:10.276 --> 10:13.487
"I hate you, like I
love you, in brackets."

10:14.989 --> 10:16.782
It's a magic photo.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.827
You can have it.
Tuneless and brainless.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.663
Hey man, being hot
is like a full time job.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.124
Dude, there's real news to be covered,
and this is the crap I get?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.876
Listen, she was news to me, Okay?

10:27.001 --> 10:29.211
And honestly,
I'd be happy to cover her anytime.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.838
With what, your paunch?

10:31.088 --> 10:32.048
For starters.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.008
You met my friend, Nitin,
the serial rapist?

10:34.091 --> 10:35.843
Hello, serial rapist.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.888
-Did you get something?
-Yeah, some for you, some for me.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.890
Alright, I'll be back after lunch.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.142
Menaka, nice to meet you.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.021
Where did I leave that package?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.649
-Hey!
-Oh.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.192
-That's mine!
-Sorry.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.451
Hello, Arup?

11:00.618 --> 11:01.702
-Arup?
-Can you hear me?

11:01.786 --> 11:02.787
What, fucker?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.415
Oh, no, no.
I was on the phone.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.708
-Arup?
-Hold on bastard.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.460
Okay Arup, this is nice.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.628
Very nice.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.587
Thanks.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.757
But do you think you
can make him a little happier?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.051
Happier? Who, the banana?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.595
Yes, you know like he's having fun.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.931
All his life he's wanted
to be in a banana-split

11:22.098 --> 11:24.475
and this is like a dream come true.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.269
Dream come true, for the banana?

11:27.436 --> 11:28.729
You know happy, something like...

11:29.814 --> 11:31.232
Could you just do it once more?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.359
If that's alright.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.737
-You got it?
-First thing tomorrow, I'll--

11:36.821 --> 11:38.989
No, no, no.
Now, the client is waiting.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.576
-Right now?
-Drop everything else. Do it now.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.245
Hello, Arup?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.580
Arup, are you there?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.125
-What?
-Hey, I need a favor.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.918
Can you drop that package off for me?

11:51.043 --> 11:52.420
No, I can't.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.796
Didn't you hear that?

11:53.921 --> 11:56.132
I'm stuck in fucking banana hell.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.884
-And she wanted to touch a killer whale.
-Come on they are

11:58.968 --> 12:00.010
-like dolphins.
-Mom?

12:00.094 --> 12:01.053
Papa? What are you doing here?

12:01.178 --> 12:02.138
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

12:03.431 --> 12:04.807
Surprise!

12:04.932 --> 12:06.142
Come, come.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.354
Even my Uncle's daughter got
married on the 29th of November.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.023
And they're so happy Mrs. Lhatoo!

12:14.066 --> 12:15.818
Sorry, 29th November?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.904
That's just a month away.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.947
You don't have to worry.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.241
Your mother and I will
do all the running around.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.701
Isn't that true, Mrs. Lhatoo?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.286
That's what mothers do, son.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.750
It's one.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.085
Where's that driver, Mom?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.837
Wasn't he supposed to be here at one?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.630
I have to go the tailor's after this.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
Relax, he'll be here.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.759
Tashi, did you drop that stuff?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.137
Hello? Yeah, Menaka.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.680
Yeah?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.515
Yeah, I know where it is.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.476
Yeah, I'll tell Nitin.
Okay, bye.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
Uncle, Aunty, I'm really sorry. I've
have to go, something's come up at work.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.025
No more Uncle-Aunty.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.360
Son, you're family now.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.280
From now on, mummy-daddy.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.282
What do you say, Mr. Lhatoo?

13:03.365 --> 13:04.408
That's how it is.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.411
Tashi, come with me son.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.830
I should really get going, daddy.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.873
-This will take
-Tashi, come.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.541
hardly one minute. Come on.

13:19.924 --> 13:20.758
Do you like it?

13:22.009 --> 13:24.803
Good. Take it. It's for you.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.931
Oh! I can't, daddy.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.225
Forget it.
We're not even discussing it.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.561
Son, we've even bought a flat for you.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.896
Just five minutes away.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.440
In the morning, we'll walk
over to your place for breakfast

13:36.524 --> 13:39.401
and in the evening you'll
both come over for dinner.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.030
It'll be wonderful. I just can't wait.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.423
Delicate.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.300
You can work wonders
with the right model.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.636
I'm guessing this is some for you

14:05.719 --> 14:07.096
and some for me.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.847
Son, say, "Cheese".

14:09.223 --> 14:10.474
Man, is nothing sacred?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.142
He doesn't mind. I asked him.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.648
So that pretty young thing
was a waste of your time

14:17.731 --> 14:19.108
and this is worthwhile?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.568
I don't know what that says about you.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.736
-That he's a serious journalist.
-Yeah.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.238
Or a necrophiliac.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.156
Yeah, a gay necrophiliac.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.117
Fucking idiots.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.243
Yours.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.287
-Mine.
-You're not coming in?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.997
No. Work to do.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.624
Listen, I got to file this.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.959
Can you drop this off for me?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.752
-No.
-Thanks.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.796
Here's the address.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.426
Go.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.432
What are you doing this evening?

14:51.515 --> 14:52.474
Oh, you know.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.184
Work.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.186
All work, no play.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.023
Tashi... dull boy.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.663
Give me one.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.000
"My capricious eyes convey"

15:18.125 --> 15:20.794
"Come by my lane someday"

15:20.878 --> 15:21.712
Make it spicy!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.756
"When the youth is at its peak"

15:23.881 --> 15:26.550
"It will be a sight worth watching"

15:28.469 --> 15:29.303
Let me go.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.512
You want some of this?

15:32.389 --> 15:37.394
"Cruel, beloved,
Come a little closer"

15:37.811 --> 15:44.735
"I'm a firecracker,
Fire up the matchstick"

16:01.877 --> 16:04.463
200? The rate's gone up.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.424
No, my darling.

16:12.680 --> 16:20.354
"I have saved myself from prying eyes"

16:23.107 --> 16:25.651
"Cruel, beloved..."

16:25.901 --> 16:28.654
"Come a little closer"

16:28.862 --> 16:31.407
"I am blooming bud"

16:31.532 --> 16:37.121
"Let me blossom completely"

17:03.605 --> 17:06.191
"My soft arms"

17:06.275 --> 17:12.072
"Feel just like cream"

17:14.658 --> 17:17.494
"There's a sensation
In my entire body"

17:17.619 --> 17:19.288
"When you wring my wrist"

17:19.371 --> 17:20.289
"When you--"

18:16.386 --> 18:17.971
-Hi.
-Oh fuck!

18:19.181 --> 18:21.433
What are you doing,
lying in the dark like that?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.062
I'm sick, man.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.147
I feel... poisoned.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.066
Did you see a doctor?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.068
Yeah.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.153
So here's what you need to do.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.863
Just take my scooter.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.741
-Why?
-Just take it.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.576
Fucker!

18:39.660 --> 18:41.120
Why am I taking your scooter?

18:41.245 --> 18:43.831
Tashi asked me to
drop off this package.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.457
That fucking thing
is still floating around?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.126
Listen if I wasn't sick, I'd do it.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.085
Sure.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.755
Listen, since you're
going out in any case

18:51.922 --> 18:53.132
can you do me a favor?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.174
What?

18:59.429 --> 19:00.764
Bastards!

19:01.598 --> 19:03.267
Bastards!

19:06.436 --> 19:09.189
This world is full
of uncivilized people.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.234
Don't pay them any attention.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.820
Again? From the top?

19:21.910 --> 19:24.830
So, the doctor has to
check for food poisoning.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.082
Good.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.252
Do you mind? I have
to send him a stool sample?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.004
Fuck off.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.924
Patient's name?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.509
Nitin Berry.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.890
Mr. Bhatia?

19:58.322 --> 20:00.115
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.202
Sir...

20:45.702 --> 20:46.828
this is shit.

20:49.998 --> 20:50.874
Thank you.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.002
Sisterfucker.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.569
New car?

21:19.861 --> 21:20.696
Yes.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.657
Very nice! Beauty, great color.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.741
Thank you, Mr. Jain.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.121
Mr. Tashi, I just wanted to remind
you that the rent is due next week.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.247
I know, Mr. Jain.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.498
Good. Good. Very good.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.375
It is just that it
was late last month.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.881
And the month before that also,
that's why.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385
You said you'll speak to
Mr. Maharaj about the dancing.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.178
Every night Bharatanatyam on our heads.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.346
Kathak.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.973
See, I spoke to him...

21:48.098 --> 21:50.225
and he said that he will
try and take his class early.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.560
That was last week.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.978
Really?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.740
-Hi.
-Hey.

22:04.865 --> 22:05.907
What's wrong with you?

22:06.199 --> 22:07.576
Bastard, I'm dying.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.703
Okay. And you?

22:10.037 --> 22:11.872
Meeting Ritu for a movie.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.832
'Return of Disco Fighter'

22:14.791 --> 22:16.043
Where are my pants?

22:16.418 --> 22:17.878
Okay, just hang on a second.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.171
Something I want
to talk to you about.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.423
-Two things.
-I don't know about that Ritu.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.717
That girl,
she doesn't give me a good feeling.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.052
Yeah, she's my girlfriend

22:25.135 --> 22:26.428
and she is only supposed to
give me a good feeling.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.096
You're my witness. I warned him.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.307
Listen, rent's due next week.

22:30.849 --> 22:31.850
I'd like to pay
it on time this month.

22:32.017 --> 22:32.893
Sure.

22:33.894 --> 22:34.853
Nitin?

22:34.978 --> 22:36.646
Yeah, I'm not paying rent anymore.

22:37.022 --> 22:37.856
Moron!

22:37.939 --> 22:38.857
You're moving out?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.275
No.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.527
You're not moving out and
you're not going to pay rent.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.196
How the fuck are you
going to manage that?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.364
Check this out.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.499
What the hell is this?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.626
It's a naked man lying
on top of a naked woman.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.044
It's called fucking.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.254
This is Manish, our landlord.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.465
Yeah, the fucking wife-cheater.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.966
And that's Leena.

23:05.133 --> 23:05.967
She's a whore.

23:06.093 --> 23:06.927
No.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.553
I thought she was sucking
his dick because she's

23:08.637 --> 23:10.222
really outgoing.
But, a whore you say, my God.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.265
Listen, if I wasn't sick,
I'd fucking give you one.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.350
How'd you get these?

23:13.558 --> 23:14.392
No, that's the wrong question.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.978
The right question is,
are we going to pay rent anymore?

23:17.312 --> 23:18.480
And the answer is?

23:20.357 --> 23:23.401
No. No more rent.
No more fucking rent.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.237
What are you talking about?

23:25.445 --> 23:27.864
I'm talking about a small business
transaction with our landlord.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.700
He gives us some money and
these pictures don't get to his wife.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.161
You're going to blackmail him?

23:33.411 --> 23:35.497
It's not blackmail.
It's a sign, from God.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.832
Oh, you're going to blackmail him.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.334
We're living with a criminal.
It's Nitin Sobhraj.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.045
Listen, I'm just the higher moral
authority in Manish's life.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.630
You're the higher moral
authority in his life?

23:43.713 --> 23:45.882
Yes, yes, and I'm asking
him to mend his evil ways.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.217
I'm not a benevolent God.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.426
You know what, don't tell
me anymore, alright?

23:48.510 --> 23:49.636
Because, when the cops
come to get you

23:49.719 --> 23:51.429
I don't want to be dragged
in as an accessory.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.182
Oh! An accessory?
Listen to him using big words.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
An earring is an accessory,
you pussy.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.854
Listen I've been in this
business for two years, nobody gets--

23:58.937 --> 24:00.730
I'm sorry, you've been
in this business for two years?

24:03.859 --> 24:05.068
Listen, I do all the work.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.654
You fuckers get to save rent money.
Everybody wins.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.751
And two?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.005
Two? I'm getting married.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.548
Yeah, we know that.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.301
No, getting married next month.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.303
Really, I thought this wasn't
happening till like, next year.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.389
Yeah, but then I thought,
what difference? Sooner the better.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.558
Right up till the moment
they chop his head off

24:36.975 --> 24:38.977
the goat thinks he's
going for a walk in the park.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.354
Bastard, you're just too negative.
I hate this attitude.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.315
Listen, this is great news.
Come here, give me a hug.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.649
Great news, man!

24:44.900 --> 24:46.359
Fucker, I was looking for these.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.737
Your ass is like
a solar eclipse, man.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.823
Listen, she's too hot, I was going
to marry her myself. But...

24:51.990 --> 24:52.866
you can have her.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.118
She's too sexy, you lucky bastard!

24:56.077 --> 24:57.454
He's moving out.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.165
You're moving out?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.501
Then why the fuck were
you going on about the rent?

25:03.710 --> 25:06.504
Disco Fighter.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.719
"Disco! Disco!"

25:13.929 --> 25:15.138
"Disco Fighter!"

25:16.848 --> 25:18.099
"Disco! Disco!"

25:19.726 --> 25:20.894
"Disco Fighter!"

25:22.854 --> 25:24.397
"Disco Fighter!"

25:39.788 --> 25:41.915
Tashi, you really should shave, baby.

25:50.757 --> 25:54.177
Hello? Menaka? Yes.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.763
Tashi? Tashi, get back in there!

25:56.846 --> 25:57.973
I know where it is.

25:58.556 --> 25:59.599
Okay, should I bring Nitin?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.518
I can't believe you!

26:02.102 --> 26:04.145
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, my God, this guy.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.939
Fucking buffoon.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.775
Baby, I've got to go.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.027
Look, it's work.
I swear I'll make it up to you, Okay?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.029
Just go, Tashi, just go.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.289
Thank you.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.625
Do you see her, right behind me?
Don't look, don't look.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.627
What about her?

26:27.836 --> 26:29.129
That's Kanika Tuli.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.298
I heard she's a lesbo.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.217
Really? Where'd you hear that?

26:34.301 --> 26:35.885
Oh, you know, here and there.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.557
Considering some of the men I've been
with, that doesn't sound half bad.

26:43.476 --> 26:44.352
Oh, come on.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.646
Don't tell me you've never
thought about being with a woman.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.773
No! Never!

26:50.817 --> 26:54.279
So, did you see Rajeev yet?
I think he's around.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.905
Nope.

26:56.072 --> 26:59.534
"...try understanding my emotions"

26:59.701 --> 27:00.535
Excuse me.

27:00.952 --> 27:01.786
Sure.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.540
"It's really important for me"

27:05.665 --> 27:07.000
"Sweety your love"

27:07.083 --> 27:09.169
"It's a like a gem for me"

27:09.294 --> 27:10.837
"Sweety your love"

27:10.962 --> 27:12.672
"Making me crazy"

27:12.797 --> 27:15.425
Do you see her? Don't look.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.511
That's Menaka Vashisht. She's a lesbo.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.096
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.307
So, what's the story?

27:22.682 --> 27:23.641
Story?

27:23.808 --> 27:24.684
Yeah, you know, you called me.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.311
Gave me the address,
told me to come over.

27:26.394 --> 27:29.439
Yeah, I know. I'm not that drunk. Yet.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.776
I didn't say anything about a story,
I just gave you the address.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.319
So I came here for nothing?

27:34.402 --> 27:37.155
No, to have a drink, have some fun.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.532
Tashi, stop working.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.242
I was in the middle of something.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.786
Couldn't have been that important.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.162
What?

27:44.371 --> 27:45.997
Why'd you pick up the phone then?

27:48.917 --> 27:51.169
I'm glad you're having fun.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.505
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
When you're sober.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.173
Tash, come on.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.966
Lover's spat?

27:57.801 --> 28:00.345
Rajeev, I'm not in the mood
for your bullshit, okay?

28:00.428 --> 28:01.846
So why don't you just leave?

28:02.472 --> 28:03.390
Make me.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.642
Listen, man. I don't know you, okay?
Do you mind?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.477
Yeah. I mind.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.395
What the fuck?

28:08.478 --> 28:09.979
-What's your problem, man?
-What did you just say?

28:10.188 --> 28:11.773
What the fuck?

28:11.856 --> 28:12.690
-Come on, say it again!
-Guys!

28:12.816 --> 28:13.650
Say it again, come on.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.194
Listen, man,
I'm not looking for trouble, alright?

28:16.903 --> 28:19.322
No, bitch! Trouble's looking for you.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.951
-Should've kept your mouth shut!
-Leave me alone!

28:23.034 --> 28:24.744
-Now mind your fucking business!
-You bastard!

28:24.828 --> 28:27.372
-Come here. You, come here--
-You fucking bastard!

28:27.455 --> 28:28.540
-You think, you can get away with this?
-Fucker!

28:28.623 --> 28:30.708
Nobody messes with
Rajeev Khanna and gets--

28:37.549 --> 28:39.467
Let's go! He has friends.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.029
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.865
Let me see that.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.200
That doesn't look so good.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.410
I'm fine.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.663
I'm really sorry.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.499
I just wanted you to loosen up,
have a good time.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.542
It's okay.

29:13.793 --> 29:14.836
What do you mean, loosen up?

29:14.961 --> 29:15.795
No, I didn't mean it like that.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.213
I am loose, okay?

29:18.047 --> 29:19.799
With friends, people who know me.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.801
People who don't feel the need
to drag me half-way across the city

29:21.885 --> 29:24.220
in the middle of the fucking night,
so I can loosen up.

29:24.804 --> 29:28.349
Don't be an asshole. I apologized.
I was just trying to be nice.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.811
-Where should I drop you off?
-Just wherever.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.150
-Fuck!
-Can't believe this guy!

29:37.275 --> 29:39.319
Hey! Hey bastard!

29:39.402 --> 29:40.487
I'll fucking kill you!

29:40.612 --> 29:42.030
-You bastard!
-Tashi, go, go, go!

29:42.113 --> 29:43.448
Son of a bitch!

29:43.531 --> 29:44.991
I'll fucking kill you!

29:45.366 --> 29:47.118
Go, go, go, go. Fuck.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.789
I'm going to fucking
shoot you like a dog!

29:50.955 --> 29:52.123
I'll kill you, you bitch!

29:54.000 --> 29:55.460
What's wrong with that crazy fuck?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.921
You bitch, you're done!

29:58.171 --> 30:00.924
"Sweety, I want your love"
-Shit!

30:01.382 --> 30:02.550
-You asshole!
-Asshole!

30:02.634 --> 30:03.968
Stop it, you fuck!

30:07.972 --> 30:09.808
"It's really important for me"

30:09.933 --> 30:11.351
"Sweety your love"

30:11.434 --> 30:13.102
"It's a gem for me..."

30:13.186 --> 30:15.396
-Stop the bloody car!
-You bastard!

30:15.480 --> 30:16.314
You bitch!

30:17.440 --> 30:18.733
-Asshole!
-Bloody hell!

30:18.817 --> 30:19.651
I'll fucking kill you!

30:19.734 --> 30:20.693
Fuck you!

30:20.944 --> 30:21.986
"Sweety your love"

30:22.111 --> 30:26.407
"I want your love"

30:30.745 --> 30:31.955
Fuck.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.582
Hang on.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.711
Stop, sisterfucker!

30:38.878 --> 30:40.088
I'll kill you, you bastard!

30:40.213 --> 30:41.589
Get after him!

30:43.424 --> 30:45.051
Fuck, where the fuck do we go?

30:45.176 --> 30:48.680
"Sweety, I want your love"

30:48.805 --> 30:51.140
"Sweety, I want your love"

30:51.224 --> 30:52.100
Park it!

30:52.308 --> 30:56.688
"Sweety, I want your love"

30:57.063 --> 30:58.857
Bastard!

30:59.899 --> 31:02.652
"The reason of my happiness is your love"

31:02.735 --> 31:04.153
Come on, come on.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.989
"Sweety your love"

31:06.072 --> 31:07.282
Come on, quick!

31:08.157 --> 31:09.242
Oh shit!

31:10.118 --> 31:12.328
"Your love is my need"

31:13.121 --> 31:14.038
There he is!

31:14.122 --> 31:15.415
Stop, you fucker!

31:15.498 --> 31:18.459
Stop. Stop, you bastard!

31:18.918 --> 31:20.336
Stop.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.010
-But which one?
-Fuck it, let's go!

31:37.186 --> 31:38.271
509.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.648
That's fine, that's fine.
Don't worry about it.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.733
Okay, ma'am.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.694
-Bathroom? Is it done?
-Yes ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.612
Thank you.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.322
Thank you, sir.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.250
Fuck! My car.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.419
My brand new car.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.546
Who's the asshole?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.798
My husband.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.012
Ex-husband,
as soon as the divorce papers show up.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.517
I can't believe he took a shot at me.
Geez! Where'd you find him?

32:16.726 --> 32:19.270
Oh, you know. Arranged marriage.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.148
Parents forced me.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.067
Really?

32:24.901 --> 32:27.737
No. He was my boyfriend in school.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.906
I actually ran away
from home to marry him.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.408
I fought with my parents.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.661
You know how to pick them.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.955
Sitting here with you.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.920
I'm going to get some coffee.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.129
You want some?

32:45.463 --> 32:46.506
You can't just do that. That's not--

32:46.589 --> 32:48.424
Anyone who can afford
to stay at this hotel

32:48.508 --> 32:49.926
can afford to
buy us a cup of coffee.

32:50.009 --> 32:51.427
Cappuccino, okay?

32:51.636 --> 32:52.887
What, you do this on a regular basis?

32:53.262 --> 32:56.474
No, just on days I get
shot at by my ex-husband.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.602
Hi, I'm calling from room 509.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.105
Can you please
send up two cappuccinos?

33:03.523 --> 33:04.524
Hold on.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.609
Would you like something to eat?

33:10.488 --> 33:12.824
No, just the coffees. Thank you.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.575
This is wrong.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.828
You need to fucking lighten up.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.715
Yes, baby!
Yes, a little harder!

33:31.592 --> 33:32.719
Excuse us!

33:32.844 --> 33:34.637
Oh my God! Yes, yes!

33:34.721 --> 33:36.973
Oh! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

33:37.056 --> 33:37.890
Yes, yes, yes!

33:38.182 --> 33:40.476
Yes, yes, yes!

33:40.560 --> 33:42.562
Like a horse! In the back!

33:42.645 --> 33:44.439
In the back! In the back!

33:44.522 --> 33:47.608
Slightly baby! Like a horse!

33:48.651 --> 33:51.195
Oh my God!
More! More, in the back!

33:51.279 --> 33:52.613
Come on.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.458
I could've sworn that was our room.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.836
Frank, I hope this isn't Alzheimer's.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.838
Louise, the key worked!

34:08.963 --> 34:11.674
Mr. and Mrs. Eggen, I have your coffee.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.259
We didn't order any coffee.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.991
Thanks for the lift.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.703
And I'd be happy
to pay for your window.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.623
It's all right.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.333
You didn't shoot it.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.168
'Night.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.174
Did you put the buckets out?

35:36.050 --> 35:38.761
Bastard, I'm dying.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.452
Man, did you drink all my juice?

36:07.790 --> 36:08.958
Yeah.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.544
There were like 3-4 cartons in there.

36:12.587 --> 36:13.671
I know.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.174
You don't even like orange juice.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.177
Sometimes I do.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.428
Man!

36:20.928 --> 36:22.346
I'll buy you some more.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.640
Damn right you'll buy me some more.
You--

36:30.229 --> 36:34.025
Did you wash your ass with my juice?

36:36.694 --> 36:38.487
Bastard, I told you
I'll buy you some more.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.656
My fucking ass cheeks
are stuck together.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.121
I can never drink orange juice again.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.582
Yes, Mom.

36:49.665 --> 36:52.293
Yes, how many times are you
going to tell me the same thing?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.377
OK, Mom, and listen.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.880
Please do not forget to pick
up my Lehenga from the designer.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.340
I just know that guy.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.008
He will not be done on time.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.301
Yes.

37:00.551 --> 37:04.513
Yeah, Mom. Okay.
Okay, bye. Love you, bye.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.433
Hey, baby. Hi.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.101
What?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.645
What happened to you?

37:12.980 --> 37:13.814
Work.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.774
Work?

37:15.024 --> 37:17.568
Work? They don't pay
you enough to get killed.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.622
My dad gives you a brand new car and

37:29.747 --> 37:31.457
this is what you do to it, Tashi?

37:35.628 --> 37:37.296
You're going to miss your flight.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.066
-This is it, right?
-Yes.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.652
Do not disturb.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.038
Who is it?

38:13.207 --> 38:14.542
Sir, laundry.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.627
No, thanks.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.925
Laundry?

38:23.551 --> 38:24.844
You idiot.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.345
Move.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.896
Hold on.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.523
Yes, sir?

38:38.190 --> 38:39.233
Which room is this for?

38:39.358 --> 38:40.526
507, sir.

38:40.901 --> 38:41.777
I'll take it.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.446
No, sir, I can't do that.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.239
I have to deliver the food myself.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.826
See, he's my friend.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.829
It's his birthday,
we want to surprise him.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.164
Yes sir, I understand, sir.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.457
But, it's hotel...

38:54.749 --> 38:55.583
policy.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.293
R. Balachander.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.422
If there's a problem,
I'll talk to your manager.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.631
But, sir.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.804
Here, buy something for the kids.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.890
Sir, I'm not married.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.060
For yourself then?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.437
No, sir. I can't do that, sir.

39:16.645 --> 39:19.190
I have to deliver the food myself,
for reasons of quality.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.736
You have to deliver it?

39:24.570 --> 39:25.571
Yes, sir.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.157
For the reasons of quality?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.533
Yes, sir.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.369
Take it.

39:39.835 --> 39:40.836
Ready, sir?

39:44.090 --> 39:44.965
Who is it?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.093
Room service. Sir, your lunch.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.430
Yeah, you can come in.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.353
And happy birthday, sir.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.563
Sorry, but it's not my birthday.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.656
What the fuck?

40:09.532 --> 40:10.408
Surprise.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.493
Yeah, what are you doing here?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.538
Delivering your food, man.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.374
Unlike you, we make our deliveries.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.920
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.088
Bunty.

40:25.798 --> 40:26.632
Hey, easy!

40:27.591 --> 40:28.968
This was a new shirt, man.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.263
-Even dry cleaning won't get that out.
-Balls.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.348
Just got it from the tailor yesterday.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.700
Where is my package?

40:53.242 --> 40:56.787
I sent it, like every time.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.706
But I didn't get it.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.375
So, where is it?

41:01.709 --> 41:03.002
I brought it in...

41:03.294 --> 41:05.838
and gave it to the courier,
like every time!

41:11.302 --> 41:12.928
There was this new girl.

41:15.681 --> 41:16.765
New girl?

41:16.891 --> 41:17.725
Yeah.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.769
My regular girl was sick, so...

41:20.853 --> 41:22.855
she told me her
friend could help us...

41:23.147 --> 41:26.275
Who could help us out, for free.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.485
Only this time.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.739
The new girl didn't
know what she was carrying.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.491
She didn't know!

41:33.908 --> 41:34.867
Yeah.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.076
I'm sure.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.581
Search the room.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.549
Sisterfuckers!
What is this, a wedding?

41:55.471 --> 41:59.391
Arup! This is very nice, Arup.
Very nice.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.852
The client also liked it very much.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.856
Only thing, they felt that
the banana is smiling too much.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.358
Too happy.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.070
Why? He's about to get eaten.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.279
What could be wrong?

42:13.906 --> 42:15.407
You want me to make him sad?

42:15.491 --> 42:17.743
Yes, not too much.
About seven percent.

42:40.808 --> 42:41.850
Anything for me?

42:43.102 --> 42:45.688
No, nothing. I'm going to take a bath.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.189
You just took a bath.

42:48.315 --> 42:51.068
It's really hot. I'm really hot.

42:51.485 --> 42:53.612
I feel like taking a bath again.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.247
"Cruel, beloved"

43:03.330 --> 43:05.708
"Come a little closer"

43:05.874 --> 43:08.711
"I am a firecracker"

43:09.712 --> 43:11.880
Send 10,000 rupees to P.O Box
number 3452, New Delhi - 110007

43:11.964 --> 43:14.091
on the first of every month.
No police.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.804
Are you done?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.389
No, no.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.499
Mr. Tashi?

43:49.376 --> 43:50.711
Mr. Ni--

43:53.714 --> 43:54.882
Nitin?

43:59.928 --> 44:00.846
Nothing.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.893
I swear I don't have it.
You got to believe me now.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.438
This girl, she must've messed up.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.196
Give me her number.

44:18.113 --> 44:18.947
What?

44:19.573 --> 44:20.783
Her phone number.

44:22.493 --> 44:27.373
It's 9-8-6...

44:29.249 --> 44:31.669
7-6-6...

44:32.419 --> 44:35.297
No. 7-6-5...

44:35.589 --> 44:37.841
1-9-9-0.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.264
Gupta Stationary Mart. Hello?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.976
No, no. I must've mixed it up,
I mean...

44:48.477 --> 44:50.604
-Bunty.
-No, I... Don't!

44:51.897 --> 44:53.357
Don't!

44:54.608 --> 44:57.236
No, no!

44:57.611 --> 45:00.406
Why should I be here
if I want to cheat you?

45:00.489 --> 45:02.491
Because you don't know me.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.034
What's that?

45:04.284 --> 45:06.078
It is something to
clear your brain, man.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.415
What are you doing?

45:09.498 --> 45:10.332
Number.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.251
Number?

45:12.501 --> 45:15.379
9-8-7...
No, 6!

45:15.712 --> 45:17.881
7-6-5

45:17.965 --> 45:19.091
1-6...

45:19.508 --> 45:21.176
8...
Fuck!

45:21.260 --> 45:23.262
Number is 6...

45:24.638 --> 45:26.348
1-9-9-0. No!

45:26.598 --> 45:29.893
1-9-1-1-9-0!
1-1-9-0!

45:30.060 --> 45:32.396
Please! Put it off, please!

45:32.688 --> 45:33.522
Get it off!

45:33.605 --> 45:35.023
Hello, you've reached Soniya.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.233
-Please, put it out!
-Please leave

45:36.358 --> 45:39.111
-a message after the beep. Bye.
-Please put it out.

45:44.032 --> 45:44.950
Sorry.

45:45.325 --> 45:48.078
Leave her a message
to call back urgently.

45:55.544 --> 45:58.255
And now, I'm calling her again.

45:58.755 --> 46:02.301
But this time, leave a
proper message, okay?

46:02.384 --> 46:03.427
Yeah.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.763
And also, call the room service,
order some food.

46:07.347 --> 46:08.432
What do you idiots want to eat?

46:10.559 --> 46:11.477
Hey.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.271
What happened,
where were you yesterday?

46:14.354 --> 46:15.606
Arup, what are you doing here?

46:15.689 --> 46:16.773
Ritu, who is it?

46:16.940 --> 46:18.275
Nobody, Mom.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.235
Arup, you shouldn't be here.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.403
What's going on?

46:22.779 --> 46:23.822
Hey, guys.

46:24.490 --> 46:25.949
Ritu, your friend?

46:27.326 --> 46:28.785
Yeah, a friend.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.746
Ritu's friends are my friends.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.623
Arup, this is Vivek.

46:32.789 --> 46:34.166
He's a computer engineer in Canada.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.793
Hey, nice to meet you, dude.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.337
I hope you're coming for the wedding.

46:39.546 --> 46:40.380
Wedding?

46:40.672 --> 46:41.548
He doesn't know?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.050
I was just about to tell him.

46:43.258 --> 46:45.219
Actually, Arup's here
to pick up his stuff.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.553
He's a cartoonist.

46:47.262 --> 46:48.096
I'll be back.

46:49.348 --> 46:50.390
A cartoonist?

46:50.557 --> 46:53.977
Like Chacha Choudhry?

46:56.271 --> 46:57.981
Yeah, like Chacha Choudhry.

46:58.065 --> 46:59.316
That's, that's funny.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.945
Vivek, your tea is getting cold.

47:03.070 --> 47:05.072
All right, yeah.
Hey...

47:05.197 --> 47:06.406
Good to see you, dude.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.783
Hey!

47:08.033 --> 47:09.201
Old jungle saying...

47:09.451 --> 47:11.995
"Phantom fist is quicker than the eye"

47:12.287 --> 47:13.747
See you at the wedding.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.627
Vivek, come here. Your tea's getting cold.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.089
When were you planning to tell me?

47:22.506 --> 47:23.799
Arup, it doesn't matter.

47:23.924 --> 47:25.259
In a month, I'm moving to Canada.

47:25.342 --> 47:27.094
Ritu, your tea is getting cold.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.887
You should go now, Arup. Please.

47:29.137 --> 47:30.639
Good luck with your cartooning.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.444
Ritu weds Vivek.

47:44.528 --> 47:48.824
The bride and groom
may now exchange garlands.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.993
"All auspiciousness to Lord Vishnu--"

47:51.076 --> 47:53.203
Stop!
This marriage cannot happen!

48:02.754 --> 48:04.381
"Disco Fighter!"

48:06.883 --> 48:08.594
This girl has given me a blow-job.

48:08.885 --> 48:11.680
Blow-job!

48:13.265 --> 48:18.812
And because I am a 21st century man,
I have given her oral pleasure also.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.483
Oh my God!
Are you alright?

48:24.943 --> 48:25.902
Shameless girl!

48:26.069 --> 48:28.238
You've disgraced the family name!

48:28.322 --> 48:30.032
Get out of my sight!

48:47.299 --> 48:52.012
"The trivial things you troubled me with"

48:53.388 --> 48:57.934
"Made me a fool dancing to your tune"

48:59.144 --> 49:04.316
"Go, go, go
Go to hell"

49:05.025 --> 49:08.445
"Go, go, go!
All I want to say is"

49:08.528 --> 49:11.198
"Get lost witch!"

49:11.490 --> 49:12.866
"Witch..."

49:12.949 --> 49:13.867
"Sitar!"

49:26.171 --> 49:30.801
"Go, go, go
Everybody, get lost witch!"

49:30.884 --> 49:32.344
"Get lost witch!"

49:32.469 --> 49:33.970
"Get lost witch!"

49:34.388 --> 49:35.806
"Witch!"

50:18.390 --> 50:23.186
"If you don't care for me,
Then I care a damn"

50:24.563 --> 50:26.815
"To hell with you"

50:27.149 --> 50:30.569
"What can one possibly do to me?"

50:31.361 --> 50:34.698
"Go, go, go..."

50:35.657 --> 50:39.244
"Get lost witch"

50:41.121 --> 50:43.540
You have two voice messages.

50:48.628 --> 50:51.423
Hi, Soniya. It's Vladimir...

50:51.506 --> 50:53.383
I want you to call
back as soon as possible.

50:53.467 --> 50:56.052
It's very urgent, so if you can do that.
Thank you very much.

51:09.941 --> 51:10.776
Hello?

51:10.859 --> 51:13.737
Hello, Vladimir.
It's Soniya, I got your message.

51:14.613 --> 51:15.655
Good, good, good.

51:15.864 --> 51:18.492
I want to ask you about
the package you have to deliver.

51:18.992 --> 51:20.118
Did you deliver it?

51:21.119 --> 51:24.206
You know, actually, I didn't.
But I gave it to a friend to deliver.

51:24.331 --> 51:26.750
I had to do some
shopping before the flight.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.336
Are you crazy?

51:29.795 --> 51:32.172
After I told you exactly what to do...

51:32.672 --> 51:33.840
You think this is a joke?

51:34.007 --> 51:35.425
You think this is a picnic...

51:35.717 --> 51:36.885
That we are on a picnic?

51:37.010 --> 51:40.388
You are so fucking stupid!

51:40.472 --> 51:41.431
God!

51:41.640 --> 51:42.766
Hello?

51:46.394 --> 51:47.437
Well done.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.740
Hello, you've reached Soniya.

51:58.949 --> 52:02.285
Please leave me a message
after the beep, bye.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.664
Vladimir.

52:15.590 --> 52:17.634
-Hello, yes?
-Hello, Miss Soniya?

52:17.759 --> 52:18.802
Now who's this?

52:18.969 --> 52:21.221
Hi, Miss Soniya,
this is Vladimir's supervisor.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.807
I'm calling to say
sorry for his behavior.

52:23.932 --> 52:26.351
He's a very rude man, okay?
Very rude.

52:26.434 --> 52:28.144
I only did this as a favor to him,
you know.

52:28.228 --> 52:29.479
Because he's a friend of a friend.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.481
I helped him out, and look at this!

52:32.190 --> 52:33.024
I mean...

52:33.108 --> 52:34.442
You're right, you're right.

52:34.901 --> 52:37.320
I'll definitely take
some action against him.

52:37.529 --> 52:39.114
Some very strict action.

52:40.365 --> 52:43.535
By the way, where's that
package you had to deliver?

52:44.202 --> 52:46.830
Actually, I'm surprised
it hasn't been delivered.

52:46.955 --> 52:49.791
I gave it to a friend.
He's usually very good at these things.

52:51.084 --> 52:54.170
Something must have happened,
you know, we all are busy people.

52:55.255 --> 52:58.216
Why don't you give me his address,
I mean, I'll have it picked up.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.259
Are you sure?

53:00.093 --> 53:01.136
No problem at all.

53:01.678 --> 53:03.430
Where should I write, on my hand?

53:03.638 --> 53:05.307
Yeah, sorry?

53:07.058 --> 53:08.059
Yeah.

53:12.814 --> 53:14.107
What's his name?

53:20.655 --> 53:22.073
What the fuck?

53:28.455 --> 53:29.664
Who's this?

53:30.540 --> 53:31.374
Tashi.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.002
So you're Tashi?

53:34.085 --> 53:35.211
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

53:35.337 --> 53:36.630
Hey, barrister Vinod.

53:37.088 --> 53:39.132
I ask the questions here.

53:39.341 --> 53:40.508
Calm down.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.178
So you're not Tashi?

53:43.303 --> 53:45.555
No, sir. I told you...

53:45.889 --> 53:47.432
May I get down now?

53:49.768 --> 53:51.144
Where's my package?

53:51.519 --> 53:52.395
Package?

54:09.245 --> 54:11.122
Is this basketball
that they are having fun?

54:12.332 --> 54:13.917
Enough, you fools.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.799
A girl called Soniya
gave you a package.

54:21.925 --> 54:23.051
Where is it?

54:26.638 --> 54:27.597
I don't know.

54:27.889 --> 54:28.765
Really?

54:29.015 --> 54:30.976
Ask the guy who dropped it off.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.310
He isn't here.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.729
Sisterfucker! What is this, a joke?

54:34.813 --> 54:36.731
No, no, no.
He's right.

54:37.482 --> 54:38.650
I dropped it off.

54:40.485 --> 54:41.903
You dropped it off?

54:42.570 --> 54:44.155
He's saying you're not even here.

54:44.447 --> 54:46.783
I think I'll just beat
you guys a little more.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.868
Sir, please listen to me.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.871
He gave it to someone to drop it off...

54:51.955 --> 54:54.040
and that guy, he gave it to me to...

54:54.207 --> 54:55.834
Hang on, hang on.

54:57.002 --> 54:58.211
You're not Tashi.

54:59.587 --> 55:00.422
He is.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.758
He got the package,
he gave it to someone else

55:03.883 --> 55:06.344
and he gave it to you,
and you dropped it off.

55:07.971 --> 55:08.805
Yeah.

55:10.515 --> 55:11.891
Then why didn't you say so?

55:12.851 --> 55:14.853
Sir, you didn't ask.

55:27.657 --> 55:29.784
Okay, I'm you asking now. Where is it?

55:30.702 --> 55:35.290
I dropped it off at this place or shop,
Indian Handicrafts or something.

55:35.373 --> 55:38.793
You dropped off a can of
shit at Indian Handicrafts.

55:39.419 --> 55:40.378
Where's my package?

55:40.545 --> 55:42.213
No, sir. Shit?

55:43.048 --> 55:44.174
Really?

55:44.340 --> 55:46.092
-Are you sure?
-Am I sure?

55:46.176 --> 55:48.053
-Ask me again.
-You're probably right.

55:48.678 --> 55:50.972
You're absolutely right.
There must've been a mix up.

55:51.056 --> 55:55.393
Mix-up? Sisterfucker!
I've had it with this!

55:56.853 --> 55:59.564
If I have to ask you one more time.

55:59.647 --> 56:01.733
I'm going to fucking kill you.

56:07.072 --> 56:07.906
Package?

56:08.782 --> 56:12.410
Doctor, it's at the doctor's office.
Please.

56:13.953 --> 56:14.788
Bunty.

56:20.085 --> 56:20.919
Done?

56:21.086 --> 56:21.920
Better?

56:22.087 --> 56:23.880
Thank God, you were there, otherwise...

56:24.089 --> 56:25.423
Forget it, man.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.716
Let's go.

56:29.302 --> 56:30.470
Mr. Nitin?

56:31.096 --> 56:31.930
Who is next?

56:32.764 --> 56:33.765
Mr. Nitin.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.356
Your friend dropped this off.

56:42.148 --> 56:44.526
My friend? Why?

56:48.613 --> 56:49.864
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

56:51.699 --> 56:53.159
Dr. Nirmal

57:18.435 --> 57:20.228
What do you know about this guy?

57:20.937 --> 57:22.897
Nothing. He's dead.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.692
Sir, may I get down now?

57:25.942 --> 57:27.652
I know he's dead.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.199
But who did the flower arrangement?

57:33.324 --> 57:36.661
Sir, if I could just get down,
I'll answer all your questions.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.998
My roommate took them.

57:40.623 --> 57:43.293
-Him?
-No. My other roommate.

57:43.501 --> 57:44.961
His photographer.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.006
His photographer?

57:49.215 --> 57:52.260
There are morons running around the
city photographing dead guys for him?

57:52.343 --> 57:54.804
No sir, actually, he's a...

57:56.556 --> 57:57.474
journalist.

58:10.862 --> 58:11.696
Thank you very much.

58:11.988 --> 58:12.822
I really--

58:12.906 --> 58:15.492
Forget it, man.
You're like a stuck record.

58:15.575 --> 58:18.620
You would've done
the same for me, right?

58:19.787 --> 58:20.622
Right.

58:21.998 --> 58:23.082
Okay. Got to go.

58:23.166 --> 58:24.000
What happened?

58:24.292 --> 58:25.919
You're not going home?

58:26.085 --> 58:26.920
No, man.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.379
Have to meet my brother.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.672
You have a brother?

58:47.607 --> 58:48.566
Hey, guys.

58:49.484 --> 58:51.194
You must be the photojournalist.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.825
Welcome. We've been waiting for you.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.369
Where the hell were you?

59:02.121 --> 59:04.999
Park your ass over there.

59:05.583 --> 59:06.501
Go.

59:47.500 --> 59:48.918
First class.

59:52.213 --> 59:53.256
Very good.

59:54.215 --> 59:55.258
Finish them.

59:56.217 --> 59:57.510
Wait a minute.
Finish them?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.554
Why? You got everything you want.
No, no, no!

59:59.929 --> 1:00:01.764
-Arup!
-Back off!

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:03.349
-Arup!
-Hold him!

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:09.939
You fucking idiot!

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:11.941
Nobody can hear a
thing in this racket.

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:17.238
-I'll take it off!
-You fuckhead, give me that.

1:00:26.247 --> 1:00:27.624
Master!

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:31.044
What happened?
Careful!

1:00:31.169 --> 1:00:33.004
Don't panic!

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:36.090
Go on, help her! Careful.

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:39.302
Don't worry, don't panic!

1:00:59.405 --> 1:01:00.615
Shit! Shit!

1:01:01.032 --> 1:01:01.866
Fuck.

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:12.502
Arup!

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:14.128
Arup?

1:01:15.713 --> 1:01:17.548
Arup, come on, man!

1:01:17.882 --> 1:01:19.050
Hurry, c'mon. Get up!

1:01:28.184 --> 1:01:29.185
Disco Fighter.

1:01:31.896 --> 1:01:34.482
Fuck. Shit! Come on, come on.

1:01:36.109 --> 1:01:37.068
You okay?

1:01:38.319 --> 1:01:40.738
Nitin, come on!

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.410
"Run! Run!"

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:47.245
Wait, wait!

1:01:47.870 --> 1:01:50.081
"Run! Run!"

1:01:50.164 --> 1:01:54.210
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:01:54.377 --> 1:01:58.464
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:01:58.548 --> 1:02:02.176
"Here it comes,
Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:03.845
What are you doing? Come on, Arup!

1:02:03.928 --> 1:02:07.724
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!
Here it comes"

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:11.769
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1:02:11.894 --> 1:02:14.897
"Run! Run!"

1:02:17.191 --> 1:02:18.151
Hey, stop!

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:22.029
Fuck.

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:29.120
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:02:29.245 --> 1:02:33.499
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:02:33.583 --> 1:02:39.046
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!
Here it comes"

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:44.802
Phool Chand Jain.

1:03:06.407 --> 1:03:07.241
This...

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:11.037
Is this the tie I gave you?

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:15.750
Yes.

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:17.543
Snacks are ready!

1:03:19.045 --> 1:03:20.588
Don't touch anything.

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:22.799
God knows what diseases
you're carrying.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:30.306
Are you waiting for the
snacks to be served?

1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:35.019
No, I'll get going.

1:03:39.232 --> 1:03:40.817
Bharat Petroleum.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:51.369
They shaved your head
before hanging you?

1:03:53.871 --> 1:03:54.789
No.

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:55.873
What?

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.043
No.

1:03:59.418 --> 1:04:00.837
So how come you're bald?

1:04:03.339 --> 1:04:04.298
I did.

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:05.424
You did?

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.718
What is this,
fucking Mill on the Floss?

1:04:08.678 --> 1:04:10.054
What the hell just happened?

1:04:10.721 --> 1:04:12.014
Where the fuck are we going?

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:20.231
Can we come in?

1:04:25.236 --> 1:04:26.904
Delhi Times.

1:04:59.270 --> 1:05:01.147
I'm sorry, I picked them up.

1:05:02.273 --> 1:05:04.650
How can you just leave a bunch of
diamonds lying around?

1:05:05.109 --> 1:05:06.068
I wasn't thinking.

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:07.236
But now I am.

1:05:07.361 --> 1:05:09.739
I think let's just return them,
walk away from this whole thing.

1:05:09.822 --> 1:05:10.907
We can't.

1:05:11.407 --> 1:05:12.575
What, we'll just...

1:05:12.867 --> 1:05:15.036
They tried to kill us
after they got them back.

1:05:15.536 --> 1:05:16.370
What?

1:05:16.454 --> 1:05:17.955
They tried to kill us
after they got them back.

1:05:19.457 --> 1:05:20.458
Too late to walk away.

1:05:23.169 --> 1:05:27.048
We can't just sell them and run,
I mean, where do we...

1:05:27.173 --> 1:05:28.215
Sorry, Aunty.

1:05:29.508 --> 1:05:32.011
Where do we go?
Our lives are here.

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:40.478
Why can't we just go to the police?

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:42.313
Soniya will get into trouble.

1:05:43.230 --> 1:05:44.190
She'll get into trouble?

1:05:44.273 --> 1:05:45.358
-This is all her fault.
-Hello, this is Soniya.

1:05:45.441 --> 1:05:47.443
What the fuck has she been doing,
hanging out with fucking psychos?

1:05:47.526 --> 1:05:50.029
Leave me a message
after the beep, bye.

1:05:51.155 --> 1:05:54.116
And I know this is your dowry, man,
but its is an ugly fucking ugly car, okay!

1:05:54.241 --> 1:05:57.036
When a donkey fucks a rickshaw,
this is what you get.

1:05:58.537 --> 1:06:05.586
"People tend to be cheated in this world"

1:06:06.128 --> 1:06:12.718
"They tend to lose their hearts
Through their eyes"

1:06:13.636 --> 1:06:14.845
"In this world..."

1:06:14.929 --> 1:06:16.013
Three lakhs.

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:19.475
"...tend to be cheated in this world"

1:06:19.684 --> 1:06:20.893
Three lakhs.

1:06:21.018 --> 1:06:23.771
"They tend to lose their hearts..."

1:06:24.021 --> 1:06:24.897
Three lakhs?

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:25.898
Final offer.

1:06:26.023 --> 1:06:27.608
"...through their eyes"

1:06:29.777 --> 1:06:30.611
Okay.

1:06:30.987 --> 1:06:32.530
Good, very good.

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:40.162
There's 30 diamonds here,
so the total is 90 lakhs.

1:06:40.287 --> 1:06:42.081
Come back in half an hour.

1:06:42.289 --> 1:06:44.166
Till then, I'll arrange for the cash.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:47.753
Sorry, sorry. Three lakhs each?

1:06:51.465 --> 1:06:52.299
Three lakhs each.

1:06:52.466 --> 1:06:53.384
See, guys...

1:06:53.467 --> 1:06:55.261
this is my final offer.

1:06:56.053 --> 1:06:57.346
No bargaining.

1:06:58.264 --> 1:06:59.932
Take it or leave it.

1:07:00.016 --> 1:07:01.559
No, no, no.

1:07:02.101 --> 1:07:03.060
It's fine.

1:07:04.437 --> 1:07:05.312
90 lakhs.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:07.565
It's okay.

1:07:20.369 --> 1:07:21.620
I'll go to Patna.

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:23.080
I'm gone five years.

1:07:23.414 --> 1:07:25.124
No, I'll go to Kashmir.

1:07:25.249 --> 1:07:27.293
Nobody will look there.

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:30.880
What are you doing?

1:07:31.005 --> 1:07:32.715
I'm just, just checking.

1:07:32.965 --> 1:07:35.176
Saw this movie once, cash on top

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:37.303
and underneath they had
stuffed with all fucking newspaper.

1:07:37.428 --> 1:07:38.721
This is, this is all cash.

1:07:38.846 --> 1:07:40.723
Nice guy, that Mr. Adlakha.

1:07:41.015 --> 1:07:42.141
Where are you going to go?

1:07:42.808 --> 1:07:44.602
-Staying right here.
-What?

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:46.854
They'll, they'll find you, man.

1:07:46.937 --> 1:07:49.815
Yeah, they'll find me, they'll beat me,
and I'll tell them you're in Patna.

1:07:50.024 --> 1:07:51.317
Bastard.

1:07:53.944 --> 1:07:55.071
Give me the phone.

1:08:04.205 --> 1:08:05.039
Hello?

1:08:05.164 --> 1:08:09.001
Bannerjee, you fucking hack!

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:10.044
Hello?

1:08:10.127 --> 1:08:13.005
You blot on every
Bong art director in the business!

1:08:13.297 --> 1:08:14.173
I quit!

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:15.841
You talentless whore. You--

1:08:25.142 --> 1:08:26.519
-Talk.
-Talk.

1:08:26.852 --> 1:08:27.770
Talk!

1:08:28.437 --> 1:08:30.606
By about 11 percent and...

1:08:35.319 --> 1:08:36.153
Hello?

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:37.655
-Bannerjee.
-Bannerjee.

1:08:37.738 --> 1:08:39.657
-Hack!
-You... fucking hack!

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:42.368
Blot on every Bong
art director in the business!

1:08:42.451 --> 1:08:43.619
-What?
-I quit, I quit!

1:08:43.702 --> 1:08:45.996
I quit, you talentless whore.

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:48.082
Goddammit, who is this?

1:08:48.165 --> 1:08:49.542
It's Arup, you dumb fuck.

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:50.709
I quit!

1:08:57.007 --> 1:08:58.467
You're so fucked!

1:09:02.638 --> 1:09:04.306
You're a dick, man.

1:09:05.850 --> 1:09:07.518
-Yeah?
-Tashi!

1:09:07.935 --> 1:09:13.065
I want the diamonds back, in one hour.
Room 507, Hotel Raj Palace.

1:09:13.190 --> 1:09:15.734
Or I'll send her back by parcel post.

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:22.867
What?

1:09:23.033 --> 1:09:24.076
Who is it?

1:09:27.746 --> 1:09:28.747
They've got Soniya.

1:09:28.831 --> 1:09:30.624
They, who they?

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:33.127
We have to take the diamonds back.

1:09:33.711 --> 1:09:35.337
We have to return the money and
take the diamonds back.

1:09:35.462 --> 1:09:36.797
-What?
-Take the money back?

1:09:36.881 --> 1:09:38.382
I just quit my job.

1:09:39.049 --> 1:09:41.051
No, you're right,
we have to do the right...

1:09:41.177 --> 1:09:43.888
They didn't recognize me,
I can always tell them it wasn't... Crap!

1:09:43.971 --> 1:09:45.472
But we take the diamonds back,
they kill us.

1:09:45.556 --> 1:09:46.807
Wasn't that the problem to begin with?

1:09:46.974 --> 1:09:48.392
-We don't have a choice.
-We don't have a choice?

1:09:48.475 --> 1:09:50.144
What, we're just going to go back there
and get killed?

1:09:50.227 --> 1:09:51.312
That's the plan?
To go back there and get--

1:09:51.395 --> 1:09:53.314
Fuck, man! Will you shut the fuck up?

1:10:03.574 --> 1:10:05.993
I hate your fucking girlfriend, man.

1:10:09.955 --> 1:10:12.458
"I was up all night..."

1:10:12.750 --> 1:10:14.752
No problem.

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:18.005
Pay me back and take them.

1:10:18.255 --> 1:10:19.548
They're yours, after all.

1:10:19.715 --> 1:10:22.051
"...they tend to lose their hearts"

1:10:22.426 --> 1:10:23.260
How much is this?

1:10:23.469 --> 1:10:25.971
The 90 lakhs you gave us, all of it.

1:10:26.555 --> 1:10:27.556
How many do you want to buy?

1:10:29.141 --> 1:10:30.059
All of them.

1:10:30.351 --> 1:10:31.185
Oh...

1:10:32.269 --> 1:10:34.271
That'll be double then.

1:10:35.731 --> 1:10:39.902
Look, I am giving back all the
90 lakhs that you gave us.

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:42.029
Please, just return our diamonds.

1:10:47.409 --> 1:10:52.289
The guys who sold me the diamonds

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:55.626
had no idea of their value.

1:10:56.085 --> 1:10:58.545
But I did. That's why double.

1:10:59.713 --> 1:11:01.674
Look, I'm begging you.

1:11:02.216 --> 1:11:03.759
It's a matter of life and death.

1:11:04.009 --> 1:11:05.344
My friend...

1:11:05.511 --> 1:11:08.097
I've heard these sob stories before.

1:11:08.430 --> 1:11:12.434
I'm running a business, not a charity.

1:11:12.518 --> 1:11:14.937
Somebody will die, okay,
you understand?

1:11:15.229 --> 1:11:17.022
We were here half-an-hour ago,
nothing has changed.

1:11:17.106 --> 1:11:18.482
This is my final offer.

1:11:19.275 --> 1:11:20.109
Double.

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:22.278
Tashi, no, no!

1:11:23.112 --> 1:11:25.948
Throw him out!

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:29.451
Throw the motherfucking bastard out!

1:11:34.373 --> 1:11:35.582
Where are we going?

1:11:35.874 --> 1:11:36.709
Times of India.

1:11:37.710 --> 1:11:38.961
For what?

1:11:39.211 --> 1:11:40.212
I have a plan.

1:11:40.296 --> 1:11:41.839
Drag me half-way across the city?

1:11:41.922 --> 1:11:43.924
I only do that for
people who know me.

1:11:44.008 --> 1:11:46.927
For friends, and in the
middle of the fucking day!

1:11:47.469 --> 1:11:48.554
I have a deadline.

1:11:49.388 --> 1:11:50.222
Trust me.

1:11:50.681 --> 1:11:51.932
So do I.

1:11:58.939 --> 1:12:00.482
This is the plan?

1:12:03.444 --> 1:12:05.612
Find a parking spot,
sit tight till we show up.

1:12:05.904 --> 1:12:07.156
Simple as that.

1:12:07.614 --> 1:12:08.741
Nothing to worry about.

1:12:08.907 --> 1:12:10.451
-Watch it!
-Hey, aunty!

1:12:10.534 --> 1:12:11.618
Fuck off, you half-wit!

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:14.038
Can't see with this thing in my face!

1:12:14.246 --> 1:12:15.956
Whatever you do,
keep your face covered.

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:18.751
I'm assuming there's going to be
an explanation at some point?

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:20.794
Yes, of course, but later.

1:12:21.503 --> 1:12:23.088
-Did you get the money?
-Yeah.

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.549
Why do we have to give it back?
That guy's an asshole.

1:12:25.758 --> 1:12:26.925
This isn't a robbery.

1:12:27.092 --> 1:12:28.927
We're taking back what's ours,
returning what's his.

1:12:29.136 --> 1:12:30.763
-Ours?
-Nothing is ours.

1:12:30.846 --> 1:12:32.598
We're just the dumb fucks
stuck in the middle!

1:12:32.681 --> 1:12:33.974
We should keep the fucking money.

1:12:34.224 --> 1:12:35.100
Cow!

1:12:41.815 --> 1:12:44.818
You drive, let me do the thinking.

1:12:45.194 --> 1:12:49.698
"Show me the money, or get lost"

1:12:49.865 --> 1:12:54.620
"Show me the money, or get lost"

1:12:54.745 --> 1:12:59.583
"Show me the money, or get lost"

1:13:01.418 --> 1:13:04.296
Okay, find a spot as close to the store
as you can, park there.

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:06.507
Man, I'm dying in this.
Do you know how hot this thing is?

1:13:06.632 --> 1:13:08.592
Yes, I'm wearing one.

1:13:14.431 --> 1:13:17.226
Move, you fuck.
Are you blind?

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:25.609
No, not this either.

1:13:26.151 --> 1:13:27.528
Ma'am, how about this one?

1:13:28.362 --> 1:13:29.822
No, show me something else.

1:13:30.364 --> 1:13:33.450
Ma'am, if you tell me
what you're looking for

1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.035
then I'll be able to help you better.

1:13:35.327 --> 1:13:37.996
Not this, please show me something else.

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:39.164
Okay, ma'am.

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:41.542
How about this?

1:13:43.794 --> 1:13:44.753
Let's go!

1:13:45.671 --> 1:13:47.381
Let's go, everything's crappy.

1:13:48.757 --> 1:13:50.926
Hold on, hold on!

1:13:51.718 --> 1:13:53.095
What's the matter, ma'am?
You didn't like anything?

1:13:53.178 --> 1:13:54.471
No, this is garbage.

1:13:54.596 --> 1:13:59.810
Why don't you step into my office?
I have something you'll love.

1:14:00.352 --> 1:14:01.854
Please, come.

1:14:02.312 --> 1:14:05.190
Nafisa, will you wait here?
I'll be right back.

1:14:05.649 --> 1:14:06.859
Nafisa.

1:14:09.319 --> 1:14:10.446
I'll be back.

1:14:10.779 --> 1:14:12.531
Please, come.

1:14:13.907 --> 1:14:18.954
"Everything reminds me of you..."

1:14:19.204 --> 1:14:20.205
Hello.

1:14:20.372 --> 1:14:21.290
How are you, sir?

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:22.458
Very well.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:25.711
Is my set ready?
Or will you make me wait again?

1:14:37.473 --> 1:14:38.599
Uday.

1:14:48.775 --> 1:14:49.735
Madam, orange juice?

1:14:51.904 --> 1:14:52.863
Ladies first.

1:14:58.368 --> 1:14:59.203
Thank you.

1:15:12.341 --> 1:15:13.675
What range are you looking in?

1:15:13.926 --> 1:15:15.802
Price is out of the question.

1:15:16.428 --> 1:15:20.057
Only a connoisseur
can appreciate true craftsmanship.

1:15:34.154 --> 1:15:34.988
Just a minute.

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:39.826
Here you go. Just for you.

1:15:41.495 --> 1:15:45.332
You won't find such fine work
anywhere else, I guarantee it.

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:47.292
Does it come with anklets?

1:15:47.376 --> 1:15:49.086
Of course, let me show you.

1:15:49.419 --> 1:15:52.339
Where are those anklets?

1:15:52.548 --> 1:15:54.049
Shit! Fuck!

1:15:55.842 --> 1:15:56.843
Those anklets...

1:15:58.845 --> 1:16:00.013
Hands up.

1:16:20.033 --> 1:16:21.034
Get back!

1:16:21.618 --> 1:16:24.705
This isn't a robbery, I'm taking back
what's mine. Your money's outside.

1:16:24.788 --> 1:16:26.623
-Menaka.
-You won't get away.

1:16:26.707 --> 1:16:28.000
Don't worry about me, you thief.

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:29.126
Tape, tape.

1:16:31.628 --> 1:16:36.091
Damn, fuck! You fucker!
You fucking rat! Fuck, I should rob you!

1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:37.551
Menaka...

1:16:37.634 --> 1:16:39.678
-My shoe...
-Open your mouth!

1:16:41.430 --> 1:16:42.264
Oh fuck!

1:16:50.939 --> 1:16:55.652
"Your love is my life..."

1:16:56.194 --> 1:16:58.822
Sir, here's your set.

1:16:59.197 --> 1:17:03.869
"I can't forget your love,
Even I try to"

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:09.458
Wow! I never imagined it would
turn out so beautifully.

1:17:11.251 --> 1:17:15.172
I want to thank him personally.
Where is he?

1:17:15.505 --> 1:17:17.466
In his office, I'll call him.

1:17:23.722 --> 1:17:25.807
Walk, don't run.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:31.605
Hey!

1:17:31.688 --> 1:17:33.190
-Stop!
-Okay, run! Run!

1:17:33.273 --> 1:17:34.316
-Catch them.
-Run!

1:17:34.941 --> 1:17:36.151
Catch them!

1:17:38.820 --> 1:17:40.030
Stop them!

1:17:41.031 --> 1:17:42.324
Catch them!

1:17:42.449 --> 1:17:46.578
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:17:46.703 --> 1:17:50.749
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:17:50.874 --> 1:17:55.295
"Here it comes,
Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:17:55.462 --> 1:18:00.050
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!
Here it comes"

1:18:04.763 --> 1:18:05.597
Thank you.

1:18:08.558 --> 1:18:12.562
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:18:12.771 --> 1:18:16.942
"Run! Run! D.K. Bose, run!"

1:18:17.150 --> 1:18:18.568
"Here it comes..."

1:18:18.652 --> 1:18:21.196
Tashi! Tashi, here!

1:18:21.488 --> 1:18:24.700
Arup! Tashi, over here! Come on!

1:18:28.161 --> 1:18:29.496
"Run! Run!"

1:18:30.414 --> 1:18:31.456
"Run! Run!"

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:33.542
"Run! Run!"

1:18:35.085 --> 1:18:35.919
Hey!

1:18:43.510 --> 1:18:44.386
"Run! Run!"

1:18:45.595 --> 1:18:46.430
Crazy.

1:18:48.557 --> 1:18:49.683
You guys!

1:18:53.603 --> 1:18:54.521
Crazy!

1:19:25.135 --> 1:19:26.261
What the...

1:19:27.053 --> 1:19:28.764
Menaka!

1:19:30.098 --> 1:19:32.100
Shit! Menaka!

1:19:45.197 --> 1:19:46.531
So, what was all this all about?

1:19:47.491 --> 1:19:48.867
Save his wife.

1:19:49.618 --> 1:19:50.577
She's not my wife.

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.662
Wife-to-be, fiance, whatever.

1:19:56.082 --> 1:19:57.209
You're engaged?

1:20:06.468 --> 1:20:07.677
What was her name again?

1:20:09.387 --> 1:20:10.514
Leena.

1:20:11.306 --> 1:20:12.516
Leena.

1:20:13.767 --> 1:20:16.144
Once we're there,
just point her out to me.

1:20:16.645 --> 1:20:18.313
I'll take care of the rest.

1:20:20.690 --> 1:20:25.445
I think we should just let them go
with a warning, right?

1:20:26.029 --> 1:20:30.951
Is that what the whore-lover thinks?

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:35.413
I'll drag all those
Godless bastards to the station...

1:20:35.789 --> 1:20:38.250
and thrash them senseless!

1:20:38.375 --> 1:20:42.921
Control room, I'm following a red car,
request immediate backup!

1:20:43.046 --> 1:20:48.885
Red car, DL 3C 6390, near Dhaula Kuan,
all units in area, please assist.

1:20:48.969 --> 1:20:49.803
Sir?

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:51.888
Yeah, turn around.

1:20:52.138 --> 1:20:54.474
Friday, 1:48 p.m.

1:20:56.601 --> 1:21:02.566
Your boyfriend was supposed to be
here by two. He isn't here yet.

1:21:02.899 --> 1:21:05.610
Personally, I have nothing against you.

1:21:07.779 --> 1:21:11.283
But, I have no other choice.

1:21:13.618 --> 1:21:15.745
Who knows what your
story would have been...

1:21:16.997 --> 1:21:19.416
if you'd fallen in
love with someone else.

1:21:19.499 --> 1:21:23.336
Please, please,
please, I'm begging you.

1:21:23.420 --> 1:21:25.255
Just five minutes, he'll be here.

1:21:25.380 --> 1:21:26.214
Sorry, ma'am.

1:21:26.715 --> 1:21:27.883
Deadline is a deadline.

1:21:28.383 --> 1:21:29.342
10.

1:21:30.802 --> 1:21:31.636
9.

1:21:32.846 --> 1:21:33.930
8.

1:21:34.973 --> 1:21:36.349
7.

1:21:37.017 --> 1:21:38.059
6.

1:21:39.185 --> 1:21:40.020
5.

1:21:52.115 --> 1:21:55.785
What the...
Did you see that?

1:21:56.578 --> 1:21:59.247
Sir, can we try again?

1:21:59.915 --> 1:22:00.749
You think?

1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:05.170
We have ten minutes, we'll get bored.

1:22:09.090 --> 1:22:09.925
Pick her up.

1:22:14.346 --> 1:22:15.472
You guys wait here.

1:22:16.181 --> 1:22:17.515
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

1:22:17.766 --> 1:22:19.643
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

1:22:20.435 --> 1:22:21.519
You don't have to.

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:22.687
This is my problem.

1:22:23.188 --> 1:22:24.898
I'm coming with you.

1:22:25.982 --> 1:22:27.067
Man!

1:22:29.903 --> 1:22:30.904
Will you wait here?

1:22:31.279 --> 1:22:32.322
We'll be back soon.

1:22:34.157 --> 1:22:35.408
I'll think about it.

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:44.793
Where are you going?

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.294
Where do you think?

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:03.728
8.

1:23:03.812 --> 1:23:05.730
-Please, please. No, no, no.
-7.

1:23:06.398 --> 1:23:07.857
6.

1:23:08.191 --> 1:23:09.693
5.

1:23:10.068 --> 1:23:10.902
4.

1:23:11.111 --> 1:23:12.278
-Please, I beg you.
-3.

1:23:19.327 --> 1:23:20.870
Get it.

1:23:37.804 --> 1:23:39.097
Do not disturb.

1:23:39.431 --> 1:23:41.558
Hurry up, we don't have much time.

1:23:54.612 --> 1:23:55.655
Give it to me.

1:23:56.364 --> 1:23:57.824
Let her go first.

1:24:00.285 --> 1:24:02.746
That was an order, not a request.

1:24:05.457 --> 1:24:07.375
Man, don't fuck around.

1:24:11.629 --> 1:24:13.256
First, the four of us
will go down to the lobby.

1:24:14.424 --> 1:24:17.218
Meet me at the lobby and
I'll give it to you.

1:24:17.343 --> 1:24:18.970
What are you doing, man?

1:24:20.096 --> 1:24:21.389
Is that so?

1:24:23.224 --> 1:24:24.976
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

1:24:26.311 --> 1:24:27.896
I'll tell you what will happen.

1:24:28.605 --> 1:24:30.356
First, I'll kill her.

1:24:31.232 --> 1:24:32.233
-Tashi!
-Quiet.

1:24:32.317 --> 1:24:33.777
Tashi, please give him what he wants--

1:24:33.902 --> 1:24:34.778
Quiet.

1:24:34.861 --> 1:24:35.862
Shut up!

1:24:36.696 --> 1:24:37.614
-What happened?
-Sorry.

1:24:39.616 --> 1:24:40.784
And then the three of you.

1:24:41.451 --> 1:24:43.703
Either way, I'll get what I want.

1:24:44.245 --> 1:24:49.000
You really think your bravery is
going to change the world?

1:24:50.627 --> 1:24:52.670
You son of a...

1:24:56.508 --> 1:24:59.636
Man, oh man!

1:24:59.886 --> 1:25:01.054
Shit, shit.

1:25:01.596 --> 1:25:02.430
Shit!

1:25:02.889 --> 1:25:04.474
Sisterfucker.

1:25:05.809 --> 1:25:07.310
You're pulling a gun on me?

1:25:07.644 --> 1:25:10.146
You fucker, do you know how long
I've been in this business?

1:25:12.857 --> 1:25:14.192
What do you think?

1:25:14.734 --> 1:25:19.030
Putting a gun to my head gives you
permission to fuck me in the ass?

1:25:19.239 --> 1:25:20.156
Sisterfucker!

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.575
Police! Nobody moves!

1:25:49.811 --> 1:25:51.354
Happy anniversary, darling.

1:25:51.479 --> 1:25:52.438
Cheers.

1:26:25.221 --> 1:26:26.514
Next time...

1:26:26.598 --> 1:26:28.474
can we please just go to

1:26:28.558 --> 1:26:30.476
fucking Disneyland?

1:27:49.180 --> 1:27:51.683
No!

1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:31.764
So, they are right.

1:28:33.599 --> 1:28:34.684
You are a lesbian.

1:28:35.685 --> 1:28:36.894
I should've known.

1:28:37.478 --> 1:28:38.771
What're you talking about, man?

1:28:38.855 --> 1:28:39.981
I saw you, okay?

1:28:40.398 --> 1:28:42.191
I saw you kissing that woman in the burqa.

1:28:42.275 --> 1:28:44.277
What're you doing?
Following me around?

1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:45.737
So you won't deny it?

1:28:46.237 --> 1:28:47.238
Rajeev, enough!

1:28:47.322 --> 1:28:48.573
So you're not going to
deny it?

1:28:48.865 --> 1:28:49.866
Stop, damn it!

1:28:50.283 --> 1:28:53.161
Okay, who the hell were you kissing?
Who were you kissing?

1:28:53.536 --> 1:28:54.662
Me.

1:28:57.832 --> 1:28:58.958
She was kissing me.

1:28:59.917 --> 1:29:00.877
You don't approve?

1:29:15.308 --> 1:29:16.976
She was kissing you?

1:29:39.499 --> 1:29:40.416
Fuck!

1:30:03.314 --> 1:30:05.983
Smuggling ring busted.
by Tashi Dorjee Lhatoo.

1:30:09.487 --> 1:30:11.072
It's well written.

1:30:11.322 --> 1:30:12.865
Did you say it's brilliantly written?

1:30:13.032 --> 1:30:16.285
I said, are you sure they can't
trace that fucking car back to us?

1:30:16.953 --> 1:30:18.246
It's in my father-in-law's name.

1:30:18.329 --> 1:30:19.956
He reported it stolen,
that should cover our asses.

1:30:20.039 --> 1:30:21.499
He's not your father-in-law.

1:30:21.624 --> 1:30:22.583
Yeah, yeah.

1:30:22.708 --> 1:30:24.585
So, Soniya called off the wedding?

1:30:24.710 --> 1:30:25.545
No.

1:30:26.546 --> 1:30:27.672
I did.

1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:29.215
You called it off?

1:30:31.217 --> 1:30:32.426
You called it off?

1:30:33.678 --> 1:30:35.138
He called it off?

1:30:38.266 --> 1:30:40.685
So you don't mind if I ask
Soniya out to dinner, right?

1:30:40.852 --> 1:30:41.686
Dude, what the...

1:30:41.853 --> 1:30:43.354
What, she's hot man.

1:30:44.438 --> 1:30:46.482
-You got more?
-Cupboard.

1:30:48.943 --> 1:30:50.027
So, you called up that guy?

1:30:50.111 --> 1:30:51.279
The art director, what's his name?

1:30:51.362 --> 1:30:52.321
I'm done with that crap.

1:30:52.405 --> 1:30:53.656
I'm moving back home.

1:30:54.115 --> 1:30:54.991
Why?

1:30:55.074 --> 1:30:57.285
I can't make the
fucking rent, that's why.

1:30:57.368 --> 1:30:59.579
Hey, what the hell?
What the hell is this?

1:31:18.472 --> 1:31:19.640
Don't look at me.

1:31:20.057 --> 1:31:21.809
It's the hand of God.

1:31:23.436 --> 1:31:25.104
You crazy bastard.

1:31:26.022 --> 1:31:28.441
-What?
-How can you do this?

1:31:29.150 --> 1:31:32.361
What? You don't want it,
I'll keep it all.

1:31:37.450 --> 1:31:44.498
"Your sight just pierced my heart"

1:31:44.790 --> 1:31:51.881
"Your sight just pierced my heart"

1:31:52.173 --> 1:31:58.930
"It's pierced! It's pierced!
It's pierced! It's pierced!"

1:31:59.055 --> 1:32:00.097
"Your sight..."

1:32:00.181 --> 1:32:06.437
This is all I have. Forget this ever
happened. Take care, have a good life.

1:32:14.070 --> 1:32:15.238
What are you doing now?

1:32:15.988 --> 1:32:17.406
Coming!

1:32:33.923 --> 1:32:35.925
Hey, stop playing with that.

1:32:37.385 --> 1:32:40.596
Vishal, did you show daddy
the card you made for uncle?

1:32:40.721 --> 1:32:41.847
Show it to him.

1:32:42.181 --> 1:32:43.349
You made a card for uncle?

1:32:43.516 --> 1:32:44.767
Very good.

1:32:45.142 --> 1:32:46.394
This is lovely

1:32:46.727 --> 1:32:48.145
Read it to me.

1:32:49.146 --> 1:32:52.275
Dear Uncle, we are all very sorry

1:32:52.358 --> 1:32:53.859
that bullet hit your bum.

1:32:54.068 --> 1:32:55.778
We hope, you can soon

1:32:55.945 --> 1:32:57.613
go potty on your own.

1:32:58.906 --> 1:33:00.491
Is that what you've written?

1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:02.201
He can't write that.

1:33:02.326 --> 1:33:03.452
You're right.

1:33:05.246 --> 1:33:07.540
Actually son, it should be...

1:33:07.707 --> 1:33:09.583
A bullet hit your bum.

1:33:10.042 --> 1:33:11.502
We all are very sorry

1:33:11.711 --> 1:33:13.212
a bullet hit your bum.

1:33:15.506 --> 1:33:17.633
What are you doing?
You'll break it!

1:33:17.883 --> 1:33:18.801
Write down...

1:33:18.968 --> 1:33:20.845
Write 'a'.

1:33:21.637 --> 1:33:23.139
Come on, let's go.

1:33:35.067 --> 1:33:36.610
-Ready?
-Yes, let's go.

1:34:17.610 --> 1:34:19.070
I don't have that car anymore.

1:34:24.533 --> 1:34:26.285
The magic photo, this...

1:34:29.747 --> 1:34:30.581
It's yours.

1:34:30.998 --> 1:34:32.083
No.

1:34:32.666 --> 1:34:34.001
Bye, Tashi.

1:34:41.008 --> 1:34:43.344
...listen to VJ Sohaya's new song.

1:34:43.469 --> 1:34:45.221
'I hate you, like I love you.'

1:34:45.388 --> 1:34:47.431
Like I love you, in brackets.

1:34:47.515 --> 1:34:50.810
"I hate you, like I love you"

1:34:51.102 --> 1:34:52.561

Love you, love you!"

1:35:02.279 --> 1:35:05.908
"Your love has made me crazy"

1:35:06.033 --> 1:35:09.620
"Your love has made me crazy"

1:35:09.745 --> 1:35:13.457
"This pain has made me crazy"

1:35:15.209 --> 1:35:16.043
Bastard!

1:35:16.127 --> 1:35:17.461
You're going to pay for that!

1:35:18.546 --> 1:35:21.882
"I hate you, like I love you"

1:35:22.216 --> 1:35:25.886

1:35:44.613 --> 1:35:48.409
"Your love has made me crazy"

1:35:49.326 --> 1:35:54.290
"Only fortunate ones
Find a heartless like you"

1:35:54.373 --> 1:35:56.333
"Only fortunate ones do"

1:35:56.459 --> 1:35:59.753
"You are you so cold-hearted"

1:35:59.879 --> 1:36:01.714
"You can pierce just right through"

1:36:01.839 --> 1:36:03.507
"You can pierce just right through"

1:36:03.591 --> 1:36:05.342
"But you are in my blood"

1:36:05.468 --> 1:36:07.052
"I just can't quit"

1:36:07.178 --> 1:36:10.639
"Infection! Addiction!
You give me such a kick"

1:36:10.764 --> 1:36:14.226
"I hate you, like I love you"

1:36:14.477 --> 1:36:18.147
"I hate you, like I love you,
Love you, love you!"

1:36:18.230 --> 1:36:21.734

Love you, love you!"

1:36:33.204 --> 1:36:36.832
"This pain has made me crazy"

1:36:36.999 --> 1:36:40.461
"Your love has made me crazy"

1:36:40.544 --> 1:36:42.087
"Shake that biscuit, baby"

1:36:42.421 --> 1:36:43.714
"Shake it for me"

1:36:43.797 --> 1:36:44.632
Disco.

1:36:50.304 --> 1:36:51.764

1:36:59.647 --> 1:37:02.900
"Look into my eyes"

1:37:03.025 --> 1:37:05.110
"Intoxicate me"

1:37:05.194 --> 1:37:07.029

1:37:07.238 --> 1:37:10.324
"The feeling of death"

1:37:10.866 --> 1:37:12.535
"Is unlike any other"

1:37:12.618 --> 1:37:14.161
"Is unlike any other"

1:37:14.245 --> 1:37:15.996
"But you are in my blood"

1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:17.748
"I just can't quit"

1:37:17.873 --> 1:37:21.544
"Infection! Addiction!
You give me such a kick"

1:37:21.627 --> 1:37:24.838

1:37:52.116 --> 1:37:53.909
Disco Fighter.

1:37:57.454 --> 1:38:02.626
A four that soars across
the boundary, is called a sixer.
