WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:03.046
- Previously on "The Flash"...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.265
- My cure will work.

00:04.308 --> 00:05.918
- Or turn them
into meta-humans.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.443
Beginning biopsy examination

00:08.486 --> 00:10.662
on Patient 1-A,
Mitch Romero.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.535
- I want to become a defense
attorney for meta-humans.

00:13.578 --> 00:14.884
- Babe,
do you know how many people

00:14.927 --> 00:16.103
you could help in this city?

00:16.146 --> 00:17.626
- Hi, I'm here about
the internship.

00:17.669 --> 00:18.931
- Welcome to "The Citizen."

00:18.975 --> 00:21.195
- In order
for billions to survive,

00:21.238 --> 00:23.284
the Flash must die.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.112
- I'm gonna go see
this Crisis for myself.

00:27.244 --> 00:30.813
The only timeline where
you all survived was if I died.

00:30.856 --> 00:31.988
- So what do we tell them?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.381
- Whatever we're gonna do,

00:33.424 --> 00:35.426
we can't tell the team
I'm gonna die.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.303
- Add all these
to the inventory, boys.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.218
Tomorrow's bake sale
is gonna be a real treat.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.829
- Who died and made you boss?

00:46.872 --> 00:48.178
- Mitch Romero.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.093
- Still no word from him?

00:50.137 --> 00:52.704
That makes Romero missing,
not dead.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.664
- In our line of work,
what's the difference?

00:55.707 --> 00:57.100
This is my crew now.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.637
Fan out.
Whoever's here, put him down.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.649
- Romero?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.829
- The Monitor?

02:13.872 --> 02:15.004
Where did you see him?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.310
- We went in the Time Vault,

02:16.353 --> 02:18.268
right after putting Chester
in the MAC.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.402
The Crisis that he spoke about
last year,

02:21.445 --> 02:23.404
it's the same one
in the plinth's newspaper.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.972
And it's not coming in 2024.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.758
It's coming December 10th...

02:29.801 --> 02:31.325
2019.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.762
- Are you sure about this?
- The jackass lied to you.

02:33.805 --> 02:37.157
- Yeah, well,
we thought so, too, but...

02:37.200 --> 02:39.507
Barry went to Earth-3,

02:39.550 --> 02:43.293
and Jay Garrick helped him see
that it was true.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.294
- How did he do that?

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
- Jay projected my mind

02:46.340 --> 02:48.298
forward into the future.

02:48.342 --> 02:52.346
- Okay.
And what did you see?

02:52.389 --> 02:55.175
- I saw a giant wave
of anti-matter

02:55.218 --> 02:56.263
sweeping over our Earth.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.221
Vaporized all of Central City

02:58.265 --> 03:00.267
and everybody in it.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.920
Including you three.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.792
- Great.
I'll go mark my calendar.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.228
- We still have seven weeks

03:05.272 --> 03:06.360
to make sure
none of this happens.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.448
- Guys, Barry's right.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.797
We've changed
the future before.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.407
We can change it again.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.888
- So what else did
our Asgardian cosplayer say?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.196
- That was pretty much it.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.329
- It's Joe.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.375
Needs me at CCPD,
but that can wait.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.377
We--we need to get on this.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.248
- Yeah, we should spend
every minute we have on this.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.207
- No, guys, look,
what we should do

03:27.250 --> 03:29.557
is take a well-deserved
time-out

03:29.600 --> 03:31.472
and come back tomorrow
with clear heads.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.430
- Okay.
If you think so.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.087
- What now?

03:43.919 --> 03:46.878
- I have to prepare them
for what's coming.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.707
They have to be ready to go on
without me.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.407
I guess I know
who I need to start with.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.415
- Mom?

04:01.458 --> 04:02.503
- Ralphy!

04:02.546 --> 04:06.637
Ralph, oh, come here, baby.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.639
Those stupid things.
- What happened?

04:08.683 --> 04:10.293
- Last night,
10:00 p.m.,

04:10.337 --> 04:13.427
the Avenue M pawn shop
was robbed at gunpoint.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.733
The shop owner ID'd your mom
as the perp,

04:15.777 --> 04:17.692
so we had to hold her.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.476
Charges pending.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.350
Mrs. Dibny,
this is Cecile Horton.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.308
Ralph, good luck.

04:27.005 --> 04:31.401
- Look, Cecile, yes, my mom
has an eventful past, but...

04:31.445 --> 04:35.187
- Okay, robbery,
larceny, bribery--

04:35.231 --> 04:36.928
- 14 allegations.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.453
Not a single charge,
Miss Perfect Hemline.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.585
- Thank you.
Um...

04:41.629 --> 04:43.892
Ooh, it says here that
the owner of the pawn shop

04:43.935 --> 04:46.373
personally identified you
as the robber.

04:46.416 --> 04:50.202
- Okay, I was in the shop,
but not at 10:00.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.553
I left around 5:00.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.120
- Okay, so the robbery
was, like, five hours later,

04:55.164 --> 04:56.905
so, Mom,
where were you around 10:00?

04:56.948 --> 04:59.429
- Yeah.
- Is it really that important?

04:59.473 --> 05:02.127
- Wait, yesterday
was the second Monday

05:02.171 --> 05:03.607
of the month, so, Mom...

05:05.043 --> 05:06.828
- Yeah.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.048
I was at the Cleaner's Royale
on Oak.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.572
- Okay, dry cleaners.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.878
- It's a little bit
of a gambling front.

05:13.922 --> 05:17.969
- Wow, Mom, the last time
that I was there was when...

05:18.013 --> 05:20.450
when you and Marv Perez
were an item.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.453
May he rest in peace.
- Oh.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.976
- Well, Ralphy,
I really don't think

05:25.020 --> 05:27.370
anyone there
is gonna help with my alibi.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.633
- There's only one way
to find out.

05:29.677 --> 05:30.852
- Road trip.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.596
- Joe thinks
there's a meta-killer

05:35.639 --> 05:37.380
that might be involved,
so if anybody asks,

05:37.424 --> 05:39.469
you're my meta-human
consultant.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.428
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.386
- The security guard
from a nearby building

05:43.430 --> 05:44.648
heard the gunshots.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.390
Said it sounded
like a war zone.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.305
We haven't found
enough body parts

05:49.349 --> 05:51.699
to determine
which crew did all this.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.353
- He's covered in claw marks.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.616
An animal did this.
Good to go?

05:55.659 --> 05:58.183
- No, we're not.
This--this isn't animal blood.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.577
- There's two more bodies,
or what's left of them,

06:00.621 --> 06:03.363
and a lot more
of whatever that is.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.495
- I see one arm, two arms.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.497
Hm.
They're from the same person.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.890
- I'll analyze this.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.761
Hopefully, it'll lead us
to our killer.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.676
- Thank you.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.461
Can you analyze
what's going on with her?

06:14.504 --> 06:16.419
- Yeah, I'm trying.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
Frost!
Frost, what are you doing?

06:17.681 --> 06:19.944
- There's no ammo in these.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.032
- I know these guns.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.471
They're charged
with dark matter.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.647
They're all empty.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.083
Who would kill for dark matter?

06:28.126 --> 06:30.390
- A coward.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.970
- Gotcha.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.503
- What did you do?

06:56.546 --> 06:57.765
- Frost, what are you doing?

06:57.808 --> 06:59.549
You're supposed to be
following my lead, not--

06:59.593 --> 07:01.246
- Getting a damn murderer
to confess?

07:01.290 --> 07:03.205
- There's no evidence
he's involved.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.685
Ease up.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.643
Let him go.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.478
Cait?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.740
You're Killer Frost?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.873
- Actually, she's me,
Sad Coffee Guy.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.484
- I am so sorry.
My name is Barry Allen.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.094
I'm a forensic scientist
with CCPD.

07:23.138 --> 07:27.055
We're investigating a series
of meta-related murders,

07:27.098 --> 07:30.275
and Caitlin and Frost
are my meta-human consultants.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.495
- Dr. Ramsey Rosso.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.801
- What happened to your lab?

07:35.150 --> 07:39.110
- Um, somebody broke in
while I was working late.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.463
- This same substance
was at our crime scene.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.030
I think the meta
that attacked you

07:46.074 --> 07:47.379
is the person
we're looking for.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.511
- The guy we're looking for

07:48.555 --> 07:50.731
stole dark matter
from a stash house.

07:50.774 --> 07:54.952
-  I did have a small
amount of dark matter here.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.476
- Where'd you get it from?
- From an old colleague.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.955
Ted Kord.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.305
He was actually willing
to help me with my research.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.569
- Well, someone's out there
hunting for dark matter,

08:02.612 --> 08:03.961
and he's willing to kill
to get it,

08:04.005 --> 08:06.311
so whatever it is
you're working on--

08:06.355 --> 08:09.619
- Look, Mr. Allen, my HLH
research is very important.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.534
I lost my mother
to this disease.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.232
Now, you mentioned you found
a similar substance,

08:14.276 --> 08:15.799
both here
and at your crime scene.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.541
- And, honestly, it's unlike
anything I've seen before.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.326
- Well,
I am a blood specialist.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.198
Perhaps I could be
of some assistance.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.547
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.376
You are not actually gonna
trust this guy, are you?

08:27.419 --> 08:29.465
'Cause I don't.
- I'm sorry.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.511
Frost...

08:32.686 --> 08:34.992
People are dying out there,
all right?

08:35.036 --> 08:37.342
If Dr. Rosso can help us
in any way,

08:37.386 --> 08:40.520
then, yeah, I'm open to it,
and you should be, too.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.697
Would you help us, Dr. Rosso?

08:45.263 --> 08:48.136
- Please, call me Ramsey.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.792
- Morning, boss.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.707
I have got the mother
of all scoops,

08:53.750 --> 08:54.795
and thanks to your new intern,

08:54.838 --> 08:56.753
it's gonna be
a CCC Media exclusive.

08:56.797 --> 08:59.756
- Actually, you know,
I was hoping

08:59.800 --> 09:02.542
that you would help me
with the new filing system.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.239
- Alphabetical is great.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.068
So there was a break-in
at McCulloch Tech last night.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.548
Nothing was stolen,

09:08.591 --> 09:10.419
but you'll never guess
who the perp is.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.074
Get this.
Harrison Wells is alive.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.469
- Where'd you get this?

09:17.513 --> 09:20.603
- One of the McCulloch security
guards and I go way back.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.518
- Nice work.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.911
Um, I'll tell you what.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.000
I will look into this,
and in the meantime,

09:26.043 --> 09:27.871
I could use some quotes
on that mayor story.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.438
The city council's
wondering how long

09:29.481 --> 09:30.787
this new one's gonna last.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.790
- Uh...I'd rather do this.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.749
- Allegra, look,
I understand, okay?

09:35.792 --> 09:38.621
I was an ambitious cub reporter
once, too.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.970
You know, this is great work,

09:40.014 --> 09:42.538
but I will take it
from here, okay?

09:42.582 --> 09:43.844
- Fine.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.808
- Ralphy boy!

09:51.852 --> 09:54.463
Long time no see.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.943
Looking trim.
- Thanks, Tony.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.684
- Deb.
- Howdy, Tone-Loc.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.468
- I need a favor, Tony.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.513
- Yeah, hi,
the Avenue M pawn shop

10:01.557 --> 10:02.819
was robbed last night,

10:02.863 --> 10:05.866
and the police think
that Debbie was responsible.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.868
- We just need the footage
from your security camera

10:07.911 --> 10:09.217
so we can prove that Mom
was here last night.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.219
- Last night?
Yeah, Deb was here.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.568
- Great.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.004
- But I don't work
with the cops.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.527
House policy.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.834
Besides, you know I don't have
cameras in here, Deb.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.838
- Potted plant.
- Ugly lamp on the bar.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.189
- Smoke detectors
one, two, three.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.670
- I like you, Ralphy.
Guess what?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.890
You can have the footage.
- Oh, great.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.762
- For 5,000 bucks.
- I'm sorry, what?

10:35.939 --> 10:38.768
- Come back and see me
when you got the green.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.465
Good to see you, Ralphy boy.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.251
That was a bust.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.732
Oh, well.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.865
- Wait, wait, wait,
hang on, hang on, hang on, Mom.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.694
We might not got the green.
We can earn it.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.914
- Right.
- Uh, excuse me, down here.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.567
How exactly
are we going to earn it?

10:55.611 --> 10:56.917
- Watch me, sweetie.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.834
- So can I talk to Cait?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.052
Can she hear me right now?

11:02.096 --> 11:05.795
- One, it's Frost.
I'm rebranding.

11:05.839 --> 11:09.016
And two, sure.
She can if she wants to.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.409
- Caitlin,
I want to explain myself.

11:11.453 --> 11:14.761
About purchasing dark matter
from Kord Industries.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.501
I hope you understand
if there's any chance

11:16.545 --> 11:17.851
of saving more lives--

11:17.894 --> 11:19.766
- You're gonna take it.
Right.

11:19.809 --> 11:20.854
- I didn't want to go
behind your back,

11:20.897 --> 11:21.855
but you refused to help me.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.291
- Not listening anymore.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.727
- And you never told me
that you were a meta.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.729
I thought we were
closer than that, Cait.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.732
- Huh. Guess you two aren't as
good of friends as you thought.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.694
- Hey, guys, CCPD got back
a DNA match on our meta.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.738
Mitch Romero.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.871
Do you recognize the name?
- No.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.220
- Mitch Romero is the head

11:39.263 --> 11:42.223
of Central City's biggest
gun-running operation.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.573
What?
I have friends in low places.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.967
Romero must've been looking
for dark matter last night

11:47.010 --> 11:48.185
when he went to the only
place he knew he'd find it.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.621
His own stash.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.972
- Why rob yourself and then
kill all your employees?

11:54.191 --> 11:56.716
Someone just broke
into Mercury Labs.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.847
- A facility like that
would have

11:57.891 --> 12:00.023
undisclosed amounts
of dark matter.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.979
- What did you do?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.768
- What did you do?
Frost!

12:48.811 --> 12:49.899
You just killed him!

12:49.943 --> 12:50.857
We're supposed to cuff metas,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.467
not throw them out windows.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.121
- Calm down.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.819
Romero is fine.
He just got up and walked away.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.038
- You had no idea
that would happen

12:58.081 --> 12:59.822
when you shot him
out the window.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.302
You let your anger
get the better of you.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.956
I thought you had
a handle on that.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.827
Frost!
That cannot happen again.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.090
- What, now you're telling me
how to feel?

13:07.134 --> 13:08.875
- Look, I have seven weeks
to teach you

13:08.918 --> 13:10.964
how to handle
this kind of situation.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.226
You have to start listening.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.358
- You have to stop being
such a crappy teacher.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.668
- ♪ Money,
that's what I want ♪

13:19.711 --> 13:20.669
- Make sure she loses.

13:20.712 --> 13:21.975
- Tony's security footage

13:22.018 --> 13:22.976
is on a USB drive
in his office.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.760
Buy me as much time as you can.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.414
- Okay, it's fine.
We got it. Go.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.198
Okay.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.248
He's nervous.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.510
Go. Do it.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.993
- Pair of tens.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.039
- Can't bluff a bluffer.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.041
- ♪ Money,
that's what I want ♪

13:45.085 --> 13:47.914
♪ Hate to tell you, baby

13:50.307 --> 13:52.440
- Boom.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.008
- You're kidding me.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.575
- Debbie's hot tonight.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.977
- Uh, Debbie.
Oh, Deb.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.240
- ♪ Money,
that's what I want ♪

14:10.284 --> 14:13.287
- All in.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.035
- Read 'em and weep.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.213
- Ooh, tough break, Deb.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.042
- I'm sorry, Mom.
We tried.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.696
Let's get you home.
Good to see you, Tony.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.437
Keep up the not-so-legal work.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.920
- ♪ Money,
that's what I want ♪

14:39.791 --> 14:41.532
- Hey.
- Where's Killer Caitlin?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.491
Out assaulting another suspect
without cause?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
- She's taking a breather.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.103
Did you find anything
helpful from the sample?

14:47.147 --> 14:48.931
- More than I ever imagined.
- Yeah?

14:48.975 --> 14:51.716
- Take a look at the pattern
of these gene transcriptions.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.196
Romero's
dark matter-infused cells

14:53.240 --> 14:55.155
are destroying
his normal cells.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.939
He's more monster now than man.

14:56.983 --> 14:57.940
The more dark matter
he absorbs,

14:57.984 --> 14:58.941
the stronger he gets.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.377
- According to this,

15:00.421 --> 15:03.424
Romero's been dead
for over 24 hours.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.818
That's why he can't die.

15:06.862 --> 15:07.950
He already has.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.562
Um, thank you for your help,
Dr. Rosso.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.000
- Barry.
- Yeah?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.045
- If I could observe
Romero's genes

15:16.089 --> 15:17.960
interacting with dark matter,

15:18.004 --> 15:20.180
I might be able to find a way
to counteract his condition.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.008
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.705
Working with dark matter
can be really dangerous.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.186
- Mr. Allen, I'm the top
hematologic oncologist

15:26.229 --> 15:27.665
in the western hemisphere.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.058
There's a creature out there

15:29.102 --> 15:30.059
with a metastasized
blood chemistry

15:30.103 --> 15:31.582
with the strength of ten men,

15:31.626 --> 15:32.975
and he's getting stronger
by the minute.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.413
Please, let me help.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.418
- The satellite's facial
recognition spotted

15:41.462 --> 15:43.594
our news Wells
less than an hour ago.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.858
According to Miranda,
it's somewhere in this area.

16:02.178 --> 16:05.225
- Harrison Wells,
welcome to Earth-1.

16:05.268 --> 16:06.487
My name is Cisco Ramon.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.273
- Why are you following me?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.319
- Oh, great.
Another angry one.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.755
- To get your hands
on this priceless beauty?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.104
Is that why?
Go ahead.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.192
It gives nightmare
hallucinations

16:16.236 --> 16:17.237
to all of its victims.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.108
Would you like that?

16:19.152 --> 16:20.762
Would you like that?
- No!

16:29.945 --> 16:31.686
- So...

16:31.729 --> 16:33.688
It's you.
- What?

16:34.384 --> 16:37.387
- What's your name?
- Iris West-Allen.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.867
- Well, Iris--

16:41.870 --> 16:43.654
- And don't you forget it.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.352
- I had that.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.096
- And there you are.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.140
- Wait. Oh, no, no, no.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.968
Debbie, um...

16:53.012 --> 16:54.274
that has you leaving at 9:30.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.058
We need to know
where you were at 10:00,

16:56.102 --> 16:57.581
the exact time of the robbery.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.367
- Went out for air.
Oh, well. We tried.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.282
- Hang on, there's another
camera angle outside.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.458
- Ralphy, don't...

17:04.501 --> 17:06.155
- Did you find her?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.637
- I did.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.247
With Marv Perez.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.207
Marv's alive?

17:15.599 --> 17:17.166
- Yeah.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.256
- You said he died
in a car accident months ago.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.084
You were with...

17:22.128 --> 17:23.607
Marv when the pawn shop
was robbed.

17:23.651 --> 17:26.349
- Ralphy, let me explain.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.004
- If Marv is alive, what about
your other boyfriends?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.267
How many of them are alive?

17:33.095 --> 17:35.402
Okay.
All of them.

17:35.445 --> 17:39.058
- Ralph, hey, you know what?
It's okay.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.320
This is--
this is a good thing

17:40.363 --> 17:43.236
because Marv is Debbie's alibi,

17:43.279 --> 17:45.673
so your mom
isn't gonna go to jail.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.414
- Yeah, let's focus on that.

17:47.457 --> 17:51.766
- Marv, Doug, Craig, Nick?
These guys, they...

17:51.809 --> 17:54.290
They were like family to me.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.596
How could you lie about that?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.467
- I don't know why
you're so upset, sweetie.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.730
You always moved on so quickly.

17:59.774 --> 18:03.343
- I was being strong for you.

18:03.386 --> 18:06.650
That doesn't mean it didn't
hurt like hell every damn time.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.131
What really happened?
- What always happens.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.611
You know, we were happy,

18:10.654 --> 18:14.136
but I knew it wouldn't last,
so I ended it.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.313
- What else did you lie about?

18:17.357 --> 18:19.837
Did Dad really leave us?
- Yes.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.100
That one is true.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.713
Ralphy,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.586
- My name is Ralph.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.806
You need to leave.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.242
Get out.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.332
Now.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.168
- I can't believe you and Cait
get to work here.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.216
- How will all this help?

18:53.349 --> 18:55.308
- Dark matter
is a miraculous thing.

18:55.351 --> 18:59.225
With gene splicing, I can use
your dark matter samples

18:59.268 --> 19:01.009
to negatively charge
Romero's blood.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.664
That should weaken him enough
for you to make an arrest.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.189
But, um...

19:07.233 --> 19:09.104
I, uh...

19:09.148 --> 19:11.889
I will need
a second centrifuge.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.197
- Oh. Uh, there's
another one downstairs.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.459
I'll get it.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.342
I had a feeling about you.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.608
I hoped I was wrong.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.654
But I know a desperate man
when I see one.

19:39.439 --> 19:40.831
Put them back.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.792
- No.
- I can make you.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.228
- Go on, then.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.448
Like you said,
I'm a desperate man.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.276
I have nothing to lose.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.365
- I thought you wanted
to save lives.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.236
- HLH isn't just
my mother's disease.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.373
First it killed her,
and now it's killing me.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.595
- I still can't let you
take those.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.815
Look at what it did
to Mitch Romero.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.906
- I am marking a calendar
every day until I die,

20:11.949 --> 20:13.560
waiting to fall off a cliff,

20:13.603 --> 20:16.650
powerless to grab
onto anything or anyone.

20:19.435 --> 20:25.049
I watched my mother
dive off that same cliff...

20:25.093 --> 20:27.226
with a smile on her face.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.881
She didn't even fight.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.928
- I know what it's like
to lose your mother.

20:35.799 --> 20:36.974
- I know you're angry.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.368
- This isn't anger.

20:39.412 --> 20:43.329
This is the pain
beneath my anger.

20:44.678 --> 20:48.464
It takes courage
to fight death.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.467
- Maybe it takes more
to accept it.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.384
- My mum had that same look
on her face

20:55.428 --> 20:57.517
when she was first diagnosed.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.869
You're a dead man, too.
Aren't you, Barry?

21:01.912 --> 21:04.393
So why don't you fight
for yourself?

21:05.742 --> 21:09.616
- I'm marking my calendar with
the days I have left to live.

21:09.659 --> 21:13.184
And I'm gonna spend them
saving as many people as I can.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.709
- You're not a coward.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.406
You're just naive.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.848
- Mitch Romero's
still out there.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.289
You said you wanted
to save lives.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.378
Prove it.
Help me stop him.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.336
Or get out of my lab.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.624
- Let's get to work.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.848
You know,
I don't understand you, Barry.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.241
You march towards death
without fear,

22:10.285 --> 22:12.374
just like Mum.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.246
Where is it
you get your strength?

22:15.290 --> 22:18.728
- Probably the same place
she did.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.034
People I love.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.992
- I see.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.083
Well, it must've been
incredibly hard to tell them.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.487
- You're a dead man, too.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.402
Aren't you, Barry?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.971
Well, it must've been
incredibly hard to tell them.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.802
This isn't anger.

22:48.845 --> 22:52.109
This is the pain
beneath my anger.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.041
- According to
his techno fanny pack,

23:11.085 --> 23:16.438
this belongs
to Dr. Harrison Nash Wells.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.663
- Easy.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.534
We're not gonna hurt you.
- No.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.406
Let's just try this again.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.842
All right, I'm Iris West-Allen.

23:28.885 --> 23:31.061
This is Cisco Ramon.
- Iris. Cisco.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.673
- And we are friends
of the Council of Wells.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.718
- Oh.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.852
Those idiots.
Okay, now.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.594
- Okay, listen,
I tased you once before,

23:41.637 --> 23:43.596
and I'm happy to do it again,
so just...

23:43.639 --> 23:44.684
- I let you do that.
Now hold still.

23:44.727 --> 23:45.902
- Ah, ah, ah.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.687
What are you doing
on our Earth?

23:47.730 --> 23:49.036
- What am I doing?
I'm searching for an artifact

23:49.079 --> 23:53.388
that just happens to contain
the same particles...

23:55.303 --> 23:58.872
I'm currently reading off you.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.090
- What?

24:00.134 --> 24:02.615
- Although...

24:02.658 --> 24:04.791
- What--what part--
particles of what?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.619
- Eternium.

24:06.662 --> 24:07.924
- Eternium?

24:07.968 --> 24:10.579
- Eternium is a Multiversal
element, all right?

24:10.623 --> 24:14.409
Although the readings
were stronger in the alley.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.932
- Listen, Indiana,

24:15.976 --> 24:17.891
I don't know how they do things
on your Earth,

24:17.934 --> 24:19.893
but this ain't
"Temple of Doom."

24:19.936 --> 24:23.026
And what is Eternium
supposed to be, anyway?

24:23.070 --> 24:27.944
Some kind of stolen mystical
element from the tiki gods

24:27.988 --> 24:30.469
that you suddenly
have to return?

24:30.512 --> 24:31.687
- Look, there's no such thing

24:31.731 --> 24:35.561
as mystical mumbo jumbo
or gods.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.085
What there are
are meta-humans, aliens,

24:38.128 --> 24:41.175
and false gods worshiped
by simple-minded people

24:41.218 --> 24:43.133
that find comfort in myths.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.570
I dispel those myths.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.529
You people are no help.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.662
- Newsflash, Nash.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.272
We've actually done
this dance before.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.447
- Is that right?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.101
- That's right.
- Yeah.

24:54.144 --> 24:57.321
- It usually starts off rocky,
especially between you and me,

24:57.365 --> 24:58.932
but eventually,
we bond,

24:58.975 --> 25:00.934
and you learn to embrace
that sensitive side.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.544
So why don't you just
drop the act,

25:02.588 --> 25:04.590
and show me that warm,

25:04.633 --> 25:09.551
compassionate, smart guy
that I know you to be.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.553
- Let me ask you a question.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
Do I look like
I want to hold hands?

25:14.904 --> 25:17.037
Interesting.

25:17.646 --> 25:21.650
- If you want your toys back,
you might just have to.

25:36.926 --> 25:41.583
Well, I have to admit.
That was pretty cool.

25:41.627 --> 25:42.628
- Yeah.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.720
- Does she know
about the Multiverse?

25:47.763 --> 25:50.287
- She kind of does now.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.724
I'll handle it.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.813
- I got the quotes
for the mayor story,

25:53.856 --> 25:55.423
and I finished your filing.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.425
Everything's alphabetical.
- Great.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.645
- Also, I quit.

26:00.863 --> 26:01.995
- Allegra, wait.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.214
- You know why
I was even out here?

26:04.258 --> 26:05.651
Enjoying the sun.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.783
You don't get much of that
in Iron Heights.

26:07.827 --> 26:10.046
I spent five years
locked up there,

26:10.090 --> 26:11.526
and it taught me how
to tell the difference

26:11.570 --> 26:13.397
between a snitch and a liar.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.790
You're not a snitch.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.183
- Allegra,
it's not what you think, okay?

26:16.226 --> 26:17.706
- Forget it.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.186
I've wasted enough time
behind bars.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.754
I'm not wasting any more
working for a liar.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.844
So be honest with me,
or I'm out of here.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.630
- Okay.
You're right.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.894
I was lying to you,
but I can't tell you the truth

26:31.938 --> 26:34.114
about Harrison Wells,
not yet.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.856
I do believe in you, Allegra.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.640
I think you have
great instincts,

26:38.684 --> 26:40.642
and I think you're gonna
make a great reporter.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.905
That's why I took
a chance on you.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.168
Now I'm asking you to take
a chance on me, okay?

26:45.212 --> 26:46.909
Trust me.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.346
When the time is right,
I will tell you everything.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.610
I promise.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.569
- We're journalists.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.353
It's our job
to tell people the truth,

26:56.397 --> 26:57.441
not control it,

26:57.485 --> 26:59.226
even if it's tough to say,

26:59.269 --> 27:00.706
or hard as hell to hear.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.622
Just saying, boss.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.932
See you in the morning.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.777
- Come to lecture me
some more?

27:28.821 --> 27:31.737
- Look, I know you think
that you fight better

27:31.780 --> 27:33.303
when you're angry,

27:33.347 --> 27:36.045
so why don't you try
and hit a real target?

27:36.089 --> 27:39.483
- ♪ I'm burning
all these secrets ♪

27:39.527 --> 27:43.313
♪ I'm burning
all these secrets ♪

27:49.624 --> 27:51.713
- Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me.

27:51.757 --> 27:52.845
Or why don't you just
admit the truth

27:52.888 --> 27:54.585
about what's hurting you?

27:58.633 --> 28:00.940
- I don't want to die
when I've just started living.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.463
Okay?

28:02.506 --> 28:05.031
I finally have the chance
to live a life,

28:05.074 --> 28:08.164
and now this stupid Crisis
is gonna take it all away?

28:08.208 --> 28:10.079
- I know it's not fair.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.515
- Do you know
that Baskin-Robbins

28:11.559 --> 28:13.909
has 31 different flavors?

28:13.953 --> 28:15.781
I might die
before I get to figure out

28:15.824 --> 28:17.521
which one is my favorite.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.914
Or what my favorite song is,

28:18.958 --> 28:21.743
or have my first
birthday party.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.833
30 years of existing,
and I have never had one.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.096
That really sucks.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.751
- Frost.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.753
There's always
gonna be a crisis,

28:31.797 --> 28:33.886
or some meta-human
that's threatening

28:33.929 --> 28:35.714
to take away the life
that you love.

28:37.367 --> 28:41.067
Truth is, we're all living
on borrowed time.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.765
- So, what, everybody feels
this crappy all the time?

28:46.159 --> 28:48.291
That actually does
kind of make me feel better.

28:48.335 --> 28:51.730
- It's why you can't let
the threat of losing tomorrow

28:51.773 --> 28:53.819
keep you from making the most
of today.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.519
- I want to spend
the rest of today

28:58.562 --> 29:01.740
making sure that Mitch Romero
doesn't hurt anyone else.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.810
- What are you?

30:20.906 --> 30:21.994
- Stop!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.434
Let me go.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.152
- Romero!

31:35.067 --> 31:36.372
- Ramsey, don't move.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.027
You want this?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.988
Yeah?

31:43.031 --> 31:45.120
Yeah, come and get it.
Come on.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.779
Come on.
Come and get it.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.215
Come on!

31:56.218 --> 31:59.526
Frost, Romero's heading
to the pipeline.

31:59.569 --> 32:00.527
Hey, there.
Come on.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.615
Yeah.

32:02.659 --> 32:03.922
- Come on.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.146
- Oh, I miss all the fun.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.974
- Next time we have to lock up
an undead meta,

32:13.018 --> 32:14.019
he's all yours.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.414
- Uh, Barry.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.486
Guess those meta-cuffs
would've been a waste of time.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.454
- Dark matter fuels his rage.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.066
- All right, get back.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.502
I'm gonna throw
a lightning bolt at him.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.069
- No, no, no,
I have a better idea.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.375
Get me all the dark matter
in Star Labs. Now.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.898
- That's gonna
make him stronger.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.161
- No, it's gonna
make him angry,

33:09.204 --> 33:10.423
and I'm pretty sure
if we give it to him,

33:10.466 --> 33:11.511
he'll overdose.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.469
Trust me.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.125
- Rage on this, Romero.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.150
- You were right.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.109
Anger really does
cloud judgment.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.597
- No breaks, just bruising.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.338
You got lucky.

33:56.382 --> 33:59.211
- I must be off.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.174
- Ramsey, hey, um...

34:06.218 --> 34:08.568
I know we didn't
see eye to eye today,

34:08.611 --> 34:12.311
but thanks for your help.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.661
If you ever want to talk...

34:14.704 --> 34:17.185
- Thanks, but I'm fine.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.274
See you in the next life,
Barry.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.284
- Thanks for coming, Mom.

34:29.328 --> 34:31.330
- You kidding?

34:31.373 --> 34:33.636
I'm just so grateful
you would see me.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.725
Can I go first?

34:35.769 --> 34:37.292
When your father left,

34:37.336 --> 34:41.383
you came into my room
every morning for a week

34:41.427 --> 34:45.344
with your hands on your hips,
and you said, "Where's Dad?"

34:46.301 --> 34:50.131
And I did not know how to tell
you he wasn't coming back.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.438
I was so worried

34:52.481 --> 34:56.311
that you would think it
was my fault, or worse, yours.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.096
And then when I did
tell you the truth,

34:58.139 --> 35:01.186
you were so mad.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.362
And so hurt.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.886
You could not believe
that he left

35:05.929 --> 35:07.757
without even saying good-bye.

35:11.413 --> 35:15.069
So a couple years later when my
boyfriend Doug and I broke up,

35:15.113 --> 35:17.637
and he left...

35:17.680 --> 35:19.769
there was no way
I was gonna put you

35:19.813 --> 35:21.510
through that pain again.

35:21.554 --> 35:25.123
You two had become
so close, and...

35:25.166 --> 35:27.255
- You lied to protect me.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.431
But, Mom...

35:29.475 --> 35:31.781
why did you break up
with all the others?

35:33.609 --> 35:36.960
- They always wanted more
than I could give.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.179
- You get scared.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.182
I know because
I'm the same way...

35:41.226 --> 35:43.228
Which is why
I made you something.

35:46.274 --> 35:50.322
An addendum
for "The Book of Ralph."

35:57.981 --> 36:01.202
- "22 steps

36:01.246 --> 36:04.205
to being open
to the love of your life."

36:05.598 --> 36:09.036
I'm open to love.
I'm just picky.

36:09.079 --> 36:12.126
- Mom, give me a break.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.563
Neither one of us have been
open to love since Dad left.

36:16.261 --> 36:20.395
And, Mom,
by keeping that pain away...

36:20.439 --> 36:23.268
we're also closing
ourselves off

36:23.311 --> 36:26.445
from the joy
that love can bring.

36:26.488 --> 36:30.057
- I don't think
I'm cut out for joy.

36:32.494 --> 36:37.282
But I want that joy for you,
Ralph.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.154
Love, happiness,
the whole kit and caboodle.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.243
I want you to go find that.

36:43.940 --> 36:48.467
And don't worry about me.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.208
Okay, Ralph?

36:50.251 --> 36:52.427
- Come on, Mom.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.605
I'll always be your Ralphy.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.364
- I now have a new theory.

37:16.408 --> 37:20.760
I believe I have found
an effective cure for HLH.

37:20.803 --> 37:23.502
One that would eliminate my
need for dark matter entirely.

37:38.778 --> 37:42.825
Analysis of Subject 1-A,
Mitch Romero's blood,

37:42.869 --> 37:44.131
reveals that dark matter

37:44.174 --> 37:46.394
infused
with healthy blood cells

37:46.438 --> 37:49.528
to create an even stronger
biological substance.

37:49.571 --> 37:52.748
This substance appears
to heal any and all weaknesses

37:52.792 --> 37:55.185
in the human body...

37:55.229 --> 37:58.493
including cells
affected by HLH.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.323
I will now commence
human trials.

38:37.097 --> 38:39.012
I need more.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.235
- ♪ Where my girls at?

38:56.899 --> 38:59.902
- Hey, sweetie, we having
a little get-together?

38:59.946 --> 39:02.949
- So Frost has never had
a birthday party,

39:02.992 --> 39:05.038
so I offered to throw her one.

39:05.081 --> 39:07.606
She picked the guest list.

39:07.649 --> 39:11.087
- It's my party,

39:32.631 --> 39:33.849

39:33.893 --> 39:35.503
You're missing out
on all the fun.

39:35.547 --> 39:36.809
Thanks for the party.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.421
- I'm thinking next year,

39:40.465 --> 39:42.510
we go whitewater rafting.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.470
- You should definitely
do that.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.995
- You're not gonna be
at my birthday party next year,

39:49.038 --> 39:50.823
are you?

39:50.866 --> 39:53.434
Whenever you talk
about life after Crisis,

39:53.478 --> 39:55.044
you never talk about yourself.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.484
You're gonna do more than just
vanish in Crisis, aren't you?

40:05.577 --> 40:07.622
- I don't know
how to tell them.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.104
- Try with me by your side.

40:13.585 --> 40:17.545
Barry, keeping this secret
all day hasn't felt right.

40:21.506 --> 40:24.813
Let's tell them together.

40:31.820 --> 40:35.215
Barry and I didn't share
everything that we learned

40:35.258 --> 40:38.566
about Crisis, and...

40:38.610 --> 40:40.829
you guys deserve
to know the truth.

40:43.049 --> 40:46.444
- The Monitor
didn't just warn us

40:46.487 --> 40:47.836
that Crisis was coming early.

40:47.880 --> 40:52.450
There was something else
that he said had to happen.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.929
When I projected
my mind forward,

40:53.973 --> 40:57.542
I saw billions
of possible futures.

40:59.544 --> 41:04.505
The only timeline
where everyone survives...

41:04.549 --> 41:06.159
was the one where I died.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.511
I have to die in Crisis.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.690
None of you
can try and save me.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.764
It's here.

42:09.091 --> 42:10.528
- Greg, move your head.
