WEBVTT

39:51.556 --> 39:55.602
Mouse.

39:55.644 --> 39:59.940
I thought
I'd never see you again.

46:47.096 --> 46:50.350
When you...

46:50.391 --> 46:52.435
When you disappeared
that night...

46:52.477 --> 46:55.146
I'm sorry.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.523
We were supposed to watch out
for each other

46:56.564 --> 46:58.399
and then you were gone.

47:04.531 --> 47:08.076
Shining Light sent me here.

47:08.117 --> 47:12.622
Put the needle in my spine

47:12.664 --> 47:15.708
and filled me full
of the blue poison.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.964
I should have found you.

47:21.005 --> 47:25.343
No. I'm the big sister. I should
have come back for you, but...

47:29.013 --> 47:32.517
...they made me into...

47:34.269 --> 47:37.730
...a monster.

47:40.316 --> 47:44.112
If that's true,
we're both monsters now.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.825
Did it hurt?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.077
I wanted to die.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.541
Me too.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.877
They had one dose left

47:59.919 --> 48:02.255
and they knew it worked on you

48:02.297 --> 48:05.800
so they figured
it would work on me.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.685
I'm sorry.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.354
It's not your fault.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.334
It's not your fault.

52:06.833 --> 52:10.628
These people you were with...

52:10.670 --> 52:13.297
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.804
Or we can go home.
Back to the village.

52:22.098 --> 52:23.850
There is no village anymore.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.227
What?

52:26.894 --> 52:28.229
They came for us.

52:28.271 --> 52:30.398
Who?

52:30.439 --> 52:31.649
The Americans.

52:31.691 --> 52:35.361
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

52:35.403 --> 52:38.781
Destroyed the camp. And all
the villages around it, too.

52:39.991 --> 52:42.159
There were bodies everywhere.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.871
Everyone's gone.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.832
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

52:47.874 --> 52:50.793
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.753
You don't care?

52:52.795 --> 52:55.256
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

52:56.674 --> 52:58.885
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

52:58.926 --> 53:00.261
That babies burned alive
in their cribs

53:00.303 --> 53:01.888
when the propane tanks exploded?

53:01.929 --> 53:05.308
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.518
Shining Light is full of shit!

53:07.560 --> 53:10.062
Shining Light fights injustice.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.772
They stand up for people
without a voice.

53:11.814 --> 53:15.192
They murdered our parents!

53:15.234 --> 53:17.320
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.240
We need to fight back.
Fight with me!

53:21.282 --> 53:26.662
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.875
That was a long time ago.

53:31.751 --> 53:34.712
You're still my brother.

53:36.297 --> 53:40.301
Then... you know
I have to do this.
