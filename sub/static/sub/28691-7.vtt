00:04.144 --> 00:06.406
<i>called </i> Ballroom Smash. <i>Becca is the host</i>

00:06.431 --> 00:09.066
- [and executive producer.]
- What happened to her morning show?

00:09.091 --> 00:11.192
Well, that's still going on.
This show is just

00:11.217 --> 00:13.112
a one-off special. But if it goes well,

00:13.137 --> 00:15.379
Becca says the network might
make it a regular event.

00:15.404 --> 00:16.253
[Cool!]

00:16.277 --> 00:17.566
So why does she want us there?

00:17.591 --> 00:18.836
[All she would say was]

00:18.861 --> 00:20.985
it's urgent. But fair warning,

00:21.010 --> 00:22.893
Becca might just want to
show off her new gig.

00:22.918 --> 00:25.687
Haha! OK. Well, I'll be
there in five minutes.

00:25.712 --> 00:27.299
- Can you grab me a...
- [Double-double, ]

00:27.324 --> 00:30.690
- [way ahead of you.]
- Here you go, sir.

00:31.224 --> 00:34.226
Liam! What are you doing here?

00:34.251 --> 00:36.219
I hired the kid. As of yesterday.

00:36.309 --> 00:38.775
Looks like we're gonna be seeing
a lot of each other now, sir.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.459
Hahahaha!

00:40.969 --> 00:43.169
City of millions, you hired Liam?!

00:43.194 --> 00:45.214
What can I tell you? I needed the help.

00:45.239 --> 00:47.557
Kid's a great worker.
Customers love him.

00:47.582 --> 00:50.893
And not just her.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.220
I'm gonna start going to Starbucks.

00:53.828 --> 00:56.096
Three, four, five,

00:56.121 --> 00:58.935
six, seven! One, three,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.651
five, seven, eight, one!

01:01.676 --> 01:04.404
♪ Ready set go We don't
stop until we're done ♪

01:04.429 --> 01:07.089
Becca pitched this show to the
networks three months ago.

01:07.114 --> 01:10.383
Celebrities paired up with
professional dancers one night only.

01:10.868 --> 01:14.618
Is that Brody Diamond? I had
such a crush on that guy.

01:14.643 --> 01:16.994
I didn't know you were
into country music.

01:17.019 --> 01:19.456
Who said anything about his music?

01:20.472 --> 01:23.484
OK. So, he's one of the contestants,

01:23.509 --> 01:26.504
- who are the others?
- We have tennis pro

01:26.529 --> 01:28.569
Jordan Pallister, uhh...

01:28.594 --> 01:32.982
stand-up comic Selena
Louise and Veronica Valor.

01:33.007 --> 01:36.376
No way! Veronica Valor
from <i>Rugged Landscapes?</i>

01:36.944 --> 01:38.558
The daytime soap?

01:38.583 --> 01:40.559
It's been on the air for 30 years.

01:40.854 --> 01:43.202
- It's Don's thing.
- Sure.

01:43.242 --> 01:45.898
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:45.923 --> 01:48.452
- Eddie!
- I know, I saw it!

01:48.477 --> 01:50.278
It's the wrong lighting cue.

01:50.303 --> 01:53.038
It goes group opening number,
then individual performances.

01:53.063 --> 01:55.765
And where is Kelly? Did he
get the phones working yet?

01:55.790 --> 01:57.163
How are people supposed
to call in and vote

01:57.188 --> 02:00.335
if they can't call in?

02:00.590 --> 02:03.707
Shade! Oh, Angie! Thank God!

02:03.732 --> 02:06.753
Becca! You seem stressed.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.663
Stressed? Ha! Why? Oh,
is it because we go live

02:09.687 --> 02:12.304
in less than 72 hours and
people keep asking me

02:12.329 --> 02:14.218
where the judges sit?!

02:14.243 --> 02:16.257
There are no judges on this show.

02:16.282 --> 02:18.530
So, how can we help?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.143
I need you guys to
investigate some incidents.

02:21.168 --> 02:24.304
- Could you be more specific?
- Key wardrobe went missing,

02:24.329 --> 02:26.530
one of the dressing rooms'
flooded, and yesterday

02:26.547 --> 02:28.482
a light set a curtain on fire.

02:28.507 --> 02:31.491
Sounds like you need a closet,
a plumber and an electrician.

02:31.516 --> 02:33.450
- Hmm...
- These are not accidents.

02:33.475 --> 02:35.738
Someone is trying to ruin this show

02:35.763 --> 02:37.444
and tank my big shot.

02:37.469 --> 02:40.179
Becca, I would be remiss
if I didn't point out

02:40.204 --> 02:43.460
the fact that you tend
to overdramatize things

02:43.485 --> 02:45.686
- when you get stressed.
- What he's trying to say is

02:45.711 --> 02:48.128
it's all in your head.

02:48.153 --> 02:50.047
Clear the stage!

02:50.502 --> 02:52.970
Clear the stage! Clear the stage!

- All good?

03:42.686 --> 03:44.348
Every day, it's something
new at this place.

03:44.383 --> 03:45.850
I mean, how can we be
expected to perform

03:45.875 --> 03:47.631
under circumstances like this?

03:47.656 --> 03:48.780
Yeah, we're going to look like idiots

03:48.805 --> 03:51.513
- in front of millions of people.
- Assuming we make it that far.

03:51.538 --> 03:54.671
OK, guys, please. We will
get to the bottom of this.

03:54.898 --> 03:57.127
Why don't you all just go
back to your dressing rooms

03:57.152 --> 03:59.411
and we will call you
in a few minutes, OK?

03:59.436 --> 04:01.218
Thank you.

04:04.996 --> 04:08.018
OK, this is really weird. Those
were just put up this morning.

04:08.043 --> 04:09.978
You know, maybe the wiring's faulty.

04:10.003 --> 04:11.971
There's nothing wrong
with the wiring, Shadow.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.589
You guys need to look into this.

04:14.614 --> 04:16.257
Alright, we'll look into it.

04:17.059 --> 04:19.320
Oh, but keep a low profile, OK?

04:19.345 --> 04:21.483
No one can know why you're here.
Everyone's already freaked out

04:21.507 --> 04:24.820
- enough about this damn curse.
- "Curse"?

04:24.845 --> 04:26.813
Some stupid ghost story.

04:26.838 --> 04:28.615
I heard some of the crew talking.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.063
Something about an actor who died here.

04:37.749 --> 04:40.231
[Grover Newell. He performed <i>Hamlet]</i>

04:40.256 --> 04:42.287
[at the Bellecroft over
a hundred years ago.]

04:42.312 --> 04:44.304
Zoe, you sound terrible.

04:44.329 --> 04:46.730
I'm fine. I've been
taking cold medicine.

04:46.755 --> 04:48.665
I also swallowed some garlic,
and I have raw onions

04:48.690 --> 04:50.668
[wrapped around my neck.
All good things.]

04:50.693 --> 04:52.995
[So, opening night]

04:53.020 --> 04:55.088
[during the "To be or
not to be" speech, ]

04:55.113 --> 04:57.781
he freezes up so badly
the audiences breaks out

04:57.806 --> 04:59.773
into hysterics. After the show,

04:59.798 --> 05:02.136
he hung himself in the theatre.

05:02.161 --> 05:05.058
- Charming.
- [To even speak his name, ]

05:05.083 --> 05:06.726
is to invite death and destruction

05:06.751 --> 05:09.038
- [upon your head.]
- Death <i>and </i> destruction?

05:09.063 --> 05:10.077
Haha!

05:10.102 --> 05:12.271
Don't mock what you don't understand.

05:12.296 --> 05:14.413
I think we'll stick to human suspects.

05:14.438 --> 05:16.068
Thanks, Zoe. Get some rest.

05:16.093 --> 05:17.660
[Well, fine. If you're gonna
go down that route, ]

05:17.685 --> 05:20.648
- my money's on Jeffrey Sanders.
- [Jeffrey Sanders, ]

05:20.673 --> 05:22.749
the weatherman at Becca's network?

05:22.774 --> 05:24.953
Don't you ever read <i>FameChatter?</i>

05:24.978 --> 05:28.765
Showbiz insider dirt.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.623
Sent you an article.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.585
"Meteorological Meltdown:
Stormchaser Loses Bid

05:37.610 --> 05:39.678
for Hogtown Hoofer Hijinks."

05:39.933 --> 05:41.801
Oh! Well, that explains everything.

05:41.826 --> 05:44.225
[The network was developing
<i>Ballroom Smash</i> with an eye]

05:44.250 --> 05:47.419
on Jeffrey Sanders for hosting,
but at the last minute,

05:47.444 --> 05:50.936
they switched gears and
gave the show to Becca.

05:56.614 --> 05:59.402
Which means clear skies
all weekend long.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.738
And that... a Jeffrey Sanders promise.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.324
Back to you, Marissa.

06:05.867 --> 06:08.660
Aren't you worried your face
is gonna stay like that?

06:09.177 --> 06:11.627
Let me guess, you're here about Becca.

06:11.652 --> 06:13.720
Come on, Jeffrey, it
was all over the news.

06:13.745 --> 06:16.007
You wanted to be the
host of <i>Ballroom Smash.</i>

06:16.032 --> 06:18.600
Live dance competition with
you as the host, that's

06:18.625 --> 06:20.759
- a step up from weatherman.
- Oh, I admit it would have been

06:20.783 --> 06:22.866
a feather in my <i>chapeau,
but I'm over it now.</i>

06:22.892 --> 06:25.219
I wished dear Beckster all
the luck in the world.

06:25.244 --> 06:27.410
<i>FameChatter said you
threatened to sue the network.</i>

06:27.435 --> 06:29.452
Of course they did. They're
all about the clickbait.

06:29.477 --> 06:31.558
- So you're not upset?
- Oh, on the contrary.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.093
It is my fondest desire
that <i>Ballroom Smash</i>

06:34.118 --> 06:37.749
is a smashing success,
catapulting Becca's career

06:37.774 --> 06:39.663
- into the stratosphere.
- In which case,

06:39.688 --> 06:41.600
she'll be too busy for her morning show.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.614
And the station

06:42.639 --> 06:44.997
will need to hire a new host
for <i>Breakfast with Becca.</i>

06:45.022 --> 06:48.030
<i>Sunrise with Sanders</i> anyone?
So please, pass along

06:48.055 --> 06:51.579
my best wishes. Oh! And, uh...
on the QT,

06:51.604 --> 06:53.494
let her know that the
new network head is

06:53.519 --> 06:56.366
not too happy about the
recent cost overruns.

06:56.391 --> 06:58.538
You're saying <i>Ballroom
Smash</i> is over budget?

06:58.563 --> 07:01.106
Between the contestant demands,
the production setbacks

07:01.131 --> 07:05.507
and Becca's nonstop tweaking,
it is the perfect storm.

07:05.686 --> 07:09.346
And Beckster is sitting right
in the path of the hurricane.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.273
<i>Shadow! Great to finally meet you!</i>

07:14.298 --> 07:15.830
<i>Steve Sato, head of programming.</i>

07:15.855 --> 07:19.523
Ha! Is this... what
they mean by ergonomic?

07:19.549 --> 07:22.193
It's another brainstorm
from the old regime.

07:22.218 --> 07:25.070
But that's all changing now.

07:25.209 --> 07:27.443
This is a workplace, not a playground.

07:27.468 --> 07:29.714
Oh, sounds like you got

07:29.762 --> 07:32.166
- a lot of changes in the works.
- Latest news

07:32.191 --> 07:34.283
from <i>FameChatter</i> is that you're
axing all your predecessor's

07:34.308 --> 07:36.812
- TV series.
- It's time for a fresh start.

07:37.169 --> 07:39.918
I have a vision for this network and...

07:41.219 --> 07:43.423
Wave your arms.

07:48.503 --> 07:52.106
Motion sensors. Part of our
green-building initiative.

07:52.131 --> 07:54.299
And what about <i>Ballroom Smash?</i>

07:54.324 --> 07:57.561
- Is that part of your new vision?
- Absolutely. Why?

07:57.586 --> 08:00.622
- We heard about your recent series
of setbacks: budget overages...

08:00.647 --> 08:02.481
Every show goes through growing pains.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.612
Between you and me, we've sunk
so much money into this thing;

08:05.637 --> 08:07.672
if it were to fail now,
I'd be out the door

08:07.697 --> 08:10.358
faster than you can say forced hiatus.
Hahaha!

Steve Sato.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.068
[Jordan Pallister's
agent is here for you.]

08:15.093 --> 08:17.195
Park him at the rooftop juicery,

08:17.220 --> 08:19.188
my usual table by the living wall.

08:19.538 --> 08:22.616
"Jordan Pallister," isn't he a
contestant on <i>Ballroom Smash?</i>

08:22.759 --> 08:24.026
For now.

08:24.051 --> 08:26.085
His agent's trying to
break our contract.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.671
Apparently, he's got

08:27.696 --> 08:30.304
a new endorsement for a
German tennis racket.

08:30.329 --> 08:32.354
What does that have to
do with <i>Ballroom Smash?</i>

08:32.379 --> 08:34.716
His people are worried
that a dance show is

08:34.741 --> 08:37.383
gonna diminish his street
cred, put the deal at risk.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.655
Too bad, we've got him locked in.

08:39.822 --> 08:43.193
- Whether he likes it or not.
- Like I said, this is business,

08:43.219 --> 08:45.124
and no one's gonna stand in my way

08:45.436 --> 08:47.486
of my plans for this network.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.755
I hate this building.

09:01.861 --> 09:04.378
Hey, sweetie! Hahaha!

09:04.403 --> 09:07.339
Mwah! We're not here to
fraternize with the staff?

09:07.491 --> 09:09.507
Labour law say he gets
two 15-minute breaks

09:09.532 --> 09:10.724
and a half-hour for lunch.

09:10.749 --> 09:13.952
Oh! Well, OK then.

09:13.977 --> 09:15.882
Hey! What a great surprise!

09:15.907 --> 09:17.434
Uh, yeah, I actually
need to talk to you.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.327
I know you want to see a movie tomorrow,

09:19.352 --> 09:21.219
but can I get a rain cheque?
Justine asked

09:21.244 --> 09:23.257
- if I could help her study.
- Yeah, no problem.

09:23.282 --> 09:25.491
Your grandfather asked if I
could work a double anyway.

09:25.516 --> 09:27.398
He wants me to learn how
to make something called,

09:27.423 --> 09:29.452
um, Fort Huron gumbo.

09:29.788 --> 09:31.530
It's a 200-year-old recipe

09:31.555 --> 09:33.289
with an incredible story behind it.

09:33.314 --> 09:35.319
I'll tell you about it. Just
hang on, I'll be right back.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.452
Incredible the first
10 times you hear it.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.749
- See you tonight?
- Yeah, absolutely.

09:39.774 --> 09:41.874
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:57.824 --> 10:00.600
You really think Jordan is the
one behind all these incidents?

10:00.625 --> 10:02.819
He's afraid he'll
jeopardize his lucrative

10:02.844 --> 10:05.054
German endorsement deal
if he sticks around.

10:05.079 --> 10:07.524
And since the network isn't
giving him an inch...

10:07.549 --> 10:09.735
He's taking matters into his own hands.

10:10.613 --> 10:13.042
Well, if that glorified

10:13.067 --> 10:14.913
ping-pong player thinks
he can tank my show

10:14.938 --> 10:17.117
just because he got a
higher-paying gig...

10:21.813 --> 10:24.875
- Look out!
- Oh! Oh! Look out!

10:25.969 --> 10:28.539
Ugh! Oh, my leg!

10:28.564 --> 10:30.218
Get the set EMT down here right away!

10:30.243 --> 10:32.592
- Oh, my God! Are you OK?
- I think I broke my leg.

10:33.157 --> 10:34.594
There goes our prime suspect.

10:34.619 --> 10:36.587
Hurry up! Come on over here! Lift!

10:36.829 --> 10:38.830
- OK, don't move.
- On three, lift.

10:38.854 --> 10:41.443
Don't move. Careful.

10:41.593 --> 10:44.085
OK, he's clear. Throw that
sandbag underneath it.

10:44.336 --> 10:45.604
Shade?

10:48.804 --> 10:50.883
- Got something?
- It's a clean cut.

10:50.915 --> 10:53.571
- This rope's been scored.
- Yeah, this was no accident.

10:53.835 --> 10:57.200
Whoever's behind this, they're
stepping up their game.

11:02.210 --> 11:03.600
Hey!

11:04.064 --> 11:05.865
Hey. How did it go?

11:05.890 --> 11:08.600
Better than I thought. I
mean, I fully expected them

11:08.625 --> 11:10.338
to cancel the show entirely,

11:10.630 --> 11:12.779
Luckily, Steve was there to back me up.

11:12.804 --> 11:15.372
So what are they gonna do?
Postpone it a week?

11:15.703 --> 11:18.596
No, we're still going live in 48 hours.

11:18.621 --> 11:21.265
With only three contestants?
I thought Jordan was out.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.257
Oh yeah, he is. The hospital called

11:23.282 --> 11:25.684
- to confirm he broke his leg.
- Hmm.

11:26.389 --> 11:29.323
But the good news is

11:29.348 --> 11:31.788
I managed to convince the
network that we have

11:31.813 --> 11:34.848
a very strong substitute.

11:37.407 --> 11:39.663
- You can't be serious.
- You were always

11:39.688 --> 11:41.225
a great mover on the ice, Shade.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.975
- No. Absolutely no way!
- But Jordan was

11:44.000 --> 11:46.829
a tennis player, you were a
hockey player. Same same.

11:46.854 --> 11:49.772
Besides the fact that
that is entirely untrue,

11:49.797 --> 11:52.499
you're forgetting the
fact that I cannot dance!

11:52.546 --> 11:56.249
You'll be fine! You're paired
with Raven, and she's the best.

11:56.376 --> 11:58.945
And besides, nobody expects the
celebrities to be any good.

11:58.970 --> 12:01.721
I'm also not into public humiliation.

12:01.746 --> 12:03.788
Since when? Come on, Shade,

12:03.813 --> 12:06.124
this is the only way I could get
them to not cancel the show.

12:06.288 --> 12:08.652
And look, this way, you
could be on the inside.

12:08.677 --> 12:10.796
You know, you could be
my eyes and ears and...

12:10.821 --> 12:12.013
Not selling it, Becca.

12:12.038 --> 12:14.473
I'm sorry. I know this
means a lot to you,

12:14.498 --> 12:16.112
but every man has his limit,

12:16.137 --> 12:18.738
and mine is dancing.

12:19.497 --> 12:22.531
How do I look?

12:23.959 --> 12:25.538
You're trying not to laugh, aren't you?

12:25.563 --> 12:27.731
Oh, come on, this is serious!

12:27.756 --> 12:29.311
Please don't say, "This is serious"

12:29.336 --> 12:32.523
- wearing that outfit.
- Look, we have a case

12:32.548 --> 12:34.725
with no suspect and
now, thanks to Becca,

12:34.750 --> 12:37.905
I am right in the line of fire.
In more ways than one.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.749
OK. Uh... look,

12:39.774 --> 12:42.804
I've been thinking about this.
The missing wardrobe,

12:42.829 --> 12:45.070
the flood, the exploding light boxes;

12:45.094 --> 12:47.190
those were either nuisances
or scare tactics,

12:47.215 --> 12:49.530
but this last one, that
was a definite attack.

12:49.889 --> 12:52.632
Do you think someone's trying
to take out Jordan Pallister?

12:52.657 --> 12:55.151
It makes sense. According
to the show's website,

12:55.176 --> 12:57.298
he is the odds-on favourite
to win the whole competition.

12:57.323 --> 12:59.613
And with a half-a-million dollar
cash prize on the line...

12:59.638 --> 13:01.805
That's half a million reasons
to take out the frontrunner.

13:01.830 --> 13:04.100
Now, all we gotta do is get close enough

13:04.125 --> 13:06.552
to the other three
contestants to figure out

13:06.577 --> 13:08.875
which one of them needs
that 500K the most.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.577
Actually, they all do.

13:10.602 --> 13:12.320
Becca sent over some
background information

13:12.345 --> 13:14.099
on the remaining three contestants.

13:14.124 --> 13:17.660
Turns out that Brody Diamond has
a bit of a spending problem.

13:17.693 --> 13:19.312
Hasn't had a hit for a while.

13:19.337 --> 13:22.802
And... Veronica Valor is being
written out of <i>Rugged Landscapes.</i>

13:22.827 --> 13:24.624
What?! She...

13:26.191 --> 13:28.772
That's terrible. For her.

13:28.901 --> 13:31.068
Um, what about Selena Louise,

13:31.093 --> 13:33.438
- the comedian?
- No debts,

13:33.463 --> 13:34.929
but she's the least famous of the three.

13:34.954 --> 13:37.890
She's actually got the most
to gain by winning the prize.

13:39.896 --> 13:42.257
- What's that?
- What?

13:42.424 --> 13:43.990
That.

13:44.508 --> 13:48.203
Oh, that's just something
that Zoe e-mailed

13:48.228 --> 13:52.708
over here. It's a picture of the
Bellecroft Theatre's ghost.

13:52.997 --> 13:55.543
And you put it on our
case board because...?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.554
I'm just trying to keep
all our suspects alive.

13:57.579 --> 14:00.841
- Haha!
- Human suspects, Shade.

14:01.592 --> 14:05.185
- And don't forget your cape.
- Hahahaha!

14:05.210 --> 14:06.491
Aaaah...

14:06.516 --> 14:10.046
Taxi!

14:32.659 --> 14:35.261
Hey, Brody Diamond. Matt Shade.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.085
- Welcome to the <i>Smash, </i> partner.
- Hey, thanks.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.663
Gallant move stepping up for the ex.

14:38.688 --> 14:40.281
Ah, thanks. I wish it was just

14:40.306 --> 14:43.258
- under better circumstances.
- Yeah, bummer about Jordan.

14:43.413 --> 14:45.257
Sets falling, lights exploding;

14:45.282 --> 14:46.679
people are saying the show is cursed.

14:46.704 --> 14:48.609
Whatever. I'm keeping
both eyes on the prize.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.936
I hear you. It's a lot
of money at stake,

14:50.961 --> 14:52.350
and money makes people do

14:52.392 --> 14:54.611
- crazy things.
- Hey, you got no worries there.

14:54.636 --> 14:56.610
My new single drops the day we go live.

14:56.635 --> 14:58.899
- Ticket back to the big time.
- Hmm...

14:58.924 --> 15:00.859
That sounds like you're
back in the saddle.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.563
You got that right.

15:02.728 --> 15:04.735
I gotta admit I had a
little debt scare there,

15:04.760 --> 15:06.634
but this new single's gonna
take care of all of that

15:06.659 --> 15:08.509
and more.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.711
- Who left this here?
- You!

15:12.860 --> 15:14.789
- You've been avoiding me!
- Ummm...

15:14.814 --> 15:17.616
You know, enough talk. Go
get some workout gear on.

15:17.641 --> 15:20.309
- Well, I-I thought we should...
- I have less than a day

15:20.334 --> 15:23.619
to turn a gorilla into a gazelle.
Get ready to sweat.

15:23.644 --> 15:26.346
- Oh, whoa, wow! OK, sure.
- Yep, let go.

15:28.049 --> 15:30.494
If I have to die for this, I will,

15:30.519 --> 15:33.017
but you're all going down with me.

15:33.407 --> 15:35.276
Uh... hello?

15:36.552 --> 15:38.686
Oh! You're reading a script.

15:38.711 --> 15:40.940
Oh. Yes, it's, uh...

15:40.965 --> 15:43.814
it's my lines for next week.

15:45.197 --> 15:48.330
- Who are you?
- I'm Angie from the network.

15:48.355 --> 15:49.385
I...

15:49.410 --> 15:51.963
I just heard that you were being
written off <i>Rugged Landscapes,</i>

15:51.988 --> 15:54.573
- and I wanted to check in.
- Yeah.

15:54.598 --> 15:58.666
Well, 22 years on their stupid show...

15:59.640 --> 16:01.920
never a single day late,

16:02.047 --> 16:03.651
all the pathetic words

16:03.676 --> 16:06.175
I had to vomit out of my mouth,

16:06.200 --> 16:08.044
and my reward? I'm being

16:08.069 --> 16:10.940
killed off by my half-brother's twin

16:10.965 --> 16:14.026
- who turns out to be an alien.
- Wow!

16:14.162 --> 16:16.049
Well, I'm sure winning
half a million dollars

16:16.074 --> 16:18.900
on this show would certainly
help soften the blow.

16:18.925 --> 16:21.978
Yeah, well, the charity I'm sponsoring
wouldn't know what hit 'em.

16:22.003 --> 16:25.239
- Charity?
- Yeah, the Goodwell League.

16:25.479 --> 16:27.759
They're a charity for endangered animals

16:27.784 --> 16:29.963
who aren't cute and cuddly.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.666
Oh!

16:32.126 --> 16:33.786
Well, good luck.

16:36.306 --> 16:38.782
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:38.807 --> 16:41.502
We go one, two, three, four,

16:41.527 --> 16:43.713
five, six seven, eight.

16:43.738 --> 16:45.039
Around!

16:45.064 --> 16:46.531
Step, throw, reach.

16:46.676 --> 16:48.500
I'll come all the way over here,

16:48.525 --> 16:50.250
and then we'll go into the Widow's Leap,

16:50.275 --> 16:51.931
which will be our grand finale.

16:51.956 --> 16:54.490
And if you mess this up
by the tiniest margin,

16:54.713 --> 16:56.214
I will die, so...

16:56.239 --> 16:58.969
Whoa, hold on. Are you sure
this is the smartest idea?

16:58.994 --> 17:02.922
No weakness. You have to
master it or we don't win.

17:03.264 --> 17:05.101
Now, let's begin.

17:05.421 --> 17:08.194
- Ready?
- As I'll ever be.

17:09.513 --> 17:12.992
- Oh!
- Oh!

17:14.223 --> 17:16.090
You're OK?

17:16.116 --> 17:18.515
Matthew, you're better than this!

17:18.540 --> 17:20.915
Yeah, a jury's still out on that.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.517
Oh, hey, could you give me a second?

17:27.861 --> 17:29.940
I don't wait. We'll meet
tonight, your place.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.354
My place?

17:31.379 --> 17:33.887
8 p.m. sharp. Text me your address.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.806
OK.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.654
Well, she's tough, but
you look pretty good.

17:39.679 --> 17:42.270
Wow! Compliment from Angie Everett.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.119
Have you talked to our sexy cowboy yet?

17:44.144 --> 17:46.346
Brody, really?

17:46.479 --> 17:48.916
Nah, he's not our guy. His new single is

17:48.941 --> 17:51.470
about to drop making him flush again.
What about Veronica?

17:51.495 --> 17:53.182
Money's not a motive for her either.

17:53.207 --> 17:56.358
She plans on donating her prize
money to a bunch of hairless cats.

17:56.383 --> 17:57.828
- Huh...
- Yeah.

17:57.853 --> 18:00.705
Well, that leaves Selena.

18:01.064 --> 18:03.885
Matt Shade! Welcome to the suck!

18:03.910 --> 18:06.612
- Hahaha! Hey, Selena.
- Hi.

18:06.637 --> 18:08.881
- This is Angie. She's...
- From the network.

18:08.906 --> 18:12.088
- I'm just popping by.
- Uh-oh! Did they send you

18:12.113 --> 18:14.470
to look into all the crap that's
been going on around here.

18:14.495 --> 18:17.086
- Were you here when the set fell?
- What can I say?

18:17.111 --> 18:19.079
My mom always told me to avoid a crowd.

18:19.104 --> 18:22.268
Besides, the best way to
make an entrance is alone.

18:22.777 --> 18:25.736
You don't know what's causing
'em, do you, the incidents?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.276
Is that what you'd call them?

18:28.486 --> 18:31.021
I'm sure you've heard
about our fab phantom.

18:31.328 --> 18:34.405
- Grover...
- Don't say it! Sorry. Haha!

18:34.430 --> 18:36.432
I just want to stay on the
spooky guy's good side.

18:36.457 --> 18:37.526
You know what I mean?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.095
When you're as uncoordinated as me,

18:39.120 --> 18:41.205
you need all the help you can get, so...

18:41.230 --> 18:43.499
Of course. Makes total sense.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.294
Gustavo's waiting, I
should get to it, so...

18:48.854 --> 18:51.456
I don't know, she seems
genuinely freaked out

18:51.481 --> 18:54.017
- by the whole ghost thing.
- Or it's a kickass

18:54.042 --> 18:56.469
- diversionary tactic.
- How are we gonna find out?

18:56.874 --> 18:58.679
There's a ton of cameras in this place,

18:58.704 --> 19:01.058
there's gotta be one that
caught the saboteur in the act.

19:01.752 --> 19:03.309
I'll check back in with you

19:03.334 --> 19:05.144
after you shower.

19:07.899 --> 19:09.900
Excuse me, are you an editor?

19:09.925 --> 19:12.479
I prefer the term creative closer.

19:12.504 --> 19:15.531
Oh! Whoa! Your cologne.

19:15.556 --> 19:17.307
It's not 'cause I smoked weed.

19:17.332 --> 19:19.593
I... I wear cologne 'cause
I like to smell nice,

19:19.618 --> 19:21.552
not 'cause I smoke weed.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.664
OK, yeah. Whatever the reason,
I offer the same advice:

19:24.689 --> 19:26.667
a little goes a long way.

19:26.692 --> 19:28.893
Anyhow, listen, I need to see footage

19:28.918 --> 19:31.004
from the set fall and
the popping lights.

19:31.029 --> 19:32.791
Are you nuts? I have no time for that.

19:32.816 --> 19:35.175
I'm assembling new promos
from scratch for air tonight.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.334
- I'm sorry, what was your name?
- Sami.

19:37.359 --> 19:39.556
Great. So when I call my
boss from the network back,

19:39.581 --> 19:41.548
I'll just tell 'em
Sami said it's a no go

19:41.573 --> 19:44.182
- on seeing footage.
- OK, OK. Hahaha!

19:44.448 --> 19:46.916
Uh, what exactly do you need to see?

19:47.396 --> 19:49.431
We're looking for a ghost.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.315
You shouldn't say that.

19:51.502 --> 19:53.370
The curse of you know who

19:53.395 --> 19:55.296
is not something to be messed
with at Bellecroft Theatre.

20:04.963 --> 20:06.631
Wait. There. That one.

20:06.718 --> 20:08.584
Hang on, I'll get a better angle.

20:09.471 --> 20:11.878
- Oh, my God!
- Is that Steve?

20:12.004 --> 20:13.771
Head of programming at the network.

20:14.352 --> 20:16.216
This isn't sabotage at all;

20:16.241 --> 20:18.176
it's all part of the act.

20:26.582 --> 20:28.876
♪ There's a place for worry ♪

20:28.901 --> 20:31.607
Ah, hey, kid. What's up?

20:31.632 --> 20:33.941
Somebody dine and dash?

20:34.643 --> 20:36.612
Jules, uh...

20:36.675 --> 20:39.377
she told me she was studying
with her friend Justine tonight.

20:39.402 --> 20:42.826
- OK, so what's with the face?
- I just found a message.

20:42.851 --> 20:45.086
Um, I think she butt-dialed me.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.830
Uh, called me

20:46.855 --> 20:48.831
by accident, sir.

20:52.615 --> 20:54.128
Can I hear it?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.131
Yeah.

20:57.145 --> 20:59.279
<i>- Having a good time?
- Definitely!</i>

20:59.304 --> 21:01.108
<i>- This is awesome!
- Where's</i>

21:01.133 --> 21:03.120
<i>- your boyfriend tonight?
- I don't think</i>

21:03.145 --> 21:05.766
<i>it'd be into this. His taste
in music is a little vanilla.</i>

21:06.313 --> 21:08.781
What should I do?

21:08.806 --> 21:11.207
Well, I'm not sure it's my place

21:11.232 --> 21:14.888
to offer you advice, Liam.
But if it were,

21:14.937 --> 21:17.777
I think I'd give her a chance
to come clean on her own.

21:17.802 --> 21:20.035
- ♪ But please take my love ♪
- OK.

21:22.863 --> 21:24.570
<i>I don't get it.</i>

21:24.595 --> 21:28.004
[Why would Steve Sato sabotage
his own network show?]

21:28.029 --> 21:29.831
Think about it. He
needed a hit to solidify

21:29.856 --> 21:32.667
his new position. You've
seen those reality TV shows,

21:32.692 --> 21:34.504
[what drives ratings
more than anything.]

21:34.529 --> 21:36.997
- Drama and fighting.
- [Exactly.]

21:37.022 --> 21:39.113
So he uses the ghost story
to scare up some tension,

21:39.138 --> 21:41.426
only he takes it too far
and someone gets hurt.

21:41.451 --> 21:43.512
Wait a minute, why are you
still working on this case?

21:43.537 --> 21:45.082
[You're supposed to
rest and get better.]

21:45.107 --> 21:48.015
Nah. I've been drinking this Cold
Crusher tea, and it turns out

21:48.040 --> 21:50.325
it's jam-packed with amphetamines!

21:50.350 --> 21:52.478
[I have never been so
productive in my life.]

21:52.503 --> 21:54.838
[I cleaned up my freezer,
resorted the spice rack.]

21:54.863 --> 21:56.848
I've even started writing a novella.

21:56.873 --> 21:59.107
- Oh, boy.
- [But first, ]

21:59.570 --> 22:00.793
some more information

22:00.818 --> 22:03.073
on you know who.

22:03.228 --> 22:05.909
Grover Newell? You can
say his name, Zoe.

22:05.934 --> 22:09.079
- "Beware the bare bodkin."
- [Ha!]

22:09.104 --> 22:11.151
My dad gave me that same
advice on prom night.

22:11.176 --> 22:13.249
[It's from <i>Hamlet. It means dagger.]</i>

22:13.482 --> 22:15.251
Twice over the past hundred years,

22:15.276 --> 22:17.249
a performer found a similar dagger

22:17.274 --> 22:19.006
in their dressing room
at the Bellecroft,

22:19.031 --> 22:22.133
and both performers died
during the run of the show.

22:22.311 --> 22:24.720
- Fascinating.
- [I'm just warning you.]

22:24.745 --> 22:26.304
[Be careful.]

22:26.847 --> 22:29.982
OK. Sato's leaving,
I'm gonna follow him.

22:30.007 --> 22:31.778
OK, OK! But remember what I told you.

22:31.803 --> 22:33.670
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Beware
the bare bodkin."

22:41.436 --> 22:44.655
<i>OK, hips forward. Show me your frame.</i>

22:46.016 --> 22:48.948
That's it. Ready? Three, four,

22:48.973 --> 22:50.918
five, six, seven, eight.

22:50.943 --> 22:54.749
One, two, three, four, and up!

22:54.983 --> 22:56.488
Ugh! You know what?

22:56.513 --> 22:58.903
This is ridiculous. Jordan had 6 weeks

22:58.928 --> 23:00.995
to learn this routine; I've
got less than 24 hours.

23:01.020 --> 23:03.655
- Now, just focus on my eyes.
- OK.

23:04.180 --> 23:08.004
- Which one?
- Surrender to the dance.

23:08.029 --> 23:10.460
Find the place where you can't hide.

23:10.485 --> 23:13.278
OK. Am I finding or am I hiding?

23:13.303 --> 23:14.622
You're not even trying.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.808
I'm surprised you even want to continue.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.034
Aren't you scared that
someone is sabotaging

23:19.059 --> 23:21.193
- the show?
- I'm too focused on winning;

23:21.218 --> 23:23.018
I'll be scared later.

23:23.043 --> 23:24.910
What if that set fall
wasn't an accident?

23:24.935 --> 23:27.616
Wasn't aimed at me. I wasn't
even supposed to be rehearsing.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.473
Jordan and I got switched
at the last minute.

23:30.498 --> 23:32.829
- By who?
- Uh...

23:33.140 --> 23:34.582
Sato.

23:34.607 --> 23:38.085
OK, enough talking. Let go from the top.

23:39.873 --> 23:41.484
I said, "No phones!"

23:41.509 --> 23:43.004
Uh, yeah. You know what?

23:43.029 --> 23:46.676
I really gotta take this.
Just give me one second, OK?

23:50.348 --> 23:52.816
Hey. I haven't heard from
you in hours, are you OK?

23:52.850 --> 23:56.277
- [Where have you been?]
- Oh, tailing our suspect.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.579
- You see anything on the tape?
- [Oddly enough, ]

23:58.604 --> 24:00.129
the network guy, Steve.

24:00.154 --> 24:02.601
[Maybe not so odd after all.
I just heard]

24:02.626 --> 24:05.003
that he's the one who changed
the rehearsal schedule,

24:05.028 --> 24:07.043
so that Jordan and Raven were the ones

24:07.068 --> 24:08.401
on the stage when the set fell.

24:08.426 --> 24:10.012
Well, I bet you can't
guess where he went.

24:10.037 --> 24:11.185
Bellecroft Theatre?

24:11.210 --> 24:13.478
If only you were that fast on your feet.

24:13.503 --> 24:14.950
What's he doing there at this hour?

24:14.975 --> 24:16.730
He ain't here for the culture.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.043
[Hey, you wouldn't be able]

24:19.068 --> 24:21.527
- [to tear yourself away from...?]
- I'll be right there.

24:57.276 --> 25:00.090
OK. Possible bad call.

25:03.865 --> 25:05.711
- Hey.
- Oh, Shade.

25:05.736 --> 25:07.637
I ran here as fast as I could.
Where is Steve?

25:07.662 --> 25:09.997
He went backstage. Stay close.

25:10.367 --> 25:12.335
A little jumpy, huh?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.122
Yeah. Nothing like a spooky theatre

25:14.147 --> 25:15.684
in the dead of night to make you rethink

25:15.709 --> 25:18.262
the whole ghost angle.
You know, Grover...

25:18.287 --> 25:19.778
Shhh! You're not supposed to say

25:19.803 --> 25:21.340
his name out loud in here, remember?

25:21.365 --> 25:23.246
He's the least of our worries, Shade.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.746
Grover Newell, Grover
Newell, Grover Newell.

25:25.771 --> 25:27.507
♪ Shake your body Shake your body ♪

25:27.532 --> 25:29.622
- ♪ Let go ♪
- Look! Up there!

25:29.647 --> 25:32.079
- Did you see that?
- I sure did.

25:34.374 --> 25:37.188
Whatever we see in here,
we're gonna be OK, right?

25:37.213 --> 25:40.540
Yeah... sure.

25:49.601 --> 25:52.219
- Shadow!
- Becca!

25:53.494 --> 25:55.790
Looks like he found another
way to turn on the lights.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.641
Haha! Ahem!

25:59.088 --> 26:01.645
<i>I'm sorry you had to find
out this way, Shadow.</i>

26:01.782 --> 26:03.170
I'm sure it was a bit of a shock

26:03.195 --> 26:05.600
- for you.
- Yeah, it was a bit of a shock.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.170
Why didn't you just tell me?

26:07.195 --> 26:09.599
Because I wanted you to take the case.

26:09.624 --> 26:11.988
And I didn't know how
you'd feel about it.

26:12.013 --> 26:14.908
Ah, Becca, if you're happy, I'm happy.

26:14.933 --> 26:17.118
That's how I feel about it.

26:17.445 --> 26:20.447
So, you were backstage when
the set fall happened?

26:20.472 --> 26:23.792
Yeah, I was trying to help Becca.
Producing something this big

26:23.817 --> 26:25.459
can be overwhelming for a seasoned pro,

26:25.484 --> 26:27.711
let alone someone doing
it the first time.

26:27.736 --> 26:31.173
But then why did you switch dance
pairs just moments before?

26:31.198 --> 26:33.121
I had to. The contestant
who was supposed

26:33.146 --> 26:35.345
to be rehearsing at that
time insisted on it.

26:35.370 --> 26:37.221
Which contestant?

26:37.489 --> 26:39.472
Steve's not the one behind the sabotage.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.995
He would never do that to me.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.884
I don't know, he's got a
lot riding on this show

26:42.909 --> 26:45.004
- being a hit.
- And it will be.

26:45.029 --> 26:47.148
He's been doing this a long time.

26:47.901 --> 26:51.069
Hey, guys, we need to
look into Selena Louise.

26:51.094 --> 26:52.551
- Selena, why?
- Five minutes before

26:52.576 --> 26:54.590
the set fell, she called me
and said it was critical

26:54.615 --> 26:56.347
she switch rehearsal times.

26:57.922 --> 26:59.906
Thanks for dragging me
out of my hotel room

26:59.931 --> 27:02.281
during the 15 minutes allotted
for sleeping on this show.

27:02.306 --> 27:04.339
It's just a quick check for
the network investigation.

27:04.364 --> 27:06.118
- We really appreciate it.
- Oh yeah, I feel

27:06.143 --> 27:07.898
nothing but appreciation as you force me

27:07.923 --> 27:09.753
to let you search my dressing room.

27:10.493 --> 27:13.341
Come on in. Don't open the box

27:13.366 --> 27:15.234
that says "Murder plan."

27:17.814 --> 27:21.349
- "Beware the bare bodkin."
- What does that mean?

27:21.999 --> 27:24.725
It means Selena's not the
one behind the sabotage.

27:25.363 --> 27:27.358
She's the target.

27:30.793 --> 27:32.924
<i>I always knew my unbridled sex appeal</i>

27:32.949 --> 27:35.565
- might get me killed one day.
- Just out

27:35.590 --> 27:37.136
of curiosity, why did you insist

27:37.161 --> 27:39.838
on switching rehearsal times
just before the set fall?

27:39.862 --> 27:42.472
Wardrobe malfunction. I
went to get it handled.

27:42.497 --> 27:45.402
A dagger in your makeup
chair is pretty specific.

27:45.427 --> 27:48.488
You're obviously being targeted,
Selena, any idea why?

27:48.597 --> 27:50.058
I'm a comic.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.551
I make fun of people for a living.

27:52.576 --> 27:54.758
Why are you asking all these questions?

27:54.783 --> 27:56.730
You're not really from
the network, are you?

27:56.755 --> 27:58.058
We're private investigators.

27:58.083 --> 27:59.917
We've been hired to look
into these attacks.

27:59.942 --> 28:01.863
And until we can figure
out who's behind them,

28:01.888 --> 28:03.558
we can't protect you.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.518
We strongly suggest that
you don't go on tomorrow.

28:06.927 --> 28:08.854
Screw that noise!

28:08.879 --> 28:12.058
I dance tomorrow, I could
win half a million bucks!

28:12.192 --> 28:13.659
That's freedom!

28:13.684 --> 28:15.995
You should take the dagger
as a very serious threat.

28:16.020 --> 28:19.592
Look, I'm not gonna let
some Casper wannabe

28:19.617 --> 28:22.218
or anyone else get in my way.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.371
That includes you.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.352
Careful! You don't want to pull a groin

28:41.387 --> 28:42.533
on game day.

28:42.860 --> 28:45.033
Couldn't make my performance any worse.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.792
You're really nervous
about this, aren't you?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.533
Well, of course I am, Dad.
I don't want to go

28:48.558 --> 28:50.955
on national TV and make
a fool out of myself.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.430
Wouldn't be the first time.

28:52.454 --> 28:55.082
- Yeah, very reassuring, thanks.
- No, no, no.

28:55.107 --> 28:57.674
I just meant that, you
know, a little bad press

28:57.699 --> 28:59.667
doesn't change who you are.

28:59.692 --> 29:01.669
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

29:01.703 --> 29:03.404
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

29:03.438 --> 29:05.539
I'm on my way to the theatre,
I'll see you later, OK?

29:05.574 --> 29:07.058
OK.

29:07.366 --> 29:09.683
Was that satin?

29:11.018 --> 29:12.986
So you have a good time with Justine?

29:13.011 --> 29:15.213
Yeah. I might do it again tonight.

29:15.238 --> 29:17.806
Really? Two nights of
study in a row, huh?

29:17.831 --> 29:19.510
That's, uh...

29:20.027 --> 29:23.012
very conscientious of you, Jules.

29:23.037 --> 29:25.271
How did you find out?

29:25.296 --> 29:27.175
From a source I trust.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.834
Dad?

29:28.859 --> 29:30.460
Liam.

29:31.911 --> 29:33.345
Yeah.

29:33.794 --> 29:36.317
Apparently, you "butt-dialed" him

29:36.342 --> 29:37.956
when you were out with your new friends.

29:37.981 --> 29:40.488
Oh, God. Um...

29:40.973 --> 29:43.511
was it... was it awful?
Is he... is he OK?

29:43.699 --> 29:45.325
I think you should
take that up with him,

29:45.350 --> 29:47.661
but I will say this:

29:47.686 --> 29:49.735
any group that requires
you to make sport

29:49.760 --> 29:52.448
of people that care about you,

29:52.912 --> 29:55.128
maybe that's a club you
don't want to join.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.878
OK.

30:06.557 --> 30:08.591
Oh, hey. How are you feeling?

30:08.616 --> 30:10.292
I can't sleep. I don't know

30:10.317 --> 30:12.230
if it's the cold medicine
or the ghost stories,

30:12.255 --> 30:14.256
but I'm starting to get
spooked over here.

30:14.281 --> 30:16.393
- [What's the latest?]
- Well, I contacted

30:16.418 --> 30:19.787
Selena's agent, her manager,
even her former writing partner,

30:19.812 --> 30:21.659
and they all said the same thing.

30:21.684 --> 30:24.073
[Selena Louise has no enemies.]

30:24.331 --> 30:27.417
Exactly. We gotta be missing something.

30:31.850 --> 30:33.042
Hello?

30:33.067 --> 30:35.488
- [Did I lose you?]
- That ghost picture you sent...

30:35.513 --> 30:37.324
[Oh yeah, sorry about that.]

30:37.349 --> 30:39.433
No, I think you might
be on to something.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.826
Really? 'Cause I was
just fooling around.

30:41.851 --> 30:43.425
As the attacks of the theatre

30:43.450 --> 30:45.620
got more personal, they leaned heavily

30:45.645 --> 30:47.785
- into the ghost myth.
- [OK.]

30:47.989 --> 30:50.557
Well, how did they know that
Selena was afraid of ghosts?

30:50.582 --> 30:53.237
Wait. I've seen her talk about this.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.542
Hold on.

30:57.298 --> 30:59.859
[Open your computer and go
to the link I sent you.]

30:59.884 --> 31:01.652
OK. Hold on.

31:02.796 --> 31:04.930
[It's a bit she does. About growing up]

31:04.955 --> 31:07.658
[in an old house as a kid and
getting scared at night.]

31:08.151 --> 31:09.577
<i>No, seriously,</i>

31:09.602 --> 31:11.904
<i>ghosts were like the
bane of my existence.</i>

31:11.970 --> 31:15.039
<i>OK? As a child, I was terrified.</i>

31:15.064 --> 31:17.299
<i>As an adult, I have questions.</i>

31:17.324 --> 31:19.883
<i>Yeah. You ever noticed
that all ghosts are men?</i>

31:19.908 --> 31:22.128
<i>Right? Like Jacob Marley,</i>

31:22.153 --> 31:25.433
<i>Beetlejuice, Patrick Swayze, Casper.</i>

31:25.458 --> 31:27.302
<i>I have a theory about this.</i>

31:27.327 --> 31:30.640
<i>It's that men won't ask directions</i>

31:30.665 --> 31:33.633
<i>to the afterlife. Like, "I know</i>

31:33.658 --> 31:35.886
<i>where I'm going."</i>

31:36.237 --> 31:38.915
<i>Come on, guys, get a GPS, buy a map!</i>

31:38.940 --> 31:40.941
<i>So are you just gonna trash
guys all night then?</i>

31:40.966 --> 31:43.081
<i>Oh! No, actually, I was planning on</i>

31:43.106 --> 31:45.237
<i>talking about my fear of ghosts, but...</i>

31:45.262 --> 31:47.532
<i>- Oh, good.
- Now that you suggested it,</i>

31:47.557 --> 31:50.339
<i>maybe I'll just focus on you.
Yeah, maybe your friends</i>

31:50.364 --> 31:52.199
<i>brought you here tonight,
so that you wouldn't die</i>

31:52.224 --> 31:55.992
<i>of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
And instead of attacking me,</i>

31:56.017 --> 31:58.485
<i>here's a suggestion: try
attacking that gut.</i>

31:58.510 --> 32:00.878
<i>Yeah, take it to the spin class.</i>

32:00.903 --> 32:04.172
<i>Dude, seriously. Speaking
of following directions,</i>

32:04.197 --> 32:07.099
<i>you should try putting some
toothpaste on that brush</i>

32:07.124 --> 32:08.636
<i>in the morn. Yeah.</i>

32:08.661 --> 32:11.136
<i>I get it though, it's hard
to get access to your mouth</i>

32:11.161 --> 32:13.462
<i>when your head is shoved
so far up your ass.</i>

32:13.486 --> 32:16.455
<i>How about you use your mouth
for something useful like...</i>

32:16.480 --> 32:19.056
<i>It's a good joke.</i>

32:19.081 --> 32:21.214
<i>So don't you have to be
funny to be a stand-up?</i>

32:21.239 --> 32:23.330
<i>- Isn't that kind of the criteria?
- Hey, pipe down, dude!</i>

32:23.355 --> 32:25.656
<i>You can. You know what I'm saying?</i>

32:25.691 --> 32:28.259
<i>Get the hell out of
here, you sexist pig!</i>

32:28.293 --> 32:31.324
OK, that was harsh,

32:31.349 --> 32:33.616
but doesn't she do that
ghost set a bunch of times?

32:33.641 --> 32:36.443
No. Actually, I read an
article that she gave it up.

32:36.468 --> 32:39.167
- That's a little weird.
- [I know, right?]

32:39.192 --> 32:41.042
Listen, uh, the show's gonna start soon,

32:41.067 --> 32:42.286
I gotta get to the theatre.

32:42.311 --> 32:43.933
[OK. I'll do some more digging.]

32:43.958 --> 32:45.792
OK.

32:46.677 --> 32:48.620
<i>Welcome to </i> Ballroom

32:48.645 --> 32:51.480
Smash!

32:54.042 --> 32:57.558
I'm your host Becca D'Orsay,
and we are broadcasting

32:57.583 --> 33:01.089
live from the Bellecroft
Theatre, in downtown Toronto.

33:01.385 --> 33:03.534
Hey, Selena, how are you holding up?

33:03.559 --> 33:06.561
I'm a comedian, I'm always
afraid of dying on stage.

33:06.586 --> 33:08.279
The decision is up to you.

33:08.304 --> 33:10.272
You're the one who looks
like you're gonna hurl.

33:10.297 --> 33:12.136
Ha! Just try to stay

33:12.161 --> 33:14.534
in sight of other people.
Don't go anywhere alone.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.788
- I told you, I'm fine.
- Places, people!

33:17.879 --> 33:19.308
Places!

33:19.342 --> 33:21.660
- Raven?
- Ready.

33:27.765 --> 33:29.214
Hey, Zoe, what's up?

33:29.239 --> 33:31.158
[I found the uncensored
version of the video.]

33:31.184 --> 33:33.470
You do not want to know
what that guy said.

33:33.495 --> 33:35.042
I'll take your word for it.

33:35.067 --> 33:36.932
[Point is the video went viral.]

33:36.957 --> 33:40.113
- [It got over 60 million views.]
- 60 million?

33:40.138 --> 33:43.341
And the comments were brutal.
People tore that guy apart.

33:43.366 --> 33:46.101
- Did you figure out who it was?
- [Didn't have to.]

33:46.126 --> 33:48.628
The crowd did it for me.
Someone found a link

33:48.653 --> 33:50.421
to his Ameechee page and posted it,

33:50.446 --> 33:52.284
and everyone started flaming him.

33:52.309 --> 33:54.767
They got him fired from his job.
He lost his fiancée.

33:54.792 --> 33:57.315
He basically had to change
his name and run away.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.884
I sent you the link.

33:58.909 --> 34:01.748
OK. Hold on, I'm just
pulling up to the theatre.

34:02.036 --> 34:03.750
One second.

34:06.185 --> 34:08.420
Oh, my God! It's him!

34:08.446 --> 34:10.761
- Him who?
- It's Sami, the editor

34:10.786 --> 34:13.385
from the show. I've got to go, Zoe.

34:18.302 --> 34:21.496
Come on, Shade, pick up.

34:21.521 --> 34:24.355
Comedian extraordinaire Selena Louise...

- You need to stop the show.

35:28.974 --> 35:30.923
Are you out of your mind? We're live!

35:30.948 --> 35:33.301
- Where's Sami, the editor?
- Sami Chapman?

35:33.326 --> 35:35.239
He's not part of our live broadcast.

35:35.264 --> 35:36.761
He's part of Becca's morning show...

35:37.067 --> 35:39.044
- Wait, what do you know?
- Nothing for sure,

35:39.069 --> 35:41.856
but if he's here, Selena
could be in a lot of danger.

Wasn't that incredible? Let's give it up

35:57.722 --> 35:59.532
for our brilliant dancers!

35:59.557 --> 36:02.421
- I'm your host Becca D'Orsay.
- Hey, what's that earpiece for?

36:02.446 --> 36:04.264
It's for streaming the
music, so they can hear it

36:04.289 --> 36:06.983
- over the crowd.
- Can you put me in his ear?

36:07.008 --> 36:09.225
Tonight, one of these four contestants

36:09.250 --> 36:11.510
will be crowned the Queen
or King of the ball.

36:11.535 --> 36:12.889
Hey, Shade, it's me.
I'm in the building.

36:12.914 --> 36:15.163
Listen, the guy that we're looking for

36:15.188 --> 36:16.841
is named Sami. He's an editor.

36:16.866 --> 36:18.867
He's got red, curly hair and a beard.

36:19.056 --> 36:21.757
I'm gonna keep searching for him,
but you need to stay with Selena

36:21.782 --> 36:24.327
at all costs. I'm
convinced he's gonna try

36:24.352 --> 36:26.397
and kill her. She ruined his life.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.479
Or former ice hockey champ

36:29.504 --> 36:32.311
Matt Shade!

36:32.625 --> 36:34.359
Thanks.

36:34.906 --> 36:37.269
Yo.

36:37.294 --> 36:39.062
[Hey, Zoe. It's me again.]

36:39.087 --> 36:41.021
How did Grover Newell kill himself?

36:41.046 --> 36:42.383
Hmm...

36:42.408 --> 36:44.397
[Hold on a sec.]

36:44.422 --> 36:47.824
Wait, he hung himself in
the centre of the theatre.

36:48.321 --> 36:50.542
Rafters, that's where
we need to be looking.

36:50.645 --> 36:52.991
- Great, thanks.
- [Wait, wait, no.]

36:53.016 --> 36:56.352
He hung a rope over a fly bar
and then released the trapdoor

36:56.377 --> 36:57.967
You know her

36:57.992 --> 36:59.921
as the queen of <i>Rugged Landscapes,</i>

36:59.946 --> 37:02.537
but can she become the
queen of the ball?

37:02.562 --> 37:05.084
Let's have a huge hand
from Veronica Valor

37:05.108 --> 37:09.144
and her partner, Neil!

37:21.582 --> 37:23.285
Becca...

37:23.640 --> 37:26.077
you're not gonna like this, but, uh...

37:26.245 --> 37:28.748
we need to make a change to the program.

37:41.198 --> 37:44.662
Wow!

37:54.056 --> 37:57.233
OK! Let's keep this party going.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.976
Our next contestant is one
seriously funny dame.

38:01.001 --> 38:04.183
Let's give it up for
comic Selena Louise!

38:08.797 --> 38:11.027
Oh, God! Let this be good.

38:11.176 --> 38:15.126
<i>And in a surprise twist
that no one told you about,</i>

38:15.273 --> 38:18.209
she will be performing the paso doble

38:18.234 --> 38:19.754
with hockey legend

38:19.779 --> 38:23.512
Matt Shade!

38:24.209 --> 38:26.832
- What is she doing?
- Shade, what the hell?!

38:26.857 --> 38:29.183
You gotta trust me. Not sure
how, but your life's in danger.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.777
- I didn't learn the paso doble.
- It's alright,

38:31.802 --> 38:35.689
just follow my lead. We'll
be fine, I promise.

38:40.459 --> 38:42.530
Oh, my God!

39:03.694 --> 39:05.832
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- No worry,

39:05.857 --> 39:08.668
it's just like a bullfight. I'm
the matador, you're the bull.

39:08.693 --> 39:11.266
What?! Why do I have to be the bull?!

39:19.417 --> 39:20.644
Doing great.

39:20.669 --> 39:22.096
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:22.129 --> 39:23.305
- Duck.
- What?

39:23.330 --> 39:25.496
- Duck!
- Ooh!

39:27.438 --> 39:29.909
- Don't step on my ankles.
- Sorry.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.304
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey!

39:36.367 --> 39:38.135
What the hell do you think you're doing?

39:38.160 --> 39:40.276
He's in danger, I need to warn him.

39:40.791 --> 39:42.496
There!

39:42.521 --> 39:45.136
- He's gonna blow the trapdoor.
- Who?

39:45.987 --> 39:48.722
Now, we have to do the Widow's Leap.
I'm gonna go stand over there,

39:48.747 --> 39:50.128
- you're gonna jump on me.
- Don't think it's a good idea.

39:50.153 --> 39:51.558
We're gonna do it.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.714
- Oh, shit!
- The earpiece.

39:53.739 --> 39:55.527
Wait.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.136
Shade,

39:57.161 --> 39:58.964
[there's a trapdoor, get off there.]

40:19.913 --> 40:24.590
Whoo!

40:28.340 --> 40:31.138
I tried. I tried to
put it all behind me,

40:31.163 --> 40:33.389
start a new life, then
she just showed up.

40:33.603 --> 40:36.756
Everyone was gonna find out. I
couldn't let her destroy me again.

40:36.781 --> 40:39.313
You did this to yourself.
Get him out of here.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.355
No! No!

40:41.650 --> 40:45.245
Ah.

40:52.066 --> 40:54.969
<i>So I met a local DJ here in town,</i>

40:54.994 --> 40:56.792
and she invited me out
with some of her friends

40:56.817 --> 40:58.611
to an underground music show.

40:58.636 --> 41:01.304
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I don't know.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.312
I guess I just wanted
to do it on my own.

41:03.337 --> 41:04.840
In Italy,

41:04.865 --> 41:08.133
we spent every minute
together, which was great,

41:08.158 --> 41:10.893
- but...
- But now we're back.

41:10.918 --> 41:12.801
I feel like we're gonna
burn out on each other

41:12.826 --> 41:14.566
if we don't do our own things sometimes.

41:14.591 --> 41:16.459
You know, you could
have just told me that.

41:16.484 --> 41:19.230
I know. It was stupid of me, I'm sorry.

41:19.331 --> 41:22.231
- How was the music?
- It was amazing!

41:22.781 --> 41:25.025
And they invited me to go again tonight.

41:25.795 --> 41:28.897

conversation over there, Dad.

41:43.708 --> 41:46.447
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

41:46.628 --> 41:50.050
I think Jules is old enough to
have her own life now, Matt,

41:50.288 --> 41:52.923

42:05.823 --> 42:08.371
No, not lately, so please do go on.

42:08.396 --> 42:11.565
<i>Ballroom Smash</i> was a huge success.
Numbers through the roof.

42:11.590 --> 42:13.721
We've already got approval
for a follow-up special.

42:13.745 --> 42:17.157
- Congratulations, that's great news.
- It's great for you too.

42:17.182 --> 42:19.205
Steve wants to have you back
as a contestant to defend

42:19.230 --> 42:21.465
the title that was stolen from you.

42:21.746 --> 42:23.714
Sorry I could not award you
the prize money, Shadow.

42:23.739 --> 42:25.354
You broke the rules when
you switched partners,

42:25.379 --> 42:27.947
so you're disqualified,
even though, in my opinion,

42:27.972 --> 42:32.010
- you were the best.
- Yeah, um, that's totally fine.

42:32.035 --> 42:34.218
Veronica deserved it just as much.

42:34.243 --> 42:37.222
And it's a great win for the
ugly animals of the world.

42:37.917 --> 42:40.519
- How's Sami?
- He's being charged.

42:40.544 --> 42:42.385
But the network is going
to make sure that he gets

42:42.410 --> 42:44.635
the help he needs. Shadow,

42:44.660 --> 42:46.878
thank you so much. You really went

42:46.903 --> 42:50.135
- above and beyond this time.
- Anytime, Becca.

42:53.842 --> 42:56.417
- So...?
- So what?

42:56.442 --> 42:58.577
You never did tell me what you
thought of my performance.

42:58.602 --> 43:00.682
Oh, you don't need to
know what I thought.

43:00.707 --> 43:02.065
I crushed it, didn't I?

43:02.090 --> 43:04.808
Wow, nothing's sexier
than a man gloating.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.500
- Oh, come on!
- I didn't really see it

43:06.525 --> 43:09.694
to tell you the truth. See,
first, I was under the stage,

43:09.719 --> 43:12.377
and then I was just so
focused on you not dying.

43:12.402 --> 43:14.801
You're really not gonna
tell me, are you?

43:14.891 --> 43:16.892
Alright. All I can say is

43:16.917 --> 43:19.803
for five minutes, I made
everyone in this theatre

43:19.828 --> 43:21.863
forget the name Grover Newell.

43:24.400 --> 43:28.229
We should probably keep moving. Agreed.
