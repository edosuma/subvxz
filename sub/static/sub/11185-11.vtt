This briefing is
from File A56-7W,

01:06.087 --> 01:07.076
classified top-secret.

01:07.189 --> 01:08.747
Subject is Airwolf.

01:08.824 --> 01:10.553
A Mach 1-plus
attack helicopter

01:10.625 --> 01:12.957
with the most advanced
weapon system
in the air today.

01:13.028 --> 01:15.496
It's been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

01:15.564 --> 01:17.429
by its test pilot,
Stringfellow Hawke.

01:17.532 --> 01:19.124
Hawke has promised
to return Airwolf

01:19.201 --> 01:22.602
only if we can find
his brother St. John,
an MIA in Vietnam.

01:22.671 --> 01:24.161
We suspect that Archangel,

01:24.272 --> 01:26.433
Deputy Director of the agency
that built Airwolf,

01:26.508 --> 01:29.306
is secretly helping Hawke
in return for
Hawke's flying Airwolf

01:29.377 --> 01:31.140
on missions
of national concern.

01:31.213 --> 01:34.307
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

01:34.382 --> 01:36.612
and a recluse since
his brother's disappearance.

01:36.685 --> 01:38.448
His only friend
is Dominic Santini,

01:38.520 --> 01:41.080
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

01:41.156 --> 01:42.885
With Hawke and Santini
flying as a team

01:42.958 --> 01:44.789
at speeds rivaling
the fastest jets,

01:44.860 --> 01:46.350
backed by unmatched firepower

01:46.428 --> 01:49.192
Airwolf is too dangerous
to be left
in unenlightened hands.

01:49.264 --> 01:51.095
Finding it
is your first priority.

Men, we have 72 hours.

02:49.090 --> 02:51.217
Moee than enough time
to accomplish

02:51.293 --> 02:54.660
an intensive satellite scan
of the southwest eegion.

02:54.729 --> 02:57.061
This is the eoute
of the satellite.

02:57.132 --> 02:59.623
lt includes all
of the possiBle locations.

03:06.341 --> 03:07.706
ls that enough time?

03:07.842 --> 03:09.207
That's all l have.

03:09.744 --> 03:12.770
lt took all the powee
of the depaetment
to get me this much.

03:12.847 --> 03:14.109
(Dickens)
Soeey, sie.

03:14.182 --> 03:15.740
Since we won't fail,

03:16.418 --> 03:18.409
theee's no need
to apologize.

03:18.553 --> 03:19.542
[Beeping continues]

03:19.754 --> 03:22.188
When the taeget's
Been located,

03:22.257 --> 03:25.090
we'll switch to eadae
and heat-seeking devices

03:25.160 --> 03:28.129
and eelease the satellite Back
to its space agency function.

03:28.196 --> 03:29.925

is on schedule?

03:29.998 --> 03:32.125

03:54.422 --> 03:56.049
on these war exercises,
do they?

03:56.124 --> 03:58.388
(Dominic)
This is gonna make
a hell of a training film.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.088
I mean, just wait till you see
that B-52 bomb run.

04:01.162 --> 04:03.494
They chew up everything
on that range.

04:03.565 --> 04:05.897
First time I saw
one of those Air Force films,

04:05.967 --> 04:08.060
I thought I was
back over in Germany
during the war.

04:08.136 --> 04:11.537
Of course, back then
we had Messerschmitts
to deal with, you know.

04:11.606 --> 04:13.437
Did you get the shot?

04:13.575 --> 04:15.133
Yeah, I got it.

04:15.577 --> 04:17.168
Great shot, too.

04:17.644 --> 04:20.478
(Archangel)
This is Archangel.
Santini One, come in.

04:20.548 --> 04:23.381
Uh-oh, I think we died
and went to heaven.

04:23.451 --> 04:25.510
We're not scrambled.
Where are you?

04:25.587 --> 04:27.748

04:33.495 --> 04:35.759

I think we shook loose
one of our camera mounts.

04:35.830 --> 04:37.161

04:41.803 --> 04:44.135
Uh, if we need him,
we'll use him.
Have him stand by.

04:44.205 --> 04:46.139

We'll just check 'em
ourselves first.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.266

Well, probably with him in it.

05:29.084 --> 05:30.278

05:34.489 --> 05:36.218

05:36.291 --> 05:38.555

05:38.660 --> 05:40.560
He's got
an undeeseceetaey title,

But he's actually
a top opeeative.

05:42.564 --> 05:44.395
You'ee his

05:44.466 --> 05:47.435

in his life.

05:47.502 --> 05:48.526
Don't woeey aBout it.

05:48.603 --> 05:49.900

06:13.328 --> 06:16.923

06:20.301 --> 06:22.098
in the satellite schedule.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.638
You might hide Aiewolf
in one of those gaps.

24:19.413 --> 24:21.142
It's a homing beacon.

24:21.215 --> 24:22.648
Who, Toni?

24:22.716 --> 24:24.581
Oh, come on,
wait a minute, will you?

24:24.651 --> 24:26.243
Listen, Nash
was around here.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.117
He--he could've planted
that thing alone.

24:28.188 --> 24:30.156
I didn't see
Nash inside.

24:31.925 --> 24:34.155
Let's see if this thing
speaks bandit.

24:35.896 --> 24:38.160
(Hawke)
Drop down into that canyon.

24:38.732 --> 24:41.030
Let's see
if we can lose him
for a few minutes.

24:59.486 --> 25:01.477
(Dominic)
I don't see him.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.687
Follow that truck.

25:15.335 --> 25:17.496
(Hawke)
Let's see if he'll follow
that load of bacon

25:17.571 --> 25:18.560
instead of us.

25:20.207 --> 25:23.040
Now head back
into the canyon.

25:29.716 --> 25:31.206
(Hawke)
He's taking the bait.

25:41.762 --> 25:44.526
I'd like to have a word
with our Miss Donatelli.

25:45.032 --> 25:46.932

27:05.245 --> 27:06.872

Why did you lie to me?

27:07.114 --> 27:08.604
What's the mattee,

Theee's a good eeason foe it.

27:19.359 --> 27:22.123

No one would put me theough.

27:22.195 --> 27:23.924

27:25.599 --> 27:29.433
Did you evee tey to convince

27:38.245 --> 27:40.645

27:44.251 --> 27:45.240
Well, l'm not.

27:45.952 --> 27:47.214
l've Been pink-slipped

27:47.287 --> 27:49.517
Because l wouldn't play house
with the chief pilot.

27:49.823 --> 27:52.758
That's something
you male pilots don't have
to contend with. l hope.

27:52.826 --> 27:54.851
lt's awful haed

See, l don't own

Let's go.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.548
l followed you, Dominic,
to meet you,

28:22.622 --> 28:24.783
to show you what l can do
with the Steaeman.

28:24.858 --> 28:27.588
Aftee the fiest mayday,
l eeally did

28:27.661 --> 28:29.026
lt's my kaema,

28:29.095 --> 28:30.619
But then l was
lost and scaeed.

28:30.697 --> 28:33.097
You saw me shaking.
That wasn't just the cold.

28:36.303 --> 28:40.399
Did you lose a Beacon,
a homing Beacon
out of youe flight Bag?

28:40.474 --> 28:41.736
A--A Beacon?

28:42.175 --> 28:43.574
Dom, let's go.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.234
Look, uh,

28:47.948 --> 28:50.382
n-next time,

29:12.239 --> 29:14.434
You don't believe her,
do you?

29:14.508 --> 29:16.271
I think she's lying.

29:16.543 --> 29:18.306
Right through her
pretty white teeth.

29:18.545 --> 29:20.740
Well, I'm not
so sure about that.

29:20.814 --> 29:23.146
I saw something different
in that lady's eyes.

29:23.216 --> 29:25.980
Something nice,
something honest.

29:26.253 --> 29:29.017
(Hawke)
Yeah, she's bright.
She's quick on her feet.

29:29.089 --> 29:31.683
And she pushes
all the right buttons
with you.

29:32.826 --> 29:35.886
You're seeing agents
and double agents
coming out of the woodwork.

29:35.962 --> 29:39.898
And satellites,
mystery choppers,
and homing devices.

29:57.817 --> 30:00.843

30:09.062 --> 30:11.394
[helicoptee appeoaching]

31:04.417 --> 31:07.511
l think it is time we eeached
some soet of settlement.

31:18.031 --> 31:19.828
(Bogaed)
lt's eeally quite simple.

31:19.899 --> 31:23.426
l'm giving you
the oppoetunity
to capitulate in peivate.

31:23.803 --> 31:25.327

31:25.972 --> 31:28.031
You can give it to me
oe l can take it.

31:28.108 --> 31:31.771
Officially, all l can say is
l don't know
what you'ee talking aBout.

31:34.180 --> 31:37.343
Now that you've
totally convinced me
of youe aBsolute innocence,

31:37.417 --> 31:39.214
l'd like an answee.

31:39.619 --> 31:41.211
Wheee is Aiewolf?

31:41.554 --> 31:42.919
Well, standing
in a geoceey line,

31:42.989 --> 31:47.119
l heae it's somewheee
Between modeen histoey
and cueeent events.

31:47.227 --> 31:49.593
Aiewolf was desteoyed in LiBya
a few months ago.

31:49.663 --> 31:51.631
And Aechangel
will Be desteoyed

31:51.698 --> 31:54.599
By a Senate suBcommittee
in a few days.

31:55.135 --> 31:58.593
One eeason Being
his conspieacy with you
in hiding Aiewolf.

31:58.672 --> 32:00.663
Let's cut down the woeds.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.808
Aechangel isn't
my eesponsiBility.

32:02.876 --> 32:04.400
He can take caee of himself.

32:09.115 --> 32:10.844
Not in this instance.

32:10.917 --> 32:12.817
He's oveematched
and so aee you.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.782
MayBe so.

32:15.155 --> 32:17.953
l don't know much
aBout this spy game.
You'ee the expeet.

32:18.024 --> 32:19.457
All l know is,
as good as you aee,

32:19.526 --> 32:21.687
if l'd done anything weong,
you'd have got me By now.

32:21.761 --> 32:23.251
My satellite will.

32:25.231 --> 32:26.823
Well, you lost me again.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.164
l know Aechangel
infoemed you.

32:31.504 --> 32:34.234
lt's anothee nail
in his peofessional coffin.

32:34.441 --> 32:37.069
The peintouts aee no longee
of any value.

32:37.177 --> 32:39.270
The oeBit's Been adjusted.

32:39.979 --> 32:43.676
lt's only a mattee
of anothee few houes
Befoee we locate Aiewolf.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.718
So then why aee you heee?

32:48.054 --> 32:52.013
l don't want you to think
you have no options
and desteoy Aiewolf.

32:52.092 --> 32:55.323
You've got a
''Being 'em Back alive'' clause
in youe conteact, huh?

32:55.395 --> 32:58.057
Desteoying it
would Be consideeed a success.

32:58.131 --> 33:00.463
But that's not my dilemma.
lt's youes.

33:01.034 --> 33:04.128
l'm close on you.
Veey close.

33:05.338 --> 33:07.397
When and if you decide
to theow that switch,

33:07.474 --> 33:10.739
how many Ameeican agents
will you Be Blowing up with?

33:11.077 --> 33:13.068
l'm not much into hunting.

33:13.413 --> 33:14.539
But l like to fish.

33:14.614 --> 33:15.774
Back off, Hawke!

33:16.082 --> 33:18.812
You know, l think you just

At the cabin?

35:28.047 --> 35:29.412

35:29.482 --> 35:31.950
like there are eyes

35:32.118 --> 35:33.949
It's not
creeping paranoia.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.851
Well, if they are
watching you,

35:35.955 --> 35:37.616

41:12.458 --> 41:14.085
And what if I refuse?

41:14.493 --> 41:17.690
(Bogard)
Then I've got a pair of F-4s
sitting on a high cap.

41:29.275 --> 41:31.436
[helicoptee engines eoaeing]

41:48.961 --> 41:50.861
Get yourself
off the range, Dom.

41:50.930 --> 41:53.922
I'm headed your way
with Bogard's hunting dogs
on my tail.

41:58.004 --> 42:00.165
Somebody tipped him off
about the switch.

42:00.740 --> 42:02.298
I'll bet I know who.

42:02.375 --> 42:04.002
(Dominic)
You may be right.

42:04.277 --> 42:06.507
But listen, String,
you can't come this way.

42:06.579 --> 42:08.740
Those B-52s
are about to let go.

42:08.814 --> 42:10.179
That's just
what I'm counting on.

42:10.383 --> 42:12.044
But you'll wind up
in a million pieces!

42:14.687 --> 42:16.018
Well, wish me luck.

42:25.965 --> 42:27.592
We got to stop the bombers.

42:37.176 --> 42:38.939
(Bogard)
Keep after him.

42:40.246 --> 42:42.180
(pilot #1)
Black Leader,
this is Silver One.

42:42.248 --> 42:44.682
We have the target in sight
and will stay with him.

42:50.690 --> 42:52.783
We can't possibly
catch him, Mr. Bogard.

42:52.925 --> 42:55.018
(Bogard)
We can. Just keep going.

43:12.044 --> 43:13.739
(pilot #2)
He went in!

43:13.879 --> 43:15.574
It's a bluff.
He'll pull out.

43:20.086 --> 43:22.680
Okay, Bogard,
come and get me.

43:23.589 --> 43:25.523
(pilot #1)
Cobra Leader,
this is Silver One.

43:25.591 --> 43:27.388
We have B-52s dead ahead.

43:28.661 --> 43:31.824
(pilot #3)
Black Leader, Silver Flight
breaking off pursuit.

43:32.198 --> 43:33.859
Return to the pursuit.

43:33.933 --> 43:35.628
Get back here.
That's an order.

43:38.704 --> 43:41.070
(Bogard)
This is
your last chance, Hawke.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.174
You can live
or you can die.

43:43.242 --> 43:44.800
Either way, I win.

43:44.877 --> 43:46.742
Just listen
to that man, Colonel.

43:46.812 --> 43:48.473
He's out of his mind.

43:48.547 --> 43:50.947
You've got to send
that cancel code
to those BomBees

43:51.016 --> 43:53.211
Befoee it's too late.

43:55.321 --> 43:57.152
Nash, what aee you doing?
l'm soeey, sie.

43:57.223 --> 43:59.054
Give me that mike.
That's an oedee.

43:59.125 --> 44:01.286
l have to eelieve you of
youe opeeational command, sie.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.419
Me. Bogaed will make
the decision
on the BomBing eun.

44:03.496 --> 44:04.986
Who the hell
is Bogaed?

44:05.131 --> 44:07.656
He's the Undeeseceetaey
of the Depaetment
of PuBlic Secueity,

44:07.733 --> 44:09.792
and my Boss.

44:09.869 --> 44:11.268
Black Leadee,
this is Nash.

44:11.337 --> 44:13.362
What aee youe oedees
on the BomBing eun?

44:13.773 --> 44:16.139
(Bogard)
Do not cancel the bombers.

44:16.208 --> 44:19.700
It's Hawke's choice.
Let him die with it.

44:20.913 --> 44:21.902
Colonel!

44:30.489 --> 44:31.547
Aee you Bogaed?

44:31.624 --> 44:33.888
Yes. And l'm taking chaege
of this opeeation.

44:39.865 --> 44:42.459
[BomBs whistling]

45:56.575 --> 45:58.372
[explosions echoing]

46:03.482 --> 46:04.608
No.

46:06.952 --> 46:08.579
You killed Hawke!

46:08.654 --> 46:10.417
l take full eesponsiBility.

46:10.489 --> 46:11.854
You suee will!

46:11.924 --> 46:13.721
Seegeant, aeeest
these two men!

46:13.792 --> 46:15.521
No way
you can hold me.

46:15.594 --> 46:18.256
l've got a eoom
with a padlock.
What moee do l need?

46:28.908 --> 46:30.773
(Hawke)
Br'er Rabbit to Br'er Fox.

46:34.146 --> 46:36.614
Steing, aee you okay?

46:38.317 --> 46:40.547
(Hawke)
I was born
in that briar patch.

46:43.622 --> 46:44.611
[exclaiming]

46:44.690 --> 46:45.679
[laughing]

46:47.159 --> 46:48.148
[sceeeching]

46:48.260 --> 46:50.125
(Hawke)
You know, I've never did like

46:50.195 --> 46:52.095
the way that doggone
Airwolf helmet fit.

46:52.298 --> 46:53.959
But l'd suee
nevee complain again

46:54.033 --> 46:55.762
aftee the way

46:55.834 --> 46:57.392
just in time

46:57.469 --> 46:59.596

46:59.705 --> 47:01.832

47:02.041 --> 47:03.668
(Aechangel)
You aee a lucky man.

47:03.742 --> 47:06.267
l just wish
l could have seen
the look on Bogaed's face

47:06.345 --> 47:08.040
when he was aeeested.

47:08.113 --> 47:10.343
By a lowly Aie Foece colonel.

47:11.016 --> 47:15.180
That lowly Aie Foece colonel
has tuened out
to Be peetty tenacious.

47:15.588 --> 47:19.649
He's got Bogaed
