WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.000
Joey: ONCE UPON A TIME

00:04.000 --> 00:06.500
IN A GALAXY NOT ENTIRELY
UNLIKE OUR OWN,

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
THERE WAS A GIRL.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.625
THERE WAS
NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.333
SHE WAS
BY HER OWN ESTIMATION

00:12.333 --> 00:14.333
A RELATIVELY SIMPLE SORT,

00:14.333 --> 00:16.667
YET SHE WAS CURSED.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.125
FOR AS LONG
AS SHE COULD REMEMBER,

00:18.125 --> 00:20.959
HER ROMANTIC LIFE HAD BEEN
SOMETHING OF A DISASTER.

00:20.959 --> 00:24.667
BOYS EITHER FELL TOO HARD,
TOO FAST, OR NOT AT ALL.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.000
SHE HAD LONG SINCE
GIVEN UP ON THE NOTION

00:27.000 --> 00:28.792
OF A FUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP,

00:28.792 --> 00:31.667
WHICH IS WHY, IN THE WINTER
OF HER 19th YEAR,

00:31.667 --> 00:33.041
SHE WAS SURPRISED
TO FIND HERSELF

00:33.041 --> 00:34.125
IN THE COMPANY OF A BOY

00:34.125 --> 00:39.041
WHO MADE HER FEEL AS IF
THE CURSE HAD BEEN LIFTED...

00:39.041 --> 00:44.333
IF ONLY TEMPORARILY.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.834
HEH HEH HEH!

00:46.834 --> 00:49.166
SO...CHOCOLATE
OR VANILLA?

00:49.166 --> 00:50.208
CHOCOLATE.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.208
CAKE OR PIE?
PIE.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.875
COKE OR PEPSI?
COKE.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.708
CHRISTMAS
OR HALLOWEEN?
HALLOWEEN.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.417
THAT SETTLES IT.
WE HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.083
WELL, THE SEX IS GOOD.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.875
PLEASE,
I HAD BETTER SEX
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.625
OK. ARE WE DONE WITH
THIS MONTH'S COSMO
COMPATIBILITY TEST?

01:06.625 --> 01:08.875
CAN WE JUST GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES?

01:08.875 --> 01:12.000
MMM! NOT SO FAST.
I HAVE ONE MORE
QUESTION.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.542
OK, SHOOT.

01:13.542 --> 01:16.041
CHRISTMAS IN BOSTON
IN YOUR SQUALID
LITTLE APARTMENT

01:16.041 --> 01:18.458
OR CHRISTMAS
IN CAPESIDE
WITH YOURS TRULY?

01:20.083 --> 01:22.583
HEH HEH.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.417
I JUST SAID THAT
OUT LOUD, DIDN'T I?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.917
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

01:24.917 --> 01:28.250
WOW. I JUST CROSSED
A LINE INTO THAT WORLD

01:28.250 --> 01:29.959
WHERE GIRLS PRESSURE
THEIR BOYFRIENDS

01:29.959 --> 01:32.083
INTO DOING STUFF
WITH THEM, AND THEN--

01:32.083 --> 01:33.291
I JUST REFERRED TO YOU
AS MY BOYFRIEND.

01:33.291 --> 01:35.792
I'M A MESS. I APOLOGIZE.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.417
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

01:38.417 --> 01:39.750
YOU KNOW...

01:42.417 --> 01:44.542
ACTUALLY...

01:44.542 --> 01:45.792
EDDIE, I TAKE THAT BACK.

01:45.792 --> 01:46.834
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.041
I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME CONVINCE
MY RETARDED SISTER

01:49.041 --> 01:50.291
THAT WE SHOULD
BUCK TRADITION

01:50.291 --> 01:53.542
AND THROW OUT OUR STUPID
FAKE CHRISTMAS TREE

01:53.542 --> 01:55.417
AND GET A REAL ONE
FOR A CHANGE.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.542
IS--IS THAT WRONG?

01:57.542 --> 02:00.875
OK. FIRST OF ALL,
I HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILY ALL MY OWN,

02:00.875 --> 02:03.917
SO I WON'T BE CELEBRATING
WITH A TV DINNER
UNDER A BARE BULB,

02:03.917 --> 02:05.583
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.500
AND SECOND--

02:07.500 --> 02:10.583
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA
AT THIS JUNCTURE.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.959
WHAT JUNCTURE IS THAT?

02:12.959 --> 02:15.834
WELL, THE JUNCTURE
OF TOO MUCH AND TOO SOON.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.291
WE'RE EVEN, THEN.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.625
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:21.625 --> 02:24.250
(GIGGLES) IT MEANS
THAT CLEARLY

02:24.250 --> 02:26.625
I'M A TYPICAL GIRL
AND, BASED ON
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

02:26.625 --> 02:28.250
YOU'RE VERY MUCH
A TYPICAL GUY.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.625
HEY, YOU KNOW,
MEETING THE FAMILY'S
A HUGE DEAL,

02:30.625 --> 02:31.834
ESPECIALLY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.625
I MEAN, I'D PROBABLY
HAVE TO PUT ON
SOME KIND OF A SWEATER.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.625
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A HOLIDAY SWEATER.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.250
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I HATE SWEATERS.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.125
I LOOK STUPID
IN SWEATERS.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.250
I BET YOU LOOK
VERY NICE IN SWEATERS.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.834
ALL RIGHT, PENCIL ME
FOR PRESIDENT'S WEEKEND.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.417
I'LL BE THERE.
I PROMISE.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.542
FINE.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.834
BUT DON'T THINK WE'RE
EVER HAVING SEX AGAIN.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.500
HEH HEH HEH!

02:52.500 --> 02:53.375
WHAT?

02:53.375 --> 02:55.625
WHAT A TYPICAL GIRL,
USING SEX AS A WEAPON.

02:57.166 --> 02:59.500
SHUT UP.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.000
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
HAVE I TOLD YOU THAT?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.417
SUCKING UP
WILL GET YOU NOWHERE.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.542
ALLOW ME TO COUNT THE WAYS
IN WHICH I SUCK.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.041
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:06.041 --> 04:07.041
I MISSED MY FLIGHT,

04:07.041 --> 04:08.375
WHICH, TO THE BEST
OF MY KNOWLEDGE,

04:08.375 --> 04:09.667
ONLY HAPPENS
IN THE MOVIES,

04:09.667 --> 04:11.041
BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.083
APPARENTLY, IT CAN HAPPEN
IN REAL LIFE, TOO,

04:13.083 --> 04:15.417
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
IN THE AIRPORT BAR

04:15.417 --> 04:17.416
LETTING CREEPY
WILLY LOMAN TYPES

04:17.416 --> 04:19.583
BUY YOU DRINKS.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.916
ISN'T IT A LITTLE EARLY TO BE
KNOCKING 'EM BACK, AUDREY?

04:21.916 --> 04:23.417
EVEN FOR YOU?

04:23.417 --> 04:25.208
DRINKING DOESN'T COUNT
ON DAYS WHEN YOU FLY.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.000
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
HAVE TO GET SAUCED

04:26.000 --> 04:27.959
TO FLY THE FRIENDLY
SKIES, YOU KNOW.

04:27.959 --> 04:28.959
IT HELPS KEEP THE VOICES
DOWN IN MY HEAD

04:28.959 --> 04:30.250
THAT TELL ME
I'M SECONDS AWAY

04:30.250 --> 04:31.750
FROM PLUMMETING
TO MY DEATH.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.041
I DON'T KNOW, AUDREY.
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.917
YOU MIGHT BE SPENDING
THE NEXT SEMESTER IN REHAB.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.792
NO, REHAB, REHAB IS
FOR QUITTERS.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.792
OK, SO WHAT'S
THE PLAN?

04:41.792 --> 04:43.583
WELL, I COULDN'T GET ANOTHER
FLIGHT OUT UNTIL TOMORROW.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.583
CHRISTMAS ON A PLANE.
WHOO, MAMA.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.625
SO WHY DON'T YOU
COME HOME WITH ME?

04:47.625 --> 04:50.583
NO. REALLY, I CAN'T.
I'LL BE FINE.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.583
AUDREY,
I'M NOT LETTING YOU

04:51.583 --> 04:52.667
SPEND THE MAJORITY
OF CHRISTMAS DAY

04:52.667 --> 04:53.583
DRUNK ON AN AIRPLANE

04:53.583 --> 04:55.834
WITH A MOTLEY ASSORTMENT
OF SAD TRAVELERS.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.792
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
IT SOUNDS WAY BETTER

04:57.792 --> 04:59.125
THAN INTRUDING ON
SOMEONE ELSE'S HOLIDAY.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.458
LOOK, YOU WOULDN'T
BE INTRUDING

05:00.458 --> 05:02.458
ON ANYONE'S HOLIDAY.
TRUST ME.

05:02.458 --> 05:03.583
DAWSON'S MOM IS INVITING

05:03.583 --> 05:04.834
EVERYONE
TO CHRISTMAS DINNER,

05:04.834 --> 05:08.625
WHICH...SOUNDS LIKE
A RECIPE FOR DISASTER,

05:08.625 --> 05:10.917
BUT AT LEAST
WE'LL ALL BE TOGETHER.

05:10.917 --> 05:11.625
I DON'T KNOW, JOEY.

05:11.625 --> 05:12.458
OK, IT SEEMS LIKE
THE ONLY THING

05:12.458 --> 05:14.291
THAT I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
THIS SEMESTER

05:14.291 --> 05:15.792
IS ALIENATING EVERYONE.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.291
YOU KNOW, AND NOW,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

05:17.291 --> 05:19.792
I'M YOUR FRIGGIN'
CHRISTMAS CHARITY CASE.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.625
AND LET'S NOT
FORGET THE FACT

05:21.625 --> 05:22.542
THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE
THE CAPESIDE THING,

05:22.542 --> 05:24.959
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
IT WAS A STULTIFYING BORE.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.583
WELL, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR ON THAT ONE,

05:30.583 --> 05:32.458
BUT YOU'RE
STILL COMING WITH ME.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.208
I DON'T KNOW.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.834
MY FATHER'S
GONNA BE THERE.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.166
CAN I ASK HIM
ABOUT PRISON?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.625
IF YOU WANT.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.333
ALL RIGHT,
YOU TALKED ME INTO IT.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.708
IT'LL BE FUN, I PROMISE.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.000
ALL RIGHT.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.333
BETTER BE.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.875
I'LL BE BACK.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.291
PACEY, IS THAT YOU?

06:09.291 --> 06:10.708
MERRY CHRISTMAS, DOUGIE.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.000
YEAH,
RIGHT BACK AT YA.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.834
NOW, IF YOU WOULDN'T
MIND, COULD YOU TELL ME

06:14.834 --> 06:16.500
WHAT YOU DID
WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.000
I MURDERED THAT PUNK.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.708
STUFFED HIS BODY
INTO A DUMPSTER

06:19.708 --> 06:20.959
BEHIND THE RED LOBSTER
IN CENTERVILLE.

06:20.959 --> 06:25.500
YEAH, GOOD TO KNOW.
WELL, YOU LOOK, UH...

06:25.500 --> 06:27.041
HIP, HANDSOME, HETERO?

06:27.041 --> 06:29.041
I WAS GONNA
SLICK, SLEAZY,

06:29.041 --> 06:31.708
AND SMARMY,
BUT SURE.

06:31.708 --> 06:35.542
OK. YOUR SEXUALITY,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

06:35.542 --> 06:37.166
IS JUST AS DUBIOUS
AS EVER.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.208
GOOD TO SEE THAT SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE, DOUG.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.250
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MUSTANG?

06:42.250 --> 06:44.959
IT MADE FOR A MOST
EXCELLENT TRADE-IN.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.708
AND, UH, YOU THINK
YOU CAN GIVE ME A HAND

06:46.708 --> 06:48.166
WITH ALL THIS STUFF?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.708
JEEZ, PACEY!
DON'T TELL ME

06:50.708 --> 06:51.834
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY
HAD THE POOR SENSE

06:51.834 --> 06:53.250
TO GIVE YOU
A CREDIT CARD?

06:53.250 --> 06:55.375
WELL, YOU SEEM
TO FORGET, MAN,

06:55.375 --> 06:57.166
I ACTUALLY WORK
FOR A LIVING.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.917
OH, RIGHT. SO YOU
FINALLY BAILED

06:59.917 --> 07:01.125
ON THE COOKING THING
AND GOT YOURSELF

07:01.125 --> 07:03.083
A NICE LITTLE CRACK
COCAINE FRANCHISE.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.917
IF ONLY IT
WERE THAT GLAMOROUS.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.917
NO, I'M A WORKING STIFF
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.417
EXCEPT FOR THAT
WHEN YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT

07:08.417 --> 07:10.208
AND YOU HAVE THE NICE WARM
SATISFACTION OF KNOWING

07:10.208 --> 07:12.083
YOU'VE MADE THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE,

07:12.083 --> 07:14.750
I JUST HAVE A BIG, FAT
STINKING WAD OF CASH.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.875
AIN'T LIFE GRAND?
HA HA HA!

07:34.458 --> 07:35.583
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

07:35.583 --> 07:36.917
MUST YOU QUESTION
MY EVERY IMPULSE,

07:36.917 --> 07:38.875
MY EVERY ROMANTIC WHIM?
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

07:38.875 --> 07:40.500
IT WAS SIMPLY
A THANK YOU.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.917
FOR WHAT?

07:41.917 --> 07:43.333
OH, FOR TAKING ME
DEEP IN THE HEARTLAND

07:43.333 --> 07:45.166
FOR AN OLD-SCHOOL
AMERICAN CHRISTMAS,

07:45.166 --> 07:46.625
FOR INTRODUCING ME
TO YOUR MOTHER,

07:46.625 --> 07:49.625
WHO I MUST SAY
IS QUITE A TRIP,

07:49.625 --> 07:51.625
AND FOR JUST BEING YOU.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.041
I'S A LUCKY GIRL,
DAWSON.

07:53.041 --> 07:54.917
DID MY MOM EVER STOP
GRILLING YOU?

07:54.917 --> 07:56.750
NOT SO MUCH, NO.
I THINK SHE'S CURIOUS

07:56.750 --> 07:57.834
ABOUT MY INTENTIONS.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.625
WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.750
WELL, I SAID,

08:01.750 --> 08:03.083
ASIDE FROM BANGING IN
THE NEW YEAR

08:03.083 --> 08:04.166
WITH HER
ONE AND ONLY SON,

08:04.166 --> 08:06.959
I DIDN'T MUCH KNOW
OR CARE.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.125
NICELY PUT.
MM-HMM.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.959
HEH!

08:10.959 --> 08:12.875
DO YOU THINK SHE'S SAFE
IN THERE WITH TODD?

08:12.875 --> 08:14.208
OH, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE'S SAFE

08:14.208 --> 08:15.917
FROM A DRUNK
AND HORNY TODD.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.166
I'LL GO PRY THEM
APART.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.959
THANK YOU.

08:25.959 --> 08:28.000
AH, WELL, THAT NATASHA
IS A TRIP.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
THAT'S, UH, ONE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.792
SO, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU TWO?

08:35.792 --> 08:38.000
WHATEVER DO YOU
MEAN, MOTHER?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
WELL, IS IT SERIOUS?
IS SHE LIKE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
OR IS THIS SOME KIND
OF CASUAL SEX THING?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.041
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

08:44.041 --> 08:47.125
THAT'S--SECOND,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.792
I DON'T KNOW. I'M
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

08:48.792 --> 08:50.834
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT'S HEADED

08:50.834 --> 08:51.875
OR HOW TO DEFINE IT.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.375
HMM. AND
THAT'S OK WITH YOU?

08:54.375 --> 08:55.458
I DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE
IN THE MATTER.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.000
IT'S JUST...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.166
WHAT, THE WAY THEY DO
THINGS IN CALIFORNIA?

08:59.166 --> 09:01.917
UH, YEAH, APPARENTLY.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.041
HMPH. WELL,
IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME
THE DAY WOULD COME

09:05.041 --> 09:07.041
WHEN MY SON
WOULD BE BRINGING HOME
HIS MOVIE STAR GIRLFRIEND

09:07.041 --> 09:10.000
AND SOME BIG-TIME
DIRECTOR FOR CHRISTMAS,

09:10.000 --> 09:11.750
I WOULD'VE
LAUGHED IN THEIR FACE.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.000
YEAH, ME TOO,
PROBABLY.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.834
YOU KNOW WHO'D GET A KICK
OUT OF THIS, DON'T YOU?

09:15.834 --> 09:17.041
YOUR FATHER.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.000
YEAH.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.750
GOD, HE'D
HAVE LOVED IT.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.166
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK
HE'D ENJOY

09:22.166 --> 09:24.000
WATCHING YOUR BOSS
HIT ON ME.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.792
Todd: NOW SNAG YOUR EGG NOG...

09:25.792 --> 09:27.250
ME MUM'S FAVORITE RECIPE.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.041
HERE, GET SOME OF THAT
DOWN YA.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.708
BLOODY HELL, LEERY,
DIDN'T I TEACH YOU

09:37.708 --> 09:39.750
HOW TO DRINK BETTER
THAN THAT?

09:40.375 --> 09:42.375
UH, WELL,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:42.375 --> 09:43.917
I HAVE TO GO CHECK
ON OUR DINNER.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.250
DO YOU NEED ANY HELP,
MRS. LEERY?

09:45.250 --> 09:46.917
UH, NO, BUT YOU
COULD KEEP ME COMPANY,

09:46.917 --> 09:49.041
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT WORKING
WITH MAX WINTER.

09:49.041 --> 09:51.917
IS HE LIKE BEAUTIFUL
IN PERSON OR...

09:51.917 --> 09:53.041
Todd: SPEAKING OF
ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL,

09:53.041 --> 09:55.917
YOUR MOM'S QUITE
A HANDSOME WOMAN, LEERY.

09:55.917 --> 09:57.708
DO YOU MIND
IF I HAVE A GO AT HER?

09:59.041 --> 10:00.041
WHAT?

10:03.291 --> 10:10.333
♪♪

10:39.083 --> 10:40.750
AUNTIE JOEY, AUNTIE JOEY,
IT'S CHRISTMAS!

10:40.750 --> 10:43.000
Joey:
UNH. ALEXANDER.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.583
HONEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE EXCITED AND ALL,

10:44.583 --> 10:46.959
BUT IT'S WAY TOO EARLY
TO OPEN GIFTS.

10:46.959 --> 10:48.291
NOOOO.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.250
OH, BE NICE
TO AUNTIE JOEY.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.917
SHE'S VERY TIRED.

10:52.917 --> 10:54.875
HER CRAZY FRIEND AUDREY
KEPT HER UP ALL NIGHT.

10:56.125 --> 11:00.250
GRANDPA, PRESENTS! COME ON
EVERYBODY..

11:00.250 --> 11:02.291
JOEY.

11:02.291 --> 11:05.750
I KNOW. COMING.

11:05.750 --> 11:06.917
WHAT DOES A GIRL
HAVE TO DO

11:06.917 --> 11:08.917
TO GET SOME SLEEP
AROUND HERE?

11:08.917 --> 11:10.291
WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS,
TO YOU, TOO, SWEETHEART.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.708
OH, SORRY, DAD.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.792
WELL, I GUESS WE
SHOULD GET TO IT, THEN.

11:16.792 --> 11:19.333
HELL HATH NO FURY
LIKE A 4-YEAR-OLD
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.000
NOT SO FAST.
THERE'S SOMEONE WAITING
FOR YOU AT THE DOOR.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.166
WELL, WHO IS IT?

11:23.166 --> 11:24.834
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I WERE YOU,

11:24.834 --> 11:26.208
I WOULDN'T KEEP HIM
WAITING MUCH LONGER.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.458
HE LOOKS
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.083
(SIGHS)

12:18.708 --> 12:20.500
NOBODY LIKES YOU.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.542
YOU ARE A LOSER.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.458
AND DON'T FORGET IT.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.583
HEY! WHERE'S
TONY AND MARIA?

12:31.583 --> 12:33.250
Mike:
OUT ON THE PORCH.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.750
OHH. DITCHED
FOR THE BOYFRIEND
YET AGAIN.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.917
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY, AUDREY?

12:40.917 --> 12:43.917
HMM. CHIP
ON HIS SHOULDER,
BLUE ON HIS COLLAR.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.667
I DON'T KNOW.
JOEY SEEMS
TO LIKE HIM.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.250
IS IT SERIOUS?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.708
OH, WELL,
LIKE A HEART ATTACK,

12:50.708 --> 12:52.375
BECAUSE YOU SEE,

12:52.375 --> 12:54.375
EDDIE SEEMS TO BE
ABLE TO INCORPORATE

12:54.375 --> 12:56.959
ALL THE BEST
ELEMENTS OF PACEY
AND DAWSON,

12:56.959 --> 13:00.583
SO IT'S
LIKE THE T-1000
OF LOVE INTERESTS.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.708
INTERESTING.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.750
QUID PRO QUO,
MR. POTTER.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.917
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT PRISON?

13:06.542 --> 13:07.917
I WAS RIGHT,
YOU KNOW.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.041
ABOUT WHAT?

13:09.041 --> 13:10.917
YOU DO LOOK VERY
NICE IN A SWEATER.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.875
YEAH, WELL,
I STILL HATE 'EM.

13:15.291 --> 13:18.417
SO WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

13:18.417 --> 13:21.125
I MISSED YOU.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.708
I MISSED YOU.

13:24.792 --> 13:28.708
WELL,
YOU CAN GO NOW.

13:28.708 --> 13:29.834
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE AT THE CRITICAL
JUNCTURE

13:29.834 --> 13:32.083
OF TOO MUCH TOO SOON
FOR TOO LONG.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.750
OH, SHUT UP.
COME HERE.

13:40.458 --> 13:41.708
AHEM.

13:44.959 --> 13:48.000
HEH HEH HEH.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.750
HI, DAD.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.750
HI, YOUR SISTER
NEEDS SOME HELP
IN THE KITCHEN.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.375
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT BODIE WAS FOR.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.375
OH.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.625
ARE YOU GONNA
BE OK OUT HERE?

13:59.625 --> 14:03.000
WELL, AS LONG AS
YOUR FATHER PROMISES
TO GO EASY ON ME.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.667
I'LL BE GENTLE,
I PROMISE.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.166
I'M OK.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.125
OK.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.667
AHEM. IT'S BEAUTIFUL
OUT HERE, HUH?

14:15.667 --> 14:18.500
YEAH, IT IS.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.208
SO, UH, TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELF, EDDIE.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.792
SURE. WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

14:22.792 --> 14:24.834
UH...

14:24.834 --> 14:26.208
WHERE DO YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

14:26.208 --> 14:29.166
I DON'T, ACTUALLY.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.333
YOU GRADUATE?

14:31.333 --> 14:33.166
NO. I NEVER
REALLY WENT.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.917
COLLEGE AND I,
IT NEVER REALLY
TOOK, YOU KNOW.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.417
YEAH, I SEE.

14:39.417 --> 14:41.834
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

14:43.875 --> 14:47.208
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY
IN BETWEEN OCCUPATIONS
AT THE MOMENT.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.000
I WAS TENDING BAR
FOR A WHILE, BUT
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.375
SO I GUESS NOW I'M
JUST TAKE SOME TIME OFF,

14:54.375 --> 14:55.834
YOU KNOW, FIGURE OUT
MY NEXT MOVE.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.250
I SEE.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.875
HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOUR DAUGHTER
IS GREAT, MR. POTTER.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.792
YES, SHE IS.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.917
(DOOR OPENS)

15:33.250 --> 15:35.125
YOUR MOM
IS IN THE KITCHEN,

15:35.125 --> 15:37.083
YOUR LITTLE SISTER
IS NAPPING,

15:37.083 --> 15:38.625
TODD IS PASSED OUT
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

15:38.625 --> 15:40.125
AND THE REST
OF THE GUESTS

15:40.125 --> 15:43.375
AREN'T DUE
TO ARRIVE FOR
ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.875
LET'S GO, DAWSON.
YOU GOT WORK TO DO.

15:44.875 --> 15:45.917
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

15:45.917 --> 15:47.542
TO HEAVEN AND HELL
AND BACK AGAIN.

15:47.542 --> 15:48.583
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX

15:48.583 --> 15:51.583
IN YOUR
CHILDHOOD BEDROOM,

15:51.583 --> 15:53.250
A PLACE WHERE YOU'VE
PROBABLY ONLY HAD
SEX WITH YOURSELF.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.708
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

15:54.708 --> 15:56.583
DOESN'T TAKE
A ROCKET SCIENTIST.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.417
HEH HEH HEH. THE THOUGHT
OF DOING IT IN THIS ROOM

15:59.417 --> 16:00.625
DOESN'T CREEP YOU OUT
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

16:00.625 --> 16:03.625
HELL, NO. TURNS ME ON.
LET'S GO, CITIZEN.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.166
(SIGHS)

16:15.166 --> 16:16.583
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

16:16.583 --> 16:18.417
NOTHING.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.333
I'M NOT SENSING
THE APPROPRIATE
DEGREE OF ENTHUSIASM.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.291
I DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE YOUR
FULL ATTENTION HERE.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.000
IS IT THE WHOLE
CHILDHOOD BEDROOM THING?

16:24.000 --> 16:24.917
BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WOULD ADD

16:24.917 --> 16:27.625
A NICE SPLASH OF KINK
TO THE PROCEEDINGS,

16:27.625 --> 16:28.750
BUT WE DON'T
HAVE TO DO IT.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.417
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.667
THEN WHAT IS IT?

16:36.625 --> 16:38.125
MAX WINTER.

16:38.125 --> 16:41.458
WELL, NO WONDER
YOU'RE NOT HERE
WITH ME, THEN.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.000
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE THINKING

16:43.000 --> 16:45.125
ABOUT HUNKY MATINEE
IDOLS, DAWSON.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.166
YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING

16:46.166 --> 16:47.917
ABOUT YOUR
ORIENTATION,
PERHAPS?

16:47.917 --> 16:50.834
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

16:50.834 --> 16:54.291
(SIGHS) YES, I DO.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.333
AND WHILE
YOUR JEALOUSY
IS SWEET AND ALL,

16:56.333 --> 16:58.000
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.959
MAX WINTER
IS LONG GONE.

16:59.959 --> 17:01.500
YOU LIED TO ME.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.542
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:02.542 --> 17:04.625
YOU LIED TO ME.
YOU SAID YOU WERE

17:04.625 --> 17:06.333
ALONE IN YOUR ROOM
WATCHING TV.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.541
YEAH.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.250
I SAW HIM
LEAVE YOUR ROOM.

17:10.250 --> 17:14.458
SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

17:14.458 --> 17:17.125
MY POINT IS
IT BOTHERS ME.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.000
OK, LOOK,
I--I--I THOUGHT
I COULD PLAY THE GAME

17:20.000 --> 17:21.125
AND JUST
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT,

17:21.125 --> 17:22.834
BUT I CAN'T, OK?
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.708
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
WE'RE DOING.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.750
WE'RE HAVING FUN,
DAWSON.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.250
AT LEAST...

17:28.250 --> 17:29.708
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.708
THAT'S CRAP.
IF IT WAS JUST FUN,

17:31.708 --> 17:32.834
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN SO UPSET

17:32.834 --> 17:33.875
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
ABOUT JOEY.

17:33.875 --> 17:37.750
WELL, I WAS
JUST BEING DRAMATIC.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.583
COME ON. I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT FOR A SECOND.

17:40.583 --> 17:44.250
BELIEVE IT. IT'S ALL
ABOUT EGO, DAWSON.

17:44.250 --> 17:47.625
NO GIRL WANTS TO BE
DUMPED BY SOME GUY

17:47.625 --> 17:50.125
THAT SHE'S EMBARKING
ON A FUN LITTLE
FLING WITH,

17:50.125 --> 17:52.708
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S THE DIRECTOR'S
ASSISTANT.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.583
SO THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS TO YOU--
IS SOME FUN LITTLE FLING.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.750
UGH! ARE YOU
ON YOUR PERIOD
RIGHT NOW, DAWSON?

17:57.750 --> 17:58.792
I JUST WASN'T CLEAR
BEFORE, BUT NOW I AM.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.041
YOU--I GET IT. YOU GET
SOME PERVERSE LITTLE THRILL

18:01.041 --> 18:02.458
OUT OF
SCREWING THE HELP.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.458
YOU KNOW WHAT? HEH.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.750
YOU CRACK ME UP, DAWSON,

18:14.750 --> 18:17.583
BECAUSE YOU STAND HERE
AND YOU SAY
THESE INCREDIBLY NOBLE,

18:17.583 --> 18:19.375
INCREDIBLY
SELF-AGGRANDIZING THINGS

18:19.375 --> 18:20.583
ABOUT HOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO PLAY THE GAME,

18:20.583 --> 18:23.458
WHEN THE TRUTH IS
YOU BROUGHT ME HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS,

18:23.458 --> 18:25.417
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME

18:25.417 --> 18:27.417
THAT YOU DON'T GET SOME
KIND OF PERVERSE THRILL

18:27.417 --> 18:29.166
OUT OF SHOWING ME OFF TO
YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.750
IT'S REALLY
QUITE A SHAME, DAWSON,

18:35.750 --> 18:39.583
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE A DAY
WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND GRAY

18:39.583 --> 18:41.333
AND NOT EVEN THE VIAGRA'S
DOING IT FOR YOU ANYMORE,

18:41.333 --> 18:43.542
AND YOU COULD'VE
LOOKED BACK FONDLY

18:43.542 --> 18:45.583
ON THAT TIME YOU BANGED
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS

18:45.583 --> 18:47.208
OUT OF THAT ACTRESS
IN YOUR CHILDHOOD BEDROOM

18:47.208 --> 18:49.458
WHILE SHE
STILL HAD HER LOOKS.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.291
BUT I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

18:51.291 --> 18:52.625
FOR THINKING
WITH YOUR BRAIN

18:52.625 --> 18:54.708
WHEN YOU REALLY SHOULD
BE THINKING WITH YOUR--

18:54.708 --> 18:57.125
WELL, I THINK YOU KNOW.

18:59.792 --> 19:03.250
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

19:13.291 --> 19:15.250
WATCH YOUR STEP SWEETY, ITS
ICY..

19:15.250 --> 19:16.375
I WILL.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.625
COME ON, BUDDY. --WOW
COME ON, CHIEF, YOU HUNGRY?..

19:21.625 --> 19:23.625
SO, THIS IS THE GUY FROM
THE NO DOUBT CONCERT

19:23.625 --> 19:25.625
WHO'S ALSO THE SAME GUY
FROM THE MOVIE SET?

19:25.625 --> 19:26.959
DAWSON. YEAH.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.834
DAWSON. RIGHT.
YEAH, AND WHY
ARE WE HERE AGAIN?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.041
IS IT GONNA BE
WEIRD FOR YOU?

19:31.041 --> 19:32.250
YEAH, I GOT NO BEEF
WITH THE GUY,

19:32.250 --> 19:33.333
AND IF HE'S
GOT BEEF WITH ME,

19:33.333 --> 19:35.375
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I COULD TAKE HIM.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.458
WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'LL COME TO THAT,

19:36.458 --> 19:38.750
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

19:38.750 --> 19:42.458
THE QUESTION IS, JO,
IS THAT WILL IT
BE WEIRD FOR YOU?

19:42.458 --> 19:44.500
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN,
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.708
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'LL ALWAYS BE,

19:46.708 --> 19:48.500
BUT LOOK,
DON'T WORRY.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.834
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A NICE, CIVIL
CHRISTMAS DINNER,

19:49.834 --> 19:50.708
AND THEN
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

19:50.708 --> 19:53.375
WHAT, NO DESSERT?
I DO LIKE PIE, YOU KNOW.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.708
AS I RECALL.

19:55.708 --> 19:58.000
I WAS HOPING WE
COULD FIND SOME TIME
TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.834
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

19:59.834 --> 20:02.000
I HAVE TO SPEND
SOME OWN TIME
WITH MY FAMILY,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.375
YOU KNOW, BUT I
WAS THINKING MAYBE--

20:04.375 --> 20:06.041
I'D LOVE TO.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.583
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.875
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD BE AGREEING

20:08.875 --> 20:12.041
TO AN ACT
OF SEXUAL CONGRESS.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.375
SO YOU WEREN'T ASKING ME
TO COME HOME WITH YOU.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.333
NO, I AM.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.083
WELL, LIKE I SAID,
I WOULD LOVE TO.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.500
COOL. AND I PROMISE

20:21.500 --> 20:23.500
MY FAMILY WILL BE
A LOT LESS INTIMIDATING.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.583
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.667
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

20:26.667 --> 20:29.542
IS YOUR DAD ALWAYS SO HARD
ON PROSPECTIVE SUITORS?

20:29.542 --> 20:31.375
WHY? WHAT DID
HE SAY TO YOU?

20:31.375 --> 20:33.667
NAH, I'M JUST TEASING.
FORGET IT.

20:33.667 --> 20:34.917
I'M NOT GONNA FORGET IT.
EDDIE, IF MY DAD
WAS RUDE TO YOU,

20:34.917 --> 20:36.875
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:38.083 --> 20:39.875
HE WASN'T RUDE AT ALL.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.542
HE SEEMS LIKE
A REALLY GREAT GUY.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.291
(CHUCKLES)

20:57.291 --> 21:00.417
SWEET RIDE, PACEY.

21:00.417 --> 21:01.417
THANKS FOR
THE TEST DRIVE.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.708
ANY TIME.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.291
ISN'T THE NAVIGATION
SYSTEM AMAZING?

21:04.291 --> 21:06.750
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S AMAZING.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.750
HEY, DO YOU THINK
DAD LIKED HIS PALM PILOT?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.750
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T REALLY
SEEM ALL THAT EXCITED.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.625
WELL, I THINK
HE WAS A LITTLE
OVERWHELMED, PACE.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.166
I THINK WE ALL WERE.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.250
HEY, THERE'S
ONE OTHER THING
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.291
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BREAK IT OUT

21:20.291 --> 21:21.792
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE FAMILY,
BUT CHECK IT OUT.

21:21.792 --> 21:23.959
PACEY, YOU HAVE BEEN
EXTREMELY GENEROUS.

21:23.959 --> 21:24.917
I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING ELSE.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.458
OH, COME ON. OPEN IT UP.
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.166
(EXHALES)

21:33.166 --> 21:36.166
PACE, THIS--THIS
IS ABOVE AND BEYOND.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.834
YEAH, AND, YOU SEE,
NOW YOU CAN GET
RID OF THAT ONE

21:37.834 --> 21:39.625
YOU'VE HAD SINCE
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.583
HEY, I'LL TELL YA,
I LOVE THIS WATCH, OK?

21:41.583 --> 21:42.583
IT LIGHTS UP
AND EVERYTHING.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.333
SURE, BUT CAN IT TELL YOU
THE TIME IN PORTUGAL?

21:44.333 --> 21:45.375
I THINK NOT.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.166
PACE, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

21:48.166 --> 21:49.792
SURE.

21:49.792 --> 21:53.125
THIS JOB OF YOURS,

21:53.125 --> 21:54.667
IS IT ON
THE UP AND UP?

21:57.083 --> 21:57.959
"ON THE UP AND UP"?

21:57.959 --> 21:59.625
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE 50 YEARS OLD, DOUG.

21:59.625 --> 22:00.792
YOU SOUND LIKE DAD.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.667
LOOK AT IT FROM
MY PERSPECTIVE, PACE.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.291
YOU COME HOME
WITH THIS NEW CAR,

22:04.291 --> 22:05.625
YOU GOT FLASHY
NEW CLOTHES,

22:05.625 --> 22:06.792
EXPENSIVE GIFTS
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.583
EXCUSE ME IF IT SEEMS
JUST A LITTLE TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.583
RIGHT, RIGHT. I FORGOT.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.625
YET ANOTHER REASON
WHY IT SUCKS
TO BE A WITTER,

22:14.625 --> 22:16.750
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.000
YOU COULDN'T
JUST, I DON'T KNOW,
SAY, BE PROUD OF ME.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.834
YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE TO ACCUSE ME
OF BEING INVOLVED

22:20.834 --> 22:22.375
IN SOME SORT OF
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.166
PACEY, I'M NOT ACCUSING
YOU OF ANYTHING.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.375
I'M JUST WONDERING
HOW MUCH YOU KNOW

22:25.375 --> 22:26.875
ABOUT YOUR PLACE OF
EMPLOYMENT, THAT'S ALL.

22:26.875 --> 22:30.083
WHAT IS THIS, MAN?
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR ME.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.625
ARE YOU JEALOUS
OR SOMETHING?

22:31.625 --> 22:35.125
IS THIS ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY
I'VE BEEN MAKING?

22:35.125 --> 22:38.041
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, PACE.

22:38.041 --> 22:41.792
MAYBE I AM JEALOUS,
I DON'T KNOW.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.333
OR MAYBE I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

23:12.041 --> 23:14.708
(HUMS SANTA CLAUS
IS COMING TO TOWN)

23:29.542 --> 23:31.500
(PEOPLE CHATTING)

23:34.750 --> 23:38.542
SO WHERE THE HELL
IS JACK?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.083
ARE YOU DRUNK?
YES,

23:40.083 --> 23:41.750
BUT THAT DOES
NOT EXPLAIN
WHERE JACK IS.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.125
IN EUROPE WITH
HIS DAD AND ANDIE.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.750
DOPE.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.750
EVELYN, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SAY GRACE?

23:47.750 --> 23:51.542
I WOULDN'T MIND
LEADING US IN PRAYER, GALE.

23:51.542 --> 23:54.417
OH, WELL, THAT WOULD
BE LOVELY, TODD.

23:54.417 --> 23:55.917
THANK YOU.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.417
DEARLY BELOVED,

23:57.417 --> 23:59.250
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

23:59.250 --> 24:02.542
TO CELEBRATE
THE BIRTH OF YOUR SON.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.917
NOW I'M AT
A DISADVANTAGE HERE.

24:04.917 --> 24:08.250
MANY OF YOU, I'M SURE,
KNOW WHO I AM.

24:08.250 --> 24:11.083
I AM A FILMMAKER,

24:11.083 --> 24:14.583
CELEBRATED
ON MANY CONTINENTS,

24:14.583 --> 24:16.083
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOU,

24:16.083 --> 24:19.583
WHICH IS A TRAVESTY
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

24:19.583 --> 24:21.333
REGULAR PEOPLE,

24:21.333 --> 24:23.083
ARE MY TARGET AUDIENCE.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.959
Todd: EXCEPT YOU, BLONDIE.

24:27.959 --> 24:30.500
YOU LOOK
VERY FAMILIAR TO ME.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.208
YOU HIT ON ME ON A--

24:33.208 --> 24:35.125
ON A PLANE ONCE
FROM BOSTON TO NEW YORK.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.792
DID WE SHAG?
NO.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.291
ARE YOU SURE?

24:38.291 --> 24:39.625
BECAUSE I'M FLASHING

24:39.625 --> 24:42.250
ON SOME SORT OF
MILE-HIGH CLUB ACTIVITY.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.166
(LAUGHS)
NO, THAT WASN'T ME.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.875
WELL, GOOD,

24:44.875 --> 24:46.166
'CAUSE THAT'D
BE EMBARRASSING.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.166
Todd: WHERE WAS I?

24:49.250 --> 24:50.792
OH, YES,
THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.

24:50.792 --> 24:54.125
LET ME START WITH
WHAT I AM THANKFUL FOR.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.834
I AM THANKFUL FOR GALE...

24:57.458 --> 24:59.708
FOR INVITING US
INTO HER LOVELY HOME.

25:01.291 --> 25:05.041
AND I AM THANKFUL
TO HER PROGENY DAWSON.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.834
PROGENY.

25:07.834 --> 25:10.333
PROGENY.

25:10.333 --> 25:13.166
HER PROGENY DAWSON.

25:13.166 --> 25:17.583
THIS KID HAS BEEN
AN INVALUABLE MEMBER
OF MY PRODUCTION TEAM.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.792
HE'S HELPED ME THROUGH ONE
OF THE ROUGHEST PRODUCTIONS

25:19.792 --> 25:23.291
KNOWN TO GOD AND MAN,

25:23.291 --> 25:24.458
AND I LOVE HIM.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.875
I LOVE HIM
VERY MUCH, DAWSON.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.291
AND THE FUNNY THING IS

25:34.291 --> 25:36.166
HE'S MANAGED
TO GET HIMSELF INVOLVED

25:36.166 --> 25:39.250
IN A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

25:39.250 --> 25:42.500
WHICH REMINDS ME
OF MY FIRST FILM ACTUALLY,

25:42.500 --> 25:45.542
EXCEPT SHE WAS
WHAT WE CALL UNDERAGE,

25:45.542 --> 25:47.333
SO WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.417
TODD?

25:48.417 --> 25:49.708
YES, DAWSON?

25:49.708 --> 25:51.625
WELL, COULD
WE WRAP IT UP?

25:53.375 --> 25:55.917
FORGIVE ME.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.083
FORGIVE ME, GALE.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.166
I, UH, HAVE TO SAY THAT
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED

26:13.166 --> 26:14.792
WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH YOUR LIFE, DAWSON.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.333
I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN
THIS KID SINCE
HE WAS RUNNING AROUND

26:17.333 --> 26:19.834
MAKING MOVIES
WITH A VIDEO CAMERA.

26:19.834 --> 26:22.500
IT'S REALLY AMAZING TO
SEE HOW FAR HE'S COME.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.583
THANK YOU, MR. POTTER.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.458
MAYBE YOU GUYS
HAVE AN OPENING
FOR EDDIE HERE.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.208
YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR WORK,
AREN'T YOU, EDDIE?

26:30.583 --> 26:32.250
Todd: I LIKE EDDIE.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.625
WE NEVER FOUND A REPLACEMENT
FOR PHIL THE P.A., DID WE?

26:34.625 --> 26:36.458
YEAH, WELL,
FILM'S NOT REALLY MY THING,

26:36.458 --> 26:39.291
BUT THANKS FOR THINKING
ABOUT ME, MR. POTTER.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.125
WHAT IS
YOUR THING, EDDIE?

26:40.125 --> 26:41.875
Joey: DAD.

26:41.875 --> 26:42.667
WHAT? I'M CURIOUS.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.417
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE BEING A DICK.

26:44.417 --> 26:45.792
JOEY.
MR. POTTER?

26:46.583 --> 26:48.041
YES, AUDREY?

26:48.041 --> 26:51.041
CAN I ASK YOU
ANOTHER QUESTION
ABOUT PRISON?

26:51.041 --> 26:52.291
SURE, AUDREY.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.708
YEAH.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.083
SO...

26:56.083 --> 26:57.417
WHY IS IT
THAT YOU DON'T THINK

26:57.417 --> 27:00.375
EDDIE'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER?

27:00.375 --> 27:02.250
AUDREY.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.708
BACK OFF.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.125
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM,
PRINCESS?

27:05.125 --> 27:07.250
I WAS STICKING UP
FOR JOE DIRT OVER THERE.

27:08.625 --> 27:09.792
THIS ISN'T
GONNA END WELL.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.333
WOULD YOU SHUT UP, PACEY?

27:13.000 --> 27:13.834
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE, AUDREY.

27:13.834 --> 27:15.250
OF COURSE I AM.

27:15.250 --> 27:18.125
ANYONE MESSES WITH
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY,

27:18.125 --> 27:20.417
AND YOU GET ALL UP
ON YOUR HIGH HORSE,
DON'T YOU?

27:20.417 --> 27:21.625
AUDREY.

27:21.625 --> 27:22.625
OH, EXCELLENT.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.625
ANOTHER PARTY
HEARD FROM.

27:23.625 --> 27:24.458
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
LINDLEY?

27:27.959 --> 27:30.291
I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEM.

27:30.291 --> 27:30.959
OH.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.250
DEVILISHLY CLEVER
OF YOU, JEN.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.041
OH, HONEY,
ARE YOU STILL UPSET

27:37.041 --> 27:38.458
THAT I SHAGGED
YOUR DREAM BOY?

27:38.458 --> 27:40.083
BECAUSE I AM
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.542
Jen: WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE?

27:41.542 --> 27:43.625
I MISSED MY FLIGHT,
BITCH,

27:43.625 --> 27:46.417
WHICH IS REALLY
TERRIBLY UNFORTUNATE

27:46.417 --> 27:48.458
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
THAT SPENDING
CHRISTMAS HERE

27:48.458 --> 27:49.667
ON WALTON MOUNTAIN

27:49.667 --> 27:51.500
IS MY IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME,

27:51.500 --> 27:54.125
THEN YOU ALL
ARE ABOUT AS HIGH
AS I AM RIGHT NOW.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.583
AUDREY, WHY DON'T YOU
GO LAY DOWN?

27:56.583 --> 27:58.959
OH, YOU KNOW,
THANKS FOR THAT,
GALE, REALLY,

27:58.959 --> 28:01.500
BUT I THINK
I'M KIND OF JUST
GETTING STARTED HERE.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.458
DO ANY OF YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA

28:03.458 --> 28:05.500
HOW INCREDIBLY
HYPOCRITICAL

28:05.500 --> 28:07.083
THIS WHOLE
LITTLE GATHERING IS?

28:07.083 --> 28:08.834
I MEAN,
I MAY BE FLYING HIGH

28:08.834 --> 28:10.667
ON A PLEASINGLY
POTENT COCKTAIL

28:10.667 --> 28:12.625
OF VODKA
AND PAINKILLERS--

28:12.625 --> 28:14.708
AND THANK YOU,
BY THE WAY, GALE,
FOR THE PAINKILLERS,

28:14.708 --> 28:16.583
BUT I SEEM
TO BE SEEING THINGS

28:16.583 --> 28:19.792
A LITTLE BIT CLEARER
THAN ANY OF YOU.

28:19.792 --> 28:20.792
DAWSON.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.250
PACEY.

28:23.959 --> 28:25.667
YOU GUYS HATE
EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.542
YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO BE ABLE TO--

28:27.542 --> 28:29.000
TO MEND
THIS LITTLE RIFT

28:29.000 --> 28:30.792
THAT EXISTS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

28:30.792 --> 28:32.542
SO WHY DO YOU EVEN
BOTHER WITH THE CHARADE?

28:32.542 --> 28:33.542
AND DAWSON AND JOEY,

28:33.542 --> 28:35.542
(AUDREY LAUGHS)

28:35.542 --> 28:37.250
HERE YOU ARE,
BOTH OF YOU,

28:37.250 --> 28:39.667
ALL GROWN UP
AND SO VERY PLEASED
WITH YOURSELVES,

28:39.667 --> 28:41.000
AND EACH WITH YOUR
LITTLE SIGNIFICANT OTHER

28:41.000 --> 28:42.750
BY YOUR SIDE
RESPECTIVELY,

28:42.750 --> 28:44.208
AND WHILE, YOU KNOW,
I WILL GIVE YOU

28:44.208 --> 28:46.750
THAT IT DOES MAKE
FOR A PRETTY PICTURE,

28:46.750 --> 28:47.750
THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS

28:47.750 --> 28:48.875
YOU GUYS
FINALLY SLEPT TOGETHER,

28:48.875 --> 28:50.875
AND YOU'VE NEVER
REALLY DEALT WITH IT,

28:50.875 --> 28:52.708
AND NEITHER OF YOU
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

28:52.708 --> 28:54.542
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANYONE ELSE

28:54.542 --> 28:56.708
UNTIL YOU JUST FINALLY
DEAL WITH YOUR CRAP

28:56.708 --> 28:58.750
ONCE AND FOR ALL AND--

28:58.750 --> 29:01.708
AS FOR YOU, PACEY,

29:01.708 --> 29:03.875
I AM REALLY SORRY
THAT AUDREY HEPBURN
NEXT TO YOU

29:03.875 --> 29:05.708
BROKE YOUR HEART
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,

29:05.708 --> 29:06.708
AND IT'S PREVENTED YOU

29:06.708 --> 29:08.000
FROM EVER
FULLY COMMITTING

29:08.000 --> 29:10.834
TO AN ADULT
RELATIONSHIP,

29:10.834 --> 29:13.792
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:13.792 --> 29:15.291
JUST GROW UP.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.708
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
SCUMSUCKERS.

29:18.708 --> 29:19.708
PEACE OUT.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.083
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.000
Todd:
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

30:02.792 --> 30:03.917
(CAR STARTS)

30:12.792 --> 30:14.959
(CAR ACCELERATES)

30:35.000 --> 30:36.625
(DEBRIS CRACKS)

30:36.625 --> 30:39.041
YEAH.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.000
I KINDA THINK
I ZAGGED

30:41.000 --> 30:42.625
WHEN I SHOULD
HAVE ZIGGED.

30:50.041 --> 30:50.834
PACEY,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

30:50.834 --> 30:52.333
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO DO HERE?

30:52.333 --> 30:54.291
YES, I'M ASKING YOU
TO KEEP HER
OUT OF TROUBLE

30:54.291 --> 30:56.125
AND JUST MAKE THIS
GO AWAY.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.125
LISTEN TO ME,
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IN THERE IS IN TROUBLE.

30:58.125 --> 30:59.291
SHE NEEDS
SOME SERIOUS HELP.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.542
OK, LOOK, SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE,

31:01.542 --> 31:03.333
AND RIGHT NOW
SHE HATES ME,

31:03.333 --> 31:05.834
SO SHE'S NOT GOING
TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING
I HAVE TO SAY TO HER.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.000
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
I CAN HELP HER, DOUG.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.291
DID YOU EVER THINK
THAT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE BETTER FOR HER

31:09.291 --> 31:11.792
IF SHE DOES GET
INTO TROUBLE FOR THIS?

31:11.792 --> 31:13.333
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.959
I'M ASKING YOU
FOR A FAVOR HERE,

31:14.959 --> 31:16.667
AND IN MY LIFETIME,
I HAVE NOT ASKED YOU
FOR MUCH,

31:16.667 --> 31:17.708
BUT I'M ASKING
FOR THIS.

31:17.708 --> 31:18.917
DOUG, DO THIS
FOR ME, OK?

31:18.917 --> 31:20.291
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.792
PLEASE, DOUG.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.500
YOU WILLING TO TAKE
ALL THE BLAME FOR THIS?

31:29.500 --> 31:31.000
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.917
(LAUGHS)

31:32.917 --> 31:34.542
WHAT? WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

31:34.542 --> 31:36.708
NO, NOTHING. NOTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT, UM--

31:36.708 --> 31:38.417
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GIVEN YOURSELF
QUITE THE MAKEOVER,

31:38.417 --> 31:39.291
HAVEN'T YOU, PACE?

31:39.291 --> 31:41.333
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GROWN
SOME FACIAL HAIR,

31:41.333 --> 31:42.667
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A REAL JOB,

31:42.667 --> 31:43.834
NICE CAR, FANCY CLOTHES,

31:43.834 --> 31:45.208
BUT YOU'RE
STILL THE SAME PACEY.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.041
YOU'RE STILL LOOKING
FOR A QUICK FIX,
AREN'T YOU?

31:47.041 --> 31:48.583
YOU WANT ME TO SWEEP THIS
UNDER THE RUG?

31:48.583 --> 31:49.875
FINE, I'LL DO THAT.

31:49.875 --> 31:50.875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD
THAT'S GONNA ACCOMPLISH

31:50.875 --> 31:51.875
BECAUSE AUDREY
IS GONNA LIVE

31:51.875 --> 31:53.542
TO DRINK AND DRIVE
ANOTHER DAY.

31:53.542 --> 31:56.000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT MAY NOT END UP
SO HAPPY NEXT TIME.

32:01.417 --> 32:03.458
OK.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.917
IF ANYBODY ASKS,

32:05.917 --> 32:07.375
YOU DID THIS.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.375
ALL RIGHT?

32:08.375 --> 32:10.125
NEW CAR,
YOU LOST CONTROL,

32:10.125 --> 32:12.417
YOU'RE A MORON,
PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE YOU.

32:12.417 --> 32:13.166
TRUST ME.

32:16.417 --> 32:19.041
THANK YOU.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.583
AND I'LL PAY
FOR WHATEVER ELSE

32:20.583 --> 32:21.583
NEEDS
TAKING CARE OF.

32:21.583 --> 32:22.750
YEAH, SURE,
THROW SOME MONEY AT IT

32:22.750 --> 32:24.458
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THAT FIXES EVERYTHING.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.583
COME ON, DOUG.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

32:25.583 --> 32:27.417
NO, I'M NOT DONE.

32:27.417 --> 32:30.917
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I NEVER
TOLD YOU THIS, PACEY,

32:30.917 --> 32:33.417
AND IF I DIDN'T,
I AM SO SORRY,

32:33.417 --> 32:35.792
BUT LAST YEAR,
WHEN YOU WERE A COOK,

32:35.792 --> 32:37.375
I WAS PROUD OF YOU.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.625
I WAS HAPPY FOR YOU.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.917
I ACTUALLY ADMIRED YOU,
PACEY.

32:41.917 --> 32:44.667
THERE WAS SOMETHING,

32:44.667 --> 32:46.667
I DON'T KNOW,
HONEST ABOUT IT.

32:47.750 --> 32:52.083
ALMOST NOBLE.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.208
GUESS IT DIDN'T
SUIT YOU, DID IT?

32:56.625 --> 32:57.834
(SIGHS)

33:07.792 --> 33:10.625
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

33:10.625 --> 33:13.834
HOW DO I LOOK,
LINDLEY?

33:13.834 --> 33:15.417
LIKE COMPLETE
AND UTTER CRAP.

33:15.417 --> 33:16.959
(SNORTS)

33:16.959 --> 33:19.959
WELL, THAT SUMS IT UP
NICELY, THANK YOU.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.834
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL YOUR PARENTS?

33:23.834 --> 33:25.875
NO.

33:25.875 --> 33:28.166
JEN, IF YOU DO THAT,
IF YOU--

33:29.667 --> 33:31.834
I SWEAR I WILL MAKE IT
MY LIFE'S PURPOSE

33:31.834 --> 33:33.375
TO KICK YOUR ASS
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO NEW YORK.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.583
OK.

33:38.959 --> 33:41.667
WHY ARE YOU
SO ANGRY, AUDREY?

33:41.667 --> 33:43.708
OK, DR. MELFI, YOU KNOW,

33:43.708 --> 33:45.667
IS THIS SOME SAD ATTEMPT
TO IMPRESS C.J.?

33:45.667 --> 33:47.000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, THE LAST TIME
I CHECKED,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.583
HE'S NOT HERE.

33:49.583 --> 33:50.959
NO, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU.

33:50.959 --> 33:52.500
WELL, DON'T.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.417
OK? JUST...

33:54.417 --> 33:57.500
PRETEND THAT
I AM TOO FAR GONE,

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
WHICH ISN'T THAT FAR
FROM THE TRUTH ANYWAY.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.708
I JUST--I WANNA
BE LEFT ALONE, JEN.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.375
I'M SO SICK AND TIRED
OF YOU PEOPLE.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.166
YOU ALL SAY
THAT YOU WANT TO HELP,

34:06.166 --> 34:07.917
BUT IT'S ALL JUST...

34:07.917 --> 34:08.750
POSTURING,

34:08.750 --> 34:10.333
BECAUSE NONE OF YOU
REALLY NOTICED

34:10.333 --> 34:12.000
HOW SCREWED UP I WAS
UNTIL TONIGHT.

34:14.166 --> 34:16.083
WITH FRIENDS LIKE YOU,
WHO NEEDS ENEMAS?

34:30.375 --> 34:31.291
HEY.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.583
HEY.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.083
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:36.083 --> 34:37.375
BACK TO L.A.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.166
MY MANAGER GOT ME
ON THE LAST FLIGHT OUT.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.000
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
JUST LIKE THAT?

34:41.000 --> 34:44.041
JUST LIKE THAT.

34:44.041 --> 34:44.917
LISTEN, NATASHA,

34:44.917 --> 34:46.083
I'M SORRY
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.667
DON'T BE SORRY.

34:47.667 --> 34:48.917
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.750
I SLEPT
WITH MAX WINTER.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.917
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.166
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

34:59.166 --> 35:00.917
YEAH.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.208
YES.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.583
HONESTLY, I MEAN,
THAT'S GREAT.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.083
THAT'S--

35:06.083 --> 35:09.125
LOOK, DAWSON,
I'M SORRY IF I WAS
RECKLESS WITH YOUR EMOTIONS.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.166
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.250
I THOUGHT
WE WERE HAVING FUN.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.083
I DON'T--
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.041
I NEVER DID.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.583
IT WAS FUN.

35:16.583 --> 35:18.417
SLEEPING WITH YOU
MADE ME FEEL
SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL,

35:18.417 --> 35:19.917
AND, TO BE HONEST,

35:19.917 --> 35:22.583
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD LAST
MUCH PAST WRAP.

35:22.583 --> 35:23.959
YEAH.

35:23.959 --> 35:25.166
WELL...

35:27.250 --> 35:30.208
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:30.208 --> 35:31.625
I DON'T LOVE YOU
EITHER.

35:31.625 --> 35:35.583
OF COURSE
YOU DON'T, SILLY.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.959
LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT
BUILT FOR THIS KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP.

35:37.959 --> 35:40.000
IT'S KIND OF
WHAT I DIG ABOUT YOU.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.041
I AM TOO YOUNG
AND TOO SELF-ABSORBED

35:44.041 --> 35:46.333
TO BE ENTANGLED
IN SOMETHING SO SERIOUS,

35:46.333 --> 35:48.417
AND IF I'M TOO YOUNG,

35:48.417 --> 35:49.583
YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.125
YOU KNOW,

35:55.125 --> 35:56.417
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE

35:56.417 --> 35:59.000
SOME GIRL'S DREAMS
COME TRUE SOMEDAY,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.291
IN A BIG WAY,

36:01.291 --> 36:02.375
WHICH IS WHY
I HAVE TO STOP THIS NOW

36:02.375 --> 36:03.500
BEFORE I BREAK YOUR HEART

36:03.500 --> 36:05.208
AND TURN YOU
INTO A BITTER CYNIC.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.917
DON'T FLATTER
YOURSELF.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.208
(WHISPERING) Yeah.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.792
MERRY CHRISTMAS, DAWSON.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.041
OH.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.458
TODD'S PASSED OUT
IN THE BATHROOM.

36:18.458 --> 36:19.500
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S STILL BREATHING,

36:19.500 --> 36:21.500
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD A MIRROR
UP TO HIS BREATH

36:21.500 --> 36:22.667
JUST TO BE SURE.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.250
THANKS.

36:29.000 --> 36:29.917
(WHISPERING) Bye.

36:36.291 --> 36:39.000
SO IS THIS WHAT
ALL YOUR CHRISTMASES
ARE LIKE, JOEY POTTER?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.333
UM, YOU KNOW,
NOT SO MUCH.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.166
USUALLY
WE SMOKE CRACK
AND WORSHIP SATAN.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.875
THIS WAS PRETTY TAME
BY COMPARISON.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.291
UH, LOOK.
WHAT?

36:52.542 --> 36:54.792
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
COME BACK WITH ME, JOEY.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.166
WHY?

36:57.166 --> 36:59.166
BECAUSE YOU
HAVE PLENTY OF STUFF

36:59.166 --> 37:00.417
TO DEAL WITH
RIGHT HERE.

37:03.250 --> 37:06.417
WHY DO I SENSE
SOME SUBTEXT HERE?

37:08.041 --> 37:09.708
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER
WAS KIND OF A JERK TONIGHT.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.708
YOU KNOW, BUT--

37:11.708 --> 37:15.375
HE WASN'T ALTOGETHER
WRONG ABOUT ME.

37:15.375 --> 37:18.083
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
THE MOST TOGETHER GUY
ON THE PLANET, JOEY.

37:18.083 --> 37:19.542
WHO ASKED YOU TO BE?

37:19.542 --> 37:21.250
WHO EVEN KNOWS
WHAT THAT MEANS?

37:21.250 --> 37:24.375
IT MEANS THAT I SHOULD
HAVE TRUSTED MY GUT.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.458
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.542
WHY?

37:27.542 --> 37:30.083
BECAUSE IT WAS--

37:30.083 --> 37:32.208
IT WAS ALL TOO MUCH
TOO SOON.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.917
I SHOULDN'T BE
DEALING WITH A FATHER
WHO THINKS I'M A LOSER.

37:34.917 --> 37:38.291
I SHOULDN'T BE DEALING
WITH ALL OF THE GHOSTS
OF RELATIONSHIPS PAST.

37:38.291 --> 37:39.875
IT'S TOO MUCH.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.083
YOU KNOW, I--I--

37:43.083 --> 37:44.917
WE NEED TO BE
IN THE HERE AND NOW.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.792
OK.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.917
WELL, THEN,
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.458
FROM NOW ON,
WE'LL BE IN THE HERE
AND NOW, I PROMISE.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.542
OK?

37:56.542 --> 37:58.291
YOU KNOW, THE SAME THING
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

37:58.291 --> 38:00.667
IF YOU WERE AT MY HOUSE,
YOU KNOW.

38:00.667 --> 38:02.333
I MEAN,
YOU'D MEET MY FAMILY,

38:02.333 --> 38:03.583
AND THEY'D
BE VERY IMPRESSED,

38:03.583 --> 38:06.458
BUT ALSO VERY SUSPICIOUS

38:06.458 --> 38:08.417
BECAUSE YOU ARE
SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL,

38:08.417 --> 38:11.708
AND THEY'D WONDER,
"WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE DOING WITH EDDIE?"

38:11.708 --> 38:13.750
AND AFTER,
WHEN YOU WERE GONE...

38:15.291 --> 38:17.625
THEY'D PULL ME ASIDE
AND THEY'D SAY,

38:17.625 --> 38:20.667
"WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, KID?

38:20.667 --> 38:22.375
THAT GIRL'S GONNA
BREAK YOUR HEART."

38:24.291 --> 38:25.625
EDDIE, I HAVE
NO INTENTION

38:25.625 --> 38:28.250
OF BREAKING
YOUR HEART.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.458
YEAH.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.000
NO ONE EVER DOES.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.083
MERRY CHRISTMAS, JOEY.

39:18.333 --> 39:19.333
DIDN'T I
SLEEP WITH YOU ONCE

39:19.333 --> 39:21.166
AND NEVER
TALK TO YOU AGAIN?

39:21.166 --> 39:23.375
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOU.

39:23.375 --> 39:24.417
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

39:24.417 --> 39:25.667
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.041
HAPPENS TO ME
ALL THE TIME.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.458
SO...

39:31.458 --> 39:32.625
SOME NIGHT, HUH?

39:34.708 --> 39:36.333
YEAH.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.000
YEAH.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.875
KINDA PUTS THINGS
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

39:40.875 --> 39:42.333
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

39:42.333 --> 39:45.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,

39:45.041 --> 39:46.583
IF AUDREY HAD MANAGED
TO TAKE US ALL OUT

39:46.583 --> 39:49.083
IN A BLAZE
OF GLORY TONIGHT,

39:49.083 --> 39:51.166
I'D HATE TO THINK THAT
THE LAST MEANINGFUL
CONVERSATION

39:51.166 --> 39:51.875
YOU AND I HAD

39:51.875 --> 39:52.875
WAS THAT ONE
IN YOUR DORM ROOM.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.417
MMM.

39:55.417 --> 39:57.291
YEAH.

39:57.291 --> 40:00.000
SHE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING,
THOUGH, YOU KNOW.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.667
WHAT?

40:02.583 --> 40:04.625
WE NEVER REALLY DEALT
WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.667
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

40:08.667 --> 40:12.208
BUT I KINDA PUT IT
ALL INTO A LITTLE BOX

40:12.208 --> 40:14.542
AND PUSHED IT
FAR, FAR AWAY.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.542
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

40:18.542 --> 40:20.000
HOW IT ALL WENT SO WRONG.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.750
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
TRYING TO FORGET

40:25.750 --> 40:27.291
WE EVER MEANT ANYTHING
TO EACH OTHER.

40:29.417 --> 40:32.375
FAIR ENOUGH.
I DESERVE THAT, I GUESS.

40:32.375 --> 40:33.750
NO, YOU DON'T,

40:33.750 --> 40:35.250
AND THE THING IS,
DAWSON,

40:35.250 --> 40:38.083
IT NEVER WORKS.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.250
A NIGHT LIKE THIS,

40:40.250 --> 40:44.083
IT DOES PUT THINGS
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

40:44.083 --> 40:44.834
SEE...

40:46.375 --> 40:49.083
I THINK SOMETIMES
IT'S EASY FOR ME

40:49.083 --> 40:52.583
TO KIND OF HATE YOU

40:52.583 --> 40:55.542
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE OUT THERE,

40:55.542 --> 40:57.208
AND IF ANYTHING
EVER HAPPENED TO ME

40:57.208 --> 40:58.542
OR IF I EVER
REALLY NEEDED YOU,

40:58.542 --> 40:59.667
YOU'D BE THERE
FOR ME.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.834
IT'S TRUE.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.458
DAWSON, IF THAT'S TRUE,

41:07.458 --> 41:09.750
THEN HOW COME
WE ONLY EVER END UP
HURTING EACH OTHER?

41:18.417 --> 41:20.708
WELL, WE'RE NOT HURTING
EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW.

41:25.959 --> 41:27.125
WELL...

41:29.542 --> 41:31.834
RIGHT NOW IS
AN ILLUSION, THOUGH.

41:33.417 --> 41:34.875
RIGHT NOW
IT'S A TRUCE.

41:37.291 --> 41:40.417
BUT RIGHT NOW,

41:40.417 --> 41:41.458
I JUST WANT
TO STAND HERE

41:41.458 --> 41:42.625
AND TALK
TO THE ONE PERSON

41:42.625 --> 41:45.500
WHO CAN MAYBE
HELP ME FIGURE OUT

41:45.500 --> 41:47.542
HOW EVERYTHING
GOT THIS WAY.

41:52.166 --> 41:54.834
WE CAN GO BACK
TO HATING EACH OTHER
IN THE MORNING.

41:54.834 --> 41:55.834
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.875
I DON'T REALLY HATE YOU,
YOU KNOW.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.500
I DON'T REALLY
HATE YOU EITHER.
