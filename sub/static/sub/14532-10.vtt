WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:05.882
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.048 --> 00:09.177
What did Ghost
really take away from you?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.263
I know that Dre told you
not to hang out with me,

00:11.421 --> 00:13.261
but Dre be talking out
both sides of his mouth.

00:13.286 --> 00:15.809
I see potential in you, my friend.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.100
You could replace me.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.565
- What's this?
- Belongs to Lobos's guy.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.698
Whoever the leak is at your office
was calling him on that phone.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.491
We can't be together, Angie.
It's the right decision.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.834
Greg?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.632
I guess I'm used to people disappearing
in the middle of the night.

00:36.657 --> 00:37.713
I'm right here.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.589
State-of-the-art FBI button recorder.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.748
It's gonna record anything
within a 20-foot radius.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.006
Knox wants to make sure
you're mentioned on the tape.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.591
I cannot be mentioned, not once.

00:45.754 --> 00:49.099
Neither Tommy nor I can be incriminated
in any way, or the deal is off.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.056
Ghost just told me
he's gonna take out Milan.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.686
He's using Ruiz to do it.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.846
I know you had a plan with Ruiz.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.641
Ruiz told me about it,
right before I stabbed him.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.106
Tommy, where's the body?

01:00.269 --> 01:02.271
It's under the fuckin' LIE,
where I left it.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.987
If we're gonna do this,
kill Milan, I call the shots.

Come on, Ruiz,
where the fuck are you?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.051
Shit. Greg Knox.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.729
What? Where?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.817
Sorry, sir, this is
an active police crime scene.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.534
I don't think you have jurisdiction.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.773
Move the fuck away from me.

03:13.935 --> 03:16.015
Hey, it's all right,
it's all right, let him through.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.291
This asshole's the reason we're out here
freezing our ball sacks off.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.122
Ran Ruiz's file.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.524
Said he turned federal witness.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.101
Who the hell
was he gonna snitch out?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.709
Felipe Lobos cartel.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.125
Jesus.
Man, he should've been in WITSEC

03:28.291 --> 03:31.761
shopping for Wranglers
in Bumfuckistan, Nebraska, somewhere.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.719
Yeah, but we were all out of tickets
to Bumfuckistan.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.427
His deal got pulled.
I had to kick him.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.936
WITSEC wasn't an option.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.813
I did officially everything I could do.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.394
You mind?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.854
Be my guest.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.067
Tell you what, you better officially pray
to whatever god you pissed off

03:50.092 --> 03:53.141
this doesn't leak
or you'll never see another Cl again.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.696
Hey, look, you seen enough?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.992
I gotta start cleaning up
your shit show.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.126
Yeah, I think I got all I need.
Thanks.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.540
Feds. Fuckin' idiots.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.986
What do you want, Jamie?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.151
Is there an indictment coming
against me or Tommy

04:36.318 --> 04:37.661
for the murder of Felipe Lobos?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.447
Are you serious?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.334
Something about Ruiz
making up lies about me

04:42.359 --> 04:43.702
to make a deal with your people?

04:43.860 --> 04:46.286
I haven't heard anything
about anything like that.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.205
We had to burn Ruiz
because Lobos died.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.497
He lost his deal.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.784
I don't think anyone's
been in contact with him since.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.561
Why are you asking me this now?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.882
Because I don't trust that you
would tell me, Angela.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.425
You don't trust me?

04:59.591 --> 05:02.094
I'll protect you because
it's in my own best interest.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.354
You can trust that.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.392
I'll ask about Ruiz,
I'll let you know what I find out.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.854
Good-bye, Jamie.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.844
I... habla inglés?

05:45.262 --> 05:49.438
Hi, yeah, this is
FBI Special Agent Gregory Knox.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.945
I wanted to speak with the agent
who gave Miguel Sandoval

05:54.104 --> 05:57.199
a tip of a Felipe Lobos meeting
in Manhattan a little while back.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.735
I just wanted to get
to the source of the information.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.120
Yeah, I think maybe a...

06:02.279 --> 06:04.031
Agent Rivera.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.374
No, I know.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.013
There must be
a million Agent Riveras.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.556
If you could just find out,
get back to me as soon as possible,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.042
that would be...

06:13.498 --> 06:15.500
Yeah, yeah, great,
that's my number.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.214
Bye.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.336
When were you gonna
tell me about Ruiz?

06:41.361 --> 06:43.194
Jerry, I know this looks bad.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.409
I'm in Davis's office defending you,

06:45.572 --> 06:48.200
and then I come to find out
you were already at the crime scene.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.289
I checked my phone,
no call from you.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.250
I went straight there
when I found out.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.532
I... yes, I should've called you.
I... I see that now.

06:54.557 --> 06:57.401
Davis thinks that this is your fault,
and I don't disagree.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.349
Okay, whether or not that
you had to kick Ruiz,

07:04.507 --> 07:07.135
if his murder was a retaliation
to him turning witness,

07:07.302 --> 07:11.227
then your career and mine
is fucked with ten dicks running.

07:11.389 --> 07:15.235
If you've been running Ruiz off the books,
you better have something great.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.396
May be the only thing
that saves us both.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.206
Hey. Hey, man...

07:35.372 --> 07:37.625
yeah, can we meet up
at your place?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.679
Yeah, it's urgent.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.317
So, you don't know
what's on the tape?

07:44.422 --> 07:48.302
Well, I'm not sure, but unless
the recording time ran out,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.687
Tommy killed Ruiz.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.438
Shit, man.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.144
Now we got a conflict of interest.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.479
I'm still Tommy's lawyer.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.362
Proctor, don't give me that shit.
I pay you.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.193
Yeah, but I'm on
the court record for him,

08:00.355 --> 08:02.675
and that tape is evidence
that could help send him to jail,

08:02.700 --> 08:04.322
evidence that you
helped fabricate.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.534
The conversations on that tape,
Proctor, could implicate me

08:08.697 --> 08:11.871
in multiple felonies, so Tommy's
best interest is in my best interest!

08:12.033 --> 08:14.035
Are you even sure Knox
has the device?

08:14.202 --> 08:17.376
I mean, I can't be sure of anything,
and Angela claims,

08:17.539 --> 08:20.713
because I asked her,
to not know of any pending indictment.

08:23.461 --> 08:28.012
You know how I feel about
you trusting AUSA Valdez.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.848
She's your girlfriend, but...

08:32.345 --> 08:34.597
What she is is no longer
my girlfriend anymore, okay?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.083
- She's back with Agent Knox.
- So you fucked that up, too?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.402
You know, maybe you
could just start a group text

08:39.561 --> 08:41.780
to keep us all informed
of your fuck-ups, you know?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.867
Okay.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.452
If that recording surfaces,
I'll get it excluded,

08:50.613 --> 08:52.786
since it's totally illegal, but...

08:52.949 --> 08:55.873
once it's played in open court,
Tommy's eventually

08:56.036 --> 08:57.458
going to jail for doing Ruiz.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.250
The cops, they'll create
the evidence to convict him.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.302
And if you're on there...

09:07.547 --> 09:09.015
you're going down.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.905
You aren't actually
gonna eat that, are you?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.237
Trust me, I've eaten worse.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.867
Now that we're free of Lobos,

09:32.030 --> 09:34.590
I gotta work on everything else
that's been piling up on my desk.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.664
I got about ten witnesses
to prep before court tomorrow.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.714
Speaking of witnesses,
whatever happened to Ruiz?

09:41.873 --> 09:44.171
That was it. No Lobos, no deal.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.133
- I guess none of that matters now.
- What? Why?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.390
What, you didn't hear?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.643
The great Vibora Ruiz

09:53.802 --> 09:56.271
- slithered to the other side overnight.
- What?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.523
Found him in a stolen car
in Long Island City.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.901
No witnesses,
no evidence, nothin'.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.106
Want a bite?

10:06.272 --> 10:08.821
I'm good, thanks.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.280
Just the tip?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.696
You could say "I told you so"
about the Douchebag Twins.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.661
Can I?
Okay, well, I told you so.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.998
I just can't believe that they'd
be selling drugs in their own nightclub.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.004
Aside from that, everything
should be as you remember it.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.042
Mostly everything.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.381
Thank you for your payment in full,
by the way.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.014
Oh, my pleasure.
Sorry about the mix-up before.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.799
Daddy and I are excited
about your party.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.559
- Yeah?
- If everything goes well,

10:34.717 --> 10:37.237
we'll be hosting an event tomorrow
to celebrate our partnership.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.397
I like the sound of that.

10:38.564 --> 10:40.982
And to you two seeing
the best of Truth.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.189
To Truth going global.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.280
I'm glad we partnered up.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.566
So am I.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
Good-bye, Karen.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.247
I don't need an escort. Thanks.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.884
I'm not your escort.
I'm your babysitter.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.672
- He's here.
- I know.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.135
You may leave us.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.314
Go play with the other little boys.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.817
I have some bad news.
We cannot kill Ghost.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.782
Why not? I thought you were
sharpening these for him.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.992
We cannot kill Ghost yet.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.500
We need him for the black tie party
at Truth to be a success,

11:40.658 --> 11:45.334
and once it is and the hotel expansion
contracts with the Bassetts is signed,

11:45.496 --> 11:49.592
then "Ghost" can indeed become
James St. Patrick's rightful name.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.721
If we kill Ghost,
won't the Bassett deal be off the table?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.849
I've observed Karen Bassett's
interactions with Andre.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.509
She has quite a fondness for him.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.224
Yeah, I can't understand why.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.354
I said the same of you once.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.641
Sometimes men can surprise you.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.651
Look at you,
finding your true potential,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.938
while Petar seems
to be losing sight of his.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.108
His sulking has become tiresome.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.744
But regardless, I have no doubt
the deal will still remain in place,

12:16.903 --> 12:19.201
and when the time comes
for Ghost to die,

12:19.364 --> 12:22.117
I want you
to pull the trigger, Tommy.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.176
I understand you have an issue

13:21.342 --> 13:23.182
about the direction
I'm taking my organization.

13:23.207 --> 13:24.645
More like a lack of understanding

13:24.804 --> 13:27.404
of you and this product that you're
trying to move on the streets.

13:27.429 --> 13:28.726
All right, that's Vibora Ruiz.

13:28.888 --> 13:30.351
Late head of Soldados.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.987
Philosophy behind switching
to these other pills, why?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.466
Coke is trying to do us straight.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.199
The fiend is not discerning,
nor is he a loyal customer.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.918
- He will buy...
- That has to be Milan.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.661
That's Milan.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.420
We're all in this
to make money, correct?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.367
So, you put a wire on a Cl
you were running under the table?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.830
No Papers?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.495
Something like that, yeah.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.629
I thought I taught you better than that.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.005
Come on.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.260
You're telling me you guys at Homeland
don't do this shit all the time?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.512
Of course we do,
but when we do it

13:57.670 --> 14:00.970
it's to stop a terrorist from
blowing up the Central Park Zoo.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.011
I came to you because I thought you
out of all people would understand.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.474
I understand you're crazy.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.436
Hey, this is good.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.879
We all one big happy family now?

14:10.904 --> 14:12.693
All right, that's...
That's Tommy Egan.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.149
Who's that?

14:14.312 --> 14:17.361
Business partner of the guy
I was trying to get in the first place,

14:17.523 --> 14:20.993
James St. Patrick.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.043
Greg, are you here?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.389
How did it go with MJ?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.142
I called you, you didn't pick up.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.899
You know what it's like
to be betrayed, Ruiz.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.612
That's what doing Lobos was about.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.175
- It's been a long night.
- Hold on.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.075
- I say we leave it alone?
- Did you hear that?

16:28.100 --> 16:29.914
Me and Ghost
killed Lobos to start over,

16:30.072 --> 16:31.289
but it was never about that.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.050
He just admitted that he
and St. Patrick killed Lobos.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.328
There's nothing
that ties that to St. Patrick.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.792
No one identifies him by name.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.548
If he did it, she did it,
Angela Valdes.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.880
Your ex-girlfriend,
the one with the sister?

16:42.043 --> 16:43.886
- Yeah.
- She's the leak from the department?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.013
She and St. Patrick were together.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.721
If he and Egan knew the route
of the Lobos transfer,

16:48.883 --> 16:50.260
it's because she told them.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.769
You can't prove any of that.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.430
She's not on this tape either.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.676
- Wait, shut up, shut up.
- You're gonna regret this.

16:55.701 --> 16:59.046
No, I won't,
'cause I ain't do this to you. Ghost did.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.491
Egan killed him.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.415
Fucking Christ on the cross,

17:13.574 --> 17:15.917
he killed him.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.221
Admitting to the Lobos kill,
Ruiz's murder?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.053
That's it, baby, that's everything.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.592
I got everything!

17:30.758 --> 17:33.102
You've got nothing.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.684
This recording
doesn't exist, remember?

17:35.846 --> 17:38.895
That is a dying declaration
from Ruiz.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.779
Yeah, from Ruiz, a Cl you were
running unofficially,

17:42.937 --> 17:46.191
put in grave danger,
and got him killed.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.576
Now, you can take
these recordings to court

17:48.734 --> 17:49.974
and try and nail these fuckers,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.992
but you'll get roasted on cross

17:52.154 --> 17:54.953
and you'll end up sucking dick
in prison right next to them.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.414
Unless I can get one of them to flip.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.373
What did I teach you in class?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.172
Who has the most to lose...

18:06.335 --> 18:08.633
and who do I want more?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.732
I'll be pulling up
at Truth in five minutes.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.237
I'll see you on the inside,
Dominique.

18:13.262 --> 18:13.972
All right, boss.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.352
Don't forget we have VIP...

18:15.511 --> 18:17.138
- I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.868
Agent Knox. Good evening.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.877
Would you step
out of the car, please?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.725
I'm clean, man.
I said I'm clean!

18:57.345 --> 18:59.063
Turn.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.770
And forgive me for not taking
your word for it, I'm sorry.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.311
It's just you left quite a few holes
in Felipe Lobos.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.558
Forgive me for not knowing
what you're talking about.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.648
Cut the shit.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.782
I know Tommy Egan killed Ruiz,

19:10.941 --> 19:13.444
and I know the two of you
killed Lobos together.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.613
Didn't do it alone, though, did you?

19:15.780 --> 19:18.374
Angela was your inside man.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.833
Give her up, I'll get you a deal.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.497
If you had anything on me,

19:24.664 --> 19:26.541
I'd be in the back
of your little car by now.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.586
You can threaten me,
you can lie to me, rough me up.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.596
I'm not giving you
a single reason to bring me in.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
All right.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.767
You've got the most to lose
in this situation.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.147
You know that.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.025
You got your family, you got your club,
you got your reputation.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.624
It's all still clean.
There's no real proof that you're dirty.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.414
There's no real proof
that you're Ghost.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.738
- Because I'm not.
- Right, right, right, except Angela.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.744
She knows what you are.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.452
That's why she came back to me,
to pick up the pieces.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.957
That's why she let me in.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.090
She loved you
and you went back to your wife.

20:12.253 --> 20:16.008
If I give her the opportunity,
I'm pretty damn sure

20:16.173 --> 20:19.427
she's gonna burn your ass
like she did me.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.690
If you think Angela is guilty of murder,
you're wrong.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.107
I wonder if she's gonna say
the same thing about you.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.371
Come on, man, come on, come on.

20:58.396 --> 20:59.929
Hey, Mike?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.015
Hey, Mike, can you meet up
at my place right now?

21:02.178 --> 21:04.272
Yeah, we need to talk.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.023
It's about Lobos.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.779
You're late.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.066
Driving while black.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.779
Black man driving a Escalade.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.422
Guy probably thought you was an Uber.

21:18.447 --> 21:20.200
- Was you clean?
- As a whistle.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.114
They ain't see shit, I ain't say shit.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.158
So it ain't shit.

21:24.325 --> 21:29.547
I just met up with Milan.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.083
He's looking to kill you
right after your big-ass party.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.298
He wants that signature from that Karen,
your side bitch.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.008
I told you, I ain't fuckin' her.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.764
- She's just business.
- Yeah, whatever.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.963
Once she signs that contract,
he gonna take you out.

21:40.988 --> 21:42.476
Somethin' about she likes Dre?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.262
That's true, she does.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.805
Well, that's crazy.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.865
We gonna have to move during that party
while his guard is down.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.570
Yeah, but I don't know
how can manage that.

21:49.695 --> 21:51.976
Karen's gonna be there, her father,
all... all the guests.

21:52.001 --> 21:55.828
Well, you better fuckin' figure it out,
'cause we ain't gonna get a better shot.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.203
Thanks.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.544
What's going on? You sounded
pretty worked up on the phone.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.549
Angela's the leak.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.757
I know it, but I can't prove it.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.683
- Start at the beginning.
- Right, okay...

22:23.676 --> 22:25.599
I got a piece of evidence.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.388
It's not gonna be admissible, though.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.739
L-I drew a little bit
outside of the lines to...

22:28.764 --> 22:30.241
It's not gonna be admissible,
then it doesn't count.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.064
I know, yeah, just listen, okay?

22:32.226 --> 22:35.526
I can link her
to the Lobos murder plot.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.237
I fuckin' knew it all along,
and no one fuckin' believed me,

22:38.399 --> 22:41.744
and that's fine, but if...

22:41.902 --> 22:43.622
Shit, let me get rid of this.
One sec, okay?

22:43.647 --> 22:45.949
Sorry. One... one sec.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.492
Hello?

22:47.658 --> 22:49.035
Is this Agent Gregory Knox?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.361
This is the Mexican Federal Police
returning your call.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.460
Listen, just forget I called.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.822
- It's not...
- Well, actually,

22:54.874 --> 22:57.548
we can't seem to find any record
of a tip being made recently

22:57.710 --> 23:01.510
to Miguel Sandoval in regard
to Felipe Lobos's whereabouts.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.802
The Agent Rivera in that
department died a year ago.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.596
That's all the information
we have at this time.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.935
Okay, thank you.
Appreciate your call.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.148
Everything all right?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.618
Yeah, of course.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.403
Where was I?

23:24.570 --> 23:27.039
- Angela's the leak.
- Right.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.165
Yeah.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.577
She's the leak.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.103
Beer?
You want a beer or something?

23:32.128 --> 23:33.249
- You good?
- Sure.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.914
Yeah? Okay.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.254
According to the Federals,

23:41.420 --> 23:44.390
Lobos plans to meet with
his distributor Tommy Egan

23:44.548 --> 23:46.346
at a warehouse on 11th Avenue.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.908
The last thing our department needs

23:47.933 --> 23:50.152
is a wild, unformulated accusation
about a leak.

23:57.728 --> 24:01.483
I have to tell you,
I suspected Angela all along.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.617
She has access to everything.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.284
That's what I been saying.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.298
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.004
Cheers.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.466
Yeah, it's just...

24:26.632 --> 24:29.181
yeah.

24:29.343 --> 24:32.096
It's just the GPS tracker on Lobos...

24:32.262 --> 24:35.516
She obviously
told the assailants where to find it.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.163
You said you saw them
go right for it.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.529
Well, they did, except she wasn't
in your office when we discussed it.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.361
It was just...

24:42.523 --> 24:45.618
Anglin, Donovan, me, and you.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.325
Who was that on the phone, Greg?

24:55.119 --> 24:56.336
Federals.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.874
You know that tip you got about
the meeting where we arrested Lobos?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.960
Never happened, Mike.
They've never heard of you.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.218
They're disorganized.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.974
I saw you outside
Hugo Sanchez's building.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.514
I was trying to solve this case.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.398
You were covering
your tracks, weren't you?

25:16.557 --> 25:17.934
Agents are dead.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.853
I almost fucking died
because of you.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.496
They threatened my family.
I had no choice.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.156
We always have a choice.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.037
Look, Greg...

25:39.997 --> 25:42.591
Angela's dirty.
You know it and I know it.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.674
St. Patrick, Egan, the sketch,

25:45.836 --> 25:48.806
what she did to your career.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.600
She should already be in prison.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.431
- If we can offer her to MJ...
- You mean frame her.

25:57.598 --> 26:00.021
If we take her down as the leak,
we could finally collar

26:00.184 --> 26:03.814
St. Patrick and Egan
as Lobos's distributors.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.105
It's what you said.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.752
If Angela's the leak, it means
you were right about everything.

26:07.777 --> 26:10.448
The allegations she made against you,
everyone who doubted you

26:10.611 --> 26:13.865
and said that you were crazy,
it all goes away.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.157
You're a hero.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.672
You said you have
a piece of evidence?

26:21.830 --> 26:22.956
We can use it.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.468
I'll get around the admissibility problem,
whatever it is.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.801
We can make this work.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.596
You're right, she's dirty.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.184
But on this one she's clean.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.070
I'm so sorry, Mike.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.573
I gotta take you in.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.528
Hey, Mike, hey, hey, hey,
take it easy.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.129
It's fine. Just put the gun down,
we'll talk about it.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.828
- I can't do that, Greg.
- I'm gonna help you, all right?

26:56.950 --> 26:58.470
We're gonna...
You're gonna get a deal.

26:58.495 --> 26:59.500
You're a good guy.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.253
L just need you to put the gun down.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.210
If you pull that trigger,
it means you're no better than Lobos.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.501
If you pull that trigger,
it means one day

27:06.667 --> 27:07.907
your beautiful little daughter,

27:08.001 --> 27:10.720
she's gonna know
that her daddy's a murderer.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.737
Saxe.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.698
Oh, God, they called you, too.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.158
Who called me?
What are you talking about?

28:59.321 --> 29:01.119
Jerry, what's going on?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.249
Bad day, Angela. I'm sorry.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.877
- You shouldn't go in there.
- Oh, my God.

29:06.036 --> 29:07.663
What?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.296
Watch your back.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.587
I don't understand.
What happened to Greg?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.676
I don't understand.
What happened?

29:16.838 --> 29:19.216
I...

29:19.383 --> 29:20.760
Wh...

29:20.926 --> 29:22.644
It's like with girls.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.851
No just mean "Not right now."

29:25.013 --> 29:28.233
It's like, say you talk to a girl
and she tell you no.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.020
Then later you come back around,
you talk to her again,

29:31.186 --> 29:33.029
she remember that first time
she told you no.

29:33.188 --> 29:36.237
So she say, "You been liking me
for all of this time."

29:36.400 --> 29:38.198
Maybe now I give him some booty.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.738
- Word?
- That's the way it is.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.872
What happened to your hand?

29:47.494 --> 29:49.167
That's a long story.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.667
L-I should get to school.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.381
Told my mom I was with Calvin.

29:55.544 --> 29:56.796
Nah, nah.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.057
I need you to take this
to my man Ray Ray.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.058
Give to him and bring back
what he gives you.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.105
- What is it?
- Never mind.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.836
I'll do it my fuckin' self, man.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.171
I thought you knew better
than to ask some shit like that.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.110
It's all right.
You just ain't ready.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.615
No, no. I'm gonna do it.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.324
Where's Ray Ray at?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.372
Why'd you come in
so late last night?

30:30.203 --> 30:31.420
Went to see Angela?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.549
Angela and I
ain't talkin' much these days.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.174
But I did see Tommy.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.436
He killed Ruiz
for being a traitor to Milan.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.558
Did Tommy
say how he figured that out?

30:50.724 --> 30:52.644
He said Ruiz told him
right before he killed him.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.733
He knew that was my only way out
and he shut it down!

30:55.896 --> 30:57.739
Well, Tommy
doesn't want you to get out.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.902
Trust me, I know it, but I thought
at a base level we were back on point,

31:01.068 --> 31:02.548
I mean, after I helped
him with Holly.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.410
You know, I mean,
after everything we been through.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.826
Tommy is changing,
and I don't think it's for the better.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.994
Help him with Holly? Like how?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.857
I'm gonna go make sure that Raina
remembers her tap things.

31:14.882 --> 31:16.959
Baby girl,
you got them loud shoes?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.593
I can't find them.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.425
You lose 'em every week, Raina.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.407
Said you wanted to talk.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.116
I came unarmed.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.782
Now, we both know that's bullshit.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.004
If you think you can kill me
and get away with it,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.514
then, Tommy, you are
more stupid than I thought.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.722
If I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be talking.

32:14.683 --> 32:17.186
Let me ask you something.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.512
How'd it feel the other day
when Milan cock-slapped you

32:19.537 --> 32:21.380
in front of the entire
Belgrade social club?

32:22.482 --> 32:25.611
How does it feel to know that
after everything you've done for him,

32:25.777 --> 32:28.496
he shows me love over you?

32:31.074 --> 32:32.747
That's what I thought.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.879
Look, I got a plan that'll make us
both rich and happy,

32:36.037 --> 32:39.416
but it means that I gotta trust you
and you gotta trust me.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.840
Are you down?

32:59.644 --> 33:04.275
We'd like to have a word with you all
about the late Agent Greg Knox.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.785
We found a burner cell
in Knox's apartment,

33:06.943 --> 33:08.536
not attached to
any case he was working.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.995
It's the phone that called Lobos
the day he went missing.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.457
It's the phone that belonged
to someone in this office

33:15.619 --> 33:17.087
that leaked Lobos's location.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.671
Add that to his obsession
with the case, luring Ruiz back,

33:21.833 --> 33:23.301
even while under suspension.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.589
Looks like Greg Knox
was your leak.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.348
- No.
- No way.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.680
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I don't believe that.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.515
It doesn't matter what you believe.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.351
There was a leak in your office
right under your nose.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.484
You and Donovan over here
should both lose your job.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.736
Knox's killer was probably
a Lobos associate

33:40.894 --> 33:43.864
tying up loose ends,
and there was no forced entry,

33:44.022 --> 33:46.775
so unless he left the window open,
he knew his killer and let him in.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.535
Greg never left his windows unlocked.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.819
Well, you would know.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.988
I can assure you that
no one in this office

33:52.155 --> 33:53.657
suspected Knox of
any wrongdoing.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.827
At least his murder saves us
the cost of his prosecution.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.746
This case is closed.

33:59.913 --> 34:03.884
Come on, Lance,
we got a Delta shuttle to catch.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.886
Sorry for your loss,
AUSA Valdez.

34:07.045 --> 34:11.766
That phone wasn't the only piece of
random evidence at Knox's apartment.

34:11.925 --> 34:15.304
There was a dress
and a bracelet, a bra.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.306
You two were back together?

34:18.473 --> 34:19.895
Briefly.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.231
After everything
you put him through?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.817
I guess he just couldn't shake ya.

34:24.980 --> 34:29.110
It's amazing what a man'll do
for ya if he really loves you.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.074
Good luck, girl.
You're gonna need it.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.065
Tash, you okay?
What's this big emergency?

35:00.223 --> 35:02.271
The big emergency
is you killed Ruiz.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.186
Ghost came to me this morning

35:04.352 --> 35:06.229
wondering why you stopped
his plan to get out.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.569
He cannot know
that I told you, Tommy.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.932
He's not gonna know that you
said nothing. It's handled.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.227
You know, he's not wrong
about getting away from Milan.

35:13.361 --> 35:17.787
Listen, Tash, I got a plan to get us
all out from under Milan.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.624
You sound just like Ghost now.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.211
He's always got a plan.
It's always about trusting him.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.467
Yeah? Well, trust me.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.630
We all play our parts right,
everyone will get what they want,

35:30.795 --> 35:35.767
as long as Milan
and Ghost stay in the dark.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.019
I am trusting you, Tommy.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.476
Ghost can be a lying,
sometime-y motherfucker,

35:40.639 --> 35:43.734
but he is still the father of my kids,

35:43.892 --> 35:46.862
and I need to protect him,
even from himself.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.068
I'm protecting him, too.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.070
I always do.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.539
This morning Ghost
said something about helping you...

36:01.701 --> 36:03.578
with Holly.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.294
What does he mean, Tommy?

36:06.456 --> 36:09.050
Holly? Nothing.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.177
Nothing happened, T.
Stick to the plan.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.063
You've got to be kidding me.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.574
Why did we have to meet here?

36:32.732 --> 36:35.326
Well, Angie, I was
in the neighborhood, and...

36:35.485 --> 36:37.203
you always liked the fries.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.211
What did you do last night, Jamie?

36:45.370 --> 36:48.210
I thought we weren't supposed to
ask each other those kind of questions.

36:48.235 --> 36:50.613
What did you do last night?

36:52.919 --> 36:55.297
I went to work, the club.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.682
Did you have a nice night
with Agent Knox?

36:59.092 --> 37:00.890
I didn't see him last night.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.521
Well, I did. He pulled me over.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.604
He didn't tell you?

37:06.766 --> 37:10.111
He came out accusing me of killing
Lobos, which I told you he would do.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.647
What did you tell him?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.486
I told him he had no proof, Angie.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.525
That if he had proof,
he would've arrested me.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.612
He tried to get me to say
that you were the leak.

37:17.637 --> 37:18.828
I told him you were innocent.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.455
Oh, my God.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.253
So does that mean
that you now believe me?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.669
I don't know what to believe.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.332
Angie, I told you that I needed
to protect you from Greg.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.168
I'd do anything to protect you.

37:39.924 --> 37:44.680
I agreed to meet with you
because the leak case was closed.

37:44.846 --> 37:49.192
They found that person,
so I'm in the clear.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.229
And you and me, we're done.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.318
Angie, that's a lie.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.738
You still love me and I still love you.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.952
Good-bye, Jamie.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.976
Yo, you Ray Ray, right?

38:27.972 --> 38:29.269
Here, I got this for you.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.434
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not here, man.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.729
Get yo' ass in there,
nigga, come on.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.612
All right, nigga,
you got my shit?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.321
Yeah.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.245
That's nice.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.673
All right, hands against the wall.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.551
- What?
- I said grab some wall!

38:56.709 --> 38:58.586
You have the right to remain silent.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.847
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.645
A'ight.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.611
Tariq St. Patrick.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.150
Handed me these.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.911
Where'd you get these?

39:29.409 --> 39:31.537
These babies will put you
in juvenile detention

39:31.703 --> 39:33.171
till your 18th birthday,

39:33.329 --> 39:36.959
which I'm guessin' is gonna take
several long years for you,

39:37.125 --> 39:41.005
so you want to do yourself a favor
and tell me who gave you that shit?

39:42.255 --> 39:44.508
You know rich,
little mark-ass bitches like you,

39:44.674 --> 39:46.267
they fresh meat up in Spofford.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.555
You so fuckin' soft,
they gon' call you Ta-fleece.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.190
You sure as shit
ain't no hustler, nigga.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.396
Think about all the trouble
you're gonna get in...

39:54.559 --> 39:57.438
The law, school, your parents.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.322
I know you don't want all of that,

39:59.480 --> 40:02.905
so I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

40:03.067 --> 40:07.618
Tell me who gave you these guns.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.122
Speak, nigga!

40:13.202 --> 40:14.704
Okay.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.373
We're going in.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.215
Your boy held tough.
He didn't say shit.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.559
See, now, that's how you handle shit,
like a G.

40:28.718 --> 40:32.097
Yeah.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.856
Little man a'ight.

42:21.748 --> 42:22.920
You okay, Valdes?

42:25.168 --> 42:27.466
No.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.847
In fact, I don't know how...

42:30.006 --> 42:32.100
I'm going to be okay.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.056
You?

42:34.218 --> 42:36.562
I thought I knew Greg, you know?

42:38.014 --> 42:40.938
He was such a true believer.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.362
Hard to believe he was dirty.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.240
And the fact that
we'll probably never catch

42:46.355 --> 42:49.199
the guy who killed him
is pretty hard to take.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.907
Yeah...

42:52.070 --> 42:54.243
too hard to take.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.662
Listen.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.919
If you don't want to
go home alone tonight...

43:02.914 --> 43:06.794
Sometimes grief
does strange things to people.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.757
Not that strange.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.180
I'm here if you change your mind.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.113
♪ But where I'm from ♪

43:35.279 --> 43:36.719
♪ It ain't hard to pull the strap ♪

43:36.781 --> 43:39.660
♪ 'Cause if a nigga want some,
I got some ♪

43:39.826 --> 43:41.624
♪ And I'ma serve the gas
till they done ♪

43:41.786 --> 43:43.163
♪ So... ♪

43:43.329 --> 43:45.582
For real, you shoulda
seen your face.

43:45.748 --> 43:46.920
"Hands on the wall!"

43:49.085 --> 43:50.928
- Yeah, whatever.
- No whatever, nigga.

43:51.087 --> 43:53.607
You turned white so fast,
Michael Jackson would've been jealous.

43:59.345 --> 44:01.268
You not from
this neighborhood, are you?

44:01.430 --> 44:03.432
Nah, I'm from the city.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.443
Not that it matters anymore.
I don't never wanna go back there.

44:06.602 --> 44:10.357
My family just...
They just all fake, they're all liars.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.242
I don't want shit from them anymore,
I can get my own stuff.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.654
- My dad can keep his money.
- No doubt.

44:15.820 --> 44:20.246
Not that it makes a damn difference,
but if you had to guess...

44:20.408 --> 44:22.706
how much money
would you say your pops is worth?

44:24.662 --> 44:27.461
- I don't know, a lot?
- A lot?

44:27.623 --> 44:30.627
What you got, Alfred answering
the front door or some shit?

44:30.793 --> 44:33.046
No, we don't got a front door.
We got a elevator.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.480
You got a elevator?

44:42.638 --> 44:44.436
Juke, you got a minute?

44:49.228 --> 44:50.354
I told you he was ready.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.881
Yeah, he held up, but why you
lookin' like you about to lift

44:53.047 --> 44:55.527
that little nigga in the air
like "The Lion King" or some shit?

44:55.591 --> 44:57.157
Don't get attached.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.743
Why you ain't tell me
Ghost is ballin' now?

44:59.906 --> 45:02.534
Not just drug money,
nightclubs and shit.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.374
- That just slip your mind?
- What difference does it make anyway?

45:05.536 --> 45:08.039
So...

45:08.206 --> 45:10.379
you got a rich man's kid
in your place.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.594
You just ain't gonna do shit with it?

45:13.753 --> 45:16.473
I was gonna use him to fuck
with the parents of his rich-ass friends,

45:16.631 --> 45:18.599
break into their apartments and shit.

45:18.758 --> 45:21.039
I already turnt him out.
He gonna be down with the hustle.

45:21.064 --> 45:23.266
Yo, fuck that. He is the hustle.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.147
Ransom his ass.

45:25.306 --> 45:26.946
You can get the money
and kill him anyway.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.654
You are still plannin'
on killin' him, right?

45:31.812 --> 45:33.564
The point was to break his father.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.828
This way you break him twice.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.830
Once in the pocket, once in the heart.

45:43.658 --> 45:45.877
You get Ghost's money,
kill his kid,

45:46.035 --> 45:48.083
you ride off into the sunset.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.998
Flawless fuckin' victory.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.377
Right?

45:58.256 --> 46:00.384
Right.

46:16.524 --> 46:18.652
I have to hand it to you.

46:18.818 --> 46:20.578
I'm quite confident,
by the end of the night,

46:20.603 --> 46:21.980
Karen, I will earn
our partnership.

46:22.147 --> 46:24.116
- No handouts here.
- I hope you're right.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.784
He's right, Daddy, he's right.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.998
Come on, let's take a walk.
Welcome to the party.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.017
Okay, nigga, we here, on time,

46:44.176 --> 46:46.178
in these fuckin' monkey suits.
What's up?

46:46.345 --> 46:47.655
All right, listen, we do it
like we talked about, a'ight?

46:47.680 --> 46:49.040
- A'ight.
- Kush as smooth as silk.

46:49.098 --> 46:50.566
- No hood shit.
- Bet.

46:53.519 --> 46:56.193
Yo, nothin' pops off in this club,
y'all hear me?

46:56.355 --> 46:58.195
- Got it.
- Got a lot of rich white people here

46:58.220 --> 46:59.860
- that ain't afraid to call 911.
- Got it.

46:59.889 --> 47:00.860
So don't get jumpy-

47:02.695 --> 47:04.493
I heard you, motherfucker,
we good.

47:05.698 --> 47:07.575
- Let's get money.
- Let's get it.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.710
Man of the hour,
Mr. Rashad Jennings.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.216
James, how you doing?

47:15.374 --> 47:17.054
Good, man, everything
to your expectations?

47:17.079 --> 47:18.465
Oh, man,
this is above and beyond.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.095
Let me let that add to your night.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.006
Only the best for the best.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.220
Yeah!

47:23.382 --> 47:25.476
Hey, man, you really
turned up the place tonight.

47:25.634 --> 47:27.557
Let me tell the bartender
what to do for you.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.481
You make sure you take care
of this man and all his people, all right?

47:30.506 --> 47:32.346
When that's dead,
I got a whole crate upstairs.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.610
- Mr. St. Patrick.
- Mr. Bassett.

47:34.769 --> 47:37.363
We feel you are right.

47:37.521 --> 47:38.818
You have earned it.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.365
Sir.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.801
- We'll get right to work.
- I can't wait.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.381
- To us.
- To us.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.888
Oh, Tasha.
Good to see you again.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.597
What the fuck
are you doing here?

48:07.760 --> 48:10.388
You know,
now it's our club, too.

48:20.022 --> 48:22.616
Now that the paperwork is signed,
we have to talk.

48:22.775 --> 48:23.834

48:45.256 --> 48:48.681
No, I have you now.
Do exactly as I say.

48:48.843 --> 48:51.016
Whatever your foolish plan is,
it won't work.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.431
This time it was you

49:49.487 --> 49:51.785
Get in the back, Chefe.

50:03.876 --> 50:06.504
Stop.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.047
Right there.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.725
So, this is it?

50:15.888 --> 50:17.936
This is your revenge?

50:18.098 --> 50:20.271
- It's not personal, Milan.
- Just business.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.357
I underestimated you.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.022
Nah, you underestimated us.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.828
We could've killed you
in the club, Milan.

50:25.853 --> 50:28.067
We wanted you to know
that we outsmarted you this time,

50:28.234 --> 50:30.987
so you die here.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.906
- You learned.
- Nighty night, Milan.

50:34.073 --> 50:37.077
Rest easy.
I ain't gonna eat you.

50:47.503 --> 50:48.880
That worked, partner.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.764
Yeah, just like we thought it would.

50:50.923 --> 50:53.597
If I'm gonna be the connect,
gotta get rid of the connect.

50:53.759 --> 50:54.851
- Right?
- Right.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.226
You were right, Ghost.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.858
Gettin' rid of Milan
gives us both everything we want.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.984
It's over.

51:05.938 --> 51:08.157
It's over.

51:08.315 --> 51:10.235
All right, then I'ma
get back to work, all right?

51:10.260 --> 51:11.569
I got a club to run.

51:11.735 --> 51:15.035
You watch your back.

51:15.197 --> 51:16.824
You too, motherfuck.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.957
Just spoke to Dre.
The men all played their parts.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.718
Everyone's safe and sound
and drinking beers.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.173
We should go.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.680
We have to get the men started
on moving to new warehouse.

51:31.839 --> 51:34.558
- Yeah.
- I'll give the order.

51:38.178 --> 51:41.148
Did you tell Ghost we're still going
to sell drugs in his clubs?

51:41.307 --> 51:43.901
Nah, he'll know soon enough.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.938
Think he'll agree to that?

51:47.104 --> 51:49.027
I won't give him a choice.

51:56.155 --> 51:57.327
Hey, Morn.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.623
Don't "Hey, Mom" me.
You should be in bed.

52:01.785 --> 52:04.584
Where's Dad?
I thought he was coming home with you.

52:04.747 --> 52:07.045
Yeah, well, he had to handle
some business,

52:07.207 --> 52:08.167
but he'll be home later.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.886
Come here.

52:11.045 --> 52:12.046
It's okay.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.259
Where's your brother?

52:13.422 --> 52:16.266
He went to hang out
with that new friend of his, Slim.

52:16.425 --> 52:19.053
Slim? Who's Slim?

52:19.219 --> 52:21.221
He said he was a friend
of Dre's and Shawn.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.891
He knew Dad and Uncle Tommy
when they were younger.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.548
Let me try to call your brother.

52:27.573 --> 52:28.900
I tried that. He didn't pick up.

52:29.063 --> 52:31.316
Yeah, well, he better pick up for me.

52:34.068 --> 52:37.572
Son. Bustin' your ass!

52:37.738 --> 52:39.740
Yo, hold on.

52:39.907 --> 52:41.227
You better pause the game, nigga.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.285
L think I should go home.

52:43.452 --> 52:46.422
I don't want to but my mom
gonna be looking for me.

52:51.877 --> 52:54.505
The last bottle of lean was crazy.

52:54.672 --> 52:55.969
I feel different.

52:56.131 --> 52:58.179
Yeah, we mix it different in D.C.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.159
No time like the present,
motherfucker.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.450
We doing this shit or not?

53:44.471 --> 53:45.939
Send it.

53:46.098 --> 53:47.850
What's his mom
gon' think when she see that?

53:48.016 --> 53:50.485
She gon' think I'm back
from the dead, baby.

54:08.287 --> 54:09.539
What's wrong?

54:11.457 --> 54:13.175
Morn?

54:13.333 --> 54:15.677
- Mom?
- Nothing.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.133
Just... just go to your room.

54:17.296 --> 54:18.969
L-I gotta call your father.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.271
Hey, were you been?
I lost you for a second.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.933
Just busy keeping
the guests happy.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.316
Well, I'm happy-

54:30.476 --> 54:32.729
Karen and I were talking.

54:32.895 --> 54:34.522
What do you think of Dubai?

54:34.688 --> 54:36.565
Take my jet.

54:36.732 --> 54:39.485
- Does next week work?
- Absolutely.

54:44.990 --> 54:47.084
Excuse me.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.600
I never meant
to hurt you, Angie, okay?

55:03.759 --> 55:05.306
I had a reason for everything I did.

55:06.845 --> 55:08.597
That doesn't matter now.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.858
Of course it matters.
Our love matters.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.859
Now we can be together.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.817
No, we can't.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.783
Angie, what the hell?

55:19.942 --> 55:21.990
James St. Patrick,

55:22.152 --> 55:26.077
you are under arrest for the murder
of Special Agent Gregory Knox.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.460
Greg's dead?
I-l didn't kill Greg.

55:29.618 --> 55:31.541
You have the right
to remain silent.

55:31.703 --> 55:33.296
Angie, you gotta believe me.
Angie!

55:33.455 --> 55:35.503
Anything you do or say
can and will be

55:35.666 --> 55:37.088
used against you in a court of law.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.878
Angela, why are you doing this?

55:39.044 --> 55:40.466
Why did you do this?

55:40.629 --> 55:41.630
I loved you.

55:41.797 --> 55:43.595
All right, got it.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.851
Yo, get your hands off.
Who the fuck are you, man?

55:46.009 --> 55:48.182
You have the right to an attorney.

55:48.345 --> 55:51.224
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.

55:51.390 --> 55:53.910
Do you understand these rights
as they've been explained to you?

55:53.935 --> 55:56.404
