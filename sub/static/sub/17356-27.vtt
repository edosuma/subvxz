00:07.041 --> 00:09.541
- Kids,
your dad's cooking breakfast.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.010
Get excited!

00:11.012 --> 00:11.944
- What is it, Dad?

00:11.946 --> 00:13.445
French toast? Pancakes?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.948
- Ooh, even better.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.018
- Cereal?

00:19.020 --> 00:21.053
- I'm going back to bed.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.388
- [electronic beeping]

00:22.390 --> 00:23.355
- FEMALE COMPUTER:
Alert, alert!

00:23.357 --> 00:27.292
Incoming transmission
from Super President Kickbutt.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.160
- Hello, Thundermans.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.596
Where are those
amazing superheroes of ours?

00:30.598 --> 00:33.932
- What can Nora and I
do for you, Your Highness?

00:36.437 --> 00:37.136
- Morning, guys.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.171
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
Ah, there they are.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.406
- Super President Kickbutt.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.042
- Oh, what up, Kicky?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.943
- I'm calling
to congratulate you two

00:44.945 --> 00:48.147
on stopping that
exploding Porta-Potty yesterday.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.216
- Trust me,
the pleasure was not ours.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.886
- It was your 99th save
as a team.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.588
Which means
you're just one away from 100.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.257
- Ooh! No way!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.926
Pretty amazing, considering
we can't stand each other.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.162
- [whispers]
Not in front of, Kicky.

01:03.397 --> 01:07.366
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for my surfing lesson.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.368
Super President Kickbutt...

01:09.370 --> 01:11.336
cowabunga!

01:11.338 --> 01:11.770
- ¶

01:11.772 --> 01:15.474
- Ah, congrats, you two,
on your 99th save!

01:15.476 --> 01:18.110
You're just one away
from your 100th.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.578
- Uh, I remember our 100th.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.213
Or as we like to call it...

01:21.215 --> 01:23.082
- BOTH: The Thundredth.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.349
- We took down
Professor Meteor,

01:24.351 --> 01:26.518
one of the most evil villains
in all of Metroburg.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.055
- Yeah, it was so epic,
they made a movie about it.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.156
- Mm-hmm.

01:31.158 --> 01:34.093
- ¶

01:34.095 --> 01:37.062
- You'll never stop my meteor
from destroying the world!

01:37.064 --> 01:38.630
- We'll see about that.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.433
- BOTH: [grunting]

01:41.435 --> 01:42.935
- Hit his helmet, Electress.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.203
It'll take out his power.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.270
- But I might hit you.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.506
- Uh! You already did.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.674
- ¶

01:48.676 --> 01:50.342
- Right in the heart.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.510
Ah!

01:51.512 --> 01:54.279
- ¶

01:54.281 --> 01:55.514
- Light 'em up!

01:55.516 --> 01:57.649
- [electricity zapping]

01:57.651 --> 02:01.186
- ¶

02:01.188 --> 02:02.988
- Nice shot, sugar.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.257
- I think you mean nice shock.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.392
- I'll have my rev--uh!

02:07.394 --> 02:12.531
- ¶

02:12.533 --> 02:15.300
- BOTH: Ew!

02:15.302 --> 02:16.201
- On it.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.703
- Whoa!

02:17.705 --> 02:19.972
- Phoebe, do you realize
what this means?

02:19.974 --> 02:22.241
- Our parents are gross?
- Yes.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.443
And when we make
that 100th save--

02:24.445 --> 02:25.444
- We're gonna have a movie!

02:25.446 --> 02:27.079
- [scoffs]
- I don't know, guys.

02:27.081 --> 02:28.080
We were pretty legendary.

02:28.082 --> 02:32.251
- Let's get that 100th save!
- We're gonna have a movie!

02:32.253 --> 02:37.589
- ¶

02:37.591 --> 02:39.424
- Hey, guys.
Watching our movie?

02:39.426 --> 02:42.027
- No, we're watching
something good.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.663
It's Chloe's favorite TV show,
"The Wonder Fluppies."

02:44.665 --> 02:46.231
- It's good if you're six.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.499
- You made us watch it twice.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.036
- 'Cause I'm 13.
Do the math.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.072
- It's just one of those shows
that are trying to sell you

02:54.074 --> 02:55.140
toys and ice cream.

02:55.142 --> 02:55.774
- No, it's not.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.710
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Hey, kids,
do you like toys and ice cream?

02:58.712 --> 02:59.378
- ALL: Yes!

02:59.380 --> 03:01.446
- ANNOUNCER: Then you'll love
Scoop Du Jour's ginormous,

03:01.448 --> 03:04.049
super scoop
ice cream drone sundae.

03:04.051 --> 03:04.683
- ALL: Oooh!

03:04.685 --> 03:06.385
- ANNOUNCER:
Delivered straight to your door

03:06.387 --> 03:08.520
by a super cool flying drone.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.622
Available
for a limited time only.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.623
- Awesome!

03:11.625 --> 03:12.457
- Can we get one?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.226
- You bet
your hot fudge we can.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.761
Eating ice cream
from a flying robot

03:15.763 --> 03:18.297
will make a fantastic
family memory.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.064
- Couldn't agree more.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.533
It's moments like that
why we had four kids.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.669
- Five.
- Five kids.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.538
- Then it's settled,
we're getting that sundae!

03:26.540 --> 03:27.539
- KIDS: Yeah!

03:27.541 --> 03:28.607
- Just not today.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.342
- KIDS: Yeah!

03:30.344 --> 03:31.476
What?

03:31.478 --> 03:32.211
- Kids, we told you.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.180
Your dad and I are going to
Metroburg Theater to see a play.

03:35.182 --> 03:39.284
I got us front row seats
to "Annie Get Your Ray Gun."

03:39.286 --> 03:40.252
Take notes, kids.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.521
This is how you husband.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.289
- You'll enjoy
that sundae even more

03:44.291 --> 03:46.458
when we can
all share it together.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.794
I promise.
- Be good, kids!

03:49.597 --> 03:51.230
- Okay, bye.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.731
So we're ordering
that sundae, right?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.333
- Already ordered it.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.669
- But Mommy and Daddy said
to wait so we can make memories.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.439
- The commercial said
it's for a limited time only.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.241
That means
that they might run out.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.576
- Oh, you did the right thing.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.446
- Yeah, you did.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.513
- No one asked you.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.149
- And no one asked your face!

04:11.151 --> 04:11.617
Any who,

04:11.619 --> 04:14.553
call me when the ice cream
gets here, Snack Pals.

04:15.656 --> 04:20.259
- ¶

04:20.261 --> 04:23.195
- Well, that was the most
embarrassing save attempt ever.

04:23.197 --> 04:24.830
You tackled Mr. Fuscarelio.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.765
- I thought he was a wolf man.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.434
- You know
he's just super hairy.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.771
- Two root beers, please.
- Thanks.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.673
Alright, so we didn't get
our Thundredth save yet,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.742
but it's just a matter of time
before we do.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.577
- And they make
a movie about me.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.146
Max Thunderman is Max Thunderman

04:41.148 --> 04:43.749
in "The Max Thunderman Movie."

04:45.185 --> 04:46.718
- What about me?
Do I get to play myself?

04:46.720 --> 04:51.256
- Nope, 'cause it's rated PG
for Phoebe's Gross.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.392
- Uh, that's funny
since I'm gonna carry

04:53.394 --> 04:54.159
all the musical numbers.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.262
- Ew, it is not a musical.
- Why can't it be a musical?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.130
- 'Cause musicals are dumb.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.798
People singing and dancing.
- Here's a car,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.533
let's blow it up for no reason!

05:01.535 --> 05:04.269
- Hey! Get back here!

05:04.271 --> 05:06.738
Somebody help! Anybody!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.840
- What's "wong," Mrs. "Wrong"?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.477
I'm sorry, I know,
just tell me what happened.

05:12.479 --> 05:16.415
- That guy ran out without
paying for his soda refill.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.816
- His refill?
Aren't they free?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.585
- [scoffs] The only thing free
in this place

05:20.587 --> 05:23.288
are the insults, dummy.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.389
Somebody do something!

05:24.391 --> 05:26.391
- Don't worry, we'll help you.
Come on, Max.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.626
- Phoebe, what are you doing?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.927
- Following the Superhero Code.

05:28.929 --> 05:33.865
If you hear a citizen scream,
you must intervene.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.901
- Oh. I thought it was...

05:35.903 --> 05:37.836
stop being a nerd!

05:37.838 --> 05:39.771
Do you really want
our movie to be about

05:39.773 --> 05:42.441
us catching the Soda Stealer?

05:45.713 --> 05:46.611
- [grunting]

05:46.613 --> 05:49.614
- Who do you think you are
stealing 27 cents worth

05:49.616 --> 05:51.249
of generic cola product?

05:51.251 --> 05:52.584
- Try and stop me.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.453
- I will. But first...

05:54.455 --> 05:56.188
super flips.

05:56.190 --> 06:00.759
- ¶

06:01.362 --> 06:02.060
- What is she doing?

06:02.062 --> 06:04.363
- Trying to make this movie
interesting.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.797
- ¶

06:05.799 --> 06:08.467
- That's the last straw,
Soda Stealer.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.472
- [gasps]
Thank you, Thunder Twins.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.406
- Ow, ow, ow.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.875
- Don't thank us.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.643
Thank me.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.679
- ¶

06:20.681 --> 06:22.781
- Ah!
- Yes.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.450
- Now, doesn't that sound lame?

06:25.452 --> 06:25.951
- Yeah.

06:25.953 --> 06:29.488
'Cause it's supposed to be
a musical with me as the star.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.225
- ¶

06:33.227 --> 06:35.293
¶ Hey, stop,
put down that pop ¶

06:35.295 --> 06:36.928
¶ You owe her some money ¶

06:36.930 --> 06:39.331
¶ Refills here
are not for free ¶

06:39.333 --> 06:40.665
¶ Don't try to be funny ¶

06:40.667 --> 06:44.636
¶ Your crime didn't pay,
you wasted your morning ¶

06:44.638 --> 06:48.940
¶ But if you comply,
you'll get off with a warning ¶

06:48.942 --> 06:51.543
- ¶ You'll get off
with a warning ¶

06:51.545 --> 06:57.949
- ¶ 'Cause you're
the Soda Stealer ¶

06:57.951 --> 07:00.419
¶¶

07:01.355 --> 07:05.557
- No, you're right, that save is
not worthy of my awesome voice.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.291
- Uh, question.

07:06.293 --> 07:10.896
When you said you were going
to help me, did you mean today?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.931
- On second thought, Mrs. Wong,
we decided

07:12.933 --> 07:14.833
we're not gonna help.
- Yeah.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.734
- Oh really?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.669
Well, I decided
I'm taking your drink

07:17.671 --> 07:19.938
to make up for the one
that guy stole!

07:19.940 --> 07:22.541
- [laughs]
She just took your drink.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.581
- ¶

07:30.317 --> 07:33.585
- [sighs] All day, and no saves
worthy of our Thundredth.

- ¶ We need a crime,
and we're stuck at 99 ¶

07:40.327 --> 07:43.328

me freezing your vocal cords.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.870
Professor Meteor has escaped.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.339
We believe he's planning
some sort of attack

07:54.341 --> 07:55.407
at the Hiddenville Planetarium.

07:55.409 --> 07:59.544
I'm switching you over to
their live security camera now.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.882
- There he is.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.817
It's so weird.
If Mom and Dad put him away

08:05.819 --> 08:08.753
20 years ago,
why does he look familiar?

08:08.755 --> 08:12.023
- MAX: Hey, he has
a to-go cup from Splat Burger.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.358
- Max, you know
what this means?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.595
- He stole the to-go cup from
the guy who stole the to-go cup?

08:16.597 --> 08:19.898
- No! The Soda Stealer
is Professor Meteor.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.600
We let him get away.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.801
- Don't tell Kickbutt.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.337
- Don't tell Kickbutt what?

And be careful.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.684
Super President Kickbutt out!

- We had the chance
to stop Professor Meteor

09:14.821 --> 09:17.856

- I know.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.492
Can you believe our luck?

09:20.494 --> 09:22.694

We blew it.

09:23.297 --> 09:27.132
Sweet, simple, pointy elbowed--
- Get to it.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.602
- Stopping an evil super villain
will make a great movie!

09:30.604 --> 09:33.538
- Mm, didn't think about it
like that.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.740
We'll be
world-famous movie stars.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.777
I'll get our super suits!
- I'll style my swoosh!

09:41.014 --> 09:43.148
- Also, you know, we'll be
keeping the world safe.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.550
- Yeah, it's totally
about helping people.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.786

10:38.005 --> 10:38.670
- [gasps]

10:38.672 --> 10:41.272
You guys are gonna rob
your parents of their precious

10:41.274 --> 10:44.542
family memory without me?

10:44.544 --> 10:46.878
I hope you get brain freeze!

10:47.047 --> 10:49.280
- I thought you said
I didn't have a brain.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.783
Make up your mind.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.118
- Guys, Colosso's right.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.821
Mom and Dad will be upset
if we eat this without them.

10:56.823 --> 10:57.989
- So what do we do now?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.192
- We put family first
and do the right thing.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.196
- We did not
do the right thing.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.899
- I can't feel my face.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.936

- Spielberg, baby,
this Thundredth movie

11:29.189 --> 11:33.792
is just what you need to get
your career back on track.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.592
- Max!

11:34.594 --> 11:36.828
- What do you mean
you're Steve Spillman?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.230
We've been talking
for 20 minutes.

11:40.233 --> 11:40.965
- This guy's bad news,

11:40.967 --> 11:45.070
so we can't just jump out and--
- Don't move, Meteor!

11:45.072 --> 11:47.072
- Why do I talk?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.073
- Who are you?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.008
And why do you have
the Thunderman logo

11:50.010 --> 11:51.209
on your super suits?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.310
- Thunderman's our dad.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.745
And our mom's Electress.

your parents since

12:06.993 --> 12:08.159
More like jerk-satsu.

Meteor?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.306
- I hit you with a G blast.

12:21.308 --> 12:21.840
[laughs]

12:21.842 --> 12:24.109
- What's the G stand for? Glue?
- Nope.

12:24.111 --> 12:24.843
- Gum?
- No.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.345
- Gravity?
- That's the one!

12:27.347 --> 12:28.780
I warped your gravity field,

12:28.782 --> 12:30.281
so now
you're pinned to the wall.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.817
So, uh, hang out. [laughs]

12:32.819 --> 12:37.055
And watch as I crash a meteor
into planet Earth. Ha-ha!

12:37.057 --> 12:40.225
- You could just say Earth.
We know it's a planet.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.794
- Mm, what's that?

12:42.796 --> 12:44.295

eating ice cream again.

ice cream again.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.210
Dang, I said ice cream.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.412
Dang, I said it again!

13:01.948 --> 13:04.282
- At least we still have
a few hours to recover

13:04.284 --> 13:06.217
before Mom and Dad get home.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.419
- MOM: Kids, we're home!

13:08.722 --> 13:12.724
- Uh. We cannot let them know
we ate that ice cream.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.292
Tuck in your gut.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.528
- Hey, guys.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.930
- Hey, parents,
your drone early.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.232
Sorry, I meant drone.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.835
- Turns out the tickets
were for next week.

13:23.837 --> 13:27.005
- Take notes, kids,
this is not how to husband.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.107
- But the good news is
we can eat the ginormous,

13:29.109 --> 13:32.043
super scoop ice cream
drone sundae together!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.778

13:34.381 --> 13:36.314
Uh, good idea.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.683
That sounds awesome.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.286

on the drive home.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.028
Mm, such a beautiful language.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.798
- Max, he's gonna launch
a meteor at Earth,

14:26.800 --> 14:27.799
we have to stop him.
- Right.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.501
Let's force our hands out
and hit 'm with some TK.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.404
- BOTH: [grunting]

14:33.406 --> 14:34.339
Ah!

14:34.341 --> 14:35.406
[groaning]

14:35.408 --> 14:37.075
- Gravity's too strong.

- Direct hit!

15:01.201 --> 15:03.234
[humming]

15:03.236 --> 15:04.402
I chipped off
a piece of the moon.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.939
And now it's a meteor headed
straight for Hiddenville.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.340
- You're gonna destroy
the town?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.075
- Just one house.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.210
- Mrs. Wong's?
- No.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.778
- Principal Bradford's?
- No.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.864
Just a few thousand more miles
to Thunderman's house,

15:32.866 --> 15:35.066
and then smashy-smashy!

15:35.068 --> 15:35.600
[laughing]

15:35.602 --> 15:38.036
- What is your beef with
Thunderman and Electress?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.470
They're amazing superheroes.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.239
You're--what's the word?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.473
Crazy pants!

15:42.475 --> 15:44.809
- 'Cause your parents
destroyed my lair

15:44.811 --> 15:46.144
and all my years of research!

15:46.146 --> 15:49.314
I was this close
to blowing up the sun!

15:49.316 --> 15:50.882
- Why would you do that?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.917
- I lost my sunglasses.

15:55.221 --> 15:55.987
- This is all our fault.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.956
Why didn't we stop him
when we had the chance?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.824
- Because we wanted a save
worthy of a movie.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.526
And you wanted people
to randomly sing and dance

16:01.528 --> 16:04.295
for no reason.
- It's called a musical!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.497
Doesn't matter anymore
now that our family's in danger.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.333
- I know.
We have to do something.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.169
- Oh, his helmet seems to be
the source of his powers.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.070
Maybe if we knock it off,

16:12.072 --> 16:13.538
it will release
this hold over us.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.506
- Help force my arm out.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.076
[grunting]

16:18.078 --> 16:18.943
Ah!

16:18.945 --> 16:21.145

not liking musicals.

- Okay.
[grunting]

16:27.053 --> 16:29.821

You can't remove my helmet.

I have a chin strap.

a fan of musicals.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.132
[laughs]

16:41.134 --> 16:43.034
I was the lead

17:00.887 --> 17:03.287
- Well, that was the first
musical I ever liked.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.188
- It's gonna be our last

17:04.190 --> 17:06.524
unless we warn Mom and Dad
about the meteor.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.159
- Reven--

17:09.896 --> 17:11.062
- Uh, it's all static.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.397
- The meteor must be blocking
the reception.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.099
- Then we're gonna have to run
home and stop it ourselves.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.868
- But, wait,
stop a giant moon rock

17:16.870 --> 17:18.970
from going smashy-smashy?
What if we can't?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.605
- Then we go smashy-smashy!

We are eating this right now.

say how much--[sobbing]--

We thought you guys wanted

18:27.006 --> 18:28.372
the ice cream drone sundae.

18:28.374 --> 18:32.410
- We did, which is why
we ate one two hours ago.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.313

- Yeah, what?

18:37.951 --> 18:39.350

feel any better,

ice cream again.

to eat all this ice cream

18:51.998 --> 18:53.164
by ourselves?

18:53.166 --> 18:54.632
- Wait, where'd it go?

19:24.430 --> 19:25.463
- Technically, it's a meteoroid

19:25.465 --> 19:27.098
now that it's in
Earth's atmosphere.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.000
- Technically,
are you kidding me?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.401
Give it all you've got!

19:30.403 --> 19:35.606
- ¶

19:36.376 --> 19:38.009
- Lower it down.

19:38.011 --> 19:43.247
- ¶

19:44.751 --> 19:47.018
- What was that noise?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.052
- A meteor?

19:48.054 --> 19:49.587
- Technically,
it's a meteoroid.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.256
- Actually, it's a meteorite
now that it's on the ground.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.258
I'm sorry, I had to say it.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.326
- Professor Meteor got out?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.228
- He wanted revenge
against you and Mom.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.696
But Max and I stopped him.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.700
- Hank,
the kids saved all our lives.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.234
- Wow.

20:03.236 --> 20:07.071
Ooh, talk about a save that
would make a great movie.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.506
- He's right,
we're gonna get a movie.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.175
- Coming this fall,
Max Thunderman--

20:11.177 --> 20:12.343
- And Phoebe Thunderman.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.178
- --save their family's life.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.146
- Then they sing a song.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.348
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.149
- In...

20:18.151 --> 20:21.686
- BOTH: "The Thundredth."

20:21.688 --> 20:25.756
- Don't call action yet,
Thunder Twins.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.357
- Perfect.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.159
Guess who just defeated
Professor Meteor?

20:28.161 --> 20:30.428
- The same superheroes
who didn't apprehend him

20:30.430 --> 20:34.432
when he stole a refill
at Splat Burger this morning?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.834
- Yes. No. What?

20:38.137 --> 20:40.538
- Look, we stopped a moon rock.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.840
- No save!

20:42.842 --> 20:46.143
- Kids, you never
violate the Superhero Code.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.778
- We're sorry. We just--

20:47.780 --> 20:49.647
we got a little caught up
in making sure

20:49.649 --> 20:53.150
our Thundredth save
was worthy of a movie.

20:53.386 --> 20:57.221
- Look,
I'm double scooping it, baby.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.161
- Whoa, nice save.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.297
- Don't be silly, Chloe,

21:06.299 --> 21:09.600
that doesn't count as--
- Congrats on your 100th save!

21:09.602 --> 21:11.102
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:11.104 --> 21:13.271
- Don't worry, Phoebe,
that save is way too lame.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.306
They'll never make a movie
out of it.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.742
- Or will they?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.242
- ¶

21:18.244 --> 21:21.412
- Look, I'm double scooping it,
baby.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.446
- ¶

21:22.448 --> 21:26.684
- Goshy-woshy, Baby Chloe's
ice cream is about to fall.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.487
- We better spring into action,
Super Phoebs.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.356
- BOTH: Thunder Fluppies
to the rescue!

21:32.358 --> 21:38.562
- ¶

21:41.367 --> 21:43.567
- Wow, nice save!

21:43.569 --> 21:46.504
- And remember,
the key to a super potty.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.906
- It's your duty
to wash your hands

21:48.908 --> 21:50.841
after a doody.

21:53.179 --> 21:58.582
- ¶

21:58.584 --> 22:00.718
- I don't believe this.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.787
- Who would possibly like this?

22:02.789 --> 22:05.456
- BOTH: Again, again, again!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.792
- ¶

22:10.496 --> 22:15.733
- ¶

22:18.271 --> 22:23.374
¶

22:33.853 --> 22:38.556
