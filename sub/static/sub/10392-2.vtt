WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.372
For Korean-Americans,
according to the stereotype

00:05.373 --> 00:06.373
anyway, it used to be that you

00:06.374 --> 00:10.543
grew up to be a doctor,
a lawyer, an engineer.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.347
There were a specific set
of rules and expectations.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.982
Are you asking me
to be in a porno?

00:15.983 --> 00:17.384
Is that what you're asking me?

00:17.385 --> 00:20.120
Thanks to some remarkably
bad Koreans, though,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.222
things are beginning to change.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.923
I went to one year of law
school and I walked out.

00:23.924 --> 00:24.892
So you're a bad Korean.

00:24.892 --> 00:25.793
Yeah, I'm a bad Korean.

00:25.794 --> 00:26.826
Any final advice for somebody

00:26.827 --> 00:28.928
who's actually about to
marry a Korean woman?

00:28.929 --> 00:30.398
Don't do it.

All I knew was that this
town was going down,

01:21.282 --> 01:23.116
and no one was showing up.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.317
And so we as Koreans

01:24.318 --> 01:25.985
figured that out really quickly.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.019
There's a point where you and I

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
look at each other and say.

01:28.021 --> 01:28.689
They're not coming.

01:28.690 --> 01:30.123
They're not coming, Tony.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.191
You know? Like, it's you and me.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.225
Right. Right. The choppers

01:32.226 --> 01:33.194
will not be here anytime soon.

01:33.195 --> 01:35.962
You know? Yeah, I mean,
so that's when all the

01:35.963 --> 01:37.397
stuff started to go down.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.633
Roy Choi is a second-generation
Korean American.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.169
He lives in Los Angeles.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.870
He's the owner/operator of

01:43.871 --> 01:45.472
four groundbreaking and much

01:45.473 --> 01:47.540
loved food trucks, among the

01:47.541 --> 01:49.309
first to harness the strange

01:49.310 --> 01:50.877
and terrible powers of social

01:50.878 --> 01:52.679
media to alert customers to

01:52.680 --> 01:55.516
where to find delicious food.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.851
This was the command post.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.320
From here, you know, you could

02:00.321 --> 02:03.156
look, and you could see
if fires were going on.

02:03.157 --> 02:06.226
When the Los Angeles
riots happened in 1992,

02:06.227 --> 02:08.060
Roy was 22 years old.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.696
And this plaza's rooftop played

02:09.697 --> 02:12.999
a central role for Koreans
defending their town.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.468
But let's back up a bit.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.836
After the Immigration Act of

02:16.837 --> 02:21.674
1965, thousands of Koreansof
began arriving in L.A.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.043
The first to arrive were
mostly middle-class,

02:24.044 --> 02:26.913
college-educated, hoping
to make a lateral move

02:26.914 --> 02:28.881
into American society.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.351
But unless you had a medical
or engineering degree,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.786
that turned out to be tough.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.023
They found work as
merchants, store owners,

02:37.024 --> 02:40.193
opened liquor stores,
groceries, massage studios,

02:40.194 --> 02:41.361
dry cleaners.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.464
They did that in an area
that was, as it's called,

02:44.465 --> 02:45.965
underserved.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.301
Where major chains
feared to tread, where

02:48.302 --> 02:52.872
others preferred to
abandon, Koreans moved in.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.107
So, 1992.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.545
Four L.A. police officers

02:58.546 --> 03:00.313
are on trial for what sure as

03:00.314 --> 03:02.482
hell looked to me like a wildly

03:02.483 --> 03:04.417
excessive and prolonged beating

03:04.418 --> 03:07.119
of an unarmed Rodney King.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.056
In April of that year,
they were acquitted.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.724
For me, it was a, "Holy shit, I

03:11.725 --> 03:12.593
never saw that coming" moment. I

03:12.594 --> 03:14.394
For African Americans, it

03:14.395 --> 03:16.229
was a somewhat ruder surprise.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.232
To say people were angry
would be an understatement.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.335
They don't represent
the people no more.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.570
South Central is that way.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.637
So, you could almost feel it

03:24.638 --> 03:26.406
like a tidal wave coming.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.940
The L.A.P.D. were completely

03:27.941 --> 03:30.977
unprepared for what
happened next.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.979
Everything you see right
here, all this, was being

03:32.980 --> 03:34.281
looted.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.449
Chairs and rocks and everything

03:36.450 --> 03:37.917
being thrown through walls.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.086
If you go straight down
Western, on Venice,

03:40.087 --> 03:42.021
the whole plaza burned on fire.

03:42.022 --> 03:46.326
We were calling 911 and
there was no response.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.594
Did cops come at all?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.262
I was here all three days.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.763
I didn't see any cops.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.765
Well, where did they set
up their front line?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.133
Rodeo Drive.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.669
Where did the forces of law
and order set up their

03:56.670 --> 03:57.505
perimeter?

03:57.506 --> 03:59.038
Not here.

03:59.039 --> 04:03.109
Koreatown was left
to its own devices.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.143
The official borders are

04:04.144 --> 04:05.712
Third Street on the north end,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.447
Olympic Boulevard to the south,

04:07.448 --> 04:09.181
Vermont Avenue on the east,

04:09.182 --> 04:11.451
and Western Avenue to the west.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.121
That's three square miles
left pretty much to burn

04:15.122 --> 04:17.358
or fend for itself.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.628
This rooftop quickly became
the command post for

04:21.629 --> 04:25.965
rapidly improvised
Korean defense forces.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.668
They armed themselves, set
up crude but effective

04:28.669 --> 04:32.472
command and control
communication, and patrols.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.540
We weren't going around just

04:33.541 --> 04:35.342
slugging and-and capping people.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.343
All that was happening was,

04:36.344 --> 04:39.479
"Just don't break
down my store."

04:39.480 --> 04:42.815
Making sure our parents,
our uncles, our families,

04:42.816 --> 04:46.487
these stores, this
town, stays alive.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.922
58 people were killed.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.159
Only a quarter of Korean-owned
businesses survived,

04:53.160 --> 04:55.428
either destroyed outright
during the riots

04:55.429 --> 04:56.863
or abandoned afterwards by

04:56.864 --> 04:58.665
owners who felt the entire

04:58.666 --> 05:00.433
underpinning of their contract

05:00.434 --> 05:03.035
with America had shifted.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.872
Yet today, Koreatown is
bigger and better and

05:05.873 --> 05:09.677
forever changed by
what happened in 1992.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.682
Dong Il Jang, however, is
as unwaveringly old school

05:15.683 --> 05:17.684
as you get.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.020
Roy and I sit down with Roy
Kim, whose grandfather

05:21.021 --> 05:23.956
opened the place in 1978.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.025
Like most Korean
restaurants at the time,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.595
you didn't mess with
the original, ever.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.263
And like most Korean
father/son relationships,

05:31.264 --> 05:34.934
you obeyed Dad's
wishes no matter what.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.704
My father put all this,
you know, redwood in,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.105
and all this cherry
and all this.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.941
But, to this day, I
can't touch certain

05:41.942 --> 05:42.610
things here.

05:42.611 --> 05:44.377
I can see he doesn't let
you change the uniforms

05:44.378 --> 05:45.212
either.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.046
Uh, no.

05:46.047 --> 05:47.246
Yeah.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.048
Well, he still controls
the restaurant.

05:49.049 --> 05:49.983
You just do the work.

05:49.984 --> 05:51.150
I just do the work.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.387
As a Korean, he knows.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.724
We start with bonchon, all
those delicious little

05:57.725 --> 05:58.925
freebie plates of pickles,

05:58.926 --> 06:00.259
preserves, kimchi, pickles,

06:00.260 --> 06:02.228
a spicy squid snack or two.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.830
No bonchon?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.264
No meal.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.066
And you know what this
restaurant has that a lot of

06:07.067 --> 06:08.067
restaurants are going away from?

06:08.068 --> 06:10.637
Is the, um... is the
chair-less rooms.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.739
You don't do the-the feet under?

06:12.740 --> 06:13.940
Knees forward, feet under?

06:13.941 --> 06:14.675
All the-the tea ceremonies.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.576
Straight ahead?

06:15.577 --> 06:16.809
Oh, no can do.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.445
That was punishment for Koreans.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.112
Yeah.

06:19.112 --> 06:19.747
That's a punishment.

06:19.748 --> 06:21.247
And with the book
over your head.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.248
Oh, for hours.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.315
What would a crime be?

06:23.316 --> 06:25.418
What got you into
that, uh, position?

06:25.419 --> 06:26.586
Yeah, I mean, it could be

06:26.587 --> 06:30.423
as-as minimal as a
94 on the test.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.624
Korean parents?

06:31.625 --> 06:34.627
Well, let's just say they
veer towards the strict.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.963
Moms and Dads were not,
shall we say, conflicted

06:36.964 --> 06:38.598
about corporal punishment.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.234
I love that you both
immediately recognize this.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.936
Oh, this is the roast gui.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.271
This is what we're known...

06:45.272 --> 06:47.507
It's thinly sliced
rib-eye, marbled rib-eye.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.608
Oh, it's beautiful.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.876
Roast gui.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.310
Thin-sliced rib-eye.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.945
And bulgogi.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.881
Thinly-sliced, fat-marbled

06:54.882 --> 06:57.684
beef, barbecued table-side.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.985
For us Koreans, it's kind of

06:58.986 --> 07:01.488
funny that barbecue has become

07:01.489 --> 07:03.122
the gateway to our food, though.

07:03.123 --> 07:03.657
Hey, it could be worse.

07:03.658 --> 07:04.891
It could be worse, yeah.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.559
At least it's delicious.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.193
It's delicious and we're
like, "Okay, this is the-

07:07.194 --> 07:08.227
this is the portal."

07:08.228 --> 07:09.696
We're cool with that.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.632
Then there's kimchi
bulgogi bokkeumbap.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.366
Basically kimchi fried rice.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.069
But it fries into the
pan like paella.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.472
So many great rice dishes
where that outer layer of

07:19.473 --> 07:22.041
crispy stuff is just the best.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.876
The tableside cooking.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.145
I think people overlook that a lot.
You know,

07:26.146 --> 07:30.316
this is like crepes suzette,
filleting a Dover sole.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.920
Oh man, that's just
ridiculously delicious.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.888
Will you be doing
this in 20 years?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.223
It won't change.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.425
If we did change tonight,
I would get a complaint.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.494
And you'd have to
talk to your dad.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.495
Oh, yeah.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
That's-that's a problem.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.003
What do you do if you're
a locavore in L.A.?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.172
You look around.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.509
What's local and delicious,
artisanal and authentic,

07:56.510 --> 07:58.044
and as iconically L.A.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.411
as it gets?

07:59.412 --> 08:02.248
If you're Roy Choi,
you see tacos.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.518
And with Kogi Truck, Roy
Choi brought one of the

08:05.519 --> 08:07.453
first great mutation mash-ups

08:07.454 --> 08:10.890
of Korean and Mexican
to the people.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.693
What started as one truck
became four trucks and

08:13.694 --> 08:16.462
three brick-and-mortar
restaurants to go with them.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.365
For me, Kogi was always
one truck in my mind.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.034
But then the lines
got big, you know?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.571
And it evolved.

08:24.772 --> 08:25.939
Hola, Herlindo.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.245
Roy trained at the Culinary
Institute of America

08:33.246 --> 08:36.616
and interned at Le Bernardin
in New York City.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.750
He runs his trucks like you'd

08:37.751 --> 08:40.119
expect of someone
with that background.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.322
Within our food media
landscape, we've romanticized

08:43.323 --> 08:46.726
certain compositions of
what a great chef and

08:46.727 --> 08:49.662
a-and-and a great kitchen
are supposed to look and

08:49.663 --> 08:50.763
smell and feel like.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.831
But just because those are

08:51.832 --> 08:54.066
beautiful doesn't mean that
this is not beautiful.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.968
For me, I don't see mustard

08:55.969 --> 08:57.937
plants and sheep grazing.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.973
I see barbed wire and
telephone poles,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.174
and I see puddles.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.077
And, you know, all of that
stuff contribute to the

09:05.078 --> 09:06.613
flavor of the food.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.515
So, it's truly what I call
a terroir, you know, uh,

09:09.516 --> 09:11.017
a regional food.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.419
Okay, gracias.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.555
And they're off.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.931
Every lunch shift
and every evening,

09:24.932 --> 09:27.466
the trucks' locations are
sent out over Twitter.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.802
The locations change every day.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.170
And people flock quicklyry day.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.207
To find them, as the
lines can get long.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
Very long.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.113
I took a run with Roy as he
made his nightly rounds.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.215
So, how often do you
make the full circuit

09:43.216 --> 09:45.952
between all of your, uh,
various enterprises?

09:45.953 --> 09:47.119
Twice a day, every day,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.488
unless I'm doing something
crazy like this.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.457
So it's kind of like I have

09:50.458 --> 09:54.326
a-a huge Las Vegas hotel,
but the hallways are the

09:54.327 --> 09:55.629
streets.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.131
First stop: Chego, a
rice bowl place in the

09:59.132 --> 10:01.167
Palms neighborhood.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.802
These are my guys right here.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.136
Hola!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.137
Hey, Chef.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.675
Kimchi spam, classic.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.309
Yeah, this is the
menu right here.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.978
A big bowl of rice with meat,

10:11.979 --> 10:14.313
vegetables, and lots of flavor,

10:14.314 --> 10:16.248
for less than 10 bucks.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.985
Good deal.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.990
But it's funny to hear
you're so sentimental

10:23.991 --> 10:26.225
about the business
of feeding people.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.661
It's a trippy state
of romanticism,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.830
like I'm very hard-assed, too.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.531
Like, you pack your own shit.

10:32.532 --> 10:33.666
You get what you get.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.168
If you complain, I take the
food out of your hands.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.870
I give you your money back.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.373
But within those rules,
there's a lot of love,

10:41.374 --> 10:43.877
and there's-there's
a lot of care.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.015
Across town in
Venice is A-Frame,

10:49.016 --> 10:51.018
Roy's first brick-and-mortar.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.720
This used to be an IHOP,
so everything's...

10:53.721 --> 10:54.854
Oh, yeah?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.255
Yeah, everything's
really narrow.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.524
Ah, hence the, uh, the shape.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.726
It's heavily influenced by

10:59.727 --> 11:02.394
local takes on Hawaiianed
by cooking, not that you'd

11:02.395 --> 11:03.863
necessarily notice.

11:03.864 --> 11:08.134
Every dish designed to
be eaten with the hands.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.201
What's good?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.570
The baby back ribs are
air-dried, braised,

11:11.571 --> 11:13.372
then breaded and fried.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.375
Lean cod tacos treated
like shawarma.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.077
Beer can crackling chicken:

11:18.078 --> 11:20.612
it's brined, rotisseried,
then air-dried like

11:20.613 --> 11:22.515
Peking duck, then fried.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.886
Meanwhile, not too far
away, on Sawtelle,

11:26.887 --> 11:31.423
a Kogi truck pulls up,
stops, reverses back to the

11:31.424 --> 11:32.658
corner.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.993
Before the awning is even up,

11:33.994 --> 11:35.828
there's already a line.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.996
Hungry people have been waiting

11:36.997 --> 11:39.498
in cars or around the corner
ever since the Twitter

11:39.499 --> 11:41.233
announcement 30 minutes ago.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.468
Yeah, this is just.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.303
I feel guilty.

11:43.304 --> 11:44.771
I'm jumping the line, right?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.138
Wow. What's the longest line

11:46.139 --> 11:47.940
you've ever had at
one of these things?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.075
600.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.910
600 people for one truck?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.578
Yeah.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.847
The Kogi taco:

11:54.848 --> 11:56.315
double-caramelized Korean

11:56.316 --> 11:57.649
barbecue short rib on fresh

11:57.650 --> 12:00.086
corn tortilla, salsa roja,

12:00.087 --> 12:02.154
cilantro-onion-lime relish, and

12:02.155 --> 12:04.190
a Napa cabbage/romaine slaw ind

12:04.191 --> 12:06.126
a chili-soy vinaigrette.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.930
Oh, yeah.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.866
The-the rep for Kogi is
that we go everywhere.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.334
We go to every single corner

12:15.335 --> 12:17.636
of the county and the city.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.705
We're not just going
to the hip areas.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.841
What about fantastically...
Uh, what about Bel Air?

12:21.842 --> 12:23.309
Can you pull up, like, on
a corner in a residential

12:23.310 --> 12:24.443
area in Bel Air?

12:24.444 --> 12:24.912
Yeah, yeah. We go.

12:24.912 --> 12:25.846
What happens then?

12:25.846 --> 12:26.814
Do you get rousted?

12:26.814 --> 12:27.514
Or...?

12:27.515 --> 12:30.282
No, no, they come out in
the Versace robe and, uh.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.550
That I gotta see.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.718
Yeah, yeah.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.487
Beverly Hills, Beverly
Hills, uh, lunch is crazy.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.990
Why should you be excited
about food trucks?

12:37.991 --> 12:40.459
Because they allow
creative chefs like Roy,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.494
without a lot of money,
to start creating and

12:42.495 --> 12:44.797
selling their stuff,
introducing themselves to

12:44.798 --> 12:46.799
the world, without
having to gather up

12:46.800 --> 12:49.668
a million dollars or
credulous partners.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.803
And they're affordable.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.038
They're democratic.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.140
And they are faster, better,

12:54.141 --> 12:57.009
and infinitely preferable
to fast food like the king

12:57.010 --> 12:59.612
and the clown and the colonel.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.193
Stereotyping?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.395
Coming... Look, how
do I put this?

13:16.396 --> 13:19.065
Good Korean kids grow
up to be doctors,

13:19.066 --> 13:21.567
lawyers, or engineers,
goes the story.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.269
There are expectations.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.238
But what if you're a bad Korean?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.574
What if you were Korean
American and you just

13:28.575 --> 13:30.242
didn't give a...?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.078
What if you looked
around, asked yourself,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.079
"Who am I?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.246
Who am I supposed to be?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.082
Where do I fit in society?"

13:36.083 --> 13:37.516
and were unsatisfied with the

13:37.517 --> 13:39.251
answers you were getting?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.252
What if you were an insanely

13:40.253 --> 13:41.753
talented artist and a small

13:41.754 --> 13:44.090
startup company called Facebook

13:44.091 --> 13:46.758
asked you to do some
murals in their offices,

13:46.759 --> 13:47.694
and they paid you in stock,

13:47.695 --> 13:49.761
and you became
ridiculously wealthy

13:49.762 --> 13:51.964
and you still didn't give a...?

13:51.965 --> 13:55.268
Well, then, you might
be David Choe.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.141
Hi.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.141
I'm Dave Choe.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.219
Be like me.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.556
Is that an AK piñata?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.458
That is an AK-47 piñata.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.592
Wow.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.727
So, I mean, this place is in

14:21.728 --> 14:23.329
downtown L.A., so I try to have

14:23.330 --> 14:25.297
as many weapons, like,
hidden throughout.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.334
I got ninja swords and
ninja stars and stuff.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.103
You need. you need a puppy, man.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.837
You need a puppy.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.806
I do need a puppy.

14:34.841 --> 14:35.908
I'm going to paint you today.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.509
Is that cool?

14:36.510 --> 14:38.510
Yeah, sure.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.845
All right, so, just sit.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.780
Sit?

14:40.781 --> 14:43.983
Right there. And. sorry.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.386
Don't usually paint this
early in the morning.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.257
Okay.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.860
I'm going to go more
expressionistic,

14:54.861 --> 15:00.632
if you don't mind.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.768
I want to know... you were
on record, you said,

15:02.769 --> 15:03.835
you know, uh, young people,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.771
uh, looking to follow
your road to success,

15:05.772 --> 15:07.506
your advice is, whatever you do,

15:07.507 --> 15:09.175
don't date a Korean girl.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.542
Oh, okay.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.344
I try to be open-minded
about things, right?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.046
But, well, I'm racist.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.116
You know, uh, for me,
I've given it a sh-shot.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.052
And then I end up in a
situation where I feel like

15:20.053 --> 15:21.520
I'm dating my mom.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.821
So, what characteristics, uh,

15:22.822 --> 15:25.857
in common were-were-were-w...
Overbearing.

15:25.858 --> 15:26.826
Overbearing.

15:26.827 --> 15:29.795
Uh, jealous. Unreasonable.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.698
Like, unrealistic about life.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.001
Demanding. Like, it's...

15:35.002 --> 15:36.335
I mean, I could go on and on.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.669
But also, the men, too.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.671
Like, if you're a woman, I
wouldn't never recommend

15:39.672 --> 15:40.973
dating a Korean guy.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.674
For the very few women out

15:42.675 --> 15:44.310
there that are into Asian guys,

15:44.311 --> 15:45.711
if you are going to go that

15:45.712 --> 15:48.015
route, definitely go Chinese.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.354
Yeah, come check it out.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.223
Oh, yeah.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.225
Whoa, awesome.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.894
Wow.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.496
I don't know;

16:03.496 --> 16:04.397
what do you think?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.698
Dude. I'm honored.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.500
I've never had my
portrait done before.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.169
Thank you, man.

16:09.169 --> 16:09.736
Hey, man.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.537
You're welcome.

16:10.538 --> 16:12.871
And this shit going to be
worth some money on eBay

16:12.872 --> 16:14.841
for sure.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.547
Now I'm definitely
ready for Sizzler.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.815
Nice.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.089
Standing tall and prominent

16:30.090 --> 16:31.590
amongst the many Asian and

16:31.591 --> 16:33.759
Central American restaurants
in the community,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.894
one place holds an unexpectedly

16:35.895 --> 16:37.596
cherished position in the

16:37.597 --> 16:41.233
collective memories of many
second-generation Korean

16:41.234 --> 16:42.568
Americans.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.537
I am personally unfamiliar
with the Sizzler brand.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.240
Oh, I know it by name, but
never have I managed to

16:48.241 --> 16:51.043
actually cross its doors.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.278
After you.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.880
Oh, thank you.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.083
Wow.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.617
How are you doing today?

16:58.618 --> 16:59.419
I'm doing good, thank you.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.387
How about yourself?

17:00.388 --> 17:01.388
I'm doing fantastic.

17:01.389 --> 17:03.122
I got my Sizzler outfit on.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.455
So, here's the thing.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.991
You can get, like, a steak and

17:05.992 --> 17:07.626
then add the salad bar with it.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.461
Right.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.895
You get the best
bang for your buck.

17:09.896 --> 17:10.962
Or you can just get
the salad bar.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.498
I'm gonna have a
little bit of steak.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.799
I am gonna go traditional and

17:13.800 --> 17:15.134
just get just the salad bar.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.301
And just the salad bar only.

17:16.303 --> 17:16.969
Yeah. Thank you.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.104
You can have a seat
anywhere you like.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.073
Terrific. Thanks.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.012
Excellent.

17:27.012 --> 17:27.980
Oh, yeah.

17:27.981 --> 17:28.981
Pouring for your elders.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.516
Oh, now you're getting
all Korean on me.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.817
Yeah. Super embarrassed right

17:31.818 --> 17:32.851
now, because we're in Koreatown

17:32.852 --> 17:34.653
and I'm taking you to eat at

17:34.654 --> 17:36.021
Sizzler, which, for a lot of

17:36.022 --> 17:39.291
Koreans, is the best
food in Koreatown. Um.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.627
So, if you were eating
non-Korean, this was it?

17:41.628 --> 17:42.861
We never ate out, ever.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.165
And if we did, it
was McDonald's.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.999
And if it was a birthday
and a special celebration,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.635
you wanted to kick it up a
notch and go a little bit

17:49.636 --> 17:51.971
more special, then
it was Sizzler.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.642
This is a judgment-free zone,

17:56.643 --> 17:58.210
where there are no mistakes,

17:58.211 --> 18:00.146
a world to explore incongruous

18:00.147 --> 18:03.182
combinations without
shame or guilt,

18:03.183 --> 18:06.152
free of criticism
from snarkologists,

18:06.153 --> 18:10.522
because there are no
snarkologists at Sizzler.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.991
Obviously here's all the
accouterments for making a

18:12.992 --> 18:15.461
nice nacho, taco salad.
Here... Right.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.795
All the stuff for the.

18:16.796 --> 18:17.364
Pasta.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.131
Pasta, spaghetti, whatever.

18:18.132 --> 18:20.366
The move is you get a hard taco

18:20.367 --> 18:21.733
shell and you put meatballs in

18:21.734 --> 18:23.034
it. This is Italian/Mexican

18:23.035 --> 18:24.670
dining, and you make a meatball

18:24.671 --> 18:26.372
taco. And there's nowhere else

18:26.373 --> 18:27.739
in the world where you can have

18:27.740 --> 18:30.209
this. You put three meatballs in

18:30.210 --> 18:33.044
the taco, some guacamole, and

18:33.045 --> 18:35.681
then you put all this nacho

18:35.682 --> 18:36.882
cheese, all this other stuff.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.317
Oh, I-I know what I'm doing.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.385
I'm going for the full South of

18:39.386 --> 18:40.519
the Border experience here.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.388
All right.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.322
Well, there you go.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.223
Oh, no, no.

18:43.224 --> 18:44.590
I'm not kidding around here.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.060
Oh, yeah, now we're
talking, my friend.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.897
It's a little bit nicer
than I remember.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.832
There it is.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.835
That's the best bread
that you can get,

18:56.836 --> 18:58.337
so you tell me if you like that.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.038
Oh, now, wait a minute.

18:59.039 --> 19:00.071
Are you saying that the

19:00.072 --> 19:01.407
cheese toast is complimentary?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.342
It's complimentary.

19:02.343 --> 19:03.609
And once we found that out,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.076
we would order stacks of it.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.078
So, it was our favorite
part of Sizzler.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.079
And we were like, "We need to

19:08.080 --> 19:10.417
figure out how to
manufacture this at home."

19:12.285 --> 19:14.553
So, were you good Sizzler
customers, your family?

19:14.554 --> 19:15.422
Do you think they were happy

19:15.422 --> 19:16.189
to see you when you come in?

19:16.190 --> 19:19.090
I mean.

19:19.091 --> 19:19.759
Um.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.293
I love this dish, man.

19:20.294 --> 19:21.927
I might-I might, uh... when
I go back, I might have

19:21.928 --> 19:23.595
to have a meatball taco.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.697
Um, so, we didn't we, like,

19:25.698 --> 19:27.032
gooched the system a little bit,

19:27.033 --> 19:29.435
but not like
completely abused it.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.602
There would be the guilt

19:30.603 --> 19:32.604
associated with
we never eat out,

19:32.605 --> 19:33.573
but now we're going out to

19:33.574 --> 19:35.774
eat, so you better... eat.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.944
You got to put down at
least three plates.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.746
So, what'd you think
of the bread?

19:40.747 --> 19:41.414
It's delicious.

19:41.415 --> 19:42.614
Yeah. It's the best.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.650
Oh, I totally get why this
would be a wonderland.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.752
Yeah, everything's really good.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.221
For you, Sizzler, a
happy place, still.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.456
Lots of memories.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.958
It's satisfying.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.096
We need more of
this cheese bread.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.508
Something Dave Choe and Roy
Choi have in common is

20:09.509 --> 20:12.344
that they may be Korean
American, but they are also

20:12.345 --> 20:14.746
very much creatures of L.A.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.415
And what is L.A.?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.251
L.A. is Mexican,
Central American,

20:19.252 --> 20:24.690
Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai,
Samoan, Bangladeshi.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.525
Everybody who's left their mark

20:26.526 --> 20:28.527
continues to shape the town,

20:28.528 --> 20:30.496
determine its character.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.765
K-Town exists right upside
its Latino neighbors, and

20:33.766 --> 20:36.302
I guess it's natural
that both Choe and Choi

20:36.303 --> 20:40.239
identify very much with
Mexican street culture.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.143
Few things embody that
particularly Southern

20:45.144 --> 20:46.445
California Latino street

20:46.446 --> 20:50.750
culture more than low-riding.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.727
Estevan Oriol is a photographer.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.828
Go on the other
side of that pole.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.297
Chronicler of everything
iconic at the crossroads of

21:05.298 --> 21:09.801
hip-hop, design, tattooing,
fashion, and low-riding.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.571
The old timers, they
used to cut the coils or

21:12.572 --> 21:13.972
put bricks or sandbags in their

21:13.973 --> 21:15.741
trunk to make them lower.

21:15.742 --> 21:19.811
And then around the '70s
is when it got popular.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.981
Why these particular
models of cars?

21:22.982 --> 21:25.083
It's pretty much always
been, uh, late '50s,

21:25.084 --> 21:27.919
all the way through the
'60s, and into the '70s.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.355
And then the '80s came up.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.422
They started bringing in the

21:30.423 --> 21:34.225
Cadillacs and the Regals.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.061
The most classic, well-known car

21:36.062 --> 21:39.499
for low-riding probably
is the '64 Impala.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.271
How many Korean
low-riders are there?

21:46.272 --> 21:47.606
There's a few Asian ones

21:47.607 --> 21:49.274
sprinkled in the other clubs.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.378
More Asians, more more
Koreans than 15 years ago?

21:52.379 --> 21:54.713
We're seeing a crossover
with the food.

21:54.714 --> 21:55.348
Right.

21:55.349 --> 21:58.384
Uh... For the most part,
things are starting to get

21:58.385 --> 21:59.185
a lot more open.

21:59.186 --> 22:00.218
If you're asking, I think

22:00.219 --> 22:01.453
there's going to be a lot more

22:01.454 --> 22:03.956
Asian/Hispanic mixed babies
coming up in the future.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.559
I ain't mad at that.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.196
Ideal low-riding, is about
getting appreciated by

22:11.197 --> 22:12.931
the people who best appreciate

22:12.932 --> 22:17.268
the traditions and techniques,
the getting it right.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.506
For that, you head to East L.A.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.312
The most famous, notorious
street in L.A. is,

22:27.313 --> 22:28.614
uh, Whittier Boulevard,

22:28.615 --> 22:30.482
because of the history of it.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.819
And then Crenshaw Boulevard
and South Central.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.821
So, that's gonna be your
most critical audience?

22:35.822 --> 22:37.723
And, uh, mo- and at the
same most appreciative?

22:37.724 --> 22:38.658
Yeah, the ones that you want

22:38.659 --> 22:40.158
to see your car, you know?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.627
It's a slow-moving piece of

22:41.628 --> 22:43.829
art. And you treat the car like

22:43.830 --> 22:47.566
a piece of art, acutely
aware of the dangers: cops,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.234
for whom you are a target;

22:49.235 --> 22:50.669
potholes;

22:50.670 --> 22:52.804
other cars.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.273
In East L.A., you see
people ooh and ah.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.508
You see expressions change

22:56.509 --> 22:58.109
from, "Who the... is that?"

22:58.110 --> 23:01.146
to, "Nice ride."

23:01.147 --> 23:03.415
That was, like, a
full-fledged gang member.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.083
Yeah.

23:04.084 --> 23:06.017
You know, giving us, like,
props, giving us respect,

23:06.018 --> 23:08.019
you know?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.088
First you build a
car for yourself.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.023
But at the same time you're

23:11.024 --> 23:13.024
building it for the
streets, you know?

23:13.025 --> 23:14.526
You're building it
for the people.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.663
You want them to appreciate it.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.040
Within the borders of Koreatown,

23:29.041 --> 23:30.809
it's not just Koreans.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.378
There are new
arrivals every day.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.882
There is, in fact, an
official Little Bangladesh

23:36.883 --> 23:38.817
right in the middle of K-town.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.552
Oh, man, this is all so.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.653
It smells so good in here.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.655
Uh, yeah, this is going to work.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.457
So you're not short of
options around here.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.392
Nah. You can get tacos
across the street,

23:47.393 --> 23:49.060
Korean bibimbap right next door,

23:49.061 --> 23:50.996
and then get goat stew.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.733
You can pray to
Mohammed or Buddha.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.134
A tiny mosque next door where

23:56.135 --> 23:59.505
services are held
five times a day.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.006
Just talking to a guy in
the parking lot who said,

24:01.007 --> 24:03.241
"This is the first Little
Bangladesh in America."

24:03.242 --> 24:04.043
Yeah.

24:04.044 --> 24:05.744
And that just happened,
like, two years ago.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.713
Like, we went to
sleep, we woke up,

24:07.714 --> 24:08.981
and it was Little Bangladesh.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.322
Here at Sawada, step right
in to some curried goat,

24:17.323 --> 24:21.026
samosas, tandoori chicken.

24:21.027 --> 24:21.928
Oh, yeah, and this:

24:21.929 --> 24:25.564
Lahori fish curry, with no
small amount of chilies.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.600
It's such fragrant,
aromatic, delicious food.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.368
This is really good.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.703
What good food are you likely

24:31.704 --> 24:34.606
to find within the
confines of Koreatown?

24:34.607 --> 24:37.275
We have El Salvadoran and
Guatemalan all around.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.944
Koreans all throughout.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.446
Pakistani and Bangladesh food.

24:41.447 --> 24:45.016
Yeah, Oaxaca takes over
all of Eighth Street.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.785
Why Oaxaca? Just that's
the way it worked out?

24:46.786 --> 24:47.786
Mm hmm.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.721
Well, you know how it goes.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.388
Yeah.

24:49.388 --> 24:50.289
One guy showed up.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.057
Yeah.

24:51.058 --> 24:52.958
Filipino fast food
just behind us.

24:52.959 --> 24:53.626
Mm hmm.

24:53.627 --> 24:55.226
And then a bunch of
riff-raffs in between.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.095
Yeah. Well, Filipinos oughta

24:56.095 --> 24:57.029
be very proud of their food.

24:57.029 --> 24:57.630
Mm hmm.

24:57.631 --> 24:58.897
Underrepresented.

24:58.898 --> 24:59.632
I think they're going through

24:59.632 --> 25:00.533
kind of what we went through,

25:00.534 --> 25:01.567
where the glass hasn't been

25:01.568 --> 25:03.769
broken yet to-to translate it

25:03.770 --> 25:05.971
but still keep the
core and soul of it.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.940
But it tastes delicious.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.911
A few blocks over, the
iconic Filipino fast food

25:12.912 --> 25:15.080
chain Jollibee's.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.483
Laugh all you want,
but ask any Filipino.

25:18.484 --> 25:19.818
They love this drive-through

25:19.819 --> 25:21.386
mutation for specialties like

25:21.387 --> 25:23.488
this fried Spam sandwich thing.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.324
But it's the desserts where
it gets really crazy.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.926
Decisions, decisions.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.060
Here we go.

25:29.061 --> 25:32.831
Uh, we'll take one Aloha
burger and then one Spam

25:32.832 --> 25:34.432
little big bite.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.801
All right. Anything else?

25:35.802 --> 25:39.671
Uh, let's do a Halo halo, and that's it.
All right.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.506
Oh, look at that.

25:41.507 --> 25:42.841
What is what-what is that?

25:42.842 --> 25:44.275
That's a halo halo.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.144
Oh, yeah, halo halo.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.014
Dig deep and you hit delicious
stratas of red beans,

25:49.015 --> 25:50.515
white beans, and chickpeas,

25:50.516 --> 25:53.685
cubes of red and green
Jell-O, young white coconut,

25:53.686 --> 25:56.154
shaved ice- and is that flan?

25:56.155 --> 25:58.657
It makes no goddamn
sense at all.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.592
I love it.

25:59.593 --> 26:02.661
Part of every Pinoy
Filipino's life, halo halo.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.362
Nutsy, man.

26:03.363 --> 26:04.863
I got to take a picture of that.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.666
It's oddly beautiful.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.667
All right.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.368
All right.

26:09.368 --> 26:10.202
You know I'm getting a bite

26:10.202 --> 26:10.937
of that little what is it?

26:10.937 --> 26:11.638
A little.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.338
It's a little big bite.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.272
Little big bite.

26:13.273 --> 26:15.540
Favorite thing in the world.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.843
No, don't say that.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.180
That's actually... I like that.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.049
It's good, right?

26:23.050 --> 26:27.552
Aloha. I mean, it
just sounds magical.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.154
Is there, like, pineapple
in there or something?

26:29.155 --> 26:30.889
Yes. Hence the "aloha."

26:30.890 --> 26:33.458
That's a very tasty burger.

26:33.459 --> 26:34.860
Nice char.

26:34.861 --> 26:35.695
Asian fast food.

26:35.696 --> 26:37.663
It's fast food, but
it's made by like it

26:37.664 --> 26:40.165
was just a single family
owned restaurant.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.067
What family made this?

26:41.068 --> 26:42.300
Yeah, maybe.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.035
Maybe-maybe not your family.

26:43.035 --> 26:43.803
The Jetsons.

26:43.804 --> 26:46.471
You know?

26:46.472 --> 26:47.406
You like it?

26:47.407 --> 26:49.074
It's actually very tasty.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.176
Every single thing
you like here.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.913
Wow. There's so
much I don't know.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.901
It's true, Dad.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.502
We all look the same.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.239
I love it.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.108
He may be a Korean gone bad,

27:23.109 --> 27:24.710
but Dave Choe still tries,

27:24.711 --> 27:27.746
best he can, to be a good son.

27:27.747 --> 27:28.947
He bought them this house in

27:28.948 --> 27:33.251
Los Feliz and visits for
family meals often.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.753
In fact, when we first met,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.254
sensing it had been a long time

27:36.255 --> 27:37.355
without a true home-cooked time

27:37.356 --> 27:39.557
meal, he invited me
to dinner with them.

27:39.558 --> 27:42.260
So, guests are not unusual.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.930
Jane Cho is an amazing cook.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.765
It's going to be very delicious.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.067
Mom? Dad?

27:48.901 --> 27:50.301
Look who's here.

27:50.302 --> 27:50.837
Hello.

27:50.838 --> 27:51.937
Mom, Tony's here.

27:51.938 --> 27:52.905
Can you smell something?

27:52.906 --> 27:53.906
Oh, yeah.

27:53.906 --> 27:54.406
Yeah.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.141
Good stuff.

27:55.142 --> 27:56.908
Yeah, all the good
stuff's coming.

27:56.909 --> 28:01.447
Maybe somebody going
to hire me later.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.317
Okay, which ones are you?

28:07.453 --> 28:08.619
Are you the eldest?

28:08.620 --> 28:09.620
I'm the middle.

28:09.621 --> 28:12.057
I'm the suicidal pirate.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.293
Oh, already signs
of trouble appear.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.796
My older brother is the
hip-hop Santa, and my...

28:17.797 --> 28:18.597
He was the oldest.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.298
Right.

28:19.299 --> 28:20.565
He'd beat me up.

28:20.566 --> 28:21.800
I'd beat him up.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.902
And then he would just cry.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.670
I'll show you my dad's painting.

28:25.671 --> 28:26.305
Hey, Dad?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.073
Yeah?

28:27.074 --> 28:28.673
Hey, come over
here for a second.

28:28.674 --> 28:29.808
When did you paint this, Dad?

28:29.809 --> 28:30.809
30 years ago?

28:30.810 --> 28:33.244
Uh, '73. 1973.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.481
Every Christmas, he
unrolls it, um, and just,

28:36.482 --> 28:38.284
like, Scotch tapes
it to the wall.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.786
And my Mom's the artist
in the family now.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.321
So, this is a family of artists.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.190
The Choe's are devout

28:44.191 --> 28:45.824
Christians, which is not unusual

28:45.825 --> 28:47.258
in the Korean community.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.994
But they are unusual in that

28:48.995 --> 28:51.629
they're both artists of a sort.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.199
Jane treats the house like
an ongoing art project,

28:54.200 --> 28:56.768
drawing sunglasses
on family pictures,

28:56.769 --> 28:59.504
stapling angels to Dave's
paintings that have hung

28:59.505 --> 29:02.040
in the White House, getting
crazy with the glue gun,

29:02.041 --> 29:04.042
adorning wreaths with Happy Meal

29:04.043 --> 29:07.378
toys, sticker-bombing the
kitchen with birds, cows,

29:07.379 --> 29:10.481
spaceships piloted
by her three boys.

29:10.482 --> 29:14.519
She is relentlessly,
energetically, and inarguably

29:14.520 --> 29:15.854
creative.

29:15.855 --> 29:16.888
She brainwashed me.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.324
From the time we were
kids, she'd-she was like,

29:19.325 --> 29:20.691
"You're the best
artist in the world.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.127
You're the best
artist in the world."

29:22.128 --> 29:22.995
You are.

29:22.995 --> 29:23.995
Oh, thanks.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.563
But now she's telling me
she's going to be the best

29:25.564 --> 29:26.398
artist in the world.

29:26.399 --> 29:28.967
So, she's very competitive.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.969
She said she's gonna destroy me.

29:30.970 --> 29:31.970
Awesome.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.209
Food is ready.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.511
So, do you want to explain
what everything is, Mom?

29:40.512 --> 29:42.981
The food I prepared tonight

29:42.982 --> 29:45.884
is a very common Korean food.

29:45.885 --> 29:50.655
Which is a beef ribs, uh, stew.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.223
The kimchi's looking fresh.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.825
Yeah, the kimchi's fresh.

29:53.826 --> 29:56.061
Today is, uh, chestnut rice.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.163
No one has this kind of rice.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.397
It's a special rice.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.599
Special rice for Tony, you know.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.401
And then stuffed peppers.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.536
Oh, that's David's favorite.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.438
Chung po mook:

30:06.439 --> 30:08.206
seaweed and jellied mung bean.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.242
Vermicelli noodles
with shitake mushrooms

30:11.243 --> 30:12.510
and vegetables.

30:12.511 --> 30:16.081
Avocado egg rolls, fried
squid, and shrimps.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.448
Potato pancake.

30:17.449 --> 30:18.749
Often at the Cho house there's

30:18.750 --> 30:21.419
a few Mexican dishes
sprinkled in as well.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.256
It is always a great meal,
I can tell you that.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.357
Thanks, Mom.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.425
This is delicious.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.560
This is awesome.

30:29.628 --> 30:30.929
It is indeed. Thank you.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.364
I love it.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.567
During the riots of '92, Jim
and Jane Choe worked as

30:36.568 --> 30:38.970
real estate agents and
property managers.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.238
So the destruction in Koreatown

30:40.239 --> 30:44.042
had a direct impact
on their lives.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.576
The Chos watched from home

30:45.577 --> 30:49.047
as the chaos unfolded on TV.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.949
After the riots, Jim
Choe wrote a letter

30:50.950 --> 30:54.319
to the editor that published
in the L.A. Times.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.822
I am extremely angry
with the LAPD

30:57.823 --> 31:00.558
for their outrageous action.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.928
While the cops let looters

31:02.929 --> 31:08.967
run wild and rape our city,
they somehow had time to

31:08.968 --> 31:13.905
bother Korean shop owners
guarding their stores.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.107
How can the owner of a business

31:16.108 --> 31:18.409
just sit back and watch his

31:18.410 --> 31:22.414
life be burned to the ground?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.584
David would have a
different reaction.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.354
My brother stole a car,
and we went into, like,

31:29.355 --> 31:30.455
all the neighborhoods and

31:30.456 --> 31:34.125
then quickly realized it
wasn't, like, about race.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.793
It was just about
people stealing stuff.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.795
And-but we were out looting.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.964
We were causing chaos.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.332
And, you know, I don't think
we got anything good.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.533
I think I got a TV stand.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.435
Was it life-changing for you?

31:44.436 --> 31:45.536
It's like you grow up and

31:45.537 --> 31:47.772
you things are explained to you.

31:47.773 --> 31:48.707
Like, here's the police.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.541
They're not doing anything
they're supposed to do.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.842
There's just, like, normal men

31:51.843 --> 31:53.178
and women of society just, like,

31:53.179 --> 31:54.645
acting like animals.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.847
And I was like, "Oh,
everything I've,

31:56.848 --> 31:58.683
like, been taught and-and

31:58.684 --> 31:59.985
learned my whole life is just

31:59.986 --> 32:01.953
disintegrating before my eyes."

32:01.954 --> 32:04.222
But, in the end, we're-you

32:04.223 --> 32:07.292
know, from great disasters
come great things, right?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.027
I mean, Koreatown burned down.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.129
But it's like we own L.A. now.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.297
It's, like, half of L.A.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.699
Now it's Korean culture.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.469
K-pop and Psy all over the world

32:18.470 --> 32:20.071
influence, you know?

32:20.072 --> 32:20.973
The filmmakers.

32:20.974 --> 32:22.974
All the-all the top, uh,
Korean filmmakers are in

32:22.975 --> 32:23.975
Hollywood.

32:23.976 --> 32:24.710
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.710
Korean, uh, culture.

32:26.078 --> 32:26.712
What about me?

32:26.712 --> 32:27.646
Yeah, you.

32:27.647 --> 32:28.879
Artists, right.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.381
Yeah, right. Yeah.

32:29.381 --> 32:29.982
Except you.

32:29.982 --> 32:30.816
Sorry.

32:30.817 --> 32:32.683
Sorry, David.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.086
It's incredible.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.324
Today, I went into
all the ways...

32:39.325 --> 32:39.891
Different ways you guys used

32:39.892 --> 32:41.226
to beat us when we were kids.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.594
The stress positions,
like, you know.

32:43.595 --> 32:44.363
Yeah, but what.

32:44.364 --> 32:45.430
All the Korean punishments.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.932
What's remarkable to
me is that every kid.

32:47.933 --> 32:48.567
Right.

32:48.568 --> 32:49.667
I mean, all Korean kids.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.735
Yeah, all Korean kids.

32:50.736 --> 32:51.902
The same position.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.338
Holding-you either hold a book.

32:53.339 --> 32:53.939
Oh, yeah.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.073
That's the way we learn from

32:55.074 --> 32:56.841
the generation to generation.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.209
We don't know why.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.710
To take a peek into the dark

32:59.711 --> 33:01.446
heart of the Korean psyche,

33:01.447 --> 33:04.449
maybe it helps to get
familiar with Han.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.285
It's a concept that,
for non-Koreans,

33:07.286 --> 33:09.787
can be difficult to fully grasp.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.022
All right.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.523
You want it? Here we go.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.426
Han denotes a collective
feeling of oppression and

33:15.427 --> 33:17.762
isolation in the face
of overwhelming odds.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.430
It connotes aspects of lament

33:19.431 --> 33:21.799
and unavenged injustice.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.933
Wow.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.802
In some occasions,
anthropologists have recognized

33:24.803 --> 33:27.705
Han as cultural-specific
medical condition.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.475
Someone who dies
of Han is... Right.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.543
Is said to have died of

33:35.114 --> 33:36.281
It's a heartburn.

33:36.282 --> 33:36.882
It's a heartburn.

33:36.883 --> 33:39.084
Wow. I mean, the-uh,
it's been described to

33:39.085 --> 33:40.718
me in a way that made
it sound benign.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.253
That-this is a burning, uh,

33:42.254 --> 33:44.455
sense of injustice, besiegement,

33:44.456 --> 33:46.624
and-and desire for revenge.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.460
The Han is the reason why,
like, we are who we are.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.795
But it's also the same reason

33:50.796 --> 33:53.098
why I won't marry
a Korean woman.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.999
No. You never know.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.567
No, I know, Mom.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.271
He's cute.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.617
Main drag of K-Town.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.320
Another mini mall among many.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.987
Karaoke?

34:16.987 --> 34:17.656
No.

34:17.657 --> 34:19.857
This is the best
dumpling spot in town.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.326
My mom would just order all

34:21.327 --> 34:22.327
these dumplings and just, like,

34:22.328 --> 34:23.360
leave 'em on my door, 'cause,

34:23.362 --> 34:25.161
uh, she's not allowed in my house.
And then...

34:25.831 --> 34:27.864
I just said, uh, "Where
are you getting these?"

34:27.866 --> 34:29.634
You know, my mom likes
to withhold information.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.536
So, I finally got it out of her.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.505
Myung In Dumplings,
where they serve a mix

34:34.505 --> 34:37.975
between Korean and Chinese.

34:37.976 --> 34:42.012
Each plate handmade
to order, my friends.

34:42.013 --> 34:45.150
Opened in 2007 on
Olympic Boulevard,

34:45.150 --> 34:47.851
it's run by Yu Jin,
a Korean by way of

34:47.853 --> 34:50.456
Shenyang Province in China.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.192
Been coming here for
about two years now.

34:54.193 --> 34:54.993
Uh huh?

34:54.994 --> 34:56.194
There's no one ever in here.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.362
Every time I've ever come

34:57.363 --> 34:59.397
in-and, uh, I don't
understand how they're open.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.132
They're the best
dumplings I've ever had.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.367
Maybe people just get 'em to go.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.668
Right.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.537
They all look like
buttholes, actually.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.874
But... Kind of. Yeah,
pre-prolapse.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.411
Wang mandu.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.745
King dumpling.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.848
Thick dough, stuffed to
the gills with pork,

35:17.849 --> 35:20.050
kimchi, and vegetables.

35:20.051 --> 35:24.822
Precisely made,
weighed, and crimped.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.591
Steamed until soft.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.592
Eat.

35:27.593 --> 35:28.726
Wow.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.761
That's nearly the
size of your head.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.530
Yeah, you know, it's like pizza.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.265
I'll eat 'em cold, too.

35:33.265 --> 35:33.832
Right.

35:33.833 --> 35:35.733
Save two and have
'em for dinner.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.067
And mandu.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.604
Smaller, with thinner
dumpling skins,

35:39.605 --> 35:42.541
served with red chili paste.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.376
Those are the dessert ones.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.111
Those got red bean in it.

35:46.112 --> 35:47.313
Oh, God. Wow.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.850
Oh, these are delicious.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.785
These are just, like, so huge.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.786
Go for it.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.261
So, would this be classically
post-drinking food or

36:03.262 --> 36:04.463
pre-drinking food?

36:05.397 --> 36:06.897
Lay down a base of
absorbent material?

36:06.898 --> 36:08.866
Yeah, I mean, there's
a lot of bread here.

36:08.867 --> 36:09.601
But I've already drank.

36:09.602 --> 36:12.237
I'm just, uh, falling under
peer pressure right now.

36:12.238 --> 36:15.574
I'll be one of the
cool guys, so.

36:21.146 --> 36:22.447
I like this place already.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.114
Good signage. It's important.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.716
Yeah. The sign's awesome.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.319
If that sign does
not sing to you,

36:28.320 --> 36:29.887
then we cannot be friends.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.422
Mari, hi.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.457
Hi, David. How are you?

36:32.458 --> 36:33.458
This is my Uncle Tony.

36:33.459 --> 36:34.393
This is Mari.

36:34.394 --> 36:35.826
How you doing?

36:35.827 --> 36:38.963
This is, uh, Harry
Kim, aka Guam Cruise.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.431
Here's more Koreans right here.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.300
Here's more Koreans.

36:41.301 --> 36:43.934
Some friends of Cho seem
to favor this place.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.437
They are a thirsty
and diverse bunch.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.472
I'm asking everybody:

36:47.473 --> 36:48.973
stress position as a child?

36:48.974 --> 36:51.175
Did you have to do the,
uh, knees forward?

36:51.176 --> 36:52.977
Oh, you know about this.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.078
It went right into it.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.246
Stress positions?

36:55.247 --> 36:56.314
Oh, we did that.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.482
You did that? See?

36:57.483 --> 36:58.284
There's this.

36:58.284 --> 36:58.950
There's this, too.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.751
The speed with which they
assume the position.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.987
You had to hold a bucket
over your head with water.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.021
Water? Wow.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.823
What if your arms get tired?

37:05.824 --> 37:06.957
They make you do it again

37:06.958 --> 37:09.159
another 45 minutes to
an hour, you know?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.495
The whole thing is
doing it again.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.029
Look, I'm not Korean.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.097
I'm not Asian.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.799
I'm a white boy from the suburb.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.867
But I noticed something
over time in my K-Town

37:16.868 --> 37:17.836
adventure.

37:17.837 --> 37:20.004
Similar anecdotes,
you might say.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.272
You know, they've done
this quite a bit.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.707
So they came up with a new one.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.542
I was very aware that all my

37:23.543 --> 37:24.975
Korean friends-no matter how

37:24.976 --> 37:26.711
creative or successful-seem

37:26.712 --> 37:29.280
strangely haunted by something.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.148
But I never knew this.

37:31.149 --> 37:31.583
How do you do it?

37:31.584 --> 37:33.784
Oh, the... It goes
up the ass like this,

37:33.785 --> 37:36.020
and then-it's like opening up

37:36.021 --> 37:37.488
a umbrella inside someone.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.789
You do this to your friends?

37:38.790 --> 37:39.691
Or college.

37:39.691 --> 37:40.392
Or college.

37:40.393 --> 37:41.459
They think it's hilarious.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.394
And adults do that
shit to each other.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.130
What the hell that's
about, I can only guess.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.965
Cheers... Cheers.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.200
Koreans gone bad.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.704
You're Korean now, officially.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.223
Pretty much any Korean
you meet anywhere,

38:13.224 --> 38:15.660
you can take it for
granted they like food,

38:15.661 --> 38:17.194
that they're passionate about

38:17.195 --> 38:18.763
food, particularly their food,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.197
which of all the immigrant

38:20.198 --> 38:23.401
cuisines has probably been
messed with the least.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.336
Unlike many other new arrivals,

38:25.337 --> 38:27.071
Koreans seem to have been the

38:27.072 --> 38:30.240
most unwilling to
accommodate Western tastes,

38:30.241 --> 38:31.376
Maybe that's why it took us so

38:31.377 --> 38:33.778
much time to love the stuff.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.947
Beverly Tofu House, like
so many of K-Town's

38:36.948 --> 38:39.884
finer establishments, is
tucked away in the corner

38:39.885 --> 38:41.386
of a strip mall.

38:41.387 --> 38:42.953
This is one of my
favorite spots.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.755
This is where I've been
coming for almost 20 years.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.890
This is a soup that's just,

38:45.891 --> 38:48.793
like-it's kind of Korean,
but its really more L.A.,

38:48.794 --> 38:49.461
and so.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.796
So this is not a direct
transplant from Korea?

38:51.797 --> 38:54.465
It became what we're about
to have here in L.A.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.466
Interesting.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.701
They're different because of

38:56.702 --> 38:58.569
the ingredients
we couldn't find.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.137
Right.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.105
But never thinking about

39:00.106 --> 39:01.939
pleasing the American palate,

39:01.940 --> 39:03.941
just to make ourselves happy.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.811
Soondubu is the thing to get.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.379
A fiery, tongue-searing,

39:08.380 --> 39:10.415
ass-burning tofu soup that'll

39:10.416 --> 39:12.450
make you forget every bad thing

39:12.451 --> 39:14.985
you ever thought about tofu.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.423
A spicy, spicy red broth
and tofu are the base.

39:18.424 --> 39:21.291
We're talking soft tofu
here, with the texture of,

39:21.292 --> 39:22.593
like, burrata.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.629
From there, you got a
handful of variations.

39:24.630 --> 39:25.763
But the most common is with

39:25.764 --> 39:27.565
kimchi and a bit of everything.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.468
Beef, oysters, mussels, clams.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.102
Oh, and tableside?

39:32.103 --> 39:33.638
They crack an egg in there.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.440
Wow.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.074
Right in there. Cool.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.477
That looks completely awesome.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.812
Well, we-we better
wait for this to cool,

39:41.813 --> 39:42.947
I'm guessing?

39:42.948 --> 39:44.148
Yeah.

39:44.149 --> 39:44.950
So, how do we eat this?

39:44.950 --> 39:45.517
We just spoon it over rice?

39:45.518 --> 39:47.752
Uh, yeah, yeah,
spoon it over rice.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.787
Mix it in.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.656
Mm. That's good.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.823
Mm.

39:52.824 --> 39:53.991
Yeah, all tofu should be spicy,

39:53.992 --> 39:56.026
by my way of thinking.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.027
It's so good.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.296
Yeah. It's really good.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.330
Koreans can well remember

40:00.331 --> 40:01.666
when nobody was interested in

40:01.667 --> 40:04.101
their food. was interested
in Now it's confusingly

40:04.102 --> 40:05.603
au courant.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.104
Must be strange for the owners,

40:07.105 --> 40:08.172
who've just been doing what

40:08.173 --> 40:10.340
they've been doing for years.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.176
Like, for example, like,
us sitting here like this,

40:12.177 --> 40:14.144
the questions a lot of people

40:14.145 --> 40:15.613
are asking me in Korean, like,

40:15.614 --> 40:17.448
I'm telling them we're filming,

40:17.449 --> 40:20.451
you know, we're trying to
show a piece of Koreatown.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.352
The-the number one
question is they're not mad

40:22.353 --> 40:24.321
or vindictive is, "Why?"

40:24.322 --> 40:25.290
It's still, "Why?"

40:25.291 --> 40:26.491
Like, why.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.358
Why would we be interested?

40:27.358 --> 40:28.226
Why would we be interested?

40:28.227 --> 40:29.694
Why would you waste your time?

40:29.695 --> 40:31.161
There's other things to do.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.030
It's an extraordinarily

40:32.031 --> 40:33.330
beautiful and delicious thing.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.499
But, see, that's the thing,

40:34.500 --> 40:37.401
is the beauty is just
already a given.

40:37.402 --> 40:39.036
It's already a part
of the fabric.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.539
So it's like, you know,
why congratulate you?

40:41.540 --> 40:42.540
You know?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.374
There's no reason to
congratulate you,

40:44.375 --> 40:45.409
because this is like what we do.

40:45.410 --> 40:46.577
That sounds awful, honestly.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.579
That sounds, like, totally joy.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.548
It's, like, totally joyless.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.017
Yeah.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.851
Uh, what do your parents
want you to be when

40:53.852 --> 40:55.252
you grow up?

40:55.253 --> 40:57.722
For me, a doctor or lawyer.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.590
Right. You're obviously
not a doctor or a lawyer.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.559
Did you finish college?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.826
I finished college and I went

41:01.827 --> 41:03.594
to one year of law
school and I walked out.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.395
Right. So, you're a bad Korean.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.264
Yeah, I'm a bad Korean.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.099
If I was a mediocre accountant,

41:09.100 --> 41:11.435
it'd be better than
being a top chef.

41:11.436 --> 41:12.903
Uh, according to who?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.238
According to Korean culture.

41:14.239 --> 41:14.773
Right.

41:14.774 --> 41:17.041
According to Korean
uncles and aunts.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.743
And it's just-it
doesn't register that

41:18.744 --> 41:19.844
that is a profession.

41:19.845 --> 41:20.746
You know?

41:20.746 --> 41:21.713
I wouldn't have to explain

41:21.714 --> 41:23.748
myself if I just
said I was a CPA.

41:23.749 --> 41:24.583
Right.

41:24.584 --> 41:28.085
Never. You know, That's-that's.
..that's weird...

41:28.086 --> 41:30.120
I know. You still got
some 'splaining to do.

41:30.121 --> 41:34.424
Still. To just get it across
that I... that I cook,

41:34.425 --> 41:35.593
and that there was this

41:35.594 --> 41:36.461
phenomenon that happened on the

41:36.462 --> 41:38.228
streets of L.A. that changed

41:38.229 --> 41:42.199
and opened up Korean
culture to-to the world.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.468
What does it mean to
be Korean American?

41:44.469 --> 41:46.537
Does one create one's own world?

41:46.538 --> 41:47.438
I don't know that I'm any

41:47.439 --> 41:49.306
smarter about that now than

41:49.307 --> 41:50.641
when I first came to K-Town

41:50.642 --> 41:52.877
in the middle of the night
and discovered a strange

41:52.878 --> 41:54.612
and fabulous and delicious

41:54.613 --> 41:57.615
slice of America I'd
never known was there.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.686
But I'm trying to figure it out.
