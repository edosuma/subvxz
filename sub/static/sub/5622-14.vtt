<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man On Earth.

00:02.536 --> 00:05.804
We were known as KWA,
Knitters with Attitude.

I'm a grand--
I'm a grandfather?

<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.284 --> 00:21.487
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...
I can't believe I'm sterile.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.456
I've been having sex all day
with both Melissa and Gail.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.557
(moaning)

00:25.559 --> 00:26.658
(moaning)

00:26.660 --> 00:29.194
Before Phil died,
he told me

00:29.196 --> 00:30.863
that he wanted you

00:30.865 --> 00:32.931
to help be the father
to the baby.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.667
You monster!

00:35.669 --> 00:37.302
(yelling)

00:37.304 --> 00:37.903
Look!

00:39.839 --> 00:41.006
(grunts)

00:41.008 --> 00:42.207
(all gasping)

00:42.209 --> 00:43.642
(grunts)

00:44.744 --> 00:47.579
You have the nerve to show
your face around here.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.882
What is your problem,
you friggin' turd.

00:49.884 --> 00:50.983
Oh, come on.

00:50.985 --> 00:52.684
Don't play dumb
with me, you dong.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.586
She was my frigging
girlfriend.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.687
Whoa, hold on a second.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.322
Are you talking
about Christine?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.591
I come down from space,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.827
after everyone in the
whole world has died,

01:01.829 --> 01:03.662
and you're talking
about Christine?!

01:03.664 --> 01:05.431
I'm talking about Christine.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.099
She wasn't your girlfriend.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.200
I loved her!

01:08.202 --> 01:10.903
I called dibs
and you know it.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.738
Stop!
Stop!

01:12.740 --> 01:13.839
Sand!
I'm not hungry.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.840
Eat some frigging sand.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.841
No, no.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.509
Eat it.
(spitting)

01:17.511 --> 01:18.710
Eat it.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.412
MIKE:
Let go of me, stop it.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.713
I am sorry.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.715
Phil, I'm sorry, okay?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.918
I had no idea you were
still hanging on to this.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.786
I am not hanging
on to anything.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.054
For the last three years,

01:29.056 --> 01:30.689
I have been stuck up there,

01:30.691 --> 01:32.691
and all I have thought about
is you.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.627
And now I'm here.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.863
And we're together.

01:37.865 --> 01:41.300
We shouldn't be fighting.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.435
We're supposed
to be celebrating.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.736
This is a miracle.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.638
This is amazing.
Right?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.941
(crying):
I'm so sorry.

01:49.876 --> 01:50.876
I'm sorry.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.077
I'm sorry.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.779
(both crying)

01:57.650 --> 01:59.451
Hey, guys,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.787
this is my little
brother, Mike.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.625
(crying):
It's nice meeting you guys.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.964
MIKE:<i> So then, once I got to</i>
<i>Tucson, I-I-I went straight</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:13.265
to Phil's apartment

02:13.267 --> 02:14.900
and it actually
smelled pretty good,

02:14.902 --> 02:16.735
so I knew this guy hadn't
been there in a while.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.071
(laughter)

02:19.073 --> 02:21.673
But I knew that if Phil
was going to stay in Tucson,

02:21.675 --> 02:23.308
he probably would have
moved to Bonita Estates.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.776
See, he had a real boner

02:24.778 --> 02:26.778
for this Arena Football League
player.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.113
You remember that?
What was his name?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.915
He used to live there, wh...?

02:29.917 --> 02:30.749
Brent Junkins.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.917
Brent Junkins,
that's right.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.752
Yeah, oh, man, he was obsessed.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.921
He used to spy on him
from across the canyon

02:35.923 --> 02:38.090
using those, those fancy,
uh, binoculars

02:38.092 --> 02:39.291
and wearing that, that, that,
that crazy outfit.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.292
What was that called?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.293
A ghillie suit.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.294
Ghillie suit, right.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.529
Oh, it's disgusting.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.930
It looked like a used mop.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.532
Or a clean-looking suit.
CAROL: We've seen it.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.767
Anyway, once I got there,
I, I found a note that said,

02:48.769 --> 02:49.868
"We're in Malibu," right?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.870
Melissa left that note for us.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.705
Well, thank God you did,

02:53.707 --> 02:54.973
'cause that's how
I ended up here.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.775
Hey, we are so glad you did.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.211
Uh, you know, I want to take
a moment to just, uh,

02:59.213 --> 03:01.880
apologize to all you guys about
that stuff on the beach earlier.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.783
Uh, you know, just so you all
know, there was this situation

03:04.785 --> 03:06.351
between Mike and I where, uh,

03:06.353 --> 03:08.187
I had liked this woman,
uh, quite a bit,

03:08.189 --> 03:10.322
yes, and uh, then Mike, uh,

03:10.324 --> 03:12.858
kind of, then went in,
and fooled around with her.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.826
Uh, fully boned her,
if I'm not mistaken.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.827
Is that, uh, would that be, uh,

03:15.829 --> 03:17.396
the way to, uh,
to characterize that?

03:18.731 --> 03:20.132
Well, I don't know
if I'd put it like that.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.133
Oh, uh, uh, sorry.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.334
Made love to?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.335
Don't know if I'd
put it like that, either.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.570
(laughs)

03:24.572 --> 03:26.572
But, uh, you know,
somewhere in between, uh,

03:26.574 --> 03:28.874
making love
and-and boning, yeah?

03:29.842 --> 03:30.842
Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.177
Anyway, you know,

03:32.179 --> 03:33.679
I thought that I had been, uh,

03:33.681 --> 03:34.880
pretty clear with my intentions,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.014
but I, I guess not,

03:36.016 --> 03:37.849
and that's, uh,
that's on me, of course.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.818
And then, you know, uh, uh,
Mike uh, you know,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.987
kind of cowardly went up into,
uh, space after that.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.489
We didn't get a chance
to resolve that, uh,

03:44.491 --> 03:46.792
but, uh, you know, thank God
you're, you're here now.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.027
To resolved issues.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.195
Hear, hear.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.597
Cheers.
Cheers.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.198
Cheers, cheers,
cheers, cheers.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.934
I want to hear more
about this space stuff.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.869
Yeah, you know, I was mostly
there just to do research.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.405
Yeah, but I... still, you went
to space, you know?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.773
(all laughing)

04:01.775 --> 04:03.508
Yeah, no, I did, but I mean,
so did chimps, right?

04:03.510 --> 04:04.676
Huh?
(laughter)

04:04.678 --> 04:05.844
Being modest.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.846
You know,
and speaking of hairy animals,

04:07.848 --> 04:09.281
what's with the beard,
Sasquatch?

04:09.283 --> 04:11.950
It's, uh, just, uh...
Hey, I think
Tandy's beard is sexy.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.085
Thank you, Carol.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.686
And why is everybody
using your middle name?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.788
Wh... uh, funny story,
tragic story.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.856
You know,
I'm surprised that people

04:17.858 --> 04:19.057
aren't calling you
by your nickname.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.861
(laughs)
Well, that was, uh,
a long time ago.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.429
And what was Tandy's nickname?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.898
Nobody wants to know about that.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.600
I don't know if I should,
I don't...

04:28.602 --> 04:29.868
(all encouraging)

04:29.870 --> 04:30.969
Skidmark.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.871
(exclaiming, laughter)
Skidmark.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.439
Skidmark.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.308
Right?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.643
Ah, yeah, yeah.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.944
Yeah, my underwear were

04:38.946 --> 04:40.646
so clean they went
the other way with it.

04:40.648 --> 04:44.116
Oh, yeah, that's why people
called you Skidmark, sure, yeah.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.085
I'd appreciate it if we'd
refrain from using that.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.554
You got it, Skidmark.
(laughter)

04:49.556 --> 04:51.556
Uh-oh.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.091
And so it begins.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.093
You snuck it in there.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.561
(feigns laugher)

04:56.563 --> 04:58.030
Oh, God.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.141
Listen, all that stuff
I said at the beach,

05:09.143 --> 05:11.677
please, just forget I said it.

05:11.679 --> 05:15.781
Yeah, you were all over
the place on that one.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.949
Probably, you
should have told me

05:17.951 --> 05:20.118
about Melissa privately.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.753
And you know, the whole
"Big Love" thing,

05:21.755 --> 05:24.256
that was maybe not
the best recovery.

05:24.258 --> 05:25.257
No, I see that now.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.525
Uh, big whiff.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.659
Total misfire.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.462
Just please know
how sorry I am.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.097
You guys talking about
Todd's proposal?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.131
Yup.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.301
Yeah, no, I wa...
I was just telling Gail,

05:36.303 --> 05:38.170
big whiff, total misfire.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.171
You think?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.006
Yeah.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.442
All right,
see you later.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.183
Just so you know,
I don't think I'm going to be up

05:51.185 --> 05:52.551
for your four-way.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.187
Yeah, I'm not getting
any takers on that, so...

05:55.189 --> 05:56.355
Yeah, well, when you say,

05:56.357 --> 05:57.956
"Will you marry me?" to someone,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.291
and then the other person says,

05:59.293 --> 06:01.126
"No, but do you want to be
in a four-way with me?"

06:01.128 --> 06:02.627
I mean...
Yeah, no.

06:02.629 --> 06:05.197
Big misfire, whiff.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.365
Yeah.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.399
(clattering)

06:07.401 --> 06:09.501
See you around, Casanova.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.470
Right on.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.406
Well, we ran out of blankets,

06:14.408 --> 06:16.007
but I was able to find
a towel in the hamper.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.075
Oh, that's fine.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.510
Yeah.

06:18.512 --> 06:22.080
Thanks so much for understanding
the whole lodging situation.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.716
You know, it would just be weird
for you to stay in Phil's room.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.218
You know, it's kind
of a shrine right now.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.853
Hey, I get it.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.521
I don't want to muck
anything up, you know?

06:29.523 --> 06:30.722
Yeah, and of course,

06:30.724 --> 06:31.923
that couch is taken 'cause

06:31.925 --> 06:33.592
Todd called dibs on
that a while back.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.160
You know about dibs, right?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.529
You know, when someone calls for
something, you can't have it?

06:37.531 --> 06:39.331
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.333
You sure there's nowhere else
inside that I could sleep?

06:41.335 --> 06:42.734
No, you know nothing

06:42.736 --> 06:44.002
with a view of the stars,
at least.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.737
You know, and since I know
how much you like to talk

06:45.739 --> 06:47.572
about space and stuff
all the time,

06:47.574 --> 06:48.740
I thought that, you know,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.542
this would probably be
the best fit for you.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.244
Yeah, night-night.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.245
Burn.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.746
Good night, Skidmark.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.650
Good night.

07:03.022 --> 07:07.092
CAROL:
Hey, there's my
sexy Skidmark.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.226
Carol, please.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.228
You must be

07:10.230 --> 07:12.063
so happy that
your brother's here.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.232
Oh, over the friggin' moon.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.700
Well, it looks like

07:15.702 --> 07:17.269
our family's already
growing, huh?

07:17.271 --> 07:18.770
I always pictured it'd be

07:18.772 --> 07:20.639
with a baby instead
of an adult man,

07:20.641 --> 07:23.208
but, wow, God's plan,
you know?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.043
I'm so sorry.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.244
In all the excitement,

07:26.246 --> 07:28.280
we never got a chance
to talk about my balls.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.082
Now look, I know how
badly you wanted this.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.251
I'm, I'm sorry that
I'm shooting blanks.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.220
Na-huh. Don't you
be sorry about that,

07:35.222 --> 07:38.490
because maybe I'm shooting
blanks, too, huh?

07:38.492 --> 07:40.892
Maybe we're a couple of
Hollywood stunt people,

07:40.894 --> 07:42.260
just shooting blanks.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.795
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.796
Carol,

07:44.798 --> 07:46.097
I'm sure you're
very fertile.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.266
I mean, you have
so many periods.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.267
I do.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.002
I'm the problem here.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.437
You're never the problem.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.072
I mean, you are the
problem, sometimes,

07:54.074 --> 07:55.941
but not in this, okay?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.609
Listen, Skid,

07:57.611 --> 08:00.512
I did not marry you so we
could have a baby together.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.747
I did the first time,

08:02.749 --> 08:05.517
but not the
second time, okay?

08:05.519 --> 08:07.986
I married you 'cause
I want to be with you.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.022
You're the bee's knees.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.958
You're the bee's knees,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.160
and the femur,
and the gastrocnemius,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.329
and the whole
bee leg region.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.964
Why don't you come

08:18.966 --> 08:21.266
over here and give
me a little sting?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.134
Little sting?
Carol.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.171
Okay, almost
average size sting.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.906
Thank you.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.043
MIKE:
<i>Well, so then I was like,</i>
<i>wait a second,</i>

08:32.045 --> 08:33.645
if this is the American flag,

08:33.647 --> 08:36.314
then, I think I put my pants
on that asteroid.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.516
No!

08:37.518 --> 08:39.317
(laughter)

08:39.319 --> 08:41.186
It's so great being
around people again.
OTHERS: Aw.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.554

I know that's...

Hello, Skidmark.
(laughs)

08:45.526 --> 08:46.558
How's that Skidmark.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.293
Good morning, Phil,
how are you?

08:48.295 --> 08:49.327
Good morning.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.562
How the heck did you sleep, bud?

08:50.564 --> 08:51.696
Uh, out there?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.532
Um, yeah, yeah, I mean, okay.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.233
I think I'm just still
on space time.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.369
Oh.
(others laughing)

08:57.371 --> 08:58.737
CAROL:
Mike, that's so funny.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.372
Oh, wait, were you up in space?

09:00.374 --> 09:02.307
Oh, I almost forgot
because I hadn't heard you

09:02.309 --> 09:03.508
mention it in, like,
five seconds.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.876
Burn.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.011
Well, maybe some of the
poop from your underwear

09:06.013 --> 09:07.078
got stuck in your ears.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.146
Burn.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.081
You know what?
I got something to show you.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.550
No, no, Tandy, stop it.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.684
Oh.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.319
Now that's where
my butt usually lays

09:14.321 --> 09:15.487
against my underwear.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.588
Look at that, huh?

09:16.590 --> 09:17.889
Do you see anything?

09:17.891 --> 09:18.990
There is nothing in here.
You're right.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.191
Look at this.
You're right.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.760
And you guys, I invite you
to look at this as well.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.094
No, we don't need to.
No, Tandy.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.229
Look at this, I'll rub
it all over my face.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.330
I'm comfortable with that,

09:25.332 --> 09:26.898
'cause I know there's
nothing on there.
Yeah.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.900
And I've been wearing these
puppies for four days straight.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.368
Oh, poor Carol.
Ugh.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.203
(stuttering)
Give or take four days.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.372
Well, that means five, huh?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.341
(laughter)

09:36.343 --> 09:38.410
Really loving this, yeah.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.278
Me, too, actually.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.613
Uh, look, hey,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.949
I know we joke around
and everything,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.584
but it's really great
to see you again.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.419
I missed you so much, Phil.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.356
Aw, geez, well,
the feeling's mutual.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.860
Come here.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.128
That's so nice.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.133
Oh, hey, I was thinking
about having a little

10:02.135 --> 10:04.202
bonfire down on the
beach later today.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.403
Why... n... why?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.439
Uh, just a way to thank you
guys for bringing me

10:07.441 --> 10:09.140
in the fold so graciously,
I just...

10:09.142 --> 10:10.809
If you guys already
have plans or something.
No, let's all do it, right?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.978
I was going to drink,
could I drink there?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.080
Not unless I drink
everything first.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.548
You better not.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.882
Okay, well then,
I'm going to go down

10:17.884 --> 10:19.250
and start setting
things up, all right?
Right.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.286
I will see you all
on the flippity.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.887

10:22.889 --> 10:25.256
"See you on the flippity."

10:25.258 --> 10:27.292

this barrel after we tap it.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.773
(barrel thuds)
Oh.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.676
Um, could we talk?

10:44.678 --> 10:47.445
Yeah, sure.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.481
I did not mean to hurt you.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.283
You know, I was in a bad way
after losing Gordon,

10:52.285 --> 10:57.088
and doing such a suck job
on Phil's appendix surgery.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.291
I was kind of nosediving.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.860
I get it.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.696
I mean, Todd's a
big teddy bear.

11:04.698 --> 11:08.600
He's a big ol' beanbag chair.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.635
Yeah, you just fall
right into him.
Yeah.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.504
Sometimes, you can't
even get back out.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.205
Yeah, he's like quicksand.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.206

Oh, um, I don't
really play, no.

I mean, I noodle a little bit.

20 years of lessons.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.509
Wh... no, that's not true.
What? It's so true.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.777
No, I took two years of lessons

12:25.779 --> 12:27.512
when I was, like,
eight years old, that's all.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.947
Well, play something, Mike.
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.515
You're playing into his hand.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.164
MIKE:
It's Queef Richards
of the Blowing Stones.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.532
GAIL: Yeah!
(laughter)

16:41.534 --> 16:42.667
Well, where have you guys been?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.701
CAROL:
Mike threw a pre-party

16:43.703 --> 16:47.038
and we got a little
preoccupied.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
I've been waiting here for,
like, three hours.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.775
Oh, sorry, Dad.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.276
(laughter)
ERICA:
What do you guys think?

16:52.278 --> 16:54.612
Should we go back
to Mike's party?
Yeah!

16:54.614 --> 16:56.547
MIKE: Ah, we could.
Wait, w-w-wait. (laughs)

16:56.549 --> 16:59.717
I can't believe you guys fell
for my old whiny, dweeb routine.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.985
I was kidding.

17:00.987 --> 17:04.155
Hey, okay, let's get this show
on the road, huh?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.723
Queef Richards, good one, bro.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.725
(chatter)

17:07.727 --> 17:09.494
I'm still getting used
to this smoke machine,

17:09.496 --> 17:11.496
but that is all right,

17:11.498 --> 17:15.833
because I'm very used
to the rock and roll machine.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.002
Hello, Los Angeles!

17:18.004 --> 17:20.004
Hey, this first one
goes out to all the

17:20.006 --> 17:21.639
survivors out there.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.208
It's a little homage to my
favorite BJ of all time.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.676
MIKE:
Brent Junkins?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.378
(laughter)

17:27.380 --> 17:29.814
(laughs)
Oh, Mike, very funny.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.849
No, an even better BJ than that,

17:31.851 --> 17:33.184
Billy Joel.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.719

You had your time yesterday.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.221
Wh...I-I-I-I'm
just screwing around,

18:10.223 --> 18:11.689
having a little fun.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.723
Look, we get it.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.026
All right,
you're cooler than me.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.861
And smarter.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.629
And funnier and more fun.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.031
And you had
a cooler job than me

18:20.033 --> 18:21.933
and you got all the ladies.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.702
Well, you're not perfect, Mike.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.871
Okay, you got your faults.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.739
Yeah, you're so vain.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.475
Yeah, tell them
about your nose job.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.543
I didn't have a nose job.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.745
I broke my nose and had
to have surgery to fix it.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.880
That's all he's talking about.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.482
Well, it sounds like
a nose job to me.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.883
Yeah, well tomato, to-mah-to.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.787
Or how about, how about your
senior thesis, huh?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.156
Perfect Mike here
had to switch colleges

18:45.158 --> 18:47.291
'cause he got busted
for plagiarism.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.895
Uh, yeah, no, th...
th... that's true.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.296
Not lyin' there.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.599
And how about Nana?

18:54.601 --> 18:57.101
Oh, my God.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.103
Our grandmother was dying,

18:59.105 --> 19:00.805
and our whole family
was with her,

19:00.807 --> 19:03.474
and this guy went
on a kayaking trip.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.611
Yeah, well, you know,
uh, you're right.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.079
No, I wasn't there.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.615
Well, I was.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.283
(grunts)

19:12.285 --> 19:15.319
Okay, I think
I'm going to go home.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.821
I'm going to go home.
(overlapping chattering)

19:16.823 --> 19:17.955
No, no, no, no.
Hey, no, it's all right.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.690
I'm okay, I'm, I'm,
I'm going to go home.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.858
I'm going to go home.
Burn.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.693
Yeah. Good burn.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.295
Looks like we're even now.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.865
No, no, we're pretty far
from even, bud.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.801
What a square, huh?
(laughs)

19:30.803 --> 19:32.803
We're all circles, huh?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.805
ERICA:
I'm, I'm tired and it's time.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.975
What? Don't let this sourpuss
bring down the party.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.644
ERICA: Yeah, that was
all you, dude.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.811
Where you going?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.680
It's a frigging party.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.352
CAROL:<i> This is crazy.</i>

19:48.354 --> 19:49.820
You owe your
brother an apology.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.356
I owe him an apology?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.225
He came all the way
down from space

19:54.227 --> 19:56.661
and you've been nothing
but mean to him.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.897
I welcomed him
into my own home.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.732
Stop lying to yourself.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.236
Look, don't you see
how lucky you are?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.004
You are the
only two people

20:07.006 --> 20:08.906
in this entire world
that have family.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.142
Whatever problems
you had in the past,

20:11.144 --> 20:12.410
why don't you
just leave it

20:12.412 --> 20:14.345
in the old world
where it belongs?

20:14.347 --> 20:15.680
You're his big brother,

20:15.682 --> 20:17.982
so why don't you
start acting like it?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.050
You're right.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.352
He's my little brother.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.853
He needs my guidance.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.423
My ropes showing.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.959
I'm going to go apologize to him
first thing in the morning.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.928
That's my Tandy.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.299
(machine whooshing rhythmically)

20:54.886 --> 20:58.589
What in heaven's name?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.524
Mike.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.892
MELISSA: All kinds of crazy.
Yeah.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.461
Everyone was like, oh, I want
just the elliptical machine.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.528
Mike?

21:07.899 --> 21:10.234
Oh, my God.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.069
Hey, Phil.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.538
Know anything about, uh, this?

21:14.540 --> 21:18.042
Hmm. Burn?
