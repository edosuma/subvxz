WEBVTT

00:42.751 --> 00:45.170
I like church. It's cozy.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.005
Of course you do.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.425
Inside are candles, red wine
and cushions. It's basically our flat.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.846
Erica looks well.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.681
That woman's Beyoncé to me, Jason.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.183
Comes out of a marriage breakup stronger

00:58.267 --> 01:00.352
and without once dragging me
to a yoga retreat.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.895
Do you know how hard that is?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.480
Come on. Let's go.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.069
-Why're you wearing canvas shoes?
-Oh, yeah.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.239
Well, I tried to
not overthink it, all right?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.867
-Then I've ended up underthinking it.
-It's not very godparenty, is it?

01:14.950 --> 01:17.077
It's difficult to think about things
the exact right amount.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.037
Anyway, don't worry. No one will notice.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.956
See you in a bit.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.542
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, fine.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.587
-Why is Jason wearing those shoes?
-I do not know.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.720
-Okay, should we--
-Should we just pop inside?

01:34.803 --> 01:35.804
-Yes.
-Yeah.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.599
No, no, it's fine, it's fine.
I don't care who he dates.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.811
-She's very pretty.
-No.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.229
It's too early to tell.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.231
Everyone's hot when they're 27.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.400
We won't know for sure until she's 35.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.987
Yeah, what do they talk about?
What has she done?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.448
Women under 30
don't do anything except juice.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.159
-And tell people they're bisexual.
-Very true.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.203
We're just gonna keep it simple.

01:59.912 --> 02:03.999
People who obsess over the wedding day
are just trying to cover up the cracks.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.878
Like, if the relationship's a six,
the day has to be a ten, you know.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.339
-Exactly, don't overthink it. Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.884
-How are you, mate? You all right?
-Writing more long form now.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.469
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.222
Doctor told me to keep a food diary
last month,

02:18.305 --> 02:21.141
and I just, I really leant into it,
you know. Found my voice.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.685
And an allergy to soy.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.564
Yeah, so that's me, trying to crack
the Great American Novel for my sins.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.650
But you're English, mate.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.568
I think it gives me a unique perspective.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.987
-Glad you made it.
-Yeah.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.405
Lovely to see you.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.080
-When's he moving out?
-Tonight.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.583
I lasted six weeks. Erica,
I have no idea how you did 12 years.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.460
Humans are resilient. Mandela did 27.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.879
Yeah, not with Freddy he didn't.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.736
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

03:14.820 --> 03:18.866
the love of God and the fellowship
of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.909
And also with you.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.454
-Father, we ask you to bless this water--
-Hey.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.000
Why don't we bring your girlfriend back?
Because he could do her while we're here.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.418
-Can we not?
-Not what?

03:29.501 --> 03:30.752
Be that cliché.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.880
Says the midlife crisis
wearing a friendship bracelet.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.798
-…Christ, our Lord, amen.
-Amen.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.425
-Amen.
-Amen.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.344
Freddy and Erica, do you receive
this child as a gift from God?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.596
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.472
Do you wish to give thanks to God
and seek his blessing?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.599
-Yes.
-Yes.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.934
Do you acknowledge this day
that God's love is already at work?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.352
Mate, we're not really religious,

03:47.436 --> 03:50.647
so if you wanna just cycle forward
to the water bit, that'd be great.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.693
What name have you chosen for this child?

03:54.776 --> 03:55.861
-Samuel.
-Buster.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.821
-What?
-Buster.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.657
-His name is Samuel.
-Nope, it's not. I changed my mind.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.243
You can't change your mind.
He's named after my grandfather.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.370
I never liked your grandfather, so…

04:10.918 --> 04:13.128
Together,
the Christian community welcomes…

04:13.795 --> 04:15.255
-Samuel Turner.
-Buster Turner.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.339
Oh, my God.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.843
Okay, guys, I'm not sure
this is the ideal place for this.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.094
I'm not naming him Sam.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.055
-I'm not naming him Buster.
-Why not?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.599
Because he's not a talking bus
in a children's cartoon.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.644
Yeah, this really does sound
more like a pre-font sort of chat.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.812
What about a little compromise?
What about Stan?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.314
-'Cause that's got letters from each.
-No.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.775
Marlon.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.401
Stan and Marlon?
That's the first two on your list, Jason?

04:36.485 --> 04:37.736
I don't know. I'm panicking.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.156
-Luke?
-It's just a sound really, isn't it?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.451
John? Just-- Paul? George?
I'm just doing Beatles now.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.953
-Parker.
-No.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.663
-Why not?
-Because he's not a wealthy murderer.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.081
Joh-- I don't-- George.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.500
I'm back on Beatles again, aren't I?
Christ. Sorry.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.210
-What's your name?
-My name?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.962
-Yeah, your name. Yeah.
-Thomas.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.381
-Thomas.
-I like that actually.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.966
-Yeah?
-Little Tommy.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.592
Thomas Turner.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.262
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

05:03.971 --> 05:04.972
Great.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.936
Thomas Turner, I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

05:11.687 --> 05:13.021
and of the Son…

05:14.231 --> 05:16.024
and of the Holy Spirit.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.610
-Amen.
-Amen.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.779
-Amen.
-Namaste.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.326
You can't rename a child out of spite.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.413
Okay, you cheat on your wife,
she might rename a kid or two.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.081
It is the risk that you take.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.585
Actually, Nikki, from an evolutionary
perspective, monogamy is really--

05:34.668 --> 05:37.838
Okay, stop. I'm not absolving you
of your sins, okay?

05:37.921 --> 05:39.590
I'm not the women's pope.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.508
Well, I actually have a…

05:41.592 --> 05:43.343
a very interesting article on bonobos--

05:43.427 --> 05:45.262
Freddy, we've got Penny here in five,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.139
and I need this not to be happening, okay?

05:47.222 --> 05:48.932
We're never going to find a kid.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.058
-What?
-Ellie's gone.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.019
-You're kidding.
-She only come on the site yesterday.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.854
-What sort of a--
-They go so quickly!

05:53.937 --> 05:56.398
It's like trying
to get Glastonbury tickets.

05:56.899 --> 05:57.900
-This is you.
-What?

05:57.983 --> 05:58.984
You took too long again.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.154
Yeah, but it's difficult choosing
a child from a photograph, isn't it?

06:02.237 --> 06:03.572
You wanna get in there, kick the tires.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.992
-Jase.
-This meeting. Is it gonna be quick?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.120
What, the meeting that decides
all of our hopes and dreams

06:10.204 --> 06:12.456
and defines the rest of our lives?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.750
Yeah, it's just,
I need my stuff from Erica's,

06:14.833 --> 06:16.668
and I cannot see her right now.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.670
Sorry, you want us to get it?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.507
I just know
she's not watering my staghorn fern.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.717
-Seriously, Freddy--
-Okay. All right.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.637
Fine, we'll do it.
Can you give us a minute, please?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.473
-Thank you.
-Jase.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.226
His middle name is Ivan.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.479
Thomas Ivan Turner.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.523
His initials are "TIT."

06:38.649 --> 06:40.484
Tit, Nikki, tit.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.028
So she did name him after you then,
didn't she?

06:47.449 --> 06:49.493
I wish you'd back me up a bit.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.954
I don't like it
when you don't dislike things I dislike.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.997
You know how betrayed I felt
when you started liking olives.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.667
Yeah. And I stopped eating them, didn't I?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.585
For you, you little weirdo.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.422
Right. Okay.

07:02.506 --> 07:05.384
Hello? Okay, all right, Penny.
Come up now. Yeah.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.386
-Right.
-Do you think she's gonna tell us off

07:07.469 --> 07:08.470
for not finding a child?

07:08.554 --> 07:11.014
No. It takes a long time
to find the right one, doesn't it.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.393
Look at me. I had hundreds of girlfriends
before I met you, and…

07:14.977 --> 07:16.395
Okay.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.188
That sounded better in your head,
didn't it?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.690
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thought so.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.942
Come on.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.611
I just, I don't want this to slip by.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.572
We need something in our lives
that's bigger than us,

07:26.655 --> 07:29.116
something that will outlive us,
carry on after we've gone.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.868
We will, all right?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.662
We have loads of plastic bags
in our kitchen drawer.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.581
-All right?
-Yeah.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.291
Ready? Okay.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.585
-Hi.
-Hello.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.212
Is there CCTV on this street?

07:42.754 --> 07:44.548
No. No, I don't think there is, no.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.176
Oh, good, good. That's--

07:47.259 --> 07:48.802
No, that's good. Good, it'll be fine.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.220
-Okay.
-Okay.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.680
Anyway, I only have half an hour,

07:51.763 --> 07:56.351
because my sister and her husband are
having a naming party for her new puppy.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.606
Six months of marriage therapy,
and that's the best idea they've had.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.150
I said cut to the chase,
call it "last throw of the dice"

08:03.233 --> 08:04.526
'cause that's what it is.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.653
Tea.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.740
Anyway, it's gonna be an absolute slog

08:09.823 --> 08:11.783
because she has gone hard vegan.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.160
-Sugar?
-Oh, no, thank you.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.662
I'm sorry,
but no amount of tofu stir-fries

08:15.746 --> 08:18.373
is going to un-hit that swan
with your car last summer,

08:18.457 --> 08:21.084
so maybe just deal with the guilt head-on,
can we,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.712
and stop burying it under
a lot of spinach triangles.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.633
Long story. He was fine.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.469
It was mainly his fault. He was warned.
Right.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.807
Gather, please.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.102
-Okay.
-For I have news.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.438
I was never here.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.858
This is an illusion.
This is not happening. Okay?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.109
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.030
Okay, so, there is a boy.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.451
His name is James.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.497
He is a nice boy.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.415
Look.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.254
I think he's your boy.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.009
By means I do not wish to divulge,

09:11.093 --> 09:13.679
I have advanced knowledge
he will be on the system in 24 hours.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.182
I want us to be ready to go for him.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.725
James?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.604
James. James Newman-Ross.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.147
James Newman-Ross.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.149
"JNR." That's good. That's good.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.359
Yeah.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.237
Hi, hi. Sorry, sorry.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.533
Just to say that
she'll be doing the kids' tea from six,

09:34.616 --> 09:39.997
so absolutely no pressure, but anytime
in the next 45 minutes would be ideal.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.457
Okay?

09:47.337 --> 09:50.132
-Look at his little face.
-I know. Sweet.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.383
So exciting.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.307
How do we know
which of this stuff's Freddy's?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.767
If you can imagine a character
in a Bret Easton Ellis novel owning it,

10:00.851 --> 10:01.852
then it's his.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.025
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Fine.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.109
Yeah?

10:10.027 --> 10:12.946
-'Cause you really don't need to be.
-I'm fine.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.158
I have a plan for the new me.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.746
It's a combination of taking up running,
meditation and screwing other people.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.666
-Are you dating?
-Yeah. Maybe.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.713
I don't know. It's a lot of vagina admin,
isn't it? But I could.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.048
That's it. The car's full.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.425
He can come and
get his bloody staghorn fern later.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.887
-Does that need watering?
-It does, yeah.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.027
I can't believe we're doing this.
Have you got it?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.320
Yeah. Yeah.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.827
Why're you wearing all that?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.287
Ran out of bags.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.580
Thanks, Nikki.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.501
Thought I'd lost that.

11:14.508 --> 11:18.428
Oh, my God.
No woman would ever have two blowtorches,

11:18.512 --> 11:21.557
three different sets of things
for cracking lobsters,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.350
but no colander.

11:24.643 --> 11:28.397
-What do you think of the flat?
-I think it's like one big panic room.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.731
-Horrible, innit?
-Yeah.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.692
So, what do you think?

11:31.775 --> 11:33.193
-Gorgeous, mate.
-So lovely.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.611
-Beautiful, yeah, very--
-Yeah.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.198
'Cause sometimes things
can be too colorful, can't they?

11:38.282 --> 11:39.283
It's distracting.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.993
What are you gonna do
when the kids come over, mate?

11:41.076 --> 11:42.661
'Cause it is quite-- Sort of--

11:42.744 --> 11:44.496
I've ordered some beanbags
off the Internet

11:44.580 --> 11:46.456
and… maybe some cushions.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.375
We can sort you out
with cushions, can't we?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.752
We've got 30 or 40 spare ones
in our flat you can have, mate.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.087
Jase.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.882
Lobster crackers.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.385
Four sets.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.227
He likes football,
Nerf guns and Minecraft.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.356
And his favorite food is
a chicken fajita wrap.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.484
That makes me feel old.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.904
My favorite food when I was a kid
was fish fingers and beans.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
Yeah.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.576
What's the matter?

12:23.327 --> 12:25.037
-Nothing.
-Okay.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.164
Why you being weird then?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.708
I'm not. I'm acting completely normally.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.001
Yeah, but that's what's weird.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.754
Because normally with this sort of stuff,
you'd be all hyper.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.548
-I'm fine.
-What's going on?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.094
I don't wanna say,

12:41.178 --> 12:44.681
because if I tell you,
then that makes me a terrible person,

12:44.765 --> 12:47.768
and not being a terrible person is
the thing that I like most about myself,

12:47.851 --> 12:48.852
so…

12:57.444 --> 12:59.780
Okay, I sort of assumed
that we'd be getting a girl.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.574
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.868
I sort of thought that we decided that.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.205
No, I didn't realize we'd decided that.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.457
No, I thought that you said
that you wanted a girl

13:10.541 --> 13:12.584
because
you wanted to learn how to do the--

13:12.668 --> 13:14.336
What's it? The French plait thing.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.171
Because the guy on the bus looked cool
when he did it.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.965
The guy on the bus did look cool, but--

13:18.048 --> 13:19.800
How have we not discussed this?

13:21.385 --> 13:22.970
Are you set on a girl, yeah?

13:23.804 --> 13:25.764
Well, are you set on a boy?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.808
I'm, no-- Look, am I?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.478
If I had to choose,
then, maybe selfishly, yeah.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.146
Because, you know, because there's that,

13:33.230 --> 13:36.024
there's that special bond
between father and sons.

13:36.108 --> 13:39.278
Oh, really? How many conversations
do you have with your dad

13:39.361 --> 13:42.072
that aren't about
how to get the TV back to HDMI1?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.242
Actually, loads recently,
because he's just hurt his shoulder.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.202
So now I can ask him about that too.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.204
Jase, I just, I don't understand them.

13:49.288 --> 13:50.289
-Who? Who?
-Their choices.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.456
Men!

13:51.540 --> 13:53.166
All men? Yeah?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.960
I don't know, you--

13:55.043 --> 13:59.548
You all react weirdly to things, and
you have emotions in all the wrong places.

14:00.132 --> 14:04.136
And you watch films that are basically
an hour and a half of fast driving.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.888
You always like your hair
loads shorter than you should.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.014
What are you talking about?

14:07.097 --> 14:09.516
What am I supposed to do with a boy, Jase?

14:09.600 --> 14:12.895
Seriously. What?
Do I fill him full of confidence,

14:12.978 --> 14:16.565
or do I take some of it away because
society already fills him with confidence,

14:16.648 --> 14:19.276
so if I do it too, I'm just--
I'm gonna turn him into--

14:19.359 --> 14:20.903
-Into what?
-Freddy!

14:23.363 --> 14:25.616
That is seriously the worst-case scenario?

14:25.699 --> 14:26.992
Do you know, Jase, it's--

14:27.075 --> 14:29.661
It really scares me
that you don't hate him

14:29.745 --> 14:31.246
and what he's done as much as I do.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.415
He's my mate though, Nikki.
What am I gonna do?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.127
-And anyway, women can be dicks.
-Yeah, okay.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.213
-Myra Hindley!
-Yeah.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.215
That rude woman at the post office.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.344
Queen Mary I.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.180
Okay, three women in,
and you're back to the 16th century.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.474
I could name you
five men off tonight's news.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.351
But none of them are four-year-old boys,
are they?

14:52.434 --> 14:55.145
Yeah, no, Jase,
but they were once and then society,

14:55.229 --> 14:57.272
society just came in
and messed them all up.

14:57.356 --> 15:01.360
How can I compete with society, Jase?
It's bloody everywhere.

15:01.443 --> 15:04.071
I mean, we're the only people
that get to pick a gender.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.323
Why would we not pick the best one?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
Have this week's rankings
come out already?

15:08.492 --> 15:11.078
Sorry, I must've missed that.
This is a ridiculous conversation!

15:15.707 --> 15:17.584
-Will you get the plates?
-I'm doing it.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.962
Margaret Thatcher.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.168
Can I ask your advice?

15:59.251 --> 16:00.919
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.298
Oh, my God, that is wild.
No one has ever said that to me before.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.425
It's always like,
"Jen, no one asked your opinion.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.218
This is my wedding. Go back to your seat."

16:08.302 --> 16:09.303
Okay…

16:09.386 --> 16:12.139
But I will be honest with you, 'kay?
I won't sugarcoat it.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.016
You wouldn't want me to sugarcoat it,
would ya?

16:14.099 --> 16:16.518
Yes, I would.
When have I ever said that?

16:16.602 --> 16:19.146
-Always sugarcoat it.
-Okay, fine. Go.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.523
Well, it's about boys.

16:21.607 --> 16:25.110
Okay, they look like their worst bio photo
is a good rule of thumb,

16:25.194 --> 16:28.530
and always reply to a below-the-waist nude
within… ten minutes.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.698
Hello. What can I get you?

16:29.781 --> 16:32.826
Hi. Two falafel wraps,
one with extra pickle. Thank you.

16:32.910 --> 16:36.496
Yeah, no, raising them, not dating them.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.708
Do you think I could raise a good one?

16:43.962 --> 16:46.882
-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
-Yeah?

16:46.965 --> 16:48.509
-100%.
-Okay.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.552
Just don't let them be fussy eaters.

16:50.636 --> 16:53.096
My friend, Clayton,
only ate toast until he was 12,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.057
and now he's really into S and M.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.350
It's not a coincidence.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.810
Okay, yeah. No, that's a handy tip.

16:58.894 --> 17:02.481
And anyway, you know,
bad parents make interesting people.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.273
Joel's parents divorced when he was nine,

17:04.358 --> 17:06.859
and he's the most interesting person
I know.

17:06.944 --> 17:10.071
I mean, we can talk for hours, like,
even when we're not high.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.782
He does get quite angry at stuff.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.661
Which is wild, 'cause I'm the lowest
maintenance person in the world.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.164
I'm so low-maintenance, I might
still be going out with some people.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.916
Jen, does he sound like
he's the right person for you?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.752
Yeah, no. We're on a break at the moment.

17:24.837 --> 17:28.382
We couldn't agree what race Ariana Grande
was, and it all just sort of spiraled.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.342
-There you go, ladies. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.635
Thank you.

17:33.554 --> 17:37.224
Basically, just fill them with love,
and it'll be fine.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.977
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.979
But not too much.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.231
'Cause then they get too close
and resent all other women

17:44.314 --> 17:45.524
for not being as good.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.943
It actually happens a lot
with serial killers.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.696
Did you see that one in South Korea?
He was really handsome,

17:50.779 --> 17:52.781
which you don't really expect
in a murderer, do you?

17:52.865 --> 17:53.907
No.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.203
Has this helped?

17:59.162 --> 18:01.582
Yeah. Massively.

18:01.665 --> 18:02.499
Cool.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.309
Are we gonna talk about this or just
keep pretending you wanna buy sunglasses?

18:20.392 --> 18:22.519
I do maybe wanna buy some sunglasses.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.062
There you go.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.939
I like to have a choice.

18:26.023 --> 18:29.193
Look, who says that our boy is gonna
be boyish anyway?

18:29.902 --> 18:31.111
He might not be.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.239
Gender norms are ingrained, Jase.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.949
Erica bought Lauren a monster truck.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.619
She put it in a dress
and pushes it around in a buggy.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.746
I'm not sure how scientific
some of your arguments are.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.623
So what if a monster truck
wants to wear a dress?

18:42.706 --> 18:44.917
Good luck to him. Her. They.

18:46.752 --> 18:49.129
I wanna be a guide to our child.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.674
I wanna be wise, and offer help
and smooth their path.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.636
How can I do that if I don't know
what it's like to be a boy?

18:55.719 --> 18:57.262
You'd expect me to do that for a girl.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.181
Yeah, because girls
tell you what they're feeling.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
-They know how to ask for help.
-Do you? Bollocks.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.559
You just sit on the sofa
hugging a cushion,

19:02.643 --> 19:04.978
sighing louder and louder
until someone asks you what's wrong.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.439
Boys are uncomplicated, okay?

19:07.523 --> 19:10.442
They're just, you know, bosh,
straight lines.

19:10.526 --> 19:11.902
It's like maintaining a bit of machinery.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.363
Bit of a wipe down with a damp cloth
now and then, they're golden.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.158
-Oh, wow, another worrying opinion.
-Hello, mate.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.952
-Hello.
-How are you?

19:20.035 --> 19:22.371
Haven't seen you in ages.
What you been up to?

19:22.454 --> 19:24.206
-No staghorn fern?
-Sorry, come again?

19:24.289 --> 19:27.084
-You didn't bring my staghorn fern.
-No, we couldn't fit it in.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.002
Yeah, well, could you pop back and get it?

19:32.548 --> 19:35.217
-Are you actually being serious?
-Yeah, I've had it since uni.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.679
We spent yesterday afternoon
moving all of your stuff.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.348
Not all my stuff,
'cause I am light one staghorn fern.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.432
Wow.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.227
Go and get it yourself then.
We're not your interns, Freddy.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.312
I can't. Me and Erica aren't talking.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.648
We've got lots of stuff on ourselves,
okay?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.444
And to be honest, mate, you're acting
like a bit of a selfish dick.

19:54.528 --> 19:55.821
You think I'm selfish?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.156
I once saw you
unplug a café's Christmas lights

19:58.240 --> 20:00.826
-so you could charge your phone.
-Oh, come on! For a quick bump.

20:00.909 --> 20:01.952
There were four people--

20:02.035 --> 20:05.163
Freddy, you're being a dick. Okay?

20:05.247 --> 20:08.041
I thought you were a dick
when I first met you, but I thought,

20:08.125 --> 20:10.043
"No, it's all right.
Everyone's a dick in their 20s."

20:10.127 --> 20:11.628
But then when you were
still a dick in your 30s,

20:11.712 --> 20:14.840
I thought, "He's under a lot of pressure.
He's got a new baby."

20:14.923 --> 20:17.676
And let's face it, you know,
Erica's not warm as toast, is she?

20:17.759 --> 20:18.927
But you are still being a dick,

20:19.011 --> 20:22.139
and there comes a point where you're not
acting like a dick anymore,

20:22.222 --> 20:23.599
you're just a dick.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
I'm not the sort of dick
who walks away from someone

20:26.351 --> 20:28.395
because he's being a dick,
but you do need to be careful, Freddy,

20:28.478 --> 20:29.980
because there are not that many of us left

20:30.063 --> 20:32.274
and you've already thrown one of us away.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.358
Okay?

20:34.943 --> 20:37.029
-Nikki, can you call Erica, please?
-Yeah.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.489
You, follow me.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.004
-Are you two all right?
-Yeah, why?

20:54.505 --> 20:57.341
-You don't need to talk?
-About what?

20:57.883 --> 20:59.510
You just had an argument.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.594
When?

21:01.803 --> 21:03.555
-What? What?
-Look at this.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.267
That looks very sore.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.560
I know, right?

21:10.062 --> 21:11.939
-Hello.
-Hello, hello.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.857
One staghorn fern.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.944
Thanking you.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.322
-Okay, then.
-Hang on. Wait, please.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.406
-What?
-Please.

21:21.490 --> 21:22.991
The kids think
they can get us back together.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.494
No, not back together,
just able to talk, all right?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.871
I'm having enough trouble
getting my own family

21:27.955 --> 21:29.831
without keeping your one functioning too.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.918
Okay, so this is neutral ground.
It's halfway between where you both live.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.963
Well, no, technically the canal
would be exactly halfway between.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.340
I'm assuming no one
wants to go in there, all right?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.259
So in that case,
let's do this on dry land.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.052
-Do what exactly?
-Just sort it out!

21:42.135 --> 21:45.556
Please! Sort it out for Lauren and…

21:45.639 --> 21:46.640
-Thomas.
-Thomas!

21:49.059 --> 21:50.227
Okay, fine.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.815
We need to talk about childcare.
You have got to take more responsibility.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.234
-I've been babysitting.
-You have babysat twice,

21:57.317 --> 21:59.862
and anyway, it's not even called that
when they're yours.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.114
-Have you been watering this?
-My God.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.740
I've had this since uni.
I don't want it neglected.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.993
You've had her since uni too
and you've neglected her, so…

22:06.076 --> 22:07.369
That's a fair point, mate, yeah.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.329
It's weird, the love affair
you've got with that plant.

22:09.413 --> 22:10.998
It's not weird. It's special.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.252
It's been there through everything.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.175
All right. Fine.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.803
-Freddy! What are you playing at?
-What are you doing?

22:24.887 --> 22:26.388
-What are you doing?
-Freddy!

22:26.471 --> 22:29.808
-No, you are right. It is just a plant.
-You can't just chuck it away!

22:29.892 --> 22:31.435
-Why?
-Because it's part of our family.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.436
But you hate it!

22:32.519 --> 22:35.314
I can hate something
and I can still be sad when I lose it!

22:40.736 --> 22:42.362
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

22:42.446 --> 22:44.531
What are you doing, Erica? Shit!

22:45.616 --> 22:46.909
-Freddy!
-No!

22:49.244 --> 22:50.787
Okay, come back! Just come back!

22:50.871 --> 22:52.289
I can't. She needs me!

22:52.372 --> 22:54.583
-Don't die, Erica. I'm coming.
-Freddy, I've got it.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.920
-What are you doing?
-Backstroke is my best stroke!

22:58.003 --> 22:59.087
I can't see you.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.464
Help him!

23:01.215 --> 23:03.008
I'm gonna stay here and watch their stuff.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.635
Mate, I'm gonna stay up here
and watch your stuff.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.470
-Okay! Thank you!
-Jason!

23:06.553 --> 23:09.556
What? That's a very expensive jacket.
Very expensive jacket.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.726
Where are you? Where are you?
I'm coming. I'm coming. I've got you.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.064
Oh, my God! I swallowed a lot of water.

23:17.147 --> 23:18.357
Come on.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.193
Oh, my God, there's a boat! Guys!

23:21.276 --> 23:22.277
-There's a boat!
-Oh, my God!

23:22.361 --> 23:23.820
-There's a boat, guys!
-Oh, my God!

23:23.904 --> 23:27.282
Okay, all right! Okay, okay, okay!
Stand up! Stand up, both of you!

23:27.366 --> 23:28.867
Just stand up!

23:35.374 --> 23:36.708
-How do?
-Hiya!

23:39.378 --> 23:41.588
-Hello, mate.
-You all right? Hi!

23:50.764 --> 23:52.933
Okay. Yeah, that would be really helpful.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.060
Look at him. He's like a new man.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.896
-Yeah, thanks to you.
-I dunno.

23:57.980 --> 24:01.525
I just sort of always assumed
that I'd be good in a crisis.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.110
When I was young,
I used to wanna be a fireman.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.278
Yeah?

24:05.028 --> 24:07.698
-I think you'd make a good fireman.
-Do you think so?

24:07.781 --> 24:11.660
Waiting outside, watching all their stuff
while they're inside fighting fires.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.417
Yeah. Saturday would be great.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.794
Maybe a boy would be good.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.588
Yeah?

24:24.214 --> 24:25.799
I thought the world
turned us all into monsters.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.134
Yeah, it has.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.762
So maybe the world needs one raised by us.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.307
Yeah?

24:34.391 --> 24:35.559
Yeah.

24:37.728 --> 24:42.232
-James Newman-Ross. That is good.
-It is.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.321
Come on.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.161
"Excuse me, Doctor. My son, James,
has got blocked sinuses."

24:55.037 --> 24:56.455
"Hi, I'm James's mum.

24:56.538 --> 25:00.125
I think we might have met
at the school fair." Yeah, I like that.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.753
"James is bloody shoplifting again.
I just can't get through to him."

25:02.836 --> 25:05.005
Okay, well, don't ruin it.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.924
Still sounds good though.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.219
-Cheers. Bye.
-Thanks.

26:07.109 --> 26:08.735
Go, go, go.
