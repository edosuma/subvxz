WEBVTT

00:53.688 --> 00:55.922
And they lived happily...

00:55.924 --> 00:58.423
- Ever after!
- Ever after!

01:11.171 --> 01:13.773
Shema Israel?

01:13.775 --> 01:17.677
<i>Shema Israel, Hashem Eloheinu,
Hashem Echad.</i>

01:17.679 --> 01:19.879
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:19.881 --> 01:21.581
Love you.

01:21.583 --> 01:24.418
Love you, too. Goodnight.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.396
- Father...
- Mh-hm?

01:40.167 --> 01:42.102
Why do they hate us?

01:44.939 --> 01:48.841
I don't think they hate us.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.142
Hitler is just blaming us
for the suffering

01:51.144 --> 01:52.979
of the working class

01:52.981 --> 01:55.115
and some people
choose to believe him.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.119
But why?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.890
It's not a simple
answer...

02:04.626 --> 02:07.660
...but I can tell you this..

02:07.662 --> 02:09.494
The economy is getting better.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.798
And soon they will stop focusing
on who to blame

02:12.800 --> 02:16.167
for what didn't work,
and everyone will set their eyes

02:16.169 --> 02:18.537
on building a better future.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.539
We just have to keep
contributing our part

02:20.541 --> 02:25.443
to Germany,
like we have always done.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.379
Go to sleep now.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.782
You have school tomorrow,
and you are too young

02:29.784 --> 02:31.653
<i>to worry about
these things, hm.</i>

02:36.024 --> 02:38.693
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.644
<i>Ten-hut!</i>

05:12.213 --> 05:13.681
General Patton.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.362
Good evening, soldiers!

05:31.364 --> 05:33.000
Good evening, sir!

05:34.602 --> 05:36.336
At ease!

05:39.540 --> 05:42.975
If we take the generally
accepted definition of bravery

05:42.977 --> 05:46.979
as a quality which knows no fear

05:46.981 --> 05:50.683
I have never seen a brave man.

05:50.685 --> 05:54.485
All men are frightened.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.656
Courage is no more than fear

05:57.658 --> 06:01.260
holding on a minute longer.

06:01.262 --> 06:06.065
Now imagine fighting this war
as a civilian.

06:06.067 --> 06:08.801
Imagine not knowing
how to shoot a gun

06:08.803 --> 06:13.174
and challenging the Nazis
to save lives.

06:16.010 --> 06:20.145
I've just heard
an incredible story.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.548
I'd like to share it with you.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.450
<i>Because it's a story</i>

06:25.452 --> 06:28.854
about one of those unique
human beings

06:28.856 --> 06:31.924
that makes your sacrifices

06:31.926 --> 06:34.693
and your heroism

06:34.695 --> 06:36.831
completely worth it.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.959
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

07:39.360 --> 07:41.492
Oh, my God! Father!
What a surprise to see you!

07:41.494 --> 07:43.829
How dare you?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.297
Did you like my show?

07:45.299 --> 07:48.133
You are a clown dressed like
Hitler in a whorehouse..

07:48.135 --> 07:52.171
Papa, it's not Hitler, it's
Chaplin and it's a cabaret..

07:52.173 --> 07:54.308
Oh, I apologize
for my confusion.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.546
Father, I'm an actor.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.917
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:07.021 --> 08:11.392
We have to start early tomorrow.
Let's go home. Go.

08:21.135 --> 08:24.005
Mrs. Garber is coming.
Mrs. Garber is coming.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.541
- Hello, Mrs. Garber.
- Hello.

08:29.543 --> 08:33.445
- How is Emma?
- She's good, thank you.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.581
How come you always
ask about her?

08:35.583 --> 08:39.184
Actually, my father wants me
to marry her.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.322
- Really?
- Really.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.890
Is that true, Charles?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.092
Is she Jewish?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.528
- I think so.
- Then, no.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.865
Why?

08:52.466 --> 08:54.299
I wouldn't wish on
any Jewish girl

08:54.301 --> 08:57.436
the infinite disgrace of dealing
for life with this useless bum

08:57.438 --> 09:00.574
who wants to be a clown
and has the muscles of a ghost.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.512
Well, most of that is true.

09:05.514 --> 09:08.047
Emma is the only Jewish woman
in the world

09:08.049 --> 09:09.982
who doesn't want to marry.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.119
You shouldn't waste your time.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.123
Thank you.

09:23.597 --> 09:27.900
- I don't think that worked.
- No, I think it did.

09:27.902 --> 09:30.235
- She now thinks you are a bum.
- No, no.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.971
Psychological projection,
according to Dr. Freud.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.108
- Never heard of him.
- I know. Uh..

09:36.110 --> 09:38.877
Blaming others can lead to
a "kick the dog" effect

09:38.879 --> 09:40.212
where individuals in a hierarchy

09:40.214 --> 09:41.480
blame their immediate
subordinate

09:41.482 --> 09:43.182
and this propagates
down the chain

09:43.184 --> 09:45.319
until the lowest rung.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.786
What does that even mean?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.089
It means if the butcher thinks
you are a bum

09:50.091 --> 09:52.226
you are probably a genius.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.061
- Mh-hm!
- Yes.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.533
- Ah!
- Tell Dr. Freud to cure that!

10:02.369 --> 10:05.304
- Good evening, uncle.
- <i>Shalom,</i> Georges.

10:05.306 --> 10:08.541
Do you mind if I talk to Marcel
for a second?

10:08.543 --> 10:11.043
I've told you a million times,
I'm a serious actor, okay?

10:11.045 --> 10:12.579
I'm not a clown.

10:12.581 --> 10:15.214
I just need your help.
These kids went through a lot.

10:15.216 --> 10:17.116
What do I care
what they went through?

10:17.118 --> 10:18.585
- Don't say that.
- I'm saying it.

10:18.587 --> 10:20.219
I'm saying. I'm sorry,
I don't care, okay?

10:20.221 --> 10:21.487
I'm not good with children.

10:21.489 --> 10:23.222
You know, I have no patience.
Sorry.

10:23.224 --> 10:24.823
You know, I barely have time
to work with my father

10:24.825 --> 10:26.091
he now wants me there all day.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.493
I have an entire play
I'm working on

10:27.495 --> 10:29.094
where I interpret 30 different
characters.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.462
- Thirty!
- Marcel!

10:30.464 --> 10:33.098
- What?
- These are Jewish orphans.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.334
I know that. I know that.
You know, I.. sorry, I..

10:35.336 --> 10:37.302
I definitely have
an alive Jewish father.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.437
That hasn't made my life
any easier.

10:38.439 --> 10:40.575
That's a horrible thing to say.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.943
- How do you want me to help?
- Go work on your play.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.212
- Ah..
- You have many characters to write.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.047
- Georges!
- Go away.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.016
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:03.598 --> 11:06.331
Hi, Flore.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.520
I just saw your mother.

11:27.522 --> 11:31.356
She was telling my father
that I should marry you, hm.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.825
Strange. That generation,
I guess, they're old, you know.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.662
They don't understand that,
of course, we would only

11:35.664 --> 11:37.829
get married for love.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.366
And you couldn't find love
at the cabaret, could you?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.235
Hey, don't believe everything
you hear about that place.

11:43.237 --> 11:44.504
- Okay?
- I'm sure it's very reputable.

11:44.506 --> 11:45.804
Well, art can happen anywhere.

11:45.806 --> 11:49.241
Okay, look at, uh,
look at Marcel Duchamp.

11:49.243 --> 11:50.909
I don't know who that is.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.845
Yes, well, you should before you
judge an artist by his canvas.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.480
And your canvas is the cabaret?

11:55.482 --> 11:58.285
Yes. No. No, what?
Who are you again?

11:59.787 --> 12:02.221
- The girl you want to marry.
- Excuse me, no, no.

12:02.223 --> 12:03.455
I don't want to marry you.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.723
Your mother wants you
to marry me

12:04.725 --> 12:07.826
and I was just being polite
to her.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.596
There they are!

12:09.598 --> 12:13.801
- How many did you say?
- 123 children.

12:15.503 --> 12:19.204
<i>The foundation paid a fortune
for their lives.</i>

12:19.206 --> 12:22.343
<i>Their parents were just killed
by Nazis.</i>

12:31.785 --> 12:32.951
Marcel..

13:07.656 --> 13:09.591
You want to look?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.169
- Are you ready?
- I am.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.638
Why is my brother here?

13:25.640 --> 13:27.507
<i>I thought he may clown
for the kids.</i>

13:27.509 --> 13:29.509
He only cares about himself.

13:29.511 --> 13:32.647
And God forbid you call him
clown, he'll get all crazy.

13:34.148 --> 13:37.182
<i>Look, if he doesn't help,
we'll send him home</i>

13:37.184 --> 13:39.451
but at this point
we need everyone.

13:39.453 --> 13:43.188
Alright. That bus is not enough.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.892
<i>It's all we've got.</i>

13:46.393 --> 13:48.596
I can get our father's truck.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.232
That's a good idea.

13:53.601 --> 13:55.467
Make sure there's no knives
or meat in there.

13:55.469 --> 13:57.237
<i>The children are afraid.</i>

13:59.039 --> 14:00.238
Go.

14:12.587 --> 14:13.887
Alright.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.762
Come on. Let's go.

14:22.831 --> 14:24.766
What's wrong? Let's go.

14:33.675 --> 14:35.175
Hmm.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.115
Let's go.

14:54.228 --> 14:55.896
<i>Do you wanna come down?</i>

15:00.934 --> 15:04.871
This way. Careful.

15:04.873 --> 15:06.808
It's okay.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.435
Easy! Don't be this way.

15:37.906 --> 15:40.972
Oh, oh. Calm down.
Everybody, calm down. Calm down.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.009
Calm down. There is food
for everyone.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.645
There's no need to fight.

15:45.647 --> 15:48.480
Sit down at the table.
No, no need..

15:48.482 --> 15:50.415
- <i>I'll give you this..</i>
- <i>No pushing.</i>

15:50.417 --> 15:52.854
<i>Georges. Georges,
please help me.</i>

16:01.094 --> 16:03.030
Try this one.

16:05.399 --> 16:08.368
- Is it too big?
- No, it's fine.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.582
It's alright.

16:22.584 --> 16:25.283
You are becoming a big girl.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.520
Come with me.

16:27.522 --> 16:29.990
Mila, I'll be right back.

16:34.629 --> 16:36.764
Am I going to be okay?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.437
You are okay.

16:45.439 --> 16:48.641
This happens to every woman.

16:48.643 --> 16:51.142
It happens to me.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.080
It just means you are growing.

16:54.682 --> 16:59.785
So, from now on,
once a month for a few days

16:59.787 --> 17:03.221
you are going to have to wear
one of these.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.289
What's that?

17:04.291 --> 17:05.858
It's a special napkin

17:05.860 --> 17:09.629
that makes sure the blood
doesn't reach your clothes.

17:09.631 --> 17:12.598
It's only going to last
for a few days.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.536
It's like, um, a rehearsal
to prepare for the day

17:16.538 --> 17:21.039
<i>many years from now, when you
are ready to have a baby.</i>

17:21.041 --> 17:27.145
No. No running. No, no.
There is no need to run.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.180
You're gonna hurt yourself.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.428
Calm down everyone.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.998
Please, no standing
on the table.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.167
Be nice to each other.
You're family now.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.773
This is your new home.

19:04.378 --> 19:06.514
What's he doing?

20:55.990 --> 20:59.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Blow!

21:56.316 --> 21:57.752
Blow.

22:07.094 --> 22:08.229
Go.

23:30.044 --> 23:34.181
You dress like a clown,
you paint a clown.

23:39.921 --> 23:42.056
What can I do for you?

23:48.162 --> 23:52.465
You rub the brush on paint,
you draw a face.

23:54.302 --> 23:58.804
I'm not going to say it's ugly,
I think you are getting better.

23:58.806 --> 24:01.607
<i>I just never quiet understood
why does anyone do it</i>

24:01.609 --> 24:03.542
even when it's great.

24:03.544 --> 24:05.478
Tell me. Why do you do it?

24:08.616 --> 24:10.481
Why do you go to the bathroom?

24:10.483 --> 24:12.418
Oh, you need not
to offend your father.

24:12.420 --> 24:14.485
No, no.
No, I'm not offending you.

24:14.487 --> 24:18.359
I'm, I'm asking.
Why do you go to the bathroom?

24:19.994 --> 24:23.130
Because my body
gives me no choice.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.933
There it is.

24:27.935 --> 24:30.071
That's my answer
to your question.

25:13.781 --> 25:15.381
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.517
Amen.

25:20.121 --> 25:23.822
Ah, steak. How original.
Wh... where did you get this?

25:23.824 --> 25:26.492
Thanks.
Where did you get that suit?

25:26.494 --> 25:30.129
Actually, it's not a suit.
This is a feminine undergarment.

25:30.131 --> 25:32.631
- I took it from mother.
- Charles..

25:32.633 --> 25:35.167
Alain thinks Hitler is going to
invade Poland

25:35.169 --> 25:37.369
and the war is gonna spill
all over France.

25:37.371 --> 25:40.472
Hitler has zero chance
against France. He's bluffing.

25:40.474 --> 25:44.109
I almost wish he makes
that blunder so we destroy him.

25:44.111 --> 25:45.944
- Have you heard him talk?
- Ah!

25:45.946 --> 25:47.514
Talk, talk, talk, talk.

25:47.516 --> 25:50.616
Populist talk so that idiots
can rage with euphoria

25:50.618 --> 25:53.018
and feel better about their
miserable lives.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.787
I think Alain has a point

25:54.789 --> 25:57.890
and we should be ready
in case we have to leave.

25:57.892 --> 26:00.692
I left Poland to escape
anti-Semitism

26:00.694 --> 26:03.762
and now you're telling me
to prepare to leave again?

26:03.764 --> 26:05.030
No. No.

26:05.032 --> 26:07.666
Yeah, me too.
I... I can't just leave.

26:07.668 --> 26:09.968
Because of the children? Wow.

26:09.970 --> 26:12.604
The children? I'm helping
the children as much as I can

26:12.606 --> 26:14.206
but I'm working on my play,
okay?

26:14.208 --> 26:15.641
I'm upstairs painting
the backdrops myself.

26:15.643 --> 26:17.476
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, I'm stupid.

26:17.478 --> 26:19.078
For a second I thought you had
started caring

26:19.080 --> 26:21.113
about someone
other than yourself.

26:21.115 --> 26:24.116
So.. Why would the children
be my responsibility?

26:24.118 --> 26:25.784
Maybe because
they are the only ones

26:25.786 --> 26:28.153
who don't consider your <i>art</i>

26:28.155 --> 26:29.990
completely ridiculous.

26:38.065 --> 26:42.768
There are 123 children
in that castle.

26:42.770 --> 26:46.105
Please, tell me, where... where
are we supposed to take them?

26:46.107 --> 26:47.975
Do whatever you want.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.911
You keep calling Marcel selfish.

26:52.913 --> 26:54.213
Yeah.

26:54.215 --> 26:55.647
But last I heard he's there

26:55.649 --> 26:56.949
helping children every day

26:56.951 --> 26:59.253
while you are theorizing
about Hitler.

27:06.193 --> 27:08.528
How long has it been?

27:08.530 --> 27:10.664
About a year
since they got here.

27:16.003 --> 27:18.837
Hello, Alain.

27:18.839 --> 27:20.975
Come on. Let's go.

27:23.444 --> 27:27.614
- Marcel!
- Oh, no. Incoming. Incoming.

27:27.616 --> 27:29.348
Ah!

27:29.350 --> 27:31.817
Oh, oh, please, help me.
Please, help me.

27:31.819 --> 27:35.287
Oh, okay. Whoa! W... whoa!

27:35.289 --> 27:37.956
Okay, thank you very much.
I hope you're happy now.

27:37.958 --> 27:39.258
- Marcel?
- Yes?

27:39.260 --> 27:41.827
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes. Quickly.

27:41.829 --> 27:44.096
Emma likes you.

27:44.098 --> 27:46.298
Okay. Yes. Oh, hello.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.400
- So, you like her, too?
- Oh, oh, yes.

27:48.402 --> 27:51.069
I... it's a great book. We are
talking about something else.

27:51.071 --> 27:53.438
Entirely different.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.176
I like every princess
in this castle. Okay?

27:57.178 --> 27:58.810
Maybe next time you want say it
a little louder.

27:58.812 --> 28:00.580
- I will.
- Broadcast it over the radio please.

28:00.582 --> 28:02.281
- <i>Bye, Marcel!</i>
- Goodbye.

28:02.283 --> 28:05.417
- Ah, Georges. Hello, Flore.
- Hello, Marcel.

28:05.419 --> 28:07.021
Alain!

28:09.757 --> 28:12.457
Hey! Georges!

28:12.459 --> 28:15.664
- Good to see you!
- Hello, Alain. Good to see you!

28:17.865 --> 28:20.265
<i>Tell me, what do you know?</i>

28:20.267 --> 28:22.569
No more than
what's on the radio.

28:22.571 --> 28:25.003
But we must prepare everyone
to move south.

28:25.005 --> 28:26.872
The children
are finally settled.

28:26.874 --> 28:30.342
It would be irresponsible not to
start looking for alternatives.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.477
What alternatives?
You've got another castle?

28:32.479 --> 28:35.414
Uh, no, no. Alain believes
having them all in one place

28:35.416 --> 28:37.849
is dangerous in itself. Right?

28:37.851 --> 28:39.787
I'm not sure I follow.

28:42.923 --> 28:46.858
Hitler's rise is empowering
the worst possible groups.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.428
Everybody knows Jewish children
are living here.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.330
You don't want this place
to become a target.

28:51.332 --> 28:53.666
I'm not going to bring them
more instability

28:53.668 --> 28:57.402
just because you suddenly feel
it may get dangerous.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.606
You are a mile away
from Nazi Germany

28:59.608 --> 29:01.406
where an extremely popular
leader is preparing

29:01.408 --> 29:04.142
<i>the most powerful army
in the history of Europe</i>

29:04.144 --> 29:06.646
to conquer a neighboring country

29:06.648 --> 29:09.783
while he blames
all possible evil on the Jews.

29:12.453 --> 29:15.420
Can I have one apple?

29:15.422 --> 29:16.725
Sure.

29:22.062 --> 29:24.198
- Be gentle.
- Yeah.

29:28.603 --> 29:32.371
I think all he is saying is
we should prepare for the worst.

29:32.373 --> 29:35.510
And he's right.
There is no other option.

29:37.646 --> 29:40.812
I also think I should get
started with their training.

29:40.814 --> 29:43.081
Training for what?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.484
They are children.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.622
We need to train them
to survive.

29:56.564 --> 29:58.700
- Nazis! Nazis!
- Nazis! Nazis!

30:00.702 --> 30:02.637
Hurry, Joseph!

30:30.699 --> 30:33.332
Juden?

30:33.334 --> 30:35.804
Juden? You maybe?

30:38.372 --> 30:40.606
Juden on the trees.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.349
- Don't do that!
- <i>Come down, Joseph!</i>

30:49.751 --> 30:52.117
- Ah!
- Yes.

30:52.119 --> 30:54.353
Listen.

30:54.355 --> 30:57.189
Your life and that of
all your friends

30:57.191 --> 30:59.324
will depend on your silence.

30:59.326 --> 31:00.760
We're not playing here.

31:00.762 --> 31:03.696
But Marcel is still funny,
Nazis are not.

31:07.569 --> 31:09.234
You see?

31:09.236 --> 31:11.838
Okay, everyone, come down.

31:11.840 --> 31:15.808
Now, have you seen
a squirrel hide?

31:15.810 --> 31:17.746
A squirrel?

31:26.186 --> 31:31.890
The squirrel does not find
a place to hide in the tree.

31:31.892 --> 31:34.993
No, the squirrel
finds a place to hide

31:34.995 --> 31:39.499
where she can become
a part of the tree.

31:39.501 --> 31:43.569
Now, the trick
i... is not to make sure

31:43.571 --> 31:46.304
that they don't see you

31:46.306 --> 31:49.908
but that even if they do see you

31:49.910 --> 31:53.247
what they see does not catch
their attention.

31:55.015 --> 31:57.550
Make the invisible visible

31:57.552 --> 32:00.722
and the visible, invisible.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.193
Marcel?

32:08.195 --> 32:09.862
- Can't see him.
- Where is he?

32:09.864 --> 32:11.329
Where's he gone?

32:11.331 --> 32:12.667
Marcel?

32:14.401 --> 32:17.837
- Marcel?
- Where'd he go?

32:22.176 --> 32:24.577
Get in. Get in. Come on.

32:24.579 --> 32:27.179
Yes, come in. It's cold,
it's freezing.

32:29.183 --> 32:30.685
Come in.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.301
<i>As a result of the German
invasion of Poland..</i>

32:49.303 --> 32:53.038
<i>...the French Government
has ordered all citizens</i>

32:53.040 --> 32:58.410
<i>to evacuate all border towns
in the next ten days.</i>

32:58.412 --> 33:00.715
We need to tell the kids
we are leaving.

33:02.584 --> 33:06.017
I'll be sending telegrams
to the Jewish communities

33:06.019 --> 33:08.921
to ask families to receive.

33:08.923 --> 33:12.625
Families can take some,
but there's too many.

33:12.627 --> 33:15.193
What do you suggest?

33:15.195 --> 33:18.432
We're gonna need the church
to receive some of the children.

33:20.969 --> 33:23.034
The religious kids are
always talking about how mad

33:23.036 --> 33:25.605
their parents will be if they
find out they broke kosher laws

33:25.607 --> 33:28.206
and you want to send them
to a church?

33:28.208 --> 33:31.746
The Jewish law can be broken
in life threatening situations.

33:33.948 --> 33:37.315
Maybe it's time
to be honest with them.

34:03.210 --> 34:09.551
I don't know how we're supposed
to tell them that this is over.

34:14.288 --> 34:17.424
Are you not going to say
anything?

35:24.025 --> 35:25.125
Thank you.

35:27.962 --> 35:31.797
<i>Next week is Rosh Hashana.</i>

35:31.799 --> 35:33.431
<i>A very special one..</i>

35:33.433 --> 35:35.133
Alright. I know. It's okay.

35:35.135 --> 35:39.170
<i>...because we welcome
not only a new year..</i>

35:39.172 --> 35:41.439
There we go.

35:41.441 --> 35:43.745
...but a new century.

35:49.483 --> 35:54.956
We are going to receive
the year 5700.

35:58.258 --> 36:02.895
In every generation
they rise up against us.

36:02.897 --> 36:07.165
Sometimes, a powerful man

36:07.167 --> 36:10.069
<i>sometimes, an army</i>

36:10.071 --> 36:14.573
<i>or a nation tries to destroy
the Jewish people.</i>

36:14.575 --> 36:17.910
<i>But here we are, together</i>

36:17.912 --> 36:23.716
knowing that this time too,
the Holy One, blessed be He

36:23.718 --> 36:26.854
will rescue us from their hands.

36:28.255 --> 36:31.991
<i>We're going to continue
taking care of you.</i>

36:31.993 --> 36:37.362
But for a while, we won't be
staying all together.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.799
<i>And because of that</i>

36:39.801 --> 36:45.303
we decided to blow
the shofar now

36:45.305 --> 36:48.507
<i>one week before Rosh Hashana</i>

36:48.509 --> 36:51.644
<i>so that you have this moment</i>

36:51.646 --> 36:55.447
and that sound to remind you

36:55.449 --> 36:59.151
that you are not alone.

37:08.863 --> 37:11.797
Alright, everyone.
Let's go to the South!

38:26.073 --> 38:29.575
We already placed forty
with Jewish families

38:29.577 --> 38:33.746
twelve with Gentiles,
sixteen in catholic schools

38:33.748 --> 38:36.381
and thirty in the orphanage
of Izieu..

38:36.383 --> 38:38.584
That's a hundred out,
twenty more to go.

38:38.586 --> 38:43.255
I wish, but we're expecting
dozens of new orphans

38:43.257 --> 38:45.193
to arrive from Germany.

38:57.205 --> 38:59.872
- You ready?
- Yes, I am.

38:59.874 --> 39:01.774
- What are you doing?
- Hi.

39:32.974 --> 39:35.674
There's a group in Lyon
arming themselves to fight back.

39:35.676 --> 39:37.343
I know some of those guys.

39:37.345 --> 39:40.112
De Gaulle is helping them from
Britain with money and weapons.

39:40.114 --> 39:42.514
It's a well-organized force.
If you want to join them..

39:42.516 --> 39:46.252
Oh, no, I, I don't fight, okay?
I think, therefore I am.

39:46.254 --> 39:49.255
We've been thinking
for 5000 years.

39:49.257 --> 39:53.125
Maybe it's time
to try something else.

39:53.127 --> 39:55.460
Do you really think I could
help anyone with a gun?

39:55.462 --> 39:57.397
Of course not.

40:00.501 --> 40:02.467
Okay.

40:02.469 --> 40:04.803
Look at this, Emma.

40:04.805 --> 40:06.941
Marcel Marceau.

40:13.681 --> 40:16.817
- It's perfect.
- Let me see.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.390
It's a great name.

41:59.086 --> 42:01.555
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

43:08.923 --> 43:11.058
You're gonna visit me, right?

43:19.166 --> 43:22.236
You know, if you don't visit me,
I'll forget about you.

43:28.577 --> 43:29.677
Thank you.

43:32.079 --> 43:34.215
Come, come, come, come.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.385
Let's go.

43:41.021 --> 43:42.356
Goodnight.

43:52.501 --> 43:53.634
What?

43:56.370 --> 43:58.672
- Why are we kissing? Okay.
- Shut up!

44:05.045 --> 44:07.181
Passports, please.

44:08.583 --> 44:10.519
Yes, yes. Of course.

44:19.326 --> 44:23.195
Please don't tell my father
about this. He knows nothing.

44:23.197 --> 44:25.332
Who's your father?

44:26.800 --> 44:29.434
What are you laughing at?

44:29.436 --> 44:31.470
Please don't tell him.
My father will kill me.

44:31.472 --> 44:32.971
No, the officer won't say a word

44:32.973 --> 44:34.740
or he will be killed
by your father.

44:34.742 --> 44:36.909
I'm sorry. Please don't.

44:36.911 --> 44:38.445
Okay.

44:44.251 --> 44:48.655
Miss Garneau, I'm not interested
in your father.

44:48.657 --> 44:52.057
Whatever your naughty business
is with this man

44:52.059 --> 44:54.328
who is clearly
not of your class..

44:56.430 --> 44:58.430
But I want this to be
the last time I find you

44:58.432 --> 45:00.567
in the mist of
indecent activity

45:00.569 --> 45:03.202
or I will have to bring you
to your father myself.

45:03.204 --> 45:05.339
Thank you, officer.

45:11.345 --> 45:12.446
Go home.

46:05.199 --> 46:07.067
Elise Leroy.

46:15.543 --> 46:16.975
- Everything okay?
- Yes, yes.

46:16.977 --> 46:19.044
The priest seems like
a good person, right?

46:19.046 --> 46:20.649
Elsbeth is strong.

46:23.017 --> 46:24.785
Yes, yes.

46:30.090 --> 46:32.560
- Okay. Listen.
- Yeah.

46:34.128 --> 46:37.429
The, uh, the Resistance group
in Lyon.

46:37.431 --> 46:40.733
- What?
- How could we join them?

46:40.735 --> 46:42.200
Who?

46:42.202 --> 46:43.969
What do you mean who?
Me. Us.

46:43.971 --> 46:46.106
- You?
- Yes. Me.

46:47.107 --> 46:48.409
What happened?

46:49.877 --> 46:53.045
We just got stopped by these
Vichy officers

46:53.047 --> 46:56.848
you know, and... I, I just..

46:56.850 --> 46:59.484
I don't want to keep,
like, running, you know

46:59.486 --> 47:01.556
without doing something
about it.

47:04.358 --> 47:08.393
Listen... these Lyon fighters,
they're serious

47:08.395 --> 47:11.396
tough folks,
risking their lives for France.

47:11.398 --> 47:13.633
They get approached by
infiltrators on a regular basis

47:13.635 --> 47:15.568
and if I make contact,
there's no turning back.

47:15.570 --> 47:17.869
- I know.
- If you're just mad because you got stopped.

47:17.871 --> 47:19.438
No, I'm not just mad.

47:19.440 --> 47:23.277
No, I'm... I'm ready to fight.

47:26.347 --> 47:27.680
Georges is expecting more
children.

47:27.682 --> 47:29.682
Yeah, well, Georges
will take care of them.

47:29.684 --> 47:32.652
He is a saint.
I will talk to him.

47:32.654 --> 47:34.789
I thought you'd be,
you know, proud of me.

47:37.391 --> 47:40.492
- I'm proud of you.
- Okay. Maybe you could say..

47:40.494 --> 47:41.960
- I'm proud of you.
- Okay. Thank you.

47:41.962 --> 47:44.162
But first you must
talk to our father.

47:44.164 --> 47:45.964
To tell him it's your decision.

47:45.966 --> 47:48.166
Okay, I will go tell him.

47:48.168 --> 47:50.235
You know where he is?

47:50.237 --> 47:52.306
- In the apartment.
- No.

49:13.287 --> 49:14.789
Marcel?

49:17.525 --> 49:20.994
What in the world
did I just see?

49:24.965 --> 49:26.601
You were in there?

49:27.869 --> 49:30.505
I saw you from upstairs.

49:34.475 --> 49:35.976
Did you like it?

49:37.879 --> 49:39.446
You can sing.

49:43.283 --> 49:46.686
That's what
I always wanted to do

49:46.688 --> 49:49.891
but my father was a butcher,
his father was a butcher.

49:52.493 --> 49:55.160
I couldn't just become a singer.

49:55.162 --> 49:56.896
And now you can.

49:56.898 --> 49:58.031
Yes.

49:59.399 --> 50:01.301
Because now I have nothing.

50:02.604 --> 50:05.339
They took everything
but my voice.

50:07.542 --> 50:10.979
So, so wh... why did you
fight my passion?

50:18.653 --> 50:20.855
Because I didn't want you
to starve.

50:22.189 --> 50:25.560
Because most artists cannot make
a living, you know?

50:28.061 --> 50:30.732
At least a butcher
will never be hungry.

50:42.944 --> 50:45.745
That was,
that was a great performance.

50:45.747 --> 50:48.446
- So, you liked it?
- I did like it. I... I..

50:48.448 --> 50:50.983
- Yes?
- I would relax on stage more.

50:50.985 --> 50:54.119
- That's it. I'd just..
- Ah, so, you didn't like it?

50:54.121 --> 50:55.655
Excuse.. Uh, I did like it.

50:55.657 --> 50:57.088
I'm saying,
I think you could enjoy it more

50:57.090 --> 50:58.456
and then, you know,
we would feel it.

50:58.458 --> 50:59.692
Okay, I tell you something.

50:59.694 --> 51:03.094
Maybe, when the,
when the war is over..

51:03.096 --> 51:04.664
Mm.

51:04.666 --> 51:06.433
...we, we could..

51:07.835 --> 51:09.837
...we can perform together.

51:12.472 --> 51:16.410
Alain and I are joining
the Resistance.

51:22.850 --> 51:24.684
May Hashem protect you both.

52:56.110 --> 52:58.079
No, no, no.
Don't stop. Don't stop.

55:32.266 --> 55:33.666
Let's go! Let's go!

55:49.884 --> 55:52.117
There is Marcel. Marcel!

55:52.119 --> 55:54.021
There is Emma!
There is Emma!

55:55.756 --> 55:57.859
Get in. Get in. Get in.

56:00.460 --> 56:01.963
Go, go, go, go.

56:06.334 --> 56:07.735
Oh, my God.

56:28.689 --> 56:30.691
Welcome to the Resistance.

57:29.482 --> 57:30.851
Sit down.

57:37.258 --> 57:38.759
Who is Marcel?

57:39.727 --> 57:40.826
Me.

57:40.828 --> 57:42.761
Your passports are impressive.

57:42.763 --> 57:46.165
Thank you, sir..
Madam.

57:46.167 --> 57:48.734
Sir is fine, if it helps you.

57:48.736 --> 57:51.236
We're about to receive 20
fighters from Britain.

57:51.238 --> 57:54.073
- How long would they take you?
- Twenty?

57:54.075 --> 57:57.076
Well, you may think it's some kind
of, like, a mechanical process, okay?

57:57.078 --> 57:59.945
But it actually takes real art to
study the curves and the movement of

57:59.947 --> 58:01.380
excuse me,
of each letter.

58:01.382 --> 58:03.382
The strength with which it was
written

58:03.384 --> 58:05.217
because it wasn't the same
person who did each passport.

58:05.219 --> 58:07.319
And the combination of colors
that gives you a black

58:07.321 --> 58:08.954
that looks authentic,
because believe it or not

58:08.956 --> 58:10.189
black has different tones, okay?

58:10.191 --> 58:11.423
And it varies
from city to city...

58:11.425 --> 58:12.858
How long?

58:12.860 --> 58:14.929
Twenty would take me a day.

58:16.130 --> 58:18.397
They're landing in an hour.

58:18.399 --> 58:20.165
An hour?

58:20.167 --> 58:22.001
We've been here for an hour.
You could have told me.

58:22.003 --> 58:24.003
Most of Europe is crying
in surrender

58:24.005 --> 58:25.971
while the city of Lyon
has the only Resistance

58:25.973 --> 58:28.009
<i>that is truly hurting
the Nazis.</i>

58:29.176 --> 58:31.577
You can sit there
or you can tell me

58:31.579 --> 58:33.981
<i>what you need to get them done
in an hour.</i>

58:38.552 --> 58:40.085
Give us 20 French passports.

58:40.087 --> 58:42.957
Let Marcel choose the names.
He'll get it done.

58:44.892 --> 58:48.362
We're leaving in 20 minutes.
Only Marcel comes with us.

1:00:32.266 --> 1:00:34.536
I've never met a Jewish painter.

1:00:38.873 --> 1:00:41.206
You don't have to
pretend with me.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:44.443
Thank you, but there are plenty
of Jewish painters.

1:00:44.445 --> 1:00:46.745
But it's not your people's forte

1:00:46.747 --> 1:00:51.917
when you compare it to writers,
scientists, and you know why?

1:00:51.919 --> 1:00:55.089
Because your religion doesn't
let you draw God.

1:00:56.625 --> 1:01:00.092
Which is also why
so many people hate you.

1:01:00.094 --> 1:01:03.061
They get afraid when they can't
see who you are praying to.

1:01:03.063 --> 1:01:07.468
No, they hate us because for centuries
they've been told that we killed Christ.

1:01:15.476 --> 1:01:17.644
The entire epic
of the Jewish people

1:01:17.646 --> 1:01:22.147
is that those who were slaves
in Egypt liberated themselves

1:01:22.149 --> 1:01:25.184
to create their own society.

1:01:25.186 --> 1:01:29.254
No symbol is more dangerous
for oppressors than Jews

1:01:29.256 --> 1:01:32.424
because Jews
are emancipated slaves.

1:01:32.426 --> 1:01:33.292
Huh.

1:02:23.844 --> 1:02:25.312
I thought you were asleep.

1:02:28.282 --> 1:02:30.384
Well, you certainly weren't.

1:02:32.052 --> 1:02:33.720
What do you mean?

1:02:35.889 --> 1:02:37.189
What?

1:02:37.191 --> 1:02:40.125
I didn't even know
you liked him.

1:02:40.127 --> 1:02:42.296
I don't tell you everything.

1:02:52.607 --> 1:02:53.839
Where is he now?

1:02:53.841 --> 1:02:55.442
He went to buy cigarettes.

1:02:56.910 --> 1:03:00.114
So, did you..

1:03:04.519 --> 1:03:05.786
Tell me!

1:03:13.127 --> 1:03:14.696
I love him.

1:03:25.205 --> 1:03:26.708
So, you did it.

1:03:46.728 --> 1:03:49.496
What? Tell me!

1:04:04.912 --> 1:04:07.946
<i>Nazis! Nazis!</i>

1:04:07.948 --> 1:04:10.484
Nazis! Nazis!

1:04:13.788 --> 1:04:15.289
They're here.

1:04:28.068 --> 1:04:29.537
What is that?

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:34.709
- Get the bags!
- Okay.

1:05:01.935 --> 1:05:03.402
- Name.
- Jason Baker.

1:05:03.404 --> 1:05:04.936
Let's go.

1:05:04.938 --> 1:05:06.574
Welcome to the Resistance.

1:05:50.184 --> 1:05:51.619
Stop.

1:05:53.721 --> 1:05:55.086
- Don't move!
- Hands in the air!

1:05:55.088 --> 1:05:56.421
Put your hands in the air!

1:05:56.423 --> 1:05:57.690
<i>No, no, no, no.
No, no, don't shoot!</i>

1:05:57.692 --> 1:05:59.090
<i>It's my brother.
Don't shoot!</i>

1:05:59.092 --> 1:06:01.861
It's my brother.
Alain. Alain?

1:06:01.863 --> 1:06:03.061
What happened?

1:06:03.063 --> 1:06:05.330
The Gestapo.

1:06:05.332 --> 1:06:06.868
They took everyone.

1:08:09.356 --> 1:08:12.525
Emma and Mila.

1:08:12.527 --> 1:08:13.960
Two Jewish sisters caught

1:08:13.962 --> 1:08:16.096
fighting with
the French Resistance.

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:23.571
This can end right now if you
tell me where are the men.

1:08:28.208 --> 1:08:29.544
Mm.

1:08:31.045 --> 1:08:33.581
Mila, you stay here.

1:08:36.884 --> 1:08:40.352
Mila. Shh, shh.

1:08:40.354 --> 1:08:43.423
Right there. Don't move!

1:08:45.425 --> 1:08:48.128
Where are you taking her?

1:09:34.008 --> 1:09:36.811
Are you familiar
with the word flaying?

1:09:38.746 --> 1:09:41.582
<i>Also known colloquially
as skinning.</i>

1:09:45.252 --> 1:09:46.219
No?

1:09:47.855 --> 1:09:51.423
<i>It is a method of a slow
and painful execution</i>

1:09:51.425 --> 1:09:53.859
<i>in which the skin
is removed from the body</i>

1:09:53.861 --> 1:09:56.030
while the person
is still alive.

1:09:58.198 --> 1:10:02.668
An attempt is made to keep the
removed portion of skin intact

1:10:02.670 --> 1:10:04.770
<i>and to keep
the person conscious</i>

1:10:04.772 --> 1:10:08.206
<i>for the majority
of the procedure.</i>

1:10:08.208 --> 1:10:12.011
You are going to kill me anyway.
What difference does it make?

1:10:12.013 --> 1:10:13.815
No, Emma.

1:10:17.085 --> 1:10:19.787
I've decided
I'm not going to kill you.

1:10:24.826 --> 1:10:29.063
I'm going to do that to your
sister... in front of you.

1:10:37.105 --> 1:10:38.271
Why?

1:10:41.109 --> 1:10:44.810
Because you don't want to
tell me where the men are.

1:10:44.812 --> 1:10:47.012
If I can't capture them

1:10:47.014 --> 1:10:49.048
I at least want you
to go back to them

1:10:49.050 --> 1:10:51.217
and tell them
what you've endured.

1:10:51.219 --> 1:10:54.754
To see if they want to continue
with their pointless Resistance.

1:10:54.756 --> 1:10:56.055
I don't know where they are.

1:10:56.057 --> 1:10:58.423
- <i>I don't know!</i>
- Ugh.

1:10:58.425 --> 1:11:00.492
I swear.

1:11:00.494 --> 1:11:02.563
I don't believe that.

1:11:09.604 --> 1:11:11.072
Emma?

1:11:13.007 --> 1:11:15.007
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:17.375
I didn't,
I didn't even touch her.

1:11:17.377 --> 1:11:19.580
He wants to know where they are.

1:11:21.048 --> 1:11:22.915
Don't tell him.

1:11:22.917 --> 1:11:24.583
He will kill us all the same!

1:11:24.585 --> 1:11:25.851
So, you do know!

1:11:25.853 --> 1:11:27.520
- I don't.
- <i>You do know!</i>

1:11:27.522 --> 1:11:29.054
- I don't!
- You do know!

1:11:29.056 --> 1:11:31.157
- I don't. I don't!
- <i>Kill me. I don't care.</i>

1:11:31.159 --> 1:11:35.393
We won't be traitors.
We won't be collaborators.

1:11:35.395 --> 1:11:37.295
<i>I respect that, you see..</i>

1:11:37.297 --> 1:11:38.731
We won't be collaborators.

1:11:38.733 --> 1:11:41.432
All these other people,
no dignity.

1:11:41.434 --> 1:11:45.871
I would rather die like you
than live like them.

1:11:45.873 --> 1:11:48.276
<i>Don't say anything, please.</i>

1:11:51.444 --> 1:11:54.046
Don't say anything.

1:11:54.048 --> 1:11:57.315
<i>Don't say anything,
Emma, please.</i>

1:11:57.317 --> 1:12:01.120
<i>I don't care what he does.
I don't.</i>

1:12:01.122 --> 1:12:03.388
- <i>Please do not do that.</i>
- <i>Please, Emma.</i>

1:12:03.390 --> 1:12:05.191
- No, don't. Please
- <i>Emma, no. No, Emma, Emma.</i>

1:12:05.193 --> 1:12:07.693
- No. Please. Don't!
- Please, Emma. Emma, please!

1:12:07.695 --> 1:12:10.529
- No!
- Don't do that! Don't do that!

1:12:10.531 --> 1:12:12.332
No, don't!

1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:21.909
We have to go in.

1:12:23.578 --> 1:12:25.412
- We have to go in.
- No, no.

1:12:41.829 --> 1:12:44.397
- Klaus Barbie.
- Yeah. I see him.

1:13:27.074 --> 1:13:30.743
What you looking at?
It's fine, it's fine. It's fine.

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:39.585
- It's her.
- Of course, it's her.

1:13:39.587 --> 1:13:41.153
Where's Mila?

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:45.092
Nobody should bother you
as long as you're wearing this.

1:14:20.962 --> 1:14:22.363
Where is she?

1:14:24.999 --> 1:14:26.732
<i>She's going in
the train station.</i>

1:14:26.734 --> 1:14:28.000
Where the hell is Mila?

1:14:28.002 --> 1:14:29.969
I don't know.
Emma will tell us.

1:14:29.971 --> 1:14:32.004
They'll catch us
as soon as we approach her.

1:14:32.006 --> 1:14:33.471
Okay. Okay, listen to me.

1:14:33.473 --> 1:14:35.507
Okay, bring the guards
towards you and run.

1:14:35.509 --> 1:14:37.843
- I'm going in.
- It's too dangerous.

1:14:37.845 --> 1:14:39.479
So, let them kill me.

1:14:41.849 --> 1:14:44.085
Go. Be safe.

1:16:22.883 --> 1:16:24.218
What are you doing?

1:16:28.656 --> 1:16:31.156
<i>We must train and grow
with the Resistance.</i>

1:16:31.158 --> 1:16:33.325
We need to find guns.
We need to learn how to shoot.

1:16:33.327 --> 1:16:35.129
We need to learn explosives.

1:16:36.664 --> 1:16:38.597
They're not humans.

1:16:38.599 --> 1:16:41.001
No human would do that
to another.

1:16:47.842 --> 1:16:49.410
While you were there..

1:16:51.045 --> 1:16:53.412
...I... I filled myself
with hate

1:16:53.414 --> 1:16:56.882
and of course I did feel
an urge for revenge

1:16:56.884 --> 1:17:01.286
but... the more I thought
about it

1:17:01.288 --> 1:17:04.559
the only thing in my mind..

1:17:07.862 --> 1:17:10.698
...was why are we here..

1:17:12.266 --> 1:17:15.568
...fighting a war we can't win..

1:17:15.570 --> 1:17:17.769
...when we could be taking
orphan children

1:17:17.771 --> 1:17:22.009
to another country
before the Nazis get to them?

1:17:32.086 --> 1:17:34.419
We can't leave now.

1:17:34.421 --> 1:17:36.556
But what... what can we
truly accomplish?

1:17:36.558 --> 1:17:38.692
We can fight back.

1:17:42.296 --> 1:17:45.264
We found homes for the children.
Safe places.

1:17:45.266 --> 1:17:46.732
No place is safe for them

1:17:46.734 --> 1:17:50.102
as long as they're in a country
that's occupied by Nazis

1:17:50.104 --> 1:17:51.803
and the little fighting
that we can do...

1:17:51.805 --> 1:17:53.238
We can slow them down.

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:55.676
We can make it impossible
for them in France.

1:18:04.318 --> 1:18:06.187
What is it the Nazis want?

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.124
What?

1:18:12.126 --> 1:18:14.059
They don't care about
Klaus Barbie

1:18:14.061 --> 1:18:16.094
you know,
or a bunch of Gestapo slaves

1:18:16.096 --> 1:18:18.230
that we may kill,
if we are lucky...

1:18:18.232 --> 1:18:19.534
No, you are right.

1:18:20.868 --> 1:18:23.470
They care about killing us
like they killed her.

1:18:28.409 --> 1:18:30.344
So, what's the best way
to resist?

1:18:32.179 --> 1:18:34.780
It's not to kill them.

1:18:34.782 --> 1:18:37.349
They're ready to die!

1:18:37.351 --> 1:18:38.651
If you want to resist

1:18:38.653 --> 1:18:42.389
we have to make sure
more Jews survive.

1:18:45.660 --> 1:18:48.128
How can you not want to go
and murder him?

1:18:49.196 --> 1:18:50.929
Of course,
I want to murder Barbie.

1:18:50.931 --> 1:18:55.467
I want Hitler to die as well,
but we can't kill all the Nazis.

1:18:55.469 --> 1:18:57.805
- We can kill some.
- Mm-hmm.

1:19:00.908 --> 1:19:02.776
Or you can save some lives.

1:19:04.679 --> 1:19:09.848
And maybe one day those Nazis
will be captured..

1:19:09.850 --> 1:19:14.388
...while the kids we saved
go on and... and form families.

1:19:21.128 --> 1:19:23.397
What about those
who already died?

1:19:25.634 --> 1:19:27.835
What do you think
they would want us to do?

1:19:29.504 --> 1:19:33.506
Risk our lives
to take revenge on their killers

1:19:33.508 --> 1:19:36.511
or do it to help
their orphans survive?

1:19:52.092 --> 1:19:53.728
We have to save the children.

1:19:56.564 --> 1:19:57.732
We will.

1:20:05.939 --> 1:20:08.876
<i>Germany, Poland.</i>

1:20:10.077 --> 1:20:12.110
<i>All over Europe.</i>

1:20:12.112 --> 1:20:16.150
<i>We're gonna be receiving
50 to 100 orphans a month.</i>

1:20:17.686 --> 1:20:22.356
Listen, we want to help you
take them out of France.

1:20:23.891 --> 1:20:25.824
Take them where?

1:20:25.826 --> 1:20:28.960
Even the allies have reached
their cap on refugees.

1:20:28.962 --> 1:20:31.496
What about Switzerland?

1:20:31.498 --> 1:20:35.336
You plan to take children
across snow covered mountains?

1:20:37.539 --> 1:20:39.373
<i>At least it's safe here.</i>

1:20:40.174 --> 1:20:41.507
They are not safe.

1:20:41.509 --> 1:20:43.643
If they are captured in the Alps

1:20:43.645 --> 1:20:46.845
we'll not only have to carry
the responsibility of a disgrace

1:20:46.847 --> 1:20:49.448
but we will also lose the
credibility and the funding

1:20:49.450 --> 1:20:51.686
we need to take care
of the rest of the children.

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:54.723
They are not safe.

1:20:58.025 --> 1:21:00.392
Georges, listen..

1:21:00.394 --> 1:21:03.462
...let us take a small group..

1:21:03.464 --> 1:21:05.834
...to see if we can get across
the border.

1:21:07.702 --> 1:21:09.336
<i>Please.</i>

1:21:26.487 --> 1:21:28.222
Shh, shh.
Shh. Shh.

1:21:33.327 --> 1:21:35.394
- No, Marcel. What..
- Shh, shh.

1:21:35.396 --> 1:21:38.332
- <i>Where have you been?</i>
- Shh, shh. Shh.

1:22:07.161 --> 1:22:08.393
<i>Go on, kids.</i>

1:22:08.395 --> 1:22:11.196
Do what Marcel and Emma
and Alain say

1:22:11.198 --> 1:22:13.999
and I promise
everything will be fine.

1:22:14.001 --> 1:22:15.668
Thank you.

1:22:15.670 --> 1:22:17.839
Thank you for saving our lives.

1:22:23.511 --> 1:22:25.778
- Thank you!
- <i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

1:22:25.780 --> 1:22:28.949
Go, go.
Let's go now. Out. Go out.

1:22:30.150 --> 1:22:32.451
Alright. Let's go.

1:22:32.453 --> 1:22:34.286
- Alright.
- Come on, kids. Let's go.

1:22:34.288 --> 1:22:35.723
Come on.

1:22:36.825 --> 1:22:38.793
- There you go. Here.
- Goodbye.

1:22:40.961 --> 1:22:42.227
<i>Go, son.</i>

1:22:42.229 --> 1:22:44.229
You and mother need to
get out of Europe as well.

1:22:44.231 --> 1:22:46.801
Go! Go!

1:23:06.821 --> 1:23:10.658
I understand there's a meeting
about visas for foreign Jews.

1:23:29.811 --> 1:23:31.378
No, I..

1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:10.482
The least guarded place at the
border is the end of this ridge.

1:24:10.484 --> 1:24:14.587
We're gonna go through this forest,
which is supposed to be easier.

1:24:14.589 --> 1:24:17.255
That will take us to a path
leading down the ridge

1:24:17.257 --> 1:24:20.494
down this mountain... to Geneva.

1:24:22.931 --> 1:24:25.430
<i>And there's a... a trail
down the ridge?</i>

1:24:25.432 --> 1:24:26.668
<i>Yes.</i>

1:24:29.369 --> 1:24:32.874
Emma... you can tell me
about Mila.

1:24:34.676 --> 1:24:37.779
I mean, I lost my father
and my mother.

1:24:43.017 --> 1:24:45.620
People always feel sorry
for those who die.

1:24:47.055 --> 1:24:49.489
They should feel worse
for those who live.

1:24:53.260 --> 1:24:57.530
There... there are lots of
beautiful things in life.

1:24:57.532 --> 1:24:59.499
If you could share it.

1:25:04.304 --> 1:25:06.674
Mila is no longer with us..

1:25:08.843 --> 1:25:13.047
...but we are here to make sure
that you are all safe.

1:25:14.682 --> 1:25:16.882
Mila wouldn't want me to be sad.

1:25:16.884 --> 1:25:19.821
And I'm sure your parents
would want you to be happy.

1:25:24.659 --> 1:25:26.493
We were never sad.

1:25:31.498 --> 1:25:33.067
Come here.

1:25:46.047 --> 1:25:48.082
I didn't know
there was a stop in Lyon.

1:25:49.617 --> 1:25:51.552
It should be only a minute.

1:26:14.008 --> 1:26:15.041
He's here!

1:26:15.043 --> 1:26:16.408
Who is?

1:26:16.410 --> 1:26:17.910
Barbie.

1:26:17.912 --> 1:26:18.946
<i>No.</i>

1:26:20.081 --> 1:26:22.748
- I have to jump.
- No, no, no. No.

1:26:22.750 --> 1:26:24.852
Okay, singing position.

1:26:37.431 --> 1:26:39.865
If he recognizes me,
he's gonna kill them all!

1:26:39.867 --> 1:26:42.103
We cannot just leave you. Here!

1:26:43.403 --> 1:26:46.605
Oh, okay, go. Go, go, go.
Come, come, come.

1:26:46.607 --> 1:26:48.843
Lock the door.
Lock the door.

1:26:51.746 --> 1:26:53.981
Everyone, "Ave Maria."

1:26:57.652 --> 1:27:00.753
♪ Ave

1:27:00.755 --> 1:27:05.960

1:28:17.732 --> 1:28:19.364
Where are you headed?

1:28:19.366 --> 1:28:22.168
We are going hiking in Jonage.

1:28:22.170 --> 1:28:23.602
Passports please.

1:28:23.604 --> 1:28:25.106
Yes.

1:28:42.790 --> 1:28:47.195
Mm, that is our young soprano,
Joseph.

1:28:54.068 --> 1:28:56.902
- What are you doing?
- Me?

1:28:56.904 --> 1:28:58.971
- You want them to laugh at us?
- Oh, no.

1:28:58.973 --> 1:29:00.908
I would, I would never.

1:29:07.949 --> 1:29:11.917
They are children.
I'm an educator.

1:29:11.919 --> 1:29:14.722
What good does it do
to teach them fear?

1:29:53.794 --> 1:29:56.128
- Come with me.
- Huh?

1:29:56.130 --> 1:29:58.132
<i>I said come with me.</i>

1:30:23.456 --> 1:30:24.959
<i>Spread your legs!</i>

1:30:32.867 --> 1:30:34.600
<i>Show me your pockets.</i>

1:30:34.602 --> 1:30:36.137
Show me your pockets.

1:30:38.940 --> 1:30:42.076
It's just a spoon
and here's money.

1:30:45.546 --> 1:30:46.514
What's this?

1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:49.581
It's a mustache.

1:30:49.583 --> 1:30:50.950
You're making fun of the Fuhrer?

1:30:50.952 --> 1:30:53.385
No, no, uh,
with all due respect, officer

1:30:53.387 --> 1:30:56.090
it's a,
it's a Charlie Chaplin mustache.

1:30:57.992 --> 1:31:01.560
I think it's important
to help the children laugh

1:31:01.562 --> 1:31:03.496
in the middle of this war.

1:31:09.370 --> 1:31:11.737
The girl..

1:31:11.739 --> 1:31:13.973
How old is she?

1:31:13.975 --> 1:31:15.574
She, uh..

1:31:15.576 --> 1:31:17.178
She is, uh, fourteen.

1:31:25.252 --> 1:31:27.419
You should help her
nurture her voice.

1:31:27.421 --> 1:31:29.190
It's very special.

1:31:31.392 --> 1:31:33.826
- That's what we are here for.
- Let me ask you something.

1:31:33.828 --> 1:31:34.960
Yes, sir.

1:31:41.769 --> 1:31:43.270
I have a daughter.

1:31:44.739 --> 1:31:47.573
How do you think

1:31:47.575 --> 1:31:50.911
I can help make sure she becomes
interested in the arts?

1:31:55.316 --> 1:31:56.851
How old is she?

1:31:58.986 --> 1:32:02.388
She is just a baby.

1:32:02.390 --> 1:32:04.456
I'm not talking about
what to do immediately.

1:32:04.458 --> 1:32:05.891
Hm.

1:32:05.893 --> 1:32:09.964
But as a strategy to build her
personality for the future.

1:32:18.706 --> 1:32:21.042
Try not to impose it.

1:32:22.943 --> 1:32:26.614
The more that you impose it..

1:32:28.182 --> 1:32:30.584
...I think, the more she will
rebel against it.

1:32:32.086 --> 1:32:34.219
Let her find her passion.

1:32:34.221 --> 1:32:36.121
Stay out of her way,
you know, if anything

1:32:36.123 --> 1:32:37.790
push her in the opposite
direction.

1:32:37.792 --> 1:32:39.526
Tell her arts are,
are for the weak

1:32:39.528 --> 1:32:41.862
and she'll want to
prove you wrong.

1:33:01.550 --> 1:33:03.150
That's very interesting.

1:33:05.786 --> 1:33:07.655
Very interesting.

1:33:10.958 --> 1:33:12.426
Thank you.

1:33:14.762 --> 1:33:15.930
Go.

1:33:16.565 --> 1:33:18.065
Now.

1:33:21.335 --> 1:33:22.436
<i>Max!</i>

1:33:23.804 --> 1:33:24.972
Thank you, sir.

1:33:39.521 --> 1:33:42.888
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Come here.

1:33:42.890 --> 1:33:44.557
Come here.

1:33:44.559 --> 1:33:45.693
It's okay.

1:33:47.562 --> 1:33:49.196
It's okay.

1:34:11.652 --> 1:34:12.987
Go slowly.

1:34:15.590 --> 1:34:18.957
Go slowly. Come here, Jerry.
Come here.

1:34:18.959 --> 1:34:20.959
Okay, come here.

1:34:20.961 --> 1:34:22.263
Okay.

1:34:24.698 --> 1:34:26.433
Come on.

1:38:05.754 --> 1:38:07.085
I'm fine.

1:38:07.087 --> 1:38:10.055
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

1:38:10.057 --> 1:38:12.326
- I'm fine.
- Come here.

1:38:13.661 --> 1:38:16.361
It's okay.

1:38:16.363 --> 1:38:18.063
Thank you.

1:38:18.065 --> 1:38:19.233
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1:38:23.270 --> 1:38:25.205
Thank you.

1:38:40.487 --> 1:38:41.922
Let's take a break over there.

1:38:42.956 --> 1:38:44.559
Okay.

1:39:28.736 --> 1:39:30.101
Okay?

1:39:30.103 --> 1:39:31.606
Thank you.

1:39:40.047 --> 1:39:41.716
You are amazing.

1:39:46.019 --> 1:39:47.421
It's because of you.

1:39:48.523 --> 1:39:50.923
What does that mean?

1:39:58.933 --> 1:40:02.002
When we met, you were only
interested in yourself.

1:40:07.842 --> 1:40:10.208
I'm still only
interested in myself.

1:40:23.257 --> 1:40:24.826
Put it out.

1:40:27.695 --> 1:40:29.094
- <i>Shhh.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

1:40:33.501 --> 1:40:34.901
Okay. Everybody to the trees!

1:40:34.903 --> 1:40:36.201
- Leave the bags.
- Leave the bags.

1:40:36.203 --> 1:40:37.404
Leave the bags.

1:40:38.006 --> 1:40:38.905
Let's go.

1:40:38.907 --> 1:40:40.806
- Come!
- Come on, let's move.

1:40:40.808 --> 1:40:42.342
Come on.
Let's move. Go, go!

1:40:43.277 --> 1:40:44.577
Go, go.

1:40:44.579 --> 1:40:47.045
- Go!
- No!

1:40:47.047 --> 1:40:48.948
- Are you okay?
- Hurry!

1:40:48.950 --> 1:40:50.816
Come on. Come on, quick.

1:40:56.189 --> 1:40:57.957
Okay, let's go, up to the trees!

1:40:57.959 --> 1:40:59.725
Up! Hurry up. Up.

1:41:26.588 --> 1:41:29.087
Okay. Look at me!

1:41:29.089 --> 1:41:30.288
<i>Look at me!</i>

1:41:30.290 --> 1:41:32.257
Look at me!

1:41:32.259 --> 1:41:34.426
Look at me! Look at me!

1:41:34.428 --> 1:41:37.630
Eyes on Marcel, eyes on Marcel.

1:41:37.632 --> 1:41:39.567
<i>Don't look down.</i>

1:45:07.307 --> 1:45:08.473
Halt!

1:45:11.579 --> 1:45:12.611
To the ridge!

1:45:12.613 --> 1:45:13.679
Let's go!

1:45:24.926 --> 1:45:26.861
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1:45:37.305 --> 1:45:39.705
- Is this the ridge?
- I hope so.

1:45:41.542 --> 1:45:43.108
Everyone..

1:45:43.110 --> 1:45:43.943
Jump!

1:45:43.945 --> 1:45:48.314
Go! Jump!
Go! Jump!

1:45:49.349 --> 1:45:50.583
- Go!
- Go!

1:45:50.585 --> 1:45:51.617
Jump!

1:45:56.791 --> 1:45:59.525
- I can't. I can't.
- You have to. Jump!

1:46:01.729 --> 1:46:03.095
Emma!

1:46:03.097 --> 1:46:04.697
Emma!

1:46:04.699 --> 1:46:06.200
Jump! Jump!

1:47:20.775 --> 1:47:22.143
Emma..

1:47:25.313 --> 1:47:26.745
Emma?

1:47:26.747 --> 1:47:28.781
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, careful.

1:47:28.783 --> 1:47:30.918
- Come here.
- <i>Bring her here.</i>

1:47:38.726 --> 1:47:40.491
Are... are all the children
here?

1:47:40.493 --> 1:47:42.962
- Yes.
- Bring them up!

1:47:42.964 --> 1:47:44.196
They can see her.

1:47:44.198 --> 1:47:45.463
Emma!

1:47:45.465 --> 1:47:47.032
Where's Emma?

1:47:47.034 --> 1:47:49.003
- Over there! Over there!
- Oh!

1:47:51.872 --> 1:47:53.040
Emma!

1:48:04.518 --> 1:48:05.918
- Sit here.
- Emma!

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:08.554
Emma! Emma! Emma!

1:48:08.556 --> 1:48:09.922
Emma! Emma!

1:48:29.944 --> 1:48:32.211
Do... do you hear me?
It's Marcel.

1:48:32.213 --> 1:48:36.382
It's Marcel.
Do you hear me?

1:48:36.384 --> 1:48:40.152
Emma, listen to me!
It's okay. Are you okay?

1:48:40.154 --> 1:48:42.354
The kids are all here.
It's okay.

1:48:42.356 --> 1:48:45.624
It's okay. Please, Emma.
Please, talk to me.

1:48:45.626 --> 1:48:47.962
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

1:48:48.863 --> 1:48:50.364
Emma?

1:48:52.566 --> 1:48:53.901
Emma, talk to me!

1:48:56.904 --> 1:48:58.572
Emma!

1:49:47.321 --> 1:49:48.523
Oh!

1:49:50.925 --> 1:49:52.093
Do you need help?

1:49:53.461 --> 1:49:55.160
Help? Wh..

1:49:55.162 --> 1:49:56.728
Where... where are we?

1:49:56.730 --> 1:49:58.197
In the Alps.

1:49:58.199 --> 1:50:00.668
Yes... yes,
but, but what... what country?

1:50:02.470 --> 1:50:05.005
You came all the way
from France?

1:50:05.973 --> 1:50:07.141
Fra..

1:50:08.142 --> 1:50:10.375
Switzerland?

1:50:10.377 --> 1:50:11.977
Yes, we are.

1:50:21.689 --> 1:50:24.723
We made it!

1:50:24.725 --> 1:50:26.660
We made it!

1:50:37.004 --> 1:50:38.706
Look at that!

1:50:41.108 --> 1:50:42.774
Let's go! Let's go!

1:51:30.391 --> 1:51:33.192
<i>He risked his life many times
by crossing the Alps</i>

1:51:33.194 --> 1:51:35.496
<i>to take orphans to safety.</i>

1:51:37.932 --> 1:51:42.134
He is personally
directly responsible

1:51:42.136 --> 1:51:44.271
for saving hundreds of children.

1:51:45.839 --> 1:51:49.376
And indirectly responsible
for saving thousands.

1:51:52.046 --> 1:51:55.015
He's now
one of our liaison officers.

1:51:56.350 --> 1:51:58.750
But he's also an actor

1:51:58.752 --> 1:52:01.086
and you are about to see his

1:52:01.088 --> 1:52:04.356
first official
public performance.

1:52:04.358 --> 1:52:09.394
Soldiers, remember his name..

1:52:09.396 --> 1:52:11.533
...because he will
never forget you..

1:52:13.901 --> 1:52:15.704
Marcel Marceau!
