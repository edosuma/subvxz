Oh, sweetie pie, it's a terrible
curse that goes back centuries.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.696
(knocking on door)

19:58.698 --> 19:59.697
No, no!

19:59.699 --> 20:00.865
Don't answer that.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.367
Man: We just need a place
to stay for the night.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.369
Oh, shouldn't we help them?

20:05.371 --> 20:08.806
Hey, in zero bc,
you can't trust anybody.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.074

20:10.076 --> 20:12.543
You curse them,

20:12.545 --> 20:13.611
Please?

20:14.813 --> 20:16.380
(goofy spring sound)

20:16.382 --> 20:18.416
(laser sound, then explosion)

20:18.418 --> 20:20.418
You're telling me
that really happened?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.553
They looked just like us,
didn't they?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.622

20:33.565 --> 20:36.634
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all,
folks!

You've just watched
the simpsons.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.430
From the island nation
of zephyria.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.099
Man: He wears a battle strap
and furry underpants.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.834
Other than that,
he's just a normal guy.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.737
My name's zorn,

with his ex-wife--

21:53.913 --> 21:55.646
I'm with craig now.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.482

you were actually staring
at my quadriceps.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.652

with his teenage son.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.255
Alan's relationship with zorn
is tenuous.

22:04.257 --> 22:06.090
It's weird
'cause he just got back.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.492

It's all yours.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.960

When he comes back, he finds out
that she has a fiancé.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.634
Zorn, this is craig,
my fiancé.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.870
Zorn, it's obvious
that you're applying
way too much pressure

22:19.872 --> 22:22.306
-To my hand right now.
-Uh-huh.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.874
Actually, it hurts.
It does?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.677
It really does.
You're emasculating me
in front of my fiancée.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.220
Zorn's kind of
a man out of time.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.456
-Come here! I'm gonna kill you!
-Oh, my god!
-Don't murder her!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.958
He'd be a great fit
hundreds of years ago.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.728
-You're gone. Put that away,
or you're gone. So gone.
-Okay. You got it.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.796
<i>Put that away!</i>
<i>No, absolutely.</i>
