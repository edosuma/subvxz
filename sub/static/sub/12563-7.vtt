00:00.870 --> 00:02.237
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.239 --> 00:03.572
I need your help.

00:03.574 --> 00:05.941
Would you be interested
in joining me in a venture?

00:05.943 --> 00:09.678
- What are you doing here?
- I've left your father.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.979
This is a pager watch.

00:10.981 --> 00:13.315
It operates on a secure frequency.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.217
When it beeps, you would
remove the SIM card

00:15.219 --> 00:17.485
from your personal cell
and proceed directly here

00:17.487 --> 00:19.387
- to Shadow Pond.
- I'm in.

00:19.389 --> 00:21.623
If you don't start changing,

00:21.625 --> 00:23.491
if you don't stop this behavior,

00:23.493 --> 00:26.161
you are going to end up unloved and alone!

00:28.798 --> 00:32.667
I went to see him. We had a fight.

00:32.668 --> 00:34.803
This is all my fault.

00:34.805 --> 00:36.938
I have to go.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.591 --> 00:58.393
Thanks.

00:58.395 --> 01:01.463
- We going to your apartment?
- No, a neutral location.

01:04.333 --> 01:05.900
I'm afraid there won't be time

01:05.902 --> 01:07.402
to get you settled, Hank.

01:07.404 --> 01:12.007
We have to begin work immediately.

01:12.009 --> 01:15.043
Well... Christina.

01:15.045 --> 01:18.079
- Boris.
- I can't believe it.

01:18.081 --> 01:22.017
Oh, um, meet Hank Lawson, my doctor.

01:22.019 --> 01:24.619
Hank, my translator, Christina Dumond.

01:24.621 --> 01:26.821
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

01:26.823 --> 01:27.889
I didn't realize there was a language

01:27.891 --> 01:28.990
Boris <i>didn't</i> speak.

01:28.992 --> 01:30.425
He has a few weaknesses.

01:30.427 --> 01:32.694
For whom will I be translating?

01:32.696 --> 01:34.229
For Dmitry Vasilyev.

01:34.231 --> 01:37.232
An oil broker I've had some
business with over the years.

01:37.234 --> 01:39.234
That explains why I was just informed

01:39.236 --> 01:40.902
your guest won't be arriving tonight.

01:40.904 --> 01:42.137
- No.
- Mm.

01:42.139 --> 01:45.273
He's being Dmitry.

01:45.275 --> 01:47.475
The negotiation always begins
with getting him in the room.

01:47.477 --> 01:49.244
So, Hank, you see
what you've signed on for?

01:49.246 --> 01:50.612
You're not even a doctor, are you?

01:50.614 --> 01:52.147
Me, uh...

01:52.149 --> 01:53.248
well, you've guessed it.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.983
Hank is here primarily as a fourth.

01:54.985 --> 01:57.018
You do play poker, Hank?

01:57.020 --> 01:59.220
- It's been a while.
- Uh-huh.

01:59.222 --> 02:00.822
Well, all we need is our guest of honor.

02:00.824 --> 02:04.092
So it appears that you're
at leisure now for this evening.

02:04.094 --> 02:05.427
Thank you for being here.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.795
Hank, we'll get you settled after all.

02:06.797 --> 02:09.631
Okay.

02:21.778 --> 02:22.911
What are you doing?

02:22.913 --> 02:26.381
Trying to impress my new boss.

02:26.383 --> 02:28.650
He's awesome.

02:28.652 --> 02:29.784
He <i>is</i> awesome.

02:29.786 --> 02:31.453
But, uh, all he asked you to do

02:31.455 --> 02:33.555
was cover Hank's schedule
for tomorrow. What...

02:33.557 --> 02:35.156
Jeremiah is all set.

02:35.158 --> 02:37.792
All right, enough, enough.

02:37.794 --> 02:41.229
Yeah!

02:41.231 --> 02:43.665
Are you really seeing
Brady Wilkerson tomorrow?

02:43.667 --> 02:44.966
Pretty impressive, huh?

02:44.968 --> 02:46.267
I would love to come along.

02:46.269 --> 02:48.303
Uh, you can't.

02:48.305 --> 02:49.270
Why?

02:49.272 --> 02:51.773
Because, you know...

02:51.775 --> 02:53.441
You're our new office manager.

02:53.443 --> 02:54.709
I mean, as much as I would love it,

02:54.711 --> 02:56.111
you can't go along every time

02:56.113 --> 02:57.679
I rub shoulders with greatness.

02:57.681 --> 02:59.247
Not that Hankmed's ever rubbed

02:59.249 --> 03:00.915
Brady Wilkerson's shoulders before.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.250
Or any other part of him.

03:02.252 --> 03:03.385
He's kind of a dream client, actually.

03:03.387 --> 03:04.853
He was one of our first retainers.

03:04.855 --> 03:06.755
No one's ever met the guy
'cause he's never sick.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.256
He's probably too busy making money.

03:08.258 --> 03:10.725
I know. He's an ex-boyfriend.

03:16.265 --> 03:19.267
You dated the guy who invented cashbox?

03:19.269 --> 03:21.102
No, we didn't exactly <i>date.</i>

03:21.104 --> 03:23.271
More just... spent a summer together.

03:23.273 --> 03:24.606
Oh, that's better.

03:24.608 --> 03:28.510
At space camp! We were 12.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.145
Hmm.

03:30.147 --> 03:32.447
- But I had a big crush on him.
- That's awesome.

03:32.449 --> 03:34.682
You had a big crush on the evil genius

03:34.684 --> 03:36.951
who made billions
counting other people's money.

03:36.953 --> 03:40.121
And now I have a big crush
on the sweet genius

03:40.123 --> 03:41.656
who built Hankmed.

03:41.658 --> 03:43.758
- Nice save.
- Yeah.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.660
What's this red flag next to Brady's name?

03:45.662 --> 03:48.129
Oh, those are for retainers
who are past due

03:48.131 --> 03:49.364
to renew their contracts.

03:49.366 --> 03:52.066
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:52.068 --> 03:54.469
Did, uh... did he have
a big crush on you too?

03:54.471 --> 03:55.970
Maybe.

03:55.972 --> 03:58.006
Maybe you should tag along then.

03:58.008 --> 04:00.074
I love this job.

04:19.728 --> 04:22.397
Father!

04:22.399 --> 04:23.631
Oh, father, thank goodness.

04:23.633 --> 04:26.134
Do you... do you know where you are?

04:26.136 --> 04:29.838
Yes.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.073
Now go away.

Fido!

05:19.669 --> 05:22.003
Payload? Is that you?

05:22.005 --> 05:24.372
Oh, my gosh, you look great.

05:24.374 --> 05:27.175
And you really haven't changed a bit.

05:27.177 --> 05:29.377
- Wha...
- Oh-kay.

05:29.379 --> 05:32.547
Hey, Evan R. Lawson.
I'm the CFO of Hankmed.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.583
- Hey.
- Hi. This is Dr. Sacani.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.018
I'm sorry, how are you guys...

05:37.020 --> 05:39.354
Oh, I'm... I'm working
with Hankmed this summer.

05:39.356 --> 05:41.856
And Evan is my fiance.

05:41.858 --> 05:42.991
Congrats. How grown-up of you.

05:42.993 --> 05:44.526
Right?

05:44.528 --> 05:46.561
Yeah, sorry we've never
had a chance to meet.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.396
But I mean, I'm not sorry
you haven't had need

05:48.398 --> 05:49.664
of a doctor in over a year,

05:49.666 --> 05:52.033
but believe it or not,
it's been that long.

05:52.035 --> 05:54.669
Well, you know, I was one
of Hankmed's first retainers.

05:54.671 --> 05:57.071
I do know, and in order
to show our appreciation,

05:57.073 --> 05:59.207
I brought you a renewal contract.

05:59.209 --> 06:02.410
Oh. Any special deals for charter clients?

06:02.412 --> 06:03.678
Especially healthy ones?

06:03.680 --> 06:06.014
Ha. Uh, Hankmed offers all our clients

06:06.016 --> 06:07.382
the highest level of care.

06:07.384 --> 06:09.284
All right, well, I'll take a look at it.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.886
Okay.

06:11.888 --> 06:14.456
Uh, we do offer wellness consults,

06:14.458 --> 06:17.091
and, Fido, you don't have
to be sick to call.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.359
Speaking of wellness, do you guys got time

06:18.361 --> 06:19.360
for some ginseng tea?

06:19.362 --> 06:20.862
It's amazing.

06:20.864 --> 06:22.597
Uh, shouldn't we complete your exam first?

06:22.599 --> 06:24.265
Exam?

06:24.267 --> 06:25.533
Your business manager didn't tell you?

06:25.535 --> 06:26.835
Wait, Ralph set up an appointment?

06:26.837 --> 06:28.703
He said you've been suffering migraines.

06:28.705 --> 06:30.071
Okay, well, he's the one suffering

06:30.073 --> 06:31.906
over how I've been investing my money

06:31.908 --> 06:33.408
ever since I decided to go to space.

06:33.410 --> 06:34.876
You went to space?

06:34.878 --> 06:36.911
I'm sorry, you went to <i>outer</i> space?

06:36.913 --> 06:38.179
Life-transforming trip.

06:38.181 --> 06:39.948
- What? Are you kidding?
- Yeah.

06:39.950 --> 06:41.382
Everybody should go.

06:41.384 --> 06:43.518
You know, I've always been
a space geek, just like Paige.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.620
- We dream the dream, right?
- Right.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.590
But actually going changed me
in unexpected ways, really.

06:48.592 --> 06:50.425
You developed migraines in space?

06:50.427 --> 06:51.759
No, no, no, I've had migraines
in the past.

06:51.761 --> 06:53.094
And, you know, I had a couple
when I first got back,

06:53.096 --> 06:54.896
but that was over a month ago.

06:54.898 --> 06:56.097
I want to go back.

06:56.099 --> 06:58.967
Okay, well, Dr. Sacani can do
a quick exam...

06:58.969 --> 07:00.869
- Yeah.
- Just a quick one, yeah.

07:00.871 --> 07:03.638
And maybe while he's at it, you can, uh...

07:03.640 --> 07:07.442
you can tell us... what's it like?

07:07.444 --> 07:09.344
You know what?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.279
You can't put it into words, man.

07:11.281 --> 07:14.282
And that is why
I'm entering the space race.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.750
You know, my vision...

07:15.752 --> 07:17.452
space tourism's for everyone.

07:17.454 --> 07:19.120
You know, it can't transform lives

07:19.122 --> 07:20.555
if it's not accessible.

07:20.557 --> 07:21.756
Wow.

07:21.758 --> 07:24.125
I just had an inspired... okay...

07:24.127 --> 07:25.660
you guys are engaged, you both love space.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.296
How 'bout you get married
on my company's maiden voyage?

07:28.298 --> 07:29.464
Talk about romance.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.866
A wedding in space?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.401
We aim to launch next year.

07:33.403 --> 07:34.569
- So do we.
- Well...

07:34.571 --> 07:36.170
- How perfect is that?
- Oh, yeah.

07:36.172 --> 07:38.139
Well, I guess it would
keep the guest list down.

07:38.141 --> 07:40.775
Honey, it would be
the first space wedding.

07:40.777 --> 07:42.143
Well, technically <i>Star Trek,</i> but...

07:42.145 --> 07:44.145
- No, that doesn't count.
- Also, it's fictional.

07:44.147 --> 07:45.647
- What? Spock married T'pring...
- No, no.

07:45.649 --> 07:46.848
But the wedding never happened, remember?

07:46.850 --> 07:48.283
Oh, my gosh, she made him fight Kirk.

07:48.285 --> 07:50.251
- To the death.
- How do you fight to the death

07:50.253 --> 07:52.120
with a broomstick with a pillow
on the end of it?

07:52.122 --> 07:56.291
The music was, like...

07:56.293 --> 07:57.725
Oh, my God, you wanna do the thing?

07:59.329 --> 08:01.029
- They were like, zhogg! Yeah.
- But it was more like...

08:01.031 --> 08:02.730
it was like slow, and they just circled.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.532
And then when they did it,
it was just, like,

08:04.534 --> 08:06.034
crack, crack, for, like, five minutes.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.902
And then the foot sweep, like...
oh, yeah. Whoosh!

08:07.904 --> 08:09.103
- Exactly like that!
- Hyah!

08:13.142 --> 08:15.643
Boris, you needed me?

08:15.645 --> 08:19.280
Yeah. I thought we might do
my quarterly blood draw.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.316
You're not due to be checked
for another week.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.918
- Are you feeling okay?
- Can we proceed?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.587
Of course we can.

08:31.327 --> 08:34.361
You slept well, Hank?

08:34.364 --> 08:35.964
Ehh, not so much.

08:35.966 --> 08:37.664
Being back in the city always
gets my adrenaline going.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.767
Pity.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.770
Better to be well-rested
before a challenge, huh?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.573
Look who's come to surprise us.

08:45.575 --> 08:48.509
- Ah!
- "Christinochka," careful.

08:48.511 --> 08:50.144
Yes, my English stinks,

08:50.146 --> 08:52.146
but I know the sound of sarcasm.

08:52.148 --> 08:54.148
- Dmitry Dmitrievich.
- My dear Boris.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.950
Oh, pardon. I-I shall come later.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.385
No, no, no, of course not.

08:57.387 --> 09:00.722
A nuisance that should have
been done by now.

09:00.724 --> 09:02.156
It's good to see you, Dima.

09:02.158 --> 09:03.925
Good to see you, Boris. Good to see you.

09:03.927 --> 09:06.794
I'm sad this visit... may I?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.631
Uh, will be such a short one.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.232
Now, don't start saying your good-byes

09:11.234 --> 09:13.101
before we've even had a proper greeting.

09:13.103 --> 09:15.136
- Uh, shall I come back?
- No, no.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.571
You might as well finish, doctor.

09:16.573 --> 09:20.041
Dr. Lawson, meet Dmitry Vasilyev.

09:20.043 --> 09:22.510
- A pleasure.
- Yeah.

09:22.512 --> 09:25.446
So what is so urgent?

09:25.448 --> 09:28.449
You make me miss
wild boar season in Provence.

09:28.451 --> 09:29.584
You were only reluctant to come

09:29.586 --> 09:31.152
because you owe me now, yeah?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.454
If you insist

09:33.456 --> 09:36.491
on talking business
before offering him a meal,

09:36.493 --> 09:38.326
he must retreat to the comfort
of his mother tongue.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.328
Tell him he can enjoy
a more leisurely pace

09:40.330 --> 09:41.829
at the Shadow Pond summit.

09:48.538 --> 09:50.838
But our respective associates

09:50.840 --> 09:52.874
don't share enough
common ground to merit a summit.

09:52.876 --> 09:54.676
Dima, Dima, Dima, you can at least stay

09:54.678 --> 09:57.445
until, um...

09:57.447 --> 10:00.114
Boris! Hey. Here, lie down.

10:00.116 --> 10:02.350
Lie down. Let's raise his feet.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.985
Here we go.

10:03.987 --> 10:06.187
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right. All right.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.189
- Here.
- No.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.457
No, this is good, this is good.

10:09.459 --> 10:10.958
My mother insists.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.961
I just feel faint. My... my pulse as well?

10:13.963 --> 10:16.030
Yeah. You may have had
a vasovagal reaction

10:16.032 --> 10:17.165
to the blood draw.

10:17.167 --> 10:18.566
- Yeah.
- Is he... is he fine?

10:18.568 --> 10:20.101
Yeah, yeah.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.536
Yeah.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.972
- Okay, uh, you rest, Boris.
- No.

10:24.974 --> 10:27.575
- We talk more later.
- No, I'm better, I'm better.

10:27.577 --> 10:29.844
Ahh...

10:29.846 --> 10:34.015
I think we...
drop the pretense, doctor, yeah?

10:34.017 --> 10:37.952
I am suffering from a...

10:37.954 --> 10:40.221
a condition.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.090
A genetic disease.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.128
I have kept it private.
You can understand why.

10:47.130 --> 10:49.964
So far, the symptoms
have not been dramatic.

10:49.966 --> 10:51.899
What is the gene
that is defective, doctor?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.235
It's the VCP gene on the ninth chromosome.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.570
Yes, that's...

10:55.572 --> 10:58.740
Sorry to hear that. Truly.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.510
So you say I must go to Shadow Pond

11:02.512 --> 11:04.212
because your time is short?

11:04.214 --> 11:06.748
Dima, none of us is immortal.

11:06.750 --> 11:11.719
I will see you at dinner. Okay?

11:27.871 --> 11:31.339
Father, I know that
you do not want to talk to me.

11:31.341 --> 11:34.942
But I also know how much
you hate hospitals.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.178
Your doctors are reluctant
to discharge you

11:37.180 --> 11:39.714
because you still need 24-hour monitoring,

11:39.716 --> 11:42.617
and you are at risk for seizures.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.019
But since I am a P.A.,

11:45.021 --> 11:46.621
they may release you into my care.

11:46.623 --> 11:50.691
You could recuperate at home
if I attend to you.

11:52.928 --> 11:56.063
What can I do for you, Mr. Katdare?

11:56.065 --> 11:59.167
Get my things. I'm going home.

12:02.838 --> 12:06.207
Wow, this fresh air seems to be doing you

12:06.209 --> 12:07.642
a world of good.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.310
Next time you plan to fake symptoms,

12:09.312 --> 12:12.213
could you maybe, I don't know,
give me a heads up?

12:12.215 --> 12:14.282
It was a necessary ruse, Hank.

12:14.284 --> 12:18.052
And I couldn't risk
any bad acting on your part.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.754
Oh, okay.

12:19.756 --> 12:21.989
Is Dmitry unwell, do you think?

12:21.991 --> 12:24.458
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say diabetes.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.294
Why?

12:26.296 --> 12:27.595
He was shaking when he came in

12:27.597 --> 12:29.564
and went right for a sugary drink.

12:29.566 --> 12:30.932
He has arthritis in his joints

12:30.934 --> 12:32.567
that made it hard to open the can.

12:32.569 --> 12:34.435
I suspected you might have
a knack for this.

12:34.437 --> 12:35.503
Oh...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.104
And diabetes is what I've heard.

12:37.106 --> 12:39.507
Apparently, recently it's gotten worse.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.709
I chose to expose my own health issues...

12:41.711 --> 12:43.144
and even exploit them.

12:43.146 --> 12:45.379
In hopes the Dmitry might
see you in action

12:45.381 --> 12:46.914
and seek help.

12:46.916 --> 12:49.217
I have no idea how consistent
his medical care has been,

12:49.219 --> 12:51.519
and I imagine he hides his weaknesses

12:51.521 --> 12:52.753
from his political enemies.

12:52.755 --> 12:53.855
I thought he was a businessman.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.125
Oil is never just about oil, Hank.

12:58.127 --> 13:01.128
There is a deal I want to make...

13:01.130 --> 13:03.731
And others would very much like
to see made.

13:03.733 --> 13:06.667
It could help stabilize
a nascent democracy.

13:06.669 --> 13:08.569
And, yes, it would make money too.

13:08.571 --> 13:11.372
Dmitry Vasilyev is the only man I know

13:11.374 --> 13:15.543
who can bring... certain parties
to the table.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.411
But not if he's ill and depressed.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.146
I need my old friend alive and well.

13:19.148 --> 13:23.517
So I'm here as bait... as medical bait.

13:23.519 --> 13:27.421
Let's see if he bites.

13:27.423 --> 13:30.391
I feel like...
did Picard ever get married?

13:30.393 --> 13:32.593
No, no. I definitely
would have remembered that.

13:32.595 --> 13:33.995
That's crazy. Um, okay,

13:33.997 --> 13:35.763
what about anything in <i>Deep space nine?</i>

13:35.765 --> 13:38.766
No... There was a wedding in <i>Enterprise.</i>

13:38.768 --> 13:40.768
Whoa, <i>Enterprise</i> does not count.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.603
- Does it, Payload?
- Definitely not to me.

13:42.605 --> 13:44.005
No, you're right, it doesn't.

13:44.007 --> 13:45.673
So I see no neuro deficits.

13:45.675 --> 13:47.808
There you go. You're not an alien.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.076
Yeah, I just wanted to rule out

13:49.078 --> 13:50.411
any possible causes of your migraines,

13:50.413 --> 13:51.412
but you seem fine.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.613
Okay, thanks.

13:52.615 --> 13:54.015
Hey, Ev, you got a second?

13:54.017 --> 13:56.651
Um, there's something I want to show you.

14:02.958 --> 14:06.560
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

14:06.562 --> 14:08.496
- You own a multi-axis trainer?
- Oh, yeah.

14:08.498 --> 14:10.665
- Who wants a go?
- Me! I could...

14:10.667 --> 14:13.234
- I mean... ladies first.
- You go ahead.

14:13.236 --> 14:14.235
Yes! Me...

14:14.237 --> 14:15.636
- Would you hold this?
- Yeah.

14:15.638 --> 14:17.204
Come on. Okay, now, step right here.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.073
Careful. Watch your head.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.808
All right, come in here.
Put your feet here.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.643
This is... this is literally...
this is a dream come true.

14:22.645 --> 14:24.812
Put these babies on.

14:24.814 --> 14:27.181
- All right?
- My God.

14:27.183 --> 14:29.617
- All right, you good?
- Yeah.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.985
Okay, now, this little device...

14:30.987 --> 14:32.053
develops balance and fortitude

14:32.055 --> 14:33.321
for experiencing weightlessness.

14:33.323 --> 14:35.156
Yeah. It's also a blast.

14:35.158 --> 14:37.892
Oww! I'm excited.

14:37.894 --> 14:40.227
- Okay, you ready for this?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:40.229 --> 14:42.296
- Okay, you ready?
- Yep.

14:47.337 --> 14:48.669
Yeah!

14:48.671 --> 14:52.940
Oh... Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

14:52.942 --> 14:55.242
You know, if his stomach is
anything like mine,

14:55.244 --> 14:57.611
maybe we better take a couple steps back.

14:57.613 --> 14:59.313
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

14:59.315 --> 15:02.316
Yeah! Oh... oh, God.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.485
- How you feeling?
- No, no, I'm good. Keep going.

15:04.487 --> 15:08.089
Keep going. Yes, yes.

15:08.091 --> 15:09.757
Okay, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

15:09.759 --> 15:12.660
All right, hold on.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.632
That was awesome! That was so awesome!

15:18.634 --> 15:20.668
I'm ready for zero gravity right now, man.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.604
- Seriously.
- Okay, who's next, huh?

15:23.606 --> 15:25.272
Yeah, all right.

15:25.274 --> 15:28.342
Okay, I gotta get out
of this thing... whoa!

15:28.344 --> 15:30.211
- Whoooooah!
- Watch out!

15:30.213 --> 15:33.347
Oh, my God! Ohh.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.982
Brady, oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

15:34.984 --> 15:36.817
Oh, yeah, I think I'm okay.

15:36.819 --> 15:38.986
Oh, God, I'm s... dude, I'm so sorry.

15:38.988 --> 15:42.857
What the... what is that?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.525
I have never seen anything
like that before.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.960
Wait, is...

15:48.530 --> 15:50.664
Dude, you <i>are</i> an alien.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.134
I... I think I'm all right. Oh, man.

15:53.136 --> 15:55.336
Why is his blood green?

16:04.741 --> 16:06.475
Evan, hey.

16:06.477 --> 16:08.510
Uh, I hope all is well with you.

16:08.512 --> 16:10.178
Especially because if it's not,

16:10.180 --> 16:13.448
you can't reach me, so... I don't know.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.385
Uh, I'll try you later.

16:22.126 --> 16:24.292
Finally a break.

16:24.294 --> 16:26.795
My bilingual brain is fried.

16:26.797 --> 16:28.864
Dmitry's English seems pretty good.

16:28.866 --> 16:33.068
But business with Boris is
all subtlety and nuance and...

16:33.070 --> 16:34.836
Why I need fresh air.

16:34.838 --> 16:36.004
Yeah, well, that should help.

16:36.006 --> 16:38.306
So I take it you don't have a light?

16:38.308 --> 16:40.942
I'm a doctor. No, I don't have a light.

16:40.944 --> 16:43.678
I am down to one of these a day, doctor.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.015
That may take more willpower
than just quitting outright.

16:47.017 --> 16:50.118
Willpower is no fun at all.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.622
I'd rather indulge in my addictions.

16:55.825 --> 16:58.026
I should see if Boris needs me.

16:58.028 --> 17:01.329
Um... ls he all right?

17:01.331 --> 17:03.598
- I...
- I mean...

17:03.600 --> 17:05.000
I'd ask him myself,

17:05.002 --> 17:09.104
but with his new domesticated status, I...

17:09.106 --> 17:12.140
I don't want to presume.

17:12.142 --> 17:16.011
Doctor... Do you have a moment?

17:16.012 --> 17:18.446
Uh, absolutely.

17:18.449 --> 17:19.881
Shall I translate?

17:19.883 --> 17:22.717
We can do alone.

17:22.719 --> 17:24.252
Thank you, "Christinochka."

17:31.561 --> 17:34.563
But what would cause
the blood to be green?

17:34.565 --> 17:36.465
There's one possibility.

17:36.467 --> 17:37.933
Vulcan DNA?

17:37.935 --> 17:39.501
Sulfhemoglobinemia.

17:39.503 --> 17:41.269
Okay, now <i>that</i> sounds Vulcan.

17:41.271 --> 17:42.704
That does kind of... that could be Vulcan.

17:42.706 --> 17:43.738
Yeah.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.240
Well, it's not.

17:45.242 --> 17:47.042
Have you taken any medicine

17:47.044 --> 17:49.077
that you failed to mention?

17:49.079 --> 17:50.278
Because medicines that control migraines

17:50.280 --> 17:51.713
can contain sulfonamide.

17:51.715 --> 17:54.416
Uh, well, you know, I've been taking

17:54.418 --> 17:56.551
300 milligrams of sumatriptan
every day, but...

17:56.553 --> 17:57.919
That's way too much.

17:57.921 --> 17:58.987
You can't take that prophylactically.

17:58.989 --> 18:00.589
Your blood is discolored

18:00.591 --> 18:02.557
because it has too much sulfur in it.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.226
Okay, but if my migraines return,

18:04.228 --> 18:05.827
no one's gonna let me back into space.

18:05.829 --> 18:08.163
Well, then, you can't go back into space.

18:08.165 --> 18:11.166
You have to stop taking those pills.

18:17.039 --> 18:18.373
I'll get a rush on those labs.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.441
And we'll follow up

18:19.443 --> 18:20.609
as soon as the results come in.

18:22.279 --> 18:24.846
So that was pretty harsh, man.

18:24.848 --> 18:26.014
The diagnosis is correct.

18:26.016 --> 18:28.683
Yes, but your bedside manner is not.

18:28.685 --> 18:32.187
You need to support the hopes
and dreams of your patients.

18:32.189 --> 18:33.488
He needs to stop overmedicating.

18:33.490 --> 18:35.991
Yes, but, Jeremiah, you made him feel bad.

18:35.993 --> 18:37.759
I did? I can't lie to him.

18:37.761 --> 18:38.760
Look, okay. I know.

18:38.762 --> 18:39.928
I'm not asking you to do that.

18:39.930 --> 18:42.130
I'm just saying Hank doesn't just go

18:42.132 --> 18:43.365
the extra mile,

18:43.367 --> 18:45.200
he finds ways to soften the blow,

18:45.202 --> 18:47.502
so feelings don't get hurt.

18:47.504 --> 18:49.671
You can't be so blunt, Jeremiah.

18:49.673 --> 18:52.107
You mean, how you're being blunt with me?

18:54.076 --> 18:55.076
I'm not...

18:55.078 --> 18:58.547
it's okay. I got it.

19:01.817 --> 19:04.452
Doctor, this...

19:04.454 --> 19:06.588
I need stronger.

19:09.725 --> 19:13.094
Ha... have you been diagnosed
with erectile dysfunction?

19:13.096 --> 19:14.563
Erecto what?

19:14.565 --> 19:17.799
- Are you ill?
- I have diabetes.

19:17.801 --> 19:19.568
Doctor says problem comes with this.

19:19.570 --> 19:22.237
It can... impotence
is common among diabetics.

19:22.239 --> 19:24.272
Not for me, may... maybe for you, but...

19:24.274 --> 19:26.074
Excuse me?

19:26.076 --> 19:27.842
Not before, I'm... I'm sorry.

19:27.844 --> 19:29.211
Look, uh...

19:29.213 --> 19:32.047
An old friend comes to visit tonight.

19:32.049 --> 19:34.082
I don't want to disappoint her, okay?

19:34.084 --> 19:36.885
Just some stronger, please.

19:40.623 --> 19:43.391
Please.

19:43.393 --> 19:45.927
How is your blood sugar control?

19:45.929 --> 19:48.230
Uh, do you use an insulin pump?

19:48.232 --> 19:49.331
Oh, no. I, uh...

19:49.333 --> 19:50.465
Oh, you inject insulin?

19:50.467 --> 19:51.600
I inject, yes.

19:51.602 --> 19:54.069
Quiet for a second.

19:54.071 --> 19:56.171
Okay.

19:56.173 --> 19:57.806
Ah, deep breath in and out.

20:00.077 --> 20:02.577
Depression can also come with diabetes.

20:02.579 --> 20:03.845
Again.

20:03.847 --> 20:05.780
And depression can cause impotence.

20:05.782 --> 20:07.115
Yes, yes, yes.

20:07.117 --> 20:11.219
Okay, please lie down.

20:12.356 --> 20:13.788
How many times did you try the pills?

20:13.790 --> 20:16.324
One... one fiasco was more than enough.

20:16.326 --> 20:17.459
Ah, for many men,

20:17.461 --> 20:19.394
these pills don't work the first time.

20:19.396 --> 20:20.495
You might need to try

20:20.497 --> 20:23.031
the pills several times before success.

20:23.033 --> 20:25.500
And the pills aren't a substitute for,

20:25.502 --> 20:26.901
you know, stimulation and...

20:26.903 --> 20:28.403
the... oh, whoa, whoa.

20:28.405 --> 20:31.539
Uh, bedroom tips... No need.

20:31.541 --> 20:32.807
Got it.

20:39.783 --> 20:42.417
Your liver's enlarged.

20:42.419 --> 20:43.752
Do you drink alcohol?

20:43.754 --> 20:46.388
Look, doctor. I am Russian.

20:46.390 --> 20:50.125
We drink alcohol, okay?

20:50.127 --> 20:52.260
I should draw blood to test
your liver function.

20:52.262 --> 20:55.397
The liver can affect diabetes
and cause E.D.

20:55.399 --> 20:57.365
You look at my blood?

20:57.367 --> 20:58.633
No, I send it to a lab.

20:58.635 --> 21:00.635
No. No blood goes out.

21:00.637 --> 21:01.670
We wouldn't have to use your name.

21:01.672 --> 21:03.171
No. It's too much risk. No.

21:03.173 --> 21:04.472
Listen, I can't prescribe for you

21:04.474 --> 21:05.740
without more information.

21:05.742 --> 21:09.210
Dr. Dolittle...

21:09.212 --> 21:10.211
What?

21:11.882 --> 21:15.517
Thank you very much. Please.

21:15.519 --> 21:16.518
You're welcome.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.761
Can you tell me who's president?

21:30.066 --> 21:33.268
Father, I know that you don't
want to talk to me,

21:33.270 --> 21:35.870
but these questions are
for your mental status.

21:35.872 --> 21:39.274
I can tell you my wife of 30 years

21:39.276 --> 21:42.477
has decided to become independent,

21:42.479 --> 21:43.878
like her daughter.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.348
That's my status.

21:46.350 --> 21:51.820
And your temperature's back to normal too.

21:51.822 --> 21:53.388
You need the nutrition, father.

22:21.384 --> 22:24.185
I understand you met with Dmitry,

22:24.187 --> 22:26.488
but no lab tests went out?

22:26.490 --> 22:29.324
Do you really need my lecture
on patient confidentiality?

22:29.326 --> 22:31.993
Let's skip your recitation

22:31.995 --> 22:33.962
of the hippocratic oath,
as well, shall we?

22:33.964 --> 22:34.963
Yes.

22:34.965 --> 22:36.464
Now, Hank,

22:36.466 --> 22:38.032
I want to warn you about Christina.

22:38.034 --> 22:40.435
Thanks. Why?

22:40.437 --> 22:41.970
Don't underestimate her.

22:41.972 --> 22:44.105
She's formidable.

22:44.107 --> 22:45.907
Yeah. Yeah, I've noticed.

22:45.909 --> 22:47.876
Did she say something?

22:47.878 --> 22:51.079
No, just... just that she was
concerned about your health.

22:51.081 --> 22:53.615
I was alerting you
to her poker skills, Hank.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.517
Oh.

22:55.519 --> 22:57.051
Oh, okay.

22:57.053 --> 22:58.253
What did you think I was going to say?

22:58.255 --> 23:00.188
I... uh, no, 'cause...

23:00.190 --> 23:02.290
What did she say about...

23:05.595 --> 23:06.928
Let's never mind.

23:06.930 --> 23:09.397
Mm-hmm.

23:16.506 --> 23:17.972
I understood that.

23:17.974 --> 23:21.009
- Doctor.
- Boris.

23:21.011 --> 23:24.646
So, um, Texas hold 'em.

23:24.648 --> 23:26.781
If you want to play my game.

23:52.374 --> 23:54.008
12,000.

23:57.446 --> 23:58.446
Hank.

23:58.448 --> 23:59.447
No.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.419
Good call.

24:07.857 --> 24:10.725
Set up a new skeet range at Shadow Pond.

24:10.727 --> 24:12.961
You can try the new
remington over and under, yeah?

24:12.963 --> 24:14.796
Don't change our subject, Boris.

24:14.798 --> 24:18.533
This word, embargo, it's a very bad word.

24:18.535 --> 24:19.801
It offends the shias.

24:21.670 --> 24:25.273
Oh, really?

24:25.275 --> 24:26.641
Not for me.

24:26.643 --> 24:30.278
Me? Yes.

24:36.952 --> 24:39.654
Gentlemen.

24:42.592 --> 24:43.858
Has been enjoyed,

24:43.860 --> 24:47.328
but I must call it an early evening.

24:47.330 --> 24:49.264
Toodle-oo.

24:49.266 --> 24:52.834
Good night.

24:55.237 --> 24:57.171
- Good night, Hank.
- Good night.

24:57.173 --> 24:59.307
Good night, Hank.

25:35.311 --> 25:36.911
What happened?

25:39.649 --> 25:41.082
What?

25:43.219 --> 25:44.285
Dmitry?

25:44.287 --> 25:45.353
Dima?

25:52.370 --> 25:53.836
What happened?

25:53.838 --> 25:55.771
He's in hypoglycemic shock.

25:55.773 --> 25:56.805
Is there glucose here?

25:56.807 --> 25:57.806
No! No glucose yet.

25:57.808 --> 25:58.841
He's been drinking.

25:58.843 --> 26:00.809
I'll give thiamine first.

26:04.314 --> 26:07.883
Okay. Good.

26:07.885 --> 26:09.084
Thiamine.

26:11.922 --> 26:15.758
Now we give him the glucose.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.761
And this should bring him around.

26:31.776 --> 26:33.776
He asked, "what are you doing here?"

26:33.778 --> 26:35.811
Uh, tell... tell him he drank,

26:35.813 --> 26:40.049
he didn't eat, and he exercised vigorously

26:40.051 --> 26:41.884
and put himself into a dangerous low.

26:45.323 --> 26:48.257
Supraventricular tachycardia.

26:48.259 --> 26:50.125
Your heart rate is too rapid.

26:50.127 --> 26:51.694
This should slow it down.

26:51.696 --> 26:53.329
Ow, ow!

26:53.331 --> 26:55.965
Ah! Ah!

26:57.401 --> 27:00.202
It's not working.

27:00.204 --> 27:03.706
- Boris, help me sit him up.
- Yeah.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.841
That's it. Good.

27:05.843 --> 27:07.242
Dima.

27:07.244 --> 27:08.777
Oh... uhh...

27:08.779 --> 27:10.846
Okay, just hold him like that.

27:10.848 --> 27:14.016
Uh... hold these.

27:14.018 --> 27:15.985
Thank you.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.190
We're going to dunk you, briefly.

27:21.192 --> 27:25.094
Yeah, we are.

27:25.096 --> 27:27.863
That's it, that's it.

27:27.865 --> 27:30.032
Okay, okay.

27:30.034 --> 27:33.102
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:33.104 --> 27:35.537
That's one way to get your heart
back into sinus rhythm.

27:35.539 --> 27:38.173
And it worked.

27:38.175 --> 27:39.708
- It did?
- Whew.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.210
Thank God. He'll be all right?

27:41.212 --> 27:42.845
Yeah, I'll stick around to make sure.

27:42.847 --> 27:45.014
But, Dmitry, you need further tests.

27:45.016 --> 27:47.049
I know your reservations
about sending out labs,

27:47.051 --> 27:49.952
but what if the lab came here?

27:53.758 --> 27:55.524
Well, we've definitely
found some advantages

27:55.526 --> 27:56.892
to having Hank out of the house.

27:56.894 --> 27:58.627
Hmm.

27:58.629 --> 27:59.895
Would it be wrong to ask him

27:59.897 --> 28:01.530
to move out after the wedding?

28:01.532 --> 28:04.133
You're not going to live on Saturn?

28:04.135 --> 28:06.268
So you're not too keen on
the interstellar nuptials?

28:06.270 --> 28:08.671
You picked up on that.

28:11.642 --> 28:13.942
What happened to the girl
who went to space camp?

28:13.944 --> 28:17.179
Honestly, I...

28:17.181 --> 28:19.381
I was never a fan of space.

28:19.383 --> 28:22.751
Too dark and cold.

28:22.753 --> 28:24.720
I went to camp because
of my crush on Brady.

28:24.722 --> 28:26.655
Oh, good. That's awesome.

28:27.958 --> 28:31.060
Fido and Payload sitting in a tree.

28:31.062 --> 28:33.495
What the hell are those nicknames anyway?

28:33.497 --> 28:37.066
Fido stands for Flight Dynamics Officer.

28:37.068 --> 28:40.202
And Payload? What's Payload about?

28:40.204 --> 28:42.404
Or were you just a little hefty?

28:42.406 --> 28:43.772
Ow!

28:43.774 --> 28:44.840
I was in charge of mission cargo,

28:44.842 --> 28:46.341
thank you very much.

28:46.343 --> 28:48.177
- Ow.
- Geez.

28:48.179 --> 28:50.345
And I...

28:50.347 --> 28:53.649
was a little hefty.

28:53.651 --> 28:56.285
No. Are you kidding me?

28:57.588 --> 28:59.321
I love that!

28:59.323 --> 29:01.523
So was I.

29:01.525 --> 29:03.158
I swear to God.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.960
At least we have that in common, right?

29:04.962 --> 29:07.229
What do you mean, "at least"?

29:07.231 --> 29:09.665
I bet we weren't
that different growing up.

29:11.469 --> 29:13.702
I would have killed too to space camp.

29:13.704 --> 29:17.639
Is there anything I can do to...

29:17.641 --> 29:20.409
make it up to you?

29:20.411 --> 29:22.611
I wouldn't mind a nickname.

29:22.613 --> 29:25.180
Like, Tiberius.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.949
You cannot give yourself a nickname.

29:26.951 --> 29:28.751
And it certainly can't be that.

29:28.753 --> 29:30.185
- It's James T. Kirk...
- No, sorry.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.487
It's Captain Kirk's middle name.

29:31.489 --> 29:32.688
Absolutely not. I won't have it.

29:32.690 --> 29:34.089
- No.
- James Tiberius Kirk.

29:39.996 --> 29:42.164
What's wrong?

29:42.166 --> 29:43.799
Sorry to wake you.

29:43.801 --> 29:46.535
I thought I might try another mango lassi.

29:46.537 --> 29:50.405
Of course.

29:52.408 --> 29:54.843
It looks like you have your appetite back.

29:59.750 --> 30:02.251
Father.

30:02.253 --> 30:04.386
I need to apologize...

30:04.388 --> 30:05.888
For getting angry at you

30:05.890 --> 30:09.625
on the day of your fall.

30:09.627 --> 30:11.360
I was insensitive,

30:11.362 --> 30:16.298
and I fear that I drove you to the edge.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.399
Literally.

30:17.401 --> 30:20.602
Literally?

30:20.604 --> 30:25.073
I am so grateful not to have lost you.

30:25.075 --> 30:29.111
Yes, my... desperate act failed.

30:29.113 --> 30:32.614
But maybe there's a silver lining.

30:32.616 --> 30:36.785
Or at least a mango lining.

30:36.787 --> 30:39.721
I'll be right back.

30:47.530 --> 30:49.565
Good evening.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.468
Sorry to ransack your bar.

30:53.470 --> 30:55.404
The one in my suite's empty.

30:55.406 --> 30:59.174
And they call this joint a five-star.

30:59.176 --> 31:00.709
Bourbon okay?

31:00.711 --> 31:02.878
Yeah.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.379
You read my mind.

31:05.382 --> 31:09.685
To a long day.

31:13.923 --> 31:17.793
Unless you're used to days like this.

31:17.795 --> 31:19.628
No.

31:19.630 --> 31:22.865
This was definitely a first.

31:22.867 --> 31:24.967
Firsts are good.

31:24.969 --> 31:27.903
I like firsts.

31:55.832 --> 31:58.467
You know...

31:58.469 --> 32:01.236
I had you beat
on that last round of poker.

32:01.238 --> 32:04.573
You know... I saw your cards.

32:04.575 --> 32:06.575
Now you know I can bluff.

32:06.577 --> 32:08.977
Now, what's that called in Russian?

32:16.487 --> 32:19.154
I don't believe you,
but I like how that sounds.

32:19.156 --> 32:21.390
There's more.

32:24.661 --> 32:27.462
Unfortunately, I'm here to do a job,

32:27.464 --> 32:30.265
and it's not over.

32:30.267 --> 32:33.669
Look, I'm barely keeping up
in these circles.

32:33.671 --> 32:35.938
Thrilling as they are.

32:35.940 --> 32:40.509
Says a man who saved a life
with an ice bucket.

32:42.246 --> 32:43.946
But you made that save bilingual.

32:43.948 --> 32:47.282
That's the thrilling part?

32:47.284 --> 32:50.953
That is to me.

32:50.955 --> 32:53.021
If you're worried about your boss,

32:53.023 --> 32:55.824
Boris respects the concept
of being off the clock.

32:55.826 --> 32:57.793
You can trust me on that.

33:02.598 --> 33:05.801
I'd like to get to know you better.

33:08.472 --> 33:11.606
Talk about firsts.

33:40.045 --> 33:42.613
Dima?

33:42.615 --> 33:45.849
Where are you going?

33:45.851 --> 33:47.418
What about your biopsy?

33:47.420 --> 33:48.852
I'm sorry, I must go.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.421
The lab equipment's arrived.

33:50.423 --> 33:51.755
Listen, you need to do this.

33:55.561 --> 33:57.327
- Dmitry.
- What?

33:57.329 --> 33:59.663
You're having trouble with
your index and middle fingers.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.932
Yes. Genius.

34:01.934 --> 34:04.802
Arthritis is a symptom
of diabetes, I thought.

34:04.804 --> 34:07.471
No, this doesn't look like
diabetic arthropathy.

34:07.473 --> 34:08.639
The only joints affected are

34:08.641 --> 34:10.574
the second and third metacarpophalangeas.

34:12.812 --> 34:14.411
Really?

34:14.413 --> 34:16.413
Sorry. These knuckles.

34:16.415 --> 34:19.049
I'm beginning to suspect
diabetes and liver disease

34:19.051 --> 34:20.516
are not your primary illness,

34:20.518 --> 34:22.953
but are caused by another
underlying condition.

34:22.955 --> 34:23.987
Underlying con...

34:23.989 --> 34:25.688
what is your doctor cooked for me?

34:25.690 --> 34:28.125
Dr. Lawson is his own man. Trust me.

34:28.127 --> 34:29.927
Look, if I'm right about
what you're suffering from,

34:29.929 --> 34:32.029
there may be a bronze discoloration

34:32.031 --> 34:33.362
beginning in your armpits.

34:35.835 --> 34:37.101
Would you like some privacy?

34:37.103 --> 34:39.837
Could we stop with this P.C. crap?

34:39.839 --> 34:43.306
Privacy, schmivacy.

34:51.649 --> 34:53.917
Okay.

34:53.918 --> 34:56.987
So what is this new disease I have?

34:56.989 --> 35:00.858
It's a blood disease called
hemochromatosis.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.193
It causes liver disease and diabetes,

35:03.195 --> 35:05.295
and can lead to depression.

35:05.297 --> 35:06.864
The biopsy will confirm it.

35:06.866 --> 35:08.132
And there's a treatment we can

35:08.134 --> 35:10.134
and should begin immediately.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.639
Okay.

35:22.347 --> 35:23.914
You want a smoothie?

35:23.916 --> 35:25.115
No.

35:25.117 --> 35:26.216
Eggs?

35:26.218 --> 35:28.652
No. No, no, no.

35:28.654 --> 35:30.854
Okay, what happened?

35:30.856 --> 35:35.225
Dear old Fido is not renewing
his retainership.

35:35.227 --> 35:37.561
It's all Jeremiah's fault too.

35:37.563 --> 35:39.830
How?

35:39.832 --> 35:40.931
You were there.

35:40.933 --> 35:43.333
He just blurted out the diagnosis.

35:43.335 --> 35:47.838
He didn't soft-pedal or coddle
or even sound sorry.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.141
First of all, Brady
wouldn't want to be coddled.

35:51.143 --> 35:53.677
And...

35:53.679 --> 35:56.013
And what?

36:00.919 --> 36:02.786
Really?

36:02.788 --> 36:05.689
Paige?

36:05.691 --> 36:07.357
I think you blew it with Brady.

36:07.359 --> 36:09.226
- I blew it?
- Yeah.

36:09.228 --> 36:11.495
When he asked you for
a discount, you didn't respond.

36:11.497 --> 36:13.597
Oh, my... he was kidding.

36:13.599 --> 36:15.265
And then he said, he'd get right on it.

36:15.267 --> 36:16.700
He was smiling.

36:16.702 --> 36:18.769
And "I'll get right on it"
can mean the opposite.

36:18.771 --> 36:20.904
I know Brady.

36:20.906 --> 36:22.573
And after reading that email,

36:22.575 --> 36:24.608
I still don't think he said no.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.944
Oh, really?

36:26.946 --> 36:29.846
"I regret we aren't a good fit."

36:29.848 --> 36:33.150
So, he's open to negotiation.
He just wants a deal.

36:33.152 --> 36:34.985
Paige, the guy's a gazillionaire.

36:34.987 --> 36:37.020
And he wants it to stay that way.

36:37.022 --> 36:38.789
So get your CFO ass over there,

36:38.791 --> 36:39.790
and close this deal.

36:41.694 --> 36:42.726
Look, uh...

36:45.231 --> 36:46.230
If I'm...

36:55.873 --> 36:56.974
Better, daddy?

36:56.976 --> 37:01.745
You haven't called me that for years.

37:01.747 --> 37:02.946
Are the damask roses blooming?

37:02.948 --> 37:04.548
I'll go check.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.250
No need.

37:06.252 --> 37:10.721
Perhaps we can walk out together
and look at them.

37:10.723 --> 37:13.290
The fresh air would be good for you.

37:13.292 --> 37:17.127
In fact, I'll open the doors now.

37:45.124 --> 37:47.624
You didn't jump.

37:47.626 --> 37:50.127
You were on a chair,

37:50.129 --> 37:54.298
spraying the bees' nests
when you fell, weren't you?

37:54.300 --> 37:56.433
I never said I jumped.

37:56.435 --> 37:58.368
But you let me believe it.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.871
I was afraid...

38:00.873 --> 38:03.807
You wouldn't stay.

38:03.809 --> 38:06.109
Oh.

38:06.111 --> 38:08.178
Uhh.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.247
Daddy...

38:10.249 --> 38:13.016
It wasn't just guilt that brought me here.

38:13.018 --> 38:15.452
I almost lost you.

38:15.454 --> 38:18.922
Do you really want me to feel better?

38:20.591 --> 38:23.660
I will not take sides with you or mother.

38:23.662 --> 38:26.496
That is for you to settle.

38:26.498 --> 38:29.466
And you will throw out that mental list

38:29.468 --> 38:30.901
of eligible bachelors

38:30.903 --> 38:32.836
that you have prepared.

38:32.838 --> 38:37.040
Otherwise, yes, I want to help.

38:37.042 --> 38:39.843
I have no list.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.778
Two nice men. That's not a list.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.848
Do we have a deal?

38:56.295 --> 38:58.795
How much more of my blood
do you need, doctor?

38:58.797 --> 39:00.697
We'll drain off about a pint.

39:00.699 --> 39:03.033
It's called phlebotomy or bloodletting.

39:04.036 --> 39:05.469
It will ease the overload

39:05.471 --> 39:06.770
of iron in your hemoglobin

39:06.772 --> 39:09.272
which is the source of your symptoms.

39:09.274 --> 39:12.242
Will it cure his illnesses?

39:12.244 --> 39:15.445
It won't reverse them,
but it will slow them down.

39:15.447 --> 39:17.881
Doctor.

39:17.883 --> 39:20.117
I'm grateful. Thank you.

39:20.119 --> 39:22.386
There is a catch.

39:22.388 --> 39:24.354
This bloodletting needs to be repeated.

39:24.356 --> 39:25.622
How often?

39:25.624 --> 39:27.124
As frequently as you can tolerate.

39:27.126 --> 39:28.892
At least once a week at first,

39:28.894 --> 39:31.728
and your blood will have to be tested.

39:31.730 --> 39:34.598
Dima, we could set up
a secure lab at Shadow Pond.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.135
And I could make Dr. Lawson
available for additional draws.

39:38.137 --> 39:39.436
Of course you can.

39:39.438 --> 39:42.005
Very convenient for your summit, isn't it?

39:42.007 --> 39:44.141
Yeah.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.023
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

39:59.628 --> 40:02.197
- This is interesting.
- Yeah.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.798
Hey, Brady.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.667
Hey, man.

40:05.669 --> 40:07.068
- Thanks for seeing us.
- Shh, shh.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.771
I have to concentrate.

40:09.773 --> 40:10.972
And you're doing it.

40:10.974 --> 40:13.875
You just went up a tenth of a degree.

40:13.877 --> 40:16.244
So, Jeremiah, what's going on?

40:16.246 --> 40:18.246
I thought Brady might control
his migraines

40:18.248 --> 40:20.281
using biofeedback
instead of using medication.

40:20.283 --> 40:21.549
How does that work?

40:21.551 --> 40:22.984
Well, I use breathing

40:22.986 --> 40:24.919
and focus to raise
the temperature in my hands.

40:24.921 --> 40:26.388
Retraining the vascular system

40:26.390 --> 40:27.589
can help alleviate the migraines.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.424
And as it turns out, having migraines

40:29.426 --> 40:31.559
may not prevent me
from blasting off again.

40:31.561 --> 40:33.461
If I bring a doctor with me.

40:33.463 --> 40:35.497
Oh, if you bring a...

40:35.499 --> 40:39.667
so, um, I'm... I'm not a doctor, per se.

40:39.669 --> 40:41.036
You certainly aren't.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.705
Don't worry, Fido, we will find you

40:43.707 --> 40:45.273
a medical companion if it comes to that.

40:45.275 --> 40:46.274
Thanks.

40:46.276 --> 40:47.776
Yeah, a medical companion.

40:49.746 --> 40:53.548
Well, I know I should go
the extra mile for Hankmed.

40:53.550 --> 40:56.584
But it's 62 extra miles to the Karman line

40:56.586 --> 40:57.752
at the atmosphere's boundary.

40:57.754 --> 40:59.921
Thanks.

40:59.923 --> 41:01.823
A little space camp stayed with me.

41:01.825 --> 41:03.625
Apparently.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.293
All right.

41:05.295 --> 41:07.996
You can stand down, Bones.
You fulfilled your mission.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.798
Bones? He's Spock.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.799
But he's a doctor.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.400
Oh, right, 'cause...

41:12.402 --> 41:13.735
otherwise, he's completely Spock.

41:13.737 --> 41:15.737
- Totally.
- Please stop.

41:24.947 --> 41:28.817
So... got what you wanted.

41:28.819 --> 41:29.851
Happy?

41:29.853 --> 41:31.519
Let's stop it, Dima.

41:31.521 --> 41:33.655
You're more desperate for
this deal that I am,

41:33.657 --> 41:35.790
and you know it.

41:35.792 --> 41:38.226
Come on. Get comfortable.

41:38.228 --> 41:39.661
Well, Hank,

41:39.663 --> 41:41.763
once again, you've exceeded
my high expectations.

41:41.765 --> 41:43.465
I would have been useless

41:43.467 --> 41:45.133
if there hadn't been
a patient to care for.

41:45.135 --> 41:46.301
Yeah?

41:46.303 --> 41:48.736
Ah!

41:48.738 --> 41:50.805
Sorry to reinforce stereotype.

41:50.807 --> 41:53.007
I had a packing meltdown.

41:53.009 --> 41:55.110
You're coming to Shadow Pond?

41:55.112 --> 41:56.311
Of course.

41:56.313 --> 42:00.148
There's still work to be done.

42:04.120 --> 42:08.590
And we'll get that chance
for you to know me better.
