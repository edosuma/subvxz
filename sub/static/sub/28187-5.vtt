WEBVTT

00:03.296 --> 00:05.215
We are a funeral parlor,

00:05.382 --> 00:08.343
serving Cairo, Illinois,
since 1863,

00:08.510 --> 00:11.638
when it was a flourishing town
at the crossing of two rivers.

00:11.805 --> 00:13.556
That was when we became
the funeral parlor

00:13.723 --> 00:15.183
for the colored folks
hereabouts.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.726
I'm Ruby.

00:17.936 --> 00:19.104
Ruby Goodchild.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.064
It's good
to meet you, Ruby.

00:22.148 --> 00:25.735
Ifrit, Grimnir needs
you at the Corn Palace.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.570
Ask for Old Iktomi.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.322
- To what end?
- Gungnir.

00:29.489 --> 00:31.074
You're getting Fire-eyes
and the fairy

00:31.241 --> 00:32.867
to fetch
your fucking spear for you?

00:33.785 --> 00:35.870
This is an instrument of death.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.623
That, my very old friend,

00:38.790 --> 00:40.750
is not your
motherfucking concern.

00:44.838 --> 00:46.631
If you truly want
your life back,

00:46.798 --> 00:48.883
I might have
another option for you.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.094
I will literally do anything.

00:52.554 --> 00:53.680
Mark my words.

00:53.847 --> 00:55.890
You're gonna need the Baron,
dead wife.

00:56.933 --> 00:58.768
I'll see you in New Orleans.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.455
Memento mori.

07:03.508 --> 07:04.801
Grow, Yggdrasil.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.886
Grow.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.808
You know there's a
bathroom, right?

07:11.974 --> 07:13.893
Yeah.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.271
You're pissing on a plant.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.483
On the world tree?

07:22.193 --> 07:25.113
Don't be disgusting.
How dare you?

07:31.369 --> 07:33.037
So, where are we
going today?

07:33.204 --> 07:35.373
Well, I have
things to do

07:35.540 --> 07:37.250
and people to see.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.586
But I shall be seeing them
and doing them alone.

07:40.753 --> 07:42.338
So you don't need my help?

07:42.505 --> 07:44.340
Oh, like St. Louis, huh?

07:44.507 --> 07:48.511
You know, maybe a day with Ibis
can put you back on track.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.596
He can teach you the ways
of the dead.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.682
I mean, you're dressed for it

07:52.849 --> 07:55.017
and, considering your
domestic situation, huh?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.187
Humans are dead
longer than they're alive.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.356
And we want them
on bended knee

08:00.523 --> 08:02.441
offering up their firstborn
and two more kids

08:02.608 --> 08:05.528
to be named later.
Do not wait up!

08:11.200 --> 08:15.329
You are comfortable sleeping
under the same roof as the dead?

08:20.793 --> 08:22.753
As long as they stay that way.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.389
Ah, look at you.

08:35.641 --> 08:38.144
Stop acting so high and mighty.

08:38.311 --> 08:40.354
I mean, were you fucking drunk

08:40.521 --> 08:42.732
the day they handed out
the real causes?

08:45.818 --> 08:48.571
Ain't that right, Judie?

08:52.491 --> 08:54.994
You're not better than me,
you little fuck!

09:09.926 --> 09:11.052
Whole...

09:11.844 --> 09:13.804
fucking country's a...

09:14.639 --> 09:16.390
...a lost cause.

09:16.891 --> 09:18.392
Oh!

09:34.325 --> 09:35.743
Jude!

09:38.996 --> 09:40.248
Oh.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.417
Fuck.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.920
It's you.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.630
Yes, it's me.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.049
Do not say, "I told you so."

09:50.216 --> 09:52.301
So Wednesday lied.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.845
See, that's "I told you so."

09:56.722 --> 09:58.307
You look...

09:58.474 --> 10:00.351
less decomposed.

10:00.518 --> 10:01.727
It's temporary.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.272
We need a more permanent fix.
You said you know a guy.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.442
You missed quite an
adventure gettin' down here.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.027
Oh, I'm sure I did.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.071
Stole a party boat
with the...

10:12.947 --> 10:14.532
pontoons.

10:14.699 --> 10:17.201
A party boat? That's how
you got down here?

10:17.368 --> 10:18.911
No, I hitchhiked.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.663
Boat sank.

10:23.541 --> 10:27.003
The further I get from that coin
inside your rotten innards,

10:27.169 --> 10:29.463
the more rotten
my luck becomes.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.052
Sure you're up for this?

10:36.554 --> 10:37.680
Yeah.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.940
That's a really nice shirt.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.407
Classy!

10:56.574 --> 10:58.326
You have no idea.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.787
Hell, no.
Get that bitch outta here!

11:01.954 --> 11:04.206
Calm down, Brigitte.
The girl's gotta eat.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.292
I'll cut your dick off
with a tomato knife,

11:06.459 --> 11:08.461
serve it up real nice,
we can share it with the world!

11:08.627 --> 11:10.629
Best not try to serve me that.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.923
Oh, shit. Mad Sweeney?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.842
I love you, brother,
but not that much.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.886
- Sweeney fou, mon frère!
- How are you?

11:17.053 --> 11:19.347
Okay, no, if that oversexed
goat sent you,

11:19.513 --> 11:21.599
you can just
turn right around,

11:21.766 --> 11:24.560
the Ghede Loa will not
be joining his fool war!

11:24.727 --> 11:26.729
Don't worry. I'm not here
for Wednesday.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.107
- I'd like a parley.
- Hi.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.611
She's lookin' good
for being dead.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.279
Can you help her?

11:42.203 --> 11:44.330
She can join the chef's table.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.875
After hours.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.668
The chef's table?

11:51.045 --> 11:52.463
Must be a slow fuckin' night.

11:52.630 --> 11:55.091
- Welcome home.
- We got work to do.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.093
- More later.
- Hey!

11:57.259 --> 11:59.178
Won't say no
to a night of drinkin'.

11:59.804 --> 12:01.347
Well, I can't drink.

12:01.514 --> 12:03.891
Am I supposed to sit here
and watch you all night?

12:04.058 --> 12:07.978
I warned you about the price
of resurrection, didn't I?

12:10.606 --> 12:13.567
Grimnir is late,
as usual.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.408
Alhamdu lil-lah.

12:23.244 --> 12:24.995
I find it funny.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.331
You find what funny?

12:27.498 --> 12:29.458
That you still thank him.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.213
I thank him for every meal
he provides me. Don't you?

12:36.674 --> 12:39.844
You know...I was born

12:40.010 --> 12:42.721
on Thursday
under a scorching desert sun,

12:42.888 --> 12:44.807
long before the first wahy.

12:46.851 --> 12:49.145
Years later, after the
Prophet's revelations,

12:49.311 --> 12:52.022
we Jinn, we were
given a choice.

12:52.648 --> 12:56.652
Convert to Islam or live
our lives as heretic demons.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.655
I chose heretic demon.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.908
After all you've seen,

13:03.075 --> 13:05.661
you still believe your god
is the one true God?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.663
Yes, of course I do.

13:08.122 --> 13:11.083
The first pillar of Islam is,
"There is no God but God."

13:11.542 --> 13:14.336
Thomas Jefferson said
all men are created equal,

13:14.503 --> 13:16.338
but he still owned slaves.

13:21.552 --> 13:24.847
I'm here to pick up 2 gentlemen
from the city of Sodom.

13:25.014 --> 13:29.018
Hey! That reminds me.

13:29.185 --> 13:31.145
You must have been there,
old friend.

13:31.312 --> 13:33.230
Tell me, how was the party, huh?

13:33.397 --> 13:36.567
Huh? I mean, Yahweh
can be such a prude. Huh?

13:36.734 --> 13:39.361
You're late.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.697
Keep your audience waiting.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.283
Something I learned from
my old burlesque days.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.494
My spear?

13:47.119 --> 13:49.538
Okay, gentlemen, climb aboard.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.582
The King of the Dwarves
awaits us!

13:51.749 --> 13:53.542
Uh, what about
the motorcycle?

13:53.709 --> 13:57.713
She will be just fine.

13:58.339 --> 13:59.507
Yalla!

14:05.179 --> 14:06.847
So, it's Wednesday
you worship, huh?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.225
No, no...
I don't worship anyone.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.811
I've been hanging in an amulet
around Odin's neck for years.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.689
And when it suited him, that
son of a bitch released me.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.944
I'm beholden to him,
but he's not my fucking god!

14:25.616 --> 14:27.409
What am I,
your fucking chauffeur?

14:27.576 --> 14:31.038
I can't have you two canoodling
in Betty's back seat!

14:31.205 --> 14:34.583
I mean, this is America.
We'll be pulled over!

15:17.209 --> 15:20.337
♪ All I ever needed was
a dope boy, dope boy ♪

15:20.504 --> 15:23.716
♪ All my niggas riding with that
dope boy, with that dope boy ♪

15:23.882 --> 15:27.678
♪ Cap, cap with some dope boy
Do it for that dope boy ♪

15:35.603 --> 15:38.856
You! Don't move!
Hands where I can see 'em.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.276
Shit!

15:53.662 --> 15:54.788
Hey!

16:44.546 --> 16:46.465
Jamaar Goodchild.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.842
Opiate overdose.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.970
His grandmother died
three days ago.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.847
Lila Goodchild.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.266
Her funeral is tomorrow.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.687
Opiate overdose?

17:00.938 --> 17:02.481
His wounds are posthumous,

17:02.648 --> 17:04.775
which happens quite
a bit here in Cairo.

17:04.942 --> 17:08.737
Has been happening around
here for the last century,

17:08.904 --> 17:10.864
to young men of color.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.700
Um...

17:16.453 --> 17:18.372
This morning, there was a man

17:18.539 --> 17:20.666
in my bathroom mirror
with the same wounds.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.251
I had 'em too.

17:22.418 --> 17:24.253
Ah, Froggy James.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.506
He provides plenty of dream
fuel under this old roof.

17:30.426 --> 17:31.885
What is he?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.887
Is he a ghost?

17:35.764 --> 17:36.890
Demon?

17:38.392 --> 17:40.519
Will James was an affable man

17:40.686 --> 17:44.314
whose tragic end brought
a simmering dynamic...

17:45.941 --> 17:47.901
...to a catastrophic boil.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.004
An eyewitness confirmed

18:07.171 --> 18:09.423
that Will was seen
crossing paths

18:09.590 --> 18:12.342
with a white woman
in broad daylight.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.144
When the young lady
turned up dead,

18:22.811 --> 18:25.397
the math was done.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.109
Surprisingly,
the sheriff in Cairo

18:29.276 --> 18:31.445
was an honest man
who staved off the inevitable,

18:31.612 --> 18:34.323
until a mob caught up to him

18:34.490 --> 18:36.784
and took William James.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.746
Froggy was lynched,

18:41.455 --> 18:43.707
shot, beheaded,

18:44.458 --> 18:46.376
dragged through the streets

18:46.543 --> 18:49.004
and burned for an audience
of 10,000 people

18:49.630 --> 18:52.758
who were having
the time of their lives.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.970
Cairo's dignity reduced
to a pool...

18:58.347 --> 18:59.681
of blood.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.858
Do you know why he was
in the mirror lookin' at me?

19:16.907 --> 19:18.617
Memento mori.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.620
Remember that you have to die.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.755
So, what're we doing after this?

19:31.922 --> 19:33.757
What do you wanna do?

19:33.924 --> 19:35.926
I don't know. Something fun.

19:36.093 --> 19:39.137
While you got your glass out,
want me to fill it for you?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.973
Cheers.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.909
Do I detect a little
trouble in paradise here?

20:02.452 --> 20:05.622
The Alfather knows all about
the vagaries of romance.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.417
Love who you love.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.460
Ask and you
shall be Embla'd.

20:12.129 --> 20:14.882
I believe in the violence
I saw in that diner.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.594
The pain and death suffered
by those immortals.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.179
May Zorya's star shine
on all of us.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.265
But that does not mean
I have faith in them.

20:23.432 --> 20:24.975
I do not have
the same relationship

20:25.142 --> 20:26.727
with them
that I have with my god.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.812
What Allah and I have
is something

20:28.979 --> 20:30.439
I can never get
from another being.

20:30.606 --> 20:32.566
Look, there are
many gods, Salim,

20:32.733 --> 20:35.611
and they're all as selfish
as that one is with his women.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.696
Don't admonish him
for having faith in a god.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.740
We need more like him.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.992
The only thing is, Salim,
monotheists like you,

20:42.159 --> 20:44.453
you've got too big
a piece of the pie.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.288
But if you do ever think
of expanding

20:46.455 --> 20:48.165
who you worship
and who you follow,

20:48.332 --> 20:50.792
let me present myself
as a fun-loving,

20:50.959 --> 20:53.587
yet serious addition
to your personal pantheon.

20:53.754 --> 20:57.716
Wednesday's the name;
good time's the game.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.511
Hm? What?

21:08.018 --> 21:09.561
You've been through a lot.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.939
- Can we at least agree to that?
- Yes.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.982
And...

21:14.149 --> 21:16.860
Well, you're mourning.
You're grieving.

21:17.027 --> 21:19.446
This is no time to make
big decisions.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.406
He's right.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.951
You should not leave Cairo
with me.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.329
I should not factor
into that decision.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.665
We will both stay here for now.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.583
There's nothing left.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.961
When word gets out that
Grandma and Jamarr are gone,

21:34.127 --> 21:35.754
the streets
ain't leaving me alone.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.923
They coming
to take what they want.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.384
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.260
You said that same shit
about Jamarr!

21:42.427 --> 21:45.597
Everything you said about
things getting better was a lie!

21:45.764 --> 21:47.432
You said to pray,
that it would help!

21:47.599 --> 21:48.850
It didn't!

21:49.017 --> 21:50.477
Look, let's...

21:50.644 --> 21:53.522
let's place
Lila and Jamarr to rest,

21:53.689 --> 21:56.441
and then we can discuss
this later, all right?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.527
It's not all on you, Reverend.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.320
It's this place.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.698
Cairo ain't home to me.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.950
It's hell.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.369
If these walls could talk,

22:07.536 --> 22:09.246
they'd tell you about
the Freedom Movement.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.123
They'd tell you
about James Bevel.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.543
They'd tell you about,
uh... Al Raby, Dr. King.

22:14.710 --> 22:17.671
People didn't always come
to funerals just to grieve.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.464
They-they came...

22:20.674 --> 22:21.842
Well, they...

22:22.634 --> 22:25.595
They came to organize.
They came to fight back.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.848
It sustained us!

22:28.473 --> 22:30.726
I am sustained by
the tranquility of love.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.812
God's love.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.024
Something
like that.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.864
So, follow my lead.

22:44.031 --> 22:47.325
And if Alviss does address you,

22:47.492 --> 22:50.037
compliment him. Or goad him.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.039
Dwarves can be tricky.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.042
Which is it?
Compliment or goad?

23:02.132 --> 23:04.843
Alviss, son of Vindalf.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.345
My answer is no.

23:07.512 --> 23:09.723
Don't you at least
wanna know why I'm here?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.767
It's no.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.228
It's still no.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.773
I know this Ifrit.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.108
But him?

23:20.275 --> 23:22.944
Manat? Hubal?

23:23.111 --> 23:26.364
No. I am Salim.
I am a mortal man.

23:26.531 --> 23:30.410
And you are very tall
for a dwarf.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.038
The tallest dwarf
in America!

23:33.205 --> 23:36.333
And that stature makes Alviss
the King of the Dwarves

23:36.500 --> 23:39.044
in this godforsaken continent!

23:39.211 --> 23:41.421
I like what you've done
with the place, Alviss.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.465
Time was when I
managed hundreds.

23:44.549 --> 23:47.094
Welders, mechanics,
even the cleaning staff.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.638
We were busy
from dawn till dusk.

23:49.805 --> 23:52.099
Now, I manage only myself.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.687
The swaying one.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.528
No.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.905
No, no, no.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.991
Your war is none of my affair.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.286
I've never been a warrior.
I'm a builder.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.372
I know, and I realize
the important work you do

24:15.539 --> 24:17.457
in this busy place.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.919
But as we were passing through,
I thought it only fair that...

24:21.920 --> 24:25.090
I should swing by and show
one of the greatest craftsmen

24:25.257 --> 24:27.134
of the Asgardian era

24:27.300 --> 24:30.011
- the wondrous Gungnir.
- Oh!

24:31.388 --> 24:34.015
She's seen better days.
Glorious days.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.268
She is indeed
in need of restoration,

24:36.434 --> 24:41.982
but only by one whose crafting
is worthy of Ivaldi's kin.

24:42.399 --> 24:45.610
I'm not one of the
greatest craftsmen.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.113
I bested my own kin, Sindri...

24:48.280 --> 24:50.866
...better known
as Spark-sprayer,

24:51.032 --> 24:54.536
to forge the hammer Mjolnir
and the ring Draupnir.

24:55.412 --> 24:58.957
If there's forging to be done,
I'm the one you seek.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.334
But...

25:02.419 --> 25:06.339
it's the runes that
require attention, Alfather.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.385
The runes that power
your 18 charms.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.722
The runes that anoint
the tip of your spear.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.350
Like all things,
runes fade.

25:17.893 --> 25:20.896
Rubbed clean by the friction
of time, the fading of memory.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.233
And rune carving
is Dvalin's domain.

25:27.903 --> 25:30.572
Have you seen
that little bastard lately?

25:36.870 --> 25:39.247
How... how did
our motorcycle get here?

25:39.414 --> 25:42.292
This is not just a motorcycle.

25:42.459 --> 25:46.254
This is Hildisvini,
Freyja's Battle Boar

25:46.421 --> 25:48.465
and sometime lover, eh?

25:48.632 --> 25:51.509
So, do you believe me?
Do I have your faith?

25:51.676 --> 25:54.262
You are not my God.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.140
He still believes in what
he was told.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.934
Not what he sees
or has experienced.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.393
The good little Arab boy,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.312
still doing what his parents
told him to do.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.231
What does it matter to you
what I believe?

26:04.856 --> 26:06.733
Here I am. Worship away!

26:06.900 --> 26:08.860
Because your truth,
it is not my truth.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.946
No, no. You're entitled
to your own truth, Salim,

26:11.112 --> 26:12.781
but not your own facts.

26:12.948 --> 26:15.283
Fact is, I have to get back
to Cairo.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.285
You did good, Ifrit.

26:17.702 --> 26:21.706
- Grimnir, do you need me there?
- Yeah.

26:21.873 --> 26:25.293
Yeah, I do.
You should come too, Salim.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.256
You misguided monotheist. Heh.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.260
You know, there's still time

26:33.426 --> 26:36.012
to join the party train
to Valhalla.

26:36.179 --> 26:39.140
We shall play
where the moon cannot see us.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.351
I have faith in you.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.815
Men only see
what they want to see

26:46.982 --> 26:48.984
and you are just
like them, Salim:

26:49.150 --> 26:52.862
Blind and stubborn to the truth
in front of your very own eyes.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.291
You still want to come with me?

27:10.005 --> 27:11.798
Thank you, my darlin'.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.341
Yeah.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.053
You're in for a treat tonight.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.598
- Best chef in the bayou.
- Glad you like.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.600
Thanks.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.895
I missed your cooking,
my friend.

27:32.027 --> 27:33.945
You smell a little rank, baby.

27:35.530 --> 27:37.198
It's the heat. Here, drink this

27:37.365 --> 27:38.783
Thank you.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.415
Mmm. Shh.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.382
Oh, that feels better.
Thank you.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.384
- Not bad.
- Hey.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.060
Oh, my God.

28:06.603 --> 28:10.148
- I can taste this.
- They miss the taste the most.

28:11.191 --> 28:14.152
Nah, they miss touch the most.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.892
You like that, baby?

28:47.268 --> 28:48.686
Uh-huh.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.356
Yeah. Uh-huh.

28:51.523 --> 28:54.234
Oh, knock it off.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.408
I need to turn this one's
clock back...

29:03.076 --> 29:04.953
...so I can retrieve
my property

29:05.120 --> 29:07.205
and send her back
to her husband.

29:21.428 --> 29:23.888
She's a cheater. Like you.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.598
Better and better.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.767
And death is her true love,

29:27.934 --> 29:30.019
but she betrays him also.

29:30.728 --> 29:32.897
Chasing after what
she cannot have.

29:33.064 --> 29:34.816
The favor is to me, Baron.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.235
It's not for her.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.114
Do we have a compact?

29:42.282 --> 29:44.242
I think we can make a trade.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.619
What kinda trade?

29:48.913 --> 29:50.623
I trade in truth.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.460
You give me truth,

29:53.626 --> 29:56.254
- and I give you what you want.
- Hm...

29:57.464 --> 29:59.132
Do we have a compact?

30:03.219 --> 30:04.304
Good.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.851
Time for business
and pleasure. Hm.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.813
Sweeney, mon amour?
Comin'?

30:20.820 --> 30:24.240
Resurrection is
Samedi's business.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.367
Yeah, we're not needed
here tonight.

30:41.716 --> 30:43.635
What's missing
from someone's soul

30:43.801 --> 30:45.887
that they can do that
to another?

30:46.763 --> 30:48.806
Why would he curse
his own people?

30:52.101 --> 30:56.189
Race is no simple equation
where one thing equals another.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.149
No one hates
the children of Israel

30:58.316 --> 30:59.817
more than the children
of Israel.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.319
What you say...

31:02.946 --> 31:06.074
...also happens to be true
for a dozen other ethnicities.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.992
But...

31:08.743 --> 31:11.079
when you are
continually reminded

31:11.246 --> 31:13.122
that you have
little to no value,

31:13.289 --> 31:14.707
it's easy to be convinced

31:14.874 --> 31:16.793
that all the rules are stacked
against you.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.130
Your worst fears are not
possible; they are probable.

31:23.466 --> 31:26.219
In the case of Will James,
I imagine...

31:28.096 --> 31:31.140
...as women pulled the rope,
he rose,

31:33.226 --> 31:36.145
looked out on a sea
of people,

31:36.437 --> 31:40.733
but only focused on those

31:40.900 --> 31:42.819
who looked like him,

31:42.986 --> 31:46.155
and felt abandoned
by his people.

31:46.781 --> 31:49.659
Who taught the black man
to hate himself?

31:49.826 --> 31:52.912
Who has corrupted
the entire world in the name

31:53.079 --> 31:55.957
of gaining power?
I'll give you a hint.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.753
He does not look like anyone
in our immediate vicinity.

32:03.715 --> 32:07.176
Well, praise Jesus
and four more white zombies.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.305
If it isn't Shadow Moon

32:10.471 --> 32:13.933
still hanging around asking
all the wrong fucking questions.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.060
And there it is.

32:20.815 --> 32:22.734
Why are you always
trying to piss me off?

32:22.900 --> 32:25.820
Better pissed off
than pissed on.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.239
Either way, all I'd need to do

32:28.406 --> 32:30.658
is have Wednesday tell you
it's raining.

32:40.877 --> 32:43.338
Now, why'd you have him
do that?

32:43.504 --> 32:46.007
Fuck him! Pussy!

32:47.258 --> 32:48.635
Speaking of...

32:49.886 --> 32:51.804
...I seen your cat.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.106
Now, where's the dog?

33:02.732 --> 33:04.567
Mm, business has been soft,

33:04.734 --> 33:06.527
so Jacquel took some time.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.532
Thrice the great magician.

33:11.699 --> 33:15.328
You, a conjurer of spells.

33:15.495 --> 33:20.416
You sit at the table
between good and evil,

33:20.583 --> 33:22.752
but you
and Mr. Jacquel

33:22.919 --> 33:25.171
bear no responsibility

33:25.338 --> 33:27.507
for Will fucking James!

33:27.674 --> 33:31.135
Ah, you believe
we haunt this town?

33:31.302 --> 33:34.097
If I was in the
dead body business,

33:34.263 --> 33:39.102
war would be music
to my ears, unless...

33:39.811 --> 33:41.521
Unless what?

33:44.148 --> 33:46.734
Please, continue.

33:46.901 --> 33:51.364
Unless I already had a way
to keep fresh bodies

33:51.531 --> 33:54.075
coming through
the back fucking door.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.289
I do not answer to you,
Anansi.

34:03.918 --> 34:08.172
If you are taking brown bodies
from this world,

34:09.382 --> 34:12.510
you are killing my worshippers.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.305
This cannot be. Hm?

34:25.606 --> 34:30.111
This... cannot... be.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.977
Will James?

35:45.853 --> 35:47.396
I am no one.

35:48.898 --> 35:51.484
That which I was
has been taken from me.

35:52.652 --> 35:53.986
So, you...

35:55.655 --> 35:58.074
...take other people's
lives instead?

35:58.241 --> 36:02.119
I release those who have
no hope to a life of peace.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.291
There's always hope.

36:08.167 --> 36:11.420
The way of the dead is
to know nothing of the living.

36:13.089 --> 36:14.423
Ecclesiastes.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.219
I know the verse.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.642
You worship Dante's Inferno?

36:25.852 --> 36:27.645
I worship death.

36:30.606 --> 36:31.816
Why?

36:32.483 --> 36:34.443
We wear the same skin.

36:35.528 --> 36:38.656
But you do not know the nature
of the land in which you dwell.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.034
Understand my anger.

36:45.329 --> 36:48.374
Killing me was the sweet
release they yearned for.

36:51.335 --> 36:54.213
We are victims chained
to their charity.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.719
They are deeply sorry

37:01.012 --> 37:03.890
for the primal disdain
they carry for us.

37:08.519 --> 37:10.229
You are not unlucky.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.065
You are unloved.

37:16.736 --> 37:18.487
Walk with my burden.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.158
When you share it
with the world,

37:22.992 --> 37:24.577
I will release you.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.247
Now go.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.676
My husband used
to look at me like...

37:41.761 --> 37:43.846
like I was the sun
and the moon.

37:45.222 --> 37:47.350
- And then you married him?
- Ha.

37:49.143 --> 37:50.728
And then I fucked it up.

37:50.895 --> 37:54.899
'Ey... You lived your truth.
That's no betrayal.

37:56.609 --> 37:57.735
Yeah.

37:59.820 --> 38:04.742
I have a long history of, um,
really shitty impulse control.

38:09.038 --> 38:11.958
You betrayed him long before
your marriage vows.

38:14.168 --> 38:15.878
Excuse me?

38:16.045 --> 38:17.588
You betrayed him
when you told him

38:17.755 --> 38:19.423
you loved him
in the first place.

38:22.385 --> 38:24.762
Poor, poor Laura Moon...

38:25.846 --> 38:28.766
So many lies,
she can not sleep.

38:29.433 --> 38:32.103
So many vows
she can not keep.

38:32.269 --> 38:33.896
Ha.

38:34.063 --> 38:35.982
Because you and Brigitte are...

38:36.607 --> 38:39.276
what, some fucking model
of a healthy relationship?

38:39.443 --> 38:41.362
Oh, Brigitte knows...

38:42.279 --> 38:43.906
that with
every breath,

38:44.073 --> 38:46.242
every cell...

38:46.409 --> 38:48.160
...I worship only her.

38:49.662 --> 38:53.040
The most beautiful,
interesting,

38:53.207 --> 38:57.461
sexy, and powerful woman
I have ever come across.

38:58.838 --> 39:00.339
And when she's not around,

39:01.215 --> 39:03.175
I fuck a lot of other women.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.013
Hm.

39:20.276 --> 39:22.028
One ingredient's
still missing.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.197
I can't help you
with that one.

39:26.157 --> 39:28.242
What? What,
what is it?

39:28.409 --> 39:30.828
Le vrai sang de l'amour.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.873
It's blood infused with love.

39:34.457 --> 39:35.666
Two drops.

39:36.876 --> 39:39.211
But I-I have to...
I have to find that?

39:41.756 --> 39:43.799
Right. 'Cause why
would this be easy?

39:44.675 --> 39:46.052
Look at you.

39:46.886 --> 39:48.763
Belly all shiny...

39:49.889 --> 39:51.515
...sweat on your skin...

39:52.391 --> 39:55.519
You're about as close
to being alive as you can be

39:55.686 --> 39:57.271
while still being dead.

40:00.316 --> 40:02.068
Tell me something,
Laura Moon.

40:04.320 --> 40:08.240
If I give you this bottle,
then what?

40:09.909 --> 40:13.245
What will you do when your skin
warms for another?

40:14.538 --> 40:15.748
For me.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.667
This is a second chance.

40:21.545 --> 40:24.256
What will you do
with it, dead girl?

40:25.716 --> 40:28.052
Hmm?
For payment,

40:28.219 --> 40:30.262
I ask only for truth.

41:47.256 --> 41:48.716
We honor the dead

41:48.883 --> 41:52.094
with flesh and sweat,
maybe a little blood, no?

41:52.469 --> 41:54.847
Give back for what we take?

41:55.014 --> 41:57.558
I see you and the Baron
still eating on the side, huh?

41:57.725 --> 42:00.603
We eat what we want.

42:03.731 --> 42:06.483
And I want you. Again.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.708
Oh, I see.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.710
Something's changed.

42:25.169 --> 42:28.088
You're too gone on
the dead girl to do your part.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.883
- The fuck I am.
- Oh, yeah.

42:31.050 --> 42:34.345
I can taste it. Salty.

42:34.511 --> 42:38.015

The good book says,

44:48.729 --> 44:52.524
"Walk by faith, not by sight."

44:53.609 --> 44:55.736
But try as I may, I...

44:57.029 --> 45:00.366
...can no longer walk through
this life with my eyes closed.

45:05.454 --> 45:09.541
Ruby, you were right
when you said I lied to you.

45:11.210 --> 45:13.295
I've lied not only
to you, but...

45:14.004 --> 45:17.174
I've lied to the entire town
of Cairo.

45:17.341 --> 45:19.343
Oh, yes.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.553
Every time I told you

45:21.720 --> 45:23.639
it was gonna be okay...

45:24.681 --> 45:26.266
...I was lying.

45:30.938 --> 45:34.149
The gift of faith

45:35.234 --> 45:37.444
in the face of torment

45:37.986 --> 45:40.614
was given to us when we
landed on these shores.

45:40.781 --> 45:44.701
It was there we learned

45:45.285 --> 45:49.998
to look away from the cruelty
inflicted upon us.

45:50.165 --> 45:53.419
Well, I can look away
no longer!

45:56.839 --> 45:58.715
I see a world in which

45:58.882 --> 46:03.095
little or nothing makes
any sense anymore.

46:03.262 --> 46:05.097
Amen.

46:15.899 --> 46:17.443
Leave here.

46:18.735 --> 46:20.821
And if you find somewhere...

46:22.781 --> 46:25.284
...our people aren't
catching hell...

46:27.828 --> 46:29.830
...you let me know where it is.

46:32.291 --> 46:33.959
I'll come running.

46:46.388 --> 46:50.267
If there is anyone who'd like
to share, come on up.

47:22.591 --> 47:25.302
In the Middle Ages,
they worshipped death.

47:26.762 --> 47:30.098
They knew its power over life
was suffocating.

47:32.768 --> 47:34.520
I learnt that from...

47:35.938 --> 47:37.439
...my wife.

47:42.736 --> 47:46.406
Now I look into the soul
of death and I welcome it.

47:52.788 --> 47:54.706
Memento mori.

47:58.210 --> 47:59.545
Amen.

48:09.846 --> 48:12.307
You know,
we're gonna try this once more.

48:14.101 --> 48:17.646
So, the 12 saffron-robed monks
chanted as one...

48:17.813 --> 48:22.276
♪ Have a little
melancholy baby! ♪

48:22.442 --> 48:24.361
No?

48:29.449 --> 48:32.619
America is the only
country in the world

48:32.786 --> 48:34.788
that measures its food

48:34.955 --> 48:36.456
in feet!

48:36.623 --> 48:37.874
Wow.

48:41.712 --> 48:43.839
Thanks for fucking up
my evening!

48:46.425 --> 48:49.052
Shadow Moon!

48:49.678 --> 48:52.848
Don't you look like pretty shit
on a toddler's shoe.

48:53.265 --> 48:57.144
Wednesday left you
in the capable hands of death

48:57.311 --> 48:59.354
and you lived
to tell about it.

49:00.022 --> 49:01.523
Tiger balls to you, Nancy.

49:01.690 --> 49:02.983
Alfather.

49:04.026 --> 49:05.944
Any of you selfish fuckers

49:06.111 --> 49:08.238
gonna elaborate on what
happened to me tonight?

49:08.405 --> 49:11.783
Magic is not real, Shadow.

49:12.492 --> 49:13.744
It's a trick.

49:15.662 --> 49:18.040
Stop playing checkers
with your life, boy.

49:18.206 --> 49:20.626
Mmm. Stop avoiding
the questions.

49:21.877 --> 49:23.629
What did Will James want?

49:24.838 --> 49:28.300
Maybe Froggy keeps his memory
alive to share the pain,

49:28.467 --> 49:30.385
the self-hatred, and absence

49:30.552 --> 49:32.804
of simple solutions
for our people.

49:34.348 --> 49:36.850
Or maybe he wants
what we all want.

49:38.060 --> 49:41.438
A tall glass of hops
fermented...

49:43.565 --> 49:46.777
...by yours truly
in the cold-brewed

49:46.943 --> 49:50.155
contaminated drinking
water of Cairo, Illinois.

49:50.322 --> 49:52.240
I will drink to that.

50:02.334 --> 50:03.585
Fuck you.

50:09.758 --> 50:13.762
Well,
cat got his tongue.

50:13.929 --> 50:16.682
Got more than his tongue.

50:16.848 --> 50:20.143
Sensitivity is such
an unattractive quality.

50:27.275 --> 50:29.069
The shit you be up to.

51:18.744 --> 51:20.120
Hey.

51:27.669 --> 51:29.129
By yourself?

51:31.423 --> 51:33.341
I don't know why you came
back here. I'm leaving.

51:33.508 --> 51:35.260
Where are you off to?

51:35.886 --> 51:38.472
- Away from you.
- What? No, wait!

51:38.638 --> 51:40.265
Don't make me
hurt you.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.893
Might I remind you
that we had a deal.

51:43.059 --> 51:45.103
You get your life back,
I get my coin.

51:45.270 --> 51:47.272
Well, I didn't get
my life back, did I?

51:47.439 --> 51:49.983
So, fuck you, deal's off,
I'm keeping your fucking coin.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.402
Like fuck you are!

51:52.903 --> 51:55.489
What happened, huh?
It didn't work?

51:55.655 --> 51:58.325
Oh, please. Bullshit.

51:58.492 --> 52:00.702
- What?
- Bullshit! Fucking bullshit!

52:00.869 --> 52:02.746
This is all Wednesday.

52:02.913 --> 52:04.831
All of this! All the way
back to the casino,

52:04.998 --> 52:07.709
he sends you to fuck my plan
and he sends you to fuck me?

52:07.876 --> 52:09.795
I knew you were his bitch.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.880
I didn't realize
you were his whore as well.

52:12.047 --> 52:13.965
What happened last night
is not part of some grand plan,

52:14.132 --> 52:16.051
you stupid cunt!

52:16.218 --> 52:17.761
They're death Loa!

52:17.928 --> 52:19.763
They fucked us!

52:20.889 --> 52:23.141
And I don't do Wednesday's
errands because I like him!

52:23.308 --> 52:26.353
I do 'em because
I fucking owe him!

52:28.313 --> 52:32.067
I hate that one-eyed cunt
more than you will ever know.

52:36.238 --> 52:38.240
You do Wednesday's
errands because...

52:38.949 --> 52:41.743
...no matter how much you claim
you want a war to die in,

52:42.702 --> 52:45.247
you're too much of a fucking
coward to find your own.
