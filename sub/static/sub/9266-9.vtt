- To you, to our fearless leader!
- To all of y'all, to everybody!

00:38.642 --> 00:39.689
Oh, Glenn!

00:40.532 --> 00:42.191
You wanna go to car wash?

00:43.393 --> 00:44.261
Sure.

00:44.524 --> 00:45.795
Why the hell not?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.227
You have a gun? Yes or no?

00:49.025 --> 00:50.066
There you go.

00:50.234 --> 00:52.443
I'm offering you
everything I've got.

00:52.770 --> 00:54.770
This is not just about football.

00:54.938 --> 00:56.939
- This is it.
- It's beautiful.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.382
How you doing, today?

01:06.507 --> 01:09.207
I'm Coach Taylor,
I was looking for Dallas.

01:09.578 --> 01:12.328
- Are you his sister?
- Yeah, he's not here.

01:12.589 --> 01:16.292
Hasn't showed up for practice for days,
I was wondering where he is.

01:16.543 --> 01:19.128
You wanna find him?
He's probably at Carrol Park.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.964
- He hangs there all the time.
- Carrol Park?

01:23.534 --> 01:26.194
You do me a favor, if you see him,
you tell him I stopped by?

01:26.319 --> 01:28.571
- All right.
- All right, thank you.

02:05.129 --> 02:08.344
I know you get this a lot,
but how accurate are your tests?

02:09.223 --> 02:11.073
But they can be wrong, right?

02:12.620 --> 02:13.453
Yeah.

02:14.315 --> 02:16.218
Okay, so I just take it again?

02:16.597 --> 02:17.550
Thanks.

02:24.528 --> 02:26.395
We'll hold on to this and...

02:26.840 --> 02:28.831
I'll give you a call
if something opens up.

02:28.999 --> 02:32.134
I thought we were gonna do an interview.
On the phone, that's what you said.

02:32.433 --> 02:35.691
We're not really ready
to make a decision right now, but...

02:35.982 --> 02:38.617
I'll definitely keep
your application on file.

02:38.903 --> 02:41.510
- "On file"? What does that mean?
- We'll call you.

02:41.678 --> 02:43.679
If something opens up,
I'll call you.

02:43.847 --> 02:45.844
This is the number
right here, right?

02:46.528 --> 02:47.828
Yeah, that's it.

02:48.654 --> 02:49.608
Thanks.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.770
Farmer's up.

03:26.945 --> 03:27.945
Excuse me.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.031
May I ask you a question?

03:30.156 --> 03:32.061
Looking for a fellow
named Dallas Tinker.

03:32.229 --> 03:34.697
You know him by chance?
He's a player of mine, I'm his coach.

03:34.865 --> 03:37.066
- Heard he would be out in this park.
- Tinker who?

03:37.386 --> 03:38.486
Tinkerbell?

03:39.269 --> 03:40.937
Y'all do me favor if you would...

03:41.105 --> 03:43.639
If you see him, just tell him
his coach is looking for him.

03:44.172 --> 03:46.375
Look like some damn messager
to you, Coach?

04:07.239 --> 04:09.623
Everybody get back, please!
Sheriff department.

04:09.748 --> 04:13.448
43 County, we're out in Carrol
and we have a shooting victim...

04:17.567 --> 04:19.175
Everybody step back.
Step back!

04:20.279 --> 04:22.812
Are there any witnesses around here?
You guys seen anything?

04:23.056 --> 04:24.951
Can you tell me how old you are?

04:25.924 --> 04:28.150
Great.
Are you having any trouble breathing?

04:28.318 --> 04:30.586
Notify EMS
that he's having trouble breathing.

05:24.419 --> 05:26.008
Hey, hon.
Good morning.

05:27.153 --> 05:29.145
- How are ya?
- Good. Where is dad?

05:29.457 --> 05:31.438
He had to go down
the police station,

05:31.563 --> 05:34.383
you know, for that whole thing
that happened last night.

05:35.343 --> 05:38.653
Feel like you guys are never in the same
place at the same time anymore.

05:39.181 --> 05:40.606
I kind of do, too.

05:42.784 --> 05:45.535
Are you excited
for Habitat for Humanity today?

05:48.322 --> 05:49.599
I'm getting there.

05:50.378 --> 05:52.602
Good.
Think you're gonna enjoy it.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.456
Yeah, you should know, you're the one
who forced me to sign up for it.

05:55.581 --> 05:59.130
I did not force you to sign... No!

05:59.316 --> 06:03.179
You did. "Juls, it's gonna look great on
your applications, you should sign up."

06:03.347 --> 06:06.248
It's gonna be great
for your college applications.

06:07.036 --> 06:08.551
Get ready. We got to go.

06:09.715 --> 06:11.120
How did that boy do last night?

06:11.823 --> 06:13.573
The kid is gonna be okay.

06:13.986 --> 06:15.549
Let me ask you something, Coach.

06:15.674 --> 06:18.289
I saw your name on the witness list.

06:18.526 --> 06:20.930
- What were you doing there?
- Got 1 of my players not showing up

06:21.098 --> 06:23.351
for practice,
I was looking for him, he's fine.

06:23.476 --> 06:25.620
Said that, that park I saw
was that dangerous at night?

06:25.745 --> 06:28.371
Look, Coach,
you can't man a park 24/7.

06:28.539 --> 06:31.634
I'm not asking you that. I got
a lot of players that live in the area.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.022
So I'm trying to find out

06:33.147 --> 06:35.745
if we can get one extra person down
there and get the lights turned on.

06:35.913 --> 06:37.713
Look, Coach,
I completely urderstand,

06:37.881 --> 06:41.183
but I've been to Mayor Rodell myself
and she can't even do anything for me.

06:41.308 --> 06:44.028
Now it's all about
a matter of resources, all right?

06:44.472 --> 06:45.755
And we just ain't got them.

06:47.103 --> 06:49.332
It's always about the money,
isn't it?

06:57.190 --> 06:58.390
How you doing?

06:58.969 --> 07:00.569
I was due for rinse,

07:00.737 --> 07:03.454
so I had to borrow your shower,
if that's cool.

07:05.121 --> 07:05.947
Cool.

07:07.497 --> 07:08.597
Hey, just...

07:11.223 --> 07:12.623
Are you all right?

07:13.077 --> 07:14.127
Yeah, fine.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.780
Good times.

07:20.950 --> 07:21.992
Hey, Coach!

07:22.117 --> 07:23.267
Coach Taylor.

07:24.028 --> 07:26.429
- Hey, Glenn, how are you?
- Good. How you doing?

07:26.597 --> 07:28.831
- How's everything on the west side?
- It's good.

07:28.999 --> 07:31.667
- Sorry to drop in on you like this.
- It's all right, what do you need?

07:32.282 --> 07:33.282
Look, I...

07:33.695 --> 07:36.639
I just wanna say I really appreciate you
just taking the high road

07:36.807 --> 07:38.016
like this, I really do.

07:38.141 --> 07:40.810
I mean, I'm a science teacher,
I know how these things work

07:40.978 --> 07:43.145
with adrenaline and hormones...
And by all accounts,

07:43.313 --> 07:45.681
you got every right to just deck me,
just tell me go to hell...

07:45.849 --> 07:47.316
What are you talking about?

07:48.288 --> 07:49.327
Does she not...

07:50.705 --> 07:52.722
Did Tami not tell you
what happened the other night?

07:53.875 --> 07:54.701
No...

08:00.209 --> 08:02.333
This is a little awkward, I just...

08:04.545 --> 08:05.995
I kissed your wife.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.546
Please, please don't hit me.
I just...

08:08.671 --> 08:11.907
I came here to apologize
and to explain myself, I...

08:12.075 --> 08:14.343
We were at this karaoke bar,
everybody having a great time,

08:14.655 --> 08:18.214
and I just got a little excited, boy,
I was walking her to her cab, and...

08:18.382 --> 08:20.350
next thing I know, my lips are
on hers, I thought,

08:20.475 --> 08:22.587
"Wow, my mouth
is on Tami Taylor's mouth."

08:22.712 --> 08:25.364
And she pushed me back, and she told me,
"That can never happen again."

08:25.489 --> 08:27.089
And that's why I came here, Coach.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.879
I had to get if off my chest.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.501
I don't know what else to say.

08:42.294 --> 08:44.073
I guess I'll see you around
at the game

08:44.241 --> 08:46.275
- or something.
- You'll see me sooner than that.

08:48.174 --> 08:49.174
I'm sorry.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.013
I'm really sorry, I'm sorry.

08:54.941 --> 08:56.218
I appreciate you coming in.

08:57.110 --> 09:00.556
Well, I needed to talk to you
because we had a problem with J.D.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.593
He called his math teacher a bitch,

09:03.862 --> 09:05.762
and was disrespectful to me.

09:06.027 --> 09:08.230
And he will be in detention
for the next week,

09:08.398 --> 09:10.512
which means he will miss
some practice.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.535
I wanted to let you know that.

09:15.694 --> 09:17.940
Well, I think that's for the best.

09:19.445 --> 09:21.095
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

09:22.188 --> 09:24.638
J.D. has been
a real handful, of late.

09:25.249 --> 09:27.918
I tried to talk to him,
he won't listen to me...

09:28.726 --> 09:32.426
You know, he's just cannot go around
treating people like crap.

09:34.384 --> 09:35.633
Well, that's right.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.910
There need to be consequences.

09:38.095 --> 09:39.729
There do need to be consequences.

09:40.742 --> 09:41.931
I mean, he has...

09:42.341 --> 09:44.900
acted out a lot since the split.

09:45.068 --> 09:46.810
I'm not trying to make excuses...

09:46.935 --> 09:49.029
When you say "split", I'm sorry...

09:49.508 --> 09:51.307
You don't mean you and Katie?

09:53.410 --> 09:55.715
- You didn't know?
- No, I'm so sorry.

09:57.574 --> 09:59.081
Feels like everybody in town knows.

09:59.249 --> 10:01.249
No, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

10:04.297 --> 10:05.797
It happens, I guess.

10:07.322 --> 10:09.425
I guess it can happen to anybody.

10:12.563 --> 10:13.663
Yes, it can.

10:14.998 --> 10:17.333
One, two, three

10:17.770 --> 10:20.953
four, five, six, seven...

10:21.342 --> 10:24.440
- You talked to Mayor Rodell lately?
- No, not too much.

10:24.608 --> 10:26.670
She's not too happy
with me after that...

10:27.013 --> 10:28.444
mailbox incident.

10:29.635 --> 10:31.835
Was over at Carrol Pak last night.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.730
12-year-old kid got shot over there.

10:34.985 --> 10:37.620
Most of them are living in that area.
I wanted to talk to the mayor,

10:37.788 --> 10:41.724
- maybe get the lights turned on.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Eric.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.273
But that's a good idea.

10:43.398 --> 10:46.295
- Take back the park, I love that.
- I'm not trying to take anything back.

10:46.463 --> 10:49.065
- Just want to get it cleaned up a bit.
- Okay, I'll talk to her.

10:49.374 --> 10:51.033
Maybe we can raise money.

10:51.201 --> 10:52.841
What? You said she was mad at you.

10:52.966 --> 10:54.980
Well, she is.
But you know, we go back.

10:55.210 --> 10:57.296
We have a little history, you know?

10:57.421 --> 10:59.241
Before she starts playing
for the other team.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.043
You know what I mean?

11:03.267 --> 11:05.917
- I'll talk to her.
- All right, let's go!

11:10.755 --> 11:12.688
It's looking good, Julie.
Nice work.

11:13.608 --> 11:14.565
Thanks.

11:15.857 --> 11:16.859
It's Ryan, right?

11:18.673 --> 11:20.382
It's harder the first day.

11:20.910 --> 11:21.931
To work out.

11:23.588 --> 11:26.198
It's a lot harder to Habitat
*** than I thought.

11:26.323 --> 11:27.723
I know, it can be.

11:28.301 --> 11:30.016
It's kind of why
I hate to tell you this,

11:30.141 --> 11:32.028
but this is the closet,

11:32.776 --> 11:35.244
and you were supposed
to tile the bathroom.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.706
- You're joking?
- It's an easy mistake to make.

11:39.831 --> 11:41.689
It happens a lot
when we move this fast.

11:41.814 --> 11:44.325
So what? I take it all out and...

11:44.964 --> 11:46.222
retile over there?

11:46.804 --> 11:48.057
That's pretty much it.

11:50.327 --> 11:53.304
I'm sorry, I should have been
more focused on it, I just have....

11:53.605 --> 11:56.098
so much many things going on
right now and I just...

11:56.266 --> 11:57.416
I don't know.

11:57.966 --> 11:59.874
Well, building is a little like...

12:00.571 --> 12:02.204
meditation, you have to...

12:02.372 --> 12:04.204
keep your brain in the moment.

12:04.726 --> 12:06.475
Believe me, I learned the hard way.

12:08.164 --> 12:09.211
No worries, though.

12:09.379 --> 12:12.763
I'm gonna give you a hand,
we're gonna get this done in no time.

12:13.426 --> 12:14.656
It's the fun part.

12:14.781 --> 12:15.735
Thanks.

12:21.258 --> 12:22.608
You got a second?

12:29.497 --> 12:30.499
What you need?

12:32.090 --> 12:33.169
I need some cash.

12:34.410 --> 12:36.427
I need to bring it in
like yesterday.

12:36.908 --> 12:38.758
I've been trying to find some work,

12:39.055 --> 12:41.777
but there's not a lot of jobs out there
that's cool with me having a record.

12:43.255 --> 12:45.419
And I was wondering
if you could help.

12:46.303 --> 12:48.084
You're asking me
to look around for you?

12:48.861 --> 12:50.575
If you hear of anything.

12:51.870 --> 12:53.562
An application has references.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.279
And I wanted to know if...

12:55.588 --> 12:58.814
you were cool with me giving your number
as a reference, if they call, you...

12:59.124 --> 13:00.994
just say I'm playing
football for you,

13:01.119 --> 13:03.199
and I'm doing good.

13:05.399 --> 13:06.399
And stuff.

13:08.685 --> 13:09.805
You do that

13:09.973 --> 13:11.568
and I'll look around for you.

13:11.915 --> 13:12.642
Really?

13:12.908 --> 13:15.344
You ask me to ask around for you,
I'm gonna ask around for you.

13:18.350 --> 13:19.200
Thanks.

13:19.919 --> 13:21.017
I appreciate it.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.835
I need to talk to you.

13:43.150 --> 13:46.850
Yeah, it's funny because I wanted
to talk to for a while, actually.

13:47.239 --> 13:50.624
- I'm kind of feeling like we're just...
- I've got some bad news, okay?

13:51.084 --> 13:52.179
I'm pregnant,

13:52.304 --> 13:54.584
and it's yours,
and I need an abortion.

13:55.899 --> 13:58.154
It's really expensive,
it's like $300.

14:01.378 --> 14:03.059
I don't have all of it right now.

14:04.684 --> 14:07.663
But I can come up with half
if you can come up with the other half.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.201
You talked to your mom, right?

14:13.245 --> 14:14.370
I'm doing this.

14:14.538 --> 14:17.106
You don't have to be involved
or anything,

14:17.274 --> 14:19.356
but I just really need help
with the money.

14:22.315 --> 14:23.116
Yes.

14:24.868 --> 14:26.616
Please, don't tell anyone.
Please.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.282
Just let me know
if you can get the money.

14:49.977 --> 14:51.827
I ran into Glenn yesterday.

14:54.156 --> 14:55.564
Glenn science teacher?

14:55.689 --> 14:57.639
Yeah, he came over to school.

15:02.623 --> 15:03.819
What did he have to say?

15:04.587 --> 15:06.574
He just wanted to share
a little experience

15:06.699 --> 15:08.824
he had over at the karaoke party.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.426
Honey, what did he tell you?

15:11.123 --> 15:12.929
Why don't you tell me
what he told me?

15:13.097 --> 15:16.822
Honey, he was so drunk.
He was so drunk.

15:16.947 --> 15:19.601
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
But I've been wanting to tell you

15:19.726 --> 15:22.338
- but we haven't really had one minute.
- You kissed Glenn?

15:22.669 --> 15:24.240
You didn't hit him, did you?

15:24.408 --> 15:27.109
No, I didn't hit him.
What do you worry about him for?

15:27.234 --> 15:29.837
You just happen to get kissed
by so many people over at school

15:29.962 --> 15:32.448
you just forget to even talk about it,
is that why?

15:32.912 --> 15:35.729
Don't blame the victim.
I'm the victim here, honey.

15:35.854 --> 15:38.633
Do you realize by proxy
I have now kissed Glenn?

15:38.758 --> 15:41.657
- Honey, that's awful. That's awful.
- Yeah!

15:43.453 --> 15:45.303
Honey, did you hear that...

15:46.145 --> 15:48.831
Joe and Katie McCoy
are getting a divorce?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Honey...

16:01.883 --> 16:03.512
I think we need a date.

16:04.118 --> 16:05.818
I got one date with you.

16:06.116 --> 16:08.384
- The post-baby damn date.
- All right.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.264
- Crack open some wine...
- Really?

16:10.389 --> 16:13.256
If we check to make sure
it's got some nice legs,

16:13.381 --> 16:16.095
check to make sure what year it is,
if you want bigger legs.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.815
- Big M!
- Hey, Buddy.

16:17.940 --> 16:18.945
How you doing?

16:19.070 --> 16:21.859
- I'm good, man. How about yourself?
- Good, good.

16:22.108 --> 16:23.625
Well, let's see. I'll have...

16:23.750 --> 16:25.534
You'll have some baby back ribs,

16:25.702 --> 16:28.008
a side of collard and fruitage.
You get 'em every damn time.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.872
- Let the money on the counter.
- And...

16:30.040 --> 16:32.575
Extra BBQ sauce.
I know, I know.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.411
Hey, where are you coming from?
Prom?

16:35.708 --> 16:38.046
No, I went to see Mayor Rodell.

16:38.171 --> 16:41.231
Well, well, well...
Ain't you special?

16:41.356 --> 16:45.154
No, I'm just trying to get the lights
turned back on over at Carrol Park

16:45.322 --> 16:47.525
so we can clean
the park up a little bit.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.225
- Is that right?
- That's right.

16:50.261 --> 16:51.827
You're an idiot, Buddy.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.363
What?

16:54.531 --> 16:55.731
You're an idiot.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.934
That's really funny, big M.
Why are you saying that?

16:58.102 --> 17:00.937
You're an idiot for thinking your Snow
White ass can make a difference.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.173
Do you realize that the other night,
when that little boy got shot,

17:04.402 --> 17:06.190
Coach Taylor was in the park?

17:06.315 --> 17:07.583
Coach Taylor...

17:07.708 --> 17:08.805
Yeah, it figures.

17:08.930 --> 17:12.634
You know, we're trying to organize.
And maybe you could just

17:12.759 --> 17:15.751
help us out a little bit
instead of criticizing.

17:16.205 --> 17:18.356
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

17:19.117 --> 17:20.122
Here's your food.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.799
And I might need
some water, too, please.

17:40.043 --> 17:41.043
Look...

17:44.759 --> 17:47.984
You gonna need somebody who can
talk to these kids. I know a guy.

17:48.492 --> 17:51.487
He's an ex gangster.
He does community work now.

17:56.322 --> 17:58.222
I'll get that water for you.

18:09.741 --> 18:10.841
I should go.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.146
Yeah, I gotta work.

18:15.271 --> 18:17.510
You know,
that's why I gotta go, so...

18:18.027 --> 18:20.451
Well, can I see you later?

18:23.423 --> 18:26.287
I work until closing,
it's a restaurant, and...

18:26.412 --> 18:27.657
What about tomorrow night?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.159
I work every night.

18:31.589 --> 18:35.197
This is, like, the first step
to us breaking up.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.867
- You just pulled me off.
- Yeah. That's what this is.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.982
- The beginning of the end?
- Yeah, I can't lie.

18:42.405 --> 18:44.674
Why don't you come after
closing tomorrow night?

18:45.960 --> 18:46.960
Okay.

18:47.597 --> 18:48.947
Help me clean up?

18:49.771 --> 18:50.880
What does that mean?

18:51.355 --> 18:52.905
Use your imagination.

18:56.519 --> 18:57.819
All right, Jess.

19:00.610 --> 19:01.958
Looks pretty good, yeah?

19:04.461 --> 19:05.439
So...

19:06.753 --> 19:09.498
How long you've been doing this,
like, working for Habitat?

19:09.666 --> 19:11.516
I've been doing it a while.

19:12.224 --> 19:14.581
I did my first one 'cause I thought
it'd be good for my résumé,

19:14.706 --> 19:16.205
and I just kinda got hooked.

19:17.433 --> 19:18.975
I can see how that would happen.

19:20.343 --> 19:23.039
So, I was gonna grab
some food after.

19:23.511 --> 19:25.561
Thought maybe you'd wanna come.

19:31.457 --> 19:34.596
Look, you're really nice...

19:35.361 --> 19:36.559
and really cute,

19:37.738 --> 19:39.016
but I wanna be honest.

19:39.141 --> 19:43.145
I got out of a really long,
very serious relationship, and...

19:45.537 --> 19:47.069
I'm still broken.

19:47.237 --> 19:50.837
You know what? I get it.
I really do. I've been there myself.

19:59.987 --> 20:00.850
But...

20:01.195 --> 20:02.345
What if we...

20:03.809 --> 20:06.222
didn't go to lunch or anything?
What if we...

20:06.390 --> 20:08.624
just were spontaneous
and lived in the moment

20:08.792 --> 20:11.998
and just kissed
and there'd be no strings attached?

20:13.632 --> 20:15.197
Would that be weird?

20:18.824 --> 20:20.202
No, that wouldn't be weird.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.141
That'd be okay.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.535
All right, I'll give you a call.

20:42.660 --> 20:46.495
I thought she would never go down.
She was crying so much.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.432
Look, I got us the wine.
I need it right now.

20:52.069 --> 20:53.603
I need to take a rain check.

20:54.494 --> 20:56.906
Buddy just talked to Virgil,
Virgil knows a fella.

20:57.074 --> 21:00.509
If we could talk to him, he might be
able to help us with this park situation

21:00.677 --> 21:02.389
but it's gotta be tonight.

21:04.465 --> 21:05.565
All right...

21:06.344 --> 21:07.544
You all right?

21:07.950 --> 21:09.685
I mean...
What am I gonna do?

21:10.953 --> 21:11.954
Thank you.

21:12.122 --> 21:13.672
I'll just call Glenn.

21:13.797 --> 21:16.492
If you call Glenn, make sure
he doesn't drink all my scotch.

21:16.660 --> 21:19.745
I'm not making any guarantees
about what Glenn is gonna do or not do.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.812
I'll see you later tonight.

21:23.811 --> 21:24.811
Good luck.

21:28.227 --> 21:29.667
Eric Taylor, Elden Crumpler.

21:29.792 --> 21:31.874
Hey, how are you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

21:32.384 --> 21:33.976
Buddy Garrity. Good to meet you.

21:35.207 --> 21:36.257
Come on in.

21:38.982 --> 21:40.082
Thanks much.

21:40.714 --> 21:41.874
Nice place.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.020
- How long have you been here?
- Since I got out of jail.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.884
What exactly can I do for you?

21:49.964 --> 21:52.795
Well, we're trying
to clean up Carrol Park.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.864
Take it back.

21:55.186 --> 21:56.332
Take it back from who?

21:56.744 --> 21:58.868
We're nice.
We don't wanna take anything back.

21:59.233 --> 22:03.005
We're trying to get the lights turned on
there. I got players who live there.

22:03.173 --> 22:07.043
We're trying to make some space for them
to have somewhere safe to be at night.

22:08.249 --> 22:10.012
I don't wanna offend you, Coach.

22:10.573 --> 22:13.516
I'm sure you're a great football man
like everybody say, but...

22:14.092 --> 22:16.552
there are more problems down there
than just the lights won't work.

22:17.292 --> 22:21.042
So my question to you is:
do you really wanna make a difference,

22:21.483 --> 22:24.226
or are you just feeling sad
because you saw a boy got shot?

22:28.024 --> 22:28.831
Both.

22:32.127 --> 22:33.569
This is what we need.

22:35.016 --> 22:36.672
We need money, for programs.

22:37.684 --> 22:39.942
We need some
of the local businesses like Virgil here

22:40.559 --> 22:43.409
and Buddy here, to send a little
something-something our way.

22:43.534 --> 22:46.549
And not just this week
because there's a boy in a hospital.

22:47.188 --> 22:51.018
As far as the great white hope coming in
from the football field to save the day,

22:51.300 --> 22:55.124
those kids can't see you as an outsider.
They'd smell that a mile away.

22:55.505 --> 22:56.926
It'd do more harm than good.

22:57.189 --> 22:59.295
We need to give them a reason
to believe in this thing,

22:59.714 --> 23:02.925
- whatever this thing is.
- Well, I got an idea.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.234
I think we ought
to have a football game.

23:05.402 --> 23:07.870
- Football game?
- I think we ought to get the Lions

23:08.124 --> 23:09.662
versus the kids at the park,

23:09.787 --> 23:11.440
- and have a little football...
- Wait.

23:11.608 --> 23:13.976
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.
Go ahead.

23:14.785 --> 23:16.142
Good clean fun.

23:16.380 --> 23:19.701
No, no, wait.
Friday night, we got a by.

23:19.887 --> 23:21.887
We could do it saturday night.

23:23.251 --> 23:24.860
What do you think, Elden?

23:25.458 --> 23:27.490
Well, the kids do love the football.

23:28.018 --> 23:29.492
Everyone loves football.

23:35.833 --> 23:38.601
Most important is it's voluntary.
If you wanna be out there, that's great,

23:38.859 --> 23:41.771
if you don't, that's fine, too.
As a matter of fact, if you don't,

23:41.939 --> 23:43.501
I don't want you out there.

23:43.626 --> 23:47.576
But if you do, know there'll be some
rules. We're not gonna have street ball.

23:47.744 --> 23:50.079
We're gonna stick to those rules,
understood?

23:50.247 --> 23:51.814
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

23:51.982 --> 23:54.317
- All right. Good. Tinker!
- Yes, sir!

23:54.485 --> 23:56.452
Break 'em down.
Vince, I wanna talk to you.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.370
Let's go, baby, let's go!

23:58.717 --> 24:01.290
- What's up?
- Listen, I talked to Big Merri.

24:01.458 --> 24:05.093
He's got something over there for you.
Possibly dishwasher or busboy.

24:05.218 --> 24:07.339
- At Ray's Barbeque?
- That's right.

24:08.059 --> 24:09.561
Coach, that wasn't...

24:09.811 --> 24:13.336
- That's not what I was expecting...
- What do you mean? It's a job.

24:13.504 --> 24:16.472
You show up, you work, you get paid.
That's why you want the job, right?

24:17.201 --> 24:19.779
All right. Then show up this afternoon
and see what he's got to say.

24:19.904 --> 24:22.364
Don't let me down,
I stuck my neck out for you.

24:23.678 --> 24:25.348
You be here all the time.

24:25.473 --> 24:28.918
Work hard. No flirting with the girls,
no jaw-jacking with the guys.

24:29.086 --> 24:32.255
Somebody come in and tell you how great
you was on friday night, you thank him,

24:32.423 --> 24:33.756
and you get back to work.

24:34.202 --> 24:36.576
- Yes, sir.
- We'll start you up at a minimum wage.

24:36.701 --> 24:39.462
If things work out, you'll get a raise
in another couple of months.

24:39.630 --> 24:42.131
- That'll work. Thank you.
- It ain't gonna be a lot.

24:42.566 --> 24:45.301
- You ain't gonna get rich here.
- With all due respect, I want a job

24:45.999 --> 24:48.838
that, you know, keep me out of trouble,
plus the food on the table.

24:49.006 --> 24:50.006
That's it.

24:51.076 --> 24:52.126
Last thing:

24:53.053 --> 24:54.610
stay away from my daughter.

24:55.278 --> 24:56.512
She don't want it,

24:57.094 --> 24:58.344
I don't either.

25:00.005 --> 25:02.451
- Understood.
- I ain't gonna remind you of that one.

25:02.966 --> 25:04.664
If I see anything I don't like,

25:04.789 --> 25:06.956
you got to find new employment
elsewhere. Are we clear?

25:07.918 --> 25:09.058
Crystal clear.

25:10.918 --> 25:12.461
Go in the back.
Get you an apron.

25:15.023 --> 25:17.733
- Thank you.
- Go in the back and get you an apron.

25:19.544 --> 25:20.544
Yes, sir.

25:29.193 --> 25:30.243
Hey, honey.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.999
I just wanted to come by
and see how it's going. This is great!

25:35.124 --> 25:36.574
Pretty cool, right?

25:38.312 --> 25:40.686
You look like you know
what you're doing.

25:42.159 --> 25:43.159
Kind of.

25:43.353 --> 25:44.353
Good.

25:44.595 --> 25:46.045
You're having fun?

25:46.170 --> 25:48.097
I am. Actually,
I'm having a real good time.

25:48.617 --> 25:49.617
You are?

25:50.121 --> 25:51.126
I'm so glad.

25:51.251 --> 25:54.313
I'm so glad some smart person
encouraged you to do this.

25:54.438 --> 25:56.884
"So glad some smart person..."

25:58.609 --> 26:01.243
- Who is this, honey?
- Hold on. I'll be back.

26:01.411 --> 26:02.712
I'll watch your saw.

26:04.141 --> 26:07.249
So we need to get the measurements
on this railing, all right?

26:07.417 --> 26:11.220
I'm gonna use it on the pressure treated
wood out back. Can you handle it?

26:12.133 --> 26:15.191
I think I can handle it.
You're such a dork.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.097
No wonder
you're having such a good time.

26:22.239 --> 26:23.289
Who's that?

26:24.996 --> 26:27.303
That's Ryan.
He works for Habitat.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.043
Nice. He seems nice.

26:31.825 --> 26:34.076
Is there something
you wanna tell me about Ryan?

26:42.292 --> 26:43.292
But...

26:44.751 --> 26:47.051
I will say that I feel a lot better.

26:47.669 --> 26:48.824
I'm glad, honey.

26:50.215 --> 26:51.315
I really am.

27:03.278 --> 27:06.589
Make sure you get real good
underneath that one right there.

27:06.986 --> 27:09.946
I can clean up a toilet by myself,
thank you.

27:10.158 --> 27:12.006
I'm just saying
there's no point in paying you

27:12.182 --> 27:16.176
to do a job if I'm gonna have to follow
after everything and clean up after you.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.696
Seems my little brother
has cleaned toilets.

27:18.821 --> 27:20.971
Well, I'm not your little brother.

27:27.367 --> 27:28.855
Yeah, you're not.

27:38.316 --> 27:40.316
I can't believe you hired him.

27:41.713 --> 27:43.763
I'm doing a favor for somebody.

27:44.348 --> 27:46.333
Can't you do me a favor
and tell him to go home?

27:46.458 --> 27:47.849
No, I can't do that.

27:48.228 --> 27:50.163
Working hard, doing a good job.

27:50.288 --> 27:53.322
After all the grief you gave me
about spending time with him?

27:53.490 --> 27:55.358
It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

27:56.170 --> 27:59.528
Besides, I trust you to take care
of yourself and make smart choices.

28:00.450 --> 28:02.550
I appreciate you're trusting me.

28:03.081 --> 28:05.031
I'm gonna scrub that grill.

28:12.577 --> 28:15.536
Look, I'm not even
here on my behalf.

28:16.273 --> 28:17.818
Skeeter's upset.

28:19.721 --> 28:20.814
All day.

28:21.345 --> 28:23.219
All day.
Don't care.

28:23.387 --> 28:25.087
- What?
- There you go.

28:26.527 --> 28:28.524
Just get it out
in the open, all right?

28:29.450 --> 28:30.518
This kiss.

28:31.045 --> 28:34.228
You've been just awkward
and avoiding me, and...

28:34.353 --> 28:36.365
It's just weird
and I don't like it, so...

28:37.374 --> 28:38.661
I apologize.

28:39.322 --> 28:42.071
All right? It won't happen again.
It was a mistake.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.158
Are we cool?

28:49.196 --> 28:50.546
Yeah, we're cool.

28:51.131 --> 28:52.137
Thanks...

28:52.262 --> 28:53.262
so much.

28:56.216 --> 28:58.111
Okay. Somehow,
I don't think we're cool.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.663
Go away!

29:08.829 --> 29:11.836
- What are you doing here?
- I just left my jacket.

29:12.027 --> 29:13.677
Yeah, well, hurry up.

29:28.049 --> 29:29.051
Good night.

29:30.838 --> 29:31.888
Good night.

29:59.895 --> 30:00.969
Hey, Vince.

30:04.975 --> 30:06.225
How's it going?

30:12.520 --> 30:14.830
We got some homework...
to do.

30:18.627 --> 30:20.007
Sorry...

30:46.947 --> 30:50.468
Can I just say something? I don't
wanna get in your business, but...

30:52.547 --> 30:54.870
I just wanna make sure
that you thought through everything.

30:55.152 --> 30:56.511
Look, I'm 16.

30:57.865 --> 31:00.343
I'm 16 and by the time I'm 17,
I'm gonna be a single parent.

31:02.456 --> 31:03.806
Just like my mom.

31:05.593 --> 31:08.684
You know, if this is about the money,
I can figure it out. Just let me know.

31:08.852 --> 31:10.720
It's not the money, all right?
I have some.

31:10.978 --> 31:12.989
- Then what's the problem?
- I'm just...

31:13.157 --> 31:16.039
I'm worried, all right? I haven't been
able to sleep last few nights.

31:16.164 --> 31:19.297
- What are you worried about?
- I'm worried about you, Becky.

31:19.422 --> 31:20.538
And I just...

31:20.663 --> 31:22.513
I mean, I feel responsible.

31:25.561 --> 31:27.169
That's a two-way street.

31:27.337 --> 31:29.387
No, that's not what I'm saying.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.341
You're pregnant, all right?

31:32.509 --> 31:34.309
Whatever you decide to do,

31:34.583 --> 31:36.209
that's a huge decision.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.881
A decision you'll have
to live with the rest of your life.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.997
And I'm gonna have to live with.

31:42.075 --> 31:44.378
And it's not like
I wanna be a dad, all right?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.503
But there's something about...

31:47.252 --> 31:49.625
not being one, you know?

31:49.793 --> 31:51.243
You not being a mom

31:51.814 --> 31:53.724
just because we decide
to make the baby go away,

31:53.849 --> 31:56.933
and that just makes me
really, really uncomfortable.

31:58.172 --> 31:59.631
You know what I mean?

32:05.519 --> 32:07.369
Will you just take me home?

32:17.356 --> 32:20.960
Yo, man, I'm so hungry right now
I might be able to eat a whole damn pig.

32:21.085 --> 32:22.235
That's right!

32:22.638 --> 32:24.226
Yeah, man.
Don't ask, don't tell.

32:24.729 --> 32:26.684
You already know what it is.

32:27.317 --> 32:28.230
What's up?

32:29.530 --> 32:31.971
- I see you in a minute.
- They got you sweeping there?

32:32.096 --> 32:33.803
- It's the job.
- If you need some money,

32:33.971 --> 32:37.041
- holla to your boy Calvin, man.
- What's up? You need something?

32:37.166 --> 32:39.342
We was thinking you was gonna
bring us something to eat.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.407
How about some of them ribs?
Some of them collard greens, yo.

32:42.532 --> 32:44.780
Go to the counter order to Big Merr.
He'll take care of you.

32:45.273 --> 32:47.183
Come on, dog.
Just bring in some damn food, man.

32:48.262 --> 32:50.119
You're hungry?
You wanna eat?

32:50.771 --> 32:52.221
Like I said before,

32:52.423 --> 32:54.991
you gotta go inside like everybody else,
and order at the counter.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.127
- You can't even hook up your boys?
- What kind of crap job is this?

32:58.295 --> 33:00.162
Who's this dude?
You better chill out...

33:00.330 --> 33:02.214
You tell me to chill out?!

33:06.056 --> 33:07.256
That's enough.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.154
We're closing up.

33:09.684 --> 33:11.134
That means goodbye.

33:12.473 --> 33:13.565
You heard the man.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.140
They're closing up.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.567
No trouble, man.
Let's roll out.

33:19.281 --> 33:20.449
Let's roll.

33:38.428 --> 33:40.336
Look, I know this job ain't fun.

33:41.041 --> 33:43.741
But it pays,
and it keeps you out of joint.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.771
You're better than them.

33:56.003 --> 33:57.103
No, I'm not.

33:59.421 --> 34:01.023
You're here, ain't you?

34:07.459 --> 34:08.708
Let's close up,

34:09.275 --> 34:10.766
and get on over to the park.

34:12.723 --> 34:13.723
Yes, sir.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.766
Eric, what's...
Eric, what's the deal with the lights?

34:43.934 --> 34:45.935
Honey, you know the lights
aren't coming on, right?

34:46.103 --> 34:47.770
Honey, I know the lights aren't on.

34:47.938 --> 34:50.639
That's why I'm on the phone with
the city guy trying to get some answers.

34:50.808 --> 34:53.042
- Trying to get the lights turned on.
- Can I do something?

34:53.356 --> 34:54.877
No, there's nothing you can do.

34:55.045 --> 34:57.045
Eric, we need to speak...
We might have a problem.

34:57.214 --> 34:59.315
What?
That's the other team.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.667
Right.

35:09.027 --> 35:10.092
Hi, y'all.

35:10.260 --> 35:11.427
Have a good game.

35:11.595 --> 35:13.563
- Thanks for coming.
- Good game.

35:13.731 --> 35:14.831
How are you?

35:15.662 --> 35:16.666
Good game.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.003
Hey Elden.

35:21.310 --> 35:24.110
- Can I talk to you? Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:25.109 --> 35:27.310
- What's up?
- We got a problem with these lights.

35:27.718 --> 35:29.768
Well, you gotta get into
the switch box over there.

35:29.893 --> 35:32.983
Would you have any knowledge of
how we might get past the padlock

35:33.108 --> 35:34.517
that's on the switch box?

35:48.613 --> 35:49.832
What are you laughing at?

35:50.115 --> 35:51.520
That was funny.

35:54.329 --> 35:55.829
You guys be careful.

35:58.005 --> 35:59.008
Here it is.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.282
- How's it going, ya'll? How you doing?
- What's going on?

36:07.063 --> 36:08.164
Hey, Vince.

36:11.382 --> 36:15.524
I'm not sure if there's something that
you feel like you need to say or do,

36:16.029 --> 36:18.830
and I realize that you and Jess
have some sort of history, but...

36:18.955 --> 36:20.997
I really do like her a lot
so if you...

36:21.283 --> 36:24.286
wanna hit me or
whatever it is that you need to do,

36:24.411 --> 36:27.036
I'd really like to get
past that at some point,

36:27.204 --> 36:29.739
'cause this is kind of getting
a little silly.

36:36.079 --> 36:37.129
Your honor.

36:51.207 --> 36:52.707
What does that mean?

36:58.802 --> 37:01.270
Alright,
I want this to be a clean game.

37:02.010 --> 37:03.339
I don't wanna see any crap.

37:03.717 --> 37:06.008
If I see any crap,
I'm gonna call it.

37:07.996 --> 37:09.995
- Ya'll got it?
- You got it, sir.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.081
- Y'all got that?
- Yes, sir.

37:14.488 --> 37:15.567
All right.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.192
- Call it.
- Heads.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.257
- Heads it is...
- Let's go!

37:21.425 --> 37:24.293
Alright, we got the lights on.
Let's have some fun! Let's go!

37:26.966 --> 37:28.366
Go get 'em, Lions.

37:40.395 --> 37:42.645
Man, it's little Vince,
it's little Vince, baby.

37:42.813 --> 37:45.615
- Ain't you on the wrong side, homey?
- You'll see. Come on, man.

37:45.783 --> 37:46.783
Ready.

37:55.484 --> 37:57.827
I told you you was
on the wrong side.

37:57.995 --> 38:00.062
- Next time, I'll just snap you two.
- Just try.

38:00.230 --> 38:02.980
- Should I say something to my guys?
- No...

38:03.405 --> 38:04.520
It'll be alright.

38:05.736 --> 38:06.986
All right.

38:07.838 --> 38:09.672
Listen.
I know these dudes, all right?

38:09.840 --> 38:12.008
To beat them, we can't give up,
and we can't back down.

38:12.444 --> 38:14.343
Let's have some fun.
Put it at work, all right?

38:14.640 --> 38:17.280
- On 3. 38 Jet. 1, 2, 3...
- Break!

38:26.743 --> 38:28.791
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

39:22.579 --> 39:25.247
- What's that kid's name?
- It's Maurice.

39:27.411 --> 39:28.411
Come here!

39:30.535 --> 39:32.185
- How old are you?
- 13.

39:32.310 --> 39:34.157
- What school do you go to?
- Kilroy Middle.

39:34.282 --> 39:35.691
- You like football?
- Yes.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.060
Next year, you wanna play
football with me?

39:38.228 --> 39:41.197
- Of course.
- You come find me next year? Promise?

39:41.439 --> 39:43.065
Don't make me come
looking after you.

39:43.233 --> 39:44.724
- No, sir.
- All right. Do that.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.395
- Thanks, Coach.
- All right.

39:48.460 --> 39:51.507
- You make sure he comes see me?
- Yeah, you got it.

39:51.675 --> 39:52.675
All right.

40:08.253 --> 40:10.927
You know that it's not lost
on me that I owe you a date.

40:11.439 --> 40:13.176
It's not lost on me either, honey.

40:13.301 --> 40:15.015
While we may not be the McCoy's,

40:15.140 --> 40:18.734
I also realize that our relationship
needs nurturing.

40:22.010 --> 40:23.873
- What are you laughing at?
- It's funny.

40:24.711 --> 40:25.738
Nurturing.

40:25.863 --> 40:27.977
I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm being serious.

40:28.145 --> 40:30.168
Oh, honey,
I love you to pieces for that.

40:30.647 --> 40:32.748
- Honey, go left. Go left.
- What?

40:33.009 --> 40:34.009
Why?

40:34.134 --> 40:36.485
- Where are we going now?
- Honey, you'll see.

40:37.562 --> 40:38.562
Oh, man...

40:40.624 --> 40:42.046
That's gorgeous.

40:45.415 --> 40:46.565
So beautiful.

40:47.247 --> 40:49.462
Does that ring
any bells for you, hon?

40:53.674 --> 40:56.327
Remember...
Okay, not our first date,

40:56.928 --> 40:58.307
but our first date.

40:58.475 --> 41:01.177
That'd be our first date,
or first date?

41:01.345 --> 41:02.395
First date.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.342
- I think I remember.
- Do you?

41:04.467 --> 41:07.334
You think you remember?
I wanna remind you of that.

41:08.096 --> 41:10.046
I mean, it's been a long time.

41:10.921 --> 41:13.871
And you're old.
You're really old and grouchy.

41:18.489 --> 41:19.789
Damn I love you.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.283
Damn I love you too, babe...

41:43.027 --> 41:45.855
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, you wanna come in, or...

41:46.444 --> 41:48.852
- Can you get out here?
- Yeah, absolutely.

41:50.325 --> 41:51.327
What's up?

41:51.799 --> 41:53.749
Just a couple things, really.

41:54.809 --> 41:56.132
First, it really...

41:57.431 --> 42:00.569
It really hurt me that you said
that kissing me was a mistake.

42:01.513 --> 42:05.194
Because I didn't think it was a mistake,
and that meant something to me.

42:07.253 --> 42:08.303
How come...

42:09.789 --> 42:11.213
I don't mean to hurt you, ever.

42:11.673 --> 42:12.673
It just...

42:16.111 --> 42:19.626
Since the kiss, it's been different.
You've been avoiding me, and...

42:19.751 --> 42:21.324
to be honest, you seem lost.

42:22.316 --> 42:23.316
So...

42:23.904 --> 42:26.245
I didn't know what else to say,
you know?

42:26.370 --> 42:27.370
I felt...

42:27.856 --> 42:29.865
I just don't want to ruin
what we had before.

42:30.451 --> 42:31.451
That's it.

42:31.826 --> 42:33.169
Tim, I'm pregnant.

42:34.706 --> 42:35.706
What?

42:39.505 --> 42:40.655
I'm pregnant.

42:43.461 --> 42:45.748
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

42:46.171 --> 42:47.216
And I am...

42:49.000 --> 42:50.586
so scared...

42:51.656 --> 42:52.656
Come here.

42:55.921 --> 42:57.360
You're gonna be fine.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.613
- I don't know...
- It's gonna be fine.
