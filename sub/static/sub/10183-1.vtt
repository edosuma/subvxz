<i>There is one graduate here today</i>

00:42.083 --> 00:47.919
<i>that has won every single honor
and award this school gives out.</i>

00:47.955 --> 00:54.587
<i>That graduate,
our friend, is Van Wilder!</i>

01:13.914 --> 01:18.351
<i>Standing here today,
I cannot help but wish I could stay</i>

01:18.352 --> 01:20.843
<i>in high school forever.</i>

01:20.855 --> 01:24.586
<i>I mean, there are
so many warm mammories...</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:29.486
<i>Memories I have of this place.</i>

01:30.631 --> 01:34.157
<i>But, you see, change, like life,</i>

01:34.602 --> 01:37.866
<i>has a way of sneaking up on us.</i>

01:43.978 --> 01:47.743
<i>When we least expect it, yeah.</i>

01:49.950 --> 01:55.444
<i>Sure, the timing may seem
very, very bad,</i>

01:57.591 --> 02:02.824
<i>but yet it feels good, so good,</i>

02:03.831 --> 02:06.800
<i>to be graduating
with some of the sharpest minds</i>

02:06.801 --> 02:12.568
<i>and swiftly darting tongues
that this school has to offer.</i>

02:13.340 --> 02:18.140
<i>Listen to me ramble.
I am really giving you a mouthful.</i>

02:18.212 --> 02:22.048
<i>But before I'm finished,
it is my extreme pleasure</i>

02:22.049 --> 02:28.188
<i>to recognize someone who has aced
her oral exams,</i>

02:28.189 --> 02:32.325
<i>who has always been head of the class,</i>

02:32.326 --> 02:38.492
<i>graduating summa cum</i>

02:44.405 --> 02:49.638
<i>laude. Our very own valedictorian.</i>

03:01.188 --> 03:03.747
<i>Congratulations, graduates!</i>

03:10.164 --> 03:12.599
- Congratulations, Son.
- Thanks.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.068
Now, let's get out of here.
The sooner we get to Amsterdam,

03:15.069 --> 03:17.670
the sooner we won't be able
to remember it.

03:17.671 --> 03:19.229
Yeah.

03:22.309 --> 03:25.278
- You're not going to Amsterdam.
- I can't.

03:25.279 --> 03:28.214
Sheik Mohammad is building
an island outside of Dubai.

03:28.215 --> 03:31.251
And I'm gonna help him
import a million tons of sand.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.553
It's a huge opportunity, Van.

03:33.554 --> 03:36.356
Come on. You're gonna have
a great time without me.

03:36.357 --> 03:38.691
Exploring nether regions
in the Netherlands

03:38.692 --> 03:42.128
is not a bad way to spend
your summer before college.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.898
I still don't know why I can't
just skip college and come work for you.

03:44.899 --> 03:46.699
I mean, I know the business,
we could hang out...

03:46.700 --> 03:50.470
Van, every Wilder man
has graduated from Coolidge.

03:50.471 --> 03:55.203
It's tradition. And tradition
is something you just don't break.

03:55.910 --> 03:57.677
I gotta run. Hey, have a great time,

03:57.678 --> 03:59.546
do everything I wouldn't do,
and remember,

03:59.547 --> 04:03.107
- "Banging, broke or blitzed"...
- "A Wilder never quits".

04:03.784 --> 04:05.842
Write that down.

06:06.073 --> 06:09.770
Well, well. Look who just arrived.

06:20.821 --> 06:23.690
Van, do you have
to go back to the college?

06:23.691 --> 06:26.557
Come back to Amsterdam with us.

06:26.894 --> 06:32.832
Dulia, Babette, I'm sorry, ladies,
but I must.

06:43.677 --> 06:46.771
I've been waiting 30 years for this.

07:05.999 --> 07:09.491
It's a little small, but I can work with it.

07:20.714 --> 07:23.978
Van Wilder. I'm your new roommate.

07:25.753 --> 07:28.380
All right. Farley.

07:30.991 --> 07:32.685
Smoke?

07:34.795 --> 07:37.363
Man, am I glad
we are roommates, man!

07:37.364 --> 07:40.264
This place is a pimper's paradise.

07:41.902 --> 07:45.200
I'm gonna make
some of my special brownies.

08:08.462 --> 08:11.998
My God!
We've been invaded by Supercuts!

08:11.999 --> 08:16.595
- Lieutenant Dirk Arnold, ROTC.
- Corporal Benedict, ROTC.

08:17.070 --> 08:20.173
Van Wilder, WTF?

08:20.174 --> 08:24.210
The Honorable Dean Charles Reardon
requests your presence immediately.

08:24.211 --> 08:26.906
But I just put my slippers on.

08:31.518 --> 08:33.385
Van Wilder, sir, as you ordered.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.683
Return to your squad.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.123
Well, well, Mr. Wilder.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.559
Nice of you to join us.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.196
Colonel Charles Reardon,
Dean, Coolidge College.

08:43.197 --> 08:45.031
How's it hanging, Chuck?

08:45.032 --> 08:47.166
You see these fine young men, Wilder?

08:47.167 --> 08:48.935
These are Reardon's Raiders.

08:48.936 --> 08:51.871
They've won every ROTC war game
for the past three years.

08:51.872 --> 08:54.340
They're my pride and joy.

08:55.676 --> 09:00.203
Good doggies.
I especially like your Chihuahua.

09:01.648 --> 09:05.485
Lady Liberty is a purebred
Italian greyhound.

09:05.486 --> 09:08.716
Actually, I was talking about that guy.

09:09.223 --> 09:10.951
Arnold!

09:11.458 --> 09:13.687
Secure Lady Liberty.

09:14.027 --> 09:17.291
Let's you and me take a little ride, son.

09:20.133 --> 09:21.691
Stay.

09:23.003 --> 09:26.063
<i>- Good dog.
- Get the lead out, Wilder!</i>

09:28.675 --> 09:30.877
You know, I went to school here
with your father.

09:30.878 --> 09:31.978
He acted like he owned the place,

09:31.979 --> 09:35.414
just 'cause his family's name
was on that building over there.

09:35.415 --> 09:37.283
You know what that name
means to me?

09:37.284 --> 09:40.820
About as much as titties on a mule, son.
I run this outfit now.

09:40.821 --> 09:44.123
And while you're here,
you'll follow Reardon's Rules.

09:44.124 --> 09:48.116
No drinking, no fornicating,
and no partying, period.

09:48.829 --> 09:52.498
Or you'll be the first Wilder
who fails to graduate from Coolidge.

09:52.499 --> 09:54.333
Now, do you follow me?

09:54.334 --> 09:57.701
Yes, sir! You prefer your mules titless!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.474
Let's get one thing straight, son.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.977
I may not be able to kick you out of here
'cause of your daddy and his dough.

10:04.978 --> 10:09.437
But you screw with me,
and I'll make it so you'll pray to leave.

10:09.449 --> 10:11.211
Out.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.453
I'm glad we had this talk.

10:14.454 --> 10:18.014
Means there won't be
any problems in the future.

10:19.293 --> 10:24.628
Party tonight, party tonight.
Party tonight, party tonight, thank you.

10:25.232 --> 10:29.101
You smell that, Farley?
That's the smell of opportunity.

10:29.102 --> 10:33.172
The smell of thousands of new girls.
The... Hello.

10:33.173 --> 10:36.742
Van Wilder, Chairman
of Freshman Relations, self-appointed.

10:36.743 --> 10:38.477
This is my partner, Farley Marley.

10:38.478 --> 10:42.880
- Jah Rastafari.
- He's from Jamaica.

10:42.983 --> 10:44.250
- Right.
- We're having a little

10:44.251 --> 10:47.286
room-warming soiree tonight.
Nothing big, just a few hundred friends,

10:47.287 --> 10:50.856
foam machine, nitrous, frappuccinos.
We would love it if you ladies came.

10:50.857 --> 10:53.689
- A party?
- You're joking, right?

10:59.533 --> 11:03.469
No!

11:04.438 --> 11:06.269
It's okay.

11:10.010 --> 11:13.070
Wow. This is embarrassing.

11:13.614 --> 11:16.514
I can't believe nobody showed up.

11:17.451 --> 11:20.044
Well, it's about time.

11:24.091 --> 11:25.751
Party?

11:30.564 --> 11:35.234
So, Yu Dum Fok! You came all the way
here from China.

11:35.235 --> 11:39.138
Yes. Village I grow up in boring as shit.

11:39.139 --> 11:46.010
No party. I dream of beer bong,
bimbos, and boob on my butt.

11:46.013 --> 11:49.615
So, I work in sweatshop,
save money, come here.

11:49.616 --> 11:53.853
Cannot even afford room,
have to sleep in janitor closet.

11:53.854 --> 11:58.024
That's one of the most beautiful things
I've ever heard, Yu Dum Fok.

11:58.025 --> 12:03.295
No offense to your ancestors,
but maybe we'll just call you Yu, Yu.

12:03.296 --> 12:06.999
Van, how come no hot,
young, American cat?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.025
Coolidge is number one party school!

12:10.237 --> 12:14.036
1979. Wow!

12:15.075 --> 12:17.600
Girls used to have hair?

12:20.047 --> 12:23.315
I hate to break it to you, Yu,

12:23.316 --> 12:26.580
but I don't think
that's the case anymore.

12:26.953 --> 12:28.943
No party?

12:29.690 --> 12:31.623
No beer bong?

12:32.526 --> 12:35.586
- No boob on butt?
- No.

12:36.296 --> 12:39.663
I go to janitor closet now.
Drink "breach".

12:42.102 --> 12:43.660
Forget the "breach".

12:47.274 --> 12:50.709
Boys, it's toga time.

13:18.171 --> 13:22.869
Friends, Romans, grunting women,
lend me your beers.

13:51.204 --> 13:52.898
Welcome.

13:54.341 --> 13:55.574
Nice jugs.

13:55.575 --> 13:58.444
They contain the sacred blood
of the lamb.

13:58.445 --> 14:00.613
Do you wish to be purified?

14:00.614 --> 14:03.548
We here for boob on butt.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.912
Actually, I think we're lost.

14:07.788 --> 14:12.657
Come with me. My sisters
will take care of your friends.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.462
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but in the past few years

14:16.463 --> 14:20.866
Coolidge has become a more
religious and conservative campus

14:20.867 --> 14:23.130
than it used to be.

14:24.204 --> 14:26.438
I'd better take these.

14:26.439 --> 14:29.241
Alcohol is the devil's mouthwash.

14:29.242 --> 14:31.377
At Coolidge, we're dry.

14:31.378 --> 14:34.046
You know, science has made
incredible advancements

14:34.047 --> 14:36.048
in personal lubrication.

14:36.049 --> 14:39.040
You won't be needing these, either.

14:39.286 --> 14:43.882
Orgasms are the devil's heroin.
Just once, and you're hooked.

14:45.826 --> 14:51.864
"O daughters of Jerusalem,
do not awaken love until it is ready".

14:51.865 --> 14:53.732
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:53.733 --> 14:56.167
Song of Solomon, 8:4.

14:57.604 --> 15:02.598
Let she who is without sin
grasp the first bone.

15:04.911 --> 15:07.436
Wilder, 69.

15:09.249 --> 15:13.152
Perhaps you and your friends
should look into a different school.

15:13.153 --> 15:15.087
We have enough sinners here.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.690
You wouldn't happen to have
their phone numbers, would you?

15:17.691 --> 15:20.421
You have a very impure spirit.

15:20.527 --> 15:26.090
There's a dark, wretched hole
waiting for you.

15:26.533 --> 15:30.264
Okay, but you have to buy me
a drink first.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.131
I think that can be arranged.

15:33.673 --> 15:36.698
Now I know what a tampon feels like.

15:37.410 --> 15:39.879
This is a complete fuckery,
you know, man.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.648
No poom poom, no ganja.

15:42.649 --> 15:46.352
Vampires for Jesus,
throwing blood on us?

15:46.353 --> 15:50.489
- I can't take four years of this bullshit.
- We drink "breach," get sent home.

15:50.490 --> 15:55.689
Hey! No one's drinking "breach!"
And no one's going home.

15:56.062 --> 15:58.723
So what did you have in mind?

16:05.772 --> 16:07.500
We shake things up a bit.

16:18.952 --> 16:21.511
Why don't we just buy some?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.456
Where's the fun in that?

16:25.358 --> 16:28.656
This almost as good as boob on butt.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.923
Say hello to my little friend.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.240
Sorry.

17:57.017 --> 17:58.609
Don't forget to floss.

18:03.289 --> 18:06.692
Hi, Dirk. How's that big gun of yours?

18:06.693 --> 18:09.962
- Hey, honeybear.
- Hey, honeybear!

18:09.963 --> 18:15.560
Kaitlin. So nice you could make it.
We missed you in Bible study again.

18:15.802 --> 18:17.963
- Hymnal?
- Whoa!

18:18.905 --> 18:21.703
Nice arm, Jezebel.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.010
- I believe this is yours.
- Thanks.

18:25.011 --> 18:28.537
Van Wilder, hopeless romantic.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.410
- Kaitlin Hayes.
- My girlfriend.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.254
Well, it's nice to see there are
some Christians

18:35.255 --> 18:37.814
who still do charity work.

18:38.725 --> 18:41.284
Come on, Kaitlin, let's go.

18:42.595 --> 18:45.859
Yeah, before all the good seats
are taken!

18:45.965 --> 18:48.933
No, thanks. I brought my own.

18:51.404 --> 18:52.604
Thank you.

18:52.605 --> 18:56.809
Today, I wanna talk about
something that's all over this school,

18:56.810 --> 19:02.347
and it isn't pencils, no.
And it isn't books. But it's sin.

19:02.348 --> 19:05.373
S- I-N. Sin.

19:05.418 --> 19:10.089
You know, it seems like they'll let just
about anybody in school these days.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.057
Except Jesus.

19:12.058 --> 19:15.394
And, you know, I took the time
to check Jesus' transcripts,

19:15.395 --> 19:19.631
and I find out that Jesus has
a perfect GPA.

19:19.632 --> 19:22.828
Yeah, that stands
for God Point Average.

19:24.637 --> 19:27.172
Amen, amen.

19:27.173 --> 19:29.675
- Amen.
- Amen.

19:29.676 --> 19:34.078
But what is the number one sin
on campus today?

19:35.215 --> 19:37.649
Quite plainly, it's sex.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.885
- Sex.
- S-E-X.

19:39.886 --> 19:41.785
- Sex.
- Sex.

19:41.855 --> 19:46.258
Even as we're speaking,
the sinning is beginning. Amen!

19:46.259 --> 19:48.093
- Amen.
- Amen.

19:48.094 --> 19:49.228
Amen, sisters.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.130
- Gentlemen, the Lord is...
- Hallelujah, sister!

19:51.131 --> 19:52.498
- ... about to work in very...
- Hallelujah!

19:52.499 --> 19:53.832
- ... mysterious ways.
- Hallelujah!

19:53.833 --> 19:58.201
That's right, sisters.
I want you to feel the Lord inside you.

19:59.005 --> 20:05.110
Because fornication, copulation
and the king of all sins, masturbation,

20:05.111 --> 20:09.214
is happening all around us,
even at this very moment.

20:09.215 --> 20:11.876
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:12.051 --> 20:17.921
But we've got a secret because
we've got Jesus on our side.

20:18.992 --> 20:20.325
Can I get an amen?

20:20.326 --> 20:21.793
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:21.794 --> 20:25.097
Amen, sisters!
Yes, they're feeling it right now!

20:25.098 --> 20:28.534
They got the power of the Lord
deep down inside them.

20:28.535 --> 20:30.400
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:30.603 --> 20:32.838
Hallelujah, sister, hallelujah.

20:32.839 --> 20:35.273
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

20:36.109 --> 20:38.443
- I want each of you out there to pray.
- Amen.

20:38.444 --> 20:41.413
Pray that you might be
feeling what they're feeling.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.681
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:42.682 --> 20:45.150
Yes, they're talking to the big guy.

20:45.151 --> 20:46.752
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:46.753 --> 20:49.321
Oh, the sisters are feeling
mighty good right now.

20:49.322 --> 20:51.790
- Amen, sisters!
- Amen!

20:51.791 --> 20:54.691
It's time for some tits and mass.

20:56.829 --> 20:59.398
- Amen!
- Amen!

20:59.399 --> 21:01.200
- Amen!
- Amen!

21:01.201 --> 21:02.568
Amen, sisters!

21:02.569 --> 21:04.236
That's what I'm talking about!

21:04.237 --> 21:05.971
- Amen!
- Amen!

21:05.972 --> 21:08.941
You might as well open up
your pearly gates, dear Lord.

21:08.942 --> 21:12.411
'Cause these sisters are coming!
These sisters are coming!

21:12.412 --> 21:14.446
These sisters are coming!

21:14.447 --> 21:16.346
- Amen!
- Amen!

21:17.750 --> 21:18.746
You know what these are?

21:18.747 --> 21:20.175
You know what these are?

21:21.354 --> 21:23.185
Yes, sir.

21:23.923 --> 21:27.459
And I think experimentation
is healthy for any marriage.

21:27.460 --> 21:32.192
You listen to me, funny man.
I can't prove it, but I know it was you.

21:32.465 --> 21:36.134
And you can rest assured,
I will get to the bottom of this.

21:36.135 --> 21:39.934
In this case, Chuck,
may I recommend some Vaseline.

21:42.542 --> 21:47.945
You know, nowadays,
the Dean has much more influence

21:48.147 --> 21:50.616
over a student's curriculum.

21:50.617 --> 21:54.314
And I have got something special
in store for you.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.947
Something to build character.
Something to make you a man.

21:59.325 --> 22:03.729
- Left, left, left, left, left, left...
- Left, left, left, left, left, left...

22:03.730 --> 22:05.497
I'm gonna take a stab in the dark
and say

22:05.498 --> 22:08.865
that none of you signed up
for this, either.

22:12.105 --> 22:15.073
Well, if they think
that we came to college

22:15.074 --> 22:17.976
to waste our time playing soldier

22:17.977 --> 22:23.181
to some slack-jawed, pituitary-pumping,
testosterone-tweaking Neanderthal,

22:23.182 --> 22:25.343
then they...

22:28.254 --> 22:30.822
Are 100% correct.

22:30.823 --> 22:34.156
Attention! Straight line! Eyes forward!

22:35.328 --> 22:38.897
I'm Corporal Hayes.
I will be your drill instructor.

22:38.898 --> 22:42.701
It's my job to guide you
through your ROTC physical training,

22:42.702 --> 22:46.467
which is required to graduate
from this institution.

22:46.506 --> 22:48.940
Are there any questions?

22:49.876 --> 22:51.176
Yes, soldier.

22:51.177 --> 22:55.113
Do you, by chance, drill in private?

22:55.715 --> 22:57.182
Well, Mr. Wilder, if you'd like,

22:57.183 --> 23:02.120
I'm sure I can arrange for us to spend
a little one-on-one time together.

23:02.822 --> 23:05.517
This a new experience for you?

23:06.492 --> 23:08.050
Yeah.

23:08.428 --> 23:12.591
I usually go electric.
Helps get those hard-to-reach spots.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.367
Hilarious. I've met guys like you before.

23:17.403 --> 23:20.701
The only person you care about
is yourself.

23:21.607 --> 23:23.972
- Something funny?
- Yeah.

23:24.510 --> 23:27.546
I just can't wait to prove you wrong.

23:27.547 --> 23:29.014
We'll see.

23:29.015 --> 23:32.143
Oh, and by the way, you missed a spot.

23:32.819 --> 23:34.547
Enjoy.

23:43.996 --> 23:47.294
I'm sorry. I ordered mine well-done.

23:50.770 --> 23:52.804
I have better food in sweatshop.

23:52.805 --> 23:55.500
Oh, it can't be that bad, Yu.

24:06.619 --> 24:12.079
- What? I had the munchies.
- Well, look what we have here.

24:12.992 --> 24:14.326
I haven't seen this many turds

24:14.327 --> 24:17.887
since I won
that campus hot-dog eating contest.

24:18.231 --> 24:23.201
Yeah, I haven't seen this many pansies
since I was picking flowers yesterday.

24:23.202 --> 24:26.238
Remember, I was making
that arrangement, and the...

24:26.239 --> 24:28.440
So how's the chow, ladies?

24:28.441 --> 24:32.010
I give the presentation three stars,
I really do,

24:32.011 --> 24:35.173
but the pseudo meat, it's a little dry.

24:50.763 --> 24:54.255
- There you go. All better.
- Yum, yum, yum.

24:57.804 --> 24:59.971
You know, I heard they were looking
for a few good men,

24:59.972 --> 25:03.532
but I guess they'll take
whatever they can get.

25:05.745 --> 25:10.375
- Hey, Dirk.
- Kaitlin! Hey, honeybear, hi!

25:11.117 --> 25:12.284
What are you boys up to?

25:12.285 --> 25:15.587
Well, we were just congratulating
these fine young soldiers here

25:15.588 --> 25:19.854
on their first day of duty.
You know me, Lieutenant Friendly.

25:20.026 --> 25:23.595
Lieutenant Friendly here even
volunteered to switch meals with me.

25:23.596 --> 25:25.859
Oh, what a nice guy.

25:33.773 --> 25:37.208
Yum, yum. That is so good.

25:38.611 --> 25:40.738
How's yours, Dirk?

25:47.320 --> 25:49.048
Oh, God.

25:59.098 --> 26:01.190
Well, how was it?

26:05.471 --> 26:07.962
Always leading by example.

26:09.242 --> 26:12.978
- So, are we still going to the game?
- Oh, I...

26:12.979 --> 26:15.003
You bet we are!

26:15.481 --> 26:16.715
What game?

26:16.716 --> 26:19.451
- There's a football game this weekend.
- Really?

26:19.452 --> 26:21.686
These losers haven't won
a game in years.

26:21.687 --> 26:22.921
Come on, it's not about winning
or losing.

26:22.922 --> 26:25.223
It's about supporting your school.

26:25.224 --> 26:28.226
You know what? You are so right, babe.
School spirit.

26:28.227 --> 26:29.594
Okay, well I'm gonna get back to class.

26:29.595 --> 26:31.619
Okay. Bye.

26:32.798 --> 26:37.394
All right, guess what, queerbait?
You're officially on my bad side.

26:48.781 --> 26:53.650
The team's a joke, but the concessions
will probably buy me a new Humvee.

26:56.822 --> 26:58.056
Right.

26:58.057 --> 27:01.822
I take bigger hits than these guys
for breakfast.

27:02.028 --> 27:03.728
No, it's not the team's fault.

27:03.729 --> 27:07.357
- You guys, come on!
- They've got no inspiration.

27:07.533 --> 27:10.502
<i>It looks like the cheerleaders are
asking for a little divine intervention.</i>

27:10.503 --> 27:12.698
I'll be right back.

27:13.406 --> 27:15.669
Where you going, man?

27:16.008 --> 27:17.873
To fix this.

27:22.381 --> 27:26.373
I have never seen
such a sorry display in all my life.

27:26.452 --> 27:28.887
I mean, where's the fire?
Where is the intensity?

27:28.888 --> 27:33.222
And for God's sake,
where are the tight ends?

27:33.593 --> 27:35.627
Your team needs you out there.

27:35.628 --> 27:40.131
Okay, being a cheerleader isn't
about pigtails and pompoms.

27:40.132 --> 27:43.735
It's about standing by your team,
even when they suck.

27:43.736 --> 27:47.105
Especially when they suck.

27:47.106 --> 27:48.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:48.207 --> 27:49.641
Now, do you think you can do that?

27:49.642 --> 27:50.809
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:50.810 --> 27:53.545
Do you think you can give it
the old college try?

27:53.546 --> 27:54.679
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:54.680 --> 27:59.317
Do you think maybe, just maybe,
you can help those guys score?

27:59.318 --> 28:00.719
- Yes!
- Yes!

28:00.720 --> 28:03.415
That's what I'm talking about.

28:03.756 --> 28:08.352
But first, we're gonna have
to make a few cuts.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.604
Who knew our cheerleaders were hot?

28:19.605 --> 28:22.596
Who knew our cheerleaders
were women?

28:23.442 --> 28:26.678
Hey, guys.
The girls have done their part.

28:26.679 --> 28:28.942
Now it's your turn.

28:30.616 --> 28:33.618
Oh, and they said
that if you win this thing,

28:33.619 --> 28:36.713
they're throwing you a victory party.

28:37.356 --> 28:41.526
Victory party, guys. All right, let's go.
One, two, three...

28:41.527 --> 28:43.756
- Coolidge!
- Coolidge!

28:45.464 --> 28:48.660
Come on! I know you can do it, now.

28:49.101 --> 28:50.802
<i>I tell you,
I don't know whose idea it was,</i>

28:50.803 --> 28:55.637
<i>but these cheerleaders are grinding it
harder than Juan Valdez.</i>

28:56.909 --> 28:58.774
What the...

28:59.879 --> 29:01.778
Sweet Jesus!

29:28.574 --> 29:31.542
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

30:44.083 --> 30:46.210
Watch your head!

30:53.859 --> 30:56.122
Guys, give me a ride.

31:13.145 --> 31:14.669
Hey!

31:15.181 --> 31:17.808
- School spirit?
- No, thanks.

31:17.950 --> 31:20.042
How about a beer?

31:24.623 --> 31:26.522
In a bottle.

31:30.129 --> 31:32.358
I shouldn't be here.

31:49.281 --> 31:51.248
Hey, wait up!

31:53.252 --> 31:54.686
I'll walk you back to your dorm.

31:54.687 --> 31:58.256
I'm sorry. I just... I can't afford to do
anything that might jeopardize

31:58.257 --> 32:02.215
- getting into officer-training school.
- Understandable.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.096
I must seem
like such a Goody Two-shoes.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.655
No.

32:06.832 --> 32:09.197
I was gonna say prude.

32:16.542 --> 32:21.172
<i>You know, you should read
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.</i>

32:22.381 --> 32:26.749
He say, "All great warfare
is based on deception.

32:27.486 --> 32:30.386
"Offer the enemy bait to lure him.

32:30.389 --> 32:34.188
"Feign disorder and crush him".

32:36.996 --> 32:38.656
Or her.

32:39.398 --> 32:41.466
He also says we cannot enter alliances

32:41.467 --> 32:45.425
until we know the designs
of our neighbors. Good night.

32:48.908 --> 32:52.110
You're not even going to let me
escort you to your room?

32:52.111 --> 32:55.546
Now, what kind of a prude
would that make me?

33:31.650 --> 33:35.051
Hey, where'd you come from?

33:37.623 --> 33:40.591
Broke out of your little cage, huh?

33:42.027 --> 33:44.051
What the hell?

33:45.397 --> 33:47.728
Oh, my God.

33:49.535 --> 33:52.060
You're my new best friend.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.171
Here's to you.

33:56.241 --> 33:58.003
Colossus.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.243
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:59.244 --> 34:00.778
Hi! Great party.

34:00.779 --> 34:04.009
Don't thank me. Thank tequila.
What's up?

34:04.984 --> 34:06.576
Found your pants.

34:12.558 --> 34:16.960
Van, I took your advice about shaving
my excess body hair, and it worked.

34:16.962 --> 34:18.896
She said I'd get laid tonight.

34:18.897 --> 34:21.456
- What's her major?
- Pre-law.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.929
- Get it in writing.
- Hey, Van.

34:25.838 --> 34:30.775
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
I will get to all of you later, I promise.

34:32.911 --> 34:34.435
Wow!

34:36.281 --> 34:39.806
Hey, big man on campus.

34:40.219 --> 34:46.418
- A blessing and a curse.
- Van! Van, I need your help.

34:46.992 --> 34:49.322
- Calm down, Yu.
- I meet girl in class, "berry" sexy.

34:49.322 --> 34:52.085
- Calm down, Yu.
- I meet girl in class, "berry" sexy.

34:52.130 --> 34:56.067
So I say she beautiful.
She say, "Get lost!"

34:56.068 --> 35:00.138
So I say she smart. She say, "Get lost!"

35:00.139 --> 35:06.010
So I say, "I know Van Wilder,"
and she say, "Where your room?"

35:06.011 --> 35:09.747
Things heating up,
but first I give her Connie ring ass.

35:09.748 --> 35:12.150
- Connie who?
- Connie ring ass!

35:12.151 --> 35:14.185
- Ring ass?
- Ring ass!

35:14.186 --> 35:17.746
- Cunnilingus!
- Oh, right!

35:18.023 --> 35:21.117
So next thing, she cry, she run out!

35:24.730 --> 35:27.027
Show me what you did.

35:43.515 --> 35:48.349
Jesus, man! You're lucky you didn't
send her to the fucking hospital.

35:49.555 --> 35:52.023
Where did you learn that?

35:53.225 --> 35:57.320
- Sex "crass".
- What sex "crass"?

35:57.763 --> 36:01.632
Now, sex is achieved when
a male's sin stick is in, on,

36:01.633 --> 36:03.634
or in the same room as

36:03.635 --> 36:05.837
a female's hell hole.

36:05.838 --> 36:07.605
Now, no matter what the woman says,

36:07.606 --> 36:11.735
the act of procreation should only last
for a few seconds.

36:12.111 --> 36:16.047
And remember, if it feels good,
you're doing it wrong.

36:16.715 --> 36:20.151
Professor Downs!
There's an emergency phone call.

36:20.152 --> 36:24.055
- Your wife was in an accident.
- Tell her I'll call her later.

36:24.056 --> 36:27.354
- And she totaled your Mustang.
- That bitch!

36:27.359 --> 36:31.659
- Class, turn to pages 20 to 22 and...
- Hello.

36:32.831 --> 36:34.525
Wake up!

36:34.833 --> 36:40.066
My name is Professor Wilder.

36:40.339 --> 36:46.607
I have BA, an MA and a PhD.
And I received a BJ from a double-D.

36:49.748 --> 36:52.648
These are my teaching assistants.

36:54.686 --> 36:57.450
Welcome to Sex 101.

36:58.857 --> 37:00.224
This is hot.

37:00.225 --> 37:02.090
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

37:03.562 --> 37:04.829
This is not.

37:04.830 --> 37:06.695
- No!
- No!

37:08.667 --> 37:10.293
Hand?

37:11.036 --> 37:12.594
Bad!

37:13.405 --> 37:16.669
We call this maneuver "flanking".

37:21.246 --> 37:23.839
Who can name this position?

37:25.350 --> 37:28.152
- Yu.
- Glass Bottom Boat!

37:28.153 --> 37:30.120
And this one.

37:31.323 --> 37:33.057
Analingus!

37:33.058 --> 37:37.195
- And that one.
- Mississippi Kiss the Gypsy.

37:37.196 --> 37:42.463
Spraying Mantis.
Horny Dancer. Superman.

37:42.701 --> 37:45.931
The Gizzard of Oz!

37:46.738 --> 37:48.933
That's my favorite.

37:50.209 --> 37:54.011
- Ladies.
- Hello, hands, meet the glans.

37:54.012 --> 37:57.709
- And?
- Don't be daft, work the shaft.

37:58.083 --> 38:02.610
- Guys.
- Don't be a twit, rub that clit.

38:02.821 --> 38:04.913
You're learning!

38:05.390 --> 38:08.326
Now, remember,
always practice safe sex.

38:08.327 --> 38:12.363
But clean up after yourselves.
Condoms are like newspapers.

38:12.364 --> 38:13.998
They may be filled
with important stuff now,

38:13.999 --> 38:17.935
but you don't want them lying around
tomorrow morning.

38:17.936 --> 38:20.028
Write that down.

38:23.875 --> 38:25.740
Miss Hayes.

38:27.279 --> 38:30.548
I'll let it slide this time,
but if you plan on being teacher's pet

38:30.549 --> 38:34.018
- you really should stay after class.
- Class?

38:34.886 --> 38:36.220
You're kidding, right?

38:36.221 --> 38:40.825
Nothing from that soft-core seminar
would actually work in real life.

38:40.826 --> 38:43.886
Okay, I give you tongue if you like.

38:45.163 --> 38:48.766
The point is you put on
a disgusting display of vulgar anatomy,

38:48.767 --> 38:50.568
crude stereotypes and dirty limericks.

38:50.569 --> 38:53.367
Which you took copious notes on.

38:54.139 --> 38:55.606
This is all a game to you.

38:55.607 --> 38:59.010
It's a lot of smooth talk, and then it's
wham, bam, thank you, Van.

38:59.011 --> 39:01.812
Well, my father taught me,
if it's something worth doing,

39:01.813 --> 39:03.848
it's worth doing right.

39:03.849 --> 39:06.484
Well, my father taught me
that the best things in life

39:06.485 --> 39:08.816
are worth waiting for.

39:11.423 --> 39:14.255
- Wait.
- Catch you later, teach.

39:14.259 --> 39:19.753
Van! Van! Okay, thank you, thank you.

39:24.569 --> 39:28.368
- I'm Yu.
- I'm Dongmei.

39:37.749 --> 39:42.982
You know, I am not sure what it is,
but there is something in the air tonight.

39:43.522 --> 39:44.722
Something called...

39:44.723 --> 39:46.554
Love, girl.

39:47.125 --> 39:49.927
See, that's what the reggae music
is all about.

39:49.928 --> 39:51.062
Love and...

39:51.063 --> 39:52.723
Shrimp?

40:07.546 --> 40:08.913
Look at those.

40:08.914 --> 40:11.974
Flamethrowers! Use the flamethrowers!

40:16.088 --> 40:18.886
Permission to come inside, sir?

40:19.424 --> 40:21.459
Kaitlin, you look like a...

40:21.460 --> 40:23.188
Tramp!

40:23.395 --> 40:26.329
That's what I feel like sometimes.

40:26.431 --> 40:30.230
I mean, I know she has a boyfriend,
but it's like...

40:31.203 --> 40:34.934
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be boring you with all this.

40:36.708 --> 40:40.336
Here. I have a little surprise for us.

40:52.124 --> 40:55.491
Sweet and sour.

40:56.628 --> 41:00.586
Ready, aim, fire!

41:07.706 --> 41:09.407
Kaitlin, what's gotten into you?

41:09.408 --> 41:13.275
Let's just say I learned
a few things in class today.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.348
Kaitlin, I need my energy.

41:17.349 --> 41:20.084
I have to pass
that obstacle course in the morning.

41:20.085 --> 41:22.576
I'll give you an obstacle.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.384
Don't.

41:59.858 --> 42:03.020
I am so glad you weren't busy tonight.

42:09.301 --> 42:11.132
Go ahead.

42:38.697 --> 42:40.528
God.

42:43.969 --> 42:46.637
Put some of Professor Van's
methods to the test last night?

42:46.638 --> 42:48.472
You wish. What about you?

42:48.473 --> 42:53.103
I figured you'd be in Wilder Hall
sucking beers with Susie Sorority.

42:53.245 --> 42:55.178
Travel books.

42:56.715 --> 42:59.950
<i>I always had you pegged
as more of a Soldier of Fortune girl.</i>

42:59.951 --> 43:02.753
Traveling's one of the reasons
why I wanna be in the military.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.154
To see the world.

43:04.155 --> 43:08.489
You know, there are vacations
that don't involve machine guns.

43:08.593 --> 43:10.390
Oh, right.

43:10.428 --> 43:12.897
Spring break in Mexico,
winters in the Caribbean.

43:12.898 --> 43:15.992
You probably spent summer
in Amsterdam.

43:17.168 --> 43:22.901
I think it's important to familiarize
oneself with international tongues.

43:23.542 --> 43:28.172
- Life's just one big party, isn't it?
- Why shouldn't it be?

43:28.313 --> 43:31.181
Last time I checked,
we only go around once, right?

43:31.182 --> 43:33.651
Unless you believe in reincarnation.

43:33.652 --> 43:38.248
In that case, I wanna come back
as a ThighMaster.

43:40.258 --> 43:41.918
What?

43:45.030 --> 43:47.657
Hey! Wait up!

43:47.799 --> 43:50.501
You know, you could be
a great leader if you just learned

43:50.502 --> 43:52.102
how to follow orders first.

43:52.103 --> 43:54.705
Not a big fan
of authority figures, actually.

43:54.706 --> 43:57.875
- Someone has father issues.
- That makes two of us.

43:57.876 --> 44:00.310
- Excuse me?
- Come on.

44:00.545 --> 44:03.881
The whole military routine,
the tough exterior.

44:03.882 --> 44:05.983
You don't know anything
about my father or me.

44:05.984 --> 44:08.752
- You just see a uniform and...
- You just see a name on a building.

44:08.753 --> 44:11.422
Well, why don't you surprise me?

44:11.423 --> 44:16.326
All right. First of all,
I've never even been in Wilder Hall.

44:16.828 --> 44:20.491
And secondly,
for someone who's so big on rules,

44:23.234 --> 44:24.568
here it is.

44:24.569 --> 44:27.071
"Student undergarments should be
as modest

44:27.072 --> 44:30.006
"and unrevealing as possible".

44:30.208 --> 44:34.144
- So?
- So my sixth sense is telling me...

44:36.748 --> 44:40.149
- You're a thong girl.
- What? No, I'm not.

44:40.218 --> 44:43.354
- My sixth sense does not lie.
- Well, it does this time.

44:43.355 --> 44:45.356
And in the future,
you might want to keep it,

44:45.357 --> 44:50.351
and the rest of your senses to yourself.
Some things are private, Private.

44:55.433 --> 45:01.064
Corporal, I think it's time we take things
to the next level.

45:01.106 --> 45:04.108
I have waited so long
to hear you say that.

45:04.109 --> 45:06.577
- What?
- Nothing, I...

45:07.846 --> 45:10.714
Eve! Jesus, you almost scared
the courage out of me.

45:10.715 --> 45:13.584
Hey, Dirk, I was just wondering
if you could help me.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.186
- With what?
- I need to talk to God.

45:16.187 --> 45:17.888
So go talk to him. I'm busy.

45:17.889 --> 45:20.857
I need to feel him inside of me.

45:23.461 --> 45:25.663
Don't you wanna help me find God?

45:25.664 --> 45:29.600
- Listen. I don't know what you're on...
- Just fuck me!

45:30.669 --> 45:32.136
Get away from me, devil woman!

45:32.137 --> 45:33.270
- Dirk!
- Faster!

45:33.271 --> 45:34.738
You get back here!

45:34.939 --> 45:37.374
Yes, I bought you toilet paper.

45:37.375 --> 45:40.605
No, it's not quilted. Golly!

45:44.683 --> 45:47.413
I won't ask if you don't tell?

45:50.288 --> 45:53.882
What the... Hey, put me down!

45:57.696 --> 46:00.030
Is this where you bring all the boys?

46:00.031 --> 46:02.466
Oh, yeah, you're a real comedian.

46:02.467 --> 46:06.670
You like cracking your jokes,
throwing your little parties,

46:06.671 --> 46:09.640
sticking your tongue
in other people's property?

46:09.641 --> 46:12.609
Can someone get this guy a Tic Tac?

46:12.911 --> 46:16.413
Well, I got news for you, Mr. Cool Guy,

46:16.414 --> 46:21.817
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll, Mr. Hot Crotch!

46:23.021 --> 46:28.025
Your party-boy bullshit
has no place here at Coolidge.

46:28.026 --> 46:30.527
And you're about to find out
the hard way.

46:30.528 --> 46:31.628
I wanna watch!

46:31.629 --> 46:35.155
This should teach you
not to mess with my girl.

46:39.504 --> 46:41.232
Hold him!

46:43.908 --> 46:46.467
Come on, Wilder. Drink up!

46:50.849 --> 46:52.748
Had enough?

46:53.118 --> 46:57.213
You wouldn't happen to have
a pale ale on tap, would you?

46:58.857 --> 47:00.585
Screw it.

47:03.812 --> 47:05.870
How your face feel?

47:07.215 --> 47:09.410
Like a punching bag.

47:09.551 --> 47:12.576
Maybe you should find another girl.

47:12.821 --> 47:15.789
No, it's not just the girl, Farley.

47:15.924 --> 47:20.561
Dirk and Reardon and all the rest
of those Cro-Magnon crotch diggers

47:20.562 --> 47:24.657
need to learn they can't run
this place like Guantanamo U.

47:29.638 --> 47:34.040
Oh, man! Who's been feeding
that dog corn again?

47:37.813 --> 47:40.781
Farley, get some gloves.

47:44.553 --> 47:46.680
All right, girls!

47:48.924 --> 47:52.760
This is covert ops! I want it by the book!

47:52.761 --> 47:54.195
Now camo up! Let's go!

47:54.196 --> 47:56.891
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Sir, yes, sir!

47:57.532 --> 48:01.263
- Jesus, it smells.
- Come on! Faster! Move! Yeah!

48:01.336 --> 48:03.133
Put it on!

48:03.672 --> 48:05.867
Mother of God!

48:06.575 --> 48:09.009
Sir, he's right. It smells like...

48:09.010 --> 48:12.179
What do you want it
to smell like? Roses?

48:12.180 --> 48:14.011
Put it on!

48:23.258 --> 48:27.285
All right, troops, one mile left.
Double time! Let's go!

48:29.531 --> 48:33.364
- What happened to your face?
- I ran into a tool.

48:40.075 --> 48:41.675
Oh, Dirk!

48:41.676 --> 48:45.634
Not now, honeybear,
we're in the middle of covert ops!

48:45.680 --> 48:48.215
- What's that smell?
- That smell?

48:48.216 --> 48:51.014
- Yeah.
- It's the smell of war!

48:53.388 --> 48:55.879
Well, it smells like crap.

49:00.896 --> 49:05.423
- Is that corn?
- Back to base showers now!

49:07.435 --> 49:09.698
Ran into a tool, huh?

49:18.880 --> 49:21.549
- Wilder is dead!
- Dirk, what are you doing here?

49:21.550 --> 49:24.552
- It's against the rules.
- I don't care about the rules.

49:24.553 --> 49:27.121
- Now you sound like Van.
- No. No, no, no.

49:27.122 --> 49:29.957
Don't you dare say that name to me!
I don't even wanna...

49:29.958 --> 49:34.228
I don't even wanna hear that name!

49:34.229 --> 49:37.731
- Dirk, calm down.
- You're forbidden to see him again.

49:37.732 --> 49:39.867
Excuse me?
You can't tell me who to see.

49:39.868 --> 49:41.268
Oh, you heard me, Corporal.

49:41.269 --> 49:45.205
I don't want you to see him.
You don't talk to him. Period!

49:45.674 --> 49:48.642
Or what? You'll beat him up again?

49:48.643 --> 49:52.010
He's not one of us, Kaitlin!

49:52.681 --> 49:54.671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:55.417 --> 49:59.219
Well, then, I don't wanna be one of us,
either. Get out, Dirk!

49:59.220 --> 50:02.389
Wait, what? You can't break up with me.

50:02.390 --> 50:05.593
We have cuddle-wuddle time
at 2100 hours.

50:05.594 --> 50:07.789
Cuddle your gun.

50:13.301 --> 50:16.292
Oh, and you can keep
Major McHuggles!

50:30.752 --> 50:33.015
Where are the others?

50:33.021 --> 50:34.722
Just you and me today, soldier.

50:34.723 --> 50:38.192
Figured you need
a little one-on-one training.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.661
You have 10 minutes to run the course.

50:40.662 --> 50:43.357
Let's see if you can keep up.

50:43.498 --> 50:46.000
Care to make it interesting?

50:46.001 --> 50:49.169
If I win, you have to let me take you out.

50:49.170 --> 50:52.503
Nothing sexual,
just a tour around campus.

50:52.674 --> 50:54.141
And if you don't?

50:54.142 --> 50:57.011
I'll do latrine duty for a month.

50:57.012 --> 51:00.447
- You're on.
- Great. When do I start?

51:00.448 --> 51:02.575
You already have.

52:20.695 --> 52:22.796
You're running out of time!

52:22.797 --> 52:24.898
I can't. I don't have any...

52:24.899 --> 52:29.570
Come on. You have 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight...

52:29.571 --> 52:31.470
Hey, Wilder!

52:32.207 --> 52:34.766
Do you want this, or what?

52:41.883 --> 52:43.951
I knew you had it in you.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.919
Piece of cake.

52:46.287 --> 52:49.556
Let me know if you find my right testicle.

52:49.557 --> 52:52.992
Come on, milk dud.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.429
Mother!

52:55.964 --> 52:57.795
All right.

53:01.336 --> 53:03.704
Look at 'em, Lieutenant.

53:03.705 --> 53:06.907
Morons, listening to their retard rock.

53:06.908 --> 53:10.544
Horn dogs, tongue-dancing,
like cousins in a closet.

53:10.545 --> 53:12.613
You see what's happening down there,
don't you?

53:12.614 --> 53:15.446
Chaos, anarchy, ironic T-shirts.

53:17.118 --> 53:21.088
I'm losing control, damn it,
and I refuse to let that happen.

53:21.089 --> 53:23.955
Do you know who's behind it, sir?

53:24.192 --> 53:26.059
I know who's behind it, all right.

53:26.060 --> 53:30.621
It's that same rooster that's been
sniffing around your hen house.

53:34.302 --> 53:38.005
Looks like somebody
needs another beating!

53:38.006 --> 53:39.573
Forget it.

53:39.574 --> 53:41.508
Beating him up is like beating off.

53:41.509 --> 53:43.877
It might feel good doing it,
but in the end,

53:43.878 --> 53:46.046
we're just standing there
with our dicks in our hands.

53:46.047 --> 53:49.710
- No. We need something more.
- I could...

53:50.451 --> 53:52.286
Beat up his roommate, sir.

53:52.287 --> 53:55.255
God damn it, boy. You stupid?

53:55.657 --> 53:57.647
Wait a minute.

53:58.126 --> 54:00.127
Isn't his roommate that pothead?

54:00.128 --> 54:02.027
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:02.964 --> 54:05.762
Lieutenant, I have got an idea.

54:42.303 --> 54:45.706
Milady, your chariot awaits.

54:45.707 --> 54:49.233
- How did you get this?
- Chuck lent it to me.

54:49.444 --> 54:51.468
We go way back.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.240
Thanks.

55:01.856 --> 55:03.390
This is incredible.

55:03.391 --> 55:05.525
You said you always
wanted to see the world.

55:05.526 --> 55:07.995
I thought we'd start with the tropics.

55:07.996 --> 55:12.398
Oh, I almost forgot,
the most important part.

55:15.136 --> 55:17.738
- What is it?
- It's my own concoction.

55:17.739 --> 55:20.607
- I call it the amputated leg.
- Why?

55:20.608 --> 55:24.839
'Cause if you have more
than one, you're flat on your ass.

55:40.328 --> 55:44.355
Christ! Look at this place.
It's like a homo's paradise.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.902
- You want a cosmo?
- Put that down! Put it down!

55:48.903 --> 55:51.462
Get over here! Stupid ass.

55:53.107 --> 55:55.336
You have the stuff?

55:56.010 --> 55:59.411
You have no idea
where I had to hide this.

56:01.983 --> 56:03.951
Put it over there in that plant thingy.

56:03.952 --> 56:07.751
Technically, that's a variegated ficus.
It really...

56:17.699 --> 56:19.299
Yes, hello. I'd like to report
the possession

56:19.300 --> 56:21.791
of some illegal narcotics.

56:22.136 --> 56:25.205
I can't believe I'm doing this,
blowing off my homework,

56:25.206 --> 56:28.408
drinking and riding
in a stolen vehicle, no less.

56:28.409 --> 56:30.604
God bless America.

56:31.512 --> 56:35.015
You know, what you've done here,
it's pretty great.

56:35.016 --> 56:37.684
Well, Farley's the one
who scooped out the pineapple.

56:37.685 --> 56:41.552
Shut up. I mean here, this, Coolidge.

56:41.956 --> 56:45.118
I don't know. People seem happier.

56:45.193 --> 56:47.361
That's because
they're thinking for themselves.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.763
They don't have some father figure
telling them what to do.

56:49.764 --> 56:52.459
Oh, back to the father issues.

56:53.935 --> 56:55.969
You know a little bit about mine.

56:55.970 --> 56:58.972
- What about yours?
- Well, let's see.

56:58.973 --> 57:01.842
My father's a sergeant.
His father was a sergeant.

57:01.843 --> 57:04.144
He always wanted a son
who was an officer.

57:04.145 --> 57:06.313
Guess I'm just trying to get it half right.

57:06.314 --> 57:10.545
Yeah, but the real question is,
is this what makes you happy?

57:11.185 --> 57:13.720
Family makes me happy. Tradition.

57:13.721 --> 57:17.324
Tradition is something that keeps
greeting-card companies in business.

57:17.325 --> 57:21.428
I think at some point you gotta say,
"I'm gonna do what I wanna do, Dad.

57:21.429 --> 57:23.997
"So quit busting my balls".

57:23.998 --> 57:27.401
Yeah, I'll be sure to mention that when
I have dinner with him this weekend.

57:27.402 --> 57:30.598
You might wanna leave out
the balls part.

57:31.005 --> 57:33.370
We should have a toast.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.641
- To Coolidge.
- To you.

57:43.017 --> 57:44.711
To us.

57:54.095 --> 57:56.363
Shall I take you home?

57:56.364 --> 57:59.800
Actually, there's something
that I've heard about

57:59.801 --> 58:02.394
that I've been dying to see.

58:03.838 --> 58:06.329
My God, it's huge.

58:07.975 --> 58:11.035
Well, Farley and I both live here.

58:11.112 --> 58:12.646
Yu uses the hot tub.

58:12.647 --> 58:17.641
I think this is the bigger than some of
the military housing I grew up in.

58:18.152 --> 58:20.420
I think it's a lot like me.

58:20.421 --> 58:25.153
Simple yet elegant. Coarse but refined,

58:25.493 --> 58:29.053
and it could definitely use a woman's

58:29.997 --> 58:31.531
touch.

58:31.532 --> 58:34.262
I've always wanted to do that.

58:43.478 --> 58:46.276
The amputated leg strikes again.

58:47.081 --> 58:50.851
- Are your roommates around?
- I sent them to the movies.

58:50.852 --> 58:54.821
- So they'll be back soon.
- I sent them to all the movies.

58:54.822 --> 58:56.356
That's good.

58:56.357 --> 58:59.926
With Dirk, I always felt like someone
was gonna break down the door.

58:59.927 --> 59:01.792
Don't move!

59:02.463 --> 59:04.590
Search the place.

59:04.866 --> 59:07.033
Are you in some kind of trouble?

59:07.034 --> 59:11.705
Either that, or the library has seriously
changed its overdue-book policy.

59:11.706 --> 59:14.474
We got an anonymous tip
that there are some illegal narcotics

59:14.475 --> 59:17.341
being hidden in the plant thingy.

59:19.680 --> 59:23.081
There's nothing in the bag.
It's empty, sir.

59:23.985 --> 59:25.975
False alarm.

59:27.522 --> 59:30.252
You kids have a nice evening.

59:32.059 --> 59:35.187
Oh, and don't forget to wrap it up.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.297
What just happened?

59:44.005 --> 59:46.632
What wrong with Colossus?

59:47.341 --> 59:50.577
Damn, yo, that dog is mad blazed.

59:50.578 --> 59:53.376
He must've eaten a whole pound.

59:54.048 --> 59:59.247
Hey, don't be lookin' at me, man.
I keep my stuff right here.

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:02.455
Hydroponic.

01:00:02.456 --> 01:00:04.891
You know,
messing with me is one thing,

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:07.451
but nobody screws my pooch.

01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:09.296
It's Dirk. It's gotta be.

01:00:09.297 --> 01:00:12.399
He's trying to get even with me
for breaking up with him.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.467
You two broke up?

01:00:14.468 --> 01:00:16.336
Sorry to hear that.

01:00:16.337 --> 01:00:19.465
I just can't believe he'd go this far.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.442
I don't think he did.

01:00:22.443 --> 01:00:26.743
I think old Dirky boy's playing
Vanna to someone else's Sajak.

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.243
And now it's our turn to spin the wheel.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.752
What do you mean, he wasn't arrested?

01:00:32.753 --> 01:00:34.521
We didn't find any drugs.

01:00:34.522 --> 01:00:37.857
Officer, can you tell me why,
at such a fine institute

01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:41.452
of higher learning,
I'm surrounded by idiots?

01:00:41.462 --> 01:00:44.764
<i>- It's time for your massage, sir.
- Send them in.</i>

01:00:44.765 --> 01:00:47.426
Get out. You're incompetent.

01:00:53.007 --> 01:00:55.839
One? I usually have two girls.

01:00:56.877 --> 01:00:59.607
Me no disappoint.

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:04.044
Holy Schwarzkopf.

01:01:04.385 --> 01:01:06.147
Oh, yeah.

01:01:13.995 --> 01:01:15.810
Hairy, hairy chest. I like it!

01:01:15.811 --> 01:01:17.664
Hairy, hairy chest. I like it!

01:01:17.665 --> 01:01:20.395
Hello. Is this Mrs. Reardon?

01:01:23.938 --> 01:01:28.272
Big, strong Gl.

01:01:28.776 --> 01:01:31.778
You know, you Charlie ain't so bad.

01:01:31.779 --> 01:01:34.713
Shame we had to beat you in 'Nam.

01:01:38.185 --> 01:01:42.781
- You want happy ending?
- Does an Arab shit in the sand?

01:01:47.628 --> 01:01:52.531
- What's this?
- Not polite to watch, only to feel.

01:01:56.937 --> 01:02:00.167
Why your soldier not stand at attention?

01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:02.433
It will, it will.

01:02:10.718 --> 01:02:12.776
Very good.

01:02:20.261 --> 01:02:23.491
This is something you'll like very much!

01:02:23.597 --> 01:02:26.088
I cannot wait very much.

01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:28.768
Yeah.

01:02:28.969 --> 01:02:32.961
Your soldier stand at attention now.

01:02:33.174 --> 01:02:36.276
- You likey, likey?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:02:36.277 --> 01:02:40.838
- You ready for mouth massage?
- Bring it on.

01:02:41.582 --> 01:02:43.982
Here it come.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:53.883
Easy there, easy there.

01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:57.125
- Feel good?
- Watch it.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:58.631
Watch Huck and Buck, there.

01:02:58.632 --> 01:03:00.497
No touching.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.829
That feels good.

01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:14.576
That is so hot.

01:03:23.224 --> 01:03:24.986
Charles!

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:38.070
So dirty.

01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:42.369
I promise I will never make you
do anything like that ever again.

01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:49.239
Given the events of this afternoon,

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:52.185
there is only one thing
in the world that I want.

01:03:52.186 --> 01:03:55.054
- A rabies shot, sir?
- No, God damn it!

01:03:55.055 --> 01:03:56.589
I want Wilder.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:00.457
He's turned my wife against me,
my school against me,

01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:05.195
he even turned my dog against me.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.567
Wish we could just kick him out!

01:04:07.568 --> 01:04:10.570
There's gotta be some way
I could just force him to leave.

01:04:10.571 --> 01:04:14.974
Oh, I would love to see the look
on his dad's face

01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:16.810
when he finds out his son is expelled.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:19.579
I would love to see the look
on Kaitlin's dad's face

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.182
when he realizes
that his daughter's new boyfriend

01:04:22.183 --> 01:04:23.817
isn't joining the Army.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.411
Will you shut the hell...

01:04:28.022 --> 01:04:30.581
- Whose dad?
- Kaitlin's.

01:04:33.861 --> 01:04:35.559
Lieutenant! I've got it.

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:37.964
We are gonna finish Wilder.

01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:41.534
- And your former squeeze, too.
- Yes, sir!

01:04:41.535 --> 01:04:44.804
In order to do that,
I have a very important mission for you.

01:04:44.805 --> 01:04:47.705
I need you to find me some skanks.

01:04:48.509 --> 01:04:51.678
Well, I'm sorry Kaitlin,
but it's your turn for guard duty.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.170
No more special treatment.

01:04:56.884 --> 01:05:00.182
Nothing personal, Corporal.
Just be there.

01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:05.048
It's set. You think you can get
your friends to go along?

01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:08.495
They'll do whatever I tell them to do.

01:05:08.496 --> 01:05:10.224
Awesome.

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:15.764
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Oh, Satan!

01:05:20.774 --> 01:05:23.902
What? What are you doing? Don't stop!

01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:27.178
Out of ammo.

01:05:28.782 --> 01:05:30.306
Hand me your gun!

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:39.224
Ten-hut!

01:05:40.995 --> 01:05:43.156
I taught him that.

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:51.360
What's wrong?

01:05:52.206 --> 01:05:53.968
It's Dirk.

01:05:54.308 --> 01:05:56.409
He knew I was going to dinner tonight
with my father,

01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:00.004
and he deliberately
scheduled me for guard duty.

01:06:00.147 --> 01:06:02.012
So don't go.

01:06:02.383 --> 01:06:05.485
Van, guard duty isn't something
you can just shrug off.

01:06:05.486 --> 01:06:09.355
If you miss it, or screw up,
it can ruin your career. It's serious.

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:13.019
Which is exactly how the boys
and I will treat it.

01:06:13.227 --> 01:06:16.763
- You're gonna do it?
- Hey, I know it's not toilets,

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:19.357
but I think I can handle it.

01:06:21.235 --> 01:06:23.726
What, don't you trust me?

01:06:23.971 --> 01:06:25.836
I trust you.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:48.428
But we have dates tonight! Hot ones!

01:06:48.429 --> 01:06:49.729
Irving, trust me.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.266
That sucking action is not realistic,
no matter what it says on the box.

01:06:53.267 --> 01:06:57.703
I mean real dates this time, Van!
Hot ones.

01:06:57.771 --> 01:07:00.262
- Human females?
- Hot ones.

01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:03.242
Tell you what. They can come along.

01:07:03.243 --> 01:07:08.703
Yes! Up, up, down, down, left,
right, left, right, B, A, start!

01:07:09.183 --> 01:07:11.618
Now, what exactly are we guarding?

01:07:11.619 --> 01:07:14.754
You will not get inside
Colonel Reardon's Humvee.

01:07:14.755 --> 01:07:19.885
You do not touch the Humvee.
You do not look at the Humvee.

01:07:19.893 --> 01:07:21.361
Then how are we supposed
to guard them?

01:07:21.362 --> 01:07:24.092
You do not look at the Humvee!

01:07:25.966 --> 01:07:27.490
Now,

01:07:28.869 --> 01:07:33.169
this guard duty better come out
smooth as a bran muffin shit,

01:07:33.707 --> 01:07:37.301
or somebody's gonna have their ass
handed to 'em.

01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:39.679
Any questions?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.978
Will you be the one
doing the ass handling?

01:07:45.786 --> 01:07:49.517
Don't worry, Wilder. Yours is coming.

01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:57.422
I am really starting to like that guy.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:09.475
- So, how's college?
- It's great.

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:13.079
I'm taking a lot of interesting courses.
Military history, psychology...

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.581
You know, Dirk called me the other day.

01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:18.380
Said you had broken up with him.

01:08:18.519 --> 01:08:20.850
Yeah, well,

01:08:21.587 --> 01:08:23.885
I met somebody else.

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:26.426
He a military man?

01:08:26.426 --> 01:08:30.260
He respects the military.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:34.426
Ladies.

01:08:34.835 --> 01:08:38.634
Irving! You invited the "dick" girls?

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:40.973
This is a bad idea.

01:08:40.974 --> 01:08:43.567
Van, don't be such a dork.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.337
Howdy, heathen.

01:08:50.984 --> 01:08:52.819
Well, honey, with school and Dirk,

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:55.188
and everything that's been
going on around here,

01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:57.689
I just wanna know one thing. Are you...

01:08:57.691 --> 01:09:00.682
- Yes, Dad. I'm happy.
- That's great.

01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:04.786
But are you still on track
for officer training school?

01:09:09.502 --> 01:09:10.970
Listen, guys.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:14.073
Maybe we should slow down
just a little bit.

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:17.510
I am Mars, god of war!

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:21.640
Who amongst you shall engage
in body shots?

01:09:24.318 --> 01:09:28.049
Hey, soldier! Wanna fuck?

01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.925
No. Thank you.

01:09:32.926 --> 01:09:34.859
I do anal.

01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:41.067
Corporal Hayes.
As you were, as you were.

01:09:41.068 --> 01:09:43.435
I was on the other side
of the restaurant. I didn't see you.

01:09:43.437 --> 01:09:45.571
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:47.673
The pleasure's all mine, Sergeant.
I didn't realize Miss Hayes

01:09:47.674 --> 01:09:50.142
came from such good stock.

01:09:50.277 --> 01:09:54.247
Well, hopefully she will climb
a bit higher up the ladder than I did, sir.

01:09:54.247 --> 01:09:57.683
I have no doubt, Sergeant.
Kaitlin is officer material all the way.

01:09:57.684 --> 01:09:59.519
Her record is flawless.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.654
Say, you're about done here.
I was just heading back to the base.

01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:05.324
Would you like a tour? You could see
your daughter's unit in action.

01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:06.993
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.621
- I'd love to, sir.
- Dad!

01:10:09.763 --> 01:10:12.165
I'm really proud of you. Love to see it.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.866
Come on. Show off for your old man.
Let's go.

01:10:13.867 --> 01:10:15.334
- Please?
- Okay.

01:10:15.335 --> 01:10:18.633
- You're gonna enjoy this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:23.176
Oh, you know what? I forgot my purse,
so I'll meet you outside, okay?

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.269
- All right.
- Okay.

01:10:26.713 --> 01:10:28.614
You know what I wanna do to you?

01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:31.150
Leave me alone permanently?

01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:34.487
Hey, watch that! Hey, stop... Hey!

01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:36.353
No means no.

01:10:46.567 --> 01:10:49.160
Come on, Van. Pick up.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:53.904
Miss Hayes.

01:10:54.107 --> 01:10:55.904
Shall we?

01:11:11.525 --> 01:11:15.290
You're about to be very proud
about what you'll see.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.332
What in God's name...

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:28.700
Kaitlin, this is your unit?

01:11:29.309 --> 01:11:31.640
For the last time, no!

01:11:31.712 --> 01:11:33.372
Van?

01:11:36.183 --> 01:11:38.878
You must be Kaitlin's father.

01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:43.456
Corporal Hayes, I thought you were
a better leader than this.

01:11:43.457 --> 01:11:46.158
I thought you were officer material.

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:48.494
Do you understand
what the consequences of this will be?

01:11:48.495 --> 01:11:50.663
- Colonel Reardon, I...
- She will accept

01:11:50.664 --> 01:11:53.997
any punishment you deem fit, sir.

01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:56.396
Wait. I can explain.

01:11:56.503 --> 01:11:58.937
Kaitlin, let me explain.

01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:03.434
- That a boy, Dirk.
- My pleasure, sir.

01:12:03.477 --> 01:12:05.672
Let's go, Kaitlin.

01:12:06.513 --> 01:12:08.037
Now.

01:12:08.148 --> 01:12:10.309
You're disgusting.

01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:14.547
Call me.

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:22.094
You realize it's my duty
to make a report of this.

01:12:22.095 --> 01:12:25.932
Gonna put a pretty big stain
on her pretty little record.

01:12:25.933 --> 01:12:29.135
But it's about time you learn there are
some people you don't fuck with.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.037
What do you want from me?

01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:34.540
Isn't it obvious?
I want you gone, out, quit.

01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:37.510
Running home to Daddy
with your tail between your legs.

01:12:37.511 --> 01:12:39.245
What if I say no?

01:12:39.246 --> 01:12:41.781
Well, then I guess Miss Hayes'
military career will be coming

01:12:41.782 --> 01:12:44.876
to a rather premature and ignoble end.

01:12:45.886 --> 01:12:47.320
Tell you what.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.155
Having some people over
for dinner tomorrow night

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.057
to discuss our annual war games.

01:12:51.058 --> 01:12:53.359
Why don't you give me
your decision then?

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.452
Good seeing you.

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:41.229
A Wilder never quits.

01:14:41.802 --> 01:14:44.603
So I said, "I've got some
affirmative action for you.

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:46.639
"I can affirm that your dumbass kid
won't be getting

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.165
"any action at my school".

01:14:50.744 --> 01:14:52.233
Yo!

01:14:52.245 --> 01:14:54.212
Cap'n Crunch!

01:14:55.649 --> 01:14:57.583
I've made my decision.

01:14:57.584 --> 01:15:00.619
I've decided we should settle this,
once and for all.

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.290
Like men. No more sneaking,
no more backstabbing.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.783
Let's just get it all right out in the open.

01:15:08.428 --> 01:15:10.196
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:15:10.197 --> 01:15:13.065
You've got a problem with my father,

01:15:13.066 --> 01:15:16.635
a problem with my name,
and that's too bad.

01:15:16.636 --> 01:15:20.172
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit around and let you

01:15:20.173 --> 01:15:24.143
and your little peons
flush this school down the toilet

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:25.744
and hurt the people I care about,

01:15:25.745 --> 01:15:28.347
because, even though you dragged her
into this,

01:15:28.348 --> 01:15:31.550
this has never really been
about Kaitlin, who,

01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:36.283
on her worst day, will be a better officer
than you ever were.

01:15:37.224 --> 01:15:42.127
That girl's got bigger balls than you, me,
and my freakish dog combined.

01:15:42.562 --> 01:15:47.466
I have had enough
of these little games, Wilder.

01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:49.161
Get out.

01:15:49.436 --> 01:15:51.198
Games?

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:53.572
You wanna play games?

01:15:53.573 --> 01:15:57.270
How about
one of your precious little war games?

01:15:57.978 --> 01:16:01.280
Loser leaves Coolidge. For good.

01:16:01.281 --> 01:16:03.942
What do you think about that?

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:08.154
I think you're in
for an old-fashioned ass-kicking, son.

01:16:08.155 --> 01:16:11.385
If I was your son, I'd kick my own ass.

01:16:17.631 --> 01:16:19.428
I'm sorry.

01:16:24.271 --> 01:16:27.365
You're finished, Wilder. Finished.

01:16:28.842 --> 01:16:32.077
Miss Hayes,
in light of Mr. Wilder's behavior

01:16:32.078 --> 01:16:35.347
I am going to remove
last night's incident from your record,

01:16:35.348 --> 01:16:39.084
and I am giving you
my official recommendation

01:16:39.085 --> 01:16:41.220
for officer training school.

01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.211
Thank you, sir.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.958
But I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

01:16:45.959 --> 01:16:48.227
The officer training school
only accepts those who have

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:50.429
received the most honorable training.

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:54.525
Your name on my recommendation
would render me ineligible.

01:16:55.802 --> 01:16:58.930
In other words, sir, go fuck yourself!

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:09.011
Kaitlin!

01:17:11.751 --> 01:17:13.479
Kaitlin.

01:17:14.054 --> 01:17:16.818
I blew it, Dad. I'm so sorry.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.628
- He's right.
- What?

01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:25.864
Kaitlin, I wanted you to be a soldier.

01:17:25.865 --> 01:17:27.662
I still do.

01:17:28.068 --> 01:17:30.436
But if getting there means having
to march in a line that's crooked,

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:32.996
then it ain't worth a damn.

01:17:33.873 --> 01:17:37.809
You don't join the Army to follow.
You join it to lead.

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:41.504
And the only way to lead
is to do what's right.

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:46.208
That's my girl.

01:17:48.788 --> 01:17:50.723
None of this is gonna work.

01:17:50.724 --> 01:17:53.792
We need a man who actually knows
what the hell he's doing.

01:17:53.793 --> 01:17:55.920
How about a woman?

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:07.003
Kaitlin, I swear to God,
I never touched her.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.439
Okay? It was man rape.

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:14.207
Save it. I only wanna know one thing.

01:18:15.682 --> 01:18:19.117
Are you ready to enter an alliance,
neighbor?

01:18:24.758 --> 01:18:26.987
It seems he is.

01:18:27.127 --> 01:18:29.857
Okay, enough of the soft stuff.

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.698
Reardon's got us outnumbered
five to one,

01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:35.634
so there's no way
we can take him head on.

01:18:35.635 --> 01:18:37.569
We're gonna fight him
on our own terms.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:39.238
What do we do?

01:18:39.239 --> 01:18:43.368
We do the only thing you guys
know how to do. We have fun.

01:18:47.013 --> 01:18:50.949
Anyone who loses an armband
will be considered captured.

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:53.652
Whoever captures
the other team's general wins.

01:18:53.653 --> 01:18:56.455
Reardon's Raiders, who's your general?

01:18:56.456 --> 01:18:58.891
Charles Stonewall Reardon, sir!

01:18:58.892 --> 01:19:01.760
Your team will wear the yellow bands.

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:04.695
Team Maverick, who's your general?

01:19:06.633 --> 01:19:08.725
That would be me.

01:19:10.303 --> 01:19:13.601
How's it hanging, Chuck? You miss me?

01:19:15.608 --> 01:19:17.234
Hey.

01:19:18.244 --> 01:19:21.304
Your team will wear the orange bands.

01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:24.843
The game begins
when you hear the siren.

01:19:25.785 --> 01:19:28.253
I hope you're prepared, gentlemen.

01:19:28.254 --> 01:19:30.813
Someone's going home today.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.696
All right, let's listen up.
First squad, take the left flank,

01:19:37.697 --> 01:19:42.065
past the lake. Second squad, right flank.

01:19:42.302 --> 01:19:44.827
Third squad, head on.

01:19:45.338 --> 01:19:47.601
And our recon team,

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:51.076
well, let's just say
they have a head start.

01:19:51.077 --> 01:19:52.611
Lieutenant Arnold will stay with me.

01:19:52.612 --> 01:19:55.013
Corporal Benedict,
you'll guard the Humvee.

01:19:55.014 --> 01:19:56.582
All right, men, there's the siren.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.350
Now, let's get these bastards!

01:19:58.351 --> 01:20:00.478
- Raiders!
- Raiders!

01:20:01.788 --> 01:20:04.089
Colonel, we got recon
on the radio for you.

01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.558
Recon, report. Can you see their base?

01:20:06.559 --> 01:20:08.761
- I have a visual, sir.
- What's going on?

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.230
- Shots, sir.
- Jesus Christ, they're firing at us?

01:20:11.231 --> 01:20:13.565
<i>No, sir. Jell-O shots.</i>

01:20:13.566 --> 01:20:15.934
<i>I repeat, Jell-O shots.
They've got the blast!</i>

01:20:15.935 --> 01:20:18.437
- They've got explosives?
- No, sir.

01:20:18.438 --> 01:20:22.840
The Jell-O shots with a blueberry blast.
It's my favorite, sir.

01:20:23.042 --> 01:20:24.109
What the hell's he talking about?

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:25.244
Sounds like they're having a goddamn...

01:20:25.245 --> 01:20:28.737
Party!

01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:41.352
So, where did all this sand come from?

01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:44.259
Thank Sheik Mohammad.

01:20:45.265 --> 01:20:46.789
Who?

01:20:51.037 --> 01:20:52.938
- How we doing?
- We're up.

01:20:52.939 --> 01:20:55.373
Give Reardon the feed.

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:59.211
Recon report.

01:20:59.212 --> 01:21:01.713
Sir. Something's happening
with the monitor.

01:21:01.714 --> 01:21:03.382
<i>Testing, testing, check, check, hello.</i>

01:21:03.383 --> 01:21:07.046
<i>I'm sorry, they can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

01:21:07.053 --> 01:21:08.387
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

01:21:08.388 --> 01:21:11.023
How the hell did you eliminate my men?

01:21:11.024 --> 01:21:15.051
<i>Chuck, "eliminate" is such an ugly word.</i>

01:21:15.462 --> 01:21:17.896
<i>Van Wilder rules!</i>

01:21:23.736 --> 01:21:25.938
You tell first squad to move in.

01:21:25.939 --> 01:21:28.907
And have Benedict on standby
with my Humvee.

01:21:28.908 --> 01:21:31.103
<i>Corporal Benedict!</i>

01:21:33.313 --> 01:21:34.646
Yes, sir!

01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:36.415
<i>Stand by for deployment.</i>

01:21:36.416 --> 01:21:37.649
Yes, sir.

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:39.918
You heard him!
Stand by for deployment!

01:21:39.919 --> 01:21:41.647
That way!

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:55.432
Hey, guys!

01:21:58.104 --> 01:22:00.469
Come skinny-dipping!

01:22:06.112 --> 01:22:07.909
What the hell?

01:22:09.516 --> 01:22:12.382
I seen this in a porno once.

01:22:12.752 --> 01:22:15.120
- Have you seen this before?
- Don't be scared.

01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:17.088
Jump in, baby.

01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:25.261
Wait for me!

01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:45.241
First squad, report! Report, damn it!

01:22:46.386 --> 01:22:49.855
Sorry about your troops, Chuck,
but they decided to make love,

01:22:49.856 --> 01:22:51.550
not war.

01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:57.251
Son of a bitch.

01:22:58.398 --> 01:23:00.229
<i>Gotta conga.</i>

01:23:12.979 --> 01:23:14.639
Hello!

01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:19.318
- Sir, we found their general.
- I hooked myself into a sand trap.

01:23:19.319 --> 01:23:22.955
Well, don't just stand there,
capture him, you jackass!

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:24.684
Grab him!

01:23:28.695 --> 01:23:31.390
Give me the armband, General.

01:23:31.831 --> 01:23:34.526
I told you it was a sand trap.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:39.464
Ladies.

01:23:46.245 --> 01:23:48.235
I still got it.

01:23:48.448 --> 01:23:51.007
Well, did they get him?

01:23:51.117 --> 01:23:52.982
Not exactly.

01:23:58.791 --> 01:24:01.059
- Permission to get angry, sir.
- Denied.

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.857
Denied!

01:24:15.274 --> 01:24:17.833
Wet your whistle?

01:24:19.612 --> 01:24:22.914
Where the hell is third squad?
They should've been there by now.

01:24:22.915 --> 01:24:27.818
<i>Hey, Chuck! I just wanna let you know,
third squad took a little detour.</i>

01:24:33.493 --> 01:24:35.961
God damn you, Wilder!

01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.131
Well, what are you doing
just standing there?

01:24:39.132 --> 01:24:42.034
Why don't you pussies get out there
and get me Van Wilder?

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:44.662
- Go!
- Get out there! Move! Move!

01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:54.146
I can't feel my hair anymore, man.

01:24:54.147 --> 01:24:56.581
That means it's working.

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:03.021
I wouldn't go any farther if I were you.

01:25:03.022 --> 01:25:05.820
Yeah, who's gonna stop us? You?

01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:12.624
Exactly.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:30.279
Is that all you've got?

01:26:03.483 --> 01:26:05.851
- I'll go after them, sir.
- No!

01:26:05.852 --> 01:26:07.786
Get me Corporal Benedict.

01:26:07.787 --> 01:26:11.256
We'll take the Humvee
and run right over 'em.

01:26:12.992 --> 01:26:14.993
You're a genius.

01:26:14.994 --> 01:26:17.121
Corporal Benedict.

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:20.091
<i>Corporal Benedict!</i>

01:26:20.833 --> 01:26:24.069
Dirk, have I ever told you
I love you, man?

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.938
We all love you. Yeah!

01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:29.141
<i>- What?
- It's so soft, sir.</i>

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:32.076
Have you felt the helmets?

01:26:33.012 --> 01:26:36.072
Rub your helmet with me, it's so soft.

01:26:36.082 --> 01:26:38.641
You fucking fruitcake!

01:26:41.454 --> 01:26:44.650
- What was that?
- Don't ask, don't tell.

01:26:45.892 --> 01:26:50.328
<i>Okay, Chuck. We got your boys.
Why don't you and little Dirky</i>

01:26:50.329 --> 01:26:51.696
<i>surrender and join the party?</i>

01:26:51.697 --> 01:26:55.633
Never. Surrender? Surrender?

01:26:56.035 --> 01:26:58.628
I'd rather see my uncle naked again.

01:27:05.478 --> 01:27:06.945
It was an accident.

01:27:06.946 --> 01:27:10.711
<i>If you want me, Wilder,
you have to come and get me.</i>

01:27:11.717 --> 01:27:14.082
- Shall we?
- Let's.

01:27:16.289 --> 01:27:20.384
Get out there and stop them! Now! Go!

01:27:20.426 --> 01:27:22.860
He's a little pissant!

01:27:24.397 --> 01:27:25.864
Let me go with you.

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:30.199
Sorry, Dad, but this is one fight
I need to finish on my own.

01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:36.102
- Go get him.
- Let's do it.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:50.544
There's the base!

01:27:56.062 --> 01:27:57.824
Kaitlin.

01:27:58.598 --> 01:28:00.799
I knew you'd come back for me.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.702
What do you say? I go high, you go low?

01:28:03.703 --> 01:28:07.798
No. This asshole's all mine. Go.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.699
- You sure?
- Yep, I got it.

01:28:16.349 --> 01:28:18.783
Come to papa, honeybear.

01:28:22.989 --> 01:28:25.081
You got nothin'.

01:28:28.694 --> 01:28:32.163
- I could do this all day.
- That'd be a first.

01:28:32.164 --> 01:28:36.566
Your hair smells really nice.
What is that, Essence of Traitor?

01:28:44.977 --> 01:28:47.240
- Not so fast.
- Chuck.

01:28:47.713 --> 01:28:49.373
Get up.

01:28:50.883 --> 01:28:52.645
Hot stuff.

01:28:53.719 --> 01:28:55.743
You smell good.

01:28:55.755 --> 01:28:58.985
Wish you fought this hard
in the bedroom.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.363
See, this is why women will never
make it in the military.

01:29:05.364 --> 01:29:08.264
You got nothing between your legs.

01:29:09.402 --> 01:29:10.869
Shit!

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:16.631
Yeah? Well, that makes two of us,
honeybear.

01:29:21.914 --> 01:29:23.581
Nice BB gun.

01:29:23.582 --> 01:29:26.448
I got one just like it at home.

01:29:27.954 --> 01:29:29.154
Maybe not.

01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:31.890
Let me tell you what's wrong
with you Wilders.

01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:36.061
You think you can change the world
just because people like you.

01:29:36.062 --> 01:29:39.898
Well, here's a tip, son,
people are like cockroaches.

01:29:39.899 --> 01:29:43.163
You crush a few, the rest will scatter.

01:29:46.405 --> 01:29:47.871
- I'm sorry, what? I was texting.
- Funny.

01:29:47.872 --> 01:29:49.769
- I'm sorry, what? I was texting.
- Funny.

01:29:50.276 --> 01:29:52.607
But the last laugh is mine.

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.174
God damn dog!

01:30:03.889 --> 01:30:07.415
Like I said, nobody screws my pooch.

01:30:08.894 --> 01:30:10.452
Sit!

01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:12.892
Good boy.

01:30:20.439 --> 01:30:22.566
Orange team wins!

01:30:26.912 --> 01:30:29.481
Wilder, this isn't over.

01:30:29.482 --> 01:30:32.117
And if you think I'm quitting,
you are screwed in the head.

01:30:32.118 --> 01:30:36.855
Hey! Listen up! I am doubling security!

01:30:36.856 --> 01:30:38.656
And I am rewriting the rule book!

01:30:38.657 --> 01:30:42.490
I'm gonna make the old Coolidge
look like Candy Land!

01:30:42.995 --> 01:30:45.296
And you can't stop me.

01:30:45.297 --> 01:30:47.765
No. But he can.

01:30:50.503 --> 01:30:52.637
Thomas, what the hell are you doing?
You can't side with him.

01:30:52.638 --> 01:30:55.774
- He's not one of us.
- You made your bed, soldier.

01:30:55.775 --> 01:30:59.335
Now you're gonna have
to sleep in it. Officer!

01:30:59.612 --> 01:31:01.713
- Get him out of here.
- Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

01:31:01.714 --> 01:31:03.581
Remember who stamps your paycheck.

01:31:03.582 --> 01:31:06.518
- Are you resisting arrest?
- You're damned right I am!

01:31:06.519 --> 01:31:08.316
Thank you.

01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:14.288
This is for putting up with your bullshit.

01:31:14.493 --> 01:31:16.255
And this

01:31:17.563 --> 01:31:20.497
is for denying my kid's admission.

01:31:20.599 --> 01:31:23.761
How affirmative is that action, bitch?

01:31:31.143 --> 01:31:36.147
Corporal, those were about some of the
most outrageous tactics I've ever seen.

01:31:36.148 --> 01:31:38.349
I'll be sure to note that
in my recommendation

01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:40.943
for officer training school.

01:31:45.925 --> 01:31:48.159
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.254
I believe I'll engage in a body shot.

01:31:56.001 --> 01:31:58.136
I'm proud of you, Son.

01:31:58.137 --> 01:31:59.737
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:59.738 --> 01:32:04.174
Van, I'd like you to meet
Stephen Walker, my head of security.

01:32:06.112 --> 01:32:10.742
Mr. Wilder, I'm hereby tendering
my resignation for this assignment.

01:32:10.816 --> 01:32:11.916
Very good.

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:14.652
It's been the utmost pleasure
working with you, sir.

01:32:14.653 --> 01:32:17.522
- Yeah.
- Great work, Steve.

01:32:17.523 --> 01:32:21.151
I'll see you back
at the office, all right? Good.

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:25.526
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:32:26.665 --> 01:32:28.564
Yeah!

01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:31.569
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:35.773
Oh, I think you've proven yourself here.
Wanna come to work with me?

01:32:35.774 --> 01:32:38.943
Actually, I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

01:32:38.944 --> 01:32:41.146
and I've decided to stay in school.

01:32:41.147 --> 01:32:44.048
A smart man once told me that tradition

01:32:44.049 --> 01:32:46.949
is something you just don't break.

01:32:48.621 --> 01:32:50.679
Write that down.

01:32:50.956 --> 01:32:52.718
Let's go.

01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:04.795
- So, you wanna get out of here?
- And miss the party?

01:33:05.604 --> 01:33:07.332
Trust me.

01:33:08.307 --> 01:33:10.434
There'll be more.

01:33:16.248 --> 01:33:19.376
Wait, where's that batti boy, Dirk?

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.890
Sir, I don't mean to alarm you,
but something's about to come up.

01:33:25.891 --> 01:33:28.193
What do you mean, something's about...

01:33:28.194 --> 01:33:30.128
- Stand down, Corporal!
- I can't.

01:33:30.129 --> 01:33:31.857
Stand...

01:33:44.176 --> 01:33:46.911
Remember when I said the best things
in life are worth waiting for?

01:33:46.912 --> 01:33:50.081
- Yeah.
- I think I've waited long enough.

01:33:50.082 --> 01:33:51.674
Van!

01:33:53.285 --> 01:33:56.754
Van, what are you doing? Put that away.

01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:00.451
You're insane. Not here.

01:34:25.784 --> 01:34:27.852
Now, all this stuff

01:34:27.853 --> 01:34:30.288
you've heard about Coolidge
not wanting to party

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:31.789
is a lot of doggy dung.

01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:33.725
- Stand down.
- I can't.

01:34:33.726 --> 01:34:35.921
I'm flanking your ass.

01:34:40.966 --> 01:34:42.400
Do you have any poison?

01:34:42.401 --> 01:34:44.302
- You're tearing it.
- Oh, my God.

01:34:44.303 --> 01:34:46.304
I'm gonna need stitches.

01:34:46.305 --> 01:34:48.606
With some testosterone-pumping,

01:34:48.607 --> 01:34:54.512
pituitary-fucking Neanderthal,
well, then, they are 100...

01:34:54.513 --> 01:34:56.207
Fuck me.

01:34:56.649 --> 01:34:58.946
Fuck, that scared me!

01:34:59.518 --> 01:35:02.350
- Let's fuck!
- That's weird. Okay.

01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:05.589
<i>Take her shirt off, grab the boob.</i>

01:35:10.562 --> 01:35:12.120
<i>Cut!</i>

01:35:14.133 --> 01:35:16.267
It's a challenge to...

01:35:16.268 --> 01:35:19.532
Now, I'm not saying
this is gonna be easy.

01:35:19.571 --> 01:35:23.875
Some of us may fall,
so that all of us may ball.

01:35:23.876 --> 01:35:27.512
Oh, easy there, easy.
Those are big, old colonel balls, honey.

01:35:27.513 --> 01:35:30.208
This a new experience for you?

01:35:30.482 --> 01:35:34.418
Yeah. I usually use my old balls.

01:35:34.653 --> 01:35:37.255
Big old, colonel,
big, round, colonel balls.

01:35:37.256 --> 01:35:42.193
Hey, when I'm off camera,
I'm just gonna show 'em my old balls!

01:35:42.194 --> 01:35:45.891
You gotta admit, though,
this is kind of romantic.

01:35:46.899 --> 01:35:51.301
Hey, watch those teeth.
Or take 'em out before you do anything.

01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:53.995
Who's my big, bad boy?

01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:58.176
- I'm your big, bad boy.
- There you go.

01:35:58.177 --> 01:36:02.013
Oh, God. I haven't been this
uncomfortable since Catholic school.

01:36:02.014 --> 01:36:04.148
"Feel good, yeah?" Feels good.

01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:06.674
That's how you'd say it,
but I say "feels good".

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:12.724
You know my spot, Lieutenant.

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:16.027
Holy shit! That thing pops!

01:36:16.028 --> 01:36:18.062
College is a team.

01:36:18.063 --> 01:36:22.863
It lives, eats, drinks, and if you're lucky,
humps, as a team.

01:36:23.902 --> 01:36:27.071
I love the smell of gasoline
in the morning.

01:36:27.072 --> 01:36:28.940
Yummy, yum, yeah.

01:36:28.941 --> 01:36:30.541
You wanna go back to my house
and eat some yogurt

01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:32.510
<i>and watch Mean Girls?</i>

01:36:32.511 --> 01:36:34.545
<i>Yeah, Mean Girls is all right,
but the guy in it sucks.</i>

01:36:34.546 --> 01:36:35.880
I think he's dreamy.

01:36:35.881 --> 01:36:38.372
He scheduled me for guard duty.

01:36:38.817 --> 01:36:40.318
What?

01:36:40.319 --> 01:36:43.087
So, you wanna go back
to my house, grab a bottle of shiraz

01:36:43.088 --> 01:36:47.358
<i>- and maybe flip on The Hills?
- No. I hate those bitches.</i>

01:36:47.359 --> 01:36:50.828
He knew I was going to dinner
tonight with...

01:36:51.697 --> 01:36:54.232
I think Brody Jenner's your competition
for Jaw Line of the Year.

01:36:54.233 --> 01:36:56.634
I just... I'm gonna jerk off right here.
Pull it out,

01:36:56.635 --> 01:36:58.469
and just jerk off right in front of you.
Is that okay?

01:36:58.470 --> 01:37:01.962
You lick my dick 'cause you like taste.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.374
Turn around, turn around.

01:37:03.375 --> 01:37:05.643
You motherfucker, asshole dick-licker!

01:37:05.644 --> 01:37:07.945
<i>I've got 13 Going on 30.</i>

01:37:07.946 --> 01:37:09.447
I've seen it. I'll watch it again.

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:11.516
- Ruffalo's bomb.
- Yeah, he's awesome in that.

01:37:11.517 --> 01:37:12.884
You asshole dick-licker!

01:37:12.885 --> 01:37:16.582
Could be like this. You and me always.

01:37:17.556 --> 01:37:19.657
What do you say, once we get loose,
we find a little pup tent

01:37:19.658 --> 01:37:21.793
and fuck for a week?

01:37:21.794 --> 01:37:24.262
Robert Levy's not paying me
enough to show my penis.

01:37:24.263 --> 01:37:27.288
- Is that sweat?
- No, that's pre-cum.

01:37:27.366 --> 01:37:30.835
You gotta eat dirt
before you drink champagne.

01:37:30.836 --> 01:37:33.404
Sometimes you have got to stand up
as a man

01:37:33.405 --> 01:37:35.239
before you can lie down with a woman.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.799
You gotta get your guard on
before your hard-on.

01:37:38.544 --> 01:37:41.638
Nothing? You know... Hold on a second.

01:37:42.347 --> 01:37:43.714
Wait. Hold on.

01:37:43.715 --> 01:37:45.716
What do you tell a woman
with two black eyes?

01:37:45.717 --> 01:37:47.514
Nothing. You already told her twice.

01:38:22.287 --> 01:38:24.379
Hand me your gun.

01:38:26.625 --> 01:38:29.958
I can't quit you.
