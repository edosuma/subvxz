Years.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.094
What i'm doing.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.996
And i had just had a baby.

Her name is journi, and she's

04:25.499 --> 04:26.431

Her father is not in her life

04:31.405 --> 04:32.137
At all.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.039

Alone.

>> so walk us through the way

04:36.777 --> 04:39.177

>> just had a baby.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.380
I was on myspace.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.382
We exchanged numbers, and we

04:43.384 --> 04:44.783
Started talking.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.585
Probably, like, a month in,

04:46.587 --> 04:48.020
He sent me his first picture,

04:48.022 --> 04:49.421
And i liked it.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.089
After that, he asked me to be

04:51.091 --> 04:52.124
With him.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.492
>> and you haven't been dating

04:53.494 --> 04:54.693
Anybody else, right?

04:54.695 --> 04:55.527
>> correct.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.862

04:58.198 --> 04:59.598
>> over the last few years,

04:59.600 --> 05:00.899

05:00.901 --> 05:01.667
Video-chat.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.101
>> i asked him to skype me,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.069
And he was like, he got

05:04.071 --> 05:04.903
A raggedy camera.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.138
I was, "okay, whatever."

05:06.140 --> 05:08.140
Like, i'm really, really getting

05:08.142 --> 05:09.107
Fed up.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.776
>> you went as far to move to

05:10.778 --> 05:12.377

05:12.379 --> 05:14.646
Still can't meet up with you.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.014
>> yeah, he was excited.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.115
We talked about a future,

05:17.117 --> 05:18.417
Maybe moving in together.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.651
But when i got there, he just

05:19.653 --> 05:21.353
Keep making excuses on why he

05:21.355 --> 05:22.921
Can't see me, and i don't know

05:22.923 --> 05:24.189
Why.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.924
>> what is it about this guy

05:25.926 --> 05:27.959
That makes you stay with him

05:27.961 --> 05:29.294
After everything that you've

05:29.296 --> 05:29.995
Been through now?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.263
>> he's good to talk to, and he

05:31.265 --> 05:32.464
Can handle me.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.399
Like, when i'm mad, he talks me

05:34.401 --> 05:35.233
Through it, 'cause i have

05:35.235 --> 05:36.601
A very bad attitude.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.337
He talk me through and get me

05:38.339 --> 05:40.205
Out of the little petty stage

05:40.207 --> 05:42.007
That i'm in, which a lot of

05:42.009 --> 05:42.974
People can't.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.243
>> has james expressed interest

05:45.245 --> 05:46.845
In, like, being a dad to

05:46.847 --> 05:47.713
Journi?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.081
>> oh, he don't know i have

05:49.083 --> 05:50.849
A daughter.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.085
He told me he didn't like kids.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.186
>> so you've been keeping

05:54.188 --> 05:56.221

06:02.696 --> 06:03.562
Kids?

>> by the time we caught

06:04.565 --> 06:06.498
Feelings, i was in too deep.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.467

06:08.469 --> 06:09.568
Course i would think he would

06:09.570 --> 06:11.203
Love my daughter once we meet

06:11.205 --> 06:12.270
In person.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.505

In north carolina.

She had to go to foster care.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.749

That sucks.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.019
>> yeah, that's a crazy

08:08.021 --> 08:08.687
Childhood.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.621
And then how'd you end up in

08:09.623 --> 08:10.555
Washington?

08:10.557 --> 08:11.423
>> my mom.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.457
I moved back with her when i was

08:12.459 --> 08:13.458
14.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.359
>> so you grew up in

08:14.361 --> 08:15.193
North carolina?

08:15.195 --> 08:15.861
>> yeah.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.561
>> got it.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.630
>> so you've got this three-year

08:18.632 --> 08:20.365
Love affair with this guy

08:20.367 --> 08:21.066
James...

08:21.068 --> 08:22.033
>> mm.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.301
>> who's giving you the

08:23.303 --> 08:24.169
Runaround.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.304
>> yeah, when i came here, i was

08:26.306 --> 08:27.506
Like, "can we meet up tonight?

08:27.508 --> 08:28.573
I'm free."

08:28.575 --> 08:30.208
He was like, "well, i'm at

08:30.210 --> 08:31.076
Work."

08:31.078 --> 08:32.244
So i waited till the next

08:32.246 --> 08:32.910
Weekend.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.845
I made reservations at

08:33.847 --> 08:34.813
The melting pot.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.746
I was like, "are you gonna

08:35.749 --> 08:36.414
Come?"

08:36.416 --> 08:37.282
He was like, "yeah, i'll be

08:37.284 --> 08:38.116
There."

08:38.118 --> 08:40.452
I got all dressed up, and he

08:40.453 --> 08:41.753
Didn't come.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.856
So i make another plan to come

08:44.858 --> 08:45.957
To him.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.759
I had a friend bring me--aisha.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.827
>> you went together?

08:48.829 --> 08:49.494
>> yes.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.495
>> and you drove, like, an hour.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.396
>> well, it took, like,

08:51.398 --> 08:52.330
45 minutes to get to the

08:52.332 --> 08:53.365
Shell gas station.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.332
He said he'd meet us there,

08:54.334 --> 08:55.400
Take us to the house.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.635
We kept calling and calling.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.736
He didn't pick up.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.803
>> but you love this guy?

08:58.805 --> 08:59.471
>> mm-hmm.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.172
>> why?

09:01.174 --> 09:03.975
>> his personality mostly.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.211
And as i said, he can handle me.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.580
I have lost a good amount of

09:08.582 --> 09:10.081
Friends 'cause of my attitude.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.917
He knows how to calm me down.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.585
>> he's the tiana whisperer.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.686
>> and he's real sweet and

09:14.688 --> 09:15.353
Romantic.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.021
>> yeah?

09:16.023 --> 09:16.955
>> he's more emotional than

09:16.957 --> 09:17.622
I am.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.657
He shares more.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.058
Like, a voice mail he left me

09:20.060 --> 09:21.059
Was really sweet.

09:21.061 --> 09:21.893
>> can we hear it?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.694
>> sure.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.096
>> yeah, let's hear this guy.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.246
>> he's a little hard, but he's

09:41.248 --> 09:42.447
Sensitive underneath it.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.782
>> yeah.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.216
>> what does he look like?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.886
>> i mean, at first, i was all--

09:47.888 --> 09:49.988
It was this cartoon character

09:49.990 --> 09:50.922
As a picture.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.424
>> his profile picture was

09:52.426 --> 09:53.692
An animated, like, cartoon

09:53.694 --> 09:54.359
Drawing?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.327
>> yeah, i'm like, "who is

09:55.329 --> 09:56.094
This?"

09:56.096 --> 09:57.462
So i'm like, "well, can

09:57.464 --> 09:58.463
I at least get a picture?"

09:58.465 --> 09:59.898
So he sends a selfie-type

09:59.900 --> 10:00.765
Picture.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.233
>> so can we see some pictures

10:02.235 --> 10:02.901
Of him?

10:02.903 --> 10:03.635
>> yeah, do you have any

10:03.637 --> 10:04.336
Pictures on your phone?

10:04.338 --> 10:05.637
>> yeah.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.938
>> okay, so here's james.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.872
>> all right.

10:07.874 --> 10:08.673
>> wait. Is that him?

10:08.675 --> 10:09.341
>> yeah.

10:09.343 --> 10:10.108
>> that looks like a picture

10:10.110 --> 10:10.842
From a photo shoot.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.543
You know what i mean?

10:11.545 --> 10:12.510
>> that'd be good if he was

10:12.512 --> 10:13.411
Famous.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.546
>> well, maybe that guy is

10:14.548 --> 10:15.313
Famous.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.615
It may not be the guy you're

10:16.617 --> 10:17.382
Talking to, though.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.550
That's what i'm worried about.

10:18.552 --> 10:19.484
>> oh, god.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.252
>> so, look, listening to you

10:21.254 --> 10:22.220
Talk about everything that's

10:22.222 --> 10:23.722
Gone on in your life, you've

10:23.724 --> 10:25.590
Had a lot of things happen.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.891
Your path has changed.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.593
You had to move, and, like,

10:28.595 --> 10:29.961
Things haven't been very stable

10:29.963 --> 10:31.563
For any long period of time.

10:31.565 --> 10:32.430
>> mm-hmm.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.032
I just hope he's who he say

10:34.034 --> 10:34.799
He is.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.568
Like, when we first said we love

10:36.570 --> 10:38.169
You, that's taking, like,

10:38.171 --> 10:39.738
A piece from my heart, so he has

10:39.740 --> 10:42.007
That piece of a heart from me

10:42.009 --> 10:44.075
That i can't just get back that

10:44.077 --> 10:44.909
Easy.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.244
'cause it's been three years--

10:46.246 --> 10:48.113
That's so long if he not who he

10:48.115 --> 10:48.780
Is.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.248
It would be great if he is.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.317
And i just hope that he will be

10:52.319 --> 10:53.685
Okay with my daughter, accepting

10:53.687 --> 10:54.653
My daughter.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.754
>> well, yeah, because you're in

10:55.756 --> 10:56.621
A weird position.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.989
Yeah, 'cause if it does turn out

10:57.991 --> 11:00.191
To be james and there's a chance

11:00.193 --> 11:01.292
This could work out, then you've

11:01.294 --> 11:02.127
Got a big problem...

11:02.129 --> 11:02.861
>> yeah.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.762
>> which is that you've been

11:03.764 --> 11:04.596
Lying to him.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.398
>> yeah, but maybe i can change

11:06.400 --> 11:07.065
That.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.233
>> we'll see what we can dig up

11:08.235 --> 11:09.934
On james, and we'll report back

11:09.936 --> 11:10.602
To you.

11:10.604 --> 11:11.603
>> hopefully it can be a love

11:11.605 --> 11:13.638
Story at the end.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.808
>> well, we'll find out.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.243
Okay.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.844
>> all right, max.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.879
No, yeah.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.824
For us.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.326
What is this james guy up to?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.062
Why can't he be available?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.063
>> what is he getting out of

11:38.065 --> 11:38.730
This?

11:38.732 --> 11:40.098
>> whatever this guy's hiding,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.534
It's gonna be big.

>> yeah.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.677
Is that banana nut?

11:52.679 --> 11:53.845
Does that have nuts in it?

11:53.847 --> 11:54.546
>> it does.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.213
>> ah.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.114
>> did you just really ask if it

11:56.116 --> 11:56.781
Has nuts in it?

11:56.783 --> 11:57.449
>> yeah.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.017
Do you have a banana non-nut?

>> i have a banana.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.786

12:03.123 --> 12:04.622
>> all right, what we're dealing

12:04.624 --> 12:06.558
With here is, like, a classic

Catfish.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.127
Tiana gets a myspace message,

Previously lived.

They start talking.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.202
>> she doesn't mention that

12:17.204 --> 12:18.002
She's got a kid.

12:18.004 --> 12:18.670
>> that's right.

12:18.672 --> 12:19.571

12:19.573 --> 12:20.138
Kids."

12:20.140 --> 12:21.239
>> i almost suspect that maybe

12:21.241 --> 12:22.474
He has a kid.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.475
>> he might have a kid.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.142
>> right.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.844
>> she moves from washington

12:25.846 --> 12:28.680
State to north carolina to be

12:28.682 --> 12:29.547
Close to him.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.015
She's now been in north carolina

12:31.017 --> 12:32.117
For five months.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.618
Now every time they talk about

12:33.620 --> 12:35.487
Meeting up, he's got an excuse.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.355
>> she's not willing to let go

12:37.357 --> 12:38.790
And move on because this is

12:38.792 --> 12:39.924
Her first love.

12:39.926 --> 12:40.859
>> let's open the box.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.160
>> let's crack this wide open.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.661
All right, here we go, tiana--

12:47.968 --> 12:49.834
>> oh, there's six photos.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.202
>> let's run the photos.

That's in north carolina.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.453

13:08.455 --> 13:10.155
We got some person here who's

13:10.157 --> 13:11.256

13:11.258 --> 13:13.191
Using that photograph tiana's

13:27.507 --> 13:28.706
>> but let's just go back and

13:28.708 --> 13:29.541
Look through more of these

13:29.543 --> 13:30.408
Videos and see if there's any

13:30.410 --> 13:30.975
Actual--

13:30.977 --> 13:31.676
Here we go, look.

13:37.117 --> 13:37.816
Some [bleep].

13:37.818 --> 13:38.716
>> well, time-out.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.185
First of all, this guy's got

13:40.187 --> 13:40.952
A youtube account.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.253
Second of all, he clearly has

13:42.255 --> 13:43.321
A computer with a web cam.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.489
>> yeah, true.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.391
>> we can show her the video of

13:46.393 --> 13:48.326
Him talking on youtube, and

13:48.328 --> 13:49.727
She'll know right away if that's

13:49.729 --> 13:51.095
His voice or not.

13:51.097 --> 13:51.996
>> well, it looks like we

13:51.998 --> 13:53.231
Found this guy.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.199
>> well, we found the guy

13:54.201 --> 13:54.866
From the pictures.

13:54.868 --> 13:55.633
>> right.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.802
If james were a well-known

13:57.804 --> 13:58.570
Recording artist...

13:58.572 --> 13:59.337
>> he would have said that.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.171
>> he would have told her that.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.806
>> unless he didn't want her to

14:01.808 --> 14:03.074
Know because he's married or

14:03.076 --> 14:03.875
Something.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.109
What if this is the one episode

14:05.111 --> 14:07.846
Where the rapper is pretending

14:07.848 --> 14:10.748
To be the mechanic instead of

14:10.750 --> 14:12.584
The mechanic pretending to be

14:12.586 --> 14:13.384
A rapper?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.452
>> wow.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.887
>> what's this guy's real name?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.689
That's what we need to find out.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.656
>> all right, let's see if he's

14:18.658 --> 14:19.424
On facebook.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.491
There it is, yeah.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.360
Gregory johnson...

14:22.362 --> 14:23.094
>> whoa!

14:23.096 --> 14:25.496
>> aka klassified tipsytwist.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.464
>> so we got his name.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.699
>> the same guy in the pictures

14:27.701 --> 14:29.467
That tiana's been getting from

14:29.469 --> 14:31.035
James, except there's a lot more

14:31.037 --> 14:31.936
Pictures.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.172
All right, well, this is not

14:34.174 --> 14:35.306
Good news for tiana.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.040
All right, so that's

14:36.042 --> 14:36.708
Interesting.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.709
Let's come back to that.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.410
Let's look up james sloan on

14:39.412 --> 14:40.078
Facebook.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.212
He says he doesn't have

14:41.214 --> 14:42.080
A facebook.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.449
"james sloan," maybe "nc" just

14:44.451 --> 14:46.484
To narrow it down a little bit.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.853
>> oh, james sloan, charlotte.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.054
There are a bunch of

14:50.056 --> 14:51.389
James sloans in north carolina.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.757
Look, a cartoon thumbnail

14:52.759 --> 14:53.424
Avatar.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.259
>> with a donald duck,

14:54.261 --> 14:55.593
Like, grumpy donald duck.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.162
>> she said that on myspace, he

14:58.164 --> 15:00.031
Had a cartoon thumbnail.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.532
>> yes, you're right.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.034
>> we found a james sloan with

15:03.036 --> 15:04.402
A cartoon thumbnail.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.470
Look, there's a car.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.271
He's into cars.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.138
He's a mechanic.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.339
He's a self-employed mechanic.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.707
>> oh, my god.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.110
>> is that him?

15:12.112 --> 15:12.777
Whoa.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.012
Wait a minute.

15:14.014 --> 15:14.913
>> is that him?

15:14.915 --> 15:15.813
>> is that him?

15:15.815 --> 15:16.581
>> that's his profile --

15:16.583 --> 15:17.181
>> and older.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.249
>> that's his profile picture.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.117
>> whoa.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.152
That's something big to hide.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.287
He's a mechanic.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.455
He has a cartoon thumbnail.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.857
Oh, man, and he's been talking

15:25.859 --> 15:28.026
To this 21-year-old girl.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.861
Finally, we found the

15:29.863 --> 15:32.730
50-year-old, like, pervert guy.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.700
That guy is, like, the picture

15:35.702 --> 15:37.468
Of who you fear you're talking

15:37.470 --> 15:39.003
To when you're talking to

15:39.005 --> 15:40.171
A stranger on the internet and

15:40.173 --> 15:41.139
You think they're someone.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.340
>> yeah, the really sad thing to

15:42.342 --> 15:44.409
Think about is that if that's

15:44.411 --> 15:46.511
What he's hiding, then it makes

15:46.513 --> 15:47.745
A lot of sense...

15:47.747 --> 15:48.780
>> that's a pretty big deal.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.681
>> that he wouldn't want to meet

15:49.683 --> 15:50.481
Up with her and that he would

15:50.483 --> 15:51.749
Make excuses to avoid.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.084
I mean, like, there's, "i'm not

15:53.086 --> 15:53.952
The guy in the pictures,"

15:53.954 --> 15:55.086
And then there's like, "i'm not

15:55.088 --> 15:56.621
The guy, the race, the age,

15:56.623 --> 15:59.090
Even close to or anything like

15:59.092 --> 16:00.291
That guy in the pictures."

16:00.293 --> 16:01.759
I mean, if this turns out to be

16:01.761 --> 16:03.494
Our guy, we're dealing with

16:03.496 --> 16:05.697
A serious disaster.

16:09.134 --> 16:09.801
>> you ready?

16:09.803 --> 16:10.702
You ready to get a workout?

16:10.704 --> 16:13.338
>> hey.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.592
>> are they good friends?

16:34.594 --> 16:35.426
>> both: Yeah.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.494
>> so how do you guys know each

16:36.496 --> 16:37.261
Other?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.330
>> we met through facebook.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.798
We've been friends four years

16:40.800 --> 16:41.466
And change.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.133
>> yeah.

16:42.135 --> 16:42.934
>> are you in a relationship?

16:42.936 --> 16:44.502
>> yeah, you can say that.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.903
>> is this the guy that is the

16:45.905 --> 16:47.972
Dad of the kids?

16:47.974 --> 16:49.140
>> yeah, i have four kids,

16:49.142 --> 16:50.908
So he helps me out with all of

16:50.910 --> 16:51.609
My kids.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.510
>> and what do you think about

16:52.512 --> 16:53.177
James?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.013
>> mm, it shouldn't take all

16:55.015 --> 16:56.347
This for them to see each other.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.915
There's been times where, you

16:57.917 --> 16:59.550
Know, we've been out and she

16:59.552 --> 17:00.485
Would call him and tell him, you

17:00.487 --> 17:01.352
Know, "meet us here."

17:01.354 --> 17:02.420
He would never show up.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.721
>> you guys were on that trip

17:03.723 --> 17:04.521
Together, you drove together.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.423
>> yeah, that's the one with all

17:05.425 --> 17:06.257
Her gas money.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.558
>> yeah, it was my car.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.760
Somebody owe me some gas money,

17:08.762 --> 17:09.827
'cause he just kind of stood us

17:09.829 --> 17:10.494
Up.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.496
It's like, he ain't answering

17:11.498 --> 17:12.163
The phone.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.164
He never showed up.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.165
Me, personally, i don't think

17:15.167 --> 17:16.666
I would have, you know, let it

17:16.669 --> 17:17.801
Go this far.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.002
>> three years.

17:19.005 --> 17:19.670
>> yeah.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.338
I'm sorry.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.204
>> you know, you always got that

17:21.207 --> 17:23.074
One friend that's like, "why are

17:23.076 --> 17:23.974
You doing it?"

17:23.977 --> 17:25.710
And you know how my attitude

17:25.712 --> 17:27.377
Is--i really don't care what

17:27.380 --> 17:28.046
Nobody say.

17:28.048 --> 17:28.746
>> yeah.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.647
>> i'm still gonna talk to him.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.581
>> i mean, that's what's up.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.516
Do you, boo.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.651
>> have you told her that james

17:33.653 --> 17:35.086
Doesn't like kids?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.821
>> he don't?

17:36.823 --> 17:37.922
>> yeah, i told you he didn't

17:37.924 --> 17:38.923
Know i had a daughter.

17:38.925 --> 17:39.857
>> i know that he don't know

17:39.859 --> 17:41.192
About journi, but he don't even

17:41.194 --> 17:42.226
Like kids?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.896
That's gonna be awkward.

17:44.898 --> 17:45.830
[laughter]

17:45.832 --> 17:47.065
>> well, so, look...

17:47.067 --> 17:48.866
You know probably as well as

17:48.868 --> 17:50.401
Anybody what tiana's been going

17:50.403 --> 17:51.235
Through with this guy.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.270
What i'd like to do is sort of

17:52.272 --> 17:53.805
Go over everything that we

17:53.807 --> 17:55.006
Found.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.340
So first thing we did was

17:56.342 --> 17:59.043
A search for these six pictures,

17:59.045 --> 18:00.978
And it came back with a hit on

18:00.980 --> 18:02.046
A youtube video.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.347
So we went to that video.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.983
We found that little picture.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.386
And the username is tipsytwist.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.887
>> do you know tipsytwist?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.856
Does that say anything to you?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.024
>> no, i never heard of that

18:13.026 --> 18:13.825
Name.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.726
>> this guy's, like, a legit

18:15.728 --> 18:17.328
Hip-hop artist.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.629
James never talked about making

18:18.631 --> 18:19.630
Music, right?

18:19.632 --> 18:20.731
>> no.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.899
Have you tried looking that name

18:21.901 --> 18:22.733
Up on facebook?

18:22.735 --> 18:23.568
>> so that was the next thing we

18:23.570 --> 18:24.235
Did.

18:24.237 --> 18:24.902
>> wow.

18:24.904 --> 18:25.736
>> we found this page.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.604
>> that's him.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.272
That's the guy from the pictures

18:28.274 --> 18:28.973
You got.

18:28.975 --> 18:29.640
>> wow.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.675
>> this is a music page,

18:30.677 --> 18:31.709
Like, you know, for

18:31.711 --> 18:33.211
A band/musician.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.445
And when we click on his profile

18:34.447 --> 18:35.880
Pictures, there's a bunch of

18:35.882 --> 18:36.814
Photos.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.082
>> wow.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.051
>> we did a search for

18:40.053 --> 18:41.052
Tipsytwist.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.520
And so there's a video of this

18:42.522 --> 18:43.187
Guy.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.155
We thought if we play this video

18:44.157 --> 18:45.456
For you, maybe you'll be able to

18:45.458 --> 18:46.591
Tell if it's the same voice that

18:46.593 --> 18:47.458
You've been talking to on

18:47.460 --> 18:48.226
The phone for the last three

18:48.228 --> 18:48.893
Years.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.560
>> okay.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.661
>> keep y'all updated on some

18:50.663 --> 18:51.662
Of the [bleep] that's going on

18:51.664 --> 18:53.865
And [bleep].

18:53.867 --> 18:54.699
You know what i'm saying?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.300
'cause the label's been down

18:56.302 --> 18:57.368
For, like, about a month or two.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.170
>> does it sound like him?

18:59.172 --> 19:00.671
>> life takes you on...

19:00.673 --> 19:02.406
>> it doesn't sound like him.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.074
>> no?

19:03.076 --> 19:03.908
>> his voice is way deeper than

19:03.910 --> 19:04.642
That.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.943
>> there was more research to

19:05.945 --> 19:08.112
Do, so we kept looking.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.413
So then we thought, "okay, let's

19:09.415 --> 19:10.281
Just look him up on facebook."

19:10.283 --> 19:11.215
I mean, i know you said he

19:11.217 --> 19:12.216
Didn't have a facebook page.

19:12.218 --> 19:12.884
>> mm-hmm.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.385
>> but there is a james sloan

19:14.387 --> 19:16.053
From north carolina that showed

19:16.055 --> 19:16.721
Up.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.356
We saw this guy had a cartoon

19:18.358 --> 19:20.958
Character for his picture.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.727
>> mm-hmm, the same with

19:22.729 --> 19:23.561
Myspace.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.729
>> that was the same one?

19:24.731 --> 19:25.630
>> no, it's not the same one,

19:25.632 --> 19:26.297
But--

19:26.299 --> 19:27.431
>> what was the cartoon?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.399
>> it was daffy duck.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.233

19:30.770 --> 19:31.435

19:32.405 --> 19:33.371

19:33.373 --> 19:34.472
>> yeah, it was a happy duck.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.606

19:35.608 --> 19:36.841
The way it's shocking me.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.675
>> so is that a duck?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.643
Looks like a bird.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.877
>> dude, that's a duck.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.113
>> that's a duck.
