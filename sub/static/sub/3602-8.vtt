What about the program
in your dad's computer?

00:13.639 --> 00:15.379
Didn't you say
it cracked some code?

00:15.474 --> 00:17.510

the sequencing method

00:17.602 --> 00:20.264

specific DNA markers.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.515

it's gibberish.

to my wife's funeral.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.089
All I wanted was
to be left alone.

a few more questions.

14:50.474 --> 14:53.386
Can't you get
your partner here to
look inside my head?

We need to have it
on the record. You burnt
that doctor to the bone,

14:57.647 --> 14:59.729

your wife cancer.

take you away, and
nobody'll listen to you.

You've seen

15:49.533 --> 15:52.775
Okay? Something is
happening to me, too!

15:52.869 --> 15:56.236
Ted, l was able
to read your wife's
dying thoughts.

Do you know what doctors
do in the United States?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.209
They drive taxi cabs.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.336
You and father
were talking
before he left,

27:12.423 --> 27:14.539

you persuaded him
to go.

if it was true.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.725
Your father and I
were married
for 33 years.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.177
That is not an answer.
Yes, it is.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.556
A marriage doesn't
last that long

27:28.648 --> 27:31.640
without allowing
the other person to
be who he has to be.

27:31.734 --> 27:35.568
How could you allow him
to abandon everything,
just like that?

I'm afraid that answer
is not as easy.

that I could never
take the place of her.

I know this?

too painful
to talk about,

for your father.

He was afraid that you

the one you've
painted here,

28:57.862 --> 28:59.818
and here, and there,

29:02.074 --> 29:03.780
she's my daughter.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.033
My Claire.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.905
This man here
goes by the name of Sylar.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.999
He's going to kill her
tomorrow night at her
homecoming game.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.326
VVhy?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.582
Because she's special,
like you.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.753
And that makes her
a target.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.335
Like me.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.382
You're not the only one
with special abilities,
Isaac.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.553
There are others.
Sylar is killing them,

29:25.640 --> 29:27.221
one at a time.

29:27.934 --> 29:28.923
(EXHALES)

29:29.352 --> 29:31.434
If you know who he is,
then why can't you
stop him?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.101
Because nobody knows
where he is.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.850
I need your help.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.557
I need you to
paint this painting.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.981
I'm sorry.
I've been trying.
I can't.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.695
Not without
the drugs.

29:45.201 --> 29:46.190
Fine.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.707
I promise,
we will help you
use your abilities,

29:58.923 --> 29:59.958
without this,

30:00.049 --> 30:02.631
but right now
there just isn't time.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.299
I'm fighting
to get my life back,

30:04.387 --> 30:05.968
and you want me to
just throw it away.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.933
You know,

30:15.398 --> 30:16.979
for many years now,
a number of us have been

30:17.942 --> 30:20.228
tracking, locating,
monitoring

30:20.319 --> 30:21.308
people like you.

30:21.404 --> 30:24.146
Sometimes the process
goes smoothly,
as in your case,

30:24.240 --> 30:25.446
but other times...

30:25.741 --> 30:27.697
Well, let'sjust say
some people misinterpret
our motives,

30:27.785 --> 30:30.071
and then it can go
very wrong.

30:31.956 --> 30:35.073
Fourteen years ago,
there was just such a case,

30:36.085 --> 30:38.076
which, sadly,
ended in a death.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.211
Well, one left behind
a baby girl

30:41.298 --> 30:43.129
who had no one
to take care of her.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.342
My wife and I
had been having
a hard time

30:47.805 --> 30:50.512
conceiving a child of our own
at the time, and...

30:53.019 --> 30:54.475
And it was like

30:55.980 --> 30:58.972
(VOICE BREAKING)
God had reached down
and given us a miracle.

31:01.610 --> 31:02.599
Isaac,

31:04.989 --> 31:07.605
this is my daughter
we're talking about.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.151
I'm begging you.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.128
Let me try
one more time,

31:20.546 --> 31:21.581
without them.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.848
(COMPUTER RUNNING)

31:35.603 --> 31:38.310
(KEYBOARD CLICKING)

31:38.814 --> 31:39.929
Who are you?

31:44.236 --> 31:45.646
What are you doing here?

31:50.159 --> 31:52.696
Hey, wait!
Stop! Come back here.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.706
DISPA TCHER: / got a pickup
at 1500 Broadway to JFK.

32:08.719 --> 32:09.834
No!

32:11.180 --> 32:12.169
Father!

32:13.015 --> 32:14.255
Father!
Help!

32:16.644 --> 32:17.633
Father!

32:18.771 --> 32:20.011
Father!

32:23.359 --> 32:24.348
Stop!

32:26.695 --> 32:28.401
Stop. Stop. Stop.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.126
Dad!

33:35.598 --> 33:36.587
Claire?

33:37.308 --> 33:38.343
Honey? Is everything
all right?

33:38.434 --> 33:39.389
Yeah,
everything's fine.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.091
Can't a girl
just visit her dad
at work?

33:41.187 --> 33:43.098
You never
visit me
at work.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.731
Okay, I'm busted.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.022
l have an emergency.
A paper emergency.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.474
A paper emergency!
A paper emergency!

33:48.569 --> 33:51.436
Miss Roberts says
we need a banner
over the trophy case,

33:51.530 --> 33:52.565
and Jackie was all,

33:52.656 --> 33:53.941
"We don't have
paper that big!

33:54.033 --> 33:55.273
"They don't make
paper that big!"

33:55.367 --> 33:58.234
So I thought I'd stop by
and try to be a hero.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.570
(SIGHS
DRAMATICALLY)

34:01.332 --> 34:02.572
Well, if it'll
make you a hero

34:02.666 --> 34:04.452
and maybe
knock Jackie down
a few notches,

34:04.543 --> 34:06.204
we might be able
to find something
that'll work.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.123
Best dad ever.

34:11.759 --> 34:15.172
I'm sorry, Mr. Bennet,
we just have
a little situation.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.180
You know what?
The sample room is right
down there, Claire Bear.

34:20.267 --> 34:21.427
You take anything
you need.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.221
Okay?
Thanks, Dad.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.144
First door
on your left.

34:27.942 --> 34:29.478
I'm sorry,
I didn't know
she'd be here.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.770
So what's
the problem?

34:31.153 --> 34:32.814
It's not working.
He can't do it.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.819
He tried, he's just
not there yet.

34:37.952 --> 34:39.817
We tried his way,
now we do it mine.

34:40.162 --> 34:41.743
He has worked so
hard to get clean.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.161
You can't ask him
to do this.

34:43.249 --> 34:44.864
I'm not going to ask him.

34:46.877 --> 34:47.992
You are.

34:49.004 --> 34:49.993
No!

34:50.172 --> 34:51.628
No, you can't
make me do that.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.335
You knew this was
a possibility.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.630
You said when we started
that I would never have
to do it again.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.756
You promised me.
I know what you think.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.132
Who do you think
taughtyou?

35:00.683 --> 35:03.550
Do you even remember
what you were
when I found you?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.685
You're the easy way.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.529
I think we both know
the hard way.

35:36.010 --> 35:39.719
(INAUDIBLE)

36:11.253 --> 36:12.493
Did she say
anything?

36:12.588 --> 36:14.579
Sounded like
she was scared?

36:15.799 --> 36:16.788
No.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.176
She seemed
very nice.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.249
She was.

36:20.596 --> 36:24.930
Too nice to die like that,
head ripped open.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.426
I ain't never seen
anything like it.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.268
We're very sorry.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.354
Y'all stick around.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.602
Need to take
your statements.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.144
Oh, is that Ensenada?
Mmm.

38:49.578 --> 38:54.288
Pam Balton called
to ask me why you
punched Tom McHenry.

38:55.209 --> 38:56.415
I told her you didn't.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.700
Did you?

38:59.755 --> 39:00.744
Yeah.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.625
Yeah, I punched him.
He knows.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.174
Damn it, / knew it.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.050
You punched
a superior officer.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.097
That has to have
some kind of repercussions.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.769
He may out rank me, but
"superior" is taking it
a little too far.

39:17.940 --> 39:20.272
I got one month's
suspension, no pay.

39:20.442 --> 39:21.807
Jesus, Matt.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.494
Something happened
between me and Tom.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.285
(SCOFFS)

39:42.798 --> 39:44.334
You slept with him.

39:45.092 --> 39:46.081
(WHISPERING) Yes.

39:59.356 --> 40:00.345
Is it over?

40:00.983 --> 40:01.972
Yes.

40:05.612 --> 40:06.601
Are we?

40:09.700 --> 40:10.815
(WHISPERING)
I don't know.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.696
(PHONE RINGING)

40:22.004 --> 40:22.993
Yeah, it's Matt.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.327
He's gone!

40:24.548 --> 40:25.754
What?
Ted!

40:25.841 --> 40:28.253
He escaped.
MAN: Watch out!

40:29.970 --> 40:31.335
Do you hear me?

40:31.638 --> 40:33.924
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard you.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.178
MAN: Hurry up!

41:43.418 --> 41:44.828
MOHINDER: You can run far,

41:44.920 --> 41:47.036
you can take
your small precautions,

41:47.923 --> 41:50.539
but have you really
gotten away?

41:51.718 --> 41:54.300
Can you ever escape?

42:04.189 --> 42:07.352
Or is the truth
that you do not have
the strength or cunning

42:07.442 --> 42:08.943
to hide from destiny?

42:11.947 --> 42:12.936
What?

42:15.784 --> 42:17.024
Nothing.

42:17.119 --> 42:18.359
(SCOFFS)

42:20.622 --> 42:22.453
But the world is not small.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.448
You are.

42:42.144 --> 42:43.350
And fate

42:43.478 --> 42:45.685
can find you anywhere.
