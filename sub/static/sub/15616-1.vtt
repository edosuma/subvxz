03:15.862 --> 03:18.030
Come on, come on, come on.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.749
Shit!

04:08.289 --> 04:10.958
Don't look at me. This
guy's the one who shot you!

04:11.042 --> 04:11.833
Hey!

05:05.847 --> 05:07.055
Six men.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.640
Ten grand a head. Sixty thousand.

05:11.060 --> 05:15.480
Wherever my daughter's spirit
is, I hope she's a little happier.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.401
I thought I would feel better, but--

05:19.485 --> 05:21.194
somehow--

05:24.657 --> 05:26.533
That's my little girl.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.118
They turned her into an addict.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.997
I saw her body and it was hard to recognize.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.166
I keep thinking she's still alive.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.758
♫ Let's go Put some sake In my cup ♫

05:42.842 --> 05:44.593
♫ Fill it up Fill it up ♫

05:44.719 --> 05:48.597
♫ Put some sake in my cup Fill it up Fill it up ♫

06:15.541 --> 06:17.751
You deserve to lose.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.461
Watching me instead of looking

06:19.545 --> 06:22.089
at all that beautiful Siamese kitty cat out there.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.965
Boss, problem with the check.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.995
English! Why you running?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.789
'Cause I know why you're here.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.504
I just need a favor.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.971
Wait! Just hear me out.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.055
Forget it.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.172
Oh, no. Not now!

08:00.605 --> 08:01.980
Hey!

08:08.321 --> 08:09.571
Get off my car.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.452
Moron! You want it?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.333
Look, I have a gun.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.543
You'd already be dead if I was here to kill you.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.545
You want to ask me questions first.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.839
Hey! Hey!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.508
How do you even think that shit about me?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.053
They always send--

08:33.136 --> 08:34.304
someone you know.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.474
I'm on a job here. And you're not it.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.392
I just need some weapons.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.979
Why didn't you say so?

08:43.063 --> 08:48.276
Oh, for Christ's sake. You know, this is Versace.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.445
It's not a knockoff, either.

08:50.530 --> 08:55.033
Do you know what it is to get Versace into Thailand?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.452
Is that my button?

08:59.038 --> 09:02.499
I think all them titties are going to your head.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.125
What could you possibly know that would bring

09:04.210 --> 09:05.710
that kind of heat from the agency?

09:05.795 --> 09:09.548
You know that I was deep cover.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.926
I was too deep for them to take responsibility

09:13.010 --> 09:15.470
once it was blown to fucks!

09:15.555 --> 09:17.138
So what about you?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.141
If you're not here for me, then what's the job?

09:20.226 --> 09:23.645
Are you working for the agency
or are you moonlighting?

09:23.729 --> 09:26.064
A guy lost his daughter to a few punks.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.148
They put her to work.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.067
Bullshit.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.486
What would have you slumming
in with the likes of that?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.655
He's paying the rate.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.448
Okay, fine. Here.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.994
Oh, fuck! I fucking knew it.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.371
Here.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.666
Okay. Maybe I was mistaken.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.878
You know, I've been a bit tense lately.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.172
I don't know what came over me.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.174
Here. We're tight.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.676
No. You hold onto it.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.971
No, no. Never carry a gun.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.681
People get shot that way.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.641
Good point coming from you.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.018
Precisely.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.104
You sure living here's been good for you? Huh?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.106
It's paradise.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.297
Whoa. Who's that?

10:32.381 --> 10:35.175
Relax. Only guy I can trust.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.979
I've got to do something with my hair.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.197
This is where the magic happens.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.169
Right this way. Welcome...

11:11.253 --> 11:13.630
to my little slice of heaven.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.507
Oh, this might become handy.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.008
No, no! Sorry, sorry.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.219
Wrong section. Not for rent.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.388
Not just any M76.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.890
That was used by Lee Marvin in Prime Cut.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.392
He shot Gene Hackman with it

11:25.476 --> 11:27.644
and I've got the papers to prove it.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.772
I'm starting my own Planet Hollywood
here. But all guns.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.649
It's genius. Right?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.609
You ever hear of Pretty Boy Floyd?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.112
Not the bank robber. The movie.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.281
This is the first piece I grabbed.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.911
This M 1 was used by Clint himself in Pink Cadillac.

11:44.995 --> 11:48.081
Grease gun. Charlie Bronson. Dirty Dozen.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.750
I know, it's a franchise, right.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.960
I'm going legit.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.379
All I need is a name.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.631
I was thinking, you know, Café AK.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.718
Or Guns Zone. Like Fun Zone.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.179
But Gun Zone. Uh huh?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.557
Well, I need something long. Working from a distance.

12:05.641 --> 12:09.477
Accuracy international. Real light.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.398
That'll do you. It's a thousand a day.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.191
That's the buddy rate.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.741
You got a suppressor for this?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.159
No. Not for that.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.869
What about a scope, 30 times?

12:25.953 --> 12:29.622
You trying to hit something in Cambodia? Uh, 15.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.586
Best I can do. But I'll throw in night vision.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.017
How much for this?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.560
You golf?

12:50.644 --> 12:55.106
You know, even if you find this guy's daughter

12:55.191 --> 12:59.444
they make them all addicts so they won't leave.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.695
And it's one needle for everybody.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.531
I already found her.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.494
Whoa. Feel that?

13:07.578 --> 13:10.914
Fucking chill just went through me.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.127
So, where you staying?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.129
Wouldn't you like to know.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.508
Gotta be careful. This whole city's haunted.

13:21.592 --> 13:25.136
There's a lot of unhappy spirits looking for you.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.888
There's gonna be a lot more.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.126
Initiation of a monk.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.256
What are you doing here?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.008
I tried to follow you.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.051
Why?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.678
I don't know yet.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.180
Are you alone?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.682
Yes. I couldn't keep up with you.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.393
Then I followed the sound of the chanting.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.937
And you were here.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.191
It's not a coincidence.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.943
It was meant to be that I find you.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.029
You shouldn't have followed me.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.657
It's okay. It's okay.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.242
Do it. Do it.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.545
I won't leave.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.214
I've seen your tracks.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.758
Know you'll be trying soon enough.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.139
Open your mouth.

16:58.976 --> 17:03.062
Heroin withdrawal. It'll pass.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.772
Please let me go.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.316
I need to go back.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.693
I'll do whatever you want.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.779
I will love you. I will.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.663
You'll feel better when it's over.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.796
Come here. Time to get up.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.814
Good?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.443
There's water there for you to clean up.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.945
Here.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.088
You will kill me for following you?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.507
No. For knowing where I'm staying.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.926
Why is it important you stay here?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.101
Why didn't you do it?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.353
Because you said it was okay.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.940
It is.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.277
Nothing's ever that bad to want to give up on life.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.279
I didn't see it as an escape.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.824
It was all right for other reasons. Jai yen.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.535
I'm comfortable with whatever comes.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.704
The settlement for past wrongs.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.456
Then why not just stay there and settle up

20:08.540 --> 20:09.957
instead of following me?

20:10.042 --> 20:13.127
You were sent because my time there was finished.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.838
Shh. Come here.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.186
Now you stay there and be quiet.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.648
My name is Mae. What is yours?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.905
I have to get some sleep.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.115
You're gonna watch that club down there

20:43.200 --> 20:44.659
for the guys who had you.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.286
That is not their club.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.872
I know. But they'll be showing up there anyway.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.332
Because you made it look like

20:51.416 --> 20:53.334
one of the guys from the club just attacked them.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.300
Wake me up when you see somebody you know.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.636
I can't help you kill anyone.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.429
You will.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.223
Why do you kill them?

21:07.307 --> 21:09.642
Why do you think?

21:09.726 --> 21:11.936
Because they're hurting people.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.761
Don't! You have to stop.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.471
This is wrong!

21:55.063 --> 21:56.105
Shhh!

21:59.735 --> 22:00.818
Shut up!

23:17.437 --> 23:19.063
Thanks for the help.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.793
I need to know the other places

24:22.878 --> 24:24.462
where they take you girls.

24:30.010 --> 24:34.346
I don't understand why you won't help me.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.057
It is always wrong to kill.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.893
It is possible the people you shoot

24:38.977 --> 24:40.478
might become better people.

24:43.190 --> 24:47.943
Maybe I can persuade you.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.820
No! It is forbidden.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.241
If killing is always wrong

24:54.326 --> 24:56.076
then I get the same points against me

24:56.161 --> 24:57.369
for a holy man as a pimp.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.787
The only choice you have here is

24:58.872 --> 25:00.372
whether you will be part of getting him killed

25:00.457 --> 25:03.209
or the guys who had you.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.794
Okay. I will take you to them.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.633
If you won't tell me your name

25:10.717 --> 25:13.093
please tell me the month and day of your birth.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.555
Your luck today may depend on it.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.557
You can wear colors which may help.

25:18.642 --> 25:22.019
That's not the kind of help I'm looking for.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.771
I make my own luck.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.362
Why do you talk like a monk?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.155
A long time ago, I joined them.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.281
To escape those pimps?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.159
No, my father sold me.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.330
This is it.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.627
Why would they bring anyone here?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.629
To get rid of them.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.173
There's one right there.

25:52.509 --> 25:57.429
May Ying. She loved to sing.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.598
You misunderstood me.

25:59.683 --> 26:04.645
I want to know where else they
had you working. Working.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.610
This is one place.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.820
Wow.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.282
You look troubled.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.742
Well, I didn't think there'd be as many.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.996
Or this organized.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.500
So will we stop this and leave?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.295
You're gonna have to tell me everything you know.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.798
Eleven more? Seems like a lot.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.341
I will take your word for it.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.926
M ust be all of them.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.930
What are you doing?

26:40.015 --> 26:41.849
Chang Kao.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.892
Oh, my God.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.686
Do they know who you are?

26:45.770 --> 26:48.314
If they find out, they're gonna kill me.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.941
Hey, listen, I'm sorry to have involved you in this.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.277
But we can walk away from this, right?

26:53.361 --> 26:56.196
Maybe they don't know who you are.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.657
I won't say anything if they come to me.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.576
I'll just keep going.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.870
I don't want you to. I'm out.

27:02.954 --> 27:07.583
The deal was all of them. You're out when it's done!

27:08.960 --> 27:11.545
Put some ice on that shit.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.921
You hear me? I'm out!

27:14.549 --> 27:15.883
Hi.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.218
I told you to wait downstairs. Come on.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.512
And I told you I'd help.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.097
You talk back, too.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.932
It's time you learned to behave.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.703
Hm?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.387
What does a painted elephant mean?

28:01.471 --> 28:05.015
It's not paint. It's naturally white.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.145
Buddha's mother dreamed a white elephant

28:10.230 --> 28:11.563
gave her a lotus flower three nights

28:11.648 --> 28:13.982
before she gave birth to him.

28:14.067 --> 28:17.111
And so he's there for a truce.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.405
Nobody will risk hitting him.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.908
I'm happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.

28:22.992 --> 28:27.830
Not what you would normally do, is it?

28:27.914 --> 28:29.873
It'll mix up what comes for you.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.268
Hey, Jimmy here?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.979
No, no, no, no!

29:34.063 --> 29:35.564
Okay, okay, okay.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.242
Get out.

29:48.495 --> 29:52.039
Wait, no. Not you.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.665
Did you happen to notice

29:53.750 --> 29:57.377
that the girls were mostly naked when you came in?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.963
Are those lovely breasts any clue

30:00.048 --> 30:04.092
as to who in this city might allow me to operate here?

30:04.177 --> 30:06.637
It's the same gang you're shooting at.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.556
Do I have to tell you what happens if Bhun realizes

30:09.641 --> 30:12.893
that you're using my specialized weaponry to do it?

30:12.977 --> 30:14.978
I didn't know who I was up against.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.563
Well, you do now.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.233
Does the guy that hired you
know who he's fucking with?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.526
He fired me.

30:20.610 --> 30:24.154
Oh, perfect. Well, no need to apologize.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.741
Just stay as far away from me as--

30:30.995 --> 30:32.955
Where's the gun?

30:33.039 --> 30:34.706
Why bring the bag and no gun?

30:34.791 --> 30:36.834
I needed to carry another one.

30:36.918 --> 30:37.876
That's funny.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.461
Only you're never funny.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.547
You're dark.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.925
And I don't mean skin tone.

30:45.009 --> 30:49.263
Remember what you said to me last time I saw you?

30:49.347 --> 30:51.014
"That's twice you saved my life."

30:51.099 --> 30:53.183
No. There was a time before that.

30:53.268 --> 30:57.187
Hmmm. "I swear I'll get this cash back to you."

30:57.272 --> 30:58.856
No, that was even further back.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.858
"Take your hands off of me, I don't go that way."

31:02.026 --> 31:03.110
You owe me.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.279
Another life!

31:05.363 --> 31:08.657
I don't owe anybody anything from back then.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.917
Oh, fuck me.

31:25.258 --> 31:28.510
Go see this guy. They call him the Thai Stick.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.473
Why are you doing this?

31:33.558 --> 31:34.892
They're hurting people.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.813
"They're hurting people."

31:42.275 --> 31:44.902
Christ. Even you're smiling.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.822
And you don't smile.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.074
You owe me.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.535
Now, I've seen the cigar room.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.078
M ust be a place in that warehouse

31:55.163 --> 31:56.330
where you keep the Cubans.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.415
Yeah.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.467
The Cubans aren't in the warehouse.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.620
Welcome to my humidor.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.215
I suppose you don't need...

32:48.299 --> 32:50.008
No.

32:50.093 --> 32:54.554
Colt, M4 sniper. HK PSG 1.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.391
Anything in a bigger caliber?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.017
You want to go out with a bang?

33:12.490 --> 33:15.242
For the man who has everything.

33:15.326 --> 33:18.412
Ho... wow.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.665
Barrett 82 .50 caliber.

33:21.749 --> 33:22.958
Just what I need.

33:23.042 --> 33:26.086
It's 35 pounds with the bipod.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.839
It's a lot of weight if you have to run the hundred.

33:28.923 --> 33:33.260
I suppose there's not much point in
you running, though, is there?

33:33.344 --> 33:36.430
Who's running?

33:36.514 --> 33:37.514
It's 10 Gs a day.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.099
And that's the "pay up front

33:39.183 --> 33:44.521
because you're going to be dead" buddy rate.

33:44.605 --> 33:48.025
Throw in the crotch gun.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.234
I like this one.

33:53.614 --> 33:54.740
Here.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.617
Sweet.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.412
Well, happiness is a warm gun.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.998
Hey. One more thing. Right here.

34:03.082 --> 34:03.832
Ow.

34:05.668 --> 34:08.378
Ow, what the fuck are you doing?

34:08.463 --> 34:09.670
You said, "Hit me."

34:09.755 --> 34:13.341
I know. But I wasn't ready.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.510
I thought you were gonna ask me why.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.012
I know why.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.264
If you get caught, you can tell them I robbed you.

34:20.725 --> 34:26.396
It's okay. I'm okay. It can't get much--

34:26.481 --> 34:27.522
Versace?

34:27.607 --> 34:31.318
No. It's Paul fucking Smith!

34:33.987 --> 34:34.987
I'm back.

34:38.826 --> 34:42.204
Ahh... Jesus, Mae.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.417
I gotta think.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.445
Mae, Mae.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.116
Your knots are getting sloppy.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.369
What are you doing here?

35:22.453 --> 35:24.246
I was with the monks.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.580
I saw you leaving just now.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.124
Great.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.668
You think I had gone to tell the gang about you?

35:29.752 --> 35:32.379
Just don't do that again.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.798
I am concerned about what we are doing.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.633
I went to talk to the monks about it.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.677
Really?

35:38.761 --> 35:40.804
Why does everything I say make you so angry?

35:40.888 --> 35:43.598
Because you actually seem to
believe what you're saying.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.392
No point in tying you up anymore.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.685
I told you that too.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.698
She was something to you?

35:59.782 --> 36:02.742
Something to someone else.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.662
So you right wrongs? Because it's the right thing?

36:05.746 --> 36:09.749
And because it pays.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.751
You were discussing me with them?

36:11.836 --> 36:14.921
Not just you.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.424
Whether what I do is right or wrong?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.342
There is no right or wrong.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.094
Only what is and what comes.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.763
You kill those that do great harm.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.849
The world should punish them.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.310
They're not all bad.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.811
They're good for business.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.734
Take the long way back

36:35.818 --> 36:37.402
so their ghosts cannot follow.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.282
Wait here.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.637
Okay. Too crowded.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.733
Oh, I'll definitely get back to you.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.659
Here, too.

38:57.251 --> 38:58.918
Ah, shit.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.307
Keys.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.031
Oh, my God. Mae?

41:33.115 --> 41:35.200
Come on out. Let's go.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.284
Come on.

41:39.121 --> 41:42.207
You're bleeding. You've been shot.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.583
Are you okay?

41:43.667 --> 41:47.086
Not really. I didn't know they were in there.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.588
Maybe you can help them.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.507
Well, they can leave.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.425
Let's go. Before they come.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.801
Let's go.

42:02.144 --> 42:03.770
You can't let them do this to you.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.104
Come on, let's go!

42:05.189 --> 42:06.314
No, take us back.

42:06.398 --> 42:09.400
Yes, what are you doing?

42:09.485 --> 42:10.610
Take us back!

42:10.694 --> 42:12.946
What? Come on, you're free now.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.988
Come.

42:14.073 --> 42:14.906
It's okay.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.241
Come with me now.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.951
You're free to go now.

42:18.035 --> 42:19.285
No!

42:19.370 --> 42:22.830
They'll find us. They'll kill us!

42:22.915 --> 42:26.376
It's because of the drugs. They need to go back.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.393
What were you doing in there?

42:43.477 --> 42:45.728
They put us in the truck when you attacked.

42:45.813 --> 42:49.065
Not the truck! What were you doing in the house?

42:49.149 --> 42:53.236
Fuck.

42:53.320 --> 42:56.656
I went to tell them if they would
stop what they are doing

42:56.740 --> 42:58.825
you would stop killing them.

42:58.909 --> 43:02.662
We shouldn't have left the girls.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.208
That's not what I do.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.127
Even if they get out

43:09.211 --> 43:15.049
what's been done to them is who they are now.

43:15.134 --> 43:19.053
What do you keep staring at?

43:19.138 --> 43:21.306
You crazy.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.238
Don't touch it.

44:40.761 --> 44:44.639
Well, I hope you got the prick who stole this.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.307
You were robbed?

44:46.392 --> 44:50.269
Yes. Surprised him at my warehouse
yesterday on his way out.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.605
So, did you get a good look?

44:52.690 --> 44:56.234
For as long as it took for him to break my nose.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.735
White boy, you know

44:57.820 --> 44:59.779
about my height but, uh, packing pounds.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.155
Blond hair. Goatee.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.574
Face like a smacked ass.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.869
Hey, I thought I was protected.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.663
They hit me, they hit you. Right?

45:09.873 --> 45:11.124
Ah!

45:11.208 --> 45:14.043
You recall any details, you will let us know.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.212
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

45:37.443 --> 45:40.111
I will take care of you.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.404
Mae?

45:41.488 --> 45:44.949
I will love you in so many ways.

45:46.952 --> 45:50.455
Touch you in so many places.

45:54.543 --> 45:59.422
Make you feel so good.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.595
You are so cold.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.811
Who took the bullet out?

46:13.896 --> 46:15.688
It went right through.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.191
Looks like you have attracted a few bad spirits.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.486
Ah, here you go talking that nonsense again.

46:25.365 --> 46:27.241
Khamin chan and other herbs

46:27.326 --> 46:29.577
and holy ash from a sacrificial fire.

46:29.661 --> 46:30.787
It will protect you.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.705
Oh, no.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.666
The monks do not know what you do, so they help.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.381
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.383
Maybe that's a good thing.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.889
Maybe better to let you bleed to death.

46:49.973 --> 46:53.017
It would be easier for you to die and start over.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.734
Why are you looking at me that way?

47:01.819 --> 47:05.071
Oh, I'm just wondering if I'm still dreaming.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.490
Or maybe you were awake.

47:07.574 --> 47:10.076
And are now dreaming.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.207
I have no idea what you're talking about.

47:24.675 --> 47:28.261
You look like you're being followed, English.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.435
Got you.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.419
Oh, no.

48:01.503 --> 48:04.714
Not you again. Upstairs.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.258
Come on.

48:07.342 --> 48:09.051
I got your gun.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.595
Yeah. One of them.

48:10.679 --> 48:12.388
They found my Barrett so they're all over out there.

48:12.472 --> 48:13.931
Not anymore.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.600
Oh, great.

48:15.684 --> 48:18.019
So with that, you just confirmed my involvement.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.354
Don't answer it.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.648
Bastards can track that as good as the government.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.611
It's not mine. I took it off one of
the guys outside your place.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.571
Then they're checking in. Come on.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.742
We're taking the high ground.

48:32.826 --> 48:34.827
I need something for up close.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.288
Another gun?

48:37.372 --> 48:39.332
And you lied about bringing back the last one.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.667
Right. And?

48:41.752 --> 48:44.962
No. No. No way. No. Not happening.

48:45.047 --> 48:46.422
No, no, no.

48:53.430 --> 48:56.140
Because I'm dead. Put your boss on.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.808
You want to say hello?

49:03.690 --> 49:06.233
Now am I getting what I want?

49:06.318 --> 49:07.485
What is it you want?

49:07.569 --> 49:09.153
Not you. Hold on.

49:09.237 --> 49:12.406
Well?

49:12.491 --> 49:14.367
I'll give you some time to think about it.

49:14.451 --> 49:15.993
I'm back.

49:16.078 --> 49:19.872
We should meet. Come to some understanding.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.750
I will never have any understanding of what you do.

49:22.834 --> 49:24.210
Hm.

49:24.294 --> 49:27.463
You understand that most of these girls

49:27.547 --> 49:30.341
are sold by their own parents?

49:30.425 --> 49:34.011
To pay off debt, or just abandoned?

49:34.096 --> 49:36.555
That we find a place for them

49:36.640 --> 49:41.227
and for doing so take some small profit

49:41.311 --> 49:47.400
from something they'll give away
or trade for less on their own.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.485
You understand we give

49:49.569 --> 49:52.905
what little they have to offer value?

49:52.990 --> 49:54.740
You give bullets value.

49:54.825 --> 49:55.950
Now you want to give me what I want

49:56.034 --> 50:00.079
or you want to talk to the boss?

50:15.095 --> 50:17.930
I'm glad you find this so amusing.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.098
Get out.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.599
Just get out.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.438
I have to keep going.

50:25.522 --> 50:27.356
You're not gonna shoot me.

50:27.441 --> 50:28.858
I might as well.

50:28.942 --> 50:31.444
You're as good as dead unless I get another gun.

50:31.528 --> 50:33.070
Now give me another gun

50:33.155 --> 50:36.157
so there won't be anybody left to come after you.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.747
Cobray Street Sweeper.

50:42.831 --> 50:45.916
I'll take this.

50:46.001 --> 50:49.128
It's a thousand a day.

50:49.212 --> 50:52.131
You know, you're always out there.

50:52.215 --> 50:55.342
When did you start believing that you can't be killed?

51:01.475 --> 51:02.558
I haven't.

51:11.234 --> 51:12.902
Do you like what you do?

51:18.325 --> 51:20.618
I do it without remorse.

51:20.702 --> 51:24.246
I cast no shadow about it.

51:24.331 --> 51:28.084
I ntent is most important for future well-being.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.794
I ntent makes karma.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.837
What will you do with the money you are paid?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.215
You know, all this is just what you've come up with

51:34.299 --> 51:37.176
to fool yourself into some kind of happiness.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.011
And what do you use to fool yourself?

51:39.096 --> 51:43.390
It doesn't get any more real than what I do.

51:43.475 --> 51:46.310
You do not know as much as you think you do.

51:46.394 --> 51:48.020
Starting from who you are

51:48.105 --> 51:50.231
all the way to the man in that hotel room.

51:50.315 --> 51:52.358
What do you know about him?

51:52.442 --> 51:54.068
You've seen him before?

51:54.152 --> 51:55.069
Hm.

52:32.315 --> 52:34.650
You are crazy, man.

52:34.734 --> 52:36.402
I told you to stop killing them.

52:36.486 --> 52:39.155
You owe me. Ten o'clock. Same hotel room.

52:41.658 --> 52:45.494
Hey, mister.
How much longer you waiting?

52:56.673 --> 52:57.673
Follow him.

53:39.507 --> 53:41.217
Hey, can I help you?

53:41.301 --> 53:43.135
Uh, yes.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.721
Twelve and, uh, fifteen are available.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.560
Twelve.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.437
She'd be my choice. Youngest.

53:53.521 --> 53:55.022
But don't let her age fool you.

53:55.106 --> 53:56.899
Down the hall. Take a left.

53:56.983 --> 53:58.442
Up the stairs. Green door.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.978
What can I do for you?

54:34.062 --> 54:36.188
Whatever you want, big man.

54:36.273 --> 54:40.192
Okay. Sit. Sit... sit down.

54:40.277 --> 54:43.696
You know the man with the big ruby ring?

54:43.780 --> 54:46.198
Where is he?

54:46.283 --> 54:48.117
I will do whatever you want.

54:48.201 --> 54:53.289
Is he the boss or a customer?

54:53.373 --> 54:55.708
There are many men who come.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.502
Where is his office?

54:58.586 --> 55:00.796
Where is his office?

55:00.880 --> 55:03.048
He is upstairs. Top floor.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.217
I want him alive.

57:10.301 --> 57:11.593
Alive.

57:52.343 --> 57:54.303
Wait. Coming out.

57:54.387 --> 57:56.054
Coming out.

57:57.682 --> 57:58.765
I can explain.

58:04.647 --> 58:05.981
Empty it.

58:06.065 --> 58:07.107
The safe!

58:07.192 --> 58:08.233
Okay.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.234
I wasn't told you were a crook.

58:09.319 --> 58:10.152
I'm not.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.740
You're now paying for the numbers
I just racked up here.

58:14.824 --> 58:16.283
What's this really about?

58:16.367 --> 58:18.619
Would you have gone at the whole gang if I'd told you?

58:18.703 --> 58:20.037
So what gang are you?

58:20.121 --> 58:22.039
Am I a way of making war with the Chang Kao

58:22.123 --> 58:24.249
without you losing men?

58:24.334 --> 58:25.125
Hmm?

58:25.210 --> 58:28.504
Do you really care?

58:29.464 --> 58:30.756
Huh?

58:30.840 --> 58:32.674
I wanted you alive

58:32.759 --> 58:34.635
so I could double everything.

58:34.719 --> 58:35.719
For one more man.

58:39.140 --> 58:41.016
Advisor Bhun.

58:42.852 --> 58:44.561
Why him and not the boss?

58:44.646 --> 58:48.440
The old man is sick. He'll be dead soon.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.067
You're thinking about it.

58:50.151 --> 58:53.153
'Cause if you weren't, I'd already be dead.

58:53.238 --> 58:54.905
Why are you looking at me like that?

58:54.989 --> 58:57.574
Does any of it really matter why you're doing it?

58:57.659 --> 59:01.411
Does it have anything to do with
my story of, of the daughter?

59:01.496 --> 59:03.747
Another million for one man.

59:45.707 --> 59:49.835
Try and focus on my neck and shoulders.

59:51.671 --> 59:52.838
Too much stress.

59:52.922 --> 59:54.339
Oh, you have no idea.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.008
But why do you say that like it's a good thing?

59:57.135 --> 59:58.260
I want his name.

59:58.344 --> 59:59.595
And I want to know

59:59.679 --> 01:00:02.472
who needed me in my underwear for this?

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.019
What's his name?

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.186
Puddin' Thame.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.354
Ask me again

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.025
I'll tell you the same.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:19.031
Oh, fuck.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.198
His name?

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.950
You're pissing in the wind.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.539
Why do you work against us?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.207
You are in the same business.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:32.294
No, the girls that work for me--

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.505
have filled out an application.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.133
They enjoy their work. They're artists.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.018
All right! All right! I'll tell you.

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.353
I'll tell you.

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:55.525
Not because it hurts.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.527
But because

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:00.322
he... wouldn't care.

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:02.157
It's Church.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.284
Curtie Church.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:08.080
And who would want someone with
the skills of Curtie Church here?

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.915
I don't know.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.253
Where is he?

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.255
I don't know that.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.550
Who is he working for?

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.011
I don't know that either!

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.139
Do you think he'd be stupid enough to tell me?

01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:42.906
Why do you help him against us?

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.575
Because I'm more afraid of him--

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.912
than I am of you. You understand?

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:51.957
And you haven't even pissed him off yet.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:02:01.216
What he's doing to you is death taking a holiday.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.098
You're already dead.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.509
You don't sleep so well, do you?

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.602
I didn't do anything bad enough to deserve this.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.444
Will you go out again tonight?

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:16.364
No.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.533
No, I'm done here.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.749
Going to the toilet.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.795
You want to watch, you handle the paperwork.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.767
I told them who you are.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.728
For real this time.

01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:53.145
And not because they broke me.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:56.274
But because now you have no choice but to run.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:59.194
Already decided I'm out. What about you?

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:01.613
I'll figure something out.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.781
But you're willing to do that?

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.035
Listen, I need one last thing. I need to set a girl up.

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:12.123
Maybe 14. Adoption and private
school. How much for that?

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:19.088
Don't know. Ten Gs will buy a family and a history.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:21.799
Another 20 will pay her way till she graduates.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.176
Cool. Done.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.719
I told her to wait at the Lotus Temple.

01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:26.679
Your half of the money's there, and your guns.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.264
Hey! Hey! What are you doing in there?

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.601
I can't concentrate in here if you're listening.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.565
I guess I'll, uh, you know, see you down the road.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:41.277
Thanks, English.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.946
Hey! Hey! Let's go.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:52.705
Crap, oh, that feels good.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.332
Oh, here's an idea.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:55.375
Why don't you guys

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.377
just go out of the room,

01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:58.670
one at a time come back in,

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.171
and we'll see who's made of what, huh?

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.675
I'll take you up on that.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.230
Just spoke to him.

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:18.439
Where is he?

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:21.359
Good news. He's going to disappear.

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.028
And you'll be your father's son again in no time.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.405
We're good.

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.699
You gave his name, and we're gonna find him.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:30.535
What do you mean? No. No, no,
you don't have to do that.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.537
You know he went too far.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:35.873
I need his head now to assure the position.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.150
This is for you.

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:10.742
No one ever gave me--

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.175
Thank you.

01:12:27.259 --> 01:12:28.509
You're welcome.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:34.766
My name is Curtie.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.769
Curtie Church.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.483
Like hurt? Only friendlier?

01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:45.651
No, like Curtis.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:48.363
Only misspelled on my birth certificate.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:49.947
It was meant to be.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.199
And April second...

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:53.951
month and date of my birth.

01:12:58.415 --> 01:13:03.669
Today's Friday, so wear blue for luck today.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.631
Tomorrow wear pink.

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.717
Ooh. Tomorrow may be a bad day for me then.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.345
You can wear it underneath.

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:13.930
That could make it even worse.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:31.155
Listen, I want to thank you for
taking an interest in me.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.910
You're wrong. I'm just doing it for me.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.294
You're leaving me, aren't you?

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.598
I have someone coming for you

01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.101
who will help you.

01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:03.896
You have to promise me you will wait here. Hmm?

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.859
Promise?

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:12.363
Okay.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.949
Hmm.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:55.990
Yeah, Jimmy?

01:14:56.074 --> 01:14:57.909
I was hoping I'd catch you.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.994
Yeah, the flight's just about to leave.

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:02.413
At the airport already, huh?

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.167
I don't blame you. Too many ghosts.

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:07.793
Did you get your money?

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:11.005
Yeah. It's too much. But, uh, thanks for that.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:13.049
The reason I'm calling is, um

01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:15.968
your girl, she wasn't there.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:19.639
I mpossible. She wouldn't leave. Did you wait?

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:20.765
I waited.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.558
Sorry, Church.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:23.726
Thanks.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:32.360
Well, I hope this confirms my loyalty.

01:15:57.302 --> 01:15:58.761
Fucking Jimmy.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.806
Come on! Let's go!

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.865
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:10.119
Wait.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:14.832
Oh, English.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.460
How many times did I tell you to leave?

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.335
Shoot the son of a bitch.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.504
Are you insane? No!

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:25.634
Okay. Couple million dollars and your life for the girls.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.386
Who paid you the money to do this?

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.388
Ask him.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.056
We're gonna talk to this devil

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.808
while he holds a gun to my father's head?

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:36.187
Hey, hey. Let this son of the bitch speak.

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:37.772
No, it's too late for that.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:42.359
Don't move.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.361
Hold your fire.

01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:51.535
Changed my mind.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.415
Was it my son who arranged this?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.001
Was he trying to kill the secret with you?

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.342
Bring the girls in.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.862
There's one missing.

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:30.199
Where's the one you took from the temple? Mae.

01:20:30.283 --> 01:20:35.079
There was no one there except the monks.

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:37.998
I don't remember any Mae.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.000
I'll find you, Mae.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:53.597
Mae. Here. That's Mae for you.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.475
Oh, that Mae.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.269
Oh, yes. That Mae.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.854
You're insane.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.230
What are you talking about?

01:21:01.314 --> 01:21:03.107
I remember her.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.942
She was special.

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:06.944
First girl that I brought in.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:09.154
And that's me beside her.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.869
Some 30 years ago.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:19.206
It's not a coincidence.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.375
It was meant to be that I find you.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:28.048
Church. What's going on?

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:32.469
Do we have a deal on the others?

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.637
I want to thank you for

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.306
taking an interest in me.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.516
I am just doing it for me.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:39.435
Do we have a deal?

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:41.020
It's in the car.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:57.161
I will take care of you.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.622
Mae?

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:00.915
Mae?

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.249
Drive!

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:03.876
You crazy.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:09.340
You crazy...

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:12.259
Put the guns down.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:16.639
And let them go.

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:18.140
So you right wrongs

01:22:18.224 --> 01:22:20.351
because it's the right thing?

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:24.188
I'm happy that you have decided
to stay here and continue.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:26.023
We shouldn't have left the girls.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:29.109
Maybe you can help them.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:35.282
Get your bag.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.460
It was all about bringing you

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:49.588
to a place of understanding.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:54.385
My voice was there to help you all along.

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:56.345
It was about bringing you to the decision

01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:59.682
to stay here and right these wrongs.

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:59.658
So I guess, uh, one of those spirits really found you.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.245
Guess that's a good thing.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.622
Before you were losing your mind.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.709
English. Stop the truck.

01:24:08.793 --> 01:24:10.794
English...

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.921
Please, stop the truck.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:41.909
I have to go back.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.411
I'll see to it that they get help.

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:47.915
Thanks, buddy.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:02.346
I can now be with you, Curtie Church.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.598
And you can be with me.

01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:07.059
With the darkness which you offer.

01:25:07.143 --> 01:25:09.478
And which my light needs to shine.

01:25:09.562 --> 01:25:13.273
It was the initiation of a monk.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:16.401
A monk...

01:25:17.305 --> 01:25:23.296
