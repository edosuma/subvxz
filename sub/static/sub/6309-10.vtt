00:01.979 --> 00:04.981
â™ª

00:04.982 --> 00:07.517
Librarians, talk to me!
What's happening?

00:07.518 --> 00:09.769
No response on any
military signal protocol.

00:09.770 --> 00:11.654
These are secure links
through buried cables

00:11.655 --> 00:12.604
of hardened cell towers.

00:12.605 --> 00:14.211
It's supposed to work
during a nuclear war.

00:14.212 --> 00:15.963
Okay, all military
communications are down.

00:15.964 --> 00:17.932
- What else?!
- No Internet.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.884
You can push the signals
through the physical pipes,

00:19.885 --> 00:21.385
but the nodes aren't responding.

00:21.386 --> 00:24.188
The Internet is gone. Welcome to 1995.

00:24.189 --> 00:26.023
Ooh, I hope not.

00:26.024 --> 00:28.359
I made some very poor bicycle
pant choices back in '95.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.394
There are no good bicycle pant choices.

00:30.395 --> 00:32.229
I just got into the
conduits in the street.

00:32.229 --> 00:34.565
There ain't no electricity.
I mean, at all.

00:34.566 --> 00:36.988
I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna try
to find the difference

00:36.989 --> 00:38.285
between the alternating
and direct currents.

00:38.286 --> 00:40.404
Maybe just a-a battery
that'll hold a change.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.694
This isn't 1995. This is 1859.

00:42.695 --> 00:44.562
Carrington Event.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.664
Massive solar flare that supercharged

00:46.665 --> 00:48.449
the Earth's electromagnetic field

00:48.450 --> 00:51.786
causing anything even remotely
electric to become fried?

00:51.787 --> 00:54.005
Telegraph machines bursting into flames,

00:54.006 --> 00:55.924
sparks dancing along telephone lines.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.098
This is just a modern-day
version, frying computer chips.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.603
Okay, well, that would just
burn out electronics,

00:59.604 --> 01:01.102
not keep electricity itself from working.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.605
No, no, no, no, it's a
magic Carrington Event.

01:03.606 --> 01:05.740
You see, instead of
electromagnetic energy,

01:05.741 --> 01:07.642
Prospero has infused the atmosphere

01:07.643 --> 01:10.712
with electromagic energy
rewriting the laws of physics.

01:10.713 --> 01:12.714
Right now nothing electronic is working.

01:12.715 --> 01:15.383
If this continues, it
may never work again.

01:15.384 --> 01:17.786
We never get technology back. Ever.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.688
He's remaking the world.

01:19.689 --> 01:21.656
Into what?

01:21.657 --> 01:24.693
[Breathing heavily]

01:24.694 --> 01:26.328
A forest.

01:26.329 --> 01:28.697
Cassandra's managed to
link into some satellites

01:28.698 --> 01:30.131
that are above the ionosphere,

01:30.132 --> 01:31.833
so out of the effect of the ley lines.

01:31.834 --> 01:34.336
- Ah.
- They can't send or receive signals,

01:34.337 --> 01:36.004
but news satellites with live broadcasts,

01:36.005 --> 01:37.472
they have a video buffer.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.941
They retain a certain amount
of data before broadcasting it.

01:39.942 --> 01:42.445
So we can see the news from
right before it got cut out.

01:42.479 --> 01:44.546
- Good intel.
- [Typing]

01:44.547 --> 01:45.881
MAN: <i>As we are seeing below us,</i>

01:45.882 --> 01:48.216
<i>a giant forest is growing
out of downtown...</i>

01:48.217 --> 01:50.285
Giant forest.

01:50.286 --> 01:51.453
Yes.

01:51.454 --> 01:53.355
And at this rate,

01:53.356 --> 01:54.456
he will turn the entire world

01:54.457 --> 01:57.025
into an arboreal paradise within days.

01:57.026 --> 01:58.460
Maybe a few hours.

01:58.461 --> 02:00.529
Well, we're luck... Jeez.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.063
- [Inhales sharply]
- Dangerous?

02:02.064 --> 02:03.465
- No.
- It's just lucky

02:03.466 --> 02:05.267
that he's only using the
Staff of Zarathustra

02:05.268 --> 02:06.434
to aid him in his spells,

02:06.435 --> 02:08.303
'cause if it had been the
original Staff of Power,

02:08.304 --> 02:09.670
it would be a lot worse.

02:09.672 --> 02:13.208
Wait, could we use the Staff
of Power to reverse this?

02:13.209 --> 02:14.809
Uh, yes, that probably would be

02:14.810 --> 02:16.344
the only artifact with enough power,

02:16.345 --> 02:18.713
but as you know it's
broken, back in 1611.

02:18.714 --> 02:22.918
In fact, I will make a
list of all the artifacts

02:22.919 --> 02:24.219
that have enough power.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.088
It may take me a second.

02:27.089 --> 02:29.324
That's your left-hand handwriting.

02:29.325 --> 02:31.326
Yes.

02:31.327 --> 02:33.895
Where's the note we found,
Jenkins, from the broken staff?

02:33.896 --> 02:36.397
Uh, top right drawer, Colonel.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.571
Write this with your left hand.

02:42.572 --> 02:44.472
"Not yet..."

02:44.473 --> 02:45.874
- "Not yet..."
- "Not yet..."

02:45.875 --> 02:46.975
- "...but soon..."
- "...but soon..."

02:46.976 --> 02:49.377
"...and long ago.
I pray your journey..."

02:49.378 --> 02:50.712
"I pray your journey..."

02:50.713 --> 02:52.247
- "...does not end..."
- "...does not end..."

02:52.248 --> 02:54.516
BOTH: "...in woe."

02:54.517 --> 02:56.785
Whoa.

02:56.786 --> 02:58.053
BOTH: Whoa.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.455
- Whoa.
- That's your handwriting.

03:00.456 --> 03:03.291
- That's my left-hand writing.
- Left-hand handwriting, yes.

03:03.292 --> 03:05.527
I just didn't... I didn't recognize it.

03:05.528 --> 03:08.997
I wrote that note to
myself in the past?

03:08.998 --> 03:11.533
[Gasps]

03:11.534 --> 03:13.368
I know when the staff pieces are.

03:13.369 --> 03:17.005
- Where?
- Not where. When.

03:17.006 --> 03:21.176
[Branches crackling]

03:21.177 --> 03:26.481
[Whooshing]

03:26.482 --> 03:27.716
[Whooshing stops]

03:27.717 --> 03:30.485
What the devil are you doing?

03:30.486 --> 03:32.587
The eternal forest

03:32.588 --> 03:36.257
within which men and women find joy,

03:36.258 --> 03:39.461
simplicity, their true nature.

03:39.462 --> 03:42.964
'Tis a happy ending for all humanity,

03:42.965 --> 03:45.066
I gift to thee.

03:45.067 --> 03:48.069
I'm more of a city villain
than a country bumpkin.

03:48.070 --> 03:51.072
You asked for refuge,
and I gave it to you.

03:51.073 --> 03:54.342
I took mercy on the
Librarians as you asked.

03:54.343 --> 03:58.479
'Tis no fault of mine
you cannot hold a spell.

04:01.416 --> 04:03.184
This is not your story.

04:03.185 --> 04:04.552
What?

04:04.553 --> 04:06.187
There is nothing in the
play "The Tempest"

04:06.188 --> 04:07.889
that says this is what you want,

04:07.890 --> 04:09.324
what Prospero wants.

04:09.325 --> 04:11.993
No, this?

04:11.994 --> 04:15.963
This is someone else's dream.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.536
[Crackling] You know not my mind!

04:21.536 --> 04:23.171
Arrogant knave!

04:23.172 --> 04:26.508
I summoned thee and I can crush thee!

04:26.509 --> 04:28.109
[Groans]

04:28.110 --> 04:30.378
You will see.

04:30.379 --> 04:32.113
You will all see...

04:32.114 --> 04:34.314
in time.

04:38.053 --> 04:39.954
[Door unlocks]

04:39.955 --> 04:41.389
Is this the time machine room?

04:41.390 --> 04:43.391
Of course, it's the time machine room.

04:43.392 --> 04:46.227
The Library has to have
a time machine room.

04:46.228 --> 04:48.229
These are all time machines?

04:48.230 --> 04:50.632
All locked down and taken apart

04:50.633 --> 04:53.768
to make sure that they
never, ever work again.

04:53.769 --> 04:57.272
All their owners tried
to change history,

04:57.273 --> 04:59.908
got caught in temporal loops
because you can never,

04:59.909 --> 05:03.678
ever, ever violate causality.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.448
The very first time traveler learned

05:06.449 --> 05:08.216
that if you change any
event in the past,

05:08.217 --> 05:10.085
any event of significance in the past,

05:10.086 --> 05:11.386
your timeline collapses,

05:11.387 --> 05:13.655
your entire history wiped out.

05:13.656 --> 05:16.024
That's why you left the vague note.

05:16.025 --> 05:19.060
Future me knew that past me
was going to John Dee's estate,

05:19.061 --> 05:21.544
but I couldn't tell past me
because that would violate

05:21.545 --> 05:22.931
the chain of events leading present me

05:22.932 --> 05:25.800
to know that future me
was going into the past.

05:25.801 --> 05:29.037
- I'm going to hate time travel, aren't I?
- A lot.

05:29.038 --> 05:32.407
Ah! Here we go. This is the one.

05:32.408 --> 05:34.676
We do have a little wiggle room, however...
[Keys jingle]

05:34.677 --> 05:37.579
because we know the staff is broken.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.048
But we don't know how.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.650
And we only vaguely know when.

05:42.651 --> 05:46.955
So there's a lot of
uncertainty in the story.

05:46.956 --> 05:49.290
So if we borrow the staff,
bring it back to the present,

05:49.291 --> 05:50.325
use it to defeat Prospero,

05:50.326 --> 05:52.393
and then break it
without anybody knowing,

05:52.394 --> 05:54.529
we didn't violate any rules.
It's Schroedinger's Cat.

05:54.530 --> 05:57.132
No, he's upstairs in the
Theoretical Animals wing.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.900
- He's alive?
- And if we screw up?

05:58.901 --> 06:00.135
Grab that base.

06:00.136 --> 06:01.803
Then we suffer the fate

06:01.804 --> 06:05.306
of the very first time traveler.

06:05.307 --> 06:07.408
Dr. Pinkerton Chantasaur.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.347
Was the world originally ruled
by talking dinosaurs, Flynn?

06:10.348 --> 06:11.619
Were we all dinosaurs?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.493
- Don't even think about it.
- Was there a dinosaur me?

06:13.494 --> 06:14.715
I said don't think about it.

06:15.054 --> 06:18.319
Remember, in 1611, they didn't, um...

06:18.320 --> 06:20.972
You know, don't do anything
that's gonna change history.

06:20.973 --> 06:22.910
Don't say anything to anybody
that's gonna violate

06:22.911 --> 06:24.411
cause and effect, that's
gonna tell people

06:24.412 --> 06:26.517
- what's gonna happen.
- Right. Cause and effect.

06:26.518 --> 06:27.228
All right, all right, all right.

06:27.229 --> 06:29.430
Hey, you're gonna be there
at the Library in 1611,

06:29.431 --> 06:31.099
- right, Jenkins?
- Uh, no.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.803
No, I had a midlife crisis
during the Elizabethan era.

06:34.804 --> 06:36.538
[Inhales sharply] I was a mess.

06:36.539 --> 06:37.872
Yeah, well, we're not
going to the Library.

06:37.873 --> 06:40.708
I'm calibrating this for
Prospero's first manifestation.

06:40.709 --> 06:43.111
If we can figure out how
Shakespeare creates Prospero,

06:43.112 --> 06:45.713
then we grab the staff...

06:45.714 --> 06:47.115
[Whooshes]

06:47.116 --> 06:48.616
That should bring us home.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.820
Or in 1611, we just stop
Prospero from ever...

06:51.821 --> 06:54.197
No, no, no, no, 'cause then,
we wouldn't have to go back

06:54.198 --> 06:55.637
and then we wouldn't
have stopped Prospero.

06:55.638 --> 06:56.602
Then we wouldn't have to go back

06:56.603 --> 06:57.668
and then we wouldn't have
stopped Prospero.

06:57.669 --> 06:59.467
Then we'd have to go back
and we wouldn't stop Prospero.

06:59.468 --> 07:00.104
I'm <i>really</i> gonna hate time travel.

07:00.105 --> 07:01.687
The good news is that
no matter how much time

07:01.688 --> 07:04.056
we spend in the past, we
return to this very moment.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.425
From your perspective,
we're gone no time at all.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.524
5-second drift, maybe.
We'll be back 5 seconds, tops.

07:09.525 --> 07:11.198
What if you don't make it back?

07:11.199 --> 07:12.365
Hmm.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.333
That's why you're staying.

07:14.334 --> 07:19.338
If we don't come back, you
have to stop Prospero somehow.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.607
I have faith in you.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.875
You've trained for this.

07:29.915 --> 07:34.687
[Whooshing]

07:34.688 --> 07:36.488
- Aah!
- [Glass shatters]

07:37.356 --> 07:40.092
[Gasps] How will they get back?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.961
- One second.
- They're not.

07:41.962 --> 07:42.935
Two.

07:42.936 --> 07:44.478
I mean, there has to
be another way, right?

07:44.479 --> 07:45.132
Three.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.360
Each time machine carves
its own path through time.

07:47.361 --> 07:50.736
- Four.
- You must use the same machine to return.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.071
- That's five.
- Wh...

07:52.072 --> 07:55.673
The sphere... it's... destroyed.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.679
They're never, ever coming back.

08:17.805 --> 08:19.473
Do you see that?

08:19.774 --> 08:21.775
- Ghosts from the past.
- [Ghostly voices echo indistinctly]

08:21.776 --> 08:25.846
Not spirits. We see the past itself.

08:25.847 --> 08:27.558
How?

08:28.449 --> 08:30.851
This place is the seat of my power,

08:30.852 --> 08:32.586
where I first became real.

08:32.587 --> 08:36.121
Someone has connected
that moment and this.

08:36.123 --> 08:40.558
Someone... walks through time.

08:42.193 --> 08:47.198
Could someone strike
you down in the past?

08:49.502 --> 08:51.738
They could.

08:51.739 --> 08:55.140
I have one last mission for you, villain.

08:55.141 --> 08:56.809
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:56.810 --> 08:59.011
Okay, okay. Say they're not coming back.

08:59.012 --> 09:00.312
But they are coming back.

09:00.313 --> 09:02.681
How would Colonel Baird run this?

09:02.682 --> 09:04.350
She would observe.

09:04.351 --> 09:06.051
She'd put the facts together.

09:06.052 --> 09:07.319
There are no facts.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.421
We've researched Prospero
and Fictionals for months,

09:09.422 --> 09:10.823
and we came up empty.

09:10.824 --> 09:13.659
All we learned is they can't
be destroyed, only banished.

09:13.660 --> 09:16.095
Prospero's been around 500 years.

09:16.096 --> 09:19.965
We would need an incredibly
powerful personal link.

09:19.966 --> 09:21.767
We have a clue... the note.

09:21.768 --> 09:24.336
The one hint Flynn sent
himself from the future.

09:24.337 --> 09:26.705
I mean, there's no way that
it just has one meaning, right?

09:26.706 --> 09:29.341
It's just parchment.

09:29.342 --> 09:32.645
Also with linen weave.
It's royal quality.

09:32.646 --> 09:36.080
Look at that. It's a crest, watermark.

09:37.182 --> 09:39.718
Why not just write,
"Hey, guys, I'm in the past.

09:39.719 --> 09:40.953
Here's how you defeat Prospero"?

09:40.954 --> 09:43.355
Well, if Mr. Carsen,
through some misadventure,

09:43.356 --> 09:45.558
had found this note before
that day in New York,

09:45.559 --> 09:48.427
had he identified Prospero any earlier,

09:48.428 --> 09:50.863
if that day had been
different in any way...

09:50.864 --> 09:52.197
Paradox.

09:52.198 --> 09:54.466
We have to figure this out as we go.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.068
All right.

09:56.069 --> 09:58.737
The Count and Countess Pembroke.

09:58.738 --> 10:01.473
Pembroke.

10:01.474 --> 10:03.776
Why does that name
sound familiar to me?

10:03.777 --> 10:06.011
Mary Sidney.

10:06.012 --> 10:07.613
Wilton House.

10:07.614 --> 10:10.882
Fire up the back door.
We just got our first clue.

10:14.286 --> 10:15.621
[Exhales]

10:15.622 --> 10:18.223
- We're somewhere.
- Or some <i>when.</i>

10:18.224 --> 10:20.658
Do not try and make that a thing.

10:22.061 --> 10:24.128
Who be you, then?

10:25.531 --> 10:28.567
Your garb is strange.

10:28.568 --> 10:31.704
And why does the tall boy
wear his hair such?

10:31.705 --> 10:33.372
- [Laughs]
- "Boy"?

10:33.373 --> 10:36.075
[Lowered voice] Average height
for a man in 1611 is 5'5".

10:36.076 --> 10:39.178
For a woman it's only 5 feet.
Let me do all the talking.

10:39.179 --> 10:41.780
I'm a master of dialects.

10:41.781 --> 10:43.382
[Exaggerated accent] Prithee sirrahs,

10:43.383 --> 10:45.184
we are but humble travelers

10:45.185 --> 10:48.554
upon yon road come forthwith
from Londontowne,

10:48.555 --> 10:52.757
whence we purchased
these robes of foreign soils.

10:53.726 --> 10:57.196
Spies. They're clearly spies, right?

10:57.197 --> 10:58.430
Right.

10:58.431 --> 10:59.798
Foreign spies!

10:59.799 --> 11:02.701
Masterful dialecting.
Dialected the hell out of that.

11:02.702 --> 11:05.938
[Grunting]

11:05.939 --> 11:08.641
God, this man smells very bad!

11:08.642 --> 11:11.343
Well, don't hurt him too badly.
He could be an ancestor.

11:11.344 --> 11:13.879
[Straining] Aid! Aid!

11:13.880 --> 11:17.883
Ugh, ugh! It's on me!
His smell is on me!

11:17.884 --> 11:21.587
Like, like, like, like a bad ham
drank burnt coffee

11:21.588 --> 11:23.856
and then jogged 5 miles in old underwear

11:23.857 --> 11:25.658
he never took off ever! [Sniffs]

11:25.659 --> 11:27.326
[Strained voice] They never
really talk about that

11:27.327 --> 11:29.595
in the old movies about time travel.

11:29.596 --> 11:31.430
- The past stinks.
- [Shoe thuds]

11:31.431 --> 11:34.033
Also, there's going to be
a surprising amount of pus.

11:34.034 --> 11:36.101
Now put on that man's clothes.

11:36.102 --> 11:38.370
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No way.

11:38.371 --> 11:41.674
- Nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope.
- Eve, you have flawless skin.

11:41.675 --> 11:42.546
And you're a foot and a half

11:42.547 --> 11:43.835
taller than any other woman around,

11:43.836 --> 11:45.950
and you're wearing pants.
You're not gonna fit in.

11:47.447 --> 11:49.647
[Blusters]

11:51.717 --> 11:53.085
Uhh!

11:53.086 --> 11:55.219
[Body thuds]

11:58.424 --> 12:00.192
Come with me if you want to live.

12:00.193 --> 12:02.628
Please do not tell me that is
a robot from the future.

12:02.629 --> 12:05.062
I could not process that right now.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.668
Prospero.

12:11.870 --> 12:13.572
Where's Moriarty?

12:13.573 --> 12:16.842
I'm betting he sent him back
in time to stop Flynn and Baird.

12:16.843 --> 12:18.410
We can't warn them.

12:18.411 --> 12:20.212
We can only send messages
one way through time...

12:20.213 --> 12:22.047
forward, the long way around.

12:22.048 --> 12:23.949
Colonel Baird and Mr. Carsen
can fend for themselves.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.351
We need to get inside Wilton House.

12:26.352 --> 12:28.187
[Lowered voice] Of course,
the Wilton House.

12:28.188 --> 12:30.122
The Countess Pembroke, Mary Sidney,

12:30.123 --> 12:31.523
she was one of Shakespeare's patrons.

12:31.524 --> 12:34.059
In fact, his troupe used to come
here in summer from London.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.394
London... [British accent]
Thank you very much.

12:35.395 --> 12:39.031
[Normal voice] London in the
summer can get a bit plague-y.

12:39.032 --> 12:42.034
And that is rat.
[Retches, spits]

12:42.035 --> 12:44.770
- [Retches]
- Very, very ratty.

12:44.771 --> 12:47.272
The first performance of
Shakespeare's "Tempest"

12:47.273 --> 12:48.607
is here today.

12:48.608 --> 12:50.909
The moment Prospero magically
emerges from the page.

12:50.910 --> 12:53.645
Why are you being so chummy?

12:53.646 --> 12:56.248
I tricked Prospero into
sending me here as his agent.

12:56.249 --> 12:58.584
I want you to help me destroy him.

12:58.585 --> 13:00.285
You've betrayed us in the past.

13:00.286 --> 13:02.621
The future past.
Oh, man, I hate time travel.

13:02.622 --> 13:04.356
I didn't think you
stood a chance before,

13:04.357 --> 13:06.592
but I deduce you're here
for the Staff of Power.

13:06.593 --> 13:08.694
- I have a plan.
- I also have a plan.

13:08.695 --> 13:09.928
We find Shakespeare,

13:09.929 --> 13:11.797
we discover how he
accidentally creates Prospero,

13:11.798 --> 13:13.065
we grab the Staff of Power,

13:13.066 --> 13:15.000
we return to the future where
we defeat Prospero there,

13:15.001 --> 13:16.902
and then we come back with
the Staff of Power and hopefully

13:16.903 --> 13:18.170
don't violate causality.

13:18.171 --> 13:19.872
I have a far simpler plan

13:19.873 --> 13:21.473
and a much more
convincing British accent.

13:21.474 --> 13:23.941
Ooh, two for two. [Pats arm]

13:25.878 --> 13:29.513
â™ª

13:30.949 --> 13:33.851
[Indistinct conversations]

13:36.823 --> 13:38.792
We are still in need of
players for the new work,

13:38.793 --> 13:43.062
and the author shall hear you read.

13:43.063 --> 13:44.330
Oh!

13:44.331 --> 13:47.400
[Giggling]

13:47.401 --> 13:49.402
Oh, my God.

13:49.403 --> 13:52.905
Did you hear that, Eve?
We get to audition as actors.

13:52.906 --> 13:54.807
I am pretty much
guaranteed to get a part,

13:54.808 --> 13:57.342
so that means access to Shakespeare.

13:57.343 --> 13:59.111
And we shouldn't just
try and stop Prospero?

13:59.112 --> 14:01.213
Somebody did. He was
powerless for centuries.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.582
[Whispers] No, we can't risk
that somebody else is meant to.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.853
Say, which do you prefer?
Yay or nay or yay or... nay.

14:06.854 --> 14:09.389
Nay. Good time. Here.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.157
We wait for Prospero
to show up, we get the staff,

14:11.158 --> 14:12.199
take that back to the future.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.332
And we definitely shouldn't
try and kill Shakespeare.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.632
No, absolutely not. Why...

14:15.633 --> 14:18.098
[Screaming]

14:20.964 --> 14:24.366
[Indistinct conversations]

14:27.249 --> 14:28.550
[Screaming]

14:28.551 --> 14:30.051
[Click]

14:30.052 --> 14:32.152
[Clamoring]

14:33.855 --> 14:36.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
He just saved Shakespeare.

14:36.893 --> 14:38.293
Indeed, hold.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.895
The boy speaks the truth.

14:39.896 --> 14:43.954
That gawky fellow has spared my blood

14:43.955 --> 14:46.457
- from foulest murder.
- [Clank]

14:46.458 --> 14:48.859
[Grunts]

14:48.860 --> 14:51.295
A drink for thee. Here.

14:51.296 --> 14:53.631
[Clenching teeth]
Do we violate cause and effect

14:53.632 --> 14:55.265
if we talk to Shakespeare?

14:55.266 --> 14:59.236
I gotta be honest, my whole
plan is very fuzzy right now.

14:59.237 --> 15:02.138
â™ª

15:04.674 --> 15:06.175
He's coming! He's coming!

15:06.176 --> 15:07.844
[Clears throat] He's coming.

15:07.845 --> 15:10.380
[British accent]
Um, art thou all right?

15:10.381 --> 15:12.015
He did not hit me with the bolt.

15:12.016 --> 15:14.717
I suffered a fit some months ago.

15:14.718 --> 15:17.787
But my wits, despite what some may say,

15:17.789 --> 15:22.225
are still sharp enough to
detect your odd accent.

15:22.226 --> 15:27.230
Oh. Uh, I-I thought my
accent was pretty good.

15:27.231 --> 15:28.631
No.

15:28.633 --> 15:29.666
Uh, we're Flemish.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.001
[Clearing throat] From Flanders.

15:32.002 --> 15:35.505
<i>Ja, wij zijn echte kaaskoppen, oh!</i>
(Yes, we are real Dutchmen!)

15:35.506 --> 15:38.241
[Laughing]
[Chuckles]

15:38.242 --> 15:41.477
Of course, yes, I recognize
the cadence now.

15:41.478 --> 15:44.847
Cheers, and drinks for our
friends from Flanders.

15:44.848 --> 15:47.483
ALL: Cheers!

15:47.484 --> 15:53.423
Ah! Good wine is a familiar
creature if it be well used.

15:53.424 --> 15:54.757
"Othello."

15:54.758 --> 15:58.027
A familiar creature
with my work, you are.

15:58.028 --> 16:00.695
You have no idea. You have no idea.

16:01.764 --> 16:06.969
Assassin, why expose yourself
before the king arrives?

16:06.970 --> 16:08.705
King James is coming here?

16:08.706 --> 16:13.376
Indeed, to see the very first
performance of my new play.

16:13.377 --> 16:16.345
- That'll prove it to him...
- Absolutely, William, he will see.

16:16.346 --> 16:19.348
Off me! I'm not so weak.

16:19.349 --> 16:22.018
You two sought an audition with me.

16:22.019 --> 16:23.553
[Stifled laugh]

16:23.554 --> 16:26.689
Come. You've earned it.

16:26.690 --> 16:28.657
[Blusters]

16:31.828 --> 16:34.464
Why didn't you tell me your
plan was to kill Shakespeare?

16:34.465 --> 16:36.199
I thought it was obvious.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.533
Look, Carsen's a fool.

16:37.534 --> 16:39.368
"...was not shaped for sportive tricks,

16:39.369 --> 16:41.003
nor made to court an
amorous looking glass..."

16:41.004 --> 16:42.405
[Sighs]

16:42.406 --> 16:43.906
You need to strike Shakespeare down

16:43.907 --> 16:45.608
the first chance that you get.

16:45.609 --> 16:47.210
[Laughs] And doom the future?

16:47.211 --> 16:50.146
Any future where I may yet
serve another, I'll risk.

16:50.147 --> 16:53.015

16:58.122 --> 17:00.256
I don't know, the letters
are different sizes.

17:00.257 --> 17:01.691
- It's tricky.
- Had to be.

17:01.692 --> 17:03.559
The entire scheme depended on Mr. Carsen

17:03.560 --> 17:04.961
not noticing his own clues.

17:04.962 --> 17:06.996
Third letter, first letter,
second letter, fourth letter...

17:06.997 --> 17:09.332
There's no variation to
the alphanumeric cipher.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.467
I mean, it's unlike any
language I've ever seen.

17:11.468 --> 17:13.169
The Fleveh Collection. Flanders,

17:13.170 --> 17:15.171
the largest collection of
Shakespearean objects

17:15.172 --> 17:16.873
on permanent display.

17:16.874 --> 17:19.776
- <i>"Fleve."</i> Flynn and Eve.
- Ah.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.577
Good. We're on the right track.

17:21.578 --> 17:22.645
You know what it means if they sent

17:22.646 --> 17:25.080
this complicated a message
back through time.

17:25.082 --> 17:27.916
It means they knew they
couldn't bring it with them.

17:27.917 --> 17:30.453
They're not coming back.

17:30.454 --> 17:33.488
Then we do right by them. [Exhales]

Blah, blah, blah, Fortinbras.

18:24.174 --> 18:26.142
Not sure why that's all even in there.

18:26.143 --> 18:28.211
Rather important bit, actually.

18:28.212 --> 18:30.646
[Theatrical accent] More or less,

You Flemish!

19:57.567 --> 20:00.436
You're not just brave,
but jovial. [Laughs]

20:00.437 --> 20:04.140
I must add a Flanders lad
to my next play.

20:04.141 --> 20:06.041
[Chuckles]

20:07.209 --> 20:09.111
[Sighs, mutters]

20:09.112 --> 20:10.846
Where did you get that quill?

20:10.847 --> 20:14.250
Oh, a gift from my friend, John Dee.

20:14.251 --> 20:16.085
The wizard, John Dee?

20:16.086 --> 20:18.988
Wizard? Oh, the tales he tells.

20:18.989 --> 20:23.025
This very quill he swears
is from ancient Arabia,

20:23.026 --> 20:25.695
carved from a branch of
the Tree of Knowledge.

20:25.696 --> 20:27.096
Hogwash.

20:27.097 --> 20:29.465
[Sighs] 'Tis my good luck charm, though.

20:29.466 --> 20:32.301
I've writ every play with it.

20:32.302 --> 20:33.669
[Lowered voice] Now we know why he's

20:33.670 --> 20:36.238
the world's greatest writer...
magic pen, kind of a cheat.

20:36.239 --> 20:37.673
[Lowered voice] Magic
pen wouldn't be enough.

20:37.674 --> 20:39.075
He'd already have to be a genius.

20:39.076 --> 20:40.509
It only boosts his level of writing.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.011
Power, effect, focus.

20:42.012 --> 20:43.679
- Power, focus, effect.
- That's what I meant.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.982
Prospero said he got his Staff of Power

20:45.983 --> 20:47.316
from the Tree of Knowledge.

20:47.317 --> 20:49.018
I've got a bad feeling about this.

20:49.019 --> 20:50.786
[British accent] Uh, William, sir,

20:50.787 --> 20:54.757
would it be possible for us
to just be perhaps extras

20:54.758 --> 20:56.225
in tonight's production?

20:56.226 --> 20:58.828
Oh, afraid not, lad. [Sighs]

20:58.829 --> 21:01.063
Tonight's far too important.

21:01.064 --> 21:04.800
- We play to keep the king's favor.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

21:04.801 --> 21:09.305
The future of the troupe,
my future, depends upon it.

21:09.306 --> 21:13.342
Oh, I'm sure he'll love "The Tempest."

21:13.343 --> 21:16.078
"The Tempest"?
That's not the name.

21:16.079 --> 21:18.980
'Tis "The Triumph of Prospero."

21:20.116 --> 21:24.285
[Under breath]
Very bad feeling about this.

21:27.790 --> 21:30.726
â™ª

21:30.727 --> 21:33.195
Hey.

21:33.196 --> 21:35.831
You know, the legend
states that when England

21:35.832 --> 21:38.234
is in its hour of greatest need,

21:38.235 --> 21:41.003
Arthur will return.

21:41.004 --> 21:44.106
"He who wielded Excalibur before

21:44.107 --> 21:47.877
"shall wield it again,
and save all England."

21:47.878 --> 21:52.814
The idea of seeing my friend
again, after all this time...

21:54.216 --> 21:56.385
But Arthur is long dead.

21:56.386 --> 21:59.622
And as Colonel Baird said,
we are on our own.

21:59.623 --> 22:01.857
Only thieves hide
things in plain sight.

22:01.858 --> 22:05.226
Keep checking the surfaces. There has
to be some kind of... [Door opening]

22:06.762 --> 22:09.030
Hey. Hey!

22:12.735 --> 22:15.538
[Indistinct conversations]

22:15.539 --> 22:19.108
Flynn, he's not gonna just have
the Staff of Power in his props.

22:19.109 --> 22:20.776
He's got a magical pen from John Dee.

22:20.777 --> 22:22.611
Who knows what he could've
picked up in a junk shop?

22:22.612 --> 22:25.014
London is the most
magical city in the world.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.016
A magical artifact in
London is like finding

22:27.017 --> 22:28.417
a toaster at a yard sale.

22:28.418 --> 22:30.553
- You should hear this.
- And to Milan I so return,

22:30.554 --> 22:33.155
with dread art and magicks dire.

22:33.156 --> 22:37.159
To reclaim my throne and
make the world my own.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.761
This is not "The Tempest" I remember.

22:38.762 --> 22:40.863
In this version, Prospero
conquers the world.

22:40.864 --> 22:42.398
It's like he's working
out his issues about

22:42.399 --> 22:43.699
being forced into retirement.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.801
It's like he's trying to
become some kind of, uh...

22:45.802 --> 22:47.303
Magical badass.

22:47.304 --> 22:50.272
I know thou thinks I'm old and feeble,

22:50.273 --> 22:52.942
weak of arm and infirm of mind.

22:52.943 --> 22:55.111
But I am still he who ruled.

22:55.112 --> 22:59.615
I am still the man whose wit
conquered knowledge arcane

22:59.616 --> 23:03.285
- and words ruled courts and kings.
- [Grunts]

23:03.286 --> 23:04.920
Power...

23:04.921 --> 23:06.622
His rage about being
discarded and forgotten.

23:06.623 --> 23:08.591
His wish to be powerful
enough to spite his enemies.

23:08.592 --> 23:10.359
- Focus...
- The magical quill,

23:10.360 --> 23:11.694
the instrument that changes his thoughts

23:11.695 --> 23:14.163
into reality, cut from the
Tree of Knowledge itself.

23:14.164 --> 23:15.231
Effect...

23:15.232 --> 23:17.600
I am still the man whose words remake

23:17.601 --> 23:20.569
the very world before your eyes.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.872
I return triumphant!

23:22.874 --> 23:24.441
Prospero!

23:24.442 --> 23:26.009
[Loud electrical crackle]

23:26.010 --> 23:27.711
[Grunts]

23:27.712 --> 23:30.682
[Screaming]

23:35.219 --> 23:37.016
[Screaming]

23:37.017 --> 23:38.451
- Eve...
- Yes, Flynn?

23:38.452 --> 23:40.453
When I say run from the evil wizard...

23:40.454 --> 23:42.888
- [Whoosh]
- [Braying]

23:42.889 --> 23:44.657
Running from the evil wizard!

23:44.658 --> 23:48.426
- [Braying continues]
- No, no!

23:51.297 --> 23:53.698
[Grunts]

23:56.736 --> 23:59.805
- Aah!
- [Cackling]

23:59.806 --> 24:02.341
- [Screaming continues]
- The witches and the floating dagger.

24:02.342 --> 24:03.447
That's from "Macbeth."

24:03.448 --> 24:05.182
The donkey head, that's
Bottom from "Midsummer's."

24:05.183 --> 24:07.751
Turned a statue, that's,
uh... "Winter's Tale."

24:07.752 --> 24:09.953
Prospero can only do
magic from the plays.

24:09.954 --> 24:12.122
Prospero's a manifestation
of Shakespeare's id.

24:12.123 --> 24:13.891
He's using Shakespeare's imagination.

24:13.892 --> 24:16.626
So it's not so much a
transformation as a possession.

24:16.627 --> 24:19.262
He's being possessed by
one of his own creations.

24:19.263 --> 24:22.031
William, what madness is this?

24:22.032 --> 24:23.666
Not madness, clarity.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.602
My mind, my vision unbound.

24:26.603 --> 24:28.438
King James will be here any moment.

24:28.439 --> 24:30.072
His army marches behind him.

24:30.073 --> 24:32.208
His soldiers will strike you down.

24:32.209 --> 24:36.779
So the king will come
here seeking sanctuary.

24:36.780 --> 24:40.182
I will murder James and
become ruler of all England...

24:40.183 --> 24:41.951
and then the world.

24:41.952 --> 24:45.254
I will not watch you do this.

24:45.255 --> 24:46.622
I grant thy wish.

24:46.623 --> 24:48.491
[Whoosh]
[Screaming]

24:48.492 --> 24:49.725
[Laughing]

24:49.726 --> 24:52.929
[Screaming, sobbing]

24:52.930 --> 24:56.132
Murdering King James is
definitely not part of history.

24:56.133 --> 24:59.201
We're gonna need help,
all the help we can get.

24:59.202 --> 25:01.137
Amazing.

25:01.138 --> 25:03.506
This is the first full
manuscript of "The Tempest."

25:03.507 --> 25:05.274
Handwritten.

25:05.275 --> 25:07.777
This quill... I know this wood.

25:07.778 --> 25:09.345
It's the Tree of Knowledge.

25:09.346 --> 25:13.516
All this hidden here
this entire time? Amazing.

25:13.517 --> 25:16.919
I don't understand what we're...
are we supposed to wear this?

25:16.920 --> 25:19.088
Well, Prospero regained his power

25:19.089 --> 25:21.424
with elements of his story.

25:21.425 --> 25:24.427
And Mr. Carsen has given
us another story.

25:24.428 --> 25:27.430
The manuscript, the
quill, they represent...

25:27.431 --> 25:28.764
Shakespeare.

25:28.765 --> 25:30.299
The donkey head.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.301
Bottom, "Midsummer Night's Dream."

25:32.302 --> 25:36.072
Bloke got turned into a man
with a donkey head by magic.

25:36.073 --> 25:37.473
It was a movie.

25:37.474 --> 25:38.829
- Yes.
- I'd have to be, wouldn't it?

25:38.830 --> 25:40.876
Seems like that would be the reason.

25:40.877 --> 25:42.445
Transformation. Now traditionally,

25:42.446 --> 25:44.880
the magic cloak is worn by Prospero.

25:44.881 --> 25:46.515
Carnations?

25:46.516 --> 25:49.151
That's just weird.
It's not a traditional prop.

25:49.152 --> 25:50.920
Matter of fact, in "Winter's Tale,"

25:50.921 --> 25:53.155
there's a woman who rants
about how much she hates them

25:53.156 --> 25:54.924
because they're unnatural.

25:54.925 --> 25:56.559
Unnatural. How?

25:56.560 --> 25:59.495
Because they're two
things grafted together.

25:59.496 --> 26:04.467
Author transformed by magic,
magician, grafted together.

26:04.468 --> 26:08.170
Out there? That's just not Prospero.

26:08.171 --> 26:09.271
He's Shakespeare.

26:09.272 --> 26:11.707
What we have here are
the ritual elements

26:11.708 --> 26:15.177
of an exorcism.

26:15.178 --> 26:18.414
I think we have a fighting chance.

26:18.415 --> 26:21.516
â™ª

26:27.857 --> 26:29.291
We don't stand a chance.

26:29.292 --> 26:31.661
Well, you certainly
don't, getting yourself

26:31.662 --> 26:32.962
all kerfuffled the way that you have.

26:32.963 --> 26:35.698
I hope you see, Eve, that
he's really not that great.

26:35.699 --> 26:37.767
- I mean, the man is in stocks, and I'm free.
- [Sighs]

26:37.768 --> 26:40.536
The man can't move
and I am free as a bird.

26:40.537 --> 26:41.937
I'm just saying.

26:41.938 --> 26:43.873
Shakespeare has summoned Prospero.

26:43.874 --> 26:45.474
You should've let me kill him.

26:45.475 --> 26:48.511
Actually, Shakespeare
turned <i>into</i> Prospero.

26:48.512 --> 26:50.413
Surprising.

26:50.414 --> 26:52.515
My plan still would've worked, though.

26:52.516 --> 26:55.084
- How 'bout we get me out of these?
- Yes, yes, I'm working on that.

26:55.085 --> 26:57.086
Shakespeare is Prospero. Options.

26:57.087 --> 26:58.421
Well, this explains

26:58.422 --> 26:59.922
Shakespeare's plan in the future.

26:59.923 --> 27:02.091
You see, Shakespeare
was obsessed with forests,

27:02.092 --> 27:05.027
their purity, their happiness.

27:05.028 --> 27:06.529
I was working on it.

27:06.530 --> 27:08.397
This hasn't, uh, changed anything at all.

27:08.398 --> 27:09.565
We just stick to my plan.

27:09.566 --> 27:11.333
- [Lock clinks]
- We get the Staff of Power,

27:11.334 --> 27:13.002
we use it to get back to the future,

27:13.003 --> 27:14.270
and we stop Prospero there.

27:14.271 --> 27:18.708
Odds are if we strike now,
we can still kill him.

27:18.709 --> 27:20.509
Kill him, kill him, kill him,

27:20.510 --> 27:23.512
said the once and future villain.

27:23.513 --> 27:24.780
I'll have you know, sir,

27:24.781 --> 27:26.682
I do not take kindly to such language.

27:26.683 --> 27:30.953
Well, if we kill him here,
we will never meet him there.

27:30.954 --> 27:33.255
- Well, if you... Stop!
- What?

27:33.256 --> 27:35.758
- Stop. Stop.
- Every time. All day.

27:35.759 --> 27:37.093
- Stop.
- All day long!

27:37.094 --> 27:39.695
Stop! Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

27:39.696 --> 27:43.499
Work together or die alone.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.534
Okay.

27:45.535 --> 27:47.136
What's your plan?

27:47.137 --> 27:50.473
Prospero's story ends
with his staff broken

27:50.474 --> 27:52.041
and book drowned, right?

27:52.042 --> 27:53.143
Right.

27:53.144 --> 27:55.779
Well, then that's what we're gonna do.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.029
â™ª

28:00.366 --> 28:02.701
[Thunder rumbling]

28:02.842 --> 28:04.809
- Do you trust him?
- Eh.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.177
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you the most.

28:06.178 --> 28:08.379
Okay, then I'm gonna be honest
and say that I don't think that

28:08.380 --> 28:09.204
even if we get this book,

28:09.205 --> 28:10.435
we're gonna be able to break this staff.

28:10.436 --> 28:12.967
It's gonna take an object
of much greater power.

28:12.968 --> 28:15.001
- How much power?
- Off the top of my head,

28:15.002 --> 28:17.570
I'd say Excalibur, but he's long gone.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.605
You know, there's a story about England

28:19.606 --> 28:21.440
in its greatest time of need...

28:21.441 --> 28:23.509
- PROSPERO: Who's there?!
- Shh, shh, shh.

28:23.510 --> 28:25.811
'Tis I.

28:25.812 --> 28:28.114
Your author knew me.

28:28.115 --> 28:33.185
I-I cannot... remember
what the author did or s...

28:33.186 --> 28:35.054
My... my memories are confused.

28:35.055 --> 28:37.890
I offer you a boon.

28:37.891 --> 28:39.325
[Chuckles]

28:39.326 --> 28:41.227
I am this earth's greatest wizard.

28:41.228 --> 28:43.763
What could <i>you</i> offer me?

28:43.764 --> 28:47.500
I am from the future, sent by you.

28:47.501 --> 28:50.136
I can reveal to you your enemies.

28:50.137 --> 28:52.405
Show you your destiny.

28:52.406 --> 28:56.142
Your great destiny.

28:56.143 --> 28:57.776
Show me.

29:08.754 --> 29:11.089
[Lowered voice] Eve!

29:14.894 --> 29:16.429
Treachery!

29:16.430 --> 29:17.763
[Grunting]

29:17.764 --> 29:19.532
You wish to fly?

29:19.533 --> 29:21.167
[Crackling]

29:21.168 --> 29:24.170
- Ohh! Uhh!
- [Body thuds]

29:24.171 --> 29:27.039
With pen and book once dear to you,

29:27.040 --> 29:29.041
I summon here great Prospero.

29:29.042 --> 29:32.411
â™ª

29:32.412 --> 29:34.712
[Whooshes]

29:37.316 --> 29:39.151
Treachery!

29:39.152 --> 29:40.553
Foolish knight.

29:40.554 --> 29:43.122
You think I would not
sense your weak magics?

29:43.123 --> 29:45.257
[Whooshing]

29:45.258 --> 29:50.463
Ha! You seek to bind me now that
you've given me my true staff?

29:50.464 --> 29:54.433
Not bind you. Expel you.

29:54.434 --> 29:59.472
â™ª

29:59.473 --> 30:01.107
What is this?

30:01.108 --> 30:04.510
What we have here are the
ritual elements of an exorcism.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.079
All the world's a stage,

31:03.969 --> 31:07.573
Don't worry.
This isn't how your story ends.

31:07.574 --> 31:12.244
[Weakly] Flynn, his staff is his pen.

31:12.245 --> 31:16.414
Break it, and you can rewrite the story.

31:18.951 --> 31:22.421

31:22.422 --> 31:25.391
You would break my staff?!

What have you?! Steel? Fists?!

31:30.797 --> 31:38.437

31:38.438 --> 31:40.840
[Weakly] Excalibur.

32:06.266 --> 32:08.801
It's about rejecting death's power.

while you were telling Prospero's story.

Now you hold book and quill

Oh, he's in there somewhere.

But he's just newly born.
Or newly reborn.

33:52.472 --> 33:54.073

33:59.412 --> 34:01.146
It's a paradox portal.

34:01.147 --> 34:02.982
- You're alive.
- Kinda.

34:02.983 --> 34:07.086
Greetings from the far
end of five centuries.

34:07.087 --> 34:10.054
There's a hole in the timeline.
Time's trying to repair itself.

34:10.056 --> 34:11.757
Shakespeare needs to
live out his days here

34:11.757 --> 34:13.359
as history remembers.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.327
Great, Will, you step
through to your time,

34:15.328 --> 34:16.996
we'll step through
to ours, all... all good.

34:16.996 --> 34:19.398
I'm afraid not.

34:19.399 --> 34:23.534
Once Master Shakespeare is back in 1611,

34:23.536 --> 34:26.538
the primary paradox is closed.

34:26.539 --> 34:29.842
Timeline requires that he
live out life in the past,

34:29.842 --> 34:32.944
but it will not allow you to return.

34:34.713 --> 34:37.081
- That's not fair.
- Nobody said it would be.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.884
- So what are we gonna do?
- They already know.

34:43.621 --> 34:45.190
Ride safe.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.692
Check your six.

34:48.726 --> 34:51.563

- No.

34:51.563 --> 34:53.297
Steal something shiny.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.702
Leave it somewhere
interesting for me to find.

34:56.703 --> 34:59.671
Don't ever change, Jones.

34:59.672 --> 35:01.906
Why would I?

35:03.809 --> 35:05.911
I, uh...

35:05.912 --> 35:08.580
still don't like you.

35:08.581 --> 35:10.481
Likewise.

35:12.584 --> 35:14.153
- Don't.
- No. Don't.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.954
Ah, I will figure this out.
I will find...

35:15.955 --> 35:20.359
No, don't live your
life for anybody else.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.660
Go have your own adventure.

35:33.038 --> 35:36.909
He who wielded Excalibur
before shall wield it again

35:36.910 --> 35:38.676
and save all of England.

35:40.345 --> 35:45.417
Mr. Carsen, you wielded Excalibur before.

35:45.418 --> 35:47.919
Very well done, sir.

35:49.421 --> 35:52.157
It was a pleasure, Colonel.

35:52.158 --> 35:54.959
Every moment.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.596
[Clears throat]

36:01.867 --> 36:04.035
[Whooshes]

36:23.885 --> 36:26.488
Thank you very much for
aiding me with this project.

36:26.489 --> 36:29.057
It's important that we know
if the Library has, indeed,

36:29.058 --> 36:30.325
fully returned.

36:30.326 --> 36:31.727
Yeah, well, it's good if I stay busy.

36:31.728 --> 36:33.361
Keeps my mind off things.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.597
Ah. The others?

36:35.598 --> 36:37.599
The others?

36:37.600 --> 36:39.601
Well, Jones is pretending he's fine.

36:39.602 --> 36:43.572
And Cassandra ain't pretending at all.

36:43.573 --> 36:46.541
When the Library...
when it rearranged itself,

36:46.542 --> 36:48.009
it really screwed itself up.

36:48.010 --> 36:49.644
There were rooms that were upside down.

36:49.645 --> 36:51.680
There were three rooms
that changed color.

36:51.681 --> 36:53.548
One room was inside out...

36:53.549 --> 36:55.217
- I...
- Don't ask.

36:55.218 --> 36:57.819
Do you have the, um, do you have
the key to the locked room?

36:57.820 --> 36:59.788
Hmm. There is no key.
It's always been locked.

36:59.789 --> 37:02.691
Mr. Carsen and I have tried
to gained entry many times.

37:02.692 --> 37:07.028
But there's a sign on the door
that says you have the key.

37:07.029 --> 37:11.165
There's no sign on that door.

37:16.271 --> 37:18.172
See?

37:20.342 --> 37:22.110
That has never been visible before.

37:22.111 --> 37:24.012
It's some kind of copper alloy.

37:24.013 --> 37:26.381
Well, oxidation is what
turns copper green.

37:26.382 --> 37:28.350
I mean, the Statue of Liberty
used to be all shiny,

37:28.351 --> 37:29.618
and then it oxidized.

37:29.619 --> 37:31.353
If you hid a message in a copper alloy

37:31.354 --> 37:33.221
that blends itself with
the surrounding metals,

37:33.222 --> 37:36.091
you wouldn't be able to
detect it until it oxidized.

37:36.092 --> 37:37.459
Nice trick!

37:37.460 --> 37:39.795
Time-delay metallurgic cryptography.

37:39.796 --> 37:41.563
Yeah, but that's a lot of time.

37:41.564 --> 37:43.331
Statue of Liberty took
two decades to turn green.

37:43.332 --> 37:45.534
- This must've taken...
- Centuries?

37:45.535 --> 37:49.704
Message from the past, hidden.

37:49.705 --> 37:52.874
Not visible until this very moment.

37:52.875 --> 37:54.409
Sound familiar?

37:54.410 --> 37:57.646
"Jenkins, the key is in
your Guardian's name."

37:57.647 --> 37:59.681
You don't have a Guardian.

37:59.682 --> 38:01.282
Of course I do.

38:03.819 --> 38:05.020
Eve Baird.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.921

38:41.357 --> 38:42.757
Did you miss us?

38:42.758 --> 38:46.595
You guys did time travel
the... long way around.

38:46.596 --> 38:47.863
Inspired, sir.

38:47.864 --> 38:51.700
Well, I kind of have to give
Eve credit for this one.

38:51.701 --> 38:56.004
I'm sorry for you two to be
trapped here in my time.

38:56.005 --> 38:57.672
Look at the bright side.
We saved the world.

38:57.673 --> 39:00.408
They're probably putting
a statue of us up

39:00.409 --> 39:02.309
at the Library.

39:04.379 --> 39:06.181
"A Winter's Tale."

39:06.182 --> 39:08.149
You turned Hermione into a statue.

39:08.150 --> 39:10.051
And... and Prospero did the same thing

39:10.052 --> 39:12.554
- with the quill and the staff.
- We can travel through time?

39:12.555 --> 39:14.522
Eve, anybody could time travel,
just in one direction.

39:14.523 --> 39:17.859
I'll need you to use
your pen one last time.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.028
FLYNN: We created the
spell to open the door,

39:20.029 --> 39:23.498
prepared the plaque as our
alchemical alarm clock,

39:23.499 --> 39:26.134
packed the clues that you would
need to exorcise Prospero.

39:26.135 --> 39:28.803
Then past me wrote future me

39:28.804 --> 39:30.805
the letter I knew I would
discover myself in the future...

39:30.806 --> 39:33.141
or now the past future.

39:33.142 --> 39:35.810
BAIRD: I really hate time travel.

39:35.811 --> 39:37.479
FLYNN: Shakespeare used
his magic pen one last time

39:37.480 --> 39:40.015
writing the story of how
a dashing Librarian

39:40.016 --> 39:44.052
and a gorgeous Guardian were
transformed into a statue

39:44.053 --> 39:48.123
to be awoken by the sound
of Cassandra's voice.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.425
And then he shipped us to the Library

39:50.426 --> 39:52.294
labeled as dangerous artifacts,

39:52.295 --> 39:55.430
along with a letter explaining
how to magically seal us in.

39:55.431 --> 39:59.100
Just your average slice of
incredibly complex causal cake.

39:59.101 --> 40:00.634
Oh. [Giggles]

40:01.603 --> 40:04.005
Did we miss anything?
I mean, other than 400 years.

40:04.006 --> 40:05.840
Dinosaurs are back.

40:05.841 --> 40:07.108
[Laughs]

40:07.109 --> 40:09.077
Wait, really?

40:09.078 --> 40:10.612
[Both laughing]

40:10.613 --> 40:12.681
Jones, magical crime.

40:12.682 --> 40:14.449
Stone, legends, history come to life,

40:14.450 --> 40:15.750
things that go bump in the night.

40:15.751 --> 40:18.720
Cassandra, how science and
math interact with magic.

40:18.721 --> 40:20.488
- Mathemagics.
- Never gonna be a thing.

40:20.489 --> 40:22.090
Give me a theoretical framework.

40:22.091 --> 40:23.858
I want action plans, incident reports,

40:23.859 --> 40:25.393
weekly updates, and cross-references.

40:25.394 --> 40:27.696
You all know what you're capable of.

40:27.697 --> 40:29.530
Let's do this.

40:30.532 --> 40:32.500
Okay, boys, there's still a
lot of rooms in this place

40:32.501 --> 40:33.768
that we haven't checked out.

40:33.769 --> 40:37.172
So I say we set up here and
then my lab can go here.

40:37.173 --> 40:40.241
Finally, permission to
steal anything we want.

40:40.242 --> 40:43.912
This is what you got from that speech?

40:43.913 --> 40:46.147
Subtext, mate.

40:46.148 --> 40:48.717
Come on, come on, that's it.

40:48.718 --> 40:50.652
That's it.

40:50.653 --> 40:52.120
There ya go.

40:52.121 --> 40:54.756
Hey, twice as far as yesterday.

40:54.757 --> 40:57.792
Just took a little time.

40:57.793 --> 40:59.427
Like most things.

40:59.428 --> 41:02.430
What? 400-year-long kiss
wasn't enough time?

41:02.431 --> 41:04.299
[Chuckles]

41:04.300 --> 41:06.701
I was wondering what you
remembered about that.

41:06.702 --> 41:10.839
Well, I was thinking that
if they'd never found us,

41:10.840 --> 41:14.575
kissing you was exactly how
I'd want to spend eternity.

41:24.986 --> 41:26.954
Hmm.

41:28.123 --> 41:31.126
You know, you don't have to run anymore.

41:31.127 --> 41:33.595
No. I mean, unless I'm being chased.

41:33.596 --> 41:35.463
By all the things that are
always trying to kill us.

41:35.464 --> 41:37.365
Countless murderous... many
murderous creatures and myths.

41:37.366 --> 41:38.933
Yes, well, in that case, you should run.

41:38.934 --> 41:41.503
But other than that...

41:41.504 --> 41:43.003
stay a while.

41:47.976 --> 41:50.410
Our Library.

41:52.614 --> 41:54.449
Hmm.

41:54.450 --> 41:55.650
What?

41:55.651 --> 41:57.585
Oh, I was just thinking.

41:57.586 --> 42:01.423
Should that table be round?

42:01.424 --> 42:02.690
