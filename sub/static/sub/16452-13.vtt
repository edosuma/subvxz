00:34.680 --> 00:36.410
Dr. Schafer always
claimed he had --

00:36.420 --> 00:39.980
That was a very dramatic
end to the day's testimony.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.840
But can we summarize,dominick,

00:42.850 --> 00:46.500
The thrust of the defense attorney's
cross of deputy chief johnson?

00:46.510 --> 00:51.420
Because he suggested that the l.a.p.d.
Had provided no physical evidence

00:51.430 --> 00:53.930
That oliver henry's
death was even a homicide.

00:53.940 --> 00:57.140
But henry didn't die by accident.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.930
So as the pathologist,dr.
Morales,pointed out,

01:00.940 --> 01:03.430
"to believe henry wasn't murdered,

01:03.440 --> 01:06.360
"you have to suppose
he committed suicide,

01:06.370 --> 01:08.500
"and to believe that,you have to say,

01:08.510 --> 01:13.390
"'well,oliver henry
purposely ingested versed,'

01:13.400 --> 01:17.470
Which is an anesthetic not
available by prescription."

01:17.480 --> 01:21.230
The kennedy assassination
had less holes in it.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.810
And today we learned about some evidence
that had been previously excluded.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.420
And this was very interesting.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.280
A big deal was made

01:28.290 --> 01:32.840
About the defendant owning
a black bmw convertible

01:32.850 --> 01:37.600
And there having been a black
bmw in the victim's driveway

01:37.610 --> 01:39.180
On the night of the murder.

01:39.190 --> 01:40.730
And now some reporters are saying

01:40.740 --> 01:43.260
That the l.a.p.d. Overreacted again

01:43.270 --> 01:45.120
By arresting dr. Jonathan schafer

01:45.130 --> 01:48.270
For the murder of his wife's
divorce attorney oliver henry.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.160
Have you been following
that case at all?

01:50.170 --> 01:52.440
Just what's been on the news.

01:52.450 --> 01:55.420
I think before we start
using words like "overreact,"

01:55.430 --> 01:56.760
We should really
be looking at --

01:56.770 --> 01:58.170
I think the word "over-react" came up

01:58.180 --> 02:00.610
Because the doctor always
said he had an alibi,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.640
That he'd been on a
boat trip with a friend

02:02.650 --> 02:03.710
During the time of the murder.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.110
And today,that friend showed up.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.960
Well,then we'll hear what the guy has t

02:08.970 --> 02:11.039
But if the police have evidence

02:11.050 --> 02:14.160
Connecting a specific
individual to murder,

02:14.170 --> 02:16.420
Do you want them to
keep it to themselves,

02:16.430 --> 02:19.580
Or do you want to present
that evidence in court

02:19.590 --> 02:21.410
And let the justice system decide?

02:21.420 --> 02:22.660
Let me add something,

02:22.670 --> 02:24.910
That even though deputy chief johnson

02:24.920 --> 02:28.670
Did not get a confession
this time in this case,

02:28.680 --> 02:31.990
I have every confidence that
she made the right arrest

02:32.000 --> 02:34.290
And that she will ultimately prevail.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.080
Could you turn that off,please?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.880
Taylor's throwing you to the wolves.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.660
Or maybe just giving
them a map to your body.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.750
So,tough time in court
this afternoon,huh?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.610
Hey,are you mad at me about something?

02:53.620 --> 02:55.550
I just had a bad day is all.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.400
More like a bad month,honestly.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.280
You know,sometimes,if you're
already having a bad day,

03:05.290 --> 03:08.440
But you got more bad stuff stored up,

03:08.450 --> 03:09.710
You just get it all out at once,

03:09.720 --> 03:11.690
Say everything that's upsetting you.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.190
Make a bad day really horrible

03:13.200 --> 03:16.950
So that tomorrow,it can only be better.

03:23.610 --> 03:26.510
Okay,i can't fix what
i don't know is broken.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.640
You got two d.u.i.s in
one month five years ago

03:31.650 --> 03:32.990
And never told me about it.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.660
I had to find out

03:33.670 --> 03:37.590
While trying to get a multiple-driver
discount from the insurance company.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.590
And i'm really upset.

03:45.610 --> 03:47.570
I see.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.790
Do you have a drinking problem?

03:52.730 --> 03:55.320
I would if i was drinking.

03:56.890 --> 03:58.920
Okay,i'm in...

04:00.250 --> 04:03.880
I joined,right after all of
that,alcoholics anonymous,

04:03.890 --> 04:05.050
And i am taking care of it,

04:05.060 --> 04:07.970
So i don't look at the drinking
thing as an active issue.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.630
How can it not be an
issue? You lied to me.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.660
I lied?

04:11.670 --> 04:15.020
You told me that you were
allergic to alcohol,but the --

04:15.030 --> 04:17.970
I called it an allergy because
that is how i think of it.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.970
How could you not tell
me you were in A.A.?

04:19.980 --> 04:22.990
Do i have to look up the word
"anonymous" for you in the dictionary?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.120
I'm not your friend.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.610
I'm not your coworker.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.200
I'm your fiancee.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.780
And if i'm marrying an alcoholic,

04:28.790 --> 04:30.020
Then i have a right to know about it.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.460
If you were getting married?

04:34.750 --> 04:36.260
I want an explanation.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.760
I want to know why you withheld
this information from me.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.690
Because if i can't trust you...

04:40.700 --> 04:42.810
What?What?

04:42.820 --> 04:43.990
I don't know.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.470
I don't know.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.660
This is bull...

04:49.670 --> 04:51.440
I looked everywhere for this guy,

04:51.450 --> 04:52.600
And he was nowhere to be found.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.150
He shouldn't be too
hard to locate anymore.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.230
He's sitting in one of
your interview rooms,

04:56.240 --> 04:59.550
Where i assume even you can find him.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.700
Unless we can prove this
eugene "topper" barnes

05:01.710 --> 05:03.610
Is lying about dr. Schafer's whereabouts

05:03.620 --> 05:06.500
On the night oliver henry was
murdered,this case is over.

05:06.510 --> 05:08.570
I still have to interview mr. Barnes.

05:08.580 --> 05:09.620
And i have serious doubts

05:09.630 --> 05:12.650
That this alibi of dr.
Schafer's is going to hold up.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.730
Chief pope,i would like to
interview eugene barnes myself.

05:15.740 --> 05:16.880
Really?

05:16.890 --> 05:19.020
Yes,really.

05:19.030 --> 05:21.860
******i'm sick and tired
of getting black eyes

05:21.870 --> 05:22.450
Because of her mistakes!

05:22.460 --> 05:24.990
***do not speak about me
like i'm not in the room.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.090
Okay,hold on,hold on.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.190
Let's say,for the sake
of argument,garnett,

05:28.200 --> 05:30.590
That you do interview this witness

05:30.600 --> 05:32.950
And you actually gain
information useful to this case.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.800
Are you then prepared
to be called to the stand

05:35.810 --> 05:37.450
By schafer's defense attorney

05:37.460 --> 05:39.360
And turn your case over
to another prosecutor?

05:39.370 --> 05:41.830
Because that is,of
course,what could happen.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.290
You are more than welcome,sir,

05:45.300 --> 05:48.690
To observe my interview
in our electronics room.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.640
Chief johnson will even wear an earpiece

05:51.650 --> 05:53.590
So that if you believe
she's missed something,

05:53.600 --> 05:56.550
You can relay your question to her.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.200
Fine.

06:08.650 --> 06:10.490
I'm telling you,chief,he's
the right guy.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.930
I don't care what this
topper barnes guy says.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.600
The jury will care,lieutenant.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.280
They will care very much.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.740
If we can prove

06:17.750 --> 06:20.570
That the defense purposely
held mr. Barnes back from us,

06:20.580 --> 06:21.950
Then maybe we can get a mistrial.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.800
Of course they held him back.

06:22.810 --> 06:23.900
Why else wouldn't they tell us

06:23.910 --> 06:26.390
That topper's real
first name was eugene?

06:27.440 --> 06:29.310
You know the movie?

06:31.300 --> 06:33.020
Lieutenant tao,what do you have for me?

06:33.270 --> 06:35.900
Mr. Eugene,a.k.a.
"topper," barnes' statement

06:35.910 --> 06:37.590
Matches up with what dr. Schafer claims.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.980
They were on a four-day sailing trip.

06:40.450 --> 06:41.760
Topper's
criminal file --

06:41.770 --> 06:44.300
A couple drug busts and an
inconclusive assault charge.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.520
I think that might help.

06:46.530 --> 06:47.630
Yes,it will.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.960
It will very much. Thank you.

06:51.230 --> 06:52.950
Buzz,can i have an earpiece,please?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.350
Yes,ma'am.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.840
Mr. Garnett wants to assist me.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.520
Thank you.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.280
Now,if there is something
that you'd like to know,

07:04.290 --> 07:07.560
Please relay your
question to me quietly.

07:08.390 --> 07:11.080
Thank you so much.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.230
Have a seat.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.690
Mr. Barnes.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.000
Hi.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.760
So,do i have to talk to you guys?

07:26.770 --> 07:29.250
Absolutely not,but
i'd really like to hear

07:29.260 --> 07:31.630
About your sailing
trip with dr. Schafer.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.130
Because there's nothing worse

07:33.140 --> 07:35.600
Than putting the wrong man on
trial,especially for murder,

07:35.610 --> 07:37.770
And around here,we like
to learn from our mistakes.

07:37.780 --> 07:38.390
Yeah?

07:38.400 --> 07:42.070
Well,you guys should be
geniuses,then,all the mistakes you make.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.930
So,i guess you'll hear what
i have to say on monday.

07:48.310 --> 07:49.890
It was nice meeting you.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.100
What's she doing? He can't leave.

07:53.110 --> 07:55.290
You have been under arrest four times

07:55.300 --> 07:57.620
For possession of a
controlled substance...

07:58.130 --> 08:01.880
And that you've been
convicted of drug dealing

08:01.890 --> 08:06.020
And that you have an outstanding
assault charge from two years ago.

08:06.030 --> 08:07.880
I did my time for the dealing,

08:07.890 --> 08:09.340
And that assault charge was dropped.

08:09.350 --> 08:10.570
No,it wasn't.

08:10.580 --> 08:15.980
The victim,a mr. Robert
grimes,refused to press charges.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.560
But mr. Grimes is in prison now.

08:17.570 --> 08:19.600
I bet if i offered to
make his life easier,

08:19.610 --> 08:21.560
He'd help me out by
reinstating the assault charge.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.310
And then you could sit here
and talk with me all night

08:23.320 --> 08:25.190
Because you'd be under arrest.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.810
Or you could sit right back down.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.550
I'm just gonna tell you the same thing

08:29.560 --> 08:31.860
I told jonathan's attorney,mr. Cordry.

08:31.870 --> 08:34.380
It turns out that's
exactly what i want to hear.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.860
Well,all right,darlin'.

08:38.870 --> 08:40.070
What do you want to know?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.510
Where's he been?

08:43.940 --> 08:47.060
Chief,mr. Garnett wants you to
ask mr. Barnes where he's been.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.850
I guess my first question is,

08:48.860 --> 08:53.320
Were you aware that you were withholding
valuable information from a murder trial?

08:53.330 --> 08:54.700
I didn't even know there was a trial.

08:54.710 --> 08:55.870
I was out of the country.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.480
Where?

08:57.490 --> 08:59.050
Really? Where?

08:59.540 --> 09:02.360
Mexico. I got a place,about
50 miles north of cabo.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.590
I spend most of my time down there.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.820
Doing what,exactly? I have a boat.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.570
Yes,we've heard about your
boat -- the super plum.

09:10.590 --> 09:11.870
The sugar plum.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.870
See,that's another mistake we made.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.150
Dr. Schafer must have
gotten the name wrong.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.530
He should take a look at his eye chart.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.020
Would you please just tell her to ask

09:20.030 --> 09:22.220
Why the hell he just
happened to be in town?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.590
Mr. Garnett wants you to ask mr. Barnes

09:24.600 --> 09:27.210
Why the hell he just
happened to be in town.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.750
Sorry.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.050
What's she doing?

09:32.330 --> 09:34.080
What are you doing?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.700
So,tell me,mr. Barnes,

09:36.710 --> 09:39.880
What do you do 50 miles north of cabo?

09:40.290 --> 09:42.490
You know,i got a
little charter business.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.890
I take tourists out fishing.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.780
I don't need much. The drinks are cheap.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.590
And so are the women.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.660
And how do you know dr. Schafer?

09:50.670 --> 09:52.990
From college. We were
in the same fraternity.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.670
So you two were close.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.620
Yeah,we stayed friends,

09:55.630 --> 09:57.100
And every time i come up the coast,

09:57.110 --> 09:58.610
I stop here,i give him a call,

09:58.620 --> 10:01.900
See if he's too successful
to come play with me.

10:01.910 --> 10:03.420
That's what you did the
last time you were in town --

10:03.430 --> 10:05.460
You called him up and
invited him on your boat?

10:05.470 --> 10:08.360
Yeah,we went down to
ensenada for a few days.

10:08.670 --> 10:11.250
Fishing,drinking beer,the usual stuff.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.920
I'm unfamiliar with the usual stuff.

10:12.930 --> 10:14.650
Could you describe it?

10:15.900 --> 10:18.200
You know what? It's your lucky day.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.850
I have video.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.930
That's our trip to ensenada right there.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.210
Next best thing to being there.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.970
Knock yourself out.

10:33.370 --> 10:34.740
***he's still taking line.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.000
I can't put any more drag on him.

10:37.010 --> 10:38.580
Gonna break the line with any more drag.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.820
You go in there to
break schafer's alibi,

10:41.830 --> 10:43.710
You wind up making it stronger.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.250
The real deal. I told you,pal.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.800
I told you.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.670
Chief johnson,i think we
need to accept the fact

10:49.680 --> 10:51.970
That dr. Schafer may be innocent.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.420
I don't.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.160
Lieutenant flynn and provenza,

10:55.170 --> 10:57.570
Follow up,please,on mr. Barnes.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.480
Make sure he really has been
out of the country all this time.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.070
Lieutenant tao and buzz,

11:02.080 --> 11:05.020
I need you to make sure
that this video is genuine.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.810
And detective sanchez,check
out those boats,please.

11:07.820 --> 11:11.030
Find out who --
wait a minute.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.660
What is it,chief?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.770
Who was holding the camera?

11:22.170 --> 11:23.620
Someone was videotaping you.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.730
Oh,um...

11:26.320 --> 11:27.840
You know,when i go out,

11:27.850 --> 11:29.680
I just hire these local
guys right off the dock.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.520
There's a million of them.

11:30.530 --> 11:33.070
This kid's name -- i
don't know -- carlos?

11:33.080 --> 11:35.200
I'd never seen him
before. I paid him cash.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.760
As soon as we docked,he took off.*****

11:37.770 --> 11:39.600
Why didn't dr. Schafer
tell us about carlos?

11:39.610 --> 11:42.170
Two alibi witnesses are better than one.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.200
I don't know. Maybe he
didn't remember his name.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.330
Where is carlos now?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.070
I don't know.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.030
I told you,he took off
as soon as we docked.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.910
You want to go down to cabo?
I'll sail you down there.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.050
We'll go on a carlos
hunt,just you and me.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.640
It could be fun.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.650
You don't even want to say hello.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.720
Hello.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.750
I'm tired,and i have to
go straight back to work,

12:20.760 --> 12:22.580
So now is not a good time.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.910
It's all right...

12:28.370 --> 12:30.200
Because i don't have a lot to say.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.730
I got both the d.u.i.s
you were asking about

12:37.740 --> 12:40.320
In my own car,off the clock.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.030
And after the second one,i
went directly to my office,

12:42.040 --> 12:44.820
I reported what happened
and put myself in rehab,

12:44.830 --> 12:46.940
Which saved my job.

12:46.950 --> 12:49.510
Maybe my life,too.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.470
Is that why elaine divorced you?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.190
The drinking?

12:53.530 --> 12:55.580
Her name is cindy.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.700
My ex-wife's name is cindy. Okay?

12:58.710 --> 13:00.620
I don't even know anyone named elaine.

13:00.630 --> 13:01.770
And cindy is another story.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.200
The reason i never told
you i was an alcoholic

13:05.210 --> 13:07.190
Is because i don't want you
to be concerned or worried

13:07.200 --> 13:09.450
About something that
is basically my problem.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.480
The way i look at
it,that part of my life,

13:11.490 --> 13:14.200
The drunken part,is over.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.200
See,being an alcoholic
is not such a bad thing,

13:18.210 --> 13:20.560
As long as you don't
pour yourself a drink.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.990
Maybe you feel differently about that.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.630
But you have a lot of
nerve,brenda,calling me a liar.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.150
A lot of nerve.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.260
What's that supposed to mean?

13:34.270 --> 13:36.630
It's funny being accused
of being dishonest

13:36.640 --> 13:38.030
By someone who lies all the time.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.370
I do not lie all the time.

13:40.380 --> 13:40.970
- when?
- when

13:40.980 --> 13:41.900
You lie to your parents.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.370
You lie to your parents so much,

13:43.380 --> 13:45.780
We had to have an extra
phone line installed******

13:45.790 --> 13:47.520
So they wouldn't know i was living here.

13:47.530 --> 13:50.190
You lie to pope constantly
about what you do at work.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.010
You lie to me now when you
say you're gonna do something

13:52.020 --> 13:54.690
Like look for a house
when you know you're not!

13:54.700 --> 13:56.370
You lied when you said you'd
put this place on the market.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.350
You promised you'd do
that three months ago.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.140
That is not a
lie. It's just a --

14:01.150 --> 14:03.880
I get busy,that's all.
It's not the same thing!

14:03.890 --> 14:05.300
You know,you're right.
It's not the same thing.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.350
******we have different flaws,brenda,

14:07.360 --> 14:08.510
But i have
been more --

14:08.520 --> 14:10.590
I have been more than patient with yours

14:10.600 --> 14:13.260
Because i am pretty
aware of how bad mine are.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.550
But for you to say that
you don't trust me...

14:17.040 --> 14:20.840
To suggest that our whole
relationship is on the line

14:20.850 --> 14:23.930
Because of mistakes i made
before we started dating,

14:23.940 --> 14:27.410
To throw the word "if" at me
while you're wearing that ring?

14:35.760 --> 14:37.280
Okay.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.880
That's as much of an
explanation as i have right now.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.000
I hope it's enough.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.150
- chief.
- yes

15:13.160 --> 15:14.350
The alibi holds up.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.090
No filters,no layers --
nothing but handheld video.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.170
And the location where
they are in the --

15:20.180 --> 15:20.720
Sorry.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.770
The location where they are in this shot

15:22.780 --> 15:24.660
Is just off the coast
of ensenada,mexico,

15:24.670 --> 15:26.740
Between the hours of 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.,

15:26.750 --> 15:28.780
Pacific standard time,on
the day of the murder.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.350
How can you be so sure?

15:30.360 --> 15:33.040
Do you see that cruise ship
in the background,chief?

15:33.050 --> 15:34.650
That's the pacific western.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.340
It only docks in mexico twice a year.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.190
The fact that it is heading out to sea

15:38.200 --> 15:41.250
Verifies time,date,and location.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.050
It's almost as if dr. Schafer
knew he was gonna need an alibi

15:44.060 --> 15:45.990
When this video was taken.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.300
Oh,and i checked into mr.
Barnes' charter company.

15:50.970 --> 15:52.020
It's for real.

15:52.030 --> 15:54.890
Eugene's boat service,based
out of cabo san lucas,

15:54.900 --> 15:57.020
And it's seasonal,like he said.

15:57.830 --> 15:59.880
Detective daniels,what
do you have for me?

15:59.890 --> 16:01.180
The flarpl.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.260
They're usually issued
when there's a question

16:03.270 --> 16:04.610
Of how the attorney will be paid,

16:04.620 --> 16:07.440
And dr. Schafer is a highly
successful ophthalmologist.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.940
So why would his wife's attorney

16:08.950 --> 16:10.640
Need to put a lien on their house?

16:10.650 --> 16:11.310
I don't know.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.390
I can't explain where the
money from his practice goes.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.170
He doesn't seem to take anything
from his business,really.

16:17.180 --> 16:22.460
I,uh...i feel like i haven't
done my best on this case,

16:22.470 --> 16:24.420
And i don't know why.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.290
I'm sorry.

16:26.300 --> 16:29.600
That's okay.we all make mistakes.

16:30.260 --> 16:31.630
Maybe i...

16:32.260 --> 16:34.640
Maybe i made a really big one.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.060
In fact,the only person
i've run into all week

16:38.070 --> 16:41.250
Who seems to have a good explanation
for everything is dr. Schafer.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.270
All right,um...

16:44.800 --> 16:46.310
Detective daniels,valerie henry said

16:46.320 --> 16:48.690
That the victim's billing
information wasn't privileged,

16:48.700 --> 16:50.860
So see if you can
get ahold of that fl--

16:52.700 --> 16:55.150
Flarpl for me,please.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.210
It's a public document. I
can't get it until monday.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.570
Or mrs. Henry might be able to help us.

17:04.130 --> 17:06.550
I have the financial files.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.880
What would you like to know?

17:07.890 --> 17:10.550
Your husband asked for
and received a flarpl,

17:10.560 --> 17:12.530
But dr. Schafer's a wealthy man.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.520
The judge could have ordered him

17:13.530 --> 17:15.510
To write a check for
his wife's attorney fee.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.839
Yes,usually that's what
ollie would have recommended,

17:17.849 --> 17:19.960
But it turns out,not surprisingly,

17:19.970 --> 17:22.119
Since he was having an affair,

17:22.130 --> 17:24.790
That the schafers' bank
accounts were nearly empty.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.819
So,ollie did a little investigating,

17:26.829 --> 17:29.160
And he found out that the doctor had,

17:29.170 --> 17:34.140
A couple of years ago,put a
lot of money into a second home.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.470
- so,he put a lien on
that - -i-i'm sorry.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.140
A second home?

17:39.050 --> 17:40.890
In l.a.,too.

17:40.900 --> 17:44.950
Very close to his primary
residence.isn't that odd?

17:44.960 --> 17:47.090
And then when dr. Schafer
found out about the lien

17:47.100 --> 17:49.240
On that residence,he
hit the roof --

17:49.250 --> 17:50.490
Threatened ollie.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.700
And your ex-husband told you that?

17:52.710 --> 17:53.940
Oh,no,no.

17:53.950 --> 17:56.050
Ollie took privilege seriously.

17:56.060 --> 17:57.720
He didn't want me to
worry about threats.

17:57.730 --> 17:59.890
No,i was there.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.090
Dr. Schafer came into the office.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.690
And the only other thing i can tell you

18:05.700 --> 18:07.830
Is that mrs. Schafer asked ollie

18:07.840 --> 18:11.530
To take her to this
new house,and he did.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.430
But around that time,

18:13.440 --> 18:16.590
Ollie and i had an argument
about the dogs,and we...

18:19.010 --> 18:21.220
And we never spoke again.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.910
Looks like mrs. Schafer
paid us by a cashier's check

18:26.920 --> 18:31.320
Two days before ollie died
to get the flarpl removed.

18:31.330 --> 18:33.250
And he released the lien?

18:33.260 --> 18:37.050
Well,he probably would have
that monday,but he died...

18:37.420 --> 18:39.430
Or was murdered.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.780
And if he was,then it's my fault,

18:41.790 --> 18:44.150
Because if i hadn't filed
for divorce from ollie,

18:44.160 --> 18:46.410
He never would have been
alone in the house that night,

18:46.420 --> 18:49.180
And he never would have made
it to the bottom of that pool.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.720
And here i am,living with
everything we've ever owned,

18:51.730 --> 18:55.460
And it means nothing
because i don't have him.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.430
If i had
just --

19:00.970 --> 19:02.750
If i...

19:03.410 --> 19:09.430
"if"...is a...very
hard word to live with.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.070
But...

19:13.450 --> 19:15.400
You're living here again.

19:15.410 --> 19:18.230
Your ex-husband never changed his will.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.300
Yes,well...

19:21.630 --> 19:23.450
Yes,i guess...

19:24.190 --> 19:26.860
He was a bit neglectful
of his personal papers.

19:26.870 --> 19:30.520
Or maybe he wanted
you to have this place.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.340
That,in spite of everything...

19:34.550 --> 19:36.480
He still loved you.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.000
Maybe,i guess.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.450
All right.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.880
Dr. Schafer's other property,

19:48.330 --> 19:50.940
The one the flarpl was
issued against,is in westwood.

19:50.950 --> 19:53.470
How is it that we're just
hearing about this property now?

19:53.480 --> 19:57.260
I've been through the schafers'
finances and nothing like this came up.

20:00.980 --> 20:02.770
It wouldn't...

20:02.780 --> 20:05.060
Because it's not in the schafers' name.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.360
It's owned by jonathan
schafer's practice,

20:07.370 --> 20:09.950
Listed as a second clinic.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.550
But it's not in an
area zoned for business.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.000
And the address?

20:14.010 --> 20:17.300
2501 partridge drive.

21:06.710 --> 21:08.270
Lieutenant flynn.

21:08.950 --> 21:10.660
Fancy meeting you here.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.600
Chief,you have no idea.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.470
Chief.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.270
Every room in the house is like this.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.620
There must be close
to 4,000 plants here.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.130
I'm telling you,this much marijuana's

21:31.140 --> 21:32.690
Got to be worth $10 million,$12 million.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.390
And how did following up on
mr.Eugene barnes lead you here?

21:36.400 --> 21:41.800
Well,guess who gets his mail
delivered to 2501 partridge drive.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.670
Utility bills.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.420
Bet they use an awful lot of
electricity to run all of this equipment.

21:50.430 --> 21:55.590
And,gee,I wonder what mr.Barnes
uses his boat for in the off-season.

21:57.890 --> 21:59.940
Oh,for heaven sakes.

22:02.130 --> 22:03.780
Schafer,is your husband home?

22:03.950 --> 22:05.220
What is this about?

22:05.230 --> 22:06.900
I have a search warrant.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.060
What the hell is going on here?

22:08.070 --> 22:10.300
An arrest warrant for
you,sir.Jonathan schafer,

22:10.310 --> 22:13.590
you are under arrest for the cultivation
of and possession to sell marijuana.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.240
You have the right to
remain silent*******

22:16.250 --> 22:17.470
Jonathan,What is going on?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.130
Call cordry.Have him meet me downtown.

22:19.140 --> 22:19.890
Daddy!

22:19.900 --> 22:20.750
It's okay,honey.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.050
******

22:22.060 --> 22:24.040
- Did you understand****?
- Yes.

22:24.050 --> 22:26.070
Kristen,have cordry meet me!

22:26.080 --> 22:28.510
Honey,go to your room right now.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.280
Lieutenants flynn
and provenza --

22:30.290 --> 22:31.790
arrest mr.Topper barnes?

22:31.800 --> 22:32.980
If you would,please.

22:32.990 --> 22:34.810
Our pleasure,chief.

22:49.890 --> 22:50.740
No,thanks.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.570
sit down.sit down.Let's just sit down.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.780
The best thing to do
is not to say anything.

22:58.190 --> 23:01.250
Mr.Cordry,dr.Schafer,topper.

23:01.260 --> 23:04.090
Your actions today are those
of a desperate individual.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.180
First,you arrest the
wrong man for the murder,

23:06.190 --> 23:08.690
then you compound that error
by arresting topper barnes.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.420
Sir,are you aware that dr.Schafer here

23:11.430 --> 23:16.960
owns a house containing 4,000 marijuana
plants worth approximately $12 million?

23:16.970 --> 23:18.720
He's an agricultural tycoon.

23:21.140 --> 23:24.370
Schafer's going back to jail without
bond.He's gonna stay there,too.

23:24.380 --> 23:29.560
Let his jerk lawyer explain why his client is
entering the courtroom through the prison door.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.590
And your other
client,mr.Barnes,was his gardener.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
So it seems to me that you
have a very big problem --

23:34.610 --> 23:35.980
he's an ophthalmologist.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.340
Medical marijuana is
legal in california.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.880
They use it for glaucoma and cataracts.

23:40.890 --> 23:45.460
Well,judging by the amount of pot you have on
hand,sir,you must be bracing for an epidemic.

23:45.770 --> 23:47.410
Sergeant gabriel,let's
get garnett in here.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.890
I believe we have our motive.

23:48.900 --> 23:54.240
Dr.Schafer here may have set you up by having you
register the utilities at his house in your name.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.350
Maybe he'll claim you
were renting the place.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.460
Don't listen to her.Allow me
to excuse your ignorance,ma'am,

23:59.470 --> 24:02.220
by pointing out that medical
marijuana is available by prescrip--

24:02.230 --> 24:03.900
jonathan,let me handle this.

24:03.910 --> 24:08.340
Just because my client owns a house in which
marijuana was cultivated does not make him a killer.

24:08.350 --> 24:11.580
And none of this,by the way,is
admissible in the current trial.

24:11.590 --> 24:14.020
The fact that the victim put
a lien on your client's house,

24:14.030 --> 24:18.540
a house containing over $12 million in
marijuana,just might be of interest to the judge.

24:18.550 --> 24:19.930
Well,we'll see about that.

24:19.940 --> 24:21.500
Wait a second.

24:22.150 --> 24:24.320
- Take it back a few frames.
- Yeah,I saw it,too.

24:24.740 --> 24:26.020
Right about...

24:26.030 --> 24:28.040
stop.*******

24:28.050 --> 24:30.020
Let me enhance this.

24:33.420 --> 24:36.080
Doesn't look like a carlos to me.

24:36.090 --> 24:38.210
Who's that in the
reflection?Do we know her?

24:38.220 --> 24:41.430
Yeah.That's schafer's ex-girlfriend.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.250
Though I'm beginning to
doubt about how ex she is.

24:44.260 --> 24:47.430
A direct violation of
their constitutional rights.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.620
So,I'm not under arrest,or
-- or do I need a lawyer?

24:53.630 --> 24:57.040
No,you are not under arrest,and
you don't need a lawyer.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.940
Because,fortunately,for you,lying
to the police is not against the law.

25:00.950 --> 25:03.640
We just wanted to
straighten a few things out.

25:03.650 --> 25:07.650
Have you tell us the truth this
time,since we already know most of it.

25:09.650 --> 25:10.970
How about that?

25:10.980 --> 25:13.180
Have a seat,if you would,please.

25:13.620 --> 25:18.490
Well,but I -- I knew
jonathan was innocent.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.330
And he promised me...

25:21.890 --> 25:23.830
that you'd figure that out in the end.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.910
Then why not tell us that you were on the
boat with dr.Schafer from the very beginning?

25:26.920 --> 25:30.680
You could have been his alibi when
we couldn't find topper barnes.

25:30.690 --> 25:34.540
Jonathan asked me not to say anything
about being on the boat with him.

25:34.550 --> 25:36.730
He thought my getting wrapped
up in a murder investigation,

25:36.740 --> 25:39.800
that it would hurt my
career -- the scandal.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.220
We all know how horrible scandal
is for an aspiring actress' career.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.670
No.

25:46.910 --> 25:50.850
No,I don't think that jonathan schafer
was trying to protect you,michelle.

25:50.860 --> 25:51.880
At all.

25:51.890 --> 25:54.590
He was,though.He was.And he's innocent.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.870
He was with me when that
attorney was murdered.

25:56.880 --> 26:01.570
If you were on the boat,how come you're
not in the video,other than the reflection?

26:01.990 --> 26:05.780
Jonathan told me to just hold the
camera and not say anything,which was...

26:05.790 --> 26:09.340
fine with me -- anything to keep
the relationship going,I guess.

26:09.890 --> 26:13.380
I mean,the whole weekend
was a surprise,anyway.

26:13.390 --> 26:14.570
A surprise?

26:14.580 --> 26:15.420
Yeah.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.470
I found out that morning when
jonathan showed up at my apartment.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.940
He told me to pack,and
then we went to the marina.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.910
In your car?

26:25.920 --> 26:28.750
- No,jonathan took me - 
- are you sure?

26:29.170 --> 26:32.860
Jonathan picked you up
and took you to the marina?

26:34.210 --> 26:36.490
Uh-huh --
marina del rey.

26:37.850 --> 26:40.750
Okay.Thank you,michelle.

26:43.090 --> 26:44.380
Okay.

26:44.390 --> 26:47.130
Did I clear things up for you,then?

26:47.140 --> 26:49.310
Yes,you certainly did.

26:51.490 --> 26:53.440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:03.290 --> 27:07.130
Chief,we received the security photos from
the marina parking lot,and we got a match.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.520
Lieutenant tao has them
in the electronics room.

27:09.940 --> 27:10.960
Thank you,detective.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.230
You're not trying to do anything!

27:13.240 --> 27:14.780
Ma'am,you need to calm down.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.140
Don't tell me to calm down!

27:16.150 --> 27:20.510
I have been sitting here for over
two hours waiting to talk to somebody!

27:20.520 --> 27:22.450
Well,I am just that
somebody.How can I help you?

27:22.460 --> 27:24.480
I went to post bail for my husband,

27:24.490 --> 27:28.430
and I was told that you and that horrible
district attorney requested no bond?

27:28.440 --> 27:31.690
That's true.I was hoping
I could explain things.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.710
The judge already decided that my
husband was not a flight risk,so --

27:34.720 --> 27:36.070
but that was for the murder.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.660
That was before the court knew about
the $12 million worth of marijuana

27:39.670 --> 27:41.780
grown at your husband's westwood house.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.320
Now his flight-risk status has changed.

27:44.330 --> 27:48.820
So,sergeant gabriel,would you please escort
mrs.Schafer to the electronics room?Thank you

27:48.830 --> 27:50.940
I'll be right there to
straighten things out.

27:50.950 --> 27:52.660
This way,please.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.660
Thank you.

27:58.630 --> 28:00.120
Mr.Garnett.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.480
Perfect timing.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.790
Deputy chief johnson,is it true?

28:03.800 --> 28:05.180
Is what true,sir?

28:05.190 --> 28:08.480
Did you place michelle edwards on the
same boat as dr.Schafer the weekend

28:08.490 --> 28:10.340
he's supposed to have murdered mr.Henry?

28:10.350 --> 28:12.170
Well,yes,it is.

28:12.180 --> 28:13.570
Congratulations.

28:13.580 --> 28:17.950
You've confirmed the alibi of the defendant,as well
as the two people most likely to have assisted him.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.470
Honestly,I've come to believe
this case should be dismissed

28:22.480 --> 28:23.850
because you arrested the wrong man.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.900
I have not arrested the wrong man.

28:25.910 --> 28:29.430
And before you dismiss the charges,you
might want to hear the confession.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.930
Besides,I need you to make a deal.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.900
A confession?

28:32.910 --> 28:33.980
Are you crazy?

28:33.990 --> 28:35.440
Cordry's never gonna
let schafer talk to you.

28:35.450 --> 28:38.080
Do you want to win your case or not?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.250
Come with me,sir.

28:44.430 --> 28:48.000
Mrs.Schafer,I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

28:48.010 --> 28:50.110
Would you like a tissue or something?

28:50.120 --> 28:53.390
No,I just -- I just
want my husband home.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.490
And I have to
-- I have to go.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.270
I couldn't find a sitter,and
my daughter,beverly,

28:58.280 --> 29:00.910
she's been home alone
for over two hours now.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.930
Well,let me relieve your
mind about one thing...

29:03.940 --> 29:06.830
because beverly's here with us.

29:09.650 --> 29:12.480
And we are keeping her very safe.

29:12.490 --> 29:14.610
What is beverly...

29:15.450 --> 29:17.630
what are you doing with my daughter?

29:17.640 --> 29:19.700
We're just asking her a few questions.

29:19.710 --> 29:23.810
Tell me,ma'am,do you ever
borrow your husband's car?

29:27.090 --> 29:28.600
- No.
- Really?

29:28.610 --> 29:31.990
Because beverly remembers
things differently.

29:32.010 --> 29:37.690
She says that jonathan drove your car to the
marina the weekend oliver henry was killed.

29:37.700 --> 29:42.380
These pictures were taken from a
parking-lot security camera in marina del rey

29:42.390 --> 29:45.180
two days before your
attorney was murdered.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.620
This is your car entering the lot,yes?

29:51.630 --> 29:54.310
The vanity plates say mrs.Eyes.

29:56.260 --> 30:01.570
Same security camera four days
later -- your car exiting the lot.

30:01.580 --> 30:04.590
And it clearly shows your
husband paying the cashier.

30:04.600 --> 30:09.190
So,if jonathan was driving your car,the
question is,which car were you driving?

30:10.140 --> 30:13.340
Or maybe it's like beverly says...

30:13.630 --> 30:16.180
mommy was driving daddy's car.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.200
What's -- what's
going on here?

30:24.420 --> 30:27.950
Mrs.Schafer filed for divorce
with a fine,upstanding attorney --

30:27.960 --> 30:31.060
a decent guy,a former eagle scout.

30:31.070 --> 30:35.090
And he went after her husband,trying to find
where he might have hidden his resources.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.600
And he discovered a second residence.

30:36.610 --> 30:40.790
And what did you
find,mrs.Schafer,at that second home?

30:41.420 --> 30:42.990
You know.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.390
I mean,you know already.

30:47.060 --> 30:51.730
I thought that we were doing so well
because jonathan was a great doctor.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.820
I had no idea that our money
was coming from selling drugs.

30:56.830 --> 30:59.060
And mr.Henry said,this is great.

30:59.070 --> 31:00.670
Your husband's involved
in a criminal enterprise.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.480
You're gonna get sole
custody of your daughter,

31:02.490 --> 31:06.480
and after the government confiscates his
property,you'll get everything that's left.

31:06.490 --> 31:10.960
But everything didn't turn out
to be so much,did it,mrs.Schafer?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.690
Oh,my god.They did it together.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.330
I -- just --
sergeant gabriel.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.480
Kristen schafer,you have
the right to remain silent.

31:17.490 --> 31:20.500
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.130
You have the right to an attorney.

31:22.140 --> 31:25.950
If you cannot afford an attorney,one
will be appointed by the court.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.730
Mrs.Schafer,do you
understand your rights?

31:30.740 --> 31:33.130
I understand.I don'T...

31:33.140 --> 31:35.430
know if I want to say anything.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.090
Before you invoke your right to
counsel,I want to offer you something,

31:39.100 --> 31:41.220
if mr.Garnett will agree.

31:41.230 --> 31:45.650
Because without your
testimony on monday,

31:45.660 --> 31:48.710
your husband is gonna
be found not guilty,

31:48.720 --> 31:51.190
and you,unfortunately,will
end up on death row.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.090
- No!
- So...

31:53.580 --> 31:57.170
you have a choice to make
tonight,between life and death,

31:57.180 --> 32:00.630
for you or your husband,and I want you to
take a look at your daughter on the monitor.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.430
No!

32:01.440 --> 32:04.110
Because if you tell me the truth...

32:04.430 --> 32:08.460
well,you might miss beverly
growing up and getting married.

32:08.470 --> 32:12.590
But there is a chance that you could hold
your grandchildren in your arms one day.

32:15.090 --> 32:16.610
So,she killed henry.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.580
- She murdered her own attorney?
- It wasn't her idea.

32:18.590 --> 32:19.510
It was her husband'S.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.740
He planned it,and he
gave her the versed.*****

32:22.750 --> 32:23.750
Why would she do that?

32:23.760 --> 32:29.730
Because when mrs.Schafer went 
to give mr.Henry a cashier's check 
so he would release the lien,

32:29.740 --> 32:32.590
he told her that he was
obligated to call the police.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.030
And the millions of dollars that

32:34.040 --> 32:38.140
she expected to get from her divorce
settlement just disappeared,didn't it?

32:38.150 --> 32:39.880
There would be no
alimony,no child --

32:39.890 --> 32:43.020
no,jonathan and I were
not getting a divorce!

32:43.030 --> 32:44.380
We made up.

32:44.390 --> 32:48.100
I paid mr.Henry what I owed him,and
that is the end of the story.

32:48.110 --> 32:52.020
You can't prove anything
against jonathan.

32:52.030 --> 32:54.030
Without your testimony,that's
probably true.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.710
But i can prove that you
murdered oliver henry.

32:56.720 --> 33:00.250
And after your husband is acquitted,I
fully expect him to testify against you.

33:00.260 --> 33:02.910
He won't.And,anyway,he can't.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.850
Spouses can't testify
against each other.

33:04.860 --> 33:08.820
Except in cases of conspiracy
to commit murder...ma'am.

33:08.830 --> 33:12.010
That's a pretty big exception,one
you can count on me to exploit.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.030
Call me.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.020
And I'll plead the 5th.

33:16.030 --> 33:19.800
And jonathan will never say
a word against me.Not a word.

33:19.810 --> 33:21.480
Oh,I think he might.

33:21.490 --> 33:25.230
Have you ever seen your
husband's alibi video?

33:27.220 --> 33:29.350
Have a seat,ma'am.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.580
I'm sorry,ma'am.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.690
Looks to me like your
husband had a guest on board.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.060
She look at all familiar to you?

34:05.660 --> 34:07.330
What do you want me to say?

34:07.340 --> 34:10.460
Was killing mr.Henry your
idea or your husband's?

34:16.130 --> 34:18.360
It was Jonathan's.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.300
Second-degree
murder,possibility of parole,

34:24.310 --> 34:27.420
if you tell the truth at your
husband's trial on monday.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.880
And for jonathan?

34:36.620 --> 34:39.300
You'll go for the death penalty.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.350
I'll definitely ask.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.679
Jonathan threatened Oliver,

34:45.690 --> 34:48.530
and he made sure that
people knew about it.

34:48.870 --> 34:50.610
And then he left town.

34:50.620 --> 34:55.409
He even took my car so that I could use
his to go over to mr.Henry's that night,

34:55.420 --> 34:57.930
so if people ended up
thinking it was a murder,

34:57.940 --> 35:00.510
they'd believe that jonathan
had been there himself.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.730
He'd be a prime suspect...

35:03.120 --> 35:06.750
with a rock-solid alibi...

35:07.080 --> 35:11.810
while you,who have no reason to want
oliver henry dead,would murder him.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.670
Yes.

35:16.930 --> 35:19.120
How did you do this?

35:21.650 --> 35:26.760
I went to mr.Henry's
house,slightly hysterical about

35:26.770 --> 35:29.650
how I was going to
live without any money,

35:30.080 --> 35:34.270
and I had the versed
my husband had given me.

35:35.180 --> 35:40.820
Mr.Henry offered me a drink to
calm down,and he had one,too.

35:41.690 --> 35:43.240
And then...

35:44.910 --> 35:50.720
I called mr.Henry from my husband's
cell,which I had in my purse.

35:50.730 --> 35:54.090
And when mr.Henry got
up to answer his phone...

35:59.920 --> 36:02.750
I put the versed in his drink...

36:02.760 --> 36:05.750
just like jonathan told me to do.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.020
I tried to get him up and outside.

36:09.030 --> 36:14.310
I carried him part of the
way,balancing him on my shoulder.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.820
But he was heavy,and...

36:18.790 --> 36:24.180
he fell,first to his knees,and then...

36:26.240 --> 36:30.670
I dropped him,and he hit his head.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.390
And then I dragged him
the rest of the way.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.440
And did you push him into the pool?

36:39.640 --> 36:42.020
Yes.

36:43.890 --> 36:46.390
Did he struggle to get out?

36:46.400 --> 36:47.940
No.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.370
Why,mrs.Schafer?Why did
you do this terrible thing?

36:55.870 --> 36:58.810
Because jonathan said that I had to.

37:01.040 --> 37:04.450
My husband told me that
we would lose everything

37:05.440 --> 37:08.630
and go to jail if we didn't do it,and...

37:09.260 --> 37:12.230
that if I would just trust him...

37:14.080 --> 37:16.500
we could go back to the life...

37:17.090 --> 37:19.330
we used to have.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.190
Thank you,mrs.Schafer.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.430
Your witness.

37:46.540 --> 37:52.740
Your honor,we request a recess of 
one hour in which to consider how 
to respond to this testimony.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.190
Take two hours,counselor.

37:57.540 --> 38:01.580
This court will recess
until 3:00 this afternoon.

38:27.140 --> 38:27.980
The bubbly!

38:27.990 --> 38:29.480
Sergeant.You're gonna have to skip me.

38:29.490 --> 38:32.110
I'm gonna stick with my
usual cranberry and soda.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.220
No champagne?

38:33.230 --> 38:34.900
Here,take a look at this.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.720
I wear this all the time.

38:36.730 --> 38:38.600
10 years in A.A.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.290
You're kidding.

38:40.300 --> 38:45.570
Well,you see,chief,when I used to drink,I
could be a little bit of an asshole.

38:45.580 --> 38:47.760
Imagine that,if you can.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.760
Sergeant,just a little for me.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.360
If I drink too much,women
take advantage of me.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.920
Give me my ring.

39:01.290 --> 39:03.480
Just a drop.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.490
I got a serious headache.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.130
You guys are so full of
it.This is good stuff.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.760
Here,pour me their shares.

39:09.770 --> 39:12.520
Drink up,lieutenant.I'll
give you a ride.

39:12.530 --> 39:15.050
Well,in that case,pour
me flynn's share,too.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.770
Fine with me,baby.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.110
And one for the chief.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.150
Thank you.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.240
Okay,we're all ready.

39:25.250 --> 39:27.120
Sergeant gabriel,you
should make the toast.

39:27.130 --> 39:31.360
It'll be good practice in case he ever 
decides on a career where public speaking 
is necessary.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.440
- Sergeant!
- Let's go.Sergeant!

39:35.100 --> 39:36.390
- Let's go
- Come on,sergeant.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.570
Don't hold back.We
know you're a suck-up.

39:39.130 --> 39:41.530
Ah,yes,thank
you,lieutenant.That's very helpful.

39:43.090 --> 39:46.200
okay...uh...for...

39:46.750 --> 39:51.320
keeping the team together
despite some pretty hefty pressure

39:52.140 --> 39:54.610
and for...

39:54.620 --> 39:58.840
trusting her instincts,about
us,too,by the way.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.240
And,uh...

40:01.250 --> 40:06.240
for how she always works
so hard to get her man.

40:07.390 --> 40:08.940
I say,hail to the chief.

40:08.950 --> 40:10.580
Chief!

40:14.370 --> 40:16.510
Well,that
was some --

40:18.330 --> 40:21.210
Well,y'all are a little bit like...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.770
a little like my own...

40:24.780 --> 40:26.550
oh,for heaven sakes.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.460
Thank you and right
back at you,all of you.

40:30.570 --> 40:31.560
- Cheers!
- Salud.

40:31.570 --> 40:33.510
- Cheers!
- Salud.

40:33.950 --> 40:36.110
Salud!

40:36.950 --> 40:38.850
Now,gabriel,send the rest
of thabottle over here.

40:38.860 --> 40:40.100
- Yes,of course
- Thank you

40:40.110 --> 40:42.260
I've got me a ride home.

41:09.350 --> 41:12.260
Gary doesn't lie novak stopped by.

41:14.650 --> 41:17.810
Apparently,you put the
house on the market.

41:18.090 --> 41:20.640
Well,you have to do that to sell it...

41:21.230 --> 41:23.010
apparently.

41:23.370 --> 41:26.870
Though,where we'll go
after that,I have no idea,

41:26.880 --> 41:29.820
since we haven't been able to
find anything we can afford.

41:30.730 --> 41:36.550
And,honestly,the idea of strangers 
walking around my stuff bothers the 
living daylights out of me.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.460
And I thought I said that we would wait

41:41.470 --> 41:46.770
and sell this place after we found
something else and were moved out,but...

41:48.740 --> 41:51.060
I guess that's not what I said.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.380
I'm sorry we fought.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.950
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about the drinking.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.990
And I'm sorry.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.130
I'm sorry I said all that about you.

42:30.850 --> 42:33.160
No.No.

42:38.260 --> 42:42.450
I'm not always straightforward.
You were right about that.

42:43.850 --> 42:45.720
And I don'T...

42:45.730 --> 42:48.960
always know the right thing to say,so...

42:48.970 --> 42:52.740
I say the thing I know the
other person wants to hear.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.700
It's an occupational hazard.

43:02.570 --> 43:06.360
And I miss chocolate so much.

43:09.290 --> 43:12.990
I just think I'm going crazy every
time I pass a vending machine.

43:13.420 --> 43:18.830
It's a physical thing.It's a very...

43:20.080 --> 43:22.850
very physical
reaction I have --

43:23.150 --> 43:25.790
so physical that sometimes...

43:26.450 --> 43:28.580
I don't know what to do.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.880
It's possible...

43:32.440 --> 43:35.550
I could help you with
that...if you want.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.500
I don't know...

43:41.940 --> 43:43.600
'cause I want a...

43:44.430 --> 43:49.580
ho ho in the worst way possible.

43:50.020 --> 43:52.040
I don't have a ho ho.

43:53.200 --> 43:57.770
But I do happen to have...

44:02.270 --> 44:04.550
sugar-free...

44:08.590 --> 44:09.960
that's not sugar-free.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.491
Now you're lying again.
