09:14.500 --> 09:16.410
But mostly,
we had each other's back.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.110
Now let's move on to medicine.
We have a busy day ahead of us.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.280
Let me know if there's anything
in the marketing department...

09:22.310 --> 09:23.310
(WHISPERS): Look busy.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.380
RENATA:
...the upcoding system.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.220
BARB:
Don't forget testing.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.980
A well-insured patient
should be tested

09:28.020 --> 09:29.750
for all possible outcomes,
no matter how unlikely.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.920
Dr. Hawkins,
have you met Barb Olsen?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.390
She's our billing consultant.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.430
Here for two weeks to help
Chastain become more efficient.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.260
(LAUGHS): Of course. The bike shorts.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.130
Yeah, I already saw you at my
presentation... well, briefly.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.270
I got paged.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.470
Didn't I get paged?

09:47.470 --> 09:48.840
I didn't hear anything.

09:50.970 --> 09:52.780
Well, nice meeting you.

09:52.810 --> 09:54.940
Barb, there's, um...

09:54.980 --> 09:58.250
Payback. For making me sit
in that presentation.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.150
What's your problem?

10:00.180 --> 10:02.350
A strong kid like you...
can't you go any faster?

10:02.390 --> 10:03.790
I got a life to lead.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.120
Hey, Louisa, how's my man
Rosenthal treating you?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.790
Like the daughter he never had.

10:07.820 --> 10:08.860
A nightmare.

10:08.890 --> 10:09.960
The Chastain softball team

10:09.990 --> 10:11.800
crushed Emory yesterday.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.860
Yeah, we did. (GRUNTS)

10:13.900 --> 10:15.970
Is your back
still bothering you?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.970
Uh, yeah, it's no big deal.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.800
Now I'm thinking it's
a pinched nerve, lumbar spine.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.470
Pain that, uh, radiates along
the affected nerve.

10:23.510 --> 10:25.540
That's impressive, but you're
not quite a doctor yet.

10:25.570 --> 10:27.180
- Let me have a look.
- Uh, maybe later.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.850
I told Joey in Ped Onc
I'd take him to the play area.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.950
Man, that munchkin is cute.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.470
I'm too young for kidney stones.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.570
I'm thinking
it's just a gas bubble.

10:56.610 --> 10:57.710
It's really no big deal.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.040
How long have you been
short of breath?

11:00.080 --> 11:01.340
Just a few days.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.510
I was thinking
it was from the pain.

11:03.550 --> 11:06.520
Your lungs sound congested.

11:06.550 --> 11:08.850
We need a full workup.

11:08.890 --> 11:10.050
This could be serious.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.020
No, I'm okay. I swear.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.520
I can't be sick,
they'll send me back home.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.730
And I need every dime
to make ends meet.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.030
And a CT scan as well.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.860
MRI's probably
the better option.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.600
Actually, maybe we should
check her insurance first.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.270
- Uh, can this wait?
- No.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.930
Can I a moment
with the patient, please?

11:24.970 --> 11:27.340
We're conducting an exam here.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.940
Dr. Hawkins, the administration
has given me license

11:29.970 --> 11:32.510
to inspect all
hospital finances.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.880
You're a subcontractor
to the hospital, right?

11:34.910 --> 11:36.550
Yes. Is this really necessary?

11:36.580 --> 11:38.410
I'm feeling better. I just want
to go home.

11:38.450 --> 11:39.880
Rest up.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.550
She wants to go home. Great.

11:41.580 --> 11:44.050
She can't. She needs an MRI.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.560
Do you know if your company
will cover an MRI?

11:46.590 --> 11:48.930
Does anyone know that stuff?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.390
Then if it doesn't, an X-ray

to burden the hospital.

Well, it's a little late
for that,

Yeah, that's kind of
how it works.

Most consistent with...

18:30.390 --> 18:31.490
A retroperitoneal sarcoma.

18:31.530 --> 18:33.930
Which would explain
the fluid in her heart.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.470
She lied to us. And to her employer.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
She didn't run away because
she doesn't have insurance,

18:38.530 --> 18:41.740
she ran away because she's
an undocumented immigrant.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.310
She has a highly
aggressive tumour.

18:49.350 --> 18:51.980
If she doesn't get surgery
right away, she dies.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.450
No more tests,

18:56.490 --> 18:58.520
no more treatment on our dime.

18:58.550 --> 19:00.490
This hospital isn't a charity.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.540
I felt this was important enough
to bring to the CEO's office

19:15.570 --> 19:17.010
right away.
Ms. Rodriguez is an uninsured,

19:17.040 --> 19:18.340
undocumented immigrant.

19:18.370 --> 19:20.840
She has no family
in this country.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.150
She was brought here
from El Salvador as a child.

19:23.180 --> 19:26.180
No one can take her
once she leaves the hospital.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.650
State rules are clear on this.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.920
Ms. Rodriguez cannot be released
into her own care.

19:31.950 --> 19:33.360
That means Chastain
would be stuck with her

19:33.390 --> 19:34.820
for a long time.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.760
She'd be living here
at our expense.

19:38.790 --> 19:40.060
She would be a Perma Patient.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.700
Not every CEO knows that term.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.600
Claire is not your average CEO.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.600
Dr. Bell, what's her prognosis?

19:45.630 --> 19:47.700
Well, the five-to ten-year
survival rate is excellent

19:47.740 --> 19:51.040
if we operate right away, but...

19:51.070 --> 19:52.610
the longer we wait,
the worse her odds.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.380
And if her surgery is
successful, what's the rehab?

19:55.410 --> 19:58.710
Six months to a year.

19:58.750 --> 20:02.080
Okay, best-case scenario,

20:02.120 --> 20:04.520
what is Louisa's care
gonna cost us?

20:04.550 --> 20:07.360
Chastain does the surgery,
it goes well, post-op,

20:07.390 --> 20:09.460
she can walk with a physical
therapist down the hall...

20:09.490 --> 20:11.190
half a million dollars.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.530
And worst case?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.200
Post-op, Ms. Rodriguez can't
even get out of the bed...

20:16.230 --> 20:17.800
two million dollars.

20:28.910 --> 20:32.480
Hang in there, your count is
moving in the right direction.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.820

20:33.850 --> 20:36.920
Hey, Conrad. How are you?

20:36.950 --> 20:39.560
I'd like to call you in
for an oncology consult.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.790
Okay. Who's the patient?

20:41.820 --> 20:45.090
Louisa Rodriquez, transport
worker here at Chastain.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.500
Good person. She's uninsured

20:46.530 --> 20:49.100
and an undocumented immigrant.

20:49.130 --> 20:51.900
Um, a full course
of radiation and chemotherapy

20:51.930 --> 20:53.340
is, uh, very expensive.

20:53.370 --> 20:55.170
I understand,
but don't you have a foundation

20:55.200 --> 20:57.140
- for cases like this?
- Yes, I do,

20:57.170 --> 21:00.280
but it's not
for the undocumented.

21:00.310 --> 21:01.410
Look, I'll make some inquiries,

21:01.440 --> 21:03.080
but I can't make any promises.

21:03.110 --> 21:05.350
- That'd be fantastic.
- Conrad.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.520

Louisa's surgery

21:07.550 --> 21:10.920

- Lane...

21:10.950 --> 21:13.790

- I'll see what I can do.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.030
I forgot to tell you I saw Lily earlier.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.430
She didn't look good.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.600
Nic, she has cancer.

21:21.630 --> 21:23.000
I know we've been through this,

21:23.030 --> 21:25.670
and I'm sure Lane had every
reason to discharge Lily,

21:25.700 --> 21:29.610
- but my instincts are...
- Lane will take care of her.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.680
Lily's in good hands.

21:36.310 --> 21:37.980

21:41.050 --> 21:42.720
I'm actually really busy
right now.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.890
Okay, but I don't think
the nurses are getting the hang

21:44.920 --> 21:48.060
of the upcoding system
and the multiple-test vectors.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.630

on such short notice.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.850

22:43.880 --> 22:46.950
We have a patient,
uninsured, undocumented,

22:46.980 --> 22:49.450
with a retroperitoneal sarcoma.

22:49.490 --> 22:51.290
Possible six months
to a year rehab.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.690
Given our fixed costs per bed,

22:53.720 --> 22:56.590
this patient represents a
considerable burden on Chastain.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.260
As they would
for Atlanta General.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.800
Yes, but Atlanta General and
Our Lady of Mercy's fixed costs

23:00.830 --> 23:02.200
are much lower than ours.

23:02.230 --> 23:05.230

this patient off our hands,

23:08.970 --> 23:12.740
we'll pay a fee,

If you can funnel us five

23:17.280 --> 23:20.050

we'll consider it.

29:21.140 --> 29:24.680
I fell in love with the OR.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.610
I love it.

29:27.650 --> 29:29.950
Still.

29:29.990 --> 29:33.920
But the money
has to come from somewhere.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.620
If we treat Louisa,
our other patients will suffer.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.460
Services will be cut.

29:38.490 --> 29:40.960
Hours, staff.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.660
You know, I don't like the idea
of putting a price tag

29:42.700 --> 29:44.330
on a life any more than you do.

29:44.370 --> 29:47.600
But the system
doesn't run on air.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.940
No matter how much
we love Louisa,

29:49.970 --> 29:51.470
her price tag

29:51.510 --> 29:54.980
is not two million dollars.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.050
Don't say anything.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.090
Nothing.

30:05.127 --> 29:11.807
(SIGHS)

30:11.830 --> 30:12.900
Catch you at a bad time?

30:12.930 --> 30:14.460
I'd like to shove CUTE
right up her...

30:14.500 --> 30:15.560
Throw it in the trash.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.760
You'll feel better.

30:20.270 --> 30:21.400
Look at that.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.070
Stress management.

30:23.110 --> 30:25.140
I'm guessing you didn't
come up here

30:25.170 --> 30:27.140
to talk to me about upcoding.

30:27.180 --> 30:28.510
No.

30:28.540 --> 30:29.680
It's about your boy, Conrad.

30:29.710 --> 30:31.810
Look, he's taking things hard.

30:31.850 --> 30:33.320
If he doesn't start
to choose his battles,

30:33.350 --> 30:34.420
he's gonna burn out.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.490
Yeah, well,
I can't control Conrad.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.650
Never could.

30:39.690 --> 30:41.820
And he's not my boy.

30:41.860 --> 30:44.090
Not anymore.

30:44.130 --> 30:47.100
Sorry to hear that.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.240
Alabama Shakes is playing
Terminal West next week.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.500
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

30:55.540 --> 30:56.870
I got an extra ticket.

30:56.910 --> 30:58.710
I remember you saying
you liked their music.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.280
I do.

31:02.880 --> 31:03.850
It's not a date.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.710
- (LAUGHS SOFTLY)
- Just a concert.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.050
Have a little fun.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.750

- CONRAD: Blood pressure?
- DEVON: 70/40.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.230
- Cycling right now.
- Her IV blew in the MRI.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.560
We haven't been able
to get another line since.

31:18.590 --> 31:19.630
She's bleeding internally.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.430
Now it's 60/30.

31:23.270 --> 31:24.970
She's a hard stick.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.870
Her vessels are clamped down,
she's too volume-depleted.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.870
Emergency IO.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.610
Yeah, I've never
done that before.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.640
Get the kit.

31:32.670 --> 31:33.840
You're doing it now.

31:38.106 --> 31:39.598
(DRILL WHIRRING)

31:39.610 --> 31:41.250
Push the needle in.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.550
Once you hit the bone, drill.

31:49.090 --> 31:51.090
Keep it steady.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.770
Drill.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.470
Okay, release.

32:08.210 --> 32:09.640
Flush.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.490
We're in the clear.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.790
- For now.
- DEVON: She'll keep bleeding

32:23.830 --> 32:25.960
until we get her to surgery.

32:25.990 --> 32:27.630
There are four
oncology surgeons on call.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.430
Why can't we ask one of them
to do the operation?

32:30.470 --> 32:31.930
Good idea.
Let's practice that.

32:31.970 --> 32:33.040
I'll be Dr. Hillis.

32:33.070 --> 32:34.370
Go ahead, pitch me the surgery.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.670
Hi, Dr. Hillis,
I need a surgical oncologist

32:37.710 --> 32:39.840
to operate on a patient
right away.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.110
Okay, sure, who's the patient?

32:41.140 --> 32:42.140
Louisa Rodriguez.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.880
(GRUNTS) Actually, I forgot.

32:43.910 --> 32:46.210
I'm booked solid today.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.550
Ask Dr. Miller.

32:47.580 --> 32:49.480
Dr. Miller,
I need an oncology surgeon...

32:49.520 --> 32:51.520
Would love to,
but I'm headed to Aruba today

32:51.550 --> 32:52.720
with my fiancée.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.190
Dr. Singh says the failure rate

32:54.220 --> 32:55.690
for this surgery
is through the roof.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.820
Dr. Weiss heard
the administration

32:56.860 --> 32:57.990
is dead set against it...

32:58.030 --> 32:59.960
- The administration is wrong.
- Maybe they are,

32:59.990 --> 33:02.460
but Dr. Weiss makes 400K a year,
really wants to keep his job.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.300
Okay.

33:05.330 --> 33:08.540
They're gonna wiggle their way
out of it any way they can.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.270
But we know someone dying
to do the operation.

33:13.780 --> 33:16.140
CONRAD: But it's not
in your speciality.

33:16.180 --> 33:19.150
So? I'm arrogant enough
to believe I can do it.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.380
And I'm your only option.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.880
Just get an attending
to sign off.

33:23.390 --> 33:25.850
CONRAD: I need you to sign off
on a surgery.

33:25.890 --> 33:28.190
It's not in your speciality.
You'll just be supervising.

33:28.220 --> 33:29.720
Yeah, and what's the catch?

33:29.760 --> 33:31.360
No catch.

33:31.390 --> 33:35.160
Look, I know you, pal.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.660
What rules am I gonna break?

33:36.700 --> 33:38.730
Not breaking. Bending.

33:38.770 --> 33:40.170
Bending, okay.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.110
- Who's the patient?
- Louisa Rodriguez.

33:46.370 --> 33:48.580
Oh, I'm in.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.380
Surgery's a go. Mina's on deck.

33:54.420 --> 33:55.620
Conrad, someone
called Immigration.

33:55.650 --> 33:56.750
They're coming for Louisa.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.730
How can I help you, gentlemen?

34:10.770 --> 34:12.270
- Sir, you need to move aside.
- CONRAD: I will,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.639
if you tell me what's going on.

34:13.670 --> 34:15.370
DEVON:
Hospitals are sensitive areas,

34:15.400 --> 34:16.570

Well then, you better drag us

Mr. Reynolds, do you know
how an MRI works?

It has incredibly
powerful magnets.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.710
Magnets that will rip

36:52.260 --> 36:53.730
