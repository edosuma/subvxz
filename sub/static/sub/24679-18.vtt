00:13.146 --> 00:14.955
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.325
It's freezing in here.
They didn't fix the heat?

00:17.384 --> 00:19.921
Mmm-mmm. Called the super this morning.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.326
Calling doesn't do any good.
I'll go down and talk to him.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.298
Hey, where's Sami?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.265
Did you let him go out?

00:29.329 --> 00:31.366
He doesn't do what I tell him.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.340
You let him bring that in here?

00:41.008 --> 00:43.648
Rico, don't make trouble, please!

00:53.820 --> 00:56.801
If he comes in here, I'll
send him straight home.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.158
Okay.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.699
Hey, hey!

01:02.095 --> 01:03.130
Where's Sami, huh?

01:03.196 --> 01:05.642
- I don't know anything.
- You don't anything!. Then why
you running, huh?

01:05.699 --> 01:06.700
- I don't know!
- Where you going off in a rush?

01:06.767 --> 01:07.837
You don't know? Listen,

01:07.901 --> 01:10.006
you tell your friends Sami's out of this.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.481
If he isn't home in una hora,

01:11.538 --> 01:13.745
I'm gonna call the cops and let
them know what you're up to.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.845
- Listen, I don't know...
- Listen, you tell your friends what I said!

01:23.150 --> 01:26.461
Hey. Hey, get away from me! Help, help!

01:38.632 --> 01:40.942
We heard you were looking for Sami.

01:51.478 --> 01:54.186
You got your pops to
thank for this, little man.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.291
Look at him, little man.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.522
Look at the love in his eyes.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.990
He loves you so much.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.942
Welcome death, little man.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.345
Look, the senator's bill's never
gonna make it out of committee.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.153
No, it's dead, gone, forget it.

02:22.442 --> 02:23.819
Oh, my God!

02:26.079 --> 02:28.218
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:29.216 --> 02:30.718
I didn't see him.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.791
I didn't see him. He came out of nowhere.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.765
I didn't even see him. Oh, my God.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.650
Witnesses confirm the initial report.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.708
This guy ran out into traffic.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.685
This accident finished something
someone else started.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.591
His throat's been cut. It's not very deep.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.528
Didn't go through the carotid artery.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.858
There's dirt in the wound, in his mouth.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.793
He's even aspirated some up his nose.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.098
And there's dirt under the nails.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.038
This man was buried alive.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.242
He... He dug himself out.

03:55.435 --> 03:58.473
This blood spatter on his pants,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.681
you see how it moves across both legs?

04:02.008 --> 04:03.612
It didn't come from his neck.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.324
I didn't see any other wounds.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.123
There's another injured out there.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.719
Out there, somewhere in Prospect Park.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.758
Guys, we're gonna have to
check this whole perimeter.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.670
Oh, damn.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.236
This is Detective Eames. We have a body.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.804
Male, juvenile,

04:31.705 --> 04:34.447
about 50 yards in from the playground.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.682
He was cut right through the carotid.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.655
The boy died instantly.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.096
And there's no mistake this time.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.101
We ran the prints. We got a
pop on the adult victim.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.034
Enrique Iberra.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.868
According to the blood tests,
the kid's probably his.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.965
I'm guessing Iberra's priors were for dope.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.601
This MO's got dope written all over it.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.373
Iberra's last conviction was 12 years ago.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.009
He finished his GED while he was inside.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.143
His parole reviews are stellar.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.285
He had car grease on his
jacket, calluses on his hand.

05:11.344 --> 05:14.052
He was a mechanic. He was
working for a living.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.561
He and his kid were what, witnesses?
Wrong place, wrong time?

05:17.617 --> 05:18.755
Or it's punitive.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.129
Someone was being taught a lesson.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.358
The father?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.961
Not necessarily.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.865
Iberra had his son's blood on his pants.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.838
His son was buried on top of him.

05:29.196 --> 05:32.177
Which means Iberra was likely killed first.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.071
Right in front of his son.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.019
Was your husband in any kind of trouble?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.146
Did he owe someone money or...

05:44.211 --> 05:46.122
No. There was no trouble.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.626
Not about Sami?

05:52.986 --> 05:56.195
No. No.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.661
When Sami didn't come home last night,

06:01.728 --> 06:03.833
you weren't worried?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.044
I thought he was with Rico.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.309
And Rico came home after work,

06:10.370 --> 06:14.375
he left his toolbox there

06:16.209 --> 06:18.416
and then he left again. Why?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.225
To have a beer.

06:24.484 --> 06:27.931
But Sami was 12 years old. He
didn't take Sami to have a beer.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.156
No.

06:31.124 --> 06:35.402
Sami, he was with his friends,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.441
kids from the neighborhood.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.844
Maybe your husband went out looking for him.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.510
No. He just went out... That's all, he...

06:48.842 --> 06:50.981
I'm just so upset. I'm sorry.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.952
We're gonna have to look in Sami's room.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.635
Sami was a fan.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.199
Him and his friends,

07:07.260 --> 07:09.262
they all wanna be basketball players.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.468
Your husband took him to the games?

07:11.531 --> 07:13.408
No, we can't afford that.

07:13.466 --> 07:17.505
These are ticket stubs from 3 different games.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.550
The last one was a month ago.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.645
Someone from Rico's work got him those.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.157
A rich guy. Rico worked on his car.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.056
I don't remember his name.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.193
These protein bars,

07:36.756 --> 07:38.258
did you buy them?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.069
Sure, I did.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.465
How much did they cost?

07:42.796 --> 07:47.142
I... A dollar something. I don't remember.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.407
These are worth about $5, right?

07:50.470 --> 07:54.509
I mean, these are about $5 bucks.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.746
Did someone give them to Sami?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.348
Maybe the same person who
gave him the game tickets.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.152
No, I told you.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.395
I can't help you. Please.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.564
We think you need our help.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.201
Promise you'll give us a call, okay?

08:12.258 --> 08:14.636
Did Sami work on cars with his Dad?

08:15.128 --> 08:17.938
I'm wondering if this
stuff's grease or oil here.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.873
See?

08:25.205 --> 08:28.550
Rico's work. Grease everywhere in the house.

08:28.608 --> 08:32.953
It's okay, I'll clean it up. It's no big deal.

08:40.653 --> 08:44.157
You should really listen to
what my partner is telling you.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.102
You're not alone.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.275
Protein bars, Knicks tickets,
this kid had expensive tastes.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.381
Yeah, and the money to indulge them.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.489
Move it over to the right, okay, because
that's where the drum kit goes.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.089
Where you been?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.858
We got a booking in 20 minutes.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.398
Yeah, sorry, Jojo.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.898
- You know I count on you, right?
- Yeah.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.904
And after, Tomas needs help with his homework.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.572
What? You know the rules.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.912
You wanna hang out, eat
my food, learn the board,

09:31.971 --> 09:33.848
then you gotta get the homework done.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.685
Frankie.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.130
You create a problem,
solve it on your own time.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.927
Let's go.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.971
Dead? Both of them? I didn't know.

09:57.464 --> 10:00.001
Enrique's wife said you saw him last night.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.969
Why would she say that?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.743
Maybe because he said he
was having a beer with you.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.880
No way he told her that.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.211
I was still here, right here,
working â€˜til 9:00.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.957
How do you know it was before
9:00 when he went out?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.156
Well, you just said that...

10:17.217 --> 10:19.629
She didn't tell you what
time it was, Mr. Ramirez.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.259
Now you know because you saw him, right?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.393
Maybe somebody told me they saw him.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.800
Somebody who?

10:25.992 --> 10:29.405
Somebody from where Enrique was
having the beer, like Louisa said.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.636
Where would that be, you being
Enrique's drinking buddy?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.477
Try La Taverna around the corner.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.508
Hey, I wasn't that close to him.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.616
He'd been in jail, you know?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.886
See that bodega down there on the right?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.357
I think the guy there,
Ramirez, was friends with him.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.449
Maybe he saw him.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.190
But you're sure Mr. Iberra didn't
come in for a beer last night?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.959
Yeah. He hardly ever came in.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.693
I don't know, maybe once, I don't know.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.894
I never noticed him. Sorry.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.940
Honest people, every last one of them.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.533
You can tell 'cause they're such bad liars.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.409
Hey, guys. Hey, no, no, wait up, wait up.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.847
Listen, me and my partner, we need your help.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.414
Did you know that a friend of
yours from the neighborhood,

11:20.480 --> 11:23.893
Sami Iberra, you know that he got
killed last night with his...

11:23.950 --> 11:26.123
We don't know him. We
don't know what happened.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.166
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not finished.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.601
Who put the word out not to talk to us?

11:32.759 --> 11:34.534
Who's everyone afraid of?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.435
Come on, Sami grew up here

11:37.497 --> 11:39.670
all his life with his Mom and his Dad.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.806
Huh? You guys grew up with him.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.779
You probably went to the same school, right?

11:43.836 --> 11:46.817
You played video games, you shoot hoops.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.145
You don't think you should stand up for him?

11:53.580 --> 11:57.050
In this neighborhood, the
Neighborhood Watch watches the cops.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.293
It just breaks my heart.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.435
Sami was one of our small victories.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.468
He worked so hard to better his grades.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.769
This year it all just clicked in for him.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.173
How was he outside of class?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.234
Any problems with the other kids? Fights?

12:14.300 --> 12:18.214
No. He stuck mostly with kids
from his own neighborhood.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.409
They're all good kids.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.712
That's the picture we're getting.

12:20.773 --> 12:24.243
The local precinct said it's a low
crime area, very little drug activity.

12:24.510 --> 12:28.048
Protein bars seem to be the drug of choice.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.185
All of Sami's friends eat those.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.557
If you had to name Sami's best
friend, who would that be?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.364
It was Jamal Dupuis,

12:35.421 --> 12:38.265
but Jamal moved out of state a few
months ago to live with his father.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.769
How did Sami take that?

12:39.826 --> 12:42.602
He started acting out, but he
got himself under control.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.438
CD player. Noise reduction headphones.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.304
It's got to be at least
a couple hundred bucks.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.977
That's Rap. Rap.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.851
Well, this is interesting.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.526
What is that, a mambo?

13:05.585 --> 13:08.156
No, it's Son. It's music from Cuba.

13:09.555 --> 13:13.196
Which is odd 'cause his family's Dominican.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.263
These kids are usually ferocious about,

13:17.263 --> 13:19.539
you know, embracing their ethnic background.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.108
It's homemade. Sami's Mix.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.173
And he didn't have a computer
or a CD burner at home.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.214
Sixteen-One Studios.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.888
Yeah, I showed Sami how to download
tracks and use the CD burner.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.588
- You a friend of the family?
- A friend of the community.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.658
The local kids, they like
to stop by after school,

13:41.721 --> 13:44.565
I let them hang out till their
parents come home from work.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.433
But that can't be good for business.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.405
Hey, don't worry. When J. Lo comes
in, I make sure the kids behave.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.301
Let me help you with that.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.203
We'll move it around this way.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.508
All right.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.847
You know, Sami's...

13:59.105 --> 14:02.484
he had a very eclectic selection on his CD.

14:03.443 --> 14:07.721
Yeah, rap, hip-hop, you'd expect
that. But Son music?

14:07.980 --> 14:09.653
Is that your influence, Mr. Rios?

14:09.716 --> 14:11.718
He heard me play it. He liked it.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.855
Kids are like, you know, sponges.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.229
He see you eat these?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.930
He had some in his locker at school.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.967
Well, I can't help it if they get
hungry, and I don't feed them junk.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.872
I mean, you eat junk, you become junk.

14:24.931 --> 14:28.071
Yeah, respect your body, respect
yourself. That's a good philosophy.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.906
I'm sorry, this thing is just so...

14:32.538 --> 14:33.915
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

14:34.774 --> 14:36.310
Oh, I like that.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.190
It records a word or a phrase so you
can play it like a note, you know.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.124
You let the kids use this stuff?

14:43.182 --> 14:45.355
I teach them how to use the equipment,

14:45.418 --> 14:47.022
after they do their homework.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.690
Jojo's clubhouse.

14:48.755 --> 14:49.995
All due respect, ma'am,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.694
where would you like these boys to be?

14:51.758 --> 14:54.534
Here, doing their schoolwork,
maybe learning a skill,

14:54.827 --> 14:57.137
or out in your neighborhood
boosting car stereos?

14:57.196 --> 14:58.834
No, here, definitely.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.842
Hey, Frankie, Ruthie's Jerk
Palace is coming in at 4:00, huh?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.472
You want to set up the board?

15:05.171 --> 15:07.014
I got a restaurant commercial to do.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.979
You must do a lot of these commercials
to pay for all this gear.

15:12.044 --> 15:16.390
Oh, commercials, demos. I even got a
couple of clients get on the Latin charts.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.697
Is Frankie one of your success stories?

15:20.119 --> 15:22.258
Frankie's like an apprentice, you know?

15:22.321 --> 15:25.268
Another couple of years, he'll know
enough to open his own studio.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.601
So he gets his own studio,
and then there's Sami.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.207
What happened with him?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.875
He was a victim of his father's impulses.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.876
The man was an ex-convict.
That was his nature.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.183
He was probably mixed up
with some bad people,

15:43.242 --> 15:44.550
and the poor kid paid the price.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.184
You know, one last thing,

15:47.780 --> 15:51.023
before we let you get on with
your, you know, commercial.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.090
Jamal Dupuis,

15:54.921 --> 15:57.197
did he hang out here with Sami?

15:57.256 --> 16:01.068
Yeah, for a while. But I think the
kid moved out of the neighborhood.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.138
That's what we heard.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.044
Well, thanks.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.771
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Baby!

16:08.835 --> 16:11.748
I really like... I really like that.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.783
Jamal moved down to the barrier islands,

16:19.378 --> 16:21.790
to live with his father in South Carolina.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.850
Why? Was he having problems here?

16:23.916 --> 16:28.058
He wanted to work, and they don't
let 13-year-olds work up here.

16:29.355 --> 16:33.360
So, they say you can make good
money crabbing down there.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.129
Have you talked to him lately?

16:35.194 --> 16:37.936
He calls from time to time from pay phones.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.411
His father doesn't have a phone now.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.310
Have you told him what
happened to his friend Sami?

16:44.570 --> 16:45.571
No.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.413
Well, they were best friends.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.353
They hung out together at the
sound studio on Bergen Street.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.782
We have nothing to say against Mr. Rios.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.526
Your daughter is very cute.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.464
You're happy Jamal's out of the house.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.105
Why would you say that?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.137
Well, you don't have any photos of him.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.442
What's the town where Jamal's
staying with his father?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.076
It's not just one town.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.189
Well, his father's got family on
a lot of the islands down there,

17:26.378 --> 17:28.222
so Jamal stays with them, too.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.762
My favorite place down there
is Gullah Gullah Island.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.628
I bet Jamal probably goes crabbing there.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.497
Oh, yes. I remember him telling me that.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.333
Telling you that he went crabbing
on Gullah Gullah Island?

17:44.196 --> 17:49.077
You know, Mrs. Dupuis, there
is no island with that name.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.641
Well, I'm sure I heard of it.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.916
That's because

17:59.679 --> 18:02.785
there's a children's television
show called Gullah, Gullah Island,

18:02.848 --> 18:06.295
and you probably watched it with
him when he was growing up.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.905
Where is he?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.603
What happened to him?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.807
He's with his father, and you have to go now.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.509
Mr. Dupuis, we can protect your family.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.680
Just go.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.861
Slowly, now. You don't
need that much, just half.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.798
Easy, easy.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.033
You see, Ramon?

18:46.092 --> 18:48.663
One drop at a time, not all at
once like you did last week.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.798
No, I didn't.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.398
Don't contradict!

18:55.635 --> 18:58.013
A man who sees his own
shortcomings and corrects them

18:58.070 --> 18:59.879
is on his way to meet God.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.844
Frankie, come help teach these boys.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.825
Your mind isn't here.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.388
You wanna be strong, you stay focused.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.126
You watch Bennie. He's focused.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.065
That's how he gets the job done.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.831
I got the job done, Jojo.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.203
Half done. Now I told you, watch Bennie.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.448
You see, Frankie? That's focus.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.121
Jamal's parents were supposed to contact us

19:45.184 --> 19:46.891
to tell us where to send his school records,

19:46.952 --> 19:48.329
but we never heard from them.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.993
Jamal ever talk about working
in South Carolina?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.593
No, I never heard that.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.729
Could we see other files from students

19:54.794 --> 19:57.240
who moved away in the last year or so?

19:57.296 --> 19:59.242
Sure. We keep them over here.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.306
There's a notation in Jamal's
records from the school nurse.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.746
Two weeks before he moved,

20:04.804 --> 20:08.843
he showed up with a black eye
and a broken collar bone.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.015
Here you go.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.890
This one moved to Fresno, California.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.298
The school board confirms he's enrolled there.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.598
Here, Christopher White,
broken arm six months ago.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.267
3 weeks later, his parents
say he moved to Oklahoma

20:31.664 --> 20:33.200
to live with relatives.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.777
There's no confirmation in the file.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.308
We try to stay on top of things.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.380
Marco Reyes.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.250
His parents say they sent him to
Mexico to live with his grandmother.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.256
That was a week after he showed up for class

20:46.312 --> 20:48.314
with eight stitches in his face.

20:48.647 --> 20:52.094
These kids were all getting a
beating as a going-away present.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.864
Well, they have something else in common.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.870
They were all from the same 12-block radius.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.939
The same 12 scared blocks.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.046
Some kids were trolling
for scrap metal last October

21:11.103 --> 21:13.481
along I-95 near exit 43.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.644
Their dog started digging.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.318
John Doe, 12 to 13 years old.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.421
He matches one of the set of
dental records you sent around.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.217
Christopher White.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.656
The throat was cut.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.665
The laceration was deep, all
the way back to the vertebra.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.723
Almost took his head clean off.

21:31.223 --> 21:34.568
The way the body was posed in the grave,

21:34.627 --> 21:39.235
stretched out, hands crossed
over the front, feet together.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.171
A proper burial.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.207
A sign of respect?

21:45.337 --> 21:47.749
I'm looking at Christopher
White's birth certificate.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.050
His body was dumped less than a
mile from where he was born.

21:56.282 --> 21:59.855
And these spots on the
shoe, anyone test them?

22:05.257 --> 22:08.033
Other than coloring and tanning agents,

22:08.093 --> 22:09.731
all you got here is shoe leather.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.605
No trace of anything that would cause
it to crack and discolor like that.

22:12.665 --> 22:17.171
Yeah. You know, when I was a
kid, I had leather mitts,

22:17.236 --> 22:19.147
all right, and then they would get cracked,

22:19.205 --> 22:21.685
you know, when they were wet and cold.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.243
Well, that's how leather
reacts when it's frozen.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.756
What about flash frozen?

22:27.913 --> 22:29.415
Sure, with dry ice.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.017
But that leaves a residue.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.895
Liquid nitrogen?

22:35.254 --> 22:36.289
Sure.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.329
It evaporates, leaves no residue.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.376
Look, I

22:48.400 --> 22:50.607
was wondering if you could run
this through your machine.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.377
I wiped it off the floor of a kid's bedroom.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.610
Is that grease?

22:56.575 --> 22:57.952
You tell me.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.218
Submicron Teflon chips. Graphite.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.261
Rare polymers. Friction modifiers.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.323
I'm afraid to ask you where
you put this kind of grease.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.662
It's Italian racing bicycle grease.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.633
It's $30 a tube.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.561
I can imagine what the bicycles cost.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.099
Up to $15,000.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.544
If the Iberra kid had a bike
like this in his bedroom,

23:25.504 --> 23:27.541
it had to be stolen. That's what he was into.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.643
Yeah, that's what they're all into.

23:29.708 --> 23:34.248
The kid in New Jersey, he dripped
liquid nitrogen on his shoe.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.455
Liquid nitrogen is used
to break bicycle locks.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.393
I pulled some figures from Compstat.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.727
There are $3 million worth of bicycles stolen

23:41.787 --> 23:43.460
in all five boroughs every year.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.729
Most of it involves adult perps,

23:45.791 --> 23:49.170
but there are reports of one gang
of kids operating in Manhattan.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.366
They're quick, they use different MO's

23:51.430 --> 23:53.034
and they've never been caught.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.769
And they're all well-trained.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.439
Like Jojo said, kids are like sponges.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.414
And I assume the ones that
don't make the grade

23:59.471 --> 24:01.041
or make trouble get their throats cut.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.813
We matched up 3 of the missing boys,

24:02.875 --> 24:05.549
including Jamal Dupuis, with John Doe remains.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.615
Their parents have been contacted,
but they're still not talking.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.957
Let's be careful how much we lean on them.

24:11.016 --> 24:14.486
According to the direction
of the marks on the vertebrae,

24:14.553 --> 24:18.626
these kids had their throats slit from behind

24:19.725 --> 24:22.228
from left to right.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.967
The killer was right-handed.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.737
But Sami Iberra and his father

24:26.799 --> 24:30.645
had their throat cut from right to left.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.206
Their killer was left-handed.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.721
Jojo was breaking in someone new?

24:41.447 --> 24:44.360
Somebody who didn't quite do the job right.

24:46.118 --> 24:49.759
That's a Cielo with a set of record
10 shifters. Bennie got that.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.735
Good work, Bennie. Real good work.

24:53.292 --> 24:56.068
You know what? You guys go home, okay?

24:56.128 --> 24:57.801
Frankie and I can take it from here.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.274
They could help unload.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.868
You don't look good. You eat lunch?

25:02.134 --> 25:05.445
I just haven't been sleeping
so good, that's all.

25:06.572 --> 25:07.846
I heard what the cops found.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.045
I know. But you're standing up good.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.385
Your loyalty, that's what's appreciated.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.055
Thanks, Jojo.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.753
"The power within stays safe
and free from assault,

25:16.815 --> 25:19.352
"superior to pleasure and pain,
doing nothing randomly."

25:19.418 --> 25:21.159
- You remember that?
- I do.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.426
I know you do.

25:22.488 --> 25:25.128
And I know you're gonna
continue standing by everyone.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.669
Your fellow warriors.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.365
Any sacrifice that's needed.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.571
That's what I know you can do.

25:32.498 --> 25:34.102
Well, what do you mean?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.537
If it's necessary,

25:39.438 --> 25:41.816
we know you'll do what a man would do.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.590
"Don't act as if you're
going to live 10,000 years.

25:48.647 --> 25:49.955
"Death hangs over you.

25:50.983 --> 25:55.762
"While you live, while it's
in your power, be good."

26:00.125 --> 26:02.162
Frankie's not home a lot of the time.

26:02.661 --> 26:05.574
Look, is there a reward
for information or what?

26:06.432 --> 26:07.570
- A reward?
- Hmm.

26:07.633 --> 26:11.171
Maybe we can scrounge something
up. What do you think?

26:11.236 --> 26:14.217
$20 bucks. We can handle $20 bucks.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.547
$20 bucks?

26:16.075 --> 26:19.022
Well, it's not like he's on
the FBI's top 10 list.

26:23.949 --> 26:28.091
Well, I can see Frankie's Mom
has kept her youthful looks.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.869
Don't run, Frankie. It won't
be good for you if you run.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.175
I'm not running.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.479
What you go and do, you little jerk?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.917
Bringing the cops into my house

26:49.975 --> 26:51.318
after all I've done for you.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.048
I hope they fry you.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.281
That's a good attitude, Frank.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.461
And so it begins.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.161
Your Dad's quite a ladies man, huh?

27:11.864 --> 27:13.901
When my Dad came home at night,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.938
I could smell them on him.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.151
I was ashamed.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.386
Right? I mean, like your Dad.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.129
I can see why you look up to Jojo.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.164
I really can.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.496
"Everything has always been the same."

27:38.624 --> 27:39.796
How do you mean?

27:40.492 --> 27:43.371
"You can't lose another life
than the one you're living now,

27:43.929 --> 27:46.307
"or live another one
than the one you're losing.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.976
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

27:50.636 --> 27:52.138
What's he talking about?

27:53.338 --> 27:56.046
"The longest life is
the same as the shortest."

27:56.441 --> 27:57.852
I know this.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.161
"Some things are rushing into
existence. Others out of it."

28:10.489 --> 28:12.127
Did you read this, Frankie?

28:12.191 --> 28:17.140
"Time is a river, a violent
current of events, glimpsed...

28:19.031 --> 28:20.135
"Glimpsed..."

28:20.199 --> 28:23.908
"Glimpsed once, already
carried past us and is gone."

28:25.837 --> 28:26.838
Yeah.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.477
That's Marcus Aurelius.

28:29.741 --> 28:31.277
The dictates of a warrior.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.255
Okay.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.166
Call EMS. He's taken something.
He's trying to kill himself.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.763
This is unit 229. We have
an attempted suicide.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.932
What did you take, Frankie?

28:50.996 --> 28:54.239
I am a warrior. I welcome death.

28:54.299 --> 28:58.247
Yes, and warriors try to live.
They fight and they... And they live.

28:58.503 --> 29:00.449
The son of a bitch!

29:00.505 --> 29:03.577
He told him to do it! He told him to!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.782
He's on a respirator. It's touch and go.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.021
He took some kind of cyanide. He must
have been carrying it around with him.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.392
In case of capture?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.659
What, did this boy step out
of, an old war movie?

29:15.721 --> 29:17.462
An old Roman war movie.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.399
Before he went into convulsions,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.529
he was quoting Marcus Aurelius.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.368
Marcus Aurelius? The Meditations.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.875
He was a Roman emperor... and a
follower of the Roman Stoic philosophy.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.707
But I wasn't aware that Marcus Aurelius

29:28.767 --> 29:30.769
was an advocate of suicide.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.042
Well, he wasn't.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.812
But like any belief system in the wrong hands,

29:34.873 --> 29:37.877
Stoicism can be twisted
to mean whatever you want.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.219
The wrong hands being Jojo Rios.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.316
His idea of self-control.

29:44.950 --> 29:49.421
The way that the bodies
were laid out for the burial,

29:49.488 --> 29:51.525
where they were buried,

29:52.658 --> 29:54.729
he's following the playbook.

29:55.394 --> 29:59.001
Even the name of his sound
studio, Sixteen-One.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.437
The year 161 AD,

30:02.134 --> 30:05.081
the year Marcus Aurelius was made emperor.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.545
Mr. Rios sees himself as a general?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.845
Leading 12-year-olds in
a criminal enterprise

30:11.910 --> 30:14.720
with the help of a second century philosophy?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.490
Stoicism inspired the Roman legions

30:17.549 --> 30:19.426
to march across Europe and Africa.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.327
I mean, if you're gonna start a gang,

30:21.386 --> 30:22.763
you could pick a worse model.

30:22.821 --> 30:26.496
Detectives, I'm sorry. The
Marino boy didn't make it.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.662
The doctor will be out to talk to you.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.230
I need to notify the next of kin. The father.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.338
Nurse,

30:37.069 --> 30:40.516
his father, he's not gonna care.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.217
We need a gag order.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.916
I mean, the hospital can put out

30:47.979 --> 30:49.754
that we brought Frank Marino in,

30:49.815 --> 30:52.955
but we don't want them to
tell anyone that he's dead.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.019
We don't?

30:54.319 --> 30:56.765
No. If Frank Marino talked,

30:56.822 --> 30:59.894
we'd have a case against Jojo Rios.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.537
We need him to have talked.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.235
Excuse me, but I really
do need to notify the parents.

31:06.298 --> 31:09.142
Nurse, I'm Ronald Carver,

31:09.201 --> 31:10.908
Assistant District Attorney.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.846
I need to explain something to you.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.684
It's time to round up some legionnaires.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.304
Bennie, come on.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.039
I'm moving. I'm moving.

31:43.101 --> 31:44.375
Not anymore.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.437
Uh-oh.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.515
Jojo takes care of us.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.145
No, see, that money he's
making off the bicycles,

31:52.210 --> 31:54.588
he's not putting that in your college fund.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.725
He's gonna spend it while you sit in Spofford.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.990
Ramon, don't be a sucker!

32:03.989 --> 32:06.697
Your mom's all alone with
your two little brothers.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.136
What are they gonna think if you go to jail?

32:09.194 --> 32:12.073
They'll see I'm a man. To stay true.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.338
That's what it means to be a man.

32:16.735 --> 32:20.410
Christopher White, Marcos Reyes,

32:20.906 --> 32:25.082
Jamal Dupuis and Sami Iberra.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.287
What happened to them, Bennie?

32:28.079 --> 32:30.320
And why did Jojo have them killed?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.352
Listen, I do not know anything about that.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.192
What about Christopher White?
He was in your class.

32:36.254 --> 32:39.258
He must have done something
pretty bad to end up like this.

32:39.324 --> 32:42.271
What, was he weak? Disloyal?

32:42.327 --> 32:44.238
Did he steal from the others?

32:44.296 --> 32:45.866
Listen, he was a good person.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.805
He was a good person?

32:53.238 --> 32:54.239
Yeah.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.113
That's right.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.311
I forgot.

33:04.950 --> 33:08.488
You don't speak ill of the dead.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.692
You don't speak ill of a fellow warrior.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.498
Chris White was a fellow warrior.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.699
He's buried in New Jersey,

33:19.130 --> 33:21.167
the land of his birth

33:27.672 --> 33:31.085
because that's what Marcus
Aurelius told you to do.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.461
You see, we know all
about Jojo and Mr. Aurelius.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.825
Frankie told us.

33:40.218 --> 33:43.358
Did you know that he was arrested earlier?

33:44.089 --> 33:46.899
If that had happened, he'd know what to do.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.435
He wouldn't just nark on Jojo.

33:48.493 --> 33:49.494
Oh, no.

33:51.029 --> 33:55.500
No, he told us how him and
Jojo laid Chris in his grave.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.775
No. Frankie's a hero, just like Jojo.

33:59.137 --> 34:00.673
He would never turn his back on us.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.845
Jojo's a hero? How do you figure
that? He's a sound engineer.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.752
No, no. I know his story.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.585
Jojo came from Cuba.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.523
His boat sank, and it was night.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.628
Everybody drowned except for Jojo.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.690
He made it because he's strong.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.525
He taught us how to be strong.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.069
- To be true?
- Yes.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.032
He showed you by example.

34:25.263 --> 34:26.764
You would never betray him

34:26.831 --> 34:28.833
because he would never betray you.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.176
- Yes.
- The way of the warrior.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.724
Well, it's nice to see kids
studying the classics.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.784
And learning all the wrong lessons.

34:45.850 --> 34:49.422
Well, should we pick up a few
more of Mr. Rios' disciples?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.094
Well, there's no point.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.534
I mean, we can't threaten them
with anything more potent

34:53.592 --> 34:55.230
than what they're already afraid of.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.631
Afraid of falling short, as warriors, as men,

34:59.197 --> 35:01.677
in the eyes of their hero.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.077
All that's missing is
war paint and a bonfire.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.843
The wild place inside every boy's heart.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.017
You know, Jojo knows that...

35:13.979 --> 35:16.755
Well, he knows that every
good hero needs a good story.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.127
I need to call the INS.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.226
I was going out to see
a client about a booking.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.328
- You're lucky you caught me.
- We're lucky that way.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.964
Well, we won't be long.
It's about Frank Marino.

35:31.029 --> 35:33.509
- What did you call him? Your apprentice?
- Yeah.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.602
Frankie's a good kid. I
hope he's not in trouble.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.702
Afraid so.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.476
We think he's mixed up with
a ring of bicycle thieves.

35:39.537 --> 35:40.811
That's hard to believe.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.852
Well, what's worse is that

35:45.710 --> 35:48.213
when we were questioning
him, he did something,

35:49.848 --> 35:51.418
well, inexplicable.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.058
He took cyanide.

35:54.919 --> 35:56.057
My God, that's...

35:56.488 --> 35:57.489
He killed himself?

35:58.356 --> 35:59.630
Well, no.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.359
He botched it.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.168
He's still alive.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.866
He's at Methodist Hospital.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.375
We should be able to talk to him by tomorrow.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.005
That's good. I'm glad he's gonna make it.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.579
He might not be so glad.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.380
He's facing a couple murder charges

36:16.441 --> 36:18.921
for Sami Iberra and his father, Enrique.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.354
Yeah, he botched that, too.

36:21.379 --> 36:24.292
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he wasn't
planning on Sami's father,

36:24.349 --> 36:27.796
you know, running out of the
park with his throat slit.

36:28.219 --> 36:31.098
Look, I'd be surprised if Frankie
had anything to do with that.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.664
But then again, I don't really
know what he does on his own time.

36:35.727 --> 36:39.174
Well, what he does is, I mean,
you know, besides heisting bikes

36:41.099 --> 36:42.271
and killing people...

36:42.333 --> 36:44.040
On his own time.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.546
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.082
That's expensive equipment.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.947
Sure, sure. So sorry.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.949
What he does is he fills his mind

36:53.645 --> 36:57.354
with some kind of, you
know, martial philosophy

36:58.416 --> 37:02.330
about warriors and loyalty, accepting death.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.898
That's what he talked about
on the way to the hospital.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.935
You don't know anything about that?

37:09.461 --> 37:10.496
No.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.736
That's funny because we thought
that it came from you,

37:13.798 --> 37:16.335
you know, along with the protein bars.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.272
I mean, even if I did believe all that stuff,

37:20.572 --> 37:24.076
these are hard-core street kids, you know?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.553
I mean, they wouldn't listen to a guy like me.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.989
Come on, you're being too modest.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.253
These kids look up to you.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.453
Where did you hear that from?

37:31.516 --> 37:34.554
Bennie Renato. He thinks you're a hero.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.461
That's crazy. You know, these are street kids.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.060
They're running a con on you.

37:41.559 --> 37:45.939
Well, no, I mean, Bennie,
he seemed very sincere.

37:47.532 --> 37:51.446
Hey, he told us about your
perilous crossing from Cuba.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.382
You know, your boat sank at
night. Everyone drowned.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.086
I mean, except you.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.557
That's right. I told him that. So what?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.286
Why, because it's true, right?

38:03.414 --> 38:04.620
Of course.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.423
It was the Mariel boat lift.

38:07.418 --> 38:09.227
It was when Castro emptied his jails.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.891
You came over with your father.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.294
Your father is a convicted rapist.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.634
That's a lie.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.641
Hey, not according to your INS file.

38:21.766 --> 38:24.406
Your boat, well, it didn't sink.

38:26.404 --> 38:31.114
And those people, nobody was lost at sea or...

38:33.678 --> 38:37.182
The INS put your father
in a detention center.

38:37.282 --> 38:38.818
They put you in a foster home

38:38.883 --> 38:41.989
and then in a group home until you were 17.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.793
Okay. Okay.

38:46.591 --> 38:47.899
Sol made up a story.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.905
Well, not just any story.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.769
Well, it was, you know, a hero's story.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.471
I mean, you know, the child
being plucked from the water.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.104
That's Moses with a little
Jonah thrown in there.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.848
And then the orphan who grows
up to be a great leader.

39:00.905 --> 39:05.081
That's Marcus Aurelius.

39:06.578 --> 39:07.886
You know what?

39:11.883 --> 39:13.590
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:13.651 --> 39:17.929
No? Marcus Aurelius. That warrior's creed?

39:18.756 --> 39:21.168
That loyalty unto death stuff?

39:23.962 --> 39:25.066
You taught them that.

39:25.129 --> 39:26.130
No.

39:27.498 --> 39:29.136
Look, I was new in the neighborhood.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.736
I had to make nice with the locals,

39:30.802 --> 39:32.509
so I let their kids hang out here. That's all.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.244
Oh, that's good for PR, I guess.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.307
I swear to God.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.753
And if I told them stories, Boy
Scout crap, it was just talk.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.757
All that stuff about loyalty was just talk?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.520
Loyalty's fine as far as it goes,

39:43.581 --> 39:46.721
but if Frankie and Bennie did something
illegal, that's not my responsibility.

39:46.784 --> 39:49.697
And if they're telling you something
different, they're liars.

39:51.289 --> 39:55.362
So, you gave them some attention

39:55.426 --> 39:58.202
and a little advice and
sent them on their way.

39:58.263 --> 39:59.435
That's all I did.

39:59.497 --> 40:04.207
And if they got into trouble, you know,
themselves, they were on their own.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.748
I don't owe them a thing.

40:08.506 --> 40:09.678
Not even loyalty?

40:11.509 --> 40:12.510
Nothing.

40:14.946 --> 40:18.120
All right, Mr. Rios, I think
we've wasted enough of your time

40:18.182 --> 40:19.627
talking about these punks.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.694
What are you doing?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.203
Did you take that CD out of there?

40:28.259 --> 40:30.569
- Hey man, the thing just popped out.
- Yeah, the hell it did.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.172
You recorded me.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.604
You son of a bitch recorded me.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.705
What's the big deal? It's not like...

40:39.771 --> 40:41.011
Now, you can't take that!

40:42.607 --> 40:44.985
That's my property, now you give it to me.

40:51.549 --> 40:54.086
What did you think you were
gonna do with this, huh?

40:54.385 --> 40:55.887
I was gonna use it

40:55.954 --> 40:59.458
to see if any of the kids had illusions
about how you felt about them.

41:00.024 --> 41:02.004
I told you, those dumb kids

41:02.060 --> 41:04.165
have got nothing to do with me.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.674
I'm surprised at you, Jojo.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.175
About what?

41:17.408 --> 41:22.016
Well, I mean, a guy like you on the cutting
edge of sound recording technology,

41:23.214 --> 41:26.684
you know, thinking that we would
resort to using a synthesizer

41:27.018 --> 41:28.361
to bug your sound studio.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.956
Especially when we have neat stuff like this.

41:31.022 --> 41:34.526
An omni-directional microphone
and transmitter all in one.

41:34.592 --> 41:37.869
You know, that broadcasts
theater-quality sound

41:37.929 --> 41:41.206
through brick and soundproofing

41:42.367 --> 41:45.712
up to 100 yards away.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.486
You know, I can't believe you, Jojo.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.587
You know, I'm so stupid.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.092
What you think you heard,

41:58.483 --> 41:59.689
it was a trick.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.560
Listen, I heard, all right?

42:01.886 --> 42:03.058
So tell me, Jojo,

42:04.255 --> 42:05.598
what do we do now?

42:06.457 --> 42:09.370
To be true. What, do we be like Frankie?

42:10.895 --> 42:13.705
Tell me, what do we do to stay true?

42:18.403 --> 42:20.713
Yeah. I just want to tell them everything.

42:20.772 --> 42:21.773
Don't you dare!

42:21.839 --> 42:24.115
Jojo Rios, you're under arrest for murder.

42:24.175 --> 42:26.587
No, no, no. Bennie, Bennie,
Bennie! Listen to me.

42:26.644 --> 42:28.885
Listen to me! Listen.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.453
Listen, you're not stupid, Bennie.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.386
You're not stupid.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.925
You're a strong kid. You're a true kid.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.434
That book that you read about being a warrior,

42:41.225 --> 42:42.329
that was good.

42:43.494 --> 42:47.874
It's Jojo, man, he sent you
on a battle that wasn't good.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.845
But you, you're true.

42:54.038 --> 42:55.483
And you're strong.

42:56.841 --> 42:58.081
You hear me?

43:09.287 --> 43:12.200
I hope they find a better
role model for their kids.

43:12.557 --> 43:15.163
They could do worse than Sami's father.
