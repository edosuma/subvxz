00:01.100 --> 00:02.362
Previously on Elementary...
Excuse me.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.665
What's your problem?
My problem is I don't
like being followed.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.032
Your problem is that I know
what you look like now.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.664
Don't move,
the police are on their way.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.502
(grunts)

00:15.540 --> 00:17.098
You work for Sherlock.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.139
I don't work
for anyone.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.408
I'm his new partner.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.816
I'm a mentor, Watson.
I-I'm a teacher.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.818
I realized it wasn't you
I was afraid of losing,

00:23.850 --> 00:24.646
it was our
relationship.

00:24.690 --> 00:26.555
Then I realized
I could do it again.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.649
So you dug up that girl?
Kitty.

00:28.690 --> 00:29.827
I told Captain Gregson
I was okay

00:29.860 --> 00:33.250
with you coming back
to the precinct.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.790
I'm even okay with, uh, Kitty.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.195
I'm very glad to hear that.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.561
We're still
not partners.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.261
We'll work on our own cases,
of course.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.188
But if you ever need
a consultation

00:41.240 --> 00:42.832
or fresh eyes on something,
whatever...

00:42.870 --> 00:44.064
I-I'm available.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.532
As I am to you.

00:51.610 --> 00:52.747
That's her, huh?

00:52.780 --> 00:54.077
The new partner?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.769
Miss Winter is
my protge,

00:55.820 --> 00:57.082
not my partner.

00:57.120 --> 00:57.814
The captain
insisted on

00:57.850 --> 00:59.112
a thorough
vetting process,

00:59.160 --> 01:00.457
including this
face-to-face,

01:00.490 --> 01:03.459
before he grants his
approval that she assists me.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.118
You're staring.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.752
I'm just letting it
sink in.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.324
You're really back.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.167
You are as keen an observer
as ever, Detective.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.599
Soon you will deduce
it is daytime,

01:13.640 --> 01:15.164
and we are standing
in a police station.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.206
So, where'd you find her? MI6?

01:19.240 --> 01:20.639
She's, in fact, a civilian.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.671
She was referred to me
by a colleague at Scotland Yard.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.143
A boy had gone missing,

01:24.180 --> 01:26.216
and she had some unique insights
into the matter.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.444
She helped identify
his abductor,

01:27.480 --> 01:29.812
and then insisted on
taking none of the credit.

01:29.850 --> 01:32.614
I could not help but be reminded
of my younger self.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.855
Of course, you couldn't.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.225
The homicide that's
been plaguing you,

01:38.260 --> 01:39.659
the file on
your desk.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.497
The file that was in my drawer?

01:41.530 --> 01:43.327
The accumulated
coffee rings suggested

01:43.370 --> 01:45.224
you were at an impasse.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.397
The neighbor in apartment 3-3
is your killer.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.203
The marks on
the victim

01:49.240 --> 01:50.559
you were assuming were
fingernail scratches,

01:50.610 --> 01:53.238
I submit they were made
by bird talons.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.578
Specifically, those of
a blue-throated macaw.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.475
The precinct had received
a number of complaints

01:57.510 --> 01:59.375
about the noise of the parrot
in apartment 3-B,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.240
all prior to the day
of the murder,

02:01.280 --> 02:03.612
at which point
the complaints abruptly ceased.

02:03.650 --> 02:06.710
So, my vic gets fed up
with the noise, kills the bird,

02:06.760 --> 02:09.456
gets a few scratches
for his troubles,

02:09.490 --> 02:12.493
then 3-B finds out
and kills him.

02:13.530 --> 02:15.293
You're staring again.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.298
I'm just letting it
sink in again.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.366
You're really back.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.431
(waves crashing)

02:39.360 --> 02:41.351
*

03:05.580 --> 03:08.276
(phone line ringing)

03:08.320 --> 03:09.412
MAN:
Hello?

03:09.450 --> 03:11.543
Theo, I know you said
not to call.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.217
Somebody's found me,
somebody knows.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.454
Who is this?

03:14.490 --> 03:15.718
Who is this?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.227
Where's Theo?

03:17.260 --> 03:20.457
This is Thomas Gregson
of the NYPD.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.320
Mr. Fordham is unavailable.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.598
Now, who am I
speaking to?

03:23.630 --> 03:25.268
What happened?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.234
(door opens)
Wh-What's going on?

03:27.270 --> 03:29.431
(door closes)
Oh, my God.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.358
There's someone here.
Sir?

03:31.410 --> 03:32.604
No, please.
Try to stay calm.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.278
Tell us where you are

03:34.310 --> 03:35.777
No, no, no, no.
so that we can send help.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.970
No! Look,
I'll give you anything.

03:37.010 --> 03:37.977
Anything you want!

03:38.010 --> 03:40.615
(two gunshots, body thuds)

03:40.650 --> 03:41.969
Sir?

03:42.020 --> 03:43.988
(line clicks)
Sir? Sir?

03:44.020 --> 03:47.387
Hello? Hello?!

03:47.420 --> 03:48.785
Hello?

04:28.530 --> 04:30.623
(elevator bell dings)

04:35.940 --> 04:37.305
Watson.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.501
Hi.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.428
The captain already asked me
to take this one.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.041
Yes. Of course he did.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.776
Might I ask you to consider
an extenuating circumstance?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.015
Two men receive envelopes
from an anonymous sender.

04:50.050 --> 04:54.089
Each envelope empty, except
for five orange plastic beads.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.920
Then, within hours of one
another, both men are murdered.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.518
It's unlikely
I'll find another case

04:59.560 --> 05:01.027
even half as worthy
of my attention.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.698
I could say the same thing.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.561
And indeed you should.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.329
Well, I guess
it was bound to happen.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.759
Sometimes we're gonna be
interested in the same cases.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.961
Sometimes.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.619
Two bodies, two detectives?

05:21.620 --> 05:22.518
What about your new friend?

05:22.550 --> 05:24.381
Where's she?

05:24.420 --> 05:27.355
I dispatched Kitty to the
site of the first murder.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.585
The Crime Scene Unit
had a backlog last night,

05:29.630 --> 05:31.029
and they're only
processing it just now.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.790
So, she'll take photographs,
observe Detective Bell.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.560
It's a somewhat menial task,
but she has much to learn.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.795
(sniffing)

05:38.830 --> 05:41.492
The first victim was a lavwer
named Theodore Fordham.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.805
Victim number two,
the man who was on the phone

05:44.840 --> 05:47.001
with Gregson
before he was shot...

05:47.040 --> 05:48.507
Elias Openshaw.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.974
And you knew that how?

05:51.010 --> 05:54.776
The Pipz, aka "the beads."

05:56.590 --> 05:58.717
They're from a toy which was
implicated in the deaths

05:58.750 --> 06:00.456
of a number
of children last year.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.584
Mr. Openshaw ran the company
which manufactured them.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.882
Mr. Fordham was his criminal
defense attorney.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.490
Some of the Pipz,
you see, were poison.

06:08.530 --> 06:11.920
Ordinarily, they were made
from non-toxic plastic.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.631
But the factory in India
which produced them

06:13.670 --> 06:16.605
exchanged one chemical for
another in order to save money,

06:16.640 --> 06:18.062
and the resulting beads
metabolized

06:18.110 --> 06:20.101
into a drug when swallowed.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.778
The drug was GHB.

06:21.810 --> 06:25.849
I saw enough GHB overdoses
during my ER rotation.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.643
Club kids, date
rape victims...

06:27.680 --> 06:29.841
So, how many children
swallowed the beads?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.517
Nine that were
hospitalized.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.814
Four of them
did not survive.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.920
Explains why someone
wanted this guy dead.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.599
So, these bruises
on his abdomen...

06:39.630 --> 06:41.154
could be he was
hit by a car,

06:41.200 --> 06:42.929
maybe a few weeks
before he died.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.824
Another, less successful attempt
on his life, perhaps?

06:44.870 --> 06:46.895
(cell phone chimes)

06:49.570 --> 06:52.038
It's the captain, he wants
to see me about the case.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.104
I'll tell him
you'll be joining.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.811
Until his past caught up
with him last night,

06:59.850 --> 07:03.115
Elias Openshaw had been
living as a fugitive.

07:03.150 --> 07:06.711
Agent Boden here was point
on the Feds' search,

07:06.760 --> 07:09.115
so I asked him to come in
and bring us up to speed.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.550
The FBI charged
Openshaw with murder.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.659
So, you believe he knew
the toys were poison

07:14.700 --> 07:15.792
but sold them anyway.

07:15.830 --> 07:18.560
We didn't believe, we had proof.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.137
He issued a recall
after It was too late,

07:21.170 --> 07:23.707
but we arrested him
and seized the inventory.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.629
Then, while he was awaiting
trial, he skipped bail.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.079
He'd been in hiding ever since.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.702
But we always figured
his lawyer, Fordham,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.741
was helping him stay at large.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.645
Any suspects leap out based
on your knowledge of the case?

07:33.680 --> 07:34.749
Starting, most obviously,

07:34.780 --> 07:35.974
with the parents
of children who died?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.749
Well, there's a list in there.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.611
But aside from them--
no, not yet.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.887
(shutter clicking)

07:45.930 --> 07:47.591
All right.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.927
Thanks.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.632
Hey, I heard you had a knack
for missing persons.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.135
You know,
I've never been to London.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.670
Hear it's a lot like New York.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.909
I guess you guys don't
get the same number

08:10.950 --> 08:12.713
of gun deaths over there
as we do, huh?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.819
Not many countries do.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.164
I just wanted to make sure
you saw where you were going.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.690
I wouldn't have stepped there.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.162
I know what I'm doing.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.566
I'll keep that in mind.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.601
(cell phone dings)

08:37.580 --> 08:39.002
Sherlock, he sent
through a list

08:39.050 --> 08:40.278
of the parents
whose children died.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.755
The postal code the orange beads
were mailed from,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.893
it matches the address of one
of the parents-- Gabe Coleman.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.921
I'll let the captain know.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.806
I don't know what more
I can tell you

09:05.840 --> 09:07.979
than what I already told
the other cops.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.568
Other cops?

09:09.610 --> 09:11.100
What other cops,
Mr. Coleman?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.141
Somebody broke into
the building last night.

09:13.180 --> 09:17.287
It was probably just some kids,
nobody was missing anything.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.788
Some other cops came by-- I told
them that I wasn't around.

09:19.820 --> 09:23.119
Do you mind telling us
where you were last night?

09:23.160 --> 09:25.822
Do you mind telling me
what this is about?

09:25.860 --> 09:28.294
I assume you know the
name Elias Openshaw.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.161
Of course I do.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.260
Well, he was murdered
a little after 9:30 last night.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.801
His lawyer
is dead, too.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.374
Someone finally found him.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.299
Openshaw.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.739
Do you mind telling
us where you were

09:48.780 --> 09:51.988
between the hours
of 9:00 pm. and 10:00 p.m.?

09:52.020 --> 09:54.284
Uh... working.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.852
I, uh... in my car, mostly.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.996
I service vending machines
around the city, night shift.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.964
Was anyone with you?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.239
No, I was alone.

10:07.270 --> 10:11.366
Elias Openshaw took more than
your son from you, did he not?

10:12.940 --> 10:14.999
In the aftermath
of that terrible tragedy,

10:15.040 --> 10:16.905
you lost your career,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.645
marriage.

10:18.680 --> 10:22.013
I remember reading
about a Mrs. Coleman.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.245
And it's apparent here
that you live alone.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.350
You can appreciate why we would
want to speak with you

10:27.390 --> 10:28.857
in the light
of Mr. Openshaw's murder.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.380
Lots of people hated him.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.852
WATSON:
It's true.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.949
But whoever killed him
sent him a package.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.422
An envelope from this zip code.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.099
And that makes me the killer?

10:38.130 --> 10:40.792
It make you a person
of interest.
I didn't do it.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.934
Well, then you wouldn't mind if
our guys look around the place?

10:43.970 --> 10:45.403
(scoffs)

10:45.440 --> 10:47.738
(sighs)

10:47.780 --> 10:49.407
You people-- you're amazing.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.244
You lose the guy
who murdered my son,

10:53.280 --> 10:55.441
you put me through hell.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.380
My wife...

10:57.420 --> 11:00.878
And now, someone does your job
for you, and you just come here?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.410
You harass me?

11:02.460 --> 11:04.928
Mr. Coleman, you're not making
this easy.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.825
Why should I?

11:06.860 --> 11:08.953
Why should I make it easy
for you?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.218
You want to accuse me
of something

11:11.270 --> 11:12.737
I didn't do?

11:12.770 --> 11:14.237
You want
to tear my apartment up,

11:14.270 --> 11:16.704
you do it the hard way,
you get a warrant.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.770
(loud music playing)

11:31.090 --> 11:33.058
(turns music off)

11:33.090 --> 11:35.251
What if I'd been
an intruder?

11:35.290 --> 11:38.088
I suppose you'd have gotten away
with my paint.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.893
Yeah, paint.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.763
Have you forgotten everything I
told you about my sensitivities?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.223
_ I'm not allowed to move
In, make the place my own?

11:45.270 --> 11:47.329
Mm. Watson never
felt the need.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.065
Yeah, well, I'm not Watson.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.774
How'd it go
with my suspect? Coleman?

11:53.810 --> 11:55.334
He failed
to provide a compelling alibi,

11:55.380 --> 11:58.008
and then refused to_ allow
the police to search his home.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.506
I'm inclined
to think he's innocent.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.212
For starters,
he seemed genuinely surprised

12:02.250 --> 12:03.911
at the news of Openshaw's death.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.510
Yeah, 'cause no one's ever
faked being surprised.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.983
Yes, well, you weren't there.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.057
No, I wasn't.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.859
I was supposed to wait for you?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.527
Allow our suspect
more time to flee?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.096
Perhaps take another life?

12:17.130 --> 12:19.792
I suppose it didn't matter,
then, did it?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.467
The detail I spotted
was useless.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.106
In point of fact,
your observation was
the opposite of useless.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.869
It is because _
the envelopes were mailed

12:26.910 --> 12:29.037
from Coleman's post code that
I believe he's not the killer.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.479
His work takes him
all over the city.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.444
Given the slightest instinct
for self-preservation,

12:32.480 --> 12:35.040
could he not have just mailed
those beads from somewhere else?

12:35.080 --> 12:38.880
Do you think
someone's setting him up?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.911
I think
it's a distinct possibility.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.224
I've said as much to Watson
and the captain.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.478
Mr. Coleman's innocence,
on the other hand,

12:45.530 --> 12:47.748
is a virtual certainty.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.524
(sighs)

12:51.570 --> 12:54.767
(elevator bell dings)

12:56.100 --> 12:58.330
Mr. Coleman? Hi.

12:58.370 --> 13:02.033
Um, I'm Joan. I met you earlier?

13:02.080 --> 13:05.004
Yeah, you work with the captain.
I'm on my way to see him now.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.278
Oh, I can take him. Thanks.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.789
Do you mind me asking
what this is about?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.855
I did it.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.225
I killed Openshaw
and his lawyer.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.296
Everything's in my car.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.992
The beads that I used,
and the envelopes and the gun.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.889
And I came here
because I want to confess.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.087
So, ballistics has completed
their analysis

13:50.130 --> 13:52.997
of the gun
that you surrendered.

13:53.030 --> 13:55.123
Would you like to know
what they found?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.225
They confirmed

13:58.270 --> 14:02.036
it was the weapon used
to murder Openshaw and Fordham.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.332
You sound surprised.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.167
You look surprised.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.474
Or rather, as though you didn't
know what I was going to say.

14:08.980 --> 14:12.245
Earlier, you mentioned there had
been a break-in at your building

14:12.280 --> 14:15.215
while you were away, but that
no one reported anything stolen.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.188
See, I believe that's because

14:19.220 --> 14:21.484
the intruder
planted things instead.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.284
After we left,
you found a gun

14:24.330 --> 14:26.025
and other evidence
hidden in your home.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.597
And faced with the discovery
that you were being framed,

14:28.630 --> 14:30.359
you decided to go along with it.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.891
No.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.932
I did it. I killed Openshaw
and his lawyer.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.438
Did you?
So, who did you kill first?

14:38.470 --> 14:41.200
I don't have to talk to you.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.379
No, you don't.

14:44.710 --> 14:48.510
But I can assure you...

14:48.550 --> 14:51.212
I am the most likely
individual in the world

14:51.250 --> 14:54.981
to prove that you are not
the real killer.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.682
So if you want everyone
to keep believing that you are,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.288
perhaps you should
make some effort

14:59.330 --> 15:01.548
to persuade me
why I should allow it.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.960
I don't have to tell you
anything except I did it.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.966
I killed Openshaw.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.205
I wanted _to
for a long time.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.379
I loved two people
in this world,

15:16.410 --> 15:18.640
and I lost both of
them because of him.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.319
Your son._..
and your Wife.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.140
The wife who left you.

15:28.590 --> 15:32.082
Things were never the
same after Dylan died.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.291
Amy was angry...

15:34.330 --> 15:36.457
At you.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.735
That's what this is about,
is it not?

15:41.770 --> 15:43.738
She wanted you
to do something.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.159
I wanted to.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.735
I was angry, too.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.645
But I couldn't
do anything.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.648
I couldn't even get out
of bed to go to work.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.259
So let's say I
am being framed.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.157
If that were true...

16:03.190 --> 16:05.727
I'd take that fall.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.149
I know it wouldn't
get Amy back,

16:08.200 --> 16:09.997
but at least
she would know

16:10.030 --> 16:12.419
that I'm the one
who got the guy.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.578
But like I said,
no one's framing anyone.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.713
Hey.

16:31.750 --> 16:35.083
Hey. When am I going
to meet this Andrew guy?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.054
Ithought
we were supposed to get drinks.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.081
We will. He's
just still in that

16:39.130 --> 16:41.121
"hogging what little time
he gets with me" phase.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.297
Sounds nice.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.093
So, Hawes finished

16:44.130 --> 16:45.529
examining the bruises
on Openshaw's body.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.368
He thinks they might be
from a van or a small SUV,

16:48.400 --> 16:50.231
maybe around three
or four weeks ago.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.602
You think you could help me
dig into some traffic reports

16:52.640 --> 16:54.039
around that time?

16:54.080 --> 16:55.479
I'll make some calls.
Okay, thanks.

16:55.510 --> 16:58.104
(cell phone chimes)

16:58.150 --> 17:00.141
Sherlock. "Spoke again with

17:00.180 --> 17:03.081
"FBI Agent Boden. All other
affected families ruled out

17:03.120 --> 17:05.145
"as suspects.
Kitty and I

17:05.190 --> 17:08.216
"en route to prosecutor of Pipz
case in hopes of new insight.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.682
Please join."

17:09.720 --> 17:11.221
What do you think of her?

17:11.260 --> 17:14.798
The new... you. Kitty?

17:14.830 --> 17:18.163
Oh, let's just say, we didn't
get off to the greatest start.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.236
Hmm.
I guess I'm still
getting to know her.

17:20.270 --> 17:23.660
Yeah, but she seems pretty...
intense, right?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.304
Oh, that's a word for it.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.171
I don't mean to go
second-guessing the captain--

17:28.210 --> 17:31.202
I know he signed off-- but when
you were working with Holmes,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.115
it was like
you helped keep him stable.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.640
I look at this new girl.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.080
Stable's not the first word
that comes to mind.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.587
Amway,

17:38.620 --> 17:40.087
I'll let you know
if something turns up?

17:40.120 --> 17:43.055
Thanks.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.257
That was something.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.768
Back at the station-- what
you guessed about that man.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.165
I never guess.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.565
It's a shocking habit,

17:54.600 --> 17:56.568
destructive
to the logical faculty.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.204
We observe,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.208
and then we deduce.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.231
You invited Watson.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.475
I did.

18:04.510 --> 18:07.274
Did you think I couldn't
handle a simple meeting?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.641
Did you forget
that we're co-consulting?

18:09.680 --> 18:12.183
Watson.
Hey.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.484
Kitty.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.182
Mr. Holmes? Angela White,
Assistant US. Attorney.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.118
These are my colleagues,
Miss Watson and Miss Winter.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.856
Hi.
Thank you very much for taking
the time to speak with us.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.324
I've seen you on
TV, haven't I?
Occupational hazard.

18:25.370 --> 18:29.192
Come on back, let me see
ifI can be of help.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.629
I heard about Gabe Coleman's
arrest for the murders.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.877
The whole thing
is just tragic.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.606
HOLMES: Obviously, your

18:36.640 --> 18:39.370
preparations would've brought
you in contact with Mr. Coleman.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.277
Yeah, and I spoke with him
and his wife many times,

18:42.320 --> 18:44.788
along with the other families
who lost their children.

18:44.820 --> 18:47.254
Guys, you can finish that later.
Thanks.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.220
"Osamashaw."

18:50.260 --> 18:51.488
Oh. Bad joke.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.849
One of my staffers.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.323
Some journalist wrote

18:54.360 --> 18:56.396
that Openshaw was
this office's bin Laden.

18:56.430 --> 18:58.796
We knew he was out there,
we just couldn't find him.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.331
You know,
the frustrating thing was

19:00.370 --> 19:01.667
that we had him dead to rights.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.804
We had a paper trail proving
that this guy knew

19:03.840 --> 19:05.762
the toys were poison,
and he rolled the dice

19:05.810 --> 19:07.209
with the kids' lives anyway.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.401
You know, if Mr. Coleman
had just come to us,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.408
if he told us
that he'd located Mr. Openshaw,

19:11.450 --> 19:13.247
none of this had to happen.
HOLMES:
Well, actually, Miss White,

19:13.280 --> 19:14.918
we've come here because
we believe that recent events

19:14.950 --> 19:16.577
may be more tragic
than you imagine.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.440
We think Gabe Coleman
is innocent.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.412
We?
We were hoping
you might be able

19:20.460 --> 19:22.212
to steer_ us in
another direction.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.820
I'm sorry.
I heard he'd confessed.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.226
He did. We think
he's covering up for someone.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.399
Have you looked
into the other parents?

19:29.430 --> 19:33.264
Alibis all around.
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't see how I can help.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.394
You were surveilling the other
victim, Openshaw's lawyer?

19:36.440 --> 19:37.805
The FBI was,
at my instruction, yes.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.569
We didn't violate privilege,

19:39.610 --> 19:42.408
but as long as he was in public,
we were allowed to tail him.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.249
We were hoping
he'd lead us to Openshaw.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.441
It seems likely from
Mr. Fordham's death

19:46.480 --> 19:48.744
that somebody else had
a very similar idea.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.441
Perhaps reviewing
the surveillance footage

19:50.490 --> 19:52.640
that you have would help us
identify that individual,

19:52.690 --> 19:54.419
so, we would be
quite happy to...

19:54.460 --> 19:57.258
No. No, I'm sorry.
That won't be possible.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.826
When we were
watching Fordham,

19:58.860 --> 20:00.851
he was regularly interacting
with his other clients.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.289
I have a duty to protect
their confidentiality.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.298
Hmm.
But we can look
at the footage internally.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.298
If anything jumps out...

20:07.340 --> 20:08.693
Your people can't do
the job that we can.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.006
I'm sorry?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.439
Me and Mr. Holmes.

20:12.470 --> 20:13.869
We can find things
that they won't.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.299
Maybe you're like
Mr. Coleman.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.841
Maybe you don't want us
to find the killer.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.348
Maybe that's something the media
would be curious to hear.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.972
I think what my colleague
is trying to say...

20:22.020 --> 20:25.319
It was a pleasure meeting you.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.511
I will be in touch.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.021
KITTY:
I screwed up, okay?

20:31.060 --> 20:32.527
I know I screwed up.
You don't have to say it.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.391
Oh, no, I want to.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.467
You just accused an assistant
US. attorney of obstruction.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.468
You've dashed any chance
we might have had

20:39.500 --> 20:41.365
of reviewing their surveillance
of Openshaw's lawyer.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.334
I was trying something.

20:43.370 --> 20:46.305
Yes. Something stupid.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.638
How many times do
I have to tell you?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.875
You are not in
competition With Watson.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.502
Ever since you started
back up with her,

20:52.550 --> 20:53.972
it's like I've been demoted.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.739
You used me in London,
you gave me real work to do.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.010
Now I'm photographing
bloody crime scenes,

20:59.050 --> 21:00.711
watching her conduct interviews.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.352
Did it ever occur to you

21:02.390 --> 21:05.359
I might have invited her
to join us for your benefit?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.927
That putting you in a
room as she and I work

21:07.960 --> 21:09.450
might be a chance
for you to observe?

21:10.870 --> 21:13.338
Why are we even bothering
with this one?

21:13.370 --> 21:14.462
This one what?
This case.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.991
Two pieces of excrement
are dead.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.338
The father wants to take credit.

21:19.370 --> 21:22.430
It's helping him, so why can't
we just give him his peace?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.970
You can't honestly believe
that life in prison

21:24.010 --> 21:26.501
is going to feel like peace
for very long.

21:26.550 --> 21:29.474
And your opinion of Messrs.
Openshaw and Fordham aside,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.681
we know very little
about the actual motives

21:31.720 --> 21:34.655
of an actual killer
who is still at large.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.578
I would've thought that you,
more than most,

21:36.620 --> 21:38.520
would be unwilling to allow
a murderer to roam free

21:38.560 --> 21:41.529
simply because the world accepts
an inaccurate account of things.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.935
(elevator bell dings)

21:49.970 --> 21:52.029
BELL: Hey.
Hey.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.776
I was just about
to call you.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.334
I got a hit on
those traffic reports

21:55.380 --> 21:56.802
you asked me to look into.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.478
The driver
of a paratran5it van

21:58.510 --> 22:00.944
was involved in an incident
a few weeks ago.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.447
He's on his way in
for an interview.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.913
Ithought
you'd want to join.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.748
Should I let Holmes know, too?

22:06.790 --> 22:08.587
Um...

22:08.620 --> 22:10.986
Sure, the more the merrier,
right?

22:12.990 --> 22:15.390
I don't know what you
want me to say.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.398
I don't want any trouble.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.421
Mr. Azeem,
I promise you.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.392
You're not in any trouble,

22:21.440 --> 22:22.566
and no one wants
to cause you any.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.807
We just want to hear
what happened.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.401
Is this the man you hit
with your van or not?

22:28.440 --> 22:30.374
I'm turning onto Lexington.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.946
The light turns green.

22:31.980 --> 22:34.369
I go, and he runs
in front of my van.

22:34.420 --> 22:37.514
I stop... but I hit him.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.815
I get out, I try to help,
but he runs away.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.612
That's it?

22:42.660 --> 22:44.480
Nothing else?

22:44.530 --> 22:47.658
Please. Tell me what you want me
to say and I will say it.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.497
HOLMES:
Mr. Azeem.

22:49.530 --> 22:51.464
If it's any help,

22:51.500 --> 22:53.491
neither one _of us are
Citizens of this country.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.791
You have our assurance,
there will be no retribution

22:54.840 --> 22:56.398
against you for anything
that you say.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.101
Our only interest is the truth.

23:02.180 --> 23:06.640
When the man stand up,
they stare at each other.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.739
Like he sees the devil.

23:08.780 --> 23:11.715
And then they both hurry off.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.456
They both? So, Openshaw
was staring at someone?

23:13.490 --> 23:15.481
Did you see who it was?

23:17.790 --> 23:19.428
What?

23:19.460 --> 23:20.688
You're playing games with me.

23:20.730 --> 23:21.822
I don't want
any trouble.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.498
HOLMES:
Mr. Azeem,

23:23.530 --> 23:24.758
what has happened,
since coming into this room,

23:24.800 --> 23:25.824
that gives you the impression

23:25.870 --> 23:27.064
we're trying to entrap you?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.533
She is important lady.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.902
Her picture is right there.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.066
Wait a second.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.509
You're saying you saw
these two people,

23:33.540 --> 23:35.428
together, three weeks ago?

23:35.480 --> 23:36.538
Mm-hmm.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.970
Why don't you excuse us
for a second, all right?

23:50.120 --> 23:52.486
BELL:
Three weeks ago?

23:52.530 --> 23:53.895
That's when Openshaw
was on the lam.

23:53.930 --> 23:55.227
What was it Miss White
called him?

23:55.260 --> 23:56.898
Her personal bin Laden?

23:56.930 --> 23:59.228
It sounds like they crossed
paths by accident.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.589
Sure. But who bumps into their
bin Laden on the street

24:00.640 --> 24:01.789
and doesn't tell anyone?

24:08.210 --> 24:10.644
ANGELA: It never happened.
You did not cross paths

24:10.680 --> 24:11.977
with Mr. Openshaw
three weeks ago?

24:12.010 --> 24:13.944
Of course not.
Well, like I said,

24:13.980 --> 24:15.675
we got a witness
who says otherwise.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.585
You said it yourself yesterday,

24:17.620 --> 24:19.144
I'm on the news a lot.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.851
This van driver of yours
must've recognized me

24:20.890 --> 24:21.857
and gotten confused.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.755
It happens with witness
testimony all the time.

24:23.790 --> 24:24.984
WATSON:
It's true.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.122
You are on the news a lot.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.219
I went back and reviewed
some of the footage I'd seen.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.989
They say you're a rising
political star,

24:30.030 --> 24:31.918
that the New York US.
Attorney's office

24:31.970 --> 24:33.665
is traditionally
a stepping stone,

24:33.700 --> 24:36.066
and you're a shoo-in to run
for congress next cycle.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.204
HOLMES: Must have been a boon
to your political aspirations

24:38.240 --> 24:39.867
to no longer have
Openshaw's disappearance

24:39.910 --> 24:41.502
hanging over your head.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.770
I'm sorry, now you're
accusing me of murder?

24:43.810 --> 24:46.176
This is absurd.
We know that Openshaw

24:46.210 --> 24:48.678
was in contact with his lavwer,
Mr. Fordham.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.608
We know that
Fordham's office

24:50.650 --> 24:52.015
is not very far from where
this incident took place.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.950
As it turns out,
neither is the office

24:53.990 --> 24:55.719
of your campaign's
exploratory committee.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.909
So, it's not unreasonable
to think

24:56.960 --> 24:58.552
that you were in the area
for a meeting.

24:58.590 --> 25:02.048
I was champing at the bit
to take on Openshaw in court.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.068
That would have played well
with the voters.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.591
BELL:
Then let us see your calendar
from three weeks ago.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.858
Clear this whole thing up.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.663
I've done nothing but cooperate
with you.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.928
But now you're insulting me.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.198
Get out.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.187
WATSON:
You believe a word she says?

25:25.650 --> 25:27.550
Angela White.

25:27.590 --> 25:28.989
It's a well documented
enough phenomenon.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.248
A witness confuses a face

25:30.290 --> 25:34.898
they've seen in another context
with one concerned with a crime.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.694
Never the less,
I have my doubts.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.094
There's something else I wanted
to talk to you about.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.300
Marcus and I were talking
yesterday

25:44.340 --> 25:45.705
about Kitty.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.037
Oh?

25:47.070 --> 25:48.879
Yeah, we both
had a few concerns,

25:48.910 --> 25:50.207
so I decided to run
a background check.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.845
Was there some question
you didn't think

25:52.880 --> 25:54.279
you could simply ask me?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.719
Well, I'm asking you now.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.012
Were you aware that her records

25:57.050 --> 25:59.041
in the UK.
only date back five years?

25:59.090 --> 26:00.978
Before then,
Kitty Winter didn't exist.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.988
I told you,
her given name is Kathryn.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.658
You honestly think
I didn't look into that, too?

26:04.690 --> 26:06.920
You knew, didn't you?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.019
Did you think I would just place
an ad in the classifieds,

26:09.060 --> 26:11.893
"Detective seeks protge,
no questions asked"?

26:11.930 --> 26:14.069
Is she a_ criminal?
Certainly not.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.032
Then what is she?

26:15.070 --> 26:16.833
What have you gotten
Captain Gregson into?

26:16.870 --> 26:18.235
This chance encounter between
Miss White and Openshaw.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.670
It casts her withholding
of Fordham's surveillance

26:20.710 --> 26:22.974
in a new light,
does it not?

26:23.010 --> 26:24.079
Yes, I guess it does.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.975
It's likely her concern
had more to do

26:26.010 --> 26:28.319
with protecting herself
than Fordham's other clients.

26:28.350 --> 26:31.239
I think I know
who we should ask why.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.985
GREGSON:
Agent Boden,

26:33.020 --> 26:34.317
you were in charge of
the surveillance unit

26:34.360 --> 26:35.850
tailing Fordham.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.654
If you knew he was in
contact with Openshaw,

26:38.690 --> 26:40.999
if you knew Openshaw had
crossed paths with Ms. White...

26:41.030 --> 26:42.099
I didn't.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.222
She wasn't your boss,

26:43.260 --> 26:45.069
but she had a lot of pull,
right?

26:45.100 --> 26:47.125
Rising star
and all that?

26:47.170 --> 26:48.296
She didn't tell you
to back off,

26:48.340 --> 26:49.989
forget about what you saw?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.337
Hey, you've got this all wrong.

26:51.370 --> 26:53.099
Then by all means,
enlighten us.

26:56.840 --> 27:00.173
Your word you won't come
after me for any of it.

27:00.210 --> 27:02.019
Depends on what I hear.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.081
Angela's case was falling apart

27:12.130 --> 27:14.189
even before Openshaw
skipped bail.

27:14.230 --> 27:17.119
She would've lost
if it went to trial.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.367
I thought it was a slam dunk--
you guys had a paper trail.

27:19.400 --> 27:24.008
We did, but then, while her
office was preparing for trial,

27:24.040 --> 27:26.201
a file box went missing.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.208
And there was evidence in it.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.969
A clerical error, or something.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.443
We lost shipping orders,

27:31.480 --> 27:33.345
the memos that showed

27:33.380 --> 27:35.109
Openshaw knew the beads
were poison.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.947
Whole case gone.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.186
So, you're saying the government
just didn't

27:38.220 --> 27:40.085
have any evidence
to convict Openshaw.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.418
All the charges should've
been dropped then, no?

27:42.460 --> 27:44.451
When I heard about it,
I thought the same thing.

27:44.490 --> 27:47.027
But Angela
never even considered it.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.721
She couldn't,
it was too high-profile,

27:48.760 --> 27:50.899
and she was about to run
for office.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.363
If it had come out
that Openshaw walked

27:52.400 --> 27:54.391
because she lost evidence,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.067
the press would've
eaten her alive.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.067
Her political career
would've been over

27:57.100 --> 27:58.738
before it even started.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.260
Next thing I know,
Openshaw's in the wind.

28:00.310 --> 28:01.777
And when we start
tailing Fordham,

28:01.810 --> 28:03.971
hoping he'll
lead us to him,

28:04.010 --> 28:07.969
I see him and Angela having
secret meetings instead.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.215
In parking garages,
diners,

28:10.250 --> 28:12.184
these out-of-the-way places.

28:12.220 --> 28:13.448
You ask her about the meetings?

28:13.490 --> 28:14.559
Of course I did.

28:14.590 --> 28:15.659
She said she and Fordham
were talking off the books,

28:15.690 --> 28:18.250
trying to get Openshaw
to come in, so I let it go.

28:19.530 --> 28:23.193
But if you're telling me she
literally ran into Openshaw...

28:23.230 --> 28:27.018
I swear, I never could've
imagined she would kill anyone.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.395
I am an Assistant
US. Attorney.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.761
I'm going to have
your badge for this.

28:32.810 --> 28:34.903
Bank transfers

28:34.940 --> 28:37.477
between you and Openshaw's
lawyer, Fordham.

28:37.510 --> 28:39.239
You did a pretty good
job of hiding them,

28:39.280 --> 28:41.339
but, uh, they weren't
too hard to find

28:41.380 --> 28:44.110
once we knew what
we were looking for.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.186
(over intercom):
Theo Fordham knew exactly
what papers were seized

28:46.220 --> 28:47.881
from his client's office.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.888
When the memos that proved
his client knew about the beads

28:49.920 --> 28:51.524
didn't show up
in your court filings,

28:51.560 --> 28:53.892
he realized something was wrong.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.329
If he'd been a more
reputable lawyer,

28:55.360 --> 28:56.759
he would have gone straight
to a judge

28:56.800 --> 28:57.892
and gotten the case dismissed.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.022
But conscious of
your promismg

28:59.070 --> 29:00.423
political career,

29:00.470 --> 29:02.233
and knowing that
you couldn't afford to lose,

29:02.270 --> 29:05.103
he decided to blackmail you
instead.

29:05.140 --> 29:06.960
WATSON:
Why win one case for
a despicable client

29:07.010 --> 29:08.932
when he could have
a future congresswoman

29:08.980 --> 29:10.208
in his pocket instead?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.946
For his gambit to pay off,
however,

29:11.980 --> 29:14.778
he needed your political career
to survive.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.276
Openshaw's disappearance,

29:16.320 --> 29:18.049
arguably the least
embarrassing outcome

29:18.090 --> 29:21.116
for you at this point,
became mutually beneficial.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.184
GREGSON:
Go ahead.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.881
Give us some other reason why

29:23.930 --> 29:25.818
you were paying off
an opposing counsel.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.499
But remember,
we have the driver

29:28.530 --> 29:31.829
in the van who saw you
with Openshaw in the street.

29:33.070 --> 29:34.992
You're right.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.996
About most of it.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.359
Fordham was blackmailing me.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.970
We did agree to have Openshaw
skip bail.

29:41.010 --> 29:43.808
But I had nothing to do
with those murders.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.147
I transferred money
into the account

29:45.180 --> 29:47.239
I used to pay Fordham
yesterday morning.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.872
After he and Openshaw
were dead.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.342
I hadn't heard yet.

29:50.380 --> 29:52.814
Yeah, we noticed-- that
doesn't prove anything.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.351
No. But you're
obviously very smart.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.483
Ask yourself this:
Why would I do that?

29:56.520 --> 29:59.284
Just in case you accused me
of murder this morning?

29:59.330 --> 30:01.093
According to you,
I'd gone to great lengths

30:01.130 --> 30:02.495
to frame Gabe Coleman.

30:02.530 --> 30:03.997
Why not let that
play out?

30:04.030 --> 30:05.327
And while we're on the subject
of frame-ups,

30:05.370 --> 30:07.258
who pointed you in my direction?

30:07.300 --> 30:10.167
The FBI saw your secret meetings
with Fordham.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.201
Boden?

30:11.240 --> 30:13.333
Boden said he saw
the meetings?

30:13.370 --> 30:14.576
He was in charge of the
surveillance of Fordham,

30:14.610 --> 30:16.202
was he not?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.572
Yeah, at my instruction.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.305
I knew their schedule.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.238
I knew where they were
every minute of every day.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.339
What kind of an idiot
would I have to be

30:24.390 --> 30:27.018
to meet Fordham
knowing they were watching?

30:27.050 --> 30:29.189
This isn't a courtroom,
Miss White.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.482
We are not a jury.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.182
No. You're an officer
of the law.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.323
So I recommend _
you have a conversation

30:35.360 --> 30:39.023
with Special Agent Boden
as soon as possible.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.891
I never told the FBI about the
materials that went missing.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.237
So if Boden knew,
I have to think

30:43.270 --> 30:44.862
he was the one who took them.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.036
Why would he do that?

30:46.070 --> 30:47.503
I have no idea.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.371
But when you find him,
you might want to ask him

30:49.410 --> 30:51.275
if he had a reason for killing
Openshaw and Fordham.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.346
Because I didn't do it.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.248
Captain, a word?

31:08.500 --> 31:12.493
Easy to see why she enjoyed so
much success in the courtroom.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.191
Do you believe her?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.468
She made a lot
of good points.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.004
I propose a second visit
to Mr. Boden's home.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.301
Go, go, go!

31:23.340 --> 31:24.307
Clear!

31:24.350 --> 31:26.272
Two more left.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.402
Clear.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.211
ESU CAPTAIN (over radio):
All clear here, Captain.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.683
Looks like he packed in a hurry.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.188
He's gone.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.484
(indistinct radio transmissions)

31:49.340 --> 31:52.309
Captain said the FBI's
cooperating fully
with the search,

31:52.340 --> 31:54.205
but Boden has not been back
to his office, has not been

31:54.240 --> 31:56.470
in touch with his partner,
colleagues or family.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.705
Have a look
at this.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.344
Says he asked to be assigned
to the Pipz case

32:01.380 --> 32:03.541
after Openshaw
had been arrested.

32:03.580 --> 32:06.378
Mm. Sort of a strange time
to come on board.

32:06.420 --> 32:09.389
Not if the point was to gain
access to incriminating memos.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.229
The FBI handles the
transport of evidence to

32:11.260 --> 32:12.727
and from the US.
Attorney's office.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.318
So by getting
himself assigned,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.294
he put himself in
the perfect position

32:16.330 --> 32:17.968
to steal the files
from Ms. White

32:18.000 --> 32:21.458
and later find
and murder Openshaw.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.388
Do you think he was related
to one of the affected families?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.260
HOLMES:
Not according
to anything

32:25.310 --> 32:27.460
the FBI has shared with us.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.569
Well, maybe he
tangled with Openshaw

32:29.610 --> 32:31.009
and Fordham in the past.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.642
No record
of that either.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.046
You realize
that makes no sense.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.139
You're saying this man, Boden,

32:37.180 --> 32:39.683
stole the only evidence
against Openshaw, helping him,

32:39.720 --> 32:42.450
only to then track him down
and kill him months later?

32:42.490 --> 32:44.048
Why would he do both?

32:44.090 --> 32:47.321
That is the question,
is it not?

32:52.330 --> 32:55.231
Um, Kitty.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.504
I'm not allowed to look at the
Pipz the government seized?

32:58.540 --> 33:01.179
Of course you are.
It's just...

33:04.410 --> 33:06.241
I wish I had one
right now.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.248
A Pip.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.577
Or is it a Pipz?

33:09.620 --> 33:11.212
I'd take one.
Maybe two.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.185
Take myself
a right old nap.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.287
Sorry, he's an addict,
isn't he?

33:18.330 --> 33:21.151
Not supposed to talk
about drugs, certainly not right

33:21.200 --> 33:23.691
in front of him.
It's just I find it quite hard

33:23.730 --> 33:26.198
to keep more than a single
thought in my head at one time.

33:26.230 --> 33:27.766
Perhaps you should turn in
for the night.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.336
I'm gonna go out.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.603
Give you two your space.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.528
Let me know how it works out.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.775
(footsteps departing)

33:36.810 --> 33:38.607
(door opens)

33:38.650 --> 33:41.005
(door closes)
Come with me for a moment,
would you?

33:57.130 --> 33:58.495
How long has that been there?

34:03.370 --> 34:05.361
What is it?

34:05.410 --> 34:08.834
The answers to your
questions about Kitty.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.348
You want to know why her records
only go back five years.

34:11.380 --> 34:14.508
The truth is, she was a victim
of a horrific crime.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.745
It left scars.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.681
Not to mention a rather strong
desire for a new identity.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.587
What kind of crime?
She was taken.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.429
By a man.

34:24.460 --> 34:27.588
I didn't tell you
because she wouldn't want me to.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.292
She has no wish to be defined
by her victimhood,

34:30.330 --> 34:31.866
especially not here,

34:31.900 --> 34:35.267
where she is attempting
yet another new start.

34:35.300 --> 34:39.430
But since you've already run
your background check...

34:42.440 --> 34:44.442
The captain is aware.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.277
I told her he would have to know

34:46.310 --> 34:50.178
_if she wished to assist_me
in my work at the precmct.

34:55.490 --> 34:57.378
I'm sorry.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.126
Don't be.
I would've clone the same thing.
No,

34:59.160 --> 35:02.129
not about the background check.
I'm sorry about...

35:02.160 --> 35:03.627
whatever happened to her.

35:03.660 --> 35:07.221
She's strong, Watson. Smart.

35:07.270 --> 35:09.329
The training I'm attempting
to provide her,

35:09.370 --> 35:10.792
the same training
I provided you,

35:10.840 --> 35:12.705
for her has an ulterior motive.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.538
It is, in part, an attempt
to channel certain...

35:15.580 --> 35:18.845
residual feelings that she has
into a productive skill.

35:18.880 --> 35:22.372
I believe she will make
an excellent investigator.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.388
Just not today.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.393
She's right,
you know.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.557
It doesn't make
any sense.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.898
Why would Boden help Openshaw
get away with murder

35:38.930 --> 35:40.818
and then kill him
a few months later?

35:46.710 --> 35:49.270
What if the two events
you were describing,

35:49.310 --> 35:51.744
helping Openshaw
and killing him,

35:51.780 --> 35:54.271
were not part of the same plan

35:54.320 --> 35:56.447
_ but rather
two independent attempts

35:56.480 --> 35:57.913
to achieve the same effect?

35:57.950 --> 36:00.544
Which was?
An end
to the criminal proceedings.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.717
Stealing the memos should
have forced Angela White

36:02.760 --> 36:04.455
to drop the case.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.254
But instead it had the
unintended opposite effect:

36:07.290 --> 36:10.259
Fordham blackmailed
her, Openshaw fled

36:10.300 --> 36:13.497
and the case was _left in
permanent legal limbo.

36:13.530 --> 36:16.738
So Boden killed Openshaw
and his lawyer.

36:16.770 --> 36:19.637
With no one left
to prosecute,

36:19.670 --> 36:22.468
the case was brought
to a proper conclusion.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.671
But why would Boden care
about that?

36:46.430 --> 36:49.661
(sirens wailing)

36:57.680 --> 37:00.672
GREGSON (over speaker):
Agent Boden,
step out of the vehicle.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.515
OFFICER:
Stop right there!
Hands behind your head!

37:13.630 --> 37:15.791
HOLMES:
_ There's a term
in psychology Circles,

37:15.830 --> 37:17.593
"functional fixedness,"

37:17.630 --> 37:20.519
the understanding we develop
as the brain matures that

37:20.570 --> 37:22.458
a given object
has a given function.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.797
In layman's terms,

37:23.840 --> 37:25.432
it's "the right tool
for the right job."

37:25.470 --> 37:27.768
Creativity, on the other hand,

37:27.810 --> 37:30.608
is often defined as the freedom

37:30.640 --> 37:33.040
from so limiting
a cognitive bias.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.572
To his credit, Agent Boden
has shown remarkable creativity.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.612
Everyone else

37:39.650 --> 37:41.959
looked at the seized inventory
from Openshaw's company

37:41.990 --> 37:43.719
and they see a batch
of poisoned toys.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.456
Agent Boden looked
at the very same inventory...

37:46.490 --> 37:47.479
And saw millions of dollars

37:47.530 --> 37:49.054
in street value of GHB.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.056
HOLMES:
Drug evidence
is typically handled

37:51.100 --> 37:52.727
with very high security,

37:52.770 --> 37:55.534
even when it's being transported
for destruction.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.959
Because _no one else
saw the Pipz that way,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.604
Boden saw an opportunity
for making millions,

37:59.640 --> 38:02.529
simply by paying off a single
worker at a waste facility.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.933
All he had to
do to collect

38:03.980 --> 38:05.902
was get the government
to release the Pipz.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.874
Took him a couple of tries.
Killing Openshaw

38:08.920 --> 38:11.616
and Fordham
finally did the trick.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.917
You asked some good questions
last night.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.552
It's a shame
you weren't there

38:17.590 --> 38:19.683
when the solution
presented itself.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.595
If you're looking
for an apology...

38:21.630 --> 38:23.689
They say that genius
is an infinite capacity

38:23.730 --> 38:25.095
for taking pains.

38:25.130 --> 38:28.531
It's a very bad
definition,

38:28.570 --> 38:31.539
but it does apply
to detective work.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.765
You want
to be a detective, Kitty,

38:33.810 --> 38:35.607
accept
that you'll be taking pains.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.972
(siren wailing)

38:40.410 --> 38:42.617
*

38:47.590 --> 38:49.558
Sherlock around?

38:49.590 --> 38:50.454
Meeting.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.757
I'm taking the opportunity
to go through

38:53.790 --> 38:56.725
some of the work
you two did in the old days.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.894
Some good stuff here.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.874
Sherlock gave me
an envelope.

39:11.910 --> 39:13.639
He said
it would help me understand you

39:13.680 --> 39:15.819
a little bit better.

39:15.850 --> 39:18.887
Or at least who you were
five years ago.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.046
He told me.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.012
You had to see it.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.688
Same as the captain.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.955
Just the way it is.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.026
Actually, I haven't seen
anything. I didn't open it.

39:36.740 --> 39:39.709
I figured if the captain
has everything he needs then...

39:39.740 --> 39:41.935
you know.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.678
Anyway, I thought
you'd want to know.

39:46.710 --> 39:49.770
I'm supposed to run that back
to Sherlock now, am I?

39:55.220 --> 39:57.609
Just read it.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.724
The stuff that's inside, it's...

40:00.760 --> 40:02.022
articles, mostly.

40:02.060 --> 40:04.767
There's an
assessment or two.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.435
I want you to.

40:10.470 --> 40:12.631
Shedock
keeps saying

40:12.670 --> 40:14.479
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

40:14.510 --> 40:18.446
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

40:35.630 --> 40:38.019
*
