00:34.792 --> 00:36.957
Right, right.

00:44.834 --> 00:46.701
Do you have a list permit?

00:46.703 --> 00:49.040
No, no.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.941
Guess what? I heard about Nikki.

00:52.943 --> 00:54.609
Nikki, do I know Nikki?

00:54.611 --> 00:56.445
Yeah, from school.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.680
Oh, one boob much smaller than the other.

00:58.682 --> 01:00.881
Yeah, right, tiny tit, Nikki, exactly.

01:00.883 --> 01:03.818
Yeah, well, her husband's
quite touchy feely, right?

01:03.820 --> 01:05.754
How did you know all this?

01:05.756 --> 01:08.022
'Cause I spoke to her a couple weeks ago.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.726
Do you not speak to her any more?

01:10.728 --> 01:12.060
Yeah.

01:12.062 --> 01:13.894
Why don't you come on Friday?

01:13.896 --> 01:16.364
The girls do genuinely want to see you.

01:16.366 --> 01:17.698
They always ask about you.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.935
Yeah, and I want to see them, too.

01:19.937 --> 01:24.072
- Really? Do you though?
- Yeah, of course I do.

01:24.074 --> 01:26.841
I've sort of given up on people, haven't I?

01:26.843 --> 01:29.312
I've told you that, like, a million times.

01:31.648 --> 01:34.616
Sorry, I'm being a bitch.

01:34.618 --> 01:38.854
Yeah, you're being a bitch.

01:51.167 --> 01:54.835
So, this is amazing in every respect.

01:54.837 --> 01:57.506
Should we go to your place or...

01:57.508 --> 01:59.007
It's your place or no place, Jimbo.

01:59.009 --> 02:01.409
Awesome, but, awkward, my name's not Jim...

02:01.411 --> 02:03.778
- Shh.

02:03.780 --> 02:06.317
Make it so, Jimbo. Make it so.

02:10.654 --> 02:12.453

02:12.455 --> 02:16.090
No. It's just for, you

Consider me the manager.

05:44.801 --> 05:47.504

05:49.338 --> 05:51.239

05:53.643 --> 05:57.946
Good night.

05:57.948 --> 06:01.952
One, two, oh!

06:04.220 --> 06:05.420
All right, fancy pants.

06:05.422 --> 06:07.321
Are you coming out with us tonight?

06:07.323 --> 06:10.124
Nah, I'm just... I'm gonna
head in and have a quiet one.

06:10.126 --> 06:11.660
Been caning a bit lately.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.360
Oh, I lost my jacket.

06:13.362 --> 06:15.030
It's the one I just got.

06:15.032 --> 06:18.867
Oh, shit bags. You looked wealth in it.

06:18.869 --> 06:21.802
I know. Oh, well, it
was good while it lasted.

06:21.804 --> 06:25.006
All right, chica, I'll see you later.

06:25.008 --> 06:28.145
- Have fun.
- We will.

06:39.289 --> 06:41.458
Here you go, Francis.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.035
What have you done with your hair?

07:27.037 --> 07:30.771
Don't over react. I
didn't mean it like that.

07:30.773 --> 07:32.040
What are you doing here?

07:32.042 --> 07:33.775
Charming way to greet your mother.

07:33.777 --> 07:35.876
I meant to say what a lovely surprise.

07:35.878 --> 07:38.345
- No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

07:38.347 --> 07:40.448
Well, can I come in or are we going

07:40.450 --> 07:42.117
to stand here like lemons?

07:42.119 --> 07:43.350
Like lemons, preferably.

07:43.352 --> 07:44.819
Right.

07:44.821 --> 07:48.525
Here, I bought you a present.

07:50.227 --> 07:52.326
It's a mindfulness CD.

07:52.328 --> 07:54.828
This week mindfulness,
last week was it naked yoga?

07:54.830 --> 07:56.163
What's next week gonna be, Mother?

07:56.165 --> 07:58.833
Will you just open the bloody door?

07:58.835 --> 08:01.468
What I don't understand is,

08:01.470 --> 08:02.970
why couldn't you just phone first

08:02.972 --> 08:04.405
like a normal human being?

08:04.407 --> 08:06.508
What, so you can just ignore the phone?

08:06.510 --> 08:11.011
- Yeah.
- Jesus, why is nothing ever simple to you?

08:11.013 --> 08:12.547
Since you were little, exactly the same.

08:12.549 --> 08:14.517
No, no, no, no.

08:17.087 --> 08:19.853
God, it's hot in here.

08:19.855 --> 08:21.489
I don't wanna go.

08:21.491 --> 08:24.594
Look, you're coming. I don't care.

08:26.429 --> 08:29.230
You've gotta stop this.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.499
The heating's not on.
Anyway, Mom, I gotta go.

08:31.501 --> 08:33.703
Fuck off, will you, Daphne, I am boiling.

08:35.037 --> 08:37.674
- Okay, Mom, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.347
Just send me a cab.

09:03.133 --> 09:05.568
Oh, don't worry, mate.

Yeah, can you, um, can you ask the chef

09:26.455 --> 09:30.861

fresh chilies in the salad.

09:34.630 --> 09:36.766
I'm not picky.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.672
Yeah.

- Worth it though, isn't it?
- Correct.

13:10.747 --> 13:13.213
If you mean yes, just
say yes. Don't be a twat.

13:13.215 --> 13:16.319
That's what I meant, yes, correct, shut up.

13:22.325 --> 13:24.758
Hey, Joe, do you remember
when I asked if I could

13:24.760 --> 13:26.861
maybe... you know?

13:26.863 --> 13:30.564
What, babe, become a sous?

13:30.566 --> 13:33.834
Think you're ready?

13:33.836 --> 13:36.603
I mean, it's a massive responsibility.

13:36.605 --> 13:38.506
Do you know what it actually means?

13:38.508 --> 13:40.811
How it'll ruin your life.

13:43.245 --> 13:45.981
Hey, listen, I should get
back and finish my mis, yeah.

13:54.157 --> 13:57.458
Healthy cynicism and neurotic
cynicism are, like, different.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.495
And which one might you be?
Wait, wait, let me guess.

14:00.497 --> 14:03.564
The reason I mentioned it is
because you were kind enough

14:03.566 --> 14:06.567
to offer me some of your gak,
and then whenever I do coke,

14:06.569 --> 14:09.503
I always think about Freud, and
then whenever I think about Freud

14:09.505 --> 14:13.341
I always think about love, and you know
what Freud's definition of love was?

14:13.343 --> 14:16.376
I haven't got a clue, darling, what is
Freud's definition of love? Enlighten me.

14:16.378 --> 14:21.214
Freud's definition of love is, um...

14:21.216 --> 14:22.817
Oh, what was it?

14:22.819 --> 14:25.319
Oh, the psychosis of ordinary people.

14:25.321 --> 14:28.588
People like you, Tommy.

14:28.590 --> 14:30.491
Mmm.

14:30.493 --> 14:31.892
It's a sickness.

14:31.894 --> 14:34.462
You feel sick to the
stomach when it starts,

14:34.464 --> 14:36.463
and then you feel even sicker

14:36.465 --> 14:39.232
and it's even longer when it
ends, and then, that's called love.

14:39.234 --> 14:41.334
That's what we all want. It's fucked.

14:41.336 --> 14:43.637
- You talk a lot, don't you?
- No, I don't.

14:43.639 --> 14:46.741
So, what, are you gonna fall in love
tonight then? Strangers in London.

14:46.743 --> 14:48.543
Oh, what you mean? We're gonna fuck.

14:48.545 --> 14:51.179
Yeah, maybe, but what we're not
gonna do is fall in love, so...

14:51.181 --> 14:53.717
So you don't believe in
love, that's fucking awesome.

16:12.427 --> 16:15.998
Up up up up.

16:16.865 --> 16:18.966
- Come on.
- Don't. Fuck off.

16:18.968 --> 16:20.900
- Get up.
- What the fuck are you doing?

16:20.902 --> 16:22.402
Get up.

16:22.404 --> 16:24.174
I'll just pee in your mouth.

17:08.951 --> 17:12.953
Excuse me, where's any
mini cabs around here?

17:12.954 --> 17:14.753
Down that street.

17:14.756 --> 17:18.759
Okay, all right, can I also
grab some rolling backy?

17:18.761 --> 17:21.428
Just whatever's your cheapest really.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.732

17:24.733 --> 17:27.702
Oh, fuck. Thank you.

17:36.478 --> 17:39.379
I promise I will fucking stab you up, man.

17:39.381 --> 17:42.482
I ain't playing fair,
man. Get a fucking move on.

17:42.484 --> 17:44.518
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

17:44.520 --> 17:47.488
You can give me your money,
oh, come on, come on now.

17:50.359 --> 17:53.761
- What the fuck is that? That's fucking roll over.
- My mom gave it to me.

17:53.763 --> 17:55.628
Oh, my... my mom gave...

17:55.630 --> 17:57.431

19:12.675 --> 19:13.973

19:55.984 --> 19:59.220
Um, 20, um...

19:59.222 --> 20:02.655
Uh, no, I'm 30... 31.

20:02.657 --> 20:05.394

- All right.

20:47.203 --> 20:50.738
This is Deputy PC Curtis,
I'm calling to let you know

20:52.641 --> 20:54.107
you're entitled to counseling.

20:54.109 --> 20:56.246
If you could give me a call...

21:03.552 --> 21:05.319
All right, people, we got covers in,

21:05.321 --> 21:07.288
let's pump it out.

21:07.290 --> 21:10.156

21:57.872 --> 21:59.205
Don't give me that bullshit.

21:59.207 --> 22:00.773
You can't call someone's beliefs bullshit.

22:00.775 --> 22:03.242
You're just saying it to sound cool.

22:03.244 --> 22:06.713
Internet dating is consumers
are masquerading as love...

22:06.715 --> 22:09.015
- What part of that sounds cool?
- Ooh. Look at me,

22:09.017 --> 22:12.251
I've read Slavoj Zizek
and think I'm really cool.

22:12.253 --> 22:14.154
How... how did you just say...

22:14.156 --> 22:16.322
Do you even know who Slavoj Zizek is?

22:16.324 --> 22:19.893
Yeah, of course, I fucking do.

22:19.895 --> 22:23.062
Did you just Google him because
I mentioned him last week?

22:23.064 --> 22:24.298
You did, didn't you?

22:24.300 --> 22:25.965
Go on, say his name again.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.667
No, I didn't. Slavoj Zizek.

22:29.237 --> 22:31.204
Rubbish.

22:31.206 --> 22:33.406
- Slavoj Zizek.
- Slavoj Zizek.

22:33.408 --> 22:35.742
Anyway, these days it's
just... You don't even write

22:35.744 --> 22:37.645
anything about yourself,
it's just all photographs,

22:37.647 --> 22:40.880
just, like, there's no human interaction,

22:40.882 --> 22:42.683
it's like you're shopping. It's like this.

22:42.685 --> 22:44.652
Yah, yah, yah, fuck.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.953
Why are you even talking...
Who fucking cares?

22:46.955 --> 22:50.023
- Who cares?
- That's all it is.

22:50.025 --> 22:51.724
Yeah, you know, I agree with you,

22:51.726 --> 22:54.228
but like, what's love then?

22:54.230 --> 22:57.063
'Cause love and fucking
are different things.

22:57.065 --> 22:59.098
Ideally you need both.

22:59.100 --> 23:02.368
The love... the love bit
is a necessary illusion

23:02.370 --> 23:05.673
to bind us all together to
propagate our shitty species.

23:05.675 --> 23:09.143
No, no, that's bullshit. That's bullshit.

23:09.145 --> 23:13.180
Love and sex,

23:13.182 --> 23:16.015
you make do.

23:16.017 --> 23:18.121
It's whatever works.

23:26.328 --> 23:27.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:27.862 --> 23:30.165
Go home to your wife, Joe.

23:33.034 --> 23:35.301
Okay.

23:35.303 --> 23:40.309
Okay, I'll see you.

23:55.424 --> 23:57.257
Get off of me, get off.

23:57.259 --> 23:59.992
Easy. Just relax, pal, you're crazy.

23:59.994 --> 24:01.994
- What was that?
- Get off me!

24:01.996 --> 24:04.263
- Yeah, well, you promise you're gonna behave?
- Yeah, no,

24:04.265 --> 24:06.165
- yeah, yeah.
- Well, which one is it then?

24:06.167 --> 24:07.835
- Promise, I'll behave.
- All right, then.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.103
I'm gonna count to three.

24:09.105 --> 24:11.274
One, two...

24:13.375 --> 24:17.176
You, sir, are a fabulous cunt.

24:17.178 --> 24:19.047
Go home.

24:33.061 --> 24:36.195
Please, can I come back in?

24:36.197 --> 24:38.464
Go home.

24:38.466 --> 24:41.801
Hey, hey you, miss.

24:41.803 --> 24:45.505
- I don't wanna go home.
- Go home, you're pissed, yeah?

24:45.507 --> 24:47.840
- Hey.
- Yeah, don't try and sweet him.

24:47.842 --> 24:49.510
Don't try and sweet him.

24:49.512 --> 24:51.613
Ain't gonna work.

24:55.384 --> 24:59.288
- Lotta traffic.
- Fuck off.

Blimey, it should get wrinkles there.

26:42.323 --> 26:44.659
It's crashmania.

26:49.465 --> 26:53.602
Why, Lord, why me?

26:57.071 --> 26:59.342
Don't answer that.

27:01.209 --> 27:04.646
'Cause he can't see that I exist.

27:10.452 --> 27:14.323
I'm talking to myself.

27:16.558 --> 27:19.861
I'm such a wanker.

28:03.539 --> 28:05.271
I know it's just a small thing,

28:05.273 --> 28:07.139
but it does, it really annoys me

28:07.141 --> 28:09.742
that I have to pay so much
for these classes after school.

28:09.744 --> 28:13.113
Clarinet. Karate. It's ridiculous.

28:13.115 --> 28:16.015
All adds up. Do you know what I mean?

28:16.017 --> 28:19.720
And they don't even teach
them how to make music.

28:19.722 --> 28:22.491
Are we going on the lam, Daphne, dude?

28:25.660 --> 28:29.029
- Daphne?
- West Hampshire.

28:29.031 --> 28:30.530
Get your skates on, Daph.

28:30.532 --> 28:34.067
Hey, Beth, dude, he could
get hit by a bus, literally,

28:34.069 --> 28:36.002
any single day, so why
don't you just have a night

28:36.004 --> 28:38.305
enjoy the fuck out of
your kid while you can.

28:38.307 --> 28:41.174
Hey, Daphne, dude, why don't you
mind your own fucking business?

28:41.176 --> 28:43.577
I would, but you talk shit the whole time.

28:43.579 --> 28:45.578
And unfortunately, I'm not fucking deaf.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.481
That's a horrible thing to say.

28:47.483 --> 28:50.017
My brother's deaf.

28:50.019 --> 28:53.486
- No, he is not.
- Yes, he is.

28:53.488 --> 28:56.423
Okay, fine, well, so, fucking stab me.

28:56.425 --> 28:59.594
I'm just trying to fucking...

29:03.498 --> 29:05.667
I'm going to get some fresh air.

29:31.159 --> 29:36.562
- You busy?
- No, I'm doing the vat for a laugh.

29:36.564 --> 29:40.399
- Okay, you're busy.
- Yeah, why?

29:40.401 --> 29:42.168
Just chilling.

29:42.170 --> 29:46.705
Never illing. In my
mouth I got two fillings.

29:46.707 --> 29:48.443
Whatever.

29:51.179 --> 29:53.548
Young MC in the house.

29:55.283 --> 29:57.651
What?

30:00.455 --> 30:02.521
I hear that ladies are
stalking that white truffle

30:02.523 --> 30:05.224
over from Piedmont again
if you want to pop down

30:05.226 --> 30:06.592
and bag some free samples.

30:06.594 --> 30:09.428
Yeah, I heard. No, you go. I can't.

30:09.430 --> 30:10.797
You get some if you want.

30:10.799 --> 30:13.767
No, I mean, if you wanted to.

30:13.769 --> 30:17.537
I'm not in the mood.

30:17.539 --> 30:19.438
I don't think Beth likes me.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.207
That's not exactly news, Daphne.

30:21.209 --> 30:22.475
No, it's not.

30:25.246 --> 30:26.812
Is there anything else...

30:26.814 --> 30:29.249
Look, I clearly can't have
a drink right now, okay?

30:29.251 --> 30:32.888
- For fuck sake.
- No, I was gonna say sorry.

30:35.756 --> 30:38.424
Do you remember the other night...

30:38.426 --> 30:41.861
Uh, if you wanted to, we could.

30:41.863 --> 30:43.998
Um...

30:46.801 --> 30:49.938
We can what?

31:41.822 --> 31:45.724
Daphne.

31:45.726 --> 31:47.961
Are you stalking me?

31:47.963 --> 31:50.496
I'm going to ignore that comment.

31:50.498 --> 31:52.898
Here, an invite for Sunday.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.402
Mom, I told you.

31:55.404 --> 31:57.736
Take it, seriously.

31:57.738 --> 32:00.941
You might really regret it if you don't.

32:00.943 --> 32:03.777
How can you use that?

32:03.779 --> 32:06.445
That is so... Even for you.

32:06.447 --> 32:08.815
It's all I've got to use.

32:08.817 --> 32:10.517
Mom, I'm not, I just...

32:10.519 --> 32:12.953
I disagree. You don't think.

32:12.955 --> 32:14.620
You do things unthinkingly.

32:14.622 --> 32:18.692
And you don't do anything,
and you think too much.

32:18.694 --> 32:20.859
Regret the things you did do, Daphne,

32:20.861 --> 32:23.064
not the things you didn't.

32:24.632 --> 32:27.533
Where did you hear that
crap, in a fortune cookie?

32:27.535 --> 32:29.603
Yes.

32:29.605 --> 32:31.404
See you on Sunday.

32:31.406 --> 32:33.708
We can have coffee and cake after.

32:42.384 --> 32:44.753
- Service.
- Fuck.

32:46.288 --> 32:48.891
Service, please.

32:58.934 --> 33:02.569
- What about yesterday?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

33:02.571 --> 33:05.704
Okay.

33:05.706 --> 33:08.575
Anything else you don't wanna talk about?

33:08.577 --> 33:12.982
- Not really, no.
- No? Off you go.

33:17.718 --> 33:21.354
Do you think I'm selfish?

33:21.356 --> 33:23.423
- Yeah.
- Do you?

33:23.425 --> 33:25.692
Of course you are.

33:25.694 --> 33:28.627
So am I.

33:28.629 --> 33:31.798
I mean, who else is gonna look out for you?

33:31.800 --> 33:34.934
It's a tough fucking world.

33:34.936 --> 33:37.636
You gotta be tough, as well.

33:37.638 --> 33:41.808
Or at least, I don't know,
what the fuck do I know?

33:41.810 --> 33:43.676
Don't listen to me.

33:43.678 --> 33:48.682
Yeah, that's what I think, too.

33:48.684 --> 33:53.088
- But maybe...
- What?

33:54.790 --> 33:56.822
When you were a kid, did you ever wish

33:56.824 --> 33:59.826
that you'd be in a car crash
and both your parents would die,

33:59.828 --> 34:02.628
but you'd survive, and then you'd
be like this tragic little figure

34:02.630 --> 34:05.365
and everyone would love you or something?

34:05.367 --> 34:06.965
Did you ever wish for
that when you were a kid

34:06.967 --> 34:09.569
for both your parents to die?

34:09.571 --> 34:11.940
No, you fucking weirdo.

34:14.509 --> 34:19.746
I never wanted to have
kids. They just arrived.

34:19.748 --> 34:23.483
And so you just get on with it.

34:23.485 --> 34:25.819
Sometimes I wish I could
get a refund though.

34:25.821 --> 34:28.020
It sucks because we're both evil fuck ups.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.857
Yeah.

34:31.692 --> 34:34.460
I gotta quit this shit.
It's ruining my palate.

34:34.462 --> 34:36.864
I know, mine, too.

35:00.455 --> 35:04.858
Oh, God.

35:04.860 --> 35:07.696
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

35:22.177 --> 35:24.313
No.

35:52.674 --> 35:54.343
Sorry.

35:55.643 --> 35:58.610
Hello again.

35:58.612 --> 36:00.679
The one who kicked you out at the club

36:00.681 --> 36:01.980
a few nights ago.

36:01.982 --> 36:03.483
You called me a fabulous cunt.

36:03.485 --> 36:05.018
- Oh.
- Yeah.

36:05.020 --> 36:07.887
- Oh, amazing, fantastic.
- Well, I don't know about that.

36:07.889 --> 36:09.956
- Yeah, no, it's not fantastic.
- It was a mixed insult at least

36:09.958 --> 36:12.458
very uncharacteristic behavior of me.

36:12.460 --> 36:15.128
- Yeah, yeah, that's the feeling I got.
- Normally I'm much more, um...

36:15.130 --> 36:17.496
Pregnant?

36:17.498 --> 36:18.730
- What?
- Sorry.

36:18.732 --> 36:21.567
God, idiot, no. It's just the vitamins.

36:21.569 --> 36:24.770
- None of my... sorry.
- No! No, no, no, no, no.

36:24.772 --> 36:26.572
Sorry, probably looked like
I was about to stab you.

36:26.574 --> 36:28.907
No, I've seen worse, believe me.

36:28.909 --> 36:31.878
Yeah, I just find it weird
what manufacturers think

36:31.880 --> 36:34.980
that pregnant women need
but other women don't.

36:34.982 --> 36:37.750
Who's to say I could be doing with more

36:37.752 --> 36:39.953
selenium and magnesium.

36:39.955 --> 36:42.054
Getting all the good shit.

36:42.056 --> 36:46.625
Hey, I feel like I'm pregnant with
anxiety. I need the good shit, too.

36:46.627 --> 36:48.494
Right, I mean, no, I know, it's so unfair,

36:48.496 --> 36:50.195
I mean, I was just gonna say
that if you were pregnant,

36:50.197 --> 36:52.764
perhaps instead of all the
Vodka Red Bull you drank,

36:52.766 --> 36:55.969
it might be better to just stick
to the vodka, slightly, you know?

36:55.971 --> 36:58.837
Healthier.

36:58.839 --> 37:00.706
What did you say your name was?

37:00.708 --> 37:02.041
Didn't.

37:02.043 --> 37:05.578
Hmm.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.179
Is this is like a Mexican standoff?

37:07.181 --> 37:09.681
Well, that would be if we were
pointing guns at each other.

37:09.683 --> 37:11.784
- Are you allowed to carry a gun as a bouncer?
- Are you gonna ask me my name

37:11.786 --> 37:13.520
- or am I just gonna tell it to you?
- You haven't asked me my name.

37:13.522 --> 37:16.188
It's Daphne, according to
what you broadcast at a bar.

37:16.190 --> 37:19.659
- Amongst other things.
- Oh, God.

37:19.661 --> 37:21.126
What's your bloody name then?

37:21.128 --> 37:23.061
It's David.

37:23.063 --> 37:25.898
Hmm. Doesn't suit you.

37:25.900 --> 37:28.268
Well, pleased to meet you,
David, for the first time.

37:28.270 --> 37:30.637
Yeah, for the first time, definitely.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.206
Pleased to meet you, too, Daphne.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.708
Oh! No need to show off
with your fricking handshake.

37:39.980 --> 37:45.250
- So listen, I was...
- You were about to ask me for my number.

37:45.252 --> 37:47.219
I mean, that's very
forward of you to offer it.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.322
- But sure, if I can get your number then.
- I was just about to say

37:49.324 --> 37:52.625
- I'd rather you didn't, actually, sorry. Now go.
- Right, no, it is.

37:52.627 --> 37:54.893
50 grams of Pecorino.
You seem like a nice guy.

37:54.895 --> 37:56.262
No, no, no, no explanation needed.

37:56.264 --> 37:58.730
Anyway, nice to meet you again, Daphne.

37:58.732 --> 38:01.867
I mean, for the first time.

38:01.869 --> 38:03.938
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

38:09.777 --> 38:11.210
Cheers.

38:11.212 --> 38:13.145
Hi. How are you?

38:13.147 --> 38:15.081
- All right?
- Cooking, are you?

38:15.083 --> 38:16.385
Yeah.

38:22.924 --> 38:25.692
That is 10 pounds 20, please.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.025
- Yup.
- Hi.

38:27.027 --> 38:29.362
- Sorry, me again.
- Well, hello, again.

38:29.364 --> 38:32.130
Hi, listen, look. I know you
don't wanna give me your number

38:32.132 --> 38:34.733
and that's fine, absolutely,
but I'm gonna give you

38:34.735 --> 38:37.270
my number and you don't have to call it,

38:37.272 --> 38:39.706
but I just thought fuck
it... You know life's...

38:39.708 --> 38:44.309
- Short arse.
- Yeah, so, there you go, that's...

38:44.311 --> 38:46.012
Sorry about this.

38:46.014 --> 38:49.282
Is he bothering you? Are
you pestering this woman?

38:49.284 --> 38:51.083
You are.

38:51.085 --> 38:53.920
Yeah, he is, actually.
He's being a pest, yeah.

38:53.922 --> 38:56.054
Go on, get out of the shop.

38:56.056 --> 38:58.291
Yeah, go on, mate. Get out. Be gone.

38:58.293 --> 39:01.094
All right, all right. All
right, I'm going. I'm gone. See?

39:01.096 --> 39:03.128
- I'm gone.
- Idiot.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.797
Get out of here, idiot.

39:04.799 --> 39:08.400
See you, mate.

39:08.402 --> 39:09.869
Do you want a receipt?

39:09.871 --> 39:11.304
- Uh, no.
- All right.

39:11.306 --> 39:13.639
- I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
- Bye.

39:13.641 --> 39:15.510
Bye.

39:42.337 --> 39:44.170
All right, Beth.

39:44.172 --> 39:48.340
Oh, no, I'm not feeling
well. I'm not coming in today.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.411
All right.

39:51.980 --> 39:55.350
Oh, just, I'm just not feeling well.

39:58.987 --> 40:00.719
Have you told Joe?

40:00.721 --> 40:02.990
Yeah, I realize that.

40:16.036 --> 40:17.837
Please, take a seat.

40:17.839 --> 40:19.072
What do I call ya?

40:19.074 --> 40:21.107
Doctor or mister?

40:21.109 --> 40:23.976
Adam's fine.

40:23.978 --> 40:28.246
You don't look like an Adam.

40:28.248 --> 40:29.949
So, are you Italian?

40:29.951 --> 40:31.918
I mean, of Italian decent?

40:31.920 --> 40:33.319
Jewish.

40:33.321 --> 40:35.487
Oh, yeah. Doesn't make sense.

40:35.489 --> 40:37.322
Oh, sorry, was I being anti-semitic?

40:37.324 --> 40:39.858
Should I go out and come back in again?

40:39.860 --> 40:42.094
You were referred through
the Metropolitan Police

40:42.096 --> 40:45.398
as part of their victim's support scheme.

40:45.400 --> 40:49.735
I understand you were
witness to a violent assault.

40:49.737 --> 40:53.206
Perhaps you could start by
saying something about that?

40:53.208 --> 40:57.944
About what sort of emotions
that brought up for you?

40:57.946 --> 41:00.246
Certain emotions?

41:00.248 --> 41:02.047
Mmm...

41:02.049 --> 41:05.653
Things effect us in ways
we don't always expect.

41:08.022 --> 41:10.757
Do you think that it's
true that we're just matter?

41:10.759 --> 41:13.893
That we just die, and that's it?

41:13.895 --> 41:15.427
Or the whole heaven and hell thing,

41:15.429 --> 41:19.331
that those are basic two choices?

41:19.333 --> 41:23.268
Is that something you think about a lot?

41:23.270 --> 41:25.337
Sorry, you don't actually
know me or my life,

41:25.339 --> 41:28.007
or anything about me, do you?

41:28.009 --> 41:32.078
And are there people in
your life who do, Daphne?

41:32.080 --> 41:34.682
Who... who do know you?

41:36.217 --> 41:39.985
Why have you got every copy of
"Harry Potter" on your shelf?

41:39.987 --> 41:42.020
It must have been very difficult for you

41:42.022 --> 41:45.291
to have witnessed someone be stabbed.

41:45.293 --> 41:48.226
How do you think you're
coping with it, Daphne?

41:48.228 --> 41:50.529
What sort of question is that?
How do you think I'm coping?

41:50.531 --> 41:53.565
Seriously, why have you got
every copy of "Harry Potter"?

41:53.567 --> 41:55.967
That's... I'm not the one that's nuts,

41:55.969 --> 41:58.139
you're the one that's crazy.

42:09.217 --> 42:11.050
Excuse us, sorry.

42:11.052 --> 42:12.884
Would you mind getting that for me?

42:12.886 --> 42:16.188
- It's all right. It's miles away.
- Thank you.

42:16.190 --> 42:17.824
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.828
You're welcome.

42:26.835 --> 42:31.204
- And how are you?
- Oh, yeah. Not bad, thanks.

42:31.206 --> 42:33.338
You know how it is. Back's killing me.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.007
This one weighs a right old ton.

42:35.009 --> 42:36.208
Don't you?

42:36.210 --> 42:38.412
You do, don't you?

42:41.949 --> 42:46.052
And you? How are you?

42:46.054 --> 42:48.487
Oh...

42:48.489 --> 42:51.556
Oh, you know... I'm not so good, actually.

42:51.558 --> 42:55.027
Not so good.

42:55.029 --> 42:58.530
Yeah, I saw... I saw
something quite fucked up

42:58.532 --> 43:01.933
a few nights ago, that I wish I hadn't.

43:01.935 --> 43:04.971
Yeah, it's really pissed me off, actually.

43:04.973 --> 43:07.505
- Oh, sorry, swearing.
- Mmm.

43:07.507 --> 43:10.009
Close your ears. Don't
repeat anything I just said.

43:11.946 --> 43:14.079
I know, I'm fucking hilarious.

43:14.081 --> 43:17.016
- God, sorry, I'm terrible.
- Yeah, you are terrible.

43:17.018 --> 43:20.152
Well, my life's terrible.

43:20.154 --> 43:22.020
I haven't shaved my legs in months.

43:22.022 --> 43:24.290
Look. Well, I'm still wearing a sports bra

43:24.292 --> 43:26.391
'cause it can be us, so...

43:26.393 --> 43:28.261
Basically given up all my life, really.

43:28.263 --> 43:31.063
- Well, you might as well Jack it all in.
- Yeah, I know.

43:31.065 --> 43:33.532
Now my old hatchet-faced
mom's got cancer, as well.

43:33.534 --> 43:37.369
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Just laugh away.

43:37.371 --> 43:38.904
I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm laughing.

43:38.906 --> 43:40.639
No, I don't know why you're laughing.

43:40.641 --> 43:42.974
- That's not really funny, you know?
- Stop it, you'll make me laugh.

43:42.976 --> 43:44.376
You're making yourself laugh.

43:44.378 --> 43:46.311
It's not helping. My mom still has cancer.

43:46.313 --> 43:47.913
Your mom don't have cancer.

43:47.915 --> 43:50.949
She does actually. Sorry.

43:50.951 --> 43:55.121
Sorry, we probably shouldn't
have made a joke about that.

43:55.123 --> 43:57.223
Oh, that's all right. Don't be sorry.

43:57.225 --> 43:59.494
I just don't know what to say, really.

44:10.003 --> 44:12.538
It's my stop coming up.

44:12.540 --> 44:14.206
Well, I hope your back gets better.

44:14.208 --> 44:15.373
Yeah, thank you.

44:15.375 --> 44:17.677
Bye, mate.

44:17.679 --> 44:19.781
I hope your mom's all right.

44:59.386 --> 45:02.454
David Desilver, Security, hello?

45:18.072 --> 45:19.975
Give it a chance.

45:25.145 --> 45:27.346
Don't say a word.

45:39.092 --> 45:43.195
That's not cynical. It's
called being realistic.

45:43.197 --> 45:45.764
You don't believe in love?

45:45.766 --> 45:48.433
When you put it like that,
that sounds negative, yes.

45:48.435 --> 45:50.770
No, no, no, I know what you're saying.

45:50.772 --> 45:52.704
All I'm saying is that so
much of what's called love

45:52.706 --> 45:54.773
is really just people
projecting their own ideas

45:54.775 --> 45:57.409
of what a love object should
look like onto someone else,

45:57.411 --> 45:59.277
and then getting upset
when that person fails

45:59.279 --> 46:00.779
to live up to those expectations,

46:00.781 --> 46:03.315
so then they fall in
love with someone else,

46:03.317 --> 46:06.085
until they disappoint them, too.

46:06.087 --> 46:07.619
Right, so, basically, it turns out

46:07.621 --> 46:09.690
I didn't know what you were saying.

46:12.793 --> 46:15.061
I don't know why I just
said any of that stuff.

46:15.063 --> 46:17.630
I don't actually think any of
those things. I just said it.

46:17.632 --> 46:20.699
Well, aren't people basically being incapable
of a love that isn't self-interested?

46:20.701 --> 46:23.134
- No, that's good.
- It's to do with expectations.

46:23.136 --> 46:24.670
I don't want you to
expect one thing about me

46:24.672 --> 46:28.407
and then get mad when I'm not right.

46:28.409 --> 46:30.442
You... do you realize this is a first date?

46:30.444 --> 46:32.777
- Don't you?
- No need to be facetious.

46:32.779 --> 46:35.313
No, it's funny, it is.
It's like we're on a date,

46:35.315 --> 46:37.083
and you're basically saying
don't get your hopes up, pal.

46:37.085 --> 46:39.684
- No.
- Yes, it's like I've gone to church.

46:39.686 --> 46:44.723
I need to realize I've sat
next to Satan, it's funny.

46:44.725 --> 46:47.226
Here's the church, here's the steeple,

46:47.228 --> 46:49.661
open the doors... Ah,
and everyone's fucked off.

46:49.663 --> 46:51.699
Cause you're a twat.

46:52.532 --> 46:54.968
Wait, Daph. Daphne, wait.

47:00.607 --> 47:03.510
Sorry.

47:07.714 --> 47:11.550
- Oop.
- So should we go to your place?

47:11.552 --> 47:13.786
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea, do you?

47:13.788 --> 47:15.353
It you don't wanna have
sex with me, that's fine.

47:15.355 --> 47:16.788
No, I'm not saying I don't wanna have sex.

47:16.790 --> 47:19.190
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe I want a bit more.

47:19.192 --> 47:22.128
I'm saying, can we just cool it down
a little, see where things take us?

47:22.130 --> 47:24.295
Cool it down, who says cool it down?

47:24.297 --> 47:27.500
- Why are you so pissed? What happened to you?
- Don't try to psychoanalyze me.

47:29.737 --> 47:31.770
Well, do you expect me
to come back with you?

47:31.772 --> 47:33.572
I'm going back to the
bar to finish my drink.

47:33.574 --> 47:35.543
Come if you want, if not, whatever.

47:50.491 --> 47:53.759
That's some fucking serious, too.

47:58.431 --> 48:01.567
Just to sing about it.

48:01.569 --> 48:04.770
- Why it just releases.
- It's so easy.

48:04.772 --> 48:08.840
- Daytime breaks?
- Oh, yeah.

48:08.842 --> 48:12.610
Something to do with...

48:22.623 --> 48:28.626
So, I guess this is see you later?

48:28.628 --> 48:30.563
Or not?

48:30.565 --> 48:32.667
I'll call you.

48:44.878 --> 48:47.448
Yup, sure, whatever.

49:07.735 --> 49:09.601
Is that you?

49:09.603 --> 49:12.003
What I don't understand
is I made that spare key

49:12.005 --> 49:15.474
- a month ago.
- I made a copy a couple of months back.

49:15.476 --> 49:17.909
- And why did you do that?
- What happens when you kill yourself?

49:17.911 --> 49:20.411
Who's gonna let the police in?

49:20.413 --> 49:22.380
It's very late. Where were you?

49:22.382 --> 49:24.952
- Girl guides.
- Ah-ha.

49:29.389 --> 49:32.023
- Are you staying then?
- If that's okay.

49:32.025 --> 49:34.496
I'll just get you some bedding.

49:42.670 --> 49:45.270
So are you gonna listen to
what the doctor's telling you?

49:45.272 --> 49:46.904
You think they have all the answers?

49:46.906 --> 49:49.641
- They don't.
- It's like you've got some stupid death wish.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.876
I do not. I don't have a death wish.

49:51.878 --> 49:54.646
- It's infantile.
- I'm not dying, Daphne.

49:54.648 --> 49:57.449
I mean, not tomorrow, or the day after.

49:57.451 --> 50:00.418
Yeah, but it's still cancer.
Cancer's so fucking cancer.

50:00.420 --> 50:03.621
They took my thyroid
out. I don't have cancer.

50:03.623 --> 50:05.456
They said six months
in, if you needed to do

50:05.458 --> 50:08.694
another round of chemo,
then all this rubbish,

50:08.696 --> 50:12.297
that you filled your mind with,
this alternative bullshit...

50:12.299 --> 50:13.831
I just want to explore the...

50:13.833 --> 50:16.067
You can't heal cancer
with fucking mindfulness.

50:16.069 --> 50:19.837
- Daphne, stop it.
- If they did tell you to do more chemo, then do it.

50:19.839 --> 50:22.608
- That would be the positive thing to do.
- There are worse things

50:22.610 --> 50:23.976
- than dying.
- When did you become so naive?

50:23.978 --> 50:25.880
And when did you become so cynical?

50:28.581 --> 50:30.818
Can I have a glass of white wine?

50:32.018 --> 50:34.188
There's a bottle open in the fridge.

51:49.462 --> 51:51.764
Hey, Daphne. David here.

51:51.766 --> 51:53.799
Just wondered if you
wanted to hook up sometime.

51:53.801 --> 51:55.833
See you again. I'm very busy at the moment,

51:55.835 --> 51:58.436
but I'm sure I could squeeze you in.

51:58.438 --> 52:00.374
Daphne, just give me a call back, yeah.

52:53.027 --> 52:55.527
The second bedroom is like tiny,

52:55.529 --> 52:58.029
but you'll literally not
gonna find anything better.

52:58.031 --> 53:00.699
Not for that sort of money.

53:00.701 --> 53:03.101
So your friend, Izzy, then, she's nice?

53:03.103 --> 53:04.969
Yeah, she's sweet.

53:04.971 --> 53:07.038
Is it serious, then, is it?

53:07.040 --> 53:08.607
What do you mean?

53:08.609 --> 53:10.211
Nothing.

53:11.946 --> 53:15.514
It's like you wanted
to go out or something.

53:15.516 --> 53:17.148
You are so full of shit sometimes.

53:17.150 --> 53:18.784
It's not even funny anymore.

53:18.786 --> 53:20.652
Sorry.

53:20.654 --> 53:22.054
That's not funny.

53:22.056 --> 53:25.056
You wind me up. You know it does.

53:25.058 --> 53:28.626
I told you one thing once.

53:36.871 --> 53:40.505
Yeah, I saw someone get
stabbed the other night.

53:40.507 --> 53:42.608
- Did you?
- Yeah.

53:42.610 --> 53:44.842
Fuck off, seriously?

53:44.844 --> 53:47.813
London is crazy.

53:47.815 --> 53:51.282
Yeah, I know, it was like
we had to stop the bleeding.

53:51.284 --> 53:54.219
Did he, like, die?

53:55.989 --> 53:58.257
- Was he black?
- No, I don't... I don't know.

53:58.259 --> 54:00.125
- I mean...
- Cause after the ambulance came

54:00.127 --> 54:03.628
he either has black skin
or he doesn't, like...

54:03.630 --> 54:06.098
I imagine he does, like
statistically speaking.

54:06.100 --> 54:08.699
- Not being racist.
- No, I mean, I don't know if he died.

54:08.701 --> 54:11.603
Probably, but...

54:11.605 --> 54:13.938
Wow.

54:13.940 --> 54:15.907
You're tough as fuck they say.

54:15.909 --> 54:19.043
If Izzy saw someone getting stabbed,

54:19.045 --> 54:21.646
she'd basically move back to Wimbledon

54:21.648 --> 54:24.017
in a fucking flash, I'm telling you.

54:29.623 --> 54:33.724
- You all right?
- Yeah.

54:33.726 --> 54:36.831
- Shall we?
- Yeah, I should probably go.

55:52.639 --> 55:54.005
Here's the takeaway that you ordered.

55:54.007 --> 55:56.276
- Did I?
- Well, yeah.

55:57.411 --> 56:00.113
Wow. Take your word for it.

56:01.281 --> 56:04.017
Let me, let me, find...
Just come in a second.

56:05.752 --> 56:09.420
Let me find my...

56:09.422 --> 56:11.690
Just pop it on the table.

56:11.692 --> 56:14.262
My mind.

56:18.732 --> 56:20.165
Fuck.

56:20.167 --> 56:22.867
It's usually you, isn't
it? What's your name?

56:22.869 --> 56:24.735
My name's Kumar.

56:24.737 --> 56:28.239
Oh, well, Kumar, you are the
bearer of blessings, so many thanks.

56:28.241 --> 56:29.840
You can keep the change.

56:29.842 --> 56:34.012
Oh, cheers to that.
That's very kind of you.

56:34.014 --> 56:39.418
I... it's none of my business
or nothing, but are you okay?

56:39.420 --> 56:41.186
Uh, yeah, why do you ask?

56:41.188 --> 56:43.288
Oh, no reason.

56:43.290 --> 56:47.461
Okay. Well, thanks for, you know.

56:50.864 --> 56:55.000
I mean, you look like shit.
Sorry. It's not that you...

56:55.002 --> 56:56.701
It's none of my business.

56:56.703 --> 57:00.337
Yeah, um, you... You just said that.

57:00.339 --> 57:02.940
- Any other observations?
- No, no, sorry.

57:02.942 --> 57:05.876
- I should probably just...
- Yeah.

57:05.878 --> 57:08.279
Oh, Jesus, it's fucking
wet. Is she serious or what?

57:08.281 --> 57:12.349
You should probably just... I
don't know... Get some fresh air.

57:12.351 --> 57:15.721
- My mom, yeah.
- Yup, I really don't wanna know what your mom says.

57:15.723 --> 57:18.322
No, she says fresh air
is the best medicine.

57:18.324 --> 57:20.991
Wow, she's clearly a wonderful doctor.

57:20.993 --> 57:22.893
Hey, you're a joke.

57:22.895 --> 57:25.065
- All right, have a good night.
- Yeah, night.

58:12.011 --> 58:13.779
What's your name, old man?

58:13.781 --> 58:18.215
- Nacho.
- That's not your name. That's a snack.

58:18.217 --> 58:20.819
Make mine a double. What was I saying?

58:20.821 --> 58:24.922
You were talking rubbish,
and that is my name.

58:24.924 --> 58:28.125
Uh, well, exactly the
shit we find ourselves in.

58:28.127 --> 58:33.264
It's the shit of our own devising.

58:33.266 --> 58:35.833
Is there something on my face?

58:35.835 --> 58:37.134
Are you really 30?

58:37.136 --> 58:39.404
31. Why do I only look like I'm 18?

58:39.406 --> 58:41.072
I would have said 23.

58:41.074 --> 58:44.378
23 and two days. Something like that.

58:46.880 --> 58:50.047
So we're going back to yours then or what?

58:50.049 --> 58:52.050
What for?

58:52.052 --> 58:55.920
"What for?" He asks.

58:55.922 --> 58:58.056
You don't hang about, do ya?

58:58.058 --> 59:00.061
Go wait for me outside.

59:17.210 --> 59:19.311
Fucking like that. Do you like that?

59:19.313 --> 59:22.614
Yeah. Oh, say it.

59:22.616 --> 59:25.483
- Yeah, just get on with it.
- Say it, say it, say it.

59:25.485 --> 59:27.251
There you are. And you begged me.

59:27.253 --> 59:30.521
You fucking begged to come
back home with me, didn't ya?

59:30.523 --> 59:32.456
You and I.

59:32.458 --> 59:34.326
Fuck. You fucking woman, you.

59:34.328 --> 59:36.895
Oh, you fucking.

59:36.897 --> 59:39.463
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

59:39.465 --> 59:44.305
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

59:46.206 --> 59:48.242
Oh, Christ.

59:52.446 --> 59:54.311
Shit.

59:59.987 --> 01:00:01.789
For God sake.

01:00:32.552 --> 01:00:37.621
Listen, I have to give a
lecture in about an hour, so...

01:00:37.623 --> 01:00:40.925
Sorry, it's just, um...

01:00:40.927 --> 01:00:44.529
- Have you got any wet wipes?
- Wet what?

01:00:44.531 --> 01:00:48.635
- No, no.
- Never mind.

01:01:06.386 --> 01:01:10.256
Oh, David, mate, piss off.

01:01:25.672 --> 01:01:27.338
Hey, what can I get you?

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:30.375
- What you got?
- Everything.

01:01:30.377 --> 01:01:32.813
Oh, that's a start.

01:01:41.087 --> 01:01:43.556
I...

01:01:49.395 --> 01:01:52.398
I'll have...

01:02:47.686 --> 01:02:53.961
Uh, lunch, 2:00, fine. Is that okay?

01:02:57.663 --> 01:03:00.297
What are you doing in, Daph?
You're not in till later.

01:03:00.299 --> 01:03:02.669
Shh, I'm not here.

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:07.072
Hey, freckles? Are you okay?

01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:10.208
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:14.079
Daphne.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.779
As all you know, you're
all wonderful people.

01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:17.482
I love you all, I do.

01:03:17.484 --> 01:03:19.817
Well, it's a shit that I love you all.

01:03:19.819 --> 01:03:23.788
- Go away. Don't touch merchandise, you fuck.
- I've had it. Take it easy.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.425
Look at what you fucking made me
do, Joe. Look what you made me do.

01:03:27.427 --> 01:03:29.527
Okay, let's just take
them out of the kitchen,

01:03:29.529 --> 01:03:31.862
- and take it easy.
- I told you, Joe.

01:03:31.864 --> 01:03:34.833
Will you get the fuck out of
the kitchen, you silly cow?

01:03:34.835 --> 01:03:37.302
I am going to get the fuck out.

01:03:37.304 --> 01:03:39.170
And you're the biggest wank of them all.

01:03:39.172 --> 01:03:41.306
You're an enabler. You enable me

01:03:41.308 --> 01:03:44.775
to act like a twat, which
makes you an even bigger twat.

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:48.346
You're just take a Daphne
this and your Daphne that.

01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:51.148
- And shove it down your ruined shitty palate.
- All right, come on.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:53.820
I'd choke on it, you tit. I quit.

01:03:54.654 --> 01:03:57.557
- Come on.
- I quit.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:13.204
The beginning of the Reagan-Thatcher era.

01:04:13.206 --> 01:04:17.608
During this period we were introduced

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:20.612
to the idea of trickle-down economics,

01:04:20.614 --> 01:04:24.616
that by making the top
of the top as wealthy

01:04:24.618 --> 01:04:29.587
as we possibly can, using
fiscal monetary policies,

01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:32.489
that just would cause trickle-down,

01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:35.259
that a rising tide would lift all boats.

01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:37.462
Now here we are in 2016,

01:04:37.464 --> 01:04:40.364
with the widest wealth of
income tax around the world

01:04:40.366 --> 01:04:44.771
we've seen in hundreds of years.

01:04:48.475 --> 01:04:49.977
Joe.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.446
Joe!

01:04:58.418 --> 01:05:00.454
Here, it's hot.

01:05:08.427 --> 01:05:11.030
So yesterday was eventful.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.202
Please, come on. It'll do you good.

01:05:20.306 --> 01:05:22.840
How bad was I?

01:05:22.842 --> 01:05:24.342
Was I bad?

01:05:24.344 --> 01:05:25.909
I was bad, wasn't I?

01:05:25.911 --> 01:05:27.844
Well, how bad was I?

01:05:27.846 --> 01:05:29.746
I tried to help you and you said

01:05:29.748 --> 01:05:33.384
"Don't touch the merchandise, you fucker."

01:05:33.386 --> 01:05:36.286
You referred to yourself as merchandise.

01:05:36.288 --> 01:05:37.989
No, I didn't. I didn't.

01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:40.358
I'm such a dick.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.659
What else did I do?

01:05:42.661 --> 01:05:44.895
Don't tell me, but do obviously tell me.

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:48.134
Well, you quit quite a few times.

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:53.770
Hey, this is good.

01:05:53.772 --> 01:05:56.808
Yeah, I remember that bit.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:00.945
I take it I'm fired
though, now that I quit.

01:06:00.947 --> 01:06:04.349
You know that I'm in love with you, right?

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:09.887
- Fuck off, Joe.
- Yeah, I know.

01:06:09.889 --> 01:06:11.825
I am.

01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:16.930
I just wanted to say it just once.

01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:22.333
I'm actually for the better now.

01:06:22.335 --> 01:06:24.505
Good for you.

01:06:30.409 --> 01:06:33.878
You need to get your
shit together, all right?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.949
Well, you still got a job if you want.

01:06:37.951 --> 01:06:41.886
I don't know. I guess...

01:06:41.888 --> 01:06:45.025
That's funny, I don't care
about anything at the moment.

01:06:46.926 --> 01:06:48.960
Well, when you remember how to give a shit

01:06:48.962 --> 01:06:51.899
give me a call, okay?

01:06:52.998 --> 01:06:54.866
I'm not gonna come back, Joe.

01:06:54.868 --> 01:06:57.137
I'm out of it now.

01:07:02.475 --> 01:07:06.844
Well, you're not gonna
fall off a cliff, are you?

01:07:06.846 --> 01:07:10.681
We're still gonna hang out, right?

01:07:10.683 --> 01:07:12.718
Definitely.

01:07:41.348 --> 01:07:44.681
I'm sorry I was a tad
mental last time, wasn't I?

01:07:44.683 --> 01:07:46.451
Not really, no.

01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:48.853
Swerve and curve. I like your style.

01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:51.088
I'm a master of the old
duck and dive myself.

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:54.425
I'm very adept to ignoring
important questions.

01:07:54.427 --> 01:07:56.561
And what are they to you, Daphne?

01:07:56.563 --> 01:07:58.462
What are the important questions?

01:07:58.464 --> 01:08:00.530
Oh, my God, you're my hero,

01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:03.269
blew it right back in my court like a pro.

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.737
Yes, sweet, your smile
means you don't hate me.

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:08.641
Amazing.

01:08:10.509 --> 01:08:14.746
You, uh...

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:16.779
You asked me last time I was here

01:08:16.782 --> 01:08:19.917
what sort of emotions
the stabbing brought up.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:27.058
And I don't really feel

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.728
much about the guy. I
don't really care about him.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.162
Well, that's... That's not quite it.

01:08:32.163 --> 01:08:37.935
Just... I don't feel much.

01:08:37.937 --> 01:08:39.836
I'm not... that's not normal, right?

01:08:39.837 --> 01:08:42.140
And it... it only recently occurred to me

01:08:42.142 --> 01:08:44.073
because someone else mentioned it,

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.643
to check if he was still alive.

01:08:45.645 --> 01:08:47.010
And you know I got his address,

01:08:47.011 --> 01:08:48.912
and I was thinking of visiting him,

01:08:48.913 --> 01:08:54.085
but inside... Inside there's not much.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:57.154
What would a normal response be?

01:08:57.156 --> 01:08:59.957
What would it be to you?

01:08:59.959 --> 01:09:01.658
I don't know. That it mattered.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.661
That his life mattered.

01:09:03.662 --> 01:09:05.997
What about your life? Does you life matter?

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:09.000
I haven't felt like I'm
alive for a long time.

01:09:09.002 --> 01:09:11.705
I don't know. I don't know.

01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:15.973
You know, Daphne, we don't always feel

01:09:15.975 --> 01:09:18.509
what we might think of
as the correct emotions

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:20.478
at the correct times.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.645
That doesn't make us unhuman.

01:09:22.648 --> 01:09:24.747
You can still visit him
without necessarily having

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:27.850
great big operatic emotions about it.

01:09:27.853 --> 01:09:32.189
The action of visiting
him, that still counts.

01:09:32.191 --> 01:09:34.192
Our actions count.

01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:39.863
Even if we don't think that much of them,

01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:42.166
perhaps later on we will,

01:09:42.167 --> 01:09:46.737
but we don't need to wait
for that to do things.

01:09:46.738 --> 01:09:49.142
That's surprisingly good advice.

01:09:53.245 --> 01:09:57.747
You know, we might officially
have to inform the police,

01:09:57.749 --> 01:10:02.552
in case it affects any legal proceedings.

01:10:02.554 --> 01:10:07.024
But what I would like to ask
is why do you want to see him?

01:10:07.026 --> 01:10:09.796
Can you tell me?

01:10:10.963 --> 01:10:13.199
I...

01:10:15.701 --> 01:10:20.704
I'm just tired and I think that therapy,

01:10:20.706 --> 01:10:23.140
from what I understand
of it, is mostly bullshit,

01:10:23.142 --> 01:10:26.743
no offense, but I'm not
gonna spend months and years

01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:31.549
talking about what my mom
and dad did or didn't do.

01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:33.951
So, what would you like to talk about?

01:10:33.953 --> 01:10:37.054
I don't want to talk about
what I don't want to talk about.

01:10:37.056 --> 01:10:39.223
That's fine.

01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:41.926
And don't worry, these things take time.

01:10:41.928 --> 01:10:45.630
You can always come back,
even if it's bullshit.

01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:48.632
It's fine if it's bullshit.

01:10:48.634 --> 01:10:52.135
Bullshit can be useful.

01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:54.838
Do you mind if we don't... Can we not talk,

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.478
can we just sit for a while?

01:12:32.004 --> 01:12:37.140
Hey, um, I think you
gave me the wrong number.

01:12:37.142 --> 01:12:39.409
You see, I've been calling
you, but get no answer.

01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:41.345
Oh, that explains it. I was
wondering why you hadn't called

01:12:41.347 --> 01:12:43.381
- when you promised you would.
- Well there, it's bizarre,

01:12:43.383 --> 01:12:45.248
because when the phone
goes to answering machine,

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:50.086
a woman called, Daphne,
tells you to leave a message.

01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.389
I didn't expect to see you again.

01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:52.922
By the fourth time with no answer,

01:12:52.924 --> 01:12:54.391
I wasn't sure I wanted to.

01:12:54.393 --> 01:12:59.063
Yeah, there are things I
was... I am dealing with.

01:12:59.065 --> 01:13:04.135
Finish work in a few
hours, come back to mine.

01:13:04.137 --> 01:13:07.337
I don't know. I'm not
really in the same mood I was

01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:10.006
when I last met you. At least not sex.

01:13:10.008 --> 01:13:12.877
- I mean, not right now.
- In that case, maybe I'll take a pass.

01:13:12.879 --> 01:13:14.444
You were the one who said
you didn't want to have sex.

01:13:14.446 --> 01:13:16.680
If we're quoting each
other, what I said was,

01:13:16.682 --> 01:13:19.250
I didn't only want to have sex,
I might want something more.

01:13:19.252 --> 01:13:21.118
- What does something more mean?
- I don't know.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.491
It just sounded like a good
thing to say at the time.

01:13:28.928 --> 01:13:30.697
Oh!

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:40.304
Is it really bad that I find it
cheesy that you're holding my hand?

01:13:40.306 --> 01:13:43.343
No, as long as it's not bad
that I continue to hold it.

01:13:45.777 --> 01:13:48.746
Listen, David, I actually just came to say

01:13:48.748 --> 01:13:52.416
that I don't really want
to see anyone right now.

01:13:52.418 --> 01:13:58.021
Okay, okay, so how long do you think
I need to give you before I call?

01:13:58.023 --> 01:14:00.256
- Honestly, don't.
- I'll call you tomorrow, will I?

01:14:00.258 --> 01:14:02.993
- I've gotta go.
- Cool, let's chat later on tonight.

01:14:02.995 --> 01:14:05.296
Honestly, don't call
me cause I won't answer.

01:14:05.298 --> 01:14:06.896
So, I'm trying to have the last word.

01:14:06.898 --> 01:14:10.201
- You're being a dick.
- You're being a dick.

01:14:10.203 --> 01:14:12.671
What, is that it?

01:14:14.973 --> 01:14:17.009
Say at least one more thing.

01:15:00.052 --> 01:15:01.818
That which maintains all beings.

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:04.154
That which maintains all beings.

01:15:04.156 --> 01:15:05.922
Situated throughout space.

01:15:05.924 --> 01:15:07.957
Situated throughout space.

01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:10.027
So long as all have not attained

01:15:10.029 --> 01:15:12.328
So long as all have not attained

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:14.467
- to peace.
- to peace.

01:15:23.942 --> 01:15:26.211
Aunt Rita.

01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:52.536
Oh, Christ, I meant... sorry.

01:17:19.392 --> 01:17:21.358
The reason I get so pissed off by the chemo

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.395
and the mindfulness, I
don't want to lose you and...

01:17:25.397 --> 01:17:27.096
I know.

01:17:27.098 --> 01:17:29.366
Oh, no, that would have
been too hard on me.

01:17:29.368 --> 01:17:34.137
It's okay, cause, you know,
we don't know everything.

01:17:34.139 --> 01:17:35.572
Just, yeah.

01:17:35.574 --> 01:17:38.242
- Just, um...
- I know, I know,

01:17:38.244 --> 01:17:40.577
you're trying to apologize.

01:17:40.579 --> 01:17:44.314
Shit. Doesn't mean crap.

01:17:44.316 --> 01:17:48.051
Darling, you don't know what it's like

01:17:48.053 --> 01:17:50.186
to have to really,

01:17:50.188 --> 01:17:55.361
really have to face your
own... death, Daphne.

01:17:58.063 --> 01:18:01.265
I know I don't know. No, I know.

01:18:01.267 --> 01:18:04.501
I mean, it can't just be, oh, I don't know,

01:18:04.503 --> 01:18:07.637
you're born, you work, you
have a child, and you die.

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:12.376
It's not enough. I want... I
want more than that. I want...

01:18:12.378 --> 01:18:14.744
That's why I'm trying to, you know,

01:18:14.746 --> 01:18:17.784
before I'm not here anymore, I suppose.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.720
I forgot my fags.

01:18:24.623 --> 01:18:29.259
- Oh, fuck it.
- Yeah, fuck it.

01:18:29.261 --> 01:18:31.295
I'm proud of you, Mom.

01:18:31.297 --> 01:18:34.434
I know now that you're trying
it is probably a good thing.

01:19:48.574 --> 01:19:52.810
This delicious. How did you make it?

01:20:08.427 --> 01:20:10.426
My wife says because you are so skinny,

01:20:10.428 --> 01:20:12.095
she will write you the recipe.

01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:13.863
Normally she would not write it for anyone,

01:20:13.865 --> 01:20:15.666
because it is a family secret.

01:20:15.668 --> 01:20:18.702
But she says you are like the kitten

01:20:18.704 --> 01:20:21.204
that is so skinny that the whole village

01:20:21.206 --> 01:20:23.306
kicks it away.

01:20:23.308 --> 01:20:26.210
I don't see why is that
funny? That's terrible.

01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.577
She feels sorry for you.

01:20:27.579 --> 01:20:29.613
She... she... no, no,
it is more than sorry.

01:20:29.615 --> 01:20:31.881
How do you say it?

01:20:31.883 --> 01:20:35.487
It is the pity. She pities you.

01:20:43.495 --> 01:20:46.462
Are you Samir, then?

01:20:46.464 --> 01:20:48.198
Your dad wouldn't shut up about you.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.300
He kept saying your
name over and over again.

01:20:50.302 --> 01:20:55.171
"Samir, Samir."

01:20:55.173 --> 01:20:59.243
Oh, well, I mean, he
said all of your names...

01:20:59.245 --> 01:21:01.644
He was holding a photograph of all of you.

01:21:01.646 --> 01:21:03.412
And, yeah, crying and...

01:21:03.414 --> 01:21:05.649
Yeah, it was... it was...
It was... it was lovely,

01:21:05.651 --> 01:21:08.888
in a traumatic sort of way, you see.

01:21:18.797 --> 01:21:20.497
Please.

01:21:20.499 --> 01:21:24.467
Benny, I wanted to say that the other day

01:21:24.469 --> 01:21:26.537
I'm sorry because you tried to hold my hand

01:21:26.539 --> 01:21:29.273
and I took my hand away.

01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:32.509
I'm really sorry. I
should have held your hand.

01:21:32.511 --> 01:21:34.610
What do you mean, Daphne? You did.

01:21:34.612 --> 01:21:36.779
You took my hand. You held it.

01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:38.748
Have some more of this.

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:41.752
No, I do... It's not how I remember it.

01:21:41.754 --> 01:21:43.790
You saved me.

01:21:50.396 --> 01:21:52.296
And what about the boy who stabbed you,

01:21:52.298 --> 01:21:53.497
do you ever think about him or...

01:21:53.499 --> 01:21:54.931
Do you... I don't know,

01:21:54.933 --> 01:21:57.868
do you forgive him or...

01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.405
Yes, I think of him, but, no, Daphne,

01:22:02.407 --> 01:22:04.440
not yet. I cannot.

01:22:04.442 --> 01:22:08.377
No.

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:21.625
Daphne.

01:22:21.627 --> 01:22:24.229
You come into the shop. Come into the shop.

01:22:25.463 --> 01:22:27.898
- You wanted paracetamol?
- Paracetamol, please.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.734
...Paracetamol.

01:23:20.852 --> 01:23:23.088
...Daphne.

01:24:11.072 --> 01:24:15.971
