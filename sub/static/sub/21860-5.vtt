WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.536
Hey!

00:02.570 --> 00:05.073
If I buy you a drink,
does that mean
you have to go down on me?

00:05.106 --> 00:07.841
'Cause, you know, feminism.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.649
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.261
Mm.
Ooh.
(chuckles)

00:27.295 --> 00:30.198
How's Sam's acting career
going these days?

00:30.231 --> 00:32.700
Oh, I don't know.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.536
Just a bunch of bawdy bit parts
on her little cartoons.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.538
(laughs)

00:37.571 --> 00:39.707
I mean, she has a skill,

00:39.740 --> 00:42.076
but she's never sparkled
the way they do here.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.578
The way they need to,
to be taken seriously.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.914
Huh. Mmm.
(chuckles)

00:46.947 --> 00:48.849
It's a bit embarrassing,
isn't it?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.351
And yet she lords it

00:50.384 --> 00:53.121
over us all as if
she's Elizabeth Taylor.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.423
Lords it over you?

00:55.456 --> 00:57.691
You should see the way
she talks.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.793
(imitates Sam): "I need you
to help me with the girls

00:59.827 --> 01:01.862
so I can work."

01:01.895 --> 01:03.097
What a laugh--

01:03.131 --> 01:04.265
to call that work.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.766
Now, Gloria works.

01:05.799 --> 01:06.867
Yes, I do.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.136
How many houses do you clean

01:08.169 --> 01:09.403
in one day?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.605
I clean a lot of houses.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.040
Lord.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.608
And this little pig I raised

01:14.642 --> 01:17.611
complains "No one helps me."

01:17.645 --> 01:19.447
REPORTER: Tom and Harriet Banks
are the lucky...

01:19.480 --> 01:21.649
SAM (in distance):
Why does nobody help me?!

01:21.682 --> 01:24.252
The pair came forward
and claimed their...

01:24.285 --> 01:25.553
It's true.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.588
She's a stuck-up little pig.
Ooh.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.158
And she's got her fucking
father's Jewish features.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.294
My God, if I knew
I was going to have to

01:33.327 --> 01:35.095
stare into his face
long after he died,

01:35.129 --> 01:36.297
I wouldn't have had her.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.132
Hmm.
Well, you're blessed

01:38.166 --> 01:39.567
to have her, though.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.669
She's caring for you,
isn't she?

01:41.702 --> 01:44.238
And you should see her
hold that over me.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.739
Mom. Look.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.575
I'm happy to have you here

01:47.608 --> 01:49.076
so you can be near the girls.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.645
But you can't do pop-ins
whenever you want.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.681
I need boundaries.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.984
(footsteps departing)

02:01.522 --> 02:02.823
(door slams)

02:02.856 --> 02:04.658
SAM:
Sorry!

02:04.692 --> 02:07.428
The thing that's
so crude about her

02:07.461 --> 02:09.096
is that half of her wealth

02:09.129 --> 02:10.964
comes from when she was
working as a child,

02:10.998 --> 02:12.466
which is really a credit to me.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.168
Once she was on
her own, her career

02:14.202 --> 02:16.870
went south and she couldn't even
hold on to her husband.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.506
Sweet man.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.008
A really good boy
of northern extraction,

02:21.041 --> 02:24.378
but she chased him away.
Chased him away.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.214
Now she's raising
the three girls on her own?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.481
Well, if you
call that

02:27.515 --> 02:29.049
raising them.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.451
They're horrid.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.053
They're my grands
and I love them,

02:33.086 --> 02:35.389
but I only really like Duke,

02:35.423 --> 02:36.890
the little one.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.726
She's my special project.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.894
Just remember
not to repeat the mistakes

02:40.928 --> 02:42.796
of every female
in our family.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.065
Now, shh, this is a secret.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.402
Because you have a right to know
where we all went wrong.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.705
Now, I'm going to tell you
the worst of it,

02:51.739 --> 02:53.907
so you never
have to think about it again.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.249
I do

03:01.282 --> 03:02.850
love her so.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.385
Sam.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.687
I love all of them.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.089
That's always been my burden.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.559
I love too much.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.594
I forgive too much.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.231
(knocking)

03:17.265 --> 03:18.766
Oh.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.571
What?
Hi, Phil.
I need a minute with you.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.105
Hi!
You see?

03:26.374 --> 03:28.576
What?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.578
Mom. What is this?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.246
I'm sure I don't know.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.715
It says that you're applying

03:34.748 --> 03:37.518
to re-mortgage this house.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.420
Mom.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.054
This house is not yours.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.423
It certainly is.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.058
No. I bought you this house

03:45.092 --> 03:46.394
under my name.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.396
I'm already extended up the ass

03:48.429 --> 03:50.063
and I finally

03:50.097 --> 03:52.266
have some equity in this place.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.734
Go ahead and threaten me.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.569
So I'm canceling...

03:55.603 --> 03:57.271
Wh-What?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.772
Go ahead and threaten me.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.441
Take the house.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.075
Kick me out.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.377
Throw me on the street.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.212
Make me a homeless,
broken woman.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.580
Take my clothes,

04:06.614 --> 04:07.981
take my rings.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.350
You don't scare me.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
Phil.
Hmm?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.823
I'm just gonna step
around all of that

04:15.856 --> 04:18.859
and ask you to
never do this again.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.395
No.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.130
No.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.566
Thank you.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.000
Bye!

04:31.639 --> 04:33.641
Whatever you say.

04:34.975 --> 04:40.280
* Mother, you had me *

04:40.314 --> 04:45.085
* But I never had you *

04:45.118 --> 04:46.887
*

04:49.156 --> 04:53.026
* I wanted you *

04:54.695 --> 04:59.667
* You didn't want me. *

05:02.470 --> 05:04.472
*

05:16.249 --> 05:17.718
PHYLLIS:
If you'll follow me,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.553
I'll show you the
Caravaggio exhibit.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.355
Thought to be his
most important.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.624
You'll notice the resemblance
with the Impressionists,

05:23.657 --> 05:25.325
and yet he's
more disciplined,

05:25.359 --> 05:27.528
more concerned with
form than they are.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.029
Thank you.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.798
I think, maybe...

05:30.831 --> 05:33.501
we're gonna just look around
by ourselves instead.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.002
Sorry.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.070
Oh. All right.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.406
WOMAN:
Phyllis!

05:38.439 --> 05:40.674
Phyllis, come!
What?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.910
The Egyptian works
just arrived!

05:42.943 --> 05:44.945
(gasps)

05:47.180 --> 05:48.582
Oh...

05:48.616 --> 05:50.317
Wow.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.886
Oh, my God.
It's Usurpa.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.488
Which one is that?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.824
She was the first queen
to rule Egypt.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.593
They found her tomb,
and this is all hers.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.762
Come, let me show you
my favorite.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.666
*

06:05.699 --> 06:08.301
(laughs)

06:10.037 --> 06:12.272
Oh.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.211
How wonderful.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.947
(gasps)

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
Oh.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.753
Oh, Jennie.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.506
*

07:02.255 --> 07:03.757
I did put it back.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.259
(sighs) Phyllis.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.896
I saw you take it.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
I know.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.902
I don't know what to say.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.471
I never stole anything
in my life.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.972
You stole that ring.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.308
Doesn't matter
what you did before.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.176
And I saw you do it.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.916
I'm so ashamed.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
Man, this is...

07:33.954 --> 07:36.624
You volunteer here, Phyllis.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.993
And I don't want
to turn in an old lady.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.294
Maybe you should turn me in.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.796
Maybe it's best.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.365
Mm, mm, mm, wait,
hold on, hold on. Just...

07:45.398 --> 07:47.334
Damn it, hold on.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.369
I wasn't gonna keep it.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.508
I don't think.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.544
God.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.380
I just...

08:02.683 --> 08:04.685
I haven't been myself.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.690
Sometimes...

08:09.723 --> 08:11.725
I just don't know
what's going on.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.896
I get to the end of a day,
and I'm...

08:17.898 --> 08:19.900
...not sure what happened.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.871
Well, maybe if you...

08:23.904 --> 08:25.639
I...
I'll leave

08:25.673 --> 08:27.374
and never come back.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.310
Uh... (clears throat)
I'll quit my docent position.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.712
They won't care.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.380
No one will care.

08:35.549 --> 08:39.052
I'll leave here...
never come back.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.387
Phyllis?

08:40.420 --> 08:41.855
No.
Phyllis!

08:41.889 --> 08:43.857
* If you get lost *

08:43.891 --> 08:46.660
* In the fog tonight *

08:46.694 --> 08:49.529
* Will you cry? *

08:49.563 --> 08:54.668
* If you go out
and you cannot see *

08:54.702 --> 08:57.838
* Will you die? *

08:57.871 --> 09:03.443
* If you get swallowed
by clouds tonight *

09:03.476 --> 09:08.281
* Will you wake up
in your own skin? *

09:08.315 --> 09:12.686
* Or will you become
someone else, maybe him? *

09:12.720 --> 09:16.089
(keys jingling)

09:22.763 --> 09:24.164
(sighs)

09:28.135 --> 09:30.303
(scoffs)

09:30.337 --> 09:33.641
*

10:02.703 --> 10:07.641
* If you go out
and you cannot see *

10:07.675 --> 10:10.343
* Will you die? *
(sighs)

10:10.377 --> 10:15.082
* If you get swallowed
by clouds tonight *

10:15.115 --> 10:17.084
* Will you wake up *

10:17.117 --> 10:19.352
* In your own skin? *
(clicks tongue)

10:19.386 --> 10:24.692
* Or will you become
someone else, maybe him? *

10:38.005 --> 10:40.407
(inhales loudly
through nose)

10:43.643 --> 10:46.013
(humming)

10:48.081 --> 10:49.149
(yells)

10:51.551 --> 10:54.855
ROBIN: Yeah, she said she was
staying at her friend's house,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.990
but they just went downtown,
and they were up all night,

10:57.024 --> 10:58.558
I guess, clubbing.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.328
Oh, I know that story.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.663
(scoffs) I'm sure you do.
SAM: Listen,

11:03.697 --> 11:06.734
my girls want to meet you.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.169
Whoops?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.804
Too soon?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.073
No. No, actually, I was...

11:13.106 --> 11:14.241
What?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.043
N-No, it's nothing.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.644
Yes, something.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.179
I want to know
what you were gonna say.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.848
Look, you don't have
to meet them.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.415
I'm not putting pressure on you.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.151
Actually, I-I was...

11:24.184 --> 11:26.319
I was wondering
when you were gonna ask.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.189
I-I didn't want to be pushy
and ask to meet them, but...

11:29.222 --> 11:31.691
Oh. Oh, so I'm too late?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.693
No, no. Ugh.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.263
Sorry. Please.
I-I want to meet your girls.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.998
No. Forget it.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.399
Forget it now.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.768
They changed their minds.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.102
Oh, they did?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.570
Yeah.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.006
Forget the whole thing.
(Robin laughs)

11:46.039 --> 11:47.540
Okay, sure.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.909
Okay.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.178
Hey, Sam?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.780
Yeah?
I really...

11:52.813 --> 11:55.182
(beep)
Oh.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117
(beep)
My phone just went boop. What?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.418
No, I... I just said that...

11:58.451 --> 11:59.920
(beep)

11:59.953 --> 12:01.721
I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm getting a call.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.257
It's okay. Uh, take the call.

12:04.291 --> 12:07.060
Yes, I want to meet your girls.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.461
Okay.
Bye.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.263
Bye.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.698
Hello? Hi.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.067
Honey, do you still have
your old headshots?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.103
The ones
where you're wearing the hat?

12:16.136 --> 12:17.938
Oh. I don't know. Why?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.472
Well, someone wants
to put you in a movie,

12:19.506 --> 12:20.874
but you're dead the whole movie,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.375
so they just see a picture.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.412
And they want pictures of you
from earlier.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.780
Earlier?

12:26.814 --> 12:28.448
You mean younger?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.383
(beep)
SAM:
Oh. Wait. I'm getting a call.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.952
You have to go?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.587
I don't know this number.
I'm not getting it.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.589
Okay.
Okay.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.058
I guess I'll just look

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
for younger pictures
when I wasn't gross.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.129
You're not gross.
Don't say that.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.998
I'll say whatever I want.
I love you. How are you?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.233
Okay. I love you, too. Bye.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.268
Bye.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.943
MAN:
Hello, I'm calling

12:55.976 --> 12:58.078
for Sam Fox
from St. John's Hospital.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.680
Your mother Phyllis is here
in the emergency room.

13:00.713 --> 13:05.485
Please call us back
at 818-555-6943.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.554
(click)
Shit.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.693
Her ankle's fractured,

13:13.726 --> 13:16.796
and there is a dual fracture
of her fibula.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.766
SAM:
Oh, my God.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.669
She can't leave here
for about five days.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.672
And when she gets home,
she's going to need some care.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.540
SAM:
Phil?

13:27.574 --> 13:31.044
What happened?

13:31.078 --> 13:33.680
Did she tell anybody
what happened?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.148
Not that I know of,

13:35.182 --> 13:36.850
but I'll check back with you
this evening.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.352
Okay. Thank you.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.990
(sighs)

13:43.023 --> 13:45.158
Mom?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.995
Mom?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.432
(inhales sharply)

14:01.274 --> 14:03.510
Mom?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.112
Mom?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.982
I'm so sorry
you got hurt.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.920
What's going on?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.588
Are you mad at me?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.926
Why aren't you...?

14:18.959 --> 14:22.029
I want to go back home.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.567
I know that, kid, but did
you hear what the doctor said?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.869
You got to stay here
for, like, five days

14:29.903 --> 14:32.339
until your leg sets or whatever.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.443
I want to go... back.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.920
(sighs)

14:59.299 --> 15:01.734
It's okay.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.806
Want an ice chip?

15:06.839 --> 15:08.575
No.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.978
Just you.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.980
Okay, I'm here.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.582
(sighs)

15:17.150 --> 15:19.452
You want to watch TCM?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.857
Okay. It's right
over there.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.328
(inhales loudly through nose)

15:28.361 --> 15:30.097
(sighs loudly)

15:33.333 --> 15:35.768
(phone ringing)

15:41.874 --> 15:43.310
Hello.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.744
SAM:
Hi.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.913
Yeah, listen,
Mom is in the hospital.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.981
Oh, my God.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.416
No, it's not that kind of

15:49.449 --> 15:50.817
"in the hospital" yet.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.485
You can stay in Texas, bro,
but...

15:52.519 --> 15:54.287
we need to talk.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.923
Okay, but I would still
like to know

15:56.956 --> 15:59.292
why my mother is
in the hospital.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.827
Oh, would you?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.829
Then maybe come see her
once a year.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.197
Jesus.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.865
Yeah. Me, too.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.169
Listen, I need to figure
this out. I need your help.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.703
Okay.
Don't worry.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.639
I'm not asking you
to d anything.

16:12.672 --> 16:17.477
I just... don't... think

16:17.510 --> 16:20.213
I can keep Mom
in that house anymore.

16:20.247 --> 16:24.384
And she's gonna be in this
hospital for about five days.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.485
What happened to her?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.020
Broken foot, Marion.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.989
She broke her foot in about
50 places. Jesus.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.991
Please listen to me.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.360
I'm listening.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.628
I feel like I have
a window here.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.464
And I need to make a move.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.667
I want to...
find a home for Mom.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.703
(sighs)
A place to put her.

16:43.736 --> 16:47.006
Like a dying lady, lonely place

16:47.040 --> 16:49.909
where mean young people
put their mom.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.911
(sighs)

16:51.944 --> 16:54.914
And if I can find a place
while she's here,

16:54.947 --> 16:58.318
then I could-- shit.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.920
Like, ambush her.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.689
And take her there from here.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.091
Okay.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.226
So you need me to contribute
financially.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.528
No, I don't, Marion!

17:08.561 --> 17:10.430
You want me to help
find a place?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.732
No. Marion, I don't want you
to do anything.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.167
I got it.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.437
Then why are we talking
on the phone right now?

17:17.470 --> 17:21.374
Because I need you
to be part of this.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.277
I need an accomplice.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.679
I just need this to be
our decision,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.915
so I don't have
to carry all the weight,

17:28.948 --> 17:32.018
because... it's a lot.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.221
Okay.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.923
Whatever you need to do
to care for Mom,

17:36.956 --> 17:39.759
it's fine with me.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.528
That's what I needed to hear.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.397
Thanks. Bye.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.399
Hel-Hello? Jesus.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.401
*

17:48.435 --> 17:50.437
(groaning)

17:52.439 --> 17:55.142
When my dad was 80,

17:55.175 --> 17:56.943
he retired from his company,

17:56.976 --> 17:59.779
and then I had
to take care of him.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.250
Which was hilarious, because
he hadn't spoken to me in years.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.252
He disowned me when I was 18.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.553
'Cause of gay.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.655
Oh, no. He never
cared about that.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.991
(laughing):
No, no, no. He disowned me
for voting for Dukakis.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.294
(laughing)
Seriously.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.096
Oh, my God.
Uh-huh. Oh, and
he loved my brothers,

18:17.130 --> 18:19.499
and they all would go
fishing and hunting.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.734
And then when he retired,
they were gone.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.436
Nobody helped him.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.772
And there was just me.
Mmm.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.507
So I moved back home,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.776
and I fed him
and I cleaned him

18:29.809 --> 18:32.845
and I wiped his
ass when he shit,
Oof.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.114
until that turned
into changing him.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.617
And he still
didn't talk to me.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.019
I can't believe that.
Yeah.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.021
I wiped my father's ass

18:42.054 --> 18:44.157
while he gave me
the silent treatment.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.626
Wow!
It was awesome.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.995
Yep. And then

18:49.028 --> 18:52.499
he started to get demented.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.602
And the crazy thing was
that when he lost his mind,

18:55.635 --> 18:57.937
he forgot who I was,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.639
and so then he was nice to me.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.475
And we got to
be real pals.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.278
Mmm. Wow.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.014
You've-- like, on a daily basis,
we'd get along great.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.616
And he'd forget all about it

19:09.649 --> 19:11.551
and we'd start again
the next morning.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.553
Oh, my God, honey.
Mm-hmm.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.188
And I liked that.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.657
You know, but it didn't last.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.992
And after a while,
he didn't talk,

19:20.026 --> 19:21.728
and neither did I,

19:21.761 --> 19:23.330
and he stopped
getting out of bed,

19:23.363 --> 19:25.998
and I didn't dress him anymore.

19:26.032 --> 19:30.370
I just kept him hydrated
and clean until he died.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.838
(sighing):
Ooh.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.641
Oh, boy. That's...
Yep.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.744
It's a trip.
Mmm.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.481
The thing is, you get used
to things being hard

19:41.514 --> 19:43.983
where you can work
to make them better,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.852
but this isn't that.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.255
There's no
good end to this.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.022
It doesn't get better.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.558
(sighs)

19:51.591 --> 19:55.228
Your mother is gonna get
worse and worse.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.565
And then she'll be gone.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.236
Yep.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.640
(sighs)

20:25.925 --> 20:27.560
Darling.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.698
Yeah, Mom?

20:31.731 --> 20:35.702
You know that I'm
so proud of you.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.970
You know that, don't you?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.774
Yeah, I know.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.645
And I'm so grateful to you
that you take care of me.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.818
And that you... keep me.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.589
Go to sleep, Mom.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.939
(indistinct conversations)

21:20.713 --> 21:22.114
Are you gonna marry
my mother?

21:22.148 --> 21:24.183
(chuckling):
Uh...

21:24.216 --> 21:26.118
Uh, not today.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.955
Why not? Oh, you don't
love her; I get it.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.826
I'm so tired.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.762
Oh, you are?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.296
Did you have a big day?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.865
No. She didn't
do anything today.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.333
She's just being a butt.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.703
I don't mind.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.341
MAX:
Mom.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.042
Mom.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.978
What? Hi.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.647
I'm here.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.216
So, Max, do you have
any plans after high school?

21:57.249 --> 21:59.652
Mmm. Well, I'm
graduating early,

21:59.686 --> 22:00.987
and then I'm gonna travel.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.789
Like, that's what I want to do.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.057
And, I don't know, I-I might
spend the summer with my dad.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.058
ROBIN:
Oh.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.360
(snorts)

22:07.394 --> 22:09.462
Mom.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.564
Sorry.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.032
FRANKIE:
So I'm sure

22:13.065 --> 22:14.401
you've had sex
with my mother, which is fine.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.702
Oh, my God.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.236
But are you
using protection?

22:17.269 --> 22:19.806
Because if not,
that's fine, too.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.207
I want a baby brother.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.878
(Robin and Sam laughing)

22:28.114 --> 22:30.316
Um...

22:30.349 --> 22:32.018
So, how old's your daughter?

22:32.051 --> 22:34.721
She's 14.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.690
And her mom's not around?

22:37.724 --> 22:40.693
No, not really;
it's just me.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.995
FRANKIE: Wow.
I think that's amazing.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.231
You're raising a girl all by
yourself. That must be hard.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.366
Jesus Christ.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.104
What? Nothing.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.374
Mom, how come Nan's not here?

22:56.409 --> 22:58.878
(sighs)

22:58.911 --> 23:01.414
She's just not, baby.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.249
Here, put some rice
in your soup.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.284
Eat some dinner.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.394
SAM: Hi.
MARION (on phone): Hey.

23:15.428 --> 23:18.565
So I did some research,
and I know a guy in L.A.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.633
who's got a few places,
real nice.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.602
It's called "assisted living."

23:22.635 --> 23:24.737
Bro, it's okay.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.706
Well, I want to help.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.408
No. I'm gonna keep her home.

23:29.442 --> 23:32.745
I'm just gonna do it
till I can't do it.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.882
Or till she can't.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.917
I don't think we're there yet.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.251
(car lock beeps)
Honestly.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.387
Oh?
Yeah.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.989
It's okay.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.991
Okay.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.459
Listen,

23:46.493 --> 23:49.562
I know your issues with Mom,
and I get it.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.165
But after she dies, I hope
you come around more often

24:28.668 --> 24:32.338
* Called Adam by his name *

24:32.371 --> 24:35.942
* And he refused to answer *

24:35.975 --> 24:39.879
* Because he's naked
and ashamed *

24:39.912 --> 24:41.648
* Who's that writin'? *

The timing just felt right.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.063
I was like,
"Is this really happening?"

26:04.096 --> 26:06.699
I looked her in the eyes

It's a moment

disfigured in a horrific
Jet Skiing accident.
