- I hate these margaritas. Gotta
go show 'em how to make it.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.000
- Where's the staff?
We need a staff.

42:25.033 --> 42:26.467
- A bunch of drunk
third graders.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.066
- Whoo!

42:28.100 --> 42:29.333
- Do we need
to start complaining?

42:29.367 --> 42:30.700
Because this is
taking forever.

42:30.734 --> 42:32.200
- These guys want
to go to shore.

42:32.233 --> 42:33.400
- They're not set up yet.
- F---.

42:33.433 --> 42:34.600
- Grab it, Bruno!
F---.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.266
- Today was just
a clusterf---.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.467
- Pick up that deck of cards.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.266
Just pick up
that deck of cards.

42:39.300 --> 42:41.333
- Yep, mm-hmm, that's my butt.
That's--nope.

42:41.367 --> 42:43.166
- You are not
allowed to leave.

42:44.567 --> 42:46.300
[indistinct chatter]

42:46.333 --> 42:47.467
- He's a really,
really cool guy.

42:47.467 --> 42:49.066
- Which ones the boatswain?

42:49.100 --> 42:50.667
- You know which one
the boatswain is.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.333
- Let's see the bottom
of your feet, homey.

42:52.333 --> 42:53.533
- You're walking on
our f---ing yacht.

42:53.567 --> 42:55.233
- I take offense
to that.

42:56.734 --> 42:59.433
- Yeah, I am.
- These guys are dicks.

42:59.467 --> 43:02.734
Like brother, like brother.

43:02.767 --> 43:04.633
