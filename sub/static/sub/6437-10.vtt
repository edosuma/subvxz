WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:06.294
We march at nightfall

00:06.465 --> 00:09.798
and, by dawn's light,
see an end to Spartacus.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.960
- Gannicus: The signal.
- Glaber.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.134
Again!

00:20.270 --> 00:21.976
(all yelling)

00:22.147 --> 00:24.524
Spartacus: Fall back!
Into the tunnel!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.398
Move! Move!

00:30.364 --> 00:32.821
The mountain pass! Hurry!

00:32.991 --> 00:33.980
We'll be trapped.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.490
There's no choice.
We must move!

00:35.661 --> 00:37.652
Ashur:
You will let them go free?

00:37.829 --> 00:40.821
No.
We shall kill them all.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.875
(theme music playing )

00:51.969 --> 00:54.460
(thunder rumbling)

01:20.414 --> 01:22.746
- ( shivers )
-(coughs)

01:26.336 --> 01:28.873
Our food quickly follows.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.912
We have stripped the mountain
of what little it had

01:31.091 --> 01:33.002
ever since Glaber
forced us upon it.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.054
A thing that should
not have happened.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.057
You will find a way
to see us from this.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.183
You always do.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.646
As you always find words

01:48.817 --> 01:50.398
to pull me
from darkest thoughts.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.486
A talent I pray
your next woman holds.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.191
Spartacus!

01:59.369 --> 02:02.031
Nemetes and a clutch of fools
have taken afoot.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.194
Towards what purpose?

02:03.373 --> 02:04.533
They attempt
to breach the Romans

02:04.708 --> 02:06.039
at the foot of the path.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.910
(water splashes )

02:19.431 --> 02:21.592
Give word next time.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.803
Be mistaken as enemy.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.387
Glaber summons you.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.679
We only just finished dining
on the most succulent lamb.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.107
There may yet
be few scraps left.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.938
You overstep, slave.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.104
l but place foot
where our praetor commands.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.194
If you do not care
where it falls,

02:40.369 --> 02:43.031
you are free to take issue.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.872
(men yelling)

03:27.374 --> 03:29.490
I do not know your tongue

03:29.668 --> 03:32.159
nor have cause to learn it.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.622
(yells)

03:50.021 --> 03:51.101
Spartacus: Pull back!

03:55.694 --> 03:57.855
Go! Move!

04:08.749 --> 04:11.206
(soldiers shouting cadence)

04:17.340 --> 04:18.500
Gannicus: Spartacus!

04:26.892 --> 04:29.099
Mira!

04:29.269 --> 04:30.554
(men yelling)

04:37.235 --> 04:38.611
( gasps )

04:38.779 --> 04:40.235
(soldiers shouting cadence)

04:41.281 --> 04:43.317
Advance! Hup!

04:46.745 --> 04:47.985
We must go!

04:55.754 --> 04:57.665
(thunder crashing )

04:58.840 --> 05:00.876
Woman: Who is it?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.382
( overlapping chatter)

05:02.552 --> 05:04.258
- Mira.
- Mira!

05:05.263 --> 05:07.424
We must seal her wound. Nasir!

05:07.599 --> 05:09.931
Heat your sword in the fire!
Quickly!

05:12.270 --> 05:13.851
(wind blowing)

05:17.108 --> 05:18.848
Spartacus.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.108
Was it worth it?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.821
Was it worth her life

06:13.999 --> 06:15.660
to make attempt
to save your own?!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.825
(crowd murmuring)

06:18.003 --> 06:19.118
(yells)

06:20.338 --> 06:22.829
Stay your fucking ground.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.505
She is gone from this world
'cause of you!

06:28.680 --> 06:31.763
You were the mad fuck
that led us to our deaths!

06:36.062 --> 06:38.144
At least she claimed hers
as a warrior,

06:38.315 --> 06:40.522
not starving
and robbed of strength,

06:40.692 --> 06:42.478
as the rest of us
are doomed.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.525
You are right.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.068
We will all perish...

06:53.246 --> 06:55.328
( crowd gasping )

06:59.878 --> 07:02.210
...if we do not stand together.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.415
It will make
no fucking difference.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.377
Seize tongue,
and open fucking ears.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.714
The cliffs of Vesuvius
are impassable.

07:11.056 --> 07:15.516
The southern path holds the only
promise of making purchase.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.346
We hold the higher ground

07:17.520 --> 07:20.262
and, with it, advantage
over superior numbers.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.022
Only if Glaber
is foolish enough to attack

07:23.193 --> 07:25.354
before we are too weak
from hunger to fight.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.565
A man is never too weak

07:28.740 --> 07:31.573
or too wounded to fight...

07:32.994 --> 07:37.863
if the cause is greater
than his own life.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.244
Glaber and his army will come.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.258
And when they do...

07:52.180 --> 07:53.761
Vesuvius will be
forever stained

07:53.932 --> 07:56.218
with the blood of vengeance.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.302
(coughing)

08:06.236 --> 08:08.272
He is all that was captured?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.061
Several more lay dead.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.526
A fortunate thing
you are not among them.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.783
Had the Egyptian and |
not been present,

08:14.953 --> 08:17.319
I fear position
would have been overrun.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.283
The gods favor us then...

08:20.959 --> 08:24.622
and turn from those
who would do us harm.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.458
Tell me of Spartacus

08:27.632 --> 08:29.793
and his thoughts
toward coming storm.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.299
(coughs)

08:36.099 --> 08:37.430
Can he form proper words?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.932
He has yet to break them.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.815
A most unpleasant tongue.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.612
Conditions must be dire

09:00.790 --> 09:02.496
to abandon the higher ground

09:02.667 --> 09:04.874
and attempt at such foolish act.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.003
One that did not appear
commanded by Spartacus.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.879
You laid eyes upon the man?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.381
Briefly, as he and his shits

09:11.551 --> 09:13.837
gave opportunities
for others to retreat.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.923
How did he appear?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.678
Deadly.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.303
Yet there was a look about eye,

09:20.477 --> 09:21.808
one found reflected

09:21.978 --> 09:24.310
in wild beast
when pressed to corner.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.518
Such an animal

09:27.692 --> 09:31.856
never greets the afterlife
absent desperate blood.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.774
Vesuvius is not Ceres' horn,
offering endless bounty.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.659
There cannot be much
in way of nourishment

09:40.830 --> 09:42.206
left upon barren peak.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.035
We shall stay our hand
yet a while longer.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.084
And when hunger and despair

09:48.254 --> 09:50.916
are the only taste
upon his lips,

09:51.091 --> 09:53.548
Spartacus shall kneel
before Rome

09:53.718 --> 09:56.175
for the final time.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.258
( horse neighs)

10:13.238 --> 10:15.570
We should not be upon road.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.406
Let us turn back.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.077
No.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.203
I will not sit idle in Capua as
weeks threaten unwelcome months.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.739
All will soon come to an end.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.748
I would see the day hastened

10:27.919 --> 10:31.457
and my child born in a city
befitting the heir of a praetor.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.464
The glorious occasion
is almost upon us.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.090
To risk the journey to Rome--

10:36.261 --> 10:37.876
There is yet time

10:38.054 --> 10:40.386
if my husband is moved
to bring siege against Spartacus

10:40.557 --> 10:42.047
to early conclusion.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.511
The reason we are for Vesuvius.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.435
A fraction of it.

10:49.607 --> 10:53.566
The whole of the truth
encompassing greater need.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.314
Has heart returned
so fiercely in such regard?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.074
Gaius and | share but one now,

11:02.245 --> 11:07.239
his absence leaving chest
but half filled.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.501
To find yourself in the arms
of a husband thought lost...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.789
that's a blessing
beyond measure.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.004
A happiness I would share
with treasured friend.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.968
You will come with me
to Rome.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.632
I will entreat Gaius
towards dowry

11:25.810 --> 11:27.971
in honor of your service...

11:29.480 --> 11:32.768
and you shall again find
comfort in title of wife.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.445
Your husband would not
have me follow with you.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.697
You have been invaluable
to his cause.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.449
He believes another more so.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.449
l have been promised
to Ashur.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.488
Ashur?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.248
My hand and house
in payment

11:51.419 --> 11:53.580
for blood spilled
in your husband's name.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.663
Why have you not told me this?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.083
I would not have such thoughts
weigh mind and body

12:00.261 --> 12:01.762
with your day so close at hand.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.344
I will seize opportunity
at Vesuvius

12:06.517 --> 12:09.509
and attempt
to rid myself of burden.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.859
Reveal intentions...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.319
and see them embraced.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.196
( metal tapping )

12:36.923 --> 12:40.461
We sit here waiting to die,
and he tends to fucking weeds.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.375
He tends to his heart,

12:42.553 --> 12:44.464
as any man should.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.722
There is not enough wood
to build a pyre.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.231
The ground is too hard
to lay her beneath it.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.141
He can only grieve

12:58.319 --> 13:00.435
and bind her in his cloak.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.362
Blessing then...

13:04.617 --> 13:06.073
that we shall all be dead

13:06.244 --> 13:07.905
before she turns overly ripe.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.071
( man coughs)

13:12.250 --> 13:14.741
( overlapping conversations )

13:20.758 --> 13:24.250
Nemetes and his kind
grow ever more restless.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.091
I fear they're not alone.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.759
I cannot lay blame.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.061
Yet our only chance of survival

13:36.232 --> 13:37.847
is to hold fast to sound tactic.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.768
Like attacking the arena
with a handful of men?

13:43.698 --> 13:47.190
loncethoughtyou
reckless fool.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.108
Now | see bold strategy

13:49.287 --> 13:51.448
is the only reason
you are not already dead.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.032
l have been but fortunate

13:53.207 --> 13:57.041
to have seized opportunity
the Romans would consider mad.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.202
There stand none left to us now,

13:59.380 --> 14:00.881
absent wings to fly from cliff.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.971
The day comes when we must
face Glaber and his army

14:10.141 --> 14:12.803
in open battle.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.353
If I am to die,

14:21.527 --> 14:24.143
at least I shall die
among brothers.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.527
( laughs)

14:42.673 --> 14:44.504
We share a bond

14:44.675 --> 14:47.542
forged not upon the sands,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.553
but upon grander stage
of battle,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.133
and when it ends,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.424
as all conflict must,

14:54.602 --> 14:56.843
I will gain
Batiatus' ludus and villa

14:57.021 --> 14:59.137
as reward for loyal service.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.351
It will become
the noble House of Ashur,

15:01.526 --> 15:03.767
where I shall train
the mightiest gladiators

15:03.945 --> 15:06.857
in all the Republic.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.693
I would count you
among my first recruits.

15:09.867 --> 15:14.236
You will become
gods of the arena,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.530
showered in wine and women.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.416
| ask but for your oath,

15:20.586 --> 15:22.702
- pledging--
- Open the gate!

15:31.055 --> 15:32.670
Wait here...

15:34.392 --> 15:37.134
and see
weighted heart lifted.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.065
There's been
no further movement?

15:49.240 --> 15:50.696
We have taught Spartacus
the futility

15:50.867 --> 15:53.153
of attempting breach.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.865
You cannot school rabid dog
not to bare teeth.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.370
||ithyia.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.872
( laughs)

16:06.215 --> 16:07.876
You should not have come.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.426
Yes, I know the rules.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.084
Women are forbidden
in the encampment.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.251
Oh.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.183
My concern is only for you
and the life you carry.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.014
I would not have you travel
in such condition.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.850
l have never felt stronger

16:23.024 --> 16:26.312
and would travel
a greater distance still.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.610
You wish to return to Rome.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.611
With my husband beside me.

16:31.782 --> 16:35.445
The rebels become desperate.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.781
In a few more weeks,
when starvation--

16:37.955 --> 16:39.820
A few more weeks,
and your heir will be born

16:39.999 --> 16:41.739
in a house tainted
with blood and shit.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.667
End Spartacus' life,

16:48.841 --> 16:53.005
and let us return home to ours.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.135
He holds the higher ground.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.389
It cannot be taken yet
without severe loss of men.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.258
Yet...

17:03.439 --> 17:05.600
it can be taken?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.275
Await me in Capua...

17:14.659 --> 17:18.493
and prepare to celebrate
the birth of our child

17:18.663 --> 17:20.995
in the arms of mother Rome.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.873
You truly stand a titan,

17:29.048 --> 17:30.913
threatening the very heavens.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.673
Go,

17:32.843 --> 17:35.585
and know that you
are in my thoughts.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.183
lwould linger
but a moment longer.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.397
What is this?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.564
A warning from the gods.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.197
How did this come to you?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.991
l uncovered it while
cleansing trace of Seppia,

18:07.169 --> 18:08.875
secreted among her things.

18:09.046 --> 18:13.540
My slave Amana recalls seeing it
pressed into Seppia's hands

18:13.718 --> 18:17.131
by the Syrian toad.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.887
That is how she knew
her brother's true fate

18:20.057 --> 18:22.844
and why she moved against you.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.094
But it holds no sense.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.058
Ashur's fortunes
are tethered to my own.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.813
He is a serpent,

18:29.984 --> 18:32.396
forever seeking the heat
of power and position.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.770
When yours
was threatened by Varinius,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.859
is it a wonder

18:38.034 --> 18:40.867
he sought to slither
towards warmer clime?

18:41.037 --> 18:44.404
A venomous creature to the last.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.664
One no longer holding worth.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.919
He is not alone in such regard.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.291
Serpent and oracle
have both served purpose.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.261
You speak of Lucretia?

19:01.432 --> 19:02.592
I speak of a woman

19:02.767 --> 19:05.258
who knows secrets
I would not have revealed.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.725
You would ask me
to do such a thing?

19:12.193 --> 19:16.903
I would put unfortunate
past behind us...

19:19.116 --> 19:22.279
and seize glorious future.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.623
You are my husband...

19:37.760 --> 19:42.003
and |, dutiful wife.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.980
l have missed
your delicate scent...

20:03.619 --> 20:08.784
among other offerings
of more personal nature.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.837
It lifts spirits
to find you close again.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.628
| stay but a moment.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.169
A thing of low importance

20:23.347 --> 20:24.928
when set against the promise

20:25.099 --> 20:29.183
of a lifetime
held in loving embrace.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.185
Do not shed tear when we part.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.851
Know that campaign soon
draws to inevitable close...

20:40.364 --> 20:44.778
and Ashur
to deserving reward.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.373
I long to greet the day.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.353
( gate clanks )

21:14.523 --> 21:16.900
(Ashur chuckles)

21:18.194 --> 21:19.650
Syﬁan.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.572
Do you think me the fool?

21:27.244 --> 21:28.745
Praeto r?

21:38.589 --> 21:39.920
I do not understand.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.591
Do you deny taking it?

21:41.759 --> 21:45.172
I take many things
from the fallen.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.712
I thought I had
your blessing to do so.

21:47.890 --> 21:51.303
And did you also
seek Seppia's blessing...

21:53.229 --> 21:55.971
before she made attempt
on my life?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.684
Seppia?

21:59.610 --> 22:02.067
I've never broken words
with the girl.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.856
l have had my fill
of serpent's tongue.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.784
Wait! Wait.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.787
I do not know what you
have been told,

22:17.962 --> 22:20.078
but I fear you have made
a grave error.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.623
No, I fear
you have made the error

22:23.801 --> 22:27.339
in attempting to maneuver
beyond your station.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.550
Unfortunate end

22:30.724 --> 22:32.885
to profitable association.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.812
Perhaps it best my men and l
quietly take leave,

22:37.982 --> 22:40.644
absent further disagreement.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.651
Oh, I would make better offer.

22:43.821 --> 22:48.781
Land and a thousand denarii
to each of you,

22:48.951 --> 22:52.114
in return for faithful service.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.808
You fucking cunts.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.322
Hold.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.993
You once swore to me,

23:38.167 --> 23:40.874
"Yourwill, my hands."

23:41.045 --> 23:43.661
An oath that has not wavered.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.962
I swear it to you, Praetor.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.878
I would test such vaunted words

23:52.056 --> 23:55.014
and the depths of your loyalty.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.718
Spartacus!

24:33.889 --> 24:35.390
There's movement upon the path.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.217
Take position.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.260
( overlapping chatter)

25:03.085 --> 25:04.370
Ashur.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.506
I come bearing a message
from Glaber.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.758
Speak it.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.637
He has grown weary
of this conflict

25:17.808 --> 25:21.676
and would return home
to see his child born in Rome.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.849
A thing of no interest.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.230
( laughter)

25:29.695 --> 25:32.903
Perhaps the lives
of your people hold more.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.611
He offers terms of surrender.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.494
Lay down your arms,

25:41.665 --> 25:42.996
you'll be allowed to live.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.453
(crowd murmur)

25:47.713 --> 25:49.328
Spartacus: As slaves?

25:49.506 --> 25:51.622
Beneath the heel
of the Republic?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.633
Yes, as slaves.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.088
Yet you will have your lives!

25:59.266 --> 26:00.551
Refuse,

26:00.726 --> 26:03.843
and Glaber has sworn
torturous death upon the cross

26:04.021 --> 26:07.809
for all that survive
the taking of the mountain.

26:11.695 --> 26:16.189
And what of Spartacus' life?

26:16.366 --> 26:19.858
The cost of the bargain.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.699
(crowd murmurs)

26:23.999 --> 26:26.411
l for one do not wish
to die this day...

26:26.585 --> 26:28.541
(crowd murmuring)

26:30.798 --> 26:34.666
...yet if it is
to be fucking so,

26:34.843 --> 26:37.175
I shall do it as a free man!

26:37.346 --> 26:38.381
( cheering )

26:38.555 --> 26:40.716
Woman:
Fuck the Romans!

26:40.891 --> 26:42.506
Man:
No surrender!

26:42.684 --> 26:43.719
Syrian cunt!

26:43.894 --> 26:46.055
( laughter)

26:50.567 --> 26:52.182
You have your answer.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.983
Very well.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.067
I shall deliver it
to waiting ears.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.581
I would not have us
part so quickly.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.966
Glaber awaits.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.925
I must return with a reply.

27:22.099 --> 27:25.512
Your head
would serve equal purpose.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.271
Spartacus?

27:32.442 --> 27:33.943
| find no fault
with his reasoning.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.442
( laughter)

27:45.455 --> 27:48.288
The mighty Crixus,

27:48.458 --> 27:53.293
forever intoning
of the honor of a gladiator.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.454
Where stands such now

27:55.632 --> 27:57.588
in the cutting down
of a defenseless man?

27:59.052 --> 28:00.462
Give him a sword.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.889
Crixus: You once dreamt
of honor upon the sand.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.305
Make this your final arena.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.316
You stand a champion...

28:17.654 --> 28:19.986
and l gravely wounded.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.318
There is yet no honor
in such contest.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.619
To shit with honor.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.037
No!

28:29.208 --> 28:32.041
I will not have you soil name

28:32.211 --> 28:33.872
to gain vengeance in mine.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.035
Naevia.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.829
I shall take it myself.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.624
No one has been
more wronged by Ashur...

28:42.679 --> 28:45.421
and no one has greater claim
on his fucking life.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.432
lwill see him fall...

28:54.274 --> 28:56.185
and with him,

28:56.360 --> 28:59.944
memories that haunt
darkest nights.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.529
See it done.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.377
Are you certain of this?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.547
I am far removed.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.425
Very well.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.846
lf Ashur must die today,

29:36.024 --> 29:37.400
at least he will
see Crixus' bitch

29:37.567 --> 29:39.853
to the afterlife before him.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.740
( overlapping chatter)

29:50.914 --> 29:53.030
Take it off!
Rip his head off!

30:06.888 --> 30:09.925
Delicate flower
has grown thorns.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.426
Get that cunt!

30:14.604 --> 30:17.516
Sharpened by
the Undefeated Gaul.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.191
I fear it will not help.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.107
( laughter)

30:25.282 --> 30:26.613
Yeah!

31:01.193 --> 31:02.478
She fades,

31:02.652 --> 31:05.985
as all beautiful things do.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.464
Naevia!

31:31.306 --> 31:32.807
Naevia: No!

31:35.435 --> 31:37.426
He is mine.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.696
Stay back!

31:52.202 --> 31:56.571
I will have his life
for what he did to me.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.086
Or die in attempt!

32:09.261 --> 32:11.047
Yeah! Come on!

32:22.899 --> 32:25.436
Do you recall this,

32:25.610 --> 32:28.226
my body pressed against yours?

32:29.364 --> 32:31.400
You trembling helpless,

32:31.575 --> 32:33.566
as you tremble now?

32:36.746 --> 32:39.658
(yells)

32:43.295 --> 32:44.375
(yells)

32:46.882 --> 32:50.249
I am far from helpless.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.484
You think
this makes difference?

33:09.654 --> 33:12.031
(coughs)

33:13.742 --> 33:15.448
My death...

33:16.786 --> 33:19.778
will not heal
the scars you bear.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.619
Nor erase memory
of my cock inside of her...

33:28.048 --> 33:29.959
or all those that followed.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.590
( laughs)

33:32.761 --> 33:34.251
( gasps )

33:36.640 --> 33:38.050
No...

33:40.018 --> 33:41.554
it will not.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.313
But it is a fucking start.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.647
(yelling)

34:31.319 --> 34:32.934
You were right.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.445
It is no easy task...

34:37.701 --> 34:39.692
to cleave a man's head
from his shoulders

34:39.869 --> 34:41.200
in a single blow.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.879
Then I will teach you.

34:58.388 --> 34:59.719
Donar! Lydon!

34:59.889 --> 35:03.017
See Ashur's head upon the path
as reply to Glaber.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.766
You send a clear one.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.724
It will be nail and cross
for those who live.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.389
Glaber would have seen
us all to such fate,

35:11.568 --> 35:12.899
regardless of answer carried.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.400
Nemetes: So we are
dead either way.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.233
Pity there are not enough vines
for all our corpses.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.068
Close fucking mouth.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.818
No.

35:22.996 --> 35:24.736
Nemetes is right.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.366
There are not
enough vines for us all.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.214
But perhaps
there's enough for a few.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.591
Your words carry no meaning.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.252
They carry
the weight of the world,

35:40.430 --> 35:42.170
braced by your own advice.

35:44.267 --> 35:48.226
Glaber expects us to defend
the higher ground,

35:48.396 --> 35:50.648
as any reasonable leader would.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.227
Yet perhaps
there is another course,

35:53.401 --> 35:55.266
a bold one,

35:55.445 --> 35:58.061
that the Romans
will never see coming.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.612
And what madness
does the Bringer of Rain

36:06.790 --> 36:07.825
contemplate this time?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.456
That we shall sprout wings

36:10.627 --> 36:12.538
and do the impossible.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.421
Man: Head off.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.583
(thunder crashing )

36:22.889 --> 36:24.390
Praeto r.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.302
They have given reply.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.437
Spartacus makes expected choice.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.938
Tell the men to eat well
and gather sleep.

36:41.116 --> 36:44.779
Dawn's first light,
we take Vesuvius

36:44.953 --> 36:48.946
and the lives of all those
who stand in defiance of Rome.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.704
Soon we shall leave this place,

37:35.879 --> 37:37.210
never to return.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.713
What your friendship
brings me...

37:42.761 --> 37:44.592
there are no words
to express gratitude.

37:44.763 --> 37:48.051
You have returned the favor
many times over.

37:48.224 --> 37:52.137
The debt I owe far exceeds
modest repayment.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.972
You drew me
from the depths of madness.

37:57.150 --> 38:00.233
You gave me strength
and purpose

38:00.403 --> 38:03.110
to live beyond the tragedy
which betided this house.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.237
Such things are of the past.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.036
Let them give you
no further pain.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.825
l have tried to put it from me.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.379
The memory
of all l have lost,

38:21.549 --> 38:23.585
it fills the very air,

38:23.760 --> 38:26.797
choking each breath
with the sting of loss...

38:28.223 --> 38:30.430
and binding my heart
in chains.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.930
You stand upon precipice
of release.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.820
Because of you.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.694
You're my savior, llithyia.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.987
And you mine.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.621
You have given me hope

38:58.795 --> 39:01.411
of a life I thought denied me
when my husband fell.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.838
Know that such a gift

39:04.008 --> 39:06.545
shall be eternally treasured.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.637
( gasps )

39:19.482 --> 39:21.393
The child.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.819
It comes too soon.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.652
This is a sign from the gods.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.111
(gasping )

39:31.286 --> 39:32.822
It must be born
within these walls.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.702
(groaning)

39:34.873 --> 39:36.909
Come.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.495
Let us see their will be done.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.682
We have used every vine
we could gather,

39:56.853 --> 39:58.059
enough for four men.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.720
(thunder crashing )

40:03.359 --> 40:07.022
Agron, Crixus, Gannicus,

40:07.196 --> 40:09.027
I would have you by my side.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.650
Naevia: Crixus.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.911
We will be reunited soon

40:24.088 --> 40:26.374
in this life or the next.

40:41.064 --> 40:44.101
I know fear wells
within your breast,

40:44.275 --> 40:47.563
and it does so
with great cause.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.946
The Romans hold numbers
far outweighing our own,

40:52.116 --> 40:57.531
yet they have revealed
time and again fatal flaw,

40:57.705 --> 41:02.540
that they believe the Roman way
is the only one...

41:03.753 --> 41:05.414
just as they believe

41:05.588 --> 41:08.751
that there is only one way
to leave this mountain.

41:10.093 --> 41:14.712
We shall teach them
that we forge our own paths

41:14.889 --> 41:18.632
and nothing in this world
is impossible

41:18.810 --> 41:22.098
when heart and mind
are put towards it.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.604
( cheering )

41:26.693 --> 41:27.933
Brace rope.

41:35.159 --> 41:38.117
Let us begin a lesson
forever remembered.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.618
(thunderconﬁnues)

41:48.923 --> 41:51.289
Agron: The sound
will mask descent.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.300
The gods bless us
with good fortune.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.722
Free men create their own.

42:00.143 --> 42:01.849
We are all gods this night,

42:02.020 --> 42:05.308
and the Romans
shall feel our wrath.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.314
( cheering )

42:49.484 --> 42:52.191
(thunderconﬁnues)

42:58.534 --> 43:00.195
- ( rock clatters )
- Agron: Fuck.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.873
(grunting)

43:21.724 --> 43:24.466
If we but fought as an army,

43:24.644 --> 43:26.760
like the Romans.

43:28.064 --> 43:30.180
They hold only
advantage of number.

43:39.575 --> 43:42.237
One we shall see evened.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.253
Prepare yourselves.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.799
When signal comes,

43:55.967 --> 43:58.083
death shall quickly follow.

44:01.097 --> 44:02.462
(grunts)

44:04.433 --> 44:05.764
(gurgles)

44:07.603 --> 44:09.389
Spartacus:
We must move quickly,

44:09.564 --> 44:12.226
before deed is discovered.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.119
The hour is late.

44:27.290 --> 44:29.121
Sleep will not come.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.287
All | see when eyes close,

44:32.461 --> 44:34.167
it is the end of Spartacus...

44:35.798 --> 44:37.789
and with him,

44:37.967 --> 44:40.800
reason for being
so long absent from Rome

44:40.970 --> 44:43.211
and more important matters.

44:44.974 --> 44:48.387
You will be victorious
where Varinius failed...

44:49.854 --> 44:52.061
a great advantage
within the Senate.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.267
To be used towards elevation.

44:56.485 --> 44:59.898
One day I shall rise
above all others...

45:01.324 --> 45:03.906
the light of accomplishment
giving warmth

45:04.076 --> 45:06.988
to loving wife
and cherished heir.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.826
Raise alarm.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.491
- Praetor!
- Gather the men to formation!

45:13.669 --> 45:14.658
Awake the men!

45:14.837 --> 45:16.668
Fire!

45:24.472 --> 45:25.837
The signal!

45:26.015 --> 45:28.006
(all yelling)

45:30.228 --> 45:32.469
( Romans yelling )

45:35.650 --> 45:37.641
( neighs )

45:40.404 --> 45:42.065
( screams )

45:42.240 --> 45:43.355
(wails)

45:43.532 --> 45:45.568
Where the fuck is the medicus?!

45:45.743 --> 45:46.903
He had gone to town,

45:47.078 --> 45:48.318
the child
not expected for weeks.

45:48.496 --> 45:51.363
l have sent
the guards to fetch him.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.576
(gasping )

45:53.751 --> 45:55.082
Something is wrong.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.663
lt claws at me,

45:56.837 --> 46:00.250
not wanting to leave womb to be
born in this place. ( wails)

46:00.424 --> 46:03.757
I will find something
to ease the pain.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.259
Do not leave me.

46:05.429 --> 46:09.047
Know that I will return,

46:09.225 --> 46:12.934
and together we will see
this blessing into the world.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.861
Again!

46:26.701 --> 46:29.113
(yelling)

46:33.958 --> 46:35.823
I need help over here!

46:38.296 --> 46:40.503
Relocate ammunition.

46:40.673 --> 46:42.789
Advance on rear position!

46:42.967 --> 46:45.379
Kill anyone
who stands in your path!

46:57.064 --> 46:58.395
Halt!

47:04.405 --> 47:06.987
A glorious death.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.649
( laughs)

47:14.415 --> 47:15.825
Kill them!

47:16.000 --> 47:17.786
(all yelling)

47:27.261 --> 47:28.501
( laughs)

47:28.679 --> 47:31.637
( rebels yelling )

47:55.373 --> 47:57.364
(groaning)

48:02.713 --> 48:04.044
(woman screams )

48:04.215 --> 48:06.080
( objects clatter )

48:08.677 --> 48:10.963
I thought I heard a cry.

48:12.056 --> 48:14.138
(thunder crashing )

48:15.893 --> 48:17.349
What have you done?

48:17.520 --> 48:20.478
What was always intended,

48:20.648 --> 48:24.357
to see curse
upon this house lifted.

48:32.493 --> 48:34.484
(screaming )

48:35.830 --> 48:37.741
Shh.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.631
(gasping )

48:49.802 --> 48:51.838
There.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.681
No one left to come between us.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.613
Fall back.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.368
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

49:20.082 --> 49:22.459
Press advantage,
and see victory ours!

49:32.136 --> 49:33.125
Stop.

49:34.763 --> 49:36.094
Please.

49:36.265 --> 49:39.507
We are friends, are we not?

49:41.061 --> 49:42.722
The very best.

49:42.897 --> 49:45.229
Then why would you do this?

49:45.399 --> 49:49.142
Why would you take my life
and that of my child?

49:50.362 --> 49:51.863
Yourcth?

49:52.865 --> 49:55.151
You are but a vessel

49:55.326 --> 49:57.408
carrying a gift
from the gods

49:57.578 --> 49:59.284
to the House of Batiatus.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.206
Now then...

50:05.669 --> 50:07.921
let us see it unwrapped.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.761
( screams )

50:14.929 --> 50:17.671
(yelling)

50:43.832 --> 50:45.538
I owe you pain.

51:00.182 --> 51:02.218
Oenomaus!

51:30.254 --> 51:31.334
Oenomaus.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.932
We shall greet you

51:49.106 --> 51:53.065
in the afterlife, my brother.

52:10.252 --> 52:11.367
( gate clanks )

52:11.545 --> 52:12.876
Secure the perimeter!

52:13.047 --> 52:14.958
Signal all men
to defend this position

52:15.132 --> 52:17.168
Mark your stations!

52:17.343 --> 52:19.504
Romans, ready!

52:19.678 --> 52:21.179
(yelling)

52:39.406 --> 52:41.897
( baby crying )

52:55.005 --> 52:57.496
Lucretia!

53:45.723 --> 53:47.054
( baby crying )

53:47.224 --> 53:48.885
Hush now, little one.

53:49.893 --> 53:52.100
You are safe now.

53:52.271 --> 53:53.886
You are loved

53:54.064 --> 53:56.897
and shall be forever.

54:53.290 --> 54:54.279
Please.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.040
Quintus always wanted a son.

54:58.128 --> 55:00.335
Because of you...

55:01.799 --> 55:03.335
we shall have one.

55:49.304 --> 55:50.760
No.

55:57.521 --> 55:59.933
(child laughing)

56:11.994 --> 56:16.533
lwill not die

56:16.707 --> 56:21.201
at the hands
of a fucking slave.

56:25.340 --> 56:28.252
lam a free man.

56:40.022 --> 56:43.765
The Roman finally
learns his place before us...

56:51.408 --> 56:53.490
on his knees.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.954
You've won nothing.

57:07.424 --> 57:13.260
Rome will send legions
in my wake,

57:13.430 --> 57:19.096
and one day soon you shall fall
to deserved end.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.932
(gasping )

57:30.113 --> 57:32.525
Perhaps.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.815
Yet it is not this day.

57:41.083 --> 57:43.039
( screams )

58:24.543 --> 58:28.627
Let Rome send their legions.

58:30.007 --> 58:31.247
We will face them

58:31.425 --> 58:34.917
and see all
follow Glaber in death.

58:35.095 --> 58:37.427
- Yeah!
- ( cheering )

58:55.323 --> 58:58.690
Now we will become an army.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.664
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

59:05.834 --> 59:08.371
( cheering )

59:08.545 --> 59:11.503
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

59:11.673 --> 59:13.538
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

59:13.717 --> 59:15.673
Spartacus! Spartacus!

59:15.844 --> 59:19.257
Spartacus! Spartacus!
Spartacus!

59:22.059 --> 59:25.051
(theme music playing )
