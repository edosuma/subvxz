WEBVTT

00:10.944 --> 00:12.746
HELLO, MIA.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.386
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME IN?

00:19.953 --> 00:22.090
IT'S OVER.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.329
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.702
( theme music playing )

00:51.652 --> 00:54.088
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

00:54.188 --> 00:57.191
I REALLY SHOULD'VE
STAYED HOME.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.027
I CALLED IN
SICK AT WORK.
THAT'S A FIRST.

01:00.128 --> 01:03.497
AND-- WHAT DID
YOUR DOCTOR SAY?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.400
I'LL LIVE.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.605
DI-- DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.641
I'M SO TIRED.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.010
I WANT TO GO
BACK TO BED.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.780
I'M NOT UP
FOR A WHOLE SESSION.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.118
WELL, WHY DON'T
WE JUST START

01:24.218 --> 01:27.821
AND THEN WE'LL SEE HOW IT--
HOW IT GOES?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.025
I'D RATHER
STAY HERE FOR NOW.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.662
CAN I GET YOU
A GLASS OF WATER?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.964
MAYBE SOME TEA?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.433
MMM, THAT'S
VERY NICE,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.669
BUT I'M FINE.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.774
THAT'S WHAT YOU KEPT
SAYING LAST WEEK--
"I'M FINE."

01:46.874 --> 01:49.243
( chuckles )

01:57.918 --> 01:59.953
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:00.053 --> 02:02.456
FINE.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.430
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

02:09.530 --> 02:11.098
THERE'S NOT
MUCH TO TELL.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.634
I WENT TO WORK
ON FRIDAY...

02:16.304 --> 02:18.806
STARTED BLEEDING.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.175
I WENT HOME...

02:22.210 --> 02:24.578
AND IT DIDN'T STOP.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.649
END OF STORY.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.686
SO, EMOTIONALLY,

02:32.786 --> 02:34.922
HOW ARE YOU?

02:35.022 --> 02:37.491
( sighs )
I'M KIND OF NUMB.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.694
IT FEELS BETTER
THAT WAY.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.596
I UNDERSTAND.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.367
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
GONNA BE A PARENT

02:46.467 --> 02:50.170
AND NOW I KNOW
I'M NOT.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.341
I'M REALLY SORRY, MIA.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.744
I JUST FELT TRANSFORMED
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

02:58.312 --> 03:02.716
LIKE I HAD
A REAL... PURPOSE.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.219
AND I WAS
A DIFFERENT--

03:05.319 --> 03:07.255
A DIFFERENT ME.

03:07.355 --> 03:10.123
YOU KNOW,
A WOMAN HAS A BABY

03:10.224 --> 03:12.326
AND PEOPLE STOP
ASKING QUESTIONS:

03:12.426 --> 03:14.795
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?"

03:14.895 --> 03:17.965
OR "SHE'S SO AMBITIOUS."

03:19.367 --> 03:22.270
OR "PATHETIC"
OR "STRANGE."

03:22.370 --> 03:25.839
IT'S EASY THEN--
SHE'S A MOTHER.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.710
IT ANSWERS
ALL THE QUESTIONS.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.045
IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT YOU HAD
A LOT OF QUESTIONS

03:32.145 --> 03:34.382
YOURSELF LAST WEEK.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.284
( sighs )
OKAY, MAYBE I MELTED
DOWN A LITTLE,

03:36.384 --> 03:38.519
BUT I STILL WANTED
TO HAVE THE BABY.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.292
THE STUPID THING IS
I CAN SMOKE NOW

03:44.392 --> 03:47.060
- AND I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO.
- HMM.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.797
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE
CHANGED A LITTLE.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.499
MMM, NICE TRY.

03:51.599 --> 03:55.102
YOU KNOW, MIA,
THERE'S OTHER WAYS
TO BE A PARENT

03:55.202 --> 03:58.406
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

03:58.506 --> 04:02.209
YOU MEAN COMPETE
WITH SOME YOUNG
SUBURBAN COUPLE

04:02.310 --> 04:03.977
FOR SOME PREGNANT
TEEN'S BABY?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.680
( sighs )
I CAN'T IMAGINE PICKING

04:06.780 --> 04:09.883
IVY LEAGUE SPERM
OUT OF A CATALOGUE

04:09.983 --> 04:13.020
TO DEFROST
AND SQUIRT.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.222
YOU DON'T WANT
TO ADOPT,

04:15.323 --> 04:17.791
YOU DON'T WANT A DONOR

04:17.891 --> 04:20.694
AND YET YOU'RE SURE
THAT YOU WANTED A BABY.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.997
IT ISN'T JUST
ABOUT BEING A MOTHER,

04:24.097 --> 04:27.368
LIKE YOU SAID LAST WEEK.
YOU ALSO WANTED TO HAVE

04:27.468 --> 04:30.404
THE PERFECT PICTURE.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.440
( sighs )
I KEPT WAITING
TO MEET THE RIGHT GUY

04:32.540 --> 04:35.976
BUT IT--
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.681
OR MORE LIKELY
I PUSHED HIM AWAY.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.520
AND NOW NO MAN
AND NO KID.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.125
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.695
LET'S SWITCH
TO THE WEATHER.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.064
IT WAS A REALLY
COLD WEEKEND,
WASN'T IT?

04:57.164 --> 04:58.999
ACTUALLY, IT WAS

04:59.099 --> 05:00.934
SURPRISINGLY WARM.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.671
DID YOU STAY INSIDE?

05:05.373 --> 05:08.642
HMM. DID YOU
CALL ANYBODY?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.647
YOU COULD'VE CALLED ME.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.883
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE STILL
IN MOURNING

05:15.983 --> 05:18.386
AND YOU WERE AWAY
OVER THE WEEKEND
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

05:18.486 --> 05:20.721
MIA, SOMETHING LIKE THIS

05:20.821 --> 05:24.458
- YOU CALL ME.
- ACTUALLY, I DID
TALK TO SOMEONE.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.794
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

05:26.894 --> 05:28.662
I SPOKE TO MY MOTHER.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.432
OH. WELL,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.934
I'D CERTAINLY LIKE
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.803
( scoffs )

05:35.903 --> 05:38.171
DO YOU THINK WE COULD
TALK ABOUT IT INSIDE?

05:38.271 --> 05:40.073
WHAT IS IT
WITH THERAPISTS?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.110
- YOU HEAR THE WORD "MOTHER"
AND THESE BELLS GO OFF?
- ( chuckles )

05:43.210 --> 05:44.745
PRETTY MUCH.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.548
IT'S-- IT'S PART
OF THE TRAINING.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.152
SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL ME ABOUT
THE CONVERSATION

06:25.252 --> 06:27.555
YOU HAD
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

06:27.655 --> 06:30.223
UM, CARA,
ONE OF MY NIECES,

06:30.323 --> 06:32.259
GAVE A PIANO RECITAL
ON SATURDAY,

06:32.359 --> 06:35.328
AND WHEN MY MOTHER SAW
THAT I WASN'T THERE

06:35.429 --> 06:38.331
SHE CALLED TO SEE
IF I WAS OKAY.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.101
YOUR MOTHER
AND NOT YOUR FATHER?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.736
RIGHT.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.739
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM IN A WHILE.

06:47.107 --> 06:50.243
( sighs )
ANYWAY, MY MOTHER IS
THE QUEEN OF PROTOCOL

06:50.343 --> 06:52.245
AND I HAD MISSED
A FAMILY EVENT.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.181
THIS-- IT WAS
CARA PLAYING CHOPIN,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.149
AND I HAVE BEEN PAYING
FOR HER LESSONS.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.186
I TOLD MY SISTERS THAT
IF ANY OF THE GIRLS WANTED

06:59.286 --> 07:01.154
MUSIC LESSONS
THAT I WOULD TREAT.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.592
I MEAN, WHAT IS
THE MONEY FOR?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.529
I DEFEND SOME PRETTY
QUESTIONABLE DOCTORS--

07:10.664 --> 07:13.366
PRESENT COMPANY EXCLUDED--

07:13.467 --> 07:15.869
AND HOW MANY PAIRS
OF HIGH HEELS DO I NEED?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.605
IS THAT BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

07:17.705 --> 07:19.707
THAT MUSIC ISN'T
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM

07:19.807 --> 07:22.409
IN THE WAY
THAT IT WAS FOR YOU?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.444
PLAYING PIANO WAS

07:24.545 --> 07:27.915
THE ONE THING THAT
ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL HAPPY.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.951
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T
ANSWER THE PHONE,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.486
SO SHE LEFT A MESSAGE.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.522
AND THEN LATER
THAT AFTERNOON

07:34.622 --> 07:37.457
SHE SHOWED UP
AT MY APARTMENT

07:37.558 --> 07:39.860
WITH A PLATTER
OF PIEROGIS.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.596
MAYBE SHE WAS
CONCERNED FOR YOU.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.866
YEAH YEAH.
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
A FIRST TIME, RIGHT?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.601
SO HOW DID IT GO?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.970
I WAS STILL
IN MY PAJAMAS.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.240
SHE TOOK ONE LOOK
AT ME, THE HEATING PAD,

07:53.340 --> 07:55.408
THE TYLENOL, THE TISSUES
IN FRONT OF ME

07:55.509 --> 07:58.946
AND SHE SAID,
"DO YOU HAVE THE FLU?"

08:03.150 --> 08:05.218
AND I SHOOK MY HEAD NO.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.122
I STARTED TO CRY
AND SHE GOT IT.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.662
AND SHE SAID
"MAYBE THAT'S NATURE'S WAY."

08:15.529 --> 08:17.264
I-- I DON'T KNOW WHEN

08:17.364 --> 08:19.332
I LAST CRIED
IN FRONT OF HER

08:19.432 --> 08:23.704
OR WHEN
SHE'S LAST HUGGED ME.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.407
AND THEN SHE HEATED UP
THE FOOD,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.409
SET THE TABLE NICELY,

08:29.509 --> 08:32.179
- POURED US SOME NALEWKA.
- WHAT'S THAT?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.715
IT'S A CHERRY-INFUSED VODKA.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.550
IT'S A TRADITIONAL DRINK.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.452
ANYWAY, SHE TRIED TO MAKE
A CONSOLATION TOAST.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.155
SHE SAID
"TO BETTER DAYS..."

08:43.390 --> 08:45.659
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME

08:45.759 --> 08:47.995
THAT SHE WAS PROUD OF ME.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.296
WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS.

08:49.396 --> 08:53.634
SHE SAID THAT
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT I HAVE--

08:53.734 --> 08:55.969
MY INDEPENDENCE,
MY CAREER,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.971
THIS INTERESTING LIFE
I'M LEADING.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.407
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOME OF THE THINGS

09:00.507 --> 09:02.810
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE
WANTED FOR HERSELF.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.445
WELL, I--
I SNAPPED AT HER.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.547
I SAID, "THAT'S KIND
OF A STRANGE TOAST

09:07.648 --> 09:10.250
CONSIDERING YOU'VE
ALWAYS BLAMED ME

09:10.350 --> 09:12.052
FOR RUINING
YOUR MODELING CAREER."

09:12.152 --> 09:15.756
- DID YOU TELL HER THAT?
- WELL, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT SHE SAID.

09:15.856 --> 09:20.193
SHE SAID THAT
SHE DIDN'T REALLY
HAVE MUCH OF A CAREER.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.730
SHE WASN'T THAT PRETTY

09:22.830 --> 09:24.464
AND THAT SHE NEVER
WOULD HAVE RISEN

09:24.564 --> 09:27.801
ABOVE HER JOB
AS AN UNDERWEAR MODEL,

09:27.901 --> 09:31.705
WHICH IS NOT WHAT
I GREW UP HEARING.

09:31.805 --> 09:36.243
- RIGHT, HER MANTRA.
- HER FALSE MANTRA.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.480
THE SAME LIE
OVER AND OVER

09:40.580 --> 09:42.950
UNTIL EVERYONE ACCEPTS
THAT IT'S TRUE,

09:43.050 --> 09:45.385
ESPECIALLY ME, THE ONE
THAT SHE LOVES TO BLAME.

09:45.485 --> 09:49.356
DID YOU ASK HER
WHY SHE DID THAT?

09:49.456 --> 09:51.659
MY MOTHER SAID
THAT IT WAS...

09:53.226 --> 09:55.362
KIND OF HER COVER STORY...

09:57.831 --> 10:00.768
THAT HAVING ME
DIDN'T RUIN HER LOOKS.

10:00.868 --> 10:04.805
IT DESTROYED HER MIND.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.407
SHE SAID THAT
AFTER I WAS BORN,

10:07.507 --> 10:09.643
SHE LOST IT.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.813
SHE COULDN'T
GET OUT OF BED,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.447
SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO EAT.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.784
SHE SAID SHE STAYED
IN HER ROOM

10:16.884 --> 10:19.352
BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID
THAT IF SHE LEFT IT,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.088
SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF,

10:21.188 --> 10:25.492
AND THAT THERE
WAS SOME SMALL,
SANE PART OF HER

10:25.592 --> 10:29.196
THAT DIDN'T WANT
TO DO THAT TO ME.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.631
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
SOME MOTHERS WHO GET
SO DEPRESSED

10:31.732 --> 10:34.334
THAT THEY LOSE SIGHT
OF EVEN THAT.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.104
OKAY.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.740
SO WHERE WAS YOUR
FATHER DURING ALL OF THIS?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.042
SHE SAID HE JUST MOVED
INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.411
HE DIDN'T TRY TO GET HER
PROFESSIONAL HELP?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.680
ARE YOU KIDDING?
( chuckles )

10:46.780 --> 10:49.482
HE WAS
FIRST GENERATION.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.152
HE WOULD'VE
BEEN MORTIFIED

10:52.252 --> 10:53.821
TO ASK SOMEONE FOR HELP,

10:53.921 --> 10:56.690
TO ADMIT THAT
HIS WIFE WAS CRAZY.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.358
SO HE TOOK CARE OF YOU

10:58.458 --> 11:01.128
- DURING THIS TIME?
- HE DID EVERYTHING.
HE HAD TOO.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.431
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO BREASTFEED.

11:04.531 --> 11:09.269
SO, REALLY,
YOU WEREN'T MOTHERED
FOR OVER A YEAR.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.171
WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF IT--

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
SOMEHOW SHE DID--

11:13.106 --> 11:15.976
SHE SAID SHE HAD
THIS RUSH OF FEELING

11:16.076 --> 11:19.346
AND THAT SHE WANTED
TO BE CLOSE TO ME,

11:19.446 --> 11:24.151
BUT BY THEN
MY DAD AND I WERE
JUST INSEPARABLE--

11:24.251 --> 11:28.889
I THINK THE WORD SHE USED
WAS "IMPENETRABLE"--

11:28.989 --> 11:31.992
THAT MY FATHER HAD
NEVER FORGIVEN HER

11:32.092 --> 11:36.129
AND THAT HE USED
OUR CLOSENESS TO SHOW HER
HOW SHE'D FAILED.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.099
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
SO GUILT-RIDDEN

11:39.199 --> 11:41.068
THAT SHE THOUGHT
SHE DIDN'T DESERVE ME,

11:41.168 --> 11:44.905
AND SO SHE JUST
KEPT AWAY.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.107
THAT'S QUITE
AN ADMISSION.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.777
THAT MUST'VE GIVEN YOU
A LOT TO TAKE IN

11:49.877 --> 11:52.579
ABOUT BOTH YOUR PARENTS.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.181
YEAH, I GUESS.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.716
DO YOU THINK
HER DEPRESSION
MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN

11:56.817 --> 11:58.852
WHY SHE DIDN'T
GET PREGNANT AGAIN
FOR 10 YEARS?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.754
NO, SHE TALKED
ABOUT THAT TOO.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.823
THE TWINS--
THE CHERISHED TWINS--

12:02.923 --> 12:05.826
THEY WERE AN ACCIDENT.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.831
SHE SAID THAT
SHE WAS TERRIFIED

12:10.931 --> 12:13.000
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT
SHE WAS PREGNANT AGAIN

12:13.100 --> 12:16.536
AND THAT
SHE ASKED MY FATHER

12:16.636 --> 12:18.906
TO HIRE A SITTER

12:19.006 --> 12:21.241
SO SOMEONE
WOULD TAKE CARE OF US

12:21.341 --> 12:24.011
IF SHE COULDN'T.

12:24.111 --> 12:28.315
AND ACCORDING TO HER,
HE SAID NO,

12:28.415 --> 12:30.717
THAT HE COULDN'T
AFFORD IT.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.986
AND SHE INSISTED
THAT IT WAS HIS IDEA

12:33.086 --> 12:35.222
TO SEND ME OUT
TO HIS SISTER'S
OUT IN NEW JERSEY.

12:35.322 --> 12:38.425
- AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE HER?
- OF COURSE NOT.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.862
MY FATHER ADORED ME.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.331
SHE ALSO SAID
THAT I WAS WRONG

12:44.431 --> 12:47.000
ABOUT HIM COMING OUT
TO VISIT ME EVERY SUNDAY,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.302
THAT I MUST'VE
MADE THAT UP,

12:49.402 --> 12:53.240
BECAUSE THEY CAME TOGETHER
ONCE A MONTH.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.477
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
- ACTUALLY, MIA, IT IS...

12:57.577 --> 12:59.146
BECAUSE IT'S
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

12:59.246 --> 13:02.049
YOU AIRBRUSHED HER
OUT OF YOUR MEMORIES
OF THAT TIME.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.152
SOMETIMES THE NEED
TO PROTECT ONE PARENT
IS SO STRONG

13:05.252 --> 13:07.587
A CHILD PUTS
ALL THE BLAME
ON THE OTHER.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.490
NO, YOU'RE GETTING
THIS WRONG.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.860
SHE-- SHE IS THE ONE
WHO BLAMED ME.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.394
UNTIL SATURDAY,

13:14.494 --> 13:16.897
WHEN SHE CAME TO YOU
WITH WHAT SOUNDS LIKE

13:16.997 --> 13:20.267
AN UNBURDENING.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.903
I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT
MUST'VE BEEN LIKE
FOR YOU TO HEAR.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.972
IT MADE ME FURIOUS

13:25.072 --> 13:28.375
AND IF I HADN'T BEEN SICK,
I WOULD HAVE THROWN HER OUT.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.911
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS
THAT MADE YOU SO ANGRY?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.246
SHE SPENT
MY WHOLE LIFE TELLING ME

13:33.346 --> 13:37.184
THAT I RUINED HER LIFE,
AND NOW SHE CHANGES HER MIND

13:37.284 --> 13:40.287
WHEN I'M VULNERABLE,
WHEN I'VE CRIED IN HER ARMS.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.322
WELL, MAYBE FEELING
YOU CRY IN HER ARMS

13:42.422 --> 13:44.858
- IS WHAT MADE HER OPEN UP.
- WHAT KIND OF TIMING IS THAT?

13:44.958 --> 13:47.660
- WHAT DOES SHE EXPECT?
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.829
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE EXPECTED?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.399
WHY ARE WE EXAMINING
HER MOTIVES?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.969
I'M-- I'M FUCKING HERE

13:56.069 --> 13:57.570
BECAUSE OF HER
FUCKED-UP MOTIVES.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.240
SHE WANTED ME
TO LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.309
"BLESS ME, MY DAUGHTER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED."

14:02.409 --> 14:05.145
I'M SUPPOSED TO LISTEN
UNTIL SHE'S FINISHED
AND GRANT ABSOLUTION?

14:05.245 --> 14:08.648
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU LOOK HORRIFIED.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.284
WHAT, I'M BACK
TO MONSTER MIA HERE?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.853
NO NO NO NO NO,
I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANGER.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.190
SHE DIDN'T TAKE CARE
OF YOU, SHE LIED, SHE WAS
NEVER THERE FOR YOU,

14:17.290 --> 14:21.294
THEN SUDDENLY
SHE WANTS TO BE CLOSE.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.864
WHY...

14:24.965 --> 14:27.100
DID SHE GIVE UP?

14:27.200 --> 14:31.371
OKAY, SHE WAS SICK
FOR A YEAR,

14:31.471 --> 14:33.006
BUT AFTER THAT...

14:33.106 --> 14:37.244
WHY DIDN'T
SHE FIGHT HARDER
TO BE MY MOTHER?

14:37.344 --> 14:40.313
HOW-- HOW COME
NOBODY STICKS BY ME?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.415
BUT SHE DID SAY
THAT SHE TRIED

14:42.515 --> 14:45.652
BUT THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING IMPENETRABLE

14:45.752 --> 14:48.021
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S
BOND WITH YOU.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.689
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING HER SIDE?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.424
I'M NOT TRYING
TO TAKE HER SIDE.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.260
ALL I'M SUGGESTING

14:53.360 --> 14:56.063
IS IT MAY NOT BE
AS BLACK AND WHITE
AS YOU REMEMBER IT.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.931
IT'S BLACK AND BLACK.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.034
SHE MANIPULATED ME ONE WAY

15:01.134 --> 15:03.203
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE

15:03.303 --> 15:05.872
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO MANIPULATE ME
THE OTHER WAY

15:05.973 --> 15:07.840
- TO GET RID OF HER GUILT.
- THAT MIGHT BE TRUE,

15:07.941 --> 15:09.676
BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE--

15:09.776 --> 15:12.479
PERHAPS IN
HER OWN CLUMSY WAY--

15:12.579 --> 15:15.315
THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS
TRYING TO REACH OUT.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.184
SHE SAW THAT
YOU WERE IN CRISIS,

15:17.284 --> 15:18.952
IN SOME WAY
LIKE HER OWN CRISIS--

15:19.052 --> 15:21.621
THERE YOU WERE IN PAJAMAS,
YOU WERE DEPRESSED,

15:21.721 --> 15:23.390
IT WAS RELATED
TO A PREGNANCY--

15:23.490 --> 15:25.625
AND SHE RECOGNIZED IT
RIGHT AWAY.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.594
SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.530
SO ONCE AGAIN,

15:30.630 --> 15:33.900
I HAD A CHANCE
AT INTIMACY

15:34.001 --> 15:35.902
AND I SCREWED IT UP.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.571
I PUSHED HER AWAY.
IS THAT YOUR POINT?

15:38.671 --> 15:40.507
( sighs )

15:41.741 --> 15:43.610
GOD DAMN IT.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.413
JUST STOP ALL THE THERAPY
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.983
OKAY.
YOUR MOTHER TELLS YOU
ALL THESE THINGS

15:50.083 --> 15:51.985
AND YOU GET ANGRY.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.656
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?
- I FELT BAD FOR HIM.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.492
HIS WIFE GIVES BIRTH,
HE WANTS TO CELEBRATE

15:59.592 --> 16:02.429
AND SHE'S READY
TO JUMP OUT THE WINDOW?

16:02.529 --> 16:06.333
PLUS HE HAS
A CRYING, HUNGRY INFANT
TO TAKE CARE OF.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.036
HE HAS TO BE BOTH
THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER,
SO GOOD FOR HIM.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.703
HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

16:10.803 --> 16:13.240
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
COLLUDED IN THE LIE
THAT SHE TOLD?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.975
YOU JUST SAID IT:
SHE TOLD THE LIE.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.244
BUT HE NEVER
CORRECTED IT.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.379
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS, MIA?

16:20.780 --> 16:24.351
- HE WAS HELPING HER SAVE FACE.
- FOR 43 YEARS?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.453
CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT
HE WAS A GOOD FATHER?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.888
NOBODY IN THERAPY
HAS A GOOD DAD?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.159
A GOOD DAD WHO SHIPPED
A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL
OFF TO NEW JERSEY

16:32.259 --> 16:34.227
RATHER THAN PAY
FOR A BABYSITTER?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.230
THERE HAD TO BE A WAY
TO KEEP YOU AT HOME.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.633
I MEAN, FAMILIES FIND
A WAY OF WORKING THINGS OUT.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.603
WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY LYING
ABOUT ALL THAT TOO.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.474
SHE COULD BE,
BUT LET'S JUST TAKE HER
AT HER WORD FOR A MOMENT.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.110
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO REEVALUATE

16:50.210 --> 16:53.180
WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE
AND WHAT THEY DID.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.284
MAYBE YOUR FATHER
WASN'T THE IDEAL MAN
THAT YOU THOUGHT.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.220
AND MAYBE YOUR MOTHER
WAS ACTUALLY TRYING
TO CONNECT WITH YOU.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.056
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
SHE DECIDES TO
REWRITE HISTORY

17:03.156 --> 17:05.058
AND YOU JUST
GO ALONG WITH IT?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.826
WELL, SOMETIMES
WE FIND IT EASIER

17:06.926 --> 17:11.298
- TO HOLD ON TO THE FICTION.
- IT'S NOT FICTION, PAUL.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.834
I'M TELLING YOU
MY MOTHER WAS NEVER
THERE FOR ME

17:14.934 --> 17:16.703
AND MY FATHER
ALWAYS WAS.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.971
THAT'S YOUR MANTRA, MIA,

17:19.072 --> 17:21.674
AND MAYBE IT'S AS FALSE
AS YOUR MOTHER'S.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.777
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU
DEFEND IT, HOW ANGRY
YOU GET IF I CHALLENGE IT.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.148
I ASK YOU
TO SEE YOUR PARENTS
IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT--

17:28.248 --> 17:30.417
I JUST ASK YOU TO DO THAT--
AND YOU GO ON THE ATTACK.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.520
YOU ACCUSE ME
OF TAKING SIDES.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.189
MAYBE I JUST DON'T
LIKE IT WHEN YOU BLAME HIM
FOR EVERYTHING.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.258
I NEED--
I NEED A BREAK.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.594
( sighs )

17:42.829 --> 17:45.098
SHIT.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.201
- SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.602
( carafe thuds )

17:58.711 --> 18:01.314
IT'S NOT
ABOUT BLAME, MIA.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.917
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.187
I WANT YOU
TO QUESTION THE WAY

18:07.287 --> 18:09.222
THAT YOU HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS

18:09.322 --> 18:12.592
- FOR MOST OF YOUR LIFE.
- OH, IS THAT ALL?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.427
I KNOW IT ISN'T EASY,

18:14.527 --> 18:16.863
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE...

18:18.831 --> 18:22.735
IT'S BETTER TO DO IT
WHEN YOUR PARENTS
ARE STILL ALIVE.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.209
MY WHOLE LIFE
I HAD THIS...

18:30.443 --> 18:34.881
DISTORTED IMAGE
OF WHO MY PARENTS WERE.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.752
AND I-- I DIDN'T WANT
TO LET THAT GO.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.288
I FOUGHT AGAINST IT,

18:41.388 --> 18:43.856
AND THEN FINALLY I DID,

18:43.956 --> 18:46.926
AND IT WAS TOO LATE.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.462
MY FATHER WAS--

18:51.764 --> 18:53.733
HE WAS GONE.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.336
AND THAT WAS

18:57.670 --> 19:00.139
A HUGE LOSS.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.413
I'VE HAD ENOUGH LOSS
THIS WEEK.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.048
I KNOW, BUT, MIA,
IF YOU DON'T GO
THROUGH THIS,

19:09.148 --> 19:11.150
YOU'RE GONNA STAY
WHERE YOU ARE,

19:11.251 --> 19:13.453
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP PUNISHING
THE MEN IN YOUR LIFE

19:13.553 --> 19:16.122
FOR NOT BEING
WHAT YOU NEED--
MEN LIKE BENNETT.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.025
- BENNETT WAS
AN ASSHOLE.
- OR LIKE ME.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.494
YOU BLAMED ME
FOR THE ABORTION,

19:21.594 --> 19:25.064
BUT WASN'T IT YOUR FATHER
WHO ARRANGED IT?

19:25.164 --> 19:26.499
HE WAS
JUST SUPPORTING ME.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.401
OR MAYBE HE WAS,
ONCE AGAIN,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.370
TRYING TO HOLD ON
TOO TIGHT,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.639
TO KEEP YOU
AS HIS LITTLE GIRL.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.841
NO.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.409
NO, THE ABORTION
WAS MY IDEA.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.245
I TOLD YOU THAT
LAST WEEK.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.348
YOU SAID YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HIM LATELY,

19:41.448 --> 19:43.883
EVEN THOUGH HE MUST'VE
KNOWN YOU WERE SICK.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.653
HE WAS-- HE WAS
ALWAYS THERE WHEN
I WAS A GIRL.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.655
WAS HE?

19:50.056 --> 19:52.359
HOW ABOUT YOUR PIANO?

19:52.459 --> 19:56.663
YOU SAID IT WAS
THE ONE THING THAT
ALWAYS MADE YOU HAPPY.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.466
DID YOU MOTHER TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.975
SHE SAID THAT

20:09.075 --> 20:11.478
HE SOLD IT.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.684
HE SAID WITH TWO BABIES
IN THE HOUSE THERE WAS
ENOUGH NOISE.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.820
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING:

20:20.920 --> 20:22.722
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

20:24.123 --> 20:26.359
IF YOU BELIEVED HER?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.796
IF YOU ACTUALLY
LET YOURSELF FEEL

20:29.896 --> 20:32.565
THE HURT
AND THE ANGER THAT

20:32.665 --> 20:35.835
YOU MIGHT HAVE BURIED
FOR THIS PERFECT DAD?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.344
I CAN'T DO THIS, PAUL.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.446
OKAY?
NOT TODAY, NOT THIS WEEK.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.548
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS
THE PERFECT TIME.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.518
THIS IS A WEEK THAT'S
BEEN FILLED WITH LOSS.

20:51.618 --> 20:55.054
YOU MOTHER COMES
AND SHE GIVES YOU...

20:55.154 --> 20:57.123
A NEW FAMILY HISTORY.

20:57.223 --> 21:00.527
THE PICTURE YOU'VE
HAD OF THEM IS JUST
TORN UP AND THROWN AWAY.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.464
AND EARLIER IN THE WEEK
YOU LOST YOUR OWN CHILD,

21:04.564 --> 21:09.168
THE BABY THAT
YOU WANTED FOR SO LONG.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.573
THAT NEW FAMILY
ALSO JUST TAKEN AWAY.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.711
THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE.

21:18.811 --> 21:22.815
ON SATURDAY
MY MOTHER INSISTED
ON CALLING HER DOCTOR,

21:22.915 --> 21:26.218
AND HE HAD US
MEET HIM AT HIS OFFICE
IN GREENPOINT

21:26.319 --> 21:30.590
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.526
HE'S THE SAME DOCTOR
WHO DELIVERED THE TWINS.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.795
HADN'T YOU ALREADY
SEEN YOUR DOCTOR?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.597
I CALLED ON FRIDAY.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.668
MY PARK AVENUE
OBGYN SAID, YOU KNOW,

21:41.768 --> 21:45.705
WAIT IT OUT AND TO CALL HIM
IF THE PAIN GOT MUCH WORSE.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.141
SO MY MOM DROVE US
TO BROOKLYN

21:49.241 --> 21:52.111
AND THERE WAS
OLD DR. SOLOMON,

21:52.211 --> 21:54.714
SITTING BEHIND HIS DESK.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.389
HE DID SOME TESTS

22:02.489 --> 22:05.525
AND HE TOLD ME THAT--

22:07.427 --> 22:09.429
THAT I HADN'T LOST
THE BABY

22:09.529 --> 22:12.665
BECAUSE I WASN'T
EVER PREGNANT.

22:16.403 --> 22:20.507
I TOLD HIM
ABOUT MY F.S.H. LEVEL

22:20.607 --> 22:25.545
AND HE SAID
THAT I PROBABLY NEVER
WOULD BE PREGNANT.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.554
AND THEN HE WENT ON.
HE SAID THAT...

22:35.955 --> 22:38.891
HE SEES THIS KIND
OF THING ONCE A WEEK:

22:40.593 --> 22:43.129
WOMEN LIKE ME--

22:44.030 --> 22:46.365
SUCCESSFUL,

22:47.667 --> 22:50.903
NO CHILDREN,
MY AGE AND OLDER--

22:52.605 --> 22:56.042
WHO COME IN
JUST CONVINCED THAT
THEY'RE PREGNANT.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.450
AND HE HAS
TO TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE--

23:07.454 --> 23:09.656
THEY'RE NOT.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.560
OH.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.564
SO...

23:19.499 --> 23:23.803
SO YOU HADN'T DONE
A TEST BEFORE THAT.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.074
NO.
( chuckles )

23:28.174 --> 23:30.610
- ( sniffles )
- WHY NOT?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.712
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT I WOULD WAIT.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.682
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT
FOR THIS WEEK

23:35.782 --> 23:39.151
TO SEE MY DOCTOR
AND I WAS JUST SO SURE.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.991
BUT I HAD IT WRONG

23:45.091 --> 23:47.093
AND YOU HAVE IT WRONG.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.832
I DON'T HAVE
TO GRIEVE FOR A CHILD
THAT I NEVER HAD.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.603
MIA, LAST WEEK YOU--

23:57.704 --> 23:59.539
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE--

23:59.639 --> 24:01.708
THE NEW LIFE THAT--

24:01.808 --> 24:04.076
THAT YOU FELT
INSIDE YOU.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.146
- IT WASN'T THERE.
- BUT IN A WAY IT WAS.

24:07.246 --> 24:11.050
THE STRENGTH
OF THAT DESIRE

24:11.150 --> 24:13.720
TO CREATE NEW LIFE.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.900
IT'S ALMOST 7:45.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.671
IS IT TOO EARLY
TO GET DRUNK?

24:32.939 --> 24:35.374
WHO KNOWS?
I COULD GET LUCKY

24:35.474 --> 24:38.210
AND MEET ANOTHER
MARRIED MAN AT THE BAR.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.555
I'M GONNA GO.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.292
