00:03.003 --> 00:05.306
Narrator:
Tonight...

00:05.339 --> 00:08.008
Joe: Cooking alongside you,
Aarón Sánchez.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.244
- Yes!
- Whoo!

00:10.278 --> 00:12.980
- ...a MasterChef...
- This is like Christmas, baby.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.383
- ...brings gifts...
- Oh, my gosh!

00:15.416 --> 00:17.051
- ...from the Bayou.
- Shanika: This...

00:17.085 --> 00:18.819
- ( squeals )
- ...sucks.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.322
And when big Cajun flavors
turn up the heat...

00:21.355 --> 00:22.856
I got a live one.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.260
Cooking next to Aarón is
absolutely terrifying.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.262
- ...the top 17...
- Look at me.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.931
...face the shock
of the season.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.967
- There's more on the line
than you thought.
- Oh, Lord.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.249
- Hey!
- Yes!

00:48.282 --> 00:50.718
- Yeah!
- Welcome back.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.187
Top 17, baby!

00:53.221 --> 00:55.523
I'm very excited
right now to still be here
in the MasterChef kitchen.

00:55.556 --> 00:59.560
The judges have given aprons
to all of us for a reason,

00:59.593 --> 01:00.961
and I'm gonna do what I can

01:00.994 --> 01:02.696
to make sure that I get
to that finale

01:02.730 --> 01:04.965
not only for myself,

01:04.998 --> 01:07.368
but I need to make
Joe Bastianich proud.

01:07.401 --> 01:12.240
And now it's time for your next
big mystery box challenge.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.447
Tonight's mystery box has been
curated by a chef

01:19.480 --> 01:20.948
that really knows a thing or two

01:20.981 --> 01:25.286
about great American
regional dishes.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.188
Who is it, Aarón?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.659
- It's me.
- Yes!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.132
All right, guys,
on the count of three

01:38.166 --> 01:40.401
we're gonna lift those boxes.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.004
One, two, three.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.406
- Oh!
- ( screams )

01:45.439 --> 01:48.142
- Oh!
- They are alive.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.977
( whispers )
Oh, wow!

01:50.010 --> 01:52.180
Aarón:
In front of you, you have
live crawfish, oysters,

01:52.213 --> 01:56.517
catfish, shrimp, and of course,
one of my favorites, redfish,

01:56.550 --> 02:00.087
a bounty of delicious morsels
from my backyard.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.256
Matt: I don't really recognize
these ingredients.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.292
I know what they are,

02:04.325 --> 02:06.960
but in Iowa we don't get
fresh ingredients like
this very often.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.962
I'm a little worried at this
point that I'm not gonna know

02:08.996 --> 02:10.631
- what to do with this.
- Right, listen carefully.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.001
Your challenge tonight:
make a delicious dish

02:14.034 --> 02:15.836
featuring at least two items

02:15.869 --> 02:19.773
from that incredible oasis
of magical product.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.444
You also have an amazing pantry
in the equipment room,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.780
but what's in that net needs
to be the star of that dish.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.950
Now, tonight,
you're not only cooking

02:29.983 --> 02:32.320
with some of the best seafood
in all the country,

02:32.353 --> 02:35.489
you're also cooking with one
of the best chefs in America

02:35.523 --> 02:37.225
right alongside you.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.661
- Whoo!
- Yes.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.297
Chef Aarón Sánchez.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.999
This is like Christmas, baby.
Look at that.

02:46.033 --> 02:50.671
You have 60 minutes to make us
one spectacular dish.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.840
- Is everybody ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.008
Your 60 minutes starts...

02:56.744 --> 02:58.646
...now.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.680
Whoa!

03:01.081 --> 03:02.750
Need some mushroom.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.885
- Carrots.
- Aarón: Behind you, kiddos.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.020
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, these are perfect!

03:07.054 --> 03:08.522
Samantha:
Coming from Iowa,

03:08.556 --> 03:10.023
I'm not familiar
with the crawfish,

03:10.057 --> 03:11.992
but they look
like little lobsters,

03:12.025 --> 03:14.228
so I'm just gonna treat 'em
like little lobsters.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.930
Is there pepper?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.599
So I'm gonna make shrimp
and crawfish ravioli

03:18.632 --> 03:20.067
with a tomato basil marinara,

03:20.100 --> 03:21.869
and I'm hoping
that I can elevate that

03:21.902 --> 03:24.037
to the next level
and really wow the judges.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.511
I'm going to be doing
a crispy pan-seared redfish

03:30.544 --> 03:33.213
with fingerling potatoes
and pancetta.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.349
Chef Aarón,
he's right here, you know.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.017
I'm just so happy

03:37.050 --> 03:38.452
that I have the opportunity
to cook alongside him.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.289
Come on, guys!
Keep hustlin'.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.123
I'm gonna try to recreate
a seafood boil

03:43.156 --> 03:45.192
that we have down in the South.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.862
I'm gonna attempt to make
shrimp and crawfish dumplings.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.031
It's a risk, but if you're gonna
stay in this competition

03:51.064 --> 03:53.066
you gotta take risks.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.304
What an amazing lucky bag,

03:56.337 --> 03:58.539
a bag full of fresh shellfish,
fresh fish.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.874
Oh! I got a live one.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.476
- Joe: Oysters...
- There you go.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.211
- catfish, redfish...
- Come on!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.646
- Oh, sorry.
- crawfish...

04:05.679 --> 04:07.481
- Beautiful crawfish.
- ...and shrimp.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.418
Joe: Let's talk about crawfish.
What are the ups and downs?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.919
So, they take literally
30 seconds to cook,

04:11.952 --> 04:14.555
- so they're easy to overcook.
- Yes!

04:14.588 --> 04:16.890
- Let's talk about redfish.
- The skin is a difficult one.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.059
- Very tough skin.
- Come on, Chelsea.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.729
- Joe: So, they gotta be able
to fillet, de-scale.
- Gordon: Yep.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.831
- Gordon: Pinbone.
- Joe: To pinbone it.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.899
- That is a very
complicated thing.
- It's a tough one.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.735
And shrimp, obviously the most
commonly-known ingredient.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.503
Whoo-hoo!

04:29.537 --> 04:31.572
- I'm back at it, baby.
- Aarón is super focused.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.407
He seems like
he's having real fun.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.276
How exciting and inspirational
for all our contestants tonight

04:36.310 --> 04:39.246
to cook in amongst him
and use the ingredients

04:39.279 --> 04:41.615
- from his backyard.
- Right.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.250
- You know what
you're making, Aarón?
- Yep.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.753
Making some étouffée, baby.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.921
I'm gonna make a fish stew

04:47.955 --> 04:50.624
with a nice fillet of whitefish
and some shrimp.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.760
I'm Italian.
We cook with fish all the time.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.261
It's not a big deal for me.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.464
- Aarón.
- Yes, sir.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.099
This smells incredible.
Seriously. What are you cooking?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.034
So, I'm gonna make a crawfish
and shrimp étouffée.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.037
This needs to cook down, Joe,
so, give it a second.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.173
- Aarón. Give me an S.
- Yes?

05:06.206 --> 05:08.509
- Really? I'm not even
messing with you.
- Oh, my God.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.111
- We can help you here
a little bit.
- Really? There you go.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.347
Joe, if this goes south, bro,
it's your ass.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.715
- It's fine. It's fine.
- All right, that's all
I'm saying.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.784
That is delicious.
Utilizing the head,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.852
the tails, the broth,
the seasoning.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.888
- That has a ton
of flavor in it.
- That is amazing.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.390
It'd be nice if you work
a little bit tidy.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.693
How about that?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.495
- Come on. Good luck.
- Come on, leave him alone.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.298
- Taylor.
- Yes, Chef.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.566
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.868
I'm making a fresh
homemade pasta.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.737
- And what kind of protein
are you using?
- I'm using the shrimp,

05:36.770 --> 05:39.239
the beautiful shrimp
and I'm using the redfish,

05:39.272 --> 05:41.074
because this is something
that I cook at home

05:41.108 --> 05:43.577
with my mom and my stepdad.
I love pasta and shrimp.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.245
- Taylor, the heat is on.
- Yes, Chef.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.914
I gave you that apron.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.982
I believed in you weeks ago,
I still believe in you.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.250
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.421
- Fresh herbs.
- All right, Gerron.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.255
- Yes, Chef. What's up?
- What's going on?
You got a lot of action here.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.024
- Tell me what the dish is.
- I do. I got a lot of action.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.692
I'm doing
a pan-seared redfish,

05:58.726 --> 06:01.161
but I'm also going to do
scalloped potatoes with shrimp.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.432
You're putting cooked shrimp in
with raw potatoes into the oven.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.933
- I hope it comes out all right.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.668
All right, Gerron,
you're wearing my pin.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.370
- Don't let me down.
- Execution, baby. I got you.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.342
Less than 25 minutes to go,
guys. Come on.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.411
One stunning portion.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.513
- Right. Matthew.
- Yes.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.515
You're here
because Joe believes in you.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.517
- Yes.
- Tell me, what's the dish?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.753
I'm gonna do
a pan-seared redfish,

06:25.786 --> 06:26.887
and then I'm also gonna
do some fried oysters
with the braised leeks.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.889
But there's nothing cooked.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.258
Yeah, I'm cooking it right now.
That's what I'm getting on to.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.093
- But there's nothing cooked.
Raw, raw, raw, raw.
- Getting the fish--

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
I have oysters in the fryer
right now.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.963
So we're frying
a freaking oyster.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.097
- Frying an oyster, yeah.
- Just look at me.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.099
Look. Oysters take 30 seconds.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.034
- Yes.
- You're cooking the fish last.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.303
- What are you doing?
- I'm going right now.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.805
- I'm a little bit behind and--
- You see. I-- I--

06:44.838 --> 06:46.540
Just spin around for me.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.308
'Cause I was hoping
you'd turn into Superman.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.543
- Yeah.
- And it's not happening.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.278
- Clark, look.
- Yes, Chef.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.213
Spin around again
then come back to me
as a talented cook.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.482
- Yes. I'm going, Chef.
- Wake up.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.717
- Let's go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.452
Chelsea from Houston.
What are you making there?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.621
I'm doing a corn cake
and then I've got shrimp

07:00.654 --> 07:03.290
and fish
with an ancho chili sauce.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.558
You're wearing
Aarón's apron, too.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.793
You looking out
for any tips?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.895
I mean, he's so organized,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.763
and to see him do it
right there, it's unbelievable.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.765
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you, Joe.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.401
Gordon:
Guys, we're down
to eight minutes remaining.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.136
Some amazing dishes out there,

07:16.169 --> 07:17.304
but a lot of them
aren't sticking

07:17.337 --> 07:18.939
to the roots of that bag.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.340
They're coming up
with some ridiculous ideas.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.075
So, Julia,
she's taking the redfish,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.111
she's finishing,
she's cooking in butter,

07:24.144 --> 07:26.413
and she's using
a creamed polenta cake as well,
at the same time.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.481
So she's playing
to her strengths,

07:27.515 --> 07:29.416
but trying
to modernize it,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.284
but totally doesn't understand
the sort of New Orleans style.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.087
Joe: Gerron's doing kind of
like an au gratin potato

07:34.121 --> 07:35.422
with shrimp inside of it.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
Gerron:
Something's not 100%.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.458
Joe:
But he had cooked the shrimp

07:38.492 --> 07:40.093
and then put it in
with the raw potatoes.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.095
- Unbelievable.
- ( groans )

07:42.129 --> 07:45.465
Matt's doing this sort of
seafood sauté dish.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.967
I think he's
a little bit frazzled.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.435
Joe:
Are they taking
too many risks?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.837
I don't think
they're focused enough.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.272
90 seconds remaining.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.474
( whistles )
Good. Beautiful.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.610
One stunning portion.
Let's go, guys.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.445
That's hot.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.848
I'm really excited
to taste a bite of New Orleans.

08:00.881 --> 08:05.519
Gordon:
60 seconds to go.
Please, start plating.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.522
Joe:
Is Ryan gonna present
the whole fish?

08:08.556 --> 08:10.023
That's so unorthodox
for "MasterChef."

08:10.057 --> 08:11.324
Gordon:
30 seconds to go.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.826
Joe:
Let's go, guys, come on.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.394
Aarón Sánchez,
you done?

08:14.427 --> 08:16.129
- Aarón: Yes, sir.
- Gordon: Let's go, guys.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.298
This is it.
This is where it counts.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.035
- 10...
- Both: Nine, eight, seven...

08:22.069 --> 08:24.872
six, five, four,

08:24.905 --> 08:27.808
three, two, one.
And, stop.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.176
Gordon:
Hands in the air.
Well done.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.178
Joe:
Good job, guys.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.246
Oh, my God.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.415
Okay, attention, everyone.
Look at me for one minute.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.885
I have a super important
announcement.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.054
This wasn't a regular
mystery box challenge.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.825
There's more on the line
with this mystery box
than you thought.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.362
Tonight, the cook
that made the worst dish

08:49.396 --> 08:50.530
will be going home.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.199
- Oh, God.
- Just like that.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.967
Nowhere to hide.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.240
Tonight, there's more
on the line

09:00.273 --> 09:03.844
with this mystery box
than you thought.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.880
The cook that made
the worst dish

09:06.914 --> 09:09.049
- will be going home.
- Oh, God.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.451
Joe: Just like that.
Nowhere to hide.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.888
This makes me question
every decision I had made
up to this point.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.057
I have never made
this dish before.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.960
Why did I take
a risk on a new dish

09:19.993 --> 09:23.063
when this could be the dish
that sends me home?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.932
Right, let's start off
with the man

09:24.965 --> 09:28.035
that puts big flavors
at the heart of all his dishes.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.470
Aarón Sánchez,
please bring your dish up.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.539
Whoo!

09:32.572 --> 09:36.109
Holy crap,
my mentor, Chef Aarón,
is incredible.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.079
- His dish looks beautiful.
- What is the dish?

09:39.112 --> 09:41.915
Aarón:
I made a shrimp
and crawfish étouffée.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.117
Made a beautiful roux,
nice and dark,

09:44.151 --> 09:46.286
and I cooked it down
with our trinity,

09:46.319 --> 09:48.221
which is bell peppers,
celery, and onion,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.323
and then folded in some
beautiful crawfish at the end.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.092
Gordon:
It smells incredible.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.727
Julia:
He's got this great technique,

09:53.761 --> 09:55.462
and so many big,
bold flavors.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.430
Gordon:
The depth of flavor,
it feels like

09:57.464 --> 09:58.966
you've been cooking
for three hours. Amazing job.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.400
- Thank you very much.
- Delicious.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.402
It's unreal
how creative he is,

10:02.435 --> 10:05.839
and to have cooked
with Chef Aarón,
it's unbelievable.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.675
The amazing Aarón Sánchez,
come on.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.110
( applause )

10:10.143 --> 10:12.279
Now, as you know,
we've had a chance

10:12.312 --> 10:15.916
to watch and taste
everything you are doing.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.351
And we want to take
a much closer look

10:18.385 --> 10:22.790
at three dishes
that completely
missed the mark.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.624
Joe:
The first dish
we want to examine

10:24.658 --> 10:28.295
is the dish
that featured pasta,

10:28.328 --> 10:30.097
but not in a good way.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.365
- Taylor.
- ( sighs deeply )

10:34.201 --> 10:36.937
Taylor:
I feel like I keep
disappointing my mentor.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.372
And now a dish that I make
at home all the time

10:39.406 --> 10:40.874
could be sending me home.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.445
Okay, Taylor,
can you explain
the dish to me?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.015
Taylor:
I have a spicy
garlic tomato sauce

10:48.048 --> 10:50.550
with a fresh fettuccini,
spiced shrimp,

10:50.583 --> 10:53.053
and a fillet of redfish.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.856
Did you just cook
the tomatoes with olive oil?

10:55.889 --> 10:58.692
No, I was really
trying to focus

10:58.726 --> 11:01.194
on what I really
love to cook at home,

11:01.228 --> 11:03.831
and I always love
to make tomato sauces.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.833
That's not a tomato sauce.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.534
That's more like
a soup of some sort,

11:07.567 --> 11:09.469
- as far as I'm concerned.
- Okay.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.471
The shrimps
are a separate dish.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.673
They have nothing
to do with the concept
of the pasta dish.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.043
The pasta itself is okay.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.312
But I don't know what
this piece of seared fish on top

11:19.346 --> 11:21.548
has to do
with anything else.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.217
It shows me a cook
who's maybe trying to avoid

11:24.251 --> 11:25.719
dealing with fish,

11:25.753 --> 11:28.421
which was the point
of today's mystery box.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.225
Gordon:
How'd you cook the fish?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.395
Uh, I pan-seared it, Chef.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.831
You're here because
I believed in you,

11:37.865 --> 11:39.432
but you missed the mark.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.905
Fish cooked okay,
but I'm concerned,
Taylor,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.573
that you're buckling
under the pressure.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.281
Aarón:
The next dish that we
want to examine further

11:54.314 --> 11:58.085
featured shrimp
and totally failed

11:58.118 --> 12:01.421
on multiple levels
to showcase it.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.090
That home cook is...

12:03.123 --> 12:04.758
Gerron.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
Gerron:
I do not want
to let Joe down,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.361
but I messed up.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.931
So I'm hoping that there
are some good qualities

12:10.964 --> 12:13.700
of my dish
to keep me here.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.937
All right, so,
Gerron, explain to me
the dish, please.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.272
Gerron:
Today you have
a pan-seared redfish

12:19.306 --> 12:21.708
with a shrimp
and au gratin potato,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.777
with sugar snap peas
and carrots

12:23.811 --> 12:25.445
and then a white wine sauce.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.448
Error number one:
that's the intestinal tract

12:28.481 --> 12:31.985
where the shrimp
actually processes
everything it eats.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.455
I'm not gonna eat that
'cause that's disgusting.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.391
So, Louisville, Kentucky,
do you cook seafood?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.393
I don't use
the fresh ingredients

12:40.427 --> 12:43.063
'cause it's hard to get
in Louisville, Kentucky.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.499
You made a huge error
by serving the fish
skin side down.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.437
You have this flabby,
flaccid skin.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.973
But you over-peppered
them as well.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.675
No bueno.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.977
Gordon: Gerron,
where'd you get the idea

12:57.010 --> 12:58.678
of the potatoes
and the shrimp?

12:58.711 --> 13:01.314
That was something
that just popped
into my mind, actually.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.451
- I mean...
- Well, pop it
out of your mind.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.287
Au gratin potato
needs to overcook
to taste good.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.124
Putting shrimp in the middle
of the potatoes to overcook it,

13:11.158 --> 13:12.592
all of a sudden,
you've got a freaking

13:12.625 --> 13:14.794
golf ball in your mouth
from the shrimp.

13:14.828 --> 13:18.498
And there you are
with a bag of goodies
and you give me this.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.471
And the third and final dish

13:24.504 --> 13:27.140
that, sadly,
missed the mark tonight

13:27.174 --> 13:31.611
belongs to a person
that has a lot of great ideas,

13:31.644 --> 13:34.714
but sometimes fails
in execution.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.783
Please bring
up your dish...

13:36.816 --> 13:38.418
Matt.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.056
Matt:
I might be able to be saved
because of my strong plating

13:43.090 --> 13:45.225
and my different techniques
that I use on the dish.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.160
So, hopefully this is
enough for the judges

13:47.194 --> 13:48.896
because I am not ready
to go back to Iowa.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.866
Matt, description
of the dish, please.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.036
Matt:
It's a pan-seared redfish
with some fried oysters

13:56.069 --> 13:58.238
some braised leeks,
carrot puree,

13:58.271 --> 13:59.506
roasted cauliflower,

13:59.539 --> 14:02.575
and a orange
fennel reduction.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.379
Here's the deal.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.715
You would've had
something very appealing
with that fish

14:08.748 --> 14:10.884
had you not put
the fried oysters on top,

14:10.918 --> 14:13.586
'cause it rendered
that skin extremely flabby.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.556
The puree is probably
the shining star of this dish,

14:16.589 --> 14:18.391
but, unfortunately,
your choices,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.928
it's what's having
this dish fall short.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.902
Matt,
here's the problem.

14:28.936 --> 14:32.705
A dish, at this point
in "MasterChef,"
has to have an idea.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.541
Like, what's the idea
of this dish?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.409
You haven't explained--
sell it to me now.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.246
I wanted to try
to bring that leek
and that fennel flavor in,

14:39.279 --> 14:40.580
and, you know,
the fennel flavor

14:40.613 --> 14:41.848
didn't really
come through in the sauce.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.283
You want to play,
you can play,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.218
but you need to do it
with intelligence.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.619
Yes, Chef.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.289
Braised leeks,
which are fine,

14:49.322 --> 14:52.125
that's not enough
to win "MasterChef."

14:52.159 --> 14:54.127
Sorry, Matt.
I'm disappointed.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.266
Matt:
I'm a little bit
concerned right now.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.900
Frustrating.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.769
You gotta step up when we give
you those treasures.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.905
Sorry, Joe. Looks like you're
about to lose another home cook.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.808
But compared to Taylor's dish
and Gerron's dish,

15:08.841 --> 15:10.777
I have a little bit
more flair on my plate

15:10.810 --> 15:13.080
and I think I have
a little bit more
potential there.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.049
Your three dishes this evening
were way off,

15:16.083 --> 15:20.187
but the reality is
that only one home cook
is going home this evening.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.192
Taylor,
please step forward.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.631
- You are spared,
but never put a dish like that
- Oh, thank God.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.500
in front of us again.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.968
Please go to your station.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.337
Thank you, Chefs.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.339
Gordon,
if you don't mind,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.641
I think this decision
should be rendered by Joe.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.476
Yep.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.346
Gerron, Matt,
I gave you both aprons

15:46.379 --> 15:48.315
because I believed
in both of you.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.319
Only one of you
will survive.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.487
With a heavy heart,
I have to say

15:54.521 --> 15:58.558
the person
leaving tonight is...

16:04.497 --> 16:07.334
The person
leaving tonight...

16:11.171 --> 16:14.241
with a heavy heart,
I have to say is...

16:19.012 --> 16:21.314
Matt.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.317
Gerron, please.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.154
Return to your station, Gerron.
Get your head in this game.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.656
Thank you, Chef.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.991
Matt, you're a smart guy.
Tonight you missed it.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.127
I just want to thank you,
judges, thank "MasterChef."

16:34.161 --> 16:35.495
You know, I've only been
cooking two years,

16:35.528 --> 16:36.996
so there's a lot to learn,
still,

16:37.030 --> 16:38.465
and this has been
an incredible journey.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.333
Two years is not
a long time to be cooking,

16:40.367 --> 16:42.069
and if you're cooking
at this level in two years,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.671
there's a lot more great food
gonna come from you.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.173
Thank you, Chef.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.341
Matt, please put your apron
at your station

16:48.375 --> 16:49.742
and leave
the MasterChef kitchen.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.910
- Thank you, guys.
- Good night.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.245
Good night.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.181
Okay, Matt.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.882
Matt:
Only cooking for two years
and to make it

16:55.915 --> 16:57.750
into the top 17
of "MasterChef,"

16:57.784 --> 16:59.186
I think I'm really
proud of it.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.920
I think it should also
be a message

17:00.953 --> 17:03.090
to the people out there
that are just starting to cook.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.924
If you're truly passionate,
follow your passions.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.526
Bye.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.795
You're a great guy.

17:12.899 --> 17:17.904
Right, all of you, let that exit
be a stern reminder,

17:17.937 --> 17:21.108
every time you cook in this
kitchen, you bring your A game.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.709
Let's get back
to some good news.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
Right now,
Joe, Aarón, and myself

17:24.777 --> 17:27.280
are gonna choose
two dishes each.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.883
These six do not
have to compete tonight

17:30.917 --> 17:33.953
in a very tough
pressure test.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.789
I'm very pleased
with the performance
of two of my mentees...

17:38.591 --> 17:40.560
...in particular,
for their drive

17:40.593 --> 17:43.230
and their understanding
of the ingredients.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.964
Congratulations...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.303
Bryan and Cesar.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.773
You are safe
from the elimination test.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.275
So, there are two
of my mentees

17:55.308 --> 17:57.744
that I'm also equally
proud of tonight.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.978
You got the theme,

17:59.011 --> 18:00.913
you delivered
big, bold flavors

18:00.947 --> 18:03.450
very, very
satisfying to eat.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.718
Congratulations to...

18:05.752 --> 18:08.455
Ralph and Mark.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.457
Let's go, Mark.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.126
The top two
for me tonight,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.628
the dishes were amazing.

18:15.662 --> 18:20.433
Samantha and Bowen.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.269
Please come up here
and join us.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.405
More of that, young man.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.240
Line up, please.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.675
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.244
Now, the rest of you,
listen carefully.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.814
Many Americans don't have
time, energy, or interest

18:34.847 --> 18:36.849
- to cook every day, right?
- Right.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.418
- Aarón?
- Yeah.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.619
Uh-oh.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.887
Uh-oh.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.825
( all groan )

18:45.858 --> 18:48.328
Frozen dinners.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.831
Now, tonight we have
chosen one of America's

18:51.864 --> 18:54.033
most popular
frozen dinners...

18:55.835 --> 18:58.004
Salisbury steak.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.973
- It's not actually a steak.
- What?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.477
- Mmm.
- ( chuckles )

19:04.511 --> 19:07.180
You have a frozen
Salisbury steak

19:07.214 --> 19:09.316
covered in a mushroom gravy,

19:09.349 --> 19:11.651
served with roasted
red bliss potatoes,

19:11.684 --> 19:14.821
finished
with some green beans...

19:14.854 --> 19:16.155
from 2004.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.527
This iconic American
frozen dinner

19:20.560 --> 19:24.163
takes 45 minutes
to heat up in the oven,

19:24.197 --> 19:27.834
but some of you
will have even less time.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.838
You six will not be cooking,

19:31.871 --> 19:34.341
but your night
is not quite over yet.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.376
Here's the deal, guys.
In the equipment room,

19:36.409 --> 19:39.212
there are 10 boxes
of that Salisbury steak dinner.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.815
Seven of them have 45 minute
cook times on the boxes.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.218
One has 40 minutes
on the box,

19:45.252 --> 19:47.554
one has 35 minutes.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.357
And, yes,
one home cook

19:50.390 --> 19:55.695
will only get 30 minutes
to complete their dish.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.896
Wow!

19:56.929 --> 19:58.831
Inside the equipment room,

19:58.865 --> 20:02.702
on the refrigerator, you'll find
some lovely fridge magnets.

20:02.735 --> 20:06.739
Those magnets contain the faces
of all of these home cooks.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.243
You will take those
and place them on the box.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.178
You're effectively assigning
cook time

20:12.211 --> 20:15.682
to each of these home cooks.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.850
You'll have just
three minutes to decide.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.719
Your time starts now.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.554
- Go, Bowen.
- Go! Go! Go!

20:21.588 --> 20:23.556
- Grab those magnets, Cesar.
- Got 'em, got 'em.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.891
What are y'all thinking?
What are y'all thinking?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.859
Let's go!
Let's go!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.395
All right,
who is for sure 30 minutes?

20:28.428 --> 20:31.063
- I say Shanika 30.
- No, Shanika 40. No. No.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.732
- I'm thinking Emily for 30.
- I think Emily for 30.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.367
- No. 45.
- No. No. No. No.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.436
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I say challenge her with 40.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.738
- No. No. No. No.
- No, 35. 35. 35.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.374
- 35.
- I think Julia 30 minutes
and Shanika 35.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.543
- Why?
- Julia has been baking
really well.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.412
We have not seen Julia
really cook savory.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.780
We have not seen Julia
cook savory.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.549
Why y'all giving Shanika
so much time?

20:49.582 --> 20:52.452
- I know she's good.
- I think Shanika should
have 40.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.654
- Shanika has 40.
- That I can live with.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.590
- That's it right there, guys.
- There we go.
Everyone else has 45 minutes.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.393
We decide to give Shanika
40 minutes,

21:00.427 --> 21:03.930
Emily 35 minutes,
and Julia 30 minutes.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.899
- Time's up. Let's go.
- Go! Go! Go! Get outta here.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.602
We are targeting the people
we feel are the strongest

21:09.636 --> 21:12.305
or that rub the other
contestants the wrong way,

21:12.339 --> 21:15.107
like Shanika.

21:15.141 --> 21:20.347
So, did you all have an input
across those three minutes?

21:20.380 --> 21:23.850
- Yes.
- Just as a stern reminder,

21:23.883 --> 21:27.286
at least one of you
will be eliminated tonight.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.323
Your 45 minutes starts...

21:32.291 --> 21:33.526
...now.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.329
Ralph:
Let's go, guys!

21:36.363 --> 21:38.765
Cesar:
Come on, guys!

21:38.798 --> 21:41.634
Boxes, boxes, boxes,
boxes, boxes.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.036
- 35 minutes.
- 40 minutes.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.308
30? I knew it.
I knew it.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.978
Wouldn't you know it?
I'm the 30 minute girl.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.880
- You're 30?
- Yeah.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.448
- You can't get it yet.
- Oh no, I can't get it yet.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.550
I had a feeling
this was coming,

21:57.584 --> 21:58.985
because there's a lot of people
that are threatened by me.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.720
Man, that's gotta suck.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.155
But I'm not worried about it.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.558
I'm definitely gonna use
this time to strategize

22:05.592 --> 22:07.860
what I'm gonna do
and just get this done.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.135
Come on, y'all.
Get it in.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.237
Shanika, how much time
have they allotted?

22:18.270 --> 22:20.407
- 40 minutes.
- 40 minutes. Wow!

22:20.440 --> 22:22.074
- Julia?
- 30.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.176
- Emily. 35 minutes.
- 35 minutes, Chef.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.679
You ladies got your work
cut out.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.180
Joe: So, if you've been
dealt the five,

22:28.214 --> 22:30.249
the 10 minute,
the 15-minute penalty,

22:30.282 --> 22:32.519
is it make-or-break?
How hard is it?

22:32.552 --> 22:35.855
Salisbury steak is
basically almost like
a fast-track meatloaf

22:35.888 --> 22:37.524
with a beautiful glaze on there.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.492
You need time to do this.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.495
Shanika, 15 seconds, stand by.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.196
This is her time
to step up.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.433
Shanika, 40 minutes.
If she's smart,

22:46.466 --> 22:48.935
she'll take those five minutes
and absolutely categorize

22:48.968 --> 22:51.604
what she needs to do
over the next 40 minutes.

22:51.638 --> 22:56.543
Shanika, three, two, one.
Start.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.111
Everybody up there
on that balcony,

22:59.145 --> 23:02.281
trying to throw me off my game
by taking five minutes
away from me,

23:02.314 --> 23:04.451
but it's just not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna make small pieces

23:04.484 --> 23:06.619
so the Salisbury steak
cooks a lot faster,

23:06.653 --> 23:10.857
get my gravy on, cook my veggies
last, make sure my potato's in.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.391
I got this.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.960
So, my spin
on Salisbury steak today,

23:13.993 --> 23:16.463
I just plan on adding
a little bit of bacon

23:16.496 --> 23:18.465
and a little white cheddar
to elevate that.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.733
I actually cooked Salisbury
steak before.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.301
Where I come from,
it's a poor man's meal.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.636
So, I'm feeling really good

23:23.670 --> 23:25.071
because I've done this before.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.073
Emily, stand by.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.842
Three, two, one.
Start.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.880
35 minutes might seem like a
challenge to a lot of people...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.548
Parsley.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.416
...but I know that I have
the skills and ability

23:37.450 --> 23:39.151
to adjust to any situation
that I'm given.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.888
Having that 10 extra minutes
to kind of game plan

23:41.921 --> 23:43.990
is an advantage to me.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.892
I had time to actually fully
concept my dish.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.760
Emily's wearing my apron,
and the reason

23:47.794 --> 23:49.796
that I picked her primarily
is 'cause she's smart.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.632
I think that her intelligence
will get her through
this challenge.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.166
No problem.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.303
Nice moves, S.J.
Stay focused, Ash.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.672
- Stay focused.
- I have made Salisbury steak
before.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.509
To me, it's kind of
like upscale meatloaf.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.143
Before I came to this
competition, my dad told me

24:04.176 --> 24:07.446
not to overcomplicate everything
and just do the best,

24:07.480 --> 24:09.181
and today I want
the ingredients to shine.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.951
So I'm trying not to
overcomplicate anything today.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.988
- I do like seeing Julia
struggle like this.
- Yeah.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.457
15 seconds, Julia.
Stand by.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.359
So Julia only has
30 minutes.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.495
Like, she could
be screwed.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.463
Half hour is
not enough.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.033
Julia, three, two, one.
Start.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.835
- Go, Julia!
- Let's go, Julia.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.603
Aarón:
Julia has what it takes.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.138
She grew up in a restaurant
family, her family owned diners.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.973
I believe
that she can turn this around

24:34.006 --> 24:35.341
and make something great.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.810
Plantains, potatoes.

24:37.844 --> 24:41.313
Aarón, I feel that Julia's
challenge tonight
is insurmountable.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.015
You will be losing an apron,
my friend.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.283
Gordon:
25 minutes to go, guys.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.218
- Come on.
- Yes.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.887
Get it going, G.
Get it going.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.455
Get it going, bro.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.691
- Right, Emily.
- Yes, Chef.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.526
- You had 10 minutes less
than everybody else.
- Yes, I did.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.227
Tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

24:55.261 --> 24:58.030
I'm doing some crispy diced
potatoes with Salisbury steak,

24:58.064 --> 25:00.533
Hen of the Woods mushroom
cream sauce,

25:00.567 --> 25:02.902
then I've got green beans,
a little bit of lemon zest
and some almond.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.804
You actually enjoy
being under pressure

25:04.837 --> 25:07.139
- more than anybody, don't you?
- I do. I'm a procrastinator

25:07.173 --> 25:08.908
and I wouldn't write a paper
until the night before,

25:08.941 --> 25:10.710
so I work best under pressure.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.579
- Young lady, good luck.
- Thank you.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.480
- I see you, Emily.
- Joe: All right, Shanika.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.083
- You were penalized
by five minutes.
- Yeah.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.085
So talk to me a little bit
about your experience
with Salisbury steak.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.720
I grew up eating it
in Miami.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.755
My mom actually used
to cook it all the time,

25:22.789 --> 25:25.324
but I personally don't cook
Salisbury steaks.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.826
They had three bullets to give,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.761
so they shot one at you.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.763
I need to understand
why they would target you.

25:30.797 --> 25:34.601
I honestly believe they know
that I'm the next MasterChef.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.136
- That's a good answer.
- Keep going, Shanika.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.109
We are down to 20 minutes
remaining.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.778
- You've got to speed up.
- Mushroom, steak. Okay.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.780
Hey, is S.J.
gonna do some cooking?

25:47.814 --> 25:50.016
- Yeah.
- Mark: I don't know what
S.J. is doing.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.252
It's crazy.
What are you doing?

25:53.285 --> 25:56.022
- So, S.J., tell me
what you're doing.
- Yes, Chef?

25:56.055 --> 25:58.257
I'm going to be doing
a Salisbury steak

25:58.290 --> 26:01.027
with a mushroom gravy,
with caramelized shallots,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.129
- mushrooms with--
- Stop.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.231
- Yes, Chef.
- There's nothing cooked.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.800
Yes, it's what I'm doing
right now.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.969
- Get your ( bleep ) together.
- Yes, Chef.

26:10.002 --> 26:13.372
Hey, young man,
and it would help immensely

26:13.405 --> 26:15.975
to turn the ( bleep ) gas on.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.577
My God.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.486
Mushroom, steak. Okay.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.455
- So, S.J.
- Yes, Chef?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.390
- Stop.
- Yes, Chef.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.760
There's nothing cooked.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.428
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, it's what I'm doing
right now.

26:36.462 --> 26:40.232
It would help immensely
to turn the ( bleep ) gas on.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.268
Should've been on.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.270
S.J.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.305
- Yes, Chef. Yes.
- I believed in you.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.775
Focus, rein it in.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.142
- Absolutely.
- Good luck.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.644
Yes, Chef.

26:51.678 --> 26:54.747
- Lindsay.
- How you doing, Chef?

26:54.781 --> 26:56.315
Talk to me a little bit about
your version of Salisbury steak.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.617
Got a lamb and beef
Salisbury steak

26:58.651 --> 27:01.087
with some roasted
fingerling potatoes,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.621
fortified beef stock,

27:02.655 --> 27:05.324
and I put just about every
mushroom in there to use

27:05.357 --> 27:08.160
- as the basis for my gravy.
- That's good flavor.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.663
I'm gonna make a little fresh
green bean salad for the side,

27:10.697 --> 27:13.299
give it a little freshness,
'cause the Salisbury steak
is a little bit heavy.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.434
You're an attorney now,
you work long hours.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.137
A frozen meal is something
that happens in the life
of a busy person.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.772
Before I left and came here,

27:19.806 --> 27:21.440
I froze lasagnas and I froze
soups and everything,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.509
so my wife could eat
while I was away.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.178
- Good luck.
- Gordon: Less than
five minutes remaining.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.681
- Julia. I mean,
seriously, young lady.
- Yes.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.182
- 30 minutes.
- I know.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.851
Tell me
about the shortcuts.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.519
How are you saving
that 15 minutes?

27:33.552 --> 27:34.821
I'm gonna use the same pan
to put the mushrooms in,

27:34.854 --> 27:36.689
make the gravy
in the same pan.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
So you're making all in one.
So you're making the gravy--

27:38.224 --> 27:39.391
so that's a smart move.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.027
They can test me
all they want.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.528
This Italian girl is
not gonna go home tonight

27:42.561 --> 27:45.297
or any other night.
I'm here to win.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.299
Young lady, taste everything
and give us your best shot.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.335
- I will. Thank you.
- Good luck.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.705
Wow!

27:52.739 --> 27:55.708
I mean, first of all,
these smells are incredible.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.476
- Whoo!
- Pretty good, yeah.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.979
Gordon:
We are down to our last minute.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.547
All right.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.716
Aarón:
Bring all your elements
to the plate.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.051
Gerron:
A little bit of salt.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.418
Come on, Gerron.
You gotta plate.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.686
Salt, salt, salt.
Where's my salt?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.055
- There we go.
- Come on, Gerron.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.823
Aarón:
Think about plating, y'all.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.492
Consistency of gravies
and sauces.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.095
Gordon:
Taste everything.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.663
Ralph:
Get it on a plate, guys.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.732
Gordon:
15 seconds remaining.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.233
Ryan:
Come on, get going!
Get going!

28:21.267 --> 28:23.402
- Get it on a plate!
- Mark: Come on, S.J.

28:23.435 --> 28:28.407
Chefs:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

28:28.440 --> 28:33.679
five, four, three, two, one.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.181
And stop.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.116
Hands in the air.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.587
Ralph:
Good job, guys.

28:41.620 --> 28:46.192
Okay, home cooks, you all just
had to make a fresh version

28:46.225 --> 28:49.228
of this Salisbury steak.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.963
Now, at the end of tonight,

28:50.997 --> 28:54.100
at least one of you
will be going home.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.735
Let's see how you did.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.439
Aarón:
First up, a home cook
that has Joe's apron.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.942
Please step forward, Shanika.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.211
Shanika: These people
obviously don't know

29:05.244 --> 29:06.545
what I've been through in life.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.080
Taking five minutes away
from me,

29:08.114 --> 29:10.149
it's just not gonna stop me.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.451
I know that I nailed
this freaking Salisbury steak.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.756
All right, Shanika.
You were deprived

29:17.790 --> 29:19.225
- of five minutes.
- Five minutes.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.895
I mean, guys,
what was your thinking?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.898
I just seem to keep rubbing
people the wrong way.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.801
Might be too outspoken.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.669
Visually, it does
make a statement.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.138
I think the color
arrangement,

29:32.171 --> 29:34.273
the blue potatoes,
the green, the red.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.142
- Describe the dish, please.
- The sauce,

29:36.175 --> 29:38.144
I made it with the beef broth.

29:38.177 --> 29:41.147
I cooked it down with pancetta,
little bit of olive oil.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.949
The beans were blanched
with salt,

29:42.982 --> 29:45.818
and I roasted the potatoes
with some rosemary, thyme,

29:45.852 --> 29:47.253
salt and pepper.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.288
The Salisbury steak
and the gravy,

29:49.321 --> 29:51.523
that right there
is amazing.

29:51.557 --> 29:57.263
But everything else
on that plate is really
rough to get through.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.299
These potatoes are
a real rough proposition,

30:00.332 --> 30:03.102
'cause they're not really fried,
but not really roasted.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.937
They're kinda living
in this limbo.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.474
The green beans are real
mundane and very ordinary.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.776
But let me tell you,
the Salisbury steak's there.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.845
It's seared, it's delicious,
it's earthy,

30:12.879 --> 30:16.048
but everything else is
so rough and so bad.

30:16.082 --> 30:18.284
It almost takes away
from all the magic

30:18.317 --> 30:20.452
that you did
on that damn steak,

30:20.486 --> 30:22.554
and that can literally
be enough to send you home.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.658
The five minutes would've
been welcome for you,

30:26.692 --> 30:29.295
'cause it would've allowed you
to finish these ideas
a little bit better.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.698
- Gotcha. Thank you.
- Thank you.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.135
I am tired of seeing that
disappointment in Joe's eyes,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.704
but although I made
these horrible mistakes,

30:38.737 --> 30:42.041
I cooked that Salisbury steak
properly.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.711
I don't feel like
this is my time to leave.

30:45.744 --> 30:49.581
Next up, the home cook
Joe gave an apron to, Emily.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.917
Emily: I had 10 minutes less
than everyone else

30:50.950 --> 30:52.418
and I'm a little bit nervous.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.520
I know it looks a bit
of a mess,

30:54.553 --> 30:57.924
but I'm just hoping and praying
that my flavors pull through.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.192
If not, then I could be
the one going home.

31:00.226 --> 31:03.695
Emily, the six up
on the balcony

31:03.729 --> 31:05.697
gave you a 35-minute
cook tonight.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.699
- What was going
through your mind?
- I'm a person

31:07.733 --> 31:09.868
that they might feel
threatened by.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.904
Honestly, I was expecting
30 minutes.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.106
Emily, describe the dish,
please.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.742
I have dried porcini mushrooms,
little Worcestershire sauce,

31:16.775 --> 31:20.947
and grated shallot,
and then gravy is a brandy,

31:20.980 --> 31:23.115
Matsutake mushroom gravy.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.251
And then I roasted off
my green beans,

31:25.284 --> 31:27.486
some almonds
and lemon zest.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.589
Mm.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.294
It is seriously delicious.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.697
Great seasoning, great color,
great sear on the steak.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.566
Beans got a lot of flavor.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.968
Potatoes, nice.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.402
Visually, it looks
a little bit clumpy.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.037
Just give it a bit
more finesse.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.806
But, you know, 35.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.943
I think you could've nailed
this in 25, to be honest.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.278
Good job. Thank you.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.785
The next home cook
wearing Aarón's apron,

31:59.818 --> 32:02.989
she had just 30 minutes
to cook, Julia.

32:03.022 --> 32:06.458
Julia; This was one of
the most stressful 30 minutes
of my life.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.260
You know, a lot of other people
had a lot more time

32:08.294 --> 32:10.262
to incorporate more flavors
into their dish

32:10.296 --> 32:11.930
that I just didn't
have the time for.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.933
So, I just hope I don't
disappoint Chef Aarón.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.304
Tell me about the dish.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.906
I put some garlic,
shallots, an egg,

32:20.939 --> 32:23.342
a little salt and pepper,
oregano,

32:23.375 --> 32:24.676
and a little bit
of bread crumb.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.179
So, this is like
an Italian meatloaf

32:27.213 --> 32:29.481
with all that kind
of seasoning in there.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.817
You added these tomatoes,
which I think are irrelevant.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.419
Why'd you add the tomatoes?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.487
I just tomatoes and green beans
together in a salad.

32:35.521 --> 32:39.158
But you sliced it.
Why'd you do that?

32:39.191 --> 32:43.329
You understood that the idea
was to mimic this, right?

32:43.362 --> 32:46.632
- Um...
- You understood that?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.167
Yeah.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.877
Joe:
Julia, your Salisbury steak,

32:58.910 --> 33:01.713
you sliced it.
Why'd you do that?

33:01.747 --> 33:06.218
You understood that the idea
was to mimic this, right?

33:06.252 --> 33:07.919
Yeah.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.493
I have to say...

33:14.526 --> 33:18.664
it's one of the best flavored
dishes I've tried so far.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.732
Your potatoes are
perfectly cooked.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.868
Your mushroom sauce
is profound.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.870
You kind of used all your time
to your advantage.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.538
- Great dish.
- Thank you.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.244
Next up, from the home cook
that Aarón gave an apron to,

33:32.278 --> 33:34.813
Lindsay, please.
Let's go.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.249
Having had a lot of Salisbury
steak TV dinners growing up,

33:37.283 --> 33:40.486
I'm gonna show that
you can take those flavors
of your childhood,

33:40.519 --> 33:42.088
and do something fresh with it,

33:42.121 --> 33:44.022
and the judges are
gonna love it.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.691
- Right, Lindsay.
- Yes.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.659
Describe the dish here.

33:47.693 --> 33:51.097
So I have a lamb and beef
Salisbury steak

33:51.130 --> 33:52.998
with a porcini
mushroom crust.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.866
It's got some roasted
mushrooms on top,

33:54.900 --> 33:57.736
and fresh salad on the side
with the blanched green beans.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.345
You know...

34:06.378 --> 34:08.714
that meat is...

34:08.747 --> 34:09.781
disgusting.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.750
( gasps, stifled laughter )

34:13.419 --> 34:16.188
It's dry and then I've got
dried mushrooms.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.789
They were just stuck
in the oven.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.691
There's no color
on those things.

34:19.725 --> 34:25.564
Linds, when the best thing of
your dish is a green bean salad,

34:25.597 --> 34:28.634
that upsets me.
Thank you, Lindsay.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.336
Thank you, Chef.

34:34.340 --> 34:37.576
The next home cook has
Gordon's apron.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.845
S.J., let's see what you got.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.484
- S.J., explain
your Salisbury steak.
- How are you, Chef?

34:45.517 --> 34:49.921
A Salisbury steak
with fondant potatoes,

34:49.955 --> 34:52.424
mushroom gravy,
and sautéed green beans.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.930
I love the gravy.
I think it's extremely
well-balanced.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.300
If I had to take you
to task on something,

35:01.333 --> 35:03.302
it's a lot of potato
for very little protein.

35:03.335 --> 35:06.071
- Right.
- The star is
the Salisbury steak,

35:06.104 --> 35:07.573
and let me tell you,
you knocked it out.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.607
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.345
Gordon: Right. Next up,
wearing Joe's apron,

35:13.379 --> 35:14.446
Gerron.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.819
It is a Salisbury steak
stuffed with bacon
and white cheddar,

35:20.852 --> 35:23.855
pan-seared green beans
in bacon fat.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.392
I then also added a layer
of fried onions on top.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.999
- It's delicious.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.867
I love the cheese
and the bacon element.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.937
And the p♪té, just so soft
and delicious and rich.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.706
You just wanna dive back
in there for more.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.107
- Amazing.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.509
Joe: The next home cook,

35:43.542 --> 35:46.778
wearing Gordon Ramsay's apron,
Ashley.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
So this looks very much in
the spirit of the original dish.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.616
What seasoning did
you put in here?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.851
Greek oregano,
smoked paprika,

35:52.884 --> 35:54.953
and then I made fondant
potatoes,

35:54.986 --> 35:57.389
string beans almondine,

35:57.423 --> 35:59.891
in a red wine
mushroom gravy.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.194
So the potatoes are
perfectly cooked.

36:02.228 --> 36:05.063
- Thank you.
- Really soft, well seasoned.

36:05.096 --> 36:08.400
The meat's a little
bit bland.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.536
The best thing about
this dish is your sauce.
It's really on point.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.837
Thanks, Joe.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.877
Finally, the home cook
that Aarón gave an apron to.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.479
Chelsea, please.
Let's go.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.013
Chelsea: I think I did
a really good job.

36:22.047 --> 36:23.682
I mean, I don't eat
frozen meals,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.217
but this seems like something
I can make for my dad.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.386
He loves fresh green beans.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.020
I think I should do
really well,

36:29.054 --> 36:30.889
and I just really hope
the judges like it.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.225
Chelsea, how many times
have you eaten a frozen dinner?

36:33.259 --> 36:35.494
I don't think I ever have.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.363
- Never?
- No.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.431
Living in the Middle East and
growing up everywhere I lived,

36:39.465 --> 36:41.900
we didn't really eat
that kinda food.

36:41.933 --> 36:45.070
Well, you cooked
with 45 minutes tonight.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.705
You know there's three
individuals behind you

36:46.738 --> 36:50.276
that have been dealt
a dysfunctional card tonight.

36:50.309 --> 36:54.713
So, visually, yours looks
worse than theirs.

36:54.746 --> 36:58.950
- If I take that away,
holy sugar!
- Yeah.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.587
It's like a vegetarian buffet.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.389
I just put too much
on the plate.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.225
- And you know how
to plate well, right?
- Yes.

37:07.259 --> 37:08.460
Describe the dish, please.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.462
I made Salisbury steak

37:10.496 --> 37:13.098
with mushroom
and pearl onion gravy,

37:13.131 --> 37:15.100
garlic green beans
with salt,

37:15.133 --> 37:18.304
and the roasted potatoes,
I parboiled them really quickly

37:18.337 --> 37:19.638
and then I finished them
in the oven.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.140
Quite rare there.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.742
So, sort of medium muddy.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.379
Potatoes actually taste
better than they look.

37:27.413 --> 37:28.947
Look at that.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.450
I can't distinguish
which one looks better.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.285
At this stage
in the competition,

37:33.319 --> 37:36.254
I just want to see
a little bit more finesse.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.824
I look at that and it's like
somebody can't be bothered.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.959
- Thank you.
- I'm just disappointed.

37:40.992 --> 37:45.130
I usually plate so perfectly
and with finesse.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.632
I think that maybe
I was just making it

37:46.665 --> 37:48.434
for my family
and not for the judges.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.436
- A no-brainer, right?
- Yeah, missed the mark.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.971
Aarón: I might be losing
one of my strongest cooks.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.441
They were really upset
with what I produced today

37:55.474 --> 37:58.276
and I hate
that I disappointed Aarón.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.521
Everyone,
I think it's safe to say

38:09.555 --> 38:10.522
that that was
a tough challenge.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.458
Yes, Chef.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.760
Aarón: Now, at least
one home cook

38:14.793 --> 38:16.428
is leaving tonight.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.196
Can you all please come down
to the front?

38:18.229 --> 38:20.699
I'm shocked that I messed up
so badly.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.201
This is a hard competition
and I never give up,

38:23.234 --> 38:25.704
but, I mean,
I didn't do my best.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.274
So, I'm just hoping that they
know that I'll learn from this

38:29.307 --> 38:30.709
and they should give me
another chance.

38:30.742 --> 38:33.278
So, before we move on
to the bad news,

38:33.311 --> 38:36.815
we want to celebrate
and recognize great
performances.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.786
Four of you excelled
and knocked it out of the park.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.889
Congratulations...

38:43.922 --> 38:47.325
S.J., Emily, Gerron...

38:47.359 --> 38:49.461
- Thank you.
- and one more home cook

38:49.495 --> 38:51.329
that had just 30 minutes.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.632
Julia, do you have anything
to say to those people

38:53.665 --> 38:56.668
that gave you limited time
and that doubted you?

38:56.702 --> 38:58.837
I'm here to stay.
I'm not going anywhere.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.973
So, the bad news,

39:02.007 --> 39:05.844
Chelsea, Lindsay,

39:06.845 --> 39:08.647
and...

39:08.680 --> 39:10.348
Shanika.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.484
One of you will be
heading home tonight.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.253
Can everybody else
please head to the balcony?

39:15.286 --> 39:17.923
Julia: I am so proud walking
up to this balcony.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.758
I was given the least
amount of time,

39:19.791 --> 39:22.494
and I completely excelled.
I gotta let 'em know.

39:22.528 --> 39:25.597
You better move the hell over
and make some space for me

39:25.631 --> 39:28.033
because I'm not going anywhere.

39:28.066 --> 39:33.839
Gordon:
We have three very talented,
amazing home cooks.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.174
One's wearing Joe's apron,

39:36.207 --> 39:40.446
and two are wearing aprons
from Aarón,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.881
but only one will
be leaving tonight.

39:42.914 --> 39:46.718
And that person tonight
overreached.

39:46.752 --> 39:51.623
They over-thought,
and ultimately,
they under-delivered.

39:51.657 --> 39:56.161
The person leaving
the MasterChef kitchen is...

39:59.431 --> 40:00.932
...Lindsay.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.136
( whispers )
Oh, my God.

40:05.170 --> 40:09.475
Shanika, Chelsea,
head up to the safety
of the balcony, please.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.243
Wow!

40:12.277 --> 40:14.880
Lindsay, I think the idea
of something so simple

40:14.913 --> 40:18.049
like a Salisbury steak
tripped you up a little bit,

40:18.083 --> 40:19.451
but I gave you my apron
for a reason.

40:19.485 --> 40:21.286
You have such a fighting spirit.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.821
You're resilient.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.756
I think that dream of a B&B

40:24.790 --> 40:26.492
with your wife
is well within your grasp,

40:26.525 --> 40:28.994
and I want you to please
continue to do that.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.396
- Tonight wasn't your night.
- No.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.733
Gordon:
Please, place your apron
on your bench and good night.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.569
- Thank you.
- Bye, Lindsay.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.671
I think I'm a true testament
to the fact

40:39.705 --> 40:42.140
that you're never too old
to start following a new dream.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.510
I'm a successful
trial attorney.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.112
And you know what?
I was successful in making it
to "MasterChef."

40:47.145 --> 40:49.648
So, I'm going home
to my beautiful wife

40:49.681 --> 40:51.850
and we're gonna continue
with our culinary dream

40:51.883 --> 40:53.251
of having
that bed and breakfast

40:53.284 --> 40:55.987
and fine dining restaurant
on Cape Cod.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.927
Joe:
So, just 15 home cooks remain.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
You know, with Matt and Lindsay
going home this week,

41:03.995 --> 41:06.264
each judge
has five aprons left.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.500
I think the competition is just
gonna get stiffer from here.

41:08.534 --> 41:11.770
From now on, it gets
more and more intense.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.539
The heat is really gonna
get turned up.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.675
So, I am gonna make sure that
the next person to go is not me.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.977
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.382
- Narrator: Next time...
- We are going to try
something different.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.718
- ...the top 15...
- Joe: Find a partner
right away.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.220
- Yo, guys. What's up?
- ...team up...

41:29.254 --> 41:30.789
for a game of Chicken.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.391
- Come on.
- Five well-known ingredients.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.694
I am not having a good time
getting this off.

41:35.727 --> 41:36.895
- Whoo!
- What the hell?

41:36.928 --> 41:38.396
Who mauled this?

41:38.429 --> 41:39.865
I've seen better
at "Junior MasterChef."

41:39.898 --> 41:41.900
Piece of cake.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.970
And then, a grueling challenge
returns.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.237
- Contestants: Ooh!
- Oh!

41:46.271 --> 41:48.540
A dish that strikes fear

41:48.574 --> 41:50.909
in the heart of every home cook.

41:50.942 --> 41:51.943
( whistles )
