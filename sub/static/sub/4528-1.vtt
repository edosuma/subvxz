WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.302
How about this
happens around you?

00:05.372 --> 00:08.934
He began with Good Will Hunting, and then
XO,

00:09.142 --> 00:11.941
and have passed 18 months.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.275
Yes I do not know.

00:17.284 --> 00:20.982
I know things are different

00:21.054 --> 00:24.547
because people makes me different questions.

00:24.625 --> 00:29.290
But I do not feel that things have changed a lot
.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.764
Just... Still...

00:31.832 --> 00:34.893
I do the same things he did.

00:36.403 --> 00:39.100
I think the same things, so...

00:39.172 --> 00:44.076
once said: "I'll never be
a rock star."

00:45.345 --> 00:49.578
I said it because I think it's true.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.983
But do not try to avoid anything.

00:52.052 --> 00:56.012
Would have to be more...

00:56.089 --> 01:02.029
I'm not... I'm not the right person
to be famous and large.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.810
Miss Misery
You touched on the nomination of the Oscar,

01:50.877 --> 01:54.245
how did you feel?
A little punk too?

01:54.314 --> 01:57.148
It was very strange.

01:57.217 --> 02:00.244
It was quite fun for a day.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.620
I do not know if it would be fun to live in that world.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.193
But it was fun. Very funny.

02:09.262 --> 02:13.131
Not sure if that was...
I would not say it was punk at all.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.669
But it was fun.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.639
Were all these famous singers

02:19.706 --> 02:23.768
and said, "Who is that guy?".

02:23.844 --> 02:25.005
Will Hunting "Miss Misery"

02:25.078 --> 02:26.068
The white suit?

02:26.146 --> 02:30.675
"The white suit with messy hair?".

02:30.751 --> 02:35.587
"That did not sell millions of records
What the hell are you doing here.?".

02:35.656 --> 02:38.057
I wondered Io same.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.425
Elliott was our secret for our fans.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.329
And then touched Good Will Hunting

02:45.399 --> 02:50.201
and everyone realized who it was.

02:50.270 --> 02:54.105
And I do not hate success.
I wanted more people to hear his music.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.509
But that meant many changes for him.

03:00.547 --> 03:06.487
Io was hard to see that it was hard for him fame.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.784
And only going to be worse.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.882
After hearing the song
it would be nominated for an Oscar,

03:12.492 --> 03:15.291
I had to do many interviews.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.887
Every morning went to study

03:16.963 --> 03:20.525
and the first hour or more
he spent in interviews saying:

03:20.701 --> 03:23.865
"No, Gus did not discover me."

03:24.171 --> 03:30.008
"I got six albums with the band
Three and three alone.".

03:30.077 --> 03:31.909
"No, not only played in cafés".

03:31.978 --> 03:36.348
Every day, all morning.
The same interview, again and again,

03:36.416 --> 03:38.442
and clear, Io journalists not know,

03:38.518 --> 03:40.077
not even investigated.

03:40.387 --> 03:45.155
Now he must play the
Oscar and seen as an indie-rock types.

03:45.225 --> 03:49.788
I think it was Io worst thing that could happen, somehow
.

03:50.931 --> 03:56.529
It was totally strange that a person
and I were in that program.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.372
Was a rare situation.

04:01.441 --> 04:05.674
Very rare.
And that was funny.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.774
Would not do it again.
I did not feel nervous.

04:12.319 --> 04:16.017
But it seemed like everything was happening in slow motion
.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.594
The musician Elliott Smith died yesterday in Los Angeles.

04:22.662 --> 04:23.652
OCTOBER 2003

04:23.730 --> 04:27.792
While many news
Io described as a possible suicide,

04:27.868 --> 04:30.667
police forensics
not determined the cause of death.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.037
Which includes five acclaimed solo albums

04:37.210 --> 04:39.611
and an Oscar nomination for Best Song
The singer of 34 years
his career, struggled.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.392
Elliott you're free...

04:59.566 --> 05:03.901
This was a few days before that Elliott was
the air.

05:04.070 --> 05:08.235
I went to Los Angeles and I was called, was a number
Beverly Hills

05:08.308 --> 05:12.473
and I said, "Maybe it's Luke
to confirm the radio interview."

05:12.546 --> 05:17.075
Was another friend of mine who told me that Elliott had died
.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.367
RIP Elliott Smith

05:36.770 --> 05:40.935
MTV said to have died, and people
calls.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.112
And then I said,

05:46.179 --> 05:47.272
miss you ELLIOTT

05:47.347 --> 05:48.474
"It's just a rumor,"

05:48.548 --> 05:50.642
because there were many rumors in Los Angeles.

05:50.750 --> 05:55.950
Elliott Smith, 34; Composer, singer Bittersweet...

06:01.528 --> 06:04.191
Thank Your music means a lot to me

06:04.364 --> 06:06.560
IMPORTANT SOMEONE WERE

06:10.337 --> 06:12.738
That day, I...

06:12.806 --> 06:15.776
was angry with the universe,
with industry.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.971
Said: "Why?".

06:19.045 --> 06:21.708
"Why did that happen?".

06:26.519 --> 06:30.183
Dear Elliott,
I want to thank you for bringing beautiful music to the world...

06:34.828 --> 06:38.526
My wife called me and said:
"I have terrible news."

06:38.598 --> 06:40.089
I was very shocked.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.762
And she said, "Yes, Elliott... Elliott Io had made

06:43.904 --> 06:45.133
." And he died "

06:57.550 --> 07:01.419
I took a train and went home

07:01.488 --> 07:03.081
And that was very good,

07:03.156 --> 07:08.493
because train travel
put you in a situation

07:08.561 --> 07:13.499
where you sit, the landscape passes
,

07:13.667 --> 07:17.798
and can accommodate your emotions

07:18.004 --> 07:20.132
and all other Io

07:46.900 --> 07:49.995
I sat down, I was in the dining car

07:50.070 --> 07:54.235
with
an elderly couple who were on their honeymoon.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.209
They had 80 years and were newlyweds,

07:57.277 --> 07:59.803
And traveling the country by train.

07:59.879 --> 08:03.316
We dined together and had a strange conversation,

08:03.383 --> 08:04.851
and it was fun,

08:05.251 --> 08:10.918
and trying to return to life.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.907
And suddenly, the old couple said:

08:35.081 --> 08:38.916
"Did you know that crazy singer

08:38.985 --> 08:41.352
" to be stabbed in the heart?

08:41.453 --> 08:42.751
"Who can do that

08:42.822 --> 08:45.621
?" I could not imagine being able to do that physically
"

08:45.692 --> 08:48.457
thought." What the hell?
What happens here "

08:48.528 --> 08:50.622
How do these people know that

09:11.718 --> 09:12.879
AIR

09:12.986 --> 09:18.152
It's called Angeles, is Elliott Smith live
KCRW Morning Becomes Eclectic.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.624
'm Chris Douridas.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.252
Elliott will be in the record store
No Life at 7:30 today

09:22.328 --> 09:25.457
Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood,
and tomorrow at Spaceland.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.795
Welcome to KCRW, Elliott.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.892
Thanks. Thanks for inviting.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.427
We hoped to have you on the show a while and...

09:32.505 --> 09:34.974
anyway
I'm glad you finally came.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.065
Thanks.

09:36.142 --> 09:39.874
How do you play guitar?
How do you write songs?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.438
Since I was 14 years old.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.609
How did you learn?

09:44.684 --> 09:46.676
How autodidact
listening to records and so on?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.520
If I recorded songs from the radio,

09:50.590 --> 09:54.550
he played a note, "This is not."
The other note: "This is not."

09:55.728 --> 09:57.560
- By process of elimination. .
- Yes

09:57.630 --> 10:01.829
Lives in Portland area for some time.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.096
Are you there?

10:03.169 --> 10:07.163
I grew up in Texas, but I live in Portland
long.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.175
- What part of Texas?
- Dallas.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.040
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.444
Elliott was born in Omaha.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.215
My mother and father were separated

10:22.288 --> 10:23.278
sister Ashley Elliott Welch

10:23.423 --> 10:26.552
When he was one year
and moved to Dallas.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.324
When I was four,

10:30.396 --> 10:33.958
our mother and father were married
and moved to a house.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.299
Y
Elliott was seven years old when I was born.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.204
Remember Io chased

10:40.507 --> 10:43.136
and wanted to see what he did.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.838
My mother said that he talked too much,

10:45.912 --> 10:48.780
began to speak since childhood, loved to sing
,

10:48.848 --> 10:51.909
and seemed to be a very happy child.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.490
Music is important for our family
Io always has been.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.791
Elliott met in sixth grade,
in literature class,

11:02.862 --> 11:03.852
Steve  "Pickle" Pickering
childhood friend

11:03.930 --> 11:05.592
when Io still called Steve.

11:07.934 --> 11:11.336
The two competed to be the class clowns.

11:11.404 --> 11:16.138
And so we get along
from the beginning.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.609
I do not remember how I asked Io,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.737
but it was something like: "Do you play an instrument?".

11:19.812 --> 11:23.613
Obviously, other than the saxophone,
I learned in the band.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.914
I said, "Yeah, I play the piano.".

11:25.985 --> 11:27.886
And he said, "I also play the piano."

11:30.523 --> 11:32.355
And started from there.

11:32.425 --> 11:36.385
And the main focus of our activities turned.

11:36.462 --> 11:41.298
Elliott thought we all would join

11:41.367 --> 11:44.030
and organized the band.

11:46.539 --> 11:51.068
Sometimes we practiced at home, but often
was in my house.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.706
Depended on the mother who could lead
,

11:54.781 --> 11:58.149
and sibling
do another activity.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.915
It was great to have a sister six years
close

12:00.987 --> 12:03.047
when you did that.

12:03.122 --> 12:07.526
Began writing songs
most with the guitar. Instrumentals.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.790
I never thought to do that.

12:09.862 --> 12:14.698
If you're busy playing
Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin,

12:14.767 --> 12:16.759
is great. It is great on its own.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.408
When I had more experience in composing
,

12:24.477 --> 12:26.537
songs became longer,

12:26.613 --> 12:30.778
had more parts,
and started playing different styles.

12:30.917 --> 12:35.013
When I hear his later songs,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.886
sound like him.

12:36.956 --> 12:41.519
Because Io do much
heard that <i> fingerpicking</i>

12:41.594 --> 12:43.460
when I was 13 or 14 years.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.636
I do not remember when it was.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.275
I know that after they moved in,

12:57.343 --> 12:59.744
all the time  expected to return.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.783
What brought you to Portland?

13:06.853 --> 13:10.051
Do your parents, or were there in the school?

13:10.123 --> 13:14.959
I moved there as a child.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.198
Not talk about that.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.766
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.502
At one point in the interview where
begin to track their movements

13:33.579 --> 13:35.639
for the country and how it grew,

13:35.715 --> 13:39.277
and inspired
moving from Dallas to Portland.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.618
And to be so honest,

13:42.689 --> 13:45.284
begins to explain

13:45.358 --> 13:49.557
why it was better to leave
Dallas in the past.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.030
And then he realizes that he is
air, I think,

13:52.098 --> 13:53.259
Chris Douridas KCRW Radio presenter Los Angeles

13:53.366 --> 13:56.666
Io thinks best,
and returns to the guitar.

13:56.769 --> 14:01.901
Feel some relief when
stops talking about it.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.011
Not along very well with my father.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.014
It is quite obvious.

14:08.648 --> 14:12.107
I do not know if he was in eighth or ninth year

14:12.185 --> 14:13.676
when he decided to move to Portland.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.820
When he returned to Texas,
in July or August 1984

14:20.927 --> 14:22.361
had a lot of songs.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.428
One of them was a song called Outward Bound
.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.903
It's basically a song for Oregon.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.906
This is the great Northwest.

14:35.441 --> 14:41.142
At the time, I thought it was a message to
Texas:

14:41.247 --> 14:42.943
"Since I left friends.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.883
"And even return visit,
this is not my home."

14:46.285 --> 14:50.814
Was clear he liked Portland.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.418
And there wanted to be.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.241
One, two, three.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.912
Lincoln High HEADQUARTERS OF CARDINAL

15:20.586 --> 15:25.752
was in third year
and played flute in the school band.

15:25.825 --> 15:30.456
And another friend of mine,
one day to the end of the class he said:

15:30.530 --> 15:32.294
"You should meet this guy,

15:32.365 --> 15:33.628
" is also a great fan of Rush "

15:33.733 --> 15:35.031
Musician Tony Lash
<. i> Stranger Than ficti  or <i> n </i>, Heatmiser

15:35.168 --> 15:37.967
was wearing my shirt Rush
or Io Elliott That was it..

15:54.520 --> 15:57.854
I do not remember very well to say that we get good
a,

15:57.924 --> 16:01.486
but it seems that we became fast friends.

16:07.433 --> 16:11.666
Instrumental songs that I wrote...

16:11.904 --> 16:15.363
not worked when he was 12 o13.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.538
Why they not work?

16:17.844 --> 16:21.508
I do not know. Because they were not good.

16:22.014 --> 16:25.951
VOCAL MUSIC

16:27.320 --> 16:29.687
And this was with guitar, live?

16:30.022 --> 16:34.289
Some other.
Most were with piano at that time,

16:34.460 --> 16:39.262
because I took one years
classes as a kid.

16:45.705 --> 16:50.541
Had armed the Stranger Than Fiction
group with Jason and Garrick.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.674
They had a couple of songs that I heard

16:54.747 --> 16:56.375
And he wanted to be their producer.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.077
Already he aspired to be a producer at that time.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.712
But it was not until the last year
I started playing drums with them

17:01.787 --> 17:04.621
and recorded the album Still Waters
More Or Less.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.492
Were four discs of Stranger Than Fiction.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.228
The first
Io did before I started working with them,

17:15.300 --> 17:16.894
junior year in high school.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.872
Then Still Waters More Or Less
where played and produced with them.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.407
And they made one more,
but did not participate in that.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.138
And one more after

17:26.212 --> 17:27.680
I recorded with them.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.646
She became very good with the guitar.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.652
And with piano and drums.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.483

17:35.555 --> 17:37.717
made do with bass lines.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.658
And discovered how I wanted to sing.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.196
Sometimes
tried to sing like Joe Strummer,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.758
sometimes as Elvis Costello.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.635
Sound like Joe Strummer cold.

17:54.707 --> 17:55.834
Io not stand.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.877
I love Joe Strummer, but I'm not him.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.273
When time passed and Elliott took confidence
,

18:01.347 --> 18:03.179
are more letters written by Elliott,

18:03.249 --> 18:04.239
Alumnus Kevin Moyer Lincoln High

18:04.317 --> 18:06.218
Elliott and voices.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.223
Many of those songs secondary

18:11.290 --> 18:14.954
the recycled and used for albums
Heatmiser and soloists.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.330
Elliott finished high school, went to college
and returned,

18:24.403 --> 18:27.532
formed another band,
A Murder of Crows, with Garrick Duckler.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.581
Every summer had another project to do.

18:39.752 --> 18:44.656
A Murder of Crows,
Harum Scarum with Tony and Jason.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.790
Harum Scarum was one of a series...

18:52.865 --> 18:55.733
I think we did four projects

18:55.801 --> 19:00.136
where I helped several things,
when Elliott returned to the city.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.912
Yes I think it was one of those things
we did in a month,

19:07.980 --> 19:12.179
during the summer of 1989 perhaps.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.515
I do not know why we do not change the name
Harum Scarum,

19:14.587 --> 19:18.183
because we were four again
Jason Garrick, Elliott and me.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.886
After making Harum Scarum,
Neil met and began playing with it.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.453
When he and I talked,
he started talking about Heatmiser

19:24.563 --> 19:28.261
and asked me to play,
Neil had heard the tape of Harum Scarum

19:28.334 --> 19:29.529
and he liked my drums,

19:29.602 --> 19:31.594
and were
thinking about returning to Portland.

19:31.871 --> 19:32.964
Elliott Smith, April 1996

19:33.039 --> 19:34.405
Local  Rob Show KWVA 88.1
Eugene, Oregon

19:34.473 --> 19:38.035
Okay.
Someone is downstairs.

19:41.580 --> 19:46.678
My name is Rob and I'm talking to Elliott Smith

19:46.786 --> 19:50.746
band
Elliott Smith and Heatmiser.

19:51.290 --> 19:55.728
I just have a few questions and listen to songs
,

19:55.795 --> 19:58.788
and we will begin.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.458
Some things he asked me.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.762
How Heatmiser started?
I knew that you were in...

20:05.838 --> 20:08.398
- You met another guitarist...
- Yes Neil..

20:08.474 --> 20:11.273
... Neil, in Massachusetts.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.436
- Sure.
- At Hampshire College.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.606
We played together there.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.678
And we used to do acoustic shows.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.686
And then we moved here,

20:20.753 --> 20:24.713
because I had a high school friend who played drums
, Tony.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.022
And he wanted... I wanted to play.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.394
Going to go to Chicago, but then wanted to play
,

20:31.464 --> 20:33.228
- so we moved here.
- All right.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.101
North Hampton was pretty cute,

20:36.168 --> 20:40.230
but in the summer, the boys were
,

20:40.306 --> 20:42.605
- and the villagers came out...
- Yes

20:42.675 --> 20:46.703
... and began to tell me things and
. he walked down the street.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.744
One guy told me "dirt"
while walking down the street.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.252
- Going to work, was a baker.
- Yes.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.084
Was all dressed in white.

20:56.155 --> 21:00.217
I was wearing a uniform Baker

21:00.292 --> 21:02.523
and this guy went through a truck
and shouted: "Filth!".

21:04.263 --> 21:05.526
That makes sense.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.830
Never had called me that, and especially

21:08.901 --> 21:12.099
- because I am immaculate.
- If it is okay.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.811
I think there's a whole generation of kids,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.710
that they know their music

21:20.780 --> 21:23.477
and go crazy when they see your rocker side.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.683
In the early 90s, music
Portland

21:31.757 --> 21:35.091
was as vibrant as today.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.153
But it had not been discovered.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.927
Neil and Elliott came to here, and met
.

21:41.333 --> 21:45.668
We started working a little
without a bassist.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.537
We found Brandt,
and it was a great bass player

21:48.607 --> 21:51.304
and fit right away.

21:52.511 --> 21:55.913
Neil and I let people seek Elliott and contacts

21:56.048 --> 21:57.516
because he felt

21:57.583 --> 21:59.984
they had the direction of the band,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.851
and it was important to feel comfortable.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.025
Portland was quite insular
at that time and was less crowded.

22:08.093 --> 22:11.530
There were not many people playing

22:11.597 --> 22:14.761
not many places that have alternative shows.

22:15.301 --> 22:18.032
At that time, if you did that, you cruzabas
others.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.265
Everyone said:
"I love Portland's great.".

22:20.339 --> 22:21.466
Jarosz Janel Music, Queen Trailer

22:21.540 --> 22:23.236
Especially if they were interested in music.

22:24.443 --> 22:28.380
I came to Portland in '87, early 88

22:28.948 --> 22:32.715
and six months, was playing in Satyricon
,

22:32.785 --> 22:33.878
Musician Pete Krebs, Hazel

22:34.153 --> 22:35.815
X-Ray

22:35.921 --> 22:39.050
and then Blue Gallery, a little.

22:39.124 --> 22:40.558
And those were the three places.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.960
At that time in Portland was

22:44.029 --> 22:47.625
the latter part of the first wave

22:47.700 --> 22:51.501
alternative music of Portland.

22:51.570 --> 22:55.007
There had been
punk rock and hard-core and...

22:55.140 --> 22:58.941
Everything in Portland was slower,
after hard-core,

22:59.011 --> 23:01.037
post punk bands soon appeared,

23:01.113 --> 23:05.915
appeared in Portland after Los Angeles and New York.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.945
Portland was at that time
a stagnant city.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.320
Was the staging point

23:11.390 --> 23:14.121
between a show in San Francisco
and a show in Seattle.

23:14.193 --> 23:17.630
He was one of the owners of the fabulous coffee
X-Ray.

23:17.696 --> 23:21.030
Was open from 1990 to 1994.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.194
it was a place for all ages.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.896
It was good to have a place to play for all ages
.

23:30.509 --> 23:34.810
Popped while all these groups.

23:37.449 --> 23:41.944
We did lots of shows with Hazel,
Crackerbash, Sprinkler and Pond.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.185
The group of typical bands of that era.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.852
And we were loud and we were angry at the time.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.951
Joanna Bolme Music, Calamity Jane, Jr. High

23:49.028 --> 23:52.897
The seal of those bands was
loud guitars and screaming singers.

23:53.032 --> 23:56.230
A period in which Portland
trying to create their own sound

23:56.302 --> 23:58.203
or brand that distinguished Io

23:58.270 --> 24:00.398
Io happened in Seattle.

24:00.472 --> 24:03.465
We were influenced by bands like The Pixies and Big Black,

24:03.542 --> 24:06.774
And the things that happened in Touch and Go
and on the East Coast.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.479
The Spud Boys were amazing.

24:10.616 --> 24:14.917
The brothers Slusarenko
invited us to join a cover band Devo.

24:14.987 --> 24:19.755
With Sam Coomes, Elliott and me.

24:23.595 --> 24:27.088
It was with that Elliott and I met well.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.693
I know that when I first touch
a Heatmiser, said:

24:33.339 --> 24:35.069
"My God, the Portland Fugazi".

24:35.174 --> 24:38.611
Heatmiser left the punk.
Elliott left there.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.613
I think there are a lot
Io happened with punk

24:41.747 --> 24:45.445
was
to make room for something that would come later.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.422
Io Those guys knew they were doing musically.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.687
And the guy who played guitar was
very good.

24:53.759 --> 24:58.026
For 93 or 94, when the moon
had become the focus

24:58.097 --> 25:02.000
was great to lead so many people to a show.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.462
The bands get along,
it was a great fellowship.

25:06.538 --> 25:08.200
And I think it showed

25:08.273 --> 25:10.174
on the way out shows,

25:10.275 --> 25:13.643
and why so many people
connects to the period.

25:13.879 --> 25:15.973
Each sound has its time.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.813
Y
many bands now that are at the top,

25:18.884 --> 25:21.649
and for a bit, for a couple of years,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.848
We were on top.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.288
Can we have more voices
on monitors?

25:27.493 --> 25:31.260
When we started and launched the first record

25:31.597 --> 25:34.260
we had been together only six months or so.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.992
We knew what we wanted to do.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.464
We got carried

25:39.538 --> 25:44.442
with a sound that appeared.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.470
As many bands with their first record

25:46.545 --> 25:48.844
've spent enough time

25:49.381 --> 25:52.374
arming songs and playing shows.

26:00.225 --> 26:05.357
Was much longer do
songs as we played live.

26:07.699 --> 26:12.330
She sang very rare.
Io always sang louder as he could.

26:12.504 --> 26:13.494
Yes.

26:13.705 --> 26:19.008
It was loudest possible Io.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.906
Now I can not hear those recordings.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.481
It's interesting when I hear songs from the first album
now

26:25.551 --> 26:28.214
how muscular he was.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.846
Just we felt we wanted it will rock.

26:32.057 --> 26:34.993
When it ended, I sent the disks

26:35.060 --> 26:37.427
Lisa Fancher Frontier Records

26:37.496 --> 26:39.931
and said, "I think you will like this band."

26:39.998 --> 26:44.698
She loved
recording and flew from Los Angeles to Portland,

26:44.770 --> 26:47.262
and we all went to dinner one night.

26:47.339 --> 26:51.834
Were at the Thai restaurant,
remember, at 39 and Division.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.845
After dinner, we go out,

26:53.912 --> 26:56.939
never forget this,
it was the sweetest of all.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.415
Elliott turned to me and said:

26:58.484 --> 27:01.886
"Dude, it's the first time that my art
pays me dinner."

27:03.188 --> 27:05.987
- Is that all? That is all?
- I think so.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.526
Heatmiser in radio show "Pandora's Box"
KBOO, Portland

27:07.593 --> 27:09.721
Thanks. Why do not you go
to the rec room?

27:09.795 --> 27:13.732
Because we will be part of the special interview segment.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.597
And Dave will talk with you in a second.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.067
You want to stay here? It's okay.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.935
We will be here to play and laugh.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.245
We will ask each

27:33.318 --> 27:34.684
and I want to answer honestly.

27:34.753 --> 27:35.948
- Each?
- Yes

27:36.021 --> 27:38.855
Elliott, boxers or briefs.?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.857
Dave, you ask?

27:42.661 --> 27:45.096
Okay.
Actually Io to talk about today...

27:45.164 --> 27:47.224
- None.
-... Is the album, right?

27:47.299 --> 27:49.200
- What's it called?
- Our new album?

27:49.268 --> 27:50.634
Yes, the new album, how?

27:50.702 --> 27:52.227
Pop and Heater.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.365
- Is called Cop And Speeder.
- Croppy Speeder.

27:56.441 --> 28:00.173
I hear it all the time
and I really like those songs.

28:00.245 --> 28:03.010
Video, who is the dancer?

28:03.081 --> 28:04.606
- Marc
- Marc

28:04.683 --> 28:07.312
- Swanson's last name, such as meals.
- It's okay.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.752
That was good.

28:09.988 --> 28:14.653
Neil called me and told me that I was wanted

28:14.726 --> 28:17.321
in one of his videos, dancing.

28:18.463 --> 28:21.058
We stopped in places with Heatmiser truck,

28:21.400 --> 28:25.235
became very strong, and I stood
music and dancing there.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.480
Okay. Where meet, Elliott?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.676
Portland Because people want to see them before...

28:38.750 --> 28:42.118
Coming together like... like normal people.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.382
"As if" they were normal people.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.425
- As if we were not rock stars.
- Rock stars.

28:46.491 --> 28:47.720
Just like ordinary people.

28:47.793 --> 28:51.025
In fact, Elliott,
are more an asteroid rock.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.098
Thanks, Dave. You're like a meteor.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.225
Where together?
Come on, Elliott, where?

28:57.469 --> 28:58.767
I do not know. In a house?

29:09.047 --> 29:12.142
Got a job with a guy,

29:12.217 --> 29:15.813
removing paint a ceiling with a scaffold
6 meters.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.948
And Elliott got to work with that.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.524
A perfect musician's work.
Hungover, he drank coffee, scraping the ceiling.

29:25.731 --> 29:29.691
I worked a lot with Peter Krebs,
and most were not music.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.304
They say they used to break
chimneys and others?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.533
We did demolition work together,

29:34.606 --> 29:37.405
and we arranged walls

29:37.476 --> 29:41.436
and construction jobs
those that nobody wants to do.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.511
They used to write songs at the time,

29:45.584 --> 29:47.280
when did that work, in your head?

29:47.419 --> 29:50.787
By removing a wall,
no brainer.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.349
How you take care all that free time?

29:54.726 --> 29:59.664
He had recorded the songs that were
in Roman Candle, and had a cassette

29:59.731 --> 30:01.199
Io and I got when we worked.

30:02.034 --> 30:06.062
It was in the basement of JJ.
One of the partners had a 4-Track.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.570
And when I heard that,

30:09.641 --> 30:11.701
had not heard anything like that before.

30:11.777 --> 30:12.904
When he recorded those songs,

30:12.978 --> 30:14.742
may not know what they were.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.509
I did not know if they would be on a disk.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.982
Music
Elliott began to make more sense.

30:19.084 --> 30:22.577
Said. "I'll get out of all this noise,

30:22.654 --> 30:26.284
" sit with my guitar and sing
on how I feel "

30:31.730 --> 30:35.223
If you only listen to the first two albums of Elliott,

30:35.300 --> 30:39.704
Not hear a complete song,
if not hear the words,

30:39.771 --> 30:42.764
not hear where it goes,

30:42.841 --> 30:44.503
only hear the sound for a second,

30:44.576 --> 30:45.600
Slim Moon Label Kill Rock Stars

30:45.677 --> 30:48.613
the People at that time said:
"Sounds like Simon & Garfunkel".

30:52.351 --> 30:56.914
Like many people, the first time I heard
Elliott, I thought something

30:57.022 --> 30:59.514
that if he were alive today, he would be embarrassed
.

30:59.591 --> 31:03.028
I said. "It sounds like Paul Simon
reminds me of Simon & Garfunkel

31:03.095 --> 31:04.461
." It's nice "

31:05.430 --> 31:07.899
One person said it sounded like Paul Simon
..

31:07.966 --> 31:11.869
And everyone else who heard
had to appoint Paul Simon

31:11.937 --> 31:14.702
to say that did not sound like Paul Simon.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.581
"It is the kind of Heatmiser, eh?".

32:06.658 --> 32:09.685
And I said, "Go not sound like Heatmiser
.".

32:09.761 --> 32:11.423
"Sounds more like Nick Drake".

32:11.496 --> 32:16.127
Is
no one imagined it was the same person

32:16.201 --> 32:20.366
screaming and throwing in Heatmiser guitars and others.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.601
But it was clear that this music that played only

32:22.674 --> 32:27.305
Io was he wanted, or where I wanted to go
.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.485
Tammy Watson asked me if I wanted to go to a five soloists,

33:46.558 --> 33:49.892
Would be a quick tour a week
on the West Coast.

33:49.961 --> 33:52.760
I knew all but Elliott.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.426
A Elliott and me
Io asked us did.

33:56.501 --> 33:59.767
There was I impressed

33:59.971 --> 34:01.337
Elliott.

34:01.406 --> 34:05.241
The first night the tour, I did not hear
Io who played Elliott.

34:05.310 --> 34:10.339
Returns, Sean took the stage
addressed the audience and said:

34:10.415 --> 34:12.850
"
Those who arrived late and did not see Elliott Smith

34:12.918 --> 34:14.443
" something important was lost "

34:15.620 --> 34:17.953
was the one who was...

34:18.023 --> 34:20.618
Callaba place silenced the room.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.262
It was very embarrassing and...

34:25.330 --> 34:27.094
Because Elliott played

34:27.165 --> 34:31.226
And everyone was perplexed.

34:32.469 --> 34:36.668
Something happens. It is real and deep,
like a raw nerve.

34:38.743 --> 34:42.077
The next night, I made sure to see
touch Elliott.

34:42.147 --> 34:45.117
I loved the music.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.415
And I went to the truck as
finished playing,

34:49.487 --> 34:50.853
and put the CD,

34:50.956 --> 34:53.187
and did not see anyone else play

34:53.257 --> 34:56.524
because I sat listening to his CD, again and again.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.095
There was an incredible show
when we were on tour,

35:00.165 --> 35:02.600
and I took Margaret Mittleman and say:

35:02.667 --> 35:05.796
"You should see this guy is amazing."

35:05.870 --> 35:08.806
Was a group of people

35:08.873 --> 35:09.932
Representative Margaret Mittleman Elliott

35:10.041 --> 35:13.136
and he sat in a chair,
a folding chair in the corner,

35:13.211 --> 35:16.306
and was touching. It was incredible.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.543
She managed it signed a record deal

35:18.617 --> 35:20.051
and became its representative.

35:20.118 --> 35:24.522
Many disapprove of the soloists,

35:24.589 --> 35:26.751
had to have guts to do it.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.158
He had to have guts to stand in front of the public

35:29.227 --> 35:31.162
and try to silence the room.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.596
People said, "What
A guy with his guitar?".

35:33.732 --> 35:36.668
My name is Pete Krebs,
'm on tour with Elliott Smith.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.967
There was nothing like this guy.

35:40.038 --> 35:44.169
His right hand was doing something very simple.
I could.

35:44.242 --> 35:48.680
But went a perfect music.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.351
Is, we shared the poster
and even to touch your best song,

35:52.417 --> 35:56.149
would say, "Oh, God." Do you understand?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.996
One, two, three, four.

37:27.579 --> 37:32.916
Remember I am fighting for journalists and editors to hear the disc.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.247
Dirty.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.982
I was frowned on to record with your name.

37:38.022 --> 37:41.925
They were used to hearing loud rock and roll
and politician us

37:41.993 --> 37:44.986
and send them this calm solo disc.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.328
And we could not make Io taken seriously.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.094
We made these

38:22.167 --> 38:28.129
first shows, where there were 10 or 15 guys,

38:28.206 --> 38:31.472
sitting, listening to Elliott playing acoustic
,

38:31.576 --> 38:33.101
and it was amazing.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.055
Portland loved Elliott Smith.

38:47.859 --> 38:51.626
It was SoundScan showing how many records were sold.

38:51.696 --> 38:54.894
It divided the country into geographic regions

38:54.966 --> 38:57.299
and showed how many discs sold by area.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.098
This is before discharge.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.266
It is how many people entered the store and bought the disc
.

39:04.442 --> 39:08.004
Half or 70%

39:08.112 --> 39:11.879
Sales of CD
Elliott in the first year were in the Portland area.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.746
He was a star in Portland,

39:13.818 --> 39:16.754
while the rest of the country was indifferent.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.931
With the first album,
it was not easy.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.529
Nationally, it was a struggle.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.838
But Portland Io worshiped.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.401
And they knew that it was magical.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.811
The less Io think, the happier I am.

39:44.883 --> 39:50.823
I do not care if I fit,
or if I fit in somewhere.

39:50.889 --> 39:55.054
I just like music. That's what matters.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.762
Is not complicated.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.298
John Doe Io led tour.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.300
Boys Beastie Boys
spoke of his album.

40:02.367 --> 40:05.531
She toured with Mary Lou Lord.
Attracted artists.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.106
Other artists Elliott discovered before.

40:08.172 --> 40:11.506
And other artists showed their music

40:11.576 --> 40:13.841
reporters and fans.

40:22.353 --> 40:26.791
Margaret had sent me the song and said:

40:26.858 --> 40:28.793
"We seek a video".

40:29.160 --> 40:32.619
I got the number of the study

40:32.697 --> 40:36.190
in which Elliott had recorded much
in Portland.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.361
I think I had to call
three or four times,

40:38.436 --> 40:41.497
and said, "No. Elliott is
Stop calling here.".

40:41.940 --> 40:45.104
And finally, the fourth time I called they said:
"Yes, he's here."

40:45.209 --> 40:47.235
I went and talked with Elliott.

40:47.312 --> 40:50.441
E
immediately when I heard the first words out of his mouth,

40:50.515 --> 40:55.852
thought, "This guy does not want attention."

40:55.920 --> 41:01.086
Only I said, "My name is Ross,
live in Southern California,

41:01.225 --> 41:03.558
" and should make a video "

41:03.628 --> 41:05.290
And he said." Great.

41:05.363 --> 41:08.561
"
But I do not want to do a video in Los Angeles

41:08.633 --> 41:10.192
" and make a video of that place "

41:10.268 --> 41:14.433
And I said." I do not live in Los Angeles.
I live about an hour north of there.

41:14.505 --> 41:16.770
"If you come and you make a video with me,

41:16.841 --> 41:18.935
" I'll pick you up at LAX,

41:19.010 --> 41:21.946
"We'll go to my house in the country,

41:22.013 --> 41:24.881
" and not have to go to LA. "

41:25.083 --> 41:26.346
Y He said: "Great. I will go "

41:33.458 --> 41:37.828
came and stayed with me a week
week and a half, almost two

41:37.895 --> 41:42.060
And we shot a little every day

41:42.133 --> 41:44.500
And some day we woke up and he said:...

41:44.569 --> 41:47.403
" Today I do not want to shoot "
And just passed out

42:06.791 --> 42:10.319
Suddenly
a friend appears with a hearse

42:11.162 --> 42:13.495
Y says:..." Look at the car I bought! ".

42:13.564 --> 42:16.363
And we said: "Great
Can you be in the video!?".

42:16.434 --> 42:19.927
Carry the hearse to an empty street,

42:20.004 --> 42:21.734
up the hill.

42:21.806 --> 42:24.435
And I said, "Okay, I want to shoot

42:24.509 --> 42:27.035
." Elliott walking and the car behind.

42:27.111 --> 42:29.945
"The car continues and leads Io very slow."

42:30.014 --> 42:31.209
And he said, "Okay".

42:31.282 --> 42:33.376
We filmed that and half,

42:33.451 --> 42:37.752
suddenly begins to leave steam
and the car breaks

42:37.822 --> 42:41.884
and had to call a
crane to take the car.

42:46.764 --> 42:48.198
It was great to have him here...

42:48.266 --> 42:50.895
was like a human jukebox,

42:50.968 --> 42:53.631
Played songs of the Beatles,

42:53.704 --> 42:56.003
was a good guy to have around.

42:56.074 --> 43:00.535
I remember, at one point,
he wanted to dye his hair.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.408
And we were halfway through the video.

43:03.481 --> 43:06.610
And he wanted his hair was green or violet.

43:26.337 --> 43:30.138
He never found the color I wanted,

43:30.208 --> 43:33.508
and suited me fine because half the video

43:33.578 --> 43:35.740
her hair would be green or something,

43:35.813 --> 43:38.044
Io people do not think much.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.711
Just think it's a legendary writer,

43:40.785 --> 43:45.189
and was a punk kid
he was concerned his appearance

43:45.256 --> 43:51.093
and wanted to make sure his hair purple or
out great for video.

43:54.699 --> 43:56.224
I left the airport.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.362
And as it appeared mysteriously disappeared
.

44:02.006 --> 44:05.306
Is it different working on an album of Heatmiser

44:05.376 --> 44:07.004
in an album of Elliott Smith?

44:08.045 --> 44:10.810
- It is very different.
- Yes?

44:13.017 --> 44:18.513
In part it is it's a band or yourself,

44:21.759 --> 44:24.695
and not everyone sees

44:24.762 --> 44:28.529
Io they hoped to achieve exactly.

44:28.633 --> 44:29.931
When you write songs,

44:30.001 --> 44:33.233
differences that will
Io in the songs of Elliott Smith

44:33.304 --> 44:35.933
Io will be in Heatmiser or...?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.236
- No.
- No?

44:37.308 --> 44:40.938
Used to be very easy,

44:41.012 --> 44:46.246
Because only played acoustic stuff,

44:46.317 --> 44:49.947
Heatmiser and did nothing as well.

44:50.021 --> 44:53.480
Y did not seem like

44:55.359 --> 44:57.453
something the band would.

44:57.528 --> 45:01.363
But then began the band Heatmiser

45:02.833 --> 45:06.292
do not just rock, all the time.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.394
I understand.

45:07.471 --> 45:10.236
For all we got tired of that.

45:10.308 --> 45:11.298
Totally.

45:13.477 --> 45:17.915
And there are many strong rock bands,

45:19.817 --> 45:23.379
and after a while, we wanted
no longer do that.

45:37.034 --> 45:38.798
He could see that beginning to worry

45:38.869 --> 45:43.364
that their songs did not turn out as I wanted in Heatmiser
.

45:44.976 --> 45:51.212
We get money from Virgin
and bought our own team.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.376
- Good.
- We rented a house,

45:53.451 --> 45:55.647
and build a studio there.

45:55.720 --> 46:01.250
Was good to have time to do it, rather than renting
few days,

46:01.392 --> 46:05.921
go, colds and could not play that day.

46:06.797 --> 46:10.165
Mic City Sons,
started working alone in her,

46:10.234 --> 46:13.762
and turned out to be the best way.

46:13.904 --> 46:16.237
And then we brought Rob and Tom

46:16.307 --> 46:18.936
attempt to take control and focus.

46:19.043 --> 46:23.344
Once joined,
I stopped being so involved.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.981
There was tension.

46:26.050 --> 46:27.382
He and Tony no...

46:27.451 --> 46:28.441
Rob Schnapf Engineer / Producer

46:28.519 --> 46:29.919
not agreed.

46:30.921 --> 46:33.982
Was angry and different rooms, were going

46:34.058 --> 46:36.289
and did not speak.

46:36.360 --> 46:40.092
I got tired of that in a moment. Said:

46:40.364 --> 46:42.458
"? Can...

46:43.734 --> 46:45.168
" Can we do something "

46:47.571 --> 46:52.373
As often happens in such situations,
with very talented and creative people,

46:52.443 --> 46:56.312
communication is not Best

47:02.119 --> 47:03.417
few months later,

47:03.554 --> 47:07.582
call me and tell me they want to make a video Heatmiser
,

47:07.658 --> 47:11.595
and Elliott insists that I'm the director.

47:21.872 --> 47:27.709
I remember I had left all night
awake with Elliott

47:27.778 --> 47:29.770
doing voices Plainclothes Man.

47:31.949 --> 47:36.353
And we started around 8:00,
but he did not know how to sing.

47:36.420 --> 47:41.723
We work on it a bit,
stop and talk.

47:41.826 --> 47:44.591
And I was with Elliott, we decided
and Io.

47:45.529 --> 47:49.864
And we stayed up all night
just me and him.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.873
It was a great night...

48:05.950 --> 48:09.079
From the silence of the night.

48:09.153 --> 48:11.679
Nothing happens.

48:13.691 --> 48:17.355
Even Io hear when I hear that song.

48:17.428 --> 48:20.921
That is the memory that brings me.

48:20.998 --> 48:24.992
I started working with them
at the moment

48:26.937 --> 48:30.271
everything was deteriorating.

48:30.341 --> 48:35.109
And people realized that Elliott had to be done solo

48:35.179 --> 48:38.206
And make your own music.

48:38.282 --> 48:42.447
Now I realize that fought hard

48:42.520 --> 48:47.652
because Heatmiser
was not the place he wanted for his songs.

49:11.649 --> 49:14.915
Their songs pass through the process of Heatmiser

49:14.985 --> 49:19.480
meant not to leave
way he wanted.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.992
And fought against it.

49:23.794 --> 49:27.094
I think many people end
doing things you do not want,

49:27.164 --> 49:31.795
because they want to reach a quick,
or somehow reach place.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.503
But it seemed that no legaríamos
anywhere.

49:35.573 --> 49:40.204
No sense doing Io we wanted,

49:40.277 --> 49:45.238
because it was not worth trying to move forward.

49:45.316 --> 49:51.051
You see Elliott
rebel against their own music Heatmiser,

49:51.121 --> 49:53.386
and feel that was a very loud band.

49:53.457 --> 49:55.323
Almost we never talk about this.

49:58.195 --> 50:02.462
There was no way he left the band
100% satisfied, feel

50:02.533 --> 50:04.729
because Neil was his best friend.

50:39.169 --> 50:42.606
May be rare,

50:42.673 --> 50:45.837
when someone writes a song

50:45.910 --> 50:47.879
and really knows how he wants it,

50:47.945 --> 50:53.441
but all strive to be different.

51:06.830 --> 51:09.595
You could tell they wanted.

51:09.667 --> 51:13.866
He passed Io But what about the bands.

51:13.938 --> 51:19.343
No matter Io that are artistic, competition always appears

51:19.877 --> 51:25.009
In their minds, even
artistic endeavors.

51:25.115 --> 51:27.243
And it seemed that this was Io that happened to them.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.412
And it is not true.

51:29.486 --> 51:31.318
They were all very talented,

51:31.388 --> 51:33.414
but as we all noticed now

51:33.490 --> 51:38.793
Elliott had the ability to reach another level,

51:38.862 --> 51:42.230
and had to let him go.

51:44.568 --> 51:47.561
Elliott was already tired of playing music

51:47.638 --> 51:49.937
I did not feel it was his.

51:52.743 --> 51:57.204
Spent 10 of those shows kids

51:57.281 --> 51:59.409
suddenly a crowd.

52:04.488 --> 52:07.356
Remember
high ranks of the moon they were full,

52:07.424 --> 52:11.885
and all seated and silent.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.431
And it was like: "the secret is revealed."

52:16.767 --> 52:19.362
When left Either / Or, he filled...

52:19.436 --> 52:20.529
James Clark guitar technician, XO Tour

52:20.604 --> 52:22.698
The lower part was him and his guitar.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.935
Were 1500-1600 people
and not a fly buzzing.

52:26.810 --> 52:29.143
If you did not realize you were
facing a genius,

52:29.213 --> 52:30.579
you were not paying attention.

52:31.448 --> 52:35.909
I knew Heatmiser,
at least for now, left behind.

52:36.553 --> 52:38.784
- Was completed.
Yes. - It's over?

52:39.256 --> 52:40.349
Right.

52:40.824 --> 52:46.388
The idea is to concentrate on your career and your
solo songs.

52:46.463 --> 52:47.556
- Sure.
- It's okay.

52:48.032 --> 52:50.092
Let other.

52:50.167 --> 52:54.127
And this is the new solo album,

52:54.204 --> 52:57.231
called Either / Or,
the second song of Kill Rock Stars.

52:57.307 --> 53:00.209
It Is Elliott Smith in the study.
's Morning Becomes Eclectic.

54:59.329 --> 55:03.699
When Larry and he founded Jackpot !, released Io think

55:03.767 --> 55:05.326
to concentrate on his music.

55:05.402 --> 55:09.498
Io no longer distracted
work part-time or whatever... Io

55:09.640 --> 55:11.472
Drywall or Io that was then.

55:12.509 --> 55:14.501
I think we both thought

55:14.578 --> 55:17.207
once work together better for them

55:17.281 --> 55:19.716
have their own place,

55:19.783 --> 55:22.309
and I think there came Jackpot !.

55:28.425 --> 55:29.916
I said. "I want to be owner of the place

55:29.993 --> 55:31.962
" I do not want to mess with anybody.

55:32.095 --> 55:35.065
"But I will make a proportional contract if you want to come

55:35.332 --> 55:37.494
" and help build and bring your tools

55:37.568 --> 55:38.763
"to work there."

55:39.203 --> 55:42.970
"We will contract covering
place, rent and others."

55:43.507 --> 55:49.708
He agreed, and I think that was
in late January or February 97

55:49.947 --> 55:52.007
that take the place on 20th Street and Morrison.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.737
Microphone cables are a mess
SORRY!

56:41.732 --> 56:42.893
That song!

56:43.166 --> 56:44.429
That song?

56:45.068 --> 56:46.661
- Yes, that.
- The girl.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.065
Okay.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.665
What?

56:50.007 --> 56:51.031
God!

56:51.108 --> 56:53.009
The the girl.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.169
Does the girl?

57:00.317 --> 57:02.149
Finally, when I heard Either / Or

57:02.286 --> 57:03.754
and saw the picture, I said,

57:03.820 --> 57:08.724
"
That sweet voice comes out of this crazy and intense face?".

57:09.359 --> 57:14.821
Not that she was not pretty, but her face seemed
had been in the war.

57:14.898 --> 57:17.629
It was a cute kid singing
sad and beautiful songs.

57:17.701 --> 57:18.828
Autumn de Wilde Photographer / Director

57:18.936 --> 57:22.168
And that was an important part

57:22.239 --> 57:27.803
Io that trapped people,
it was a common face.

57:27.911 --> 57:30.176
It looked like a regular guy.

57:32.749 --> 57:35.981
Perhaps the most personal song you've written is
Say Yes.

57:36.053 --> 57:40.286
Because we could tell that it was Joanna.

57:40.390 --> 57:44.589
Is...

57:44.962 --> 57:46.225
She is amazing.

57:51.902 --> 57:55.930
If songs were treated me, he told me
.

57:56.006 --> 57:58.532
He said: "This is about you
This is about us.".

57:58.809 --> 58:01.472
And that will reach many people.

58:01.545 --> 58:05.175
It is very real.

58:05.649 --> 58:08.744
But that's just out of his life.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.791
She was a great influence on him

58:22.933 --> 58:26.995
in the classical period of Elliott.

58:27.104 --> 58:31.667
His musical talent,
his knowledge, his relationship

58:31.742 --> 58:34.803
is undeniable that she had enormous impact.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.248
Say Yes is beautiful.

58:39.950 --> 58:46.083
I wish the circumstances that became known to be more ideal.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.328
I knew you talked about moving to New York.

58:51.428 --> 58:52.953
- That's right.
- Yes?

58:53.663 --> 58:57.794
Why?
Because there is more access to culture?

58:58.735 --> 59:02.228
I do not know. I have spent time in Portland.

59:04.007 --> 59:05.566
And I lost my band.

59:06.810 --> 59:10.076
And do not go out with my girlfriend.

59:11.248 --> 59:12.773
- So...
- Just...

59:12.849 --> 59:15.717
- Time to go.
- I'm grieving.

59:17.421 --> 59:18.912
I'll feel better in a moment.

59:19.923 --> 59:22.722
Elliott had moved to New York
to get away from that.

59:22.793 --> 59:28.096
The idea of living in Brooklyn was anonymous

59:28.198 --> 59:31.635
that offered, compared
with the experience I had in Portland,

59:31.701 --> 59:33.966
especially the last year he was here.

59:39.976 --> 59:42.775
It was at the time when he became

59:42.879 --> 59:44.438
in a publicly known person.

59:44.514 --> 59:45.607
Writer John Chandler, Magazine "The Rocket"

59:45.715 --> 59:48.241
Elliott, then,
was signed with a company

59:48.318 --> 59:51.755
and gradually became known

59:51.822 --> 59:53.450
regarding the influence he had.

59:53.623 --> 59:57.253
Things had settled,
he had been given power to progress,

59:57.327 --> 01:00:00.126
He needed to escape.
I needed to get out of here.

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:05.227
He moved to New York, was crazy
because he left a large void in Portland.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.737
Many people missed his presence.

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:11.363
I was very sad not to have him around.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.373
We feel that something representative

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.413
better Io Portland he went.

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:23.882
Time he arrived in New York, people knew
Io.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.321
Already had success.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.152
And all Io Good Will Hunting

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.692
it was when he was in New York.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:33.194
By then, it was one of their advertisers,

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:37.633
we were in touch all the time, because he was arming
interviews

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:41.570
Io called home,
and made appointments with the press and things for him.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.665
He appeared with a bag and a guitar.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:59.555
I remember how surprised I could walk
home

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.851
with a handbag.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.730
Gradually, the world took Io.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.433
Going down the street looking for a cab

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.877
and saw someone get out of one,
he was Elliott and said:

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.448
"Great Want a drink with me!?".

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:30.116
When he came to Portland,
he found a pair of bars

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.486
he liked.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:33.713
Y Luna was one of them.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:34.847
Owner Rob Sacher Luna Lounge, New York

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:40.020
I saw it every night at the bar,
writing a diary.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:44.556
Thought I was a writer,
I never imagined I was a musician.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.867
I followed him and went to another bar,
a Polish bar.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.672
We went in and had a couple of old
and a jukebox,

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:56.440
approaches the jukebox and puts $ 40.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.875
And I was very impressed.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.850
I had never been with anyone who decides

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:03.648
control music from a jukebox.

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:08.056
That was one of my favorites
to be your friend.

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.661
Should know more of who he is,

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.224
plus it was someone
who spoke at the bar.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.749
Then I learned working on the album XO
.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:51.527
Remember we recorded Waltz # 1

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.595
demo version that,
called "Bushmills" digital tape,

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.937
that surely had to do with last night
.

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.267
We spent four hours recording it.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:04.303
Letter and then you put...

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.440
You look outside and listen to this song

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:09.145
loose with the sound of piano and others.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.720
And he said, "Make a mixture, and we drink."

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:14.017
When Elliott touched us...

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.422
Owner Mark Flanagan, Club Largo

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:18.326
God! Yes. That crazy waltz.

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:21.895
What Io played and played and said:
"I have no words, but..."

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.163
- And was like, "God!".
- No, I was crazy.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.861
There were a couple of times

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.027
Jon Brion Musician, Composer, Producer

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.471
that freaked me as a musician.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:39.677
Important thing to pay attention to their lyrics

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.314
is not always about him.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.014
There are character studies.

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:48.453
And Io another to pay attention is often

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:52.519
when seems to get on stage,
uses many archetypes.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.963
Elliott wrote songs
drug addicts in the city.

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.261
I knew nothing about heroin.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.494
Io wrote songs that I saw in Portland.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.935
No
always touched on it in his songs.

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:17.943
There's enough of your daily there.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:21.458
For you feel is real,
and takes half

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:24.719
and Io gives you so that you adueñes

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.195
what occurs in your life.

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.778
Elliott Io is better here.

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:53.984
The balance between being a production studio
a raw,

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.323
and yet incredibly beautiful
emotionally intimate.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:02.364
For me it is the pinnacle of his solo material.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:11.605
Are songs.
Is not supposed to be a newspaper, or a speech.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:16.645
Pictures are made with words.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:29.024
There is no doubt that, at some point,

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.924
itself drugged,

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:33.623
but used drug references

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:37.723
for years before drugs.

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:47.505
I see many things from the window of a car,

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.910
but not all places are different,

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.248
not that you can not tell
how are the places.

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:02.886
I was on the road and did not care.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.359
He drank a lot.

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:09.828
And calling in the middle of the night, almost every night
, very sad.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.404
And Io doing for weeks,

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.441
and did not know what to do.

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:21.911
She was scared.
Was a child, I was 21 or 22 years.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.643
I did not know how to help someone

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:28.412
overcome such a bad thing.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:34.190
I woke up one morning after a night
of those, and I had sent an email.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:38.690
"Please, you never angry with me,
if I do something.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.154
" Promise me you will never get angry with me
'

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:46.498
I knew I could not improve on this.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.868
Had sounded all alarms .

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:53.669
And all the people who worked for him at the time

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:57.042
Io had been alerted happened

01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.476
And the decision was made

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:02.144
That would be an intervention

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.520
and that would a lot of people.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:10.691
But after that intervention,
songs got intense.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.491
Was still angry, but with us
,

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:18.399
his friends suddenly
instead of being angry at something else.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:23.363
She began writing songs about
us as: "I am angry with you."

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:27.304
I was afraid that did not relate to anyone

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:30.874
and die faster.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:13.883
My next guest tonight is here
to touch his Oscar nominated song

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.087
soundtrack of Good Will Hunting.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.925
Please applause for Elliott Smith.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:45.819
And I stayed behind Elliott, looking
how it looked on television play

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.582
on the Conan O'Brien show.

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:52.225
He had an intensity that was obvious,

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:57.029
as intense as if I touched it,

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.102
on that stool on television.

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:00.995
And in that moment, I realized

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:03.163
that Elliott would be a star.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:26.586
Miss Misery's what I did strangest

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.220
as a recording engineer.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:32.768
One day, Gus got when I was not
and played for him,

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.430
Then
did as he had written for the film

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.566
to be nominated, and then Io
achieved.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.166
And we say,

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.469
"What?"

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:43.474
"You're competing for an Oscar What?".

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.647
Was a validation of Io we knew Elliott.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.843
That was great.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.749
It was the night before it hit
face of all this shit,

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.756
and I said. "Do it'll be fine."

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.622
And I thought, "God, nor would Io".

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.421
Elliott's friends did
parties to see it.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:01.765
I went to the Oscars with him.

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:05.398
On the day of the Oscars, they said

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:10.439
"If you do not want to walk down the red carpet,

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:12.304
" you can enter the back "

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.240
I said." Let's walk down the red carpet
".

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:17.041
you were trying not we walk down the red carpet

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.973
ended up walking the red carpet behind Madonna

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.212
We were not filmed

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:27.048
Celine Dion said...
"Are you nervous? Io're not. "

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:33.791
Yes, and I was But Io said yes
Io to tell me he wanted

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:39.792
Was the first time that many people
outside their closed circle

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.666
occurred Io has happened.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:47.173
It was a rare situation,

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:50.577
and it was very rewarding to see it.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:52.575
It was good for music.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:57.483
"You" to all means "win".

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:01.751
All the music that we liked.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.486
PROFILE SKY-ROCKETS ELLIOTT SMITH

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.551
You did. We won.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:11.462
The funny thing is made
my friends and my mother happy.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.836
Made
was easier for her to say what I did.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.142
It happened so fast.

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:24.374
Good Will Hunting What happened
and then Oscar,

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.439
and signed with DreamWorks

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:29.682
within months.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:35.184
Was a good time to make the video with Elliott

01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:40.219
because although people looked like Io:

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.356
"She does not mind the praise" and others.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:45.560
He was very happy

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.195
having been nominated for an Academy Award.

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:49.899
I was confident.

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:53.873
Wine, appeared on set with that white suit, there appeared

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:57.903
and said, "Let the video, this is great I
I have.".

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.115
If you are wondering:
"What do you do with your life?".

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:06.451
He said: "Writing songs, recording them."

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:11.560
I once said: "I like to write, record.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.259
"I would do the tours and interviews

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.356
to write and record".

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:19.401
And I said: "I understand."

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:37.011
The XO tour started in 98. There
started working for him.

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:40.352
We turned the world
twice in six months.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.455
With the tour of this disc.

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:58.097
The first day of tour, appeared
a hat on.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:12:59.369
Paul Pulvirenti Musician, XO Tour

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:00.671
WHY I command

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:09.611
The tour was fun.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:13.383
We were like one big happy family.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.317
A Elliott liked me

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.429
out before him and photograph people.

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.157
Los her smile or something.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:23.960
He liked that to have a memory.

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:31.633
Wherever we went, people stopped us

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:36.042
and opened their mouths.
He said: "It Elliott Smith".

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:55.258
And we'd say:
"This will be a week of mustache

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:59.029
." We'll see who can grow the best mustache
in a week "

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:02.865
And Elliott was the last to join
said.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.202
"I will not let you grow a mustache."

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.045
Elliott was very happy with this show.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.581
First, because we were in Ireland

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.512
and also because Elvis Costello
would come that night.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:19.749
And Elliott is a fan of Elvis.

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:33.102
My name Coby. I am the sound.

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:35.700
I like that.

01:14:36.372 --> 01:14:38.307
Mira. I am the type of sound.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.515
The same in Australia.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.017
In Australia we played a huge place.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:52.988
It was very well received there.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.724
It was a good time.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:10.405
I can not. I can not do this song.
I touch many times.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.506
The
played hundreds of times and I got tired of it.

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:16.409
And I can not touch it. I'm sorry.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.812
- No, okay.
- Maybe there's another piece...

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:21.407
you finished the Waltz No. 2 very abruptly.

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:23.578
You said: "The played many times."

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.916
I had to stop because...

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:33.259
What sense does a song playing poorly?

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:37.425
It's best to play well

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.063
touch only because.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:46.704
When dropped from that tour,
he came to Los Angeles to work in Figure 8.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:50.012
There
met and started dating a lot.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:56.445
Felt much pressure XO tour

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.511
to be better known.

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:00.847
Y
tried to understand how to deal with that pressure.

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:01.913
Alyssa Siegel Assistant Margaret Mittleman

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:05.119
And his representative, Margaret, he was here.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:08.426
We think, "Okay, come here
Come be with us.".

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:17.266
It was time to go. It was no good.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.875
When he moved to Los Angeles,
people said:

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.272
"You see Elliott Smith".

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.810
"It will play at the Silverlake Lounge".
O "has..."

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.410
Everybody talked about that.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.643
Everyone knew he was there.

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:30.753
Always said... "I'll be here a few months

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.516
" I'll only be here a few months "

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.994
When he went to Los Angeles, always explained

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:40.689
it was a temporary situation

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.966
Most of these people are
people with whom I worked.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.406
Touching on his records,
producing their records,

01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:53.909
We have written songs together.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:57.013
Speaking of the best people in the world,
Elliott Smith.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.909
Long was a great club in Fairfax.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:05.010
Largo, at that time, was well known for having very good
songwriters.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.713
It was a very small place,

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.725
where Jon played with 120 people.

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:14.363
There was a stage and a piano,
the other side was a bar,

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.693
and very cute.

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.790
Perhaps too much.
I did not want to play there

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.462
because he said: "It's too cute place."

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:22.471
And I said, "Why has tablecloths?".

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:25.769
Elliott got used to go there
Friday night

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:30.040
and hang out there and sometimes up

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:32.172
and doing something with Jon on stage.

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.683
Jon  The atmosphere created in Largo

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:38.311
Io was something that did grow wise...

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.547
The boy came out.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:46.126
The first time I played at Largo
Elliott was crazy.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.726
People used to talk while he played,

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:52.893
in bars, or where touched in the country,

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:57.666
Io output,
sat and played.

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:00.766
He played a song that was beautiful,
and everyone said:

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.368
"God, this guy is great."

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:07.275
Everyone applauded and then sat
one minutes

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:12.083
and said: "They should talk
I are getting very nervous.".

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:15.747
Was more than a place to put on shows,

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:20.387
because he felt comfortable
with Flanagan and Jon Brion.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.656
I was not comfortable with many people.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.132
Things were not easy in New York.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.605
It was not always easy to be friends with him

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:34.440
when he was not well,

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.741
but it became more difficult
when he moved here.

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:46.347
It was so prolific during that time that every time
Io watched

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.153
He said: "You want to hear new songs?".

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.716
And say, "Yeah, right".

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.022
And played three to five new songs.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.094
No Io had seen in weeks,

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:59.294
this period is a golden period
to its composition.

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:06.304
That wall has a long history:

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:07.903
"What were they thinking?".

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:11.607
And then: "It's the ugliest
mural I've seen in my life."

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.650
And over the years:
"That mural is the most fantastic

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:16.208
" I've seen in my life "

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:21.950
And I think I expected to put on something..

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:24.656
And I said, "Is there something you

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:27.993
" expected do with Io
you want to experience?

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:31.898
"Because we can experience
and discard if we do not like".

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.725
And he said: "Yes, everyone thinks

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:37.102
" I want to be in a dark room with dark furniture

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.664
"light and dark depressing".

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:50.818
Brought some Polaroids he had taken
of murals in Sunset

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:56.723
and rare stained glass and said:
"And if you're like everyone sees you

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:01.321
" and do not realize that the world
color explodes behind you "

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.765
had no means at that time

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:07.859
The Quiet Man

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:11.099
To bring strangers and...

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:14.172
heard one of his songs
and relate to it,

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:16.712
have an emotional reaction and attachment to it,

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:18.771
then approach him and cast him .

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:22.284
It was... It was a quiet and humble guy.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:25.321
It was... I felt the need to care for them.

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:29.591
I could not sympathize with them

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.456
because it would have been very overwhelming

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:34.292
but always said:
"Thank you, thank you very much".

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.855
And Io meant.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.065
Valued everyone who took the time to listen
album.

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:52.643
It was very easy to talk intimately with Elliott,

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:54.707
And he struggled with that.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:59.386
All his life could be very intimate
very fast with people

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:03.859
that after a night like this,
Io were people who did not let go.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:08.527
I think many people
which is really composer,

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:11.692
and not entertaining, fight it.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.060
John Lennon was asked: "Why
what your songs are about love?"

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.201
And he said:. ". Love is the world's largest
Io

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.638
" About what else would sing "

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:24.403
According to him, all his songs are...
His songs are like also

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.020
We all have to take turns.

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:36.718
Can not be your best friend, all the time
forever.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.395
Almost everyone wants to work
being a singer / songwriter

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:50.405
because they believe it will entitle
a certain kind of attention.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:56.673
Y can see composers geniuses

01:21:57.112 --> 01:22:00.708
as Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan
, and say:

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:05.248
"Damn I just have to learn me these two chords

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:09.488
.." And if I put words well, and
I stand right in front of people,

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.428
"I give all the prizes."

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.961
His work was great on all levels.

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:21.728
Yes!

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.831
Paul Thomas Anderson,

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:27.342
after Magnolia and others,

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:30.504
Decided to film something but in a more simple way

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:31.842
with a fixed camera.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.088
Elliott appeared that day and spent more,

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:44.785
and was a little more...

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.260
It was the beginning of the end.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:47.886
Drugs were involved in that.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:01.507
Passed songs,
and were not great, so...

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.375
But anyway, that was...

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:08.179
Cameras things change, and for musicians
,

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.889
notifies you that you have one watching you microscope.

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:20.787
I remember I left a message on my answering
.

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:22.998
A few days after September 11,

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:27.594
And had not heard from him for over a
year

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.336
he said: "I hope you are well

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:33.708
." And I'm sorry that you did not know me.

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.538
"I'm not well, but I hope you do,
and that everyone is safe."

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:53.725
It was a horrible moment, in the world
and where I lived.

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:59.200
But it was the greatest relief to hear that.

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:05.807
I know that was when I was heavily drugged.

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:18.118
It was not a stupid fantasy rock,

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:21.387
associated with drugs.

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:23.959
I think that there were times that,

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:28.258
was also
Io smart enough to know when to get up.

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:36.264
I started to distance myself from him

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:38.307
because it got rough.

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:42.706
I did not want to be a facilitator.

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:56.250
Was tough for him, he was not himself.

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.360
Not like always... I do not know, it was crazy.

01:25:00.062 --> 01:25:02.725
I was bad, and quit.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.262
Why is not finished,

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:07.633
because never talk back.

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:11.800
He forgot the letter and started again
songs and apologized.

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:17.070
He cuts his set,
and people did not understand what happened.

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:21.750
It was very devastating to see his talent and music to go with it.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.882
Signs all addict, right?

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:32.761
All around you begins to disappear.

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:47.204
Then was that...
After that he decided

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.135
try to get better.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:02.015
We reconnect, and it was interesting

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:06.152
because I said, "Go
is working on new things

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:10.495
!" And seems to come to fruition.

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:17.130
"Maybe we can work together again
and continue as friends."

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.874
I called from time to time.

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:25.570
And limamos rough,

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:28.845
and tried to compose himself.

01:26:32.254 --> 01:26:35.986
Broadway was driving by and saw Io sitting outside Starbucks

01:26:36.058 --> 01:26:39.756
and felt that enough time had passed.

01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:41.592
Seeing him sitting alone,

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.427
I parked and walked

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.995
and told him I was proud of him.

01:26:47.069 --> 01:26:51.063
We never re-established a close friendship,

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.764
but we saw a few times after that,

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:55.436
and things were fine,
really appreciate that.

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:01.981
He did a show at Crystal Ballroom,

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:07.253
and all went backstage,

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.950
and said, "Elliott want to talk."

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:12.483
He said, "About what?".
And I said, "I worry a lot".

01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:16.592
It did not look good. And it seemed very...

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.934
When you see a friend

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:23.129
and seems to have become an old
from one day to the other,

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.174
And he was very fragile.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.372
We knew

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:31.675
the person we wanted was not there.

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:45.293
I hugged him and I
returned the hug and said, "I love you".

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:47.357
And he said, "Me too."

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:53.763
And that was the last time you saw Io.

01:27:57.172 --> 01:28:00.267
I think Sam
Io said it best in a song by Quasi.

01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:04.575
"Do not hurt the ones you love, you hurt
those who love you."

01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:12.645
One night we were in Largo,

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:15.486
and he said, "Charlie sent me a letter."

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:26.334
Was a letter from my father
who had written to Elliott and said:

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:32.238
"
I've had time to think about parenting,

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:36.402
" and I realize that I was
the best father to you and I 'm sorry. "

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.946
And remember Io Elliott took to heart.

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:53.085
But it allowed him to close the stage and I think Elliott
Io thanked

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:56.427
And I think that helped.

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:41.057
Elliot Smith died two stab wounds to the chest.

01:31:41.129 --> 01:31:44.327
Except for prescription drugs in normal levels ,

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:46.834
no drugs were found on his body

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:51.264
The coroner could not confirm
if the wound was self-inflicted.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:54.173
The report remains undetermined.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:14.121
Basement On The Hill...

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:19.063
It is a beautiful music.

01:32:19.167 --> 01:32:20.965
Subías the volume of a channel...

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.035
you heard him say:

01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:27.670
"OK".

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.739
And then you heard...

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.406
And it was like I was alive again.

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.947
It was sublime, as it is there.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.287
Is there, like the air conditioner or refrigerator
resonates it makes noises.

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:44.485
Does not give you account

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:49.962
until it is so quiet.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:54.432
There was nothing sadder for me
the songs she had not sung,

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.027
where the melody is heard.

01:32:56.905 --> 01:33:00.239
And the voices are not,
and will always be silent.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.746
Shon  "Goldenboy" Sullivan
Musician, Gira Figure 8

01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:13.448
felt that the complexity of who he was
faded when he died.

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:16.189
Because people wanted an easy way to understand.

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:17.448
ART FILLS THE VOID!

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:20.084
This is one of those artists

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:25.099
that future generations will discover and rediscover their music
,

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:28.634
and will have a lasting legacy.

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:32.504
He gave us the words we could not find
when we were sad.

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:37.176
And there was much

01:33:37.245 --> 01:33:41.945
to occupy any time, any relationship,

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:46.987
And that always makes something alive beyond you.

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:51.684
Do not understand how special
the opportunity they gave you,

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:56.261
able to make art with someone as talented

01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:58.857
and so important.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.101
And only years later, I heard his music

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:06.608
and say, "My God was this!".

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:11.440
Hopefully, we can one day overcome
drama,

01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:15.314
can overcome the sensational news of his life.

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:19.515
And start focusing on Io that you created.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.052
It would break her heart if she knew...

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:27.653
Let people discover
Io and think that is very sad

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:33.031
Because it was only a small part of
who he really was.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:41.565
I not say this about many artists.
Io Buying all you have done.

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:43.238
Because everything is good.

01:34:43.311 --> 01:34:47.078
Worth everything you hear
Io who brought in his life.

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:53.044
No wonder people keep discovering and sits
moved.

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:58.719
Because I believe that at its best,
is a very emotional and captivating music.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:03.828
I feel privileged to have seen

01:35:04.132 --> 01:35:07.830
and I had the open mind to know

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.164
I was facing a real artist.

01:35:11.406 --> 01:35:15.468
When we played on stage,

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:20.743
Sometimes he looked at me and I smiled.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:23.846
I got that look

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:29.619
recorded in memory and sometimes sleep with her.

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:33.684
I have dreams of him smiling.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:38.128
Is someone else now.

01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:45.267
Y had no opportunity
things were not ideal for him

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.777
in the body of Elliott Smith.

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:54.313
Y needed another back with a new...

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:59.185
With a new look, a new existence
.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:03.249
And perhaps something to tell me
myself to feel better,

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:07.261
but it feels real,
so I'm happy for him.

01:36:13.668 --> 01:36:15.296
We have another here.

01:36:15.403 --> 01:36:18.066
I think this will be the closing song.

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:20.732
You chose to close this album
for some reason?

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.641
Because I was happy.

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:27.607
- Has a positive name, right? .
- Yes

01:36:28.316 --> 01:36:33.482
We Elliott Smith in the studio,
's Morning Becomes Eclectic on KCRW 89.9.

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:42.225
In August of 2013, friends and family made shows to benefit

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:46.166
to celebrate the life and music of Elliott Smith
.

01:36:46.334 --> 01:36:50.066
Would have turned 44 years.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.663
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to No Name # 1

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:54.800
a tribute to the life and music of the great Elliott Smith
.

01:38:54.950 --> 01:39:12.181
... That all I want now,
is happiness for you and for me...

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.181
One Two.. Three.

01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:29.181
Ripped by Ricardo for fans of Steven inches Hispanic. ;)
