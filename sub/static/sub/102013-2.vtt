00:19.060 --> 00:20.895
NANCY:
Excuse me, Hannah?

00:20.937 --> 00:23.356
Your assistant Aristotle said
we could find you here.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.192
And while we would have waited
until 10:00 a.m. Eastern,

00:26.234 --> 00:27.694
the Aglaeca just sent
us a crazy vision

00:27.736 --> 00:28.987
of how she's going
to murder us.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.114
So, hi.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.036
So our theory is that the
Aglaeca was a real living person

00:36.077 --> 00:39.748
before she died and somehow
her life story is hidden

00:39.789 --> 00:43.001
in a sea shanty that
this mirror talks about.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.295
And if the sea shanty helps us
learn about who she was

00:45.336 --> 00:46.629
and how she met her end,

00:46.671 --> 00:48.339
we can figure out
her unfinished business.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.425
The thinking being,
if we fix her problems,

00:50.467 --> 00:51.468
she'll move on.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.678
Well, it's worked for us before.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.222
Right?
God, I'm so tired.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.058
We haven't slept for,
like, 36 hours.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.684
Yeah, well, at least
you have a place to sleep.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.311
Victoria kicked me out.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.562
Hey, you can stay with me.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.940
Carson moved into his loft.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.817
You should totally
stay with Nancy.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.737
That's a great idea.
Did the archives
bring anything up?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.655
Yes. There's an entry
in my ledger

01:12.697 --> 01:14.324
for an old sailor's song

01:14.365 --> 01:17.243
written by an unknown author
in the 1800s.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.120
Oh, it says the lyrics are
the only account

01:19.162 --> 01:20.830
of the Aglaeca's death.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.416
HANNAH:
In 1949, the Maine
Composers' Project

01:23.458 --> 01:24.876
did a single recording.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.128
A 45 vinyl record.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.673
HANNAH:
The Historical Society
had it until 1975,

01:30.715 --> 01:32.342
but then someone
took it out on loan

01:32.383 --> 01:34.177
and never returned it.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.930
It says the borrower's name
is Mac.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.640
There's an address, so that's
some place to start.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.850
What, you think
he still has the recording?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.477
He better.
That's the only way

01:42.519 --> 01:43.770
we can find out
how the Aglaeca died.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.730
And then we set
her spirit free

01:45.772 --> 01:47.565
and save ourselves
from a fatal curse.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.734
Great, brilliant.
Come on, let's go.

Maybe Mac lives in a bar.

Um, excuse me, we're looking
for an older gentleman,

03:25.288 --> 03:27.207

All that's left of him

03:35.590 --> 03:38.551
is his lucky flask
and unpaid bar tab.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.970
He's dead. Of course.

How are we gonna find
the missing record

if we can't ask Mac
where he put it?

03:45.016 --> 03:46.434
What if we do ask him?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.853
I mean, ghosts are, you know,
attracted to their

03:48.895 --> 03:50.188

03:53.358 --> 03:54.692
No way.

valuable deterrent

customers.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.197
What if we settle Mac's tab?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.866
Well, that's interesting.
ACE: You got ten bucks?

Oh, it's so good to see you.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.788
Um, welcome to The Claw.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.457
Sweetheart, I know
it's a surprise.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.918
Oh, no, you-you and Dad
are always welcome.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.462
Just me this trip.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.922
Your father and I
were pretty shocked

04:57.964 --> 04:59.549
when you bought this place.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.759
But I suppose when someone
bequeaths you

05:01.801 --> 05:03.803
this kind of guilt money,
the impulse is to

05:03.845 --> 05:05.346
spend it on something big.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.307
At least it wasn't a boat.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.975
Well, it's actually been
a really good return

05:09.017 --> 05:11.686
on investment already.
Still,

05:11.728 --> 05:14.397
when are you coming home?
You belong in Florida.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.941
Here we go.
Tone.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
Yes, ma'am.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.611
You lost two years
of your life here

05:20.653 --> 05:23.448
for defending yourself
against a violent drunk.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.824
Just because some
rich white lady

05:24.866 --> 05:27.076
didn't see him trying
to kill you.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.120
Why would you want
to stay in Maine?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.248
GEORGE:
Can you believe this?
Some birdbrain tourist

05:32.290 --> 05:33.791
almost drove right into me.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.462
Uh, Mom, this is George Fan,

05:37.503 --> 05:40.923
and we are dating.

05:41.841 --> 05:46.637
Wa-Was it a blue SUV
coming from the mini mart?

Oh, God.

Millicent Nickerson.

"Birdbrain tourist" is fine.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.022

I hope you didn't
injure your hand

05:57.190 --> 05:58.316

05:59.901 --> 06:01.778
She punched the trunk.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.908

she was smiling ♪

06:06.949 --> 06:10.370

record shop in four towns

06:19.712 --> 06:23.633

45s from the '70s.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.927
Look at that.
More Gordon Lightfoot.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.470
Great.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.722
Did you have any luck
at the town registrar?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.183
I found Mac's arrest record

06:32.225 --> 06:34.727
from 1973

06:34.769 --> 06:37.522
and his death certificate
from 1975.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.066
So that could be something
to go off of.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.571
You look like you just
returned from war.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.200
Yeah. I just checked my mom
into the Ebb Tide Inn.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.202
Your mom is here?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.662
You have a mom?

06:52.703 --> 06:54.288
Yeah, yeah, a mom who wants me

06:54.330 --> 06:56.207
to move back to Miami Gardens.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.750
NANCY:
Got to love parents.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.877
You need us to run interference?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.046
What I need is
a good night's sleep.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.049
I second that.
Okay, good night.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.968
Good night.
Bye.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.434
Hopefully it'll make the couch
a little more comfortable.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.020
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.731
If we survive this, I owe you.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.651
Ah. Just a pillow
and a blanket.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.446
Friends don't let friends
get cold.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.990
Yeah.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.825
Guess we, um...

07:30.867 --> 07:33.703
we skipped the friend part
the first time around.

07:33.744 --> 07:34.996
Yeah, I think we skipped over
a lot of things

07:35.037 --> 07:37.623
the first time around.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.378
Good night.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.174
Night.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.188
(clattering)

08:20.458 --> 08:23.252

Hey, buddy.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.763

09:12.927 --> 09:16.430
Hey, what happened
to your wrists?

09:16.472 --> 09:18.891
Huh.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.394
I must have hit 'em
on something.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.772
Here's the crazy thing.
(chuckles)

09:24.814 --> 09:26.649
You've narrowed it down
to one thing?

09:26.691 --> 09:29.819
I've seen that guy before.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.363
Yeah, at-at Diana Marvin's
party.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.199
Hey, buddy, can you
get me a drink?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.536
I just thought he was
another rude Marvin...
BESS: Eh?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.204
...uh, no offense, Bess--

09:40.246 --> 09:42.331
mistaking me for a waiter.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.166
And he said the exact
same thing then.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.711
"Hey, buddy, can you
get me a drink?"

09:49.797 --> 09:51.132
Hang with me.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.718
What if our uninvited guest

09:53.759 --> 09:56.512
was not so uninvited?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.431
NICK:
John MacDonald. 1975.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.016
Yeah, that's him.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.893
Next time he appears to you,

10:02.935 --> 10:04.687
why don't you just play along
a little bit?

10:04.729 --> 10:05.771
See if you can get him
to tell you

10:05.813 --> 10:06.814
where he hid the 45.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.026
Okay, I would love to help,

10:10.067 --> 10:12.695
but I'm supposed to meet
my mom for breakfast

10:12.737 --> 10:14.530
at the seriously
understaffed Claw.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.366
And since Ace is on
a leave of absence

10:17.408 --> 10:20.953
as a way to avoid death
by freezer,

10:20.995 --> 10:23.831
I really need someone
to actually work.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.541
No. Not it.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.252
Bess...

10:30.087 --> 10:32.089
Fine.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.550
But I'm not doing dishes.
I just got a fresh manicure.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.429
I'm not dying with gross nails.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.764
No.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.976
Hey.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.478
Hey.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.313
Need a, need a hand?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.148
No, I'm good.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.692
Guy at the store said
it was a one-man job.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.446
Mr. D., I think the guy
at the store lied to you.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.323
(laughs softly)
Let's do this.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.741
Thank you.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.327
(straining):
Thank you.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.580
All right.
Right back here would be great.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.293
(exhales)
I appreciate your help.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.253
Hey, can I get you
something to drink?

11:12.463 --> 11:16.634
I can offer you water...

11:16.676 --> 11:18.302
or water.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.846
I'm good. I should
probably get going, though.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
Hey, listen.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.021
I'm guessing Nancy's filled
you guys in on everything,

11:29.063 --> 11:32.900
and I'm, I'm really glad she's
got friends she can lean on.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.570
I just want to know...
is she okay?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.658
Yeah. I think it's been tough,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.827
but, you know,
so is Nancy, so...

11:42.868 --> 11:45.329
Would you make sure
she's eating?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.789
Whenever she's got a lot
going on in her life,

11:46.831 --> 11:48.874
stress, she forgets to eat.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.210
Looks like that runs
in the family.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.338
(chuckles):
Yeah...

11:58.759 --> 12:00.386
GEORGE:
(sighs) She thinks
I'm a raging lunatic.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.388
No, she doesn't.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.516
It's just because she's only
seen that side to you...

12:05.558 --> 12:09.019
which doesn't exist
in the real world.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.400
NICK:
I know it's not from
Florida oranges.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.236
(laughs softly)
But I also know

12:17.278 --> 12:19.530
that you didn't come here
for the citrus.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.742
Want to know why I'm here?

12:22.783 --> 12:24.952
Remember Sheila from church?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.580
Her son Eddie was killed
two weeks ago in Orlando.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.333
Wait, Eddie Davis?
Mm-hmm.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.586
He played JV
when I was on varsity. Wh--

12:33.627 --> 12:35.421
Uh, wh-what happened?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.965
Shot dead in a park.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.551
Police said it was a drug deal
gone wrong,

12:40.593 --> 12:42.261
but that boy wasn't into drugs.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.890
Sheila thinks it was
a case of mistaken identity.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.475
That poor family.

12:47.516 --> 12:52.772
I left the funeral
and booked my flight to see you.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.319
Look, I am really sorry
about Eddie.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.362
But that's not
gonna happen to me.

13:00.404 --> 13:03.073
That's what I thought
two years ago.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.576
Hey, my situation
was totally different.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.411
There was no way to know...

13:07.453 --> 13:08.996
But we should have known.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.207
Your father and I spent
your entire life

13:11.248 --> 13:14.001
trying to prepare you
for every possible threat.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.796
"Always keep your hands
in sight."

13:16.837 --> 13:20.591
"Remember, people think
you're bigger and scarier

13:20.633 --> 13:23.135
than you actually are."

13:23.177 --> 13:26.138
"Never back-talk,
never fight back."

13:26.180 --> 13:29.225
But it didn't matter.
We still lost you.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.186
I want you near me. In sight.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.522
You have a community
in Florida.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.565
And I have one here.

13:36.607 --> 13:42.029
I own my own business, got
friends, a-a girlfriend.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.157
No, you-you-you, you haven't had
time to give George

13:45.199 --> 13:47.743
or Horseshoe Bay a chance.
You know, in fact...

13:47.785 --> 13:50.162
Hey, George!
How'd you like

13:50.204 --> 13:52.873
to show the Nickersons
the best of Horseshoe Bay?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.377
Yes.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.504
(chuckles)
I would love that.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.761
Johnny Mac. Yeah.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.347
I haven't thought
about Mac in years.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.642
Who knew his memory
would earn me a lunch?

14:11.684 --> 14:16.146
I, I got your name
from the funeral home.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.023
You were the only one
who signed the guest book.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.650
'Cause I was the only
one who showed up.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.360
Mac and I dated.

14:21.402 --> 14:25.739
I fell for a mean old drunk
who couldn't keep a job.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.533
He'd couch-surf

14:27.575 --> 14:30.327
or squat at his old orphanage
that had closed down.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.458
Before he died, he got
paranoid... and violent.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.169
I finally walked.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.422
Did he have any other
friends in town?

14:41.463 --> 14:42.548
Just one.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.426
But Buddy didn't even come
to the funeral.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.470
Guess he got sick
of Mac's crap, too.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.265
Sorry, did you say "Buddy"?
Was there a...

14:51.307 --> 14:52.558
There's a Buddy?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.018
Mac was such a drunk,

14:54.059 --> 14:56.812
his only friend
was his bartender Buddy.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.108
There's a whole section

15:01.150 --> 15:03.736
on the Revolutionary
War, Mrs. Nickerson.

15:03.777 --> 15:07.114
Mm-hmm. My fifth-graders
are starting that unit.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.908
George, are you okay?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.367
I'm smiling.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.369
Neddy, can you find someone
who works here?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.205
I want to get in this
locked box of powder horns.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.957
NICK:
Look, I'm gonna
get a sales clerk.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.377
We might as well ask about the
Aglaeca record while we're here.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922
Two birds, one sea ghost.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.179
Hello?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.059
Anyone here?

15:40.230 --> 15:42.316
(eerie breathing echoes)

15:57.247 --> 15:59.083
Hey, Buddy,

15:59.124 --> 16:00.584
can you get me a drink?

16:01.543 --> 16:04.129
O-Of-of course. Mac.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.756
I'm in real trouble,
Buddy.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.466
Me and the others did
something stupid.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.926
We called out to that thing
in the sea

16:08.968 --> 16:10.135
and now it's trying
to kill us all.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.304
Hey-hey, Mac, did you, uh,

16:12.346 --> 16:16.058
did you, did you get
the 45 with the sea shanty?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.060
Huh? Wh-What, uh,

16:18.102 --> 16:20.104
wh-what happened to that record?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.647
(creaking)

16:21.689 --> 16:23.774
Hey, hey, hey.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.151
Okay, just, just...

16:26.193 --> 16:27.945
Okay. Just...

16:30.656 --> 16:32.366
(panting)

16:55.848 --> 16:57.433
Nancy. Are you
kidding me right now?

16:57.474 --> 16:58.684
Could you...

16:58.726 --> 17:00.477
(bell jingles)

17:00.519 --> 17:02.521
Welcome to The Claw.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.066
Forget it.
I'll do it myself.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.276
NICK:
Um...

17:07.317 --> 17:11.655
Uh, Mom, this is Nancy.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.657
Nancy. Carson Drew's Nancy?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.409
I've heard so many
lovely things about you.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.702
My husband and I
are forever grateful

17:16.744 --> 17:19.371
to your father
for defending Ned.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.081
Carson's a wonderful man.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.208
That's what they tell me.
(chuckles)

17:23.250 --> 17:25.085
(clears throat)
Um...

17:25.127 --> 17:26.503
(whispers):
We saw Casper the friendly drunk

17:26.545 --> 17:27.838
at the antique store.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.215
Ooh. Uh, employee meeting!

17:30.257 --> 17:33.218
Oh, uh, Mom, if you,
if you sit right there,

17:33.260 --> 17:35.262
I'll be, I'll be right back.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.559
NANCY:
Why is Nick the only person
that Buddy appears to?

17:40.601 --> 17:43.145
I think I just
figured out why.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.855
This is a picture from the
Rusty Hull in the '70s.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.857
Take a look.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.067
NICK:
So Mac thinks
I'm his best friend

17:48.108 --> 17:49.943
because Buddy and I
are both Black?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.446
BESS:
Okay, casual racism aside,

17:52.488 --> 17:54.031
did he mention anything
about where he put the record?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.699
No, he was too busy
smashing up mirrors

17:55.741 --> 17:56.950
to talk about 45 storage.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.912
What about the orphanage
he grew up in?

17:59.953 --> 18:02.331
His ex-girlfriend said
that he squatted there.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.583
I can't find a record of
any Horseshoe Bay orphanage.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.543
Yeah, well, then we're just
gonna have to consult

18:06.585 --> 18:08.545
a professional.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.755
(line ringing)

18:09.797 --> 18:11.465
So far, nothing.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.050
Yeah, like it never existed.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.676
I'll keep looking
once I get home, though.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.178
All right. Bye.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.180
(knocks on door)

18:18.222 --> 18:20.682
(siren wailing in distance)

18:20.724 --> 18:23.393
Yo.
Hey.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.562
A little housewarming gift.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.273
I don't know what to say.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.068
Maybe you can tell me
your side of the story.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.862
Help me understand how
you did what you did.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.073
Come on.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.283
We were a family.

18:38.325 --> 18:42.162
And I was afraid
that telling Nancy the truth

18:42.204 --> 18:44.331
would change that.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.084
And her, forever.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.753
And then that's what happened.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.631
You ever have
these moments where

18:52.673 --> 18:56.468
you know something terrible
is coming,

18:56.510 --> 19:00.472
so you-you just don't look
right at it, you-you try

19:00.514 --> 19:04.476
and focus on the present
where everything's perfect?

19:05.727 --> 19:08.814
All the time... lately.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.610
Hey.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.863
Listen, I don't know anything

19:15.904 --> 19:19.032
that's going on
with you guys right now,

19:19.074 --> 19:23.620
but if there's ever anything
that you or any of you need...

19:26.707 --> 19:29.877
There's one thing.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.463
Do you remember an orphanage
around here,

19:33.505 --> 19:36.008
maybe in, like,
the '60s or the '70s?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.803
Yeah.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.600
I think it was called Fernwood.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.769
So it-it actually existed?

19:47.811 --> 19:53.650
All I remember was that
it closed when I was a kid.

19:53.692 --> 19:58.906
(thunder crashes)
And became something
of an urban legend after that.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.451
Rumor said it was somewhere
out in Stratemeyer Woods.

20:02.492 --> 20:07.539
But the place was scrubbed from
all maps and public records.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.541
(wood creaking)

20:09.583 --> 20:11.668
(wind whistling)

20:14.338 --> 20:18.842
Somebody worked hard to make
sure this place got forgotten.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.890
(animal squeals)
(gasps)

20:24.932 --> 20:26.516
NICK:
Looks like they left in a hurry.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.393
ACE:
Looks like
they straight-up vanished.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.103
I'm getting serious
Roanoke vibes.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.313
NANCY:
We should split up.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.440
We'll cover more ground.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.407
No luck.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.661
Ugh.
Yeah. Nothing over here, either.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.995
You're gonna want to see this.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.456
We found it in one
of the bedrooms.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.459
Hey, there's my good friend Mac.
Yeah, and that's Rita.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.628
GEORGE:
The ghost who tried to kill me
during the nor'easter.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.547
I've seen all
of these people before.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.299
There's Javier from Larkspur.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.760
Autumn and Perry
outside Claire's house.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.512
Rita at The Claw.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.306
They were all ghosts.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.724
What day did Mac die on?

21:07.766 --> 21:10.310
July 17, 1975.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.437
Check it out.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.897
Autumn Curtis, Perry Barber,

21:13.939 --> 21:16.149
Rita Howell, Javier Perez
and Mac,

21:16.191 --> 21:17.567
they all died on the same day.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.112
What, all in freak accidents?

21:20.153 --> 21:22.781
Those were the people that
called to the Aglaeca with Mac.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.701
Hey, what about, what
about this guy, huh?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.452
With the fox tattoo.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.912
Uh, AJ.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.831
I don't think I've
seen his ghost before.

21:30.872 --> 21:34.084
I did find a registrar.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.966
"Akira Jacob Nishiyama."

21:41.008 --> 21:42.884
(whispers):
AJ.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.928
He was an orphan here, too.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.388
Right, so were all the others.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.100
Can't find an obituary for AJ.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.643
'Cause maybe he died
in another country?

21:51.685 --> 21:54.730
Or they never found his body.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.315
Where'd you find
that photograph?

21:56.356 --> 21:57.816
Upstairs.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.985
Could've been Mac's room?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.738
That's where he would've hid
the 45 if he came back here.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.489
Yeah.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.433
Uh... Hey, guys?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.352
There's a vent under there.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.645
BESS:
Hey, it's a perfect

22:35.687 --> 22:38.357
hiding place
for a missing record.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.280
(gasping)

22:54.122 --> 22:56.166
(siren wailing in distance)

22:56.208 --> 22:58.418
NANCY:
Detective Tamura.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.629
TAMURA:
Ah. Lucky for me.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.172
It's the Hero of Horseshoe Bay.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.840
I'm fairly certain that skeleton

23:03.882 --> 23:06.385
will be identified
as AJ Nishiyama.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.846
Sorry, I'm unaccustomed
to getting evidence briefings

23:09.888 --> 23:11.848
from seafood
restaurant waitstaff.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.767
What the hell were you
even doing out here?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.769
We, uh, we went
for a drive.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.354
In the middle
of the night?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.689
It was dark. We got lost.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.191
What makes you believe
the bones belong to someone

23:21.233 --> 23:22.401
named AJ Nishiyama?

23:22.442 --> 23:24.611
Call it a hunch.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.864
The motto
of the armchair detective.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.366
I prefer facts.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.742
The coroner is on his way
to the lab

23:30.784 --> 23:32.828
so he can run
dental records, but...

23:35.205 --> 23:37.290
...thanks for your hunch.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.838
NANCY:
Let's say
you're a missing record.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.215
Where do you hang out?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.800
ACE:
Not at the library.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.678
My mom spearheaded
the changeover to CDs.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.304
I objected.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.099
(electricity crackling)

23:54.141 --> 23:56.059
What do we pay
the power for?

23:59.521 --> 24:00.814
Whoa.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.607
You okay, Nick?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.528
Wait, y-y-you-you guys
don't see him in the mirror?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.447
(clattering)
(gasping)

24:09.656 --> 24:11.491
NANCY: Did Mac do that?
Yeah.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.534
Nick, get him
to talk to you.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.994
NICK:
Hey, hey, hey.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.787
Hey, Mac, Mac, it's me.
It's me, Buddy.

24:15.829 --> 24:19.082
Huh? Hey.
Do you, uh...

24:19.124 --> 24:21.126
y-- uh, y-you want a drink?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.044
Where did you hide it?

24:23.086 --> 24:27.048
The-the-the record?
That's what I hid?

24:27.090 --> 24:28.925
Tell me where it is!

24:28.967 --> 24:30.177
Okay, okay, just-just calm down.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.471
(rapid breathing)

24:32.512 --> 24:33.972
(screams)

24:36.266 --> 24:38.268
(panting)

24:40.187 --> 24:41.396
Are you okay?

24:41.438 --> 24:42.647
Uh, yeah.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.566
Yeah, I'm good.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.863
He's gone.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.490
At least...

24:51.531 --> 24:52.908
at least he didn't come out
of the mirror this time.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.826
Wait, he can come
through the mirror?

24:54.868 --> 24:55.994
Uh, yeah, yeah.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.872
If-if the mirror breaks,
I think.

24:58.914 --> 25:03.084
But he-he, um, he yelled at me
to tell him where I hid it.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.086
NANCY:
Well, it looks like
Mac was as desperate

25:05.128 --> 25:07.839
for the 45 as we are, so I guess
we're on the right track.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.382
Nick, what are those
bruises on your neck?

25:11.801 --> 25:13.220
BESS:
They're ghost hands.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.972
Trust me, they hurt.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.853
NANCY:
Hey, have you seen
the big dustpan?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.438
What's that?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.649
From the junk bin.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.651
Remember when we put Bess
in charge of purchasing?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.653
Ah, right. The
sous vide machine

25:29.694 --> 25:32.906
and peppermint coffee.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.533
I just found a home
for some of it.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.243
Really?

25:36.284 --> 25:37.994
God, nobody on Earth
likes peppermint coffee

25:38.036 --> 25:40.038
except for Carson Drew.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.669
Have you been to s-- to see him?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.254
Well, it kind of just happened.

25:47.295 --> 25:52.592
I saw him struggling
with a... futon frame.

25:52.634 --> 25:56.012
Looked like he needed somebody
to talk to. That's all.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.976
Well, I mean,
he could have talked to me.

26:01.017 --> 26:04.354
For 19 years,
he could have talked to me.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.064
You're right.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.984
You're 100% right.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.155
But with the Aglaeca
coming after us,

26:14.197 --> 26:16.324
we might not have years.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.785
(phone vibrating)

26:18.827 --> 26:20.120
Oh.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.000
Hey, what's up, Detective?

26:25.041 --> 26:26.710
TAMURA:
I've got some info
on that John Doe in the wall.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.336
Figured I'd share it.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.838
Thought you didn't have time
for amateurs.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.923
Well, I wanted to ease
your mind.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.593
You seemed to care
about those bones you found.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.804
And that's it?
No ulterior motives?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.431
Are you this argumentative

26:39.472 --> 26:40.640
with everyone
who tries to help you?

26:40.682 --> 26:42.309
Can I answer that?

26:42.350 --> 26:46.062
Oh, good, I'm on speakerphone.
Hello, everyone.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.897
Well, through
actual police work,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.441
we matched the dental records.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.027
Victim's name was Buddy Fowler.

26:52.068 --> 26:55.614
Broken wrist and forearm suggest
he was beaten pretty badly,

26:55.655 --> 26:57.032
probably right before
someone fractured

26:57.073 --> 26:58.533
his hyoid and C6 vertebra.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.118
Buddy died of strangulation.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.578
I'm thinking the fight
happened elsewhere,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.038
and then the killer
hid the body.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.124
Any hunches on why
Buddy the skeleton

27:06.166 --> 27:08.126
ended up in that particular room

27:08.168 --> 27:09.919
at a long-lost orphanage
where you and your friends

27:09.961 --> 27:13.632
just happened to be conducting
an unwarranted search?

27:13.673 --> 27:15.717
Can I get back
to you on that?

27:16.676 --> 27:18.762
I eagerly await our next chat.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.768
Ace, when did you
become Forensic Fred?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.770
John Sander's been
sending me links.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.439
Further my knowledge.
Check that out.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.358
Common result of strangulation.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.443
Okay, so Mac

27:33.485 --> 27:35.487
strangled Buddy...

27:35.528 --> 27:36.905
And now he thinks I'm Buddy.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.783
So now he's gonna
try and kill you?

27:39.824 --> 27:41.159
MILLIE:
Who's going to kill you?

27:41.201 --> 27:43.244
Ned Nickerson.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.872
You'd better start telling me
the truth right now.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.840
There's a ghost who wants
to kill you because he thinks

27:55.882 --> 27:58.093
you're his Black best friend?

27:58.134 --> 27:59.678
I know the existence
of the supernatural

27:59.719 --> 28:01.096
is hard to believe...

28:01.137 --> 28:03.014
Excuse me.
I travel with my Bible,

28:03.056 --> 28:05.433
prayer shawl and anointing oils.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.936
You don't need to convince me
of the supernatural.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.564
What I want to know is why
you want to stay here, Neddy.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.024
Stephen King is right.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.151
Maine is filled
with terrifying ghosts.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.153
ACE:
Ma'am, we also
have lobsters.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.989
We have blueberries.
Ah, yeah.
They're both delicious,

28:20.031 --> 28:22.367
but not together.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.036
Ned, we are going
back to Florida.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.496
Mom, no. We are not.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.707
Why? Because of
your girlfriend?

28:28.748 --> 28:30.917
If you really cared
about my son,

28:30.959 --> 28:33.920
you would tell him to go home
where we can protect him.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.714
Look, I don't tell him
to do anyth...

28:35.755 --> 28:38.508
Okay, this isn't about George,
Mom. I'm a grown man.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.135
I'm not going back.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.011
And if you can't deal with that,

28:42.053 --> 28:44.639
if it's too painful,
then don't visit.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.439
Mom...

28:52.480 --> 28:54.023
(door opens, bell jingles)

28:54.065 --> 28:56.151
(door closes)

29:10.206 --> 29:13.460
Hey, I'm sorry things got
heated with your mom.

29:13.501 --> 29:14.794
NICK:
It's not your fault.

29:16.796 --> 29:19.841
Also...

29:19.883 --> 29:21.676
Look, George and I
were gonna tell you

29:21.718 --> 29:24.095
when things calmed down,
but after everything

29:24.137 --> 29:26.681
with Carson and with Owen,

29:26.723 --> 29:28.683
it just-- it...
(sighs)

29:28.725 --> 29:31.019
just wasn't the right
time to talk.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.022
You don't have
to explain anything.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.608
For what it's worth,
I'm, I'm really glad

29:36.649 --> 29:38.568
that you guys are happy.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.280
Thanks.
Yeah.

29:43.948 --> 29:47.744
Uh, so is everything
gonna be okay with your mom?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.122
Considering that was
the first time

29:51.164 --> 29:54.542
I ever said no to her,
probably not.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.587
But she's leaving,

29:57.629 --> 30:01.591
and I can't help thinking

30:01.633 --> 30:04.552
this might be the last time
I see her.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.263
Yeah, I know what you mean.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.768
You still haven't
talked to Carson?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.436
No.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.939
I am soldiering on
without his empty assurances

30:15.980 --> 30:18.483
that everything's gonna be okay.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.861
(sighs)
And yet...

30:21.903 --> 30:23.279
You miss it.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.114
Yeah.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.200
Yeah, I know.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.286
I guess it's up to us
to solve our own problem.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.247
Hmm.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.793
You're working on a theory.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.795
It's just that
the dates line up.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.464
So, Mac died July 17, 1975.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.216
That's the same day
that Buddy disappeared,

30:43.258 --> 30:45.635
according to his missing
persons report at the time.

30:45.677 --> 30:50.139
You said that Mac accused Buddy
of hiding the 45 from him.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.559
Right. And you think maybe
that's why Mac killed him?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.478
Mac left behind a
significant unpaid bar tab.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.314
I-If Buddy knew how much
that record meant to Mac,

30:58.356 --> 31:00.984
h-he could have taken it
and used it as collateral.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.402
And Mac never found
the record,

31:02.443 --> 31:05.780
so maybe the 45's
still at the bar.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.782
Right.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.868
So I think we should go
back to the Rusty Hull.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.130
Mrs. Nickerson.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.634
I'm sorry that I snapped
at you before.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.388
I am generally foulmouthed,
prickly and distrustful.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.600
But I have a mother
who is a neglectful alcoholic,

31:33.641 --> 31:36.019
and I've had to raise
three little sisters on my own.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.229
It was really hard,
but I adapted,

31:38.271 --> 31:41.608
and life hasn't
made me nice;

31:41.649 --> 31:43.610
it's made me vicious.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.029
Which is why I'm the perfect
person to watch Nick's back.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.739
I'm here now
because Nick is in trouble,

31:47.780 --> 31:49.449
and I really don't think
you should leave

31:49.490 --> 31:51.451
while you two
are still in a fight.

31:55.496 --> 31:59.250
So... how do we
get him out of trouble?

to rent the place for the night?

32:14.015 --> 32:17.810

34:57.720 --> 35:00.014
Class of 1975 reunion.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.059
That was our future.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.906
Mrs. Nickerson?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.742
Oh. I wanted to see you
before I left town.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.410
Leave you with something.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.621
Cut those into strips.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.124
Yes, ma'am.

35:26.165 --> 35:30.920
When I saw how ferociously you
defended Ned from that ghost,

35:30.962 --> 35:34.423
all I could think was, this girl
really cares about my son.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.510
I do.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.596
This is his favorite,

35:40.638 --> 35:42.723
chicken and dumplings.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.393
It smells amazing.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.937
Now, you have to use canned
biscuits for the dumplings

35:47.979 --> 35:49.981
instead of dough
from scratch.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.482
That's the key.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.860
I don't share that
with just anyone.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.696
Thank you, Mrs. Nickerson.
