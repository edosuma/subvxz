00:00.001 --> 00:05.204
<i> Previously on</i> Reign:
Francis refused my request
to let me court you.

00:05.206 --> 00:09.308
I am going to marry you.
And I am prepared to wait.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.643
I am dying. I've already
sent for my brother.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.612
He doesn't know
that he'll be king soon enough.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.315
Charles. Welcome
back, little brother.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.284
Let me hold you in my arms,
Elizabeth.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.586
Or let me
leave court.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.587
ELIZABETH:
<i> I can't.</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:22.654
<i> I need you near.</i>

00:22.656 --> 00:24.323
Elizabeth's real war is with me.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.457
Perhaps her advisors
have realized this

00:25.459 --> 00:27.393
and are
pressuring her.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.763
Are you suggesting there's a way
to turn the pope against Mary?

00:30.765 --> 00:33.465
She'll be disgraced.
Forced off her throne.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.068
Catherine wants to destroy me
and if she can't,

00:36.070 --> 00:37.269
she'll help Elizabeth
destroy my nation.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.171
Clearly, we should have
taken your head

00:39.173 --> 00:40.172
the last time
you betrayed your son.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.108
(growls)

00:43.110 --> 00:45.577
(keys jangle, door unlocks)

00:45.579 --> 00:47.646
(door creaks open)

00:52.319 --> 00:55.054
Take your hands off of me!
How dare you?

00:55.056 --> 00:58.157
All prisoners are to be relieved
of their personal effects.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.392
Do prisoners have the right
to know how long

01:00.394 --> 01:03.629
they're forced to suffer the
sight of these four vile walls

01:03.631 --> 01:05.731
and your smug,
weaselly face?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.135
I want to see my son.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.538
I am the king of France's
mother.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.740
And he is the one
who put you here.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.408
We know who you are,
Queen Mother.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.643
But you can hold your breath.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.411
For this is the one place

01:19.413 --> 01:21.613
it does not matter.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.493
God help me.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.132
MARY:<i> There's only one way</i>
<i> we can be sure</i>

01:40.134 --> 01:41.433
<i> that Catherine</i>
<i> won't betray us again.</i>

01:41.435 --> 01:42.534
I can't do it.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.569
I can't.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.838
Her crimes are treasonous.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.373
I will not condemn
my mother to death.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.309
Especially not as
my last act as king.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.545
The illness has progressed

01:53.547 --> 01:55.180
and it's becoming
more difficult to hide.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.849
I refuse to give up hope.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.385
I know this is difficult.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.188
It's more than difficult.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.257
Today, in particular.

02:06.861 --> 02:08.861
I'm not pregnant.

02:08.863 --> 02:12.364
Again.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.733
It's all right.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.637
I just wanted this.
A part of you.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.373
I know.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.543
I would love nothing more
than to see you pregnant,

02:24.545 --> 02:27.279
radiant, a mother.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.748
But fate has other plans.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.551
Charles will
inherit my throne.

02:32.553 --> 02:36.555
But... he's so young, Mary.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.824
A young king needs a regent.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.626
And who can I trust
to rule over France

02:40.628 --> 02:43.362
whenever our young monarch
turns his head?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.364
Elizabeth is after your country,
Scotland is in jeopardy.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.766
And your status at court...

02:47.768 --> 02:50.903
You want me to marry Charles.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.638
Yes.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.774
To protect you
and secure my family's future.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.444
I understand that, the politics.
But this is a marriage.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.747
You're not naive
to the burdens of royalty.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.916
You and I... us.

03:03.918 --> 03:06.285
We're not just royalty.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.620
We are more
than an alliance.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.722
We're different.
We love each other.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.725
And we always will.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.930
Mary, please, you know
this makes sense.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.837
A life in France

03:25.839 --> 03:28.240
without you.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.944
Marriage is just
a legal agreement.

03:31.946 --> 03:35.781
In time, you could
move back to Scotland.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.352
Unless it progressed
into something more...

03:40.354 --> 03:43.455
We both know that
will never happen.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.624
But you're right--

03:45.626 --> 03:48.694
it would be the best thing to
protect both our countries.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.000
I will marry
your brother.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.269
Even though it
breaks my heart.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.944
We must share our plan
with our future king.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.984
MAN:
<i> Your girlish collusion</i>

04:11.986 --> 04:14.686
with Catherine de Medici
has placed England

04:14.688 --> 04:17.322
firmly in the middle
of an international crisis.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.857
The Vatican knows
we sponsored

04:18.859 --> 04:20.425
the nobles
sent to slander Mary.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.627
A plan
that you

04:21.629 --> 04:23.729
and Catherine hatched.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.432
What the Vatican knows,
Spain knows.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.868
We are at peace with Spain
and King Philip.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.870
A very fragile peace.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.739
He views the attack on Mary

04:33.741 --> 04:36.008
as an attack on all
Catholic monarchs.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.643
King Philip
has threatened

04:37.645 --> 04:38.877
to walk away
from the trade agreement

04:38.879 --> 04:40.612
we've spent months
negotiating.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.748
We can find a way to make amends
with both Spain and France.

04:42.750 --> 04:46.018
I'm afraid that burden
lies with our queen.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.353
Her Majesty will give testimony
speaking to the circumstances

04:48.355 --> 04:50.389
surrounding Catherine's time
in England. Testimony that

04:50.391 --> 04:52.324
clears our queen
of any involvement.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.925
Then we look forward to hearing
what you have to say.

04:53.927 --> 04:58.397
The Medici issue
will be resolved,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.598
and swiftly.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.732
King Philip
gains more

05:00.734 --> 05:02.367
with us than against us.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.436
If only I felt confident
making the same claim

05:04.438 --> 05:05.971
about members of this council.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.606
There's also
the matter

05:07.608 --> 05:09.508
of a new English ambassador
to France.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.043
Relations
are tense.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.644
Sending an ambassador
conveys a message of peace

05:12.646 --> 05:14.413
at no political cost to us.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.081
I have
a nomination.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.083
There is one member
of this council

05:18.085 --> 05:19.685
whose track record
of diplomacy

05:19.687 --> 05:22.621
uniquely prepares him
for a position overseas.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.457
The ambassadorship
would be a sizeable promotion,

05:25.459 --> 05:27.859
but one that is long overdue.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.928
Lord Robert Dudley.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.768
Do we have
a second?

05:38.439 --> 05:40.739
The nomination
has been seconded.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.776
Your Majesty?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.647
I'll take it under advisement.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.584
Lady Dudley. It's done. Your
husband's the only nomination.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.985
Our loss is France's gain.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.721
What will the frogs make of this

05:55.723 --> 05:57.556
wily English rose?

05:57.558 --> 05:58.924
I don't care.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.692
I'd follow my
husband anywhere.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.694
Especially if it means
I never have to think of him

06:02.696 --> 06:04.563
writhing
in Elizabeth's bed again.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.965
Our queen truly has that much
of a hold over your husband?

06:06.967 --> 06:10.435
I suppose there's
no accounting for taste.

06:10.437 --> 06:14.039
All this talk of France inspires
thoughts of their rumored

06:14.041 --> 06:15.907
more ambitious
lovemaking.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.843
There are, after all,
acts my wife

06:17.845 --> 06:21.380
refuses to submit to.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.604
(gasps)

06:49.076 --> 06:51.843
Leave us.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.712
When you shared secrets
in Catherine's bed,

06:53.714 --> 06:56.715
did they include the specifics
of our bath time flirtation?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.583
Why?
What's happened?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.619
A rat.
In my bath.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.754
Well, even the house
of a king

07:02.756 --> 07:05.023
is not immune
to a rodent infestation.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.692
No, it was planted there,
deliberately.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.996
This was inside its
vile little mouth.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.702
"One rat down,

07:17.704 --> 07:19.971
two to go."

07:19.973 --> 07:21.807
But Catherine is in prison.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.810
Giving her plenty of time
to scheme against her rivals.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.679
You betrayed Catherine,
had her exiled,

07:27.681 --> 07:30.582
and then made a public request
to court me.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.050
Word of your intention has
spread all over the castle.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.985
including Catherine's cell.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.954
I swore that
I would protect you.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.056
But you also swore that you
would never hurt me again.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.859
But you have. This is
why I said no to you.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.561
I do have feelings for you.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.862
But I wanted to
keep them private,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.664
and I was right
to want that.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.666
Even rejecting you
as a potential husband

07:47.668 --> 07:49.868
has put me in danger.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.537
And that's why
we can never be together.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.475
FRANCIS:<i> My news</i>
<i> doesn't leave this room.</i>

07:56.477 --> 07:57.943
Once the world
learns of my illness,

07:57.945 --> 07:59.611
our enemies will move in,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.581
try to take advantage
of France's weakness.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.483
We must prepare
for the transition of power

08:04.485 --> 08:06.084
as a family
and in secret.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.752
Does Mother know?

08:07.754 --> 08:08.787
Catherine no longer
has the privilege

08:08.789 --> 08:10.055
of contact with her children.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.157
CLAUDE:
She wouldn't be of any comfort

08:12.159 --> 08:14.092
to me, either.
But you're dying,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.227
she is your mother.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.897
No, I've recognized John,

08:18.899 --> 08:21.199
given him lands
and titles, but

08:21.201 --> 08:23.235
he'll never be king.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.871
When Lola learns of my fate
she will fear for him.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.939
You understand the
life of a bastard son.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.608
John will be protected.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.611
I promise.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.514
Now you see why we had to
send for you.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.749
I should've studied.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.885
Actually listened
as my guardians

08:39.887 --> 08:41.219
blathered on about tithes

08:41.221 --> 08:42.954
and land reforms.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.689
You were right.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.191
I never thought it...

08:46.193 --> 08:47.559
Give us some time.

08:57.104 --> 09:01.039
I have decided
that after my passing,

09:01.041 --> 09:04.643
you will take Mary
as your wife.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.579
But she loves you.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.114
When the
time comes,

09:09.116 --> 09:11.016
I want my own wife,
someone my own age.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.784
Now, you know that
that is not always possible.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.020
Our own marriage was arranged

09:15.022 --> 09:16.655
to bring our two countries
together.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.156
What has Scotland
ever done for France?

09:18.158 --> 09:21.860
Charles, this marriage
would not only benefit Mary.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.895
A young king
needs a regent.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.031
And we can't trust anyone
with that amount of power.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.799
Usurpers would
come after your crown.

09:27.801 --> 09:28.900
And if I'm to be married.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.001
Married to a queen,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.169
you won't need a regent.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.304
Mary
is an experienced ruler

09:32.306 --> 09:33.605
who would ensure

09:33.607 --> 09:34.940
a smooth transition of power.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.309
I want to know
what Mother thinks.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.777
I told you before.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.645
Mother's opinion
doesn't matter,

09:40.647 --> 09:41.880
not anymore.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.081
Well, she knows more

09:43.083 --> 09:44.349
about political strategy
than anyone.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.151
How could her opinion
not matter?

09:46.153 --> 09:49.321
You don't understand who she is.
The real Catherine.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.656
Then make me understand.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.825
I-I don't even know
why she's locked up.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.027
So she went to England--
is that a crime?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.929
Why won't you just tell me?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.798
Fine,

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
you can hate her for
whatever it is she did,

10:01.802 --> 10:03.101
but she's still my mother.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.103
And I am still your king.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.940
For today.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.642
But if I'm
to wed Mary,

10:10.644 --> 10:11.910
you must die.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.313
And when that happens,
I will be king.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.950
I don't want to get married.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.319
And I don't have to.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.097
No one can know the specifics
of my mother's crimes.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.665
Kidnapping my son,
fleeing to England

10:33.667 --> 10:36.901
to marry off my brother
to our greatest rival.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.870
And if Charles,
if anyone found out

10:38.872 --> 10:41.906
that she tried
to smear your name...
By telling the truth.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.042
Francis, my indiscretion
with Condé...
Truth...

10:44.044 --> 10:46.177
became treason when
she took it to the Vatican.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.646
And that serious charge

10:47.648 --> 10:49.347
in the hands
of my mother's enemies...

10:49.349 --> 10:51.316
they'd call for her execution.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.951
We need Charles'
cooperation,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.786
but if he demands
to see her...

10:54.788 --> 10:57.322
Catherine will scheme and plot
until the day she dies.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.424
Every time someone
takes a tray of food

10:59.426 --> 11:01.359
to that cell, there is a chance

11:01.361 --> 11:03.294
she will bend them
to her will,

11:03.296 --> 11:05.830
use that opportunity
to hatch her revenge.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.866
And after you are gone...

11:07.868 --> 11:09.668
Charles will have the power
to see her anyway.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.870
He will come from Catherine,
having heard her plea

11:11.872 --> 11:14.939
that she was doing everything
for the good of France.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.841
We can tell him
our side, too,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.810
and be sure he
doesn't share it.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.013
Francis...

11:22.015 --> 11:24.149
your brother

11:24.151 --> 11:26.384
isn't asking for audience
with Catherine

11:26.386 --> 11:28.219
as the future king.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.056
He's a terrified boy who
needs the love of his mother.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.191
Let Catherine comfort her son.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.260
You're right.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.364
Let me speak to her first.

11:41.334 --> 11:45.070
(animals chittering, chirping)

11:49.743 --> 11:51.209
¶ ¶

12:02.723 --> 12:04.089
Stephan.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.123
How did you know...

12:05.125 --> 12:06.858
I know this is where you come

12:06.860 --> 12:09.394
to pick those wild raspberries
that John likes so much.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.330
Because you had me followed.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.798
No.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.470
Because I pay attention.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.205
Oh.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.744
And because I love you.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.279
Uh, maybe Catherine
is coming for us,

12:28.281 --> 12:30.014
but if you and I

12:30.016 --> 12:32.517
have to pay her price
for being together, then...

12:32.519 --> 12:35.019
why don't we just be together?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.088
But why marriage?

12:37.090 --> 12:40.158
Why has a binding union
become so important to you,

12:40.160 --> 12:43.428
of all people?
Because it's important to you.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.165
You say you want just an affair,
but I know the moment

12:47.167 --> 12:48.833
I lay you down
beneath this tree,

12:48.835 --> 12:50.435
then you will see
there's more between us

12:50.437 --> 12:53.271
than just the stuff
of fleeting seduction.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.307
And you haven't given up
on the idea of a real family.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.976
If I can't
give you that,

12:57.978 --> 13:00.011
then out time together
is limited,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.446
no matter how we feel.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.982
Lola...

13:03.984 --> 13:06.151
I want you forever.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.454
(exhales) But as long
as Francis reigns,

13:09.456 --> 13:11.322
our relationship
will be forbidden.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.091
(sighs)

13:13.093 --> 13:15.093
I want you, Stephan,

13:15.095 --> 13:18.396
so I can get past
my fear of Catherine,
but if you want me,

13:18.398 --> 13:21.533
you need to stop holding out
for an impossible marriage.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.904
Do you love me enough
to meet me halfway?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.210
¶ ¶

13:42.355 --> 13:44.355
Where's my<i> zibellino?</i>

13:44.357 --> 13:45.557
Your what?

13:45.559 --> 13:47.292
It's Italian for "sable."

13:47.294 --> 13:49.527
And I don't speak Italian.
A sable for a blanket--

13:49.529 --> 13:50.995
I can't sleep without it.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.198
Besides, don't you know
how valuable...

13:54.367 --> 13:56.835
No, of course you don't.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.536
Perhaps the princess
can think back

13:58.538 --> 14:01.506
to where she may have
left her...<i> zibellino?</i>

14:01.508 --> 14:04.042
The Versailles carriage is
the only place I haven't looked.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.844
That particular carriage is

14:05.846 --> 14:07.846
currently halfway
between here and Paris.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.113
If you say so.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.315
Find it for me.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.217
No.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.018
Catherine's
locked up now,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.987
so you can't run to Mommy
and complain.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.590
But please, feel free
to summon me again when you have

14:18.592 --> 14:21.926
a request that falls within my
actual job responsibilities...

14:21.928 --> 14:24.229
Princess.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.635
Poison.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.537
It has to be poison.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.306
I have already
been tested for poison,

14:35.308 --> 14:38.343
given herbal remedies,
even leeched.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.311
And each doctor
only reiterated the truth,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.981
that this illness
is real and incurable.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.916
My eldest child faces
certain death,

14:44.918 --> 14:47.085
and I am confined to a cell,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.953
unable to comfort him.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.055
Confined by your own betrayal.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.958
I'm your mother--
I've held you in my arms,

14:53.960 --> 14:55.994
I nursed you
when they mocked me,

14:55.996 --> 14:57.428
and they said that feeding you

14:57.430 --> 14:59.464
was the act
of a gruesome peasant.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.299
But I did because
I knew... (sniffles)

15:01.301 --> 15:04.636
it would make you
strong... and I...
Stop.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.271
I raised Mary, too,

15:06.273 --> 15:07.639
don't forget--
I loved her

15:07.641 --> 15:10.174
till she weakened you
and she weakened France.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.442
I said stop.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.644
She's shown me
more love than

15:12.646 --> 15:14.379
anyone in this family
ever could.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.915
True love, without condition.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.416
I protect you.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.419
Let me out of here
and I will continue to do that.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.022
'Cause you'll need me
once Charles

15:24.024 --> 15:25.590
is king.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.027
He's already here,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.295
isn't he?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.463
It<i> was</i> you that sent for him.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.466
I've asked him to wed Mary.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.602
(slow inhale)

15:37.604 --> 15:39.704
But he wants to see you.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.439
And I know
that you'll try

15:41.441 --> 15:43.041
to poison him against me.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.275
I'm his mother.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.310
He needs love

15:45.312 --> 15:46.511
and support.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.082
DONATELLA:
Mmm.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.551
This wine is heavenly--
but, then, I suppose

15:53.553 --> 15:56.154
they save the best vintage
for Her Majesty.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.057
Donatella, your palate
betrays your Italian roots.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.692
I don't try to hide them.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.727
I find having an exotic wife

16:02.729 --> 16:05.063
bolsters my husband's reputation
at court.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.198
I have a favor.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.600
It's of international
importance.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.669
Political intrigue?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.638
Pour the wine.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.275
It does require a tiny fib.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.578
You must testify
before the privy council that...

16:20.580 --> 16:24.449
you are Catherine de Medici's
distant Florentine cousin,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.584
and you harbored her
here at court.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.619
Catherine de Medici was here?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.289
The harpy herself,
in the flesh?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.092
(chuckles) I'd kill
just to lay eyes on her.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.493
Well, imagine you had.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.196
Imagine you took pity

16:38.198 --> 16:41.366
on your poor exiled cousin
and provided her

16:41.368 --> 16:45.236
with asylum, and your good queen
never even knew she was here.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.405
Wouldn't I get
into some sort of... trouble?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.474
A slap on the
wrist, perhaps.

16:49.476 --> 16:53.011
But you'd have the queen
of England on your side.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.349
ELIZABETH:
Answer your queen, prisoner.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.284
Do you beg God
for his forgiveness?

17:00.286 --> 17:02.720
No. Why bother?

17:04.724 --> 17:07.458
I intend to commit the same
crime every day until I die.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.794
(laughs): Lord Dudley!
Shall we leave
the shackles on?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.096
Absolutely.
I remember when the
walls of a prison

17:12.098 --> 17:14.132
would have had you
cowering in fear.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.668
Of losing my head,
like my mother. (laughs)

17:17.670 --> 17:20.138
But you helped me
get past that fear.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.141
I needed you then...
and I need you now.

17:23.143 --> 17:27.412
Which is why you're
not going anywhere.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.647
The French ambassadorship.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.549
A ploy to separate us.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.085
I'll find out
who's behind it.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.288
Because the nomination
couldn't possibly be genuine.
(laughs)

17:37.290 --> 17:41.159
Nothing that goes on
in my privy council
chamber is genuine.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.363
You can't fight it.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.432
I can...

17:47.434 --> 17:50.568
by giving you...
a title that's even better.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.572
One that will raise your station
while keeping you here.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.709
(whispers):
They whisper about us.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.545
I am their queen.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.147
Their whispers are treason.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.717
You'll stay in England
where you belong,

18:06.719 --> 18:10.655
even if I have to take out
every last one of them.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.628
Donatella has taken
full responsibility

18:17.630 --> 18:20.765
for Catherine de Medici's
presence at court.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.167
I'm afraid that
will no longer suffice.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.435
The council has
several nobles claiming

18:24.437 --> 18:25.837
to have seen you
with the French queen mother

18:25.839 --> 18:28.106
during her time at the castle.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.108
"Several nobles"?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.776
Give me their names.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.644
Who knows if they even exist?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.246
The high lords
have challenged you

18:35.248 --> 18:36.414
to clean up your mess.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.282
They do not plan
to make it easy.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.419
And sullying my friend's
reputation isn't enough?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.387
Donatella trusts me.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.323
Now I'll have
to ask her

18:45.325 --> 18:48.259
to testify that
she introduced me to Catherine

18:48.261 --> 18:50.161
but withheld her royal identity,

18:50.163 --> 18:52.663
confess to lying to a queen.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.134
The council plots against you,
but it is you providing them

18:56.136 --> 18:57.268
with ammunition.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.870
One only had
to study your face

18:58.872 --> 19:00.271
when Lord Lionel
nominated Dudley

19:00.273 --> 19:02.173
to know that your affair
is back on.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.375
Robert isn't going anywhere.
I hear about your plans

19:04.377 --> 19:05.810
to give him
a different promotion.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.411
You cannot do it, Elizabeth.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.148
He would make
a fine ambassador--
and if you refuse,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.283
it will confirm
your indiscretion.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.719
To hold onto the crown,
you need to be pure,

19:14.721 --> 19:17.421
above recrimination.
Because I'm a woman?

19:17.423 --> 19:20.291
Because you must be viable
for a strategic marriage.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.693
Well, I agreed to meet
with Charles, didn't I?

19:22.695 --> 19:25.396
Only to be betrayed
and look like a fool.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.165
Other prospects will come along,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.834
but you'll only have a chance
with them if you end

19:29.836 --> 19:32.436
your relations
with a married man.
Stop.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.438
I hear you.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.440
I will not raise
Dudley's station.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.742
Elizabeth,

19:37.744 --> 19:39.877
the issue is larger
than this moment.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.547
You've never accepted the fact
that your life changed

19:42.549 --> 19:44.382
the moment
you become queen.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.884
These mistakes--
Catherine de Medici,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.419
Dudley--

19:48.421 --> 19:50.388
the people around you,
the ones who care,

19:50.390 --> 19:51.589
we will pay the price!

19:51.591 --> 19:53.758
(crying):
I am paying the price!

19:53.760 --> 19:56.194
I feel like a prisoner.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.831
Some prison.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.969
He's my brother, too,

20:04.971 --> 20:06.971
and he's protected me.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.639
Francis and I have
an agreement

20:08.641 --> 20:10.875
that he would never
force me to marry.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.810
How progressive of him.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.545
Charles, please!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.447
I need to know
that as king

20:16.449 --> 20:17.949
you'll do the same.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.384
You came here
to ask a favor?

20:20.386 --> 20:21.953
Of me?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.855
I'm about to inherit
a job I don't want,

20:24.857 --> 20:27.225
that I'll probably
fail miserably at.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.827
They want me to marry
my brother's wife.
And I'm sorry.

20:29.829 --> 20:30.995
Are you?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.763
It's hard
for all of us,

20:32.765 --> 20:36.434
being part of this family.
You're right,

20:36.436 --> 20:38.236
and that's why, as
part of this family,

20:38.238 --> 20:41.372
you'll marry whoever your
king commands you to.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.743
(sighs)

20:45.745 --> 20:48.713
I know you're scared,
but your brother is right--

20:48.715 --> 20:50.715
there will be threats.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.516
From the Bourbons in
Navarre in particular.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.685
King Antoine has
a blood claim.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.554
But there are other ways
to deal with them

20:56.556 --> 20:58.422
than marrying
the queen of Scots.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.024
Not according to Francis.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.726
Oh. Well,
he loves Mary.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.661
He's always been blind
to the drain

21:03.663 --> 21:06.564
the Scottish alliance has been
on our country.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.032
I have no interest

21:08.034 --> 21:10.401
in protecting Mary or Scotland.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.703
But I do want to protect myself.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.539
Listen, there is
no point in arguing

21:15.541 --> 21:17.942
the issue now, and
certainly not with a king.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.710
Just agree to the marriage.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.948
Engagements fall away all
the time, as you well know.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.683
To what end?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.451
I can't lie to Mary forever.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.553
Just until the time has come.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.555
Meaning my brother is dead?

21:31.557 --> 21:33.724
Yes.

21:33.726 --> 21:37.295
And you've installed me
at your side as regent.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.297
You've been imprisoned.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.665
For seeking
an alliance.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.301
For having views
counter to Mary's.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.537
You will come to understand it
all, and you will exonerate me.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.707
I would die to protect you.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.443
And surely, the same
cannot be said

21:52.445 --> 21:53.744
of your sister-in-law.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.414
Who would you rather
have in your corner?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.549
You're right.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.619
Good.

22:01.621 --> 22:05.890
Now you just convince Francis
to let you visit me regularly.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.925
Your guardians.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.694
How are your
studies progressing?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.829
I haven't been
as focused as I should.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.531
You're a teenage boy.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.099
There are more
compelling exploits?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.101
(laughs)

22:17.103 --> 22:19.904
We shall begin your education by
studying the realms' finances.

22:19.906 --> 22:23.107
Send a messenger to

22:23.109 --> 22:25.042
a Lord Germain in the village.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.777
And tell him
that you want...

22:26.779 --> 22:29.680
a full reckoning
of the realm's accounts.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.383
Be sure to use
that exact phrase.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.486
It'll impress Germain
that a boy your age understands

22:35.488 --> 22:36.787
the proper terms
of finance.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.724
Can you do
that for me?
Yeah.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.992
This was left for me
in my chambers.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.527
By Delphine.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.497
The witch?

22:46.499 --> 22:48.132
"There's a girl.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.101
"Her eyes sting
from smoke,

22:50.103 --> 22:52.136
and her skin smells like
freshly baked bread..."

22:52.138 --> 22:53.871
A kitchen servant.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.574
Delphine thinks this girl
is the murderer's next victim.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.477
Bash, the murderer<i> is</i> Delphine.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.878
She killed that
servant boy

23:00.880 --> 23:02.646
because he got mixed up
in her black magic.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.515
My instincts have always told me
that Delphine is innocent.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.751
So you're taking this letter
seriously?

23:06.753 --> 23:10.721
A heretic's claims
that conveniently absolve her?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.656
I need you to go to the kitchen,

23:12.658 --> 23:14.592
ask around,
see if anyone's gone missing.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.627
You spent time there
as a servant.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.462
They'll tell you
the truth.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.399
And if Delphine is merely
diverting us from her own guilt?

23:21.401 --> 23:23.000
Then we will seek justice.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.669
Either way, you're helping
to catch a murderer.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.738
(loud crowd chatter,
horse sputters)

23:27.740 --> 23:29.607
(dog barking, goat bleating)

23:29.609 --> 23:31.976
Lord Germain?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.079
A message from court.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.947
(horse sputters, whinnies)

23:36.949 --> 23:39.049
"Full reckoning"?

23:39.051 --> 23:41.552
Are you sure?

23:41.554 --> 23:42.820
How did you get this?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.655
By the hand
of the dauphin himself.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.757
He wrote it after meeting
with the queen mother.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.829
A new job.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.432
We'll need five men
in total.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.967
Where?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.969
Navarre.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.505
To shed some
Bourbon blood.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.610
I will marry you.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.878
(door closes)

24:07.880 --> 24:11.015
And how did you come
to your decision?

24:11.017 --> 24:13.117
I know how much
our mother hurt you.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.019
But you knew I needed her.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.921
You treated me fairly,
like a brother.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.889
Helped me understand that

24:18.891 --> 24:21.659
you want what's best for me.
You both do.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.494
You made the right choice.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.863
But you must remain
open to my counsel.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.232
I plan to be.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.042
Everyone in the kitchen
is accounted for?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.177
Save one servant girl, but
Bash, she isn't missing.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.913
Annabelle is young
and madly in love.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.181
She merely skipped out on
work to meet her lover.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.950
They were to elope today.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.252
Delphine was wrong.
Did you ask where
they were meeting?

24:48.254 --> 24:51.589
Where the river narrows
and bends to the East.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.960
Francis has requested
we meet him in the village.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.661
Why?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.597
There's something
you need to see.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.999
(horse sputtering,
crowd chatter)

25:02.001 --> 25:04.568
(chickens clucking)

25:05.938 --> 25:08.806
So, where are we drinking?

25:08.808 --> 25:12.576
Did you arrange to have a
message sent to a Lord Germain?

25:12.578 --> 25:13.844
Never heard of him.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.080
Do you honestly think

25:16.082 --> 25:17.882
we would leave
Catherine unobserved,

25:17.884 --> 25:19.283
free to plot against us?

25:19.285 --> 25:21.018
We made plans for
her imprisonment.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.621
Removed a bit of mortar
from between two old bricks.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.256
A servant on the other
side reports back

25:25.258 --> 25:26.790
on Mother's every move,

25:26.792 --> 25:29.026
every conversation.
You lied.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.961
You have no intention
of marrying me.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.197
Fine. I don't want a wife.
I told you that.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.999
And I sent that message.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.767
But Mother simply
wants to educate me.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.802
I wrote
to Lord Germain in order

25:38.804 --> 25:41.105
to request a full reckoning
of the Crown's accounts.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.909
Well, let me introduce
you to Lord Germain,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.877
and his equally
unsavory peers.
MAN:
Keep moving.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.679
MARY:
Germain is

25:48.681 --> 25:50.114
a trained killer.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.715
That message was code,

25:51.717 --> 25:54.084
code Catherine established
before her exile.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.720
These men were booking
a passage to Navarre.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.256
The Bourbons.

25:59.258 --> 26:03.961
Your message activated a plot to
assassinate their entire line.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.564
Did you know that King
Antoine has children?

26:06.566 --> 26:08.999
A seven-year-old son.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.734
And a newborn baby girl

26:10.736 --> 26:13.170
who does not yet even
understand that she is royalty.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.607
You ordered men to
murder those children.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.576
That blood would have been
on your hands.

26:18.578 --> 26:19.877
MAN:
Keep moving.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.145
MARY:
The first

26:21.147 --> 26:22.913
lesson in an education

26:22.915 --> 26:24.782
from Catherine de Medici.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.185
Is that the kind of
king you want to be?

26:30.656 --> 26:32.623
LOLA:
How was your business
in the village?

26:32.625 --> 26:34.191
MARY:
We'll talk about that later.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.193
In the meantime,
did you actually give in

26:36.195 --> 26:37.895
to Narcisse's advances

26:37.897 --> 26:39.930
after Catherine put a rat
in your bath?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.032
It does sound a bit
foolish in retrospect.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.768
Well, it's beyond me
how she pulled it off.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.203
We've been going
to great lengths

26:46.205 --> 26:48.339
to protect ourselves
from her usual tricks.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.741
Catherine will be dealt with,
I promise you.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.277
But you, Lola--
what were you thinking?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.313
Well, that's just it.
I've<i> stopped</i> thinking.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.817
What possible kind of future
could you two have together?

26:59.819 --> 27:02.319
Catherine is out to
get us, but I trust

27:02.321 --> 27:04.622
that Narcisse will
protect me and my son.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.691
That fierceness, how
he takes what he wants

27:07.693 --> 27:09.393
and gets what he needs--
it's a huge part

27:09.395 --> 27:11.629
of why I feel better
with him at my side.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.031
I have been on the other end
of that fierceness,

27:14.033 --> 27:17.067
and as your friend,
I beg you, be careful.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.902
There's something
I need to share with you,

27:18.904 --> 27:21.305
but it must
stay between us.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.809
Francis wanted to
tell you himself.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.911
But we went to your
chambers this morning,

27:27.913 --> 27:32.016
and your lady said that you
were out picking berries.

27:34.387 --> 27:38.155
Lola, Francis
is very ill.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.658
He's dying.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.994
Oh, God, Mary.
I'm so sorry.

27:43.996 --> 27:48.065
Now you will always be
my friend, but soon,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.334
Francis won't be king.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.337
The last person in the way to
your relationship with Narcisse.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.840
All that matters
right now is you.

27:56.842 --> 28:00.177
You and Francis.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.713
Francis has protected
us all for so long.

28:02.715 --> 28:07.084
It's going to seem like
a very different world

28:07.086 --> 28:10.788
when you are forced to make your
own choices for your future.

28:12.124 --> 28:15.392
Lola, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

28:17.129 --> 28:22.099
I want you to think long and
hard about what it is you want.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.468
And then make the
right decision.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.108
And having heard
her confession

28:31.110 --> 28:32.876
that she both harbored
Catherine de Medici

28:32.878 --> 28:35.813
and lied to our fair queen,
council has passed its judgment.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.282
MAN:
The Lady Donatella is hereby
banished from court.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.250
She and her husband
Lord Barlow are

28:40.252 --> 28:43.987
to be stripped of their titles
and relieved of all assets.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.290
Pending Her Majesty's
agreement.

28:46.292 --> 28:50.094
Even friendship with a queen
cannot shield a traitor.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.832
Your Majesty, there's
still the matter

28:54.834 --> 28:56.767
of the French
ambassadorship.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.035
Should we continue
our discussion

28:58.037 --> 28:59.503
of Lord Dudley's
qualifications?

29:01.140 --> 29:03.907
Yes. Let's.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.909
It is my opinion that

29:05.911 --> 29:08.512
Lord Dudley is... not the man
for the job.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.248
He's highly inexperienced

29:11.250 --> 29:12.850
in international
relations,

29:12.852 --> 29:15.352
has a poor knowledge of
French customs at court,

29:15.354 --> 29:17.988
and has been unable
to prove to his queen that

29:17.990 --> 29:19.456
he possesses the finesse

29:19.458 --> 29:21.325
to complete such an
essential peacekeeping mission.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.494
We'll discuss
alternative candidates

29:23.496 --> 29:24.995
at tomorrow's session.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.897
MAN:
Your Majesty.

29:32.972 --> 29:36.807
You just belittled me
in front of your entire court.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.410
Robert?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.553
DONATELLA:
I'm a pauper?
Banished from court?!

29:49.555 --> 29:51.421
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea

29:51.423 --> 29:53.090
the council would
punish you so harshly.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.825
My husband's
livelihood is here.

29:54.827 --> 29:58.162
He'll be forced to start over
with no title, no lands.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.097
Elizabeth,
you promised to protect me.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.899
And I tried my best.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.534
Take comfort
in the fact

30:03.536 --> 30:05.302
that you've helped your
country avoid an international

30:05.304 --> 30:08.105
powder keg
and saved your friend's skin.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.573
I lied because you needed me to

30:09.575 --> 30:11.975
but also because
I had no real choice, did I?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.844
There's always a choice.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.047
I'll recant.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.586
I'll tell the truth.

30:22.588 --> 30:26.557
I'll say that you forced me to
take the fall for your mistake.

30:26.559 --> 30:30.427
Please... don't
do this, not you.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.995
What choice do I have?

30:31.997 --> 30:34.565
You're right.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.466
You don't deserve
any of this.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.536
I'll see to it that
you and Lord Barlow have

30:39.538 --> 30:41.572
all the gold you
need to start over.

30:41.574 --> 30:44.041
The council
never need know.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.610
But you shouldn't linger
at court a moment longer.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.413
Thank you, Your Majesty.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.081
Thank you.

30:59.091 --> 31:02.559
Lady Donatella is making
her way back to her chambers.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.629
Tell the guards
to arrest her at once.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.965
She's threatened
the queen of England,

31:07.967 --> 31:09.900
and is guilty of treason.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.903
Do see to it that the tower
permits her to keep her head.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.378
Where's Francis?
Resting.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.013
Today took too much
out of him.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.082
You're going to have
to do this by yourself.

31:25.084 --> 31:28.652
Come with me. Please.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.922
Is it true?

31:31.924 --> 31:34.591
Did I order the assassination
of an entire family?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.960
You should never have known
about this.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.962
I was trying to protect you
without burdening

31:38.964 --> 31:41.932
your sweet young conscience.
By slaughtering

31:41.934 --> 31:43.066
an entire line.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.269
I was
protecting you.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.304
The Bourbons must die.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.973
I would have been responsible
for the deaths of babies.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.542
To eliminate a succession
threat, a family tree

31:52.544 --> 31:55.145
must be pulled out
from its roots.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.580
And that means children,

31:56.582 --> 31:59.449
no matter how unpalatable.
Do you have any memories

31:59.451 --> 32:01.485
of being ushered
from your chambers
in the middle of the night?

32:01.487 --> 32:04.121
Packed into a guarded room
with your brothers and sisters,

32:04.123 --> 32:06.623
forced to play quietly
for no apparent reason?

32:06.625 --> 32:08.058
Or perhaps you heard

32:08.060 --> 32:11.128
about the siege
that was waged against us

32:11.130 --> 32:12.996
just recently.
Do you know who's responsible

32:12.998 --> 32:15.232
for that near coup?
MARY:
I warn you.

32:15.234 --> 32:18.969
We are doing our best
to allow you to keep your head.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.938
Our own castle
has been under attack,

32:20.940 --> 32:22.673
and my children
have been threatened.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.408
And that is how far
the Bourbons are willing to go

32:24.410 --> 32:27.244
to take out our line
and to take our power.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.514
Maybe they would kill us all.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.150
That doesn't make it right.
Who cares

32:33.152 --> 32:35.218
about right or wrong
if you're dead?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.394
He knows I speak the truth.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.430
You've lost, Mary.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.001
I've just been
to your chambers.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.003
I needed to make
sure that Catherine

32:53.005 --> 32:55.505
hadn't left any
more surprises.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.008
But you're safe.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.410
We are safe.

33:00.412 --> 33:04.114
So many people,
even my closest friends,

33:04.116 --> 33:05.983
see only one side of you.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.152
But I've seen something
different, something I need.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.021
You were right.

33:11.023 --> 33:14.091
There's more than a fleeting
affair between us.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.093
Stephan,

33:16.095 --> 33:17.661
I love you, too.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.997
And I want it all.

33:19.999 --> 33:23.667
We will find our way
to a true union somehow.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.202
Marriage?

33:25.204 --> 33:27.471
Has Francis changed his mind?
No.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.474
But if you can just be patient,

33:30.476 --> 33:32.476
trust me,

33:32.478 --> 33:35.012
I promise
we'll both get what we want.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.347
¶ I need you right here
with me ¶

33:37.349 --> 33:40.150
¶ Here with me ¶

33:44.189 --> 33:46.056
(door opens, shuts)

33:46.058 --> 33:48.058
Stop.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.260
I won't be needing you
to pay any more visits

33:50.262 --> 33:53.196
to Lady Lola's chamber.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.667
I've got what I wanted.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.804
Now it's time to become the man
who deserves it.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.709
DUDLEY:
<i> The queen of England herself</i>
<i> has dubbed me a "highly</i>

34:05.711 --> 34:07.711
inexperienced" fool.
The other nobles

34:07.713 --> 34:10.347
are questioning
my mere presence on the council.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.483
I lost a friend today, someone
I've known since we were girls!

34:13.485 --> 34:15.419
I can't
lose you, too.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.821
To France. To an advancement.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.823
I did it for us,

34:19.825 --> 34:21.625
to keep you here.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.460
Because that's
what you want.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.463
You took what you want without
a thought for my reputation,

34:26.465 --> 34:28.565
for my future.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.769
I can't do this
anymore, Elizabeth.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.771
I can raise your station,

34:34.773 --> 34:36.606
by other means,
in ways

34:36.608 --> 34:39.109
no one can defy.
I just need time.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.445
Is this even a promise
you believe?

34:44.216 --> 34:46.083
Sometimes I wonder.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.086
It's not my promises
that are the problem.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.856
It's the one you made
when you married your wife.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.859
Your station
we can deal with,

34:55.861 --> 34:58.361
but what do we do
about Amy?

34:58.363 --> 35:00.363
Admit it.

35:00.365 --> 35:03.133
You focus
on all the other obstacles,

35:03.135 --> 35:06.269
because you have created
the greatest one!

35:06.271 --> 35:10.207
It's true. But after the
hundredth time you said we would

35:10.209 --> 35:12.175
never marry,
I wed another.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.211
And Amy's not going anywhere,
is she?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.712
I don't know.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.181
You tell me.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.684
Elizabeth.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.621
Be careful what you say,

35:24.623 --> 35:27.157
what you want.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.430
(horse sputters, neighs)

35:52.251 --> 35:54.918
(flies buzzing)

36:00.325 --> 36:02.626
(grunts)

36:13.872 --> 36:16.439
(door opens)

36:18.210 --> 36:19.743
Where have
you been?

36:19.745 --> 36:22.212
The nursery.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.182
The Bourbons are our enemies.
I believe that.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.584
Do you know who else might
be considered a usurper?

36:27.586 --> 36:30.187
John, the king's
illegitimate son.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.588
Bash, our brother.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.923
Should we kill
them, too?

36:32.925 --> 36:34.424
What's right and
wrong does matter

36:34.426 --> 36:35.759
to me.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.761
I thought
I could trust our mother.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.296
That maybe you'd overreached

36:39.298 --> 36:41.431
by tossing her
in that cell.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.933
She's not the mother
I thought she was.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.634
She can't be a
mother at all.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.436
Not-not to a king.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.506
Secure your rule
by building up your nation

36:49.508 --> 36:52.509
rather than cutting down
your rivals,

36:52.511 --> 36:55.812
and you will make France
want you as her leader.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.515
Your brother has
already set this example.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.584
Let me help you follow it.

37:00.586 --> 37:04.254
I would be honored if you would
agree to be my wife.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.356
And this time I mean it.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.326
The honor is mine.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.800
(door opens)

37:16.802 --> 37:19.669
(door shuts)

37:19.671 --> 37:22.505
He's going to need you, Mary.

37:22.507 --> 37:26.243
Is this really happening?

37:26.245 --> 37:28.411
Am I really planning a life,

37:28.413 --> 37:30.780
a future without you?

37:35.554 --> 37:37.654
(sniffles)

37:37.656 --> 37:40.023
Who's there?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.927
Trouble sleeping?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.862
I won't remind
you why.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.865
I don't wish to be the target
of your working man's wrath.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.301
Not again.

37:51.303 --> 37:52.969
I went looking for your blanket,

37:52.971 --> 37:54.337
to no avail.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.673
Frederick, the
old steward,

37:56.675 --> 37:58.275
told me it was a gift
from King Henry.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.576
Why didn't
you tell me?

37:59.578 --> 38:01.845
I heard you talking
with Charles.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.546
I know Francis is dying.

38:03.548 --> 38:06.283
You mustn't tell anyone.
I won't.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.285
Francis is my friend.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.854
His secrets will always be safe
with me,

38:10.856 --> 38:13.857
but I know that losing him
leaves you vulnerable.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.726
My father always promised me
I could marry for love.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.561
In the end,
I suppose

38:18.563 --> 38:20.030
he wasn't much of a father
at all.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.498
He was ill,
Claude.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.533
He went mad.
Yes.
But...

38:23.535 --> 38:27.537
I try to remember a time
when he doted on me,

38:27.539 --> 38:29.639
when I was his favorite.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.975
I was
protected.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.777
Now there's...

38:33.779 --> 38:35.979
no one left to protect me.

38:37.582 --> 38:41.451
I'll stay here
until you drift off.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.553
For as long as it takes.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.457
(clears throat)

38:50.095 --> 38:52.629
I can't sleep.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.731
But maybe if you talk to me.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.334
Talk?

38:58.670 --> 39:02.072
Surely the banalities
of your daily life

39:02.074 --> 39:04.441
are enough
to make anyone drowsy.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.612
I need you, Nicholas.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.582
I've retired
from your service.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.357
When I rewarded you
for your allegiance,

39:20.359 --> 39:22.492
I'd hoped it would inspire you
to more.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.394
I suppose I'd had my fill
of lying.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.797
(chuckles)
A luxury a queen
can never afford.

39:27.799 --> 39:31.634
But now I need an operative
with your special skills.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.636
What do you want from me?

39:33.638 --> 39:36.639
You have a talent for espionage

39:36.641 --> 39:40.076
and can still fit in
with the most erudite at court.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.612
Queen Mary
will trust you.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.381
France?

39:44.383 --> 39:47.083
Pack your things.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.152
I've appointed you
the new English ambassador.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.626
(key jangling)

40:03.535 --> 40:06.669
I came to tell you another
of your sons has eagerly agreed

40:06.671 --> 40:08.104
to take me as his queen,

40:08.106 --> 40:09.973
through no agenda
of his own,

40:09.975 --> 40:13.843
merely a desire for my counsel,
despite your best efforts.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.112
A traitor should always pay
with their life.

40:16.114 --> 40:19.082
But Francis was forced
to kill one parent.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.784
No one could ask him
to endure the pain

40:20.786 --> 40:22.986
of being responsible
for the death of another.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.121
How charitable of you, daughter.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.123
Charles
is impressionable.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.592
He values the advice
of those he trusts.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.594
One might make
the case

40:31.596 --> 40:34.197
that dispatching you would be
for the good of the realm.

40:34.199 --> 40:37.734
And our young king might be
more willing than Francis

40:37.736 --> 40:41.004
to make that most terrible
of sacrifices.

40:41.006 --> 40:44.140
I want to talk to Francis. Now.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.576
Don't think of crossing us
again.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.111
Do you hear me?

40:48.113 --> 40:51.681
I want my son!

40:52.617 --> 40:54.617
I want to see the king now!

40:54.619 --> 40:57.120
(shouts)

40:57.122 --> 40:59.589
I want the king!

40:59.591 --> 41:01.891
(panting)

41:01.893 --> 41:04.561
(shouting)

41:08.967 --> 41:12.068
