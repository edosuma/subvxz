00:07.074 --> 00:13.144
¶ ¶

00:16.449 --> 00:19.516
Thank you.
Have a good day.

00:19.518 --> 00:22.352
We've landed, sir.

00:22.354 --> 00:24.554
We've arrived in
los angeles, sir.

00:25.757 --> 00:27.189
Excuse me, sir.

00:27.191 --> 00:29.257
Hello?

00:30.293 --> 00:31.558
Sir?

00:31.560 --> 00:34.561
Can you hear me?

00:41.536 --> 00:44.537
I'm sorry.
You were sound asleep.

00:44.539 --> 00:45.804
We've landed.

00:45.806 --> 00:47.372
Thank you.

00:47.374 --> 00:49.440
Let's go.

01:00.218 --> 01:02.351
Thank you, sir.

01:05.189 --> 01:07.822
Supposed to be somebody here
from ncis here to get him.

01:09.225 --> 01:10.691
Nobody here yet.

01:13.829 --> 01:15.495
Take the hat off,
look into the camera

01:15.497 --> 01:16.796
And place your right hand
on the scanner.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.336
Take your hand off the scanner.

01:26.672 --> 01:27.637
Try again.

01:27.639 --> 01:30.573
Is there a problem?

01:32.643 --> 01:35.610
Biometrics don't match.
This isn't his passport.

01:35.612 --> 01:37.677
Of course it's his passport.

01:39.781 --> 01:41.380
Look.

01:41.382 --> 01:43.582
Then you got the wrong guy.

01:46.486 --> 01:49.687
Wait.
Who the hell are you?

02:12.578 --> 02:14.644
¶ ¶

02:20.551 --> 02:21.850
Deeks.

02:21.852 --> 02:24.118
What are you doing in there?
Hurry up.

02:25.654 --> 02:27.720
Geez, it's like he's
shaving his legs or something.

02:30.658 --> 02:32.557
Is there a, uh,
is there a problem?

02:32.559 --> 02:34.725
Yeah, the problem is my partner
takes longer

02:34.727 --> 02:37.527
Than the average
kardashian to get ready.

02:37.529 --> 02:39.562
Well, you, uh,
you need a workout partner?

02:39.564 --> 02:41.664
(laughs)

02:41.666 --> 02:44.066
What?
Really?

02:44.067 --> 02:46.467
Yeah.
You want to... You, um, you
want to be a part of this?

02:46.470 --> 02:48.336
Yeah, I want
to be a part of this.

02:48.338 --> 02:51.539
Daddy wants
to be a part of this.

02:51.541 --> 02:53.140
Let's do this.

02:53.142 --> 02:55.208
(grunting)

02:58.746 --> 03:00.445
(whoops)
you okay?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.713
Yeah. Not exactly
what I had in mind, but...

03:02.715 --> 03:04.681
Oh. Do you, uh,
think I should I be wearing

03:04.683 --> 03:06.416
Some kind
of protective headgear?

03:06.418 --> 03:07.650
Want me to kick you
in the head?

03:07.652 --> 03:10.386
Not particularly.
Okay.

03:10.388 --> 03:11.754
Oh, lord.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.556
Christmas
came early.

03:14.558 --> 03:16.291
Samuel. Sam-dawg.

03:16.293 --> 03:17.859
Hey. You know,
we're just finishing up.

03:17.861 --> 03:19.594
So you guys, uh, you can...

03:19.596 --> 03:21.562
(chuckles)
oh, no, no, no.
I want to play whack-a-beale.

03:21.564 --> 03:23.614
Yeah. Kensi?

03:23.615 --> 03:25.665
You wanted to train with us.
This is training with us.

03:25.668 --> 03:28.435
I do-I do want to train
with you, but, you know,

03:28.437 --> 03:30.236
I just reali...
That, um, granger wants me

03:30.238 --> 03:31.870
Up in ops.
Oh, no, come here.

03:31.872 --> 03:33.771
No, no, kensi. Oh.
Come on.

03:33.773 --> 03:36.306
You can do it.
Y... Okay.

03:36.308 --> 03:37.607
Eric.
Come on, come on,
ten minutes.

03:37.609 --> 03:39.675
Hey, come on.
(laughs)

03:42.446 --> 03:44.379
That was mean.
Oh, no.

03:44.381 --> 03:45.780
That was fun.

03:45.782 --> 03:47.749
Where's deeks?

03:47.750 --> 03:49.717
Deeks has been in the locker
room for about half an hour now.

03:49.719 --> 03:50.951
I'm sorry I asked.

03:50.953 --> 03:52.870
Where's callen?

03:52.871 --> 03:54.788
He had something to do
with joelle, apparently.
Ooh.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.356
Do I sense trouble in paradise?

03:56.358 --> 03:57.790
I don't know.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.792
Just got a bad feeling
it's gonna happen.

03:59.794 --> 04:01.426
Why do you say that?
You don't like her?

04:01.428 --> 04:04.862
Oh, no, I like her.
I actually set them up.

04:04.864 --> 04:07.531
Now I'm wondering
if it was a mistake.
Aw.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.667
You starting to miss him?
Huh? (laughs)

04:10.669 --> 04:14.504
Oh, don't tell me
he's putting hos before bros.

04:14.506 --> 04:15.605
How many relationships
have you had

04:15.607 --> 04:16.706
That worked out
while doing this?

04:16.708 --> 04:19.208
(grunts)
well, there was, uh...

04:19.210 --> 04:21.376
Oh, no, he
wasn't... Um...

04:21.378 --> 04:22.643
Yeah.

04:22.645 --> 04:23.977
Exactly.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.578
I like joelle,
so does callen.

04:25.580 --> 04:26.879
I don't think
she can handle it.

04:26.881 --> 04:28.714
This job is a cruel mistress.

04:28.716 --> 04:32.584
Fortunately, I know how
to handle my cruel mistress.

04:32.586 --> 04:34.352
What the hell
are you wearing?

04:34.354 --> 04:35.753
What do you mean,
what the hell am I wearing?

04:35.755 --> 04:37.788
I'm wearing a track suit.
That is a jumpsuit.

04:37.790 --> 04:40.991
That's a unitard.
Some kind of tard.

04:40.993 --> 04:42.859
You don't recognize this?

04:42.861 --> 04:45.695
Yeah, uma thurman wore
the same thing in<i> kill bill.</i>

04:45.697 --> 04:46.962
Oh, my gosh, don't

04:46.964 --> 04:48.463
Tell me you're cross-dressing.

04:48.465 --> 04:50.382
The one that
uma thurman wore

04:50.383 --> 04:52.300
Was different, but it was also
an homage to the original,

04:52.302 --> 04:54.869
Which was worn
by the greatest martial artist

04:54.871 --> 04:57.271
The world has ever known.

04:57.273 --> 05:00.741
Seriously, nothing?
Bruce lee!

05:00.743 --> 05:03.810
The dragon himself. This is
classic jeet kune do fight gear.

05:03.812 --> 05:06.279
Since when do you
do jeet kune do?
Well, kensilina,

05:06.281 --> 05:07.680
I'll have you know that,
a lot like batman,

05:07.682 --> 05:09.815
My unique combat skills
come from a variety

05:09.817 --> 05:12.284
Of fighting styles,
which is jeet kune do,

05:12.286 --> 05:13.785
Aikido, tae kwon do.

05:13.787 --> 05:15.353
Curly, larry, moe.

05:15.355 --> 05:16.787
Oh, you know, I see what's
happening here-- you're

05:16.789 --> 05:17.988
Mocking me, which
is interesting,

05:17.990 --> 05:19.389
Because when you mock me,

05:19.391 --> 05:20.790
You mock my brother bruce lee,

05:20.792 --> 05:22.591
Which seems a little bit racist

05:22.593 --> 05:25.427
And I'd actually expect
more coming from you.
Keep it up,

05:25.429 --> 05:27.362
You're gonna get a lot
more from me.
Oh, yeah?

05:27.364 --> 05:30.832
Yeah, really.
You familiar with the,
uh, game of death?

05:30.834 --> 05:32.834
Oh, yeah.
I play it to win.

05:32.836 --> 05:34.769
Well, don't make me
unleash the dragon.

05:34.771 --> 05:36.937
Please, somebody needs
to train his dragon.

05:36.939 --> 05:38.505
Bring it on.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.007
Where have you been?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
Uh, just working out
with sam and kensi.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.909
Really?

05:44.911 --> 05:46.644
Yeah. Sparring, mostly.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.278
I'd pay to see that.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.812
Yeah. So, um,
you wanted to see me?

05:49.814 --> 05:52.447
I want you to find
any new information you can

05:52.449 --> 05:56.284
On this internal affairs
investigation deeks is part of.

05:56.286 --> 05:57.918
And where would I look
for something like that?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.853
If I knew that
I would have done it myself.

05:59.855 --> 06:02.722
You're the cyberpunk,
you figure it out.

06:02.724 --> 06:04.557
I prefer cyberstud.

06:04.559 --> 06:05.925
(computer beeping)

06:07.662 --> 06:09.028
Perimeter alert.

06:09.030 --> 06:10.796
Someone at the carport.

06:10.798 --> 06:12.798
Punch it up.

06:14.802 --> 06:16.301
Who is that?

06:16.303 --> 06:18.002
Hello? Anybody home?

06:18.004 --> 06:20.838
Do I need a secret password
or something?

06:31.316 --> 06:33.783
You know, we don't
have to do this now, hetty.

06:33.785 --> 06:36.485
Nonsense,
this is a pleasure for me.

06:36.487 --> 06:37.819
All right.

06:37.821 --> 06:41.389
Reminds me
of when I was

06:41.391 --> 06:45.025
Working on
<i>the lion in winter</i> with hepburn

06:45.027 --> 06:48.395
And o'toole
and a young anthony hopkins.

06:48.397 --> 06:50.663
Wow. Mm.
Oh, my.

06:50.665 --> 06:53.599
Well, it's just beautiful.

06:54.902 --> 06:56.401
Thank you.

06:56.403 --> 06:59.604
Have you ever been
to a renaissance fair?

06:59.606 --> 07:03.407
Uh, the society
for creative anachronism

07:03.409 --> 07:05.375
Is what we called
it in my day.

07:05.377 --> 07:07.977
Mm. Well, eric's practically

07:07.979 --> 07:09.778
A celebrity at these things,

07:09.780 --> 07:13.348
So I figured I might as well
at least try and look the part.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.417
You will make
a most fetching wench.

07:16.419 --> 07:18.018
Thank you?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.652
Kensi:
Hey, what's the emergency?

07:19.654 --> 07:21.654
Yeah, I got an alert
from beale.
Maybe it's revenge

07:21.656 --> 07:23.122
For the beating kensi gave him.

07:23.124 --> 07:24.490
You beat up beale?

07:24.492 --> 07:25.858
No. No.
Little bit.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.392
What's happening, beale?

07:27.394 --> 07:28.593
Yeah, we got a...

07:28.595 --> 07:30.528
Pardon me, your grace.

07:30.530 --> 07:32.396
My lord.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.831
We got company.

07:37.769 --> 07:39.368
Ah, wow.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.036
So this is the secret lair

07:41.038 --> 07:43.505
Of the west coast avengers.
I always wondered.

07:43.507 --> 07:45.406
I'm special agent tony...

07:45.408 --> 07:47.074
Dinozzo, yes.

07:47.076 --> 07:49.509
You must be hetty.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.411
And you must be in trouble.

07:52.413 --> 07:55.113
Well, y-yeah.
A little bit.

07:55.115 --> 07:56.948
Assistant director granger.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.149
Dinozzo.

07:58.151 --> 08:01.018
Agent hanna and blye.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.419
Hi.

08:02.421 --> 08:03.586
Lapd detective deeks.

08:03.588 --> 08:04.687
Sup?

08:04.689 --> 08:06.455
It's nice to see you, uma.

08:06.457 --> 08:08.957
Bruce lee, actually.
Bruce lee wore it first.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.858
And this is technical operator
eric beale

08:10.860 --> 08:14.027
And intel analyst
nell jones.
Hi.

08:14.029 --> 08:16.162
I love the cape.

08:16.164 --> 08:18.164
Clearly, I've missed something.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.399
Agent callen,
agent dinozzo

08:20.401 --> 08:21.600
From washington.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.501
He was just about to tell us

08:23.503 --> 08:25.970
To what we owe the pleasure
of his visit.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.806
I'm here to pick up a prisoner
flying in from singapore.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.475
Only the guy that I went
to the airport to pick up

08:31.477 --> 08:33.076
Was not the prisoner
from singapore.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.144
I hate
when that happens.
Yeah. Somehow

08:35.146 --> 08:37.012
He gave the marshal the slip

08:37.014 --> 08:38.980
In-flight and now
he is in the wind.
Hm.

08:38.982 --> 08:40.481
Sam:
You lost your prisoner?

08:40.483 --> 08:41.915
I didn't lose anybody.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.883
He was already lost
when I got to the airport.

08:43.885 --> 08:45.084
Deeks:
Semantics.

08:45.086 --> 08:47.152
So who is he?

08:47.154 --> 08:50.488
His name is rio syamsundin.

08:50.490 --> 08:51.422
Aka wei wong,

08:51.424 --> 08:52.823
Aka joshua santos,

08:52.825 --> 08:56.059
Aka hiroshi sato,
aka hoang nguyen.

08:56.061 --> 08:58.461
Tony:
That's my fave.

08:58.463 --> 08:59.862
He's got great hair.
Thanks for the assist.

08:59.864 --> 09:02.497
Rio is suspected
of laundering money

09:02.499 --> 09:04.065
For a number of criminal
organizations,

09:04.067 --> 09:05.433
But no one's
ever been able

09:05.435 --> 09:07.134
To nail him,
in part because he's

09:07.136 --> 09:08.568
Constantly assuming
different identities

09:08.570 --> 09:10.169
And citizenships.

09:10.171 --> 09:11.770
He also does his banking
from a yacht

09:11.772 --> 09:14.873
In the international waters
of the asian pacific.
Wow,

09:14.875 --> 09:16.758
My guidance counselor
didn't tell me that was

09:16.759 --> 09:18.642
A career option.
I would have studied for that.
Well, for some reason

09:18.645 --> 09:20.478
He showed himself in singapore

09:20.480 --> 09:22.646
And that's when he got grabbed.
Because we have a

09:22.648 --> 09:26.449
Special relationship
with spf, we had first dibs.

09:26.451 --> 09:28.751
We had a u.S. Marshal
flying him into l.A.

09:28.753 --> 09:31.153
And I was gonna pick him up
and fly him back to dc.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.522
And what happened?
The marshal has no idea.

09:33.524 --> 09:35.891
Says he had the right guy
when he got on the plane.

09:35.893 --> 09:38.226
A guy with his money
can buy an escape plan, easy.

09:38.228 --> 09:40.728
He hires a look-alike,
takes the same plane.

09:40.730 --> 09:43.197
Kensi:<i> And if the double</i>
<i> has a seat in another section</i>

09:43.199 --> 09:45.666
<i>Of the aircraft he's just gonna</i>
<i> look like any other passenger.</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:48.535
Callen:
<i> Rio probably had a flight</i>
<i> attendant on the payroll, too.</i>

09:48.537 --> 09:51.471
<i> If they slip something into</i>
<i> the marshal's food or drinks,</i>

09:51.473 --> 09:54.040
<i>It would only be matter of time</i>
<i> before he was out cold.</i>

09:54.042 --> 09:55.641
<i> To everyone around him,</i>

09:55.643 --> 09:58.543
<i> It would just</i>
<i> look like he's sleeping.</i>

09:58.545 --> 10:00.011
Deeks:
<i> Once the marshal's out,</i>
<i> our fugitive rio</i>

10:00.013 --> 10:01.712
<i> Is free to move</i>
<i> about the cabin, so he</i>

10:01.714 --> 10:03.213
<i> Heads to the lavatory,</i>
<i> where an accomplice</i>

10:03.215 --> 10:05.515
<i> Is waiting with everything</i>
<i> he needs to disappear.</i>

10:05.517 --> 10:07.950
<i> A change of clothes,</i>
<i> new identification documents</i>

10:07.952 --> 10:10.585
<i> And, most importantly,</i>
<i> a handcuff key.</i>

10:10.587 --> 10:14.055
Callen:
<i> Rio frees himself, puts on his</i>
<i> wardrobe, then switches seats.</i>

10:14.057 --> 10:17.158
<i> Double dresses rio's clothes</i>
<i> and handcuffs himself</i>

10:17.160 --> 10:19.560
<i> Before taking rio's seat</i>
<i> with the marshal,</i>

10:19.562 --> 10:21.929
<i> Who has slept</i>
<i> through the entire switch.</i>

10:21.931 --> 10:23.230
Deeks:
<i> And the real rio</i>

10:23.232 --> 10:25.031
Walks off the plane a free man.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.232
That's how I'd do it.

10:26.234 --> 10:29.201
Huh.
That's pretty good.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.069
Well, the bottom line
is that rio

10:31.071 --> 10:33.288
Is a gold mine of information

10:33.289 --> 10:35.506
About criminal organizations
and their finances.

10:35.508 --> 10:38.075
And if he cooperates in exchange
for a lenient sentence,

10:38.077 --> 10:41.611
We can shut down billions
in terrorist funding overnight.

10:41.613 --> 10:43.663
What happened to the
guy he switched with?

10:43.664 --> 10:45.714
He is being held by homeland
at the airport.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.216
Well, let's transfer him
to the boatshed.

10:47.218 --> 10:49.585
What's the boatshed?

10:49.587 --> 10:50.252
That's classified.

10:50.254 --> 10:51.253
Kensi:
It's where we

10:51.255 --> 10:52.654
Interrogate suspects

10:52.656 --> 10:54.522
To keep this place off
the radar.

10:54.524 --> 10:56.757
Oh. How hardy boys of you.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.158
Granger:
This guy's a high-value target.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.592
Not only does he know where

10:59.594 --> 11:00.926
The money comes from
and where it goes.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.093
He also knows all the players.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.595
And none of them wants him
in our hands.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.296
You need to be careful.
Callen:
All right.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.864
How do you want to do this?

11:07.866 --> 11:09.532
Well, I don't care how we do it.

11:09.534 --> 11:10.699
I just need to find him fast.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.100
Eric, nell, why
don't you see

11:12.102 --> 11:14.035
What you can get out
of airport security?

11:14.037 --> 11:15.770
Find out where he went,
or at least who

11:15.772 --> 11:17.204
Picked him up
and what name

11:17.206 --> 11:19.539
He's travelling
under right now.
Sam:
If rio's working

11:19.541 --> 11:22.041
The pacific rim, he's probably
got contacts along the coast.

11:22.043 --> 11:24.610
Hopefully in l.A.
Deeks:
Kensi and I will

11:24.612 --> 11:26.545
Track down some leads,
and I'll talk to lapd

11:26.547 --> 11:28.213
To see if this guy has
any links in town.

11:28.215 --> 11:30.815
Let's do it.

11:32.785 --> 11:34.785
Mr. Dinozzo,

11:34.787 --> 11:36.920
A moment.

11:36.922 --> 11:39.722
We'll wait
for you outside.

11:39.724 --> 11:42.624
Whatever you do,
don't look her in the eye.

11:42.626 --> 11:45.093
Let her smell
your hand first.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.695
(sniffing)

11:51.333 --> 11:54.634
Is washington aware
of what's happened?

11:54.636 --> 11:57.803
Ah. Um, well,
I was actually...

11:57.805 --> 11:59.671
No.

11:59.673 --> 12:01.972
No.

12:03.942 --> 12:05.942
Your last visit

12:05.944 --> 12:09.645
To los angeles
didn't go very well.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.647
It could have
gone better.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.349
Director shepard was murdered.

12:14.351 --> 12:16.351
<i> Much</i> better.

12:16.353 --> 12:21.655
How long before gibbs
is expecting you to check in?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.189
Not long enough.

12:23.191 --> 12:24.857
Actually, uh, we are supposed

12:24.859 --> 12:28.060
To be on the 237
back to d.C., so...

12:35.035 --> 12:37.702
Oh. Mm.

12:37.704 --> 12:39.704
Um...

12:39.706 --> 12:43.040
So?

12:43.042 --> 12:44.908
So, I suggest you get moving.

12:44.910 --> 12:48.678
This fugitive isn't going
to find himself.

12:49.647 --> 12:52.314
How very true.

12:52.316 --> 12:54.716
Thank you for that.

13:02.392 --> 13:04.625
Tunnel.

13:04.627 --> 13:06.693
Tunnel. Of course.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.194
What's a bat cave
without a tunnel?

13:12.400 --> 13:16.402
Godspeed, agent dinozzo.

13:22.142 --> 13:24.275
Tony (laughing):
Wow.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.844
This is very<i> lost boys.</i> Wow.

13:26.846 --> 13:29.746
So, it's more
the peter pan variety

13:29.748 --> 13:31.914
Than the, uh, two coreys
with the vampires.

13:31.916 --> 13:33.782
You guys have
a tree house?

13:33.784 --> 13:35.116
Marshall?

13:35.118 --> 13:37.118
Gentlemen.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.352
Who's the woman?

13:38.354 --> 13:40.020
It's his lawyer.
Lawyer.

13:40.022 --> 13:41.421
You let him make a phone call?
No.

13:41.423 --> 13:44.123
She showed up
at the airport about

13:44.125 --> 13:46.091
Ten minutes
after you left.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.192
Sam:
Clearly, your boy

13:47.194 --> 13:49.260
Rio has put some
thought into this.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.428
Callen:
Why don't you two take

13:51.430 --> 13:53.363
A crack at him, I'll speak
with the marshal here.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.998
Sam, I assume
you're gonna want to be bad cop.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.699
Why'd you say that?

13:57.701 --> 14:00.768
'cause of the role-playing.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.136
Role playing?

14:03.138 --> 14:04.837
Yeah, you know.

14:04.839 --> 14:06.271
Your undercover work.

14:06.273 --> 14:08.239
I understand that
you adopt these personas, and...

14:08.241 --> 14:10.241
(laughs)
he's very method.

14:10.243 --> 14:12.309
Mm.

14:13.345 --> 14:15.745
Special agent sam hanna,

14:15.747 --> 14:17.780
Special agent dinozzo.

14:17.782 --> 14:19.782
Miss...?

14:19.784 --> 14:21.450
Attorney.
Sarah taylor.

14:21.452 --> 14:23.051
This is my client,
mr. Hung.

14:23.053 --> 14:25.420
Well, hung...

14:25.422 --> 14:26.721
Looks like

14:26.723 --> 14:27.755
You're in trouble.

14:27.757 --> 14:29.473
Sam:
Your client

14:29.474 --> 14:31.190
Have any idea
where his buddy rio went?

14:31.193 --> 14:32.859
My client was
wrongfully arrested

14:32.861 --> 14:34.794
In a case of mistaken identity,

14:34.796 --> 14:36.128
Kidnapped from his country

14:36.130 --> 14:39.064
And brought here
against his own will, so,

14:39.066 --> 14:41.066
Unless he is released
immediately,

14:41.068 --> 14:43.935
We will be filing a lawsuit
against the u.S. Government

14:43.937 --> 14:47.238
And issuing a statement
to the press about his illegal

14:47.240 --> 14:49.206
Extraordinary rendition.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.208
Sam:
Your client aided
and abetted

14:51.210 --> 14:52.776
The escape of a criminal linked

14:52.778 --> 14:55.112
To several
terrorist organizations.

14:55.113 --> 14:57.447
My client has no criminal record
and has done nothing wrong.

14:57.449 --> 14:58.481
And like I said,
he was kidnapped...

14:58.483 --> 14:59.849
Tony:
How did you know

14:59.851 --> 15:01.483
Your client was in l.A.?

15:01.485 --> 15:03.785
That's privileged
information.

15:03.787 --> 15:05.887
We'll subpoena
your phone records,

15:05.889 --> 15:09.824
Find out whoever contacted you
prior to mr. Hung's arrival.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.859
Then we get your
bank statements,

15:11.861 --> 15:14.962
Trace any records of deposits
from offshore accounts,

15:14.964 --> 15:16.830
Both of which will link you

15:16.832 --> 15:18.765
To our missing
fugitive.
Tony: Then you become

15:18.767 --> 15:21.334
A lawyer in need
of a lawyer.

15:21.335 --> 15:23.902
You think your patriot act
trumps the sixth amendment?

15:23.905 --> 15:26.839
I think justice
trumps terrorism.

15:26.841 --> 15:28.841
Gentlemen, you may
enforce the law,

15:28.843 --> 15:30.409
But the legal system
is my world,

15:30.411 --> 15:32.744
So, let's just
cut the crap.

15:32.746 --> 15:34.746
You got nothing on my client.

15:34.748 --> 15:36.481
You know it, I know it.

15:36.483 --> 15:39.484
And unless you want the world
to know it, we're out of here.

15:39.486 --> 15:43.521
You familiar with the<i> united</i>
<i> states versus ahmed abdel,</i>

15:43.523 --> 15:45.422
<i> Lynne stewart,</i>
<i> and mohammed yousry?</i>

15:45.424 --> 15:47.524
That's the one where
the lawyer gets charged

15:47.526 --> 15:50.860
With aiding the terrorists
she was defending.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.062
I believe in that case,

15:53.064 --> 15:55.898
She served eight years?
No, ten.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.165
Ten? I was gonna
say "eight."

15:57.167 --> 15:58.432
Actually, I did
say "eight."

15:58.434 --> 16:00.767
Overruled. Can you imagine
a whole decade

16:00.769 --> 16:03.369
Without pilates,
prada and... Botox?

16:04.138 --> 16:05.237
Sam:
We'll give you some time

16:05.239 --> 16:07.239
To sit with that.

16:07.241 --> 16:09.174
(footsteps retreating)

16:09.176 --> 16:10.942
All right.
Thanks, nell.

16:10.944 --> 16:14.078
You didn't take anything to help
you sleep on the plane, did you?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.547
Of course not.
Didn't think so,
but I had to ask.

16:16.549 --> 16:18.882
Your blood work came back,
and you tested positive

16:18.884 --> 16:20.283
For the sedative zolpidem.

16:20.285 --> 16:22.351
Twice the normal dosage.

16:22.353 --> 16:24.486
You would have slept
through a plane crash.

16:24.488 --> 16:26.888
So that's why
they had to wake me up.

16:26.890 --> 16:28.856
I was drugged.

16:28.858 --> 16:31.425
Gave you enough so you'd still
be out of it when you landed.

16:31.427 --> 16:33.427
Make you less likely
to realize the switch.

16:33.429 --> 16:35.162
Hey, guys?

16:35.164 --> 16:36.329
What have you got, eric?

16:36.331 --> 16:37.530
Lax surveillance video

16:37.532 --> 16:39.265
Shows rio leaving
tom bradley terminal.

16:39.267 --> 16:41.033
Callen:
Anyone meet him there?

16:41.035 --> 16:42.567
No, he got on a shuttle van.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.568
What kind of shuttle?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.836
Rental car.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.270
He rented a car?

16:47.272 --> 16:50.539
Yeah, a red mustang convertible

16:50.541 --> 16:52.140
Under the name michael long.

16:52.142 --> 16:53.441
Where is he headed?

16:53.443 --> 16:54.842
All over.

16:54.844 --> 16:57.010
I think he's sightseeing.

17:08.556 --> 17:09.521
(computer chirps)

17:09.523 --> 17:10.989
Where did he go?

17:10.991 --> 17:12.824
Maybe he dumped the car.

17:12.826 --> 17:15.026
Hey, eric, can you remotely
switch off the vehicle?

17:15.028 --> 17:16.994
No. Gps tracking is
the best I could do.

17:16.996 --> 17:19.429
Fail. Epic fail.
Wow.

17:19.431 --> 17:21.597
Whatever happened
to the signal?

17:21.599 --> 17:25.233
Well, kensi, he probably went
into an underground garage.

17:25.235 --> 17:27.501
Do you have an address
for us, mr. Beale?

17:27.503 --> 17:29.102
Best guess is on your phone,
mr. Deeks.

17:29.104 --> 17:30.470
I'll let you know if he moves.

17:30.472 --> 17:32.572
Find him?
Yes, we did.

17:32.574 --> 17:34.106
All right,
I'm coming with you.

17:34.108 --> 17:36.508
No. No, that's not a good idea.
Kensi:
I think

17:36.510 --> 17:38.142
It's a great idea.
It's a great suit,

17:38.144 --> 17:39.009
By the way.

17:39.011 --> 17:40.343
This old thing? Thank you.

17:40.345 --> 17:43.045
I do wish more men
would dress like adults.

17:43.047 --> 17:45.113
(deeks laughs)
you know, in l.A.,

17:45.115 --> 17:47.515
Formal attire tends to be black
t-shirts and flip-flops.

17:47.517 --> 17:50.050
(tony laughs)

17:50.052 --> 17:52.452
Tom ford says, "dressing well
is a form of good manners."

17:52.454 --> 17:53.886
I<i> love</i> tom ford.

17:53.888 --> 17:55.354
He knows how to
a dress woman.

17:55.356 --> 17:58.056
Yeah, but does he know how
to<i> undress</i> a woman?

17:59.592 --> 18:01.525
Shotgun.

18:01.527 --> 18:03.927
You'd look good
in tom ford.

18:03.929 --> 18:05.228
Yeah, I wish.

18:05.230 --> 18:06.862
Say it's for an
undercover op.

18:06.864 --> 18:08.563
Have you met hetty?
Yeah.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.599
Kind of reminds
me of a badger.

18:11.601 --> 18:13.534
You know, you really
did look great

18:13.536 --> 18:15.569
In that cape
and bodice today.

18:15.571 --> 18:17.370
Yeah, that
was all hetty.

18:17.372 --> 18:20.172
Mm, pretty sure
some of that was you.

18:20.174 --> 18:22.641
Too much?
No! No.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.242
Not at all.

18:24.244 --> 18:27.345
I mean, you know,
we of the ren faire

18:27.347 --> 18:30.314
Community strive for a certain
historical accuracy

18:30.316 --> 18:34.184
We it comes to, uh...
Costume fashion.

18:34.186 --> 18:36.986
So, will you be
donning tights?

18:36.988 --> 18:39.321
There will be hose.

18:39.323 --> 18:42.257
Excuse me.
Hosiery.

18:42.259 --> 18:45.326
Girdled trousers will be worn.

18:45.328 --> 18:47.361
Mm.

18:47.363 --> 18:49.563
It doesn't get weird
at these things, does it?

18:49.565 --> 18:52.499
Yeah. Define weird.

18:52.501 --> 18:55.101
I mean, it's not like
a furry convention?

18:55.103 --> 18:58.604
Because those things can fly
off the rails pretty quickly.

18:58.606 --> 19:01.540
Oh, no, no, no. It's more
just like ale drinking,

19:01.542 --> 19:04.476
Bawdy bards, juggling,

19:04.478 --> 19:06.444
Fire magic, jousting,
little arch...

19:06.446 --> 19:09.180
Wait. You've been

19:09.182 --> 19:11.182
To a furry convention?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.450
Yeah, I've been to
califur a few times.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.618
What?

19:15.620 --> 19:18.520
You know I like cosplay.
Yeah.

19:18.522 --> 19:22.190
Sailor moon,
lilith, chun-li.

19:22.192 --> 19:23.691
Didn't know
you had a fursona.

19:23.693 --> 19:26.093
Oh, fursona?

19:26.095 --> 19:27.961
Now, that's some
pretty specific argot

19:27.963 --> 19:30.630
For someone outside the fur
fandom community, sparky.

19:30.632 --> 19:33.165
You don't have a

19:33.167 --> 19:35.567
Fur suit in your closet
I don't know about, do you?

19:35.569 --> 19:39.671
Would that be weird
or cool if I did?

19:39.673 --> 19:42.006
Depends on what it was.

19:42.008 --> 19:45.009
Platypus?

19:45.011 --> 19:46.143
Weird.

19:46.145 --> 19:47.277
Narwhal.

19:47.279 --> 19:48.578
Cool.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.012
Aardvark?

19:50.014 --> 19:51.279
Weird.

19:51.281 --> 19:53.514
Komodo dragon.

19:53.516 --> 19:55.115
Very cool.

19:55.117 --> 19:57.617
Musk ox?

19:58.586 --> 20:00.652
No.

20:00.654 --> 20:03.988
All right.
So what is your fursona?

20:03.990 --> 20:06.490
Fennec fox.

20:06.492 --> 20:10.560
Nice! Or should I say... Foxy?

20:10.562 --> 20:11.561
(laughs)

20:11.563 --> 20:12.628
(clears his throat)

20:12.630 --> 20:14.129
Granger...

20:14.131 --> 20:16.131
Director... Assistant...

20:16.133 --> 20:17.699
He's been talking
backwards all morning.

20:17.701 --> 20:19.434
I'm pretty sure it's
a software issue.

20:19.436 --> 20:21.969
Where are we?

20:21.971 --> 20:24.371
Uh, we're just still
trying to locate rio.

20:24.373 --> 20:26.606
We think we know the area
where his car may be.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.608
Kensi and deeks
are headed there now.
With dinozzo.

20:28.610 --> 20:32.345
Yeah. Anything else?

20:32.347 --> 20:34.413
That's all for now.

20:44.491 --> 20:49.393
Did he just say,
"that's all<i> fur</i> now?"

20:49.395 --> 20:51.395
No.

20:51.397 --> 20:54.564
Did he?

20:54.566 --> 20:57.567
We can't keep her here
much longer.

20:57.569 --> 21:00.436
We cut her loose.

21:00.438 --> 21:02.304
Maybe she leads us
to rio.

21:02.306 --> 21:04.439
You really think
she's that stupid?

21:04.441 --> 21:07.175
Well, she was stupid enough to
get involved in the first place,

21:07.177 --> 21:09.577
Stupid enough to think
she could outsmart us.

21:09.579 --> 21:11.245
That's like
stupid-squared.

21:11.247 --> 21:13.580
Even if she
is, rio isn't.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.582
He's played this thing
pretty well so far.

21:15.584 --> 21:17.650
There's no way he would
let her know where he is.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.518
I don't know.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.554
He's riding around l.A.
In a convertible like a tourist.

21:22.556 --> 21:24.088
Is he?

21:24.090 --> 21:25.722
Or is he meeting
contacts at places

21:25.724 --> 21:28.524
Where it's just very easy
to blend in?

21:28.526 --> 21:30.359
Might've planned
this whole thing out.

21:30.361 --> 21:33.695
I doubt he planned on
getting arrested in singapore.

21:33.697 --> 21:35.296
Nobody does.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.532
Yeah? And whose fault
was that?

21:38.534 --> 21:40.634
(laughs)
I still have
a scar

21:40.636 --> 21:42.569
From that guy,
thank you very much.

21:42.571 --> 21:44.270
That wasn't a guy.

21:44.272 --> 21:46.239
Look, don't start with me.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.207
You think a girl
could knock me down like that?
You were off-balance.

21:48.209 --> 21:50.542
She got a lucky punch.
The guy had a adam's apple

21:50.544 --> 21:52.544
The size
of a pomegranate.
Mm-hmm.

21:52.546 --> 21:54.479
Just like those twins
in ratchaburi.
No, no, no.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.147
Now, one of those
actually was a woman.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.481
In your dreams.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.250
You-you know who would love
that story?

22:00.252 --> 22:01.618
Who's that?
Deeks would love

22:01.620 --> 22:03.186
That story.
You think?

22:03.188 --> 22:05.087
Absolutely.
Hmm.

22:05.089 --> 22:08.557
You know what story
deeks would<i> really</i> love?

22:08.559 --> 22:10.358
Don't say it.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.059
Tumakuru.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.460
What did I just say to you?

22:13.462 --> 22:15.095
Tuma-freaking-kuru,

22:15.096 --> 22:16.729
Where you fought an
entire bar full of midgets.

22:16.731 --> 22:20.265
I got us a ride out
of there, didn't I?

22:20.267 --> 22:22.066
And those weren't
little people--

22:22.068 --> 22:23.534
They were just short.
Every
one

22:23.536 --> 22:25.068
Of them was shorter than hetty.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.402
If I had a video...

22:26.404 --> 22:29.505
You had a guy hanging
off your ear by his teeth.

22:29.507 --> 22:33.608
Why do you h...
He was chewing on a
piece of beef jerky.

22:37.146 --> 22:38.612
Kensi:
Eric, do we have any movement?

22:38.614 --> 22:40.146
No.

22:40.148 --> 22:42.681
Car hasn't reappeared,
from what I can tell.

22:45.852 --> 22:49.453
Well, all right.
There's a red mustang.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.455
Rio's nowhere
in sight.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.690
Must be up
on the street.

22:53.692 --> 22:55.725
All right, let's do this.
You go topside, see

22:55.727 --> 22:57.593
If you can spot him. Dinozzo
and I will stay back here

22:57.595 --> 22:59.728
In case he comes back.
Yeah, that seems
like a terrible plan,

22:59.730 --> 23:01.529
Because I'm not the person
that lost him.

23:01.531 --> 23:02.763
Technically,

23:02.765 --> 23:04.598
I didn't lose him either.
Okay,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.701
He's not my prisoner--
he's yours.
Okay,

23:07.703 --> 23:09.469
Don't get your wig in a mess.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.770
I'll go find him.

23:10.772 --> 23:12.438
I'll come
with you.
No, I'll go. I'll go.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.672
Whoa, whoa.
Come here.

23:13.674 --> 23:15.507
What is wrong
with you?
What's wrong

23:15.509 --> 23:18.142
With me? What's wrong with you?
Why are you being weird?

23:18.144 --> 23:20.377
I'm not being weird. You're
being weird. I'm the one
that's acting normal.

23:20.379 --> 23:21.711
Oh? And what does
that look like?
It looks like...

23:21.713 --> 23:24.680
Guys, time's kind of
an issue for me here,

23:24.682 --> 23:27.682
So can we get
a move on? Thanks.

23:28.818 --> 23:31.351
(grunts)

23:31.353 --> 23:33.353
(indistinct chatter)

23:33.355 --> 23:34.454
Hi.
Hi.

23:35.423 --> 23:38.390
Wow.

23:41.561 --> 23:44.628
Gonna get a murse to
match your pantsuit?

23:44.630 --> 23:47.564
(chuckles)
so you're not
a federal agent, huh?

23:47.566 --> 23:50.567
No. Lapd liaison.

23:50.569 --> 23:52.669
What does that mean?
I'm pretty sure

23:52.671 --> 23:54.570
It's french for "secret weapon."

23:54.572 --> 23:56.438
No, that would be
<i> "l'arme secrète."</i>

23:56.440 --> 23:58.907
Oh, wow. French canadian. You
obviously have an ear for it.

23:58.909 --> 24:00.642
So, I'm guessing
with that shaggy do,

24:00.644 --> 24:03.745
You weren't very popular
on the police force.
Au contraire,

24:03.747 --> 24:06.514
<i> Mon ami,</i> I was the king
of the constabulary ball.

24:06.516 --> 24:08.582
(chuckles)
so what was it?

24:08.584 --> 24:11.518
Internal affairs investigation
land you here?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.920
Drugs? I'm guessing
you were a coke monkey.

24:13.922 --> 24:17.456
Not a coke<i> monkey,</i> per se.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.690
Deeks,

24:18.692 --> 24:20.758
I only say this to you
because I care.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.428
It's dangerous for you to cook
the meth in your trailer.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.430
The gases.

24:26.432 --> 24:30.434
You know that you can, uh,
o.D. On teeth whiteners?

24:30.436 --> 24:31.601
(laughs)

24:31.603 --> 24:32.935
Hetty recruited me.

24:32.937 --> 24:34.770
From a folk band?
Kensi:
Girls, you are

24:34.772 --> 24:36.938
Both pretty. Although one of you

24:36.940 --> 24:39.473
Clearly has
better fashion sense.
Not to mention

24:39.475 --> 24:41.475
Grooming.
Mmm. Listen.

24:41.477 --> 24:44.845
(clears throat)
it's actually called,
uh, surf chic.

24:44.847 --> 24:47.514
Tony: I believed
it's pronounced "surf chick."

24:47.516 --> 24:50.183
Ladies, heads up and shut up.

24:50.185 --> 24:54.420
Rio just came back from what
looks like a shopping spree.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.292
Federal agent.

25:01.294 --> 25:03.594
Stop.
Rio,

25:03.596 --> 25:05.729
Put the bags down.
Put your hands behind your head.

25:05.731 --> 25:08.765
My name is sarawut.
Sarawut saosong.

25:08.767 --> 25:11.300
I think you have me confused
for somebody else.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.467
You wish.

25:13.436 --> 25:15.669
Don't even think
about it.

25:15.671 --> 25:17.771
Get down on
your knees.

25:17.773 --> 25:19.272
(groaning)

25:19.274 --> 25:21.841
Ooh. Bang, bang, sexy time.

25:21.843 --> 25:24.210
(groans)
shut up and cross your feet.

25:24.212 --> 25:25.778
(moaning)

25:25.780 --> 25:26.612
You okay?

25:26.614 --> 25:27.679
My chest.
(moans)

25:27.681 --> 25:28.680
I'm having a heart attack.

25:28.682 --> 25:30.481
Call 911.

25:32.518 --> 25:34.917
(gunshots)

25:37.755 --> 25:39.287
Deeks!

25:39.289 --> 25:41.255
(gunshots)

25:41.257 --> 25:42.589
Deeks:
Freeze!
Stop the car!

25:42.591 --> 25:45.391
(tires screeching)

25:50.364 --> 25:52.364
Where's rio?
I'm guessing
he had the good sense

25:52.366 --> 25:54.699
To run away
when the bullets started.

25:54.701 --> 25:56.801
Who were those guys?

25:56.803 --> 25:58.869
I just got here.

25:58.871 --> 26:01.271
This is your town.

26:12.249 --> 26:13.915
Is it an iguana?

26:13.917 --> 26:15.349
It's an armadillo.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.420
Can you get your finger
out of my origami?

26:21.356 --> 26:23.689
This is your desk.

26:23.691 --> 26:24.990
Sorry.

26:30.396 --> 26:32.696
That rio's
stuff?

26:32.698 --> 26:34.698
Yes, indeed.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.267
Wow, maybe he really was here
on vacation.

26:37.269 --> 26:38.434
Kensi:
Hmm.
Did you find him?

26:38.436 --> 26:39.268
Not yet.

26:39.270 --> 26:40.802
But we did
identify

26:40.804 --> 26:41.969
The shooter
that you apprehended.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.570
His name is philipe del la haye

26:43.572 --> 26:44.737
Of jersey.

26:44.739 --> 26:46.872
Mob connections?

26:46.874 --> 26:48.740
Not new jersey. Jersey jersey,

26:48.742 --> 26:50.341
Off the coast of normandy.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.309
Oh. Old jersey.
Officially
called

26:52.311 --> 26:55.345
The bailiwick of jersey.
Deeks:
Bailiwick?

26:55.347 --> 26:56.479
You sure it's not
a donnybrook?

26:56.481 --> 26:57.680
Might be more of a mollycoddle.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.014
Don't encourage him.

26:59.016 --> 27:00.782
Eric:
Jersey's part
of the channel islands between

27:00.784 --> 27:03.351
England and France, but it's
a self-governing democracy

27:03.353 --> 27:04.785
With its own financial
and legal systems.

27:04.787 --> 27:07.387
That's interesting. 'cause
I never found the jersey boys

27:07.389 --> 27:08.955
That dangerous when
they were singing and dancing.

27:08.957 --> 27:11.390
Maybe they're working
for pippin now.
Ooh.

27:11.392 --> 27:12.691
I thought
you were better than that.
What does this guy want

27:12.693 --> 27:13.725
With rio?

27:13.727 --> 27:14.726
We're not sure.

27:14.728 --> 27:16.461
He works
for a local trust company.

27:16.463 --> 27:18.496
But here's
the interesting part.

27:18.498 --> 27:20.998
So, every year, the bureau
of international narcotics

27:21.000 --> 27:22.733
And law enforcement
affairs rates

27:22.735 --> 27:25.001
The money laundering operations
around the world.

27:25.003 --> 27:26.669
Jersey just so happens
to be one

27:26.671 --> 27:28.337
Of the places
of primary concern.

27:28.339 --> 27:31.506
And it's one of the leading
offshore banking centers.

27:31.508 --> 27:33.474
Rio is the mack daddy
of money laundering.

27:33.476 --> 27:34.541
"mack daddy."

27:34.543 --> 27:35.842
Really?

27:35.844 --> 27:37.710
That means every
criminal he's ever worked with

27:37.712 --> 27:40.045
Will be willing to kill him
to prevent their assets
from being seized.

27:40.047 --> 27:42.313
We got to find this guy.
If the bailiwick of jersey knows

27:42.315 --> 27:44.381
He's here,
odds are others do as well.

27:45.917 --> 27:48.918
Hey, guys?

27:48.920 --> 27:50.519
Check
this out.

27:50.521 --> 27:53.054
Hydrocodone.

27:53.056 --> 27:55.489
Ondansetron.
That's used

27:55.491 --> 27:57.424
For nausea and vomiting.
Arnica,

27:57.426 --> 27:59.592
Bromelain, moisturizer.

27:59.594 --> 28:01.327
Arnica's used
for bruises.

28:01.329 --> 28:03.462
Bromelain's an
anti-inflammatory.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.564
It's a post-op kit
for cosmetic surgery.

28:05.566 --> 28:07.732
Of course!

28:07.734 --> 28:09.734
Michael long.

28:09.736 --> 28:12.737
That's right.
Detective lieutenant
michael arthur long.

28:12.739 --> 28:14.505
He was shot in the face.

28:14.507 --> 28:16.473
He was rescued
by billionaire wilton knight

28:16.475 --> 28:19.809
And was the primary field agent
for the foundation

28:19.811 --> 28:21.377
Of law and government.

28:21.379 --> 28:22.344
Flag.

28:22.346 --> 28:23.011
Flag.

28:23.013 --> 28:24.679
Sam:
What?

28:24.681 --> 28:26.981
What are you two talking about?
Nell:
<i> Knight rider,</i>

28:26.983 --> 28:28.515
Starring
david hasselhoff.

28:28.517 --> 28:29.782
The hoff.
Don't you dare hassle him.

28:29.784 --> 28:30.783
Nell:
'80s tv show

28:30.785 --> 28:32.384
With a talking car.

28:32.386 --> 28:34.519
A.K.A. Kitt.

28:34.521 --> 28:36.020
And the knight industries
two thousand

28:36.022 --> 28:38.122
Was a little more
than a talking car.

28:38.124 --> 28:39.656
Oh, yeah.
Do you
ever get

28:39.658 --> 28:41.090
The feeling
we're working alone here?

28:41.092 --> 28:42.875
Every single day.

28:42.876 --> 28:44.659
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Do not loop nell and me

28:44.662 --> 28:46.461
In this... Geek squad.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.695
Thank you.
Tony:
After he was shot,

28:47.697 --> 28:48.962
Michael arthur
was in need

28:48.964 --> 28:50.496
Of cosmetic surgery.

28:50.498 --> 28:52.498
New face, new identity.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.633
And I think
that's what rio is doing.
Well,

28:54.635 --> 28:57.035
There's no better place to get
a new face than hollywood.

28:57.037 --> 29:00.038
No identification on this
kit, but if it was in
the shopping bags,

29:00.040 --> 29:01.706
Obviously he got it
at the same time.

29:01.708 --> 29:04.408
Chances are his surgeon is
located in the same area.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.376
That narrows it down
to about 1,000.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.510
Okay, we'll start
with the places

29:07.512 --> 29:08.711
That are closest
to the parking garage,

29:08.713 --> 29:10.546
Then extend
from there.

29:10.548 --> 29:13.081
He'll probably need a place to
recover for a couple of weeks,

29:13.083 --> 29:15.917
So places close enough
for post-op visits.

29:15.919 --> 29:17.551
Right.
We'll start sorting through

29:17.553 --> 29:19.686
The hotels, try to find
someone checking in today

29:19.688 --> 29:21.421
For approximately two weeks.

29:21.423 --> 29:22.522
Kensi (chuckling):
Oh.

29:22.524 --> 29:23.890
You got
to be kidding me.

29:25.059 --> 29:26.892
Tony:
Bam!

29:26.894 --> 29:28.927
Did I call that or what?

29:36.002 --> 29:38.402
Hey. Any luck?

29:38.404 --> 29:40.504
No. You?

29:40.506 --> 29:41.705
We saw alec baldwin.
Oh.

29:41.707 --> 29:43.707
No, no. That was
just a mirror.

29:43.709 --> 29:45.675
Who's next?

29:45.677 --> 29:48.511
Why don't I take
bedford. And, uh,

29:48.513 --> 29:50.846
You take roxbury. Maybe...

29:50.848 --> 29:53.849
Get a quote on doing something
with deeks' face.

29:53.851 --> 29:55.550
Yeah?
That was
aggressive.

29:59.722 --> 30:02.723
Okay. Shall we?

30:02.725 --> 30:05.459
It's never gonna work, you know.
Why not?

30:05.461 --> 30:07.928
Trust me,
I've been there.
Oh, you mean plastic surgery?

30:07.930 --> 30:10.063
God, I knew it.
'cause of that ken doll chin.

30:10.065 --> 30:12.198
You and blye.
What, our partnership?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.200
The other ship.
What other ship?

30:14.202 --> 30:16.735
You know what ship.
I don't know what ship
you're talking about.

30:16.737 --> 30:19.137
Your relationship.
Oh, you're shipping us?
'cause you need to stop

30:19.139 --> 30:20.972
Right now before you
embarrass yourself.
(sighs)

30:20.974 --> 30:23.441
Okay. How can you possibly do
undercover work

30:23.443 --> 30:24.775
And be this bad a liar?

30:24.777 --> 30:27.444
You couldn't infiltrate
community dinner theater.

30:27.446 --> 30:28.945
You do a lot of undercover work,
do you?

30:28.947 --> 30:31.047
A ton. I do a ton.

30:31.049 --> 30:35.051
As a sears model,
circa 1970?

30:35.053 --> 30:37.119
Who hurt you?

30:38.188 --> 30:39.987
(door opens)

30:42.491 --> 30:44.457
How can I help you gentlemen?

30:44.459 --> 30:46.725
Is this a patient of yours?

30:49.229 --> 30:51.596
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to tell you the same thing

30:51.598 --> 30:53.931
My colleagues downstairs
just did.

30:53.933 --> 30:55.999
Unfortunately,
saying anything at all

30:56.001 --> 30:57.834
Would not only be
a breach

30:57.836 --> 31:00.169
Of my patients' confidentiality
but also

31:00.171 --> 31:02.338
Is a serious hipaa violation.

31:02.339 --> 31:04.506
Callen:
No, we understand, but this is
an extraordinary situation.

31:04.508 --> 31:08.510
The man in that photo is
a criminal with terrorist ties.

31:08.512 --> 31:11.112
Now that you know
that, if he is

31:11.114 --> 31:13.647
A patient of yours,
and you go ahead

31:13.649 --> 31:15.482
And have surgery
and alter his appearance,

31:15.484 --> 31:18.485
Then you
will be guilty

31:18.487 --> 31:21.254
Of aiding and abetting
a fugitive.

31:22.557 --> 31:24.023
Not good for business.

31:24.025 --> 31:26.258
A jailhouse surgeon
has a, uh...

31:26.260 --> 31:29.027
Very different
clientele.

31:31.765 --> 31:34.198
Would you excuse me
for just one moment?

31:34.200 --> 31:35.499
Mm-hmm.

31:37.269 --> 31:38.268
(door opens)

31:38.270 --> 31:39.669
What do you think?

31:39.671 --> 31:41.203
I think he's our guy,

31:41.205 --> 31:44.206
And right now he's back there
calling his lawyer for advice.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.141
I think you're right.

31:46.143 --> 31:49.277
Would you ever... Consider
getting a little work done,

31:49.279 --> 31:51.045
You know, when
the time comes?

31:51.047 --> 31:52.579
Nah. No need.

31:52.581 --> 31:54.080
Black don't crack.

31:54.082 --> 31:55.981
Oh. Why is that?

31:55.983 --> 31:58.283
Superior genetics, baby.

31:58.285 --> 32:00.852
(laughs)
I mean, that and
a clean lifestyle.

32:00.854 --> 32:02.253
Yeah.
I treat my body

32:02.255 --> 32:03.887
Like a precision race car.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.722
Keep it shiny and new forever.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.557
You treat yours
like a garbage truck.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.560
Well, what if your, uh,
what if your race car body,

32:10.562 --> 32:12.628
What if it lives forever
but your brain dies?

32:12.630 --> 32:14.630
I mean... What do you do then?
Mm.

32:14.632 --> 32:16.665
Who's gonna...
Take care of the hulk?

32:16.667 --> 32:19.034
Well, it damn sure
won't be you,

32:19.036 --> 32:21.536
'cause you'll be long dead
living like you do.
Uh-huh.

32:23.039 --> 32:25.706
He told me his name
was mr. Reyes from manila.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.774
He's staying at the sofitel.

32:29.577 --> 32:31.710
Is... That...

32:31.712 --> 32:35.680
Oh. We're just using that
as a guideline.

32:40.286 --> 32:43.587
Well, if he's in there
he's not answering his phone.

32:43.589 --> 32:45.089
Sam and I are gonna
check his room.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.590
All right, dinozzo and I
will work the rest of the hotel.

32:46.592 --> 32:48.625
Sam:
Guess that leaves you

32:48.627 --> 32:51.160
To keep an eye out in case
he does more shopping.

32:51.162 --> 32:52.561
Deeks.
Yeah?

32:52.563 --> 32:54.663
No, definitely,
I should stay out here

32:54.665 --> 32:57.165
With the harmful uv rays--
you guys go inside.

32:57.167 --> 32:59.967
Enjoy that
air-conditioning.

33:00.936 --> 33:03.002
Tony:
<i> You ever consider</i>

33:03.004 --> 33:05.738
Working in washington?
Oh, no. Too cold.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.773
You ever consider
working in l.A.?
I hadn't.

33:07.775 --> 33:10.242
(phone ringing)
maybe it's time for
a change of scenery.

33:10.244 --> 33:12.277
Yeah, those are rentals.
(chuckles)

33:12.279 --> 33:13.945
(ringing continues)
are you gonna get that?

33:13.947 --> 33:15.146
Uh... It can wait.

33:15.148 --> 33:16.814
What if it's important?

33:16.816 --> 33:18.215
It's probably not.

33:18.217 --> 33:19.649
So look.

33:19.651 --> 33:22.318
(ringing continues)
I can't.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.687
What if it's your boss?

33:24.689 --> 33:26.689
Well, then he would be
in a state

33:26.691 --> 33:28.023
Of quantum superposition
like schrodinger's cat,

33:28.025 --> 33:29.290
And as long as I don't...

33:29.292 --> 33:30.658
Ooh. Please don't.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.959
Gibbs?

33:31.961 --> 33:33.260
Yeah.

33:34.696 --> 33:35.828
Due to technical difficulties,

33:35.830 --> 33:37.696
The customer you
are trying to reach

33:37.698 --> 33:39.097
Cannot receive messages
at this time.

33:39.099 --> 33:40.698
Please try again later.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.166
(imitates electronic voice):
A-19.

33:42.168 --> 33:44.701
You're so very welcome.

33:45.670 --> 33:48.003
You just killed me and my cat.

33:48.005 --> 33:50.071
¶ ¶

33:53.943 --> 33:56.076
Housekeeping!

34:01.349 --> 34:02.915
(beep)

34:13.126 --> 34:16.193
(high-pitched gasping)

34:16.195 --> 34:18.094
It's over, rio.

34:18.096 --> 34:20.129
My name is jesse reyes!
Yeah?

34:20.131 --> 34:21.630
And I'm molly ringwald!

34:21.632 --> 34:24.265
(rattling door)
open the door, rio.

34:24.267 --> 34:26.834
That's not my name!
Well, it's one of 'em.

34:26.836 --> 34:28.402
I'll give you each

34:28.404 --> 34:30.137
Fifty thousand dollars!

34:30.139 --> 34:31.771
We're federal agents!

34:31.773 --> 34:35.040
Okay, how about, uh,
a hundred thousand dollars each?

34:35.042 --> 34:36.241
Open the door!

34:36.243 --> 34:37.942
I have a gun.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.112
No, you don't.
(gasps)

34:42.114 --> 34:44.647
We have to break down this
door, we might hurt you.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.148
If I have to break
down the door,

34:46.150 --> 34:48.150
I'm<i> gonna</i> hurt you.
Come out of there!

34:48.152 --> 34:50.118
(grunting)

34:50.120 --> 34:53.721
(grunting,
yelling)

34:53.723 --> 34:56.023
I'm having a heart attack!

34:56.025 --> 34:58.125
(grunts)

34:58.127 --> 35:00.727
Huh. That's
your second one today.

35:01.696 --> 35:03.095
(exhales)

35:04.998 --> 35:06.797
(camera shutter clicking)

35:20.011 --> 35:21.377
Godzilla!

35:21.379 --> 35:23.779
Move.
I need to get dressed.

35:23.781 --> 35:25.380
It's too late.
Move. Move.
(groans)

35:25.382 --> 35:28.116
Get out there.

35:28.118 --> 35:30.118
I'm seeking refugee status.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.954
If you send me back
to north korea,
I will be executed.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.855
Oh, you're north korean now?
All right, all right!

35:34.857 --> 35:37.190
Enough games! All right,
the real truth is this--

35:37.192 --> 35:39.392
My name is jeff carol
and I'm in the cia.

35:39.394 --> 35:41.227
If you guys
don't leave right now,

35:41.229 --> 35:42.394
You're gonna blow my cover.

35:42.396 --> 35:44.428
I suggest you get out of here
right now.

35:46.899 --> 35:48.348
(gasps)

35:48.349 --> 35:49.798
All right! I'm small,
bro! You're big!

36:00.812 --> 36:03.045
Deeks:
Guys, you may have
some unwanted guests.

36:03.047 --> 36:05.447
Man:
Take that for you?

36:05.449 --> 36:09.184
Deeks:
And one of them look like
the shooter from the garage.

36:10.353 --> 36:11.952
(over radio):
Kenz, check out the three guys

36:11.954 --> 36:13.853
That are just entering
the hotel now.

36:14.822 --> 36:16.288
I got 'em.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.890
They look like your friends
from jersey?

36:24.330 --> 36:25.929
This isn't good.

36:25.931 --> 36:27.297
What's not good?
Kensi: We got 'em

36:27.299 --> 36:29.098
But there aren't three,
there are five.

36:30.835 --> 36:32.201
Sam and callen,
get out of there now.

36:32.203 --> 36:33.869
Guys, we got
too many civilians out here.

36:33.871 --> 36:35.103
You need to get them out
quietly.

36:38.475 --> 36:40.141
It's clear.

36:42.445 --> 36:43.944
Let's take
the stairs.

36:43.946 --> 36:45.779
(panting):
I need a gun.

36:45.781 --> 36:46.846
You need to shut up.

36:46.848 --> 36:48.848
Do you work out a lot?

36:48.850 --> 36:50.516
I'm thinking
about joining a gym.

36:50.517 --> 36:52.183
My mom says I'm shaped
like a scallop.
You'll have plenty

36:52.186 --> 36:53.785
Of time to work out in prison.

36:53.787 --> 36:54.819
Prison? What do you mean?
I'm a secret weapon

36:54.821 --> 36:55.953
In your war on terror.

36:55.955 --> 36:57.854
Seriously,
you need to stop talking.

36:57.856 --> 37:00.956
I really like you guys--
we should hang out after this.

37:02.793 --> 37:03.925
Oh, my god!

37:03.927 --> 37:04.825
Sam:
Gun!

37:04.827 --> 37:06.826
(gunfire)

37:10.031 --> 37:11.296
Callen:
Rio's on the run.

37:11.298 --> 37:12.397
He's like a little jackrabbit.

37:16.302 --> 37:19.369
(panting, whimpering)

37:23.041 --> 37:24.340
(high-pitched):
Move!

37:24.342 --> 37:27.909
(panting, whimpering)

37:28.878 --> 37:30.010
(grunts)

37:31.880 --> 37:34.247
(rio whimpering)
huh. Nice bathrobe, rio.

37:35.149 --> 37:35.847
Stop.

37:35.849 --> 37:37.782
Hey! Stop!

37:38.317 --> 37:39.382
Stop! Federal...

37:39.384 --> 37:41.050
Oh!

37:41.052 --> 37:43.218
Kensi:
Guys, we lost rio.

37:46.856 --> 37:48.572
Hey, go. I got this.
You sure?

37:48.573 --> 37:50.289
I'm not as fast
as you think I am.
Then start running...

37:50.292 --> 37:51.524
Now!

38:00.968 --> 38:03.368
Kensi: Deeks, another shooter
making a break for it.
Damn it.

38:03.370 --> 38:05.837
(panting, whimpering)

38:05.839 --> 38:09.040
(gasping):
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah...

38:09.809 --> 38:11.208
Oh!

38:12.411 --> 38:14.844
(frantic groaning)

38:14.846 --> 38:16.812
(bullets ricocheting)

38:16.814 --> 38:19.014
Aah! Help!

38:19.016 --> 38:21.282
I'm being attacked
by a homeless man!

38:21.284 --> 38:22.816
I got him!
Callen:
Don't let him escape.

38:22.818 --> 38:25.318
Sam:
And don't let him get killed.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.186
Deeks:
How about one out of two?

38:27.188 --> 38:29.121
Does everyone in america
own a gun or something?

38:29.123 --> 38:30.288
Stay down!

38:31.491 --> 38:33.023
(whimpers)

38:37.862 --> 38:39.428
You know what?
I had enough of this.

38:39.430 --> 38:40.595
Cover me.

38:53.275 --> 38:55.074
(gasping)

38:56.410 --> 38:58.576
I can use some help here.

38:58.578 --> 38:59.843
(grunts)

38:59.845 --> 39:01.110
Miss me?

39:01.112 --> 39:02.311
Yeah. Can you
do me a favor,

39:02.313 --> 39:03.578
Stand up, tell me
how many guys there are?

39:03.580 --> 39:05.179
I don't have to--
there are at least two.

39:05.181 --> 39:06.413
Two?

39:07.249 --> 39:08.615
Please don't let them kill me.

39:08.617 --> 39:09.882
Shut up!

39:09.884 --> 39:12.384
What is that
thing you do?
What?

39:12.386 --> 39:14.119
With your hair-- it's, like,
a nervous tick or something.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.853
What are you talking about?
I can't see-- I got
hair in my eyes.

39:15.856 --> 39:17.089
Get a haircut!
He's right.

39:17.090 --> 39:18.323
You should go to supercuts.
You need to get some layers.

39:18.325 --> 39:19.924
Shut up!
Shut up!
Okay.

39:19.926 --> 39:21.091
One, two, three!

39:24.396 --> 39:26.062
(gunfire continues)
(grunts)

39:26.064 --> 39:29.298
Sam:
Federal agents! Drop it, now!

39:29.300 --> 39:31.300
Callen: Go.
Drop the weapon!

39:31.302 --> 39:33.602
On your knees.
Get down on the
ground, facedown!

39:33.604 --> 39:35.270
Facedown!

39:35.272 --> 39:37.238
I think I just peed.

39:38.908 --> 39:41.375
Well, that was fun.

39:41.377 --> 39:43.577
Just another day in l.A., baby.

39:43.579 --> 39:45.012
If you're gonna get shot it,

39:45.013 --> 39:46.446
You might as well do it
in the sunshine.

39:46.448 --> 39:47.880
You guys are like having
my own a-team.

39:47.882 --> 39:50.549
Hannibal, murdock, face...

39:50.551 --> 39:52.284
Say it and I'll
shoot you in the face.

39:52.286 --> 39:53.418
(deep voice):
I pity the fool!

39:53.420 --> 39:54.585
(giggles)

39:54.587 --> 39:56.186
Kensi:
Hey.

39:57.389 --> 40:00.990
Ah, bang, bang, sexy time.
(laughs)

40:00.992 --> 40:02.291
Put a sock in it.

40:02.293 --> 40:03.425
You guys okay?

40:03.426 --> 40:04.558
We're solid.
Rio: Could I say something?

40:04.561 --> 40:06.010
No!
Shut up!

40:06.011 --> 40:07.460
I'm gonna say it anyway,
because I live in america.

40:07.463 --> 40:09.196
I'll give you guys
a half a million apiece

40:09.198 --> 40:11.081
If you guys would
still let me go, okay?

40:11.082 --> 40:12.965
I'm just throwing it out there.
It's over, knight rider.

40:12.968 --> 40:15.301
Rio (grunting): I'm having
a heart attack! Call 911!

40:18.606 --> 40:22.107
Well, I'm not gonna lie--
we came, we saw, we captured.

40:22.109 --> 40:24.342
Granger:
And you practically destroyed
the hotel.

40:24.344 --> 40:25.609
No civilian casualties.

40:25.611 --> 40:27.377
You're lucky.

40:27.379 --> 40:29.112
So where's rio?

40:29.114 --> 40:30.346
Prisoner transport van.

40:30.348 --> 40:31.980
We're going to escort them
back to the gate.

40:31.982 --> 40:34.182
Ah, that's nice,
but not really necessary.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.017
We're going to escort you
back to the gate.

40:36.019 --> 40:39.453
They're going to escort us
back to the gate.

40:39.455 --> 40:40.387
Good.

40:40.389 --> 40:42.455
Thank you for your help.

40:42.457 --> 40:43.622
Our pleasure.

40:43.624 --> 40:44.956
Wouldn't go<i> that</i> far.

40:44.958 --> 40:47.058
Give me a hug.

40:48.461 --> 40:51.295
Come back to us anytime
you get tired of washington.

40:51.297 --> 40:53.463
I just might do that.

40:53.465 --> 40:54.430
Deeks.

40:55.366 --> 40:56.998
Oh, nice.
Well played.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.433
Hetty (clears throat):
Mr. Dinozzo,

40:59.435 --> 41:00.667
Before you go,

41:00.669 --> 41:03.202
You had a call
from gibbs.

41:03.204 --> 41:04.403
Oh.

41:04.405 --> 41:06.071
Hetty:
Apparently, he's been

41:06.073 --> 41:08.006
Having difficulty reaching you.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.574
(chuckles): Yeah. Well,
we... 'cause we, uh,

41:09.576 --> 41:11.075
There was a gun battle,

41:11.077 --> 41:12.709
And, um...

41:12.711 --> 41:14.377
What did he say?

41:14.379 --> 41:16.312
He said I should give you
a message.

41:16.314 --> 41:17.413
Ah.

41:17.415 --> 41:18.580
Okay.
Come.

41:23.386 --> 41:24.418
Kensi: Oh!
Deeks: Ow.

41:25.187 --> 41:26.152
Ooh.

41:28.422 --> 41:30.455
That's from gibbs.

41:30.457 --> 41:34.125
Hetty:
<i> Now get out of my town.</i>

41:34.127 --> 41:35.192
