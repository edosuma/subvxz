Thank you. How you doing today, Jack?

02:04.356 --> 02:06.559
What time is it?

02:06.591 --> 02:08.994
It'll soon be 2:00. Yeah.

02:10.729 --> 02:11.830
How about the day?

02:11.862 --> 02:13.198
Excuse me?

02:13.230 --> 02:14.332
What day is it?

02:14.366 --> 02:15.701
It's the fourth!

02:15.734 --> 02:17.603
Friday?

02:17.635 --> 02:19.270
No, it's Tuesday.

02:19.303 --> 02:20.137
All right.

02:20.171 --> 02:23.341

04:10.748 --> 04:12.418
How long have I been asleep?

04:12.450 --> 04:14.952
I don't know how I would know that?

04:14.986 --> 04:17.822
Makes sense.

04:17.856 --> 04:20.091
So, how've you been?

04:21.726 --> 04:22.928
Yeah.

04:34.772 --> 04:35.239
That look good to you?

04:35.272 --> 04:36.674
Yeah.

04:36.707 --> 04:41.012
Hey, I heard through the grapevine
that, um, you used to work for Miller?

04:41.046 --> 04:42.880
Okay.

04:42.914 --> 04:44.315
Well, is that true?

04:44.349 --> 04:45.918
No.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:48.352 --> 04:50.755
Well, um, I just wanted to tell you...

04:50.789 --> 04:55.159
that my internship is gonna
be over in two weeks and...

04:55.193 --> 04:56.462
I'll find another intern.

04:56.495 --> 04:58.864
Where are you gonna find another intern?

04:58.897 --> 05:02.835
Money... people like money.

05:02.868 --> 05:05.137
Alrighty then, worked on me.

05:06.404 --> 05:10.743
Oh yeah, I actually won't
be able to do Thursday.

05:10.775 --> 05:15.113
So, maybe we can connect
tomorrow? You know, same time?

05:15.147 --> 05:18.117
- Okay.
- Thanks.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.887
You know, discreet's the way to go.

05:21.919 --> 05:23.855
The whole reason why I can't do Friday...

05:23.888 --> 05:27.859
is my sister has this big orientation
thing and you know, I gotta be...

05:32.863 --> 05:34.065
Tomorrow!

06:08.500 --> 06:11.170
Uh... uh...

06:40.265 --> 06:42.868
Hey.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.936
Hi.

06:43.969 --> 06:45.204
How was your meeting with Jeremy?

06:45.236 --> 06:46.571
Fine.

06:46.604 --> 06:48.807
Wow... great.

06:52.142 --> 06:54.512
Oh, okay... okay.

07:04.589 --> 07:06.124
So...

07:06.157 --> 07:07.526
you and Jeremy meet often?

07:07.558 --> 07:08.392
Sometimes.

07:08.426 --> 07:10.996
Oh, yeah, well, we're looking for him...

07:11.029 --> 07:12.497
so maybe you should join us for a ride.

07:12.529 --> 07:13.565
I'm okay.

07:13.597 --> 07:17.035
Oh, yeah, you know what?
That's not really an option.

07:22.907 --> 07:24.275
- Don't.
- What?

07:27.279 --> 07:29.081

Hey, Jack.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.728
Oh, my god, what happened to your hand?

08:50.761 --> 08:52.330
And your eyes?

08:52.364 --> 08:54.366
Um...

08:54.399 --> 08:55.267
pepper spray.

08:55.299 --> 08:56.702
Somebody maced you?

08:56.735 --> 08:58.637
Yeah, mace.

08:58.669 --> 08:59.972
Why?

09:00.005 --> 09:01.573
It was an accident.

09:01.606 --> 09:06.278
My landlord thought I was
robbing my own apartment.

09:06.310 --> 09:10.114
Really? Isn't your
landlord, like, 90 years old?

09:10.148 --> 09:12.418
Yeah, but she's spry.

09:13.717 --> 09:17.389
And then, uh, I fell on a glass.

09:17.422 --> 09:21.426
Hm, can I get you some ice for that?

09:21.458 --> 09:22.994
No, I'm fine.

09:23.028 --> 09:25.364
Um, do you know what you want to order?

09:25.396 --> 09:26.630
Oatmeal.

09:26.664 --> 09:28.199
- That's it?
- Yeah.

09:32.036 --> 09:36.975
Do you have anything on the
agenda for later tonight?

09:39.443 --> 09:45.317
Nothing... sleeping, so, no.

09:47.485 --> 09:51.789
Um, something to drink?

09:51.823 --> 09:53.025
Hot tea.

09:53.058 --> 09:55.394
Right... okay.

<i>Jack? Is that you?</i>

10:15.413 --> 10:16.448
Gillian?

10:16.481 --> 10:19.150
Why are you calling me, Gillian?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.586
I remember hating you.

10:20.619 --> 10:23.355
<i>Shut the fuck up! I need
you to go pick up Andrea...</i>

10:23.388 --> 10:24.289
<i>before she gets into a car and...</i>

10:24.322 --> 10:25.624
Who's Andrea?

10:25.656 --> 10:28.325
<i>My kid... she came by
your place earlier today.</i>

10:28.358 --> 10:29.693
I'm hanging up.

10:29.726 --> 10:32.329
<i>No, no, no, she just
called from a pay phone...</i>

10:32.362 --> 10:34.299
<i>and she said she's coming home soon.</i>

10:34.332 --> 10:37.101
<i>I don't want to her driving drunk.
You're the only guy around there I know.</i>

10:37.135 --> 10:40.304
Gillian, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:40.337 --> 10:41.005
<i>Andrea.</i>

10:41.039 --> 10:42.573
Repeating the name doesn't help.

10:42.606 --> 10:48.313
<i>Andrea, you dumb fuck, she said
she saw you this afternoon.</i>

10:48.346 --> 10:50.082
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

10:50.115 --> 10:51.683
She was here.

10:51.717 --> 10:55.319
<i>I know. But she's out drinking
now, because you said or did...</i>

10:55.352 --> 10:57.289
<i>something that sent her
up the fucking wall.</i>

10:57.322 --> 11:00.859
I opened the door and
she ran off. That's it.

11:00.891 --> 11:02.326
<i>You fucked it up, Jack.</i>

11:02.360 --> 11:03.829
I don't even know what I did.

11:03.861 --> 11:05.262
<i>She just wanted to meet you.</i>

11:05.295 --> 11:06.330
Why?

11:06.364 --> 11:07.566
<i>Take a guess.</i>

11:09.167 --> 11:10.435
I hate you.

11:10.467 --> 11:11.770
<i>Fuck you, Jack.</i>

11:11.803 --> 11:15.506
Abortions cost about
$300. You could afford one.

11:15.539 --> 11:18.375
<i>Just pick her up, please.</i>

11:18.409 --> 11:20.178
Where is she again?

11:20.211 --> 11:22.681
<i>Do you remember that bar, Crackles?</i>

11:22.713 --> 11:23.981
What do I do with her?

11:24.015 --> 11:26.750
<i>Just don't let her drive
home drunk as shit.</i>

11:26.784 --> 11:29.788
<i>She's got a habit of doing that. She's
had her license suspended, she's...</i>

11:29.821 --> 11:31.755
Andrea's the name?

11:31.789 --> 11:34.425
<i>Yes, Jack, Andrea... Jesus Christ.</i>

11:34.458 --> 11:37.795
All right... never call me again.

12:08.259 --> 12:09.360
Hi, there.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.264
Have you seen a young lady
with a lip ring in here today?

12:12.297 --> 12:13.832
What does she look like?

12:13.865 --> 12:15.366
A young lady with a lip ring.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.235
You her dad?

12:17.268 --> 12:18.403
She was here?

12:18.435 --> 12:19.904
Yeah... you her dad?

12:19.938 --> 12:21.405
Do you know where she is?

12:21.438 --> 12:24.476
Are you her dad?

12:24.509 --> 12:26.544
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

12:26.577 --> 12:28.914
Yes, I'm her father.

12:28.947 --> 12:31.517
- She left with Tim.
- Who's Tim?

12:33.250 --> 12:34.419
Hey!

12:36.553 --> 12:37.588
Who's Tim?

12:37.621 --> 12:38.957
He's a mailman.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.859
Where is he now?

12:40.891 --> 12:41.859
No idea.

12:41.893 --> 12:43.261
Where does he live?

12:43.294 --> 12:45.462
No... no idea.

12:45.496 --> 12:47.598
What's his last name?

12:47.631 --> 12:49.967
- Dell.
- Dell?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.569
Dell.

13:04.481 --> 13:06.851
You're about 35.

13:06.884 --> 13:07.952
What do you want?

13:07.986 --> 13:09.287
Is Andrea there?

13:09.319 --> 13:11.522
Ugh, fuck off!

13:21.632 --> 13:23.334
Hold on.

13:30.942 --> 13:32.244
Hi!

13:32.276 --> 13:33.911
- Your mother called.
- Oh.

13:33.944 --> 13:35.347
You're intimidating.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.847
Okay.

13:36.881 --> 13:41.952
Nervous, it's a big thing for me. I
have this thing with alcohol, actually.

13:41.986 --> 13:44.521
I feel bad, because you
probably were just worried...

13:44.554 --> 13:46.991
Please stop. So you're fine?

13:47.025 --> 13:48.459
- Yeah.
- Then I'm leaving.

13:48.492 --> 13:50.462
Don't die before you get to your mother's.

13:50.495 --> 13:51.363
So, that's it?

13:51.395 --> 13:52.396
Sure... I'm done.

13:52.430 --> 13:56.399
Well, I feel like we should
just... you know, um...

13:56.433 --> 13:58.403
What?

13:58.435 --> 14:00.271
Talk.

14:00.304 --> 14:01.539
What do you want to do?

14:01.572 --> 14:03.475
I could eat.

14:03.507 --> 14:08.679
Oh, um... do you mind if I stay over?

14:10.548 --> 14:14.653
So, what happened to your hand anyway?

14:14.685 --> 14:16.587
Uh...

14:19.424 --> 14:22.026
Someone shot me earlier today.

14:25.563 --> 14:31.035
Seriously? Someone shot you? With a gun?

14:31.068 --> 14:33.471
That's how you get shot.

14:33.504 --> 14:34.740
Why?

14:37.107 --> 14:38.609
I actually don't know.

14:38.643 --> 14:42.347
Hey, I keep coming back here to.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.381
Somebody' here with you. Hi, there.

14:44.414 --> 14:45.415
Hello.

14:45.449 --> 14:49.320
I just never seen you here
with anyone else, so...

14:49.353 --> 14:50.454
I'm Andrea.

14:50.487 --> 14:51.289
Cara.

14:51.322 --> 14:53.658
I think I want the eggplant parmesan.

14:53.691 --> 14:56.728
- Does he come here a lot?
- Oh, yeah, about everyday.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.530
Wow... I guess that's...

15:05.403 --> 15:06.404
Just visiting Dad.

15:06.437 --> 15:09.073
Your dad?

15:09.106 --> 15:14.411
Okay, so, you never mentioned a daughter.

15:14.444 --> 15:19.050
Um, yeah, I don't know why.

15:21.419 --> 15:25.356
Um, do you know what you want to order?

15:25.390 --> 15:28.360
I want the eggplant parmesan.

15:28.393 --> 15:31.363
I will have, chicken Caesar salad.

15:31.395 --> 15:34.064
All right, I will be right back.

15:34.097 --> 15:37.101
I, uh, don't have money, so...

15:37.135 --> 15:39.770
Then how did you end up inebriated?

15:39.803 --> 15:43.507
Vaginas are like coupon books for alcohol.

15:49.746 --> 15:53.550
So, eggplant? Not chicken or veal?

15:53.583 --> 15:55.051
I don't eat meat.

15:55.086 --> 15:59.657
Really? You look like the kind of guy
who'd eat meat every chance you'd get.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.059
If it had blood, I don't eat it.

16:02.092 --> 16:03.160
So, you're a vegetarian?

16:03.193 --> 16:04.562
I guess.

16:04.595 --> 16:07.499
Why? Bacon exists.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.533
No reason.

16:09.567 --> 16:12.003
That's noble.

16:12.035 --> 16:16.407
So, are you married now
or a like, girlfriend?

16:16.441 --> 16:17.809
We were talking about bacon.

16:17.842 --> 16:19.443
No significant other?

16:21.611 --> 16:26.451
We just met a few hours
ago, knock it down a peg.

16:26.483 --> 16:28.652
- Sorry.
- It's a little intense.

16:28.685 --> 16:32.055
Sorry, I was just curious.

16:32.088 --> 16:34.491
Are you still staying over tonight?

16:34.525 --> 16:37.694
Uh, is that all right with you if I did?

16:37.727 --> 16:39.430
How long?

16:39.463 --> 16:40.866
Two days?

18:05.283 --> 18:07.150
Ah, hot tea.

18:07.184 --> 18:09.154
Okay, hot tea.

18:38.315 --> 18:42.286
Oh, god. What? What, is everything okay?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.188
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

18:44.220 --> 18:48.292
Yeah, okay, I just forgot
where I was for a minute.

19:00.737 --> 19:01.773
What was that?

19:01.805 --> 19:05.276
Nothing, go back to sleep.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.845
Yeah, he picked me up last night.

19:08.879 --> 19:11.315
No, he found me at the diner.

19:11.349 --> 19:18.022
Yeah, yeah, well, I was
planning on finding a motel...

19:18.054 --> 19:20.658
and then just coming home in the morning.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.995
No. Yeah, I'm fine.

19:24.027 --> 19:25.963
He's fine, so far.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.798
What time is it?

19:27.832 --> 19:31.636
Hold on. I don't know,
I don't wear a watch.

19:31.669 --> 19:32.736
Who's on the phone?

19:32.769 --> 19:35.739
Mom, eh, Gillian.

19:35.773 --> 19:40.344
Sorry, anyway, I'm with
him now and we're fine...

19:44.281 --> 19:45.950
Good afternoon.

19:45.983 --> 19:47.018
Afternoon.

19:47.051 --> 19:48.886
Where'd you end up going this morning?

19:48.919 --> 19:50.287
I took a walk.

19:50.321 --> 19:52.756
What, to clear your head?

19:52.790 --> 19:55.326
Must be something finding out I exist.

19:55.359 --> 19:58.630
I'm late. I'll be back in a minute.

20:00.765 --> 20:01.999
Bye.

20:33.430 --> 20:34.865
Let's go.

20:47.378 --> 20:49.981
Talk to me.

20:50.014 --> 20:52.850
We're here to help you, okay?

20:52.882 --> 20:54.318
Okay?

20:56.019 --> 20:57.988
I think maybe you went too far.

21:11.067 --> 21:16.873
That's all? Huh? Is he okay?

21:16.907 --> 21:18.376
Don't cry, buddy.

21:22.112 --> 21:24.849
Oh, wow, you.

21:24.881 --> 21:28.852
Hey, guy, how about you turn around
and get the fuck out of here, all right?

21:28.886 --> 21:31.422
Get out of here, asshole, get out!

21:31.455 --> 21:33.890
I need the man you're killing.

21:33.923 --> 21:37.094
Oh, we're not kidding around.
Would you get this guy gone?

21:50.073 --> 21:55.880
Oh... shit, my eye! Oh, fuck, man.

22:12.028 --> 22:13.463
Where are your keys?

22:13.496 --> 22:17.502
Oh, fuck, my leg. Just get
me to a hospital, please.

22:17.534 --> 22:18.468
Where are your car keys?

22:18.502 --> 22:21.539
I... I don't know. Jack, please.

22:21.572 --> 22:25.510
Please, Jack, just get me to a hospital.

22:25.543 --> 22:26.843
Are these them?

22:26.877 --> 22:28.111
- Um...
- Are these your keys!

22:28.144 --> 22:29.179
Yeah, yeah.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.063
Hey!

22:47.096 --> 22:48.965
Okay, who are you?

22:48.998 --> 22:51.067
What's up? Someone just dropped him off.

22:52.902 --> 22:55.972
Hey, where'd you go?

22:56.005 --> 22:56.974
Nowhere.

22:57.006 --> 23:00.544
You left the room and
showed up two hours later.

23:00.578 --> 23:03.214
You went somewhere.

23:03.246 --> 23:05.882
I had to get medication.

23:05.916 --> 23:10.554
Oh... I won't ask, because I
know most people don't like...

23:10.588 --> 23:12.924
to talk about their
personal medicine stuff.

23:12.957 --> 23:16.526
Like, I used to have this
tiny addiction to Adderall...

23:16.560 --> 23:19.063
and I know I wouldn't
want to talk about it.

23:21.198 --> 23:23.601
So, what do you want to do today?

23:23.633 --> 23:26.570
I'm doing it.

23:33.177 --> 23:34.946
So, are we gonna do anything today?

23:34.978 --> 23:36.581
I'm still doing it.

23:38.114 --> 23:40.584
Ooh, do you want to get
drunk and complain about Mom?

23:40.618 --> 23:41.953
I don't drink.

23:41.986 --> 23:46.122
Oh... no, that's good.

23:46.156 --> 23:51.562
It's a good decision. No meat, no alcohol,
what about smoke? Do you smoke anything?

23:51.594 --> 23:52.594
Nope.

23:54.331 --> 23:59.904
Wow, Jesus Christ, you're boring.
I mean, what do you do all day?

23:59.937 --> 24:02.005
Nothing much.

24:03.306 --> 24:06.910
Nothing's... good.

24:06.944 --> 24:08.579
Sure.

24:08.611 --> 24:10.881
Is there a way to walk back to that bar...

24:10.915 --> 24:13.618
because I left my car there and...

24:13.650 --> 24:15.018
What time is it?

24:15.052 --> 24:16.987
Almost 6:00.

24:17.021 --> 24:18.155
Bingo!

24:24.561 --> 24:26.264
How often do you come here?

24:26.296 --> 24:29.066
At least three days a week.

24:30.100 --> 24:33.070
Well, how many times do you win?

24:33.102 --> 24:36.974
Eh, once a month.

24:37.006 --> 24:41.312
Four. Here... take this.

24:41.344 --> 24:43.046
$20, please?

24:44.581 --> 24:46.650
And how much money do
you get in that month?

24:46.684 --> 24:54.659
First game is regular bingo
or four corners... $50, $50.

24:54.691 --> 24:55.959
$100.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.995
How much did this cost?

24:58.027 --> 24:59.596
$20.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.564
That doesn't pay off, then.

25:01.598 --> 25:05.970
No, no, it doesn't.

25:06.003 --> 25:07.639
Then why do you play bingo?

25:11.074 --> 25:13.343
Because these people don't distract me.

25:13.377 --> 25:14.646
What?

25:17.014 --> 25:21.619
For something to do. I
play for something to do.

25:21.651 --> 25:23.086
Keeps me occupied.

25:26.724 --> 25:28.326
Caller's announcing.

25:30.226 --> 25:32.228
N-34.

25:32.262 --> 25:34.732
Just a line anywhere?

25:34.765 --> 25:35.999
And the four corners.

25:36.033 --> 25:37.968
B-2.

25:41.371 --> 25:46.744
And B-1, B-1...
anybody got B-1.

25:46.776 --> 25:49.080
So, I've noticed that we
only have two bingo cards...

25:49.112 --> 25:52.048
but all the other senior
citizens have like ten.

25:52.082 --> 25:53.985
I-20.

25:54.017 --> 25:56.319
I never play with more than two.

25:56.352 --> 25:58.421
I don't want to keep
track of more than that.

25:58.455 --> 26:01.258
- Oh.
- I-17.

26:01.291 --> 26:05.396
O! O-64.
O-64.

26:05.428 --> 26:07.230
Oh, ah, thanks.

26:07.264 --> 26:10.301
N-41.

26:10.333 --> 26:14.972
And the rotation continues.

26:16.407 --> 26:20.077
Well, that was something.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.312
It passes the time.

26:21.344 --> 26:23.213
So does drug use.

26:42.466 --> 26:46.303
You don't even think when you're
playing bingo. Your mind's on autopilot.

26:46.335 --> 26:49.073
No, you're definitely a
professional bingo player.

26:49.105 --> 26:50.440
Here they are.

26:51.842 --> 26:53.209
Do you like bingo?

26:53.243 --> 26:55.146
The room full of seniors bingo?

26:55.178 --> 26:57.715
- Yeah.
- I can't say I ever played.

26:57.747 --> 27:02.119
Well, would you consider it?

27:02.151 --> 27:03.219
Sure.

27:03.253 --> 27:05.156
You should come with us sometime?

27:06.390 --> 27:09.159
You play bingo?

27:09.192 --> 27:10.660
You don't look like the type.

27:10.694 --> 27:11.694
I'm less than a hundred.

27:13.330 --> 27:17.668
Um, yeah, I'll go. I work
tomorrow, but I'm off the day after.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.505
Nice, well, we don't do
anything, so we're also open.

27:22.238 --> 27:25.375
All right, um, are you ready to order?

27:25.409 --> 27:27.277
Um, I'm gonna need a minute.

27:27.311 --> 27:31.314
Okay, I gotta work on this table
and then I will be right back.

27:31.348 --> 27:33.517
- I was ready to order.
- There you go.

27:33.550 --> 27:35.219
- Where I go?
- You got a date.

27:35.252 --> 27:36.687
It's bingo.

27:36.719 --> 27:40.091
Yes, even bingo counts, when's the
last time you were with someone anyway?

27:40.123 --> 27:41.391
How old are you?

27:41.425 --> 27:44.428
- 19.
- So, 19 years.

27:46.196 --> 27:48.499
- Oh.
- Yeah.

27:48.532 --> 27:51.468
You'll be fine. No, she's
nice... and you'll have fun.

27:57.541 --> 27:58.442
Do you know him?

27:58.475 --> 27:59.776
Don't look at him.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.412
- What?
- You can see him?

28:01.445 --> 28:04.881
Yeah, why wouldn't I see him? He's solid.

28:04.915 --> 28:08.552
Just ignore his existence,
even if he speaks to you.

28:08.584 --> 28:10.386
Should I ask who that is?

28:10.419 --> 28:11.522
Not at all.

28:11.554 --> 28:13.556
- Bad guy?
- Yeah.

28:13.590 --> 28:16.260
All right, fuck.

28:26.236 --> 28:27.271
You all right?

28:27.303 --> 28:28.104
Yeah.

28:28.138 --> 28:30.207
You're kind of out there, aren't you?

28:30.239 --> 28:31.842
- Probably.
- Yeah, that's okay.

28:31.874 --> 28:34.244
Me, too.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.746
Can I talk about Mom for a sec?

28:36.780 --> 28:38.516
What happened between you two?

28:38.548 --> 28:40.483
Do you know how long your
mother and I were together?

28:40.516 --> 28:41.818
I can't say I do.

28:41.851 --> 28:45.255
A month, no, less.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.156
Really?

28:46.189 --> 28:47.291
Yeah.

28:47.323 --> 28:48.926
Were you married before Mom?

28:48.958 --> 28:50.561
- Yes.
- Really?

28:50.593 --> 28:51.861
More than twice.

28:51.894 --> 28:52.829
Are you guys ready?

28:52.862 --> 28:54.430
I am, are you?

28:54.464 --> 28:55.799
I've been ready.

28:55.832 --> 28:57.267
- Cara!
- Yeah?

28:57.301 --> 28:58.502
Phone.

28:58.534 --> 29:00.838
Ugh, yeah, I'll be right there.

29:00.871 --> 29:04.341
Sorry, so did you guys play bingo today?

29:04.373 --> 29:05.342
Sure did.

29:05.374 --> 29:06.776
Anybody win?

29:06.810 --> 29:08.412
Nobody wins in bingo.

29:12.381 --> 29:14.552
I could go for being buzzed.

29:15.585 --> 29:17.487
Okay.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.590
Can I borrow your car?

29:19.622 --> 29:24.361
Yeah, you should ask that
after the buzzed comment.

29:24.393 --> 29:25.595
I can?

29:27.296 --> 29:28.632
I don't have a car.

29:31.601 --> 29:34.470
Right, what do you need a car
for when you only go three places.

29:34.504 --> 29:36.674
That's the idea.

29:39.008 --> 29:40.443
You all right?

29:40.476 --> 29:42.580
Yeah. Yeah.

30:06.902 --> 30:09.339
- I don't see anything.
- Let's go.

30:16.713 --> 30:18.282
Where are you going?

30:18.314 --> 30:19.416
Be back in a minute.

30:19.448 --> 30:21.552
Okay.

30:32.161 --> 30:35.665
Jesus fucking Christ, that's
gotta be a fucking record.

30:35.698 --> 30:37.034
I saw him drink it.

30:37.066 --> 30:39.603
I'm just glad he didn't
kick it at the diner.

30:41.371 --> 30:42.473
All right, let's go.

30:52.983 --> 30:54.518
Aw, man, he's heavy.

30:54.551 --> 30:57.621
The metal we fucking
wrapped him in doesn't help.

30:57.653 --> 31:00.423
Fucking tired, been up too long.

31:01.691 --> 31:05.528
Agh!

31:05.562 --> 31:08.732
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
did that just fucking happen?

31:08.765 --> 31:11.068
Whoa, no, no, he's gonna
come back up, all right?

31:11.101 --> 31:15.973
Come on, Larry, asshole. Swim back up.

31:16.005 --> 31:17.507
Swim on up, asshole!

31:17.541 --> 31:19.610
Fuck, what do we dive in after him?

31:19.642 --> 31:20.678
You fucking dive in.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.512
It's fucking freezing, man!

31:22.545 --> 31:24.380
They're gonna be askin'
us what happened to Larry.

31:24.413 --> 31:25.715
What are we supposed to say then, Steve?

31:25.748 --> 31:27.450
What are we supposed to say
fucking happened to Larry?

31:27.484 --> 31:28.485
You gotta dive in!

31:28.517 --> 31:30.754
No. No, I'm not doing it.

31:30.786 --> 31:33.590
You're right, I'm sorry.
I've been cruel to...

31:33.622 --> 31:35.525
Get the fuck in the water, Steve!

31:35.559 --> 31:36.726
Agh! My eye!

31:41.630 --> 31:42.699
Whoa, whoa, is that him?

31:42.733 --> 31:44.101
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.669
Oh, come on, it's not him.

31:45.701 --> 31:47.570
Who the hell else is it
gonna be, you dickhead.

31:47.603 --> 31:48.971
It doesn't even fucking look like him!

31:49.005 --> 31:51.165
Why are you even questioning
this? Of course, it's him.

31:52.042 --> 31:53.077
Shit...

31:54.977 --> 31:56.947
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

31:56.979 --> 32:00.016
He's gotta be on uppers
or bath salts or something.

32:00.050 --> 32:02.019
- All right, go shoot him.
- I'm not going out there.

32:02.052 --> 32:04.492
- There's no way I'm stepping out of this vehicle.
- My eye...

32:05.054 --> 32:07.091
We should go, we should go, we should go.

32:07.123 --> 32:09.492
Oh, god, why is he looking at me like that?

32:09.525 --> 32:11.628
Oh, god, oh, god, chill
out, chill out, man!

32:11.660 --> 32:16.667
No, no, no! Oh god, oh god, oh god.

33:07.217 --> 33:09.520
What happened?

33:09.553 --> 33:10.821
Rain.

33:10.853 --> 33:12.188
It's not raining.

33:12.221 --> 33:15.091
It was about three miles west of here.

33:15.124 --> 33:19.496
Where were you? I mean, The Weather
Channel said nothing about water?

33:19.528 --> 33:21.664
I took a walk.

33:21.698 --> 33:24.768
When you left, you didn't say where
you were going and I mean now...

33:35.611 --> 33:37.448
You have to go now.

33:37.480 --> 33:38.614
What?

33:42.486 --> 33:43.187
Leave.

33:43.219 --> 33:44.520
Now?

33:44.553 --> 33:48.158
Yes, now... in the next 60 seconds.

33:48.190 --> 33:49.692
Wait, what's going on?

33:49.726 --> 33:51.527
Get out of my house.

33:51.561 --> 33:52.728
Seriously?

33:52.762 --> 33:53.831
Yes.

33:53.863 --> 33:55.665
I don't understand, why? What's going...

33:55.698 --> 33:57.801
Get out, you un-aborted brat.

33:57.833 --> 34:01.505
I don't want you here. No one wants you.

34:04.140 --> 34:07.911
Go on... fuck off.

34:12.181 --> 34:13.650
Fuck you.

34:15.684 --> 34:18.655
Agh!

34:53.556 --> 34:54.725
Hey.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.780
It's extrememly rude.

35:17.814 --> 35:20.751
Shut the fuck up, bitch! You're
at my door every goddamn day!

35:20.784 --> 35:22.464
Leave me the fuck alone! I turned it down!

35:23.586 --> 35:27.590
I turned it down! Leave! Goddamn it! Jeez.

35:27.624 --> 35:30.593
I pay my rent over here! What
else do you want from me, huh?

35:34.631 --> 35:36.567
See you later!

35:36.599 --> 35:40.202
Adios! Get the fuck out!

35:40.235 --> 35:42.639
Fucking suck a dick, bitch!

35:43.706 --> 35:47.010
For god sake! Hey, Lou-boy!

35:51.981 --> 35:53.916
Fuck off, douche!

36:15.805 --> 36:16.940
Mornin'.

36:16.972 --> 36:17.907
Morning.

36:17.941 --> 36:20.010
You know, you're an hour early?

36:20.043 --> 36:21.644
Yeah.

36:24.713 --> 36:25.948
How long you been here?

36:25.981 --> 36:28.651
What time is it?

36:28.684 --> 36:29.885
About 9:00.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.654
I've been here since 6:00.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.858
All right.

36:40.963 --> 36:45.668
I-17...
I-17

36:45.702 --> 36:52.042
O-75... and B-1!
Does anyone have B-1?

37:04.988 --> 37:09.026
Hey, if you're an alcoholic or
something, I can get you something else?

37:11.327 --> 37:13.130
Hey!

37:16.932 --> 37:18.401
Oh, man...

37:32.414 --> 37:34.017

39:45.849 --> 39:49.519
You just fucking got shit all over me.

39:49.552 --> 39:51.254
Man, I should fucking lay you out.

39:51.287 --> 39:53.523
You better give me money for
all the shit you just ruined.

39:53.555 --> 39:55.992
Yeah, you should give
us everything you got.

39:58.494 --> 39:59.863
You look 14.

39:59.896 --> 40:01.598
Man, suck on these nuts.

40:01.631 --> 40:04.201
And give your shit
before you start bleeding.

40:04.233 --> 40:06.969
You. How old are you?

40:07.003 --> 40:10.472
He's old enough to fuck you up.

40:10.506 --> 40:11.508
I'll take it.

41:06.162 --> 41:09.999
<i>Hello, Jack, I couldn't
find your last name.</i>

41:10.032 --> 41:15.104
<i>I just wanted you to let you know that we
are going to kill Andrea K. Huntsmen...</i>

41:15.137 --> 41:17.273
<i>if you don't show up at the docks.</i>

41:17.307 --> 41:20.310
<i>See, you decided to kill
an associate of ours, so...</i>

41:20.343 --> 41:22.678
<i>we went right ahead and
kidnapped her earlier today.</i>

41:22.711 --> 41:27.082
<i>And killed a Mrs. Gillian
Huntsman in the process.</i>

41:27.115 --> 41:28.651
<i>I didn't mean to do that.</i>

41:28.684 --> 41:30.986
<i>But you know, these
things do happen.</i>

41:31.019 --> 41:34.957
<i>Midnight at the docks, don't
call the police, blah blah blah.</i>

41:34.990 --> 41:38.160
<i>And see you then. This is
just for your information.</i>

41:38.193 --> 41:41.030
<i>Bye... when do we kill
this fucking bitch?</i>

42:01.684 --> 42:04.354
Okay.

42:04.387 --> 42:06.155
Um.

42:06.189 --> 42:07.357
Loser Syndrome?

42:07.389 --> 42:09.158
Loser Syndrome.

42:12.628 --> 42:14.231
Yeah?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.035
Hey.

42:19.068 --> 42:20.035
Hey.

42:20.068 --> 42:21.704
What's going on?

42:21.738 --> 42:24.140
I don't know. Nothing.

42:24.173 --> 42:27.410
It kind of looks like something.

42:27.443 --> 42:31.348
It's nothing. I'm fine.

42:33.615 --> 42:36.186
What was that this morning?

42:36.218 --> 42:37.253
Today?

42:37.285 --> 42:40.023
You just kinda ran out.

42:40.055 --> 42:44.994
That's right. Sorry.

42:45.028 --> 42:50.166
I just... my head was in a bad place.

42:50.198 --> 42:52.401
Oh... how are you now?

42:54.202 --> 42:55.637
Steady.

42:55.671 --> 42:57.439
That's good.

42:57.472 --> 42:59.308
- Cara!
- Yeah.

42:59.342 --> 43:00.642
You've got a call.

43:00.675 --> 43:03.212
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

43:03.246 --> 43:05.081
Just let him know to stop calling?

43:05.113 --> 43:07.416
I do, but he's a lunatic.

43:07.450 --> 43:10.454
I don't care... take care of it.

43:12.220 --> 43:15.025
I, uh, I gotta take care of this, so...

43:15.057 --> 43:16.059
Real quick, what are you havin'?

43:16.092 --> 43:18.294
Steak, rare.

43:18.327 --> 43:20.130
Okay.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.302
What about Ted? I mean,
I know he's skinny...

43:26.334 --> 43:28.037
- but you know what they say about skinny guys, right?
- Cara...

43:28.070 --> 43:29.304
your boyfriend is outside.

43:29.338 --> 43:30.807
He's not my boyfriend.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.742
I still don't care. He's
causing a disturbance.

43:33.776 --> 43:36.813
Oh, shit, shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:36.845 --> 43:39.148
Don't be a nob.

43:42.418 --> 43:43.486
Don't!

43:43.519 --> 43:45.421
Oh, they're really going at it.

43:45.454 --> 43:46.590
Is there anyone else?

43:46.622 --> 43:48.657
No, it's just the two of them,
but I'm calling the police.

43:48.691 --> 43:50.093
Oh, come on!

43:50.126 --> 43:53.662
Look, they're gonna start
throwing at each other, Norm! Fuck.

43:53.695 --> 43:56.198
Cara... what the hell's wrong with her?

43:56.231 --> 43:57.733
The guy seems borderline retarded.

43:57.767 --> 43:59.102
Yeah, you would know. Hello?

43:59.135 --> 44:03.106
Yeah, I'm at Times
Square Diner, I've got...

44:06.108 --> 44:07.811
I got it.

44:07.843 --> 44:10.746
Oh... um... cool.

44:10.780 --> 44:12.215
Give it to me!

44:14.182 --> 44:18.720
My own goddamn car back! God!

44:18.753 --> 44:21.123
Give me my goddamn purse!

44:21.157 --> 44:25.727
Uh-huh, here you go. Take it!

44:25.760 --> 44:28.532
You? What the fuck, dude?

44:32.168 --> 44:34.370
I'm talking to...

44:34.403 --> 44:38.741
You better cut that shit out, or
I will fucking floor you! I swear!

44:38.773 --> 44:40.709
Jack! Get the fuck out of here, just leave!

44:40.742 --> 44:43.479
Now, Jack! Please.

44:48.316 --> 44:49.316
Don't!

44:53.189 --> 44:54.257
I just get...

44:56.925 --> 44:58.160
Ugh...

45:01.564 --> 45:02.765
I'm taking the car!

45:02.798 --> 45:04.167
Well, I am gettin' it back!

45:04.200 --> 45:07.370
Well, whatever, bitch! Go be a whore!

45:07.403 --> 45:09.472
Oh! How am I a whore, huh?

45:09.505 --> 45:11.307
Tim, you do not take that car!

45:11.340 --> 45:13.175
Do not take the car!

45:13.209 --> 45:16.412
Goddamn it! Fuck!

45:16.445 --> 45:19.314
What? Why did you do that?

45:19.347 --> 45:20.416
You're dating Tim?

45:20.448 --> 45:22.751
No... I mean, well, I was...

45:22.785 --> 45:24.287
but we were miserably hating each other...

45:24.320 --> 45:25.889
because we co-own a
car which we both need.

45:25.921 --> 45:28.525
Oh, my god, you know Tim?

45:28.557 --> 45:29.358
A little.

45:29.392 --> 45:32.896
Oh, Jesus Christ, why did you do that?

45:32.928 --> 45:34.264
It seemed appropriate.

45:34.296 --> 45:36.398
No, it wasn't...

45:36.432 --> 45:39.836
but... thanks... I guess.

45:42.405 --> 45:44.340
Look, I know, you walk all the time.

45:44.372 --> 45:46.342
Yup. How far are you going?

45:46.374 --> 45:47.843
It's about 12 blocks.

45:47.876 --> 45:49.244
You'll be all right.

45:49.278 --> 45:52.415
Yeah. I'll be fine. Well, see ya.

45:52.447 --> 45:54.883
- Take care.
- Shit.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.629
So we live like six blocks from each other.

46:07.662 --> 46:09.331
Looks like it.

46:09.365 --> 46:10.633
Do you have the time, by the way?

46:10.666 --> 46:14.403
Oh... it's 12:48.

46:16.238 --> 46:18.407
Do you have a
middle-of-the-night appointment?

46:18.441 --> 46:22.445
I had something, but... it's over now.

46:22.477 --> 46:27.282
Oh, right, too busy
getting punched in the head?

46:27.316 --> 46:32.589
Well actually, it was probably better
than the alternative I had planned.

46:32.622 --> 46:36.326
That was amazing, by the way.

46:36.358 --> 46:38.894
You won a fight by not doing anything.

46:38.927 --> 46:41.296
Did you used to box or something?

46:41.329 --> 46:42.497
A little actually.

46:42.530 --> 46:45.367
Neat.

46:45.401 --> 46:49.439
So, what do you do anyway?

46:49.472 --> 46:52.941
I mean, I see you almost everyday and
then other than your name being Jack...

46:52.974 --> 46:55.544
I don't really know anything about you.

46:55.577 --> 46:58.614
I didn't know you had a
daughter until recently.

46:58.648 --> 47:00.650
Where is she, by the way?

47:00.682 --> 47:03.552
She's probably with her
mother at this point.

47:03.586 --> 47:05.921
Oh.

47:05.954 --> 47:08.023
Well, I grew up with split parents.

47:08.057 --> 47:10.793
She'll be all right, she seems resilient.

47:10.825 --> 47:12.293
I like to think so.

47:12.327 --> 47:17.300
And honestly, if I had to pick what
your daughter would sound and act like...

47:17.332 --> 47:19.601
...it's pretty much Andrea.

47:19.635 --> 47:20.903
That's a shame.

47:20.936 --> 47:24.039
No, no, that's a good thing.

47:24.072 --> 47:28.010
You guys have like this... bantery report.

47:29.477 --> 47:31.481
I don't know, that stuff's important.

47:31.514 --> 47:35.450
I didn't have that with my mom or my dad...

47:35.483 --> 47:39.288
and I wish I did.

47:39.322 --> 47:42.291
Did you have it with your parents?

47:49.965 --> 47:53.035
Jeez. You're kind of out there, aren't you?

47:53.068 --> 47:54.970
Someone just told me that.

47:55.003 --> 47:58.473
Well, you are.

47:58.506 --> 48:01.010
It's the normal ones you
have to be careful about.

48:01.043 --> 48:04.046
That's the truth and a half.

48:04.079 --> 48:07.482
So, what do you do?

48:07.515 --> 48:09.485
You never talk about yourself.

48:09.517 --> 48:12.021
I don't do much of anything
anymore, but when I did...

48:12.053 --> 48:15.025
I did a little bit of everything.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.463
Like what?

48:20.496 --> 48:24.700
I was kind of a bodyguard for
a while. Then I sold antiques...

48:24.733 --> 48:26.468
which probably made me the most.

48:26.501 --> 48:28.770
I owned a few businesses.

48:28.803 --> 48:33.409
Uh, construction for a while. Truck driver.

48:33.441 --> 48:36.945
Teacher for a while,
history most of the time.

48:36.979 --> 48:42.051
Military took up a good part of my life.

48:42.084 --> 48:44.520
Manager for a whole slew of businesses.

48:44.552 --> 48:52.552
Landscaper. Fisherman.
I bootlegged for a while.

48:53.061 --> 48:56.465
Wreck diver. Minor...

48:56.499 --> 49:00.803
for coal, silver, gold.

49:02.171 --> 49:06.609
Stunt man for movies for a while. Nurse.

49:06.642 --> 49:08.578
I was a medic for a while.

49:08.610 --> 49:11.813
That's when I was in the military. Cook.

49:11.847 --> 49:16.151
Prison. There's a good
amount of prison in there.

49:16.184 --> 49:20.090
Professional gambler... horse breeder.

49:22.124 --> 49:26.062
Potter. I made pots for a while.

49:26.095 --> 49:30.733
Tinsmith, then a blacksmith.

49:30.765 --> 49:33.535
Retail for almost everything.

49:33.568 --> 49:34.771
Mechanic...

49:36.771 --> 49:38.807
- Wow.
- Yeah.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.610
That's just a lot.

49:41.644 --> 49:43.111
Yeah.

49:43.144 --> 49:46.416
You're like a
Jack-of-all-trades.

49:49.818 --> 49:53.555
Oh, god... um...

49:53.588 --> 49:58.527
Well, I went to business school
for four years to be a waitress.

49:58.561 --> 50:01.430
What did you want to do?

50:01.463 --> 50:05.601
I wanted to own a coffee
shop and I did for a while.

50:05.633 --> 50:11.106
And it failed, and
then, um, I got divorced.

50:11.139 --> 50:15.510
And I became a waitress
to get back on my feet.

50:15.543 --> 50:16.711
And I guess I still am,

50:16.744 --> 50:20.849
because I'm still at
the diner, which I hate.

50:20.883 --> 50:25.555
But I do enjoy the lack of responsibility.

50:25.588 --> 50:27.089
I was never a waiter.

50:27.122 --> 50:29.459
You'd be terrible at it.

50:29.492 --> 50:31.428
You're right, I would.

50:33.561 --> 50:36.799
That is the most I've
heard you say, by the way.

50:38.700 --> 50:42.637
That's the most I've said in years.

50:42.671 --> 50:45.508
Well, I'm glad I was here for it.

50:45.541 --> 50:48.177
This is me, by the way.

50:48.209 --> 50:52.215
God, I am such a wimp. You
walk to the diner everyday?

50:52.247 --> 50:53.816
I like walking.

50:53.849 --> 51:00.622
Walking, bingo, and getting punched in
the head. I know three things you like now.

51:00.655 --> 51:03.625
That sums me up.

51:03.659 --> 51:08.198
Well, thanks again.

51:38.727 --> 51:39.996
Okay.

52:25.740 --> 52:28.043
This could be bad.

53:30.338 --> 53:32.074
Nope.

54:14.950 --> 54:16.390
If you're not expected to be here...

54:16.418 --> 54:18.787
then you're not coming in.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.756
Let me in, Gary.

54:22.890 --> 54:24.693
- Jack?
- Yeah.

54:24.727 --> 54:26.696
- Haven't see you in a while.
- Yeah.

54:26.729 --> 54:28.464
If you're not expected to be
here, you're not coming in.

54:28.497 --> 54:29.865
- Open the door!
- Hey, take a walk!

54:29.898 --> 54:32.068
You're not coming in,
especially this early.

54:32.101 --> 54:33.869
Go ask Tom if I can come in.

54:33.901 --> 54:36.005
- Tom's dead!
- Tom's dead?

54:36.037 --> 54:37.740
Yeah, he sure as hell is.

54:38.974 --> 54:40.443
Yeah, he is dead.

54:40.476 --> 54:41.843
Who's in charge then?

54:41.876 --> 54:43.044
Alex.

54:43.077 --> 54:44.146
Go ask Alex.

54:44.178 --> 54:45.414
He's getting ready for bed.

54:45.447 --> 54:47.749
Then he can talk.

54:49.918 --> 54:51.753
All right.

55:03.765 --> 55:06.401
Hey, man! Outside!

55:06.434 --> 55:07.769
We need to talk.

55:10.838 --> 55:13.875
Hey, Jack. Wow.

55:13.909 --> 55:15.811
I see you found your way in.

55:15.843 --> 55:17.880
Come on, man... we're going back outside.

55:17.912 --> 55:19.514
No, it's all right. Get some sleep.

55:19.548 --> 55:20.616
You don't need me around?

55:20.648 --> 55:23.418
That's all right. We're
fine. Jack, you need anything?

55:23.452 --> 55:24.887
- Smoothie?
- No.

55:24.919 --> 55:27.523
See? Look, we're good, all
right? Good job tonight.

55:27.555 --> 55:29.124
Okay. See you tonight.

55:29.157 --> 55:31.092
Hey, you, ah, leave that door open?

55:31.126 --> 55:33.796
I didn't close it.

55:33.829 --> 55:35.832
Fucking Jack.

55:37.965 --> 55:41.836
Hm. So, Jack

55:41.869 --> 55:44.105
what'd you think of that new door?

55:44.139 --> 55:47.409
It's the best we could do
to replace your security.

55:47.441 --> 55:50.813
I think if someone wants
to get in, they can get in.

55:50.845 --> 55:56.017
Oh, heh, so where've you been?

55:56.050 --> 55:59.053
I mean, you seemed to fall off the map...

55:59.086 --> 56:01.791
after you "retired" is that the word?

56:01.823 --> 56:04.959
I really haven't done much of anything
since I stopped working for Tom.

56:04.992 --> 56:09.465
Yeah, Dad was devastated
when you went and did that.

56:09.497 --> 56:11.432
I don't care.

56:11.465 --> 56:14.402
Did you order a kidnapping
on an Andrea Huntsman?

56:14.436 --> 56:17.072
Excuse me. Who's that?

56:17.104 --> 56:18.573
Friend of the family.

56:18.606 --> 56:23.445
Ooh, family. Never
heard you mention family.

56:23.477 --> 56:27.849
Was beginning to think that you
just crawled out of the ground.

56:27.883 --> 56:30.119
Answer my question.

56:30.151 --> 56:32.521
I don't know her, all right?

56:32.553 --> 56:35.490
And besides, that stuff
was my dad's racket.

56:35.523 --> 56:37.458
I just own this club now.

56:37.492 --> 56:39.961
Is that a no?

56:39.994 --> 56:43.565
Yes, that's a no, Jesus, Jack!

56:43.599 --> 56:46.568
Do you have anything besides
being ambiguous and hostile?

56:46.602 --> 56:49.071
Have you heard about
the kidnapping? Anything?

56:49.104 --> 56:53.108
No, no, I've never even heard of...

56:53.140 --> 56:54.175
Andrea Huntsman.

56:54.209 --> 56:56.579
"Andrea Huntsman!"

56:56.611 --> 57:01.150
All right! Until you brought
her up. Same thing with you.

57:01.182 --> 57:03.552
You weren't even on my radar...

57:03.584 --> 57:07.622
until Gary mentioned your name like
30 seconds before you walked in.

57:10.224 --> 57:12.961
...drugs, or push anything!

57:12.994 --> 57:15.163
I just run the place.

57:15.197 --> 57:18.568
- Seriously.
- All right.

57:20.235 --> 57:21.938
Aren't you gonna ask about Dad?

57:25.307 --> 57:26.876
I heard he was dead.

57:26.909 --> 57:29.311
Nice to hear that your
finger's on the pulse. Hm?

57:29.343 --> 57:31.246
His cardiac pump fail?

57:31.280 --> 57:34.383
Yeah, must have died out a short
time after the car ran him over.

57:34.416 --> 57:35.551
Hm.

57:35.584 --> 57:40.489
Hey, if you need work again,
I can get you a bouncer's gig.

57:40.521 --> 57:43.992
All right? If not here, somewhere else.

57:44.026 --> 57:45.527
You'll never see me again.

57:45.559 --> 57:47.329
All right...

57:48.697 --> 57:52.001
Good luck! With... everything.

58:17.959 --> 58:20.262
I-17.

58:30.072 --> 58:31.673
Hey, he's coming.

59:16.684 --> 59:18.152
Hey.

59:18.186 --> 59:19.421
What's happening?

59:19.454 --> 59:20.756
Um, coffee?

59:20.789 --> 59:23.258
No. What? No.

59:23.291 --> 59:25.026
- No, no, no.
- Oops, sorry.

59:25.059 --> 59:27.996
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

59:28.030 --> 59:30.064
Help.

59:35.269 --> 59:38.239
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

59:38.273 --> 59:39.675
Okay.

01:00:13.275 --> 01:00:14.476
Are you ready to order?

01:00:14.508 --> 01:00:16.411
- Sit down.
- No.

01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:17.479
Sit down.

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:19.081
What is going on?

01:00:19.113 --> 01:00:21.383
Please sit down.

01:00:23.318 --> 01:00:25.254
Oh, god, holy shit!

01:00:25.287 --> 01:00:27.189
- Huh?
- Your back...

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:37.466
Oh, my god, Jack, you're
bleeding. Are you okay?

01:00:37.499 --> 01:00:40.235
Yeah... ice pick.

01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:42.170
- Sit down.
- No, no...

01:00:42.204 --> 01:00:45.441
No, I... I am gonna go get you some towels.

01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:48.443
Cara... sit down.

01:00:48.477 --> 01:00:49.512
Sit down.

01:00:57.485 --> 01:00:59.353
You were supposed to be off today.

01:00:59.387 --> 01:01:01.789
Uh, yeah, um, Georgia called in sick.

01:01:01.822 --> 01:01:03.691
Oh, my god, what is going on?

01:01:03.724 --> 01:01:05.360
Don't worry about it.

01:01:08.863 --> 01:01:10.432
Are they here because of you?

01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:12.267
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.102
Okay, who are they, Jack?

01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:16.505
I don't know. some kind
of low-class mafia, maybe.

01:01:16.537 --> 01:01:19.440
And what do they want with you?

01:01:19.474 --> 01:01:21.142
I don't know.

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:23.511
They showed up a few days
ago, and we had interactions.

01:01:23.544 --> 01:01:24.780
Oh, my god.

01:01:24.813 --> 01:01:26.347
Did you get your car back?

01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:31.887
Um, yeah.

01:01:31.919 --> 01:01:32.787
Can I get a ride?

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.322
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.358
- Okay.
- Good.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.360
Now you should go sit
over with your co-workers.

01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:41.464
- Why?
- You'll understand in a minute.

01:01:48.202 --> 01:01:49.771
Fuck.

01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:58.546
See, I told you! What did I tell you?

01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:19.167
- Get off me!
- Let's go!

01:02:20.468 --> 01:02:21.803
Not the time for that.

01:02:21.836 --> 01:02:25.474
What the fuck is going on?

01:02:25.506 --> 01:02:28.510
Oh, holy shit, you need an ambulance.

01:02:28.543 --> 01:02:30.278
- Come on!
- No, I...

01:02:33.447 --> 01:02:35.383
Hang tight for a minute.

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:39.554
What? Jack... Jack!

01:03:00.941 --> 01:03:03.678
What in god's name are you doing?

01:03:05.579 --> 01:03:07.415
Will he fit in your trunk?

01:03:07.448 --> 01:03:08.550
Put him down.

01:03:08.582 --> 01:03:09.818
Can he fit in your trunk?

01:03:09.851 --> 01:03:12.287
No, you are not putting him in my trunk!

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.588
Why not? He's not dead.

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:15.824
No!

01:03:15.856 --> 01:03:17.592
They have Andrea.

01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:22.264
- Your daughter?
- Yeah, my daughter.

01:03:22.296 --> 01:03:26.399
They have her, and she maybe
already dead, but I have to try.

01:03:26.434 --> 01:03:28.437
No, no, I don't believe that.

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.305
- Why not?
- God, I don't know.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:31.473
- I don't know.
- We need to go.

01:03:31.506 --> 01:03:34.009
No, no, no, fuck you, Jack!

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:36.410
Cara, you said you'd give me a ride.

01:03:36.443 --> 01:03:41.550
Uh, well, Jesus Christ, I
was confused and terrified.

01:03:41.582 --> 01:03:44.220
I'll give you one million dollars, cash.

01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:50.324
Where do you have a million dollars?

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:52.394
I have one millions dollars. Honest.

01:03:52.427 --> 01:03:53.629
One million dollars?

01:03:53.662 --> 01:03:56.298
Life-changing money.

01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:14.582
- Is that my tool box?
- Yeah.

01:04:14.615 --> 01:04:18.253
- Can I use your too...
- Could you just not look at me?

01:04:20.088 --> 01:04:24.993
It's just the... you know, the
blood and the holes in your head.

01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:28.697
Oh, god, just don't look at me!

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:30.666
Okay.

01:04:50.418 --> 01:04:51.753
Can we go now?

01:04:51.785 --> 01:04:54.689
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:54.722 --> 01:04:59.327
If I leave the bullets
in, it'll heal over...

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.996
and I'll get migraines.

01:05:05.633 --> 01:05:09.705
But you... god, you have
no problem doing that?

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:13.409
I have pliers in my head. It hurts.

01:05:14.709 --> 01:05:16.411
I don't... I don't know how that works.

01:05:16.443 --> 01:05:18.746
How come you're not
brain dead or something?

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.615
I should be.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.660
But I'm not.

01:05:31.693 --> 01:05:34.129
Oh, god.

01:05:34.162 --> 01:05:35.664
Can we go?

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.035
Jack? What are you gonna do with him?

01:05:40.068 --> 01:05:41.069
Talk to him.

01:05:41.102 --> 01:05:43.004
Well, he's unconscious.

01:05:43.037 --> 01:05:44.773
Not right away.

01:05:44.805 --> 01:05:45.807
What are you gonna do when you do...

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.108
Jack?

01:05:49.677 --> 01:05:51.613
Ruth.

01:05:51.646 --> 01:05:54.416
You wouldn't know where
Ben has been, would you?

01:05:54.448 --> 01:05:55.816
Ben?

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:58.552
The young man who lives across from you.

01:05:58.586 --> 01:06:00.822
Uh, no, no.

01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:05.726
Well, I haven't seen him for a few
days and well, I was wondering...

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.397
if he'd gone to sleep
at a friend's home or...

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:12.734
maybe gone away on vacation,
but if he did, he should tell me.

01:06:12.767 --> 01:06:15.504
If I see him, I'll let you know.

01:06:15.537 --> 01:06:18.540
Thank you, take care then.

01:06:18.572 --> 01:06:19.673
Hello.

01:06:19.706 --> 01:06:21.109
Hi.

01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:36.892
- Ugh, take it easy, man.
- Ah, fuck.

01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:13.755
Remigny, 1914.

01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:17.858
That was France.

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:21.196
I had a hard time
readjusting to the language.

01:08:21.228 --> 01:08:23.631
It changed quite a bit since
the last time I needed it.

01:08:23.665 --> 01:08:24.799
This is you?

01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:25.966
Yeah.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.638
It's not your dad or your granddad?

01:08:31.572 --> 01:08:33.274
I'm not even sure if I had a father.

01:08:33.308 --> 01:08:37.778
This person, in this picture, is you?

01:08:37.812 --> 01:08:39.581
Yeah.

01:08:39.613 --> 01:08:41.182
From 1914?

01:08:41.214 --> 01:08:42.182
Yeah.

01:08:42.215 --> 01:08:44.285
I don't believe that.

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:45.318
Okay.

01:08:51.858 --> 01:08:53.627
How?

01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:55.263
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

01:08:55.295 --> 01:08:56.564
I mean, I don't know.

01:08:56.598 --> 01:08:58.300
That doesn't make any sense.

01:08:58.332 --> 01:08:59.968
I didn't say it would.

01:09:04.272 --> 01:09:07.309
Wine is supposed to mature with age...

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.010
but I think 450 years may make it bitter.

01:09:10.044 --> 01:09:11.613
What?

01:09:11.645 --> 01:09:12.981
It's British.

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:20.889
And that wasn't wine.

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:23.791
Okay.

01:09:23.825 --> 01:09:25.693
No.

01:09:25.727 --> 01:09:27.962
Nope... it is not possible.

01:09:29.964 --> 01:09:32.968
You just saw me put pliers in
my head to pull out a bullet.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.301
Old age was never a concern of mine.

01:09:35.335 --> 01:09:37.638
That means you're over...

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.710
150 years old.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.045
Not even close.

01:09:45.078 --> 01:09:46.814
How old are you?

01:09:46.848 --> 01:09:48.683
I have no idea.

01:09:48.715 --> 01:09:50.718
But I'm in the Bible,
if that means anything.

01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:52.321
What?

01:09:53.353 --> 01:09:54.755
No.

01:09:54.789 --> 01:09:57.258
It is pronounced "Cayenne"...

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:59.628
but I'm known as Cain.

01:10:04.331 --> 01:10:06.000
I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:10:06.034 --> 01:10:08.870
I'm going to go interrogate
the man in my bathroom.

01:10:10.338 --> 01:10:12.707
Your money's there.

01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:15.809
I can just leave?

01:10:15.843 --> 01:10:18.813
I don't see why not?

01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:21.383
You'll never see me again.

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:52.781
Oh, man, what are you doin'?

01:10:55.782 --> 01:10:58.419
I'm not a fan of nine millimeters.

01:10:58.452 --> 01:11:00.722
I prefer something that can go through me.

01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:02.356
Yeah, okay.

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:17.839
Is Derrick someone worth speaking to?

01:11:17.871 --> 01:11:20.909
I... I don't... I don't know.

01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:22.944
Do you do illegal activities with Derrick?

01:11:22.977 --> 01:11:28.049
Uh... ah, yeah, yeah. What are you gonna...

01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:30.751
Hello.

01:11:30.785 --> 01:11:31.753
<i>Stevie!</i>

01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:33.221
No.

01:11:33.254 --> 01:11:35.090
<i>Then why in the holy fuck
are you handling a phone...</i>

01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:37.125
<i>that's not yours, where's Steve?</i>

01:11:44.464 --> 01:11:46.333
He's tied up in my bathroom right now.

01:11:46.366 --> 01:11:48.135
<i>Tied up in... who are you?</i>

01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:49.403
Where's Andrea?

01:11:49.437 --> 01:11:50.205
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:11:50.237 --> 01:11:51.639
Where's Andrea?

01:11:51.673 --> 01:11:54.275
<i>Are you that Jack scumbag
that's giving me trouble?</i>

01:11:54.308 --> 01:11:55.476
I'm Jack.

01:11:55.509 --> 01:11:57.812
<i>- Motherfucker!
- Put Steve on the phone.</i>

01:11:57.844 --> 01:11:59.179
Where's Andrea?

01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:01.782
<i>Put him on the fucking
phone, you fucking fuck!</i>

01:12:09.022 --> 01:12:10.991
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:13.065
Yeah, yeah, the girl...
the girl with the lip thing?

01:12:13.094 --> 01:12:14.162
That's her.

01:12:14.195 --> 01:12:16.865
Yeah... that was us.

01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:18.365
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:12:18.398 --> 01:12:21.001
We were hired, I think.
I mean, I'm kind of new.

01:12:21.035 --> 01:12:25.039
I'm not really the guy
to talk to about that.

01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:26.840
Where is she?

01:12:26.874 --> 01:12:27.974
I don't know that, either.

01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:30.178
We just dropped her off to
the guy that hired us... so...

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:32.012
You weren't at the docks last night?

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:33.781
I don't even know what that means.

01:12:33.814 --> 01:12:35.517
I got a call, that if I
didn't show up at the docks...

01:12:35.549 --> 01:12:36.918
at midnight, they'd kill her.

01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:39.420
Oh, yeah, last night, right?

01:12:39.452 --> 01:12:40.521
Midnight.

01:12:40.554 --> 01:12:44.025
Yeah, no, we... they dropped
her off earlier than that.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:47.095
Maybe around 5:00?

01:12:47.128 --> 01:12:50.865
- To who?
- I don't know, man, please?

01:12:50.897 --> 01:12:54.535
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.

01:12:54.568 --> 01:12:56.804
- Yeah. <i>
- Never hold me on the phone.</i>

01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:58.139
<i>What's wrong with your fucking head?</i>

01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:00.508
<i>This isn't a fucking
game. I'm not playing.</i>

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.577
Who did you drop Andrea
Huntsman off to yesterday?

01:13:03.611 --> 01:13:09.217
<i>Stop fucking interrupting me, you fucking
fuck! What the fuck is wrong with you? I...</i>

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:10.251
Derrick again.

01:13:10.284 --> 01:13:10.884
Can I talk to him?

01:13:10.918 --> 01:13:12.821
What are you going to say?

01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:16.423
I'm gonna tell him that I am fine
and he should leave you alone.

01:13:16.456 --> 01:13:17.023
You'll do that?

01:13:17.058 --> 01:13:18.393
Yeah, I don't want to die.

01:13:18.425 --> 01:13:21.963
<i>Put him on the fucking
phone, you fucking fuck!</i>

01:13:21.995 --> 01:13:26.834
Hey, it's me, Derrick. No, no, it's Steve.

01:13:26.867 --> 01:13:30.071
No, just talk slower, okay?

01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:36.143
No, he hasn't hurt me...
again, not since the diner.

01:13:36.177 --> 01:13:40.180
Could be worse. No, no, I
don't think that's a good idea.

01:13:40.214 --> 01:13:46.054
No, that's a bad idea. That
was bad, no, no, don't do that.

01:13:46.086 --> 01:13:47.955
He... he hung up.

01:13:50.057 --> 01:13:52.059
What's happening?

01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:53.561
They're sending someone over.

01:13:53.594 --> 01:13:55.964
- Here?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:57.030
They're right outside?

01:13:57.063 --> 01:13:58.900
- Yeah.
- Do you know who they're sending?

01:13:58.933 --> 01:14:01.002
- Personally?
- Yeah.

01:14:01.035 --> 01:14:05.039
Yeah, I mean, a little bit. I mean, it's
Vinny, he plays pinball, right, so...

01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:07.207
Would you be broken up if I murdered him?

01:14:07.241 --> 01:14:08.576
Are you gonna kill me?

01:14:08.608 --> 01:14:10.879
- Probably not.
- Then I got no problem with it.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.648
Ugh... he's here.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.915
Oh, fuck, man, I'm sorry.

01:14:14.948 --> 01:14:16.617
How did you find me anyway?

01:14:16.651 --> 01:14:20.220
The guy we dropped the girl off to, he gave
us your hang contact info and hang out areas.

01:14:20.254 --> 01:14:25.994
You know, we were... they were,
uh, mad about the dock thing.

01:14:27.929 --> 01:14:29.063
Good to know.

01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:33.200
Yeah... yeah, thanks. Holy, fuck.

01:14:38.638 --> 01:14:41.074
Here he is!

01:14:41.107 --> 01:14:42.309
You were supposed to leave.

01:14:42.343 --> 01:14:44.178
I needed a minute.

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.313
Shut up.

01:14:46.347 --> 01:14:47.348
Let's go, Jack.

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.082
All right, leave her behind.

01:14:49.116 --> 01:14:52.053
Fine, whatever... come on!

01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:07.168
Again?

01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:09.570
- I know.
- Oh, my god.

01:15:09.603 --> 01:15:11.706
Are you good to go now,
because I'm leaving?

01:15:11.738 --> 01:15:15.343
Yeah, are you sure I can have this?

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:18.312
Go nuts. I'll sell something
if I need the money.

01:15:31.092 --> 01:15:32.727
See you around.

01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:35.095
What, are we done? You're not gonna...

01:15:35.129 --> 01:15:36.997
Looks like it.

01:17:08.789 --> 01:17:13.760
Leginum... Convictio...

01:17:13.794 --> 01:17:20.233
Scientia... V er titia.

01:18:33.907 --> 01:18:35.509
Hey, up.

01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:44.418
Oh, wow, Jack. What's shakin'?

01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:47.855
Those mobsters you owe money
to, do you know who they are?

01:18:47.888 --> 01:18:49.890
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:49.924 --> 01:18:52.293
The mobsters who split your leg?

01:18:52.326 --> 01:18:54.362
Oh, yeah, hard to forget.

01:18:54.394 --> 01:18:55.763
Do you have any idea who they were?

01:18:55.796 --> 01:18:59.799
No, I've never seen them before. I
think they're more like hired goons.

01:18:59.832 --> 01:19:01.936
Are you supposed to be in here?

01:19:01.969 --> 01:19:05.607
Sure. Where'd you take the loan out from?

01:19:08.342 --> 01:19:11.845
I met up with some guy to give me a loan...

01:19:11.879 --> 01:19:15.249
to pay off my student loans.

01:19:15.281 --> 01:19:17.317
It was at some bar-like thing.

01:19:17.351 --> 01:19:18.818
What's it called?

01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:21.555
Um, Arcudi's.

01:19:21.589 --> 01:19:25.193
The head honcho there, last
name happen to be Miller?

01:19:25.226 --> 01:19:27.361
No, no, no, no, Arcudi.

01:19:27.393 --> 01:19:30.430
Yeah, I think his name
was the same as the bar.

01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:32.500
Does a first name come to mind?

01:19:32.532 --> 01:19:35.902
Alex. Alex Arcudi.

01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:39.874
I didn't think he'd ever
do something like that.

01:19:39.906 --> 01:19:46.546
But, uh, Jack... I never got
a chance to say thank you.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.483
You know, I...

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:54.655
No! No! You said I would
never see you again...

01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:56.556
and here you are, an hour later.

01:19:56.589 --> 01:19:58.425
I need a car and a driver this time.

01:19:58.459 --> 01:20:01.229
You're a murdering lunatic. Go steal a car.

01:20:01.262 --> 01:20:03.264
I need someone to take Andrea.

01:20:06.599 --> 01:20:08.369
You know where Andrea is?

01:20:08.402 --> 01:20:10.905
- I think so.
- Fuck! Fuck.

01:20:10.937 --> 01:20:13.873
If that's the case, I need someone
on standby when things come together.

01:20:13.906 --> 01:20:17.344
No, I am so fucking screwed
up from tonight, Jack.

01:20:17.378 --> 01:20:20.548
If you do it, I'll give
you this duffel bag...

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:25.252
and your family, and your family's
family will never have to work again.

01:20:25.286 --> 01:20:29.690
I don't know what you don't
understand about this. I refuse.

01:20:29.723 --> 01:20:31.392
Okay?

01:20:31.424 --> 01:20:34.494
You're probably just gonna go
kill another room full of people.

01:20:34.527 --> 01:20:35.996
- You are?
- Probably.

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:38.499
Come on! Fuck!

01:20:44.037 --> 01:20:45.438
So, you're like a vam...

01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:48.009
Can we not speak of it.

01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:50.510
Are you telling me that you guys exist?

01:20:50.544 --> 01:20:54.616
Yes, but I'm it.

01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:04.491
How come you don't have the... teeth?

01:21:07.361 --> 01:21:08.696
Why would I need them?

01:21:10.563 --> 01:21:12.967
Um, that means that you...

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.673
No, don't, don't. Stop... please.

01:21:19.772 --> 01:21:21.675
Okay.

01:21:26.379 --> 01:21:31.551
So, the... the Civil
War... what was that like?

01:21:35.555 --> 01:21:39.360
I don't know. I was in China.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.469
Here we are.

01:21:50.737 --> 01:21:53.374
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I was going to.

01:21:53.406 --> 01:21:55.742
Give me your telephone number, so I can
call and let you know what's going on.

01:21:55.776 --> 01:21:58.546
609-555-4382.

01:21:58.579 --> 01:21:59.546
- Okay.
- 609...

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.715
I got it.

01:22:02.816 --> 01:22:04.518
Right, of course you do.

01:22:08.388 --> 01:22:09.622
Is that a finger?

01:22:09.656 --> 01:22:10.524
Let me in, Gary.

01:22:10.557 --> 01:22:12.693
Not tonight, Jack. Fuck off somewhere else.

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:13.994
Open the door.

01:22:14.027 --> 01:22:15.330
Not happening, Jack.

01:22:34.647 --> 01:22:37.650
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, where
do you think you're going?

01:22:37.683 --> 01:22:39.652
Hey, buddy, where you going?

01:22:39.686 --> 01:22:42.590
Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you!

01:22:46.125 --> 01:22:48.728
What the fuck was that?

01:22:48.762 --> 01:22:50.398
Did you fucking shoot somebody?

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.098
Man, didn't you hear that shit?

01:22:52.131 --> 01:22:54.101
He just fucking murdered Gary!

01:22:54.134 --> 01:22:55.703
- Who?
- That dude!

01:22:55.736 --> 01:22:57.171
Who the fuck did you shoot?

01:22:57.204 --> 01:22:58.706
Also, that dude!

01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:00.174
I don't get it.

01:23:00.206 --> 01:23:01.842
You might want to clear out.

01:23:07.714 --> 01:23:09.117
Okay.

01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:17.759
Agh!

01:23:45.219 --> 01:23:46.454
Are you Derrick?

01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:47.822
Yeah, motherfucker!

01:24:20.286 --> 01:24:23.557
I'm gonna have to call you in a bit.

01:24:23.589 --> 01:24:24.624
Where's Andrea?

01:24:24.657 --> 01:24:25.558
Where's Gary?

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:27.661
Do you really want to
slow this process down?

01:24:27.693 --> 01:24:31.531
Fuck! Agh! No!

01:24:31.564 --> 01:24:33.500
It wasn't supposed to play like this!

01:24:33.534 --> 01:24:35.603
What does that mean?

01:24:41.842 --> 01:24:44.844
Oh, god, that's right. You're strong.

01:24:44.878 --> 01:24:46.514
Yup.

01:24:51.183 --> 01:24:53.553
Don't go anywhere.

01:24:53.586 --> 01:24:56.756
Those are called books, Jack!

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:58.125
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:14.909
Get away from me. No, don't.

01:25:23.584 --> 01:25:27.621
Andrea... it's me, Jack.

01:25:27.653 --> 01:25:30.223
I'm getting you out of here.

01:25:45.304 --> 01:25:46.773
Can you walk?

01:25:46.807 --> 01:25:48.776
I...

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:51.644
Okay, okay. Stay here.

01:25:51.678 --> 01:25:53.247
I'll be right back.

01:25:57.851 --> 01:26:01.321
Shit, I didn't get anywhere!

01:26:01.354 --> 01:26:05.692
Ow, agh.

01:26:12.299 --> 01:26:13.867
I have Andrea.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.972
Meet me outside the front
door. I'll be right there.

01:26:18.004 --> 01:26:22.308
I have to say, I'm shocked...

01:26:22.342 --> 01:26:24.612
shocked that you came back for her.

01:26:24.644 --> 01:26:28.816
I didn't... you're not the
reason I'm here, either.

01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:30.617
All this is for me.

01:26:32.786 --> 01:26:35.022
What the hell you doing?

01:26:35.054 --> 01:26:36.255
I want you to stay put.

01:26:36.289 --> 01:26:37.992
No, no, no!

01:26:38.025 --> 01:26:40.393
No, no, no!

01:26:40.427 --> 01:26:42.662
Agh!

01:26:46.433 --> 01:26:47.835
I'll be back.

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:52.005
Whatever!

01:26:54.875 --> 01:26:58.379
Oh, my god... she needs an ambulance.

01:26:58.411 --> 01:27:01.714
No... she'd be the last
priority if they came here.

01:27:01.747 --> 01:27:03.317
Now, hold on, what do you want me to do?

01:27:03.349 --> 01:27:06.419
Take her to the hospital,
forget you ever knew me.

01:27:06.452 --> 01:27:08.856
No, no, Jack, she's really hurt.

01:27:08.888 --> 01:27:10.323
Oh, my god, no. I need help.

01:27:10.357 --> 01:27:11.959
- You'll make it.
- Okay, what are you going?

01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:13.059
I'm staying.

01:27:13.093 --> 01:27:14.361
Jack, what the hell does that mean?

01:27:14.393 --> 01:27:16.664
It means I'm staying,
now get her out of here!

01:27:16.696 --> 01:27:21.067
No, Jack! Jack! Jack! Fuck.

01:27:22.436 --> 01:27:22.836
Okay.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:27.840
Oh...
ha-ha-ha.

01:27:27.874 --> 01:27:32.112
Is there anything I can
say to make you leave.

01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:38.818
I've killed nine-year-olds
for no reason at all.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.690
What makes you think you have a chance?

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:51.098
Heh-heh... oh, fuck!

01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:53.467
What was the camera for in the bathroom?

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.336
Oh...

01:27:56.369 --> 01:28:01.909
we were gonna beat the shit out
of Andrea and mail it to you.

01:28:03.744 --> 01:28:06.345
Why would you do that?

01:28:06.379 --> 01:28:08.849
Piss you off.

01:28:08.881 --> 01:28:10.451
Why?

01:28:10.483 --> 01:28:13.821
Because, Jack!

01:28:13.853 --> 01:28:20.827
You're special, and shooting you
just doesn't have the same impact...

01:28:20.861 --> 01:28:24.064
as it does on a normal person!

01:28:24.097 --> 01:28:29.737
You kidnapped and tortured
Andrea to get to me?

01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:33.941
You put it together, Jack. Yay.

01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:40.146
Oh, come on!

01:28:40.179 --> 01:28:45.018
Agh, my fucking ankle!

01:28:54.126 --> 01:28:55.995
Fuck!

01:28:58.932 --> 01:29:01.367
So you hired outside contractors...

01:29:01.401 --> 01:29:03.336
so you could claim anonymity.

01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:04.338
Yeah.

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:06.205
And then I guess you
found out I was involved...

01:29:06.238 --> 01:29:08.207
when I helped Jeremy
out with his loan thing.

01:29:08.241 --> 01:29:10.511
Oh, fucking Jeremy.

01:29:10.544 --> 01:29:12.446
And then you told them where to find me...

01:29:12.478 --> 01:29:15.448
and they found out about Andrea?

01:29:15.482 --> 01:29:21.822
I thought she was some weekend
prostitute or something along those lines.

01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:25.992
I was shocked to find out
you actually had a kid.

01:29:26.026 --> 01:29:27.427
Didn't really work out.

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.997
No. No, it didn't.

01:29:31.031 --> 01:29:35.435
This grudge we have, I'm assuming
it's from me murdering your father.

01:29:35.468 --> 01:29:38.104
Fucking aye, cockhead!

01:29:38.138 --> 01:29:40.207
How'd you find out?

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:46.546
Really? Day you left, Dad
died, everyone had an alibi.

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:51.018
Ruled you in. Was it really
that much of a stretch?

01:29:57.924 --> 01:30:01.961
Well, I like to stay under the radar...

01:30:01.995 --> 01:30:04.965
but your dad had other ideas.

01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:08.201
So, that's that.

01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:12.139
Were you gonna kill Andrea?

01:30:13.639 --> 01:30:16.576
And refrain from lying.

01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.277
How would you know if I'm lying?

01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:20.013
You'll say no.

01:30:20.045 --> 01:30:23.916
- Then there's your answer.
- Hmph.

01:30:43.036 --> 01:30:45.906
Jack!

01:30:47.674 --> 01:30:51.578
Jack, do you know my blood type?

01:30:51.611 --> 01:30:55.983
Jack! Huh? What's my blood type?

01:30:56.015 --> 01:30:58.518
You know my blood type?

01:31:01.153 --> 01:31:05.025
- Nope. Not yet.
- Agh!

01:31:08.961 --> 01:31:15.268
Jack, Jack, I hate you. I hate you!

01:31:27.613 --> 01:31:30.918
I was doing pretty well for a while.

01:31:30.951 --> 01:31:34.321
I was walking the tight rope of sobriety.

01:31:36.156 --> 01:31:41.195
Then your revenge stunt made
me fall right off the wagon.

01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:52.972
I'm going to kill you.
I want you to know that.

01:31:55.642 --> 01:31:59.679
But I want you to know,
I'm going to eat you.

01:31:59.713 --> 01:32:05.018
I am literally going to
tear you apart and eat you.

01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:09.389
Keep in mind, it's not because I want to.

01:32:11.256 --> 01:32:14.327
I don't know why...

01:32:14.361 --> 01:32:16.729
but I have to.

01:32:16.763 --> 01:32:19.633
It's the way it's always been... always.

01:32:21.768 --> 01:32:24.939
It keeps my mind straight.

01:32:27.374 --> 01:32:30.677
But how sane can you be in the first
place, if you have to fucking eat people?

01:32:30.710 --> 01:32:33.447
I don't know.

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:44.991
What? Why?

01:32:45.025 --> 01:32:48.995
Why now? For him?

01:32:49.028 --> 01:32:51.697
That man's a murderer and he's aware of it!

01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:55.001
The world would be a better
place if I killed him, right now.

01:32:55.035 --> 01:32:57.204
I've tortured thousands of
innocent people to death...

01:32:57.237 --> 01:32:59.106
and you weren't around for them!

01:32:59.138 --> 01:33:01.775
You weren't even around
for Egypt. Or Walachilla!

01:33:01.808 --> 01:33:05.679
I impaled thousands of people
in Walachilla just see them die.

01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:10.217
Look at me. Look at me!

01:33:13.053 --> 01:33:15.287
Fuck you! I hate you!

01:33:15.321 --> 01:33:18.725
I hate this fucking place, all of it!

01:33:18.758 --> 01:33:20.394
Who are you talking to?

01:33:20.427 --> 01:33:22.262
You can't see him?

01:33:24.097 --> 01:33:26.032
Now I have your attention?

01:33:26.066 --> 01:33:28.068
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:33:28.101 --> 01:33:30.036
Why are you doing this to me?

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:32.773
Is it because of that
prick Habal? Fuck you!

01:33:32.805 --> 01:33:35.375
Why is that murder so fucking significant?

01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:37.343
We were barely men back then?

01:33:37.376 --> 01:33:38.812
Did I really start it?

01:33:38.844 --> 01:33:41.680
Would murder not exist, if I
didn't kill that little shit?

01:33:41.714 --> 01:33:43.483
No one else goes through this.

01:33:43.515 --> 01:33:46.385
I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this!

01:33:46.419 --> 01:33:48.455
Fuck god, because there isn't one!

01:33:48.487 --> 01:33:52.325
If there was, she wouldn't let this happen!

01:33:52.357 --> 01:33:54.360
All I see is you walking around.

01:33:54.393 --> 01:33:57.798
Let me fucking die. Let me die!

01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:59.198
Jack!

01:33:59.232 --> 01:34:01.368
- Jack, we need help.
- What?

01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:03.702
Please, God, help me.

01:34:03.736 --> 01:34:09.108
Uh... um, I can't... I can't
get Andrea to the car...

01:34:09.142 --> 01:34:12.845
and I am doing more damage trying
to get her there so, I need help.

01:34:12.879 --> 01:34:14.848
- But...
- But what?

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.150
What could you possibly be
doing that is more important?

01:34:17.183 --> 01:34:18.818
Uh...

01:34:18.852 --> 01:34:22.488
Stop fooling around with that asshole, Jack,
and get out there and help your daughter.

01:34:22.522 --> 01:34:24.457
She's your family, for God sake.

01:34:24.491 --> 01:34:26.860
I don't even know what
there is to think about.

01:34:29.829 --> 01:34:32.198
Please go.

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.168
Nothing, I guess.

01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:36.336
So get out there.

01:34:36.369 --> 01:34:37.838
All right.

01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:49.883
Agh... Jack...

01:34:49.915 --> 01:34:53.253
One day, you'll see who I was talking to.

01:35:16.843 --> 01:35:19.546
Hi.
