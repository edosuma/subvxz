01:46.973 --> 01:48.634
And now, the news.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.786
You wanna take it for a test drive?

02:52.739 --> 02:56.300
Last week we talked
about you feeling like the sad clown.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.545
What's going on now?

03:13.393 --> 03:15.486
Well, I had a dream the other night...

03:20.133 --> 03:23.591
I was riding in a Cadillac,
like my father used to have.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.338
Carmela was driving,
and I was in the back passenger seat.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.500
Sitting next to me was Gloria.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.875
In front of me, sitting next to Carmela,
was a business associate of mine.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.110
He's the one whose son had the accident.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.414
I don't know where we were going. No place.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.915
'Cause we never seemed to get anywhere.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.253
Kinda like this therapy.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.931
And it was hot in the car, it was stuffy.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.328
There was no air-conditioning.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.907
That's all of it.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.410
Oh, and...

04:08.648 --> 04:11.276
my friend had a caterpillar on his head.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.546
It turned into a butterfly.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.483
Has your friend recently changed?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.692
Not a friend. Associate.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.289
And no.
- What do you think the dream means?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.763
Can't you tell me
what the fucking thing means?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.631
I mean, you obviously know.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.863
Why do we have to go through
this exercise every time?

04:33.339 --> 04:36.797
I don't obviously know.
I didn't have the dream.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.772
The meaning is elicited
through verbalization.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.313
And the gehoxtahagen is framed
up by the ramistan.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.650
Okay. Your wife...

04:53.393 --> 04:56.692
your mistress, a business associate, you...

04:57.196 --> 04:58.663
all in the same car.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.898
Your father's car.
- With my wife driving...

05:01.968 --> 05:03.936
which, if my father were alive...

05:04.203 --> 05:06.569
he wouldn't have stood
for two fucking seconds.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.765
I hear anger.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.003
No, I'm just saying,
the old guys were different.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.738
Men in the front, wives in the back.
- You like that arrangement?

05:15.848 --> 05:19.545
Actually, I think the wife
should ride in a little cart behind the car.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.516
Like in the cartoons.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.723
Like behind Noah's Ark,
there's a little boat with the skunks.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.156
So wives are skunks?

05:26.225 --> 05:28.716
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, it's a fucking joke.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.093
Does it have to be
like a cancer hospital in here?

05:31.164 --> 05:34.827
But Carmela is in control in the dream.
- Why? 'Cause she's driving?

05:34.901 --> 05:39.395
Whatever's gone on with the other two,
you want to square it with Carmela.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.065
Why?
- That's what we need to find out.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.606
Freud says dreams are wishes.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.473
Dreams are wishes?

05:48.247 --> 05:52.547
I thought you said that dreams
represent repressed urges and-

05:52.618 --> 05:55.587
It depends.
- I oughta quit this fucking therapy.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.419
'Maybe it's this, maybe it's that. '
Maybe it's a fungule!

05:59.425 --> 06:03.156
What about impulse control?
I been sitting in this chair for four years...

06:03.229 --> 06:04.753
and nothing's been done about that!

06:04.831 --> 06:06.958
And it leads me to make mistakes
at my work!

06:07.033 --> 06:08.864
What good did you do me with that?

06:12.438 --> 06:16.033
Let's get back to the dream.
- Oh, fuck the dream, it's just a dream.

06:16.175 --> 06:19.338
Jesus Christ, the money I spend here,
I could've bought a Ferrari.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.903
At least I would've got a blowjob out of that!

06:21.981 --> 06:24.006
What do you mean?
- Please.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.579
Don't get me started.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.815
I think you're glossing over the significant
accomplishments we've made in here.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.585
'My mother would come
when she looked at a pot roast. '

06:32.658 --> 06:35.354
'Oh, you're second in the birthing order. '

06:35.428 --> 06:38.886
'Oh, Carmela's driving the car,
how fucking interesting. '

06:44.003 --> 06:47.097
When you first came here,
you were clinically depressed.

06:47.173 --> 06:50.973
You suffered from panic attacks
that put your life in danger.

06:52.044 --> 06:55.343
There's been significant relief
in both those areas.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.105
You're right, but...

06:57.984 --> 06:59.144
I mean, come on.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.676
I've been coming here four years now.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.987
I've been a good sport.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.424
Sophia! Your jacket.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.231
You're just getting over a cold, come on.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.490
I miss you so much.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.166
I'd be with you right now
if it wasn't for the kids.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.209
We want a 40-percent position
in your HUD business.

07:59.278 --> 08:03.271
'Cause I bent on the other thing, you're
entitled to reach into my pocket on this?

08:03.349 --> 08:05.112
That was a gesture of goodwill.

08:06.185 --> 08:09.382
We've been down this road before.
We share Zellman.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.681
Therefore, any of the fruits of Zellman,
we're entitled to.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.488
We done here?
- Fucking Ralph.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.887
Where's your point man on this thing?

08:18.965 --> 08:23.129
He missed his drops this week.
- I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.640
About what we expected.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.783
Blooming Onion. Cool.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.187
The steak with the toothpick is Daddy's,
he likes it still mooing.

08:47.226 --> 08:50.593
I saw on CNBC
that Outback's profitability is-

08:50.663 --> 08:51.687
Excuse me.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.059
Dad?
- Wait, sit.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.831
Sit and eat. It's a sin to waste good food.

08:57.904 --> 09:01.670
Try the mushrooms. I don't know what
they do to them, but they're delicious.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.481
I'm all right.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.551
The kids are fed.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.547
Thank you.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.960
What did you do with the cake today?
- Cake?

09:22.028 --> 09:24.519
Your daughter saw it in the back of your car.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.395
She told me about it
when I picked her up from practice.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.831
I took it to Karen's grave.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.775
I buried it.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.279
Today was our anniversary.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.817
Fourteen years.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.623
I wish you would've told me about it
before I picked up the steaks from Outback.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.385
The sides alone were over $30.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.467
How often do you go to the grave?

10:04.737 --> 10:08.639
Every day. That's what I miss the most,
talking to her.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.381
Believe me, Bobby, I know.
I lost both my parents.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.651
It's very easy for people
to give facile advice:

10:20.720 --> 10:23.553
'Suck it up, move on,' etc.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.852
I'm not gonna tell you that.
Grieving is a process.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.157
Sometimes courage isn't a value.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.561
Tony.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.729
Hello?
- Look...

10:40.806 --> 10:42.535
let's not let this get out of hand.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.701
We've been doing good business
for a while now.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.768
Carmine agrees. I agree.

10:47.013 --> 10:50.176
Forty percent is not gonna happen.
We all know it.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.949
I'm willing to go five and a half.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.590
Hello?
- Not acceptable.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.597
This guy who does
the housing appraisals for Tony-

11:07.667 --> 11:09.567
'Vic the Appraiser,' they call him.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.308
I want you to pay a visit
to this Polack Tony Soprano's...

11:19.378 --> 11:21.778
got doing phony house appraisals.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.041
Vic the Appraiser.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.048
Make this guy understand
that he's gonna be working for us...

11:26.118 --> 11:28.348
on these shithole houses
we bought in Jersey.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.479
You got it.

11:38.831 --> 11:41.322
Why did he get her a cake? She died.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.560
Go back to bed.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.498
Nicky Ghilardi said mommy's ghost
is gonna come back and haunt us.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.002
There's no such things as ghosts.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.470
The cake?

11:57.983 --> 11:59.450
Maybe it was for the nuns.

11:59.985 --> 12:03.978
Sometimes, when I'm walking down
the hallway, I can smell her hair.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.527
Well, maybe if we did something bad,
she'd haunt us for our own good.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.135
There's nothing to be scared of.
Go back to bed.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.046
Tony's pretty hot...

12:31.250 --> 12:32.842
that you didn't counteroffer.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.943
God forbid, if this gets really bad...

12:36.822 --> 12:38.380
there could be a change.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.984
Tony?

12:42.061 --> 12:45.861
Suffice to say, no matter what happens now,
or in the future...

12:46.599 --> 12:48.590
Carmine won't forget you.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.864
And as far as us talking like this...

12:53.706 --> 12:55.606
It's just because we're old friends.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.403
And I know I can blow off
a little steam with you.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.079
Cheaper than a bartender.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.412
I'm only trying to bring
good relations between the families...

13:04.550 --> 13:06.882
as I always do and always will.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.919
No matter what happens or who's in charge.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.920
If it's me, God forbid...

13:12.825 --> 13:13.883
or whoever.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.758
Hey, Branca. How you doing?
- Hello.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.728
Is he around?
- Shaving.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.975
How's your boss?
- Shaving his face.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.206
No, your employer there, Miss Kirilenko?

13:35.581 --> 13:36.673
Fine.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.915
Reason I'm asking is
'cause we didn't get the bill.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.519
Here he is.
- I've fucking had it.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.160
With what?
- Everything.

13:53.499 --> 13:57.026
Did you offer my nephew something?
- I'm a registered nurse.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.464
Not maid.
- Did you offer him an aspirin?

14:05.444 --> 14:06.433
Cunt.

14:10.249 --> 14:11.477
What's with you?

14:13.052 --> 14:15.384
This fucking competency hearing.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.622
Delayed twice,
and now it's coming up on Friday.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.660
I don't know whether to chill the champagne
or shit in my pants.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.388
It's gonna be...

14:23.462 --> 14:25.692
You got shaving cream all over you.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.926
Don't you wash yourself off?

14:31.103 --> 14:34.800
It's over here, too.
- Yeah, it's that fucking lighting upstairs.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.898
If Bobby put in the right wattage...

14:41.780 --> 14:42.804
All right, listen.

14:42.882 --> 14:47.046
We found out where the jurors meet every
day before they're bused to the courthouse.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.451
Now if this mental competency thing
don't work-

14:49.521 --> 14:51.011
I don't wanna talk about it.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.159
So, what is the story there with you two?

14:59.498 --> 15:03.093
He's a great guy.
He's just still very much in mourning.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.198
We're stuck at platonic.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.962
Well, Karen was a wonderful person.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.199
I'm sure God must have his reasons...

15:10.276 --> 15:12.369
but sometimes you have to wonder.

15:12.611 --> 15:16.411
Well, I'm sure she was as good as gold,
but he's developing a psychosis.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.716
Her clothes are still in the closet.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.753
And yesterday he bought her a cake
for their anniversary...

15:21.820 --> 15:23.515
and he buried it at her grave.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.557
What? At her grave?

15:25.624 --> 15:29.583
God forbid that I should say something,
because I would be perceived as a harpy...

15:29.662 --> 15:33.120
coming between
him and his dead, idealized wife.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.435
Listen, you,
don't make any plans for Sunday.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.728
The Baccilieris are coming over.
Make those kids feel welcome.

15:40.806 --> 15:44.742
Bobby Junior? The kid's like 11.
- I don't ask you to do chore one!

15:44.810 --> 15:47.836
You can go without seeing Devin
and your friends for one night.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.439
Yeah, we were supposed to study.
But I guess you don't care about that.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.184
Vic!

16:04.964 --> 16:07.091
You don't return Johnny's phone calls?

16:07.266 --> 16:08.790
What did you say?

16:10.369 --> 16:11.859
I'm only the appraiser!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.345
Now, let me appraise you of this.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.251
Be at the Red Chimney on Route 3,
9:00 tomorrow morning...

16:29.321 --> 16:31.551
ready to go to work
for Johnny and Carmine.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.526
Victor's scared now.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.333
Nobody knows where he is.
- Look, it's a bluff.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.734
They don't wanna start a separate operation.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.204
You know the costs that are involved
in a HUD scam?

16:48.273 --> 16:50.798
You got the appraiser, the poverty pimp.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.741
They want in on a going thing.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.336
You want me to pay a visit
to Johnny Sack's guys?

16:55.414 --> 16:56.711
Just say the word.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.109
You know what?

17:00.352 --> 17:03.321
I'm not gonna go fucking ballistic.
- All due respect, T.

17:03.455 --> 17:07.050
Throwing your appraiser a beating
was a provocation to you directly.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.294
There he is.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.459
You tell him to stop beeping that horn,
or I'm gonna shove it up his fucking ass!

17:18.270 --> 17:20.032
All right, Sil.
- Enjoy the game.

17:20.472 --> 17:23.031
I'll see you, Tony.
- All right, Vit'.

17:26.578 --> 17:29.069
You ever talk to Beansie
down there in Florida?

17:29.515 --> 17:30.573
Now and then.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.846
Does he ever run
into Carmine's son down in Miami?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.714
I'll be on my cell if you need me.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.794
Beansie tells me...

17:44.663 --> 17:48.759
he sees Little Carmine all the time.
- Well, maybe Beansie can feel him out.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.600
See if he's receptive to a meet with me.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.371
Maybe we can work this shit out,
if he talks to his old man.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.141
Beansie's gotta happen to run into him.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.012
Not like we're asking.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.810
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.615
Look at that.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.281
Just stuffed artichokes.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.355
No cactus for me.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.554
You're not Italian if you don't like artichoke.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.995
So what, Mike Piazza
eats nothing but artichokes?

18:23.535 --> 18:25.059
I mean, that's dicked up.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.136
All right.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.104
I like rice. Maybe I'm Chinese.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.372
A.J.
- You, too, Bobby.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.214
How'd you like it if Oriental kids
were making fun of you?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.310
I'll get it.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.685
You want an artichoke, Bobby Junior?
- No.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.257
It's dinnertime.
- You sure, B.J.?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.520
You're really missing out.
- I said already.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.967
Hi, Mrs. Soprano.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.737
Everybody, this is Devin.

19:02.741 --> 19:06.700
Would you like something to eat?
- No, thank you, I'll just wait inside.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.813
She tell you who I saw
at Schantz's Hardware last week?

19:13.886 --> 19:17.117
Oh, God, do you have to tell
every person you run into?

19:17.189 --> 19:20.750
I'll put an end to the mystery right now.
Connie Francis.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.024
Excuse me.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.728
She was looking at recessed lighting.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.493
I put in recessed lighting. But I'm sorry now.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.501
Hello?
- Tony, it's me.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.899
Hey, how you doing?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.302
Fine fettle. Listen, I spoke to our friend.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.031
The son. He seemed very receptive.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.698
Tuesday night.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.340
We'll meet down here in Florida.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.771
We'll pick a place later.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.147
I got my stepdaughter
and her friends this weekend.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.879
I'm gonna have to bring them along.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.513
Okay, good. Thanks.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.388
Somebody will call you.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.455
Where is Anthony?

19:56.728 --> 19:58.457
He went upstairs with that girl.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.562
You two come with me.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.634
That door is not supposed to be closed.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.401
We were studying.

20:13.478 --> 20:15.810
Is this how you treat your guests?
- My guests?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.542
You invited them.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.944
These kids just lost their mom.
Could you give them a little time?

20:22.020 --> 20:25.251
You know how much Little Bobby likes you.
- Now what am I, daycare?

20:25.924 --> 20:27.892
You must have a million games in here.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.929
Clue, Monopoly.
Help them pick something out.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.726
Come on in, kids.
A.J.'s gonna help you find a game.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.172
Spirit...

20:46.411 --> 20:47.844
speak to me.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.242
Is Bobby Junior gay?

20:53.552 --> 20:56.885
Now, do it again for reaI,
like last time with the dead little baby.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.479
Quit messing around.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.123
Okay, serious.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.921
Spirits, identify yourself.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.554
You're forcing it again.
- Shut up!

21:09.034 --> 21:10.729
Do you think it's my mom?

21:10.802 --> 21:13.293
Probably not. It's not people you know.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.463
Will you do it with me, Devin?
- Okay.

21:21.046 --> 21:23.947
Spirit. Do you know Karen Baccilieri?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.854
Is she making new friends in heaven?

21:35.560 --> 21:39.223
Maybe we should play something else.
- This is stupid. Let's play Clue.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.095
You're just a scared little baby.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.964
I'm not scared. I have this game at home.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.865
I used to play it all the time...

21:46.672 --> 21:47.969
until it got boring.

21:48.373 --> 21:52.571
How about we try
and contact the dead for real?

21:53.211 --> 21:54.803
Just heard from our friend.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.246
The other guy'll sit down.
I'm going on Tuesday.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.841
Want me there?
- I was thinking of bringing Paulie down.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.148
Face time with you could be what he needs.

22:02.387 --> 22:05.254
He's on the rag lately.
- Then I decided against it.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.384
The other day,
we were talking about Florida.

22:09.194 --> 22:12.561
I noticed you clammed up around Paulie.
- You did, too.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.892
It occurred to me
that maybe Paulie's the one...

22:15.967 --> 22:18.265
telling our friend in New York
all our business.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.034
Somebody had to pass along that fat joke.
- He was in Youngstown at the time.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.837
In the can.
- What, people can't visit him?

22:25.377 --> 22:27.004
Jesus, you believe this shit?

22:28.146 --> 22:30.011
We're talking about fucking Paulie here.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.573
For now, he's got no reason
to know about the trip.

22:32.651 --> 22:35.176
Nobody's got a reason to know.
- Absolutely.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.854
It's on a need-to-know basis.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.386
And get this fucking appraiser
working again.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.154
I got houses just sitting there.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.955
You got to hold hands.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.191
And nobody let go.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.735
The most important thing...

22:53.472 --> 22:56.202
is that you keep your eyes closed
during the ceremony...

22:56.274 --> 22:59.300
because if you open them,
whatever spirits we're speaking to...

22:59.378 --> 23:02.438
will permanently remain trapped
between worlds forever.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.312
Everybody's eyes shut?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.420
Oh, great spirit from beyond.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.262
Reveal yourself.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.822
Give us a sign of your presence.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.130
Keep laughing if you think it's funny.
- It was you.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.836
You hear that?
- What?

23:31.076 --> 23:32.839
I heard it.
- Me, too.

23:33.011 --> 23:34.137
Wait.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.706
I see a...

23:36.748 --> 23:38.010
gray mist...

23:38.784 --> 23:42.242
with little specks of light.
- That's what I'm seeing, too.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.309
Wait.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.856
I see somebody. An old man.

23:47.359 --> 23:51.455
Spirit from another dimension,
can you reveal yourself?

23:53.365 --> 23:54.457
What?

23:55.667 --> 23:58.534
What's that?
- How come he's only talking to you?

23:58.837 --> 24:02.136
Because I'm the oldest,
and closest to the afterlife.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.140
You're a sea captain?

24:08.146 --> 24:10.740
Captain Jacobus? What?

24:11.683 --> 24:15.915
He says it's a terrible storm.
It's raining where you are?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.680
Waves are smashing against the boat?

24:22.961 --> 24:24.519
He's here!

24:24.596 --> 24:27.030
Oh, Jesus Christ, they'll kill me.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.367
What's going on?

24:30.569 --> 24:32.332
Oh, my God, what happened?

24:32.838 --> 24:34.772
Nothing, we were just playing.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.241
We were playing Ouija board.
And then A.J. did this séance.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.141
Dad, I want to go home.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.541
Soph', it's just a Ouija board.

24:47.786 --> 24:48.980
She's just scared.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.783
It's okay, honey, Daddy's here.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.155
This is your idea of fun?
You scared these kids half to death!

24:54.226 --> 24:55.955
I didn't do anything. He freaked out.

24:56.027 --> 24:59.861
Why's your shirt all wet?
- Bobby, look, he had a sponge.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.558
After what we just talked about,
this is what you do?

25:02.634 --> 25:04.898
You asshole.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.772
You, say good night.
You, get out of my sight.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.171
I can't remember
when I was more disappointed in you.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.713
Good night.
- You know what?

25:15.780 --> 25:18.874
He locked me in the garage
at the guy with the ponytaiI's house.

25:18.950 --> 25:22.511
Bobby, I don't even know what to say.
I am so embarrassed.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.179
Part of growing up, don't worry about it.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.299
I'm only the appraiser!

25:42.107 --> 25:44.098
What do you think?
You could hide from us?

25:44.175 --> 25:46.575
Tony bought three more houses
that need appraisals.

25:46.645 --> 25:50.411
I can't. I told you, please.
Johnny and Carmine's guys, they hurt me.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.146
That's nothing
compared to what we're gonna do, Victor.

25:55.220 --> 25:59.020
So go back inside, get your appraising shit,
and start appraising.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.225
Did you like the movie?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.334
What's the matter?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.262
You went to the cemetery today, didn't you?

26:15.674 --> 26:17.266
How do you know?

26:17.809 --> 26:20.175
'Cause you got cemetery mud
on your shoes.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.941
Mud? What are you,
Marge Hingenbrender now?

26:23.014 --> 26:26.177
What do you know about the mud?
You been spying on me?

26:27.018 --> 26:30.385
What, I can't go to the cemetery?
I got to get permission from you?

26:30.455 --> 26:32.582
We're talking about you. Not me.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.987
You know, the grave and the funeral...

26:36.161 --> 26:38.561
It's never ending.
You don't want to let it go.

26:38.630 --> 26:42.157
Did you even pay the funeral bill yet?
- I'm never gonna pay him.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.999
Son of a bitch put an extra 15 pounds
on Karen when they did her up.

26:46.071 --> 26:49.438
This dispute with the bill is morbid clinging.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.067
This is exactly what I mean,
we have a nice evening...

26:53.144 --> 26:55.112
and we end up talking about your dead wife.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.478
You invited me.
- The other night at Tony's...

26:57.549 --> 27:00.780
your kids were trying to contact Karen
on a Ouija board.

27:00.852 --> 27:03.218
What do you expect?
You're talking to a headstone.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.746
She's my wife.
- She's dead, and I'm here.

27:06.825 --> 27:09.293
Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

27:37.722 --> 27:39.212
Tony, it's Svetlana.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.452
I've just received the brooch.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.555
I want to thank you.

27:45.630 --> 27:49.396
I don't know why I deserve it, but-
- No, I don't want to hear that.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.059
I want you to keep it.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.729
I'm gonna keep it, don't worry.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.166
Diamonds like this...

27:58.043 --> 28:00.841
It's a very nice gift. Very sweet.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.877
And what happened between us...

28:05.150 --> 28:06.549
it was nice, too.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.051
Okay, well...

28:09.454 --> 28:10.853
That's it, then?

28:11.122 --> 28:13.488
These things happen, and then life goes on.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.549
Are you sure? Because...

28:15.660 --> 28:18.220
if you ever want to talk,
or you ever need anything-

28:18.296 --> 28:19.490
No, it's all right.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.589
Thank you for the brooch.

28:29.174 --> 28:32.473
Broke a woman's heart.
Told her I couldn't see her no more.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.375
Sad, but there was no getting around it.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.607
Who is she?
- Takes care of my uncle.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.379
Runs an elder care agency.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.347
She took care of my mother, too.

28:42.420 --> 28:46.516
Your former girlfriend's cousin?
- That one, yeah.

28:46.991 --> 28:50.927
Is she your current cumare?
- No, some brief fling kind of thing.

28:52.263 --> 28:55.858
You know, after a while,
I felt like I had to cut off her leg.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.526
Not leg, affair.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.927
Did I say leg?
- Why did you cut it off?

29:01.206 --> 29:03.003
Jesus, I am married.

29:03.274 --> 29:05.765
What happened?
- I bought her the...

29:05.944 --> 29:10.643
It's this diamond pin
that I send to every woman when I'm...

29:11.616 --> 29:14.312
easing out the door,
I'm such a fucking prick.

29:16.554 --> 29:17.987
You know what?

29:18.623 --> 29:20.318
This is all bullshit.

29:21.526 --> 29:24.324
It was she who gave me my walking papers.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.521
You believe that?
- What I meant was that-

29:26.598 --> 29:28.828
You know why
she didn't want to see me anymore?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.663
She said that I was high maintenance.

29:30.735 --> 29:34.501
And this is after all the time and
all the money and all the fucking Prozac...

29:34.572 --> 29:38.064
and all the fucking cocksucking,
motherfucking dream interpretations.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.077
And she says she didn't want to prop me up.

29:40.145 --> 29:43.740
And this from a broad
that walks around on crutches half the time.

29:44.315 --> 29:45.407
Nice?

29:45.984 --> 29:48.509
Do you agree
with her characterization of you?

29:48.586 --> 29:51.749
I'm a miserable prick.
I've said this since day one.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.654
And you're no longer interested
in changing?

29:54.726 --> 29:56.250
In finding a way out?

30:03.835 --> 30:05.427
No, I guess not.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.671
I said this last time.
You just didn't want to hear it.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.043
You're paying me for my honest opinion.

30:16.114 --> 30:17.911
You should be in therapy.

30:18.349 --> 30:22.115
All this fucking self-knowledge,
what the fuck has it gotten me?

30:22.187 --> 30:25.020
Okay, maybe it got me some shit
in the beginning.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.852
Some leadership strategies.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.950
All we do now is sit around half the time...

30:29.027 --> 30:33.020
shooting the breeze about philosophy,
the Italians, my uncle Eckley.

30:33.097 --> 30:34.997
I try to keep the focus on the work.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.695
So when it goes off, it's my fault?
Okay, fine, I accept that.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.067
You know what she says?

30:43.608 --> 30:44.836
This broad...

30:46.044 --> 30:48.308
she's from Russia, dirt poor.

30:49.547 --> 30:53.677
She had some kind of osocarma disease
in her leg when she was nine.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.883
She says that nowhere else in the world
do people expect to be happy...

30:58.957 --> 31:01.949
except for here in this country,
and still we're not.

31:02.126 --> 31:03.320
And we got everything.

31:03.394 --> 31:06.124
And when we're not, what do we do?
We go to shrinks.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.188
For what, $6 or $7 a minute?

31:08.499 --> 31:10.763
There's some truth to what she says.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.065
But should that be a source of shame?

31:13.137 --> 31:17.403
That when the desperate struggle
for food and shelter is finally behind us...

31:17.809 --> 31:19.367
we can turn our attention...

31:19.777 --> 31:22.871
to other sources of pain and truth?

31:23.147 --> 31:24.409
'Pain and truth. '

31:24.482 --> 31:27.474
Come on,
I'm a fat fucking crook from New Jersey.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.256
Now that the panic attacks
and the baseline depression...

31:32.323 --> 31:35.349
have been dealt with,
the real work can begin.

31:35.426 --> 31:38.691
I knew you'd say something like that.
- Because it's true.

31:38.763 --> 31:42.062
When we're not constantly
having to put out fires...

31:42.400 --> 31:45.062
we can really delve into who you are...

31:45.136 --> 31:49.732
and what you're really after
in your very brief time on this earth.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.872
I'm sorry.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.307
I don't want to do this anymore.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.685
And you can say that I'm running away.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.085
But I've been here
longer than I thought I'd stay.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.680
Longer than anybody ever thought I'd stay.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.586
And you know what?
I get no appreciation for it.

32:10.895 --> 32:12.886
You've shown a lot of courage.

32:13.531 --> 32:14.998
I commend you on that.

32:15.066 --> 32:19.298
Thank you for the commendation and adiós.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.576
Look, no fault, no foul.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.739
I appreciate everything you've done for me.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.476
Come to your next appointment.
One more time.

32:32.984 --> 32:36.613
You'll cover my $300-a-week in no time
with some other mortadella.

32:37.255 --> 32:39.883
All right, I shouldn't have said that.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.559
Look, you saved my life in the beginning...

32:44.062 --> 32:47.554
and for all the times
I came on like an asshole, I'm very sorry.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.033
You've got my number
if you change your mind.

32:55.506 --> 32:59.408
And if you begin to feeI
any of the old feelings, you need to call me.

33:02.447 --> 33:06.008
So, what's customary?
I mean, do we shake hands?

33:08.419 --> 33:10.319
How about a diamond pin?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.491
Okay, well...

33:26.337 --> 33:27.531
Goodbye.

33:41.652 --> 33:43.711
You've reached Doctor Elliot Kupferberg.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.154
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.714
If this is an emergency...

33:47.792 --> 33:52.525
you can reach me at 973-555-7089.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.167
Guess who's no longer a patient of mine.

34:01.139 --> 34:02.629
Calling all cars.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.540
His user name had 666.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.840
That means Satan.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.035
I was gonna park in that spot.

35:44.108 --> 35:46.872
Ball breaker, welcome to Miami.

35:49.580 --> 35:53.311
Mr. Melvoin, I've read your application
for dismissal...

35:53.384 --> 35:55.375
on the grounds of mental incompetence.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.479
And I've reviewed
the findings of the doctors in this matter.

35:58.556 --> 36:03.220
Frankly, they were unmoved
by Mr. Soprano's performance.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.763
Your Honor, to couch it as a performance-

36:06.831 --> 36:09.356
It's their opinion
that he understands the charges...

36:09.433 --> 36:12.698
and that he's more than competent
to participate in his own defense.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.761
I'd like another round of testing.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.397
Your Honor...

36:17.408 --> 36:20.206
I didn't come all this way
to stop this trial now.

36:20.611 --> 36:24.047
Court will convene on Monday at 9:30
to continue proceedings.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.309
Your Honor, please.

36:25.383 --> 36:29.649
Since his injury, I have not had
a single conversation with Mr. Soprano...

36:29.720 --> 36:32.348
in which we've related
on any meaningful level.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.118
Feel free to take that up on appeal.

36:42.633 --> 36:43.793
Fuck!

36:45.503 --> 36:47.937
We'll get to a juror. We're working very hard.

37:06.257 --> 37:07.417
Hello?

37:09.327 --> 37:11.158
Bobby, hi. What's up?

37:12.863 --> 37:14.990
I was just doing housework. Why?

37:16.701 --> 37:18.396
Is everything all right?

37:19.937 --> 37:21.165
Oh, my God.

37:28.879 --> 37:30.278
Tell me about it.

37:32.383 --> 37:35.352
Got home tonight. Kids were kind of quiet.

37:36.821 --> 37:39.187
Then bedtime, all hell broke loose.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.785
Crying, wouldn't be left alone.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.421
Sophia, especially.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.527
They've been playing
with that goddamn Ouija board again.

37:49.734 --> 37:52.601
Oh, no.
- They were trying to contact Karen.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.096
What?

38:01.746 --> 38:03.771
I don't know what to say, Bobby.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.315
I came over this afternoon
with some pound cake.

38:06.384 --> 38:07.408
I saw it.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.976
I heard them in his room
with that Ouija board.

38:10.054 --> 38:12.352
I thought, 'This is not good. '

38:13.391 --> 38:17.327
But then after the other night,
I didn't want to overstep my bounds.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.486
It's my fault.

38:21.899 --> 38:24.732
You're under a lot of stress.
You're a single dad.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.570
No, you were right. It's bad for them.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.669
It's unwholesome.
- You want me to go up?

38:32.943 --> 38:34.968
I think they're asleep. Finally.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.710
I had to read to Sophia for like an hour.

38:38.783 --> 38:42.184
She couldn't even handle a Nancy Drew,
it was too mysterious.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.514
Go ahead.
- It's just...

38:47.158 --> 38:49.683
The dead have nothing to say to us, Bobby.

38:50.761 --> 38:54.026
It's our own narcissism
that makes us think they even care.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.493
It does get better with time.

39:01.472 --> 39:04.930
Did you get anything to eat at least?
Can I fix you something?

39:05.543 --> 39:07.568
No, it's too much trouble.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.403
No, it's not. I'm starving, too.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.278
There's probably something in here.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.564
Karen's ziti?

39:30.468 --> 39:32.265
It's the last one she made.

39:43.247 --> 39:46.614
And it was like 300 degrees
in that Minnie Mouse head?

39:46.684 --> 39:49.482
So I took it off, you know?
I was gonna have a cigarette.

39:49.553 --> 39:52.681
And some kid took a picture of me.
- Come on, girls.

39:53.324 --> 39:56.418
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.529
Okay. Thanks.

39:59.597 --> 40:02.725
Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.227
Look, Carmine.

40:08.606 --> 40:11.905
You basically know what's going on
with your dad and Johnny...

40:11.976 --> 40:13.500
and us over in Jersey.

40:14.011 --> 40:16.502
First let me say, I understand.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.816
I appreciate the respect
you're showing me by coming here...

40:19.884 --> 40:21.784
and reaching out to me at this time.

40:21.852 --> 40:22.910
Always.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.716
I will also go on record as saying...

40:24.789 --> 40:26.882
I know my old man
can be a tough nut to crack.

40:26.957 --> 40:29.653
I don't want to crack nuts, but I will.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.086
I feel the anger.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.562
When I try, for the second time...

40:34.198 --> 40:37.861
on a separate issue entirely,
to reach an accommodation...

40:39.503 --> 40:42.267
and he don't even make a counteroffer,
where's his respect?

40:42.339 --> 40:45.001
I don't know what kind of advice
he's getting from Johnny.

40:45.075 --> 40:47.635
Johnny's always usually
a voice of moderation.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.736
Me and him, we get along good.

40:49.814 --> 40:53.181
So, all due respect,
let's not jump in and blame Johnny.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.979
True. John's a pragmatist.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.211
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.

40:59.323 --> 41:01.416
He lives above his head a little.

41:01.592 --> 41:05.688
I am reminded
of Louis the Whatever's finance minister:

41:06.096 --> 41:08.792
De-something. He built this chateau.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.333
Nicole and I saw it when we went to Paris.

41:11.402 --> 41:15.065
It even outshone Versailles,
where the king lived.

41:15.406 --> 41:18.375
In the end, Louis clapped him in irons.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.582
Look, Tony.

41:31.689 --> 41:34.715
AII I can promise you is, I will look into it.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.785
I understand you got to try to feel out
your old man so he don't give you 'a mazz'...

41:38.863 --> 41:40.831
you know, for sticking your nose in.

41:41.732 --> 41:45.190
I haven't been afraid of my father
for quite some time.

41:45.402 --> 41:46.801
Fair enough.

41:48.105 --> 41:51.563
But, Carmine, bear in mind,
he came onto my turf.

41:52.209 --> 41:54.541
He tried to recruit my mulignon.

41:54.778 --> 41:57.406
And worse, he roughed up my appraiser.

41:58.649 --> 42:02.847
If the proper response is not forthcoming
in a business-like time frame...

42:06.457 --> 42:09.051
my next move
will not be further conversation.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.150
I get it.

42:10.227 --> 42:12.923
You should know that my next call
will be to Johnny Sack...

42:12.997 --> 42:14.988
to let him know that we talked.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.329
He shouldn't feel blind-sided.

43:46.423 --> 43:47.583
Hello?

43:51.662 --> 43:53.653
I'm here for the masoner job.

44:11.415 --> 44:14.612
Me no speak the English.

44:16.086 --> 44:17.451
Mi dispiace.
