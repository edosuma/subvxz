00:12.471 --> 00:13.805
Something wrong?

00:14.139 --> 00:15.474
I have a bad feeling.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.808
<i>I always feel like that.</i>

00:16.934 --> 00:18.936
Like something horrible is about to happen.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.020
How do you live?

00:20.062 --> 00:23.315
I get used to it. Thing is,
when someone else also has that feeling,

00:23.357 --> 00:24.983
mine gets worse.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.277
You recognize this place?

00:27.611 --> 00:28.904
I don't remember.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.990
You must have visited many planets
when you were running from the Wraith.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.200
I didn't count.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.204
I don't know how you tell them apart.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.582
See? There you go.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.042
Nothing to worry about.

00:42.084 --> 00:46.630
Seems like a perfectly nice village to me,
just like dozens of others we've visited.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.551
It appears to be the type of encampment
my people trade with all the time.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.720
I see no evidence of threatening behavior or danger.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.974
I also see nothing we might
be interested in trading for.

01:02.855 --> 01:05.147
Hi. How you doing?

01:05.524 --> 01:06.650
Wraithbringer!

01:07.359 --> 01:09.653
<i>- Wraithbringer!</i>
<i>- Wraithbringer!</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:11.822
That can't be good.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.198
You don't have to be afraid!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.784
- Where are they going?
- We need to get out of here now.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.162
I take it he was talking to you?

01:21.707 --> 01:23.375
That did not just happen!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.710
Warning fire only!

01:27.921 --> 01:28.714
Go!

01:31.717 --> 01:34.595
- Oh, my God, it hurts! I can't feel my leg!
- Pain or numbness?

01:34.636 --> 01:35.429
Both!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.476
<i>What the hell did you do to these people?</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:42.477
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:44.897
How could he not recognize the Gate address?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.858
Do you know the symbols of every address
of every planet we've been to?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.359
Yes, as a matter of fact!

01:50.736 --> 01:52.446
Go! Get to the Gate!

02:05.209 --> 02:07.044
Go on! We'll be right behind you.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.195
Oh, damn it!

02:49.253 --> 02:50.879
Oh, crap.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.101
Rodney!

03:04.393 --> 03:06.061
Medical team to the Gate room!

03:07.896 --> 03:08.856
Rodney?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.732
Hey, where are the others?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.359
They're right behind me.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.857
<i>Well...</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.736
I guess it could be worse.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.322
<i>Look...</i>

04:40.572 --> 04:43.116
I know you must be thinking this is your fault...

04:45.869 --> 04:48.288
I have already tried to console him.

04:51.917 --> 04:56.255
We were bound to run across a planet
you'd been to sooner or later.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.928
It was night last time.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.191
Linor!

05:16.733 --> 05:17.651
Stay away.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.111
<i>It's a man, father.</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:20.863
He's near death.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.448
You think we would not remember you?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.369
We offered you food and shelter.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.260
Thank you.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.722
Maybe you did not remember our village.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.850
We were forced to rebuild after the Wraith came.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.908
Linor! No!

06:10.412 --> 06:12.873
They were not merely culling us
as they had in the past.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.583
They were looking for you.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.337
- I'm sorry...
- Sorry?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.714
<i>I doubt that.</i>

06:21.215 --> 06:24.885
You will not bring death and destruction on us again.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.094
Look...

06:26.595 --> 06:28.722
I can't say the Wraith won't be back here again,

06:28.764 --> 06:31.683
but I can promise you they're not
coming back here because of him.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.809
No.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.563
Not once we've sacrificed the
Wraithbringer to his masters.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.065
He prefers "Ronon".

06:38.398 --> 06:41.193
Probably also prefers not to be
sacrificed to the Wraith.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.529
He is a victim of the Wraith,

06:43.612 --> 06:44.780
<i>like all of us.</i>

06:44.821 --> 06:49.159
<i>His planet was destroyed. He was captured and</i>
<i>made a runner, but he is not one anymore.</i>

06:49.201 --> 06:51.578
They cannot track him as they once did.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.039
They did not feed on us all last time.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.209
<i>They promised that if he ever came back,</i>
<i>and we captured him,</i>

06:57.584 --> 07:00.045
<i>we would be forever free from culling in the future.</i>

07:00.879 --> 07:02.631
They "promised"?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.509
They are Wraith!

07:05.968 --> 07:08.679
I promise you that killing Ronon will not
change what happened.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.139
<i>And it will not protect you in the future.</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:12.933
I said nothing of killing.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.352
Isn't that what "sacrifice" means?

07:15.644 --> 07:19.398
I know not what his masters will do
to him once we turn him over.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.567
You're giving him to the Wraith?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.277
They left this behind...

07:23.360 --> 07:25.487
So that we could call them.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.823
He has already activated it.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.741
They're going to kill all of us...

07:29.783 --> 07:31.285
you included.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.172
So many colors...

07:43.547 --> 07:46.049
all the pretty horses.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.759
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

07:48.051 --> 07:50.345
I gave him some morphine for the pain.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.765
I need to know how many villagers.

07:53.849 --> 07:57.102
How far is the Gate from the village?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.272
Have you seen a guy around?

08:00.314 --> 08:03.859
He looks like you, but he's got messy hair.

08:04.193 --> 08:10.115
I think I lost him somewhere,
and... and a pretty girl, and a caveman.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.286
I may have given him a wee bit too much,
but he was making it impossible for me to treat him.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.080
Snap out of it, McKay.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.373
It's important.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.710
Come on. What kind of weapons
did they have?

08:21.752 --> 08:24.087
I'd say something that shoots
arrows is a good guess.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.130
<i>Excuse me?</i>

08:25.339 --> 08:26.507
<i>Why am I lying here?</i>

08:26.798 --> 08:30.928
You have an arrow, Rodney, in your gluteus maximus.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.306
Well, that sounds painful.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.059
Gluteus maximus...

08:38.309 --> 08:39.852
<i>glootus...</i>

08:39.895 --> 08:41.647
<i>maa...ximus...</i>

08:42.606 --> 08:43.690
Oh, my God.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.442
That's my ass, isn't it?

08:45.484 --> 08:46.610
Aye.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.946
Call me if he makes any sense.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.156
Get him back here,

08:52.741 --> 08:54.284
the leader of your village.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.577
Why?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.121
Because I need to talk to him.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.582
It's too late for you.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.709
The Wraith will be here soon.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.924
Shoot me with one of those darts,

09:08.966 --> 09:11.802
and I promise he'll be dead before I go down.

09:11.844 --> 09:12.678
Let him go.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.472
Hey, buddy, you want to fill me in on this plan?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.225
- Let him go now.
- Get Keturah!

09:18.267 --> 09:19.560
I'm here.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.687
<i>Unhand him now!</i>

09:22.187 --> 09:24.398
I will not free you.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.317
<i>These men will kill your friends first.</i>

09:27.776 --> 09:30.279
I don't think that'll be necessary.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.573
Why don't we all put our weapons down and

09:32.614 --> 09:35.117
- talk about this nicely?
- Let them go.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.077
It's me the Wraith want.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.162
They had nothing to do with what happened here.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.289
<i>Ronon!</i>

09:42.332 --> 09:43.375
Don't.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.419
They won't shoot me.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.672
They must know the Wraith
still want me alive.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.758
I was a little more worried about
them shooting us.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.804
Please, Keturah.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.265
Let him go now!

10:02.811 --> 10:04.563
What the hell are you doing?

10:04.605 --> 10:05.814
Back off, Sheppard.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.317
Drop the knife now!

10:08.483 --> 10:09.610
No.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.946
<i>I didn't mean to bring the Wraith here,</i>

10:12.988 --> 10:15.449
- but it was my fault.
- That isn't true.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.909
You know it is.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.620
I should never have come here.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.331
I should never have stayed.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.419
I'm sorry about what happened to your village,

10:28.128 --> 10:31.089
<i>but if you think turning me over to</i>
<i>the Wraith will keep you safe,</i>

10:31.173 --> 10:32.132
fine.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.342
Do it.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.678
I'll do whatever I have to
to make up for what happened,

10:36.803 --> 10:39.181
but don't punish them for my mistake.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.354
They're good people.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.731
You let them go,

10:48.065 --> 10:52.110
or I'll be dead before the Wraith get here.
I promise.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.241
Then see what the Wraith do to you.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.203
<i>We're not leaving.</i>

11:01.286 --> 11:02.663
Not without you.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.706
You let them go.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.377
We have no issue with the other two.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.135
Let them go.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.474
<i>Resist and you will be killed.</i>

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
Incoming wormhole.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.792
It's Colonel Sheppard's IDC, Ma'am.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.377
Lower the shield.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.716
<i>Someone get us some vests and guns.</i>

11:55.757 --> 11:57.134
- Colonel, Teyla...
- Major.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.677
We were just about to come get you guys.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.804
- Where, where's Ronon?
- Still back there.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.139
McKay get through okay?

12:02.181 --> 12:04.016
Yeah, he's going to be fine.
What happened?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.392
<i>Ronon bargained for our freedom.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:08.103
By sticking a knife to his own throat.
We're going back.

12:08.145 --> 12:08.937
Dial the Gate.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.731
It took us 15 minutes to get to the Gate.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.900
The place could be crawling with Wraith by now.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.276
Let's go get him.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.444
We couldn't have been gone for more than a half-hour.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.987
It doesn't take long.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.618
<i>All right, everybody, fan out!</i>

13:16.964 --> 13:20.217
As we suspected, the deal did not go as planned.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.976
There's a few dozen bodies here at most.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.644
The rest were culled.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.979
We found these.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.485
We'll find him.

13:51.874 --> 13:56.253
I once fed from the humans of your homeworld.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.463
That is where I will watch you

13:58.505 --> 13:59.715
die.

14:19.151 --> 14:22.321
All right, boys, let's go!
Move, move, move!

15:21.421 --> 15:22.714
He's alive.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.259
Don't get me wrong. I hope he is.
But how can you be certain?

15:25.300 --> 15:27.427
They made sport out of trying to kill him in the past.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.846
He was the one that got away.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.347
I believe they will try again.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.975
Ronon will not go down easily.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.185
But they must know how dangerous he can be.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.813
It's not like they're going to give him a fair chance.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.023
Well, obviously, we don't have much time.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.817
How do we find him?

15:42.067 --> 15:45.070
If the Wraith placed a tracking device in him
the way they did last time...

15:45.112 --> 15:46.530
Can you pick up a signal?

15:47.406 --> 15:50.701
Oh, of course. If it sounds like
it might be impossible, you look at me.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.703
We still have the tracking device we took out of him.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.665
Might be able to tune the long-range sensors to pick up
any similarly generated transmissions.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.291
Good.

15:57.332 --> 16:01.003
But we are still assuming that the Wraith
actually put another one in him.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.963
I'll take whatever odds I can get.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.937
Ronon!

17:47.568 --> 17:48.402
McKay?

17:48.944 --> 17:50.070
<i>I'm here.</i>

17:51.947 --> 17:52.990
<i>You know...</i>

17:53.073 --> 17:56.743
you really don't appreciate the simple things in life.
Like...

17:56.785 --> 17:57.578
sitting.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.162
I don't envy you.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.248
It must be a real pain in the ass.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.875
How long did you work on that?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.294
Longer than I care to admit.
How's it coming?

18:05.335 --> 18:06.837
Well, I think I'm almost there.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.672
- Is this thing active?
<i>- Don't worry,</i>

18:08.714 --> 18:11.633
I limited the power so it won't transmit
our location to the Wraith.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.594
<i>I just needed enough juice to determine the...</i>

18:13.719 --> 18:15.888
<i>subspace frequency it broadcasts on,</i>

18:16.054 --> 18:16.972
and now...

18:17.139 --> 18:21.059
I need to re-calibrate the city's long-range sensors
to pick up on it.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.937
But these sensors only cover
a small corner of the galaxy.

18:23.979 --> 18:27.858
Unless they're calibrated to pick up
a signal being transmitted using subspace.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.987
How about I leave the bad jokes to you,
and you leave the brilliant science stuff to me?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.697
So, what are we looking at?

18:34.448 --> 18:39.119
These dots represent transmitters broadcasting
from various locations in the Pegasus galaxy.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.579
So there are...

18:40.871 --> 18:42.581
seven runners out there right now?

18:42.623 --> 18:44.291
We don't know for sure that they're runners,

18:44.708 --> 18:46.043
but I'll bet anything...

18:46.376 --> 18:47.669
that one's Ronon.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.630
Why? How do you know?

18:49.671 --> 18:50.923
That's Sateda.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.967
It's Ronon's home planet.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.721
That's a good enough place to start.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.998
<i>We have no choice.</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:28.001
We've been unable to dial in to Sateda's Stargate.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.711
The Wraith likely disabled it.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.463
Which means, if the Wraith are hunting Ronon,

19:31.505 --> 19:33.298
there's a very good chance
that there's a hive in orbit.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.511
I shouldn't have to remind you the Daedalus
has not done well in its last few
engagements with Wraith hive ships.

19:37.553 --> 19:40.931
We drop out of hyperspace, we beam
him onboard, we get out of there.

19:40.973 --> 19:46.603
You know damn well we can't come out of hyperspace
and get close enough to a planet to beam
someone off the surface. We'll be detected.

19:47.646 --> 19:48.730
<i>Look...</i>

19:49.398 --> 19:51.316
you know I want to help,

19:51.525 --> 19:55.988
but I will not put my crew and the only ship
that we have in this galaxy at risk for one man.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.283
- One man who isn't a member of the U.S. Military...
- I didn't say that!

19:59.324 --> 20:01.368
He's a member of my team...

20:01.660 --> 20:05.664
and he deserves the same respect
as anyone on this expedition.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.666
<i>We don't leave our people out there, Colonel.</i>

20:08.125 --> 20:09.501
Not if there's any chance.

20:09.543 --> 20:13.005
Don't preach to me about not
leaving people behind, Dr. Weir.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.638
I'm just saying it's a very bad risk-reward situation.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.599
Fine.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.350
Then just get us close.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.311
We'll take a cloaked Jumper the rest of the way.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.437
I'll go with them,

20:28.478 --> 20:31.106
remove the tracking device before we get back on board.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.609
We'll be out of there before the
Wraith even know what happened.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.611
I won't bail you out if you get in trouble.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.572
You say that as if we're always getting in trouble.

21:34.211 --> 21:37.756
- I'm out of ammo!
- There's a depot two blocks down. Go!

22:36.273 --> 22:38.442
You're gonna have to do better than that.

22:59.213 --> 23:02.674
<i>Sateda will not bow to invaders.</i>

23:02.716 --> 23:09.014
<i>The time has come for us to put our</i>
<i>bravery on the line and defend our nation,</i>

23:09.056 --> 23:10.349
<i>our planet.</i>

23:10.390 --> 23:13.477
- What are you doing?
<i>- All we have built these past two centuries...</i>

23:13.519 --> 23:15.938
<i>- Since the last culling...</i>
- I'm listening to the chieftan's speech.

23:16.396 --> 23:17.773
Why aren't you packing?

23:19.066 --> 23:22.569
I traded every last thing we had
to get you on Kell's personal staff.

23:22.611 --> 23:23.946
He's a criminal.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.990
- He's using people's fear for his own gain.
- He's a commander,

23:27.032 --> 23:29.034
and his staff gets to go through the Gate.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.286
The hospital's gonna need me.

23:31.912 --> 23:34.748
There's not gonna be any need for hospitals, Melena!

23:34.873 --> 23:36.667
That's just a bunch of words

23:36.708 --> 23:39.294
meant to make the people who don't get to leave

23:40.087 --> 23:42.130
think there's a chance for them.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.050
<i>We shot down two ships that came through the Gate.</i>

23:45.217 --> 23:46.343
Two

23:46.635 --> 23:48.136
small ships.

23:48.387 --> 23:50.806
Do you really think that's all they're gonna send?

23:51.682 --> 23:53.183
Of course not.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.979
Ships as big as our city have attacked other planets.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.357
No one that stays here is gonna survive.

24:02.234 --> 24:04.027
Then why are you staying?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.363
I have no choice.

24:06.405 --> 24:07.906
Yes, you do.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.950
You believe in this fight!

24:09.992 --> 24:13.161
You know that they'll eventually
find us no matter where we go.

24:13.245 --> 24:16.331
Our only hope is to show them
that we're not worth the effort,

24:16.456 --> 24:20.252
to go feed on some other planet
that won't fight back as hard as we will.

24:21.378 --> 24:22.588
<i>Ronon!</i>

24:23.964 --> 24:26.049
You can't run forever.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.201
Hey.

26:57.743 --> 26:59.411
Am I disturbing you?

26:59.453 --> 27:00.704
No.

27:01.622 --> 27:02.915
What's up?

27:04.541 --> 27:06.585
I just wanted to thank you.

27:06.627 --> 27:07.794
For what?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.672
For going after Ronon this way.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.800
Did you think we wouldn't?

27:14.968 --> 27:17.262
He is an outsider.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.806
Not to me.

27:22.309 --> 27:25.521
I have often felt like an outsider among your people.

27:26.438 --> 27:29.149
Well, maybe at first, but...

27:29.441 --> 27:31.360
well, you know I've always trusted you.

27:31.401 --> 27:32.653
Yes.

27:32.861 --> 27:36.740
You and Dr. Weir have been very accepting,

27:37.699 --> 27:40.077
but this has shown me how far you would go,

27:40.118 --> 27:43.080
even for someone who is not from your world.

27:48.544 --> 27:50.838
Look, Teyla...

27:50.879 --> 27:53.090
I'm not really good at...

27:54.007 --> 27:55.884
Actually, I'm...

27:56.009 --> 27:58.762
I'm terrible at expressing...

27:59.221 --> 28:01.473
I don't know what you'd call it...

28:02.015 --> 28:03.517
Feelings?

28:04.226 --> 28:05.978
Yeah, sure, okay.

28:06.103 --> 28:08.981
The point is, I don't really have good...

28:09.314 --> 28:10.774
Social skills.

28:12.401 --> 28:17.573
Well, that is why I enjoyed flying choppers
in the most remote part of my world

28:17.614 --> 28:20.033
before all this craziness happened, but...

28:20.242 --> 28:21.577
you should know,

28:21.618 --> 28:23.662
I don't have...

28:24.454 --> 28:25.831
Friends?

28:26.498 --> 28:27.457
No.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.876
I have friends.

28:32.963 --> 28:33.881
You...

28:34.006 --> 28:35.257
Elizabeth...

28:36.341 --> 28:37.593
Ronon,

28:37.885 --> 28:42.139
Carson, even Rodney,
are the closest thing I have to a...

28:42.264 --> 28:43.932
A family?

28:45.058 --> 28:46.685
I'd do anything...

28:48.061 --> 28:49.980
for any one of you.

28:52.941 --> 28:56.278
If I had to give up my life
the way Ronon was going to,

28:59.114 --> 29:00.324
I would.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.336
Thank you.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.506
For everything you...

29:15.672 --> 29:17.132
meant to say.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.167
Son of a...
you're killing me!

29:52.209 --> 29:55.838
I'm not even touching you. Seriously, Rodney,
I've never treated a bigger baby in my life.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.047
Just... are we done?

29:57.297 --> 29:58.173
Yes.

29:58.215 --> 29:59.299
It looks fine,

29:59.341 --> 30:00.467
considering.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.182
<i>Why did you come?</i>

30:07.349 --> 30:08.350
What do you mean?

30:08.392 --> 30:09.476
On this mission.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.435
<i>You're injured.</i>

30:10.477 --> 30:12.145
<i>You can't even sit down.</i>

30:12.312 --> 30:13.564
People wouldn't think any less of you.

30:13.605 --> 30:16.191
What, you think that's all I care about,
what people think of me?

30:16.275 --> 30:19.444
- Well, actually...
- Hey, I am a very caring person.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.866
Okay, maybe it's not always obvious to everyone, but...

30:23.907 --> 30:25.409
You care about what happens to Ronon?

30:25.450 --> 30:26.785
Yes, of course I do.

30:26.827 --> 30:27.911
What makes you think i wouldn't?

30:28.036 --> 30:30.706
Oh, I don't know,
the fact that you refer to him as "the caveman"

30:30.747 --> 30:33.166
- behind his back.
- That is a nickname.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.460
Buddies have nicknames for each other.

30:35.627 --> 30:36.170
Buddies?

30:36.211 --> 30:37.588
Oh, you're buddies now, are you?

30:37.629 --> 30:40.048
Yeah, more than that. He saved my life.
He's like a brother to me.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.175
Aye...

30:41.216 --> 30:42.801
a brother who got every gene you didn't,

30:42.843 --> 30:43.927
<i>and vice-versa.</i>

30:43.969 --> 30:46.388
You are just jealous of our relationship.

30:46.430 --> 30:47.639
Am I?

30:48.390 --> 30:50.434
In the year or so he's been with us,

30:50.517 --> 30:53.520
have you ever had a conversation with the man?

30:55.397 --> 30:57.065
We have an unspoken bond.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.818
I mean, there are things that go deeper than words,
my friend, deeper than words, but you..

30:59.860 --> 31:03.864
wouldn't know anything about that because
you never look past the surface of anyone, do you?

31:32.434 --> 31:34.978
<i>Melena! Melena!</i>

31:37.564 --> 31:38.649
<i>Melena!</i>

32:08.595 --> 32:09.805
<i>Melena!</i>

32:12.975 --> 32:14.017
Melena!

32:29.575 --> 32:30.617
Where's your squad?

32:30.659 --> 32:31.618
They're all dead.

32:31.702 --> 32:33.620
Kell used us to ensure his own escape.

32:33.704 --> 32:35.539
But there's still a chance. I can get us out of here.

32:35.581 --> 32:37.666
I can get us to the Gate, and even if we can't,
I know where to hide.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.792
Ronon!

32:46.049 --> 32:47.259
What about her?

32:47.551 --> 32:49.178
Her parents are both dead.

32:49.636 --> 32:50.596
Come here.

32:51.263 --> 32:52.222
Come on.

32:52.389 --> 32:53.974
Ronon, wait!

33:02.316 --> 33:04.109
What about all these people?

33:04.860 --> 33:06.236
They're all dead.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.157
I can't...

33:10.616 --> 33:13.035
I can't, Ronon.
I can't go.

33:48.278 --> 33:49.613
You're a coward.

33:55.536 --> 33:57.371
Don't look so surprised.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.084
<i>Are you okay?</i>

34:04.711 --> 34:05.712
Come on.

34:05.838 --> 34:06.922
You can thank us later.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.757
McKay and Beckett are waiting
for us in a Jumper on the roof.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.135
- Get out of here.
- Oh, hey...

34:12.261 --> 34:16.264
- I know you've been through a lot, but...
- I'm not going anywhere.

34:21.270 --> 34:22.312
What is going on down there?

34:22.353 --> 34:26.065
You have at least 25 Wraith closing in
on your position from ground level.

34:26.650 --> 34:29.277
It seems Ronon doesn't want to leave.

34:29.485 --> 34:32.614
Well, too bad!
You tell that ungrateful example of unevolved humanity

34:32.656 --> 34:34.658
that we came all this way to rescue him,
so he'd better get off his...

34:34.783 --> 34:38.453
McKay says he's very hurt you won't come with us.

34:38.495 --> 34:39.830
I can't.

34:40.581 --> 34:42.331
Keturah and his people...

34:42.916 --> 34:44.208
they had a deal.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.879
They traded me for their freedom.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.880
Are you doing this for them?

34:48.922 --> 34:52.134
Those people, the ones on the planet
who turned you over to the Wraith?

34:52.176 --> 34:54.136
It was my fault they were culled.

34:54.386 --> 34:55.596
<i>Ronon...</i>

34:56.471 --> 34:58.724
the Wraith didn't honor the deal.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.852
Keturah and his village, they're all dead.

35:04.438 --> 35:05.230
<i>Now...</i>

35:05.647 --> 35:06.940
can we go?

35:07.524 --> 35:08.358
No.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.444
Why not?

35:10.944 --> 35:14.114
Because I'm gonna kill the
Wraith responsible for all this.

35:15.240 --> 35:19.828
I don't suppose he happens to be one of the
ones out there that's about to come in here.

35:20.287 --> 35:21.330
No.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.957
He's probably still up on the hive.

35:24.374 --> 35:27.002
We can't take on a hive ship now.

35:28.712 --> 35:30.589
You won't have to.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.720
Why aren't you moving?

35:36.845 --> 35:39.473
<i>Ronon wants to take care of a few things first.</i>

35:39.640 --> 35:40.432
Oh, really?

35:40.474 --> 35:41.808
Like what?

35:44.394 --> 35:45.646
Come on.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.107
Let's go kill some Wraith.

35:55.781 --> 35:57.824
Just stay out of my way.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.036
Hey...

36:02.579 --> 36:04.206
thought you might want this.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.212
You're welcome.

36:11.588 --> 36:13.674
What the hell is going on down there?

36:13.715 --> 36:17.177
<i>Ronon thinks he can get the head Wraith responsible</i>
<i>for all this to come down and fight him if we</i>

36:17.219 --> 36:19.263
<i>kill all these Wraith first.</i>

36:22.933 --> 36:25.811
<i>That is the stupidest plan I have ever heard.</i>

36:25.853 --> 36:26.478
I don't know,

36:26.520 --> 36:29.064
killing a bunch of Wraith
always seems like a good idea to me.

36:29.106 --> 36:31.775
<i>They outnumber you 25 to three.</i>

36:31.817 --> 36:34.152
It's actually, 22 to three.

36:34.319 --> 36:35.404
21...

36:35.445 --> 36:37.781
And Ronon appears to be quite angry.

36:37.823 --> 36:38.907
Well, that evens it out.

36:38.949 --> 36:43.287
You do realize that there is a hive ship in orbit
capable of blowing us all off the face of this planet.

36:55.132 --> 36:55.799
Where do you think you're going?

36:55.841 --> 36:56.842
I'm going to help them.

36:56.884 --> 36:58.302
What are you, crazy?
You're a Doctor!

36:58.343 --> 37:00.262
What does that have to do with it?

37:02.264 --> 37:02.931
What are you doing?

37:02.973 --> 37:03.473
I'm going.

37:03.599 --> 37:04.558
You can barely walk.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.560
I can walk fine.
I just can't sit.

37:06.602 --> 37:09.688
- And you're a terrible shot.
- Oh, what and you're Rambo now?

37:13.192 --> 37:14.651
Oh, man...

37:56.818 --> 37:59.071
There's more than one bloody gun. We can both go.

37:59.112 --> 38:00.322
Well, someone has to stay with the Jumper...

38:00.364 --> 38:01.198
<i>That's it.</i>

38:01.240 --> 38:02.157
We got 'em all.

38:02.449 --> 38:03.742
McKay?

38:06.995 --> 38:08.664
Yeah, it's just you guys left.

38:09.081 --> 38:10.499
Well, that was quick.

38:10.916 --> 38:11.917
Well, I got six.

38:11.959 --> 38:12.918
Teyla got...

38:12.960 --> 38:14.044
Eight.

38:15.671 --> 38:18.507
I got nine, Teyla got eight, Ronon got the rest.

38:22.928 --> 38:25.055
<i>If you want to watch me die up close,</i>

38:25.097 --> 38:27.683
<i>you're just going to have to come</i>
<i>down here and do it yourself.</i>

38:29.142 --> 38:30.602
<i>You want me?</i>

38:32.229 --> 38:33.981
<i>Come get me!</i>

38:34.606 --> 38:35.983
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

38:40.696 --> 38:42.781
You kill him before I do,

38:42.823 --> 38:44.241
I kill you.

38:44.658 --> 38:46.577
What if he kills you first?

38:46.660 --> 38:48.120
Then you kill him.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.539
Got it.

39:44.134 --> 39:45.844
I could shoot him right now.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.433
I wouldn't.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.898
You really think Ronon would kill me?

39:57.981 --> 40:00.025
I think he wouldn't forgive you.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.867
I think he'd get over it.

40:08.992 --> 40:11.745
The hive has got to be watching.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.872
We shoot that Wraith,

40:13.914 --> 40:15.832
<i>they blast us all from space.</i>

40:55.747 --> 40:58.166
If he doesn't like it, he can sue me.

41:01.378 --> 41:02.754
I win.

41:31.325 --> 41:32.868
Go!

41:47.716 --> 41:48.842
Everyone okay?

41:49.176 --> 41:50.052
We are okay.

41:50.093 --> 41:52.054
Which one of you killed the Wraith?

41:52.888 --> 41:54.181
That would be me.

41:54.223 --> 41:55.307
My idea.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.228
Ronon...

41:59.603 --> 42:00.479
What?

42:00.854 --> 42:02.981
Don't tell me you're not happy that he's dead.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.399
I had him in my sights but...

42:04.441 --> 42:06.026
Ronon said he'd kill me if I shot him.

42:06.068 --> 42:07.569
It was all Beckett's idea.

42:11.323 --> 42:12.741
<i>Thanks, Doc.</i>

42:14.117 --> 42:15.911
What, him you thank?

42:16.662 --> 42:17.913
I could have killed him at any time,

42:17.955 --> 42:19.206
but Teyla wouldn't let me.

42:19.456 --> 42:20.749
Thank you.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.000
All of you.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.001
Oh, don't mention it.

42:23.043 --> 42:24.503
It's nothing, really.

42:24.545 --> 42:25.879
I only killed 11,

42:26.004 --> 42:27.589
12 Wraith.

42:27.631 --> 42:32.761
How about I get that tracking device out of you and
de-activated before that hive ship gets a bead on us?

42:32.803 --> 42:36.515
I take it this time you won't mind
if I give you a sedative?

42:39.226 --> 42:40.435
Or not.

42:45.524 --> 42:47.192
Who's flying the ship?

42:47.401 --> 42:48.569
Me.
