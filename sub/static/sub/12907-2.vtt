00:01.937 --> 00:06.072
May I introduce
“Everlasting’s” next suitor,

00:06.107 --> 00:10.276
pro quarterback Darius!

00:10.311 --> 00:11.344
He's black.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.546
He's like football black.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.780
What about this scandal?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.382
He called that reporter a bitch.

00:16.418 --> 00:17.783
I'm running the show.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.285
I can get you out of your P.R. problem.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.687
You and Quinn blew up
your life last season.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.389
- We worked it out.
- You got paid.

00:23.425 --> 00:26.259
Your mother called. She's
been talking to Jeremy again.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.704
Do you think I really wouldn't come back

00:27.704 --> 00:29.062
- because of you?
- Yeah.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.630
This show is my kingdom.
I'm gonna take it back.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.298
Get off of my set.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.435
Ladies, open your
hearts to your suitor...

00:36.470 --> 00:38.203
Where the hell is my suitor?

00:38.238 --> 00:39.939
You want to talk to him,
you got to deal with me.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.140
Quinn, if I keep following
you around like this,

00:42.176 --> 00:44.043
the crew's gonna have a really hard
time believing I'm the showrunner.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.078
I just got to steer us
past this train wreck

00:46.113 --> 00:48.780
and then I will hand
the show back to you.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.382
I want the girls to come to Darius

00:50.417 --> 00:51.983
in bikinis, poolside cocktails.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.618
Bring Darius to the mansion right now

00:53.653 --> 00:55.153
and I will ditch the evening gowns.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.888
I will give you a pool and the bikinis.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.256
May the best man win.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.391
She usually does.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.960
You have five hours
of hard night, folks.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.629
Ricardo, I love
the new twinkle lights!

01:04.664 --> 01:05.930
Fantastic!

01:07.266 --> 01:08.833
Bikinis?

01:08.868 --> 01:10.835
I wasn't ready for bikinis, Quinn.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.638
I was ready for gowns.
I need to prepare.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.941
You want to complain
to someone, see Chet.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.977
Apparently, he had some
caveman brain fart...

01:20.012 --> 01:21.245
Five hours.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.813
About how to fix something

01:22.848 --> 01:24.615
that wasn't even remotely
close to being broken.

01:24.650 --> 01:27.637
That's fine. If Chet's got
some ideas of taking the show

01:27.637 --> 01:27.918
in a new direction, great.

01:27.953 --> 01:29.620
I've got some long-gestating
thoughts of my own

01:29.655 --> 01:31.255
- I'd like to discuss with him.
- Mm, I'm sure you do.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.257
You know, I can sing, you know.

01:33.292 --> 01:34.992
You know, and I can shoot
ping-pong balls out of my vagina,

01:35.027 --> 01:36.660
but no one wants to see that, either.

01:36.695 --> 01:37.527
Well

01:37.562 --> 01:39.696
Please, stop talking.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.197
Where's Rachel?!

01:41.233 --> 01:43.634
Ping-pong balls out of
the vagina is fantastic.

What part of "five hours of hard night"

01:55.647 --> 01:57.013
did you not understand?

01:57.048 --> 01:58.548
You went 10-1 a half an hour ago.

How long does it take
to take out your tampon

Oh, you want to tell me where you were?

Just needed a minute.

That's great. I hope you feel refreshed.

We promised the network suicide ratings,

and we need to deliver.

02:54.437 --> 02:56.171
- Right.
- Just help me do this,

02:56.206 --> 02:58.239
and I will give you back the show.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.975

Oh, man. So bummed out right now.

03:09.285 --> 03:10.751
Why? What'd I do?

03:10.786 --> 03:12.386
No. It's what you didn't do.
What is this?

03:12.422 --> 03:14.121
They told us to change into bikinis.

03:14.156 --> 03:15.723
Yes, but, no, no, no. Not this one.

03:15.758 --> 03:17.424
Where's your other one?
The one from Instagram?

03:17.459 --> 03:19.893
The one with the flag on it?

03:19.929 --> 03:21.729
No. The one that you look amazing in.

03:21.764 --> 03:24.064
Come on. That bikini made
us come looking for you.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.601
I don't know. That's kind of
a hometown thing, you know?

03:27.636 --> 03:31.304
Th-There are a lot of, uh...
other kinds of people here.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.573
Are you embarrassed of who you are?

03:33.609 --> 03:36.243
Oh, I'm... I'm not embarrassed. No.

03:36.278 --> 03:38.778
You're not really a proud Southerner.

03:38.813 --> 03:40.247
Oh, my God.

03:40.282 --> 03:41.581
All that stuff you
told me during intake...

03:41.617 --> 03:42.716
Was that all just a lie?

03:42.751 --> 03:44.050
Oh, I-I'm not a liar.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.252
I just thought, "Look at this girl.

03:45.287 --> 03:48.554
This girl, she has got balls."

03:48.589 --> 03:49.822
I do have balls.

03:49.858 --> 03:51.257
Only when you're on the other side

03:51.292 --> 03:53.126
of a computer screen, you've got balls.

This bikini does not scream "balls."

All right. You want me to put it on?

03:56.330 --> 03:57.163
- Yes!
- I'll wear it.

03:57.198 --> 03:58.497
You're crazy.

03:58.532 --> 04:00.266
What the hell is that?!

04:00.301 --> 04:01.567
See?

04:01.602 --> 04:03.602
Come on. This is what I was afraid of.

04:03.638 --> 04:05.937
There is a lot of
misinformation out there.

04:05.973 --> 04:07.439
We need cameras over here now.

04:07.475 --> 04:09.408
A lot of people have
a real misunderstanding

04:09.443 --> 04:10.976
about what this flag is all about.

04:11.011 --> 04:12.844
Oh, you're right. It's me.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.080
I must just be plain ignorant.

04:15.115 --> 04:17.015
It's not an advertisement for racism.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.016
It doesn't say, "Yay! Slavery!"

04:18.051 --> 04:19.951
Come on. Oh, here we go.

04:19.987 --> 04:21.418
- Need people here now.
- You know what? My daddy had family

04:21.454 --> 04:22.988
who fought and died in the Civil War.

04:23.023 --> 04:25.757
And, for the record, it had
nothing to do with slavery.

04:25.793 --> 04:27.625
That is a revisionist crock of...

04:27.661 --> 04:29.828
- Read a book.
- Come on. Where is everyone?

04:29.863 --> 04:32.931
You know what? You might
be ashamed of your heritage,

04:32.966 --> 04:35.167
but I have a feeling that the suitor

04:35.202 --> 04:37.535
is going to appreciate my honesty.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.070
You dumb bitch. He's black.

04:41.308 --> 04:43.274
Where's Jay?

04:43.310 --> 04:45.376
Excuse me.

04:45.412 --> 04:47.178
What are you doing?

04:47.213 --> 04:48.946
I just told you that
stuff in confidence.

04:48.981 --> 04:50.648
What are you doing?

04:50.684 --> 04:52.317
You're gonna put that garbage
on national television?

04:52.352 --> 04:54.551
Yes, so you have
something to push against

04:54.586 --> 04:56.887
- to promote your message.
- Then what's the problem?

04:56.923 --> 04:59.156
You need to do it when
the cameras are on.

04:59.192 --> 05:01.358
Hey. Sorry. I was just helping
Tiffany with her nipple covers.

05:01.393 --> 05:02.693
What's up?

05:02.728 --> 05:04.895
So, if you don't want
me to steal your girls,

05:04.931 --> 05:07.164
can you get your head
out of Tiffany's vagina

05:07.200 --> 05:09.566
and explain to this
ding-dong how the show works?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.501
Okay, relax, Rachel.

05:11.537 --> 05:13.303

05:14.272 --> 05:15.972
Mnh. This is temporary.

05:16.007 --> 05:17.307
Maybe.

05:19.511 --> 05:22.011
I really think that that
bikini's the way to go.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.416
Hey. You okay?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.952
Yeah, I'm fine, but look,

05:28.987 --> 05:30.619
I'm starting to feel
like this is a setup...

05:30.655 --> 05:31.888
Like, I'm just here to fight that girl.

05:31.923 --> 05:35.091
No. Come on, Ruby. You are so important.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.860
Why? Because he asked for me?

05:36.895 --> 05:37.961
What?

05:37.996 --> 05:38.962
Rachel said that the suitor

05:38.997 --> 05:40.429
asked for me specifically.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.798
She also said that I was guaranteed

05:42.834 --> 05:44.400
to make it to the final two,

05:44.435 --> 05:46.301
that I'd have nine weeks
to promote our platform.

05:46.337 --> 05:47.583
I don't know.
You should probably just...

05:47.583 --> 05:49.115
Just tell me, please.

05:49.328 --> 05:50.653
Can I trust her?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.414
No.

05:59.449 --> 06:00.883
Ah, shit.

06:00.918 --> 06:03.118
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
But she's lying to you.

06:03.153 --> 06:05.420
He didn't ask for you. You're just...

06:05.455 --> 06:07.756
You're the angry black bitch
who'll be gone in two episodes,

06:07.791 --> 06:08.991
three if you're lucky.

06:09.026 --> 06:12.327
Oh, my God. What did I just do?

06:12.363 --> 06:14.897
- I dropped out of college for this.
- I'm pissed, too,

06:14.932 --> 06:16.664
and not because I wanted to
watch you "rail against the man"

06:16.700 --> 06:18.466
- for the next nine weeks.
- Excuse me? Is that what you think...

06:18.502 --> 06:20.167
It is a whole new deal this year, Ruby.

06:20.203 --> 06:23.070
If a girl like you ever
had a shot, this is it.

06:23.106 --> 06:25.339

want to make a difference?

I will make it my personal
mission to get you there,

06:33.950 --> 06:37.484
but you have to listen
to me, not Rachel.

06:38.955 --> 06:40.288

06:40.323 --> 06:42.790
Okay.

package from your mom.

Mnh, I did. It's in the trash.

07:06.181 --> 07:07.847
Rachel, you need to be careful.

07:07.882 --> 07:10.150
Quinn taking the show back
could be a real trigger for you,

07:10.185 --> 07:11.551
destabilize you.

You've clearly learned nothing

09:55.601 --> 09:56.578
Looks like Mom and
Dad are fighting again.

09:56.613 --> 09:59.547
Quasi-producing your own show,

09:59.583 --> 10:03.418
because, let me tell
you, you can't play music.

10:03.453 --> 10:05.686
There's no way to edit around it.

10:05.722 --> 10:09.189
Jeremy! Get me a tight on Darius.

10:09.225 --> 10:11.025
He is our prince, supposedly.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.027
No, no, no! No, no, no! No. Stay wide.

10:13.062 --> 10:15.029
I want scope. I want the party, man.

10:15.064 --> 10:17.732
No more of this pansy-ass
Cinderella bullshit, man!

10:17.767 --> 10:21.102
Guys, my crew's gonna mutiny.
Who's... Who's in charge here?

10:21.137 --> 10:23.037
- I am.
- I am.

10:23.072 --> 10:24.671
Look, I don't want to fight, okay?

10:24.706 --> 10:26.706
So why don't you shoot your
show, I'll shoot my show?

10:26.742 --> 10:27.941
We'll turn them both in to the network.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.075
We'll see which one they prefer...

10:29.111 --> 10:31.211
The entertaining one or yours.

10:31.247 --> 10:33.847
You're so on. Rachel, come on.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.682
Quinn, I just want to
go on the record and say

10:35.717 --> 10:38.452
that I do not feel comfortable
about where this is headed.

10:38.487 --> 10:39.453
Oh! Okay.

10:39.488 --> 10:40.586
What record?

10:40.622 --> 10:41.955
- There's no record.
- Uh, hey!

10:41.990 --> 10:44.524
Uh, guys, Rachel's
gonna go on the record!

10:46.094 --> 10:47.927
You know what, Jeremy?
I need some one-on-ones

10:47.963 --> 10:50.030
- over at the gazebo, please?
- Go ahead, Jeremy.

10:50.065 --> 10:51.798
You know, just go into the henhouse

10:51.833 --> 10:53.299
and let your sack shrivel up.

10:53.334 --> 10:55.201
This henhouse made him.

10:55.236 --> 10:57.436
Do you think a B camera 2nd AC

10:57.472 --> 10:59.372
can grow up and become a DP

10:59.407 --> 11:01.607
in less than five years on
any other show in Hollywood?

11:01.643 --> 11:03.543
So he's supposed to spend
the rest of his career

11:03.578 --> 11:05.144
bowing to the mercy of your twat?!

11:05.180 --> 11:07.112
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. That was out of line.

11:07.148 --> 11:08.447
Your twat!

11:08.483 --> 11:09.649
- Excuse me?
- Chet.

11:09.684 --> 11:10.632
Don't "Chet" me.

11:10.632 --> 11:14.086
Do you not want to be a
director? Did we not talk?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.322
Yes.

11:17.357 --> 11:19.792
So you really need one of these harpies

11:19.827 --> 11:22.061
squawking into your
earpiece all night long?

11:22.096 --> 11:23.495
No. You know what to shoot.

11:23.530 --> 11:27.766
Get a pair! Walk with purpose.

11:27.802 --> 11:29.601
I'm going with Chet!

11:29.636 --> 11:30.768
'Course you are.

11:30.804 --> 11:33.405
Okay. Hey, Bill!

11:33.440 --> 11:34.506
It's Barry.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.840
Barry. Right.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.108
You have a kid in college.

11:37.143 --> 11:38.976
Actually, it's preschool.

11:39.012 --> 11:41.779
Whatever. It's 5 grand
for you to come to

11:41.815 --> 11:42.914
Team We Know What The Hell We're Doing.

11:42.949 --> 11:43.848
Ticktock, buddy.

11:43.883 --> 11:45.650
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:45.686 --> 11:48.786
And have a great night.

11:48.822 --> 11:50.888
Come on, Rachel. Let's go.

11:52.992 --> 11:55.827
All right. Come on.
We'll shoot these guys.

11:56.699 --> 11:59.268
This is gonna look like
nobody is in charge.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.536
Yeah, but he should've never
been allowed on the set.

12:01.572 --> 12:03.839
After the fiasco of
last season's finale...

12:03.874 --> 12:05.039
He's like a freakin' whack-a-mole.

12:05.075 --> 12:06.508
Fine. Just call the network, then.

12:06.543 --> 12:08.076
- Tell them.
- It's not the network.

12:08.111 --> 12:10.278
It's Gary, his golfing buddy.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.514
They go skiing together at Park City.

12:12.549 --> 12:13.882
You know what?
Let me just talk to Darius.

12:13.882 --> 12:16.250
- I can talk some sense...
- No. This is grown-up time, all right?

12:16.286 --> 12:18.720
Way over your head. What do you want?

12:18.755 --> 12:21.365
Beth Ann's locked in her
bathroom and she won't let me in.

12:21.391 --> 12:23.091
Go. Fix it.

12:26.262 --> 12:28.396
Quinn. Hey.
You know, um, Chet's guy thing?

12:28.431 --> 12:29.663
Stop talking to me!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.800
Beth Ann, it's Rachel. Can I come in?

12:32.835 --> 12:33.701
No.

12:38.407 --> 12:39.640
- Stupid idiot.
- I'm sorry.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.941
All right. What's the problem?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.242
Hmm? You knew the guy was black.

12:42.277 --> 12:44.778
I didn't know that it was Darius Beck.

12:44.814 --> 12:47.982
We love him... Like, worship him.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.418
He is literally my
favorite quarterback ever.

12:51.453 --> 12:53.721
You got to find my bag.
I need to change.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.555
Unh-unh. No. You can't do that.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.424
Can't you just cut me
out of the opening scene,

12:57.459 --> 12:58.958
make it like I was never even there?

12:58.994 --> 13:01.061
And what? Are you just
gonna let the PC police win?

13:01.096 --> 13:03.296
You know, I was not raised to be rude.

13:03.332 --> 13:06.166
Besides, I like Darius.
I want him to like me.

13:06.201 --> 13:08.902
I mean, this is better than I
ever thought this show could be.

13:08.937 --> 13:11.504
Racism is so confusing, isn't it?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.972
So, are you gonna let me change?

13:13.008 --> 13:14.440
You can't do that.

13:14.475 --> 13:17.010
Darius has already seen
you in that bathing suit,

13:17.045 --> 13:19.846
and plus, all those other girls
are just gonna blend into one.

13:19.881 --> 13:22.348
At least you're gonna stand out,
and he's gonna know who you are.

13:22.383 --> 13:24.784
You have a real golden opportunity here.

13:24.819 --> 13:27.920
Right, and what's the
worst that can happen?

13:27.955 --> 13:30.022
He meets you and falls in love with you,

13:30.058 --> 13:31.857
and, like, marries you
and has all your babies?

13:31.892 --> 13:33.959
Right? Now let's get back out there.

13:33.994 --> 13:35.594
Can I keep my jacket?

13:35.629 --> 13:37.096
Come on. Let's go.

13:37.131 --> 13:40.032
Hey. You're a cop, right?

13:40.068 --> 13:43.102
Can't you just arrest her?

13:43.137 --> 13:45.103
I'm an MMA fighter.

13:45.138 --> 13:48.006
Do you want me to just
beat the crap out of her?

13:48.042 --> 13:50.341
Cop. Right. I'm guessing that's a "no."

13:50.377 --> 13:54.780
♪♪

13:54.815 --> 13:57.816
Ooh. Gosh. Really classy.

13:57.851 --> 13:59.585
You didn't seem to mind in Vegas.

14:02.155 --> 14:04.655
So, hey, hey. You guys,
uh... You guys hooked up?

14:04.691 --> 14:07.058
Oh, yeah, but it was no big deal.

14:07.094 --> 14:10.295
But that girl is a freak
couldn't get enough.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.876
She is crazy.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.065
You know what I'm saying?

14:13.066 --> 14:14.699
Yeah. No, I do.

14:14.734 --> 14:17.068
She's got a doctor's note
that says the same thing.

14:17.103 --> 14:18.502
She got problems, man.

14:18.537 --> 14:21.171
Um, Madison, there's girl-on-girl action

14:21.207 --> 14:23.173
in the hot tub, which is
good and dandy and everything,

14:23.209 --> 14:25.175
but this particular
party is about penis.

14:25.211 --> 14:26.711
I'm telling you,

14:26.746 --> 14:29.046
this is going to be the
best night of your...

14:29.082 --> 14:30.748
Hey, guys. Just get out
of here, please. Thank you.

14:30.783 --> 14:32.817
But Chet said I could
loosen things up a bit.

14:32.852 --> 14:34.384
I know. I love the frat-party vibe.

14:34.420 --> 14:36.553
It's great, but right now we
got to talk to some ladies.

14:36.589 --> 14:38.855
- Her name is Beth Ann.
- Beth Ann.

14:38.890 --> 14:40.653
Here she is. Here, sweetie.
Let me take your coat for you.

14:40.653 --> 14:41.691
- How you doing, Beth Ann?
- Okay.

14:43.295 --> 14:44.528
- There you go.
- Wait! Okay.

14:44.563 --> 14:46.663
First off, I have to say I'm sorry.

14:46.698 --> 14:48.265
I owe you an apology.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.734
I've dreamt of meeting you
probably about a zillion times,

14:50.769 --> 14:53.536
and I definitely wasn't wearing
this in any of those dreams.

14:53.571 --> 14:54.738
Right. Okay.

14:54.773 --> 14:56.740
I love where I'm from.

14:56.775 --> 14:58.842
I do, but I know that this flag

14:58.877 --> 15:01.611
pushes a lot of buttons for your people.

15:01.647 --> 15:03.947
- My people?
- No. That... That's not what I meant.

15:03.982 --> 15:07.416
It came out wrong. It's
just, Darius, this is a party,

15:07.452 --> 15:09.118
and... and we're supposed to
be having a good time, so...

15:09.154 --> 15:10.419
Right.

15:10.455 --> 15:12.622
So if what I'm wearing offends you,

15:12.657 --> 15:14.890
then there really is
only one thing that I can do,

15:14.925 --> 15:17.527
and it's real simple.

15:17.562 --> 15:19.228
Whoo!

15:19.264 --> 15:21.930
Oh, my God.

15:21.966 --> 15:23.198
Slut.

15:23.233 --> 15:26.035
I feel so much better.

15:26.070 --> 15:27.970
How 'bout you? How do you feel?

15:30.741 --> 15:32.074
Oh.

15:32.109 --> 15:33.375
I feel better, too.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.544
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:35.579 --> 15:37.046
That's really sweet.

15:37.081 --> 15:38.981
- Here, let me button that for you.
- Sorry.

15:39.016 --> 15:42.617
It's not a catfight, but I can
turn that hot mess into gold.

15:42.653 --> 15:45.787
Don't cover the boobies!
Oh, we missed the boobies!

15:45.822 --> 15:47.989
It's like a tree falling in the forest.

15:48.024 --> 15:50.792
Oh, we have them on camera.

15:50.827 --> 15:55.297
You did, uh, girl-on-girl
action in the hot tub, right?

15:55.332 --> 15:58.566
False alarm.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.568
So, that's how you're
gonna play it, huh?

16:00.603 --> 16:03.004
Oh, come on.

16:03.039 --> 16:05.439
Getting what you want... That's
what the show's all about.

16:05.474 --> 16:08.976
You created it, remember?

16:09.012 --> 16:10.611
It's your kingdom.

16:10.646 --> 16:12.013
Come and get it.

16:12.048 --> 16:14.081
♪♪

16:16.733 --> 16:18.200
I'm sorry, but I cannot

16:18.235 --> 16:19.974
physically stop myself
from saying something.

16:19.974 --> 16:20.937
Will you compose yourself?
Just take a breath.

16:20.937 --> 16:21.904
No. Absolutely not.

16:21.905 --> 16:25.239
I stood there like a good,
quiet, little Negro for you,

16:25.275 --> 16:27.141
but that shirt business was too much.

16:27.177 --> 16:29.210
He was just being a gentleman.

16:29.245 --> 16:30.479
He was being a pussy.

16:30.514 --> 16:32.146
Look, your long game might make sense,

16:32.182 --> 16:34.048
but why the hell would
I want to stick around

16:34.084 --> 16:35.884
to fake fall in love with that sellout?

16:35.919 --> 16:37.918
Look, I get it, okay? Believe me.

16:37.954 --> 16:40.221
But the only reason
Darius is on the show

16:40.256 --> 16:42.123
is to repair his image,

16:42.158 --> 16:44.558
and that shirt move
is exactly the kind of nonsense

16:44.594 --> 16:46.227
that's gonna do it. I'm serious.

16:46.262 --> 16:48.390
Marketing will be
focus-grouping the hashtag

16:48.390 --> 16:49.296
before the end of the night.

16:49.296 --> 16:50.898
# IAmAPussy.

16:53.703 --> 16:56.103
Listen to me. Listen to me.

16:56.138 --> 16:58.739
Who knows how long
Beth Ann will actually

16:58.774 --> 17:00.340
stick around for, okay?
She's not gonna win.

17:00.376 --> 17:01.976
Even Obama had to make compromises.

17:02.011 --> 17:04.778
Not with the Confederate Flag. Ever.

17:04.814 --> 17:08.682
Look, if Darius wants to cut
me for having a point of view

17:08.718 --> 17:12.085
that he should have himself, so be it.

17:12.121 --> 17:13.752
At least I'll go home with my dignity.

17:17.559 --> 17:19.226
All right, so tell me what happened

17:19.261 --> 17:20.827
with my catfight and the parka.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.662
I don't know. My girl was ready to go,

17:22.698 --> 17:24.464
and then Ruby just didn't take the bait.

17:24.499 --> 17:25.998
Or Jay told her not to.

17:26.034 --> 17:28.667
Look, this job is so
important to me, and I just...

17:28.703 --> 17:31.637
I really want to be good at
it, and basically be like you.

17:31.672 --> 17:33.639
Okay, Madison. No, having you in my ear,

17:33.674 --> 17:36.308
taking down Chantal, that was
like a drug or an orgasm or...

17:36.344 --> 17:37.543
Okay.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.712
All I know is I want more.

17:39.748 --> 17:43.149
And you're Quinn now,
so let me be Rachel.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.985
Knock yourself out.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.220
Really?

17:48.256 --> 17:49.855
Yeah.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.890
No. N-N-N-No.

17:51.925 --> 17:53.592
Ruby, stop.

17:53.628 --> 17:55.694
You can't wear this on
camera. It's a copyright issue.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.663
Watch me.

17:57.698 --> 17:59.197
Jesus.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.799
Hey, Ruby.

18:02.302 --> 18:03.735
Looky, looky. What do you see?

18:06.974 --> 18:08.406
- She's a wifey.
- Exactly.

18:08.441 --> 18:09.941
That's Quinn's golden
goose right there...

18:09.977 --> 18:12.510
unattended, ripe for the picking.

18:12.545 --> 18:14.545
She is exactly what Quinn needs

18:14.581 --> 18:17.282
in order to build her vagina of a show.

18:17.317 --> 18:19.350
Without a wifey, Quinn's got nothing.

18:19.386 --> 18:21.452
Watch and learn, my
friend. Watch and learn.

18:21.488 --> 18:23.921
- Okay, so are we gonna finish?
- Thank you. It was very good.

18:23.956 --> 18:25.723
- Perfect.
- They don't even ask me a question.

18:25.759 --> 18:30.428
You are the hottest girl here.
Why am I completely flaccid?

18:30.463 --> 18:32.764
I'm not even kidding.
Feel this. I got nothing.

18:32.799 --> 18:35.766
And now I want to be here even less.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.067
What is it? Hormones?

18:37.103 --> 18:39.436
Do you eat a lot of processed cheese?

18:39.471 --> 18:41.371
I want to help you.
I'm very good at this.

18:41.407 --> 18:44.108
There is nothing wrong
with me. This is about him.

18:44.143 --> 18:46.743
Did my dad call you?

18:46.779 --> 18:48.145
Ask you to put me on the show?

18:48.181 --> 18:50.213
Because your dad is...?

18:50.248 --> 18:52.115
A team owner who knows that Darius

18:52.150 --> 18:55.151
has a contract negotiation coming up...

18:55.187 --> 18:58.555
And while he can't talk
to him directly, I sure can.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.223
- Hm.
- So typical of him, you know...

19:00.258 --> 19:01.891
Using me as bait to get what he wants.

19:01.927 --> 19:04.961
I-I came on this show to
get away from football,

19:04.996 --> 19:07.130
to get out of my father's shadow,

19:07.165 --> 19:08.798
to create something separate for myself.

19:08.834 --> 19:10.633
Well, you should totally do that.

19:10.668 --> 19:12.101
This is America after all.

19:12.137 --> 19:14.570
No. I'm just gonna
fade into the woodwork

19:14.605 --> 19:16.105
until Darius sends me home.

19:16.141 --> 19:18.074
Quinn would never let Darius cut you.

19:18.109 --> 19:19.742
You know why? 'Cause you're
what they call a "wifey."

19:19.777 --> 19:22.845
That is what everybody
thinks. I am so not that girl.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.814
Well, prove it. If you
really want to go home,

19:24.849 --> 19:27.015
there is one thing pretty much every guy

19:27.051 --> 19:30.018
across the board does not want
their potential wife to do.

19:30.054 --> 19:31.987
Yeah? What's that? Screw their friends?

19:32.022 --> 19:33.922
Go big and go home, baby.

19:35.393 --> 19:36.425
- Rachel.
- Yes?

19:36.461 --> 19:37.660
You're Rachel, right?

19:37.695 --> 19:39.194
Wow. You are totally cute,

19:39.230 --> 19:41.029
and can I just say, thank God.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.430
Oh, wow.

19:42.466 --> 19:44.532
Everyone keeps saying
how much we look alike.

19:44.568 --> 19:45.800
Yeah, that's not exactly
what they're saying.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.336
- Hey, Rach. Hi. Just one second.
- What?

19:47.371 --> 19:48.703
Just want to know what you
want to do about the rain.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.638
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:50.674 --> 19:51.720
Seriously? You need to talk to Chet.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.976
- Wait. I'm not talking to...
- You need to talk to Chet.

19:52.977 --> 19:54.642
It's totally embarrassing
and completely inaccurate.

19:54.678 --> 19:56.378
I mean, I'm just
wearing a ton of makeup.

19:56.413 --> 19:58.012
Yeah. Totally.

19:58.047 --> 19:59.514
And I mean, is it really
such a freakish thing to have

19:59.549 --> 20:01.483
two smart, brown-haired,

20:01.518 --> 20:03.217
East Coast Jews in the same place?

20:03.253 --> 20:04.665
Well, I'm not from the East Coast,

20:04.689 --> 20:05.721
- So...
- Really?

20:05.722 --> 20:07.971
You have such a New York vibe.
Where'd you go to college?

20:07.971 --> 20:08.680
Vassar.

20:08.704 --> 20:09.324
Oh, my God.

20:09.325 --> 20:10.859
I've got a ton of friends
who went to Vassar.

20:10.894 --> 20:12.559
Is there something that you want, Yael.

20:12.595 --> 20:15.363
Can we be honest? I mean, can we talk?

20:15.398 --> 20:17.131
You mean like a Hebe to Hebe?

20:17.166 --> 20:18.632
Help a sister out.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.667
This guy is hot,
and he hasn't even looked at me.

20:20.703 --> 20:22.003
I just need some advice.

20:22.038 --> 20:23.470
You know the show. What would you do?

20:23.506 --> 20:26.073
You want my advice? Come here.

20:26.109 --> 20:28.242
You see your producer, Madison?
The one holding the shirt?

20:28.278 --> 20:29.376
You stick with her.

20:29.412 --> 20:31.412
That girl is a genius.

20:36.786 --> 20:38.752
Can I steal him?

20:38.788 --> 20:41.988
I'm sorry. Can you put this on?

20:42.024 --> 20:44.825
Otherwise, I'm not gonna be
able to look you in the eye.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.693
The rest of you is just too...

20:47.729 --> 20:49.396
distracting.

20:49.431 --> 20:50.696
All right, I'll put this on.

20:50.732 --> 20:51.998
These two are like Ken and Barbie.

20:52.034 --> 20:52.999
- I love them.
- Ugh.

20:53.035 --> 20:54.100
It's called a cotillion.

20:54.136 --> 20:55.668
My mom has been planning mine

20:55.703 --> 20:56.836
since the day I was born.

20:56.871 --> 20:58.338
Ah, that's sweet.

20:58.373 --> 20:59.839
I bet you look amazing in a tux.

20:59.874 --> 21:02.575
Well, my mother says
I do clean up nicely.

21:02.610 --> 21:04.276
I'm sure you do.

21:04.312 --> 21:06.611
Come here.

21:06.647 --> 21:08.981
Um...

21:11.419 --> 21:13.252
What? Is everything okay?

21:13.287 --> 21:15.720
Oh, yeah. I-I just...

21:15.756 --> 21:18.123
never do that on the first date.

21:18.159 --> 21:19.624
- Bam!
- We can take it slow.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.293
That's a black wifey. That's a blifey.

21:21.329 --> 21:23.895
Okay, you can pat
your liberal white self

21:23.931 --> 21:24.896
on the back later, all right?

21:26.299 --> 21:28.533
Hi, Darius. Could I
talk to you for a minute?

21:28.569 --> 21:31.069
Yeah, let's talk
about that t-shirt, Darius.

21:31.104 --> 21:32.203
Nice shirt.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.273
Well, hello, there.

21:35.308 --> 21:37.709
Can I get you something to drink or...?

21:37.744 --> 21:39.978
Yeah.

21:40.013 --> 21:43.914
No. Look, I, um, just
wanted to talk to you.

21:43.950 --> 21:45.649
Let me guess... this is
not your scene, is it?

21:45.685 --> 21:47.452
No.

21:47.487 --> 21:49.320
Look, I'm not really
sure what I'm doing here.

21:49.356 --> 21:51.122
I mean, I just watched you create

21:51.157 --> 21:52.790
some racial rainbow moment

21:52.825 --> 21:54.992
with a bitch in a damn
Confederate Flag bikini, so...

21:55.027 --> 21:56.594
Finally, some conflict.

21:56.629 --> 21:59.096
This means something.
This has a point of view.

21:59.131 --> 22:01.131
I think we should just put
this entire thing in the cut.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.501
I mean, at least to the part
where she calls her a bitch,

22:03.536 --> 22:05.435
because the rest is a little PBS.

22:05.471 --> 22:09.272
I mean, I know you think you're
televising the revolution,

22:09.308 --> 22:11.375
but what we need right
now are wet panties.

22:12.978 --> 22:15.812
Where is Tiffany, my NFL girl?

22:15.847 --> 22:17.080
Oh! Ah!

22:17.116 --> 22:18.648
Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

22:18.683 --> 22:19.749
No, no, no. Go. That's my wifey!

22:19.784 --> 22:21.618
Go, Rachel. Go!

22:21.653 --> 22:24.087
Get her. Find her.
Kno... No, no, no, no, no!

22:24.123 --> 22:25.422
Get off your knees!

22:25.457 --> 22:28.157
Sta... Wi... I need a walkie! No! No!

22:28.192 --> 22:31.628
Of course this is your
version of a good idea.

22:33.131 --> 22:34.163
- Oh, gosh!
- Hi.

22:38.202 --> 22:40.537
Please stay right here.
Do not talk to anyone.

22:40.572 --> 22:42.371
Do not talk to Chet.

22:42.407 --> 22:43.540
What are you doing?

22:43.575 --> 22:45.707
Sorry, Rach. You jealous?

22:45.743 --> 22:47.309
Please don't flatter yourself.

22:47.345 --> 22:49.345
You really think that
that's gonna help Darius?

22:49.380 --> 22:50.846
I'm just having a good time.

22:50.881 --> 22:53.182
Mm-hmm. Yes. Chet is manipulating you.

22:53.217 --> 22:54.783
And you're not?

22:54.818 --> 22:56.818
As far as I can tell, everyone's
manipulating everybody.

22:56.854 --> 22:58.187
Yes, but I am the only one

22:58.222 --> 23:00.722
that is doing it for the right reasons.

23:00.758 --> 23:03.391
You can't tell Darius about
hooking up with Tiffany.

23:03.427 --> 23:04.304
Why not?

23:04.304 --> 23:06.029
'Cause if you want
that sportscaster deal

23:06.030 --> 23:07.896
and all that stuff
that Chet promised you,

23:07.932 --> 23:10.131
she's what you need to make it happen.

23:10.167 --> 23:13.501
Okay? The girl is blonde,
beautiful, rich, and white.

23:13.537 --> 23:17.039
If a girl like that forgives
you, America forgives you.

23:17.074 --> 23:18.706
Not a word.

23:22.299 --> 23:24.100
Pervert.

23:24.135 --> 23:25.535
We have two hours
hard night left, folks.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.437
Okay, look,
I don't know what you expected,

23:27.473 --> 23:29.873
but I'm not just going to
do whatever my dad wants.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.641
He can't offer me up as
some kind of marketing ploy.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.279
I really, honestly, have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.747
You applied, I found you.

23:38.783 --> 23:40.783
Wait, no. You didn't talk to my dad?

23:40.818 --> 23:42.418
I didn't talk to your dad.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.786
Oh, my God.

23:46.491 --> 23:47.756
Oh, that just felt like

23:47.792 --> 23:50.059
something that he would do, you know?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.727
I mean, I thought I
got into Wharton, too,

23:51.762 --> 23:53.429
until I found out that
he made some phone calls.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.163
Oh, my God, your dad
helped you get into Wharton?

23:55.199 --> 23:57.967
Ugh. Rich-girl problems are the worst.

23:58.002 --> 24:01.504
Look, you may have called,
but I still said yes.

24:01.539 --> 24:03.506
I was excited to come here.

24:03.541 --> 24:05.073
I actually thought that
I might meet someone.

24:05.109 --> 24:06.274
Oh, and you did.

24:06.310 --> 24:07.910
No, you guys ruined that night one.

24:07.945 --> 24:09.612
Come on. Darius is still a person.

24:09.647 --> 24:11.613
Darius is a football player.

24:11.648 --> 24:14.349
- And?
- I don't want to be a football wife.

24:14.385 --> 24:17.452
I have done that my
entire life with my dad.

24:17.488 --> 24:19.787
I smile, I keep my mouth shut,

24:19.823 --> 24:23.525
provide excellent arm
candy, and I am done.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.193
But if you don't want
people to judge you

24:25.229 --> 24:26.361
or make assumptions about you,

24:26.397 --> 24:27.795
then you can't do that to Darius.

24:27.831 --> 24:29.363
You're saying he's
not a football player?

24:29.399 --> 24:31.198
I'm just saying that you
have no idea what he is.

24:31.234 --> 24:33.200
He could be anything. The
guy could be your soul mate.

24:33.236 --> 24:35.302
Crazier things have happened.

24:35.338 --> 24:38.640
I just think you should make
yourself open to the experience.

24:38.675 --> 24:41.943
I'm just saying. He's a really good guy.

24:41.978 --> 24:44.145
What do you want me to do?

24:44.180 --> 24:47.181
I want you to pray to God
that Romeo keeps his mouth shut

24:47.216 --> 24:49.216
and none of that stuff makes it to air.

24:49.252 --> 24:50.484
You have to help me.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.887
Jay, enough
of the black activist.

24:53.923 --> 24:55.689
- Get my wifey in there.
- This is all you. Go, go, go!

24:55.724 --> 24:57.057
Listen, why don't we discuss...

24:58.250 --> 24:59.080
Hi.

24:59.227 --> 25:01.027
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

25:01.063 --> 25:02.895
Can I steal you for a minute?

25:02.931 --> 25:04.364
Definitely.

25:04.399 --> 25:06.299
I think we were done here, right?

25:06.335 --> 25:09.769
Okay.

25:09.804 --> 25:14.207
And besides, I've been
meaning to talk to you anyway.

25:14.242 --> 25:16.409
You know nothing about Texas.

25:16.445 --> 25:17.643
I'm from Texas. I grew up there.

25:17.679 --> 25:18.911
No, I've... Doesn't matter.

25:18.947 --> 25:20.546
I spent my entire career in Texas.

25:20.582 --> 25:22.414
- I know Texas.
- No, no, no, no, no. I love Texas...

25:22.450 --> 25:23.950
- Okay.
- But you have to admit,

25:23.985 --> 25:26.218
barbecue was decidedly second-rate.

25:26.253 --> 25:27.620
You haven't been to
County Line, have you?

25:27.655 --> 25:29.221
No, yes, I have. My dad took me there.

25:29.256 --> 25:30.389
Yo...

25:33.827 --> 25:35.427
Look, why don't we knock all this off

25:35.463 --> 25:37.396
and just talk about the
elephant in the room?

25:40.634 --> 25:42.667
I thought you shut that down, Rachel.

25:42.703 --> 25:46.338
If you didn't protect my wifey,
we're gonna have a real problem.

25:46.374 --> 25:49.174
I know your dad owns the
team that happens to be

25:49.210 --> 25:51.075
our biggest competition in the league.

25:51.111 --> 25:53.745
He's been cock-blocking us for
years with his deep pockets.

25:56.650 --> 25:58.449
My dad.

25:58.485 --> 26:00.018
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:00.053 --> 26:02.654
Okay. You want to go there?

26:02.689 --> 26:04.523
When are you gonna get out of the box

26:04.558 --> 26:06.357
and start using your damn legs?

26:06.393 --> 26:07.958
Your footwork is terrible.

26:07.994 --> 26:10.094
It was a pleasure meeting
you. You're eliminated.

26:10.130 --> 26:10.760
Oh, no!

26:10.760 --> 26:12.498
How could you do me like that?

26:12.499 --> 26:14.698
This is the show, Rachel.

26:14.734 --> 26:17.301
- Thank God I'm here.
- You know what?

26:17.337 --> 26:19.370
I've been running around
for you all night, okay?

26:19.406 --> 26:20.371
I got you these girls.

26:20.407 --> 26:22.673
And you lost the suitor.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.608
You did all the small parts,

26:24.644 --> 26:26.476
but you screwed up the biggest part.

26:26.512 --> 26:29.112
Do you think that I ran
around yelling at you

26:29.148 --> 26:31.281
all of those years for fun?

26:31.316 --> 26:34.117
I set this up for you,
but you need to deliver.

26:34.153 --> 26:35.986
Okay, well, you need to let me.

26:36.022 --> 26:37.387
- Let you?
- Yes. Let me.

26:37.423 --> 26:39.722
It takes an iron spine

26:39.758 --> 26:42.225
and a steady hand to do this job.

26:42.261 --> 26:44.061
I don't know.

26:44.096 --> 26:46.863
Maybe your mother was right.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.866
What?

26:49.901 --> 26:51.401
I mean, come on.

26:51.437 --> 26:54.671
We all know you've had... episodes.

26:56.207 --> 26:57.974
You're great...

26:58.009 --> 27:00.142
until you're not.

27:00.178 --> 27:03.813
But you got a couple of
whirligigs in there, you know?

27:03.848 --> 27:06.082
Which was fine before,

27:06.117 --> 27:08.184
but not so much if you
want to be the boss.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.421
Did she call you?
Are you talking to my mother?

27:12.457 --> 27:14.823
Let's just forget it.

27:14.858 --> 27:16.392
Why don't you just get back out there

27:16.427 --> 27:18.961
and make yourself useful?

27:27.238 --> 27:28.704
Rachel?

27:28.739 --> 27:31.239
Oh, so you're smoking now?

27:31.274 --> 27:33.541
Cool.

27:33.577 --> 27:35.343
So you're just gonna become Quinn.

27:35.378 --> 27:37.278
Got it. That makes so much more sense.

27:37.314 --> 27:38.914
When can I expect the haircut?

27:38.949 --> 27:41.783
Not that you got the
cheekbones to pull it off.

27:49.426 --> 27:52.058
Jesus Christ, Rachel,
you shouldn't be here.

27:52.094 --> 27:54.628
Where'd you want me to go?

27:54.663 --> 27:57.030
Did you want me to just
quit when Quinn came back?

27:57.065 --> 27:58.965
I don't know. Maybe.

27:59.001 --> 28:00.900
I mean, that would've
been one way to say

28:00.936 --> 28:01.708
there's at least some
shit you won't eat.

28:01.732 --> 28:03.138
And what about you?

28:03.139 --> 28:04.638
I thought ' you would appreciate me

28:04.673 --> 28:06.773
trying to be at least
a tiny bit subversive.

28:06.808 --> 28:09.208
- But instead, you just completely
- Subversive? What does that even

28:09.244 --> 28:11.577
pussied out on Ruby from the beginning.

28:11.613 --> 28:14.080
Dude, you used your own
self-loathing about working here

28:14.116 --> 28:16.282
as some sort of justification
for letting her go.

28:16.317 --> 28:18.451
- It's like you are deliberately...
- Can we stop fighting, please?

28:18.486 --> 28:21.254
- Trying to sabotage me. What is it?
- I am the wrong target, Rach.

28:21.289 --> 28:23.322
Are you jealous that I got
promoted instead of you?

28:23.358 --> 28:24.557
Is that what this is about?

28:24.592 --> 28:25.991
It's not that I'm jealous of you,

28:26.027 --> 28:28.827
because I don't believe
you actually got promoted.

28:28.863 --> 28:30.763
I'm your boss.

28:30.798 --> 28:32.097
As long as Quinn's around,

28:32.133 --> 28:35.401
she's my boss, and she's your boss, too.

28:35.436 --> 28:37.670
Wake up, Rachel,

28:37.705 --> 28:39.938
because Quinn is never
leaving this place...

28:39.974 --> 28:45.277
Not until you pry "Everlasting"
out of her cold, dead hands.

28:48.215 --> 28:51.316
Hey, Rach. You all right?

28:51.351 --> 28:54.987
Cool. Uh, well, we need
to take this to set, so...

28:55.022 --> 28:57.189
Guys, hurry up. Hustle.

28:57.224 --> 28:58.590
We got to take this to set. Let's go.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.358
Okay.

29:03.990 --> 29:06.491
Thank you. You
were great. That was awesome.

29:08.896 --> 29:11.229
Psht.

29:11.265 --> 29:15.600
It's sad to watch you sully your
temple with chemicals and crap.

29:15.635 --> 29:17.735
By the way, I saw the butch little thing

29:17.771 --> 29:19.104
you had going with Tiffany.

29:19.339 --> 29:21.239
I don't know what you promised her,

29:21.275 --> 29:23.841
but I got her playing tonsil
hockey with the cousin.

29:23.877 --> 29:24.942
I intend to air it.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.481
Ahh. Then, of course,
it's bye-bye, wifey.

29:31.284 --> 29:34.252
You know, please understand
that nothing you cobble together

29:34.287 --> 29:36.187
will ever make it to air,

29:36.222 --> 29:39.090
because what America wants and
what the network knows they want

29:39.125 --> 29:40.792
is a fairy tale,

29:40.827 --> 29:43.594
and I don't care what guru,
transformational bullshit

29:43.629 --> 29:46.363
you're into now, but you are emotionally

29:46.399 --> 29:49.933
and physically incapable of
delivering that to anyone.

29:49.968 --> 29:51.268
- Come on.
- No.

29:51.304 --> 29:53.804
You need to make America feel something,

29:53.839 --> 29:55.372
and the only thing that can do that

29:55.408 --> 29:57.007
is an honest-to-God wifey

29:57.042 --> 29:58.942
- who is demure and supportive...
- Demure?

29:58.977 --> 30:01.978
And, most importantly, worthy.

30:02.014 --> 30:04.114
But unfortunately,

30:04.149 --> 30:06.382
you wouldn't know one of those
if she slapped you in the face.

30:06.418 --> 30:08.185
Maybe you should try being a wifey

30:08.220 --> 30:09.986
before you lecture me about what one is.

30:10.022 --> 30:11.688
You don't seem to be able

30:11.723 --> 30:13.323
to drag yourself across
that line, either.

30:13.358 --> 30:15.558
Do you, Quinnie?

30:15.593 --> 30:17.160
Oh, no! Yael!

30:17.196 --> 30:18.795
- Barry! Barry, get on that!
- Jeremy, got on it!

30:18.831 --> 30:20.663
- Uh, Rachel?!
- Someone, help her!

30:21.833 --> 30:23.132
Barry, are you on it?!

30:23.167 --> 30:24.867
You getting it?!

Film that! Zoom in! Zoom in!

- Barry, get on that!
- Jeremy, stay on it!

30:27.739 --> 30:29.972
It's okay.

30:30.007 --> 30:32.875
Yes! That is a fairy tale.

I'm fine, man.

31:04.641 --> 31:06.074
No. I'll take his.

remember these girls' names?

- Here. Cheat sheet.

31:17.888 --> 31:19.220
A cheat sheet.

You just get to pick
the one you want to pick.

No. I mean, the Blondie.

put herself out there

- White girls.

Lawrence all four years?

Listen, I know what it's
like to want to impress a boss

Ladies, 26 of you came here
tonight with an open heart...

32:41.301 --> 32:42.819
- Hey, editors, make sure you
- and high hopes

32:42.819 --> 32:44.070
- just cut this all up...
- for a journey of a lifetime.

32:44.071 --> 32:45.971
Make it far more interesting
than it really is.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.006
You'll share a brief moment with him

32:48.041 --> 32:48.834
- while he hands you a bracelet.
- Why don't you go and be useful?

32:48.834 --> 32:52.610
If you don't hear your name called,
it's time to say goodbye. Darius?

32:52.645 --> 32:54.712
This has truly been an
incredible night for me.

32:54.747 --> 32:56.714
I feel like the luckiest
man in the world.

- Yes!

Come on. Let's go. Walk a little faster.

33:28.014 --> 33:29.413
Give me a wifey, because this looks like

33:29.448 --> 33:31.315
a freakin' Benetton ad, all right?

33:31.350 --> 33:34.518
And I am not pinning all
my hopes on Hot Rachel.

33:34.553 --> 33:38.522
It's, uh... It's weird that
he's not picking Tiffany.

33:39.525 --> 33:41.758
Ruby.

33:41.793 --> 33:43.827
All right. Ruby.

So, just might get
my catfight after all.

33:48.734 --> 33:51.001
"I can't breathe." I need that shirt.

33:52.270 --> 33:53.436
Beth Ann? Really?

33:53.471 --> 33:55.038
They made me keep her.

33:55.073 --> 33:56.739
They make you keep me, too?

33:56.774 --> 33:59.042
No.

33:59.077 --> 34:00.876
But how am I gonna go in the locker room

34:00.912 --> 34:04.080
and face my teammates if
I cut a girl wearing that?

34:04.115 --> 34:06.949
Well, I got a lot more
where these came from.

34:06.984 --> 34:09.018
You might actually learn a thing or two.

34:09.054 --> 34:11.219
I look forward to it.

34:14.224 --> 34:15.623
All right, I got enough black girls.

34:15.659 --> 34:16.725
Give me some white girls.

My final bracelet for
this evening goes to...

Tiffany.

34:31.108 --> 34:34.141
Ha ha. Tiffany. Yes!

34:34.178 --> 34:36.545
At least we got a wifey.

34:39.014 --> 34:40.982
I knew it.

34:41.016 --> 34:43.818
You know, I don't get
picked last for anything.

34:43.853 --> 34:45.418
I'm just glad you're here.

Put those girls in coats.
Show's over, everybody.

34:55.197 --> 34:56.898
Ladies, uh, before you leave,
I'm having a party in my place.

34:56.933 --> 34:58.499
Can you shut down that party,

34:58.534 --> 35:01.102
and can you lock Graham
in his room, please?

35:38.988 --> 35:41.121
but my two bosses are
at each other's throats.

35:41.157 --> 35:42.824
- Who? Chet?
- Yeah. And Quinn.

35:42.859 --> 35:44.796
I mean, you know their
history, right, Gary?

35:44.796 --> 35:45.284
Yeah.

35:45.284 --> 35:47.896
Okay. So, it's gotten crazy
ugly between the two of them.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.366
I mean, look, I owe them my career.

35:49.366 --> 35:51.924
I love them. I do,
but I love this show even more,

35:51.924 --> 35:53.248
and I really want it to continue,

35:53.249 --> 35:54.835
and at this point, I'm
just not sure it will.

35:56.874 --> 35:59.107
Sorry.

36:00.844 --> 36:04.144
They're making two different
versions of the show,

36:04.180 --> 36:07.524
and they're leaving it up to
you to pick which one you prefer.

36:07.524 --> 36:08.758
What?

36:08.759 --> 36:12.951
And, look, I know that you just
gave Quinn this huge overall deal

36:12.951 --> 36:14.689
and Chet's always been a
big-picture kind of guy.

36:14.724 --> 36:17.147
But, Gary,
I'm really the one that has been

36:17.147 --> 36:19.687
boots-on-the-ground,
delivering story after story

36:19.687 --> 36:22.721
for you every year,
and, I mean, this year,

36:22.721 --> 36:25.116
because of me, we're actually
gonna be making history.

36:25.188 --> 36:27.077
You know, I just don't
think that we can leave it

36:27.077 --> 36:29.002
up to Chet and Quinn
to mess this up for us.

36:29.002 --> 36:29.839
I should give them a call.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.957
You should give them a call. Yeah.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.688
I already told Quinn to call
you and reach out to you,

36:34.688 --> 36:37.480
but she said there was no point,
because, you know, you and Chet,

36:37.481 --> 36:39.961
you guys are, you know, tight.
You're bros.

36:39.961 --> 36:42.778
Uh, isn't Quinn your mentor?

36:43.635 --> 36:46.511
Yeah. She was. She was.

36:46.511 --> 36:48.565
I mean, Gary,
I'm running the show this year,

36:48.565 --> 36:49.861
but with them fighting, I just...

36:50.838 --> 36:52.780
I can't produce it with them on set.

36:52.781 --> 36:56.815
You just need to send them home,
give them some time to cool off.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.233
They have trained me so well.
You are in such good hands.

36:59.233 --> 37:01.670
Trust me. I have got your back, Gary.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.856
I can do this. I'm ready.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.308
No, no, man. It's too much talking.

37:09.343 --> 37:11.275
It's like a Merchant Ivory movie.

37:11.311 --> 37:12.577
Cut to the titty shot, already.

37:12.612 --> 37:13.652
We don't have the titty shot.

37:13.763 --> 37:15.630
Well, Google it!
I don't know what to tell you.

37:15.665 --> 37:17.932
Just double cut it. Blow it up.

37:17.968 --> 37:20.068
Slow it down. Okay.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.369
I need you to make it look like

37:21.405 --> 37:23.305
there was a real moment here, okay?

37:23.340 --> 37:26.341
♪♪

37:27.410 --> 37:29.376
Ha ha! Thank you.

37:29.412 --> 37:31.445
That is how you look at a woman.

37:31.481 --> 37:34.115
It's like a damn
instruction manual over here.

37:34.150 --> 37:36.751
And let her rip. Let's see it.
The apocalypse.

37:36.786 --> 37:40.287
♪♪

38:06.849 --> 38:09.415
What in the hell are you guys doing?

38:09.451 --> 38:11.618
- Gary.
- No. I-I-I-I'm sorry, Chet.

38:11.654 --> 38:13.319
This train is off the rails.

38:13.355 --> 38:15.656
No. He's off the rails.

38:15.691 --> 38:18.124
Really, Quinn? Well, then, why
didn't you pick up the phone?

38:18.160 --> 38:20.527
Because that's what an
executive producer would do.

38:20.562 --> 38:22.355
All right? You've got women in
bikinis on the

38:22.356 --> 38:24.465
- North Pole up there!
- It was his idea!

38:24.465 --> 38:26.299
Listen to me. Listen to me!

38:26.334 --> 38:28.635
From what I hear, you've
let your personal problems

38:28.670 --> 38:29.935
get in the way of the job.

38:29.971 --> 38:31.837
Now, we need this show,

38:31.873 --> 38:34.439
and until you can get
your eye back on the ball,

38:34.475 --> 38:36.876
I'm putting someone else in charge.

38:36.911 --> 38:39.344
Uh, excuse me?

38:39.647 --> 38:42.514
Yeah. Someone who knows
how to tell a story.

38:42.550 --> 38:45.551
Someone who can give the American public

38:45.586 --> 38:50.855
what they expect every season
from this show we all love.

38:50.891 --> 38:53.158
Oh, really. And who might that be?

38:54.495 --> 38:57.329
Coleman Wasserman, come in here, please.

38:58.865 --> 39:00.799
- Come here, buddy.
- Hey, Gary.

39:01.996 --> 39:05.003
Now, if you don't know who this guy is,

39:05.038 --> 39:08.039
you should, because we have
been looking for a chance

39:08.075 --> 39:10.008
to do something with this guy for ages.

39:10.043 --> 39:12.744
Everything he does on "Blink" blows up..

39:12.779 --> 39:15.680
10 million viewers in
the first week alone.

39:15.716 --> 39:17.381
- Gary, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

39:17.417 --> 39:20.651
Blink is gonna become a
network because of this guy.

39:20.687 --> 39:23.387
Oh, come on, Gary. This
is totally unnecessary.

39:23.423 --> 39:24.755
Do you have any idea how much money

39:24.790 --> 39:26.524
I've made for you over the years, huh?!

39:26.559 --> 39:29.560
No, no. What you've made,
Chet, is a well-oiled machine

39:29.596 --> 39:32.162
that needs someone strong at the helm.

39:32.198 --> 39:34.998
Look, either you get on
board, buddy, or you go home,

39:35.034 --> 39:38.202
because he is the one in charge now.

39:38.238 --> 39:40.303
All right? I leave it with you.

39:42.975 --> 39:44.541
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

39:44.576 --> 39:45.909
Look, I'm excited to get to work here.

39:45.945 --> 39:47.244
Hey. Hey. Uh, Chet.

39:47.279 --> 39:48.612
One second.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.680
Look, I see what you're both going for.

39:50.716 --> 39:52.382
There's merit in both versions.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.084
For now, I think I want to
lean into what Chet's doing.

39:55.487 --> 39:56.953
Thanks, man.

39:56.988 --> 39:58.788
"EverBlasting."

39:58.823 --> 40:00.189
Okay. Yeah.

40:00.225 --> 40:02.392
Whatever that is. Can't wait.

40:02.427 --> 40:04.127
- We'll talk.
- Yeah.

40:04.162 --> 40:05.895
All right.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.764
So nice to meet you.

40:07.799 --> 40:10.767
- Madison.
- Madison.

40:12.137 --> 40:13.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:13.838 --> 40:15.704
I actually know who you are.

40:15.740 --> 40:19.275
I saw that displaced Cambodian
sex worker series you did.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.643
- It was very good.
- You just Googled that.

40:20.678 --> 40:22.245
No. I didn't.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.313
Believe it or not, I am
interested in a lot more

40:24.348 --> 40:25.381
than just "Everlasting."

40:25.416 --> 40:27.416
Oh, I believe it.

40:27.451 --> 40:29.652
I know who you are, too.

40:29.687 --> 40:32.921
Gary said you and
Quinn make a great team.

40:32.956 --> 40:34.390
Well, you know, we've
been working together

40:34.425 --> 40:37.760
for a long time, so... yeah.

40:37.795 --> 40:39.461
I'm guessing she doesn't know

40:39.497 --> 40:41.730
that you're the one
who complained to the network

40:41.766 --> 40:43.064
and brought me here.

40:43.100 --> 40:44.733
Phew!

40:44.769 --> 40:47.302
I got to say that's a baller move.

40:47.337 --> 40:49.704
Sounds like something I would've done.

40:51.816 --> 40:54.107
But didn't exactly work out

40:54.107 --> 40:56.139
the way you wanted
it to, though, did it?

40:56.139 --> 40:58.413
'Cause instead you got me.

41:02.519 --> 41:04.885
This is gonna be fun.

41:08.825 --> 41:10.191
See ya.
