00:00.893 --> 00:03.961
In Los Angeles, lives a
girl <i>named Kirsten Clark.</i>

00:03.985 --> 00:06.020
<i>Kirsten has a very particular gift.</i>

00:06.054 --> 00:10.090
Cameron: <i>That gift is more of a
curse. Kirsten has no sense of time.</i>

00:10.115 --> 00:11.582
Are those brains?

00:11.607 --> 00:14.275
Camille: <i>Or humor. Basically,
the worst roommate ever.</i>

00:14.310 --> 00:16.616
Linus: <i>Because of her condition,
Kirsten lives in a state</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:18.179
<i>of perpetual deja vu.</i>

00:18.214 --> 00:20.376
Maggie: <i>One day, Kirsten
met a woman named Maggie,</i>

00:20.401 --> 00:23.455
<i>who recruited her for a
secret government program.</i>

00:23.480 --> 00:26.148
<i>We do something there called stitching.</i>

00:26.173 --> 00:29.690
<i>We take a living consciousness and
shove it into someone else's brain.</i>

00:29.715 --> 00:32.205
Linus: <i>A dead someone else's dead brain.</i>

00:32.229 --> 00:34.554
Cameron: <i>Once inside, we
hack the person's memories</i>

00:34.579 --> 00:36.382
<i>to learn how he or she died,</i>

00:36.407 --> 00:38.608
<i>and it's always pretty horrible.</i>

00:38.646 --> 00:40.660
Maggie: <i>We give the dead back their voice,</i>

00:40.685 --> 00:44.216
<i>and in the process, we solve
some very serious crimes.</i>

00:44.241 --> 00:46.409
<i>Kirsten's the perfect stitcher.</i>

00:46.434 --> 00:49.329
Cameron: <i>But she's got a ton of
dark secrets from her own past,</i>

00:49.354 --> 00:51.593
<i>many of which even she doesn't know.</i>

00:51.618 --> 00:53.619
Linus: <i>Which is actually kind of ironic... </i>

00:53.645 --> 00:56.714
Camille: <i>Because for a girl who
lives in the memories of the dead... </i>

00:56.739 --> 01:01.576
Cameron: <i>Kirsten sure has a lot of ghosts.</i>

01:15.809 --> 01:18.206
Camille?

01:38.595 --> 01:42.034
New boyfriend, Camille? Nice try.

01:42.059 --> 01:45.090
Unbelievable.

01:45.115 --> 01:48.827
I thought plunging you into total darkness
would put you over the top this time.

01:48.852 --> 01:51.070
I told you. I don't do scared.

01:51.095 --> 01:53.770
You let me down, Zed.

02:01.418 --> 02:04.878
I can't wait till this
place gets back to normal.

02:04.903 --> 02:08.949
You mean boring. Seriously,
you investigate murders

02:08.973 --> 02:11.630
by poking around the
memories of dead people.

02:11.655 --> 02:14.970
How can you not love Halloween?

02:15.715 --> 02:17.646
That reminds me. I'm hungry.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.521
You're gonna be the life
of my Halloween party.

02:19.546 --> 02:21.034
At least you invited me this year.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.960
I didn't like you last year.

02:25.948 --> 02:28.546
What? Not me.

02:32.869 --> 02:36.948
Huh? What do you think?

02:36.972 --> 02:39.372
Dead on. Am I right?

02:39.397 --> 02:40.627
You're two days early.

02:40.652 --> 02:42.563
I'm just trying stuff out.

02:42.588 --> 02:44.971
A cow? Really?

02:44.996 --> 02:46.507
These babies work.

02:47.311 --> 02:50.675
- Give 'em a yank.
- Now, that's scary.

03:00.111 --> 03:02.731
You will find another place for your party.

03:02.756 --> 03:05.357
Well, you know, I was
actually kind of thinking...

03:05.382 --> 03:06.849
No, you can't use our house.

03:06.874 --> 03:08.173
Yeah, you're right. It's too small.

03:08.198 --> 03:09.492
It's not scary enough, even with you in it.

03:09.517 --> 03:11.162
Who left this in the break room?

03:11.187 --> 03:12.754
- That would be me.
- Breakfast of champions?

03:12.779 --> 03:15.080
- Hardly.
- What do you have against corn?

03:15.105 --> 03:17.821
Corn on the cob? Nothing.
Corn tortillas? Bring it.

03:17.845 --> 03:20.599
Popcorn, corn chowder, corn
muffins? I'm all over that.

03:20.624 --> 03:24.120
But pretend corn trying to be corn? Pass.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.380
Read the first ingredient.

03:27.405 --> 03:30.295
- "Corn syrup."
- Thank you.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.023
- So, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

03:33.048 --> 03:36.078
Camille lost the venue for her
big Halloween bash tomorrow night.

03:36.103 --> 03:37.522
"Nightmare on Camille street"?

03:37.547 --> 03:40.323
Yeah, you know the big spooky
house I always use on Coronado?

03:40.348 --> 03:44.045
Well, it's being torn down to make
way for, ironically, a mortuary.

03:44.069 --> 03:48.917
Speaking of irony, a new sample.

03:51.342 --> 03:55.331
Devon Landry. Age 20. A
student at archer university.

03:55.356 --> 03:58.471
He was found hanging from a
tree near his home. Suicide.

03:58.496 --> 04:01.411
- He left behind a note saying he was sorry for what he did.
- Which was?

04:01.436 --> 04:05.692
We think that he's connected to
the disappearance of Kelli Marino.

04:05.717 --> 04:08.392
She was a student at archer university

04:08.417 --> 04:10.610
and worked at a diner near campus.

04:10.635 --> 04:12.169
Went missing two days ago.

04:12.194 --> 04:13.657
Oh, I saw that on the news.

04:13.682 --> 04:15.535
She and Devon shared
several classes together,

04:15.560 --> 04:17.565
and given his remorseful suicide note...

04:17.589 --> 04:19.885
- He may have abducted her?
- Or worse.

04:19.910 --> 04:22.277
Maggie: The police have
already searched Devon's house.

04:22.302 --> 04:25.083
He's been living alone since his
parents died a few years ago.

04:25.108 --> 04:26.845
Because that's not creepy at all.

04:26.870 --> 04:29.988
We need to find out if he is
responsible for Kelli's disappearance,

04:30.013 --> 04:33.637
and with any luck, where
we can find her, alive.

04:33.662 --> 04:36.797
Missing girl, possibly murdered.

04:36.822 --> 04:39.058
Happy Halloween.

Okay, then. Induce stitch

05:21.064 --> 05:25.213

05:25.237 --> 05:27.276
And mark.

05:30.502 --> 05:33.356
I'm at a diner.

05:34.411 --> 05:36.311
Devon's watching Kelli.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.874
Just watching her?

05:40.378 --> 05:41.645
Would you like anything else?

05:41.670 --> 05:45.063
No, no, I'm good.

05:45.088 --> 05:47.616
Just get me when you're ready.

05:47.641 --> 05:52.903
Hey, that, uh, that lab test

05:52.928 --> 05:54.658
the other day was pretty hard, huh?

05:54.683 --> 05:58.285
I think he likes her, but he's
kind of awkward around her.

05:58.310 --> 06:00.750
Cameron, you can relate to that.

06:04.433 --> 06:08.405
- We're in the same class.
- Oh, we are?

06:08.430 --> 06:11.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that lab was killer.

06:11.975 --> 06:16.252
Yeah, I...

06:22.345 --> 06:25.113
Oh, here.

06:25.138 --> 06:28.638
Okay, then.

06:31.554 --> 06:35.675
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you too.

06:40.514 --> 06:44.444
I'm not sure where I am now,

06:44.469 --> 06:46.404
but Devon's with a dead body.

06:46.429 --> 06:47.858
Oh, God!

06:48.368 --> 06:50.740
Is it Kelli?

06:57.137 --> 06:59.827
I don't know. I'm someplace else.

07:00.935 --> 07:05.427
I... I think it's Devon's bedroom.

07:06.479 --> 07:10.115
Why do you do bad things?

07:10.140 --> 07:12.175
He's talking to himself.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.059
You need to stop.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.547
Just leave her alone.

07:18.376 --> 07:20.769
I'm ping ponging all over the place.

07:20.795 --> 07:23.554
I'm back at the diner.

07:26.475 --> 07:28.681
Kelli's locking up.

07:31.924 --> 07:35.763
- Devon's watching her again.
- Is there anyone else around?

07:35.788 --> 07:37.811
- Any witnesses?
- No.

07:39.039 --> 07:43.106
Don't you try and stop me!

07:48.404 --> 07:50.547
I'm bouncing!

07:52.922 --> 07:54.126
_

07:54.151 --> 07:57.623
You still had time. Why did you bounce?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.841
Devon looked at me and talked to me.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.351
Wait a second.

08:02.377 --> 08:05.499
That dead guy talked to you, in his memory?

08:05.524 --> 08:08.252
Yeah, yeah, he said that I
shouldn't try to stop him.

08:08.277 --> 08:09.343
And then, he grabbed Kelli.

08:09.368 --> 08:12.916
Everyone who's freaked out, say "me." Me!

08:12.941 --> 08:14.815
It was a phantasmic memory anomaly.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.659
Yes, it's a PMA. Of course.

08:16.684 --> 08:18.659
Now, in "human," please.

08:18.684 --> 08:20.715
A phantom memory. A distortion.

08:20.740 --> 08:22.328
What you saw didn't really happen.

08:22.353 --> 08:24.454
He was thinking that thought,
and then, in his mind,

08:24.479 --> 08:26.463
it got encoded as a
direct comment to himself.

08:26.488 --> 08:29.529
- Cameron: But it appears as if you saw him.
- Maybe.

08:29.554 --> 08:32.157
Okay, focus, people. You
said that he grabbed her.

08:32.182 --> 08:33.710
Could you tell if he killed her?

08:33.735 --> 08:35.937
No.

08:35.962 --> 08:38.697
- The body you saw in the room?
- I don't know if it was Kelli's.

08:38.722 --> 08:40.282
I couldn't even tell where it was.

08:40.307 --> 08:43.465
- Devon's house?
- The police were all over that. They didn't find anything.

08:43.491 --> 08:44.795
Well, maybe they missed something.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.678
I'll call Fisher and get a copy of
the report from the first responders.

08:47.703 --> 08:51.171
In the meantime, go check it out.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.512
- Linus: Wow!
- Holy crapenstein.

09:04.537 --> 09:06.772
Cameron: Talk about your good,
old-fashioned nightmare fuel.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.666
Talk about the perfect place
for my Halloween party.

09:09.691 --> 09:11.625
Oh, seriously? We have a job to do.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.517
As do I. Look, according to public records,

09:13.542 --> 09:16.693
the place is completely paid
off and freshly ownerless.

09:16.718 --> 09:18.452
As soon as Devon's death becomes public,

09:18.477 --> 09:20.295
the whole kit and kaboodle will
be grabbed up by the state.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.151
- Okay, so?
- So, it's available.

09:23.176 --> 09:26.772
Cameron: A girl is missing. You can't
throw a party where her kidnapper lived.

09:26.797 --> 09:29.499
- Because?
- Because it's wrong on every level.

09:29.524 --> 09:32.101
I think there's a gray area
where it's a wee bit right.

09:32.126 --> 09:34.132
Does anything you see out here,
match what you saw in the stitch?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.668
No.

09:39.321 --> 09:42.232
Um, there's someone in the house.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.646
I didn't see anything.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.280
I did.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.346
Hello?

10:01.672 --> 10:05.342
Did it strike anyone else as
odd that the door was unlocked?

10:05.367 --> 10:06.695
Should we be worried?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.283
Answer the second question first.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.976
Kirsten, the cops already
searched the place.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.307
I saw someone upstairs.

10:12.332 --> 10:14.823
And she's going upstairs.

10:15.706 --> 10:17.581
Bro, this place give you the creeps?

10:17.606 --> 10:19.452
Yeah, it would creep me out
even if it wasn't the domain

10:19.477 --> 10:22.350
of a kidnapper and possible killer.

10:31.634 --> 10:33.645
Hello?

10:45.106 --> 10:47.273
Hello?

10:47.332 --> 10:50.470
Okay, the punch bowl goes there.
Zed the zombie's out there...

10:50.495 --> 10:52.502
Still wrong. We'll check the basement.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.860
- For what?
- Bodies.

10:53.885 --> 10:55.919
Why don't you go check out the basement?

10:55.944 --> 10:59.880
Yeah, why don't you go check out what is
probably the most awful basement in the universe?

10:59.905 --> 11:01.640
I would,

11:01.665 --> 11:05.453
but I've gotta go upstairs.

11:12.363 --> 11:15.131
This is so perfect.

11:32.618 --> 11:34.485
I thought I saw someone.

11:34.510 --> 11:38.142
- It was just the curtain.
- Yeah, I guess.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.215
You coming?

11:40.795 --> 11:42.477
Do you feel that?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.908
Feel what?

11:43.933 --> 11:47.502
Like a... presence.

11:47.527 --> 11:50.375
Wh-what kind of presence?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.662
The watching kind.

11:52.687 --> 11:54.830
So, I checked downstairs.

11:54.855 --> 11:59.346
There was nobody there. Get it? "No body."

11:59.724 --> 12:02.515
Come on, these are the jokes, people.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.674
No one's up here.

12:03.699 --> 12:05.306
So, the house is empty.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.545
She doesn't look convinced.

12:08.570 --> 12:11.561
She feels a presence.

12:11.586 --> 12:13.320
I thought you don't do scared.

12:13.345 --> 12:15.746
I don't. I'm doing intrigued.

12:15.771 --> 12:19.169
And on that note...

12:53.824 --> 12:58.161
I don't get it. Devon's online
profile. He doesn't seem like a killer.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.095
He did well in school.
He never got in trouble.

13:00.129 --> 13:04.168
He kept to himself,
doesn't have many friends.

13:04.193 --> 13:07.429
Sounds like a leggy blonde I
know. Care for an "eye d'oeuvre"?

13:07.463 --> 13:09.867
- Eye d'oeuvre?
- Yeah, they're for the party.

13:09.892 --> 13:11.901
It's mozzarella, a little black olive,

13:11.936 --> 13:15.531
and a touch of food coloring
for that creepy, bloodshot look.

13:15.556 --> 13:17.840
Are you seriously going
ahead with the party?

13:17.873 --> 13:21.819
Uh, funny story. I may have accidentally

13:21.846 --> 13:23.713
told a couple of people
about finding Devon's house,

13:23.748 --> 13:25.112
and then, one of them

13:25.137 --> 13:29.012
may have group chatted the address.

13:29.037 --> 13:31.015
Come on, it'll be fine.
It's just one night.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.176
And besides, the whole place is in
limbo until the state claims it.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.021
What's the worst that could happen?

13:37.046 --> 13:40.015
Hi, Linus. Did you know that
Camille's going ahead with the party?

13:40.049 --> 13:43.085
Yeah. We're actually heading out right now
to pick up some more Halloween decorations.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.307
I know a guy who owns a prop house.

13:44.332 --> 13:46.172
He's letting us borrow a coffin.

13:46.197 --> 13:47.840
Are you seriously going along with this?

13:47.865 --> 13:50.213
- Look, I know the whole house thing's a little weird.
- Yeah.

13:50.238 --> 13:52.280
But it is a party, right?

13:53.148 --> 13:56.096
- Are these eye d'oeuvres?
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.433 --> 13:59.711
Mmm. Mmm. You got nachos?

13:59.736 --> 14:01.823
I only have eyes for you.

14:01.848 --> 14:04.687
Anyways, we should get going. My friend
said he'll kill me if we're late.

14:04.712 --> 14:07.330
Well, if he does, we can break
in that coffin. Later, roomie.

14:07.355 --> 14:08.956
See ya.

15:23.051 --> 15:25.622
Who's there?

16:13.160 --> 16:16.883
I know you have no concept of time, but
do you have any idea what time it is?

16:16.908 --> 16:18.149
Devon was at my house.

16:18.174 --> 16:19.871
- Kirsten...
- No, I'm serious.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.699
He was outside, he staring at me,

16:21.724 --> 16:24.092
and then, he was gone like a ghost.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.711
A ghost?

16:25.736 --> 16:29.142
I know. I know. It's
ridiculous. Devon's dead.

16:29.391 --> 16:32.823
Have you got any chocolate hazelnut spread?

16:32.848 --> 16:34.550
Excuse me?

16:34.575 --> 16:38.097
Chocolate hazelnut
spread. It calms me down.

16:44.828 --> 16:47.307
There's a tidbit of information
I never knew about you.

16:47.332 --> 16:49.267
Look, I know there's no
such thing as ghosts, but...

16:49.301 --> 16:51.806
Well, for you, there are, kind of.

16:51.831 --> 16:56.014
When you're in someone's memory, you're
basically looking at images that linger.

16:57.849 --> 17:00.120
But I wasn't in the stitch. I was at home.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.902
Things have a way of sticking
to your subconscious.

17:02.928 --> 17:05.063
Milk.

17:05.243 --> 17:07.223
That calm you down, too?

17:07.248 --> 17:09.415
No. Goes with the chocolate.

17:09.892 --> 17:12.126
Here.

17:12.151 --> 17:15.630
I'll get you a...

17:17.420 --> 17:22.310
Glass. Should I be worried about you?

17:22.799 --> 17:25.942
No. No, I'm fine.

17:26.907 --> 17:28.875
I just need to sleep.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.511
Enjoy the couch. I'll
see you in the morning.

17:38.984 --> 17:41.180
All right, let's get this over with.

17:47.224 --> 17:51.090
Aren't you going to call a
go, no-go for the stitch?

18:09.841 --> 18:14.287
Uh, Cameron, something's wrong.

18:17.873 --> 18:19.772
Cameron.

18:19.797 --> 18:22.432
We're losing water.

18:22.457 --> 18:25.795
Camille, Linus!

18:25.820 --> 18:28.315
Guys, do you see what's happening?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.995
What's going on? Guys.

18:36.627 --> 18:38.683
Cameron!

18:38.708 --> 18:40.675
Cameron!

18:40.700 --> 18:43.518
Stop the stitch! Cameron!

18:43.543 --> 18:45.310
No!

18:45.335 --> 18:46.603
No!

18:46.627 --> 18:48.242
Cameron!

18:48.268 --> 18:51.811
Cameron, stop the stitch! Cameron!

18:57.818 --> 19:00.322
Oh, God.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.925
Cameron, stop the stitch!

20:27.169 --> 20:30.105
Oh!

20:30.130 --> 20:32.636
He's out there. He's out there.

20:32.661 --> 20:36.917
- Who?
- Devon. Look. Look. Come on.

20:37.435 --> 20:42.069
Devon's out there. Don't.

20:45.396 --> 20:48.238
- No one's out here.
- He was. I just saw him.

20:48.263 --> 20:50.958
Okay, how about we put
the knife away, Jason?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.606
I just saw him.

20:52.630 --> 20:55.951
Kirsten, this is just work-induced stress.

20:55.976 --> 20:57.237
But why this case?

20:57.262 --> 20:59.198
Everyone has got their limits.

20:59.223 --> 21:00.725
No, no, I don't.

21:00.750 --> 21:04.810
Okay, just give me... Hand me the knife.

21:04.835 --> 21:07.067
Okay. Oh, my God, you're shaking.

21:07.092 --> 21:11.128
Okay, just take some deep
breaths. Try to relax.

21:11.372 --> 21:14.308
- Okay.
- You don't do scared, remember?

21:14.333 --> 21:16.526
- Okay.
- Okay, you're safe.

21:16.551 --> 21:20.122
You're safe. Devon's dead.
Nothing is going to happen to you.

21:20.147 --> 21:22.882
So, what do you say you go
back to bed and get some sleep?

21:22.907 --> 21:25.262
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:38.502 --> 21:42.291
Okay, you all good?

21:43.632 --> 21:45.867
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

21:45.892 --> 21:48.468
Wait.

21:49.962 --> 21:52.465
Stay with me?

21:52.854 --> 21:54.938
Sure.

22:44.807 --> 22:46.775
Hey, Fisher.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.102
<i>Just heard Devon Landry worked
as a temp at archer's med school</i>

22:50.127 --> 22:51.827
<i>in the cadaver lab.</i>

22:51.852 --> 22:53.642
That's what I get to wake up to?

22:53.667 --> 22:57.283
<i>I'm sorry. Good morning! Sleep well?</i>

22:57.308 --> 23:00.098
<i>Devon Landry worked as a
temp in the cadaver lab.</i>

23:00.123 --> 23:03.994
Much better. It could be why
Kirsten saw a body in the stitch.

23:04.019 --> 23:06.603
<i>Maybe she'll connect with
something that'll lead us to Kelli.</i>

23:06.628 --> 23:09.155
<i>See if you can find
Kirsten and meet me there.</i>

23:09.180 --> 23:13.267
Yeah, I'll see if I can find her.

23:24.632 --> 23:26.112
You okay?

23:26.137 --> 23:27.729
She's a little rattled by this case.

23:27.754 --> 23:30.370
No, I'm not. I didn't
sleep well last night.

23:30.395 --> 23:32.897
- You snore.
- No, I don't.

23:32.922 --> 23:34.744
Are you guys... ?

23:34.770 --> 23:37.857
You know what? T.M.I.

23:37.882 --> 23:40.445
- We're not.
- Let's just do this.

23:40.470 --> 23:43.431
- Look familiar?
- Yeah, this kind of does.

23:45.893 --> 23:47.942
- You may want to look away.
- Seriously?

23:47.967 --> 23:50.068
He's right. You don't
know what's under here.

23:50.093 --> 23:51.994
I work with the dead every single day.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.077
Don't say we didn't warn you.

23:54.102 --> 23:55.966
Holy crapenstein.

23:55.991 --> 23:57.837
Ugh. His organs are missing.

23:57.862 --> 23:59.385
Yeah, that's what happens
with medical school cadavers.

23:59.410 --> 24:00.938
- You okay, boys?
- Yup, fine.

24:00.963 --> 24:02.559
Clearly, it isn't Kelli.

24:02.584 --> 24:04.860
Wait. Wait. What's that?

24:04.885 --> 24:07.416
What?

24:10.108 --> 24:13.634
Oh, no, please don't.

24:18.844 --> 24:23.704
- Ugh.
- Tonight, it's my turn to have the nightmares.

24:27.621 --> 24:30.214
It's Kelli's phone. I saw it in the stitch.

24:30.239 --> 24:34.663
So, he placed it there for someone
to find, and then, offs himself? Why?

24:34.688 --> 24:36.937
We're not dealing with a rational person.

24:36.962 --> 24:40.827
Oh, my God.

24:42.921 --> 24:45.144
Talk to me, people. I need
to know where Kelli is

24:45.169 --> 24:48.438
and if she's still alive.
Where are Linus and Camille?

24:48.463 --> 24:51.724
Sorry. I'm sorry. Zed's
rotator cuff was all jammed up,

24:51.749 --> 24:52.847
and then, there was Linus' driving.

24:52.887 --> 24:54.593
Zed?

24:54.618 --> 24:57.041
We'll explain later. And there's
nothing wrong with my driving.

24:57.066 --> 24:59.695
Yeah, anyway, while Linus was
busy driving like my grandmother,

24:59.720 --> 25:01.754
I ran the photogrammetry on the picture.

25:01.779 --> 25:04.015
- Kelli is in...
- a small room with cement walls.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.776
- Yes, but did you notice...
- the walls are covered with plastic. Yeah, we did.

25:07.801 --> 25:11.114
- No windows and the seams are...
- Sealed, so they're airtight.

25:11.139 --> 25:13.800
Let me talk. Thank you so much.

25:13.825 --> 25:16.827
Based on Kelli and
Devon's height and weight

25:16.852 --> 25:18.886
and per the visibility and
spectral analysis I ran,

25:18.911 --> 25:21.196
Kelli is in a space that
is 7 by 8 by 10 feet.

25:21.221 --> 25:24.590
- When was the selfie taken?
- Her phone said 6:13 A.M., two days ago.

25:24.615 --> 25:29.278
So, she's been sealed for
54 hours and 47 minutes.

25:29.303 --> 25:31.404
So, doing the math, if
Kelli is still alive,

25:31.429 --> 25:34.639
carbon dioxide will kill
her in approximately...

25:34.664 --> 25:37.290
124 minutes.

25:41.631 --> 25:44.883
Kelly doesn't have much time.
Where's that picture taken?

25:44.917 --> 25:48.787
The geotag location function on her phone
was disabled. It could have been anywhere.

25:48.812 --> 25:50.660
- Could it have been in Australia?
- What?

25:50.685 --> 25:52.200
Of course not. What's your point?

25:52.225 --> 25:54.192
My point is that it can't be anywhere.

25:54.227 --> 25:57.140
It has to be somewhere within
certain geographic parameters.

25:57.165 --> 26:00.708
Did you guys know that the term
"selfie" was invented by an Australian?

26:00.733 --> 26:04.652
And did you know that the term "who cares?"
Was invented to describe this conversation?

26:04.677 --> 26:07.096
Quiet. Time of death on Devon was 9:00 A.M.

26:07.121 --> 26:09.561
That's 2 hours and 47 minutes

26:09.586 --> 26:11.135
after he took the selfie with Kelli.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.655
We know he went to a cadaver lab

26:12.689 --> 26:14.423
because he left her phone in a cadaver.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.290
Okay, so let's say he spent no more
than ten minutes at the morgue,

26:17.315 --> 26:19.045
and it takes another ten minutes

26:19.070 --> 26:20.259
to get to and from the office in his car.

26:20.284 --> 26:22.574
How close is the lab to his house?

26:22.599 --> 26:25.302
At that time of day, the drive
home took Devon 33 minutes.

26:25.327 --> 26:27.441
Let's give him another six minutes
to write the suicide letter,

26:27.466 --> 26:30.302
twenty minutes to rig the ropes
and find just the right tree.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.484
That leaves 88 minutes of
Devon's time unaccounted for,

26:32.509 --> 26:36.219
which means Kelli is no further than
that in any direction from his house.

26:36.244 --> 26:38.124
We don't have time to run a grid search.

26:38.149 --> 26:40.932
But we do have time to stitch.

26:44.934 --> 26:48.351
- We need to talk.
- No, we need to stitch, now.

26:48.376 --> 26:50.077
That's what we need to talk about.

26:50.102 --> 26:52.303
Are you sure that you're
emotionally ready for this?

26:52.328 --> 26:54.518
Cameron told you I'm seeing things.

26:54.543 --> 26:57.063
Devon's ghost, to be exact.

26:57.088 --> 26:59.465
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

27:00.322 --> 27:04.091
- Linus?
- There's 97 minutes of air left.

27:04.116 --> 27:06.998
So, we can talk or we can
save Kelli. Your call.

27:09.578 --> 27:11.293
Cameron, let 'er rip.

27:11.318 --> 27:13.739
- Com check, Kirsten.
- I'm with you.

27:13.764 --> 27:16.038
Okay, Kelli. Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

27:16.063 --> 27:17.978
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark,

27:18.003 --> 27:21.774
in three, two, one, mark.

27:24.620 --> 27:28.264
I'm in Devon's house.

27:33.464 --> 27:37.118
He hears something downstairs.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.471
I'm in the basement.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.319
What's Devon doing?

27:45.343 --> 27:47.421
I don't see him.

27:54.876 --> 27:58.674
I see him now.

28:00.096 --> 28:05.530
I can hear Kelli screaming,
but I don't know where she...

28:08.200 --> 28:12.010
You're next.

28:12.787 --> 28:14.850
I'm bouncing.

28:15.963 --> 28:18.451
Call Fisher. Kelli's in the basement.

28:29.741 --> 28:33.007
Help me. She's behind here.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.835
Kirsten: Kelli.

28:47.836 --> 28:50.779
- Is she... ?
- Still breathing.

28:50.804 --> 28:52.747
Kelli, wake up.

28:53.847 --> 28:56.234
Kelli, wake up.

28:59.961 --> 29:03.492
- Okay.
- Please stay with us.

29:03.517 --> 29:07.138
Kelli, please, open your
eyes, open your eyes.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.977
Open your eyes.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.117
Kelli, Kelli.

29:14.142 --> 29:17.812
It's okay. We're here to save you.

29:17.987 --> 29:20.655
It's okay.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.319
Who are you?

29:22.344 --> 29:24.816
I'm Kirsten. You're safe now.

29:24.841 --> 29:26.915
It's okay.

29:26.940 --> 29:30.875
It's okay. You're safe now.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.746
Okay.

29:47.109 --> 29:49.855
Kelli's dehydrated. A couple
minor scrapes and bruises,

29:49.880 --> 29:51.420
but she's going to be okay.

29:51.445 --> 29:52.467
Physically.

29:52.752 --> 29:55.152
Victim services is gonna
meet her at the hospital.

29:55.177 --> 29:57.352
Do you need our statements about
Devon Landry kidnapping her?

29:57.378 --> 30:00.169
Uh, let's keep you guys off the grid.

30:00.194 --> 30:04.339
If it weren't for you, she
would've died. You saved her life.

30:04.364 --> 30:06.937
It's basically what we do for a living.

30:10.071 --> 30:11.989
Well done.

30:12.014 --> 30:14.149
Maybe now that we've put
Devon's ghost to bed,

30:14.174 --> 30:15.374
you can get a decent night's sleep.

30:15.399 --> 30:17.169
Yeah.

30:17.194 --> 30:19.929
- Well, I guess we should all go home.
- Camille: Why?

30:19.954 --> 30:23.056
It is Halloween.

30:24.415 --> 30:28.494
Come on. I got stuff to do. Let's go.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.374
How did you pull this off in one day?

31:03.399 --> 31:05.589
I know people, baby. I
just made a few calls.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.698
This party is epic.

31:07.723 --> 31:09.896
Yeah, and also highly inappropriate.

31:09.921 --> 31:12.771
Oh, shut up and drink
your morgue-arita already.

31:12.796 --> 31:14.197
Everyone is having a blast.

31:14.222 --> 31:16.808
Did you guys know that Halloween
started as a Gaelic celebration

31:16.833 --> 31:18.307
at the end of the harvest season?

31:18.332 --> 31:21.593
No one likes a know-it-all, Linus.
What are you even supposed to be?

31:21.618 --> 31:25.051
I'm an intergalactic rock star.

31:25.076 --> 31:28.305
- It looks like your mother did your make-up.
- Your point?

31:28.330 --> 31:32.057
Anyway, Halloween is about a lot of things,

31:32.083 --> 31:35.152
but tonight, it's about not
letting your fears get to you.

31:35.177 --> 31:37.970
Scantily-clad vampire
space princess is right.

31:37.995 --> 31:40.676
It's just "vampire space princess."

31:40.701 --> 31:43.456
Let's make some magic happen at this party.

31:44.010 --> 31:46.211
Ah!

31:46.584 --> 31:51.215
Oh, my God. A pregnant zombie!
That is so oddly intriguing.

31:51.239 --> 31:53.656
Let's go get our picture with her.

31:55.601 --> 31:58.707
You've got pixie dust on you.

31:58.732 --> 32:01.297
- And in my eye. Great.
- Wait. I...

32:04.157 --> 32:06.530
You look like an angel.

32:06.555 --> 32:09.032
You look like a hero.

32:09.710 --> 32:13.072
No, but, seriously, thank you for helping
me through the last couple of days.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.199
Well, that's what heroes do.
Then again, you would know.

32:16.224 --> 32:17.777
Kelli is alive because of you.

32:17.802 --> 32:20.114
- Because of us.
- Okay, fine.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.920
We should start a crime-fighting team.

32:22.945 --> 32:24.162
Excellent idea.

32:24.187 --> 32:26.625
Okay, well, what should
our superhero names be?

32:26.650 --> 32:30.216
You could be Captain Big Hair.

32:30.241 --> 32:31.352
Really?

32:31.775 --> 32:34.360
Making the world safe for mousses and gels,

32:34.385 --> 32:36.922
it's Captain Big Hair!

32:36.947 --> 32:40.392
Okay, fine. You can be Deathstare.

32:40.417 --> 32:44.420
Deathstare? Seriously? Like,
that's my superhero name?

32:44.445 --> 32:46.911
There it is.

32:48.558 --> 32:52.112
You, um... You wanna dance?

32:52.137 --> 32:53.938
Sure.

32:53.963 --> 32:55.719
Just let me get the pixie
dust out of my eyes.

32:55.744 --> 32:57.796
But the line for the bathroom's nuts.

32:57.821 --> 33:00.438
Yeah, I think I saw one upstairs.

33:00.597 --> 33:03.449
I'll be waiting for that dance.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.835
Hello?

33:35.994 --> 33:39.690
Why do you do bad things?

33:41.698 --> 33:44.522
Where's the mirror?

34:08.504 --> 34:12.407
Why are you here? Why did you
bring these people to my house?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.264
Don't you try and stop me.

34:17.547 --> 34:19.514
Why do you do bad things?

34:19.540 --> 34:21.828
You're my ghost.

34:21.853 --> 34:25.108
No, I'm your nightmare.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.980
Cameron! Cameron!

34:40.645 --> 34:43.906
Where's Kirsten already? I
got her a monster mash-tini.

34:43.931 --> 34:45.965
- Seriously, who comes up with these names?
- I do.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.610
Space princess doesn't think
I have Halloween spirit.

34:48.636 --> 34:52.594
The space princess doesn't
like the space rock star.

34:52.619 --> 34:56.724
Okay, I'm a space
princess, but I have fangs.

34:56.748 --> 35:01.750
You're not scary. Neither of
you are embracing the essence

35:01.775 --> 35:04.532
of what makes Halloween so awesome.

35:04.557 --> 35:06.936
There's an evil twin
upstairs in a secret room!

35:10.010 --> 35:13.405
Ha! That's what I'm talking about!

35:16.621 --> 35:19.823
No, I'm not kidding.

35:19.848 --> 35:22.144
- Devon has a twin brother. He's here.
- What?

35:22.169 --> 35:25.004
He's the one that kidnapped
Kelli and killed Devon.

35:25.652 --> 35:28.875
We have to clear everybody out. Clear
everyone out right now. Right now.

35:28.900 --> 35:32.331
Excuse me. Excuse me. Everybody
out! The party's over.

35:32.356 --> 35:33.810
Seriously, party's over!

35:33.835 --> 35:37.067
Oh, for the love of... Excuse me.

35:37.735 --> 35:42.406
You guys, Stephen king's outside
and he's signing autographs!

35:42.431 --> 35:44.923
Go ahead. Don't miss it.

35:47.868 --> 35:51.332
We'll see you next year. It was fantastic.

35:55.769 --> 35:58.704
- Okay, Fisher's on his way.
- Okay, good.

35:59.046 --> 36:01.474
- Where's Camille?
- I didn't see her leave.

36:01.499 --> 36:03.269
Me neither.

36:03.293 --> 36:06.339
- Damn it.
- Camille?

36:06.364 --> 36:09.510
Camille!

36:11.963 --> 36:14.591
Cameron: Kirsten, wait!

36:16.406 --> 36:18.484
Camille!

36:18.509 --> 36:20.376
Phones!

36:34.162 --> 36:36.874
This wasn't here before.

36:40.369 --> 36:42.440
Kirsten!

36:44.050 --> 36:46.751
Cameron: Kirsten!

36:47.059 --> 36:49.285
- Where is he?
- He said he was looking for you.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.062
Cameron: Kirsten!

37:00.689 --> 37:04.277
I said I was going to get
her, not go look for her.

37:04.302 --> 37:06.404
Okay, the police are coming.

37:06.811 --> 37:08.528
Just let us go.

37:08.553 --> 37:10.867
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

37:10.891 --> 37:12.586
No, pull up!

37:12.611 --> 37:14.939
- Cameron: Kirsten!
- You know, they can't get in here.

37:14.964 --> 37:17.143
You don't have to do this.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.866
This isn't my fault.

37:20.902 --> 37:24.341
It's Devon. It's always been Devon.

37:24.366 --> 37:27.493
Everybody's favorite.

37:27.518 --> 37:29.267
Is that why you killed him?

37:29.292 --> 37:31.227
He wanted me to let her go.

37:31.252 --> 37:33.059
Kelli?

37:33.524 --> 37:35.525
Yeah.

37:37.972 --> 37:40.591
He liked her.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.726
I had to get her away from him.

37:42.751 --> 37:43.893
Push it up!

37:44.352 --> 37:47.115
- Kirsten, we're coming!
- Camille!

37:47.140 --> 37:50.175
You know, when I'm through with you,

37:50.200 --> 37:52.636
your boyfriend's next.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.476
It was you, wasn't it? It
was you outside my window,

37:55.501 --> 37:58.977
and you in the hallway,
not Devon. You followed me.

37:59.002 --> 38:00.972
Yeah,

38:00.997 --> 38:04.602
there's something different about you.

38:04.627 --> 38:06.674
There's something not right.

38:06.699 --> 38:08.318
I swear, he didn't get that from me.

38:08.343 --> 38:11.245
Quiet. No, you're right.

38:11.270 --> 38:14.826
You're right. There is
something off about me.

38:14.851 --> 38:16.523
I'm just like you.

38:16.547 --> 38:19.939
No, see, you're not like me.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.999
Okay? Nobody is.

38:22.024 --> 38:25.527
I know. It's not easy being different.

38:25.552 --> 38:26.986
Trust me, I know.

38:27.010 --> 38:28.925
When you're different,

38:28.950 --> 38:32.733
people, they look at you strange, right?

38:32.758 --> 38:37.229
People treat you like you're a freak.

38:37.962 --> 38:41.215
That's what happened
to me when I was a kid.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.243
No one wanted to be around
me, not even my parents.

38:44.268 --> 38:46.821
Devon was supposed to be with me.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.241
Then, he went off with her.

38:49.266 --> 38:52.180
I know. He deserved to be punished.

38:52.721 --> 38:56.357
They both did, because
Devon, he betrayed you.

38:56.382 --> 38:59.130
Right? I get that.

38:59.155 --> 39:01.819
I do. I don't know what I would have done

39:01.844 --> 39:05.109
if I had a twin that everybody
thought was special and good.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.249
The twin that got to be out in the sun

39:07.274 --> 39:09.340
while I was kept hidden away.

39:11.007 --> 39:14.877
I get you, I get you,

39:14.902 --> 39:17.054
because I am just like you...

39:17.724 --> 39:21.123
In every way except one.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.644
I am nothing like you.

39:32.213 --> 39:34.809
Holy crapenstein.

39:43.836 --> 39:46.551
Well, the good news is you
weren't seeing a ghost.

39:46.576 --> 39:48.335
Kirsten: Yeah, bad news?

39:48.360 --> 39:52.263
We need to get some sort of
twin alert in the stitch lab.

39:52.288 --> 39:54.923
A phantasmic memory anomaly? Really?

39:54.948 --> 39:56.920
Sounds better than "evil twin."

39:56.945 --> 39:59.078
Or not.

39:59.103 --> 40:02.495
His name's Gavin. And I don't know how,

40:02.520 --> 40:04.671
but his existence was
completely off the record.

40:04.697 --> 40:06.769
Some parents don't deal
well with different.

40:06.794 --> 40:09.223
Yeah, real different.

40:09.248 --> 40:11.952
At least we cleared Devon's
name. It's all good now.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.707
Actually, it's not.

40:13.732 --> 40:16.202
Trespassing, breaking and entering,

40:16.227 --> 40:18.200
all for a Halloween party.

40:18.225 --> 40:20.189
An epic Halloween party.

40:20.214 --> 40:24.759
Thank you, weird space alien rocker?

40:24.784 --> 40:28.155
Thank you. See?

40:28.180 --> 40:29.971
Are you gonna arrest us?

40:30.867 --> 40:32.845
Only if you don't invite me next year.

40:32.870 --> 40:34.610
Oh!

40:34.985 --> 40:36.828
Later.

40:36.853 --> 40:40.184
Well, this was definitely
the scariest Halloween ever.

40:40.210 --> 40:43.538
I told you, I don't do scared.
