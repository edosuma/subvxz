Over 68 million Americans

00:03.278 --> 00:05.720
leave the safety of

If danger strikes,

00:07.820 --> 00:10.305
the FBI's International Response Team

is called into action.

We got you.

01:20.337 --> 01:22.040
Unit Chief Jack Garrett,

01:22.110 --> 01:24.008
you have the right to remain silent

01:24.126 --> 01:26.060
and refuse to answer questions today.

01:26.095 --> 01:28.029
If you give up that
right, anything you say

01:28.064 --> 01:30.897
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

01:30.933 --> 01:31.998
You have the right to consult

01:32.034 --> 01:34.901
with an attorney before
and during this questioning.

01:34.937 --> 01:37.003
If you cannot afford an attorney...

01:40.209 --> 01:42.176
I'm sorry.

01:42.218 --> 01:44.492
Unit Chief Garrett, do
you understand these rights

01:44.539 --> 01:46.106
as I've explained them to you?

01:47.413 --> 01:50.917
Yes.

02:35.554 --> 02:39.234
Are you willing to sit down
now and answer our questions?

02:39.288 --> 02:41.825
Yes.

02:43.929 --> 02:47.329
Jack, are you sure you
don't want your lawyer?

02:47.454 --> 02:49.366
It could get rough.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.143
I don't need a lawyer.

02:51.244 --> 02:53.752
Let the record reflect that
IRT Unit Chief Jack Garrett

02:53.830 --> 02:55.854
has waived his right
to counsel at this time.

02:56.065 --> 02:58.534
Let us identify those also
present for this session...

02:58.581 --> 03:00.500
Agents Brian Lynch and Jody Reynolds

03:00.535 --> 03:03.603
with the FBI's Office of
Professional Responsibility.

03:03.638 --> 03:06.539
Janice Reichel, Deputy
Counsel, District of Columbia,

03:06.575 --> 03:08.474
representing the Department of Justice.

03:08.510 --> 03:10.843
Walter Atwood, Deputy Director
of National Intelligence,

03:10.878 --> 03:13.479
and I am Linda Barnes,
Executive Assistant Director

03:13.515 --> 03:15.881
of the FBI's National Security Branch.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.371
Deputy Director Atwood
and I have been authorized

03:18.426 --> 03:20.715
to conduct this joint
inquiry for the FBI and DNI.

03:20.738 --> 03:22.004
Now, Unit Chief Garrett,

03:22.066 --> 03:23.322
can you walk us through the beginnings

03:23.357 --> 03:27.517
of Case Number 67-16-01
in Qalea, Kurjikistan?

03:27.587 --> 03:30.268
We were refueling in Lisbon,

03:30.323 --> 03:33.565
when Agent Russell
Montgomery gave notification

03:33.601 --> 03:36.836
about a request from the U.S. Ambassador

03:36.871 --> 03:39.471
and the Kurjikistan Foreign Minister.

03:39.506 --> 03:42.474
It was a double homicide
involving a U.S. citizen

03:42.509 --> 03:44.476
and a Kurjik national.

03:44.511 --> 03:47.495
Keri Lodel, 29. She's from
Providence, Rhode Island,

03:47.573 --> 03:49.815
and she worked as a network engineer

03:49.878 --> 03:53.385
for a U.S. contractor called
Global Strategem Development.

03:53.420 --> 03:57.157
Also, Aron Sabri, 32, from Qalea.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.900
He worked as a security guard for GSD.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.093
Now according to Captain Rifai
of the Kurjik National Police,

04:02.129 --> 04:04.362
Keri was stabbed to death
by by a co-worker who she was

04:04.397 --> 04:05.897
allegedly having an affair with.

04:05.932 --> 04:08.432
That man's name is Edward Delgado.

04:08.468 --> 04:11.002
Delgado is 46 years old,
from Alexandria, Virginia.

04:11.037 --> 04:12.621
He's a systems analyst,

04:12.746 --> 04:14.538
and he's married with
a 2-year-old daughter.

04:14.574 --> 04:17.107
Sabri, the local security
guard, appears to have died

04:17.142 --> 04:18.451
during the struggle with Delgado

04:18.522 --> 04:20.543
as he fled the GSD housing compound.

04:20.579 --> 04:21.845
So it looks like all this took place

04:21.899 --> 04:23.914
inside of Qalea's Steel Ring.

04:23.949 --> 04:25.416
Steel Ring?

04:25.451 --> 04:27.618
It's a heavily fortified
4-square-mile area

04:27.654 --> 04:29.419
much like Baghdad's Green Zone.

04:29.454 --> 04:32.724
Jack, uh, I know Delgado.

04:32.802 --> 04:33.599
You know him?

04:33.685 --> 04:35.302
I-I mean, knew him.

04:35.404 --> 04:38.528
We used to work together
for an NGO in Myanmar.

04:38.563 --> 04:39.529
When was this?

04:39.564 --> 04:42.565
Three years ago when I
took my leave of absence.

04:42.601 --> 04:43.877
What do you remember about him?

04:43.940 --> 04:46.536
Honestly, this doesn't
make any sense to me at all.

04:46.571 --> 04:48.938
The man that I knew... he could
barely raise his voice in anger,

04:48.973 --> 04:49.925
much less escalate to murder.

04:49.988 --> 04:52.793
Not only that, he's a fugitive now.

04:52.855 --> 04:55.291
As someone whose job
requires her to analyze

04:55.327 --> 04:58.227
and objectively profile the
behaviors of criminal suspects,

04:58.263 --> 05:01.097
wasn't Agent Seger's
judgment already compromised?

05:01.132 --> 05:02.297
No, not at all.

05:02.692 --> 05:03.791
Not at all?

05:04.128 --> 05:07.035
You don't believe Agent
Seger's history with Mr. Delgado

05:07.071 --> 05:10.238
could have in any way
impacted her ability to...

05:10.274 --> 05:12.374
No, I don't, just like I don't believe

05:12.409 --> 05:15.243
that Deputy Director Atwood's
longtime friendship with me

05:15.279 --> 05:17.212
is going to impact his
ability to be objective

05:17.247 --> 05:18.880
during this inquiry.

05:21.185 --> 05:23.308
Did Agent Seger disclose to you

05:23.371 --> 05:24.719
or to any other member of your team

05:24.754 --> 05:27.622
the full extent of her prior
relationship with Mr. Delgado?

05:27.657 --> 05:30.625
Agent Seger disclosed that
she previously worked with him

05:30.660 --> 05:32.160
in Myanmar three years ago.

05:32.196 --> 05:33.061
She didn't happen to mention

05:33.097 --> 05:36.564
her personal relationship with this man?

05:36.600 --> 05:41.503
No. She didn't mention it,
but... doesn't matter because...

05:41.538 --> 05:44.405
What matters is how well you
know the members of your team.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.274
No doubt this line of
questioning is important,

05:47.310 --> 05:49.176
but let me jump ahead.

05:49.212 --> 05:52.646
When you landed in country,
run us through the protocol.

05:52.681 --> 05:55.616
When we landed in Qalea,
we began coordinating

05:55.651 --> 05:58.085
with Captain Basir Rifai,

05:58.121 --> 06:00.488
head of the Kurjik National Police.

06:00.523 --> 06:02.856
Unfortunately, my men
have made little progress

06:02.892 --> 06:05.126
in our hunt for the
fugitive, Edward Delgado.

06:05.161 --> 06:08.428
We are beginning to believe he
may have escaped the Steel Ring

06:08.463 --> 06:11.097
and may in fact be already dead.

06:11.141 --> 06:12.716
Because as a westerner on the run,

06:12.826 --> 06:14.001
he could've easily fallen into the hands

06:14.036 --> 06:16.271
of the militant group,
the Brotherhood of Faith.

06:16.349 --> 06:19.025
Yes, one of many terror
groups that plague my country.

06:19.111 --> 06:20.106
Only this one was led

06:20.142 --> 06:23.049
by one of your former army
generals, Rashan Noori.

06:23.221 --> 06:25.711
Indeed. An even deeper wound for us.

06:25.747 --> 06:27.347
But Delgado's a pretty smart guy, right?

06:27.382 --> 06:28.981
So you think if he's
really gonna roll the dice

06:29.017 --> 06:30.983
outside the Ring, he's only gonna do it

06:31.019 --> 06:32.685
if he knows exactly where
he's gonna be able to hide

06:32.720 --> 06:33.853
for a little bit.

06:33.888 --> 06:37.390
You may be right, Agent
Jarvis, but in my experience,

06:37.426 --> 06:41.994
the desperate man always
makes the desperate choice.

06:42.030 --> 06:45.297
Well, right now Agent Seger and
I should inspect the crime scene

06:45.332 --> 06:48.000
while Agent Simmons here
evaluates our suspect's

06:48.036 --> 06:50.302
possible escape routes
from the housing compound.

06:50.337 --> 06:51.437
Yes, of course.

06:51.472 --> 06:55.007
I'd also like the bodies
of Keri Lodel and Aron Sabri

06:55.043 --> 06:56.709
brought back here so Agent Jarvis

06:56.744 --> 06:59.678
can conduct supplemental autopsies.

06:59.713 --> 07:01.846
I'll arrange for the transfer.

07:01.882 --> 07:04.015
Unit Chief, earlier you mentioned,

07:04.051 --> 07:07.152
if I'm not mistaken, that
the Kurjik Foreign Minister

07:07.188 --> 07:09.127
was one of the folks who had asked

07:09.174 --> 07:11.723
for the IRT's help in
this matter. Is that right?

07:11.758 --> 07:12.807
Yes, that's right.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.192
Did you or did you not

07:14.227 --> 07:17.929
acknowledge and respect
the lead investigative role

07:17.965 --> 07:20.431
of the local authority, Captain Rifai?

07:20.467 --> 07:24.069
Deputy Director, the
IRT's role, as always,

07:24.104 --> 07:28.039
was to advise and assist
Captain Rifai and the KNP

07:28.075 --> 07:30.508
during the course of this
double homicide investigation

07:30.543 --> 07:34.078
and the pursuit of the
fugitive, Edward Delgado.

07:34.114 --> 07:36.880
Now much of that advice and assistance

07:36.916 --> 07:38.849
comes from your team's ability

07:38.884 --> 07:41.085
to build these behavioral profiles

07:41.121 --> 07:42.260
of criminal suspects.

07:42.315 --> 07:43.721
- Is that right?
- Yes.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.623
And as Assistant Director Barnes

07:45.658 --> 07:49.559
has pointed out, Agent
Seger was familiar with...

07:49.595 --> 07:51.784
perhaps a bit too familiar with

07:51.846 --> 07:54.917
the particular subject, Mr. Delgado.

07:55.088 --> 07:57.467
Agent Seger demonstrated no bias

07:57.503 --> 07:58.969
during this investigation.

07:59.005 --> 08:00.270
In fact, her awareness

08:00.305 --> 08:02.606
of Mr. Delgado's actions in the past

08:02.642 --> 08:05.642
only helped to contextualize
the evidence we found

08:05.677 --> 08:07.344
at Keri Lodel's crime scene.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.053
Isn't GSD helping to update

08:17.088 --> 08:19.489
your department's technical security?

08:19.525 --> 08:22.591
It is. Some of my
officers knew the victim

08:22.627 --> 08:24.426
as well as Mr. Delgado.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.896
Did they ever see the two of
them out together socially?

08:26.931 --> 08:28.031
No.

08:28.448 --> 08:31.682
But your theory is a lover's
quarrel gone horribly wrong.

08:31.773 --> 08:34.303
Before the security guard
confronted Mr. Delgado,

08:34.337 --> 08:35.538
he radioed for help.

08:35.573 --> 08:39.073
It was 2 a.m., and he'd heard
screams from this apartment.

08:39.109 --> 08:41.842
He then pursued the suspect from here

08:41.879 --> 08:44.246
and confronted him on the
balcony at the end of the hall,

08:44.282 --> 08:47.179
but Mr. Delgado got the better of him.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.684
That doesn't confirm
an intimate relationship

08:48.719 --> 08:50.619
- between the two of them.
- No, I agree.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.955
It more strongly confirms
a probable sexual assault

08:54.186 --> 08:56.178
that escalated to murder.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.927
Just all this rage.

08:58.962 --> 09:02.043
Yeah, it's overkill. Something personal.

09:04.702 --> 09:06.334
What do you got, Mae?

09:06.369 --> 09:09.490
What I got is something
weird in Keri's tox panel.

09:09.553 --> 09:11.764
So she has Lorazepam in her system

09:11.818 --> 09:13.341
even though she does not
have a prescription for it,

09:13.376 --> 09:15.643
and the amount of the drug is so high,

09:15.679 --> 09:17.278
it's like she's been sedated.

09:17.314 --> 09:20.191
And on top of that, Keri has
no defensive wounds on her.

09:20.308 --> 09:20.981
So you think

09:21.017 --> 09:23.284
Keri was drugged, and then
she was stabbed to death.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.052
I mean, that's what
it's looking like to me.

09:25.088 --> 09:27.755
What about the second
victim, Aron Sabri?

09:27.810 --> 09:29.790
Well, the COD is blunt force trauma,

09:29.826 --> 09:31.992
which is consistent with
being tossed off a balcony,

09:32.028 --> 09:33.393
but unfortunately,

09:33.429 --> 09:35.329
the post-mortem injuries are making it

09:35.364 --> 09:37.364
really difficult for
me to confirm the extent

09:37.399 --> 09:39.498
of the struggle with the suspect,

09:39.552 --> 09:43.537
and I'm also really puzzled
by the abrasions on his hands.

09:43.572 --> 09:45.754
But, I mean, it is what it is.

09:46.004 --> 09:47.300
Okay, thanks, Mae.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.543
Jack, there is nothing
here to confirm or deny

09:49.578 --> 09:51.545
an intimate relationship
between these two.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.580
And there's certainly
nothing to tell why

09:53.616 --> 09:54.914
whatever relationship they did have

09:54.950 --> 09:56.516
took such a tragic turn.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.918
Maybe his room will tell us more.

09:58.954 --> 10:01.587
Maybe, but I really
think we need to conduct

10:01.623 --> 10:03.489
a deeper victimology of Keri Lodel.

10:03.524 --> 10:05.191
If you look at her mementos,

10:05.227 --> 10:07.693
she's obviously very popular
with lots of different people,

10:07.729 --> 10:09.595
any one of whom could have developed

10:09.631 --> 10:11.097
some twisted sense of an attachment

10:11.133 --> 10:12.932
that would have motivated this violence.

10:12.968 --> 10:16.135
Okay. We'll have Monty follow up.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.505
So to be clear, the next
step in your investigation

10:19.540 --> 10:21.674
was based on Agent
Seger's recommendation?

10:21.709 --> 10:25.678
No. Conducting a victimology
is part of our profile building.

10:25.713 --> 10:28.213
But you just described
how Agent Seger said

10:28.249 --> 10:31.049
a deeper victimology would
help you move off Delgado.

10:31.085 --> 10:32.550
That's not what I said,
and you keep trying

10:32.586 --> 10:34.253
to twist my words like that.

10:34.288 --> 10:36.699
- I'm only trying to clarify.
- You're trying to hang the IRT.

10:36.722 --> 10:38.316
That's what you're trying to do here.

10:38.386 --> 10:40.458
- Perhaps it's time we took a break.
- I think we're fine.

10:40.494 --> 10:43.195
- I think we're taking a break.
- Aron Sabri and Keri Lodel

10:43.230 --> 10:46.231
are not the only victims of this case.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.433
A civilian suspect lost his life

10:48.468 --> 10:51.269
because of the IRT's reckless actions.

10:51.305 --> 10:53.471
You think I want to hang the IRT?

10:53.914 --> 10:57.517
Unit Chief Garrett, let me
be crystal clear with you.

10:57.603 --> 10:59.043
When we are all done here today,

10:59.078 --> 11:01.579
I will have everything
I need to shatter the IRT

11:01.615 --> 11:02.914
into a thousand pieces

11:02.949 --> 11:04.916
and scatter the remnants to the wind.

11:10.323 --> 11:11.388
What's your big secret?

11:13.534 --> 11:17.932
Well, that could have gone... better.

11:18.034 --> 11:21.740
- It's going fine.
- Mm, 'cause you don't think

11:21.775 --> 11:24.676
it's hard to prove bias
when you lay your own cards

11:24.712 --> 11:26.378
out on the table like that?

11:26.413 --> 11:28.346
You need to tread lightly.

11:28.382 --> 11:29.280
Is that so?

11:29.316 --> 11:31.994
Yes, it is. This isn't just an inquiry.

11:32.049 --> 11:34.219
This is a political game of chess.

11:34.254 --> 11:35.754
You like chess?

11:35.789 --> 11:37.655
I like boxing.

11:37.690 --> 11:41.559
I see that. Now I love chess myself.

11:41.594 --> 11:45.196
Requires patience and
understanding strategy

11:45.232 --> 11:47.265
and of human weakness.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.061
Plus you always get to be king.

11:50.131 --> 11:53.104
Not that I don't appreciate
the pep talk, but I don't.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.439
Settle down. I'm trying to protect you,

11:55.474 --> 11:58.664
and if you really
wanna see justice done,

11:58.774 --> 12:01.810
you will gather the
facts... just the facts,

12:01.941 --> 12:04.709
and let the powers that be do the rest.

12:22.797 --> 12:24.064
I shouldn't have to remind you

12:24.099 --> 12:26.099
that no one in this
room is under arrest.

12:26.134 --> 12:27.369
So if you don't mind,

12:27.435 --> 12:30.470
I'm gonna go stretch my
legs and get some coffee.

12:32.474 --> 12:34.206
Anybody want anything?

12:34.690 --> 12:35.945
This is ridiculous.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.210
Look, I think it's
best if we avoid sharing

12:38.246 --> 12:40.279
for the time being.

12:40.314 --> 12:41.714
You think they wired the room?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.350
Why would they wire the room?

12:44.385 --> 12:46.618
Because while we are not
actually under arrest,

12:46.653 --> 12:49.121
we're prohibited from discussing
anything that has to do

12:49.156 --> 12:51.357
with the case with each other.

12:51.392 --> 12:52.958
Unbelievable. What do they
think that we're gonna do,

12:52.994 --> 12:54.593
sit in here and try
to line our stories up?

12:54.628 --> 12:56.253
That's exactly what they think,

12:56.363 --> 12:58.130
and even the mere
appearance of collusion

12:58.165 --> 13:01.566
is cause for termination if
not straight up prosecution.

13:08.776 --> 13:11.276
So... how are Karen and the kids?

13:11.311 --> 13:13.779
Oh, come on, Walt. Cut the crap.

13:13.814 --> 13:16.480
I'm sorry, man. This is tough.

13:16.516 --> 13:19.317
But I want you to know I got your back.

13:19.352 --> 13:21.419
I don't need you to have my back.

13:21.454 --> 13:23.492
Jack, you heard the woman yourself.

13:23.555 --> 13:26.657
This is not about who
is right or who is wrong.

13:26.692 --> 13:28.426
This is about who's to blame.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.929
Walt, we did everything by the book.

13:30.964 --> 13:34.264
I know you did, Jack,
but we got a body count.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.735
So book or no book,
somebody screwed the pooch.

13:37.770 --> 13:40.805
I just don't want that
somebody to be you.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.507
You're not done with me yet.

13:43.543 --> 13:45.075
No, we're not.

13:45.110 --> 13:50.314
But you and Barnes needed
a time-out, so... excuse me.

13:56.989 --> 14:00.590
Agent Seger, three years ago,
you took a leave of absence.

14:00.625 --> 14:04.194
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

14:04.229 --> 14:06.529
- Why?
- Yes, that's the question.

14:06.565 --> 14:08.498
Uh, I'm not sure that I understand.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.334
You have my personal file
sitting right in front of you.

14:11.369 --> 14:13.636
You know exactly why
I took the time off.

14:13.672 --> 14:18.107
Yes, I do know why.
Unfortunately, I suspect

14:18.142 --> 14:20.276
some of my tricks as an interrogator

14:20.311 --> 14:23.946
are going to be transparent to
an expert in forensic psychology

14:23.982 --> 14:25.547
such as yourself, am I right?

14:25.583 --> 14:28.184
I'd only ask your indulgence.

14:28.219 --> 14:30.019
Or you can choose to
not answer the question,

14:30.054 --> 14:32.221
but that might suggest something
about your state of mind,

14:32.256 --> 14:33.255
don't you think?

14:33.291 --> 14:37.460
You want to play games?
I can play your game.

14:37.495 --> 14:40.228
Three years ago,

14:40.263 --> 14:43.999
my husband, SSA Brad Seger...

14:44.034 --> 14:47.302
he was killed in the line of duty,

14:47.337 --> 14:51.272
and I took a leave of
absence for bereavement.

14:53.944 --> 14:55.843
I'm very sorry for your loss.

14:57.114 --> 14:59.814
Thank you.

14:59.849 --> 15:01.916
During your bereavement leave,
you traveled extensively,

15:01.951 --> 15:05.153
but I'd like to focus on
the time you spent in Myanmar

15:05.188 --> 15:06.687
three years ago, during which time

15:06.723 --> 15:11.326
you became... quite
familiar with Edward Delgado,

15:11.361 --> 15:12.760
the man who would later become

15:12.795 --> 15:14.695
the focus of the investigation in Qalea

15:14.731 --> 15:16.931
and the man whose
complicated connection to you

15:16.966 --> 15:19.433
- would prejudice your team.
- That is not true.

15:19.468 --> 15:21.736
Regardless of my personal
knowledge of Delgado,

15:21.771 --> 15:24.314
my team, without prejudice,
pursued this man as a fugitive

15:24.368 --> 15:25.376
from the law.

15:25.384 --> 15:28.175
In fact, it was Agent Montgomery
who reached out to his wife

15:28.210 --> 15:31.178
to get a better understanding
of where he might seek refuge.

15:35.217 --> 15:38.919
Agent Montgomery, I haven't
been able to get a hold

15:38.954 --> 15:40.921
of my husband in 24 hours.

15:40.956 --> 15:44.291
- Mrs. Delgado...
- Please call me Amelia.

15:44.326 --> 15:46.927
Amelia, please.

15:50.865 --> 15:53.125
There was an incident at
the GSD housing compound.

15:53.258 --> 15:54.477
Two people were killed.

15:54.531 --> 15:57.295
One was a woman who worked with
your husband named Keri Lodel.

15:57.365 --> 16:00.874
The other was a security
guard named Aron Sabri.

16:02.743 --> 16:04.610
Your husband is also missing.

16:04.645 --> 16:06.912
Missing?

16:06.948 --> 16:08.581
What do you mean, missing?

16:08.616 --> 16:09.748
Amelia, when was the last time

16:09.784 --> 16:11.117
you communicated with your husband?

16:11.152 --> 16:13.319
He e-mailed me yesterday morning.

16:13.354 --> 16:14.587
What did he say?

16:14.622 --> 16:16.556
Nothing. He just sent me photos.

16:16.591 --> 16:18.090
May I see them?

16:28.302 --> 16:30.002
How often did the two of you communicate

16:30.037 --> 16:32.071
while he was overseas?

16:32.106 --> 16:34.406
Once a week, mainly by e-mail.

16:34.441 --> 16:38.410
Must have been tough... for both of you.

16:38.445 --> 16:41.646
Why do I get the feeling that
what you really wanna ask me

16:41.681 --> 16:44.516
is if I think my husband
was sleeping with Keri.

16:44.551 --> 16:47.285
Is it possible?

16:47.321 --> 16:49.921
No, it isn't.

16:49.956 --> 16:52.857
He sent me those photos so
that I could see his friends,

16:52.892 --> 16:54.993
that's all.

16:55.028 --> 16:56.127
Okay.

16:56.162 --> 16:59.697
Well, was your husband under
any unusual stress lately?

16:59.733 --> 17:02.166
No, not that I know of.

17:02.201 --> 17:06.337
He's a good man. He
gets along with everyone.

17:06.372 --> 17:11.208
I swear, he'd never hurt anyone.

17:11.243 --> 17:12.510
Delgado's wife gave me access

17:12.545 --> 17:14.145
to all of her husband's social media,

17:14.180 --> 17:16.446
and I'm going through it
now, but I gotta be honest,

17:16.482 --> 17:18.482
Amelia seemed to know
her husband really well.

17:18.518 --> 17:20.183
So if he wasn't having
an affair with Keri,

17:20.223 --> 17:22.012
then what would be
his motive to kill her?

17:22.066 --> 17:23.417
Well, if Delgado didn't kill Keri,

17:23.559 --> 17:24.692
then why does he attack the guard?

17:24.785 --> 17:25.917
And why does he run?

17:25.996 --> 17:28.157
Which brings us to our
more pressing question...

17:28.193 --> 17:30.060
where is Edward Delgado?

17:30.095 --> 17:33.396
Listen, guilty or not, he's
not some hardened criminal.

17:33.431 --> 17:35.498
He is a stranger in a strange land,

17:35.534 --> 17:36.533
and it's like Mae said before.

17:36.568 --> 17:39.069
If he did manage to sneak
out of the Steel Ring,

17:39.104 --> 17:40.703
it's because he knows
someone on the other side

17:40.738 --> 17:42.372
who might protect him.

17:42.407 --> 17:44.707
I may have found something.

17:44.742 --> 17:46.643
Looks like Delgado got pretty close

17:46.678 --> 17:48.678
to the family of his first interpreter.

17:48.713 --> 17:50.746
Young man's name is Omar Tahan.

17:50.782 --> 17:52.148
I apologize, Agent Seger.

17:52.184 --> 17:53.775
What was the young man's name again?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.152
Omar Tahan. He was Delgado's translator

17:56.188 --> 17:58.587
for two weeks until those
duties were transferred

17:58.622 --> 18:00.022
to an officer from the KNP.

18:00.058 --> 18:02.091
And why were those duties transferred?

18:02.126 --> 18:05.995
Delgado's work exposed him to
confidential KNP communications,

18:06.030 --> 18:09.331
and Mr. Tahan would have
not been permitted access.

18:09.366 --> 18:11.366
Once you identified Mr. Tahan,

18:11.402 --> 18:13.768
what did you or your team do next?

18:13.804 --> 18:15.704
We drove out to the Tahan house.

18:15.739 --> 18:18.407
It was located 1 mile
northwest of the Steel Ring,

18:18.442 --> 18:21.610
and that's where we discovered
Mr. Delgado hiding out.

18:21.645 --> 18:23.178
Did he offer any resistance?

18:23.214 --> 18:26.448
No, he did not. He came into
custody without incident.

18:26.483 --> 18:28.729
Agent Seger, whose decision was it

18:28.760 --> 18:31.796
to transport Edward
Delgado back to the IRT jet

18:31.843 --> 18:35.123
rather than transfer him
immediately into KNP custody?

18:35.158 --> 18:37.425
That was Unit Chief Garrett's decision.

18:37.460 --> 18:40.762
And do you recall if you
perhaps challenged that decision?

18:40.797 --> 18:42.797
- No.
- No, you don't recall, or...

18:42.833 --> 18:45.967
- No, I did not challenge it.
- Did you encourage it?

18:46.002 --> 18:47.735
Look, at this point,
Delgado was a suspect

18:47.770 --> 18:49.136
in a joint task force investigation

18:49.171 --> 18:51.739
between the IRT and the KNP.

18:51.774 --> 18:53.907
It was well within Unit
Chief Garrett's purview

18:53.943 --> 18:56.210
to bring a suspect onto
the jet for questioning.

18:56.246 --> 18:59.647
- And who questioned him?
- I did.

19:12.628 --> 19:16.463
You gotta talk to me, Ed.

19:16.498 --> 19:18.065
You have to tell me what happened

19:18.100 --> 19:21.167
in the apartment with the guard.

19:21.202 --> 19:25.238
Why did you run?

19:25.274 --> 19:28.508
Were you sleeping with her?

19:28.543 --> 19:31.778
What do you think?

19:31.813 --> 19:34.247
Honestly, I don't
think you'd ever betray

19:34.283 --> 19:36.182
the mother of your child.

19:36.217 --> 19:40.519
I just... wanna go home,

19:40.554 --> 19:44.090
and I swear to God I didn't do this.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.358
I know, so let me help you.

19:46.394 --> 19:49.328
But you don't understand. You can't.

19:51.499 --> 19:53.632
This is insane.

19:53.668 --> 19:56.769
You being here, dropping into my life,

19:56.804 --> 19:59.571
just like you did before.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.441
To "save" me.

20:08.316 --> 20:12.284
No, I think we saved each other.

20:12.319 --> 20:15.220
Did we?

20:15.255 --> 20:19.557
You know, I still remember
exactly where we were

20:19.592 --> 20:21.026
when you told me we were together

20:21.061 --> 20:23.361
for all the wrong reasons.

20:23.396 --> 20:26.831
But the crazy thing is,

20:26.866 --> 20:31.669
if you don't leave me,
then I don't go home.

20:31.705 --> 20:34.444
I don't get married, and...

20:34.554 --> 20:37.342
I don't get my baby
girl, Julia, in my life.

20:37.377 --> 20:38.909
Yeah, and I don't get

20:38.945 --> 20:41.919
to be here with you
right now to help you.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.148
You have to trust me, Ed.

20:44.183 --> 20:49.320
Truth is, there is only one
person in the whole world

20:49.355 --> 20:51.421
that I trust, Clara.

20:51.457 --> 20:55.627
Clara, Jack just got off
the phone with Captain Rifai.

20:55.784 --> 20:57.694
He's asking us to transfer
him to KNP custody.

20:57.730 --> 20:59.396
KNP? No, hold on a second.

20:59.431 --> 21:02.332
I'm an American citizen
arrested by the FBI.

21:02.368 --> 21:04.067
Why can't you guys hold on to me?

21:04.102 --> 21:05.736
Okay, everything is gonna be okay, Ed.

21:05.771 --> 21:08.572
My team and I will be with
you every step of the way.

21:08.607 --> 21:09.906
It's a joint investigation.

21:09.941 --> 21:11.541
Actually, it was
easier bringing him here

21:11.577 --> 21:13.176
than it will be getting
him back to the Steel Ring,

21:13.211 --> 21:14.845
so I'll need to coordinate
security protocols

21:14.880 --> 21:16.246
for Captain Rifai.

21:16.281 --> 21:19.615
Okay, I'll get him ready.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.384
Security protocols?

21:21.419 --> 21:23.786
Such as encrypting communications

21:23.813 --> 21:25.884
between the KNP and the IRT

21:26.126 --> 21:28.591
before, during, and
after prisoner transfers.

21:28.626 --> 21:30.360
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

21:30.395 --> 21:35.780
Excuse me, SSA Simmons.
Could we rewind a moment here?

21:35.866 --> 21:38.267
You get the call from Captain Rifai.

21:38.302 --> 21:39.869
He asks you to give him the guy.

21:39.904 --> 21:43.372
Could you walk me through
what should have happened next?

21:43.408 --> 21:46.208
The plan was for the IRT
to convoy the prisoner

21:46.243 --> 21:49.044
back to KNP headquarters
inside the Steel Ring.

21:49.079 --> 21:51.046
We were to travel by
way of secured route,

21:51.081 --> 21:52.491
mapped by Captain Rifai.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.049
The primary concern for the operation

21:54.084 --> 21:55.750
was to avoid the main road

21:55.786 --> 21:57.719
between the airport and the Steel Ring.

21:57.754 --> 21:59.955
Right, because what do
they call that road...

21:59.990 --> 22:01.423
"Damnation Alley"?

22:01.458 --> 22:03.959
Agent Simmons, we know
what should have happened.

22:03.994 --> 22:07.561
- Tell us what did happen.
- We were ambushed

22:07.596 --> 22:10.028
by fighters loyal to
the Brotherhood of Faith.

22:10.098 --> 22:11.765
And do you know how you were targeted?

22:11.801 --> 22:13.301
How?

22:13.336 --> 22:16.103
No. It was a random attack.

22:16.139 --> 22:17.405
Random?

22:17.440 --> 22:19.740
It wasn't random.

22:19.775 --> 22:21.008
You were found because you got caught

22:21.044 --> 22:23.837
talking on open lines of communication.

22:23.931 --> 22:28.782
That's impossible. I
personally secured those lines.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.854
Well, you tell me, sir.

22:33.889 --> 22:37.658
Are you incompetent,
or are you a traitor?

22:37.693 --> 22:41.328
'Cause the digital
evidence says no encryption.

22:46.701 --> 22:48.001
These logs can't be right.

22:48.036 --> 22:50.670
Those logs are from the KNP server.

22:50.705 --> 22:53.340
What happened during the ambush?

22:53.375 --> 22:55.708
We engaged in evasive maneuvers.

22:55.743 --> 22:58.377
At one point, we were
forced off the road,

22:58.412 --> 22:59.779
and a gun battle ensued.

22:59.814 --> 23:01.814
The prisoner was hit by gunfire.

23:01.850 --> 23:04.817
You got Delgado shot.

23:04.853 --> 23:06.719
It was at that point
the decision was made

23:06.754 --> 23:08.153
to double back to the jet.

23:08.189 --> 23:11.190
- Who made that decision?
- Unit Chief Garrett.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.525
It was the only chance we
had to save Delgado's life.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.376
Was that your unit
chief's medical opinion

23:15.431 --> 23:18.497
or that of his field medical
examiner, Agent Mae Jarvis?

23:18.532 --> 23:19.531
You know, I don't know.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.900
I was too busy getting
us the hell out of there.

23:21.935 --> 23:24.069
Tell us what happened once
you got back to the jet.

23:24.105 --> 23:27.239
Delgado had been shot in the chest.

23:27.274 --> 23:28.507
Here, here. I got him out of the SUV,

23:28.542 --> 23:30.876
and I was gonna help carry
him up to the conference room,

23:30.911 --> 23:32.844
and that's when they
tried to board the plane.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.714
"They" being those Brotherhood boys.

23:35.749 --> 23:38.850
Yes. Clara and Mae and
the rest of our flight crew

23:38.886 --> 23:40.351
got Delgado out of the line of fire.

23:40.387 --> 23:41.987
All right, bring him right in here.

23:42.022 --> 23:44.255
Okay.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.724
Clara, can you get his vest off?

23:45.759 --> 23:47.658
Okay.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.859
I mean, there was a lot of chaos.

23:54.034 --> 23:55.866
Jack and I were able to hold them back

23:55.902 --> 23:57.435
while Clara and Mae tended to Delgado.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.037
We should get an oxygen line started.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.873
Tighter.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.775
And nobody else got injured?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.010
I'm sorry?

24:06.045 --> 24:08.913
Delgado was the only one who got shot.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.914
Yes, he was.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.116
We were able to get the
cargo bay doors closed.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.625
But you weren't able to save
Delgado's life, were you?

24:22.661 --> 24:25.795
Come on. Stay with me. Come on.

24:25.830 --> 24:26.930
Mae.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.465
Come on, Edward!

24:32.837 --> 24:35.605
Okay, tell me what to do. What do I do?

24:37.809 --> 24:39.909
Mae?

24:39.945 --> 24:41.778
He's gone.

24:46.348 --> 24:47.680
I'm sorry.

24:53.788 --> 24:55.410
Looks like they're regrouping, Jack.

24:55.463 --> 24:57.106
Probably calling in reinforcements.

24:57.145 --> 24:59.075
Well, you don't think they're gonna
try and board the plane, do you?

24:59.129 --> 25:00.960
I don't want to have to find out.

25:00.995 --> 25:03.713
Captain Rifai, where's
our backup you promised?

25:03.782 --> 25:05.494
They are en route to you now.

25:05.518 --> 25:07.866
SSA Jarvis, when Unit Chief Garrett

25:07.901 --> 25:09.401
ordered the unit back to the jet,

25:09.436 --> 25:11.731
did you know the full extent
of Mr. Delgado's injuries?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.192
Um, I had identified an entry wound

25:14.262 --> 25:15.887
to his upper right thoracic region,

25:15.926 --> 25:19.342
and I suspected that
his lung had collapsed.

25:19.397 --> 25:21.380
- So did you challenge the order?
- No

25:21.415 --> 25:24.193
You had a man with a gaping chest wound,

25:24.256 --> 25:27.395
and you didn't insist on being
rerouted to U.S. Camp Granato,

25:27.442 --> 25:28.895
where they have a field hospital?

25:28.926 --> 25:31.051
No, I didn't... because

25:31.192 --> 25:33.109
I mean, truth is, I knew
that what I had on the plane

25:33.144 --> 25:36.942
could stabilize him, and everything else

25:36.958 --> 25:38.114
was just an unknown variable,

25:38.149 --> 25:40.816
and it was all happening
while we were under enemy fire.

25:40.852 --> 25:43.176
I get it. It was tough out there.

25:43.254 --> 25:46.055
- Yeah, it was.
- Maybe that speaks to why,

25:46.091 --> 25:49.058
after medical school, you
became a medical examiner

25:49.094 --> 25:51.427
instead of continuing
in trauma medicine.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.229
Excuse me?

25:53.265 --> 25:56.266
Do you recall a young man

25:56.301 --> 26:00.436
by the name of Dylan Jacobs?

26:00.471 --> 26:03.755
Yeah. Yeah, I remember Dylan.

26:03.825 --> 26:07.380
You were a resident at
St. Colette's Trauma Center

26:07.434 --> 26:08.497
the night he was brought in.

26:08.544 --> 26:10.145
Do you recall what happened to him?

26:10.180 --> 26:13.315
Yeah, he died on the table.

26:13.350 --> 26:16.318
And his family felt that
you and Dr. Justin Wyatt

26:16.353 --> 26:18.020
and the hospital were negligent.

26:18.055 --> 26:19.288
They filed a lawsuit.

26:19.323 --> 26:21.990
Uh, that was settled out of court

26:22.026 --> 26:24.326
with a nondisclosure agreement.

26:24.361 --> 26:28.048
So are you saying you can't
disclose whether or not

26:28.099 --> 26:30.800
you feel responsible
for Mr. Jacobs' death?

26:39.075 --> 26:41.916
Jack, I am so sorry.

26:42.010 --> 26:43.518
I-I should have told you everything.

26:43.557 --> 26:45.082
No, it's all right, Clara.

26:45.144 --> 26:48.382
You told me everything you needed to.

26:48.418 --> 26:50.517
Hey, guys, listen.

26:50.553 --> 26:52.719
I-I know we're not supposed to talk,

26:52.755 --> 26:54.655
but there is something
else going on here.

26:54.690 --> 26:57.420
Barnes and Atwood basically blamed me

26:57.490 --> 26:59.053
for the entire ambush.

26:59.131 --> 27:02.075
They said that I didn't encrypt
the lines of communications,

27:02.138 --> 27:03.730
and what they offered as proof

27:03.766 --> 27:06.232
were the digital log books
from the KNP command post.

27:06.268 --> 27:08.234
I'm telling you, those
logs were doctored.

27:08.270 --> 27:11.173
But, presumably, only
somebody who works for the KNP

27:11.236 --> 27:12.973
- could have done that.
- Right.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.175
Clara, I think you were
right from the start.

27:15.210 --> 27:19.412
Delgado never fit the
profile of Keri's killer.

27:19.448 --> 27:22.415
Question is, why did he run?

27:22.451 --> 27:24.150
Maybe he didn't trust the local cops.

27:24.186 --> 27:28.388
Maybe. Delgado's job focused
primarily on improving

27:28.423 --> 27:30.723
cybersecurity for the KNP,

27:30.758 --> 27:32.311
so what if he came across something

27:32.358 --> 27:34.160
that he shouldn't have?

27:34.196 --> 27:36.261
A secret, something so compromising

27:36.297 --> 27:38.263
that someone inside the KNP would be

27:38.299 --> 27:40.366
willing to frame him for murder.

27:40.401 --> 27:42.835
Okay, but consider this.

27:42.871 --> 27:45.437
You know that security
guard, Aron Sabri?

27:45.473 --> 27:47.373
He was only moonlighting
at the GSD compound.

27:47.408 --> 27:50.342
His primary job was
patrol officer for the KNP.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.111
Remember the abrasions on his hands?

27:52.146 --> 27:54.279
The ones that Mae
really couldn't explain?

27:54.315 --> 27:56.515
What if they hadn't come
from a struggle with Delgado?

27:56.550 --> 27:58.417
What if they were a
result of stabbing Keri

27:58.452 --> 27:59.618
over and over again?

27:59.653 --> 28:02.754
So you think the original
plan was the guard kills Keri,

28:02.789 --> 28:06.225
then he kills Delgado
as he tries to escape.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.693
Only Delgado got the better of him.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.962
Unfortunately, as good as this sounds,

28:10.998 --> 28:12.296
it's pure speculation.

28:12.332 --> 28:14.432
Yeah, and given our current status,

28:14.467 --> 28:16.299
we need some hard evidence to prove

28:16.335 --> 28:18.636
that someone from the KNP
was behind all of this.

28:18.671 --> 28:20.604
And I'm not sure we're gonna
be able to prove anything

28:20.640 --> 28:23.206
when we've been stripped of everything.

28:23.242 --> 28:27.611
Maybe not everything. Look,
if we're right about Delgado,

28:27.647 --> 28:30.217
and he did discover the
KNP's dirty little secret,

28:30.225 --> 28:32.084
if he's the man that I remember,

28:32.115 --> 28:33.550
he would have hedged
his bets on the evidence.

28:33.585 --> 28:34.784
What do you mean?

28:34.819 --> 28:37.054
I think that he would
have sent his proof

28:37.089 --> 28:39.022
to the only person in
the world that he trusts.

28:53.271 --> 28:56.539
- You okay?
- Sure.

29:02.180 --> 29:03.980
Look, you know they're just
playing these mind games

29:04.015 --> 29:06.648
in order to try to break you.

29:06.684 --> 29:07.816
Yeah, well, they're ballers at it,

29:07.851 --> 29:11.320
'cause I feel pretty broken.

29:11.355 --> 29:14.856
It'll be all right.

29:14.892 --> 29:16.459
I mean, I don't care what anybody says.

29:16.494 --> 29:21.162
When you have someone's
life in your hands,

29:21.198 --> 29:25.166
you feel the weight
of that responsibility.

29:25.202 --> 29:28.770
And, yeah, you can... You
can put on a brave face,

29:28.806 --> 29:32.874
but I don't think you
ever really learn how to...

29:32.910 --> 29:37.012
turn your emotions on and off.

29:37.047 --> 29:39.380
And if you lose that person,

29:39.416 --> 29:42.383
You never stop second-guessing yourself.

29:51.027 --> 29:53.794
Agent Montgomery, I'd like
to direct your attention

29:53.830 --> 29:58.866
to the events that took place
after Mr. Delgado's death.

29:58.901 --> 30:02.536
You recall receiving a
distress call from Betsy Ross?

30:02.571 --> 30:03.838
Yes, I do.

30:03.873 --> 30:04.905
Hey, boss, what's going on?

30:04.941 --> 30:06.230
We're in trouble.

30:06.253 --> 30:07.842
We got ambushed by the Brotherhood.

30:07.877 --> 30:10.077
We sustained a casualty. It looks like

30:10.113 --> 30:11.578
they're gonna try to board the plane.

30:11.614 --> 30:12.979
Okay, I'll call the KNP right now.

30:13.015 --> 30:14.381
I tried that. They're too far away.

30:14.416 --> 30:16.049
I need you to call in the cavalry

30:16.084 --> 30:18.485
from U.S. Camp Granato right now.

30:19.622 --> 30:22.922
Why did you ignore Unit
Chief Garrett's direct order?

30:22.958 --> 30:25.454
I didn't ignore it. I
assessed the situation.

30:25.516 --> 30:27.393
I looked at the map.
They were too far away.

30:27.428 --> 30:29.763
Perhaps you would be willing to tell us

30:29.798 --> 30:33.102
when you first became
aware of the existence

30:33.157 --> 30:35.935
of the Z-TAC Nighthawk S-2.

30:35.971 --> 30:40.239
I can't tell you about a program
that doesn't exist, now, can I?

30:40.275 --> 30:41.675
You must think you're pretty smart.

30:41.710 --> 30:44.009
I think the Nighthawk S-2
is the worst kept secret

30:44.045 --> 30:45.678
in the U.S. Intelligence community.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.713
Did Jack Garrett
direct you to compromise

30:47.748 --> 30:49.448
the Nighthawk system?

30:49.484 --> 30:51.184
No, he did not.

30:51.219 --> 30:53.452
- What's going on?
- They're knocking at the door.

30:53.488 --> 30:54.720
Okay, Jack, the way I see it,

30:54.755 --> 30:56.556
your only option is
to take off right now.

30:56.591 --> 30:58.591
I'm not sure how that's gonna happen.

30:58.626 --> 31:00.559
- They've got us surrounded.
- Not for long.

31:05.232 --> 31:07.443
Agent Montgomery,

31:07.482 --> 31:10.135
do you know what it
means to misappropriate

31:10.171 --> 31:15.440
and destroy a $164 million
unmanned aerial vehicle?

31:15.475 --> 31:16.941
With all due respect, $164 million

31:16.976 --> 31:19.377
suggests that you're including
the R&D on the project.

31:19.413 --> 31:23.114
The price tag for a single
drone is $3.74 million.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.283
Do you honestly think this is a joke?

31:25.319 --> 31:27.619
Yes. Do you wanna know
if I stole the drone?

31:27.654 --> 31:31.590
Yes, I stole the drone because
there were men with guns

31:31.625 --> 31:33.457
going after my team, so I hacked

31:33.492 --> 31:35.659
the nearest surveillance drone in flight

31:35.695 --> 31:39.964
and I strafed the airfield
with it... several times.

31:41.201 --> 31:42.399
Thank God those boys

31:42.435 --> 31:43.601
over at the Brotherhood of Faith

31:43.636 --> 31:44.736
are really bad at skeet shooting,

31:44.771 --> 31:47.972
because that gave them time
to draw away from the plane

31:48.007 --> 31:52.943
and for me to create a
$3.74 million light show,

31:52.978 --> 31:54.778
which allowed my team
to get off the tarmac

31:54.813 --> 31:56.280
and get out of harm's way.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.014
Were you aware of enemy casualties?

31:58.050 --> 32:01.485
There were none. You didn't
know that at the time.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.620
I understand at the end of all this,

32:02.655 --> 32:04.282
there has to be a blame game,

32:04.360 --> 32:06.356
but the truth of the matter is

32:06.391 --> 32:10.127
there's only a chosen few
who will ever be qualified

32:10.162 --> 32:11.628
to work in the field.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.264
There's no other way to say it.

32:14.299 --> 32:20.036
Their instincts, their
judgment, their courage...

32:20.072 --> 32:24.607
it's better... because it has to be.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.343
Because in the heat of the moment,

32:27.379 --> 32:29.679
they make the hard choices.

32:29.714 --> 32:33.983
And do you think that you
are one of those chosen few?

32:36.220 --> 32:38.854
I don't think it.

32:38.890 --> 32:42.370
I know, so I did what
I did. I'd do it again,

32:42.417 --> 32:45.360
and I'm now prepared to accept
the consequences of my actions.

32:45.396 --> 32:48.563
Good, because, Agent Montgomery...

32:48.599 --> 32:50.465
... you're under arrest,

32:50.501 --> 32:52.467
for willful theft, malfeasance,

32:52.503 --> 32:54.736
and destruction of government property.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.971
I need your badge.

33:09.115 --> 33:10.548
Hello, Amelia.

33:10.583 --> 33:13.951
Thank you for, uh, for meeting me.

33:17.023 --> 33:20.491
Ed and I had no secrets, Clara.

33:20.526 --> 33:22.626
I came here today because I know

33:22.662 --> 33:24.628
that you were important to his life,

33:24.664 --> 33:26.763
and I really need someone
to get justice for him

33:26.799 --> 33:28.899
and for Keri.

33:28.934 --> 33:31.335
That's exactly what I intend to do.

33:31.370 --> 33:36.940
May I see the photos
that he e-mailed you?

33:44.516 --> 33:46.249
Did Ed have a habit

33:46.284 --> 33:47.951
of sending you candid
snapshots like these?

33:47.986 --> 33:51.254
No. But I'm glad he did.

33:53.892 --> 33:56.359
Do you mind e-mailing
me copies of these?

33:56.394 --> 33:58.528
Why?

33:58.563 --> 34:00.129
Amelia, my team and I believe

34:00.164 --> 34:01.797
that Ed was framed for Keri's murder

34:01.833 --> 34:03.633
because of a secret that he discovered,

34:03.668 --> 34:06.436
and I think these photos will tell me

34:06.471 --> 34:08.804
exactly what that secret is.

34:12.744 --> 34:15.511
Hey, what's going on here?

34:15.547 --> 34:17.512
- It's all right, Jack.
- No, it's not all right.

34:17.547 --> 34:20.449
Let it go, my friend. Let it play out.

34:20.498 --> 34:22.241
It's all part of the process.

34:22.288 --> 34:23.194
What's the charge?

34:23.248 --> 34:26.155
What does it matter, Jack?
This is the worst of it.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.623
Walter, listen to me.
Delgado was set up.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.525
I may have a way to get the evidence.

34:30.553 --> 34:32.581
Agent Seger and Simmons
are working on...

34:32.587 --> 34:33.359
Whoa, whoa.

34:33.397 --> 34:35.063
Seger and Simmons can't
be working on anything.

34:35.098 --> 34:36.465
You know that.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.467
Oh, damn it, Jack. You
have just opened yourself

34:39.503 --> 34:42.304
right back up. We're
talking insubordination.

34:42.339 --> 34:44.406
Yeah, yeah, not to mention

34:44.440 --> 34:47.342
conduct unbecoming a federal officer.

34:47.378 --> 34:50.311
Take him back upstairs.

35:04.861 --> 35:09.863
Please, take a seat.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.235
Unit Chief Garrett,

35:11.282 --> 35:12.432
during the course of
the proceedings today,

35:12.467 --> 35:14.834
did you or did you not communicate

35:14.869 --> 35:16.703
with members of your IRT unit?

35:16.738 --> 35:18.338
- I did.
- Where and when did

35:18.373 --> 35:20.507
these prohibited
communications take place?

35:20.542 --> 35:22.175
Like the rest of my team,

35:22.210 --> 35:24.778
I feel responsible for
Mr. Delgado's death.

35:24.813 --> 35:26.680
- That wasn't the question.
- It's the reason we're here.

35:26.715 --> 35:27.880
Unit Chief Garrett.

35:27.916 --> 35:30.449
The real reason that Mr. Delgado is dead

35:30.484 --> 35:32.218
is betrayal.

35:32.253 --> 35:35.354
What are you talking about?

35:35.389 --> 35:36.222
He was a good man doing good work,

35:36.257 --> 35:39.092
who, by chance, uncovered a secret.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.060
He found out about a
deal between the KNP

35:41.095 --> 35:43.229
and the leader of the
Brotherhood of Faith,

35:43.264 --> 35:45.597
Rashan Noori.

35:45.633 --> 35:47.265
In exchange for ratting
out terrorist cells,

35:47.301 --> 35:49.100
Noori was guaranteed that the KNP

35:49.136 --> 35:50.469
would turn a blind eye

35:50.504 --> 35:52.604
toward its own criminal activities

35:52.640 --> 35:55.874
which include the trafficking
of Kurjik children.

35:55.909 --> 35:57.458
You know all this how?

35:57.513 --> 35:59.812
Delgado followed the protocol.

35:59.847 --> 36:01.813
He met with the U.S. Ombudsman in Qalea.

36:01.849 --> 36:04.950
He offered evidence, but
to answer your question,

36:04.985 --> 36:08.820
I know about all this
because Mr. Delgado

36:08.856 --> 36:11.089
also violated protocol.

36:11.124 --> 36:14.726
He sent copies of the
same evidence to his wife

36:14.761 --> 36:18.663
in encrypted messages in photos.

36:18.698 --> 36:22.633
Like this one.

36:22.669 --> 36:26.571
Saying that Edward
Delgado used steganography?

36:26.606 --> 36:30.575
Yes. He was able to camouflage
one digital file within another,

36:30.610 --> 36:33.478
and if you continue to
swipe past those images,

36:33.513 --> 36:35.775
you'll find the encryption
that was provided to me

36:35.861 --> 36:38.648
by BAU Technical
Analyst, Penelope Garcia.

36:38.684 --> 36:40.484
Let me see that.

36:41.988 --> 36:44.621
Despite this evidence, your conduct...

36:44.656 --> 36:46.690
This evidence helps
to prove that the IRT

36:46.725 --> 36:49.593
was also set up, just like Delgado.

36:49.628 --> 36:50.527
Set up?

36:50.562 --> 36:52.929
Yes, because the most compromising part

36:52.964 --> 36:55.965
of this deal with the
devil is that it was all

36:56.001 --> 36:59.936
illegally sanctioned by a
U.S. Intelligence officer.

36:59.971 --> 37:01.705
That's why Delgado had to be framed.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.340
That's why my team had to be ambushed...

37:04.376 --> 37:07.944
to protect the identity of the officer,

37:07.979 --> 37:09.345
code-named "Bishop."

37:09.381 --> 37:12.448
I have an obligation to
tell you that if you accuse

37:12.483 --> 37:14.683
an Intelligence officer of a crime

37:14.719 --> 37:16.286
without sufficient evidence...

37:16.321 --> 37:18.288
That's the real trick, isn't it?

37:18.323 --> 37:20.390
How do you get to the
truth in a shadow world

37:20.425 --> 37:22.491
defended by lies?

37:22.527 --> 37:26.462
I like to think that's where
profiling comes in handy.

37:26.497 --> 37:31.233
The ability to decipher
motive behind behavior,

37:31.268 --> 37:33.803
the liar behind the lie.

37:35.092 --> 37:36.654
Something tells me you think

37:36.686 --> 37:38.334
you already know the
answer to that, Jack.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.675
I think I do, Linda.

37:39.710 --> 37:44.246
First, you have to ask
yourself who benefits?

37:44.281 --> 37:46.648
Who would be best served
by taking advantage

37:46.683 --> 37:49.017
of an off-the-shelf resource like Noori?

37:49.053 --> 37:51.353
But more importantly,
who would have the nerve

37:51.388 --> 37:55.424
to make that deal with the devil?

37:55.459 --> 37:57.559
It would have to be
somebody who felt comfortable

37:57.594 --> 38:00.562
rationalizing all those necessary evils

38:00.597 --> 38:03.698
in order to protect the greater good.

38:03.733 --> 38:05.333
It'd have to be somebody
who believes that

38:05.368 --> 38:07.220
the ends always justify the means.

38:07.298 --> 38:08.169
Right.

38:08.204 --> 38:11.072
You see what I'm saying?

38:11.107 --> 38:16.377
Bishop. So maybe even someone who enjoys

38:16.412 --> 38:17.778
the game of chess?

38:17.813 --> 38:20.614
Because in chess, the
Bishop's personality

38:20.649 --> 38:25.086
is often considered sly, cunning...

38:25.121 --> 38:26.753
and corrupt.

38:26.789 --> 38:29.756
Plus you always get to be king.

38:31.594 --> 38:33.426
Assistant Director Barnes,

38:33.462 --> 38:36.597
I would consider your
next move carefully.

38:36.632 --> 38:39.466
Oh. I am.

38:39.502 --> 38:42.068
Deputy Director Atwood,
you're under arrest.

38:42.104 --> 38:43.637
You have the right to remain silent.

38:43.672 --> 38:46.072
You can't be serious.

38:46.108 --> 38:49.376
Jack's psycho profile
B.S. isn't evidence.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.977
But the e-mails that Agent Garcia

38:51.013 --> 38:53.713
found on your private
server are, Walter.

38:53.748 --> 38:58.751
You have no idea what you've done.

38:58.786 --> 39:00.586
You son of a bitch.

39:00.622 --> 39:02.422
You had Delgado killed.

39:02.457 --> 39:03.823
You put my team in the line of fire

39:03.858 --> 39:05.558
like we were expendable.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.559
You are expendable!

39:06.594 --> 39:09.662
Because you're soldiers,
Jack, just like I am.

39:09.697 --> 39:11.898
And soldiers sacrifice themselves

39:11.933 --> 39:14.066
so others won't have to.

39:14.101 --> 39:17.269
You think I like lying
down with dogs like Noori?

39:17.304 --> 39:19.804
You're damn right it's a necessary evil.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.742
You know why? Because
we're at war, my friends.

39:23.777 --> 39:26.145
Make no mistake, just
because we're telling people

39:26.180 --> 39:28.313
to keep streaming and shopping,

39:28.349 --> 39:31.816
we're in a dog fight for
everything we hold to be true.

39:31.852 --> 39:33.785
And without men like me,

39:33.820 --> 39:36.621
without men willing to
do what is necessary,

39:36.657 --> 39:38.456
we will lose!

39:38.491 --> 39:40.358
Spare me the self-righteousness,

39:40.393 --> 39:43.194
and don't you dare compare yourself

39:43.229 --> 39:45.463
to the men and women in uniform.

39:45.498 --> 39:48.132
You're a clerk

39:48.168 --> 39:49.467
and a criminal.

39:49.502 --> 39:51.570
Get him outta here.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.386
How you doing?

40:09.421 --> 40:10.820
Better,

40:10.852 --> 40:12.195
now that I got the handcuffs off.

40:12.273 --> 40:15.793
But... what's going on?

40:17.763 --> 40:20.197
Given our current state of affairs,

40:20.232 --> 40:22.700
I've agreed to this little tête-à-tête.

40:22.735 --> 40:23.734
Thank you.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.335
Obviously, I've made no secret

40:25.370 --> 40:28.004
about my desire to
diminish the IRT's role.

40:28.039 --> 40:29.539
You'd like to get rid of us.

40:29.575 --> 40:30.873
I'd like you to be accountable.

40:30.909 --> 40:33.243
We are. We always have been.

40:33.278 --> 40:34.978
Then why did you ask me here, Jack?

40:35.013 --> 40:37.847
If not to ask for leniency
for Agent Montgomery?

40:37.882 --> 40:39.749
And this is what I'm talking about.

40:39.784 --> 40:42.585
The fact remains that in
spite of his good intentions

40:42.621 --> 40:44.587
or the positive
results, Agent Montgomery

40:44.623 --> 40:47.156
must be held accountable
for his actions.

40:47.191 --> 40:48.858
And even if I were to recommend

40:48.893 --> 40:50.927
not seeking criminal prosecution,

40:50.962 --> 40:53.663
at the very least, the Bureau
must terminate his employment.

40:53.698 --> 40:55.932
She's right, Jack.

40:55.967 --> 40:57.433
No, I don't think so.

40:57.468 --> 41:00.002
Because Agent Montgomery's actions

41:00.037 --> 41:02.171
or any actions taken
by a member of my team

41:02.206 --> 41:04.006
are done on my orders,

41:04.041 --> 41:06.342
whether directly stated or implied.

41:06.377 --> 41:08.210
The buck stops with me, always,

41:08.246 --> 41:11.680
so if anyone's gonna get fired, it's me.

41:11.715 --> 41:13.715
I'm serious, Linda.

41:13.751 --> 41:15.784
I know you are, Jack, but I'm not sure

41:15.819 --> 41:18.253
you appreciate the scope
of the situation here.

41:18.288 --> 41:19.254
You just took down

41:19.289 --> 41:21.056
the Deputy Director of
National Intelligence.

41:21.091 --> 41:23.025
Now I'm gonna be the
one to take your badge?

41:23.060 --> 41:25.927
Yes, because that's how it works.

41:25.963 --> 41:27.763
That's accountability.

41:31.734 --> 41:34.869
Unit Chief Jack Garrett,
let me be crystal clear.

41:34.904 --> 41:38.739
You and your unit are on notice.

41:38.775 --> 41:40.441
You may consider this your first strike,

41:40.477 --> 41:42.109
and in this game, a second strike means

41:42.145 --> 41:45.413
you are out.

41:55.257 --> 41:56.824
You good?

41:56.859 --> 42:00.260
Me? Forget about me. They
were about to lock you up.

42:00.296 --> 42:01.962
Yeah, but I knew you guys
would come break me out, right?

42:01.998 --> 42:03.597
Or share a cell with you.

42:03.632 --> 42:05.532
We had each other's backs.

42:05.767 --> 42:11.004
Yes, we did. Let's go
home, get some rest.

42:11.039 --> 42:12.906
Uh, guys?

42:16.445 --> 42:19.979
Well... no rest for the wicked.

42:22.050 --> 42:23.917
No.

42:23.952 --> 42:27.420
'Cause we got a job to do.
