00:19.185 --> 00:20.561
<i>Since the dawn of time...</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:25.107
<i>...storytellers have enchanted
audiences with their words.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:28.318
<i>But there is an even rarer gift:</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:31.822
<i>There are those,
who by reading out loud...</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:35.409
...can bring characters to life.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.288
<i>Out of books and into our world.</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:42.791
Go to sleep now. Shh.
Go to sleep, baby girl.

00:42.959 --> 00:46.170
- Maybe this will work. Let me read to her.
She's too young.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.255
- No.
- Shh.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.090
Why don't you read to me?

00:54.429 --> 00:57.056
"Once upon a time,
there was a dear little girl...

00:57.599 --> 00:59.933
...who was loved
by everyone who met her...

01:00.101 --> 01:04.229
...but especially by her grandmother,
who would've given her anything.

01:05.022 --> 01:11.195
Once she gave her
a little hood of red velvet."

01:12.155 --> 01:13.155
What was that?

01:16.117 --> 01:17.701
What?

01:19.287 --> 01:21.497
I don't know. Nothing.

01:25.835 --> 01:29.296
"Red velvet that suited her so well...

01:29.464 --> 01:32.299
...that she refused to wear
anything instead of it.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.595
So she was called
Little Red Riding Hood."

01:38.306 --> 01:41.266
Most of these Silvertongues,
as they are known...

01:41.434 --> 01:43.477
...prefer to keep their skills a secret.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.022
But some do not even know
that this gift is theirs...

01:47.982 --> 01:49.858
...until it is too late.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.210
Is this the right way?
Next turn on the left.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.545
Are you sure?
Because I think we missed it.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.506
Who's the driver? Dad.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.008
Who's the navigator? Me.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.553
- Have I ever got us lost before?
- No.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.096
No.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.390
Oh, hey. Look, a Sasquatch.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.560
Hey! Oh, the turning, left, left, left!

02:40.869 --> 02:45.080
The Alpine Antiquarian Bookshop
should be at the end of this street...

02:45.248 --> 02:47.416
...and on the right-hand
side of the square.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.126
Good.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.546
By the way, how come every bookshop
we go to is a thousand years old?

02:52.714 --> 02:56.550
Why can't we go to one that sells hot
chocolate and books that are actually new?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.595
What good would a bookbinder
like me be in a new bookstore?

02:59.762 --> 03:04.683
- I love old books. The marbled pages...
- End papers, the leather binding...

03:05.476 --> 03:07.603
This is my kind of place.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.274
- Maybe you'll find it here, Mo.
- Find what?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.693
That book you're always looking for.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.780
- I'm not looking for anything particular.
You don't think I've noticed?

03:18.948 --> 03:21.992
You never leave a bookshop unless
you've checked every corner.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.163
- Don't we?
- No, you always come away disappointed.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.833
Sometimes your eyes
are even a little red.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.211
It's because old books are dusty.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.756
Hey, look, Harriet the Spy.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.799
I'm going inside. You want to come?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.928
- The Secret Garden!
- Or I guess you could stay here.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.411
Afternoon. I'm Mortimer Folchart.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.248
Ah! The famous book doctor.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.834
Well, you're just in time.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.336
Look at this poor patient.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.838
- Uh-oh.
- Do you think we can save him?

04:17.005 --> 04:18.966
- I think the prognosis is good.
- Excellent.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.136
- Quite the collection you have.
- Yes.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.556
- If you'd like to look around, be my guest.
- Thank you.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.528
<i>Fine, intelligent eye.</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:42.197
<i>What do you say to calling him
Black Beauty?</i>

04:45.660 --> 04:46.827
<i>Oh, my dear child.</i>

04:49.539 --> 04:50.706
<i>Imagine, Heidi.</i>

04:50.873 --> 04:53.875
<i>Capricorn's men were looking
for Dustfinger in the wrong place.</i>

04:54.043 --> 04:55.711
<i>Southwest end of Treasure Island.</i>

04:55.878 --> 04:58.213
<i>He hadn't left the village.</i>

04:59.173 --> 05:01.383
<i>He hadn't even tried.</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:07.639
<i>Dustfinger was in Basta's house.</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:12.352
<i>What is that? Coming over
the hill? It's a beast of some kind!</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:41.048
Dustfinger.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.430
He doesn't like to be tickled.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.099
And you should be more careful.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.143
His name's Gwin.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.103
And I know he looks charming...

05:55.730 --> 05:58.940
...but you know what they say
about books and covers.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.115
Uh... Yeah, I do.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.202
I also know what they say about
talking to strangers. Excuse me.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.579
But I'm not a stranger, Meggie.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.209
You won't remember me, we only
met once, and you were quite small.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.753
But I'm no stranger.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.716
Hello, Silvertongue.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.137
I was just having a talk
with your daughter.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.057
Meggie, go wait for me in the van.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.975
It's all right, he's a friend.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.603
- Dad.
- Do it now!

06:41.109 --> 06:43.652
Let's you and me go for a little walk.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.956
I've been looking for you.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.458
I've been one step behind you for years.

06:59.293 --> 07:02.337
Waiting for you to find what it is
you've been searching for.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.840
Just tell me what you want.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.343
I want you to put right
the wrong you did 9 years ago.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.930
And I'm here to warn you,
Capricorn knows where you're staying.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.767
His men are there now waiting for you
and your daughter to come home.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.520
- He wants you to read for him.
- Well, he's out of luck.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.897
I don't read aloud anymore.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.819
If he finds you, you really think
you'll have a choice?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.956
I could help you stay hidden, but I won't.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.877
Not unless you promise to send me home.
I've been here too long.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.754
Send me home, Silvertongue.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.008
- Read to me.
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.927
It's too dangerous. It's uncontrollable.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.723
If you won't help me, I'll find
someone who can. Just give me the book.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.058
What book? I don't have the book.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.061
- You don't have the book?
- No.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.856
I've searched everywhere. I don't have it.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.524
What's in the bag?

08:08.362 --> 08:09.821
Did you finally find one?

08:09.989 --> 08:13.909
It's funny, isn't it? Strange, my turning
up here right at that very moment.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.580
You know, there are times in life
when the stars just simply align.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.749
But this is not one of those times!

08:26.088 --> 08:27.380
Dad!

08:37.099 --> 08:38.642
- Meggie!
- What's happening?

08:38.808 --> 08:41.561
I told you to stay in the van! Run!

08:45.066 --> 08:46.107
Get in, get in!

08:49.403 --> 08:50.445
Come on. Start!

08:55.660 --> 08:58.245
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

09:05.086 --> 09:07.879
- What are you doing? Leave it alone.
- I want to see the book!

09:08.047 --> 09:09.965
You're not to touch that book,
understand?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.300
I don't understand.
I don't understand at all.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.762
What is that book? Why did the freaky man
with the scars want it?

09:15.930 --> 09:18.640
- Why did he call you Silvertongue?
- I can't tell you.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.935
- You have to tell me.
- No. I have to protect you.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.478
And your mother.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.566
My mother? What has this
got to do with my mother?

09:28.484 --> 09:30.402
Meggie, please just...

09:33.447 --> 09:34.614
I'm scared, Mo.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.703
Meggie, I'm going to take care of you.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.163
I always have, and I always will.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.625
At least tell me where we're going.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.168
We're going to Italy.

09:47.795 --> 09:52.007
You have a great aunt there.
It's very important that we get there. Okay?

09:52.174 --> 09:55.510
Please, Meggie. No more questions.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.259
So she's friendly,
this great aunt of mine?

10:36.427 --> 10:37.552
You'll like her.

10:39.388 --> 10:43.099
Would you please
stop ringing that damn bell!

10:43.559 --> 10:46.436
After a while.
She's kind of an acquired taste.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.812
Right.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.648
What?

10:50.358 --> 10:51.650
Elinor.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.736
Well, for the love of Thomas Hardy.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.199
I'm so glad you've finally made
your way back here, Mortimer.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.910
My poor books
are in a terrible state of disrepair.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.912
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.915
Don't play with your food, child.
You're not a toddler.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.084
Look at her, she's as thin
as a soap bubble.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.588
Oh, she so reminds me
of her mother.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.008
Not just when she opens her mouth,
if she ever does. Speaking of...

11:17.176 --> 11:19.427
We haven't heard from her,
if that's what you mean.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.720
Oh, well, no matter.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.015
I grew up without a mother.
Didn't do me any damage whatsoever.

11:24.934 --> 11:29.062
No, my mother just suddenly dashed off
on safari one day and never came back.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.651
It's what the women in our family
seem to do, they just go off on adventures.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.986
Not me, I prefer to stay where I am.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.947
But your mother...

11:39.490 --> 11:41.282
Well, she wanted the real thing.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.660
My mum wanted me.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.287
And then one day she was gone,
without explanation.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.958
- Is that what you call an adventure?
- No, that's what I call abandonment.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.005
Well done, Elinor.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.174
Oh, well, you know it's the truth.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.137
Mum did not abandon us.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.723
No. No, she didn't.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.267
Well, then what really happened to her?

12:09.311 --> 12:13.314
- I'm not a child anymore. I'm all grown up.
- Almost.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.526
Enough to know the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.320
Don't you think I've realized
why I'm not in regular school?

12:19.488 --> 12:22.365
And why we're always
traveling around from place to place?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.370
All these years
you've been looking for Mum.

12:27.538 --> 12:31.249
And that book, but I just don't
understand how those two things...

12:31.417 --> 12:32.917
Meggie.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.671
You have to tell me something.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.096
- I write about her sometimes.
- You do?

12:45.264 --> 12:46.765
Yeah. I make up stories about...

12:46.932 --> 12:50.685
You make up stories? Meggie, you know
I don't want you doing that.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.355
But I have to.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.609
I feel like the words bring her
back to me.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.236
Yeah.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.906
The written word.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.533
It's a powerful thing.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.952
You have to be careful with it.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.665
Do you think we'll ever see her again?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.045
I hope we do, Meggie.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.257
I hope we do.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.898
Step away from that case!
Three steps back!

14:20.776 --> 14:22.861
What are you doing?
This place is not for children.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.946
I thought I made that clear.
Come on, out.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.782
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a book to read.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.284
Is that a nose print?

14:29.952 --> 14:33.955
Do you have any idea
how valuable this manuscript is?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.748
Yes, I know.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.083
Oh, you know, do you?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.210
It's Persian, isn't it?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.296
I can tell from the illuminations...

14:41.463 --> 14:44.465
...the pinks and the blues
and the gold-patterned background.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.969
Maybe from the late 12th century or so?

14:48.804 --> 14:51.139
Goodness me, what a little know-it-all.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.473
It's beautiful.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.562
Yes, it is, isn't it?
But I just adore everything Persian.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.231
- You've been to Persia, then?
- Yes, a hundred times.

15:00.399 --> 15:05.153
Along with St. Petersburg, Paris,
Middle Earth, distant planets and Shangri-la.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.946
And I never had to leave this room.

15:07.114 --> 15:11.910
Books are adventure. They contain murder
and mayhem and passion.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.455
They love anyone who opens them.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.627
If I promise not to touch anything...

15:21.170 --> 15:24.005
...could I maybe just sit
and read in here for a while?

15:27.509 --> 15:30.261
That was the window seat
where she used to curl up and read.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.096
She?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.018
Your mother.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.855
Your father used to read to her here.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.692
This was hers.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.113
If I find even a bookmark out of place,
I'll lock this room up...

15:49.281 --> 15:52.867
...and you'll never see the inside
of it again, that I can promise you.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.064
<i>Then Dorian Gray half opened the door.</i>

16:24.566 --> 16:26.067
<i>As he did so...</i>

17:09.569 --> 17:11.112
<i>Farewell...</i>

17:11.280 --> 17:12.405
<i>Trapped inside...</i>

17:14.616 --> 17:15.700
<i>Desire of revenge...</i>

17:27.128 --> 17:28.421
I tried to warn you.

17:30.215 --> 17:34.093
I gave you every opportunity
to help me, but you refused.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.972
All you had to do was read me back.
You could have kept the book.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.807
But you had to run.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.310
So I turned to Capricorn.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.646
- What?
- He's promised to help me.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.440
What have you done?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.861
Meggie!

18:02.998 --> 18:06.000
There are men outside!
They're trying to break into the house!

18:22.434 --> 18:23.976
Meggie!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.233
Mo, look out!

18:32.986 --> 18:34.654
Mortimer, my books!

18:36.573 --> 18:38.199
Hello, Silvertongue.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.867
- Basta?
- Did you miss me?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.327
Stop!

18:42.454 --> 18:44.705
Oh, you illiterate cretins!
Hold him!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.958
These are masterpieces
you're destroying!

18:47.126 --> 18:50.545
Masterpieces, you ignorant halfwit!

18:52.840 --> 18:55.883
Stop!
I swear, I'll kill every last one of you!

18:56.051 --> 18:58.219
You know I could!
It would take a few words!

18:58.387 --> 19:02.140
Oh, we won't have to worry about
your words if we cut out your tongue!

19:02.307 --> 19:05.309
You remember my calling card,
don't you?

19:05.477 --> 19:06.727
One, two, three!

19:06.895 --> 19:08.855
If that doesn't work...

19:09.898 --> 19:12.483
...well, there's always your daughter.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.156
- Get off me!
- No one gets hurt.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.740
Yes, the fire! The fire.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.743
Isn't that what we agreed?
Isn't that what we agreed?

19:22.911 --> 19:25.580
Yes, we agreed, we agreed, we agreed!

19:28.250 --> 19:31.169
Evil spirits, I repel thee.
Evil spirits, I repel thee!

19:31.336 --> 19:32.753
Dad! Dad!

19:32.921 --> 19:34.922
Right, get them in the van.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.717
- You're not taking them too.
- Capricorn's orders.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.845
After all, we are going
to require a little leverage...

19:42.222 --> 19:43.347
...to make Daddy read.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.017
Meggie!

19:47.686 --> 19:52.398
Don't drag my daughter into this.
For God's sakes, she's just a child.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.233
- No, don't! No!
- What's this?

19:54.401 --> 19:56.110
- No.
- My only hope of finding my wife.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.778
- My only hope of going home!
- No!

19:57.946 --> 20:00.281
What is it? When will you
tell me what is going on?

20:00.449 --> 20:03.784
Has your father ever read you
a bedtime story, Meggie?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.454
- You might want to ask him why.
- Give me this.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.415
I'll take that!

20:15.923 --> 20:16.964
No!

20:17.132 --> 20:19.508
Oh, my books! No!

20:19.676 --> 20:21.802
Come along, now. Hurry up.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.848
Oh, my books!

20:28.977 --> 20:30.144
Come on!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.380
Meggie.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.097
Where are we?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.210
They're here.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.839
Hey, they're coming!

22:03.572 --> 22:04.905
Oh, how lovely.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.741
After you.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.660
Come on, out! Out!

22:10.245 --> 22:11.704
Oh, they're rude!

22:14.499 --> 22:17.543
Move! Move!

22:28.472 --> 22:29.930
It's ticking.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.946
Flying monkeys.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.539
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.083
Welcome to our humble abode.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.043
- Enjoy your stay.
- Go on!

22:59.211 --> 23:02.797
No, I will not share this filthy hovel
with all those creatures!

23:02.964 --> 23:04.840
Go on, get in!

23:05.008 --> 23:06.050
In you go!

23:10.138 --> 23:12.139
What are we doing here, Mortimer?

23:13.975 --> 23:16.435
Where did those monsters come from?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.313
Books.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.776
They came out of books.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.319
What are you talking about?

23:25.487 --> 23:30.324
Mortimer, be quick, be clear,
or I swear I'll disinherit you.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.664
Came out of books? What do you mean?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.501
Come here.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.508
Meggie...

23:49.219 --> 23:51.846
...this is the story
you have been waiting to hear.

23:53.306 --> 23:57.268
Elinor, you were away at a book fair...

23:57.436 --> 24:02.356
...and we were housesitting for you.
Me, Meggie, your mum.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.486
<i>And that night we were in the library...</i>

24:08.864 --> 24:11.365
<i>...so I opened a copy
of a book we'd just bought.</i>

24:12.492 --> 24:13.800
Inkheart.

24:15.177 --> 24:16.177
Inkheart.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.374
<i>It was a good read.
Full of adventure and magic...</i>

24:21.710 --> 24:24.503
<i>...and a creature called The Shadow.
Terrifying.</i>

24:24.880 --> 24:27.214
<i>I read several chapters aloud
and nothing happened.</i>

24:30.343 --> 24:32.219
<i>Then they appeared, out of nowhere...</i>

24:32.846 --> 24:36.223
<i>...from the medieval world of the book.
At first it was Capricorn...</i>

24:37.726 --> 24:40.853
<i>...a thuggish bandit
working for an evil duke.</i>

24:48.904 --> 24:52.990
<i>Then Basta, his knife-wielding sidekick.</i>

24:55.202 --> 24:57.369
<i>And then Dustfinger...</i>

24:58.705 --> 25:01.916
<i>...a traveling fire juggler
with magical powers.</i>

25:04.628 --> 25:05.920
My voice brought them out.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.881
Your voice brought them out
of the book?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.174
And her mother went in.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.259
That's how it works.

25:17.098 --> 25:20.059
Dustfinger saved us
from Capricorn that night.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.937
It was only then that I realized...

25:23.939 --> 25:26.398
...Resa, your mum...

25:26.566 --> 25:27.608
...she was gone.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.947
They'd come out of the book,
and she went into it.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.203
Resa!

25:40.038 --> 25:43.082
And that, Meggie, was the last time
that I read to you.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.584
The night we lost your mother.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.884
Oh, she went into the book.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.307
Oh. Goodness sake, Mortimer!

26:00.475 --> 26:03.269
All these years you've allowed me
to think the worst of Resa!

26:03.436 --> 26:06.605
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Would you have believed me?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.275
You want to read Mum
back out of the book.

26:10.986 --> 26:14.154
That's why you've been searching
for Inkheart all these years.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.742
If she's alive, you mean.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.328
You say she's trapped in that book.
How do you know?

26:21.496 --> 26:23.497
Who's to say she got there? If she did...

26:23.665 --> 26:28.002
...how could she survive for nine years
if the monsters are anything like those?

26:28.169 --> 26:29.503
Or worse.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.173
How do you know where she is?
Or if she's alive, even.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.634
How do you know?

26:40.849 --> 26:43.392
- It's like the illustration in the book.
- Kind of scary.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.769
It's hideous. The man's got
no taste whatsoever.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.479
Look, will you stop pushing me!

26:53.153 --> 26:57.448
Meggie, just pretend that you're in a book.
Children always escape in books.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.907
No, they don't.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.826
Remember The Little Match Girl?

27:00.994 --> 27:03.621
They found her in an alley
frozen to death.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.374
Walk.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.051
Come in.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.803
We saved you the good seats.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.555
Capricorn.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.100
Uh! I told you to stop that!

27:25.268 --> 27:26.727
Please.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.981
You got old.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.232
You got a castle.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.401
- Indeed, I did.
- And a haircut.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.946
A lovely castle in a secluded part
of the country...

27:38.114 --> 27:40.282
...far from prying eyes.

27:41.660 --> 27:46.914
Oh, yes, I've adjusted rather well
to your world, don't you think?

27:48.917 --> 27:52.544
This must be your daughter.
So much life to live.

27:52.712 --> 27:57.091
You, however, are a noisy old bag. You
make a racket without opening your mouth.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.259
You barbaric piece of pulp fiction!

27:59.427 --> 28:01.929
Your malice is matched by your stupidity!

28:02.097 --> 28:05.057
I don't know how things are
in that third-rate novel of yours...

28:05.225 --> 28:08.560
...but where I come from one
does not go around ravaging libraries!

28:08.728 --> 28:14.942
My life's work, destroyed
by a bunch of unread, solecistic thugs!

28:15.110 --> 28:18.779
I have no patience
for old women with big mouths.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.199
You know my reader.

28:22.659 --> 28:26.537
Darius, why don't we show our guests
what I have been up against?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.205
Read that.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.332
But you said...

28:30.500 --> 28:34.294
...I wouldn't have to read
once he got here.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.755
Yes, well, I lied, didn't I,
when I said that?

28:38.466 --> 28:40.050
Read the book.

28:41.219 --> 28:46.557
"Rapunzel had splendid long hair.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.894
It was as fine as spun gold.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.105
And when she heard..."

29:00.405 --> 29:02.573
Help! No!

29:04.075 --> 29:05.576
Help!

29:08.830 --> 29:10.164
You see?

29:10.331 --> 29:13.792
Look at the writing on her face.
She's only been half read out of the book.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.336
- Take her to the dungeon.
No!

29:16.504 --> 29:19.173
- And give her a haircut.
No!

29:19.382 --> 29:22.468
I'm not going to read out loud,
if that's what you're intending.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.804
- Not with them in the room.
- Bring the girl up, please.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.016
You take your...

29:39.527 --> 29:42.696
Here's how this will work: You'll
do exactly what I tell you to do...

29:42.864 --> 29:47.117
...or I'll kill the old lady and lock
your daughter up for eternity. Is that clear?

29:50.705 --> 29:53.040
Great. Well, let's get things started,
shall we?

29:55.960 --> 29:59.880
This is a great book, filled with riches.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.345
Reading out treasure?

30:06.513 --> 30:10.224
For now. Someone has to pay for repairs,
and all the locals have been bled dry.

30:11.226 --> 30:15.229
I'm warning you. I have no control
over what comes and goes.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.565
I have no idea what's going to happen.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.735
Well, this should be fun, then.
Let's give it a whirl.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.667
<i>"Kasim gazed upon the treasures
within the cave.</i>

30:37.335 --> 30:42.631
<i>Mountains of gold and silver
were heaped from floor to ceiling.</i>

30:42.799 --> 30:46.510
<i>Piles of silks and sacks of jewels.</i>

30:47.762 --> 30:50.681
<i>Kasim gathered all the treasure
he could carry...</i>

30:50.849 --> 30:54.977
<i>...only to find
the door of the cave sealed shut.</i>

30:56.145 --> 30:57.813
<i>And by the will of Allah...</i>

30:58.439 --> 31:00.148
...he'd forgotten the password.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.026
<i>He cried out, 'Open Barley! '</i>

31:03.695 --> 31:07.447
<i>But the door did not budge. Kasim named
every grain of wheat he could think of.</i>

31:07.949 --> 31:10.784
<i>'Open Buckwheat! ' 'Open Millet! '</i>

31:10.952 --> 31:13.620
<i>But still the door would not open.</i>

31:14.163 --> 31:16.790
<i>Then came the sound
of approaching hooves."</i>

31:22.672 --> 31:23.714
<i>Sand.</i>

31:31.848 --> 31:36.727
<i>"Kasim ran to hide, but tripped,
sending coins spilling in every direction.</i>

31:36.895 --> 31:40.147
<i>Then came the muffled call of
'Open Sesame! '</i>

31:40.648 --> 31:42.566
<i>And the cave opened...</i>

31:43.651 --> 31:47.321
<i>...to reveal
a most unpleasant collection...</i>

31:48.531 --> 31:50.157
<i>...of bandits."</i>

31:51.034 --> 31:52.075
What?

32:32.867 --> 32:33.867
You see?

32:34.869 --> 32:36.536
Yes! Yes!

32:36.704 --> 32:38.038
That's how it's done!

32:41.626 --> 32:43.460
Look! What'd I tell you?

32:43.962 --> 32:48.215
Put that boy in the stable and feed him
to the ticking crocodile.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.884
But if he came out, who went in?

32:57.725 --> 32:58.550
Help.

33:00.190 --> 33:01.300
Help.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.220
It's my turn now.

33:06.730 --> 33:08.550
It's my turn now.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.404
Just like you promised.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.197
Your turn?

33:14.951 --> 33:17.577
Oh, you mean this.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.917
It's an incredibly rare book, this.
We've been tracking them down for years.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.169
I can't send you back. I don't know how.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.255
Send us back?

33:30.174 --> 33:32.926
Why would we ever want to go back...

33:33.094 --> 33:36.096
...when your world is so accommodating?

33:36.264 --> 33:39.433
With your telephones
and your guns and...

33:39.767 --> 33:41.268
What's that sticky stuff called?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.730
- Duct tape.
- Yes, duct tape.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.357
I love duct tape.

33:48.317 --> 33:51.153
Besides, what was I in Inkheart?

33:52.155 --> 33:53.780
The Adderhead's henchman.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.868
Living in the woods
with all those filthy beasts.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.786
But look at me now.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.289
I've got a castle.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.376
I'll never go back. None of us ever will.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.713
To make sure of that, I'm going to
do what I always do...

34:09.880 --> 34:12.299
...when someone digs up a copy
of this tedious book.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.009
You promised I'd be sent home.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.136
Yes, I know. I lied when I said that.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.139
I mean, I'm a liar.
I lie all the time. Lie, lie, lie.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.141
After all these years,
you'd think he'd figure it out by now.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.395
- No!
- No!

34:26.313 --> 34:27.313
Get it! Get it out!

34:28.900 --> 34:30.567
No!

34:33.362 --> 34:36.739
Must you do that every single time?
It's pathetic, honestly.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.743
Don't!

34:43.498 --> 34:47.583
Now, get your burns tended to. Otherwise,
I'll be forced to cancel our Juggle Night.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.129
You know how much I look forward
to Juggle Night. Lock them up.

35:02.266 --> 35:06.853
Hey, Darius. Don't forget to feed
the crocodile, will you?

35:10.399 --> 35:12.025
Oh, for the love of Theseus!

35:16.531 --> 35:18.990
No, no, no. He didn't mean it.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.994
He's just hungry.
It's not his fault.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.329
He's a Minotaur.

35:24.497 --> 35:28.416
He can barely walk,
thanks to Darius and his reading.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.210
A lot is down to this jackass.

35:30.378 --> 35:34.172
We came out with half the book
tattooed across our face. Look at my eye.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.217
If you think that's bad,
look at the state of my nose.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.553
- It's disgusting.
- Ye... All right.

35:39.804 --> 35:43.140
So you can imagine how pleased we are
that you're here.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.644
Delighted. Because now we got someone
who can really read.

36:06.455 --> 36:08.373
I hurt myself.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.584
Again.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.841
I don't understand it.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.511
In Inkheart, my hands,
they never burned.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.180
But here!

36:26.017 --> 36:28.935
Fire has no sense of humor.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.612
You're trying to escape again?

36:38.988 --> 36:40.030
Resa...

36:40.865 --> 36:42.365
...give up.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.285
We're not going anywhere.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.959
For a moment...

36:54.795 --> 36:56.963
...I held Inkheart in my hands.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.843
But it's ashes now.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.349
And I shall never go home.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.563
But you...

37:14.148 --> 37:16.066
...you still have hope.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.745
When Darius read you out of Inkworld,
he left your voice behind in that book.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.622
But if you could talk...

37:30.790 --> 37:32.666
...would you tell me your story?

37:33.668 --> 37:35.168
Would you?

37:38.589 --> 37:39.965
No.

37:41.342 --> 37:45.262
No, you wouldn't. It's because of how
I'm written, isn't it?

37:45.429 --> 37:48.848
You think me weak and deceitful.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.645
It's not all I am.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.276
Not all of me.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.541
It's just a dream.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.835
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.503
Are you all right?

38:19.588 --> 38:22.257
- What's your name?
- My name is Farid.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.884
- Are you one of the 40 thieves?
- Stop talking to me.

38:25.052 --> 38:28.388
Don't you know it's bad luck
to speak in a dream? You stupid girl.

38:29.974 --> 38:33.560
You talk in a dream,
you never find your way back.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.145
"Stupid"?

38:35.563 --> 38:39.065
You're the one who thinks you're in
a dream. I was just trying to be nice.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.443
Go back to your muttering
and see if I care.

38:41.610 --> 38:44.404
It's just a dream. Just a dream.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.827
Come home.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.580
Please come home.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.088
Good morning.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.258
Thank you.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.053
How can I ever repay you?

39:10.931 --> 39:14.893
Resa, even if I could find you a key,
where would you go?

39:27.531 --> 39:28.948
This is your family?

39:34.622 --> 39:35.914
This is your husband?

39:38.125 --> 39:39.125
Your daughter?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.892
You went in the book when I came out.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.396
You went in the book...

39:59.563 --> 40:01.439
...when I came out...

40:02.691 --> 40:04.984
...and then Darius read you out again.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.569
Gwin.

40:11.992 --> 40:15.662
I'm gonna get you out of these chains,
and then you're going home.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.260
I'll meet you at the stables.

41:16.682 --> 41:19.058
I've never been that in control before.

41:20.769 --> 41:22.896
I know I can get Resa out of the book.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.732
And maybe send Capricorn back in.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.692
We just have to find another copy.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.695
Well, it only took you nine years
to find the last one.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.823
I bet the author has a copy.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.244
If he's alive, I bet he'd have one.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.622
Someone must know where he lives.

41:40.789 --> 41:44.417
Great. Now we're going to
have to try to escape, aren't we?

41:44.752 --> 41:47.587
Either that, or get fed
to the ticking crocodile next door.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.423
Someone has to stop him.

41:55.804 --> 41:58.306
Before you say anything,
I'm here to save your necks.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.893
After putting them on the chopping block
in the first place?

42:02.811 --> 42:07.315
Listen, you want your wife back
as much as I want to go home to my family.

42:07.483 --> 42:11.069
You think there's another copy
of Inkheart out there, let's find it together.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.655
And how do you intend that we escape?

42:16.575 --> 42:18.076
Page 14.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.579
The mighty storm?

42:23.123 --> 42:25.291
Get in the castle!
Let's go!

42:25.709 --> 42:28.795
<i>"From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...</i>

42:28.963 --> 42:30.964
<i>...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy
could see...</i>

42:31.131 --> 42:34.133
<i>...where the long grass bowed
in waves before the coming storm.</i>

42:35.386 --> 42:38.513
<i>'There's a cyclone coming, Em.
I'll go after the stock."'</i>

42:38.681 --> 42:41.057
Good doggies.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.936
<i>"Suddenly, Uncle Henry stood up."</i>

42:46.355 --> 42:48.147
Get out of the square!

42:48.482 --> 42:51.776
<i>"He ran toward the sheds where the cows
and the horses were kept.</i>

42:51.944 --> 42:54.028
<i>Aunt Em dropped her work
and came to the door.</i>

42:54.196 --> 42:56.614
<i>One glance told her
of the danger close at hand.</i>

42:56.782 --> 42:58.908
<i>'Quick, Dorothy! Run for the cellar!"'</i>

42:59.076 --> 43:00.493
There she is! Come on!

43:00.661 --> 43:02.078
<i>"A strange thing happened.</i>

43:02.788 --> 43:07.125
<i>The house whirled around two or three
times and rose slowly through the air.</i>

43:08.711 --> 43:12.171
<i>Dorothy felt as if
she were going up in a balloon."</i>

43:14.675 --> 43:15.800
That should do it!

43:19.471 --> 43:20.847
Let's get out of here!

43:25.519 --> 43:27.020
Must've run off!

43:33.277 --> 43:34.319
Help me!

43:52.379 --> 43:55.048
Come here! Let's go.

43:57.176 --> 43:59.344
Come on!
Straight on!

44:00.554 --> 44:02.555
- Come on!
Get them!

44:07.394 --> 44:09.062
Come on, get up!

44:23.994 --> 44:25.578
You were right.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.246
Mo!

44:27.790 --> 44:30.166
Gwin!
- Meggie!

44:31.627 --> 44:32.669
Meggie!

44:32.878 --> 44:35.421
Look! Hold on! Hold on! Wait, hold on!

44:36.882 --> 44:38.049
Don't move!

44:48.310 --> 44:49.769
Watch out!

44:55.275 --> 44:56.526
Dustfinger!

44:58.112 --> 44:59.612
Where are we going?

45:04.785 --> 45:07.120
Don't leave me!

45:09.957 --> 45:11.666
The prisoners!

45:12.126 --> 45:14.836
They're escaping!

45:20.884 --> 45:22.135
Run!

45:22.302 --> 45:23.761
Hurry, get in!
Run, run!

45:23.929 --> 45:25.638
Get in, get in!

45:30.352 --> 45:32.353
Get the keys, hurry up!
Take all the keys!

45:32.521 --> 45:34.522
Which one?
The one with the nine!

45:35.149 --> 45:37.233
Wait, wait, wait, Gwin!

45:38.485 --> 45:40.153
Come on, Gwin.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.071
Come on! Okay, go, go!

45:53.751 --> 45:55.168
Hold on!

46:01.633 --> 46:03.009
Watch out!

46:18.692 --> 46:20.193
Still think you're dreaming?

46:20.360 --> 46:21.861
Well, what else could it be?

46:22.529 --> 46:23.905
We're flying.

46:25.365 --> 46:28.534
Or is it the night flying past us?

46:32.539 --> 46:34.081
He lives in Alassio.

46:34.249 --> 46:35.583
Which way is that?

46:35.751 --> 46:40.004
South.
South? Can't you be more precise?

47:03.237 --> 47:04.403
Beats a camel, huh?

47:04.571 --> 47:05.655
Farid.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.406
Oh, hooligan.

47:07.574 --> 47:11.410
Farid, some clothes for you.
You'll freeze to death otherwise.

47:11.578 --> 47:12.912
Apparently this is the place.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.374
Man in the fishmonger's says he lives
in an apartment over the square.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.583
Good. Great.

47:18.377 --> 47:19.418
Oh, I'm not coming.

47:19.878 --> 47:22.922
What do you mean? You have to come,
otherwise he won't believe me.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.591
Oh, I don't know.
You can be pretty persuasive.

47:25.759 --> 47:27.552
Huh?
- You talked me out of a book.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.096
The book is right here within our grasp...

47:30.264 --> 47:31.764
You're afraid.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.769
You've never read Inkheart, have you?

47:37.271 --> 47:38.938
What's there to read?

47:39.606 --> 47:43.442
I've lived it. Except for the end,
and I've got no interest in that.

47:43.610 --> 47:44.610
Well, why not?

47:44.778 --> 47:47.196
Do you know the end
of your story, Meggie?

47:48.240 --> 47:50.449
No. And I suspect you wouldn't want to.

47:50.617 --> 47:54.579
It'd be like turning
to the last page of a mystery.

47:55.289 --> 47:58.916
- Where's the fun in that?
- Well, I think I know the end of my story.

47:59.918 --> 48:01.586
Hm?
- I'm going home.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.212
Why?

48:03.380 --> 48:05.631
I'm sorry. It's just all too real for me.

48:05.799 --> 48:09.760
I prefer a story that has the good sense
to stay on the page where it belongs.

48:09.928 --> 48:12.805
No, I have to get back to my
poor, desecrated books.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.849
I want to mend them, put them in order.

48:15.017 --> 48:18.019
- I'll do that. Let me...
- Here's some money for you.

48:18.186 --> 48:20.521
You see, I've already bought my ticket.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.523
Goodbye.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.442
Good luck.

48:32.826 --> 48:33.826
- Elinor...
- Let her go.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.119
Don't catch cold.

48:35.287 --> 48:36.829
Bye, then.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.672
Here it is. This must be it.

48:47.341 --> 48:48.758
That's it.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.302
What?

48:53.847 --> 48:56.015
- Signor Fenoglio?
- Yes?

48:56.850 --> 48:58.893
Sir, my name's Mortimer Folchart.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.227
- I'm Meggie.
- My daughter.

49:00.395 --> 49:02.521
- I want to be a writer too.
- You do?

49:02.689 --> 49:06.651
Yes. Give me something to write with.
Be quick, I've got a cake in the oven.

49:07.986 --> 49:09.737
You look like you've been taxidermied.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.782
- If you want an autograph, give me a pen.
- We don't want one.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.700
- You don't want an autograph?
- No.

49:14.868 --> 49:17.495
Then why in the name of Chaucer's beard
are you ringing?

49:17.663 --> 49:19.288
Well...

49:19.706 --> 49:23.042
Dustfinger's in the piazza, we just
escaped from Capricorn's village...

49:23.210 --> 49:25.628
...and you won't even believe
what Basta tried to do.

49:27.714 --> 49:29.048
What?

50:04.459 --> 50:05.501
Come home.

50:06.962 --> 50:09.130
Please, come home.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.340
A good story, I'll give you that.

50:11.508 --> 50:15.886
Silvertongues is a wonderful concept. Wish
I thought of it. Too absurd to take seriously.

50:16.054 --> 50:20.057
I know my characters are so believable
that they seem to leap off the page.

50:20.225 --> 50:22.351
But it's simply not possible.

50:31.611 --> 50:34.238
Exactly as I imagined him.

50:49.004 --> 50:51.630
This must be
what it feels like to give birth.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.300
Wait, where you going?
He doesn't want to meet.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.303
Of course he does.
I'm practically his father.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.430
Well, what was that at the end?

51:00.599 --> 51:01.891
It's called Dragon's Breath.

51:02.809 --> 51:04.602
You can teach to me?

51:07.689 --> 51:11.776
I'm sure that this must be very exciting
for you to meet your characters.

51:11.943 --> 51:15.071
But the purpose that we came here
was to find a way...

51:15.238 --> 51:16.822
...to get him back in the book.

51:16.990 --> 51:19.241
Your father's given me
an idea for a character.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.827
A master thief who steals things...

51:21.995 --> 51:25.498
...the way a blue jay swipes
shiny objects off window sills.

51:25.665 --> 51:27.333
I am not trying to steal them.

51:27.501 --> 51:31.670
You snatched them. You're trying to keep
them from me. That, my friend, is thievery.

51:31.838 --> 51:33.672
I'm just trying to get my wife back.

51:34.674 --> 51:35.674
- Dustfinger.
- I tried to stop him

51:35.842 --> 51:38.302
- So wonderful to meet you.
- Oh, no, no. No.

51:38.470 --> 51:41.180
The scars are perfect.
As hideous as I imagined.

51:41.348 --> 51:44.475
I told you, he's afraid.
But, oh, not me, I hope.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.186
He's afraid of what happens
at the end of the book.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.021
What do you mean? Because he dies?

51:50.190 --> 51:51.690
Oh, no.

51:53.068 --> 51:56.445
- Oh, I see. Right, I'm sorry.
- He dies in the end?

51:56.613 --> 52:00.407
I had to make the story exciting, it's my
job. They can't all have happy endings.

52:00.575 --> 52:02.701
Life doesn't always, after all.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.497
How's it happen?

52:06.665 --> 52:10.543
You're killed by one of Capricorn's men
while trying to save Gwin.

52:11.044 --> 52:14.213
It's a very touching death scene.
I cried when I wrote it.

52:14.714 --> 52:17.174
You think I care what you wrote?

52:18.718 --> 52:22.054
You don't control my fate.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.974
I'm not just some character
in your book...

52:25.142 --> 52:27.643
...and you...

52:27.811 --> 52:29.687
...you're not my god.

52:30.897 --> 52:34.150
Now, listen, old man...

52:34.317 --> 52:36.527
...do you have a copy
of the book or don't you?

52:36.695 --> 52:39.738
Because I would like
to go home now, please.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.785
The problem is it's been
out of print for decades.

52:44.953 --> 52:47.913
Plus, the original print run
was quite small.

52:48.081 --> 52:50.124
Then there was the fire
in the warehouse...

52:50.292 --> 52:52.543
...and the publishers
went out of business.

52:52.711 --> 52:55.004
This is gonna take forever.

52:58.258 --> 53:01.760
Stop it. This is no time to act foolishly.

53:05.182 --> 53:08.058
- Stop it.
- You're as sour as goat's urine.

53:08.894 --> 53:12.271
Thanks. And I don't want to know
how you know that.

53:12.939 --> 53:17.610
Look around. This garden is paradise.

53:17.777 --> 53:20.571
No slave drivers. No sandstorms.

53:21.072 --> 53:24.116
- No fleas.
- No peace and quiet.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.787
No, it's not that one either.

53:28.955 --> 53:30.497
I did hold on to a few copies...

53:30.665 --> 53:33.959
...but I loaned them to a book exhibition
in Genoa a few years ago...

53:34.127 --> 53:35.794
...and they were stolen.

53:35.962 --> 53:38.964
I suppose Capricorn
was behind the theft.

53:39.132 --> 53:42.301
At the time I assumed
it was just bad luck.

53:43.637 --> 53:45.804
- Ah! Here we are.
- What is it?

53:45.972 --> 53:49.725
The original manuscript. Look at that!
Typewritten, can you imagine?

53:49.893 --> 53:51.602
Grabbies.

53:52.604 --> 53:56.148
After all these years,
I still remember the characters.

53:57.567 --> 54:02.321
<i>The water nymphs in the Wayless Wood.</i>

54:07.452 --> 54:10.287
<i>And in the castles of Umbra...</i>

54:11.539 --> 54:12.831
<i>...the Black Prince.</i>

54:15.460 --> 54:16.502
<i>The Motley Folk.</i>

54:19.631 --> 54:21.840
<i>And of course you, Dustfinger.</i>

54:22.175 --> 54:23.467
<i>As well as the villains:</i>

54:24.386 --> 54:28.555
<i>The Adderhead,
Capricorn and the Fire Raisers.</i>

54:29.557 --> 54:32.977
And the worst of all, The Shadow.

54:41.987 --> 54:44.363
It's a wonderful book, I must say.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.366
I'd give anything to go into it myself.

54:47.534 --> 54:48.867
Well, get in line, old man.

54:49.035 --> 54:51.578
I've got page 209 to 447.
What do you got?

54:51.746 --> 54:52.788
I have the rest.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.748
All right. Need that.

54:55.041 --> 54:56.875
Now you can read me back, right?

54:57.043 --> 55:02.131
Well, I'll try to. But that's only after
I've read my wife out, and she's all right.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.216
It's the only way I'm gonna do it.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.136
- We might have a problem.
- What are you talking about?

55:07.762 --> 55:09.013
You can't read her out.

55:09.764 --> 55:10.806
Why?

55:11.766 --> 55:13.559
Because she's not in the book.

55:14.644 --> 55:16.729
What are you not telling me?
I've seen her.

55:16.896 --> 55:20.065
She's not actually in the book anymore.

55:20.233 --> 55:21.734
- She's...
Where?

55:21.901 --> 55:24.236
She's in Capricorn's village.
Darius read her out.

55:24.404 --> 55:27.114
- She's alive?
- We were just there and you didn't tell me!

55:27.282 --> 55:29.325
- We need the book.
- We didn't need the book!

55:29.492 --> 55:30.743
I needed the book!

55:30.910 --> 55:32.870
My mum was there
and you didn't tell us?

55:33.663 --> 55:35.748
Listen...
Yeah, don't look at me like that...

55:35.915 --> 55:39.168
...because if your Dad knew the truth,
he wouldn't have helped me...

55:39.336 --> 55:40.544
...and I need the book.

55:40.712 --> 55:44.840
- Selfish, repugnant, weak character!
- Blame him, he wrote me that way.

55:45.008 --> 55:47.426
- I disagree.
- You tell me how to find her!

55:47.594 --> 55:49.553
Not until you promise to read me back.

55:49.721 --> 55:53.849
- Tell me how to find my wife.
- I miss my family too.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.025
All right.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.777
Promise.

56:06.321 --> 56:07.363
I promise.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.910
I want to help save Mum too.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.245
- Take me with you.
- You know I can't do that.

56:15.413 --> 56:16.455
But I can help.

56:16.623 --> 56:21.377
You can help by staying here and
being safe. That's what you can do.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.295
You don't know what I can do.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.093
And neither do I.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.720
Meggie, will you please...?

56:37.519 --> 56:40.270
Okay, come on. You got to stay here.

56:49.531 --> 56:51.657
- Thanks very much. Take care of Meggie.
- Yes.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.618
- And Farid as well.
- What?

56:54.786 --> 56:57.329
- Take care of Farid as well.
- Of course.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.748
Why can't I come too? It's my car.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.794
Sweetheart.

57:07.173 --> 57:09.049
Just bring her back.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.135
I will.

57:17.517 --> 57:22.062
Reduced to babysitting. Marvelous.

57:34.534 --> 57:37.703
Hurry up, we'll miss the train.
How long will it take to get there?

57:37.871 --> 57:39.371
Not very long. Come on.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.540
Can I sit next to you, Mum?
Me too.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.375
I'll sit in the middle.

58:06.024 --> 58:10.903
<i>"That just happened,"
said Dorothy, simply. "I could not help it."</i>

58:15.116 --> 58:17.451
<i>You have no right to...</i>

58:22.707 --> 58:25.918
<i>"If you wish me to use my magic powers
to send you home...</i>

58:26.377 --> 58:28.420
<i>...you must do something for me first.</i>

58:29.255 --> 58:32.174
<i>Help me and I will help you."</i>

58:33.885 --> 58:36.053
<i>"What must I do?" said the girl.</i>

58:36.596 --> 58:39.473
<i>"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West."</i>

58:53.112 --> 58:55.864
<i>"From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...</i>

58:56.032 --> 58:59.284
...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see
where the long grass bowed...

58:59.452 --> 59:00.911
...before the coming storm."

59:11.256 --> 59:13.924
"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh.

59:14.509 --> 59:17.010
He was a little black dog
with long silky hair...

59:17.178 --> 59:21.807
...and small black eyes that twinkled merrily
on either side of his funny wee nose."

59:24.561 --> 59:27.813
Toto? Oh, Toto, don't be scared.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.982
You're just not in Kansas anymore.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.859
Oh, Toto.

59:35.655 --> 59:37.948
Toto, come out from under there.

59:38.157 --> 59:39.366
You're gonna get me in trouble.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.078
It's me. Open the door.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.663
Just a minute.

59:45.832 --> 59:49.042
And not another sound. I mean it.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.635
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

59:58.803 --> 01:00:00.512
But, look, it's Basta.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:05.142
And I'm sorry, but I'm afraid all the
henchmen blend into one, even to me.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:10.022
- Hello, princess. Where's your father?
- Told him he'd gone, but they don't believe.

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:12.733
- You told them?
- He held a knife to my throat.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.694
Isn't he awful?
And they don't believe I'm the author.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:19.197
Tell us where Silvertongue is
before I kill you both.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.034
Toto, no!

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.536
Toto?

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.956
Oh, my goodness!

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.209
She's inherited her father's gift.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:35.922
Another Silvertongue.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.300
Old Capricorn will be pleased.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.388
Bring them both.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:55.067
So if Darius read her out of the book...

01:00:55.234 --> 01:00:58.070
Oh, no, no, no. She's fine.

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:00.864
- Mostly. She...
- Mostly?

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.076
She's got no voice.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.246
- What?
- He read her out last spring...

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:10.916
...and she has no voice.

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:14.419
But apart from that, she's fine.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.012
- Pull over.
- For what?

01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:28.433
- Just pull over.
- That makes sense, you speaking weasel.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.943
I thought I told you to stay
with the old man.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.736
But he's mean.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.322
Not as mean as Capricorn.

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:46.910
He doesn't scare me.
I was raised by murderers and thieves.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.704
Well, he should scare you.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.875
- I should make you walk back.
- I'd only follow you.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.467
Get in.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:04.553
After this, you teach me Dragon's Breath...

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.805
Just get in the car.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.149
Hello, Mr. Fenoglio?

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.855
These guys are just
circling the perimeter.

01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:59.107
We should move in now.

01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:00.984
When we get to maid's quarters...

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.154
...Resa's room is the third door
on the right when we go in back.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:07.199
I'll go in the back. You guys cover me.

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.706
All right, this is our way in.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:18.877
Now, listen, this is going to be dangerous
so you need to keep up.

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.879
Got to move quickly.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.181
After you.

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:42.818
Shall we rest?

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:48.240
No, that's okay. Just keep moving.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.244
- Kids.
- No, I'm fine.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.999
What was that?
Where?

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.043
There!

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:01.503
- Over there!
Shoot him!

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.089
- Bring him down!
Thanks.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:09.219
They're there behind the square.
Oh, no.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.929
Well, come on. Quick.

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.978
Hurry! Go on!
Head him off at the square!

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.024
Don't let him get away!

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.009
Look. Look at this.
Look at the Dragon's Breath.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.303
I think I got it. Here, feel my hand.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.850
It's been too long.
I'm going to see if he's all right.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:41.186
Come on.
We'll find him.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.981
He's not far away.

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:50.195
- Well done. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:00.455
Look who's back. This is nice.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.293
Just in time for your execution.

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:12.842
All right.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.723
Capricorn's castle is like a five-star hotel.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:21.559
Not for you, obviously.
You'll be locked in the crypt.

01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:25.271
But some of our guests
get a room with a view.

01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:31.194
Resa.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:32.654
Sorry.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.407
Listen, your husband's here.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:38.159
He's come to rescue you.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.558
That way! That way!

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.696
There!

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.989
Come on!

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.282
What happened?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.451
They're going to kill Dustfinger.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.288
Here.
- They're going to kill him and it's my fault.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.789
No, it's not. What happened?

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.712
All the letters of the alphabet.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.714
It looks just like my book.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.300
It's like walking into
my own imagination.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.844
I wonder what Capricorn's
going to make you read.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.637
I hope it's something good.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:42.390
I'm excited, I am. Are you, eh?

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.479
<i>"'What raft, Jim? ' 'Our old raft.'</i>

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:50.607
<i>'You mean to say our old raft
wasn't smashed all to flinders?"'</i>

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:08.083
I'm convinced.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.463
Though I don't know what that poor boy
will do without his raft.

01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:18.343
- No.
- I'm tired of doing stupid tricks for you.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:19.844
Tell me where my father is.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:22.846
I have absolutely no idea.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.935
Quite frankly, I don't care, because
you read just as well as he does.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.443
What are you gawking at?

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:37.862
You're just as I wrote you.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:39.697
A cowardly thug.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:42.367
How dare you.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.620
You'll pay for your filthy story!

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.710
Only the king can pull it out.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:55.546
Don't you remember?

01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:00.135
Don't you ever laugh at me.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.723
Get it away from me. I want it
executed with the others.

01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:09.394
The dog? You want the dog executed?

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:14.899
As for you, we'll see how you enamored
of your creations you are...

01:09:15.067 --> 01:09:17.902
...when The Shadow
is flaying the skin off your back.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:22.240
You can't bring it out of the book.
You burnt the last copy. I saw you do it.

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:26.578
Wrong.

01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:30.081
I saved a copy of the book for myself.

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:32.000
Aren't I full of surprises?

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:43.094
No, I couldn't burn them all, could I?

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:46.430
Not with my old friend trapped inside.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.265
Oh, you are going to love him.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:53.563
And by love,
I mean cower in terror from.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.274
You see, I love this world...

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.694
...and I intend to write my name
on every page of it.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.404
You...

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.115
...and The Shadow are going to help me
do just that.

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:09.621
I won't read anything for you.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:11.956
Oh, really?

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:18.922
Let me show you what happens
to those who disobey me around here.

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:22.217
She's been very naughty, this one.

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:25.136
Tiresome in the extreme.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.638
Always trying to escape.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.890
So I'm putting an end to it.

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:33.019
- Meggie.
- Mum.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.148
It's you.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.945
Mo's here. We're going to get out.
We're going to escape. We'll all escape.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.863
Well...

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:50.954
...what a touching display of empathy.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.872
"Mum."

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.125
Look at me.

01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:03.174
Yes, I can see the resemblance.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.806
Do you still think I can't convince you
to read for me?

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.855
No! Mum! Mum!

01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:20.692
Please! Please!

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.739
Meggie!

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.953
Is it too late to make any changes?

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.121
Changes?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.000
Just thinking perhaps you might be able
to add a few lines, you know what I mean?

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:39.877
I don't need to be some great beauty,
or anything.

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.879
I don't know if you noticed my nose.

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.840
Oh, your nose. Yes, right.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:46.884
Think you could do that?
Rewrite things, change things a bit.

01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:50.388
I don't know. It's a wonderful idea.

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:54.934
Move.

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:03.234
- What are you doing? Get off me.
- You can't go down there.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.070
- They have my daughter.
- They kill her if you do anything.

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:09.782
- I should never have left her alone.
- We have to stay hidden.

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:22.754
Nothing to be frightened of.
It's just dusty old coffins.

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:26.966
If there are any nasty spirits down here,
it's not us they're angry at.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:31.971
Princess needs to rest
that voice of hers for tonight.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:49.614
I've seen my mum. She's a prisoner here.

01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:51.616
I know.

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.286
Have you seen my dad?

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.621
Yeah, he's fine.

01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:00.416
Capricorn's got another copy
of the book.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.171
He's gonna make me
read The Shadow out of it.

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.300
I have Mo's gift.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.302
I can do it.

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.680
Well, then you could read me back.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.141
"One moonlit night...

01:13:17.309 --> 01:13:21.104
...The Shadow
turned on his despicable..."

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:26.859
Make him kill Capricorn.

01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:28.986
Make The Shadow do it.

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:32.323
Food for the little princess.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:38.496
Capricorn wants you to have
your strength for tonight.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:40.832
You should stay.
We're telling ghost stories.

01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:43.835
Right. You don't like
ghost stories, do you?

01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:46.003
I'll give you ghost stories, you...!

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:51.843
Get it off of me!

01:13:58.058 --> 01:13:59.350
My pouch!

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:02.603
You don't have your good luck charm.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:03.896
Give me that back!

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:05.940
Why don't you come in and get it?

01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:09.360
What are you doing?

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.864
Someone's got to get us out,
and I don't think it'll be the writer.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.367
You give that back to me.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.785
You be careful.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.289
Maybe I don't need my good luck.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.458
Time to finish what we started.

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:33.217
By the bones of the dead man
in this coffin, I curse you.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.720
Don't you say that. Take that back!

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:39.056
May his spirit haunt your every step.

01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:40.224
You take that back!

01:14:50.235 --> 01:14:52.737
Open this gate.
Hurry up. Quickly.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.197
- Open the gate.
Come on.

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:55.781
Let me out.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:00.244
- Which one?
- Help! The prisoners are escaping!

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.163
The fire! Use your fire!

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.248
Come on, hurry up.

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:08.544
Help! The prisoners are escaping!

01:15:09.379 --> 01:15:11.214
The prisoners are escaping!

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.423
Come on!

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.300
Come on.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:16.844
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.721
Help! Quick!

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:19.931
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:22.892
- I can't, I'm sorry.
- Stay!

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.101
Don't go.

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:27.271
You don't have to be selfish
just because that's how I wrote you!

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.774
You're more than that!
You said so yourself!

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.234
Stay and help us!

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.450
Help!

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.663
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:54.966
Check all the courtyards!

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:56.300
Let me out!

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.993
Don't leave! Come back!

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:25.329
Oh, God.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:34.505
This is quite possibly the most stupid thing
you've ever done in your life, Elinor.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.008
There are a bunch of
murderous thugs up there.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:40.136
You think you're going to just walk in
and tell them what to do?

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.263
Very likely to listen to you, aren't they?

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.308
Silly old bookworm
with your head in the clouds.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.531
- Thank you.
- You're alive.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.199
Thank you.

01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:05.036
All right. All right.
All right, that's enough.

01:17:05.203 --> 01:17:07.371
Did you find them?
Resa, Meggie, how are they?

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:08.873
- They're fine.
- Good.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.374
For now.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.961
- But Capricorn has a copy of the book.
- He what?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.547
He kept one secretly.

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:22.219
That was always his plan,
to have The Shadow read out of the book.

01:17:23.221 --> 01:17:27.058
I can't read The Shadow out.
That would kill us all.

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:28.893
He doesn't need you anymore.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.521
He found someone else.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.398
Meggie.

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:35.983
Meggie?

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:50.164
Having writer's block?

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:52.750
Maybe I can help.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.503
Yeah, that's right.
You want to be a writer, don't you?

01:17:55.671 --> 01:18:00.466
- You say that as if it's a bad thing.
- No, no. Just a lonely thing.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.259
The world you create on the page...

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:05.221
...seems more friendly and alive
than the world you live in.

01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:07.682
And you wish you could be there instead.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.560
You're a clever girl, Meggie.

01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:15.272
I couldn't have hoped for a finer young
lady to be shut up in a crypt with...

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.858
...whilst awaiting my execution.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:22.446
Now, I haven't really got
what I need yet...

01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:24.031
...but it's very close.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.414
Come on, feed us.

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:35.126
Blast, they're early. Why are they early?
This is most inconvenient.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.963
Put one here somewhere. The words
have to be perfect or it won't work.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:43.259
<i>They have to be written by the writer.
It has to sound like Inkheart.</i>

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.720
Ah. Here it is.

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:49.765
Here what is?

01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:52.143
Something for her to
remember me by after I'm gone.

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:58.566
I don't think much
of your crude scribblings, old man.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.486
Well, you are my crude scribblings,
Magpie...

01:19:02.654 --> 01:19:05.281
...so I'd be careful
what I scrumple up if I were you.

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:08.993
- Where are you taking her?
- To put on her party frock.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.496
Oh, don't worry, you're invited
to the feast as well.

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:15.833
We wouldn't eat without you.
In fact, you're the main course.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.962
The Shadow will be feeding on you
and that maid later tonight...

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:24.049
...so rest assured
somebody will be back to fetch you.

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:32.558
You wanted to be alone,
didn't you? Well, here you are.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.268
Alone in the wilderness.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.979
Mosquito bites and blisters and...

01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:40.024
Oh, God.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:43.736
And do you have a plan? No, no plan.

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:47.031
Just rent a motorbike, find a map.

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.200
We'll figure it out when we get there.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.370
- This is the plan.
- Good.

01:19:53.538 --> 01:19:57.208
- You use your fire and create a distraction.
- I can set fire to the castle.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.667
I can help too.

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.544
Don't get in my way.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.215
When Capricorn's men
try to put the fire out...

01:20:04.716 --> 01:20:08.469
...I move in, I rescue Meggie and Resa.
- But we're outnumbered.

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.055
- And they have these...
- Guns.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:14.350
That's why we disguise ourselves
as Black Jackets. Let's go.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:18.395
Well, come on, then.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:27.571
This really is a beautiful little village.

01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:31.742
But it'll be nice to have something
a bit bigger.

01:20:32.577 --> 01:20:34.370
Stretch out.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.915
Expand my kingdom's borders.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.960
That's why I need The Shadow.

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:43.879
And I don't want anyone else escaping.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:21:01.021
If you don't stop shaking,
I'm going to stick you with a pin.

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:09.154
Do you honestly expect me to read
an entire army out of this book?

01:21:09.322 --> 01:21:11.615
- Do you have a better idea?
- No.

01:21:11.783 --> 01:21:12.950
Thought not.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.169
Get a move on.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.630
Go on.

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:30.467
Yes.

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.511
Come on! Come on!

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:43.981
Go on.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.450
Forward.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:01.290
Don't try anything funny
or you'll never see your mother alive again.

01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:06.420
Please.

01:22:08.506 --> 01:22:14.136
The time has come to be reunited
with our old friend!

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.537
Well, tie them up, then.

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:46.460
Good evening.

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:49.546
Do you want to get out of here?

01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:53.550
Then you're going to have to help me.

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.686
<i>Inkheart! Inkheart! Inkheart!</i>

01:23:03.853 --> 01:23:05.312
Read it!

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:07.982
Read the words!

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.027
<i>Inkheart!</i>

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:16.991
Say the words!

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.084
You're very good at that.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:33.173
Doesn't mean we're friends or anything.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.387
Read it!
Read it!

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:40.097
<i>Inkheart!</i>

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:44.893
Read it!

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:48.689
I got it. Here.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:53.402
"Capricorn led an army of brutal men...

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:58.407
...who struck fear in the hearts and minds
of all those they came in contact with.

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:01.952
- Whenever they passed by...
- Resa.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.622
...people closed their doors
and hid with their children.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.388
But of all the villains
lurking in the Wayless Wood...

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:26.435
...the one most feared and reviled
was known simply as The Shadow."

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.229
The Shadow.

01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:33.650
"Made from the ashes
of Capricorn's victims...

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:36.320
...The Shadow
was immortal and invulnerable...

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:39.782
...and as pitiless as his master.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.828
His fingers and even his breath
brought death...

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:48.332
...scenting his way
like a hound on the trail."

01:24:59.552 --> 01:25:02.012
"He appears only
when Capricorn calls him...

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.848
...rising from the ground,
a faceless and fiery beast.

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:08.102
- No. Stop reading. Stop.
- Always eager to consume his next victim."

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:13.816
Stop reading, Meggie.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.860
Meggie, stop reading!

01:25:58.236 --> 01:25:59.319
Beautiful.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:04.533
Feast.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.288
Mum!

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.417
Shadow!

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:17.004
- Shadow!
Toto! Good boy.

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:25.554
Mum!

01:26:26.472 --> 01:26:27.514
Feast.

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:37.608
"Yet one starlit night,
The Shadow heard a different voice.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:40.944
The voice of a girl, and when
she called his name, he remembered."

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:42.154
Take that book!

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:45.032
"He remembered all those
from whose ashes he was made.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.576
All the pain and all the grief.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:51.371
The Shadow remembered,
and he was determined to take revenge.

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:55.417
Revenge on those whose cruelty
was the cause of all this misfortune."

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:57.961
- Make her stop.
- "Shadow went to his master...

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:01.131
...and reached out to him
with ashen hands."

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.636
That's not right!
Take it away!

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.809
That's not the book.
Those aren't the real words.

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:15.812
Stop her. Somebody stop her reading!

01:27:16.814 --> 01:27:18.649
- Stop her!
Meggie, watch out!

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:20.740
Mo!

01:27:22.922 --> 01:27:23.922
Mo!

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:28.158
- Give that here!
Give it back!

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.292
What a pleasant turn of events.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:45.342
Silvertongue,
you're just in time for dinner!

01:27:53.893 --> 01:27:55.352
No!

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:58.021
Not my castle!

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:02.740
Attack!

01:28:06.092 --> 01:28:09.000
A-t-tack!

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:17.958
- Get off!
Get out of my way!

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:25.007
Resa.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.552
No! Get off!

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.053
What...! No!

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.730
You think these misfits can conquer me?

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.357
Go! Devour her!

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.987
- You'll have to get past me first!
- Watch out, Mo!

01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:50.407
Just keep reading!

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:51.992
What?
Keep reading!

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.286
I can't! There's nothing left to read.

01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:56.747
Then write.

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:06.715
Come on, Meggie!

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.842
You can do it!

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.553
The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.263
Come on, Meggie.

01:29:18.227 --> 01:29:20.562
"The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.

01:29:23.107 --> 01:29:27.194
And back to the evil master
who had controlled him all these years.

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:34.785
The Shadow reached out to him
with ashen hands.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.624
And as it did, Capricorn began to crackle
and fade like the old page of a book...

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:44.878
...growing transparent
and thin as paper."

01:29:47.298 --> 01:29:49.132
I won't let you!

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:53.303
Dad!

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.060
"Capricorn's ink-black soul
filled with terror...

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:02.312
...as he saw the end was near.

01:30:03.314 --> 01:30:06.900
And so, too, did the souls of all those
within The Shadow's gaze...

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.277
...who'd committed villainy
in Capricorn's name.

01:30:09.445 --> 01:30:12.906
And then they blew away,
like ashes in the wind."

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.160
Stop! Help!

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.336
No!

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.600
"While the terrible monster himself
disintegrated and was no more."

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.248
It's Meggie. She's reading.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:06.668
They're going back into their books.
I'm going to miss it!

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:09.379
I don't want to go back
into my stinking book.

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.884
"Those who'd been summoned against
their will, who were in sight of the girl...

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.471
...were set free, and set right
and sent back from whence they came."

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:24.561
Mo. Mo!

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:32.903
Toto?

01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:37.741
Meggie!

01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:41.495
Please, set me free.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:44.039
"And the old creator
finally got his wish...

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:46.875
...disappearing into the world
he had only dreamed about.

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:56.718
And then, finally, after what seemed
almost a lifetime of wishing...

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.764
...the young girl finally got
her most heartfelt dream.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:04.643
While the mother she knew she'd see
again and the father she cherished...

01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:08.939
- Meggie.
...came running to embrace their only..."

01:32:15.738 --> 01:32:17.781
Darling, I missed you.

01:32:24.121 --> 01:32:25.121
What happened?

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:27.249
I missed it.

01:32:29.126 --> 01:32:30.794
I missed it. They're all gone.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:34.130
I got here too late to go home.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:37.300
He'll never read me back in now.

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:40.554
He said he'd try.
After he got his wife back.

01:32:42.139 --> 01:32:46.142
Well, he won't.
He'd never risk losing her again.

01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:57.153
And I wouldn't make him.

01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:04.953
Stop it, Elinor.
It's so silly to cry at happy endings.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.621
Come here.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.131
Dustfinger.

01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:20.135
Dustfinger?

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:24.347
Let's go. Come on, it's time to go.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.143
- Let's run. Come on. Meggie.
- Meggie, quickly. Come on.

01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:29.644
The book's gone.

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:33.148
- We don't need it.
- Great. I'll have nightmares for weeks.

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:35.358
Come on.
Come on.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:41.990
You're all right?

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.024
You were going to leave without me?

01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:17.734
Oh, no.

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:21.905
- You're better off with them.
- Well, if you're going...

01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:24.658
...you should probably
bring this with you.

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:38.088
You stole this?

01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:41.758
I learned from the best.
I thought maybe we could find someone.

01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:45.428
Another reader.
Someone who could send you back.

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.432
What about that girl?

01:34:50.267 --> 01:34:54.187
You like her, don't you? You come
with me, you may never see her again.

01:34:55.147 --> 01:34:58.900
I stole photo from Silvertongue's pocket.

01:35:06.283 --> 01:35:11.496
Well, if I'm going to be
saddled with you...

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:13.456
...you can make yourself useful.

01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:17.627
We got a long walk ahead of us.

01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:23.133
Dustfinger.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.305
Dustfinger!

01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:35.478
I promised.

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:38.565
It's your turn now.

01:35:39.024 --> 01:35:40.483
Great.

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:53.037
You sure you want this? You remember
what happens at the end of the book.

01:35:53.205 --> 01:35:56.499
It's like I told the writer.
He doesn't control me.

01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:58.960
My fate's in my own hands now.

01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:03.256
Good luck.

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:07.927
Hey, don't take this the wrong way,
but don't come back, okay?

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:13.683
Do it.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.769
"It had been many years...

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:20.064
...since Dustfinger had set eyes
on the rolling meadows and the old mill.

01:36:21.066 --> 01:36:24.194
But it was even more beautiful
than he remembered.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:27.697
The butterflies flitted above the grass..."

01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:59.938
He's gone back.

01:37:00.397 --> 01:37:01.564
Where he wants to be.

01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:03.316
What about you?

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:05.735
I can't follow him.

01:37:07.738 --> 01:37:11.074
Because I've kept Gwin behind,
the end of his story will be different.

01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:12.909
He's not going to die.

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:15.411
You can stay with us.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.415
It was Mum's idea.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:22.252
Sorry. Shouldn't I have said that?

01:37:24.463 --> 01:37:26.923
Just don't expect me to read you back.

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.426
- You can teach me to read?
- Yeah.

01:37:30.594 --> 01:37:32.095
Maybe.

01:37:35.057 --> 01:37:36.891
I can teach you Dragon's Breath.

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:05.795
Roxanne!

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:08.840
Roxanne.
