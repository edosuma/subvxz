WEBVTT

00:11.632 --> 00:13.668
-Mom's freaking out
about tomorrow.

00:13.703 --> 00:15.463
-Well, after the past two
full moons, can you

00:15.498 --> 00:18.052
really blame her?

00:18.087 --> 00:19.536
-Oy.

00:19.571 --> 00:21.573
-Not my fault you're slow.

00:21.607 --> 00:22.746
-Not my fault you're a girl.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.580
-Look, we've got to
be there by 5:00.

00:28.614 --> 00:30.202
-That's hours till moonrise.

00:30.237 --> 00:31.652
-Yeah.

00:31.686 --> 00:34.586
Well, they don't want to take
any chances this time.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.312
-Smith goes for the shot.

00:36.346 --> 00:38.417
But it's blocked by Morris.

00:38.452 --> 00:39.832
Morris lines up.

00:39.867 --> 00:41.317
Oh, he misses!

00:41.351 --> 00:43.077
Complete embarrassment for
the boy from Wales.

00:43.112 --> 00:45.390
I mean, he's had a
terrible sea--

00:45.424 --> 00:48.255
no for Morris.

00:48.289 --> 00:49.704
-Hi.

00:49.739 --> 00:52.466
My dad's cooking tonight, so
I was thinking burgers at

00:52.500 --> 00:53.812
Bernie's instead.

00:53.846 --> 00:54.744
-I'm there.

00:54.778 --> 00:56.194
-5:30ish?

00:56.228 --> 00:57.091
-Yeah.

00:57.126 --> 00:58.437
Great.

00:58.472 --> 00:59.197
We'll be there.

00:59.231 --> 01:00.094
Won't we, Rhydian?

01:00.129 --> 01:01.509
-Where else would we be?

01:01.544 --> 01:02.717
-Great.

01:05.375 --> 01:08.482
THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

01:08.516 --> 01:09.448
never speak.

01:09.483 --> 01:12.900
To my grave the secret goes.

01:12.934 --> 01:15.799
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:15.834 --> 01:17.732
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:17.767 --> 01:22.116
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:22.151 --> 01:26.362
A change will come I know
behold my future.

01:26.396 --> 01:30.642
A promise that I keep, I'll
never share, I'll never speak.

01:30.676 --> 01:33.955
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:36.510 --> 01:40.307
-You do know Bernie's
doesn't allow dogs.

01:40.341 --> 01:41.825
-I panicked.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.207
The only thing I could think of
was, sorry, we'll be locked

01:44.242 --> 01:46.313
in the cellar turning
into wolves.

01:46.347 --> 01:48.591
-You should probably work
on your excuses.

01:48.625 --> 01:51.214
-I can't just make up
lies on the spot.

01:54.873 --> 01:55.943
-Why is my experiment
a different

01:55.977 --> 01:57.600
color to everyone else's?

01:57.634 --> 02:01.466
-Probably because you're right
and everyone else is wrong.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.674
-Listen.

02:02.708 --> 02:03.537
Maddy was just saying
how she's not going

02:03.571 --> 02:06.540
to make it out tonight.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.782
-Why?

02:08.818 --> 02:14.927
-Because I just remembered I
have to stay in and help mom

02:14.962 --> 02:17.516
with curtains.

02:17.551 --> 02:18.414
-Curtains?

02:18.448 --> 02:19.553
-Yeah.

02:19.587 --> 02:21.486
She's really into craft
all of a sudden.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.179
I said I'd hold them
while she sews.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.525
-Well, can't she do
it another time?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.217
-She's got a deadline.

02:28.251 --> 02:30.391
Sorry.

02:30.426 --> 02:32.531
-Oh.

02:32.566 --> 02:33.705
OK.

02:35.707 --> 02:36.846
-See?

02:36.880 --> 02:38.019
You can do it.

02:42.679 --> 02:44.612
-Finally.

02:44.647 --> 02:45.406
-We're early.

02:45.441 --> 02:46.407
-Just.

02:46.442 --> 02:47.408
-We came straight from school.

02:47.443 --> 02:48.892
It just seems to take longer.

02:48.927 --> 02:49.997
-Yeah, I know.

02:50.031 --> 02:51.619
Too much to see, too
much to smell.

02:54.415 --> 02:56.452
-Where did that hair
come from?

02:56.486 --> 02:57.384
-Where?

02:57.418 --> 02:58.039
-There.

02:58.074 --> 02:59.006
That black thing.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.352
[gasp]

03:00.387 --> 03:02.527
There's another one.
[SARCASTICALLY] Oh wait.

03:02.561 --> 03:03.631
It's a full moon.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.046
I must be turning
into the beast.

03:05.081 --> 03:05.633
[laughter]

03:05.668 --> 03:06.876
-Yeah.

03:06.910 --> 03:07.739
That moustache could
do with a trim too.

03:11.605 --> 03:12.882
-I can see so much--

03:12.916 --> 03:13.710
-Shh.

03:13.745 --> 03:15.643
[phone ringing]

03:15.678 --> 03:16.368
-Rhydian.

03:16.403 --> 03:17.749
-Listen, mate.

03:17.783 --> 03:20.303
I've got a bit of a vomiting
situation with my, uh,

03:20.338 --> 03:21.546
substitute parents.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.341
They're throwing up everywhere.

03:23.375 --> 03:23.962
-Oh.

03:23.996 --> 03:24.721
-Yeah.

03:24.756 --> 03:25.550
You know, I'm on--

03:25.584 --> 03:26.827
I'm on bucket duty.

03:26.861 --> 03:27.793
So I'm not going to be
able to make it out.

03:27.828 --> 03:28.415
-Oh, OK.

03:28.449 --> 03:29.001
Well--

03:29.036 --> 03:30.934
-[retching]

03:30.969 --> 03:32.867
-Oh, there she blows.

03:32.902 --> 03:33.420
All right.

03:33.454 --> 03:33.972
Uh, I--

03:34.006 --> 03:34.662
I got to go.

03:34.697 --> 03:38.390
[applause]

03:38.425 --> 03:39.805
-No Rhydian?

03:39.840 --> 03:40.772
[sigh]

03:40.806 --> 03:42.808
What is it with everyone
today?

03:42.843 --> 03:44.016
-Must be the full moon.

03:50.644 --> 03:53.543
-You know, we don't
have to do this.

03:53.578 --> 03:54.406
-What?

03:54.441 --> 03:55.856
-Stay here.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.410
I don't care how your parents
try and justify this.

03:58.445 --> 04:00.343
It's still a cage.

04:00.378 --> 04:01.724
It's still unnatural.

04:01.758 --> 04:02.518
-We agreed.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.036
We promised.

04:04.071 --> 04:05.624
I thought you were
OK with that.

04:05.659 --> 04:06.901
-Yeah.

04:06.936 --> 04:08.317
That was when the war seemed
a long way away.

04:08.351 --> 04:10.353
Now, I mean, this room
feels half the

04:10.388 --> 04:11.630
size it normally does.

04:11.665 --> 04:13.356
-I know what you mean.

04:13.391 --> 04:15.358
-It was fun though,
last full moon.

04:15.393 --> 04:16.428
-Yeah.

04:16.463 --> 04:18.982
-Out there, all of
us together.

04:19.017 --> 04:19.880
-It was--

04:19.914 --> 04:20.950
it was a rush.

04:20.983 --> 04:21.675
It was--

04:21.709 --> 04:22.538
-It was right.

04:22.572 --> 04:24.056
I mean, it was right.

04:24.091 --> 04:29.545
Outside in a pack, it's
where we belong.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.685
-The only reason we transformed
outside last time

04:31.719 --> 04:33.618
is because we've run
out of time.

04:33.652 --> 04:35.999
Mom and Dad, they won't
let that happen again.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.967
-They can't stop us if
we don't let them.

04:38.001 --> 04:40.452
-Rhydian, I won't
go against them.

04:42.937 --> 04:45.837
We stay.

04:45.871 --> 04:47.770
[music playing]

04:57.849 --> 04:59.333
-Is Shannon Kelly here?

05:08.963 --> 05:10.171
Kyle Weathers.

05:10.206 --> 05:12.173
I've come a long way
to find you.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.486
-Thanks.

05:14.521 --> 05:15.176
This is Tom.

05:15.211 --> 05:19.353
-Tom, good to meet you.

05:19.388 --> 05:21.873
-Hi.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.046
-We're short on daylight,
so I'll come

05:23.081 --> 05:24.531
straight to the point.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.464
The beast is in my sights,
and you're the girl to

05:26.498 --> 05:27.430
help me find it.

05:27.465 --> 05:28.880
-Excuse me?

05:28.914 --> 05:30.744
-I've been monitoring your blog
for the last six months.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.124
Your findings are pretty
compelling.

05:32.159 --> 05:33.885
-Why didn't you leave
any comments?

05:33.919 --> 05:36.059
-And open myself up to replies
from fools with no brains and

05:36.094 --> 05:38.855
even less imagination?

05:38.890 --> 05:41.099
-I know exactly what you mean.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.652
-Right.

05:42.687 --> 05:43.964
I'm searching the woods tonight,
and I need an expert.

05:43.998 --> 05:44.896
What do you say?

05:44.930 --> 05:46.104
-Tell me more.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.073
-Don't worry.

05:50.108 --> 05:51.074
No one can get in.

05:51.109 --> 05:52.524
And we're not getting out.

05:52.559 --> 05:54.733
We are going nowhere--

05:54.768 --> 05:56.459
until we've got fingers
again, obviously.

05:56.494 --> 05:57.909
-Great.

05:57.943 --> 05:59.013
You've done a really good job.

05:59.048 --> 06:02.569
It's very secure.

06:02.603 --> 06:03.224
-Thanks.

06:03.259 --> 06:04.502
And don't worry.

06:04.536 --> 06:05.744
It unlocks just as easy
as it unlocks.

06:08.195 --> 06:11.612
Oh no.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.545
Ah.

06:13.580 --> 06:14.512
Kidding.

06:14.546 --> 06:15.547
I'm kidding.

06:15.582 --> 06:16.721
It's just--

06:24.556 --> 06:25.557
-Thanks.

06:25.592 --> 06:26.731
-Hi.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.736
-He doesn't say much.

06:31.770 --> 06:32.978
-That's Steve.

06:33.013 --> 06:34.635
He takes a while to warm
up to new people.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.500
-So, who you are, exactly?

06:37.535 --> 06:39.640
-I'm you.

06:39.675 --> 06:40.848
-Thought you looked familiar.

06:42.816 --> 06:44.749
-12 years ago, I was the
kid no one believed.

06:44.783 --> 06:47.821
I, um, I saw something too--

06:47.855 --> 06:48.684
an animal--

06:48.718 --> 06:50.858
a creature, really.

06:50.893 --> 06:53.205
I was walking where I'd walked
a hundred times before.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.138
And for some reason that
day, there it was.

06:55.173 --> 06:58.625
Never seen anything like
it before or since.

06:58.659 --> 06:59.833
-You never saw it again?

06:59.867 --> 07:02.491
-But I knew what I'd seen.

07:02.525 --> 07:04.493
And for a while I tried
to convince other

07:04.527 --> 07:06.115
people I'd seen it too.

07:06.149 --> 07:08.669
I don't need to tell
you how that went.

07:08.704 --> 07:10.775
-My parents practically
measured me for my own

07:10.809 --> 07:12.190
straight jacket.

07:12.224 --> 07:13.087
-Yeah, I know how it feels when
the people you rely on

07:13.122 --> 07:15.227
most don't believe you.

07:15.262 --> 07:19.128
-Have you seen other things,
other creatures?

07:19.162 --> 07:21.510
-There's more out there than
even you and I know about.

07:21.544 --> 07:25.548
I, um, I photograph and
study what I can.

07:25.583 --> 07:28.517
So, Shannon, if you would do
me the honor of being my

07:28.551 --> 07:31.278
guide, tonight I will find
the beast for you.

07:33.936 --> 07:35.109
-I'd be delighted.

07:46.051 --> 07:47.259
-Here, let me help.

07:47.294 --> 07:48.675
-Thanks.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.124
-So you're with Kyle?

07:50.159 --> 07:50.987
-Filming Kyle.

07:51.022 --> 07:52.126
There's a difference.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.338
-Is that the beast freak?

07:57.373 --> 07:59.202
-Oh, we just call her Shannon.

07:59.237 --> 08:00.721
-Good.

08:00.756 --> 08:01.895
It's always better if they
look like they don't live

08:01.929 --> 08:03.586
under a bridge.

08:03.621 --> 08:05.588
-So, I'm Tom.

08:05.623 --> 08:06.278
And you are?

08:06.313 --> 08:08.349
-Busy.

08:08.384 --> 08:10.628
-Jo.

08:10.662 --> 08:13.009
You are Jo.

08:13.044 --> 08:14.770
So what, are you
a film student?

08:14.804 --> 08:16.185
-Yeah.

08:16.219 --> 08:17.324
And I'll let you be in my
documentary if you leave me

08:17.358 --> 08:18.739
alone for two minutes
to settle.

08:18.774 --> 08:21.880
-So you're hunting the
hunter, so to speak.

08:21.915 --> 08:22.812
Right.

08:22.847 --> 08:25.194
I'll just let you get on.

08:25.228 --> 08:27.714
-Excuse me, but if you're going
to interview anyone

08:27.748 --> 08:29.716
about the beast, it
has to be us.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.993
We've known about
it for years.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.380
-What are you looking for?

08:42.693 --> 08:43.073
-I don't know.

08:43.107 --> 08:43.937
I just--

08:43.971 --> 08:44.903
I can't stand still.

08:44.938 --> 08:46.008
-OK.

08:46.042 --> 08:47.388
Water is in bowls.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.632
Wolf snacks are in place.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.633
We're all set.

08:50.668 --> 08:51.876
-OK.

08:51.910 --> 08:52.842
Mads?

08:52.877 --> 08:54.050
-All right.

08:54.085 --> 08:55.224
All the doors and windows
are locked.

08:55.258 --> 08:56.570
No one's getting in
or out tonight.

09:00.816 --> 09:01.920
You two OK?

09:01.955 --> 09:04.578
-Yeah, Mrs. S. Just
a bit twitchy.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.787
-Maddy, if something's going
on, you better tell us now,

09:06.822 --> 09:08.099
because we're running
out of time.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.652
-Why are we doing this?

09:09.687 --> 09:12.068
Didn't we have a great
time last full moon.

09:12.103 --> 09:12.966
Didn't we?

09:13.000 --> 09:13.898
-Well yeah, but--

09:13.932 --> 09:16.417
-We're a proper wolf pack--

09:16.452 --> 09:19.110
free, alive.

09:19.144 --> 09:21.422
I had the best experience
of me life.

09:21.457 --> 09:24.356
And it was because I was sharing
it with you guys.

09:24.391 --> 09:26.151
-It was a special
night, Maddy.

09:26.186 --> 09:27.636
One of the best.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.396
-So why are we pretending
like it never happened?

09:29.430 --> 09:31.156
-Because we're never going
to do it again.

09:31.191 --> 09:32.088
-Why not?

09:32.123 --> 09:33.987
-You know why not, Maddy.

09:34.021 --> 09:35.989
It's not safe for
us out there.

09:36.023 --> 09:36.955
-We were fine.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.888
-No, we were lucky.

09:38.923 --> 09:42.789
What if we'd got shot up by a
farmer, or we'd walked into a

09:42.823 --> 09:44.031
poacher's trap?

09:44.066 --> 09:45.861
-All it takes is one
person to spot us.

09:45.895 --> 09:47.414
And then they'll hunt us down.

09:47.448 --> 09:49.036
It's what they do.

09:49.071 --> 09:50.728
-Tell me that you understand
that, Maddy.

09:53.765 --> 09:54.904
-I do.

09:56.975 --> 09:57.873
-Me too.

09:57.907 --> 09:58.908
-Good.

09:58.943 --> 10:02.360
So that's the end of it.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.258
[music playing]

10:14.717 --> 10:17.375
-A few weeks ago the beast
was circling the village.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.377
Farm animals and pets
were going missing.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.103
I tracked it to this area.

10:21.137 --> 10:23.139
-It's between two farms--

10:23.174 --> 10:23.899
prime hunting ground.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.107
Good job.

10:28.835 --> 10:31.285
-Anything I could do to help?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.217
-Yeah.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.495
See that tree over there?

10:34.530 --> 10:35.911
-Yeah.

10:35.945 --> 10:37.809
-Go stand under it and
leave me alone.

10:37.844 --> 10:39.052
-[scoffing]

10:39.086 --> 10:40.260
-What?

10:40.294 --> 10:41.157
-Just trying to imagine
what you were like

10:41.192 --> 10:43.090
when you were my age.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.713
You must have worn
a lot of black.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.338
-Here.

10:49.372 --> 10:50.511
Don't break anything.

10:53.238 --> 10:56.379
-So, what's the deal
with you and Kyle?

10:56.414 --> 10:58.071
-He needed someone to
put him on camera.

10:58.105 --> 11:00.763
I needed an extraordinary
graduation film to

11:00.798 --> 11:02.454
kick start my career.

11:02.489 --> 11:03.697
So we found each other.

11:03.732 --> 11:05.492
-So, you two are--

11:05.526 --> 11:06.804
-For a bit.

11:06.838 --> 11:08.150
Then Kyle.

11:08.184 --> 11:11.429
Well, I mean, we decided
the rate was--

11:11.463 --> 11:12.706
great.

11:12.741 --> 11:14.018
Let's just share life
stories while my

11:14.052 --> 11:14.984
camera battery drains.

11:15.019 --> 11:16.399
Kyle, your public's waiting.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.550
So, Kyle, tell us
what's going on.

11:29.585 --> 11:32.277
-This is Shannon Kelly.

11:32.312 --> 11:33.485
-Hi.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.039
-Shannon is on the trail
of a creature known

11:35.073 --> 11:36.523
locally as the beast.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.076
Uh, she's brought us here to the
exact spot where we stand

11:38.111 --> 11:40.113
the best chance of seeing
it tonight.

11:40.147 --> 11:41.977
The full moon is about to rise,
and the creatures of the

11:42.011 --> 11:43.288
night are coming out to play.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.324
-And cut.

11:44.358 --> 11:45.049
Nice.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.119
Very poetic.

11:46.153 --> 11:47.258
-And don't let me
get too fancy.

11:47.292 --> 11:48.466
I don't want to lose
the audience.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.951
-So, how do you want
to do this?

11:50.986 --> 11:52.159
-Steve.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.131
-What is that?

11:58.165 --> 12:01.755
-A secure container, harmless
but inescapable.

12:01.790 --> 12:04.585
We're going to catch
the beast.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.208
-Our first time as a family.

12:06.242 --> 12:08.141
I feel like I should
make a speech.

12:08.175 --> 12:09.383
-Well, you better make it quick
if you don't want to end

12:09.418 --> 12:11.006
it growling.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.800
-Come on.

12:11.834 --> 12:12.973
The moon won't wait.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.185
-Maddy?

12:18.220 --> 12:19.324
-I'm sorry.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.843
-Maddy!

12:20.878 --> 12:22.155
-Open this door!

12:22.189 --> 12:24.053
-Don't you dare!

12:24.088 --> 12:25.883
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy,
open this door now!

12:25.917 --> 12:27.160
-I'll see you in the morning.

12:27.194 --> 12:28.782
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy,
I mean it!

12:28.817 --> 12:29.541
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: You are
in so much trouble, Maddy.

12:29.576 --> 12:30.784
-You sure about this?

12:30.819 --> 12:31.233
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]:
Open this door.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.372
-No.

12:32.406 --> 12:34.063
Let's hurry, before
I lose my nerve.

12:34.098 --> 12:35.271
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy!

12:35.306 --> 12:36.169
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: I
can't believe you

12:36.203 --> 12:37.411
are doing this, Maddy.

12:37.446 --> 12:38.827
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy!

12:38.861 --> 12:40.207
-I didn't bring you here
so you can catch it.

12:40.242 --> 12:41.312
-Shannon, relax.

12:41.346 --> 12:42.831
This is for our safety.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.971
You said yourself the beast
is killing animals.

12:45.005 --> 12:47.318
It could easily turn on us
if it isn't contained.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.044
-So what, then you're
going to let it go?

12:49.078 --> 12:51.632
-I'm not in the business of
caging wild animals, no matter

12:51.667 --> 12:52.944
how unusual.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.152
We put it in here to
get a closer look.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.015
That's all.

12:55.050 --> 12:56.361
-That's cool with me.

12:56.396 --> 12:59.606
Look, that thing has some
serious fangs, Shannon.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.297
-OK.

13:01.332 --> 13:01.988
I'm sorry.

13:02.022 --> 13:03.058
It's just--

13:03.092 --> 13:04.645
it just got real,
all of a sudden.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.509
-And that's why I'm
here, Shannon--

13:06.544 --> 13:09.512
to show the world the
beast is real, OK?

13:09.547 --> 13:10.824
-OK.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.241
-They're gonna kill it.

13:14.276 --> 13:15.242
-What are you going
to say them?

13:15.277 --> 13:16.519
-I don't know.

13:16.554 --> 13:17.313
But I don't think sorry
is going to cut it.

13:17.348 --> 13:18.245
-We could go back.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.042
-Do you want to?

13:25.011 --> 13:25.597
-Look.

13:25.632 --> 13:26.529
Put it on me.

13:26.564 --> 13:27.841
Tell them I made you do it.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.119
-Thanks, but I'll
take the blame.

13:30.154 --> 13:31.327
I've earned it.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.642
-It's starting.

13:35.676 --> 13:36.988
Come on.

13:38.956 --> 13:40.889
-This is all very dramatic,
but what makes you so sure

13:40.923 --> 13:41.993
you'll find the beast tonight?

13:42.028 --> 13:43.029
-Stay tuned.

13:43.063 --> 13:44.168
Jo, on me.

13:46.687 --> 13:48.517
You know what's great
about science?

13:48.551 --> 13:50.588
Eventually, it can achieve
pretty much anything.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.590
Just put it the hours in the
lab, and you can make all

13:52.624 --> 13:54.385
sorts of cool things happen.

13:54.419 --> 13:57.215
This is bait, a scent engineered
at a cellular level

13:57.250 --> 13:59.666
to attract the predatory
olfactory system, which is

13:59.700 --> 14:03.221
smart speak for it rocks.

14:03.256 --> 14:08.986
And this is your basic Sunday
roast, before all the cooking

14:09.020 --> 14:11.298
and the gravy.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.472
We add the scent.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.546
It'll spread.

14:17.580 --> 14:20.169
And if there's a supernatural
carnivore out there, it's

14:20.204 --> 14:21.377
going to come running.

14:25.036 --> 14:26.589
-Switching to night vision.

14:26.624 --> 14:27.659
-OK.

14:27.694 --> 14:28.557
Let's fall back to
the truck first.

14:28.591 --> 14:29.696
Steve?

14:38.463 --> 14:44.090
[rustling]

14:44.124 --> 14:48.335
[sniffing]

14:48.370 --> 14:49.509
-Do you smell that?

14:49.543 --> 14:52.926
[sniffing]

15:04.317 --> 15:05.628
[growling]

15:11.427 --> 15:12.359
-So--

15:12.394 --> 15:14.051
-No.

15:14.085 --> 15:15.535
-Sorry?

15:15.569 --> 15:17.399
-You were either going to ask me
if you could help or try to

15:17.433 --> 15:19.021
find out something personal
about me.

15:19.056 --> 15:20.989
Either way, the answer is no.

15:21.023 --> 15:22.128
-It's cold out.

15:22.162 --> 15:23.439
-I'm pretty warm actually.

15:23.474 --> 15:24.647
-Wasn't talking about
the weather.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.071
-Psst.

15:34.105 --> 15:36.521
I see movement, 10 o'clock.

15:40.491 --> 15:41.423
-What are you doing?

15:41.457 --> 15:43.321
-It's a tranquilizer gun--

15:43.356 --> 15:44.805
be perfectly harmless.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.117
Vets use them all the time.

15:46.152 --> 15:47.222
-Well, will it hurt it?

15:47.256 --> 15:48.326
-No.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.673
It'll put it out for
a few minutes.

15:50.708 --> 15:53.504
Everyone stay quiet.

15:53.538 --> 15:56.507
Jo, don't miss this.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.749
-I never miss.

15:57.784 --> 15:58.336
[gunshot]

15:58.371 --> 15:59.165
-[gasp]

15:59.199 --> 16:01.339
[thumping]

16:01.374 --> 16:02.271
-Did you miss?

16:02.306 --> 16:03.203
-No.

16:03.238 --> 16:05.033
There's two of them.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.758
-Two beasts?

16:06.793 --> 16:07.690
[gunshot]

16:07.725 --> 16:09.002
[thumping]

16:12.523 --> 16:14.042
-Oh, oh wait.

16:14.076 --> 16:15.319
They might not be
fully under yet.

16:15.353 --> 16:16.630
-I have to see them.

16:16.665 --> 16:18.046
-Let me and Steve get them
into the container.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.049
Safety first, OK?

16:21.083 --> 16:22.257
-OK.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.154
-Jo?

16:23.189 --> 16:24.293
-What about safety first?

16:24.328 --> 16:26.468
-Fine, miss the reveal.

16:26.502 --> 16:28.090
-Steve, go ahead and
check that out.

16:28.125 --> 16:31.369
-Maddy and Rhydian are going to
be so mad they missed this.

16:31.404 --> 16:32.370
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: Do
the one first.

16:32.405 --> 16:33.302
-You OK?

16:33.337 --> 16:34.683
-Yeah, why?

16:34.717 --> 16:35.856
-You're shaking.

16:35.891 --> 16:36.685
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: You
grab the head.

16:36.719 --> 16:37.272
I'll grab the feet.

16:37.306 --> 16:37.824
Yeah?

16:37.858 --> 16:38.652
Steve, slowly.

16:38.687 --> 16:39.757
-Is this happening?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.069
Like is this actually
happening?

16:41.103 --> 16:41.724
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: What
are you doing?

16:41.759 --> 16:42.656
-Yeah, believe it.

16:42.691 --> 16:44.279
-I don't think I can.

16:44.313 --> 16:45.142
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: All right,
let's get the smaller one.

16:45.176 --> 16:45.763
-What if I wake up?

16:45.797 --> 16:46.660
-Shannon.

16:46.695 --> 16:47.316
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: Gently.

16:47.351 --> 16:48.041
That's it.

16:48.076 --> 16:48.800
-Believe it.

16:48.835 --> 16:49.387
KYLE [OFFSCREEN]: OK.

16:49.422 --> 16:50.526
Come on.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.404
-Are they--

17:06.439 --> 17:07.578
they're wolves.

17:09.718 --> 17:12.203
Tom, they're wolves.

17:12.238 --> 17:15.448
All this time, it was wolves.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.450
My beast isn't a beast at all?

17:17.483 --> 17:18.692
-How can there be wolves here?

17:18.727 --> 17:20.142
They've been extinct in
Britain for years.

17:20.176 --> 17:22.454
-Well, maybe people just
think they died out.

17:22.489 --> 17:25.319
Maybe they've been here all the
time, surviving without

17:25.354 --> 17:26.079
anyone knowing.

17:26.114 --> 17:26.665
-All right.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.219
You ready, Kyle?

17:28.253 --> 17:29.600
Sleeping animals are a lot
easier to film than angry,

17:29.634 --> 17:32.258
snarly ones.

17:32.292 --> 17:35.123
-Turns out the beast wasn't
a beast at all.

17:35.157 --> 17:37.332
Thought to be extinct in
this country, these

17:37.366 --> 17:39.092
two wolves have survived.

17:39.127 --> 17:43.924
Their existence is secret for
years, until I found them.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.409
Not a bad night's work, ay?

17:49.551 --> 17:50.724
-They're waking up.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.416
You should let them go now.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.211
-And why would I do that?

17:54.245 --> 17:54.935
[knocks]

17:54.970 --> 17:56.696
Give us a hand, Steve.

17:56.730 --> 17:58.525
-What are you doing?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.355
-Well, I'm not going to leave
them here for someone else to

18:00.389 --> 18:01.321
find, am I?

18:01.356 --> 18:02.460
-So you're keeping them?

18:02.495 --> 18:03.772
As what, as some
sort of trophy?

18:03.806 --> 18:05.153
-For now.

18:05.187 --> 18:06.430
And then I'll uh--

18:06.464 --> 18:08.846
I'll sell them off to the
zoo or something.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.365
-Why?

18:10.399 --> 18:11.193
There are thousands of other
wolves in the world?

18:11.228 --> 18:12.712
-But not like these.

18:12.746 --> 18:15.473
Plucky English survivors where
wolves have been extinct for

18:15.508 --> 18:16.785
hundreds of years.

18:16.819 --> 18:19.546
I could sell the movie rights.

18:19.581 --> 18:20.858
I might even play myself.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.654
Oh, Jo, we'll do close-ups
back at my place?

18:23.688 --> 18:24.379
-Did you not hear?

18:24.413 --> 18:25.897
They're wolves.

18:25.932 --> 18:27.623
Not space wolves or thunder
wolves, just regular wolves.

18:27.658 --> 18:28.762
-And this is their home.

18:28.797 --> 18:30.868
-Oh, so go and write
a song about it.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.387
Thanks for your help.

18:32.421 --> 18:34.285
I couldn't have done it without
you, et cetera.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.460
And it's over, and it's
way past your bedtime.

18:36.494 --> 18:38.186
-What is wrong with you?

18:38.220 --> 18:39.428
You're obsessed.

18:39.463 --> 18:40.947
-Yeah, and that means a
lot coming from her.

18:40.981 --> 18:47.160
-Shannon and Shannon's friend,
say goodbye to the puppies,

18:47.195 --> 18:49.852
because they're going to
their new home now.

18:49.887 --> 18:51.233
Steve, check the map.

18:51.268 --> 18:52.269
We need to figure a way
out of this place,

18:52.303 --> 18:53.580
away from these kids.

18:53.615 --> 18:55.927
And then go back and
secure the crate.

18:55.962 --> 19:01.588
[panting]

19:06.662 --> 19:08.250
-Did you know about this?

19:08.285 --> 19:10.735
-What, that Kyle's an egomaniac
who will trample

19:10.770 --> 19:12.220
over anyone to get
what he wants?

19:12.254 --> 19:14.567
I had an inkling, yes, but
he's just proved it.

19:14.601 --> 19:15.706
-So you let him use us?

19:15.740 --> 19:17.397
-No.

19:17.432 --> 19:19.399
Listen, all I wanted was
to get the best film

19:19.434 --> 19:20.918
possible out of this.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.954
So we might not like how Kyle
operates, but the audience

19:22.989 --> 19:24.335
loves controversy.

19:24.370 --> 19:25.888
If you don't have an audience,
you're nothing.

19:25.923 --> 19:27.925
-So the more immoral he is,
the more you like him.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.720
-Welcome to show biz.

19:29.754 --> 19:32.378
-Looks like you found your
soul mate after all.

19:32.412 --> 19:34.897
-Hey, hey, hey.

19:34.932 --> 19:35.864
If that you're that desperate
to save something,

19:35.898 --> 19:37.555
go sponsor a panda.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.557
Steve, we're leaving.

19:44.735 --> 19:45.563
-Filmmakers observe.

19:45.598 --> 19:46.840
They don't interfere.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.325
It's just how it is.

19:48.359 --> 19:49.740
-[ANGRILY] How's pathetic?

19:49.774 --> 19:51.500
You're turning a blind eye to
something you know isn't

19:51.535 --> 19:52.674
right.

19:52.708 --> 19:53.985
-Hey, he's the bad
guy here, not me.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.539
There's nothing I can
do to stop him.

19:55.573 --> 19:56.954
-Or maybe you're scared if you
do stop him, you'll get

19:56.988 --> 19:58.542
a film out of it.

19:58.576 --> 20:00.854
-Doesn't it occur to you that he
might be using you the way

20:00.889 --> 20:02.373
he used us?

20:02.408 --> 20:03.340
-So?

20:03.374 --> 20:04.272
I'm using him back.

20:04.306 --> 20:04.962
We're even.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.792
-But it isn't right.

20:07.827 --> 20:08.966
OK.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.692
How about this?

20:10.726 --> 20:12.728
Doesn't an audience love
an unexpected twist?

20:19.287 --> 20:21.047
-You're sure this is
an actual road?

20:21.081 --> 20:22.566
-Yeah, not to many people
know about it.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.050
But it's a good shortcut.

20:24.084 --> 20:25.914
-As long as you avoid
the bulk.

20:25.948 --> 20:31.368
-So, got any words for
your audience?

20:31.402 --> 20:32.438
-Point the camera at Shannon.

20:32.472 --> 20:34.440
-OK.

20:34.474 --> 20:35.924
-So, Shannon, tell us
why we're in the

20:35.958 --> 20:38.513
middle of a chase scene?

20:38.547 --> 20:41.654
-Because Kyle Weathers is a
glory hunter who only wants

20:41.688 --> 20:44.829
fame, and he doesn't care what
he destroys to get it.

20:44.864 --> 20:48.039
He has taken two beautiful
wolves out their natural

20:48.074 --> 20:51.940
habitat to make himself look
good and make money.

20:51.974 --> 20:54.322
And I'm not going to
let that happen.

20:54.356 --> 20:55.909
-[clears throat]

20:55.944 --> 20:57.842
-We're not going to
let that happen.

20:57.877 --> 20:58.843
Sorry.

20:58.878 --> 21:00.362
You can edit that out, right?

21:00.397 --> 21:01.536
And this bit too?

21:06.472 --> 21:07.369
-[sigh]

21:07.404 --> 21:08.577
Pesky kids.

21:13.824 --> 21:15.791
-I'm not moving until you
let the wolves go.

21:15.826 --> 21:17.379
-I mean it.

21:17.414 --> 21:18.380
Didn't mommy and daddy teach you
that we can't always get

21:18.415 --> 21:19.588
what we want?

21:19.623 --> 21:21.003
-They taught me to stand
up for what's right.

21:21.038 --> 21:23.799
-Then they did a much better
job than my parents.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.491
-Go home and make them a
cupper to say thanks.

21:25.525 --> 21:27.009
-You said you were
just like me.

21:29.874 --> 21:31.600
-Oh, sweetie.

21:31.635 --> 21:33.809
No one's that weird.

21:33.844 --> 21:35.328
-So everything you
said was a lie?

21:35.363 --> 21:37.330
-Finally, you get it.

21:37.365 --> 21:39.436
Now will you move?

21:39.470 --> 21:42.093
-I should have known you were
too good to be true.

21:42.128 --> 21:45.476
And because I trusted you,
everything mysterious and

21:45.511 --> 21:46.995
magical is over.

21:47.029 --> 21:48.859
-Yeah, cheese factor 50.

21:48.893 --> 21:51.827
Are all teenage girls like this,
or just the crazy ones?

21:51.862 --> 21:53.933
-I'm glad I'm not like you.

21:53.967 --> 21:56.487
-Shannon, if your plan was to
appeal to my better nature,

21:56.522 --> 21:58.834
it's not going to work.

21:58.869 --> 22:01.492
I don't have one.

22:01.527 --> 22:06.152
-Yeah, well that was plan A.
Plan B was to keep you talking

22:06.186 --> 22:08.706
long enough for Tom to sneak
around the back of you truck

22:08.741 --> 22:11.088
and let the wolves go.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.400
-What?

22:14.712 --> 22:16.680
-Award-winning footage, Kyle.

22:16.714 --> 22:18.475
Think you might be thinning
a bit in the back though.

22:28.174 --> 22:30.072
-Steve?

22:30.107 --> 22:31.211
Steve!

22:34.249 --> 22:36.665
Steve!

22:36.700 --> 22:37.770
-Oh yeah, about the film?

22:37.804 --> 22:41.636
I've decided to go
another way.

22:41.670 --> 22:42.982
-OK.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.501
Yeah.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.399
Two points to the
kindergarten.

22:46.434 --> 22:47.849
You've slowed me down,
that's all.

22:47.883 --> 22:50.541
I've got the bat and I'll
be back for your wolves.

22:57.859 --> 23:00.448
-He is right about the bait.

23:00.482 --> 23:01.483
-Yeah.

23:01.518 --> 23:03.692
I mean, wolves can't
resist it.

23:03.727 --> 23:10.112
Although since I've got it, it's
probably no use to him.

23:10.147 --> 23:11.528
-[laughs]

23:11.562 --> 23:12.701
-Very stealthy.

23:15.773 --> 23:16.878
-Thank you very much.

23:16.912 --> 23:19.536
Think I'm ready for
my close-up now?

23:19.570 --> 23:21.538
This is for all the
wolves out there.

23:21.572 --> 23:22.815
Howl it with me now.

23:22.849 --> 23:28.027
[howls]

23:28.061 --> 23:29.753
-I remember the scent.

23:29.787 --> 23:31.237
And then it went dark.

23:31.271 --> 23:32.480
And then I saw that man.

23:32.514 --> 23:33.964
-Yeah, he smelled bad.

23:33.998 --> 23:34.792
-Then Shannon.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.069
-Yeah, but then Tom.

23:36.104 --> 23:37.105
-Which means that we must
have been trapped.

23:37.139 --> 23:38.520
-Then released.

23:38.555 --> 23:40.246
-By Tom.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.904
We probably owe Shannon
and Tom our lives.

23:42.938 --> 23:45.700
How are we going
to thank them?

23:45.734 --> 23:47.149
-What are you going to
tell your parents?

23:47.184 --> 23:48.288
-The truth.

23:48.323 --> 23:49.635
-Why?

23:49.669 --> 23:50.498
-Because he could come
back, and they've

23:50.532 --> 23:51.982
got a right to know.

23:52.016 --> 23:52.845
-OK.

23:52.879 --> 23:54.018
I'm coming with you.

23:54.053 --> 23:54.605
-No.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.468
-What?

23:55.503 --> 23:55.882
Let me take the blame?

23:55.917 --> 23:56.849
-No.

23:56.883 --> 23:58.851
I got us into this, not you.

23:58.885 --> 24:01.888
Although I'm in so much trouble,
I think they might

24:01.923 --> 24:03.856
actually eat us.

24:03.890 --> 24:06.721
I'll see you the next time I'm
allowed out, which is probably

24:06.755 --> 24:08.826
in the next 50 years or so.

24:08.861 --> 24:10.656
-You could always leave them in
the den until they promise

24:10.690 --> 24:11.657
not to punish you.

24:11.691 --> 24:12.520
-Yeah.

24:12.554 --> 24:13.797
I might just do that.

24:13.831 --> 24:15.212
-You sure you don't want
to split the blame?

24:15.246 --> 24:16.869
-Positive.

24:16.903 --> 24:17.904
-OK.

24:17.939 --> 24:18.767
Well, I'll see you
in 50 years.

24:28.984 --> 24:30.503
I

24:30.538 --> 24:31.884
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: I can smell
you out there, young lady.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.196
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: You
are beyond grounded.

24:34.231 --> 24:35.957
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: Open
this door, Maddy.

24:35.991 --> 24:37.096
Open the door!

24:43.067 --> 24:44.241
[theme music]
