â™ª Good morning, USA! â™ª

00:33.908 --> 00:36.368
I wanted you guys
to be the first to know...

00:36.493 --> 00:37.769
I'm getting married!

00:37.894 --> 00:39.081
Hey!

00:40.731 --> 00:44.126
Stan, you were the one who
introduced me to Olivia,

00:44.251 --> 00:48.013
which... is why I wanted to ask you

00:48.138 --> 00:51.967
if you would do me the
honor of being my best...

00:52.092 --> 00:53.685
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

00:53.810 --> 00:55.220
Jeremy?!
Michael!

00:55.345 --> 00:56.738
My twin brother!

00:56.863 --> 00:58.307
I can't believe you've come back

00:58.432 --> 01:00.576
after being lost at sea for 12 years!

01:00.701 --> 01:02.210
Will you be my best man?!

01:02.335 --> 01:03.814
Yes.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.548
I hope you two

01:06.673 --> 01:07.916
will be very happy!

01:16.750 --> 01:19.645
Michael was my last single
guy friend, Francine.

01:19.770 --> 01:22.249
He was my last chance
to be a best man!

01:22.415 --> 01:25.836
Being a best man is something
I've dreamt of my entire life.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.310
â™ª â™ª

01:33.926 --> 01:36.078
My dream is over, Francine.

01:36.203 --> 01:37.863
They say you have a better chance

01:37.988 --> 01:39.531
of getting hit by a meteor

01:39.656 --> 01:41.767
than of being a best
man after you're 40.

01:41.892 --> 01:42.951
Who says that?

01:43.076 --> 01:44.286
Roger.

01:44.411 --> 01:45.887
So we know it's true, then.

01:46.012 --> 01:47.422
Come on, think.

01:47.547 --> 01:49.708
You must have one single guy friend.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.362
Well, there is one.

01:52.528 --> 01:55.564
Who wants to see me pee on this cake?

01:59.226 --> 02:01.037
Principal Brian Lewis.

02:01.203 --> 02:03.498
My last single guy friend.

02:07.851 --> 02:09.945
Yeah, Superintendent!

02:10.070 --> 02:11.897
Blast my Buddah belly!

02:14.425 --> 02:16.218
Oh, I'll never be a best man.

02:16.343 --> 02:17.953
Don't give up on your dream, Stan.

02:19.412 --> 02:21.089
All you need to do
is convince Lewis...

02:21.214 --> 02:22.591
Lewis! Ooh!

02:22.716 --> 02:25.360
...to get married and then
convince some girl to marry him.

02:25.485 --> 02:26.628
You're right!

02:26.753 --> 02:27.796
How hard can it be?

02:27.921 --> 02:29.164
Sweets, you killed my master.

02:29.289 --> 02:30.399
Now you die!

02:30.524 --> 02:31.867
Cake! Cake!
Pie! Brownie!

02:31.992 --> 02:34.042
Cookie, cookie, cookie, cookie!

02:35.988 --> 02:39.910
No. No. No. No.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.410
No. No. No. No...

02:41.535 --> 02:43.311
That's the dude
I was telling you about

02:43.436 --> 02:45.147
while we were playing army guys.

02:45.272 --> 02:47.182
Oh, the weird shorts guy?

02:47.307 --> 02:49.284
He comes in every weekend...

02:49.409 --> 02:51.421
...tries on all the shorts,
and never buys anything.

02:51.645 --> 02:54.022
Where's a mirror?

02:54.147 --> 02:57.109
Maybe there's one
through this odd, tiny door.

02:59.936 --> 03:02.814
I have been waiting for you.

03:02.939 --> 03:05.117
And I, you.

03:05.242 --> 03:07.187
What's happening? What
are we talking about?

03:07.353 --> 03:09.512
I made you shorts.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.924
I don't know.

03:13.049 --> 03:15.794
Like Lil' Kim, I have
a real tough body for shorts.

03:15.919 --> 03:17.229
How much are they?

03:17.354 --> 03:20.498
Like everything at Ross,
it is impossible to tell,

03:20.623 --> 03:23.036
because the price tag has fallen off.

03:25.913 --> 03:27.880
I'll try them on, but I don't...

03:29.750 --> 03:31.610
My God.

03:31.735 --> 03:33.228
They're amazing.

03:34.888 --> 03:37.399
I wish Mom could figure out Skype

03:37.524 --> 03:39.469
so I could show her these shorts.

03:42.179 --> 03:43.371
I want to apologize again

03:43.496 --> 03:45.475
for my behavior at the
school the other night.

03:45.715 --> 03:47.576
I take allergy medicine,
and I'm not supposed

03:47.701 --> 03:50.063
to drink 14 shots of tequila
when I'm on it.

03:50.229 --> 03:52.414
You know, you should think
about settling down.

03:52.539 --> 03:55.735
Find a nice woman, get married,
share your life with someone.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.586
When you say, "share my life,"

03:57.711 --> 04:00.198
I hear, "share my tequila,"
and I think, "no."

04:01.281 --> 04:02.991
Here, try a hot wing.

04:03.116 --> 04:04.776
They're 100% boneless.

04:04.901 --> 04:06.705
No bones. Zero.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.063
Boneless!

04:08.188 --> 04:10.849
They got some food scientists
up in here, huh?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.319
Bone-full!

04:14.444 --> 04:16.488
They are full...
of bones!

04:25.255 --> 04:27.566
You almost died, bro! Alone!

04:27.691 --> 04:29.301
Oh, God!
Alone, bro!

04:29.426 --> 04:31.036
I don't want to die alone, bro!

04:31.161 --> 04:32.304
No one does, bro!

04:32.429 --> 04:34.172
You need to settle
down and get married.

04:34.297 --> 04:35.373
You're scaring me, bro!

04:35.498 --> 04:36.526
Get married, bro!

04:36.692 --> 04:37.876
Okay, damn it.
All right!

04:38.001 --> 04:39.094
Yes! Don't worry.

04:39.219 --> 04:41.448
I'll help you get your life
on the right path.

04:41.671 --> 04:43.533
Now we just have
to find someone to marry you.

04:43.773 --> 04:46.351
Well, I was seeing a real
classy broad recently.

04:46.476 --> 04:48.553
- Totally different from all the women...
- Hookers.

04:48.678 --> 04:51.189
...hookers-- thank you--
that I've dated in the past.

04:51.314 --> 04:53.058
But she dumped me
because I wouldn't commit.

04:53.183 --> 04:54.377
Perfect! Who is she?

04:56.504 --> 04:57.829
Yes, I broke up with Brian

04:57.954 --> 04:59.883
because I wasn't his first priority.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.428
It was cocaine,
which he pronounced "kyo-kayne."

05:03.594 --> 05:06.421
Superintendent, his brush
with death has changed him.

05:06.546 --> 05:08.391
He wants to get married now.

05:08.615 --> 05:11.102
I will marry him if he's serious.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.480
He is serious.
He is <i>dead</i> serious.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.597
No drugs, no drinking,
and a home-cooked meal

05:15.722 --> 05:17.359
with my parents two nights a week.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.967
Agreed on the drugs and drinking

05:19.092 --> 05:21.186
and parents dinner
once a week at a restaurant.

05:22.662 --> 05:25.033
And he'd like you
to give him a lefty cappuccino.

05:25.199 --> 05:25.951
What's that?

05:27.851 --> 05:29.544
It's not something you'd agree to

05:29.669 --> 05:31.206
if you knew what it was.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.082
Agreed.

05:35.175 --> 05:38.236
Now, do you have something
to ask me, Brian?

05:38.361 --> 05:39.905
Me, your man friend

05:40.030 --> 05:41.706
who has led you down this blissful

05:41.831 --> 05:43.635
and <i>best</i> life path?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.310
Oh, okay.

05:45.435 --> 05:47.347
Do you want to be my...?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.724
You want to maybe do this right,
or are you going to half-ass it?

05:49.890 --> 05:52.067
Get down on one knee.

05:54.044 --> 05:55.271
â™ª â™ª

05:55.437 --> 05:57.939
Okay, now. Do it now.

05:58.064 --> 05:59.841
Everything is perfect.

05:59.966 --> 06:02.460
Stan, will you be my best man?

06:02.585 --> 06:04.846
Oh, yes! Yes, I will!

06:04.971 --> 06:08.300
Up until now,
I've just been a great man.

06:08.425 --> 06:11.553
Now, I will be a best man.

06:11.678 --> 06:13.540
And I'm the Crest Man.

06:14.931 --> 06:17.002
I'm living in my car.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.268
â™ª â™ª

06:24.341 --> 06:25.718
And obviously,

06:25.843 --> 06:28.554
the last dance of the night
will be The Humpty Dance.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.556
I'm so proud of him, Stan.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.558
He's two weeks sober,
jogging every day,

06:32.683 --> 06:34.560
sleeping 14 hours a night.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.462
Can't get in trouble if I'm asleep!

06:36.587 --> 06:38.197
He's pronouncing "cocaine" properly,

06:38.322 --> 06:39.698
hasn't peed on any cakes,

06:39.823 --> 06:42.725
and hasn't challenged a dog
to a fistfight in days.

06:52.703 --> 06:56.332
Sorry to rush off, but I've got
a City Council meeting.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.935
I'm gonna listen to the CD
you made me in the car.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.637
I love track eight.

07:01.762 --> 07:03.272
Oh, if you like track eight,

07:03.397 --> 07:05.508
then you're gonna <i>love</i> track seven.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.243
I've already heard track seven.

07:07.368 --> 07:09.168
Oh, you're gonna love it!

07:12.006 --> 07:13.783
Okay, did you bring the old photos

07:13.908 --> 07:15.885
for the bachelor party slideshow?

07:16.010 --> 07:17.877
Right here!

07:20.606 --> 07:23.109
This looks like a publicity
photo for <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

07:23.275 --> 07:25.077
It's actually a picture of my family,

07:25.202 --> 07:27.614
but my life <i>was</i>
the inspiration for that show.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.265
You're kidding.
Nope.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.167
My older brother William, aka Willis,

07:31.292 --> 07:33.402
and I were adopted
by a rich white guy.

07:33.527 --> 07:35.337
All that stuff really happened to me.

07:35.462 --> 07:37.506
I smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the closet,

07:37.631 --> 07:40.919
a fat man tried to touch me and
my friend in a bicycle shop...

07:41.085 --> 07:42.411
You just left Dudley there!

07:42.536 --> 07:43.646
I did.

07:43.771 --> 07:46.424
He's real messed up now.

07:46.590 --> 07:48.784
That's me and Tracy Bryant,

07:48.909 --> 07:50.887
my prison cellmate for three years.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.822
We lost touch when I got out.

07:52.947 --> 07:56.025
I don't even know if he's still
in the joint or what.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.812
Man, we go way back, like car seats.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.863
<i>Yo, Tracy,
you gonna lift weights?</i>

08:00.988 --> 08:03.899
<i>Yeah, Brian. Nothing else
to do in here but get strong.</i>

08:04.024 --> 08:05.601
<i>What you lookin' at, bitch?</i>

08:05.726 --> 08:07.036
<i>Bitch,
I'm lookin' at</i> you, <i>bitch!</i>

08:07.161 --> 08:08.537
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

08:11.932 --> 08:13.809
<i>Well,
Lewis is obviously deep in thought.</i>

08:13.934 --> 08:14.977
<i>Guess I'll take this opportunity</i>

08:15.102 --> 08:16.512
<i>to do my own thinking.</i>

08:16.637 --> 08:18.447
<i>Hey, I should find
his old cellmate, Tracy,</i>

08:18.572 --> 08:20.216
<i>and invite him to the wedding.</i>

08:20.341 --> 08:22.085
<i>What a great best man thing to do!</i>

08:24.979 --> 08:28.181
Stan, you and me is thinking buddies.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.760
Roger, I've seen you in shorts.

08:31.885 --> 08:33.261
You look terrible in them.

08:33.386 --> 08:36.097
Remember, I told you
not to wear short...

08:36.222 --> 08:39.568
I see my beauty has caused
you to be quiet mid-sentence.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.135
Oh, my God.

08:41.260 --> 08:43.054
How is that even possible?!

08:43.179 --> 08:44.897
I don't know!
I mean, watch.

08:47.468 --> 08:49.945
But much like the
appeal of the Ugg boot,

08:50.070 --> 08:51.914
I'm not questioning
it, just accepting it.

08:52.039 --> 08:54.149
Now I need to think
of a perfect venue

08:54.274 --> 08:56.142
to debut my new shorts.

08:57.678 --> 09:00.055
What if you wear them up in the club?

09:00.180 --> 09:01.991
In... Miami?

09:08.297 --> 09:10.349
Welcome to Miami.
Enjoy your stay.

09:10.474 --> 09:14.277
And now phase three: to enroll
at Florida State University!

09:15.888 --> 09:19.191
How did a baby and a dog
get on a flight to Miami?

09:19.316 --> 09:21.510
Guess they're not as interested
in reality as we are.

09:21.635 --> 09:22.845
Yup, we're keepin' it real.

09:22.970 --> 09:25.064
Just a boy and an alien on a bus.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.634
A boy and an alien in a wig
and magical shorts on a bus.

09:28.759 --> 09:30.426
â™ª Super real! â™ª

09:35.232 --> 09:37.035
Attention, everyone!

09:37.201 --> 09:38.377
As the best man,

09:38.502 --> 09:40.538
I've got a special surprise
for the groom.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.684
It took some doing, but
I finally managed to find him...

09:45.809 --> 09:48.630
Tracy Bryant, your old cellmate!

09:48.796 --> 09:49.505
Tracy?!

09:49.671 --> 09:50.980
Been a long time, Brian.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.493
I can't believe
you're getting married,

09:54.618 --> 09:56.763
'cause you already married...
to me!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.764
I'm his prison wife!

09:58.889 --> 10:01.166
This ring is made out of love
and commitment

10:01.291 --> 10:03.102
and pipe cleaners and human teeth!

10:03.268 --> 10:04.312
You're married?!

10:04.478 --> 10:06.522
Mm-hmm, to this bitch!

10:06.688 --> 10:07.899
Ellen, I can explain...

10:08.065 --> 10:09.541
Yeah, explain how
you're gonna stand here

10:09.666 --> 10:11.210
in front of all these nice people

10:11.335 --> 10:12.711
and commit a sin like this.

10:12.836 --> 10:14.196
I (bleep) your ass!

10:14.321 --> 10:16.198
But how is this even possible?!

10:16.323 --> 10:18.124
Allow me to break it down for you.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.990
<i>According to prison rules,
I became Lewis' bitch</i>

10:25.115 --> 10:26.876
<i>after he beat up my previous husband.</i>

10:27.042 --> 10:29.495
<i>After that, we had three years
of wedded bliss.</i>

10:29.620 --> 10:31.547
<i>We shared a home...</i>

10:31.713 --> 10:33.424
<i>a job...</i>

10:33.707 --> 10:36.678
<i>...and some excellent toilet wine.</i>

10:36.844 --> 10:38.187
But that was years ago!

10:38.312 --> 10:39.521
Prison rules are serious.

10:39.646 --> 10:41.123
We follow them till we die!

10:41.248 --> 10:43.559
It took me 15 years
to find you, Big Lew,

10:43.684 --> 10:44.927
and I'm never leaving you again.

10:45.052 --> 10:46.437
Ever! Forever!

10:46.603 --> 10:47.680
Get out of here, Tracy!

10:47.805 --> 10:49.148
I don't need this now.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.816
I've finally got my life on track.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.277
I say "cocaine" now.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.069
This is all your fault.

10:54.194 --> 10:55.771
Don't let him ruin my wedding.

10:55.896 --> 10:57.840
Hey, it's <i>our</i> wedding.

10:57.965 --> 10:59.409
Don't worry.
I'll-I'll fix this.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.076
Brian, you've gotten fat on me.

11:01.201 --> 11:02.578
More for me to zerbert!

11:04.037 --> 11:06.332
Got to blow up my brown beach ball!

11:06.498 --> 11:10.193
â™ª â™ª

11:13.338 --> 11:14.506
This must be

11:14.631 --> 11:17.927
what Thomas Haden Church
feels like all the time.

11:18.093 --> 11:19.819
â™ª â™ª

11:35.602 --> 11:38.054
I am loving these shorts!

11:42.259 --> 11:44.620
You are beautiful!

11:44.745 --> 11:46.104
I know!

11:46.229 --> 11:48.807
I am legendary homosexual
Ricky Martin!

11:48.932 --> 11:50.766
That I did not know!

11:52.461 --> 11:53.545
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.997
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey...

11:55.122 --> 11:56.248
These Cubans are hassling me!

11:56.373 --> 11:58.134
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey...

11:58.300 --> 11:59.951
I still don't understand
why I'm not riding with Lew-Lew.

12:00.076 --> 12:02.004
I told you. He had some
things to take care of,

12:02.129 --> 12:03.839
so he asked me to
drive you to his house.

12:03.964 --> 12:05.457
Drive faster. I want
to get to the kitchen

12:05.582 --> 12:06.625
and make some fish sticks.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.147
Ooh, which one is ours?

12:11.313 --> 12:12.347
First thing I'm gonna do

12:12.472 --> 12:13.816
is plant some heirloom tomatoes
up in here.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.638
You're not gonna ruin my big day.

12:19.763 --> 12:21.574
That wedding is happening, damn it!

12:52.729 --> 12:54.173
Brian, it's Stan.

12:54.298 --> 12:55.507
I wanted to tell you

12:55.632 --> 12:58.100
that Tracy won't be bothering us
anymore.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.031
Hello, white cheese.

13:02.197 --> 13:03.491
But I killed you!

13:03.657 --> 13:05.017
You can't kill this love.

13:05.142 --> 13:07.519
What we got here
is the eternal flame.

13:07.644 --> 13:10.906
The Bangles, bi-atch, circa '87!

13:11.031 --> 13:13.375
No! You're supposed
to be on the wagon,

13:13.500 --> 13:16.003
not drinking toilet wine
with your prison wife!

13:16.236 --> 13:18.280
Look, I love Ellen,

13:18.405 --> 13:21.049
but seeing Tracy stirred up
feelings I thought were gone.

13:21.174 --> 13:22.851
We had some great times together.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.987
He knows me so well.

13:25.112 --> 13:27.156
I was afraid of dying alone.

13:27.281 --> 13:29.324
Maybe now I don't have to.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.959
This isn't a real marriage!

13:31.084 --> 13:32.628
You are getting
real-married to Ellen,

13:32.753 --> 13:35.397
and I'm going to be best man!

13:35.522 --> 13:37.132
This is prison marriage, bitch!

13:38.892 --> 13:40.035
This is prison rules!

13:42.404 --> 13:44.907
<i>Hmm. Prison rules.</i>

13:45.073 --> 13:46.208
I love Brian Lewis.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.150
My heart is his forever.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.633
Where we goin'?

13:54.758 --> 13:56.168
Our house to watch movies?

13:56.293 --> 13:58.170
Uh, what's happening?

13:58.295 --> 14:01.573
Since I beat you up,
Tracy becomes my bitch now.

14:01.698 --> 14:03.509
You know they made four <i>Free Willies?</i>

14:03.634 --> 14:06.302
How'd that fat water fool let
himself get caught four times?

14:12.528 --> 14:13.605
Hey, cooking bitch.

14:13.730 --> 14:15.373
Hey! Cookin' bitch!

14:15.498 --> 14:16.941
What you cookin'?

14:17.066 --> 14:18.142
Egg whites?

14:18.267 --> 14:20.026
I'm gonna kill you!

14:20.192 --> 14:22.497
Um... what's going on?

14:22.622 --> 14:23.779
I'm super afraid!

14:24.023 --> 14:27.051
So, Stan, how long
is your friend going

14:27.176 --> 14:28.553
to be staying with us?

14:28.678 --> 14:30.479
Just until after Lewis gets married.

14:31.714 --> 14:34.309
Oh, we need salt.

14:37.959 --> 14:40.565
Stan, I know

14:40.690 --> 14:43.117
how much being a best
man means to you,

14:43.242 --> 14:45.553
but your friend keeps stabbing me.

14:45.678 --> 14:49.138
I just need my bitches to get
along for a couple more days.

14:49.304 --> 14:50.725
Just getting a Popsicle!

14:52.285 --> 14:56.103
Marmalade...
for the table?

14:59.826 --> 15:01.936
Last night was horrible, Steven!

15:02.061 --> 15:03.986
It was theorst night of my life!

15:06.099 --> 15:08.476
<i>If I had known there
was someone as beautiful</i>

15:08.601 --> 15:11.546
<i>as you out there, I would have
come out so much sooner.</i>

15:11.671 --> 15:14.482
Take off your shorts, <i>mi amor.</i>

15:14.607 --> 15:16.499
Uh... let's just make out some more.

15:16.665 --> 15:21.212
But Roger, it's clearly time
for butt play!

15:21.378 --> 15:22.924
The worst part is,

15:23.049 --> 15:25.209
I felt like Ricky Martin
and I had a connection.

15:25.334 --> 15:26.627
Well, Roger, if that's true,

15:26.752 --> 15:29.030
then you shouldn't be afraid
to take your shorts off.

15:29.155 --> 15:30.631
Your looks open the door,

15:30.756 --> 15:33.724
but your personality
takes the door off its hinges.

15:33.890 --> 15:35.336
Like the bathrooms at the beach?

15:35.461 --> 15:36.771
Mm-hmm.

15:36.896 --> 15:39.707
Do they do that so the bums
won't have sex in there?

15:39.832 --> 15:41.075
Mm-hmm.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.150
That's really smart.
Mm-hmm.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.081
Thanks for coming.

15:47.206 --> 15:49.617
We four are the most important
members in the wedding:

15:49.742 --> 15:51.953
best man, groom,
bride and flower girl.

15:52.078 --> 15:54.704
I thought my niece was
going to be the flower girl.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.357
No, your niece was not attractive.

15:56.482 --> 15:59.193
But Ashley here has won
a regional beauty pageant.

15:59.318 --> 16:00.795
I think it's horrible

16:00.920 --> 16:03.464
the way we treat marine
life in this country.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.333
Now I'm going to play the flute.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.216
â™ª â™ª

16:07.382 --> 16:08.586
Atta girl.

16:08.711 --> 16:10.438
Brian, you and Ashley
go practice dancing

16:10.563 --> 16:11.989
with her standing on your feet.

16:12.114 --> 16:14.664
It'll be adorable,
a real crowd pleaser.

16:16.853 --> 16:18.730
I'm glad we have
some alone time, Ellen.

16:18.855 --> 16:21.632
I'm working on my speech and
wanted to ask a few questions.

16:21.757 --> 16:23.067
Sure. Shoot.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.670
When was the moment you realized
you wanted to marry Brian?

16:25.795 --> 16:27.739
When I realized I wanted a baby.

16:27.864 --> 16:29.207
Oh. Okay.

16:29.332 --> 16:31.376
And what do you love most about him?

16:31.501 --> 16:33.611
That he has a penis full
of baby ingredients.

16:33.736 --> 16:34.869
Oh.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.230
Here's the deal.

16:36.355 --> 16:38.699
I want to marry Brian
and have a baby with him

16:38.824 --> 16:40.935
because it will help me get
to my ultimate goal...

16:41.060 --> 16:42.084
City Comptroller.

16:42.250 --> 16:42.752
What?!

16:42.918 --> 16:43.938
I've been accused

16:44.063 --> 16:45.306
of two things:

16:45.431 --> 16:47.358
not liking blacks
and not liking kids.

16:47.483 --> 16:49.394
Getting married to Brian,
an educator,

16:49.519 --> 16:52.163
and having a half-black baby
is exactly what I need

16:52.288 --> 16:54.932
to get out of this
superintendent dead end.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.635
There will be no limit
to how far I can go.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.587
The locks on a lot of doors

16:59.712 --> 17:04.022
in this city are
mulatto baby-shaped, Stan.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.483
Why are you telling me all this?!

17:05.701 --> 17:08.279
We're both using Brian
to get what we want.

17:08.404 --> 17:09.714
You won't say anything.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.116
This wedding is too important to us.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.201
Ashley's doing the splits
for a cigarette.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.369
Unfiltered, if you have it.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.872
â™ª â™ª

17:21.000 --> 17:23.044
Hello, Ricky Martin.

17:23.169 --> 17:24.878
You're looking <i>guapo,</i> as usual.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.146
Don't say a word.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.949
I have to be honest with you!

17:28.074 --> 17:29.131
What is it, Roger?

17:29.375 --> 17:31.252
I didn't take my shorts off
last night

17:31.377 --> 17:33.621
because I didn't want you
to see the real me.

17:33.746 --> 17:34.789
But I'm ready now.

17:34.914 --> 17:36.090
I really like you,

17:36.215 --> 17:38.307
and I hope you'll still
really like me, too.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.620
Okay.

17:43.311 --> 17:45.366
You...

17:45.491 --> 17:47.418
are even more beautiful to me now

17:47.543 --> 17:49.318
because it is the real you.

17:49.484 --> 17:50.905
This is it, isn't it?

17:51.030 --> 17:52.373
This is the real thing.

17:52.498 --> 17:54.375
Yes. It is.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.410
Especially because
I have a secret of my own.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.614
I, too, found an old blind woman

17:59.739 --> 18:01.580
behind a small door inside a Ross.

18:01.746 --> 18:03.624
Oh, you shop at Ross.

18:03.843 --> 18:06.254
The woman made me the T-shirt
that I am wearing.

18:06.379 --> 18:07.722
That was nine years ago.

18:07.847 --> 18:09.690
I have been afraid to take it off

18:09.815 --> 18:11.659
in front of another person
ever since.

18:11.784 --> 18:15.261
But your love has finally
given me the guts to do it.

18:19.775 --> 18:21.851
Grab!
No!

18:22.017 --> 18:23.828
â™ª â™ª

18:32.611 --> 18:34.389
â™ª â™ª

18:48.877 --> 18:50.421
â™ª â™ª

18:52.758 --> 18:54.235
Is that the real Mrs. Garrett?

18:54.360 --> 18:55.820
Oh, there's the
inspiration for Kimberly!

18:55.945 --> 18:57.355
Mr. Drummond was a man of means,

18:57.480 --> 18:58.888
so this should be a nice wedding!

18:59.054 --> 19:00.890
This is a beautiful wedding.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.243
Yes, it certainly...

19:03.803 --> 19:07.021
Uh. Switch seats with me?

19:07.187 --> 19:10.351
Welcome. I'm Stan Smith,
your best man!

19:10.476 --> 19:12.436
First up, the bride and groom
will read

19:12.561 --> 19:14.789
their vows to each other,
which will be boring,

19:14.914 --> 19:16.798
but then, your best man
will be right back!

19:18.448 --> 19:19.760
Mr. Drummond, right?

19:19.885 --> 19:22.620
Mr. Druffold, but you
can call me Mr. D.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.932
Look at that.
True love, huh?

19:25.057 --> 19:26.500
Well, true love...

19:26.625 --> 19:28.292
is that really important?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.837
It's everything.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.405
After Kimberly's mother passed,

19:31.530 --> 19:33.241
I almost remarried the wrong woman.

19:33.366 --> 19:35.109
Turns out she had a secret agenda

19:35.234 --> 19:37.144
to ship the kids off
to a boarding school.

19:37.269 --> 19:38.479
Wait. I saw that episode.

19:38.604 --> 19:41.616
Season one, episode 12... "The Woman."

19:41.741 --> 19:44.558
But luckily, a good friend of
mine was looking out for me.

19:46.345 --> 19:49.271
It's hard to know what the right
thing is sometimes, Mr. D.

19:49.515 --> 19:51.142
Well, how does your heart feel?

19:51.267 --> 19:52.610
My heart hurts.

19:52.735 --> 19:54.469
Well, I think you have your answer.

19:56.611 --> 19:57.696
Stop!

20:00.009 --> 20:01.385
Brian, you can't marry that woman!

20:01.510 --> 20:03.020
What you talkin' 'bout, Stan?!

20:03.145 --> 20:04.488
- Yeah!
- All right!

20:04.613 --> 20:06.257
- All right, yeah.
- Oh, finally.

20:06.382 --> 20:08.374
She's a horrible person!

20:08.540 --> 20:11.762
I was trying to force this union
so I could have my big day,

20:11.887 --> 20:14.081
but I've realized
there's something more important

20:14.206 --> 20:15.783
than being a best man.

20:15.908 --> 20:18.653
I think I have to go to the hospital.

20:18.778 --> 20:20.886
And that's being a better friend.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.457
I was wrong to try and change you.

20:23.582 --> 20:26.127
So go on. Do what
you were born to do.

20:26.252 --> 20:28.310
Go punch that dog in the face.

20:28.476 --> 20:29.311
Huh?

20:30.423 --> 20:32.290
You're a good friend.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.498
You ruined everything!

20:47.623 --> 20:49.600
Now how will I get my half-black baby

20:49.725 --> 20:51.218
and become City Comptroller?!

20:51.343 --> 20:52.887
Where we goin'?

20:53.012 --> 20:54.338
Our house to take a bubble bath?

20:54.463 --> 20:55.873
What?
Prison rules, girl.

20:55.998 --> 20:58.465
You beat up my husband,
so I'm your bitch now.
