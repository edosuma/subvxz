-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.433
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.000
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.033 --> 00:42.233
in a court of law.

00:42.267 --> 00:46.167
-I love Springfield.
It's kind of a tricky city.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.167
It's somewhat large
but somewhat small.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.967
It still has that
small town feel,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.833
but we still get
a lot of crime

00:52.867 --> 00:55.467
and a lot of things to keep
an officer busy.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.400
So it kind of has
a small town feel

00:57.433 --> 00:59.667
and a big city feel
at the same time.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.667
I just ran the license plate
of this truck

01:03.700 --> 01:05.567
and I'm gonna get it
stopped here in just a second.

01:05.600 --> 01:10.733
Shows that the registered owner
of the vehicle has a warrant.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.933
211. Traffic stop
at Scenic and Page.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.633
Have a subject with
possible warrant.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.067
Can you start me a code one?

01:22.100 --> 01:24.500
Man on Radio:
Any unit available,
code one, Scenic and Page.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.933
-How's it going, sir?
-Good. How are you?

01:28.967 --> 01:30.200
-Pretty good.
Why'd you pull me over?

01:30.233 --> 01:33.100
-Um, well, it looks like
you might have a warrant.

01:33.133 --> 01:34.333
You know anything about that?

01:34.367 --> 01:35.433
-No, I do not.

01:35.467 --> 01:36.867
-Is this your current
address here on Page?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.300
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah?

01:38.333 --> 01:40.933
I ran your plate and your name
and you've got a warrant.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.933
-For what?
-That's what I'm checking on.

01:42.967 --> 01:45.067
-But how does
a warrant come up

01:45.067 --> 01:46.767
and you don't
even know about it?

01:46.800 --> 01:47.833
-What do you mean?

01:47.867 --> 01:49.233
-You said it popped up.

01:49.267 --> 01:50.800
-Yeah. It's on the computer.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.533
-Then what'd it say?

01:52.567 --> 01:54.467
-I haven't gone back there
to see what it said.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.500
You turned and I lit you up.
-You were just in
there checking.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.600
That's why you pulled me over.
-Yes, 'cause you have a warrant.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.700
-Yeah, but you don't know--
-It doesn't matter
what it's for.

02:00.733 --> 02:02.267
If you got a warrant,
you got a warrant.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.433
-Are you just saying that?

02:03.467 --> 02:05.333
Because you can't even answer
what it's for.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.433
-I'm checking with
the dispatcher so they can
verify that it's active.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.233
-Are you harassing me?
-(laughs)

02:10.267 --> 02:12.633
-Is it because I'm brown?

02:17.067 --> 02:18.967
That you think I'm-- What?

02:19.067 --> 02:23.067
Is it-- Are you
being racist right now?

02:23.067 --> 02:26.600
-Have I said anything that
indicates anything about racism?

02:26.633 --> 02:29.567
-I mean, I'm just asking, sir,
so I know.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.300
So I'm aware of it.
And you're not answering.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.800
-You're the one that brought
it up, not me.

02:32.833 --> 02:35.767
-Yeah, I am. 'Cause I'm
asking a question.
-Go ahead...

02:35.800 --> 02:38.133
Okay, the dispatcher
just confirmed it.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.667
All right,
do me a favor, step out.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.067
-No. Do not open my door.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.700
-Get out of the car.
-Do not open my--

02:42.733 --> 02:44.200
Do not hurt me.
-Get out of the car.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.500
-Why?
-Step out of the car.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.733
-Why?
-You're under arrest.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.200
-Why?
-Step out of the car.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.467
-Stop harassing me.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.800
-Okay, you're--
Stop, I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.367
-What--
-Get out of the car.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.767
-You hurt me.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
Hurt me.

02:56.833 --> 02:57.967
Hurt me.
-I'm not hurting you.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.267
-Oww.
-You're resisting arrest.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.067
-Yeah, break my arm.
-Put your arm behind your back.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.167
-I'm not resisting.
I'm not resisting one bit.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.667
You see that, sir?
I'm not resisting.
-Then quit pulling your arm.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.067
-No, I'm not. You are.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.300
You're pulling my arm up.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.467
-Stay in the car.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.433
-You had no right
to pull me out of the vehicle--
-Sit up.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.200
-You had no right
to open my (bleep) door.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.933
-He's got some
drugs in the seat there.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.500
-Oww! What the (bleep)!

03:24.633 --> 03:26.367
Ugh.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.100
You had no right
to pull me out like that.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.400
-Well, you're under arrest.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.933
-And I want to press
charges against you.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.267
-Okay. We can do that.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.433
-You beat me--
You beat my ass.

03:34.467 --> 03:35.867
-(laughs)

03:35.900 --> 03:37.367
Are you hurt?
-Yeah, I'm hurt.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.267
My elbows.
My side of my face.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.467
-There's a pipe or something
that fell out of his pocket.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.800
Mind, before it
gets ran over.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.433
-You had no right to pull
me out of the vehicle.
-Yes, I did.

03:48.467 --> 03:49.933
You have a warrant.
-You pulled me out.

03:49.967 --> 03:51.933
-You have a warrant
for insurance.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.067
-Insurance? I have insurance.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.767
-You're not listening.
-I already went to court.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.700
-Okay. Is that a pipe?

03:57.733 --> 04:01.233
Yeah. It fell out of his pocket,
I think, when we hit the ground.

04:01.267 --> 04:02.667
What was in the seat?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.933
-There was some meth and there
was some weed in there, too.

04:04.967 --> 04:07.500
-Okay.
-You harassed me!
Because I don't know my rights.

04:07.533 --> 04:09.300
-We're gonna go back in
this officer's car right here.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.933
-I don't know my rights
or anything like that?

04:10.967 --> 04:13.433
-But I have the right to stop
you when you have a warrant.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.267
-I want the ambulance here.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.633
Please, I want it.
-Okay. For what?

04:17.667 --> 04:19.067
I want a licensed
physician here.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.067
-Okay.
-Right now.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.800
-What do you need
an ambulance for?

04:21.833 --> 04:22.833
-Because I'm hurt.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.433
-What hurts?
Tell me what hurts?

04:24.467 --> 04:25.733
-The injustice here.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.133
-The injustice hurts?
-Yeah, yeah.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.900
-Well, I'm sorry they don't
make an ambulance for that,

04:28.933 --> 04:30.833
so why don't you go ahead
and have a seat in the car?

04:30.867 --> 04:32.800
-They make the law, right?
-Yeah.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.400
-Court, right?
-Yup.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.800
But there's not an ambulance
for injustice, man.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.400
-Can I get an ambulance here?
-Nope.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.833
-My elbows are scratched up.
My side hurts.

04:40.867 --> 04:43.733
-You got hurt because
you resisted arrest.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.933
-What? I wasn't-- Why?
What warrant?

04:45.967 --> 04:48.133
-When he asked you to get out,
you should have got out.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.800
-What warrant was he arresting
me? What warrant?

04:49.833 --> 04:51.900
-You got drugs in the car.
-You'll be kicked off
the force, sir.

04:51.933 --> 04:53.200
-You got a warrant.
-Re-take your test.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.500
-You got-- (laughs)
-Re-take your test.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.900
-I've been a cop
for eight years, brother.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.233
-Oh, yeah?
-Yep.

04:57.267 --> 04:58.867
Okay. I'm gonna search
your car.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.700
Is there anything else
illegal in there?

05:00.733 --> 05:04.100
-No, you may not search
that car, 'cause the keys
are not in the ignition and--

05:04.133 --> 05:07.400
-Apparently keys have to be
in the ignition to search a car.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.833
Dispatch has just told me

05:09.867 --> 05:11.933
that he's got another--
a second warrant

05:11.967 --> 05:13.267
with a $500 bond.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.700
So not only will he be going
to jail for the first warrant,

05:15.733 --> 05:17.500
but now he has two.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.600
Along with charges of
resisting arrest,

05:19.633 --> 05:21.367
possession of marijuana,

05:21.400 --> 05:24.500
and the felony for
the methamphetamine.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.400
-Officer, that's
my son's truck.
-Okay.

05:26.433 --> 05:28.067
So Marcos is your son?
-Yeah.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.833
-Okay. My name's
Officer Compton with
Springfield Police Department.

05:30.867 --> 05:33.633
-Okay.
-Marcos has
a couple warrants.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.967
I pulled him over
'cause he had a couple warrants,

05:36.067 --> 05:37.800
and he had a couple
drugs on him too.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.633
So that's kind of what
we're looking at today.

05:39.667 --> 05:43.167
How is he normally?
Is he normally aggressive
or anything?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.800
-Normally a good kid.
-Okay.

05:44.833 --> 05:48.100
Well, he wasn't really wanting
to cooperate with us today.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.800
You mind coming down
and talking to him?
-Sure.

05:49.833 --> 05:50.867
I can try.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.067
-And try to get him
to cooperate with us.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.767
Hey bud, your mom's here
to talk to you.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.100
-(inaudible)

05:58.133 --> 05:59.767
-Do what?
-What's up?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.200
-Just calm down.

06:01.233 --> 06:04.533
If you calm down, you won't
be charged with all the stuff.

06:04.567 --> 06:08.400
If you cooperate.
Just cooperate.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.933
-They have no right
to do what they did.

06:09.967 --> 06:12.067
It was illegal.
They harassed me.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.100
-You had warrants.

06:13.133 --> 06:14.867
-What warrant?
He couldn't even answer.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.833
-The two--
One with the plates,

06:16.867 --> 06:18.767
and the insurance
that never got taken off.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.833
-You, too?

06:19.867 --> 06:21.500
-Listen, you had meth,
you had weed.

06:21.533 --> 06:23.133
I don't have to charge you
with everything.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.367
But if you don't
cooperate with me,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.800
then you're gonna catch
it all, you understand that?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.300
-I want my lawyer
here right now.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.800
-Just calm down.
-I want my--

06:31.833 --> 06:33.200
I'm not even yelling, Mom.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.133
-I know that.
But just calm down.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.900
-You want to tell Mom
anything before we go?

06:36.933 --> 06:39.667
-Yeah. Get my lawyer.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.867
Right now.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.400
-Yeah, he's definitely
not good.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.467
-So that's not
how he normally acts?
-No.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.667
-All right. Well,
we're gonna take him down
to Greene County jail.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.767
Depending on his cooperation
from this point forward,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.333
he'll go to jail
for the warrants,

06:52.367 --> 06:54.633
and resisting arrest,

06:54.667 --> 06:57.567
and another felony
possession of methamphetamine.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.367
-We're the special duty unit.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.500
We're kind of the utility unit
of our department.

07:04.533 --> 07:07.433
Somebody needs a team to go help
them do a search warrant,

07:07.467 --> 07:09.067
they need more bodies
to go do it,

07:09.100 --> 07:10.733
they always kinda
call on us.

07:10.767 --> 07:12.500
We'll go do a search
warrant with them.

07:12.533 --> 07:16.567
Got a lot of guys in our unit
that work our SWAT team.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.333
So there's a lot of experience
that we bring along.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.067
We'll help with pretty much
any investigations.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.367
-We're gonna stop this car
ahead of us

07:24.400 --> 07:27.633
because this plate that's on the
car is showing lost or stolen.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.800
And usually sometimes suspects,
what they'll do

07:29.833 --> 07:32.233
once they steal a car, they'll
put another plate on there.

07:32.267 --> 07:34.067
So we're gonna go ahead
and contact

07:34.100 --> 07:36.467
to see if this car's
a stolen vehicle or not.

07:38.100 --> 07:42.333
-(radio chatter)

07:42.367 --> 07:45.567
-Woman on radio:
2016 Honda...

07:45.600 --> 07:47.500
-How you doing?
-How you doing?

07:47.533 --> 07:48.900
-You're driving
without your lights on.

07:48.933 --> 07:50.533
Do you have
a driver's license?

07:50.567 --> 07:52.433
-Yeah.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.233
-All right. Here.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.667
-He's just dropping me off, bro.
-Cannabis card.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.233
How much weed's in the car?

08:02.267 --> 08:03.700
-This is not even
my car, though.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.600
Like, I don't know
what's inside.
-Okay. That's all right.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.433
No, you can leave your key
in there. Just set it there.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.733
Why don't you put all your stuff
on the dash for me?

08:10.767 --> 08:12.867
Go ahead and step out
facing away from me.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.333
-One at a time.
-Step out.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.767
-What did you put in there?

08:19.667 --> 08:20.933
-Can you take my wig off?

08:20.967 --> 08:22.567
-Take your wig off?
-Yeah.

08:23.833 --> 08:24.967
-You got anything under it?

08:25.067 --> 08:26.633
-No, hell no.
I was just wearing it 'cause...

08:26.667 --> 08:27.700
-Okay.

08:27.733 --> 08:29.100
-Yeah, sorry about that.
-All right.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.933
All right.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.433
-Come with me.
-All right.

08:33.467 --> 08:38.300
-10-26...
(indistinct)

08:38.333 --> 08:39.767
-All right, man.
Come out for a second.

08:41.367 --> 08:43.067
Same thing. Face away.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.167
Now I'm gonna just
search the car.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.667
And... so this is
a methamphetamine pipe

08:49.700 --> 08:53.067
they use for smoking
the methamphetamine right here.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.367
Got a little bit
of marijuana.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.767
-The owner of the car
is down the street.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.433
The guy is selling the car
for 5,000 bucks.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.533
And he was like, "Hey, you guys
can test drive it if you want."

09:03.567 --> 09:06.333
And I'm like, all right.
So I was gonna give him 5,000.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.733
He's right around the corner.

09:07.767 --> 09:08.867
-Where's right
around the corner?

09:08.900 --> 09:10.333
Like, right down Smalley.

09:10.367 --> 09:11.533
-What's the address?

09:11.567 --> 09:15.633
-I think it's 20-- 20, uh,
29, 26, 4.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.233
-29264?

09:17.267 --> 09:19.067
-I think that's--
-Okay, that doesn't make sense.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.700
If it's right around the corner,
it's not a five digit address.
-I didn't even--

09:21.733 --> 09:23.233
I didn't even pay
attention to the address.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.900
All I know--
I can point you to the house.

09:24.933 --> 09:26.667
I know what--

09:26.700 --> 09:28.667
what the owner looks like.
It's a Chinese guy.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.267
Ali something...

09:30.300 --> 09:33.833
Um, Ali... Ali?

09:33.867 --> 09:38.767
Um, no, it--
Andre. Andre something.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.133
-So the car is a stolen vehicle.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.300
Neither of the license
plates match the vehicle.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.533
VIN number is
what actually told the tale.

09:46.567 --> 09:49.467
It's stolen out of Hayward,
just right up the street here.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.533
-Anything else in that car
I need to know about?

09:51.567 --> 09:54.067
-I don't know.
He just got up for
a ride 'cause it was raining.

09:54.067 --> 09:55.700
Down the street right here.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.867
And that was it. I just got in
and jumped in the back seat.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.267
-Talk about where
you were sitting.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.833
So if I go search
that car--

10:00.867 --> 10:03.867
-Go ahead.
-I'm not gonna find no dope
or no guns there, right?

10:03.900 --> 10:05.133
-Where I was sitting? No.
-Yes.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.133
-All right.
-Guarantee it.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.767
-We got a mask.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.667
Kinda going along
with the story of the wig.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.833
And then inside here
got a couple more masks.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.567
Looks like--
Oh, maybe that's just paper.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.300
But this one,
definitely a mask.

10:18.333 --> 10:22.100
Also found a shotgun shell
in this coat pocket.

10:22.133 --> 10:25.367
Which leads me to believe

10:25.400 --> 10:27.033
that there's probably
a gun around.

10:29.300 --> 10:33.100
So they're probably
robbing people.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.900
Using the mask
to kind of cover themselves.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.167
And another methamphetamine
pipe in here.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.000
Probably a gun in the trunk

10:44.033 --> 10:46.433
since we found that
ammunition in the front.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.533
He saw us
playing with it, which...

10:48.567 --> 10:50.633
There's a sawed-off
shotgun right there.

10:56.600 --> 11:03.200
And it's got one in the chamber.
So, go ahead and remove that.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.433
Oh. They ground
the serial number off.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.667
So it's obviously a stolen gun.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.867
Serial number
would be right there.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.833
-What would be
the charges then?

11:14.867 --> 11:16.867
For me?
If I'm just a passenger?

11:16.900 --> 11:20.167
-It could go possession
of stolen property.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.533
There's a bunch of things
that can happen, right?

11:22.567 --> 11:24.100
There's a bunch
of dope in the car.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.800
This whole situation's
not good, right?

11:25.833 --> 11:26.900
-Yeah, it's not.
-It's bad.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.467
-It is.
-So--

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
-Look at me, I swear to you,
I didn't know that gun
was in there.

11:30.533 --> 11:31.967
-That's okay. I mean...

11:32.067 --> 11:34.167
-You know what, I should have
rode my damn bike, bro.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.733
-Should have.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.367
So, all right, man.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.300
So at this point I'm gonna
go ahead and cut you loose.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.500
Um, get your stuff
and we'll get--

11:43.533 --> 11:45.200
-I'm sorry, dude.
-No problem.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.633
-I don't-- don't want to give
you guys a hard time.
-No big deal, right?

11:49.233 --> 11:51.067
All right, man.
Go ahead and grab your stuff.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.067
You're free to go.
-Thank you.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.233
-All right.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.967
All right, man. So at this point
you're under arrest.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.500
-Okay, look. First of all,
can I say something?
-Go ahead.

11:59.533 --> 12:02.067
-I got the right to say
the truth and nothing
but the truth.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.333
There's a check of the owner
inside that car.

12:04.367 --> 12:08.167
Okay? His name is-- whatever
his name is is inside there
in the check, okay?

12:08.200 --> 12:11.167
Look at the check, and then
you'll see he's a drug addict,
all right?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.900
He's a drug addict
and he told us

12:12.933 --> 12:14.733
he was selling the car
for $5,000

12:14.767 --> 12:16.500
and that's it.

12:16.533 --> 12:18.067
So I'm like,
"All right, what's in the car?"

12:18.067 --> 12:21.567
He's like, "nothing, just
a little bit of dope and weed."

12:21.600 --> 12:24.200
But I was like, "All right,
I got a cannabis card.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.567
"So don't even worry.
You know, they won't
charge me for the weed."

12:26.600 --> 12:28.167
-He tell you
there's a gun in the car?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.433
-He didn't tell me that!
That's what I'm telling you!
-No? Okay.

12:30.467 --> 12:34.367
-All right? All I know is that
it was all a setup.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.967
-It's all--
They set you up, huh?

12:37.067 --> 12:39.600
Real quick. You're being
arrested for the stolen car.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.933
You're being arrested
for the firearm that's cut off.

12:41.967 --> 12:43.700
-It's not even mine though!

12:43.733 --> 12:45.433
-You're in possession
of it, though.

12:45.467 --> 12:48.067
-How am I possessing it when
I'm just test driving the car?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.600
-You're driving the car.

12:49.633 --> 12:51.267
There's dope in the car.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.800
The marijuana-- Hold on.
-Exactly, but that--

12:52.833 --> 12:54.100
-Listen to me.
You're not listening.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.367
Methamphetamines,
weed in the car,

12:56.400 --> 12:57.833
you got a sawed-off shotgun

12:57.867 --> 12:59.467
sitting in the trunk
that's fully loaded.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.067
You got pipes
everywhere in the car.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.667
So at this point, that's what
you're being charged with,
all right?

13:05.700 --> 13:06.867
All right.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.067
-He's in a stolen car
with a wig on.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.167
He could try to disguise
himself to do another crime.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.167
So very good stop.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.100
'Cause the sawed-off shotgun
is bad news on these streets.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.300
-Being around here long enough,

13:23.333 --> 13:24.867
you kinda get to pick
where you want to work.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.067
And I enjoy
the east side of the city.
And I like it the best, I think,

13:27.100 --> 13:29.300
because they refer to themselves
by their zip code.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.133
The "seventeeners."

13:31.167 --> 13:34.067
And if there's one thing
the seventeeners are proud of,
and wear it on their chest,

13:34.100 --> 13:36.233
is they're happy to be
on that east side.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.067
So I'm happy to be there too.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.900
-Woman on radio:
The homeowner called, and she
took a call from a neighbor...

13:40.933 --> 13:42.667
-We just got sent to a--

13:42.700 --> 13:44.200
what's called
a burglary in progress.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.900
Someone called and said people
were breaking into the house.

13:46.933 --> 13:51.900
And... this might
be it right here.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.533
-(radio chatter)

13:56.567 --> 13:59.133
-Whose house is this?
Turn off the car.

13:59.167 --> 14:00.633
-Whose house is this?
-My dad's.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.600
-And whose inside right now?
-My uncle.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.767
-Somebody's inside
right there, too.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.633
Give me the keys from the car.
Do you live here?

14:06.667 --> 14:07.767
-My dad does.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.967
-Where's your dad at?

14:09.067 --> 14:12.233
-He, I guess he just turned
himself into Bethel...

14:12.267 --> 14:14.567
-Watch her.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.533
Come out. Show me your hand.
Show me your hand!

14:16.567 --> 14:18.267
Show me your hands!
Step out!

14:18.300 --> 14:20.133
-I live here, brother.
-Walk down!

14:20.167 --> 14:22.167
Turn around, put your hands
on top of your head. Now!

14:22.200 --> 14:23.467
-Now!
-Yup.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.233
-Put your hand on top
of your head.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.067
-(radio chatter)

14:27.067 --> 14:28.533
-Somebody just
walked out on us.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.733
He says he lives here. We're not
getting straight stories.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.533
-My niece was trying to get
in the house. I was sleeping.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.067
Let me call my mother.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.467
-She's the one who called us.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.600
Why would she call
and say someone was
breaking into her house?

14:42.633 --> 14:44.900
-'Cause somebody seen her
jumping in the window, man.

14:44.933 --> 14:47.067
-Who jumped in the window?
-My niece.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.567
-Why would she
jump in the window?

14:48.600 --> 14:51.600
-Because I had the door locked.
I was sleeping, bro.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.900
I live here daily, man.
Ask my neighbors.

14:53.933 --> 14:55.833
-That's fine.
We'll figure it all out.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.600
But why would your niece
jump in the window?

14:57.633 --> 14:59.433
-I don't know.
Ask her that, okay.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.200
-That's what I am
gonna ask her.
-All right.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.533
-You understand
why we're doing this.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.133
Because your mother
just ca-- Listen.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.333
Your mother called--

15:05.367 --> 15:06.633
-She was just here today.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.233
-She just called us

15:08.267 --> 15:10.500
and said people were
breaking into her house.

15:10.533 --> 15:11.767
So that's why we're here.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.600
-Okay. And I understand.
-And then when you-- Listen.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.467
-The neighbors
probably called her.
-Listen. That's fine.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.200
And we'll figure it all out,
but here's the deal.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.933
When you come out of that door
and your hands
are behind your back,

15:19.967 --> 15:22.133
do you understand why
that bothers guys like me?

15:22.167 --> 15:25.133
-You know what,
it bothers me that you guys
bother people like me!

15:25.167 --> 15:26.433
-What am I bothering you for?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.067
-I don't bother nobody, man!
-I didn't say you did,

15:28.067 --> 15:29.733
and when we figure it all out,
you're good to go.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.700
But right now you don't have
any identification on you,

15:31.733 --> 15:33.833
and your mother called
and said that you guys
broke in the house.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.067
And you don't have ID
on you, do you?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.833
Let's step out front.
Figure it all out.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.267
Is there anybody else in there?
-No.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.367
-Come here. Sit down on
the steps for me, brother.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.800
Did you crawl in the window?

15:41.833 --> 15:44.733
-No. I threw my keys
at the window so it
would hit something

15:44.767 --> 15:46.500
and I was yelling through
the window.

15:46.533 --> 15:49.067
-Okay.
-And then he
heard that I was here

15:49.100 --> 15:50.600
and came and let me in.
-Call my mom.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.467
-Your mom is
the one who called.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.333
Did you run her?
-Yeah, they're all tied up.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.433
-Somebody probably called her
because she was just here today.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.367
-Did you say grandma?
-Guys!

15:58.400 --> 16:00.733
Did you call the cops?
-No.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.200
-Now why would
somebody do that?!

16:03.233 --> 16:05.933
-I just got home!
-I was (bleep) sleeping, man!

16:05.967 --> 16:07.833
She was jumping
through the window.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.133
-You said your first
name was Michael?

16:09.167 --> 16:11.067
-Don't let me find out!

16:11.067 --> 16:12.400
I don't mess with no--
-Hey.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.800
Why are you
making threats, Michael?

16:13.833 --> 16:16.067
-Because, man,
this is bull crap!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
-You can't be
making threats, though.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.300
-All right. I'm just saying.
-Michael, focus on me.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.800
Stephanie, if you'd like
to get out

16:21.833 --> 16:23.500
and sit on the fender
of your car, you may.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.333
At the moment
you're being detained.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.367
-My mom's coming?
-Yeah, your mom's coming.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.433
You just drove all the way
over here to get cereal?

16:29.467 --> 16:32.267
-No, I drove all the way
over here to see
if my dad was here.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.767
-Okay.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.333
-And to see if
my uncle was okay.

16:35.367 --> 16:37.100
-I believe you.
-That's my brother's kid.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.533
Why would you have a problem
with a kid coming over?

16:39.567 --> 16:42.300
-I understand it.
-You know, my mom's
the way she is now, so...

16:42.333 --> 16:44.333
-All right.
We'll figure it all out.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.733
-What are you breaking
into the house for?

16:48.767 --> 16:50.267
-I wasn't breaking
into your house.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.633
-What are you doing?
-She was eating cereal.
She was hungry.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.867
-Okay, but that was after
I checked on him.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
-Oh, okay.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.533
-Yeah, she comes
here all the time

16:57.567 --> 16:59.133
to check up on her dad
and stuff.
-But--

16:59.167 --> 17:01.133
-And not only him, you, too!

17:01.167 --> 17:03.800
-This is your home. Why would
I have found him inside there?

17:03.833 --> 17:05.800
-I need to get
everybody out of here,

17:05.833 --> 17:08.867
and I had him out here
a few months ago.
-Mom...

17:08.900 --> 17:10.767
-And he threw something at me.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.700
-Quit it.
-And I can't get him
out of the house.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.067
-Oh, you can't--
-Do you not
want him to live here anymore?

17:15.067 --> 17:17.467
-I'm trying to tell him
to find somewhere to go.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.067
-Okay.
-Okay then, so you're
doing it now?

17:20.100 --> 17:22.500
Is this what we're into, Mom?
-There--

17:22.533 --> 17:24.467
-This is...
-This is what I'm saying.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.933
Nobody'll do nothing
to help me.

17:25.967 --> 17:27.767
-What do you need,
and let's see what I can
do to help.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.800
-I just need him
to find a place to go.

17:29.833 --> 17:33.100
-Now, you understand
the legal process if you
do want him to go, correct?

17:33.133 --> 17:34.800
You have to get
an eviction notice.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.300
-I know, and I don't have
the time. I take care
of my mother, 80 years old.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.567
-I can see that. No,
I understand that.
You don't need this problem.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.400
-And I take care of my brother,
he's 57.

17:41.433 --> 17:42.600
-Is she supposed to be here?

17:42.633 --> 17:44.067
-None of 'em's
supposed to be here!

17:44.067 --> 17:46.200
I can't-- We don't
live here right now.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.967
-Okay.
-Me and my mother lives
clear out at Cutty's.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.933
-Here's what we're gonna do.
Stephanie, where's your ID?

17:51.433 --> 17:53.233
Do you still have it?
-You got it.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.700
-All right. We're gonna get it
back from you, and here's
what's gonna happen.

17:55.733 --> 17:57.967
You're now officially advised
to trespass from this location.

17:58.067 --> 18:00.200
Okay?
-Are you serious?
My dad lives here.

18:00.233 --> 18:02.300
-This is the homeowner.
-Your dad's not living here.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.667
He's down at the shelter.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.367
-Okay, but what about
when he comes back?!

18:05.400 --> 18:07.133
-He's at the shelter right now.
He's not coming back.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.100
-I just want you guys to go
and stay away for a while.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.733
-I'm getting my ID.
-Go ahead.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.267
-Woman on radio:
They have any local
charges on this guy?

18:15.300 --> 18:18.200
-Woman #2 on radio:
He comes back 99 on trespass.

18:18.233 --> 18:20.300
It's a nationwide extradition.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.067
-What?
Are you kidding me?

18:23.067 --> 18:25.100
-Woman #2:
I'm dead serious.

18:25.133 --> 18:26.467
-(Stephanie yelling)

18:26.500 --> 18:27.767
-Well, thanks a lot.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.833
-Okay. Hang on.
-Now I gotta go
to (bleep) jail.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.767
-Michael, apparently--
-Thanks a lot.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.267
-They want you on
the warrant. Come on down.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.133
-Yeah, I got a warrant
in Colorado.

18:35.167 --> 18:37.100
They're gonna come all the way
down here to get me.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.833
-Come on, buddy.
-I doubt that.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.233
-Apparently they're going to.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.533
-Are you serious?
On a trespassing charge?

18:42.567 --> 18:44.067
You're gonna do that
to a kid?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.700
You know what,
(bleep) you!

18:45.733 --> 18:47.533
-See. You guys hear him.
-You're gonna do that to--

18:47.567 --> 18:48.800
-Stop. Stop, stop.
Let's go.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.267
Okay. Let's put you in.
Calm you down for a minute.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.067
They must really want you
in Colorado, brother.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.267
-I guess, buddy.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.233
-All right. Have a seat
in there for me.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.800
-I ain't even do nothing
that was serious.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.200
-Have a seat. It's cool
in there. We'll get
the air running.

19:01.233 --> 19:03.767
Okay? But unless you get
these things handled--

19:03.800 --> 19:05.367
'Cause you can't keep
running away from them.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.833
'Cause you see
what happens today?

19:06.867 --> 19:09.533
Everybody gets upset.
Everybody's got a bad day.

19:09.567 --> 19:12.067
And if you get this stuff
handled and taken care of--

19:12.100 --> 19:13.733
I got a feeling
your mom loves you.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.533
And your mom wants
to help you out, right?

19:15.567 --> 19:17.433
-There's no making
that woman happy, man.

19:17.467 --> 19:18.667
-Well, let's see what happens.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.067
You get this
taken care of, all right?

19:20.067 --> 19:22.267
All right, buddy.
Swing your leg in.
Good luck to you, man.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.867
Okay, here's the deal.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.067
Your uncle, he's gonna head
back to Colorado.
'Cause they want him.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.067
You understand that if you
come back here you go to jail?

19:31.067 --> 19:33.067
-Yeah, I understand.
-All right. Here you go.
Turn on your car.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.533
Keep yourself cool.
-Yep.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.367
-We'll let you go here
when we move our cars
out of the way.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.667
-You see his attitude.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.067
-Yeah. He's probably
using some narcotics.
-Uh-huh.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.133
-You know, it'll probably
come back to bite me

19:42.167 --> 19:43.700
'cause he'll probably
hurt me now.

19:43.733 --> 19:45.967
-No. He's gonna go back
to Colorado. They're
coming to get him.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.733
So he's not gonna
come back here, all right?

19:47.767 --> 19:49.067
-Thank you.
-Yep.

19:50.133 --> 19:52.300
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.267
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.433
Cover is code three.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.433
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.267 --> 20:07.233
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.433
-(theme music playing)
