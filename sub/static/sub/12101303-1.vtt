00:00.310 --> 00:03.727
(tense orchestral music)

00:14.828 --> 00:17.726
(gunshot blasting)

00:17.726 --> 00:21.976
(tense orchestral music continues)

01:07.997 --> 01:11.085
(gunshot blasting)

01:11.085 --> 01:15.335
(tense orchestral music continues)

01:34.759 --> 01:36.784
(gunshot blasting)

01:36.784 --> 01:41.034
(tense orchestral music continues)

01:44.668 --> 01:47.851
(gunshot blasting)

01:47.851 --> 01:52.101
(tense orchestral music continues)

02:05.271 --> 02:10.271
(wind whirring)
(tense orchestral music)

02:10.555 --> 02:15.555
(feet scraping)
(man grunting)

02:16.564 --> 02:20.814
(tense orchestral music continues)

03:03.110 --> 03:08.110
(feet scraping)
(man grunting)

03:15.936 --> 03:20.186
(tense orchestral music continues)

03:35.144 --> 03:37.977
(knife whooshing)

03:39.768 --> 03:43.101
(tense music continues)

03:58.806 --> 04:03.806
(feet scraping)
(man gasping)

04:05.956 --> 04:09.289
(tense music continues)

04:21.800 --> 04:24.717
(knocking on door)

04:31.860 --> 04:33.160
- [Jonathan] Just hang on.

04:39.260 --> 04:40.093
What is this?

04:41.252 --> 04:42.850
Hanging's not till tomorrow.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.923
- Bob says now.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.490
- [Jonathan] Marshal's not even here.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.890
Lemmy, it's Sunday for God's sake.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.890
- Believe he's planning to get
it done before church starts.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.998
- I'll be out in a minute.

04:55.998 --> 04:56.948
Just wait out here.

04:58.015 --> 04:59.165
Mabel's still sleeping.

05:01.241 --> 05:03.658
(door slams)

05:08.340 --> 05:10.123
Bastard. Always gotta show off.

05:15.370 --> 05:17.470
I thought you'd be next to me when I woke.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.590
- Couldn't sleep.

05:24.540 --> 05:25.563
Not well, at least.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.960
- Bob's fixing to hang that
horse thief this morning.

05:35.860 --> 05:36.763
- It's Sunday.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.730
- My thoughts exactly.

05:44.490 --> 05:45.543
You best stay here.

05:48.310 --> 05:49.810
- I must get ready for church.

05:51.390 --> 05:52.890
- One week without won't hurt.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.223
Do as I say Mabel.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.970
I don't want you to see this.

06:02.452 --> 06:05.619
(church bell ringing)

06:13.530 --> 06:14.730
I'll be home for supper.

06:36.158 --> 06:37.222
(water splashing)

06:37.222 --> 06:40.305
(prisoner grumbling)

06:41.793 --> 06:42.680
- Thought you needed a bath

06:42.680 --> 06:46.703
before you went to meet
your maker. (chuckles)

06:47.616 --> 06:49.298
(man imitating choking)

06:49.298 --> 06:52.216
(man chuckling)

06:52.216 --> 06:55.393
- (sniffs) You smell that?

06:56.497 --> 06:58.710
When that sun first came up this morning,

06:58.710 --> 07:00.937
I got my first breath
of fresh air, I thought,

07:00.937 --> 07:04.163
"Goddamn! It smells like
a good day for a hanging."

07:05.360 --> 07:07.160
- You think I don't know the reason?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.620
Why you don't wanna wait a day to kill me?

07:13.619 --> 07:15.707
- Get in there and put some irons on him.

07:20.516 --> 07:23.743
(door creaking)

07:23.743 --> 07:26.326
(bell tolling)

07:29.840 --> 07:30.763
The noose is set.

07:31.770 --> 07:35.413
If you wanna try something,
a struggle of some sort,

07:36.327 --> 07:37.933
well, we won't have to use it.

07:39.592 --> 07:40.892
- I'll be waiting for you.

07:42.357 --> 07:43.774
Me and the devil.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.180
(Mabel sighs)

07:57.194 --> 08:00.777
(patriotic drumming music)

08:18.671 --> 08:22.088
(horse neighing)
- Go on!

08:24.031 --> 08:27.698
(patriotic music continues)

08:41.543 --> 08:43.086
- Gather round, folks!

08:43.086 --> 08:45.879
Time to watch a hanging!

08:45.879 --> 08:47.530
(Bob chuckles)

08:47.530 --> 08:52.530
(patriotic music continues)
(bell tolling)

09:28.505 --> 09:31.255
(paper rustling)

09:34.345 --> 09:37.428
(telegraph clicking)

09:41.346 --> 09:44.763
(tense orchestral music)

09:53.680 --> 09:54.843
Now, now, Merriweather.

09:57.046 --> 09:59.670
If anyone's going to shoot
this bastard, it'll be me.

09:59.670 --> 10:00.503
- Bob!

10:02.010 --> 10:03.860
I need you to help get that boy down.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.573
- Bob?

10:06.610 --> 10:08.010
You met The Almighty in person,

10:08.010 --> 10:10.970
you wouldn't call him by
his first name, would you?

10:10.970 --> 10:12.033
- Sheriff.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.743
I cannot conduct services
with him up there.

10:17.371 --> 10:19.530
- Don't you worry none, I'll get him down,

10:19.530 --> 10:22.030
right after this one falls
through that trap door.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.083
- Bob.

10:26.370 --> 10:27.203
Sheriff.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.483
This is the Lord's day.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.382
- Well, he can have it back in

10:37.230 --> 10:38.380
less than half an hour.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.793
- Thought we were waiting for the marshal.

10:44.367 --> 10:47.034
(birds singing)

10:49.630 --> 10:50.890
- We'll let him hang up there long enough

10:50.890 --> 10:52.640
for the marshal to get a good look.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.580
- Who in the hell is that?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.570
- His boy, I imagine.

11:01.570 --> 11:02.770
- He don't belong to me.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.520
- Well, another thief, I'm sure.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.210
- What's he doing all the way up there?

11:12.419 --> 11:13.800
- I don't suppose you climbed up there

11:13.800 --> 11:15.440
to save your friend's life?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.483
- He can't talk.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.890
Someone cut out his tongue.

11:21.298 --> 11:23.937
- (chuckling) Cut out his tongue.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.130
Well, I hope you got some other reason.

11:29.130 --> 11:30.883
Hate to see you waste your time.

11:39.210 --> 11:42.654
Deputy, care to come along?

11:42.654 --> 11:44.210
(tense orchestral music)

11:44.210 --> 11:45.247
- Get a move on.

11:46.188 --> 11:48.005
(tense orchestral music continues)

11:48.005 --> 11:51.255
(footsteps clattering)

12:08.946 --> 12:13.196
(tense orchestral music continues)

12:26.360 --> 12:27.960
- I bet you never had so many people

12:27.960 --> 12:29.760
waiting to hear what you had to say.

12:31.140 --> 12:33.350
Almost like someone cut
your tongue out, too.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.550
- [Paul] Get on with it.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.373
- Good morning, folks.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.440
I know this might seem like
an unusual time for this

12:45.660 --> 12:48.110
but there's never a bad
time to see justice done.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.623
And that is what you're about to see.

12:52.780 --> 12:55.193
This man is a horse thief.

12:56.733 --> 12:57.733
A jackal.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.593
Been scavenging on the
outskirts of our town.

13:03.507 --> 13:07.563
And like all bad men, his
bad got the best of him.

13:09.324 --> 13:12.290
Let this be a demonstration.

13:12.290 --> 13:15.903
A symbol of what happens
when evil comes around here.

13:17.045 --> 13:19.885
(Lemmy claps)

13:19.885 --> 13:22.635
(crowd clapping)

13:27.337 --> 13:29.210
- I got something to say.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.700
- You had your chance.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.593
- He has the right to a few words.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.600
- What's the expression?

13:41.600 --> 13:42.433
Wax eloquent.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.730
- What this man says here is right.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.790
I tried to own something
that didn't belong to me.

13:57.312 --> 14:01.610
But the truth is, it didn't
belong to no one else, either.

14:03.690 --> 14:05.483
You can take what was once free,

14:07.192 --> 14:08.592
and you could call it yours,

14:09.520 --> 14:13.163
but it ain't unless it wants to be.

14:16.163 --> 14:18.813
I just ask that no one hurts
themselves on my behalf.

14:20.225 --> 14:22.603
- (chuckling) If that
ain't wishful thinking.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.147
- Sheriff!

14:25.147 --> 14:27.080
Sheriff!
(tense orchestral music)

14:27.080 --> 14:27.913
Sheriff!

14:30.930 --> 14:32.532
Telegram!

14:32.532 --> 14:35.230
(tense orchestral music continues)

14:35.230 --> 14:36.230
From Marshal Graham.

14:37.470 --> 14:38.550
- Take off the noose.

14:38.550 --> 14:39.700
- It stays where it is!

14:40.580 --> 14:42.590
We might hang him in a minute.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.810
Read it.

14:43.810 --> 14:46.270
- Leaving Mammoth this morning, stop.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.170
Arriving by noon, stop.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.280
Questions for prisoner, stop.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.319
Must be alive, stop.

14:52.319 --> 14:56.569
(tense orchestral music continues)

15:04.370 --> 15:06.633
- While you're at it,
take him back to the jail.

15:08.445 --> 15:09.940
(Mabel sighs)

15:09.940 --> 15:10.773
He'll hang!

15:11.740 --> 15:13.623
By my word, he'll hang by nightfall!

15:16.119 --> 15:17.269
I'll take my breakfast.

15:18.141 --> 15:22.058
(melancholic orchestral music)

15:32.242 --> 15:33.075
- Get on.

15:37.190 --> 15:38.490
- What are you doing here?

15:39.640 --> 15:41.280
- The whole town was.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.220
- I told you it'd be best
to stay in the house.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.670
- That house doesn't own me, Jonathan.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.423
- I just want what's best for you.

15:49.870 --> 15:50.873
To keep you safe.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.490
- Or it's that you don't want your wife

15:54.490 --> 15:56.243
to see the things you take part in.

15:57.450 --> 16:01.523
- My part is the law, and I
do my best to abide by it.

16:02.910 --> 16:03.973
As we all should.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.163
- As you wish.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.490
- You talk to me less and less these days.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.560
- My father warned you I was a quiet girl.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.240
- He told me it would pass with time.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.830
- Well, I'm sorry what he
sold you was not what you

16:19.830 --> 16:21.070
bargained for.
- Mabel, what has

16:21.070 --> 16:22.127
become of you?

16:24.880 --> 16:27.993
- A woman can change just like a man.

16:29.036 --> 16:32.460
(bell tolling)
(melancholic music continues)

16:32.460 --> 16:33.900
- Even when the seasons change,

16:33.900 --> 16:35.763
they don't do so without reason.

16:37.192 --> 16:40.670
(bell tolling)
(melancholic music continues)

16:40.670 --> 16:41.553
- It will pass.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.343
Soon, there will be no reason for concern.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.273
I promise you.

16:51.027 --> 16:52.520
(bell tolling)

16:52.520 --> 16:53.660
Go on back to the house.

16:53.660 --> 16:54.760
I'll be there shortly.

16:55.690 --> 16:56.940
- I won't be coming home.

17:00.297 --> 17:01.863
There's a boy up on the church.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.290
Got to get him down somehow.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.123
- A boy?

17:07.484 --> 17:09.210
- One of the horse thief's friends.

17:09.210 --> 17:10.043
Must've climbed up

17:10.043 --> 17:11.230
this morning.
- Marcus.

17:13.470 --> 17:14.870
I hope you can get him down.

17:19.510 --> 17:20.343
Please.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.613
Take care of yourself.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.650
(footsteps clattering)

17:38.346 --> 17:40.763
(Mabel sobs)

18:35.380 --> 18:39.803
- Another second and I'd have pulled it,

18:43.160 --> 18:45.510
and you'd have dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

18:47.489 --> 18:50.890
- Damn it, Lemmy, look
what you made me done.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.660
- There ain't nothing wrong
with a little dust in it.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.815
- Quit it. Quit it!

18:56.815 --> 18:58.640
Get over here and help me pick it up.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.473
- No, thank you.

19:00.510 --> 19:02.620
- Get your skinny, little
butt on down the street

19:02.620 --> 19:03.833
and buy me another plug.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.040
Quit it, dog.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.620
- Sure.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.020
You got a couple dollars you can give me?

19:10.020 --> 19:11.780
Pay me for my time?

19:11.780 --> 19:14.060
- Don't tell me your
pockets got holes in them.

19:14.060 --> 19:17.023
Sheriff pays you as well as
he pays me, probably better.

19:20.510 --> 19:23.360
- Anyhow I might get something
to satisfy my sweet tooth.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.670
Want me to get you anything?

19:29.080 --> 19:29.980
- Something sharp.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.504
- You're going to need more than that

19:33.504 --> 19:34.740
to get your way out of here.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.810
- There's only one man I'm aiming to kill.

19:49.557 --> 19:53.167
- Get! (growls)

19:53.167 --> 19:54.334
Get out of it.

19:58.561 --> 20:02.640
(tense orchestral music)

20:02.640 --> 20:04.390
You ain't been gone long enough to.

20:05.344 --> 20:10.070
(tense orchestral music continues)

20:10.070 --> 20:12.153
- Let him out and take his chains off.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.470
- Ma'am?

20:15.470 --> 20:18.580
(tense orchestral music continues)

20:18.580 --> 20:20.033
- Set the prisoner free.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.229
- Mabel, don't do this.

20:24.229 --> 20:27.867
- [Merriweather] What the
hell are you thinking?

20:27.867 --> 20:30.023
- That I don't want to kill you.

20:32.109 --> 20:33.385
(Mabel gasps)

20:33.385 --> 20:35.221
(gunshot blasting)
(Paul gasps)

20:35.221 --> 20:36.780
(Merriweather grunts)

20:36.780 --> 20:38.110
- You shot me!

20:38.110 --> 20:39.610
- Get out of here!

20:44.762 --> 20:47.500
(Merriweather grunts)

20:47.500 --> 20:48.333
- Lemmy!

20:49.682 --> 20:50.515
Lemmy!

20:51.570 --> 20:53.490
(tense orchestral music)

20:53.490 --> 20:54.323
Lemmy!

20:58.504 --> 21:00.610
- Where are they?

21:00.610 --> 21:02.888
The keys!
- Shouldn't have done this.

21:02.888 --> 21:04.963
- Paul, where are they?

21:06.600 --> 21:07.500
- He's got them.

21:09.938 --> 21:11.917
- Lemmy!
- Mabel, no!

21:15.572 --> 21:17.155
- Give me the keys!

21:18.424 --> 21:23.424
- Shoot the!
(gunshot blasting)

21:39.792 --> 21:43.209
(tense orchestral music)

21:50.687 --> 21:52.662
- Mabel, you have to get out of here.

21:52.662 --> 21:53.880
(lock clanking)

21:53.880 --> 21:55.080
- There's no going back.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.300
They'll be coming.

21:59.275 --> 22:02.331
(Mabel pants)
(tense orchestral music)

22:02.331 --> 22:04.490
(shackles clanking)

22:04.490 --> 22:05.727
- Horses?

22:05.727 --> 22:07.894
- I didn't think that far.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.652
(Mabel gasps)

22:10.652 --> 22:12.139
Head to the corral.

22:12.139 --> 22:13.806
Are you ready?
- Yes.

22:16.390 --> 22:17.725
(gunshot popping)
(Mabel gasps)

22:17.725 --> 22:18.642
- Get down!

22:19.978 --> 22:24.188
(tense orchestral music)

22:24.188 --> 22:26.749
(gunshot popping)
(Mabel shrieks)

22:26.749 --> 22:28.453
(shutter clattering)

22:28.453 --> 22:30.910
- What damn fool's
interrupting my breakfast?

22:30.910 --> 22:32.570
- There's shooting out there.
- Sheriff, you gotta come!

22:32.570 --> 22:34.170
- The hell's going on out there?

22:35.827 --> 22:37.983
- Merriweather's lying
in the street, Sheriff.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.053
With his guts shot out.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.090
Mabel's inside the jail.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.073
- Mabel Williams?

22:44.980 --> 22:46.000
- Sheriff, I think she's-

22:46.000 --> 22:46.833
- Fetch Jonathan.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.383
- But Sheriff, I-
- Now!

22:51.250 --> 22:53.453
Every man with a gun, follow me!

22:54.844 --> 22:58.576
(tense orchestral music)

22:58.576 --> 23:00.993
(Bob grunts)

23:02.198 --> 23:04.140
- Come on, get down, son.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.530
Come on, there's no sense in this.

23:05.530 --> 23:07.120
- [Pastor] Careful!

23:07.120 --> 23:07.953
- [Lemmy] Jon.

23:08.910 --> 23:09.743
Jon!

23:09.743 --> 23:10.576
- He's busy.

23:10.576 --> 23:12.210
- Merriweather's been shot.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.730
Paul's fixing to escape.

23:13.730 --> 23:15.250
Mabel's inside the jail.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.083
- No, she's not.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.040
- I seen her myself.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.640
She's gone in the jail with him.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.140
- Go home and see that she's there.

23:22.140 --> 23:25.010
- I told you, I seen her with my own eyes.

23:25.010 --> 23:26.430
- You heard what I said.

23:26.430 --> 23:27.543
- What about the boy?

23:30.650 --> 23:33.013
- [Jonathan] He's safer up
there than anywhere else.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.520
- Goddamn, Smithey, I owe you a drink.

23:48.150 --> 23:49.220
- He's still inside?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.190
- Yeah, Smithey here's
been holding him down.

23:51.190 --> 23:53.690
- Yeah, me and two other
fellas, we got them surrounded.

23:53.690 --> 23:54.650
They'd gotten away

23:54.650 --> 23:55.700
if we hadn't-
- Hey!

23:56.558 --> 23:59.060
When are you gonna finish my shave?

23:59.060 --> 24:00.710
- Soon as it gets back to normal.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.940
- You seen any sign of my wife?

24:07.940 --> 24:09.040
- No.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.910
Heard that shotgun blast,

24:10.910 --> 24:13.800
so I came out of the shop
to see what's going on.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.590
Always bring my rifle when
I hear a shotgun blast.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.590
- [Jonathan] Sheriff, she's inside.

24:18.590 --> 24:22.693
- She's probably a hostage,
if she's still alive.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.630
We would've killed him this morning.

24:29.630 --> 24:30.880
- I will now.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.750
(gun clicking)

24:31.750 --> 24:33.360
- [Sheriff] What?

24:33.360 --> 24:35.243
- Damn, he ain't kidding.

24:38.036 --> 24:41.400
(gunshot popping)

24:41.400 --> 24:42.833
- Let her out, you hear me?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.427
She's got nothing to do with this!

24:46.427 --> 24:49.260
(gunshot popping)

24:52.970 --> 24:55.647
Mabel.
(gunshot popping)

24:55.647 --> 24:58.810
- Either that son of a bitch is a bad shot

24:58.810 --> 25:00.763
or I reckon-
- He doesn't want to kill him.

25:08.260 --> 25:09.160
- What did I miss?

25:17.690 --> 25:20.313
- Well, he can't stay in there forever.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.820
- Marshal will be here soon.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.773
- Yeah, he's due around noon.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.400
- Hey, Smithey.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.650
You ready for that drink?

25:41.530 --> 25:42.800
- Damn.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.270
Sheriff, you know I can't
hold a glass of whiskey

25:45.270 --> 25:46.723
and this rifle all at once.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.593
Hell, maybe in my younger years.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.523
- Deputy?

25:58.740 --> 25:59.630
- Not thirsty.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.090
- Well, (clears throat) if they come out,

26:05.090 --> 26:06.640
I want to be the first to know.

26:11.910 --> 26:13.197
- They?

26:13.197 --> 26:16.614
(tense orchestral music)

26:20.090 --> 26:22.090
- We use you for ransom.

26:24.621 --> 26:25.721
We'll get some horses,

26:28.330 --> 26:29.970
and we'll slip past them.

26:32.180 --> 26:33.663
They don't know why you're here.

26:34.620 --> 26:35.453
- He knows.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.320
Or he will, soon.

26:42.675 --> 26:44.842
- You don't belong to him.

26:46.140 --> 26:48.820
And our fate doesn't, to any of them.

26:50.170 --> 26:53.240
Hey, we'll find a way.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.907
(dramatic orchestral music)

27:00.700 --> 27:01.773
- Mrs. Williams.

27:04.470 --> 27:05.683
I know you ain't here.

27:08.090 --> 27:08.923
Mabel?

27:11.750 --> 27:12.883
Making supper.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.933
Dumb bastard, told you
she was in the jail.

27:17.192 --> 27:21.692
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

28:03.620 --> 28:05.590
Where's the sheriff at?

28:05.590 --> 28:07.690
- Oh, he's over there wetting his whistle.

28:09.950 --> 28:10.783
- Jonathan.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.151
Mabel wasn't at the house.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.773
- (chuckling) No, she's in the jail.

28:18.756 --> 28:20.723
- (chuckling sarcastically) Uh-huh.

28:38.380 --> 28:41.253
- Between you and me,
I never liked him much.

28:43.336 --> 28:45.380
(footsteps clattering)

28:45.380 --> 28:47.090
- Sheriff?

28:47.090 --> 28:47.923
- [Bob] What do you want?

28:47.923 --> 28:48.756
- It's me. Lemmy.

28:52.450 --> 28:53.463
- No shit.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.190
- I've been doing some thinking

29:00.060 --> 29:02.090
and I've come to thinking

29:02.090 --> 29:04.833
I know why Mabel's in there with him.

29:08.810 --> 29:09.643
- Well?

29:14.760 --> 29:16.363
- Never had no wife before,

29:18.150 --> 29:19.920
so I guess I've never had no horse thief

29:19.920 --> 29:21.263
take her captive, neither.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.163
Also, I've never used a rifle on a man.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.363
Or any other gun for that matter.

29:35.910 --> 29:37.053
Just rabbits.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.073
Lots of them.

29:43.150 --> 29:48.150
- Deputy, I'd like to bend
your ear for a moment.

29:54.840 --> 29:58.043
Jonathan, does it puzzle
you as it puzzles me

29:58.043 --> 30:00.760
that Mabel found herself inside the jail?

30:00.760 --> 30:02.360
- I plan on asking her that question

30:02.360 --> 30:04.910
after I deliver her and shoot the bastard.

30:04.910 --> 30:08.663
- See, I went in that saloon
to kinda ponder things.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.513
Sort of see things more clear-like.

30:13.670 --> 30:15.910
- Sheriff, if you have something to say

30:15.910 --> 30:18.160
I'd prefer you just say it outright.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.513
- I think you already know.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.470
It was your wife that broke in there

30:22.470 --> 30:24.430
and tried to break him out.

30:24.430 --> 30:27.470
Most likely, it was your
wife that shot my jailer.

30:27.470 --> 30:29.163
She's the cause all of this mess.

30:32.220 --> 30:36.833
Deputy, will you stand by
as nothing but a cuckold?

30:39.646 --> 30:42.229
(bell tolling)

31:13.347 --> 31:15.097
- I was wrong, Mabel.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.693
We might not leave this place.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.575
(Mabel sighs)

31:27.731 --> 31:29.481
- Whatever happens...

31:32.474 --> 31:34.254
It'll be together.

31:34.254 --> 31:39.254
(dramatic orchestral music)
(wind whirring)

32:40.800 --> 32:42.973
- Marshal Graham, I'm Lemmy.

32:47.690 --> 32:48.747
Pleased to meet you.

32:54.550 --> 32:57.160
- I assume he is still alive?

32:57.160 --> 32:59.560
- Well, yes, I wouldn't kill
him without you being here.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.570
- Well, I must speak with
him as soon as possible.

33:02.570 --> 33:04.113
- That isn't possible.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.553
At the moment.

33:09.010 --> 33:12.350
- [Graham] Oh. I see.

33:12.350 --> 33:13.183
- Never fails.

33:13.183 --> 33:15.223
I'm gone a few minutes and crap happens.

33:19.555 --> 33:21.150
- I assume he's in the jail?

33:21.150 --> 33:21.983
- With his wife.

33:23.464 --> 33:25.964
(tense music)

33:28.175 --> 33:30.870
(Graham sighs)

33:30.870 --> 33:32.603
- You've clearly laid siege.

33:34.130 --> 33:36.310
Has he tried to escape with his prisoner?

33:36.310 --> 33:38.473
- We've got riflemen on all sides.

33:42.670 --> 33:45.240
- I made sure he couldn't go anywhere.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.590
- He's trapped in there
like a fox in his hole.

33:49.530 --> 33:52.270
- There are more clever
ways to catch a fox

33:52.270 --> 33:53.420
than with one of those.

33:54.456 --> 33:56.173
- I just noticed you ain't carrying.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.893
- Never saw a need for such a thing.

34:01.979 --> 34:05.224
(suspenseful music)

34:05.224 --> 34:07.352
- What? Hey, wait!

34:07.352 --> 34:10.431
(suspenseful music continues)
(gunshot popping)

34:10.431 --> 34:12.043
(door clattering)

34:12.043 --> 34:15.876
(suspenseful music continues)

34:26.655 --> 34:27.488
- Jon!

34:27.488 --> 34:32.488
(gunshot blasting)
(Mabel shrieks)

34:34.152 --> 34:36.652
(Mabel pants)

34:38.971 --> 34:41.383
- What the hell was that?

34:41.383 --> 34:42.733
I should have you arrested.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.400
Do you hear me?
- Leave him be.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.863
Find someone to stop the
blood, or do it yourself.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.573
- Lemmy, go fetch Mrs. Wade.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.710
- A place for conversation?

35:00.190 --> 35:01.023
- This way.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.123
- You as well.

35:08.526 --> 35:11.193
(door creaking)

35:18.360 --> 35:21.471
(Paul grunts)

35:21.471 --> 35:24.054
(both panting)

35:28.320 --> 35:31.990
- Is he going to be okay? (panting)

35:35.646 --> 35:36.479
- Yeah.

35:37.339 --> 35:39.839
(Mabel pants)

36:01.060 --> 36:02.760
- I did not mean to cause all this.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.363
- No, you didn't.

36:11.285 --> 36:14.118
(bullet clinking)

36:15.435 --> 36:18.018
(Mabel sniffs)

36:23.656 --> 36:26.989
(background chattering)

36:32.231 --> 36:33.910
- You have a parlor?

36:33.910 --> 36:35.041
Private room?

36:35.041 --> 36:35.967
- Marshal.
- Marshal!

36:35.967 --> 36:37.217
- Not that comes to mind.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.190
Everyone!

36:44.190 --> 36:45.023
Leave!

36:49.916 --> 36:53.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

37:06.610 --> 37:08.943
(Bob sighs)

37:13.520 --> 37:14.870
Shouldn't she be gone, too?

37:30.780 --> 37:31.843
- Mrs. Wade?

37:33.370 --> 37:35.010
That is your name?

37:35.010 --> 37:35.843
- It is.

37:37.050 --> 37:41.803
- Mrs. Wade, you are
privy to a conversation,

37:43.010 --> 37:46.440
one that is going to mention things

37:46.440 --> 37:49.083
not to be spoken outside this room.

37:50.670 --> 37:52.640
I trust you understand?

37:52.640 --> 37:56.690
- I do.

37:56.690 --> 37:57.523
- Do you?

38:00.110 --> 38:00.943
- Yes, sir.

38:09.692 --> 38:13.080
- (chuckling) I suppose,
by now, gentlemen,

38:13.080 --> 38:17.880
it would be pointless to retrace the steps

38:20.470 --> 38:25.403
that led us to this
situation across the street.

38:26.490 --> 38:29.493
I must say, though, (chuckling)

38:31.140 --> 38:33.853
I find it compelling,

38:37.230 --> 38:41.090
almost with a touch of Shakespeare

38:41.090 --> 38:46.090
that your wife (chuckling)

38:48.570 --> 38:52.160
has become not only a prominent figure

38:52.160 --> 38:54.053
in this current action,

38:55.140 --> 39:00.140
but is, in fact, the cause
of our current trouble.

39:02.098 --> 39:05.765
(dramatic orchestral music)

39:10.470 --> 39:15.470
Sheriff, I assume you have
exhausted all strategies?

39:16.760 --> 39:20.763
- Well, we storm them out.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.383
Men in front, men behind,

39:24.561 --> 39:27.563
and we throw a torch in
there, smoke them out.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.560
They won't burn to death.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.470
They want to live, I guarantee that.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.556
When they come out, we grab them.

39:34.556 --> 39:36.606
If they come out shooting, we shoot them.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.963
Otherwise, we hang him as planned.

39:44.316 --> 39:46.580
(Graham sighs)

39:46.580 --> 39:49.563
- I take no pleasure in repeating myself.

39:53.430 --> 39:57.450
Paul does not die

39:58.780 --> 40:01.963
until I've given my word.

40:05.270 --> 40:06.770
- What use does he have alive?

40:08.153 --> 40:12.653
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

40:16.980 --> 40:21.980
- This horse thief, I
followed for some time.

40:23.090 --> 40:25.173
You might say I've been on his trail.

40:28.330 --> 40:33.330
Not too long ago, he
seized a certain animal.

40:35.050 --> 40:37.703
Not any regular animal,

40:39.730 --> 40:44.730
a prized stallion from
Belle Meade, in Tennessee.

40:47.850 --> 40:50.540
The thief apprehended the beast

40:50.540 --> 40:54.053
while it was being
transported from back east.

40:55.070 --> 40:59.740
Then, not a week ago, he
brought this stolen property

41:00.640 --> 41:02.850
to a ranch not far from here,

41:02.850 --> 41:05.293
owned by a man named Timberlake.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.800
- Please try and keep still.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.363
- This Timberlake,

41:13.620 --> 41:17.920
it is not clear if he was
an associate of Paul's

41:17.920 --> 41:20.313
or merely a pawn in his scheme.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.920
Nevertheless, he was-

41:22.920 --> 41:24.103
- Killed dead.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.630
- I see word travels fast.

41:31.630 --> 41:34.023
As you say, the rancher was murdered,

41:36.100 --> 41:39.850
perhaps by the horse thief,

41:39.850 --> 41:42.850
or it could have been by the
man who purchased the stallion.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.593
- What man? Do you have a name?

41:49.060 --> 41:51.073
- I have not been able to find it,

41:53.150 --> 41:55.683
but his tracks, and those of the horse,

41:56.550 --> 42:01.550
I'd followed a great deal, and
they are nowhere to be found.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.700
So, I must speak to Paul

42:07.140 --> 42:09.743
to learn who has taken what's been stolen,

42:10.730 --> 42:13.483
to find where they've taken it,

42:14.680 --> 42:18.650
and to return this invaluable possession

42:18.650 --> 42:20.710
to its rightful owner.

42:20.710 --> 42:21.543
- I'm finished.

42:24.860 --> 42:25.853
- As I said.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.810
Sheriff, I believe the
right course of action

42:38.810 --> 42:40.620
is to lure them out,

42:40.620 --> 42:44.050
perhaps with a promise of freedom,

42:44.050 --> 42:47.090
or else, even their courage
might get the best of them.

42:57.570 --> 42:59.120
Deputy, what are your thoughts?

43:00.190 --> 43:04.033
What might you do to get your wife back?

43:06.550 --> 43:08.303
- She's no longer my wife.

43:12.678 --> 43:13.650
(smacks table)

43:13.650 --> 43:15.290
- Goddamn.

43:15.290 --> 43:17.727
Marshal, you wait right here and see.

43:21.838 --> 43:24.588
(doors creaking)

43:39.260 --> 43:40.093
- Iago?

43:42.720 --> 43:43.830
- Lemmy.

43:43.830 --> 43:46.583
Well, Lamule is the
name my mother gave me.

43:51.480 --> 43:55.000
- Thank you, Pastor, for
making me feel so at home.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.820
I surely like it here.

43:56.820 --> 43:58.300
You are very kind.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.473
- You are very welcome.

44:01.110 --> 44:04.400
Sheriff, will you please get him down?

44:04.400 --> 44:05.330
- That's what I'm here for.

44:05.330 --> 44:06.163
- Thank you.

44:08.220 --> 44:09.600
This is Lenie Muller.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.100
She just arrived from Germany.

44:12.230 --> 44:14.284
- Welcome to America, hold my horse.

44:14.284 --> 44:16.040
(suspenseful music)

44:16.040 --> 44:18.075
- No!
(gunshot blasting)

44:18.075 --> 44:21.075
(suspenseful music)

44:43.340 --> 44:44.590
- [Bob] Hey, horse thief!

44:47.360 --> 44:48.193
Look'ee here!

44:50.472 --> 44:51.555
Got your boy!

44:58.326 --> 45:00.885
(Mabel whimpers)

45:00.885 --> 45:05.885
You were so preoccupied, I
decided to use the rope on him.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.057
- Fool's errand.

45:08.057 --> 45:11.890
(suspenseful music continues)

45:14.868 --> 45:19.370
- You come on out now, and
I just might let you live.

45:19.370 --> 45:20.743
Mrs. Williams, too.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.350
You should have seen him fly.

45:28.350 --> 45:31.009
He flew like a goddamn bird! (chuckling)

45:31.009 --> 45:33.926
(gunshot blasting)

45:42.856 --> 45:45.493
- They'll kill us now, won't they?

45:45.493 --> 45:46.326
- No.

45:50.407 --> 45:52.007
Not until he asks what he wants.

45:57.987 --> 46:00.404
Then, we just save our lives.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.803
- Should we go pick him up?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.460
- There's really no reason for it.

46:16.780 --> 46:21.403
You may want to go retrieve
that symbol of authority.

46:25.020 --> 46:25.993
It's yours now.

46:28.690 --> 46:31.430
After all, this man's too conflicted

46:35.490 --> 46:37.043
for such responsibility.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.726
(doors creaking)

47:06.105 --> 47:06.938
(gunshot popping)

47:06.938 --> 47:07.883
- [Lemmy] Oh, Jesus!

47:09.320 --> 47:11.010
- We know he's a better shot than that.

47:11.010 --> 47:11.843
- No shit.

47:19.210 --> 47:20.700
- Graham!

47:20.700 --> 47:23.323
- [Smithey] Well, this
ought to be interesting.

47:28.795 --> 47:31.545
(doors creaking)

47:45.770 --> 47:47.158
- Shoot him.

47:47.158 --> 47:49.883
- No.

47:52.410 --> 47:53.243
Mabel!

47:54.968 --> 47:55.801
Not yet.

47:57.544 --> 48:00.044
(gun cocking)

48:29.726 --> 48:32.309
(badge clinks)

48:44.346 --> 48:45.263
- Murderer.

48:46.630 --> 48:51.053
- Now, let's not waste time with insult.

48:53.550 --> 48:55.863
Anyway, I didn't kill the boy.

48:56.790 --> 48:58.040
- You might as well have,

48:59.815 --> 49:01.815
and there's no telling who will be next.

49:06.040 --> 49:08.990
- Are we going to discuss
our business affairs

49:10.990 --> 49:12.840
or is she gonna shoot me in the back?

49:14.670 --> 49:17.193
- Well, she might.

49:24.970 --> 49:25.803
- Where is it?

49:28.910 --> 49:29.743
The stallion.

49:34.270 --> 49:37.913
You are aware that I am your
only means of deliverance?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.573
- I know you'll shoot me, Graham.

49:49.750 --> 49:50.653
What about her?

49:55.230 --> 49:56.063
- The hero.

49:58.090 --> 50:01.413
Always more concerned for
the woman than himself.

50:02.707 --> 50:07.493
- Oh, we're all villains here,
Graham, of varying degrees.

50:11.010 --> 50:12.870
- She may live.

50:12.870 --> 50:14.913
I have no ill will toward her,

50:18.330 --> 50:20.250
but I can't speak for
what her husband might do.

50:20.250 --> 50:22.483
You see, he's quite upset.

50:32.220 --> 50:33.953
- I'll show you where the horse is.

50:35.010 --> 50:36.133
Give us till dark.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.073
- I see.

50:44.673 --> 50:45.913
A bittersweet farewell.

50:49.760 --> 50:50.773
Not past 12.

50:52.810 --> 50:54.017
- Oh, we'll come out.

51:02.596 --> 51:06.346
- "And we have heard
the chimes of midnight."

51:07.829 --> 51:09.253
Or we soon shall.

51:11.408 --> 51:14.491
(footsteps clomping)

51:33.779 --> 51:37.612
When the town's fast
asleep, they'll come out.

51:38.760 --> 51:39.993
- What happens then?

51:45.090 --> 51:50.090
- I think it best that
this be a private matter.

51:50.230 --> 51:51.063
- Oh.

51:52.530 --> 51:53.363
Yes, sir.

51:55.190 --> 52:00.143
I believe I have enough material
to write the first edition.

52:04.910 --> 52:08.463
- [Graham] You have
proven yourself useful.

52:10.190 --> 52:11.023
- Yes, sir.

52:12.650 --> 52:13.863
I ain't going nowhere.

52:17.770 --> 52:21.863
- Sheriff, I trust you'll stand by.

52:26.930 --> 52:27.763
- By your side.

52:31.210 --> 52:32.543
- And I am to wait.

52:35.021 --> 52:38.293
"Though waiting so be hell."

52:38.293 --> 52:41.043
(dramatic music)

52:59.213 --> 53:01.963
(customer sighs)

53:10.178 --> 53:13.761
(dramatic music continues)

53:41.399 --> 53:44.232
(hooves clomping)

53:47.515 --> 53:51.098
(dramatic music continues)

54:37.505 --> 54:40.172
(body scraping)

55:02.677 --> 55:04.888
- Would you like another, Jon?

55:04.888 --> 55:07.388
(Jonathan grunts)

55:07.388 --> 55:09.138
- I'll have one more.

55:11.307 --> 55:12.183
Did you hear me?

55:15.714 --> 55:19.232
(whiskey trickling)

55:19.232 --> 55:22.149
(glasses clinking)

55:34.960 --> 55:36.340
Where'd everyone run off?

55:36.340 --> 55:37.173
- Home.

55:38.790 --> 55:40.003
Where we all should be.

55:43.220 --> 55:44.913
- There's no home to go back to.

55:50.759 --> 55:53.509
(Jonathan sighs)

55:57.240 --> 55:59.153
You wear it on the inside,

56:02.480 --> 56:05.587
so they don't know who you
are unless you want them to.

56:16.633 --> 56:19.300
(ominous music)

56:35.435 --> 56:37.685
- I'm gonna relieve myself.

56:38.862 --> 56:40.779
- [Barman] You do that.

56:41.919 --> 56:44.752
(door clattering)

56:45.727 --> 56:49.227
(ominous music continues)

56:52.753 --> 56:55.730
- I'll check on him to make
sure he doesn't fall in.

56:55.730 --> 56:57.703
- Would it be so bad if he did?

56:59.727 --> 57:03.227
(ominous music continues)

57:06.669 --> 57:09.669
(urine splattering)

57:12.831 --> 57:14.581
- What's that letter?

57:15.644 --> 57:16.477
In your coat?

57:19.780 --> 57:21.230
- Ain't none of your concern.

57:22.623 --> 57:26.123
(ominous music continues)

57:33.902 --> 57:36.699
(both grunt)

57:36.699 --> 57:39.282
(Lemmy grunts)

57:41.765 --> 57:44.265
(Lemmy wails)

57:45.696 --> 57:48.613
(punches thumping)

57:50.048 --> 57:52.631
(Lemmy groans)

57:53.809 --> 57:57.309
(ominous music continues)

57:58.638 --> 58:01.220
(Lemmy grunts)

58:01.220 --> 58:02.808
You can't do this!

58:02.808 --> 58:05.540
(Lemmy grunts)

58:05.540 --> 58:08.963
I'm the sheriff!
(Jonathan grunts)

58:10.652 --> 58:13.652
(crickets chirping)

58:45.577 --> 58:47.762
- [Mabel] "For my husband.

58:47.762 --> 58:50.750
(thoughtful piano music)

58:50.750 --> 58:54.713
I have not been your
wife for some time now.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.743
And, perhaps I never was,

59:03.640 --> 59:05.337
in the ways that you wanted.

59:10.415 --> 59:14.370
You will remember this
Sunday, four weeks past,

59:14.370 --> 59:17.060
when the widower, Timberlake,
lost his own wife.

59:23.540 --> 59:27.207
(dramatic orchestral music)

59:28.500 --> 59:31.573
He was alone, and shouldn't be.

59:42.860 --> 59:45.143
The lie I told to myself,

59:46.030 --> 59:48.713
that you would be glad
to see me go awhile,

59:50.400 --> 59:52.323
was the turn side of the truth.

59:56.060 --> 59:57.433
I did not know it yet,

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.283
but it was I who wanted to be gone.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:06.913
To be free.

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:14.823
And that is something I
didn't know was missing,

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:17.333
until I felt it.

1:00:25.070 --> 1:00:29.483
I think a woman doesn't know
what it means to be on her own.

1:00:30.830 --> 1:00:33.170
She grows up with her mother

1:00:33.170 --> 1:00:35.473
and her father telling her, keeping her.

1:00:38.490 --> 1:00:42.693
And before she's old
enough, a man comes along.

1:00:45.173 --> 1:00:48.006
(water trickling)

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.403
She has no time.

1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:59.403
She doesn't really know if
anything is for her, because,

1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:05.897
she's never really been just her."

1:01:07.361 --> 1:01:09.444
- [Paul] Get up, come on!

1:01:10.633 --> 1:01:11.466
Get up!

1:01:13.753 --> 1:01:14.586
Get up!

1:01:16.391 --> 1:01:21.391
Go!

1:01:21.763 --> 1:01:22.596
Yah.

1:01:23.965 --> 1:01:28.465
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:40.923
- Mabel, my sister's son, Paul.

1:01:41.790 --> 1:01:42.623
- Ma'am.

1:01:43.621 --> 1:01:48.121
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:01:52.870 --> 1:01:55.070
Looks like you've never
seen a horse before.

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:02.003
- I have.

1:02:02.003 --> 1:02:06.503
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:02:14.810 --> 1:02:16.510
- Where did you get this one from?

1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:22.044
He eats like a bear but it
looks like his mama was a wolf.

1:02:22.044 --> 1:02:23.436
(Paul laughs)

1:02:23.436 --> 1:02:24.730
- Oh, trust me, when he ain't eating,

1:02:24.730 --> 1:02:27.212
he's talking too much to be either.

1:02:27.212 --> 1:02:31.326
- It's true.

1:02:31.326 --> 1:02:34.290
- Where'd you find this one?

1:02:34.290 --> 1:02:38.263
- She's been helping me
through ever since Mary passed.

1:02:40.290 --> 1:02:41.123
- Thank you.

1:02:47.460 --> 1:02:48.860
- Where are the horses from?

1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:50.953
- Many places.

1:02:52.576 --> 1:02:56.403
Why?

1:02:56.403 --> 1:02:58.463
- That white horse is beautiful.

1:03:01.060 --> 1:03:01.943
Were they wild?

1:03:03.420 --> 1:03:04.253
- Yeah.

1:03:07.450 --> 1:03:10.420
- What are you gonna do with them?

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:12.423
- He brought them here to sell, Mabel.

1:03:13.857 --> 1:03:18.357
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:21.210
- When?

1:03:21.210 --> 1:03:22.043
- Tomorrow.

1:03:31.687 --> 1:03:33.690
(Marcus clears throat)

1:03:33.690 --> 1:03:36.256
- Can I have some more peas, please?

1:03:36.256 --> 1:03:37.556
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1:03:38.783 --> 1:03:41.616
(dishes clinking)

1:03:42.453 --> 1:03:46.953
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:03:59.897 --> 1:04:01.647
- [Mabel] "I wanted to believe him,

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:05.097
but some part of me knew."

1:04:07.621 --> 1:04:12.121
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:44.406
(hooves clomping)

1:04:53.414 --> 1:04:54.497
- [Paul] Yah!

1:04:56.025 --> 1:04:56.858
Pull in.

1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:06.210
- Where'd you really find those horses?

1:05:06.210 --> 1:05:08.350
They all got brands on them.

1:05:08.350 --> 1:05:10.960
The stallion, it's not wild.

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.023
- It was, once.

1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:14.443
Just as you are, once.

1:05:19.020 --> 1:05:21.870
- I'll be headed to town
now, to fetch my husband.

1:05:21.870 --> 1:05:23.470
He'll be along shortly with the sheriff.

1:05:23.470 --> 1:05:24.553
I suggest you leave.

1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:27.790
Those horses aren't yours to sell!

1:05:27.790 --> 1:05:28.940
- Yeah, and why's that?

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:32.000
Huh?

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.150
Someone else stole them first.

1:05:34.150 --> 1:05:36.220
They were taken from their land.

1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:37.680
From their own.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:38.513
So, what does it mean

1:05:38.513 --> 1:05:41.123
that I took something that was
never theirs to begin with?

1:05:43.705 --> 1:05:45.149
(dramatic music)

1:05:45.149 --> 1:05:48.149
- Then, why don't you sit them free?

1:05:49.671 --> 1:05:51.783
- I think it's you that
wants to be set free.

1:05:55.646 --> 1:05:58.807
If you want to go, I ain't stopping you.

1:05:58.807 --> 1:06:01.453
You tell the sheriff, but I ain't leaving.

1:06:04.487 --> 1:06:06.337
- [Mabel] "I should have come to you.

1:06:07.540 --> 1:06:09.853
Part of me will never know why I didn't.

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:20.523
When I returned, a stranger had arrived.

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:27.567
He'd come for the white horse."

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:29.920
- That's my final offer.

1:06:32.740 --> 1:06:33.790
Does it not suit you?

1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:37.043
- It's not for sale.

1:06:39.193 --> 1:06:42.610
(tense orchestral music)

1:06:43.590 --> 1:06:46.290
- I've traveled a good
distance to make this purchase,

1:06:47.770 --> 1:06:51.203
and I don't intend to
leave until it's complete.

1:06:52.352 --> 1:06:54.010
(tense music continues)

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.610
- Marcus, go tend to the horses.

1:06:57.461 --> 1:06:59.890
- But I just did!
- Move, boy.

1:06:59.890 --> 1:07:00.723
Move.

1:07:01.575 --> 1:07:04.908
(tense music continues)

1:07:08.908 --> 1:07:11.575
(door clatters)

1:07:12.660 --> 1:07:14.810
- There's nothing for
purchase around here,

1:07:16.350 --> 1:07:17.260
so I think it'd be best

1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:20.086
if you hop on your horse and you get out.

1:07:20.086 --> 1:07:22.669
(Graham sighs)

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:25.130
- If there's another buyer-

1:07:25.130 --> 1:07:26.614
- There isn't.

1:07:26.614 --> 1:07:30.801
(tense orchestral music continues)

1:07:30.801 --> 1:07:34.468
Those horses are
rightfully owned by no one.

1:07:35.512 --> 1:07:38.095
(Graham sighs)

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:43.593
- By my recollection,

1:07:46.070 --> 1:07:47.800
we had an agreement.

1:07:58.870 --> 1:08:01.560
Are you aware that the authorities

1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:03.593
might want to know your whereabouts?

1:08:08.447 --> 1:08:10.403
- I'm aware of who you are,

1:08:12.490 --> 1:08:13.990
and I don't think it'd look very good

1:08:13.990 --> 1:08:16.223
for a marshal to be buying stolen horses.

1:08:19.727 --> 1:08:20.560
Would it?

1:08:28.110 --> 1:08:29.027
- Godspeed.

1:08:31.484 --> 1:08:35.151
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:09:03.670 --> 1:09:06.923
- I'm a-guessing she has
something to do with this.

1:09:11.810 --> 1:09:13.120
Wouldn't be the first time

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:16.440
you've went after something
that wasn't yours.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.543
- She's free to do what she wants.

1:09:23.108 --> 1:09:27.025
- Well, what do you want
to do with the horses?

1:09:33.702 --> 1:09:35.668
- Let them go.

1:09:35.668 --> 1:09:40.168
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:09:47.977 --> 1:09:51.980
- "And later that same
day, he honored his word.

1:09:54.667 --> 1:09:59.167
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:10:11.066 --> 1:10:14.070
As I watched them run free I felt,

1:10:14.070 --> 1:10:16.889
for the first time in my life,

1:10:16.889 --> 1:10:19.065
(hooves clomping)

1:10:19.065 --> 1:10:20.027
I was, too."

1:10:22.950 --> 1:10:24.500
Why did you change your course?

1:10:30.990 --> 1:10:33.310
- Maybe I've been going
the wrong direction

1:10:33.310 --> 1:10:34.143
for awhile now.

1:10:36.241 --> 1:10:38.841
It only took a small touch
to send me the other way.

1:10:48.210 --> 1:10:52.670
- When I was very young, I
would sneak out of my window

1:10:52.670 --> 1:10:54.823
after my father went to sleep,

1:10:57.830 --> 1:11:01.423
and I'd just wander around
in the woods for hours,

1:11:02.510 --> 1:11:07.163
not scared of the dark,
not afraid to be alone.

1:11:09.660 --> 1:11:14.660
One night, I saw this
beautiful white mare.

1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:21.823
She was moving through the
thicket and she came so close,

1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:24.170
I could almost touch her.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:33.370
The next morning, my father
put boards on the window,

1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:39.483
and not a month after that,
I saw that white mare.

1:11:42.230 --> 1:11:47.230
She was in a stable on the edge of town.

1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:52.363
She had been broken in,

1:11:55.770 --> 1:11:58.370
and she did not look at all
like she did that night,

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:02.233
but I knew it was her.

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:08.880
- You don't belong to me, Mabel.

1:12:12.379 --> 1:12:15.092
Or to any man, for that matter.

1:12:15.092 --> 1:12:19.592
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:12:33.557 --> 1:12:37.436
- "I cannot describe these horrors."

1:12:37.436 --> 1:12:39.374
Oh, my God!
- Marcus!

1:12:39.374 --> 1:12:42.162
Hey, hey, Marcus.
- Oh my!

1:12:42.162 --> 1:12:45.052
- Whoa, whoa, oh, oh, Marcus!

1:12:45.052 --> 1:12:46.781
Marcus!
(Mabel sobs)

1:12:46.781 --> 1:12:48.261
Who did this?

1:12:48.261 --> 1:12:49.544
Who did it?

1:12:49.544 --> 1:12:50.840
Marcus.

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.377
You're okay.

1:12:52.377 --> 1:12:53.827
- [Mabel] "But I can tell you

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:57.797
that I have never seen such evil."

1:12:58.937 --> 1:13:03.437
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:13:40.305 --> 1:13:42.553
(Mabel sighs)

1:13:42.553 --> 1:13:45.053
- Mabel, you need to get home.

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:46.873
- No.

1:13:49.210 --> 1:13:52.020
- I don't know what's gonna happen, okay?

1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:53.823
But I do know that if you stay here,

1:13:55.064 --> 1:13:56.113
it won't get any better.

1:13:57.615 --> 1:14:01.532
(melancholic orchestral music)

1:14:13.157 --> 1:14:15.357
- [Mabel] "A couple of
days after my return,

1:14:16.230 --> 1:14:19.450
the word around town was
they captured a horse thief

1:14:19.450 --> 1:14:21.673
upon orders from the county marshal.

1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.743
I did not know where I should be.

1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:40.063
There was no home, anymore, to go to.

1:14:45.470 --> 1:14:49.323
How many words could it take
to explain these things?

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:55.543
By the time you've read
the ones I've chosen,

1:14:56.660 --> 1:15:00.323
I may be dead, or soon will be.

1:15:04.610 --> 1:15:07.773
It was never my want to cause you pain,

1:15:10.310 --> 1:15:14.587
only to know what it means to be free."

1:15:21.790 --> 1:15:23.040
- [Paul] Get the marshal!

1:15:24.084 --> 1:15:27.180
(crickets chirping)

1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:29.593
- No need to strain your voice, Paul.

1:15:31.250 --> 1:15:32.343
I've been waiting.

1:15:36.430 --> 1:15:37.733
- If we come out now,

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.700
do I have your word

1:15:41.700 --> 1:15:44.913
that no one will shoot on me or the lady?

1:15:46.130 --> 1:15:51.023
- You have my word as
an officer of the peace.

1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.460
Put the gun down, Paul,

1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:03.078
and there'll be no more
unnecessary violence.

1:16:03.078 --> 1:16:06.078
(crickets chirping)

1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:11.223
- Only the necessary kind,
ain't that right, Marshal?

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:19.393
- Deputy.

1:16:21.050 --> 1:16:25.743
Your wife and her new man, here,

1:16:26.950 --> 1:16:28.893
have decided to turn themselves in.

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:35.083
- The boy should be given a proper burial.

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:41.130
- Put your gun down and I'll see to it

1:16:41.130 --> 1:16:43.353
that he gets what he deserves.

1:16:52.326 --> 1:16:53.976
(suspenseful music)

1:16:53.976 --> 1:16:56.846
(gunshots popping)

1:16:56.846 --> 1:16:58.436
(Graham wails)
(Mabel shrieks)

1:16:58.436 --> 1:17:00.346
(gunshots popping)
- Come on!

1:17:00.346 --> 1:17:04.179
(suspenseful music continues)

1:17:34.176 --> 1:17:36.859
I think the only way is to go around.

1:17:36.859 --> 1:17:40.692
(suspenseful music continues)

1:17:43.082 --> 1:17:45.582
(Mabel pants)

1:17:55.253 --> 1:17:56.503
- Stop.
- Don't!

1:17:59.353 --> 1:18:01.313
- You're not gonna stop us.

1:18:06.710 --> 1:18:07.543
- Mabel.

1:18:11.380 --> 1:18:12.213
You're free.

1:18:15.238 --> 1:18:17.946
(gunshot popping)

1:18:17.946 --> 1:18:20.446
(Mabel wails)

1:18:23.630 --> 1:18:25.840
- I told you he doesn't die!

1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:27.483
- I wasn't aiming for him.

1:18:28.577 --> 1:18:30.994
(Mabel sobs)

1:18:36.559 --> 1:18:38.770
(gunshot popping)

1:18:38.770 --> 1:18:40.340
- You've ruined everything.

1:18:41.177 --> 1:18:43.594
(Mabel sobs)

1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.750
He was the only one that knew.

1:18:46.750 --> 1:18:48.363
- She knows.

1:18:49.410 --> 1:18:53.296
She was there.
(Mabel sobs)

1:18:53.296 --> 1:18:54.519
(rifle thudding)

1:18:54.519 --> 1:18:57.389
(Mabel sobs)

1:18:57.389 --> 1:19:00.389
(crickets chirping)

1:19:07.036 --> 1:19:10.960
You thought you got the
best of Lemmy, didn't you?

1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:14.320
Always treating me like
you're better than me.

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:15.153
- Coward.

1:19:21.690 --> 1:19:22.523
- That'll do.

1:19:26.670 --> 1:19:28.503
We have some business to attend to.

1:19:31.380 --> 1:19:32.713
- What now, Graham?

1:19:33.890 --> 1:19:35.083
He's dead.

1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:39.950
- There's no doubt in your mind

1:19:39.950 --> 1:19:43.773
that she knows where my stallion is?

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:50.623
- I wouldn't be surprised
if he knows, too.

1:19:54.620 --> 1:19:57.323
She probably told him in that letter.

1:19:58.950 --> 1:20:01.093
- You read that letter.
- Quiet!

1:20:04.910 --> 1:20:09.910
Mabel, I've got some plans
for you, too, darling.

1:20:12.124 --> 1:20:14.707
(key clinking)

1:20:15.780 --> 1:20:17.480
- This correspondence...

1:20:19.470 --> 1:20:20.303
Where is it?

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:30.113
- May I?

1:20:45.100 --> 1:20:48.163
What do you think's going to
happen to her when you're gone?

1:20:49.774 --> 1:20:52.192
(slap smacking)
(Mabel wails)

1:20:52.192 --> 1:20:54.859
(door creaking)

1:21:00.210 --> 1:21:03.903
- I told you it was a bad
idea to bring her here.

1:21:11.830 --> 1:21:15.710
- I think Mrs. Wade knows, now,

1:21:15.710 --> 1:21:17.700
the meaning of discretion,

1:21:21.970 --> 1:21:26.970
and there will be much
bloodshed in the time coming up.

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:38.343
We need you, Deputy,

1:21:39.300 --> 1:21:43.550
and your estranged wife to live,

1:21:50.860 --> 1:21:55.860
so that you can give me back
what is rightfully mine.

1:21:56.250 --> 1:21:58.150
- You don't know what's right anymore.

1:21:59.291 --> 1:22:00.173
You never did.

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:07.380
- Marshal, I brought some
food for the woman, may I?

1:22:11.510 --> 1:22:12.683
- In a short while.

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:16.553
And she may not have a tongue to taste.

1:22:21.030 --> 1:22:21.863
Smithey?

1:22:23.820 --> 1:22:25.480
- [Smithey] Yes, Marshal?

1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:29.190
- You are a barber, if
I remember correctly?

1:22:29.190 --> 1:22:30.240
- [Smithey] Yes, sir.

1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:34.913
- Would you happen to
have your straight razor?

1:22:40.322 --> 1:22:42.260
Could I borrow it?

1:22:42.260 --> 1:22:46.050
- Marshal, with all due respect,

1:22:46.050 --> 1:22:47.893
this ain't what I bargained for.

1:22:49.502 --> 1:22:51.880
I'd just soon take my rifle

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:54.080
and leave you all alone
to your own affairs.

1:22:55.844 --> 1:22:57.883
- (exhales) Why, of course.

1:23:02.740 --> 1:23:03.573
Sheriff?

1:23:05.390 --> 1:23:09.383
Can you think of any reason
why he shouldn't take leave?

1:23:15.130 --> 1:23:16.033
- Not at all.

1:23:18.416 --> 1:23:20.666
Smithey, have a good night.

1:23:30.205 --> 1:23:32.823
(crickets chirping)
(gunshot popping)

1:23:32.823 --> 1:23:35.823
(suspenseful music)

1:23:36.665 --> 1:23:41.665
- Now, I trust that we shall
have no more interruptions.

1:23:43.089 --> 1:23:46.922
(suspenseful music continues)

1:23:49.109 --> 1:23:52.192
(footsteps clomping)

1:23:57.590 --> 1:24:02.590
Sheriff, would you be so kind

1:24:03.210 --> 1:24:05.123
as to hold the prisoner's head for me?

1:24:08.210 --> 1:24:09.043
- Gladly.

1:24:13.135 --> 1:24:15.968
(Jonathan grunts)

1:24:19.722 --> 1:24:22.420
(Mabel pants)

1:24:22.420 --> 1:24:23.253
- Please!

1:24:24.290 --> 1:24:25.453
Stop.

1:24:30.670 --> 1:24:32.710
I'll tell you what you want to know.

1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:38.440
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

1:24:41.998 --> 1:24:44.581
(Graham sighs)

1:24:54.530 --> 1:24:55.630
- Where's my stallion?

1:24:58.420 --> 1:24:59.253
- Paul...

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:05.603
He set it free.

1:25:09.170 --> 1:25:10.453
- Noble gesture.

1:25:12.930 --> 1:25:14.863
And a lie.

1:25:17.790 --> 1:25:21.793
I've never seen a thief so generous.

1:25:31.298 --> 1:25:34.381
(footsteps clomping)

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.923
Perhaps you'll tell me the truth.

1:25:47.872 --> 1:25:48.705
- Jon.

1:25:49.857 --> 1:25:51.783
- You wouldn't recognize the truth.

1:25:55.300 --> 1:25:56.133
- Try me.

1:26:04.037 --> 1:26:07.204
- "If they prick us, do we not bleed?"

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.083
- We have similar tastes.

1:26:12.050 --> 1:26:12.883
Shame.

1:26:14.290 --> 1:26:16.353
Soon, you won't have any taste.

1:26:20.877 --> 1:26:22.856
- [Jonathan] "If they tickle us."

1:26:22.856 --> 1:26:24.603
- Mabel, please.

1:26:26.897 --> 1:26:28.363
- "Do we not laugh?

1:26:33.110 --> 1:26:38.110
If they poison us, do we not die?

1:26:42.950 --> 1:26:45.566
And if they wrong us."

1:26:45.566 --> 1:26:48.395
- "Shall we not revenge?"

1:26:48.395 --> 1:26:51.713
(gun cocking)
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:26:51.713 --> 1:26:54.546
(gunshot popping)

1:27:00.510 --> 1:27:01.582
- Are you all right?

1:27:01.582 --> 1:27:02.415
- Yes.

1:27:04.090 --> 1:27:05.960
- Oh, I wish I could've done more.

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:06.793
- Thank you.

1:27:08.850 --> 1:27:10.603
- He may come back again.

1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:14.178
- Mabel, you have to leave now.

1:27:14.178 --> 1:27:16.760
(tense orchestral music)

1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:17.720
- Wake the town.

1:27:22.075 --> 1:27:27.075
(bell tolling)
(tense orchestral music)

1:28:12.175 --> 1:28:13.306
(Smithey grunts)

1:28:13.306 --> 1:28:16.056
(gunshot blasts)

1:28:18.576 --> 1:28:22.826
(tense orchestral music continues)

1:28:29.411 --> 1:28:31.994
(Graham pants)

1:28:34.743 --> 1:28:39.743
- "And Caesar's spirit,
raging with revenge."

1:28:47.125 --> 1:28:49.628
- Do you have someplace you can go?

1:28:49.628 --> 1:28:51.170
(Mabel sighs)

1:28:51.170 --> 1:28:52.003
- The ranch.

1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:54.263
I feel safe there.

1:28:57.250 --> 1:28:58.500
What are you going to do?

1:29:01.010 --> 1:29:02.910
- Make sure Graham doesn't follow you.

1:29:05.980 --> 1:29:07.030
- Jonathan.
- Mabel.

1:29:10.412 --> 1:29:11.523
I meant what I said.

1:29:13.670 --> 1:29:14.503
You're free.

1:29:18.062 --> 1:29:18.895
- Yah!

1:29:21.691 --> 1:29:23.142
Yah.

1:29:23.142 --> 1:29:28.142
(dramatic orchestral music)
(hooves clomping)

1:29:41.823 --> 1:29:45.240
(tense orchestral music)

1:29:46.671 --> 1:29:48.671
- "With Ate by his side,

1:29:51.773 --> 1:29:53.417
come straight from hell."

1:29:55.890 --> 1:30:00.890
- Marshal Graham, you're under arrest.

1:30:03.387 --> 1:30:07.940
- "Shall in these confines
and with a monarch's voice

1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:11.947
cry 'Havoc!' and let
slip the dogs of war!"

1:30:11.947 --> 1:30:14.780
(gunshot popping)

1:30:16.902 --> 1:30:18.763
(Graham coughs)

1:30:18.763 --> 1:30:21.596
(Graham sputters)

1:30:23.079 --> 1:30:26.746
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:30:30.366 --> 1:30:33.533
(footsteps crunching)

1:30:46.771 --> 1:30:47.604
- Deputy.

1:31:07.513 --> 1:31:10.013
(Mabel sighs)

1:31:14.670 --> 1:31:15.523
- Come with me.

1:31:20.332 --> 1:31:23.999
(dramatic orchestral music)
