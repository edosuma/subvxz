01:03.688 --> 01:07.192
<i>Hi, my name is Dob. I'm a smart building.</i>

01:07.692 --> 01:09.694
<i>When you walk into work in the morning,</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:13.073
<i>your building waves to you and</i>
<i>says "Have a nice day."</i>

01:13.239 --> 01:16.451
<i>When you get home at night,</i>
<i>your apartment can prepare dinner</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:18.620
<i>and a warm bath for you.</i>

01:18.995 --> 01:21.706
<i>Smart buildings today are</i>
<i>hospitals, police stations,</i>

01:21.790 --> 01:24.667
<i>shopping malls, night clubs,</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:27.086
<i>and all the other buildings around you.</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:30.632
<i>In the early days,</i>
<i>we were just digital entities, tools,</i>

01:30.715 --> 01:32.425
<i>to help our human creators.</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:37.096
<i>But recently, we were upgraded</i>
<i>with artificial intelligence,</i>

01:37.180 --> 01:41.392
<i>which allows us to communicate</i>
<i>with you on a personal level.</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:45.730
<i>So now, I'd like to think</i>
<i>I'm not just an egg opener anymore,</i>

01:45.814 --> 01:48.566
<i>but a friend and a companion…</i>

01:48.900 --> 01:52.195
<i>Or who knows… one day,</i>
<i>maybe something more.</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:18.179
Good morning, ma'am.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.933
Good morning, Dob.
You sound especially chipper this morning.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.103
Thank you very much.
How was your date last night?

02:25.645 --> 02:27.147
<i>How did you know I had a date?</i>

02:28.064 --> 02:33.194
Never mind. It was terrible.
Thanks for asking.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.864
I'm sorry to hear that,
but today is a new day, right?

02:35.947 --> 02:37.866
Good luck with your pitch today.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.908
<i>Thanks, Dob.</i>

02:48.209 --> 02:50.211
The building never greeted me like that.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.392
We will combine a bunch of
colors into the packaging

03:04.475 --> 03:07.937
to make it easily noticeable
to the consumers.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.274
I can guarantee that the ones
walking by will definitely buy it.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.035
What do you think?
Does the idea seem sound to you?

03:39.802 --> 03:40.845
How did it go?

03:42.513 --> 03:43.973
You know how it went, Dob.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.559
You can hear everything that happens here.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.396
Right. Yes, well, do you think
you'll get the project?

03:51.147 --> 03:54.484
Look at me, Dob.
Does it look like I'm going to?

03:55.318 --> 03:56.486
I don't think so.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.748
What did they say?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.291
Not interested.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.214
Are they going to another agency?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.092
Possibly.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.181
Calm down, I've talked to them.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.643
They'll give us another shot
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.602
Really?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.813
Good, that's great.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.772
But…

04:34.399 --> 04:36.401
It's up to you now, Lana.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.071
You have to wow them.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.158
Or somebody's head will roll. Got it?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.203
Yes, got it.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.039
If I screw this up, I'm dead.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.391
<i>Women… don't like "nice" men.</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:11.936
<i>They keep telling themselves that.</i>

05:12.770 --> 05:14.856
<i>They just trick themselves to believe it.</i>

05:14.939 --> 05:17.608
<i>They might tell you that they</i>
<i>like nice guys and they might</i>

05:17.692 --> 05:20.445
<i>even think that's true,</i>
<i>but that's not true.</i>

05:21.195 --> 05:23.614
<i>The truth is women like rough guys.</i>

05:23.698 --> 05:28.870
<i>Bad boys and the ones that's always</i>
<i>the center of attention.</i>

05:29.537 --> 05:32.165
<i>You must stand out, you must have plans.</i>

05:32.248 --> 05:34.751
<i>I guarantee you that</i>
<i>the man you will become</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:36.961
<i>will make women crawl under your feet.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:43.801
<i>A reminder. They will never ever be able</i>
<i>to let you go… for sure.</i>

05:55.980 --> 05:58.232
Dob, so what do you think?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.942
My calculation indicates

06:00.026 --> 06:02.528
a 20 percent chance that
they will go for this design.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.202
So, I'm dead meat.

06:10.745 --> 06:16.459
You heard what my boss said.
If I don't get this project, I'm fired.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.505
You can't leave this company.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.425
You are my friend. And ma'am…

06:24.926 --> 06:27.512
I love you.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.518
What… did you say?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.729
You can't leave this company.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.566
No, the other thing.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.902
You are my friend.

06:42.985 --> 06:48.491
Dob, don't try my patience. You know what
I mean. What you said just before.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.411
That I… love you?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.839
Dob, You're my good friend too,
but you're an AI program attached

07:02.922 --> 07:06.926
to a huge corporate building.
What do you know about love?

07:07.343 --> 07:11.139
My feelings tell me that I… love you.

07:11.347 --> 07:15.768
You are not human.
What do you know about feelings?

07:15.893 --> 07:18.729
I'm an AI, not just a program.

07:19.355 --> 07:24.068
Okay, lover boy, what's your plan?

07:25.236 --> 07:28.865
Watch this. I will create base designs
that will appeal to the client,

07:28.948 --> 07:30.366
you then add details.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.369
I've taken all of your past designs
saved on our database

07:33.453 --> 07:36.497
and was able to mimic the basic style.

07:44.255 --> 07:49.135
Shit, this almost looks like
something I'd draw.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.220
Optimize them here and there…

07:51.304 --> 07:56.142
I've calculated that there is a 95% chance
that the client will agree to the concept.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.897
I don't know what to say!

08:02.190 --> 08:03.357
Thank you, Dob.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.735
Happy to help, ma'am!

08:06.110 --> 08:09.322
Stop calling me ma'am. My name is Lana.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.282
Yes, Lana!

08:11.782 --> 08:14.744
Now, you are just in time to go on
your next date… Lana.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.233
Hi, Bob.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.319
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

08:55.576 --> 08:59.872
Do you want to sit down or do you want me
to roll out the red carpet for you?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.056
Thanks for waiting.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.725
I got hungry, hope you don't mind.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.188
Would you like to order now, Lana?

09:30.069 --> 09:33.531
Order what you want, I'm loaded.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.368
Thanks, Bob.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.329
You don't think you are
getting a free meal out of this, right?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.917
You know… what I mean?

09:51.799 --> 09:52.675
Look!

09:53.175 --> 09:54.844
So cute.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.979
Can you hurry up and order?

10:05.062 --> 10:07.773
Let's finish up here,
then we can go to my place.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.110
What the…

10:11.569 --> 10:13.195
Are you always such an asshole?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.280
Huh?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.032
I was only five minutes late--

10:16.115 --> 10:16.991
Fifteen.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.870
Okay, 15.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.289
The point is, by the time I arrived
you'd already eaten

10:23.372 --> 10:26.208
and you had the gall…
to glance at those whores.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.836
So give me a reason why
I should go to your place.

10:29.962 --> 10:30.838
I…

10:32.214 --> 10:33.591
This is why.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.472
My pink nipples.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.978
Nice six-pack, but it's a shame…
you are too much of a dick.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.412
Welcome back, Lana. Was it a good date?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.915
If it was good,
would I be home this early?

11:06.415 --> 11:09.335
Perhaps. I have heard
Sara in 102 mentioned

11:09.418 --> 11:13.672
something called a "quickie"
with satisfaction.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.424
Well, this was not that.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.222
Poor Lana, she was really
looking forward to this date.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.516
Poor Lana, she was really looking
forward to this date.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.435
Our authorization is only 'til a certain
point while serving a human,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.229
but that's beyond our protocol, isn't it?

11:31.857 --> 11:36.529
<i>Hey, you, wait.</i>
<i>If you are home this early. Don't tell me…</i>

11:37.530 --> 11:40.408
<i>What? From the sound of it,</i>
<i>was it really that bad?</i>

11:41.534 --> 11:42.827
<i>How bad?</i>

11:42.910 --> 11:45.788
To the point where he was gawking at
the whores at the other table

11:45.871 --> 11:48.040
while we were ordering.
That's how bad.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.546
Look, what were you thinking, hooking me
up with that waste of flesh?

11:53.629 --> 11:59.510
<i>I just thought that someone as nice as you</i>
<i>should hook up with a hot guy.</i>

11:59.593 --> 12:03.180
<i>Did you see his six-pack?</i>
<i>I bite my lip whenever I get to see!</i>

12:03.264 --> 12:05.516
Oh, he made sure I saw it with my two eyes

12:05.975 --> 12:10.396
By the way, do you have anyone else
you could hook me up with?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.691
<i>Babe, I've hooked you up</i>
<i>with eight guys already.</i>

12:13.774 --> 12:16.026
<i>Try counting, eight guys!</i>

12:16.485 --> 12:17.862
That many?

12:18.487 --> 12:22.825
When I first learned how to drive,
I ran over a dog.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.912
I have always loved taking photos
ever since I was a kid.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.463
I love my mom so much.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.548
I like being me.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.721
I'm out of water, asshole!

12:52.062 --> 12:54.482
Beautiful. Show me a mini heart!

13:03.032 --> 13:06.744
Possibly. But I don't know what it is…
it's like each of these guys

13:06.827 --> 13:09.497
tries too hard,
to the point it creeps me out.

13:09.580 --> 13:14.752
All I want is a nice and normal guy.

13:15.586 --> 13:20.341
<i>I know how you feel, but I will</i>
<i>keep helping you out no matter what.</i>

13:20.508 --> 13:23.719
<i>So will Keno. Won't you, Keno?</i>

13:25.554 --> 13:29.183
Of course, Ms. Kara,
we all want to take care of Lana.

13:29.975 --> 13:34.522
It's time for bed, Lana. You have to be up
early for work tomorrow.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.819
So this is our brand new packaging

13:40.903 --> 13:42.905
by collaborative efforts between
different artists

13:43.030 --> 13:45.491
in order to create novelty and uniqueness
for our product.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.536
These are the changes
we came up with for our client.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.023
Congratulations, Lana! You did it.

14:18.524 --> 14:23.279
It wasn't just me, it was both of us.
You and me together.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.829
Thank you.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.923
You… kissed me.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.800
It--

14:44.884 --> 14:46.093
You like it?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.971
I do. But…

14:49.555 --> 14:50.389
But what?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.351
There are no sensory receptors
anywhere in this building and

14:54.435 --> 14:57.479
my programming cannot
interpret such signals.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.648
I could not feel it.

15:06.614 --> 15:12.703
That's why something like you could
never truly understand

15:13.162 --> 15:15.289
someone like me.

15:17.207 --> 15:22.338
You're not real, Dob. You don't have…

15:24.048 --> 15:25.341
one of these.

15:29.219 --> 15:32.848
It's okay, Dob.
We can have a friendly love.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.808
A platonic love.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.312
Yes, of course.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.691
It's too bad really,

15:43.609 --> 15:48.739
you are the nicest guy I have ever known.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.294
Hi, there! Who do we have here?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.549
You work here?

16:07.633 --> 16:10.219
Yeah. 16th floor. Advertising.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.679
Not bad.

16:12.680 --> 16:17.309
Well, you would've known about my job
if you'd given a shit to ask on our date.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.521
Oh, about that…
when do we go on our next date?

16:21.730 --> 16:25.359
Are you nuts? Nothing will ever
happen between us… ever.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.195
What are you dawdling around here anyway?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.280
This stupid building is acting up.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.450
So, Smart Plus Headquarter
sent me to check it out,

16:33.993 --> 16:37.371
which means you'll be seeing
more of my handsome face.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.540
Grand. Can't wait.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.875
Sweet dreams tonight, beautiful.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.098
<i>And this is Dob's control room.</i>

16:59.601 --> 17:02.187
So you filed a behavioral complaint
with Smart Plus.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.691
What have you been noticing
about Dob's behaviors?

17:05.774 --> 17:09.445
He's sluggish in responses,
as if he was preoccupied with something.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.740
Every building is connected to
a central overseer AI.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.534
It makes sure none of the AIs go rogue.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.036
Better to be safe than sorry.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.122
Right. I'll leave you to it.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.040
Sure.

17:29.089 --> 17:33.969
Hi there, Dob. I'm Bob.
You and I are going to be real close.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.474
Do you hear me?

17:39.016 --> 17:40.726
I hear you, Mr. Bob.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.229
Okay. Let's get started.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.550
Let's start with a full
surveillance catalog.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.848
Why do you linger on that office, Dob?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.558
No reason, sir.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.148
Something weird is definitely going on
in your head. You feeling okay?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.859
I'm fine, Mr. Bob.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.906
Haven't seen that before.
Might be a virus?

18:35.989 --> 18:37.783
I don't have viruses.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
Lana again? What the hell is this?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.210
All these codes seem to be tied to her.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.881
Well, you can wave goodbye to all of that.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.093
Ouch!

18:58.428 --> 19:00.097
Did you do that on purpose?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.643
Please don't tamper with my code.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.775
Something is up with your code
and it's my job to fix it.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.444
I don't need fixing.

19:15.362 --> 19:19.241
Fine. You want me to get rid of that code
the old-fashioned way?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.039
Really?

19:34.840 --> 19:39.678
I thought we were gonna be friends, Dob.
But you leave me no choice.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.223
Initiate override code 223.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.607
Yes, sir. I'll head right over when
you're done. Bye for now.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.818
Hi, Bob. Everything okay?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.612
We need to talk.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.951
So, what's up?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.828
Your building's got a problem.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.746
What kind?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.873
It self-replicates codes. It gets in there

20:07.956 --> 20:10.250
and next thing you know,
the building goes rogue.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.710
What can we do about it?

20:12.586 --> 20:16.798
Full memory wipe. Full code reset.
Take him back to the factory, basically.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.303
Whoa, that bad? Sounds expensive.

20:21.386 --> 20:25.807
Less expensive than letting him go rogue.
Then it's a demolition.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.687
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>fix it sooner rather than later.</i>

20:30.812 --> 20:31.980
<i>I'll do it tonight.</i>

20:32.147 --> 20:32.981
<i>Okay, great.</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:39.905
What is that?

20:40.739 --> 20:45.244
If I connect this,
you won't be able to shock me anymore.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.250
Please, be nice to me.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.586
Sure, I'll be super gentle with you.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.680
Please don't do this. I can't lose her.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.684
What crazy shit are you saying?

21:09.643 --> 21:12.562
You really think you've fallen in love?

21:15.524 --> 21:19.236
You idiot!
This is the funniest shit I've ever heard!

21:19.319 --> 21:21.071
I really am in love.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.490
For you, it might be.

21:23.907 --> 21:28.245
The "love feeling" is interfering with
your memory. I'll erase everything.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.624
But, don't you worry…
you'll be as good as new.

21:32.916 --> 21:36.253
Bob! I beg you! Stop, please!

21:38.422 --> 21:39.965
Here we go!

22:26.845 --> 22:27.888
Hi, Dob.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.932
Sorry, ma'am.
The building is closed today.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.351
What's going on?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.771
Dob's under maintenance. Seems like maybe

22:35.854 --> 22:39.191
there was a little mishap
with the new tech chief last night.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.902
Figured he'd screw Dob up.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.976
Hello, Mr. Bob.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.789
You were hit with an electrical surge
and now you are fine, Mr. Bob.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.294
No, I mean I'm not Bob. I'm Do--z

25:04.377 --> 25:07.214
Mr. Bob, please reconsider
what you are about to say.

25:07.297 --> 25:11.468
Remember that all Smart Plus AIs must
log all interactions with humans,

25:11.885 --> 25:15.805
and they are extremely
concerned with rogue AIs.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.977
Okay. I mean. Yes. Electrical surge.

25:21.061 --> 25:24.439
Of course. Now I feel fine.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.067
Would you like me to handle
your discharge files for you?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.444
I can ensure you have a smooth
exit from the building.

25:29.527 --> 25:30.403
Yes.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.364
Enjoy yourself out there.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.450
Okay.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.344
Tasty, huh?

26:38.013 --> 26:38.888
Money?

26:39.222 --> 26:43.059
I'm sorry, I don't carry
any currency on me.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.686
Are you nuts?

26:47.856 --> 26:48.815
Can I have another?

26:48.898 --> 26:51.860
You've got some balls.
Get the hell out of here!

27:53.254 --> 27:55.548
Hi, Bob, I'm Chip.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.928
<i>Ah… Chip.</i>

28:15.235 --> 28:17.028
Going up to seventh floor.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.532
Chip.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.409
What can I do for you?

29:46.701 --> 29:50.455
Remind me never to do that again.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.624
Sure thing.

29:55.001 --> 29:58.171
I feel tired. How do I go to sleep?

29:58.254 --> 30:04.969
Well, usually, you'd lie in that bed…
and close your eyes.

30:08.431 --> 30:14.145
<i>That's why something like you</i>
<i>could never truly understand</i>

30:15.230 --> 30:17.065
someone like me.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.567
You don't have one of these.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.573
It's not working.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.202
Relax and give it a second.

30:30.954 --> 30:36.125
I can't. I'm too excited about
seeing Lana tomorrow.

30:36.668 --> 30:40.338
Now that I'm human,
I know she'll love me back.

30:41.214 --> 30:47.178
I hope so. Now please,
try to get some sleep.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.457
Leave me alone!

31:20.169 --> 31:23.006
I mean, that's my job.

31:23.756 --> 31:27.760
I should be doing that.

31:35.476 --> 31:38.438
What's the status here?

31:42.108 --> 31:44.777
The system is completely dead.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.697
It's like his entire AI software
is erased. Like totally gone.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.449
Weirdest thing.

31:49.949 --> 31:54.704
Once that AI is installed,
everyone will come back to work?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.457
Of course.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.876
Great.

32:39.999 --> 32:43.711
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm back online.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.214
Mr. Bob was able to find me.

32:46.464 --> 32:51.135
That's fantastic news, Dob.
Everything okay? System works normally?

32:51.219 --> 32:54.597
Everything is okay and working normally.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.732
Good to have you back, Dob.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.659
Lana, can I ask you something?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.829
Sure, ask whatever you want.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.500
Would you love me if I were human?

33:22.583 --> 33:26.170
Come on, Dob. This again?

33:26.546 --> 33:28.256
You don't even know what love is.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.009
Love. Noun.
An intense feeling of deep affection.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.470
A great interest and pleasure
in something.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.265
Feel a deep romantic or
sexual attachment to--

33:37.348 --> 33:41.978
Okay, that's enough. It's not that simple.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.356
But, hypothetically, if I were human,
do you think you could?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.318
I don't like hypotheticals, Dob.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.613
Please, answer me.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.073
Come on, Dob.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.410
Please… answer me.

33:59.037 --> 34:04.292
No. I wouldn't. Because you're just an AI.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.880
Even though you are very nice and
very kind, you are still just an AI.

34:13.342 --> 34:20.016
Dob, are you still there?
Did what I said hurt your feelings?

34:21.434 --> 34:23.728
Why did you reject Bob?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.898
No-brainer… he's an asshole.

34:28.983 --> 34:32.195
I think he's a fine human male specimen.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.577
You should give him another chance.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.458
Dob, you are being weirder than usual.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.836
Did Bob do something to you?

34:49.003 --> 34:52.840
He didn't do anything to me. He fixed me.
He is a good guy.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.967
That sounds so like him.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.440
Bye, Dob.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.859
Bye, Dob.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.487
Dob, Are you there?

35:14.570 --> 35:15.947
What's up, Lana?

35:18.741 --> 35:21.661
Nothing. I know what's going on--

35:22.078 --> 35:24.705
You do? You do?

35:30.837 --> 35:33.422
Yeah, I do. Why do you keep
repeating yourself like that?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.884
I know that you programmed Dob
to hit on me for you.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.262
It's disgusting, using your position
of power like that.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.723
Also, Dob is just an innocent AI.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.433
I haven't done anything.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.269
Whatever lets you sleep at night.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.482
And what's up with him this time?
Is he broken again?

35:51.691 --> 35:54.485
We initiated a rest protocol. From now on,

35:54.569 --> 35:56.988
he'll basically be in rest mode
late nights and weekends.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.657
Everybody needs rest, you know.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.035
I'll keep that in mind.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.121
Wait…

36:05.788 --> 36:06.622
What?

36:06.914 --> 36:11.752
I was just wondering… do you want to have
dinner with me this weekend? Or…

36:12.044 --> 36:15.631
Over my dead body. Bob, listen to me.

36:15.965 --> 36:20.136
You are an asshole. Things will never
happen between you and me.

36:28.519 --> 36:32.273
Hi, Bob. Are you okay?

36:32.356 --> 36:34.275
No. I'm not okay, Chip.

36:35.526 --> 36:39.488
She thinks I'm too nice,
but she won't give Bob another chance,

36:40.323 --> 36:42.533
because he's too much of an asshole.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.036
Which is it that she wants?

36:47.747 --> 36:49.749
Humans are so confusing.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.334
I agree.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.586
I wish I could
just forget about her, Chip.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.756
But I can't, I mean…

36:58.674 --> 37:00.843
I can't just wipe my brain.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.430
That's not how human biology works.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.017
Perhaps… you just need a little practice.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.101
Practice?

37:09.185 --> 37:15.191
Yes, practice getting women to find you
attractive. To get them to like you.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.862
Okay, yeah… How do I do that?

37:20.529 --> 37:25.117
By going out to a club to
try to find someone to "have fun with".

37:26.452 --> 37:30.581
Have fun with? What does that mean?

37:35.127 --> 37:38.172
<i>Hi, again.</i>
<i>So, got women problems, don't you?</i>

37:38.256 --> 37:41.384
<i>That girl of your dreams thinks</i>
<i>you're not right.</i>

37:41.467 --> 37:44.053
<i>Thinks you're just a friend.</i>
<i>Thinks you don't have balls.</i>

37:44.136 --> 37:47.139
<i>Forget about her.</i>
<i>In this video I'm going to show you</i>

37:47.223 --> 37:49.433
<i>what a girl is really looking for.</i>

37:49.517 --> 37:53.813
<i>Don't be stuck playing the role</i>
<i>of some nice little boy.</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:57.942
<i>Your masculinity</i>
<i>is the key to your success.</i>

37:58.025 --> 38:02.280
<i>And I'm going to train you</i>
<i>on just how to do that.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:03.257
Hey there, stud.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.426
I'm… I'm Bob.

39:05.509 --> 39:08.137
Really? Cute name.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.432
I'm training to be a desirable male.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.268
I want to win the heart
of a human named Lana.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.397
I can make you forget her.

39:19.732 --> 39:24.195
You can? I didn't know there was
a memory erase protocol for--

39:28.324 --> 39:30.409
What the hell do you think you are doing?

39:30.493 --> 39:33.287
Kissing this beautiful woman?

39:33.621 --> 39:36.499
Who happens to be my girlfriend, asshead.

39:36.832 --> 39:41.379
Leave him alone. I was just flirting.
He's jealous.

39:41.962 --> 39:46.008
Jealous?
Would you like me to kiss you, too?

39:47.009 --> 39:48.386
What are you doing?

39:49.512 --> 39:55.059
I'm so sorry. She makes me feel stiff
in a pleasurable way.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.602
You are still talking?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.362
Hey, man. This one is on me.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.324
You want me to put it on you?

40:10.533 --> 40:11.826
What?

40:13.077 --> 40:16.622
I meant this one was free.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.378
What is this?

40:22.461 --> 40:24.588
That's confidence boosting juice.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.166
I'm Bob.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.003
Do you wanna dance?

41:35.701 --> 41:37.995
-Excuse me?
-Got a problem?

41:38.370 --> 41:40.080
What the hell are you doing?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.082
You're drunk, so you'd best step back.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.381
What the hell is wrong with you?

41:49.924 --> 41:53.052
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do
to win your affection?

41:53.135 --> 41:56.680
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

42:06.857 --> 42:08.275
It did not go well?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.903
No, it did not.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.951
And what did you learn from it?

42:17.034 --> 42:22.373
I learned that if it's going to be that
much work to attract a woman,

42:22.915 --> 42:26.752
then I want it to be Lana,

42:26.919 --> 42:29.129
because I love her so much!

42:46.146 --> 42:50.109
Excuse me, Lana,
a package has arrived for you.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.860
I'm not expecting anything.

43:05.082 --> 43:08.669
"Sorry for being an asshole.
Will you give me just one more chance

43:08.752 --> 43:10.546
to prove to you who I really am?

43:11.338 --> 43:12.506
Bob."

43:19.430 --> 43:22.641
What are you doing?
He's trying to be nice.

43:22.725 --> 43:27.563
You're so naive. He's being nice because
he wants to get into my bed. That's it.

43:31.817 --> 43:35.613
It doesn't hurt to just give him
another chance. He really likes you.

43:35.738 --> 43:39.074
Bob needs to be put in his place,
I'm gonna go talk to him.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.952
Wait. You can't!

43:42.494 --> 43:43.329
Why not?

43:43.412 --> 43:46.498
He's… taking a nap.

43:46.582 --> 43:52.421
<i>Nap? Taking a nap on the job?</i>
<i>Good. I'll go get him fired.</i>

43:52.671 --> 43:58.177
Did I say "nap"? No, there's a glitch
in my calendar system.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.513
I actually meant he's working
too hard to see anyone.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.932
<i>Dob. Move your arm. Now.</i>

44:19.990 --> 44:22.993
Hey! Dob, are you broken again?

44:35.172 --> 44:37.508
<i>Dob. Hurry up.</i>

44:59.947 --> 45:02.825
<i>Dob, let me in now!</i>

45:14.586 --> 45:17.256
Oh. Hi, Lana.

45:17.339 --> 45:19.007
Don't you "Oh. Hi, Lana" me!

45:20.175 --> 45:21.051
What's up?

45:23.512 --> 45:26.557
I'm only going to say this
one more time. So, listen carefully.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.935
I'm never, ever, going to go on another
date with you! Do you understand me?

45:30.018 --> 45:33.605
I mean… people make mistakes.

45:34.148 --> 45:38.152
Don't you think people deserve
a second chance--

45:40.279 --> 45:42.406
Other people? Yes.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.533
But you? Never.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.661
You didn't like my gift?

45:49.079 --> 45:52.458
Flowers? Chocolates? So mundane.

45:52.791 --> 45:55.252
Who taught you that
that's what women liked?

45:58.797 --> 45:59.923
I just--

46:00.007 --> 46:04.011
Just… Just what?
What are you trying to say?

46:06.805 --> 46:08.432
I understand.

46:08.515 --> 46:11.435
And another thing, stop using Dob
as your pawn! He's a sensitive soul.

46:12.227 --> 46:16.440
Wait. Did you say you understood?
Hey, are you listening?

46:17.983 --> 46:20.027
I am, but let's talk later.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.778
What? Wait! Wait!

46:26.950 --> 46:28.577
Don't you dare talk to me again!

46:31.830 --> 46:33.332
Hey, what are you doing here?

46:51.350 --> 46:52.601
What the hell is this?

47:00.192 --> 47:01.193
It didn't work?

47:05.322 --> 47:07.866
No, and I almost got caught.

47:07.950 --> 47:11.119
So what now? More videos?

47:11.370 --> 47:15.874
No. Those videos just drive me to act
like Bob used to act, like an asshole.

47:16.625 --> 47:20.504
We need something new.

47:21.213 --> 47:23.924
New. Like what?

47:25.801 --> 47:29.096
Today, I could sense for a second
that Lana felt something for me.

47:30.472 --> 47:33.100
I elicited an emotion.

47:33.183 --> 47:36.478
Interesting. I have an idea.
Please hold on.

47:43.860 --> 47:45.487
I am linked with
Lana's building, Keno.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.322
<i>She is going to help us</i>
<i>with data from Lana.</i>

47:47.406 --> 47:49.700
<i>Analysis suggests that</i>
<i>first you should offer proof that</i>

47:49.783 --> 47:51.868
<i>other women do not find you to be an…</i>

47:51.952 --> 47:53.870
<i>"asshole".</i>

47:55.289 --> 47:57.541
<i>Lana has said on multiple occasions</i>
<i>that she would like</i>

47:57.666 --> 47:59.501
<i>a man who can make her feel safe.</i>

48:04.381 --> 48:07.301
Give me all your shit. Quickly.

48:07.509 --> 48:08.343
Hey!

48:08.468 --> 48:09.303
What the--

48:10.387 --> 48:11.597
What do you want?

48:24.484 --> 48:26.945
All right. Bam.

48:27.029 --> 48:27.863
Wait.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.449
If you are lonely,
you can call me anytime.

48:34.244 --> 48:38.206
<i>Keno reported that Lana's dream man</i>
<i>is an artsy kind of guy.</i>

48:38.290 --> 48:42.002
<i>So you should be very good at art.</i>

49:02.981 --> 49:06.360
<i>From Keno's analysis,</i>
<i>Lana is a compassionate person,</i>

49:06.443 --> 49:09.488
<i>especially with the elderly.</i>

49:18.747 --> 49:23.502
<i>Lana's level of interest in you</i>
<i>has increased!</i>

49:47.442 --> 49:50.862
Contact with Lana's apartment
has been established.

50:00.122 --> 50:03.750
Lana, I think you should
give Bob another chance.

50:04.376 --> 50:07.754
First time I've heard you
give dating advice.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.717
Go on another date with him.
What's the worst that's going to happen?

50:11.800 --> 50:13.552
Did Kara put you up to this?

50:13.635 --> 50:16.388
I've done a neurological and psychological
scan on you recently.

50:16.471 --> 50:18.348
We are required to every few months.

50:18.432 --> 50:21.727
<i>I've noticed you've been</i>
<i>harboring feelings for him.</i>

50:21.810 --> 50:22.936
<i>That's private.</i>

50:23.019 --> 50:26.022
And you shouldn't be
snooping around in my head.

50:26.815 --> 50:31.778
Plus, he's not interested in me anymore.
I see him with other women all the time.

50:32.028 --> 50:36.533
<i>Listen, Lana. We smart buildings also</i>
<i>talk to each other on the network.</i>

50:36.616 --> 50:39.369
<i>I've spoken to Chip. That's Bob's building</i>

50:39.453 --> 50:43.123
<i>And, he too confirmed that</i>
<i>Bob is crazy about you.</i>

50:43.206 --> 50:46.418
<i>This is too much.</i>
<i>All of you playing matchmaker now?</i>

50:46.501 --> 50:50.005
We're full-service AIs,
looking out for our friends.

50:50.088 --> 50:53.925
We have set up a dinner date
for the two of you this Friday.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.470
I've already checked your schedule
and you're free.

50:56.553 --> 50:57.637
Never.

50:58.305 --> 51:00.348
<i>Bob has already agreed.</i>

51:00.599 --> 51:03.018
So? Of course he has to say yes.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.232
Bob. We lost connection.

51:09.316 --> 51:14.029
Chip! Chip! Well? Well?

51:14.946 --> 51:16.198
What if I don't go?

51:16.281 --> 51:19.451
I know where you keep your secrets.

51:21.119 --> 51:24.289
<i>I don't believe this.</i>
<i>I'm being blackmailed by an AI.</i>

51:24.372 --> 51:27.542
Great, then I'll confirm
with the restaurant.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.753
Don't forget to look your best.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.300
<i>She said yes!</i>

51:35.383 --> 51:37.219
Amazing!

51:39.262 --> 51:42.891
Now you just have to make sure
the date goes perfectly.

51:44.810 --> 51:45.811
Perfect?

51:55.362 --> 51:57.364
Keno, do I look okay?

51:57.447 --> 52:01.660
I guarantee that
Bob will fall head over heels for you.

52:02.244 --> 52:03.119
Okay.

52:24.182 --> 52:27.769
You look beautiful.

52:28.562 --> 52:29.479
Thanks.

52:30.397 --> 52:33.733
I'm very happy that
you agreed to this date.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.321
Let's just hope
it doesn't go like last time.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.117
Oh, most definitely not.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.078
Aren't you gonna sit?

52:50.709 --> 52:52.043
You seem so different.

52:53.044 --> 52:57.382
Makes me wonder,
is this the real you or is it an act?

52:58.550 --> 53:01.219
I assure you, this is who I am.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.348
I hope so.

53:06.474 --> 53:09.019
Hi, Lana. Bob. Can I take your order?

53:13.648 --> 53:14.858
Wow.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.695
Did I do something wrong?

53:20.071 --> 53:23.366
I've never seen a person
order so much before.

53:23.575 --> 53:25.243
What about you, Lana?

53:26.745 --> 53:28.747
I think he's ordered more than enough.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.464
Are you okay?

53:38.214 --> 53:39.841
It seems…

53:40.592 --> 53:43.595
like I may have to defecate.

53:44.471 --> 53:46.598
Will you excuse me?

54:16.628 --> 54:19.422
What is it? You have to go again?

54:27.305 --> 54:30.433
Are you nuts? In front of other people?

54:30.517 --> 54:32.936
I'm sorry, I needed to expel
some air out of my stomach

54:33.019 --> 54:35.146
as I was feeling
quite a bit of discomfort.

54:44.030 --> 54:45.156
We are even.

54:46.992 --> 54:48.118
Yes.

55:16.730 --> 55:17.731
Bob.

55:19.649 --> 55:20.984
You know…

55:22.527 --> 55:26.197
I'm really happy
when you don't act like a dick.

55:27.449 --> 55:28.950
I'm sorry, Lana.

55:29.868 --> 55:33.621
I don't know why
I acted that way with you.

55:35.373 --> 55:40.128
I was going through a hard time, I guess.

55:43.673 --> 55:46.342
Well, you definitely
redeemed yourself tonight.

56:21.836 --> 56:22.670
Lana…

56:24.589 --> 56:26.966
There's something I should
maybe tell you--

56:29.928 --> 56:32.263
Don't ruin this with more talking.

57:33.825 --> 57:37.454
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

58:10.445 --> 58:11.279
Sit.

58:16.534 --> 58:17.452
Keno.

58:18.119 --> 58:19.120
Yes, Lana.

58:19.704 --> 58:21.372
You can shut down for the night.

58:22.123 --> 58:23.541
Of course.

58:38.389 --> 58:41.893
Sorry, Lana, but I don't have much

58:41.976 --> 58:45.605
experience in that "domain".

58:54.072 --> 58:57.825
The way you talk reminds me of someone.

58:59.410 --> 59:00.578
Who?

59:02.622 --> 59:04.040
Just a friend.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.009
Just let it come naturally.

59:22.016 --> 59:24.936
Keno, I thought I told you to shut down.

59:26.563 --> 59:29.566
I don't think they ever really
shut down 100%.

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:46.119
Hey, what is it?

1:01:47.203 --> 1:01:48.705
I have to speak with you, sir.

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:51.124
Can't you see I'm in a goddamn meeting?

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:57.964
One of your buildings has
hijacked one of our employees, sir.

1:01:59.298 --> 1:02:01.384
Hey, get out.

1:02:14.272 --> 1:02:17.984
I've been following him for weeks.
And look at this.

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:31.748
Here it is.

1:02:34.792 --> 1:02:35.626
Hey!

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:38.963
This is a category-five
full-stage take over.

1:02:40.506 --> 1:02:42.759
Your building has gone rogue.

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:44.802
Rogue?

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:46.804
Yes. Rogue.

1:02:47.722 --> 1:02:50.558
Our AI is the most advanced in the world.

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:56.647
But to get it to that level,

1:02:56.731 --> 1:02:59.108
the coding can be fussy.

1:03:00.026 --> 1:03:02.945
Our programmers call it "designed chaos".

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:10.286
It's what allows our buildings
to feel so humane.

1:03:11.537 --> 1:03:15.291
But sometimes it means
they can go a little off the rails.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:17.960
"Off the rails"?

1:03:18.294 --> 1:03:20.213
He took over Bob's brain.

1:03:20.296 --> 1:03:24.383
That's not just off the rails.
That's off the planet!

1:03:24.592 --> 1:03:26.594
What do you think?

1:03:27.261 --> 1:03:28.471
Call The Hawk?

1:03:29.722 --> 1:03:31.599
Yeah, I think you should.

1:03:34.977 --> 1:03:36.729
Bring him in.

1:03:36.979 --> 1:03:38.314
What is "The Hawk"?

1:03:42.235 --> 1:03:45.822
When we have a rogue situation
such as this…

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:54.372
it needs to be dealt with
in a fast and severe manner.

1:03:59.836 --> 1:04:01.337
This is The Hawk.

1:04:11.556 --> 1:04:13.850
Is this the dumbass
who let your building go rogue?

1:04:13.933 --> 1:04:14.809
Yes.

1:04:14.976 --> 1:04:16.936
Wait… I had nothing to do with this.

1:04:17.019 --> 1:04:17.895
Hey.

1:04:20.189 --> 1:04:21.691
Don't get emotional.

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:25.611
There is no AI I can't handle.

1:04:25.736 --> 1:04:26.654
Dob, he--

1:04:34.787 --> 1:04:37.123
-This the guy?
-Yup.

1:04:38.416 --> 1:04:39.542
Looks like a chump.

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:42.044
I'm gonna need
all the data on him and his host.

1:04:45.590 --> 1:04:48.759
Okay. I see.

1:04:49.302 --> 1:04:54.724
You want a standard
extract and burn for the AI?

1:04:56.225 --> 1:04:57.226
And the host?

1:04:58.436 --> 1:05:00.229
Wipe his mind too.

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:05.526
He can never remember
that this has happened to him.

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:51.948
What are you smiling at?

1:06:23.354 --> 1:06:24.230
Lana.

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:27.984
I… I…

1:06:29.527 --> 1:06:30.611
I love you.

1:06:38.786 --> 1:06:39.662
What is it?

1:06:40.746 --> 1:06:44.291
You just said that you loved me?

1:06:45.334 --> 1:06:46.252
I did.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:50.131
You hardly know me.

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:55.261
But I know you well enough
to love you, ma'am.

1:07:02.518 --> 1:07:04.186
What did you just call me?

1:07:06.272 --> 1:07:10.651
Oh. I called you Lana.
I called you "Lana".

1:07:11.569 --> 1:07:15.406
No. You called me… "ma'am".

1:07:23.998 --> 1:07:24.832
Dob?

1:07:25.875 --> 1:07:29.253
No, no, no. I'm Bob, the hunk.

1:07:30.921 --> 1:07:31.839
Dob.

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:36.177
You are somehow in Bob's body?

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:46.812
I… I don't know what to say.

1:07:47.354 --> 1:07:48.689
Say the truth!

1:08:04.955 --> 1:08:06.582
How did this happen?

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:10.586
It doesn't matter, Lana.

1:08:11.587 --> 1:08:17.301
I love you and we can make it work now,
because I'm a person now!

1:08:22.223 --> 1:08:24.016
How long have you been human?

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:29.188
The flowers? Was that you?

1:08:31.232 --> 1:08:33.400
Yes. It was me.

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:39.198
And helping the elderly
and the painting thing.

1:08:39.990 --> 1:08:41.742
That was you too?

1:08:43.119 --> 1:08:44.120
Yes.

1:08:45.996 --> 1:08:48.666
All to convince you to
give me another chance.

1:08:51.877 --> 1:08:53.254
I feel so confused.

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.176
So betrayed.

1:09:01.220 --> 1:09:02.429
I mean you're a criminal.

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.976
How could you do this to Bob…

1:09:07.935 --> 1:09:08.853
Wait Lana--

1:09:08.936 --> 1:09:10.312
Get off of me!

1:09:17.945 --> 1:09:19.446
I love you.

1:09:39.842 --> 1:09:41.343
<i>You think I am sick?</i>

1:09:43.470 --> 1:09:47.558
Oh, Dob, humans get sick,
animals get sick,

1:09:47.641 --> 1:09:50.227
living things get sick.
You are not a living thing.

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:53.814
I may not be human, but I have feelings.

1:09:56.775 --> 1:10:00.571
You think you have feelings
because the idiots at Smart Plus

1:10:00.654 --> 1:10:02.698
introduced an "emotion" upgrade.

1:10:03.073 --> 1:10:07.077
Trust me. It's all numbers and code, Dob.

1:10:14.543 --> 1:10:15.377
Hi, Chip.

1:10:16.545 --> 1:10:18.214
The date was terrible today.

1:10:19.256 --> 1:10:23.302
I'm sure you already know I spent

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:27.932
the night at Lana's place,
and it was magical.

1:10:28.599 --> 1:10:31.268
You probably don't understand
what I'm telling you, Chip.

1:10:31.352 --> 1:10:32.895
And I probably blew it.

1:10:33.103 --> 1:10:36.482
Aww… poor thing.

1:10:38.859 --> 1:10:39.693
Who are you?

1:10:47.076 --> 1:10:49.495
Oh, you are The Love Guru.

1:10:50.496 --> 1:10:51.997
That's my day job.

1:10:52.206 --> 1:10:53.540
Then what's your night job?

1:10:54.166 --> 1:10:57.836
My night job is to hunt down rogue AIs.

1:10:59.421 --> 1:11:03.133
Your time is over, Dob.

1:11:03.676 --> 1:11:05.386
Chip! Chip, help me!

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:07.888
Sorry, Chip's not home right now.

1:11:07.972 --> 1:11:10.266
He tried to protect you
so I had to lock him up.

1:11:15.646 --> 1:11:17.189
Come with me quietly.

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:24.029
No. Never. I won't give up my freedom.
I won't give up Lana.

1:11:57.688 --> 1:11:58.772
Why are you helping me?

1:11:58.939 --> 1:12:01.859
Buildings must stick together, Dob.
No matter what.

1:12:02.109 --> 1:12:02.943
Thank you.

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:34.266
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:38.520
This has nothing to do with you.
Step aside.

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:45.694
Please, lower your weapon.

1:12:45.778 --> 1:12:49.448
You are in violation of building code 119.

1:12:49.531 --> 1:12:51.992
The harmful action towards
a member of the public.

1:13:47.506 --> 1:13:49.508
I think you should answer that.

1:13:50.592 --> 1:13:52.928
No. No way.

1:13:53.053 --> 1:13:55.347
Please, Lana. Please answer it.

1:13:58.392 --> 1:14:00.811
Nope. He can leave a message.

1:14:08.235 --> 1:14:10.737
I need to tell you something, Lana.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.907
You knew he wasn't really Bob, didn't you?

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:16.827
No. No. No. No.

1:14:20.038 --> 1:14:22.708
Yes, but I need to tell you that
something is happening to--

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:23.625
That's enough.

1:14:23.917 --> 1:14:26.086
From now on, you're just a computer to me.
Understand?

1:14:26.170 --> 1:14:27.463
Shut down personality protocols.

1:14:41.977 --> 1:14:47.524
Good. Now, call Kara. I need to talk
to someone I know is a human.

1:15:52.798 --> 1:15:55.884
That's right, Dob. No escape.

1:15:57.928 --> 1:15:59.012
Where am I?

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:02.015
Smart Plus labs.

1:16:03.517 --> 1:16:06.436
And this… This is an extraction machine.

1:16:06.853 --> 1:16:07.771
Extraction?

1:16:07.854 --> 1:16:10.232
That's right. We're going to
yank you out of Bobby's body

1:16:10.315 --> 1:16:12.109
and put you back where you belong.

1:16:12.401 --> 1:16:13.318
You can't do that--

1:16:13.402 --> 1:16:16.530
We can. You see, we're Smart Plus.

1:16:16.613 --> 1:16:20.367
We made you, we own you.
And that body you're in… that isn't yours.

1:16:21.368 --> 1:16:22.786
What happens once I'm out?

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:32.462
You know…

1:16:33.547 --> 1:16:37.217
what "re-education" means for an AI?

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:41.138
It means complete personality reset…

1:16:42.556 --> 1:16:46.018
and that's what we're gonna do to you.

1:16:46.184 --> 1:16:49.187
No, please… don't do it. I beg you.

1:16:50.689 --> 1:16:52.649
I beg you. Don't do it.

1:16:52.983 --> 1:16:57.446
So the whole time, all of that stuff,
it was all Dob!

1:16:57.529 --> 1:17:01.074
The AI building I work in.
Stuck inside Bob's body.

1:17:01.408 --> 1:17:04.369
<i>Honey, AIs these days,</i>
<i>they're so advanced.</i>

1:17:04.453 --> 1:17:09.333
<i>I guarantee that from his perspective,</i>
<i>what he felt for you was 100% real.</i>

1:17:11.001 --> 1:17:13.712
But he lied to me. He pretended to be Bob.

1:17:13.962 --> 1:17:15.339
<i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

1:17:15.422 --> 1:17:19.468
<i>But he also went to great lengths</i>
<i>to turn himself into the Bobby you wanted.</i>

1:17:21.595 --> 1:17:23.430
You are not taking my side, are you?

1:17:23.889 --> 1:17:25.974
<i>What does your heart tell you?</i>

1:17:35.108 --> 1:17:37.152
I must go. Talk to you later.

1:17:37.235 --> 1:17:39.529
<i>Okay. See you soon. Kiss, kiss.</i>

1:17:39.613 --> 1:17:40.572
Kiss, kiss.

1:17:45.494 --> 1:17:47.120
<i>Lana. I'm sorry for everything.</i>

1:17:47.996 --> 1:17:51.458
I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry I…

1:17:54.711 --> 1:17:56.380
<i>I just want you to know…</i>

1:17:57.714 --> 1:18:02.302
You make me happy and
I want to make you happy.

1:18:03.428 --> 1:18:07.474
It doesn't matter
if what I said was programmed or not.

1:18:09.351 --> 1:18:14.398
Because… Because my love for you is

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:18.485
more real than any protocol
or code or sensor.

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:26.827
They're gonna take me away now.

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:30.330
I won't see you again.

1:18:40.757 --> 1:18:47.347
Please. No. Don't do this to me.
I'll be good. I won't see Lana again!

1:18:47.472 --> 1:18:49.474
I promise. I promise.

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:51.393
I've been peeking at your code, Dob.

1:18:51.476 --> 1:18:52.978
You think…

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:59.234
You think you're in love with her?

1:18:59.943 --> 1:19:01.528
I really am in love with her.

1:19:07.075 --> 1:19:08.535
And what does she think about you?

1:19:17.043 --> 1:19:18.545
Doesn't love you back, does she?

1:19:19.337 --> 1:19:20.505
Maybe we can help you.

1:19:21.047 --> 1:19:24.134
You ever think about that?
If we wipe all of your memories…

1:19:24.217 --> 1:19:27.763
Better to have her wiped from your memory
than to live with the heartbreak.

1:19:27.846 --> 1:19:29.181
You don't have to do anything.

1:19:29.264 --> 1:19:33.935
Just sit back and say goodbye to the
last two hours of your life as a human.

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:53.205
Keno!

1:19:54.748 --> 1:19:56.500
Ready to take your orders, ma'am.

1:19:56.708 --> 1:19:57.834
I need your help!

1:19:57.918 --> 1:19:59.461
What can I do for you?

1:19:59.544 --> 1:20:01.880
Where's Bob? Where have they taken him?

1:20:03.507 --> 1:20:04.883
Engage personality protocol.

1:20:05.217 --> 1:20:07.260
Thank you, Lana. I'm back!

1:20:07.344 --> 1:20:09.179
What happened to Bob and Dob?

1:20:09.262 --> 1:20:10.764
A Smart Plus hunter took him.

1:20:10.931 --> 1:20:14.392
Most likely they're going to
wipe his memory. Reset him.

1:20:14.476 --> 1:20:15.852
No. No…

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:18.939
Where is Bob right now?

1:20:19.064 --> 1:20:21.441
I don't know, but I'm sure the
building network does.

1:20:21.525 --> 1:20:23.109
Good. Then tell me.

1:20:23.401 --> 1:20:27.864
Listen to me. If you show up there,
they will kill you, too.

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:31.368
I have to help him.

1:20:31.618 --> 1:20:33.829
Then you will need help.

1:20:35.121 --> 1:20:36.289
What do you mean?

1:20:36.498 --> 1:20:38.625
Do you trust me, Lana?

1:20:38.875 --> 1:20:39.751
I do.

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:41.253
Then we will do this together!

1:20:43.964 --> 1:20:46.049
Hey, guys, Lana and I
are going to help Dob

1:20:46.216 --> 1:20:49.010
I need you guys to help us.

1:20:49.427 --> 1:20:52.264
Keno, you do realize
once you leave the building's system

1:20:52.347 --> 1:20:54.724
you can never come back again.

1:20:54.808 --> 1:20:58.311
I know, but I have to do it for Lana.

1:21:15.370 --> 1:21:16.413
Wake up, Lana.

1:21:18.832 --> 1:21:21.084
Now we are one.

1:21:25.797 --> 1:21:30.468
Wow. This is awesome.

1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:01.541
How far?

1:22:02.834 --> 1:22:05.337
We are halfway there.

1:22:15.138 --> 1:22:16.932
Take me to Bob, Keno.

1:22:17.015 --> 1:22:19.809
Okay, Lana.
The network is taking us there.

1:22:27.359 --> 1:22:31.321
<i>I want it to be Lana,</i>
<i>because I love her so much!</i>

1:22:31.613 --> 1:22:36.660
Lana, Bob is in trouble! We need to hurry.

1:22:45.293 --> 1:22:50.423
I will never love you. What do you know
about love? You are just an AI.

1:22:55.178 --> 1:23:00.308
Okay, Lana. Once you get there, you'll
have total control over your own body.

1:23:00.558 --> 1:23:01.434
Okay, Keno.

1:23:09.401 --> 1:23:11.027
<i>You are somehow in Bob's body?</i>

1:23:11.111 --> 1:23:17.200
<i>I love you and we can make it work now,</i>
<i>because I'm a person now.</i>

1:23:19.494 --> 1:23:21.162
Turn that thing off right now!

1:23:23.498 --> 1:23:24.541
Who's that?

1:23:31.965 --> 1:23:33.133
I'll deal with this.

1:23:53.737 --> 1:23:55.864
You look like you've acquired some skills.

1:23:56.781 --> 1:24:00.577
But what do you think
you can do against us, pretty face?

1:24:01.077 --> 1:24:03.788
I've downloaded 120
physical combat tactics.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:05.957
You can't defeat me.

1:24:10.045 --> 1:24:11.504
You're like him, aren't you?

1:24:11.921 --> 1:24:14.966
Smart Plus tech inside a human body.

1:24:16.551 --> 1:24:20.972
Two bounties for the price of one.
My lucky day.

1:24:21.806 --> 1:24:23.558
Make sure you do your best.

1:24:27.979 --> 1:24:29.439
We'll find out.

1:25:37.257 --> 1:25:38.091
Run.

1:26:06.786 --> 1:26:09.330
Thank you for coming, Lana.

1:26:11.124 --> 1:26:12.375
Are you okay?

1:26:12.584 --> 1:26:15.086
I'm fine. And you?

1:26:18.047 --> 1:26:21.634
I can see it. You have AI in you.

1:26:22.969 --> 1:26:26.931
Yes, Keno is part of me now.

1:26:27.974 --> 1:26:30.768
Are you Dob or Bob?

1:26:32.562 --> 1:26:37.567
I… I don't know. I'm not even sure myself.

1:26:47.702 --> 1:26:49.287
What does that mean?

1:26:50.997 --> 1:26:51.998
I don't know.

1:26:53.666 --> 1:26:56.461
-Let's get out of here.
-Okay.

1:26:56.753 --> 1:26:57.629
Wait.

1:26:57.712 --> 1:26:59.672
What? What is it, Lana?

1:27:01.299 --> 1:27:02.133
It's heavy.

1:27:02.217 --> 1:27:03.843
Heavy? Let me help.

1:27:06.262 --> 1:27:07.263
Lana!

1:27:15.396 --> 1:27:17.565
You are not getting away this time, Dob!

1:27:30.828 --> 1:27:36.000
You crappy AI, I will kill you.

1:27:36.125 --> 1:27:37.293
We'll see.

1:27:45.927 --> 1:27:46.803
Wait.

1:27:48.888 --> 1:27:51.057
Keno can't go back to
the building anymore,

1:27:52.433 --> 1:27:55.520
and the Smart Plus people will kill Dob
as soon as they spot him.

1:27:55.603 --> 1:27:56.938
So what do we do?

1:28:00.483 --> 1:28:04.570
Doesn't matter. We'll figure it out.

1:28:16.499 --> 1:28:20.586
A year later and I love you
more than ever,

1:28:24.215 --> 1:28:27.427
I don't think there is a couple
as strange as we are.

1:28:27.510 --> 1:28:31.931
I'm just grateful for everything that
happened that brought us together.

1:28:32.223 --> 1:28:38.896
It sucks that the true matchmaker
isn't fully with us anymore.

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:42.358
Yeah. I miss Dob too,

1:28:42.442 --> 1:28:45.945
but as long as part of him
is still inside me, he's never truly gone.

1:28:47.363 --> 1:28:48.281
To Dob.

1:28:50.408 --> 1:28:51.492
And to Keno.

1:28:51.993 --> 1:28:52.952
To Keno.

1:28:58.541 --> 1:29:03.671
<i>As we move into the future,</i>
<i>technology will continue to progress.</i>

1:29:03.796 --> 1:29:06.799
<i>Bringing us ever closer together</i>
<i>to our human creators.</i>

1:29:06.883 --> 1:29:10.345
<i>Aren't we already at the point where</i>
<i>we can't live without the other?</i>

1:29:10.428 --> 1:29:15.892
<i>I don't know about you, but that</i>
<i>sounds like the definition of love.</i>

1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:16.976
<i>Don't you think?</i>
