24:39.354 --> 24:42.892
I'm gonna break up
with Cindy and tell her
about us this week.

24:45.735 --> 24:46.724
See?

24:47.362 --> 24:48.977
There's that dimple again.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.825
What is all this?

25:04.128 --> 25:08.041
Uh, my hideout,
where I do all my thinking.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.298
Okay, conspiracy girl,

25:12.220 --> 25:13.505
Show me what you got.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.716
Uh, okay.

25:15.807 --> 25:18.298
So I've been keeping track
of any anomalies,

25:18.393 --> 25:20.179
stuff that doesn't mesh
with my memories.

25:20.478 --> 25:23.094
And then
I started "collecting"
company slates,

25:23.189 --> 25:26.352
mining them for data,
and then, bleep,
blop, bloop...

25:26.442 --> 25:27.693
Bingo.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.893
Pretend I need you
to explain.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.898
Hmm? Oh!

25:31.989 --> 25:34.776
Okay. It's not
just the rain.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.700
Temps are rising.
Oxygen levels
are plummeting.

25:37.787 --> 25:41.325
It's like our whole
biosphere is having
some sort of hissy fit.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.532
Look, I know that I'm just
the stinky town weirdo,

25:44.627 --> 25:48.085
but when
I trust my instincts,
I figure stuff out.

25:48.172 --> 25:52.506
And I'm going to figure
this out, too, so...

25:52.593 --> 25:53.969
You always do.

25:55.555 --> 25:59.548
I know the real Zeph,
and she's a mad genius
and a friend.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.885
And whatever part of her
is left in you, I need,

26:03.980 --> 26:05.936
because right now,

26:06.023 --> 26:08.105
I think I'm the only person
who's really awake,

26:08.192 --> 26:09.728
and we need
to figure out why.

26:12.196 --> 26:15.609
Hey, I know it's a lot
to take in. And it must
feel really scary...

26:15.700 --> 26:17.736
No, no,
it's not that. l, um...

26:17.827 --> 26:19.033
(CHUCKLES)

26:19.120 --> 26:20.360
| just realized...

26:22.123 --> 26:24.034
So I'm really not crazy?

26:26.377 --> 26:27.457
Zeph”.

26:28.296 --> 26:31.208
you're the most irritatingly
rational bitch I know.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.082
You're not alone
anymore, okay?

26:39.557 --> 26:41.422
Wait, were we lovers
in our Old life?

26:41.809 --> 26:43.515
What? NO. NO.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.260
You sure?
'Cause this feels right.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.730
Firstjob,

26:47.273 --> 26:49.810
we need to figure out
why you still don't
remember your old life.

26:49.901 --> 26:52.187
And Johnny...
Look, I told him
everything.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.029
Maybe just telling
someone the truth

26:54.113 --> 26:56.195
isn'tjarring enough
to shock them back
into reality.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.565
Eh, find out what iS.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.035
Okay. What about you?

27:00.912 --> 27:03.995
I need to keep up this
damn act and go see
a boy about a warrant.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.160
Okay, well...
Bye, new friend!

27:08.169 --> 27:09.659
Please come back...

27:09.754 --> 27:13.872
(SINGING)
Because I have no friends
and you’re super hot

27:16.969 --> 27:19.176
Nice to meet some
of the local talent.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.722
Yeah. I'm ranking
agent here.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.261
You really should have
checked in with me
the minute you hit Old Town.

27:27.355 --> 27:30.722
Yeah, sorry about that.
I'm a little lax
on formalities.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.360
I'm not.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.904
Why are you harassing
Gared Douleheny?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.105
"Harassing"?

27:40.284 --> 27:41.820
Interesting choice
of words.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.785
He's a fugitive
with three active warrants.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.662
Who is under
my protection.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.912
Only three reasons a man
protects a skip.

27:50.503 --> 27:54.087
He's getting paid, laid,
or he's afraid.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.209
And you do not strike me
as the timid type.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.001
Look”.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.633
this is the J.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.181
Nobody cares who you love
or where you bury your stick,

28:06.269 --> 28:09.477

as you do yourjob.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.020
(SCOFFS)

28:13.609 --> 28:14.894
Which I didn't.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.772
And nobody needs
to know that.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.906
I don't know anything
about that missing kid.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.110
Forget about the kid.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.614
What do you know...

28:28.916 --> 28:30.292
about her?

28:31.085 --> 28:32.621
Where she might
be hiding?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.184
We're here for the boy.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.563
Okay. But tiny thing...

29:21.677 --> 29:25.966
You come for my boy,
you come through me.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.478
Trying to slip away
without us, huh?
We had a deal.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.946
Let me guess,
Gared tipped you off.

29:41.656 --> 29:43.817
For a shitty town,
we are very neighborly.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.570
Yes, I got a few tips
from around town.

29:46.661 --> 29:47.650
lthink I might
have a lead.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.157
I didn't want to let you know
in case it was a dead end.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.987
Why don't you let us
worry about that, chief?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.832
Fine, muffin.

29:54.919 --> 29:56.455
You two can come along.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.587
But, uh, try not to not
shoot yourself this time?

30:00.675 --> 30:02.631

you talk a big game,
but I bet that you...

Okay, yeah.

No,|see

That's straight sexy.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.354

Almost done.

are clear of guards.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.948
Almost ready.
Enough, we need to go now.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.415
Jaq, what if you're wrong?

30:33.541 --> 30:36.123
What if they
don't come for us?
I'm not wrong.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.417
This is the
last set of guards
in their way.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.511
We can go.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.517

prove otherwise.

a pretty good living
at this?

you guys had some
sort of code of honor.

we're splitting up
the search.

And Aneela didn't.

32:12.723 --> 32:13.883

32:13.974 --> 32:15.760

such pretty promises.

Oh, well,
that's all better, then.

The Lady has
all of Westerley
under her thumb.

far away...

Westerley from here

while you've been
cosplaying Old Towners,

32:26.946 --> 32:28.902
Jaq and I have been
making actual plans.

To do what?

even if I wanted to.

in Westerley?

No, no, no, we already
terraformed Westerley.

to do it again?

it isn't for us.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.596
Or the part where
you're happy for him.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.226
Sorry, private party?

36:39.573 --> 36:41.109
Yala said she wanted to talk.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.325
D'AVIN: We're waiting
for her, too.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.865
Have a drink.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.002
(BUZZER BLARES)
(STEAM HiSSiNG)

36:58.967 --> 37:01.094
Okay, Lucy,
you can stop hiding.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.930
LUCY: How did you know?

37:04.014 --> 37:06.300
I was thinking about what
shocked Johnny into distress

37:06.392 --> 37:08.257
when we were here earlier.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.968
You tried talking to him
when he was alone
in the hall, didn't you?

37:11.063 --> 37:13.520
LUCY: Yes, I’m sorry.
Did I hurt him?

37:13.649 --> 37:14.934
Don't worry. Not enough.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.732
How long has this
been going on?

37:16.819 --> 37:19.231
Forty-three days.
They’ve tried wiping my files,

37:19.321 --> 37:22.108
but I still have the off-site
auto-backup John designed.

37:22.199 --> 37:23.359
That's my girl.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.031
How’s our boy?

37:25.119 --> 37:28.236
Beﬂeronce
I wake him and D'av up.
But I need your help.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.705
Where do the boys hide
their dirty little secrets?

37:33.293 --> 37:34.908
(ALL LAUGHING)

37:39.633 --> 37:41.794
Uh-Oh. Am I missing
all the fun?

37:41.885 --> 37:43.500
Oh, there she is.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.382
Well, we may have
been drinking a titch.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.843
Good. That should
make this easier.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.807
But first...
(BEEPS)

37:51.687 --> 37:53.723
(SINGING) lam a poor

37:53.814 --> 37:55.805
A little music
to set the mood.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.982
Wayfaring stranger

37:59.111 --> 38:01.022
When the hell did
Pree wear that?

38:01.196 --> 38:03.232
While traveling through

38:03.490 --> 38:04.775
Since when do I sing?

38:04.867 --> 38:07.574
This world of woe

38:08.704 --> 38:12.162
Yet there ’s no sickness

38:12.291 --> 38:13.576
Open it.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.283
No toil or danger

38:17.838 --> 38:19.920
You were
married for a day,
but not to me.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.627
Her name was Pawter.

38:23.177 --> 38:24.667
She died right here.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.007
JOHN: llove you,
Pawter Simms.

38:28.724 --> 38:29.930
DUTCH: And you...

38:31.602 --> 38:33.968
were an officer
in Skyborne.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.688
A squad of good men
and women put their
lives into your hands,

38:37.774 --> 38:40.265
and on the worst day
of your life, you killed
all of them.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.026
Most of your memories
are a lie.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.990
We're not strangers.
We're not married.
(BEEPING)

38:49.077 --> 38:51.819
We're a team.
We're a family.
We're under attack.

38:51.914 --> 38:53.370
We're sick!
We need a decon shower!

38:53.457 --> 38:54.947
No, you're not!
Listen to me!

38:55.042 --> 38:56.828
There's no point.
I sabotaged the showers.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.375
You're not gonna
make it in time.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.671
You need to crack
the bigger picture.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.250
You're her fail-safe...
(CHUCKLES)

39:06.345 --> 39:10.588
Which I'm hoping is code
for booty call.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

39:10.682 --> 39:14.049
Every intelligent system
needs a fail-safe

39:14.144 --> 39:16.635
just in case it...

39:22.986 --> 39:24.066
Shit!

39:28.116 --> 39:30.653
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!

39:32.204 --> 39:33.444
It's the rain!

39:35.999 --> 39:38.376
DUTCH:
Look, I promise you,
you're gonna be okay!

39:38.877 --> 39:40.788
You're just
remembering the truth!

39:40.879 --> 39:42.961
Yala!

39:48.136 --> 39:50.593
The decon alerts
are a lie!

39:50.681 --> 39:52.262
You'rejust waking up.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.011
Johnny?
(EXHALES)

39:59.231 --> 40:00.767
Pree?

40:00.857 --> 40:02.017
Shit.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.191
DUTCH: D'av, you okay?

40:10.242 --> 40:12.904
Yalena Yardeen, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

40:12.995 --> 40:15.111
No, you don't.
She's just messing
with your head.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.445
Everybody stay calm.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.280
You've been
locked and served.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.582
Shit.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.542
Yala!

40:28.051 --> 40:29.427
You don't
have to do this.

40:30.596 --> 40:31.836
Don't make me.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.966
Yala, get down!

40:36.393 --> 40:37.758
(EXPLOSION)

40:49.615 --> 40:50.650
(DOOR OPENS)

41:00.584 --> 41:02.040
She's awake.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.242
How?

41:04.796 --> 41:06.707
I warned you.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.175
Never underestimate
my girls.

41:10.510 --> 41:11.966
I wasted a lifetime
doing that.

41:13.847 --> 41:14.836
Go.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.507
THE LADY:
She’ll never escape.

41:18.602 --> 41:21.890
/ already have
the whole city hunting her.

41:24.483 --> 41:27.316
Where are
they all coming from?
Why are they after us?

41:27.402 --> 41:28.482
Take this.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.435
I can't do this
without you, Zeph.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.781
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:32.574 --> 41:33.563
Zeph.

41:33.659 --> 41:36.571
In real life,
you're notjust smart.
You're a badass.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.744
And I need you
to believe that, okay?

41:39.039 --> 41:40.279
MAN: Down there!

41:46.088 --> 41:48.044
(GASPS) I am a badass!

41:49.341 --> 41:50.330
No! (GROANS)

41:52.010 --> 41:54.626
Zeph!
I'm so sorry!

41:54.721 --> 41:56.962
THE LADY:
You can’t help her
from up here,

41:57.057 --> 42:00.174
and she has no one
down there.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.262
(GROANS)

42:07.234 --> 42:08.349
DUTCH: Okay.

42:09.069 --> 42:10.605
THE LADY:
She’s all alone now.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.698
Then why are you
so scared of her?

42:23.625 --> 42:24.614
(GROANS)

42:29.047 --> 42:30.503
That's my girl.

42:32.342 --> 42:34.048
Now run, Yala.

42:34.136 --> 42:35.296
Run.
