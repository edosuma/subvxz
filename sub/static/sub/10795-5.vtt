00:01.640 --> 00:03.438
- Do you want a lift?
- I'm OK walking.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.830
Haven't you heard? There's a stranger on the prowl.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.317
This could be very significant for us.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.154
I believe he has had faith at some point in his life.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.277
I'd like to make an appeal.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.877
Is there any way you can stay tonight?

00:22.040 --> 00:26.751
<i>Baby girl Mitchell's off the life support and I wanna see it through with her mother.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:29.516
I spent years interviewing the victims of rape.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.709
<i>I don't think anyone ever felt worse after talking to me about their experiences.</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:37.031
You're wanted, ma'am. It's urgent.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.040 --> 00:48.475
- Paramedics inside?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.632
We're gonna need human scent dogs.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.677
OK, can you call Control and get some human scent dogs here ASAP?

01:07.120 --> 01:09.191
- You should call for back-up, ma'am.
- What?

01:09.360 --> 01:11.591
There was an arrest in this area this morning.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.640
This isn't South Belfast. This could all kick off. I think you should order TSGs.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.917
OK. Do it.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.789
- What's her condition?
- Critical.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.353
- Where did you find her?
- First bedroom, to the left.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.669
Martin, the victim's name is Ann Brawley.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.117
I want you to go with her, try to get a medical opinion of her condition.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.717
Arrange for forensic seizure and take any physical evidence into custody.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.236
Keep your notebook to hand in case she says anything.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.392
Yes, ma'am.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.472
Clear a path for the ambulance, please.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.711
- Get back, ma'am!

02:33.000 --> 02:34.878
- We need support!

02:41.880 --> 02:43.712
- Is it the same guy, ma'am?
- Yes.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.758
But this time he's really fouled up.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.916
- Just... Come on.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.158
Blood's very fresh and there's a lot of it.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.955
It seems he was lying here alive and bleeding for a while at least.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.192
Joseph Brawley.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.395
- But of a different address.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.679
- Gibson. <i>- DC Martin, ma'am. I'm at the hospital.</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:01.797
<i>Ann Brawley remains comatose.</i>

04:02.280 --> 04:05.239
<i>- She's been admitted into intensive care.</i>
- She's still alive.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.392
I'll be there as soon as I can.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.438
Hup.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.478
Oh, hold on.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.313
Keep him in there.

04:23.480 --> 04:27.838
Excuse me, ma'am. It appears the deceased is Ann Brawley's brother.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.398
22 years old.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.078
<i>She suffered a cardiac arrest.</i>

05:21.240 --> 05:23.675
<i>There's pulmonary oedema. There's pharyngeal oedema.</i>

05:23.840 --> 05:26.116
<i>Even if she were conscious she would not be able to talk.</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:30.752
I'm not asking for her to talk. I'm asking for permission for her to be forensically examined.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.311
She's already undergone a large number of medical procedures.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.552
I doubt that there's much of forensic value left on her person.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.792
With great respect, how would you know? You're not a forensic scientist.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.076
Detective Superintendent.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.517
There are indications she was involved in a struggle with her assailant.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.036
We need to see and record her injuries.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.317
She might have his DNA beneath her fingernails.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.073
She might have his DNA in her vagina.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.232
Can I have a word, please?

05:56.160 --> 05:58.629
Look, this is my world.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.794
I know how a doctor's mind works. We need to get permission off the parents.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.317
It's important Dr Manson puts our request to them in the right way.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.072
Let me handle this.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.480
Dr Manson?

06:31.480 --> 06:34.359
Oh. Oh, you frightened me.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.150
- I wasn't expecting you back till morning.
- What are you doing here?

06:39.200 --> 06:43.319
Sally Ann phoned me. She needed to stay at work with a mother whose baby died.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.152
She said you'd be at work all night.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.671
- I don't feel well.
- You've cut your face.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.440
Get dressed and go home.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.592
Why are you angry with me?

06:57.760 --> 07:00.559
I'm not angry with you. I'm angry with Sally.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.837
Leaving the kids in the care of a child.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.395
I'm not a child.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.317
You're not even 16. You're a child.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.076
Do I look like a child to you?

07:34.840 --> 07:39.471
Put on some clothes...and get out of here.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.599
The MRI indicates that there is brain function.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.315
But if she does recover there might be life-long brain damage.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.232
Are you OK?

09:25.120 --> 09:29.717
The older I get the more I have two selves.

09:29.880 --> 09:35.592
The medical self that's confronted every day with the biological basis of existence -

09:35.760 --> 09:38.958
blood, internal organs, corpses.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.398
And then I have another self...

09:43.560 --> 09:47.918
that...bathes my kids, puts them to bed.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.670
Kisses their little cuts and bruises better.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.677
Examining dead bodies is one thing...

09:58.120 --> 10:00.112
Living victims are...

10:01.800 --> 10:03.792
..something else.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.992
There's a name for it.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.272
It's called doubling.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.157
I do the same.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.872
So does the killer.

11:12.360 --> 11:17.515
<i>Basically, I'm looking for a guy or a girl who's up for a bit of fun.</i>

11:18.400 --> 11:23.873
<i>And I mean rough, kinky... no-holds-barred type fun.</i>

11:24.040 --> 11:28.159
- Ma'am. Er...you should see this.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.956
We've downloaded Annie's laptop.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.752
She's on an adult dating site.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.834
Now, some of the profiles are very explicit. Not so much Annie's.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.992
But she has posted a video clip.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.193
<i>Hey, I'm Fiona. Erm...Fi-fi.</i>

11:47.160 --> 11:49.994
<i>I'm 26 and I'm from Belfast.</i>

11:50.160 --> 11:51.799
Her middle name's Fiona and she's 32.

11:51.960 --> 11:56.830
<i>Basically, I'm looking for a guy or a girl who's up for a bit of fun.</i>

11:57.000 --> 12:03.156
<i>And I mean rough, kinky... no-holds-barred type fun.</i>

12:03.960 --> 12:07.556
<i>Erm...I'm looking to be dominated.</i>

12:08.600 --> 12:11.195
<i>And I have erm...a high pain threshold.</i>

12:11.840 --> 12:16.392
<i>I'm not that bothered about appearance so long as you're clean and you know the limits.</i>

12:17.200 --> 12:20.477
<i>If so, send me a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

12:21.800 --> 12:23.792
<i>Bye.</i>

12:25.360 --> 12:27.955
Now there's an invitation to the dance if ever I heard one.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.199
Check every message she ever sent and received.

12:31.360 --> 12:35.400
Get the details of anyone she contacted or who contacted her.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.990
This could be pure fantasy, webcam fun, cybersex and nothing more.

12:40.240 --> 12:45.235
So prioritise any correspondence that even hints at a real meeting in the real world.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.473
And, Jerry...

12:47.640 --> 12:51.998
I'm not interested in judging... just in finding the killer.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.954
Daddy!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.434
Hey.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.592
Hi.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.832
Was everything OK when you got back?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.392
Everything was fine.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.558
Did you pay her?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.712
Pay her? No.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.997
I'm sorry I had to call her. Couldn't get through to you and there was no-one else.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.113
Baby girl Mitchell died.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.358
Oh.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.000
"Oh"?

13:37.160 --> 13:40.119
Mummy, I can't find my necklace.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.272
Well, it has to be somewhere.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.834
- Have the kids had their breakfast?
- Not yet, no.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.390
- Where have you looked?
- Everywhere.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.711
Oh. Come on.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.272
We think we've identified the individual Breedlove referred to

14:05.440 --> 14:07.352
on the phone to Aaron Monroe.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.955
He's Serbian. Mirko Tassich.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.192
Runs a high-class escort agency called Elite Nights.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.956
We're looking into the possibility that he took a contract on Olson -

14:18.120 --> 14:21.716
as a result of an unpaid debt relating to drugs or prostitution.

14:22.400 --> 14:28.795
Certainly...we have payments being made into both Olson and Breedlove's bank account

14:28.960 --> 14:31.555
by Aaron Monroe's event management company.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.357
I have a warrant for Aaron Monroe's arrest and search warrants for all of his premises.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.512
It's Alice Monroe's funeral today.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.392
Are you attending, sir?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.398
I am.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.553
And I think we should let the family deal with that...

14:51.040 --> 14:54.272
with the funeral, the wake.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.035
Bring Monroe junior in tomorrow.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.352
Is that an order, sir?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.591
It's something I'd strongly advise.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.029
..<i>cannabis plants with an estimated street value of £20,000</i>

15:16.200 --> 15:19.511
<i>were recovered in searches at two separate addresses.</i>

15:20.440 --> 15:24.354
<i>Police have released CCTV footage of murder victim Sarah Kay.</i>

15:24.520 --> 15:29.515
<i>Miss Kay can be seen here walking through the main gates into the Botanic Gardens in Belfast</i>

15:29.680 --> 15:31.956
<i>towards 2:30 on the Saturday afternoon.</i>

15:33.120 --> 15:36.192
<i>Police are keen to talk to anyone who was in the vicinity of the park</i>

15:36.360 --> 15:38.158
<i>during those hours on Saturday.</i>

15:38.320 --> 15:41.233
<i>They've also released footage taken from the CCTV cameras...</i>

15:41.400 --> 15:44.279
Mummy, Mummy! I'm on television.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.909
<i>..in their inquiries. The incident room num...</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:50.158
- Get off the phone.
- Huh?

15:50.320 --> 15:53.199
- What you doing?
- There's been a change of plan.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.033
What do you mean?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.590
I've just received an urgent call. You have to go.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.559
- You wanted me here, pay my respects.
- You have no respect.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.792
- Least of all for your ex-wife.
- Oh, Jesus, not again.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.918
Listen. The only good thing you ever did in your entire life was marry that girl.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.356
- And of course you couldn't keep her.
- Dad, please.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.512
Spare me the middle-age fantasies.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.950
What?

16:15.120 --> 16:18.557
You think I didn't notice the way you used to look at Alice? It was so obvious.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.919
Now, you take your tears and you offer the Parkers your heartfelt condolences.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.515
Then go to the east gate - there's a car waiting for you.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.876
- The driver has your travel documents.
- What?

16:33.040 --> 16:34.952
- You're going away.
- Where am I going?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.112
You'll find out.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.595
Assistant Chief Constable Burns is here. Get out of my sight!

16:52.160 --> 16:55.870
- A sad day, Morgan.
- A sad day indeed, Jim.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.157
<i>- They've also released footage taken...</i>
- That could be anyone.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.596
- It's us!
- You need to call them.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.791
Why? I didn't see anything. We were in the Palm House.

17:11.960 --> 17:15.271
You still have to put yourself forward so they can eliminate you.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.271
Eliminate me from what?

17:18.720 --> 17:23.795
Anyone might see this. Colleagues at work, friends, Livvy's friends, parents at school.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.636
If they identify you then the police are gonna come calling - would you prefer that?

17:27.800 --> 17:32.556
<i>..asking anyone recognising themselves or anyone else they know to come forward</i>

17:32.720 --> 17:35.030
<i>and assist the police in their inquiries.</i>

17:35.200 --> 17:37.317
<i>The incident room number will appear on...</i>

17:38.120 --> 17:41.636
If you think the killer represents evil as you suggest here...

17:43.360 --> 17:46.159
..what do you hope to achieve by reaching out to him?

17:48.240 --> 17:51.312
It seems to me evil people are people of a lie.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.279
<i>And they lie to themselves and they lie to others.</i>

17:55.320 --> 17:57.312
<i>If he can take even one right step in life,</i>

17:57.920 --> 18:01.118
<i>it may be more difficult for him to choose evil over good.</i>

18:13.800 --> 18:17.476
<i>The more we make the wrong decisions, the more our hearts harden.</i>

18:18.880 --> 18:23.875
The more we make the right decisions, the more our heart softens.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.312
It comes alive.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.714
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Sally, it's me.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.351
There's something I need to ask you before I go in.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.830
<i>- What?</i>
- Something I need you to do for me.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.360
You can't give out this personal information, Ian.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.920
He needs to be able to contact me.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.436
Trust me, if you give out your personal phone number,

18:48.600 --> 18:50.592
crazies from all over the world will call you up

18:50.760 --> 18:53.673
and say the most disgusting things to you about Sarah.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.560
I suggest using the incident room phone number.

18:56.960 --> 19:01.432
<i>Anyone phoning up claiming to be the killer will have to provide further proof.</i>

19:02.000 --> 19:04.720
<i>And if they can do that then we might think about engaging them</i>

19:04.880 --> 19:08.794
in an apparently private conversation with you.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.994
A conversation that we will monitor carefully.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.632
So, lie to him?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.712
That's the way it has to be.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.631
Why were you in the Botanic Gardens on that afternoon, Mr Spector?

19:35.800 --> 19:40.431
We go there quite often. My daughter likes the Palm House and there's a playground there.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.195
And that's your daughter with you in the CCTV images?

19:43.360 --> 19:45.238
- Yes.
- What's her name?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.596
- Olivia.
- Do you have other children?

19:48.280 --> 19:51.193
A son, Liam. He's five years old.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.400
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a bereavement counsellor.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.870
And where were you on that Saturday night?

19:59.120 --> 20:01.191
I was at home with my wife and children.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.273
- And she'll be able to verify that?
- Yes.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.270
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Is this Mrs Spector? Mrs Sally Ann Spector?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.872
It's Detective Constable Martin.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.430
After the children were in bed, we had supper.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.399
What did you have to eat? Can you remember?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.632
I don't think I can.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.436
And what did you do then? Watch television?

20:43.600 --> 20:46.798
- I think my wife watched some television.
- What did you do?

20:48.720 --> 20:53.511
I had some work to do for the following day. I was in my study, probably with some music on.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.672
Did you use the internet?

20:56.800 --> 20:58.519
- Not that I recall.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.997
There are no records of any antecedents for you in Belfast, Mr Spector. Why is that?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.600
I spent my childhood in various care homes.

21:19.760 --> 21:24.471
Can you write down the names of those care homes and the dates you were there, please.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.437
<i>Where were you last night, Mr Spector?</i>

21:44.240 --> 21:47.756
Last night? Why? What happened last night?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.912
Just answer the question.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.360
My wife was working at the neo-natal unit.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.398
And you?

21:56.560 --> 21:58.279
I was with the children.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.113
All evening and all night?

22:01.480 --> 22:04.712
Fed them, bathed them, put them to bed.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.872
I had an early night myself.

22:19.400 --> 22:24.270
Would you be prepared to allow us to take your fingerprints and a DNA sample,

22:24.440 --> 22:26.352
on a voluntary basis?

22:29.120 --> 22:30.440
Of course.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.792
Follow me.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.998
Sir. Sir.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.512
- Ready?
- This way, please.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.840
Come on.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.512
<i>On the day that Sarah died,</i>

23:21.480 --> 23:25.838
..a part of me and her sister Marion died with her.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.360
Sarah's murder was an act of pure evil.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.471
A loving, talented, innocent young woman...

23:37.400 --> 23:40.359
cruelly and unexpectedly taken away from this world.

23:42.680 --> 23:47.755
Losing a child in any circumstances is a heavy loss to bear.

23:48.480 --> 23:55.114
<i>Losing a child in such a barbaric act of violence without any reason or explanation...</i>

23:56.680 --> 23:58.672
<i>..compounds that grief further.</i>

24:02.680 --> 24:05.275
<i>The killer... wrote to me...</i>

24:07.120 --> 24:11.831
..expressing remorse for the fact...

24:12.400 --> 24:15.711
that my daughter was carrying her first child.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.393
And that's why I want to speak directly to him today.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.872
<i>And offer him my forgiveness.</i>

24:28.440 --> 24:32.400
<i>If...if he will stop what he's doing...</i>

24:34.200 --> 24:40.071
<i>..give himself up... and show genuine remorse and repentance.</i>

24:43.160 --> 24:49.430
Sarah was a person who truly made this world a better place for everyone.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.072
It's all right.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.512
- Come on, now.
- Mr Kay?

25:11.080 --> 25:13.959
I think it best if I continue on behalf of Mr Kay.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.951
Daddy!

25:33.800 --> 25:35.792
Where are the kids?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.952
I asked Mum to take them.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.072
Paul.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.436
Why did I need to lie to the police?

25:48.160 --> 25:50.072
Did you lie to the police?

25:50.240 --> 25:51.560
Yes.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.078
I knew they'd ask me where I was on the night that girl died.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.675
And...?

25:59.360 --> 26:02.398
And I couldn't tell them I was at the suicide helpline.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.834
Because?

26:07.760 --> 26:09.752
Because I wasn't.

26:10.880 --> 26:14.157
Because I haven't worked there for the past three months.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.672
So where have you been...

26:29.120 --> 26:31.271
..when you been all out night?

26:34.320 --> 26:40.112
Sally...I have something terrible to confess.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.672
I've been having an affair.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.912
Who?

26:53.360 --> 26:55.875
- It's over.
- Who?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.232
Katie.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.520
I knew. I knew.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.713
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling her.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.916
Don't do that.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.470
Give me the phone. Give me the fucking phone!

27:16.680 --> 27:19.479
- Sally.
- Get your hands off me.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.519
I'm calling the police and telling them where you really were.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.399
- You can't do that.
- Oh!

27:24.560 --> 27:27.632
I lied for you. I lied to the police for you.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.793
- Sally, she's underage.
- I know.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.952
You sick fuck.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.112
- I'd go to prison.
- Get...

27:35.560 --> 27:38.997
- I'd lose my job.
- Why didn't you think of that before?

27:39.160 --> 27:42.153
Why didn't you think of that before you fucked her!

27:42.320 --> 27:46.997
Sally, they'd put me on a sex offenders' list which will probably cost you yourjob.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.112
You self-serving bastard.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.272
When did all this start?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.992
How did it start?

28:07.360 --> 28:09.352
Online.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.833
I came across some videos she'd posted online.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.072
Videos of her singing.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.995
I posted some comments, we started chatting.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.436
Isn't that called grooming?

28:26.160 --> 28:28.197
I don't know. Yes.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.113
Probably it is.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.278
So, that night when I said, "Paul will walk you home..."

28:34.800 --> 28:37.395
Jesus, how you two must have laughed about me.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.192
We didn't laugh about you.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.399
Have you ever had sex with her here? In my home?

28:47.720 --> 28:49.552
No.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.275
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.752
Olivia saw you.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.392
What?

29:01.680 --> 29:04.673
When I left you here alone she saw you.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.718
That's impossible.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.872
She's said things before.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.118
What things?

29:12.280 --> 29:15.159
About seeing a naked lady... a naked lady in the roof.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.312
That's just a dream.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.272
Poor thing.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.074
Poor thing having you as a father.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.558
If it was Katie, Olivia would have said - said it was her.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.672
Were you here with her last night?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.830
No. No, I was out.

29:39.960 --> 29:44.034
I didn't get back till the early hours of the morning. I didn't know she was going to be here.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.192
When I got back I told her to go.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.714
Where were you? What had you been doing?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.872
I was dealing with a problem at work.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.474
A client of mine who beats his wife has taken against me

29:55.640 --> 29:58.838
because I've helped her get away from him and into a refuge.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.276
Fucked her in the process, no doubt, too.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.115
Sally, I've never been unfaithful to you before.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.796
A 15-year-old. A child.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.072
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

30:14.760 --> 30:17.958
- I'm leaving you.
- Sally, please don't.

30:52.720 --> 30:57.397
<i>Ian Kay broke down today at a press conference and was unable to finish his appeal.</i>

30:57.680 --> 31:01.071
<i>After he left the room, supported by his daughter Marion,</i>

31:01.240 --> 31:04.950
<i>it fell to Detective Superintendent Gibson to continue the appeal.</i>

31:05.120 --> 31:09.911
<i>If the person responsible for the deaths of Fiona Gallagher, Alice Monroe,</i>

31:10.080 --> 31:12.390
<i>Sarah Kay, and Joseph Brawley,</i>

31:12.560 --> 31:19.592
<i>contacts the incident room and is able to prove beyond a doubt that he is who he says he is,</i>

31:19.760 --> 31:25.040
<i>then he will be able to have a one-to-one conversation with me.</i>

32:56.240 --> 32:58.232
I wanted to say sorry for last night.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.518
But I had to tell you to go.

33:00.680 --> 33:06.631
Ever since that night in my study, I've felt very...very drawn to you.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.670
And seeing you like on that stairs... I couldn't cope.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.952
I didn't feel safe being around you.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.034
What are you saying?

33:23.800 --> 33:26.918
I can't see you at the moment. I can't be near you.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.272
I don't trust myself.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.831
I don't trust myself now.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.510
Why?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.952
What do you want to do?

34:07.600 --> 34:10.752
Perhaps...just hold you.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.112
You know, if things were different...

34:31.840 --> 34:36.039
I can't think of anything I'd like to do more than make love to you right now.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.870
That's why we can't see each other for a while.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.317
- That's why you must stay away.
- I don't want to.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.312
You must.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.632
Oh...

36:16.280 --> 36:18.272
Sally.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.317
I always used to come here when I was little.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.952
When things upset me.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.392
It's so peaceful.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.917
- You were lucky.
- Yes, I was.

36:46.320 --> 36:51.315
But if you're asking me to make allowances for your terrible childhood I'm not sure I can.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.032
It's not what I'm asking you.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.079
I've come to ask you, to beg you if necessary, to give me another chance.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.916
I look at you and I don't know who you are.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.312
When you first meet someone...

37:10.320 --> 37:12.676
..when you first get to know them...

37:13.600 --> 37:16.911
...there comes a time when you get to know their friends and their family.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.398
And you get to learn all about them through those others.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.476
Through their closest relationships.

37:26.280 --> 37:31.309
Their mother, father... brothers, sisters.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.912
With you there's nothing.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.554
- I know.
- And I'm really sorry for that.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.437
But it scares me too.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.553
Don't be scared.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.596
I never thought you'd hurt the children.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.992
I never thought you'd hurt me.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.233
I'm sorry.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.710
I was stupid, needy. Stupid.

38:08.520 --> 38:13.117
What needs in you could a 15-year-old meet that I couldn't?

38:14.720 --> 38:16.712
It's a cliché.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.472
Tell me.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.992
Between work and the kids there seemed to be no time for me.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.672
For us.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.792
Do you mean in bed?

38:31.240 --> 38:33.232
I don't know. Maybe.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.273
I've felt the same.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.552
What?

38:52.320 --> 38:54.312
Ahh! Aah...

39:00.360 --> 39:02.352
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

39:03.360 --> 39:05.033
What did you say?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.873
I'm pregnant.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.758
It's OK. It's OK. Don't stop.

39:14.440 --> 39:18.195
Just fuck me. Just fuck me.

39:57.680 --> 40:01.879
What do we do now... now we're having another baby?

40:04.800 --> 40:06.792
I don't know.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.120
You know, growing up, I never thought for a single moment

40:12.280 --> 40:14.840
that I'd have a wife, a family of my own.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.232
And now I've ruined everything.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.351
God, I don't want tonight to end.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.872
What do you mean?

40:31.640 --> 40:33.632
I don't want to face tomorrow.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.038
What if we went away tomorrow?

40:39.200 --> 40:41.192
Where would we go?

40:41.680 --> 40:45.833
That place in Scotland, where we went when you were pregnant the first time.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.992
- We walked on the beach.
- Don't.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.672
You collected all those shells.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.279
- You did those drawings of me.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.472
I can't do this right now.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.992
Please go.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.679
Mary, can you tell me about this drawing?

41:29.080 --> 41:30.673
My eight-year-old.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.755
Apparently, it's me and my husband driving away in the car

41:34.920 --> 41:37.310
and leaving him and his brother behind us.

41:39.960 --> 41:43.158
- Child of a similar age?
- I'd say so.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.752
- But a girl.
- Yes.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.793
You clamped my car illegally.

42:21.760 --> 42:24.912
You think having Jimmy Tyler put away solves your little problem.

42:25.080 --> 42:28.232
I'd like you to release it, please, or I'll call the police.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.598
Something you're keen on, isn't it? Calling the police.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.711
You think we won't find out where Liz is?

42:35.160 --> 42:36.753
Don't know what you're talking about.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.709
You think you can come between a man and his wife and get away with it?

42:49.600 --> 42:53.879
Everything Jimmy said still stands. Watch your back.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.072
Your van's blocking the street.

43:13.520 --> 43:18.072
If he has children do you think he loves them? Do you think he can love?

43:19.320 --> 43:22.757
Most human emotions exist on a kind of continuum.

43:23.760 --> 43:27.754
People talk about lack of empathy. We all have limits to our empathy.

43:27.920 --> 43:33.279
Some people are profoundly moved by children starving on the other side of the world,

43:33.440 --> 43:35.671
and some people it barely touches.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.912
For them things need to literally be closer to home.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.630
Sure, he's way out there on the sex continuum, but...

43:45.040 --> 43:49.956
..we all know men who've fantasised about having a woman completely under their control.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.071
Or initiating the young girl into sex.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.437
Yes, but most don't act on those fantasies.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.560
But he does.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.916
- Why?
- Well, maybe...

44:05.720 --> 44:10.556
Maybe it's not that he's devoid of emotion at all, maybe it's the reverse.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.999
Isn't it emotion that the sexual sadist feeds off?

44:16.560 --> 44:17.994
Blind panic.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.992
Abject terror.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.636
I think he...feels their pain acutely.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.791
It just that he gets pleasure from it.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.112
We have an E-FIT from Rose Stagg.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.432
- Peter?
- Yes, ma'am.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.271
Could he really look like that?

44:48.800 --> 44:52.316
Even a multiple murderer can have his share of good qualities.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.872
<i>Or a pretty face.</i>

46:03.680 --> 46:09.995
Why? It's so unfair. I've only got her and now I have to say goodbye.

46:10.160 --> 46:12.755
- Granny will take her. She needs herjabs.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.718
I don't want anyone to jab her.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.631
Daddy, Mummy's making me leave Belle behind. It's so unfair.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.312
- Why?
- Cos we're going away.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.752
Thank you.

46:42.440 --> 46:44.477
What choice do I have?

46:44.640 --> 46:48.600
Take the kids away from you? Have a new baby on my own?

46:50.320 --> 46:52.755
I've seen what growing up without a father did to you.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.672
Am I supposed to do that to our kids?

46:56.360 --> 46:58.158
You won't regret it.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.276
I'm promising nothing, Paul. Nothing.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.592
I need to call some clients.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.073
Operation Music Man.

48:01.240 --> 48:04.199
I'd like to speak to Detective Superintendent Gibson.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.238
She's not here. Can I take a message?

48:06.400 --> 48:09.040
She said...to call the incident room.

48:09.200 --> 48:11.715
Do you have some information you want to share?

48:13.640 --> 48:16.280
She said she wanted the killer to call the incident room.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.432
<i>So that's what I'm doing.</i>

48:21.920 --> 48:23.752
<i>I want to speak directly to Stella.</i>

48:24.000 --> 48:28.677
I need to ask you some questions first of all to see if you are who you say you are.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.232
What can you can tell me about the crime scene at Hinton Road?

48:35.400 --> 48:37.073
<i>Annie Brawley.</i>

48:37.240 --> 48:40.995
<i>Annie was tied up on the bed, ligatures still in place.</i>

48:41.800 --> 48:44.474
The man was left face down in the hall floor.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.039
Did you take anything from Sarah Kay's house?

48:49.640 --> 48:51.950
<i>- Some items ofjewellery.</i>
- Anything else?

48:52.880 --> 48:54.872
A lock of her hair.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.310
Gibson.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.520
Ma'am. I think we have the killer on the line to the incident room. He wants to talk to you.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.478
Are you tracing the call?

49:07.640 --> 49:09.791
He's talking on an unregistered mobile phone.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.838
<i>Cell triangulation is underway.</i>

49:12.000 --> 49:13.992
- Who's on the call? <i>- DCI Brink.</i>

49:15.560 --> 49:17.552
Put him through as soon as you can.

49:24.520 --> 49:27.080
I tried to execute the warrants on Aaron Monroe today, sir.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.232
- And?
- And he's gone.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.591
- What do you mean?
- Skipped.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.752
Left the country.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.392
Someone must have said something to Morgan Monroe or to Aaron - tipped him off.

49:39.880 --> 49:42.270
Do you have any idea who that might have been, sir?

49:42.440 --> 49:44.318
No, I do not.

49:44.480 --> 49:48.713
And if you think I spoke out of turn to Morgan Monroe...you're mistaken.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.552
You're a weak man, sir.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.192
What did you just say?

50:00.800 --> 50:04.476
Concentrate on finding the individual who pulled that trigger

50:04.640 --> 50:07.951
and shot down one of our police officers in the street!

50:09.920 --> 50:11.912
Is that clear?

50:12.920 --> 50:15.151
Yes, sir.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.312
It's clear.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.195
<i>Hello?</i>

50:35.360 --> 50:38.159
<i>- Who's that?
- Detective Superintendent Gibson.</i>

50:38.320 --> 50:40.312
<i>Stella. At long last.</i>

50:41.760 --> 50:43.240
You wanted to talk to me.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.312
You offered a private conversation.

50:47.040 --> 50:48.554
Yes, I did.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.313
<i>- This isn't private.
- Isn't it?</i>

50:53.120 --> 50:55.237
I need another number I can call you on.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.240
<i>A private number.</i>

50:58.320 --> 51:00.312
<i>A really private number.</i>

51:02.880 --> 51:04.872
I have something to tell you.

51:09.600 --> 51:13.640
<i>07700 900131.</i>

51:14.920 --> 51:16.912
What number is that?

51:17.600 --> 51:20.798
Danni, in my briefcase there's my phone with a recorder.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.234
Has she just given her number to a serial killer?

51:57.560 --> 51:58.710
Hello.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.272
Hello again, Stella.

52:03.920 --> 52:07.436
Now you've got me to yourself, what do you want to say to me?

52:08.840 --> 52:11.992
I liked the red nail varnish. Was that for me?

52:12.800 --> 52:14.792
<i>It was a nice touch.</i>

52:15.920 --> 52:17.912
I'm glad you think so.

52:19.200 --> 52:22.079
<i>- I've been watching you with interest.</i>
- Have you?

52:23.400 --> 52:25.278
We're very alike, you and me.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.432
<i>Oh, I don't think so.</i>

52:27.960 --> 52:29.952
Both driven by a will to power.

52:31.720 --> 52:35.157
A desire to control...everything and everyone.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.352
<i>Obsessive, ruthless.</i>

52:40.800 --> 52:43.076
<i>Living and breathing moral relativism.</i>

52:44.520 --> 52:48.719
It's just you're bound by conventional notions of what's right and wrong.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.920
- And I'm free. <i>- How are you free?</i>

52:53.960 --> 52:58.398
You're a slave to your desires. You have no control at all.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.995
You're weak, impotent.

53:01.640 --> 53:04.633
<i>You think you're some kind of artist, but you're not.</i>

53:05.120 --> 53:07.112
Art is a lie.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.271
Art gives the chaos of the world an order that doesn't exist.

53:11.960 --> 53:16.079
Is that really why you called me? To expound some half-baked philosophy?

53:17.320 --> 53:18.754
I'm disappointed.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.352
I called to say goodbye.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.512
I called to say it's over.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.758
In what sense over?

53:30.360 --> 53:33.273
- I'm walking away. <i>- You can't.</i>

53:35.800 --> 53:37.598
Watch me.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.320
- I am. <i>- Watch me walk away.</i>

53:42.000 --> 53:44.071
It's never over for someone like you.

53:45.040 --> 53:47.680
It won't be over until I stop you.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.039
You had your chance, now it's too late.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.192
<i>You think I'd let you walk away?</i>

53:54.640 --> 53:56.632
<i>You try to dignify what you do.</i>

53:57.440 --> 53:59.591
<i>But it's just misogyny.</i>

54:00.200 --> 54:03.193
Age-old male violence against women.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.031
For Fiona Gallagher, Alice Monroe, Sarah Kay, Annie Brawley,

54:11.200 --> 54:13.112
I won't let you.

54:13.280 --> 54:15.158
<i>You fucked up.</i>

54:15.320 --> 54:17.835
<i>You moved against Annie too soon.</i>

54:18.000 --> 54:20.879
<i>You didn't prepare properly. You didn't do the groundwork.</i>

54:21.040 --> 54:23.032
<i>And you didn't kill her.</i>

54:23.280 --> 54:25.272
You fucked up and we're on to you.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.191
<i>If you're on to me, you'll come for me.</i>

54:30.480 --> 54:33.518
You have no idea who I am and you never will.

54:33.920 --> 54:38.631
<i>I know your name is Peter, or at least you called yourself Peter at one time.</i>

54:38.800 --> 54:43.716
<i>I know that you studied literature at Queen's or possibly Stranmillis.</i>

54:46.240 --> 54:47.117
Wrong.

54:47.280 --> 54:51.832
I think you have at least one child, a girl.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.036
How old would she be now?

54:56.200 --> 54:58.192
<i>Seven or eight?</i>

54:59.400 --> 55:01.392
<i>Does she love her daddy?</i>

55:02.640 --> 55:04.518
<i>Does she look up to him?</i>

55:04.680 --> 55:08.276
<i>Does she think he's the most important thing in her whole world?</i>

55:09.600 --> 55:11.592
Does she dream about him?

55:14.160 --> 55:17.073
<i>What's going to happen when she finds out who you really are?</i>

55:18.760 --> 55:20.752
<i>What you really do.</i>

55:22.720 --> 55:24.712
<i>It will destroy her.</i>

55:26.600 --> 55:28.592
It will kill her.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.752
I've made the calls.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.432
Sally.

56:04.800 --> 56:08.680
I know what you say is right and I don't deserve another chance.

56:10.160 --> 56:15.838
But I will do everything, everything I can, to make it right.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.874
Only you can save me from myself.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.149
Things are gonna be so different from now on.

57:20.920 --> 57:24.834
<i>I called to say goodbye. I called to say it's over.</i>

57:25.680 --> 57:27.831
<i>In what sense over?</i>

57:28.000 --> 57:30.469
<i>- I'm walking away.
- You can't.</i>

57:30.640 --> 57:32.632
<i>Watch me.</i>

57:33.200 --> 57:36.591
<i>You fucked up. You moved against Annie too soon.</i>

57:37.200 --> 57:40.034
<i>You didn't prepare properly. You didn't do the groundwork.</i>

57:40.200 --> 57:42.192
<i>And you didn't kill her.</i>

57:44.400 --> 57:46.471
?..my ma when I get home

57:46.640 --> 57:49.314
? The boys won't leave the girls alone

57:49.480 --> 57:52.279
? They pulled my hair and stole my comb

57:52.440 --> 57:55.080
? But that's all right till I get home

57:55.240 --> 57:58.074
<i>? She is handsome, she is pretty</i>

57:58.240 --> 58:00.880
<i>? She is the belle from Belfast City</i>

58:01.040 --> 58:03.032
<i>? She is a courting one, two, three</i>

58:03.640 --> 58:05.632
<i>? Please won't you tell me who is she?</i>

58:08.560 --> 58:11.075
? The boys won't leave the girls alone

58:11.240 --> 58:14.074
? They pulled my hair and stole my comb

58:14.240 --> 58:16.755
? But that's all right till I get home

58:16.920 --> 58:20.880
<i>- You fucked up and we're on to you.
- If you're on to me, you'll come for me.</i>

58:21.040 --> 58:23.271
<i>- You have no idea who...</i>

58:23.440 --> 58:25.079
Ma'am.

58:25.240 --> 58:27.960
Annie Brawley has regained consciousness.
