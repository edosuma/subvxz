01:50.110 --> 01:53.375
So, she's a dancer, right?
Broadway, summer stock, all that shit.

01:53.813 --> 01:57.112
Who was telling me, Ginny used
to do a little dancing herself, right?

01:57.183 --> 01:58.650
Taught ballet years ago.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.423
Who's that?
- Nobody, Jersey.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.193
Ralph Cifaretto's crew.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.660
Anyway, I go over to her house one night...

02:12.932 --> 02:15.901
she's dressed like a fucking cat,
like from that show.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.402
Eye makeup, claws, the whole bit.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.168
You okay?

02:27.347 --> 02:28.575
Pardon me a minute.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.929
Donny, right?
- John, how you doing?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.661
What's the matter? Not funny anymore?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.530
Funny?

02:53.806 --> 02:55.569
What's the matter with you?

02:55.642 --> 02:56.666
Please!

02:57.544 --> 02:58.602
Funny?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.445
There's funny!

03:03.116 --> 03:04.640
Whoa, what the fuck?

03:04.984 --> 03:06.679
What'd he do?
- He's a cunt.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.550
A sorry sack of shit.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.354
Come on, let me get you out of here.
- No, please.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.322
Scumbag?

03:16.696 --> 03:18.323
Let me buy you a drink.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.501
What the fuck?

03:45.758 --> 03:47.282
What are you doing still up?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.385
Penny Serenade was on AMC.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.456
John, your coat!

03:51.731 --> 03:53.392
Is that Burberry?

03:53.466 --> 03:55.832
Oh, my God, what happened?
- Nothing.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.437
I tripped.
- You tripped where?

03:58.871 --> 04:01.237
I don't know. The steps by Carmine's.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.104
John, your hand is bleeding.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.569
I used it to break my fall.
Jesus, what is this, the inquisition now?

04:08.514 --> 04:10.277
I had a few cognacs.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.817
Go to sleep.

04:20.692 --> 04:24.254
For tax-deferred growth the annuity's fine,
but if I'm hearing you right...

04:24.330 --> 04:26.298
liquidity's the real concern?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.593
Well, we do occasionally need
ready access to our money.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.538
Honestly, guys,
I'd recommend the life insurance trust.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.077
That, coupled with a growth-oriented
reallocation of your assets.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.977
Including an assortment
of other investment vehicles.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.771
What, like classic cars?

04:42.849 --> 04:45.079
No, stocks, bonds.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.119
I think he's pulling your leg, Brian.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.316
Gotta remember that one.

04:50.757 --> 04:54.352
So, great, we'll open an account,
get the paperwork started.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.260
Brian, look, no offense.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.924
I know we're family,
but let me think about it.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.128
Run it by my accountant.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.430
Ginsberg? He's a CPA,
he's not an investment advisor.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.906
Whatever, he knows about this stuff.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.972
You know what, Carm?
Talk to your accountant. Two heads.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.011
Dad, it's Uncle Sil!

05:15.081 --> 05:17.447
I gotta get that. Say hello to Janelle.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.384
I'll walk you out, Bri.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.218
Hang it up, A.J.!

05:32.098 --> 05:33.122
What happened?

05:50.049 --> 05:51.710
Hey.
- Hey yourself.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.910
What the fuck, John?

05:54.787 --> 05:56.049
I got nothing to say.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.552
You got nothing to say?

05:57.623 --> 05:59.591
That fucking kid is in intensive care.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.553
I thought he worked for Ralph.

06:02.061 --> 06:05.224
And Ralph works for me.
So, I ask you again, what the fuck?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.766
Let it suffice that I know
and Carmine knows...

06:07.834 --> 06:10.234
that foppy cocksucker's holding out on us.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.762
Fernandez Paving,
Ralph's contracting company.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.832
My guy read the receipts
for the waterproofing at the Esplanade.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.537
This fucking Ralph's
more creative than Spielberg.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.975
He's off almost $4,000,
third time in a row now.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.107
We agreed, no looting the job site.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.448
First of all, that hasn't been established.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.013
Second of all, this is how you handle it?

06:34.193 --> 06:35.660
Consider it a message.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.424
He's in Miami.
They got phones there, last time I checked.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.522
He's got a bad history, Tony.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.625
Cute cocksucker could wind up dead.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.163
What are you saying here?

06:52.879 --> 06:55.279
He's a two-faced fucking prick.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.340
I thought Ralph was your friend.
- Right, that's rich.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.043
Did you hear what my 'friend'
said about my wife?

07:01.687 --> 07:03.416
He made a crack about Ginny's weight.

07:03.489 --> 07:07.391
Something about her having
a 90-pound mole on her ass.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.792
Well, that's...

07:15.535 --> 07:16.797
That's deplorable.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.566
Who told you this?

07:19.872 --> 07:23.569
What's important is that it was said.
- If he did say it, I didn't hear it.

07:23.643 --> 07:27.010
'Cause he knows better than to make
a remark like that when I'm around.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.946
She's fighting a weight problem
since the kids were born.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.680
Weight Watchers, Richard Simmons, fasting.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.788
She works very fucking hard.
- You're telling me how hard it is?

07:38.858 --> 07:41.827
It's different for women.
Body image, self-esteem.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.995
I'll tell you, though.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.695
I never had a problem with Ginny's weight.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.866
To me, she's beautiful.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.974
Rubenesque.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.976
That woman is my life.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.216
To think she's being mocked...

08:06.486 --> 08:08.317
All right, look, John...

08:10.223 --> 08:13.590
I'm not gonna sit here and deny
that Ralph can be a fucking asshole.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.094
And that was a horrible thing to say.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.791
But even if it was said, you can't be serious
about him winding up...

08:22.935 --> 08:23.959
you know.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.129
She's the mother of my children.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.105
I know she is, John.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.043
At least hear Ralph out.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.241
How long we go back?

08:34.947 --> 08:36.312
All of us?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.448
The kid last night...

08:39.684 --> 08:41.118
He was laughing.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.153
About this?

08:43.823 --> 08:45.290
I don't know.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.527
All right. You're right.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.858
It's just been sticking in my craw.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.497
So, this kid gonna be okay?

08:59.939 --> 09:02.533
I don't know, he's still unconscious.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.603
My fucking temper.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.903
Is he married, children, anything?

09:06.979 --> 09:08.537
Lives with his mother.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.111
I'll send her something nice.

09:22.194 --> 09:26.563
I'm surprised he didn't call you.
Who knows? Maybe he'll be right back.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.394
One sugar, right?

09:37.143 --> 09:39.873
So, how are things at Casa Del Furio?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.282
The Pakistani, the neighbor.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.651
I want to make my garage into
the guesthouse so my parents can visit.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.219
He says to me, because of the rules,
I cannot do it.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.388
Right, the zoning.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.950
The man who sells me the house,
he says nothing.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.957
As far as I remember...

09:59.432 --> 10:02.629
once title has passed,
you have no legal recourse.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.630
Anyway...

10:05.271 --> 10:08.069
next week,
I make a party for the housewarm.

10:08.307 --> 10:09.934
What a nice idea.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.172
This is my real estate exam.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.077
There's one more prep course I want to take.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.043
So, next Sunday is the party.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.115
We will be there.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.059
Now, here, you see?

10:29.261 --> 10:32.287
'Except in cases of demonstrable fraud...

10:32.398 --> 10:37.267
'transfer of title is binding once the grantee
registers the deed with the county clerk. '

10:40.439 --> 10:43.465
Some people say
college only serves to show grad schools...

10:43.542 --> 10:46.136
who managed to show up
somewhere four years in a row.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.875
But volunteering at the law center
actually allows you to make a difference.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.077
Last year, with our help...

10:52.184 --> 10:55.950
over a half a dozen crack babies
were reunited with their natural mothers...

10:56.088 --> 10:57.988
several of whom are now in recovery.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.782
Eventually, with the help
of ACLU attorneys...

11:00.860 --> 11:03.886
you'll be filing court papers
and helping with legal research.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.200
There's a sign-up sheet
and some fliers if you're interested. Thanks.

11:12.138 --> 11:15.801
That's so true what you said about college
being an audition for grad school.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.673
So much for higher learning.
Living in the moment?

11:20.279 --> 11:23.874
Check out the law center.
There's some really cool people there.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.889
There were 15 guys at the dinner
when Ralph told that joke.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.557
Could be anybody flapping their gums.
- What I don't get is why.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.262
What's the upside of telling Johnny that?

11:39.331 --> 11:42.858
Get in good with New York somehow.
- Loose lips sink ships.

11:42.935 --> 11:46.769
First, John knows about flipping the
property by the Esplanade, now this shit.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.200
How about Patsy?

11:51.410 --> 11:53.970
He's had issues,
maybe he's holding a grudge.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.144
You really think he's that cagey?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.479
Albert, then.
- Wait a minute.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.077
What if Vesuvio's bugged
and the fucking feds told Johnny?

12:02.321 --> 12:04.380
Conspiracy theories now?
- Why not?

12:04.790 --> 12:07.258
Create a little dysentery among the ranks?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.721
First of all, the place is swept once a week.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.629
As for the feds, there's more interesting shit
being talked about in there...

12:13.699 --> 12:15.428
besides Ginny's fat ass.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.063
Sil? The liquor inspector's here.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.976
What do you think?

12:36.889 --> 12:40.086
It's not possible, right?
- Silvio talking to Johnny?

12:42.161 --> 12:43.788
You never know, T.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.470
Jason's always been
a well-adjusted young man.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.570
So why now, Elliot?

12:56.809 --> 13:01.371
Three years at Bard and
suddenly now as a senior, this epic drift?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.471
No focus, no drive.

13:04.183 --> 13:08.415
He's actually talked about dropping out
and joining the forestry service.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.548
Well, some people thrive on solitude.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.659
Senior year.

13:16.262 --> 13:20.756
There's something about the light at the end
of that tunnel that can be very frightening.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.727
Saskia's a senior.
Is she going through any of this?

13:24.436 --> 13:27.769
Sask has always been highly motivated.
Kenahora.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.965
Where's Richard in all this anyway?

13:31.110 --> 13:34.705
Jason barely speaks to him anymore.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.972
Since when?
- Right after the rape.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.716
Jason may be feeling guilty himself, Jen.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.420
He's powerless to avenge you...

13:46.091 --> 13:48.855
and resents his father
for the same shortcomings.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.228
Hey, George Hamilton.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.394
How's the back?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.505
Oh, the masseuse down there, the Del Ray?

14:02.074 --> 14:03.939
Magic fucking fingers.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.944
Tony call?
- On his way.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.077
He know you broke up with his sister?
- No, no.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.878
Not unless she told him.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.349
You know what that crazy bitch was into?
- What?

14:15.421 --> 14:18.447
She wanted to stick a dildo up my ass...

14:18.824 --> 14:20.724
make believe she was pimping me out.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.157
I told her, 'Get the fuck out of here!'

14:24.029 --> 14:26.554
What the fuck?
- The whole family's nuts.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.702
How are you?

14:35.908 --> 14:37.375
How you doing?

14:38.978 --> 14:43.438
Fellas, take this shit to my house.
Open some windows, air the place out.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.344
For you, Florida's finest.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.817
Thanks.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.218
How's Donny K.?

14:56.262 --> 14:58.196
I was just asking them about that.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.828
I gotta get over there, get the full report.

15:02.434 --> 15:05.528
Any idea who's writing
the family gossip column?

15:05.604 --> 15:08.004
You know, funny thing about that...

15:09.041 --> 15:11.032
I don't remember saying
anything about Ginny.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.601
Come on, Ralph. I was sitting right there.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.815
Then maybe I said something. I forget.
There was a lot of wine that night.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.249
What about the land deaI,
Frelinghuysen Avenue?

15:20.319 --> 15:24.221
You forget, and maybe tell him that you,
me and Zellman made all that money?

15:24.290 --> 15:26.258
Did I tell him about it? No.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.691
But I sure as shit ended up paying for it.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.924
When you think about it,
Johnny's got some balls.

15:31.997 --> 15:35.091
Big house, lining his pocket
with our hard-earned cash?

15:35.501 --> 15:38.334
Who's he think's keeping that fat bitch
in Devil Dogs anyway?

15:38.404 --> 15:40.838
Whatever he is,
he's also Carmine's underboss...

15:40.906 --> 15:42.874
so you're gonna fucking placate him.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.707
Oh, what, apologize?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.971
No, you do that, it'll be worse.

15:49.548 --> 15:53.245
Whoever told him this,
it's your word against theirs.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.719
You're highly fucking outraged.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.130
Hello, sweetie. It's your secret admirer.

16:07.199 --> 16:08.188
Is he there?

16:08.267 --> 16:09.791
Oh hi, Ralph, one sec.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.328
John, Ralph Cifaretto!

16:17.276 --> 16:19.244
I'll take it in there.
- Okay, hon.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.848
John, it's me.
- And?

16:25.784 --> 16:28.753
And I'm calling to tell you
how appalled I am.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.982
I just got back, I talked to Tony.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.547
I love Ginny,
I would never say anything like that.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.115
That's not what I heard.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.421
From who, John?

16:37.496 --> 16:40.158
I don't betray confidences.
Are you denying you said it?

16:40.232 --> 16:42.200
Fuck, yes, I'm denying I said it.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.407
I don't believe you.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.104
Just tell me who said this,
I'll put a bullet in their fucking eye!

16:53.178 --> 16:55.043
You're a real weaseI, you know that?

16:59.952 --> 17:01.419
John, please.

17:01.954 --> 17:06.084
Look, last year, when Tony and I had
our thing, that misunderstanding...

17:06.425 --> 17:08.619
you were the voice of reason.

17:09.994 --> 17:12.259
You were the one that told me to apologize.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.299
So, you're apologizing?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.531
If that's what it takes.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.070
Why would you? I thought you didn't say it.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.502
I didn't say it.
- You know something, Ralph?

17:22.574 --> 17:25.542
Not only are you a thief,
you're a Iying fucking prick.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.876
I should've let Tony
chop your head off a year ago.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.187
What did I say? No apology!

17:44.430 --> 17:47.126
I want you to sanction a hit
on Ralph Cifaretto.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.459
What, are you fucking kidding me?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.264
He violated my wife's honor.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.735
Ralph slept with Ginny?

17:54.840 --> 17:55.966
He insulted her.

17:56.041 --> 18:00.375
He made a very insensitive joke about
her body to some friends of ours.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.505
What did he say?
- I have to repeat it?

18:02.648 --> 18:05.845
My word's not good enough?
- Not if you want him clipped over it.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.011
He said...

18:13.559 --> 18:17.518
she was having a 90-pound mole
removed from her ass.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.258
The implication was, her ass is so big...

18:24.336 --> 18:26.930
she could have a mole
that size removed from it.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.700
It's an off-color remark,
it was highly inappropriate.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.677
If you want, I'll demand he's taxed.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.071
But clip him?

18:38.684 --> 18:40.777
Is it all just about money?

18:41.987 --> 18:43.750
I'll crack him good.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.723
I'll ask for $200,000.
- $200,000 for insulting my wife?

18:46.792 --> 18:49.352
What's next, Carmine,
he get to fuck her for $1 million?

18:49.428 --> 18:50.486
He wants to fuck her?

18:50.562 --> 18:53.827
I'm making a point,
I'm talking about my wife's honor here!

18:53.899 --> 18:55.526
My honor!

19:05.744 --> 19:09.145
We depend on this guy.
There are millions of dollars at stake.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.882
We can't afford it, John.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.541
A roomful of guys making fun of my wife...

19:14.620 --> 19:16.918
and you're not gonna let me deal with this?

19:17.623 --> 19:20.421
Not that way. My answer's gotta be no.

19:25.764 --> 19:29.029
I want a sit-down then,
with Ralph the fucking thief.

19:29.601 --> 19:33.002
Get this Fernandez Paving
bullshit dealt with.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.678
He was accused of a crime
of severe immorality.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.546
They actually beat him for it with sticks.

19:52.991 --> 19:56.984
The truth was he had a photograph
of Britney Spears with his belongings.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.961
That's horrible.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.793
Dad?

20:07.839 --> 20:09.636
Thought I was in the wrong place.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.042
What are you doing here?

20:12.678 --> 20:15.272
I was looking for a glass of milk
to dunk these in...

20:15.347 --> 20:17.508
and I thought maybe you could help me out.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.720
Got a meeting in the city later.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.556
Rahimah, this is my dad.
- How you doing?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.388
Hello.
- Want a donut?

20:28.493 --> 20:29.858
No, thanks.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.594
I'll see you later, Meadow.
- Okay.

20:47.779 --> 20:52.409
So, what's this your mother tells me
about you joining the legal aid society?

20:54.052 --> 20:57.044
South Bronx Law Center. I'm volunteering.

20:57.656 --> 21:01.422
They provide free legal counseI
for the indigent and disenfranchised.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.060
And this Rahoomi, she's what,
your first client?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.260
What happened to being a pediatrician?

21:09.434 --> 21:12.562
I thought that was a great field for you,
the way you love kids.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.935
Nothing happened to it.
I can't explore some career options?

21:16.008 --> 21:18.238
Oh, defending farebeaters is a career?

21:18.810 --> 21:21.108
Is that why you came here, to annoy me?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.744
Hey, you wanna help people, that's fine.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.550
That's very noble.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.449
Really, I mean it.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.248
Just don't be a sucker, okay?
A lot of these indigenous types...

21:33.325 --> 21:37.352
they got plenty of money to smoke crack
and gamble and all that shit.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.556
You ought to know.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.090
Oh, I see.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.798
That's what this is?

21:44.870 --> 21:48.567
You're working with minorities now,
to get back at me for being mean to Noel.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.603
God, listen to you.

21:51.677 --> 21:55.010
Believe it or not,
the world doesn't revolve around you.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.222
Come on, let's go to the bookstore.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.956
You probably need a sweatshirt
or something.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.989
Hey, take it easy!

23:07.018 --> 23:08.315
How was the traffic?

23:08.954 --> 23:10.683
Tunnel was a little backed up.

23:10.922 --> 23:13.390
This time of day, G.W., you zip right over.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.888
All right, let's straighten this out.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.260
I talked to the guy over at Fernandez Paving,
the accountant.

23:27.205 --> 23:30.106
Fernandez has been
using this jerk for years.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.609
Anyway, it turns out you're right.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.146
The guy's been adding 50 gallons
of sealant every 1,000 yards.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.273
Excuse me, I can't do this.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.840
What?
- What's wrong?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.045
I can't listen to this bullshit.

23:43.121 --> 23:45.453
I'm trying to explain.
- Fuck you!

23:45.524 --> 23:47.515
John, please.
- Don't fucking 'John' me!

23:47.592 --> 23:50.459
Hey, we're trying to settle this.
- It's not about that.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.661
I'm sorry, Carmine.
I can't be in the same room with this man.

24:06.378 --> 24:09.176
Have you talked to Jason La Penna lately?

24:09.247 --> 24:10.908
Actually, I try not to.

24:11.049 --> 24:14.951
When I came out, he acted all weird.
I can't believe I actually kissed him once.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.085
His mother tells me
he's having a rough time of it.

24:18.156 --> 24:21.125
Jen? Please, I'm sure she's overreacting.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.518
Apparently, he's talked about dropping out.

24:23.595 --> 24:27.326
He's okay, but Jason
is like the clichéd psychiatrist's kid.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.960
Slightest bump in the road, he knows
exactly what to say to get attention.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.942
There any of that crumb cake left?
- Counter.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.648
What's all that?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.621
I'm consolidating some bills.

25:01.399 --> 25:04.527
Maybe you don't care about our future,
Tony, but I do.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.332
Where do you get that I don't care?

25:06.404 --> 25:09.168
I met with your cousin.
- Yeah, you met with Brian.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.641
You sat there eating cake
and making wisecracks.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.575
It's boring to me, okay?

25:20.785 --> 25:22.218
You gonna cry now?

25:26.291 --> 25:29.556
What the hell is wrong with you?
- When you ignore me, Tony...

25:29.628 --> 25:32.153
when you trivialize things
that are important to me...

25:32.230 --> 25:36.030
like this family's financial security,
it makes me feel unloved.

25:36.434 --> 25:39.995
That's your problem right there,
because you equate love with money!

25:40.071 --> 25:42.198
You equate love with money!

26:02.327 --> 26:05.194
Is it safe?
- We each got a new cell phone.

26:05.263 --> 26:08.255
Talk on it once, you toss it.
Totally untraceable.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.365
It's what the Taliban used to do.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.495
Let's get started.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.165
My daughter-in-law's coming here
with the baby later.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.546
Hello?
- Is he there?

26:21.980 --> 26:23.345
Yeah, Ton'.

26:23.848 --> 26:25.281
Okay, you're all set.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.545
Just talk into there.
- Junior?

26:28.687 --> 26:30.052
Who's that? Tony?

26:30.121 --> 26:32.419
Junior, it's Carmine. How you doing?

26:32.490 --> 26:35.084
I'm going to the poorhouse,
that's how I'm doing.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.320
When you had that RICO triaI,
what'd that run you?

26:39.331 --> 26:40.992
A lot.
- Where you going?

26:41.066 --> 26:43.500
I told you, I gotta pick up Sophia.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.273
Junior, can we do this already?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.203
Yeah, right.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.337
Johnny and Ralph Cifaretto, right?

26:56.414 --> 26:59.144
Ralph insulted John's wife?
- That's correct.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.777
Who's on the wire now?
- It's John, Corrado.

27:05.156 --> 27:06.680
So, what did Ralph do exactly?

27:06.758 --> 27:09.488
He made a very hurtful remark,
it's not worth repeating.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.655
It's not important.
Let's just agree it was unkind.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.961
Let's point out, too...

27:15.033 --> 27:17.160
that it's only been alleged
something was said.

27:17.235 --> 27:21.865
He 'allegedly' said what he said
to a group of people, friends of ours.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.335
If you weren't there,
how do you know it's true?

27:24.409 --> 27:28.072
I'm not at liberty to say.
- All due respect, but this is bullshit.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.307
Somebody in my family's
talking out of school...

27:30.382 --> 27:33.874
and you're not at liberty to say who?
I should be making the beef here.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.476
My nephew's right.

27:35.553 --> 27:39.512
Let's stick to the issue.
A horrible insult was made against Ginny.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.424
End of fucking story.
- What does he want done about it?

27:42.494 --> 27:45.258
I want to avenge her honor,
as is my right to do.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.820
All right, fine.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.058
You tell me who told you about it,
we'll bring him in here.

27:50.135 --> 27:53.798
He corroborates what you're saying,
I'll give you Ralph on a platter.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.611
Is nothing sacred?

28:00.679 --> 28:03.204
I mean, this is my wife
we're talking about here.

28:03.381 --> 28:06.282
If this were years ago,
would I even have had to ask?

28:07.752 --> 28:09.947
I mean, what happened to this thing?

28:10.021 --> 28:13.513
For God's sake, we bend more rules
than the Catholic Church.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.058
All right, look.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.594
Let's assume, for the sake of argument...

28:17.662 --> 28:19.994
Ralph said what you think he said.

28:20.965 --> 28:24.264
Is clipping him gonna unring that bell?
- Nobody's getting clipped.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.927
I want satisfaction.

28:26.004 --> 28:29.269
Will you accept an apology?
- That ship has sailed.

28:29.474 --> 28:30.941
You're being unreasonable.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.773
Ralph Cifaretto's the only one
who can handle the Esplanade?

28:33.845 --> 28:36.939
Put Pontecorvo in there.
- There are millions of dollars at stake.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.882
Again with the money?
- Yeah, again with the money.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.612
It's settled, John.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.519
So either name a price,
or get the fuck over it.

29:02.974 --> 29:06.137
What would you say
to a piece of Ralph's company?

29:09.447 --> 29:11.541
Just think about it at least.

29:27.398 --> 29:28.456
Hello?

29:28.633 --> 29:31.261
It's me. What, are you still asleep?

29:31.503 --> 29:34.700
No, I was doing something.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.836
I took John to dinner last night.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.073
Ralph's got a big problem, kid.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.578
I thought you squashed it.
- I did.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.772
Problem is,
I don't know if John's hearing me.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.373
What are you gonna do about it?
- Me?

29:46.451 --> 29:47.713
Nothing.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.753
What does that mean?
- I didn't say nothing.

29:51.856 --> 29:54.051
We share the Esplanade, Tony.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.057
I don't want that apple cart upset.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.322
Then somebody
should do something about it.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.193
I appreciate your thoughts.

30:04.903 --> 30:08.566
You saying what I think you're saying?
- I didn't say nothing.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.144
All right then, I'll talk to you.

30:20.285 --> 30:23.982
Twenty years, I've been friends with John.
Now he's gotta go.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.122
All over a stupid joke.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.869
I was fucking around. For Christ's sakes!

30:40.705 --> 30:42.969
You've never made a joke
about Ginny Sack?

30:43.041 --> 30:44.633
Not like that.
- Of course not.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.973
Fuck him and his highfalutin bullshit.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.275
Who does he think he is, Sir Walter Raleigh?

30:49.347 --> 30:52.248
That's enough of you
and your stupid fucking remarks!

30:52.317 --> 30:56.117
Go back to Miami and play volleyball,
whatever the fuck you do down there...

30:56.187 --> 30:58.587
while we clean up your fucking mess!

30:58.790 --> 31:01.088
Maybe even keep your ass alive.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.933
A mole on her ass?

31:16.941 --> 31:18.909
What's the joke? I still don't get it.

31:18.977 --> 31:21.275
It's not a joke, per se, it's...

31:22.180 --> 31:23.841
You had to be there.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.613
Real lack of standards, your generation.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.146
My day, John was right.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.916
A man wouldn't be expected
to stand for such a remark.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.924
Fucked up thing is I don't even like Ralph.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.722
If he was drowning,
I'd throw him a cinderblock.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.490
But not protect one of my own captains?

31:41.366 --> 31:43.596
Besides, it's too late anyway.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.300
Carmine gave me the nod.
- On Johnny?

31:49.841 --> 31:51.968
That one's a slippery fuck.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.534
Him and those big fish-lips of his.

31:56.514 --> 31:57.981
Look at this.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.742
The fifth question
and the poor prick used all his lifelines.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.023
John goes...

32:11.029 --> 32:14.192
Carmine's gonna position himself
for maximum deniability.

32:14.732 --> 32:18.259
So you make it easy for everybody,
take it out of the neighborhood.

32:18.336 --> 32:21.066
What, like an accident?
- Accident, stickup.

32:21.572 --> 32:23.972
He could choke on a chicken wing.

32:24.342 --> 32:27.038
The important thing, Johnny disappears.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.579
With Johnny out,
Carmine's gonna put his son in there.

32:30.648 --> 32:32.445
Fucking Brainless II.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.653
Who knows?
Maybe there's an upside to Johnny going.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.863
He goes to Boston a lot, to visit his father.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.792
Could happen up there.

32:50.068 --> 32:53.799
You want my advice?
You'll call Lou Dimaggio.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.633
The Atwell Avenue boys.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.506
What, those sick old fucks in Rhode Island?

32:59.577 --> 33:03.138
They may be old, my little nephew,
but those dogs can still hunt.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.448
My old man used to talk about them...

33:07.285 --> 33:09.082
something to do with drugs.

33:09.253 --> 33:10.447
Heroin.

33:11.356 --> 33:14.621
Back in the '50s,
it was raining cash with that shit.

33:14.692 --> 33:17.752
Dimaggio and his crew never saw a dime.

33:18.262 --> 33:22.164
The guy they worked for, Lenny Caputo,
he didn't believe in it.

33:23.368 --> 33:24.892
For 15 years...

33:24.969 --> 33:28.097
everyone and their mother
was getting rich dealing H.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.166
Everyone except these guys.

33:32.043 --> 33:35.410
They're eking a living doing hits,
running swag.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.348
Anyway, lo and behold, one day...

33:40.284 --> 33:42.809
Lenny gets pinched for heroin trafficking.

33:44.989 --> 33:47.480
It turns out
the cocksucker's been making a fortune...

33:47.558 --> 33:50.425
working with the mulignon,
and not only that...

33:50.495 --> 33:53.362
he's been selling out his own guys
to the feds...

33:53.431 --> 33:56.229
so he can keep his ass out on the street.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.326
Dimaggio and another guy in his crew
did eight years on a murder rap.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.535
So much for loyalty.

34:03.174 --> 34:06.735
You go to Rhode Island,
and whatever you do, don't mention drugs.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.802
Coke, heroin, not even Tylenol.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.440
So, what happened to this Lenny prick?

34:14.619 --> 34:18.110
Lou Dimaggio. His real name is Galina.

34:19.123 --> 34:22.114
They called him Dimaggio
when Lenny and his wife were found...

34:22.193 --> 34:24.592
with their heads bashed in
by a baseball bat.

34:26.531 --> 34:29.795
Anyway, that was Lou,
while he still had his health.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.978
We could do this ourselves. Ninja style.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.011
Father?

34:48.619 --> 34:50.587
We're here to see Lou Dimaggio.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.018
Come in.

35:27.024 --> 35:30.551
Hello. Silvio Dante, we spoke on the phone.

35:33.931 --> 35:36.331
Chris Moltisanti, how you doing?

35:36.601 --> 35:38.796
My name's Chris, too.
- Yeah?

35:39.036 --> 35:40.901
Are you into drugs?
- What?

35:43.908 --> 35:44.897
No.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.677
What do you mean?
- We don't work for drug dealers.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.111
No.
- Of course not.

35:50.915 --> 35:53.440
Want some coffee?
- No thanks.

35:53.618 --> 35:54.744
Rose?

35:54.819 --> 35:57.185
Yeah, Pop?
- More Sanka.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.189
Anyway, this is him.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.462
John Sacrimoni.

36:10.868 --> 36:13.860
He'll be coming up through here,
next few days.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.097
He stays at the Boston Harbor Hotel.

36:18.276 --> 36:20.039
The guy on the left.

36:21.412 --> 36:22.970
It's my birthday, too.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.743
We're having cake later. Carvel.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.727
Chromosomes. Runs in the family.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.532
There was a guy once, Tommy Neri.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.337
Got him coming home
from the track one night.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.871
Caught him good with a tire iron.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.702
When he woke up, I held him down...

36:52.777 --> 36:55.610
while Frank cut his head off with a hacksaw.

36:55.813 --> 36:58.338
Silent as a mouse pissing on cotton.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.782
If you like...

37:01.118 --> 37:04.246
we could arrange
to have that same thing happen again.

37:05.656 --> 37:09.752
I don't know
that we need to be that overstated.

37:10.094 --> 37:12.028
What did you have in mind, then?

37:12.096 --> 37:14.826
Nothing fancy, as long as he disappears.

37:14.932 --> 37:16.524
It's your money.

37:20.271 --> 37:23.172
Yeah, about that. $20,000, we said.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.940
Half up-front.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.278
So, we'll call you, then?

37:39.290 --> 37:41.884
Pop, Father's here.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.586
Would you like some cake?

37:46.664 --> 37:50.191
Actually, we got a long ride back.

38:00.978 --> 38:03.242
Have you seen my sweater, the cable-knit?

38:03.314 --> 38:04.542
The white one?

38:04.715 --> 38:07.047
It shrunk, I put it in the bag for Goodwill.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.348
I told you I was gonna bring it up to Dad.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.389
I'm sorry. It's in the basement,
near the card table.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.519
Hello?
- It's me.

38:19.263 --> 38:22.198
I just hung up with the guy,
Jerry, from Fort Lauderdale.

38:22.266 --> 38:25.326
That guy we're looking for,
he's at the Del Ray Hotel in Miami.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.371
Our friend with the paving problem.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.769
Send someone over there tomorrow
to take care of it then.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.638
Are you sure you want to do this?

38:32.710 --> 38:35.270
I'd feel a lot better with the Pope's blessing.

38:35.346 --> 38:36.643
Just do as you're told.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.579
I'll deal with the fallout.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.209
Who was that, hon?

38:43.087 --> 38:44.213
Nobody.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.956
Plumber for the store.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.123
What's that you're making?
- Fruit salad. You want some?

38:50.194 --> 38:51.889
Low-fat whipped cream.

38:51.962 --> 38:54.430
No. You enjoy it, sweetie.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.290
Why did I have to come?
He's not even home.

39:26.664 --> 39:29.827
Look who's here.
Carmela, Anthony, how you doing?

39:30.101 --> 39:32.797
We were just passing by,
I figured we'd give it a shot.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.168
No, we weren't.
- Come, I show you.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.879
I was working in the yard, clear the weeds.

39:44.348 --> 39:47.340
Next year, I'll grow grapes
for the Falanghina.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.486
Gonna make my own wine.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.051
It's gorgeous, Fur'.

39:53.290 --> 39:56.691
So, that's the garage in question.
Anthony, don't wander off.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.025
But I have to go to the bathroom.
- Just stay put.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.326
We're leaving in five minutes.

40:02.366 --> 40:05.233
You're thinking of making that
an apartment for your parents?

40:05.302 --> 40:07.202
A garage, I don't need it.

40:11.642 --> 40:14.270
One time, back in Naples...

40:15.179 --> 40:18.740
I work in the garden
as a landscaper for a very rich man.

40:19.683 --> 40:23.175
Just me, I work there alone, growing olives.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.687
My hands in the dirt... the hot sun.

40:31.695 --> 40:35.495
I was never so happy in my life
as when I work at that place.

40:37.101 --> 40:40.264
Sometimes, I get the smell of olives...

40:40.671 --> 40:42.901
in a restaurant, in the store maybe.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.641
It makes me very sad.

41:02.927 --> 41:06.829
You know, I'm not sure,
but I think if it was built before 1938...

41:06.897 --> 41:09.092
you can apply for a zoning variance.

41:09.166 --> 41:12.863
'Pre-existing, non-conforming structure,'
I think it's called.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.674
I just got it back from the Martinizing.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.644
They do a nice job over there.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.841
Say hi to Dad for me.

41:27.918 --> 41:31.354
I put Allegra's graduation picture
in a frame for him.

41:31.889 --> 41:33.652
Love you.
- I love you, too.

41:34.525 --> 41:36.049
Careful driving.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.108
Shit.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.287
It's me.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.484
Hello?

42:47.064 --> 42:49.032
Why is the door unlocked?

43:09.787 --> 43:12.017
Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.

43:12.089 --> 43:14.216
What are you doing?
- I thought you left.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.088
I forgot the sweater.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.755
What are you doing on the floor?
- Nothing.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.990
I was getting the laundry together.

43:34.311 --> 43:36.871
What the hell's this?
I thought you're on the Atkins.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.745
I was! I am! It's hard, John! I'm trying!

43:43.120 --> 43:44.849
This is how you try?

43:45.589 --> 43:47.853
I'm not out of the house 10 minutes!

43:47.925 --> 43:50.120
I was dizzy, I was having low blood sugar.

43:50.194 --> 43:51.752
What happened to the fruit salad?

43:51.829 --> 43:53.922
You were supposed to quit smoking
and didn't!

43:53.998 --> 43:55.795
Nicotine's an addictive substance!

43:55.866 --> 43:58.164
What's wrong with you?
Why are you yelling at me?

43:58.235 --> 44:01.671
Did I ever ask you to go on a diet?
Did I ask you to be thin for me?

44:01.739 --> 44:05.732
The fasting, the NutriSystems,
those goddamn DeaI-A-Meal cards?

44:06.210 --> 44:08.804
It's the world, John. Our culture.

44:08.879 --> 44:11.871
Fuck that!
Do you have any idea what you've done?

44:13.217 --> 44:16.084
What do you mean?
- You lied to me! You lied!

44:17.388 --> 44:20.448
I know I've gained weight
these last few years.

44:20.958 --> 44:24.052
I see the other wives,
the way men look at them.

44:24.528 --> 44:26.519
Don't I look at you like that?

44:27.998 --> 44:29.625
Haven't I always?

44:30.834 --> 44:33.769
It was your idea, all this dieting nonsense.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.197
I want you to be proud of me.

44:36.974 --> 44:38.373
I am proud of you.

44:41.478 --> 44:42.638
I love you.

44:50.487 --> 44:52.546
Welcome to the Del Ray Hotel.
- Thank you.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.284
Can I get your bags?

44:55.459 --> 44:58.394
Go on into the lobby. I'll meet you inside.

45:16.447 --> 45:17.471
Hello?

45:17.548 --> 45:21.177
Listen, it's me. I just talked to my guy again,
we're calling it off.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.784
I'm already out here, though.
Like right there.

45:23.854 --> 45:26.948
We'll work something out, then.
Don't worry about it.

45:29.793 --> 45:32.125
I want half.
- All right, whatever.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.295
Getting out?

45:34.865 --> 45:35.854
No.

46:03.794 --> 46:05.762
What's your fucking problem?

46:16.640 --> 46:19.871
I love the pine flooring.
- I know, it's so rustic.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.023
This is pretty cool. It's actually from Italy.

46:38.428 --> 46:40.760
I'm so bored, I feel like crying.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.268
It's adorable, Furio, really.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.477
I'm gonna be leaving soon.
- Come on.

46:57.981 --> 47:00.074
Stick around. Have some food.

47:00.450 --> 47:02.611
Anything from our friends up north?

47:02.886 --> 47:05.411
Carmine called. Johnny's still in town.

47:07.157 --> 47:08.283
I'm not kidding.

47:08.358 --> 47:11.191
There's tons of toys in there
he said you could have.

47:11.261 --> 47:13.092
They're back behind those boxes.

47:13.163 --> 47:15.597
Bullshit, you're gonna lock me in.

47:15.766 --> 47:17.063
Okay, fine.

47:17.401 --> 47:20.962
But don't say I didn't tell you.
He gets them from Italy.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.700
His father owns a steamship company.

47:26.977 --> 47:29.605
Okay.
- Go ahead, I'll get the flashlight.

47:32.182 --> 47:35.242
Help! Let me out of here!

47:40.357 --> 47:42.348
Gabriella, come.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.755
Come on, dance.

47:54.571 --> 47:58.439
Silvio, you tell her, she can't wear
fancy shoes and no dance, come on.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.534
Shake it up a little.
- No.

48:03.213 --> 48:06.705
Come on, Dad, dance with me.
- No, thanks.

48:06.783 --> 48:08.580
Tommy Tune over there.

48:14.358 --> 48:16.349
Carmela. You come, too.

48:16.426 --> 48:18.758
Yeah, Carm, go ahead, good idea.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.794
You watch me, you do the same.
Everybody, come on.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.109
Everybody, come on.

48:36.346 --> 48:38.780
That's it.
- God, I'm so bad.

48:39.016 --> 48:40.813
No, you're good, come.

49:37.174 --> 49:40.473
At least it's not just Jason who's regressing.

49:40.544 --> 49:44.640
Soprano? His own daughter
was going through the same thing.

49:45.515 --> 49:48.643
I felt like such a fraud giving him advice.

49:49.519 --> 49:52.352
My own son
has three years on his daughter...

49:53.090 --> 49:55.024
and look how he's acting.

49:57.961 --> 50:00.395
Jen, why do you still feel guilty?

50:00.497 --> 50:02.294
Sometimes I wonder...

50:03.967 --> 50:05.730
if Richard had a point.

50:06.136 --> 50:10.038
I shouldn't have gone down into that garage
that late at night.

50:12.609 --> 50:15.578
I went to see Sask at school the other day...

50:15.846 --> 50:18.371
and I'm in the parking garage over there.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.343
I was driving around for 20 minutes...

50:20.417 --> 50:24.376
when finally I spot someone leaving,
this big, Bluto sort of guy.

50:25.255 --> 50:28.349
I must have crowded him
as he headed for his car.

50:28.425 --> 50:30.791
Anyway, he turned around...

50:30.861 --> 50:33.022
and became quite confrontational.

50:34.231 --> 50:37.291
And for a second,
I'll admit, I thought of you.

50:38.201 --> 50:39.964
What are you getting at?

50:41.038 --> 50:44.940
Parking garages
are not inherently dangerous places.

50:46.109 --> 50:49.237
You cannot blame yourself
for what happened to you.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.574
Turns out this guy
was probably another parent...

50:54.651 --> 50:56.448
or, more likely, a repairman.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.320
But if he had dragged me out of my car
and beaten me up...

51:00.924 --> 51:04.553
would I be saying,
'Gee, I shouldn't have tried to park my car?'

51:07.564 --> 51:12.228
Anyway, enough about him.
Let's get back to you.

51:29.219 --> 51:31.016
You wanted to see me?

51:31.088 --> 51:34.524
You can tell Ralph
I've decided to accept his apology.

51:41.364 --> 51:44.492
You know that kid you pissed on?
Donny K.?

51:45.302 --> 51:48.066
He's got fucking nerve damage
on his left side.

51:49.072 --> 51:50.664
I'm sorry, Tony.

51:54.211 --> 51:55.701
I bet you are.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.804
I'll expect to hear from Ralph, then.

52:01.151 --> 52:03.449
Why the big reversal all of a sudden?

52:05.755 --> 52:07.950
No more weight remarks, Tony.

52:08.225 --> 52:11.217
They're hurtfuI, and they're destructive.

52:12.629 --> 52:13.857
I agree.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.360
Still awake?

52:47.697 --> 52:49.324
I'm just reading.

52:50.967 --> 52:52.764
Bought you something.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.835
What's this for?

52:57.440 --> 52:58.805
No reason.

52:59.442 --> 53:01.740
I don't know if I believe that.

53:11.755 --> 53:14.349
Put a call in to Ginsberg, by the way.

53:14.558 --> 53:16.583
He's back from California.

53:21.464 --> 53:23.432
Tony, this is beautiful.

53:26.536 --> 53:28.060
What size is this?

53:28.138 --> 53:30.834
I don't know, small.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.867
I don't know if this'll fit.

53:34.945 --> 53:36.310
Try it on.

54:03.707 --> 54:06.642
See? I knew you could pull it off.

54:10.447 --> 54:13.416
You look like a model.
- Listen to him now.

55:17.414 --> 55:18.904
I'm sorry, Tony.

55:19.215 --> 55:21.740
What's the matter?
- I can't, the music.

55:22.585 --> 55:24.280
Meadow, turn it off!

55:27.123 --> 55:28.215
What?

55:45.342 --> 55:48.311
The music, will you turn it down, please?

55:56.853 --> 55:58.286
I'm going out.

55:59.305 --> 56:05.731
