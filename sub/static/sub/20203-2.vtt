00:06.440 --> 00:11.011
1953 was a year
of all-American values.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.282
**

00:14.282 --> 00:16.984
"I Love Lucy" was
the number one show

00:16.984 --> 00:19.520
on television.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.389
Dwight Eisenhower
was sworn in

00:21.389 --> 00:23.757
as the country's
34th President.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.460
**

00:26.460 --> 00:29.063
And suburban culture
was a way of life.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.665
**

00:31.665 --> 00:33.301
But under the surface,

00:33.301 --> 00:36.570
society was
as repressed as ever.

00:36.570 --> 00:40.841
It was a very culturally
and sexually conservative time.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.243
**

00:42.243 --> 00:45.679
Men and women were
expected to go to college,

00:45.679 --> 00:49.550
get a job, get married,
settle down, and raise a family.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.386
It was the new American dream,

00:52.386 --> 00:54.788
the white picket fence
out in the suburbs.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.791
And that's exactly the life
that Hefner was living,

00:57.791 --> 01:02.296
but he found it deeply
unsatisfying and boring.

01:02.296 --> 01:06.567
It was clear to me
that America needed a change,

01:06.567 --> 01:09.270
so I decided I was going
to create a magazine

01:09.270 --> 01:11.705
that would challenge
conformity.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.508
**

01:14.508 --> 01:17.945
A modern men's magazine
about lifestyle,

01:17.945 --> 01:22.082
art, culture, and sex,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.686
and I'd call it Stag Party.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.922
But I knew the first issue
needed the perfect cover girl,

01:28.922 --> 01:35.095
and after months of searching,
I had finally found her.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.741
Hey, Hef, I got some more
girls here for you.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.677
- What do you think about that?
- Good.

01:49.677 --> 01:56.150
I have an option myself.
What do you think of
this?

02:03.056 --> 02:07.395
Um... that's Marilyn Monroe.

02:07.395 --> 02:11.899
That's her.
She's our pin-up girl.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.770
In the spring of 1953,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.573
I bought the rights
to nude photos

02:19.573 --> 02:23.311
of one of the most famous
women in the world,

02:23.311 --> 02:25.846
Marilyn Monroe.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.649
**

02:28.649 --> 02:32.653
Now that we had our model,
I worked around the clock,

02:32.653 --> 02:36.324
creating every single aspect
of the magazine...

02:36.324 --> 02:38.592
**

02:38.592 --> 02:44.432
...what would be in it,
how it would look.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.501
He put the first issue out
singlehandedly.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.170
He went over
all the material,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.906
he did some of
the drawings himself.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.944
I was determined to create
the perfect first issue.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.747
There was a section
with party jokes,

02:59.747 --> 03:03.116
another on designs
for the modern office.

03:03.116 --> 03:06.654
We would even publish
classic literature

03:06.654 --> 03:08.389
from some of the most
well known authors

03:08.389 --> 03:11.091
in the world.

03:11.091 --> 03:14.928
The boldest thing Hef
did with the magazine

03:14.928 --> 03:19.032
is that he really
dismantled the idea

03:19.032 --> 03:21.835
of the 1950s masculinity.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.405
In the first issue,
in the editor's letter,

03:24.405 --> 03:27.575
Hef very plainly says,
other men's magazines

03:27.575 --> 03:30.077
focus on hunting
and fishing and sports.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.745
We're not doing any of that.

03:31.745 --> 03:36.450
We're gonna talk about jazz
and cocktails and Picasso.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.789
We'd talk about culture,
but we'd also focus on sex.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.858
**

03:44.858 --> 03:46.827
When people raised questions

03:46.827 --> 03:49.597
about why we included sex
in the magazine,

03:49.597 --> 03:52.165
my response always was,
how could you put together

03:52.165 --> 03:54.067
a men's magazine
and not include

03:54.067 --> 03:56.136
the primary thing
that men are interested in?

03:56.136 --> 04:00.207
The whole idea from the
beginning was to incorporate sex

04:00.207 --> 04:04.745
as one, normal and logical and
healthy part of a total package

04:04.745 --> 04:07.781
that appealed
to a male audience.

04:07.781 --> 04:12.252
We featured articles on modern
dating and married life...

04:12.252 --> 04:14.422
**

04:14.422 --> 04:16.524
and instructions
for how to play

04:16.524 --> 04:18.526
a provocative new party game

04:18.526 --> 04:21.962
called "Strip Quiz."

04:21.962 --> 04:24.332
**

04:24.332 --> 04:28.802
I think that we have it very,
very engrained in our heads

04:28.802 --> 04:31.939
to be very uncomfortable
with sex,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.941
but that's the reason
I'm here.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.443
That's the reason
why you're here.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.878
That's the reason why
we're all here.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.714
My hope was that my magazine

04:40.714 --> 04:44.852
would bring sex
to the mainstream.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.721
**

04:57.465 --> 05:01.802
But just as we were putting the
final touches on the magazine,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.505
everything came
to a standstill.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.478
It turns out,
there was a hunting magazine

05:10.478 --> 05:13.046
already on the market
called Stag,

05:13.046 --> 05:17.451
and as soon as Stag
got wind of Stag Party,

05:17.451 --> 05:21.655
they threatened to sue us
for copyright infringement.

05:21.655 --> 05:26.527
Now, with only a week
before our deadline,

05:26.527 --> 05:29.363
we had to completely
re-edit the magazine

05:29.363 --> 05:33.434
and come up
with a brand new title.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.673
* Every little movement *

05:39.673 --> 05:43.611
* Every little thing
you do *

05:43.611 --> 05:46.346
* Is it sleight of hand *

05:46.346 --> 05:51.619
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

05:51.619 --> 05:55.623
* Every little movement *

05:55.623 --> 05:59.693
* Every
little movement **

06:08.001 --> 06:12.105
Facing a potential lawsuit,
I gathered my staff

06:12.105 --> 06:16.577
to try and come up with
a new name for the magazine.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.778
Bachelor.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.879
Ah, it makes it sound

06:18.879 --> 06:20.213
like we're not
for married men.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.949
We'd be cutting out
a whole reader base.

06:21.949 --> 06:25.419
What about something
like Sir or Gentlemen?

06:25.419 --> 06:26.720
No, no, it's too literal.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.156
It has to be fun.
What does the nameJaguar

06:29.156 --> 06:30.323
have to do
with a car company?

06:30.323 --> 06:32.560
Nothing, but it
sounds cool, right?

06:32.560 --> 06:35.663
Oh, oh! What was the name
of that car company

06:35.663 --> 06:40.100
my mom used to work for?
Playboy.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.038
Playboy.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.308
**

06:48.308 --> 06:53.180
We spent many, many hours
talking about names.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.848
Finally, I remembered
that my mother

06:54.848 --> 06:58.285
had worked for an
automobile company in Detroit

06:58.285 --> 07:00.688
called Playboy Automobile,

07:00.688 --> 07:03.691
and it was a very
sporty looking automobile,

07:03.691 --> 07:06.226
a nice looking automobile,
and that's what made me

07:06.226 --> 07:09.530
mention Playboy
as a possibility.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.700
Playboy. Perfect.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.069
It isn't aggressive.
It isn't hyper-masculine.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.706
Yeah, okay, you're doing
nudie magazines,

07:18.706 --> 07:21.174
but there's
a sophistication to it.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.710
**

07:22.710 --> 07:25.613
We had our new name.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.181
Now we had to quickly
revise the cover

07:28.181 --> 07:30.618
and remove all references
to Stag Party

07:30.618 --> 07:32.886
throughout the magazine.

07:32.886 --> 07:38.959
Back then, when you're literally
pasting print onto a page,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.695
somebody would have to take
a knife, a little X-Acto knife,

07:41.695 --> 07:46.900
and cut out every Stag Party
on every page of the magazine

07:46.900 --> 07:49.737
and replace it with Playboy.
Even today,

07:49.737 --> 07:51.839
with desktop publishing
and all that kind of stuff,

07:51.839 --> 07:55.175
that would be an
incredible amount of work.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.978
**

07:57.978 --> 08:00.413
Even our cartoon mascot
of a deer

08:00.413 --> 08:03.316
would have to change
to something else,

08:03.316 --> 08:05.519
and we chose a bunny.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.854
**

08:06.854 --> 08:09.523
The rabbit captures
the sophistication,

08:09.523 --> 08:11.859
the silliness of the brand.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.596
There is the sort of sexual
connotation of a rabbit

08:15.596 --> 08:17.798
that comes through.

08:17.798 --> 08:22.469
I had no idea at the time,
but that one little change

08:22.469 --> 08:26.039
would come to define
the magazine for decades.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.475
We had our mascot in place,

08:28.475 --> 08:33.446
and with Marilyn on the cover,
we were ready to go.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.082
**

08:35.082 --> 08:38.351
Soon, almost 70,000 copies
of Playboy

08:38.351 --> 08:42.455
would be heading to major
cities across the country.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.825
**

08:44.825 --> 08:48.562
The only question was,
would it sell?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.098
**

08:56.069 --> 09:01.208
In December of 1953,
my magazine hit the newsstands.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.976
Thank you.

09:05.679 --> 09:11.051
Hef got up and lurked
around newsstands in Chicago

09:11.051 --> 09:14.021
and waited to see if anyone
would pick up the copy

09:14.021 --> 09:16.824
and has talked about
how excited he was

09:16.824 --> 09:18.826
the first time
he saw someone buy it.

09:18.826 --> 09:22.996
And I imagine he was
elated to know

09:22.996 --> 09:25.298
there were other people out
there who felt like he did,

09:25.298 --> 09:28.902
because he was taking
this gamble.

09:31.471 --> 09:36.076
I was excited,
but I was also nervous,

09:36.076 --> 09:39.412
so nervous I didn't put
my name or issue number

09:39.412 --> 09:41.615
on our first publication.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.484
**

09:44.484 --> 09:46.219
I felt at the time, even if
there was never going to be

09:46.219 --> 09:49.657
another issue that
I'd had my chance, and indeed,

09:49.657 --> 09:51.759
at that point, I was not sure
there would be a second issue.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.661
That's why it
had no date on it.

09:53.661 --> 09:59.800
Whether I succeeded or not,
I'd had the chance to try.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.638
And then, the numbers came in.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.041
**

10:08.041 --> 10:10.443
In its first two weeks
on the newsstands,

10:10.443 --> 10:15.048
nearly 80% of
the 70, 000 issues we printed

10:15.048 --> 10:18.251
were sold across the country.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.353
* Don't you know
you gotta be strong? *

10:20.353 --> 10:22.890
* Leave all
the other guys alone *

10:22.890 --> 10:25.358
It was virtually sold out.

10:25.358 --> 10:30.063
He edited this magazine for
himself, and he was betting

10:30.063 --> 10:33.200
that other young men
were interested

10:33.200 --> 10:35.803
in the same things he
was interested in,

10:35.803 --> 10:38.271
and he won that bet.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.073
* You're gonna be lonely *

10:40.073 --> 10:41.975
* So let it shine *

10:41.975 --> 10:44.678
It was enough for me to
pay back everyone I owed,

10:44.678 --> 10:46.880
get our furniture back,

10:46.880 --> 10:51.852
and still have enough left over
to replace my 12-year-old Chevy

10:51.852 --> 10:54.688
with a brand-new
Studebaker sports car.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.989
**

10:55.989 --> 10:58.859
"May I congratulate you
on your initial issue

10:58.859 --> 11:00.894
of Playboy magazine."

11:00.894 --> 11:04.264
And it wasn't long before
fan mail started pouring in.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.400
* Don't you know
you gotta be strong? *

11:07.400 --> 11:09.269
* Leave all
the other guys alone *

11:09.269 --> 11:14.407
Readers in Oklahoma,
Colorado, and Illinois

11:14.407 --> 11:18.645
were raving about Marilyn
and the magazine.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.513
* Whoa *

11:20.513 --> 11:23.316
Even the press
gave us positive reviews.

11:23.316 --> 11:27.120
The magazine started from
nothing and was a success

11:27.120 --> 11:28.521
from its very first issue.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.860
It was as if it was
a moment and an event

11:32.860 --> 11:34.561
that was waiting to happen.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.097
**

11:40.067 --> 11:42.202
- Just back to back.
- Good.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.604
Yeah, with a little
explanation and, uh.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.341
We were so surprised
by the magazine's success

11:48.341 --> 11:51.378
that we hadn't even thought
about a second issue,

11:51.378 --> 11:54.782
and now we had only a week
to put one together.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.993
To make our lives easier,
we stuck to what made

12:05.993 --> 12:08.161
the magazine work
the first time,

12:08.161 --> 12:15.468
adding more party jokes,
comics, and literature,

12:15.468 --> 12:19.907
but this time, we were
missing one key component.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.175
**

12:25.578 --> 12:28.916
No. There's nothing
good here.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.884
Well, this is all
we have to choose from,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.252
so one of them
has to be good enough.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.023
I'm sorry, but none
of these girls are right.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.425
None of these girls
are Marilyn, Hef.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
They're just not.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.695
But if you want to
print a second issue,

12:42.695 --> 12:44.264
you need to pick
one of them.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.141
Putting Marilyn Monroe
on the cover

12:54.141 --> 12:57.144
had drawn in readers
for the first issue,

12:57.144 --> 13:02.749
but I knew I wasn't going
to find another Marilyn.

13:02.749 --> 13:10.723
If Playboy was going to last
I had to find another hook,

13:10.723 --> 13:13.160
and that's when it hit me.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.228
* Let the sunshine in *

13:15.228 --> 13:17.230
* Come on right away *

13:17.230 --> 13:21.234
* Let the sunshine in,
brighten up my day *

13:21.234 --> 13:24.137
Remember back
in my college days

13:24.137 --> 13:26.006
when I started a column
in the school magazine

13:26.006 --> 13:27.607
called "Co-Ed of the Month"

13:27.607 --> 13:30.443
that featured
female students?

13:30.443 --> 13:33.613
I realized Playboy
could do the same thing,

13:33.613 --> 13:37.550
only we'd call her
the Playmate of the Month.

13:37.550 --> 13:42.722
I had completely forgotten that
the cover of Shaft Magazine

13:42.722 --> 13:47.094
and the feature inside it was
called the Co-Ed of the Month.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.462
It was a revelation.

13:49.462 --> 13:53.733
* And let the sunshine in,
come on right away *

13:53.733 --> 13:57.104
So, a calendar girl
named Margie Harrison

13:57.104 --> 13:58.906
became Miss January.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.910
* Send those clouds away,
let the sunshine in *

14:02.910 --> 14:07.047
Publishing photos
of naked women,

14:07.047 --> 14:08.448
that was nothing new.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.783
It was Hef's personalized
approach to that,

14:10.783 --> 14:12.685
where they
were called Playmates.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.354
This was someone,
your partner in crime.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.656
This was someone
you did things with.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.591
* Girl, you've done me wrong,
that's right *

14:18.591 --> 14:21.694
Was it our best issue? No.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.563
* Yeah, but I really
need you right now *

14:23.563 --> 14:25.132
But I was confident
enough this time

14:25.132 --> 14:27.034
to put my name
and issue number on it.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.868
* Come back to me right now *

14:28.868 --> 14:31.238
* And let the sunshine in *

14:31.238 --> 14:34.307
And believe it or not,
the second issue

14:34.307 --> 14:36.343
outsold the first
by 2,000 copies.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.145
* Brighten up my day *

14:38.145 --> 14:40.180
* Send those clouds away *

14:40.180 --> 14:41.614
* Let the sunshine in *

14:41.614 --> 14:43.616
* Yeah *

14:43.616 --> 14:46.786
Now that our magazine
was a success,

14:46.786 --> 14:50.890
I knew my staff of three
wasn't enough.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.625
**

14:52.625 --> 14:55.028
What do you think
of Playboy?

14:55.028 --> 14:58.631
I think your fiction section
could use a little work.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.068
Oh, really?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.570
When I met Ray Russell,

15:03.570 --> 15:06.806
he was just an unpublished
science fiction writer,

15:06.806 --> 15:10.010
but he'd submitted
a few pieces to the magazine

15:10.010 --> 15:12.745
and I really liked his style.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.949
**

15:15.949 --> 15:17.650
Although his only experience

15:17.650 --> 15:20.020
was writing for
Walgreens circulars,

15:20.020 --> 15:23.423
I made Ray
my associate editor.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.626
My next focus
was the visuals.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.595
**

15:28.595 --> 15:31.031
I had worked with a guy
named Vince Tajiri

15:31.031 --> 15:32.665
during
my publishing house days,

15:32.665 --> 15:36.503
whose talent I felt
was never fully recognized.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.971
**

15:37.971 --> 15:39.439
These days, he was stuck

15:39.439 --> 15:43.376
taking wedding photos
to pay the bills,

15:43.376 --> 15:45.979
so he was more than happy
to accept the position

15:45.979 --> 15:48.381
as Playboy's photo editor.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.616
**

15:49.616 --> 15:52.385
The little magazine
that I had started

15:52.385 --> 15:53.786
with a couple of friends

15:53.786 --> 15:56.990
was suddenly outgrowing
my kitchen table,

15:56.990 --> 15:59.592
so in the spring of 1954,

15:59.592 --> 16:02.862
with the money we had earned
from the first two issues,

16:02.862 --> 16:07.734
Playboy moved
into its own offices.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.238
- Good morning, Mr. Hefner.
- Good morning, Julie.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.705
With our new headquarters...

16:12.705 --> 16:14.141
Eldon.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.608
...my staff was
ready to get to work.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.611
Can I talk to you in
my office? Five minutes?

16:18.611 --> 16:22.549
My dad's success very much
has to do with the fact

16:22.549 --> 16:24.617
that he surrounded himself
with the right people,

16:24.617 --> 16:27.487
and that comes down
to his gut.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.258
His gut allowed him to
figure out who he could trust,

16:31.258 --> 16:35.562
who he couldn't... also to
bring out the best in his team.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.431
**

16:45.538 --> 16:48.075
With our sales growing,

16:48.075 --> 16:51.478
we needed someone to take care
of the subscription requests

16:51.478 --> 16:52.945
that came pouring in.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.682
Hello?
No, of course.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.217
I can do that for you
right now if you like.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.386
So, I hired Charlaine Karalus,

16:59.386 --> 17:01.754
a smart,
determined young woman

17:01.754 --> 17:03.856
with meticulous attention
to detail.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.125
Perfect.
That won't be a problem.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.561
I can get a copy
over to him. Bye.

17:08.561 --> 17:13.300
I had a friend that told me
about Playboy wanting help,

17:13.300 --> 17:17.304
so we decided we would
go for an interview.

17:17.304 --> 17:22.008
Well, we stopped at a newsstand
and we bought the magazine.

17:22.008 --> 17:25.078
She took it real quick
and hid it under her jacket

17:25.078 --> 17:26.679
so no one would see it.

17:26.679 --> 17:30.983
Turned out, my friend
backed out of the interview.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.553
She chickened out
and I didn't.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.390
I had hoped to get
on the ground floor

17:37.390 --> 17:40.493
with this magazine
and grow with them.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.794
**

17:41.794 --> 17:45.165
These various employees
that we're talking about,

17:45.165 --> 17:48.168
one could say
that Hef lucked out

17:48.168 --> 17:52.172
with these guys,
because one never really knows,

17:52.172 --> 17:54.274
but Hefner's gut told him

17:54.274 --> 17:56.843
these were the right people
for the right jobs.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.012
Okay, great, so what's your
turnaround time on that?

18:00.012 --> 18:04.351
I'd assembled a team of
promising, if unproven, talent

18:04.351 --> 18:06.719
but I knew
I needed someone on staff

18:06.719 --> 18:10.157
who could lend a little
credibility to the magazine,

18:10.157 --> 18:14.527
so I hired a guy who had been
an editor at The New Yorker.

18:14.527 --> 18:18.531
His name was
Auguste Comte Spectorsky,

18:18.531 --> 18:23.203
or as we'd soon
call him, Spec.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.537
Hiring Spectorsky

18:24.537 --> 18:26.473
was a brilliant move
on Hefner's part.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.609
Spectorsky gave
the magazine a maturity

18:29.609 --> 18:32.412
it wasn't going to have,
and it's to Hefner's credit

18:32.412 --> 18:37.150
that he understood the magazine
needed that maturity.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.354
**

18:42.722 --> 18:44.391
* Well, rock-a-bye, baby *

18:44.391 --> 18:46.859
I finally had a team in place

18:46.859 --> 18:50.430
and it was time to see
what we could accomplish.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.964
* Rock-a-bye, baby *

18:51.964 --> 18:56.403
* Mama's gonna rock you
by and by *

18:56.403 --> 18:58.104
The staff worked like crazy

18:58.104 --> 18:59.672
to get the magazine
together every month.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.776
* To this little lullaby *

19:03.776 --> 19:05.445
* You don't need
any whiskey *

19:05.445 --> 19:07.414
Day in, day out,

19:07.414 --> 19:10.817
we clocked long hours
and worked weekends.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.788
Playboy was one of
the most exciting places

19:15.788 --> 19:16.889
one could work.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.593
Very different from most
of the other companies

19:20.593 --> 19:24.664
that were around in Chicago
or New York or Los Angeles.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.001
I even bought
a pullout couch for my office

19:29.001 --> 19:30.670
so I could work overnight.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.172
**

19:37.510 --> 19:41.614
I started spending
most of my time at work,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.916
away from my family.

19:43.916 --> 19:48.488
He spent the majority
of his time in that office.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.189
He had a small little bed,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.292
he had a small
little kitchenette,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.327
and he just worked,

19:54.327 --> 20:00.199
and unfortunately, his marriage
suffered from that.

20:02.134 --> 20:05.505
In the marriage, I was
already missing emotionally.

20:05.505 --> 20:10.209
I'm the product of the way
I was raised.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.846
While my father
was absent emotionally,

20:13.846 --> 20:16.182
I was soon absent.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.852
In point of fact,
I wasn't there.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.490
That physical change occurred

20:23.490 --> 20:26.926
because of the success
of the magazine.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.094
It was easier for him

20:28.094 --> 20:31.498
to set up living quarters
somewhere else,

20:31.498 --> 20:34.701
and that's when he said,
"I'm gonna start staying--

20:34.701 --> 20:37.570
living down at the office
a couple of days a week."

20:39.906 --> 20:42.309
**

20:42.309 --> 20:45.878
The team at Playboy
became my other family.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.349
We worked hard,
but we also partied.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.184
And with the magazine's
growing success,

20:52.184 --> 20:56.088
we were getting invited to some
of the best parties in town.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.326
* Let me love you *

20:59.326 --> 21:01.694
And that's where
I was introduced

21:01.694 --> 21:04.564
to a man
named Victor Lownes.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.865
Victor, this is the friend

21:05.865 --> 21:07.367
I was telling you about,
Hugh Hefner.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.201
There you are.
Hi, how are you?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.937
Hef runs the magazine.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.942
Oh, Mr. Playboy.
I like your look.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.209
Nice and casual.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.211
Thank you.
Is this your place?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.548
Yeah, sure is.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.551
When I met Hef,
I thought he was terrific.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.453
Hefner was a very
ambitious businessman,

21:26.453 --> 21:28.254
a very clever businessman.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.723
I mean,
anybody who could start

21:30.723 --> 21:34.727
their own magazine,
I was very impressed.

21:34.727 --> 21:38.831
* If you lend me
your ear... *

21:38.831 --> 21:40.400
It was great
to meet you, Hef,

21:40.400 --> 21:41.868
but I have some
business to attend to.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.570
Um, how about
we grab some drinks

21:43.570 --> 21:45.071
at Walton Walk
on Friday?

21:45.071 --> 21:46.973
Sure.
That sounds good.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.274
Good.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.610
I'll bring along
some friends.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.311
Okay.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.849
For almost a year,

21:56.849 --> 21:59.752
I'd been creating
a magazine called Playboy.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.123
But then one night
at a party,

22:04.123 --> 22:06.092
I actually met one.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.694
**

22:07.694 --> 22:12.765
By 1954, Victor Lownes
was the ultimate bachelor.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.768
He came from a wealthy family
in New York

22:15.768 --> 22:19.539
and was given
anything he wanted.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.775
By the age of 26,
he had moved to Chicago

22:22.775 --> 22:25.177
and was living
the bachelor's dream.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.281
He had the cool apartment,
suave attitude,

22:29.281 --> 22:31.017
and the women.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.921
Victor was leader
of the pack.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.790
Everyone wanted to be
with him, men and women.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.793
He just has this gift of life.

22:40.793 --> 22:44.263
He had great style,
he had great flair.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.699
There was never a dull moment
with Victor Lownes.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.371
I knew Victor could add
something to the magazine,

22:52.371 --> 22:56.142
so I brought him on board
as manager of promotions

22:56.142 --> 22:58.377
and he fit right in.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.983
So, we got two girls, right?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.318
One of 'em puts her leg
across me, right?

23:06.318 --> 23:08.220
Hand underneath.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.123
Victor Lownes played
a great role at the company.

23:11.123 --> 23:16.195
He was something that Hefner
was not-- bold, brash.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.965
He was the complement to Hef,

23:18.965 --> 23:23.402
who was, after all,
a little bit shy and cerebral.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.304
Meanwhile,
I'm at the front, here.

23:25.304 --> 23:28.441
Victor lived the life
most guys dreamed of...

23:28.441 --> 23:30.376
All the way at the front.
Yeah!

23:32.044 --> 23:34.514
...and I wanted
to be a part of it.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.516
**

23:36.516 --> 23:39.719
* She is magic... *

23:39.719 --> 23:40.953
Not even kidding.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.155
No socks, no necktie,
nothing.

23:43.155 --> 23:46.759
I was out with Victor almost
every night of the week.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.861
The guy could get
into any club in Chicago

23:48.861 --> 23:52.965
and always managed to bring
along some incredible company.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.968
I had a very good bond
with Hefner himself.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.270
The two of us worked
late at night

23:58.270 --> 24:01.173
and then we would go out
and have drinks together,

24:01.173 --> 24:05.945
and that became
a regular pattern.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.814
**

24:07.814 --> 24:11.718
Well, we're dancing.

24:11.718 --> 24:15.955
* Fish got to swim
and birds got to fly *

24:15.955 --> 24:17.790
Victor, in some ways,

24:17.790 --> 24:22.495
was more the image
of the editor/publisher

24:22.495 --> 24:24.130
of Playboy than my father was,

24:24.130 --> 24:28.267
because Victor was someone
who loved good food and wine,

24:28.267 --> 24:34.140
who loved to travel, who was
more gregarious and sociable.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.475
**

24:38.578 --> 24:40.747
So, are you gonna ask me
to dance or what?

24:40.747 --> 24:42.815
Oh, of course.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.217
* Tell me he's slow *

24:45.217 --> 24:48.921
Hef really did not
have the example

24:48.921 --> 24:51.123
or the sophistication
growing up

24:51.123 --> 24:55.161
to be what everyone now
thinks of as a playboy.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.496
* Lovin' that man of mine *

24:57.496 --> 25:02.168
It wasn't until his association
with Victor Lownes

25:02.168 --> 25:05.605
that they
almost became a whole.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.808
* He can come home *

25:08.808 --> 25:12.411
* As late as can be *

25:12.411 --> 25:17.984
* Can't help lovin'
that man *

25:17.984 --> 25:22.922
* The way I do *

25:22.922 --> 25:24.591
* Lovin' that man *

25:24.591 --> 25:26.192
Partying with Victor
opened my eyes

25:26.192 --> 25:28.460
to a completely
different world...

25:28.460 --> 25:30.897
**

25:31.998 --> 25:33.566
...and I jumped right in.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.101
* Hey *

25:35.101 --> 25:37.570
**

25:39.572 --> 25:41.173
The beginning of Playboy

25:41.173 --> 25:44.276
introduced me
to a bachelor lifestyle

25:44.276 --> 25:48.114
that has much of the upside
and very few of the downside.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.150
* I want to tell you
a story *

25:51.150 --> 25:52.752
* Every man ought to know *

25:52.752 --> 25:55.121
I felt no guilt
in that context.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.989
I felt that I was exploring
the outer limits

25:56.989 --> 25:59.225
of what it meant
to really be moral.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.327
But the truth of the matter is,
I was running away,

26:01.327 --> 26:06.232
I think,
from my traditional values.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.634
* Hey hey hey *

26:07.634 --> 26:09.401
**

26:09.401 --> 26:12.772
You have to remember,
this was the 1950s.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.206
You were supposed
to get married

26:14.206 --> 26:16.909
and start a family
right after school.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.046
But times were changing.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.114
My father had a sense

26:22.114 --> 26:24.116
that he wanted more
out of life

26:24.116 --> 26:26.753
than he had seen
his father get out of life,

26:26.753 --> 26:28.755
and that a part
of that was the idea

26:28.755 --> 26:30.156
of having a period of time

26:30.156 --> 26:32.324
before you got married
and settled down.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.527
And he got married young,
and I think, too young,

26:35.527 --> 26:37.263
and he would say that.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.698
* Hey *

26:38.698 --> 26:40.366
* Hey hey hey *

26:40.366 --> 26:42.034
As I began spending
more of my time

26:42.034 --> 26:44.336
living the life
of a single man,

26:44.336 --> 26:48.040
I realized it was time to
update the magazine's message.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.976
* Oh work it now,
work that *

26:49.976 --> 26:53.646
When I started Playboy,
it was filled with topics

26:53.646 --> 26:55.181
that met my interests.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.749
* Hey *

26:56.749 --> 26:58.084
* Oh, work it now *

26:58.084 --> 27:01.353
But now I wanted to do more.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.423
I wanted to turn the magazine
into a guide

27:04.423 --> 27:07.326
for how to become
the ultimate playboy.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.898
What is a playboy?

27:14.266 --> 27:16.168
Just toss out a word.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.670
A bachelor.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.772
What else?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.073
Suave.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.474
Sophisticated.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.811
- Intelligent.
- Urbane.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.278
Right.

27:26.278 --> 27:30.216
Every time someone
picks up a copy of Playboy,

27:30.216 --> 27:33.585
I don't want him to just
imagine himself

27:33.585 --> 27:36.388
as the type of guy
who can get the girl he wants.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.925
I want to teach him how.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.760
How to buy
the right suit,

27:40.760 --> 27:42.428
select the right
bottle of wine,

27:42.428 --> 27:45.097
put on the right music
when a girl comes over.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.300
I don't want to
follow trends.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.236
I want to create them.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.439
And that is why
every article, every picture,

27:53.439 --> 27:56.876
every page must be
specifically tailored

27:56.876 --> 28:00.947
to promote this one,
singular vision...

28:00.947 --> 28:04.183
the Playboy lifestyle.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.421
The message was very clear.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.559
We were talking about how
to live as a single male.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.961
And nobody had done that before.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.529
* My sugar is so... *

28:17.529 --> 28:20.499
My staff had
their marching orders,

28:20.499 --> 28:22.368
and we worked
around the clock,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.871
redefining every section
of the magazine

28:24.871 --> 28:28.574
to promote
the Playboy lifestyle.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.409
* She goes to see... *

28:30.409 --> 28:32.644
Tajiri translated
his slick photographic style

28:32.644 --> 28:34.546
into how-to guides...

28:36.282 --> 28:40.686
...teaching our readers to
select the finest in fashion,

28:40.686 --> 28:43.255
mix the perfect cocktail,

28:43.255 --> 28:46.225
outfit the most
cutting-edge bachelor pad

28:46.225 --> 28:50.262
and orchestrate
the perfect date.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.800
* She says "toh-mah-toh"
instead of "toh-may-toh" *

28:53.800 --> 28:56.402
There's a generation
of men who said,

28:56.402 --> 28:58.004
"I'm not gonna marry
the girl down the street

28:58.004 --> 29:00.739
and I'm gonna
move to a major city."

29:00.739 --> 29:03.742
That really shook up America

29:03.742 --> 29:07.113
and I think that bred
the ground for Hef to come out

29:07.113 --> 29:09.782
and invent the idea
of the bachelor.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.884
* We'll be married soon *

29:11.884 --> 29:14.553
I think the thing that made
Playboy so special

29:14.553 --> 29:17.790
was that we managed
to mix the lifestyle

29:17.790 --> 29:19.191
and the sexual content

29:19.191 --> 29:22.094
with a mix of
contemporary values

29:22.094 --> 29:23.595
that were not really
getting expression

29:23.595 --> 29:25.497
in other mass media.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.267
**

29:31.237 --> 29:33.973
Our readership
continued to expand...

29:33.973 --> 29:35.507
Yeah, it's nice,
it's nice.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.543
...and I realized
that we were no longer

29:37.543 --> 29:39.078
just a magazine.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.280
We were becoming a brand.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.517
But there was still
one thing missing.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.720
Playboy needed a logo.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.123
**

29:52.791 --> 29:55.427
So I gave Art Paul
the task of designing it.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.363
**

29:57.363 --> 30:00.499
* Talk to me, baby,
whisper in my ear *

30:00.499 --> 30:02.134
Four minutes later,

30:02.134 --> 30:04.070
he had sketched
the perfect symbol...

30:04.070 --> 30:06.906
* Talk to me, baby,
whisper in my ear *

30:06.906 --> 30:11.077
...an image so flawless
that even 60 years later,

30:11.077 --> 30:12.678
it remains
completely unchanged.

30:12.678 --> 30:15.314
* Don't have no fear *

30:15.314 --> 30:20.019
* Don't you know
I love you so *

30:20.019 --> 30:22.354
The Playboy
rabbit head is iconic.

30:22.354 --> 30:26.725
It is one of a handful
of symbols that,

30:26.725 --> 30:29.695
from very early on, became
phenomenally recognizable.

30:29.695 --> 30:32.831
* Holler hey, hey *

30:32.831 --> 30:34.500
* Kokomo *

30:34.500 --> 30:36.202
**

30:36.202 --> 30:39.939
Our famous mascot
became a part of every issue,

30:39.939 --> 30:42.708
with Art Paul
turning it into a game,

30:42.708 --> 30:44.110
challenging our readers

30:44.110 --> 30:47.479
to find the rabbit
hidden on every cover.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.916
**

30:56.788 --> 31:00.226
* There's dimples
on her elbows *

31:00.226 --> 31:02.494
The best comparison
I have for Hef,

31:02.494 --> 31:04.130
I would say Hefner
is Walt Disney

31:04.130 --> 31:06.032
and the bunny
is his Mickey Mouse.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.134
* Dimples on her knees *

31:08.134 --> 31:10.336
It's branding.
It's marketing. It's brilliance.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.804
* She chills and thrills me *

31:12.804 --> 31:16.042
* With just
a little squeeze **

31:17.876 --> 31:21.547
* I like the sleigh ride,
I like the sleigh ride *

31:21.547 --> 31:25.684
* Jingle bells,
jingle bells *

31:25.684 --> 31:26.818
* Jingle all the way *

31:26.818 --> 31:29.121
Pass these around,
gentlemen.

31:29.121 --> 31:34.493
Looking back, 1954 had been
an incredible year.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.796
The magazine I'd started
with a staff of three

31:37.796 --> 31:42.268
had taken over four floors
of a Chicago office building,

31:42.268 --> 31:45.004
hired over 25 employees,

31:45.004 --> 31:50.509
and grown monthly sales
to nearly 185,000 copies,

31:50.509 --> 31:52.178
more than doubling
the print-run

31:52.178 --> 31:54.646
of our first issue.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.683
It's really remarkable
the magazine was profitable

31:57.683 --> 32:01.287
in its first year.
Nobody does that.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.355
Sports Illustrated,
for a frame of reference,

32:03.355 --> 32:05.657
started about the same time
as Playboy,

32:05.657 --> 32:08.427
and they didn't turn a profit
until the early '60s.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.097
* I like the sleigh ride **

32:12.431 --> 32:14.933
**

32:16.302 --> 32:21.773
* Silent night *

32:21.773 --> 32:26.812
* Holy night *

32:26.812 --> 32:32.384
* All is calm *

32:32.384 --> 32:37.223
* All is bright *

32:37.223 --> 32:42.394
* Round yon virgin *

32:42.394 --> 32:47.699
* Mother and child *

32:47.699 --> 32:50.169
**

32:53.039 --> 32:55.241
My father wasn't
around a lot

32:55.241 --> 32:56.975
when I was growing up.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.881
Putting the magazine first,
which Hef clearly did,

33:02.881 --> 33:05.584
meant, by definition,
that he wasn't gonna have

33:05.584 --> 33:08.220
the same kind of family life
that he would have

33:08.220 --> 33:09.755
if he hadn't done that.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.224
**

33:16.795 --> 33:20.266
He was so busy with the company,
he didn't have a lot of time,

33:20.266 --> 33:22.934
but he was Daddy,
and Daddy was good,

33:22.934 --> 33:25.937
and Daddy was caring.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.540
**

33:28.540 --> 33:31.577
But he was
fairly non-existent.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.046
**

33:35.781 --> 33:39.151
I knew I should have
been home with my family

33:39.151 --> 33:42.454
to be the father
Christie needed,

33:42.454 --> 33:44.690
but there was always
something at the office

33:44.690 --> 33:47.193
that pulled me away.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.196
All right, so you
can see we're going

33:50.196 --> 33:51.763
for a beach theme here.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.999
We're incorporating an image
of the bunny in the sand,

33:53.999 --> 33:56.135
making use
of the bathing suit,

33:56.135 --> 33:57.669
and you can see there's
just a pair of legs

33:57.669 --> 34:00.706
walking into the distance,
suggesting that it may be

34:00.706 --> 34:02.474
her suit that we're seeing,
which of course

34:02.474 --> 34:05.744
would mean that she's not
wearing anything at all.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.651
Uh, it was just an idea.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.653
I can come up with
a couple other options

34:14.653 --> 34:17.356
if you're not happy
with it, Hef.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.426
No, no. It's a good cover.
It's a great cover.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.561
It's better
than the centerfold.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.064
This is inspired.

34:29.868 --> 34:33.004
This is just
awkward, right?

34:33.004 --> 34:35.741
Why don't we take
our own photographs?

34:36.742 --> 34:39.878
Why not?

34:39.878 --> 34:41.680
She has a point.
Why don't we?

34:43.982 --> 34:45.851
See if you can find out
where the calendar companies

34:45.851 --> 34:47.085
are getting their girls from.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.288
Yeah, I'll get on it.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.023
Thank you, everyone.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.660
At the time,
Playboy was using

34:54.660 --> 34:58.029
calendar pictures
for their centerfolds.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.865
They were
professional models,

34:59.865 --> 35:03.435
and they were not
exclusive pictures,

35:03.435 --> 35:07.406
Hefner was very unhappy with
the quality and the caliber.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.242
He wanted something different,
something new,

35:10.242 --> 35:12.311
something unique,
and something, you know,

35:12.311 --> 35:15.381
special that
Playboy would have.

35:16.548 --> 35:20.686
Charlaine, if you
ever have any ideas,

35:20.686 --> 35:22.588
my door's always open.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.823
**

35:35.567 --> 35:39.671
* This time *

35:39.671 --> 35:43.008
Charlaine was a talented,
beautiful woman.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.877
* Can change my mind *

35:45.877 --> 35:48.914
The more we worked together,
the closer we got.

35:48.914 --> 35:53.319
* And keep my heart
from yearning inside *

35:53.319 --> 35:54.820
And it wasn't long

35:54.820 --> 35:57.656
before we became more
than just coworkers.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.826
* Right this time *

36:00.826 --> 36:04.330
**

36:04.330 --> 36:06.632
I'm gonna get a glass of water.
Do you want one?

36:06.632 --> 36:07.966
Sure.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.935
**

36:09.935 --> 36:16.542
* Can't keep my heart
from yearning inside *

36:16.542 --> 36:20.279
* I know love is right *

36:20.279 --> 36:25.517
* This time **

36:39.298 --> 36:41.199
Why are you looking
at me like that?

36:43.101 --> 36:45.304
Have you ever thought about
being in the magazine?

36:45.304 --> 36:48.006
Doing what, exactly?

36:48.006 --> 36:49.641
Miss July.

36:52.077 --> 36:53.545
No, I'm serious.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.549
Wouldn't you like to be
pictured in a magazine?

36:59.318 --> 37:01.353
I'm sure there are
plenty of girls out there

37:01.353 --> 37:03.322
who would be more than happy
to pose for you.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.624
I don't want those girls.
I want you.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.464
Why?

37:13.965 --> 37:16.402
Because you're not the type
of girl you'd expect.

37:20.472 --> 37:24.576
I had sent my team out
looking for the perfect girl.

37:28.179 --> 37:31.317
And I realized she had been
in front of me all along.

37:32.818 --> 37:37.356
I really did the Playmate
picture as sort of a lark.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.024
It seemed like
a fun thing to do.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.560
It was out of loyalty
to the magazine,

37:41.560 --> 37:44.129
and it was just super fun.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.998
**

37:51.703 --> 37:53.204
Charlaine's one condition

37:53.204 --> 37:55.774
was that we didn't
use her real name...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.577
**

37:58.577 --> 38:02.781
...so I came up with an alias,
Janet Pilgrim,

38:02.781 --> 38:06.117
and wrote a short blurb
to go along with the photo,

38:06.117 --> 38:08.454
explaining that she wasn't
like the models

38:08.454 --> 38:10.021
we'd used in the past.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.224
She was plucked
right from our own office,

38:13.224 --> 38:14.893
and to Playboy's readers,

38:14.893 --> 38:18.296
she would simply be
the girl next door.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.333
**

38:28.273 --> 38:29.775
You look great.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.110
**

38:32.110 --> 38:37.649
* If I only had
a second chance *

38:37.649 --> 38:41.920
* How I'd love you *

38:41.920 --> 38:48.994
* If you'll only take a second
chance with your heart *

38:48.994 --> 38:51.797
**

38:51.797 --> 38:56.067
* Darling, this time
I swear *

38:56.067 --> 39:01.306
* At least a lifetime
we'd share *

39:01.306 --> 39:06.812
* No one could
tear our love apart *

39:06.812 --> 39:09.981
* Our love apart *

39:09.981 --> 39:11.983
* If I only had
a second chance... *

39:11.983 --> 39:14.720
When I did my first
Playmate picture,

39:14.720 --> 39:19.257
I was very nervous about it
because I knew hundreds of men

39:19.257 --> 39:23.261
would be opening that magazine
and seeing me like that,

39:23.261 --> 39:26.632
but I wasn't really
showing much of anything.

39:26.632 --> 39:30.101
* Then you'll see *

39:30.101 --> 39:33.004
**

39:39.244 --> 39:43.114
**

39:43.114 --> 39:46.818
With that issue,
our subscription manager

39:46.818 --> 39:50.388
became the magazine's
most popular Playmate yet.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.961
Letters poured in
from across the country,

39:55.961 --> 40:00.666
and I realized
the girl next door...

40:00.666 --> 40:02.400
...was a hit.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.507
That looks great.
Here. You know what?

40:08.507 --> 40:10.141
Just come forward
a little bit.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.746
* Listen to me, baby *

40:14.746 --> 40:18.750
The idea that then
evolved was to use,

40:18.750 --> 40:20.218
when we talk about
the girl next door,

40:20.218 --> 40:22.888
in other words,
to use an office girl

40:22.888 --> 40:24.590
or somebody
going to college

40:24.590 --> 40:27.058
or someone working
as a clerk in a shop.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.761
* Every boy wants a girl *

40:29.761 --> 40:31.262
And what we didn't know

40:31.262 --> 40:34.165
was that it was gonna
cause such a sensation.

40:34.165 --> 40:37.202
* But I've seen lips
bigger to be kissed *

40:37.202 --> 40:39.370
* Stop
I can't stop... *

40:39.370 --> 40:41.439
And it caused
a sensation.

40:41.439 --> 40:48.780
* Lightning striking again *

40:48.780 --> 40:51.983
* Lightning
striking again *

40:51.983 --> 40:55.954
She's not unapproachable.

40:55.954 --> 41:01.760
Hef wanted to capture
the girl-next-door essence

41:01.760 --> 41:06.665
of a flirtiness
but also an approachability.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.266
* I can't stop *

41:08.266 --> 41:11.202
* I can't stop myself
lightning... *

41:11.202 --> 41:14.439
We had gone from the most
famous woman on the planet

41:14.439 --> 41:17.643
to the girls
right there in front of us,

41:17.643 --> 41:20.345
and I knew,
from that moment on,

41:20.345 --> 41:22.681
we were never going back.

41:25.951 --> 41:29.855
* Every little movement *

41:29.855 --> 41:33.959
* Every motion of your hips *

41:33.959 --> 41:37.162
* I feel the compulsion *

41:37.162 --> 41:42.467
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

41:42.467 --> 41:49.975
* Is it a black magic spell
you put me under? *

41:49.975 --> 41:53.679
* This miracle moment *

41:53.679 --> 41:57.883
* Never let it end *

41:57.883 --> 42:01.953
* Every little movement *

42:01.953 --> 42:05.957
* Is beyond
improvement *

42:05.957 --> 42:08.994
* You are the magician *

42:08.994 --> 42:13.865
* I've been wishing
for forever *

42:13.865 --> 42:17.903
* Every little movement *

42:17.903 --> 42:21.039
* Every
little movement **
