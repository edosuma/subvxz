WEBVTT

02:18.679 --> 02:20.822
Not that one.

02:20.824 --> 02:22.709
The next.

03:01.463 --> 03:04.341
How am I to bear it
when you are gone?

03:04.343 --> 03:07.062
I am going only
half a mile, Emma.

03:07.064 --> 03:08.277
But great is
the difference between

03:08.279 --> 03:11.960
a Mrs. Weston half a mile away
and a Miss Taylor in the house.

03:18.584 --> 03:20.151
Dear Emma.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.981
You have been a friend

03:24.983 --> 03:27.797
and companion
such as few possess.

03:27.799 --> 03:29.301
A governess in office, but...

03:30.871 --> 03:33.621
...little short of a mother
in affection.

03:33.623 --> 03:36.789
I wish you every happiness
on your wedding day.

03:42.584 --> 03:44.630
<i>Poor Miss Taylor!</i>

03:47.447 --> 03:50.167
It's a pity Mr. Weston
ever thought of her.

03:52.216 --> 03:54.773
Papa, Mr. Weston is
such a good-humored,

03:54.775 --> 03:56.150
pleasant, excellent man.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.942
He thoroughly deserves
a good wife.

03:57.944 --> 03:59.509
And you would not have had
Miss Taylor

03:59.511 --> 04:00.822
live with us forever
when she might have had

04:00.824 --> 04:02.486
- a house of her own.
- "A house of her own."

04:02.488 --> 04:03.798
Where is the advantage
of a house of her own?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.718
This is...

04:05.720 --> 04:07.576
three times as large.

04:09.335 --> 04:10.485
It's entirely unnecessary.

04:10.487 --> 04:12.245
Poor Miss Taylor.
Poor Isabella.

04:12.247 --> 04:13.877
My sister married
seven years ago, Papa.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.797
You must be
reconciled to it by now.

04:15.799 --> 04:16.727
That was a terrible day.

04:27.064 --> 04:29.397
It shall always be
a matter of great joy to me

04:29.399 --> 04:31.189
that I made the match myself.

04:31.191 --> 04:33.525
Everyone said Mr. Weston
would never marry again,

04:33.527 --> 04:35.285
but I did not believe it.

04:35.287 --> 04:37.845
Emma, you should not make
matches or foretell things.

04:37.847 --> 04:40.245
Whatever you say
always comes to pass.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.230
You must not make any more.

04:42.232 --> 04:45.589
I promise to make none
for myself, Papa.

04:45.591 --> 04:47.702
But I must indeed
for other people.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.486
It is the greatest amusement
in the world.

04:50.488 --> 04:52.598
And after such success,
you know.

05:04.855 --> 05:07.062
Miss Bates. Mrs. Bates.

05:07.064 --> 05:08.789
Miss Gilbert. Mrs. Cox.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.742
Mr. Woodhouse, sir.
Miss Woodhouse.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.720
- Mr. Cole, Mrs. Cole.
- Good morning.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.424
M-Miss Woodhou...

05:23.991 --> 05:25.207
M-Miss Woodhouse.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.926
Morning.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.813
Is this not the most happy...

05:29.815 --> 05:32.054
happy, the-the most fortunate?

05:32.056 --> 05:34.744
This morning, I could not get
my bonnet on for trembling.

05:35.767 --> 05:36.725
Hmm.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.605
Surrounded by blessings.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.453
Wanting for nothing.

05:42.455 --> 05:44.181
I am trembling again.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.351
It is <i>too</i> joyful!

05:49.207 --> 05:50.869
What is it, Emma?

05:50.871 --> 05:53.205
I have a fancy
that Mr. Weston's son

05:53.207 --> 05:54.965
- may surprise us.
- Frank Weston?

05:54.967 --> 05:57.302
He's Frank Churchill now, Papa.

05:57.304 --> 05:58.902
He's his uncle's heir.

05:58.904 --> 06:01.142
When he came of age,
he took his uncle's name.

06:01.144 --> 06:03.349
I so long to meet him.

06:03.351 --> 06:05.269
But how do you know
he might surprise us?

06:05.271 --> 06:07.478
It is his father's wedding day.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.389
Mr. Weston speaks of him
so highly.

06:10.391 --> 06:12.151
I cannot doubt
that he will come.

06:32.119 --> 06:33.496
Poor Miss Taylor.

06:41.751 --> 06:44.150
Dearly beloved friends,

06:44.152 --> 06:47.030
we gather here
in the sight of God

06:47.032 --> 06:51.317
to join together this man
and this woman

06:51.319 --> 06:53.397
in holy matrimony,

06:53.399 --> 06:56.405
an honorable estate
instituted by God

06:56.407 --> 07:00.501
in this time of...
of man's great inno-cence.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.296
"Inno-cence"?

07:03.352 --> 07:05.174
Innocence.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.837
No?

07:06.839 --> 07:08.629
Well...

07:11.896 --> 07:12.791
Mmm.

07:21.047 --> 07:23.287
Mother, you must eat.
It is impolite not to eat.

07:27.831 --> 07:29.078
I was just telling Mrs....

08:35.287 --> 08:37.077
You know what
I'm about to say, sir.

08:37.079 --> 08:39.797
"Why do you keep a carriage
if you never put it out?"

08:39.799 --> 08:42.261
It's just such a shame
to see it standing by.

08:42.263 --> 08:43.925
A gentleman on foot--

08:43.927 --> 08:45.717
- it's unusual.
- Unusual.

08:45.719 --> 08:46.967
Good evening, Mrs. Reynolds.

09:24.472 --> 09:26.133
At last.

09:26.135 --> 09:28.024
Mr. Knightley.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.054
You must have had
a shocking walk.

09:32.056 --> 09:34.549
Not at all, sir.
It's a beautiful evening.

09:34.551 --> 09:36.854
You must have found it
very damp and dirty.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.613
Dirty, sir?

09:38.615 --> 09:40.277
Look at my shoes.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.525
Not a speck on them.

09:41.527 --> 09:43.638
How do you do?

09:43.640 --> 09:45.462
I came to wish you joy.

09:45.464 --> 09:46.742
Joy?

09:46.744 --> 09:48.086
Oh, the wedding.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.133
What a terrible day.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.198
So, how did you all behave?
Who cried the most?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.693
We all behaved charmingly.

09:56.695 --> 09:58.613
Everybody was in
their best looks.

09:58.615 --> 10:01.365
Not a tear, and hardly
a long face to be seen.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.838
Bring the screen
a little closer.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.781
Mr. Knightley feels a chill.

10:05.783 --> 10:07.189
And what of
Mr. Frank Churchill?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.277
Is he every bit as handsome

10:08.279 --> 10:10.456
as his father
promised he would be?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.271
He did not come?

10:21.784 --> 10:23.030
You see, he wished
exceedingly to come,

10:23.032 --> 10:24.854
but his aunt and uncle
could not spare him.

10:24.856 --> 10:27.669
Well, I dare say
he might have come if he could.

10:27.671 --> 10:29.654
I do not know why
you should say so.

10:29.656 --> 10:32.342
If Frank Churchill had wanted
to attend his father's wedding,

10:32.344 --> 10:34.005
he would have contrived it.

10:34.007 --> 10:35.925
He... he chose not to come.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.877
You've never met
Mr. Frank Churchill.

10:37.879 --> 10:40.085
We do not know what he is able
or unable to do.

10:40.087 --> 10:42.933
There is one thing, Emma,
which a man can always do

10:42.935 --> 10:45.045
if he chooses,
and that is his duty.

10:45.047 --> 10:46.934
It is Frank Churchill's <i>duty</i>

10:46.936 --> 10:48.725
to pay this attention
to his father.

10:48.727 --> 10:51.349
He also has a <i>duty</i> to his aunt,
who is unwell.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.269
Mrs. Churchill has been unwell

10:53.271 --> 10:55.382
for as long
as she could say so.

10:55.384 --> 10:57.237
Her nephew is not a doctor.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.414
If he had told her simply
and resolutely that he...

11:01.015 --> 11:03.189
...that he must
attend his father's wedding,

11:03.191 --> 11:05.270
there would have been
no opposition to his going.

11:05.272 --> 11:07.605
You are the worst judge
in the world, Mr. Knightley,

11:07.607 --> 11:09.045
of the difficulties
of dependence.

11:09.047 --> 11:10.902
You've always been
your own master.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.685
You've no idea what it is
to have tempers to manage.

11:13.687 --> 11:16.406
I shall remember that
next time you quarrel with me.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.014
There is a new
parlor boarder, Papa,

11:57.016 --> 11:58.934
at Mrs. Goddard's school.

11:58.936 --> 12:00.501
- Miss Smith.
- There.

12:00.503 --> 12:02.325
Distinctly.

12:02.327 --> 12:03.861
Do you feel it?
A chill draft.

12:03.863 --> 12:05.462
A chill and sickly draft.

12:05.464 --> 12:07.221
She's a natural child.

12:07.223 --> 12:10.005
Nobody knows her parentage,
not even Miss Smith herself.

12:10.007 --> 12:11.863
Is that not mysterious?

12:15.127 --> 12:17.623
Miss Taylor would have felt it.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.558
The misfortune of your birth,
Harriet,

12:53.560 --> 12:56.438
ought to make you particularly
careful as to your associates.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.029
There can be no doubt of your
being a gentleman's daughter.

12:59.031 --> 13:01.173
You must support your claim
to that station

13:01.175 --> 13:03.095
by everything
within your power.

13:04.312 --> 13:06.837
Know you the Martins,
Miss Woodhouse,

13:06.839 --> 13:08.342
of Abbey Mill Farm?

13:08.344 --> 13:10.613
I know that they are
tenant farmers.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.471
They rent their farm
from Mr. Knightley.

13:13.912 --> 13:16.373
They were ever so kind to me
this summer.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.357
Thank you.

13:18.359 --> 13:21.525
When I went away,
Mrs. Martin was so very kind

13:21.527 --> 13:24.247
as to send Mrs. Goddard
a beautiful goose.

13:26.135 --> 13:28.984
The finest goose Mrs. Goddard
had ever seen, she said.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.894
The Martins are of precisely
the order of people

13:35.896 --> 13:38.709
with whom I feel
I can have nothing to do.

13:38.711 --> 13:40.725
A degree or two lower
might interest me.

13:40.727 --> 13:42.902
If they were very poor,
I might hope to be

13:42.904 --> 13:45.206
useful to them
in some way, but...

13:45.208 --> 13:47.702
a farmer can need
none of my help

13:47.704 --> 13:50.327
and is therefore as much above
my notice as he is below it.

13:51.383 --> 13:53.109
Mr. Robert Martin went

13:53.111 --> 13:55.094
three miles one day
to bring me walnuts

13:55.096 --> 13:57.749
because he knew
how fond I was of them.

13:57.751 --> 13:58.934
I believe he's very clever.

13:58.936 --> 14:00.469
He understands everything.

14:00.471 --> 14:02.389
Come.

14:02.391 --> 14:04.982
After tea, we shall call on
my dear Mrs. Weston.

14:04.984 --> 14:07.542
We promised we should be
seeing one another every day.

14:23.032 --> 14:24.918
It was
a beautiful service, Mr. Elton.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.702
I'm not the first
to visit you this morning.

14:27.704 --> 14:30.645
You are no less welcome
for being the second.

14:30.647 --> 14:33.496
Mr. Elton, Miss Harriet Smith.

14:35.384 --> 14:37.430
It is my great honor.

14:40.984 --> 14:43.190
Harriet,
you must sit over there

14:43.192 --> 14:45.110
so that you may admire
the view of Enscombe.

14:45.112 --> 14:47.637
Mr. Frank Churchill
is the artist.

14:47.639 --> 14:48.822
I have heard it described as

14:48.824 --> 14:50.486
one of the finest houses
in Yorkshire.

14:50.488 --> 14:52.277
I have heard the same.

14:52.279 --> 14:55.189
And Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

14:55.191 --> 14:56.405
He is very fortunate.

14:56.407 --> 15:00.245
There is such symmetry
between us.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.805
We both lost our mothers
when we were very young.

15:02.807 --> 15:05.717
And he has his aunt
to care for, as I have Papa.

15:05.719 --> 15:09.557
But how can we admire
a painted beauty

15:09.559 --> 15:14.421
with such... loveliness
before us in the flesh?

15:20.279 --> 15:23.189
Mr. Elton is
such a good-humored man.

15:23.191 --> 15:25.109
So cheerful and obliging.

15:25.111 --> 15:27.062
And gentle.

15:27.064 --> 15:29.751
I think very well of Mr. Elton.

15:31.799 --> 15:33.974
I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse,

15:33.976 --> 15:36.789
that you should not be
going to be married.

15:36.791 --> 15:39.285
So charming as you are.

15:39.287 --> 15:42.582
I have none of the usual
inducements of women to marry.

15:42.584 --> 15:44.373
Fortune I do not want.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.197
Employment I do not want.

15:46.199 --> 15:48.213
Consequence I do not want.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.909
I believe few married women

15:49.911 --> 15:52.085
are half as much mistress
of their husband's house

15:52.087 --> 15:53.655
as I am of Hartfield.

15:56.087 --> 15:57.944
You must come again tomorrow.

15:59.511 --> 16:01.557
Thank you, Miss Woodhouse.

16:01.559 --> 16:02.391
Thank you.

Miss Woodhouse,
which do you prefer?

16:29.624 --> 16:31.542
They are practically identical.

16:31.544 --> 16:36.086
Of course, if the dark
gets dirty, it would not show.

16:36.088 --> 16:38.229
- But the light...
- The dark, then.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.831
The light is
a good deal prettier.

16:44.344 --> 16:46.549
Miss Woodhouse, what's the matter?

16:46.551 --> 16:48.597
Miss Woodhouse.

16:48.599 --> 16:49.653
Miss Woodhouse.

16:49.655 --> 16:50.870
How do you do?

16:50.872 --> 16:52.696
And you, Miss Smith.

16:53.783 --> 16:55.701
I saw you through the window.

16:55.703 --> 16:57.237
I saw you through the window.

16:57.239 --> 16:58.485
Miss Woodhouse,
I bring happy news.

16:58.487 --> 17:00.949
We have had a letter
this very morning

17:00.951 --> 17:02.390
from my niece, Jane Fairfax.

17:02.392 --> 17:04.341
I hope that she is well.

17:04.343 --> 17:07.605
In normal course, she writes
on a Tuesday, but today was...

17:07.607 --> 17:08.918
Oh, her health.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.725
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you are
so very kind to inquire.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.805
Poor Jane. She was at Weymouth

17:14.807 --> 17:16.662
with Colonel Campbell
and, uh...

17:16.664 --> 17:18.389
Oh, where is the letter?

17:18.391 --> 17:21.109
Oh. Oh, it must not be far off.

17:21.111 --> 17:22.550
Oh, such an unexpected...

17:22.552 --> 17:25.013
Oh, it's on the glove stand.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.542
It was with the gloves.
It was with the gloves.

17:27.544 --> 17:30.005
Yes, at Weymouth with Colonel Campbell

17:30.007 --> 17:32.085
and his wife
and Jane's dear friend,

17:32.087 --> 17:34.070
Miss Campbell,
who is recently married.

17:34.072 --> 17:35.925
She's Mrs. Dixon now.

17:35.927 --> 17:37.782
And, oh, dear, Mr. Dixon,

17:37.784 --> 17:39.381
who is the most charming
young man,

17:39.383 --> 17:42.678
rendered to Jane
a great service in recent days.

17:42.680 --> 17:46.005
They were... Oh, too pretty.
That is...

17:46.007 --> 17:50.133
Yes, they were out in a part...
oh, in a party on the water,

17:50.135 --> 17:53.013
and Jane, by the sudden
whirling around

17:53.015 --> 17:55.925
of something or other
in the sails,

17:55.927 --> 17:57.974
would have been dashed
to the sea at once...

17:58.967 --> 18:01.749
...and actually all but gone.

18:01.751 --> 18:05.750
But Mr. Dixon, with
the greatest presence of mind,

18:05.752 --> 18:10.965
caught hold of her habit
and saved her life.

18:10.967 --> 18:14.165
Oh, to think that poor Jane
may have perished.

18:14.167 --> 18:17.942
I cannot think of it
without shaking, she an orphan.

18:17.944 --> 18:20.565
I am very pleased that
Miss Fairfax was not harmed.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.030
How gratified Jane will be
to know that she has

18:23.032 --> 18:25.814
such dear, devoted friends.

18:25.816 --> 18:27.702
Heaven forbid that I should
ever bore anybody

18:27.704 --> 18:29.654
half as much about
all the Knightleys together

18:29.656 --> 18:31.670
as Miss Bates does
about Jane Fairfax.

18:33.367 --> 18:37.077
One is sick of the very name
"Jane Fairfax."

18:37.079 --> 18:39.254
Every letter from her
is read 40 times over.

18:39.256 --> 18:41.270
And if she does but knit
a pair of garters,

18:41.272 --> 18:44.150
one hears of nothing else
for a whole month.

18:46.807 --> 18:48.824
It is Robert Martin.

18:52.247 --> 18:54.103
Good boy.

18:59.543 --> 19:01.205
- Miss Smith.
- Mr. Martin.

19:09.976 --> 19:12.597
- Lovely to see you, Miss Smith.
- Goodbye.

19:17.464 --> 19:20.630
Only think of
our happening to meet him.

19:20.632 --> 19:22.325
Well, Miss Woodhouse?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.405
Is he like what you expected?

19:24.407 --> 19:27.318
What do you think of him?

19:27.320 --> 19:29.877
I had no right to expect much,

19:29.879 --> 19:31.669
and indeed,
I did not expect much,

19:31.671 --> 19:34.998
but I had imagined him,
I confess,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.421
a degree or two nearer...

19:38.423 --> 19:40.311
gentility.

19:41.399 --> 19:43.382
To be sure...

19:43.384 --> 19:47.159
he's not so genteel
as to a real gentleman.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.437
Mm-hmm.

20:00.439 --> 20:03.573
I do hope
Mr. Woodhouse is not ill.

20:03.575 --> 20:05.397
Oh, no.

20:05.399 --> 20:08.534
Oh, Papa sees Mr. Perry
every day.

20:08.536 --> 20:10.454
I know I disappoint him
awfully.

20:10.456 --> 20:12.374
I'm so seldom indisposed.

20:12.376 --> 20:14.294
If he does not invent
an illness for me,

20:14.296 --> 20:15.767
I hardly figure in his letters.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.158
Truly...

20:19.160 --> 20:23.222
you are the very picture
of good health, Miss Woodhouse.

20:23.224 --> 20:25.653
Mrs. Martin thinks you
the most handsome woman

20:25.655 --> 20:28.215
in all of Highbury.

20:31.576 --> 20:33.621
You must never
flatter me in front of

20:33.623 --> 20:35.126
Mr. Knightley, Harriet.

20:35.128 --> 20:37.398
He thinks me
vain enough already.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.893
I do not think you
personally vain.

20:39.895 --> 20:41.174
Considering how
very handsome you are,

20:41.176 --> 20:42.743
you seem little occupied
with it.

20:44.663 --> 20:46.423
Your vanity lies
a different way.

20:54.328 --> 20:57.464
Did I tell you what Mr. Elton
said of you the other day?

21:00.247 --> 21:02.071
He called you...

21:04.247 --> 21:06.198
..."loveliness itself."

21:08.183 --> 21:10.262
It-it seems to me

21:10.264 --> 21:13.461
his manners are rather softer
than they used to be,

21:13.463 --> 21:16.022
and I rather wonder
whether he means

21:16.024 --> 21:18.326
to ingratiate himself with you.

21:24.023 --> 21:25.461
Morning, Mrs. Goddard.

21:25.463 --> 21:27.189
- Good morning, Mr. Elton.
- Girls.

21:28.343 --> 21:30.007
Quickly now.

21:52.791 --> 21:54.645
These are exquisitely done,
Miss Woodhouse.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.661
You have a charming talent.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.773
I dare say
there is merit in them,

21:58.775 --> 22:01.142
in the least finished
perhaps the most.

22:01.144 --> 22:02.742
So Mr. Knightley tells me,

22:02.744 --> 22:04.694
and he finds fault
in everything I do.

22:07.223 --> 22:09.206
Did you ever have
your likeness taken, Harriet?

22:09.208 --> 22:12.053
Oh... no.

22:12.055 --> 22:15.861
What an exquisite possession
a good picture of her would be.

22:15.863 --> 22:17.047
It would indeed.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.669
It would indeed.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.982
Let me entreat you,
Miss Woodhouse.

22:20.984 --> 22:23.637
Now, at once.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.790
You have given Miss Smith...

22:52.792 --> 22:55.670
all that she requires.

22:55.672 --> 22:57.621
She was a beautiful creature
when she came to you,

22:57.623 --> 23:00.245
but the attractions
you have added are

23:00.247 --> 23:03.861
infinitely superior
to what she received from...

23:03.863 --> 23:04.917
nature.

23:04.919 --> 23:05.846
It's depressing for me

23:05.848 --> 23:07.221
- to have to take care of it, you know?
- No.

23:07.223 --> 23:08.246
- Well, quite.
- Take over.

23:08.248 --> 23:09.974
Mr. Woodhouse,
your daughter's gifts

23:09.976 --> 23:12.405
are without compare.

23:12.407 --> 23:14.263
Bear witness.

23:16.792 --> 23:19.191
Mm. You've made her
too tall, Emma.

23:20.824 --> 23:22.197
Uh, no.

23:22.199 --> 23:24.213
No, certainly not too tall.

23:24.215 --> 23:26.165
Not in the least too tall.

23:26.167 --> 23:30.005
Mm, mm, yes.
It is very... pretty.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.862
When it is finished,
you must have it framed.

23:33.304 --> 23:35.222
Allow me.

23:35.224 --> 23:37.782
Trust me with this commission,
Miss Woodhouse,

23:37.784 --> 23:41.269
and I will ride to London
the moment I am asked.

23:41.271 --> 23:42.680
It would be my great honor.

23:46.071 --> 23:48.374
I cannot have a moment's doubt.

23:48.376 --> 23:50.839
It is exactly as I planned.

23:52.216 --> 23:54.104
He's in love with you.

23:57.911 --> 24:00.469
I do not know
what your opinion may be,

24:00.471 --> 24:02.645
Mrs. Weston, of this great...

24:02.647 --> 24:05.269
intimacy between Emma
and Harriet Smith,

24:05.271 --> 24:06.902
but I think it a bad thing.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.565
How differently we feel.

24:08.567 --> 24:11.157
Miss Smith knows nothing
about herself

24:11.159 --> 24:13.336
and looks upon Emma
as knowing everything.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.174
Her ignorance
is hourly flattery.

24:17.176 --> 24:19.062
But educating Harriet
will be an inducement

24:19.064 --> 24:20.757
for Emma to educate herself.

24:20.759 --> 24:21.909
They will read together.

24:21.911 --> 24:23.509
Emma has been meaning
to read more

24:23.511 --> 24:25.461
ever since she was
12 years old.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.062
She never would submit
to anything

24:27.064 --> 24:28.821
requiring industry
and patience.

24:28.823 --> 24:30.453
I cannot allow you to be

24:30.455 --> 24:32.213
a judge in this matter,
Mr. Knightley.

24:32.215 --> 24:34.005
You are so used to live alone,

24:34.007 --> 24:37.302
you do not know the value
of a companion.

24:37.304 --> 24:39.797
Well, she always declares
that she will never marry,

24:39.799 --> 24:42.677
which, of course,
means just nothing at all.

24:42.679 --> 24:44.949
I should like to see
Emma in love

24:44.951 --> 24:47.541
and in some doubt of a return.

24:47.543 --> 24:49.431
It would do her good.

Mr. Knightley, sir,
forgive my liberty,

25:29.879 --> 25:32.056
but may I be so bold
as to seek your advice?

25:33.751 --> 25:35.383
Of course.

25:37.687 --> 25:39.638
Miss Woodhouse!

25:39.640 --> 25:41.462
You will never guess
what has happened.

25:41.464 --> 25:43.415
Robert Martin
has offered me his hand.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.991
He writes as if
he really loves me very much.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.855
Is it a good letter?

25:57.880 --> 25:59.894
Or too short?

25:59.896 --> 26:01.653
It is a very good letter.

26:01.655 --> 26:04.694
So good I think one of his
sisters must have helped him.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.582
But what shall I say?

26:06.584 --> 26:09.173
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
do advise me.

26:09.175 --> 26:10.454
Oh, no, no, no.

26:10.456 --> 26:12.151
The words must be your own.

26:27.767 --> 26:30.295
You think I ought
to refuse him.

26:31.864 --> 26:34.325
I lay it down
as a general rule, Harriet,

26:34.327 --> 26:37.398
that if a woman doubts whether
she should accept a man or not,

26:37.400 --> 26:39.703
she certainly ought
to refuse him.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.911
Perhaps... it is safer.

26:47.767 --> 26:49.749
Do you think
I had better say no?

26:49.751 --> 26:52.469
Not for the world
would I advise you either way.

26:52.471 --> 26:55.319
You must be the best judge
of your own happiness.

27:06.743 --> 27:09.621
I have now...

27:09.623 --> 27:11.608
quite determined...

27:13.591 --> 27:16.439
...and really almost
made up my mind...

27:18.904 --> 27:21.494
...to...

27:21.496 --> 27:23.991
refuse Mr. Martin.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.102
<i>Refused?</i>

27:30.104 --> 27:32.982
Then she is a greater simpleton
than I ever believed her.

27:32.984 --> 27:36.182
Harriet Smith
refuse Robert Martin?

27:36.184 --> 27:37.845
I...

27:37.847 --> 27:39.477
I hope you are mistaken.

27:39.479 --> 27:40.982
I saw her answer.

27:40.984 --> 27:42.229
Nothing could be clearer.

27:42.231 --> 27:43.445
You saw her answer?

27:43.447 --> 27:45.590
You wrote her answer.
This is your doing.

27:45.592 --> 27:47.989
Emma, you persuaded her
to refuse him.

27:47.991 --> 27:50.997
Well, if I did, I should not
feel that I had done wrong.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.789
Mr. Martin's
a respectable young man,

27:52.791 --> 27:54.709
but I cannot admit him
to be Harriet's equal.

27:54.711 --> 27:57.942
No, indeed, he is her superior
in both sense and situation.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.950
Emma, your infatuation
about that girl blinds you.

28:00.952 --> 28:03.317
What are Harriet Smith's
claims, either of

28:03.319 --> 28:05.525
birth, nature or education,
to any connection

28:05.527 --> 28:07.125
higher than Robert Martin?
She is the natural daughter

28:07.127 --> 28:08.309
- of nobody knows whom.
- There can scarcely be a doubt

28:08.311 --> 28:10.037
that her father is a gentleman,
and a gentleman of fortune!

28:10.039 --> 28:11.189
Probably no settled provision
at all, and certainly

28:11.191 --> 28:12.917
- no respectable relations!
- Her allowance is very liberal.

28:12.919 --> 28:14.997
Nothing has been grudged
for her improvement.

28:14.999 --> 28:17.109
She is known only as a parlor
boarder at a common school.

28:17.111 --> 28:19.029
She is pretty,
and she is good-tempered,

28:19.031 --> 28:21.621
- and that is all.
- That is all?

28:21.623 --> 28:23.990
These are not trivial
recommendations, Mr. Knightley.

28:23.992 --> 28:25.718
Till men do fall in love

28:25.720 --> 28:27.830
with well-informed minds
instead of handsome faces,

28:27.832 --> 28:29.397
a girl with such loveliness
as Harriet

28:29.399 --> 28:31.221
has a certainty
of being admired

28:31.223 --> 28:32.630
and sought after
wherever she goes.

28:32.632 --> 28:34.581
I am very much mistaken
if your sex, in general,

28:34.583 --> 28:36.117
would not find these qualities

28:36.119 --> 28:37.365
the highest claims
a woman could possess.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.085
Upon my word, Emma,

28:40.087 --> 28:42.102
to hear you abusing
the reason you have

28:42.104 --> 28:44.661
is almost enough
to make me think so, too.

28:44.663 --> 28:45.974
Better to be
without sense altogether

28:45.976 --> 28:47.896
than to misapply it as you do.

28:54.263 --> 28:57.237
Men of sense
do not want silly wives.

28:57.239 --> 29:00.021
And more prudent men would be
afraid of the inconvenience

29:00.023 --> 29:02.102
and disgrace that
they might be involved in

29:02.104 --> 29:05.174
when the mystery of her
parentage came to be revealed.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.158
Let her marry Robert Martin,

29:07.160 --> 29:09.653
and she is safe
and respectable forever.

29:09.655 --> 29:11.894
But if you teach her
to expect to marry greatly,

29:11.896 --> 29:14.645
nobody within her reach will
ever be good enough for her.

29:14.647 --> 29:18.261
Your plans for Harriet are
best known only to yourself.

29:18.263 --> 29:21.494
But as you make no secret
of your love of matchmaking,

29:21.496 --> 29:24.342
it is fair to suppose
the plans you have.

29:24.344 --> 29:27.797
And as a friend...

29:27.799 --> 29:29.045
I shall just hint to you

29:29.047 --> 29:30.965
that if Elton is
the man that I think,

29:30.967 --> 29:32.629
it will be your labor in vain.

29:32.631 --> 29:35.958
He knows that he is
a very handsome young man

29:35.960 --> 29:37.941
and-and a great favorite
wherever he goes,

29:37.943 --> 29:39.702
but from his general
way of talking

29:39.704 --> 29:41.493
when there are
only men present,

29:41.495 --> 29:43.605
I'm convinced that he does not
mean to throw himself away.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.269
I'm very much obliged to you

29:45.271 --> 29:47.285
for opening my eyes,
Mr. Knightley,

29:47.287 --> 29:50.071
but know that I am done with
matchmaking for the present.

29:51.863 --> 29:54.071
I only want to keep Harriet
for myself.

30:38.264 --> 30:40.085
It's so beautiful!

30:40.087 --> 30:42.967
You certainly spared
no expense.

30:45.976 --> 30:50.678
♪ Hark, hark, what news
the angels bring ♪

30:50.680 --> 30:53.942
- ♪ Glad tidings of ♪
- ♪ Glad tidings of... ♪

30:53.944 --> 30:55.125
...me to do all

30:55.127 --> 30:56.213
- the disciplinary action to the children.
- You must...

30:56.215 --> 30:57.365
- It is utterly unfair.
- You, it is your responsibility

30:57.367 --> 30:59.285
and your responsibility to
teach the baby to drink milk...

30:59.287 --> 31:00.374
It is not only
my responsiility.

31:00.376 --> 31:01.302
...without spilling it
all over my favorite trousers.

31:01.304 --> 31:02.837
That is the nurse's
responsibility, not...

31:04.504 --> 31:06.869
Emma, they're here.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.597
That was unendurable.

31:12.599 --> 31:14.423
Husband, comport yourself.

31:15.479 --> 31:18.197
- Papa.
- Isabella.

31:18.199 --> 31:19.382
Emma.

31:19.384 --> 31:21.621
I shall always
be sorry you went to the sea

31:21.623 --> 31:23.061
this autumn
instead of coming here.

31:23.063 --> 31:24.117
But why should you
be sorry, sir?

31:24.119 --> 31:25.269
It did us a great deal of good.

31:25.271 --> 31:27.861
On the contrary, Mr. John
Knightley looks far from well.

31:27.863 --> 31:28.949
Southend was
strenuously recommended

31:28.951 --> 31:30.069
by our physician, sir.

31:30.071 --> 31:31.190
Sea air and sea bathing.

31:31.192 --> 31:33.110
The sea is rarely of use
to anybody.

31:33.112 --> 31:34.549
It nearly killed me once.

31:34.551 --> 31:35.702
Come.

31:35.704 --> 31:37.878
I must beg you
not to speak of the sea.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.509
Makes me miserable.

31:39.511 --> 31:41.654
And envious--
I who have never seen it.

31:41.656 --> 31:42.902
Mr. Wingfield specified
that Southend

31:42.904 --> 31:44.534
was the best place to go
for the family.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.197
Perhaps you
should change your physician.

31:46.199 --> 31:47.253
He was
recommended by my husband.

31:47.255 --> 31:49.430
Cornwall
might have been forgivable,

31:49.432 --> 31:50.901
but Southend?

31:50.903 --> 31:52.919
Let us be friends.

32:00.471 --> 32:01.878
Aw.

32:03.704 --> 32:07.349
Tell your aunt, little Emma,
that she was very wrong

32:07.351 --> 32:09.943
and she ought to set you
a better example.

32:12.951 --> 32:13.877
- Oh.
- Wh...

32:13.879 --> 32:15.861
- What is the matter? Is there fever?
- Uh...

32:15.863 --> 32:16.886
Uh...

32:16.888 --> 32:18.837
Where is the nurse?
Give her to me.

32:18.839 --> 32:19.989
- Is she feverish?
- I do not know.

32:19.991 --> 32:20.822
I-I do not know.
Wh-Where is the nurse?!

32:20.824 --> 32:23.862
- Send for Perry.
- Do not send for Perry.

32:23.864 --> 32:25.557
Send for Perry!

32:26.903 --> 32:29.527
As death follows life...

32:41.911 --> 32:43.862
Mm.

32:45.815 --> 32:46.679
Yes.

32:48.727 --> 32:53.271
As... far as
good intentions went, um...

32:54.616 --> 32:56.536
...we were both in the right.

32:59.255 --> 33:01.847
I must admit, I have not yet
been proved wrong.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.623
Mr. Knightley.

33:16.471 --> 33:19.063
Was Mr. Martin
very disappointed?

33:23.447 --> 33:25.336
A man cannot be more so.

33:52.791 --> 33:54.005
Miss Woodhouse is coming.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.471
Miss Woodhouse.

34:01.591 --> 34:02.774
Harriet!

34:04.311 --> 34:05.525
Miss Woodhouse!

34:06.616 --> 34:10.005
You're so, uh... disheveled.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.213
I'm always ill at Christmas.

34:12.215 --> 34:13.941
Get back in bed at once.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.629
You'll miss the party
at Randalls.

34:20.631 --> 34:22.549
Mr. Elton will be there.

34:22.551 --> 34:24.501
And Frank Churchill
is expected at last.

34:26.584 --> 34:28.215
And Mr. Elton's sermon.

34:32.119 --> 34:34.391
A sermon on Christmas Day.

34:39.127 --> 34:42.198
I transcribe them every Sunday.

34:45.976 --> 34:49.461
I will transcribe it for you.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.511
You are so kind to me,
Miss Woodhouse.

34:56.824 --> 34:59.157
Welcome!

34:59.159 --> 35:01.365
Welcome, my friends!

35:03.256 --> 35:05.045
Welcome!

35:05.047 --> 35:06.773
Mr. Elton.

35:06.775 --> 35:08.181
How's poor Miss Smith?

35:08.183 --> 35:09.782
Oh, no better, I'm afraid.

35:09.784 --> 35:12.693
Aw, such a sad loss
to our party today.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.645
Miss Smith has sent
her apologies.

35:14.647 --> 35:17.143
She will be missed
every moment.

35:18.167 --> 35:19.063
Ooh.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.005
How are the children?

35:22.007 --> 35:23.222
Multiplying.

35:23.224 --> 35:25.398
My only moment's rest
is in the office.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.821
Frank has been detained
at Enscombe, I'm sorry to say.

35:28.823 --> 35:29.717
Oh.

35:29.719 --> 35:32.024
I had a letter from him
just this morning.

35:37.816 --> 35:40.437
Mr. Churchill is
to inherit the entire estate.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.902
I have heard it described
as one of the finest houses

35:42.904 --> 35:44.661
in Yorkshire.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.229
Going out in dismal weather

35:50.231 --> 35:51.318
to return probably in worse.

35:51.320 --> 35:54.261
Four horses and four servants
taken out for nothing

35:54.263 --> 35:55.862
but to convey five idle...

35:55.864 --> 35:57.782
Another fine,
flourishing letter

35:57.784 --> 36:00.469
full of professions
and falsehoods?

36:00.471 --> 36:02.421
Your feelings are singular.

36:02.423 --> 36:05.269
His letters seem to
satisfy everybody else.

36:05.271 --> 36:09.045
I suspect they do not
satisfy Mrs. Weston.

36:09.047 --> 36:10.358
Were she a person
of consequence herself,

36:10.360 --> 36:11.925
he would have come by now,
I daresay.

36:11.927 --> 36:14.901
You seem determined
to think ill of him.

36:14.903 --> 36:16.757
I should be as ready
to acknowledge his merits

36:16.759 --> 36:19.029
- as any other man, but...
- I hear of none

36:19.031 --> 36:21.589
except that he is well grown
and good-looking.

36:21.591 --> 36:23.702
Well, if he has nothing else
to recommend him,

36:23.704 --> 36:25.429
he shall be a treasure
at Highbury.

36:25.431 --> 36:28.598
We do not often look
upon fine young men.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.542
Cannot ask for all the virtues
into the bargain.

36:31.544 --> 36:33.494
You will excuse my being
so much overpowered.

36:33.496 --> 36:35.414
We are both prejudiced.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.941
You against, I for him.
And we shall have

36:37.943 --> 36:39.893
no chance of agreeing
until he is really here.

36:39.895 --> 36:41.270
Prejudiced?

36:41.272 --> 36:42.933
I'm not prejudiced.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.918
Yes, but I am.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.733
Very much, and without at all
being ashamed of it.

36:47.735 --> 36:49.685
My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston

36:49.687 --> 36:52.375
gives me a decided prejudice
in his favor.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.302
Charming Miss Woodhouse.

37:01.304 --> 37:03.029
Mr. Weston.

37:29.751 --> 37:31.637
Mrs. Churchill
rules at Enscombe.

37:31.639 --> 37:33.749
Ev-Everything...

37:33.751 --> 37:35.541
gives way to her.

37:35.543 --> 37:37.589
She has decreed that if Frank

37:37.591 --> 37:39.798
does not marry
a lady of some fortune,

37:39.800 --> 37:42.229
then he will be entirely
cut out from her will.

37:42.231 --> 37:43.574
There is jealousy.

37:43.576 --> 37:46.069
She is jealous even
of his regard for his father.

37:46.071 --> 37:47.189
Jealousy...

37:47.191 --> 37:49.077
But she is so very fond
of her nephew.

37:49.079 --> 37:51.765
- He is her particular favorite.
- Dear Emma.

37:51.767 --> 37:53.877
Do not attempt,
with your good nature,

37:53.879 --> 37:55.669
to understand a bad one.

37:55.671 --> 37:57.688
You must let it go its own way.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.462
Uh, I have heard it described

38:05.464 --> 38:08.342
as one of the finest houses
in Yorksh...

38:13.240 --> 38:16.214
Mm. What seasonable weather
we're having.

38:16.216 --> 38:18.871
I dare say we shall
have snow tonight.

38:20.344 --> 38:22.581
Snow? Tonight?

38:22.583 --> 38:23.925
When did it commence?

38:23.927 --> 38:25.653
We shall call
for the carriage right away.

38:25.655 --> 38:27.349
It has hardly begun--
barely an inch--

38:27.351 --> 38:29.301
but it is falling fast.

38:29.303 --> 38:30.645
It was snowing
when your mother died.

38:30.647 --> 38:31.862
Oh, Papa, I know.
We shall get you home.

38:31.864 --> 38:32.886
Well, what is to be done? Emma!

38:32.888 --> 38:34.325
There is room for us all.

38:34.327 --> 38:35.925
We have accommodation
for all of you.

38:35.927 --> 38:37.013
Absolutely.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.165
The horses are in
good condition.

38:38.167 --> 38:39.254
I do admire
your resolution, sir,

38:39.256 --> 38:40.149
venturing out
in such weather...

38:40.151 --> 38:42.230
There's nothing we can do.
It is snowing.

38:42.232 --> 38:43.766
- Mrs. Weston, the party.
- We should go at once.

38:43.768 --> 38:44.949
Wh-Where is the carriage?
Where is James?

38:44.951 --> 38:46.805
Of course, fortunately, we do
have more than one carriage,

38:46.807 --> 38:48.566
so if one is blown over
in the wind...

38:48.568 --> 38:50.645
- Husband, please.
- Happy Christmas.

38:51.736 --> 38:53.429
I am so very sorry.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.862
- We must leave.
- I think we shall be very glad

38:55.864 --> 38:58.071
that-that Frank
did not come at Christmas.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.749
Look to your vinaigrette, Papa.

39:05.751 --> 39:07.382
Mr. Knightley, you must
move your carriage.

39:07.384 --> 39:08.693
- My father is not well.
- Take it.

39:08.695 --> 39:09.909
It is first
and will be the fastest.

39:09.911 --> 39:11.222
You will catch your death.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.981
Your husband is not...
is not strong.

39:16.408 --> 39:18.389
I'll ride with you, then.

39:18.391 --> 39:20.567
Evidently, I may not survive.

39:32.791 --> 39:33.909
Oh.

39:33.911 --> 39:35.767
Miss Woodhouse.

40:03.607 --> 40:05.525
Mr. Elton!

40:07.191 --> 40:10.005
I must avail myself
of this precious opportunity

40:10.007 --> 40:11.285
to declare sentiments
which must be

40:11.287 --> 40:12.981
- already well known.
- Mr. Elton, please.

40:12.983 --> 40:14.869
- You've drunk too much wine.
- My ardent attachment.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.149
Mr. Elton!

40:16.151 --> 40:17.879
You forget yourself.

40:19.192 --> 40:21.782
I am ready to die
if you refuse me.

40:22.904 --> 40:24.854
You take me for my friend.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.517
Any message you have
to Miss Smith,

40:26.519 --> 40:27.798
I shall be happy to deliver.

40:29.335 --> 40:30.614
For Miss Smith?

40:30.616 --> 40:32.661
A message for Miss Smith?

40:32.663 --> 40:34.197
I never thought of Miss Smith

40:34.199 --> 40:36.213
in the whole course
of my existence.

40:36.215 --> 40:39.029
Never paid her any attentions
but as your friend.

40:39.031 --> 40:41.846
Never cared whether
she were dead or alive

40:41.848 --> 40:43.829
but as your friend.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.693
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.

40:48.695 --> 40:52.437
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near?

40:52.439 --> 40:55.382
Everything I have said or done
for many weeks

40:55.384 --> 40:57.237
has been with the sole view

40:57.239 --> 41:00.855
of making my adoration
to yourself.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.647
Charming Miss Woodhouse...

41:08.791 --> 41:11.927
...allow me
to interpret this...

41:13.559 --> 41:15.351
...interesting silence.

41:16.823 --> 41:19.382
It confesses you have
long understood me.

41:19.384 --> 41:21.302
No, sir.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.478
It confesses no such thing.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.302
Nothing could be farther
from my wishes.

41:25.304 --> 41:28.085
Your pursuit of Harriet
has given me great pleasure,

41:28.087 --> 41:30.645
and I've been very earnestly
wishing your success.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.511
Miss Smith is
a very good sort of girl...

41:37.463 --> 41:40.375
...and no doubt there are men
who might not object.

41:43.480 --> 41:45.496
Everybody has their level.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.765
Madam, my visits to Hartfield
have been for yourself only,

41:51.767 --> 41:53.078
and the encouragement
I received...

41:53.080 --> 41:54.839
Encouragement?

41:56.791 --> 41:58.775
I give you encouragement?

42:00.887 --> 42:03.381
You are entirely mistaken, sir.

42:03.383 --> 42:05.656
I have no thoughts
of matrimony at present.

42:12.247 --> 42:14.294
- Driver, stop the carriage.
- Mr. Elton, please...

42:14.296 --> 42:16.214
Driver, stop the carriage!

He never loved me.

43:50.839 --> 43:52.149
He loves you.

43:52.151 --> 43:55.605
He sought to aggrandize
and enrich himself.

43:57.751 --> 43:59.511
Yes.

44:10.039 --> 44:11.447
Harriet.

44:13.144 --> 44:16.214
You might never have thought
of him but for me.

44:16.216 --> 44:18.134
I assured you
of his attachments.

44:18.136 --> 44:20.150
I contrived his visits
to Hartfield.

44:20.152 --> 44:23.222
I do not blame you,
Miss Woodhouse.

44:23.224 --> 44:26.357
I could never have
deserved him.

44:26.359 --> 44:28.662
And none but so partial
and kind a friend as you

44:28.664 --> 44:30.389
could even have
thought it possible.

44:32.248 --> 44:34.456
It's silly, really.

44:43.703 --> 44:45.525
Harriet.

44:45.527 --> 44:47.765
I cannot see it
without thinking of him.

44:47.767 --> 44:51.415
Burn the frame if you like,
but you must keep the likeness.

44:54.487 --> 44:56.246
Then I will take it.

44:56.248 --> 44:58.166
I will take it,
and I will treasure it

44:58.168 --> 44:59.991
as a picture of my friend.

45:05.144 --> 45:06.935
Goodbye, Papa.

45:09.751 --> 45:11.829
Now, are we going
to be quiet this carriage ride?

45:11.831 --> 45:13.557
Sit next to your sister.

45:13.559 --> 45:14.709
Why are you so pale?

45:14.711 --> 45:16.309
Where is the baby?
Where is the baby?

45:16.311 --> 45:17.493
Where is the baby?!

45:20.471 --> 45:21.621
Henry needs his mor-mor.

45:21.623 --> 45:23.285
We must retrieve
Henry's mor-mor.

45:23.287 --> 45:25.845
I will not stop
this carriage for a mor-mor.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.789
Goodbye, Isabella.

45:28.791 --> 45:30.136
Goodbye.

45:36.407 --> 45:37.431
Papa.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.237
I wish she would not leave.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.351
You must never leave me, Emma.

45:45.431 --> 45:47.287
Oh, Papa.

45:48.887 --> 45:50.743
You know I never could.

46:03.607 --> 46:07.286
He cannot stay away forever.

46:07.288 --> 46:10.581
The curate cannot give
the sermon forever.

46:10.583 --> 46:13.783
No one preaches
as Mr. Elton does.

46:15.767 --> 46:17.942
Hear this extract,
Miss Woodhouse.

46:17.944 --> 46:20.629
Hear this.

46:20.631 --> 46:23.383
Enough about Mr. Elton.

46:34.071 --> 46:35.445
Miss Woodhouse.

46:35.447 --> 46:37.238
Miss Smith.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.735
Such news.

46:41.047 --> 46:42.965
My niece, Jane Fairfax...

46:42.967 --> 46:46.005
Miss Woodhouse,
Jane Fairfax, she has...

46:47.608 --> 46:49.367
Jane has surprised us.
She is here.

46:50.584 --> 46:52.502
Oh, do come along.
We must have tea.

46:52.504 --> 46:54.199
It is too thrilling.

46:58.071 --> 47:00.917
She caught
a bad cold. Poor thing.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.933
So long ago
as the seventh of November.

47:02.935 --> 47:04.821
She has not been well since.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.806
And her kind friends,
the Campbells,

47:06.808 --> 47:08.789
thought she'd better come home

47:08.791 --> 47:11.829
and try an air that always
agrees with her.

47:11.831 --> 47:14.357
I hope that
your father is well.

47:14.359 --> 47:15.798
Very well. I thank you.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.718
She is very sorry to be parted

47:17.720 --> 47:20.149
from her dear friends,
the Campbells.

47:20.151 --> 47:21.302
And Mrs. Dixon.

47:21.304 --> 47:23.445
And, oh, Mr. Dixon,

47:23.447 --> 47:25.973
the most amiable young man
who did her

47:25.975 --> 47:28.757
so great a service
at Weymouth in October.

47:28.759 --> 47:31.797
I still shudder to think
what might have...

47:31.799 --> 47:34.005
if not for Mr. Dixon,

47:34.007 --> 47:37.622
with the waves and the water
and the sails.

47:37.624 --> 47:39.702
Oh.

47:39.704 --> 47:41.591
Such a charming man.

47:43.351 --> 47:45.143
Oh, dear.

47:48.247 --> 47:50.264
Is this not pleasant?

47:51.287 --> 47:53.944
She plans to stay three months.

47:56.087 --> 47:58.485
We must have you all
to Hartfield.

47:58.487 --> 48:00.629
Oh.

48:00.631 --> 48:03.509
Oh, Mother, do you hear?

48:03.511 --> 48:08.309
Miss Woodhouse has invited us
to Hartfield!

48:08.311 --> 48:11.414
Mother!
You must sample the tart.

48:17.272 --> 48:20.789
No, I do... I do...
I do not advise the custard.

48:20.791 --> 48:22.934
What do you say
to half a glass of wine?

48:22.936 --> 48:25.749
In a tumbler of water,
naturally.

48:25.751 --> 48:27.477
We shall be seeing Frank
any day now.

48:27.479 --> 48:28.725
I have...
I have no doubt of it.

48:28.727 --> 48:31.862
Oh, now, Jane,
Mr. Frank Churchill

48:31.864 --> 48:34.229
is a man much talked about
in Highbury.

48:34.231 --> 48:36.278
Is he not, Miss Woodhouse?

48:36.280 --> 48:39.254
We are all very eager
to meet him.

48:39.256 --> 48:41.749
He was at Weymouth
when Jane was there.

48:41.751 --> 48:43.927
We are very little acquainted.

48:45.655 --> 48:47.573
Frank Churchill
was at Weymouth?

48:47.575 --> 48:48.918
In October?

48:48.920 --> 48:51.319
That was the month
of his father's wedding.

48:54.199 --> 48:55.638
But you must describe him.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.367
Is he handsome?

48:58.967 --> 49:01.109
Is he agreeable?

49:01.111 --> 49:03.959
I believe he is
generally thought so.

49:06.647 --> 49:08.885
How well prepared
this custard is.

49:08.887 --> 49:11.511
I must ask your cook
for the method.

49:13.847 --> 49:17.525
♪ 'Tis the last
rose of summer ♪

49:17.527 --> 49:20.661
♪ Left blooming alone ♪

49:20.663 --> 49:24.245
♪ All her lovely companions ♪

49:49.048 --> 49:55.062

50:04.984 --> 50:07.189
Miss Fairfax.

50:07.191 --> 50:10.422
Oh, what a pity
you did not bring your music.

50:10.424 --> 50:12.917
I hope I can
recollect the tune.

50:19.127 --> 50:22.742
Nobody in the world
plays like you.

50:55.672 --> 50:59.157
I'm glad you invited
Miss Fairfax to play.

50:59.159 --> 51:01.461
Having no instrument
at her grandmother's,

51:01.463 --> 51:03.829
it must be a real indulgence.

51:03.831 --> 51:05.749
I am glad you approve.

51:05.751 --> 51:07.637
But I hope I am not
often deficient

51:07.639 --> 51:09.976
in what is due
to my guests at Hartfield.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.758
No.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.255
You are not often deficient.

51:18.520 --> 51:22.069
You make it very plain
you do not like Miss Fairfax.

51:24.088 --> 51:26.805
Everybody supposes we must be
so fond of each other

51:26.807 --> 51:28.725
because we are the same age.

51:28.727 --> 51:31.029
Ever since I can remember,
I have been told I can find

51:31.031 --> 51:33.653
no better companion
than Jane Fairfax.

51:33.655 --> 51:37.589
She who is so accomplished
and so superior.

51:37.591 --> 51:39.800
She is certainly accomplished.

51:41.783 --> 51:44.373
Perhaps the accomplished
young woman

51:44.375 --> 51:46.327
you wish to be thought
yourself.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.485
Three months of doing
more than I wish

52:06.487 --> 52:08.246
and less than I ought.

52:08.248 --> 52:10.935
That indifferent,
imperturbable statue.

52:21.976 --> 52:23.608
I must go.

52:35.128 --> 52:37.622
Harriet.

52:37.624 --> 52:38.869
Oh.

52:38.871 --> 52:40.663
We have missed you.

52:43.096 --> 52:44.885
Our mother's been
asking for you.

52:44.887 --> 52:46.807
Will you come
and visit us again?

52:52.471 --> 52:54.645
Of course.

52:54.647 --> 52:57.173
Good day, Miss Martin.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.191
Miss Catherine Martin.

53:06.136 --> 53:07.127
Mr. Martin.

53:20.087 --> 53:21.496
Miss Smith!

53:31.064 --> 53:33.845
Th... The near way is flooded.

53:35.704 --> 53:39.349
You would do better
going by Mr. Cole's stables.

53:39.351 --> 53:41.271
The ground is higher there.

53:49.400 --> 53:52.182
You behaved extremely well.

53:52.184 --> 53:54.102
And it is over.

53:54.104 --> 53:57.589
As a first meeting,
it cannot occur again.

53:57.591 --> 53:59.958
You must stay no longer
than a quarter of an hour.

53:59.960 --> 54:03.573
And allow no dangerous
reminiscences.

54:03.575 --> 54:06.197
There must be
no recurrence to the past.

54:22.807 --> 54:24.918
I seek the village
of Highbury, sir.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.742
Over the bridge,
left at The Crown.

54:26.744 --> 54:28.629
You'll see the steeple.

54:28.631 --> 54:30.229
Thank you.

54:30.231 --> 54:31.576
Very much obliged.

54:59.191 --> 55:00.376
Here we are.

55:02.104 --> 55:04.853
- My dear.
- Mrs. Weston.

55:04.855 --> 55:07.125
My son, Mr. Frank Churchill.

55:08.791 --> 55:11.669
- Miss Emma Woodhouse.
- Miss Woodhouse.

55:11.671 --> 55:14.613
He, uh... he's caught us
quite by surprise.

55:14.615 --> 55:16.533
Indeed he has.

55:16.535 --> 55:18.453
There are not many houses
in which I would

55:18.455 --> 55:21.494
presume on so far, sir, but...

55:21.496 --> 55:26.133
in coming home, I felt
I might take the liberty.

55:26.135 --> 55:28.149
We, uh... we had a plan

55:28.151 --> 55:29.685
to walk to the village, Emma.

55:29.687 --> 55:30.837
Will you join us?

55:30.839 --> 55:31.960
I would be delighted.

55:33.047 --> 55:34.677
Splendid.

55:34.679 --> 55:35.735
Right.

55:54.935 --> 55:58.742
I believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in Jane Fairfax.

55:58.744 --> 56:00.629
Did you meet often at Weymouth?

56:00.631 --> 56:02.421
Pray, let us go in here.

56:02.423 --> 56:04.758
That I may prove myself to be
a true citizen of Highbury,

56:04.760 --> 56:08.536
I must buy something at Ford's.

56:18.967 --> 56:21.014
And I beg your pardon,
Miss Woodhouse,

56:21.016 --> 56:23.509
you were speaking to me.

56:23.511 --> 56:24.950
I merely asked
whether you had known

56:24.952 --> 56:27.415
much of Miss Fairfax
and her party at Weymouth.

56:28.696 --> 56:31.189
And now that I understand
the question,

56:31.191 --> 56:33.367
I must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one.

56:34.552 --> 56:36.662
Well, it is always
the lady's right

56:36.664 --> 56:39.062
to decide on the degree
of acquaintance.

56:39.064 --> 56:42.038
You answer as discreetly
as she would herself.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.621
Though her account leaves
so much to be guessed

56:45.623 --> 56:47.669
that I really think
you may say what you like

56:47.671 --> 56:49.589
of your acquaintance with her.

56:49.591 --> 56:52.309
I only know what is
generally known.

56:52.311 --> 56:54.487
That she is poor
and of no consequence.

56:59.991 --> 57:02.294
Here's where you have
your balls, I suppose.

57:02.296 --> 57:04.502
Every fortnight through the winter.

57:04.504 --> 57:07.221
I am afraid Highbury may yet
disappoint you, Mr. Churchill.

57:07.223 --> 57:08.982
We have not society enough
for dancing.

57:08.984 --> 57:11.509
Ah, but an inn of this size
must have a ballroom,

57:11.511 --> 57:14.840
and where there is a ballroom,
there can be a ball.

57:16.439 --> 57:18.357
We cannot do without dancing.

57:21.367 --> 57:24.053
Instances have been known
of young people

57:24.055 --> 57:26.262
passing many, many months
successfully

57:26.264 --> 57:29.685
without any ball
of any description

57:29.687 --> 57:32.822
and no injury either to body
or to mind, but when...

57:32.824 --> 57:36.920
when the felicities of
rapid motion have been felt...

57:39.607 --> 57:42.678
...it must be
a very heavy heart

57:42.680 --> 57:45.269
that does not ask for more.

57:46.071 --> 57:48.213
It is very dirty inside.

57:48.215 --> 57:50.102
Oh, my dear, my dear,
you are too particular.

57:50.104 --> 57:53.045
By candlelight, it'll be
as clean as Randalls.

57:53.047 --> 57:54.869
We must have a ball.

57:54.871 --> 57:58.773
Yes, and when we do,
may I hope for the honor

57:58.775 --> 58:01.431
of your hand
for the first two dances?

58:04.696 --> 58:06.582
The Coles are to hold a
supper party in Frank's honor,

58:06.584 --> 58:08.600
and perhaps there'll be
dancing there.

58:11.959 --> 58:15.318
So, Emma Woodhouse
deigned to accept

58:15.320 --> 58:18.198
an invitation
from the merchant Mr. Cole.

58:18.200 --> 58:21.557
Mr. Churchill will soon
return to Yorkshire.

58:21.559 --> 58:24.021
We must make the most of every
opportunity until he does.

58:24.023 --> 58:25.429
"We must."

58:25.431 --> 58:26.645
He's in Highbury
only two weeks.

58:26.647 --> 58:28.629
And yet he spent a whole day
going to London

58:28.631 --> 58:30.422
just to get his hair cut.

58:30.424 --> 58:33.237
16 miles, twice over.

58:33.239 --> 58:35.541
He's a trifling, silly fop.

58:39.031 --> 58:40.087
Indeed.

58:47.639 --> 58:50.453
Mr. Cole.

58:50.455 --> 58:53.525
Such grand estates you have
in common, gentlemen.

58:53.527 --> 58:54.710
Donwell Abbey.

58:54.712 --> 58:56.502
Enscombe,
soon to inherit, of course.

58:56.504 --> 58:58.358
Soon to inherit Enscombe.

58:58.360 --> 59:00.117
Not too soon.

59:00.119 --> 59:04.087
I trust your uncle Churchill
is in good health?

59:05.464 --> 59:06.839
Uh, excellent health.

59:29.848 --> 59:31.766
And have you heard
the choicest piece of gossip

59:31.768 --> 59:34.005
that has set all the tongues
of the village aflame?

59:34.007 --> 59:37.142
A pianoforte, very elegant,
delivered to Miss Fairfax

59:37.144 --> 59:39.509
this very morning
with no return address.

59:39.511 --> 59:41.301
I never saw so fine
an instrument.

59:41.303 --> 59:45.141
A pianoforte, very elegant,
and with no return address.

59:45.143 --> 59:46.358
No return address.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.278
Jane herself
is quite at a loss.

59:48.280 --> 59:50.294
Quite bewildered to think
who could have sent it.

59:50.296 --> 59:52.149
Bewildered, indeed.

1:00:01.687 --> 1:00:03.349
Why do you smile?

1:00:03.351 --> 1:00:04.567
Nay, why do you?

1:00:05.624 --> 1:00:07.317
I suppose I smile for pleasure.

1:00:07.319 --> 1:00:11.157
A pianoforte is
a very handsome present.

1:00:11.159 --> 1:00:13.173
I rather wonder
it was never made before.

1:00:13.175 --> 1:00:15.062
Perhaps Miss Fairfax
has never been

1:00:15.064 --> 1:00:17.109
staying here so long before.

1:00:17.111 --> 1:00:18.261
Or that Colonel Campbell
did not

1:00:18.263 --> 1:00:19.989
give her use
of his own instrument,

1:00:19.991 --> 1:00:22.742
which must now be shut up
in London untouched by anybody.

1:00:23.896 --> 1:00:25.814
She has done her hair
in so odd a way.

1:00:25.816 --> 1:00:28.343
I never saw anything like it.

1:00:29.656 --> 1:00:31.221
Must be a fancy of her own.

1:00:31.223 --> 1:00:32.438
I see nobody else
looking like her.

1:00:34.039 --> 1:00:36.117
If Colonel Campbell
is not the giver,

1:00:36.119 --> 1:00:37.205
who can be?

1:00:37.207 --> 1:00:38.582
Mrs. Dixon?

1:00:38.584 --> 1:00:42.198
As a token of her...
her friendship, perhaps?

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.342
What say you to Mr. Dixon?

1:00:44.344 --> 1:00:45.845
Mr. Dixon?

1:00:45.847 --> 1:00:47.509
He saved her life.

1:00:47.511 --> 1:00:49.365
Did you hear of it?

1:00:49.367 --> 1:00:51.349
A water party,
and by some accident,

1:00:51.351 --> 1:00:52.982
she was falling overboard.

1:00:52.984 --> 1:00:54.485
He caught her.

1:00:54.487 --> 1:00:55.576
Huh.

1:00:58.231 --> 1:01:00.278
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:02.200
a duet.

1:01:05.047 --> 1:01:07.382
What do you say to this, Emma?

1:01:07.384 --> 1:01:10.965
I have made a match between
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.

1:01:12.727 --> 1:01:14.645
Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax?

1:01:14.647 --> 1:01:16.725
This pianoforte's
been sent to her by somebody.

1:01:16.727 --> 1:01:19.253
And she has always been
a favorite with him.

1:01:19.255 --> 1:01:21.590
Tonight, he sent his carriage
for her as a courtesy

1:01:21.592 --> 1:01:23.445
and walked himself.

1:01:23.447 --> 1:01:26.165
Was that not gallant?

1:01:26.167 --> 1:01:28.087
Mr. Weston.

1:01:44.344 --> 1:01:49.430

1:03:48.919 --> 1:03:51.158
"Enter not into judgment

1:03:53.464 --> 1:03:55.927

1:04:16.216 --> 1:04:18.005
He's married.

1:04:18.007 --> 1:04:19.893
It cannot be
a long acquaintance.

1:04:19.895 --> 1:04:21.911
He's only been gone six weeks.

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.511
My wife, Mrs. Augusta Elton.

1:04:43.895 --> 1:04:45.717
This house is very like

1:04:45.719 --> 1:04:49.365
my brother Mr. Suckling's seat
at Maple Grove.

1:04:49.367 --> 1:04:51.285
Very like.

1:04:51.287 --> 1:04:54.645
I'm quite struck by
the likeness.

1:04:54.647 --> 1:04:56.502
Is it not astonishingly like,
dear husband?

1:04:56.504 --> 1:04:58.197
Very like.

1:04:58.199 --> 1:05:00.053
I really could almost
fancy myself at Maple Grove.

1:05:00.055 --> 1:05:01.302
The staircase as I came in--

1:05:01.304 --> 1:05:03.926
I observed how very like
the staircase is.

1:05:03.928 --> 1:05:06.136
Placed in exactly the same part
of the house.

1:05:08.567 --> 1:05:11.573
I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,
it is very delightful to me

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:14.774
to be reminded of a place
I am so extremely partial to

1:05:14.776 --> 1:05:16.694
as Maple Grove.

1:05:16.696 --> 1:05:18.902
A most impressive residence.

1:05:18.904 --> 1:05:21.782
Whenever you are transplanted

1:05:21.784 --> 1:05:25.013
like me, Miss Woodhouse,

1:05:25.015 --> 1:05:26.837
you will understand
how very delightful it is

1:05:26.839 --> 1:05:28.085
to meet with anything at all

1:05:28.087 --> 1:05:30.904
that reminds one
of what one has left behind.

1:05:33.719 --> 1:05:35.765
We have been calling
at Randalls.

1:05:35.767 --> 1:05:38.357
What pleasant people
the Westons seem to be.

1:05:38.359 --> 1:05:40.341
And who should call in
while we were there?

1:05:41.399 --> 1:05:42.549
Knightley.

1:05:42.551 --> 1:05:45.109
Knightley himself.

1:05:45.111 --> 1:05:48.245
Of course, as so particular
a friend of Mr. E's,

1:05:48.247 --> 1:05:50.933
I had a great curiosity
to meet him.

1:05:50.935 --> 1:05:53.142
"My friend Knightley"
had been so often mentioned

1:05:53.144 --> 1:05:55.669
that I really was
impatient to see him.

1:05:55.671 --> 1:05:59.573
And I must do
my <i>cara sposo</i> the justice

1:05:59.575 --> 1:06:03.830
to say that he need not be
at all ashamed of his friend.

1:06:03.832 --> 1:06:06.229
"Knightley."

1:06:06.231 --> 1:06:08.085
I could not have believed it.
"Knightley."

1:06:08.087 --> 1:06:09.462
Never met him before
in her life

1:06:09.464 --> 1:06:10.581
and calls him "Knightley."

1:06:10.583 --> 1:06:12.662
And to discover
that he is a gentleman.

1:06:12.664 --> 1:06:14.358
Upstart, vulgar being,

1:06:14.360 --> 1:06:16.886
with her "Mr. E"
and her <i>cara sposo.</i>

1:06:16.888 --> 1:06:18.102
Emma.

1:06:18.104 --> 1:06:19.895
- Mr. Weston.
- Miss Smith.

1:06:21.304 --> 1:06:23.958
The Churchills
have settled at Richmond.

1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:25.526
Here.

1:06:25.528 --> 1:06:26.742
Frank is returning.

1:06:26.744 --> 1:06:28.725
We shall have our ball.

1:06:32.375 --> 1:06:34.197
No. No.

1:06:34.199 --> 1:06:36.470
- You are Frank Churchill.
- Oh.

1:06:36.472 --> 1:06:38.327
Of course.

1:06:53.591 --> 1:06:55.445
You dance so beautifully.

1:07:00.887 --> 1:07:02.325
Oh.

1:07:02.327 --> 1:07:04.949
Oh, this is brilliant, indeed.

1:07:04.951 --> 1:07:07.125
This is admirable.

1:07:07.127 --> 1:07:10.485
Excellently contrived,
upon my word.

1:07:10.487 --> 1:07:12.566
Nothing wanting.

1:07:12.568 --> 1:07:14.805
Oh! Miss Woodhouse.

1:07:14.807 --> 1:07:16.725
You must really have had
Aladdin's lamp.

1:07:18.231 --> 1:07:21.494
This is meeting
quite in fairyland.

1:07:21.496 --> 1:07:23.510
Such a transformation.

1:07:23.512 --> 1:07:26.229
Now, where shall we sit?
Where shall we sit?

1:07:26.231 --> 1:07:28.310
Oh, now, anywhere where Jane
is not in a draft.

1:07:28.312 --> 1:07:29.973
How do you like my gown?

1:07:29.975 --> 1:07:31.669
- Oh!
- Oh, Mr. Elton!

1:07:31.671 --> 1:07:33.974
I do not know whether
it is not over-trimmed.

1:07:33.976 --> 1:07:37.365
I have the greatest dislike to
the idea of being over-trimmed.

1:07:37.367 --> 1:07:38.774
Quite a horror of finery.

1:07:38.776 --> 1:07:40.694
Of course, I must put on

1:07:40.696 --> 1:07:43.445
a few ornaments now
because it is expected.

1:07:43.447 --> 1:07:46.518
A bride, you know,
must appear like a bride.

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:49.336
But my natural taste
is all for simplicity.

1:07:50.871 --> 1:07:52.725
How do you like Jane's hair?

1:07:52.727 --> 1:07:54.645
She did it all herself.

1:07:54.647 --> 1:07:55.862
Too wonderful.

1:07:55.864 --> 1:07:57.909
No hairdresser
from London, I think,

1:07:57.911 --> 1:07:59.767
could do a finer style.

1:08:09.431 --> 1:08:11.349
Emma,
it has just occurred to us

1:08:11.351 --> 1:08:14.582
that Mrs. Elton will expect
to be asked to begin the ball.

1:08:14.584 --> 1:08:17.238
And she will surely think
Frank ought to ask her.

1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:19.190
Frank cannot break
his promise to you.

1:08:19.192 --> 1:08:21.078
He's promised you
the first two dances.

1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:22.549
Here's the plan.

1:08:22.551 --> 1:08:24.822
I will ask Mrs. Elton.

1:08:24.824 --> 1:08:27.415
The ball is in Frank's honor,
but it's in my design.

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.424
I shall ask her.

1:08:31.672 --> 1:08:34.005
You must submit
to stand second.

1:08:34.007 --> 1:08:37.877
A bride must be first
in company.

1:08:37.879 --> 1:08:40.085
It is almost enough
to make me think of marrying.

1:08:40.087 --> 1:08:41.205
Oh.

1:08:41.207 --> 1:08:42.773
Must I go first?

1:08:42.775 --> 1:08:45.014
I really am ashamed
to always be

1:08:45.016 --> 1:08:47.383
leading the way.

1:08:52.792 --> 1:08:53.781
Gentlemen.

1:09:15.319 --> 1:09:17.493
You have been much missed
in Highbury.

1:09:17.495 --> 1:09:19.191
Have I?

1:09:27.991 --> 1:09:29.207
How is your aunt?

1:09:30.263 --> 1:09:32.565
Most reluctant to release me.

1:09:58.519 --> 1:10:00.437
Do you not dance, Mr. Elton?

1:10:00.439 --> 1:10:02.709
Most readily, Mrs. Weston,
if you will dance with me.

1:10:02.711 --> 1:10:04.502
- Oh.
- Ah.

1:10:04.504 --> 1:10:06.389
Well, perhaps...

1:10:06.391 --> 1:10:09.237
There is a young lady
disengaged

1:10:09.239 --> 1:10:11.480
whom I should be very glad
to see dancing-- Miss Smith.

1:10:13.271 --> 1:10:16.310
Miss Smith.

1:10:16.312 --> 1:10:18.645
If I were not
an old married man.

1:10:18.647 --> 1:10:19.989
But my dancing days are over.

1:10:19.991 --> 1:10:21.976
Mrs. Weston,
you will excuse me.

1:10:34.327 --> 1:10:36.823
Will you dance, Miss Smith?

1:12:03.351 --> 1:12:05.558
Thank you.

1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:07.640
For your kindness to Harriet.

1:12:11.512 --> 1:12:14.229
He was unpardonably rude.

1:12:14.231 --> 1:12:16.951
And he aimed at wounding
more than Harriet.

1:12:18.775 --> 1:12:21.974
I was completely mistaken
in Mr. Elton.

1:12:21.976 --> 1:12:23.894
There is a littleness about him

1:12:23.896 --> 1:12:25.784
which you discovered
and I did not.

1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:30.485
You would have chosen
for him better

1:12:30.487 --> 1:12:33.045
than he has chosen for himself.

1:12:33.047 --> 1:12:37.077
Harriet Smith has some
first-rate qualities

1:12:37.079 --> 1:12:40.024
which Mrs. Elton
is totally without.

1:12:42.007 --> 1:12:45.141
She does you credit, Emma,
as you do her.

1:12:45.143 --> 1:12:46.709
Ah.

1:12:46.711 --> 1:12:48.533
Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
Come.

1:12:48.535 --> 1:12:49.653
Set your companions an example.

1:12:49.655 --> 1:12:50.774
They're all lazy.

1:12:50.776 --> 1:12:52.245
They're all asleep!

1:12:52.247 --> 1:12:53.493
We must dance another set.

1:12:53.495 --> 1:12:55.384
I am ready
whenever I am wanted.

1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:00.887
With whom will you dance?

1:13:02.968 --> 1:13:04.184
With you.

1:13:05.944 --> 1:13:07.862
If you will ask me.

1:13:07.864 --> 1:13:09.141
You have shown
that you can dance,

1:13:09.143 --> 1:13:11.829
and we are not really so much
brother and sister

1:13:11.831 --> 1:13:13.526
as to make it improper.

1:13:13.528 --> 1:13:14.776
No, indeed.

1:13:26.839 --> 1:13:27.926
Stop it.

1:13:27.928 --> 1:13:29.078
Stop embarrassing yourself.

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:31.190
I am not embarrassing myself!

1:17:03.799 --> 1:17:05.045
Oh!

1:17:06.967 --> 1:17:08.885
Mr. Churchill. Harriet.

1:17:08.887 --> 1:17:10.262
- Oh!
- What has happened?

1:17:10.264 --> 1:17:11.990
She was set upon by some
gypsies as she was coming home.

1:17:11.992 --> 1:17:14.774
When she attempted escape,
she fell.

1:17:14.776 --> 1:17:16.469
She had a cramp.

1:17:16.471 --> 1:17:19.445
- From too much dancing!
- Well, is she hurt?

1:17:19.447 --> 1:17:20.438
I didn't see.

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:22.581
I arrived moments after...

1:17:22.583 --> 1:17:24.949
...and brought her here.

1:17:24.951 --> 1:17:26.229
I could think of
no other place.

1:17:26.231 --> 1:17:27.957
To the drawing room.

1:17:27.959 --> 1:17:30.422
It was on account
of the scissors!

1:17:30.424 --> 1:17:31.925
The scissors?

1:17:31.927 --> 1:17:33.749
- Oh!
- I...

1:17:36.695 --> 1:17:39.734
...borrowed a pair of scissors
from Miss Bates.

1:17:39.736 --> 1:17:42.197
I was halfway home

1:17:42.199 --> 1:17:44.117
when I made the recollection

1:17:44.119 --> 1:17:48.117
and so doubled back.

1:17:48.119 --> 1:17:49.877
Whew.

1:17:58.648 --> 1:17:59.831
What is your purpose here?

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:04.790
Um, my-my... carriage...

1:18:04.792 --> 1:18:06.678
My... Uh, my horse
threw a shoe.

1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:08.405
You took
your carriage to the ball?

1:18:08.407 --> 1:18:09.782
Yes.

1:18:09.784 --> 1:18:12.245
What might have become of me,
Miss Woodhouse,

1:18:12.247 --> 1:18:14.069
if not for the scissors?

1:18:14.071 --> 1:18:15.127
We must send for Perry.

1:18:17.111 --> 1:18:19.029
Miss Woodhouse.

1:18:20.951 --> 1:18:22.805
I believe I am in love again.

1:18:22.807 --> 1:18:24.725
Mrs. Goddard
should be assured of her safety.

1:18:24.727 --> 1:18:25.782
Yes, and I shall
rouse my father.

1:18:25.784 --> 1:18:26.709
We ought to let them know

1:18:26.711 --> 1:18:28.598
that there are gypsies
in the neighborhood.

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.263
Yes, let us go at once.

1:18:31.607 --> 1:18:33.782
- Oh, Miss Woodhouse.
- Say nothing more.

1:18:33.784 --> 1:18:35.478
Do not go!

1:18:37.079 --> 1:18:38.135
Mr. Churchill.

1:18:39.831 --> 1:18:41.846
Please.

1:18:41.848 --> 1:18:43.094
Stay.

1:18:51.575 --> 1:18:52.982
What is the matter?
What has happened?

1:18:52.984 --> 1:18:54.582
What... Is she...
is she... is she alive?

1:18:54.584 --> 1:18:56.277
Harriet is unharmed, Papa.

1:18:56.279 --> 1:18:57.621
We have Mr. Churchill to thank.

1:18:57.623 --> 1:18:59.318
Please stay.

1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:01.334
Mr. Knightley
can sound the alarm.

1:19:01.336 --> 1:19:03.829
We will both go.

1:19:03.831 --> 1:19:04.917
Why are we alarmed?

1:19:04.919 --> 1:19:06.837
We have sent for Perry, Papa.

1:19:06.839 --> 1:19:08.757
He's your superior,
no doubt, but...

1:19:08.759 --> 1:19:10.517
but wonderful things
have taken place.

1:19:10.519 --> 1:19:12.021
There have been matches
of greater disparity.

1:19:12.023 --> 1:19:15.509
Believe me, I have not
the presumption to suppose.

1:19:15.511 --> 1:19:16.821
No, but the service
he rendered you.

1:19:16.823 --> 1:19:18.229
Service?

1:19:19.576 --> 1:19:22.325
The very recollection of it,

1:19:22.327 --> 1:19:25.077
and all that I felt.

1:19:25.079 --> 1:19:29.205
His coming to me,
his noble look.

1:19:29.207 --> 1:19:33.463
Such a change in one moment
from misery to...

1:19:37.144 --> 1:19:39.381
...to perfect happiness.

1:19:39.383 --> 1:19:40.821
I was very wrong before.

1:19:40.823 --> 1:19:42.485
I will be cautious now.

1:19:42.487 --> 1:19:44.536
I am determined against
any interference.

1:20:26.647 --> 1:20:29.397
What is this I hear, dear Jane,

1:20:29.399 --> 1:20:31.349
about your going
to the post office

1:20:31.351 --> 1:20:32.661
in the rain last week?

1:20:32.663 --> 1:20:34.262
Why, you sad girl.

1:20:34.264 --> 1:20:36.086
Why would you do such a thing?

1:20:36.088 --> 1:20:39.285
I will not allow you
to do such a thing again.

1:20:39.287 --> 1:20:41.174
I shall speak to Mr. E.

1:20:41.176 --> 1:20:43.094
The man who fetches
our letters--

1:20:43.096 --> 1:20:45.045
one of our men,
I forget his name--

1:20:45.047 --> 1:20:47.990
shall inquire for yours, too.

1:20:47.992 --> 1:20:51.062
Do you suppose Mr. Knightley
might extend us all

1:20:51.064 --> 1:20:54.229
an invitation to the abbey,
Miss Woodhouse?

1:20:54.231 --> 1:20:56.277
I love to explore great houses,

1:20:56.279 --> 1:20:59.510
and I fear I have
long exhausted Highbury.

1:20:59.512 --> 1:21:01.173
I'm afraid
Mr. Knightley's concerns

1:21:01.175 --> 1:21:02.805
are all for his tenants

1:21:02.807 --> 1:21:04.278
and none for his house,
Mrs. Elton.

1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:06.422
His ballrooms and picture
galleries are quite shut up.

1:21:06.424 --> 1:21:08.789
I should be very glad
to open Donwell

1:21:08.791 --> 1:21:10.613
for your exploration,
Mrs. Elton.

1:21:10.615 --> 1:21:12.437
- The welcome is long overdue.
- Mm.

1:21:12.439 --> 1:21:14.774
I should like that
of all things.

1:21:14.776 --> 1:21:16.790
Name your day, and I will come.

1:21:16.792 --> 1:21:19.317
I cannot
name a day until I have spoken

1:21:19.319 --> 1:21:21.462
to some others whom I would
wish to form the party.

1:21:21.464 --> 1:21:23.285
Oh, leave that to me.
It is my party.

1:21:23.287 --> 1:21:24.342
I will invite your guests.

1:21:24.344 --> 1:21:26.102
I hope you will bring Elton,

1:21:26.104 --> 1:21:30.198
but I will not trouble you
to give any other invitations.

1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:31.862
Oh.

1:21:31.864 --> 1:21:34.677
Oh, well, now you are
looking very sly.

1:21:34.679 --> 1:21:37.142
But consider,
you need not be afraid

1:21:37.144 --> 1:21:38.774
of delegating power to me.

1:21:38.776 --> 1:21:41.685
Married women, you know,
may be safely authorized.

1:21:41.687 --> 1:21:44.565
There is but one
married woman in all the world

1:21:44.567 --> 1:21:46.166
whom I can ever allow

1:21:46.168 --> 1:21:49.173
to invite what guests
she pleases to Donwell.

1:21:49.175 --> 1:21:50.390
Mrs. Weston, I suppose?

1:21:50.392 --> 1:21:52.789
No. Mrs. Knightley.

1:21:52.791 --> 1:21:56.503
Until she is in being, I will
manage such matters myself.

1:22:24.727 --> 1:22:26.711
Oh, my heavens.

1:22:32.279 --> 1:22:34.389
Do you not feel transported?

1:22:34.391 --> 1:22:37.336
I can hardly believe
that we remain in England.

1:22:46.487 --> 1:22:47.925
And I was to accompany him,

1:22:47.927 --> 1:22:51.285
but the night before his going,
I was struck down by a fever,

1:22:51.287 --> 1:22:52.696
and so I did not go.

1:22:55.319 --> 1:22:56.661
Please excuse me.

1:22:56.663 --> 1:22:58.295
Of course.

1:23:09.559 --> 1:23:10.902
There is an excellent prospect

1:23:10.904 --> 1:23:12.981
from the south window,
Miss Smith.

1:23:12.983 --> 1:23:14.807
May I escort you?

1:23:19.607 --> 1:23:21.429
Jane of course
knows a great deal

1:23:21.431 --> 1:23:23.029
more of the world than I.

1:23:23.031 --> 1:23:24.213
She has been to Ireland.

1:23:30.007 --> 1:23:31.669
Will you...

1:23:31.671 --> 1:23:33.974
be so kind when I am missed

1:23:33.976 --> 1:23:35.958
to say that I am gone home?

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:38.486
If you wish it.

1:23:38.488 --> 1:23:40.727
But you're not going to walk
back to Highbury alone.

1:23:43.447 --> 1:23:45.431
- Are you unwell?
- Miss Woodhouse...

1:23:48.119 --> 1:23:51.320
We all know at times what it is
to be wearied in spirits.

1:23:53.047 --> 1:23:57.016
Mine, I confess, are exhausted.

1:24:16.312 --> 1:24:18.200
Have I missed the party?

1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:22.517
Not at all.

1:24:22.519 --> 1:24:24.375
We're exploring the house.

1:24:28.311 --> 1:24:30.422
I was detained by my aunt.

1:24:30.424 --> 1:24:33.109
A nervous seizure
which lasted some hours.

1:24:33.111 --> 1:24:34.389
Had I known how hot a ride
I should have,

1:24:34.391 --> 1:24:36.021
I believe I should not
have come at all.

1:24:36.023 --> 1:24:38.165
You will soon
be cooler if you sit down.

1:24:38.167 --> 1:24:40.151
Some cold beer, perhaps.

1:24:43.735 --> 1:24:46.581
As soon as my aunt gets well
again, I shall go abroad.

1:24:46.583 --> 1:24:47.798
I'm tired of doing nothing.

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:49.878
I want a change.

1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:51.542
I'm serious, Miss Woodhouse,

1:24:51.544 --> 1:24:53.750
whatever your penetrating eyes
may fancy.

1:24:53.752 --> 1:24:55.670
I'm sick of England.

1:24:55.672 --> 1:24:58.229
You are sick of prosperity
and indulgence.

1:24:58.231 --> 1:25:00.149
Cannot you invent
a few hardships for yourself

1:25:00.151 --> 1:25:01.909
and be contented to stay?

1:25:01.911 --> 1:25:04.214
You are quite mistaken.
I do not look upon myself

1:25:04.216 --> 1:25:06.134
as either prosperous
or indulged.

1:25:09.591 --> 1:25:11.639
We're going to Box Hill
tomorrow.

1:25:13.463 --> 1:25:16.758
It is not the grand tour,
but it will be something

1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:20.277
for a young man
so much in want of change.

1:25:20.279 --> 1:25:23.349
Well, if you wish me to stay
and join the party,

1:25:23.351 --> 1:25:25.207
I will.

1:25:35.575 --> 1:25:39.573
How much I am obliged to you
for telling me to come today.

1:25:39.575 --> 1:25:42.453
I had quite determined
to go away again.

1:25:42.455 --> 1:25:44.983
Yes, you were very cross.

1:26:00.439 --> 1:26:04.437
Our companions
are excessively stupid.

1:26:04.439 --> 1:26:06.614
What shall we do to rouse them?

1:26:06.616 --> 1:26:09.077
Hmm? Any nonsense will serve.

1:26:09.079 --> 1:26:10.485
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:26:10.487 --> 1:26:12.949
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse
to say that

1:26:12.951 --> 1:26:14.997
she desires to know
what you're all thinking of.

1:26:16.343 --> 1:26:19.062
Dear. What we are thinking of?

1:26:19.064 --> 1:26:21.302
Is Miss Woodhouse sure
that she would like to know

1:26:21.304 --> 1:26:22.742
what we are all thinking of?

1:26:22.744 --> 1:26:24.597
No, no.
Upon no account in the world.

1:26:24.599 --> 1:26:25.814
It is the very last thing

1:26:25.816 --> 1:26:27.605
I would stand the brunt of
just now.

1:26:27.607 --> 1:26:30.389
It is the sort of thing
which I should not

1:26:30.391 --> 1:26:34.454
have thought myself privileged
to inquire into, as...

1:26:34.456 --> 1:26:37.205
<i>chaperon</i> of the party.

1:26:37.207 --> 1:26:38.997
Very true, my love.

1:26:38.999 --> 1:26:40.214
Very true.

1:26:40.216 --> 1:26:42.837
But some ladies
will say anything.

1:26:42.839 --> 1:26:45.717
Best to pass it off as a joke.

1:26:45.719 --> 1:26:47.733
Everybody knows
what is due to you.

1:26:47.735 --> 1:26:49.814
They are
most of them affronted.

1:26:49.816 --> 1:26:52.502
I will attack them
with more address.

1:26:52.504 --> 1:26:53.654
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:26:53.656 --> 1:26:56.534
I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse

1:26:56.536 --> 1:26:58.133
to say that
she waives her right

1:26:58.135 --> 1:26:59.925
of knowing what
you may be thinking of

1:26:59.927 --> 1:27:02.869
and only requires something
entertaining from each of you.

1:27:02.871 --> 1:27:04.182
She demands either
one thing very clever

1:27:04.184 --> 1:27:06.773
or two things moderately clever

1:27:06.775 --> 1:27:09.717
or three things
very dull indeed.

1:27:09.719 --> 1:27:11.669
And she engages

1:27:11.671 --> 1:27:13.142
to laugh heartily at them all.

1:27:13.144 --> 1:27:15.349
Oh. V-Very well, then.

1:27:15.351 --> 1:27:17.462
I need not be uneasy.

1:27:17.464 --> 1:27:20.149
"Three things
very dull indeed."

1:27:20.151 --> 1:27:21.621
That will do just for me.

1:27:21.623 --> 1:27:23.989
I shall be sure to say
three dull things

1:27:23.991 --> 1:27:25.365
as soon as I open my mouth.

1:27:25.367 --> 1:27:27.222
Ah, ma'am, but there is
the difficulty.

1:27:27.224 --> 1:27:29.623
When have you ever
stopped at three?

1:27:35.992 --> 1:27:37.751
Oh.

1:27:40.343 --> 1:27:43.544
No. I see what she-she means.

1:27:46.168 --> 1:27:48.245
I shall try to hold my tongue.

1:27:59.224 --> 1:28:00.854
I-I like this plan.

1:28:00.856 --> 1:28:03.734
Uh, agreed, agreed,
agreed, agreed.

1:28:03.736 --> 1:28:05.525
Uh, I shall do my best.

1:28:05.527 --> 1:28:07.701
Um...

1:28:07.703 --> 1:28:10.069
I'm making a conundrum.

1:28:10.071 --> 1:28:11.285
How will a conundrum reckon?

1:28:11.287 --> 1:28:13.334
Low, I am afraid, sir,

1:28:13.336 --> 1:28:15.285
but we shall, uh,
be indulgent...

1:28:15.287 --> 1:28:20.054
Mr. Knightley, I must have
made myself very disagreeable,

1:28:20.056 --> 1:28:23.990
or she would not have said
such a thing to an old friend.

1:28:23.992 --> 1:28:26.389
I cannot think
what I have done.

1:28:26.391 --> 1:28:28.502
What two letters

1:28:28.504 --> 1:28:32.246
of the alphabet are there
that express perfection?

1:28:32.248 --> 1:28:34.997
What two letters...

1:28:34.999 --> 1:28:36.374
...express perfection?

1:28:36.376 --> 1:28:38.997
I... I'm sure I do not know.

1:28:38.999 --> 1:28:40.502
Well, I shall tell you.

1:28:40.504 --> 1:28:42.677
"M" and "A." "Emma."

1:28:45.655 --> 1:28:46.902
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1:28:46.904 --> 1:28:48.501
Mr. Weston has shown us how

1:28:48.503 --> 1:28:50.582
to play this game
but also how to end it,

1:28:50.584 --> 1:28:52.821
for who can improve
upon perfection?

1:28:52.823 --> 1:28:54.678
I protest, I must be excused.

1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:57.141
I do not pretend to be a wit.

1:28:57.143 --> 1:28:59.445
I really must be allowed
to judge when to speak

1:28:59.447 --> 1:29:01.205
and when to hold my tongue.

1:29:01.207 --> 1:29:02.390
Shall we walk, Augusta?

1:29:02.392 --> 1:29:03.414
Most willingly.

1:29:03.416 --> 1:29:06.645
I am very tired of exploring
so long on one spot.

1:29:06.647 --> 1:29:08.822
Shall we join
Mrs. Elton, ma'am?

1:29:08.824 --> 1:29:10.742
If you please, my dear.

1:29:10.744 --> 1:29:13.559
With all my heart,
I am quite ready.

1:30:06.904 --> 1:30:10.550
How could you be
so unfeeling to Miss Bates?

1:30:10.552 --> 1:30:12.374
It was not so very bad.

1:30:12.376 --> 1:30:16.214
How could you be so insolent
to a woman of her character

1:30:16.216 --> 1:30:18.709
and-and-and age
and-and situation?

1:30:18.711 --> 1:30:20.629
I dare say she did not
understand me.

1:30:20.631 --> 1:30:21.813
I assure you she did.

1:30:21.815 --> 1:30:22.998
She felt your full meaning.

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:24.791
She has talked of it since.

1:30:26.615 --> 1:30:28.758
I know there is not a better
creature in the world...

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:31.189
I wish you could have heard
how she talked of it--

1:30:31.191 --> 1:30:33.269
w-with what candor
and-and generosity.

1:30:33.271 --> 1:30:35.414
You must allow that what is
good and what is ridiculous

1:30:35.416 --> 1:30:37.046
are most unfortunately
blended in her.

1:30:37.048 --> 1:30:39.029
They are blended in her,
I acknowledge.

1:30:39.031 --> 1:30:41.078
And were she
a woman of fortune,

1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:43.190
I would not quarrel with you
for any liberties of manner,

1:30:43.192 --> 1:30:44.757
but she is poor.

1:30:44.759 --> 1:30:46.742
She has sunk from the comfort
she was born to,

1:30:46.744 --> 1:30:49.557
and if she lived to an old age,
she will probably sink more.

1:30:49.559 --> 1:30:51.477
- It is too hot, and...
- She has seen you grow up

1:30:51.479 --> 1:30:53.654
- from when her notice of you was an honor.
- And I am tired!

1:30:53.656 --> 1:30:56.309
To have you now,
in thoughtless spirits

1:30:56.311 --> 1:30:57.525
and the pride of the moment,

1:30:57.527 --> 1:31:00.149
laugh at her
and-and humble her,

1:31:00.151 --> 1:31:02.165
and before her niece
and before others, many of whom

1:31:02.167 --> 1:31:04.149
are entirely guided
by your treatment of her!

1:31:04.151 --> 1:31:05.751
It was badly done, indeed!

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:24.917
Go!

1:31:50.999 --> 1:31:54.136
I have been
unpardonably vain...

1:31:56.120 --> 1:31:58.040
...and insufferably arrogant.

1:32:00.727 --> 1:32:02.711
I have been inconsiderate...

1:32:04.823 --> 1:32:08.661
...and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling and...

1:33:21.239 --> 1:33:23.989
I'm afraid Jane
is not very well.

1:33:23.991 --> 1:33:26.069
Dreadful headache.

1:33:26.071 --> 1:33:27.959
Writing all morning.

1:33:28.984 --> 1:33:30.902
Such long letters.

1:33:30.904 --> 1:33:33.463
I said, "My dear,
you shall blind yourself."

1:33:35.224 --> 1:33:37.655
I'm so very sorry, Miss Bates.

1:33:38.872 --> 1:33:41.366
Please give Jane
my good wishes.

1:33:41.368 --> 1:33:43.157
You were kept waiting
at the door.

1:33:43.159 --> 1:33:44.149
I was quite ashamed.

1:33:44.151 --> 1:33:46.581
No, you... you see,
there was a little bustle,

1:33:46.583 --> 1:33:48.662
for it so happened
we did not hear the knock,

1:33:48.664 --> 1:33:50.102
and until you were
on the stairs,

1:33:50.104 --> 1:33:52.120
we did not know
that anybody was coming.

1:34:03.767 --> 1:34:05.560
So very kind.

1:34:09.367 --> 1:34:12.376
But you are always kind,
Miss Woodhouse.

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:20.918
Ah, Emma.

1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:22.805
How did you find them?

1:34:22.807 --> 1:34:24.501
Emma has been to call on

1:34:24.503 --> 1:34:26.421
Mrs. and Miss Bates,
Mr. Knightley.

1:34:26.423 --> 1:34:29.335
She is always
so attentive to them.

1:34:30.551 --> 1:34:32.149
I...

1:34:32.151 --> 1:34:35.222
I regret I cannot stay, sir.

1:34:35.224 --> 1:34:37.400
We will miss you
in the evening.

1:34:45.527 --> 1:34:46.965
Goodbye, Emma.

1:35:12.664 --> 1:35:13.847
What has happened?

1:35:15.479 --> 1:35:17.718
Mrs. Churchill is dead.

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:19.542
Dead?

1:35:19.544 --> 1:35:22.389
Yes, we-we always thought
her illness

1:35:22.391 --> 1:35:24.374
was invented, but...

1:35:24.376 --> 1:35:26.229
Emma.

1:35:26.231 --> 1:35:27.989
Frank was here
this very morning

1:35:27.991 --> 1:35:30.806
on the most
extraordinary errand.

1:35:30.808 --> 1:35:33.047
It is impossible
to express our surprise.

1:35:34.711 --> 1:35:36.856
Frank and Jane Fairfax
are engaged.

1:35:38.744 --> 1:35:40.309
What?

1:35:40.311 --> 1:35:42.229
There's been a solemn
engagement between them

1:35:42.231 --> 1:35:43.670
ever since October.

1:35:43.672 --> 1:35:46.327
Formed at Weymouth and kept
a secret from everybody.

1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:49.879
What? Um...

1:35:50.903 --> 1:35:52.278
Engaged?

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:54.198
Before either of them
came to Highbury?

1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:56.342
Secretly engaged.

1:35:56.344 --> 1:35:58.677
Of course,
had his aunt heard of it,

1:35:58.679 --> 1:36:00.469
she would have
cut him off, but...

1:36:00.471 --> 1:36:01.910
It has hurt me, Emma,
very much.

1:36:01.912 --> 1:36:03.863
It has hurt his father equally.

1:36:07.607 --> 1:36:09.590
He sent the pianoforte.

1:36:09.592 --> 1:36:11.447
He has confessed it.

1:36:13.079 --> 1:36:15.029
Emma, you must know

1:36:15.031 --> 1:36:17.111
it was our darling wish.

1:36:18.904 --> 1:36:20.949
Oh, no, no.

1:36:20.951 --> 1:36:22.679
Not for me.

1:36:27.736 --> 1:36:31.125
I'm so very sorry, Harriet.

1:36:31.127 --> 1:36:34.197
But why should you condole me?

1:36:34.199 --> 1:36:38.294
You do not think I care about
Mr. Frank Churchill?

1:36:38.296 --> 1:36:41.877
There was a time,
and not very distant, either,

1:36:41.879 --> 1:36:43.797
when you gave me reason
to believe

1:36:43.799 --> 1:36:45.974
- that you did care about him.
- Him?

1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:49.461
Never.

1:36:49.463 --> 1:36:52.245
Dear Miss Woodhouse,
how could you so mistake me?

1:36:52.247 --> 1:36:54.229
Harriet, wh-what do you mean?

1:36:54.231 --> 1:36:56.149
I should not have
thought it possible

1:36:56.151 --> 1:36:59.414
that you could have
misunderstood me.

1:36:59.416 --> 1:37:02.200
But you told me that
greater things had happened.

1:37:03.959 --> 1:37:06.005
That there had been matches
of greater disparity.

1:37:06.007 --> 1:37:07.797
Those were your very words,
Miss Woodhouse.

1:37:07.799 --> 1:37:09.589
Harriet.

1:37:09.591 --> 1:37:11.829
Let us understand
each other now

1:37:11.831 --> 1:37:14.327
without possibility
of further mistake.

1:37:16.311 --> 1:37:18.485
Are you speaking
of Mr. Knightley?

1:37:18.487 --> 1:37:20.279
Of course.

1:37:22.135 --> 1:37:25.013
- But...
- I thought you knew.

1:37:25.015 --> 1:37:27.350
But the service
Mr. Churchill rendered you

1:37:27.352 --> 1:37:29.078
i-in protecting you
from the gypsies.

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.837
Oh, no.

1:37:30.839 --> 1:37:33.623
It was not the gypsies. No.

1:37:35.063 --> 1:37:38.647
I was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance.

1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:45.109
Of Mr. Knightley's coming
and asking me to dance.

1:37:45.111 --> 1:37:47.480
When Mr. Elton
would not stand up with me.

1:37:50.392 --> 1:37:52.247
Good God.

1:37:54.232 --> 1:37:57.014
And have you any idea
of Mr. Knightley's

1:37:57.016 --> 1:37:58.742
returning your affection?

1:37:58.744 --> 1:38:00.599
I must say that I have.

1:38:02.584 --> 1:38:06.551
He has shown me sweetness
and kindness.

1:38:09.111 --> 1:38:12.662
And at Donwell, he took
great pains to describe to me

1:38:12.664 --> 1:38:16.341
some particulars of the
management of his tenant farms.

1:38:16.343 --> 1:38:19.575
We were interrupted,
but before we were...

1:38:21.559 --> 1:38:23.606
...he seemed almost
to be asking me

1:38:23.608 --> 1:38:26.391
if my affections were engaged.

1:38:27.415 --> 1:38:29.718
Yes, but is it possible

1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:32.630
that he might have been
alluding to Mr. Martin?

1:38:32.632 --> 1:38:35.384
That he might have had
Mr. Martin's interest in view?

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.853
You think of Mr. Knightley
for yourself.

1:38:44.855 --> 1:38:47.447
Harriet.

1:38:48.631 --> 1:38:50.549
I-I do not flatter myself

1:38:50.551 --> 1:38:52.375
with any idea
of his attachment to me.

1:38:55.319 --> 1:38:56.536
Harriet.

1:39:00.151 --> 1:39:03.350
I should have considered it
too great a presumption

1:39:03.352 --> 1:39:05.846
even to think of him
but for you.

1:39:05.848 --> 1:39:07.989
Harriet.

1:39:07.991 --> 1:39:12.597
I know that he is the last man

1:39:12.599 --> 1:39:14.678
who would intentionally give
any woman the idea

1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:18.165
of his feeling more for her
than he does, so...

1:39:18.167 --> 1:39:20.407
if you believe...

1:39:22.264 --> 1:39:23.959
...he loves you...

1:39:26.167 --> 1:39:29.592
I refused Mr. Martin
because of you.

1:39:32.056 --> 1:39:34.423
Because...

1:39:35.767 --> 1:39:36.920
Harriet.

1:40:12.472 --> 1:40:14.104
Emma!

1:40:25.687 --> 1:40:27.319
Mr. Knightley.

1:40:32.407 --> 1:40:34.069
Have you heard the news?

1:40:34.071 --> 1:40:35.541
Miss Fairfax
and Frank Churchill.

1:40:35.543 --> 1:40:37.334
I did not see it.

1:40:37.336 --> 1:40:39.765
But then I seem to have been
doomed to blindness.

1:40:39.767 --> 1:40:41.781
Time, my dearest Emma...
time will heal the wound.

1:40:41.783 --> 1:40:43.637
He will soon be gone.

1:40:43.639 --> 1:40:45.014
You will forget him.

1:40:45.016 --> 1:40:48.791
You are very kind,
but you are mistaken.

1:40:50.391 --> 1:40:51.830
My blindness
to what was going on

1:40:51.832 --> 1:40:54.645
led me to act in a way that
I must always be ashamed of,

1:40:54.647 --> 1:40:57.365
but I have no other regret.

1:40:57.367 --> 1:41:00.245
With respect to...

1:41:00.247 --> 1:41:02.135
Mr. Churchill.

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:06.198
He is a disgrace
to the name of man.

1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:08.885
And is he to be rewarded
with that sweet young woman?

1:41:08.887 --> 1:41:12.760
Jane, Jane...
you'll be a miserable creature.

1:41:14.903 --> 1:41:16.565
Everything turns out
for his good.

1:41:16.567 --> 1:41:19.189
His-his aunt is in the way,
his aunt dies.

1:41:19.191 --> 1:41:20.534
He uses everybody ill,

1:41:20.536 --> 1:41:22.965
and-and-and they're delighted
to forgive him.

1:41:22.967 --> 1:41:25.079
He is a fortunate man, indeed.

1:41:26.807 --> 1:41:28.214
You speak as if you envied him.

1:41:28.216 --> 1:41:31.158
And I do envy him.

1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:34.005
Emma.

1:41:34.007 --> 1:41:37.847
In one respect,
he is the object of my envy.

1:41:47.512 --> 1:41:49.238
You will not ask me why.

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:51.254
You are... you-you are...

1:41:51.256 --> 1:41:54.198
you are determined, I see,
to have no curiosity.

1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:56.629
You are wise.

1:41:56.631 --> 1:41:58.101
But I cannot be wise.

1:41:58.103 --> 1:42:01.365
I must tell you, Emma,
what you will not ask,

1:42:01.367 --> 1:42:02.870
though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.

1:42:02.872 --> 1:42:04.727
Oh, then do not speak it.

1:42:17.464 --> 1:42:20.085
If you wish to speak to me...

1:42:20.087 --> 1:42:21.717
as a friend

1:42:21.719 --> 1:42:23.990
or to ask my opinion...

1:42:23.992 --> 1:42:25.653
as a friend,

1:42:25.655 --> 1:42:27.317
I will hear whatever you like.

1:42:27.319 --> 1:42:29.558
"As a friend." Emma, that,
I fear, is a word...

1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:32.502
Tell me, Emma.

1:42:32.504 --> 1:42:35.159
Have I no chance
of ever succeeding?

1:42:36.184 --> 1:42:37.461
My dearest Emma,

1:42:37.463 --> 1:42:39.381
for dearest you will always be,

1:42:39.383 --> 1:42:41.942
my dearest, most beloved Emma,
tell me at once.

1:42:41.944 --> 1:42:44.118
I cannot make speeches.

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:45.974
If I...

1:42:45.976 --> 1:42:47.573
If I... if I loved you less,

1:42:47.575 --> 1:42:50.102
then I might be able
to talk about it more,

1:42:50.104 --> 1:42:51.830
but y-y-you-you...

1:42:51.832 --> 1:42:53.462
you know what I am.

1:42:53.464 --> 1:42:56.405
I have... I have lectured you,

1:42:56.407 --> 1:42:59.510
and I've...
I've blamed you, and...

1:42:59.512 --> 1:43:02.037
and you have borne it
as no other woman in England

1:43:02.039 --> 1:43:03.381
could have borne it.

1:43:03.383 --> 1:43:06.102
God knows I have been
a very indifferent lover.

1:43:06.104 --> 1:43:07.605
But you understand me.

1:43:07.607 --> 1:43:09.463
You-you understand my feelings.

1:43:15.287 --> 1:43:16.567
Will you marry me?

1:43:20.087 --> 1:43:21.173
Oh.

1:43:21.175 --> 1:43:22.262
Emma.

1:43:22.264 --> 1:43:24.949
Oh.

1:43:24.951 --> 1:43:26.229
Emma.

1:43:26.231 --> 1:43:28.757
- Oh.
- Emma.

1:43:28.759 --> 1:43:29.781
Oh.

1:43:29.783 --> 1:43:31.094
- Emma.
- Uh, no, I...

1:43:31.096 --> 1:43:32.693
- Emma.
- Oh.

1:43:32.695 --> 1:43:34.902
No, I...

1:43:34.904 --> 1:43:37.397
I...

1:43:37.399 --> 1:43:39.317
I-I cannot.

1:43:39.319 --> 1:43:40.629
Why not?

1:43:40.631 --> 1:43:41.685
Harriet!

1:43:41.687 --> 1:43:43.478
- Harriet? Wh...
- She's in love with you!

1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:45.494
And she believes that you may love her, too.

1:43:45.496 --> 1:43:48.245
And... and you danced with her!

1:43:48.247 --> 1:43:50.262
- Oh. Oh.
- And shown her kindness

1:43:50.264 --> 1:43:53.013
and took notice of her
at Donwell

1:43:53.015 --> 1:43:55.864
and spoke of farming and...

1:43:58.551 --> 1:43:59.958
And seemed on the verge
of asking

1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:01.461
if her affections were engaged!

1:44:01.463 --> 1:44:03.413
To Robert Martin!
To Robert Martin!

1:44:03.415 --> 1:44:04.565
She told you this?

1:44:04.567 --> 1:44:07.221
I cannot break her heart again.

1:44:07.223 --> 1:44:09.525
I shall... I shall
call on Robert Martin

1:44:09.527 --> 1:44:10.997
this very evening.

1:44:10.999 --> 1:44:12.213
I shall urge him
to put his suit

1:44:12.215 --> 1:44:13.845
to Miss Smith a second time.

1:44:13.847 --> 1:44:15.222
He still loves her.
I'm certain that he does.

1:44:15.224 --> 1:44:16.502
He need only ask again.

1:44:16.504 --> 1:44:18.005
Not-not by letter,
but in person.

1:44:18.007 --> 1:44:20.757
No.

1:44:20.759 --> 1:44:22.807
No, I must do it.

1:44:26.519 --> 1:44:28.247
I must go.

1:45:09.976 --> 1:45:11.831
Mr. Martin...

1:45:13.559 --> 1:45:15.415
...I have a confession to make.

1:45:17.271 --> 1:45:20.405
I have caused you
great suffering.

1:45:20.407 --> 1:45:23.224
As I have also caused
the suffering of my friend.

1:45:25.432 --> 1:45:28.055
My dearest friend.
