01:01.302 --> 01:04.513
POLAND, 1944

01:04.888 --> 01:07.642
(Rain falling, people shouting)

01:11.854 --> 01:14.524
(Guards shouting orders)

01:27.370 --> 01:28.413
(Boy crying)

01:31.082 --> 01:32.125
(Mother shouting)

01:41.134 --> 01:43.887
(Boy screaming)

01:55.607 --> 01:56.649
(Gate creaking)

02:14.292 --> 02:17.295
(Thunder in distance)

02:18.421 --> 02:22.467
Westchester, New York 1944

02:32.769 --> 02:36.231
(Clock ticking)

02:41.611 --> 02:42.654
(Plates rattling)

02:48.868 --> 02:51.454
Mother, what are you...

02:52.121 --> 02:53.957
I thought you were a burglar.

02:54.582 --> 02:57.669
I didn't mean to scare you darling,
I was just getting a snack.

02:57.752 --> 02:59.087
Go back to bed.

03:00.505 --> 03:01.881
What's the matter?

03:02.632 --> 03:04.217
Go on, back to bed.

03:06.469 --> 03:08.721
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

03:09.347 --> 03:10.848
Who are you?

03:15.103 --> 03:17.105
And what have you done with my mother?

03:17.230 --> 03:21.150
(Charles' Mentally speaking)
**My  mother has never set foot
in this kitchen in her life.**

03:22.151 --> 03:25.029
**And she certainly wouldn't have made me
hot chocolate.**

03:25.572 --> 03:28.616
**Unless she kept ordering me to do it.**

03:46.509 --> 03:49.053
You're not scared of me?

03:49.053 --> 03:52.390
I always believed I couldn't be the
only one in the world.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.101
The only person who is...

03:55.101 --> 03:56.936
...different.

03:58.354 --> 04:02.108
And here you are,
Charles Xavier.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.279
Raven.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.824
You're hungry, and alone?

04:09.824 --> 04:11.409
Take whatever you want.

04:11.409 --> 04:13.953
We've got lots of food,
you don't have to steal.

04:15.038 --> 04:16.247
In fact...

04:17.749 --> 04:20.418
...you never have to steal again.

04:29.510 --> 04:31.804
(Music playing on Victrola)

04:33.181 --> 04:35.767
Understand this, Eric.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.479
These Nazi's I'm not like them.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.736
Genes are the key, yes?

04:47.195 --> 04:49.072
But their goals?

04:49.322 --> 04:54.285
Blue eyes, Blonde hair, pathetic.

04:55.954 --> 04:56.996
Mmm.

04:59.374 --> 05:01.000
Eat the chocolate.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.586
It's good.

05:04.087 --> 05:05.255
Want some?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.259
I want to see my mama.

05:15.765 --> 05:21.980
Genes are the keys that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.

05:22.438 --> 05:25.775
A new future for mankind.

05:26.109 --> 05:27.819
Evolution.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.322
You know what I'm talking about?

05:32.615 --> 05:36.160
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

05:36.327 --> 05:41.791
A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.710
Is it.

05:54.137 --> 05:55.179
Yes.

05:58.808 --> 06:01.060
I've tried, Herr Doctor.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.522
I can't...I don't...

06:05.648 --> 06:07.191
It's impossible.

06:09.485 --> 06:15.116
The only thing I can say for the Nazi's.
is their methods seem to produce results.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.993
(Shaw making tsking sounds)

06:17.702 --> 06:19.662
I'm sorry, Erik.

06:20.955 --> 06:21.998
(Bell rings)

06:30.465 --> 06:31.507
Mama.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.052
My darling.
(Door slams)

06:34.510 --> 06:36.429
How are you?

06:40.183 --> 06:42.101
Here's what we're going to do.

06:42.852 --> 06:45.146
I'm going to count to three.

06:46.064 --> 06:49.192
And you're going to move the coin.

06:49.651 --> 06:54.364
You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.

06:56.199 --> 06:58.076
Understand?

06:59.410 --> 07:00.453
One.

07:01.621 --> 07:02.664
Mama.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.165
You can do it.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.338
Two.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.968
Everything is good.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.514
(Panting)

07:25.395 --> 07:26.896
Mother: Everything is good.

07:28.898 --> 07:30.483
Everything is good.

07:31.109 --> 07:32.151
Three.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.780
(Gun shot)
(Bullet casing rattles on desk)

07:49.586 --> 07:50.628
(Metal groaning)

07:53.381 --> 07:55.466
Yes, wonderful!

07:56.050 --> 07:58.428
(Roars with rage)

08:05.435 --> 08:06.477
Excellent.

08:11.691 --> 08:12.734
(Metal rattling)

08:34.714 --> 08:35.756
Noooo.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.432
(Starts crying)

08:46.809 --> 08:48.436
(Quietly sobbing)

08:50.980 --> 08:52.815
Outstanding, Erik.

08:54.025 --> 08:57.779
So we unlocked your gift with anger.

08:58.696 --> 09:02.492
Anger and pain.

09:04.536 --> 09:06.037
Shaw: You and me.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.166
We're going to have a lot of fun together.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.800
Geneva, Switzerland - 1962

10:13.354 --> 10:16.691
Oxford University, England

10:23.364 --> 10:25.408
Hetro-chromia.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.079
A gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first.

10:30.079 --> 10:34.042
(Chuckles) Newman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.461
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.338
The name's, Xavier,
Charles Xavier.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.547
- How do you do...
- Amy.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.633
Hetrochromia, is in reference to your eyes,

10:41.716 --> 10:44.093
which I have to say are stunning.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.554
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.

10:46.596 --> 10:48.097
It's a very groovy mutation.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.559
I've got news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.

10:51.559 --> 10:54.896
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her, deformed.

10:55.104 --> 10:57.315
How is that seduction tactic working for you?

10:57.398 --> 10:58.900
I'll tell you in the morning.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.694
No, seriously though, you mustn’t knock it.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.571
Mutation's go from single cell organisms

11:03.696 --> 11:07.033
to being the dominate form of
reproductive life, on this planet.

11:07.116 --> 11:10.245
Infinite forms of variations with each generation.

11:10.411 --> 11:13.540
All through, mutation.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.709
Then let's reclaim that word.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.882
- Mutant, and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.592
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.

11:24.676 --> 11:25.927
I'm sorry, one cola.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.303
Charles here was just telling me that I'm

11:27.303 --> 11:29.514
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.932
Tiny bit sexier.

11:31.474 --> 11:33.351
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.

11:34.435 --> 11:37.522
-Hi, Amy.
-And what do you study?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.941
- Waitressing.
- Aah.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.737
Oh look, you have hetero-chromia too!

11:44.821 --> 11:47.031
- Say, what?
- Look at her eye..

11:49.868 --> 11:52.495
(Clears throat)
Right, Raven get your coat please.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.164
Charles: Don't talk to me, you did
that on purpose.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.541
- Raven: I did not!
- Charles: Yes you did!

11:56.624 --> 11:59.127
Raven: Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.297
- Raven: When I'm stressed or tired..
- Charles: You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.841
"Mutant and proud"

12:04.924 --> 12:08.428
Why is it always the pretty mutations,
or invisible ones like yours.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.096
If you're a freak, better hide.

12:10.221 --> 12:12.098
You're being ridiculous!

12:12.223 --> 12:14.559
Look, I don't mean to
sound like an old fart.

12:14.642 --> 12:19.230
- Which you are.
- Sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.

12:19.731 --> 12:23.860
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

12:29.407 --> 12:31.743
"Mutant and proud"

12:34.245 --> 12:36.080
"Mutant and proud"?

12:47.091 --> 12:48.927
If only...

12:54.515 --> 12:56.851
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.895
Any young man would be lucky to have you.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.272
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?

13:01.397 --> 13:03.274
Like, you...what?

13:06.861 --> 13:07.987
Blue?

13:10.782 --> 13:13.576
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

13:13.868 --> 13:15.495
Thank you for that.

13:15.912 --> 13:16.913
Well?

13:17.080 --> 13:20.917
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way,
You...I feel responsible for you.

13:21.042 --> 13:24.128
Anything else would just feel...wrong.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.006
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately I do know you.

13:27.131 --> 13:30.426
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.267
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?

13:37.267 --> 13:39.811
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.

13:39.811 --> 13:42.689
Well fine, read about your thesis
it always sends me right off.

13:42.689 --> 13:46.568
To Homo neanderthalensis,
his  mutant cousin Homo sapiens,

13:46.568 --> 13:48.361
was an aberration.

13:48.486 --> 13:51.447
Charles: Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed,

13:51.447 --> 13:52.949
was short lived.

13:53.241 --> 13:57.495
Records show, without exception that the
arrival of the mutated human species

13:57.495 --> 14:02.584
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin.

14:08.923 --> 14:11.759
Man: Possession of this gold is illegal.

14:11.968 --> 14:13.803
I should inform the police.

14:14.137 --> 14:15.889
Let's not play this game.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.974
Where did you get it?

14:18.600 --> 14:19.976
A friend.

14:19.976 --> 14:22.353
He recommended your bank, most highly.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.523
Man: I see.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.692
Do you know our terms, sir?

14:28.318 --> 14:29.360
Yes.

14:30.612 --> 14:33.114
And you should know mine.

14:35.617 --> 14:38.786
This gold is what remains of my people.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.582
Melted from their possessions.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.293
Torn from their teeth.

14:45.501 --> 14:48.630
And you're going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.507
(Tsking)

14:53.843 --> 14:55.637
Don't touch that alarm.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.224
I want Schmidt.

15:01.017 --> 15:02.393
Klaus Schmidt.

15:02.644 --> 15:03.686
Where is he?

15:03.811 --> 15:06.147
Out clients don't provide addresses.
We're  not...

15:06.147 --> 15:07.982
Not that sort of bank?

15:16.533 --> 15:17.867
Metal fillings, eh?

15:17.867 --> 15:18.910
Not gold.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.162
Worried someone might steal them?

15:21.162 --> 15:24.999
Argentina!
Schmidt is in Argentina!

15:25.750 --> 15:28.545
Villa Gesell.
Please, please!

15:38.263 --> 15:41.140
(Panting hard)

15:45.186 --> 15:46.229
Thank you.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.361
I would love to kill you.

15:57.282 --> 15:59.284
So, mark my words.

15:59.742 --> 16:02.662
If you warn anyone I'm coming,

16:04.205 --> 16:05.623
I will find you.

16:09.252 --> 16:13.214
Las Vegas, Nevada

16:18.011 --> 16:20.263
Lavene: Another day at the office.

16:21.097 --> 16:22.682
Moira: Is that Colonel Hendry?

16:23.099 --> 16:25.310
- Lavene: The NATO guy?
- Yeah.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.896
Lavene: Yes it is.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.522
Lavene: 'Cause that's three mob bosses,,

16:29.647 --> 16:32.609
the Italian ambassador
and the CEO of Lockheed.

16:32.901 --> 16:37.322
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.406
(Lavene laughs)

16:38.698 --> 16:43.119
Lavene: Do you see that?
Hello, girls!

16:43.494 --> 16:45.955
Lavene: Wow, very nice.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.541
Wha...what are you doing?

16:48.666 --> 16:51.336
Here's things that the CIA didn't give me.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.629
Stay put.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.467
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:57.592 --> 17:00.637
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associate.

17:01.596 --> 17:03.890
And where is, Mr. Shaw?

17:04.015 --> 17:08.478
We're having a party, and here's the entertainment.
Come with me.

17:08.978 --> 17:10.021
(Palisades Park by Freddy Cannon )

17:10.021 --> 17:12.941
*Down, like a roller coaster*

17:12.941 --> 17:14.358
*Back like a loop-the-loop*

17:14.358 --> 17:17.737
*And around like a merry-go-round*

17:17.737 --> 17:20.240
*We ate and ate at a hot dog stand*

17:20.240 --> 17:23.034
*We danced around to a rockin' band*

17:23.034 --> 17:26.746
*And when I could, I gave that girl a hug*

17:26.746 --> 17:29.290
*In the tunnel of love*

17:29.290 --> 17:31.626
*You'll never know how great a kiss can feel*

17:31.626 --> 17:34.337
*When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel*

17:34.337 --> 17:38.675
*When I fell in love, down at Palisades Park*

17:47.642 --> 17:49.227
Man: Hello beautiful, how are you?

17:49.352 --> 17:51.646
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?

17:51.813 --> 17:55.191
I'm so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.820
Excuse me.

17:58.820 --> 18:00.238
*We ate and ate at a hot dog stand*

18:00.238 --> 18:03.241
*We danced around to a rockin' band*

18:03.241 --> 18:07.078
*And when I could, I gave that girl a hug*

18:07.078 --> 18:09.414
*In the tunnel of love*

18:09.414 --> 18:11.666
*You'll never know how great a kiss can feel*

18:11.708 --> 18:12.709
*When you stop at the....*

18:13.918 --> 18:16.963
(Music playing on record player)

18:19.340 --> 18:22.677
- Are you sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?
- Bob: No.

18:23.261 --> 18:28.308
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

18:30.351 --> 18:34.439
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- Bob: We've had this conversation.

18:34.564 --> 18:38.401
You put our nukes in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia,

18:38.568 --> 18:42.113
and you're looking at war.
Nuclear war.

18:45.742 --> 18:48.536
(Click and whirling sound)

19:15.063 --> 19:18.816
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.

19:18.983 --> 19:26.866
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.

19:26.866 --> 19:32.705
The only thing I will reconsider,
is having another glass of that delicious champagne.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.715
(Sound of wind whistling)

19:44.467 --> 19:47.929
Bob: What the hell did you put in my drink?

19:56.145 --> 19:57.188
(Grunts, loud thud)

20:05.280 --> 20:09.868
Frost: **You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.**

20:10.118 --> 20:13.037
**There's not a fortress in the world
that could keep us out.**

20:29.846 --> 20:32.932
Shaw: Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?

20:33.850 --> 20:37.437
Genetic mutation, the evolution of a human genome.

20:38.146 --> 20:39.439
Where's Azazel?

20:40.023 --> 20:44.444
(High pitched whistle)

20:45.862 --> 20:47.530
Shaw: Ah, we don't want
the Colonel to be late.

20:51.534 --> 20:52.952
Come here.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.541
Man: Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.

20:58.541 --> 20:59.959
We ever decided to fire them,

20:59.959 --> 21:02.587
the Russian early warning system won't
even have time to kick in.

21:02.587 --> 21:04.255
McCone: This better be important, MacTaggert

21:04.255 --> 21:05.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.052
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

21:09.219 --> 21:12.222
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.

21:12.347 --> 21:13.848
Colonel Hendry?

21:14.015 --> 21:17.810
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.

21:17.894 --> 21:21.105
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.

21:21.272 --> 21:22.273
Colonel Hendry is here.

21:22.357 --> 21:26.110
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,

21:26.110 --> 21:29.072
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop
wasting my time.

21:29.239 --> 21:31.991
Looks like Hendry wants to start
World War III.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.910
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.

21:34.244 --> 21:35.453
Sir, I...!

21:37.080 --> 21:38.331
Have you lost your mind?

21:38.915 --> 21:40.833
So, now what?

21:42.293 --> 21:44.921
We find an expert on Genetic Mutation.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.884
Man announcing:
Professor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.681
Raven: So, how does it feel to be a professor?

21:54.681 --> 21:58.226
Charles: Well, don't call me that. You don't get to be called a
Professor until you actually have a teaching position.

21:58.351 --> 22:01.479
- Raven: I know, but it suits you.
- Charles: No, don't say that, do say
"Lets go have a drink".

22:01.604 --> 22:03.398
- Raven: Let's go have a drink.
- Charles: Wonderful!

22:16.619 --> 22:19.706
Villa Gesell, Argentina

22:31.551 --> 22:34.470
- Good evening, my friends!
- Good evening!

22:34.470 --> 22:35.722
- Hot, no?
- Yes...

22:35.722 --> 22:37.682
One beer, please.

22:44.814 --> 22:46.941
(Glass filling)

23:01.331 --> 23:02.582
German beer.

23:02.832 --> 23:03.875
Of course.

23:03.875 --> 23:07.670
Yes, it's Bitburger.
You like it?

23:13.968 --> 23:15.345
The best.

23:20.642 --> 23:22.852
What brings you to Argentina?

23:24.938 --> 23:28.483
The climate, I'm a pig farmer.

23:32.570 --> 23:35.573
Tailor, since I was a boy.

23:36.032 --> 23:38.576
My father made the finest
suits in Düsseldorf.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.788
My parents were from Düsseldorf.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.373
- Ah.
- Yeah.

23:43.706 --> 23:44.916
What was their name?

23:45.250 --> 23:46.793
They didn't have a name.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.505
It was taken away from them.

23:50.964 --> 23:52.340
By pig farmers,...
(Glass clinks)

23:53.633 --> 23:54.926
...and tailors.
(Glass clinks)

24:23.997 --> 24:25.707
Erik: Blood and honor.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.876
Which would you care to shed first?

24:28.084 --> 24:30.086
We were under orders.

24:30.086 --> 24:31.212
Blood then.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.881
(Screams in pain)

24:33.923 --> 24:35.049
Freeze, asshole.

24:35.466 --> 24:36.968
Tailor: Come on, shoot.

24:51.232 --> 24:52.275
(Screams)

24:53.818 --> 24:56.321
(Whimpers in pain)

24:57.155 --> 24:59.532
Who...what are you?

25:02.118 --> 25:04.621
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

25:17.050 --> 25:18.968
I'm looking for my creator.

25:23.973 --> 25:29.854
Crowd chanting: Drink, drink, drink!

25:30.688 --> 25:31.731
(Crowd cheers)

25:33.983 --> 25:36.027
(Triumphantly roars)

25:40.573 --> 25:41.616
(Laughs)

25:41.616 --> 25:43.618
Oh, I'm so proud of  you.

25:44.661 --> 25:47.580
I need another drink, and you
need another cola.

25:51.668 --> 25:55.380
- Congratulations, Professor!
- Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually..

25:55.505 --> 25:57.966
- No, on your presentation.
- You knew my presentation?

25:58.091 --> 25:59.425
How nice of you, thank you very much.

25:59.551 --> 26:01.177
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Charles Xavier.

26:01.177 --> 26:01.970
Do you have a minute?

26:02.220 --> 26:06.516
For a pretty little beam with a
mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.

26:06.933 --> 26:11.229
I say, MCR-1, you would say,
golden hair.

26:11.396 --> 26:15.024
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.

26:15.149 --> 26:19.696
Mutation you know, took us from single
celled organisms,

26:19.863 --> 26:21.614
to the dominate form...

26:21.739 --> 26:25.910
You know what, this routine may go over great
with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.

26:26.202 --> 26:28.663
- What?
- I really need your help.

26:29.414 --> 26:30.707
All right.

26:30.832 --> 26:34.168
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis.

26:34.335 --> 26:36.796
I need to know if they may have already happened.

26:38.047 --> 26:40.008
In people alive today.

26:44.804 --> 26:45.847
(No sound)

26:51.352 --> 26:52.604
Professor?

26:54.731 --> 26:56.232
I think we should just talk when you're sober.

26:56.357 --> 26:57.734
Do you have any time tomorrow?

26:59.319 --> 27:03.239
Something tells me, you already know
the answer to your question.

27:05.283 --> 27:06.659
This is very important to me.

27:06.743 --> 27:09.370
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

27:10.246 --> 27:11.122
Thank you.

27:11.372 --> 27:14.500
Miami, Florida

27:14.751 --> 27:18.379
- Shaw: Still drinking champagne, Bob?
- Bob: I will pass.

27:19.172 --> 27:22.133
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.137
I was wondering, who you told
about our little arrangement?

27:26.512 --> 27:27.805
No one.

27:30.350 --> 27:32.518
- He's telling the truth.
- Shaw: Good.

27:32.644 --> 27:36.689
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

27:40.735 --> 27:43.446
Bob: Well I knew better than to trust you.

27:44.197 --> 27:47.659
Now you let me walk out of here
with my money.

27:47.659 --> 27:51.746
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.

27:52.622 --> 27:55.625
Go ahead, pull it.

27:55.625 --> 27:57.293
I'll do it, I swear to god.

28:07.095 --> 28:08.513
No you won't.

28:13.643 --> 28:14.936
But I will.

28:28.157 --> 28:29.367
You're one of them?

28:29.450 --> 28:33.288
Shaw: Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?

28:33.413 --> 28:36.291
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

28:36.457 --> 28:37.959
That's the boring part.

28:38.084 --> 28:41.713
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I got it.

28:48.052 --> 28:50.013
CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VIRGINIA
The advent of the nuclear age,
may have accelerated the mutation process.

28:50.013 --> 28:52.432
may have accelerated the mutation process.

28:52.432 --> 28:57.353
Individual's with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.230
Thank you very much.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.983
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist,

29:01.983 --> 29:05.570
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men?

29:05.695 --> 29:08.448
You just brought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool.

29:08.698 --> 29:10.158
This meeting is over.

29:10.325 --> 29:12.744
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.

29:13.703 --> 29:16.247
I didn't really expect you to believe me.

29:16.247 --> 29:18.124
Given that all you could think about during my presentation,

29:18.249 --> 29:20.835
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.796
It's apple pecan.

29:24.088 --> 29:26.424
I haven't been entirely honest with you, luv, I'm sorry.

29:26.507 --> 29:30.470
You see, one of the many spectacular things my
mutation allows me to do.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.472
Is that I can read your  mind.

29:32.931 --> 29:34.515
I've seen this before in a magic show.

29:34.682 --> 29:38.478
Are you going to ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now?

29:39.312 --> 29:40.230
No, Agent Stryker.

29:40.355 --> 29:43.733
Although I could ask  you about your son William who
you were thinking about,

29:43.858 --> 29:45.109
which is very nice.

29:45.235 --> 29:47.320
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter...

29:47.445 --> 29:50.031
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.

29:51.908 --> 29:54.619
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!

29:54.744 --> 29:56.663
I did not, I would never bring one here!

30:15.723 --> 30:17.392
How's that for a magic trick?

30:20.562 --> 30:22.897
Best I've ever seen.

30:23.481 --> 30:24.941
I want them out of here.

30:25.108 --> 30:28.278
And lock down until I can figure out
what to do.

30:29.237 --> 30:33.533
My facility is off site. I'll take them.

30:35.201 --> 30:35.994
I can't believe this.

30:36.077 --> 30:38.538
You'd think the director of the CIA
would have a little more composure.

30:38.663 --> 30:40.039
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...

30:40.164 --> 30:42.166
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.501
What are we doing to do, Lavene?

30:44.127 --> 30:47.130
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?

30:49.507 --> 30:53.344
Charles: **Absolutely nothing, I've just frozen him for the
moment because I'd like to talk to you.**

30:53.428 --> 30:54.637
**It's good, isn't it?**

30:54.637 --> 30:57.557
**I'm as interested in this,
Sebastian Shaw as you are,**

30:57.557 --> 31:00.685
**...and if you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.**

31:01.936 --> 31:04.689
Man in Black: I've always known that
there were people like you out there.

31:04.814 --> 31:08.318
I've been the laughing stock of this agency
for years but I knew it.

31:08.401 --> 31:09.485
You're going to love my facility.

31:09.569 --> 31:11.362
- Charles: That's going to have to wait.
- Man in Black: Why?

31:11.487 --> 31:13.406
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw,

31:13.531 --> 31:15.825
and if we don't move now apparently
we're going to loose him.

31:15.992 --> 31:16.701
What?

31:16.826 --> 31:19.996
Not only can he read minds,
he can communicate with them as well.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.873
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.

31:21.998 --> 31:23.917
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!

31:24.167 --> 31:25.210
(Charles chuckles)

31:25.251 --> 31:28.504
But I cannot take you anywhere else,
without permission from upstairs.

31:28.588 --> 31:30.757
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.467
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

31:53.738 --> 31:54.989
Herr Doctor...

31:59.285 --> 32:01.371
Little Erik Lehnsherr.

32:01.621 --> 32:03.122
He's here to kill you.

32:04.624 --> 32:05.959
(Screeching sound)

32:10.129 --> 32:12.840
What kind of greeting is that?

32:15.134 --> 32:17.011
...after all these years.

32:17.971 --> 32:19.013
(Gun shot)

32:26.729 --> 32:29.190
Emma... (tsking sound)

32:29.190 --> 32:31.234
We don't harm our own kind.

32:31.234 --> 32:32.777
(Boat horn blaring)

32:33.069 --> 32:35.363
Shaw: Ah, now it's a party.

32:36.406 --> 32:41.035
(Man on bullhorn) This is the US Coast guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.

32:41.202 --> 32:42.996
Stay where you are.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.503
They have a telepath.

32:54.507 --> 32:55.800
I've lost, Shaw!

32:56.134 --> 32:57.844
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.

32:57.844 --> 33:00.763
There, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.

33:00.763 --> 33:02.557
I think there's someone like
me on that ship.

33:02.724 --> 33:05.518
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.646
This is incredible, I can actually feel
her inside my mind.

33:08.646 --> 33:10.565
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be much help to you tonight.

33:10.690 --> 33:11.691
You're on your own.

33:19.866 --> 33:20.909
(Winds whistling)

33:25.455 --> 33:26.956
- Oh my god.
- Moria: Jesus.

33:30.460 --> 33:31.461
Man in Black: Get inside.

33:35.673 --> 33:36.716
(Chains rattle)

33:37.717 --> 33:39.052
Stop, stop, stop!

33:39.844 --> 33:42.764
Charles!
You okay?

33:42.889 --> 33:44.390
There's someone else out there.

33:48.353 --> 33:49.646
There!

33:51.397 --> 33:52.440
(Anchor creaks)

33:52.524 --> 33:53.733
Time to go.

34:48.955 --> 34:50.331
Charles: Let go!

34:52.250 --> 34:53.710
Charles: You got to let it go!

34:53.793 --> 34:55.628
You've got help him...there's
someone in the water, help him!

34:55.712 --> 34:59.173
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

35:18.985 --> 35:22.405
Charles: **You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.**

35:22.488 --> 35:25.200
**I know what this means to you
but you're going to die.**

35:25.491 --> 35:29.537
**Please, Erik, calm your mind.**

35:40.965 --> 35:42.508
Erik: Get off of me, get off!

35:42.634 --> 35:44.844
Calm down, please.
We're here!

35:44.969 --> 35:46.971
- Who are you?
-  My name's Charles Xavier.

35:47.096 --> 35:48.973
You were in my head.

35:49.265 --> 35:50.600
How did you do that?

35:50.725 --> 35:52.018
You have your tricks, I have mine.

35:52.143 --> 35:54.562
I'm like you, just calm your mind.

35:56.940 --> 36:00.777
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.615
Erik, you're not alone.

36:08.451 --> 36:12.038
Covert CIA Research Base

36:26.010 --> 36:28.012
Man in Black: Welcome to my facility.

36:28.888 --> 36:30.431
My mission has been to investigate the

36:30.515 --> 36:34.018
application of paranormal powers
for military defense.

36:34.143 --> 36:35.436
Or offense.

36:35.728 --> 36:38.815
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever
you want to call him.

36:38.982 --> 36:40.650
He's working with the Russians.

36:40.775 --> 36:42.318
We might need your help to stop him.

36:42.443 --> 36:43.319
Marvelous.

36:43.444 --> 36:46.155
So we're to be the CIA's new
mutant division, yes?

36:47.365 --> 36:48.575
Something like that.

36:52.245 --> 36:56.499
Hank: It's a supersonic. The most
advanced plane ever built.

36:57.792 --> 37:00.879
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

37:00.962 --> 37:04.841
Hank, these are the special new recruits I
was telling you about.

37:04.966 --> 37:05.925
This is, Hank McCoy,

37:06.050 --> 37:08.011
One of our most talented young researchers.

37:08.136 --> 37:11.723
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.

37:11.848 --> 37:14.559
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?

37:15.810 --> 37:17.395
Because you don't know.

37:18.188 --> 37:21.316
I am so, so terribly sorry!

37:23.985 --> 37:25.111
Hank?

37:25.236 --> 37:27.238
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

37:27.739 --> 37:31.159
So  your mutation's what?
You're super smart?

37:31.284 --> 37:34.495
Charles: I'll say, Hank here graduated
honors at the age of fifteen.

37:35.288 --> 37:37.415
I wish that's all it was.

37:37.582 --> 37:41.127
You're among friends now, Hank.
You could show off.

37:53.181 --> 37:54.224
(Charles laughs with joy)

37:57.143 --> 37:58.353
Splendid.

38:04.108 --> 38:06.319
- Sorry.
- Charles: Yes, yes.

38:09.864 --> 38:10.907
(All laugh)

38:20.708 --> 38:23.878
- You're amazing.
- Really?

38:29.217 --> 38:32.679
TV Announcer: The presence of U.S. missiles in Turkey
represents an unprecedented threat

38:32.762 --> 38:34.430
to the people of the Soviet Union.

38:34.556 --> 38:38.226
Warned Russian Mister Gromeko, earlier today

38:38.476 --> 38:43.731
But he was quick to insist the Russians
would not be the first to initiate any military action.

38:43.898 --> 38:46.192
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as
we get to Russia.

38:46.818 --> 38:50.989
- Unless the CIA finds us first.
- I'll take care of them too.

38:52.240 --> 38:57.287
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

38:57.745 --> 38:59.664
Already in hand, my love.

39:09.382 --> 39:10.800
Shaw: The Russians...

39:13.219 --> 39:14.679
...made me this.

39:18.099 --> 39:20.685
So, what am I thinking?

39:30.195 --> 39:31.613
I don't know.

39:34.365 --> 39:38.328
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite
thing I've ever seen in my life.

39:42.457 --> 39:44.876
And that this needs ice.
(Taps glass)

39:45.877 --> 39:47.170
Shaw: Fetch me some.

39:47.253 --> 39:48.671
There's a good girl.

39:56.638 --> 39:59.098
(Radar pinging)

40:14.280 --> 40:18.493
Hank: I...I promised myself I'd find a cure.
Ever since I was a little boy.

40:18.618 --> 40:22.372
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...

40:22.914 --> 40:24.707
- ...normal.
- Normal.

40:29.254 --> 40:31.548
Charles has never understood.

40:31.839 --> 40:35.218
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

40:35.927 --> 40:40.139
Hank this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

40:40.181 --> 40:42.934
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.

40:43.101 --> 40:44.269
Yeah.

40:45.061 --> 40:46.813
Do you think it would work on me?

40:48.147 --> 40:50.483
I can look into it, if you'd like.

40:50.483 --> 40:54.112
That's the least I can do after asking you to
come down here with such a weird request.

40:54.279 --> 40:55.029
I have to admit,

40:55.113 --> 40:57.782
usually when guys ask me out they're
not after my blood.

40:58.491 --> 41:04.372
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.

41:04.497 --> 41:06.624
You know, the nature of your mutation.

41:06.749 --> 41:09.961
If any genes hold the key to changing appearance,
it's yours.

41:10.086 --> 41:14.507
Hank, you aren't being forward,
that's kinda what I meant.

41:15.008 --> 41:20.513
- No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
- And I'm sorry that you weren't.

41:22.015 --> 41:24.475
Go ahead, take the blood.

41:36.362 --> 41:38.156
Sorry, did I hurt you?

41:40.617 --> 41:41.784
Kinky!

41:43.745 --> 41:49.500
By the way, if I looked like you,
I wouldn't change a thing.

42:16.069 --> 42:20.281
Charles: What I know about you, I'm surprised
you've managed to stay this long.

42:21.783 --> 42:25.286
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.

42:25.537 --> 42:27.539
Then you know to stay out of my head.

42:27.664 --> 42:31.209
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what
Shaw did to you.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.129
I felt your agony.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.175
I can help you.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.763
(Tiredly exhales)

42:45.765 --> 42:47.225
I don't need your help.

42:47.350 --> 42:49.435
Charles: Don't kid yourself.
You needed my help last night.

42:49.561 --> 42:51.729
It's not just me you're walking away from.

42:52.438 --> 42:56.609
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

42:59.153 --> 43:02.115
I won't stop you leaving, I could.

43:05.410 --> 43:06.744
But I won't.

43:10.790 --> 43:12.333
Charles: Shaw's got friends.

43:13.042 --> 43:14.669
Charles: You could do with some.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.761
Man in Black: Hank turned that
radar installation into a transmitter.

43:23.887 --> 43:26.014
It's designed to amplify brain waves,

43:26.139 --> 43:28.558
...so it could enhance your telepathic powers.

43:28.725 --> 43:31.144
Help us find other mutants for our division.

43:31.227 --> 43:33.271
What if they don't want to be found by you?

43:33.354 --> 43:34.856
Erik.

43:35.315 --> 43:36.858
You decided to stay.

43:39.402 --> 43:43.156
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

43:43.448 --> 43:46.117
Charles and I find the mutants,
no suits.

43:46.284 --> 43:47.952
First of all, that's my machine out there.

43:48.077 --> 43:49.329
Second of all, and much more importantly,

43:49.454 --> 43:50.997
this is Charles' decision.

43:51.122 --> 43:54.000
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.
Isn't that right?

43:55.752 --> 43:59.839
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.

43:59.923 --> 44:02.383
Charles: We'll find them alone.

44:03.885 --> 44:05.220
What if I say no?

44:06.387 --> 44:09.265
Then good luck using your installation without me.

44:21.653 --> 44:23.988
Hank: I call it, Cerebro.

44:25.573 --> 44:27.659
- Charles: Isn't that Spanish for "brain"?
- Hank: Yes.

44:28.201 --> 44:31.663
Okay so, the electrodes connect
Charles to the transmitter on the roof.

44:31.663 --> 44:33.540
And picks up a mutant.

44:33.665 --> 44:35.750
His brain sends a signal through a relay.

44:35.917 --> 44:38.461
And then the co-ordinates of their
location are printed out here.

44:38.795 --> 44:41.756
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

44:44.926 --> 44:47.929
- What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
- Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

44:48.930 --> 44:51.558
I've been a lab rat, I know one when I see one.

44:51.683 --> 44:53.726
Okay, right...

44:54.227 --> 44:56.938
- Are you sure we can't shave your head?
- Don't touch my hair.

45:10.827 --> 45:11.870
(Computer clicking and whirling)

45:19.502 --> 45:20.545
(Gasps)

45:20.795 --> 45:21.838
(Pants)

45:32.348 --> 45:33.391
(Laughs)

45:41.441 --> 45:42.525
It's working!

45:43.484 --> 45:44.527
(Laughs with joy)

45:49.073 --> 45:52.493
*60's dance music*

46:00.543 --> 46:03.379
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.

46:06.466 --> 46:09.510
(Glasses ring)
You cat's know it's double for both, right?

46:10.345 --> 46:12.680
No, that won't be necessary.
although I'm sure we...

46:12.805 --> 46:15.350
We were thinking, we'll show you ours,

46:15.558 --> 46:17.393
...if you show us yours.

46:17.519 --> 46:19.854
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.

46:22.106 --> 46:25.485
- More tea, Vicar?
- Charles: Don't mind if I do.

46:27.946 --> 46:29.405
My turn.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.209
(Wings fluttering)

46:47.340 --> 46:49.801
How would you like a job, where you
get to keep your clothes on?

46:55.723 --> 46:58.017
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.

46:58.142 --> 47:01.145
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?

47:01.229 --> 47:04.148
No we were rather hoping you would
take us all the way.

47:04.148 --> 47:05.900
That's a six hour drive.

47:05.900 --> 47:07.694
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

47:12.365 --> 47:15.076
Prison warden: What the hell does the government want
with a guy like, Alex Summers?

47:15.243 --> 47:17.370
I hope you're not planning on putting him with others.

47:17.495 --> 47:21.124
First guy I ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

47:31.259 --> 47:33.428
- Sean: Crazy, huh?
- Girl: What?

47:34.262 --> 47:36.472
Sean: You like fish, I like fish too.

47:36.472 --> 47:39.601
Maybe we should get a bite
some time and talk about it.

47:42.020 --> 47:44.022
I'd rather go out with the fish.

47:50.195 --> 47:51.696
These fish?

48:10.715 --> 48:12.842
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lehnsherr.
- Charles Xavier.

48:12.926 --> 48:14.510
Go fuck yourselves.

48:34.531 --> 48:36.866
- There's nothing on radar?
- No.

48:36.950 --> 48:38.618
- Sonar?
- Nyet.

48:39.869 --> 48:41.454
Then we have a problem.

48:50.338 --> 48:51.381
(Door sliding open)

49:00.431 --> 49:02.350
Beautiful, isn't it?

49:02.976 --> 49:07.689
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.

49:07.814 --> 49:09.482
We have a situation.

49:09.732 --> 49:11.526
The telepath...

49:11.609 --> 49:13.695
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.

49:13.820 --> 49:15.989
It's like his reach is...

49:16.364 --> 49:18.157
...amplified.

49:20.368 --> 49:22.412
They're recruiting.

49:22.871 --> 49:26.082
Shaw: You go on to Russia,
I'll handle him.

49:27.834 --> 49:29.502
Charles: I can't stop thinking
about the others out there.

49:29.502 --> 49:31.921
All those minds that I've touched.

49:32.881 --> 49:38.386
I could feel them, their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

49:38.970 --> 49:41.764
I tell you, we've started something
incredible, Erik.

49:42.307 --> 49:44.934
- We can help them.
- Can we?

49:46.102 --> 49:49.105
Identification, that's how it starts.

49:50.565 --> 49:54.277
Then ends with being rounded up.
Experimented on, eliminated.

49:54.402 --> 49:56.029
Not this time.

49:56.154 --> 49:59.991
We have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians
they need us.

49:59.991 --> 50:01.451
For now.

50:07.123 --> 50:08.791
Raven: We should think of code names.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.085
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

50:11.211 --> 50:15.256
- I want to be called, Mystique.
- Damn, I wanted to be called, Mystique.

50:15.381 --> 50:17.342
- Well tough, I called it.

50:18.843 --> 50:22.138
(Seans voice) Damn right,
I'm more mysterious than you.

50:24.516 --> 50:27.977
- Darwin, what about you?
- Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.

50:28.061 --> 50:32.106
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.

50:32.524 --> 50:33.983
Check this out.

50:42.450 --> 50:44.160
(Whooping and laughing)

50:46.371 --> 50:47.413
(Clapping)

50:47.664 --> 50:49.582
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bravo, bravo.

50:49.916 --> 50:53.044
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...

50:54.254 --> 50:55.129
...Banshee.

50:55.255 --> 50:56.923
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

50:57.006 --> 50:58.716
Sean: You might want to cover your ears.

51:02.262 --> 51:03.930
(Inhales)

51:07.392 --> 51:08.434
(High pitched whistle)

51:11.938 --> 51:12.981
(All laughing)

51:14.649 --> 51:15.441
Your turn.

51:15.608 --> 51:20.280
My uh, stage name is Angel.
Kind of fits.

51:20.405 --> 51:23.867
- You can fly?
-  Ah, hah. And uh...

51:28.037 --> 51:29.080
((Sizzles))

51:33.001 --> 51:36.462
- What's your name?
- How about Big Foot?

51:36.588 --> 51:39.048
Well you know what they say
about guys with big feet?

51:39.424 --> 51:41.593
And uh, yours are kind of small.

51:41.593 --> 51:43.303
Okay, now.

51:44.095 --> 51:46.222
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

51:46.347 --> 51:50.185
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.

51:50.185 --> 51:52.854
- I can't do it in here.
- Can you do it out there?

51:52.854 --> 51:54.230
- Raven: Why don't you just do it out there.
- Angel: Come on.

51:54.230 --> 51:56.608
- Raven: Come on, Alex.
- Alex! Alex!

51:56.608 --> 51:59.736
All chanting: Alex, Alex, Alex.

52:02.322 --> 52:03.781
That's the spirit.

52:03.907 --> 52:05.450
Get down when I tell you.

52:13.249 --> 52:14.542
Get back.

52:19.339 --> 52:20.798
Get back!

52:22.133 --> 52:23.426
Whatever...

52:33.436 --> 52:35.438
(Cheering, clapping)

52:37.232 --> 52:41.486
We've got Intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian defense chief in Moscow.

52:41.486 --> 52:43.363
So go ahead, say it.

52:43.655 --> 52:46.115
I'm not here to say "I told you so",
you know why I'm here.

52:46.616 --> 52:48.785
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring
along your mutants.

52:48.785 --> 52:50.662
Fight fire with fire.

52:51.371 --> 52:52.372
Makes sense.

52:52.497 --> 52:54.457
Wait, you're okay with this?

52:54.541 --> 52:57.335
Sending in a bunch of untrained
unauthorized freaks?

52:57.460 --> 53:01.464
These "Freaks" are dedicated hard working people.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.425
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

53:04.551 --> 53:06.511
I'm telling you these kids
are not ready for, Shaw.

53:06.594 --> 53:09.472
I think they're going to surprise you.
They are an exceptional bunch of young people.

53:09.556 --> 53:10.682
What the hell?

53:14.394 --> 53:16.729
*Chan Romero, The hippy hippy shake*

53:22.777 --> 53:24.654
Harder!

53:25.280 --> 53:26.322
Darwin: Harder!

53:28.575 --> 53:30.827
What are  you doing?

53:36.457 --> 53:39.043
- Who destroyed the statue?
- Hank: It was, Alex.

53:39.752 --> 53:43.214
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok.
That's his name now.

53:43.298 --> 53:46.467
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X

53:46.634 --> 53:49.304
And you should be, Magneto.

53:50.680 --> 53:52.098
Exceptional.

53:56.477 --> 53:58.313
I expect more from you.

54:01.482 --> 54:04.694
Russian Military Retreat

54:15.246 --> 54:16.956
(Knocking)

54:19.209 --> 54:20.210
Driver: We've got a problem.

54:20.335 --> 54:22.837
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.

54:29.427 --> 54:30.887
No matter what happens, act normally.

54:30.970 --> 54:32.430
I'll take care of this, all right.

54:34.015 --> 54:35.225
All right, listen to me..

54:38.019 --> 54:39.062
Where are you going?

54:39.270 --> 54:40.772
To our farm.

54:41.439 --> 54:42.482
(Dog growls and barks)

54:42.690 --> 54:43.733
Open the back.

54:44.108 --> 54:45.652
As you wish, as you wish.

54:46.778 --> 54:49.113
(Dog barking in background)

54:50.573 --> 54:52.742
Oh, easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.

55:08.091 --> 55:10.802
- Guard: Anything back there?
- Nothing, it's empty.

55:14.180 --> 55:15.807
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

55:18.726 --> 55:19.769
(Doors slam shut)

55:39.080 --> 55:40.707
- Where's Shaw?
- I know her.

55:41.457 --> 55:44.586
She's the telepath, and I read her, she'll know we're here.

55:45.837 --> 55:47.839
Let me try something else.

56:05.523 --> 56:08.193
Shaw sends his apologies, but
he's indisposed.

56:08.193 --> 56:09.736
He asked me to come in his place.

56:10.695 --> 56:14.991
But between you and I honey,
I'm a lot better company.

56:15.783 --> 56:17.202
Please come in.

56:21.748 --> 56:23.041
He's not coming.

56:25.460 --> 56:29.214
- So, what now, boss?
- Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.882
- Mission aborted
- The hell it is.

56:31.049 --> 56:33.384
- Erik.
-She's his right hand woman.

56:33.384 --> 56:34.886
That's good enough for me.

56:34.886 --> 56:37.597
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official.

56:37.722 --> 56:40.266
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.

56:41.226 --> 56:42.310
Erik!

56:44.312 --> 56:46.564
(Glasses clink)
To your health.

56:50.652 --> 56:52.612
Frost: So you must be busy
planning your next move.

56:52.737 --> 56:56.199
What with the American's refusing to remove
their missiles from Turkey.

56:57.450 --> 57:00.828
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.

57:01.246 --> 57:02.664
Emma.

57:05.667 --> 57:09.671
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.

57:17.512 --> 57:20.473
(Soldiers shouting)

57:26.354 --> 57:27.981
Driver: He's going to start
world war III single handed.

57:28.064 --> 57:29.983
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

57:30.441 --> 57:32.151
- We're moving out.
- You can't.

57:47.667 --> 57:50.044
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.

57:50.545 --> 57:52.046
(Guards shouts warning)

58:02.098 --> 58:03.349
For goodness sake, Erik...

58:04.142 --> 58:04.726
Be calm.

58:05.185 --> 58:08.771
Be calm.
Forget my face. Yes.

58:13.693 --> 58:14.736
(Speaking Russian)

58:17.864 --> 58:22.035
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.

58:22.619 --> 58:24.078
Pathetic.

58:31.294 --> 58:32.337
You are.

58:36.049 --> 58:37.467
Nice trick.

58:39.677 --> 58:41.054
Who are  you?

58:45.016 --> 58:46.017
Go to sleep.

58:54.317 --> 58:56.778
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.

58:58.696 --> 59:01.616
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

59:14.295 --> 59:16.047
So then you can just tell us.

59:18.466 --> 59:20.093
Where is Shaw?

59:26.558 --> 59:27.684
Erik.

59:34.274 --> 59:35.483
Erik, that's enough.

59:44.242 --> 59:45.910
Erik, that's enough!

59:46.119 --> 59:48.496
(Diamond cracking)

59:55.545 --> 59:56.796
All yours.

59:58.089 --> 01:00:00.216
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.

01:00:01.176 --> 01:00:03.511
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

01:00:22.405 --> 01:00:25.867
(Explosions)

01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:32.248
Shaw: We are the children of the atom.

01:00:32.707 --> 01:00:35.293
Radiation gave birth to mutants.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.631
What will kill the humans,
will only make us stronger.

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:45.845
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.184
This is worse that we previously imagined.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.188
We're taking you with us.

01:00:55.396 --> 01:00:59.025
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.736
Might be other things to worry about right now.

01:01:07.992 --> 01:01:09.827
Alex: Whoa, all right.

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:14.624
- Darwin: Jesus, man you are killing me.
- Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.

01:01:20.213 --> 01:01:22.549
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.

01:01:22.632 --> 01:01:25.218
CIA Agent: Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...
(Making fluttering sounds)

01:01:25.385 --> 01:01:29.681
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot let's go.

01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:31.724
Hey, hey come on, hey.

01:01:36.396 --> 01:01:38.231
They're just guys being stupid.

01:01:38.523 --> 01:01:41.901
Guy's being stupid I can handle.
Okay, I've handled that my whole life.

01:01:42.026 --> 01:01:44.404
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off,

01:01:44.529 --> 01:01:46.906
then the way these one's stare at me.

01:01:47.866 --> 01:01:49.200
At us.

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.621
(Distant explosion, whooshing sound)

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.166
(Explosion)

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.418
What was that?

01:02:00.628 --> 01:02:02.422
Darwin: I don't know, but
something doesn't feel right.

01:02:06.217 --> 01:02:07.260
(Whooshing)

01:02:11.472 --> 01:02:15.810
- Man in Black: No news of Shaw?
- Agent: Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.

01:02:16.686 --> 01:02:19.147
(Explosion, whooshing)

01:02:29.115 --> 01:02:30.325
What is that?

01:02:31.409 --> 01:02:32.452
(Screams in fear)

01:02:33.161 --> 01:02:34.204
(Screams)

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:39.709
(Bodies thudding on ground)

01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:40.877
Agent: Ahhhh.
(Glass shatters)

01:02:48.051 --> 01:02:49.636
We have an intruder on the main atrium.

01:02:49.886 --> 01:02:52.514
- Shaw: Where are the mutants?
- You take another step, I'm going to put you down.

01:02:52.722 --> 01:02:55.266
Of course you will, but where do I find
the more evolved people?

01:02:57.018 --> 01:02:58.102
Send back-up now!

01:03:01.356 --> 01:03:03.900
Get back, get back, do not leave that room.
We're under attack.

01:03:04.234 --> 01:03:06.277
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

01:03:06.444 --> 01:03:07.487
(Machine gun fire)

01:03:10.949 --> 01:03:11.991
(Glass shatters, bullets ricochet)

01:03:14.244 --> 01:03:16.496
(Tornado whistling)

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:21.209
Shaw: Where are the mutants?

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:23.461
Agent: Put that man down or we will open fire.

01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:51.531
Stay here my ass.
Let's go!

01:03:56.744 --> 01:03:58.580
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.162
(Raven sobbing)

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.307
(Gun fires in hallway,
Raven screams)

01:04:59.724 --> 01:05:02.560
Agent: Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

01:05:02.602 --> 01:05:04.020
Just let us normal people go.

01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:05.605
We're no threa...
(Sound of body falling)

01:05:14.906 --> 01:05:15.823
Shaw: Where's the telepath?

01:05:16.658 --> 01:05:18.368
- Not here.
- To bad.

01:05:19.202 --> 01:05:20.912
Now I can take this silly thing off.

01:05:23.456 --> 01:05:26.251
Good evening
My name's, Sebastian Shaw.

01:05:28.503 --> 01:05:30.797
And I am not here to hurt you.

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.923
Agent: Freeze!

01:05:32.757 --> 01:05:33.633
Azazel...

01:05:37.554 --> 01:05:40.265
My friends, there's a revolution coming.

01:05:40.723 --> 01:05:44.018
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:45.895
Each of us will face a choice.

01:05:46.813 --> 01:05:51.276
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.

01:05:52.277 --> 01:05:54.821
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us,

01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:58.283
then by definition you are against us.

01:05:59.158 --> 01:06:05.164
So, you can stay, and fight for the
people who hate, and fear you.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.211
Or you can join me.
And live like kings.

01:06:16.426 --> 01:06:17.760
And Queens.

01:06:29.564 --> 01:06:31.232
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?

01:06:32.066 --> 01:06:35.236
Come on, we don't belong here.

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:38.072
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:44.662
We have to do something.

01:06:46.748 --> 01:06:47.790
(Broken glass jingles)

01:07:00.512 --> 01:07:03.515
Stop, I'm coming with you.

01:07:07.352 --> 01:07:08.436
Good choice.

01:07:10.104 --> 01:07:12.190
So tell me about your mutation.

01:07:12.941 --> 01:07:14.526
Well, I adapt to survive.

01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:21.157
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.

01:07:28.081 --> 01:07:30.250
- Alex,...............do it!
- Get down!

01:07:36.047 --> 01:07:37.465
Protecting your fellow mutants?

01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:41.928
Shaw: It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.

01:07:48.268 --> 01:07:49.769
Adapt to this.

01:08:20.133 --> 01:08:24.136
Moscow, Russia

01:08:33.897 --> 01:08:34.939
Hello.

01:08:36.608 --> 01:08:44.866
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

01:08:45.491 --> 01:08:47.285
These Americans are ruthless.

01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:52.415
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:58.337
I expect you'll be planning
missile sites of your own.

01:08:58.462 --> 01:09:04.761
Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.

01:09:05.386 --> 01:09:09.640
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:12.852
And so close to Florida.

01:09:13.937 --> 01:09:15.604
Missiles in Cuba?

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:19.526
You're serious?

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:23.154
We may as well declare war.

01:09:24.363 --> 01:09:26.323
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

01:09:28.826 --> 01:09:30.745
You will make this happen.

01:09:33.247 --> 01:09:34.290
Okay.

01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:37.460
Let's see what KGB think about this.

01:09:41.923 --> 01:09:45.051
Hello, General Armivolkoff.

01:09:48.304 --> 01:09:50.098
It's nothing.

01:09:59.899 --> 01:10:03.945
(Tires screech, doors slam)

01:10:06.656 --> 01:10:07.407
Raven.

01:10:13.746 --> 01:10:15.707
Charles: We've made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately.

01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:17.333
- Sean: We're not going home.
- What?

01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:21.296
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed, Darwin.

01:10:21.296 --> 01:10:22.839
Charles: All the more reason for you to leave.

01:10:23.047 --> 01:10:23.965
This is over.

01:10:24.424 --> 01:10:28.511
Darwin's dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.

01:10:31.139 --> 01:10:32.640
We can avenge him.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:37.478
Erik, word please.

01:10:41.524 --> 01:10:44.152
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.

01:10:44.694 --> 01:10:46.863
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

01:10:52.952 --> 01:10:56.122
Charles: We'll have to train.
All of us.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.791
- Yes?
- Yeah.

01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:01.002
Well we can't stay here.

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:03.922
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:06.883
We've got no where to go.

01:11:09.636 --> 01:11:10.845
Yes, we do.

01:11:11.471 --> 01:11:13.264
McCone: The law says we've got to turn her over.

01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:15.600
Stryker: The law applies to human beings.

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:18.937
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're to dangerous.

01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:22.899
Times like this, security is more
important than liberty.

01:11:23.441 --> 01:11:28.112
- There's a war coming, John.
- McCone: Yes, but a war with who?

01:11:35.787 --> 01:11:38.206
(Screech of glass cutting)

01:11:39.749 --> 01:11:40.792
(Tap)

01:11:42.335 --> 01:11:43.545
Excellent question.

01:11:44.587 --> 01:11:46.381
Though I won't call it a war exactly.

01:11:47.423 --> 01:11:50.343
That suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning.

01:12:00.603 --> 01:12:02.564
Captain, no sign of any American Ships.

01:12:03.273 --> 01:12:05.733
Maintain course, full ahead.

01:12:06.317 --> 01:12:08.820
Man: The Russians have
sent their warheads to Cuba.

01:12:09.279 --> 01:12:11.364
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.

01:12:11.614 --> 01:12:15.743
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:21.416
If that ship crosses the line, they will have
declared war against the United States.

01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:25.378
We will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

01:12:26.379 --> 01:12:27.630
Do we agree?

01:12:32.802 --> 01:12:34.053
Man: Dispatch the Seventh fleet.

01:12:37.473 --> 01:12:40.977
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.

01:12:47.483 --> 01:12:50.278
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.363
Living in such hardship.

01:12:52.655 --> 01:12:55.241
Well it was a hardship softened by me.

01:12:58.536 --> 01:13:01.080
Come on, time for the tour.

01:13:08.254 --> 01:13:12.133
Moscow, Russia

01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:15.845
Dear comrades.

01:13:15.845 --> 01:13:23.394
The United States have dispatched
war ships for Cuba.

01:13:23.978 --> 01:13:27.899
This leaves us with no choice.

01:13:29.234 --> 01:13:32.654
Comrade First Secretary.

01:13:33.404 --> 01:13:36.491
We must send in our fleet.

01:13:39.244 --> 01:13:41.204
Dispatch the fleet!

01:13:42.872 --> 01:13:43.915
(Camera flash)

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.962
TV announcer: President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:52.841
Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
armed for Cuba.

01:13:53.925 --> 01:14:00.139
The Soviet Union reacted by terming it
as step along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.

01:14:10.817 --> 01:14:13.236
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

01:14:14.279 --> 01:14:14.988
All right.

01:14:22.328 --> 01:14:24.414
No, no I can't I'm sorry.

01:14:24.664 --> 01:14:25.832
I can't shoot anybody point blank,

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:26.791
let alone my friend.

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:28.710
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.211
You're always telling me I should push myself.

01:14:30.503 --> 01:14:33.673
If you know you can deflect it, then
you're not challenging yourself.

01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:38.011
What ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:39.846
What, I can't.

01:14:41.055 --> 01:14:43.516
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.

01:14:43.725 --> 01:14:45.101
No, the anger's not enough.

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.645
Well it's gotten the job done all this time.

01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:49.480
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

01:14:50.982 --> 01:14:51.816
Hey, come here.

01:14:52.984 --> 01:14:55.028
Let's try something a little more challenging.

01:14:56.321 --> 01:14:59.365
My step-father took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously.

01:14:59.616 --> 01:15:00.575
This way.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.827
That's why he had this bunker built down here.

01:15:03.077 --> 01:15:05.413
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.

01:15:05.622 --> 01:15:07.081
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?

01:15:07.373 --> 01:15:09.876
No, he had this place built to
with stand a nuclear bomb.

01:15:10.084 --> 01:15:11.544
I think it can handle you, Alex.

01:15:11.836 --> 01:15:13.922
You know when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

01:15:14.964 --> 01:15:18.426
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

01:15:18.968 --> 01:15:21.679
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's part of your training.

01:15:22.388 --> 01:15:23.431
(Sonic whistle)
(Glass shatters)

01:15:24.807 --> 01:15:25.850
(Charles joyfully laughs)

01:15:26.768 --> 01:15:27.977
What you're doing is incredible.

01:15:28.228 --> 01:15:30.939
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves at
the same resonate frequency of the glass.

01:15:30.939 --> 01:15:32.023
That's why it shatters.

01:15:32.023 --> 01:15:34.651
But this, it's like any
other muscle in the body.

01:15:34.651 --> 01:15:35.693
You can control it.

01:15:37.612 --> 01:15:40.114
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

01:15:40.573 --> 01:15:41.991
Robert Louis Stevenson,
"Jekyll and Hyde".

01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:43.076
Top marks.

01:15:43.576 --> 01:15:45.411
Still it really wasn't really about good
and evil. Was it, Hank.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.665
It was about man's animal nature,
and his struggle to control it.

01:15:48.873 --> 01:15:49.832
To conform.

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:52.126
It is that struggle which is holding you back.

01:15:52.794 --> 01:15:55.046
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.

01:15:55.505 --> 01:15:56.464
You are too.

01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:59.384
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

01:15:59.843 --> 01:16:03.847
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.

01:16:06.516 --> 01:16:07.392
Charles: Whenever you're ready.

01:16:10.228 --> 01:16:12.605
(Explosion, light beeping)

01:16:14.148 --> 01:16:16.234
(Fires roaring)
Oh my god.

01:16:20.029 --> 01:16:21.990
Charles: I will teach you to control this, Alex.

01:16:25.368 --> 01:16:26.828
Sean: You're sure that this will work.

01:16:27.537 --> 01:16:29.622
Anything is possible. I based the design...

01:16:29.622 --> 01:16:31.958
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.

01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:33.835
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.

01:16:34.127 --> 01:16:35.795
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.

01:16:36.004 --> 01:16:37.755
Catch them at the right angle,
and they should carry you.

01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:41.634
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.

01:16:42.552 --> 01:16:43.386
Good luck.

01:16:44.137 --> 01:16:45.430
Charles: And don't forget to scream.

01:16:52.395 --> 01:16:53.438
Ahh.

01:16:55.398 --> 01:16:58.610
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

01:17:00.278 --> 01:17:03.990
Charles: On your marks, get set...GO!

01:17:19.506 --> 01:17:20.715
Oh, congratulations my friend.

01:17:21.382 --> 01:17:22.926
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

01:17:25.178 --> 01:17:26.095
Impressive, Hank.

01:17:26.763 --> 01:17:28.556
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.

01:17:28.932 --> 01:17:29.849
Right, Bozo?

01:17:30.725 --> 01:17:32.185
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex

01:17:33.895 --> 01:17:34.812
Charles: Come on, Hank.

01:17:46.032 --> 01:17:48.868
Erik: If you're using half the
concentration to look normal.

01:17:49.244 --> 01:17:51.871
Then you're only half paying attention to
whatever else you do.

01:17:52.163 --> 01:17:54.999
Just pointing out something that could save your life.

01:17:59.629 --> 01:18:01.422
You want society to accept you.

01:18:02.382 --> 01:18:04.175
But you can't even accept yourself.

01:18:10.932 --> 01:18:11.850
Alex: Sexy.

01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:13.935
This is just the prototype.

01:18:14.143 --> 01:18:16.354
The real one will look considerably better,
it'll be a whole suit.

01:18:16.646 --> 01:18:21.609
See these sensors measure your energy output,
this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.

01:18:21.734 --> 01:18:24.028
All right try hitting the one in the middle,
just the one in the middle, mind.

01:18:24.988 --> 01:18:25.697
Charles: Good luck.

01:18:27.866 --> 01:18:28.908
(Plasma beam blasts)

01:18:32.537 --> 01:18:33.580
Oomph!

01:18:36.165 --> 01:18:38.918
You ought to see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that.

01:18:39.043 --> 01:18:40.879
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.

01:18:41.087 --> 01:18:43.047
When you're forty you will still
have the looks of a teenager.

01:18:43.756 --> 01:18:47.051
You have the most incredible cellular
structure I've ever seen.

01:18:52.557 --> 01:18:54.267
Sean: You truly believe I'll fly this time?

01:18:54.559 --> 01:18:55.810
Charles: Unreservedly.

01:18:56.227 --> 01:18:57.478
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

01:18:57.687 --> 01:18:59.063
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

01:19:00.607 --> 01:19:01.482
I'm going to die!

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.277
All right, look we're not going to make you do anything
that your not so...

01:19:04.277 --> 01:19:05.528
Here, let me help him.

01:19:07.447 --> 01:19:08.489
Erik!

01:19:11.826 --> 01:19:12.869
(Screams)

01:19:20.043 --> 01:19:22.754
Whaoooo!
(Laughs)

01:19:27.592 --> 01:19:29.135
Wahhh hooo!

01:19:29.761 --> 01:19:30.803
What?

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:32.764
You know you were thinking the same.

01:19:33.932 --> 01:19:37.310
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.

01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:39.812
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.

01:19:40.647 --> 01:19:43.274
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:45.652
Charles: I have complete and utter faith in you.

01:19:49.572 --> 01:19:50.615
(Plasma beam explodes)

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.252
- Am I still a Bozo?
- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.

01:20:03.503 --> 01:20:04.754
But nice job.

01:20:07.799 --> 01:20:08.758
See that?

01:20:09.592 --> 01:20:11.010
Try turning it to face us.

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:17.892
(Exhales)

01:20:30.697 --> 01:20:36.077
You know, I believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

01:20:37.787 --> 01:20:39.956
Would you mind, if I...?

01:21:14.032 --> 01:21:15.366
What did you just do to me?

01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:20.288
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

01:21:22.248 --> 01:21:24.626
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.

01:21:25.752 --> 01:21:27.629
I didn't know I still had that.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.924
There's so much more to you than you know.

01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:36.679
Not just pain, and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.

01:21:37.722 --> 01:21:39.766
And when you can access all that.

01:21:40.141 --> 01:21:42.769
You will possess a power no one can match.

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.355
Not even me.

01:21:47.232 --> 01:21:49.400
So, come on. Try again.

01:22:05.792 --> 01:22:08.920
(Metal in Satellite dish creaking)

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.109
- Moira: Hey!
-Well done.

01:22:31.693 --> 01:22:33.486
The President is about to make his address.

01:22:35.655 --> 01:22:39.742
TV announcer: It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile,

01:22:39.909 --> 01:22:43.204
...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba.

01:22:43.496 --> 01:22:47.250
As an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:51.796
Requiring a full retaliatory response.
Upon the Soviet Union.

01:22:51.796 --> 01:22:53.882
- That’s' where we're going to find, Shaw'
- How do you know?

01:22:54.132 --> 01:22:57.677
Charles: Two super powers facing off, and
he want's to start world war III.

01:22:58.595 --> 01:23:00.013
He won't leave anything to chance.

01:23:00.471 --> 01:23:04.184
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good nights sleep.

01:23:04.184 --> 01:23:06.978
Kennedy: ...ultimately leads to war.

01:23:07.478 --> 01:23:11.357
TV announcer: Tensions mount as the Soviet Missile
ship nears Cuba.

01:23:11.941 --> 01:23:16.279
All diplomatic efforts to avert
Nuclear war have thus far failed.

01:23:16.821 --> 01:23:21.034
As the American people ready themselves,
for the likelihood of an atomic attack.

01:23:21.326 --> 01:23:23.786
There are widespread reports of panic buying.

01:23:24.579 --> 01:23:26.164
Supermarkets cleared.

01:23:26.414 --> 01:23:29.042
As shelters unused since the second world war,

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:31.461
are stocked for what may lie ahead.

01:23:31.878 --> 01:23:36.007
In all its history, America has never
faced a greater threat.

01:23:36.549 --> 01:23:40.261
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.

01:23:45.016 --> 01:23:46.893
(Knock on door)
Come in.

01:23:47.769 --> 01:23:48.770
Hank: Hey.

01:23:50.104 --> 01:23:51.105
Got a surprise for you.

01:24:00.532 --> 01:24:03.493
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.870
The serum works like an anti-biotic.

01:24:06.162 --> 01:24:08.748
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.

01:24:09.374 --> 01:24:11.376
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

01:24:14.879 --> 01:24:16.381
Do you still want to do this?

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:19.634
Should we have to hide?

01:24:21.177 --> 01:24:22.220
You already do.

01:24:23.179 --> 01:24:25.682
You're hiding right now.
Like I have my whole life.

01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:29.352
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.

01:24:29.352 --> 01:24:31.104
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.

01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:32.397
Yeah.

01:24:39.779 --> 01:24:41.197
Hank, don't.

01:24:43.116 --> 01:24:47.203
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.

01:24:50.039 --> 01:24:53.084
Raven: Look at all of us. Look at
all we've achieved this week.

01:24:53.418 --> 01:24:55.086
All we will achieve.

01:24:56.629 --> 01:25:01.593
We are different. But we shouldn't
be trying to fit into society.

01:25:02.719 --> 01:25:05.096
Raven: Society should aspire and be more like us.

01:25:06.806 --> 01:25:09.809
Mutant, and proud.

01:25:15.023 --> 01:25:18.776
It behooves me to tell you,
but even if we save the world tomorrow.

01:25:18.943 --> 01:25:21.112
And mutants are accepted into society.

01:25:22.071 --> 01:25:24.782
My feet and your natural blue form.

01:25:25.867 --> 01:25:27.619
Will never be deemed beautiful.

01:25:33.249 --> 01:25:34.667
You look beautiful now.

01:25:36.628 --> 01:25:39.631
We need this cure.

01:26:06.699 --> 01:26:11.663
Cuba, Russia, America makes no difference.

01:26:12.622 --> 01:26:15.250
Shaw's declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:21.714
- He has to be stopped.
- I'm not going to stop Shaw, I'm going to kill him.

01:26:24.968 --> 01:26:26.761
Do you have it in you to allow that?

01:26:33.309 --> 01:26:35.603
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:37.313
But things have changed.

01:26:38.398 --> 01:26:40.441
What started as a covert mission,

01:26:40.692 --> 01:26:43.695
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.

01:26:43.695 --> 01:26:45.905
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.

01:26:46.531 --> 01:26:49.993
They'll fear us, and that
fear will turn to hatred.

01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:53.621
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent, Shaw.

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:55.665
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

01:26:55.915 --> 01:26:57.000
Would they do the same for us?

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.751
We have it in us to be the better men.

01:26:59.002 --> 01:27:00.545
We already are.

01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:02.547
We're the next stage of human evolution.

01:27:02.755 --> 01:27:04.257
- You said it yourself.
- Enough.

01:27:04.883 --> 01:27:06.759
Are you really so naive?

01:27:06.759 --> 01:27:09.429
As to think they won't battle their own extinction?

01:27:10.972 --> 01:27:13.266
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry.

01:27:14.517 --> 01:27:16.394
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us.

01:27:16.519 --> 01:27:19.772
And you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like Moira.

01:27:20.064 --> 01:27:21.900
And you believe they're all like, Shaw.

01:27:24.402 --> 01:27:27.238
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.

01:27:28.531 --> 01:27:31.576
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

01:27:33.286 --> 01:27:35.205
Peace was never an option.

01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:23.795
(Bones cracking)
No.

01:28:25.505 --> 01:28:26.548
No.

01:28:30.218 --> 01:28:32.720
(Clothes tearing, bones cracking)

01:28:55.243 --> 01:28:56.286
Well...

01:28:58.705 --> 01:29:00.039
This is a surprise.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.708
The nice kind?

01:29:03.793 --> 01:29:06.171
No, Raven, I want to go to bed.

01:29:07.422 --> 01:29:08.756
Maybe in a few years.

01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:14.888
(Grown up voice) How about now?

01:29:20.476 --> 01:29:22.020
I prefer the real, Raven.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.443
I said the real, Raven.

01:29:38.494 --> 01:29:39.871
Perfection.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.545
- Could you pass me my robe?
- You don't have to hide.

01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:55.970
Have you ever looked at a tiger,
and thought you'd want to cover it up?

01:29:58.473 --> 01:30:00.141
No, but...

01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:02.101
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

01:30:04.062 --> 01:30:06.314
Only in life the world has tried to tame you.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.775
It's time for you to be free.

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.422
Raven: You know sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like.

01:30:31.422 --> 01:30:33.424
If you hadn't found me here that night.

01:30:34.008 --> 01:30:36.219
Fairable, E..gah...ah.

01:30:37.679 --> 01:30:39.013
For gods sake, Raven!

01:30:39.597 --> 01:30:41.975
Where are you clothes?
Pu...put some, put some clothes on.

01:30:42.141 --> 01:30:43.893
That's not what you said when you first saw me.

01:30:44.644 --> 01:30:47.188
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

01:30:48.314 --> 01:30:49.858
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.

01:30:50.608 --> 01:30:51.734
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:57.490
Hank tells me that he's found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

01:30:59.784 --> 01:31:02.203
You going to tell me what's the matter?
Or will I have to read your mind?

01:31:02.453 --> 01:31:04.080
You promised me you would never do that.

01:31:04.372 --> 01:31:08.793
Until recently, I never had to use my powers
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

01:31:08.918 --> 01:31:12.630
You know Charles, I used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world.

01:31:12.922 --> 01:31:16.467
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

01:31:16.509 --> 01:31:17.594
You want to be a part of it.

01:31:39.866 --> 01:31:40.992
What the hell happened here?

01:31:49.667 --> 01:31:50.919
Hank has been busy.

01:31:51.461 --> 01:31:52.837
Do we really have to wear these?

01:31:53.755 --> 01:31:56.424
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force,

01:31:56.633 --> 01:31:59.594
or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.

01:32:24.536 --> 01:32:25.578
Where's Hank?

01:32:27.747 --> 01:32:28.915
Hank: I'm here.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.676
Hank?

01:32:45.682 --> 01:32:50.061
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.

01:32:52.564 --> 01:32:53.690
It didn't work.

01:32:54.357 --> 01:32:55.942
Yes it did, Hank.

01:32:56.276 --> 01:33:00.071
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.

01:33:01.197 --> 01:33:02.740
This is you.

01:33:04.576 --> 01:33:05.952
No more hiding.

01:33:06.828 --> 01:33:07.871
Never looked better, man.

01:33:08.413 --> 01:33:09.455
Hank!

01:33:09.455 --> 01:33:10.790
Growls.
(Erik gags)

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.334
Don't mock me.

01:33:13.668 --> 01:33:15.253
Charles: Hank, put him down immediately, please.

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.796
Hank...HANK!

01:33:19.549 --> 01:33:21.092
I wasn't.

01:33:21.384 --> 01:33:23.469
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.

01:33:23.678 --> 01:33:26.890
I think I got a new name for you, Beast.

01:33:26.973 --> 01:33:28.016
(Growls)

01:33:29.267 --> 01:33:33.605
- You sure you can fly this thing?
- Of course I can, I designed it.

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:39.986
Cuba

01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:47.118
Captain: Status of the cargo ship?

01:33:47.785 --> 01:33:50.914
Lieutenant Commander: Bearing 1-8-0, 12 knots.

01:33:53.124 --> 01:33:55.376
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

01:33:56.586 --> 01:33:58.588
God help them if they cross it.

01:34:01.007 --> 01:34:02.509
God help us all.

01:34:03.009 --> 01:34:06.262
- Lieutenant Commander: Sound general quarters.
- Officers: General quarters, general quarters.

01:34:06.554 --> 01:34:09.015
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes sir.

01:34:09.307 --> 01:34:11.100
Lieutenant Commander: Set conditions, zero.

01:34:11.768 --> 01:34:13.978
Man on intercom: General quarters, battle stations.

01:34:23.363 --> 01:34:28.701
Captain, we already have our orders.
Why so eager for new ones?

01:34:29.702 --> 01:34:33.414
I lived through one war, Comrade.

01:34:34.541 --> 01:34:36.626
I'd prefer not to start another.

01:34:39.087 --> 01:34:41.130
Battle stations,
Now!

01:34:44.175 --> 01:34:48.930
Captain: Gun boss, target
cargo ship, bearing 1-8-zero.

01:34:51.015 --> 01:34:54.060
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

01:34:54.227 --> 01:34:56.145
Communications officer: From the Kremlin, sir.

01:34:56.563 --> 01:35:00.608
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...

01:35:00.608 --> 01:35:03.903
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.

01:35:03.903 --> 01:35:05.363
Communications officer: Aral Sea, come in.

01:35:06.072 --> 01:35:07.740
Aral Sea, come in.

01:35:08.741 --> 01:35:10.159
They are not responding.

01:35:10.159 --> 01:35:11.744
Officer: She's not turning around.

01:35:11.744 --> 01:35:14.372
Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.

01:35:14.372 --> 01:35:16.082
Do not cross the line.

01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:18.918
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.754
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

01:35:34.392 --> 01:35:36.144
Looks pretty messy out there.

01:35:46.988 --> 01:35:49.991
Russian Communications officer: Aral Sea,
you are ordered to turn around.

01:35:50.825 --> 01:35:53.578
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

01:35:53.578 --> 01:35:55.371
He's still here, somewhere.

01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:56.915
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.

01:35:57.123 --> 01:35:59.459
That ship crosses the line, our
boys are going to blow it up.

01:35:59.876 --> 01:36:01.294
Moria: And the war begins.

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.047
Unless they're not on board.

01:36:06.549 --> 01:36:08.718
USS Independence,
this is, Alexander Nevski.

01:36:09.135 --> 01:36:11.346
Nevski: We have lost control of our cargo ship.

01:36:11.346 --> 01:36:14.140
Nevski: She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.975
Repeat, do not fire.

01:36:16.017 --> 01:36:17.810
They've signaled their
cargo ship to turn around, sir.

01:36:19.312 --> 01:36:23.233
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.

01:36:23.399 --> 01:36:25.610
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.

01:36:26.152 --> 01:36:27.946
Five...four...

01:36:51.052 --> 01:36:53.388
(Raven screams)
Hold on! Hold on!

01:36:55.265 --> 01:36:56.307
((Roars))

01:37:02.188 --> 01:37:03.022
No!

01:37:07.735 --> 01:37:11.406
- What was that?
- The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.

01:37:11.948 --> 01:37:13.950
A little warning next time, professor.

01:37:14.075 --> 01:37:14.868
Sorry about that.

01:37:15.076 --> 01:37:16.661
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:37:17.453 --> 01:37:19.205
Captain: Son of a...

01:37:19.205 --> 01:37:21.541
Give me Sin-clan on the horn, I want a new set of orders.

01:37:25.295 --> 01:37:27.130
Congratulations, Commander.

01:37:27.714 --> 01:37:31.593
You just averted a nuclear war.

01:37:32.093 --> 01:37:33.136
What?

01:37:33.553 --> 01:37:34.971
Take him to the brig.

01:37:35.221 --> 01:37:37.056
What? What just happened?

01:37:38.892 --> 01:37:40.643
They say the comrade lost his mind.

01:37:41.019 --> 01:37:42.353
The Americans' are applauding.

01:37:44.731 --> 01:37:45.607
They're here.

01:37:45.857 --> 01:37:47.692
That telepath is powerful.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.863
We're moving to a back-up plan.

01:37:55.283 --> 01:37:57.535
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.

01:37:57.744 --> 01:37:58.995
But I still can't locate Shaw.

01:37:59.245 --> 01:38:01.206
He's down there, we need to find him now.

01:38:01.414 --> 01:38:02.290
Hank?

01:38:02.332 --> 01:38:06.628
- Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners?
- No, nothing.

01:38:07.337 --> 01:38:10.924
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.

01:38:12.592 --> 01:38:13.426
Yes we do.

01:38:14.469 --> 01:38:15.386
Yes we do.

01:38:20.058 --> 01:38:21.267
Shaw: They were ready for war.

01:38:21.518 --> 01:38:24.103
We just need to strike another match
to light the fuse.

01:38:24.354 --> 01:38:27.106
And we still have the most powerful weapon of all.

01:38:27.857 --> 01:38:28.858
Me.

01:38:29.275 --> 01:38:34.614
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

01:38:37.742 --> 01:38:39.869
Hank, level the bloody plane!

01:38:45.291 --> 01:38:47.377
Whoa, you back right off.

01:38:48.336 --> 01:38:50.255
Beast, open the Bombay doors.

01:38:58.513 --> 01:39:02.851
Charles: Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.

01:39:03.142 --> 01:39:07.188
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.

01:39:07.522 --> 01:39:13.653
- On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
- WHOA!!!

01:39:15.488 --> 01:39:16.531
(Sonic blast hits water)

01:39:29.627 --> 01:39:32.463
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cams off.

01:39:35.341 --> 01:39:36.384
(Sonic blast whistles through water)

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.762
(High pitched feedback)

01:39:45.143 --> 01:39:46.895
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.

01:39:49.647 --> 01:39:50.565
You ready for this?

01:39:51.274 --> 01:39:52.442
Let's find out.

01:40:18.718 --> 01:40:19.761
(Pulsing with power)

01:40:56.464 --> 01:41:00.760
**Remember, the point between rage and serenity.**

01:41:50.852 --> 01:41:51.895
(Engines rev)

01:42:17.086 --> 01:42:19.756
(Winds swirl)

01:42:24.552 --> 01:42:26.137
Erik, take my hand!

01:42:27.013 --> 01:42:30.558
Oh, hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.

01:42:45.949 --> 01:42:47.826
Erik, take my hand!

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:53.873
(Rumbling, ship groaning)

01:43:14.769 --> 01:43:16.771
(Screaming, Hank growls)

01:43:21.484 --> 01:43:22.819
Erik: Down.

01:43:29.617 --> 01:43:33.872
(Fires crackling)

01:43:38.251 --> 01:43:41.171
- Moira, Moira, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:47.719
I read the teleporter's mind.

01:43:47.969 --> 01:43:49.846
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.

01:43:50.096 --> 01:43:52.098
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.

01:43:52.265 --> 01:43:54.350
We've got no time, the Geiger
counter's going out of control.

01:43:54.517 --> 01:43:55.560
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.

01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:57.979
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleet's out immediately.

01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.980
I'm going in.

01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:01.149
Charles: Beast, Havok, back him up.

01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:03.026
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.

01:44:03.276 --> 01:44:05.612
Charles: But I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me.

01:44:05.904 --> 01:44:07.739
Then we just hope to god it's
not to late for me to stop him.

01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:08.948
- Got it.
- Good luck!

01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:11.659
- Charles: Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

01:44:11.868 --> 01:44:12.660
We don't have time for this.

01:44:12.911 --> 01:44:15.205
Anything comes in that entrance,
you're taking care of it, yes?

01:44:16.122 --> 01:44:16.831
Fine.

01:44:33.097 --> 01:44:34.140
Beeeeaast!

01:44:37.936 --> 01:44:39.771
If we go, you go

01:44:42.982 --> 01:44:45.276
We believe Shaw is trying to
detonate some kind of bomb.

01:44:50.532 --> 01:44:52.534
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.

01:44:52.992 --> 01:44:54.661
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

01:44:54.661 --> 01:44:56.871
We have to assume that, that's where Shaw is.

01:45:06.005 --> 01:45:07.549
Gang way, gang way.

01:45:10.426 --> 01:45:11.469
(Sparks flying)

01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:17.851
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.

01:45:29.988 --> 01:45:31.739
Navy officer: Stop, don't move.

01:45:37.203 --> 01:45:38.246
((wings fluttering))

01:45:39.664 --> 01:45:40.748
Get down!

01:46:04.814 --> 01:46:06.357
Charles: **Erik you're there, you've reached the void.**

01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:08.318
He's not here Charles,
Shaw is not here.

01:46:08.401 --> 01:46:10.570
- He's left the sub.
- What? He's got to be there.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.114
He has to be, there's no where
else he can be, keep looking.

01:46:13.156 --> 01:46:15.742
And I'm telling you he's not,
there's no one here, god damn it!

01:46:19.454 --> 01:46:23.249
Shaw: Erik, what a pleasant surprise.

01:46:23.249 --> 01:46:25.001
Erik?
Erik!

01:46:27.378 --> 01:46:28.755
So good to see you again.

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:47.315
Shaw: May I ask you something?

01:46:48.942 --> 01:46:50.485
Why are you on their side?

01:46:50.985 --> 01:46:51.778
- He's gone.
- What?

01:46:52.028 --> 01:46:54.948
He's gone into the void. I can't
communicate with him there.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.909
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down,

01:46:57.909 --> 01:47:00.662
...as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end.

01:47:08.586 --> 01:47:11.047
(Alarm blaring)

01:47:13.049 --> 01:47:14.092
(Sonic boom)

01:47:27.856 --> 01:47:28.898
(Alex joyfully laughs)

01:47:29.399 --> 01:47:30.775
Alex: Yeah!

01:47:44.539 --> 01:47:46.624
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:50.170
I truly am.

01:47:53.214 --> 01:47:54.257
(Glass shatters)

01:47:58.678 --> 01:47:59.679
He's back.

01:48:00.054 --> 01:48:03.224
**Erik, whatever you're doing keep
doing it, it's starting to work.**

01:48:04.309 --> 01:48:07.562
But everything I did,
I did for you.

01:48:07.645 --> 01:48:11.941
To unlock your power. To make
you...embrace it.

01:48:15.111 --> 01:48:16.321
**It's working.**

01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:18.740
I'm starting to see him, but I
can't yet touch his mind.

01:48:19.365 --> 01:48:20.408
(Wings fluttering)

01:48:25.079 --> 01:48:26.122
(Released Plasma blast)

01:48:31.878 --> 01:48:32.921
(Laughs with relief)

01:48:33.046 --> 01:48:35.632
You've come a long way from bending gates.

01:48:36.132 --> 01:48:37.425
I'm so proud of you.

01:48:45.725 --> 01:48:48.394
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.

01:48:48.603 --> 01:48:52.941
Think how much further we could go, together.

01:49:07.038 --> 01:49:08.081
Roars

01:49:12.836 --> 01:49:15.088
Stop, Azazel!

01:49:30.061 --> 01:49:32.939
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.

01:49:33.523 --> 01:49:34.691
I want to help you.

01:49:34.941 --> 01:49:38.278
This is our time.
Our age.

01:49:39.237 --> 01:49:42.532
We are the future of the human race.

01:49:43.616 --> 01:49:47.996
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.

01:49:50.331 --> 01:49:53.418
Everything you did, made me stronger.

01:49:55.211 --> 01:49:57.172
Made me the weapon I am today.

01:49:59.465 --> 01:50:00.675
That's the truth.

01:50:02.302 --> 01:50:03.928
I've known it all along.

01:50:10.435 --> 01:50:11.936
You are my creator.

01:50:12.604 --> 01:50:14.314
- NOW, Charles!
- AHHH!

01:50:15.815 --> 01:50:16.524
Are you okay?

01:50:16.774 --> 01:50:19.527
Moira be quiet, I can only
control this man for so long.

01:50:20.278 --> 01:50:21.321
(Metal clatters on floor)

01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:34.292
Sorry, Charles.

01:50:34.292 --> 01:50:36.836
**Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...**

01:50:36.836 --> 01:50:37.921
But I don’t trust you.

01:50:37.921 --> 01:50:39.422
** Erik, there will be no telling what...**

01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:42.091
No.

01:50:43.051 --> 01:50:44.969
- Moira: Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!

01:50:52.185 --> 01:50:56.648
If you're in there, I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you've said.

01:50:59.317 --> 01:51:01.069
We are the future.

01:51:03.571 --> 01:51:04.948
But...

01:51:06.407 --> 01:51:09.869
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.

01:51:19.170 --> 01:51:20.588
This is what we're going to do.

01:51:20.964 --> 01:51:22.924
No, please Erik, no.

01:51:23.258 --> 01:51:26.886
I'm going to count to three.
And I'm going to move the coin.

01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:30.139
One...

01:51:31.891 --> 01:51:33.518
Please, Erik.

01:51:38.147 --> 01:51:39.190
(Panting)

01:51:41.651 --> 01:51:42.861
Two...

01:51:49.742 --> 01:51:50.869
Three.

01:51:52.745 --> 01:51:54.664
Aaaaaaaah!

01:52:12.724 --> 01:52:13.766
(Clatters on floor)

01:52:20.106 --> 01:52:22.942
Stryker: The Russians share our concerns.

01:52:23.193 --> 01:52:25.862
And will join a strike on all the mutants.

01:52:26.154 --> 01:52:28.198
We can end this threat for good.

01:52:28.406 --> 01:52:30.283
We'll never have another opportunity like this.

01:52:30.366 --> 01:52:31.993
We have an agent on that beach.

01:52:32.327 --> 01:52:35.455
- One agent.
- She's a good agent.

01:52:35.705 --> 01:52:37.123
She's collateral damage.

01:52:43.046 --> 01:52:45.215
Erik: Today our fighting stops.

01:53:09.906 --> 01:53:12.742
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.

01:53:13.117 --> 01:53:14.869
The real enemy is out there.

01:53:16.663 --> 01:53:18.873
Erik: I feel their guns moving in the water.

01:53:19.165 --> 01:53:21.376
Their metal targeting us.

01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:25.505
Americans, Soviets, humans.

01:53:26.673 --> 01:53:28.758
United in their fear of the unknown.

01:53:30.176 --> 01:53:33.471
Erik: A Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants.

01:53:36.266 --> 01:53:37.517
Go ahead, Charles.

01:53:39.811 --> 01:53:41.271
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:53:47.193 --> 01:53:49.362
(Turrets shifting, alarm blaring)

01:54:01.541 --> 01:54:04.335
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-7-zero.

01:54:04.544 --> 01:54:05.795
Respond, over.

01:54:07.005 --> 01:54:09.591
The beach is secure, call off the attack.

01:54:09.674 --> 01:54:12.135
The beach is targeted and ready to
be fired upon, sir.

01:54:12.302 --> 01:54:14.220
- Stand by.
- Officer: Standing by, sir.

01:54:18.641 --> 01:54:19.684
Hello?

01:54:21.811 --> 01:54:22.854
Hello!

01:54:30.945 --> 01:54:33.656
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:54:51.466 --> 01:54:52.509
(Missiles whistle in air)

01:55:21.996 --> 01:55:23.998
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.

01:55:24.874 --> 01:55:26.251
Charles: This is the time to prove it.

01:55:30.296 --> 01:55:32.382
There are thousands of men on those ships.

01:55:32.382 --> 01:55:34.175
getting orders, innocent men.

01:55:34.759 --> 01:55:36.511
They're just following orders.

01:55:38.721 --> 01:55:41.182
I've been at the mercy of men
just following orders.

01:55:45.728 --> 01:55:47.105
Never again.

01:55:51.734 --> 01:55:53.069
Erik, release them.

01:55:59.993 --> 01:56:01.578
Noooo!

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.752
Erik: I don't want to hurt you,
don't make me.

01:56:10.837 --> 01:56:12.130
Stay back!

01:56:14.841 --> 01:56:16.050
Charles, enough.

01:56:21.014 --> 01:56:22.140
Erik, stop!

01:56:32.609 --> 01:56:35.153
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.

01:56:45.246 --> 01:56:46.289
(Bullet ricochets)

01:57:24.744 --> 01:57:26.371
(Charles grunts with pain)
I'm so sorry.

01:57:26.371 --> 01:57:27.872
I said back off!

01:57:30.041 --> 01:57:32.460
You, you did this!

01:57:36.631 --> 01:57:40.176
(Moria choking)
Charles: Please...

01:57:41.261 --> 01:57:45.014
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.

01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:56.651
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

01:57:57.026 --> 01:57:58.945
I tried to warn you, Charles.

01:58:01.406 --> 01:58:05.577
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.

01:58:06.327 --> 01:58:09.289
All of us, together. Protecting each other.

01:58:11.416 --> 01:58:13.251
We want the same thing.

01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:16.087
Oh, my friend.

01:58:16.796 --> 01:58:20.049
I'm sorry, but we do not.

01:58:36.316 --> 01:58:42.155
- Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
- Charles: It's all right, it's all right.

01:58:43.323 --> 01:58:45.408
(Charles grunts with pain)

01:58:46.284 --> 01:58:48.328
His society won't accept us.

01:58:49.662 --> 01:58:51.289
We form our own.

01:58:51.414 --> 01:58:53.458
The humans have played their hand.

01:58:55.752 --> 01:58:58.087
Now we get ready to play ours.

01:59:00.882 --> 01:59:02.258
Who's with me?

01:59:13.895 --> 01:59:15.313
No more hiding.

01:59:34.207 --> 01:59:35.250
(Charles groans)

01:59:41.673 --> 01:59:46.219
You, you should go with him.
It's what you want.

01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:49.180
You promised me you would never read my mind.

01:59:49.722 --> 01:59:50.682
I know.

01:59:51.307 --> 01:59:53.935
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

01:59:54.686 --> 01:59:55.728
I'm sorry.

02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:02.527
Take care of him.

02:00:18.001 --> 02:00:20.628
And Beast, never forget.

02:00:21.546 --> 02:00:24.591
Mutant and proud.

02:00:33.057 --> 02:00:34.434
Help me out, help him.

02:00:35.518 --> 02:00:37.061
I'm going to get you to a hospital.

02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:40.398
- Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.

02:00:40.398 --> 02:00:45.945
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...

02:00:48.114 --> 02:00:49.491
I can't feel my legs

02:00:51.618 --> 02:00:53.244
I can't feel my legs.

02:00:55.288 --> 02:00:56.956
I can't feel my legs.

02:01:08.801 --> 02:01:12.430
Kennedy: In this week of thanksgiving.
There is much for which we can be grateful.

02:01:12.639 --> 02:01:15.934
As you look back to where we stood,
only four weeks ago.

02:01:16.226 --> 02:01:19.354
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies.

02:01:19.521 --> 02:01:22.023
And the calm determination of the American people.

02:01:22.524 --> 02:01:25.235
These qualities may be tested many more times.

02:01:25.443 --> 02:01:26.694
In this decade.

02:01:29.906 --> 02:01:32.242
Moria: So how many students
do you think you'll have here?

02:01:32.242 --> 02:01:34.285
Once you get the academy up and running.

02:01:34.786 --> 02:01:38.665
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.

02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:46.297
You know, one day the government is going
to realize how lucky they were,

02:01:46.464 --> 02:01:48.174
...to have Professor X on their side.

02:01:49.801 --> 02:01:52.178
I guess I've been on the
road to a professor now, aren't I.

02:01:52.178 --> 02:01:53.805
Next thing I'll be going bald.

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.809
We're still on the government’s side, Moira.

02:01:58.393 --> 02:02:01.062
Still a G-man, just without the G.

02:02:01.437 --> 02:02:04.315
No, you're your own team now.

02:02:05.108 --> 02:02:06.234
It's better.

02:02:07.318 --> 02:02:10.071
You're, "X-Men".

02:02:10.405 --> 02:02:11.447
(Laughing)

02:02:12.282 --> 02:02:13.783
Yes, I like the sound of that.

02:02:14.325 --> 02:02:20.290
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.

02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:21.583
I know.

02:02:23.251 --> 02:02:26.963
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.

02:02:27.797 --> 02:02:30.091
I'll never tell them where you are.

02:02:30.675 --> 02:02:31.718
Ever.

02:02:32.635 --> 02:02:34.304
I know you won't.

02:02:36.222 --> 02:02:37.265
My love.

02:02:44.898 --> 02:02:47.192
I remember the attack on HQ.

02:02:47.775 --> 02:02:49.527
Leaving to go somewhere else.

02:02:50.195 --> 02:02:53.364
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.283
That's it.

02:02:56.493 --> 02:02:58.703
McCone: All that time wiped clean from your mind.

02:02:59.037 --> 02:03:00.205
Just gone.

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:02.582
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?

02:03:03.166 --> 02:03:10.924
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.

02:03:13.092 --> 02:03:15.929
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.

02:03:16.471 --> 02:03:19.974
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

02:03:20.808 --> 02:03:21.851
(Loud explosion)

02:03:25.021 --> 02:03:26.147
What the hell was that?

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.950
(Metal door creaking)

02:03:42.872 --> 02:03:45.083
Erik: I know we've had our differences.

02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:51.631
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Erik: Gone.

02:03:52.674 --> 02:03:55.802
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.

02:03:55.802 --> 02:03:57.762
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

02:04:03.142 --> 02:04:04.227
Erik: Join us.

02:04:11.651 --> 02:04:13.069
Erik, I believe.

02:04:16.447 --> 02:04:18.158
I prefer...

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.077
...Magneto.
