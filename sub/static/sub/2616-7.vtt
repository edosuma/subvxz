WEBVTT

00:04.033 --> 00:09.762
Now the story of evacuations, they're under way for
beach communities and both Dade and Palm Beach counties

00:09.778 --> 00:12.249
Some of the keys have already
been evacuated.

00:12.436 --> 00:18.763
Oceanographers predict that a massive tidal surge
or tsunami will hit Miami Beach by late afternoon...

00:18.794 --> 00:24.949
...same long lines at every gas station in the costal areas as
people fill their tanks before they head to higher ground.

00:19.977 --> 00:25.675
Due to increased demand, many gas stations
are finding their reserves insufficient.

00:27.202 --> 00:28.603
I'm out.

00:28.699 --> 00:29.703
No more.

00:30.403 --> 00:31.903
No more gas.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.116
What's going on here?

00:40.904 --> 00:43.116
What are you doing up there?
What's taking so long?

00:43.404 --> 00:44.616
It's out of money.

00:44.632 --> 00:46.001
Where is the closest ATM?

00:46.033 --> 00:47.654
This is the third place I've been to.

00:48.205 --> 00:53.100
Home improvement stores are being inundated as locals
are stocking up in preparation of this tsunami.

00:53.131 --> 00:57.215
A more common to this emotion occurrence, this
particular tsunami in the

00:57.216 --> 01:01.300
Atlantic was engendered
by a large portion of the Cumbre Vieja Volcano

01:01.314 --> 01:04.727
in the Canari island, collapsed 8 hours ago
sending water reported

01:04.763 --> 01:08.759
to be 100 meters high
rising for forth of south coast.

01:10.285 --> 01:11.104
Hey.

01:12.192 --> 01:14.206
- What's the hell wrong with you?
- I'm sorry, it's an accident.

01:14.238 --> 01:15.104
Look at my car!

01:15.119 --> 01:16.725
Hey look buddy she said it was an accident

01:16.756 --> 01:18.283
Screw you

01:18.299 --> 01:19.810
Stop it, Dan!

01:20.644 --> 01:22.800
Stop it.
Stop damn!

01:22.829 --> 01:25.048
Stop! Stop it!

01:46.390 --> 01:51.143
- I can't... breathe...
- Are you kidding me?

02:13.069 --> 02:15.037
Two bodies and the wave hasn't even hit yet.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.924
Well evacuations have a way making
people crazy Franck.

02:18.956 --> 02:22.009
According to witnesses there were a
dust out in the parking lot.

02:22.110 --> 02:24.676
When it was over some of the rovers
found these two.

02:24.707 --> 02:28.154
So you have inmate tats,
prison buff.

02:28.611 --> 02:31.050
And we have a coed,
I don't see the connection.

02:31.082 --> 02:35.300
Our female victim is a Virginia Dickens.
Here visiting a student at Miami.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.785
- They were heading inland.
- But she made a stop first.

02:37.816 --> 02:41.736
Yeah the guy was so pissed he wouldn't get out
of the car. Looks like she walk up on something.

02:41.751 --> 02:45.938
So that means that the killer's
real target is the ex-con.

02:46.269 --> 02:48.110
Is it a puncture wound Alexx?

02:48.155 --> 02:51.869
Right to the temple.
Killer left no room for error.

02:52.735 --> 02:55.710
ID does Leon Caldwell.

02:55.726 --> 03:01.234
- All cash, no credit cards.
- It is hard to get credit cards sent to a cell.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.666
What do we have there Alexx?

03:06.382 --> 03:09.923
Oh Sig Sauer, and loaded.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.922
Fresh out of jail and already packing huh?

03:11.954 --> 03:14.409
Look what I've found in his pocket.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.678
Frank...

03:21.009 --> 03:22.614
Take a look at that...

03:22.630 --> 03:26.754
5.7 x 28 millimetres, not from this gun.

03:26.785 --> 03:30.216
That's a monster calibre.
Penetrates up to 48 layers of Kevlar.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.677
Something tells me this guy was
planning something big...

03:32.686 --> 03:34.154
And not alone...

03:34.175 --> 03:38.602
Frank, it turns out the wave is not
the only thing about to hit Miami...

04:36.658 --> 04:38.783
It's still time for you to evacuate.

04:39.826 --> 04:42.902
Just following your lead.
I figured there's a reason you staying put.

04:43.114 --> 04:44.605
Well there is.

04:45.039 --> 04:46.425
We've found these.

04:46.821 --> 04:50.168
5.7 x 28, significant wounding potential.

04:50.309 --> 04:52.551
We think he has a partner and a plan.

04:53.115 --> 04:55.052
You're thinking a heist.

04:55.261 --> 05:01.026
Alright, 1500 banks in the area, hundreds of
armoured cars, hotels, saves, art museums,

05:01.038 --> 05:02.705
- billionaires states.
- Right.

05:02.729 --> 05:04.408
This is the rent-a-car.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.493
That is the shopping cart.
Get Eric out here, please.

05:07.529 --> 05:09.407
Right now. It's the window to the heist.

05:09.431 --> 05:10.218
Yep.

05:10.488 --> 05:13.505
Be alert, seven hours and counting.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.852
We got lucky...

05:49.040 --> 05:50.813
Someone stepped on this one.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.840
And an exemplar.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.629
Lot of hairs on the driver's seat.

06:08.318 --> 06:09.656
White hairs.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.789
Ha, they're closed up,
insurance reasons.

06:14.071 --> 06:16.090
Our killer left behind

06:16.123 --> 06:18.507
15 foot emergency fire ladder,

06:18.530 --> 06:21.959
30 feet of vinyl tubing,
and a mini maglite.

06:22.746 --> 06:25.294
If they needed it before,
they still need it.

06:25.444 --> 06:29.330
Changed towards the closing, couple of mom and
pop hardware stores are probably still open.

06:29.624 --> 06:32.160
I'll got hit a few,
starting with the closest.

06:32.172 --> 06:34.990
Alright, I'm gonna go with you Tripp.
Calleigh you take care of this?

06:35.018 --> 06:36.227
You know it.

06:44.185 --> 06:45.100
- Good night
- Hey.

06:45.124 --> 06:46.204
Are you leaving?

06:46.239 --> 06:49.093
Huh... normally I would stay here and stick
this out especially being new and all.

06:49.116 --> 06:50.678
Oh, no one would fault you for evacuating.

06:50.699 --> 06:54.245
No I have an uncle, a stubborn uncle,
he lives on Count in North Miami beach.

06:54.268 --> 06:55.666
He's refusing to evacuate?

06:55.677 --> 07:00.104
He says he lived through 4 hurricanes this season alone
and not gonna let some other wave chase him out.

07:00.279 --> 07:02.205
I called a bunch of times,
he's not picking up the phone.

07:02.216 --> 07:03.801
Well, maybe that means he's gone already.

07:03.825 --> 07:05.715
I just wanna make sure...
can you clear it with the LT?

07:05.727 --> 07:08.803
Yeah. And just see you know they've closed
Eastbound Broad and Kennedy Crossways

07:08.827 --> 07:10.800
That's why I get the brass pass.

07:10.820 --> 07:12.535
Be careful out there!

07:30.366 --> 07:32.996
Hi Charlie, how's hardware business treating you?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.557
Hey Frank...

07:34.581 --> 07:36.342
You got that wire problem figured out yet?

07:36.366 --> 07:38.174
You bet, just did what you told me to do.

07:38.195 --> 07:42.093
By any chance you sold any of these
provisions to someone in the last hours?

07:42.152 --> 07:43.761
Yours is the third place we've been.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.498
Closing up after this guy.

07:45.651 --> 07:48.117
He went around when I dug out some silicone.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.128
I think he's still over there loading his car.

07:50.151 --> 07:52.265
- Thanks.
- Thank you Charlie.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.359
Excuse me...

07:58.486 --> 07:59.754
Miami Dade PD

07:59.777 --> 08:01.245
Crime Lab.

08:01.292 --> 08:03.312
Really shouldn't you two be working
traffic or something?

08:03.335 --> 08:04.721
Can I see your license?

08:10.686 --> 08:12.025
Steve Riddick?

08:12.048 --> 08:12.753
That's right.

08:12.776 --> 08:14.467
Mind if we have a look inside your car?

08:14.490 --> 08:15.406
You got a warrant?

08:15.430 --> 08:17.661
- Not yet.
- Well, you can search it when you get one.

08:17.682 --> 08:21.251
Well according to the hardware store
owner you purchased these items.

08:23.201 --> 08:26.136
- So?
- So we got a dead guy in a hardware chain

08:26.159 --> 08:27.944
that bought the same things.

08:29.845 --> 08:32.592
Do you mind if I've a look at the
bottom of your shoes?

08:35.914 --> 08:37.405
Orange pulp.

08:37.428 --> 08:39.518
Yeah there's craps all over my mats too.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.631
I like crap,
it just got you arrested.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.087
You got to be kidding me!

08:43.135 --> 08:44.321
Turn around.

08:59.611 --> 09:00.551
Alexx.

09:00.633 --> 09:01.748
Thought you got lost?

09:01.772 --> 09:04.989
Yes, inland traffic... What can you tell
me about the weapon used on the victim?

09:05.387 --> 09:07.782
A quarter inch in diameter,
two inches deep.

09:07.806 --> 09:09.203
And look at this...

09:09.661 --> 09:12.268
- The weapon is cylindrical.
- Right.

09:12.301 --> 09:17.655
The edges of the wound scrape belong side the weapon,
creating a circumferential margin abrasion.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.379
Opened this and brain dead.

09:22.385 --> 09:24.229
So significant force.

09:24.252 --> 09:27.094
You find the weapon,
I can compare the tool mark.

09:27.176 --> 09:28.749
Found something else Horatio,

09:28.773 --> 09:30.217
in his longs.

09:32.575 --> 09:35.276
Normal bronchial tube are pinking the last tick,

09:35.288 --> 09:38.810
his bronchial tubes have significant fibrosis.

09:39.675 --> 09:41.131
So, he had trouble breathing.

09:41.382 --> 09:44.597
Based on the thickness of his neck,
I'm thinking chronic apnea

09:44.654 --> 09:47.219
Shortness of breath that can lead to unconsciousness.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.541
Not a guy you can count on.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.572
Alexx, you've just discovered our motive.

09:50.706 --> 09:51.375
I did?

09:51.376 --> 09:52.486
You did.

09:52.487 --> 09:53.808
Let me know if I was right.

09:53.846 --> 09:55.053
Yes.

09:59.937 --> 10:02.157
A shopping list and an orange,
and you want to charge me

10:02.158 --> 10:04.092
with two murders? Come
on, get out of here.

10:04.514 --> 10:06.236
We're figuring the lady
walked up on you while you were

10:06.237 --> 10:08.305
puncturing your pal Leon's temple.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.316
Nice fantasy.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.307
And why'd I kill Leon?

10:12.342 --> 10:13.782
Because Leon has apnea.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.348
Ap-a-what?

10:15.367 --> 10:17.530
Apnea means you go unconscious

10:17.531 --> 10:19.618
with no notice. Not exactly the type of

10:19.638 --> 10:21.572
guy you want on your crew for a heist.

10:26.992 --> 10:28.351
There's a heist?

10:28.524 --> 10:29.557
Really?

10:29.558 --> 10:30.974
I want to know about this.

10:30.975 --> 10:32.296
Yeah, well, so do we.

10:32.334 --> 10:34.288
Bullets tell us it's a big job.

10:34.460 --> 10:35.819
We figure you got a
little more manpower.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.485
Why don't you whip out some names?

10:37.486 --> 10:39.401
I'm not giving you mooks anything.

10:40.168 --> 10:41.144
And

10:41.164 --> 10:42.542
I've got a news flash.

10:42.849 --> 10:44.266
You're not going to get me for her

10:44.553 --> 10:45.760
or for him.

10:46.009 --> 10:47.349
My lawyer's on his way.

10:47.617 --> 10:48.977
Book him, Frank.

10:49.168 --> 10:51.141
I 've got a news flash for you.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.190
I'm going to get you.

11:00.156 --> 11:01.399
I assumed that you
and Ray Junior would be

11:01.400 --> 11:02.644
heading north by now.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.579
My mom took him inland to a hotel.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.264
What is that?

11:12.796 --> 11:14.763
Um, I was bending down to get a

11:14.798 --> 11:17.021
pot out of the cabinet and I hit my eye.

11:17.116 --> 11:18.150
Yelina.

11:18.151 --> 11:19.223
We're fine.

11:19.224 --> 11:20.795
Yelina... where is he?

11:22.289 --> 11:23.745
Horatio, it's not what you think.

11:23.994 --> 11:26.887
How many times have I heard
a woman in the field say that?

11:27.442 --> 11:28.649
Lieutenant Caine.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.771
Rebecca Nevins.

11:31.772 --> 11:33.304
From the State Attorney's office.

11:33.362 --> 11:34.645
I'll be with you in a second.

11:36.484 --> 11:38.362
To be continued, Yelina.

11:38.687 --> 11:40.450
There is nothing to be continued.

11:45.431 --> 11:46.925
You've arrested Steve Riddick.

11:47.212 --> 11:49.031
Yes, I did, for murder.

11:49.032 --> 11:50.334
Your CSI checked his car.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.596
Couldn't find any of the items
on the hardware store list.

11:52.615 --> 11:54.434
Mr. Riddick was at the store.

11:54.435 --> 11:56.753
I am confident that he
stashed the items somewhere.

11:56.791 --> 11:58.975
And the orange from the
victim and Riddick's shoes?

11:59.607 --> 12:00.747
Pulp's not unique.

12:00.782 --> 12:01.887
This guy is right.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.380
I file this, judge kicks it.

12:03.381 --> 12:04.285
It's a lose/lose.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.868
I don't think we want this
man on the street, do you?

12:08.151 --> 12:10.727
Rearrest him when you can bring
me more compelling evidence.

12:14.877 --> 12:15.663
Frank.

12:15.682 --> 12:16.831
Yeah.

12:23.172 --> 12:24.572
Cooler heads prevailed,

12:24.607 --> 12:25.973
Just beat it, will you?

12:28.881 --> 12:30.245
We're gonna let him walk?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.026
I have no choice.

12:31.027 --> 12:32.859
Put a radio car on him, please.

12:42.207 --> 12:43.755
Do you think the lab
is going to get hit?

12:43.816 --> 12:45.609
We're inland enough
and on the third floor.

12:45.655 --> 12:47.646
I think the worst place to be
right now is near the beach.

12:47.647 --> 12:48.658
Did you get anything for me?

12:48.659 --> 12:51.567
I got to pack up, but I did look at
the hairs from the car and the clothes

12:51.602 --> 12:52.506
of your male victim.

12:52.557 --> 12:53.875
Leon Caldwell?

12:54.166 --> 12:55.530
Roots are spade shaped.

12:55.714 --> 12:57.139
That only means one thing

12:57.783 --> 12:59.008
dog hairs.

12:59.009 --> 13:00.158
Short-haired breed.

13:00.159 --> 13:02.550
I counted 17 different
specimens from the tape lifts.

13:02.672 --> 13:04.220
From a kennel or a vet maybe.

13:04.946 --> 13:06.325
All the hairs are from greyhound.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.685
Greyhound. Dog races.

13:08.731 --> 13:10.065
Popular in Miami.

13:10.110 --> 13:11.413
Thanks, Aaron.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.817
Sounds like the dogs
have been evacuated.

13:29.346 --> 13:31.522
Miami-Dade Police. Are you in charge?

13:41.298 --> 13:42.770
We'd love to meet him too.

13:48.271 --> 13:49.957
Cages for 24 greyhounds.

13:55.810 --> 13:57.879
This explains the dog
hair on our victim.

13:59.749 --> 14:00.867
Manny...

14:01.067 --> 14:02.630
does he seem familiar to you?

14:02.948 --> 14:04.148
Familiar

14:04.305 --> 14:05.519
No.

14:07.319 --> 14:08.619
Hurricane glass.

14:09.005 --> 14:10.405
There's a hole in the top.

14:10.905 --> 14:12.648
It seems almost experimental.

14:13.948 --> 14:17.505
Manny, were you, Riddick and
Leon doing trial runs here?

14:35.154 --> 14:36.997
Where is it supposed to happen?

14:38.140 --> 14:39.554
I want a lawyer.

14:39.725 --> 14:41.139
You know what, my friend?
You're going to get a lawyer.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.554
Turn around.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.756
Find the window, find the
caper, right, Calleigh?

14:47.070 --> 14:48.342
You got it.

14:50.899 --> 14:52.070
Delko.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.826
Eric, is it possible to locate

14:53.827 --> 14:56.427
a building based on the
size of its hurricane window?

14:57.827 --> 14:59.970
Five feet nine inches by 11.

15:00.113 --> 15:02.013
That doesn't sound like a standard size,

15:02.141 --> 15:04.335
which means it would
have to be custom made

15:04.370 --> 15:06.512
and subject to Florida
code requirements.

15:18.992 --> 15:22.978
Golden Beach Bank and Trust.

15:23.053 --> 15:24.711
Dispatch, this is CSI Duquesne.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.024
We're going to need a welfare check

15:26.025 --> 15:27.339
on Golden Beach Bank and Trust.

15:27.353 --> 15:29.053
Manny, how many guys on your crew?

15:30.325 --> 15:32.182
Look, I don't know. I-I
just do my part, man.

15:32.539 --> 15:34.610
A radio car's rolling. There's no ETA.

15:34.710 --> 15:35.968
PD's spread pretty thin.

15:36.010 --> 15:40.401
Eric, meet me at the corner of Ocean
and Golden Beach, please. Thank you.

15:40.436 --> 15:41.739
Calleigh, book him.

15:48.327 --> 15:50.127
Uncle Ron? You in here?

15:54.811 --> 15:56.239
You listened after all.

15:57.568 --> 15:58.868
Excuse me.

15:59.482 --> 16:01.296
Are you Ronald's nephew?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.817
Yes, ma'am. I'm Ryan.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.760
I'm Mona. I live next door.

16:05.146 --> 16:07.274
Ronald talks about you all the time.

16:07.331 --> 16:08.559
Did my uncle evacuate?

16:08.560 --> 16:09.845
He ran out of here,

16:09.846 --> 16:12.875
tried to get me to go with him, but
I think they're all overreacting.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.495
The skies are blue. There's
not a breeze in the air.

16:15.617 --> 16:17.331
This isn't a hurricane, ma'am.

16:17.374 --> 16:19.599
Tidal wave doesn't give
notice, it just hits and

16:19.634 --> 16:21.454
it could take out this entire structure.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.614
I see.

16:24.729 --> 16:26.186
I'll get my things.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.879
My, but that is a low tide.

16:39.050 --> 16:40.407
And it's getting lower.

16:41.379 --> 16:42.849
If I didn't have my contacts in,

16:42.850 --> 16:44.850
I'd swear the ocean was disappearing.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.207
It is.

16:50.021 --> 16:51.721
The bad news is, it's
going to come back.

16:52.464 --> 16:53.792
We gotta get out of here.

16:54.435 --> 16:55.978
No, Mona, we're going
to stay right here.

16:56.621 --> 16:57.706
Right here.

16:57.707 --> 16:59.264
This thing is going to be a monster.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.790
Shots fired at Golden State Bank.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.790
Requesting backup. Every available unit.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.421
Robbery in progress.

17:14.749 --> 17:16.078
Copy that.

17:26.926 --> 17:28.298
They've got a machine gun.

17:31.127 --> 17:33.155
Stay on the ground! Nobody move!

17:33.427 --> 17:34.813
I said nobody move!

17:38.172 --> 17:39.572
I told you, nobody moves!

17:39.629 --> 17:40.815
Hey!

17:51.260 --> 17:53.131
Eric. Check the other shooter.

17:56.446 --> 17:57.760
We're clear!

17:58.410 --> 17:59.624
Hey! Lie down! You,

17:59.625 --> 18:01.410
Sir, get your hands up! Right now!

18:02.796 --> 18:04.352
That's my wife. She's been shot.

18:04.353 --> 18:05.867
She's losing a lot of blood.

18:08.181 --> 18:08.880
Okay.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.181
Give me your necktie.

18:10.753 --> 18:12.180
Okay, ma'am, I'm going
to take care of you.

18:12.181 --> 18:14.253
Here we go. Here's what
I need you to do, sir.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.302
I want you to hold this tight.

18:16.337 --> 18:17.838
- Eric?
- They have P90's.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.565
It's the same ammo as Leon Caldwell.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.981
Is Riddick there?

18:21.738 --> 18:22.680
No.

18:22.681 --> 18:24.080
No money bags, either.

18:24.081 --> 18:26.495
Other teller drawers are open,
but there's no cash anywhere.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.730
I need the bank manager!

18:28.731 --> 18:30.387
I am the bank manager. Scott Riley.

18:30.388 --> 18:32.758
Mr. Riley, somebody is
missing. Do you understand?

18:32.759 --> 18:34.016
Yeah. One of them went out that way.

18:34.017 --> 18:35.801
He took the elevator
once the shooting started.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.573
Okay, he probably took
the money with him.

18:38.259 --> 18:39.572
Oh, my God.

18:39.573 --> 18:41.045
Look at that horizon.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.002
That...

18:43.502 --> 18:45.145
is not the horizon.

18:53.761 --> 18:55.947
Eric, get all these people together.

18:56.190 --> 18:56.718
Let's go, people.

18:56.753 --> 18:57.347
Mister Riley,

18:57.390 --> 18:58.860
Where's the vault?

18:58.861 --> 19:00.260
It's, uh, down that landing.

19:00.261 --> 19:01.560
Only I can open it.

19:01.561 --> 19:03.017
Listen to me. Here's
what I want you to do.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.517
I want you to assemble all these

19:04.518 --> 19:05.874
people and take them to the vault,

19:05.875 --> 19:07.317
No way, man. I'm not leaving my wife.

19:07.318 --> 19:09.590
Listen to me. Take
them to the vault. Go.

19:10.007 --> 19:11.636
Go. I'll take care of her.

19:14.707 --> 19:15.664
Come on, people

19:15.673 --> 19:16.987
Let's go,

19:17.887 --> 19:19.701
Everybody, let's go.
Let's get it together.

19:20.501 --> 19:21.137
Follow me!

19:21.172 --> 19:22.701
Hold my neck. You ready?

19:22.915 --> 19:24.244
Close your eyes.

19:55.243 --> 19:56.557
Who was that?

20:03.683 --> 20:04.869
Is that one of the robbers?

20:04.883 --> 20:06.440
Oh, my God, that's the
outside of this vault.

20:09.269 --> 20:10.626
We're going to drown in here.

20:45.933 --> 20:47.162
Wave receded back.

20:47.176 --> 20:48.546
Yeah, that's the way it looks.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.519
Okay, folks, we're going
to have a look around.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.576
Stay put. Come on, Eric.

21:08.598 --> 21:10.369
Even the hurricane glass blew out.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.906
This guy managed to stay put.

21:20.963 --> 21:22.377
The debris pinned him in here.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.149
Well,

21:25.334 --> 21:27.434
no doubt his partner will not turn up.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.692
That guy's halfway to Cuba by now.

21:35.183 --> 21:36.583
So we get this one...

21:38.355 --> 21:39.769
and the thief...

21:40.440 --> 21:41.755
...gets away.

21:42.072 --> 21:43.400
With the cash.

21:44.272 --> 21:46.243
That's a 5.7.28, Eric.

21:46.343 --> 21:47.451
That seems familiar.

21:47.486 --> 21:50.029
Yeah. Why waste that firepower
in the ceiling, though?

21:50.915 --> 21:51.679
Scare them?

21:51.714 --> 21:53.370
When one of these is discharged,

21:53.371 --> 21:55.771
people hit the deck, don't
they? Imagine a hundred.

22:01.214 --> 22:03.286
Something is going on, Eric.

22:07.127 --> 22:11.786
Miami Beach was hit by a 30-foot
tsunami at 2:57 p.m. today.

22:11.801 --> 22:15.720
Preliminary reports indicate the damage
was confined primarily to the coast.

22:15.736 --> 22:19.565
At present, no deaths have been
directly attributed to the surge,

22:19.566 --> 22:23.511
thanks, in part, to the ten-hour
warning and mandatory evacuations.

22:24.982 --> 22:28.177
Mona, do you think you'll be allright
here, or can I take you somewhere?

22:29.883 --> 22:30.686
Wolfe.

22:31.237 --> 22:33.362
Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

22:34.007 --> 22:36.384
The roof? Do you know
how dangerous that is?

22:36.416 --> 22:39.092
Uncle Ron, when I said higher ground...

22:39.313 --> 22:40.808
Locked? Which door?

22:41.784 --> 22:43.641
Stay there. I'll be right up.

22:43.672 --> 22:45.435
He's on the roof of this building?

22:45.467 --> 22:48.048
Yeah, he locked himself up
there. I'm going to go let him in.

22:48.064 --> 22:49.480
It was nice meeting you.

22:51.659 --> 22:53.673
It's ok baby, I'll be
with you the whole way.

22:53.689 --> 22:55.704
Sorry, sir. Only the injured ride today.

22:56.994 --> 22:58.080
What? Well, where are you taking her?

22:58.096 --> 23:00.504
Any trauma center with room.
We'll call you when she's admitted.

23:00.533 --> 23:03.036
Scott, it's... it's okay.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.326
Okay. I'll be with you right away.

23:06.877 --> 23:08.419
Okay? It's going to be all right.

23:09.049 --> 23:09.914
Bye, baby.

23:16.387 --> 23:18.512
I've got something in my
car to help clean that up.

23:18.543 --> 23:20.038
Oh, it's... it's okay.

23:20.070 --> 23:21.981
Listen, before you go,
we need to, uh, ask you

23:21.982 --> 23:23.973
a few questions about
that robber that got away.

23:24.005 --> 23:26.067
Look, it was mayhem.

23:26.193 --> 23:28.947
After my wife got shot,
I... I focused on her.

23:28.967 --> 23:30.840
Can you give us any description at all?

23:31.044 --> 23:32.713
He was wearing a mask
like the other guys.

23:32.729 --> 23:36.113
Uh, he's a white guy...
medium height, medium build.

23:36.144 --> 23:37.498
Could it be this guy?

23:37.513 --> 23:39.355
His name's Steve Riddick.

23:41.747 --> 23:43.007
Maybe.

23:43.316 --> 23:46.905
Look, uh, can I go now, see my wife?

23:46.937 --> 23:48.731
Yeah, sure, we'll,
uh, we'll be in touch.

23:48.362 --> 23:49.228
Thanks.

23:52.787 --> 23:53.867
Tell you what, Eric.

23:53.948 --> 23:55.404
That guy's a little hinky.

23:55.439 --> 23:56.801
Yeah, you need to get into it.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.882
Hear patrol lost Riddick.

24:15.258 --> 24:17.759
Yes, to a little thing
called a tidal wave.

24:18.182 --> 24:19.509
Scene secure?

24:20.049 --> 24:22.526
Rick, don't you have
somewhere else to be right now?

24:22.550 --> 24:24.910
You and Delko killed
two robbery suspects.

24:24.928 --> 24:26.313
That makes this the place for me to be.

24:26.337 --> 24:28.814
Should we mention the ten
hostages they were holding?

24:28.826 --> 24:30.387
You know I need to take a closer look.

24:30.411 --> 24:32.219
Why don't you take a look in the mirror?

24:34.904 --> 24:36.888
You got something you want to say to me?

24:37.417 --> 24:39.225
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:39.648 --> 24:41.785
I saw what you did to her face.

24:42.466 --> 24:46.035
If by "her", you mean
Yelina, she bumped her face.

24:46.045 --> 24:47.959
You're blaming me for an accident?

24:47.982 --> 24:50.084
I'm going to say this to you once.

24:50.812 --> 24:53.184
If you ever touch her
again, I'm going to kill you.

24:55.485 --> 24:57.106
She loved your brother...

24:57.582 --> 24:58.651
not you.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.835
Do yourself a favor, man.

25:01.610 --> 25:02.596
Move on.

25:04.298 --> 25:05.989
You heard what I said.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.580
Give me your firearm.
I need to investigate.

25:09.779 --> 25:10.496
Fine.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.116
Fair enough.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.159
So, this is your crime scene?

25:15.284 --> 25:16.916
Standard operating procedure.

25:16.951 --> 25:17.785
Good.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.499
We have a lot of work to do.

25:19.522 --> 25:23.526
We're gonna start with you baby-sitting
the body till the M.E. gets here.

25:23.888 --> 25:25.262
He's all yours.

25:27.805 --> 25:28.803
Hey, Eric.

25:28.839 --> 25:30.835
Any luck I.D.ing our dead robber?

25:30.844 --> 25:34.038
Yeah. Took AFIS about two
minutes to pull this guy out.

25:38.006 --> 25:40.038
Armed robbery is his specialty.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.961
Man, Riddick really knows
how to put together a team.

25:42.985 --> 25:44.958
Yeah. How'd you do?

25:45.169 --> 25:47.623
Matched the rounds from
the robbery to two P90's.

25:47.670 --> 25:50.711
The ones from the elevator matched
the one in Mrs. Riley's leg.

25:50.814 --> 25:54.255
He was aiming at his partner,
who got away with the money.

25:54.431 --> 25:57.061
Explains why we didn't find any cash.

26:04.497 --> 26:06.340
Shooting at his own guy?

26:06.234 --> 26:08.324
The robbers turned on each other.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.421
It's not a team I'd want to be on.

26:18.026 --> 26:19.212
Mrs. Riley.

26:19.587 --> 26:21.994
- Hi.
- I just stopped by to see how you're doing.

26:22.253 --> 26:24.249
Surgeons saved my leg.

26:24.869 --> 26:26.736
But you saved my life.

26:27.358 --> 26:29.026
You saved all our lives.

26:29.178 --> 26:31.034
I'm just glad you're okay.

26:31.268 --> 26:32.842
Have you seen my husband?

26:33.100 --> 26:34.333
Um...

26:34.994 --> 26:39.467
No. I-I... I guess I assumed
he's still at the bank.

26:40.794 --> 26:45.197
I knew you'd need Scott to hang
around for statements and all that...

26:46.314 --> 26:47.758
but I'd really like to see him.

26:47.793 --> 26:50.459
Okay, um... you know what?

26:50.482 --> 26:52.361
Let me see what I can do about that.

26:52.384 --> 26:53.664
I'm glad you're okay.

26:53.688 --> 26:54.275
Thanks.

26:54.298 --> 26:55.296
Talk to you later.

26:57.837 --> 27:02.229
Frank, send a uniform over to Scott
Riley's house. Something's not right.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.497
Yeah, I'm here right now.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.458
Something about Riley didn't sit right.

27:05.481 --> 27:06.655
He's nowhere to be found.

27:06.676 --> 27:08.449
Okay, so he's in the wind.

27:08.473 --> 27:11.584
Yeah. Found a, uh, bank employee
folder sitting on the table.

27:11.608 --> 27:15.037
It was opened up to an address
in Uleta, a Farley Wheeler.

27:15.117 --> 27:17.183
Get Eric and go over there, please.

27:17.207 --> 27:18.627
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you got it.

27:38.564 --> 27:39.973
I should kill you!

27:39.994 --> 27:40.758
Hey, wait, wait.

27:40.781 --> 27:42.014
They weren't supposed to hurt anyone.

27:42.026 --> 27:43.505
You didn't think I would recognize you?

27:43.517 --> 27:46.217
I swear, I didn't know
it was gonna be like that.

27:46.241 --> 27:47.720
I know where you live.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.129
Please don't do this.

27:49.151 --> 27:50.983
You almost killed my wife!

27:51.605 --> 27:53.296
You son of a bitch!

27:53.542 --> 27:55.479
Guy's already shot.

27:55.503 --> 27:57.722
Let the cops get him.

27:57.745 --> 27:59.413
He shot my wife!

27:59.777 --> 28:01.291
He robbed my bank.

28:01.315 --> 28:02.677
You know this for sure?

28:02.956 --> 28:05.234
Yeah. I recognized his shoes.

28:05.257 --> 28:06.608
Same ones every day.

28:06.631 --> 28:08.592
Ugly ass shoes, huh, Farley?

28:08.886 --> 28:10.177
He's my swing teller.

28:10.201 --> 28:11.715
Best hours at the bank.

28:24.933 --> 28:26.471
He's stupid.

28:26.494 --> 28:29.171
What are you gonna solve by killing him?

28:30.298 --> 28:33.949
Think of your wife having
to come see you in the pen.

28:35.863 --> 28:36.685
Think.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.693
Think.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.860
You're right.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.077
Okay?

28:57.182 --> 28:59.390
Miami P.D.! Drop your weapon.

28:59.730 --> 29:00.728
Don't hurt me!

29:01.113 --> 29:03.285
Oh, God! Don't hurt me.

29:04.342 --> 29:05.481
Drop it now!

29:05.493 --> 29:07.724
You can't match a nine
millimeter with a P90.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.978
Yeah, well, I disagree, so
I guess we've got a problem.

29:09.990 --> 29:10.636
Mm-hmm.

29:11.162 --> 29:12.911
Now, I'm gonna back
out of here with him.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.250
Don't move!

29:14.273 --> 29:15.436
Don't you move!

29:16.110 --> 29:20.278
I see you stick your head out the
door, and I'm gonna blow it off.

29:20.347 --> 29:21.427
Come on!

29:22.202 --> 29:23.576
Come on!

29:31.535 --> 29:33.249
Scooped up this Wheeler guy out front.

29:33.261 --> 29:34.212
What's his connection?

29:34.224 --> 29:36.478
He's the third robber.
Riddick's on the move.

29:58.608 --> 30:00.322
You know, all this doesn't add up.

30:00.367 --> 30:02.905
If Leon Caldwell and Steve
Riddick needed this hardware

30:02.940 --> 30:06.109
equipment so bad, why didn't
they use it in the bank robbery?

30:06.144 --> 30:11.040
They practice breaking bank windows,
and then didn't do so during the robbery.

30:11.538 --> 30:13.921
Well, here's the weird
thing. Take a look.

30:14.391 --> 30:16.422
Manny's clothing from the dog track.

30:16.434 --> 30:18.583
There's RDX all over them.

30:19.802 --> 30:21.422
Explosives.

30:21.692 --> 30:23.759
But no one used explosives
in the bank robbery.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.461
Not that we know of.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.541
Back to the bank?

30:26.565 --> 30:28.585
The one common denominator.

30:29.149 --> 30:30.124
Let's go.

30:32.824 --> 30:34.386
Third floor's a mortgage broker.

30:34.398 --> 30:36.288
Four and five are more bank offices.

30:36.311 --> 30:37.627
What about the second floor?

30:37.803 --> 30:39.106
Nothing's listed in the lobby.

30:39.151 --> 30:40.384
Let's start there.

30:40.407 --> 30:41.863
The stairs are right over here.

30:52.045 --> 30:53.889
Well, well, well.

30:54.863 --> 30:56.589
Is that what I think it is?

30:56.988 --> 31:00.182
Yes, and the thieves counted on it.

31:06.386 --> 31:09.216
Two vaults, one security system.

31:09.636 --> 31:13.605
The machine guns were used to cover
up the sound of the explosion upstairs.

31:13.629 --> 31:16.200
So the cash they grabbed
downstairs was just a diversion.

31:29.152 --> 31:31.430
This is not about the cash, is it?

31:31.510 --> 31:34.246
It's about the gold.

31:50.811 --> 31:52.091
Center punch.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.897
Used it to punch a hole in the window.

31:55.073 --> 31:57.844
Weakened the frame, and
let the tsunami do the rest.

32:10.076 --> 32:11.907
Some kind of treated nylon.

32:11.936 --> 32:13.474
Heavy-duty and waterproof.

32:13.545 --> 32:16.339
Possibly from a flotation
device of some kind.

32:16.351 --> 32:21.095
So, they let the water do the heavy
lifting, let the gold float out to sea.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.037
And then wait.

32:33.697 --> 32:36.561
Wonder how they expect to find it
all in the middle of the tsunami.

32:36.962 --> 32:40.762
I don't know, but let's start tracking 
this flotation material back to its owner.

32:45.275 --> 32:46.609
I had P.D. run a search.

32:46.644 --> 32:49.323
Came back to a Dr. Greismer at Miami.

32:52.851 --> 32:54.755
So you haven't seen Professor Greismer?

32:54.790 --> 32:56.625
We share an office, not much more.

32:56.959 --> 32:57.678
Okay.

32:57.713 --> 32:59.526
Well, when was the
last time you saw him?

32:59.561 --> 33:00.361
Couple days.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.482
I'll try and answer your questions,
but I'm not the tsunami expert.

33:04.517 --> 33:05.171
I'm hurricanes.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.515
I can't believe Greismer's not around.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.430
A tsunami's a once in a lifetime event.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.477
Well, if you don't mind, I'm
gonna have a look for a number.

33:11.512 --> 33:13.652
He's a pack rat, but if
you can find something...

33:14.542 --> 33:15.034
Thanks.

33:15.069 --> 33:16.079
You're welcome.

33:26.987 --> 33:28.754
Professor Greismer,
thank you for coming in.

33:29.210 --> 33:33.041
We're thinking that those lift bags may
have been used in a bank robbery scheme.

33:33.076 --> 33:35.847
I looked for them for
hours before the tsunami.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.571
I couldn't remember where I put them.

33:38.606 --> 33:41.226
That's an awfully big thing to misplace.

33:41.261 --> 33:44.807
We believe the bank robbers
exploited the tidal wave

33:44.842 --> 33:47.866
in order to extract a large amount
of gold from the second story vault.

33:47.601 --> 33:49.362
Actually, "tidal wave" is a misnomer.

33:49.397 --> 33:51.301
It was a volcano that caused that surge.

33:51.336 --> 33:53.607
So your research came in handy,

33:53.642 --> 33:54.606
didn't it?

33:54.641 --> 33:58.221
And you think I helped
with this... this robbery?

33:58.256 --> 33:59.169
Did you?

33:59.204 --> 34:02.550
No. I've been studying ways to
use the energy for useful purposes,

34:02.585 --> 34:03.925
not criminal ones.

34:04.091 --> 34:07.430
Dr. Greismer, how far in advance
would you know a tsunami was coming?

34:07.465 --> 34:11.331
Well, we've known about the fragility
of the Cumbre Vieja volcano for years,

34:11.366 --> 34:14.507
but even the experts couldn't
predict when the collapse would occur.

34:14.205 --> 34:17.463
Actually, the tsunami and the
hurricane're very similar in that regard.

34:17.498 --> 34:19.483
They both cause water to rise,

34:19.518 --> 34:21.433
you know, cause extreme flooding,

34:21.467 --> 34:23.860
and then carry the flooded
water back out to sea.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.833
And Miami has a hurricane
season, which is predictable.

34:26.868 --> 34:27.980
We average one a year.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.484
Of course, this last
season was an anomaly.

34:30.518 --> 34:31.306
We had four.

34:31.341 --> 34:34.931
Maybe the plan was for the hurricane,
but the tsunami just came sooner.

34:34.966 --> 34:36.452
The end result for both is the same.

34:36.487 --> 34:37.904
The end result was all that mattered.

34:37.938 --> 34:40.565
I think we've been talking
to the wrong expert.

34:41.487 --> 34:42.565
Mind if I smoke?

34:42.600 --> 34:43.559
As a matter of fact, I do.

34:43.594 --> 34:45.752
I want you to pay
attention to this, Leslie.

34:46.202 --> 34:48.331
We found your phone records, Professor.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.612
Found dozens of calls
between you and Steve Riddick.

34:52.856 --> 34:54.107
We're acquaintances.

34:54.996 --> 34:56.902
First contact was at your office.

34:56.937 --> 34:58.347
Steve had a brainstorm.

34:58.742 --> 35:01.439
He wanted to commit a
heist during a hurricane,

35:01.474 --> 35:03.187
and so he called an expert,

35:03.222 --> 35:04.537
you.

35:04.572 --> 35:07.450
Now, before long, a
hypothetical situation

35:07.485 --> 35:08.980
became a plan.

35:09.015 --> 35:12.321
By then, he had your home
phone, cell phone, pager.

35:12.356 --> 35:15.602
You basically bought
into his bad boy ways

35:15.637 --> 35:17.454
and decided to help him out.

35:17.489 --> 35:20.661
But Mother Nature threw
Steve a curve ball,

35:20.696 --> 35:23.494
and then he and the gang had
to shift to a hurry-up offense,

35:23.529 --> 35:24.271
didn't they?

35:26.506 --> 35:27.957
When do I get my phone call?

35:27.992 --> 35:29.614
As soon as you tell
me what I need to know.

35:30.410 --> 35:32.044
Where the gold is? I don't think so.

35:32.079 --> 35:34.316
How about, where is Scott Riley?

35:34.351 --> 35:35.193
Who?

35:35.228 --> 35:36.787
Your boyfriend's hostage.

35:37.180 --> 35:37.959
What?

35:39.785 --> 35:40.455
Steve took a...?

35:40.490 --> 35:42.488
Bad boys aren't so cute up close,

35:42.523 --> 35:43.271
are they?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.810
Where's your boyfriend, Leslie?

35:48.945 --> 35:50.136
I don't know.

35:50.171 --> 35:53.434
No calls between Leslie
and Steve Riddick all day.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.424
Let me put it to you another way.

35:55.459 --> 35:56.454
Where is Steve?

35:58.340 --> 36:00.628
He's obsessed with explosives...

36:02.048 --> 36:03.311
Oh, my God.

36:03.346 --> 36:05.312
Leslie, talk to me.

36:09.379 --> 36:11.028
There's a hotel

36:11.063 --> 36:12.642
old Art Deco place

36:12.677 --> 36:14.675
was set to be razed in a few months,

36:14.710 --> 36:16.674
but the surge damaged the foundations,

36:16.709 --> 36:18.122
making the structure hazardous.

36:19.201 --> 36:22.726
They moved up the demolition date, and
since the city's already been evacuated...

36:22.761 --> 36:24.333
The demolition date is today.

36:24.368 --> 36:25.108
Yeah.

36:25.143 --> 36:26.207
What is the name of the hotel?

36:26.818 --> 36:29.148
Leslie, the name of the hotel.

36:29.631 --> 36:32.105
The Sandmore... downtown.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.816
Eric, what do you got?

36:43.851 --> 36:46.445
Blasters say the explosives
are on a sequential time delay.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.247
How long to detonation?

36:47.282 --> 36:48.572
Two minutes, and the building implodes.

36:48.607 --> 36:49.827
He's in there. I know
he's in there, Eric.

36:49.862 --> 36:52.456
Look, the guy said they cleared
the building three hours ago.

36:52.491 --> 36:54.586
Three hours gives Riddick
long enough to stash him.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.416
H! Hope you can hear me.

37:14.451 --> 37:16.202
It's 5 seconds till detonation.

37:16.237 --> 37:17.954
You've gotta get out of there.

37:17.989 --> 37:19.257
Get out now!

37:23.356 --> 37:23.991
Scott!

37:24.422 --> 37:25.165
Scott!

37:25.985 --> 37:27.141
Scott, easy, buddy.

37:27.176 --> 37:28.297
Easy, buddy, easy.

37:30.050 --> 37:30.542
Oh, man!

37:30.577 --> 37:31.074
Here we go.

37:31.109 --> 37:31.571
Oh, my God!

37:32.649 --> 37:33.426
Here we go.

37:35.429 --> 37:36.272
Here we go.

38:26.101 --> 38:26.895
Lieutenant.

38:29.738 --> 38:31.520
I don't know what to say.

38:32.396 --> 38:35.064
Why don't you check on your wife, okay?

38:35.692 --> 38:36.293
Yeah.

38:37.975 --> 38:38.995
Thank you.

38:39.030 --> 38:40.311
You take care.

38:40.346 --> 38:41.785
Yes, Eric?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.358
You okay?

38:43.393 --> 38:44.861
I think so.

38:44.896 --> 38:47.526
I just got off the phone
with Detective Salas.

38:47.561 --> 38:49.502
The professor isn't so smart.

38:49.537 --> 38:51.409
She still won't give Riddick up.

38:51.444 --> 38:54.954
Well, then it's time to
educate the professor.

39:07.838 --> 39:08.588
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but

39:08.623 --> 39:12.581
with 3,000 square miles and
20,000 GPS units in this area,

39:13.055 --> 39:14.699
I just don't see how we can help you.

39:14.734 --> 39:16.343
What if I could narrow the field?

39:16.844 --> 39:18.099
Willing to try.

39:18.134 --> 39:20.216
Uh, is the receiver unique in some way?

39:20.251 --> 39:22.140
I don't think this is a receiver.

39:22.175 --> 39:26.047
Sir, uh, 99 percent of GPS units
out there are just receivers.

39:26.082 --> 39:27.699
What if a group of people

39:27.734 --> 39:29.667
were going to converge on a spot,

39:29.702 --> 39:32.533
and they used a GPS to send the signal?

39:39.127 --> 39:40.415
Here's one that isn't receiving.

39:40.450 --> 39:42.377
That's because it's sending, isn't it?

39:42.412 --> 39:44.452
What are those coordinates, please?

40:42.881 --> 40:43.557
Damn.

40:47.175 --> 40:48.462
You got to be kidding me.

41:18.721 --> 41:19.832
They almost made it.

41:19.867 --> 41:21.610
79 gold bars accounted for.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.354
And three business partners.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.100
I guess you kill people when
they lose their value, huh?

41:28.135 --> 41:29.795
Law of the jungle, boss.

41:30.926 --> 41:32.273
That's going to come in handy

41:32.583 --> 41:33.960
where you're going.

41:51.897 --> 41:52.857
Did you find him?

41:52.892 --> 41:54.576
As a matter of fact, I did.

41:54.611 --> 41:56.648
Did you know he was
planning to kill you?

41:56.683 --> 41:58.011
No, he's not like that.

41:58.046 --> 41:59.066
I saw the bodies.

42:01.276 --> 42:02.858
I know there's an explanation.

42:02.893 --> 42:04.989
You don't know him.
Under it all, he's...

42:05.024 --> 42:06.693
He's a very decent guy, right?

42:06.728 --> 42:10.168
Well, a decent guy wouldn't have exploited
this tragedy in the way that he has,

42:10.203 --> 42:11.125
and Florida

42:11.160 --> 42:12.886
has had enough, frankly.

42:25.575 --> 42:26.385
You okay?

42:29.445 --> 42:30.758
Better get to booking.

42:45.362 --> 42:46.044
Ma'am.

42:47.208 --> 42:48.138
Sir.

42:48.797 --> 42:49.998
Heard you got Riddick,

42:50.033 --> 42:51.019
and the gold.

42:51.054 --> 42:53.383
Yes. Paperwork by the end of the week.

42:53.418 --> 42:55.704
I already shopped a judge.
Throw the key away on this guy.

42:58.890 --> 43:01.411
I was worried you were going
to cancel dinner tonight.

43:01.638 --> 43:03.831
That would not be possible.

43:06.882 --> 43:07.680
But?

43:07.715 --> 43:09.449
I've got to push it back an hour.

43:09.484 --> 43:10.330
Drinks with someone?

43:10.365 --> 43:10.989
No.

43:10.990 --> 43:13.068
There's a victim in the hospital,

43:13.103 --> 43:14.758
and I have to go see him and his wife,

43:14.793 --> 43:16.340
so, about an hour.

43:16.825 --> 43:18.609
Okay, 9:00 then, my place.

43:18.989 --> 43:20.447
I'll leave the door unlocked.

43:21.303 --> 43:22.229
See you.

43:22.704 --> 43:24.088
Yes, you will.
