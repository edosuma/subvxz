WEBVTT

00:00.766 --> 00:02.333
This is so weird.

00:02.367 --> 00:04.268
It's not poker night without Dave.

00:04.303 --> 00:05.937
I can't believe he's gone.

00:05.971 --> 00:09.807
I know. I just saw him last
week and he looked so happy.

00:09.841 --> 00:11.475
Life's fragile, man.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.577
One day you're walking around
without a care in the world

00:13.612 --> 00:15.313
and then suddenly, poof, it's over.

00:16.615 --> 00:18.115
When is Dave's wedding anyways?

00:20.386 --> 00:23.621
You know, I was going to
take Emma for the night,

00:23.656 --> 00:26.024
but how about I take
the three of you instead?

00:26.058 --> 00:27.559
Why don't I sit in?

00:27.593 --> 00:30.828
If by "sit in" you mean make
me a sandwich, I'll take ham.

00:33.265 --> 00:36.000
Come on! Why can't I play?

00:36.035 --> 00:38.257
This is like your dad's
game all over again.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.805
I always wanted to play
but they would never let me.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.907
Of course, now I know why.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.176
Talk about a table full
of queens and no straights.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.748
Or maybe it's because
you don't know how to play.

00:49.782 --> 00:50.921
Oh really?

00:50.923 --> 00:54.914
Maybe you're forgetting all those times I left
you in your stroller at the Indian Casino!

00:56.956 --> 01:00.959
Besides, we do family game night together
every month. Why can't we add poker?

01:00.993 --> 01:03.462
Oh, hell no!

01:03.496 --> 01:05.726
My chips, my cards, my rules.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.700
And rule number one is no boobs allowed.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.536
You know, other than these two.

01:12.111 --> 01:13.445
Oh, we'll see about that.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.542
- Will we?
- Oh, we will!

01:16.576 --> 01:18.911
Yeah, that's right. You better run.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.648
I'm right behind you!

01:22.683 --> 01:25.051
- Should we help him?
- Nah.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.155
- Wanna see if the game's on?
- Yeah.

Baby Daddy - 04x17 Wheeler War

<font color="#80ff80">sync and correction by solfieri
www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:43.404 --> 01:45.872
Oh. Ben. Hi. Hey. Hi.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.740
Hey Riles. Mr. Perrin.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.144
Ben, this is Ross.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.979
Remember? My boss.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.781
Oh my god. My bad.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.216
I just looked up and I thought
I saw your dad for a minute.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.086
How's it going, Ross?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.456
Ironically, you're the only dad here.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.195
Well, I guess I should get
going. See you tonight?

02:09.229 --> 02:12.999
Oh, you know what, I'm sorry.
I can't. I have this thing.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.002
"This thing?" You mean family game night?

02:16.036 --> 02:18.204
Game night? I like the sound of that.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.806
Oh, dude, it's awesome.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.476
We get together once a month and play
games until someone cries or passes out.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.878
Then somebody wakes up at a
bus depot in a wheelbarrow.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.949
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.152
It sounds fun. Can outsiders join?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.557
Sure, yeah. Of course.
The more the merrier.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.026
Fantastic. Then I'll see you both later.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.462
- Yay.
- All right? Later.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.034
Oh my god, Ben. What is wrong with you?

02:48.068 --> 02:51.003
What are you talking about? You'd think
you'd be happy. I'm making an effort.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.639
Uh, yeah, making an effort to annoy me.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.208
Hey, I didn't say what kind of effort.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.878
Are you trying to keep
Ross away from us or something?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.048
Yes. That is exactly what
I am trying to do.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.450
Ben, please. I really like this guy,

03:04.485 --> 03:07.086
but something happens
to sweet, innocent men

03:07.121 --> 03:08.821
when they hang out with you people.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.859
Riley, calm down. I think
you're overreacting a little.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.594
It's not like we're
a bunch of neanderthals.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.235
Stop it. Oh, come on!

03:25.707 --> 03:30.577
So, Danny, I don't want to sway your
opinion but what do you think of this Ross guy?

03:30.612 --> 03:33.734
You know, other than he's totally not right
for Riley on any level whatsoever.

03:34.816 --> 03:37.484
What do you care? You're not
still interested, are you?

03:37.519 --> 03:40.454
I don't know, man. I guess I just hated
how it ended.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.922
I think I pretty much drove her away.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.924
I just couldn't let go of the thought
that she was in love with you.

03:43.958 --> 03:44.992
And you were in love with her.

03:45.026 --> 03:46.742
Riley in love with me?

03:46.895 --> 03:51.131
Me in love with Riley?
Wow... that's you know, wow.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.268
I'm pretty sure that's why
she finally broke up with me.

03:56.371 --> 03:57.838
Dude, are you okay?

03:57.872 --> 04:00.741
Yeah, I'm fine. Wait...

04:00.775 --> 04:03.677
She broke up with you?
I thought you broke up with her.

04:04.079 --> 04:07.081
Not that I care. Who cares? I know I don't.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.518
I had this completely insane thought that
she was going to go running into your arms.

04:10.552 --> 04:12.987
But she ran right past you into Ross',

04:13.021 --> 04:15.123
and you've been dating
half of Manhattan so...

04:15.157 --> 04:18.192
Once again, well done, Ben.
Wrong on all accounts.

04:18.226 --> 04:22.330
I just wish Ross would go away so I could see
if there was still something there. You know?

04:22.364 --> 04:25.400
I might be wrong but
she seems pretty happy with him,

04:25.434 --> 04:27.001
and he's pretty different from you.

04:28.637 --> 04:31.473
Oh my god, Danny, you're a genius.

04:31.507 --> 04:33.908
What better way to get rid of somebody
than to make them more like me.

04:34.911 --> 04:37.879
But didn't she just break up
with the me that is you?

04:37.914 --> 04:40.782
Dude, you're over-thinking it,
okay? This is going to be great.

04:40.817 --> 04:44.119
Especially now that I know the two of you
have no feelings for each other whatsoever.

04:46.622 --> 04:48.290
Dude, what's the matter with you?

04:51.394 --> 04:55.797
One hand. If I win, you let
me in the poker game.

04:55.832 --> 04:59.179
If you win, I leave and
never mention it again.

04:59.369 --> 05:01.070
You had me at "you leave."

05:02.672 --> 05:04.373
All right, I'll take two.

05:06.810 --> 05:08.010
I'm good.

05:09.512 --> 05:13.115
Three of a kind. Read 'em and weep.

05:13.149 --> 05:15.684
And by weep I mean get the hell out.

05:15.719 --> 05:19.221
Ooh, have you met the king and his family?

05:19.255 --> 05:22.057
Royal flush, baby!

05:23.259 --> 05:25.627
No luck for the tuck tuck.

05:25.662 --> 05:29.231
I will see you at the next
poker night, Lieutenant Loser.

05:33.170 --> 05:38.170
My dry cleaner has a
serious gambling problem.

05:48.386 --> 05:50.820
Knock, knock. Ross?

05:50.855 --> 05:53.490
Oh, hey, Riley. Just playing
a little poker with the guys.

05:53.524 --> 05:56.459
Hey, look at this, my two
ladies just beat these three ladies.

05:59.397 --> 06:00.730
Hey, hey, Ross?

06:00.765 --> 06:04.601
I can't reach something on the top shelf in
the kitchen cabinet.

06:04.635 --> 06:07.370
I'm not sure what I need
so can you just take it down?

06:08.873 --> 06:10.741
I'll be right back, guys.

06:10.775 --> 06:13.177
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

06:15.513 --> 06:19.383
Thanks, honey,
you're the greatest. Okay, hurry back.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.318
Oh my god. What the hell are you doing?

06:22.420 --> 06:25.155
I said that I didn't want you
hanging out together and, uh,

06:25.190 --> 06:27.157
this is the opposite of that.

06:27.192 --> 06:30.594
Hey, if Ross wants to hang out with us, maybe
he's not the guy you think he is.

06:31.997 --> 06:33.564
Hey, what's going on?

06:33.598 --> 06:35.766
Ooh, are we voting a
member out of the group?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.536
I vote Tucker. No, Riley.
No, Tucker. Oh man, this is so hard.

06:40.239 --> 06:43.307
No, they are hijacking my
relationship with Ross.

06:43.342 --> 06:45.610
Oh, I like him.

06:45.644 --> 06:48.045
He's a lot better than
the last guy you dated.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.580
That was me, mom.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.851
Again, I really like Ross.

06:55.287 --> 06:56.654
They let him play poker.

06:57.789 --> 07:00.391
You let that newbie play and not me?

07:00.425 --> 07:02.527
Oh, dimples gots to go!

07:03.896 --> 07:06.831
You know what, for once,
I agree with Mrs. Wheeler.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.834
And it pains me, deeply, to say that.

07:11.637 --> 07:13.972
Sorry, but I'm not
going to dis-invite my new friend.

07:14.006 --> 07:15.940
Uh-uh. No way. Not happening.

07:15.975 --> 07:19.164
You know what, I think it is.
And you want to know why?

07:19.212 --> 07:22.514
Because I am going to play you for him.

07:22.548 --> 07:24.182
- Play me for him. How are we...
- One...

07:24.217 --> 07:26.351
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Two...

07:26.385 --> 07:28.253
-Three, four...
-Riley, think about what you're saying!

07:28.287 --> 07:30.355
I declare a Wheeler War!

07:38.031 --> 07:39.965
Is that bad? 'Cause it sounds bad.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.400
Yo mama is on the floor.

07:49.119 --> 07:51.119
Wait. I'm a little confused.

07:51.121 --> 07:52.655
I'm sorry, a Wheeler what?

07:52.689 --> 07:53.956
Hey, man, don't ask.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.925
If we stay silent and don't
make eye contact

07:55.959 --> 07:58.027
maybe they won't realize we're here.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.835
You, my friend, are about to participate
in a very rare sporting event.

08:05.869 --> 08:07.303
A Wheeler War.

08:07.337 --> 08:10.706
Called on a not-so-very-regular
basis to decide important life decisions.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.609
We've used it to settle
all family disputes.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.745
I only lost once.

08:15.779 --> 08:17.647
God, I really only wanted one kid.

08:20.885 --> 08:24.621
I actually wanted a
little sister. We kinda both lost that year.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.359
Well, what dispute are you
settling this time?

08:30.995 --> 08:32.861
- It's...
- Ah...

08:32.897 --> 08:35.432
Well I'll tell you what I'm playing for.

08:35.466 --> 08:38.201
Bonnie's right to join poker night.

08:38.235 --> 08:39.903
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.905
Wait, what? We are?
Oh, now I give a crap. You're going down.

08:44.876 --> 08:49.876
Um, not really sure this is the important
life decision you think it is but, okay.

08:50.648 --> 08:54.718
Now that a Wheeler War has been
decreed, first things first.

08:54.752 --> 08:56.486
We choose team captains.

08:56.521 --> 08:58.288
- Okay. How do we do that?
- I call captain.

08:58.323 --> 09:00.357
Like that.

09:00.391 --> 09:01.458
I pick Ross.

09:01.492 --> 09:03.527
Ah, okay! Well, I pick Danny.

09:03.561 --> 09:04.795
Uh, Tucker.

09:04.829 --> 09:07.464
Ugh, god, this is so hard.

09:11.369 --> 09:13.170
Damn it.

09:17.442 --> 09:19.510
I'm the only one left.

09:22.381 --> 09:24.448
Okay, fine. I'll take Mrs. Wheeler.

09:25.617 --> 09:27.985
So, it looks like it's team...

09:28.020 --> 09:31.289
Bucker-Ross vs. Team Bo-Riny.

09:33.425 --> 09:36.761
Wait, are we gonna get t-shirts
with that name on it?

09:36.795 --> 09:38.396
Because I won't wear that.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.603
Dude, this is gonna work out perfect.

09:45.637 --> 09:48.039
Riley calls for the Wheeler
war and we get rid of Ross.

09:48.073 --> 09:50.842
And you know as well as I do, that's
one couple that isn't meant to be together.

09:51.344 --> 09:54.913
I'm just moving the process along. But will
I get thanked? Probably not.

09:56.616 --> 10:00.685
Ben, just because you get rid of Ross doesn't
mean that Riley is going to run back to you.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.422
I mean, what if she wants
to be with someone else?

10:03.456 --> 10:05.190
And what if someone else
wants to be with her?

10:06.626 --> 10:08.493
I think you should just
let nature take it's course.

10:09.562 --> 10:11.763
Screw nature.

10:11.798 --> 10:13.932
You're gonna throw the first game for me.

10:13.967 --> 10:16.201
- Is that a threat?
- No, it's a plea.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.170
I really need this.

10:18.204 --> 10:20.372
Don't you want to see
me and Riley back together?

10:22.909 --> 10:24.743
Yes, so much.

10:31.017 --> 10:34.586
This is going to be great. I was actually
quite the athlete back in college.

10:34.621 --> 10:36.555
Really?

10:36.589 --> 10:39.958
What? We've talked about this.
Golf is a sport.

10:41.228 --> 10:43.362
If you say so, honey.

10:43.396 --> 10:45.698
But, actually, I was hoping...

10:45.732 --> 10:49.118
That maybe you could throw
the first game for me?

10:50.137 --> 10:53.706
Wow, you must really
want Bonnie to play poker.

10:53.741 --> 10:55.808
I really, really do.

10:55.843 --> 10:58.244
It would just, it would mean a lot to me.

11:02.817 --> 11:04.984
Then it looks like I'm
losing the first game.

11:07.121 --> 11:09.923
How serious do these games get anyway?

11:09.957 --> 11:14.194
Well, let's just say that someone's pinky
once had to be surgically reattached.

11:15.229 --> 11:17.330
But I think it looks pretty good, right?

11:19.834 --> 11:21.434
- Come on, Ross!
- Come on, Danny!

11:21.469 --> 11:23.103
Let's go, buddy! Yeah!

11:23.137 --> 11:26.640
Oh my god, what is wrong
with Danny? How could Ross be in the lead?

11:26.674 --> 11:28.642
Hey, come on! Danny would never cheat.

11:30.311 --> 11:32.979
-Wait, you weren't saying that were you?
-No.

11:33.014 --> 11:34.414
Here they come, let's go!

11:36.184 --> 11:38.218
Ooh, I think I hear them!

11:38.252 --> 11:40.854
Yes! Come on, Ross! Let's go, baby!

11:40.888 --> 11:43.156
How can we be losing?

11:43.191 --> 11:44.992
- Leg cramp!
- Oh, yes!

11:45.026 --> 11:46.760
What?

11:46.762 --> 11:48.282
Yes! Yes!

11:48.363 --> 11:49.730
Ross, what the hell happened to you?

11:49.764 --> 11:52.299
I'm really sorry, man. Old golf injury.

11:52.334 --> 11:54.134
Golf's not a sport!

11:57.439 --> 12:00.141
Oh, never mind me, you know.
I'll just heal out here.

12:01.977 --> 12:03.711
What the hell? You were
supposed to throw the game.

12:03.745 --> 12:06.899
I tried. I stopped to tie my shoes twice.

12:06.901 --> 12:08.712
Fine. Then you're going to
have to throw the next one.

12:08.714 --> 12:10.047
That's not the deal.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.256
Don't you want to win Riley's
heart fair and square? I know I do... would.

12:16.258 --> 12:18.526
If I was in your position, hypothetically.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.547
Besides, I can't just lose.
It's against the professional athlete oath.

12:22.631 --> 12:24.399
- What's that?
- Don't lose.

12:25.401 --> 12:29.203
Okay, that is ten points for team Bo-Riny.

12:29.238 --> 12:33.641
Putting us solidly ahead
of the losers, team Bucker-Ross.

12:34.777 --> 12:36.678
All right, what game's next?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.580
Mistress of ceremonies?

12:38.614 --> 12:40.682
All right, Emma, please pick.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.550
- Oh!
- Ah-ha.

12:44.653 --> 12:47.430
Yes! It's the Wheelay Wace.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.758
Danny named it when he was nine.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.693
Soon after he started speech therapy.

12:52.695 --> 12:54.162
Uh-oh.

12:54.197 --> 12:55.730
Yeah, uh-oh is right.

12:55.765 --> 12:59.668
Because Danny and I have
never lost a Wheelay Wace in our wives.

13:00.870 --> 13:03.505
Well, there's a first time for everything.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.922
Wow, you really don't want
your mom playing poker.

13:06.075 --> 13:08.210
Oh, I don't.

13:08.244 --> 13:10.145
Oh, I do.

13:11.347 --> 13:14.016
Well, I'm just glad I'm not
in the middle of this.

13:19.284 --> 13:21.284
Come on, Mrs. Wheeler!

13:21.286 --> 13:24.222
G... F... E...

13:24.256 --> 13:26.958
G... F... D... C...

13:26.992 --> 13:29.660
No, you missed a letter.
Back to the roof and start over.

13:29.695 --> 13:30.695
Damn it!

13:30.729 --> 13:31.829
A!

13:31.864 --> 13:33.631
All right, now you just need
to stack it and rap it.

13:33.665 --> 13:35.399
Go, go, go!

13:35.434 --> 13:36.901
Danny, get your helmet on!

13:36.935 --> 13:39.270
Okay, oh my god.
I think we might actually win this round.

13:39.304 --> 13:41.706
Which is good, right?
Because I assume you want to keep Ross.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.107
Because you guys are great, right?

13:43.141 --> 13:44.509
Oh my god, so great.

13:44.543 --> 13:46.811
And you're still dating Ashley, right?
You guys are doing great?

13:46.845 --> 13:49.080
So great! Maybe we should
double date sometime?

13:49.114 --> 13:51.782
Oh my god, how much fun would that be?

13:51.817 --> 13:53.383
N... M... L...

13:53.385 --> 13:55.086
Come on, Mrs. Wheeler.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.388
If I drank all this beer
then I'd probably be wasted.

13:57.423 --> 14:00.091
Gonna stack it so high
even god'll taste it.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.292
Done!

14:01.327 --> 14:03.745
F... E... D...

14:03.929 --> 14:05.697
Wait, what happened to the Baton?

14:05.731 --> 14:07.132
I got hungry. Just go!

14:08.801 --> 14:12.771
One. Two. Three!

14:14.573 --> 14:16.141
Yeah!

14:16.175 --> 14:19.677
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

14:19.712 --> 14:21.346
Oh, this ain't the whole party.

14:23.983 --> 14:26.551
Sorry.

14:26.581 --> 14:29.112
I get a little carried away sometimes.

14:29.255 --> 14:31.189
If that was a little,
I'd hate to see a lot.

14:33.059 --> 14:36.662
Yo, maybe I don't have
to win to get rid of him.

14:36.696 --> 14:39.932
Maybe if Ross sees the real
Riley, he'll get rid of her on his own.

14:41.201 --> 14:43.569
Wait, hold up.
You're not talking about unleashing

14:43.571 --> 14:47.190
Riley's ugly alter ego, Rigantor, are you?

14:47.274 --> 14:50.242
Deep down, there is no one
more competitive than Riley.

14:50.277 --> 14:52.011
She tries to keep it under control,
but you know what?

14:52.045 --> 14:54.464
I think we owe it to Ross to show him what's
really inside that...

14:54.548 --> 14:58.584
Super cute exterior with those
beautiful eyes and that kicky haircut.

15:03.824 --> 15:06.659
You really aren't over her, are you?

15:06.694 --> 15:08.194
Not even close.

15:14.301 --> 15:16.636
Nice. Picks up sweat and tears.

15:18.639 --> 15:22.175
After four rounds we are tied, 20-20.

15:22.209 --> 15:25.078
The last competition will
determine the Victor.

15:25.112 --> 15:29.249
Emma will once again draw from the
bucket for the Tie-Breaking Challenge.

15:29.283 --> 15:32.452
Oh, oh my god. She picked one.
All by herself.

15:32.486 --> 15:34.287
All right, what is it?

15:34.322 --> 15:37.924
Okay, well, here's an event that
hasn't been seen in a while.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.097
A Riley specialty, I believe.

15:40.194 --> 15:43.597
I'd like to announce the
return of the Great Skate!

15:43.631 --> 15:45.399
- Oh, no!
- Sweet cherry pie!

15:46.968 --> 15:48.802
I thought we banned that game.

15:49.537 --> 15:52.506
Danny, Danny, you have to do it.
I mean, you skate for a living.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.342
How many times do I have to say this?

15:55.376 --> 15:58.879
Ice skating and roller blading
are two completely different ideologies!

15:59.881 --> 16:01.148
What's the great skate?

16:02.017 --> 16:06.219
It's this game that takes me back to when I
used to play a lot of street hockey.

16:06.221 --> 16:08.065
You know, like most girls did.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.368
And, I don't know, I just...
I get a little competitive.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.186
A little? You flipped a Volkswagen.

16:14.363 --> 16:16.264
There was a family in it.

16:18.734 --> 16:21.903
You know, Riley, Tucker
is a champion Roller Dancer.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.806
Three time all-state.

16:24.840 --> 16:29.061
I even have a signature move named after me.
The Tuck and Duck.

16:29.511 --> 16:33.982
You have to do it, Riley. You're a grown
woman now. You can keep it in check.

16:34.016 --> 16:37.085
Okay, fine.
I guess one more time wouldn't hurt.

16:37.119 --> 16:39.120
- Yes!
- Yes!

16:40.122 --> 16:43.691
I was actually only two time all-state.
I don't know why I lied.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.899
Okay, Tucker. You remember the course.
Just keep your head down.

16:50.933 --> 16:52.433
Yeah.

16:52.468 --> 16:55.503
Hey, if I don't make it, just get to
my nightstand before my parents do.

16:57.340 --> 16:58.873
All right, now, stay off the main streets,

16:58.908 --> 17:01.509
and remember to cut through bleecker.
All right?

17:01.544 --> 17:03.445
God, it's been so long
since I've had skates on.

17:03.479 --> 17:04.980
I'm not sure I even remember how.

17:05.013 --> 17:07.482
But I'll give it my best shot.

17:07.516 --> 17:10.752
All right, skaters, to your marks.

17:10.786 --> 17:13.763
Now you be careful. You don't have as much
padding as you used to.

17:14.056 --> 17:16.825
And you know the rules. There are none.

17:16.858 --> 17:19.060
May the best team win.

17:19.095 --> 17:20.796
You don't stand a chance.

17:25.401 --> 17:28.470
Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

17:28.503 --> 17:30.939
You suck!

17:30.973 --> 17:32.541
Yeah!

17:39.649 --> 17:42.384
<i>Okay, all right. Riley-Riley, just take</i>
<i>one from the bottom</i>

17:42.418 --> 17:43.585
<i>and put it on the top.</i>

17:43.620 --> 17:45.120
<i>Okay, come on!</i>

17:45.154 --> 17:46.922
I can't believe you shut down the elevator.

17:46.956 --> 17:48.264
You are pushing me to the brink, Perrin.

17:48.391 --> 17:50.326
No, I'm pushing you out the door.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.095
No, not my tower!

17:53.129 --> 17:54.997
That's a 20 second penalty.

17:55.031 --> 17:56.632
You'll never beat me dobbs!

17:56.666 --> 17:58.500
Oh, I'm pretty sure I just did.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.637
<i>15, 14, 13...</i>

18:01.671 --> 18:03.305
<i>12... 11...</i>

18:03.340 --> 18:05.541
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i> <i>six, five,
four, three,</i> <i>two, one.</i>

18:05.575 --> 18:07.610
<i>Go, Riley, go! Yeah!</i>

18:10.180 --> 18:13.082
Oh, here they come. Yes! Riley caught up!

18:13.116 --> 18:16.519
- Oh my god!
- Where's my goal? Where's my goal?

18:16.553 --> 18:18.688
Oh, honey, you look so cute.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.190
- Ow!
- Yes!

18:21.225 --> 18:24.160
Hit the deck or die, boss man!

18:24.194 --> 18:25.828
- Ow!
- Yes!

18:25.863 --> 18:27.797
Yes! We've unleashed the beast!

18:27.831 --> 18:29.732
All right, come on, Riley.
Come on, come on, come on.

18:29.766 --> 18:31.067
Yes...

18:32.669 --> 18:34.991
Yes! I did it! I won!

18:35.005 --> 18:38.308
It was me! It was all me!

18:39.610 --> 18:42.378
Yes!

18:44.848 --> 18:45.982
Yes!

18:46.016 --> 18:47.283
Oh my god...

18:47.318 --> 18:49.352
I know. You wouldn't think
that amount of ugly

18:49.386 --> 18:51.154
could come out of that amount of pretty.

18:51.188 --> 18:53.122
But don't worry,
better men than you have fled.

18:53.157 --> 18:55.925
So, no one will blame you.
Nice meeting you, buddy.

18:57.728 --> 19:00.230
That was amazing.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.500
I don't think I've ever
been more attracted to you.

19:03.534 --> 19:04.701
Wait, what?

19:05.903 --> 19:07.904
I haven't had this much fun since college.

19:07.939 --> 19:11.241
Well, sorry you lost, honey, but...

19:11.275 --> 19:13.176
I think I know how to make it up to you.

19:13.211 --> 19:15.378
Just let me take off my skates.

19:15.413 --> 19:18.181
Oh, no, no. Leave the skates on.

19:23.554 --> 19:25.222
Well, I hope you're happy.

19:25.256 --> 19:27.390
The girl of my dreams just
skated away with another man.

19:27.425 --> 19:28.825
What am I supposed to do now?

19:28.860 --> 19:30.660
I think it's time to move on, bro.

19:30.695 --> 19:33.163
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.532
If you love something, set it free.

19:35.566 --> 19:37.000
Something about footprints.

19:38.436 --> 19:40.837
Just pick one and go with it.

19:40.872 --> 19:42.205
Well, the good news is

19:42.240 --> 19:45.858
this is the first Wheeler
War that didn't end in the emergency room.

19:49.714 --> 19:51.481
I'll call 911.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.925
No, he's a Roller Dancer. He'll be fine.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.710
Sorry, boys.

20:01.712 --> 20:04.249
You might make, like, laundry
and food.

20:05.995 --> 20:07.162
Two pair.

20:07.204 --> 20:08.571
Three of a kind.

20:08.605 --> 20:10.039
Straight flush.

20:11.175 --> 20:12.875
I got nothing.

20:14.044 --> 20:15.745
I was bluffing.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.947
And now I'm bored. This was fun.

20:17.981 --> 20:20.650
Oh, wait, mom. You forgot to pay up.

20:20.684 --> 20:22.118
Wait.

20:22.152 --> 20:24.132
You guys play this for actual money?

20:25.789 --> 20:28.139
Jeez, lady, put some clothes on.

20:33.697 --> 20:37.500
You know, I don't think that
E.R. doctor knows what he's talking about.

20:37.534 --> 20:39.343
I feel fine.
