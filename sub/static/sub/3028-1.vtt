03:29.878 --> 03:33.678

04:35.901 --> 04:36.401
Huh?

04:36.961 --> 04:37.847
In bible,

04:39.047 --> 04:40.757
Then when lust hath conceived,

04:40.957 --> 04:41.757
it bringeth forth sin: and sin,

04:42.786 --> 04:43.886

Yea Seung?

05:15.536 --> 05:17.195

05:25.653 --> 05:29.394
It feels awkward to sit here,

05:29.671 --> 05:30.680
Do you also feel like that?

05:31.827 --> 05:34.362
I did nothing wrong, why am I so nervous?

all of you changed nothing

06:02.072 --> 06:02.972
from now on,

06:03.572 --> 06:06.074
Judicial Research and
Training Institute 21th,

06:07.074 --> 06:10.297
let's get started with Pre-Jury System.

06:11.297 --> 06:12.873
Prosecutor, defend the case.

06:16.373 --> 06:20.089
The undertrial, Lee Dong Gu,
kidnapped young Choi Ji yoeng,

06:20.389 --> 06:22.143
molested, smashed her with stone and

06:22.361 --> 06:23.221
cruelly killed her.

06:24.321 --> 06:26.747
This is already proven by
National Forensic Service.

06:27.547 --> 06:28.400
This trial,

06:28.900 --> 06:31.400
there is no necessity
continuing this trial in any parts.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.101
I rest my case.

06:35.901 --> 06:37.225
Lawyer, defend.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.883
The obvious proof that he's talking
about, confirmed testimonies.

06:46.983 --> 06:47.683
These are

06:48.846 --> 06:50.477
the mistake of this trial.

06:50.877 --> 06:51.377
Your honor,

06:51.877 --> 06:54.201
- The lawyer is in contempt of Court..
- Mistake?

06:54.935 --> 06:55.435
Yes

06:56.535 --> 06:58.549
the prosecutor on this case

06:58.849 --> 07:00.699
isn't the guy who had
been assigned to this case.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.599
This case, unlike other cases,

07:04.289 --> 07:06.789
he must look back the
evidences and situations on the day

07:08.195 --> 07:11.056
but he's defending based on trumped-up
litigation records and fraudulent data

07:12.156 --> 07:14.172
which is made by
detectives long time ago.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.410
Oh, so the lawyer,

07:20.410 --> 07:21.594
are you the lawyer

07:21.894 --> 07:22.975
who had been assigned to this case?

07:25.575 --> 07:26.075
Are you?

07:29.809 --> 07:30.309
No

07:33.336 --> 07:33.836
I rest my case.

07:35.113 --> 07:35.613
But

07:38.303 --> 07:39.306
I am sure that

07:41.906 --> 07:43.740
I was there.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.871
You were there?

07:49.671 --> 07:50.171
Yes

07:51.306 --> 07:52.078
there..

07:53.278 --> 07:54.107
I was there.

07:55.707 --> 07:56.837
Your honor,

07:57.937 --> 07:59.498
statement I will be speaking from now,

08:00.598 --> 08:01.098
is definitely

08:02.404 --> 08:03.197
true.

08:06.671 --> 08:09.685
Where I can meet you?

08:10.625 --> 08:13.116
It couldn't be a fate.

08:13.683 --> 08:16.483
Miracle sailor moon

01:01:27.448 --> 01:01:27.948
Move away

01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:35.291
I didn't bring Yea Seong for you.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:36.777
Get out

01:01:44.338 --> 01:01:44.838

You read it for me please

01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:08.791

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:13.183

finally we are gonna see him reading.

01:02:13.436 --> 01:02:16.750
Yeah, I never saw him

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.868
reading a book for 7 years

01:02:19.422 --> 01:02:20.222

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.660
Let me see..

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.934
There's a butterfly
you see? Right?

01:02:28.138 --> 01:02:31.129
A butterfly was on my thigh
it was drawn on... before

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.080
oh there's only one butterfly, right?

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:38.232

Brother, there's no illiterate guy
in this generation, not in 2013.

01:02:55.881 --> 01:02:58.042
- There is no man who can't read.
- I know, go ahead!

01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:03.887
Even a dog, monkey, dolphin, orangutan and chimpanzee
can graduate from highschool after 3 months studying

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.408
I know, who said they can't!?

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.090
Illiterate? Is that a human?

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.173
Do you know how many
percentage is illiterate!?

01:03:13.761 --> 01:03:15.661
There is no illiterate one
here in the room, brother.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.100
When you say something,
know the facts first.

01:03:18.348 --> 01:03:20.545
- Okay, okay
- Where the hell is a guy who doesn't know how to read!?

01:03:20.545 --> 01:03:21.618
That's fucking idiot!

01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:24.663
I see! Don't be upset, it's your turn now.

01:03:27.343 --> 01:03:29.549

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:35.556

Is it the care of a day nursery here!?
You dumb

01:03:53.637 --> 01:03:55.657

01:03:56.672 --> 01:03:58.472
you must be going crazy

01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:00.081
Look, look at this.

01:04:00.081 --> 01:04:02.581
21 weeks, after 21 weeks, she will be out

01:04:03.015 --> 01:04:05.315
Look, read this you son
of a bitch, I won't read.

01:04:10.044 --> 01:04:13.030
You don't know how to read, how to
deal with a baby you know nothing.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.842
You fucking assholes.

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:19.898
- Why...

01:04:27.503 --> 01:04:28.203
Then..

01:04:29.405 --> 01:04:30.205
You also get a death sentence too

01:04:42.694 --> 01:04:45.645
of course, I do remember
don't even mention about the day

01:04:46.397 --> 01:04:47.997
emergency alert from the dawn.

01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:51.454
It wasn't just a daughter of police,
It was the daughter of Commissioner!

01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:55.669
Secretary of Interior even
ordered to close the case in a week!

01:04:56.162 --> 01:04:57.462
- Detective Park
- Brother!

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.206
Can I see the case of Lee Yong Goo?

01:05:04.394 --> 01:05:05.294
No, brother..

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:07.583
Let me see

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:12.150
I am a policeman of the public, brother!

01:05:21.989 --> 01:05:24.098
Are you sure this is the
statement by Lee Yong Goo!?

01:05:25.344 --> 01:05:27.144
I don't know, I'm not the guy who got it

01:05:29.475 --> 01:05:30.475
I need a copy of this

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:34.262

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:39.123

- Brother, please!

01:05:40.008 --> 01:05:40.808
I said no..

01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:42.894
You wanna see me getting fired!?

01:05:46.133 --> 01:05:48.633
You are doing this again really!?

01:05:50.307 --> 01:05:53.028
Because of that son of a bitches,
Jin Wook got kidnapped and murdered! Huh!?

01:05:56.558 --> 01:05:58.958
Wow! It's much smaller
than my telephone in my house!

01:05:59.693 --> 01:06:01.867
- Is that real?
- Of course, It's fake.

01:06:02.035 --> 01:06:02.535
It's real one!

01:06:03.535 --> 01:06:04.730

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.558
Don't press "send"

01:06:11.947 --> 01:06:12.947

01:06:25.696 --> 01:06:28.032

01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:08.994

- Yes!!
- Correct!

01:07:50.043 --> 01:07:50.843
You son of a bitch

01:07:56.794 --> 01:07:58.694
you can even study highschool stuff now.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.700
If I just knew how to read,
I would be a prosecutor.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:07.140
Don't you think they took the letter huh?

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:10.352
He's right

01:08:10.752 --> 01:08:15.412
Women can't move easily when they are pregnant.
You think she has enough energy to write a letter?

01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:16.986
Don't worry, It's fine

01:08:24.577 --> 01:08:25.277

I borrowed it from Young Woon.

01:08:40.861 --> 01:08:41.861
Isn't It a toy!?

01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:45.770
This isn't allowed here..but..

01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:49.511

01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:56.435

01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:12.348

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.359
I gave a birth myself

01:09:32.545 --> 01:09:34.045
stop crying, talk

01:09:36.162 --> 01:09:38.062
what the hell, It's not working again.

01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:41.645
This makes me crazy. Fuck!

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:44.669
Work, work, work.
Why the hell isn't it working?

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:48.231

Baby's crying, baby!!

01:10:06.316 --> 01:10:08.337
- Ask the baby to speak to dad.
- Dad?

01:10:09.403 --> 01:10:11.303
Baby, baby!

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:12.607

she's smiling, smile!!

01:10:18.645 --> 01:10:22.805
- He's got all fingers and toes?
- Of course, he's a sleepy-head just like you.

01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:26.559
- Yeah? Is it he or she?
- Daughter!

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:30.307
Brother, It's a daughter

01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:32.501

01:10:35.221 --> 01:10:36.021

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.824
- listen, I can't talk to you longer.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:48.203

01:10:48.572 --> 01:10:50.407

Name, name, name...

You got Bong in your name,

01:10:54.572 --> 01:10:58.046
Ah!! Bong Seon. Shin Bong Seon.

01:10:58.343 --> 01:11:01.350
Wrong, It's too wrong

01:11:01.731 --> 01:11:04.352
- I love you honey.
- I love you too, Seon yeo!

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:09.290

01:11:18.415 --> 01:11:20.542
- Is he handsome?
- Yes, he's reliable.

01:11:23.534 --> 01:11:24.980
You are also reliable to me.

01:11:29.098 --> 01:11:31.241
You are most reliable to me

01:11:31.748 --> 01:11:34.802

01:11:39.356 --> 01:11:40.230
That's good.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:41.430

She just died like that!?

01:12:43.715 --> 01:12:46.615
Even I think it over and over,
it doesn't make sense.

01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:49.173
- Lee Yong Goo.
- Yeah.

01:12:49.173 --> 01:12:51.173
How was she lying down?

01:12:53.234 --> 01:12:55.812
She was just lying down
I was scared

01:12:57.859 --> 01:12:58.359

01:12:59.259 --> 01:13:01.682
I think there's another guy
who tried to steal

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:04.631
- the bag and killed her.
- Bullshit!

01:13:09.407 --> 01:13:12.584
- When you got there, she was lying down like this?
- Yeah.

01:13:12.826 --> 01:13:14.461

- Yeah.

01:13:21.213 --> 01:13:24.514
- Do you feel dying?
- Shit, my arm arm arm

01:13:24.716 --> 01:13:26.510
- it fucking hurts.
- Right?

01:13:27.166 --> 01:13:27.666
Arm

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.565
usually when a person falls down,
they use their arm to support the body

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:35.340
but in her, her backhead got broken

01:13:36.268 --> 01:13:38.202
why backhead!?

01:13:45.929 --> 01:13:49.133
- The bag, bag! SailorMoon bag!
- Yes!!

01:13:49.962 --> 01:13:52.124
Sailor Moon bag..

01:13:56.748 --> 01:13:57.436
Like this.

01:14:04.289 --> 01:14:09.455
- Yeah, it was the bag!
- When did it happen? What's the date of it!?

01:14:10.692 --> 01:14:14.626
- Feburary 27, 1:15 lunch shift.
- Okay, okay.

01:14:14.626 --> 01:14:20.727
- Feburary 27..
- On 27th!? It's my son-in-law's marriage!

01:14:23.152 --> 01:14:25.401
- What the fuck.
- Water isn't coming out

01:14:25.401 --> 01:14:27.896
what the!! fix it!!

01:14:28.002 --> 01:14:30.535
Pipe got frozed, we weren't
able to take a shower!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:35.455
- Yeah, he's right! Temp -18!
- Yes.

01:14:36.995 --> 01:14:38.195
She slipped on ice!

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.300
Yeah! That's it!

01:14:44.099 --> 01:14:46.099
In market, there are

01:14:46.543 --> 01:14:47.640
full of ices

01:14:49.348 --> 01:14:51.648
how about the scar on her forehead?

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.265
I heard there was a brick

01:14:56.329 --> 01:14:59.089
- yeah... there was a brick.
- A brick?

01:15:01.547 --> 01:15:02.955
Yes, yes.

01:15:03.607 --> 01:15:05.714
If the girl fell down like this

01:15:17.953 --> 01:15:19.753
what a crazy...

01:15:20.253 --> 01:15:21.564
how the hell is this..

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.859
Everything is clear now
but why did you take off her pants?

01:15:27.841 --> 01:15:30.572
First, loosen the belt

01:15:31.536 --> 01:15:33.564
- helps blood circulation.
- Blood circulation!?

01:15:33.864 --> 01:15:35.656
- Yes.
- Then why did you choke her?

01:15:36.355 --> 01:15:37.455
I didn't choke her neck

01:15:38.896 --> 01:15:39.396
second,

01:15:40.696 --> 01:15:43.002
give a pressure on the chest

01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:47.671
next

01:15:48.471 --> 01:15:49.647
free airway

01:15:50.396 --> 01:15:51.350
cover one's nose

01:15:51.869 --> 01:15:52.891
12 times in a minute,

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:55.390
give the air in.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.657
Okay, you are doing great.

01:16:05.449 --> 01:16:05.949
Next?

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.379
Wake up, get up
wake up, are you okay?

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.291
- Wake up.
- Good

01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:16.009
you need to shake him
so that he can wake up

01:16:16.597 --> 01:16:17.197
so... next?

01:16:19.431 --> 01:16:21.418
Pinch or slap

01:16:23.723 --> 01:16:26.098
- sir, you don't need to slap him for real.
- He's alive now

01:16:26.402 --> 01:16:28.825
- what the..
- Yes, he's alive..alive..

01:16:30.213 --> 01:16:33.740
So... everybody, after me
repeat..

01:16:34.094 --> 01:16:36.238
CPR!

01:16:36.489 --> 01:16:40.051
- CPR?
- Yeah..that's right.

01:16:40.574 --> 01:16:43.143
CPR, It's right..right..

01:16:43.736 --> 01:16:46.385
Dead one is a daughter of the attorney general

01:16:47.245 --> 01:16:49.348
they can't afford the long time to investigate

01:16:49.348 --> 01:16:52.611
guys from up there will give a pressure a lot
guys from down wants a change to promote.

01:16:52.967 --> 01:16:55.550
Who can't see this situation, poor YongGoo
went there, got suspected of a guilt

01:16:56.777 --> 01:16:58.477
fuck, we will do help YongGoo's trial!

01:17:04.768 --> 01:17:05.663
I have an objection

01:17:06.763 --> 01:17:09.479
these witnesses are testifying
what hasn't been proven.

01:17:09.776 --> 01:17:13.703
The statements they just testified,
there are no lies in there.

01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:16.234
Is that right?

01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:22.723
- Mr. Choi Young Ho.
- Yes, sir

01:17:24.128 --> 01:17:25.080
what's your job?

01:17:29.493 --> 01:17:31.493
- Hallelujah, I'm a pastor.
- I'm talking about the past.

01:17:34.376 --> 01:17:41.388
I...I don't know when are you talking about ..
It's just like a small group, we used to play a soccer and..

01:17:41.388 --> 01:17:45.286
- You were a member of gang, right?
- Yes..

01:17:45.759 --> 01:17:48.850
- Your honor, he is asking things that aren't...
- How about Choi Chang Soo?

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:55.583
Since I was young, I had a dream about,
a treasure and a treasure chest, deep in the sea

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:58.141
oh you are with seven previous convictions!?

01:17:58.341 --> 01:17:59.076
I have objection.

01:17:59.992 --> 01:18:02.870
The presecutor is abusing the witness's past
in this trial.

01:18:03.806 --> 01:18:04.706
Rejected.

01:18:07.385 --> 01:18:12.040
Gangster and a guy who has seven previous convitions
do they have credibilities?

01:18:13.091 --> 01:18:17.763
Bro, no..I mean sir?
Do we have any law in criminal law

01:18:18.099 --> 01:18:24.034
like "don't listen and believe
whatever gangster and swindlers say?"

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.190
- None, but...
- Look.

01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:30.966
So, gangsters

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:33.884
always make bullshits?
Is there any law there like this!?

01:18:38.523 --> 01:18:39.067
None..

01:18:40.323 --> 01:18:42.522
I'm done with examination of a witness..

01:18:42.522 --> 01:18:44.196
It's not Examination! It's a questioning!

01:18:44.394 --> 01:18:45.703
Am I a student!!?

01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:51.738
- Quiet!
- Sorry sir.

01:18:53.234 --> 01:18:55.939
Lawyer, do you have any other witness?

01:18:56.339 --> 01:18:59.299
As the prosecutor wanted, I have
one who never commited a crime,

01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:03.032
but served this country with honor.

01:19:04.279 --> 01:19:06.118
I call him as a witness

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.832
in Sungnam prison, security Chief, I'm Jang Min Ha

01:19:30.716 --> 01:19:33.091
- as you know, there is a prisoner in our...
- How have you been doing?

01:19:38.511 --> 01:19:40.497
I believe that you have 3 meals in a day,

01:19:43.807 --> 01:19:45.207
you will exercise everyday,

01:19:47.107 --> 01:19:47.789
and after 9 PM,

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:51.090
you will go to bed.

01:19:54.204 --> 01:19:54.704
Sir..

01:19:56.599 --> 01:19:58.199
I can't ask you this but..

01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:00.638
I'm asking you to investigate again.

01:20:02.435 --> 01:20:03.993
While we are investigating again,

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.340
someday the prisoner will be released from the prison, right?

01:20:12.676 --> 01:20:13.176
Lee Yong Goo.

01:20:16.776 --> 01:20:17.830
He's not the criminal

01:20:23.577 --> 01:20:24.077
have you..

01:20:26.877 --> 01:20:27.877
Lost a son or daughter before?

01:20:35.365 --> 01:20:36.365
I have lost..

01:20:40.732 --> 01:20:41.932
By my favorite prisoner..

01:20:50.943 --> 01:20:54.435
The accused,
you kidnapped the girl Choi Ji Young

01:20:54.435 --> 01:20:57.534
to revenge on the chief of the commissioner
Is that right?

01:21:00.368 --> 01:21:02.420
Yeah... I followed.

01:21:03.207 --> 01:21:04.107
SailorMoon bag

01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:08.951
papa, just read exactly what they've wrote for you

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:10.909
- Yeah...
- Read.

01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:14.399
Ji Young said

01:21:15.599 --> 01:21:18.948
she will let me know where I can buy the sailormoon bag,

01:21:20.148 --> 01:21:21.479
so I just followed

01:21:21.879 --> 01:21:23.084
- good!
- You are doing great

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.423
have you took off the victim's pants
for sexual molestation?

01:21:27.212 --> 01:21:27.932
Have you? Or not!?

01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:32.458
Loosen the belt first to help blood circulation
- yes!

01:21:38.572 --> 01:21:41.247
I can't recall what really happened.

01:21:41.512 --> 01:21:44.271
Have you smashed her head
to kill her?

01:21:44.529 --> 01:21:47.337
No... Ji Young fell down...

01:21:49.361 --> 01:21:52.472
Look, Yong Goo. What did I say.

01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:53.833
If you can't remember what to say?

01:21:55.093 --> 01:21:55.793
I..

01:21:59.639 --> 01:22:01.667
- I don't remember..
- Yes. That's how you do it!

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.451
I don't..I don't remember

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:05.356
- Happily.
- Happily.

01:22:05.527 --> 01:22:07.429
Okay, good job!

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.135
- A brick fell on her head.
- Have you seen it happening?

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:12.249
- I haven't...
- What's wrong with you!

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.845
- Even if you haven't seen it, you should pretend!
- Then..

01:22:15.944 --> 01:22:18.158
I was doing CPR...

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.418
Hey... Yong Goo... Yong Goo!

01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:23.751
Do it in the morning, morning!

01:22:24.663 --> 01:22:25.163
Yeah...

01:22:27.874 --> 01:22:28.874
your

01:22:30.273 --> 01:22:31.173
honor,

01:22:32.021 --> 01:22:32.721
I..

01:22:34.821 --> 01:22:35.563
Am..

01:22:36.763 --> 01:22:38.398
An intellectually handicapped person

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:42.660
detectives..hit me ..

01:22:45.172 --> 01:22:46.172
Without asking..

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:49.901
- Try to read it.
- What's this all about?

01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:52.806
Famous line, so famous!
I am the one who wrote!

01:22:52.807 --> 01:22:55.246
Sign on it, sign!
Don't you get it dirty

01:22:55.701 --> 01:22:56.840
don't eat it!

01:22:59.854 --> 01:23:03.637
They said if I make a fingerprint on the paper,

01:23:05.478 --> 01:23:06.885
they will send me to YeaSeong and buy me SailorMoon bag

01:23:07.885 --> 01:23:12.217
so these statements

01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:17.541
are forged

01:23:17.641 --> 01:23:18.788
perfect! Ended the case!

01:23:18.789 --> 01:23:23.379
- Great
- Good job!

01:23:24.057 --> 01:23:25.757
Mr. Lee Yong Goo!

01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:28.691
- Yeah?
- National lawyer is here for you

01:23:30.931 --> 01:23:31.731
come on

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.580
anything you wanna eat?

01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:37.044
I can do those things..

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:39.197
"Break time."

01:23:40.652 --> 01:23:43.591
- Chocolate?
- Yeah. Delicious "break time".

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:46.810
You got a daughter, Lee Yea Seong?

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.910
Yeah, Lee Yea Seong, daughter of Lee Yong Goo
Lee Yea Seong is pretty

01:23:52.387 --> 01:23:54.687
- you listen to me.
- Yeah..

01:23:55.664 --> 01:24:00.251
The daughter's father is the chief of the commissioner
- yeah..

01:24:04.678 --> 01:24:06.181
You know polices?

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.317
Yeah... police

01:24:08.738 --> 01:24:11.909
- scary..police.
- Yeah... the head of those scary men.

01:24:12.661 --> 01:24:14.361
He's really mad now.

01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:17.448
He might do something to your daughter

01:24:19.248 --> 01:24:19.948
yeah..

01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:22.153
Fucking annoying..

01:24:24.938 --> 01:24:25.656
Lawyer

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:27.900
lawyer

01:24:30.325 --> 01:24:31.025
this is..

01:24:32.635 --> 01:24:33.835
A petition from the prisoners

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:38.114
this shit doesn't help.

01:24:42.424 --> 01:24:44.724
Even though you are a national lawyer,
isn't it too much?

01:24:46.338 --> 01:24:47.939
You think It will change with an effort?

01:24:51.522 --> 01:24:52.222
Try to look at this

01:24:53.075 --> 01:24:54.106
look at this!

01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:57.659
Lee Yong Goo isn't enough smart
to write this!

01:24:58.379 --> 01:24:59.800
You still think he's the criminal!?

01:25:20.624 --> 01:25:21.924
For Yea Seong..

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.840
Stay awake, focus..

01:25:26.611 --> 01:25:27.111
Yeah..

01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:29.811
I will go home, home..

01:25:31.174 --> 01:25:31.674
Yeah..

01:25:34.168 --> 01:25:36.368
Don't you worry, you can go home.

01:25:37.286 --> 01:25:39.186
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:25:44.894 --> 01:25:45.894
Ji Young said..

01:25:48.079 --> 01:25:49.179
She will let me know

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:53.084
where to buy Sailor Moon bag

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:17.482
- tell the prosecutor everything, okay?
- Okay..

01:26:19.072 --> 01:26:19.991
Word at a time

01:26:22.546 --> 01:26:24.868
the accused, Lee Yong Goo

01:26:25.249 --> 01:26:27.849
have you kidnapped Choi Ji Young

01:26:28.402 --> 01:26:31.937
to revenge on the chief of the commissioner who hit you?

01:26:37.286 --> 01:26:38.286
I mean

01:26:38.977 --> 01:26:41.511
have you kidnapped Choi Ji Young?

01:26:41.512 --> 01:26:46.348
You sacrifice yourself for Yea Seong
You know what I mean?

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.355
You are a father!

01:26:50.587 --> 01:26:55.299
Have you smashed her on purpose
because she resisted

01:26:56.099 --> 01:26:58.053
from the sexual molestation?

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:06.927
I am asking you again

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.905
have you smashed her head with a brick?

01:27:13.414 --> 01:27:15.239
- The accused?
- Yeah?

01:27:16.006 --> 01:27:17.606
- Answer me.
- Yeah?

01:27:20.609 --> 01:27:23.821
Be purged of sin

01:27:26.259 --> 01:27:28.218
or else

01:27:29.907 --> 01:27:31.307
I will do the same to your daughter

01:27:49.019 --> 01:27:50.019
answer me.

01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:52.582
Yeah??

01:27:57.875 --> 01:28:03.809
Is it true that you smashed Choi Ji Young
who's resisting

01:28:04.056 --> 01:28:07.156
on purpose?

01:28:14.235 --> 01:28:15.835
I..I'm asking you again.

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:19.758
Have you smashed her head with a brick?

01:28:28.279 --> 01:28:30.366
With a brick, have you smashed!?

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:35.646
- The accused!
- Yeah.

01:28:36.352 --> 01:28:40.654
- Have you smashed!?
- Yes, I have ...Yes.

01:29:09.292 --> 01:29:12.323
Yeah, I did it. It was me

01:29:14.463 --> 01:29:17.046
Lee Yong Goo! What the hell are you saying

01:29:17.838 --> 01:29:19.258
wake up!

01:29:20.107 --> 01:29:20.607
Your honor,

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:24.858
the accused is having a problem meantally, emotionally
quiet

01:29:25.358 --> 01:29:28.069
lawyer! Do something!

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:32.254
- I killed, I did.
- Lee Yong Goo, Are you crazy!?

01:29:32.882 --> 01:29:34.677
You killed no one!!

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.547
Because of me
because of me, she died

01:29:38.084 --> 01:29:39.084
I'm sorry.

01:29:40.091 --> 01:29:41.592
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for!?

01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:44.030
Nobody is saying sorry to you

01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:46.227
what the hell are you saying for!!?

01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:53.435
Yea Seong, help her
my Yea Seong..

01:29:54.491 --> 01:29:56.700
I did it, Help Yea Seong.

01:30:21.021 --> 01:30:22.452
What the heck are you doing!?

01:30:25.137 --> 01:30:25.837
You are a lawyer

01:30:27.809 --> 01:30:29.709
lawyer isn't for this!!

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.029
Detectives in that time

01:30:37.915 --> 01:30:41.803
they took only witness's statements,
they completely ignored the accused's statement

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:43.114
even if he denied it

01:30:44.014 --> 01:30:45.371
Lee Yong Goo's statement had been forged,

01:30:45.971 --> 01:30:48.890
they interrogated with violence
forced, threathened him

01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:50.666
Forged... Also

01:30:51.327 --> 01:30:53.214
the scar on Choi Ji Young's
forehead isn't the main reason.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:57.612
But the proof that the broken backhead is the
main reason why she died had been also ignored.

01:30:58.747 --> 01:31:01.170
Lee Yong Goo's statement which is submitted by prosecutor

01:31:01.841 --> 01:31:04.355
includes that he choked
her neck but

01:31:04.803 --> 01:31:07.917
autopsy result that proves
nothing was found of any pressure on her neck

01:31:07.917 --> 01:31:10.512
had also been... ignored...

01:31:10.812 --> 01:31:12.803
lawyer, last defense.

01:31:14.539 --> 01:31:15.639
Your honor,

01:31:16.742 --> 01:31:20.081
I ask for favorable arrangements
please.

01:31:22.001 --> 01:31:23.990
The prosecutor,
demand a penalty.

01:31:27.537 --> 01:31:29.637
Since the accused had admitted..

01:31:30.528 --> 01:31:31.528
We demand

01:31:32.165 --> 01:31:37.161
a death sentence
for Lee Yong Goo

01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:44.998
your honor
the investigation was focused on proving if he's guilty or not

01:31:46.327 --> 01:31:49.509
without considering all the situations he's got.
It was defintely

01:31:49.509 --> 01:31:52.047
a unreasonable investigation.

01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:55.280
They ignored a basic principle
which is presumption of innocence

01:31:56.299 --> 01:31:58.090
the fact that the accused is an intellectually handicapped person and

01:31:58.761 --> 01:32:01.161
the fact the accused loves his daughter so much,
they abused them

01:32:02.012 --> 01:32:04.460
to give up all the situations he had
for his... daughter

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.794
for the expediency of investigative authority,

01:32:08.294 --> 01:32:10.847
- He is falsely accused..
- We,

01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:13.790
the justice department,

01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.176
since the accused admitted all the crimes,

01:32:17.076 --> 01:32:20.338
we come to a definite decision

01:32:20.838 --> 01:32:21.896
that the demand of the prosecutor,

01:32:22.839 --> 01:32:25.639
a death sentence for Lee Yong Goo

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.391
the accused Lee Yong Goo

01:32:30.006 --> 01:32:31.275
is given a death sentence

01:32:39.103 --> 01:32:40.103
thank you

01:32:42.554 --> 01:32:43.554
thank you

01:32:45.448 --> 01:32:46.448
thank you

01:32:48.762 --> 01:32:50.262
I did it all wrong..I..

01:32:56.596 --> 01:32:58.864
Help Yea Seong. Yea Seong...

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:03.619
I'm sorry.

01:33:08.329 --> 01:33:09.779
That's why I, the lawyer

01:33:14.487 --> 01:33:17.605
am here to clear his name

01:33:19.895 --> 01:33:20.795
from the false charge

01:33:23.449 --> 01:33:24.956
from a sentence of death

01:33:27.176 --> 01:33:28.076
to make things ..

01:33:30.908 --> 01:33:32.119
All clear for him..

01:33:35.602 --> 01:33:38.602
The lady will also send me in piano academy

01:33:39.595 --> 01:33:41.695
yeah... Piano.

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.040
Mr's house, they even have a Piano.

01:33:45.637 --> 01:33:48.337
Dad, I will play a piano for you later

01:33:48.982 --> 01:33:51.582
Yeah... Piano is good... Piano.

01:33:53.307 --> 01:33:53.807
Dad.

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:56.695
Dad, you are not a bad guy?

01:34:02.631 --> 01:34:03.581
- Mr. Lee Yong Goo.
- Yeah.

01:34:07.248 --> 01:34:08.248
- Bye bye.
- Bye...

01:34:29.448 --> 01:34:29.948
I told you.

01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:32.281
It's good to cook in the house
unlike..

01:34:32.661 --> 01:34:35.258
Much better to buy from the restaurants
this is so annoying..

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:39.518
For Yea Seong,
It feels like It's a festive season today

01:34:39.822 --> 01:34:42.965
look, this is what Yea Seong made
dark one is better, right?

01:34:45.601 --> 01:34:46.456
You also ..

01:34:49.956 --> 01:34:52.258
Yea Seong, Yea Seong.

01:34:55.454 --> 01:34:57.554
Hi dad.

01:34:58.869 --> 01:35:00.569
Dad how are you doing?

01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:03.280
- Is it a letter from Yea Seong?
- Letter from Yea Seong..

01:35:07.602 --> 01:35:10.572
- Boom!!!
- Wow, 100!

01:35:10.573 --> 01:35:11.994
Yea Seong... 100..

01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:15.630
Great job, Yea Seong!!

01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:18.491
When she gets older
I should let her try to be a model or actress

01:35:19.536 --> 01:35:20.236
bullshit

01:35:21.562 --> 01:35:22.919
the baby looks so funny

01:35:24.317 --> 01:35:26.668
- that dude is...
- Too honest.

01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:28.049
Sorry

01:35:45.124 --> 01:35:51.108
(can you hear me)

01:35:51.108 --> 01:35:53.108
chi..

01:35:53.908 --> 01:35:55.408
Ef...

01:35:55.873 --> 01:35:57.759
C...H... I..

01:35:58.118 --> 01:35:59.818
E...F...

01:36:10.591 --> 01:36:11.871
How many hours more do you need!

01:36:18.342 --> 01:36:19.742
C...H...

01:36:20.716 --> 01:36:23.769
I heard there will be a talent show
for prisoners.

01:36:23.769 --> 01:36:25.768
Shouldn't we prepare for it?

01:36:26.594 --> 01:36:28.094
Who's barking here!?

01:36:28.561 --> 01:36:30.441
If we win the first, do they let us walk away!?

01:36:31.465 --> 01:36:32.414
Yes, they will let us walk away.

01:36:32.971 --> 01:36:34.671
One night outing with family

01:36:35.029 --> 01:36:35.660
really!?

01:36:36.039 --> 01:36:38.745
- Yea Seong.
- What should we do? Sing in chorus?

01:36:39.509 --> 01:36:40.209
Let's sing..

01:36:41.029 --> 01:36:42.468
- SailorMoon.
- Yeah, let's try sailormoon.

01:36:42.468 --> 01:36:46.266
So childish.

01:36:50.412 --> 01:36:52.683
Chief, this special pardon in chirstmas,

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:54.623
so many of them ..

01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:58.470
Is it because of the end of the presiden

01:36:59.598 --> 01:37:01.670
I guess so..

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.340
We got so many ..to send..

01:37:10.688 --> 01:37:11.188
Excuse me?

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.278
We got a schedule for 5482
December 23.

01:37:23.662 --> 01:37:24.888

01:37:25.588 --> 01:37:27.079
- Spider.
- Louder.

01:37:27.627 --> 01:37:29.858
- Spider.
- How about this one?

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:30.928
What?

01:37:32.919 --> 01:37:33.678
This one..

01:38:01.053 --> 01:38:04.245
That's not what I can't..
Decide myself..

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:08.922
I need a permission first
from the principal.

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:10.810
This will be the last.

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:13.153
Yes?

01:38:17.472 --> 01:38:19.072
Last day for Yea Seong to see her father..

01:38:22.274 --> 01:38:23.174
Please..

01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:27.342
Please allow..

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.960
What the fuck..

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:39.650
It's been only few days after the trial,
execution of a death penalty!? what the fuck..

01:38:40.512 --> 01:38:42.312
We need to protest about this

01:38:42.865 --> 01:38:46.712
even if the trial went that way,
This is totally against the law

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:50.754
what the hell ..order..
I should go first than him..

01:38:51.404 --> 01:38:54.696
So many guys to go first
in this prison

01:39:00.887 --> 01:39:03.287
we can't send YongGoo like this..

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:05.920
Hey Chun Ho.

01:39:32.115 --> 01:39:34.679
This is to save a life
how's that sound?

01:39:35.018 --> 01:39:37.856
Give me your area

01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:44.036
- One.

01:39:45.213 --> 01:39:46.753
What the heck

Go back to work, work

01:40:14.506 --> 01:40:18.830

If you think a guy behind the curtain is your father,

01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:20.053
any prisoners?

01:40:20.054 --> 01:40:23.198
Make it work
this is to save one's life!

01:40:23.637 --> 01:40:24.137
Yes, sir

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:32.004
- what happened to our dude?
- It takes longer, it's fucking big.

01:40:32.204 --> 01:40:35.063
He isn't your father, I guarantee, right?

01:40:39.019 --> 01:40:40.067
Why are you up here?

01:40:45.236 --> 01:40:48.312
All of fathers in this world,
they are all my father

01:40:52.493 --> 01:40:53.516
cheer up!

01:41:18.987 --> 01:41:21.991
♪ Late night, late night

Is everything under the control?

01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:49.382
Brother, Yea Seong's teacher is also with me
