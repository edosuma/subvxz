RALPH: Please, Fonz, please!
We've got an emergency here,

01:24.184 --> 01:25.618
my car's got a dead battery,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.482
so we thought
maybe we could hook up

01:27.621 --> 01:28.679
the cables to Al's truck.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.119
Yeah, please, Fonz,
we need the car.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.884
We're taking the Drinkwater
twins to the drive-in.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.051
Oh, yeah?
Well, then why don't you hook up

01:34.194 --> 01:35.787
-the Drinkwater twins?
-(all laugh)

01:35.929 --> 01:39.160
It's funny working with him!

01:39.299 --> 01:40.630
All right, take the cables.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.736
- You just bring 'em back
tonight. -Oh, thanks, Fonz!

01:42.869 --> 01:44.997
All right, they're under there
over the table, by the table.

01:45.138 --> 01:46.231
- You can trust us.
- Yeah. -Thanks, Fonz, thanks.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.671
- Hey.
- No touch, no touch.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.403
- RALPH: Hi, Lori.
- POTSIE: Hi, Lori.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.212
I'd like to introduce to you,
the Wild One himself,

01:59.353 --> 02:02.379
Richie "Wheelie" Cunningham!

02:02.522 --> 02:03.888
Bravo!

02:04.024 --> 02:05.514
Yeah!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.890
You got a bike!

02:09.029 --> 02:10.588
Hey, Rich, Rich,
this is a beaut!

02:10.731 --> 02:11.925
Yeah, isn't it neat?

02:12.065 --> 02:14.534
I just brought it down here
so Fonz could, you know,

02:14.668 --> 02:16.261
check it out,
give me a few tips.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.462
He's gonna love this!
It's the best bike in Milwaukee.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.869
(clanking)

02:21.008 --> 02:23.602
And, Fonz,
uh, what do you think?

02:23.744 --> 02:24.938
It's-it's nice, huh?

02:25.078 --> 02:27.570
First of all, bikes
are not nice, they're cool.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.047
Second of all, you want
to be a big leaguer,

02:30.183 --> 02:31.708
you talk like the big leagues.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.547
Right, Fonz. Well, it is cool.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.849
- I should have done this
a long time ago. -Yeah, yeah.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.117
Richie Cunningham with a bike.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.386
Well, I guess Milwaukee's
big enough for two Fonzies.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.427
There's only one Fonz.
Right, Chach?

02:42.562 --> 02:44.155
- Right, Ralph.
- We were just leaving, Fonz.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.232
- Nice bike, Rich. See you.
- Yeah, great bike, Rich.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.027
No, no, bikes are cool,
they're not nice!

02:48.168 --> 02:49.226
Cool, cool.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.666
Thanks again
for the cables, Fonz.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.896
Follow those clowns,

02:52.039 --> 02:53.973
make sure they don't knot up
my cables, huh?

02:54.107 --> 02:55.632
Right, Fonz. Oh, uh, I forgot.

02:55.776 --> 02:56.674
Rochelle called before.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.075
Rochelle.

03:00.213 --> 03:03.149
What a beauty mark.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.774
I never saw a beauty mark.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.047
And you never will.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.886
Fonz, uh, how'd you like
to double on motorcycles?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.927
Hey, great. Leather's in
the office. We'll triple-date.

03:15.062 --> 03:18.088
Well, Chachi, I doubt if Leather
wants to ride on a motorcycle

03:18.231 --> 03:19.563
that has training wheels.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.724
(laughs)

03:20.867 --> 03:22.528
He's a kid, training wheels...

03:22.669 --> 03:24.694
It's not easy being
second mechanic.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.863
- The cables.
- Right, Fonz.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.839
All right.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.273
Want your first lesson?

03:30.410 --> 03:31.400
- Yeah.
- Man your bike.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.639
Oh, right. Hop on, L.B.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.444
L.B., the owner gets on first.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.780
Oh, yeah.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.513
Where should I put my hands?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.021
Oh, just, uh, keep looking.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.117
How's this?

03:46.259 --> 03:47.591
Oh, yeah, that's cute,
that's cute, okay.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.663
Okay, I'm gonna start it,
uh, key's on,

03:50.797 --> 03:53.926
I, I already got it in neutral.
Here we go.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.901
Not so good, Richie.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.403
No, no, I'll get it,
I'll get it. It's...

03:59.539 --> 04:02.532
Hey.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.872
Do-si-do, and around you go...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.414
We're not doing square dances
here, you understand that?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.075
All right, now assume
it started.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.311
- Oh, all right.
- All right.

04:13.453 --> 04:16.446
(makes revving sounds)

04:18.358 --> 04:21.089
Cunningham... I think you're,

04:21.228 --> 04:22.456
you're exceeding
the speed limit here.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.790
Oh, yeah.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.899
- Now, you're just cruising
down the street. -Right.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.001
Here comes a stop sign.
What are you gonna do?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.534
Okay, uh, here comes
a stop sign,

04:29.669 --> 04:31.365
I'm going to, uh,
put on the brake

04:31.505 --> 04:32.665
and screech to a halt.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.865
(makes screech sound)

04:35.008 --> 04:36.066
(engine idling sound)

04:37.310 --> 04:39.301
- Now what?
- Well, now the cop comes up

04:39.446 --> 04:40.914
and gives you a ticket

04:41.047 --> 04:42.310
'cause you just pulled
the clutch

04:42.449 --> 04:43.939
and went right through
the stop sign.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.517
What, that-that's the clutch?

04:45.652 --> 04:47.484
That's right. Here's your brake
right here.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.851
Son of a gun, you know
they look exactly alike?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.151
How are you supposed
to know which is which?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.782
Well, one'll kill ya.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.294
It'll be good
if I remember that.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.863
Yeah.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.558
Hey, gang.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.398
- Hi, Leather. -Hi, Leather.
- How you doing?

05:05.539 --> 05:07.837
I just talked to my agent.
I got a gig tonight.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.567
- Oh, that's great. -That's
great. -Hey, that's great.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.405
Oh, wow, Fonzie,
you got a new bike.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.478
Hold it.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.478
The Fonz don't get a new bike.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.482
Do you think the Lone Ranger
would trade in his Silver?

05:17.617 --> 05:19.552
No, no, no, this is my bike.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.917
All 650cc's of it.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.683
That's motorcycle talk.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.521
(horn beeps)

05:27.661 --> 05:30.187
That's horn talk.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.729
Listen, Fonz,
the gig is in Waukegan.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.594
Can you give me a lift
to the bus?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.065
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, great.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.729
And then I'll meet Rochelle and
play "Connect the beauty marks."

05:38.872 --> 05:39.737
- Fonz.
- Yeah.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.170
I think I'm gonna take this out

05:41.308 --> 05:42.798
for just a little spin
around the block

05:42.943 --> 05:44.206
before you look it over.
Is that all right?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.573
Yeah, that's cool.
All right, just take it slow.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.077
- Right.
- All right?

05:47.214 --> 05:48.579
I'll be back, we'll spend
a couple of hours together,

05:48.715 --> 05:49.910
you'll be zooming down that road
in no time.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.746
- Oh, that's gonna be great.
-(horn beeps)

05:52.886 --> 05:55.378
The first thing we do when I get
back: disconnect the horn.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.387
Thanks.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.082
See you later, huh?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.214
- Yeah.
- Bye, Fonz.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.349
- Now, you on?
- Yeah.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.586
Okay,

06:01.728 --> 06:03.719
I got past the first part
of getting the bike.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.593
Now I got to get past
the second part,

06:05.732 --> 06:06.858
telling my folks about it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.229
You didn't tell
your parents yet?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.597
Don't worry.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.568
Wheelie Cunningham
will win 'em over.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.374
Oh, hi, everybody.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.978
- HOWARD: Richard.
- MARION: Hi, Richard.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.742
Hi. Oh, man,
I'm really glad to be home.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.215
Mom, you're really looking good
tonight.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.411
What-- did you do something
to your hair?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.680
Uh-uh, no.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.756
Oh, well,
it's just beautiful. It's...

06:30.890 --> 06:33.485
Dad... Dad...

06:33.627 --> 06:36.152
how was your day
at the store, huh?

06:36.296 --> 06:38.924
Hey, Joanie. Hey,
cute daughter you got there.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.465
You know something, Dad?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.126
You have done an excellent job
raising this whole family.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.795
All right, Richard,
what do you want?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.600
What do I want?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.709
Oh, no, I-l don't want anything.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.243
I'm just full of love tonight.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.903
You're full of something.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.582
Mom, what are we having
for dinner, huh?

06:57.717 --> 06:58.810
You know,
I'll tell you something.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.648
Nobody makes a dinner
like my mom.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.223
- Peanut butter.
- Peanut butter?

07:04.357 --> 07:07.020
Oh, good, good,
I love peanut butter.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.423
Your father ate all the chops.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.154
That's okay, Dad.
I would have given them

07:10.297 --> 07:11.457
to you if I had been here.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.499
Now let's stop this nonsense.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.068
Now tell us what happened, huh?

07:16.202 --> 07:18.694
All right, all right.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.272
I, uh...

07:20.407 --> 07:23.399
(muttering):
I got a motorcycle.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.533
(clears throat)

07:24.678 --> 07:25.838
What, Richard?
I didn't hear you.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.378
I, I just said that I...

07:27.514 --> 07:30.142
(mumbling):
...got a motorcycle.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.684
Will you take your hand away
from your mouth?!

07:32.819 --> 07:34.014
It sounded like you said,

07:34.154 --> 07:36.350
-"I just bought a motorcycle."
- I got a motorcycle.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.550
Well, Richard, y-you should have
asked us first!

07:39.693 --> 07:41.388
That is out of the question!

07:41.528 --> 07:44.395
Now wait a minute.
I think this is pretty unfair.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.624
You know, I'm always being
treated like a kid around here.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.427
Join the club.

07:48.568 --> 07:49.865
- All right, you want fair?
- Yeah.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.493
You give me one good reason

07:51.638 --> 07:53.436
why we should let you have
a motorcycle.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.303
That's easy.
It's very cheap on gas.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.467
- Good point.
- Thanks, Joanie.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.170
But it evens out
with medical bills.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.839
- Will you go to your room?
- Okay, okay.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.144
If you don't want my advice...

08:05.285 --> 08:07.219
Why do you want a motorcycle?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.412
All right, number two,

08:08.555 --> 08:10.284
it's always easy
to find a parking space.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.323
All right, so it's cheap on gas

08:12.459 --> 08:14.859
and you can find
a parking space.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.360
But I absolutely forbid it!

08:16.496 --> 08:17.361
Good, Howard.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.692
"Forbid it"?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.129
"Good, Howard"?

08:20.266 --> 08:21.598
All right, all right,
all right, fine,

08:21.735 --> 08:23.293
you're gonna treat me
like a baby, I'll be a baby.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.870
You want a baby?
Here's a baby!

08:25.004 --> 08:27.132
<i>(subs)</i>

08:27.273 --> 08:28.741
HOWARD:
You want to be a baby?

08:28.875 --> 08:29.933
MARION:
I can't believe this!

08:30.076 --> 08:31.567
I've never seen you act
like this, Richard.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.304
(overlapping chatter)

08:34.447 --> 08:35.938
- That's terrible. -Spending
your own money like that.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.143
L-I love this,
my little stepfamily,

08:39.284 --> 08:42.187
full of spunk and vinegar,
you know.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.812
Here's my bottle of rent.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.324
I don't want to say anything,
but he's sucking his thumb.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.864
Yeah.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.160
That's right, that's right.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.792
They treat me like a baby,
so I'm gonna be a baby.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.461
I'm gonna suck my thumb.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.608
L-I don't think
I'm ever gonna understand

09:02.742 --> 09:04.733
a middle-class family.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.142
Arthur, now Richard is getting
a motorcycle,

09:07.280 --> 09:08.873
and we don't think it's safe.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.450
Now, Mrs. C., wait a minute.
I checked it out.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.076
He's a good driver,
it's in good shape, huh?

09:14.220 --> 09:17.884
Yeah, but it's my son's shape
that I'm worried about, Fonzie.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.321
You know, there are some people

09:19.459 --> 09:21.188
that should not ride
motorcycles.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.193
You know,
I totally agree with you.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.763
Potsie is a good example.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.058
And Richard, too.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.635
No, Richie wouldn't ride right
in the middle of a fruit stand.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.260
Potsie did that?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.804
Yeah. He hit head-on,

09:32.939 --> 09:34.805
right in the middle
of these, uh, honeydew melons.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.966
It took us about an hour
to find his head.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.545
(laughs)
That's funny.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.171
MARION:
Oh!

09:42.315 --> 09:43.612
You see, Richard?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.741
Even Arthur says it's dangerous.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.320
Oh, now wait a minute.
Fonzie did not say that.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.717
He said it's dangerous
for Potsie.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.085
Right.

09:51.224 --> 09:55.252
Walking is dangerous for Potsie.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.660
Now, look, Mr. C., Mrs. C.,
if it makes you feel any better,

09:58.798 --> 10:02.234
I checked out the bike,
I took Richie for a ride,

10:02.368 --> 10:04.735
he did very, very well, huh?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.100
Of course, I suggest

10:06.239 --> 10:08.401
he takes the thumb out
of his mouth, but...

10:08.541 --> 10:09.531
Well...

10:09.676 --> 10:12.202
Dad, Dad, look, I bought
the bike with money

10:12.345 --> 10:13.779
that I saved working
in the band.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.848
Now, you said
that I was old enough now,

10:15.982 --> 10:17.211
you said I was an adult.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.750
No, he just said
you were old enough

10:18.885 --> 10:20.080
to make your own decisions.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.246
Yeah! Well, that's my decision,
to buy a motorcycle.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.187
You're not old enough.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.558
Well, I did say
you were an adult, Richard,

10:29.696 --> 10:32.665
so I guess I at least have
to let you try it.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.631
Oh, thanks, Dad.

10:34.767 --> 10:35.894
Is your thumb dry?

10:36.035 --> 10:38.698
Oh. Will be, Will be.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.772
All right, all right,
there you go. That settles it.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.739
Now just do me a favor,
you take it nice and slow.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.740
All right.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.040
And you wear your helmet
and never smile.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.346
But never smile?
Why?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.748
'Cause you get bugs
in your teeth.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.651
(laughs)

10:56.789 --> 10:59.258
Bugs in your teeth...
I don't think it's very funny.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.759
Well, don't worry, Marion.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.522
If Fonzie gave him
some pointers,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.961
I'm sure he's gonna be
just fine.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.828
(motorcycle roars)

11:07.967 --> 11:09.298
(tires squeal,
motorcycle departs)

11:14.941 --> 11:17.603
Man, did you hear that?
Wasn't that terrific?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.372
I would never do that.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.421
That's it, Al, keep it turned.
A little more.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.854
Keep pushing, guys.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.084
Come on, Pots, push.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.955
We've got to get
to the drive-in.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.290
I am pushing.
Chach, why aren't you helping?

11:37.430 --> 11:40.161
Did you ever hear
of child labor laws?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.995
Boy, Pots, you should have
been more careful

11:42.135 --> 11:43.295
with that jumper cable.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.927
Put the fire out, didn't I?

11:45.071 --> 11:48.006
Boys, quit,
quit arguing and push!

11:48.141 --> 11:49.131
We're here, Al.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.209
Oh. Oh, yeah.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.472
(grunts)
Thanks, guys.

11:53.613 --> 11:58.448
Hey, you know, I had
the emergency brake on?

11:58.585 --> 12:01.247
For 20 blocks?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.413
It holds pretty good.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.786
Hey, Fonz! Fonzie!

12:05.925 --> 12:07.359
He's not here.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.088
You brought me to a garage
without a mechanic?

12:10.229 --> 12:12.221
- That's right.
- No sweat.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.060
Chachi, number two mechanic,
is on duty.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.396
Oh, Chachi,
promise me one thing.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.800
You won't take the truck apart
and sell it?

12:18.938 --> 12:21.134
How much do you think
we can get for it?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.436
That's funny.
Even tired, I got it.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.601
I think I know what's wrong
with it, Al.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.270
What a mess, what a mess.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.575
Oh, no problem, guys,
it's in good hands.

12:29.716 --> 12:33.618
Look, Pots, you had to hook
the cable to the carburetor?

12:34.887 --> 12:36.082
I can't believe it.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.122
We finally get a date
with the Drinkwater twins

12:38.257 --> 12:40.123
and we blow up two cars!

12:40.259 --> 12:41.625
(engine starts)

12:41.761 --> 12:43.024
(whooping, shouting)

12:43.162 --> 12:44.323
Drinkwater twins,
Drinkwater twins,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.330
- Drinkwater twins...
- Keep it going, keep it going...

12:46.466 --> 12:48.263
Help, somebody, help!

12:48.401 --> 12:49.300
What happened?

12:49.435 --> 12:50.664
- We crashed!
- What?

12:50.803 --> 12:52.032
- You crashed?
- Are you all right?

12:52.171 --> 12:53.798
Not me. Richie--
he's lying in the street.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.409
He's not moving,
he's not moving!

12:56.542 --> 12:58.101
- Come on!
- Let's go! -Let's go!

12:58.244 --> 12:59.507
- AL: Chachi...
- Let's go!

12:59.646 --> 13:01.637
...you stay with her.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.074

13:19.065 --> 13:22.262
DOCTOR: Your son is
in critical condition.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.461
If he comes out of the coma soon
and regains consciousness,

13:24.604 --> 13:25.935
he should be all right.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.065
If?

13:28.207 --> 13:30.699
No, no, he-he-he didn't mean
"if," Marion,

13:30.843 --> 13:32.641
he meant when he comes
out of the coma.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.804
You-you meant "when,"
didn't you, Doc?

13:35.848 --> 13:38.181
He had a very bad fall,
Mr. Cunningham.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.808
We'll just have to wait and see.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.148
Dear God...

13:47.694 --> 13:50.163
It's a good thing
he was wearing his helmet.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.661
It could have been worse.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.595
Now there's...

13:53.733 --> 13:55.792
really nothing that
you people can do here.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.528
Why don't you just go home?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.661
Well, I-in just a minute.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.035
Oh, Howard, this is all
like a bad dream.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.478
All right now, sweetheart,
he-he's going to be all right.

14:09.615 --> 14:10.844
He's getting the best of care.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.975
Richie will be fine.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.712
Yeah.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.845
Come on, Mom.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.051
Oh, Arthur...

14:21.194 --> 14:22.252
Yeah, I know.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.091
Hi, Red.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.128
I'm right here with you.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.442
How is he?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.046
Well, he's...
not very good, Fonzie,

14:40.179 --> 14:42.842
but there is a chance.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.973
Is there anything I can do?

14:46.619 --> 14:47.518
Nothing.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.713
Come on, let's go home.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.843
<i>JQANE: Thanks for
coming over, everybody.</i>

15:16.983 --> 15:19.145
<i>AL: Let's have something to eat
while we're waiting.</i>

15:19.285 --> 15:21.686
MARION:
Here.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.084
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Al. -Hi, Al.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.087
Any news?

15:24.223 --> 15:25.953
No change, so far.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.491
No, but he's going
to be all right.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.254
He's-he's a very tough kid.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.886
Sure he is.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.964
Well, I'm gonna
clean this house.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.897
Marion, you cleaned the house
this morning.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.163
Let's have some macaroni
and cheese, all right?

15:39.305 --> 15:40.864
<i>L-I'll</i> have a bite, Al.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.372
I could go for one helping.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.977
- Oh, kids, how they can eat.
- Yeah.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.944
I remember one time Richie...

15:53.986 --> 15:55.977
Changed my mind.
I'm not hungry.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.482
Now listen to me, everybody.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.689
Richard's been in an accident

16:03.830 --> 16:05.491
and he's been badly hurt.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.463
Okay, people get badly hurt

16:07.600 --> 16:09.466
and get sick every single day.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.297
The only thing is,

16:11.437 --> 16:12.871
we always think
it's only gonna happen

16:13.005 --> 16:14.371
to somebody else's family.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.168
Well, now it's happened to ours,

16:16.309 --> 16:18.607
and we have to deal with it.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.043
And right now
that's what I'm trying to do,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.342
and I say that Richard
is going to be all right.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.713
MARION:
Of course he is.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.319
And we're just very grateful

16:27.453 --> 16:29.820
that Richard has
friends that care.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.617
(playing quietly)

17:08.426 --> 17:10.419
<i>II</i>

17:36.689 --> 17:38.680
<i>II</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:04.239
(piano stops)

18:12.425 --> 18:14.416
His condition is stable.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.551
We'll just have to wait and see.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.718
How you doin', Red?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.365
They wouldn't let me stay
before, but I'm here now.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.272
Chachi says hello.
"Hello."

19:00.406 --> 19:02.704
He loves working down
at that garage, you know.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.812
You can't do this, uh, Red.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.677
A lot of people counting on you,
you know.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.343
Your mother,
your father, Joanie...

19:14.487 --> 19:16.478
Ralph, Potsie...

19:18.090 --> 19:19.114
You can't go yet,

19:19.258 --> 19:21.249
you got a whole lifetime
ahead of you, you know?

19:23.429 --> 19:24.589
I mean, you didn't even make

19:24.730 --> 19:26.130
the editor of that
college paper yet.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.199
There's a lot of...
crummy journalism around,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.325
you got to make it all straight.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.503
They need you.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.630
(scoffs)

19:41.580 --> 19:43.572
(choked up):
I need you.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.249
You're my best friend.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.050
I know I never said that before,
but I'm saying it now.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.960
You are my best friend.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.120
And I don't want to lose you.

20:06.972 --> 20:10.773
Hey, uh... sir?

20:10.910 --> 20:12.776
Got to have a little chat here.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.938
It's my best friend Richie.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.073
Now, he's in really bad shape.

20:19.985 --> 20:23.183
Yeah, I know you know that.

20:23.322 --> 20:26.087
But, uh, the world is kind of
going a little wacko, you know,

20:26.225 --> 20:28.592
and, uh, you need...

20:28.727 --> 20:31.856
you need people
down here like him.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.989
(sobbing):
And if you don't, I do.

20:37.036 --> 20:41.871
Now... I can fix a lot
of things, but, uh...

20:42.007 --> 20:44.602
this one is all yours.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.712
So, uh...

20:46.846 --> 20:48.438
let's make a little deal.

20:53.219 --> 20:56.882
You do this for me...

20:57.022 --> 20:59.014
and I'll owe you one.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.327
Heyyy.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.862
(sobbing)

21:23.682 --> 21:25.275
Will you look at that?

21:25.417 --> 21:27.147
He must have
stayed here all night.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.414
Fonzie? Fonzie.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.050
Arthur, it's morning.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.184
Have you been here all night?

21:36.328 --> 21:38.558
Yeah, I guess I fell asleep.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.359
Doctor said it was
all right, though.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.263
Well, you go home now.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.562
Go on home, Fonzie.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.364
We'll tell Richard
you were here.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.473
I don't think
I'm going to leave here.

21:47.606 --> 21:50.371
Well, Arthur, you just go home
now and get some sleep.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.772
Yeah, Marion's right.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.845
Yeah, you're both right,
but I ain't going.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.640
- We're going to stay here...
- Fonzie, it doesn't

21:55.781 --> 21:57.715
-do you any good...
- There's a lot of food at home.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.942
Why don't you just go?
We're gonna be here.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.313
HOWARD: You're not going
to do yourself any good

22:00.452 --> 22:01.317
-by staying here...
- There's food there,

22:01.453 --> 22:02.614
you can go and get some rest.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.018
- HOWARD: Come on, now...
- Will you people quiet down?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.487
You're giving me a headache.

22:05.624 --> 22:07.251
Quiet, Richard,
and don't interrupt your father.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.622
Thank you, Marion.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.524
Now, look, Fon...

22:10.663 --> 22:11.687
Richard!

22:11.830 --> 22:12.889
- Oh, Richard!
- Richard?

22:13.032 --> 22:14.693
- You're okay!
- Are you all right?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.165
- Are you all right, dear?
- Doctor! Doctor!

22:16.302 --> 22:17.496
FONZIE:
Oh, man, it is good to see you.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.831
- Hey! -Oh, you gave us
a terrible scare.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.996
I-ls... is Lori Beth all right?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.130
- Oh, she's fine, just fine.
- Yes.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.537
Oh, good.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.837
Hey.

22:25.978 --> 22:26.843
How do you feel?

22:26.979 --> 22:29.414
Well, uh...

22:29.548 --> 22:31.073
I feel kind of hungry.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.081
Oh...

22:32.218 --> 22:33.583
- That's a good sign.
- Yeah.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.312
Oh, Richard.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.445
Oh, I'm so glad
to see your eyes open...

22:40.426 --> 22:42.417
Heyyy.

23:04.650 --> 23:05.913
All right. All right.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.383
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.078
All right, try this.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.780
Hmm? Huh?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.914
- Yeah. (laughs)
- Ah.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.664
I told you he'd be
his old self before long.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.426
(clears throat loudly)

23:22.568 --> 23:23.660
- Oh, hello, Mr...
-(yells)

23:23.802 --> 23:26.704
"Oh!
-(g roams)

23:26.839 --> 23:28.830
- Oh, yeah. (laughs)
- Yeah.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.533
- Hi, Mom... Dad.
- Hi, Lori Beth.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.906
Richard,
your motorcycle's fixed.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.342
No, no, I'm not keeping that.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.970
I'm-I'm getting rid
of that motorcycle.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.048
Good.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.047
Yeah, you know, I wanted

23:38.183 --> 23:39.116
one of those for so long,

23:39.251 --> 23:40.184
and then when I got it,

23:40.319 --> 23:42.481
I was scared to death
to ride it.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.055
I don't know,
I-l just don't think

23:44.189 --> 23:45.987
I'm suited for a motorcycle.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.491
Well, it wouldn't
have been much fun

23:48.627 --> 23:49.822
at the drive-in anyway.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.829
I would have had to hold
the speaker the whole time.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.398
(laughs)

23:56.435 --> 23:57.630
Let's get something to eat.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.328
I think they want to be alone.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.632
Yeah.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.866
I'll never forget this week.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.339
Well, Marion...

24:04.476 --> 24:06.911
no one said it was easy
being a parent.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.708
I know.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.840
But it can be so painful.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.849
I'm just going to walk Lori Beth
out to her car.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.148
Say good night for us, dear.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.882
Yeah.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.549
Say, uh...

24:20.693 --> 24:22.183
I-I guess I must have
put you through

24:22.328 --> 24:24.193
a lot this week and, uh...

24:24.330 --> 24:25.354
with the accident
and everything...

24:25.497 --> 24:26.988
Oh, don't worry about it,
Richard.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.600
It's all part of being a parent.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.758
Thanks.

24:29.902 --> 24:30.892
I'll see you.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.163
- HOWARD: Night.
- MARION: Night.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.102
Quite a son.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.104
LORI BETH (giggling):
Richie...

24:35.240 --> 24:36.538
He's quite a Casanova.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.075
Takes after his father.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.336
That's right.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.708
Eat your cookie, Casanova.
