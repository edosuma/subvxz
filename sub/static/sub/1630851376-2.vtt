that I passed on Michael Chabon
for this job.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.180
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.382
- Oh, Chabon was up for this?
- Yep.

07:46.482 --> 07:47.543
- Chabon was up for this.

07:47.643 --> 07:49.104
- I know, I'm right here.
- Huh.

07:49.204 --> 07:50.786
- There was just
something missing

07:50.886 --> 07:52.187
that I need my book
to tap into.

07:52.287 --> 07:53.548
And I can already tell

07:53.648 --> 07:54.869
that you are gonna get that
out of me.

07:54.969 --> 07:56.951
- Oh.

07:57.051 --> 07:59.153
She was great. She was great.

07:59.253 --> 08:00.914
Just like that food.
It's amazing.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.196
- It was fine.

08:03.296 --> 08:06.159
- Uh-oh. Something's up.

08:06.259 --> 08:07.400
- You don't think
she was a little much?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.082
With the bossiness
and the laughing

08:10.182 --> 08:11.884
and the hitting on you?

08:11.984 --> 08:14.246
- Whoa. Hitting on me?

08:14.346 --> 08:17.609
- "Oh my god, Tom.
You're so funny.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.250
"Oh, Tom, you are so clever.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.092
"Oh, Tom, I read your book
in one sitting

08:21.192 --> 08:23.013
on my perfect bottom."

08:23.113 --> 08:25.055
- C'mon, maybe that's
just the friendliness

08:25.155 --> 08:26.776
of her Mexican culture.

08:26.876 --> 08:28.858
- She's Puerto Rican.

08:28.958 --> 08:31.140
- Yeah, no, I knew that.
I knew that.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.502
So what, you just don't want me
to take the gig?

08:33.602 --> 08:35.424
- I don't know.
Let's sleep on it.

08:35.524 --> 08:37.786
- You know what?

08:37.886 --> 08:41.309
I like your...perfect bottom.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.830
- Not tonight. I'm very full.

08:42.930 --> 08:45.472
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:45.572 --> 08:49.076
- I was making my first batch
of almond milk when it hit me.

08:49.176 --> 08:51.438
We gotta stop
killing cows for milk.

08:51.538 --> 08:53.159
- Mm.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.161
Can you believe
he's making nut milk?

08:55.261 --> 08:57.963
- I can't believe any of this.

08:58.063 --> 09:00.525
- He's got a long way to go,
but he's willing to learn.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.007
And I enjoy being his tutor.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.108
[both laugh]

09:05.950 --> 09:06.851
- Is there a problem?

09:06.951 --> 09:08.372
- It's just Connor's wokeness,

09:08.472 --> 09:10.974
it's so obviously just an act
to impress Lindsay.

09:11.074 --> 09:12.416
Should we say something?
We should say something.

09:12.516 --> 09:13.977
- Sarah, I love this book.

09:14.077 --> 09:16.059
And I have a lot
to offer today.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.941
I found subtext, allusions,
I found a leitmotif.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.342
Please don't ruin this for me.
- But I just feel like--

09:20.442 --> 09:21.343
- Just don't.
- If I could--

09:21.443 --> 09:24.226
- Don't. Don't.

09:24.326 --> 09:25.206
We're gonna have
a good time, all right?

09:25.286 --> 09:27.508
- Yeah.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.551
[doorbell rings]

09:30.651 --> 09:32.993
- Sofía. Hi.
- Hey.

09:33.093 --> 09:34.875
I'm sorry
to drop by unannounced.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.437
I just found my afternoon free,
and I thought I'd pop by.

09:37.537 --> 09:40.159
- Oh.

09:40.259 --> 09:41.801
Kay...

09:41.901 --> 09:43.482
- you know, I know you haven't
made up your mind

09:43.582 --> 09:44.883
about us working together,

09:44.983 --> 09:46.685
so I wanted to continue
the conversation

09:46.785 --> 09:47.766
and really get to know
each other

09:47.866 --> 09:49.868
with no distractions.

09:51.509 --> 09:54.011
- Okay. Look, my wife, Marina--

09:54.111 --> 09:56.133
- You told me she'd be
at that birthday party.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.015
With the soggy pizza.
[laughs]

09:58.115 --> 09:59.576
God, you're funny.

09:59.676 --> 10:00.857
[cork pops]

10:00.957 --> 10:03.319
- [laughs uncomfortably]

10:05.761 --> 10:06.842
- Before we start,
let's go ahead and thank Connor

10:06.922 --> 10:07.983
for generously opening
his home for us.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.184
[applause]
- Oh, please.

10:09.284 --> 10:10.785
As the Buddha once said,

10:10.885 --> 10:13.268
"When you're here,
you're family."

10:13.368 --> 10:15.790
- Let's open our books
and our minds.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.231
"An Unquiet Heart."

10:17.331 --> 10:20.434
Harrowing, of course,
but also joyful...

10:20.534 --> 10:23.516
[laughs]
Funny, maddening.

10:23.616 --> 10:26.039
Opening thoughts? Feelings?
- I was thinking about--

10:26.139 --> 10:28.140
- What did you think
of the book, Connor?

10:29.662 --> 10:31.663
- Um, the book?

10:33.625 --> 10:36.167
I think...

10:36.267 --> 10:38.089
you know,
I think Saanvi's journey

10:38.189 --> 10:39.930
really resonated with me.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.532
I mean, I must admit,

10:41.632 --> 10:43.133
I wasn't very educated
on the refugee crisis,

10:43.233 --> 10:45.255
so this was a big eye-opener
for me

10:45.355 --> 10:47.617
about environmental racism.

10:47.717 --> 10:49.058
- Mm.
- Yeah.

10:49.158 --> 10:51.380
- Did he actually
read the book?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.562
- Environmental racism
was my big opening.

10:55.564 --> 10:56.945
- Cooking is such
a sensual act.

10:57.045 --> 10:58.386
Keeping something at a simmer

10:58.486 --> 11:00.268
until it's time
to turn up the heat.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.869
- [chuckles]
I wouldn't know.

11:01.969 --> 11:04.632
I'm more of a make out guy---
takeout guy.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.833
- I once cooked this
for Chiwetel Ejiofor

11:06.933 --> 11:07.834
before we made love.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.155
Here.
- Oh, I--

11:09.255 --> 11:11.317
- Ah...
- [stammering]

11:11.417 --> 11:12.478
Mmm.
- Ooh.

11:12.578 --> 11:13.960
[both laugh]

11:14.060 --> 11:15.161
I got it. I got it.
- You got it?

11:15.261 --> 11:18.203
- Yeah. It's a little spicy.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.526
You know, I'm big fan
of Chiwe...

11:21.626 --> 11:22.807
- Chiwetel.
- That guy. Yeah.

11:22.907 --> 11:24.569
I liked his interpretation
of Karl Mordo

11:24.669 --> 11:26.250
in the "Doctor Strange" movie.

11:26.350 --> 11:29.973
Could I use the bathroom?
I gotta use the bathroom.

11:30.073 --> 11:32.175
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi. How you doin'?

11:32.275 --> 11:33.616
How's that
birthday party going?

11:33.716 --> 11:36.219
- Well, turns out Alejandro's
afraid of magicians.

11:36.319 --> 11:38.421
- Oh, great. Great to hear.

11:38.521 --> 11:40.903
Look, I've been thinking
about last night, and,

11:41.003 --> 11:42.264
you know, I think
you might've been right.

11:42.364 --> 11:44.266
Sofía might've been
flirting with me.

11:44.366 --> 11:45.867
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.108
Just kinda playing it back
in my head,

11:47.208 --> 11:48.469
and I can see
what you were saying.

11:48.569 --> 11:49.590
Also, she's here right now.

11:49.690 --> 11:52.072
- Here as in there?
- Yep.

11:52.172 --> 11:53.674
There's been cooking and wine

11:53.774 --> 11:56.636
and some of that...
light arm touching.

11:56.736 --> 11:58.077
I mean, don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.278
She's not my type.

11:59.378 --> 12:01.000
- She's a hot Latina, Tom.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.561
Of course she's your type.

12:02.661 --> 12:06.324
I'm sorry. I'm on with Tom.
This woman is hitting on him.

12:06.424 --> 12:09.167
Yeah, no. My Tom.
I know, it's weird.

12:09.267 --> 12:10.928
- What--is that Liza?

12:11.028 --> 12:12.330
You can tell her
it's not that weird.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.611
Look, what do you
want me to do?

12:13.711 --> 12:15.092
I can't kick her out.
- Use your standby.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.373
Tell her
you're having stomach issues.

12:16.473 --> 12:17.814
- I already did.

12:17.914 --> 12:18.795
That's how I got in here
to talk to you.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.217
- Tom, I'm ready for you.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.319
- I gotta go.

12:25.921 --> 12:27.423
- Just wanted to say,
I'm impressed.

12:27.523 --> 12:29.424
Reading a 500-page book
in three days,

12:29.524 --> 12:31.626
breaking your
previous record of...

12:31.726 --> 12:33.468
any length of book
in any amount days.

12:33.568 --> 12:34.949
- Booch?
- No thanks.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.390
- I actually listened
to the audiobook.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.312
- Ha-ha! There is no audiobook.

12:38.412 --> 12:39.473
- There is when Lupe reads it

12:39.573 --> 12:41.715
out loud to you
while you work out.

12:41.815 --> 12:43.837
- The metaphors were
a little heavy-handed.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.078
- You're ridiculous.

12:45.178 --> 12:46.719
- Usually, I sing to him.

12:46.819 --> 12:48.881
- Wait, are you wearing
a hemp shirt?

12:48.981 --> 12:50.082
- Yeah.
For every hemp shirt you buy,

12:50.182 --> 12:51.323
they send one to one
of those kids

12:51.423 --> 12:53.925
in...some country.

12:54.025 --> 12:55.246
I forget which.
One of the bad ones.

12:55.346 --> 12:57.088
- Hm.
Wearing a hemp shirt

12:57.188 --> 12:59.170
for a hot girl doesn't
make you a humanitarian.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.732
- Whoa, reducing women
to objects?

13:01.832 --> 13:03.053
Sarah--
- No, I--

13:03.153 --> 13:04.734
- I thought you were
better than that. Oh.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.836
- That's not--
that's not what I meant.

13:08.798 --> 13:10.800
- Wow, Sarah.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.502
- And then she said
if we work together,

13:13.602 --> 13:15.384
there's "more
where that came from,"

13:15.484 --> 13:17.545
and she gestured
to the asopao de pollo,

13:17.645 --> 13:21.549
but she also might've been,
like, indicating her...

13:21.649 --> 13:23.831
you know, her chest.

13:23.931 --> 13:26.593
- So gross of her
to barge in here and just--

13:26.693 --> 13:28.155
mmm, I didn't know
carrots could be buttery.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.476
- I'm sorry I didn't
believe you about her.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.277
- It's okay.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.039
I mean, it is baffling,
Sofía Salazar hitting on you.

13:33.139 --> 13:36.201
- Yeah, well,
I don't know about baffling.

13:36.301 --> 13:38.043
- So what are you gonna do?

13:38.143 --> 13:39.604
- I'ma lay down
some ground rules.

13:39.704 --> 13:41.446
If she can't follow 'em,
that's it. I'm out.

13:41.546 --> 13:42.887
You know, no amount
of money is worth that.

13:42.987 --> 13:44.529
- Amen. People like that,
they need to be called out

13:44.629 --> 13:46.891
on their behavior.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.212
Is that flan?
- I know, yeah. It's amazing.

13:48.312 --> 13:49.653
C'mon, get some of this.

13:49.753 --> 13:52.215
- And I think that although
Saanvi is my opposite,

13:52.315 --> 13:55.178
I do see myself in her,
or rather who I hope to be.

13:55.278 --> 13:58.100
A climate warrior
and a citizen of the world.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.102
- Climate warrior
with five cars.

14:00.202 --> 14:01.423
- Sarah, do you have
something to add?

14:01.523 --> 14:03.225
- Yeah, actually, I--
- I actually do.

14:03.325 --> 14:05.306
I read the book twice:
once to let it wash over me,

14:05.406 --> 14:06.507
a second time to really dig

14:06.607 --> 14:08.189
into why this book struck
a chord with me,

14:08.289 --> 14:09.590
and I really think
it's because--

14:09.690 --> 14:11.191
- Connor, when you say,
"citizen of the world,"

14:11.291 --> 14:12.673
is it because you went to Cabo

14:12.773 --> 14:14.314
for spring break
five years in a row?

14:14.414 --> 14:16.956
- It was six, but Sarah,
as white people,

14:17.056 --> 14:19.078
we need to cede the floor
to women of color.

14:19.178 --> 14:20.880
- When I was a child, I--
- That woman of color

14:20.980 --> 14:23.242
is my wife, and your allyship
is performative.

14:23.342 --> 14:25.043
[all gasp]

14:25.143 --> 14:26.324
- I also found a leitmotif.

14:26.424 --> 14:29.127
- Okay, why don't we all
just take a breath.

14:29.227 --> 14:30.928
- I'm sorry, there's just
a lot of toxic energy

14:31.028 --> 14:32.930
coming from this side
of the room.

14:33.030 --> 14:34.131
- Toxic?

14:34.231 --> 14:37.013
You don't get to decide
what's toxic.

14:37.113 --> 14:39.295
- Okay, no.
Violence is not okay.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.137
- I'm sorry.
May I put my arm around you?

14:41.237 --> 14:42.498
- You have my consent.
Thank you for asking.

14:42.598 --> 14:43.579
- Oh, my God.

14:43.679 --> 14:45.661
- Sarah, I think
you should leave.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.763
- [laughing]
I should leave--

14:51.646 --> 14:55.469
Okay. Yeah, fine. I'll go.

14:55.569 --> 14:59.192
Denise.

14:59.292 --> 15:01.995
Lulu?

15:02.095 --> 15:04.237
- Lulu.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.038
- Lulu.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.200
- Okay.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.302
[door slams]

15:11.903 --> 15:13.365
The leitmotif
I mentioned earlier

15:13.465 --> 15:15.286
refers to the author's
subtle use of darkness,

15:15.386 --> 15:17.688
which represents Saanvi's
almost impossible journey

15:17.788 --> 15:20.050
through an uncaring
capitalist society.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.412
[upbeat music]

15:22.512 --> 15:23.854
Yes!

15:23.954 --> 15:25.135
- You know, you could've done

15:25.235 --> 15:26.696
the moral support thing
from home.

15:26.796 --> 15:29.018
- You know I can't trust you
to actually confront someone.

15:29.118 --> 15:30.179
- Right,
like how I confronted you

15:30.279 --> 15:33.021
about not coming with me,
and here we are.

15:33.121 --> 15:34.743
- Don't worry. I'll hide.

15:34.843 --> 15:37.185
- Cool.

15:37.285 --> 15:38.466
Hello, Sofía.

15:38.566 --> 15:39.827
- Mm!

15:39.927 --> 15:42.229
Tom, are you in?

15:42.329 --> 15:44.191
- Actually, we're gonna have to
get some things straight first.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.993
- Okay, yeah.
- I can't work with you

15:46.093 --> 15:48.234
if you keep being so forward...

15:48.334 --> 15:50.356
[stuttering]
Sexually.

15:50.456 --> 15:52.678
- Oh, wow.

15:52.778 --> 15:54.720
- Yeah, we're gonna have to set
some ground rules.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.362
Number one--sorry, A.

15:57.462 --> 15:59.484
I lettered them
for some reason. A--

15:59.584 --> 16:02.487
- Tom, Tom, please. I'm sorry.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.448
It was a misunderstanding,
but yeah,

16:04.548 --> 16:06.870
I was playing the part
of Sofía Salazar.

16:08.231 --> 16:11.014
- Are you not Sofía Salazar?

16:11.114 --> 16:13.056
- I was doing the whole
"hot in the kitchen" shtick

16:13.156 --> 16:15.017
to get you excited
to write the book.

16:15.117 --> 16:17.419
I's what everyone
expects of me.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.021
And obviously, I overdid it

16:19.121 --> 16:22.224
and I made you uncomfortable,
and I am so sorry.

16:22.324 --> 16:24.265
To both of you.

16:24.365 --> 16:26.988
- Hola.
- She's my ride.

16:27.088 --> 16:28.869
- And I actually get
what you're saying.

16:28.969 --> 16:30.150
There's no winning.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.512
Do you know how many times
I've been told

16:31.612 --> 16:32.913
that I don't seem
Latina enough?

16:33.013 --> 16:34.594
- Exactamente.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.036
It's like, how dare
they tell us who we are?

16:37.136 --> 16:39.879
- Maybe this memoir can finally
show the world the real you.

16:39.979 --> 16:41.240
- I love that.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.401
- This calls for some
croquetas de pollo.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.884
[both speaking Spanish]

16:45.984 --> 16:47.846
- You said I couldn't
get confrontational.

16:47.946 --> 16:50.648
I said, you said
I couldn't be confrontational.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.369
Sorry, go on, go on.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.490
- I'm sorry for ruining
book club,

16:53.590 --> 16:54.611
but we can find a better one.

16:54.711 --> 16:55.892
- No, we can't.
- No, we can't.

16:55.992 --> 16:58.375
- I'm not the one you need
to be apologizing to.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.697
I mean, I'm one of them, but...

17:00.797 --> 17:02.058
you need to be happy
for Connor.

17:02.158 --> 17:04.300
He's dating, which is huge.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.340
And he's trying
to be progressive,

17:05.440 --> 17:06.822
which is what we want.

17:06.922 --> 17:10.145
- Look, of course I can be
happy for Connor, but...

17:10.245 --> 17:12.146
- Is it because you're
uncomfortable with him

17:12.246 --> 17:13.708
being on the same side as you?

17:13.808 --> 17:15.069
'Cause he's taking
the moral high ground,

17:15.169 --> 17:16.270
and that's where
you like to hang out?

17:16.370 --> 17:18.472
- [laughing]
Oh.

17:18.572 --> 17:22.275
You think that I need
to feel superior to Connor?

17:22.375 --> 17:26.539
That is not--I just--I don't--

17:27.900 --> 17:28.921
Don't just keep staring at me

17:29.021 --> 17:30.162
when you know
that you're right.

17:30.262 --> 17:32.524
- But that's the best part.

17:32.624 --> 17:36.367
- Salud.
- Salud!

17:36.467 --> 17:37.848
Truth is,
we really need the money.

17:37.948 --> 17:41.331
- Well, now you are
in the Sofía Salazar business.

17:41.431 --> 17:42.813
- Cha-ching.
[laughter]

17:42.913 --> 17:44.374
- It's kinda funny, actually,

17:44.474 --> 17:46.456
the idea that I would
throw myself at Tom.

17:46.556 --> 17:47.737
- That's what I was
telling him.

17:47.837 --> 17:48.778
- I don't know
if it's that funny.

17:48.878 --> 17:50.459
- Well, I date
a certain kind of guy,

17:50.559 --> 17:52.621
and Tom over here is not it.

17:52.721 --> 17:55.664
I have a weakness
for athletic jock types.

17:55.764 --> 17:56.865
- Okay, well--

17:56.965 --> 17:58.546
- I was on
the high school diving team.

17:58.646 --> 17:59.787
- I'm picturing it right now.

17:59.887 --> 18:01.749
You and me out on the town,

18:01.849 --> 18:03.710
and the paparazzi
are screaming,

18:03.810 --> 18:05.992
"Hey, Sofía,
when did you start dating

18:06.092 --> 18:09.836
that inflatable guy
at a car dealership?"

18:09.936 --> 18:11.757
- Okay, alright, okay.
That's enough.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.279
- You don't have to--
- Mm.

18:13.379 --> 18:16.081
Listen, I make jokes about
my husband, okay, not you.

18:16.181 --> 18:17.442
You would be lucky
to be with someone

18:17.542 --> 18:19.284
as smart, thoughtful,
and hot as Tom.

18:19.384 --> 18:22.807
He does things, wild things,
to me, every night.

18:22.907 --> 18:24.568
- That's somewhat generous.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.210
- And the pomegranate seeds
in the guacamole,

18:26.310 --> 18:28.311
yeah, there delicious,
but they're inauthentic.

18:29.633 --> 18:32.615
- Oh.

18:32.715 --> 18:34.177
I love her.
[laughs]

18:34.277 --> 18:35.658
I love you.

18:35.758 --> 18:38.100
I am gonna name
a dish after you.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.423
You know what? Pascal!
Rip up the menu, okay?

18:41.523 --> 18:44.505
I am going to name a dish
after the skinny man's wife.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.387
- I didn't like her
hitting on me, but I'm not sure

18:46.487 --> 18:48.749
I'm crazy about "inflatable guy
at a car dealership."

18:48.849 --> 18:50.310
- You better write
this book fast.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.272
- Well, it can actually
be a process, so--

18:52.372 --> 18:54.354
I will write like the wind.

18:54.454 --> 18:56.275
- Connor?

18:56.375 --> 18:57.717
Oh, good, you're both here.

18:57.817 --> 18:58.878
I just wanted to come over

18:58.978 --> 19:00.279
and say, "I'm sorry,
I was a jerk,"

19:00.379 --> 19:02.721
so I'm sorry.

19:02.821 --> 19:03.722
I was a jerk.

19:03.822 --> 19:06.925
That craziness at book club,

19:07.025 --> 19:08.726
I was just thrown
by you two dating,

19:08.826 --> 19:09.967
but that is totally on me.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.649
You two make a great couple.

19:11.749 --> 19:15.732
- Actually, we just decided
to stop seeing each other.

19:15.832 --> 19:17.374
- Oh, no, what?
- It's probably for the best.

19:17.474 --> 19:18.775
- No, no, but you've got

19:18.875 --> 19:20.016
something really good
going on here.

19:20.116 --> 19:21.337
I mean, Lindsay,
you're opening up my brother

19:21.437 --> 19:23.819
to such new ways of thinking,
and Connor,

19:23.919 --> 19:24.940
I'm sure you're
helping out Lindsay

19:25.040 --> 19:27.042
in some way too.

19:27.762 --> 19:28.983
- Bye, Connor.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.144
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:30.244 --> 19:32.907
- Bye, Lindsay.

19:33.007 --> 19:34.508
Oh, my God, what happened?

19:34.608 --> 19:36.150
- She just said
I was trying too hard

19:36.250 --> 19:37.951
to connect to her,
and it freaked her out.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.193
- Reading one book
and buying a hemp shirt,

19:40.293 --> 19:41.754
that's not trying too hard.

19:41.854 --> 19:44.317
- I also bought her an 8% stake
in a Canadian wind farm.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.038
- Yeah, that's hard.

19:46.138 --> 19:48.360
- She's just the first woman
I've been with since Emily,

19:48.460 --> 19:51.323
so I was just trying so hard
not to make the same mistakes

19:51.423 --> 19:54.205
and be so competitive,
but I overcorrected.

19:54.305 --> 19:57.007
I think I just held on
a little too tight.

19:57.107 --> 19:58.489
But on the bright side,

19:58.589 --> 20:00.571
I don't have to drink
this kombucha stuff anymore.

20:00.671 --> 20:03.453
I mean, it literally tastes
like fermented tea.

20:03.553 --> 20:05.455
- That's exactly what it is.

20:05.555 --> 20:07.777
Look, it must be impossible
to date after so long.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.659
I mean, I would be a mess.

20:10.759 --> 20:12.661
- Yeah, you'd be like
a lesbian Hindenburg.

20:12.761 --> 20:13.822
- [laughs]

20:13.922 --> 20:15.343
And I know
that it's not the same,

20:15.443 --> 20:18.426
but you're always invited
to our place for movie night.

20:18.526 --> 20:20.508
And I'm really glad
that you're, you know,

20:20.608 --> 20:22.790
trying to be more enlightened.

20:22.890 --> 20:23.870
Oh, that should really
be recycled.

20:23.970 --> 20:25.472
- You know, it's not easy

20:25.572 --> 20:27.594
caring so much
about everything,

20:27.694 --> 20:31.397
keeping all that
ethical stuff straight.

20:31.497 --> 20:35.560
I-I-I really admire your...you.

20:35.660 --> 20:36.842
I really--I admire you.

20:36.942 --> 20:38.763
- [laughs]

20:38.863 --> 20:41.005
Thank you. Come here.

20:41.105 --> 20:43.848
[laughs]

20:43.948 --> 20:45.689
- How bad do you wanna
throw that in the recycling?

20:45.789 --> 20:47.791
- It's literally all
I can think about.

20:48.471 --> 20:50.013
[sweeping music]

20:50.113 --> 20:53.256
- I'm so glad
Carol got to live her truth.

20:53.356 --> 20:55.838
Also, that sex scene between
those two ladies was sick!

20:57.519 --> 21:00.422
- And he's back.
- Yep.

21:00.522 --> 21:02.944
You know, I'm glad that we're
taking a break from book club.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.226
- Yeah.

21:05.326 --> 21:06.907
- We're allowed to go
to the next one though, right?

21:07.007 --> 21:08.068
- The one after that.
- Oh, cool.

21:08.168 --> 21:10.310
- And ultimately,
I think the novel

21:10.410 --> 21:14.434
is a thrilling indictment
on late-stage capitalism.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.516
- Lindsay, I'm going to say
what we're all thinking.

21:17.616 --> 21:21.360
800 pages to tell me this lady
feels bad that she's rich?

21:21.460 --> 21:22.681
Please.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.783
[applause]
Huh?
