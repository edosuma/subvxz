- Previously on
"Good Girls..."

00:08.138 --> 00:08.530
- Did you remove a pen cap
from the evidence locker?

00:09.270 --> 00:10.271
- I failed.
It's over.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.099
- I tried to seduce
my therapist.

00:13.709 --> 00:14.014
He straight-up rejected me.
- You've missed two sessions.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.103
- There's no point, okay?
I made it weird.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.669
- If you don't come back,

00:17.713 --> 00:19.454
I've got to fill your spot.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.673
- There's been a bit
of a snafu.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.198
- You don't say.
- What if I made it up to you?

00:24.241 --> 00:25.677
Not him but you.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.201
- That'd be a huge order.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.767
- You draw it?

00:28.811 --> 00:30.726
- We make an engraver's plate
and print it all on site.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.075
- Cool.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.208
- You cannot
finish that plate.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.166
- He said he'd let me go--
- He won't.

00:36.210 --> 00:39.343
Wait, you need us.
You need all of us.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.779
- Not all of you.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.351
- Have you heard from Lucy?
- I'm sure she's fine.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.496

ourselves.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.749

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
- I couldn't leave it there.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.796
- Why not?
- Her phone was ringing.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.625
Someone would notice
something horrible happened.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.584
- Something horrible
did happen.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.761
- And we just stood there
and watched.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.201
- I didn't watch.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.943
- Honestly, neither did I.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.641
- I did.

Saw the whole thing.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.169

02:25.362 --> 02:27.451

02:30.237 --> 02:31.455
- No way.
- Wow.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.630
- Neato.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.642
- Let me just drop my bag.

- Uh, Dorothy
wants to see you.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.738

- In the back.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.329
- Is everything okay?

03:19.373 --> 03:21.636
- She's the one

03:23.507 --> 03:25.944
- I wouldn't say we're
best friends, exactly.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.729

03:27.772 --> 03:31.472
- Sisters more like.
- Mmm.

03:31.515 --> 03:34.910
She's just the sweetest
little thing.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.521
I wish there was
something I could do.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.262
- You could head
our media coverage.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.351
- Consider it done.
- Like, start a hotline.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.701
- I could print
beautiful posters.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.356
Oh, do they still do those
adorable pictures

03:46.400 --> 03:47.879
on milk cartons?
- Okay--

03:47.923 --> 03:49.359
- Who will lead the air search,
Officer?

03:49.403 --> 03:50.795
- Pump the brakes, folks.

03:50.839 --> 03:53.537
We really can't do much
till it's been 72 hours.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.756
Now where'd you last see her?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.584
- We worked together
the other night.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.326
- Anything unusual?
- No.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.719
I left,
and she stayed and locked up.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.504
- Well, no more of that.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.419
- What do you mean?

04:05.462 --> 04:09.423
- Well, I'm closing early
till we get some answers.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.076
- Well, how will we
work nights?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.774
- We're not, sweetie.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.255
Mm.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.998
- What about everything that
was in her fridge

04:20.042 --> 04:22.000
or, like, her laundry
that was in the dryer.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.786
I mean,
does someone fold that now,

04:24.829 --> 04:28.833
or does it all just end up
in trash bag out on the curb?

04:28.877 --> 04:31.575
- Well, how are you all
related again?

04:31.619 --> 04:34.883
- She was someone
my sister worked with.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.407
- I meant Gregg and Nancy.

04:37.451 --> 04:41.324
- I wrecked their marriage.
- Ah, that's right.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.586
And what about, like,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.501
her Instagram?

04:44.545 --> 04:46.634
Or any of her social media?

04:46.677 --> 04:50.942
Just frozen in time now
like those clocks at Chernobyl.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.466
She had this lipstick.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
She never even opened it.

04:54.468 --> 04:57.384
Like, it was from France
or something.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.603
I mean it must've cost her
like half her paycheck.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.083
You know?

05:01.126 --> 05:03.128
It's like a Cinderella level
lip scenario.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.652
You can tell that she thought

05:04.695 --> 05:07.045
she was really going somewhere
special with it,

05:07.089 --> 05:10.788
but instead
she just went poof.

05:13.574 --> 05:16.881
- Can I ask you something?
- Please.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.973
Are you wearing perfume?
- Excuse me?

05:22.017 --> 05:24.715
- I'm smelling
something floral.

05:24.759 --> 05:25.977
- Uh...

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
- From the moment
you sat down--

05:27.544 --> 05:29.633
- I don't wear perfume.

05:29.677 --> 05:33.376
- Body wash?
- Just plain soap.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.943
- Hm.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.992
- So I guess what
I really want to know is...

05:42.733 --> 05:45.519
When do I stop seeing it
in my brain?

05:45.562 --> 05:49.479
- Any lotions
or fabric softeners?

05:49.523 --> 05:51.089
- Are you being serious?

05:51.133 --> 05:53.483
- Sometimes the boxes
for scented and unscented

05:53.527 --> 05:54.963
look the same.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
- Someone died.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.404
- I wanna help you.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.406
- Thank you.

06:03.450 --> 06:07.541
- For that to work, I need
complete and total honesty.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.631
- Okay.
- Let's start over.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.546
- Great.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.593
- Are you wearing perfume?

06:24.993 --> 06:27.822
- It's not fair!
- That's how you play.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.476
- Last game.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.912
Heads hit pillows in ten.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.696
- Uno!

06:32.740 --> 06:35.786
- Uh, you got two cards.
- So?

06:35.830 --> 06:37.962
- "Uno" means one, dummy.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.790
- Remember when we thought
the age difference

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
would help them get along?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.925
- My suspension
is up for review.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
- How?

06:47.581 --> 06:50.235
- Uh, maybe with Turner gone,
the D.A. doesn't have enough.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.846
- So what's it mean?

06:51.889 --> 06:53.935
- They might give me
my badge back.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.024
- Do you want it back?

06:57.765 --> 07:00.028
- You're gonna be a cop again,
Daddy?

07:01.595 --> 07:05.686
- Well, they gotta talk to
Mommy and me about it first.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.601
- Why do they wanna talk to me?

07:09.037 --> 07:11.996
- Not about egg roll.
- Then what's it about?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.477
- Mm-mm-mm.
Making me look good.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.524
All right, chop chop.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.163
- I don't have it.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.775
- Really?
Again?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.561
- I don't know what to say.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.258
I don't have it.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.259
- She was a good person.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.089
- Seemed like
a really sweet girl.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.178
- You didn't have to do it.
- Kinda did.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.050
- She never would've
said anything.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.269
- Rotten egg's a rotten egg.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.620
It's just business, darling.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.579
- Well, now you've screwed
your entire enterprise.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.060
- Oh yeah?
How's that?

09:00.365 --> 09:03.020
- Her boyfriend,

09:03.064 --> 09:07.372
who is also a very good
person, by the way...

09:07.416 --> 09:11.028
is beside himself
and has called the cops.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.813
- Mmm.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.597
- Yeah.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.643
And he's got the woman who
owns this place so freaked out

09:16.686 --> 09:20.864
she's got it on lockdown, so...

09:20.908 --> 09:23.127
great job, Mr. CFO!

09:31.048 --> 09:33.573
So who's the boyfriend?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.185
- Why?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.796
- 'Cause he's gonna need
an address.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.234
- No.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.975
- We gotta get
back up and running.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.368
I got my own debts to pay,
all right?

09:46.411 --> 09:48.109
- No!

09:48.152 --> 09:51.068
- Oh, you still think
you get a say in this, huh?

09:51.112 --> 09:53.941
Nah, see that ship sailed when
you put three slugs in me.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.290
- This is your fault!

09:55.333 --> 09:58.772
- You, me, we?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.817
It's just business.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.842
- I'll print.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.153
- But what happened?
I thought you were on lockdown?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.287
- I'll find a way.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.335
- Gee, thanks.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.424
That'll make it easier
on everybody.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.401
- Are you sure this is hers?
- It was in her purse.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.360
- One, two, three, four?
- Nope.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.318
- What's her birthday?
- I have no idea.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.842
- Four, three, two, one.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.366
- What's Au Jus's birthday?
- Oh, like I'd know that.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.934
- And I'm locked out again.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.326
- What were you gonna text him
anyway?

11:15.370 --> 11:16.588
- I don't know, like,

11:16.632 --> 11:18.242
"I need space,
and so I left town."

11:18.286 --> 11:20.810
- Oh, like a "Eat Pray Love"
situation?

11:20.854 --> 11:23.204
- Ooh, that's good.
I'm mean, it's, like--

11:23.247 --> 11:25.728
It's like he's been smothering
me and loving me too hard

11:25.772 --> 11:28.339
and maybe I wanna buy
my own tampons for a change.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.819
- Hey, hold up.
He's buying you tampons now?

11:29.863 --> 11:31.342
- Not me.
Lucy.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.822
- She's gonna dump his ass

11:32.866 --> 11:35.259
so he calls off the cops
before they go all CSI.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.306
- It's kinda harsh.
- Yeah, better than kinda dead.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.308
- I'm sorry,
why did you think

11:40.351 --> 11:41.788
we were trying
to break in to the phone?

11:42.745 --> 11:44.791
- For everything
you guys just said,

11:44.834 --> 11:47.794
just I thought we were gonna
slide into his DMs.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.534
Oh, hello!

11:49.578 --> 11:51.014
What's the
boyfriend's birthday?

11:51.058 --> 11:53.364
- How would I know that?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.236
- Don't you wanna ask the bird?
- Okay.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.541
I'm just trying
to be a team player

11:56.585 --> 11:57.847
and get in to that phone.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.631
- Okay, well there's
a million possibilities,

11:59.675 --> 12:01.372
and we're never
gonna guess it.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.769
- It's the new one.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.423
- So?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.818
- What?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.734
-  There's another
way to get in.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.573
Want some?

12:28.617 --> 12:29.966
- I'm good.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.359
- Mmm.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.534
Can I get some more
bronco sauce?

12:32.577 --> 12:33.709
- Yeah, one sec.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.411
- So...

12:44.372 --> 12:45.982
- Can you get it?

12:49.812 --> 12:52.423
- She's not in one piece.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.821
- I don't need all of her.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.304
- What do you need?

13:06.089 --> 13:09.658
- I just need her face.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.009
- Bronco sauce.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.320
- You still owe me
for the last favor.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.887
- I expected you would
bring that up,

13:20.930 --> 13:24.629
so I thought I would triple
your invitation order.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.720
How you gonna do that?

13:28.764 --> 13:30.679
You can't even make
your regular delivery.

13:30.722 --> 13:31.985
- Exactly.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.335
It's a vicious cycle,
don't you see?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.467
I can't help you
if you don't help me.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.777
- Or...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.126
- Or?

13:43.170 --> 13:45.781
- You can give me something
I know you got.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.918
It's been on my mind
for a while now.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.793
- What's that?

13:57.837 --> 14:01.014
Your husband won't like it.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.017
- I have herpes.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.416
- I want a hot tub.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.422
- Oh.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.861
- You say your prayers?

14:21.904 --> 14:24.733
- In my head!
- That works.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.915
What is that, sir?

14:32.959 --> 14:36.005
- Nothing.
- That better not be my phone.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.748
- I've been to hell and back
looking for that thing.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.532
Give it to me.
- One more game!

14:41.576 --> 14:43.056
- Better give me that phone

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
before I "one more game" you.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.408
Go to sleep.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.896
Good night.
- Mmm, how's this gonna work?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.683
- How's what gonna work?

15:01.726 --> 15:03.641
- How's Daddy supposed to be
a cop again?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.427
- What do you mean?

15:07.994 --> 15:09.909
- He'll have to arrest you.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.696
I mean, right?
Like, at some point.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.135
- Don't forget to floss.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.889
- Hey, do you have a second?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.109
- He won't eat.
- Since when?

15:36.152 --> 15:38.111
- The kids said
he stopped singing.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.764
Come on, Dorito.
Come on, lick it.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.636
Come here, lick it.
Lick it for dada.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.203
- How long does it take
to get a hot tub?

15:45.640 --> 15:50.036
- Um, um, depends on the model
and the upgrades?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.647
- Is there, like, a floor model
you could get right away?

15:52.690 --> 15:55.737
- He's just not himself.
What if he is sick?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.262
- I need your help.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.829
- I can't watch
another thing die.

16:00.872 --> 16:01.961
- Dean.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.964
Neither can I.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.098
- How many does this one hold?

16:11.013 --> 16:12.797
- Um, that particular brand

16:12.841 --> 16:14.843
has four
contoured lounge seats.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.802
- But, how many people
can you fit?

16:17.846 --> 16:21.545
- I guess that would depend
on you.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.156
- Okay.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.855
Yeah, I'm also gonna need
that laser filtration.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.990
- Ooh, that's a much bigger
price point.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.519
- Is that a problem?

16:44.177 --> 16:46.309
- Welcome to
the Four Star family.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.181
- Hmm.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.879
Whoo!
All right.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.315
Let's do this.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.014
- Well, I--
I just have to transmit this.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.190
It's gonna just take me a--

16:57.233 --> 16:58.887
Not this.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.629
That.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.066
- Now?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.122
- Uh-uh.
- What?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.211
- Too dark, too quiet,

17:18.254 --> 17:20.735
too perfect a place
to kill some suckers.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.693
- Man, why you gotta
put that in my head?

17:22.737 --> 17:24.043
- Because unfortunately,

17:24.086 --> 17:25.870
I've been in way too many
of these situations,

17:25.914 --> 17:27.611
and now I know
what to look for.

17:27.655 --> 17:31.702
Following a murderer
two hours through cornfields

17:31.746 --> 17:33.878
in the middle of the night?
- Cool it.

17:40.102 --> 17:43.105
- I'm sorry,
what more did you need to see?

17:45.325 --> 17:47.805
- Just that.
Drive.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.720
- He's not gonna kill us.

17:49.764 --> 17:53.072
He knows Dean's not putting in
the order till we get back.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.990
You should've seen his face.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.080
He really wants a hot tub.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.135
Which one is it?

18:17.313 --> 18:19.098
- I didn't bury her.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.638
- How many fresh ones left?

18:38.465 --> 18:39.640
- Two more.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.337
- I can't do another one.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.818
- This is the one.
I can feel it.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.171
Hey.
We need the light.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.696
- Sorry, we've got that
review thing tomorrow.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.438
Stan doesn't know what to wear.
- What are you gonna say?

18:55.482 --> 18:56.744
- I don't know.
Suit?

18:58.528 --> 19:00.182
- I mean, do the police
review people or whatever?

19:00.226 --> 19:02.358
- He's wanted to be a cop
since third grade.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.361
He'd still be one
if it wasn't for me.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.581
- So you go in there,
and you make it right.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.278
- What happens the next time
he has to cover

19:09.322 --> 19:10.888
for my criminal ass?

19:10.932 --> 19:13.500
- It'll be more than probation.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.806
- Well, maybe there won't be
a next time.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.765
- We're digging up
the body of a girl

19:17.808 --> 19:21.160
who would still be singing to
her bird if she hadn't met us.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
- There'll be a next time.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.427
He doesn't wanna wear a suit.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.736
- You know he can't
be a cop again?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.173
You know that, right?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.306
- What am I gonna do?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.266
- Yo.
Gimme some more light.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.408
- They're hers.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.761
Ugh.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.768
- We're gonna have to
uncover her face.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.937
- Give me a wet wipe.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.300
Give me another one.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.009
Give me her phone.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.720
We're in.

21:26.763 --> 21:27.764
- Oh, God.

21:35.903 --> 21:39.341
- I'm gonna tell Stan to wear
a sweater and khakis.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.039
- Always classy.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.747
- It's a tumor.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.970
- What?
- Stage IV.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.798
- What are you talking about?

22:01.842 --> 22:03.931
- He's got a hard, hot lump
right where he poops.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.934
You can feel it.
- I'm not doing that.

22:06.977 --> 22:10.503
- Wing MD says it could be
a feather cyst,

22:10.546 --> 22:13.114
but the Beak Brothers, they
have this YouTube channel--

22:13.157 --> 22:14.985
- Why don't we make
an appointment with a vet

22:15.029 --> 22:16.639
instead of YouTube?

22:16.683 --> 22:18.598
- There's only, like, one
avian guy in all of Detroit.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.687
- Make an appointment.

22:20.730 --> 22:23.037
- Just gonna say chemo.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.822
It's probably a lot more
expensive than human chemo.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.698
Little guy's a goner.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.701
- What did you say?

22:35.789 --> 22:37.747
- He's toast. Dunzo.
It's over.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.401
- That's not gonna happen.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.837
- It's like we're built
on an Indian burial ground

22:40.881 --> 22:42.491
or something.
- Look at me.

22:42.535 --> 22:45.494
- I'm officially cursed.
- Dean.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.496
- What?
- I will get the money.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.411
How?

22:49.455 --> 22:53.894
- If I have to rob every bank
in the city, I will do it.

22:53.937 --> 22:57.027
This bird is gonna make it.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.682
- Oh--okay.
- Dorito can't die.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.032
- I'll make an appointment.
- Thank you.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.824
- It's okay.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.568
- It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

23:16.830 --> 23:19.876
- I read that the human body
starts decomposing

23:19.920 --> 23:21.704
within a matter of minutes.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.012
Like, one second your this

23:25.055 --> 23:29.712
grape, all juicy and plump...

23:29.756 --> 23:33.586
and the next you're just
a shriveled up raisin.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.631
- Mm-hmm.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.155
- I can't get away from it.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.159
- Ever tried to talk to her?

23:42.899 --> 23:43.944
- Who?

23:43.987 --> 23:45.467
- The face you keep seeing.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.035
- She's...

23:48.078 --> 23:49.036
dead.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.124
- She ever talk to you?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.647
- Again--

23:51.691 --> 23:54.171
- What other faces do you see?

23:56.260 --> 23:58.698
This isn't like a, uh,

23:58.741 --> 24:01.570
like "Sixth Sense" thing,
if that's what you're--

24:01.614 --> 24:03.485
- I don't think you're talking
to dead people, Annie.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.748
- Oh.
Good.

24:05.792 --> 24:09.230
- Hallucinatory psychosis
can present for many reasons.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.189
Let me ask you a question.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.800
- Can't wait.

24:14.714 --> 24:18.805
- Is the face in the room
with us right now?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.246
- What's the last thing
he texted?

24:25.289 --> 24:27.553
- "Where are you?
Please call me.

24:27.596 --> 24:30.773
I'm worried."
There's a whole lot of those.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.732
- Before that.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.082
- "I'm scared you're dead."

24:38.868 --> 24:40.217
- Before that.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.003
- "Toppings for taco night."

24:43.046 --> 24:44.700
- What did they choose?

24:44.744 --> 24:46.180
The usual:
cheese, lettuce, tomato.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.139
- Hard or soft shell?
- No one chooses soft.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.272
- Yeah, they do.
Flour or corn?

24:51.315 --> 24:52.665
- They do not.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.101
- They do bowls too,
with rice.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.582
- Then it ain't really
taco night is it?

24:56.625 --> 24:58.148
- And what would you call it?
- Mexican food.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.847
- All right,
let's get this over with.

25:00.890 --> 25:04.154
"I'm sorry it's taken so long
to get back to you...

25:04.198 --> 25:05.547
but I needed some time--"

25:05.591 --> 25:06.896
- No, you can't say that.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.594
He's gonna think
she's coming back.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.074
- Right.

25:13.076 --> 25:16.645
"I'm not in a place...

25:16.689 --> 25:18.255
to be in a relationship
right now."

25:18.299 --> 25:19.953
- That's good.
That's good.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.998
- Yeah, say the
"it's not you, it's me" thing.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.217
- No one says that.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.088
- Everyone says that.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.960
- "It's not your fault..."

25:27.003 --> 25:30.746
- AKA, it's not you, it's me.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.358
- "And..."

25:34.402 --> 25:36.186
- Just do it.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.275
We're saving his life.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.929
- Jugular.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.588
- "I'm not in love with you
anymore."

25:46.632 --> 25:48.024
- Shrug emoji.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.069
- No.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.113
- Broken heart emoji.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
- Why do I need an emoji?

25:51.898 --> 25:53.639
- It lessens the blow.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.031
- Oh, to the moon
with a smiley face,

25:55.075 --> 25:57.207
like "good night,
good-bye, it's over."

25:57.251 --> 25:59.993
- Fine.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.605
- Now what?

26:03.649 --> 26:05.128
- We wait and see
if he buys it.

26:06.913 --> 26:10.220
- Bubbles.
- Wow, he really misses her.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.309
- Oh, they went away.
- They're back.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.703
- What's it say?

26:14.747 --> 26:16.705
- "I think we should
have this conversation

26:16.749 --> 26:18.054
face-to-face."

26:18.098 --> 26:19.229
- Oh, no.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.884
- Say she's out of town.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.320
- Bubbles.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.889
"Don't be mad."

26:26.933 --> 26:29.239
Why would I be mad?
I mean, Lucy.

26:31.415 --> 26:32.982
- Bubbles.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.903
- "I used Find My Phone.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.819
I know you're at
your friend's house."

26:52.132 --> 26:54.264
- Turn it off.
- Now?

26:55.570 --> 26:56.136
What does that do?
- Give me the SIM card.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.007
- Why?
- So I can smash it.

26:58.747 --> 26:59.922
- So this is
the last known location?

27:01.445 --> 27:02.272
- Okay, so what are we gonna do
when he shows up here?

27:02.316 --> 27:04.013
Tell him she's napping?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.754
- It's not the worst idea
you've ever had.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.714
- Yeah, it is.
- Might buy us a night.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.978
- What are you doing?

27:12.021 --> 27:14.284
- Beth.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.156
- What'd you say?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.200
- To come over.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.246
- Why would you say that?

27:19.289 --> 27:22.162
- Because at this point,
it is either him or the cops!

27:22.205 --> 27:23.816
- I'm sorry, but this is
definitely the worst idea

27:23.859 --> 27:25.687
any of us have ever had.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.776
- What could we possibly
tell that child right now?

27:32.433 --> 27:34.174
- That she's gone.

27:44.271 --> 27:47.927
- Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate your time.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.453
- How'd it go?

27:52.496 --> 27:54.934
- We'll see.
You're up next, baby.

27:54.977 --> 27:57.284
- I'm gonna be frank with you,
Mrs. Hill.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.981
Although he was never
formally charged,

27:59.025 --> 28:00.896
you can understand
we have a few reservations

28:00.940 --> 28:02.724
about reinstating him.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.726
- Right.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.119
- The department
had reason to believe

28:06.162 --> 28:07.990
that your husband
was compromised

28:08.034 --> 28:09.992
by some kind of
outside influence.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.953
- Can I get a glass of water?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.192
Quick top off.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.247
- We're ready when you are.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.252
Has your family experienced
any kind of financial hardship

28:52.295 --> 28:54.733
since Mr. Hill's probation?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.125
- What does that
have to do with anything?

28:56.169 --> 28:58.214
- Can be a risk factor.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.828
We've got it pretty bad.

29:02.871 --> 29:05.482
- Do you feel your husband's
under a lot of pressure

29:05.526 --> 29:07.223
because of it?

29:07.267 --> 29:09.225
- I mean, I don't know if
you've ever been in a situation

29:09.269 --> 29:11.532
where you can't pay your bills.

29:11.575 --> 29:15.057
Add to that
two tiny mouths to feed.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.059
It's a pressure
you can't imagine.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.758
- How do you both
manage that stress?

29:25.938 --> 29:28.375
- We...

29:28.418 --> 29:30.899
dream about robbing banks.

29:30.943 --> 29:34.033
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, plan the whole thing:

29:34.076 --> 29:38.167
which banks, disguises,
hostage negotiations.

29:38.211 --> 29:41.910
Stan being a cop,
he knows all the tricks.

29:41.954 --> 29:45.784
And don't get me wrong,
it's not just banks--

29:45.827 --> 29:48.177
jewelry stores, art galleries,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.179
we wouldn't even rule out
a home invasion

29:50.223 --> 29:53.835
if, you know,
it was the right zip code.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.184
- What's kept you
from doing it?

29:55.228 --> 29:57.317
- Nothing.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.406
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.542
The problem is, um...

30:09.503 --> 30:12.288
he would lock me up
and throw away the key.

30:15.030 --> 30:18.164
Let me tell you something
about my husband.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.166
This is a man
who let Richie Green

30:20.209 --> 30:22.864
copy off his geometry test
in ninth grade

30:22.908 --> 30:24.605
and is still sick about it.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.347
It haunts him.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.132
When they're giving out
free samples at Costco,

30:30.176 --> 30:31.960
he takes one,

30:32.004 --> 30:35.094
even if no one is looking.

30:35.137 --> 30:38.837
He couldn't commit a crime
if his life depended on it.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.449
And if you knew him,

30:42.492 --> 30:46.888
you wouldn't question
his moral fitness.

30:46.932 --> 30:47.933
Hell, you wouldn't have
suspended him

30:47.976 --> 30:49.978
in the first place.

30:50.022 --> 30:53.590
Because Stanley Lamont Hill
is a cop

30:53.634 --> 30:56.506
whether you give him a badge
or not.

30:59.466 --> 31:03.252
So...

31:03.296 --> 31:05.472
if there's nothing else,

31:05.515 --> 31:07.517
I have nails to paint.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.091
- Thank you
for your candor.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.132
- Is she here?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.920
I just wanna see Lucy--
Lucy!

32:01.963 --> 32:03.138
Lucy!
Lulu!

32:03.182 --> 32:05.053
- She's not here.

32:09.231 --> 32:10.972
Why don't you sit?

32:19.502 --> 32:21.243
- So where is she?

32:31.297 --> 32:33.038
- I don't know.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.301
- She just texted me
this morning.

32:39.348 --> 32:43.352
- And then I drove her right to
the airport after that.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.963
- She left?

33:01.196 --> 33:03.285
Have you ever been dumped?

33:06.636 --> 33:09.074
- I married
my first boyfriend.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.124
- Then you don't know.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.352
You want it?

33:29.790 --> 33:31.705
- Sure.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.026
- Arizona.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.506
- Huh.

34:06.348 --> 34:09.090
- ♪ Ooh

34:10.526 --> 34:13.268
♪ Ooh

34:15.270 --> 34:18.143
♪ Ooh

34:34.724 --> 34:36.770
- Why do all shrinks suck?

34:37.640 --> 34:39.294
- Here's another five star.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.948
"I found Dr. Sears
on Groupon..."

34:40.991 --> 34:43.168
- Next.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.908
- Kay.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.606
This one has three stars.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.477
First session is free.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.696
- Hmm, me likey.

34:49.739 --> 34:50.697
- Uh-oh.

34:50.740 --> 34:53.003
- What?

34:53.047 --> 34:54.657
- Someone says
his couch pulls out.

34:55.745 --> 34:56.833
How far away, though?

34:56.877 --> 34:58.313
- No!

34:58.357 --> 35:00.663
- Fine.
Next.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.709
- This guy seems cool.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.928
- How many reviews?

35:04.972 --> 35:06.539
- Pages.

35:06.582 --> 35:07.844
- I'm listening.

35:07.888 --> 35:10.934
- "Sense of humor..."
- Love.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.675
- "Feel like he cares."

35:12.719 --> 35:15.243
"Great with difficult
personalities."

35:15.287 --> 35:17.376
- Okay.
Hit me.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.900
- 2.2 miles away.
- Done and done.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.641
- Dr. Josh Cohen.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.514
- No.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.255
You don't mind, right?

35:32.042 --> 35:34.567
- Just, uh--
just a moment, Tim.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.488
I wanna come back.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.446
- Window's closed.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.883
But I've seen, like,
every therapist in Detroit.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.058
- That can't be true.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.539
- Fine.
Two.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.714
- There are others.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.281
I can refer you.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.892
You can waste their time.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.242
- What is wrong with you?

35:57.285 --> 35:58.852
- You quit me.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.680
- Yeah, and now
I'm trying to un-quit you.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.377
- Already gave away
your session.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.900
- You're the worst.
- Excuse me?

36:03.944 --> 36:05.293
- How are you not
gonna help someone

36:05.337 --> 36:06.425
who is standing in front of you

36:06.468 --> 36:07.687
literally begging
for your help?

36:07.730 --> 36:09.036
- Oh, now you want help?

36:09.079 --> 36:10.733
- It's, like,
against your oath or whatever.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.083
- You sit on that beanbag
making jokes

36:13.127 --> 36:14.520
while real people
come in here...

36:14.563 --> 36:16.261
- Children.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.566
- And do the work
'cause they wanna get better.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.046
- I want to get better.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.526
- You hijack appointments,

36:20.569 --> 36:23.790
and you get off
on making a scene.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.922
You only want attention.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.796
- I'm just scared.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.283
- Of what?

36:42.765 --> 36:46.595
- That if I died tomorrow

36:46.639 --> 36:48.771
the only thing that people
would remember about me

36:48.815 --> 36:50.469
is what was in my purse.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.298
- What's in it?

36:53.341 --> 36:55.735
- Some parking tickets...

36:55.778 --> 36:57.737
an old cheese stick,

36:57.780 --> 37:00.043
a single googly eye,

37:00.087 --> 37:02.568
sunglasses case--

37:02.611 --> 37:04.352
I lost the sunglasses.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.963
- That's quite an obit.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.530
- Right?

37:12.142 --> 37:14.667
- Friday at 8:30.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.627
- a.m. or p.m.?
- a.m.

37:18.671 --> 37:19.846
- It's kind of early.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.806
I'll make it work.

37:29.769 --> 37:33.033
Why'd you change your mind?

37:33.076 --> 37:36.993
- 'Cause that was so sad.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.474
Pathetic, really.
- Okay.

37:39.518 --> 37:41.563
- A real therapist would
probably have you committed.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.653
- Well, guess I'm in luck then.

37:52.052 --> 37:55.185
- Better not get any of that
fruit gunk on Daddy's cap.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.839
- He said I can keep it.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.847
- Well, what'd they say?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.980
- They'd be honored
to have me back on the force.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.028
- That's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

38:12.072 --> 38:16.729
Then I came home,
tried on my uniform...

38:18.470 --> 38:20.515
Just didn't feel right.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.517
- So I'll let the pants out.
I'll fit it.

38:22.561 --> 38:23.823
- No, it made me--

38:23.866 --> 38:25.781
it made me feel like a fraud,
Ruby.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.612
Can't fix that.

38:47.194 --> 38:51.024
- Dorito Boland?

38:51.067 --> 38:53.548
- That's me.
I'm--I'm Dorito's dad.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.681
- Soon to be grandpa.
- What?

38:55.724 --> 38:58.205
- It's not a tumor.
She's laying an egg.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.946
- Wait, what?

38:59.989 --> 39:02.601
- Got caught in her oviduct.
That's the lump you felt.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.560
Dr. Cromwell's gonna aspirate,
but she'll be fine.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.215
