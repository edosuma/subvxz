00:34.402 --> 00:37.136
You don't actually
have any work experience.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.738
No, but I just
graduated from Fordham.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.707
-How long ago?
-About a year ago.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.176
So what have you
been doing since?

00:44.178 --> 00:45.744
Uh, I've been working on
my own collection,

00:45.746 --> 00:47.312
which takes up a lot of my time.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.814
What about internships?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.417
Isn't that just a way
for companies to exploit

00:51.419 --> 00:53.185
people for free labor?

00:53.587 --> 00:56.321
So how do you expect
to get any experience?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.390
By getting a job?

00:58.392 --> 01:01.226
How do you support
yourself exactly?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.295
My dad helps a little.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.331
A lot. [chuckles]

01:07.201 --> 01:08.834
Well, thanks for coming in, uh--

01:08.836 --> 01:11.570
We'll be in touch after
we've reviewed all candidates.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.673
Okay. Thank you.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.579
Um--

01:21.515 --> 01:23.482
I'm not getting this job, am I?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.584
[sighing] Excuse me?

01:26.687 --> 01:28.821
This is my sixth
interview this month.

01:28.823 --> 01:31.590
Everyone says they'll get in
touch, but then they never do.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.826
Look, I know I don't have
any work experience,

01:33.828 --> 01:37.362
but how am I supposed to get any
experience if I can't get hired?

01:38.132 --> 01:41.333
All I need is a chance.
I have great ideas.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.469
I can bring
so much to your brand.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.404
Look, your drawings aren't bad.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.772
That's what got you in here,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.574
but you think you can waltz out

01:48.576 --> 01:51.176
of fashion school
and get a job designing.

01:51.178 --> 01:54.746

just to get an assistant job.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.149
Daddy may have paid
your way through school,

01:57.151 --> 01:59.151
but out here in the real world

01:59.153 --> 02:00.853
you have to work your way up.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.858
So I guess you won't be
getting in touch?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.293

Oh, I'm sorry, but I know just
the thing that'll cheer you up.

this morning.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.861
-Awful!
<i> -What happened?</i>

03:49.863 --> 03:53.398
The lady was totally
judging me for still
being supported by Dad.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.635
I was like, "Well, if you would
just give me a job then
I wouldn't need to be."

Ha! Like he remembers.
Plus it's been weeks now.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.952
Why don't you just
call him back?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.455
Because I don't know how many
different ways I can tell him

04:16.457 --> 04:18.290
I don't want to
go back to China.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.325
Are you sure you
don't want to consider?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.996
-Just a little?
-Mom, I want to work in
high fashion.

next to the toothpaste aisle

talk about this right now, Mom,

04:35.676 --> 04:37.442

to get ready for.

-I mean, it's not
the whole million.

-I already spent half of it.
-On what?

-A million dollars

is some kind of billionaire.

He runs a toy factory and it's
not even like Mattel or Hasbro.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.366
I mean, still it's just a year
and then after that you can

10:01.368 --> 10:03.635
pretty much do whatever you
want with that kind of money.

who would just give me
a million dollars.

I was my dad's only daughter.

blue, my "sister" Carol shows up

10:28.895 --> 10:32.130

this entire other family

10:32.132 --> 10:34.799
before us and didn't
bother saying anything.

and me to California

10:38.105 --> 10:41.306
and basically just left us here.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.777
I saw him once a year
if even that,

10:45.779 --> 10:51.316
and then he knocked up
a sample girl at his factory
and divorced my mom.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.685
So yeah, if he's going to treat
my mom and me like shit,

10:53.687 --> 10:55.720

anything for him?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.189
What am I supposed
to do for money?

12:05.358 --> 12:06.891
Maybe you can
consider getting a job?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.715
[phone rings in background]

12:13.716 --> 12:16.000
But you don't have
any work experience
or restaurant experience.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.138
No, but it's a hostess job.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.941
How hard could it be to stand
there and greet people?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.009
Well, thanks for coming in.
We'll keep in touch

12:25.011 --> 12:27.445
once we've reviewed
all the other candidates.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.214
Thanks.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.318
Great!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.354
[phone rings]

12:36.356 --> 12:39.457
-Hi, Mom.
<i> -I don't want you to worry,</i>

12:39.459 --> 12:41.993
<i> -but your father--</i>
-What happened?

12:41.995 --> 12:45.130
<i>His office just informed me that</i>
<i> there will be no more alimony</i>

12:45.132 --> 12:48.233
<i> -until you accept his offer.</i>
-Are you kidding?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.469
-Can he even do that?
<i> -Sasha, I'll figure</i>
<i> something out.</i>

12:51.471 --> 12:53.238
[scoffs] No, you know what?
I'll call him right now.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.440
<i> Don't do anything</i>
<i> on account of me.</i>

12:55.442 --> 12:57.041
Look, I'll handle it.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.778
[dialing]

13:01.815 --> 13:05.316
-[dad]<i> Yes?</i>
-You cut off Mom too?
What is wrong with you?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.819
<i> You don't want to</i>
<i> contribute to this family,</i>

13:07.821 --> 13:09.988
<i> why should I continue</i>
<i> supporting the two of you?</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:12.824
How is she supposed to
survive without any alimony?

13:12.826 --> 13:16.027
<i> Then maybe she should</i>
<i> have learned a skill</i>
<i> and gotten a job.</i>

13:16.029 --> 13:17.896
<i> She spoiled you too much.</i>

13:17.898 --> 13:20.165
[scoffing] Well,
at least she was around.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.833
<i> Some good tactic.</i>

13:21.835 --> 13:23.301
You are unbelievable.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.403
<i>This is your last chance, Sasha.</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:29.474
<i> You can either come home</i>
<i> and help out or you can</i>
<i> figure out</i>

13:29.476 --> 13:33.144
<i> how to support you</i>
<i> and your mother on your own.</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:34.312
<i> What would it be?</i>

13:39.820 --> 13:43.521
[uplifting musical build up]

14:07.280 --> 14:08.246
Uh...

14:11.218 --> 14:14.085
I can understand Chinese.
I just don't speak it very well.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.887
Can you understand English?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.597
Yeah, what else is new?

[joyful music]

[soft dramatic music]

15:54.087 --> 15:55.486
Uh, okay.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.290
Hello, ma'am. My name is Maria.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.159
Welcome home.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.194
This is not my home.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.397
-Okay. I show you to your room.
-Okay.

16:07.133 --> 16:11.269
-Holy shit. Is that
an elevator? What?
-[Maria chuckles]

16:22.215 --> 16:24.349
Ma'am, here's the AC
if you get hot or cold

16:24.351 --> 16:26.351
you can adjust it here.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.419
Do you need anything else?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.488
-No, you can go. Thank you.
-Okay.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.264
[oriental music]

[chuckling]

17:02.288 --> 17:03.287
Okay.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.592
[gasping] Oh, my god.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.064
[camera shutter clicks]

Goddamn communist China.

[knocking on door]

17:31.751 --> 17:32.750
Come in.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.188
Ma'am, dinner's ready.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.226
Okay. Can you just give me,
uh, a minute?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.228
[Maria] Okay, ma'am.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.630
Thanks.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.252
Sasha, you're back.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.288
Yep.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.465
-Say hi.
-Hi.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.301
Wow, look at you guys,
you're all grown up.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.850
I've been in California.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.252
Actually, can you guys
understand me?

18:41.254 --> 18:45.456
Yeah, I understand English,
but how come you can't
speak Chinese?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.625
I moved to the U.S.
when I was really young.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.128
So my Chinese is not good.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.468
-Do they live here?
-No.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.371
-They live with their mom
and her new husband.
-[door slams]

19:01.374 --> 19:04.308
[woman] Sorry, I'm late.
Work was nuts.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.210
-Sasha.
-Hey, Carol.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.914
Oh, look at you. I haven't
seen you since my--

19:09.916 --> 19:13.351
[chuckles] See, you should
come back more often.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.686
Even your own sibling
don't recognize you.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.189
Um, I'm here now, aren't I?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.525
[string chamber music]

19:25.231 --> 19:26.697
Everybody, sit down.

19:30.370 --> 19:34.672
Oh, sorry, Carol. Let Sasha
sit there. She's the VIP today.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.343
-Of course, Dad.
-Sasha, you sit here.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.450
[sighs]

19:47.587 --> 19:48.586
[clinking]

19:48.588 --> 19:52.290
Five years ago when
I renovated this house

19:52.292 --> 19:53.891
my friends used to say,

19:53.893 --> 19:56.561
"Mr. Lee, why do you need
such a big house?"

19:56.563 --> 19:59.697
And I would say, "Because I have
lots of children."

20:00.466 --> 20:02.466
It was always my dream

20:02.468 --> 20:05.870
to have all my children
living under the same roof.

20:06.406 --> 20:10.474
Except Sasha was
the missing piece,

20:10.476 --> 20:15.413
but today
the Li family is complete.

20:15.415 --> 20:19.217
So, can we toast Sasha
and welcome her home?

20:19.219 --> 20:21.586
-[all] Welcome home!
-[glasses clinking]

20:26.659 --> 20:29.760
[string chamber music]

20:43.576 --> 20:45.243
Hi, I'm Sasha, and you are?

20:49.549 --> 20:53.317
-Hi, I'm Lulu.
-And Lulu is?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.753
She takes care of me.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.556
Like how Maria
takes care of you?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.826
No. Different way.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.794
Does she live here?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.796
Yes, she lives here.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.432
And who are you?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.469
My name is Aaron.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.473
-I'm brother of Lulu.
-Do you live here?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.275
Uh, yeah.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.711
-Sasha, how was your flight?
-It was fine. Do you live
here too?

21:20.713 --> 21:22.046
No. I have my own place.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.714
Carol has her own place?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.783
I should be able
to have my own place.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.485
Don't you think
you have bled through

21:27.487 --> 21:29.053
enough money already?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.055
Don't you think I'm too old
to be living with

21:31.057 --> 21:33.524
my father and a bunch
of strangers?

21:34.661 --> 21:38.029
You are not in a position
to make any demands.

21:39.499 --> 21:44.568
Carol bought her home with
the money she earned
working for me.

21:44.570 --> 21:48.406
It's just a very small place.
In dollars it's not worth
much of anything at all.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.508
[dad] Are you forgetting
why you're back here?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.644
Because you cut me and mom off
and forced me to.

21:54.580 --> 21:58.516
-You want to pick a fight
first day you're back?
-I think I'm full.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.751
Good night.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.854
It's okay, I'll go talk to her.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.362
Eat.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.501
[knocking on door]

22:17.503 --> 22:20.037
-Leave me alone.
-[Carol] It's me.

22:21.774 --> 22:22.840
Come in.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.578
Are you okay?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.081
I hate it here.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.917
It's only been a day.
I've been here for ten years.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.785
Oh, god, I don't know
how you did it.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.789
Look, Dad and I had our
fair share of fights
in the early days too,

22:38.791 --> 22:41.425
but you're lucky, he's actually
mellowed out a lot since.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.828
This is him mellowed out?

22:43.830 --> 22:46.864
Yes. He told me I could
no longer be his daughter

22:46.866 --> 22:48.432
if I didn't come back
and work for him.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.468
Oh, my god, there's no rules

22:50.470 --> 22:52.770
and you can only pass on
your business to your children.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.105
He's not an emperor.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.874
-Have you seen this place?
-[Sasha scoffs]

22:58.578 --> 23:00.611
-Do you have to live here?
-No, thank god.

23:00.613 --> 23:04.648
By the time he finished
renovating, I had already moved
into my own place with Scott.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.519
[smacking lips] Hey,
I'm sorry about Scott.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.122
It's fine. It was amicable.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.957
Hey...

23:12.959 --> 23:15.793
Who is that
Lulu girl downstairs exactly?

23:16.429 --> 23:18.095
-Who do you think?
-[scoffing]

23:18.097 --> 23:20.164
She better not be
wife number four.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.868
-She looks like she's my age.
-Actually, she's 22.

23:23.870 --> 23:24.835
Ew!

23:24.837 --> 23:28.005
But I think Dad's
learned his lesson now.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.108
It's much cheaper to pay them as
girlfriends than his ex-wives.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.577
Why does her brother live here?

23:33.579 --> 23:35.846
Oh, well, that is just
part of their arrangement.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.848
Dad pays for him to go
to school and in exchange

23:37.850 --> 23:39.784
she "takes care of him."

23:40.153 --> 23:42.553
[exhaling] Great.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.022
So he's going to pay for
his girlfriend's brother

23:45.024 --> 23:48.025
to go to school, but he's
going to cut me off completely?

23:49.429 --> 23:50.194
[sobbing]

23:50.196 --> 23:53.831
I don't want to be here.
I hate Chinese food.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.733
I want to go back to L.A.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.802
No one has avocados.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.537
[sobbing]

24:03.776 --> 24:05.676
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.912
Come, have some breakfast.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.055
Oh, um, do we have anything
else for breakfast?

24:18.558 --> 24:21.725
-What's wrong with congee?
-I don't do carbs
in the morning.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.961
Oh, tell Maria what you want.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.231
Um, can I please do an egg white
omelet with spinach?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.134
I'm sorry ma'am
we're all out of eggs.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.037
[banging] How can you be
out of eggs?

24:33.039 --> 24:35.940
I'm sorry, sir. I use it
all up for dinner last night.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.641
I will buy more later today.

24:38.211 --> 24:41.579
My daughter comes all
the way back from America,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.747
you don't have eggs for
her breakfast?

24:43.749 --> 24:46.016
I'm really sorry, sir.
I go to store now.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.953
No, that's too late, Maria.
We have to go to work.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.822
Dad, it's fine. I'll eat
the congee. It's okay.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.759
Go!

25:09.709 --> 25:14.245
[quirky music]

25:36.836 --> 25:41.105
And you, when we get to
the factory, try and look happy.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.542
I don't want them to see
you acting like this.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.878
My life is over.
How am I supposed to act?

25:50.149 --> 25:53.751
[lively music]

26:58.217 --> 27:00.217

[all applauding louder]

27:35.788 --> 27:37.187
[keyboard clacking]

27:37.923 --> 27:40.991
-Good morning!
Here is your desk.
-[Sasha] Aah.

27:42.294 --> 27:45.829
Don't get too comfortable.
You won't be working
from there today.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.297
What?

27:48.134 --> 27:49.900
Where am I working from, then?

27:50.302 --> 27:54.772
And you will attach the tag
to the toys like her.

27:55.441 --> 28:00.077
-A monkey could do this job.
-Then you will fit right in.

28:05.251 --> 28:09.186
[whimsical music]

28:29.208 --> 28:31.408
I have no idea how
you guys do this all day.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.084
So, how was
your first day of work?

28:40.486 --> 28:42.386
Have I told you lately
that I hate you?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.858
-What is this for?
-Pay.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.261
What? This is
only like 15 bucks.

28:51.263 --> 28:54.398
Yes, and this is what
they earn here in a day.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.735
But that's basically
like slave labor.

28:57.737 --> 29:01.371
Can't apply your American
standard of living to China.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.341
-Come on. Let's go eat.
-What about Carol?

29:05.177 --> 29:07.911
Just busy preparing
for the sales meeting.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.416
-I want you--
Here you take this.
-No.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.485
No, no, take it. Take.

29:16.021 --> 29:16.987
Bye.

29:18.057 --> 29:21.158
[lively music]

29:48.921 --> 29:52.289
Dad, can't we afford a place
a little less ghetto?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.958
Stop being such a princess.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.428
-I never had any food
when I was growing up.
-Here we go again.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.364
Nobody ever took care of me.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.501
You kids have everything
given to you. What have you
done with it?

30:04.503 --> 30:07.104
At least you got to choose what
you want to do with your life.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.373
You know how many people

30:09.375 --> 30:13.010
would love to be in the position
that you're in right now?

30:13.813 --> 30:16.980
To be working in a toy factory
in China? Um...

30:16.982 --> 30:19.583
-No one.
-What's wrong
with a factory in China?

30:19.585 --> 30:22.319
It pays for everything you have,

30:22.321 --> 30:25.823
including your useless
fashion degree.

30:26.358 --> 30:30.027
Gee, well, I'm so sorry that
paying for your child's
education was such a burden.

30:30.029 --> 30:34.031
I paid for your education,
because it is my duty
as a father.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.167
Now is your turn
to pay back to the family.

30:37.570 --> 30:40.470
What about your duty to actually
spend time with your kids?

30:40.472 --> 30:45.175
Oh. Don't you think I wish
I had more time to spend
with my family?

30:45.177 --> 30:49.613
Don't you think my workers wish
they had more time to spend
with their children?

30:49.615 --> 30:54.952
It's a sacrifice we had to make
to support our families.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.594

31:29.555 --> 31:31.255
Where is everyone?

31:31.257 --> 31:34.524
Maria has the day off,
your dad is playing golf

31:34.526 --> 31:37.094
-and Alan has tutoring.
-[phone chiming]

31:37.096 --> 31:39.496

-Yeah.

[water bubbling]

31:46.538 --> 31:50.974
Hey, do you want
to get out the house?

32:07.126 --> 32:09.026
But I already washed
my hair this morning.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.628
Oh, but this is so much more.
You'll see.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.530
Okay.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.433
[Chinese pop music]

32:20.005 --> 32:22.339
-Nice, right?
-Yeah.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.475
I've never received service
like this at any salon before

32:25.477 --> 32:27.711
and my haircuts cost
like 200 bucks.

32:27.713 --> 32:31.014
What? All this is
only 15 renminbi here.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.084
-That's only like eight bucks.
-Yeah.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.953
[scoffing]

32:37.189 --> 32:38.956

32:41.560 --> 32:43.493
You certainly
seem to be popular.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.095
Oh, that's just my WeChat.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.164
You should join,
everybody's on it.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.300
I have it on my phone. I just--
I don't know how to use it.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.336
Here, I'll show you.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.575
[phone clicking]

32:59.211 --> 33:02.579
-Okay, now we're connected.
-Cool. Thanks.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.615
So, is this what keeps you
on your phone all day?

33:05.617 --> 33:08.618
Well, it's so boring
around the house.

33:08.620 --> 33:12.356
-I don't have
anything else to do.
-Yeah, no kidding.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.157
Would you ever want to get like

33:14.159 --> 33:16.426
a job or something,
so you can get out of there?

33:16.428 --> 33:22.332
Yes, but boss won't let me.
I mean, he is my job.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.234
Ew.

33:27.139 --> 33:31.041
I know what you must
think of me, but I never
even finished high school.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.609
There's not much I can do.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.579
Taking care of boss
isn't that bad.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.280
And he pays me pretty well.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.385
Besides, my brother
was born illegally.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.487
He doesn't really have
many options in life.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.722
Wait, what do you mean?

33:47.026 --> 33:48.558
The one child policy.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.194
The second child cannot
be registered officially

33:51.196 --> 33:52.729
and cannot go to public school.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.333
Without boss sending him
to private school,

33:56.335 --> 33:58.068
he would have no future at all.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.040
-So you're doing all of
this for your brother?
-Yes.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.611
What about after all of this?
What do you want to do with
your life then?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.247
Probably come back here.

34:12.384 --> 34:16.219
-Wait, is this
how you met my dad?
-Yes.

34:18.791 --> 34:19.723
Wow.

34:19.725 --> 34:20.757
[dad] Right?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.492
Look at this one.

34:30.402 --> 34:35.605
Poor Santa, had to OD to get all
the toys ready for Christmas.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.742
So that's our Christmas line.
What do you think?

34:40.379 --> 34:44.381
Thank you, Teddy, for another
entertaining presentation
as always.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.083
Can we quote anything for you?

34:46.852 --> 34:48.285
Um-- [sighing]

34:48.754 --> 34:51.121
Okay, uh, this one.

34:51.657 --> 34:54.391
And this one, and...

34:55.761 --> 34:57.861
What do you think
of snoring Santa?

34:57.863 --> 34:59.529
-[scoffing] No.
-Hmm.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.099
Okay, that's it. Thank you.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.337
Oh, can we show you something
else here? It's not a problem.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.842
Teddy, I'm going
to be frank with you.

35:11.844 --> 35:15.145
The collection this year is
not the strongest we've seen.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.147
Especially compared to
some of your competitors.

35:17.149 --> 35:21.151
The colors and the accessories,
it all feels kind of dated.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.820
You used to have
the coolest products.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.423
Then you became one of
those wheezy Chinese guys

35:26.425 --> 35:28.492
that keeps knocking
each other off.

35:28.494 --> 35:31.428
You know, but they can
do it for less than you.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.364
Thank you for being honest.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.167
I'm sorry to disappoint
you this time,

35:37.169 --> 35:40.871
but we will make improvements
before you come next time.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.541
-Looking forward to it.
-We'll walk you out.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.183
-That wasn't good, huh?
-Um-hm.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.311
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.584
Do you like working here?

36:28.787 --> 36:31.788
-[both] Yes, sir.
-Then, why do you humiliate me?

36:32.457 --> 36:34.224
-We're not humilia-- no.
-We are sorry, sir.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.760
Do you think I like
begging for orders?

36:36.762 --> 36:40.764
You think I like be reprimanded
by the bloody buyer

36:40.766 --> 36:43.200

-Look at this fabric.
Look at it! What you've done?
-Dad, stop.

36:50.542 --> 36:55.245
We have just a few meetings
left to pitch for Christmas

36:55.247 --> 37:00.283
and if they all go like today,
this factory will have
to close down.

37:00.285 --> 37:03.220
All the workers will have
to go back to their farms.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.555
Is that what you want?

37:05.557 --> 37:08.758
-[both] No, sir.
-Then you will work overtime

37:08.760 --> 37:12.529
until you come up with
a decent Christmas collection.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.931
-Do you hear me?
-[both] Yes, sir.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.299

-Baidu.

supposed to design anything

to the outside world?

Do we know anything
about [indistinct] in a circle?

38:52.064 --> 38:55.565

and people will take it
a little more seriously.

to have more colors.

-Sasha, have you got
the inventory done?

It's okay, Carol. Yes,
Sasha, what do you want?

39:04.076 --> 39:06.509
I was just in the design studio.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.111
Their techniques
are really good.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.647
It's just that the designs
are old-fashioned.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.982
The buyer was right.
They're cooped up in here

39:12.984 --> 39:14.951
in the middle of
China every day.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.987
I mean, no wonder nothing
they design is on trend.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.689
They don't even
know what the trend is.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.424
How are they supposed
to come up with fresh

39:21.426 --> 39:22.926
and innovative designs this way?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.461
What are you suggesting?

39:24.463 --> 39:25.595
Let me take them out
to Hong Kong

39:25.597 --> 39:27.063
and do some market research.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.800
-And blow some money?
-We'll just be window shopping.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.903
I think it'll be really good for
them to see what the trends are
this season.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.373
We've got a lot of deadlines
coming up. We can't afford

39:36.375 --> 39:39.409
to have the designers take
the day off and just
go shopping.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.545
Why are you guys
so resistant to new ideas?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.115
Fine. Keep selling
dated toys. See if I care.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.754
-[clapping] Okay.
-Really?

39:50.756 --> 39:52.989
-Can I have some money?
-Are you serious?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.658
You canceled
my credit card, remember?

39:57.462 --> 40:00.130
-Okay, get some petty cash
from accounts.
-Thank you.

40:01.767 --> 40:02.732

40:02.734 --> 40:05.902
-Yes.
-I proposed the same
thing years ago.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.171
You always dismissed it
as a waste of time.

40:08.173 --> 40:11.875
[sighs] Don't you remember
what the buyer was saying?

40:11.877 --> 40:14.544
Competition is getting
tougher and tougher.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.480
I just thought, should I check
with her design background?

40:17.482 --> 40:20.083
She might come up with something
that will turn things around.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.118
Yeah.

to give me a chance

There's no one
to take care of them.

the guitar.

43:13.058 --> 43:15.692
You didn't know
your dad was in a band?

43:15.694 --> 43:19.362
-[scoffing] What? When was this?
-A lifetime ago.

43:19.864 --> 43:22.298
-Ha, we even went touring.
-Shut up.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.634
Why'd you stop pursuing it?

43:25.036 --> 43:27.637
Well, when I met Carol's mom

43:27.639 --> 43:29.806
I had to settle down,
so I got a proper job.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.342
-Selling toys?
-That's right.

43:32.344 --> 43:36.312
And I became the number-one
salesman in that company.

43:36.915 --> 43:40.683
-The lady buyers, they loved me.
-Ew.

43:40.685 --> 43:43.820
Uh-uh, I honestly think
if it wasn't for Carol,

43:43.822 --> 43:45.188
I might still be there.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.957
Why? What does Carol
have to do with it?

43:47.959 --> 43:49.225
I became a father.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.029
So I thought, start
my own business

43:53.031 --> 43:55.264
to provide better
for the family.

43:56.901 --> 43:58.167
Cool, yeah?

43:58.169 --> 44:00.003
-Sure. Cool.
-[both chuckling]

44:00.005 --> 44:03.106
[whimsical music]

44:04.409 --> 44:07.877
[Sasha] I see a pastel trend
kind of happening.

44:07.879 --> 44:11.314
Maybe we should do some
animals in like pastel pink

44:11.316 --> 44:14.651
-or pistachio,
something lighter.
-Um-hmm.

44:16.655 --> 44:18.354
[Jose] Ma'am, what do you think?

44:19.090 --> 44:21.324
[Sasha] Honestly,
it's still kind of traditional.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.760
Maybe we should give it
like a kawaii look.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.128
Do you know what that is?

44:25.130 --> 44:27.230
-Uh, can you sketch?
-Yeah.

44:28.366 --> 44:30.066
Let's sketch something.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.369
[joyful music]

44:38.309 --> 44:40.109
So maybe...

44:40.779 --> 44:43.379
something like this.

44:44.749 --> 44:46.783
-It's really good, ma'am.
-Really?

44:46.785 --> 44:48.351
[chuckling] Yeah. Ernesto.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.853
-[bell ringing]
-Oh, yes.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.388
[Jose] Right? [chuckles]

44:53.124 --> 44:54.323
Ready for lunch?

44:54.325 --> 44:57.727
Uh, I think I'm going to
eat in the canteen today.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.697
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

45:00.699 --> 45:02.198
Well, if it's good
enough for the workers,

45:02.200 --> 45:03.900
it's good enough for me.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.968
It's not really how we do
things around here.

45:07.038 --> 45:08.971
Okay, lighten up, Carol.

45:09.841 --> 45:13.076
Fine. Suit yourself. When are
the drawings for clients
gonna be done?

45:13.778 --> 45:16.312
-Tomorrow, ma'am.
-You said that yesterday.

45:16.314 --> 45:19.015
I need them before the end of
today. Do you understand?

45:19.818 --> 45:20.817
Yes, ma'am.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.457
Are you sure you want
to eat with us?

45:27.459 --> 45:30.760
Yeah, I mean,
it can't be that bad, yeah?

45:31.496 --> 45:34.397
[intense music]

45:38.236 --> 45:40.903
[lively music]

45:45.844 --> 45:47.810
[Chinese chatter]

46:00.492 --> 46:03.192
-What kind of meat is this?
-Uh...

46:03.194 --> 46:05.027
Actually I don't want to know.

46:08.266 --> 46:11.167
Mm. Very chewy.

46:11.169 --> 46:12.869
-Mm-hmm.
-And bland.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.104
That's why we take
this everywhere.

46:15.106 --> 46:18.274
Yeah, we used to get a piece
of fruit after each meal

46:18.276 --> 46:22.378
-and it was something fresh
that we looked forward to.
-They cut it out.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.348
-There's no budget.
-That's not right.

46:25.350 --> 46:28.117
-Has my dad eaten
here before?
-No.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.819
How about Carol?

46:29.821 --> 46:33.823
-[both] No.
-We spent more time
with you in the last few weeks

46:33.825 --> 46:36.125
than all the years
that Carol has been here.

46:36.127 --> 46:39.562
[scoffing] I guess Carrol
doesn't really socialize
with the workers, huh?

46:39.564 --> 46:44.367
-You're much nicer than Carol.
-She is just as scary
as boss sometimes.

46:44.903 --> 46:46.469
She's not always like that.

46:47.338 --> 46:48.938
[background chatter]

46:55.980 --> 46:59.081
[jolly music]

47:08.226 --> 47:10.827
Dad, we should serve
better food in the cafeteria.

47:10.829 --> 47:12.495
It's basically tasteless mush.

47:13.865 --> 47:15.498
Who told you to eat there?

47:15.500 --> 47:17.567
They should get
a side of vegetables

47:17.569 --> 47:20.203
and Ernesto said that they used
to get a piece of fruit, too.

47:22.307 --> 47:27.343
-So trivial.
We run the big picture.
-Yeah, but you're the boss.

47:27.345 --> 47:30.546
You know, it reflects badly
on you if the food is so gross.

47:30.548 --> 47:34.250
Besides, I mean, better food
leads to better morale.

47:34.252 --> 47:37.587
How much could it possibly be
to just have like one
extra apple a day?

47:38.156 --> 47:41.157
If you're too cheap to do it,
then take it out of my paycheck.

47:41.960 --> 47:46.028
Really? How much do you
think your paycheck is exactly?

47:47.498 --> 47:49.198
Please.

47:50.635 --> 47:51.634
Please.

47:54.005 --> 47:56.105
[laughing] How about
the video of this guy?

48:01.179 --> 48:03.412
-See? Everyone loves you.
-[Jose] Look at that.

48:03.915 --> 48:06.582
-[Jose] Who doesn't
love fruit, right?
-It's nothing.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.084
[Jose] Very good.

48:18.930 --> 48:22.298
-Sasha, you have some designs?
-Yes.

48:22.300 --> 48:24.500
So the designers and I have
been working on

48:24.502 --> 48:26.636
some new concepts for Christmas.

48:26.638 --> 48:29.472
And this is
what we came up with.

48:37.515 --> 48:38.915
What do you think?

48:39.651 --> 48:42.084
A sloth for Christmas?

48:42.086 --> 48:44.520
And the colors feel
more like Easter?

48:44.522 --> 48:47.423
-Yeah shouldn't they
be red and green?
-Says who?

48:48.026 --> 48:50.059
I mean, pastels are
really in right now.

48:50.061 --> 48:51.694
And so are woodland creatures.

48:51.696 --> 48:54.597
No one says that you can't
sell sloths for Christmas.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.399
We could make up our own rules.

49:04.509 --> 49:07.343
-I suppose we can
give it a try.
-Really?

49:07.345 --> 49:11.247
Yeah, a bit different. Is what
the customers want, right?

49:23.661 --> 49:27.229
-[bell ringing]
-[dad] Okay, boys,
you can have lunch.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.700
So, where do you want
to go to lunch?

49:30.702 --> 49:33.135
I think I'm gonna eat
in the cafeteria today.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.204
You don't have
to keep going there, you know.

49:35.206 --> 49:38.107
No, I know, but the food
has gotten so much better.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.308
Have fun, you guys.

49:43.581 --> 49:45.047
I guess it's just us.

49:45.049 --> 49:49.018
Do you really think
Sasha's designs are sellable?

49:49.387 --> 49:51.420
Well, like I said,
let's give it a try.

49:52.123 --> 49:53.689
Got nothing to lose, right?

49:55.093 --> 49:59.095
Clearly though, whatever we've
been doing, stopped growth.

49:59.097 --> 50:00.696
Dad, last year
was hard on everybody.

50:00.698 --> 50:04.033
It wasn't just us.
The business will rebound.

50:04.602 --> 50:07.269
I remember when I first
started the business.

50:08.139 --> 50:13.309
I was making 20, 25 percent
profit on each toy.

50:14.379 --> 50:17.446
Today, we've been lucky
if we can make ten percent.

50:18.683 --> 50:21.250
You know, I worked
so hard all my life.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.387
What if it all comes to nothing?

50:24.389 --> 50:26.188
Dad, what are you talking about?

50:26.190 --> 50:28.090
You've accomplished
so much with your life.

50:28.092 --> 50:32.128
No, real success is
when the father can pass on

50:32.130 --> 50:34.230
a thriving business
to his children.

50:34.599 --> 50:37.299
Don't you think that puts
a lot of pressure on your kids?

50:37.301 --> 50:42.638
Pressure comes from having
to provide a livelihood
for 500 workers.

50:43.174 --> 50:45.674
Being head of a business is not.

50:47.278 --> 50:49.512
[gentle music]

50:54.819 --> 50:56.118
My favorite.

50:57.722 --> 51:01.457
-Mr. Reindeer here comes
in different sizes.
-Right.

51:01.459 --> 51:05.528
-And so does Santa,
as you can see.
-I see. Very nice.

51:05.530 --> 51:08.097
And here is our new collection.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.100
Is very close to my heart.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.135
-You know why?
-Why?

51:13.137 --> 51:16.305
Because my daughter Sasha
designed the whole collection.

51:16.307 --> 51:19.175
Oh, that's nice.
You must be so proud.

51:19.177 --> 51:22.311
Well, she studied fashion
in the U.S.

51:22.313 --> 51:26.515
This is why her color
combination, are very special.
Don't you think?

51:26.851 --> 51:28.517
[clicking tongue] They are
different and fresh.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.086
I'll give you that.

51:30.455 --> 51:33.122
Personally, I think they're
great, but I don't think

51:33.124 --> 51:35.458
our customers will be
quite open to it.

51:35.827 --> 51:38.761
This is for
our Christmas promotion.

51:38.763 --> 51:41.230
So I think they would expect
to see a little bit of

51:41.232 --> 51:43.232
red and green in
their Christmas toys.

51:43.234 --> 51:44.867
Oh, well,
we have that over there.

51:44.869 --> 51:46.635
-With all due respect.
-Sasha.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.471
Department stores
are all chasing

51:48.473 --> 51:50.306
unexpected color
palettes right now.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.641
And you guys are
the oldest and largest

51:52.643 --> 51:54.477
gift chain in the United States.

51:54.479 --> 51:57.346
I mean, you set the trend
and others follow.

51:57.348 --> 52:00.716
Consumers don't know
what they want
until you show it to them.

52:01.819 --> 52:04.620
-I'm sorry about--
-No, it's fine.

52:07.358 --> 52:10.860
You know what?
Quote me the entire collection.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.195
[exhales]

52:13.631 --> 52:14.830
Thank you so much.

52:14.832 --> 52:18.200
-Would you like to see more?
-Please, let's take a look.

52:21.706 --> 52:22.638
[camera clicking]

52:22.640 --> 52:25.708
[gentle music]

52:33.451 --> 52:34.683
Good job today.

52:36.754 --> 52:37.820
Thanks.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.189
[machine whirring]

52:40.925 --> 52:44.426
-Yeah, this color is very good.
-I like the mouth.

52:44.428 --> 52:46.262
-Yeah.
-Sasha.

52:46.631 --> 52:49.565
-Dahlia's has placed an order
for your collection.
-AW! What?

52:49.567 --> 52:52.201
-Let me see.
-200,000 pieces.

52:52.203 --> 52:56.172
-That's huge.
-Thank god. Just what we need.

52:56.874 --> 52:59.909
Oh, Carol, um, I think
this is a good time

52:59.911 --> 53:02.745
for Sasha to take over
the Dahlia's account.

53:04.682 --> 53:07.249
Oh, well, I've been taking
care of them for ten years.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.318
I know, you've done a good job,

53:09.320 --> 53:12.555
but I think she can take on
more responsibilities.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.559
-Yeah, you're right.
-Really?

53:17.929 --> 53:19.929
Thank you. I won't let you down.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.931
Can we go out
and celebrate tonight?

53:22.733 --> 53:26.602
Carol you're 34,
go out if you want. Go.

53:27.305 --> 53:28.771
Okay, let's do it.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.374
-What'd you have in mind?
-Hong Kong.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.944
[upbeat pop music]

53:34.946 --> 53:39.248
[Carol and Sasha chattering]

53:41.752 --> 53:44.520
-Your turn.
-Oh, no, I can't.

53:44.522 --> 53:46.655
Oh, come on, Carol,
live a little.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.624
When was the last time
you had a shot?

53:49.293 --> 53:52.561
-Honestly can't remember.
-Take the shot.

53:52.997 --> 53:56.498
Very good. Yes.
[chuckling]

53:58.803 --> 54:00.236
-Yes!
-Oh, my god.

54:00.238 --> 54:01.437
Seriously.
what have you been doing

54:01.439 --> 54:03.239
for fun all these years?

54:03.241 --> 54:05.608
Well, I met Scott right away.
So, that helped.

54:05.610 --> 54:08.944
-Oh, so that's why
you stayed here for so long.
-Partly.

54:10.014 --> 54:12.881
Hey, so what, what
happened with you guys?

54:12.883 --> 54:15.718
I'm-- I'm sorry,
I didn't reach out when I heard.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.420
Well, the official story is
that he wanted to leave China

54:18.422 --> 54:21.323
-and I wasn't ready to.
-And the real reason?

54:22.927 --> 54:26.262
We wanted to have a family,
but I just couldn't
make it happen.

54:26.631 --> 54:28.430
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:29.634 --> 54:32.534
This whole time I thought
Scott just wanted to go
back to the US.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.304
We were trying for years.

54:36.274 --> 54:39.441
-Kind of came up with
this crazy theory.
-What?

54:39.877 --> 54:42.378
I thought it had
something to do with Dad.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.581
What? Like he was such
a shitty father that now
you can't have children?

54:45.583 --> 54:49.351
I know that it sounds crazy,
but I just thought it was like

54:49.353 --> 54:51.787
karmic payback for
all the kids that he--

54:52.523 --> 54:55.357
-You know.
-What?

54:56.294 --> 54:57.926
-You know.
-No, what?

54:59.664 --> 55:02.031
-He got rid of.
-What?

55:02.833 --> 55:05.567
Uh, I'm sorry,
I thought that you knew.

55:05.569 --> 55:06.802
When did this happen?

55:06.804 --> 55:09.038
He had a lot of girlfriends
while he was married.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.639
So just do the math.

55:10.941 --> 55:12.074
[scoffing]

55:13.444 --> 55:14.476
Wow.

55:17.448 --> 55:18.414
Hey...

55:18.416 --> 55:22.017
My mom never really
told me the full story.

55:23.421 --> 55:26.755
Was dad still married to
your mom when he met mine?

55:27.758 --> 55:28.824
Yeah.

55:29.694 --> 55:31.727
-My god. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

55:31.729 --> 55:33.595
I mean,
it's not your fault, but...

55:34.632 --> 55:36.398
how could you not have known?

55:36.400 --> 55:39.868
I mean, honestly,
until you guys came to
stay with us that summer,

55:39.870 --> 55:43.372
I had no idea that Dad had
like this whole other family.

55:43.374 --> 55:45.708
Just kind of the reason
they got divorced.

55:45.710 --> 55:47.776
And then we ended up
moving to New York, so...

55:47.778 --> 55:51.013
Wow, for what it's worth,
he did the same exact
thing to us.

55:51.716 --> 55:54.383
I barely saw him once
we moved to California, so.

55:54.852 --> 55:55.818
Karma.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.656
Sorry that we weren't
closer when we were growing up.

56:02.093 --> 56:05.027
-But hey, we got each other now.
-We do.

56:05.029 --> 56:06.128
[clinking]

56:06.130 --> 56:07.730
[pencil scratching]

56:12.670 --> 56:14.370
[knocking on door]

56:14.372 --> 56:15.404
Come in.

56:18.442 --> 56:19.508
Oh hi, Dad.

56:21.078 --> 56:24.713
-What are you drawing?
-Just doodling some
Easter designs.

56:25.649 --> 56:28.684
-They look cute.
-Yeah, I'm just playing around.

56:31.021 --> 56:33.689
-Here.
-What's this?

56:38.763 --> 56:42.064
-Dad?
-It's your money.
I'm giving it back to you.

56:43.501 --> 56:46.969
-I don't know
if I can accept this.
-What, after everything

56:46.971 --> 56:48.670
you don't want your money back?

56:49.407 --> 56:51.006
I don't feel
like I've earned it.

56:51.008 --> 56:52.674
I mean, the year
isn't even up yet.

56:52.676 --> 56:53.976
Oh, well, never mind.

56:53.978 --> 56:56.145
I can see you have grown so well

56:56.147 --> 56:57.713
into the business already.

56:58.482 --> 57:02.017
Please keep it. You earned it,
but promise me

57:02.019 --> 57:04.686
-don't blow it like before.
-[chuckles] Okay.

57:05.523 --> 57:07.923
-Good night.
-Thanks, Dad.

57:10.795 --> 57:11.727
[door closing]

57:11.729 --> 57:14.830
[gentle music]

57:28.879 --> 57:31.480
Oh. You know what?

57:31.482 --> 57:33.582
I think it might
actually be cuter if we use

57:33.584 --> 57:35.918
this fabric for the scarf.
What do you think?

57:41.459 --> 57:43.225
Oh, it's fine. I mean,
I'll email the buyer

57:43.227 --> 57:44.860
and let her know
it's a better design choice.

57:44.862 --> 57:47.029
I'll get the sample approved.
Don't worry.

57:51.869 --> 57:55.070
[scoffing] Hey, I'm
in charge of this work.

57:55.706 --> 57:59.074
-So it only matters
what I say. Understand?
-Okay.

58:01.612 --> 58:02.811
Gotcha!

58:02.813 --> 58:03.979
-[laser shooting]
-[explosions]

58:03.981 --> 58:05.080
Sucker!

58:05.082 --> 58:06.682
[videogame beeping]

58:07.618 --> 58:08.951
Christian?

58:11.856 --> 58:13.255
[videogame beeping]

58:14.058 --> 58:15.891
[Christian sighing]

58:15.893 --> 58:18.727
Sasha, Dior and Christian

58:18.729 --> 58:20.262
are going to come
and stay for a while.

58:20.264 --> 58:22.764
-Is that okay?
-Yeah, of course.

58:22.766 --> 58:24.533
Why, did something happen?

58:24.869 --> 58:27.769
Their mom is going to America,
to have the new baby.

58:27.771 --> 58:30.606
Oh, you guys are going to have
a new sibling! Are you excited?

58:30.608 --> 58:32.007
[videogame beeping]

58:34.011 --> 58:35.010
Okay.

59:15.819 --> 59:16.785
Ha!

59:18.956 --> 59:20.055
Excuse me?

59:44.715 --> 59:46.882
[Christian] Yeah,
I win again, loser!

59:46.884 --> 59:49.885
-Epic! Take that, sucker!
-Christian!

59:49.887 --> 59:53.355
-[machines hissing]
-Here you go. The PPS,
all ready for production.

59:57.127 --> 59:59.661
Yeah, but the customer signed
off on it. So it's fine, see?

1:00:01.699 --> 1:00:03.599
Why is everyone making
such a big deal out of

1:00:03.601 --> 1:00:05.901
one little piece of fabric?
The customer signed off on it.

1:00:05.903 --> 1:00:08.670
Now, just go and order
all the materials, okay?

1:00:15.646 --> 1:00:18.880
I don't understand
why my collection
failed testing?

1:00:18.882 --> 1:00:20.215
Let me see a sample.

1:00:25.389 --> 1:00:27.222
When did this scarf fabric
got changed to this?

1:00:27.224 --> 1:00:28.924
I changed it on
the pre-production sample

1:00:28.926 --> 1:00:30.292
just cause it looked better.

1:00:30.294 --> 1:00:32.094
Yeah, but we stopped using
this fabric

1:00:32.096 --> 1:00:34.196
because the sequins are
a potential choking hazard.

1:00:34.198 --> 1:00:36.698
-Oh, I didn't know.
-Why didn't you check with us

1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:38.800
-first before you changed it?
-I-- I--

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:42.704
-Is there a problem?
-Yeah, Sasha's collection
failed testing.

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.941
-Why?
-She changed
the fabric on the scarf.

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:47.909
Who told you to make a change?

1:00:48.278 --> 1:00:50.379
I just thought
it looked prettier. I'm sorry.

1:00:50.381 --> 1:00:52.781
Shit. I have to check
on the fabric.

1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:57.953
[thudding and whirring]

1:01:10.234 --> 1:01:12.834
-Hey!
-I'm so sorry for this mistake.

1:01:12.836 --> 1:01:14.936
Can we switch back
to the original fabric?

1:01:14.938 --> 1:01:16.405
I can email the client
and let her know.

1:01:16.407 --> 1:01:18.006
It's not that simple.

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:20.075
We have already ordered
all the fabric.

1:01:20.077 --> 1:01:21.777
If we start over now,

1:01:21.779 --> 1:01:23.679
we will miss our ship date

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:26.014
and they will make us pay
for the air freight.

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:29.885
-I'm sorry.
-Now I have to work out
how to clean up your mess.

1:01:38.095 --> 1:01:40.162
Carol, please don't yell at him,
okay? It's not his fault.
It's mine.

1:01:40.164 --> 1:01:41.797
You have to hold
the staff accountable

1:01:41.799 --> 1:01:43.999
when they screw up.
They're not your friends.

1:01:44.001 --> 1:01:46.168
You sound like Dad,
what's gotten into you?

1:01:46.170 --> 1:01:49.838
Sasha, we're running a business
here. This isn't
your personal playground.

1:01:57.948 --> 1:01:59.281
[muffled speech]

1:02:15.065 --> 1:02:16.998
What'd you guys decide?

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.367
We're gonna send a sample with
the original scarf to retest.

1:02:20.104 --> 1:02:23.338
But wouldn't the toy itself
technically still be unsafe?

1:02:24.074 --> 1:02:26.208
These tests are
just formalities.
It's highly unlikely

1:02:26.210 --> 1:02:28.910
that somebody would actually
choke on one of the sequins.

1:02:30.414 --> 1:02:32.848
But wouldn't we still be
lying to the customer?

1:02:33.383 --> 1:02:35.751
It's not a big deal
if no one gets hurt.

1:02:37.788 --> 1:02:40.856
[melancholic music]

1:02:40.858 --> 1:02:43.759
[lively music]

1:02:44.128 --> 1:02:45.260
[whirring]

1:02:46.296 --> 1:02:47.329
[hissing]

1:02:52.336 --> 1:02:53.535
[scratching]

1:03:07.184 --> 1:03:08.316
[toy laughing]

1:03:08.318 --> 1:03:10.385
Happiest monkey on Earth.

1:03:10.387 --> 1:03:12.254
-[laughing]
-[door slamming]

1:03:18.061 --> 1:03:19.227
[stammering]

1:03:21.098 --> 1:03:23.865
-I'm sorry.
-No worries. I'll just
look around by myself.

1:03:34.444 --> 1:03:36.878
-Get rid of her!
-Hi. Dior, come on,

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:39.414
-not in the showroom, okay?
Let's just take this outside.
-[door slamming]

1:03:39.416 --> 1:03:41.883
So sorry.
She just started running as
soon as we got out of the car.

1:03:41.885 --> 1:03:44.219
-Just get out of here.
-Come on, Dior, let's go.

1:03:46.557 --> 1:03:48.290
I'm so sorry.

1:03:48.292 --> 1:03:50.959
Kids, they are very spoiled.

1:03:50.961 --> 1:03:52.961
Shouldn't you be
checking in on her?

1:03:55.399 --> 1:03:57.999
-Dior, just stop it.
-Dior!

1:03:58.001 --> 1:04:00.202
This is not how
a good girl behaves.

1:04:00.204 --> 1:04:03.004
Oh, so he can do this in
the office, but I can't?

1:04:03.006 --> 1:04:06.007
-Who told you to copy him?
-Aren't we supposed
to learn from our parents?

1:04:06.009 --> 1:04:09.477
The good parts.
Just because he's acting like
a baby doesn't mean you have to.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:13.114
-[thudding]
-You are embarrassing yourself
in front of the whole office.

1:04:13.116 --> 1:04:15.617
-Look, everyone's watching you.
-I don't care!

1:04:15.619 --> 1:04:18.119
What do they expect when
I have a father like that?

1:04:18.121 --> 1:04:20.922
He never taught me
any manners, okay?

1:04:20.924 --> 1:04:22.858
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:24.459
He wasn't there for me
and Carol, and you don't see us

1:04:24.461 --> 1:04:26.228
going around the office
throwing a tantrum, do you?

1:04:26.230 --> 1:04:28.296
At least he didn't give
you guys back.

1:04:29.233 --> 1:04:31.166
What? What are you
talking about?

1:04:32.336 --> 1:04:34.569
Dad actually won the kids
in the custody battle.

1:04:34.571 --> 1:04:37.472
What? What judge
would award him the kids?

1:04:38.442 --> 1:04:41.443
-Oh.
-But after a month
of living with them,

1:04:41.445 --> 1:04:43.378
Dad realized he couldn't
possibly take care of them.

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:46.114
-So he gave them back
to their mom.
-Really?

1:04:51.889 --> 1:04:56.191
Hey, I'm sorry, kiddo, at least
he actually fought for you.

1:04:56.193 --> 1:04:59.127
-That has to count for
something, right?
-I'm not stupid.

1:04:59.129 --> 1:05:01.963
I know he did it
to get off paying child support.

1:05:01.965 --> 1:05:03.598
Look, when I was your age

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:06.334
Dad left my mom to go
live with Sasha's mom.

1:05:07.170 --> 1:05:09.271
For the longest time I thought
I had done something wrong

1:05:09.273 --> 1:05:11.373
to make him leave
and go have another family.

1:05:13.210 --> 1:05:15.477
But I grew up. I got over it.

1:05:17.614 --> 1:05:20.582
You can let your parents'
divorce hang over your head
for the rest of your life

1:05:20.584 --> 1:05:23.184
and use that as an excuse
for everything that goes wrong

1:05:23.186 --> 1:05:25.921
or you can choose not to let it
define who you are.

1:05:50.347 --> 1:05:53.148
She's your daughter too,
take some responsibility.

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:56.217
You already screwed up
your last two families.

1:05:56.219 --> 1:05:58.253
Christian and Dior are young
still, so there's time

1:05:58.255 --> 1:06:00.255
but you don't want them
growing up resenting you

1:06:00.257 --> 1:06:02.324
or worse, feeling indifferent.

1:06:02.326 --> 1:06:05.260
Yes, Dad, she's acting out
because she feels neglected.

1:06:05.262 --> 1:06:07.429
Sasha and I both know
firsthand how that feels.

1:06:07.965 --> 1:06:09.965
You have to start
connecting with her now

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:11.366
before it's too late.

1:06:32.255 --> 1:06:34.456
[lively music]

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:53.208
Yes. Yes, I understand. Yes.

1:07:03.053 --> 1:07:06.021
Carol, Sasha, get over here.

1:07:11.695 --> 1:07:13.428
I just had a call from Dahlia's.

1:07:13.430 --> 1:07:18.733
-Is something wrong?
-A kid choked on some loose
sequins from the scarf.

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:21.536
-Oh, my god. Are they okay?
-Yes.

1:07:21.538 --> 1:07:25.740
They had to recall the whole
stock including the ones
without the scarf.

1:07:25.742 --> 1:07:28.410
-Shit.
-We are now on the black list.

1:07:28.412 --> 1:07:31.379
-They will never do
business with us again.
-Sorry.

1:07:31.815 --> 1:07:35.316
I have kept this business
going for 34 years

1:07:35.318 --> 1:07:40.055
and you...
have destroyed it in one.

1:07:40.557 --> 1:07:44.125
Dad, Sasha's new, there's no way
that she could have known.

1:07:44.127 --> 1:07:46.561
I'm not the one who decided
to fake the test result.

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:48.663
And you're not to blame?

1:07:48.665 --> 1:07:50.665
Dad, let's try to figure out
how to resolve this issue

1:07:50.667 --> 1:07:52.233
instead of just attacking Sasha.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:53.501
There's nothing to resolve.

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:55.303
Let's just close
down the company.

1:07:55.305 --> 1:07:56.604
Isn't that what you want?

1:07:56.606 --> 1:07:58.440
No, why would you say that?

1:07:58.442 --> 1:08:01.376
You never wanted to come back
in the first place.

1:08:01.378 --> 1:08:04.579
You know how hard
all my workers have to work

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:06.781
so you can have your high life?

1:08:06.783 --> 1:08:09.384
Yes, I know how hard they have
to work and I feel like

1:08:09.386 --> 1:08:11.286
I've tried my best to help them.

1:08:11.721 --> 1:08:15.557
Your little stunt have just
cost their annual trip home.

1:08:16.126 --> 1:08:19.461
-What are you talking about?
-I'm canceling
their bonuses.

1:08:19.463 --> 1:08:22.097
Dad, there's got
to be a better way.

1:08:22.099 --> 1:08:24.599
No other way.
We have to cover the cost.

1:08:24.601 --> 1:08:27.769
I wish I never asked you
to come back in the first place.

1:08:28.371 --> 1:08:32.240
You are nothing
but a selfish, spoiled brat,

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:36.511
totally useless and will always
be a disappointment to me.

1:08:36.847 --> 1:08:39.481
[sad music]

1:08:40.517 --> 1:08:41.649
[scoffing]

1:08:48.325 --> 1:08:50.325
[gasping]

1:08:50.694 --> 1:08:52.127
[Carol] Sasha!

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:56.698
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

1:08:57.367 --> 1:08:59.868
Sasha, don't act so rashly.
You know Daddy didn't mean it.

1:08:59.870 --> 1:09:01.569
Stop defending him all the time.

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.873
Look, I know that he crossed
the line this time,

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:07.475
but if you stay,
we can try to work it out.

1:09:07.477 --> 1:09:10.445
Honestly, Carol, I don't know
how you've put up with him
for this long.

1:09:15.318 --> 1:09:17.385
Sasha, this was supposed
to be my last year.

1:09:18.788 --> 1:09:21.756
-What are you talking about?
-I've been wanting
to leave for some time now,

1:09:21.758 --> 1:09:25.493
but Dad convinced me to stay
and help you get through
the year first.

1:09:25.495 --> 1:09:27.896
[sighs] What is this,
some daughter swap program?

1:09:28.465 --> 1:09:31.566
Look, if you leave now,
then I will really be
stuck here forever.

1:09:31.568 --> 1:09:36.638
Carol, look, I'm sorry that
Dad has manipulated you for
the past ten years.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.676
I'm sorry you think you can't
leave unless I stay, but you're
a grown woman.

1:09:41.678 --> 1:09:44.579
Stop asking everyone for
permission on how
to live your life.

1:09:47.417 --> 1:09:50.552
You don't think that I wanted
to have my own life too?

1:09:50.554 --> 1:09:52.654
But Dad needed help.
So I stepped up.

1:09:52.656 --> 1:09:54.889
I put ten years of my life
into this family business.

1:09:54.891 --> 1:09:57.492
-It's time that
you contributed too.
-I came back, didn't I?

1:09:57.494 --> 1:10:00.195
Only after I convinced
Dad to cut you off.

1:10:03.433 --> 1:10:04.532
Wait, what?

1:10:06.203 --> 1:10:08.670
I'm sorry, Sasha. It was
the only way to get you
to come back.

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:11.739
How could you do that to me?

1:10:11.741 --> 1:10:15.877
I just wanted you to see
what it was like for me
for the last ten years.

1:10:16.546 --> 1:10:18.980
Do you know how hard I worked
while you just partied away

1:10:18.982 --> 1:10:22.317
all that hard-earned cash,
money that I helped Dad make?

1:10:22.886 --> 1:10:25.353
It is not fair, Sasha.

1:10:25.355 --> 1:10:28.656
Dad threatened to disown me
if I didn't come back
and work for him,

1:10:28.658 --> 1:10:31.859
but he let you just stay in L.A.
and do whatever you wanted?

1:10:32.562 --> 1:10:36.331
-He's always loved you more.
-Oh, my god, Carol, get over it.

1:10:36.933 --> 1:10:39.300
He's a shitty Dad to me too.

1:10:40.503 --> 1:10:42.570
I have never once
tried to compete with you.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:46.241
I would never try
to sabotage you like this.

1:10:48.311 --> 1:10:49.944
You know what the sad thing is?

1:10:49.946 --> 1:10:54.382
I thought getting reacquainted
with you is the best part of
this whole experience.

1:10:55.585 --> 1:10:58.853
I didn't realize I was just
a part of your sick little
revenge plot.

1:11:04.661 --> 1:11:06.661
Sasha, that's not
what I intended at all.

1:11:06.663 --> 1:11:09.297
Well, Dad's all yours again.

1:11:09.299 --> 1:11:11.866
Have fun taking care of him
for the next ten years.

1:11:12.502 --> 1:11:14.836
I'll just get out
of the way so you can
be his favorite daughter.

[sobbing]

1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.620
Hey, Sasha, where are you going?

1:11:33.790 --> 1:11:36.524
-I'm, uh, going back to America.
-For how long?

1:11:36.993 --> 1:11:37.959
For a while.

1:11:38.728 --> 1:11:40.561
You're not coming back, are you?

1:11:42.299 --> 1:11:45.767
-I'm sorry.
-We're gonna miss you.

1:11:46.770 --> 1:11:48.436
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:52.073
I'm very sorry, but I gotta go.

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:02.517
[melancholic music]

1:12:53.370 --> 1:12:57.638
I brought food for you.
You must be starving.

1:12:58.541 --> 1:13:02.510
-Hmm. How long was I out?
-You've been sleeping all day.

1:13:03.646 --> 1:13:06.614
-How do you feel?
-Tired.

1:13:07.884 --> 1:13:09.751
And like I let everyone down.

1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:12.887
Oh, honey. Don't blame yourself.

1:13:13.456 --> 1:13:15.022
Your father has no filter.

1:13:15.792 --> 1:13:20.428
-He always talks
without thinking first.
-I know.

1:13:21.798 --> 1:13:23.164
But also the workers.

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:27.402
I mean, because of me none of
them are going to be able
to go home.

1:13:27.871 --> 1:13:29.771
If there's one thing I learned

1:13:29.773 --> 1:13:31.672
from being married
to your father,

1:13:32.509 --> 1:13:36.811
it's that despite
all his flaws, down deep, deep

1:13:36.813 --> 1:13:39.180
deep down inside,

1:13:39.182 --> 1:13:41.716
he really does have
a kind heart.

1:13:42.919 --> 1:13:44.919
He won't let the workers suffer.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.788
He'll figure out
a way to pay them.

1:13:47.157 --> 1:13:48.122
I hope so.

1:13:49.859 --> 1:13:52.627
-You know what's weird, Mom?
-What?

1:13:52.996 --> 1:13:55.129
I actually kind of liked China.

1:13:56.966 --> 1:14:01.002
-I know.
-And now I don't know
what I'm gonna do next.

1:14:01.805 --> 1:14:04.172
You just got back.
Give yourself a break.

1:14:04.874 --> 1:14:07.575
You'll figure out
your next steps soon enough.

1:14:09.512 --> 1:14:10.511
Yeah.

1:15:15.278 --> 1:15:16.878
Uh, what are you doing
with these?

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.913
They're being recalled
for safety issues.

1:15:19.883 --> 1:15:23.985
-So, what happens to them now?
-Going into the dumpster.

1:15:23.987 --> 1:15:26.754
Really? But so much
work went into them.

1:15:26.756 --> 1:15:28.556
Yeah. I'm just following orders.

1:15:30.093 --> 1:15:31.726
Can I buy them from you?

1:15:32.295 --> 1:15:33.261
Umm...

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:36.063
-Yeah, have them.
-Really?

1:15:36.065 --> 1:15:38.566
-Yeah. Happy holidays.
-Thanks.

[phone rings]

1:16:42.699 --> 1:16:47.101
Now that we have lost Dahlia's,
we need to secure new accounts,

1:16:47.103 --> 1:16:49.737
even if we have
to lose money doing it.

1:16:49.739 --> 1:16:51.772
Once they are loyal
we've got them.

1:16:52.609 --> 1:16:54.141
That's the way you do it.

1:16:54.143 --> 1:16:58.045
Problem with you,
you never listen to me.

1:16:58.047 --> 1:17:00.648
You always cook too high.

1:17:01.017 --> 1:17:02.917
We can't survive like that.

1:17:02.919 --> 1:17:06.754
Soon everyone will be going to
Indonesia to buy their toys.

1:17:06.756 --> 1:17:07.722
Dad...

1:17:09.158 --> 1:17:12.026
Can we ever talk about anything
other than just business?

1:17:12.028 --> 1:17:13.661
[background chatter]

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:19.934
Have you spoken
to Sasha at home?

1:17:22.338 --> 1:17:23.404
Yeah.

1:17:23.406 --> 1:17:27.642
I worked so hard to give
you girls the good life.

1:17:28.911 --> 1:17:31.846
It's not appreciated.
You just complain

1:17:31.848 --> 1:17:34.015
I don't spend
enough time with you

1:17:34.017 --> 1:17:36.884
and run off
at the first small row.

1:17:37.654 --> 1:17:40.321
I don't understand why
I do this for my family.

1:17:42.058 --> 1:17:44.325
Maybe you shouldn't be
mixing family with business.

1:17:46.896 --> 1:17:50.331
The family was the reason
I started the business.

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.667
You can keep telling
yourself that

1:17:52.669 --> 1:17:55.403
but you did it
because you were ambitious.

1:17:55.405 --> 1:17:58.906
No, I was fulfilling
my responsibilities.

1:17:59.942 --> 1:18:02.410
You want to talk about
responsibility to the family?

1:18:03.846 --> 1:18:04.779
Well...

1:18:05.448 --> 1:18:07.081
How about, don't cheat?

1:18:08.084 --> 1:18:10.985
How about, don't have a daughter

1:18:10.987 --> 1:18:13.220
with another woman
when you already have one?

1:18:14.257 --> 1:18:16.891
How about, don't abandon
your family in the first place?

1:18:18.261 --> 1:18:20.394
I never abandoned you.

1:18:20.396 --> 1:18:23.431
You moved another woman
into our home

1:18:23.433 --> 1:18:25.733
and you had a baby with her.

1:18:25.735 --> 1:18:27.835
Do you have any idea
how that made me feel?

1:18:28.938 --> 1:18:31.105
My entire life I have felt like

1:18:31.107 --> 1:18:34.442
-I am second best to Sasha.
-But that's not true.

1:18:34.444 --> 1:18:36.210
You are my first child.

1:18:36.212 --> 1:18:38.345
Nobody can ever take your place.

1:18:38.347 --> 1:18:40.781
You told me that
you would disown me

1:18:40.783 --> 1:18:42.216
if I didn't come back
and work for you,

1:18:42.218 --> 1:18:44.351
but you let Sasha
do whatever she wanted.

1:18:44.353 --> 1:18:48.489
Only because I expected
so much more from you.

1:18:48.491 --> 1:18:51.892
I have always thought
you'd be the one to take over.

1:18:52.328 --> 1:18:53.260
Dad...

1:18:53.262 --> 1:18:56.831
I want to go back to
just being your daughter.

1:18:57.133 --> 1:18:59.333
You are my daughter.
What are you talking about?

1:18:59.335 --> 1:19:02.136
No, I'm your employee.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:08.943
I've been your employee first
for the last ten years,
and I'm tired of it.

1:19:08.945 --> 1:19:12.113
I don't want our only
conversation to be
about business.

1:19:12.115 --> 1:19:15.282
I came back because I wanted
to make up for lost time.

1:19:15.952 --> 1:19:19.220
But I think it actually might be
better for our relationship

1:19:19.222 --> 1:19:21.155
if we don't work
together anymore.

1:19:22.925 --> 1:19:25.392
Our business is
a family business.

1:19:26.062 --> 1:19:27.194
No.

1:19:27.196 --> 1:19:30.965
It's your business, your family
owes you absolutely nothing.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:35.970
I think you can think of
a qualified person or two
to hand it over to.

1:19:38.107 --> 1:19:39.073
[sighs]

1:19:51.420 --> 1:19:52.520
Girl.

1:19:55.091 --> 1:19:56.991
Why have you been ignoring us?

1:19:59.061 --> 1:20:00.995
[Sasha] I'm sorry
I've been MIA.

1:20:01.397 --> 1:20:03.464
I've just been too embarrassed
to get in touch

1:20:03.466 --> 1:20:05.499
after everything
that happened in China.

1:20:05.501 --> 1:20:09.136
These are so adorable. I can't
believe that you designed them.

1:20:09.138 --> 1:20:11.438
Yeah, Sasha, you should be
really proud of yourself.

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:14.942
I mean, look at these sketches.
They're, they're really good.

1:20:14.944 --> 1:20:16.577
I mean, none of it
matters anyway.

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:18.979
Because I insisted on
using that stupid scarf,

1:20:18.981 --> 1:20:21.182
they're all just gonna
end up in the dumpster.

1:20:21.184 --> 1:20:22.883
And my father's company
is blacklisted

1:20:22.885 --> 1:20:25.586
and his workers are
losing their bonuses.

1:20:25.588 --> 1:20:28.322
That's not right.
I mean, if the scarf is

1:20:28.324 --> 1:20:30.424
the only issue,
why don't they just cut it off?

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:34.061
Yeah, just do that and then--
I don't know,

1:20:34.063 --> 1:20:35.963
at least donate them
or something.

1:20:35.965 --> 1:20:38.332
Yes. So many kids would
want one. I want one.

1:20:38.334 --> 1:20:40.134
But it's their corporate policy.

1:20:40.136 --> 1:20:41.936
So like what can I do about it?

1:20:45.508 --> 1:20:46.507
[sighs]

1:20:52.014 --> 1:20:57.451
You know, my niece's best friend
is this really huge toy
influencer on YouTube.

1:20:57.453 --> 1:21:00.254
She's eight years old and she's
got like ten million followers.

1:21:03.226 --> 1:21:04.926
-Damn.
-Wow.

1:21:04.927 --> 1:21:06.627
Do you think if she reviewed
them that would change things?

1:21:06.629 --> 1:21:08.996
Oh, yes, a hundred percent.
I mean one review from her

1:21:08.998 --> 1:21:10.598
and every kid in America
is going to want your toy.

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:12.299
And then Dahlia's
will have no choice

1:21:12.301 --> 1:21:14.134
but to keep these on the shelfs.

1:21:14.136 --> 1:21:16.937
Girl, we are totally going
to get you out of this mess.

1:21:16.939 --> 1:21:18.405
Oh, my god,
that would be amazing.

1:21:18.407 --> 1:21:20.074
I'm gonna message her right now.

1:21:20.076 --> 1:21:22.476
Girl, what are friends for, um?

1:21:22.478 --> 1:21:24.511
We're gonna have to cut
off so many scarves.

1:21:24.513 --> 1:21:26.380
-So many scarves.
-[laughter]

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:30.551
The week your collection
was set to be recalled,

1:21:30.553 --> 1:21:33.520
we suddenly got bombarded
with calls for them.

1:21:33.522 --> 1:21:37.491
That's quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

1:21:38.895 --> 1:21:40.594
Hmm. I guess it is.

1:21:41.197 --> 1:21:43.230
So, after much
internal discussion,

1:21:43.232 --> 1:21:45.399
we've decided to put
them back on our shelves.

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:48.102
-Really?
-Not doing so is creating

1:21:48.104 --> 1:21:50.371
a whole new set
of PR problems for us.

1:21:51.073 --> 1:21:54.675
But we still do have
an obligation to ensure
our customers' safety.

1:21:54.677 --> 1:21:58.212
-So, we've decided to cut off
all the scarves.
-Of course.

1:21:58.214 --> 1:22:01.649
I trust that you will take care
of the labor and retest fee?

1:22:01.651 --> 1:22:03.517
I'm sure we can
work something out.

1:22:05.154 --> 1:22:06.954
[Dahlia] It's been really good
seeing you again.

1:22:06.956 --> 1:22:09.256
[Sasha] Yes, thank you
for having me.

1:22:09.258 --> 1:22:13.327
-Listen, I heard what happened
between you and your dad.
-Yeah.

1:22:13.930 --> 1:22:17.197
-I really hope you two
can work things out.
-Me too.

1:22:17.967 --> 1:22:20.301
But if you are looking for work,

1:22:20.303 --> 1:22:22.536
I think we may have
something for you.

1:22:23.673 --> 1:22:26.407
-Really?
-Yeah, we could use someone

1:22:26.409 --> 1:22:29.109
with your design
and manufacturing experience.

1:22:30.713 --> 1:22:34.581
-Just think about it.
-I will. Thank you.

-What are you doing here?
-Sorry to barge in
on you like this,

1:23:31.574 --> 1:23:34.641
but I had a stopover
and thought I'd get in touch.

1:23:36.345 --> 1:23:38.012
Do you want to grab lunch?

1:23:40.116 --> 1:23:43.217
Um, yeah, let me
just grab my stuff.

1:23:44.286 --> 1:23:46.320
-[soft music]
-[background chatter]

1:23:47.356 --> 1:23:51.692
-So Dahlia's, huh?
-Yeah, it was a surprise
to me too.

1:23:53.029 --> 1:23:55.429
It's pretty cool you were able
to save the order.

1:23:56.332 --> 1:23:59.700
That's the least I could do
after I screwed everything up.

1:24:01.303 --> 1:24:05.072
-Do you like it there?
-Yeah, actually I do.

1:24:05.741 --> 1:24:09.209
I guess I had to go back
to China to finally land
a job here.

1:24:10.046 --> 1:24:12.713
I'm glad something good came
out of that whole experience.

1:24:13.482 --> 1:24:16.450
Yeah, I guess I have you
to thank for that, right?

1:24:17.353 --> 1:24:22.756
Sasha, I'm so sorry
about... everything.

1:24:23.459 --> 1:24:27.628
It's fine. I'm sorry too
for the way we ended things.

1:24:28.531 --> 1:24:30.831
Can we just go back to
the way that things were?

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:32.266
Yeah, of course.

1:24:35.137 --> 1:24:36.303
So, um--

1:24:36.305 --> 1:24:40.741
-I finally left the company.
-Oh, my god, what happened?

1:24:40.743 --> 1:24:44.611
You were right. It's time for me
to do something for myself
for a change.

1:24:45.181 --> 1:24:50.184
-Good for you.
How is Dad taking it?
-Surprisingly well,

1:24:50.186 --> 1:24:54.221
but I do feel bad
leaving him behind like this

1:24:54.223 --> 1:24:56.690
when the company's
at an all-time low.

1:24:56.692 --> 1:25:00.127
And then almost losing
their bonus, really put
everyone on edge.

1:25:00.129 --> 1:25:02.696
I'm afraid that a lot of people
aren't going to return in
the New Year.

1:25:03.833 --> 1:25:06.366
And Dad will really be
screwed next year.

1:25:11.207 --> 1:25:13.674
-Well, it was so good
seeing you.
-Yeah, you too.

1:25:13.676 --> 1:25:17.144
-What are your plans now?
-I have absolutely no idea.

1:25:17.146 --> 1:25:19.246
And I wouldn't
have it any other way.

1:25:19.248 --> 1:25:20.614
I'm really happy for you.

1:25:22.451 --> 1:25:24.451
-Take care of yourself.
-You too.

1:25:24.453 --> 1:25:25.686
[both grunting]

1:25:27.356 --> 1:25:28.722
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:25:39.435 --> 1:25:41.902
[lively music]

1:25:49.678 --> 1:25:51.245
[machines hissing]

1:26:13.936 --> 1:26:16.937
Sasha, what are you doing here?

1:26:16.939 --> 1:26:22.376
Uh, on a pre sourcing trip with
Dahlia's. I thought I'd stop by.

1:26:22.378 --> 1:26:25.612
Ah, yes, I heard you got
the job. Congratulations.

1:26:26.515 --> 1:26:27.548
Thank you.

1:26:30.452 --> 1:26:34.454
-I'm sorry that
I ran out like that.
-Oh, no, I should be sorry.

1:26:34.456 --> 1:26:36.490
I should never
have said those things.

1:26:36.492 --> 1:26:40.694
-I didn't mean them, but I'm
sure you understand.
-I do.

1:26:42.298 --> 1:26:45.332
So I heard morale has not
been high at the factory.

1:26:45.334 --> 1:26:48.569
They got their bonus back.
They were there.

1:26:48.571 --> 1:26:51.338
I have an idea for
how we could boost morale.

1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:54.341
You want to add dessert
to their lunch now?

1:26:54.877 --> 1:26:57.678
Why don't we provide
on-site childcare

1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:00.948
-so they don't ever have to
leave their kids behind again?
-With what money?

1:27:01.750 --> 1:27:04.451
-My trust fund.
-Oh, no, that's ridiculous.

1:27:04.453 --> 1:27:06.386
That money is for your future.

1:27:06.822 --> 1:27:09.923
I don't deserve that money.
They do.

1:27:09.925 --> 1:27:12.526
They've worked much harder
and much longer than I have.

1:27:12.528 --> 1:27:14.828
They shouldn't have to only
see their kids once a year.

1:27:15.331 --> 1:27:18.565
-Yeah, but this is
business, not personal.
-It's personal for them.

1:27:18.567 --> 1:27:21.969
They're hard-working people
just trying to support
their families,

1:27:21.971 --> 1:27:24.638
and that's how
you started, remember?

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:26.873
And you were able to
achieve that pretty quickly.

1:27:26.875 --> 1:27:29.343
But then you wanted more,
you wanted the nicer car,

1:27:29.345 --> 1:27:31.378
the bigger house,
the younger wife.

1:27:31.814 --> 1:27:34.381
When is it ever enough?
Especially when the people

1:27:34.383 --> 1:27:36.683
who got you here
can barely make ends meet.

1:27:37.353 --> 1:27:39.953
All they want is a chance
to provide for their kids.

1:27:40.589 --> 1:27:43.023
They shouldn't have to
sacrifice their families
in order to do it.

1:27:43.025 --> 1:27:46.660
[emotional music]

1:27:49.531 --> 1:27:50.631
You know what?

1:27:51.767 --> 1:27:54.601
You are stubborn
and hard-headed,

1:27:55.504 --> 1:27:59.640
but I have never felt more
proud of you than right now.

1:28:29.872 --> 1:28:32.072
[cheering]

1:28:43.819 --> 1:28:46.553
-So, Dahlia's, huh?
-Yeah.

1:28:47.723 --> 1:28:50.524
-Are you mad?
-No, I'm not mad.

1:28:50.993 --> 1:28:53.493
Okay, I thought you might be
cause I'm not helping out

1:28:53.495 --> 1:28:55.095
with the family
business anymore.

1:28:55.698 --> 1:28:57.798
I can still manage.

1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:00.067
Then why was it so important
for me to come back?

1:29:00.069 --> 1:29:02.602
All that talk about
giving back to the family.

1:29:03.639 --> 1:29:07.708
Oh, you think I made
you come back for me?

1:29:07.710 --> 1:29:11.411
-[scoffs] Yes.
-Oh, no, no. I made you
come back for you.

1:29:11.413 --> 1:29:13.714
Is so that I can
teach you business.

1:29:13.716 --> 1:29:15.649
So you can have work experience.

1:29:15.651 --> 1:29:19.619
That is more valuable than
any trust fund I can give you.

1:29:20.622 --> 1:29:24.024
Of course, I would like
to hand the company down
to you and Carol,

1:29:24.026 --> 1:29:28.395
but if you girls don't want
to do it, nothing I can do.

1:29:31.066 --> 1:29:34.000
So I was thinking maybe
I can help come up with

1:29:34.002 --> 1:29:36.436
toy ideas for you,
while I'm in L.A.

1:29:36.438 --> 1:29:39.973
-as a freelancer, you know?
-Is that what you want to do?

1:29:40.542 --> 1:29:43.143
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-What about your job?

1:29:43.712 --> 1:29:47.748
-I can always sketch after work.
-Well, that would be wonderful.

1:29:48.717 --> 1:29:51.685
-Nothing would make me happier.
-Oh, Dad.

1:29:54.890 --> 1:29:59.559
-So, is this a good time
to discuss my rate?
-Rate? What rate?

1:29:59.561 --> 1:30:01.395
What? You actually
want to be paid?

1:30:01.397 --> 1:30:03.897
-Dad, yes, of course
I wanna be paid.
-Oh, sorry.

1:30:03.899 --> 1:30:05.932
[Sasha] You just taught me
all I know about business.

1:30:05.934 --> 1:30:09.503
I don't work for free. L.A. is
very expensive, you know.

1:30:09.805 --> 1:30:12.773
In China fathers don't have
to pay daughters, okay?

1:30:12.775 --> 1:30:14.808
Yes, but I'm American.

1:30:15.677 --> 1:30:17.711
So I think you have to.

1:30:17.713 --> 1:30:20.847
[Dad] All in the family
and you have to pay each other.

1:30:20.849 --> 1:30:21.915
