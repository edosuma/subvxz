-[boy] Mr. Marcus Skinner,

Department, Stanford
University.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.583
Dear Mr. Skinner,

00:40.583 --> 00:46.291
my name is Shaun Brumder,
and I think you are
a total genius.

00:46.291 --> 00:50.417
I live in California,
in a place called
Orange County.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.792
[rock guitar music playing]

00:56.500 --> 00:59.000
A year ago,
I was just another
Orange County surfer,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.583
spending my days at the beach
with my buddies...

01:01.583 --> 01:04.625
-[grunts]
- playing volleyball...

01:05.625 --> 01:08.291
-[boy] Whack it, Shaun!
-Yeah!

01:08.291 --> 01:11.500
And spending my nights
around a bonfire, partying.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.125
School was always
a walk for me.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.792
I did pretty well,
without trying too hard.

01:18.792 --> 01:22.625
Hey brother, there's a tropical
storm three miles off Laguna.
Let's go, dude! Surf's up!

01:22.625 --> 01:25.333
-But I was easily distracted.
-What about next period?

01:25.333 --> 01:27.959
Twenty-footers, man!
Screw your period!

01:27.959 --> 01:29.333
Twenty-footers!

01:30.166 --> 01:32.542
Then, last April,

01:32.542 --> 01:35.625
me and my crew drove out
to Emerald Cove

01:35.625 --> 01:38.291
to catch some major
tsunami waves.

01:38.291 --> 01:40.542
[roaring, thundering]

01:49.000 --> 01:51.041

-But I bet he's up

-After Lonny drowned,

02:32.667 --> 02:35.542
I did some heavy meditating--
I thought,

"Maybe there's more to life
than extreme sports
and trying to get laid.

02:40.542 --> 02:42.709
Maybe there's a bigger
purpose for me,

too high to figure it out."

02:45.709 --> 02:49.417
I was sitting on the beach,
totally cogitating.

02:49.417 --> 02:52.417
I looked down,
and there, in the sand,

02:52.417 --> 02:54.583
was a copy of your book.

02:54.583 --> 02:57.583

was calling out to me.

02:59.625 --> 03:02.208
[deep male voice]
"Read me."

03:02.208 --> 03:05.917
For the next few days,
I read it from cover to cover.

03:05.917 --> 03:09.792
Your book totally
captured what's it's like
to be a teenager.

03:09.792 --> 03:13.917
The excitement,
the confusion, the horniness.

03:13.917 --> 03:18.083
Sometimes I laughed so hard,
I thought I was going
to puke and die.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.458
And other times, I cried.

03:23.875 --> 03:29.917
-Shaun?
Are you okay?
-It's just so sad!

03:29.917 --> 03:32.792
I read your book
52 times that month,

03:32.792 --> 03:37.458
and I finally realized
what I wanted to do
with my life:

03:37.458 --> 03:40.583
I want to be a writer.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.625
I've been writing ever since.
It's all I ever do.

All day and all night,

03:46.417 --> 03:49.583
It was hard to get going,
but once I did,
[muttering]

03:49.583 --> 03:50.875
I couldn't stop.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.667
I'm like a machine,
and nothing else matters.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.917
Guys,
I'm sellin' my board.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.458
-Dude! No.
-I don't have time to surf.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.458
-I need to focus on my writing.
-Huh? What?

04:01.458 --> 04:04.125

I've lost my mind.

04:04.125 --> 04:09.125
-He's lost his mind.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.667

I need some feedback,
and there's no one
here to help me.

04:15.542 --> 04:18.000
Got your story here,
Shaun. Wow.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.666
I had the sneaking suspicion
that my English teacher
is illiterate.

04:21.666 --> 04:24.500
Uh, I noticed you used
a lot of big words.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.834
Nice. Good for you.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.000
It was a little long,
so I didn't read
the whole thing,

'cause I gave you an A.

My girlfriend is the only one
who's actually read my work,

04:49.333 --> 04:53.041

so positive, it's hard
to take her seriously.

04:53.041 --> 04:57.875
-It's like the best story
I've ever read.
-Really?

It's funny and original.

it could be a movie.

[people shouting,

05:15.542 --> 05:19.583
I don't know if Orange
County's the best environment
for an aspiring writer.

05:19.583 --> 05:23.208
So I'm applying to Stanford,
to study with you.

05:23.208 --> 05:26.875
-You are a shoo-in.
-[chuckling, stammering]

05:26.875 --> 05:29.542

to some safety schools?

05:29.542 --> 05:32.166
No need.
Don't you be a scaredy-cat.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.625
There's no doubt
in my mind that you're
gonna go to Berkeley.

05:35.625 --> 05:39.917
-Stanford.
-Yes, Stanford is where
you're going, mister.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.709
I'm sending you
a copy of my story.

05:43.709 --> 05:46.291
Hopefully, with
your wisdom and guidance,

05:46.291 --> 05:49.458
I will one day
be a real writer.

it's "stop the press."

do something.

-In his memory.
-Yeah.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.166
We should pull a killer prank.
We should go jump off
something, dudes.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.625
Yeah, bro,
or blow something up.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.333
Maybe we should go on down to
Emerald Cove and have a little
surf in Lonny's memory.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.834
Dude, Shaun doesn't
surf anymore, stupid.

10:10.834 --> 10:15.000

says hundreds of seagulls
have been affected.

So I propose a school-sponsored
fund-raiser

-Fine.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.750

-You know how you told me
that every night

you'd pray that you'd
get into Stanford?

I prayed for something too.

That you wouldn't
get into Stanford.

it was gonna work!

was answered.

And I should be happy."

24:01.875 --> 24:03.667
and now maybe you can
go to OCU too.

24:03.667 --> 24:08.000
And you can study creative
writing, and I can study marine
biology, and we can be together.

feeling really guilty.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.208
I mean, this was your dream.

Yeah, that's right, Lupe.
Just cover his whole head.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.792
Who are you?

26:54.792 --> 26:57.166
I'm your wife.
Cindy?

26:57.166 --> 27:00.333
-We met in Maui?
Hey, Shaun, look!
-[door opens]

27:00.333 --> 27:02.500
-Bob's still bleeding.
-[mumbling]

27:02.500 --> 27:05.834
-What's this? Ow, what is--
Oh, my God!
-[panting]

27:05.834 --> 27:09.041
[chuckling]
Oh, he likes you.
Yes!

27:09.041 --> 27:11.542
-We found him on PCH.
Um-hmm.
-Get him out of the house.

27:11.542 --> 27:14.875
-I don't allow dogs in here.
-Oh, but he's so swee--

27:14.875 --> 27:19.083
-[chuckles fondly]
-Call the humane society.
They'll have him put to sleep.

27:19.083 --> 27:22.542
Hey, Ash, don't you think
we should put out some cheese
and crackers or something?

27:22.542 --> 27:25.834
-God, they're gonna be here
in, like, 15 minutes.
-Yeah, I know.

27:25.834 --> 27:29.041
-Wh-who's coming?
-Mom, you--

27:29.041 --> 27:31.166
You might want to
put on something more--

27:32.000 --> 27:35.083
-You know.
-More what?

27:35.083 --> 27:38.417
More what?
What's going on?

27:40.041 --> 27:42.875
Shaun, what's going--
What's happening?

27:42.875 --> 27:45.583
[stammering]
Okay. Sit down.
Sit down. Okay?

27:45.583 --> 27:47.542
Just sit.
Don't be nervous,

27:47.542 --> 27:50.041
but someone very important
is coming over to the house.

27:50.041 --> 27:54.583
And he's bringing his wife.
And if he likes me, he's
gonna get me into Stanford.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.417
-Are they coming over now?
-Yeah. They're gonna be here
in a couple of minutes.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.750
Shaun,
the house is a mess.

27:59.750 --> 28:04.417
And Bob is bleeding.
And you cannot expect me
to drop everything I'm doing

28:04.417 --> 28:05.959
and just entertain
these strangers!

28:05.959 --> 28:07.917
Drop what?
What were you doing?

28:07.917 --> 28:10.458
-Uh, I--
-Look,

28:10.458 --> 28:13.917
This is my last chance
to get into Stanford.

28:13.917 --> 28:17.208
I know, honey, and--
it's not a good day for me.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.291
-But I have to go to college!
-Why?

28:19.291 --> 28:22.125
Because that's what you do
after high school!

28:22.125 --> 28:24.875
Please don't do this to me,
all right?

28:24.875 --> 28:28.291
Please don't sabotage me,
because every time I try
to depend on you,

28:28.291 --> 28:33.333
-you start acting like
a total lunatic!
-[gasps] Oh, Shaun.

28:34.792 --> 28:37.083
[sighing, whimpering]

28:40.083 --> 28:41.166
Mom?

28:43.750 --> 28:47.291
Mom?
I'm sorry.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.250
So, uh-- so now
I'm a bad mother?

28:49.250 --> 28:52.625
No. No, you're not.
Will you please just
put on some clothes?

28:52.625 --> 28:55.500
I sacrificed
a lot for you, Shaun.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.917
I sacrificed Damian
for you.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.458
-Your tennis instructor?
-He was beautiful!

29:00.458 --> 29:04.333
And Serbian.
And when your father left,
I almost married him.

29:04.333 --> 29:08.667
And if I had, we'd be living
in a condo clipping coupons
and eating lunch meat.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.625
So, I didn't.
I married Bob!

29:11.625 --> 29:16.125
For you.
I had sex with Bob.
Four times. For you!

29:16.125 --> 29:18.375
So how can you say
I'm a bad mother?

29:18.375 --> 29:22.667
I'm not saying that.
Mom, you know that
money can't buy happiness.

29:22.667 --> 29:24.333
Oh, grow up.
Yes, it can!

29:24.333 --> 29:29.166
-You and dad both have money,
and you're both miserable.
-He's miserable?

29:29.166 --> 29:32.834
-Shaun, did he say that?
-Mom,

29:32.834 --> 29:35.000
this is the most decisive day
of my life.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.750
And all I am asking for
is one hour.

29:36.750 --> 29:41.542
One hour w-with no big scenes,
and no nervous breakdowns
and no Meryl Streep impressions.

29:41.542 --> 29:46.667
Just one hour where
you act like a normal,
loving parent.

29:46.667 --> 29:49.542
-Can you do this for me?
-[sighing ] Oh, Shaun.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.709
[laughs]
Yes, I can.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.417
[sighs]
Thank you, Mom.

29:57.417 --> 30:00.375
But I'll need a glass of wine.
There's some chardonnay
in the fridge.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.083
O-o-okay!

30:02.083 --> 30:04.041
I'll be right back.
Don't move!

30:09.375 --> 30:12.333
-Oh, Ash, I am
really nervous.
-Don't be.

30:12.333 --> 30:15.041
-Everything's gonna be fine!
-[doorbell rings]

30:15.041 --> 30:17.041
[scoffs]
They're early!

30:17.667 --> 30:20.250
Lance. Lance!

30:20.250 --> 30:23.834
Some very important people
are coming over to the house,
so stay in your room.

30:23.834 --> 30:25.834
-Why?
-Because you're
an embarrassment.

30:25.834 --> 30:28.166
-Oh, okay.
-[chuckles]

30:29.250 --> 30:32.041
-"Shaun."
-Shaun.
Shaun.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.250
-Mom, they're here!
-I- I look like a pinata.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.250
Yeah, you look great.
Just remember what I said.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.625
No big drunken scenes,
okay?

30:45.917 --> 30:49.875
-[sighing] Yeah.
-Okay, Lupe is with Bob.
Lance is in his room...

30:49.875 --> 30:51.792
And mom is dressed.

30:51.792 --> 30:54.583
-How do I look?
-Very handsome.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.875
-[doorbell rings again]
-Now just be yourself.

30:57.875 --> 31:00.709
-Okay. Okay.
Come on!
-Okay.

31:04.792 --> 31:09.417
-You must be Shaun.
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
Mr. Gantner. Please come in.

31:09.417 --> 31:12.417
Mrs. Gantner.
Thank you so much
for coming.

31:12.417 --> 31:15.375
-This is my girlfriend,
uh, Ashley.
-Hi.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.458
-Hello, Ashley.
-Nice to meet you.

31:17.458 --> 31:21.291
-You're friends with Tanya.
-Tanya's very upset
by your situation.

31:21.291 --> 31:23.625
I don't like it when
my granddaughter is upset.
[chuckles]

31:23.625 --> 31:26.500
Tanya has Arthur wrapped
around her little finger.

31:26.500 --> 31:30.750
-That's right.
-Hello! Hello!

31:30.750 --> 31:35.291
Hello! Oops.
Hi, I'm Cindy Almond-Buegler.

31:35.291 --> 31:38.166
-Hello, I'm Arthur Gantner.
My wife, Vera.
-How do you do?

31:38.166 --> 31:40.792
Hello. Welcome!
[belches]

31:40.792 --> 31:42.667
[giggles]
Excuse me!

31:42.667 --> 31:45.583
[clears throat]
Won't you please, uh,
make yourselves at home.

31:45.583 --> 31:48.792
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

31:48.792 --> 31:51.583
Thank you.

31:51.583 --> 31:54.250
-So, Shaun, tell us
about yourself.
-Uh--

31:54.250 --> 31:57.291
Well, uh, I'm
a National Merit Scholar.

31:57.291 --> 32:00.000
Uh...
Straight "A" student,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.333
and I want
to be a writer.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.875
Do you like John Grisham?
I sure do.

32:05.875 --> 32:08.166
Shaun's also our
class president,

32:08.166 --> 32:11.500
and he was the representative
at our model UN.

32:11.500 --> 32:15.125
-Hmm!
-Yeah, he's a fabulous kid,
Mr. Gantner.

32:15.125 --> 32:17.125
Arthur, please.
Call me Arthur.
[ Chuckling ]

32:17.125 --> 32:23.166
Even as a little boy,
he was so  smart!
I miss those days.

32:23.166 --> 32:26.375
Yeah, the last few years
have been, um, really hard.

32:27.792 --> 32:30.667
Ah. Ahh !

32:30.667 --> 32:33.542
I helped my former husband
start his business.

32:33.542 --> 32:37.667
And as soon as he gets
a little money, he starts
screwin' around on me.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.500
-Oh, my goodness.
-Ahh.

32:39.500 --> 32:43.250
He left me for
a 20-year-old
he met at the gym.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.208
-[Vera] Oh!
-Yeah.

32:45.208 --> 32:48.917
I walked in on them
in a motel in La Jolla.
She's got him naked

32:48.917 --> 32:50.500
and handcuffed to the bed.

32:52.333 --> 32:56.041
So we divorced,
I remarried.

32:56.041 --> 32:59.667
Then, this new one,
uh, Bob,

32:59.667 --> 33:01.709
he starts
fallin' apart, and...

33:01.709 --> 33:06.875
Then it's just...
One shitstorm after
the other.

33:06.875 --> 33:09.667
-[doorbell ringing repeatedly]
-[boy] Shaun! Let us in!

33:09.667 --> 33:12.417
[shouting, pounding on door,
ringing continue]

33:12.417 --> 33:16.375
-[chuckling] Yo, bro!
-What's up, dude?

33:16.375 --> 33:18.375
-We heard you tried
to kill Mrs. Cobb.
-Shh!

33:18.375 --> 33:21.041
Yeah. Dude! Are you on
a violent rampage, dude?

33:21.041 --> 33:23.250
You guys,
what do you want?

33:23.250 --> 33:25.083
-All right.
-All right, bro.
Check it out.

33:25.083 --> 33:29.083
We thought, in Lonny's
memory, right? We could
go down to Emerald Cove,

33:29.083 --> 33:32.250
and we could take
his board, and we could
like, push it

33:32.250 --> 33:34.792
-out into the ocean.
-Yeah.
Or blow it up.

33:34.792 --> 33:36.709
-Right.
-Dudes, it sounds like
a great idea, all right?

33:36.709 --> 33:40.750
And I'll do it, but I can't
right now, because I got some
very important people over.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.583
-So--
-Whoa.

33:42.583 --> 33:45.417
-More important
than us,  huh?
-No.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.917
-More important than Lonny?
-Of course not.

33:47.917 --> 33:50.750
-Yeah, right, bro.
This is his birthday, man.
-Yeah, man.

33:50.750 --> 33:54.750
Like his "death-birthday."
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.750
You know what?
Just go hang with your
little "vips," all right?

33:56.750 --> 33:58.959
That's right, man.
Sorry we intruded
on your tea party.

33:58.959 --> 34:02.250
-[board clatters]
-Yeah, if you need us,
we'll be out in the van.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.750
-Pickin' each other's butts.
Naked.
-Yeah.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.625
-Huh?
-[door opens, slams]

34:11.625 --> 34:14.833
So I, uh, I visited
Stanford in the fall.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.250
-It's a beautiful campus.
-Isn't it lovely?

34:17.250 --> 34:21.125
We go up there for
football games, and of course,
Arthur is on the board!

34:21.125 --> 34:24.500
-So, uh--
-Excuse me. Sorry.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.500
Shaun, have
you seen my piss?

34:26.500 --> 34:29.458
My parole officer called.
He wants that piss.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.291
'Cause man, I know
I got it around here.

34:31.291 --> 34:34.333
Lance, don't you see
that we have company?

34:34.333 --> 34:37.000
Oh, hey, what's up?
Oh, there it is!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.333
[gags, shrieks]

34:39.333 --> 34:43.083
-Ah! Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Okay, look.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.250
Somebody's going
to fill this up,
or I'm going to jail.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.875
-All right?
-[whispering ] Will you
just get out of here?

34:47.875 --> 34:51.667
-[inhales deeply] Fine!
-[specimen cup clattering]

34:57.834 --> 34:59.834
I'd like to "protose"
a toast.

35:00.834 --> 35:03.542
Shaun has been
a wonderful son.

35:04.792 --> 35:07.041
And I want him
to be happy!

35:07.834 --> 35:10.208
[sobbing]

35:10.208 --> 35:12.375
I'm going to be all alone!

35:12.375 --> 35:16.500
-Hey! Hey!
-Uh!

35:16.500 --> 35:19.041
-Dear god!
-Pills!

35:19.041 --> 35:23.542
Mom, you didn't give
Bob his medication.
Excuse me for a minute.

-[vacuum cleaner whirring]
-Dude! Dude!

35:27.458 --> 35:29.041
-Dude!
-[switches off motor]

35:29.041 --> 35:34.041
-Where are Bob's pain pills?
-[karate yell]

35:36.208 --> 35:39.083
-No, this is Excedrin.
-It's a decoy.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.875
I put my stash
in aspirin bottles.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.709
Yellow are painkillers.
They go in Excedrin.

35:43.709 --> 35:47.834
Lance,
listen to me, all right?
I need Bob's pain pills.

35:47.834 --> 35:50.041
-Bob doesn't have any
pain pills. I sold 'em.
-Yes he does.

35:50.041 --> 35:52.875
-But these are good.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
-What?

35:52.875 --> 35:55.667
Wait, uh, yellow are--

35:55.667 --> 35:57.709
Not pain killers,
what are they-- speed!

35:57.709 --> 36:00.542
No, they're the "x."
The painkillers are
in the Tylenol.

36:00.542 --> 36:03.500
-Give him one of these.
It'll knock him right out.
-Thanks.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.208
Wait. Please. Mr. Gantner,
where are you going?

36:10.208 --> 36:13.625
You people are sick.
Your mother's a drunk.
Your brother's a pervert.

36:13.625 --> 36:16.417
Shame on you for
abusing an old man!

36:16.417 --> 36:18.291
He's fine!
Tell them you're fine, Bob.

36:18.291 --> 36:23.083
-[high-pitched squealing]
-Look, I know how
this looks, all right?

36:23.083 --> 36:25.709
-But I do everything
I can for Bob.
-Um--

36:25.709 --> 36:28.375
-I love Bob!
-[yelling] Hey!

as long as I have a breath
in my body.

I got you, buddy.

You should sue, man.
This isn't right.
Sue the school.

38:18.917 --> 38:22.375
-Shut up, Lance.
-Or you know what?
Just go to Stanford anyway.

Go up there and take
the classes, don't take
"no" for an answer.

goin' here. Kiss my ass."

-he's gotta let me in.
-I can get you there
in three hours.

38:47.375 --> 38:50.250
You're gettin'
into Stanford, buddy.
I know it. I know it!

38:50.250 --> 38:51.542
Thanks, man.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.375
Have a question for you.
No. I got something to say.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.083
-[horn blaring]
-I'm gonna do something
with my life.

38:59.959 --> 39:03.125
-Yeah, man!
-Good.

39:03.125 --> 39:07.417
Dude, I get these ideas.
I got so many ideas
burnin' through my skull.

39:07.417 --> 39:11.083
Like, I don't know.
Like hats and shirts.
Like Stussy.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.750
Do you know what?
Stussy got started out
making

39:13.750 --> 39:16.041
hats and shirts
for surfers in Hawaii.

39:16.041 --> 39:19.959
Now he's like a millionaire.
He parties in Hawaii!
24/7, buddy!

39:19.959 --> 39:22.750
-I could do something like that.
Don't you think, Shaun?
-Yeah.

39:22.750 --> 39:25.583
Like a fuckin' shirt
that says, "loser!"

39:25.583 --> 39:28.125
Er, uh, I don't know--
[gibberish]

39:28.125 --> 39:30.750
"Talk to the hand."
Or something like that,
man.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.917
Those would sell.
Or I don't--
I got these ideas!

39:33.917 --> 39:36.709
Like a hat.
A big old hat that goes
[ascending scale]

39:36.709 --> 39:38.667
-You know?
-[both screaming]

39:38.667 --> 39:43.750
-[brakes screeching]
-[Lance] Watch the road,
dumb-ass.

39:43.750 --> 39:47.333
They've written me off, man.
Did you know that?
People have written me off.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.333
-Like Dad, for one.
-Hey, just keep
your eyes on the road.

39:51.625 --> 39:54.959
Dude, I'm gonna have
the last laugh.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.959
Because here's why.
Some little chumps
go to college.

39:57.959 --> 40:00.625
Some little chumps
stay home. Some little
chumps eat roast beef,

40:00.625 --> 40:04.291
And some little chumps have
none; but this little chump's
gonna cry, "Wee, wee, wee,"

40:04.291 --> 40:06.125
all the way
to the biz-neck.

40:06.125 --> 40:07.750
-You know
what I'm saying?
-Yeah. Yeah.

40:07.750 --> 40:11.667
-[screaming]
-[tires screeching,
engine revving]

40:11.667 --> 40:14.083
-[Lance] I love you, dude.
We don't say it enough.
-[Shaun] I love you too.

40:14.083 --> 40:17.959
We don't say it enough.
And it's true, and
it's not the drugs, buddy.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.542
-[door banging shut]
-Hi.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.750
-Hi.
-Uh, I need to talk...

40:49.750 --> 40:55.500
-to the dean of admissions.
-Well, it's 10:30 at night,
so he's not here right now.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.000
I-I know, but you see,
this is an emergency.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.709
Yeah, I'm sure.
You'll have to come back
tomorrow, though.

41:00.709 --> 41:05.542
-Could you maybe just
give us his phone number?
-What? His phone number?

41:05.542 --> 41:09.375
Please, you guys,
cut me some slack.
Come back tomorrow.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.875
All right,
we're closed,
okay?

41:11.875 --> 41:14.709
That's such crap.
That is such crap!

41:14.709 --> 41:17.917
Shaun, screw her.
You know what?
Screw her!

41:17.917 --> 41:20.875
-Are you cold?
Do you want my jacket?
-Yes, please. Thank you.

41:20.875 --> 41:25.208
[inhales sharply] Man!
She thinks she's so smart
'cause she goes to Stanford?

41:25.208 --> 41:28.417
Well, I'm smart too.
You watch, I'm gonna
pull a Macgyver.

41:28.417 --> 41:33.041
I will break in a window,
I'll look around, and find a--
what do you call that thing?

41:33.041 --> 41:35.166
Directory! [snaps fingers]
You stay here.
I'm gonna be back

41:35.166 --> 41:37.542
in fifteen minutes
with the directory.

41:37.542 --> 41:38.875
Reconnoiter, fifteen!

41:40.917 --> 41:43.959
Well, the dean's probably
listed. You could just
call information.

41:58.125 --> 42:00.458
-[shouting]
-[glass smashing]

42:00.458 --> 42:04.250
-[glass tinkling]
-[Lance groaning]

42:06.750 --> 42:10.250
[gasping]
Hey, what are you doing?

42:11.792 --> 42:14.542
Uh, hey...
Cutie.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.417
What do you want?

42:18.250 --> 42:22.250
Well, the question is,

42:24.625 --> 42:25.834
what do you  want?

42:29.792 --> 42:31.125
Listen, uh--

42:33.000 --> 42:34.792
Do you want me
to call public safety?

42:36.458 --> 42:38.750
Do you want me to get naked
and start the revolution?

42:44.291 --> 42:46.000
I'll take that
as a "maybe."

42:53.792 --> 42:55.458
[doorbell ringing]

42:58.000 --> 43:00.500
-Yes? Yeah?
-Hi, Mr. Durkett?

43:00.500 --> 43:03.959
-You're such a liar!
-Girls, Gina, Stephanie,
I told you knock it off.

43:03.959 --> 43:08.500
-Dad, Stephanie
stole my flip-flops.
-So deal with it, Gina.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.333
Go. Yes?

43:10.333 --> 43:14.000
Hi, I'm Shaun Brumder.
I need to talk to you
about my application.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.875
It's late.
I gotta get up
for a 7:00 flight.

43:16.875 --> 43:19.625
-But there's been
a big mistake.
-I'm sorry.

43:19.625 --> 43:21.875
There's nothing I can do.
Good night.

43:23.667 --> 43:27.291
-[ringing bell]
-Yes?

43:27.291 --> 43:31.458
Hi, Mr. Durkett.
Look, we drove all the way
here from Orange County.

43:31.458 --> 43:35.792
And can't you just give us
five minutes of your time?
Please?

43:36.834 --> 43:39.834
Okay, you have
five minutes. Go.

43:39.834 --> 43:43.500
Okay. Stanford University
was my first choice.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.500
All right? In fact,
I didn't even apply
to any other schools,

43:46.500 --> 43:50.208
but my college counselor
sent you the wrong transcript.

43:50.208 --> 43:53.667
-Show me your transcript.
-I left it in the car.
I'm just gonna go get it.

43:53.667 --> 43:56.041
It's just gonna
take two seconds.
Please don't go anywhere.

43:56.041 --> 43:58.834
-Okay.
-Don!

44:00.375 --> 44:01.875
-What?
-Where are
our bathing suits?

44:01.875 --> 44:05.208
There's a dive bag.
A green mesh dive bag
on the floor in my closet.

44:05.208 --> 44:08.667
-Just look in there.
-Who are these people?
Get rid of them?

44:12.375 --> 44:16.041
-Could I have one of those?
-Oh. Yeah.

44:16.041 --> 44:19.709
-Thank you.
My head is killing me.
-Oh, take two. Or three.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.583
Thank you.

44:21.583 --> 44:24.208
Yeah, or you can just
have the whole bottle.
[chuckles]

44:24.208 --> 44:26.250
-Thank you.
-[wife] When you're
done down there,

44:26.250 --> 44:28.542
I need help
closing my suitcase.

44:28.542 --> 44:31.250
Okay.
I'll be up
in five minutes.

44:35.917 --> 44:38.083
[doorbell ringing]

44:38.709 --> 44:39.917
[barking]

44:42.917 --> 44:45.250
-[ringing]
-Coming.

44:48.041 --> 44:49.917
Ah, come on.
[sighs]

44:49.917 --> 44:53.458
Jesus, you look like
a beast.

44:53.458 --> 44:56.417
-Where's Shaun?
I need to talk to him.
-He's driving to Stanford.

44:56.417 --> 44:58.417
He's having a crisis.
In case you didn't know.

44:58.417 --> 45:01.625
-I know all about it,
thank you.
-Yeah you're such a good father.

45:01.625 --> 45:07.417
-So good to your kids.
-[sighs] I need a drink.
Have any beer, coyote ugly?

45:10.417 --> 45:12.959
This is an excellent transcript.

45:12.959 --> 45:16.333
You should be very proud,
but what can I tell ya?
If I'd had this...

45:16.333 --> 45:19.291
By January 21st,
you might have had a shot,
but uh--

45:19.291 --> 45:23.333
-Don, I need you.
-[footsteps on stairs,
girls arguing]

45:23.333 --> 45:27.667
-Excuse me.
-[arguing continues]

45:27.667 --> 45:31.166
-[Don] All right, now
what is the big deal?
-He's gonna say no.

45:31.166 --> 45:35.000
Hey.
Don't let him say no.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.959
-It's gonna be fine.
-Okay.

45:38.125 --> 45:39.125
Thanks.

45:40.959 --> 45:43.959
So, what's up with
your brother and aspirin?

45:43.959 --> 45:46.625
Does he, like, get
a lot of headaches,
or what?

45:54.500 --> 45:57.500
What is that smell?
What am I sitting in?

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
Oh, relax.
It's just urine.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.542
Oh.

46:01.542 --> 46:05.000
[sighs deeply]
You know, your son was
being a real brat today.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.709
-A real pain in the ass.
- My  son.

46:07.709 --> 46:12.792
He said I was selfish.
He said that, "Everything's
always about me."

46:12.792 --> 46:15.834
Yeah, he called me
a drama queen. Said I was
trying to sabotage him.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.375
So, how's Bob?

46:25.375 --> 46:29.500
[chuckling]
How's what's-her-face?

46:31.166 --> 46:34.000
-She's sleeping around.
-[laughing] No!

46:34.000 --> 46:37.041
-[gasps]
-I can't talk to her.

46:37.041 --> 46:40.667
She doesn't play tennis.
She's not a good mother.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.166
She's not like you.

46:49.542 --> 46:51.083
Want another beer?

47:00.709 --> 47:01.875
Oh!

47:06.083 --> 47:11.208
Look, sometimes
I leave the office
at the end of the day,

47:11.208 --> 47:13.208
and I get into my car
and head home,

47:14.208 --> 47:16.041
and 15 minutes later,
I'm here.

47:16.041 --> 47:19.250
Parked in front of this house.
It's annoying.

47:19.250 --> 47:20.625
It's totally out of my way.
[sighs]

47:22.750 --> 47:26.291
I made a mistake and
I'm tired of paying for it.
I want you back.

47:28.583 --> 47:30.125
You're such an asshole.

47:33.542 --> 47:36.417
[moaning, groaning]

47:38.750 --> 47:42.041
-Which ones were they?
-Umm--

47:42.041 --> 47:44.959
-Excedrin?
-Excedrin.
Okay.

47:44.959 --> 47:47.417
Excedrin are...
pain pills!

47:47.417 --> 47:50.917
-Pain pills.
-No! Oh, my god!

47:50.917 --> 47:54.917
-What?
-We just gave the dean of
admissions three hits of--

48:01.000 --> 48:02.125
Where were we?

48:05.792 --> 48:07.959
Um--
[clicks tongue]

48:07.959 --> 48:11.291
Well, Mr. Durkett,
uh, to me,

48:11.291 --> 48:13.458
Stanford's not just
a school, it's--

48:13.458 --> 48:15.500
It's my entire
reason for living.

48:15.500 --> 48:19.667
Every night before
I went to bed, I'd pray
that I'd get into Stanford.

48:19.667 --> 48:25.000
And I worked really hard.
And when all my friends
were out having fun,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.792
I stayed in,
and I studied.

48:27.792 --> 48:30.500
That's good.
That's what you have to do.

48:31.417 --> 48:33.166
Eighty-two percent--

48:39.166 --> 48:42.166
Wait a second.
I like you.

48:43.166 --> 48:46.166
-What's your name?
-Shaun.

48:46.166 --> 48:49.875
Shaun. Shaun?
I like you.

48:49.875 --> 48:51.208
I do.
I don't know why,

48:52.834 --> 48:54.375
I just like you!

48:55.625 --> 48:57.166
Thanks.

48:57.166 --> 49:00.500
I feel so... Good!

49:02.041 --> 49:05.458
Is it me, or is it, like,
hotter than hell in here?

49:05.458 --> 49:09.667
-Hey, can you help me?
-Yeah. Yeah! Yes.

49:09.667 --> 49:14.125
Yes, I can.  No.
I'm-- there's no time.
I'm leaving.

49:14.125 --> 49:17.000
Going to Bali.
Going to Bali with my family.

49:18.875 --> 49:21.166
I love them so much.

49:26.542 --> 49:31.083
I need... Water?
Or... I need to lie down.

49:31.083 --> 49:35.041
-Hey, uh,
before you do that--
-Shaun?

49:35.041 --> 49:38.375
You're my same height.
That is neat.

49:38.375 --> 49:41.500
Yeah, it is. Hey, listen.
Let's go to your office?

49:41.500 --> 49:44.000
And you can add my name
to the acceptance list?

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
-Before you leave for Bali.
-Sounds good.
Sounds good. Yeah.

49:49.417 --> 49:52.750
Oh, man!
The lights are--

49:52.750 --> 49:56.417
-Like, vivid!
-Well, it's
a beautiful night.

49:56.417 --> 49:59.375
-You're so beautiful.
Come here. You're welcome.
-Oh! Thank you.

49:59.375 --> 50:02.417
You know, I really
appreciate this.

50:02.417 --> 50:07.250
That's okay, Shaun,
'cause I feel

50:07.250 --> 50:10.458
like I've known you
forever.
[kissing]

50:10.458 --> 50:12.792
-[Ashley] Hey!
-[horn honking]

50:12.792 --> 50:15.417
[tires squealing]

50:15.417 --> 50:19.250
I have a confession.
I never went to college.

50:21.375 --> 50:23.083
It's overrated.

50:23.083 --> 50:26.417
[inhales]
My brother wants to go
here next year.

50:28.375 --> 50:32.083
[exhales]
Well, I hope he's...
on this list.

50:32.083 --> 50:35.417
-What's that?
-It's a list of people
they've accepted.

50:36.375 --> 50:38.583
They rejected him,
the jerks.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.750
Don't do that.

50:46.750 --> 50:50.667
When I was little...
I was a total pyro.

50:50.667 --> 50:52.959
-I was too.
-Ooh!

50:59.667 --> 51:01.125
Put that out, man.

51:02.333 --> 51:04.625
-Put it out.
-Whoa!

51:13.625 --> 51:16.250
-Who are you people?
-I'm Shaun Brumder.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.458
You're going to help me
get into Stanford.

51:18.458 --> 51:19.750
And we're at your office.

51:22.291 --> 51:26.125
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

51:26.125 --> 51:28.709
[fire alarm ringing]

51:31.000 --> 51:33.375
[sirens approaching]

51:43.041 --> 51:46.375
[ringing, sirens continue]

51:53.875 --> 51:56.875
-[glass shattering]
-Whoo!

51:59.542 --> 52:02.959
-[helicopter blades
whirring]
-[man chattering on radio]

52:05.625 --> 52:08.125
Ray, do me a favor.
Back that engine out.
We gotta knockdown.

52:08.125 --> 52:11.041
-Okay!
-That's negatory, Julio.
Need you to wedge that popper.

52:11.041 --> 52:13.542
Hey!
Hey!

52:13.542 --> 52:16.333
-What's your name?
What is it?
-Uh, Joe-- John.

52:16.333 --> 52:19.250
-Joe John.
-Your name's "Joe John"?

52:19.250 --> 52:22.041
John... Ston.
Johnston, Joe.

52:22.041 --> 52:25.208
-You want to tell me
what happened here?
-Uh, just a fire.

52:25.208 --> 52:27.333
I don't know.
I came by and was...

52:29.375 --> 52:31.208
Checkin' out the fire.

52:31.208 --> 52:33.000
Well, that lady, Mona,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.375
she said you two
were in the building
when the fire started.

52:35.375 --> 52:37.709
Yeah, she's a liar.
'Cause I don't know her.

52:37.709 --> 52:40.208
So, whatever-whatever
she says is a lie. So--

52:40.208 --> 52:43.333
-You're saying you weren't in
the building with that woman?
-No. Not I.

52:43.333 --> 52:48.041
All right.
She started it, all right?
Because, she was, like,

52:48.041 --> 52:50.750
"I hate my job!
I'm gonna burn
this mother down!"

52:50.750 --> 52:53.875
I said,
"You'd better not!
You'd better not!"

52:55.417 --> 52:57.625
-She said it was
an electrical fire.
-It was.

52:57.625 --> 53:00.083
It was a total electrical fire.
It was, like, uh,

53:00.083 --> 53:02.792
the switches had
sparks comin' out, and
the sockets and, uh--

53:02.792 --> 53:05.250
It was like
the fourth of July, man.

53:05.250 --> 53:09.875
-Why aren't you wearing
your pants, Joe?
-I tripped and, uh--

53:09.875 --> 53:12.750
Then I had to take 'em off
to run faster out of the flames.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.083

53:16.083 --> 53:18.208
I think I inhaled
some smoke.

one second.

53:20.208 --> 53:23.083

53:47.458 --> 53:51.083

and the building blows up.

53:54.959 --> 53:57.625
Well, I was just tryin'
to help you, bro.

53:57.625 --> 53:59.458
By setting
the building on fire?

54:00.458 --> 54:04.959
-I was high.
-You're always high.

54:04.959 --> 54:09.458

I'm so sorry.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.667
I should've seen this coming.

54:27.166 --> 54:29.500
The one day I need my family
to come through for me,

54:29.500 --> 54:31.667
they end up doing
what they always do.

54:33.166 --> 54:36.166
My father goes ballistic;
my mother gets plastered

54:36.166 --> 54:38.500
and my brother
burns down a building.

54:38.500 --> 54:39.875
It's like they've
all come together

54:39.875 --> 54:43.375
in some evil conspiracy
to prevent me
from getting anywhere.

54:43.375 --> 54:47.333
-Is that what you think?
-What else am I supposed
to think?

54:50.458 --> 54:53.875
You know,
I really believed that you
wanted to go to Stanford

54:53.875 --> 54:57.166
because you wanted to study
with Marcus Skinner.

54:57.875 --> 55:00.667
That's not it,
is it?

55:00.667 --> 55:03.709
-What are you talking about?
-You want to run away.

55:05.208 --> 55:08.875
You want to be free
of everybody.

55:08.875 --> 55:11.667
You think by
coming up here, you're gonna
meet people that are...

55:11.667 --> 55:14.750
Smarter and saner...

55:15.542 --> 55:16.709
And better.

55:19.667 --> 55:22.375
You know, if you went
to Stanford, that'd be
the end of us.

55:24.917 --> 55:28.750
It doesn't seem to me
like that thought
ever crossed your mind.

55:28.750 --> 55:33.542
-Oh, Ashley, come on!
-Shaun, I'm sorry you didn't
get into Stanford.

55:33.542 --> 55:35.667
But, if you think going here

55:35.667 --> 55:38.417
is the only way you can be
the person you want to be,

55:41.417 --> 55:43.417

-You need an ending.
-I know. I-I just--

-I don't know how to end it.
-You should figure that out.

01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.125
Maybe I can help you.

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:39.125
Well, uh,
I didn't get into Stanford.

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:42.583
Yeah. So, uh--

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.417
So that means
I can't work with you.

01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:55.792
[sighs]
I want to be a good writer,
Mr. Skinner.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.917
But I'm just afraid

01:04:57.917 --> 01:05:00.667
that if I don't get out
of Orange County,

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:04.625
it's never gonna happen.

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:08.792
You don't have to be
afraid of that, Shaun.
You are  a good writer.

01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:13.125
And every good writer has
a conflicted relationship
with the place he grew up--

01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:17.792
Joyce, Faulkner, Tolstoy.

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:19.667
And that's what I remember
loving about your story.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:23.000
It's very conflicted.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.959
'Cause,
at the beginning, you think
these people are doomed.

01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:29.375
I mean, this family is heading
for disaster, and then,

01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:32.166
as you read on, you see
that that there exists,

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:34.375
beneath the surface,
these very real connections.

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:37.125
These...
Deep relationships.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:42.959
[sighs]
What I took
from your story is this:

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.041
That even in a world where
people can be superficial

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:50.709
and stupid and selfish,
