Oh, come on! I know the difference
between talking and flirting.

brought on by the accident,
the brain trauma, the loss of your wife.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.610
What concerns me, Jake,
are the seizures,

05:10.650 --> 05:13.970
because those seizures are definitely a sign
of something far more serious.

05:14.010 --> 05:17.980

and give yourself a chance,

19:05.720 --> 19:08.210
She hasn't spoken for a year?

19:08.890 --> 19:10.850
How was her speaking before?

19:10.850 --> 19:12.330
Just normal.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.170
Any physiological?

19:14.170 --> 19:16.250
Not a thing.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.380
Thought you might be interested.

19:19.140 --> 19:20.780
Definitely.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.260
Good.

19:26.380 --> 19:29.030

19:51.810 --> 19:54.610

20:12.030 --> 20:14.390
Yeah, a long time ago once.

So you know that you can love?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.560
I'm... There's nothing in here.
There's nothing.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.520
It's like... It's an empty well.
It's...

20:25.520 --> 20:27.970
just dry and barren.

20:28.770 --> 20:32.570
Is that why you sleep with all these men?

20:32.730 --> 20:35.450
- No.
- So what is it you want?

20:35.490 --> 20:37.130
- I don't want anything.
- Well, you must want something,

20:37.130 --> 20:38.900

20:42.940 --> 20:44.340
- Happy?
- No.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.820
Pretty?

20:45.820 --> 20:48.070
- No!
- So what?

20:48.790 --> 20:51.310
It makes me feel...

20:53.070 --> 20:58.160
It makes me feel... something,

20:58.160 --> 21:00.360
because most of the time
I feel nothing.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.760
And these are men that
you don't even like.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.120
Right.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.930
So what would you do if you met a man
that you actually did like?

21:09.930 --> 21:11.490
I don't know.

21:13.130 --> 21:17.260

he laid eyes on me.

21:26.180 --> 21:29.230
Katie, I'm Brian.
Nice to meet you.

21:29.230 --> 21:31.070
You study here? I think I've seen
you around before.

21:31.070 --> 21:31.950
Yeah.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.870
- Awesome. What are you studying?
- Psychology.

21:33.910 --> 21:35.430
No way!
I got a buddy over there..

21:35.430 --> 21:37.960
who's just shooting pools
also studying psychology.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.040
I just took an intro course once.
I love that shit, it's like... pooh.

I may get you a drink.

- Thanks.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.450

what's your story?

since she lost her sister.

I mean, they were very close.

Yeah. Okay. Right. Well, listen,
we're both fairly bright guys.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.230
Let's just be frank.

23:08.390 --> 23:10.350
We proposed something that
you've got us know you had no interest.

23:10.350 --> 23:12.790
I'm not gonna bring that up again.

23:12.790 --> 23:16.030
But the reason
I asked you here today is...

23:16.070 --> 23:17.200
Thank you.

23:18.200 --> 23:23.040
Worthington called me, and they said
you're planning to pull Katie out of the school.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.680
Well, that's a mistake.

23:24.920 --> 23:29.170
I mean, if there's a better girl's school in
the country, that'd be news to me.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.850
I simply can't afford it.

23:30.890 --> 23:34.690
Please, that's our pleasure.
You're never gonna see a bill.

23:34.730 --> 23:38.900
I promise.
It's the least we can do.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.380
You've done enough already.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.180
Well, the public schools are a jungle.
Is that what you want for Katie?

23:45.220 --> 23:46.660
I'll figure something out.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.870
Well, like what?
There's public and there's private.

23:48.910 --> 23:50.910
Those are the options.

23:52.710 --> 23:54.470
You all right?

23:55.070 --> 23:56.960
I mean that...

23:57.000 --> 24:01.360
You know how difficult it is to get a kid
into a good private school in New York?

24:01.360 --> 24:05.720

and they're connected and underhanded.

24:06.770 --> 24:09.250
I'll figure something out.
Let me buy you a drink.

- Jake.

If you want, one day I can take you out
and teach you how to ride.

25:54.990 --> 25:59.360
We could go out to the park
one of these days.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.960
It could be fun.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.250

Is she talking?

26:08.290 --> 26:09.850
It's a process.

26:09.890 --> 26:11.490
So she's not talking.

the case to Dr. Weinberg,

26:14.730 --> 26:16.290
she's a very experienced
psychologist.

26:16.290 --> 26:18.260
I just need more time.

And I need something to put
into her sixty-day report.

to impress the state agency

she can't even speak anymore,

26:33.630 --> 26:38.600
and will live an unbearably bleak life
if we don't connect with her, and soon.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.720
Now we've failed her,
and we have to fix it.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.800
We've not failed her.

bright young woman.

26:47.850 --> 26:51.210
You're gonna be an exceptional
psychologist someday.

to admit defeat, and move on.

26:54.570 --> 26:57.100
Let me take her to the park, okay?

- There's no environment, as therapist.

Ah, thanks for coming.

I'm sorry. I hear about your book.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.990
It must've been rough the way
the criticism pegged down to you.

50:11.030 --> 50:13.350
Yeah, well, you know...

I don't know why God invented cockroaches
or literary critics. I'm sure he had his reasons.

Well, you know, I mean,
they just hated it.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.880

one morning I woke up
and jumped out of the car, to pee,

54:31.970 --> 54:35.130

about 15 feet in front of me

that I was his.

I have to admit I was shocked
when Bob shared your case with me.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:56.580
It's unprecedented for an aunt and uncle
to sue for the custody of their niece

when the biological father
is not only alive and well.

I can't tell you how happy
I am he sent us your case.

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:14.560
Sometimes these cases more about hurt feelings
than a geniune desire to obtain custody.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.040
First step is for you to sit down with William,
try and talk him out of pursuing this.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.680
And if he refuses to drop it?

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.730
We'll file a motion to dismiss,

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.050
argue the case is completely without merit.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:29.210
And if that fails?

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.410
We'll kick their ass in court.

Look, I want you to know it's
not a vendetta against you.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.610
We don't blame you for
what happened to Patricia

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:13.250
and we're not retaliating
because you kept Katie

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:17.220
away from us after we took care
of her for a year in your absence.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.620
Our only concern is Katie's welfare.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.750
And if you asked her, she tells you in a
heartbeat she wants to stay with me?

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:28.110
Well, she's eight.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.790
It's inadmissible in court.

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:33.710
It still matters.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.000
You're a reasonable man, William.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.400
And you're a father.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.570
I know that in your heart you
know what you're doing is wrong.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:52.610
Now I admit, I was angry
when I came to pick up Katie

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.780
and you talked of adopting her
out from under me.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.380
And perhaps, at the party
I overreacted.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.590
Perhaps, you overreacted?

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.630
I'm truly sorry for what
happened at Elizabeth's party.

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.870
You provoked me,

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.960
but that still doesn't
justify my action.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.600
And I would welcome
you and Elizabeth

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.010
being more involved
in Katie's life.

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:26.770
Jake, I...

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:31.010
Hey, I didn't file the lawsuit
as a bargaining chip.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:33.730
You know my lawyer John Wilton.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.780
He's a great attorney.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.780
He's not cheap.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.620
He tells me you
don't have a shot.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:46.630
He tells me they'll never separate a
daughter from her sole biological parent.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.030
You know you're gonna
lose, why do this?

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:53.030
You spent a year in a mental institution
which did nothing

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:55.160
to relieve you of your
psychotic breaks.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.760
3 dozen people witnessed you attack me
in my home at a birthday party

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.090
'cause I didn't like your last book.

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:08.010
You gave testimony to the Connecticut
state police that you were having

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:12.050
a heated argument and speeding
at the time of your wife's death

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:13.980
and while they didn't charge you
with reckless endangerment

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.140
that is how it's gonna appear
to the custody judge.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.460
Your last book tanked,

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.070
critically and commercially,
putting into doubt

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.350
whether or not you can even
provide for Katie.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:30.590
And I've got a feeling
you're running out of money.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:35.120
But I'll know soon enough when I
subpoena you for national records.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.240
I got more money than God.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.930
If we lose, we'll appeal.

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:47.210
If we lose the appeal,
we'll appeal that.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:54.100
How are you positioned to handle
a prolonged legal battle?

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.540
You are a very good
lawyer, William.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.790
I'm trying to be a
very good uncle.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:08.990
No, what you're trying to do?

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:12.070
Is you're trying to separate
a little girl

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:15.520
who's already suffering deeply
from the loss of her mother,

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.960
away from the father she loves

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.680
and who loves her.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.800
That is what you're trying to do.

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:28.690
I would hope there's a special place in hell
for somebody who would do that.

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.370
(CAMERON & KATIE LAUGHING)

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:34.420
That did not actually happen!

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.300
- No, impossible.
- Yes, it did.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.660
- Really?
- Yes.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.420
Wow.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.260
- We need a drink.
- Okay.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.300
- You want another one? Yeah?
- Yes, please.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.420
Okay. I'll be...

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:45.750
(LAUGHS) I'll be back.

01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:50.230
JOHN: Hey.

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:51.190
Hi.

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:52.430
How you doing?

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.040
Okay.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.360
You look beautiful.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920
Thanks.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.400
You don't remember me, do you?

01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.720
Yes, I do.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.000
What's my name?

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.680
- Um...
- It's John.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.450
We met at Walker's Pub,

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:08.290
like a year ago, you remember that?
We had drinks.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:09.170
Right.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.530
Do you still have that place with
that incredible view of the park?

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:13.290
I do.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:14.540
- Really?
- Yes, same place.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.940
let's go there, tonight.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.660
Okay. You see, actually,
I gotta tell you someone is sitting there

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.740
and I need you to...

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.260
You had fun, didn't you?

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.109
Listen, can you go?

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:26.470
I mean, 'cause he's gonna be
right back, and...

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:30.390
All right. You're like one of those girls
who just into the one night thing.

01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:31.229
Right? Is that you?

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.830
Can you go, please?

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.920
Well, I just... I don't give a shit.
I can pay you for it.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.120
- All right. Here, I'll help you.
- You want a hundred?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.120
Come on, thanks.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:37.920
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, man.

You know what, you're a bitch.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.760
Here you go.
Just take that with you.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800
You take that, bitch.

'Cause I did.

Who's this guy?

JOHN: You know I banged you
on your kitchen floor,

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.460
you could at least
remember my goddamn name.

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:05.270
You want a hundred?

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.390
Get out of here!

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.350
Get your hands off me.

- Get out of here!
- Get your...

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.270
Get out!

getting potato chip

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.010
and you wind up with some
cheap piece of ass.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.779
Hey, stop that.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:35.580
No.

isn't Potato Chip, it's you Katie.

Okay? You.

Well...

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.800
There are ways that I came up
to help me cope with

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.850
my situation in life that
I know aren't healthy.

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:10.930
I know they're not good for me.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:16.500
(STAMMERING)
but, it helped me fill this void.

Hey, Kate, come here.

Come here, okay?

Hey, all that is just
behind you now, alright?

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.560
Yeah.

really something.

sick but it's worth it.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.660
So it's my mom's birthday
this week,

01:10:54.700 --> 01:11:00.860
and my dad is throwing her a dinner
Saturday night up in Greenwich.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:04.750
You wanna go?

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:06.750
Really?

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.430
Yeah.

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.390
Only if you want to.

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.470
It'll be fun.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.640
Okay.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.480
Yeah?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.640
Oh, wow, we should've left earlier.

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:25.690
Excuse me.

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.650
Come on, we're gonna
miss the train.

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:33.050
What's wrong?

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.420
Hey, what's wrong?

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.340
What?

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.940
Uh... I'm not ready.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.660
Hey,

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.230
it's just my parents, okay?

01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:45.790
And a few good friends,

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:50.430
most of whom aren't horrible,
just rich and boring, all right?

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:54.560
My parents, they're gonna love you,
I promise, they'll eat you up.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.160
Come on. Come on.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.200
I can't.

What the hell are you doing?

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:31.110
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:33.350
I don't know what happened.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.600
You got a PhD in psychology.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.720
What's that supposed to mean?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.080
It means it's pretty obvious
what happened.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.560
You chickened out.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.490
What? It's because you...

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:47.810
What, you thought that my parents
weren't gonna like you?

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:51.330
Or you thought my parents are
gonna like you too much didn't you?

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.500
What? You'd be even deeper than
you are now, is that it?

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.900
How deeper am I in?

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.900
I don't know.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.700
I don't know, Katie. I don't know
what we're doing here.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.510
I'll tell you something.

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:05.990
I'm tired.

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:07.470
I'm tired of...

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.590
What?

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:12.950
I'm just... I'm tired of trying to figure out
what this is, what we're doing.

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:14.440
What are we doing?

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.160
Look, if this is just hanging out and that's all it is,
then that's fine, because you know what,

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.040
it makes me happy.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.880

Stop.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:54.960
Stop!

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.120
Talk to me.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.000
This is not hanging out.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.160
Good! Good!

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.450
'Cause everything I just said
back there was a lie.

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:05.330
Good.

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:07.770
I don't know how to do this.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.330
Do what?

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.650
Be the girlfriend.

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.020
It's all right.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.990
It's all right.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.800
Yes?

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.120
Jake, John Wilton.
How are you?

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.360
You tell me.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.840
The motion to dismiss was denied.
I'm sorry.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.250
Now this doesn't mean that
the judge is taking their side

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.250
or even that he feels they have
a particularly strong case.

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:50.730
It just means he believes there's
enough there to bring into trial.

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:54.420

01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:49.270
finishing one last book.

01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:51.950
That book was about me.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.200
But really it was about life,

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.080
and how he never gave up on me.

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:06.530
It was his way of...

01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:09.370
telling me how much he loved me.

01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:12.730
And goodbye.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.980
That's what this book
is really about. It's...

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.060
never ever give up.

01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:30.390
Life's gonna be really
challenging and unfair,

01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:34.040
and sometimes painful.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.840
I mean, you've been through
a lot already,

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.890
but we can never give up
or stop moving forward or looking ahead,

01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:49.530
no matter how hard the experiences
that we've been through are.

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.100
All I can do is tell you that.

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.500
I love you.

01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.430
And goodbye.

01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:07.670
I love you too.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.400
(VOICE BREAKING)
You be good, okay?

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.320
You have great things
in front of you.

01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:24.330
I will.

01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:26.850
I promise.

01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:46.390
Congratulations, Jake.

01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:47.350
What for?

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:49.470
You're gonna be an uncle again.

01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:54.200
It seems your brother-in-law William
has been having an affair with his secretary.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.360
Who's only 24.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.000
And she's pregnant.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.960
And she's keeping it.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.240
Elizabeth's filing for divorce.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.760
They dropped the suit.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.690
- BOTH: Oops!

01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:13.540
Fathers and Daughters.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:23.030
How do you write a novel in three months?
Usually takes you years.

01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:26.510
Is it any good?

01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.110
No idea.

01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:35.760
That's what you said to me when you
brought me Living the Dance.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.600
I brought you what?

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.730
When you brought me Living the Dance,
the book you won the Pulitzer prize for.

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.100
Oh, God!

01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:49.150

(CROWS CAWING)

01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:11.430
Do you wanna say something
to your father?

01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:28.490
You're my Potato Chip.

01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:33.140
You and no one else.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.560
Hi, sweetheart.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.360
(RINGING)

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.180
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:36.900
I miss you.

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:40.580
And I love you.

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:45.670
God I love you so much.

01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:49.630
I should've said it
a million times.

01:45:49.630 --> 01:45:51.510
Yeah, I really should've.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.720
I was so afraid of you leaving me.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.480
And I know we both know
that I'm not easy.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.130
I know I'm not.

01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:06.410
And...

01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:11.650
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me.

01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:14.620
And you know what, I can't...

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.220
I don't wanna live without you.

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.220
WOMAN:
Cameron, I can go.

01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:25.230
It's my friend.

01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:34.520
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.000
Really.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.520
Katie.

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040
Katie.

01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:10.190
It is a great honor to accept this Pulitzer
on behalf of my client, the late Jake Davis.

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:14.560
That Fathers and Daughters
has won every major literary award

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.560
and been perched to top
the best sellers' list for a year

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.480
is every agent's dream.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.090
That I never got to buy Jake a drink
and slap him on the back

01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:28.730
is my own personal nightmare.

01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:34.180
Katie, I think you're the only person in the world
who will miss him more than I will.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:38.020
- Thank you. Thank you.

ELIZABETH:
I've had a hard life.

01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:12.330
I suppose I was hard right back.

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.420
I'm a grown woman
who's never known love.

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.420
Isn't that something?

01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:30.230
My parents were just the same,

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:33.400
my mother was a terribly mean woman.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.680
And my father, someone we saw
at the occasional Sunday dinner.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.650
You know Katie.

01:48:44.690 --> 01:48:46.970
Men...

01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:49.810
...they can survive without love.

01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:53.940
but not us women.

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.100
