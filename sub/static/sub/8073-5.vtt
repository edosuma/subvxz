[theme music]

00:08.176 --> 00:08.976
Rosie?

00:13.947 --> 00:15.449
What are you doing this time?

00:15.483 --> 00:19.853
I'm directing your
sperms where to go.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.590
Please, I think my
boys know their way

00:22.623 --> 00:24.658
around a fallopian tube.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.559
I don't know, Dan.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.527
I think they're getting old.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.097
I hear 'em wheezing
around in there.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.300
[sighs] I hate
these damn boxers.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.301
Well, tough.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.403
The doctor on "Oprah"
said that makes

00:35.436 --> 00:37.771
your equipment work better.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.807
I'm a brief man, Rosie.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.641
Tell me about it.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.679
You've been making me wear
these things for three months

00:45.713 --> 00:47.748
now.
They just didn't feel natural.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.251
Well, then don't wear
any underwear at all.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.321
Oh, that's just wrong!

00:53.354 --> 00:55.055
Well, I don't know
why you bothered

00:55.089 --> 00:56.657
to even put them back on, Dan.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.058
We're going again in 20 minutes.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.097
Well, you better have
something special planned,

01:03.131 --> 01:05.933
because I don't know if I can.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.535
Well, you think
it's so tough for you.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.471
Gee, I feel like stapling a
picture of Montel Williams

01:10.504 --> 01:11.305
to your forehead.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.778
Where are you going?

01:17.811 --> 01:21.849
Well, Mrs. Withers down the
block wants a baby too, so--

01:21.882 --> 01:24.017
all right, I'll stay.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.720
Ohh, poor Dan.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.390
He has to sit here on the
bed with me for two minutes

01:29.423 --> 01:34.528
and do nothing while me
and God create a life.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.896
Maybe my sperms
are just waiting

01:35.929 --> 01:36.964
for your egg to shut up.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.902
Oh, Dan, I know
that we're both just

01:41.935 --> 01:44.138
sick to death of all
this lovemaking crap,

01:44.172 --> 01:46.440
but we've got to do it.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.242
You know I've been thinking,
when this kid graduates

01:48.276 --> 01:50.244
high school, I'll be 60.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.545
Well, it's one
of our kids, Dan,

01:51.579 --> 01:53.547
so you'll probably be
more like 65 or 70.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.353
Be too old even to
play ball with him.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.855
And odds are, half my
life's over already.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.957
If this kid has to grow
up without a father,

02:03.991 --> 02:06.294
is that fair to him?

02:06.327 --> 02:07.495
I'm scared, Roseanne.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.630
This whole thing's making
me think about Death.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.365
Well, think about
whatever you have to, Dan.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.700
We're going again in 20 minutes.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.174
[theme music]

03:11.259 --> 03:12.125
Hey, David.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.227
Morning.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.828
Mr. Conner, why-- why
are all these dates

03:14.862 --> 03:17.898
circled on this calendar?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.667
Well, you see,
David, that's Mrs.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.271
Conner's ovulation schedule.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.137
No, really, what is it?

03:26.574 --> 03:27.608
No, David, it's true.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.842
You see, two weeks
ago was the last time

03:28.876 --> 03:31.745
Mrs. Conner was fertile.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.048
So these are the
days that you guys--

03:35.082 --> 03:38.352
Ovulate.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.554
Oh my god!

03:40.588 --> 03:41.489
JACKIE: Hi!

03:41.522 --> 03:42.923
Hey.

03:42.956 --> 03:43.891
Roseanne, I'm here.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.792
I got to test.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.828
This one feels lucky.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.997
- Can I get some coffee?
- No, come on.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.965
Let's go set up the test, and
then you can have your coffee

03:51.999 --> 03:52.900
while you wait for it.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.035
- I don't want any coffee.
- Oh.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.370
Mood swings.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.204
That's a good sign.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.910
I started.

04:02.943 --> 04:03.811
What?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.813
I got my period.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.215
Damn

04:08.248 --> 04:09.417
Yeah, well, you better go.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.785
You don't want to
be late for work.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.620
Ohh.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.727
Better start loading
up on my protein again.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.994
Call me if you need anything.

04:21.028 --> 04:21.829
OK.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.935
Well, the good news is I'll be
able to start drinking again.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.236
[whimpers]

04:29.269 --> 04:30.304
Don't be upset, Jackie.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.872
You'll still be
the family drunk.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.443
I'm pregnant.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.481
What?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.483
Fred's the father, and I
haven't even told him yet.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.885
It just happened that one time
that we went out together.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.854
I mean, what are the odds?

04:46.887 --> 04:50.691
Jackie, you're pregnant?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.460
Have you thought about
what you want to--

04:52.493 --> 04:53.361
Well, I'm--

04:53.394 --> 04:54.695
I'm gonna keep it.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.865
I mean, I want to. 'Cause it
could be my last chance to--

04:57.898 --> 05:01.435
[sighs] just say that
you're happy for me

05:01.469 --> 05:02.336
even if you don't mean it.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.037
But please mean it.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.305
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.640
I'm happy from you, Jackie.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.875
Yeah.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.644
I mean, I'd be happier
for you if it was me.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.349
I wanted you to be
pregnant too so then

05:15.383 --> 05:17.985
we could get pregnant together.

05:18.018 --> 05:18.886
Well, it's not too late.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.053
Let's get Fred over here.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.097
I-- I don't know if I
can do this, Roseanne.

05:30.130 --> 05:30.998
You know, I'm not like you.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.501
I'm not the mothering type.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.302
Remember that doll I
had that wet itself?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.237
I just thought it
was too much trouble,

05:37.270 --> 05:38.338
so I stopped giving it water.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.776
Well, you were
just a kid then.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.613
That doesn't mean that
you will be a bad mother.

05:45.646 --> 05:49.282
I mean, gee, at least
you bottle fed it.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.552
I used to rip its head off
and fill it under the tap.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.958
Then last night
I had this dream

05:57.991 --> 06:00.428
that the baby was already born,
and I put it down somewhere.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.295
And then I couldn't
remember where I put it.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.502
Oh, every mom has
that dream, Jackie.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.804
You just reach in through
the back of the crib,

06:10.838 --> 06:12.473
you know, into the
dragon's mouth.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.842
And then you get that banana,
bring it out, blow on it.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.178
And it turns back into the baby,
and then you just fly away.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.316
Just I'm really scared.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.752
Well, you don't
need to be, Jackie.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.955
'Cause I'm here for you, and me
and you can do this together.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.423
What if the kid
doesn't love me

06:29.457 --> 06:32.460
or what if I don't love the kid?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.761
That's not gonna happen.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.070
What are you doing?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.071
I'm trying to see my eyebrows.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.548
Just tell me
that you love him.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.383
Please, just tell me
that you love him.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.194
Well, Roseanne, here I am.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.863
What news is so important
I had to hop in the car

07:09.897 --> 07:11.699
and race right over here?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.734
Oh, well, I
forgot to tell you.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.702
Your brakes are shot.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.172
OK, Mom.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.475
I have something very
important to tell you.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.311
It's a big one.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.713
I need you to sit
in this chair here.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.614
Come over here.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.815
Just stay very calm.

07:27.848 --> 07:28.716
OK.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.417
Whatever you do,
don't get upset.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.588
And Mom, keep an open mind.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.990
Jackie's pregnant.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.259
- Oh my god!
- Mom.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.896
Well, I always knew something
like this would happen.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.165
She got married and
didn't invite me.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.900
No, Mom, she did
not get married.

07:46.934 --> 07:47.968
She just got pregnant.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.404
And you're right, she
didn't invite you.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.906
Oh my, oh no!

07:52.940 --> 07:55.576
She'll never get
her reputation back!

07:55.609 --> 07:58.011
Listen to me, Mom,
this is her reputation.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.412
This is awful!

07:59.446 --> 08:01.782
You know that Sawyer girl who
had a baby without a husband,

08:01.815 --> 08:02.983
she went insane!

08:03.016 --> 08:04.184
Oh my god!

08:04.217 --> 08:06.486
I just keep thinking, what
would your father say?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.454
Mom.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.822
- What would my father say?
- Shh!

08:08.856 --> 08:09.723
Your aunt--

08:09.757 --> 08:10.558
Mom!

08:15.763 --> 08:18.031
Get some control here.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.834
Now, Jackie is going to need
us, and we are going to have

08:20.868 --> 08:22.870
to be very supportive, OK?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.205
I want you to repeat
after me, Mom.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.574
I will be supportive.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.347
I will be supportive.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.125
Well, I suppose it's nice I'm
gonna have another grandchild.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.796
There you go, Mom.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.197
Mom.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.699
Um, Jackie--

08:51.732 --> 08:55.002
I've got something
to tell you.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.937
Uh, Jackie.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.238
Mom and me were just talking--

08:58.271 --> 08:59.539
Well, just, just
a second, Roseanne.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.909
There's something I
want to tell my mother.

09:01.942 --> 09:05.545
Mom, I'm pregnant.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.247
I went out with a
guy I hardly know.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.082
We had sex for hours,
and I got pregnant.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.889
And I'm not gonna marry him.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.026
[laughs] I'm keeping the baby.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.861
And if it's a girl,
I'm naming it Gidget.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.134
What if it's a boy?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.235
What?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.103
What are you gonna
name it if it's a boy?

09:30.137 --> 09:33.641
What about that rock singer
you like so much, uh, Bongo?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.642
What?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.143
What's she talking about?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.144
I think she she makes Ringo.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.846
Yes, Ringo.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.714
That's pretty jazzy.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.349
No, no, no.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.250
No.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.752
What-- what's happening here?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.754
You heard your
unmarried daughter

09:46.787 --> 09:48.689
told you that she's pregnant.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.324
I heard her, dear.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.062
And I want you to know,
I'll be there for you.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.798
I have never been one to judge.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
And thank God for that!

10:03.904 --> 10:06.039
You told her, didn't you?

10:06.073 --> 10:06.974
Well, I--

10:07.007 --> 10:09.076
I just wanted to
soften the blow.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.612
But I didn't want
this blow to be a soft!

10:12.646 --> 10:14.047
This was the one, the one.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.816
This is the moment I've been
waiting for all my life.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.284
This one could've killed her!

10:20.553 --> 10:23.791
Jackie, if you believe
in reincarnation at all,

10:23.824 --> 10:26.226
perhaps this is not the
perfect time to kill Mom,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.929
if you know what I mean.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.965
Well, when you did tell her,
did she at least like faint

10:31.999 --> 10:32.933
or turn blue or something--

10:32.966 --> 10:33.834
No!

10:33.867 --> 10:35.635
Well, you didn't do it right!

10:35.669 --> 10:38.906
You-- you have to let
me tell people, OK?

10:38.939 --> 10:39.807
OK.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.208
I promise.

10:41.241 --> 10:45.112
I'm not gonna tell anybody else
anyways, I mean, besides Dan.

10:45.145 --> 10:49.116
Oh, um, Jackie, can I-- can
I, uh, please tell Nancy too?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.819
No.

10:51.852 --> 10:55.455
I already did, and
I told Darlene too.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.423
Hey, ladies.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.324
I swear to god.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.225
Roseanne.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.592
I swear to god.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.262
Hey, Roseanne, I'm sorry I
wasn't around when you called.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.938
See, he doesn't know and that
counts that I didn't tell him.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.341
What was so important?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.477
Ah, oh, I couldn't
get the lid-- lid off

11:17.510 --> 11:19.612
these pickles there-- there.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.447
Heh.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.353
Man, you're strong.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.590
Anything else?

11:30.623 --> 11:33.193
No, that's about it

11:33.226 --> 11:34.795
How about you, Jackie?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.964
Need anything off a high shelf?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.866
Uh, Fred, I am
not ready to talk

11:38.899 --> 11:41.401
about stuff on the
high shelf, stuff that

11:41.434 --> 11:42.736
is there is not going anywhere.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.471
When I am ready to discuss
it, I will be the one to call

11:44.504 --> 11:45.472
you down here, not Roseanne!

11:51.544 --> 11:53.781
You just had to keep
pushing, didn't you, Fred?

12:07.394 --> 12:11.164
You know, I was just
examining our calendar of love.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.301
It seems I have to
service you tonight.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.903
First, the seduction.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.176
Eh, well, not now, Dan.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.112
I got too many
troubles with Jackie.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.848
She doesn't have a single clue
about this whole pregnancy

12:27.881 --> 12:29.016
thing, you know.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.819
She's talking about
having natural childbirth.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.719
With no drugs.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.753
[winces]

12:35.122 --> 12:40.193
You should show her the
scar I gave you when I had DJ.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.196
Four stitches, saw the bone.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.764
Well, next time I'll
take the hand wound,

12:44.798 --> 12:47.367
and you can have the episiotomy.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.735
Well, that killed the mood.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.975
You know, if Jackie would
only tell Fred about this,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.811
then he could be here helping
her with this instead of you.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.012
He really should know.

12:59.046 --> 13:02.415
Please, Dan, it's bad
enough that Jackie knows.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.517
DAN: Well, this
is their problem.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.954
We're gonna have our own kid.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.924
Dan, I can hardly have a baby
when Jackie's gonna have one.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.325
What?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.727
Hold on a damn minute here!

13:14.761 --> 13:16.663
You had a fit to have this kid!

13:16.696 --> 13:18.498
You put me on a sex schedule!

13:18.531 --> 13:20.000
You took away my underpants!

13:20.033 --> 13:21.869
You don't take away a
man's underpants, Roseanne,

13:21.902 --> 13:25.072
and then change your mind!

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
Well, Jackie needs me.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.408
What makes you think that?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.210
Because she told me so.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.279
She is just absolutely
terrified, Dan,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.915
that if I have a baby too, then
I will not be around, you know,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.516
and available to help her.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.585
I mean, she got down on
her knees and begged me.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.686
That's great.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.655
Let's just put our lives
on hold for Jackie.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.524
Well, we can still have sex.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.493
Here.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.794
Just wear that.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.363
You know how I get around.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.464
I'm angry at you.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.799
When I'm angry at you,
I'm not in the mood.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.235
Oh, since when?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.436
Turn off the light
and don't talk.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.838
Don't tell me what to do.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.208
[claps]

14:03.210 --> 14:05.545
[claps]

14:07.080 --> 14:08.916
[claps]

14:09.616 --> 14:10.717
[claps]
- Oh!

14:10.750 --> 14:11.551
You!

14:22.429 --> 14:24.697
What's the matter?
Your stomach bothering you?

14:24.731 --> 14:25.598
No.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.733
No.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.202
I told you, I don't have
morning sickness, OK?

14:29.236 --> 14:31.238
You know, you
should eat a saltine.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.339
No, I don't want a saltine.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.806
It'll make you feel better.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.542
- Roseanne.
- Come on, for me?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.916
Hey, Jackie.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.251
Fred, Dan.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.119
You know, lately I get the
feeling you've been wanting

14:46.153 --> 14:48.655
to talk to me about something.

14:48.688 --> 14:53.526
Um, yeah, Fred I sort of did.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.263
But I don't.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.799
You know, Jackie, Fred's
had the same dog for 10 years.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.307
Boy, I did not know that, Dan.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.076
Thank you for telling me that.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.911
All of his plants
are alive too.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.613
In fact, Fred, I've
always found you a very

15:13.646 --> 15:15.415
loving and nurturing man.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.816
Thank you, Dan.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.352
I find your honesty unsettling.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.154
No, I mean, I
admire you, Fred.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.992
You're that rare combination
of soft and caring,

15:25.025 --> 15:27.327
yet strong and virile.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.129
Why don't you two
run outside and carve

15:29.162 --> 15:30.430
your initials into a tree?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.701
I'm gonna go to
the bathroom now.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.469
And when I come
back, let's all be

15:36.503 --> 15:37.704
talking about something else.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.045
Look, hey, hey,
whether or not I tell

15:45.078 --> 15:47.014
Fred is my own damn business.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.348
Yeah, Dan.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.849
Yeah, Roseanne, it's my baby.

15:49.882 --> 15:50.750
Mine.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.285
I'm the one that had sex.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.653
I'm the one who's getting fat.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.189
I'm the one whose hormones are
gonna go crazy any day now.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.624
And I wish you
would just leave me

15:57.657 --> 16:00.293
alone, let me do it by myself.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.194
What?

16:01.228 --> 16:02.529
It's all your fault, Dan.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.297
Ever since you told her you
don't want to have a kid,

16:04.331 --> 16:05.832
she's been trying to
get her hands on mine.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.472
What?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.441
Roseanne, I thought
you said we couldn't

16:14.474 --> 16:16.076
have a baby because
Jackie begged

16:16.109 --> 16:18.478
you to take care of hers.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.912
What?

16:19.946 --> 16:22.582
Roseanne, what the
hell's going on here?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.484
Well, isn't it obvious?

16:24.517 --> 16:27.720
I mean, the two of you
are in such deep denial.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.522
That is pathetic!

16:29.556 --> 16:31.158
What are we denying, Roseanne?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.693
Well, heh.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.794
OK.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.464
You are both denying
the fact that you really

16:37.497 --> 16:39.099
do not want me to have a kid.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.034
I mean-- I mean, the idea of
it just terrifies you so bad

16:41.068 --> 16:42.469
that you can't even
cope with it, you know?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.204
So in order to deal with it,
you're putting the whole thing

16:44.237 --> 16:45.305
on someone else
so the two of you

16:45.338 --> 16:46.873
can just sit there
and deny, deny, deny!

16:51.178 --> 16:53.480
You've only made that
up in your own head.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.649
See how deep it goes?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.918
You lied to me, Roseanne.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.355
OK, but at least I had
a good reason this time.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.225
Now, you can't handle a
baby by yourself, Jackie.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.826
I mean, you're gonna
be shooting people

17:06.859 --> 17:09.996
from a tower in a clown suit.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.464
If I'm tough enough
to survive you,

17:11.498 --> 17:12.932
I think I'm tough enough
to handle anything

17:12.965 --> 17:14.067
a kid's gonna throw at me.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.669
Yeah, what about steak knives?

17:16.703 --> 17:20.173
That happened to me twice.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.176
Darlene throws like a boy.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.845
You are not that strong,
Jackie, because sometime

17:25.878 --> 17:28.781
your kid's gonna come to you and
want to know who its father is.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.618
And you don't even
have the guts to tell

17:31.651 --> 17:33.320
the father who the father is!

17:40.059 --> 17:41.128
Fred!

17:41.161 --> 17:42.028
I'm pregnant.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.364
You're the father.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.133
If you want to talk about
that, I'll be in the kitchen.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.575
I'll meet you at home.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.543
Oh, Dan!

17:56.576 --> 17:59.879
Wait a minute!

17:59.912 --> 18:01.814
FRED: Wow.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.782
Good thing I was sitting down.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.457
We've gotta talk.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.724
If you don't want
to have a baby,

18:11.758 --> 18:14.527
don't go blaming it on me.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.464
Maybe it's not that I don't
want to have the baby, Dan.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.899
Maybe it's that
can't have a baby.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.573
Is there something
I should know?

18:26.606 --> 18:30.410
Yeah, I'm 41 years old.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.947
[laughs] Is that
what this is all about?

18:34.981 --> 18:36.015
I mean, come on, Roseanne.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.318
We've only been trying
for three months.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.053
I know, but we never
used to have to try at all.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.256
We'd get pregnant just
using the same soap.

18:47.527 --> 18:53.666
I was just thinking, maybe
my body doesn't work anymore.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.034
Did you ever think
maybe it's my body

18:55.067 --> 18:56.469
that doesn't work anymore?

18:56.503 --> 18:59.872
Well, yeah, that's what got me
through the first three months.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.875
Look, honey, if
we can't, we can't.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.512
Then at least I
get my wife back.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.514
Then in six years when
DJ goes and runs off

19:07.547 --> 19:10.149
with some religious cult, we
can ride a couple of Harleys

19:10.183 --> 19:12.719
across the country.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.754
Oh, that's a
bunch of crap, Dan.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.023
You want to have a
baby as bad as I do.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.260
Not if it means
screwing up my marriage.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.595
Well, you've been carrying
this around for three months,

19:22.629 --> 19:24.297
and you never even said
anything to me about it.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.800
We used to talk about
stuff like this.

19:27.834 --> 19:32.004
Well, that's 'cause it--
it just hurts too much, Dan.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.240
I mean, I've-- every Monday, I--

19:33.273 --> 19:34.140
I let us down.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.174
You don't let us down.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.576
Well, that's
what it feels like.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.844
Well, it shouldn't
feel like that.

19:37.877 --> 19:38.945
But that is what
it feels like.

19:38.978 --> 19:39.946
Well, that's it, then.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.248
We're throwing the
damn calendar out.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.583
We're gonna go back to doing
it the way we always did.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.586
And whatever happens, happens.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.821
Come on.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.690
Remember the good old
days when sex was fun?

19:53.826 --> 19:57.029
Well, yeah, but those guys
didn't mean anything to me.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.672
[laughter]

20:05.705 --> 20:09.709
You know, that dashboard
really brings out your eyes.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.912
Why you French lads sure
know what to say to a dame.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.256
Well, we shouldn't
do it anyway, Dan.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.525
You know, yesterday was
my last fertile day.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.660
There'd be no point.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.495
There's a point.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.167
OK, but try to keep your
butt below the window.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.081
Well, do you think maybe
I could go to the Lamaze

20:49.115 --> 20:50.283
classes or something with you?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.751
I mean, I am the father.

20:51.784 --> 20:52.652
Yeah, but I don't--

20:52.685 --> 20:54.020
I hardly know you know, Fred.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.355
I mean, we only went out once.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.889
That's your fault.
I wanted to go

20:56.923 --> 20:59.659
out with you the very next
day after I impregnated you.

20:59.692 --> 21:03.229
Well-- Fred, we're gonna
have a lot of problems here

21:03.262 --> 21:05.465
if you don't respect my space.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.499
I understand.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.534
It's your body.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.601
It's your decision.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.237
There is nothing that
I can do about it.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.505
Thank you, Fred.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.673
Just promise me,
if you ever need

21:13.706 --> 21:16.309
any help, money,
support, just somebody

21:16.343 --> 21:17.944
to talk to, please call me.

21:17.977 --> 21:18.845
OK.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.746
Thank you, Fred.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.482
I-- I-- I appreciate it.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.651
I guess we should
shake hands or something.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.389
[laughs]

21:32.359 --> 21:34.894
Thanks for the child.

21:34.927 --> 21:38.164
[theme music]
