01:17.845 --> 01:19.244
You know,
my editor thinks

01:19.280 --> 01:20.779
that I should write
them all down

01:20.815 --> 01:22.915
and publish them
in a book.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.583
That's a good idea.

yesterday,

01:49.610 --> 01:51.543
and they want me in Boston
for Christmas,

01:51.579 --> 01:53.078
and I want to be with them.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.816
It's Christmas, em,

01:57.852 --> 01:58.817
and being with my family

01:58.853 --> 02:00.219
is an important tradition
for me,

02:00.287 --> 02:01.647
and I would love
to have you there.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.892
You know I'm more transient
than traditional.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.029
Yeah, I know.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.965
I mean, people probably
always tell you

02:13.000 --> 02:14.333
that one day
you'll settle down,

02:14.368 --> 02:15.801
but...

I don't know
that you will...

At least,
not with a regular guy like me.

02:23.844 --> 02:24.776
[Em]: So...

02:24.845 --> 02:28.080
We broke up...

02:30.684 --> 02:32.151
Which doesn't seem
to surprise you.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.820
You can't fake
chemistry,

02:34.889 --> 02:35.932
especially when one half
of the couple

02:35.956 --> 02:37.589
is rarely in town.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.703
That's because someone
whom I'm pointing at right now

02:39.727 --> 02:40.904
keeps sending me out
on assignments.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.561
Would you like me to stop?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.696
No.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.964

how you do it.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.681
I grew up
living out of my suitcase.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.438
I guess I'm used to it.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.108
And as your editor,
I love that about you.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.177
As your friend...

02:58.913 --> 02:59.913
Say it.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.814
I want you to get that almond.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.920
That would require me

03:07.955 --> 03:09.354
to stay
in one place

03:09.390 --> 03:11.990
for an extended
period of time.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.336
One day, you're going
to find someone

03:13.360 --> 03:15.494
who'll make you want
to do exactly that.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.995
I did.

you're welcome to join

Emory there.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.136
Aw, I love them,

03:24.205 --> 03:25.482
but I was thinking
about renting a cabin

03:25.506 --> 03:26.438
up to the mountains

03:26.507 --> 03:27.573
and relaxing

03:27.641 --> 03:30.175

my next assignment.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.878

to be alone?

On Christmas?

03:34.181 --> 03:35.514

Oh, maybe I should
give it a try.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.507
So you stay at
a hotel for Christmas?

04:02.543 --> 04:03.642
Uh-huh.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.278
My Nana comes over,
we open up presents,

04:06.313 --> 04:08.647
and then we go to a hotel
for brunch.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.449
What do you
and your mom do?

04:10.517 --> 04:11.783
We go to pine grove.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.163
It's my favorite
place for Christmas,

04:13.187 --> 04:14.720
like, ever.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.488
- Have you ever gone?
- No.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.123
You've got to.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.158
There's sledding,
ice skating,

04:20.194 --> 04:21.303

down our own tree.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.328

04:22.396 --> 04:23.895
Yeah, it's so much fun!

Do you have
to go back to work?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.705
Nope,
I'm done for the holidays,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.752
and I figured we could do
some Christmas shopping today.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.276
What are you guys doing
for Christmas?

04:37.311 --> 04:40.579
We'll probably just go
to brunch with my mom.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.947
That sounds fun.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.849
Yeah, it's fun.
Right?

04:44.918 --> 04:45.951
Some year,

04:45.986 --> 04:46.718
you guys should try
and get out

04:46.787 --> 04:48.153
to the mountains.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.599
It really brings out
that Christmas spirit.

do you actually need?

Here's the deal.

to give me an article

05:35.569 --> 05:37.636
to publish online
for Christmas day,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.971

on an ice floe

05:44.411 --> 05:45.711
Hey, did I ever tell you

05:45.746 --> 05:48.180
about the German tradition
of the Christmas pickle?

05:48.215 --> 05:51.450
And that's why you're going
to write me a 2,000-word article

05:51.485 --> 05:53.919
on an old-fashioned
American Christmas.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.788
An old-fashioned
American Christmas?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.924
That's both broad and vague.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.326

to sit back and reflect

on all the Christmas
traditions

06:07.301 --> 06:08.934
As an incentive,

06:08.969 --> 06:10.202
and because
I'm also awesome,

06:10.237 --> 06:13.071
I booked you a cabin
in pine grove.

This is bribery.

Yes. Yes, it is.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.352
I know that look.
What's up?

06:27.388 --> 06:29.054
I was just thinking

06:29.089 --> 06:30.133
that maybe we could do
something different

06:30.157 --> 06:31.089
this Christmas.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.023
Like, different how?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.632
We had an assignment
in class today.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.200
We could write about anything.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.201
I started thinking
about Christmas.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.603
Oh, yeah?

06:44.671 --> 06:45.637
No, I mean, like...

06:45.672 --> 06:47.739
The ones we used
to have with mom.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.640
We'd go up into
the mountains

06:48.675 --> 06:50.642
and have snow,

06:50.677 --> 06:52.055
and everything smelled
like Christmas trees.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.745
You remember that?

06:53.781 --> 06:54.781
It's fuzzy, but yeah.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.353

Build a snowman."

07:03.290 --> 07:05.190

you have some place in mind?

Pine grove?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.115
Apparently,
her best friend from school

07:19.139 --> 07:20.450
has been talking about it
non-stop.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.973
She even made
this "bucket list"

07:22.009 --> 07:23.809
of things to do
to make it the best Christmas,

07:23.844 --> 07:25.004
and most of them
involve snow.

07:26.880 --> 07:31.149
[Mother]:
Oh, Scott, this is so adorable.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.796
I don't think we actually spent
a Christmas

07:32.820 --> 07:34.786
in a cabin in the woods.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.822
Or we just stay here,
you know?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.890
I mean, the important thing
is that we're together.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.403
Yeah, but that's not
what Katy asked for,

07:40.427 --> 07:41.726
and she asks
for so little.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.863
Tell you what.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.142
Why don't I get this
as a Christmas present

for you and Katy?

Mom...

07:48.202 --> 07:49.601
No, I insist.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.970
I'm going to find the most
charming cabin in pine grove

07:52.005 --> 07:52.938
for both of you
to stay in.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.005
What about you?

Bree tenner's birthday

07:55.375 --> 07:56.375
in a few days,

07:56.410 --> 07:57.676
and I promised I'd attend.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.945
Okay, fine, so you attend,
and then you join us.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.879
I mean, you never go anywhere.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.914
Oh, that is not true.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.616
I went to your aunt
Ruthie's July 4th.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.329
That was three years ago,
and that was in Oakland.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.964

Oakland from here.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.287
You barely leave
the bay area.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.289
That's because I'm a homebody,
and you know it.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.836
I'm not letting you be alone for
Christmas.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.026
If you don't go,
we don't go.

You're not.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.240
So, what are you doing
for Christmas, huh?

09:02.309 --> 09:04.876
Are you going to be jetting off
to some far corner of the globe?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.946
Actually, I've rented
a cabin up in pine grove.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.383
Pine grove?

09:11.418 --> 09:12.662
Haven't been there
since you were little.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.419
I've been to pine grove?

09:14.454 --> 09:15.687
<i>You have.</i>

09:15.722 --> 09:17.856
We went there together
for Christmas one year.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.724
You were maybe four or five,
I think?

09:19.793 --> 09:20.926

09:20.961 --> 09:22.338

I started the company.</i>

09:22.362 --> 09:23.495
I don't remember that.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.630
I do.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.243
Might've been the last
old-fashioned Christmas

09:27.267 --> 09:28.633
we had together.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.403
We had
an old-fashioned Christmas?

09:31.438 --> 09:32.837
We did.

09:32.873 --> 09:33.972
Once upon a time.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.139
It's like I stepped
into another world

09:56.163 --> 09:57.629
made entirely of Christmas.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.931
Did I mention the guy
that I rented the cabin from

09:59.967 --> 10:01.199

10:01.234 --> 10:02.734
Uh, you didn't,

10:02.803 --> 10:04.836

it makes perfect sense.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.809
Uh... nope.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.811
Well, don't over-think it.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.713

10:14.748 --> 10:16.281
Well, that's just it.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.384
I haven't experienced it...

10:19.419 --> 10:21.987

that people think of here.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.090

10:31.498 --> 10:32.430

we discussed.</i>

10:36.470 --> 10:38.670
Maybe.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
Ha ha...
Oh!

27:30.449 --> 27:31.582
There we have it!

27:31.651 --> 27:32.549
Nice work.

27:32.585 --> 27:33.884
Thank you.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.119
[Scott]: You did it.
All right.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.689
[Emory]:
That is a beautiful tree.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.057
All right,
one more picture?

27:40.092 --> 27:42.526
[Katy]:
Stand next to the tree.

27:42.561 --> 27:43.927
Right.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.865
You too, dad.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.470
[Laughing] Okay.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.672
Say cheese!

27:54.740 --> 27:55.806
Cheese...

27:55.841 --> 27:56.841
Or Christmas tree!

27:56.876 --> 27:58.575
[Camera clicking]

27:58.611 --> 28:00.355
It's fun having a real one
to play around with.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.879
Oh, yeah?

28:01.914 --> 28:02.980
You can keep it.

28:03.015 --> 28:03.881
[Scott]:
Oh, no, hey, that's...

28:03.916 --> 28:05.282
No, come on.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.684
'Tis the season,
and all that.

28:06.719 --> 28:07.959
I took
a lot of my travel photos

28:07.987 --> 28:09.186
with that camera.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.255
It's good luck.

28:11.791 --> 28:12.956
Thank you so much!

28:12.992 --> 28:13.757
All right, I think I'm
going to need some help

28:13.793 --> 28:15.125
carrying this tree.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.060
I got this.
I got it.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.494
Thank you!

28:17.530 --> 28:18.729
Follow me.

28:18.798 --> 28:19.830
You excited?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.365
Yeah.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.633
Let's take this home.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.271
Katy!

28:27.306 --> 28:29.139
Johnny!

28:29.208 --> 28:31.675
Well, well,
look who we have here.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.911
Why didn't
you tell me

28:33.979 --> 28:34.745
you were coming to
my neck of the woods?

28:34.814 --> 28:36.046
I'm sorry.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.315
I just got
a little distracted.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.150
I see.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.752
Hi. I'm Alice.
Alice Bennett.

28:41.787 --> 28:42.920
My son, Johnny,

28:42.955 --> 28:44.366
goes to school with
Scott's daughter.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.723
Oh, great!

28:45.758 --> 28:47.224
Hi. I'm Emory Blake.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.027
So, are you guys here together?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.328
[Together]: No.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.841
No, we had a mix-up
with our cabin rental.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.198
[Emory]:
Double-booked,

28:54.266 --> 28:55.410
and then my car had troubles,

28:55.434 --> 28:56.578
and I got stuck
by the snowstorm.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.268
Oh...

28:58.304 --> 28:59.536
That's unfortunate.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.872
But I'm heading back
to San Francisco

29:01.907 --> 29:03.107
as soon as possible.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.342
Oh, what a shame
you won't be here for Christmas.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.811
Pine grove is just
magical this time of year.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.313
I'm so glad
that you and Katy

29:09.348 --> 29:10.992
- are finally getting to see it.
- It was about time.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.461
I've been hearing you talk
about it long enough.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.085
Yeah, I practically deserve
a commission.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.753
I don't think
Hal would like that.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.388
Oh, so you met Hal!
Isn't his shop great?

29:17.423 --> 29:18.555
Johnny makes sure

29:18.591 --> 29:19.935
it's our first stop
every time we come.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.725
I'm sure
it'll be Katy's, too.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.094
Although his record-keeping
could use a little work.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.032
All right, well...

29:29.068 --> 29:30.268
We should get this thing home.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.069
Okay, well,
now that we know you're here,

29:32.104 --> 29:33.403
I'll be in touch.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.506
There are so many fun events
you shouldn't miss.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.373
It was really nice to meet you,
Emory.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.041
You, too.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.110
[Scott]:
Great.

29:40.579 --> 29:41.579
Hey, my man.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.088
All right,
let's go, kiddo.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.034
[Katy]: I'll go get
more Christmas lights.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.858
Perfect.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.126
That is a
good-looking tree,

29:56.162 --> 29:56.994
if I do say so myself.

29:57.062 --> 29:57.995
And you did.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.197
And I did.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.410
You know, I think Alice thought
it was good-looking, too...

30:02.434 --> 30:05.068
Amongst
other things.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.271
I'm just saying,
she's very pretty,

30:07.306 --> 30:09.706
and... very interested in you.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.809
She is a parent
at Katy's school.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.255
See how much you guys
have in common?

30:13.279 --> 30:14.411
It's not like that.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.946
Okay.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.018
The thing is,

30:21.053 --> 30:22.686
I haven't really dated
in a long time.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.258
My wife passed away
when Katy was six.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.593
Oh.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.496
I'm so sorry.
I just assumed...

30:32.531 --> 30:35.032
But Katy told me
that Christmas in the mountains

30:35.067 --> 30:37.167
was the one thing
that she could remember

30:37.203 --> 30:38.203
about her mom.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.738
Now I see.

30:41.774 --> 30:43.540
And so she came up
with this list...

30:45.878 --> 30:47.678
And that's why you're here.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.246
That's why we're here.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.051
Nana's going
to love this tree.

30:55.788 --> 30:58.088
All right, what do we
have on that list?

30:58.123 --> 30:59.523
Building a gingerbread house.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.124
Oh!

31:01.160 --> 31:01.925
I saw that there's
a gingerbread house contest

31:01.961 --> 31:02.961
in town.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.762
Dad, we have to do it.

31:05.798 --> 31:07.564
Oh, we have to?
It's a requirement?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.700
Yes.
It's number four.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.437
It's number four.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.370
Well, then you've got to.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.771
All right,

31:14.807 --> 31:15.817
what else do we have
to look forward to?

31:15.841 --> 31:16.841
Baking cookies...

31:16.876 --> 31:17.975
Naturally.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.309
Hanging lights
around the cabin.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.344
Happening.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.945
Also...
Ice skating.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.580
Oh, good.
I saw a rink on the way in.

31:23.649 --> 31:24.715
Do you ice skate?

31:25.985 --> 31:26.985
Um...

31:29.455 --> 31:31.121
I've watched
a lot of ice skating

31:31.156 --> 31:32.589
when I lived in Finland.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.524
It's not really
the same thing.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.193
You think?

31:46.639 --> 31:47.871
Katy!

31:50.709 --> 31:51.842
Okay...

31:51.877 --> 31:52.997
All right, have fun.
Be safe.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.380
You too.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.149
Okay. Here
goes nothing.

32:10.396 --> 32:11.461
You okay?

32:11.497 --> 32:13.664
Uh... just a bruised ego.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.299
[Laughing]

32:15.334 --> 32:16.934
You're not supposed
to laugh.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.936
You get points
for determination.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.348
Yes, well, that is
one of my skills...

32:20.372 --> 32:21.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:21.507 --> 32:23.206
Unlike ice skating.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.742
I will be doing
a triple Axel in no time.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.477
Yes, because you have
an amazing coach.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.513
Because I am
a warrior

32:29.581 --> 32:32.049
when it comes
to a challenge.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.385
[Alice]: Scott!

32:35.421 --> 32:36.453
Hey, Alice.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.721
Hey!

32:37.756 --> 32:39.222
Hi!

32:39.258 --> 32:41.792
We are seeing you
everywhere.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.193
Hi, Emily!

32:43.262 --> 32:44.628
Uh, Emory.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.296
Oh! Sorry.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.831
Good news!

32:47.900 --> 32:49.533
One of the roads
has opened up,

32:49.568 --> 32:50.467
so you should be able
to head home

32:50.536 --> 32:51.401
as soon as your car's fixed.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.736
Oh, fantastic.

32:52.771 --> 32:53.937
Also fantastic...

32:54.006 --> 32:55.539
I scored
two extra tickets

32:55.574 --> 32:56.952
to the local production
of "the nutcracker."

32:56.976 --> 32:59.343
I would've gotten a fifth,

32:59.378 --> 33:01.323
but I assumed that you would be
going home by then.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.213
Oh, of course.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.882
So it's, um, tomorrow night.

33:05.918 --> 33:06.950
What do you say?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.518
You and me,
Katy and Johnny?

33:12.057 --> 33:13.223
Sounds amazing.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.791
Great, then it's a date!

33:16.095 --> 33:17.427
See you then!

33:21.567 --> 33:23.700
"Date" is just
a figure of speech.

33:23.736 --> 33:26.803
One often associated
with going on a date.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.605
Yeah, but it's...
I mean, it's not a date.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.141
Right.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.877
Little pro tip
from a woman's P.O.V.?

33:33.912 --> 33:36.947
She thinks it's a date.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.020
All right,
triple Axel time.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.287
Whoa...

33:44.323 --> 33:45.589
Whoa!

33:51.397 --> 33:52.996
[Editor]:
<i>So, what are you doing now?</i>

33:53.032 --> 33:54.476
<i>Following them around
and taking notes?</i>

33:54.500 --> 33:58.035
No, I'm participating in parts
of Katy's Christmas list.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.302
Oh, good.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.338
<i>I told you,</i>

34:00.372 --> 34:02.439
I cut down the tree.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.141
And I'm very proud.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.809
Is it helping?
With the article?

34:05.878 --> 34:07.344
You know, it is, actually.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.879
I had
a mostly productive morning.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.246
That's encouraging.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.849
You know...
And it's been fun.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.650
Really?

34:14.686 --> 34:16.119
<i>Yeah, I mean...</i>

34:16.155 --> 34:17.821
Bruises
from the ice skating aside.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.755
Naturally.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.157
<i>Plus,</i>

34:20.225 --> 34:22.391
it was very entertaining
watching Scott try to pretend

34:22.428 --> 34:24.226
this whole
Alice-nutcracker thing

34:24.263 --> 34:25.362
isn't a date

34:25.397 --> 34:27.164
when it so obviously is.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.299
That doesn't bother you,
does it?

34:29.333 --> 34:30.333
What?

34:30.369 --> 34:31.568
No.

34:31.603 --> 34:32.636
I mean...

34:32.670 --> 34:34.438
Sure, he's a nice guy,

34:34.473 --> 34:37.107
albeit pretty goofy at times,

34:37.141 --> 34:38.485
but, you know, he should date
whoever he wants.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.876
And you're sure that's not you?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.179
I'm sure.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.482
Anyway, I'm leaving just as soon
as his mother gets here.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.350
What's keeping you there now?

34:47.418 --> 34:48.552
Oh, well, I promised Katy

34:48.587 --> 34:49.864
that I'd help her
decorate the tree

34:49.888 --> 34:51.554
once her grandma gets here...

34:51.590 --> 34:54.324
Which is the quintessential
Christmas experience, right?

34:54.359 --> 34:57.060
Especially with a cute kid
and her handsome single father.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.695
I never said he was handsome.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.030
Is he?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.401
Only in the most conventional
sense of the word.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.070
Meaning obvious
to those who have eyes.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.071
Correct.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.172
So, he's handsome.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.208
Correct.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.642
And you like him.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.024
<i>I believe the word
you're searching for</i>

35:16.048 --> 35:18.014
is "correct".

35:18.083 --> 35:19.983
Veronica,
if you could see this woman

35:20.052 --> 35:21.918
he doesn't realize
he's going on a date with...

35:21.954 --> 35:23.553
I mean, she's perfection.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.589
Nice dodge,
and no one's perfect.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.290
<i>Alice is close.</i>

35:27.326 --> 35:29.392
She's pretty and nice

35:29.461 --> 35:31.128
and has her own cute kid...

35:31.163 --> 35:34.464
I mean, she's exactly what
a guy like Scott would want.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.099
But do they have chemistry?

35:36.135 --> 35:37.200
Because, like I said,

35:37.236 --> 35:39.402
you can't fake chemistry.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.139
[Vehicle driving up]

35:49.448 --> 35:50.547
We made it...

35:50.582 --> 35:51.748
We made it.

35:51.783 --> 35:52.883
And it was worth it.

35:52.918 --> 35:53.884
- This place is beautiful.
- Isn't it lovely?

35:53.919 --> 35:56.353
Oh, my goodness.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.854
I've got to go.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.389
Where is everybody?

35:59.458 --> 36:00.657
[Scott]: Hey!

36:02.361 --> 36:03.793
Oh, my goodness.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.295
I've missed you!

36:05.330 --> 36:06.596
You made it!

36:06.632 --> 36:08.131
Good.
Glad to have you.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.234
Emory!

36:11.270 --> 36:12.135
Come meet my mom.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.970
Hi!

36:14.006 --> 36:16.339
Emory Blake?
How nice to meet you.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.607
You too.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.254
I'm so happy
that you finally could make it.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.410
So am I.

36:20.445 --> 36:21.856
It has been
quite the adventure so far.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.180
I bet.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.014
I'm going to go help Hal
with the luggage.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.582
Okay.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.050
Did you see the Christmas tree?

36:27.085 --> 36:28.151
Tree?

36:28.187 --> 36:29.187
[Gasping]

36:31.523 --> 36:33.156
It's beautiful.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.624
Aw... mwah!

36:34.660 --> 36:36.560
Emory cut it down.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.595
Did she now?

36:37.629 --> 36:38.929
[Katy]:
She travels a lot.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.264
She's had Christmases
all around the world,

36:41.333 --> 36:43.066
but she hasn't had
a Christmas in America

36:43.135 --> 36:44.868
for a long time.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.436
Yeah, so long

36:46.471 --> 36:48.716
that I can't even remember
the last time I celebrated here.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.006
Well, then I'm so glad

36:50.075 --> 36:51.085
our family
could share it with you.

36:51.109 --> 36:53.076
I am going to talk Scott

36:53.111 --> 36:55.178
into making a roast
for Christmas dinner.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.580
Ooh, that sounds amazing,

36:56.648 --> 36:59.449
but I'm out of here
just as soon as my car is fixed.

36:59.484 --> 37:00.984
And when the bridge
is repaired.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.285
The bridge?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.453
It is out.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.666
That's why I brought
Marilyn up the back way,

37:04.690 --> 37:05.822
by ATV.

37:05.891 --> 37:06.823
Seriously?

37:06.892 --> 37:07.857
[Hal]:
They should have it fixed

37:07.893 --> 37:09.559
first thing
in the morning.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.660
[Sighing]

37:10.696 --> 37:12.862
That means
you get to stay here longer!

37:18.503 --> 37:19.436
[Scott]:
All right.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.604
Now, by show of hands,

37:20.639 --> 37:22.199
who wants to finish
decorating the tree?

37:27.813 --> 37:29.346
How come
they went out?

37:29.381 --> 37:30.480
Uh, one of them
must be out.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.282
Well, which one?

37:32.317 --> 37:33.661
You have to figure out
which one it is.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.285
Well, that's inefficient.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.988
Well, you wanted
a genuine Christmas experience.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.923
When do we get
to the cookies?

37:39.958 --> 37:41.358
Here's an extra.
Find it.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.393

from home.

These are your

about putting some of these
on the Christmas tree?

39:18.824 --> 39:19.923
Candy canes?

39:19.958 --> 39:22.392
One of my first
Christmas memories

39:22.427 --> 39:23.793
was one of our neighbors
in Berlin,

39:23.829 --> 39:26.896
their tree was just...
Covered in them.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.732
It was so festive.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.734
So you do have
a Christmas tradition

39:30.802 --> 39:32.001
after all.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.871
I guess so.

39:34.906 --> 39:35.839
Hadn't thought of it
like that.

I love that idea.

39:37.976 --> 39:38.942
All right, we've got
to make sure

39:38.977 --> 39:40.054
we get them all
on the tree.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.331
Just from, you know,

wherever we are
in the world,

41:10.902 --> 41:12.013

41:14.206 --> 41:16.639
Christmas was our
favorite time of year.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.608
I would cook for days.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.910
We would roast
chestnuts,

41:20.946 --> 41:23.090
and I would make sure the house
was thoroughly decorated,

41:23.114 --> 41:24.647

so much more... free.

to get back to that,

Graham crackers?

45:54.619 --> 45:55.551
Perfect!
I love it.

45:55.587 --> 45:56.853
Snow everywhere.

45:56.888 --> 45:57.920
Everywhere.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.561
Finishing touch.

46:05.597 --> 46:06.896
Mm-hmm.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.532
That's a good look
for your snowman,

46:09.567 --> 46:11.145
but you need to go get yourself
a new hat,

46:11.169 --> 46:12.346
'cause your snowman
is presently warmer

46:12.370 --> 46:13.569
than you are.

46:13.638 --> 46:14.904
No colds for Christmas.

46:14.973 --> 46:16.339
Picture time!

46:19.010 --> 46:21.444
Say... snowflakes.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.412
Snowflakes!

46:23.448 --> 46:24.680
[Camera clicking]

46:25.950 --> 46:27.083
Can I take
my camera

46:27.152 --> 46:28.684
to Johnny's party?

46:28.720 --> 46:29.786
Of course.

46:29.821 --> 46:31.487
I'll go get my hat.

46:31.523 --> 46:32.955
Party?

46:32.991 --> 46:34.123
Yeah, uh...

46:34.159 --> 46:35.169
Alice apparently
throws a party

46:35.193 --> 46:37.593
for all the families
that are in town.

46:37.629 --> 46:39.529
She made sure
to invite you and my mom.

46:39.564 --> 46:40.696
That's nice of her.

46:40.732 --> 46:43.065
She's a nice person.

46:43.101 --> 46:44.367
I take it
your date went well?

46:45.904 --> 46:47.203
I'm sorry.
I'll stop.

46:47.272 --> 46:48.272
I'll stop.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.139
So, you're currently single.

46:50.175 --> 46:51.240
Is that why you came

46:51.276 --> 46:53.543
to spend time alone
for Christmas?

46:53.578 --> 46:54.644
A bit.

46:54.679 --> 46:55.878
I guess I came out here

46:55.914 --> 46:57.747
just to, you know,
gather my thoughts

46:57.816 --> 47:00.383
and why I...

47:00.451 --> 47:02.652
I don't know,
haven't settled down...

47:02.687 --> 47:04.987
And then my editor
took advantage

47:05.023 --> 47:06.289
of my quiet alone time.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.957
And then we barged in.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.892
Which has proven to be helpful.

47:09.928 --> 47:11.294
Glad to be of service.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.228
Yeah, it's been...

47:12.263 --> 47:13.663
Different...

47:13.698 --> 47:16.065
Actually doing all these things,
you know?

47:16.134 --> 47:17.533
Decorating the tree...

47:17.602 --> 47:19.468
building this girl here.

47:19.504 --> 47:20.937
[Laughing]

47:20.972 --> 47:23.139
I didn't realize
how much I'd been missing.

47:25.844 --> 47:28.044
Now I just need to figure out
the angle of this article.

47:29.147 --> 47:31.113
Yeah, so,
back to this almond thing,

47:31.149 --> 47:32.815
how did that play
into you being single?

47:34.352 --> 47:36.886
To be fair, it wasn't entirely
the almond's fault.

47:36.921 --> 47:38.788
The break-up was inevitable.

47:38.823 --> 47:40.289
Why?

47:40.358 --> 47:42.859
Well, for starters,
we weren't together enough.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.260
Because of your travels?

47:45.630 --> 47:46.841
Yeah, that was definitely
an issue,

47:46.865 --> 47:48.264
but...

47:50.902 --> 47:52.835
Let's just say
something was missing.

48:03.314 --> 48:04.213
Hello.

48:04.249 --> 48:06.282
Hello!

48:06.317 --> 48:07.561
Oh, I'm so glad
you all could make it.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.285
Great dress, Emory.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.087
Thank you.
You too.

48:11.122 --> 48:12.588
Thanks.

48:12.657 --> 48:13.923
Katy, Johnny's upstairs,

48:13.992 --> 48:15.469
making Christmas ornaments
with the other children,

48:15.493 --> 48:16.392
if you'd like to join.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.660
Can I, dad?

48:17.695 --> 48:18.961
Absolutely.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.398
Um, so,

48:22.433 --> 48:24.200
help yourselves
to everything.

48:24.235 --> 48:27.503
I'm just going to steal Scott
for a minute.

48:29.340 --> 48:30.573
I have some
attorney friends

48:30.642 --> 48:32.441
that I would like
for you to meet.

48:32.477 --> 48:34.710
Great.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.646
She is so lovely.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.381

So smooth.

Hey, Marilyn!

48:43.421 --> 48:44.531
Oh, look who's here.
Look, I'll be back.

48:44.555 --> 48:45.655
Yeah.

48:45.690 --> 48:47.156
Come meet
the travel group.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.128
Ah, fancy meeting Hal here.

49:26.197 --> 49:27.263
What a surprise!

49:27.298 --> 49:28.831
[Chuckling]

49:28.866 --> 49:31.500
It was a very interesting
conversation.

49:31.536 --> 49:32.868
Hmm?

49:32.904 --> 49:35.805
They are all members
of the pine grove globetrotters,

49:35.840 --> 49:37.673
and they have invited me
to join them

49:37.742 --> 49:39.575
on their upcoming trip
down the Danube.

49:39.610 --> 49:40.610
That is awesome!

49:42.113 --> 49:43.446
I don't really
travel...

49:43.514 --> 49:44.413
Well, not anymore.

49:44.449 --> 49:46.549
Why not?

49:46.584 --> 49:47.616
Well, when
I was younger,

49:47.652 --> 49:48.517
I had to raise Scott,

49:48.553 --> 49:50.252
and then...

49:50.288 --> 49:52.021
I think I just got
comfortable, you know,

49:52.090 --> 49:53.489
or maybe stuck.

49:53.558 --> 49:55.591
Gosh, I can't imagine
not traveling.

49:55.626 --> 49:56.592
Really?

49:56.627 --> 49:57.693
Yeah.

Well, aren't we a pair.

Do you want one?

50:04.502 --> 50:06.602
Mm-hmm.

50:10.641 --> 50:11.941
You want to hear a crazy idea

50:11.976 --> 50:13.554
about what would make me
very happy right now?

50:13.578 --> 50:15.845
What?

50:15.880 --> 50:18.714
Going home...
Making tea...

50:18.783 --> 50:21.417
Working on our
gingerbread house.

50:21.452 --> 50:22.985
Okay,
so it's not just me,

50:23.021 --> 50:24.220
because I have been thinking

50:24.255 --> 50:26.689
about using a chocolate bar
for a front door

all night!

I just think
you're jealous

that you didn't think
of it first.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.230

53:35.046 --> 53:36.445
Yeah,
but without your suggestion,

53:36.480 --> 53:37.658
we'd still be in San Francisco

53:37.682 --> 53:39.515
instead of snuggling trophies.

Can we come here

You bet.

Can we invite Emory?

Yeah, I doubt that's going
to happen, sweetheart.

Why?

She's been
a part of everything,

and a big part
of why this is so much fun.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.135
It's true.

54:00.204 --> 54:03.239
She is
an unexpected plus,

54:03.274 --> 54:04.673
but you know,
she has her own life,

54:04.709 --> 54:06.075
a very full life,

which I'm sure will take her
someplace else next year.

if we could come back
here again next year.

Oh, well,

like that, too.

it's me.

if we could invite Emory.

it would hurt to ask.

That's exactly what she said.

55:25.623 --> 55:27.256
Exactly...

Except it kind of does.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.027
Why?

to say yes.

55:34.932 --> 55:36.865
How do you know that?

Mom, Emory is a bright
and independent woman

55:40.304 --> 55:41.670
She's not looking
to settle down,

55:41.739 --> 55:42.783
and she's not looking to spend
next Christmas here again

55:42.807 --> 55:44.139
at pine grove.

with us in pine grove.

to share sometime...

it's always embarrassing

by telling him how you feel,
or kissing him.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.264

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.473
Aw...

01:16:19.509 --> 01:16:20.708
[Cell phone ringing]

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:26.747
Hey, Hal.
What's up?

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.549
<i>Emory's car broke down.</i>

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:29.995
<i>Her friend, Veronica,
just called me.</i>

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:32.320
<i>Did she say where Emory was?</i>

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.488
<i>No, her phone cut out.</i>

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:36.958
Okay, I'll check the direction
that I saw her drive out.

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:37.892
Uh, stay in touch.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.260
What?

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.262
Emory's car broke down.

01:16:41.331 --> 01:16:42.708
She's somewhere
on the side of the road, so...

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:43.732
Be careful!

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:56.410
Whoo...

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.655
[Shivering]

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.131
[Chuckling]

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:19.033
Merry Christmas.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:23.838
[Engine humming]

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.108
[Knocking]

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.713
You've really got to think
about getting a new car.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.583
- You think?
- Come on.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.856
How did you know?

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.425
Your friend called Hal,
and Hal called me,

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.926
and I came looking.

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:47.728
Well, thank you.

01:17:47.764 --> 01:17:49.597
We're not in the clear yet.

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:51.532
I mean...
This visibility's dangerous.

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:52.567
I almost turned back.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.070
Why didn't you?

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.006
I care about you.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.912
You know,
until we can see clearly again,

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:05.713
we're going to have
to wait this out here,

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:08.516
so it looks like

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:10.151
you're stuck with me
a little longer.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.552
I'm sorry about all this.

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:13.921
I know it isn't exactly
part of your Christmas plans.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:21.195
I just...

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.730
I just, I don't know
why you left.

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.365
I told you,

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.711
my editor gave me
a new assignment.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:27.301
C'mon, Emory.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:28.903
Something happened.

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:30.204
Just be honest with me.

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:32.840
Tell me, why
did you leave?

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:34.642
I was trying
to make it easier for you.

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:37.778
Easier?

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:43.217
I heard you talking to Marilyn
about me...

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:44.652
How we're not suited
for each other.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.254
So I decided

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:50.124
to get out of dodge,
so to speak.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:52.426
I said that about Alice...

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.697
Whom, let
the record show,

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:59.567
I have
zero romantic interest in.

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:02.803
But she's perfect.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.238
Not for me.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.187
You know, I happened to notice

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:11.579
that your car is facing north,

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.080
instead of south.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:17.685
I was headed back
to the cabin.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.089
I got the email from Katy,
with the photos.

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:23.791
I saw it, too.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.892
I tried
to convince myself

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.061
that what I was feeling
wasn't true.

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:31.132
But then she captured it.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:32.967
Yeah.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.802
She did.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.208
Let me be perfectly clear
with you.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:45.079
You captured all
of my attention

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:48.115
from the moment
you threatened me

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.417
with krav maga.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:53.320
That's what you get
for crashing my vacation.

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:55.189
You crashed mine.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.994
Scott, I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:03.497
It feels right.

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.334
So we're in this together?

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:09.637
All the way.

is happening here,

so how could I miss that?

You couldn't.

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:17.705
Nope.

for the world.

coming on the April cruise!
