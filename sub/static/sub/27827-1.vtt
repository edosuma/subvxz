Well, then, is Zaggy
gonna speak?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.458
Yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna speak.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.250
No, you shouldn't speak
either.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.625
Yeah, what are you gonna--
what are you gonna--

17:43.709 --> 17:45.125
I'm gonna say something
from the heart.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.583
See, there you go.
You say something.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.417
You wanna go see Dada?
Here. I'll be back.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.750
Of all people, you shouldn't
speak from the heart.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.792
He wants to sit with you.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.291
I'm sorry you didn't find
your dad.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.792
Um, it's okay.
I'll find him soon.

17:58.875 --> 17:59.875
I got his address.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.250
Dear God,

18:01.333 --> 18:03.208
take care of Joe...

18:03.291 --> 18:04.250
Cut that shit out.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.041
What?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.750
We don't pray.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.166
We're in a church.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.041
Okay, fine.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.458
Maybe it's okay,
just for today.

18:13.542 --> 18:14.834
Bye.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.333
See you soon.
Mwah.

18:16.417 --> 18:17.959
- Mama.
- Okay.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.166
Ah, thank you so much
for coming.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.709
Of course. You know
I love me some Joe.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.667
- I know.
- He was my favorite one

18:24.750 --> 18:26.291
of your family members,
honestly.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.208
Me too, kind of,

18:28.291 --> 18:29.583
and he wasn't even related.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.333
- That's why.
- Mm.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.875
That's exactly why.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.959
[sighs]
There's, like, nobody here.

18:35.041 --> 18:36.709
I know,
but there's some...

18:36.792 --> 18:38.667
cuties up in here.
How you doing?

18:38.750 --> 18:41.375
- What are you wearing?
- You like it?

18:41.458 --> 18:44.291
My mom let me borrow it.
I didn't have anything black.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.834
I'm not mad at it at all.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.208
- Right?
- Yeah.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.083
My belly's free,
and so are my farts.

18:49.166 --> 18:52.291

18:54.583 --> 18:56.208
[laughs]

18:58.458 --> 19:00.125
What is wrong with you?

19:00.208 --> 19:02.291
I'm high as fuck.
I popped a weed gummy.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.625
- [laughs]
- Oh.

19:04.709 --> 19:05.709
I didn't.

[cell phone chimes]

19:06.709 --> 19:09.667
Oh, shit.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.667
Oh, man, my dad's
such an asshole.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.792
- Why?
- He treats me like a teenager.

19:14.875 --> 19:16.291
"My kitchen
ain't a rec room."

19:16.375 --> 19:18.667
You do live in his house
and get high all day,

19:18.750 --> 19:20.375
and your favorite book
is Harry Potter.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.166
[gasps]
That's who you look like.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.083
- What?
- A Dementor!

19:25.166 --> 19:27.000
Okay, I gotta pee.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.542
[sighing]

19:28.625 --> 19:29.792
You wanna come with me?

19:29.875 --> 19:30.959
I don't.
I wanna sit here.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.291
I wanna be high...

19:33.375 --> 19:34.500
and enjoy this funeral.

19:34.583 --> 19:35.750
Okay?

19:35.834 --> 19:37.500
I'll be back.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.125
[laughs]

19:40.208 --> 19:42.458
Don't she look
like a Dementor?

- Hi.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.166
Are you okay?

19:58.250 --> 19:59.458
Yeah.

19:59.542 --> 20:01.458
I didn't know
you knew Joe.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.834
Um, I-I didn't know Joe,

20:03.917 --> 20:05.166
but, you know,
your mother and I

20:05.250 --> 20:07.041
have gotten
to be very close.

20:07.125 --> 20:07.875
Really?

20:07.959 --> 20:09.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.583
Also, Mr. Daddy
is fucking prostitutes,

20:12.667 --> 20:14.208
so there's that.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.458
They're not
prostitutes, Mom.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.625
Well, either way,
that sounds terrible.

20:20.709 --> 20:23.291
I'm so sorry.
Um, I have to pee,

20:23.375 --> 20:24.166
but I'd love to hear
about it later.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.458
Okay, yeah.
Okay.

[crying] Oh, my heart's
broke in two.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.750
I never should've
left him alone

20:51.834 --> 20:53.792

20:57.417 --> 20:59.333
Everyone deserves
a proper burial.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.125
Thank you for doing this.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.208
Thank you.

21:06.291 --> 21:07.542

a few more minutes

21:07.625 --> 21:08.750

Are you--are you looking
for Jennifer, sweetie?

No, I know.

It feels like yesterday.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.291
It does. It does.

Did you know that she
was conscious

I'm at my stepdad's funeral
down the street,

23:03.667 --> 23:05.417
and all the bathroom doors
were locked,

23:05.500 --> 23:07.542
- and I have to pee so bad.
- Oh, here, honey.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.000
- Come in. Come in.
- Okay, thank you.

We've got one
at the top of the stairs,

23:15.041 --> 23:16.959
and there's another one
at the end of the hall.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.792
You just take
your pick.

Okay, I'm just gonna go
to the one down the hall.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.500
Okay, but-but you have
to go down this hall,

23:33.583 --> 23:35.500
and then you have
to go to the kitchen,

23:35.583 --> 23:37.208
and then you're gonna have
to go

23:37.291 --> 23:38.792
down the other hall,

23:38.875 --> 23:40.208
and then you'll find

24:31.166 --> 24:33.375
and now your stepfather?

- Come with me.

in the past, honey.

Right.

25:06.208 --> 25:07.667
I think it was February.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.834
It was February,
if I remember correctly.

25:10.917 --> 25:12.625
Just hang on a second.
I'm gonna find this for you.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.917
spending afternoons
banging chinks.

Chinks!
I guess you call them

26:24.875 --> 26:28.333
"Asians" now, but back then,
they were chinks.

26:28.417 --> 26:29.667
And I tell you, boy,
