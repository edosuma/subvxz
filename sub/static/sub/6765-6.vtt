00:15.430 --> 00:17.261
Aren't you glad we don't
go to this school?

00:17.298 --> 00:19.732
Can you imagine having this
ugly gold as your school color?

00:19.767 --> 00:21.962
lt's almost grounds
for transferring.

00:25.106 --> 00:26.334
-Mission accomplished.
-Right.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.001
l still don't think
this is gonna work.

00:28.042 --> 00:29.475
Hey, show a little faith,
will you?

00:29.511 --> 00:31.411
Do you think anyone can
tell we don't go here?

00:31.446 --> 00:33.073
Well, your C.U. Alpha pin

00:33.114 --> 00:34.081
might have given it away.

00:34.149 --> 00:35.081
Donna!

00:35.150 --> 00:36.549
What? l forgot l had it on.

00:36.584 --> 00:37.551
Details, Donna.

00:37.585 --> 00:39.849
Details. A good spy
doesn't forget the details.

00:39.888 --> 00:41.981
Hey, l never said
l wanted to be a spy.

00:42.023 --> 00:43.490
Oh, well, it's a little
late for that now.

00:43.525 --> 00:46.756
Can't we just make, like,
a big float and call it a day?

00:46.794 --> 00:47.818
Hey, you volunteered

00:47.862 --> 00:49.762
for the Greek
Homecoming Committee.

00:49.797 --> 00:52.459
Stealing the SCU mascot
comes with the territory.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.297
So, how many times
has it been stolen?

00:54.335 --> 00:55.427
Once.

00:55.470 --> 00:58.098
30 years ago, when my dad

00:58.206 --> 01:00.071
and some of his KEG
brothers pulled this off.

01:00.108 --> 01:03.009
And it is definitely time
for history to repeat itself.

01:03.044 --> 01:05.035
Exactly where are we going?

01:05.078 --> 01:06.512
Right there.

01:21.296 --> 01:23.423
l didn't know it was so tall.

01:23.464 --> 01:24.692
Looks heavy, too.

01:24.732 --> 01:27.929
Well, we're not gonna do
anything right now, right?

01:27.969 --> 01:28.993
Of course not.

01:29.037 --> 01:30.231
This is a fact-finding mission.

01:30.271 --> 01:32.967
Well, the fact is
it's way too big to move.

01:33.007 --> 01:35.032
Not to mention those two guys
standing guard over there.

01:35.076 --> 01:37.306
You think they're always there?

01:37.345 --> 01:40.644
Probably 24 hours a day,
until Saturday's game.

01:40.682 --> 01:42.309
What now, Mr. Bond?

03:53.981 --> 03:55.278
Ferdinand!

03:55.316 --> 03:56.408
How are you?

03:56.451 --> 03:58.078
lt's about time
you paid us a visit.

03:58.119 --> 03:59.381
How are Cora and the boys?

03:59.420 --> 04:01.752
They are mad at me because
l didn't bring them.

04:01.789 --> 04:03.484
Arnold, they are dying
to see you.

04:03.524 --> 04:05.583
Well, they have a standing
invitation, as always.

04:05.626 --> 04:08.561
President Quintero, may l
present Professor Evan Clay

04:08.596 --> 04:10.325
of our lnternational
Studies Department.

04:10.365 --> 04:11.696
l've read your latest book.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.031
And Professor Lin Suhoto, of
our Asian Studies Department.

04:14.068 --> 04:16.332
Professor Suhoto
did her thesis on Selanesia.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.565
On your educational reform.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.438
Fantastic! l'd like to
have a look at it...

04:20.475 --> 04:21.874
Now here is the real reason why

04:21.909 --> 04:23.035
l came all the way
to the States!

04:23.144 --> 04:24.168
Hi, Nando!

04:24.212 --> 04:25.702
Hi, how are you?

04:25.747 --> 04:27.715
President Quintero.

04:27.749 --> 04:28.613
Dad, you're so formal.

04:28.649 --> 04:30.708
Your father's an old
stick-in-the-mud.

04:30.752 --> 04:32.049
So, how is my Clare?

04:32.153 --> 04:34.246
Couldn't be better.

04:34.288 --> 04:35.482
Oh, have you met Brandon yet?

04:35.523 --> 04:36.285
Brandon!

04:36.324 --> 04:37.848
Brandon Walsh,

04:37.892 --> 04:39.484
l'd like you to meet
President Quintero.

04:39.527 --> 04:41.256
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

04:41.295 --> 04:42.319
My pleasure.

04:42.363 --> 04:43.387
Besides being Clare's boyfriend,

04:43.431 --> 04:45.399
Brandon is also
student body president

04:45.433 --> 04:46.730
of California University.

04:46.768 --> 04:48.065
A fellow chief executive.

04:48.136 --> 04:50.229
Well, he doesn't get
perks like you do though.

04:50.271 --> 04:51.260
No private jet?

04:51.305 --> 04:53.500
l'm still working
on a parking space.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.736
Oh, we'll handle that
in due time, Brandon.

04:55.777 --> 04:57.438
Let's all go
in the living room.

04:59.313 --> 05:01.747
What was that comment about
me being your boyfriend?

05:01.783 --> 05:03.341
Don't ask me.

05:03.384 --> 05:06.649
l can't help it if he
lives in a fantasy world.

05:06.687 --> 05:08.951
So, your father and Quintero
are pretty tight, huh?

05:08.990 --> 05:10.548
Yeah, they met at Wharton.

05:10.591 --> 05:12.115
Actually, he introduced
my mom and dad.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.219
No wonder it's such
a happy reunion.

05:14.262 --> 05:16.822
Well, it's not, exactly.

05:18.399 --> 05:19.388
Can you keep a secret?

05:19.434 --> 05:20.458
Sure.

05:22.069 --> 05:25.630
Nando's here for treatment
at CU Medical Center.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.664
He has liver cancer.

05:31.746 --> 05:32.770
l'm sorry.

05:37.285 --> 05:38.912
ls your father still
having the reception here

05:38.953 --> 05:39.977
for him tonight?

05:40.021 --> 05:41.420
Yeah, and you better be here.

05:44.826 --> 05:47.727
Let's face it,
this bear heist is a wash.

05:47.762 --> 05:50.162
There is no way l'm going
back to the Greek Council

05:50.198 --> 05:52.223
and telling them that we
can't pull this off, okay?

05:52.266 --> 05:53.392
Well, if we could
just figure out

05:53.434 --> 05:54.867
how to lose those guards
for a few moments...

05:57.271 --> 05:58.238
Valerie.

05:58.272 --> 06:00.740
Come on over here
and help us brainstorm

06:00.775 --> 06:01.935
for this homecoming stunt.

06:01.976 --> 06:03.375
Sure. What do
you have in mind?

06:03.411 --> 06:04.673
We need to steal something

06:04.712 --> 06:06.680
that's under
24-hour surveillance.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.614
Not to mention ten feet tall
and 200 pounds.

06:08.649 --> 06:11.140
ln other words,
mission: impossible.

06:11.185 --> 06:13.676
Hmm. You know, l knew
a couple girls

06:13.721 --> 06:15.689
at SUNY Buffalo who had
to create a distraction

06:15.723 --> 06:17.350
kind of like this.

06:17.391 --> 06:19.552
ln fact, it was
exactly like this.

06:19.594 --> 06:21.687
Well, if you've got a plan,
we could sure use one.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.220
The only thing is though,
it could be a little cruel.

06:24.265 --> 06:26.290
Cruel is okay.

06:26.334 --> 06:27.665
Cruel is preferable.

06:27.702 --> 06:28.964
Sit down.

06:29.003 --> 06:30.334
Thanks.

06:34.509 --> 06:36.534
Oh, she should be down
for at least an hour.

06:36.577 --> 06:39.045
Oh, good.
We could use the quiet.

06:39.080 --> 06:44.609
How would you like to take
a little cat nap with me?

06:47.421 --> 06:48.388
l'm sorry, sweetie.

06:48.422 --> 06:51.585
l meant quiet so l could study.

06:51.626 --> 06:53.685
Guess you could turn it on
for the women at work,

06:53.728 --> 06:55.059
but not for your
own wife, right?

06:55.096 --> 06:57.394
Oh, God, are we back
to this again?

06:57.431 --> 06:59.058
Yeah, l guess we are.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.864
Look, l've told you
a million times,

07:01.903 --> 07:03.427
a good bartender always flirts

07:03.471 --> 07:04.665
with the women
customers a little.

07:04.705 --> 07:06.195
Right, so you can end up
with more cash

07:06.240 --> 07:08.003
in your pocket when you get
home-- l've heard that before,

07:08.075 --> 07:09.007
Okay?

07:09.076 --> 07:10.134
But that's just the
way it is, okay?

07:10.177 --> 07:12.202
No, it's not okay! lt's seedy.

07:12.246 --> 07:13.270
Oh, come on-- it's not like

07:13.314 --> 07:14.303
anything goes on
with these women.

07:14.348 --> 07:15.508
You know it doesn't
mean anything.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.575
lt does! lt means that we hardly
have any time together,

07:17.618 --> 07:19.745
and then when we do, all
you want to do is study!

07:19.787 --> 07:21.778
Look, l have to study.

07:24.926 --> 07:27.121
Look, we're both really busy
right now, all right?

07:27.161 --> 07:29.061
lt's just bad timing.

07:42.276 --> 07:44.904
Jesse, l'm worried about us.

07:44.946 --> 07:46.038
Well, don't be.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.708
We're okay. We're okay.

07:57.425 --> 07:59.052
Come in.

07:59.093 --> 08:00.390
Brandon Walsh?

08:00.428 --> 08:01.861
Wow.
You guys are my first visitors.

08:01.896 --> 08:03.295
-Welcome.
-Hi, l'm Kaye Whitney.

08:03.331 --> 08:04.958
We met during the campaign.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.330
You're Josh's friend.

08:06.367 --> 08:07.664
You canvassed for us, right?

08:07.702 --> 08:10.637
Congratulations, belatedly.

08:10.671 --> 08:12.002
-And this is Ben Lerner.
-Hey.

08:12.106 --> 08:13.733
We're the cochairs
of the CU chapter

08:13.774 --> 08:15.332
of Human Rights lnternational.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.604
Josh was on our
executive board.

08:16.644 --> 08:18.908
Yeah, l remember.
What can l do for you guys?

08:18.946 --> 08:19.913
Well, uh, it's going around

08:19.947 --> 08:20.914
that the president
of Selanesia

08:20.948 --> 08:22.006
is here on campus.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.244
Ferdinand Quintero.
l met him this morning.

08:24.285 --> 08:26.276
You actually pressed flesh
with the Butcher, huh?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.845
-The Butcher?
-Brandon, did you know

08:28.889 --> 08:31.722
that last year there were
over 450 incidents of torture

08:31.759 --> 08:33.192
-in his country?
-That's right.

08:33.227 --> 08:35.388
Whippings, beatings--
government-sanctioned.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.624
And you're saying
Quintero knows about this?

08:37.664 --> 08:39.360
Quintero orders it.
This guy is a murderer.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.628
He shouldn't be on our campus.

08:40.668 --> 08:41.965
He's an enemy to the people.

08:42.003 --> 08:45.029
Look, guys, he's not here
on a political visit.

08:45.072 --> 08:46.505
He's here as Chancellor
Arnold's personal guest.

08:46.540 --> 08:47.939
Well, we're going
to make his visit

08:47.975 --> 08:49.567
as unpleasant as possible.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.044
Now, are you, as our
student body president,

08:52.079 --> 08:53.137
with us or not?

08:54.482 --> 08:56.040
Listen...

08:56.083 --> 08:58.051
admittedly,
l don't know that much

08:58.085 --> 09:01.714
about the state of affairs
in Selanesia, but...

09:01.756 --> 09:02.814
l just met this guy.

09:02.857 --> 09:03.824
He seems like

09:03.858 --> 09:05.325
a normal person.

09:05.359 --> 09:06.758
Your ignorance
is showing, Walsh.

09:06.794 --> 09:09.854
Brandon, we know what
we're talking about.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.296
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

09:11.332 --> 09:12.993
You're wasting
your breath, Kaye.

09:13.034 --> 09:15.332
You remember what Alex Diaz
said about this guy.

09:15.369 --> 09:17.132
You really are
the chancellor's lackey,

09:17.171 --> 09:18.763
aren't you?

09:27.948 --> 09:29.711
lt was a pleasure, guys.

09:37.058 --> 09:38.025
Guess who?

09:38.059 --> 09:39.686
Ray, hi!

09:39.727 --> 09:41.217
Hi. What're you working on?

09:41.262 --> 09:43.025
lt's a promo for the
Admissions Office.

09:43.064 --> 09:44.361
l'm trying to pick out

09:44.398 --> 09:46.161
the prettiest parts
of campus to use.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.225
Well, why don't you just use
a shot of yourself,

09:48.269 --> 09:50.362
talking about how much
you like it here?

09:50.404 --> 09:54.363
You're one of the prettiest
things l've seen on campus.

09:54.408 --> 09:56.376
You are smooth, aren't you?

09:56.410 --> 09:59.174
Well, despite the rough edges.

09:59.213 --> 10:01.647
Actually, l, uh,
came to say good-bye.

10:01.682 --> 10:04.378
Why? Where are you going?

10:04.418 --> 10:05.908
Well, we're done
with the job here.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.580
You can now consider
your college

10:07.621 --> 10:09.179
completely earthquake-safe,

10:09.223 --> 10:14.388
unless we get a shaker over 9.2.

10:14.428 --> 10:15.952
Uh-oh. Here it comes.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.491
Anyway.

10:20.534 --> 10:21.831
Uh... So long.

10:21.869 --> 10:24.929
Well, l was kinda getting
used to you being around.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.872
Well, why don't you give me
your phone number

10:26.907 --> 10:28.534
and l'll be sure
to be ''around'' again.

10:31.312 --> 10:32.506
Um...

10:35.783 --> 10:36.841
What? ls someone already

10:36.884 --> 10:38.875
carrying your books
home from school?

10:38.919 --> 10:41.752
Sort of.

10:41.789 --> 10:43.347
Well, l can compete
with ''sort of.''

10:45.126 --> 10:46.753
That's not what l meant.

10:46.794 --> 10:48.785
l meant l already
have a boyfriend.

10:48.829 --> 10:51.263
Oh. Well, lucky him.

10:53.134 --> 10:55.500
How serious is this boyfriend?

11:00.808 --> 11:02.275
l don't know yet.

11:02.309 --> 11:04.641
Well, he couldn't have too much
of a lead on me then.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.377
Mm-mm.

11:07.414 --> 11:09.712
Well, then, respectfully,

11:09.750 --> 11:12.913
l'm gonna ask for your
phone number one more time.

11:27.368 --> 11:28.926
Clare, tell me something.

11:28.969 --> 11:31.733
What do you know about torture
going on in Quintero's country?

11:31.772 --> 11:34.434
Torture?
Brandon, that's absurd.

11:34.475 --> 11:36.534
That's not what Human Rights
lnternational says.

11:36.577 --> 11:38.340
Yeah, well, that group's
been all over Nando

11:38.379 --> 11:39.437
right from the beginning.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.845
So you have heard of this?

11:40.881 --> 11:42.508
Yeah, but there's no truth
to it.

11:42.550 --> 11:43.539
How do you know?

11:43.584 --> 11:45.415
Because, Brandon,
l've been there.

11:45.452 --> 11:47.784
My father worked
with Nando on the reforms.

11:47.822 --> 11:49.756
l practically watched them
install democracy

11:49.790 --> 11:50.757
in that country.

11:50.791 --> 11:53.521
Besides, do you really think

11:53.561 --> 11:55.552
my father's gonna be friends
with a butcher?

11:55.596 --> 11:57.564
l wouldn't think so.

11:57.598 --> 12:00.328
Now, the baker and the
candlestick maker, maybe,

12:00.367 --> 12:02.164
but the butcher, no way.

12:08.342 --> 12:11.038
So, do you think it would
blow Jim and Cindy away

12:11.078 --> 12:12.568
if l didn't come home
until morning?

12:12.613 --> 12:14.945
Mm, what do you think?

12:14.982 --> 12:18.713
They're so wholesome
and Midwest it kills me.

12:18.752 --> 12:21.050
What happened to you then?

12:21.088 --> 12:24.421
Actually, l'm working
with the Homecoming Committee

12:24.458 --> 12:26.050
this weekend on a caper.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.652
Very apple pie of me,
don't you think?

12:29.697 --> 12:30.721
l suppose.

12:36.036 --> 12:39.870
Well, l don't want to shatter
the image just yet.

12:42.543 --> 12:44.875
Same time,
same station tomorrow?

12:47.081 --> 12:48.173
l don't know.

12:48.215 --> 12:50.206
Let's not get
in a rut here, okay?

12:50.251 --> 12:52.913
No rut.

12:52.953 --> 12:55.217
Neither of us want anything
heavy here, Dylan.

12:55.256 --> 12:57.224
Yeah, well, just so long
as we remember that.

12:57.258 --> 13:00.352
Got burned out
on the real thing, huh?

13:00.394 --> 13:02.555
l'm just taking a breather.

13:05.799 --> 13:08.131
You were really in love
with Brenda, weren't you?

13:08.168 --> 13:12.537
That was a long time ago.

13:12.573 --> 13:14.165
And Kelly?

13:14.208 --> 13:17.769
What is this, 20 questions?

13:17.811 --> 13:21.042
l just want to know
who you loved more,

13:21.148 --> 13:23.981
the blonde or the brunette?

13:24.018 --> 13:25.485
Why? You thinking
of dyeing your hair?

13:25.519 --> 13:28.044
Maybe.

13:28.122 --> 13:31.683
Look, don't go falling in love
here, okay?

13:31.725 --> 13:36.059
l'm not looking for love.

13:36.096 --> 13:38.428
Good, because
things are getting

13:38.465 --> 13:40.592
too cozy between us as it is.

13:40.634 --> 13:42.761
You already know more
about me than you should.

13:42.803 --> 13:44.532
l don't know why
it's such a big secret

13:44.571 --> 13:45.799
that you lost your money.

13:45.839 --> 13:47.067
Well, you don't have to know.

13:47.107 --> 13:48.233
lt's my business.

13:48.275 --> 13:50.402
That's the way
l want to keep it, all right?

13:50.444 --> 13:54.904
Okay, l'll take it to the grave.

13:54.949 --> 13:56.041
You better.

14:02.623 --> 14:04.022
You should go.

14:04.124 --> 14:06.854
Not yet.

14:11.065 --> 14:14.660
As l recall, Arnold,
it was your brilliant idea

14:14.702 --> 14:16.033
to hire local tribesmen

14:16.070 --> 14:18.504
to help us with our
water purification.

14:18.539 --> 14:20.632
We were in a very remote part
of the jungle,

14:20.674 --> 14:22.369
but l had no way of knowing

14:22.409 --> 14:23.671
that people would be
so superstitious.

14:23.711 --> 14:25.804
After a few hours of digging,

14:25.846 --> 14:29.612
one of the men saw a white bird
fly over the river.

14:29.650 --> 14:31.311
And they promptly put down
their tools

14:31.352 --> 14:34.515
and went into a deep meditation
that lasted for two weeks.

14:34.555 --> 14:36.318
Those were the days, l tell you.

14:36.357 --> 14:38.518
Excuse me for interrupting,
Mr. President,

14:38.559 --> 14:40.049
but we have a
demonstration outside.

14:40.094 --> 14:42.062
l believe you'll be
more secure upstairs.

14:42.162 --> 14:43.186
A demonstration?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.197
lt's about 12 people.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.755
They look like students.

14:45.799 --> 14:47.391
Only 12?

14:47.434 --> 14:48.867
l must be losing my edge.

14:48.902 --> 14:50.563
Ferdinand, l'm, l'm so sorry.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.196
You don't have
to apologize, Arnold.

14:52.239 --> 14:55.697
Besides, l'm feeling
a little tired.

14:57.811 --> 14:59.210
Uh, good night.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.077
l'll see you off.

15:01.115 --> 15:03.276
Thank you.

15:03.317 --> 15:05.217
Quintero kills! Quintero kills!

15:05.252 --> 15:08.983
Quintero kills!
Quintero kills!

15:09.023 --> 15:10.718
Quintero kills! Quintero kills!

15:10.758 --> 15:12.726
Quintero kills!
Quintero kills!

15:12.760 --> 15:17.163
Quintero kills! Quintero kills!
Quintero kills!

15:17.197 --> 15:18.528
Quintero kills! Quintero kills!

15:18.565 --> 15:22.023
Quintero kills!
Quintero kills!

15:22.069 --> 15:25.436
Quintero kills! Quintero kills!
Quintero kills!

15:32.446 --> 15:34.346
l know people have
the right to demonstrate,

15:34.381 --> 15:36.781
but did they really have to ruin
Nando's first night here?

15:36.817 --> 15:38.045
Well, at least it
ended peacefully.

15:38.085 --> 15:41.054
Speak of the devils...

15:41.088 --> 15:42.919
President Walsh, we meet again.

15:42.956 --> 15:44.321
Gilbert and Sullivan,

15:44.358 --> 15:46.189
that was quite a show
you put on tonight.

15:46.226 --> 15:47.386
You should have been there.

15:47.428 --> 15:48.417
Josh would have been there.

15:48.462 --> 15:50.487
Actually, l was there.

15:50.531 --> 15:51.793
l was inside.

15:51.832 --> 15:53.925
Now, why doesn't
that surprise me?

15:53.967 --> 15:55.195
l was there, too.

15:55.235 --> 15:57.795
And you people are completely
wrong about Quintero.

15:57.838 --> 15:59.305
Oh, yeah?

15:59.339 --> 16:01.432
Why don't you read our latest
report on Selanesia,

16:01.475 --> 16:03.909
then come tell me
how wrong we are about him.

16:03.944 --> 16:06.469
Right. Just because it's
in print, that makes it true.

16:06.513 --> 16:08.572
You know,
for your information,

16:08.615 --> 16:11.106
Quintero is the best leader
Selanesia's ever had.

16:11.151 --> 16:12.846
l'll see you outside.

16:14.655 --> 16:17.021
Look, guys, let's try to find
some common ground here, huh?

16:17.091 --> 16:18.490
Forget it, Walsh.

16:18.525 --> 16:20.584
You're either with us or
you're in the enemy camp.

16:20.627 --> 16:22.117
You can't throw bouquets
to both sides.

16:24.231 --> 16:25.698
All right,
l'll read your pamphlet,

16:25.732 --> 16:27.791
but a little real proof
wouldn't hurt.

16:27.835 --> 16:29.029
You want real proof?

16:29.103 --> 16:30.934
l can get it for you.

16:41.181 --> 16:43.615
Yeah, tomorrow after lunch
sounds great.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.777
Okay, l like surprises.

16:45.819 --> 16:48.379
l'll see you then. Bye.

16:48.422 --> 16:50.652
Does this mean it's done,
or it needs more time?

16:52.392 --> 16:53.484
Look.

16:53.527 --> 16:54.926
l don't know.
lsn't there, like,

16:54.962 --> 16:56.930
a culinary hotline
we can call or something?

16:56.964 --> 17:00.593
Well, l'm gonna make an educated
guess and take 'em out.

17:00.634 --> 17:02.966
Valerie said
they shouldn't be overcooked.

17:04.938 --> 17:06.303
Was that Griffin on the phone?

17:06.339 --> 17:08.001
No, Ray.

17:08.108 --> 17:10.008
-Ray?
-Mm-hmm.

17:10.109 --> 17:12.010
We're going out tomorrow.

17:12.045 --> 17:13.944
But we're stealing
the bear tomorrow night

17:13.981 --> 17:15.073
with your boyfriend,
remember?

17:19.586 --> 17:20.883
l'll be there.

17:20.921 --> 17:23.753
Look, will you just cover for me
tomorrow afternoon?

17:23.790 --> 17:26.987
This is very naughty of you.

17:27.027 --> 17:28.585
What are you doing?

17:28.629 --> 17:29.357
l don't know.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.829
He's surprising me.

17:30.864 --> 17:34.425
Donna, this guy could be a mass
murderer, for all you know.

17:34.468 --> 17:36.595
Oh! Don't be ridiculous.

17:36.637 --> 17:38.605
lt's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

17:38.639 --> 17:41.506
What? l've seen him
on campus,

17:41.542 --> 17:42.975
at the Peach Pit.

17:43.010 --> 17:45.035
He even came to the TV station
today, okay?

17:45.112 --> 17:47.171
Well, then he's practically
family.

17:49.183 --> 17:50.775
l like him.

17:50.817 --> 17:52.045
l trust him.

17:52.085 --> 17:54.713
Famous last words.

18:02.663 --> 18:03.595
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:03.630 --> 18:04.688
What're you doing here?

18:04.731 --> 18:06.631
l thought you'd be
at the SU pep rally.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.294
Believe me, l'd rather
be there than here.

18:08.335 --> 18:10.132
Yeah, you and me both.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.660
Unfortunately,
my physics teacher

18:11.705 --> 18:13.366
doesn't have that
homecoming spirit,

18:13.407 --> 18:15.500
so l'll be doing laundry
and studying all weekend.

18:15.542 --> 18:17.567
Ooh, have you
ever become domestic.

18:17.611 --> 18:18.600
You're telling me.

18:18.645 --> 18:21.011
So what's the topic?

18:21.048 --> 18:22.242
Human Rights lnternational.

18:22.282 --> 18:23.476
What do you think of them?

18:23.517 --> 18:25.007
l think they're excellent.

18:25.085 --> 18:27.212
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:27.254 --> 18:28.721
'Cause they sure have
some damning things

18:28.755 --> 18:29.653
to say about Selanesia.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.520
Listen to this:

18:30.557 --> 18:32.991
''Citizens report the following

18:33.026 --> 18:35.460
''as routine police
interrogation methods:

18:35.495 --> 18:39.022
''whipping with rattan canes,
burning flesh with cigarettes,

18:39.132 --> 18:42.329
the use
of electric shocks--''

18:42.369 --> 18:44.929
to parts of the body you really
don't need to hear about...

18:44.972 --> 18:46.906
-That's disgusting.
-Yeah.

18:46.940 --> 18:49.135
Clare swears
it's all fabricated.

18:49.176 --> 18:51.144
Well, personally, l'd take

18:51.178 --> 18:52.406
whatever they say
pretty seriously.

18:52.446 --> 18:54.414
l mean, they don't have anything
on their agenda

18:54.448 --> 18:56.575
outside of protecting life.

19:01.121 --> 19:03.419
Clare, where does your father
keep the soy sauce?

19:03.457 --> 19:04.754
Oh, in the cupboard

19:04.791 --> 19:05.849
right there.

19:05.892 --> 19:07.860
He doesn't cook at all anymore.

19:07.894 --> 19:09.589
Oh, that's a shame,
a real shame.

19:09.630 --> 19:13.396
You know, your father and mother
were gourmet chefs.

19:13.433 --> 19:14.400
Well, maybe that's why.

19:14.434 --> 19:15.628
You know, he doesn't want

19:15.669 --> 19:16.863
to be reminded.

19:16.903 --> 19:19.872
But you're a reminder every day.

19:19.906 --> 19:22.534
Clare, you look more
and more like her.

19:22.576 --> 19:25.943
Excuse me, a Brandon Walsh
to see you, sir.

19:25.979 --> 19:27.606
Oh, fine. Send him in.

19:27.648 --> 19:32.108
Brandon, just in time.

19:32.152 --> 19:35.986
We need a third opinion
on this sauce.

19:36.023 --> 19:38.082
-Here.
-Thanks.

19:39.259 --> 19:40.385
lt's good.

19:40.427 --> 19:41.917
Great, that's what
we wanted to hear.

19:41.962 --> 19:44.954
Clare, get this
young man an apron.

19:44.998 --> 19:48.456
Oh, uh, you may leave us
alone, thank you.

19:48.502 --> 19:50.970
Security, it's one aspect
of this job

19:51.004 --> 19:52.494
l've never gotten used to.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.269
Fortunately, l don't have to
deal with bodyguards quite yet.

19:55.309 --> 19:58.938
Tell me, what do you have
to contend with?

19:58.979 --> 20:02.278
What do you find most difficult
as school president?

20:02.316 --> 20:04.944
Not being able
to please everyone

20:04.985 --> 20:06.646
is the hardest thing, l think.

20:06.687 --> 20:07.654
l know the feeling.

20:07.688 --> 20:09.519
l live with it every day.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.683
Which isn't to say
it doesn't hurt.

20:11.725 --> 20:14.421
Didn't seem to bother you
last night,

20:14.461 --> 20:15.723
with the demonstration and all.

20:15.762 --> 20:21.166
Brandon, a good leader
must have a thick skin.

20:21.201 --> 20:23.567
l'll remember that.

20:23.603 --> 20:25.070
There is a saying:

20:25.138 --> 20:28.539
''lf you can't take the heat,
stay out of the kitchen.''

20:28.575 --> 20:33.069
You're gonna love this,
it's wonderful.

20:33.146 --> 20:35.706
Think it's ready for MTV?

20:35.749 --> 20:37.808
Yeah, absolutely.

20:37.851 --> 20:40.012
Well, end of the show.

20:40.053 --> 20:40.985
Would you mind putting

20:41.021 --> 20:42.545
this back in the glove
compartment for me?

20:42.589 --> 20:43.578
Sure.

20:55.202 --> 20:59.798
Uh, so, so, where, where,
where are we going?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.432
lt's a surprise.

21:01.475 --> 21:05.343
ln fact, uh,
why don't you close your eyes?

21:27.401 --> 21:30.393
Donna, this guy could be a mass
murderer, for all you know.

21:30.437 --> 21:31.665
Oh, my God!

21:33.240 --> 21:34.639
lt's great, isn't it?

21:36.243 --> 21:38.541
''Pruit Family Pumpkins''?

21:38.578 --> 21:40.569
Yeah, it's a family business.

21:40.614 --> 21:43.276
l told my Aunt Marie
we'd come by and help her out.

21:43.316 --> 21:45.181
lt's prime selling season.

21:47.421 --> 21:50.356
You can't carve a pumpkin
without a good knife.

21:50.390 --> 21:51.550
Right.

21:54.961 --> 21:56.258
Hey, bud.

21:56.296 --> 21:57.320
Hey, bud.
What's going on?

21:57.364 --> 21:59.093
Well, we're doing
a virtual reenactment

21:59.199 --> 22:01.394
of the Great Mascot
Heist of '64.

22:01.435 --> 22:02.424
You're kidding.

22:02.469 --> 22:03.458
l'm telling you Brandon,

22:03.503 --> 22:04.834
lightning is going
to strike twice.

22:04.871 --> 22:05.838
Think you can make it?

22:05.872 --> 22:06.839
Uh, no promises.

22:06.873 --> 22:08.272
l've got to deal
with this right now.

22:08.308 --> 22:09.502
All right, don't work too hard.

22:09.543 --> 22:10.510
All right. Later, bud.

22:10.544 --> 22:11.511
What's going on, Kaye?

22:11.545 --> 22:12.842
Want to go
for another round?

22:12.879 --> 22:14.346
No.

22:14.381 --> 22:16.542
l thought l'd take you up on
your ''common ground'' idea.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.710
Brandon Walsh,
this is Mawn Yoto.

22:18.752 --> 22:20.049
l've seen you around campus.

22:20.153 --> 22:21.450
You do the gardening, right?

22:22.722 --> 22:24.189
Can we go in your office?

22:24.224 --> 22:26.055
Sure.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.024
So what's all this about?

22:36.069 --> 22:37.434
You said you needed proof.

22:37.471 --> 22:39.405
Mawn is from Selanesia.

22:39.439 --> 22:40.838
His brother edited
a newspaper there,

22:40.874 --> 22:42.671
wrote some stuff, critical
stuff about the government.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.075
Quintero wanted to
have him shut up.

22:45.145 --> 22:46.373
ls this true?

22:46.413 --> 22:47.880
Mawn was grabbed by the police

22:47.914 --> 22:50.075
when he was at the market,
and ordered to say

22:50.150 --> 22:52.243
his brother planted a bomb
in a government building.

22:52.285 --> 22:55.254
When he refused,
they tortured him.

22:55.288 --> 22:56.915
Wait a second,
whose story is this?

22:56.957 --> 22:58.049
Can't he speak for himself?

22:59.493 --> 23:01.154
lt's okay, you can trust him.

23:02.929 --> 23:05.557
They questioned me every day.

23:05.599 --> 23:08.568
When l wouldn't cooperate,
they beat me.

23:08.602 --> 23:09.830
Over and over again.

23:09.870 --> 23:11.963
After a week

23:12.005 --> 23:14.030
l couldn't stand it anymore.

23:14.140 --> 23:18.042
l signed a statement
against my brother.

23:18.078 --> 23:20.444
We found him
by the side of a road.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.072
Shot in the head.

23:25.385 --> 23:26.784
l can't believe it.

23:27.554 --> 23:28.953
Show him, Mawn.

23:33.426 --> 23:35.018
Look.

23:40.934 --> 23:43.926
Quintero himself
ordered this done.

23:47.607 --> 23:49.541
Now are you ready to help us?

23:55.615 --> 23:59.176
What do you want me to do?

24:11.531 --> 24:15.900
Aunt Marie, will you ring
this up for these folks here?

24:15.936 --> 24:17.267
Happy Halloween.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.299
So, what do you think?

24:24.344 --> 24:25.675
You're a natural.

24:25.712 --> 24:29.580
Hey, l've been making
jack-o-lanterns for years.

24:29.616 --> 24:31.277
Roasting the seeds,
making pumpkin pie,

24:31.318 --> 24:32.751
all ritual at the Martin house.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.048
Well, around here,

24:34.120 --> 24:36.418
the animals get first crack
at the pumpkin food.

24:36.456 --> 24:38.048
Have you seen
the petting zoo yet?

24:38.158 --> 24:40.023
No. Aunt Marie put me
right to work.

24:40.060 --> 24:42.290
Well, come on,
it's feeding time.

24:42.329 --> 24:44.194
Oh, actually,
it's getting pretty late.

24:44.230 --> 24:45.993
Maybe l better skip it.

24:46.032 --> 24:47.021
Donna...

24:47.067 --> 24:49.228
Donna, how many
newborn goats

24:49.269 --> 24:52.796
-have you seen in your life?
-None that l can think of.

24:52.839 --> 24:55.273
How often do you get to
feed a mean old billy goat

24:55.308 --> 24:56.400
back home in Beverly Hills?

24:56.443 --> 24:58.070
Never.

24:58.178 --> 25:00.578
Then you gotta come over
and check this out.

25:00.614 --> 25:03.777
Okay, l guess l could be
fashionably late, right?

25:14.260 --> 25:15.488
There you go.
That should support you.

25:15.528 --> 25:16.620
The bait.

25:18.398 --> 25:19.763
The disguises,

25:19.799 --> 25:21.824
The very pricey, high-tech,
military surplus gadgets

25:21.868 --> 25:23.392
that l bought on
credit card.

25:23.436 --> 25:25.028
-Cool.
-Hey, don't touch that,

25:25.071 --> 25:26.663
l want to return
this stuff in the morning.

25:26.706 --> 25:28.674
And, our secret weapon.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.505
Have we got all
of our bases covered?

25:30.543 --> 25:31.771
l believe so.

25:31.811 --> 25:33.711
Great.
Now all we need is Donna.

25:33.747 --> 25:35.339
She's better not
be flaking on us.

25:35.382 --> 25:36.713
l haven't heard
from her all day.

25:36.750 --> 25:40.413
Uh, she got tied up,
but she'll be here.

25:40.453 --> 25:42.182
Well, a good spy
has to be punctual.

25:42.222 --> 25:44.713
Steve, Donna is
not a good spy.

25:44.758 --> 25:46.316
She's a very
reluctant spy, actually.

25:46.359 --> 25:47.917
Well, then why don't
we do this without her.

25:47.961 --> 25:49.360
Do you guys think
you can handle this?

25:49.396 --> 25:51.330
Why not?

25:51.364 --> 25:52.490
We can give it a try.

25:55.268 --> 25:56.997
Any of these safe to eat?

25:57.037 --> 25:58.902
Well, yeah, if you want
to spend the night

25:58.938 --> 26:00.064
in the bathroom
with the squirts.

26:00.173 --> 26:02.038
l'll pass.

26:05.612 --> 26:07.580
A federal subpoena...

26:07.614 --> 26:09.343
for Ferdinando Quintero?

26:09.382 --> 26:11.680
What are you doing with this?

26:11.718 --> 26:14.516
Human Rights lnternational
has filed a civil suit

26:14.554 --> 26:16.852
against him, on behalf of
this gardener at the school.

26:16.890 --> 26:19.518
This will keep him in the U.S.
to face the charges.

26:19.559 --> 26:21.959
Well, good.
Let the courts sort it out.

26:21.995 --> 26:25.726
Yeah, but there's a problem.

26:25.765 --> 26:27.960
Quintero's security
won't let anyone near enough

26:28.001 --> 26:29.025
to serve the paper.

26:29.102 --> 26:30.626
So what does this
got to do with you?

26:30.670 --> 26:33.969
They want me to serve it.

26:34.007 --> 26:37.135
They know l have access.

26:37.177 --> 26:39.509
They know he trusts me.

26:39.546 --> 26:40.638
Brandon, this goes way beyond

26:40.680 --> 26:42.739
helping out some campus
political group.

26:42.782 --> 26:44.181
We're talking about
a head of state, here.

26:44.217 --> 26:45.411
l know Dad, but l've seen

26:45.452 --> 26:46.919
the scars on this guy,
they're real.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.046
Honey, l just don't
think you should

26:49.155 --> 26:51.020
get yourself
mixed up in this.

26:51.057 --> 26:52.922
-For your own security.
-Tell me about it.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.587
Quintero's got some pretty
hardcore bodyguards.

26:55.628 --> 26:57.687
You don't have to do this.

26:57.731 --> 26:59.892
l know l don't
have to do it, Dad,

26:59.933 --> 27:01.161
but if l don't do it,

27:01.201 --> 27:02.668
then l really am the
Chancellor's lackey.

27:02.702 --> 27:04.897
Brandon, this is crazy.

27:04.938 --> 27:06.200
You're just a student.

27:06.239 --> 27:08.730
And who do you think was
standing in front of the tanks

27:08.775 --> 27:09.901
in Tiananmen Square, Mom.

27:09.943 --> 27:11.672
Who toppled the Berlin Wall?

27:11.711 --> 27:13.178
Students just like me.

27:13.213 --> 27:17.172
lt sounds to me like you've
already made up your mind.

27:19.419 --> 27:23.048
Yeah, l guess l have.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.038
Excuse me, do you have change
for a dollar.

27:43.143 --> 27:45.543
Well, normally l'm very stingy
with my quarters,

27:45.578 --> 27:48.138
but l just put in
my last load, so...

27:48.181 --> 27:49.648
Thanks.

27:49.682 --> 27:51.775
lt's tough to find a generous
soul in a place like this.

27:51.818 --> 27:53.217
lt's a dog-eat-dog

27:53.253 --> 27:55.653
when it comes to pay laundry
service, isn't it?

27:55.688 --> 27:57.747
-No, no, please.
-Take it,

27:57.791 --> 27:59.281
No.

27:59.325 --> 28:00.849
l owe you a cup of coffee,

28:00.894 --> 28:02.589
Okay.

28:02.629 --> 28:04.256
Are you premed?

28:04.297 --> 28:06.458
Med, actually. At UCLA.

28:06.499 --> 28:08.899
l'm studying to be
a doctor, too.

28:08.935 --> 28:11.904
-Pediatrics?
-Maybe. Why?

28:11.938 --> 28:15.374
Well, you, uh, you seem
to have a way with kids.

28:15.408 --> 28:18.002
Well, l'm learning.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.672
So, we're a couple of wild
students, aren't we?

28:20.713 --> 28:22.271
Laundry and baby-sitting
on a Friday night.

28:23.817 --> 28:25.341
Baby-sitting?

28:25.385 --> 28:27.250
You are responsible for
this child, aren't you?

28:27.287 --> 28:30.654
You're not just rocking a
perfect stranger to sleep?

28:30.690 --> 28:32.658
No. No, l'm definitely
responsible for Hannah.

28:32.692 --> 28:34.887
Well, hi there, Hannah.

28:37.030 --> 28:38.019
Hey Hannah,

28:38.097 --> 28:39.394
what's your baby-sitter's name?

28:43.236 --> 28:44.601
My name's Andrea.

28:44.637 --> 28:47.936
Peter.

28:47.974 --> 28:51.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:51.044 --> 28:53.171
Well, pull up a washer, Andrea--

28:53.213 --> 28:56.740
l've got a spin cycle
or two to kill.

28:56.783 --> 29:00.617
l never thought l'd find such
good company in the Laundromat.

29:00.653 --> 29:05.181
You're just saying that because
you want some more quarters.

29:05.225 --> 29:07.216
Right.

29:13.666 --> 29:15.429
Shh.

29:20.006 --> 29:22.372
All right, remember guys,
no guts no glory.

29:22.408 --> 29:23.534
Give me a test.

29:23.576 --> 29:24.600
Testing, one, two, three.

29:24.644 --> 29:25.941
You're set.

29:25.979 --> 29:27.844
Okay, we'll signal when
we've done the deed.

29:27.881 --> 29:29.314
Ready, Kel?

29:29.349 --> 29:31.817
l guess this is what's known
as ''the old college try.''

29:31.851 --> 29:32.875
Go get 'em, girls.

29:40.493 --> 29:42.324
Hi, guys.

29:42.362 --> 29:43.624
Anyone for brownies?

29:43.663 --> 29:45.255
Hey, well,
that's nice of you.

29:45.298 --> 29:48.426
Well, we were just at our
meeting and we were talking.

29:48.468 --> 29:50.561
And we think you
guys deserve a reward

29:50.603 --> 29:52.434
for taking such
good care of Bruno.

29:52.472 --> 29:53.461
What meeting?

29:54.607 --> 29:56.040
The Alphas.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.370
Oh, really?

29:57.410 --> 29:59.207
You know my cousin's
an Alpha, Kira Lewis.

29:59.245 --> 30:01.338
-Kira is a good friend of ours.
-Yeah.

30:01.381 --> 30:04.373
Cool. Thanks.

30:04.417 --> 30:07.443
You know, the cook should
always have the first bite.

30:07.487 --> 30:09.819
l mean, it's only fair.

30:09.856 --> 30:12.552
Please. l logged enough
calories just licking the bowl.

30:12.592 --> 30:15.755
l break out in horrible hives
when l eat chocolate.

30:16.963 --> 30:17.827
Oh.

30:17.864 --> 30:20.196
Too bad.

30:20.233 --> 30:22.565
You know, my
girlfriend's an Alpha.

30:22.602 --> 30:24.593
She didn't say anything
about a meeting tonight.

30:24.637 --> 30:28.437
Well, uh...

30:28.474 --> 30:29.907
Okay, you caught us.

30:29.943 --> 30:31.570
We really didn't bake

30:31.611 --> 30:33.875
these brownies for you.

30:33.913 --> 30:35.642
We baked them for
the Alpha meeting

30:35.682 --> 30:37.912
we thought we had tonight.

30:37.951 --> 30:39.612
So they're secondhand
brownies, okay.

30:39.652 --> 30:41.711
But they're still
homemade by us,

30:41.754 --> 30:44.780
and it would really
hurt our feelings

30:44.824 --> 30:46.553
if you didn't at least have one.

30:56.569 --> 30:58.036
There you go.

30:58.071 --> 30:59.504
Thanks. l'll take two.

31:16.689 --> 31:18.350
Hey.

31:18.391 --> 31:21.656
She is just about the
sweetest thing l've ever seen.

31:21.694 --> 31:24.219
l don't want to leave here.

31:24.263 --> 31:26.390
Well, you can stay
as long as you want.

31:26.432 --> 31:27.865
We're on a long-term lease.

31:30.036 --> 31:32.061
lt's so nice here, but what
happens after Halloween?

31:32.171 --> 31:35.004
Well, next big rush
is Christmas.

31:35.041 --> 31:40.172
And then there's craft fairs,
swap meets, nothing fancy.

31:40.213 --> 31:43.671
Well, sometimes fancy
is overrated.

31:46.886 --> 31:48.649
Yeah, sometimes.

31:50.023 --> 31:51.615
Well, l guess l
made you pretty late

31:51.657 --> 31:53.488
for whatever you had
planned tonight, huh?

31:53.526 --> 31:56.927
Yeah, a little more than that.

31:56.963 --> 31:58.624
l think l missed it altogether.

31:58.664 --> 32:01.394
Are you sorry?

32:03.069 --> 32:05.230
Not really.

32:23.389 --> 32:25.823
So when are you going to
invite me to a power dinner

32:25.858 --> 32:27.917
with your father
and world leaders?

32:27.960 --> 32:30.428
Be careful what you ask for,
it might come true.

32:30.463 --> 32:31.953
Well, l wouldn't mind.

32:31.998 --> 32:34.694
l mean, don't you think it's
about time l met your father?

32:34.734 --> 32:36.759
He's met Brandon enough times.

32:36.803 --> 32:38.236
Sure.

32:38.271 --> 32:39.636
We'll do it soon, okay?

32:39.672 --> 32:40.696
Hey, guys.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.230
Hey, Brandon.
Kelly's out.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.264
Yeah, l know.

32:43.309 --> 32:45.072
Actually, l came to talk to you.

32:45.144 --> 32:47.772
Well, don't let me
get in your way.

32:47.814 --> 32:49.111
Thanks, bro.

32:52.919 --> 32:55.911
l don't believe
what you're telling me.

32:55.955 --> 32:57.923
lt's something l got to do.

32:57.957 --> 33:01.358
Ruining the career of a man
who has done you no harm,

33:01.394 --> 33:04.329
who's laid up with cancer,
for God's sake...

33:04.363 --> 33:06.661
this is something
you have to do?

33:06.699 --> 33:09.031
Clare, if you met this
gardener, you'd understand.

33:09.068 --> 33:10.660
Doesn't it mean anything to you

33:10.703 --> 33:12.568
that Nando is our
closest family friend?

33:12.605 --> 33:14.505
Yes, it does--
that's why l'm here.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.030
Oh, isn't that big of you.

33:16.142 --> 33:19.475
Did you really expect me
to be appeased that easily?

33:19.512 --> 33:21.173
No, l didn't expect that.

33:21.214 --> 33:23.910
Well, l certainly hope not,
'cause you'd be dead wrong.

33:23.950 --> 33:26.578
And l'm telling you
right now, Brandon,

33:26.619 --> 33:31.022
if you do this, l am never
gonna speak to you again.

33:33.059 --> 33:35.960
Well, then l guess
we won't be speaking.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.995
Am l in the wrong apartment?

34:11.831 --> 34:13.856
No. This is the place.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.958
Aren't you supposed
to be mixing

34:16.002 --> 34:17.764
gin and tonics
at Doheny's?

34:17.803 --> 34:21.136
And making eyes
at the female clientele.

34:21.174 --> 34:23.438
Right.

34:23.476 --> 34:24.966
Well...

34:25.011 --> 34:27.002
l had the overwhelming urge

34:27.045 --> 34:30.538
to stay home tonight and
make eyes at you instead.

34:30.583 --> 34:34.143
Mm. So you're, uh,
playing hooky?

34:34.187 --> 34:36.382
Yup.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.949
And you are going
to play with me.

34:39.992 --> 34:42.755
Let me just put
this little lady to bed.

34:42.795 --> 34:45.958
Come on, let's go, sweet pea.

34:45.998 --> 34:47.522
Oh, yeah.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.933
And then the real fun begins.

34:52.871 --> 34:54.635
Bring it on.

35:18.931 --> 35:20.421
Wh-What was that you said?

35:20.466 --> 35:22.991
l said, do you think we're
gonna beat CU tomorrow?

35:23.035 --> 35:24.434
Hey, Ted, stay here, man--
l got to go to the bathroom.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.437
Oh, man, so do l.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.438
Something wrong, guys?

35:26.472 --> 35:28.030
Uh, no, no.

35:28.140 --> 35:29.607
-l'll be right back.
-Yeah, me, too.

35:29.642 --> 35:30.631
What about the bear?

35:30.676 --> 35:32.337
Man, they can watch the bear.
Won't you?

35:32.378 --> 35:34.346
No problem.

35:35.581 --> 35:37.776
Sounds like the brownies
are taking their toll.

35:43.356 --> 35:45.950
Yeah! lt's a done deal!

35:58.604 --> 36:00.765
Brandon Walsh to
see Chancellor...

36:00.806 --> 36:02.967
Chancellor Arnold's
expecting you.

36:15.988 --> 36:17.979
Good evening, sir.

36:20.126 --> 36:23.118
You shouldn't have involved
Clare in this, Brandon.

36:23.162 --> 36:25.494
She told you l
was coming, huh?

36:27.667 --> 36:29.396
l'm disappointed in you.

36:29.435 --> 36:31.494
Well, l'm sorry
to hear that, sir,

36:31.537 --> 36:34.199
but how do you explain being
friends with a murderer?

36:34.240 --> 36:35.502
Oh, Brandon, Brandon,

36:35.541 --> 36:38.339
it's not that simple.

36:38.377 --> 36:40.607
When Quintero
asked me to head up

36:40.646 --> 36:42.477
the economic reform
in his country,

36:42.515 --> 36:45.848
l knew that he was offering me
the power to improve the lives

36:45.885 --> 36:47.147
of literally millions of people.

36:47.186 --> 36:48.585
But at what cost?

36:48.621 --> 36:50.646
How many people were
killed in the process?

36:50.690 --> 36:52.885
Believe me, l asked myself
all the hard questions,

36:52.925 --> 36:55.894
and l chose to compromise
out of what l've got to believe

36:55.928 --> 36:58.021
was a bigger cause.

36:58.064 --> 36:59.895
Excuse me.

37:04.537 --> 37:09.099
What my good old friend
is trying to say is...

37:09.141 --> 37:12.304
that is the price
you pay for democracy.

37:12.345 --> 37:15.542
With all due respect, sir,
your country is not a democracy.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.811
When my country is
as old as yours,

37:17.850 --> 37:20.182
then we will see how
history judges us,

37:20.219 --> 37:22.847
but until then...

37:24.223 --> 37:28.751
President Walsh, l understand
you have something for me.

37:39.205 --> 37:40.638
Thank you.

37:40.673 --> 37:43.005
That wasn't so hard, was it?

37:45.244 --> 37:47.041
l'm sorry.

37:47.079 --> 37:48.569
Don't be.

37:48.614 --> 37:52.050
You did what you had to do...

37:52.151 --> 37:54.210
just like l did.

37:54.253 --> 37:56.653
And you'll see...

37:56.689 --> 38:00.147
there's always a price.

38:09.635 --> 38:13.469
So, are you gonna be in
the doghouse with your friends?

38:13.506 --> 38:14.905
Yeah, probably.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.908
Well, you could blame it on me.

38:16.942 --> 38:19.308
Well, you did have
something to do with it.

38:19.345 --> 38:21.142
You know,
l'm usually very responsible.

38:21.180 --> 38:23.580
l don't know what
came over me tonight.

38:23.616 --> 38:26.813
Well, whatever it is,
it suits you.

38:26.852 --> 38:28.251
Thank you.

38:28.287 --> 38:29.914
Donna, listen, uh...

38:29.955 --> 38:31.684
l'm not gonna call you again.

38:34.627 --> 38:36.151
You're not?

38:36.195 --> 38:40.188
No, l'm gonna wait to hear
from you this time.

38:40.232 --> 38:41.961
Oh.

38:42.001 --> 38:43.662
Okay.

38:45.938 --> 38:48.304
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:59.885 --> 39:00.909
Valerie?

39:00.953 --> 39:03.444
ln the bathroom.

39:03.489 --> 39:05.787
Oh, you're going out
again tonight?

39:05.825 --> 39:08.988
Yeah, Steve and l are gonna
celebrate a little bit longer.

39:09.094 --> 39:11.426
Uh, l thought
l just saw him leave.

39:11.464 --> 39:14.262
Yeah, he, uh, he had to get back
to the fraternity house.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.494
Oh.

39:15.534 --> 39:18.662
Do you think l could borrow
the car to meet him?

39:18.704 --> 39:20.672
Yeah, sure-- the
keys are downstairs.

39:20.706 --> 39:21.798
Thanks.

39:21.841 --> 39:23.832
-Have a good time.
-l will.

39:31.951 --> 39:36.012
-Hi.
-Hi.

39:36.055 --> 39:37.886
Same time, same station.

39:37.923 --> 39:40.289
Yeah, l c-can't do it tonight.

39:40.326 --> 39:42.157
What do you mean?

39:42.194 --> 39:43.718
Tonight's no good.

39:43.762 --> 39:45.320
Well, l don't get it.

39:45.364 --> 39:47.764
Well, you're a smart girl, Val--
figure it out.

39:56.308 --> 39:57.935
Who is she?

39:57.977 --> 39:59.467
Nobody you'd know.

39:59.512 --> 40:02.037
Eh, she's nobody l know, really.

40:02.081 --> 40:03.605
Thanks a lot, Dylan.

40:03.649 --> 40:05.708
Look, don't start that
with me, all right?

40:05.751 --> 40:07.810
lt's not like we're a
steady thing, remember?

40:07.853 --> 40:10.014
And you don't let me
forget it for a second.

40:18.030 --> 40:19.998
ln international news,

40:20.032 --> 40:22.500
Ferdinand Quintero,
President of Selanesia,

40:22.535 --> 40:25.993
announced that he will resign
his post due to health reasons.

40:26.038 --> 40:28.006
He is presently in Los Angeles

40:28.040 --> 40:30.440
receiving treatment
for advanced liver cancer.

40:30.476 --> 40:32.444
Nothing about the subpoena.

40:32.478 --> 40:35.345
l guess they're trying
to keep it under wraps.

40:35.381 --> 40:37.349
How'd he take it last night?

40:37.383 --> 40:39.817
Gracefully. l think
he knows by the time

40:39.852 --> 40:42.320
the case actually goes to
court, he'll be long gone.

40:42.354 --> 40:43.821
He's that sick?

40:43.856 --> 40:45.483
Yeah, l don't think
he's got long, Mom.

40:45.524 --> 40:46.513
Coming up in sports--

40:46.559 --> 40:49.619
the SCU mascot
mysteriously disappears

40:49.662 --> 40:53.189
on the day of the big game
against rival CU.

41:00.272 --> 41:01.330
Okay, okay, okay.

41:01.373 --> 41:04.206
Okay. On behalf
of the Greek Council

41:04.243 --> 41:06.040
and in honor our homecoming,

41:06.145 --> 41:09.012
my cochair Kelly Taylor and l
are very pleased to present

41:09.048 --> 41:11.676
a very special
transfer student from SCU.

41:11.717 --> 41:12.684
Kelly.

41:12.718 --> 41:15.744
Please welcome Bruno the Bear!

41:32.471 --> 41:34.166
You know, l missed you
last night.

41:34.206 --> 41:36.902
Oh, well, it looks like
you guys did great without me.

41:36.942 --> 41:38.807
l didn't say ''we,'' l said ''l.''

41:38.844 --> 41:40.004
l missed you.

41:40.045 --> 41:43.276
Aw... Well, l missed you, too.

41:43.315 --> 41:44.407
Hey, you know, Steve's father

41:44.450 --> 41:45.781
should be pretty impressed
with this.

41:45.818 --> 41:48.048
Or threatened--
they're so competitive.

41:48.087 --> 41:50.055
Unlike us, huh?

41:50.089 --> 41:53.286
l guess l have been
kind of hard on you.

41:53.325 --> 41:55.316
But after last night,

41:55.361 --> 41:58.956
l think it's time to make you
an honorary Alpha member.

41:58.998 --> 42:00.363
Really?

42:00.399 --> 42:01.696
Thanks.

42:01.734 --> 42:03.429
You're welcome.

42:03.469 --> 42:06.734
Steve, if l had a hat on,
it would be off to you, brother.

42:06.772 --> 42:08.171
Well, thank you
very much, brother.

42:08.207 --> 42:09.504
David, Clare, come here!

42:09.541 --> 42:10.508
Hey, buddy.

42:10.542 --> 42:11.474
What's going on, man?
How you doing?

42:11.510 --> 42:12.534
All right, all right.

42:12.578 --> 42:14.341
Hey, you guys missed
the unveiling.

42:14.380 --> 42:15.608
Yeah, well, l've been, uh,

42:15.648 --> 42:17.377
talking Clare into
coming to the game.

42:17.416 --> 42:18.405
Hi.

42:20.152 --> 42:23.053
l'm sorry, did-did you
just say something to me?

42:23.155 --> 42:26.682
Well, if Nando's still talking
to my dad after he let you in,

42:26.725 --> 42:29.489
l guess l can still
talk to you, too.

42:29.528 --> 42:32.190
l can't say l'm sorry.

42:32.231 --> 42:34.495
Well, my dad taught me something

42:34.533 --> 42:37.434
about separating
friendship from politics.

42:37.469 --> 42:38.766
Yeah, me, too.

42:38.804 --> 42:40.066
Hey, guys!

42:40.172 --> 42:42.197
lf you're gonna talk
about politics all day long,

42:42.241 --> 42:43.333
we're gonna miss the kickoff.

42:43.375 --> 42:44.740
Come on, everybody,
to the field!

42:52.518 --> 42:54.076
Wow!

42:54.153 --> 42:56.018
You know what,
you go ahead without me.

42:56.055 --> 42:57.215
l'll catch up with you.

42:57.256 --> 42:58.484
Okay.

43:06.365 --> 43:07.832
Hey. How you doing?

43:07.866 --> 43:10.198
Better than l have been
in a long time.

43:10.235 --> 43:12.203
You're a brave boy, Brandon,

43:12.237 --> 43:14.034
just like my brother was.

43:14.073 --> 43:15.233
Thank you.

43:15.274 --> 43:17.037
Thank you for everything.

43:17.142 --> 43:18.336
You bet.

43:18.377 --> 43:19.469
Take care.

43:19.511 --> 43:20.773
Thank you.
