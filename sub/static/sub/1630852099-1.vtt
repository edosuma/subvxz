02:05.205 --> 02:07.527
PART ONE

03:17.677 --> 03:18.799
Julianne?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.926
Gabriel...

03:26.006 --> 03:27.007
Gabriel!

03:27.647 --> 03:28.648
I’m here.

03:33.894 --> 03:35.055
Are you all right?

03:36.817 --> 03:37.858
I had a nightmare.

03:39.339 --> 03:41.021
I was in the orchard.

03:41.101 --> 03:45.786
We made love under the stars
and I fell asleep in your arms.

03:45.866 --> 03:48.028
When I woke up you were gone.

03:57.716 --> 03:59.399
I love you, Beatrice.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.523
I’m not going to leave you.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.062
Do you regret last night?

04:22.903 --> 04:23.984
No.

04:25.105 --> 04:27.027
I’m glad you were my first.

04:27.828 --> 04:30.310
I’m honored to have been your first.

04:32.352 --> 04:34.034
I want to be your last.

04:46.566 --> 04:49.009
I thought she wasn’t gonna
call you anymore.

04:50.730 --> 04:52.893
I’m not answering,
so it doesn’t matter

04:56.776 --> 04:58.498
In my bed there’s only us.

05:04.384 --> 05:06.226
I haven’t brushed my teeth.

05:07.707 --> 05:08.708
I don’t care.

05:09.469 --> 05:11.471
I’d like to clean up first.

05:13.753 --> 05:16.036
Don’t let Paulina ruin what we have.

05:16.877 --> 05:17.878
I’m not.

05:25.085 --> 05:27.327
I need the sheet to make the bed.

05:33.974 --> 05:35.015
What’s the problem?

05:38.058 --> 05:39.379
Don’t be shy.

05:43.503 --> 05:46.826
If I had my wish,
you’d never wear clothes again.

06:53.493 --> 06:54.614
You're frigid.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.658
You're gonna be a lousy lay.

07:21.001 --> 07:22.722
My dearest Julianne,

07:22.802 --> 07:25.645
Thank you for your immeasurable gift.

07:25.725 --> 07:28.888
The only thing
I have of value is my heart.

07:28.969 --> 07:31.171
It’s yours, Gabriel.

07:47.307 --> 07:49.229
Why, hello there.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.194
Thank you for the flowers.
They’re beautiful.

07:55.395 --> 07:56.516
You’re welcome...

07:59.319 --> 08:00.720
You look troubled.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.323
Is it about Paulina?

08:04.484 --> 08:07.087
I’m upset she’s calling you, but no.

08:08.328 --> 08:10.050
Thank you for the card.

08:10.130 --> 08:12.012
It said what I desperately
wanted to hear.

08:13.213 --> 08:14.214
I’m glad...

08:15.775 --> 08:16.976
What’s bothering you?

08:21.221 --> 08:23.263
Was last night everything
you’d hoped for?

08:25.425 --> 08:26.986
That’s a strange question.

08:29.669 --> 08:31.711
I know it had to be different for you.

08:31.791 --> 08:33.313
I wasn’t very...

08:34.514 --> 08:36.036
active.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.119
Active?

08:39.198 --> 08:41.760
I didn’t do much to please you.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.445
You pleased me a great deal.

08:47.047 --> 08:51.131
I know you were nervous,
but I really enjoyed myself.

08:55.455 --> 08:58.338
We belong to one another
in every way now.

08:59.379 --> 09:02.062
I demanded we switch positions.

09:02.862 --> 09:04.664
You didn’t demand, you asked.

09:06.586 --> 09:08.948
I’d like you to demand things of me.

09:10.070 --> 09:14.594
I want to know you want me
as desperately as I want you.

09:18.238 --> 09:19.919
I know you dreamed
about your first time

09:19.999 --> 09:23.243
being a certain way
and I really wanted to give you that,

09:23.323 --> 09:24.724
but I was worried.

09:27.127 --> 09:28.608
Yesterday was a first for me too.

09:33.653 --> 09:35.014
You ordered a feast.

09:36.096 --> 09:37.817
I awoke ravenous this morning...

09:42.302 --> 09:43.303
Open.

09:47.507 --> 09:48.588
Are you happy?

09:58.878 --> 10:01.921
When I was in college
the girls would tell awful stories

10:02.001 --> 10:03.203
about their first times.

10:04.804 --> 10:08.368
Most of their boyfriends
just grunted and finished quickly.

10:11.171 --> 10:14.053
I decided it would be better
to have a chaste affair

10:14.134 --> 10:17.417
of the heart and mind
rather than a sexual relationship.

10:18.738 --> 10:22.021
I doubted I’d find anyone
who could give me both.

10:24.224 --> 10:28.027
And now I’m in a relationship
with a sex god

10:28.107 --> 10:32.832
and I can’t give him anything
like the pleasure he gives me.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.557
Sex god?

10:40.039 --> 10:42.001
Teach me.

10:42.081 --> 10:44.524
I promise if you are patient,
I’ll improve.

10:53.693 --> 10:55.295
You gave me something...

10:57.297 --> 10:59.859
that I’ve never experienced before.

11:02.101 --> 11:04.344
Love and sex.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.588
You are the only one

11:09.989 --> 11:13.433
who's ever been my lover
in the truest sense.

11:15.034 --> 11:16.956
Your allurements and my...

11:20.800 --> 11:22.161
my anticipation...

11:24.804 --> 11:27.607
were like nothing
I’ve experienced in my life.

11:32.572 --> 11:37.217
Add to that the experience
of making love for the first time.

11:49.429 --> 11:50.430
Words fail me.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.275
You were very gentle.

11:59.999 --> 12:02.762
You loved me with more
than just your body.

12:05.164 --> 12:06.326
Thank you.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.252
How do you feel?

12:14.574 --> 12:16.055
A little sore.

12:19.178 --> 12:20.940
Then maybe we should wait.

12:21.180 --> 12:22.221
No!

12:26.466 --> 12:31.511
I want you to look into my eyes
and tell me that you love me

12:31.591 --> 12:33.273
as you move inside me.

12:37.236 --> 12:39.639
I’ll remember that
for as long as I live.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.293
This morning you were a little bit shy.

12:55.094 --> 12:59.258
I’ll probably always be a little bit shy
to be naked in front of you.

13:01.020 --> 13:02.502
Are you cold?

13:03.503 --> 13:05.505
Not while you’re holding me...

13:09.228 --> 13:10.870
Someone might see us.

13:10.950 --> 13:14.594
And nobody gets to see
this beautiful body except for me...

13:17.156 --> 13:21.080
Although our neighbors might hear you

13:21.160 --> 13:22.562
for the next few hours.

13:26.005 --> 13:30.530
My goal is to see
how many times I can please you

13:30.610 --> 13:33.092
until I can’t hold myself back anymore.

13:34.334 --> 13:35.895
I like the sound of that.

13:39.258 --> 13:40.259
Me too.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.415
- Buona sera.
- Buona sera.

14:19.899 --> 14:20.900
You look stunning.

14:21.581 --> 14:22.702
And thank you for my gift.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.666
Now everyone will know
that we belong to each other.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.951
Thank you for my dress.

14:32.912 --> 14:33.913
I love it.

14:37.557 --> 14:38.798
And your shoes...

14:41.601 --> 14:42.762
Nice, aren't they?

14:43.443 --> 14:44.964
They’re a good deal more than nice.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.450
If I like your lecture,
Professor Emerson,

14:50.530 --> 14:52.091
perhaps I’ll wear them after.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.615
I’ll see that you like my lecture,
Ms. Mitchell.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.578
Even if I have to deliver it
to you personally,

14:58.658 --> 14:59.899
between the sheets.

15:24.764 --> 15:26.766
Professore... professore...

15:26.846 --> 15:28.527
I’m afraid we have need
of you immediately!

15:28.848 --> 15:30.610
Ms. Mitchell has a reserved seat.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.412
Yes, Professore.
Shall I accompany your fidanzata?

15:41.781 --> 15:43.743
Shall we go, lady? Thank you.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.567
This way...

17:00.580 --> 17:02.622
Ms. Mitchell, you'll sit here.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.864
- Grazie.
- You're welcome.

17:19.157 --> 17:20.159
Professore...

17:20.239 --> 17:21.656
- We should start now.
- Okay, thank you very much.

17:21.681 --> 17:22.682
You're welcome.

17:27.767 --> 17:28.768
Good evening.

17:33.573 --> 17:37.577
Tonight I will be speaking to you
about Sandro Boticelli's muse.

17:38.217 --> 17:39.859
La Bella Simonetta.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.823
I'm tackling this controversial topic

17:43.903 --> 17:46.666
choosing Botticelli's art work
as a representation

17:46.746 --> 17:50.189
of various female archetypes.

17:50.269 --> 17:54.674
We begin Dante's muse
and the figure of Beatrice.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.358
She's the ideal of feminine perfection

17:59.438 --> 18:02.521
and was intelligent and compassionate,

18:02.602 --> 18:06.726
and vibrant with the kind of self-love
that can only come from God.

18:07.727 --> 18:11.290
She inspires Dante to be a better man.

18:13.452 --> 18:16.776
Now, consider the face
of the goddess Venus.

18:16.976 --> 18:22.221
It appears Venus has Beatrice’s face.

18:22.301 --> 18:25.825
They represent two ideal types,

18:25.905 --> 18:28.587
one theological and one secular.

18:28.668 --> 18:33.112
Beatrice is lover of the soul.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.997
Venus is the lover of the body.

18:48.007 --> 18:52.331
Botticelli’s La Bella has both faces.

18:52.411 --> 18:56.575
One of sacrificial love
and one of eros...

18:58.137 --> 19:03.422
Even though Venus
represents sexual love,

19:03.502 --> 19:06.465
she maintains a venerable modesty,

19:07.506 --> 19:11.711
clutching part of her hair
to cover herself.

19:14.553 --> 19:19.358
Her shyness increases
the eroticism of her portrayal.

19:19.438 --> 19:20.880
It doesn’t diminish it.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.044
Many people fail to see
how modesty and...

19:26.806 --> 19:32.571
and sweetness of temper
compound erotic appeal.

19:36.736 --> 19:38.778
Grazie. Thank you.

19:39.618 --> 19:41.100
Grazie. Thank you.

21:03.943 --> 21:05.544
Ti piace questo quadro?

21:06.505 --> 21:08.027
Sì... molto.

21:09.628 --> 21:10.990
I am Giuseppe Pacciani.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.631
Julia Mitchell.

21:13.112 --> 21:14.153
Enchanted.

21:16.355 --> 21:18.437
Your beauty rivals
that of La Bella Simonetta.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.561
A drink?

21:30.689 --> 21:31.811
Salute.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.737
I'm a professor of Literature
at the university. And you?

21:38.818 --> 21:41.861
I study Dante
at The University of Toronto.

21:41.941 --> 21:43.983
Ah, il Poeta.

21:44.743 --> 21:46.665
My specialization is Dante also.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.870
One of my former students
is studying there now.

21:52.391 --> 21:54.193
Are you a student's
of Professor Emerson’s?

21:55.474 --> 21:57.997
No. I study with someone else.

21:59.558 --> 22:02.161
He is considered good
by North American standards.

22:02.842 --> 22:06.245
However, his lecture
was an embarrassment.

22:09.849 --> 22:11.730
I see you’ve met my fidanzata.

22:14.253 --> 22:17.857
I suggest you keep
your hands to yourself,

22:17.937 --> 22:19.538
unless you’re prepared to lose them.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.437
We've been speaking for quite a while.

22:22.461 --> 22:23.462
She never mentioned you.

22:24.023 --> 22:29.108
Gabriel, this is Professor Pacciani.
He’s a Dante specialist.

22:31.911 --> 22:32.912
A thousand apologies.

22:32.992 --> 22:36.595
I should have realized
from the way you looked at her

22:36.675 --> 22:39.879
during your speech that...
she was yours.

22:42.081 --> 22:43.282
Forgive me, Simonetta.

22:44.763 --> 22:48.007
Darling, I need to find somewhere
to put my glass.

22:48.087 --> 22:50.609
I’m sure you know where to put this.

23:07.786 --> 23:08.908
Where are we going?

23:12.231 --> 23:14.593
I don’t want to see
another man’s hands on you again.

23:22.881 --> 23:24.883
What do I have to do
to make you mine?

23:24.964 --> 23:26.085
I am yours.

23:36.055 --> 23:37.056
No garters tonight?

23:40.499 --> 23:42.461
Am I to assume
you wore this for me?

23:44.103 --> 23:46.665
Only you... always.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.612
I want you panting my name.

24:20.819 --> 24:21.820
Don’t make a sound.

24:27.746 --> 24:29.028
You're driving me wild.

24:32.031 --> 24:33.032
Please don’t bite me.

24:51.130 --> 24:53.172
You deserve better
than a jealous lover

24:53.252 --> 24:54.693
taking you against a wall...

24:57.016 --> 24:58.017
Forgive me.

25:17.956 --> 25:21.680
I’m not about to undo the trust
I saw in your eyes last night.

25:22.881 --> 25:24.403
When I’m in my right mind and...

25:25.844 --> 25:27.686
we have the museum
all to ourselves...

25:31.730 --> 25:33.011
Another time.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.584
I could drink you like champagne.

25:48.067 --> 25:51.750
I wish you'd teach me
your tricks of seduction.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.435
Only if you will teach me
how to love as you love.

26:56.775 --> 26:57.776
Ciao bella.

26:58.857 --> 27:00.979
How are your studies
in Toronto coming along?

27:04.143 --> 27:07.426
Tonight I met Professor Emerson
and his fidanzata.

27:07.506 --> 27:11.109
His lecture was... pseudo-intellectual.

27:11.190 --> 27:14.873
Is this what passes for excellence
in North American universities?

27:16.355 --> 27:18.237
I miss your touch a great deal.

27:20.719 --> 27:24.643
Perhaps, we can rendezvous
later in the spring.

27:25.043 --> 27:27.125
Like I wanna have
sex with you again.

27:29.528 --> 27:31.330
Emmerson has a fiancée?

27:31.690 --> 27:33.011
The fuck!

27:35.254 --> 27:36.415
Buona sera.

27:36.495 --> 27:38.657
My studies have kept me very busy,

27:38.737 --> 27:40.499
but spring might work for me.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.704
Professor Emmerson is well regarded here,
but does lack charisma.

27:46.825 --> 27:48.947
He keeps his private life quite private.

27:51.310 --> 27:53.832
What is his fiancée's name?

28:26.545 --> 28:27.546
Are you okay?

29:11.109 --> 29:12.271
You wouldn’t speak.

29:14.673 --> 29:16.595
I was worried I was too rough.

29:17.516 --> 29:18.877
You didn’t hurt me.

29:20.879 --> 29:23.842
Every time you moved,
the most incredible feeling

29:23.922 --> 29:24.923
passed through me.

29:28.086 --> 29:30.289
Every time with you
is better than the last.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.694
You never say my name.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.497
I say your name all the time.

29:40.699 --> 29:44.663
It’s a wonder you haven’t come up
with a pet name you’d rather I use.

29:45.904 --> 29:46.945
Gabe...

29:49.067 --> 29:50.068
Dante...

29:50.909 --> 29:53.832
or... The Professor.

29:57.356 --> 29:59.478
You never say my name
when I make you come.

30:05.604 --> 30:09.448
To me, your name is
synonymous with orgasm.

30:11.570 --> 30:14.333
I’m gonna start calling them...
"emgasms".

30:47.886 --> 30:49.247
Definitely.

30:49.327 --> 30:51.370
My time, by the way...

30:58.577 --> 30:59.938
Try this one.

31:00.018 --> 31:01.179
- Nice?
- Mm-hm.

31:01.259 --> 31:02.260
Can I?

31:12.551 --> 31:13.552
Tastes good.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.234
You too.

31:45.664 --> 31:46.665
Oh, no.

32:24.623 --> 32:26.384
There is something
you could buy for me.

32:27.305 --> 32:28.306
Name it.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.477
I want my scar removed.

32:40.278 --> 32:41.800
I don’t like looking at it.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.203
I don’t like that you have to look at it.

32:45.443 --> 32:46.444
I want it gone.

32:46.845 --> 32:47.846
Gladly.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.332
I would like you to do
something for me.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.174
What?

32:58.817 --> 33:03.261
I would like you to talk to someone.
About what happened.

33:04.823 --> 33:06.144
I talk to you.

33:06.865 --> 33:09.027
I think It would help...

33:09.107 --> 33:11.590
if you had someone
to talk to about everything.

33:14.072 --> 33:20.078
About him, Tom, your mother... me.

33:20.759 --> 33:22.240
I'm a difficult man.

33:24.563 --> 33:26.284
It would help
if you had someone to talk to.

33:30.649 --> 33:32.170
I will...

33:33.411 --> 33:35.734
but only if you agree
to do the same thing.

33:37.335 --> 33:38.897
You were really angry last night

33:39.017 --> 33:41.379
and even though your anger
wasn't directed at me,

33:41.540 --> 33:43.501
I still had to bear the brunt of it.

33:44.382 --> 33:46.104
I tried to make up for it.

33:47.185 --> 33:48.707
It bothered me
that you were so upset

33:48.787 --> 33:51.229
over an unsolicited pass
from a stranger.

33:52.911 --> 33:56.955
You thought sex would relieve
your anger and mark me as yours.

33:57.876 --> 33:59.317
I would never hurt you.

33:59.397 --> 34:03.802
I know, and as much as sex
with you pleases me...

34:05.764 --> 34:09.127
I don’t wanna become
your new drug of choice.

34:09.206 --> 34:10.929
I can’t fix things.

34:15.813 --> 34:19.337
You think that I use
sex to... fix things?

34:21.458 --> 34:24.583
I think you used to use sex
to combat your loneliness

34:25.704 --> 34:27.264
or to punish yourself.

34:32.710 --> 34:35.553
We are quite a pair.

34:36.635 --> 34:39.317
With our scars and histories.

34:40.118 --> 34:42.721
A tragic romance, I suppose.

34:47.565 --> 34:49.447
The only tragedy
would be losing you.

34:50.809 --> 34:53.451
You’ll only lose me
if you stop loving me.

34:53.531 --> 34:57.535
I’m a lucky man then.
I’ll be able to keep you forever.

35:58.677 --> 36:00.518
What would you say
to a week in Umbria?

36:00.598 --> 36:02.560
Umbria? Really?

36:03.601 --> 36:06.965
I rented a villa.
We leave tomorrow.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.249
Bella signora.
Beautiful lad. Io ho fame.

36:11.329 --> 36:12.891
Grazie. Come, my love.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.573
Qualsiasi cosa
tu possa darmi, please!

36:15.653 --> 36:18.056
But he’s hungry.
And it’s so cold.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.417
The police will carry him off.

36:19.497 --> 36:21.698
They don’t like panhandlers
in the city center. Come on.

36:23.501 --> 36:26.344
People are free to come
and sit on the steps of a church.

36:26.424 --> 36:27.505
Sanctuary.

36:27.585 --> 36:31.469
The medieval concept of sanctuary
no longer exists.

36:33.351 --> 36:34.953
I know what it’s like to be hungry.

36:35.714 --> 36:37.796
He’ll spend the money
on drugs or wine.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.637
It isn’t going to help him.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.123
Even a drug addict deserves
a little kindness.

36:46.244 --> 36:49.647
St. Francis of Assisi didn’t make
his charity conditional.

36:49.728 --> 36:51.129
He gave to whomever asked.

36:51.249 --> 36:52.610
If I give him something,

36:52.690 --> 36:54.853
he’ll know someone
cared enough to help.

36:55.734 --> 36:58.977
Don’t deprive me
of an opportunity to give.

37:13.111 --> 37:15.473
- Buona forturna.
- Ringrazia a quell'angelo

37:15.553 --> 37:17.515
della tua ragazza
per aver avuto pietà di me.

37:24.763 --> 37:26.644
What did he say?

37:26.724 --> 37:28.686
He asked me to thank
the angel for her mercy.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.054
Thank you.

37:36.815 --> 37:38.736
I'm not the angel he was referring to.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.174
Grazie.

39:47.065 --> 39:49.547
When you said you rented a villa,

39:49.627 --> 39:51.910
I didn’t think it would be so opulent.

39:53.952 --> 39:58.596
There's also a fireplace...
and a hot tub.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.279
I didn’t bring a bathing suit.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.762
Who said anything
about bathing suits?

40:22.340 --> 40:23.421
So...

40:24.902 --> 40:25.903
What do you think?

40:28.506 --> 40:29.507
It’s perfect.

40:30.628 --> 40:35.313
I thought it would be good for us
to spend some quiet time together.

40:36.634 --> 40:40.478
Our time together
isn't usually quiet, Professor.

40:43.561 --> 40:47.005
That’s because you drive me mad.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.088
The hot tub is on the terrace.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.891
I’ll meet you there in 15 minutes.

40:54.612 --> 40:58.376
No clothes for the rest of the evening.

41:27.605 --> 41:28.606
Merry Christmas, Rabbit.

41:29.967 --> 41:31.385
I know it was a rough first semester

41:31.409 --> 41:34.492
and I’m sorry I didn’t do a better job
of helping you when you needed it.

41:35.053 --> 41:36.413
I’m proud of you for not quitting.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.658
With a big Vermont hug
from your friend, Paul.

43:02.140 --> 43:04.222
I want to please you.

43:07.064 --> 43:08.386
You do so much.

43:09.867 --> 43:11.509
With my mouth.

43:12.870 --> 43:16.194
I feel badly that I haven’t been
able to reciprocate.

43:18.276 --> 43:20.798
Julianne, there’s no
quid pro quo here.

43:24.642 --> 43:25.963
But since you’re offering...

43:41.139 --> 43:43.181
Is this position all right?

43:44.182 --> 43:45.183
It’s fine.

43:46.984 --> 43:48.226
Better than me on my knees.

43:48.426 --> 43:49.427
That’s right.

43:51.989 --> 43:57.315
I, on the other hand,
am happy to kneel before you,

43:57.395 --> 43:58.635
as I have already demonstrated.

44:20.698 --> 44:22.380
I have a strong gag reflex.

44:24.262 --> 44:25.983
It won’t be an issue. I promise.

44:37.034 --> 44:38.276
Please don’t hold my head down.

44:39.597 --> 44:40.758
I wasn’t going to.

44:45.363 --> 44:46.364
Are you all right?

44:48.606 --> 44:49.607
Sweetheart?

44:50.768 --> 44:52.410
I just don’t wanna throw up on you.

45:02.980 --> 45:07.305
Were you sick
because of a gag reflex

45:07.385 --> 45:11.829
or because that bastard
held you down?

45:14.832 --> 45:16.193
Fucking asshole.

45:56.434 --> 45:57.875
You think I’m dirty?

46:01.118 --> 46:02.119
Far from it.

46:04.241 --> 46:07.285
You’re the closest thing
to an angel I’ll ever touch.

46:09.527 --> 46:12.450
But I think we both need
to wash away the past.

49:29.687 --> 49:32.249
I’m sorry for being so emotional.

49:34.051 --> 49:36.253
You don’t have to hide
your feelings from me.

49:39.777 --> 49:42.660
I should have dumped Simon
the first time he was cruel.

49:44.902 --> 49:46.544
I didn’t stand up for myself.

49:51.869 --> 49:55.633
I know that what I told you
made you sick,

49:55.713 --> 49:57.154
but believe me, Gabriel,

49:57.234 --> 50:00.037
no one could be more disgusted
with myself than I am.

50:00.117 --> 50:01.919
I’m not disgusted with you.

50:03.921 --> 50:08.045
No one deserves to be treated that way.

50:15.693 --> 50:17.735
I still hear his voice in my head.

50:28.586 --> 50:30.507
Because we love each other,

50:32.189 --> 50:34.632
everything between us,

50:35.352 --> 50:38.956
including sex, is a gift.

50:40.157 --> 50:41.278
Not a right.

50:44.081 --> 50:45.563
You have me now.

50:46.724 --> 50:47.725
Let him go.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.409
I don’t want you to do
anything you don’t enjoy.

50:56.533 --> 50:58.856
You're safe when you're in my arms.

51:10.147 --> 51:12.790
I’ve never felt
more cared for in my life.

51:16.994 --> 51:18.676
You’re teaching me to love.

51:23.681 --> 51:26.203
And I suppose, I’m...

51:27.845 --> 51:29.767
teaching you to love in a way.

51:33.290 --> 51:34.491
We're not perfect,

51:36.253 --> 51:40.017
but we can have happiness.
Can’t we?

51:41.258 --> 51:42.419
Yes.

52:18.696 --> 52:23.140
You are an argument
for God’s existence.

52:23.661 --> 52:24.662
What?

52:29.947 --> 52:30.948
Your face...

52:33.871 --> 52:35.272
your breasts...

52:38.676 --> 52:40.277
your beautiful back.

52:44.601 --> 52:49.246
St. Thomas Aquinas would've had
to add you as his Sixth Way

52:50.167 --> 52:52.489
if he’d ever been blessed enough
to see you.

52:57.534 --> 52:59.616
You must have been designed...

53:01.298 --> 53:02.900
and not merely made.

54:36.353 --> 54:37.474
Gabriel!

54:51.408 --> 54:53.570
Will it always be like this?

54:56.653 --> 54:58.215
It will only improve with time.

55:08.625 --> 55:11.428
I’ll see the reflection
of all our shared joys

55:11.508 --> 55:13.190
and experiences in your eyes.

55:15.792 --> 55:20.037
Our history will make it better... deeper.

55:53.750 --> 55:56.353
I’m worried about
what will happen next year.

55:58.555 --> 55:59.556
Why?

56:01.598 --> 56:04.962
What if I don’t get
into the PhD program at Toronto?

56:08.645 --> 56:10.287
I didn’t know that you applied.

56:14.291 --> 56:15.732
I don’t wanna leave you.

56:17.814 --> 56:19.937
I don’t want you
to leave me either.

56:22.019 --> 56:24.101
The Toronto program isn’t for you.

56:24.701 --> 56:26.543
You’d have no one to work with.

56:27.704 --> 56:28.986
I can’t supervise you,

56:30.787 --> 56:33.510
and I doubt that Katherine would take
on a multi-year commitment.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.995
I thought you wanted
to go to Harvard.

56:40.757 --> 56:42.519
It’s so far away.

56:44.881 --> 56:46.964
We can see each other on weekends.

56:47.764 --> 56:49.606
I applied for a sabbatical.

56:50.247 --> 56:52.169
I could come with you
for the first year.

56:53.730 --> 56:56.333
I’ll be there at least six years.

56:56.453 --> 56:57.614
We’ll make it work.

56:59.176 --> 57:01.178
I’ll make sure we aren’t separated.

57:01.658 --> 57:02.819
I don't think you...

57:07.945 --> 57:10.707
I’ll fit my job around yours.

57:11.748 --> 57:13.270
That isn’t fair to you.

57:15.312 --> 57:17.714
I won’t let you sacrifice
your dreams for me.

57:21.838 --> 57:25.802
Now kiss me...
and tell me that you trust me.

57:53.070 --> 57:54.631
All settled in the BNB?

57:55.032 --> 57:57.834
Yes, thank you.
We're very comfortable.

57:59.236 --> 58:00.237
This came for you.

58:01.638 --> 58:02.679
FROM: PAUL NORRIS

58:05.682 --> 58:06.683
Thank you, Diane.

58:06.763 --> 58:07.964
You’re welcome, Tom.

58:11.888 --> 58:14.411
So... Gabriel treating you right?

58:15.812 --> 58:16.933
He loves me.

58:17.974 --> 58:19.736
He’s very good to me.

58:21.218 --> 58:22.419
You let me know if he isn’t.

58:26.343 --> 58:28.385
When Gabriel and I drove
into town this morning

58:28.505 --> 58:29.666
we went by the house.

58:30.587 --> 58:32.629
I put it up for sale
a couple of weeks ago.

58:33.390 --> 58:34.391
Why?

58:34.751 --> 58:37.112
I can’t live in a house
where my daughter doesn’t feel safe.

58:37.994 --> 58:41.838
You grew up in that house.
I thought you and Deb were plannning...

58:41.918 --> 58:43.160
It’s over with Deb.

58:45.082 --> 58:46.083
I'm sorry.

58:46.163 --> 58:47.764
We had a difference of opinion.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.127
And her kids don’t like me.

58:51.848 --> 58:54.131
Deb sided with Natalie and Simon?

58:55.732 --> 58:57.294
It's been a long time coming.

58:58.135 --> 59:00.217
It feels good to be a free agent...

59:01.778 --> 59:04.381
I wanna take
some of the money that I make

59:04.461 --> 59:05.741
and help pay for your education.

59:06.223 --> 59:08.225
You should use it
for your retirement.

59:08.305 --> 59:10.147
I’m sure there’ll be
enough for everything.

59:10.587 --> 59:12.429
From now on,
it’s just you and me, kid.

59:13.710 --> 59:15.192
All right, what can I get you two?

59:15.272 --> 59:16.553
Jelly donut?

59:17.674 --> 59:18.955
Two, please, Diane.

59:19.436 --> 59:21.438
And a lady grey tea.

59:21.558 --> 59:22.559
Alrighty.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.081
You got it.

59:25.122 --> 59:26.123
Men's room calling.

59:31.888 --> 59:33.250
Hello, Jules.

59:40.657 --> 59:41.914
Merry Christmas, Natalie.
What can I get for you?

59:41.938 --> 59:42.939
Merry Christmas, Diane.

59:43.019 --> 59:44.781
I’ll just have coffee.
I can’t stay long.

59:44.861 --> 59:45.862
Okay.

59:47.784 --> 59:49.146
I need to talk to you about Simon.

59:50.427 --> 59:52.189
You have nothing to say
that I wanna hear.

59:52.709 --> 59:54.111
Sit down or I’ll make a scene.

1:00:00.477 --> 1:00:02.279
Because of your misunderstanding
with Simon,

1:00:02.359 --> 1:00:04.241
he has a criminal record.

1:00:04.321 --> 1:00:07.003
That record needs to disappear
before it embarrasses the Senator.

1:00:07.924 --> 1:00:09.326
Fix it. Today.

1:00:11.288 --> 1:00:13.290
He’s already plea-bargained.

1:00:14.451 --> 1:00:16.253
Say it was a lover’s
quarrel gone awry

1:00:16.333 --> 1:00:18.655
and now you feel bad
having made the whole thing up.

1:00:19.296 --> 1:00:21.538
Look at you, for God’s sake.

1:00:21.658 --> 1:00:23.500
Simon could never be
interested in you.

1:00:27.063 --> 1:00:28.465
There isn’t a mark on you.

1:00:30.867 --> 1:00:32.709
I have pictures of you
that Simon took.

1:00:34.030 --> 1:00:36.112
They’re very... colorful.

1:00:38.675 --> 1:00:40.557
Do you care
if everyone in Selinsgrove

1:00:40.677 --> 1:00:42.077
sees these pictures
on the internet?

1:00:46.403 --> 1:00:47.764
You have the photos.

1:00:53.450 --> 1:00:54.731
I’m not going to do it.

1:00:56.373 --> 1:00:59.256
- Oh yes, you are.
- No, I’m not.

1:01:00.177 --> 1:01:02.497
Do you know that Senator Talbot
wants to run for President?

1:01:03.700 --> 1:01:05.422
I’m working for his campaign.

1:01:06.062 --> 1:01:08.425
If you release those photos,

1:01:08.505 --> 1:01:11.548
I’ll call Andrew Sampson
at the Washington Post.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:12.669
You remember him?

1:01:12.749 --> 1:01:15.071
He wrote that article
on Simon’s DUI arrest

1:01:15.151 --> 1:01:16.753
and how the Senator intervened.

1:01:17.474 --> 1:01:18.595
I don’t believe you.

1:01:20.036 --> 1:01:22.679
I’ll tell him that Simon
assaulted me,

1:01:22.759 --> 1:01:25.682
and then sent the girl he keeps
on the side to blackmail me.

1:01:26.843 --> 1:01:30.086
There’s no way you’re going to call up
a reporter and spill your guts.

1:01:30.166 --> 1:01:31.224
If you release those pictures,

1:01:31.248 --> 1:01:33.290
you’ll never work
for the Senator’s campaign again.

1:01:33.370 --> 1:01:35.452
You’ll just be part
of an embarrassing scandal

1:01:35.532 --> 1:01:36.893
that gets swept under the rug.

1:01:38.014 --> 1:01:41.778
I am never going to lie
about what he did to me.

1:01:41.858 --> 1:01:44.301
You’re just angry
that Simon chose me.

1:01:44.381 --> 1:01:47.344
You were this pathetic,
weak little girl

1:01:47.424 --> 1:01:49.426
who didn’t even know
how to give a decent blow job!

1:01:53.830 --> 1:01:55.111
Not so tough now, are you?

1:01:57.193 --> 1:01:58.194
Natalie, go home.

1:01:58.595 --> 1:01:59.916
Go home.

1:01:59.996 --> 1:02:02.117
You cannot sit in a restaurant
and talk like that. Go.

1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:04.961
This isn’t over.

1:02:05.041 --> 1:02:07.203
Yes, it is. Leave me alone.

1:02:13.450 --> 1:02:14.571
What’s wrong, Jules?

1:02:15.492 --> 1:02:18.335
Let’s just say
Natalie's been horrible to Julia.

1:02:20.857 --> 1:02:21.858
You okay?

1:02:22.819 --> 1:02:23.820
Goddamn it!

1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:24.901
Excuse me.

1:02:41.197 --> 1:02:42.279
I am so sorry.

1:02:45.562 --> 1:02:47.564
I should have slapped her
upside the head.

1:02:47.644 --> 1:02:49.966
Talking that kind of trash in my place.

1:03:17.033 --> 1:03:18.795
Donut and tea are on the house.

1:03:20.236 --> 1:03:21.558
Come on, come on...

1:03:39.656 --> 1:03:40.657
This is all my fault.

1:03:42.939 --> 1:03:47.824
Deb... Natalie... the house.

1:03:49.746 --> 1:03:51.908
I’ve embarrassed you
in front of the whole town.

1:03:51.988 --> 1:03:53.606
Hey, I don’t wanna hear
that kind of garbage.

1:03:53.630 --> 1:03:54.991
You’ve never embarrassed me.

1:03:56.513 --> 1:03:57.514
I’m proud of you.

1:04:00.997 --> 1:04:03.360
The best day of my life
was the day you were born.

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:42.919
I’m glad holiday shopping is over.

1:04:45.361 --> 1:04:46.643
FROM: PAUL NORRIS

1:04:49.245 --> 1:04:50.447
You've been crying.

1:04:50.527 --> 1:04:52.368
It’s just the Christmas blues.

1:04:54.290 --> 1:04:55.412
I’ll tell you later.

1:05:06.543 --> 1:05:08.465
Sweetheart, can I take your jacket?

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.122
Gabriel, darling.

1:05:27.564 --> 1:05:28.605
I’ve missed you!

1:05:31.728 --> 1:05:32.729
What are you doing here?

1:05:34.330 --> 1:05:37.494
Richard. As always a pleasure.

1:05:41.337 --> 1:05:43.500
I was so sorry to hear about Grace.

1:05:44.981 --> 1:05:46.743
Thank you, Paulina.

1:05:47.664 --> 1:05:50.547
Rachel. Aaron.
Help me in the kitchen.

1:05:57.273 --> 1:05:59.195
I didn’t know you had two sisters.

1:05:59.876 --> 1:06:01.437
I have only one sister
and you know it.

1:06:01.518 --> 1:06:03.359
Why are you here?

1:06:03.439 --> 1:06:06.282
I’m Julia. We spoke on the phone.

1:06:07.844 --> 1:06:09.502
You can’t expect me
keep track of all the girls

1:06:09.526 --> 1:06:11.047
who’ve answered Gabriel’s phone.

1:06:11.728 --> 1:06:13.488
Unless you were
one of the girls I spoke with

1:06:13.530 --> 1:06:14.891
when I interrupted a ménage?

1:06:16.573 --> 1:06:17.950
Do you remember that night, Gabriel?

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:19.736
Why are you here, Paulina?

1:06:19.816 --> 1:06:22.979
I came to see you.
You wouldn’t return my calls.

1:06:23.059 --> 1:06:24.661
Are you on your way to Minnesota?

1:06:25.782 --> 1:06:27.984
You know my parents
don’t speak to me.

1:06:30.106 --> 1:06:33.910
I need to talk to you... alone.

1:06:34.030 --> 1:06:35.752
Let me remind you
that you are a guest.

1:06:35.832 --> 1:06:38.995
I won’t tolerate
your disrespect for anyone,

1:06:39.075 --> 1:06:40.396
especially Julianne.

1:06:42.559 --> 1:06:43.800
Do you understand?

1:06:46.482 --> 1:06:49.606
You never treated me like a guest
when you were in my mouth.

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.943
Julie, are you all right?

1:07:07.063 --> 1:07:10.266
No. I need to lie down.

1:07:10.346 --> 1:07:12.308
Who is that woman?
Why is she here?

1:07:13.710 --> 1:07:15.191
You'll have to ask your brother.

1:07:57.513 --> 1:07:58.715
Where have you been?

1:08:00.637 --> 1:08:01.638
Out.

1:08:03.239 --> 1:08:04.240
Where’s Julia?

1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:07.003
Upstairs. Or maybe she went
to her dad's place.

1:08:08.765 --> 1:08:09.926
Why would she do that?

1:08:10.687 --> 1:08:12.809
Because you went out
with your ex-girlfriend

1:08:12.889 --> 1:08:14.490
and left her for three hours...

1:08:14.570 --> 1:08:15.612
I hope she dumps your ass.

1:08:15.692 --> 1:08:17.133
I’d like to speak with Gabriel.

1:08:28.344 --> 1:08:31.027
It’s clear that Paulina needs help.

1:08:32.228 --> 1:08:34.590
You should tell Paulina
that she can have access

1:08:34.671 --> 1:08:37.834
to the trust fund
that you’ve set up for her

1:08:37.914 --> 1:08:40.036
if she seeks professional help.

1:08:40.156 --> 1:08:41.997
Make that a necessary condition.

1:08:42.879 --> 1:08:43.880
All right.

1:08:45.241 --> 1:08:46.242
I will.

1:08:47.523 --> 1:08:48.925
And what of Julia?

1:08:52.689 --> 1:08:53.690
Julianne is my...

1:08:56.893 --> 1:08:57.974
She's my future.

1:08:59.736 --> 1:09:00.777
She’s a student.

1:09:02.337 --> 1:09:03.578
Are you being responsible?

1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:08.785
Julia is like Grace,

1:09:08.865 --> 1:09:12.028
and her willingness to sacrifice herself
for those she loves.

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:15.071
I won’t let her to sacrifice her
dreams for me.

1:09:17.914 --> 1:09:19.755
If you abandon Julia,

1:09:19.835 --> 1:09:23.599
you’ll have a serious problem
with your siblings as well as with me.

1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:26.962
I would never abandon her.

1:09:28.484 --> 1:09:29.845
And I won’t live without her.

1:09:31.367 --> 1:09:32.608
Then you should marry her.

1:09:35.050 --> 1:09:38.453
We’ve only been together
for a couple of weeks.

1:09:38.533 --> 1:09:42.098
Your actions indicate that she's...

1:09:42.218 --> 1:09:45.421
just a partner in a sexual affair,

1:09:45.501 --> 1:09:47.503
but your intentions are serious.

1:09:47.583 --> 1:09:49.225
I’m committed to her.

1:09:50.827 --> 1:09:52.028
There’s no one else.

1:09:52.388 --> 1:09:55.431
And yet, Paulina appears,

1:09:55.511 --> 1:09:57.633
looking for you,

1:09:57.714 --> 1:10:01.397
makes a spectacle
in front of Julia and your family.

1:10:05.762 --> 1:10:06.763
I can’t help that.

1:10:08.204 --> 1:10:09.205
Can’t you?

1:10:11.607 --> 1:10:16.773
I find it difficult to believe that
somebody's as intelligent as Paulina

1:10:16.853 --> 1:10:22.657
would arrive without some hope
that overtures would be accepted.

1:10:55.932 --> 1:10:56.933
Gabriel?

1:10:58.254 --> 1:10:59.615
What time is it?

1:11:01.818 --> 1:11:02.898
Six thirty.

1:11:06.022 --> 1:11:08.023
Why didn’t anyone wake me?

1:11:11.666 --> 1:11:13.269
They were waiting for me.

1:11:16.472 --> 1:11:18.514
Where did you go for so long?

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.041
Were you with her?

1:11:30.807 --> 1:11:33.689
Her drivers license is suspended
because of a DUI.

1:11:34.650 --> 1:11:37.934
I dropped her off at a hotel.

1:11:38.014 --> 1:11:39.375
And we were talking.

1:11:41.017 --> 1:11:44.380
Talking? At a hotel?

1:11:44.460 --> 1:11:47.824
She’s upset about the turn
her life has taken.

1:11:52.028 --> 1:11:54.831
Her appearance was
a desperate attempt to change direction.

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:04.520
She’s gone,
and she won’t be coming back.

1:12:05.401 --> 1:12:06.642
I promise.

1:12:09.045 --> 1:12:11.968
I told her again
that I’ve fallen in love with you.

1:12:12.808 --> 1:12:15.491
She has my money and my lawyers.

1:12:16.052 --> 1:12:17.053
That’s it.

1:12:17.773 --> 1:12:19.775
That’s never been enough for her.

1:12:20.416 --> 1:12:21.457
She wants you.

1:12:21.537 --> 1:12:23.459
She doesn’t care that you’re with me.

1:12:23.539 --> 1:12:25.261
I don’t care what she wants.

1:12:26.621 --> 1:12:28.264
You are my future, Julianne.

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:34.070
She’s beautiful... and sexy.

1:12:34.590 --> 1:12:36.832
She’s malicious and petty.

1:12:38.034 --> 1:12:40.276
You made a child together.

1:12:40.396 --> 1:12:41.998
Not by choice.

1:12:51.487 --> 1:12:53.409
I hate having to share you.

1:12:54.290 --> 1:12:56.252
You will never have
to share me, Julianne.

1:12:56.371 --> 1:12:58.734
I have to share you with your past.

1:13:00.056 --> 1:13:03.379
With Paulina,
with Professor Singer,

1:13:03.459 --> 1:13:04.620
with countless other women

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:07.103
I’m probably gonna pass
on the street in Toronto.

1:13:07.183 --> 1:13:09.025
I’ll do my best to protect you

1:13:09.105 --> 1:13:11.387
from embarrassing encounters
in the future.

1:13:13.869 --> 1:13:15.231
It still hurts.

1:13:32.848 --> 1:13:33.889
If you were thirsty

1:13:36.012 --> 1:13:39.495
and someone offered you
water from the ocean,

1:13:41.737 --> 1:13:42.737
would you drink it?

1:13:42.818 --> 1:13:44.020
Of course not.

1:13:46.662 --> 1:13:49.865
And if someone gave you
the choice between that water

1:13:52.148 --> 1:13:53.709
and a glass of Perrier,

1:13:56.032 --> 1:13:57.233
which would you choose?

1:13:57.513 --> 1:13:59.875
The Perrier. I don’t see
what this has to do with her.

1:14:00.476 --> 1:14:01.477
Don’t you?

1:14:02.838 --> 1:14:05.561
Don't you see the comparison
between you two?

1:14:07.123 --> 1:14:09.165
You are my water.

1:14:11.687 --> 1:14:13.809
You’re all I need to quench my thirst.

1:14:15.531 --> 1:14:19.535
Why would I throw this away
for water from the ocean?

1:15:05.061 --> 1:15:06.142
Merry Christmas.

1:15:06.862 --> 1:15:08.384
Merry Christmas.

1:15:21.797 --> 1:15:23.879
I’ve never had a stocking before.

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:06.562
What’s this?

1:16:08.924 --> 1:16:13.809
A certain tango against the wall
of the Royal Ontario Museum.

1:16:30.986 --> 1:16:32.228
Do you like them?

1:16:33.109 --> 1:16:34.110
I love them.

1:17:12.188 --> 1:17:13.189
MERRY CHRISTMAS

1:17:14.068 --> 1:17:15.710
It’s time you had photographs of us

1:17:15.791 --> 1:17:18.032
to hang on the walls of your bedroom.

1:17:18.954 --> 1:17:20.916
I’d like to do this for you.

1:17:25.241 --> 1:17:27.323
You are the greatest gift.

1:17:42.498 --> 1:17:45.541
To my Adored Julianne

1:17:49.865 --> 1:17:51.427
GIFT CERTIFICATE

1:17:51.507 --> 1:17:53.549
Seaweed and salt body wrap?

1:18:01.237 --> 1:18:04.320
I’ve made arrangements for you
to see a plastic surgeon in Toronto.

1:18:05.841 --> 1:18:08.884
He’s confident your scar
can be removed completely.

1:18:12.368 --> 1:18:13.449
Thank you.

1:18:20.896 --> 1:18:22.175
What was in your gift from Paul?

1:18:23.459 --> 1:18:26.101
A bottle of maple syrup
that I gave to dad,

1:18:26.181 --> 1:18:27.343
and a couple of toys.

1:18:28.264 --> 1:18:29.264
Toys?

1:18:29.344 --> 1:18:31.186
Didn’t he give you a toy bunny?

1:18:31.907 --> 1:18:33.869
He has some kind of rabbit fetish.

1:18:33.949 --> 1:18:36.712
You have a fetish for women’s shoes.

1:18:36.791 --> 1:18:38.914
Professor Pot meet Mr. Kettle.

1:18:39.193 --> 1:18:42.638
I’ve never denied
my aesthetic appreciation

1:18:42.758 --> 1:18:43.879
for women’s footwear.

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:46.242
They’re works of art,

1:18:47.443 --> 1:18:50.326
especially when a woman
as lovely as you is wearing them.

1:18:51.407 --> 1:18:52.808
He gave me a stuffed cow

1:18:52.888 --> 1:18:55.451
and a pair of Dante
and Beatrice figurines.

1:18:55.531 --> 1:18:58.614
Are they anatomically correct
action figures?

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:00.055
You’re incorrigible...

1:19:00.135 --> 1:19:01.937
Just wondering what kind of action

1:19:02.017 --> 1:19:05.621
they were capable of participating in,
privately, of course.

1:19:06.822 --> 1:19:08.744
Thank you for my presents.

1:19:09.985 --> 1:19:12.107
Thank you for taking me to Italy.

1:19:12.907 --> 1:19:14.029
You’re welcome.

1:19:32.407 --> 1:19:34.089
Richard wants us to go to church.

1:19:34.889 --> 1:19:35.891
Good.

1:19:37.532 --> 1:19:40.296
Wouldn't a nice Catholic girl
like you prefer to go to Mass?

1:19:40.896 --> 1:19:42.498
It’s the same God.

1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:46.181
Don’t you wanna go?

1:19:50.386 --> 1:19:51.666
They’ll... judge me.

1:19:53.108 --> 1:19:55.591
We’re all sinners.

1:19:55.671 --> 1:19:58.914
If only non-sinners went to church,
the churches would be empty.

1:20:04.199 --> 1:20:06.201
But why do you still believe in God?

1:20:08.043 --> 1:20:09.044
Aren’t you angry with him

1:20:09.124 --> 1:20:10.846
for all of the things
that happened to you?

1:20:13.088 --> 1:20:16.091
Bad things happen to everyone.

1:20:16.171 --> 1:20:18.053
Why should my life be any different?

1:20:18.894 --> 1:20:19.895
Because you’re good.

1:20:21.737 --> 1:20:23.898
Everyone suffers sometimes.

1:20:24.580 --> 1:20:27.862
The question is what you do
with that suffering, right?

1:20:33.349 --> 1:20:35.751
Did you ever readThe Brothers Karamazov?

1:20:37.112 --> 1:20:38.634
It’s one of my favorites.

1:20:40.476 --> 1:20:42.638
Ivan rejects God’s world, yet...

1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:48.484
there’s one aspect that he finds
surprisingly beautiful.

1:20:49.284 --> 1:20:53.088
The sticky little leaves he sees
on the trees in spring.

1:20:54.249 --> 1:20:58.053
He loves them even though
he hates the world around them.

1:20:59.695 --> 1:21:05.180
The sticky little leaves
aren’t faith or salvation.

1:21:06.382 --> 1:21:08.424
They’re the remnant of hope.

1:21:09.585 --> 1:21:11.707
Despite the evil he’s seen,

1:21:11.787 --> 1:21:15.911
there’s still one good
and beautiful thing left.

1:21:22.678 --> 1:21:25.000
What are your sticky little leaves?

1:21:29.324 --> 1:21:30.486
I don’t know.

1:21:33.529 --> 1:21:35.050
I’ve never thought about it before.

1:21:37.332 --> 1:21:39.655
Mine was Grace...

1:21:42.337 --> 1:21:43.378
and you.

1:21:51.226 --> 1:21:53.549
But what about the suffering
of the innocent?

1:21:57.753 --> 1:21:59.114
What about the babies?

1:22:02.197 --> 1:22:04.440
I don’t know why babies die.

1:22:05.761 --> 1:22:07.202
I wish they didn’t...

1:22:09.004 --> 1:22:11.166
What’s wrong with the rest of us?

1:22:12.448 --> 1:22:15.250
Everyone wants to know
where evil comes from.

1:22:16.011 --> 1:22:18.934
Why doesn’t anyone ask
where goodness comes from?

1:22:19.334 --> 1:22:23.218
Why are people like
Grace and Richard so kind?

1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:27.983
There are sticky little leaves,
if you look for them.

1:22:29.505 --> 1:22:31.066
And when you recognize them...

1:22:33.308 --> 1:22:36.031
you can feel God’s presence.

1:23:06.541 --> 1:23:07.702
It's fine, it's fine...

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.282
- This one is for you...
- Thank you.

1:23:11.306 --> 1:23:13.348
I heard you met someone.

1:23:13.428 --> 1:23:14.790
Her name’s Tammy.

1:23:15.751 --> 1:23:18.353
I’m not ready for everyone
to give her the third degree yet.

1:23:19.193 --> 1:23:20.195
I understand.

1:23:21.236 --> 1:23:22.758
This came for you this morning.

1:23:22.838 --> 1:23:25.080
- Oh... who’s it from?
- Don't know.

1:23:26.522 --> 1:23:28.323
This one is for you.

1:23:28.403 --> 1:23:29.404
Don't look at that...

1:23:37.412 --> 1:23:38.413
It's very delicate.

1:23:43.378 --> 1:23:45.821
- This one?
- Yeah.

1:23:46.621 --> 1:23:47.623
Gabriel?

1:23:48.624 --> 1:23:49.625
Gabriel!

1:24:03.518 --> 1:24:04.519
Gabriel!

1:24:07.242 --> 1:24:08.884
Gabriel! Wait!

1:24:08.964 --> 1:24:10.165
Slow down!

1:24:10.245 --> 1:24:11.647
Get back to the house!

1:24:11.727 --> 1:24:13.128
I’m not leaving you.

1:24:13.889 --> 1:24:15.971
Paulina’s never going to let me go.

1:24:16.932 --> 1:24:19.494
She needs to start a new life.

1:24:19.575 --> 1:24:21.255
She needs your help.

1:24:21.897 --> 1:24:23.258
You want me to help her?

1:24:23.338 --> 1:24:26.101
After she got on her knees
and tried to take my pants down?

1:24:26.942 --> 1:24:27.943
What?

1:24:31.466 --> 1:24:33.709
It was a desperate attempt
by a desperate woman.

1:24:35.751 --> 1:24:37.272
Did you say no?

1:24:37.952 --> 1:24:39.514
Of course!

1:24:40.916 --> 1:24:41.916
What do you take me for?

1:24:43.118 --> 1:24:44.279
Were you surprised?

1:24:48.243 --> 1:24:49.244
No.

1:24:51.286 --> 1:24:53.448
Why weren’t you surprised?

1:24:53.528 --> 1:24:55.490
'Cause this is what she does.

1:24:55.570 --> 1:24:57.012
Does or did?

1:24:57.132 --> 1:24:58.133
What’s the difference?

1:24:58.734 --> 1:25:00.175
If I have to explain that to you

1:25:00.255 --> 1:25:02.097
then we are more damaged
than I thought.

1:25:09.103 --> 1:25:11.146
She’d show up on occasion and...

1:25:14.389 --> 1:25:15.710
And we'd...

1:25:17.592 --> 1:25:20.395
When I asked if Paulina
was your mistress, you said no.

1:25:20.475 --> 1:25:21.677
She was never my mistress.

1:25:21.757 --> 1:25:22.814
Don’t play word games with me!

1:25:22.838 --> 1:25:24.239
Especially about your fuck buddies.

1:25:24.318 --> 1:25:25.478
That’s beneath you, Julianne.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:28.563
It’s beneath me to tell the truth,

1:25:28.644 --> 1:25:30.165
but you can lie through your teeth!

1:25:30.245 --> 1:25:32.166
I never lied to you about Paulina.

1:25:32.246 --> 1:25:33.248
Yes, you did.

1:25:34.969 --> 1:25:36.451
Was she in your bed?

1:25:37.612 --> 1:25:40.175
The bed we slept in together?

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:46.581
I’m sorry.

1:25:46.662 --> 1:25:48.704
When was the last time
you slept with her?

1:25:49.705 --> 1:25:52.307
Don’t... touch me!

1:25:59.394 --> 1:26:00.675
When we met,

1:26:01.636 --> 1:26:03.518
things with Paulina had ended.

1:26:04.359 --> 1:26:06.441
I hadn’t been with her
since last December

1:26:06.521 --> 1:26:09.324
when I told her that we needed
to stop once and for all.

1:26:10.165 --> 1:26:13.608
You led me to believe
you ended things with her at Harvard.

1:26:14.730 --> 1:26:17.773
Do you have any idea
how much this hurts?

1:26:18.814 --> 1:26:21.416
She traipses into your parents’ house
like she belongs there,

1:26:21.496 --> 1:26:23.058
like I’m the fuck buddy.

1:26:23.178 --> 1:26:25.660
No wonder! You’ve been sleeping
with her for years.

1:26:25.741 --> 1:26:27.382
I was trying to protect you.

1:26:28.583 --> 1:26:31.546
Tread very carefully, Gabriel.

1:26:31.626 --> 1:26:34.669
We only saw each other
once or twice a year.

1:26:36.712 --> 1:26:39.072
Did you expect me to catalogue
every sexual encounter I had?

1:26:41.076 --> 1:26:43.478
That night when I told you about Maia,

1:26:43.558 --> 1:26:45.559
you told me I could find forgiveness

1:26:45.639 --> 1:26:47.362
and I wanted to believe you.

1:26:49.885 --> 1:26:52.928
I thought if I told you how I gave
in to Paulina again and again,

1:26:53.008 --> 1:26:54.009
I'd...

1:26:55.410 --> 1:26:57.332
I’d lose you...

1:26:57.412 --> 1:26:58.413
Do you love her?

1:26:59.693 --> 1:27:00.936
Of course not.

1:27:03.138 --> 1:27:05.781
So, you slept with her for years

1:27:06.341 --> 1:27:08.702
after you made a child with her

1:27:08.784 --> 1:27:12.307
and she had a nervous breakdown,
but you didn’t love her?

1:27:13.148 --> 1:27:14.870
She was Maia’s mother.

1:27:16.031 --> 1:27:17.873
And look how you treated her.

1:27:19.474 --> 1:27:21.156
You used her.

1:27:22.397 --> 1:27:24.719
You fed her with scraps like a dog.

1:27:26.121 --> 1:27:28.163
Would you ever treat me like that?

1:27:28.282 --> 1:27:29.443
Never...

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:32.246
Never.

1:27:34.249 --> 1:27:35.370
Can you forgive me?

1:27:37.692 --> 1:27:40.375
Have you ever asked Paulina
to forgive you?

1:27:42.416 --> 1:27:43.698
You toyed with her heart.

1:27:45.540 --> 1:27:47.422
I know what that feels like.

1:27:48.904 --> 1:27:51.266
I can have compassion for her.

1:27:52.868 --> 1:27:54.509
I felt something for her.

1:27:57.552 --> 1:27:58.553
Guilt...

1:28:01.837 --> 1:28:02.838
lust...

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:07.442
some affection, but never love.

1:28:11.166 --> 1:28:13.288
You’re the only woman
I've ever loved.

1:28:16.731 --> 1:28:19.174
I’d rather spend my life
drinking your love

1:28:19.294 --> 1:28:21.416
than emptying
all the oceans of the world.

1:28:23.618 --> 1:28:26.421
Your promises are meaningless

1:28:26.501 --> 1:28:29.103
when they aren’t accompanied
by honesty.

1:28:30.344 --> 1:28:31.666
It won’t happen again.

1:28:34.148 --> 1:28:36.591
You’ll tire of me eventually.

1:28:38.112 --> 1:28:40.514
I wandered in the darkness

1:28:40.594 --> 1:28:43.198
looking for something better,
something real.

1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:46.201
And I found you.

1:28:49.204 --> 1:28:51.206
I’ll be damned
if I’m going to lose you.

1:28:57.973 --> 1:29:01.216
I’m not so wounded
that I can’t say no to you.

1:29:02.777 --> 1:29:06.141
If you lie to me again,
it will be the last time.

1:29:07.182 --> 1:29:08.463
I promise.

1:29:13.188 --> 1:29:15.230
What was the gift
that she gave you?

1:29:20.996 --> 1:29:22.557
An ultrasound picture.

1:29:27.762 --> 1:29:29.724
That picture can’t hurt you.

1:29:31.806 --> 1:29:34.129
Maia deserves to be remembered.

1:29:35.530 --> 1:29:38.813
Paulina meant for the picture
to hurt you, but it’s a gift.

1:29:39.975 --> 1:29:43.498
You should have it.
You’re her father.

1:29:54.829 --> 1:29:57.152
I won’t sleep in the bed
you shared with her.

1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:07.642
I’ll have everything redone
before we get back to Toronto.

1:30:11.446 --> 1:30:14.009
Let me show you
that I can be worthy of your trust.

1:30:14.930 --> 1:30:16.251
Please.

1:30:37.272 --> 1:30:39.114
We should meet
in Madrid in February.

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:44.839
We can then discuss
Professore Emerson’s fidanzata.

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:50.085
Ms. Mitchell...
you're looking smart as always.

1:30:51.446 --> 1:30:52.447
Ms. Peterson.

1:31:03.098 --> 1:31:04.379
He's with one of his students.

1:31:04.499 --> 1:31:05.660
Paulina is irrelevant

1:31:05.740 --> 1:31:08.463
and has no real bearing
onto this discussion, Ms. Peterson.

1:31:09.103 --> 1:31:11.266
She was either his mistress
or his fuck buddy.

1:31:11.987 --> 1:31:12.987
Class is dismissed!

1:31:14.949 --> 1:31:16.791
In my office, Ms. Mitchell. Now!

1:31:22.397 --> 1:31:24.719
You've gotta rewrite the entire thesis.

1:31:33.688 --> 1:31:35.370
Ethan said you were looking for me?

1:31:36.251 --> 1:31:37.692
Lucas, right?

1:31:39.214 --> 1:31:42.097
I hear that you have access
to the security cameras.

1:31:43.218 --> 1:31:44.219
Yeah.

1:31:45.180 --> 1:31:47.782
I need to see the footage
starting in September.
