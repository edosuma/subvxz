00:20.560 --> 00:23.950
Europe at the close
of the 18th century.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.910
The nobility rules by oppression,
supported by strong religious forces.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.548
But the winds of change
are blowing ...

00:31.720 --> 00:34.712
Across the continent
intellectuals and freethinkers -

00:34.880 --> 00:36.632
demand reforms and freedom
for the people.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.669
It is the age of the Enlightenment.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.672
<i>I'm trying to remember him.</i>

00:55.720 --> 00:57.711
<i>Johann.</i>

01:00.600 --> 01:04.194
<i>I have to tell you about him.</i>
<i>About us.</i>

01:05.480 --> 01:08.870
<i>Why we did the things we did.</i>

01:18.240 --> 01:23.439
A Royal Affair

01:30.760 --> 01:33.558
<i>My beloved children,</i>
<i>you do not know me.</i>

01:33.720 --> 01:36.837
<i>But I am your mother.</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:39.514
<i>Perhaps you have</i>
<i>never forgiven me.</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:43.468
<i>Perhaps you hate me.</i>
<i>I hope not.</i>

01:45.040 --> 01:48.635
<i>I now know</i>
<i>that I will never see you again.</i>

01:48.800 --> 01:53.954
<i>I am writing to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>before it is too late.</i>

01:59.240 --> 02:05.634
ENGLAND 1766
Nine years earlier

02:07.200 --> 02:11.398
<i>I was officially wed to your father,</i>
<i>King Christian VII -</i>

02:11.560 --> 02:14.313
<i>- before even meeting him.</i>

02:14.480 --> 02:19.156
<i>Even though I had never left England,</i>
<i>I was now the Queen of Denmark.</i>

02:19.320 --> 02:22.710
<i>A new life</i>
<i>and an entirely new language.</i>

02:22.880 --> 02:24.871
'Good afternoon'.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.232
'Shall we go for a stroll in the
park?'

02:31.520 --> 02:36.878
<i>I had prepared and longed for this</i>
<i>day ever since I was a little girl.</i>

02:41.360 --> 02:43.237
<i>To be Queen of an exotic country -</i>

02:43.400 --> 02:47.598
<i>- and honour and love</i>
<i>my husband unconditionally.</i>

02:49.920 --> 02:54.596
<i>Christian was said to be charming,</i>
<i>interested in art and literature -</i>

02:54.760 --> 03:00.039
<i>- and even fond of acting. I could</i>
<i>not imagine a more perfect husband.</i>

03:39.000 --> 03:43.232
Denmark

04:28.960 --> 04:33.317
Your Majesty. Louise von Plessen,
your lady-in-waiting.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.756
This is Reventlow,
his Majesty's private tutor.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.753
Welcome, Your Majesty.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.912
Would you like
to meet the King?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.671
Your Majesty.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.748
Gourmand!
There you are, old boy!

07:34.920 --> 07:36.797
There you are!

07:36.960 --> 07:39.474
Did you miss, daddy?

07:39.640 --> 07:42.313
Did you miss, daddy?

08:00.640 --> 08:03.632
Your Royal Highness,
please concentrate.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.793
Why?
I will never have any use for it.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.993
When will I see Christian again?
- His Majesty will attend the banquet.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.879
Do you know where my books are?

08:34.039 --> 08:37.953
The court is reviewing them. Some
will be shipped back to England.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.109
Why?

08:42.280 --> 08:45.875
Many of your books
are under Danish censorship.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.631
I apologize.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.950
I didn't know.
- That's quite alright.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.033
We will find something else
for you to read.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.749
Minister Bernstorff.
He's the most powerful man here.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.797
Minister Warberg.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.556
Stay away from him, if you can.
He has a very distinct odour.

09:28.480 --> 09:33.031
That must be the King's stepmother.
- Queen Dowager Juliane Marie.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.397
And the Majesty's half-brother,
the heir presumptive.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.870
Neither she nor her son
are popular with the people.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.474
Why not?

09:42.640 --> 09:46.838
His Majesty doesn't regard them
as part of the family.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.120
The Danish people have always had
a sixth sense about these things.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.196
You were so far away.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.514
You have a flair for drama,
my dear Queen.

10:18.680 --> 10:22.912
Will you come to my chambers
after tonight's program?

10:36.480 --> 10:42.919
"Come, let's away to prison. We two
alone will sing like birds in a cage."

11:18.760 --> 11:23.231
She's enchanting.
And so talented.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.391
Yes.
Thank you.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.279
The nobility is captivated by her.

11:28.440 --> 11:32.672
They seem to think she's needed.
- Really? Why?

11:32.840 --> 11:38.312
Many of them are saying
she is just what Denmark needs.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.029
A true artistic soul
on the throne.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.431
Thank you,
that is quite enough!

12:10.480 --> 12:12.198
What?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.157
What?

12:14.320 --> 12:17.630
That insufferable noise
is giving me a headache!

12:20.680 --> 12:22.432
Come on.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.718
Move your fat little thighs
and have a seat.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.871
Go on!

12:53.000 --> 12:57.039
The King is here to visit the Queen
as per agreement.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.873
It'll be fine.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.473
Yes ...

13:47.920 --> 13:49.717
Yes ...

13:55.960 --> 13:57.757
Yes.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.190
I'm sorry.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.199
Don't steal my light.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.799
What do you mean?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.992
Take off your clothes and lie down.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.832
"Oh, how I have
sweated and slaved ...

15:24.960 --> 15:29.158
... and yet nothing accomplished."

15:29.320 --> 15:33.791
<i>I wish I'd had the strength</i>
<i>to forgive Christian's behavior.</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:37.509
"Someone to spare Man
the fear of God.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.912
Such a ..."

15:41.080 --> 15:44.629
<i>But I was too young to understand</i>
<i>how sick and tormented he was.</i>

15:46.360 --> 15:48.271
<i>All I could think about was -</i>

15:48.440 --> 15:52.638
<i>- that I had to spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with him.</i>

15:55.880 --> 15:58.872
<i>I began hating him for it.</i>

16:06.080 --> 16:09.914
<i>In the eyes of the Court,</i>
<i>I was soon blessed.</i>

16:10.080 --> 16:12.992
<i>You were on your way, Frederik.</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:17.436
His Majesty wishes to visit
the Queen's chambers.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.831
I'm sorry, we've just begun
another game of chess.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.231
This has been going on for weeks.
What is she thinking?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.039
<i>Having fulfilled</i>
<i>my main obligation as queen -</i>

16:27.200 --> 16:30.192
<i>- I saw no reason</i>
<i>to maintain the facade.</i>

16:32.160 --> 16:34.993
<i>I would pay dearly for that.</i>

16:39.120 --> 16:40.997
Christian, stop!

16:41.160 --> 16:44.596
I never want to see
your ugly face again!

16:44.760 --> 16:47.638
You're fired, cow!

17:08.520 --> 17:10.714
There, there.
Relax.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.759
A true queen delivers
in silence and with dignity.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.718
He has stomach pains.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.433
I'm going on a tour of Europe.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.353
I'll be gone for at least a year.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.229
Do you think it matters to me
whether you're here or not?

17:49.720 --> 17:54.350
<i>This was my life.</i>
<i>My fate.</i>

17:54.520 --> 17:57.876
<i>I had resigned myself to it.</i>

17:58.080 --> 18:02.312
<i>Or rather ... it could</i>
<i>have been my life.</i>

18:03.840 --> 18:07.594
Altona, a Danish colony in Germany

18:07.760 --> 18:10.991
Do you know
where I can find the hospital?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.918
Thanks a lot.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.592
Excuse me,
is Doctor Struensee here?

18:27.960 --> 18:30.793
Johann Struensee?
- Who's asking?

18:30.960 --> 18:36.557
Count Rantzau requests
that you attend to him immediately.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.679
Count Rantzau? Are you sure
you have the right Struensee?

18:40.840 --> 18:45.709
I am not to return without you.
- A count is calling. Better get going.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.959
What do you think? Should I abandon
my bleeding patient for some count?

18:51.120 --> 18:54.954
Maybe he will pay you.
That would be nice for a change.

18:56.440 --> 19:01.639
What the hell is wrong with it?
- Could you hold it for a second?

19:09.360 --> 19:12.397
You're a bit of a mystery, Struensee.

19:12.560 --> 19:17.270
Your father is one of Germany's
most conservative priests -

19:17.440 --> 19:24.391
and yet you insist on publishing
praises to the French freethinkers.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.758
If you hadn't written them
anonymously, you'd be in prison.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.116
Well written.
Quite Voltaire-inspired.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.955
Don't worry.
You're among friends.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.470
You've been using it too much.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.672
But I'm sure your many lady friends
are quite content.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.717
Yeah, right.
- I like him.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.438
Am I done?

19:55.600 --> 19:58.398
Struensee, how would you like
a new position?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.110
What position is that?

20:02.280 --> 20:05.397
The King's personal physician.

20:06.840 --> 20:11.231
Believe it or not, Brandt and I
were at the very top of the Court.

20:11.400 --> 20:17.270
High enough to be sniffing the chaste
minister wives between the legs.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.877
When King Frederik died, Bernstorff
removed the ones he didn't like.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.793
So here we are
in the world's asshole.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.192
Sorry about that.
- We miss life at Court.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.757
The King is in Hamburg right now
on his grand tour of Europe.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.356
But they're stuck.
He's too ill to continue.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.390
What's wrong with him?

20:49.040 --> 20:53.318
The Court is now searching
for a personal physician -

20:53.480 --> 20:57.598
to take care of the King
on the rest of his journey.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.829
We could get your name
onto the list of candidates.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.116
You'd definitely need a new suit.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.511
They would never let me
near the King.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.036
Why not?
- I'm a small-town doctor.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.875
And you had no trouble uncovering
that I'm a man of the Enlightenment.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.918
So are we!
- I am. Rantzau just thinks he is.

21:24.080 --> 21:28.596
Just don't talk about it at Court. Keep
mentioning your father, the priest.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.877
The Court loves that crap.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.192
And in the unlikely event
that I get the job? What then?

21:38.360 --> 21:42.831
You use your position to get Brandt
and me back into the inner circle.

21:49.440 --> 21:54.468
What does a personal physician do?
Blow the King's nose or ...?

21:54.640 --> 21:58.269
Lick his feet, wipe his ass.
Who cares? It's the King!

22:53.400 --> 22:55.755
No!
No!

22:55.920 --> 22:58.354
I don't want to!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.795
Johann Struensee?

23:14.800 --> 23:19.032
You may have heard that the King
has certain ... moods.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.794
Only rumours.
Do you have a theory?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.235
He's been difficult since childhood.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.838
But I think most of his problems
stem from excessive masturbation.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.673
You may enter.

23:46.680 --> 23:50.389
Your Majesty, my name is ...
- I don't need a doctor!

23:54.080 --> 23:57.197
The Court thinks you need a doctor.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.595
Do you have any idea why?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.595
I like to drink.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.788
I like hookers with big breasts,
and I like fighting.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.996
What's wrong with that?

24:16.680 --> 24:19.638
I am King!

24:34.120 --> 24:37.157
What if you weren't King.
What would make you happy?

24:42.160 --> 24:45.675
"To sleep, perchance to dream."

24:50.480 --> 24:55.110
"Often expectation fails and most
often there, where most it promises."

25:00.640 --> 25:04.394
"All the world's a stage, and all
the men and women merely players."

25:07.960 --> 25:11.953
"They have their exits
and their entrances -

25:12.120 --> 25:15.237
and one man in his time
plays many parts."

25:18.040 --> 25:21.919
"What a piece of work is a man."

25:22.080 --> 25:27.200
"There's something rotten in the ..."
- I don't like that one. Pick another.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.271
Come!

25:31.320 --> 25:33.151
A horse ...

25:33.320 --> 25:36.232
"My kingdom for a horse."

25:36.400 --> 25:40.154
"The web of our life is of
a mingled yarn, good and ill together."

25:45.440 --> 25:50.116
COPENHAGEN, 1769

25:51.440 --> 25:54.318
Your Majesty,
there's a slight confusion about -

25:54.480 --> 25:56.994
when and where
the French tenor will sing.

25:57.200 --> 26:02.877
In the dining hall, following dessert.
But wait until the tables are cleared.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.032
Is everyone by the main stairs?
- Shortly, Your Majesty.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.919
Then we'll call upon You
and the ministers.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.833
That was all, Your Majesty.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.514
Lord Chamberlain ...

26:15.760 --> 26:21.517
Did you remember Gourmand?
- The dog. Thank you, Your Majesty.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.356
Your Majesty.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.589
Where is the people?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.113
Is there no one to cheer
the return of the King?

27:06.280 --> 27:09.750
We thought Your Majesty
would be tired from the long journey.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.832
I want to be greeted by my people.
Get them.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.628
Get the people here now!
Otherwise I'll jump in the canal.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.909
Do you hear me?
I'll jump in the canal!

27:23.080 --> 27:27.232
A splendid idea, Your Majesty. A nice
swim in the canal would do You good.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.595
Aha.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.594
You really think so?
- Absolutely.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.877
Shall we?

27:37.040 --> 27:39.998
A little later, perhaps.
Come.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.556
Can you believe that His Majesty
has terminated Reventlow.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.190
The tutor who's been with him
since he was a child.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.079
I think the new physician
is a bad influence.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.438
He is said to be an amoral libertine,
who drags His Majesty to whore ...

28:00.120 --> 28:03.556
Are you not spending the evening
with the King?

28:03.720 --> 28:07.110
He is giving Doctor Struensee
a tour of the castle.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.630
Struensee! You follow politics, right?
- It happens.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.998
You must join me in the council today,
or I shall be terribly bored.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.114
It is a rather harmless satire,
Mr. Guldberg.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.989
To call satire that mocks the nobility
'harmless' is unfortunate.

28:35.160 --> 28:39.472
What is next. The Court?
The King? The Church?

28:39.640 --> 28:42.438
I am not inclined to put anyone
in prison for a poem about -

28:42.600 --> 28:45.319
the size of a nobleman's derriÃ¨re.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.871
A fine and a year's ban
on publishing will suffice.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.035
He has spent his apanage
for the entire year in only 4 months.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.509
He will not leave us alone
till we respond.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.468
As the letter shows, she was quite
pleased and asked us to give -

29:08.640 --> 29:11.234
the Russian delegate
a token of our appreciation.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.552
... extensive acreage
which is a forest area ...

29:15.720 --> 29:18.393
If we don't, the people may ...

29:18.560 --> 29:23.315
... cannot allow primitive pirates
to humiliate our fleet.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.710
... 15 per tonnage.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.555
What is it?
- Just sign it, Your Majesty.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.632
... agricultural reform is ...

29:32.800 --> 29:35.997
... strikers to be thrown in ...

29:36.160 --> 29:39.789
... and our naval officers.
We have reached a decision.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.357
They all think I'm crazy.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.873
Hi!

29:58.600 --> 30:02.229
What the hell is going on,
why haven't we heard from you?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.914
It's good to see you too, Rantzau.
Brandt.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.152
So, now we use first names?
What the hell are we doing here?

30:08.320 --> 30:12.154
Aren't we good enough for Court?
- Come on in.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.554
Rantzau! Brandt!

30:25.880 --> 30:30.590
Your Majesty.
- I missed you. Welcome home.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.034
Why does Copenhagen reek of shit?

30:50.200 --> 30:53.749
Shit, shit, shit ... I have the smell
of shit in my nose, shit on my shoes.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.629
I am the King of Shitty Town.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.679
Your Majesty,
have a drink with us.

31:01.840 --> 31:06.152
Do you find it appropriate to visit
whorehouses and drink every night?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.675
For everyone to see.

31:09.680 --> 31:14.276
Your Majesty, the people don't mind.
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.032
Christian?

31:18.840 --> 31:21.149
I apologize, Mother.

31:32.120 --> 31:36.352
Why did I have to end up
with that boring cow?

31:36.520 --> 31:41.469
The world is full of princesses,
and I got stuck with the grumpy one.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.393
When she's not playing Queen,
she's in her room sleeping.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.279
Perhaps she's ill?

31:49.000 --> 31:53.232
Of course! She must be ill.
No one can be that boring.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.871
Attend to her, Struensee.
- I don't think the Queen likes me.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.510
But one of your Court doctors ...
- No, no. It has to be you.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.478
Make her fun.
I want a fun queen.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.954
I'll send her to your chambers.

32:17.040 --> 32:21.511
I find nothing wrong, Your Majesty.
- I could have told you that.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.831
It is your spirits.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.515
Pardon?
- Your mood.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.832
You're in a bad mood.
Do you get enough fresh air?

32:34.400 --> 32:40.111
And hobbies?
I hear you're an accomplished pianist.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.512
You heard wrong.
Are we done?

32:44.680 --> 32:48.116
I will recommend to the Court that
we move to the summer residence.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.471
With your approval, of course.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.592
Rousseau.

33:12.760 --> 33:17.436
"Man is born free,
and everywhere he is in shackles."

33:25.040 --> 33:27.554
May I borrow this?

33:39.400 --> 33:43.154
Holstein, Germany

33:56.520 --> 33:59.318
The loser
gets thrown in the water!

34:00.680 --> 34:02.272
No!

34:04.120 --> 34:07.749
Yes! King Christian the 7th,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

34:26.679 --> 34:30.070
I hear there's a smallpox epidemic
coming in Copenhagen.

34:30.239 --> 34:34.119
What do you say, Struensee?
- Let's hope it's a small one.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.909
You've charmed our entire nobility,
Struensee.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.231
Perhaps we should acquire more?

35:01.840 --> 35:05.355
You have an interesting
book collection.

35:05.520 --> 35:10.230
One day you have to tell me
how you got it into the castle.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.594
Do You ride, Your Majesty?

35:19.960 --> 35:22.394
Not if I can help it.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.394
It feels so ... clumsy.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.836
That is because
You use side-saddle.

36:45.320 --> 36:49.632
As Your new physician, I'd hate
for You to get ill, Your Highness.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.117
It reminds me of England.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.400
Locke and Voltaire are excellent.

37:40.560 --> 37:45.918
But some of the Enlightenment's ideas
are a bit extreme, don't you think?

37:46.080 --> 37:50.596
Rousseau's notion of abandoning
civilization and living in trees.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.958
He knows it's not actually possible.
- But still.

37:55.120 --> 37:59.989
I agree that some of society's norms
prevent people from living their lives.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.752
How so?

38:01.920 --> 38:07.199
Religion. Marriage. Anything that
takes away from personal freedom.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.113
Don't have children, Struensee.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.190
I hadn't planned to.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.155
So what <i>do</i> you want?

38:19.120 --> 38:21.998
I want to travel the world,
Your Majesty -

38:22.160 --> 38:25.391
and see places
you only read about.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.958
That sounds like a good life.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.799
What is that?
- A wooden horse.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.311
Don't be afraid.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.232
Don't ...

38:58.080 --> 39:01.038
Is he dead?
- Yes.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.757
He was punished by his master.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.116
Why was this done to him?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.518
Why?

39:25.120 --> 39:29.079
I don't know. Perhaps he stole
something or was in the wrong place.

39:29.240 --> 39:33.153
But someone thought
he should be tortured to death for it.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.479
There's nothing we can do.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.871
The Court owns estates
in this area.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.079
These peasants probably
belong to someone we know.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.313
Brandt, have you seen Struensee?

40:11.480 --> 40:16.315
Yes, he returned to Copenhagen.
Something about a smallpox epidemic.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.998
Copenhagen, 1769
I don't know what to do.
We don't have enough room.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.196
How many dead?
- Almost 20 today.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.596
Who's he?
I've seen him before.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.718
He's a servant at the castle, Doctor.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.075
You're out of your mind, Struensee.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.708
Experimenting on the people
is one thing -

41:04.880 --> 41:08.589
but to risk the Crown Prince's life?

41:08.760 --> 41:15.233
I am trying to safeguard his life.
- What is he even doing out there?

41:15.400 --> 41:18.995
His Majesty's personal physician has
no business roaming city hospitals.

41:19.160 --> 41:24.518
More than 700 people have died.
Most of them children.

41:24.680 --> 41:29.196
Today the epidemic crossed the
canals and reached Christiansborg.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.193
Have you previously tested
this inoculation?

41:32.360 --> 41:36.069
Yes. On myself as well.
- What is the survival rate.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.359
There's always some risk ...
- 'Some risk'!

41:41.520 --> 41:45.877
But if it goes well, and I'm confident
that it will, he will be immune.

41:46.040 --> 41:50.397
The Crown Prince is the heir
to the throne! He's protected by God!

41:50.560 --> 41:55.031
A smallpox epidemic is not picky.
It kills both kings and queens.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.634
As you very well know.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.555
Your Majesty?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.639
Mother, can we please leave?

42:43.760 --> 42:47.992
Now we wait.
- Dear Struensee, come sit with us.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.910
The inoculation was a success.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.275
Thank you, God.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.352
God has nothing to do with this.

43:36.920 --> 43:39.275
How many lives
could your method save?

43:39.440 --> 43:42.512
Most of them.
If it's done right.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.833
Then what are we waiting for?

43:48.360 --> 43:51.989
Are you mocking me?
- No. But I'm not the one to ask.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.630
Her Highness proposes
that the Court administers -

43:57.800 --> 44:02.476
an extensive smallpox inoculation
at the city's hospitals.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.950
We looked into it,
but the expense ...

44:06.120 --> 44:09.317
Say no more,
we have enough expenses as it is.

44:09.480 --> 44:14.952
Inform Her Majesty that her proposal
will be considered at a later date.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.430
What's this?
- Your Majesty?

44:56.480 --> 44:57.959
"Anonymous."

45:06.360 --> 45:08.954
"J.S."

46:25.920 --> 46:27.911
Rantzau.
- Your Majesty.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.311
Allow me to introduce
Madame Sophie Livernet.

46:31.480 --> 46:36.076
Your Majesty, an honour.
- The light of my life.

46:38.760 --> 46:42.036
Have you noticed how well
he behaves when he's with her?

46:42.200 --> 46:47.991
She's only after his money.
Her family lost their entire fortune.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.549
As long as he's happy.

46:50.720 --> 46:55.589
Yes, men ignore reason when it comes
to beautiful young women.

46:57.160 --> 47:00.835
'Le Morte d'Arthur'.
Have you read it? Thomas Malory.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.150
I've heard of it.

47:03.320 --> 47:07.438
King Arthur's knight, Sir Lancelot,
has an affair with Queen Guinevere.

47:07.600 --> 47:11.991
The king finds out, orders them both
killed, and the kingdom falls apart.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.549
You're a fool.

47:21.040 --> 47:26.797
I like you a lot. I don't want
to mourn by your severed head.

47:50.440 --> 47:53.876
Your Majesty.
- Don't get up.

47:57.640 --> 48:00.950
I managed to slip away
from the ministers' wives.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.714
Years of practice.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.514
Do you think we'll ever be free?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.591
The people, I mean.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.596
Mankind.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.398
Will your treasured Enlightenment -

48:29.560 --> 48:33.712
free us from stupidity
and fear of divine punishment?

48:36.920 --> 48:40.230
I think so.
Yes.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.315
Frederik's generation will be
the standard bearer for a new dawn.

48:52.200 --> 48:55.078
So we should lie
on our deathbeds and rejoice -

48:55.240 --> 48:58.710
as the new dawn
passes us by?

49:06.560 --> 49:10.439
You will never see your brilliant ideas
carried out.

49:14.240 --> 49:18.233
At Court I have
the authority of a mere maid.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.475
And my husband?

49:23.640 --> 49:26.712
He has the authority.

49:29.240 --> 49:34.234
I don't think you realize how much
influence you have on Christian.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.111
He trusts you unconditionally.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.155
What will you dress up as
for the ball?

49:50.320 --> 49:55.553
I'm going as a French courtjester.
I shall talk like this.

49:55.720 --> 49:59.599
Like a Frenchman.
All night.

50:04.080 --> 50:08.437
Do you remember telling me that
everyone at Court thinks you're crazy?

50:11.880 --> 50:15.714
That's funny.
- I don't think you are.

50:17.320 --> 50:22.553
I think some people are so sealed
inside their fate that they hide -

50:22.720 --> 50:25.598
deep within their mind.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.790
You could be an amazing king,
Christian.

50:36.920 --> 50:41.311
You could make a difference,
if you used your power in the Council.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.278
I don't know about all that stuff.
I can't.

50:44.440 --> 50:47.352
Of course, you can.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.715
How?

50:49.880 --> 50:52.440
By doing what you love the most.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.875
Acting.

50:59.160 --> 51:03.631
Just like in the theatre. With lines
that have already been written.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.634
Acting?

51:15.200 --> 51:18.078
If it were up to you,
what would you change?

51:22.320 --> 51:27.030
Honoured members
of the Council.

51:32.600 --> 51:37.879
No longer shall refined noble noses
be tainted with the city's stench.

51:38.040 --> 51:42.670
No longer shall the people suffocate
in the reek of its own waste.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.558
Your Majesty ...
- I ...

51:44.720 --> 51:49.748
... King Christian VII,
hereby declare war on shit.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.118
I want to triple the number
of waste collectors on the streets.

51:54.280 --> 51:59.752
Where will the money come from?
- I knew you would ask me that.

51:59.920 --> 52:04.152
The money will be acquired
by cutting down on pensions -

52:04.320 --> 52:09.189
for those who still have income
from their estates and therefore -

52:09.360 --> 52:11.590
do not need a pension.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.595
Fine, Your Majesty.
More waste collectors.

52:23.400 --> 52:27.871
And Gourmand will be appointed
honorary member of the Council.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.757
Struensee!

53:06.880 --> 53:09.110
Your Majesty.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.389
You recognized me.
- I would recognize you blindfolded.

53:16.960 --> 53:20.191
But your costume
is not very imaginative.

53:20.360 --> 53:24.592
I'm afraid I am not very good
at masquerades.

53:26.560 --> 53:30.439
I believe this is the one night
when everyone can be themselves.

53:32.560 --> 53:37.031
But you never remove your mask.
Do you?

53:43.440 --> 53:44.953
Your Majesty.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.515
Will you do me the honour?

54:22.080 --> 54:23.638
Thank you!
