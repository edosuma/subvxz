WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.240
[whispering loudly]
I'm hungry.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.079
Mooovie Monday!

00:11.112 --> 00:15.616
The only cure I know
for the Monday blues is...

00:15.649 --> 00:18.319
Varsity Blues.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.720
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:19.753 --> 00:21.589
Take a seat down there.
Second from the end.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.524
All right,
everybody here?

00:23.557 --> 00:24.525
Yes.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.127
Popcorn, anyone?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.661
Yes, please!

00:27.695 --> 00:29.263
Thank you.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.333
Anyone else?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.435
No.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.670
Movie Monday started
with training videos.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.639
But we went through those
pretty fast.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.410
Then we watched
a medical video.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.112
Since then, it's been
half hour installments

00:44.145 --> 00:46.514
of various movies.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.849
With the exception of
an episode of Entourage,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.651
which Michael made us watch
six times.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.288
Entourage!

01:26.287 --> 01:29.290
Kevin, would you like to do
the scenes from last week?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.558
Yes.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.692
Why him?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.194
Don't whine.
Get the windows.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.364
Previously on
Varsity Blues...

01:36.397 --> 01:39.300
(Kevin)
Okay, Billy Bob
got a head injury,

01:39.333 --> 01:40.868
but coach made him play.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.737
So then Lance,
he gets sacked.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.306
And he's out for the year.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.581
Hello?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.617
Not everyone approves
of movie Monday.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.252
I won't say who.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.888
I don't approve.
I don't.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.624
Hello?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.359
[clearing throat]

02:08.696 --> 02:10.664
Let's go after
that title now.

02:10.698 --> 02:14.134
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go!

02:16.937 --> 02:18.206
Hi, Jan!

02:18.239 --> 02:19.540
Hope you brought
the Milk Duds.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.242
How would a movie

02:21.275 --> 02:22.743
increase productivity,
Michael?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.679
How, on earth,
would it do that?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.515
People work faster after.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.549
Magically.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.251
No.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.786
They have to,
to make up for the time...

02:32.820 --> 02:33.787
watching the movie.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.389
No.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.191
Do I need to hire
a babysitter for you...

02:37.225 --> 02:38.492
Kitchen.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.593
(Jan)
Some little 14-year-old girl

02:39.627 --> 02:41.329
whose job it is...

02:41.362 --> 02:43.231
Michael is going to
get us all fired.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.932
You sat back and let him
play that dumb movie

02:44.965 --> 02:46.334
and now Jan is peeved off.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.801
And we're all
going to lose our jobs.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.537
That's not going to happen.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.672
You know she has it
out for him now.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.940
That's not his fault.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.442
He had to
follow his heart.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.744
Ever since Michael
dumped Jan for Carol,

02:56.777 --> 02:58.712
Jan's been bitching out
on him.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.615
Reject a woman and she will
never let it go.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.784
One of the many defects
of their kind.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.286
Also, weak arms.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.889
Dwight, you should be
running this office.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
Michael would never let me.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.696
It's not
up to Michael.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.964
It's Jan's call.
Talk to her.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.432
I could never do that.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.600
Fine, sit back
and do nothing

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
and let us all
get fired.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.942
I know that patience
and loyalty are good

03:28.976 --> 03:30.644
and virtuous traits.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.847
But sometimes I just think
you need to grow a pair.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.717
(Jim)
At the Stanford branch,
they all play

03:36.750 --> 03:39.687
this World War II video game
called Call of Duty.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.290
And they're all
really into it.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.992
I'm told it started
as a team building exercise.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.027
Unfortunately,
I really suck at it.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.662
Oh.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.565
We didn't play
many video games in Scranton.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.834
Instead
we'd do stuff like...

03:53.867 --> 03:56.570
Uh, Pam and I would sometimes
hum the same

03:56.604 --> 03:57.871
high pitched note.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.707
And try to get Dwight
to make an appointment

03:59.740 --> 04:02.343
with an ear doctor.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.679
And Pam called it...

04:05.713 --> 04:07.481
Pretendonitis.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.783
Hey, Kelly,
my stuff just got here.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.719
[Kelly screaming]

04:11.752 --> 04:14.555
Kelly really likes
to online shop.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.459
So I felt like I wanted
some new clothes.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.628
I mean, I just...

04:20.661 --> 04:22.630
I wanted to...

04:22.663 --> 04:26.900
I felt like it was time
to maybe, um...

04:26.934 --> 04:28.536
just get new clothes.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.739
Okay.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.541
I love it.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.042
Really?
I don't know.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.610
Now, you haven't even
tried it on yet.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.845
Try it on.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.079
Not at work.
I'll try it on--

04:39.112 --> 04:40.781
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

04:40.814 --> 04:42.350
Fashion show at lunch!

04:44.084 --> 04:45.419
No.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.654
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

04:46.687 --> 04:48.722
Fashion show at lunch!

04:48.756 --> 04:49.990
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

04:50.023 --> 04:51.525
Fashion show at lunch!

04:53.594 --> 04:55.796
[slams fist into desk]
Why did you do that?

04:55.829 --> 04:58.332
I'm just killing Germans
any way I can.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.668
We're on the German team.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.638
Shoot the British.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.073
Wait, are we
playing teams?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.342
[laughing]
Yeah.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.611
Wah!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.980
Gah!

05:13.013 --> 05:17.017
[breathing heavily]

05:17.050 --> 05:20.988
[phone ringing]

05:22.055 --> 05:23.591
(Jan)
Hello?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.092
(Dwight)
Is this Jan?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.093
Who is this?

05:26.126 --> 05:29.430
This is Dwight Schrute.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.699
I am calling about
an extremely sensitive matter.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.701
You should talk to Michael
and he'll talk to me

05:33.734 --> 05:35.969
and that way we don't have
to speak to each other.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.638
It's about Michael.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.073
What about him?

05:40.107 --> 05:43.377
I can't talk here.
It's too sensitive.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.646
It's not about
a surprise party, is it?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.715
No, but we should discuss that
another time.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.451
Look, I'm already an hour
outside of Scranton, Dwight.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.919
I am not coming back.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
Pull over at exit 40.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.891
There is
a Liz Claiborne outlet.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.727
I know you
like that store.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.963
Go inside and shop
until I can meet you.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.965
How do you know
I like that store?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.734
Many of your blouses
are Claibornes.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.402
How do you know that?

06:08.436 --> 06:10.003
It's part of my job.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.806
No, it's not.
It's officially not.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.975
Noted.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.777
* Mm mm mm

06:16.810 --> 06:18.612
I'm going to the dentist.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.415
Okay.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.150
I have to have
an emergency crown put in.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.652
Ouchy.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.887
Yes.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.057
It's a new dentist.
He's far.

06:30.090 --> 06:34.027
I might be gone
three hours.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.162
Three hours, wow.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.797
Have fun.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.737
Did you get anything good?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.473
Yeah.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.775
New blouse?

06:47.808 --> 06:52.212
Halter top?
Camisole?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.547
Teddy?

06:53.581 --> 06:54.682
I could save the branch.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.716
Really.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.218
If you let me run it.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.553
Okay.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.721
Okay, I can run it?

07:00.754 --> 07:04.191
What would you do differently?

07:04.224 --> 07:05.659
Mostly get rid of waste.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.228
Which is half
the people there.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.464
And clean house.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.833
Right here.
It's all for me.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.967
Thank you.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.670
Dwight, you just feel strongly
to speak with me this way

07:16.704 --> 07:18.105
behind Michael's back.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.140
And turn on so many
of your co-workers.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.077
The decision to turn on Michael
was difficult.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.714
But once I did it,
I didn't look back.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.216
And mostly I feel that
Michael would approve.

07:29.249 --> 07:34.254
It's really what's best
for the branch.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.790
And I could care less
about my co-workers.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.227
So, here we are.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.897
It's all on the table.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.834
I want the branch.

07:46.867 --> 07:51.639
And I await your decision.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.177
Oh, by the way...

07:57.210 --> 08:00.047
There's a new Ann Taylor
outlet store near here.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.482
I know you like
their earrings.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.754
Where is it?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.088
(Jan)
Michael.
Hi.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.890
I've had a very interesting
conversation

08:09.923 --> 08:11.024
with one of
your employees.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.125
Oh, that's nice.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.627
No, it wasn't.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.962
Dwight just told me
that he thinks

08:14.995 --> 08:16.997
he can run the branch
better than you.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.266
What?
Mm-hmm.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.701
You were at the dentist?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.002
You can't have people
undermining you.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.170
Get control of your branch
immediately.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.137
Okay.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.305
What was Dwight thinking?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.708
That he could turn Jan
against me?

08:27.741 --> 08:30.210
She's my ex-lover...ishh.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.015
Wow.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.149
It's so sexy.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.184
You look so hot.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.052
It's really something.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.187
It's too much.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.789
What?
I'm gonna return it.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.290
No, you have to keep it today.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.793
Just see how you feel.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.060
Hey.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.128
Hi.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.997
You look nice.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.933
Thanks.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.101
Isn't that, like,
your third soda today?

08:56.604 --> 09:00.173
Yeah, I think we can be
a big help to your company.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.044
Okay, see you next week.
Bye.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.113
Again?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.214
Scared?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.849
Call of Duty!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.351
[gunfire]

09:11.384 --> 09:13.721
Andy, Jim, can I see you
in the conference room

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
for a minute?
Now?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256
Yes, now.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.257
Put the game on hold,
everyone.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.792
This is not working, okay?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.227
We are getting slaughtered
out there.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.362
It's the new guy.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.797
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't know...

09:23.831 --> 09:24.798
what we're talking about.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.966
See what I mean?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.134
We just need a strategy, okay?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.269
We're gonna set up a trap
in the gun room.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.104
All right, Jim,
are you using the MP-40

09:31.138 --> 09:32.640
or the 44?

09:32.673 --> 09:33.707
Um, sniper rifle?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.075
Snipe--
What?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.910
Are you playing for
the other team?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.846
You don't snipe
in Carrington, okay?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.714
Saboteur!

09:40.748 --> 09:41.849
Saboteur!

09:41.882 --> 09:44.852
I'm gonna kill you for real.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.119
The game is over.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.155
I'm really
going to shoot you.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.702
Hey, Dwight...
Hey.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.970
You want an m&m?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.205
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.
No, seriously.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.975
You should have an m&m.
They're really good.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.279
Okay.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.788
Good, huh?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.257
So good.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.231
Hey, I thought you weren't
supposed to eat anything

10:31.264 --> 10:33.200
for a couple of hours
after you've had

10:33.233 --> 10:34.968
a crown put in.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.775
They have this new kind of
quick drying bonding.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.876
So...

10:42.910 --> 10:43.977
Sounds like a good dentist.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.245
Oh, yeah.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.081
What's his name?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.655
Crentist.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.760
Your dentist's name
is Crentist.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.931
Huh.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.699
Sounds a lot like dentist.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.170
Maybe that's why
he became a dentist.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.708
Let me see your teeth.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.310
Let me see 'em.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.347
Let me see 'em.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.953
Ohh.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.092
You should floss.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.729
I know.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.431
Well then.

11:42.369 --> 11:47.107
I'm glad you're okay.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.009
Business is like
a jungle.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.379
And I am like a tiger.

11:52.412 --> 11:56.283
And Dwight is like
a monkey...

11:56.316 --> 12:00.153
that stabs a tiger
in the back with a stick.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.123
Does the tiger
fire the monkey?

12:03.156 --> 12:06.126
Does the tiger
transfer the monkey

12:06.159 --> 12:09.062
to another branch?

12:09.096 --> 12:12.232
Pun.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.235
There is no way
of knowing what goes on

12:15.268 --> 12:18.038
inside the tiger's head.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.040
We don't have
the technology.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.445
Dwight, can I talk to you
for a second?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.219
[exhales]

12:32.252 --> 12:34.922
Wow, this is tough!

12:34.955 --> 12:36.223
Brrrrr!

12:36.256 --> 12:37.858
What?

12:37.891 --> 12:41.028
Oh.
[inhales]

12:41.061 --> 12:42.562
Aaaarg!

12:42.595 --> 12:43.964
What is it?

12:43.997 --> 12:47.901
Well...

12:47.935 --> 12:50.037
I just got off the phone
with Jan.

12:50.070 --> 12:53.073
And, um...

12:56.143 --> 12:57.510
She demoted me.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.913
No.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.081
Yeah.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.916
You know what the craziest
part of this is?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.451
She demoted me
to your job.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.586
[suppressed guttural noise]

13:06.619 --> 13:08.856
And she said that you
should be expecting

13:08.889 --> 13:09.990
a call later from corporate.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.092
And that, um...

13:12.125 --> 13:15.062
I guess that means
that you are going to be

13:15.095 --> 13:16.930
acting manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.999
I can't believe this news.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.935
That...wow.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.471
Yeah.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.940
I told her I didn't know
whether you'd wanna do it.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.242
Because you've always been
so loyal to me.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.379
You've been my most
trusted ally.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.615
You said that?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.385
Yep, I did.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.988
I did.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.458
But I think...

13:45.492 --> 13:48.195
you should do it.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.932
Well...

13:51.965 --> 13:54.434
Gosh, if you think
I should.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.003
Then I will.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.575
Perfect.
Well, we're settled.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.644
All right.
All right.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.947
Well, then you are now
acting manager

14:06.980 --> 14:09.249
of Dunder-Mifflin
Scranton branch.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.185
And I am assistant
regional manager.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.386
Assistant to
the regional manager.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.322
Thank you, Michael,
for staying on.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.356
I really appreciate it.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.959
Hey, hey.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.361
I can't imagine this place
without you.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.531
Can you?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.500
That's so nice.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.305
Well, um...

14:32.339 --> 14:34.007
I guess we should
go tell the troops.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.978
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.612
Okay, let's do it.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.219
Hey. Hi, hello.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.521
Everybody, I have
some good news.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.357
And I have
some bad news.

14:50.390 --> 14:55.262
I am being replaced
as your leader by Dwight.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.964
You're kidding.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.431
You might think
that I am kidding

14:58.465 --> 15:00.267
and I understand that.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.368
Congratulations, Dwight.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.403
Thank you, Angela.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.972
But why Dwight?

15:05.005 --> 15:09.542
Because Dwight never lies.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.144
How does that qualify him
to run a branch?

15:11.178 --> 15:12.645
Because that's all it takes.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.015
Okay, Dwight,
would you like to

15:15.048 --> 15:18.285
say a few words
to everybody about loyalty?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.153
Thank you, Michael.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.355
I just wanna say
to the few of you

15:22.389 --> 15:23.690
who will remain
under my employ,

15:23.723 --> 15:27.094
that I intend to lead you
into the black

15:27.127 --> 15:29.029
with ferocity.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.730
Michael, what will you do?

15:30.763 --> 15:31.965
Oh, I'll be fine.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.433
Do you have any savings?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.968
No, no, I don't.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.303
Michael, you might
lose your condo.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.370
I won't.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.205
I won't.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.540
I have this
little vacuum cleaner

15:40.573 --> 15:41.674
that's broken.

15:41.708 --> 15:42.675
If Dwight doesn't
work out,

15:42.709 --> 15:44.311
maybe that could be manager.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.046
Maybe I'll quit.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.614
It's really happening.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.618
Yes.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.321
We can
make a difference here.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.525
I will make
a difference here.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.093
You alone?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.361
'Cause I thought together...

16:01.394 --> 16:03.096
Oh, please,
don't be naive.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.368
You can be in charge
of the women.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.375
[gunfire]

16:15.408 --> 16:18.011
Look how cute he is.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.213
And he's trying to shoot
with a smoke grenade.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.182
I'm sorry, what are you
whispering back there?

16:22.215 --> 16:24.217
Nothing, just concentrate
on turning around.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.318
I'm trying.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.453
I just...

16:26.486 --> 16:27.587
Just tap S then D.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.222
Oh.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.724
Any last words? No?
What?

16:31.758 --> 16:34.261
[gunshot]

16:34.294 --> 16:35.395
[laughing]

16:35.428 --> 16:36.729
Wow.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.001
Psychopath.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.408
What?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.543
I'm just looking.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.113
Please go back
to your desk.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.148
In a minute.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.653
Well, I remember why I dress
the way I do at work.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.655
But I'm gonna
keep the clothes.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.756
I mean, it'll just be cool

17:03.790 --> 17:07.427
to have some after work clothes
other than pajamas.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.070
Well, I guess it's time...

17:17.104 --> 17:19.572
that I turn over the keys

17:19.606 --> 17:21.408
to the famous Sebring.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.143
No, thank you.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.377
It's a corporate lease,
Dwight.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.478
You've earned it.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.147
No, thanks.
What?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.282
Not my style.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.619
But you said
you liked it.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.687
You've always admired it.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.688
That was before.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.290
I'm thinking about
getting something German.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.391
Something with
decent gas mileage.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.193
Plus the convertible

17:40.227 --> 17:43.630
is a ridiculous choice
for this climate.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.198
Take it back.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.600
No.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.106
That's my car.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.677
What did you--
That's my car!

17:57.710 --> 17:59.579
Yes.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.614
I know, Dwight.
I know.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.483
I know. I know.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.717
You know what?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.886
Jan called me
about your little meeting!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.588
No.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.458
I know what you did.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.526
I made the whole thing up,
Dwight.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.861
The Sebring's cool.
Oh, do you?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.163
Do you like the Sebring?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.497
How dare you!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.366
How dare you, Dwight?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.868
Don't fire me.
Please.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.870
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you

18:23.903 --> 18:25.172
right here on the spot.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.473
I have excellent
sales numbers!

18:26.506 --> 18:28.175
(Michael)
Not good enough!

18:28.208 --> 18:29.209
I'll do anything!

18:29.242 --> 18:30.710
Anything!

18:30.743 --> 18:32.679
I'll do your laundry
for a month!

18:32.712 --> 18:34.147
For a year!
Michael!

18:34.181 --> 18:35.815
I have a laundry machine.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.751
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.487
[crying]
Please.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.489
Please.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.591
I don't know if I can
trust you anymore.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.792
You can't.
You can't.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.560
But I promise I'll never
betray you again.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.562
What can I do, Michael?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.698
What can I do?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.501
What can I do?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.669
What can I do?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.671
What can I do?

18:58.705 --> 19:01.441
(Michael)
You can get up.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.276
Get up.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.718
And you can
hug it out, bitch.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.495
Hug it out, bitch.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.297
That is what men
say to each other

19:24.331 --> 19:25.398
after a fight.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.466
They hug it out.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.867
And in doing so,

19:27.900 --> 19:30.537
they just let it go.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.439
And walk away.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.807
Then they're done.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.510
Not a good idea to say that
to a woman, however...

19:37.544 --> 19:39.779
I have found.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.682
Doesn't translate.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.718
Captioning by CaptionMax
www.captionmax.com

20:12.545 --> 20:15.715
Yeah. Yeah. We hugged it out.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.452
But it turns out,
I was still a little angry.

20:19.486 --> 20:24.391
So I felt I needed to punish him
just a little bit more.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.426
And I'm making him
do my laundry for a year.
