WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:04.419
I'm officially divorced.
Now what?

00:04.419 --> 00:05.502
Y'know, it's like
one minute you're married,

00:05.794 --> 00:07.128
and the next minute it's like,
"Yeah, bye-bye, see ya.

00:07.128 --> 00:07.961
Nice knowin' ya."

00:08.211 --> 00:10.669
I have to go.
I have a client emergency.

00:13.003 --> 00:14.336
I'm not your biggest emergency?

00:14.336 --> 00:15.336
Oh, not by far.

00:15.753 --> 00:17.544
Robert gets the children
for dinners.

00:17.544 --> 00:19.003
Ellie gets the walls
on the bathroom.

00:19.003 --> 00:20.252
They do not spend the night.

00:20.252 --> 00:22.170
I know you're against it
with money right now.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.336
I need some expert hands.
Pays 20 bucks an hour.

00:24.669 --> 00:26.544
I want to live with you,
not her.

00:26.544 --> 00:28.920
I am the one that always
has to say no to her.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.753
You're the good guy.
You're the fun one.

00:31.336 --> 00:33.003
-You shaved your mustache.
-I did.

00:33.003 --> 00:34.336
Your face looks less...

00:34.794 --> 00:35.920
Is that a compliment?

00:36.669 --> 00:37.961
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
I need to move on.

00:37.961 --> 00:41.003
Clear out all the old shit
and just start fresh.

00:49.711 --> 00:51.336
- Frances: Oh, okay!

00:58.045 --> 00:59.669
- On your left,
on your left!
- I see him, I see him!

00:59.669 --> 01:02.377
- You're making me nervous.

01:02.377 --> 01:04.377
- Calm down.
- Oh, my God.

01:04.377 --> 01:06.252
- Sorry.

01:06.252 --> 01:11.377
Oh, hey, Lila,
I got a reminder about
the family culture thing,

01:11.377 --> 01:13.586
- you know,
at school on Friday.

01:13.586 --> 01:16.920
Who is that, Ava?

01:16.920 --> 01:18.336
No.

01:20.294 --> 01:22.544
Well, I've never been able
to go to that event,

01:22.544 --> 01:24.961
and I want us to make
a super impression.

01:24.961 --> 01:27.377
So, um, what do you think
we should we make?

01:27.377 --> 01:29.711
They say that you're
supposed to bring something

01:29.711 --> 01:32.211
that represents
your heritage.

01:32.211 --> 01:35.252
- I know very little
about our family's heritage.

01:35.252 --> 01:39.211
I think we come
from a long line
of very white people.

01:39.211 --> 01:42.170
You're not going to work
like that, are you?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.086
You look freaky.

01:44.753 --> 01:46.586
Of course not.

01:46.586 --> 01:49.502
Dad always makes
Irish soda bread.

01:49.502 --> 01:52.336
It's not a big deal,
you don't even have to come.

01:59.377 --> 02:00.336
Frances:
Slow?

02:00.336 --> 02:03.003
I'd kill for slow.

02:03.003 --> 02:05.419
Oh.

02:05.419 --> 02:07.003
Hey!

02:07.003 --> 02:09.086
Hey, guys,
you're taking up
the whole lane.

02:09.086 --> 02:12.920
Can we, um--
can we, you know,
make way for ducklings?

02:15.252 --> 02:16.878
Huh.

02:16.878 --> 02:19.461
Well, that was
hostile.

02:19.461 --> 02:20.836
Did you see that?

02:22.045 --> 02:23.794
Hey, sir, can you
cut me a break?

02:23.794 --> 02:25.794
I'm trying to get
my children to school!

02:25.794 --> 02:26.836
- Mom, stop!
- I'm not a child.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.711
- Craig: Back car's
moving, Robert!

02:34.711 --> 02:35.628
Watch your back!

02:49.794 --> 02:53.836
Wow, I guess that's--
I guess that's your Dad's
new job.

02:53.836 --> 02:56.003
Yeah.
Are you happy now?

02:57.669 --> 02:59.502
What's that
supposed to mean, Lila?

02:59.502 --> 03:02.170
What is that
supposed to mean?

03:03.878 --> 03:06.211
Stop arguing with me!

03:06.211 --> 03:09.377
Just-- okay, great.
You're good!

03:09.377 --> 03:12.294
Don't forget,
I'm picking you up at 4:00,

03:12.294 --> 03:14.377
but I'll be on
this side of the street.

03:14.377 --> 03:15.878
Thanks, Tom.

03:15.878 --> 03:18.211
Okay-- ooh-- bye, honey!
Have a good day!

03:18.211 --> 03:21.669
- We'll think of something good
to make for Friday, okay?

03:21.669 --> 03:26.461
- And good luck with
your math quiz, sweetie!
- Oh, um, Mom.

03:26.461 --> 03:28.836
Mom, this one's
falling out.

03:28.836 --> 03:30.920
Oh. Oh, jeez.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.628
Honey, thanks.

03:32.628 --> 03:34.211
What would I do
without you?

03:36.252 --> 03:38.170
Ah.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.961
A hug?
Hug, hug

03:39.961 --> 03:41.461
- Later!
- Houdini!

03:41.461 --> 03:43.502
Little Houdini!
Bye!

03:43.502 --> 03:46.544
And she was like,
"Daddy, if we're not allowed
to eat in the living room,

03:46.544 --> 03:48.711
then why do I find crumbs
in the couch every morning?"

03:48.711 --> 03:50.252
And I'm like,
"'Cause we eat dessert

03:50.252 --> 03:52.669
every fucking night out there
after you're asleep!"

03:56.878 --> 03:57.961
Yeah.

03:57.961 --> 03:59.544
Yeah, now that
I'm divorced,

03:59.544 --> 04:02.170
I can pretty much
eat dessert wherever I want.

04:02.170 --> 04:04.336
Even on the toilet,
nobody cares.

04:05.544 --> 04:08.544
I could pretty much
die in my sleep

04:08.544 --> 04:10.753
and nobody
would find me for days

04:10.753 --> 04:14.753
unless it was
on a Wednesday evening
or alternating weekend.

04:14.753 --> 04:15.920
Then my kids
would find me.

04:18.961 --> 04:21.920
Guys, you wanna get a beer
sometime after work?

04:37.836 --> 04:39.252
- Sure dude, we'll go.

04:39.252 --> 04:41.045
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Oh, cool, yeah.

04:41.045 --> 04:43.878
You know, now that I have
this much free time
on my hands,

04:43.878 --> 04:45.586
maybe I should take
a Spanish class.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.211
That'd be good.

04:47.211 --> 04:49.461
That way, we can...

04:49.461 --> 04:51.377
yeah?

04:51.377 --> 04:54.502
Frances:
Yet again,
I'm the bad guy.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.586
He's the noble one,
sweeping the road.

04:57.586 --> 05:01.794
I feel like
I got sole custody
of Lila's inner bitch.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.128
It's really
unpleasant.

05:06.128 --> 05:08.878
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

05:08.878 --> 05:13.128
she'd probably
hate your guts just as much
even without the divorce.

05:13.128 --> 05:14.961
- That does.

05:14.961 --> 05:16.461
I mean, you can't
take it personally.

05:16.461 --> 05:18.336
- It's not about you,

05:18.336 --> 05:22.003
but, no, I mean,
it is about you,

05:22.003 --> 05:24.794
but, yeah,
you're fucked.

05:24.794 --> 05:26.753
I keep trying
to pick my battles.

05:26.753 --> 05:28.628
You know, I'm afraid
I'm gonna be in
a grocery store

05:28.628 --> 05:30.336
and I'm gonna be forced,
you know, to wring her neck,

05:30.336 --> 05:33.419
and Child Services
is gonna come and
take me away.

05:33.419 --> 05:35.878
Well, technically,
they would take Lila away.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.753
Oh, really?
Well, then I'll leave
that option on the table.

05:38.753 --> 05:41.128
It's just-- did I ever
tell you about this woman--

05:41.128 --> 05:43.920
um, we affectionately
call her Crazy Courtney--

05:43.920 --> 05:46.794
who ripped into her
daughter at drop

05:46.794 --> 05:48.336
I mean, it's--
it's legendary.

05:48.336 --> 05:51.045
Anyway, she cannot step foot
on school property.

05:51.045 --> 05:53.086
This poor woman
has to drop her kid off,

05:53.086 --> 05:56.003
like,
across the street.

05:59.170 --> 06:02.003
No idea, no, thanks.

06:02.003 --> 06:03.794
Tony's voice:
I'm sitting here,
jerking off,

06:03.794 --> 06:07.003
thinking about your tight,
fat, wet, pink pussy...

06:07.003 --> 06:09.086
Oh, my lord,
who is that?

06:09.086 --> 06:13.377
- ...wrapped around
my massive cock--
- Ah.

06:13.377 --> 06:15.961
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.336
Who talks like that?

06:17.336 --> 06:18.794
Who is that?!

06:20.211 --> 06:21.794
- Three's company.
!

06:21.794 --> 06:24.419
- Fuck!

06:24.419 --> 06:26.336
- Oh, my God!

06:26.336 --> 06:28.878
I just saw his penis!
Oh, my God!

06:30.461 --> 06:32.753
Okay, I don't--
I don't know what to say.

06:32.753 --> 06:34.045
- I...
- You're...

06:34.045 --> 06:36.086
- No, you're freaking out.
- ...you're...

06:36.086 --> 06:37.878
- I can tell
you're freaking out.

06:37.878 --> 06:39.544
Yeah, of course
I'm freaking out.

06:39.544 --> 06:40.711
My God, Dallas.

06:40.711 --> 06:44.586
We're talking about
Tony Silvercreek,

06:44.586 --> 06:48.794
who's sole purpose was
to rip me limb from limb.

06:48.794 --> 06:50.794
I mean you're the one
that called him
a Neanderthal.

06:50.794 --> 06:54.878
You're the one that told me
he would eviscerate
his own mother

06:54.878 --> 06:56.711
if there was
a billable hour in it.

06:56.711 --> 06:58.086
You're right,
I stand by that.

06:58.086 --> 07:01.294
He is a vile human being.
I cannot defend it, okay?

07:01.294 --> 07:02.502
I am so sorry.

07:02.502 --> 07:04.086
It's over.
It's over.

07:04.086 --> 07:06.669
Can you just--
could you please

07:09.128 --> 07:12.003
Preferably in
the next two minutes
because my train is coming

07:12.003 --> 07:13.920
and I cannot handle it
if you're mad at me.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.628
You know I had
a very withholding mother.

07:15.628 --> 07:18.252
Really?
Did you sleep with
her archenemy, too?

07:18.252 --> 07:21.544
- Just go get
your train.

07:21.544 --> 07:23.045
Frances.

07:23.045 --> 07:25.211
Frances, I'm gonna call you
from the train, all right?

07:25.211 --> 07:28.252
- Please don't.
- Answer your phone!

07:32.920 --> 07:34.461
Um, Nick?

07:34.461 --> 07:36.003
Honey, did we buy
a fish tank?

07:36.003 --> 07:38.920
This duck
has been vacuum-sealed

07:38.920 --> 07:42.128
to ensure
it will cook evenly
and to perfection

07:42.128 --> 07:45.628
in the next 36 hours
at 180 degrees.

07:45.628 --> 07:48.628
It will literally
melt in your mouth.

07:48.628 --> 07:51.086
Aw, honey,
look at you.

07:51.086 --> 07:53.753
You're in love
with your bunny boiler.

07:53.753 --> 07:55.128
I am.

07:55.128 --> 07:56.669
I am in love with it.

07:56.669 --> 07:59.502
I should've retired
10 years ago.

07:59.502 --> 08:02.669
I realized I'm not
a stressed-out guy.

08:02.669 --> 08:06.544
I'm not the problem,
banking was the problem.

08:06.544 --> 08:08.753
Here, taste this.

08:08.753 --> 08:13.128
This is truffle oil
and Gruyère and chives.

08:13.128 --> 08:15.252
Mmm!

08:15.252 --> 08:17.170
- Delicious!

08:17.170 --> 08:19.045
I gotta run,
Frances needs me
at the gallery.

08:19.045 --> 08:20.377
Here, one more bite.
One more bite!

08:20.377 --> 08:22.086
Big bite!
Come on, here we go.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.377
There, that'll get you
through the day!

08:24.377 --> 08:26.252
Right? Okay!

08:26.252 --> 08:28.211
- Come back
with an appetite!
I will!

08:28.211 --> 08:29.461
Hmm.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.294
Ah, perfect timing,
Mrs. DuFresne.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.669
- Oh, thanks, Charlie.
- You got it.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.045
Hi, um, I'm just
starting the process

09:06.045 --> 09:09.711
- of changing my name.
- M'kay, congratulations.

09:09.711 --> 09:11.170
Thank you.

09:11.170 --> 09:16.377
Fill out... this form

09:16.377 --> 09:18.711
and this one
and this one.

09:18.711 --> 09:21.377
Okay, do I
use my old name
or my new name?

09:21.377 --> 09:23.961
Your old name up here,
your married name down here.

09:23.961 --> 09:25.336
Ah, okay, okay,

09:25.336 --> 09:28.461
but wait,
my-- my old name
is my married name.

09:28.461 --> 09:31.878
I'm going back
to my maiden name.

09:31.878 --> 09:33.336
I just got divorced.

09:33.336 --> 09:35.211
Oh, bummer.

09:35.211 --> 09:38.086
- Not really.
- No, it's just
a lot more paperwork.

09:38.086 --> 09:41.544
- Oh.
- Then you'll have to apply for
a new social security card.

09:41.544 --> 09:42.794
And then
when that comes,

09:42.794 --> 09:44.711
you have to change
your driver's license,

09:44.711 --> 09:46.878
your passport,
your credit card,
your checkbook,

09:46.878 --> 09:50.461
voter registration,
email address, social media,

09:50.461 --> 09:53.836
whatever your
online presence is,
if you have one.

09:53.836 --> 09:55.544
Take this pamphlet.

09:55.544 --> 10:00.252
Boy, sure is hard getting
your old self back, huh?

10:00.252 --> 10:02.878
Yeah, might not
be worth the trouble.

10:05.252 --> 10:06.586
Diane:
Hey, I am with you,

10:06.586 --> 10:08.128
I share your outrage.

10:08.128 --> 10:11.419
But, you know,
even if you take you
out of the equation,

10:11.419 --> 10:14.920
Dallas
and Tony Silvercreek?

10:14.920 --> 10:17.211
She usually goes for
more feminine guys.

10:17.211 --> 10:20.045
Honestly,
if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes--

10:20.045 --> 10:22.461
which I deeply
regret...

10:22.461 --> 10:24.419
- ...I wouldn't
believe it either.

10:24.419 --> 10:27.586
Oh, I'm starving.
You wanna take a lunch break
after I finish this letter?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.461
Sure, but I'm not
eating anything.

10:29.461 --> 10:31.586
What, are you on
another cleanse?

10:31.586 --> 10:34.419
No, it's actually
the exact opposite.

10:34.419 --> 10:37.961
Basically,
since last Tuesday
when Nick retired,

10:37.961 --> 10:39.878
he's now become
a gourmet chef.

10:39.878 --> 10:42.794
He's force-feeding me
seven-course meals
every night.

10:42.794 --> 10:45.419
Well, that is
deeply offensive.
How dare he.

10:45.419 --> 10:47.794
Hey, would you
wanna come over for
dinner tomorrow night?

10:47.794 --> 10:49.045
Could you?

10:49.045 --> 10:51.544
- Yeah, I'm onto you.

10:51.544 --> 10:53.003
You're just
trying to get me

10:53.003 --> 10:55.336
to finish all your
fatty meals for you,
aren't you?

10:58.461 --> 11:02.461
And I still need
some window treatments
and a coffee table,

11:02.461 --> 11:04.920
but other than that,
it's a decent place.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.961
Forget about the coffee table,
do you have a bed?

11:06.961 --> 11:09.003
- Yeah.
- That's all you need.

11:09.003 --> 11:11.045
You're single.
You're a free man.

11:11.045 --> 11:15.461
Oh, so that would be implying
that I'm getting laid a lot.

11:15.461 --> 11:17.336
No, that's
not happening.

11:17.336 --> 11:18.878
No.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.586
Well,
there was this--

11:20.586 --> 11:22.669
this one mom from
my daughter's school.

11:22.669 --> 11:24.794
- She was pretty sweet.
- All right, that's a start.

11:24.794 --> 11:26.128
I mean, you gotta
get a base hit

11:26.128 --> 11:27.669
before you go
on a hot streak, huh?

11:27.669 --> 11:29.003
Yeah, here comes
your next at bat.

11:29.003 --> 11:30.794
Highlander
sampler platter.

11:30.794 --> 11:35.170
Ah, thank you.
Hey, you know,
my friend just got a divorce.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.669
We're not allowed
to date the customers.

11:36.669 --> 11:38.461
Eh, she's not
that hot.

11:38.461 --> 11:40.377
- She shouldn't be
wearing that cross.
- No.

11:40.377 --> 11:41.502
That's disrespectful.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.128
Hmm.

11:43.128 --> 11:45.836
- Morning, Leonard.
- Hi.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.170
( train horn blaring
in distance )

11:56.086 --> 11:57.836
Are you kidding me?

12:01.419 --> 12:05.170
Well, maybe I should just
change my name legally
to Frances DuFuck.

12:05.170 --> 12:08.045
Who does that
in this little hamlet?

12:08.045 --> 12:10.252
Well, I think it's great
that you're changing
your name back.

12:10.252 --> 12:13.003
I would paid my ex
a tidy sum to do that.

12:13.003 --> 12:16.544
I hate that she's still
running around out there
as Mrs. Clavowen.

12:16.544 --> 12:18.836
- Yeah, I'm Mrs. Clavowen!
- Yes, you are.

12:18.836 --> 12:20.878
- Thanks for the Irish
soda bread recipe.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.878 --> 12:23.294
I can't bake at all,
so I'm not gonna hold you
responsible.

12:23.294 --> 12:25.377
- But thank you.
- Hello! Hi, I'm sorry
I'm late.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.377
- Andrew!
- Hey, nice to see you!

12:28.377 --> 12:30.586
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here!
- Andrew: I bought that
for you.

12:30.586 --> 12:32.753
I can't vouch for it,
but the guy in the store
was extremely passionate,

12:32.753 --> 12:34.836
- so, I hope it's drinkable.

12:34.836 --> 12:36.669
This is
my friend Frances.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.878
Frances,
I would like you
to meet Andrew.

12:38.878 --> 12:40.086
- Hi.
- Hello.

12:40.086 --> 12:41.753
- Good to see you.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.794
Nick:
Good to see you.
Glad you're here.

12:43.794 --> 12:47.586
- Well, Frances,

12:47.586 --> 12:49.252
Andrew and I
actually met

12:49.252 --> 12:52.003
at a benefit for
juvenile diabetes
last year.

12:52.003 --> 12:53.920
- It was a blast.
- Nick couldn't go,

12:53.920 --> 12:56.252
and I was seated at
the world's most
boring table.

12:56.252 --> 12:59.128
Literally no one had a pulse,
the average age was,
like, deceased,

12:59.128 --> 13:02.336
and then there was Andrew,
who saved my life.

13:02.336 --> 13:03.628
Are you kidding?
You saved mine.

13:03.628 --> 13:04.920
This woman knows how
to sneak out of a party.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.961
- Oh, I'm a pro.
- I know.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.086
Oh! Oh,
he's welding.

13:10.086 --> 13:12.753
- Smells amazing,
whatever it is.
- It's incredible.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.794
- Et voila!
- Andrew: Oh, yeah, that's...

13:16.794 --> 13:18.711
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's gorgeous.

13:18.711 --> 13:20.961
- Ah, it smells so good.

13:20.961 --> 13:22.294
You don't eat duck?

13:22.294 --> 13:25.586
Uh, no, not really.

13:25.586 --> 13:27.920
I mean I love duck, but I--
I'm not supposed to eat it.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.377
- My cholesterol's sky-high.
- Oh, well, that's too bad.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.211
- But I can eat
all the other sides...
- Diane.

13:33.211 --> 13:34.586
...which look amazing.

13:34.586 --> 13:37.294
I-I'm very sorry,
honey.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.461
You know what, it's--
fuck my cholesterol.

13:40.461 --> 13:42.794
I will have a few bites.
That's what Crestor
is for, right?

13:42.794 --> 13:45.128
Yeah, definitely.
And, Nick, I love duck,
so I can eat both--

13:45.128 --> 13:47.128
- I'll eat both breasts.
- That's not the point.

13:47.128 --> 13:50.461
The point is that Diane
was supposed to ask
our dinner guests

13:50.461 --> 13:52.461
if anyone had
any dietary issues.

13:52.461 --> 13:54.878
- It's fine, really.
It's so fine.
- It's not fine!

13:54.878 --> 14:00.045
I enjoy cooking.
I want my guests to eat
and enjoy what I cook.

14:00.045 --> 14:02.836
I could've just as easily
made my black cod!

14:02.836 --> 14:05.836
I could've made Arctic char,
I was just at the fish place.

14:05.836 --> 14:07.377
I could've
made branzino,

14:07.377 --> 14:09.086
I could've made
Dover sole,

14:09.086 --> 14:11.502
I could've made
a fucking trout!

14:11.502 --> 14:13.419
- Fluke!
- Thank you.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.003
- Sure.
- Skate!

14:15.003 --> 14:16.377
- Let's get out of here,
hot in there.
- Crappie!

14:16.377 --> 14:20.669
Oh, you had to go
and have high cholesterol.

14:20.669 --> 14:23.586
Seriously.
But for the record,
I've never had a cavity.

14:23.586 --> 14:25.586
- Bragger.

14:25.586 --> 14:28.252
So, uh,
what's your story?

14:28.252 --> 14:29.461
Diane
didn't really say.

14:29.461 --> 14:31.211
- Yeah.

14:31.211 --> 14:34.336
Hmm, uh, let's see.

14:34.336 --> 14:36.669
Well, I got married
when I was young--

14:36.669 --> 14:38.836
I mean,
not crazy-young,
I was 28.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.211
- Um...

14:41.211 --> 14:43.669
...and we were
kind of opposites.
I mean, I don't know.

14:43.669 --> 14:45.711
I thought at the time
it was a good thing,
you know,

14:45.711 --> 14:47.878
like we would
complement one another.

14:47.878 --> 14:49.878
- Mm-hmm.
- But it turns out,

14:49.878 --> 14:53.377
um, no,
not complementary.

14:53.377 --> 14:55.920
- So, you're divorced.
- Yes.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.128
- Thanks, yes.
- God, I remember
that time so well.

14:59.128 --> 15:02.711
I hated having to
go through the saga of it
every time I ran into somebody.

15:02.711 --> 15:06.628
I ended up sending
a mass email to
everyone I know.

15:06.628 --> 15:09.086
- Efficient.

15:09.086 --> 15:11.336
Maybe.
Truth is
the beginning is rough,

15:11.336 --> 15:12.544
there's no way
around it.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.045
But here's what
you're in for--

15:14.045 --> 15:15.502
everyone you know
is gonna be setting you up

15:15.502 --> 15:18.045
with totally random
individuals.

15:18.045 --> 15:20.878
- Apparently.

15:20.878 --> 15:25.419
Uh, did you
know about this tonight?

15:25.419 --> 15:28.961
Full disclosure,
you are not the first person
that Diane has set me up with.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.586
Got it.

15:30.586 --> 15:32.586
So, now that you're single,
are you

15:34.753 --> 15:37.794
Oh, swiping.
The dating, swiping.

15:37.794 --> 15:40.170
No, no, no, no,
I haven't taken
the plunge yet, no.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.878
It's sort of
like Disneyland,

15:41.878 --> 15:43.961
like, I'm putting it off
as long as possible.

15:43.961 --> 15:47.170
Well don't start
because you're clearly
a mess, I can tell.

15:47.170 --> 15:48.878
- Yeah.

15:48.878 --> 15:51.003
Yeah, a walking
disaster, I'd say.

15:51.003 --> 15:53.377
Wow, if I wanted to suffer
this kind of abuse,

15:53.377 --> 15:55.920
I could've stayed home
with my teenage daughter.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.419
Diane:
What about
your cholesterol?

15:57.419 --> 16:00.586
This is my one
red meat night
of the month.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.336
I would like
to enjoy it.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.836
Is that asking
too much?

16:03.836 --> 16:06.628
I know the night's
all about you, Diane.

16:06.628 --> 16:07.920
It was all about you
and your...

16:07.920 --> 16:09.920
Ever wonder why
they're still married

16:09.920 --> 16:11.628
and we're divorced?

16:11.628 --> 16:14.128
Nick:
...fucking duck!

16:27.628 --> 16:30.211
Are you questioning
my devotion to the Mets?

16:30.211 --> 16:33.211
I don't know, should I be?
You seem very touchy about it.

16:33.211 --> 16:35.794
I'm starting to think
that's only reason
why you texted me.

16:37.502 --> 16:40.920
Actually, Tony,
I texted you for
a real reason.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.961
- I'll bet you did.
- Uh-huh, oh.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.628
- Wait for it.
- No, you're not-- oh, boy.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.294
- Wait for it.
- Um, okay.

16:47.294 --> 16:50.170
Can I-- could we--
can I get the check,
please?

16:50.170 --> 16:53.336
- Janice: Your new
apartment is nice!
- Robert: Thanks.

16:53.336 --> 16:57.170
So, what do you
wanna do, Robert?

16:58.961 --> 17:00.377
Oh...

17:00.377 --> 17:03.419
- In life, I would like
to pursue--
- To me.

17:03.419 --> 17:07.377
You are so shy,
it is fucking hot.

17:07.377 --> 17:08.711
You know, I was surprised
to hear from you.

17:08.711 --> 17:10.419
It's been so long,
I just assumed that

17:10.419 --> 17:12.502
you and Frances were
giving it another shot.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.336
No, no,
that's over.

17:14.336 --> 17:17.586
She's getting smaller
in the rear view by the day.

17:17.586 --> 17:20.753
Mm, okay, then.

17:20.753 --> 17:23.336
So, you must have
some fantasies, hmm?

17:23.336 --> 17:26.461
Well, I've seen
some stuff online

17:26.461 --> 17:29.920
that wasn't completely
uninteresting.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.211
Yeah, like what?

17:31.211 --> 17:32.586
You want me
to pee on you?

17:32.586 --> 17:34.920
Get you all wet, hmm?

17:34.920 --> 17:38.170
No, thank you, but...

17:38.170 --> 17:39.920
Well, how about
foot sex?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.336
I got really
fat toes.

17:42.669 --> 17:45.045
Yeah, you do.
How would that work?

17:45.045 --> 17:47.794
Oh, I could put
my big toe in your ass.

17:47.794 --> 17:49.711
Or any toe,
whatever.

17:49.711 --> 17:52.377
That is a generous
offer, Janice...

17:52.377 --> 17:54.419
- Mm-hmm.
- ...but I'm gonna pass.

17:54.419 --> 17:57.419
- Okay.
- But let me ask you
about something else.

17:57.419 --> 18:00.753
I've never been
involved in a threesome.

18:00.753 --> 18:02.711
Oh, really?
Okay.

18:02.711 --> 18:04.377
Well, we can
fix that.

18:04.377 --> 18:06.836
You know, I have
some gals in the area

18:06.836 --> 18:09.836
and they love
to party.

18:11.836 --> 18:14.419
- Mm-hmm.
- You just,
"Hey, you wanna drop by

18:14.419 --> 18:15.920
and bone a dude
together?"

18:15.920 --> 18:17.252
You know, I'm gonna
start with Cindy.

18:17.252 --> 18:19.669
- She's the best.

18:19.669 --> 18:22.294
Oh, shit,
she's in court.
That's right.

18:22.294 --> 18:27.252
Man, I've been living
in a fucking birdcage.

18:27.252 --> 18:32.086
I'm getting on
that 7:58 train,
just so you know.

18:32.086 --> 18:35.920
Yeah, yeah, quick and dirty,
just the way you like it.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.836
- Come on!

18:37.836 --> 18:40.336
- Holy fucking shit!

18:40.336 --> 18:42.920
- Ow!
- Holy shit!
Oh, my God!

18:42.920 --> 18:44.878
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Fuck!

18:44.878 --> 18:47.294
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Fuck! No, look at me.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.794
Ah! No, you're
far from fine.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.711
- You need to go to a hospital.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.377
I'll figure it out.
No, I'll figure it out!

18:53.377 --> 18:55.794
You know what, you go on,
you have a nice evening.

18:55.794 --> 18:57.170
There's no way that
you're gonna get a cab

18:57.170 --> 18:58.836
with your face all
fucked-up like that.

18:58.836 --> 18:59.878
- Oh, God!
- Ah, just stop.

18:59.878 --> 19:01.961
Taxi!

19:17.294 --> 19:19.336
Oh, Germany!

19:19.336 --> 19:21.128
Yeah, Guten Tag.
Looks yummy.

19:21.128 --> 19:23.461
- Girl: Hi, Mrs. DuFresne!
- Frances: Hi.

19:25.794 --> 19:28.086
Oh, family trees.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.669
Oh, Henry W.,
Henry T.

19:33.669 --> 19:34.961
Lila!

19:34.961 --> 19:36.836
"My family tree."

19:36.836 --> 19:39.377
Grandma DuFresne,

19:39.377 --> 19:41.461
Dad, Tom, Lila...

19:50.920 --> 19:52.211
Lila:
Yeah, I think so.

19:52.211 --> 19:53.294
Lila!

19:54.502 --> 19:55.669
Come here!

19:55.669 --> 19:58.544
I'll just talk
to you later.

19:58.544 --> 20:01.502
Girl:
It's cool.
I'll see you later.

20:04.753 --> 20:07.794
Why am I not
on your family tree?

20:07.794 --> 20:09.628
Oh.

20:09.628 --> 20:12.086
I didn't have
a picture of you.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.461
You didn't have
a picture of me?

20:14.461 --> 20:16.586
Okay, is that how
we're gonna play this?

20:16.586 --> 20:18.170
What? I don't.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.544
Really?
'Cause just-- just off
the top of my head,

20:20.544 --> 20:22.170
I can think of
three right now.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.711
There is the one
of the four of us
on the dock in Cape Cod.

20:24.711 --> 20:26.502
There's the one
of me and Grandpa
on the fridge.

20:26.502 --> 20:28.628
And there's the one
of me holding you

20:28.628 --> 20:31.294
when you were a tiny baby,
on your bureau.

20:31.294 --> 20:34.878
It's always
about you.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.502
Been there!
You gotta pick
your battles.

20:40.502 --> 20:42.753
Yeah, I just did.
This is the battle
I picked.

20:42.753 --> 20:44.211
- Yeah.

20:44.211 --> 20:46.711
Okay, thanks.
I'll give it
right back.

20:57.086 --> 20:58.961
- So you go
into settings...
- Mm-hmm.

20:58.961 --> 21:01.003
...then you
hit general,

21:01.003 --> 21:04.753
you hit display,
then you hit text size.

21:04.753 --> 21:07.794
And you can make it
as big or as small
as you want.

21:07.794 --> 21:10.419
Oh, my God,
you're saving my life.

21:10.419 --> 21:12.794
- Oh! Okay, this is it.

21:12.794 --> 21:15.753
This is the one,
I can feel it.

21:15.753 --> 21:19.377
Ah, nope.
I am really
striking out.

21:19.377 --> 21:23.586
Um, you wouldn't
do a dude, would you?

21:23.586 --> 21:26.377
- No.
- Just checking.

21:26.377 --> 21:29.753
- Ugh, another "no can do"
from Olivia's mom.

21:29.753 --> 21:32.461
Uh, oh!

21:32.461 --> 21:34.961
They must all be
at that stupid
school event.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.669
I forgot
about that.

21:36.669 --> 21:39.586
- Family Culture Night.

21:39.586 --> 21:42.252
Thank God my kid's
on the chorus trip;
I am off the hook.

21:42.252 --> 21:44.920
- Holy shit,
Family Culture Night.
- Mm-hmm.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.128
That's the best.
Have you ever had
the Garcia's flautas

21:48.128 --> 21:50.211
or the Reifschneiders'
schnitzel?

21:50.211 --> 21:53.086
- That's fucking good eating.

21:55.336 --> 21:58.377
Uh, it's
Frances's night.

21:58.377 --> 22:02.502
Oh, see, my ex and I agreed
that school events are
neutral territory.

22:02.502 --> 22:03.961
Really?

22:03.961 --> 22:08.170
Well, he seems like a decent,
not-at-all-controlling dude.

22:08.170 --> 22:11.794
Well, when it's
about your kid,
fair is fair, right?

22:13.336 --> 22:15.211
Yeah.

22:15.211 --> 22:18.586
And then there was
another time, right,

22:18.586 --> 22:22.294
when I took a fastball
right across the kisser.

22:22.294 --> 22:24.211
Chris Arons was pitching.
I think the little fucker

22:24.211 --> 22:27.377
was doing, like,
I don't know,
85, 90 mph.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.377
See right here,
these two teeth?

22:29.377 --> 22:32.252
- These babies are fake.

22:32.252 --> 22:34.003
- Ah.

22:34.003 --> 22:37.961
- I underestimated you.

22:37.961 --> 22:40.128
You saying you're surprised
I'm not a total fucking dick?

22:40.128 --> 22:41.920
Well, yeah.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.502
The truth is...

22:43.502 --> 22:46.711
the truth is
the reason I wanted
to get together tonight

22:46.711 --> 22:49.836
was to, you know,
just end this,

22:49.836 --> 22:52.502
you know,
whatever this is.

22:54.836 --> 22:58.211
- Come on,
let's be honest,

22:58.211 --> 23:00.003
we were never
gonna be a thing.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.086
Whoa, whoa,
hold on a second,
wait, wait, wait a second,

23:02.086 --> 23:05.377
are you--
are you telling me that
you're breaking up with me?

23:05.377 --> 23:10.211
Do you have any idea
how much snatch I get?
Whenever I want it.

23:10.211 --> 23:12.628
And you know what,
sometimes when I don't.

23:12.628 --> 23:14.461
Do you think I wanna
be here right now
with you?

23:14.461 --> 23:16.669
I could be at the fucking
Rainbow Boom-Boom Room

23:16.669 --> 23:19.336
getting bottle service
off of some Latvian

23:19.336 --> 23:21.377
Victoria's Secret
mid-level sky hostess,

23:21.377 --> 23:23.878
but instead,
I chose to be here.

23:23.878 --> 23:25.252
I chose
to be a gentleman

23:25.252 --> 23:28.128
and to escort
your aging ass
to the fucking E.R.!

23:28.128 --> 23:29.586
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

23:31.170 --> 23:33.544
Could you just pull over
to the next corner, please?

23:33.544 --> 23:36.711
- You have some major
fucking anger issues.

23:36.711 --> 23:38.211
I think you might wanna
look into that.

23:38.211 --> 23:39.586
She's breaking up
with me?

23:39.586 --> 23:41.711
I got the fucking
door, all right?

23:41.711 --> 23:43.753
- Go!
- Ungrateful,
fucking bitch.

23:43.753 --> 23:45.669
- See ya never!
- You're lucky I even
showed up tonight.

23:45.669 --> 23:48.003
- I had Knicks tickets.
- Boring!

23:48.003 --> 23:49.836
You suck in bed.

23:49.836 --> 23:54.252
I would avoid
57th Street, if you can.

23:54.252 --> 23:56.753
Oh, this one's
a little stuck.

23:56.753 --> 23:59.711
Hey, I hear
we have to talk.

23:59.711 --> 24:01.753
Oh, hey, Courtney,
how are you?

24:01.753 --> 24:03.586
Ugh, fine now,
so much better,

24:03.586 --> 24:05.544
but that first year
after the divorce

24:05.544 --> 24:07.586
kicked my ass
from here to Timbuktu.

24:07.586 --> 24:11.794
Gosh, really?
Well, I-- I didn't--
I had no idea.

24:11.794 --> 24:13.544
You know what,
no one knows this,

24:13.544 --> 24:16.086
but things got so bad
with fuckface last year,

24:16.086 --> 24:18.753
I freaked out on Ashley,
and now the school won't even

24:18.753 --> 24:21.628
let me drop her off
on school property anymore.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.794
That's...

24:24.794 --> 24:26.461
- Yeah, seriously!
- ...yeah.

24:26.461 --> 24:27.961
I got an exception
for tonight

24:27.961 --> 24:29.878
as long as we keep
a 50-yard distance.

24:29.878 --> 24:32.628
I'm like,
"Thank you very much!
No problem there."

24:32.628 --> 24:36.669
Well, I'm glad
that, you know--
that you got a furlough.

24:36.669 --> 24:38.045
We should
have drinks sometime.

24:38.045 --> 24:40.086
I can save you
a lot of drama,

24:40.086 --> 24:42.502
a lot of
wasted energy.

24:42.502 --> 24:44.377
Plus, we'd have fun.

24:44.377 --> 24:46.294
Yeah, that's--
thank you.

24:46.294 --> 24:50.252
Fortunately,
Robert and I parted
on very civil terms...

24:50.252 --> 24:52.294
- Mm.
- ...which I'm
grateful for.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.294
Motherfucker!

24:58.294 --> 25:00.294
Hey.

25:00.294 --> 25:01.878
Hi. What are you
doing here?

25:01.878 --> 25:06.794
School is a neutral zone,
and Lila my daughter.

25:06.794 --> 25:09.086
Oh, no,
that I know because
you're on the family tree.

25:09.086 --> 25:10.836
We have
a schedule.

25:10.836 --> 25:12.003
I'm aware
of the schedule.

25:12.003 --> 25:13.502
Doesn't mean that
we have to punish her.

25:13.502 --> 25:16.586
We're not punishing her,
we're establishing a system.

25:16.586 --> 25:20.461
You know, it's for her,
and we have to stick to it
or she's not gonna feel secure.

25:20.461 --> 25:22.086
- She's always gonna wonder--
- Oh hey, Mr. DuFresne!

25:22.086 --> 25:23.878
- Both: Hey, Mr. Glaper.
- Would you and your wife

25:23.878 --> 25:25.252
like to join us
for the presentation?

25:25.252 --> 25:26.628
Both:
We're divorced.

25:26.628 --> 25:28.961
- Okay.
- That's it.

25:30.794 --> 25:32.711
You know what,
forget it, I'll leave.
It doesn't matter.

25:32.711 --> 25:34.544
- She doesn't want me
here, anyway.
- No, nope.

25:34.544 --> 25:36.003
You don't
get to be the martyr.

25:36.003 --> 25:39.794
I'll leave.
I'll be the one leaving.

25:39.794 --> 25:41.753
By the way,
why would you even consider

25:41.753 --> 25:44.878
making my Irish
soda bread recipe
without consulting me?

25:44.878 --> 25:47.294
- You wanted me to
consult you on the...?
- Yeah.

25:47.294 --> 25:50.419
These are not even
real "curronts."

25:50.419 --> 25:52.711
'Cause we only
had "raisons."

25:52.711 --> 25:54.920
Mm-hmm.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.836
I'll have you know
something.

25:56.836 --> 25:59.836
I left a threesome
to come to this.

25:59.836 --> 26:01.878
- Yeah.

26:01.878 --> 26:04.502
There could be
anywhere between
zero and two women

26:04.502 --> 26:06.878
waiting for me
at my apartment.

26:06.878 --> 26:08.920
Maybe even a dude.

26:12.252 --> 26:13.920
- Hey, honey.
- Hey!

26:13.920 --> 26:15.252
See you later.

26:19.961 --> 26:21.878
Why is Daddy
leaving?

26:21.878 --> 26:23.586
Come here, honey.

26:25.461 --> 26:26.920
Daddy knew
it wasn't his night,

26:26.920 --> 26:28.461
he just wanted to come
just for a second,

26:28.461 --> 26:30.003
poke his head in,
and see your family tree.

26:30.003 --> 26:32.502
You'll be with him
all day on Saturday, okay?

26:32.502 --> 26:35.003
So let's go back in,
let's have fun,

26:35.003 --> 26:38.377
get some pirogi,
or the, you know--
the Russian stuff.

26:38.377 --> 26:40.753
No! I didn't even
want you here,

26:40.753 --> 26:42.628
but you
wanted to come.

26:42.628 --> 26:44.294
- You're so selfish.
- Okay, I get that

26:44.294 --> 26:46.045
you don't like me
very much right now.

26:46.045 --> 26:47.419
You've made that
very clear.

26:47.419 --> 26:50.377
I, too, was
a teenager once.
I hated my mother.

26:50.377 --> 26:54.586
I'm sorry, I'm it.
We're stuck with each other.

26:54.586 --> 26:55.753
You're not sorry.

26:55.753 --> 26:57.045
You do
whatever you want

26:57.045 --> 26:58.628
and you're always
embarrassing me.

26:58.628 --> 27:00.544
You're either
in your pajamas

27:00.544 --> 27:02.628
or wearing
too much makeup.

27:02.628 --> 27:04.419
Why can't you
just be normal?

27:04.419 --> 27:06.419
Can you just--
can you lower
your voice?

27:06.419 --> 27:08.836
And were you ever
going to tell us that
you're changing your name?

27:08.836 --> 27:10.878
I saw those forms
on your desk.

27:10.878 --> 27:13.128
You don't even wanna be
in this family.

27:13.128 --> 27:17.294
- That's not true--
Lila, that's just not--
- You're so full of shit!

27:17.294 --> 27:19.961
- Watch your language.
- Fuck you!

27:19.961 --> 27:24.628
Don't you dare
speak to me like that.

27:24.628 --> 27:26.794
Fuck you.

27:26.794 --> 27:28.211
Fuck you!

27:31.586 --> 27:33.753
- Oh, God.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.336
I'm sorry.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.878
- Girl: Okay!

28:20.628 --> 28:22.502
Have a good day.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.711
I packed
the dried figs
you like.

28:30.836 --> 28:32.878
- Hey.
- Morning.

28:35.252 --> 28:36.377
Bye!

28:36.377 --> 28:39.045
Bye!

28:39.045 --> 28:41.377
- Yeah, you
really gotta be loud.
- You gotta project, yeah.

28:41.377 --> 28:42.878
Yeah.

30:10.294 --> 30:12.461
The thing that you said
I shouldn't be doing?

30:12.461 --> 30:13.669
-Mm-hm.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.377
DIANE: We need to talk
this place up tomorrow night.

30:16.377 --> 30:17.753
Make it like a destination.

30:17.753 --> 30:19.711
This is my partner
in our new gallery.

30:19.711 --> 30:21.086
-Hastings.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.628
Is it, like,
folk art kind of stuff?

30:23.128 --> 30:25.586
-Sylvia McDonald.
-I'm trying to find her.

30:25.586 --> 30:27.294
Y'know, maybe she has
some other work.

30:27.294 --> 30:28.961
Are you Sylvia McDonald?

30:29.461 --> 30:31.794
I'm Jackie. My dad and I are
moving into the neighborhood.

30:31.794 --> 30:33.003
ROBERT DUFRESNE:
I'm only gonna sell it

30:33.003 --> 30:34.961
to somebody that's absolutely
crazy about it.

30:34.961 --> 30:37.461
Like, "I have got to have sex
with this house."

30:37.461 --> 30:39.003
I don't wanna have sex
with your house.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.294
Well, I was being figurative.
