00:04.369 --> 00:06.638
Oh my God,
I just sent you

00:06.699 --> 00:08.994
the first trailer
to the "Crows" movie!

00:09.510 --> 00:11.267
- What?!
- My "Crows" movie?

00:11.355 --> 00:12.499
No. Gwen's.

00:12.587 --> 00:14.151
They sent over a little
sneak peak

00:14.239 --> 00:16.111
before it goes live tomorrow.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.796
Oh, Alexis!

00:17.979 --> 00:19.806
This is a critical moment.

00:19.973 --> 00:23.447
A siren call to the cinematic
rapture that is to come.

00:23.535 --> 00:24.542
How did it look?

00:24.630 --> 00:26.363
It like literally
just came through

00:26.474 --> 00:27.887
John, draw the curtains.

00:28.434 --> 00:29.754
- David!
- David: What?

00:29.842 --> 00:31.827
We're going to watch
the "Crows" trailer.

00:32.128 --> 00:33.456
No! No, go away.

00:33.544 --> 00:35.252
Perhaps I should screen it
privately first.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.746
Okay. Well, I'm here now.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.401
So the least you could do
is show me it.

Dad!

00:40.362 --> 00:42.625
John, it's practically
obsidian in here!

00:42.728 --> 00:44.499
You just said
close the curtains!

00:44.587 --> 00:47.155
Okay. Okay,
family, be kind.

00:47.265 --> 00:48.821
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.717
- Okay, we gotta press play.
- Oh. Okay.

Oh, it's just an ad,

- ...friends.
- Well, we best be returning...

01:18.559 --> 01:21.040
Dad, I told you we needed
to upgrade the Wi-Fi.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.224
Oh, this is a no way an
optimal viewing experience.

01:24.312 --> 01:27.099
- It's back!
- Okay, start it over.

You know what, Sweetheart?
Why don't you just give us

01:34.339 --> 01:35.545
a holler when it's ready?

Oh my God, David!
I totally forgot about

01:46.487 --> 01:47.893
the wedding dream book!

01:48.004 --> 01:50.728
Um, where did you find that?

01:50.823 --> 01:51.962
Um, I was looking
for an earring

01:52.049 --> 01:55.694
and found it under your pillow.
Anyway, you did it.

01:55.798 --> 01:59.308
You manifested your wedding
and I'm like literally stunned.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.231
You're stunned.

02:01.581 --> 02:02.988
Yeah, but like in a good way.

02:03.091 --> 02:04.759
Like think of all the people
on the planet

02:04.855 --> 02:07.818
who find someone, somehow
you're one of those people.

02:08.555 --> 02:10.217
I don't know how
to take that.

02:11.118 --> 02:12.443
I mean, you didn't end up
marrying

02:12.531 --> 02:14.219
JC Chasez
or Jenna Elfman.

02:14.307 --> 02:15.986
But I actually feel
like Patrick is kind of

02:16.073 --> 02:17.690
- the best of both of them.
- Mhmm.

02:17.778 --> 02:19.578
Oh, so you're still gonna
do Keira Knightley's

02:19.665 --> 02:22.088

as my maid of honour look?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.313
You know what,
haven't got to that stage

02:25.401 --> 02:27.824
in the planning process yet.
So I'm not quite sure.

02:27.944 --> 02:29.381
Okay. Well, I'm here
for a month

02:29.469 --> 02:31.210
so you better put me
to work while your can.

02:31.397 --> 02:33.513
[Knocking]
Hm. Come in.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.160
Well, if it isn't our very
own little JC Chasez.

02:37.248 --> 02:38.888
- Sorry. Who?
- Ooh, we've been over that.

02:38.980 --> 02:40.680
Um, we should probably go
though.

02:40.768 --> 02:43.565
Oh. Where are my favourite
groom and David off to?

02:43.713 --> 02:45.565
[Polite chuckles]

02:45.720 --> 02:48.465
We are taking Patrick
to get his suit fitted.

02:48.553 --> 02:49.610
What kind of suit?

02:49.698 --> 02:51.389
- Hopefully my wedding suit.
- Oh my God.

02:51.477 --> 02:53.263
Well, I'll just grab my bag,
and come with.

02:53.366 --> 02:55.188
You know what, I don't even
know if that's necessary.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.048
Honestly, David, it's fine.
I'm your maid of honour.

03:00.809 --> 03:02.837
Um... hmm...

03:03.414 --> 03:05.547
Okay re: that.

03:06.277 --> 03:09.328
You weren't supposed to be here
for six months,

03:09.646 --> 03:12.951
so I might have asked
someone else.

03:13.106 --> 03:16.655
Okay. Well, I'm here now.
So...

03:17.073 --> 03:18.617
who did you ask?

03:19.888 --> 03:21.175
If you say Ronnie...

03:21.263 --> 03:22.882
Oh, I don't think
she would have said say yes.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.318
- Does not like him.
- Yeah.

03:24.406 --> 03:26.927
Um, I asked Stevie.

03:27.637 --> 03:30.595
David, you better be talking
about Stevie Nicks.

03:31.774 --> 03:33.514
Stevie said yes?

03:33.602 --> 03:36.011
I mean, it was more
of a reluctant "sure."

03:36.106 --> 03:38.275
Okay, well, it sound like she
doesn't actually wanna do it.

03:38.362 --> 03:40.204
So why don't I just come with,
and I will gently

03:40.291 --> 03:41.832
take it
off her hands.

03:44.445 --> 03:47.385
Fine. But I don't want any
hurt feelings.

03:47.473 --> 03:48.973
Because the last thing
we need right now

03:49.061 --> 03:53.122
is interpersonal conflict
eclipsing my... our day.

03:53.254 --> 03:55.656
Imagine what I could do with
you bachelor party, David.

03:55.926 --> 03:58.087
Diplo still sends me nudes.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.704
- It's a DJ.
- Okay.

[Lock turns, keys jingle]

04:14.968 --> 04:18.163

I'm shocked.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.125
These rooms are
in good shape.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.495
Well, what were you were
expecting, Johnny.

04:22.583 --> 04:23.614
I mean, no offense,

04:23.702 --> 04:25.973
but I don't throw good money
down on lemons.

04:26.061 --> 04:28.167
Who am I,
you buying your car?

04:28.367 --> 04:31.050
Okay, we've had no problems
with the car, Roland.

04:31.248 --> 04:33.346
No, this place has good bones.

04:33.559 --> 04:36.731
Oh, look... the maid forgot
to pick up her tip.

04:37.673 --> 04:39.591
Is that a bag full of money?

04:39.793 --> 04:42.600
Yeah, it's kinda a generous
tip when you consider

04:42.688 --> 04:44.112
she didn't clean up
this garbage

04:44.223 --> 04:45.788
and this loaded gun.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.200
All right. Don't point it,
put it down.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.642
Put the gun down.

04:49.824 --> 04:51.736
Someone's clearly been
squatting here.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.474
And by the looks of it,
they don't appear to be

04:53.561 --> 04:54.608
on the up and up.

04:54.704 --> 04:57.468
Well, maybe Benny
and Betty left this here.

04:57.556 --> 05:00.129
And we just inherited a bag
of money and a gun.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.004
If we're gonna split it up,
I call the money.

05:02.092 --> 05:04.037
We're not taking the money,
Roland.

05:04.142 --> 05:06.693
Whoever left it here is
obviously coming back for it.

05:06.781 --> 05:07.782
Why do you say that?

05:07.870 --> 05:10.020
I left a pack of chewing gum
at the movie theatre

05:10.108 --> 05:11.951
two weeks ago, and I haven't
gone back for it.

05:12.039 --> 05:13.842
Look at this, a cigarette
and a newspaper.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.851
That stuff could've been
here for years.

05:15.939 --> 05:17.926
Then explain why the coffee
is still hot?

05:18.014 --> 05:19.950
It's called global warming,
Johnny.

05:20.038 --> 05:21.744
- Okay.
- Why do you strike me

05:21.832 --> 05:23.596
as one of those people
that doesn't believe in that.

05:23.683 --> 05:26.446
Roland, I say we go
to the police.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.042
We have to let them handle it.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.951
And then what? We offer
our guests a discount

05:30.039 --> 05:32.278
to stay in the middle
of a crime scene.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.584
Then what do you suggest?

05:33.672 --> 05:34.979
Let's stake out the place,

05:35.067 --> 05:36.941

takes their stuff, leaves,

05:37.029 --> 05:38.572
and we can change the locks.

05:40.137 --> 05:42.980
Okay, we give it a day,
see if the guy comes back.

05:43.274 --> 05:46.848
Or gal. This is the 21st
century, Johnny.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.796
- Okay.
- Let's get with it.

I'm with it.

of the afternoon,

06:04.459 --> 06:06.146
must be a solar eclipse.

06:06.234 --> 06:08.181
That's not an eclipse,
Nathaniel!

the whole time?

06:38.804 --> 06:39.988
Indeed it was.

06:40.076 --> 06:42.602
Thanks in large
part to the thaumaturgy

06:42.690 --> 06:44.302
of our special effects
department.

06:44.390 --> 06:45.826
Stunning, isn't it?

06:45.995 --> 06:47.767
What a human beak can do?

06:47.855 --> 06:51.508
So wait. Did you get
the virus in the end?

06:51.913 --> 06:53.034
Was that not clear?

06:53.122 --> 06:54.560
Should we give it
another watch?

06:54.750 --> 06:57.212
No, I think three times
through is the sweet spot.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.088
This is so exciting.

06:59.176 --> 07:01.034
What if it gets nominated
for an Oscar?

07:01.122 --> 07:02.196
Twyla!
No,

Golden Globe, perhaps,

07:06.755 --> 07:08.795
but I won't let myself
envisage that.

07:08.883 --> 07:10.929
I gotta say,
those special effects looked

07:11.017 --> 07:14.066
way better than what I pictured
when you described it.

07:14.238 --> 07:18.172
Credit the technical wizardry
of our team of imaginators.

07:20.781 --> 07:22.462
Gals, we're being rude.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.649
Jocelyn hasn't had a chance
to render her opinion,

07:25.990 --> 07:29.176
though the adulation does
appear to be unanimous.

07:29.585 --> 07:30.925
Well...

07:31.566 --> 07:33.814
it looked just like a real
movie.

for the sizzle reel!

in a real movie.

07:48.149 --> 07:51.324
Anyways, I bet we are dying
to get to rehearsal, ladies.

07:51.412 --> 07:53.165
So let's get those stands.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.432
Of course. We'll pick up this
parley after rehearsal.

07:58.319 --> 08:00.704
- Were the crows nice?
- Hm.

08:01.038 --> 08:03.364
My uncle had a parrot
that just kept asking me

08:03.452 --> 08:04.948
to take my bra off.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.766
Okay, so you guys just
chat up here,

08:11.891 --> 08:13.671
and I'll keep it cool,
keep it casual.

08:13.759 --> 08:14.798
Okay. Here she comes.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.556
She'll probably gonna be
uncomfortable admitting

08:16.643 --> 08:18.173
that she doesn't wanna be
a part of your wedding party,

08:18.260 --> 08:20.715
so I'm gonna make her feel
like she's doing me a favour.

08:20.803 --> 08:22.668
- Patrick: Isn't she though?
- Alexis: Okay. That's funny.

08:22.755 --> 08:24.496
More of that.
But aim it at David.

08:26.301 --> 08:27.999
- [Door shuts]
- Please drive.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.178
[Engine turns]

08:30.266 --> 08:31.964
- Like, now.
- Yep.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.486
So that's your uniform, huh?

08:37.581 --> 08:39.440
You do know that "Pan Am"
was cancelled

08:39.528 --> 08:40.659
after a season, right?

08:40.746 --> 08:42.293
Cool and casual, please David.

08:42.357 --> 08:45.128
I am sitting next to her so I
will be the one to handle this.

08:45.216 --> 08:47.169
This is the flight
attendant's uniform.

08:47.257 --> 08:48.807
Why am I wearing it, you ask?

08:48.926 --> 08:50.594
Because this morning
I found out

08:50.682 --> 08:53.542
I was gonna be a flight
attendant on a real flight.

08:53.629 --> 08:55.919
Wait, didn't you like
just start?

08:56.007 --> 08:58.382
Uh, less than a week ago?
Yeah. Mhmm.

08:58.549 --> 09:00.828
So how safe can the plane be

09:00.916 --> 09:03.490
if I'm the one in charge
of saving people's lives?

09:03.578 --> 09:05.897
Yeah. Yikes. Not safe.

09:05.985 --> 09:08.310
So you probably just wanna like
head home then.

09:08.398 --> 09:10.367
I'm fine. As long as I don't
have to go back there.

09:10.454 --> 09:12.484
I was gonna put my life
in danger for what?

09:12.610 --> 09:13.692
To see the world?

09:13.780 --> 09:16.917
They only fly to Hoboken,
Windsor and South Dakota.

09:17.005 --> 09:18.924
I've actually heard South
Dakota is quite scenic.

09:19.012 --> 09:20.611
Okay.
Did you know that Larry Air

09:20.699 --> 09:22.834
has 18 ongoing lawsuits?

09:23.017 --> 09:25.385
One of which is from Larry
himself.

09:25.473 --> 09:26.862
Wow, okay.
Got it.

09:26.949 --> 09:28.993
I left a job that I actually
liked for this.

09:29.081 --> 09:30.431
What is wrong with me?

09:30.519 --> 09:31.732
How honest do you want us
to be?

09:31.837 --> 09:32.828
Oh no, babe.

09:32.916 --> 09:35.065
It sounds like you have so much
on your plate already,

09:35.152 --> 09:36.805
on top of your bridesmaids
duties.

09:36.945 --> 09:38.765
Are you sure you want
that much stress?

09:38.853 --> 09:39.931
As crazy as this sounds,

09:40.019 --> 09:41.803
I'm actually looking forward
to that.

09:42.176 --> 09:44.633
Feel like it's the only job
I can't mess up at this point.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.119
Totally.

09:51.003 --> 09:52.483
Hmm.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.116
[Door opens]

09:56.575 --> 09:57.871
Okay, Johnny.

09:57.959 --> 09:58.846
[Door shuts]

09:58.934 --> 10:00.805
As soon as we get this place
up and running

10:00.900 --> 10:02.309
the first order of business

10:02.475 --> 10:04.455
is to restock
the vending machine.

10:04.543 --> 10:06.022
Do you know that all they had
was this

10:06.109 --> 10:09.330
Drink Tyme Orange Sodas
and one bag of Poly Puffs.

10:09.418 --> 10:10.914
All right, we're gonna
have to get

10:11.027 --> 10:12.789
some brand names in there.

10:12.918 --> 10:14.665
No, I'm saying get more
of this.

10:14.878 --> 10:18.454
Do you realize that this soda
is made with 99% real drink.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.602
You can't argue
with that kind of math.

10:20.689 --> 10:24.239
Roland, can you focus
on the task at hand please?

10:24.333 --> 10:25.765
If we're gonna be partners,

10:25.853 --> 10:27.765
you've gotta take this job
more seriously.

10:27.853 --> 10:29.910
Well, why do you think
I got these snacks?

10:29.998 --> 10:32.619
I mean we could be on
this stakeout for days,

10:32.707 --> 10:33.969
maybe weeks.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.917
[Car rumbles up]
Someone's coming.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.067
[Door opens]

10:42.417 --> 10:43.940
Get down.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.141
[Door shuts]

10:47.246 --> 10:48.749
[Mouthful]:
It is a man.

10:48.939 --> 10:52.069
Your sexist instincts
were right as usual.

10:52.157 --> 10:53.591
Okay.
Good, good, good.

10:53.678 --> 10:56.507
Maybe he'll just get his stuff
and leave.

10:58.956 --> 11:00.609
He's taken off his jacket.

11:01.936 --> 11:03.963
He's going to the vending
machine?

11:05.654 --> 11:07.832
Roland, we can't have
squatters here.

11:08.028 --> 11:09.943
One of us is gonna have
to talk to him.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.827
Johnny, the guy has a gun.

11:12.447 --> 11:13.680
Okay, then as partners,

11:13.768 --> 11:16.557
I think it's only fair thing
to do is handle this together.

11:16.684 --> 11:17.692
Okay.

11:17.788 --> 11:21.418
I just need a minute to
figure out what I'm gonna say.

11:25.172 --> 11:27.313
[Car rumbles]

11:27.464 --> 11:29.461
[Light knock on door]
Come in.

11:31.239 --> 11:32.301
Oh, good, Jocelyn,

11:32.389 --> 11:33.978
I caught you in a moment
of repose.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.909
Yeah. I was just grading book
reports.

11:36.001 --> 11:37.587
Heh.
Tell me about it!

11:38.618 --> 11:40.246
So how are you doing,
Jocelyn?

11:40.334 --> 11:43.362
You seem to be wishing
to discharge something

11:43.450 --> 11:45.054
from your chest today
at rehearsal

11:45.142 --> 11:47.120
and didn't get a chance.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.590
- Uh, no, I'm fine.
- You're fine.

11:51.022 --> 11:53.046
Why?
Why do you hate my movie?

11:53.134 --> 11:55.223
- I just saw the trailer.
- Exactly!

11:55.311 --> 11:57.844
Yet you've already deemed it
this year's John Carter.

11:57.932 --> 12:00.229
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.612
Just the look in your eyes
sent a chilling,

12:02.700 --> 12:06.115
wet gust of raspberries
to my face.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.579
I just don't like horror
movies.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.176
My first boyfriend took me
to a Michael Meyers movie

12:11.264 --> 12:12.346
and I never got over it.

12:12.434 --> 12:13.712
Not "The Love Guru"?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.405
Moira, you don't really care
if I like your movie?

12:16.493 --> 12:17.660
Don't be giddy.

12:18.479 --> 12:20.845
But just so you know,
Jocelyn,

12:20.989 --> 12:25.406
an actress is only as happy
as her unhappiest audience.

12:32.344 --> 12:34.662
What do we think?
Bow tie or no bow tie.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.125
- Oh, bow.
- No bow.

12:36.328 --> 12:38.808
I sort of feel like bow tie
is kind of classic, no?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.376
Okay, you sort of made it
seem like you weren't sure.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.339
I'm not sure.
But I also very much am.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.971
Also, a black bow ties
photograph better.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.297
I should know.
I once hooked up

12:48.385 --> 12:50.195
with three different
GQ Men of the Year.

12:50.290 --> 12:51.647
At the GQ Men of the Year party.

12:51.735 --> 12:52.824
Okay, sorry.

12:52.912 --> 12:55.716
I'm probably not the person
to ask for fashion stuff.

12:56.015 --> 12:57.862
Um, speaking of maid of
honour duties...

12:57.950 --> 13:00.625
Stevie? Thoughts on
the bachelor party.

13:00.856 --> 13:01.944
Oh-oh.

13:02.032 --> 13:06.742
Um, I think I was just gonna
see what David wanted to do?

13:07.173 --> 13:08.808
Okay. I'm super easy.

13:08.905 --> 13:11.351
Although I did find a gorgeous
ryokan in Hakone

13:11.486 --> 13:13.678
With a hot spring-fed onsen
on the balcony?

13:13.766 --> 13:15.117
Private Chef optional.

13:15.205 --> 13:16.708
But I'm open to other ideas.

13:16.803 --> 13:19.490
Okay. Hot tip: it often makes
for less stress

13:19.578 --> 13:21.840
if you just plan it yourself
and then tell the bride after.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.636
Okay. Stevie,
not hot on that tip. Okay?

13:24.724 --> 13:26.415
Okay, I'm starting to realize

13:26.503 --> 13:29.164
that there's a lot more to this
job than I thought.

13:29.252 --> 13:30.303
Tell me about it.

13:30.405 --> 13:32.335
I once planned
Megan Fox's bachelorette

13:32.423 --> 13:34.827
on this tiny island off
the coast of Montenegro

13:34.939 --> 13:38.881
where nothing is illegal.
Like nothing.

13:39.111 --> 13:42.227
Okay. Are you sure you
shouldn't do this?

13:42.368 --> 13:43.585
Because, I mean...

13:43.673 --> 13:45.768
you're here now,
you're David's sister,

13:45.856 --> 13:48.218
and you're clearly better
suited for the job.

13:48.732 --> 13:50.234
Oh my God, Stevie.

13:50.449 --> 13:53.055
I get why you and everyone else
would be asking that question,

13:53.143 --> 13:55.479
but the answer is...

13:55.567 --> 13:57.909
like maybe?

13:59.652 --> 14:01.071
What am I doing?

14:01.159 --> 14:03.328
Well, we can just crossfade
responsibilities.

14:03.609 --> 14:06.918
No. What am I doing
with my life.

14:07.785 --> 14:10.788
I'm now unemployed
in my thirties.

14:11.082 --> 14:13.085
For the second time in a week.

14:13.173 --> 14:15.483
I left your dad high
and dry at the motel...

14:15.698 --> 14:16.921
and now I'm...

14:17.009 --> 14:18.526
[Stressed exhale]

14:19.727 --> 14:24.555
Okay, all of what you're
saying may be very, very true.

14:24.994 --> 14:29.521
Which is why I will not
let you give up this job.

14:29.609 --> 14:32.011
You can do this.
And if you can't,

14:32.099 --> 14:34.380
I will be here for the whole
month to help you through it.

14:36.222 --> 14:37.484
Bring it in, girl.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.311
Oh no, I don't think
you need to... okay.

14:39.399 --> 14:40.972
[Door creaks open]
[David gasps]

14:41.115 --> 14:42.569
Hey, what do we think
about this one?

14:42.656 --> 14:43.728
Oh my God.

14:43.863 --> 14:47.446
Since when did James Bond
shop to Elm Glenn?

14:47.550 --> 14:49.448
- So that's a yes?
- Yes.

14:49.594 --> 14:52.236
Um, we still need to pick
a tie.

14:53.674 --> 14:56.391
So what does our maid
of honour think?

15:00.528 --> 15:01.803
Hm. Hm.

15:02.088 --> 15:03.661
Which one is your favourite.

15:05.390 --> 15:06.565
Hm...

15:08.115 --> 15:09.691
Yes.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.648
Can we just get married
already?

15:13.108 --> 15:14.309
I'm kidding,
I want pageantry

15:14.397 --> 15:16.159
that takes months
and months to plan.

15:16.802 --> 15:19.233
- Of course you do.
- You look so good.

15:19.337 --> 15:21.386
Fits in the shoulders.
Make you button it up.

15:21.474 --> 15:22.657
[Hushed] Thank you.

15:22.745 --> 15:24.676
[Keys jingle]

15:25.725 --> 15:27.067
Okay.

15:27.412 --> 15:30.134
Oh, I really don't know
about this, Roland.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.137
Still feels like a police
matter to me.

15:32.225 --> 15:34.193
Johnny, you got this.
Relax.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.240
Remember there is two of us,
one of him so.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.240
Okay.
[Knocks]

15:38.328 --> 15:40.017
Of course he does have
that gun.

15:40.695 --> 15:41.713
Yeah?

15:41.801 --> 15:44.553
Hi.
My name is Johnny Rose...

15:47.511 --> 15:49.718
and this is my partner...

15:49.814 --> 15:52.469
[Laughs]
Partner. Partner.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.024
He calls me...
No we actually just met.

15:55.112 --> 15:56.646
What're you, guys, cops?

15:56.734 --> 15:58.910
[Laughs nervously]
No. No, no.

15:58.998 --> 16:00.260
No weapons here.

16:00.348 --> 16:02.009
No, we're um,

16:02.177 --> 16:03.844
we're the new owners
of this motel

16:03.932 --> 16:05.807
and we just stopped by
and say hi,

16:05.895 --> 16:07.331
and to get a little more
information

16:07.419 --> 16:10.343
about what exactly you are
doing here on our property.

16:11.464 --> 16:14.848
And by the way, whatever
you're doing is A-okay with me.

16:14.936 --> 16:18.198
But unfortunately
Professor Prude here

16:18.286 --> 16:19.679
is not too keen on
"squatters."

16:19.767 --> 16:21.531
Who said I'm a squatter?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.881
I'm a long-term tenant.

16:22.969 --> 16:24.849
Betty told me she'd bake
that into the contract.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.236
Bake it into the contract.
Roland?

16:28.535 --> 16:30.454
Was it in the contract?

16:31.214 --> 16:32.970
The contract is like
25 pages.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.687
That's what lawyers are for.
Well, I'm a lawyer.

16:35.774 --> 16:37.776
And I assure you that
it's in there.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.494
You're a lawyer?

16:39.595 --> 16:42.909
Then might I ask
what you're doing here?

16:43.061 --> 16:44.332
I'm a prosecutor.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.222
And uh, when you're putting
away the kind of guys I do...

16:47.310 --> 16:49.137
- Or gals.
- No, never women.

16:49.225 --> 16:52.047
It's always safest
to keep a low profile.

16:52.135 --> 16:54.834
So part of that involved
paying Betty and Benny in cash.

16:55.702 --> 16:57.196
[Relieved exhales]
Okay.

16:57.284 --> 17:01.492
Well, that explains what
that big ole bag was for.

17:01.843 --> 17:03.410
How do you know
I have a big old bag?

17:03.533 --> 17:04.638
I didn't know.

17:04.727 --> 17:06.891
I don't know anything
about a bag.

17:06.979 --> 17:08.819
You guys have been in my
room, haven't you?

17:08.906 --> 17:10.821
You know I keep a lot of very
highly classified

17:10.910 --> 17:13.703
- documents in here.
- Uh, no, it wasn't us.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.325
No.
But we will

17:15.413 --> 17:17.953
make sure
no one ever pokes around

17:18.040 --> 17:19.290
- in here again.
- Right.

17:19.378 --> 17:22.384
We wouldn't want you
to have to use your gun.

17:22.472 --> 17:23.565
You found my gun?

17:23.653 --> 17:25.122
I don't know what
he's talking about.

17:25.209 --> 17:27.686
Obviously you're a valued
guest here.

17:27.832 --> 17:29.834
So here's my card,

17:30.002 --> 17:33.535
and we can set up the same
cash payments

17:33.623 --> 17:36.291
that you gave to Betty.
Have a very pleasant stay.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.749
[Door slams]

17:39.679 --> 17:43.378
Well, Johnny, you still
wanna call the cops?

17:43.472 --> 17:45.779
Okay, you were right on
this one, Roland.

17:45.867 --> 17:48.742
I think this was a pretty
important one to be right on.

17:48.853 --> 17:52.040
Our first guest, not bad, huh?

17:52.128 --> 17:53.372
- Not bad.
- Okay.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.940
How about Good job,
Roland."

17:55.027 --> 17:56.052
Good job, Roland.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.881
You're a professional,
Roland.

17:57.969 --> 17:59.944
Dr. Clara Mandrake:
What have we done?!

18:00.032 --> 18:01.748
[Thunder cracks, crows cawing]

18:01.843 --> 18:04.950
Good. Good.
And the egg-laying feels grounded.

18:05.038 --> 18:07.736
[Door opens]
Hi Moira,

18:07.984 --> 18:09.701
I don't wanna interrupt you,

18:09.789 --> 18:13.578
I can see you're busy...
watching the trailer again.

18:13.768 --> 18:17.517
I just wanted to apologize
for earlier.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.766
No need to self-flagellate,
Jocelyn.

18:19.907 --> 18:22.084
Even if yours is the lone
dissenting voice

18:22.172 --> 18:23.619
in the canticle.

18:23.763 --> 18:26.710
Sorry, Moira,
I think my reason

18:26.798 --> 18:28.927
for not wanting to jump
on the bandwagon

18:29.015 --> 18:31.667
is just that I've seen you
get your hopes up before,

18:31.755 --> 18:34.066
only to be disappointed
when things didn't work out.

18:34.218 --> 18:35.981
I don't require coddling.

18:36.322 --> 18:37.427
I know.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.580
Now that I realize that my
opinion means something to you,

18:41.701 --> 18:44.816
there is a lot that I liked
about the trailer...

18:45.139 --> 18:46.467
Do go on.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.087
[Clears throat]

18:50.385 --> 18:51.996
[reads] "From the first
ominous syllable

18:52.084 --> 18:53.792
of the narrator's tale,

18:53.895 --> 18:56.834
one can feel the hair
on one's arms standing

18:56.922 --> 18:58.710
at affrighted attention.

18:58.964 --> 19:00.855
Yes, there will be blood.

19:00.950 --> 19:03.937
And, yes, you will be
horror-struck.

19:04.048 --> 19:07.536
But, more than that,
you will be lured,

19:07.624 --> 19:11.366
against every instinct
for self-preservation,

19:11.509 --> 19:15.020
to look inside,
and face your very own

19:15.108 --> 19:19.086
futile resistance
to transfiguration."

19:19.465 --> 19:22.163
- Who wrote that?
- I did.

19:22.505 --> 19:24.259
You? You did.

19:24.415 --> 19:28.923
Oh, wow... Jocelyn, thank you.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.835
Nothing about me
or my performance?

19:33.064 --> 19:35.371
Oh. It's just a first draft.

19:35.459 --> 19:36.821
Yes. Okay.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.130
- I really liked your feathers!
- Mhmm.

19:39.218 --> 19:40.262
They're very life-like.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.096
Surprise. They are real.

19:42.651 --> 19:45.498
1200 of them hand-sewn
into my costume.

19:45.586 --> 19:46.588
Mhmm.

19:46.676 --> 19:49.113
The live crows on set
welcomed me as their own.

19:49.444 --> 19:50.837
One even tried to mate.

19:50.925 --> 19:54.407
- Ooh. Sounds dangerous.
- [Chuckles] Wow.

19:54.632 --> 19:58.121
Perhaps one more watch to get
your superlatives surging anew?

19:58.209 --> 20:00.491
Oh Moira, I'm sure
that you're tired and...

20:00.579 --> 20:01.578
okay.

20:01.666 --> 20:02.882
Trailer Voice: <i>"There was
a time</i>

20:02.969 --> 20:04.691
<i>when the Crows were our
friends."</i>

20:04.779 --> 20:06.651
- That voice really is creepy.
- Shh.

20:12.676 --> 20:14.009
Wow, so what happened?

20:14.097 --> 20:16.265
She was ready to hand over
the crown.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.862
Oh, she was, but...

20:17.950 --> 20:19.681
I feel like she needs it
more than I do.

20:19.769 --> 20:21.453
Wow. Who are you?

20:21.541 --> 20:22.836
I know, right?
Like what's happening to me?

20:22.923 --> 20:25.441
- You're going soft.
- Ugh.

20:25.529 --> 20:27.588
But don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

20:27.777 --> 20:29.342
Anyway, it might kill
me on the day,

20:29.430 --> 20:30.916
but I'm glad that she actually
found something

20:31.003 --> 20:33.338
- to distract herself.
- Hm. Mhmm.

20:34.419 --> 20:36.199
Speaking of the day...

20:36.484 --> 20:37.831
I have a better job for you?

20:37.919 --> 20:39.727
Okay. I think it would be
a weird look for me

20:39.815 --> 20:41.682
to be a flower girl
at my age, David.

20:42.126 --> 20:43.620
I've thought about it...

20:44.334 --> 20:46.250
and I want you
to give me away.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.593
Oh my God, David.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.288
That's like arguably the most
important role of the wedding.

20:53.376 --> 20:55.624
A simple yes or no is fine.
No need to pull focus.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.802
Okay.
I do.

20:58.556 --> 20:59.570
Great.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.672
Although now that I think
about it,

21:01.894 --> 21:03.736
I could also be the flower girl.

21:03.824 --> 21:06.695
Like come out first, wearing a
gown made entirely of flowers...

21:06.783 --> 21:08.432
- No.
- Just walk down the aisle,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.070
- and loop back...
- Absolutely not.

21:10.158 --> 21:11.999
And then quick outfit change,
and we're up.

21:12.321 --> 21:14.318
I take it back,
I'm gonna ask Jocelyn.

21:15.794 --> 21:19.475
- Hm. Hey...
- Enough.
