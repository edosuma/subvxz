00:01.000 --> 00:15.000
<i> </i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.349
<i> This sound we're going
to record with a tape recorder.</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:18.781
<i>- Brad?
- Here we go.</i>

00:18.786 --> 00:20.016
<i>- Brad?
- Yes.</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:21.191
<i> Do you want me
 to lay out again</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:22.318
<i> after that instrumental break,</i>

00:22.323 --> 00:23.763
<i> and then come back in
 with the fours</i>

00:23.758 --> 00:25.418
<i>t oward the end of the, uh--
 like, before "C"?</i>

00:25.426 --> 00:27.426
<i> We'll have you wail on
that baby, for the instrument...</i>

00:27.428 --> 00:28.858
<i> Here we go!
 This'll be what?</i>

00:28.863 --> 00:30.133
<i> Okay, take two.</i>

01:05.699 --> 01:08.169
<i>- Alvin!
 - Okay!</i>

01:13.274 --> 01:17.644
<i> It's 5:00 in Los Angeles!</i>

01:32.592 --> 01:36.502
The Wrecking Crew was
the focal point of the music.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.897
They were the ones
with all the spirit,

01:38.899 --> 01:41.269
and all the know-how,

01:41.268 --> 01:43.138
especially for rock and roll
music.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.882
<i> In the hardcore
 producing area,</i>

01:53.881 --> 01:55.311
<i> everybody knew
 what went on there.</i>

01:55.316 --> 01:57.716
I mean, everybody knew
that the best musicians

01:57.718 --> 01:59.148
played on all the sessions,

01:59.153 --> 02:01.293
but we as the general public
didn't know.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.818
I had no idea
that certain people

02:03.824 --> 02:06.464
didn't play their own records
until The Monkees came along.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.840
They played so well, and
they played so well together.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.337
I think they were so into that.
They all respected each other,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.471
and they all would
sit and hang--

02:22.476 --> 02:25.376
You know, talk
in between takes and hang.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.109
I mean, it was like--
it was a social event

02:27.114 --> 02:30.554
for these guys too.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.321
<i> What was nice
 about that unit</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.390
<i> was that they played
 together a lot.</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:38.319
And so they were
an established groove machine.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.155
They knew each other.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.501
So you could really count on
what they had to offer.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.767
We played on everybody's.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.568
<i> The Lazy-Crazy-Hazy Days
 of Summer album</i>

02:49.570 --> 02:51.800
with Nat King Cole,
it was the same guys doing that

02:51.805 --> 02:53.765
that was doing The Beach Boys.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.214
The musicians were really
the unsung heroes

02:56.210 --> 02:57.780
of all those hit records.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.448
When I listen
to the records,

03:02.449 --> 03:05.879
it is so apparent
that these guys

03:05.886 --> 03:07.646
were just really so good.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.815
And you can see why
everybody used 'em, you know?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.724
Because they were so tight.

03:12.726 --> 03:17.896
They were the stone cold
rock and roll professionals,

03:17.898 --> 03:21.328
and there may never, ever be

03:21.335 --> 03:24.165
a group of rock and roll
musicians

03:24.171 --> 03:25.901
of that caliber again.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.451
<i> The chances are,
 you didn't know his name.</i>

03:39.453 --> 03:42.623
<i> But it's likely you sang and
 hummed along with his music.</i>

03:42.623 --> 03:45.563
<i> Famed studio guitarist
 Tommy Tedesco has died.</i>

03:46.659 --> 03:48.159
<i> I'm Kurt Loder
 with an MTV news brief.</i>

03:48.162 --> 03:49.632
<i> Tommy Tedesco was arguably</i>

03:49.630 --> 03:51.700
<i> the king of Los Angeles
 session guitarists.</i>

03:51.699 --> 03:53.969
<i> You've probably never
 heard his name</i>

03:53.968 --> 03:55.998
<i> or heard him speak,
 but listen.</i>

03:56.003 --> 03:57.373
<i> He is someone
 you've heard before.</i>

04:00.975 --> 04:03.405
<i> He was featured
 in the theme to Bonanza ...</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:05.878
<i> in Batman.</i>

04:05.879 --> 04:08.179
<i> The chores!</i>

04:08.182 --> 04:09.312
<i> The stores!</i>

04:09.316 --> 04:10.616
<i> Tedesco died of cancer Monday</i>

04:10.618 --> 04:11.978
<i> at his home
 in Northridge, California,</i>

04:11.986 --> 04:13.416
<i> at the age of 67.</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.050
<i> While his name may not be
 immediately familiar</i>

04:15.055 --> 04:18.785
<i> to everyone, some aspect of
 his music almost certainly is.</i>

04:18.791 --> 04:20.091
Here's the irony.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.564
You spend your whole life
playing guitar,

04:21.562 --> 04:23.062
creating guitar licks
that people

04:23.063 --> 04:24.533
all around the world recognize.

04:24.531 --> 04:27.201
But nobody knows your name,
until you're dead.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.171
And then, even in the end,

04:29.169 --> 04:30.799
they misspell your name
and call you...

04:30.804 --> 04:32.804
<i>- " Tony Tedesco."
- . .. instead of Tommy.</i>

04:34.341 --> 04:36.911
Tommy was not only
a legendary guitarist.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.340
He was my father.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.875
And he was also a member
of an elite group

04:40.881 --> 04:44.521
of studio musicians.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.188
So what follows
is the story of my father

04:47.187 --> 04:50.187
and his extended family,
The Wrecking Crew.

04:58.264 --> 05:01.504
Hondells, Marketts,
Routers--

05:01.502 --> 05:03.642
We'd cut the tracks
and the records,

05:03.637 --> 05:06.237
and then they'd form a group
to be that group.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.640
People were really
not focused

05:08.642 --> 05:14.382
on the long, drawn-out album
recording sessions.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.651
Four songs in three hours.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.721
<i> It's only a certain group
 of guys can do that.</i>

05:19.720 --> 05:21.790
A lot of the recording
came out here.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.859
That's when you had an influx
of a lot of New York musicians.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.528
<i> That was in the mid-'60s,</i>

05:27.528 --> 05:29.428
<i> when they started
 flowing out here.</i>

05:29.430 --> 05:31.130
<i> Then it became a flood
 around that time.</i>

05:33.434 --> 05:34.474
This led to a surge of work

05:34.468 --> 05:36.068
for the L.A. studio musicians.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.600
Not all of 'em,
but a small group,

05:37.604 --> 05:40.114
who later became known
as The Wrecking Crew.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.718
It wasn't an organized band
of musicians

05:49.717 --> 05:51.547
that set out
to take over rock and roll.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.022
And I can't tell you
exactly who was part of this

05:54.021 --> 05:55.521
hit-making machine.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.392
Even the musicians
that were part of this scene

05:57.391 --> 05:58.821
couldn't come to an agreement.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.056
Twelve, 15 people.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.060
Maybe what, 20 of us?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.332
Thirty, maybe?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.100
It was probably
20 musicians,

06:05.099 --> 06:06.399
or maybe a few more,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.100
counting the string players,
of course.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.002
They were doing
all the sessions.

06:10.003 --> 06:15.573
<i>They were a product
 of the '40s, '50s, and '60s.</i>

06:15.576 --> 06:18.506
<i> And they were great musicians</i>

06:18.512 --> 06:22.552
<i> who came of age
when rock and roll came of age.</i>

06:22.549 --> 06:26.349
And here they are at the height
of their physical powers

06:26.353 --> 06:28.393
with all of this talent.

06:28.389 --> 06:32.489
And they're in the right place.
And it's the right time,

06:32.493 --> 06:35.993
and so they get to do this.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.343
On the first day of shooting,
I brought

06:51.345 --> 06:53.975
four of L.A.'s greatest
session players together.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.621
Carol Kaye,
Plas Johnson

06:56.617 --> 06:58.947
and Hal Blaine,
along with my father.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.492
It was probably the first time
that all four

07:01.488 --> 07:03.288
had been in the same room
in about 20 years.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.420
Do you recognize me--
You've lost weight!

07:05.426 --> 07:07.226
And all you have to do is
just get sick.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.760
<i>Rolling.</i>

07:15.702 --> 07:18.472
<i>- Rolling.
- Okay, the question is--</i>

07:18.472 --> 07:20.112
This is not, uh--

07:20.107 --> 07:22.737
You know, if all the guys
that had been in the studios--

07:22.743 --> 07:25.043
God bless 'em all--
For 20, 30 years,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.745
they all wore the blue blazers,
the neck ties,

07:27.748 --> 07:30.718
and there was no talking,
no smoking, and no nothing.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.447
And we came in there
with Levis and t-shirts,

07:33.454 --> 07:35.424
smoking cigarettes,
whatever we're--

07:35.422 --> 07:36.992
Yeah.
- And the older guys

07:36.990 --> 07:38.920
were saying, "They're gonna
wreck the business."

07:38.926 --> 07:41.156
You know, "They are gonna wreck
the music business."

07:41.161 --> 07:43.431
We didn't have the respect
that the older guys had.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.800
<i> Remember the older
 studio players,</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:47.068
<i> Barney Kessels,
 and the Lloyd Elliots,</i>

07:47.067 --> 07:48.967
<i>-  all these people?
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:50.939
Well, that's how that whole
wrecking crew thing came in.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.768
Even though the term
"The Wrecking Crew"

07:52.773 --> 07:55.343
gained popularity
with rock historians,

07:55.342 --> 07:57.312
many of these musicians
never heard the term

07:57.311 --> 07:58.941
until years later.

07:58.946 --> 08:02.046
I think Hal Blaine was
the first one I heard it from.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.279
- Yeah, it--
- He probably

08:03.283 --> 08:04.483
came up with the name.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.485
I think it kind of evolved
really.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.787
- There was--
- The first time I heard

08:07.788 --> 08:09.188
the name, I think
was at The Baked Potato,

08:09.189 --> 08:10.459
where they had
that get-together.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.757
They used the expression
"the wrecking crew."

08:11.758 --> 08:13.328
Well, it was used before that.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.187
It was used
while we were recording.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.756
And the definition of who was
a member of The Wrecking Crew,

08:18.765 --> 08:20.595
there really isn't
any definition.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.531
Between the engineers,
producers

08:22.536 --> 08:24.096
and musicians themselves,

08:24.104 --> 08:27.414
each has their own take
on how this all went down.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.607
Together, they form
a snapshot of a time

08:29.610 --> 08:32.880
that will never be repeated.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.450
Anybody could do
five or six different things

08:36.450 --> 08:38.650
on as many different
instruments also.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.352
There were a lot of producers
at that time

08:40.354 --> 08:41.754
that were not really musicians,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.955
so these guys were able
to decode--

08:43.957 --> 08:45.887
He's talking about me,
by the way, so--

08:45.893 --> 08:47.293
No, I mean, there were
some producers

08:47.294 --> 08:48.834
that really just, you know,

08:48.829 --> 08:50.529
didn't really know
the musicians' language,

08:50.531 --> 08:53.471
and these guys were able
to just quickly interpret it.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.667
The people
we're talking about

08:54.668 --> 08:56.428
played for so many people

08:56.436 --> 08:57.796
in so many
different styles.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.544
That's a fascinating thing.

08:59.540 --> 09:04.280
They could walk into, uh,
a pop sound, and play it.

09:04.278 --> 09:05.378
They could do
rhythm and blues.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.049
They could do
soul music.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.307
I guess they could have done
classics if they'd had to,

09:09.316 --> 09:10.646
but they had
the magic touch.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.291
We injected
a lot of ourself into it,

09:13.287 --> 09:14.847
because we were
experts at doing it.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.285
<i> We were doing it
 all the time.</i>

09:16.290 --> 09:18.460
<i> A guy would give us
 a lead sheet or something,</i>

09:18.458 --> 09:19.788
<i> and we'd know
 what the song was.</i>

09:19.793 --> 09:21.433
<i> We made up a lot
 of arrangements and so forth</i>

09:21.428 --> 09:24.758
<i> on that set,
 ourselves on those things.</i>

09:24.765 --> 09:27.225
<i>Here's the way
that The Beat Goes On sounded</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:28.434
when we first heard it.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.175
I said, "Uh-oh,
we need to pull

09:43.183 --> 09:44.983
a rabbit out of a hat
for this one," you know?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.685
It was our job to come up
with riffs and stuff,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.858
so about the third line
I came up with was:

09:58.865 --> 10:01.365
And Sonny loved it
and he gave it to Bob West,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.998
the bass player, to play it.
And both of us are playing it

10:04.004 --> 10:06.814
throughout the tune.
And without a good bass line,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.567
the tune doesn't pop,
you know,

10:08.575 --> 10:10.605
it doesn't snap, you know,
like a big hit record.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.778
I've always said,
"They put notes on paper.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.624
They put notes on paper,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.920
but that's not music."
You make the music.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.362
What do you do with the notes?

10:23.357 --> 10:24.757
- Right.
- What you do with the charts?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.058
- Absolutely.
- What you do with the chords?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.689
Other than that,
they can call the union

10:27.694 --> 10:29.264
- for a guitar player.
- That's right, so--

10:29.262 --> 10:30.762
So it's what
you put into it,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.664
because how many days are,
in fact, we're all here.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.726
And it's what you put into it
that's not written.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.265
Yeah, well, in fact, everybody
can-- that's sitting here,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.070
I remember doing
different things

10:39.072 --> 10:40.972
that weren't
ever even thought about.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.014
And then, all of a sudden,
become part of the record,

10:43.010 --> 10:44.780
and part of signature
of the record.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.538
We all used to produce our own
parts. It's that simple.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.176
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- To make it swing, yeah.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.156
You know, the first thing
that I ever did

11:02.162 --> 11:04.132
that smacked of any kind
of rock and roll

11:04.131 --> 11:06.061
was some kind of date,
which I don't even know

11:06.066 --> 11:09.166
who the artist was.
There wasn't a minor 7th chord

11:09.169 --> 11:12.469
in the bushel, you know?
It was all pretty vanilla.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.212
That's when I knew
something was different.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.467
<i>At the time, I was doing
the Ozzie And Harriet TV show.</i>

11:16.476 --> 11:17.906
- Ah.
- Then all of a sudden,

11:17.911 --> 11:19.811
you know, I'm doing this show.
And then, they--

11:19.813 --> 11:22.013
One day, they come up with--
Well, Jimmie Haskell comes up...

11:22.015 --> 11:23.845
- with Ricky Nelson.
- And with Ricky Nelson, said...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.220
- It's rock and roll.
- "We're doing

11:25.218 --> 11:26.518
this rock and roll stuff."

11:26.520 --> 11:27.820
I don't know
what they're talking about.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.151
Just laid out a chord sheet,
and says,

11:29.156 --> 11:30.686
- "Play behind Ricky Nelson."

11:30.691 --> 11:32.421
So pretty soon,
you've ended up--

11:32.426 --> 11:34.226
We were starting
to get involved in this.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.374
That's what took me to L.A.
in-- In 196--

11:44.371 --> 11:48.171
Summer of 1960, uh, to play
in the Ricky Nelson band.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.006
<i> Working with those people
 like that</i>

11:51.011 --> 11:54.081
<i> was a perfect showcase
 for what would happen later.</i>

11:54.081 --> 11:57.181
Which I had no idea
that I would ever be

11:57.184 --> 12:00.054
the "session" player.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.353
I didn't even know
what that meant.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.585
<i> We learned how to play
 rock and roll</i>

12:04.591 --> 12:05.861
<i> right there on the job.</i>

12:05.859 --> 12:07.159
Hey, you know,
if they want this...

12:09.029 --> 12:10.759
I can do that.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.704
You know, that's Latin--
That's Latin music.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.700
That's nothing, you know.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.665
You can do that
all day long.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.214
There were some purists,
like there is

12:23.210 --> 12:26.880
in every way of life,
some people will not compromise.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.850
Not that they couldn't.
They wouldn't, most of the time,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.180
permit themselves
to, you know--

12:32.185 --> 12:34.715
They felt that they were
at a certain level.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.591
And playing rock and roll

12:36.590 --> 12:38.160
was perhaps a little bit
beneath them.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.818
<i> And they didn't want
 to get into it,</i>

12:39.826 --> 12:42.986
<i> whereas, our guys,
 we welcomed the rock and roll.</i>

12:42.996 --> 12:45.496
They didn't play that shit.
they didn't know about it.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.929
They didn't like it.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.943
And I started out
playing demos mainly,

12:50.937 --> 12:54.237
you know, $10 a song,
and I got to eat that day, and--

12:54.241 --> 12:57.211
I had three kids to earn
a living, and that's it.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.710
And the money was important
to pay the rent.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.084
And so I did what
all the rest of the guys did.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.853
I got, uh,
a fender guitar

13:06.853 --> 13:09.493
and put the light gauge strings
where you could

13:09.489 --> 13:10.959
bend 'em from here
to Christmas.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.317
And listened to some of
the people that were doing this,

13:13.326 --> 13:16.926
and the rock groups, and I got
so I could play that stuff

13:16.930 --> 13:18.860
better than they could.

13:18.865 --> 13:22.125
The very first call
I had ever had at Disney,

13:22.135 --> 13:25.265
we got there a quarter to 12:00,
and all the blue blazers

13:25.272 --> 13:27.242
were leaving.
And we're all sitting there,

13:27.240 --> 13:31.940
and he makes a little speech
about, "Ladies and gentlemen,

13:31.945 --> 13:35.875
we brought you in here
because in this particular film,

13:35.882 --> 13:37.582
we're gonna do a little--
Some of your--

13:37.584 --> 13:40.354
- your rock and roll music."
- "Your rock and roll music"?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.423
"It is this"-- Yeah.
"There's a little scene here..."

13:42.422 --> 13:44.192
- It always happens to me.
- "...and we're gonna show it

13:44.191 --> 13:45.761
to you," And it was
a quick, little scene,

13:45.759 --> 13:48.659
so he says, "Now, we have
all the music for you.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.462
It's there in front of you.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.263
And we're gonna do this to what
we call a 'click track.'"

13:53.266 --> 13:54.966
Like, we didn't know
anything was going on.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.038
"We're gonna run
the click very slow

13:57.037 --> 14:00.567
so that you can all learn,
study, and memorize this music."

14:00.574 --> 14:04.644
And then he said, "Mary Anne,
play the click much slower."

14:04.644 --> 14:06.314
Well, she accidentally hit it,

14:06.313 --> 14:08.113
and the minute
we heard eight clicks,

14:08.114 --> 14:10.754
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-
ding-ding-ding, we're in.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.080
And we play this thing
front to back.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.586
And when we finished,
this guy said,

14:16.590 --> 14:18.190
"How in the--
man, you did it perfect.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.631
- I wish we'd have made that."
- "Made it."

14:20.627 --> 14:23.387
"How in the world
could you do that?"

14:23.396 --> 14:26.526
And Tommy said, "We practice
a lot during the day."

14:26.533 --> 14:28.873
It was perfect, 'cause they--

14:28.869 --> 14:29.999
they thought you were
a complete idiot.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.303
I mean, it was unbelievable.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.482
Most of the music
and the money--

14:37.477 --> 14:39.777
I was about to say-- It was
a Freudian slip, but true--

14:39.779 --> 14:41.179
came out of the Brill building
in New York.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.051
It was New York-based,
New York writers,

14:43.049 --> 14:45.019
New York singers,
New York musicians.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.318
The music business was
in New York city,

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
period, at that time.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.491
Rolling master "A."

14:49.489 --> 14:51.959
Master "A," take one.
Here we go, rolling.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.429
<i> Say, Chess Records
 back in Cincinnati.</i>

14:58.431 --> 15:00.201
But there were only maybe
one guitar player,

15:00.200 --> 15:02.000
one bass player,
one piano player,

15:02.002 --> 15:04.672
so it could almost get held up
by those one or two guys.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.201
Well, they could come
to Los Angeles,

15:06.206 --> 15:07.836
and they-- It wouldn't
matter if they could call

15:07.841 --> 15:09.641
a matter of 10 or 12
different guitar players,

15:09.643 --> 15:11.043
all of them would be
equally as good

15:11.044 --> 15:12.344
to do what they wanted done,

15:12.345 --> 15:14.175
plus we had more studios
out here.

15:14.180 --> 15:17.350
A lot of the musicians
that were back east,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.650
and in Nashville,
a lot of 'em came out here

15:19.653 --> 15:21.393
to seek their fame
and fortune.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.148
<i> This was
 an untapped place for--</i>

15:23.156 --> 15:25.086
<i> for new artists
 to record too.</i>

15:25.091 --> 15:27.331
Lee Hazlewood told me
he went back to New York

15:27.327 --> 15:29.657
to do a session,
and he just kind of walked

15:29.663 --> 15:31.033
over to the guitar player,
and said,

15:31.031 --> 15:32.261
"Hey, could you play me
this little thing?"

15:32.265 --> 15:34.725
And the guy said,
"Write it out."

15:34.734 --> 15:36.404
And the guy just refused

15:36.403 --> 15:39.443
to experiment and try anything.
Like, if it wasn't written out,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.539
he wasn't gonna play it.
You had young musicians

15:41.541 --> 15:42.811
who were willing to contribute

15:42.809 --> 15:44.379
and come up with ideas,
you know,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.907
and I think that
was the difference.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.353
<i> I don't think
 it's any secret.</i>

15:48.348 --> 15:51.848
The '60s called
all of the music to the west.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.791
L.A. was the place to be.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.957
If you wanted the best, they
were right here, in Los Angeles.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.131
It was a rougher, looser sound

16:10.136 --> 16:12.236
than what was
coming out of New York,

16:12.238 --> 16:14.268
having a lot to do with,
I guess, the musicians

16:14.274 --> 16:17.244
that we were using, 'cause
they were fresh to the sound.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.324
Hal, you started
the surf

16:29.322 --> 16:32.562
and Earl started
that double time, you know.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.472
You know-- You know, we
doubled it up and made it sweet.

16:42.469 --> 16:46.269
Yeah, it was sort of like
east coast/west coast jazz.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.372
There was really
a distinct difference.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.275
And at-- for those years,
the record producers

16:51.277 --> 16:52.937
- chose the west coast.
- Yeah,

16:52.946 --> 16:55.106
and the hits started
coming out of here.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.547
This was where
the youthful movies

17:02.555 --> 17:04.555
were being made.
Everybody wanted to be a surfer.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.357
Whether you were white
or black or lived

17:06.358 --> 17:08.329
in the middle of the desert,
you wanted to have a surfboard.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.157
It was crazy.
And along with it

17:10.163 --> 17:13.203
came young music,
and it was created here.

17:13.199 --> 17:18.469
<i> Beach beauties everywhere,
and art lovers willing to look.</i>

17:18.471 --> 17:21.810
<i> This is paradise for thousands
 of sun worshipers,</i>

17:21.808 --> 17:24.278
<i> Californians by birth
 or adoption.</i>

17:24.277 --> 17:27.877
I remember the perfumed air,
the night-blooming jasmine,

17:27.881 --> 17:29.981
and all the kind of plants
that grow

17:29.983 --> 17:33.793
in Southern California,
and how dreamy it all was.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.287
It was the sound
of The Beach Boys

17:35.288 --> 17:38.658
kind of wafting through
from house to house,

17:38.658 --> 17:41.588
you know, almost the same record
just repeating,

17:41.594 --> 17:44.034
and the idea that,
"Hey, this is real.

17:44.030 --> 17:47.030
this is the culture here,
is this beach thing."

17:47.033 --> 17:50.203
<i>-  The Beach Boys!</i>

17:50.203 --> 17:51.773
Thank you very much.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.141
Right now, we'd like to show you
how The Beach Boys

17:54.140 --> 17:56.010
go about making a record.

17:56.009 --> 17:58.709
We start with Denny Wilson
on the drums...

18:03.416 --> 18:06.876
...followed by Al Jardine
on rhythm guitar...

18:11.091 --> 18:14.191
...helped out
by Carl "lead guitar" Wilson...

18:18.531 --> 18:20.771
...and filled out instrumentally
by our leader,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.997
Brian Wilson on the bass.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.335
When we're ready to sing,
we step up to the microphones,

18:31.344 --> 18:33.044
and it comes out
something like this.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.085
<i> I went
 to Gold Star,</i>

18:48.094 --> 18:51.504
<i> and I met musicians' favorite,
 Phil Spector,</i>

18:51.498 --> 18:55.098
And I immediately had
Steve Douglas start booking,

18:55.101 --> 18:56.601
you know, the re--
They're called the regulars,

18:56.603 --> 18:59.243
The Wrecking Crew.
And he started booking them

18:59.239 --> 19:01.239
for me in my studio
in Western.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.641
Session players were
brought in by producers

19:03.643 --> 19:05.543
for a variety of reason.

19:05.545 --> 19:09.545
In fact, most of the mid-1960s,
beach boys backing tracks

19:09.549 --> 19:11.319
didn't feature
any of The Beach Boys.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.087
It was Brian Wilson's decision
to push the music

19:14.087 --> 19:16.217
to another level.
And to do that,

19:16.222 --> 19:18.362
he enlisted the best of L.A.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.128
We were on the road
150 days a year.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.587
Brian was getting a little bit
more complex

19:22.595 --> 19:27.165
in his arrangements. And
it just got to be too difficult

19:27.167 --> 19:30.467
to-- to coordinate
our itineraries.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.040
And that's when
The Wrecking Crew stepped in.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.369
When I heard that
some of the guys sat in

19:35.375 --> 19:38.335
for some of The Beach Boys,
that surprised me.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.244
But in truth, at that point,

19:40.246 --> 19:41.946
The Beach Boys were
Brian Wilson.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.448
He created it all.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.619
He was very self-assured,
very much in control.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.318
He brought in the charts
that he wrote himself.

19:48.321 --> 19:53.291
And most of the time, I mean,
the music was entirely his.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.433
I mean, there were
very few times that we made up

19:55.428 --> 19:57.898
- licks on his stuff. Yeah.
- ...musically correct.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.897
He had in his head
what he wanted.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.169
First album,
it was--

20:02.168 --> 20:03.298
<i> Summer Days
 ,</i>

20:03.303 --> 20:04.743
The Beach Boy album.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.407
Ray Pohlman was a great
bass player, really good.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.167
Steve Douglas was,
like, so on-the-mark

20:10.176 --> 20:13.736
as a saxophone player.
He just blew my mind.

20:13.746 --> 20:17.176
He played with such finesse,
you know?

20:17.183 --> 20:19.283
And he used to get real close
to the microphone

20:19.285 --> 20:21.715
to get the best benefit
of his instrument.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.691
They were all-- The Wrecking
Crew-- They were just great.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.899
Brian was a genius.
I mean, he would just--

20:40.473 --> 20:43.343
He was just good
as I've ever seen, I believe,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.683
about putting things
together.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.108
Western studio,
and there was probably...

20:49.115 --> 20:51.975
fifteen, 20 guys in that studio.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.415
He'd start at the first guy...

20:54.420 --> 20:56.050
and he'd sing 'em their part
until they got it,

20:56.055 --> 20:57.685
and second guy,
he'd sing their part,

20:57.690 --> 21:00.490
and the third guy,
all the way around the room.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.833
Then he'd go back
to the first guy.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.998
Well, the first guy
had forgot his part

21:03.997 --> 21:06.457
and he'd sing it again,
sang a second--

21:06.466 --> 21:08.396
He taught the whole thing
by rote.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.731
And all of a sudden,
that whole band

21:09.736 --> 21:14.536
could play that shit.
I mean, Brian is--

21:14.540 --> 21:16.770
When you want to talk
about genius,

21:16.776 --> 21:20.406
he's-- There's not any more
like him that I know of.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.583
I mean, he's unbelievable.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.382
<i> Pet Sounds was
an incredibly important record,</i>

21:26.386 --> 21:30.756
and still stands there, like,
"Okay, top this," you know?

21:30.757 --> 21:35.187
<i>George Martin told me
 Sgt. Pepper was an attempt--</i>

21:35.194 --> 21:37.634
<i>It was an attempt
to equal Pet Sounds.</i>

21:37.630 --> 21:41.500
So it was an incredibly
influential record

21:41.501 --> 21:43.931
and I think it had
an electromagnetic field.

21:43.936 --> 21:48.266
And people were drawn here,
and wanted to be a part of that,

21:48.274 --> 21:50.044
and wanted to make records
like that.

21:50.043 --> 21:53.413
<i> Good Vibrations, we must have
done 25, 30 sessions.</i>

21:53.413 --> 21:55.053
It might take
six months to do.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.678
Some days,
we worked five minutes.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.553
- Some days, four hours.
- Yeah.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.892
- On the same song.
- We just-- We experimented.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.548
And they would ask me,
"Well, what do you want?"

22:03.556 --> 22:05.356
And I'd say, "well,
I don't know," you know?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.958
and we'd go home, and
the next time we get together,

22:06.959 --> 22:09.189
then we would fall together,
and we'd do the thing.

22:09.195 --> 22:12.755
Three months,
two, three dates a week,

22:12.765 --> 22:15.095
but Capitol Records
was picking up the tab.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.671
<i> And we liked
 to work for him.</i>

22:16.669 --> 22:18.299
The word was,
"Do you have the date

22:18.304 --> 22:19.604
with Brian Wilson
tomorrow?"

22:19.605 --> 22:21.165
I'd say, "Yeah, I do."
"Oh, good."

22:21.174 --> 22:23.244
<i>Well, Carol played
on Good Vibrations</i>

22:23.242 --> 22:26.112
<i>and California Girls,
and she was, like,</i>

22:26.112 --> 22:27.412
the star of the show.
I mean, she was

22:27.413 --> 22:29.653
the greatest bass player
in the world.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.349
And she was
way ahead of her time.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.151
She would play
a tonic in a fifth

22:33.152 --> 22:35.452
or a third instead of a fifth,
you know.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.545
She was one
of the first bass players

22:36.556 --> 22:38.186
to start playing that way.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.931
But he definitely wrote out
some neat lines on the bass,

22:40.927 --> 22:42.427
like, for instance:

22:44.097 --> 22:45.357
I'd never played that.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.001
I'll just go into this...

22:59.112 --> 23:01.152
Now, that's
a jazz walking line.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.747
You knew that this kid was into
something really, really great.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.021
The room had a spirit to it,
with Hal being the leader,

23:08.020 --> 23:09.420
you know,
and all the guys

23:09.422 --> 23:10.922
working together,
and thumping and pumping.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.323
<i> He would get things
 like he wanted to hear them.</i>

23:13.326 --> 23:15.656
And when he got 'em that way,
it was good.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.361
<i>When I heard G ood Vibrations
the first time on the radio,</i>

23:18.364 --> 23:19.934
I just--
It just blew me away.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.289
<i> Now.</i>

23:49.295 --> 23:50.925
<i> Very good.</i>

23:50.930 --> 23:52.960
I remember Carol though.
I still have to remember,

23:52.965 --> 23:55.965
'cause your favorite thing,
no matter what day we went on

23:55.968 --> 23:59.338
after that, "Would you like me
to use my Beach Boy pick?"

23:59.338 --> 24:00.698
And so she'd

24:00.706 --> 24:02.966
impress the shit out of--
This one, and--

24:02.975 --> 24:04.575
She picked it up
on her way to the studio.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.037
And they're looking
at this pick,

24:06.045 --> 24:08.005
- and they're looking at her.
- You have to sell it,

24:08.014 --> 24:09.554
- you know.
- She was selling this shit

24:09.549 --> 24:12.179
like I couldn't believe.
One little pick made this girl

24:12.185 --> 24:13.545
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.669
I was very jealous
of the guitar

24:29.669 --> 24:31.939
when we were first dating
and got engaged,

24:31.938 --> 24:36.068
and he paid a lot more
attention to the guitar, I felt.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.635
So I gave him an ultimatum,
"It's me or the guitar."

24:39.645 --> 24:43.905
And he said, "Honey,
the guitar doesn't have legs.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.416
you do."

24:45.418 --> 24:47.618
I got so upset with him,
I took my ring

24:47.620 --> 24:50.550
and I threw it at him.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.016
Then I went looking for it.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.924
And I was one of these
late starters in life.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.686
I wasn't one of these guys that
you read about in the books.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.356
You know, you read
these articles

24:58.364 --> 24:59.564
<i>in Guitar Player magazine,
the guy says,</i>

24:59.565 --> 25:01.265
"Well, when I was
12 years old,

25:01.267 --> 25:03.967
I had the chops of a reindeer
and all this stuff, you know."

25:05.872 --> 25:08.472
When I was 12 years old,
I was playing marbles myself,

25:08.474 --> 25:10.844
I don't know, you know.
And when I was 24,

25:10.843 --> 25:13.083
I was at Douglas Aircraft,
you know, moving boxes

25:13.079 --> 25:15.379
- and trying to play guitar.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.881
I was 24,
I was still into this.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.784
"Wow, I'm in seventh position."

25:20.786 --> 25:22.686
And I finally learned
one hip chord.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.088
- Whoa.

25:25.091 --> 25:29.461
So I'm not one of them guys
you read about.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.962
We went to the prom,
and Ralph Marterie

25:31.964 --> 25:34.134
was playing the dance.
We found out

25:34.133 --> 25:37.373
that their guitar player
was leaving that night.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.770
And he tried out,
auditioned,

25:39.772 --> 25:41.972
and he was hired
right then and there.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.174
It was on a Friday night,
and the Saturday night,

25:44.176 --> 25:45.576
he left for New York city.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.958
<i> Tell the truth.
- Okay, you got to let go.</i>

26:02.795 --> 26:07.525
Marterie was going to get
a guitar/singer,

26:07.533 --> 26:11.003
so that he could only pay
for one guy.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.443
He decided he knew
there was nothing there

26:13.439 --> 26:15.539
in Niagara Falls for him.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.611
He wanted to go
to California to play.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.211
While my father struggled
to find work playing guitar,

26:21.213 --> 26:23.883
he had to make ends meet
working in a warehouse.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.583
He always said it was
the best job he ever had.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.686
He hated it so much,
it made him practice every day.

26:29.689 --> 26:34.529
I was told by two guys
before we left,

26:34.527 --> 26:36.687
"He's never gonna make it."

26:36.696 --> 26:38.996
So after seven months
of struggling here,

26:38.998 --> 26:42.928
daddy wanted to go back,
and I said, "There's no way,"

26:42.935 --> 26:45.495
because I wasn't giving in
to those two guys.

26:47.073 --> 26:50.713
And that's why dad said,
"My stubborn Sicilian wife."

26:50.710 --> 26:54.680
In fact,
my wife was behind me 100%,

26:54.680 --> 26:57.350
like, all the time I work.
And she's-- It was "You tour."

26:57.350 --> 26:59.220
She was working,
she took the calls,

26:59.218 --> 27:00.748
she didn't-- never complained.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.353
I would come in
at 11:00 or 10:00,

27:03.356 --> 27:04.956
I'd see my kids whenever.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.657
My wife accepted it,
this was our living,

27:07.660 --> 27:10.030
our whole family took it
exactly that way.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.799
Every once in a while,
a musician's wife

27:11.797 --> 27:13.557
would come
and complain to her,

27:13.566 --> 27:15.296
and she'd talk to them.
She'd say,

27:15.301 --> 27:16.871
"Well, look,
that's his living."

27:16.869 --> 27:19.669
Well, Carmie never talked
to Barbara the Barbarian.

27:19.672 --> 27:22.572
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

27:22.575 --> 27:24.575
My father would say,
"There are only four reasons

27:24.577 --> 27:25.977
to take a gig:

27:25.978 --> 27:28.448
for the money,
for the connections,

27:28.447 --> 27:30.947
for the experience,
or just for fun."

27:30.950 --> 27:33.580
I got to tell you a story
about your dad.

27:33.586 --> 27:35.716
We were in Western studio
three there,

27:35.721 --> 27:38.621
and, uh, Jan Berry
of Jan and Dean,

27:38.624 --> 27:40.824
he counted the song,
"Everybody ready? Yeah. Okay."

27:40.826 --> 27:46.396
Tedesco started playing,

27:46.399 --> 27:49.129
and Jan says, "Stop, wait."
And he went over and looked,

27:49.135 --> 27:51.165
and he said, "Tedesco,
what are you doing?"

27:51.170 --> 27:52.440
He-- Tommy--

27:52.438 --> 27:53.698
The music was upside down,

27:53.706 --> 27:55.636
and Tommy was
reading it backwards.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.041
Now, that's a true story,

27:57.043 --> 27:59.243
but you talk about
getting a laugh out of it.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.735
Tommy was a cut-up.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.558
Hold it, cut it.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.131
<i> There was an energy
 that Phillip would get.</i>

28:21.133 --> 28:25.243
<i> I remember, Phillip would be
so excited about every session.</i>

28:25.237 --> 28:29.067
There was just a vitality
in the room that was--

28:29.075 --> 28:30.705
would lift you
off of your feet.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.140
<i> And also there'd be
 so many players</i>

28:32.144 --> 28:34.114
<i> and the sound would be
 so huge.</i>

28:34.113 --> 28:37.723
I mean, it was definitely--
That wall of sound was really--

28:37.717 --> 28:38.777
It was really there.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.024
<i> I never was in the studio</i>

28:40.019 --> 28:41.919
<i> that there were
 any different guys.</i>

28:41.921 --> 28:43.521
it was the same guys always.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.506
The "wall of sound" was
the Gold Star echo chambers,

29:03.509 --> 29:04.939
- mainly.
- Well, it was wall-to-wall

29:04.944 --> 29:06.814
- musicians first of all.
- Yeah, that's true.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.682
Most people'd use
a four-piece rhythm section.

29:09.682 --> 29:13.022
He had four guitars,
or six, or seven.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.748
There were four pianos always,

29:14.754 --> 29:17.964
one upright bass,
one fender bass.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.657
I mean, it was only
one drums, usually.

29:20.659 --> 29:23.529
Fifteen people playing
percussion instruments.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.129
- In a very small room.
- Yeah.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.661
Not a small room,
but an average room.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.225
And a huge echo chamber
that Gold Star

29:29.235 --> 29:31.465
was famous for,
that was the wall of sound.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.700
Ceramic walls.

29:32.705 --> 29:34.765
- One, two, three.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.754
- Good.
- The wall of sound

29:43.749 --> 29:46.849
of Phil Spector's
more like a lost feeling.

29:46.852 --> 29:49.922
<i>it's heavy on You've Lost
 That Lovin' Feelin',</i>

29:49.922 --> 29:52.792
and it was--
He used the echo so much,

29:52.792 --> 29:54.692
and it was swimming
all the time.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.763
In spite of the baffles,
we all leaked

29:56.762 --> 29:59.532
into each other's mics,
just enough to give it

29:59.532 --> 30:03.832
the combination of leakage
and echo, plus we were tired.

30:03.836 --> 30:06.036
By the 30th take,
you're tired, you know.

30:06.038 --> 30:10.038
So it had a real
relaxed feeling on his hits.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.487
It's the most played song
of all time.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.690
Oh, I believe it, yeah.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.591
Most played record
of all time.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.063
<i> They were the whole sound
 that Phillip had.</i>

30:30.062 --> 30:31.962
<i> Phillip was also
 really, really superstitious,</i>

30:31.964 --> 30:33.464
<i> and he didn't--
 He wanted those guys,</i>

30:33.465 --> 30:35.425
<i> and he always wanted
 those guys, you know?</i>

30:35.434 --> 30:39.204
He felt only secure when
he was playing with those guys.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.905
Same musicians,
same engineers, same studio,

30:41.907 --> 30:44.467
same, probably, brand of tape.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.106
Yeah, probably.
- Um...

30:47.112 --> 30:50.352
It was just a thing
that he figured if he didn't

30:50.349 --> 30:53.349
do it that way,
it wouldn't be a hit.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.792
- And he was probably right.
- He was probably right.

30:55.788 --> 30:58.288
And we're grateful for that.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.020
G-minor seventh.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.985
You know, Phillip was walking
in a different universe

31:01.994 --> 31:05.304
than everybody else. And so
in his mind, it was all him,

31:05.297 --> 31:07.157
you know, and the guys
were just some sort of

31:07.166 --> 31:09.666
an extension
of what he couldn't do.

31:09.668 --> 31:13.398
Phil would never
record anything

31:13.405 --> 31:14.935
for the first three hours.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.140
I mean,
he worked these guys

31:16.141 --> 31:18.911
so that they
weren't playing

31:18.911 --> 31:21.981
individualistic.
They were too tired.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.351
And so they just
melded into this--

31:25.351 --> 31:27.181
this wall of sound.

31:27.186 --> 31:30.246
Phil leaned on Howard
very, very heavy

31:30.256 --> 31:34.656
about how to play, and just kept
on it, and on it, and on it.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.260
And wasn't satisfied
or something,

31:36.262 --> 31:39.362
and made 'em kept playing over,
and over, and over,

31:39.365 --> 31:41.095
and over again for hours

31:41.100 --> 31:45.940
until Howard's hands
were just a mass of pain.

31:45.938 --> 31:49.068
"No, no, no, no, this way."
Howard says, "Look, man,

31:49.074 --> 31:52.544
"if I can't play it,
and you know what it is,

31:52.544 --> 31:53.984
why don't you play it?"

31:53.979 --> 31:56.549
Howard Robert's the only guy
that I ever saw

31:56.548 --> 31:58.878
walk out of a session,

31:58.884 --> 32:01.254
where he just
put everything down,

32:01.253 --> 32:04.053
picked up his guitar
and his amp,

32:04.056 --> 32:06.316
and he walked out. He said,
"I've had enough of this."

32:06.325 --> 32:09.255
He was very demanding.
I had no problem with Phil.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.931
I guess it's because
he knew that I always knew

32:11.931 --> 32:13.861
that I wasn't
the original drummer,

32:13.866 --> 32:15.726
'cause if I'd have had
a problem, I'd walked out.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.234
Who was he gonna get?

32:17.236 --> 32:19.366
He'd already, you know,
had his argument with Al,

32:19.371 --> 32:20.971
maybe Al wouldn't have
came back.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.413
So-- So, we got along fine.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.780
<i> They made fun of him
 all the time,</i>

32:25.778 --> 32:27.008
<i> but they really liked him.</i>

32:27.012 --> 32:28.552
I think they really
respected him.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.407
They thought he was nuts,
which, of course, he was,

32:30.416 --> 32:32.446
but I think they always
looked forward to it

32:32.451 --> 32:35.121
because it was always gonna be
something really cool.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.750
<i> It was like
 a total thing friendship too,</i>

32:36.755 --> 32:38.655
<i> 'cause they would come in
and they would be talking about,</i>

32:38.657 --> 32:40.387
<i> you know, "What'd you do
 on the golf course?"</i>

32:40.392 --> 32:42.832
<i> or, you know, that someone
 had this car or so--</i>

32:42.828 --> 32:44.358
<i> There was always
 a Mad magazine too,</i>

32:44.363 --> 32:46.863
<i> being passed around that
 somebody brought, you know.</i>

32:48.367 --> 32:50.427
<i> I was in awe of them
because of Phil Spector, that--</i>

32:50.436 --> 32:51.966
<i> It took me a couple times
 to get used to,</i>

32:51.971 --> 32:53.701
<i> you know, being with the guys,
 you know.</i>

32:53.706 --> 32:55.536
<i>Any memories of Be My Baby
the first time you heard it?</i>

32:55.541 --> 32:58.311
Oh, I pulled my car
over to the side of the road,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.540
said, "What am I
listening to here," you know?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.146
I couldn't believe it.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.947
<i>I instantly wrote
 Don't Worry Baby</i>

33:03.949 --> 33:05.419
after I heard that. Yeah.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.117
I was so inspired.
I couldn't believe it.

33:45.991 --> 33:49.031
<i>By the time we got
to River deep - Mountain High,</i>

33:49.028 --> 33:51.128
we all thought that was gonna be
a giant of a hit.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.760
It was another
wall of sound hit,

33:53.766 --> 33:55.396
but it flopped.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.771
It was a big hit in the U.K.,
but in the USA,

33:58.771 --> 34:00.571
it was his first downer.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.112
And it was like, "Okay,
that style is going then.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.279
The wall of sound
was over then."

34:08.580 --> 34:11.110
<i> One of the boys.
 One of the boys.</i>

34:11.116 --> 34:12.476
<i>One of the guys, yeah.</i>

34:12.484 --> 34:14.654
If sexual harassment suits
were in there, she'd be

34:14.652 --> 34:17.223
- seven millionaires right now,

34:17.222 --> 34:18.722
...after what we put
her through.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.994
She'd have all the lawyers
working for-- Against us.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.327
I don't think anyone
ever really felt

34:24.329 --> 34:26.759
that she was a woman-woman, and
I don't mean that detrimentally.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.165
- No, we were musicians.
- Yeah.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.098
Everything was music--
music, really.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.273
- Yeah.
- Worse than that

34:32.271 --> 34:35.011
would have been...
shutting her out

34:35.007 --> 34:37.067
and not sharing the camaraderie.

34:37.076 --> 34:43.806
<i>Impossible
theme song)</i>

34:48.619 --> 34:50.889
And this is the only one
I had to really palm mute

34:50.889 --> 34:52.489
to get the treble out.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.656
So you can hear that.
Yeah.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.432
Anyway, that's what I did, yeah.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.160
And it's Earl Palmer
on drums on that one.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.466
<i> I heard music as a kid</i>

35:03.469 --> 35:05.839
<i> because my mother was
 a professional piano player.</i>

35:05.838 --> 35:08.438
She'd play in the back
of the silent movie houses.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.370
And my dad was
a trombone player.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.935
He played Dixieland bands,
things like that.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.535
So I heard music all the time.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.446
If they didn't fight,
they played music,

35:16.448 --> 35:18.778
so you know-- you knew
where it was coming from.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.719
<i> My mom and I were living
 in this housing project.</i>

35:23.722 --> 35:25.322
But my mom saved up her pennies

35:25.324 --> 35:27.524
<i> and there was a steel guitar
 salesman that came around.</i>

35:27.526 --> 35:30.686
And about three or four lessons
for ten bucks,

35:30.696 --> 35:33.826
so she opted for that.
And I was about 13 then.

35:33.832 --> 35:37.502
About that time, I started
playing gigs on guitar.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.665
And little Latin things.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.073
<i> So it was a lot
of great experience, you know...</i>

35:47.946 --> 35:50.006
...that kind of stuff,
heavy-duty jazz.

35:50.015 --> 35:52.145
<i> And it was fun,
 and I was playing</i>

35:52.151 --> 35:53.451
<i> a lot in the black clubs.</i>

35:53.452 --> 35:55.252
<i> And very accepted too,
 by the way.</i>

35:55.254 --> 35:57.094
<i> I had made a name for myself.</i>

35:57.089 --> 35:59.459
There were a lot of women around
that played jazz

35:59.458 --> 36:01.688
and were in pop bands
of their own,

36:01.693 --> 36:03.333
so it wasn't that unusual.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.298
<i> But most women
back in those days, in the '50s,</i>

36:06.298 --> 36:08.568
<i> would play
 until they got married.</i>

36:08.567 --> 36:12.767
it was more important to have
a "Mrs." in front of your name

36:12.771 --> 36:14.271
than it was to have a career.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.386
Then the chance came
to do studio work

36:29.388 --> 36:31.888
in late 1957 for Sam Cooke.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.120
And I'd never heard
of Sam Cooke,

36:33.125 --> 36:34.715
but they were short
a guitar player.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.556
As soon as I did
my first date with Sam Cooke,

36:37.563 --> 36:40.403
I got more money
in three hours' work than I did

36:40.399 --> 36:42.529
in a whole week's work
of my day job.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.704
Except they've got
more than two dates a week.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.573
They wanted
our particular group of people

36:47.573 --> 36:53.183
to cut the hit records,
because we got good at it.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.308
<i> Ray Pohlman had a great sound.</i>

36:56.315 --> 36:58.945
<i> He was the very first
 electric bass player</i>

36:58.951 --> 37:00.881
<i>playing hits from about '57 on.</i>

37:00.886 --> 37:04.286
<i> I'd say that he did maybe
 85% of the hit records.</i>

37:04.289 --> 37:07.159
But Ray Pohlman got to be
the musical conductor

37:07.159 --> 37:08.789
<i>for the Shindig show
about the same time</i>

37:08.794 --> 37:13.204
I accidentally got on bass,
so there was a big hole there.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.298
<i> People ask me all the time
 about being a woman</i>

37:15.300 --> 37:16.630
<i> in a man's world.</i>

37:16.635 --> 37:18.795
<i> I felt equal
 with the rest of the guys,</i>

37:18.804 --> 37:20.004
<i> and they felt it too.</i>

37:20.005 --> 37:21.765
<i> Sometimes they got
 a little testy.</i>

37:21.773 --> 37:23.743
<i> They'd say, "Oh, you play good
 for a girl, Carol."</i>

37:23.742 --> 37:25.582
<i> "Yeah, you play good
 for a guy too."</i>

37:25.577 --> 37:28.277
I love musicians
and the humor

37:28.280 --> 37:30.580
and the way that they play.
And they all knew that.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.682
And I think
it was like a sister--

37:32.684 --> 37:34.654
having a sister there.

37:34.653 --> 37:39.223
<i> I had my two kids and my mom
 to support by that time.</i>

37:39.224 --> 37:40.894
We would do
three, four dates a day,

37:40.892 --> 37:44.462
and I'd manage to get home
to have dinner with the kids.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.333
That's the only thing I regret,
is that I didn't

37:46.331 --> 37:47.731
spend more time with the kids.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.973
But they were
very well taken care of,

37:50.969 --> 37:52.869
and they had good lives,
you know.

37:52.871 --> 37:57.141
Most of-- most of the time,
they were fine.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.484
You know, after looking
at my father's work logs,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.810
I came to realize
he wasn't around

38:03.815 --> 38:05.845
as much as I thought he was.

38:05.851 --> 38:09.851
But when he was home,
his focus was on his family.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.768
He was one of the few
studio guys

38:22.768 --> 38:25.198
who found a balance
between working crazy hours

38:25.203 --> 38:27.903
and maintaining
a pretty decent home life.

38:27.906 --> 38:34.906
The truth is,
I don't know how he did it.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.750
Time was money,
and you wouldn't last long

38:38.750 --> 38:44.150
in any studio
if you couldn't keep up.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.616
The studio musicians
in this town

38:45.624 --> 38:48.464
were really looked up to
and respected.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.530
We were treated like...

38:50.529 --> 38:52.259
"Our life depends on you guys."

38:52.264 --> 38:53.634
Well, they were
real session players.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.602
They were guys that were going
from gig to gig,

38:55.600 --> 38:57.730
you know, playing
on all the good music.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.436
Gosh, there were
so many things went on

39:00.439 --> 39:02.369
and we were so busy.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.814
I mean, we would go from one
to the other to the other.

39:04.810 --> 39:09.910
We used to call
going from session to session

39:09.915 --> 39:11.045
"dovetailing."

39:11.049 --> 39:12.279
Jesus,
when you leave the house

39:12.284 --> 39:13.654
at 7:00 in the morning,

39:13.652 --> 39:15.752
and you're at Universal
at 9:00 till noon.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.954
Now you're at Capitol Records
at 1:00,

39:17.956 --> 39:19.616
you just got time to get there,

39:19.624 --> 39:21.864
and then you got a jingle
at 4:00,

39:21.860 --> 39:25.600
and then we were on a date
with somebody at 8:00,

39:25.597 --> 39:27.397
and then The Beach Boys
at midnight,

39:27.399 --> 39:29.369
and you do that
five days a week...

39:29.368 --> 39:31.098
Jeez, man, you get burned out.

39:31.103 --> 39:32.643
At one time,
we did an album

39:32.637 --> 39:34.837
in a day,
for Liberty Records.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.380
Five, six weeks in a row,
we'd do an album a day--

39:38.377 --> 39:41.077
six tunes in the morning
and six tunes in the evening.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.779
When all the guys realized

39:42.781 --> 39:44.781
that we were doing
most of the dates, said,

39:44.783 --> 39:48.223
"We'll get scale,
or you'll get somebody else."

39:48.220 --> 39:50.350
And, course, they didn't,

39:50.355 --> 39:52.615
'cause that was
the tightest rhythm section

39:52.624 --> 39:54.324
I believe I've ever played with.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.901
I would not go
in a studio

40:40.906 --> 40:45.436
if I didn't have Tommy Tedesco,
Hal Blaine,

40:45.444 --> 40:47.114
people of that nature.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.152
<i>I just wouldn't go into a studio
 until they weren't busy.</i>

40:50.148 --> 40:51.778
<i>But they were busy all the time.</i>

40:51.783 --> 40:53.423
No matter which producer
I worked with,

40:53.418 --> 40:56.148
whether it was Lee Hazlewood
or Snuff Garrett,

40:56.154 --> 40:57.794
they all used
the same musicians.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.119
<i> They were all just the best.</i>

41:00.125 --> 41:02.785
If they couldn't get the guys,
they didn't book the date.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.404
They'd wait
until the guys were available.

41:05.397 --> 41:06.727
Which was wonderful.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.771
Of course, their wives
never saw them.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.269
I don't know how those guys
could've worked any more,

41:13.271 --> 41:16.541
unless they didn't sleep at all.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.811
If you want to be successful
in this business,

41:18.810 --> 41:21.580
you never say no until
you're too busy to say yes.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.810
<i> And I learned that
 by watching guys</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:26.445
<i> who talked themselves
 out of careers</i>

41:26.451 --> 41:28.851
by saying,
"No, it's not good enough.

41:28.854 --> 41:31.124
<i> I'm gonna wait till
 such-and-such and so-and-so."</i>

41:31.122 --> 41:34.192
Because if you wait at home
for the phone to ring, it won't.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.132
If you're
a freelance musician,

41:36.127 --> 41:38.057
you can't turn nothing down,

41:38.063 --> 41:40.433
because there's somebody
standing right behind you

41:40.432 --> 41:43.402
who is salivating
to do this work.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.601
One day, I get a call
from Ernie Freeman.

41:45.604 --> 41:46.944
It was, like,
8:00 in the morning.

41:46.938 --> 41:50.708
"Hi, Tom, I need
a guitar player here at United.

41:50.709 --> 41:51.939
How long will it take you
to get there?"

41:51.943 --> 41:53.513
I said, "20 minutes,"
which, you know,

41:53.512 --> 41:54.812
is a lie.
It's gonna take an hour.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.813
But once I made
my commitment, they've got

41:56.815 --> 41:58.105
- to wait for me, right?
- That's right.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.776
When I go up there,
I did my date, and he loved it.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.445
And then he tells me,
"You won't believe

42:02.454 --> 42:03.554
what Bill Pitman said.

42:03.555 --> 42:05.455
"I called bill and asked him,

42:05.457 --> 42:06.757
'Can you come down?
I'm stuck.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.588
How long will it be?'
And Bill says,

42:08.593 --> 42:10.863
'Well, I'm having breakfast.
I should be finished

42:10.862 --> 42:15.432
in about 45 minutes,
and I'll be there in an hour.'"

42:15.433 --> 42:18.503
And if anybody ever
figured Bill Pitman out,

42:18.503 --> 42:22.143
that was a Bill Pitman--
straight life, not thinking.

42:22.140 --> 42:26.380
And I'm the opposite, like,
"What will work right now?"

42:26.378 --> 42:27.738
<i> Now it's time
 for another take</i>

42:27.746 --> 42:29.946
<i> of what probably will be
 another smash hit</i>

42:29.948 --> 42:32.618
<i> in the wondrous world
 of Sonny and Cher.</i>

42:32.617 --> 42:35.177
<i> Sonny himself writes
 most of the songs</i>

42:35.186 --> 42:36.986
<i> he and Cher record.</i>

42:36.988 --> 42:38.788
<i> Musicians often work
 with the couple,</i>

42:38.790 --> 42:42.090
<i> and they're excellent
 sight readers.</i>

42:42.093 --> 42:44.893
<i> Today, they're recording
 several songs</i>

42:44.896 --> 42:46.626
<i> that will be part
 of an album called</i>

42:46.631 --> 42:49.501
The Wondrous World
of Sonny & Cher,

42:49.501 --> 42:52.271
<i> the second album
 they've made together.</i>

42:52.270 --> 42:55.200
<i> Now they're ready to record.</i>

42:55.206 --> 42:57.206
<i> The engineer is set...</i>

42:57.208 --> 42:59.508
<i> and they call, "Take one."</i>

42:59.511 --> 43:01.311
Were you ever intimidated
by the guys?

43:01.313 --> 43:02.813
No, I was too stupid to know.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.114
<i> Well, I was kind of shy
 of everybody.</i>

43:05.116 --> 43:06.846
First of all, they were
a lot older than me too.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.381
I mean, the first time--
session I went to,

43:08.386 --> 43:10.416
I was 16 years old,
and I didn't--

43:10.422 --> 43:11.962
I'd never been
inside a recording studio.

43:11.957 --> 43:13.487
<i> You know, I just didn't want
 to step</i>

43:13.491 --> 43:14.761
<i> any place I wasn't
 supposed to step,</i>

43:14.759 --> 43:16.359
<i>which I thought was everywhere.</i>

43:16.361 --> 43:18.361
<i> And they all knew each other,
 they were really relaxed.</i>

43:18.363 --> 43:19.763
<i> I mean, everybody
 was nice to me.</i>

43:19.764 --> 43:22.374
I really don't think I knew
for a long time

43:22.367 --> 43:23.797
just how great they were.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.872
And then later,
when I would meet other players

43:26.871 --> 43:28.641
who would ask me, you know,
did I--

43:28.640 --> 43:33.940
Was I ever on a session
with any of these guys?

43:33.945 --> 43:36.575
There was a lot of honesty
in those records

43:36.581 --> 43:38.251
and that's why
a lot of 'em were hits.

43:38.249 --> 43:41.449
When I thought of the music,
I thought I was a 13-year-old

43:41.453 --> 43:43.523
trying to learn
how to play music.

43:43.521 --> 43:44.951
Every time I'd play.
You know,

43:44.956 --> 43:46.186
there was all them hits
that was on--

43:46.191 --> 43:49.131
The Marketts, Routers,
all them solos. And then,

43:49.127 --> 43:50.987
- I brought myself back.
- Tongue in cheek.

43:50.996 --> 43:53.256
I said,
"How would a kid play this,

43:53.264 --> 43:55.734
that's so stupid, that
doesn't know what he's doing,

43:55.734 --> 43:57.834
and play that?"
I did that shit,

43:57.836 --> 43:59.796
didn't know what I was doing,
bending notes,

43:59.804 --> 44:02.314
didn't care, didn't--
Awful, out of tune.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.667
- Yeah.
- What is this tune?

44:03.675 --> 44:05.235
- Beatles? Cockroaches?
- Some young group.

44:05.243 --> 44:06.513
- I had no idea.
- Cockroaches.

44:06.511 --> 44:07.841
I didn't know
them kind of names then.

44:07.846 --> 44:10.246
Well, my personal feeling
about the music

44:10.248 --> 44:11.708
was that it was all wonderful

44:11.716 --> 44:14.276
and I was making
millions of dollars...

44:14.285 --> 44:15.845
period.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.654
<i> I didn't give a damn
 if Tommy liked it or not.</i>

44:17.656 --> 44:19.086
<i> I didn't make it for him.</i>

44:19.090 --> 44:20.360
<i> Like the artist.</i>

44:20.358 --> 44:21.688
Cher said she didn't like it.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.263
Well, I didn't make it
for her anyway.

44:23.261 --> 44:24.291
I made it for people to buy,

44:24.295 --> 44:26.095
not for Cher to listen to.

44:26.097 --> 44:28.127
<i>She never listened
to Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves</i>

44:28.133 --> 44:32.573
or any other record
I made with her... again.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.400
<i> It was Diamond Ring.</i>

44:34.406 --> 44:35.666
We cut that record,
and I said,

44:35.674 --> 44:38.044
"Oh, my God. I hate this shit."

44:38.043 --> 44:41.783
Two weeks later,
it was number ten or something.

44:41.780 --> 44:45.350
So I have to give it to Snuff
in terms of

44:45.350 --> 44:48.220
a certain kind of pop awareness.

44:48.219 --> 44:52.459
He had it, but it was not
exactly my cup of tea.

44:52.457 --> 44:55.157
The music that we cut
in the '60s,

44:55.160 --> 44:58.730
nobody thought that was gonna
last, like, past ten years.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.060
In fact, Bill Pitman says--

45:00.065 --> 45:02.765
We were doing a
chugga-chugga-chugga date,

45:02.767 --> 45:05.197
he says,
"Can you see the kids

45:05.203 --> 45:07.203
dancing with their wives
20 years from now,

45:07.205 --> 45:09.265
saying, 'Darling,
they're playing our song'?"

45:09.274 --> 45:11.914
I remember coming home
from a session one day,

45:11.910 --> 45:14.740
and it was just one
of those three-chord sessions.

45:14.746 --> 45:16.576
And when you're sitting there
playing rhythm guitar,

45:16.581 --> 45:17.951
there's not much you can do.

45:17.949 --> 45:19.579
You just do it, get your money
and go home.

45:19.584 --> 45:21.924
And I remember coming home,
and I was not in a good mood.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.790
I said to my wife, "I could do
this when I was 14 years old."

45:25.790 --> 45:28.760
And she said, "Yeah,
but not nearly as well."

45:28.760 --> 45:30.990
I didn't care
for rock and roll that much.

45:30.995 --> 45:33.055
I was basically
a jazz drummer.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.134
But I realized that I'm
making my living off of it.

45:35.133 --> 45:36.873
If I'm gonna continue
to do that,

45:36.868 --> 45:38.938
I got to play that
like that's my favorite music.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.167
<i> That's not professionalism
 to me.</i>

45:41.172 --> 45:43.712
<i> It's not beneath you
 if it's supporting you.</i>

45:43.708 --> 45:45.938
<i> If it's beneath you,
 don't play it.</i>

45:45.944 --> 45:47.914
I actually enjoyed it,

45:47.912 --> 45:49.982
because when I heard the records
on the radio,

45:49.981 --> 45:52.351
I realized, really,
what an incredible sound

45:52.350 --> 45:55.080
that group of people had.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.096
We're going
up to Capitol Records

46:46.104 --> 46:48.104
- right up here.
- Oh, right.

46:48.106 --> 46:50.266
God, the streets
are so friggin' torn up,

46:50.275 --> 46:51.535
it's unbelievable.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.143
This is where
we used to do all of,

46:53.144 --> 46:54.884
you know,
Glen Campbell's records

46:54.879 --> 46:58.479
and Ray Anthony
and everybody, man.

46:58.483 --> 47:01.253
Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.722
We did everyone
down in the bowels.

47:03.721 --> 47:05.791
Pretty amazing.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.160
As soon as we got
in those studios

47:07.158 --> 47:09.188
and we found out
that this made a lot of bucks,

47:09.194 --> 47:11.864
it was like, "Hey, man,
we don't have to go on the road.

47:11.863 --> 47:13.603
We can stay home
with our kids," you know.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.358
Unfortunately, I didn't.

47:15.366 --> 47:17.226
I went through six wives.

47:18.870 --> 47:21.640
Yeah, but that was 'cause
of your personality...

47:21.639 --> 47:23.309
...not your playing.

47:23.308 --> 47:27.308
No, I had two major marriages,
and they both fell apart

47:27.312 --> 47:29.882
because I was in the studio
too much.

47:29.881 --> 47:31.411
I think
it's a very hard balance.

47:31.416 --> 47:32.746
Yeah, it was tough.

47:34.619 --> 47:37.119
<i> When I got out of the army,
 I took my G.I. bill,</i>

47:37.121 --> 47:40.221
<i> went to Chicago,
went to a percussion institute.</i>

47:40.225 --> 47:42.525
I was going to school
from about 8:00 in the morning

47:42.527 --> 47:47.227
to 4:00 in the afternoon. And
then I was playing strip clubs

47:47.232 --> 47:50.472
from about 8:00 at night to
4:00 in the morning,

47:50.468 --> 47:52.098
which was pretty wild.

47:52.103 --> 47:55.943
But it was great
sight reading training.

47:55.940 --> 47:59.110
You got all these new women
coming and dancing,

47:59.110 --> 48:01.140
throwing this music at you,

48:01.145 --> 48:04.605
and you got to, you know,
read it immediately.

48:11.890 --> 48:16.260
It was great training
to relax you and to play,

48:16.261 --> 48:18.431
because to this day,
I could sit down,

48:18.429 --> 48:20.799
you can throw any kind of music
in front of me,

48:20.798 --> 48:22.628
and I will--
You know, it might be

48:22.634 --> 48:25.844
the hardest thing in the world,
but I'll be completely relaxed.

48:25.837 --> 48:28.797
Nobody will know that inside,
I'm saying,

48:28.806 --> 48:30.406
"Holy cow, this is
really something."

48:30.408 --> 48:33.478
<i> So there was a lot of great
 basic training going on</i>

48:33.478 --> 48:36.948
<i> while I was there,
 which really was preparing me</i>

48:36.948 --> 48:37.978
<i> for the studios.</i>

48:43.388 --> 48:46.158
I wound up at "the" nightclub
in Hollywood,

48:46.157 --> 48:48.587
where all the movie stars
hung out.

48:48.593 --> 48:51.693
There was a manager,
called me over one evening,

48:51.696 --> 48:54.196
and he said,
"Look, I've got a kid

48:54.198 --> 48:57.998
who's gonna be signed
by Capital Records pretty quick,

48:58.002 --> 48:59.602
and we need a drummer."

48:59.604 --> 49:03.474
This kid's name was Tommy Sands,
a wonderful young man,

49:03.474 --> 49:07.514
became a major teenage idol,
and we went on the road.

49:07.512 --> 49:10.152
But it was during that time
that I was with Tommy

49:10.148 --> 49:13.248
that I got to work with people
like The Diamonds,

49:13.251 --> 49:16.991
who were really hot
in those days. The Platters.

49:16.988 --> 49:19.788
These were shows
that I was playing.

49:19.791 --> 49:23.491
<i> Great experience. And now
 I was learning rock and roll,</i>

49:23.494 --> 49:26.704
<i> which was still a dirty word
 to most of the musicians.</i>

49:38.476 --> 49:40.036
<i> When I got back to L.A.,</i>

49:40.044 --> 49:43.154
<i> there was a man
 by the name of H.B. Barnum.</i>

49:43.147 --> 49:48.947
And H.B. started using me,
Carol Kaye on bass,

49:48.953 --> 49:50.693
and Glen Campbell on guitar.

49:50.688 --> 49:54.788
There were a bunch of us that
were sort of demo musicians,

49:54.792 --> 49:56.462
but we played rock and roll.

49:56.461 --> 49:59.061
Usually, every guy that sat
down in one of those sessions

49:59.063 --> 50:01.633
in that group
was a great musician:

50:01.632 --> 50:07.072
studied, practiced, taught well,
loved what they were doing.

50:07.071 --> 50:08.871
Everybody wanted us.

50:18.548 --> 50:23.018
<i>Do you remember when my dad
was doing the Jobim album?</i>

50:23.021 --> 50:24.221
Oh, yeah.

50:24.222 --> 50:27.562
And all of the "A" team
was in.

50:27.558 --> 50:33.398
<i>And at the end of that session,
we were doing S omethin' Stupid.</i>

50:33.398 --> 50:37.228
And the "A" team left,
and our little "B" team came in,

50:37.235 --> 50:39.635
The Wrecking Crew
came in and sat down,

50:39.637 --> 50:42.767
and we cut a number on record.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.214
And what most people
don't realize,

50:44.208 --> 50:47.078
that was our dad's
first number one record.

50:47.078 --> 50:49.478
And we just marched
on in there

50:49.480 --> 50:51.080
and made our little hit.

50:51.082 --> 50:53.022
<i>- Daddy.
- Sorry.</i>

51:00.224 --> 51:02.694
<i> I've got to sing
 a little louder then.</i>

51:02.693 --> 51:04.633
<i>-  You have to sing--
-  You too, you sing</i>

51:04.629 --> 51:08.129
<i> I did Somethin' Stupid
 with Frank and Nancy Sinatra.</i>

51:08.132 --> 51:10.472
<i> And that little lick
 that I played on the intro,</i>

51:10.468 --> 51:12.868
<i> I had already played that
 on another record of the song</i>

51:12.870 --> 51:16.170
by the guy that wrote it,
Carson Parks.

51:16.174 --> 51:21.814
And Frank heard it and wanted
that very lick on the intro.

51:21.813 --> 51:23.483
<i> Billy Strange was the arranger</i>

51:23.481 --> 51:25.381
<i> and the guitars were me
 and Glen Campbell.</i>

51:25.383 --> 51:28.323
<i> And Billy had just written,
 like, El Paso style guitar</i>

51:28.319 --> 51:29.949
<i> for the intro.
 So Glenn, of course,</i>

51:29.954 --> 51:31.294
<i> played something real nice,
 but it wasn't</i>

51:31.289 --> 51:33.319
<i>what was on the original record.
 And Frank said,</i>

51:33.324 --> 51:34.964
<i> "No, that's not it,
 that's not it. Let's try it--"</i>

51:34.959 --> 51:36.229
So Glenn tried something else

51:36.227 --> 51:38.327
and Frank wasn't
real happy with it

51:38.329 --> 51:39.999
'cause it didn't sound
like we'd heard.

51:39.997 --> 51:41.497
So finally, after a while,
I said, "Glenn,

51:41.499 --> 51:42.999
I don't want to be pushy
or anything,

51:43.000 --> 51:44.370
but that's me
on the original record.

51:44.368 --> 51:46.068
I know exactly what he wants."

51:46.070 --> 51:47.440
He said,
"Well, then you play it."

51:47.438 --> 51:49.168
Then, we switched parts real
fast and I played it.

51:49.173 --> 51:50.543
<i> Do you want to hear
 the guitars</i>

51:50.541 --> 51:51.711
<i> just to make sure
 everything's cool?</i>

51:51.709 --> 51:53.079
<i> One real fast start,
 then we'll go.</i>

51:53.077 --> 51:54.207
<i> All right, letter "A."</i>

51:56.681 --> 51:58.981
<i>- That did it, all right.
- Pretty sound.</i>

51:58.983 --> 52:00.383
<i> Yeah, that's the whole trick
 of the record.</i>

52:30.113 --> 52:32.283
Chuck Berghofer,
who was the star,

52:32.283 --> 52:36.253
you know, that bass line became
infam-- As a matter of fact,

52:36.254 --> 52:38.994
it's probably-- Simple
as it sounds, it's probably

52:38.990 --> 52:41.560
one of the hardest things
a bass player ever has to do.

52:41.559 --> 52:43.959
- Nobody can do it.
- They never do it correctly,

52:43.961 --> 52:45.561
you know, or they make
an attempt at it.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.203
The engineer came out
and said,

52:47.198 --> 52:48.758
"Gee, I love the sound
of your bass."

52:48.766 --> 52:50.866
He says, "I'm gonna
give your name to my friend."

52:50.868 --> 52:52.698
And it turned out
to be Jim Bowen.

52:52.703 --> 52:56.043
And I wound up doing some dates
for Jim Bowen.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.970
<i>About the third date, I did
was B oots Are Made For Walking.</i>

52:58.976 --> 53:01.136
<i> And that put me on the map.</i>

53:01.145 --> 53:03.375
<i> I went from doing two dates
 in my life</i>

53:03.381 --> 53:05.051
<i> to doing three a day.</i>

53:05.049 --> 53:07.649
Yeah, if I wasn't available
that day,

53:07.652 --> 53:10.492
I'd probably be selling
insurance somewhere.

53:10.488 --> 53:14.158
That "chunk-a-chunk-a-chunk,"
that rhythm chunky sound

53:14.158 --> 53:16.928
that was so--
Lee used to call it "dumb."

53:16.928 --> 53:19.498
He wanted that dumb sound.

53:19.497 --> 53:21.357
It really made--
made the records,

53:21.365 --> 53:24.225
and it's very hard to capture,
especially live.

53:32.210 --> 53:34.140
<i> Lee didn't want me
 to do the song.</i>

53:34.145 --> 53:36.545
I kept saying, "I want to do
that boots thing,

53:36.547 --> 53:38.347
that one about the boots."
And he said, "No,

53:38.349 --> 53:40.019
it's not a girl's song.
I said,

53:40.017 --> 53:42.347
"Well, it's certainly not
a guy's song."

53:42.353 --> 53:45.793
He used to sing it live
in his performances.

53:45.790 --> 53:49.430
And I said, "It's wrong
for a man to sing it.

53:49.427 --> 53:52.187
It's harsh and abusive,

53:52.196 --> 53:55.056
but it's perfect for
a little girl to sing."

54:06.243 --> 54:09.653
The feeling of a live session
was unlike anything else

54:09.647 --> 54:12.447
because you'd hear it back
instantly, and there it was.

54:12.450 --> 54:15.550
And it was either magic
or it wasn't magic.

54:15.553 --> 54:19.153
And I never will forget,
when I drove to Las Vegas,

54:19.156 --> 54:22.386
on the marquee, it says,
"Nancy Sinatra

54:22.393 --> 54:24.793
With Hal Blaine On Drums."
This big marquee

54:24.795 --> 54:27.055
all over the thing,
at Caesars Palace.

54:27.064 --> 54:31.174
Now, he's making
like $2,500 a week.

54:31.168 --> 54:34.198
Now, Irv Cottler's work
with Frank, the father,

54:34.205 --> 54:36.265
- he's making $750 a week.

54:36.274 --> 54:37.714
- And I--
- Who said life was fair?

54:37.708 --> 54:39.878
Oh, my God in hell--
And then, all of a sudden,

54:39.877 --> 54:42.137
here's this "Hal Blaine."
And I just laughed.

54:42.146 --> 54:45.106
"Hal Blaine"
all over the Caesar's marquee.

54:45.116 --> 54:46.346
- It was great.
- What a gig.

54:46.350 --> 54:48.550
You got to get it
when you can.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.070
<i> I didn't realize it
 until later,</i>

55:44.075 --> 55:47.605
<i>but New Orleans was a great town
 for a musician to grow up in.</i>

55:47.611 --> 55:51.381
My brother and I were 12 and 13,

55:51.382 --> 55:57.352
and we already had gigs
on the Mardi Gras floats.

55:57.355 --> 56:01.085
Not gigs, one gig.

56:01.092 --> 56:03.032
<i> My mother was a singer
 and a pianist.</i>

56:03.027 --> 56:08.057
And the city was raging with
soldiers, sailors, and marines

56:08.065 --> 56:11.325
coming through there to get
shipped out to World War II.

56:11.335 --> 56:13.395
<i> And the clubs
 in the French Quarter,</i>

56:13.404 --> 56:15.804
<i>they were making a lot of money</i>

56:15.806 --> 56:17.266
<i> and they were hiring
 a lot of bands.</i>

56:17.274 --> 56:19.074
My mother had a job
in the afternoon

56:19.076 --> 56:23.076
playing and singing a matinee,

56:23.080 --> 56:24.880
and my father had a night gig.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.782
And I think it was the first
time in their life

56:27.785 --> 56:33.185
that they were fully employed
as musicians.

56:33.190 --> 56:37.530
I went to a black
Catholic high school,

56:37.528 --> 56:41.528
and all the public schools
were segregated.

56:41.532 --> 56:45.032
I couldn't wait to get away.

56:45.035 --> 56:48.195
<i> My brother and I
 soon established a band,</i>

56:48.205 --> 56:49.505
<i> you know. He played piano.</i>

56:49.507 --> 56:54.307
He mostly played blues
and boogie and--

56:54.311 --> 56:56.511
We wanted to play be-bop,
but really,

56:56.514 --> 56:59.684
nobody wanted to hear it.

56:59.683 --> 57:02.653
People always tell me
how great I was and, you know,

57:02.653 --> 57:04.723
"That boy's really
going places," and--

57:04.722 --> 57:08.622
of course I believed that.

57:14.798 --> 57:18.628
In 1954, my brother and I
moved down to Los Angeles

57:18.636 --> 57:24.136
and proceeded to starve
around town for about two years,

57:24.141 --> 57:25.641
made all the jam sessions.

57:25.643 --> 57:27.313
That's what you do
when you're new in town.

57:27.311 --> 57:30.881
And that sooner or later
gets you work

57:30.881 --> 57:33.751
because the band leaders
come to the jam sessions

57:33.751 --> 57:37.721
looking for horn players
or rhythm players.

57:37.721 --> 57:40.891
<i>And that's where they found 'em,
 at the jam sessions.</i>

57:40.891 --> 57:42.831
The rock and roll thing
was getting really big,

57:42.827 --> 57:46.527
and they needed
the kind of horn I play.

57:46.530 --> 57:49.360
So it was really being
in the right place

57:49.366 --> 57:53.136
at the right time.

58:02.912 --> 58:05.382
<i>Particularly when I got
on the Merv Griffin Show,</i>

58:05.382 --> 58:07.882
which started
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

58:07.885 --> 58:10.745
Well, that's the time
my kids came home from school.

58:10.754 --> 58:15.164
And it ended at 8:30 at night,
and I'd get home maybe 9:30.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.189
<i> Well, that's the time
 my kids would go to bed .</i>

58:17.194 --> 58:20.164
<i> Many days,
 I didn't see my kids.</i>

58:23.033 --> 58:26.603
<i> I'm a better grandfather
 than I was a father.</i>

58:42.019 --> 58:42.889
That's great.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.787
Oh, amazing.

58:45.789 --> 58:48.759
I remember taking
this picture.

58:48.759 --> 58:51.359
I took it through a record,
through a 45.

58:51.362 --> 58:53.462
These were all yours.
Hey, that's nice.

58:53.464 --> 58:54.834
<i> Yeah.</i>

58:54.832 --> 58:57.472
<i> The first band I had
 was just an experiment.</i>

58:57.468 --> 58:59.698
We opened the show
for Dave Brubeck,

58:59.703 --> 59:04.643
and people went crazy for the--
our, you know, half hour set,

59:04.642 --> 59:08.142
however long we played.
And I remember coming offstage,

59:08.145 --> 59:14.045
and Paul Desmond was--
was standing off to the side.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.551
And as I passed him,
he was scratching his head,

59:16.554 --> 59:19.394
and said, "I don't know
what I just heard,

59:19.390 --> 59:23.260
but I think I like it."

59:23.260 --> 59:24.530
That was the first cue I had

59:24.528 --> 59:26.558
that maybe we were
on to something.

59:26.564 --> 59:29.504
A jazz musician loved it...
or liked it.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.730
The first date I ever did
for Herb Alpert,

59:31.735 --> 59:33.335
Shorty Rogers called me up
and says,

59:33.337 --> 59:34.797
"Bill, would you do me a favor?"

59:34.805 --> 59:37.065
He says, "There's a guy,
he's a friend of mine."

59:37.074 --> 59:39.514
He says, "He's a trumpet player
and he doesn't have any money.

59:39.510 --> 59:41.140
Would you do it
as a favor for me?"

59:41.145 --> 59:42.605
I said, "Sure, I'll do it."

59:42.613 --> 59:45.153
Herb gave us each 15 bucks.
It was a scab date.

59:45.149 --> 59:48.179
- Oh, well, most of 'em were...
- Right, yeah.

59:48.185 --> 59:50.115
When we first started
way back then, you know.

59:50.120 --> 59:52.960
- Right. It was $15.
- Two for a quarter.

59:52.957 --> 59:55.287
- Yeah, two for 25.

59:55.292 --> 59:56.862
<i>And that was The Lonely Bull.</i>

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:05.265
That was the first huge hit
that Herb Alpert ever had.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.639
It was huge!

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.197
He became a millionaire
on that one record.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:11.935
And you know what he did?
He went to the union,

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.082
said what he did,
paid the union fine,

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:17.408
and then had checks sent
to all the musicians for scale,

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:22.624
that-- that they were supposed
to have gotten and didn't.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.250
<i>A signature moment
in A Taste of Honey</i>

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.094
is when the bass drum
is knocking four to the floor.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.961
We didn't have a way
to get back to the time

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.700
without, you know, a count off.
And Hal, you know, said,

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.927
"Let me just hit the drum,
the bass drum.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.103
Everyone will know
when to come in."

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:44.239
Larry Levine thought--
The engineer,

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.211
that we should keep that,
and it was, you know,

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.380
one of the things that people
remember about the record.

01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:52.549
And it became kind of
a trademark of the T.J.B.S.

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:54.219
It was all because

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:56.918
these professional musicians
couldn't come in together.

01:01:02.593 --> 01:01:04.993
<i> I met Julius in high school.</i>

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.255
We started playing a song
and he took a solo,

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.604
and I thought,
"Wow, man,

01:01:08.599 --> 01:01:10.799
this guy sounds
like Lionel Hampton."

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.471
<i>He wrote Spanish Flea,</i>

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:14.939
although his first title
was "Spanish Fly,"

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:16.908
and I said, "I-- I don't know,
I'm not sure--

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:21.637
I'm not so sure
that title's gonna work.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.189
You know, when The T.J.B.
became famous

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:39.162
and he had to create a group
to go on the road,

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.433
none of the studio musicians
would do it

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.632
because they were too busy.

01:01:43.634 --> 01:01:46.904
We did 13 albums,
and this was something

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:49.204
that bothered me my whole life,
my whole career.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.036
We'd come back to town,
and I would call

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:55.411
guys like Lou and Hal.
And the guys on the road...

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:57.452
Yeah, were really upset.

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.878
They were a little offended
that they were not used,

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.723
but you know,
recording musicians had

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:06.149
a certain sound
that was important to get.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.289
<i> No matter what shape
 your stomach's in,</i>

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.255
<i> when it gets out of shape,
 take Alka-Seltzer.</i>

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.074
I saw a commercial,
and I thought it was a smash.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.137
I called Dave Pell,
who was my supervisor,

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:22.137
and I said, "What instrumental
groups do we have here?"

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:25.639
And he said, "Well, we have
a name called The T-Bones."

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.612
And I say, "All right."
So I got Tommy Tedesco

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:29.811
and the boys,
in the studio we went,

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:32.213
<i>and we did No Matter What Shape."</i>

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:34.746
And that was the number-one
instrumental of the year.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:35.782
<i> The T-Bones!</i>

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:49.663
 )

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.210
What is their name,
"Willy Vanelli"

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.078
- or what the hell the shit is?
- Milli--

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.037
- They had nothing over us....
- Right.

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:03.775
...right?
We did that all the time.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.311
I wanted The Marketts to be
like a working group.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:10.386
And, you know, if the public
knew it wasn't so,

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:14.957
it would be like a
"Mini Vanilli" or whatever.

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:28.238
I think it's a little
different when you're a

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:31.568
horn player and you're asked
to play the introduction

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:34.235
- and play the first chorus...
- I can understand that.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:37.954
...and play the first solo, and
then play the fade on the end.

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:40.978
And the damn thing comes on and
it doesn't have your name on it.

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:52.028
<i> Surfer's Stomp-- Plas Johnson
was the lead saxophonist,</i>

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:55.129
and I said, "Plas, how about
calling it The Plas Johnson?"

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:57.032
And he's says, "no,"
he says,

01:03:57.034 --> 01:03:58.874
"I don't want to be associated
with that type of music."

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.539
I mean, he was a much better
player than that,

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.868
but it became a hit and so we
call it The Marketts.

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:05.544
And then I start getting calls.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:09.182
<i>So, the song writer, who
co-wrote S urfer's Stomp with me</i>

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.449
called Mike Gordon,
he got a group together,

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.608
went on the road.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.116
Worse than not getting
the money,

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:17.847
is to have-- to played on a hit
record which sold

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.415
a million copies, and not even
have your name on them.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:24.034
And they go dig some white kids
up out of high school

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:28.327
and put them on the road
and call them the name.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.172
And it was quite easy
for the producers

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:33.097
and the companies to hire us to
read this music.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.273
And play these things down,
in three hours

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.372
and get out of that studio
in three hours

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.884
than to have them come and spend
three weeks doing it.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:43.547
We would either augment
or totally replace a group.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:48.747
We do a new group, say
The Association, for instance.

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:50.822
<i> None of them played
 on the record.</i>

01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:52.721
<i> We replaced the entire group.</i>

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:08.503
<i>Well, these are the guys that
played on Windy</i>

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:11.035
<i>and Never My Love and
 Everything That Touches You.</i>

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.611
And all the things that were
in those two albums

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:17.951
that I did with them, those are
all those studio musicians.

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:21.318
<i>It's Al, Joe, Larry, Tommy and--
 and those guys.</i>

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:23.848
I wanted to put their names
on the back of the album

01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:26.324
when it was finished
and they wouldn't let me

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:29.063
because they said, "Well, we
don't want those kids out there

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.689
that buy our records to know
that we didn't

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:32.364
play on the record."

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:35.762
<i> I went out and took Brian's
 place with The Beach Boys.</i>

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:39.266
And I can understand that
probably why Brian had studio

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:44.669
guys come in, because they would
fight like cats and dogs, man.

01:05:44.675 --> 01:05:48.235
<i>Rather than Brian to go through
 the hassle to get the tracks,</i>

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:51.675
<i>he would hire the rhythm section
 to come in and do the tracks.</i>

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:54.452
<i>One of the guys-- At first they
 were a little jealous,</i>

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.381
<i> you know what I mean?
But I explained to them, I said,</i>

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:59.646
<i> "You know, I want to get the
 best I can get for the group."</i>

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:02.116
And they go, "Well, I can
understand your point, Brian,"

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.685
you know.
So we went ahead and did it,

01:06:04.695 --> 01:06:08.055
and sure enough,
the guys liked it.

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:11.025
I mean, that's one of the most
asked questions,

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:13.304
"Well, didn't Dennis get mad,
wasn't he mad

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.603
because you were doing
The Beach Boys records?"

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:20.705
Dennis did not have the studio
chops that we have, you know.

01:06:20.711 --> 01:06:22.741
The proof of the pudding
is that Dennis

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:26.206
called me to do his album when
Dennis did his solo album.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:27.846
I played the drums on that.

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:30.551
A lot of times the guys would
be sitting around the studio,

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.454
we didn't know they were the
guys in the band.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:35.416
The guitar players that were
in these various groups,

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:37.455
when they realized guys like
Tommy Tedesco

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:40.001
was gonna be playing, they
wanted to sit around and watch.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:41.197
And the drummers would want
to sit around

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:42.698
and watch myself or Al.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.569
<i> They were there, like, more or
 less they were learning.</i>

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.798
You know, it would be something
that I'd like to see too

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:48.273
if it had been
the other way around.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:50.211
<i> Terry Melcher wanted to use
 session musicians</i>

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:51.767
<i> for Mr. Tambourine Man.</i>

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:53.375
I'd been a studio musician
in New York,

01:06:53.377 --> 01:06:55.737
prior to being in The Byrds,
so...

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.106
they let me play on it.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:59.014
So my feeling was,
"Great. I get to play

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:00.846
with this great band,
The Wrecking Crew."

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.551
Of course, the other guys,
David Crosby,

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:05.852
Michael Clark and
Chris Hellman, were livid.

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:07.016
They hated the idea because

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:08.294
they didn't get to play
on their own record.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.561
We got a number one hit with it,
right off the bat.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.530
But we knocked out two tracks
in one three-hour session.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.860
To compare that with what
happened when the rest

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:18.566
of the band got to play,
it took us 77 takes

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:21.968
<i>to get the band track for
 Turn, Turn, Turn,</i>

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:23.712
which was also a number one.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:09.075
People assume that just
because my dad made his living

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:11.616
playing guitar, I can also play.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.521
For me, and some of the other
kids of studio musicians,

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.524
we didn't take it up
as a profession.

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:19.486
What my father did teach us
was common sense.

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:21.296
<i> I got called
 many years ago.</i>

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.828
I show up on this date and now
there's 70 musicians

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.304
sitting there.
And I'm looking

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.242
and I say, "70 musicians?
Wow. Where do I sit?"

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:29.968
And they said, "Over there.
There's the guitar."

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.143
You know, I sit there
and I look at a part.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:35.742
The only problem is starting at
bar 95, you know,

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.005
and all the rest, rest.

01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.953
Now the guy starts, right.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.448
And you know what this is to me
at the time.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.180
This is in a nightclub, you
know, you see a chick,

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.245
"Hey, there she is.
Hey, hey--"

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:46.524
When he did this and there was
no music, I said,

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:48.563
"Oh-oh, they're at bar 95,
I knew it."

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:51.188
"Guitar. Where's the guitar?"
"Over here."

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:52.294
"We're at 95,
I didn't hear you."

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.654
"Oh, okay," you know.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:58.233
- One, two, three, four,

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.665
"Okay, forget it.
Let's go from 96.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.000
And they have somebody come in
the next day to do it."

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:05.836
Elvis Presley came back there
a few years

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.212
and I started getting hot
in records, and Elvis

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.281
started using me when he'd come
to the coast for movies.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.010
So nobody told Elvis who to use.

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:16.175
To that day I never knew if they
knew I was the same guy, though.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.845
But I wasn't about to tell them,
"Remember me?

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:20.493
About three years--"
Oh, no, no, no.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.060
You see, the one thing I have,
common sense.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.288
I studied common sense more
than I did guitar.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.466
In the '60s,
The Wrecking Crew played

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:39.214
on thousands of recordings,

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.408
but you would never
have known it.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:44.911
Producers made a big mistake
when they didn't put

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:47.175
the credits on the back
of the albums

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.084
of all the people that have
played on the albums.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:52.314
<i> Not only did they deserve it,
 but I think it was misleading.</i>

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:54.962
Maybe one of the reasons they
left the names off was

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:58.058
the same musicians played on so
many people's records

01:09:58.061 --> 01:10:00.061
it would have been an
embarrassment if anybody

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.733
had ever listed them.

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:04.301
I was used to it
'cause when a guy hired me

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:07.071
with his last $25
and he had a bomb,

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.340
I never gave him his
money back, you know.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.369
So I really treated it
as a business

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.984
and I understand how you
feel too. But I just felt,

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:17.548
"Just give me my money
and I get lost."

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:29.062
<i> Snuffy always let myself
 and The Playboys</i>

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.959
<i> lay down all the basic tracks.</i>

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:34.561
<i> And then Snuff said,
 "Now we're gonna sweeten it,</i>

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:37.174
<i> do some overdubs and stuff,
 and I'm gonna bring in</i>

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:38.627
<i>the people that I want to use ."</i>

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:42.265
And I had no experience in this,
and Snuffy had.

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:43.942
So I said,
"Well, great.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.440
If you think that's the way to
do it, let's do it."

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:50.713
The drummer came in, but
Snuffy let him, you know,

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:53.114
play some kind of percussion
like a tambourine

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:56.246
so it could say,
"Gary Lewis and The Playboys."

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:59.153
But it was really studio guys
that made the track.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:03.455
And I remember my guitar
player and our keyboard player,

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.690
after hearing the session
musicians coming in

01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:09.556
and putting down the parts,
you know, they were saying,

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:12.666
"Oh, my God, I never could have
done anything like that."

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:15.399
<i> I'll never forget working
with Gary Lewis and The Playboys</i>

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:17.235
<i> - doing all that record.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.680
And I'll never forget I had
one real, real hot lick

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:25.348
on this one record-- Spanish
stuff all over the place.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:37.360
And finally, his guitar player
come up to me, he says,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.690
"You drove me crazy
with that thing.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.826
First of all, I can't play it,
so I don't play it.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.902
And then, everybody comes up to
me, complimenting me

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.502
on what I did on the thing."

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.444
I said, "Well, just take the
compliments and forget it."

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:53.209
So, while my guitar players
played a much simplified

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:56.239
version of it, because nobody
could play that.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.951
That was inside stuff.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.893
I think that the public at large
was oblivious to the fact

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:10.590
that there was a secret star
maker machinery,

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:14.403
that a very important component
of that were these teams,

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:17.067
like hitmen, studio hitmen.

01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:18.127
Nobody cared.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.634
All they wanted was the product.

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:21.996
They just wanted the name
and the sales.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:23.465
Who created it?
Psh.

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:24.973
That was incidental.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.594
Tell him your story, Hal,
about The Monkees.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.787
Because the newspapers came in
to talk to them

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.490
and we were in the next studio
cutting their stuff.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:46.063
And then they were pretending
that they were doing it

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.662
there in the studios.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.664
- Well, you just told it.
- Tell him the story.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:53.366
Well, you told the story.
Did you get it?

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:58.809
I'd never considered myself
a musician.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:01.078
I-- You know, 'cause to me a
musician is someone

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:04.747
who does session work,
who shows up and reads charts.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:07.008
And I always approached
The Monkees as an actor,

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:10.616
playing the part of a drummer
in this imaginary group,

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.190
that lived in this imaginary
beach house

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:14.789
and had these imaginary
adventures.

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:17.491
To me, that always-- always
been what it's about.

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:19.934
Peter does tell the story of
going into some

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:23.029
of the early sessions. And he
walked in with his guitar

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.832
and his bass, and they said,
"What are you doing here?"

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:29.135
"Well, we've already done the
track. Micky's gonna sing."

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:31.769
"So, what--? You invited me
for a recording session."

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:35.935
He said, "Yeah." I said,
"Well, what are you doing?"

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:39.545
He said, "We have the record, we
just need to put a vocal on it."

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:41.319
They said, "Just go home.
Relax."

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:43.647
One, two, three, four.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.562
- Mikey, you like it?
- You like it?

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:58.225
That's terrible.
That's the worst thing--

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.474
I had no idea who these guys
were in these early sessions.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.071
It was my first session.

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:05.572
And I was introduced to them,
"These are the musicians."

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:06.935
I was the vocalist.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.913
<i>I remember Hal Blaine giving me
 some pointers</i>

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:12.352
<i>in the sessions, and Earl Palmer
 would give me some pointers.</i>

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.978
<i> But I didn't have to play
 at that point.</i>

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.553
They said, "You're gonna start
drum lessons on Monday."

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:18.993
And I did.
And I had about a year.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:23.518
So, by the time I had to
actually play on stage, live,

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:24.986
I wasn't that bad.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.264
I mean, I only had to play
our songs, obviously,

01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:29.003
and they were pretty simple
pop tunes.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:33.628
Hal and Earl do this stuff
with one hand in their sleep.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:46.752
The fans, they didn't know
or care, and I was like,

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.619
"What's the deal?
This is a television show

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.049
you know.
What is the big deal?"

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:53.724
But you know, back then,
and even to this day,

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:56.663
a lot of people take their
rock and roll very seriously

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.689
and, you know-- And it's,
you know,

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:01.895
rock and roll is
no laughing matter.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.528
You're not supposed
to have fun, you know.

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:06.234
It has to be
very serious.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:07.636
It makes sense now to me.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:08.897
If I were doing the project,

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.805
I would do it exactly
the same way.

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:13.367
Uh, but, uh, at the time, it
didn't make any sense to me.

01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:14.906
I didn't understand.

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:16.641
- Were you upset?
- Yeah, I was upset.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:19.676
<i> I thought that-- I mean,
 I was very naive.</i>

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:23.652
I regard how upset I was as a
function of my naiveté.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:26.723
I always thought I was gonna be
in a recording session,

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:28.323
and play the guitar,
and do the things,

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:30.964
and sing the background vocals,
and all the rest of that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.860
I had no idea that they had
just gone

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.732
and made the tracks without us.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.731
I don't think there was any
backlash to the discovery

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:39.603
that The Monkees didn't play
their own instruments initially,

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.472
because everybody knew
it was common practice.

01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:43.041
I saw them in everybody's
session.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:46.439
I remember in RCA Victor going
to The Mamas and Papas,

01:15:46.442 --> 01:15:48.182
who were next door,
and there was Hal Blaine.

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:51.647
And then, he'd come over
and do one of our sessions.

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.848
And then off to do
somebody else, I guess.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.620
<i>I knew they played on virtually
 all The Beach Boys records.</i>

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.619
You know, we got a lot of shit
for it,

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:01.691
but I think finally, you know,
some of those guys

01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.791
are coming clean.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:25.711
<i> Barry McGuire had found this
song called California Dreamin'</i>

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:26.905
<i> that he wanted to record.</i>

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.916
And these four,
kind of scruffy looking,

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.649
two guys and two girls
came to the studio

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:32.924
because Barry wanted
them to sing

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.022
background parts on his record.

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:37.634
And he said to Lou, "They're a
great sounding vocal group.

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:39.287
You should hear them sing."

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.025
<i>John Phillips wrote this song,
 California Dreamin'.</i>

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.931
So while the band was on a ten,
Lou and I went down the hall

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.874
to studio two,
with the four of them.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:50.399
<i>And John had a guitar and they
sang California Dreamin'.</i>

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.784
<i> Lou said, "What do you think?"</i>

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.852
<i> And I said, "If you don't take
 them, I will," you know.</i>

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:05.721
After hearing their vocals--
their background vocals,

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:07.662
I thought it should be
their record.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:10.687
When I started to do
The Mamas and The Papas,

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:14.363
I put Joe Osborn in that group
with Hal Blaine.

01:17:14.364 --> 01:17:19.534
And that's when Hal, and Larry
and myself worked together

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:21.135
as a group for the first time.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.437
I wasn't really busy.
At that point,

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:25.839
I wasn't busy
as a studio player.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:28.512
And Hal helped get me
into that area.

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:32.011
Those kinds of combinations of
what Joe brought to Hal Blaine,

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:35.045
and what Hal Blaine brought to
Joe Osborn was great.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:44.125
In the case of
The mamas and Papas,

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:50.127
John Phillips would run the song
down on rhythm guitar.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.633
At the same time,
Hal would be taking notes,

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:54.465
Glen Campbell
might be taking notes.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.100
And then we say,
"Okay, let's run it down."

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:59.035
They had parts in mind
so that you could then edit,

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.842
"Yeah, that's good,
let's keep it.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.913
That's not, can you try
something else?"

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.482
But they had a lot to do with
the arrangements.

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:08.681
<i> Members of The Mamas
 and The Papas teach the song</i>

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:09.975
<i> to the musicians.</i>

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.246
<i> There is no arrangement
 or score.</i>

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.166
<i> The musicians decide
 what they should play</i>

01:18:30.173 --> 01:18:34.643
<i> against the vocals.
 A rhythm gets going.</i>

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:40.817
Producers presented the
musicians with a road map.

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:44.817
It was just chord symbols.
And that was about as far

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:47.091
as it went.
Now, these musicians

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:51.660
took that information and, you
know, added a little flavor

01:18:51.661 --> 01:18:53.791
to it that was unexpected.
A lot of times it was,

01:18:53.796 --> 01:18:57.796
you know, much more than you
had hoped for.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:40.136
People come over and say,
"Did you this?

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.183
Would you work with this group?"
I said, "I don't remember."

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.678
"Well, I saw your name
on the album."

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.009
"Then I did."
You know, that's--

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:46.454
- Right.
- 'Cause you work so much,

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:47.579
you have no idea.

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:50.553
The studio player of 1999,
they would--

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.153
If they're not playing all
the time,

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.155
they would need to do
what we never needed to do,

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.457
was practice.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.788
All the time you're practicing,
while being paid.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.464
It's funny. Earl and I were
talking one time.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:02.162
It's like, you couldn't judge
anybody by how much

01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:03.725
they were working 'cause
everybody was working

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:04.933
all the time.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.366
You had to just go by how much
work you turned down.

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:10.140
Most of us were so fortunate
to have been in

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:14.279
at the original beginnings of
rock and roll.

01:20:14.277 --> 01:20:16.407
Fuck, I say it, I made more
money playing rock and roll

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:17.782
than I ever made playing jazz.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.250
There was one point
in the mid '60s that

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:23.219
I was making more money than the
president of the United States.

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:25.019
I remember I used to kid
Carol. I'd say,

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:28.321
"Do you realize, Carol,
if I got a divorce and you--

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.294
We could get married and
what a year we'd have of money.

01:20:31.294 --> 01:20:32.864
Between all your money
and my money,

01:20:32.862 --> 01:20:34.402
- we'd be killing everybody."

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.257
Including each other.

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:43.239
This is where we did Sinatra,

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:44.669
Dean Martin,

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.944
Sammy Davis Jr.

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:49.012
We did everybody in there.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:52.481
It's just an amazing place.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.221
In my particular case,

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:57.817
I bought an incredible mansion
in Hollywood.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.490
I had a magnificent yacht.

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:02.219
I had a gorgeous Rolls Royce.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:05.485
<i> But, out of nowhere,
I had a wife who all of a sudden</i>

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:07.234
<i> declared, "I want a divorce."</i>

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:09.560
"What? What are you talking
about?

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:12.595
I just went for a sandwich
and--"

01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:15.002
It's, like, impossible
to believe.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:17.204
<i> And in order for her
 to get paid off,</i>

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.606
<i> you sell everything you own.</i>

01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:22.879
I had 170-something gold
records.

01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:25.409
<i> I had to sell them all.</i>

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:28.524
<i> The house was sold for a third
 of what it was worth.</i>

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:32.087
<i> I had to let the yacht go.
 The yacht was repossessed.</i>

01:21:32.088 --> 01:21:35.918
<i> I never had anything
 repossessed in my life.</i>

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:39.955
It's just a shame to get
wiped out that seriously.

01:21:39.962 --> 01:21:42.262
<i> I had been working with
 John Denver,</i>

01:21:42.265 --> 01:21:46.125
<i> almost 5 grand a week
 for almost ten years,</i>

01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:48.535
<i> and all of a sudden,
 that job ended.</i>

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.867
Terrible, terrible thing
to have to go through.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:53.843
I mean, it's--
You certainly,

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:55.713
in the realm of suicide,

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:58.781
you certainly think about it.

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:02.021
I was working
in Scottsdale, Arizona,

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.588
and I was a security guard,

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.417
plain and simple.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.392
Here I went from...
all this money

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:12.262
and this magnificent estate
and everything else involved,

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:15.061
and all of a sudden
I was reduced to

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:17.804
living in a clothes closet.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.370
Came out of about 23 rooms
in Hollywood.

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:23.900
And it was like
the end of the world.

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.717
<i> This was Gold Star.</i>

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:37.217
<i> So this is it.
 This is what's left.</i>

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:39.049
<i> And it was an amazing time,</i>

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:41.055
<i> and it was such
 a historical place.</i>

01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:43.757
<i> They had a lot of first-time
 big hit people</i>

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.659
<i> come here and make their
 records.</i>

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:48.861
<i> Across the street, we recorded
 The Captain & Tennille</i>

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:52.204
<i> doing Love Will Keep Us
Together.</i>

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.971
Boy, they had a number one,

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:57.710
it was record of the year
that year.

01:22:57.707 --> 01:23:00.537
It was my last record
of the year.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:26.370
In L.A., I'd heard that things
were picking up again...

01:23:26.369 --> 01:23:29.299
you know '82, '83,
something like that.

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:32.165
And then I was also
getting a few calls,

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:36.284
and all of a sudden,
I was working again.

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:39.148
<i> One of the great highlights
 was when I was inducted</i>

01:23:39.148 --> 01:23:41.148
<i> into the Rock and Roll
 Hall of Fame.</i>

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:43.150
<i> So in the year 2000,</i>

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:46.492
<i> me and Earl Palmer
 were both inducted.</i>

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:49.559
<i> You know, Earl was just--
 I can't thank him enough.</i>

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:51.788
<i> Earl recommending me
 in the beginning,</i>

01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:56.864
<i> it made a name for myself.
 It really was that simple.</i>

01:23:56.866 --> 01:24:00.526
You know,
I've always said...

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:04.806
if you love your work,
it's not work,

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:07.067
you know?
We loved our work, man.

01:24:07.076 --> 01:24:08.836
That's how we could work
day and night,

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:11.554
'cause we loved it.

01:24:19.922 --> 01:24:21.262
I'll never forget a session

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:23.417
we were all doing
with Don Costa.

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:26.726
And I start playing rhythm
and he stopped and he said,

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.659
"Glen, you got the lead there."

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:30.564
And, boy, I said...

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.466
I said, "Mr. Costa,
I can't read notes."

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:34.328
He said, "Well, you know
the melody, don't you?"

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:36.066
And I said, "Yeah."
He said, "Well, just--

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:38.472
That's the melody."
I said, "Oh, okay, great."

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:40.574
He would ask Tedesco,
"How does that figure go

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.606
- or this figure go," you know?
- Right, exactly.

01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:45.211
And then he would sit there
and work it out.

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:48.724
And we'd make the records
and it was always perfect.

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:51.717
Yeah. Well, he had
a certain thing that he offered

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.790
that they wanted.

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:56.288
Wonderful ear and a wonderful
facility on the instrument.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:58.692
<i> Glen came up
 with great ideas,</i>

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:00.664
<i> and his solos were just super.</i>

01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:02.633
And then all of a sudden,
he's a singing star.

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:05.171
Well, he always could sing.
We used to kid him about,

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:06.797
"Oh, he's standing up
and singing now,

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:09.602
he's gonna be a big star."
But he became a big star.

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:15.083
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:16.877
I'm Glen Campbell.

01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:18.549
I'd mixed, actually,
the first record.

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:20.577
That record that he made
for Capitol--

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:21.723
I mixed that record.

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:24.177
And it was like a really
surprise to see him come in

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:26.046
and say, "I'm singing
on this record, I'm gonna..."

01:25:26.055 --> 01:25:27.115
you know...

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:29.063
And the record was a hit

01:25:29.058 --> 01:25:31.758
and his vocal career
was launched.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.230
And when he got out
and became a singing star,

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:37.531
guess who he called
to back him up?

01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:39.503
- That's right, yeah.
- We were all there for him.

01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:42.102
I remember Tedesco
playing on...

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:44.104
I forget what it was.

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:46.566
He said, "You still talking
to us peons?"

01:25:48.444 --> 01:25:51.384
I said, "Well, some of 'em."

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.710
<i> But it was great having
 the guys do the sessions.</i>

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:57.246
<i> I knew who all the good
 players were.</i>

01:25:57.253 --> 01:26:00.653
<i> Playing Wichita Lineman,
 it had a chord to it.</i>

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:02.916
I don't think
it had any part written.

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:09.058
you know. She says,
"How about this for a kickoff

01:26:09.064 --> 01:26:10.964
<i>on Wichita Lineman?"
She came up with that.</i>

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:29.319
Glen Campbell was a heck
of a guitar player,

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:31.448
and I had this
Dano bass guitar

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:34.693
that had special pickups
and bridge and strings on it

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.890
and it got a really great
gutty sound.

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.732
<i> And he picked it up
 and did the solo on it.</i>

01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:40.888
<i> It was great.</i>

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:50.639
<i>I heard W ichita Lineman
at a drugstore one time</i>

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.609
and it just brought tears
to my eyes,

01:26:52.608 --> 01:26:55.538
'cause that tune
meant a lot to me.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:12.429
<i> I did all that early
 Glen Campbell stuff,</i>

01:27:12.428 --> 01:27:15.528
<i> all of it...
 up to Southern Nights,</i>

01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:17.831
<i> when he changed producers
 and I didn't do anymore.</i>

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.933
<i> Glen by this time was trying--
recording-- using his own band.</i>

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:23.536
I'm sitting in Martoni's
one night there in Hollywood,

01:27:23.539 --> 01:27:27.039
and Steve Turner, his drummer,
walked in.

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:29.982
And he said, "You're not gonna
believe what just happened."

01:27:29.979 --> 01:27:31.849
"What?"
And he said, "I'm just coming

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:35.017
from a session with Glen,
and we're trying to get this kid

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:37.047
to play some decent
rhythm guitar."

01:27:37.052 --> 01:27:41.662
Glen says, "Well, give me that
big, full Al Casey sound."

01:27:41.657 --> 01:27:44.487
I said, "Does he know that
I'm available tonight?"

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:45.993
you know.
But I understand

01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:47.625
he was trying to use
his own band.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.100
But when stuff like that
starts happening,

01:27:49.098 --> 01:27:51.928
that's-- that's a signal.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:55.374
<i> I think a lot of us felt
 this just might go on forever.</i>

01:27:55.371 --> 01:27:57.471
And that was
the first great shock

01:27:57.473 --> 01:28:00.613
for many of us who had
setbacks in our careers

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:03.079
and realized that,
"Hey, this is an up-down...

01:28:03.078 --> 01:28:05.348
up-down thing."

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:07.577
<i> Sports figures seem to have
 a ten-year period</i>

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.783
<i> when it all happens for them.</i>

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.885
So what you get
is you get the ramp up,

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:15.157
you get ten great years,
and you get the ramp down.

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:17.217
And the trick is to make
the ramp down

01:28:17.226 --> 01:28:20.186
last as long as
you possibly can.

01:28:20.195 --> 01:28:21.855
<i> Who would hire me
 at my age then,</i>

01:28:21.864 --> 01:28:23.304
<i> to be in a rock group?</i>

01:28:23.299 --> 01:28:24.929
They weren't doing
that anymore,

01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:27.673
because now the rock guys
were doing their stuff.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.070
And writing,
which they always did,

01:28:29.071 --> 01:28:31.841
but they were able
to perform it.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.110
<i> As Dylan said, "The times,
 they are a-changing."</i>

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:36.680
<i> it just changed.</i>

01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:39.409
New game.
new way of doing it.

01:28:39.415 --> 01:28:41.445
I don't think it was
a conscious decision

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.880
that, you know, these musicians
play a certain way

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:47.246
and now we better
get more contemporary.

01:28:47.256 --> 01:28:49.186
<i> In my case, it had to do
 with the artist</i>

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:51.021
<i> or who the artist
 brought with them.</i>

01:28:51.026 --> 01:28:52.386
<i> In the case of Carole King,</i>

01:28:52.394 --> 01:28:54.264
<i> she brought a rhythm section
 with her.</i>

01:28:54.263 --> 01:28:56.703
<i> She brought James Taylor
 on guitar.</i>

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:58.569
<i> I think the bands
 learned to play.</i>

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:00.767
It was more important
for the public to know

01:29:00.769 --> 01:29:04.369
that the bands were really
playing the music.

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:06.273
<i> You had these groups
 that came up</i>

01:29:06.275 --> 01:29:08.675
<i> in the late '60s
 and into the '70s...</i>

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.477
<i> The Buffalo Springfield that
 became Crosby, Stills & Nash.</i>

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.780
And these were all
self-contained groups that,

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:16.352
for the most part,
never used studio musicians.

01:29:16.352 --> 01:29:17.682
And those things became huge.

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:20.386
And that's where album artists
became really big.

01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:22.759
Well, it had a huge effect
and...

01:29:22.758 --> 01:29:25.758
you know, the singer/songwriter
acts

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:28.431
became very important
to people.

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:32.170
They started wanting bands
that played their own stuff.

01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:34.997
<i> It really had an effect
 on the session musicians.</i>

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:36.973
<i> I'd kinda left by then.</i>

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:38.842
We all went into it

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:42.281
knowing it could stop
any second.

01:29:42.277 --> 01:29:43.837
It was never meant to last.

01:29:43.846 --> 01:29:46.546
I was just like this
magical bubble

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.148
that just kind of...

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:51.321
blossomed for a second...

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.890
hung there in the air...

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:58.089
Hal plays on seven
records of the year in a row.

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:00.463
Seven in a row...

01:30:00.462 --> 01:30:03.202
and then the bubble... poof.
Pops.

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:04.928
It's new people.
it's a new regime.

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:07.903
We came in at a certain time,
when we were all new.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:10.503
All the new people
are coming in now,

01:30:10.506 --> 01:30:13.236
when they are new--
Young, vibrant,

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:16.312
playing today's sounds.
It's that simple.

01:30:43.906 --> 01:30:46.136
As the record dates with
The Wrecking Crew diminished,

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:49.511
my father was one of the more
fortunate musicians.

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:51.811
His versatility,
combined with his ability

01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:54.924
to read music in seconds,
led to thousands of recordings

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:56.517
in film and television.

01:30:56.518 --> 01:30:58.288
He worked with some of
the greatest composers

01:30:58.287 --> 01:30:59.747
in American music:

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:02.015
John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith,

01:31:02.024 --> 01:31:03.724
Henry Mancini, Bill Conti,

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:05.785
James Horner, Burt Bacharach,

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:08.704
Lalo Schifrin,
just to name a few.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.528
In the '70s,
my father started playing

01:31:12.534 --> 01:31:14.534
for his own enjoyment.

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:17.836
It was the first time
I remember seeing him at home

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.110
with the guitar.

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:22.238
He got into doing seminars

01:31:22.244 --> 01:31:24.384
and that's what he really
enjoyed.

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:25.849
He was flying around
the country.

01:31:25.848 --> 01:31:29.678
And he arranged his seminars
on weekends

01:31:29.685 --> 01:31:31.815
so that he could be home
during the week...

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.620
in case there was
any calls.

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.262
Let me give you
what I call

01:31:35.257 --> 01:31:37.317
"the creative
studio guitar player".

01:31:37.326 --> 01:31:38.956
About a year ago,

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:41.531
I got the call
to do a John Denver special.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:44.060
It was John Denver in Mexico,

01:31:44.066 --> 01:31:45.966
and they wanted some--
He was on a fishing vessel

01:31:45.968 --> 01:31:48.438
and they wanted some Mexican
music, so I gave them this:

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:09.021
<i>Got a call to do
 Charlie's Angels.</i>

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.064
They were in Puerto Rico.
They wanted Puerto Rican music,

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:23.636
<i> Starsky & Hutch
was in a big revolt</i>

01:32:23.639 --> 01:32:25.139
in Bolivia in one show.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.370
They wanted Bolivian music.

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:39.591
In 1975, my father, in jest,
wrote a song called

01:32:39.588 --> 01:32:42.718
<i> Requiem For a Studio
 Guitar Player.</i>

01:32:56.038 --> 01:32:57.938
Always looking to carry
a joke a little further,

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:01.440
my dad dressed up
as a 280-pound ballerina

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:02.683
<i>and went on The Gong Show.</i>

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.150
You should think about
what he's saying

01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:14.915
in the lyrics to his song.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:17.723
Don't dwell on the costume
too much...

01:33:17.726 --> 01:33:20.056
because it tells a lot about
the way the business

01:33:20.062 --> 01:33:21.762
in this town works.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:24.663
And for being a person
with a sense of humor,

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:27.366
I think Tommy's
had to put up with

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:29.699
a lot of really stupid things.

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:50.459
It was not until I tracked
these musicians down

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:51.889
to tell their story

01:33:51.893 --> 01:33:55.733
that I fully understood
Frank Zappa's words.

01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:57.931
In 1992,
my father had a stroke

01:33:57.933 --> 01:34:02.203
that pretty much ended
his career as a guitarist.

01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:04.804
Two months before
my father passed away,

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:06.906
he said to me, "You know,
the stroke came

01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:09.208
at the right time
in my life."

01:34:09.211 --> 01:34:11.311
I knew exactly what he meant.

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:12.983
The phone had stopped ringing,

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.381
and his day as
the Los Angeles session king

01:34:15.384 --> 01:34:17.154
had come to an end.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:21.422
Now he had an excuse as to why
the phone didn't ring.

01:34:21.423 --> 01:34:25.533
It was something
he had no control over.

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:27.887
If I learned anything
from my father,

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:29.426
it was to give more
than you take.

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:30.931
He loved his family
and friends

01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:33.502
and would always help
the younger guitar players,

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:35.542
knowing it was only
a matter of time

01:34:35.537 --> 01:34:38.037
that they soon
would take his place,

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.170
just like he took someone else's
seat 40 years earlier.

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:46.246
mellow guitar chords)

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:43.499
Right on!

01:36:43.498 --> 01:36:50.368
Mariachi music)

01:37:08.857 --> 01:37:11.017
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

01:37:11.026 --> 01:37:14.486
With 30 points,
the winner today is...

01:37:14.496 --> 01:37:15.496
Hot dog!

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:17.757
...Tommy Tedesco!

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:35.761
What do you call
a trombone player

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:37.817
with a beeper?

01:41:37.826 --> 01:41:39.456
An optimist.
