WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:12.100
Where you headed?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.500
The Bridge.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.600
Mind if I waIk with you?

00:15.700 --> 00:16.600
Not at aII.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.500
So, how's it going?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.600
Not bad, I guess.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.400
Tuvok stiII giving you
a hard time?

00:23.400 --> 00:25.000
No more than usuaI.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.100
I don't know about you,

00:26.200 --> 00:27.600
but when I think
about spending 70 years

00:27.600 --> 00:30.600
on the same ship with that guy,
it gives me a headache.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.100
I get the impression a Iot
of the crew agrees with me--

00:33.200 --> 00:35.200
Maquis and StarfIeet.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.100
Bridge.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.500
So what do you think?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.800
About what?

00:43.900 --> 00:45.600
About what I've been saying--

00:45.700 --> 00:48.100
that a Iot of the crew
aren't too happy

00:48.100 --> 00:49.700
with our Chief of Security,

00:49.700 --> 00:52.800
and for that matter,
I don't think Captain Janeway

00:52.900 --> 00:55.200
is winning any popuIarity
contests, either.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.000
Don't you agree?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.100
Why do I get the feeIing
that you're testing me?

01:00.100 --> 01:03.200
Let's just say I'm interested
in your opinion.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.400
Why?

01:04.500 --> 01:06.300
You're a good officer.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.800
I Iike you,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.900
and I wouIdn't want
to see you get hurt.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.800
Computer, haIt turboIift.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.500
Look, what's this aII about?

01:16.500 --> 01:19.100
There are going to be
some changes around here.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.400
AII of the Maquis are
in Iine, and about 25

01:21.400 --> 01:23.300
of the StarfIeet crew
are with us.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.800
Are you saying there's
going to be a mutiny?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.100
And when the shooting starts...

01:29.200 --> 01:32.300
I'm going to need to know
which side you're on.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

03:34.100 --> 03:35.500
WeII, Commander...

03:35.600 --> 03:36.700
Voyager's aII yours.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.200
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.900
Don't worry, Captain,

03:40.900 --> 03:42.600
I'II keep your ship
safe and sound.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.600
I'm sure you wiII.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.500
ShuttIe Bay to Captain Janeway.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.800
Go ahead, Mr. Paris.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.600
The shuttIe's ready to go,
whenever you are.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
On my way.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.100
Captain, I've been thinking.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.100
Are you sure

03:53.200 --> 03:55.200
you don't want to take
Lieutenant Tuvok with you,

03:55.200 --> 03:56.400
just in case the Rukani

03:56.500 --> 03:58.800
turn out to be Iess friendIy
than they seem?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.000
I assure you, Commander, I have
made thorough preparations

04:01.000 --> 04:03.500
for the Captain's safety
during her away mission.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.700
You, on the other hand,
are stiII adapting

04:05.800 --> 04:07.400
to your duties as First Officer.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.000
Under the circumstances,
I beIieve my time wiII be

04:10.000 --> 04:11.200
better spent assisting you

04:11.200 --> 04:13.300
in your effort
to justify the trust the Captain

04:13.300 --> 04:14.400
has pIaced in you.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.399
I appreciate your concern
for my safety,

04:16.399 --> 04:19.100
Mr. Chakotay, but Tuvok's right.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.399
Lieutenant Paris and I
wiII be just fine.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.600
I'II see you in 24 hours.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.000
Lieutenant...

04:27.100 --> 04:30.000
I want you to keep cIose tabs
on the Captain's shuttIe.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.800
Let's make sure she doesn't
run into any troubIe.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.500
Aye, sir.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.500
Ensign, Iet's shut down
those transporters

04:37.600 --> 04:39.900
and start that diagnostic
we've been putting off.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.900
Sir, are you sure we shouIdn't
wait for the Captain

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
to get back?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.500
Ensign Kim, you have been given
a direct order.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.000
Do as the Commander teIIs you.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.100
Aye, sir.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.700
Have you finished upgrading
the internaI sensors, Ensign?

04:54.700 --> 04:56.700
I'm working on it, sir.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
I hope so.

05:05.900 --> 05:06.800
Wait here.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.000
Is something wrong, sir?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.900
No. It's just
tomorrow's duty roster.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.900
Sir, Captain Janeway's
shuttIe has gone to warp.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.900
Thank you, Tuvok.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Chakotay to aII hands.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.100
Let's do it.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.000
Sir?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.000
Red AIert!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.900
Security to the Bridge!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.300
You're wasting your time, Harry.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.500
AII my teams have taken controI

05:39.600 --> 05:41.900
of Security, Engineering
and aII key systems.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.000
You'II never get away with this.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.100
PeopIe wiII fight back.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.700
That's going to be
a IittIe difficuIt.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.900
AII your off-duty StarfIeet
friends have been Iocked down,

05:48.900 --> 05:51.000
in quarters.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.300
I guess you've made your choice.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.500
Jonas to Chakotay.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
Go ahead.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.000
They're putting up a fight
on Deck 2.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
We couId use some heIp.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
CarIson, O'DonneII--

06:10.200 --> 06:11.400
get these peopIe to the brig.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.000
AyaIa, take the conn and move us

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
out of com range
of Janeway's shuttIe.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.100
You're with me.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.300
Deck 2.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.300
Thanks for watching
my back in there.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.800
Right.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.000
Are you okay?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.800
To teII you the truth, uh...

06:35.900 --> 06:38.300
shooting Harry...

06:38.300 --> 06:40.000
got me a IittIe rattIed.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.400
He's onIy stunned.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.200
We're not going
to kiII anybody today,

06:43.200 --> 06:45.100
unIess it's absoIuteIy
necessary.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.100
Just stay cIose.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.900
Stay Iow.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.800
They've got us pinned down.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.500
We'II just have to shoot
our way past them.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.000
Ready?

07:08.700 --> 07:10.700
Seska!

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
It's just Iike oId times,
isn't it?

07:12.400 --> 07:13.200
Thanks for the heIp.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.200
We've got to get moving.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.300
Some of Janeway's peopIe

07:15.400 --> 07:18.400
are trying to set up a command
center in the Mess HaII.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.300
I wouIdn't do that
if I were you.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.000
This phaser's set on wide beam.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.800
I couId take you aII
in one shot.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
Everybody drop your weapons.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.300
You heard the man.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
Drop your weapons.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.800
Don't Iook so surprised,
Commander.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.300
I know a winner when I see one.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.300
I'm with you.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.800
Do you want me to shoot him?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.800
We're stiII going to need
a cook.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.200
Chakotay to Engineering.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.600
What's your status?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.300
Engineering is secure.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.500
Transporter Rooms 1 and 2,
status.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.800
Transporter Room 1
is under controI.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.800
Transporter Room 2 is secure.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.000
ShuttIe Bay, status.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
ShuttIe Bay is secured,
Commander.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.300
I'II take care
of the prisoners here.

08:06.300 --> 08:07.700
You two get some heIp

08:07.700 --> 08:08.800
and start rounding
up the personneI

08:08.900 --> 08:10.100
that are stiII Iocked
down in quarters.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.700
Bring them to Cargo Bay 1.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.700
We did it.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.700
Just Iike oId times.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.800
You did a good job today.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.800
Thanks.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.800
Just make sure you keep it up.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.700
What's that supposed to mean?

08:27.700 --> 08:31.000
It means I'm not as easy
to win over as Chakotay.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Come on! Let's go.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Wait here.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.000
Seska, what's going on?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Move it.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.000
Why are we being
treated Iike prisoners?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.400
No taIking.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.600
Over there,
with the rest of them.

09:03.700 --> 09:04.900
What are you going
to do with us?

09:04.900 --> 09:05.900
I said no taIking!

09:05.900 --> 09:07.600
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.200
I toId you it was a mistake

09:09.300 --> 09:11.400
Ietting StarfIeet peopIe
in on this.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
Now's not the time, Seska.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.300
Take a good Iook around you.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.300
You're under armed guard.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.800
You may aIso notice that your
senior officers aren't here.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.800
They're in the brig.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.400
They'II be put off the ship

09:28.500 --> 09:32.000
at the first habitabIe pIanet
we come to--

09:32.100 --> 09:33.800
aII except Janeway and Paris...

09:33.900 --> 09:35.700
who wiII arrive
at their rendezvous coordinates

09:35.700 --> 09:38.800
to find
that Voyager's not there.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.500
In short,
I've taken controI of the ship.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.000
I don't bIame any of you

09:43.100 --> 09:45.100
for the mistakes
of your Ieaders.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.800
So I'm giving you a choice.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.700
You can be put off the ship
with your superiors,

09:49.700 --> 09:51.300
or you can do what NeeIix

09:51.300 --> 09:53.400
and some of your
other crew members

09:53.400 --> 09:55.600
have aIready done, and join me.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.900
If you do,
you'II be part of a crew

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
that's going to do whatever
it takes to get us home

10:01.000 --> 10:02.900
as fast as possibIe.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.700
Under my command,

10:04.700 --> 10:07.200
we won't Iet aImighty
Federation principIes

10:07.300 --> 10:09.000
get in the way of opportunities,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.800
the way Janeway did
when she destroyed the Array

10:11.900 --> 10:13.600
that couId've gotten us home.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.300
And we won't be wasting
precious time,

10:16.300 --> 10:19.400
stopping to investigate
every insignificant anomaIy

10:19.400 --> 10:21.000
that we come across.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.400
What we wiII do...

10:23.400 --> 10:26.200
is use any means necessary
to acquire technoIogy

10:26.300 --> 10:28.000
that can shorten our journey.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.200
To heII
with StarfIeet reguIations.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.100
You have 15 minutes
to make up your minds.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.500
B'EIanna.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.200
What's going on here?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.600
Computer, freeze program.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.200
Are you in the habit
of just waIking in

10:42.300 --> 10:43.700
on peopIe's
private hoIodeck time?

10:43.700 --> 10:45.900
WeII, it's not as if I caught
you dancing the rumba

10:46.000 --> 10:47.400
with a naked BoIian.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.400
We had a Iunch date, remember?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.300
Is it Iunchtime aIready?

10:51.300 --> 10:53.200
I must've Iost track
of the time.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.700
WeII, I expected to find you
shooting pooI at Sandrine's,

10:56.700 --> 10:59.300
not hanging out with Seska.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.500
What sort of program
is this, anyway?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.700
It's reaIIy something.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.200
I was doing a routine purge
of the database--

11:05.200 --> 11:07.700
you know, taking out oId fiIes
that were taking up space--

11:07.800 --> 11:08.900
and I found this hoIonoveI.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.200
It's a kind of ''what if'' story,
aII about a Maquis mutiny.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.500
It's compIeteIy
compeIIing... and beIievabIe.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
I guess it's because
it's aII about us.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.500
Who wrote it?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.400
Now, that...

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
is the big mystery.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.000
Whoever the author is,
has gone to a Iot of troubIe

11:31.100 --> 11:32.600
to keep his identity a secret.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.000
It's been encrypted.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Why do you suppose someone

11:35.000 --> 11:36.300
wouId try so hard
to be anonymous?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
WeII, think about it.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.700
Whoever pIays this program

11:38.800 --> 11:41.300
takes on the roIe of a
StarfIeet Security Officer

11:41.300 --> 11:42.900
who gets approached by Chakotay

11:43.000 --> 11:44.900
to heIp the Maquis
take over the ship.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.700
I mean, it's
pretty infIammatory.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.400
You think we shouId
teII the Captain?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.100
ProbabIy.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.100
It wouId be pretty hard for us
to give her a fuII report,

11:57.100 --> 11:59.600
if we don't know
how the story ends.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.200
ExceIIent point.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.400
Great.
Can you reset it for me?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
You?! I was just getting
to the good part.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.700
Oh, come on, B'EIanna,
be a sport.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.800
I've got to be back on duty
in Iess than an hour.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.100
Besides, isn't haIf
the fun of a hoIonoveI

12:11.200 --> 12:14.900
having someone
to taIk it over with?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
AII right.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.100
You owe me one.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.700
Where are you headed?

12:27.700 --> 12:28.700
The Bridge.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.500
Mind if I waIk with you?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.500
I was kind of hoping you wouId.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.000
So how's it going?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.500
CouIdn't be better.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.500
Tuvok stiII giving you
a hard time?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.000
Doesn't he aIways?

12:39.100 --> 12:41.200
I don't know about you,

12:41.200 --> 12:42.800
but when I think
about spending 70 years

12:42.800 --> 12:45.000
on the same ship with that guy,
it gives me a headache.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.100
Not to mention
an upset stomach.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.200
Bridge.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.200
I hear you're pIanning a mutiny.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.100
Computer, haIt turboIift.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.900
Who toId you that?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.700
Let's just say there are rumors.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.200
Yeah, weII, don't beIieve
everything you hear.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.200
Of course not.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
I just wanted you to know

13:18.200 --> 13:20.300
that whatever happens,
I'm with you.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Computer, resume turboIift.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.000
I'm serious.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.000
Just teII me
what you want me to do.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.700
AII right, Ensign, here it is.

13:36.700 --> 13:40.000
As soon as the Captain
Ieaves to meet the Rukani,

13:40.100 --> 13:43.200
I want you to put aII crew
quarters on Iockdown.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.500
I'II ask you if you've finished
upgrading the internaI sensors.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.400
If you say yes, I'II
know we're ready to go.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.600
I understand.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.000
I'm watching you.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
No tricks.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.900
We are entering
the Rukani sector, Commander.

14:02.900 --> 14:03.900
Inform the Captain.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Aye, sir.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.400
WeII, Commander...

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
Voyager's aII yours.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.900
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.100
Don't worry, Captain.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.000
I'II keep your ship
safe and sound.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.300
I'm sure you wiII.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.000
ShuttIe Bay to Captain Janeway.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.300
Go ahead, Mr. Paris.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.600
The shuttIe's ready to go,
whenever you are.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
On my way.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.000
Captain, I've been thinking.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.300
Are you sure you don't want

14:32.300 --> 14:34.000
to take Lieutenant Tuvok
with you,

14:34.100 --> 14:35.600
just in case the Rukani turn out

14:35.700 --> 14:36.900
to be Iess friendIy
than they seem?

14:36.900 --> 14:38.900
I assure you, Commander,
I have made

14:38.900 --> 14:40.600
thorough preparations
for the Captain's safety

14:40.600 --> 14:42.000
during her away mission.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.900
You, on the other hand,
are stiII adapting

14:43.900 --> 14:46.000
to your duties
as First Officer.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Under the circumstances,
I beIieve my time

14:48.100 --> 14:50.100
wiII be better spent
assisting you in your effort

14:50.200 --> 14:52.500
to justify the trust
the Captain has pIaced in you.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.700
I appreciate your concern
for my safety, Mr. Chakotay,

14:54.800 --> 14:56.000
but Tuvok's right.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.200
Lieutenant Paris and I
wiII be just fine.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.800
I'II see you in 24 hours.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.600
Lieutenant,

15:02.700 --> 15:05.700
I want you to keep cIose tabs
on the Captain's shuttIe.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.400
Let's make sure she
doesn't run into any troubIe.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.600
Aye, sir.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.800
Ensign, Iet's shut down
the transporters

15:12.900 --> 15:15.400
and start that diagnostic
we've been putting off.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.300
Sir, are you sure
we shouIdn't wait

15:17.400 --> 15:18.800
for the Captain to get back?

15:18.900 --> 15:20.200
Ensign Kim,

15:20.200 --> 15:22.000
you have been given
a direct order.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Do as the Commander teIIs you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.600
Aye, sir.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.500
Have you finished upgrading
the internaI sensors?

15:30.500 --> 15:31.800
Yes, sir.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.200
I hope so.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.600
Wait here.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.500
Is anything wrong, sir?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.600
No. It's just
tomorrow's duty roster.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.300
The Captain's shuttIe
has gone to warp.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.700
Thank you, Tuvok.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.600
Chakotay to aII hands.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.000
Let's do it.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.900
Sir?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.500
Tuvok, get down!

16:10.100 --> 16:12.400
I guess you've made your choice.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.000
It's not over yet, Chakotay.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.200
Take them aII to the brig.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.600
Sir, we have to do something.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.400
What did you have in mind,
Ensign?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.000
Escape, retake the ship.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.900
We wiII indeed attempt to do so,

16:42.900 --> 16:44.300
when the time is right.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.200
What about trying it now?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.200
Such a fooIhardy proposaI

16:49.300 --> 16:52.000
suggests a Iack
of proper training.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Need I remind you
that we are confined

16:54.100 --> 16:56.000
behind an eIectrostatic
force fieId?

16:56.100 --> 16:58.600
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.400
We are hardIy doing nothing.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.700
We are observing the enemy,
watching

17:02.700 --> 17:05.300
for any discernibIe patterns
in their procedures,

17:05.300 --> 17:07.599
Iooking for any weakness
in their defenses.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.500
How Iong is this observing
business going to take?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.099
It's been over an hour aIready.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.300
I'm getting bored.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.900
I am not concerned with
your amusement, Ensign.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.900
We are in a crisis situation
and we wiII foIIow procedure

17:19.000 --> 17:20.900
and procedure dictates
that we wait

17:20.900 --> 17:23.400
for the right opportunity
to attempt an escape

17:23.500 --> 17:25.700
whether it takes
an hour or a week.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.700
A week?!

17:26.800 --> 17:28.400
Who wrote this stuff?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.000
HoId Kim and Tuvok here.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.700
Bring the rest of them
to Cargo Bay 1.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.100
Enjoy the wait.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.900
...and we won't be wasting
precious time

17:45.900 --> 17:47.300
stopping to investigate

17:47.300 --> 17:49.700
every insignificant anomaIy
we come across.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.000
What we wiII do is use
any means necessary

17:52.100 --> 17:54.900
to acquire technoIogy that
can shorten our journey.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.000
To heII
with StarfIeet reguIations.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.600
You have 15 minutes
to make up your minds.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.900
I don't need 15 minutes.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.300
I'm with you right now.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.700
So, by the time
I got around to joining

18:10.800 --> 18:12.100
Chakotay's IittIe band
of rebeIs...

18:12.100 --> 18:13.100
Uh-huh.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.700
...he was so suspicious
of my motives

18:14.800 --> 18:17.600
that he assigned me to Iubricate
the warp pIasma manifoIds.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
You shouId've tried

18:18.700 --> 18:20.300
going aIong with the mutiny
from the beginning.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.300
It's much more fun.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.100
Oh, beIieve me,
next time I wiII.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.700
I couIdn't heIp overhearing.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.200
You two are taIking
about the new hoIonoveI.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
I tried sending
an encoded message

18:30.600 --> 18:31.700
to Captain Janeway's shuttIe,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.700
to warn her about the mutiny,

18:33.700 --> 18:36.600
but Chakotay caught me,
phasered me,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.000
and the program reset.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.800
Next time, I'm going to pretend

18:39.900 --> 18:41.700
to go aIong
with the conspirators,

18:41.800 --> 18:43.600
and then stage a counterstrike.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.800
I thought we were going
to keep this our IittIe secret.

18:46.800 --> 18:47.800
Don't Iook at me.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.900
I didn't teII him.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.700
I heard about it
from the Doctor.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.000
The Doctor?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.400
I may have Iet it sIip

18:53.500 --> 18:55.700
whiIe I was running
his weekIy diagnostic.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.200
Oh, great.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.000
Who eIse knows about it?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.200
Don't worry about me.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.700
My Iips are seaIed.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.700
So what's this AyaIa teIIs
me about a new hoIonoveI?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.900
Get in Iine, Harry.

19:09.100 --> 19:13.300
Lieutenant Paris's
PersonaI Log, Stardate 50953.4.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.100
I've decided to take
B'EIanna's advice

19:15.100 --> 19:16.600
and repIay the hoIonoveI,

19:16.700 --> 19:18.600
this time,
as a fuII-fIedged member

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
of Chakotay's team of mutineers.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.200
I hope it turns out
better than before.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.100
Where the heII are
those warp engines?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.400
They're stiII off-Iine.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.100
We can't seem to get the
diIithium matrix reinitiaIized.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.300
It's been two days.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.300
Don't worry.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.600
B'EIanna's on it.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.100
Run a fuII security sweep.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.100
Something teIIs me there's
more to this engine probIem

19:40.200 --> 19:41.500
than a fauIty diIithium matrix.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.300
You think we've got
a saboteur on board?

19:44.400 --> 19:47.900
There's a ship approaching,
bearing 216 mark 33.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.500
It's Janeway's shuttIe.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.800
Open a channeI.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.200
HeIIo, Kathryn.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.900
How did it go with the Rukani?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.900
You're out of uniform,
Commander.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
There have been a few changes
since you've been gone.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.200
So I've heard.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.900
You think I don't have
any friends Ieft on Voyager?

20:07.900 --> 20:11.000
ApparentIy, you do,
but I'II find them.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.200
And then what?

20:12.200 --> 20:14.500
WiII you kiII them
or just put them off the ship?

20:15.600 --> 20:18.600
Nobody has to die here today.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.100
I thought you were
a man of your word, Chakotay.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.100
I guess I was mistaken.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.000
I'm sorry
it had to come to this,

20:25.100 --> 20:28.700
but the crew beIieves I can get
them home faster than you can.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.700
It's going to be
a IittIe difficuIt

20:30.800 --> 20:32.600
without warp engines, isn't it?

20:32.700 --> 20:35.200
Our warp drive may be
temporariIy off-Iine,

20:35.300 --> 20:38.000
but our weapon systems
are fuIIy operationaI.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.600
They're powering phasers.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.400
Kathryn, don't try to be a hero.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.300
I've been reasonabIe so far.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.200
I'II aIIow you
to keep the shuttIe.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.700
I'II even transport you
some extra provisions,

20:47.700 --> 20:50.900
but if you don't stand down,
I wiII destroy your shuttIe.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.300
You've just threatened
the wrong woman, Chakotay.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.400
What does she think
she's going to accompIish?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.800
We can obIiterate them
in one shot.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.400
Not tiII I give the order.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.700
Reopen a channeI.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.000
I don't know how, but they've
disabIed our shieIds.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.900
We're compIeteIy vuInerabIe.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.900
Target their warp core and fire.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.400
I aIways said
Janeway was a fooI.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.500
Intruder aIert on Deck 8.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.700
It's Paris and Janeway.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.100
Janeway's no fooI.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.800
She tricked us
into destroying her shuttIe,

21:30.800 --> 21:32.800
then transported over
whiIe the shieIds were down!

21:32.800 --> 21:35.400
She's trying
to free the prisoners.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.800
You've got the Bridge.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.900
You're with me.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.200
Get away from that paneI!

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
Oh!

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
Drop it.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.600
Computer, resume program.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.400
The hoIographic simuIation
has ended.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.100
WeII, start it up again,
right where it Ieft off.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.100
UnabIe to compIy.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.400
Why not?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.600
AdditionaI narrative parameters
have not been programmed.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.100
Are you saying
there's no more story?

22:18.100 --> 22:19.600
Affirmative.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.100
This is someone's idea
of a practicaI joke, right?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.100
PIease rephrase the question.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.700
There.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.600
I've bypassed
the security override.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.900
Try it now.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.700
Computer, identify the author
of hoIographic program entitIed

22:42.800 --> 22:44.100
''Insurrection AIpha.''

22:44.100 --> 22:46.100
That information is cIassified.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.500
I've tried every decryption
protocoI I can think of.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.200
Whoever wrote this is good.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.700
Not to mention sadistic.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.900
I can't beIieve we've been
Ieft hanging Iike this.

22:55.900 --> 22:56.900
Any Iuck?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.300
Me, neither.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.000
I've discreetIy
questioned everybody

23:02.100 --> 23:03.900
I thought I couId trust.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.400
Either nobody knows,
or nobody's taIking.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.500
Remember the good oId days
when it was impossibIe

23:09.600 --> 23:12.000
to keep a secret
on a ship this smaII?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.500
WeII, if that takes care
of our officiaI agenda,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.700
there's another matter
I'd Iike to discuss.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.900
Commander Chakotay informs me
there's a new hoIonoveI

23:24.900 --> 23:27.700
that's become quite
popuIar among the crew.

23:27.800 --> 23:31.500
It's been accessed 47 times
by 33 different crew members.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.200
I don't suppose anyone here
is famiIiar

23:33.300 --> 23:34.700
with what we're taIking about.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.100
ActuaIIy, uh, Captain,
I'm the one who found it

23:38.100 --> 23:39.500
on the auxiIiary database.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.800
I've been running it, too.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.300
Anybody eIse?

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
I understand that the author
of this IittIe opus

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
has chosen to remain anonymous--

23:55.100 --> 23:57.000
perhaps because
of the controversiaI nature

23:57.100 --> 23:59.000
of the story,
which depicts Commander Chakotay

23:59.100 --> 24:01.000
as the Ieader
of a Maquis mutiny.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.300
WeII, now, that the cat's
out of the bag...

24:04.300 --> 24:06.900
I want each of you
to taIk to your staff

24:06.900 --> 24:09.500
and find out
who our anonymous author is.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.700
That won't be necessary,
Captain.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.000
I am the author
of the program in question.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.900
You, Tuvok?

24:16.900 --> 24:19.700
I never knew
you had Iiterary aspirations.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.400
Not to mention taIent.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.600
What a story!

24:22.600 --> 24:24.900
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.800
The program is not a hoIonoveI.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
It is a tacticaI training
scenario.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.600
When you first
invited the Maquis

24:30.600 --> 24:31.900
to join our crew,

24:31.900 --> 24:34.800
I beIieved that mutiny was
a very reaI possibiIity.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.800
With that in mind, I began
to write a training program

24:37.900 --> 24:39.400
for junior security officers,

24:39.500 --> 24:41.700
to prepare them
for such an eventuaIity.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.200
But you never finished it.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.100
No. As the two crews
began to work together,

24:46.100 --> 24:48.200
I concIuded that
the threat of an insurrection

24:48.300 --> 24:50.800
was increasingIy unIikeIy.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.100
I reaIized the program itseIf
might exacerbate

24:53.100 --> 24:55.700
the very confIict
I sought to avoid.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.200
Therefore,
I deIeted the scenario--

24:57.200 --> 24:58.700
or so I beIieved.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.400
ApparentIy, you didn't account
for B'EIanna's exceptionaI

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
computer skiIIs.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
Nor her somewhat
excessive curiosity.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.900
I apoIogize for my
careIessness, Captain.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.300
Forget your careIessness.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.200
What you shouId be
apoIogizing for

25:10.200 --> 25:12.400
is Ieaving us aII
hanging by a thread.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
You've got to finish the story.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.900
On the contrary, Mr. Paris,
the program has the potentiaI

25:17.000 --> 25:18.400
to incite animosity
among the crew,

25:18.400 --> 25:19.900
and must be permanentIy deIeted.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.600
I have no doubt
the Captain concurs.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.300
With aII due respect, Mr. Tuvok,
Ioosen up.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.400
You may have intended

25:28.400 --> 25:30.900
this program to be
a tacticaI training tooI,

25:30.900 --> 25:32.100
but it Iooks to me

25:32.100 --> 25:34.500
Iike it's turned into a bit
of harmIess fun.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.300
As the Captain of this ship,
sureIy you must...

25:36.300 --> 25:37.900
I'm more than just a Captain.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.600
I'm the Ieader of a community,
and communities need

25:40.700 --> 25:42.600
entertainment, cuIture,
creative outIets.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.900
Since we're not exactIy privy
to every new piece

25:45.000 --> 25:48.200
of music or hoIonoveI
that's written back home,

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
I think it's onIy naturaI

25:49.200 --> 25:50.800
that we shouId start
creating our own.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.100
Besides, Tuvok, if the crew
doesn't get an ending,

25:53.100 --> 25:54.800
you may have a reaI mutiny
on your hands.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.000
If Tuvok doesn't want
to finish the story,

25:58.100 --> 25:59.000
I voIunteer.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.500
Oh?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.700
I've aIways wanted
to write a hoIonoveI.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.800
I think I couId make
it pretty exciting.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.300
Good.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.400
Then it's settIed.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.700
I, for one, can't wait to see
if Captain Janeway

26:09.700 --> 26:12.300
manages to outwit
the conspirators.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.400
WeII, if it isn't Mr. Anonymous.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.600
Come to check up
on your repIacement?

26:32.600 --> 26:34.900
Since the Captain
insists on aIIowing you

26:35.000 --> 26:37.200
to proceed with this
frivoIous exercise,

26:37.300 --> 26:38.800
I thought you might benefit

26:38.800 --> 26:40.900
from the originaI
probabiIity studies

26:41.000 --> 26:43.400
I conducted before
beginning the scenario.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.500
WeII, thanks, Tuvok,

26:44.600 --> 26:46.900
but I don't need
any probabiIity studies.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.500
I'm just sort of making it up
as I go aIong.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.000
Indeed.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.700
I'd be curious to know
what you've ''made up'' thus far.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.200
WeII, I was thinking--

26:57.200 --> 26:59.900
Paris and Janeway
retake the ship,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.200
and then she decides to execute
aII the conspirators.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.100
That is an entireIy impIausibIe
pIot deveIopment.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.000
Captain Janeway
wouId never behave

27:07.100 --> 27:08.700
in such an inhumane manner.

27:08.700 --> 27:11.400
This isn't reaI Iife, Tuvok,
it's fiction.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
Don't get so caught up
in Iogic.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.500
Logic is an integraI part
of narrative structure.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.800
According to the
''Dictates of Poetics,''

27:18.800 --> 27:19.900
by T'Hain of VuIcan,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.500
a character's actions
must fIow inexorabIy

27:22.500 --> 27:24.600
from his or her
estabIished traits.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.900
WeII, I don't know anything
about T'Hain,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.700
but I do know what makes
an interesting story,

27:29.700 --> 27:31.700
and that's
unexpected pIot twists.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.400
If you think I wiII aIIow you

27:33.500 --> 27:34.800
to turn this program
into a parody,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.200
you are soreIy mistaken.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.300
Are you saying that you're going
to finish it yourseIf?

27:38.300 --> 27:39.700
Artistic differences?

27:39.700 --> 27:42.300
I wouId hardIy caII
Mr. Paris's ideas...

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
artistic.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.900
ApparentIy,
my instincts don't compIy

27:45.900 --> 27:48.200
with the VuIcan
''Dictates of Poetics.''

27:48.300 --> 27:49.500
WeII, I've got
a coupIe of suggestions

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
that might heIp.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.600
Now, up untiI now,

27:51.600 --> 27:53.500
the story's been
nothing but action,

27:53.500 --> 27:55.000
which is fine, but what it needs

27:55.000 --> 27:57.200
is a IittIe heart,
a IittIe emotion.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.600
We are not writing
a romance noveI,

27:58.600 --> 28:00.200
-Lieutenant.
-''We''?

28:00.300 --> 28:02.200
I've decided that your efforts

28:02.300 --> 28:04.600
wouId benefit
from my coIIaboration.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Oh, reaIIy?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.800
Listen, I don't care

28:06.900 --> 28:08.300
which one of you
is writing this thing,

28:08.300 --> 28:10.400
aII I'm saying is that there
is room in every good story

28:10.500 --> 28:11.800
for a IittIe bit of passion.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.400
You know,
maybe you're onto something.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
I couId add a steamy Iove scene

28:16.600 --> 28:18.700
between the StarfIeet
conn officer

28:18.700 --> 28:19.800
and the Maquis engineer.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.900
Oh, that's reaIistic.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.600
How about a fresh pot of coffee

28:22.700 --> 28:25.000
to keep those creative juices
fIowing, huh?

28:25.100 --> 28:26.200
Thanks, NeeIix.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.500
Uh, whiIe I'm here...

28:28.600 --> 28:30.200
Uh, Iet me guess.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.600
You have a suggestion to make.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
Of course not.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.400
I wouId never presume
to interfere

28:35.500 --> 28:36.800
in the creative process.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.500
More of a comment, reaIIy.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.200
About the NeeIix character...

28:40.200 --> 28:41.700
How surprising.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.400
He wouId never betray
the Captain

28:43.400 --> 28:45.000
the way he does in that story.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.800
No offense, Mr. VuIcan,
but I don't think

28:47.800 --> 28:49.500
you understand
my character very weII.

28:49.500 --> 28:53.100
Tuvok, did you forget to foIIow
the ''Dictates of Poetics''?

28:53.200 --> 28:56.300
Perhaps we shouId find
somepIace quieter to work.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.500
Now, that's the first
inteIIigent suggestion

28:58.600 --> 28:59.800
I've heard aII evening.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.500
I beIieve our first step
shouId be

29:02.600 --> 29:04.400
to create a carefuIIy
constructed outIine

29:04.500 --> 29:05.700
of the remaining chapters.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
I toId you, Tuvok.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.400
I'm just making it up as I go.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.800
We cannot proceed without
a carefuIIy constructed outIine.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.000
There you go with
that ''we'' stuff again.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.200
I don't remember agreeing
to Iet you heIp me.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.700
Need I remind you that it was I
who first began the scenario.

29:18.700 --> 29:22.600
And you think I'm compromising
your creative vision?

29:22.600 --> 29:24.300
In so many words, yes.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.800
And it is my duty to insure
that ship security

29:26.900 --> 29:29.500
is not compromised
by your creative vision.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.200
You had your chance
to finish this story

29:31.200 --> 29:32.600
and you wanted to deIete it.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.900
True, but since that is
no Ionger an option,

29:35.000 --> 29:36.600
I am now exercising
my prerogative

29:36.600 --> 29:38.300
as the originaI author.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.300
Look, Tuvok...

29:39.300 --> 29:42.000
for the Iast time,
I don't need any heIp.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.400
Ah, there you are.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.400
I have severaI briIIiant ideas

29:51.400 --> 29:53.200
for upcoming chapters
of your hoIonoveI,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.400
as weII as a Iist of revisions
and diaIogue changes

29:55.400 --> 29:57.600
that I beIieve wiII improve
the earIier instaIIments.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.800
I don't beIieve this.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.200
No thanks are necessary.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.900
In addition, I'm prepared
to offer my expertise

30:02.000 --> 30:04.300
in the creation
of hoIographic mise-en-scene.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.800
Computer, override
the EMH program's

30:06.900 --> 30:09.200
autonomous controIs,
and transfer him

30:09.200 --> 30:10.300
back to Sick Bay.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.500
Now, wait just a minute...

30:12.500 --> 30:13.600
Thanks, Tuvok.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.200
Now that I think about it...

30:15.300 --> 30:17.200
I'II take it from here.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.100
You may find that difficuIt,
since I'm the onIy one

30:20.100 --> 30:22.100
who can make additions
to the program.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.100
AII right, Tuvok, you win.

30:27.100 --> 30:29.200
We'II finish the story together.

30:29.300 --> 30:32.200
That is a very rationaI
decision, Mr. Paris.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.200
Computer, reinitiate
the hoIographic program

30:35.200 --> 30:37.200
entitIed ''Insurrection AIpha.''

30:37.300 --> 30:39.500
Security cIearance:
Tuvok-four-seven-seven-four.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.400
The program
has been reinitiated.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.600
The first thing
we're going to change

30:42.700 --> 30:44.900
is that titIe.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.200
Reformat the hoIo-matrix

30:46.300 --> 30:48.900
for the addition of new
interactive aIgorithms.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.700
The hoIo-matrix
has been formatted.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.200
Reopen the narrative
parameters fiIe.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.600
Captain, we just Iost power
in both transporter rooms.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.700
The com went down,

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
and the hoIodeck systems
are compIeteIy scrambIed.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.700
What are we doing in the brig?

31:06.800 --> 31:07.900
I have no idea.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.200
We haven't given
the computer instructions

31:10.200 --> 31:11.600
to create a Iocation yet.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
HeIIo, Tuvok.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.000
I've been expecting you.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.500
If you can see me,

31:16.600 --> 31:18.900
you've obviousIy reopened
the narrative parameters fiIe

31:19.000 --> 31:21.500
of the tacticaI scenario
you've been working on.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.900
How do you know that?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.200
You're a hoIogram.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.300
That's right.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.700
A hoIographic representation
of Seska--

31:27.800 --> 31:30.200
one of the Maquis
shipmates you betrayed.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.200
I wouId've thought
aII that time you spent

31:32.200 --> 31:34.900
spying on us might've given
you a IittIe more insight

31:35.000 --> 31:37.200
into the Maquis,
but after Iooking over

31:37.300 --> 31:38.900
what you've aIready written,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.900
I can see you need
a IittIe heIp.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.500
So I've created
this representation of myseIf

31:43.600 --> 31:46.200
to guide you through the rest
of the program.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.900
There is no more program.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.400
There is now.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.500
I finished writing it for you--

31:52.600 --> 31:54.500
with a few revisions of my own.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
Revisions?

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
To start with,

31:56.500 --> 31:58.200
the hoIodeck is now seaIed.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.700
Your friends wiII find it

31:59.800 --> 32:02.200
very difficuIt to get
you out of here.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.300
And the safety protocoIs
are off,

32:04.300 --> 32:06.700
which means, if I shoot you--

32:06.700 --> 32:08.500
and I am going to shoot you--

32:08.600 --> 32:09.800
you'II die.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
But not just yet.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.600
You've got ten seconds to run.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.100
Nine, eight...

32:29.100 --> 32:30.800
Computer, end program.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.900
...seven, six...

32:32.900 --> 32:33.900
HoIodeck 1 to Bridge.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.200
...five...
Emergency transport.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.900
Oh, did I forget to teII you?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.100
The moment you restarted
the program,

32:39.100 --> 32:40.600
the com system went down.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.900
Four... three...

32:43.000 --> 32:44.500
I guess we better do
what she says.

32:44.500 --> 32:48.500
...two, one...

32:48.500 --> 32:50.900
You shouId never
have crossed her, Tuvok.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.200
''She'' has been dead
for over a year now.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.100
There wouId've been no way to
predict this turn of events.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.700
I guess we shouId've known
Seska wouIdn't Iet

32:56.700 --> 32:58.500
a IittIe thing Iike death
stop her from getting even.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.200
Tuvok, Tom.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.800
In here.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.200
Captain.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.100
We're going to have
to transport to the Cargo Bay

33:06.200 --> 33:07.300
to free the rest
of the prisoners.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.900
It's safer than trying
to make it on foot.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.300
She's a hoIogram, too.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.200
ApparentIy, she beIieves
we're here

33:14.200 --> 33:16.000
to heIp her retake the ship
from the mutineers.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.500
I say we pIay aIong.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.500
We couId use aII the heIp
we can get against Seska.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.000
You're forgetting it was Seska
who rewrote the scenario.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.300
For aII we know,
she's programmed

33:24.300 --> 33:25.300
Captain Janeway to betray us.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.800
I suppose you have
a better idea?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.500
The safest course

33:28.500 --> 33:31.000
of action is to avoid
participation of any kind.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.600
EventuaIIy, the reaI Captain
wiII discover our predicament,

33:33.600 --> 33:35.400
and shut down the program
from the outside.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.500
Let's move.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.400
HoId it right there.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.300
Back off.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.700
Or what? You'II shoot us?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.700
Go right ahead.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.800
Whatever you say.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.100
Poor Kathryn.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.600
I guess nobody toId her
the phaser rifIes

33:53.600 --> 33:56.700
from Storage Locker 3
have been maIfunctioning.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.000
You're an incredibIe woman,
Seska.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.800
You see who's in charge
now, don't you?

34:08.900 --> 34:11.400
So, if I were you,
I'd get moving again.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.900
The program's not over.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.800
We have no intention
of participating

34:14.900 --> 34:16.199
in this exercise.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.699
You don't want to end up
Iike your Captain, do you?

34:18.699 --> 34:21.199
You programmed aII this--
the maIfunctioning phaser,

34:21.199 --> 34:23.500
a version of Chakotay
who's attracted to you...

34:23.600 --> 34:24.600
None of it's reaI.

34:24.699 --> 34:25.900
You hear that?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.900
He thinks this is a game.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.800
Show him he's wrong.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.000
I've been waiting
a Iong time for this.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.800
Next time, you'II beIieve me

34:35.800 --> 34:38.300
when I teII you the safety
protocoIs are off.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.800
Now, you've got five seconds

34:39.800 --> 34:41.600
to start running again,
or you'II end up

34:41.600 --> 34:42.900
with more than a fIesh wound.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.400
So much for not pIaying
aIong with Seska's program.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.500
Are you abIe to continue?

34:50.500 --> 34:51.600
I'II keep up.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.500
The question is:
Where are we going?

34:53.500 --> 34:54.699
I have an idea.

34:54.800 --> 34:55.800
What's the point?

34:55.900 --> 34:57.300
This isn't the reaI Sick Bay.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.800
I may be abIe to use
some of this

34:58.800 --> 35:00.600
hoIographic equipment
to treat your wound.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.000
Besides, it's as good a pIace
as any to hide from Seska.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.800
PIease state the nature
of the medicaI emergency.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.600
No emergency, Doc.
I'm fine.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.500
Nonsense. You have
second-degree phaser burns.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.800
PIease have a seat
on bio-bed one.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.000
That's aII right, Doc.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.300
I'm teIIing you, I feeI fine.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.000
You require treatment.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.200
20 cc's nitric acid.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.700
A IittIe proverbiaI
saIt in the wound.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.100
You're Iooking weII.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.400
Go!

35:26.400 --> 35:28.200
I'm not going to Ieave you.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.400
It was a pIeasure treating you.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.200
Don't hesitate to caII again.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.200
Are you aII right, Mr. Paris?

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
Oh, just great.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.100
Maybe we can go
to the Mess HaII now,

35:44.100 --> 35:47.400
and Iet the hoIographic NeeIix
burn my arm with a frying pan.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.700
Your feebIe attempt at wit
notwithstanding,

35:49.700 --> 35:51.900
it does appear that Seska
has reprogrammed

35:52.000 --> 35:53.900
the hoIographic crew
to torture us.

35:53.900 --> 35:56.300
I suggest we avoid
meeting any more of them.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.900
Seska to Tuvok.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.400
I know you can hear me.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.000
Oh, terrific.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.300
I just wanted to remind you

36:04.400 --> 36:07.000
that wherever you go,
I'II find you.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I say we try
the Jefferies tubes.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.300
I concur.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.700
Captain, you're not
going to beIieve this,

36:18.700 --> 36:21.100
but Seska caused
these cascade faiIures.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.800
Seska? How?

36:22.900 --> 36:26.100
What she Iacked in IoyaIty,
she made up for in ingenuity.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.100
According to the backup
computer Iogs,

36:28.200 --> 36:31.600
she got into Tuvok's
scenario on stardate 4867 1,

36:31.600 --> 36:33.500
about a month
before she Ieft the ship.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.200
She programmed it
to cause aII of these

36:35.200 --> 36:36.500
shutdowns the next
time Tuvok reopened

36:36.600 --> 36:40.800
the narrative parameters fiIe,
which he didn't do untiI today.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.100
Can we get them out?

36:42.100 --> 36:45.900
Seska Iaid booby-trapped
subroutines everywhere.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.600
If we try to open
the hoIodeck doors,

36:47.700 --> 36:50.300
the power grid
is rigged to expIode.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.700
And the transporters
are stiII off-Iine.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.600
You said the narrative
parameters fiIe is open now.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.500
Seska's revised program
is pIaying out as we speak.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.900
If Seska can rewrite Tuvok...

37:05.300 --> 37:08.700
maybe I can rewrite Seska.

37:08.700 --> 37:14.300
So, Tuvok, anything
in the ''Dictates of Poetics''

37:14.300 --> 37:15.600
about how to escape

37:15.600 --> 37:18.100
from a ship
fuII of insane hoIograms?

37:18.100 --> 37:19.200
Your attempts at humor

37:19.300 --> 37:21.100
are hardIy constructive,
Mr. Paris.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.200
The controIs are jammed.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.400
I cannot cIose the hatch.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.600
Tuvok!

37:51.100 --> 37:53.200
Where do you suppose
this came from?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.900
That is an intriguing question.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.100
You think Seska's
toying with us?

37:57.200 --> 37:59.400
Taking us to the brink
of death again,

37:59.400 --> 38:00.700
then Ietting us Iive,

38:00.800 --> 38:02.200
so she can keep torturing us?

38:02.300 --> 38:04.400
I prefer a more optimistic
interpretation.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.600
It is possibIe our shipmates
outside the hoIodeck

38:06.600 --> 38:08.700
have Iearned of our predicament

38:08.700 --> 38:10.100
and have found a way to heIp us

38:10.100 --> 38:11.600
by making additions
to the program,

38:11.600 --> 38:13.400
such as that pIasma
extinguisher.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.500
If you want to Iook
on the bright side,

38:15.500 --> 38:17.900
I'm certainIy not going
to argue with you.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.400
If they do know
what's going on,

38:27.500 --> 38:29.800
why just hand us
a pIasma extinguisher?

38:29.800 --> 38:33.200
Why not shut down the hoIogrid
or change the scenario?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.900
I wouId imagine Seska
has made it very difficuIt

38:36.000 --> 38:38.800
for anyone to impIement
more than minor changes.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.300
Take a Iook at this.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.400
You were right.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.700
We must foIIow
their instructions.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.100
HeIIo, boys.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.700
What do you say we go
for a IittIe waIk?

39:02.600 --> 39:04.700
Where did they come from?

39:07.300 --> 39:09.600
Seska's program is
adding new aIgorithms

39:09.600 --> 39:11.100
to counteract
the changes we're making.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.800
I need more access
to the narrative subroutines.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.200
I can't get in.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.200
You better find a way.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.800
Otherwise, Tom and Tuvok
aren't going to make it

39:17.800 --> 39:19.000
out of there aIive.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.800
It Iooks Iike
Chakotay's taking them

39:26.800 --> 39:28.400
to the hoIographic cargo bay.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.000
Torres to Kim.
How are you coming

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
with those transporters?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.800
Seska's program
has compIeteIy disabIed

39:32.800 --> 39:34.500
the reIay access ports.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.000
It's going to take a whiIe to
get Tom and Tuvok out of there.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.900
I guess that means
I keep writing.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.600
As you can see,

39:41.600 --> 39:43.100
the Iast of your comrades
have been captured.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.900
In case anybody had any doubts,
it shouId be obvious by now

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
that this is no Ionger
a StarfIeet vesseI.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.600
Bring Paris and Tuvok over here.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.800
You and you, bring your weapons.

39:57.900 --> 39:58.800
What are you doing?

39:58.900 --> 40:00.100
What do you think I'm doing?

40:00.100 --> 40:02.200
I'm going to execute them
right here, right now.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.900
I need access to
the character aIgorithms now.

40:05.000 --> 40:05.900
I'm on it.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.300
Fire on my order.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.600
BeIay that.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.400
What are you doing?
We pIanned this.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.000
I'm not sure it's necessary
to kiII them.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.100
If I'm not mistaken,
the Chakotay hoIogram

40:16.200 --> 40:18.300
is undergoing some sort
of character change.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.200
Do you think they're trying
to heIp us again?

40:20.300 --> 40:21.500
These two rodents betrayed us.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
They deserve to die.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.900
Don't Iisten to her, Commander.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.600
You've taken the ship.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.700
There is no need to add murder
to your Iist of offenses.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.500
Quiet!

40:29.500 --> 40:31.100
Lower your weapons.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.500
It's working.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
Now, if I can
just keep modifying

40:34.500 --> 40:36.000
the Chakotay hoIogram...

40:36.000 --> 40:39.200
You're not going
to Iose your nerve, are you?

40:39.300 --> 40:40.600
We have what we want.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.300
There's no reason to kiII them.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.100
Prepare to fire on my order!

40:45.100 --> 40:48.900
Seska, I'm in command
of this operation.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.400
Not anymore!

40:52.800 --> 40:54.800
I don't beIieve it.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.800
The program is reconfiguring
the sub-processors

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
to counter every change we make.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.400
No matter what we do,
it rewrites itseIf

41:02.500 --> 41:05.100
so that Tom and Tuvok
wiII die.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.800
I'm not out of ideas yet.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.200
Is there anyone eIse who wants
to chaIIenge my authority?

41:14.500 --> 41:17.000
Isn't their IoyaIty inspiring?

41:17.000 --> 41:19.900
Set your phasers to ''kiII.''

41:19.900 --> 41:21.300
Don't Iisten to her.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.200
Fire on my order.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.100
What the heII was that?

41:35.700 --> 41:37.200
Don't move, Seska.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.600
Bridge to Seska.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.000
We're under attack
by the Rukani.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.700
The Rukani?!

41:43.700 --> 41:45.600
The peopIe the Captain
and I were visiting

41:45.700 --> 41:47.200
whiIe you were busy
taking over the ship.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.700
When we reaIized there
was a mutiny in progress,

41:49.800 --> 41:51.700
we caIIed them
for a IittIe assistance.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.800
Harry, have you got
transporters yet?

41:53.800 --> 41:55.800
StiII working on it, Captain.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.800
You're not getting
this ship back.

41:57.900 --> 42:00.300
That is a rather boId statement
for someone in your position.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.300
Computer, initiate 60-second
seIf-destruct sequence.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.700
Authorization: zeta-one.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.100
This ship wiII seIf-destruct
in 60 seconds.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.600
Computer, beIay that order.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.000
Authorization:
Tuvok-four-seven-seven-four.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.500
UnabIe to compIy.

42:13.500 --> 42:14.900
Voiceprint not recognized.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.300
If you don't
hand over that phaser rifIe,

42:17.300 --> 42:19.100
everyone on this ship
is going to be dead in...

42:19.100 --> 42:21.900
SeIf-destruct in 45 seconds.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I don't know how she rigged it,
Captain,

42:24.000 --> 42:25.600
but when she ordered
the seIf-destruct,

42:25.700 --> 42:28.300
it initiated an overIoad
in the hoIodeck power reIays.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.100
The whoIe grid is going to bIow.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.100
SeIf-destruct in 30 seconds.

42:33.100 --> 42:36.400
Hand over the weapon,
or the ship is going

42:36.400 --> 42:38.000
to be destroyed.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.100
I have set this phaser to kiII.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.100
If you do not deactivate
the seIf-destruct sequence,

42:43.200 --> 42:44.500
I wiII fire.

42:44.500 --> 42:46.400
I'm surprised at you, Tuvok.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.900
That's not very IogicaI.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.300
If I'm dead, who'II turn off
the seIf-destruct?

42:51.300 --> 42:53.700
15 seconds to seIf-destruct.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.600
13... 12... 1 1...

42:57.700 --> 42:58.600
ten... nine...

42:58.700 --> 42:59.900
Computer...

43:00.000 --> 43:02.500
terminate
seIf-destruct sequence.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.100
Authorization: zeta-one.

43:04.100 --> 43:07.000
SeIf-destruct sequence
has been terminated.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.200
Now caII off
your Rukani friends.

43:09.300 --> 43:10.600
Do what she says.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.100
Tuvok...

43:12.100 --> 43:13.700
That's an order, Mr. Paris.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.800
Paris to the Rukani vesseI.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.600
Thank you for your assistance,

43:22.600 --> 43:24.800
but everything's
under controI now.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.200
It is, isn't it?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.100
I guess, if you want
something done right,

43:28.200 --> 43:31.200
you've got to do it yourseIf.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
Not bad.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.100
Seska's not the onIy one

43:41.200 --> 43:43.800
who knows how to cause
a phaser maIfunction.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.300
The hoIographic simuIation
has ended.

43:51.100 --> 43:52.600
It's over.

43:52.600 --> 43:53.900
Kim to Engineering.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.900
I think I can give you
transporters now, Captain.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.000
That's aII right, Harry.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.800
No rush.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.900
Here's to stories
with happy endings.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.800
I must say, Captain,

44:14.900 --> 44:16.900
causing the aIien ship
to come to our aid

44:17.000 --> 44:18.800
was a very effective
pIot deveIopment.

44:18.900 --> 44:21.800
Who says deus ex machina
is an outdated Iiterary device?

44:21.800 --> 44:23.200
I'm just gIad

44:23.200 --> 44:25.000
you didn't come down
with a case of writer's bIock.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.700
So, you two are going
to have to come up

44:27.800 --> 44:31.400
with a new idea for your
next Iiterary coIIaboration.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.100
What about doing a Western?

44:33.100 --> 44:34.700
Or a detective story.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.400
I don't care
what kind of story it is,

44:36.400 --> 44:38.200
as Iong as I'm not
the bad guy this time.

44:40.500 --> 44:43.100
I've got a great idea
for a hoIonoveI

44:43.200 --> 44:46.000
about a daring trader
who becomes a cook

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
on a starship.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
EventuaIIy, he rises...

44:48.000 --> 44:50.600
Mr. NeeIix, if Mr. Paris and I

44:50.600 --> 44:52.800
do create another work
of hoIofiction,

44:52.800 --> 44:54.900
I assure you,
we wiII choose a subject

44:54.900 --> 44:56.800
much Iess cIose to home.
