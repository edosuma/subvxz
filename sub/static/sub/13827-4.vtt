-This is nuts! Oh, good idea!
-Squirrels love nuts!

00:42.334 --> 00:44.878
Excuse me, ma'am.
But would you happen to have any peanuts,

00:44.962 --> 00:48.257
that my companion and I might use to
entice your frightened little one home,

00:48.340 --> 00:52.386
and back into the warm embrace of his
lovin' family?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.389
Oh, there he goes!

01:05.148 --> 01:06.233
I'll save you!

01:06.316 --> 01:09.236
Wander, no!
I don't like the looks of that cave!

01:09.361 --> 01:10.487
I know,

01:10.571 --> 01:16.577
but if something horrible happens to
that little guy, I'd never forgive myself.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.497
But what if something horrible
happens to you, Wander?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.916
No, no, no!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.418
Sorry. I love you.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.630
(SIGHS) I love you too, buddy,

01:28.755 --> 01:31.258
but why is there this part of you
that always has to do

01:31.341 --> 01:33.510
the wrong things for the right reasons?

01:35.429 --> 01:39.349
WANDER: (SCREAMING) Watch Out!
This is amazing!

01:39.808 --> 01:44.521
Oh, thank grop he's okay.
I'm gonna to throttle him.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.704
Whoa! It's beautiful!

02:01.872 --> 02:04.499
Well, I'll be! It's multiple me's!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.084
Howdy-do to you!

02:06.168 --> 02:07.211
I mean me!

02:11.965 --> 02:15.928
-That is awesome!
-I know, right?

02:24.520 --> 02:27.439
What have I asked you
about running off like that?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.192
SYLVIA: Promise you will never do that.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.113
Hey, what did I just say?

02:48.585 --> 02:52.673
Never hurts to help! Let's go! Yeah!
This is great!

02:52.756 --> 02:54.967
What is going on?

02:56.009 --> 02:59.137
Hey, keep it down out here. I'm
trying to sleep

03:04.101 --> 03:05.686
Wander!

03:07.938 --> 03:11.024
Wander? Wander!

03:19.992 --> 03:21.702
What is going on?

03:21.827 --> 03:25.414
The indigenous crystals have fractured the
varying facets of my persona

03:25.497 --> 03:28.959
and liberated them, sending them traipsing
over the countryside hither and yon.

03:29.042 --> 03:33.297
Time is of the essence. If the personality
fragments are not reunited expeditiously,

03:33.380 --> 03:35.674
WANDER: the original specimen
will disappear.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.855
Okay, wait so he's him,
and he is him, and you're him,

03:49.938 --> 03:51.356
then that means that they're also him.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.358
but if I don't get him and you and him
back into him

03:53.442 --> 03:54.985
then he won't be him anymore!

03:55.068 --> 03:57.821
In an inarticulate, garbled manner
of speaking...

03:59.031 --> 04:00.115
Yes.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.243
Thanks. That's all I needed.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.287
Not so smart now, are you?

04:09.082 --> 04:15.088
No! Is this the end of
Overly-Dramatic Wander?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.509
And scene.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.845
Yes! You're gonna be okay, pal.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.348
Just gotta get the rest of you's back
into you.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.725
Hey, pal! Come here!

04:27.518 --> 04:30.521
No, no. No!

04:33.315 --> 04:34.608
Oh, I get it.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.153
You're the one that always runs off and
does stuff, even though I tell you not to!

04:38.237 --> 04:39.321
Well, fine.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.990
Go. It's your fault. We're in this mess
in the first place.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.202
Wander's better off without you! (SNORTS)

04:50.624 --> 04:52.292

Yeah, maybe you're right.

That's ama... (MUSIC)

06:18.962 --> 06:23.050

using their traits as bait.

-Five down, 415 to go!

and talk about lady things

no bad guys are nearby!

sure looks sad.

07:40.252 --> 07:45.048

07:45.841 --> 07:47.676
Come on, buddy. Please.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.096
What's wrong? I put them all back in.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.347
Whom did I forget?

07:56.018 --> 07:57.603
No, no, not him.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.648
He's the one that always gets us into
trouble, and he won't listen to me, anyway

08:01.732 --> 08:04.943
if you don't accept all of us,
you accept none of us.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.530
Whoah, that's deep, dude.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.534
He's just gonna causing trouble!
And I don't wanna

08:19.291 --> 08:23.212
Flabdrassin' Wanders. Make me do the wrong
things for the right reasons.

08:26.131 --> 08:30.302
This one always does whatever
I tell him not to.

08:51.114 --> 08:55.827
Gotcha! (STRUGGLING)
Are we sure about this?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.747
Because my life is pretty crazy
with this one in it.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.378
But it'll be so much worse without you.

09:11.301 --> 09:15.764
YEE-HAW!

09:17.224 --> 09:19.726
Wander? Are you okay?

09:19.852 --> 09:21.144
I'm more than okay.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.438
I'm perfect now come trusty Steed,

09:23.522 --> 09:25.691
it's time to stop that heartless evildoer.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.442
Lord Hater once and for all!

09:28.902 --> 09:30.737
Wait, what? Stop?

09:30.821 --> 09:33.991
Yes! I am a good guy and he is a bad guy
and I stop him!

09:35.826 --> 09:40.289
No, no, no, no. The Wander I know wants to
befriend Hater, not stop him.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.542
SYLVIA: Wait! Why are all these other
Wanders still up there?

09:43.667 --> 09:45.210
Something's not right.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.426
Wander, that Crystal has no reflection.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.428
We're still missing some part of you.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.597
That's okay. I'm a lot better without it.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.433
-Let's go go go!
-No. I've learned my lesson.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.518
Every part of you is important.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.410
The helper seeks to help

10:18.577 --> 10:21.246
because he knows what
it is to be helpless.

10:21.747 --> 10:27.544
Hey, little guy, it's okay.
I won't hurt you. Come on.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.525
Thanks, Syl. That was the most
important part.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.452
I wouldn't want someone else
to go through what I went through.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.120
Love that part of you, buddy.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.546
LORD HATER: Over? What do you mean
it's over?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.089
But I conquered you!

11:12.214 --> 11:14.258
Your planet belongs to me.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.759
Belonged to you.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.928
Look, you really haven't
been around a lot lately,

11:18.011 --> 11:21.098
so we weren't even sure if you were
still in the ruling us anymore.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.809
so we, like, well, we met someone else.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.853
Someone else? Who?

11:26.103 --> 11:31.024
Is it Emperor Awesome? The Black Cube
of Darkness? Dominator?

11:31.149 --> 11:34.945
-It's, uh. It's the,
-Evil Sandwich!

11:35.445 --> 11:39.908
That's right. This is I Sourdough
the evil sandwich,

11:40.033 --> 11:44.746
and I have seized control of yet another
one of your planet's Lord Hater.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.831
Oh, yeah?

11:45.914 --> 11:48.667
Well, I didn't even want
that stupid planet anyway.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.879
I got plenty of other
planets that away better.

11:51.962 --> 11:56.008
No, you don't! Have you checked
the villain leaderboard lately?

11:56.425 --> 12:02.764
Uh yeah! I don't know the exact number,
but I'm like way up there.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.226
-Right, Peepers?
-Oh, the sandwich is right, sir.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.396
PEEPERS: That was the last planet
we had control of in this system,

12:09.479 --> 12:11.899
which knocks us completely
of a villain board.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.278
You're more of a "near-do-well"
than a villain.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.322
How bad are you with this?

12:25.037 --> 12:27.331
Wow, You can't even do that right?

12:30.292 --> 12:32.127
How did that work out for you?

12:32.336 --> 12:36.381
Sir, this is exactly what I warned
you about my report,

12:36.465 --> 12:39.051
entitled "Oblique Strategies for
Successful Masters of Evil."

12:39.176 --> 12:41.970
I clearly stated that the only way
to truly rule the galaxy...

12:42.054 --> 12:44.723
is through careful planning,
precise focus, and hard work.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.976
-But, no! You!
-Me?

12:48.060 --> 12:50.687
Don't tell me what being
evil is all about!

12:51.063 --> 12:55.526
It's about being all (LIGHTING FLASHES)
scary, bad guy stuff!

12:55.609 --> 13:00.155
Not uh, blah, blah,
meeting stiff, business guy stuff.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.534
Wow. I can't believe I never figured this
out before.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.371
The reason we've been failing
all this time, is because...

13:07.454 --> 13:09.373
you waste all our resources is
trying to destroy

13:09.456 --> 13:12.459
a happy go lucky do gooder who just wants
to be your friend.

13:13.794 --> 13:18.882
Because you and your boring plans
have been keeping me down.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.968
Civilian Peepers!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.637
Uh, sir, with due respect, it's Commander.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.390
Not anymore. You're fired

13:40.487 --> 13:42.823
Oh, this isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

13:43.407 --> 13:44.783
This isn't happening.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.911
He'll realize he made a mistake.
He needs me.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.247
-Peepers, I need you.
-Of course, sir

13:50.330 --> 13:52.791
-What can I do for you?
-Before you go,

13:53.041 --> 13:55.502
how do I like find planets to conquer?

13:55.669 --> 13:57.796
Are they just sort of around, or...

13:58.630 --> 14:01.633
Check the intergalactic matrix
in the command console.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.679
-The red button on the black thing.
-Thanks

14:05.804 --> 14:08.807
Man I'm so stoked to be running things
without you getting in my way all the time

14:08.891 --> 14:11.560
Anyway, you're still fired! Adios.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.147
Peepers, wait.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.691
-Yes?
-You know those eyeball guys I have,

14:18.108 --> 14:20.402
how often do I need
to change their batteries?

14:20.527 --> 14:23.197
They're not Robots? They're watchdogs.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.532
Oh, they're dogs. Huh?

14:25.657 --> 14:28.619
-So I gotta walk them then?
-They're not dogs either they're...

14:28.744 --> 14:32.206
Gotcha. Robot dogs feed them batteries.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.250
Thanks, buddy. I owe you. Not enough
to save your job though

14:37.044 --> 14:38.587
-Peepers wait.
-What?

14:38.670 --> 14:42.966
Look, I realize now I may have
been a bit hasty before.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.051
-You do?
-Yeah.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.678
I almost forgot to ask you what's your
log in password?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.722
I need to erase you from the system.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.184
Hater and Peepers forever

14:52.267 --> 14:55.729
That's H-8-R-N-P33P3RS,
with 3 for the e's, 4-E-V-R.

14:57.731 --> 15:02.444
Delete that. Delete that. Delete that.
Delete that. Delete that. Delete that.

15:02.528 --> 15:06.865
Delete... actually no, these memories.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.160
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

15:11.328 --> 15:12.955
Yes, sir. We sure have.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.457
I'm having second thoughts

15:15.582 --> 15:18.293
Instead of deleting these, could you just
crop yourself out?

15:18.377 --> 15:21.296
-Cool. Well, goodbye forever!
-He'll see.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.924

without me!

♪But a sandwich took our planets
and I got canned♪

16:54.848 --> 17:00.604
♪The commander who's made
his last command♪

17:03.815 --> 17:05.192
Where to? My friend.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.735
Just drive.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.789
-Who wants batteries?
-Hater!

17:19.039 --> 17:21.542
Well, well, well, Sourdough.

17:21.625 --> 17:26.255
I must admit it was a pleasure to beat you
Oh! I should've said eat you. Do over.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.424
Wow, you're even bad at sandwich puns.

17:29.508 --> 17:34.972
-Sad, why are you messing with my planets?
-Oh, do you mean my planets?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.182
The planets that used to be yours but
are now totally mine

17:37.349 --> 17:40.978
'cuz I conquered 'em because I'm awesome
and you're a dumb sandwich. Those planets?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.438
You conquered!
Deal with it, pimento brain!

17:43.564 --> 17:45.899
What? You didn't conquer squat.

17:45.983 --> 17:50.737
You just knocked off crowns,
planted flags or did stupid dances.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.198
Uh, yeah. I conquered them.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.783
No, that's wrong.

17:54.992 --> 17:58.620
You've got to leave a battalion behind.
Establish infrastructure.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.248
Don't you know anything about
being an evil ruler?

18:01.456 --> 18:04.251
-Uhhh
-Where's the angry little smart guy?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.503
The one who actually knows
what evil is all about?

18:06.587 --> 18:10.674
I know what evil is all about!
Prepare to become a patty melt!

18:19.892 --> 18:21.351
Uh, finger slipped?

18:24.396 --> 18:27.733
Fire! Which one's the shieldy thing?

18:32.821 --> 18:36.116
How are you so bad at this?

18:36.200 --> 18:40.454
I conquered this entire quadrant
and I'm a sandwich.

18:40.579 --> 18:43.957
-You're a powerful electrical skeleton man
-Shut your buns!

18:48.921 --> 18:54.801
-Saline tester, I could do that.
-Hey, Peepers. 'Sup? -Sir?

18:56.762 --> 18:59.431
Just one last question.
Not that I need your help

18:59.640 --> 19:03.352
but if someone got in a major
dogfight with a sandwich,

19:03.435 --> 19:06.271
what would one do?

19:09.942 --> 19:11.610
I thought I was in your way.

19:11.735 --> 19:12.945
Oh, you were a big time.

19:13.028 --> 19:17.366
And I can handle this, but I'm just
going around getting second opinions.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.911
I don't know. Is there maybe something
you want to tell me first?

19:20.994 --> 19:24.623
-Maybe you wanna say you're...
-Sorry, nope. Uh, can't think of anything.

19:25.290 --> 19:29.044
Hurry, Lord Hater, apologize!

19:29.127 --> 19:32.214
-I don't wanna!
-I'm waiting.

19:32.381 --> 19:35.300
You want advice? In old galaxy,
I work as villain.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.928
Shut your face! Peepers, come on.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.680
What did I ever do to you?

19:46.103 --> 19:50.065
I'm sorry. You felt I did something wrong.

19:52.943 --> 19:57.239
I'm sorry... that you're such a
whiny over-sensitive baby!

19:57.322 --> 19:59.616
No, no, no, no, wait, please.
I can get this.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.078
It was my bad. And I'm so...

20:07.833 --> 20:11.128
I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with this.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.504
Close enough.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.344
Watchdogs! We're pulling a reverse
Galaxon Phalanx

20:19.469 --> 20:23.307
maneuver into an aggressive
Cropdust Wedge! Eye fighters, deploy!

20:28.520 --> 20:30.272
Shields, activate!

20:32.274 --> 20:35.068
And with Sandwich's whole armada
focused on us.

20:35.235 --> 20:41.575
He's left his planets totally
vulnerable! (LAUGHS)

20:48.874 --> 20:50.959
Ooh, ooh. I wanna help. What can I do?

20:51.043 --> 20:52.836
What you do best, sir?

20:58.842 --> 21:02.513
Evil Sandwich! You're toast!

21:13.440 --> 21:19.404
-Now for the finishing touch.
-Evil Sandwich.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.877
(WOMAN) Hey, hater.
So glad we're back together.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.964
It was so embarrassing
being ruled by a sandwich.

21:37.047 --> 21:40.175
Well, I couldn't have done it without me.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.635
If I hadn't fired Peepers this

21:41.718 --> 21:43.554
-never would have happened.
-No.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.353
(GASPS) Sir...

21:54.314 --> 21:55.858
Don't make me fire you again.

21:58.485 --> 22:03.073
Commander Peepers! (MUSIC PLAYING)

22:03.657 --> 22:05.868
Bleep bloop. Rules and planning. Strategy.

22:05.951 --> 22:10.706
No emotion. Does not compute.
Servo shutting down. Nee

22:14.376 --> 22:16.712
System's operating at peak efficiency.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.672
I am a giant nerd.
