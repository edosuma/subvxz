Previously onMike & Molly:Molly is a writer now.

00:05.048 --> 00:05.962
PEGGY [chuckling]:
Oh.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.051
Why didn't you say so?

00:08.138 --> 00:11.663
Let me clear a spot
in my bookcase.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.491
MOLLY:
You know,
it just so happens

00:13.578 --> 00:14.971
that there are a lot
of regular women, just like me,

00:15.058 --> 00:16.973
who have written
best-selling books.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.801
[blows raspberry]

00:18.888 --> 00:21.064
That's it,
we're doing this.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.283
Make your move, come on.

00:22.370 --> 00:23.719
I'll give you
one swing...

00:23.806 --> 00:25.938
No, no, come on,
nobody's fighting!

00:27.723 --> 00:28.550
MIKE:
Hey.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.247
What you writing?

00:30.334 --> 00:32.075
Oh, just experimenting
with a short story.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.382
Really? I like
short stories 'cause,

00:34.469 --> 00:36.036
you know, they're short.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.691
Can I take a look?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.084
Oh, no, no, no.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.085
It's not ready
for public consumption.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.261
Oh, come on.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.177
I showed you that poem I wrote
about the Chicago Bears.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.918
Yeah, I remember, uh...

00:49.005 --> 00:51.703
"The Hall of Fame will admitcha,

00:51.790 --> 00:52.965
if you listen to Coach Ditka."

00:55.838 --> 00:58.101
I wonder if he ever got it.

00:58.188 --> 01:01.322
So, can you at least tell
me what the story's about?

01:01.409 --> 01:02.671
Uh, let's see.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.413
It's about a man
and a woman and...

01:05.500 --> 01:08.198
the day-to-day stuff
they go through.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.286
That's it?Mm-hmm.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.289
Well, is it at least sexy?

01:12.376 --> 01:15.162
Sexy? No. Pfft!

01:15.249 --> 01:18.774
Okay. Well, when you're ready,
I would love to read it.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.167
You got it.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.516
Okay. Love you.Love you, too.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.604
By the way,

01:22.691 --> 01:24.258
I know it's sexy.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.869
Pfft! What are
you talking about?

01:26.956 --> 01:28.523
Because in all the time
I have known you,

01:28.610 --> 01:29.959
you have never once gone "pfft!"

01:30.046 --> 01:33.615
What? Pfft! I just did it.

01:33.702 --> 01:36.835
I do it all the time.

01:36.922 --> 01:40.187
Ridiculous. Pfft!

01:40.274 --> 01:42.232
[phone rings]

01:42.319 --> 01:44.234
[sighs]

01:44.321 --> 01:45.801
Oh.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.933
Hey, Victoria.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.719
Yeah, we're still on
for happy hour.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.634
I don't know, a vodka tonic?

01:52.721 --> 01:53.852
It's 8:00 in the morning.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.464
Do I really have to decide now?

01:56.551 --> 01:59.249
Okay, listen,
I'm working. I gotta go.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.121
Bye. Bye.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.993
Bye.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.170
Okay. Let's get this
party started.

No more embarrassing bald spot.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.018
Victoria.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.456
Yeah, I'm not done
yet. Come on in.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.893
Not a chance.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.677
There's nothing to be afraid of.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.592
Beg to differ.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.378
Oh, don't be a baby.
Get in here.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.640
[sighs] Fine.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.952
I'm in.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.389
Why are you looking
up at the ceiling?

05:02.476 --> 05:04.565
Because there are
no dead people up there.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.828
Well, you're gonna be
looking up there for a while

05:06.915 --> 05:08.612
'cause I need
like another hour.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.614
Are you kidding?
Oh, God!

05:10.701 --> 05:12.747
Why didn't you call me?

05:12.834 --> 05:14.270
Sorry.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.098
I got caught up
trying to plug the holes

05:16.185 --> 05:18.666
in that drug dealer's head.

05:18.753 --> 05:19.623
I might just put a hat on him.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.669
Maybe a do-rag.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.628
Oh, God.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.151
Covering your eyes?
Really?

05:26.238 --> 05:28.589
Yes, I prefer not to have
the images of death

05:28.676 --> 05:30.591
seared into my brain.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.332
Do you want to see a brain?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.421
No. No!

05:34.508 --> 05:35.900
Are you sure? 'Cause I got one
here right in a jar.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.990
No, no, I'll wait for you
in the car. Oh!

05:40.818 --> 05:42.951
I'm sorry.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.779
I'm so sorry.

05:44.866 --> 05:45.780
Sorry.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.738
Oh!

MIKE:
Hello?

05:52.830 --> 05:55.920
Anybody home?

05:56.007 --> 05:58.009
Molly?

05:59.663 --> 06:00.925
Oh. "Mike,

06:01.012 --> 06:02.318
"having a drink
with Victoria.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.016
See you later. M."

06:05.103 --> 06:06.714
Well, I guess it's just me.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.637
It is just me, right?!

06:22.599 --> 06:23.687
Oh, this is wrong.
This is so wrong.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.753
[imitating Tweety]:
I am a bad puddy tat.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.499
Huh.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.805
Okay, password protected. Smart.

06:54.892 --> 06:58.026
"Mike and Molly."

06:58.113 --> 07:00.855
And I'm in.

07:00.942 --> 07:04.336
"The Story of M."

07:04.424 --> 07:07.688
"The warmth of his excitement
awoke something inside her.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.212
Something animal."

07:10.299 --> 07:13.694
"Pfft," my ass.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.739
"She reached back
with her eager hand

07:15.826 --> 07:17.915
and greedily sought
his turgid girth."

07:21.789 --> 07:24.661
Girth, I know.
Turgid, I'm not so sure about.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.718
No, that's enough,
that's enough.

07:37.805 --> 07:41.461
Oh, who am I kidding?

07:45.421 --> 07:47.684
I could really
use that drink about now.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.903
Almost done.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.383
You said that three bodies ago.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.255
Come on in.
You can keep me company.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.386
I can't. Sorry.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.040
Sure you can.

07:56.127 --> 07:59.479
You just got to do this
one step at a time.

07:59.566 --> 08:03.134
[groans]Here. Look at
Mrs. Kilgallon.

08:03.221 --> 08:06.398
I... don't want to.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.488
Just look at her.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.578
She was a nice
old lady who died
peacefully in her sleep.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.449
So, no bullet holes?

08:13.536 --> 08:16.626
Well, just a tramp stamp,
believe it or not.

08:22.240 --> 08:22.980
All right, I'll look.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.201
Ooh-hoo, ooh.

08:26.288 --> 08:29.247
Look, I'm looking.
[giggles]

08:29.334 --> 08:30.945
See? Nothing
to be scared of.

08:31.032 --> 08:34.035
Nope. You're right.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.080
[continues nervous giggling]

08:38.213 --> 08:40.084
Do you want
to touch her?

08:40.171 --> 08:43.218
No, I couldn't, no.
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.480
She doesn't mind.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.352
I mind, I mind.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.658
Why are you
giggling?

08:48.745 --> 08:51.748
I don't know.
But I can't stop.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.447
Just give her
a little poke.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.451
Poke? No, no poking,
can't poke.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.410
This will be great
for your writing.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.368
You're always saying that you
want to experience new things

09:03.455 --> 09:05.675
so that you can
describe them.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.460
Ugh, I did say that,
didn't I?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.679
Okay.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.899
Ooh. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.905
[giggles]

09:17.992 --> 09:20.037
Ooh! Ooh!

09:20.124 --> 09:21.952
I did it. I touched her.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.476
I touched a dead lady. Ooh.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.478
See? It's no big deal.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.872
Actually, she's a lot colder
than I thought she'd be.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.178
It's like...

09:30.265 --> 09:33.398
it's like, uh,
touching bologna.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.663
That reminds me, I got
some cold cuts in the
fridge. You hungry?

09:36.750 --> 09:37.968
Ooh. Oh, God,
she opened her eyes.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.580
Look-it,
she opened her eyes!

09:40.667 --> 09:41.537
Calm down.

09:41.624 --> 09:42.973
Sometimes this happens.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.367
Oh. Aah!

09:45.454 --> 09:47.674
Bologna. Aah!

09:50.154 --> 09:52.853
"He was helpless,

09:52.940 --> 09:56.378
"his hands bound behind his back

greedily enveloped his sw..."

10:00.512 --> 10:02.645
Yo, big guy.Oh, nothing!

10:04.691 --> 10:05.605
What you doing?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.258
Just grabbing a bite.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.739
[chuckles]
Molly's not home, nobody's home,

10:09.826 --> 10:12.481
I didn't do anything.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.266
That Molly's laptop?

10:19.444 --> 10:21.098
Yeah, I be...
I believe that is.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.930
She's pretty private
about what's on there.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.106
You're not
reading it, are you?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.413
No. Pfft.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.550
All right.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.073
See you in
the morning.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.078
Night.Night.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.691
Mike.Nothing!

10:54.175 --> 10:55.916
[quietly]:
Oh, boy.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.614
Oh, boy.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.486
Oh, God.

11:01.573 --> 11:02.923
You okay?

11:03.010 --> 11:06.056
Well, I'd kill
for some Purell.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.015
Sorry Mrs. Kilgallon
gave you the hairy eyeball.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.931
I don't know how you
can do this for a living.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.541
Oh, it's like anything.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.499
You get used to it.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.807
Yeah, but doesn't it
make you a little sad?

11:17.894 --> 11:20.201
Sometimes, sure.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.291
But over the years,
you find little ways to cope.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.424
Like what?
Like marijuana.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.687
Want some?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.079
No, that's
not my thing.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.515
You sure?

11:30.602 --> 11:32.039
Just a little toke
to take the edge off.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.041
No.
We were gonna
go drinking.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.607
This is just
a different approach

11:35.695 --> 11:37.348
to solving
the same problem.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.915
What problem?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.134
Life, baby.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.703
Okay, fine.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.140
Fire it up.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.011
All right,
I should tell you,

11:48.098 --> 11:50.927
the last time I smoked pot
was in college and it didn't

11:51.014 --> 11:52.799
have much effect on me.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.017
Who's a dead person?

11:54.104 --> 11:55.497
You'rea dead person.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.064
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.644
"He grabbed a fistful
of her chestnut hair

12:12.732 --> 12:14.298
"and dragged her
to the bay window

12:14.385 --> 12:16.866
"where the entire town

12:16.953 --> 12:19.042
"could see her surrender.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
"She had no choice.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.352
She was a slave
to his tumescent length."

12:28.660 --> 12:30.967
Yikes.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.926
Who'd have thought
your meek little wife

12:33.013 --> 12:36.538
knew 50 different words
for boner?

12:37.582 --> 12:38.845
She went to college.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.672
You know, your
vocabulary expands.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.327
"Expands." That's funny.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.896
It's wild.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.377
Her-her diary's
nowhere near this dirty.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.031
You read her diary?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.423
You hacked her computer.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.512
We all have
blood on our hands.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.906
All right, all right.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.995
The question is,
what do I do now?

12:59.082 --> 13:00.649
I know what I'd do.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.607
I'd study this thing
like it was the Talmud.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.785
What?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.874
Your wife just handed you
an erogenous road map

13:07.961 --> 13:11.399
to her protected wetlands.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.052
Use it.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.881
No.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.492
I'm not really
the "kinky, tie 'em up,

13:17.579 --> 13:20.408
put things where they
don't belong" kind of guy.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.410
Well, this
isn't about you.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.412
It's about Molly wanting
to try new things.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.240
I mean, how would you
like it if someone

13:26.327 --> 13:28.851
served you the same stack
of pancakes every morning?

13:28.938 --> 13:29.896
Are you kidding?

13:29.983 --> 13:31.811
That's hisfantasy.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.728
You just made
his stomach turgid.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.385
What I'm saying is,

13:41.472 --> 13:43.866
you might have
to step outside
your comfort zone

13:43.953 --> 13:44.736
to please your wife.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.957
Aw.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.699
That's why Joyce and I
are so compatible.

13:50.786 --> 13:54.485
I will wear, eat
or do anything.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.837
Anything.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.577
Aah!

14:02.276 --> 14:03.886
You got to go easy
on the blush.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.020
Relatives hate it
when grandma looks like a whore.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.850
You know, the last time

14:10.937 --> 14:13.417
I was at a funeral was Dad's.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.463
That was a while back.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.031
Yeah, I was... eight.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.163
I kept, I kept hoping
that he was gonna

14:20.250 --> 14:22.862
sit up and yell, "Surprise."

14:24.211 --> 14:25.865
And he didn't.

14:27.910 --> 14:32.523
No, he... he didn't.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.788
I don't remember any of that.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.879
Well, sweetie, you were three.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.229
You remember him at all?

14:42.316 --> 14:44.666
Not really.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.887
Just the smell of beer
and Hai Karate and smoke.

14:47.974 --> 14:52.282
But that could've been Mom.

14:52.369 --> 14:55.329
You would have liked him.

14:55.416 --> 14:59.028
He was really funny and...
and sweet-tempered.

14:59.115 --> 15:02.510
He was like a... he was
like a giant teddy bear.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.034
Sounds like Mike.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.517
Huh.

15:10.605 --> 15:14.435
How about that.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.960
Well, the good news is
I'm clearly not freaked-out

15:18.047 --> 15:21.572
by any of this
dead business anymore.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.922
Good.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
Then I think you're
ready for this.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.059
You ever seen balls
this big in your life?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.244
I'm gonna need more pot.

15:47.511 --> 15:51.080
[whistle]Mmm. Aw.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.256
Gentlemen.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.519
Hey, I thought you were
staying in tonight.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.347
Yeah, well, Molly's out
with her sister

15:57.434 --> 15:59.088
so I thought maybe
I'd join you boys.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.089
Can I get a round
for my friends?

16:05.573 --> 16:06.748
What?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.837
Everything okay?

16:08.924 --> 16:11.492
Yeah, it's all good. Why?

16:11.579 --> 16:13.059
Y-You called us friends,
and you're buying.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.975
Very funny.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.761
I see the Eagles are running
that new offense, huh?Mm-hmm.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.720
I don't know why
you would go and change
something that's working.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.157
Well, there is wisdom

16:24.244 --> 16:25.897
in mixing things
up so the defense

16:25.985 --> 16:28.074
can't predict your every move.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.553
That's crap.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.380
Straight-ahead,
smash-mouth football.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.295
May not be pretty,

16:32.382 --> 16:34.689
but it gets the job done
every time.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.430
No, I agree
with Samuel.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.040
Changing the playbook puts
excitement back into the game.

16:38.127 --> 16:41.261
There's plenty
of excitement in the game.

16:42.218 --> 16:46.309
It's all about
fundamentals, damn it.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.484
Whoa.

16:47.571 --> 16:48.007
Okay.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.623
So, problems
in the bedroom?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.407
Buy your own
stupid drinks.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.808
[Molly and Victoria giggle]

17:06.895 --> 17:07.417
Ooh.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.767
Caskets.

17:12.683 --> 17:13.858
That one there?

17:13.945 --> 17:14.990
Like $50,000.[gasps]

17:15.077 --> 17:17.906
That's more than my car.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.603
Worth it.

17:19.690 --> 17:20.648
Hop in.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.345
Give it a test drive.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.694
No way.

17:23.781 --> 17:24.434
Come on, I do it
all the time.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.611
What? No.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.440
It's a perfect place
to take a nap.

17:30.527 --> 17:31.572
'Cause you're crazy.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.879
[giggles]

17:34.966 --> 17:38.840
Good evening, Ms. Flynn.
Won't you join me?

17:38.927 --> 17:40.494
I want to try that.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.324
Oh,

17:44.411 --> 17:47.240
I'm getting in a coffin.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.852
I'm getting in a coffin.
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.071
I'm in a coffin.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.165
This is extremely comfortable.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.209
Right?

18:00.296 --> 18:01.558
[vacuum cleaner starts]

18:01.645 --> 18:03.604
Get down, get down, get d...

18:10.872 --> 18:12.613
[whispers]:
Stop it.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.528
[vacuum cleaner stops]

18:17.922 --> 18:19.924
[vacuum cleaner resumes]

18:23.014 --> 18:23.580
Ouch.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.408
[giggling]

18:25.495 --> 18:28.194
[vacuum cleaner stops]

18:28.281 --> 18:29.543
Do you want a Bugle?

18:29.630 --> 18:30.196
[screams]

18:43.034 --> 18:45.907
I'm sorry, but
funeral parlors rock.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.345
I just feel bad
for the cleaning lady.Well,

18:49.432 --> 18:52.914
how were we supposed to know
she'd just lost her mother?

18:53.001 --> 18:53.871
Good night.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.873
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.223
I'm married to a cop.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.355
Do I smell like
mara-hoochie?

19:00.530 --> 19:01.836
[sniffs]

19:01.923 --> 19:04.143
No. Just cadavers
and Corn Nuts.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.361
Great.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.406
Good night.Good night.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.539
Good night, Vince.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.454
[giggles]

19:11.541 --> 19:14.805
What?

19:14.892 --> 19:16.285
Good night, Mom.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
[giggles]

19:21.812 --> 19:24.641
Ooh, the pot.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.730
[snores]

19:33.868 --> 19:35.478
Mike?

19:35.565 --> 19:37.524
Oh, hey, Mol.

19:38.786 --> 19:39.352
What you doing?

19:41.354 --> 19:44.879
If you have to ask, I failed.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.837
[sighs]

19:46.924 --> 19:49.927
Do I have to change
the password on my laptop?

19:50.014 --> 19:51.494
Probably a good idea.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.368
Can you take these cuffs off?

19:55.455 --> 19:59.154
Yeah. When I'm done with you.
