Lena: Drill, I want you
to leave my daughter alone.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.137
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.838
Drill said he wants something from you.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.407
Maybe you can make a deal.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.143
I lived with this thing in
my head for three months.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.645
- What <i> does</i> it want?
- To destroy us, sir.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.581
- [Electricity crackles]
- It's Drill. He's here.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.918
Wes, we can end this,
get rid of Drill for good.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.454
[Explosion]

00:22.489 --> 00:24.289
Take my car. You run. Go.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.957
Claire Bennigan was responsible.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.927
Bennigan's son... I
want him in our custody.

00:36.503 --> 00:40.739
Are you sure my mom's gonna be there?

00:40.774 --> 00:45.410
Don't worry, Henry. It
should be just up ahead.

I'm right here, sweetheart.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.386
Look, I can explain. [Grunts]

01:28.422 --> 01:30.255
Ohh.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.225
[Coughs, groans]

01:33.260 --> 01:35.527
What the hell were you thinking?

01:35.562 --> 01:38.530
- I was thinking about my country, sir.
- No, no, no, don't play the patriot, son.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.932
- You aided and abetted someone who's...
- What Sean and Claire did...

01:40.968 --> 01:42.567
was treason, Wes.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.768
And when we find 'em,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.370
they will be punished accordingly.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.673
No, you won't, sir.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.908
You ordered an FBI agent
to kidnap their son.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.376
Now is that how we're
doing things these days?

01:51.411 --> 01:52.978
Because I'm sure the American people

01:53.013 --> 01:54.312
will be interested to know

01:54.348 --> 01:55.814
that that's how you're running things.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.350
- Easy. You're out of your depth here.
- And why stop there?

01:58.385 --> 02:00.018
Maybe it's time to go
public with everything...

02:00.053 --> 02:01.219
the meltdown, the rock,

02:01.255 --> 02:03.288
the alien manipulating our children.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.157
Everything that we have kept secret

02:05.192 --> 02:06.424
in the name of national security

02:06.460 --> 02:09.094
while every day we're becoming less secure.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.829
You're not that guy, Wes.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.664
No.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.533
I can be if I have to.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.871
Sir, I know this didn't go
down the way you planned it,

02:19.907 --> 02:21.406
but look at the results.

02:21.441 --> 02:24.809
We have illuminated a very
real, very imminent threat.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.812
How do you confirm the death
of something you cannot see?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.081
Drill is an electrical entity.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.350
We set off an E.M.P.
while he was in the room.

02:32.386 --> 02:36.254
My team has not even found
one shred of electrical energy.

02:36.290 --> 02:40.192
Now if I may be so bold, sir,
depending on how you play this,

02:40.227 --> 02:43.295
I just handed you the presidency.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.569
Make sure this place is cleaned up.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.104
Do we have an understanding
about Sean and Claire Bennigan?

02:53.140 --> 02:55.106
I'll let you know what I decide.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.542
[Car door closes]

02:57.578 --> 02:59.010
Why'd you do it?

02:59.046 --> 03:00.979
Look, all the secretary
wanted was updates on our case.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.781
If all he wanted was updates on our case,

03:02.816 --> 03:05.050
he wouldn't have asked
you to spy on your partner.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.152
How could you just how could I what?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.454
Follow a direct order?
Obey chain of command?

03:09.489 --> 03:11.790
So why stop now?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.893
There's some things you
don't ask a man to do.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.440
Okay, so what now?

03:28.475 --> 03:30.242
Three of us get in that car,

03:30.277 --> 03:31.843
lay low until Wes can clear the air.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.145
But what about Drill?

03:42.489 --> 03:47.759
Henry, Drill's gone, sweetheart.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.995
No, he's not.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.363
What do you mean?

03:51.398 --> 03:54.499
Right before Mr. Rollins
came to pick me up,

03:54.534 --> 03:55.967
Drill came over.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.837
He wanted to talk.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.839
Talk about what?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.207
About you and Mommy.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.378
He sounded... different.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.413
Different how?

04:08.528 --> 04:11.796
Like he was mad about
something you guys did.

04:12.032 --> 04:16.801
- He wanted to know where you were.
- Okay.

04:16.837 --> 04:18.136
Okay, okay.

04:18.171 --> 04:19.337
[Kisses]

04:19.406 --> 04:21.873
Go wait for us in the...
in the car, okay, baby?

04:21.908 --> 04:24.042
Mommy and Daddy have to talk.

04:29.616 --> 04:30.915
- If he's looking for us...
- Claire...

04:30.951 --> 04:33.118
- we can't risk having Henry...
- I can protect our son.

04:33.153 --> 04:34.953
How? You have seen what Drill can do.

04:34.988 --> 04:38.223
Is he safer with the FBI? With your mom?

04:38.258 --> 04:41.326
Claire, it doesn't matter where Henry is.

04:41.361 --> 04:45.497
If there is electricity,
Drill can find him.

04:45.532 --> 04:48.366
We're better off together.

04:48.402 --> 04:50.802
Come on.

04:53.974 --> 04:55.974
Everything's gonna be okay for now.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.575
What do you mean?

04:57.611 --> 05:00.512
Drill. He's gone.

05:00.547 --> 05:02.213
- We eliminated him.
- Oh, my god.

05:02.249 --> 05:04.282
- [Chuckles]
- Oh, my god.

05:04.317 --> 05:06.117
Oh, when? [Kisses]

05:06.153 --> 05:09.754
I don't know about, uh,
three, three, four hours ago.

05:12.926 --> 05:16.361
Wes, he was here an hour ago.

05:16.396 --> 05:20.498
That's not... that's not possible.

05:20.534 --> 05:21.900
I should've told you this sooner,

05:21.935 --> 05:25.270
but, um, I've been talking to him.

05:25.305 --> 05:27.839
You talk... to Drill?

05:27.874 --> 05:31.276
Well, not directly, but through Minx.

05:31.311 --> 05:33.044
I asked questions,

05:33.079 --> 05:37.382
and she told me what his answers were.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.751
- Lena...
- Look, I know, I know, Wes. I'm so sorry.

05:39.786 --> 05:42.587
- I just...
- You're... you're sure this happened an hour ago?

05:42.622 --> 05:45.690
Minx came in here, and she woke me up,

05:45.725 --> 05:49.027
and she told me he wanted
to play a game with me.

05:49.062 --> 05:50.361
What kind of a game?

05:50.397 --> 05:55.533
She told me he'd show me when he's ready.

05:55.569 --> 05:58.303
[Whispers] Hey, Minx?

05:58.338 --> 06:00.772
- What is it, Daddy?
- It's okay, sweetie.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.775
I... I just need to know
if you were helping Mommy

06:03.810 --> 06:05.343
talk to Drill tonight.

06:05.378 --> 06:09.314
It's okay. I already told him.

06:09.349 --> 06:12.283
Tell him what you said.

06:12.319 --> 06:13.318
[Whispers] It's okay.

06:13.353 --> 06:17.789
I'm sorry. I was just pretending.

06:22.262 --> 06:23.528
No.

06:23.563 --> 06:25.163
Tell Daddy the truth

06:25.198 --> 06:28.800
about how we've been playing with Drill.

06:30.337 --> 06:34.939
[Sighs] I was just trying to
make you feel better, Mommy.

06:34.975 --> 06:38.476
I know how much you
wanted to talk to Drill,

06:38.512 --> 06:42.480
so I just made it up. I'm sorry.

06:42.549 --> 06:44.782
I think...

06:44.818 --> 06:48.086
We all just need some rest, okay?

06:56.763 --> 06:59.764
[Switch clicks, door closes]

07:02.202 --> 07:05.537
- She's lying.
- What makes you think she's lying now and not before?

07:05.572 --> 07:08.206
Did you ever hear Drill yourself?

07:08.241 --> 07:09.841
- No, but...
- So all you really know is

07:09.876 --> 07:13.344
what Minx told you he was saying, right?

07:13.380 --> 07:18.683
Look, isn't it possible that
she just made it up to...

07:18.718 --> 07:21.319
to get her mother's attention?

07:21.354 --> 07:23.888
I mean, look, we... we have
all been through a lot, okay?

07:23.924 --> 07:26.024
[Kisses] But it's over now, okay?

07:26.059 --> 07:29.093
Things will go back to normal.

07:29.129 --> 07:32.063
Let's go to bed. [Kisses]

08:13.273 --> 08:17.408
So Wes can reach us.

08:17.444 --> 08:19.944
It's not traceable.

[Phone beeps]

08:40.000 --> 08:40.999
You remember the last time

08:41.034 --> 08:43.433
we were in a hotel room together?

08:43.470 --> 08:47.739
New Year's Eve, two years ago.

08:47.774 --> 08:51.209
It was supposed to be
a getaway to reconnect.

08:51.244 --> 08:54.946
We both got food poisoning.

08:54.981 --> 08:57.415
It was a beautiful room, huge bed,

08:57.450 --> 09:01.285
and the two of us curled up
on the bathroom floor together,

09:01.321 --> 09:03.187
all night.

09:03.223 --> 09:06.557
You said the cold tile
would make us feel better.

09:06.593 --> 09:08.926

09:08.962 --> 09:10.662
You were right.

09:15.235 --> 09:20.772
Bath mats for pillows, robes for blankets.

09:20.807 --> 09:23.941
You know what I remember most?

09:23.977 --> 09:29.447
How we talked, almost the whole night.

09:29.482 --> 09:32.784
Somehow we stopped doing that...

09:32.819 --> 09:34.719
talking to each other.

09:34.754 --> 09:37.955
Maybe we just stopped listening.

09:37.991 --> 09:41.426
Maybe.

09:41.461 --> 09:45.129
But we made it through that night together.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.732
That's how we're gonna
make it through this.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.669
What is "making it through" mean, Sean?

09:56.342 --> 10:00.445
It means we're gonna be a family again.

- Hmm?

The research Agent
Bennigan ordered last week.

10:19.032 --> 10:20.364
I wasn't sure where to put it.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.300
I'll take it. Thank you.

[Cell phone vibrating]

Jessup? Is everything okay?

10:41.121 --> 10:42.820
Remember when you had
research look into case studies

10:42.856 --> 10:44.288
on imaginary friends?

10:44.324 --> 10:47.158
How you wanted to go beyond
what's in the FBI database?

10:47.193 --> 10:48.626
Yeah.

10:48.661 --> 10:50.061
Well, they pulled something
from a psychology journal

10:50.096 --> 10:52.897
about childhood disassociative disorders.

10:52.932 --> 10:54.132
And what does it say?

10:54.167 --> 10:55.900
Well, one of the subjects

10:55.935 --> 10:58.236
is an 8-year-old boy who reports talking to

10:58.271 --> 11:02.240
a friend named Drill, a,
uh, "malevolent presence

11:02.275 --> 11:05.810
- from another world, who speaks only to children."
- Malevolent?

11:05.845 --> 11:07.945
Sounds like he's the first
kid to see through Drill's act,

11:07.981 --> 11:10.314
who is he? How he is connected to the...

11:10.350 --> 11:12.150
It's not the <i> who</i> that's interesting here.

11:12.185 --> 11:13.918
It's the when.

11:13.953 --> 11:17.455
This article was written in 1982.

11:22.662 --> 11:25.463
Drill's been here before.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.036
Yeah, we're fine.

12:02.072 --> 12:03.705
Yeah, you need to lay low
a little while longer, okay?

12:03.740 --> 12:05.407
I'm still working on the secretary.

12:05.442 --> 12:10.979
Wes, listen, the secretary isn't
our biggest problem anymore.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.382
Drill survived.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.022
Wes?

12:21.192 --> 12:23.459
Lena tried to tell me the same thing.

12:23.495 --> 12:26.696
I... I didn't believe
her. Where are you now?

12:26.731 --> 12:29.465
[Sighs] We're in Delaware.

12:29.501 --> 12:30.867
What are you doing there?

12:30.902 --> 12:32.402
He could know everything.

12:32.437 --> 12:34.170
If he's known Drill for 30 years,

12:34.205 --> 12:35.939
he damn sure knows more

12:35.974 --> 12:37.607
- about what we're up against...
- Okay, do you have any idea where he is now?

12:37.642 --> 12:40.376
No, no, but Jessup was able
to track down an address

12:40.412 --> 12:42.011
for the kid's father.

12:42.047 --> 12:45.715
It's 115 Pine Crest Road in Hockessin.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.650
Be careful, okay? If
Drill is out there, then...

13:10.408 --> 13:12.475
I'm gonna be home soon, but until I am,

13:12.510 --> 13:14.477
I just want you and Minx to be careful.

13:14.512 --> 13:17.113
Maybe get out of the house,
get away from any electricity.

13:17.148 --> 13:22.418
Just... just call me when you get this.

13:26.780 --> 13:30.048
Mommy?

13:30.083 --> 13:32.950
I'm sorry I lied. But you lied to Drill.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.787
You promised you'd keep
our games with him a secret,

13:35.822 --> 13:39.090
but then you told Daddy.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.025
I don't want Drill to be mad at you.

13:41.061 --> 13:44.028
I want you to be friends.

13:44.064 --> 13:46.531
Honey, I don't think we should
be friends with Drill anymore.

13:46.566 --> 13:49.834
But Drill says he has an
important message for you.

13:53.339 --> 13:56.574
Why can't you just tell

message just for you.

14:42.956 --> 14:45.857
We'd like to speak with you about your son.

14:45.892 --> 14:49.827
Uh-oh.

14:49.863 --> 14:51.162
Greg done somethin' wrong?

14:51.197 --> 14:55.166
No. No, no, we're just
looking for some information.

14:55.201 --> 15:00.271
But I... I think we're
talking about an older son

15:00.306 --> 15:01.472
who participated in

15:01.508 --> 15:03.708
a psychological study back in 1982?

15:03.743 --> 15:04.842
Yeah, I'm sorry. This isn't a good time.

15:04.878 --> 15:07.011
- Why don't you come...
- Please, please.

15:07.046 --> 15:09.046
Please, I'm not asking
you as a federal agent.

Our son... has been speaking with Drill.

15:21.327 --> 15:25.096
Drill?

15:25.131 --> 15:27.532
Drill was Thomas' imaginary
friend. How is your son...

15:27.567 --> 15:29.000
He's not imaginary.

15:29.035 --> 15:31.435
He's real.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.807
There were rumors that
your domestic terror plot

15:35.842 --> 15:38.910
was recently foiled at the
Harbor Point nuclear plant.

15:38.945 --> 15:41.245
Well, Roger, it's, uh,
it's never a good policy

15:41.281 --> 15:42.480
to comment on rumors.

15:42.515 --> 15:45.316
Well, certainly people have
legitimate questions and concerns.

15:45.351 --> 15:47.385
I realize that, so so let me just say,

15:47.420 --> 15:49.554
there was no domestic terror plot foiled

15:49.589 --> 15:51.756
at the Harbor Point nuclear facility.

15:51.791 --> 15:54.358
This was simply a security exercise

15:54.394 --> 15:56.794

and conspiracy theorists

15:56.830 --> 15:58.095
might wanna believe.

- There is no kitten.

but Drill was wrong, sweetie.

18:59.377 --> 19:01.143
Thomas... he was the younger one.

19:01.178 --> 19:03.779
Eliot was two years older.

19:10.988 --> 19:14.156
working as an astronomer.

19:14.191 --> 19:17.459
And every day, when I came
home, the boys would ask,

19:17.495 --> 19:19.695
did I hear from the aliens today?

19:23.934 --> 19:26.468
As it so happens, in
the summer of '82, we...

19:26.504 --> 19:27.936
picked up a strange signal.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.872
What kind of signal?

19:29.907 --> 19:35.144
Narrowband radio from the
Chi Sagittarii star group.

19:35.179 --> 19:38.747
And when I told the
boys, they got so excited,

19:38.783 --> 19:41.517
Thomas especially.

19:41.652 --> 19:46.155
He said he wanted to meet them.

19:46.190 --> 19:47.390
A few weeks later, he came to me.

19:47.425 --> 19:51.460
He said the alien wasn't out there.

19:51.496 --> 19:57.533
He was already here in his head.

19:57.568 --> 20:02.671
Mr. Harcourt, what did Thomas do?

20:07.712 --> 20:11.647
Thomas, he, um...

20:11.682 --> 20:13.682
he killed his brother.

20:18.322 --> 20:22.391
Said Drill made him do it.

20:22.427 --> 20:24.126
Hey, Callie, where's Lena?

20:24.162 --> 20:25.961
She's at a doctor's appointment.

20:25.997 --> 20:28.264
She never mentioned an appointment to me.

20:28.299 --> 20:30.699
- Where's Minx?
- She's upstairs.

20:30.735 --> 20:33.903
What's wrong?

20:35.907 --> 20:40.943
Minx, honey, we need to talk.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.378
What's that stuff, Daddy?

20:42.413 --> 20:47.817
Cameras. Special cameras. So
we can see if Drill's here.

20:47.852 --> 20:52.188
- I told you, Drill isn't here anymore.
- Enough.

20:52.223 --> 20:54.290
I know that you lied to me about Drill

20:54.325 --> 20:55.624
and what you told your mommy.

20:58.229 --> 21:01.497
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

21:03.534 --> 21:06.936
It doesn't matter what Drill says anymore.

Okay? I need you to promise me
if he contacts you, you tell me.

any secrets anymore, all right?

21:16.047 --> 21:18.247

- Okay.

know something about Mommy.

21:24.188 --> 21:26.388

21:26.424 --> 21:29.692
I think she's gonna do something bad.

out to play in the woods

21:34.899 --> 21:35.965
down by Hanger's Pond.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.467
I told them to be back before it got dark

21:38.503 --> 21:40.936
'cause a storm was rolling in.

21:40.972 --> 21:45.608
Well, the storm came in...
thunder, lightning, hard rain,

21:45.643 --> 21:49.145

21:49.180 --> 21:51.914

21:56.521 --> 21:59.488
When I found Thomas,

21:59.524 --> 22:03.025
he came walking out from the
trees like he'd seen a ghost.

22:03.060 --> 22:06.028
Looked as if he was drenched to the bone.

22:06.063 --> 22:11.467

22:11.502 --> 22:15.104
It wasn't just rain he was soaked in.

22:15.139 --> 22:16.839
I'm so sorry.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.277
And what happened to Thomas... was he...

22:21.312 --> 22:25.181
Yes, he was, uh, sent to
the Rockwood Institution.

22:25.216 --> 22:27.850
It's a psychiatric facility.

22:27.885 --> 22:31.487
He spent 10 years there
before his emancipation.

22:31.522 --> 22:34.723
And then you had another son.

22:34.759 --> 22:37.259
You have to understand,
I didn't just lose Eliot,

22:37.295 --> 22:39.361
I lost both of my sons that night.

22:39.397 --> 22:45.434

you have for doing it,

paid more attention.

be able to find Thomas now?

28:01.441 --> 28:05.276
Get in the car, lock the
doors, and don't come out,

28:05.311 --> 28:08.379
not for anyone, okay?

28:08.414 --> 28:09.880
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.015
I love you.

28:11.050 --> 28:13.751
[Kisses]

28:27.233 --> 28:29.100
[Glass shatters]

28:46.619 --> 28:48.319
Power's out.

28:48.354 --> 28:50.955
Looks like someone forgot to
pay their electricity bill.

28:54.026 --> 28:55.693
It's not just that...

28:55.728 --> 28:57.661
no bulbs in any of the fixtures.

29:06.272 --> 29:08.773
No microwave, no toaster.

29:08.808 --> 29:10.941
Not even any appliances.

29:10.977 --> 29:13.377
He doesn't want any
electricity in the house.

29:14.847 --> 29:16.380
[Door creaks]

29:28.361 --> 29:31.796
I've seen this.

29:31.831 --> 29:33.164
Harper drew the same thing in her treehouse

29:33.199 --> 29:36.133
right before her mom fell through.

29:39.672 --> 29:41.939
[Door squeaks]

29:47.880 --> 29:51.415
[Thunder rumbling]

30:44.804 --> 30:47.571
It's him...

30:47.607 --> 30:49.707
and his brother.

30:49.742 --> 30:51.408
[Floorboard creaks overhead]

31:00.887 --> 31:01.986
Thomas...

31:02.021 --> 31:04.388
Thomas, we just wanna talk to you.

31:16.986 --> 31:18.419
<i>Female automated voice:

31:18.454 --> 31:22.056
<i>.6 miles ahead. Proceed forward.</i>

31:26.429 --> 31:27.661
[Beep]

31:27.697 --> 31:29.196
<i>Wes: Lena, whatever
you think you're doing,</i>

31:29.232 --> 31:30.664
<i>whatever reasons you think
you have for doing it,</i>

31:30.700 --> 31:33.500
<i>just please don't. Just call me.</i>

31:33.536 --> 31:37.238
I can't do this.

31:37.273 --> 31:39.373
God, I can't do this.

31:39.408 --> 31:41.375
- [Knock on window]
- [Gasps loudly]

31:41.410 --> 31:45.512
[Windshield wipers clacking]

31:45.548 --> 31:47.615
Are you okay?

31:47.650 --> 31:50.818
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:50.853 --> 31:52.119
Are you sure?

31:52.154 --> 31:54.755
Yes, thank you.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.691
Then why aren't you doing it?

31:57.727 --> 32:00.661
What?

32:00.696 --> 32:02.930
My friend says you need to hurry.

32:02.965 --> 32:04.632
You're running out of time.

32:17.113 --> 32:19.713
Now she's moving again,
leaving the gas station.

32:19.749 --> 32:21.348
Stay on 95.

32:27.456 --> 32:30.424
We just wanna talk to you.

32:30.459 --> 32:33.928
- Are you from the hospital?
- No.

32:33.963 --> 32:36.664
I don't need the medicine. I don't need it.

32:36.699 --> 32:38.499
No, we're not from the hospital.

32:38.534 --> 32:40.234
Then who are you?

32:40.269 --> 32:45.005
[Whispers] We're wasting time.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.674
[Gun cocks]

32:46.709 --> 32:47.741
Wait.

32:53.716 --> 32:57.785
You wanna know who I am, Thomas?

32:57.820 --> 32:59.219
I'm just like you.

32:59.255 --> 33:02.289
Drill made me do things,

33:02.325 --> 33:06.961
bad things, things that
made people think I was

33:06.996 --> 33:08.629
someone I'm not.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.000
Even the people that
cared about me the most,

33:13.035 --> 33:16.103
the people that loved me,
not even they believed me.

33:16.138 --> 33:20.074
But I... I couldn't blame them.

33:20.109 --> 33:22.810
How could I? I... I sounded crazy.

33:22.845 --> 33:25.746
I'm not crazy.

33:25.781 --> 33:27.348
We know you're not.

33:27.416 --> 33:29.683
Because if you are...

33:31.620 --> 33:33.287
then we are.

33:40.029 --> 33:42.363
[Lock clicks]

33:42.398 --> 33:45.265
[Door creaking]

33:49.772 --> 33:51.705
How did you find me?

33:51.741 --> 33:54.274
[Thunder rumbling]

33:54.310 --> 33:56.877
[Indistinct whispering]

33:56.912 --> 33:59.346
[Lock clicking]

34:04.887 --> 34:06.420
[Electricity crackles]

34:08.391 --> 34:10.391
[Crackling continues]

34:10.426 --> 34:13.659
[Indistinct whispering continues]

34:13.696 --> 34:15.896
We were the ones who called him here.

34:15.931 --> 34:19.333
We just didn't know it.

34:19.368 --> 34:21.467
What do you mean, "we called him"?

34:21.504 --> 34:26.907
"Now I am become death.

34:26.942 --> 34:31.911
Destroyer of worlds." The quote.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.847
People said it was Oppenheimer.

34:33.882 --> 34:35.248
Actually, it's from the "Bhagavad gita,"

34:35.284 --> 34:38.152
but it expressed how Oppenheimer felt

34:38.187 --> 34:40.420
after realizing what
completing the atomic bomb

34:40.456 --> 34:43.157
really meant for our world.

34:43.192 --> 34:45.692
I'm sorry.

34:45.728 --> 34:49.228
I don't understand.

34:49.264 --> 34:51.998
It's all right here.

34:52.034 --> 34:56.235
Between 1945 and 1982,

34:56.272 --> 35:01.175
there were over 1,703 nuclear
tests around the world.

35:01.210 --> 35:07.214
Each explosion sent a trail
of energy way out into space.

35:07.249 --> 35:10.184
Over time, we created a beacon.

35:10.219 --> 35:12.619
And they just followed it here.

35:12.655 --> 35:14.822
They even sent back a signal of their own.

35:14.857 --> 35:18.392
My father was the one who picked it up.

35:21.363 --> 35:23.897
And it happened soon after that.

35:23.933 --> 35:26.467
What?

35:26.502 --> 35:31.138
That's when the whispers started.

35:31.173 --> 35:33.907
[Muffled voice] Somebody help me!

35:33.943 --> 35:36.176
Thomas: They said he was dying.

35:36.212 --> 35:39.546
Not just him... his whole planet.

35:39.582 --> 35:42.716
The energy they need to live
off of is almost all gone,

35:42.751 --> 35:44.885
so they sent Drill out,

35:44.920 --> 35:46.954
after that beacon of heat coming from us.

35:46.989 --> 35:49.490
When he got here,

35:49.525 --> 35:52.059
he realized only the kids could hear him.

35:52.094 --> 35:54.528
Any idea why he chose to speak to you?

35:54.563 --> 35:59.166
He needed a way to send a
signal back to the others.

35:59.201 --> 36:02.069
And your father worked
with signals... satellites.

36:02.104 --> 36:03.770
But I knew.

36:03.806 --> 36:09.576
I knew what would happen if
Drill sent that signal out.

36:13.349 --> 36:16.383
[Vehicle approaches]

36:20.156 --> 36:21.288
Oh, she stopped again.

36:21.323 --> 36:24.191
217 Spruce Street, same as Sean and Claire.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.859
- How far out are we?
- Three minutes.

36:27.563 --> 36:30.430
Sean: Thomas, does
Drill still speak to you?

36:30.466 --> 36:33.367
The doctors said I just
stopped hearing the whispers

36:33.402 --> 36:36.203
because the medication was working.

36:38.507 --> 36:41.542
But you and I know better.

36:41.577 --> 36:45.379
We know better about what?

36:48.384 --> 36:50.884
When did he stop talking to you?

36:50.920 --> 36:53.654
It doesn't matter.

36:53.689 --> 36:58.525
Thomas, we are here because
we wanna help our son.

36:58.561 --> 37:00.727
We want Drill to leave him alone,

37:00.763 --> 37:04.965
and anything that you can tell
us Drill is talking to your son?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.134
And other kids, too.

37:07.169 --> 37:09.069
No, that's not possible.

37:09.104 --> 37:10.571
That...

37:14.043 --> 37:17.144
They must've sent another one to find us.

37:17.179 --> 37:19.680
What... what if he followed you?

37:19.715 --> 37:20.747
- Thomas...
- You have to leave!

37:20.783 --> 37:22.649
- Thomas... you...
- I can't...

37:22.685 --> 37:24.318
- Thomas...
- I don't wanna hear him again!

37:30.993 --> 37:32.526
[Door handle rattling]

37:32.561 --> 37:33.727
[Muffled voice] Mom!

37:36.616 --> 37:37.915
Thomas, you have to relax.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.216
What... what do you mean another one?

37:39.252 --> 37:40.651
- Another Drill?
- That's the only way!

37:40.687 --> 37:41.652
The only way that what?

37:41.688 --> 37:43.854
If your son is talking to him now,

37:43.890 --> 37:46.290
- he can't <i> be</i> the same friend I had.
- Why not, Thomas?

37:46.325 --> 37:48.225
Because I killed him!

37:48.261 --> 37:51.362
- I killed Drill.
- [Whispers] What?

37:51.397 --> 37:53.097
I had to stop him.

37:54.901 --> 37:56.467
[Tires screech]

38:00.006 --> 38:02.573
How? How did you kill Drill?

38:02.608 --> 38:05.142
[Door opens]

38:05.178 --> 38:06.944
Lena.

38:06.979 --> 38:09.880
- No!
- [Gunshots]

38:09.916 --> 38:10.981
[Muffled voice] No!

38:32.438 --> 38:36.507
[Indistinct whispering]

38:39.545 --> 38:41.879
Lena!

38:43.950 --> 38:47.051
[Electricity crackling]

38:47.086 --> 38:48.352
- Lena?
- I had to.

38:48.387 --> 38:49.720
Okay.

38:52.658 --> 38:53.657
Claire?

38:59.265 --> 39:00.297
Hey.

39:04.871 --> 39:06.837
[Door opens]

39:08.708 --> 39:11.208
- Mom? Dad?
- Henry, turn around. Don't look, son.

39:11.244 --> 39:12.476
- Mom?
- She's fine.

39:12.512 --> 39:15.112
Sean, get him outta here.

39:17.617 --> 39:18.682
Thomas.

39:18.718 --> 39:22.887
Thomas, can you hear me?

39:22.922 --> 39:24.388
Thomas, look at me.

39:26.893 --> 39:30.127
Lena, give me the gun. Give me the gun.

39:30.163 --> 39:33.230
- It's okay. It's okay.
- [Gun clicks]

39:33.266 --> 39:38.135
Okay? Now, look, what happened?

39:38.471 --> 39:42.373
He... he lured her out on the roof.

39:42.408 --> 39:45.075
There was a power line...

39:45.111 --> 39:46.310
[Whispers] What was I gonna do?

39:46.345 --> 39:48.946
- Wes, she's our little girl.
- Lena, I know, I know.

39:48.981 --> 39:50.948
It's gonna be okay.

39:50.983 --> 39:54.985
All right, sit down. Sit down, sit down.

39:55.021 --> 39:56.554
[Groaning] It's okay.

39:56.589 --> 39:58.189
There's no exit wound.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.459
We need to get something
to stop this bleeding.

40:02.495 --> 40:04.595
Get it, get it, get it, I got it.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.530
Lena? Lena?

40:06.566 --> 40:08.132
I got this.

40:08.167 --> 40:12.203
I will make it okay, all right? Promise.

40:12.238 --> 40:14.305
Thomas, look at me.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.674
- Look at me.
- His pressure's dropping.

40:16.709 --> 40:18.509
No, no.

40:18.544 --> 40:20.444
Thomas...

40:20.479 --> 40:25.015
Look at me. I need to know, please.

40:25.051 --> 40:27.918
I need to know.

40:27.954 --> 40:29.320
- How did you do it? How did you do it?
- Stop.

40:36.495 --> 40:39.763
How did you do it? How
did you do it, Thomas?

40:39.799 --> 40:41.565
Please. Wes!

40:41.601 --> 40:43.734
Hello, Wes?!

40:43.769 --> 40:47.571
- Okay, I got this. I got it.
- [Panting]

40:47.607 --> 40:49.540
We can't take him to a
hospital with a gunshot wound.

40:49.575 --> 40:50.574
They'll have to report it to the police.

40:50.610 --> 40:54.345
I understand, Wes, but he knows.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.313
He knows how to kill Drill.
