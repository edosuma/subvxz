WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:03.637
(car horn honks)

00:03.671 --> 00:06.374
(siren wailing)

00:19.420 --> 00:21.555
LINDSAY:
So you were
on the case back then?

00:21.589 --> 00:25.326
TAYLOR:
Yeah, the chief of detectives
put together a task force.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.129
There were over a dozen
detectives temporarily assigned.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.198
I was one of them.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.400
Tommy was eight years
old when he disappeared.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.337
Been begging his
parents for a long time

00:36.370 --> 00:38.239
to let him walk
the dog by himself.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.441
They finally gave in.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.119
That was his house.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.193
Okay, don't talk to
anyone you don't know.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.694
Straight to the park
and straight back,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.830
and as soon as Leo is
done doing his business,

01:02.863 --> 01:05.433
you come right home,
you understand?

01:05.465 --> 01:06.500
Tommy, are you
listening?

01:06.534 --> 01:08.536
Yes, Mom.
I won't talk to strangers

01:08.569 --> 01:10.438
and I'll come right back
when Leo's done.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.405
I promise.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.274
Love you.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.708
FATHER:
Tommy, make sure you
use the crosswalks.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.245
MOTHER:
Love you.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.680
That was the last
time they saw him.

01:19.713 --> 01:24.318
They promised each other
they'd never move.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.421
They believe his soul is
still with them in the house.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.871
The owner of this
store saw Tommy

01:43.904 --> 01:46.140
right after he
left the house.

01:46.174 --> 01:49.177
He gave him a quarter
to buy a lollipop

01:49.210 --> 01:50.844
in that candy store
down the street.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.715
Thanks.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.453
The clerk in the candy store
remembered Tommy coming in

01:59.487 --> 02:00.421
to buy the lollipop.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.756
LINDSAY:
So an eight-year-old
boy goes missing

02:02.790 --> 02:04.758
in a tight-knit neighborhood
like this.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.361
There had to have been
dozens of tips.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.262
Hundreds.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.497
Did any of them pan out?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.931
It always came back

02:10.964 --> 02:12.833
to Keith Milner.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.602
He lived up there.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.605
He was 17 at the
time, real bad seed.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.873
Whenever he wasn't
terrorizing the neighborhood,

02:19.907 --> 02:23.444
he sat on
that fire escape smoking dope.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.280
See that guy
right there?

02:26.314 --> 02:29.217
He's the last person
to see Tommy alive.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.723
*

02:37.991 --> 02:40.528
The whole precinct was
out looking for Tommy.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.695
Four hours later

02:41.729 --> 02:45.233
unis found Milner
in the park,

02:45.266 --> 02:48.636
high on angel dust,
holding Tommy's puppy, and

02:48.669 --> 02:50.871
he had Tommy's blood
on his jacket.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.607
So, did Milner ever
make a statement?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.609
By the time the
angel dust wore off

02:55.643 --> 02:57.811
and he was coherent
enough to talk,

02:57.845 --> 03:00.814
his parents were at the
precinct with a lawyer.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.651
Without a statement,
a body, or a witness,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.553
we never had enough
to charge him.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.820
Thank you.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.223
LINDSAY:
So, where'd Milner go
after that?

03:09.257 --> 03:12.493
TAYLOR:
There were a lot of
angry people around here.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.662
Death threats against
Keith and his family.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.797
They were eventually
forced to move away.

03:16.830 --> 03:21.435
Looks like someone welcomed
him back to the neighborhood.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.595
* Out here in the fields

03:47.628 --> 03:51.532
* I fight for my meals

03:51.565 --> 03:55.936
* I get my back into my living

03:58.572 --> 04:00.641
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.517
(siren wailing)

04:22.663 --> 04:26.033
Somebody threw him a beating
before cutting his throat.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.668
Still has his wallet
and jewelry.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.537
LINDSAY:
Keith Milner,

04:29.570 --> 04:33.040
the only suspect in the
disappearance of Tommy Lewis,

04:33.073 --> 04:34.442
is found dead in the park

04:34.475 --> 04:36.344
a block away from
where the kid vanished

04:36.377 --> 04:38.312
exactly 20 years
ago today.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.314
My guess is, this about payback,

04:40.348 --> 04:41.549
not a payday.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.616
I'm sure there's still
a lot of people

04:42.650 --> 04:44.685
in this neighborhood
who'd love to see him dead.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.020
Probably most of all
Tommy's parents.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.823
I'm curious to hear how they'd
take the news of his murder.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.659
That's if it's news
to them at all.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.463
("I Don't Owe You a Thang"
by Gary Clark Jr. playing)

05:15.983 --> 05:19.953
* Well, I ain't got no money

05:19.987 --> 05:22.122
* No fancy car

05:22.155 --> 05:24.525
* Ain't got no excuses, baby

05:24.558 --> 05:26.694
* Hangin' at the bar

05:26.727 --> 05:30.964
* I don't owe you a thang, baby,
I don't owe you a thang *

05:30.998 --> 05:32.833
* I don't owe you
a thang, baby *

05:32.866 --> 05:34.902
* I don't owe you a thang

05:34.935 --> 05:38.506
* Well, we ain't
getting married *

05:38.539 --> 05:40.808
* I ain't buying you
no diamond ring *

05:40.841 --> 05:43.010
* That's all right.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.113
(turns off music)

05:46.146 --> 05:48.348
Come and get it, sweetie.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
There you are, sleepyhead.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.039
Grace.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.708
*

06:25.786 --> 06:29.122
* I traveled through the night,
hopin' to find my peace *

06:29.156 --> 06:33.761
* You see these words collide,
waitin' for someone like me *

06:33.794 --> 06:37.064
* I know you're waitin' now,
I know you're waitin' now *

06:37.097 --> 06:40.868
* I know you're waitin' now,
it's time to believe *

06:40.901 --> 06:44.805
* Yeah, I'm fallin'

06:44.838 --> 06:48.809
* Wait for the moment

06:48.842 --> 06:52.145
* Said what you wanted

06:52.179 --> 06:53.814
* To me

06:53.847 --> 06:57.084
* While you stole
the world from me *

06:57.117 --> 07:00.988
* I know you're waitin' now,
it's time to believe... *

07:01.021 --> 07:02.122
(grunting)

07:02.155 --> 07:04.892
(indistinct chatter)

07:04.925 --> 07:06.560
MAN:
Come on, come on!

07:06.594 --> 07:08.428
(grunting)

07:09.897 --> 07:11.899
(distorted grunting)

07:11.932 --> 07:13.567
Don't let
that chump off easy, man!

07:13.601 --> 07:15.903
(grunting continues)

07:15.936 --> 07:17.237
Oh, yeah,
work it!

07:17.270 --> 07:18.806
(grunting)

07:18.839 --> 07:20.107
(bell clanging)
Whew!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
MAN:
That-a-boy, Flack.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.912
All right... good work.
Whoo.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.850
You hit me so hard
with that right hand,

07:29.883 --> 07:32.853
I was gonna call your parole
officer and have you violated.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.922
That's why I let up at the end.
Come on.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.857
(laughs)
You beat me up
the whole fight,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.726
but I got you fair
and square right there.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.628
Seriously, man,
you've come a long way.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.096
Three months ago, that punch
would've put you on your ass.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.932
You're learning to relax in
the ring, keep your composure.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.767
You're just saying nice things
to keep me coming back,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.769
because you like getting
paid to hit a cop.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.037
Hey, you know I love you, Flack.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.204
I know you love hitting me.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.840
See you next week same time?
Yes, sir.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.041
All right.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.779
(phone ringing)

08:02.550 --> 08:03.884
Hey, baby.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.119
Last night was amazing--
I can't stop thinking about you.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.921
You were incredible.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.690
Grandma? (gasps)

08:09.723 --> 08:11.559
Oh, sorry.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.061
Yes, I knew it was you.
(laughs)

08:14.094 --> 08:15.829
I'm sorry.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.064
What?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.932
Yeah, today's my day off.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.001
Anything for you.
What do you need?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.036
*

08:40.020 --> 08:42.556
DANVILLE (sighs):
Hey, Sid.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.758
Hey, Jo. You know,
there have been

08:44.792 --> 08:47.961
a number of times over the years
when unidentified remains

08:47.995 --> 08:49.897
of a male child
about Tommy Lewis' age

08:49.930 --> 08:51.565
have come through this morgue,

08:51.599 --> 08:55.235
and each time, we did
the DNA comparison to a sample

08:55.268 --> 08:58.071
provided by Tommy's parents,
hoping we'd be able

08:58.105 --> 09:00.107
to give them some closure.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.174
And now,

09:01.208 --> 09:03.644
lying dead on this table
is possibly

09:03.677 --> 09:05.112
the one man who knew

09:05.145 --> 09:07.114
the fate of that child.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.049
(wry laugh)
What can you tell me

09:09.082 --> 09:10.217
about Keith
Milner's murder?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.954
He was very healthy
and well nourished.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.125
No signs of recent or chronic
drug abuse or disease.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.360
That's surprising.
From all the reports I read,

09:20.393 --> 09:23.997
Milner had quite
the drug problem back
when Tommy went missing.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.966
He appears to have
kicked the habit.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.269
The mortal wound to the neck
is a shallow laceration

09:29.302 --> 09:31.972
that completely dissected
the jugular vein.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.675
The blade was short,
sharp and narrow.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.044
Sounds like a straight razor,
some kind of box cutter?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.779
Whatever the instrument,

09:38.812 --> 09:41.982
it looks like this substance

09:42.015 --> 09:45.085
was transferred from the blade
into the wound tract.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.687
Single slash wound.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.956
Whoever did this went
right for the kill.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.158
And it wasn't the first time
Mr. Milner

09:51.191 --> 09:53.026
was attacked last night.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.261
The discoloration
under the epidermis

09:54.294 --> 09:55.963
around the orbital bones

09:55.996 --> 09:58.966
and clotting around the wound
above the eye

09:58.999 --> 10:01.268
tell me...
he suffered these injuries

10:01.301 --> 10:04.204
at least a couple of hours
before he was murdered.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.372
Take a look here.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.707
I was surprised

10:06.740 --> 10:09.042
at the absence

10:09.076 --> 10:11.679
of typical defensive wounds
on the arms and hands.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.714
He didn't put up
much of a fight.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.182
So the question is:

10:15.215 --> 10:17.851
did the person that
attacked Milner earlier

10:17.885 --> 10:18.986
go back and finish the job,

10:19.019 --> 10:21.722
or did he run into someone else?

10:21.755 --> 10:24.391
Hmm.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.826
DANNY:
Milner hasn't had so much as

10:25.859 --> 10:27.127
a parking ticket
in the last 20 years.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.230
How is it possible
that a guy who murdered
an eight-year-old boy

10:30.263 --> 10:33.166
turns into this
model citizen?
All right.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.370
Maybe Milner wasn't the guy
that everyone thought he was.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.006
What do you mean?

10:39.039 --> 10:41.174
There were a lot of bosses
and experienced detectives

10:41.208 --> 10:43.010
calling the shots on that case.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.145
No one was very interested
in the...

10:45.178 --> 10:47.047
opinion of a young detective.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.750
It always
bothered me that

10:49.783 --> 10:51.819
he was the only suspect
from day one.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.854
He was the perfect guy for them.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.989
Everything fit.
It did, though, right?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.725
I mean, I looked
over the reports

10:57.758 --> 10:59.326
of the original
missing persons case.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.095
I mean, Milner was no angel--
assault, burglary.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.132
He had over a dozen arrests
before Tommy disappeared.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.299
And not for nothing, Mac.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.301
Milner had Tommy's blood
on his jacket

11:08.335 --> 11:10.003
when the cops found him.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.972
Yeah, but Tommy's blood
was also on the puppy,

11:12.005 --> 11:14.041
and it was never determined
whether the blood

11:14.074 --> 11:15.976
was transferred from the jacket
to the dog

11:16.009 --> 11:18.045
or the dog to the jacket.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.849
All right, well, if he didn't
kill Tommy, who did?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.984
DANVILLE:
Lewises are in the wind.
Neighbors say

11:24.017 --> 11:25.118
their car
has been gone

11:25.152 --> 11:25.919
since early this morning.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.021
Mr. Lewis works
at a print shop

11:28.055 --> 11:29.823
overnight in the
neighborhood.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.125
Took his lunch break at
2:00 a.m. and never came back.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.827
Lovato's out looking for him.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.762
I mean, you think Tommy's father

11:34.795 --> 11:36.730
might have actually killed
Milner himself?

11:36.764 --> 11:38.098
Milner shows up
in the neighborhood

11:38.131 --> 11:40.300
at the 20th anniversary
of his kid's death.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.002
Certainly has motive.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.004
Well, motive is fine, but,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.073
until we're done
analyzing the evidence,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.341
we've got nothing
to go at them with.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.112
Danny, do you mind
giving us a minute?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.147
No, sure.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.853
What's on your mind?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.521
I'm not quite sure
how to say this,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.091
and I might be overstepping
my bounds.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.859
But you're gonna say it anyway.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.094
I am.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.462
You've been back to work
for over a month.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.032
And I've been going through
Leonard Brooks' arson case,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.967
prepping for court.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.836
There were 200 reports
in that folder,

12:15.869 --> 12:18.271
and not one of 'em
has been written by you.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.040
And every court date you've had,

12:20.073 --> 12:23.176
you've had someone else
take your notes and testify.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.479
That's just not like you, Mac.
What's going on?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.081
You're right.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.317
You're overstepping your bounds.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.088
Mac, if something's wrong...

12:35.122 --> 12:36.223
Nothing's wrong.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.126
Just doing what I should have
been doing all along.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.560
I'm delegating.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.462
That's what bosses do.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.200
I'm just used to you
leading from the front.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.301
I'm wondering if...

12:48.335 --> 12:50.503
Stop wondering. I'm fine.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.005
Anything else?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.041
No.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.108
Nothing.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.144
Okay.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.084
You know...

13:04.117 --> 13:05.485
I might be a bit quirky,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.955
I may not be as organized
as I would like,

13:07.988 --> 13:10.057
but don't let that fool you.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.159
I'm incredibly perceptive.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.531
FLACK:
Turn the water on.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.969
(water running)

13:25.505 --> 13:27.274
Well...

13:27.307 --> 13:28.408
this...

13:28.441 --> 13:29.576
is a mystery.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.178
All your connections are tight,

13:31.211 --> 13:32.412
nothing's leaking.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.181
So...

13:34.214 --> 13:36.917
how do you think this water
got in the bucket that you put

13:36.950 --> 13:39.152
under the sink because
you supposedly had a leak?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.954
You're the detective.
You figure it out.

13:40.988 --> 13:41.821
Doesn't take

13:41.855 --> 13:43.556
Sherlock Holmes
to figure this one out.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.092
Uh-huh. I need you
to open the pickles.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.994
What?
The pickles.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.528
I can't open 'em.
I need you to loosen the top.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.529
You're the only one

13:49.562 --> 13:50.563
who lives here, right?

13:50.597 --> 13:52.132
You opened the jar.
How is it

13:52.165 --> 13:53.433
you can't close it-- are you
stronger than yourself?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.135
Sometimes.
(jar lid clinks)

13:55.168 --> 13:56.369
I love you, Gram.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.939
(door shuts)

13:58.972 --> 14:00.941
Hey.
Yo.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.310
(quietly):
You here for the mystery leak?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.113
Yeah, and to open some jars.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.115
I got you.
What are you
doing here?

14:08.148 --> 14:10.350
Don't you play senile
with me. You called me.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.620
And you set the
table for three.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.888
Hmm.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.423
Hey! Don't do that.
Ooh!

14:16.456 --> 14:18.358
See, they're hot. See?
Ah! Ooh. Oh!

14:18.391 --> 14:21.028
The two of you are so bad.
Mmm.
Mmm.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.163
Are you gonna eat now
when we sit down

14:23.196 --> 14:25.298
to the table?
I'll eat your meatballs
four times over.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.936
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
(Italian accent): Grandma
makes the best meatballs.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.404
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
(singsongy): Grandma.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.241
Can I have another one?
You smart aleck. No!

14:34.274 --> 14:36.309
LOVATO:
We got an alarm on Lewis' cars.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.311
Uniforms posted
outside the house

14:38.345 --> 14:39.346
and both their jobs,

14:39.379 --> 14:40.647
teams canvassing the hood.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.882
Tell the boss we got
everything covered.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.921
Mrs. Lewis.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.223
Are-are you the one
who's looking for me?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.225
Yes.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.928
Um...
Hey, hey. Relax.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.997
Tell me what's wrong.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.199
I...

14:59.232 --> 15:02.235
I think that my husband
has done something terrible.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.309
I think that he killed
Keith Milner.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.484
MAN:
Baby.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.552
Are you there? Baby?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.254
I saw Milner.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.590
(crying):
I saw that son of a bitch...

15:23.623 --> 15:25.658
at the tavern.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.994
Why?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.162
Why? Why?

15:29.196 --> 15:30.663
(sobbing)

15:30.697 --> 15:33.266
He just walked in...

15:33.300 --> 15:34.634
and he sat down.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.270
Like it was nothing.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.538
(beep)

15:38.571 --> 15:40.240
And then it cut off.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.342
I kept trying to call him back,
but, uh,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.344
his phone just kept going
to voice mail.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.347
I've been driving around
for hours looking for him.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.648
Last night,

15:48.681 --> 15:51.218
he was drinking
before he went to work.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.253
He was really upset.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.423
I'm afraid... Do you think
that he might have...

15:56.456 --> 15:58.091
Mrs. Lewis, don't do
this to yourself.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.259
Just, just relax
right now.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.760
There's a lot of people
that are trying

16:00.793 --> 16:02.129
to find out
what happened.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.231
Okay?
Yeah.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.435
You know, every year, um...

16:08.468 --> 16:11.438
this day is tough.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.439
Love you.
Love you.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.573
All I remember is

16:13.606 --> 16:15.108
watching Tommy disappear

16:15.142 --> 16:16.409
down the street.

16:16.443 --> 16:20.247
But this year it was really bad.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.550
Has your husband been
in contact with Mr. Milner?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.318
No, of course not.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.088
Did he ever talk
about trying to...

16:28.121 --> 16:29.789
hurt Milner himself?
No.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.692
Nathan never talked
about trying to hurt anyone.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.695
I just... I want him
to come home.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.533
HAWKES:
Trace Sid pulled

16:40.567 --> 16:42.502
from the slice wound
on Milner's neck.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.536
Penicillium?

16:43.570 --> 16:44.871
Yes, green mold.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.341
I also found plant matter called
Urtica dioica, or green nettle,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.344
as well as traces of paraffin
and microcrystalline wax.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.313
Obviously whoever sliced
Milner's throat

16:53.346 --> 16:55.148
used that knife
for something else.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.716
What about the stain
on his jacket?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.285
LINDSAY:
Ink, the kind used

16:58.318 --> 17:00.287
in industrial printing presses.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.788
Mr. Lewis is a lithographer.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.223
He works on the press.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.790
And he was at the
shop last night.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.326
Were you able to get
a usable print?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.527
Not yet. Adam's working

17:07.560 --> 17:09.362
on pulling something together.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.564
Lewis was fingerprinted
for DWI

17:11.598 --> 17:13.433
in '98, so he'll have something

17:13.465 --> 17:14.567
to compare it to.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.502
I got a signal
on Nathan Lewis' cell.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.538
It's not moved
since I picked it up.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.414
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:34.521 --> 17:37.757
Mac, it's Mr. Lewis.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.103
(groaning)

17:55.575 --> 17:58.245
Is he dead?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.847
Did I kill the son of a bitch?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.654
Oh, no, Gram, come on.

18:07.687 --> 18:08.855
I'm stuffed.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.757
You look like one of those POWs.

18:11.858 --> 18:12.825
It's called being in shape.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.461
Skinny is not a shape.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.329
You still going

18:16.363 --> 18:17.397
with that boy?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.798
No, we broke up.
He was too clingy.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.533
I wanted to see other people.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.535
He's not a boy.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.536
He's a man.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.538
His name is Jimmy, and, uh,

18:25.572 --> 18:26.573
yeah,
we're still going out.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.440
All right. Hate to do it.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.609
I got to eat and run.
It's my day off.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.478
I got a few errands
to take care of.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.712
I'll help you clean up.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.613
Don, before you go,

18:33.646 --> 18:37.384
I got something I got
to give you and Sam.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.487
Okay.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.489
This is stuff that was left
in the house

18:42.522 --> 18:43.523
when your father passed.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.358
FLACK:
I thought we got everything.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.495
Well, the man who came to do
the inspection for the closing,

18:48.528 --> 18:51.231
he found it
in the corner of the attic.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.502
Oh, no way.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.537
This is great. Are you sure
you don't want this?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.440
I don't need any of it.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.809
You can take
that damn ugly urn, too.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.345
I thought we agreed that Dad
would want to be here with you.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.613
Dad is here with me,
right here.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.714
That's all I need.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.616
I got nowhere to put that thing.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.585
Don't look at me.
I don't want it.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.525
Wow. Sam, come over here
and check this out.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.759
This is amazing.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.561
There's a picture of us with Dad

19:21.594 --> 19:23.863
from that time he got
us down on the field

19:23.896 --> 19:25.598
to run around after the game.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.733
No thanks.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.469
Whatever it is, if it belonged
to Dad, it's all you.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.838
You gonna pull that "he loved
you more than me" crap again?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.641
I'm sorry I can't pretend
he was this wonderful guy.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.343
I'm not asking you
to pretend anything.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.813
You know what,
I can't do this again.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.915
You take the stuff.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.684
I'm good.

19:44.717 --> 19:48.388
I will see you at the
next leak under the sink.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.659
(door opens, closes)

19:52.692 --> 19:53.526
Let her be.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.662
She'll learn how
to forgive him someday.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.564
Thank God for you, Gram.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.766
I love you.
You love my meatballs.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.504
Dad, can I see
your policeman's badge?

20:37.537 --> 20:38.671
Be careful.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.007
It's not a toy.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.715
When I'm a policeman,

20:48.748 --> 20:50.817
I'm gonna arrest
all the bad guys.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.619
Easy there, officer.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.421
Let's not shoot up the place.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.888
Can I see it?

20:55.922 --> 20:59.359
Doctors don't have badges,
sweetheart.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.594
I already told you, Daddy,
I don't want to be a doctor.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.596
Please can I see it?

21:03.630 --> 21:06.366
Maybe later.
Here, eat your hot dog.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.302
MAN:
Welcome, baseball fans
to your New York Yankees...

21:09.336 --> 21:11.371
Get your scorecards
out, guys.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.939
The game's about to start.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.670
*

21:53.880 --> 21:55.882
(phone line ringing)

21:57.684 --> 22:01.020
Hey, Sam, it's me.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.889
I need you to come over.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.457
There's something
really important

22:04.491 --> 22:06.459
that I have to show you.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.996
(siren sounding)

22:10.029 --> 22:13.733
Seven years
after Tommy disappeared,

22:13.766 --> 22:18.638
the state declared him
legally dead.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.674
Do you know what it's like

22:21.708 --> 22:24.777
to bury an empty coffin?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.684
I'm sorry
for your loss, Mr. Lewis,

22:31.718 --> 22:33.720
but Keith
Milner is dead.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.422
"I don't remember,
I blacked out"--

22:35.455 --> 22:36.723
that's not gonna cut it.

22:36.756 --> 22:40.793
Your fingerprints
are all over his jacket.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.829
(rapid beeping)

22:42.862 --> 22:46.533
Not to mention his blood
all over your shirt.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.500
We get it.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.403
You wanted to avenge
the murder of your son.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.439
TAYLOR:
But if you
were man enough

22:52.472 --> 22:55.808
to kill him, be man enough
to take responsibility for it.

22:55.842 --> 22:59.846
I swear to you,
I don't know if I killed him.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.149
Look, I was

23:03.182 --> 23:06.586
so tired
of thinking about Tommy,

23:06.619 --> 23:07.987
I just...

23:08.020 --> 23:10.657
wanted to be numb.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.861
Bourbon, neat.

23:23.836 --> 23:27.807
NATHAN:
I thought my mind
was playing tricks on me.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.911
(sighs)

23:31.944 --> 23:35.782
Took him a second
to recognize me.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.528
(grunts)

23:48.561 --> 23:50.096
Please, Mr. Lewis.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.898
How dare you show your face
around here

23:51.931 --> 23:53.032
on this day?

23:53.065 --> 23:55.768
You son of a bitch!
(grunts)

23:55.802 --> 23:56.969
Please.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.838
I didn't kill Tommy.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.806
Shut up!
(grunts)

23:59.839 --> 24:01.908
Shut your mouth!

24:01.941 --> 24:05.545
I didn't... I didn't.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.879
(choking)
Why?

24:06.913 --> 24:10.182
Why would you hurt that
perfect little boy? Why?

24:10.216 --> 24:13.185
I didn't...
kill your little boy.

24:13.219 --> 24:17.056
(crying)

24:17.089 --> 24:18.858
(both panting)

24:20.693 --> 24:22.662
Please. Please.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.031
I didn't hurt him.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.969
I didn't. I didn't hurt him.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.972
(grunting)

24:33.005 --> 24:34.874
I don't know if he was alive...

24:34.907 --> 24:37.243
but I left him in that alley.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.181
Where did you go after that?

24:42.214 --> 24:46.252
The next thing
that I remember is...

24:46.285 --> 24:48.888
waking up in the cemetery

24:48.921 --> 24:51.624
on top of Tommy's grave.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.998
(car horn honks)

25:08.975 --> 25:10.977
Okay, Brian.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.550
I'm sorry you had
to come all the way down here

25:17.584 --> 25:18.985
under these circumstances.

25:19.018 --> 25:23.322
He wasn't the horrible man
people said he was.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.658
He didn't kill that boy.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.294
SID:
When did you
find out about

25:28.327 --> 25:31.097
the accusations
against your husband?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.833
After we'd been dating
for a few months.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.768
Keith wouldn't talk about it
with me.

25:35.802 --> 25:39.839
He just wanted to put
the whole thing behind him.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.974
And he said that if I thought
for a second

25:42.008 --> 25:43.576
he was capable
of such a thing,

25:43.610 --> 25:44.911
I should break it off
right there.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.946
I didn't.

25:49.048 --> 25:53.052
We were married
three years ago last week.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.087
(sniffles)

25:55.121 --> 25:57.590
And he's been
nothing but kind,

25:57.624 --> 26:00.292
decent and honest.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.361
LINDSAY:
Something brought
your husband

26:02.394 --> 26:04.263
to the neighborhood
last night.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.833
Do you have any idea
what that was?

26:06.866 --> 26:08.868
(sniffles)

26:11.203 --> 26:14.607
I think this is the answer
you're looking for.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.345
LINDSAY:
"As the child we're about
to bring into this world grows

26:19.378 --> 26:21.313
"inside the belly
of my beautiful wife,

26:21.347 --> 26:25.752
"anxiety over secrets of my past
grow on my conscience.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.319
"It tears at my heart to know

26:27.353 --> 26:29.121
"my parents went to their graves

26:29.155 --> 26:31.658
"believing I took
the life of that boy.

26:31.691 --> 26:35.194
"The lies and the manipulation,
the stealing and the drugs.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.528
Maybe I didn't deserve
their trust."

26:36.562 --> 26:39.866
KEITH:
I'm afraid that when I look
into the eyes of my son

26:39.899 --> 26:41.734
for the very first time,

26:41.768 --> 26:44.170
the joy of that moment
will be stolen from me

26:44.203 --> 26:48.407
by thoughts of Tommy Lewis
and his mom and dad wondering

26:48.440 --> 26:50.409
where their own son has gone.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.779
If I'm going to raise my boy
with integrity,

26:52.812 --> 26:56.315
if he can ever look up to me,
he has to know the truth.

26:56.348 --> 27:00.219
I have to clear my conscience
and my name.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.789
The world has already made up
its mind about me.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.391
"I have no choice but to face
the wolf in sheep's clothing,

27:05.424 --> 27:07.894
"compel him to step forward
and confess to the crimes

27:07.927 --> 27:10.196
for which
I was so wrongly accused."

27:10.229 --> 27:11.898
That's his last entry.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.399
TAYLOR:
If what he wrote is true,

27:13.432 --> 27:16.703
Keith Milner didn't kill Tommy
Lewis, and he knew who did.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.404
HAWKES:
If Milner went back
to the neighborhood

27:18.437 --> 27:20.439
to confront Tommy's killer,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.041
then the killer must
still live there.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.747
Hey. Hi.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.181
Thanks for coming.
Of course. What's up?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.850
You were so cryptic
on the phone.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.185
A million things were going
through my mind

27:33.219 --> 27:34.687
on the way over here.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.587
I'm sorry about that.

27:35.621 --> 27:38.024
I'm just a little concerned
about Mac.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.059
What do you mean?

27:42.294 --> 27:44.764
I think he's struggling
with some stuff.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.700
What makes you say that?

27:47.734 --> 27:51.437
Well, he's been avoiding
certain situations at work,

27:51.470 --> 27:56.308
particularly things where he has
to provide specific details.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.476
Like what?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.712
I've watched him
a bunch of times

27:59.746 --> 28:02.114
struggle to name
or identify an object,

28:02.148 --> 28:05.117
and he covers pretty well,
but...

28:05.151 --> 28:07.754
Lord, I feel like
I'm telling on him.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.956
I'm just worried about him.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.258
Have you noticed
anything like that?

28:15.327 --> 28:17.864
No.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.498
Not really. I mean,
he doesn't know

28:19.531 --> 28:21.400
where he left his keys
half the time,

28:21.433 --> 28:23.402
but that's just a man thing,
you know.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.436
They're a forgetful bunch.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.972
Because I think

28:26.005 --> 28:27.974
if you had noticed,
then maybe we could...

28:28.007 --> 28:29.175
No.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.442
I'm sorry.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.111
I mean, I'll keep an eye out.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.746
You know,
Mac's been through a lot,

28:33.780 --> 28:36.115
and I'm sure it's just him
settling back in.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.086
Probably just me worrying
when I shouldn't.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.766
You're not seriously
thinking of doing this?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.768
I am.

28:55.802 --> 28:58.404
But I need your help.

28:58.437 --> 29:01.073
That kid Zane

29:01.107 --> 29:04.310
that you used to make out with--
he works there doing security.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.845
He can get us in.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.848
(laughs)
I did not used
to make out with him.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.116
Oh, sorry.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.151
He used to make out with you.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.352
You're such an ass.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.421
I haven't seen that kid
in, like, ten years.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.790
Well, I bumped into him
two weeks ago on the subway.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.258
Talk to him.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.293
This guy would murder puppies
if you asked him to.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.162
Yeah, well,
I'm not asking him to.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.997
You know, to be
honest, it kind of

29:25.031 --> 29:27.466
pisses me off, Dad's still
trying to tell me what to do

29:27.499 --> 29:29.568
from an urn on a shelf
at Gram's place.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.537
Come on! Would you ease up
on him already?

29:31.570 --> 29:33.906
So maybe he was a little bit
tougher on you.

29:33.940 --> 29:37.009
It's only because he knew
you were twice as smart as I am.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.210
That is not true.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.545
It is true.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.612
I'm okay with that.

29:40.646 --> 29:44.050
Would you just stop trying
to make excuses for him?

29:44.083 --> 29:47.119
Yeah, I came to terms
with this a long time ago.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.555
Maybe I was just hard to love.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.824
Maybe he had trouble
relating to me.

29:51.858 --> 29:54.226
Whatever it is, I'm over it.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.863
I saw that guy cry once
in my whole life.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.130
The night
of your senior prom.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.598
You said you were sleeping
at Heather's house.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.100
He checked up on you.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.368
You weren't there.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.370
So he and I drove around

30:04.403 --> 30:07.907
all night looking for you.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.141
He was a wreck.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.444
Thinking the worst, as only
a New York City detective can.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.314
And when we didn't find you,
he bawled like a baby.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.517
He never said anything
about that to me.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.053
Maybe he was just trying
to keep the peace.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.223
When you came home
the next morning,

30:24.256 --> 30:26.492
he was just thankful
you were safe.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.494
Sam...

30:28.527 --> 30:30.963
he loved you.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.572
I got to get back to work.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.573
My car's at a meter.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.275
Hey, come on.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.912
Talk to Zane.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.579
I don't have a plan "B."

30:47.613 --> 30:49.248
(sighs)

30:49.281 --> 30:51.017
Um...

30:51.050 --> 30:53.219
I love you.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.427
(beep)

31:08.134 --> 31:09.335
(beeps)

31:09.368 --> 31:12.004
(knocking)

31:13.639 --> 31:14.640
Hey.
Hey.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.979
This is a surprise.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.081
Sorry to barge in on you
like this.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.682
I-I brought you something
from Piccolo.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.284
Oh.
Hope you're hungry.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.886
Oh, thank you.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.523
Do you trust me, Mac?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.627
You even have to ask me that?

31:35.661 --> 31:37.229
I think I do.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.967
Um, I had coffee
with Jo earlier.

31:42.001 --> 31:46.372
She's worried about you,
and I am, too.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.508
Well, I'll tell you what
I told her-- I'm fine.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.510
That's what I said,

31:51.543 --> 31:53.512
'cause our relationship
is based on trust,

31:53.545 --> 31:56.648
and if you had a problem,
you would have come to me

31:56.682 --> 31:59.085
and we would have worked
it out together, right?

31:59.118 --> 32:01.220
That's right.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.656
Except she's with you
a lot more than I am,

32:04.690 --> 32:08.294
and, um, she's very smart,

32:08.327 --> 32:10.096
and for her
to approach me was hard.

32:10.129 --> 32:12.731
She took a chance,
so I'm thinking

32:12.764 --> 32:14.566
there must be
something there.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.668
I just want you
to look me in the eye

32:16.702 --> 32:18.670
and tell me nothing's wrong.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.974
What the hell is
this, Christine?

32:22.008 --> 32:24.443
It's really simple.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.014
Just look me in the eye
and tell me.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.750
I don't appreciate my integrity
being called into question.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.086
I didn't come here
to question your integrity.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.256
I came here
because I care about you.

32:40.026 --> 32:43.695
All right, let's try this
another way.

32:43.729 --> 32:47.033
Tell me what this is called.

32:48.034 --> 32:51.003
Tell me what
this is called.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.141
HAWKES:
Hey, Mac, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

32:55.174 --> 32:57.176
but you're gonna want
to hear this.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.779
I apologize.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.780
Should I...?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.116
No, no.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.118
Christine was
on her way out.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.089
(sets food on desk)

33:13.592 --> 33:15.027
Come on.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.531
Microcrystalline wax,
paraffin,

33:19.565 --> 33:23.535
green nettle plant, and green
mold have one thing in common--

33:23.569 --> 33:26.505
a very rare, expensive cheese
called Flaming Nettle Gouda.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.639
It's imported from Italy

33:27.673 --> 33:30.476
and sold in a few cheese shops
and delis around the city.

33:30.509 --> 33:34.346
One of them is Ventri's
in the East Village.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.651
TAYLOR:
Ventri was the last person
to see Tommy alive.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.221
(door opens)

33:42.254 --> 33:44.490
Hey, what can I get you?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.125
Mitch Ventri?

33:46.158 --> 33:47.093
Yeah.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.094
I'd like to talk to you

33:48.127 --> 33:49.428
about the murder
of Keith Milner.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.731
Put down the knife and come out
from behind the counter.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.376
It's over.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.116
I'm sorry.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.650
I've done
some very terrible things.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.327
Tommy knew me.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.630
I'd seen him in the store
a bunch of times with his folks.

34:24.663 --> 34:28.167
That day was the first time
I ever saw him alone.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.467
Come here,
Foo-Foo, come here.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.469
Hi.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.603
Hey, Tommy,
how you doing, bud?

34:32.638 --> 34:33.472
Good.

34:33.505 --> 34:36.242
You out walking the dog
all by yourself?

34:36.275 --> 34:37.143
Yeah.
Wow.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.810
What do you got
on your lip there, buddy?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.347
You got a little something--
what is that?

34:41.380 --> 34:44.616
I told him I had a big box of
lollipops down in the basement,

34:44.650 --> 34:47.186
and he could pick one
if he wanted.

34:50.222 --> 34:53.324
He asked me
how much it was gonna cost.

34:53.359 --> 34:56.628
Okay, yeah, let's go down
in the basement, come on.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.839
(door closes)

35:07.873 --> 35:11.377
I didn't plan on hurting him.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.412
I really didn't.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.350
He started to call out to help,

35:18.384 --> 35:22.854
and... I panicked.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.890
I hit him.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.396
And he wouldn't stop yelling,
he just...

35:30.429 --> 35:31.930
And I hit him again.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.500
Then, I just kept hitting him.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.369
(Tommy screaming)

35:37.403 --> 35:39.605
LOVATO:
How many are there?

35:39.638 --> 35:41.807
How many other kids
are there, Mitch?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.746
There's none.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.716
No, no, I...

35:50.749 --> 35:51.950
I swear to you,
there's none.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.420
I, I thought
about it,

35:54.453 --> 35:55.854
but I never touched
a kid before that

35:55.887 --> 35:58.257
and I never touched one after.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.426
So where is he?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.461
Where's Tommy?

36:05.464 --> 36:07.466
He's still there.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.502
He's still in the basement.

36:19.445 --> 36:22.248
(camera shutter clicks)

36:48.940 --> 36:51.277
LOVATO:
So, Keith told his parents

36:51.310 --> 36:53.812
that he saw you take Tommy
into the basement.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.414
Why didn't they call the police?

36:55.447 --> 36:57.549
'Cause they didn't believe him.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.651
They took your word
over the word of their own son?

36:59.685 --> 37:00.886
I wish
I could tell you

37:00.919 --> 37:03.322
I had to convince them,
but I didn't.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.723
They were at the end
of their rope with Keith.

37:04.756 --> 37:05.691
I mean, he was using drugs,

37:05.724 --> 37:07.759
he was stealing
from half the neighborhood,

37:07.793 --> 37:09.361
including the Milners.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.530
So they'd been lied to
and manipulated so many times

37:11.563 --> 37:14.533
that they didn't believe
a word he said.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.893
Look, I know you think
I'm a monster,

37:41.927 --> 37:43.995
but I was good to a lot
of people in that neighborhood,

37:44.029 --> 37:45.597
especially the Milners.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.466
I gave 'em credit in my store,

37:47.499 --> 37:49.568
I lent them money
to pay rent sometimes

37:49.601 --> 37:51.503
when things were tight, and...

37:51.537 --> 37:53.572
they were my friends.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.377
(voice breaking):
They trusted me.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.432
(sighs)

38:20.466 --> 38:21.667
I've been coming
through that park every morning

38:21.700 --> 38:24.102
at 4:00 a.m.
for the last 27 years.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.971
I wake up early,
I go into the deli,

38:26.004 --> 38:28.540
I open it up,
I get it all set up for the day.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.675
Milner knew that.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.510
The whole neighborhood did.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.111
He was waiting for me.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.381
But he didn't want to hurt you.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.516
He just wanted to confront you,

38:37.549 --> 38:40.386
give you a chance
to come clean on your own.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.422
He should have just
left it alone.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.659
KEITH:
I have to talk
to you, Mr. Ventri.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.028
What do you want?

38:50.061 --> 38:51.797
You have to tell
what happened to Tommy.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.400
The Lewises deserve to know
what happened to their son.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.667
Get away from me.

38:55.701 --> 38:56.768
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.104
If you don't tell,
I will.

38:59.137 --> 39:02.374
I will tell everyone I can
until someone finally listens.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.581
(gasps)

39:09.615 --> 39:12.384
MITCH:
I didn't know what to do.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.454
I mean, I didn't want
any of this to happen.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.855
I'm not a bad person.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.890
No, you're the worst
kind of person.

39:18.924 --> 39:22.494
You look like us,
you walk and talk like us.

39:22.528 --> 39:25.063
But you know what,
Mitch Ventri?

39:25.096 --> 39:27.065
You're nothing like us.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.559
(garbled radio transmission)

39:56.127 --> 39:58.096
You sure
you don't want me

39:58.129 --> 40:00.165
to come with you to the Lewises'
to make notification?

40:00.198 --> 40:01.232
You stay here

40:01.266 --> 40:04.603
and help Danny and Sheldon
finish up downstairs.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.971
I'm so glad
you're finally able

40:06.004 --> 40:09.541
to bring this family closure
after all these years.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.542
See you back at the office.

40:10.576 --> 40:13.078
Jo.
Yeah.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.949
I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.085
Be careful where
you stick your nose.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.621
Stay out of my
personal business.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.743
Detective.

40:44.776 --> 40:49.214
I wanted to, uh, let you know
that we found your son.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.784
(gasps)

41:02.961 --> 41:05.030
Thank you.

41:35.026 --> 41:38.029
*

41:57.215 --> 41:59.217
(clattering)

42:03.922 --> 42:04.790
SAMANTHA:
Hey.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.693
(laughs)

42:07.726 --> 42:09.060
Oh.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.596
Scared you, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.731
Yeah.
Not funny.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.232
You know
you owe me big-time.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.233
Zane?

42:15.266 --> 42:16.234
(laughs)

42:16.267 --> 42:17.869
Beyond creepy.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.873
Do you remember what
switch he said it was?

42:21.907 --> 42:23.875
I don't know.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.276
Uh...

42:46.898 --> 42:48.900
I'm glad I came.

42:49.935 --> 42:53.672
I'm glad you came, too.

42:53.705 --> 42:58.944
* This time I don't know
where to begin *

42:58.977 --> 43:02.614
* This is the moment

43:02.648 --> 43:05.917
* I was looking for...

43:05.951 --> 43:08.787
This is for you, Pop.

43:08.820 --> 43:13.759
* Our words are bouncing
off the floor *

43:13.792 --> 43:18.329
* I hear them carry
in the distance *

43:18.363 --> 43:21.032
* Oh

43:21.066 --> 43:25.804
* You can find me

43:27.973 --> 43:29.941
* Just the way

43:29.975 --> 43:32.343
* You did

43:32.377 --> 43:37.348
* When this began...
