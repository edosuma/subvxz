Announcer:
Fxx presents

00:15.160 --> 00:16.890
you're the worst.

00:21.970 --> 00:25.510
Oh, god. Oh, shit!

00:25.540 --> 00:27.750
Uh-huh.

00:27.770 --> 00:29.640
I'm gonna come!
I'm gonna come!

00:29.680 --> 00:31.080
Um...
I'm gonna come.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.580
Why do you always announce it?

00:32.610 --> 00:34.740
What?
You always announce it.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.410
I do?
Always.

00:36.450 --> 00:37.490
I don't know.
I guess I just want

00:37.520 --> 00:38.860
everyone to be clear that, uh...

00:38.880 --> 00:41.250
That this is Gretchen's moment.
Yeah.

00:41.290 --> 00:43.030
Gretchen has the floor.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.090
Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.
Oh. Oh, yeah!

00:50.130 --> 00:51.590
I'm gonna...
No! Wait.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.160
Jesus. What?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.500
Gretchen has the floor!

00:54.530 --> 00:55.800
I don't know what to tell you.

00:55.830 --> 00:58.170
We can, you know, both.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.670
Like, at the same time?

00:59.710 --> 01:01.880
Why not?
I don't know.

01:02.870 --> 01:03.870
Will it be scary?

01:03.910 --> 01:05.940
I don't know. It might.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.050
Wait, I can't...
I can't stop it.
Oh, me neither.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.450
I can't stop it.
Here I...

01:20.730 --> 01:23.370
You were so quiet.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.300
You had the floor.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.560
Aw.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.370
*

01:35.540 --> 01:38.340
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:38.380 --> 01:41.150
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

01:41.180 --> 01:44.410
* gonna leave you anyway.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.090
Ow!

01:52.120 --> 01:53.420
Oh, stop.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.160
It's a soft case.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.870
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.370
Might take a second.
I'm gonna wash my legs.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.530
You mean shave your legs?
No.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.870
I'm sorry?

02:06.910 --> 02:10.220
Implying that you don't
usually wash your legs?

02:10.240 --> 02:11.410
No.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.610
You don't wash your legs?

02:12.640 --> 02:14.680
No way. What am I, a sucker?

02:14.710 --> 02:17.610
What, you take showers,
and you don't wash your legs?

02:17.650 --> 02:21.380
What am I gonna do, like,
bend down and wash my legs?

02:21.420 --> 02:22.790
Who has the time?

02:22.820 --> 02:26.720
Yesterday, you spent
two hours drawing a maze.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.760
Yeah. And how do you think I had
time to draw that sick-ass maze?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.700
No wonder you haven't
finished your book, jimbo.

02:31.730 --> 02:33.860
Too busy washing your legs.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.370
Yeah, it's book proposal.
And it's nearly done.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.470
Hey, I forgot to mention!

02:39.510 --> 02:42.150
Sam and the boys are having a
big secret reunion show tonight.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.910
You want to come?
Nope.

02:43.940 --> 02:45.140
It's a really important night.

02:46.110 --> 02:48.210
Free booze.
Yeah, I'll be there.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.160
Mm. Love you.

02:52.020 --> 02:55.230
What did you say?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.450
Oh, my god, are you serious?

02:57.490 --> 02:59.220
W-we said it.

02:59.260 --> 03:02.500
No way! I didn't say it!

03:02.530 --> 03:04.260
Uh, the night of Becca
and Vernon's party.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.670
We both said...
You said it first!

03:06.700 --> 03:08.560
I was blackout drunk!

03:08.600 --> 03:10.240
Why would you take anything
i said seriously?
I seriously think

03:10.270 --> 03:12.510
that you may have
a drinking problem.
I don't have a problem.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.680
You know what, I'm not
gonna let this bother me.
Maybe you have

03:14.710 --> 03:17.620
a "believing things
drunk people say" problem.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.240
I told you, from the beginning,
i don't believe in it.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.610
But you said it.
I might also have said

03:23.650 --> 03:25.980
that I don't have an opinion
on your pubic hair,

03:26.020 --> 03:27.840
or that I was gonna help
Edgar with his résumé.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.180
Doesn't make them true.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.270
Babe.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.540
Babe?

03:46.570 --> 03:48.370
Dude with his face
in my business.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.020
Edgar:
Uh, what's the matter?

03:51.040 --> 03:54.480
Just, um, you've been doing that
for, like, a half hour.

03:54.510 --> 03:57.350
Uh, uh, attention to detail.
It's an army thing...

03:57.380 --> 03:58.980
When are you gonna
do me already?

03:59.020 --> 04:02.700
I like making you feel good.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.320
Is this your way of apologizing

04:04.360 --> 04:06.470
for backing out of
moving in together?

04:06.490 --> 04:08.660
If so, forgiven.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.830
Anyway, who am i
to look a gift... whore?

04:11.860 --> 04:14.000
Gift head?
Gift mouth in the mouth.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.500
There it is.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.100
Okay.

04:25.410 --> 04:27.810
Narrator : For Mary,
it was one argument too many.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.350
Paul:
Lindsay!

04:31.120 --> 04:32.890
Lindsay, come out here!

04:32.920 --> 04:35.180
Man:
Your mother cannot stay indef...

04:37.060 --> 04:40.200
Oh. Okay, let me go put on
my biking spanx.

04:40.230 --> 04:43.440
No, honey. You don't understand.

04:50.470 --> 04:53.170
Being back in this house,
i realized

04:53.200 --> 04:55.340
I created a life apart from you.

04:55.370 --> 04:57.210
All my hobbies,

04:57.240 --> 04:58.720
my Internet activity,
my secret bank account...

04:58.740 --> 05:00.010
Your what now?

05:00.050 --> 05:03.790
All these separate things
created malignant distance

05:03.820 --> 05:07.090
between us.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.790
Lindsay: You're throwing away
all your nerd stuff?

05:09.820 --> 05:13.060
From this moment on,
my sole focus

05:13.090 --> 05:16.460
will be on things
we can do together.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.540
Ah-ah-ah.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.800
I have a very special evening
planned.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.950
My special night?
Tonight,

05:27.970 --> 05:30.370
we launch our life,
truly together.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.210
As a family.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.280
Family.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.750
*

05:48.290 --> 05:49.990
Edgar:
Breakfast...

05:50.030 --> 05:51.330
Tots.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.560
This is completely...

05:54.600 --> 05:56.000
Brilliant.

05:56.030 --> 05:58.830
Why have you just thought
of these now?

05:58.870 --> 06:01.070
I'm more creative
when I'm upset.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.550
Oh.

06:05.610 --> 06:07.240
I have a problem.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.280
Mm. Having a problem is
your defining characteristic.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.190
No, I have a real
problem. Um...

06:14.220 --> 06:17.190
Ever since they switched
some of my meds, I've been...

06:17.220 --> 06:18.990
Having a little trouble
in the bedroom.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.660
What, night screamings?
Sleep-to-rage?

06:21.690 --> 06:23.860
Waking up thinking,
"why am I here?

06:23.900 --> 06:26.170
Oh, right. Yeah,
I'm freeloading off Jimmy."

06:26.200 --> 06:28.970
No. Bed-room.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.310
Oh, my god! Jesus, man.
Are you serious?

06:33.340 --> 06:35.300
It's not like nothing happens,

06:35.340 --> 06:37.610
but more like it
starts to happen,

06:37.640 --> 06:40.010
then it gets halfway
there and is like...

06:40.050 --> 06:42.050
"Nope,
I'm going back to bed."

06:42.080 --> 06:46.050
I've gone years now successfully
never picturing your penis.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.880
And now... there it is.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.490
Just maybe try to...

06:52.520 --> 06:55.390
Kink it back into
working order, huh?

06:55.430 --> 06:58.140
What have you two tried? Latex?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.360
Smooshing?

06:59.400 --> 07:00.910
Medical play?
Size training?

07:00.930 --> 07:02.460
Cfnm? Funneling?

07:02.500 --> 07:03.470
Hazyface?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.630
Clit negging? Ladyboy?

07:04.670 --> 07:07.400
Nothing. Just regular.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.640
Well, then your penis
is clearly bored to death.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.320
Just try something.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.140
Maybe start with some light

07:14.180 --> 07:15.640
role-playing.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.190
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna try

07:17.220 --> 07:20.190
and finish my breakfast without
thinking about your penis.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.220
Béchamel?
Uh, I'm done.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.160
One, two, three.
I already have...

07:33.200 --> 07:34.660
Mm?

07:34.700 --> 07:36.100
Okay.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.700
Let's do lemon drops next.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.000
Don't you have work?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.510
Have you
seen what I do?

07:43.540 --> 07:45.510
Now that you mention it,
I've never known.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.510
How does it work?
Like, with Sam. Who pays you?

07:48.550 --> 07:50.290
The company for which I work.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.560
A company hired you?

07:52.580 --> 07:56.080
They interviewed you
and then offered you a job?

07:59.390 --> 08:02.120
Ooh, let's try cosmos
next, like ladies.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.560
Cosmos.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.370
Why are you asking me questions?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.310
It's just funny.

08:07.330 --> 08:09.300
With this
insane revelation that,

08:09.330 --> 08:12.100
for some reason,
you don't wash your legs.

08:12.140 --> 08:13.650
No need.
Water falls on them.

08:13.670 --> 08:14.940
Oh, my god.

08:14.970 --> 08:17.210
Anyway, had you not
said anything,

08:17.240 --> 08:19.570
I might have never known
this fact.

08:19.610 --> 08:21.280
So? Chug.

08:21.310 --> 08:25.050
So? The unknowable
is terrifying, Gretchen.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.720
That's why humanity explores.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.550
To shine a light

08:29.590 --> 08:32.059
on the frightening dark
that surrounds us.

08:32.090 --> 08:35.720
Thus, immediately upon learning
that you don't wash your legs...

08:35.760 --> 08:37.630
Itself unimportant...

08:37.659 --> 08:42.059
I'm now thrust into wondering:
What else don't I know?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.770
About me? Ooh, okay.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.000
Um, I dated two of the baldwins.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.970
I competed in the U.S. teen
nationals for show jumping.

08:51.010 --> 08:52.910
In horsery?
Yes, horsery.

08:52.940 --> 08:53.840
For ten months,

08:53.880 --> 08:54.940
I did ink work

08:54.980 --> 08:55.940
for a professional
counterfeiter.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.010
I've never eaten a blueberry.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.080
They are doll eyes.
Think about it.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.120
Drink.

09:03.150 --> 09:05.420
How do I not know any of this?

09:06.620 --> 09:08.260
I can't do a cartwheel.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.930
An owl tried to kill
me at Bible camp.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.330
What?
Big sumbitch.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.200
Sluiced right through
the night air,

09:13.230 --> 09:15.600
silent as shit.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.180
I think there's still a scar
if you want...
No, no, no, no.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.500
What kind of camp did you say?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.550
Bible camp. See,
my real problem is

09:20.570 --> 09:22.710
I was wearing a headband with
a cute little mouse on it.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.370
Gretchen, are you religious?

09:24.410 --> 09:26.040
No!

09:26.080 --> 09:28.250
I consider myself
more generally spiritual.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.680
Drink.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.120
Whew! I am hammered!

09:36.150 --> 09:38.120
Are you hammered?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.870
You're the best.

09:39.890 --> 09:41.690
I'm so glad you're my boyfriend.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.370
Mm.
Look, I know we
weren't gonna say it,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.640
but... screw it.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.500
I love you, Jimmy.

09:48.530 --> 09:50.370
I love you.
I knew it.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.670
Psyche! Nice try, dummy.

09:51.700 --> 09:52.970
I've had five shots.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.540
I could fly a plane
after five shots. Bye.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.640
He doesn't remember saying it.
Little punk-ass bitch.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.410
I've done tons of stuff
drunk, and it all counts:

10:04.450 --> 10:07.320
My wedding, driving school,

10:07.350 --> 10:09.050
all my dentist appointments.

10:09.090 --> 10:12.500
Getting vag-fected by Paul's
wriggly little jizz monsters?

10:12.520 --> 10:14.160
Ow! No! Ow!

10:14.190 --> 10:15.890
Don't pinch me!
We are having this baby!

10:15.930 --> 10:17.540
It's a fresh start.
Stop!

10:17.560 --> 10:18.390
You bitch!
Quit it!

10:18.430 --> 10:20.400
Stop it!

10:20.430 --> 10:22.160
We're supposed to be
having a meeting

10:22.200 --> 10:24.500
about the secret
reunion show tonight.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.680
You're early.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.740
It's still my lunch hour.

10:28.970 --> 10:30.410
I will eat those later.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.640
You're not having this baby.

10:33.980 --> 10:37.580
Unfortunately, being keenly
in tune with the human condition

10:37.620 --> 10:39.390
means that after hearing
this idiotic shit

10:39.420 --> 10:40.860
for the past ten minutes,

10:40.890 --> 10:42.560
I have thoughts.
Bitch,

10:42.590 --> 10:43.960
he does not love you.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.090
Oh, goddamn it!

10:45.120 --> 10:46.090
Sam:
When you say

10:46.120 --> 10:47.560
"i love you,"

10:47.590 --> 10:50.730
it's supposed to be
romantic and/or highly

10:50.760 --> 10:52.060
sexual.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.470
Or when you're so overwhelmed

10:53.500 --> 10:54.910
by what perfection
is in front of you...

10:54.930 --> 10:57.300
If you say the word
"jaclyn" one more time,

10:57.340 --> 10:59.710
I will gag you with that
raggedy-ass bandanna!

10:59.740 --> 11:01.250
I've never loved anyone.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.450
I guess it's because I never
felt worthy of love in return.

11:03.470 --> 11:07.240
Be the ceo of your own life,
gretch.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.040
Don't wait for no one
to say it to you.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.910
Every morning in the mirror,
i purse my pillow lips up

11:11.950 --> 11:14.650
and stare into my apple juice
eyes, and I be like,

11:14.690 --> 11:16.390
"i love you.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.720
"I love you, Sam.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.730
I love you!"

11:21.760 --> 11:23.330
"Apple juice eyes"?

11:23.360 --> 11:25.490
Don't be trying to play
like they ain't rich,

11:25.530 --> 11:27.230
delicious, apple juice.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.470
That's why no one loves you.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.730
Anyway, dudes don't
say it with words,

11:32.770 --> 11:34.040
they say it with actions.

11:35.210 --> 11:36.950
Other bitch, get out of here.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.740
We got to talk about the show.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.440
I am all over it, Sam.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.110
I have a press release
ready to go.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.210
It's a secret show!

11:46.220 --> 11:47.290
No press release.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.820
No industry whispers.

11:48.850 --> 11:53.020
Um... then how will
people find out about it?

11:53.060 --> 11:56.760
Real ballers' fans find out
clandestine style and shit.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.190
Fetty wap at the El Rey.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.330
Schoolboy q on the roof
of the standard.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.770
Young thug at sufjan Steven's
broth restaurant.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.600
No press. All packed.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.710
Okay, but that's not
actually how it works.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.710
Gretch! No!

12:08.740 --> 12:10.770
It has to be pure.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.340
It's a point of pride.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.750
Prove to the world
we ain't never slipped.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.980
Hello?

12:18.980 --> 12:20.220
Hi.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.950
I was just
babysitting next door,

12:21.990 --> 12:25.630
and I got bored watching
hulu, like we millennials do.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.970
Oh, hi. Come in.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.690
Geez, nice place.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.800
Reminds me of my
piano teacher's house.

12:33.830 --> 12:36.300
Sometimes we sit too close
to each other on the bench,

12:36.330 --> 12:38.230
and our
side-butts touch.

12:38.270 --> 12:40.400
It's ac... it's actually
my friend Jimmy's house.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.050
He let me sleep here
because I was homeless...

12:42.070 --> 12:43.470
Dude, this is fantasy.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.870
Oh, right. Uh...

12:44.910 --> 12:46.310
Yeah, this is my house.

12:46.340 --> 12:49.040
Which I bought
with a mortgage... money loan.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.750
Yeah, well, I just moved
to town to be a YouTube star.

12:51.780 --> 12:54.580
Don't you love my widdle
baby voice, daddy?

12:54.620 --> 12:55.850
Whoa.

12:55.890 --> 12:57.460
Oh, shit. Sorry.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.230
Hey, troopmate.

13:01.260 --> 13:05.090
What happens in the foxhole
stays in the foxhole, right?

13:05.130 --> 13:07.860
Shit. Sorry. Ugh. I'm not very
good at this, which is weird,

13:07.900 --> 13:10.270
because my character work
is what got me very close

13:10.300 --> 13:13.200
on three different basic cable
hidden camera prank shows.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.100
Let's try again.

13:14.140 --> 13:16.100
No, no. It-it's okay.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.840
Is it me?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.750
Is this because

13:19.780 --> 13:21.390
I farted in front of you
the other day?

13:21.410 --> 13:25.210
Some of my new medications
apparently can have

13:25.250 --> 13:28.850
libido-interfering
characteristics.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.860
Well, can't you just
get them to switch them?

13:30.890 --> 13:32.520
They have been switching them

13:32.560 --> 13:34.900
and switching them and switching
them and switching them.

13:34.930 --> 13:37.140
Well, your body probably
just has to get used to it.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.730
I mean, they wouldn't have you
on something that makes you

13:39.760 --> 13:41.730
unable to have
sex forever.
Of course not.

13:41.770 --> 13:44.310
And, until you figure it out,
there's probably a pill

13:44.340 --> 13:45.950
you could take...
No, I'm not taking
another pill.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.140
I can't keep taking
more pills and more pills

13:48.170 --> 13:49.970
and more pills, okay?

13:50.010 --> 13:51.270
Never mind. I'm sorry.

13:51.310 --> 13:53.310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:54.950 --> 13:57.260
It's just hard.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.450
No, it's not.
Bad, Dorothy.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.160
This door list is as white
as your ass!

14:14.200 --> 14:16.760
Where's all the goddamn people
on this bitch, bitch?

14:16.800 --> 14:18.900
You told me not to publicize it!

14:18.940 --> 14:20.780
To normal people, stupid!

14:20.810 --> 14:22.590
Where's all the media dudes
and the influencers?

14:22.610 --> 14:24.920
Our actor and athlete fans?

14:24.940 --> 14:26.940
Where the hell is cp3
and Marcelo huertas

14:26.980 --> 14:29.840
and Bradley Cooper?
Bradley Cooper loves us!

14:29.880 --> 14:30.990
We got hella wasted with dude

14:31.020 --> 14:32.490
backstage of elephant man.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.490
You remember that?
Mm-hmm.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.820
Where is Bradley Cooper, gretch?

14:34.850 --> 14:36.450
Where is Bradley Cooper?!

14:36.490 --> 14:38.100
You forbade me
from inviting anyone!

14:38.120 --> 14:39.990
Not important people!

14:40.030 --> 14:42.770
I hate you! This is sabotage!

14:42.790 --> 14:46.160
Quick! Social media Tsunami!

14:50.700 --> 14:52.800
Yo. What's up, fans?

14:52.840 --> 14:55.680
It's your boy, Sam.
Come down to the smear, now.

14:55.710 --> 14:58.720
Secret show. Hella shrimps!

14:58.740 --> 15:00.040
I love you.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.180
It's no use.
We only got 20 minutes!

15:02.210 --> 15:04.510
I cannot have snaps
of an empty-ass show

15:04.550 --> 15:06.110
all over the Internet!

15:06.150 --> 15:08.650
Get bodies in here.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.460
I don't care how!

15:10.490 --> 15:11.720
Shit!

15:13.890 --> 15:16.190
And don't forget Bradley Cooper!

15:16.230 --> 15:19.170
* ooh, ooh...

15:19.200 --> 15:21.010
Lindsay.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.230
You look positively ethereal.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.740
I am so excited

15:28.770 --> 15:31.970
to open my special prize
and find out

15:32.010 --> 15:34.110
what we're doing
tonight. Hmm?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.030
"Red napkin"?

15:47.860 --> 15:49.490
Paul, this dress
doesn't have a butt.

15:49.530 --> 15:52.200
It's an apron.

15:52.230 --> 15:53.530
A napron?

15:53.560 --> 15:56.700
Red napkin is the finest
in seasonal, pre-portioned meals

15:56.730 --> 16:00.440
delivered fresh, thrice weekly,
that you cook at home together.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.500
My present is cooking?

16:02.540 --> 16:03.840
Cooking as a family.

16:03.870 --> 16:06.070
Family.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.840
You don't seem excited.
I thought you were

16:07.880 --> 16:10.080
taking me out,
like a fun party date.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.190
We can't party anymore.
You're pregnant.

16:13.220 --> 16:14.750
Like we talked about.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.760
This is the next phase
of our life.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.990
And we both want that.

17:34.130 --> 17:35.860
Oh.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.050
Gracias.
Gracias, mi hija.

18:33.790 --> 18:36.490
You speak Spanish?

18:36.530 --> 18:38.240
Who doesn't speak Spanish?

18:38.260 --> 18:40.400
Me. Edgar.

18:40.430 --> 18:43.160
Look, Jimmy,
if you're that freaked out,

18:43.200 --> 18:46.100
we can just unsay it, okay?
Poof! Unsaid.

18:46.140 --> 18:47.950
I'm not gonna start pretending.

18:47.970 --> 18:50.040
I might as well start pretending
there's a person

18:50.070 --> 18:52.910
who lives in the clouds who
cares whether we survive cancer

18:52.940 --> 18:54.180
or not.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.210
We are strangers, Gretchen.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.060
Bullshit.
We know each other.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.280
Well, not really.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.890
We live together,
we trust, blindly.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.190
But it's based on what?
It's actual madness,

19:05.220 --> 19:08.090
willingly living with a wild
animal but one with thumbs

19:08.130 --> 19:11.740
who can steal your money
and hurt you emotionally.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.730
So what changed? Why are you
suddenly so freaked out now?

19:17.230 --> 19:19.070
What? I don't like that.
Stop doing that!

19:19.100 --> 19:22.070
That's why you've been asking me
questions all day?

19:22.110 --> 19:23.250
You never cared enough

19:23.270 --> 19:24.710
to ask before.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.110
Sam was right.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.640
You are showing me,
not telling me.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.250
Listen, those words...

19:31.280 --> 19:33.150
They're like a-a
verbal contract.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.820
They're a promise.

19:34.850 --> 19:37.080
And I am not ready
to make that promise.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.420
If "i love you"
is like a promise,

19:40.460 --> 19:43.890
it's just a promise
to, like, try real hard.

19:43.930 --> 19:45.290
Doesn't mean you can't fail.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.760
It doesn't?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.170
Have you met me?
The only way I can stomach

19:49.200 --> 19:51.830
any of this is knowing
i can just bail at any time.

19:51.870 --> 19:53.670
We can just... bail?

19:53.700 --> 19:55.940
Yeah. I always have
one foot out the door.

19:55.970 --> 19:56.970
With everything.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.910
Especially with us.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.940
So you might
just suddenly bounce?

20:01.980 --> 20:03.280
Any minute.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.980
I love you.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.330
Jimmy.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.690
Come here.

20:16.060 --> 20:19.360
*

20:19.400 --> 20:20.370
Listen,

20:20.400 --> 20:23.430
I'm sorry for earlier.
I reacted badly.

20:23.470 --> 20:24.530
Nah, you didn't.

20:24.570 --> 20:26.630
Yes, I did. And I'm sorry.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.540
Thank you.

20:28.570 --> 20:29.640
'Cause, honestly,

20:29.670 --> 20:32.040
your health is all that matters.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.220
We can just, like, have
a nontraditional thing.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.110
What do you mean?

20:36.150 --> 20:38.120
We don't have to have
penetrative sex.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.350
You know, you can just
go down on me for hours,

20:40.390 --> 20:41.830
like earlier.

20:41.850 --> 20:44.220
Ha-ha. Or we can get
one of those sex toys

20:44.250 --> 20:45.320
that looks like a dolphin.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.160
Anyway,

20:47.190 --> 20:49.160
I am in this,
regardless of limitations

20:49.190 --> 20:50.660
or what we can't do anymore.
Okay?

20:57.230 --> 20:59.530
Thank you.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.300
I have to hit the restroom.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.340
Okay.

21:04.340 --> 21:06.740
*

21:35.370 --> 21:39.670
* I'm Steph curry rapping,
getting digit, loads of paper *

21:39.710 --> 21:42.780
* sippin' Martinis, snuffin',
huffin' giga-loads of vapor *

21:42.810 --> 21:44.910
* don draper * paper palace

21:44.950 --> 21:46.680
* your house is all papyrus

21:46.720 --> 21:49.730
* house of cards falling down,
round somebody killed osiris *

21:49.750 --> 21:51.520
* medicare, medicaid

21:51.560 --> 21:53.360

21:53.390 --> 21:55.070
* nervous kid,
I'll show your nervous grandma *

21:55.090 --> 21:56.520
* just what nervous is

21:56.560 --> 21:59.630
* shit-talking cops
like my name was Mel Gibson *

21:59.660 --> 22:02.800
* sugar tits, honey dip,
choosy bitches prefer Tiffany *

22:02.830 --> 22:06.800
* I'm so sky high
while my mind's eye is boozy *

22:06.840 --> 22:09.550
* I deserve to be blown
before the jacuzzi *

22:09.570 --> 22:13.580
* I deserve to be
blown before the jacuzzi *

22:13.610 --> 22:15.710
* I deserve to be blown
before the jacuzzi *

22:15.750 --> 22:19.820
* I deserve to be
blown before the jacuzzi. *

22:22.920 --> 22:25.290
Now, as y'all know,

22:25.320 --> 22:28.120
me and these fools were beefin'.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.960
But squabbles is normal
in a family.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.340
So during that time,
we wrote a song

22:34.360 --> 22:37.130
that really speaks to the soul
of friendship in this

22:37.170 --> 22:38.810
incendiary cultural time.

22:38.840 --> 22:43.150
It's called
"new phone, who dis?"

22:45.480 --> 22:48.420
Where's that simple-ass
white bitch at?!

22:48.450 --> 22:49.650
White bitch!

22:51.380 --> 22:53.580
Man:
Here's the classic sound

22:53.620 --> 22:55.750
of the red-winged blackbird.

22:55.790 --> 22:58.800
For our first meal,
dear wife, we are having

22:58.820 --> 23:01.690
hominy and
poblano pepper posole,

23:01.730 --> 23:04.300
with a warm mushroom salad
and rhubarb grits.

23:04.330 --> 23:05.630
Now, the chatters

23:05.660 --> 23:07.800
of a house wren.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.670
I picked up a Demi-bottle
of gewurztraminer.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.940
Obviously, you can't have any,
so I sodastreamed

23:13.970 --> 23:18.670
some sparkling water
with yuzu for you-zou.

23:18.710 --> 23:20.550
Eastern meadowlarks
came to nest in our yard...

23:20.580 --> 23:21.880
Paul:
Interesting fact:

23:21.910 --> 23:24.280
Did you know an
average ear of corn

23:24.310 --> 23:26.380
has an even number of rows,

23:26.420 --> 23:27.490
