WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.743
So you're saying that if
filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow

00:04.046 --> 00:05.787
married and divorced former
wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow,

00:06.089 --> 00:07.750
then married
Deuce Bigalow,

00:08.050 --> 00:10.712
she'd be known as Kathryn
Bigelow-Bigelow-Bigalow male gigolo?

00:11.011 --> 00:15.881
Yes. And if Kathryn and Bam
Bam had a one-night stand four-way

00:16.183 --> 00:18.265
with Andrew Ridgeley
and George Michael,

00:18.560 --> 00:22.394
then that would be a "wham bam,
thank you, wham," with Bam Bam

00:22.689 --> 00:24.805
and Kathryn Bigelow-
Bigelow-Bigelow- Bigalow male gigolo.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.269
(THUD)
BRAD: Right.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.309
But what I asked was,
"Who's hungry?”

00:28.612 --> 00:29.693
| could eat a sub. Oh,
yeah. | could always eat.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.820
Okay. I thought you idiots
were going to the Bulls game?

00:32.115 --> 00:34.903
We tried to scalp tickets, but
Dave's "instincts" kicked in.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.408
| won these
at a church raffle,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.535
SO you can just
have them for face value.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.911
He's a cop!
Deal's off, pig!

00:42.376 --> 00:45.585
| told you. Chicago P.D.
has a jump street unit. Ugh.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.620
(SIGHS DEEPLY) We
gotta watch the game here.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.039
Well, you're gonna have to take
it up with the little one over there.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.754
Consider your TV Liam Neeson's
daughter, "cause this bitch is taken.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.839
And your remote is also
Liam Neeson's daughter

00:55.138 --> 00:56.253
"cause this bitch
is taken, too.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.468
Why don't you just
watch TV at your place?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.098
We don't have
cable anymore.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.099
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
Deal's off, pig!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.260
(CLATTER)

01:03.605 --> 01:04.640
Well,
in fairness to Dave,

01:04.940 --> 01:06.430
he has been
overly suspicious

01:06.733 --> 01:07.939
ever since he accidentally
got on that bangbus.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.350
Everyone, quiet!

01:09.653 --> 01:11.360
Baby Justice is on.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.317
Oh! This is that show about
a sassy toddler named Justice

01:14.616 --> 01:17.233
who's also the honorary
sheriff of a small town in Ohio.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.527
The tagline is, "I'm gettin'
too old for this poop.”

01:19.830 --> 01:20.945
Talk to me.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.409
Where's my gun?

01:22.708 --> 01:24.073
Uh!
(EXPLOSION)

01:24.376 --> 01:27.243
Well, that crap is PBS compared
to the other stuff she watches,

01:27.546 --> 01:30.584
which is basically people just getting
hit in the sac for cash and prizes.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.668
(LAUGHS) It's funny 'cause
we're a nation in decline.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.709
Baby Justice isn't garbage.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.298
President Obama watches it.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.087
That was an SNL sketch.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.428
Look, guys,
| may not read the paper

01:41.727 --> 01:44.059
or know what an Ira Glass is,
but I have depth.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.187
| will have you know
that I am an avid journaler.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.314
Oh, I gotta get
my mitts on this.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.726
| have been waiting my whole
life for this moment. Thank you.

01:52.029 --> 01:55.567
What? This is just
a series of top ten lists.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.823
"Coolest smells.
Celebrity crushes.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.608
"Favorite time of day?"

01:59.911 --> 02:02.198
Oh.
"4-way tie for first."

02:02.497 --> 02:03.908
"Naptime"
is on there twice?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.618
Everyone needs
two naps per day.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.624
Honorable mention
for "beer o'clock."

02:07.919 --> 02:09.080
This is serious journalism.
(CHUCKLES)

02:20.182 --> 02:21.718
And that's where the term
"downbeat" comes from.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.098
Cool.
Oh.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.007
BRAD: Mmm-hmm.
Wow, I was way off.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.598
Oh, man.
Thumb-face Larry is here.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.764
Ugh! Oh, that guy is SO
annoying. (EXHALES DEEPLY)

02:30.067 --> 02:31.273
How many times am I
gonna have to hear the story

02:31.568 --> 02:33.275
about how he
test-drove a Volt?

02:33.570 --> 02:34.685
And I hate how he's always
trying to check the label on my shirt

02:34.988 --> 02:35.978
to see where it's from.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.771
Yeah,
plus he's bad in bed.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.156
I've heard.
BOTH: Ah.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.441
From people.
BOTH: Mmm.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.530
Who are me.
BOTH: Wait!

02:42.829 --> 02:44.570
You slept with
Thumb-face Larry?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.830
First of all,
| blame beer goggles.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.832
But he was the last
gay guy in the bar,

02:49.127 --> 02:50.709
so I do have to blame
queer goggles.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.244
And he did give me
a piece of his bagel,

02:52.547 --> 02:53.537
so I do have to also
blame schmear goggles.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.626
Mmm.

02:55.926 --> 02:56.836
Look, I've just been trying
to avoid him ever since.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.296
Oh, well, I think
he just spotted you.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.630
PENNY: Mmm. MAX:
(WHISPERS) Oh, man.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.671
Okay, act like we're in some
sort of in-depth conversation

03:01.973 --> 03:03.179
so that he doesn't feel the need
to come over here and interject.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.180
Of course. We got you, buddy.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.175
Traitors!

03:08.814 --> 03:10.396
Uh, uh...
Hey. Hey! Hey. Oh.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.022
Uh, sorry to do this,
but would you mind, uh,

03:12.317 --> 03:14.149
pretending to have a
fake conversation with me

03:14.444 --> 03:15.900
so that someone doesn't
come over here and talk to me?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.107
Okay. Uh, what should
we pretend to talk about?

03:18.407 --> 03:19.192
| don't know.
Our fake marriage?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.281
We're married?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.816
D... Uh, dating.
For how long?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.202
Three years.
We're not married yet?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.113
Can't we just have
one fake conversation

03:27.416 --> 03:28.121
without you talking about
marriage all the time?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.532
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:29.835 --> 03:31.166
Hey, Brad.
Hey, Penny.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.371
(INHALES LOUDLY)

03:32.671 --> 03:34.253
| love that shirt,
Brad.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.084
(SINGSONGY) Where's
it from? Come on.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.670
(INHALES SHARPLY) J... Hey!
Get your thumbs off me, Larry!

03:38.969 --> 03:39.925
God! Structure.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.385
So crisp.
Thanks.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.762
Then it's settled.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.547
Next Valentine's Day,

03:45.851 --> 03:47.683
we will meet at the top
of the Empire State Building,

03:47.978 --> 03:49.889
and when I don't show up,
you will jump. (CHUCKLES)

03:50.188 --> 03:51.849
Okay, this has got
to be the weirdest way

03:52.149 --> 03:53.810
a guy's ever tried
to hit on me,

03:54.109 --> 03:55.019
and honestly,
| don't hate it.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.854
Oh! (CHUCKLES) (GIGGLES)

03:57.154 --> 03:59.361
This happens a lot.
I'm not actually, um...

03:59.656 --> 04:02.569
Hey, listen. | get great seats
to tons of stuff through my job.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.450
Would you wanna go
to the Bulls game tomorrow?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.110
The Bulls game?
Yeah.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.120
With a beautiful woman?
Uh...

04:08.415 --> 04:09.655
I'd have to be gay
to say "no" to that.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.450
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

04:12.753 --> 04:13.709
Just to be clear,
| am not gay,

04:14.004 --> 04:14.493
and yes, I do wanna
go to the Bulls game.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.959
So...
This is definitely weird.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.795
Yeah, and I know I'm not
dreaming, 'cause if I were,

04:21.094 --> 04:22.630
everyone would be me.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.045
Oh, I'm sorry, guys. I'm finished
with the Metro section. Help yourself.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.759
Okay.
All right. I'll bite.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.178
Whatcha doin", Al?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.594
Well, I thought about what you
guys said, and you're right, okay?

04:31.897 --> 04:35.481
I've been polluting my mind with tabloid
magazines and entertaining television.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.108
So from now on, | am only
gonna read newspapers

04:38.403 --> 04:39.859
and watch TV shows where
white guys sit behind big desks.

04:40.155 --> 04:40.860
(WHISPERS)
That is it.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.317
Okay.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.856
(CHUCKLES)
Cool.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.570
Good luck with that.

04:45.869 --> 04:46.700
What? You don't
think | can do it?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.282
No.
We think you can do it.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.696
There's just no way
that you will. And also...

04:51.541 --> 04:52.531
You can't.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.450
Come on,
let's face it, Al.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.415
You lose focus more often than
that camera I told Jane not to buy.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.546
Eight years. It's been eight
years. | told you not to buy it.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.627
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.838
All right, Al,
remember that time

05:04.137 --> 05:06.879
that you tried to watch
the AFI Top 100 Comedies,

05:07.182 --> 05:09.423
and you gave up when Harold and
Maude didn't make it to White Castle?

05:09.726 --> 05:12.343
Or... Remember that time
when you almost married Dave?

05:12.646 --> 05:13.852
Yeah, remember that?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.979
This time it's different,
okay? I'm serious.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.810
I'm as serious as this mess
in Washington. Am I right?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.480
What? Am I not right? I'm
only halfway through the article.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.156
Check out how dope my
seats at the Bulls game were.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.112
That's
Carlos Boozer's knee.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.152
That's
Rip Hamilton's thigh.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.321
That's the security guard's
hand from when he took my phone

05:32.624 --> 05:34.035
because apparently upshort
pictures are not allowed

05:34.334 --> 05:36.166
at the United Center.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.452
Hmm. So this girl took
you to a Bulls game,

05:38.755 --> 05:40.587
you went for drinks after,
then you walked her home.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.963
Sounds like a date.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.250
Good. That's what
I'm going for.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.794
Wait. Did you get off the "D"
train and transfer to the "V" train

05:47.097 --> 05:48.337
at Grand Sexual station?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.007
Guys, come on.
(SCOFFS)

05:51.309 --> 05:54.392
Gay. Straight.
Human sexuality is a...

05:54.688 --> 05:55.928
...ils a rich mosaic
with vivid...

05:56.231 --> 05:57.642
So you're using her
for Bulls tickets?

05:57.941 --> 06:00.558
Some would say
that she's using me.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.317
Of course
those people would be wrong,

06:02.612 --> 06:03.898
and the more accurate
description is that I'm using her.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.188
Max!
I'm doing her a favor.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.027
Who would you rather her date,

06:08.326 --> 06:12.411
some 24-year-old jager hound
who's only using her for her body?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.368
| would rather her date some
sophisticated, older gay man.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.157
And who might that be now?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.201
Really? Okay, as someone
who's dated enough gay guys

06:19.504 --> 06:21.586
to earn the nickname
"Will She Ever Learn?",

06:21.882 --> 06:23.543
| cannot allow you to
keep wasting this girl's time.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.753
Wasting her time?
(SCOFFS)

06:26.052 --> 06:27.383
She'll figure it out.
She's young. She's hot.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.590
That makes it worse, Max!

06:29.890 --> 06:32.632
There are a limited number
of hot chicks out there.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.301
And on behalf of the 24-year-old
jager hounds who don't have a voice,

06:35.604 --> 06:36.218
| also object.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.601
How dare you, sirs...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.938
(GROANS) Telling me
who I can and can't love?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.853
| am just glad

06:46.156 --> 06:48.773
that the gay guy that
Sean Penn played in Milk

06:49.075 --> 06:50.361
is not around to hear this.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.570
You mean Harvey Milk?

06:53.914 --> 06:54.904
(WHISPERS)
| saw Yes Man instead.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.415
Oh.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.499
Look at that little girl
reading that great big book!

07:02.797 --> 07:05.915
"The Global Financial Crisis:
A Macroeconomic Perspective."

07:06.217 --> 07:08.083
Jumping right into
the deep end, no floaties.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.547
I'll be honest,
it's tough.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.211
I'm having a hard time
following some of it.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.927
Well, if you're lookin'
for the 411 on the GFC,

07:15.226 --> 07:17.263
look no further than
the University of Dave Rose,

07:17.562 --> 07:19.018
Champaign-Urbana.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.180
Here's what
you need to know.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.191
The economy is like this
great, big unpoppable bubble.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.478
Wait. I don't think that lines up with
what I just learned about the economy...

07:27.781 --> 07:28.646
Or what I've always
known about bubbles.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.031
Yes,
it is a complicated matter.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.737
Okay, you see,
you have Fannie and Freddie.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.368
They might be brother
and sister. Let me back up.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.621
At the end
of "Trading Places,"

07:37.916 --> 07:39.247
they're selling frozen
orange juice futures. That...

07:39.542 --> 07:40.623
You know what?
Let me back up again.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.035
Eddie Murphy
was fresh off 48 hrs.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.248
Okay, let me
stop you right there.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.457
I'm sorry. Am I moving
too quickly for you?

07:46.466 --> 07:47.672
Dave...

07:47.968 --> 07:49.379
No offense,

07:49.678 --> 07:51.794
but it just seems like you're bundling
a bunch of your worthless ideas

07:52.097 --> 07:53.587
and trying to pass them off
the same way the banks did

07:53.890 --> 07:56.131
with mortgage-backed
securities.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.549
Hmm. | guess some
of this is sinking in.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.352
(WHISPERS) Dear God,
what did that mean?

08:05.860 --> 08:07.897
Ugh.
Another text from Max.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.278
It's a picture of him
and Katie at the game.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.905
Wait. They have seats
next to John Cusack's mom?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.783
<i>No, that's John Cusack. On.</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:16.660
(SCOFFS) | cannot believe
Max is getting away with this.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.071
It is so unfair
to that girl.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.615
And it's unfair to whoever has
that seat behind his giant head.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.033
We have to tell
Katie he's gay.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.122
Oh, that seems mean.
(SCOFFS)

08:25.422 --> 08:27.709
Okay, well, then let's use the
gay stuff Max does to create a trap

08:28.008 --> 08:29.715
and force him to
out himself. All right.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.297
What are the gay things
Max does?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.756
Okay. Hmm.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.138
Oh! Doesn't he spend hundreds
of dollars on lotions and creams?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.799
No, that's me.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.433
(GASPS) Ooh! What about
that binder he has full of pictures

08:40.729 --> 08:41.890
of men's goatees?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.678
That's Dave.
Mmm-hmm.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.689
But he does have that
giant collection of gay porno.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.440
Weirdly, that's Alex. Oh.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.101
And every time | ask
her why, she just says...

08:49.404 --> 08:51.190
(IN DEEP VOICE) "Hey, I
don't smoke but I have ashtrays.”

08:51.489 --> 08:53.480
You know, I'm starting to think
Max is the least gay of all of us.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.740
What a fresh character.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.448
Except for the one
really gay thing he does.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.367
Sex with men?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.122
That's exactly what
| was referring to!

09:03.418 --> 09:04.624
Oh!
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:04.919 --> 09:06.455
| wish there was a way
we could use that.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.795
Hey, Max! You remember
Thumb-face Larry.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.299
| mean, Regular Larry.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.336
Hey, Max.
| love that shirt.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.094
(SINGSONGY)
Where is it from?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.596
Oh, come on! Oh! (GROANS)
All right, enough of that.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.929
Okay. Okay. So...

09:21.227 --> 09:23.264
Thanks for stopping by, but
you guys gotta get going now.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.554
Max! Are these
your friends? Uh...

09:25.857 --> 09:27.814
| think it's safe to call these
two "more than friends."

09:28.109 --> 09:29.565
Am I right, Lar?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.898
Well, we did spend a
magnificent night together.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.028
Yes, coming up
with business ideas.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.859
Business ideas?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.614
I... I thought
we had something special.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.446
So did |, but the
market didn't like it.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.156
And the market...
She's a fickle lady.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.071
We made love in
your shower. (GASPS)

09:42.373 --> 09:44.785
Is the title of the track
that we produced together,

09:45.085 --> 09:45.950
which we thought would go
straight to the top of the charts.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.617
Oh,
| remember that track.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.332
Just sounded like a
couple of dudes having sex.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.120
Everybody's a critic,
ain't they? Huh?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.419
Oh, hey!
Larry, look!

09:53.718 --> 09:55.379
That guy's wearing
two different shirts!

09:55.678 --> 09:56.793
| wish there was a way
that we could find out

09:57.097 --> 09:57.962
where each one
of them was from.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.846
| have a way.
Yeah?

10:00.141 --> 10:00.801
(CLENCHED TEETH)
You got some nerve on you.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.140
(LAUGHS)

10:03.436 --> 10:05.268
Well, that was
weird. Weird alert.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.396
Yeah. I didn't know
Max had a business partner.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.227
(WHISPERS)
She still doesn't know.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.894
| wonder if I should invite Larry
to the Bulls game tomorrow?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.403
| have a third ticket.
It's right behind the bench.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.030
Aw, Katie, the thing is,
Max is...

10:18.326 --> 10:20.317
Really insistent on not
mixing business with pleasure.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.236
But I'll go to the game
with you guys. Great!

10:22.539 --> 10:23.404
(LAUGHS) (LOWERED
VOICE) What are you doing?

10:23.706 --> 10:24.821
What about the truth?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.331
(WHISPERS)
Oh. Right.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.457
Um, Max and Penny used to
date, and she's still in love with him,

10:31.756 --> 10:34.043
so any, like,
wild claims she makes

10:34.342 --> 10:36.458
should instantly be dismissed as
the ravings of a jealous mad woman.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.297
PENNY: No. See, okay... Awkward.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.427
No, it's not awkward,
actually, because it's not true.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.133
But, see, Max is gay. Oh.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.968
Sad, sad Penny.
PENNY: But he is.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.383
I'm sorry. No, don't
you feel sorry for me.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.596
| feel sorry for you!

10:45.895 --> 10:47.101
Aw,
now she's projecting.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.853
I've been there.
What? I'm engaged.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.105
| don't care. How come
I've never met him?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.765
Okay.
Now...

10:52.068 --> 10:53.524
Should we eat at the game
or go for steaks after?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.106
| vote both.
Both, yeah.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.110
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

10:56.865 --> 10:57.775
(GASPS)

11:00.034 --> 11:01.650
Go, Bulls!
(LAUGHS)

11:01.953 --> 11:04.866
You don't understand.
Alex has gotten way smarter.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.372
(WHISPERS) It's possible
she's even smarter than me.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.455
Until last week, you thought people
in the army wore "camel-flage."

11:10.753 --> 11:11.914
Makes sense. Camels
are good at blending in.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.875
Anyway,
she's out of control.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.462
| can't say or do anything
without her correcting me.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.751
| can't live like this. We gotta
get her back on the sauce.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.546
All the old shows. I'm
talking fatsos in small spaces,

11:22.849 --> 11:24.886
real housewives
in various locations,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.641
idiots giving roses
to other idiots.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.301
| actually think
it's gonna be nice

11:28.605 --> 11:29.686
to have a little intellectual
discourse with my sister.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.972
Okay, fine.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.515
If you won't help me
make her dumber,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.274
then I'm gonna help me
make me smarter.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.106
So if you'll excuse me, | have
some library books to read.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.525
Your truck's on fire.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.531
Why did I put the
books next to the grill?

11:41.826 --> 11:42.861
Why did I put the books
next to the grill?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.651
Oh, God!

11:44.954 --> 11:47.161
Oh, dear God! Oh,
God! (LOUD BANGING)

11:47.457 --> 11:49.118
| cannot wait to hear about
all the new stuff you're learning.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.452
But let's order first.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.457
I'm thinking
about the ribs.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.243
Oof! Ribs for lunch.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.378
No, too heavy.
I'm gonna have the salmon.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.289
You get the beet salad,
and we'll share.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.458
You can pick the dressing
as long as it's on the side

11:59.761 --> 12:01.297
and in the vinaigrette family.
I'll pick the dressing.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.052
Classic controlling Jane.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.885
No, I'm not controlling.
I'm just aggressively helpful.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.720
Jane, it's okay. And
obsessive need to control

12:08.019 --> 12:10.135
is actually quite common
in older siblings.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.553
I'm reading all about it in a
fascinating book on birth order.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.643
That is a...

12:13.942 --> 12:15.103
Interesting theory.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.187
Yeah.
It's an unconscious attempt

12:17.487 --> 12:19.273
to regain the status you
felt you lost when I was born.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.983
It's why you dye your hair, it's
why you hate wearing long pants,

12:21.282 --> 12:22.693
and it's why...

12:22.992 --> 12:24.153
Well, don't even
get me started

12:24.452 --> 12:26.068
on the whole
interracial marriage thing.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.579
That is mom-sense.
Mmm?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.957
| mean, nonsense.
| mean, I... I don't...

12:33.253 --> 12:36.541
But... (IN SHAKY VOICE) ...the new baby
doesn't have to wear the big girl pants.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.329
| know. Are you
all set to order?

12:38.633 --> 12:39.964
Yes. I'm gonna have the ribs,
and she'll also have the ribs.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.421
That way, we can share.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.254
We're gonna share ribs.
Thank you.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.630
So you are throwing
a party for smart people.

12:46.933 --> 12:47.889
Actually...
(CHUCKLES)

12:48.184 --> 12:50.095
A 'salon' is a type
of gathering

12:50.395 --> 12:52.227
popularized
in 18th century France,

12:52.522 --> 12:53.853
where writers, artists,
and intellectuals would meet

12:54.148 --> 12:55.764
to refine their tastes
through conversation.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.025
Oh, sounds fun. | wish
I could, but I have stuff.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.527
Tonight is gonna be a veritable
who's who of people who respond

13:01.823 --> 13:03.985
to fliers they see on community
college bulletin boards.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.242
Well, you seem to have
the hot hand intellectually.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.198
What should I do
about my Max situation?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.783
Sorry, Penny.
| can't help you.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.743
But I do know
someone who can...

13:13.042 --> 13:14.999
Sun Tzu. Dave's friend who
always tries to sell me yarn?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.706
Oh, Penny.

13:17.005 --> 13:17.790
Classic Alex.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.204
What?

13:19.507 --> 13:21.293
Sun Tzu.
"The art of war."

13:21.592 --> 13:23.174
Turn your weakness
into your strength.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.210
As Max's crazy ex,

13:25.513 --> 13:27.675
you have intimate knowledge of
the one thing he does not want to do.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.305
Exercise? Bathe?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.556
Kill spiders?
Hold farts in?

13:30.852 --> 13:32.013
Not eat sugar
directly out of the bag?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.598
Have sex with a woman?
Touch corduroy?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.512
<i>Oh, it's touch corduroy!
Dee!</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:38.147
No! It was "have sex
with a woman." Damn it!

13:38.443 --> 13:41.060
Use your knowledge of Max's
repulsion to lady parts against him.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.693
(WHISPERS)
Wow.

13:42.989 --> 13:43.979
You and your
Chinese buddy are good.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.946
Hey, All
Look what we got.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.734
(CLOSES DOOR) Wait. Is it
"have got" or "have gotten"?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.995
Damn it. I've forgotten
how to use grammar.

13:52.290 --> 13:52.904
(LOWERED VOICE) All right,
keep it together. She can smell fear.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.202
DVDs.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.617
We have
Wipeout, Jackass,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.410
and a Japanese game show

13:59.714 --> 14:00.920
where you carry
your best friend's cat

14:01.215 --> 14:02.330
through a room
full of dogs.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.295
(LAUGHS)
Sounds so fun.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.586
While we're here, I'm gonna
have you take a quick whiff

14:07.889 --> 14:09.254
of this modeling glue,
see if it's gone bad.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.173
All this seems strange.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.387
Not really. They're just
intimidated by my growing intellect,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.723
and they want
the old Alex back.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.763
Listen, clowns,
| got news for you.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.977
| like the way I am now, and I'm
not gonna change, so deal with it.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.812
(SNIFFS)

14:26.115 --> 14:27.446
(SNIFFS) Oh. This
glue smells fine to me.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.525
Mmm. Trees.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.528
(CLATTERING)
Oh, God.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.741
All righty. Okey-dokey. (THUD)

14:38.920 --> 14:40.911
So I heard Katie's
taking you and Max

14:41.214 --> 14:42.921
to the Jay-Z concert on
Saturday night. That sounds fun.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.706
Yep. It's his last
retirement tour...

14:45.009 --> 14:46.420
Before his next
last retirement tour.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.925
Wait.
How do you know that?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.757
Oh, Katie told me...
When I invited her here.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.342
When you what now?

14:51.641 --> 14:53.223
Hey, guys!
PENNY: Hi there!

14:53.518 --> 14:54.383
There's my little sweetie.
(CHUCKLES)

14:54.685 --> 14:56.141
Hey.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.599
Penny,
what are you doing?

14:58.898 --> 14:59.933
You're not gonna
embarrass yourself again

15:00.233 --> 15:02.099
by making a bunch of
jealous accusations, are you?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.484
Actually, I invited
Katie here to apologize.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.567
You were right, Brad. | do
have unresolved feelings for Max,

15:07.865 --> 15:09.071
and that's why
| was talking so cray.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.573
Okay. Uh...

15:10.868 --> 15:12.358
They're not
feelings up here...

15:12.662 --> 15:13.777
Or here.
More like...

15:14.080 --> 15:14.990
(CLENCHED TEETH)
Down here.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.825
Oh.
Real talk...

15:17.125 --> 15:19.913
Max gave me the most world
view-shattering sex of my life.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.542
Eh-squeeze?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.920
Katie knows what I'm
talking about. Am I right, girl?

15:24.215 --> 15:25.831
Actually,
we've been taking it slow.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.124
Well, that explains why
you still have your voice.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.134
You haven't lost it yet
from screaming.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.262
Ugh. Tell you the truth,
we haven't even kissed yet.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.922
But we have done something
Max calls "forekissing."

15:35.017 --> 15:36.132
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

15:40.064 --> 15:40.929

Oh. Oh.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.704
Oh.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.161
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

16:00.460 --> 16:01.120
You were amazing.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.204
Oh, sure. That move.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.338
He calls that back later.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.873
And when he does, be prepared to
purchase a whole new bedroom set.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.133
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
All of it?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.339
Oh. Well...
| do like sex,

16:12.638 --> 16:13.799
and I hate my current
bedroom furniture.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.384
Then make a move, girl!

16:15.683 --> 16:16.969
Do not wait.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.850
Or a-keep a-waiting.
(CHUCKLES)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.056
At least until
after the Jay-Z concert,

16:21.355 --> 16:23.471
'cause you're gonna wanna have
full range of motion, pelvicly speaking.

16:23.774 --> 16:27.312
Uh, I think I'm gonna opt for the
world view-shattering sex instead.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.693
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, girl!

16:28.988 --> 16:29.944
Hey, now!
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:30.239 --> 16:30.899
Ah.
Oh! Mmm.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.991
Max, it's an emergency! Open up!

16:37.747 --> 16:38.828
Hey, Brad.
Ugh. Larry?

16:40.917 --> 16:41.998
Really?
What?

16:42.293 --> 16:43.328
| needed to blow off
some steam.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.244
I've been
forekissing all week.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.456
Besides, he doesn't look
that much like a thumb.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.921
| look like a thumb?

16:49.217 --> 16:51.128
Whoops.
Not now, Larry.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.213
A little. Listen, man,
we have a situation.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.298
Your girlfriend's gonna
try and have sex with you.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.713
Ah! Well, I fold.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.848
Too rich for my blood.
Hey, hey! No, no, no!

16:59.143 --> 17:00.053
Come on, man,
you can't quit now!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.139
The Jay-Z concert's
in three days!

17:02.438 --> 17:04.805
You're right. You're
right. | can do this.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.563
Yes! It's just sex with a woman.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.723
(LAUGHS) Right? Straight
guys do it all the time.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.563
| did it this morning.
(LAUGHS)

17:09.862 --> 17:10.693
And I can do anything
| set this mind to.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.354
Lady butt.
Gross!

17:13.657 --> 17:15.365
Why are they
so weird and hairless?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.194
All right,
we have work to do.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.074
Um...

17:18.037 --> 17:19.027
Va...
Testicles.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.161
Al right.
(SIGHS)

17:22.375 --> 17:23.580
Fallopian...
Dudes.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.749
(SIGHS)

17:26.045 --> 17:27.955
Which is why I think
our understanding

17:28.256 --> 17:30.042
of the subconscious will
evolve the more we learn

17:30.341 --> 17:32.628
about the cognitive structures
of the brain. Very true.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.634
You know,
| was reading about Freud,

17:34.929 --> 17:36.920
and his theory on the
subconscious was fascinating.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.677
Freud?
(CHUCKLES)

17:39.976 --> 17:42.263
Excuse me, 1897 wired.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.973
They'd like their
antiquated notions back.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.310
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(MUTTERS)

17:47.608 --> 17:48.769
Well, they can't have 'em.
You know what I mean?

17:50.611 --> 17:51.521
No, I don't.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.156
Anyway, the prefrontal
cortex houses broca's area,

17:56.450 --> 17:57.440
so we get
to choose our...

17:57.743 --> 17:58.858
This is really romantic.

17:59.161 --> 17:59.821
So romantic.
(GIGGLES)

18:01.956 --> 18:03.037
You know what else
is romantic? What?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.619
DVDs.
Ooh.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.534
| got Schindler's List. We
could watch that. Okay.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.077
| got a documentary
on female circumcision,

18:10.631 --> 18:12.668
and I got a home movie
that I made

18:12.967 --> 18:14.503
that's just a bunch of scenes
of old men buying fruit. So...

18:15.886 --> 18:17.718
We're in for
a pretty steamy night.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.676
Mmm. Speaking of
steamy, | feel like it's...

18:20.975 --> 18:22.682
It's hot in here, right?
It's kind of... Yeah?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.308
Yeah. Usually, this apartment...

18:24.604 --> 18:26.971
A little hot, I feel. |
feel like it. ...is drafty.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.809
Oh, you brought
those. There are these.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.564
You know
what else is sexy?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.225
This compression sleeve.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.393
Mmm? What do you
say we just strap this

18:33.696 --> 18:34.982
over your yabbos?

18:35.281 --> 18:36.442
Flatten those
perky things out?

18:36.741 --> 18:37.276
What?
What?

18:38.367 --> 18:39.653
Forget that.
Oh.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.192
Let's take it back to one. Okay.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.491
(INHALES DEEPLY)

18:43.789 --> 18:44.745
Okay, here I come.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.456
(GAGS, SWALLOWS)

18:51.756 --> 18:53.087
I'm sorry. I'm : gay. (SIGHS)

18:53.382 --> 18:53.962
Of course you are.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.332
| had a feeling.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.752
Why have you been
going out with me then?

18:59.055 --> 19:01.137
At first, it was just 'cause of
your sweet-ass Bulls tickets. But...

19:01.432 --> 19:03.719
But then, Katie,
| got to know you,

19:04.018 --> 19:06.055
and it was still just about
your sweet-ass Bulls tickets.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.640
(SCOFFS)
(SLAPS LEG)

19:07.938 --> 19:09.349
It's true what they say.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.014
All the good ones
are either taken or gay.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.604
Um, okay,
you're not a good one.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.644
You're a liar, and you
have my mom's body.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.436
So good-bye, Max.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.230
Are we still going
to the Jay-Z concert?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.945
If we are, don't say
anything! Just slam the door!

19:22.244 --> 19:23.154
(SLAMS)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

19:25.456 --> 19:26.662
| hate myself sometimes.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.828
(SIGHS)

19:30.127 --> 19:31.083
Hey, Larry.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.336
Hey, Al.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.545
We've been
looking for you.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.709
Why aren't you out
at your party?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.343
(SIGHS)
You guys were right.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.504
The smart world
is not for me.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.218
No, we were wrong.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.007
We think it's great that
you're bettering yourself,

19:46.310 --> 19:47.391
and we should've
been more supportive.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.893
Yeah, we kinda suck.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.599
But those people...
| mean,

19:50.898 --> 19:52.889
you mix up "the |d
and the Ego” one time,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.933
and they are all over you.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.898
Well, in your defense, those
are two similar-looking fish.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.028
Oh. That's not right, is it?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.654
Okay

20:00.950 --> 20:03.112
It's too bad, 'cause I enjoyed
knowing stuff about things.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.743
But on the bright side, |
get to catch up on my shows.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.996
| wonder if Baby Justice ever
brought down that dogfighting ring.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.907
You know, you don't have to
choose one world or the other.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.668
Yeah. You can be smart
and still watch crap.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.295
| mean, just do what everyone
else does and like it ironically,

20:16.590 --> 20:18.957
when really there's no difference
between that and actually liking it.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.750
You had me
at "watch crap,"

20:21.053 --> 20:21.758
then you lost me
at "ironically,"

20:22.054 --> 20:23.636
then I just got hungry.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.137
She's back. She's back! Oh.
Oh! (LAUGHS) She's back!

20:27.184 --> 20:27.798
So what do you say? You
wanna get back to your party?

20:29.812 --> 20:30.973
| got a better idea.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.683
Get out, nerds!

20:34.692 --> 20:35.557
Go! (SCREAMING)

20:35.860 --> 20:36.816
Oh!

20:37.111 --> 20:37.600
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

20:39.321 --> 20:41.062
He got it in the nads!
(LAUGHS)

20:42.825 --> 20:43.735
Right in the nuts.
Bye.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.822
Maxy, did you learn
your lesson? Oh, yeah.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.866
Next time I pretend to be
straight for free Bulls tickets,

20:53.169 --> 20:55.706
| gotta tell 'em right off
the bat I can't have sex

20:56.005 --> 20:57.746
because my penis has
been cursed by a witch.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.459
Yeah, super believable.
Do not try and top that. Hmm.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.965
| won't.
"Cause you can't.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.001
Hey, guys. Katie. What
are you doing here?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.261
I'm taking you
to the Jay-Z concert.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.887
Awesome. Really?
No, fat ass.

21:07.183 --> 21:07.718
I'm bringing Penny!
Aw!

21:08.017 --> 21:09.098
(BOTH GROAN)

21:09.393 --> 21:10.758
She called
you a fat ass.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.643
You see, we bonded over
all the gay guys we've dated.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.724
But those days
are behind us.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.139
In fact, I'm seeing
this new guy,

21:16.442 --> 21:17.557
and he's coming
to the concert tonight.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.396
Ooh!
You gotta meet him.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.901
Congratulations. That's
really... KATIE: Derrick.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.107
You stud.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.360
