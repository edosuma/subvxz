06:51.536 --> 06:53.496
Are you getting the peas out?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.664
Are you getting them out, Jesper?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.040
We're ready to plate now,
and there are no peas in place.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.468
Looks very wet, eh?

14:04.551 --> 14:05.719
I will... fix it.

14:05.802 --> 14:06.929
Have you vacked?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.348
Like never vac meat.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.850
We talked about that earlier, haven't we?

14:11.934 --> 14:13.477
Peter?

14:13.560 --> 14:15.021
Do you have one that's un-vacked?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.813
No.

14:19.816 --> 14:22.611
It should be there, you know, on the grid.
Right?

14:22.694 --> 14:24.613
Yes.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.418
It's fun to see these pictures.
Time passes so fast!

14:37.501 --> 14:39.128
Sure does.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.506
These are a perfect snapshot of that time.

14:42.589 --> 14:44.216
We're eating the "julbord" buffet.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.802
The classic 1980's
Swedish Christmas feast.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.345
Yes.

15:54.745 --> 16:01.502
We sat here, and Magnus came to ask
if he could go to cooking school in Ã…re.

16:01.585 --> 16:06.882
We told him, "There's a perfectly
good cooking school right here!"

16:06.966 --> 16:11.095
Then he said,
"But this school is the best one.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.348
And that is that!"

16:14.431 --> 16:17.309
So...

30:22.237 --> 30:25.156
I'd like this to be done a little better
from now on, Jesper.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.034
You can't leave a mess
on your baking sheet.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.286
Or anything else.

30:30.370 --> 30:34.665
Because it's you who's doing the most work
and setting the example.

30:34.749 --> 30:38.920
It's hard to tell the others to improve
if you don't set a good example.
