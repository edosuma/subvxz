25:50.616 --> 25:53.884
Now you sit here.

25:59.357 --> 26:02.760
Clearly, it's all bullshit, but
how do we get him to admit it?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.962
These are seven motions
filed by mr. Reyes

26:04.964 --> 26:06.697
In regards
to his rape case.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.633
Here's one challenging the
validity of a witness I.D.,

26:09.635 --> 26:12.102
Another one requesting
an evidentiary hearing.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.704
They're all well-written

26:13.706 --> 26:16.206
With boiler-plate legal language
mixed in throughout,

26:16.208 --> 26:18.876
And yet this guy
can barely speak english.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.378
Mm. If only we knew
of a brilliant lawyer

26:21.380 --> 26:24.415
With compromised ethics
currently in county lockup.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.284
It's got to be stroh
writing these motions for him.

26:27.286 --> 26:30.621
And in return, reyes acts
as a conduit for information.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.222
Mm-hmm.
Stroh gives him
a message,

26:32.224 --> 26:33.791

to the convict,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.826
The convict gives it
to our letter writer.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.995
And the dirtbag casserole
is complete.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.130
Yeah, but how
do we prove it?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.833

You can download it for free
on the internet.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.104

what it is,

26:47.106 --> 26:49.440

that this is the short version.

26:49.442 --> 26:50.975
[ chuckling ] oh, boy.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.310
Basically,
the program compares texts.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.680
It ranks words by their usage,
particularly articles like "the"

26:56.682 --> 26:59.283
And prepositions
like "of" and "to" --

26:59.285 --> 27:01.652
Words that might seem
inconsequential

27:01.654 --> 27:04.622
But, in fact, leave an authorial
fingerprint on most any work.

27:04.624 --> 27:08.592
So, by taking a sampling of
legal motions written by stroh

27:08.594 --> 27:11.328
And comparing them to motions
authored by reyes...

27:11.330 --> 27:12.663
You can prove
stroh wrote them.

What?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.456
Everything's under control.
We have a safe room.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.158
But you need to come with me
for the time being.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.293
But what about sharon?
She's still upstairs.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.662
We're handling her right now.
She knows where you are.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.063
This is almost over.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.932
Okay, hold on.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.904
Okay.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.550
Does someone live here?

36:26.552 --> 36:29.719
Have a seat on the couch.
I need to radio our location.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.560
[ horn honks, tires screech ]

36:42.867 --> 36:46.236
[ guns cocking ]

36:48.372 --> 36:50.106
What's with the plastic?

36:50.108 --> 36:52.943
Is it to, like, keep stuff
off the couch or something?

36:54.979 --> 36:57.781
No, no.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.584
The plastic...

37:00.586 --> 37:03.420
Is to minimize
my contact with blood.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.088
Your what?
[ fire alarm blaring ]

37:06.891 --> 37:09.125
Sharon: L.A.P.D.!

37:09.127 --> 37:11.228
Help! Help! Help!

37:12.597 --> 37:14.431
Sharon! Sharon, he's in there!
Sharon, he went in there!

37:16.267 --> 37:18.435
[ gunshots ]

37:33.884 --> 37:35.285
Get him away
from the window!

37:35.287 --> 37:37.420
I see him!

37:38.456 --> 37:40.423
Cooper:
The suspect is in the open.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.058
He is on foot,
heading east.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.262
We need a perimeter now. And
get additional units rolling.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.908
Cand we got a three-block
of operimeter set upre.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.343
Around the building,
but it doesn't look promising.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.678
He could have slipped through
early on.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.513
Are we any closer
to I.D.'ing him?

38:03.515 --> 38:05.348
S.I.D. Is processing
every inch of that condo

38:05.350 --> 38:07.017
For prints and dna.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.252
Now, we know he played chess
with the kid yesterday,

38:09.254 --> 38:11.955
But he was disguised,
and he kept his head down a lot.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.991
Rusty was too freaked out
to really remember what
the guy looked like.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.494
We're sorting through all the
photos and film from the park

38:17.496 --> 38:19.296
To see if we have
a good shot of his face.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.930
But this dirtbag knew
we were out there.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.033
I mean, he clearly knew.
How did he get to rusty?

38:27.338 --> 38:29.506
The killer was using
his last victim's car

38:29.508 --> 38:31.441
To get access to the garage
and the poor guy's apartment.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.476
My fault.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.147
Rusty didn't stick
to the plan, chief.

38:37.149 --> 38:39.382
He talked to the guy
about his security

38:39.384 --> 38:40.684
And didn't tell us
he'd done it.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.720
This shouldn't
have happened.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.456
Sharon: Okay,
just so we're clear,

38:46.458 --> 38:49.693
Rusty's involvement
with this operation is over.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.227
Taylor:
Of course it is.

38:51.229 --> 38:54.230
Our only goal right now
is finding this creep.

38:54.232 --> 38:57.400
As for how all this affects
the case against phillip stroh,

38:57.402 --> 38:59.302
We have a plan.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.570
Captain...

39:00.572 --> 39:03.406
I suggest you alert rusty

39:03.408 --> 39:05.742
To the changes
we've discussed

39:05.744 --> 39:08.712
And implement those changes
tonight.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.880
Yes, sir.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.670
Hey.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.672
Hey.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.907
Hey. Are you okay?

39:37.909 --> 39:40.110
Just a little shaky.
Mm.

39:40.112 --> 39:42.879
But, um, never happier

39:42.881 --> 39:44.914
To have so many police officers
around me.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.116
Hmm.

39:46.118 --> 39:48.752
Rusty,
I owe you an apology.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.687
I went against
my instincts.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.589
No, no, I-I really,
really messed up.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.858
I never should have gone along
with this entire operation.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.359
I know I did. Sharon,
let -- let me finish, please.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.262
I thought I-I had a handle
on all this stuff,

39:59.264 --> 40:01.264
But I-I didn't follow
my orders,

40:01.266 --> 40:03.099
And I almost
got myself killed,

40:03.101 --> 40:05.468
And -- and from now on,
whatever you want me to do,

40:05.470 --> 40:07.137
Whatever it is
that I need to do,

40:07.139 --> 40:08.972
Sharon, I promise you
that I'll do it.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.608
I'll just do it,
because...

40:23.053 --> 40:26.990
You saved me...Again.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.794
[ sniffles ]

40:30.796 --> 40:32.762
But it's not over yet.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.834
Unfortunately, the guy who tried
to kill you is still out there.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.170
I know.

40:40.172 --> 40:43.173
And I am happy that you promised
to do what I say

40:43.175 --> 40:46.943
And that you know
it's for your own good.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.344
But...

40:48.346 --> 40:50.013
Come on. Come on.
What --

40:50.015 --> 40:53.016
Wait. Sharon,
what's for my own good?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.153
What are you doing?

40:58.222 --> 40:59.589
What's going on?

40:59.591 --> 41:01.691
[ door opens ]
provenza: Hello? Captain?

41:01.693 --> 41:03.359
Down the hall,
lieutenant!

41:03.361 --> 41:05.361
Why is lieutenant provenza
here?

41:05.363 --> 41:07.163
Ah, good news.

41:07.165 --> 41:08.665
Uh, since it's clear

41:08.667 --> 41:10.533
That it's not as safe here
as we would like,

41:10.535 --> 41:14.270
Until you testify in court,
you're coming to live with me.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.773
Wait. U-until I testify?

41:16.775 --> 41:19.042
But that could be years
from now.

41:19.044 --> 41:22.645
Not anymore. Besides staying
safe, you need to get ready.

41:22.647 --> 41:26.549
Rusty, next week, you take
the stand against phillip stroh.
