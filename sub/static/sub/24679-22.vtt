00:01.301 --> 00:03.804
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.871 --> 00:06.078
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.139 --> 00:08.745
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.683
These are their stories.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.456
TISH: It’s Twyla's most accessible work.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.688
I took a chance and got us tickets.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.858
I hope you like dance. I'm game for anything.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.962
I get so wrapped up in my work,

00:22.022 --> 00:24.798
I forget there's a whole
other world out there.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.065
It's time you enjoyed your life.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.034
Here's to...

00:30.030 --> 00:32.533
Here's to opening new doors.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.041
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

00:37.538 --> 00:39.245
It's my service. Sorry.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.843
Dr. Stern here. Mmm-hmm.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.045
Tell him the results are positive

00:44.111 --> 00:46.489
and we'll resolve the problem Friday.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.854
Oh, and no more calls tonight.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.893
JANICE: Come on, Melissa. It’s getting late.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.497
I'll see you Friday.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.132
Buzz, we're going to Florida next weekend.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.972
I don't want to go with Ted,
I want to go with Daddy.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.946
Oh, we will, honey. Real soon.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.508
I'll take us all to Florida.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.109
Give your Daddy a kiss. Get in the car.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.389
Buzz, you know about making promises.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.190
This is one I'm, I'm gonna keep.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.163
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:33.460 --> 01:36.600
Listen, I'll come in. So we're clear,

01:36.663 --> 01:38.643
you do not want to mess with me.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.810
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:45.238 --> 01:47.081
I just got into the city.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.747
What?

01:50.877 --> 01:52.413
But you...

01:54.514 --> 01:57.825
All right, I got it. Back of the train.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.826
You listen, no more changes.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.916
Hey!

02:22.976 --> 02:25.081
Help, I'm stuck!

02:25.545 --> 02:26.956
(SCREAMING)

02:29.349 --> 02:30.828
(GROANING)

03:26.907 --> 03:28.409
GILES: We have bloody shoe prints,

03:28.475 --> 03:31.149
a partial heading back to
the exit at the other end.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.555
- Why not use that exit?
- Out of order.

03:36.616 --> 03:40.120
Officer William Davis, Suffolk County PD.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.167
He's a long way from home.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.669
Well, he tried to let his
assailant know he was a cop.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.970
Would've been better off
reaching for his piece.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.176
He's wearing a vest. He expected trouble.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.872
He found it.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.980
So the killer...

04:00.607 --> 04:05.249
He threaded the bars of the
gate and found major arteries.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.258
He was sure-handed.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.290
Unless these wounds are just for show.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.524
Davis might've been trailing someone.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.529
A pen.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.166
No memo pad.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.337
TIMMINS: Buzz was a dedicated officer.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.972
If he was on someone's tail,
he'd just keep doggin' the guy.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.983
His case log has a butcher shop break-in,

04:33.039 --> 04:35.144
vandalism at a laundromat.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.513
Which of these was he dogging in the city?

04:37.577 --> 04:40.251
- It'd be in his memo book.
- GOREN: Which was swiped.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.895
According to this time sheet, he
punched out at 4:00 yesterday.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.022
You know how it is. You punch
out, you keep working.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.132
Cigarettes.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.461
From the reservation?

04:55.228 --> 04:57.071
A smuggling investigation?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.167
I'm not saying he was Serpico.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.976
If Buzz was killed in the line of duty,

05:06.173 --> 05:09.086
it doubles his family's death benefit.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.681
Okay.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.853
He's going through a divorce.
He's got child support, legal fees.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.155
So he's been moonlighting. Any other sidelines

05:16.216 --> 05:18.389
besides selling off-tax cigarettes?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.663
That's the only one I heard of.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.925
Maybe the one you didn't hear about

05:23.990 --> 05:26.368
is the one that caught up with him.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.275
EAMES: How come all divorced
cops have the same decorator?

05:34.968 --> 05:38.108
A diagnostic manual, medical encyclopedia.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.317
The PDR.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.054
Unless this guy's a hypochondriac,

05:45.111 --> 05:46.647
he's not reading these for pleasure.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.286
This was his bedtime reading.
Escort ads and 800 numbers.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.956
That painting.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.062
There was something bigger hanging here.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.911
How many 8-year-old girls
you know who like sports cars?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.479
Besides me?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.686
It’s freshly cut.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.400
Nothing.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.769
Unless that's what he was
picking up in the city.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.637
Something to stash in there.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.080
We were saying goodbye,

06:43.570 --> 06:46.073
and then he promised to take us to Florida.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.887
He said this time he meant it.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.216
And I almost believed him.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.252
He give any hint how he was
going to pay for this trip?

06:57.317 --> 06:59.263
No, but I figured it was his raise.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.491
What raise?

07:01.221 --> 07:04.031
He was up for a promotion, to detective.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.402
They probably told you that at the station.

07:06.459 --> 07:10.532
No, nobody mentioned it. Did he
say why he was being promoted?

07:10.597 --> 07:15.046
He was close to cracking a
very big case. Medicare fraud.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.443
That explains the medical books.

07:18.705 --> 07:23.120
You're a secretary, Janice,
at an insurance company?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.713
- A medical insurance company?
- Yes.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.228
I bet your adjusters use these
in the office all the time.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.993
If Buzz was investigating Medicare fraud,

07:35.288 --> 07:38.792
he'd need access to insurance records.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.541
Buzz being a quick-thinking cop,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.074
he would've looked for a shortcut.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.973
Especially if it was for critical information.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.842
He would've looked for a computer password,

07:53.206 --> 07:54.514
like this one here.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.448
Maybe your password?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.685
He said if I loaned him my password

08:04.751 --> 08:07.061
it would be like giving him
the last piece to the puzzle.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.462
He'd get promoted.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.361
And Melissa could be proud of her Daddy.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.577
The officer will take you home.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.615
Her company can tell us
what files he accessed.

08:32.278 --> 08:36.556
Maybe instead of investigating
fraud, Buzz was committing it.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.063
Buzz, he was boning up

08:40.120 --> 08:43.658
on infectious diseases.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.703
Infectious diseases

08:53.233 --> 08:54.769
and escort ads.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.082
Have you told anyone about me yet?

09:06.413 --> 09:08.359
There isn't much to tell yet.

09:08.615 --> 09:12.791
Other than outside a spa, I've never
seen so many jets in one shower.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.824
I like a clean body.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.100
You're so beautiful.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.234
There really isn't a jealous
boyfriend somewhere?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.808
No, not for the last 3 years.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.878
I've gotten used to being alone.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.851
From now on, you'll be anything but alone.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.715
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:41.981 --> 09:44.291
Hi, Bobby. I'm Angel.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.758
Come on in. Can I take your coat?

09:49.255 --> 09:52.998
Oh, hi. He didn't mention he had a friend.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.301
Actually, I'm his partner.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.242
Whatever. You're cute.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.809
Can you get me something from the mini?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.209
Oh.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.919
Right, "partner."

10:11.177 --> 10:14.215
Do you remember on the phone,
when I didn't discuss specifics?

10:14.547 --> 10:17.153
- I just came here for a little conversation.
- Save it.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.959
We just want to ask you about one
of your conversation buddies.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.157
I don't know him.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.896
You should. His phone records have
him calling you every other week.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.702
GOREN: Hey, you know, it's Friday night.

10:29.329 --> 10:33.903
I'm sure there's lots of guys out there
that are dying for, uh, conversation.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.909
But if you'd rather sit here
with us all night...

10:37.971 --> 10:40.542
Okay. I know him.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.678
Buzz, the cop, right?

10:43.376 --> 10:46.050
The first time we hooked up, he tinned me.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.383
Then he asked for a PBA discount.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.586
$50 bucks.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.194
I tell you, you give a guy a badge and...

10:57.190 --> 11:00.034
Did he ask about any of your other clients?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.398
All cops are nosy.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.470
What did he want to know about your clients?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.070
Just who they were, where they worked.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.642
Did he ask you if any of them had
a sexually transmitted disease

11:13.706 --> 11:15.049
or any other infections?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.679
Yeah, sure. But I think he
was just being careful.

11:20.046 --> 11:23.926
Your regulars, any of them
stop seeing you lately?

11:23.983 --> 11:26.429
Well, Reverend Tony

11:27.854 --> 11:30.300
and Mr. Cabezas, a couple others.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.860
We'll need telephone numbers,
whatever you have on them.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.405
Buzz could have been looking at
her Johns' medical histories

11:42.468 --> 11:44.778
and then using that information
to shake them down.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.839
And one of the Johns shook back.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.820
He said he was a police officer.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.415
He shows me a badge, and
then he asks me for money,

11:54.480 --> 11:58.121
otherwise he was gonna arrest me
in front of my wife and kids.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.186
He blackmailed you. How much?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.961
$1,600. That was all my savings.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.029
And what did he have on you?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.842
Evidence that you'd been treated

12:11.898 --> 12:13.673
for a sexually transmitted disease?

12:13.733 --> 12:16.145
No, no. I've never been treated for that.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.978
Listen, I know that what I
did with Angel was wrong,

12:19.038 --> 12:20.381
but it was safe.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.119
Buzz took him for $1,600.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.623
Pretty much the same
ballpark as the other Johns.

12:26.679 --> 12:30.252
But it doesn't seem like he was blackmailing
them with their medical records.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.922
Okay. As dirty as Davis was, he's
still a member of the family.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.958
Let's keep this from the
press, for his kid's sake.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.069
It would've taken 50 Johns to
fill up the hole in Buzz's wall.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.873
Buzz had to be going for bigger fish.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.379
Well, it looks like he was trying.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.938
The insurance company
tracked the files he accessed.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.782
The patient records of 3 doctors.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.752
2 on the Upper East Side,

12:57.710 --> 12:59.155
1 in Soho.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.689
Why would someone access my patient records?

13:02.749 --> 13:06.526
We believe the hacker was targeting
male patients with STDs.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.265
We refer those out.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.564
We're loathe to use antibiotics,
as are our patients.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.165
Dr. Kantor, you're not the
subject of this investigation.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.541
Of course not.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.605
You don't believe us.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.437
Is that because you've been
investigated before,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.950
because you practice unconventional medicine?

13:27.006 --> 13:28.178
Yes.

13:28.241 --> 13:32.189
The AMA, the insurance
companies, managed care.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.357
Has anybody bothered you lately?

13:36.883 --> 13:38.885
The IRS called about 4 weeks ago.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.589
They asked about your patients?

13:40.653 --> 13:44.260
The investigator had a tip that some of
them took inflated medical deductions.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.962
It was pure harassment.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.469
Who were the patients?

13:48.528 --> 13:49.666
One has lupus,

13:49.729 --> 13:52.642
the other a tropical disease she's
been fighting for the past few weeks.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.444
All women?

13:55.501 --> 13:58.107
Yes. And none of them had an STD.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.288
STERN: The last time I spoke
to the IRS was 8 years ago

14:04.344 --> 14:06.824
over a tax shelter my former
accountant got me into.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.793
Well, this would have been somebody
pretending to be an IRS investigator.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.497
The same somebody who hacked into
your patients' insurance records.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.862
Why would someone do that?

14:15.922 --> 14:19.131
We think he was looking for embarrassing
information to blackmail your patients.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.604
Maybe a married patient with an STD.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.537
I don't handle STDs. Not
my specialty. I'm more...

14:24.597 --> 14:26.907
GOREN: Internal medicine. Yale.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.709
And, uh, here you're being honored
for your work in South Africa,

14:32.939 --> 14:34.885
combating infectious diseases.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.226
We went into the townships,
we did what we could.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.557
The diseases we saw were fascinating.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.722
The way they mutate, they'll outlive us all.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.393
You didn't bring this little fellow
all the way from Africa, did you?

14:50.456 --> 14:53.869
Look, look, he brought a tiger
cub to the kids at St. Teresa's.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.167
STERN: There are no tigers in Africa.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.302
Not even in the Cape Town Zoo?

15:01.434 --> 15:04.074
We'd like to go through your
patients' files with you.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.380
See if anybody in there might fit
the bill as a blackmail victim.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.913
STERN: I highly doubt it's worth your time.

15:10.977 --> 15:14.823
Most of my patients have digestive
problems. Acid reflux, stuff like that.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.150
I have to tell you, it doesn't sound like

15:17.216 --> 15:18.786
the sort of thing blackmailers look for.

15:18.851 --> 15:23.664
Dr. Stern, I gotta tell you,
blackmailing is right up our alley.

15:24.590 --> 15:28.766
I mean, we are pretty good at
sniffing out potential victims.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.307
(CHUCKLING)

15:30.363 --> 15:32.707
My partner might be a little
hard on the furniture,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.439
but he's right about sniffing
out blackmail victims.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.775
STERN: There's just a little
matter of patient privilege.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.546
You should discuss this with my attorney.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.348
Let me give you his number.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.524
You're already fobbing
us off on your attorney?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.994
I don't like lawsuits from my patients.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.992
Your hand shakes.

15:55.988 --> 15:56.989
Uh-uh.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.761
It's either nerves, or an intention tremor.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.632
An intention tremor. It started in college.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.777
I guess that eliminated surgery for you.

16:09.168 --> 16:13.173
No loss. Even in college, I let my
lab partners do the dissecting.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.018
Stern couldn't have killed Buzz.

16:22.615 --> 16:27.086
Uh, he has a tremor. He lacks the
dexterity to have committed the crime.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.198
This turn-gate was vandalized.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.436
It was vandalized so that Buzz was forced

16:38.498 --> 16:41.308
to use the one closest to the staircase.

16:43.836 --> 16:48.717
Dr. Stern had a stainless steel
door on his cabinet rigged

16:48.774 --> 16:52.779
so he could look at the
changing area from his desk.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.417
He likes to watch.

16:58.017 --> 17:02.727
If he arranged to have Buzz killed,

17:02.788 --> 17:05.132
he would have wanted front row seats.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.329
From the staircase.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.340
So he sabotaged the other exit.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.569
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.270
The woman with the tropical disease

17:16.335 --> 17:18.144
slipped into a coma this morning.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.015
Until you look close, you can't
tell it's varnished macaroni.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.182
Isn't it fun?

17:27.246 --> 17:28.987
Yes. As advertised.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.186
Roger.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.626
What are you doing at an opening?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.791
Tish Van Der Wahl, meet Dr. Scott Borman.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.960
He's got some of the biggest
patients in New York.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.162
Really?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.668
You must be the one who brought Roger here.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.435
His idea of a big night is to stay
home and watch the Surgery Channel.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.807
Well, we're going to change all that.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.970
I bet you will.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.212
Tish, let me get you a refill.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.982
So, Scott, what's your specialty?

17:56.342 --> 17:57.878
Hands-on care.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.321
Roger's been keeping you under wraps.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.553
Now I see why.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.736
EAMES: Was Dr. Roger Stern

18:13.793 --> 18:15.568
one of the specialists you saw?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.608
Uh, I saw him, yes,

18:18.097 --> 18:21.909
but it was a while ago, for something
unrelated. Why do you ask?

18:22.501 --> 18:25.846
Well, someone hacked into his
records, and yours, Megan.

18:25.905 --> 18:30.752
And another woman, who's also being
treated for an unknown viral infection.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.380
Emily Wagner?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.349
EAMES: You know her?

18:35.414 --> 18:39.328
I got a call, and they mentioned
her name but I don't...

18:39.385 --> 18:42.457
A call from somebody with the IRS.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.994
Yes. He said he was investigating

18:45.057 --> 18:47.765
some of Dr. Stern's business expenses.

18:49.428 --> 18:53.843
He tried deducting the dinners
that you had together.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.337
You dated him.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.815
How did it end?

19:00.740 --> 19:04.085
We just... we went our own ways.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.453
He was married to his practice.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.287
Was there any other reason for the breakup?

19:11.550 --> 19:15.760
No. Would you excuse me? I'm awfully tired.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.993
Sure, sure.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.366
I just thought, being a germaphobic,

19:19.425 --> 19:22.065
Dr. Stern broke up with you
when you got sick.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.067
No, I got sick after.

19:26.265 --> 19:29.371
Oh. Well, we'll show ourselves out.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.650
Typhoid Roger. You dump him, you get sick.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.779
Blackmail him, you get killed.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.683
The CDC determined one woman was infected

19:42.748 --> 19:46.127
with Rift Valley fever,
the other with Nipah virus.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.765
They're obscure, potentially
lethal zoonotic viruses,

19:50.823 --> 19:52.700
meaning they're found in animals.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.005
Anything I could catch from my local vet?

19:55.061 --> 19:57.132
Not unless he's been in
the Southern Hemisphere

19:57.196 --> 19:58.971
playing fetch with flying bats.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.535
Then these woman were more likely
deliberately, uh, infected?

20:02.601 --> 20:05.445
Assuming you could get hold of the viruses.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.011
DEAKINS: Well, thanks, Doc.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.054
Let's keep in lock-step with the CDC
and the Health Department, huh?

20:10.276 --> 20:11.778
We're already best friends.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.955
Even if you connect Stern to these women,

20:17.683 --> 20:19.594
the guy's an acid reflux specialist.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.859
How does he get his hands on these bugs?

20:21.987 --> 20:24.263
The tiger cub. I need to
track down the tiger cub.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.527
GOREN: Thanks.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.067
The tiger cub that Stern
brought to the hospital

20:31.130 --> 20:32.803
was from the Hudson Zoo,

20:33.365 --> 20:36.676
where his donations have made him
a special friend of the zoo.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.251
And where he's taken seminars
on veterinary sciences.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.885
BORMAN: Two civilians contaminated?

20:47.947 --> 20:49.255
That's pretty wild.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.390
Do you keep specimens of these viruses?

20:53.819 --> 20:56.425
Uh, the lab keeps cultures

20:57.490 --> 20:58.992
for diagnostic purposes.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.434
If you need to change, Dr.
Borman, we can wait outside.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.341
Oh, that's okay.

21:05.364 --> 21:09.039
We're all mammals in here. Right, ladies?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.842
Whatever you say, Doctor.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.450
You do know, of course, that zoonotic

21:21.647 --> 21:24.355
doesn't mean that the
viruses came from the zoo.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.397
It doesn't? My partner was telling me that.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.558
But it doesn't make sense to me,
because there's the word "zoo."

21:30.623 --> 21:33.001
Guys. We never listen.

21:35.861 --> 21:39.502
You conducted seminars

21:39.999 --> 21:41.706
for special friends of the zoo.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.372
Well, the directors think I'm a
good ambassador for the zoo.

21:47.606 --> 21:51.144
Because you have so much in
common with your animals?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.753
Like Tarzan, right?

21:54.346 --> 21:57.327
There's a doctor, a Dr. Roger Stern.

21:57.783 --> 22:01.492
- He attended some of your seminars.
- Sure.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.624
Oh, these guys are like groupies.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.499
They, uh, take one lecture,
and go on a field trip.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.232
They think they're saving the planet.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.864
Would you hand me those?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.202
(SCOFFS)

22:13.632 --> 22:17.102
Did Dr. Stern ever ask you
about Nipah or RVF virus?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.479
No, no, no.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.510
But one of your seminars
was about zoonotic viruses.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.283
Well, it was on arenaviruses.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.449
A completely different viridae.

22:27.513 --> 22:31.928
We classify viruses with what
we call the Baltimore system.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.362
You've lost me.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.897
It doesn't matter.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.068
Uh, well,

22:40.259 --> 22:42.000
it's almost showtime.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.637
We have a male hyena
that we're going to neuter.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.507
You are welcome to stay and watch me operate.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.979
It's quite a specimen.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.574
That's okay. I've seen my share of specimens.

23:00.145 --> 23:03.422
It is fascinating how they
complement each other.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.020
Tarzan and Dr. Stern?

23:07.152 --> 23:10.622
Stern likes to watch,
Borman likes to be watched.

23:15.194 --> 23:18.198
Megan's reasons for breaking up with Stern...

23:18.530 --> 23:20.669
There's something she's not telling us.

23:23.202 --> 23:27.150
The Health Department told
me it's an animal virus.

23:27.306 --> 23:29.411
I can't imagine how I got it.

23:30.542 --> 23:34.285
Well, before you fell ill,
you were dating Dr. Stern.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.294
You might have gone someplace
where you got exposed.

23:38.350 --> 23:42.355
I don't see how. We went
to the theater, to the opera.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.695
He showed you a good time.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.599
Yeah, I did most of the showing.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.228
He said he hadn't been to the Met

23:47.293 --> 23:49.796
since his mother dragged him
to La Boheme when he was ten.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.436
EAMES: I hope he appreciated your efforts.

23:52.498 --> 23:56.446
He said before he met me,
his life was bereft.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.310
EAMES: That must have been nice to hear.

24:00.339 --> 24:02.410
And you showed him new things.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.679
So if...

24:06.812 --> 24:09.452
If he asked you to do things
that you hadn't done before,

24:09.515 --> 24:12.359
you might try it, just to make him happy.

24:12.584 --> 24:16.430
Well, yes, within reason, I guess.

24:17.957 --> 24:22.770
Did he ever ask you anything involved
with his friend, Dr. Scott Borman?

24:28.067 --> 24:31.014
I was so dumb not to have seen it.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.607
How did it happen?

24:37.142 --> 24:39.884
I was at Roger's. We'd been drinking.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.923
The doorbell rang. It was Scott.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.188
He said he was in the neighborhood.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.325
It didn't occur to me they'd planned it.

24:48.454 --> 24:50.058
So you drank a little more,

24:50.122 --> 24:51.999
one of them made a suggestion...

24:52.057 --> 24:54.162
Yeah, I thought they were joking.

24:54.226 --> 24:58.265
But Roger said it would draw us closer.

25:00.833 --> 25:05.475
Roger kind of drifted away,
and Scott took his place

25:07.239 --> 25:08.513
in bed with me.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.485
And right away, it felt wrong.

25:10.542 --> 25:14.046
And so I looked to Roger. He was
sitting next to the bed, staring.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.592
I got scared.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.089
With the way that he was looking at you?

25:21.653 --> 25:24.691
Yeah, I felt humiliated. I wanted him to stop.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.100
I started crying,

25:26.158 --> 25:28.365
and he got this

25:29.428 --> 25:30.998
little smile.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.834
He saw me crying, and he smiled.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.679
EAMES: After this, you stopped seeing him?

25:36.735 --> 25:40.581
He kept calling, apologizing.
I told him there was no going back.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.385
GOREN: But you did see him again?

25:44.943 --> 25:48.447
Well, I agreed to have dinner, in public.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.061
When I got there, he gave me
a "no hard feelings" gift.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.721
A pair of earrings.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.564
And he insisted putting them on you.

25:58.957 --> 25:59.958
Yes.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.363
But with that hand tremor of his...

26:02.428 --> 26:05.932
He pricked me. My earlobe started bleeding.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.612
Tish, please. You're having a bad reaction.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.081
A bad reaction?

26:13.138 --> 26:15.414
There's nothing wrong with
me, Roger. It’s you.

26:15.474 --> 26:18.580
Take a look in the mirror. I
can't believe I almost... Don't!

26:19.611 --> 26:21.750
Just stay away from me.

26:35.194 --> 26:39.540
Stuck-up little prude. It’s too
bad we have to let this one go.

26:42.267 --> 26:46.477
I'm not kidding, Roger. We
can't afford another mistake.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.009
Get past it, Scott.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.060
They infect these women for revenge?

26:59.485 --> 27:00.691
Maybe.

27:01.854 --> 27:06.667
Most killers get satisfaction
from witnessing their handiwork.

27:06.725 --> 27:10.571
Not these two. When they inject these women,

27:10.896 --> 27:13.001
it's fire and forget.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.673
A voyeur and an exhibitionist.
It’s a wonder they found each other.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.771
Isn't the world a swell place?

27:19.838 --> 27:22.682
The lab tests on Megan's
earrings was inconclusive.

27:22.741 --> 27:26.450
But the jewelry store said they sold
Dr. Stern 4 pairs of earrings.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.389
One was returned by Emily Wagner.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.755
The woman in a coma.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.991
She returned it 2 days before she
first reported symptoms to her doctor.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.921
Let me find a judge.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.892
When you leave, I want everything
back where you found it.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.699
Housekeeping duties aren't
stipulated in the warrant.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.238
What's this autoclave for?
To steam vegetables?

27:45.030 --> 27:46.907
Huh? Get him out of here.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.068
Let's get everybody out of here.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.841
Uh, we need a HAZMAT team.

28:27.773 --> 28:32.620
Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever, Lassa,
anthrax, alpha pathogens.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.617
The baddest boys on the block.

28:35.681 --> 28:38.025
Everything was safe and sealed,

28:38.083 --> 28:39.721
or I wouldn't keep them in my home.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.423
Where'd you get these specimens?

28:41.486 --> 28:44.763
The Bolivian and the Lassa
I acquired from doctors

28:44.923 --> 28:46.732
who encountered them in the field.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.139
And the anthrax? Because
there are a lot of people here

28:50.195 --> 28:53.267
interested in knowing how you
got your hands on a bio-weapon.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.842
It's from South Africa. A fellow
collector in their defense department.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.939
I can give you his name.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.143
I should have gotten rid of it, I know.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.652
I will pay a fine. I won't do it again.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.315
If it were only that easy.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.486
Our lab told us

29:10.682 --> 29:13.993
some of the vials have been
opened recently and resealed.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.693
Those open vials included
the Nipah virus and RVF.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.861
Two women that you dated were
infected with these same viruses.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.899
I have 267 specimens.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.540
Whatever virus anyone gets in this
city I probably have in my collection.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.141
Ah.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.276
Or you infected these women

29:35.340 --> 29:38.514
because they wouldn't be part of
your other little collection.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.579
The one you share with Dr. Borman?

29:41.013 --> 29:44.119
Oh? This sounds rich.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.921
Megan Colby told us when she
opted out of your health plan,

29:48.987 --> 29:51.900
you infected her with a pair of earrings.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.367
Like this pair we found in your home.

29:56.094 --> 29:58.335
Which lucky lady are these for?

29:59.031 --> 30:00.169
No one. Poor Megan.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.940
You know, the viruses can impair memory.

30:03.568 --> 30:04.808
Even cause paranoia.

30:05.704 --> 30:09.208
She had a very clear memory of the look
in your eyes when you were watching her.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.348
STERN: And I see my lawyer's here.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.685
Our threesome's over.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.923
Lab says the virus strains
in the women are too degraded

30:21.987 --> 30:24.263
to match with the ones in his collection.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.064
As far as finding other victims,

30:26.124 --> 30:30.163
now we have 267 pathogens
Stern might have used.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.901
This just doesn't stop.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.739
If Buzz Davis hadn't tried to
put the squeeze on Dr. Stern,

30:34.800 --> 30:37.610
he might have actually busted this
case and earned his promotion.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.913
Stern kept his specimens sorted
according to the Baltimore system.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.852
But this one vial,

30:47.713 --> 30:49.317
it's out of order.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.525
It's a rabies virus.

30:52.451 --> 30:56.422
Of all the pathogens, he was
only using the zoonotics.

30:56.488 --> 30:57.762
Animal virus.

30:57.823 --> 31:01.498
At least we can narrow our search
to women with those infections.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.338
He said I was the missing piece in his life.

31:05.797 --> 31:08.869
I really thought he enjoyed
going to art galleries, plays,

31:08.934 --> 31:12.882
all the sissy things he said his
mother tried to interest him in.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.915
Sissy things? He used those words?

31:17.943 --> 31:20.014
That's what his father called them.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.420
Did he say anything else about his father?

31:23.482 --> 31:26.793
Just that he was in shipping.
Worked himself to death.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.262
Roger didn't want that happening to him.

31:29.688 --> 31:33.329
Those finer things, did they
include his friend, Scott Borman?

31:34.860 --> 31:37.636
Actually, Scott's the one who introduced us.

31:37.829 --> 31:40.708
I used to volunteer at the zoo as a docent.

31:41.266 --> 31:44.247
Did Scott do anything besides introduce you?

31:45.704 --> 31:47.741
Okay, look, I really
don't want to revisit that.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.685
It's a thing, it happened, that's it.

31:51.543 --> 31:54.649
After that, did you go back
to work at the zoo?

31:55.580 --> 31:59.027
And risk running into Scott? No. I resigned.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.057
You had to go back to get your things.

32:01.119 --> 32:02.689
ANAIS: They sent them to me.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.632
What exactly?

32:05.724 --> 32:08.637
Stupid things. A sweater, makeup,

32:08.794 --> 32:11.001
my case for my contact lenses.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.278
You wear contacts?

32:15.333 --> 32:16.710
ANAIS: I used to.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.144
Before the infection.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.978
My lawyer will be here soon.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.023
But if you wanna tell me what these
assault charges are all about...

32:27.078 --> 32:31.026
It has to do with infecting one of the
volunteers at the zoo with a virus.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.688
BORMAN: Excuse me?

32:32.784 --> 32:35.355
Anais Hutchinson. She dated Roger Stern.

32:36.988 --> 32:40.333
We've been wracking our brains
trying to figure out

32:40.392 --> 32:43.396
how a zoonotic virus, the Hendra virus,

32:44.196 --> 32:47.006
went from his little wine cooler

32:47.532 --> 32:52.208
into a contact lens case that
was left by her at the zoo.

32:53.371 --> 32:55.351
EAMES: That's how she was infected.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.783
The rewetting solution in
the case was contaminated.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.221
You didn't tell us

33:05.283 --> 33:08.594
just how close you and Dr. Stern were.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.431
The ladies are talking, Scott.
You wanna know what they said?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.028
Tell me everything. Don't leave out a word.

33:15.694 --> 33:19.471
I'll tell you. What they're
talking about is how

33:20.866 --> 33:23.745
after you and Roger tag-teamed them...

33:23.835 --> 33:27.544
They couldn't find soap strong
enough to get rid of the stench.

33:28.974 --> 33:32.183
Well, they weren't singing the blues
when I was plowing the field.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.449
Roger dumped them.

33:36.047 --> 33:40.291
As much as it turned him on to watch
them with me, he'd get jealous.

33:41.086 --> 33:44.067
EAMES: No, they bailed
out of your little freak show.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.533
And then the next thing they knew...

33:45.590 --> 33:49.037
They were hooked to an IV being
pumped full of antivirals.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.638
Please.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.070
Miss Hutchinson worked at a zoo.

33:53.131 --> 33:55.202
Wild beasts rolling around in their own feces.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.643
You said that he got jealous.

34:02.908 --> 34:05.411
Well, maybe he thought

34:05.477 --> 34:08.617
that he was being taken advantage of, by you.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.956
- Well, I don't see that.
- EAMES: Well, he's a Park Avenue doctor.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.893
- EAMES: You're a vet.
- GOREN: Yeah. I mean,

34:13.952 --> 34:18.867
he's doing all the work, bagging all these
beautiful, cultured young socialites.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.493
What do you bring to the table?

34:21.359 --> 34:23.498
What do I bring? Well, I'll tell you.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.467
Roger can't satisfy these women.

34:26.797 --> 34:29.277
That's where I come in. I seal the deal,

34:29.534 --> 34:32.447
and Roger likes to watch.

34:32.971 --> 34:36.282
See these women going out of
their mind with pleasure.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.652
If I'm guilty of anything,

34:39.710 --> 34:42.715
it's spoiling these girls for other men.

34:51.523 --> 34:55.471
His Speedos must be pinching off
the blood supply to his brain.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.632
In the midst of all his strutting,

34:57.696 --> 35:01.075
he did present an alternative theory
to Miss Hutchinson's infection.

35:01.132 --> 35:03.408
One that creates a reasonable doubt.

35:05.070 --> 35:08.051
If both doctors hold to their stories...

35:08.106 --> 35:10.950
You know, we know Scott's story,

35:11.009 --> 35:13.319
but we don't know Roger's.

35:13.378 --> 35:17.019
Now, he said that seeing
women being pleasured

35:17.515 --> 35:20.052
was what Roger found exciting.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.898
But Megan saw something else in the
way that Roger was looking at her.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.563
- He was getting off on her humiliation.
- Yes.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.469
Scott and Roger were using these
women to meet their needs.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.808
But I doubt they really know
what each ether's needs are.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.514
It's time that we show them.

35:47.112 --> 35:50.559
Why don't you just copy the form you
filled out when you first arrested me?

35:52.083 --> 35:55.428
It's ridiculous. My lawyer told me
I'm supposed to get bail today.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.660
GOREN: Okay, your father's name.

35:57.889 --> 35:58.959
Joseph.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.259
(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING)

36:00.325 --> 36:01.895
His occupation.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.134
Your father's occupation.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.308
Longshoreman.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.576
That's right, shipping.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.577
What are you looking at?

36:12.837 --> 36:15.716
Nothing. I'm just thinking about
these preposterous charges.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.553
Well, we feel pretty good about them.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.026
And our witnesses.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.457
Like Megan Colby?

36:27.018 --> 36:29.999
Her character leaves a lot to be desired.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.535
He was right. You are jealous.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.764
No, Dr. Borman told us that
you're jealous of his prowess.

36:37.829 --> 36:38.899
That's nonsense.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.567
He said that you couldn't satisfy them,

36:40.632 --> 36:44.478
so you brought him in to pick up the slack.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.277
He told us that it turned you on

36:47.338 --> 36:49.978
to see what a good time
they were having with him.

36:50.108 --> 36:53.521
And that excitement, well,
gave way to jealousy.

36:53.578 --> 36:55.057
No, he's a brute.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.993
A pig. Why would I be jealous of a pig?

36:59.384 --> 37:00.385
Hmm.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.992
Scott told us that your girlfriends
had the time of their life with him.

37:05.056 --> 37:09.368
What are you talking about?
They were debased, humiliated.

37:09.427 --> 37:11.930
I turned them into the corncob in the pigsty,

37:11.996 --> 37:14.101
with that rutting hog on top of them.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.839
They'd look at me, wanting
me to call him off!

37:18.937 --> 37:20.939
They wanted you to save them?

37:24.209 --> 37:26.450
We have to redo his booking form, too.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.816
Well, I won't be long with Dr. Stern.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.325
Have a seat right there.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.691
GOREN: Now, where were we?
Your mother, I need her name.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.393
- Vivian.
- Vivian. That's nice. Sophisticated.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.933
One of your girlfriends told us that Vivian

37:39.991 --> 37:42.471
- used to take you to the opera. Is that true?
- Yes.

37:42.527 --> 37:46.100
She wanted to enrich your young
life. You must've liked that.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.812
EAMES: I bet your mother never
dragged you to the opera.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.211
Yeah, she knew better.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.715
Well, Roger here, now, he got stuck

37:53.772 --> 37:56.013
doing all the sissy things with his mother.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.151
Isn't that what his father called it?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.155
That's right. Sissy things.

38:00.245 --> 38:04.421
You know something just occurred to me.
Those women, Megan, the others.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.958
They were trying to change you.

38:09.721 --> 38:10.995
Like your mother.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.266
Let's leave her out of this.

38:16.327 --> 38:19.103
No, Vivian didn't want you
to end up like your Dad.

38:19.831 --> 38:23.802
A brute of a longshoreman,
working himself to death.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.172
My parents respected each other.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.114
Why don't you just tell the truth, Roger?

38:28.173 --> 38:29.914
That everything you did wrong,

38:29.974 --> 38:34.616
Mom said it was because of
your Dad's side of the family.

38:34.879 --> 38:37.519
Your mother, she put on airs.

38:38.950 --> 38:39.951
Like Megan.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.328
She made you do sissy things.

38:42.453 --> 38:45.593
GOREN: But you were too young
to do anything about it.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.796
But then you became an adult,

38:48.426 --> 38:51.202
and you found a way

38:51.262 --> 38:53.902
to square things up.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.679
That little scenario, what
we talked about earlier,

38:59.370 --> 39:03.318
the one with Scott and Megan.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.851
He is kind of like your Dad.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.898
Forget it. It’s dime-store psychology.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.865
GOREN: Even so, there is something to it.

39:17.922 --> 39:21.836
When you used him to humiliate
those women, to degrade them,

39:24.229 --> 39:26.539
that was your mother being humiliated.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.072
Your mother being degraded.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.578
Sorry to tell you, Scott, but it wasn't
your technique that turned him on.

39:43.214 --> 39:48.061
It was the humiliation that he
inflicted on them by using you.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.291
What is it that you said you did?

39:50.355 --> 39:53.302
You turned them into the corncob in a pigsty.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.429
And, well, Scott, you're the pig.

39:55.493 --> 39:58.406
- STERN: That's not true. I never said that.
- I'm no pig.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.908
Women crave me. Roger knows that.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.540
Oh. Does he?

Oh, look.

They were debased, humiliated.

I turned them into the corncob in the pigsty,

40:26.491 --> 40:28.437

he got them sick with animal viruses.

Like you, Scott, the rutting hog.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.257
He's the animal, not me.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.823
- He did it to them.
- Shut up, you dope.

40:57.889 --> 41:01.268
It was his idea to punish
them. He infected them.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.585
You know what he does all day?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.192
You know where he puts his hands?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.097
He's a filthy animal, a pig.

41:32.457 --> 41:35.336
He's a killer. He killed Buzz Davis.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.997
Yes, yes, that's right,
A killer. A wild beast.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.367
And you watched.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.215
I'm not like him

41:48.339 --> 41:50.012
I'm nothing like him.

41:55.313 --> 41:59.659
Both Dr. Stern and Dr. Borman are willing
to plead to multiple counts of assault.

42:00.084 --> 42:03.998
Stern offered to roll on Borman
for the murder of Officer Davis.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.133
How much time just on the assaults?

42:07.191 --> 42:11.367
Separate counts to be served consecutively,
minimum 15 years each count.

42:11.896 --> 42:15.742
So they'd be very old men before
they got out, if they ever get out.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.906
And if no one's prosecuted
for Buzz Davis' murder,

42:19.003 --> 42:22.109
the circumstance of his death
wouldn't be on the record.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.379
CARVER: That's true, but...

42:23.441 --> 42:26.752
For all anybody'd know,
he died in the line of duty.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.491
It matters?

42:29.747 --> 42:31.818
Yeah. It matters to his daughter.

42:50.902 --> 42:51.903
What is it?

42:54.605 --> 42:56.915
The South African source for Stern's anthrax.

42:56.974 --> 43:00.387
He told the FBI he gave Stern
5 grams of the stuff.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.588
But our lab only found
3 in Stern's collection.

43:09.053 --> 43:10.327
(SIGHING)

43:11.305 --> 43:17.907
