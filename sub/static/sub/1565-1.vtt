03:03.840 --> 03:05.890
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.810
Mr Romales and his friends will be out of business.

03:08.930 --> 03:13.060
He won't be using heroin-flavoured bananas to finance revolutions.

03:14.370 --> 03:17.190
Don't go back to your hotel, ser. They'll be watching you.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.490
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but

03:22.610 --> 03:25.700
first I have some unfinished business to attend to.

03:45.470 --> 03:47.010
Forgive me.

03:47.140 --> 03:49.180
Why do you always wear that thing?

03:49.310 --> 03:51.680
I have a slight inferiority complex.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.850
Where was I?

04:49.780 --> 04:51.620
Shocking!

04:55.830 --> 04:57.880
Positively shocking.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.320
Goldfinger.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.990
He's the man.

05:28.110 --> 05:31.700
The man with the Midas touch.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.700
A spider's touch.

05:38.750 --> 05:42.250
Such a cold finger.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.880
Beckons you.

05:47.010 --> 05:50.390
To enter his web of sin.

05:52.510 --> 05:56.430
But don't go in.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.360
Golden words he will pour in your ear.

06:03.020 --> 06:07.190
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.

06:07.650 --> 06:09.700
For a golden girl.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.160
Knows when he's kissed her.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.250
It's the kiss of death.

06:16.370 --> 06:20.420
From Mr Goldfinger.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.710
Pretty girl.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.170
Beware of this heart of gold.

06:30.300 --> 06:34.470
This heart is cold.

06:36.270 --> 06:40.270
Golden words he will pour in your ear.

06:40.810 --> 06:44.900
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.780
For a golden girl.

06:48.150 --> 06:50.200
Knows when he's kissed her.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.700
It's the kiss of death.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.660
From Mr Goldfinger.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.420
Pretty girl.

07:02.540 --> 07:07.550
Beware of this heart of gold.

07:07.920 --> 07:12.550
This heart is cold.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.970
He loves only gold.

07:17.390 --> 07:21.520
Only gold.

07:21.770 --> 07:25.770
He loves gold.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.860
He loves only gold.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.990
Only gold.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.740
He loves gold.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.070
- How's this?
- It's nice... Very nice.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.540
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.

09:03.660 --> 09:07.080
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

09:07.210 --> 09:10.790
Felix! How are you?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.960
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!

09:13.090 --> 09:15.130
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.300
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

09:17.430 --> 09:19.470
Man talk.

09:21.310 --> 09:25.230
You must be slipping, 007, letting the opposition get that close to you.

09:25.350 --> 09:27.600
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.860
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.570
Not any more, you're not. Signal from London.

09:32.690 --> 09:36.280
I knew M wouldn't book me into the best hotel here out of gratitude.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.490
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

09:38.610 --> 09:41.700
Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a French nail varnish!

09:41.830 --> 09:44.200
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.370
Big operator, worldwide interests. All seem reputable.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.540
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.

09:49.670 --> 09:52.540
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.710
And where do I find him?

10:01.970 --> 10:04.220
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

10:04.350 --> 10:08.230
Goldfinger's been taking him to the cleaners every day for a week.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.320
Morning, Mr Simmons! Ready for our little game?

10:14.440 --> 10:18.280
Sure. When you're ten grand in the hole, you're ready for anything.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.070
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!

10:22.200 --> 10:24.330
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.910
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.080
Five dollars a point.

10:31.580 --> 10:34.630
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.090
OK.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.760
I'll get back and cable M you're on the job.

10:40.880 --> 10:44.050
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.780
- Four.
- So soon?

11:02.910 --> 11:04.700
How many?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.870
7, 12, 18, 32,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.040
44.

11:20.590 --> 11:21.680
Miss?

11:21.800 --> 11:23.840
Hey, what are you...?

11:24.260 --> 11:26.310
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!

11:26.430 --> 11:28.470
Yes, I know.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.020
You're very sweet.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.450
He just drew the king of clubs. That makes his count 59.

11:42.610 --> 11:45.200
He's got a diamond run: Eight, nine, ten.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.910
He's holding on to the six of spades, so I guess he thinks you want it.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.460
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.420
He needs kings and queens.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.840
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.060
Come on, come on!

12:18.110 --> 12:19.650
That's more like it!

12:21.070 --> 12:23.110
- What's your name?
- Jill.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.660
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.000
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.870
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.800
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.840
Just seen?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.550
Just seen.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.720
I'm so glad.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.270
You're much too nice to be mixed up in anything like this, you know.

12:58.810 --> 13:02.650
Now hear this, Goldfinger. Your luck has just changed.

13:02.780 --> 13:07.320
I doubt if the Miami Beach police would take kindly to what you're doing.

13:08.490 --> 13:11.160
Nod your head if you agree.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.330
Nod.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.870
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.130
Shall we say $10,000?

13:20.250 --> 13:22.300
No, let's be generous.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.470
Let's make it $15,000.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.180
May I see?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.230
Hell, I can see this is really my day!

13:38.350 --> 13:40.400
Gin!

13:48.160 --> 13:50.820
Over and out.

13:50.950 --> 13:53.910
That should keep him occupied for quite some time.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.080
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.750
Call me James.

13:58.870 --> 14:02.090
More than anyone I've met in a long time... James.

14:03.550 --> 14:06.380
What on earth are we going to do about it?

14:06.510 --> 14:08.880
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.050
Where?

14:11.180 --> 14:13.390
Well, I know the best place in town.

14:33.700 --> 14:37.200
Station WEDS brings you the latest in world news.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.580
Washington. At the White House today,

14:39.710 --> 14:42.670
the President said he was entirely satisfied...

14:46.960 --> 14:49.010
That makes two of us.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.060
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

14:58.180 --> 15:00.230
Felix! Well, now?

15:00.350 --> 15:02.400
What's that? Dinner?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.570
No, look, I'm sorry.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.230
I can't. Something big's come up.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.280
How about breakfast?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.450
OK Not too early.

15:13.570 --> 15:17.490
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.660
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.010
It's lost its chill!

15:37.100 --> 15:39.850
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.

15:40.850 --> 15:44.520
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.

15:44.690 --> 15:47.440
Such as drinking Dom Pignon '53

15:47.570 --> 15:50.400
above a temperature of 38?Fahrenheit.

15:50.530 --> 15:52.990
That's as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.540
Now... where is this passion juice?

16:37.830 --> 16:38.990
Jill?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.119
Yes, Mr Bond?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.579
Beach 79432. Room 119.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.920
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.050
Get over here right away.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.550
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.560
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.940
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.820
Gold?

17:57.950 --> 17:59.950
All over?

18:00.070 --> 18:03.580
She died of skin suffocation. It can happen to cabaret dancers.

18:03.700 --> 18:07.040
You should leave a small bare patch at the base of the spine

18:07.160 --> 18:09.210
to allow the skin to breathe.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.170
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.260
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.430
It's an assignment like any other.

18:21.550 --> 18:25.520
And if you can't treat it as such, coldly and objectively,

18:25.640 --> 18:27.690
008 can replace you.

18:29.770 --> 18:32.060
You've hardly distinguished yourself.

18:32.190 --> 18:35.860
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger. Not borrow his girlfriend.

18:36.030 --> 18:39.570
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe and it's only thanks to Leiter

18:39.700 --> 18:41.780
and my diplomatic intervention

18:41.910 --> 18:44.700
that you're not being held by the Miami Beach police!

18:44.830 --> 18:46.870
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.540
But I'm prepared to continue this assignment in the spirit you suggest

18:51.670 --> 18:54.340
if I knew what it was about,

18:54.460 --> 18:56.210
sir.

18:56.340 --> 18:59.090
What do you know about gold? Not paint, bullion.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.890
I know it when I see it.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.850
Meet me here at seven.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.020
Black tie.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.990
What do you know about gold, Moneypenny?

19:18.110 --> 19:20.860
The only gold I know about is the kind you wear.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.530
You know, on the third finger of your left hand.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.200
One of these days we really must look into that.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.830
What about tonight? Come round for dinner

19:29.500 --> 19:32.040
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.420
Nothing would give me greater pleasure

19:34.540 --> 19:38.050
but unfortunately I do have a... business appointment.

19:38.170 --> 19:41.220
That's the flimsiest excuse you've ever given me!

19:41.340 --> 19:43.800
Some girls have all the luck!

19:44.090 --> 19:46.970
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

19:47.100 --> 19:51.310
and kindly omit the customary by-play with 007. He's dining with me

19:51.440 --> 19:53.520
and I don't want him to be late.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.150
So there's hope for me yet?

19:57.860 --> 19:59.900
Moneypenny...

20:00.030 --> 20:02.070
Won't you ever believe me?

20:03.820 --> 20:05.870
We here at the Bank of England

20:05.990 --> 20:08.790
are the official depository for gold bullion.

20:08.910 --> 20:12.080
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky, is for the United States.

20:12.210 --> 20:16.170
We know the amounts we each hold and the amounts deposited in other banks.

20:16.290 --> 20:19.590
We can estimate what is being held for industrial purposes.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.010
Thus, both governments can establish

20:22.130 --> 20:24.470
the true value of the dollar and the pound.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.970
Consequently, we are concerned with unauthorised leakages.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.140
I take it you mean smuggling.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.770
Yes.

20:31.890 --> 20:36.610
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted down and recast, is all but untraceable,

20:36.730 --> 20:40.030
which makes it, unlike diamonds, ideal for smuggling,

20:40.150 --> 20:43.400
attracting the biggest and most ingenious criminals.

20:43.530 --> 20:46.660
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

20:46.780 --> 20:50.080
Have a little more of this... rather disappointing brandy.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.870
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.040
indifferently blended, sir.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.000
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

20:59.130 --> 21:01.800
Colonel Smithers is giving the lecture, 007.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.050
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger has gold bullion on deposit

21:07.180 --> 21:10.970
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong - worth?0 million.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.390
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

21:14.520 --> 21:17.230
The price of gold varies from country to country.

21:17.350 --> 21:21.570
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce, you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

21:21.690 --> 21:23.650
and triple your money.

21:23.780 --> 21:26.990
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?

21:27.110 --> 21:30.740
Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...

21:30.870 --> 21:32.750
No, that's not quite fair.

21:32.870 --> 21:37.420
Is, among his many other interests, a legitimate international jeweller.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.960
He's legally entitled to operate modest metallurgical installations.

21:42.090 --> 21:44.550
His British one is down in Kent.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.930
We've failed to discover how he transfers his gold overseas.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.890
And Lord knows we've tried.

21:50.010 --> 21:53.970
If your department can establish that it is done illegally,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.270
the bank can take action to recover most of his holdings.

21:57.390 --> 21:59.860
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.020
Socially, of course.

22:02.150 --> 22:04.190
I was hoping you'd say that.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.700
It might lead to a business talk... Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.870
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.

22:10.990 --> 22:14.830
This is the only one we have from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.

22:14.950 --> 22:17.000
But there are undoubtedly others.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.460
Mr Bond can make whatever use of it he thinks fit.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.880
Providing he returns it, of course.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.050
It's worth 5,000.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.350
You'll draw it from Q branch with your equipment in the morning.

22:33.470 --> 22:35.060
Of course, sir.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.330
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.

22:53.450 --> 22:55.490
This way, please.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.710
My, we are busy this morning!

23:03.710 --> 23:05.750
It's not perfected yet.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.510
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

23:09.630 --> 23:12.550
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

23:12.680 --> 23:17.180
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5 with modifications.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.350
Now, pay attention, please.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.570
Windscreen - bulletproof. As are the side and the rear windows.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.820
Revolving number plates, naturally.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.990
Valid all countries.

23:30.950 --> 23:34.620
Here's a nice little transmitting device, called a homer.

23:34.740 --> 23:38.250
You prime it by pressing that back like this. You see?

23:38.370 --> 23:41.120
The smaller model is now standard field issue,

23:41.250 --> 23:43.580
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.750
Its larger brother is magnetic.

23:46.420 --> 23:51.300
Right. It'll be concealed in the car you're trailing while you keep out of sight.

23:52.470 --> 23:54.510
Reception

23:54.640 --> 23:56.680
on the dashboard here.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.560
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.360
Ingenious, and useful too.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.270
Allow a man to stop off for a quick one en route.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.150
It has not been perfected out of years of patient research

24:10.280 --> 24:12.490
entirely for that purpose, 007.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.870
And incidentally we'd appreciate its return, along with your other equipment.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.870
Intact, for once, when you return from the field.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.210
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear that goes on out there in the field.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.550
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour

24:29.670 --> 24:31.970
if you give me your undivided attention.

24:32.090 --> 24:34.760
We've installed some interesting modifications.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.890
You see this arm here?

24:38.180 --> 24:42.310
Now, open the top and inside are your defence mechanism controls.

24:42.430 --> 24:44.770
Smoke screen. Oil slick.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.940
Rear bulletproof screen.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.610
And left and right front-wing machine guns.

24:49.730 --> 24:53.860
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about. You see the gear lever here?

24:53.990 --> 24:56.030
Now, if you take the top off,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.450
you'll find a little red button.

24:59.370 --> 25:02.040
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?

25:02.160 --> 25:05.040
Because you'll release this section of the roof

25:05.170 --> 25:08.040
and engage and fire the passenger ejector seat.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.550
Ejector seat? You're joking!

25:12.340 --> 25:14.380
I never joke about my work, 007.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.350
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.

25:22.470 --> 25:25.640
An old member has dropped by, sir. Same handicap as yours.

25:25.770 --> 25:28.810
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?

25:28.940 --> 25:31.150
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.440
This is Mr Goldfinger.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.450
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

25:40.950 --> 25:44.160
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

25:44.290 --> 25:47.790
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.500
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

25:51.630 --> 25:54.630
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.050
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.180
He's an admirable manservant

26:02.310 --> 26:04.480
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.770
Golf is not yet the national game of Korea.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.740
This meeting is not a coincidence.

26:25.370 --> 26:27.410
What's your game, Mr Bond?

26:31.290 --> 26:35.970
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.

26:56.610 --> 26:59.570
A 1940 smelt from the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.450
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.620
When the Nazis were on the run.

27:04.740 --> 27:07.660
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.210
Interesting.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.170
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

27:13.290 --> 27:16.550
Then you have no objection to increasing the stakes?

27:16.670 --> 27:20.760
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.770
- It's worth 5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!

27:28.890 --> 27:30.940
Naturally.

27:34.730 --> 27:36.780
Strict rules of golf?

27:37.940 --> 27:39.990
But of course.

28:12.810 --> 28:15.150
Bad luck, you're in the rough.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.910
What a pity. Here it is.

28:26.780 --> 28:30.040
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

28:30.160 --> 28:34.500
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger. Five minutes are almost up.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.630
A lost ball will cost you stroke and distance.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.770
I'm still training him as a caddy.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.070
Successfully, too.

29:01.860 --> 29:03.820
Slazenger No. 1.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.530
Good.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.950
If that's his original ball, I'm Arnold Palmer.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.870
It isn't.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.080
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.670
Why, you crafty old...!

29:18.790 --> 29:20.880
Leave it.

29:21.710 --> 29:25.300
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

29:26.050 --> 29:28.550
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.140
Like me to mark it or knock it in?

29:35.270 --> 29:37.310
Play it.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.690
- This for a half.
- That's right.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.630
One to go, that will be the clincher.

29:57.750 --> 30:00.090
Fine.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.840
Did you switch 'em, sir?

30:02.960 --> 30:06.760
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.

30:12.220 --> 30:15.060
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.880
Down in five.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.670
I have to sink this to halve the game, right?

30:50.470 --> 30:54.350
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!

30:56.430 --> 30:59.440
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

30:59.560 --> 31:03.070
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

31:03.190 --> 31:05.480
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

31:05.610 --> 31:08.700
You must have played the wrong ball on the 18th fairway.

31:08.820 --> 31:10.860
We are playing strict rules, so

31:10.990 --> 31:13.490
I'm afraid you lose the hole and the match.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.870
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

31:55.490 --> 31:58.160
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.

31:58.290 --> 32:02.960
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths have crossed. Let's leave it at that.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.460
Didn't our first meeting convince you?

32:05.590 --> 32:09.800
I see. You're worried about me not giving you a return game.

32:11.090 --> 32:14.970
Both of us know perfectly well what we're talking about, Mr Bond.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.350
But I see that it is necessary to remind you.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.520
Oddjob!

32:20.560 --> 32:24.230
Many people have tried to involve themselves in my affairs.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.400
Unsuccessfully.

32:40.120 --> 32:43.460
Remarkable. But what does the club secretary have to say?

32:43.580 --> 32:45.630
Nothing, Mr Bond.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.800
I own the club.

32:49.380 --> 32:52.130
I assume you want the cheque made out to cash.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.590
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.680
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

33:03.270 --> 33:05.940
I believe this is yours.

33:40.890 --> 33:43.350
Can I have your attention, please?

33:43.480 --> 33:47.020
British United Air Ferries announce the final call

33:47.190 --> 33:52.320
for the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

33:57.160 --> 34:03.330
British United Air Ferries announce the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.040
Mr Bond!

34:05.160 --> 34:09.000
I've got you booked on the next flight to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.170
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.080
Discipline, 007.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.880
Discipline.

37:48.430 --> 37:51.720
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.

37:51.850 --> 37:54.770
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

37:54.890 --> 37:56.940
You should've pulled over further.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.400
Look at them!

37:59.520 --> 38:02.900
A double blowout. I've never seen one of these before.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.780
- How could new tyres...?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.950
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.700
You don't look like a girl who should be ditched.

38:11.830 --> 38:14.160
Never mind that. Please take me to a garage.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.330
Certainly.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.540
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...

38:18.670 --> 38:20.710
As quickly as possible.

38:29.050 --> 38:31.180
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

38:37.850 --> 38:39.900
What's your name, by the way?

38:40.020 --> 38:42.070
Soames. Tilly Soames.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.700
Here for the hunting season?

38:46.820 --> 38:49.700
I had a case just like that one.

38:51.990 --> 38:54.250
It's for my ice skates.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.000
Lovely sport.

38:58.580 --> 39:01.710
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.050
I didn't know there was ice there this time of the year.

39:05.170 --> 39:07.510
There's a garage.

39:40.790 --> 39:44.670
They say it'll take 24 hours to get new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.300
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.470
I hate to leave you here alone.

39:50.590 --> 39:52.640
I can take care of myself.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.810
Yes, I'm sure you can.

39:54.930 --> 39:57.100
Well... don't forget to write.

41:54.260 --> 41:57.180
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.510
And art requires...

41:59.640 --> 42:04.350
In this case, the bodywork of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.560
We dismantle it here.

42:08.690 --> 42:13.610
Reduce the gold in this special furnace, which in turn...

42:13.740 --> 42:15.780
weighing approximately two tons.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.620
I make six trips a year to Europe in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.410
It would be wiser to suspend your other activities.

42:24.540 --> 42:27.170
Mr Ling, please assure your principals.

42:27.290 --> 42:31.170
Operation Grand Slam will have my undivided attention...

43:30.560 --> 43:33.520
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

43:33.650 --> 43:36.740
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!

43:36.860 --> 43:38.900
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

43:39.030 --> 43:42.620
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!

43:42.740 --> 43:44.790
TM. Tilly Masterson.

43:44.910 --> 43:47.620
I knew your sister Jill. I know what he did to her.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.790
No, you don't! Let me go!

43:49.920 --> 43:53.250
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!

43:53.380 --> 43:55.710
Well, you're a lousy shot.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.880
But somebody else around here isn't.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.010
Come on.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.730
Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

46:08.720 --> 46:11.020
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

46:20.690 --> 46:21.780
Now!

50:27.150 --> 50:29.020
Good evening, 007.

50:29.150 --> 50:31.190
My name is James Bond.

50:32.690 --> 50:36.360
And members of your curious profession are few in number.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.370
You have been recognised.

50:40.490 --> 50:44.710
Let's say by one of your opposite numbers, who is also licensed to kill.

50:44.830 --> 50:47.040
That interesting car of yours!

50:49.340 --> 50:51.380
I, too, have a new toy, but

50:51.500 --> 50:53.510
considerably more practical.

50:53.630 --> 50:56.340
You are looking at an industrial laser,

50:56.470 --> 50:59.550
which emits an extraordinary light, unknown in nature.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.100
It can project a spot on the moon.

51:03.270 --> 51:07.190
Or at closer range, cut through solid metal. I will show you.

51:35.210 --> 51:37.260
This is gold, Mr Bond.

51:38.220 --> 51:41.140
All my life, I've been in love with its colour,

51:41.260 --> 51:43.890
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

51:45.640 --> 51:49.350
I welcome any enterprise that will increase my stock,

51:50.400 --> 51:52.360
which is considerable.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.320
I think you've made your point. Thank you for the demonstration.

51:58.450 --> 52:02.450
Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr Bond. It may be your last.

52:05.240 --> 52:08.500
The purpose of our two encounters is now very clear to me.

52:08.620 --> 52:12.330
I do not intend to be distracted by another. Good night, Mr Bond.

52:15.170 --> 52:16.760
Do you expect me to talk?

52:17.920 --> 52:20.010
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!

52:21.430 --> 52:25.180
There is nothing you can talk to me about that I don't already know.

52:36.690 --> 52:38.740
You're forgetting one thing.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.320
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

52:43.370 --> 52:45.580
I trust he will be more successful.

52:49.790 --> 52:51.670
He knows what I know.

52:51.790 --> 52:54.000
You know nothing, Mr Bond.

52:55.460 --> 52:58.590
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.820
Two words you may have overheard

53:24.950 --> 53:29.830
which cannot have any significance to you or anyone in your organisation.

53:29.950 --> 53:32.120
Can you afford to take that chance?

53:47.510 --> 53:50.180
You are quite right, Mr Bond.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.350
You are worth more to me alive.

54:25.300 --> 54:27.340
Who are you?

54:27.470 --> 54:30.180
My name is Pussy Galore.

54:32.930 --> 54:34.980
I must be dreaming.

54:45.280 --> 54:47.320
I thought I'd wake up dead.

54:47.910 --> 54:49.950
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.120
I see.

54:54.460 --> 54:57.920
I'm delighted to be here.

54:59.670 --> 55:02.550
And, by the way, where is here?

55:02.670 --> 55:06.180
35,000 feet flying southwest over Newfoundland.

55:07.180 --> 55:09.220
That explains the humming.

55:09.350 --> 55:14.350
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.850
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.

55:16.980 --> 55:20.360
I never realised he enjoyed my company that much.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.070
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

55:23.190 --> 55:25.240
Mei-Lei.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.610
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?

55:28.740 --> 55:33.290
Just a drink. A martini, shaken not stirred.

55:36.410 --> 55:38.460
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

55:38.580 --> 55:40.670
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.

55:41.540 --> 55:43.590
You are?

55:43.710 --> 55:45.760
And just how personal is that?

55:47.260 --> 55:49.300
I'm a damn good pilot.

55:49.430 --> 55:50.510
Period!

55:50.640 --> 55:53.100
Well, that's good news. By the way,

55:53.220 --> 55:55.390
- where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.

55:59.310 --> 56:01.360
Thank you.

56:06.490 --> 56:09.530
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.870
This should be a memorable flight.

56:17.250 --> 56:20.920
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.

56:36.430 --> 56:38.230
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

56:38.350 --> 56:42.190
our port of entry into the United States, in 55 minutes.

56:43.190 --> 56:44.940
Mei-Lei.

56:45.070 --> 56:48.360
I would like to arrive more appropriately dressed.

56:48.490 --> 56:51.280
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

56:53.410 --> 56:55.450
And my attach? Case?

56:55.580 --> 56:59.620
Black attach? Case damaged when examined. So sorry.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.960
Apologies quite unnecessary.

57:09.340 --> 57:11.840
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei to keep an eye on him.

58:48.970 --> 58:51.270
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

58:51.390 --> 58:53.940
Do you want to play it easy... or the hard way?

58:54.060 --> 58:56.110
And this isn't a tranquilliser.

58:56.230 --> 58:59.480
Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns.

58:59.610 --> 59:01.900
That's a Smith & Wesson. 45.

59:02.030 --> 59:05.950
If you fire this close, the bullet will pass through me and the fuselage

59:06.070 --> 59:08.120
like a blowtorch through butter.

59:08.240 --> 59:12.370
The cabin will depressurise and we'll be sucked into outer space together.

59:12.500 --> 59:15.040
If that's how you want to arrive, you're welcome.

59:15.170 --> 59:17.210
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

59:17.340 --> 59:19.250
That's very sensible.

59:19.380 --> 59:22.420
And there's so much going on around Mr Goldfinger,

59:22.550 --> 59:25.680
I wouldn't dream of not accepting his... hospitality.

59:26.340 --> 59:28.390
He'll be very glad to see you, too.

59:28.510 --> 59:30.970
You like close shaves, don't you?

59:36.560 --> 59:39.230
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.

59:40.980 --> 59:43.150
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

59:43.280 --> 59:46.030
It's about 007, sir. We picked up his homer signal

59:46.160 --> 59:49.740
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore, where he's just landed.

59:49.870 --> 59:52.080
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.250
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

59:54.370 --> 59:56.420
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.

59:56.540 --> 59:59.210
Registered to our old friend Auric Goldfinger.

59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.960
I'm glad he's making progress. Keep an eye on him for us.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.260
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky, is their final destination.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.050
Don't charge in on him and spoil anything, will you?

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.350
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.790
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:39.210
Any time.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.500
Thank you.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.980
Do mind your step, Captain.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.140
Just keep playing it easy.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.690
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's all right with Mr Goldfinger?

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.070
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.010
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.850
Come on.

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.010
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:38.180
I believe the bourbon and branch water is rather splendid here in Kentucky.

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:41.600
Well, now that we're both off duty, perhaps...

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:49.400
Manners, Oddjob.

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:52.530
I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:58.000
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.170
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.470
Your final briefing is tonight. That'll be all for now.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.750
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:25.920
Lovely animal, isn't she?

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.550
Certainly better bred than the owner.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.130
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.200
Felix!

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.660
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.710
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.710
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:05.680
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole in his shoes.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.730
Yeah, I like this!

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:17.650
Gentlemen!

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.370
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York and the West Coast were in on this?

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:22.700
Look who's talking!

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.160
I do not do business with Chicago.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:28.120
I thought we had a private business deal to settle.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.880
Now I find I'm attending a hoods' convention.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.250
Goldfinger, I made a delivery. Where is my money?

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.260
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.720
And you owe me one million bucks.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.640
I owe each of you a million

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.810
in gold bullion.

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:47.980
So, pay!

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.730
Gentlemen, you can have the million today.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:56.320
Or ten millions tomorrow.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.610
Did you say ten million?

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.360
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.490
Banks don't open on Sunday.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.700
My bank will.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.040
What's with that trick pool table?

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:28.350
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:30.520
Turn those lights back on!

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.980
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.520
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.660
I don't like being cooped up like this. What's that map doing there?

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.460
This is my bank.

01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:01.090
The gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.720
In its vaults are $15 billion.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.390
The entire gold supply

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.520
of the United States.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.440
Knock off Fort Knox!

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:18.270
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.950
There are 35,000 troops stationed around there!

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:24.110
41,000.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.700
And who's gonna say boo to them, Goldfinger?

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.700
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:33.160
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:55.770
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.270
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.440
He has fired rockets to the moon.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.610
Split the atom.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.660
Achieved miracles

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.160
in every field of human endeavour... except crime!

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.790
The underworld will applaud for centuries!

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:20.080
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:22.830
It's pointless. The depository's impregnable.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.710
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.550
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.680
Larger, better protected perhaps, but nonetheless a bank!

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.390
It can be... I think the expression is

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.100
blown.

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.060
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:45.440
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:48.320
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:52.110
Every detail has been scrupulously prepared.

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:54.950
Every eventuality has been considered.

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:57.490
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.660
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:03.500
brought a batch of these canisters across the Canadian border.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.090
They contain Delta 9.

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:09.510
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas

01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:16.100
which disperses 15 minutes after inducing complete... unconsciousness

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.260
for 24 hours.

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.940
Tomorrow at dawn,

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.730
the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore,

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.190
will spray it into the atmosphere.

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:35.490
Once the population, including the military, has been immobilised

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:38.410
my task force, which Mr Strap and his people

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.540
smuggled across the Rio Grande from Mexico,

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.710
will approach Fort Knox in motorised equipment

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:49.750
along Bullion Boulevard, which runs past the depository here

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.090
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:56.890
This fence surrounding the depository,

01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:00.560
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.730
It will be dynamited!

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:06.230
My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:08.400
How, may I ask?

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.110
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By using your influence in shipping circles

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.660
to bring through customs uninspected

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.830
a consignment labelled machine parts.

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:23.790
All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.960
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.420
If you have no objection... I'll take my money now.

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.170
What's the matter, Solo? Too big for you to handle?

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.180
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:47.480
Excuse me for a moment while I take care of him. Make yourselves comfortable.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.140
Pussy!

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.390
Who taught you judo?

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.730
The gun you took.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.860
The gun.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.860
The gun, of course.

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:47.960
We must have a few fast falls together some time.

01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.390
Hey, Strap! He's got the right answers.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.310
You and me don't even have to be there. The boys can handle everything.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.950
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.030
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:32.250
The gas!

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:59.990
Such a pity you did not choose to remain with the others, Mr Solo. However...

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:08.240
Mr Bond, I thought you were resting in your quarters.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:12.170
They are delightful. But it's much too nice to stay indoors.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:15.960
I ran into Miss Galore and she suggested that we join you.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.420
Mr Solo, Mr Bond. Another of my distinguished guests.

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:21.590
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.390
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:29.060
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.770
My plane will get you to New York on time

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:34.350
with your excess luggage.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.400
Allow me.

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:42.650
My chauffeur's an excellent driver. You will be at the airport in a few minutes.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.320
Goodbye, Mr Solo. Some other time, perhaps?

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:47.490
Happy landings, old boy.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.710
I found him under the model.

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.210
Operation Grand Slam. I did enjoy your briefing.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.350
So did I.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.780
He's on the move.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.390
Slow down, don't crowd him.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.580
Are you blind or something? You missed the turn!

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:46.190
They've turned to the right just ahead here somewhere.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.050
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:06.550
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.930
Dead.

01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:20.180
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:22.350
Why would he do that?

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.690
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.580
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will make you a very rich woman, my dear.

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:51.090
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.720
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.840
No, I've spotted a little island in the Bahamas.

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:01.350
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",

01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.520
and go back to nature.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.110
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:12.530
Touts looking for racing tips.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:19.070
There's another possibility, however.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.240
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.

01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:24.450
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life in Switzerland,

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.710
if those gentlemen are his friends.

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:29.670
Let's convince them he needs no assistance.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.920
For their benefit, Pussy, let's make him as happy as possible.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.050
I suggest you change into something more suitable.

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:41.550
Certainly.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.350
Business before pleasure.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.240
He wants you.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.550
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.720
Mint julep?

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.550
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.060
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.140
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:31.100
You know Operation Grand Slam simply won't work.

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:34.360
And incidentally Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.150
You are unusually well informed, Mr Bond.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.740
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.280
Ha! American motorists kill that many every two years.

01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:47.870
Yes, well... I've worked out a few statistics of my own.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.040
$15 billion

01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:53.790
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.090
60 men would take 12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.260
At the most, you'll have two hours

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:05.680
before the army, navy, air force, marines move in and make you put it back.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.100
Who mentioned anything about removing it?

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.400
Is the julep tart enough for you?

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.530
You plan to break into the world's largest bank

01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:21.950
but not to steal anything.

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:23.910
Why?

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:25.620
Go on, Mr Bond.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:28.750
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent at the factory?

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:32.040
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.170
But of course! His government's given you a bomb.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.760
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.300
It's small but particularly dirty.

01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:46.300
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:49.180
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the...

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.020
entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for...

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:57.190
57 years.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.110
58, to be exact.

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.780
I apologise, Goldfinger. It's an inspired deal.

01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:06.990
They get what they want - economic chaos in the West.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.040
And the value of your gold increases many times.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.750
I conservatively estimate... ten times.

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:15.920
Brilliant.

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:20.630
But the atomic device, as you call it,

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.050
is already, obviously, in this country.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.800
Obviously.

01:24:26.930 --> 01:24:30.640
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:32.770
could be risky. Very risky.

01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:35.690
On the contrary, Mr Bond. The risk is all on your side.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:38.900
If the authorities should attempt to locate it,

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.530
who knows where it might be exploded?

01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:44.860
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London,

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.660
Cape Kennedy,

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.700
near the White House.

01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:53.960
But we are speculating idly. Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.210
You will be there to see for yourself.

01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:58.420
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:12.100
Forgive me, Mr Bond,

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.520
but I must arrange to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:19.440
As you said, he had a pressing engagement.

01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:21.860
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.570
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.740
I'll join you both later.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.290
How about it, handsome?

01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:38.670
Don't you think it's time we got to know each other socially?

01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:40.840
The new Miss Galore.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.760
Where do you hide your gold knuckles in this outfit?

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.840
I never carry weapons after business hours.

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.010
Yeah? So you're off duty?

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.800
I'm completely defenceless.

01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.810
So am I.

01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:03.110
That's my James!

01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:05.650
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.070
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.410
Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning.

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.620
He's quite mad, you know.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.960
Well, now. What do we have here?

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.670
007 seems to have the situation well in hand.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.800
Come on, I'm bushed. Let's get back to the motel.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.260
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:34.890
I'd like to think you're not in all of this... caper.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.140
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:41.350
What would it take for you to see things my way?

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.820
A lot more than you've got.

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.690
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:53.240
Isn't it customary to grant a condemned man his last request?

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:55.410
You've asked for this.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.090
Get up!

01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:08.170
Certainly.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.980
Now let's both play.

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.100
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.770
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!

01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:25.420
Speed: 220.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.040
Wind check: Westerly.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.100
Champagne leader to Champagne section. Commence dive... now.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.280
Ready for Rockabye Baby.

01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:57.370
Commence spray on countdown.

01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:58.870
Five,

01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:02.200
four, three, two,

01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:03.410
zero.

01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:50.600
Champagne leader to Grand Slam task force leader.

01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.730
The baby is asleep.

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.480
I repeat, the baby is asleep. We're going home now.

01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:58.650
Out.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.840
Good morning, Mr Bond.

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.510
For once, you are exactly where I want you.

01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:40.750
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.

01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:44.210
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:47.960
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:52.050
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

01:36:52.170 --> 01:36:54.550
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.

01:37:29.130 --> 01:37:31.550
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.460
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...

01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:42.580
He's one of them, so is the girl.

01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.740
I'll get her, you get the door open.

01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.090
We're trapped!

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.220
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.

01:39:03.970 --> 01:39:06.020
Don't be a fool!

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.180
You can be a hero, I'm not!

01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:13.360
No, no!

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:36.640
Keep going! Hurry up!

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.830
What kept you?

01:44:58.950 --> 01:45:01.200
You OK, James? Where's your butler friend?

01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:03.370
He blew a fuse.

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:07.750
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger would've hit the jackpot.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.420
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:13.680
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.470
By the way, what made her call Washington?

01:45:18.970 --> 01:45:21.930
I must have appealed to her maternal instincts.

01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:30.980
Come on, James. Get aboard. You can't keep the President waiting.

01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:35.660
Special plane, lunch at the White House. How come?

01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.240
The President wants to thank you personally.

01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:41.790
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.960
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.170
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.920
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.260
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:54.420
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.420
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:32.380
Well, congratulations on your promotion, Goldfinger.

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:37.550
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.390
You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Mr Bond.

01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:46.600
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes. I even had to warn Pussy about it.

01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:51.020
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:53.730
She is where she ought to be... at the controls.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.530
Pussy!

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.330
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.790
It's no good.

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.120
Oh, no, you don't!

01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:31.500
This is no time to be rescued.
