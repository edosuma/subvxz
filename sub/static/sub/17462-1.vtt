01:18.166 --> 01:19.567
- Hey, there, man.
- How you doin'?

01:19.667 --> 01:22.370
- Good.
- Good man.

01:23.171 --> 01:26.341
- Hey, Kyle.
- What's up, man?

01:28.343 --> 01:31.279
Hey, Kyle. You look sharp.

02:13.421 --> 02:16.490
Who goes to a party
to listen to their own music?

02:18.961 --> 02:20.788
Sorry?

02:21.563 --> 02:25.458
I said, who comes to a party
to listen to their own music?

02:25.933 --> 02:28.537
I think my music is better.

02:30.072 --> 02:31.273
You know, you, er...

02:31.373 --> 02:34.910
You keep knocking back the vodka like that,
you won't be able to hear a thing.

02:35.010 --> 02:39.040
Trust me,
I can't get wasted enough tonight.

02:43.085 --> 02:46.146
Why don't I help you along with that?

02:46.621 --> 02:50.993
So, this is my last weekend
of freedom for, like, three months.

02:51.093 --> 02:52.987
Really?

02:54.062 --> 02:58.993
- Why's that?
- Mm... my mother is punishing me.

03:00.068 --> 03:02.271
For what?

03:04.372 --> 03:06.904
For stabbing my stepfather.

03:08.676 --> 03:10.879
Yeah, right.

03:23.691 --> 03:26.128
What the fuck?

03:26.228 --> 03:28.689
You're way too easy.

03:29.064 --> 03:32.284
Who says that? You're fucking crazy.

03:33.701 --> 03:37.497
Sorry to disappoint, but...
I'm actually pretty sane.

03:37.772 --> 03:41.576
Unlike my mother, who went and married
the first random stranger she met

03:41.676 --> 03:45.363
after my father passed away,
and put him in charge.

03:47.449 --> 03:49.526
Anyway...

03:58.493 --> 04:01.106
I'm Amy, by the way.

04:02.064 --> 04:05.200
Amy... well, I'm Kyle.

04:07.102 --> 04:09.304
Kyle Hartmann.

04:11.789 --> 04:13.802
Wanna get out of here?

04:15.243 --> 04:17.112
Sure.

05:51.306 --> 05:53.475
Hey... where are you?

05:53.575 --> 05:55.477
<i>About to head to Nassau juvie.</i>

05:55.577 --> 05:57.645
Don't worry.
I've taken care of everything.

05:57.745 --> 06:00.348
Cost you a hundred grand,
but the DUI never happened.

06:00.448 --> 06:04.119
- What about the girl?
- <i>Blood test says she was higher than ever.</i>

06:04.219 --> 06:07.506
Her parents don't want the publicity
any more than we do. She'll be fine.

06:07.606 --> 06:09.957
Bruised but not broken.

06:10.057 --> 06:12.653
Never have kids, Marcos.

06:13.228 --> 06:15.930
Listen, the S.E.C. meeting's
been pushed till noon.

06:16.030 --> 06:18.300
They want to go over the merger
detail one more time.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.769
Let 'em. They won't find anything
they didn't find the last four times.

06:21.869 --> 06:27.156
Don't worry. It'll be approved. All you need
to do is close the finance with Westcom.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.778
I appreciate you taking care of this.

06:30.878 --> 06:33.048
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

06:33.148 --> 06:36.951
You focus on closing that deal.
I've got Kyle under control.

06:52.534 --> 06:55.754
What took you so long?
We thought you needed a time-out.

06:55.854 --> 06:57.205
Seven fucking days...

06:57.305 --> 06:59.907
Have you seen the people in this place?
You know what could've happened to me?

07:00.007 --> 07:03.478
You're lucky I know the judge, or we would've
had plenty of time to see how that played out.

07:03.578 --> 07:06.348
Where's my dad?
- - Up to here.

07:06.448 --> 07:10.418
It was an accident, alright? Jesus.
A dog ran out.

07:10.518 --> 07:13.521
Blood alcohol says you saw
three dogs and a pink elephant.

07:13.621 --> 07:16.058
Where's my phone?

07:16.158 --> 07:19.627
- You don't need it where you're going.
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:19.727 --> 07:23.765
It means your father is sick
and tired of cleaning up after you.

07:23.865 --> 07:25.120
He's giving you one last chance.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.703
You screw this up, he is cutting you
off forever. Legally disowning you.

07:28.803 --> 07:30.672
That's bullshit.

07:30.772 --> 07:35.530
I got the papers all drawn up.
You wanna see? Hey. You want him?

07:36.010 --> 07:37.837
Yeah.

07:44.652 --> 07:46.236
Hello.

07:46.336 --> 07:48.915
Did you really leave
that girl there to die?

07:50.858 --> 07:53.228
It wasn't like that.

07:53.328 --> 07:55.963
So, you're a coward now?

07:56.063 --> 08:01.336
- Dad, I can... I can explain.
- I'm done listening to your explanations.

08:01.436 --> 08:05.673
You do whatever Marcos tells you
or you're out on your own.

08:05.773 --> 08:10.561
- I'll just go and stay with mom.
- <i>Your mother's alimony runs out next year.</i>

08:11.446 --> 08:15.550
Do you really think
she can support your lifestyle?

08:15.650 --> 08:20.204
This is your last
of a million last chances, Kyle.

08:21.523 --> 08:23.826
Don't waste it.

08:24.926 --> 08:26.778
Dad...

08:33.400 --> 08:35.437
Was this his idea or yours?

08:35.537 --> 08:38.355
Let's just say it was a meeting of minds.

08:38.923 --> 08:41.458
You know what you are, Marcos?
You're a lapdog.

08:41.558 --> 08:44.166
Someone to do his bidding, and when he's
done with you, he'll throw your ass out

08:44.265 --> 08:46.230
like he does with everyone
he's finished with.

08:46.330 --> 08:50.502
This is very simple, Kyle.
Get in the car or go back to jail.

08:50.602 --> 08:53.070
The choice is yours.

08:53.170 --> 08:55.891
Makes no difference to me either way.

10:12.617 --> 10:15.621
Welcome to West Soay, Mr. Hartmann.

10:16.521 --> 10:18.723
I'm Mr. Close. Course principal.

10:18.823 --> 10:22.856
This is Mr. Maxwell.
Outdoor survival instructor.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.947
I don't need your instructions.
I can take care of myself.

10:27.899 --> 10:29.634
Where you come from, maybe that's true,

10:29.734 --> 10:32.837
but out here, with that attitude,
you could probably end up dead.

10:32.937 --> 10:35.339
You're in a different world now, Hartmann.

10:35.439 --> 10:38.977
There will be consequences
for every choice you make.

10:39.677 --> 10:42.781
Rule one, no lying.

10:43.581 --> 10:46.451
Rule two, respect
for fellow students and faculty.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.920
Rule three, no sex.

10:49.020 --> 10:54.325
Rule four, no fighting. Rule five,
absolute punctuality at all times.

10:54.425 --> 10:58.496
I repeat rule three, no sex.

10:59.146 --> 11:01.148
The course you're about
to begin, Mr. Hartmann,

11:01.248 --> 11:04.118
has been designed to give people like you,

11:04.268 --> 11:07.939
the spoiled, overprivileged
offspring of the super-rich,

11:08.039 --> 11:11.676
one last chance to make
something of themselves.

11:11.776 --> 11:14.979
Now, this island will be your home
for the next three months.

11:15.079 --> 11:19.634
I would suggest you follow its rules
and regulations without question.

11:19.734 --> 11:22.386
Or suffer its punishments.

11:30.462 --> 11:36.116
Mr. Herrick... I'm assigning Mr. Hartmann
to you, here, for orientation.

11:37.534 --> 11:40.054
Make sure he knows the drill.

11:41.873 --> 11:45.877
So, what's with all the security guards?
Is this a pow camp or what?

11:45.977 --> 11:49.146
Use your head, man. We're rich kids...

11:49.246 --> 11:52.917
valuable assets,
we're... human bearer bonds.

11:53.017 --> 11:55.252
There are other issues here too. Like...

11:55.352 --> 11:57.822
running off, getting lost in the woods.

11:57.922 --> 12:01.493
If you want a hot shower,
you split your own wood for the stove.

12:01.593 --> 12:04.161
Here. Why don't you give it a go?

12:04.261 --> 12:06.160
Looks like you could use one.

12:07.131 --> 12:10.167
No. You seem to be getting
a good kick out of it.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.837
I'll let you have all the fun.

12:12.937 --> 12:16.674
Listen, "entitled brat" doesn't work here.

12:16.774 --> 12:20.828
You pull your own weight
or we all pay the consequences.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.872
Here you go.

12:42.399 --> 12:45.903
Alright. That's you. That's me.

12:46.003 --> 12:50.508
- Wait. We're sharing this room?
- Yeah. Lucky me, right?

12:50.608 --> 12:53.060
So, what was your crime?

12:54.712 --> 12:59.333
Gambling. I took a hit
that almost bankrupt my folks.

13:00.885 --> 13:04.889
Dinner's at seven.
They don't like it when you're late.

13:05.489 --> 13:07.741
Good for them.

13:17.969 --> 13:19.821
Fuck.

14:06.383 --> 14:09.787
Looking a little green around the gills,
there, Sergeant Dorsey.

14:09.887 --> 14:13.591
These three years in the glasshouse
have softened you up.

14:13.691 --> 14:17.929
Last I remember, you were the one puking
your guts overboard in the Persian Gulf...

14:18.029 --> 14:20.881
- ...sir.
- How are you?

14:26.170 --> 14:28.405
Who's the girl?

14:28.505 --> 14:32.176
Rachel Hennie.
She's handling systems and comms.

14:32.376 --> 14:35.058
Stig Hennie's daughter. Are you serious?

14:35.158 --> 14:39.050
Trust me... she's a natural.

14:39.150 --> 14:43.688
When it comes to the tough stuff,
she takes it in her stride.

14:43.788 --> 14:46.691
Just a bunch of kids, right?
Sure you wanna go down that route?

14:46.791 --> 14:49.260
Do whatever allows us to walk away clean.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.364
It's business as usual, mate. I didn't
find God while you were doing time.

14:53.464 --> 14:55.370
I'm glad to hear it.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.970
So, who's paying for all this, then?

14:59.070 --> 15:02.223
Let's just say someone with lots to lose.

15:08.012 --> 15:10.431
When do we move?

15:11.716 --> 15:13.601
When I get the call.

15:20.124 --> 15:23.427
Rule five, Mr. Hartmann.

15:23.527 --> 15:26.530
It's now 15 minutes after seven.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.716
Sorry, I... fell asleep.

15:30.467 --> 15:34.654
- I'm still on U.S. time.
- You're so full of shit.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.959
Miss Tilton, please.

15:40.444 --> 15:44.298
A little exercise should help
with that jetlag, Hartmann.

15:45.216 --> 15:47.122
Are you serious?

15:48.552 --> 15:51.956
None of your classmates
eat until you're done.

15:52.056 --> 15:53.908
Outside.

15:55.259 --> 15:56.611
Outside!

16:11.042 --> 16:15.446
Right. Three reps, up and back.
Double time.

16:19.917 --> 16:21.819
Ah-ah-ah...

16:21.919 --> 16:24.313
one on each shoulder.

16:30.327 --> 16:32.396
Off you pop.

16:32.496 --> 16:34.749
Move it!

16:40.404 --> 16:43.656
Come on, Hartmann. Get a move on.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.601
And again.

16:54.418 --> 16:57.037
Come on, you can do it.

17:06.730 --> 17:08.599
Good.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.804
Now you can take those ropes to
the storeroom next to the main building.

17:12.904 --> 17:16.007
The sooner you're done,
the sooner we dine.

17:16.707 --> 17:19.593
First impressions last, Mr. Hartmann.

17:47.404 --> 17:49.256
Right.

17:49.806 --> 17:52.309
Now that's over with...

17:52.409 --> 17:55.128
Introductions, please.

17:58.249 --> 18:02.386
I am James Thornton. Lexington, Kentucky.

18:02.486 --> 18:05.289
Keiko Oshimoto. Tokyo, Japan.

18:05.389 --> 18:08.559
Paloma Nava. Sao Paolo, Brazil.

18:08.659 --> 18:11.628
Amy Tilton, Boston.

18:11.728 --> 18:14.265
And the Hamptons,
where I was recently left for dead

18:14.365 --> 18:17.134
by this cowardly piece of shit
who ran away.

18:17.234 --> 18:21.338
I didn't run away.
I... I was out of it, okay?

18:21.838 --> 18:25.642
- I hit my head. I...
- You left me. That's what happened.

18:25.742 --> 18:28.912
That is not a good look, mate.
Leaving a damsel in distress

18:29.012 --> 18:32.599
- ...while you take off like road runner.
- What do you know about me?

18:32.699 --> 18:34.819
Oh, man. Relax.

18:34.919 --> 18:38.790
I'm just messing with you.
I'm... I'm sure you had your reasons.

18:38.890 --> 18:42.356
Yeah. Like being a fucking pussy.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.199
Alright, enough!

18:48.232 --> 18:50.684
All of you.

18:54.138 --> 18:56.841
I have a question for you.

18:56.941 --> 19:00.044
What... common thread
do you think you all share?

19:00.144 --> 19:03.014
I have nothing in common
with these people.

19:03.114 --> 19:05.316
My threads are made of silk.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.979
It doesn't matter what your panties
are made of, Your highness.

19:08.079 --> 19:12.256
You're all spoiled. Emotionally neglected.

19:12.356 --> 19:17.829
Seeking mindless stimulation through
technology, booze, drugs, sex, cars, cash.

19:17.929 --> 19:21.833
You will only discover who you really are
if we take those things away.

19:21.933 --> 19:26.338
But what... what if this is
who we really are? I mean...

19:27.038 --> 19:30.041
Is this what you choose, Thornton?

19:30.141 --> 19:33.251
To be the kind of man that drives his car
through the front window of a Starbucks

19:33.351 --> 19:36.981
and puts an innocent child in hospital
'cause you're too busy texting

19:37.081 --> 19:41.248
to watch where you're going.
Is that what's going to define who you are?

19:47.524 --> 19:50.176
The kid was... he was fine.

19:52.964 --> 19:57.668
You're all here for the same reason.
You're screwed up.

19:57.768 --> 20:00.404
But.. there's hope.

20:00.504 --> 20:04.441
Somewhere in your D.N.A.
is an instinct to survive

20:04.541 --> 20:07.678
and your time here is all about
unearthing that instinct.

20:07.778 --> 20:11.305
Uncovering who you really are
and helping you forge real connections

20:11.405 --> 20:13.700
to the world around you and each other.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.221
You will learn to respect yourselves
and each other.

20:17.321 --> 20:20.757
You will learn to take responsibility
for your own actions.

20:20.857 --> 20:23.811
We're giving you the opportunity to reset.

20:24.895 --> 20:27.331
To start again.

20:27.431 --> 20:32.186
And if you don't keep up,
you will be left behind.

20:34.705 --> 20:39.944
Now. Since this is the last kitchen-cooked
meal that you're gonna have for a week,

20:40.044 --> 20:42.096
eat up.

20:58.462 --> 21:01.565
As long as we continue
to support our emerging artists,

21:01.665 --> 21:04.368
institutions like this
blossom and expand...

21:04.468 --> 21:09.306
Excuse me, Mr. Hartmann.
Joe Franz, "Metro News Journal".

21:09.406 --> 21:10.792
Who let you in?

21:10.892 --> 21:15.079
Northern Core is about to become Hartmann
Global Holdings. That's a big story.

21:15.979 --> 21:18.250
Excuse me just a minute.

21:19.450 --> 21:20.662
I'm curious.

21:20.762 --> 21:24.688
How does a small-time hack like yourself
come across such privileged information?

21:24.788 --> 21:27.258
I have my sources.
And right now they're telling me

21:27.358 --> 21:30.879
the future C.E.O. of Hartmann
Global Holdings just bribed a judge,

21:30.979 --> 21:33.464
to keep his son out of jail.

21:33.564 --> 21:36.283
Careful. There might be no truth to that.

21:36.383 --> 21:39.403
Your share prices go to hell
even on a rumor like that.

21:39.503 --> 21:42.106
Maybe even the entire merger,
if people start digging.

21:42.206 --> 21:46.678
I heard talk that if this thing
falls down, you fall, too.

21:47.478 --> 21:51.315
You may have managed to find
one of my secrets, Mr. Franz...

21:52.015 --> 21:54.251
but rest assured, you do this,

21:54.351 --> 21:57.804
and I'll make it my life's mission
to find all of yours.

21:58.822 --> 22:02.293
I have dozens of litigation lawyers
and private investigators

22:02.393 --> 22:05.429
just waiting to take your pathetic life

22:05.529 --> 22:08.515
and crush it beyond all recognition.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.935
Now run along.

23:03.654 --> 23:06.206
You won't get far.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.693
It's a nice morning for escape,
Mr. Hartmann.

24:00.711 --> 24:03.013
It's not a swim I'd try, though.

24:03.113 --> 24:06.217
My name's Croft. Head of security.

24:06.617 --> 24:10.521
This island is 60 miles
from the nearest landfall.

24:11.121 --> 24:14.474
The north Atlantic's a far cry
from Sag Harbor.

24:16.327 --> 24:18.795
I got my own money.

24:19.195 --> 24:20.831
I could pay you to get me out of here.

24:20.931 --> 24:23.683
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.953
I think I'll politely decline that offer.

24:27.538 --> 24:29.673
Now, you get yourself back to bed, son,

24:29.773 --> 24:32.926
and I have no reason
to tell anyone about this.

24:46.723 --> 24:49.493
We'll stage from here, then use
an inflatable to make the landing,

24:49.593 --> 24:52.463
- and climb from there.
- Gonna run into any weather?

24:52.563 --> 24:56.933
Well, shipping forecast shows
an Atlantic swell in 72 hours.

24:57.033 --> 24:59.636
We'll be halfway to Norway by then.

25:00.036 --> 25:01.104
Who else we got?

25:01.204 --> 25:04.441
Couple of ex-marines I worked with,
after you got sent down.

25:04.541 --> 25:07.594
Good men. Work hard.

25:09.313 --> 25:11.515
They've got seven pro guards up there.

25:11.615 --> 25:15.136
It's a bit of work in the dark,
but nothing we can't handle.

25:16.252 --> 25:17.854
This is the one.

25:17.954 --> 25:21.955
We get this done, then we can say
goodbye to working for hire.

25:22.175 --> 25:25.962
Yeah, right. You'll never quit.
You love the heat too much.

25:29.466 --> 25:30.801
It's arranged.

25:30.901 --> 25:34.955
Once the account is routed through
the proxy, the funds will be untraceable.

25:37.558 --> 25:40.010
Told you she's the best.

25:40.644 --> 25:42.779
What's up?

25:42.879 --> 25:45.198
Cat got your tongue?

25:47.318 --> 25:50.221
- What's that?
- It's a database.

25:50.321 --> 25:53.507
It tells you all you need to know
about the little fuckheads up there.

25:53.607 --> 25:57.428
- Where do these people get their money?
- Their fathers steal it...

25:57.528 --> 26:00.180
then they call it free enterprise.

26:00.764 --> 26:05.161
- They never work a day in their lives.
- Rich pricks.

26:05.836 --> 26:10.923
Well, you can let me know what a rich prick
feels like, when you're one, too.

26:12.275 --> 26:14.177
What's the split?

26:14.277 --> 26:16.913
- Ten percent.
- Of what?

26:17.013 --> 26:18.699
One billion dollars.

26:20.216 --> 26:24.131
Think "a thousand million".

26:25.689 --> 26:28.542
If you can't get your head
around a billion.

26:30.394 --> 26:33.848
Biggest fucking ransom
in the history of the world, my friend.

26:38.402 --> 26:41.155
All right, you're gonna be
outdoors for at least a week,

26:41.255 --> 26:44.340
so choose what you think
you need to survive.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.578
I am not wearing another man's boots.

26:47.678 --> 26:50.947
Go barefoot. That's your choice.

26:51.047 --> 26:54.451
Now would be a very good time to start
thinking about cause and effect.

26:54.551 --> 26:58.805
You choose badly,
you live with the repercussions.

26:59.523 --> 27:01.407
Right.

27:02.526 --> 27:07.864
"Edible flora and fauna of the British
Isles". This is riveting stuff.

27:07.964 --> 27:11.334
Now, familiarize yourselves
with food you can forage.

27:11.434 --> 27:13.537
There's no packed lunches here.

27:13.637 --> 27:16.272
You will eat what you can gather,

27:16.372 --> 27:19.242
trap or kill.

27:19.342 --> 27:21.578
Once your basic supplies
run out, of course.

27:21.678 --> 27:24.916
Uh... I'm not killing anything.

27:25.416 --> 27:28.218
Cause and effect, Miss Tilton.

27:28.318 --> 27:32.700
You're always welcome to go hungry
while the rest of your fellow students eat.

27:39.596 --> 27:42.115
Oh, sweet.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.836
Hey, Herrick. You're a gambler, right?

27:45.936 --> 27:48.138
Depends who's asking.

27:48.238 --> 27:50.140
You wanna bet who's gonna
break rule three first?

27:50.240 --> 27:53.009
You know what I bet?

27:53.109 --> 27:56.362
I bet that mouth of yours
gets you in trouble one day.

28:02.553 --> 28:06.590
Oh, Thornton. It already has, mate.

28:06.890 --> 28:09.342
Why do you think I'm here?

28:11.928 --> 28:14.180
Take it easy.

28:14.865 --> 28:17.100
Hey, Kyle.

28:17.300 --> 28:21.922
You oughta grab hold of one of these,
just... since you decided to stay.

29:06.382 --> 29:10.253
My father did not send me here
to be a beast of burden.

29:10.353 --> 29:12.288
Why did he send you here, then, Fayed?

29:12.388 --> 29:15.741
Other than to bore us all
with your royal bullshit.

29:16.426 --> 29:19.179
You know, I feel sorry for you, Marsac.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.616
- Oh?
- Growing up without any parents.

29:22.966 --> 29:26.003
No one to teach you
to respect your superiors.

29:26.803 --> 29:30.774
That's a lesson you must've missed.
I'll teach you now, shall I mate, uh?

29:30.874 --> 29:33.343
That's enough.

29:33.443 --> 29:36.450
Rule number four, no fighting.

29:38.882 --> 29:41.266
Let's get started.

29:49.625 --> 29:53.464
Alright. Mr. Herrick.
Let's have you on, please.

29:53.564 --> 29:56.649
- Go, Herrick.
- Hell, yeah.

29:56.933 --> 29:59.235
Ready for some magic.

29:59.335 --> 30:01.939
Nothing like added bounce.

30:02.739 --> 30:04.775
Alright, ladies.

30:04.875 --> 30:08.111
Go in together, strength in numbers.
Here we go, please.

30:08.211 --> 30:10.681
Nice and easy.

30:10.881 --> 30:13.667
Nice bit of synchronized footwork.

30:17.854 --> 30:21.558
- Miss Tilton.
- Just be careful, all right?

30:21.958 --> 30:24.360
Okay, let's see it. Come on.

30:24.460 --> 30:27.268
Years of ballet training.

30:28.648 --> 30:30.823
Very nimble.

30:33.069 --> 30:36.340
- Show us what you got.
- Oh, I will.

30:37.140 --> 30:40.093
I'll show you boys how it's really done.

30:42.713 --> 30:44.014
Well, that's something.

30:44.114 --> 30:47.183
Yeah, lovely. Very nice.

30:49.152 --> 30:51.188
Copied me, obviously.

30:52.388 --> 30:54.725
Alright, who have we got next?

30:54.825 --> 30:57.994
Mr. Hartmann. Looking a bit pale.

30:58.094 --> 31:02.753
- Hey, Marsac. Four to one he bottles it.
- Yeah, alright, I'll take that.

31:04.835 --> 31:08.147
You're doing great, Hartmann.
Nice and calm.

31:08.247 --> 31:10.006
Looks like he has jelly legs.

31:10.106 --> 31:14.595
Nothing like pure, unadulterated fear
to snap you into focus, right, Hartmann?

31:18.749 --> 31:20.483
I'm coming after you, alright?

31:20.583 --> 31:21.717
- No.
- No, come on.

31:21.817 --> 31:24.287
- No, no, no, no. Please.
- It's alright, Mr. Hartmann.

31:24.387 --> 31:27.924
- Nice and easy, Thornton.
- Oh...

31:28.024 --> 31:30.543
That's not easy, Thornton.

31:30.643 --> 31:35.231
Thornton, enough. That's enough.
Come on, boy. Get it under control.

31:35.331 --> 31:36.934
Thornton.

31:37.034 --> 31:40.486
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm trying to do it. Just go!

31:41.672 --> 31:44.874
Thornton, stay still.
Hartmann, just come on your own.

31:46.642 --> 31:48.979
Play nice, huh?

31:49.079 --> 31:52.499
- Come on. She's waiting for you.
- Fuck off, Marsac.

31:52.599 --> 31:55.619
You did fine, Hartmann.
Come on. Good work. Well done.

31:55.719 --> 31:57.854
That's it. Good work.

31:57.954 --> 32:00.306
Okay. I got it.

32:04.194 --> 32:07.647
You're laughing too much.
Let's see how you do.

32:08.631 --> 32:10.983
Come on, class clown.

32:11.467 --> 32:15.188
- Alright.
- Okay, Mr. Marsac.

32:15.972 --> 32:17.874
Here we go.

32:17.974 --> 32:20.276
That's lovely work.

32:20.376 --> 32:23.013
Alright, boys. You're doing fine.

32:23.113 --> 32:24.982
Right.

32:25.882 --> 32:29.068
You have to think like your prey.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.587
You get to know the animal,

32:31.687 --> 32:35.258
its tracks, paths, and routes...

32:35.358 --> 32:37.361
and that...

32:37.861 --> 32:40.130
is where you set the snare.

32:40.230 --> 32:44.868
One bunny, split nine ways,
is more of a snack than a meal.

32:44.968 --> 32:47.319
Is it even worth it?

32:54.811 --> 32:58.414
There isn't an animal in the wilderness
that can't be caught.

32:58.714 --> 33:00.483
Big or small.

33:00.583 --> 33:04.511
You just have to set the right trap,
in the right place.

33:04.921 --> 33:08.641
Bend your elbow a little
and then stretch up.

33:11.327 --> 33:16.199
Hartmann. Come on, rise and shine, buddy.
We got a big day ahead.

33:16.299 --> 33:20.353
What's your problem, Herrick.
You got nothing better to do?

33:22.105 --> 33:24.357
Come here.

33:26.642 --> 33:28.979
You're a real asshole, you know that?

33:29.079 --> 33:32.482
Look around, buddy. I was doing you
a favor. Everybody else is up.

33:32.582 --> 33:34.918
Remember what happened
last time you were late?

33:35.068 --> 33:36.399
Dick.

33:43.259 --> 33:44.695
Hartmann...

33:44.795 --> 33:47.063
- I'm letting go the safety...
- No, no, no!

33:47.163 --> 33:50.934
- ...so you can free-climb up like the others.
- No, no, no. Please don't...

33:51.034 --> 33:53.670
No. Fucking leave him.

33:53.870 --> 33:57.340
I've seen donkeys with three legs
move faster than this ass.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.309
Yalla Imshi, Hartmann.

33:59.409 --> 34:01.377
Just remember what I showed you.

34:01.477 --> 34:05.916
Look for the hand and footholds, think about
how you're going to get there, then move.

34:06.016 --> 34:10.203
Come on, princes, it's just one hand
in front the other. That's not hard.

34:14.393 --> 34:15.715
Can we just go?

34:15.815 --> 34:18.962
Alright. Let's give him ten to
decide if he wants to climb

34:19.062 --> 34:23.303
- or live on a ledge for the rest of his life.
- No, no. No, no, wait, wait, please!

34:24.734 --> 34:26.585
Guys.

34:27.570 --> 34:29.388
Fuck!

34:32.108 --> 34:35.063
Now you know what it feels like
to be left hanging.

34:35.164 --> 34:39.235
Not very fun, is it? Not knowing
if anyone's coming back to get you.

34:39.514 --> 34:42.067
Please, don't. Come back!

34:44.187 --> 34:46.706
Look, I can't move.

34:52.128 --> 34:55.231
Okay, listen to me. Just... breathe.

34:55.331 --> 34:59.753
Pretend it's the...
climbing wall at Chelsea Piers.

35:00.703 --> 35:03.055
You can do it.

35:22.758 --> 35:24.627
See?

35:24.727 --> 35:27.163
Fear is all in the mind.

35:27.263 --> 35:29.316
Let's go.

35:39.575 --> 35:41.211
Hey...

35:41.311 --> 35:43.346
Thanks for back there.

35:43.446 --> 35:47.117
- I'm not a huge fan of heights.
- Everyone's afraid of something.

35:47.217 --> 35:50.670
Hey, hey, Amy, please.

35:52.422 --> 35:55.807
I honestly don't remember
what happened that night.

35:56.426 --> 36:00.012
I mean, I remember getting wasted
and having a really great time, but...

36:00.796 --> 36:03.548
I don't remember the crash at all.

36:05.735 --> 36:08.188
I don't know if I ran.

36:14.077 --> 36:18.685
We should catch up to Maxwell,
before he lays the bait.

36:28.058 --> 36:30.560
You're making something.

36:30.660 --> 36:35.466
Yeah. It's a... a fishing fly.

36:36.466 --> 36:39.503
My dad taught me how
to make these when I was a kid.

36:40.353 --> 36:42.838
Feels like a lifetime ago.

36:47.610 --> 36:51.363
Take a look around.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

36:53.483 --> 36:57.420
Clean air, trees, no skyscrapers,

36:57.520 --> 37:00.556
no neon signs, no pollution.

37:00.656 --> 37:02.993
Where would you be,
if you weren't here right now?

37:03.093 --> 37:06.262
Getting wasted with a bunch of strangers?

37:08.798 --> 37:13.386
Here, we have all this space to think.
It's kinda nice.

37:14.237 --> 37:16.306
It sounds like Maxwell's getting to you.

37:16.406 --> 37:19.509
Or maybe I just have
a lot of thinking to do.

37:19.609 --> 37:20.976
About what?

37:21.076 --> 37:25.064
Well, in five days,
I inherit the money my dad left me.

37:26.382 --> 37:29.753
And the truth is, I'm terrified.

37:30.253 --> 37:32.522
Of letting him down...

37:32.622 --> 37:35.074
...of screwing it up.

37:39.629 --> 37:42.382
He gave me this before he died.

37:48.804 --> 37:52.542
"When you were born,
you cried and the world rejoiced.

37:52.642 --> 37:56.746
"Live your life so that when you die,
the world cries and you rejoice."

37:56.846 --> 37:59.534
It's an old Cherokee saying.

38:02.252 --> 38:06.338
I just... don't want my life
to mean nothing, you know?

38:11.727 --> 38:14.697
So, you're depressed because
you got all this money coming in

38:14.797 --> 38:17.349
and you don't know how to spend it.

38:21.871 --> 38:25.508
I thought you, of all people,
might understand.

38:25.608 --> 38:28.261
I guess I was wrong.

38:34.024 --> 38:36.029
Yeah?

38:36.129 --> 38:39.405
Show me what you got. This way.

39:11.687 --> 39:13.823
Hartmann.

39:13.923 --> 39:16.541
I want you to cut its throat.

39:17.393 --> 39:20.818
It's not easy to take a life, but sometimes
it's the only thing that stands between you

39:20.918 --> 39:23.145
and survival.

39:28.238 --> 39:30.523
I can do it.

40:03.339 --> 40:06.059
Great. We just killed Bambi.

40:11.781 --> 40:16.719
I give thanks to this beautiful creature
whose life we have taken.

40:16.819 --> 40:19.455
And to this land...

40:19.955 --> 40:23.308
and also to all of you.

40:25.161 --> 40:28.335
I was sent to this place
as a punishment...

40:30.165 --> 40:35.020
...but for the first time in my life,
I feel free.

40:36.005 --> 40:38.974
And still my life is my own.

40:39.074 --> 40:43.294
And... it's because of all of you.

40:44.314 --> 40:48.418
It doesn't matter who are parents are.
We don't have to be like them.

40:48.518 --> 40:51.588
We can make our own lives.

40:52.388 --> 40:54.741
We can be free.

40:56.191 --> 40:58.779
Amen to that.

41:01.664 --> 41:03.266
Very good.

41:03.366 --> 41:06.468
All right, fellas. Dig in.

41:10.673 --> 41:13.214
Oh, it's tough!

41:14.344 --> 41:18.081
- That's not tough, that's tender.
- It's food.

41:18.181 --> 41:20.648
Tender like you, Maxwell?

41:23.018 --> 41:26.006
Marsac... better than that goo
that serve you at the orphanage, huh?

41:29.725 --> 41:31.477
Bit of jungle music.

41:33.062 --> 41:34.914
Music!

41:38.801 --> 41:40.820
Whoo!

42:22.778 --> 42:25.430
I'm the only king of the jungle!

43:10.860 --> 43:14.714
We're in position.
You giving the green light or not?

43:17.850 --> 43:20.069
Roger that.

43:36.051 --> 43:38.303
Birthday blues?

43:38.788 --> 43:41.056
Yeah, sort of.

43:41.156 --> 43:43.893
Just thinking about my dad.

43:43.993 --> 43:47.146
Today's the day he gives me his last gift.

43:48.431 --> 43:50.616
It just feels weird, you know?

43:54.737 --> 43:56.972
Listen to me.

43:57.372 --> 44:00.025
Your dad believed in you.

44:00.743 --> 44:02.244
That's why he gave you that note.

44:02.344 --> 44:06.666
He knew that you'd take the money and
use it for something to make a difference.

44:07.650 --> 44:11.904
You just... gotta believe in yourself.

44:13.823 --> 44:15.925
I mean, hating your stepdad because...

44:16.025 --> 44:19.213
he's not your real dad,
that's just gonna eat you up inside.

44:20.395 --> 44:22.532
That's what anger and hate does.

44:22.632 --> 44:25.085
Trust me, I should know.

44:30.640 --> 44:34.109
Maybe Maxwell's right.
Everybody deserves a second chance.

45:02.304 --> 45:04.656
All right, man.

45:37.707 --> 45:39.924
Are you ready?

45:52.021 --> 45:54.239
Time to move.

46:17.513 --> 46:19.865
That was good!

46:21.551 --> 46:25.204
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
take your seats.

47:55.310 --> 47:57.269
Man down.

48:01.381 --> 48:03.335
<i># ...How the wind doth blow</i>

48:03.435 --> 48:07.222
<i># It stings the toes and bites the nose
As over the ground we go</i>

48:07.322 --> 48:10.660
- And happy birthday to...
- Amy!

48:13.028 --> 48:14.847
Speech!

48:15.898 --> 48:18.433
You are so uncool, Mr. Maxwell.

48:18.533 --> 48:21.881
I take that as the highest compliment,
Miss Tilton.

48:30.479 --> 48:33.515
Waiter. I would like a bottle
of your finest champagne.

48:33.615 --> 48:37.587
- Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. Crystal, sir?
- Come on, "Cristal", Mr. Close.

48:37.687 --> 48:40.488
That's what I said. Tuck in.

48:40.923 --> 48:42.743
Hey...

48:54.236 --> 48:56.806
Everybody say cheese.

48:59.074 --> 49:01.975
Stay back! Come on now. Who are you...

49:02.244 --> 49:04.546
Down. On the floor now!

49:06.248 --> 49:08.217
Take it easy, man. Take it easy.

49:09.384 --> 49:12.521
- Oh, my God!
- Over there! On the other side!

49:12.621 --> 49:14.858
- Move.
- Get down.

49:14.958 --> 49:17.026
- On the floor now.
- Get down.

49:17.126 --> 49:20.461
Someone tell Miss Oshimoto
to shut the fuck up.

49:22.765 --> 49:25.200
- Maxwell. Maxwell!
- You!

49:25.300 --> 49:28.137
- Get down! Come here!
- Alright, alright!

49:28.237 --> 49:31.555
- Move.
- On your knees.

49:32.038 --> 49:34.693
Shut your fucking mouth!

49:36.679 --> 49:39.982
Nobody else gets hurt
if you do exactly what we tell you.

49:40.482 --> 49:42.935
Do as you're fucking told, alright?

49:46.421 --> 49:48.973
We're missing Hartmann.

49:53.863 --> 49:55.164
Where is he?

49:55.264 --> 49:58.098
- They've taken their masks off.
- Shut up.

50:02.404 --> 50:05.056
He didn't show up for dinner.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.276
He's often late.

50:07.376 --> 50:11.059
You're supposed to know where
everyone is at all times, Mr. Close.

50:33.502 --> 50:36.055
Any ideas where he might be?

50:46.781 --> 50:50.385
I don't want to have to hurt anyone.

50:50.485 --> 50:54.023
- Please don't make me have to.
- He's in his room.

50:54.123 --> 50:56.775
That's where I saw him last.

50:57.326 --> 50:59.177
Go.

51:03.247 --> 51:06.517
Do not fucking talk. Hartmann's
your room-mate. Where would he go?

51:07.436 --> 51:09.474
We're not gonna tell you.

51:15.077 --> 51:17.365
Do you really think that worthless coward
would do the same thing for you,

51:17.465 --> 51:20.015
or have you got a short memory?

51:20.115 --> 51:22.234
You know nothing about him.

51:26.321 --> 51:29.859
All we want to do is make sure he's safe.

51:29.959 --> 51:33.796
It's cold out there. Dangerous.

51:34.096 --> 51:37.927
Come on, Amy.
Why would we want to hurt any of you?

51:38.400 --> 51:41.053
You're worth nothing to us dead.

51:48.510 --> 51:50.962
Put them somewhere secure.

52:08.147 --> 52:11.083
Of course I understand the complications.

52:11.433 --> 52:13.703
We'll find him.

52:14.203 --> 52:17.773
This is just a minor glitch
and will be resolved quickly.

52:18.273 --> 52:21.477
Yeah. Understood.

52:22.277 --> 52:26.248
Look, I need Hartmann here,
and I need him here now. Clock's ticking.

52:26.348 --> 52:29.184
Alright. He's just a frightened kid.

52:29.284 --> 52:32.391
- We'll handle it.
- Good.

52:37.392 --> 52:39.244
Hey.

52:40.795 --> 52:43.065
You okay?

52:43.465 --> 52:44.899
We're gonna be fine.

52:44.999 --> 52:48.503
Okay, are parents are gonna pay up,
and then we all get to go home.

52:48.603 --> 52:50.855
Your parents.

52:52.741 --> 52:54.910
I don't have any parents.

52:55.010 --> 52:57.647
I have a board of trustees.

52:58.047 --> 53:02.551
You really think these fuckers are stupid
to try and get money out of some lawyers?

53:02.651 --> 53:06.121
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm on my own.

53:06.221 --> 53:10.975
So if your parents need any extra persuasion,
guess who's gonna get a bullet first.

53:13.995 --> 53:16.499
It will not come to that.

53:16.899 --> 53:19.952
I'm sure our parents
will cover your share.

53:21.403 --> 53:23.273
Yeah.

53:24.173 --> 53:26.058
Yeah, let's just hope
that doesn't cause any problems.

53:26.158 --> 53:27.776
- Hey!
- Oh, fuck. What?

53:27.876 --> 53:31.513
I'm a fucking problem now 'cause
my parents are dead. Is that it?

53:31.613 --> 53:35.550
- That's what it fucking sounded like.
- Enough! Shut up! Shut the fuck up.

53:37.219 --> 53:39.771
We have to stick together now.

53:40.789 --> 53:42.724
Why don't you tell that to Kyle?

53:42.824 --> 53:45.260
When he comes out
from whatever rock he's hiding under.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.462
He just did what any one of us
would have done.

53:47.562 --> 53:49.498
- No.
- And, besides...

53:49.598 --> 53:53.403
he's worth a lot more to us out there
than he is tied up in here.

53:54.003 --> 53:58.194
If he can help us, he will.
I know he will.

53:59.941 --> 54:02.181
I really hope he doesn't let you down.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.833
Fuck!

56:05.334 --> 56:06.785
Jesus Christ!

56:10.004 --> 56:12.958
<i>To all parents: We have your children.</i>

56:13.058 --> 56:17.146
<i>They are alive and will remain so,
provided you follow our instructions precisely.</i>

56:17.246 --> 56:22.084
<i>At 18:00, Eastern Standard Time tomorrow,
you are to convene at a secure location,</i>

56:22.184 --> 56:24.953
<i>the coordinates for which
will be sent to Mr. Robert Hartmann.</i>

56:25.053 --> 56:28.157
<i>You will wait there until further contact.</i>

56:28.257 --> 56:31.443
<i>Mr. Hartmann, it is your responsibility
to arrange transportation.</i>

56:31.543 --> 56:34.229
<i>Anyone who chooses not to attend,</i>

56:34.329 --> 56:36.598
<i>be aware that your child's life
will be terminated.</i>

56:41.720 --> 56:45.813
<i>The ransom is one billion dollars
and is non-negotiable.</i>

56:54.883 --> 56:58.037
- I didn't see Kyle.
- What do you want to do?

57:00.154 --> 57:02.657
They're holding all the cards.

57:03.157 --> 57:05.610
We do whatever they say.

57:56.878 --> 57:58.880
Jesus Christ, Hartmann, it's me!
It's Croft!

57:58.980 --> 58:00.349
Don't you fucking move!

58:00.449 --> 58:03.552
- Fuck, am I glad...
- I said stay back!

58:03.652 --> 58:06.704
Okay. I thought you were one of them.

58:07.522 --> 58:10.641
They slaughtered everybody
at the bunkhouse.

58:12.661 --> 58:15.413
So why the hell did they spare you?

58:16.698 --> 58:20.519
I saw it happen. I ran away.
I'm not a hero, okay?

58:26.007 --> 58:30.246
- You did nothing?
- Look, what use is one gun against them?

58:31.546 --> 58:34.048
I reckon our best bet is to get
to the shore boat, right?

58:34.148 --> 58:36.017
Pray to God it's still in one piece.

58:36.217 --> 58:39.270
At least we stand a better chance
of getting help.

58:46.761 --> 58:50.214
Fine. We've gotta go right now.

58:51.400 --> 58:54.174
I've got him. We're on our way.

58:57.539 --> 58:59.609
It's just a bit of business, kid.

59:00.609 --> 59:03.445
You say "hi" to your mum and dad...

59:03.545 --> 59:07.102
we get paid...
you and your buddies can go home.

59:07.882 --> 59:09.268
Move.

59:18.460 --> 59:20.712
Keep moving.

59:38.713 --> 59:40.098
Stop it!

01:00:58.192 --> 01:01:02.834
- Why would they bring us here?
- Because it's in the middle of nowhere.

01:01:10.572 --> 01:01:13.608
- Better call the FBI, there and then...
- Darling, please. You can't ju...

01:01:13.708 --> 01:01:17.076
- Don't tell me what I can and can't do.
- Welcome.

01:01:17.176 --> 01:01:20.582
I'm Thomas Herrick,
and this is my wife, Frances.

01:01:20.682 --> 01:01:22.083
What took you so long?

01:01:22.183 --> 01:01:25.720
Jonathan Tilton-Schofield.
This is my wife, Emily.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.457
We got here as fast as we could.

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:32.494
Oh, you're wasting your time.
There's no power.

01:01:33.394 --> 01:01:38.196
I don't get it. Why go to the bother of
bringing it in when you can't turn it on?

01:01:38.296 --> 01:01:39.968
They wouldn't.

01:01:40.068 --> 01:01:42.871
Maybe there's a generator here somewhere.

01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:45.139
I could take a look.

01:01:45.339 --> 01:01:48.076
Mr. Thornton... care to give me a hand?

01:01:48.176 --> 01:01:53.231
Of course. It's been a while since
I had a chance to get my hands dirty.

01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:00.956
So...

01:02:01.756 --> 01:02:06.829
You still think grounding our son halfway
round the world was such a good idea?

01:02:07.129 --> 01:02:09.764
Well, that wasn't your call
to make, was it?

01:02:09.864 --> 01:02:12.901
I would never have sent him to that place.

01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:15.253
Ever.

01:02:18.873 --> 01:02:23.978
- Lisa Hartmann. I'm Kyle's mother.
- Francesca. My daughter is Paloma.

01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:27.256
Emily Tilton-Schofield. I'm Amy's mom.

01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:30.974
- When did you arrive?
- About an hour ago.

01:02:31.074 --> 01:02:34.989
I traveled with the Herricks. I had
a look around. There's not much here.

01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:38.493
There's a bathroom, a kettle. No food.

01:02:38.593 --> 01:02:40.995
They don't want us to be too comfortable.

01:02:41.395 --> 01:02:43.898
Agreeing to come out here was a mistake.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:46.601
I really think we should at least
discuss the possibility

01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:49.270
of handing the situation
over to trained professionals.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.806
Well, we found a power switch, at least.

01:02:51.906 --> 01:02:53.975
I hear what you're saying, Mrs. Herrick...

01:02:54.075 --> 01:02:56.945
but contacting the FBI's
just not an option.

01:02:57.045 --> 01:03:00.749
If we call them, we are effectively signing
our children's death warrant.

01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:04.411
- Where are the other parents?
- Marsac is a trust-fund baby.

01:03:04.511 --> 01:03:09.510
No parents to negotiate with.
And we may have an issue with Oshimoto.

01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:12.661
- I'm not sure he's going to pay.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:12.761 --> 01:03:16.464
I have my best man dealing
with it, so... it won't be a problem.

01:03:16.564 --> 01:03:20.401
But if it is,
who's gonna make up the shortfall?

01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:24.138
I can cover Mr. Oshimoto's share,
if it comes to that.

01:03:24.238 --> 01:03:28.743
I'm sure if we pool our resources,
we could manage Marsac's between us.

01:03:28.843 --> 01:03:32.196
With what?
This will leave us with nothing.

01:03:35.183 --> 01:03:39.363
<i>Took a while.
I've just found Crofton. He's dead.</i>

01:03:39.663 --> 01:03:43.758
- <i>His neck's broken.</i>
- You think it was Hartmann?

01:03:43.858 --> 01:03:47.596
Who else? I found Croft's weapon
at the bottom of the cove.

01:03:47.696 --> 01:03:51.199
His radio's gone.
Do you want me to keep searching?

01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:55.019
No. It'll be dark soon. Come back in.

01:03:58.807 --> 01:04:00.975
Croft's dead.

01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:02.611
Must've been careless.

01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:05.648
- Want me to go and help Dorsey?
- No.

01:04:06.948 --> 01:04:10.301
He's heading back.
We stick to the plan for now.

01:04:10.919 --> 01:04:14.545
You make your tapes. We might need them.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:28.887
Hartmann.

01:04:29.938 --> 01:04:32.391
You out there?

01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:38.262
<i>Well, if you are,
I've gotta congratulate you.</i>

01:04:39.247 --> 01:04:41.600
<i>You took down one of my best men.</i>

01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:45.353
<i>But enough's enough.</i>

01:04:45.453 --> 01:04:47.866
<i>If you come in now...</i>

01:04:47.966 --> 01:04:50.892
<i>we can get this over and done with.</i>

01:04:50.992 --> 01:04:54.163
Everyone can go home, safe and sound.

01:04:55.196 --> 01:04:57.966
<i>The alternative is I'll come after you.</i>

01:04:58.066 --> 01:05:00.744
<i>And I won't stop until you're dead.</i>

01:05:01.244 --> 01:05:03.855
<i>Or maybe I'm just talking to myself.</i>

01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:08.993
Kyle?

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.098
Kyle.

01:05:30.564 --> 01:05:35.269
<i>They are telling me... to send
this tape to you. At least save me.</i>

01:05:35.369 --> 01:05:37.171
<i>Look, I'm not the same as
everyone else, alright?</i>

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:39.773
<i>I don't have people to talk to.
I don't know what you want me to say.</i>

01:05:39.873 --> 01:05:42.210
<i>Fucking speak!</i>

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:46.264
Please... do what these people
are asking of you.

01:05:46.915 --> 01:05:49.033
<i>Give us a chance to work everything out.</i>

01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:52.837
<i>Please, just go along
with everything they say.</i>

01:06:00.862 --> 01:06:04.409
- You're next, sweetie.
- Why's she shutting the door?

01:06:04.509 --> 01:06:08.217
- Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth!
- Why's she shutting the door?

01:06:13.341 --> 01:06:16.310
I just want you to look pretty
for your close-up, Amy.

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:17.879
You know...

01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:21.049
I'm really not so different to you.

01:06:21.149 --> 01:06:25.162
Maybe in another situation
we could even have been friends.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:30.441
Hm. Pretty cool to fall
for a guy in a place like this.

01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:34.237
Believe me...

01:06:34.337 --> 01:06:38.132
I know how hard it is to find someone
you can really connect with.

01:06:38.232 --> 01:06:42.071
Do you really think
that I'm stupid enough to trust you?

01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.807
There isn't a place
in this entire universe

01:06:45.907 --> 01:06:49.560
that you and I would ever,
ever be friends.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.649
You know... I've done my research...

01:06:55.749 --> 01:06:58.006
I know all about you.

01:06:58.106 --> 01:07:01.572
The drugs, the one-night stands.

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:05.743
Now, be a good girl and say "hi" to Mummy.

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.120
- Did you get anything from Tilton?
- No, not yet.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.489
But I could force it from her.

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.892
We're getting rid of them all
anyway, right?

01:08:10.992 --> 01:08:13.862
Of course. Keep 'em
in the equipment room for now.

01:08:13.962 --> 01:08:17.999
Our partner's asking questions
and I have nothing to say.

01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:20.600
Hartmann's important.

01:08:20.701 --> 01:08:22.871
If we can't find him,
there could be complications.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.206
We can always cut and run.
If there's too much heat...

01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:27.809
No. Fuck that.
Pay-off's too rich on this one.

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:32.046
I want to see the look on this prick's face
when I throw him off a fucking cliff.

01:08:32.145 --> 01:08:34.314
These people are parasites.

01:08:34.415 --> 01:08:36.897
They don't deserve to live.

01:08:38.852 --> 01:08:42.372
Alright. I'm gonna make this call.

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:47.461
You brought guns? Why would you do that?

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:51.332
We're fish in a barrel here.

01:08:51.432 --> 01:08:54.952
I'm not leaving myself
completely defenseless.

01:08:55.502 --> 01:08:57.872
A .243 Rigby...

01:08:57.971 --> 01:09:00.393
and a pair of purdeys.

01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:07.698
Answer it.

01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:17.020
<i>Looks like we're missing a few people.
My instructions were very clear.</i>

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:21.429
Oshimoto is delayed. Marsac is an orphan.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:24.247
<i>Well, I assume you've thought
of ways to make up the shortfall.</i>

01:09:24.348 --> 01:09:26.600
That's really none of your business.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.203
And I'm not discussing the ransom
with you until I see my son.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:34.692
<i>Your son ran off when he saw
his friends in trouble.</i>

01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:38.011
<i>Once a coward, always a coward, huh?</i>

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:40.714
<i>This is not a business negotiation.</i>

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:44.818
<i>I meant what I said about
the consequences of non-compliance.</i>

01:09:44.917 --> 01:09:47.721
And I meant what I said.

01:09:48.522 --> 01:09:52.426
If we don't get proof of life,
you don't get the money.

01:09:52.526 --> 01:09:54.261
Hartmann.

01:09:54.362 --> 01:09:56.697
- Are you mad?
- Who said you could speak for us?

01:09:56.797 --> 01:09:59.968
- I'm sure he'll call back.
- This is reckless.

01:10:00.068 --> 01:10:01.770
My son is unaccounted for.

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:06.007
- There are other lives at stake here.
- I think Mr. Hartmann is right.

01:10:06.107 --> 01:10:10.728
I'm sure that they will call back and with it,
proof that all of our children are alive.

01:10:11.345 --> 01:10:13.797
It's just a matter of time.

01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:29.079
Maxwell...

01:11:30.291 --> 01:11:32.944
<i>Dorsey, get back here now.</i>

01:12:03.657 --> 01:12:05.909
Fuck, man.

01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:11.199
- No way. I don't believe it.
- Kyle?

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:13.000
- Son of a bitch.
- You came back.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.571
- Yeah.
- Am I happy to see you.

01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:20.608
You should be halfway
to the Hamptons by now, buddy.

01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:22.376
- I hope you didn't bet on it.
- No.

01:12:22.476 --> 01:12:24.813
Let's get you out.

01:12:25.413 --> 01:12:27.648
Look... you're better
at this stuff than me.

01:12:27.748 --> 01:12:32.153
Okay, we need to get supplies and we gotta
go right now. They're not fucking around.

01:12:32.253 --> 01:12:35.756
They're gonna kill us.
Ransom or no ransom.

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:39.593
Okay. Okay. Guys, grab what you can.

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:42.646
Supplies, equipment, anything.
We gotta go now.

01:12:44.732 --> 01:12:46.767
- Marsac.
- Let's go.

01:12:46.867 --> 01:12:50.871
I will not let this little prick
turn my operation into a circus.

01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:55.359
Bring me Tilton. If she knows something,
she's gonna tell us now.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.035
What?

01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:26.139
Okay, Marsac, Fayed.

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:29.710
You, Amy, Keiko head up the north
trail to the old farm.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:32.997
- Okay? We know there's shelter there.
- No, no. We're not splitting up. Why?

01:13:33.097 --> 01:13:35.661
Because two groups are harder
to track than one. Alright?

01:13:35.761 --> 01:13:39.002
So stay out of sight
and cover your tracks. Okay?

01:13:42.423 --> 01:13:45.276
We need to go. Now.

01:13:46.527 --> 01:13:48.979
I'll see you later.

01:13:53.534 --> 01:13:56.937
"He's just a frightened kid", yet he's
managed to take out one of our men

01:13:57.037 --> 01:13:59.240
and release seven fucking
hostages on our watch!

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.343
They can't have gone far.
We'll track 'em and bring 'em back.

01:14:02.443 --> 01:14:05.964
They have no way of getting off the island.
It's just a matter of flushing them out...

01:14:06.064 --> 01:14:11.662
Then do it! I want 'em found by morning.
No more fucking surprises!

01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:37.328
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm coming. Okay?

01:14:37.428 --> 01:14:39.277
Okay.

01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:10.478
If they were gonna call back,
they would've done it by now.

01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:13.113
Maybe they're out looking for the boy.

01:15:13.213 --> 01:15:15.799
Or maybe they've lost patience.

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.351
We're wasting time here.

01:15:30.864 --> 01:15:34.460
- Any word from Oshimoto?
- Not yet.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.472
But I've been crunching the numbers.
Now, we can cash for the ransom,

01:15:38.572 --> 01:15:42.636
but if we take that money out of
the business, it will kill the merger...

01:15:43.143 --> 01:15:46.981
which leaves us
in a potentially difficult position.

01:15:48.281 --> 01:15:51.485
You mean, that leaves me
potentially bankrupt

01:15:51.585 --> 01:15:54.187
and you potentially unemployed? Hm?

01:15:54.287 --> 01:15:58.379
Well, let's not get melodramatic here,
Bobby. There are always solutions.

01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:02.463
Westcom said no, Marcos.

01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:05.599
Unless I can find 250 million...

01:16:05.699 --> 01:16:08.686
<i>the merger's dead in the water,
ransom or not.</i>

01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:13.357
Call me back when you hear from Oshimoto.

01:17:39.426 --> 01:17:41.678
Keep moving.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:59.179
How are you holding up?

01:17:59.279 --> 01:18:01.615
Same as the rest of you.

01:18:01.715 --> 01:18:04.301
Waiting for the phone to ring.

01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:12.493
Look, I know it was a risk.

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:15.529
But I have to make sure my son is okay.

01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:17.514
Mm-hm.

01:18:17.965 --> 01:18:20.568
All any of us ever try to do

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:23.104
is protect our children. Right?

01:18:23.804 --> 01:18:26.039
Our children?

01:18:26.439 --> 01:18:28.642
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

01:18:28.742 --> 01:18:32.062
- Nothing, nothing.
- Listen...

01:18:32.646 --> 01:18:36.283
It's just, uh...
my Amy was the girl who, uh...

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:38.919
was with Kyle,
the night he wrecked his car.

01:18:39.019 --> 01:18:43.423
I was the one who agreed to keep it quiet
when you bribed that judge.

01:18:43.523 --> 01:18:46.810
But how were you to know about that?
I mean, you had your best man deal with it.

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:51.914
And it must be nice to have a man
like Shah get his hands dirty for you.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.536
And I suppose that's why they made you
the point of contact. Because...

01:18:56.636 --> 01:19:00.157
you've got a history of getting
exactly what you want.

01:19:03.944 --> 01:19:07.615
- Yeah?
- <i>I've heard back from Oshimoto.</i>

01:19:07.715 --> 01:19:10.150
I'm putting you on speaker.

01:19:11.785 --> 01:19:17.211
<i>Oshimoto's people have calculated the odds
of his daughter surviving at 30-70.</i>

01:19:17.991 --> 01:19:21.355
He's out. He's not paying.

01:19:22.596 --> 01:19:24.031
Based on what?

01:19:24.331 --> 01:19:27.384
Kidnappings over the last ten years.

01:19:28.902 --> 01:19:31.388
Maybe he has a point.

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:36.577
So, you're saying 'cause... we can't
trust these guys we shouldn't pay 'em.

01:19:36.677 --> 01:19:39.146
<i>That's not for me to say.</i>

01:19:39.246 --> 01:19:41.114
But...

01:19:41.614 --> 01:19:44.184
could call their bluff.

01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:47.688
Likelihood is they're not gonna
go through with their threat.

01:19:47.788 --> 01:19:50.721
Kill eight kids? To what end?

01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:55.078
<i>But if they do go through with it?</i>

01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:01.835
Let's be honest here.

01:20:02.335 --> 01:20:06.590
These kids... have caused you
nothing but grief.

01:20:08.509 --> 01:20:11.161
<i>Maybe you'd all be better off.</i>

01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:19.014
Marcos?

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:22.890
You remember our conversation, earlier,
about you being unemployed?

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.578
- Yes.
- That time has come.

01:20:39.907 --> 01:20:41.758
Hey.

01:20:43.643 --> 01:20:45.862
What is it?

01:20:46.914 --> 01:20:48.115
It's Keiko.

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:50.684
Oh... is she... is she hurt?

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:57.590
She didn't tell us in time.
She didn't want to hold us back.

01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:59.776
How bad?

01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:04.515
We couldn't stop her bleeding. She's dead.

01:21:05.733 --> 01:21:07.735
I'm so sorry.

01:21:07.835 --> 01:21:09.602
What?

01:21:09.702 --> 01:21:12.229
What do you mean she's...
She's not fucking dead!

01:21:12.329 --> 01:21:14.094
Thornton!

01:21:58.652 --> 01:22:00.503
Kyle!

01:22:33.486 --> 01:22:35.405
Kyle Hartmann...

01:22:37.424 --> 01:22:40.661
I can't tell you how much
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

01:22:41.061 --> 01:22:46.049
- Yeah, well, I can't say the same about you.
- Oh, that hurts. Now drop the bow.

01:22:54.842 --> 01:22:57.393
Drop the bow!

01:22:58.311 --> 01:23:00.763
On your knees!

01:23:02.549 --> 01:23:06.735
On... your... knees!

01:23:07.888 --> 01:23:10.206
Hands behind your back.

01:23:11.058 --> 01:23:13.393
Can't wait to see Amy's face

01:23:13.493 --> 01:23:17.297
when I hand her boyfriend's head
on a plate.

01:23:17.397 --> 01:23:19.867
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:22.186
Biblical almost.

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:44.906
- Okay, are you ready?
- Let's just do it.

01:24:45.006 --> 01:24:48.275
- One...
- Two... three.

01:24:49.822 --> 01:24:53.994
Hey, hey. Hey, you're doing great.
We're almost there.

01:24:54.494 --> 01:24:57.030
I think I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.233
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why risk your life like that?

01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:04.820
You risked your life for us. I was...
I was just returning the favor.

01:25:11.511 --> 01:25:13.863
Are you crazy?

01:25:15.415 --> 01:25:17.667
Maybe I am.

01:25:31.564 --> 01:25:33.934
<i>This is FBI Special Agent Jess Chambliss.</i>

01:25:34.034 --> 01:25:36.336
<i>Don't worry, this is a secure line.</i>

01:25:36.436 --> 01:25:38.939
<i>We understand your concern
for your children's safety</i>

01:25:39.039 --> 01:25:41.341
<i>but you've done the right thing
in contacting us.</i>

01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:44.211
I'm sorry about your son, Mr. Hartmann.

01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:47.514
- Somebody had to do something.
- <i>We are working with the UK authorities</i>

01:25:47.614 --> 01:25:50.783
<i>and together we are drawing up plans
for the safe recovery of your children.</i>

01:25:50.883 --> 01:25:53.286
Plans? What plans?

01:25:53.686 --> 01:25:57.257
<i>I'm afraid I can't discuss that
at this time, Mr. Hartmann.</i>

01:25:57.357 --> 01:25:59.860
I'll have my jet back here
within the hour.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.761
I'll be in Scotland in less than seven.

01:26:01.861 --> 01:26:04.998
<i>Mr. Hartmann, I strongly advise you
to stay where you are.</i>

01:26:05.098 --> 01:26:07.568
<i>By going out there you jeopardize
not only your own safety,</i>

01:26:07.668 --> 01:26:10.070
<i>but the success of the recovery mission.</i>

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.006
I'm done leaving my son's life
in other people's hands.

01:26:13.106 --> 01:26:16.409
I'm not going to sit and wait
for you guys to bring me bad news.

01:26:16.509 --> 01:26:17.877
- <i>Mr. Hartmann...</i>
- Bobby, wait.

01:26:17.977 --> 01:26:20.813
- <i>Mr. Hartmann!</i>
- I'd like to come along.

01:26:20.913 --> 01:26:23.216
See if I can help.

01:26:23.816 --> 01:26:26.586
What are you going to do
when you get there?

01:26:26.686 --> 01:26:28.405
Whatever I have to do.

01:26:34.894 --> 01:26:37.030
I have to rest, Kyle.

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:39.266
- Oh...
- We can't. We can't rest here.

01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:41.401
Then you have to go without me.

01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:45.005
I can slow them down.
Give you a chance to get ahead.

01:26:45.105 --> 01:26:48.241
Amy... I'm not going anywhere without you.

01:26:48.341 --> 01:26:51.294
Okay? Not this time.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.166
How's that? Is that better?

01:27:19.906 --> 01:27:23.210
Don't be stupid! Automatic weapon
versus a bow and arrow?

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:26.890
Fucking throw it to the ground now! Now!

01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:32.019
Okay, stop! Stop, okay?

01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:34.688
Stand out where I can see you!

01:27:35.488 --> 01:27:38.975
You! Drop your weapon now!

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.095
No.

01:27:42.195 --> 01:27:44.331
What the fuck do you mean, "no"?

01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:46.667
I mean no.

01:27:47.067 --> 01:27:48.901
I'm not gonna drop it.

01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:51.972
Why are you determined
to do this the hard way?

01:27:52.072 --> 01:27:54.964
Drop it. Or I'll shoot you
in your fucking head.

01:27:57.594 --> 01:27:59.879
Everybody stand still!

01:28:01.113 --> 01:28:03.150
What would you do...

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:06.753
if we all rushed you right now, huh?
Would you kill us all?

01:28:06.853 --> 01:28:09.222
I've killed more people
than I can fucking count, mate.

01:28:09.322 --> 01:28:12.075
Yeah? What's another four?

01:28:14.044 --> 01:28:15.878
Don't move!

01:28:15.978 --> 01:28:18.799
If you do that... you get nothing.

01:28:18.899 --> 01:28:20.633
No ransom.

01:28:20.733 --> 01:28:22.736
Is that what you came here for?

01:28:23.236 --> 01:28:25.921
To leave with nothing? Huh?

01:28:28.275 --> 01:28:31.611
I figure we can afford
to kill one of you. Yeah?

01:28:31.711 --> 01:28:34.597
And we'll see how brave the rest
of you really fucking are.

01:29:24.214 --> 01:29:26.484
Just do it.

01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:44.501
We heard shooting.

01:29:46.619 --> 01:29:51.191
- Two more of them are dead now.
- There's still one left.

01:29:51.891 --> 01:29:55.144
He's probably gonna keep coming,
just like he said.

01:29:57.864 --> 01:30:00.176
Then we'll let him.

01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:20.948
Hartmann...

01:31:21.148 --> 01:31:24.317
I don't understand
why you want to take him alive.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:26.153
Yeah, we have got a gun, right?

01:31:26.253 --> 01:31:29.121
All we've got to do is hide
until he appears and shoot him.

01:31:29.221 --> 01:31:31.291
Not if we don't have to.

01:31:31.391 --> 01:31:33.660
Of course we have to.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.095
We've got to kill him before he kills us.

01:31:36.195 --> 01:31:40.000
- Why are we even discussing this?
- Because it's not who we are.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.669
We're not killers.

01:31:42.769 --> 01:31:45.372
Everything we did was in self-defense.

01:31:45.472 --> 01:31:48.938
But this is different, okay?
We have a choice.

01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.783
Fuck!

01:31:57.183 --> 01:32:01.371
Hey! Killing someone isn't
as easy as you think, Marsac.

01:32:05.157 --> 01:32:08.945
Alright, Kyle... what's the plan?

01:32:14.066 --> 01:32:16.703
It's like Maxwell said...

01:32:16.803 --> 01:32:21.341
if we can set the right trap,
in the right place, we can catch anything.

01:32:21.441 --> 01:32:24.844
So, does, um...
anybody know how to use this?

01:32:24.944 --> 01:32:27.880
I've never shot a gun before.
I don't even know what that thing is.

01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:31.684
It's a Bushmaster M16, .223 caliber.

01:32:31.784 --> 01:32:34.036
It's automatic.
Clip holds about 30 rounds.

01:32:34.136 --> 01:32:37.089
Its rate of fire is 800 RPM.

01:32:39.826 --> 01:32:42.079
My dad has one in his collection.

01:32:42.862 --> 01:32:45.365
Well, you just volunteered.

01:32:59.746 --> 01:33:03.350
Okay. Keep out of sight until he passes.

01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:06.353
When he does,
follow him at a safe distance.

01:33:06.453 --> 01:33:08.555
If he starts to turn back,
fire a few shots in the air.

01:33:08.655 --> 01:33:11.524
That should keep him
in the right direction. Okay?

01:33:11.824 --> 01:33:13.976
You got this?

01:33:16.195 --> 01:33:18.047
Okay.

01:34:43.382 --> 01:34:46.083
No! Amy, don't!

01:34:52.524 --> 01:34:55.562
I'm guessing this isn't the way
you saw this going.

01:34:56.062 --> 01:34:58.463
Throw 'em away now!

01:34:59.799 --> 01:35:02.017
Throw 'em!

01:35:13.946 --> 01:35:15.468
Hartmann!

01:35:16.348 --> 01:35:18.751
Don't you think it's time we met?

01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:21.871
I'm done playing games with you.

01:35:25.257 --> 01:35:27.527
Well, haven't you been a busy boy!

01:35:27.627 --> 01:35:30.412
Got a decent bit of blood on your hands.

01:35:30.512 --> 01:35:33.650
Actually, I should thank you.

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.759
You see, I'm flying solo now.
No one to share the ransom with.

01:35:38.871 --> 01:35:41.394
You still think that's gonna happen?

01:35:41.774 --> 01:35:44.243
Oh, I know it's gonna happen.
See, I know exactly

01:35:44.343 --> 01:35:47.498
how much of an investment
you are to your parents.

01:35:49.756 --> 01:35:51.438
Now...

01:35:51.718 --> 01:35:53.285
if you...

01:35:53.385 --> 01:35:57.072
don't march all your friends
down here in 30 seconds...

01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:01.412
I'm gonna shoot your girlfriend
in the fucking face.

01:36:10.336 --> 01:36:13.489
I wouldn't take too much time
to think on it.

01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:39.566
Run!

01:36:54.013 --> 01:36:56.351
Marsac! No!

01:37:12.599 --> 01:37:14.450
Hartmann!

01:37:23.475 --> 01:37:25.487
Marsac!

01:40:55.821 --> 01:40:59.358
Your son was pretty incredible
out there, Mr. Hartmann.

01:40:59.458 --> 01:41:02.077
Sounds like he wasn't alone there.

01:41:02.661 --> 01:41:05.131
You're Amy, aren't you?

01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:08.000
It's nice to finally meet you in person.

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:09.951
Likewise.

01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:20.363
I'll... let you two catch up.

01:41:33.792 --> 01:41:36.344
I can't believe you came.

01:41:37.529 --> 01:41:40.099
Well, I care about you, Amy.

01:41:40.699 --> 01:41:42.985
More than you realize.

01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:14.734
It's hard to believe that this guy Speck
planned this whole thing on his own.

01:42:14.934 --> 01:42:19.518
I suppose the only thing that we're certain
now is that there's no one left to question.

01:42:32.451 --> 01:42:34.703
Why don't you answer it, Jonathan?

01:42:36.955 --> 01:42:40.292
You wanna tell us why the last
seven calls on Speck's sat phone

01:42:40.392 --> 01:42:43.246
came from the one you're holding?

01:42:46.332 --> 01:42:48.801
You couldn't get your grubby hands
on my father's money,

01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:52.071
so you found a way
to get your own, am I right?

01:42:52.171 --> 01:42:54.987
I don't know what she's talking about.
She's hysterical.

01:42:56.242 --> 01:42:58.344
Innocent people are dead because of you.

01:42:58.444 --> 01:43:01.968
My father taught me to live my life
trying to make a difference.

01:43:02.848 --> 01:43:05.401
You've taught me why.

01:43:09.888 --> 01:43:14.809
I've done nothing. She's making it up!
She's never liked me. This is crazy!

01:43:17.796 --> 01:43:19.651
You okay?
