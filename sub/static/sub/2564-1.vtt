- Just one box?
- It's for my office. It's fragile.

(LOUD MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES)
- Hey, dude, headphones.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.276
You're gonna go deaf!

02:55.759 --> 02:58.433
An autograph?

02:58.595 --> 03:01.314
- I just thought that...
- Are you kidding me?

03:09.272 --> 03:11.366
Ma'am?

03:13.568 --> 03:15.616
- Sheriff.
- Your husband around?

MAN: Ashley?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.285
Ashley?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.704
Honey.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.497
Sweetheart.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.338
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.003
Yeah. I know. I think your mom
wants your help unpacking.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.297
I know.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.849
So come outside.
You can finish your painting later.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.886
I didn't wanna move here.
I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

03:39.052 --> 03:43.228
We had to move here
and we all have to help carry boxes.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.769
- Uh-uh. You wanted to move here.
- No, I had to move here.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.233
The new story I'm writing is here.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.524
Why can't you just keep writing
in the old house?

03:51.690 --> 03:55.365
'Cause I was gonna have to write college
textbooks to pay for that old house.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.121
- And I can't do that.
- Why not?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.625
- 'Cause I just can't.
- But I miss my school.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.003
Well, you know what? The school here
is supposed to be pretty great.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.130
But I want my old one.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.420
I know. How about this, all right?
I'll tell you what.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.132
If we don't like it here,
once I sell my book, we'll move back.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.802
But only if we don't like it here.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.016
- Really?
- Really.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.271
You promise?

04:23.430 --> 04:26.400
I promise. But you have to promise
to try to like it here.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.481
- I promise.
- You do? Now, my little artist.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.442
- What's the number one rule?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.733
- Where doesn't it go?
- Anywhere else in the house.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.819
Right. OK, now, come with me.
Move some boxes.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.948
Sheriff's here.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.085
- Already?
- Play nice this time.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.745
- I'm always nice.
- I'm not kidding.

04:46.912 --> 04:50.132
I'm tired of driving five miles under
the speed limit to get ticketed anyway.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.634
Be nice.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.055
Afternoon. Is there a problem?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.262
No, sir. Just a friendly visit.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.347
I appreciate that. Ellison Oswalt.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.138
I know who you are.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.807
- So you're not a fan.
- No.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.476
Well, what can I do for you?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.692
Well, not much, I expect,
unless I can convince you

05:12.854 --> 05:17.280
to load those boxes back on that truck
and leave as soon as you're able.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.365
No, I don't think so,
but, you know what.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.826
I do have a couple of extra copies
of <i>Kentucky Blood</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:24.366
if you want me to get one out
and sign it for you.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.582
- No, thank you, sir.
- Is it the writing?

05:27.744 --> 05:32.420
More a matter of content. You don't seem
to care much for our profession.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.960
Not everybody in your profession
gets it right.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.595
I've read your books. Neither do you.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.971
- Look...
- You got it right in <i>Kentucky Blood.</i>

05:42.133 --> 05:45.307
I'll give you that.
It's a fine piece of writing.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.349
But <i>Cold Denver Morning</i>,
you got it wrong.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.893
<i>- Blood Diner...</i>
- Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?

05:51.101 --> 05:55.732
Your bad theory helped a killer go free.
You ruined people's lives.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.777
Now, this town doesn't need that.
It needs to heal. It needs to forget.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.492
We sure don't want that circus
that you bring with you.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.531
Well, there's a missing girl
involved here.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.669
- She ain't missing. She's dead.
- Come on. You don't know that.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.372
If that girl is still alive,
then it ain't no miracle

06:11.538 --> 06:13.006
and we ain't ever gonna find her.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.542
Then I guess
we should just let it go, huh?

06:15.709 --> 06:19.054
You don't think the town
deserves an explanation?

06:19.212 --> 06:23.592
Something like this... You can
never explain something like this.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.772
And if you were able to, the odds are
you wouldn't much care for the answer.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.228
Now, we did our job. You'll see that.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.988
And this is just another waste
of your time like your last two books.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.566
If writing true crime
has taught me one thing.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.203
It's that whenever an officer of the law
tells me that I'm wasting my time,

06:43.361 --> 06:45.784
it just means
he thinks he's wasting his.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.826
That's clever.
You ought to write that down.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.586
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb

06:51.745 --> 06:54.123
and assume your department
is not at my disposal?

06:54.289 --> 06:58.886
Well, what do you know? You can still
get things right on occasion.

07:01.880 --> 07:08.980
Oh, and... I find this to be
in extremely bad taste.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.866
- What was all that about?
- The usual.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.323
He wanted an autograph,
but he left his copy at home.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.204
- He'll be back later.
- That bad?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.786
- Mm-hm.
- Why was he pointing at the house?

07:29.658 --> 07:33.959
Ellison, we didn't move in a few houses
down from a crime scene again, did we?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.631
- Tracy...
- No, just don't say anything.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.884
If we did, I don't wanna know about it.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.550
- We didn't.
- You promise?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.259
I promise.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.848
Here. Make yourself useful, Kitchen.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.231

and fortune cookies.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.999
Enjoy, kids. We're not likely
to be able to eat out much this time.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.664
- Oh!
- Why not?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.082
- You know why.
- I don't.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.750
We haven't sold the old house yet.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.636
Once it's gone, well be able to afford
a few extra things.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.093
Then sell it already.
Lower the price if you have to.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.553
We've already lowered it
as much as we can.

09:51.716 --> 09:55.061
The market's terrible. Once we're not
paying two mortgages, we'll be fine.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.939
And once I sell my new book,
we'll be on Easy Street.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.193
- Is the story a good one this time?
- Yeah, it's good. Of course it is.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.611
- Will you show me where it happened?
- Trevor.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.443
I'm old enough to know about this stuff.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.279
No, youre not. Even I'm not old enough
to know about this stuff.

about terrible, terrible things.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.746
- I shouldn't be writing about it?
- That's not what I meant.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.578
That's the way you said it.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.663
I'm gonna hear about it
at school anyway.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.420
Kids'll all hate me again
and tell me nonstop what happened.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.502
- Hey, nobody hates you.
- I might as well hear it from you.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.088
- Are you listening to this?
- Yes. I'm listening.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.345
Let's at least make sure
your office stays locked.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.551
It's one thing to hear about it,
another to see it.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.465
I don't want him walking in again.
He's 12.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.427
- Mom, he knows how old I am.
- Hey, stop it.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.847
- What's the first rule?
ALL: - Never go in Dad's office.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.265
And what's the rule?

10:40.431 --> 10:42.980
- Always lock Dad's office.
- That's right.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.238
And I don't wanna hear another thing
about why we're here, from anybody.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.568
Yeah.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.574
You didn't brush your teeth.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.789
- No. not yet.
- You're not coming to bed?

11:00.952 --> 11:04.877
No, I thought I'd set up my office first
and get started.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.212
- How long is it gonna be?
- Just an hour or two.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.970
No, I mean...
how long are we here for this time?

11:11.129 --> 11:14.804
Oh, God' I don't know.
It could be along one.

when you were writing fiction.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.181
- Nobody likes my fiction.
- Maybe you should try again.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.952
I just need another hit, that's all.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.164
- Just one more.
- I just...

11:44.204 --> 11:46.252
What?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.508
- You know I'm behind you on this.
- I know.

11:48.666 --> 11:52.591
But that's not what you were gonna say.
What were you gonna say?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.848
<i>Kentucky Blood</i> was ten years ago.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.474
And?

11:57.634 --> 12:01.434
And... what if that was your 15 minutes?

12:02.764 --> 12:05.813
OK, what if it was?

12:05.975 --> 12:11.106
If it was, you can't just spend
the rest of your life chasing after it.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.196
If you miss out on these years
with the kids, you won't get them back.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.487
I just need one more chance,
that's all, one more.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.327
- OK. good.
- I got a good feeling about this.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.455
But, Ell,
I don't think I can do this again.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.666
- Honey, you're not gonna have to.
- No. I mean it.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.129

12:30.291 --> 12:34.091
I'll take Trevor and Ashley
and go back home to my sister's.

- Yes.

It's not your fault.
Come on. It's cold. Let's go inside.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.034
I was in a box?

26:09.193 --> 26:11.412
- You were in a box.
- I don't remember any of that.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.868
It's not the strangest place
we've ever found you.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.499

26:15.657 --> 26:18.661

Trevor trying to pee in the dryer?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.670
- God, Mom, no.
- I'm sorry, honey.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.877
I thought that's what
you were talking about.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.792
Did Trevor try to pee
in the dryer again?

26:24.958 --> 26:27.677
- Mom.
- No. Your brother had a night terror.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.134
- Is that like a bad dream?
- Kind of.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.425
ASHLEY: Oh, I think I had one of those.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.094
No, a night terror
is a special kind of bad dream.

26:35.260 --> 26:39.265
We would have remembered if you had one.
Don't do that. You can sit right here.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.810
So, Ashley, you excited
about your first day at the new school?

26:42.976 --> 26:44.728
- What about you?
- I guess.

26:44.895 --> 26:48.069
It's nice to see you're both
so enthusiastic about our adventure.

Are you gonna take 'em?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.031
Yeah, I've got some errands to run.

I figured I'd get the lay of the land
and let you get some work done.

- You heard your mother.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.538

- Come on.

- Fine.

- Mom's overreacting.

That your book
is about a family that was hung.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.988

- But that's all he heard?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.069

No, it doesn't make it OK. all right?

56:20.377 --> 56:22.630
Oh, my God. Is he OK?

56:22.796 --> 56:24.548
I found him outside.

56:24.715 --> 56:27.264
We have to put a lock on his door.
It's way worse than it was.

I can bash your head in, OK?

That's fine. You keep it.

57:32.032 --> 57:35.161
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

57:36.244 --> 57:38.212
Trevor's too old
to still be having these.

57:38.372 --> 57:40.249
He was supposed
to have outgrown them by now.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.793
- He's all right. He's OK.
- Just stop.

57:44.127 --> 57:46.425
- Stop what?
- Drop the book.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.141
We can pack up, get out of town
and never look back.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.177
Why, 'cause he's having
some night terrors?

57:52.344 --> 57:54.267
It's more than that.
He's never been this bad.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.852
- You've never been this bad.
- What are you talking about?

57:57.015 --> 57:59.768

I'm saying there's something
you aren't telling me,

58:06.900 --> 58:10.279
something that's eating you up, and it
seems to be getting to Trevor as well.

58:10.445 --> 58:13.324
- Somethings different this time.
- Yeah, you wanna know what it is?

58:13.490 --> 58:16.164
- How much do you wanna know?
- I wanna know why you're different.

58:16.326 --> 58:19.705
I'm different because I've never
been onto something this big before.

58:19.871 --> 58:22.169
Do you remember how it was
when I was writing <i>Kentucky?</i>

58:22.332 --> 58:25.211
- I remember.
- This is much bigger than that! Much!

58:25.377 --> 58:28.221
I am talking about
a potentially important work here.

- I'm just worried about you.
- Well, don't be. Nothing is wrong.

58:54.406 --> 58:57.000
Then why did you come in
white as a ghost?

58:58.243 --> 59:00.962
Because I saw a dog, OK?

59:01.121 --> 59:04.921
- A dog?
- A very big dog, like Cujo big.

59:05.083 --> 59:08.257
I mean, I'd never seen him before.
He's like...

59:08.420 --> 59:10.422
- Did you get rid of him?
- Yeah, he's gone.

59:10.589 --> 59:13.217
Listen, I just need
a little more time. OK?

59:13.383 --> 59:15.681
I promise it's worth it.

Every minute that we're here, we're
a minute closer to that happy ending

- Deputy.
- Mr Oswalt, these came in this morning.

59:34.279 --> 59:37.624
I had a few of the pertinent files
pulled for you and had 'em faxed over.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.126
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:39.284 --> 59:41.378
- Thanks.
- No problem.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.373
Do you think I could come in
for a second?

59:44.539 --> 59:47.509
Uh... Yeah. sure.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.510
- Thanks.
- Come on, just here.

59:49.669 --> 59:52.138
Look, I...
I know what you must think of me.

59:52.297 --> 59:56.598
Some small-town deputy that's starstruck
with the famous writer.

59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.017
- But I'm not some local moron.
- I didn't say you were a... you know.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.684
I have a degree in criminology.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:08.151
I've taken my fair share
of forensic science courses.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:13.570
I also know a series of connected
murders when I see one, Mr Oswalt.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.454
- Look...
- We missed something. I get that.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.787
But if you want me to run interference
for you while you get this worked out.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.830
I gotta be in the loop
just a little bit.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:29.380
- You really wanna help?
- It's my home, Mr Oswalt.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:32.171
What happened here
happened to all of us.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.260
All right. Come here.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.401
Who is that?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.689
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.277
- You think these are serial murders?
- Maybe.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:58.913
More ritualized than necessarily serial.
But really spread out.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:03.794
And not just regionally but over time.
The first one dates back to the '60s.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:07.001
- The 1960s?
- Yeah.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.508
That would put the guy,
what, in his 70s?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.215
- Yeah. or his 60s.
- Yeah, I...

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:15.221
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the methodology.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.884
Toxicology reports. some cases
the killer drugged his victims.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.805
- With what?
- Well, they couldn't tell for sure.

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:27.192
But by drugging them, the killer
removes his need to overpower them.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.603
Here he used a tree branch
to do the heavy lifting.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:33.273
In Sacramento he lit a family on fire.
In St Louis he slit their throats.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.444
- The first family he drowned.
- Drowning? You...

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.079
You never said anything
about anyone being drowned.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.706
The only other significant link
between the murder cases

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:46.086
is that in each instance the killer
murdered the entire family except one.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.246
A child which he took with him.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:54.011
That and this symbol appears
in several of the crime scenes.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:57.264
That looks like something
from out of the occult.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.892
Look' you might wanna
call the university.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.349
There's a professor over there.
Professor Jonas.

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:04.763
He's an occult crime expert

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:08.651
and the state police bring him in
on some of the... the weirder stuff.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.731
I think this qualifies.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.989

that drowning happened?

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.525

<i>Of course, I'm a really big fan.
I'm flattered that you emailed.</i>

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.314
I knew exactly
what cases you were studying.

01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:59.067
Wait. How would you know
what cases I was looking at?

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:03.951
<i>The symbol that you sent me is...
isn't a pentagram.</i>

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:06.111
<i>It's not something
that you would see teenagers</i>

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:10.703
<i>or a Norwegian black metal band paint
on a wall in goat's blood to be edgy.</i>

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.538
- Right.
<i>- Or to piss off the Christians..</i>

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.579
<i>No, this is a little bit more obscure
than that.</i>

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.545
<i>I know the one in the hallway,</i>

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:23.462
<i>that's from the late '90s in St Louis.</i>

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:26.264
<i>The other one, the... the car hood,</i>

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.097
<i>that is from Sacramento,
that's about 30 years ago.</i>

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.011
Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:35.478
<i>It's a symbol associated
with the worship of a pagan deity.</i>

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.358
A deity? What kind of deity?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:41.613
<i>A very obscure one,
dating back to Babylonian times.</i>

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.321
<i>Named Bughuul, the eater of children.</i>

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:50.956
- Did you say eater?
<i>- Yes, of children. Thank you, Jessica.</i>

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:52.787
<i>The crimes that you're dealing with.</i>

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.372
<i>They all have the element
of a missing child, correct?</i>

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:58.038
Yes. Yeah. That's correct.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.333
<i>Well, Bughuul eats children.</i>

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:04.127
<i>Now, the fragments of stories
that have survived,</i>

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:09.683
<i>they all revolve around him needing
the souls of human children to survive.</i>

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:13.937
<i>Now, each story involves a different way</i>

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:19.317
<i>that he lures or tricks these children
away from the physical world</i>

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.650
<i>and traps them in his own netherworld</i>

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.861
<i>and he consumes their souls over time.</i>

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:30.746
<i>Now, any worship of this deity
would include a blood sacrifice</i>

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.578
<i>or the wholesale eating of a child.</i>

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.462
So you're saying the person that made
this symbol is... is eating children?

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.588
<i>Well, that would fit the stories.</i>

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:44.377
<i>Of course, the few times
that this symbol has shown up,</i>

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.842
<i>none of the crimes have been related
in any way to any of this.</i>

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.224
<i>So this might be
more of a cult initiation</i>

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:55.478
<i>rather than, you know,
the actual actions of any one man.</i>

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:01.601
<i>There's been another one, hasn't there?</i>

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.866
I think so, yes.

heard something spooky in the house?

to put yourself in their head space.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:49.296
- No, no, no. I...
- Mr Oswalt. listen. I don't. I don't...

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.932
I'm not saying that you have
a drinking problem. I don't think that.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.764
Nor do I think
that you're making any of this up...

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.724
- No!
- ...to get attention.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.357
What I do think is that...
that you are under so much stress.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.483
You've put yourself
under so much stress.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:07.863
That your mind
is trying to process all of it at once.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:13.321
So you don't believe
any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:16.956
Are you kidding me?
I believe in all that stuff.

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:20.163
I... I wouldn't sleep one night
in this place. Are you nuts?

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:23.296
Four people were hung by their necks
in the tree in your backyard

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:26.378
and that little girl
is probably God knows wherever.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:30.295
- OK.
- I'm... I'm sorry. You know what?

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:34.557
You should try and get out more,
Mr Oswalt, try to clear your head.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.103
Total honesty?

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:47.396
Last night
I thought something was in the house...

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:51.987
...and I woke up on the couch
holding a baseball bat.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:58.326
Well... I guess if I thought
something was in my home at night.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.207
I'd be a little bit freaked out too.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:04.997
But, listen, Mr Oswalt,
if you sleep in this house.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.836
It's just gonna do
terrible things to your head.

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.555
TRACY: Ellison!

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.340
- Ellison!
- What's going on?

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:20.478
Your daughter thought there wasn't
room on her walls for her new painting.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.388
- Ashley!
- No, that's not it.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.683
What did we talk about?
We only gave you one rule.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:27.227
It was a big deal for us
to let you paint on your walls.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.067
- What's the rule, Ashley?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:32.231
And what makes you think
you can paint out here?

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.992
I wanted to paint her picture,
but she didn't want it in my room

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.495
because that used to be
her brother's room.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.202
What? Who are you talking about?

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:42.708
- Stephanie.
- Who's Stephanie?

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:47.418
She used to live here. She's the one
Daddy's writing his book about.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.463
Ashley, go to your room
and shut the door.

01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:06.937
What the hell were you thinking?
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:11.149
Shh. Of course I knew you were
gonna find out eventually, OK?

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:14.282
But don't blame me for not telling you.
You never wanted to know.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.908
Don't try and pin this on me.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:18.694
I asked you! I asked you
if we were living near the house!

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.115
You asked me if we were living
two houses down from a crime scene.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:23.908
- Don't you dare!
- I said no.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:26.543
- We never should have come here!
- Tracy, nobody died here.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.042
It's not like were sleeping
where somebody was killed

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.674
or they had to wipe blood
off the walls for the open house.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:35.336
- You're saying it didn't happen here?
- No. It happened in the backyard.

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:39.006
Oh, that is so sick!
God. you think that makes a difference?

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:41.471
- It does.
- No, Ellison. It doesn't.

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.682
You have done
some crazy shit in the past.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:45.391
But this definitely takes the cake.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.898
My God. what on earth
possessed you to move here?

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.480
- We've never been this broke before.
- That's no excuse.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.561
This place came on the market.
It was a steal.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.402
Gee, I wonder why.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.568
So what Trevor drew last week,
that happened here?

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.074
Yes.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:05.788
The previous owners of this home
were hung from a tree in our backyard?

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.419
- Yes.
- That is so sick. Ellison.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.921
And you let our little girl
play back there?

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.127
Why shouldn't I?

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:14.337
Our son is having night terrors

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.719
and drawing pictures
of this crime at school.

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:19.096
And our daughter just painted
a dead girl on our wall.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:21.758
She's missing.
Technically she's missing.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.302
I don't wanna hear about technicalities.

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:26.061
Do you understand
what you've done,

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.269
the kind of jeopardy you've put
your children in, your marriage?

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.523
Yes, I do!

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:34.483
Is there anything you won't do
for your goddamn book?

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:40.155
Apparently not.
I guess this is all worth it to you.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.411
- It's worth it.
- Putting your family at risk.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:45.573
- Risk of what? Of more paintings?
- Don't. Your daughter...

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.412
My daughter has a father who loves her,

01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:50.453
who is always around,
who encourages her to be herself.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.542
The worst thing
that has ever happened to her

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:55.458
is one time she moved into a house
where a family was killed.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.719
She found out about the murders,
so she felt sorry for the little girl.

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:01.175
So she painted a fucking picture!

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.808
That's what she does.
It's what she always has done.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.937
- That's it? That's all you have to say?
- What else do you want from me?

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:11.474
How about a home
where we feel safe, Ellison?

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.642
How about neighbours that don't hate us

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:17.609
in a town where I can buy groceries
without getting strange looks?

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:20.490
How about a life
that doesn't involve our kids

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:24.324
drawing and painting the sick details
of some horrific tragedy

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:27.122
or working out
their deep-seated anxieties

01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:28.908
by doing bizarre shit in the night?

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:33.045
- How about that? Would that be OK?
- I can give all that to you, I can!

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:36.798
- Just when I finish the book!
- This book isn't for us. It's for you.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:38.880
Tracy, don't say that. That's not true.

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:42.092
It is true. There are plenty of other
ways you can provide for this family.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:45.015
Doing what? Teaching?

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.723
Editing journalism textbooks?

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:54.439
Don't you understand that writing
is what gives my life meaning?

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.820

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:01.334
<i>What, do you mean literally
or in the stories?</i>

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:04.463
In the stories
if an image was destroyed,

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.130
then the gateway would be closed

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:10.294
and Bughuul would no longer
have access to this world, right?

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:15.808
<i>Mr Oswalt, what kind of book
are you writing exactly?</i>

01:33:18.301 --> 01:33:22.181
I don't know. I'm not even sure
I have a book any more.

01:33:22.388 --> 01:33:25.312
- But thank you for your time.
<i>- Anytime.</i>

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:41.582
(RINGTONE)

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:20.761
All right.

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:32.861
(RINGTONE)

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.864
- You know what time it is?
<i>- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:41.911
<i>But I've been trying
to call you all day.</i>

01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:45.035
- What's the problem?
<i>- OK, the problem is that you moved.</i>

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.958
How is that a problem?

01:35:47.116 --> 01:35:49.539
<i>I was compiling all of the data
that you had me collecting</i>

01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:52.626
<i>and once I started putting it together
into a nice readable package.</i>

01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:54.336
<i>I saw the connection, it was obvious.</i>

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:57.378
- What was it?
<i>- The dates, the addresses.</i>

01:35:57.543 --> 01:35:59.136
<i>Each family that you had me look up</i>

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:03.596
<i>had previously lived in the house where
one of the earlier murders took place.</i>

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:06.102
Each family? All five of them?

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:09.561
<i>Yes, and when you put them
in chronological order,</i>

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:12.817
<i>you can actually draw a line
from murder to murder to murder.</i>

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:15.274
<i>OK, we knew
that the Stevensons previously lived</i>

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.815
<i>in the same St Louis house
where the Millers had their throats cut,</i>

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:20.484
<i>Before the Miller family was killed,</i>

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:22.820
<i>the Millers lived in the same house
in Orange County</i>

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.114
<i>where the De Luzio
lawn massacre occurred.</i>

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.409
<i>Guess where the De Luzios lived
before they moved to Orange County?</i>

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:31.794
Sacramento where the Martinez family
was burned in their garage?

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:35.924
<i>Exactly. The pattern goes back
to the 1966 Oregon drownings.</i>

01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:39.086
<i>Listen, Mr Oswalt, you just moved out
of the last house in line.</i>

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.004
<i>If this guy is still out there,</i>

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:45.050
<i>you not only just sped up his timeline,
you put yourself in it.</i>

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:48.520
Thanks, Deputy.

01:37:29.802 --> 01:37:30.974
Stephanie.

01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:54.165
It's the missing kids.

01:38:50.633 --> 01:38:52.727
(GROANS)

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.534
I like that you made the movies longer.
They're better this way.
