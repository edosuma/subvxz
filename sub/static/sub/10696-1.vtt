00:19.183 --> 00:20.884
Ballerinas rehearse.

00:33.148 --> 00:35.715
One of them is more
than just a dancer.

00:35.748 --> 00:37.649
She's a teacher, Delphine.

00:37.682 --> 00:39.181
She scolds them.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.681
And one.

00:41.715 --> 00:43.649
And two.

00:43.682 --> 00:44.647
And three.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.348
Bleed for me, girls.

00:52.812 --> 00:53.612
I don't understand.

00:53.646 --> 00:55.312
If we're doing
fine, why do we have

00:55.345 --> 00:56.812
to run it through three times?

00:56.845 --> 00:59.012
So that the other
girls can see what

00:59.045 --> 01:00.711
professionalism looks like.

01:00.745 --> 01:02.812
Now, do it again.

01:02.844 --> 01:04.012
In that case.

01:04.046 --> 01:06.078
Saren, your
posture is terrible.

01:06.110 --> 01:07.378
Straighten up.

01:07.411 --> 01:08.878
Project.

01:08.911 --> 01:10.078
Perfect.

01:10.110 --> 01:11.845
I know you're the
teacher, Delphine,

01:11.878 --> 01:13.877
but there are a lot of
little things that you miss.

01:13.910 --> 01:16.144
That's why you're a
prima... to exercise

01:16.177 --> 01:18.244
your perfection and grace.

01:18.276 --> 01:21.876
Why are you even criticizing
us for every minor detail?

01:21.909 --> 01:23.844
Don't be offended, girl.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.743
These corrections will only
improve your performance.

01:26.775 --> 01:29.175
You must not take offense.

01:29.207 --> 01:30.309
I have a serious question.

01:30.342 --> 01:31.241
Who's playing Hilarion?

01:31.276 --> 01:33.775
From the looks of it,
no boys signed up.

01:33.808 --> 01:35.042
Simple.

01:35.075 --> 01:41.741
We draw straws, and one of you
will have to get the boy cut.

03:03.131 --> 03:05.897
I'm a little worried
about tomorrow.

03:05.929 --> 03:09.096
We've already
discussed this, Maren.

03:09.130 --> 03:12.962
Well, I would just feel
better if they found her.

03:12.996 --> 03:14.895
Well, they're bound
to any day now.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.296
We're not going to abandon our
favorite thing in the world

03:17.329 --> 03:20.096
because you're afraid the
lunatic will strike again.

03:20.128 --> 03:23.829
Don't they say the criminal
always returns to the scene.

03:23.861 --> 03:26.629
Only in real life,
not in movies.

03:26.661 --> 03:28.327
Besides, it's not like
she even killed anyone.

03:28.361 --> 03:30.161
She just injured Sylvie.

03:30.193 --> 03:34.293
And now one of us gets a
chance to play Giselle.

03:34.326 --> 03:36.661
You're right.

03:36.693 --> 03:38.993
So
You're saying I'm retired?

03:39.027 --> 03:42.226
Let's face it, Sylvie, you're
in the twilight of your career.

03:42.259 --> 03:44.225
When I walked through
your door seven years ago,

03:44.259 --> 03:46.892
you guaranteed me at least 10
years of pursuing my dream.

03:46.924 --> 03:48.791
Yes, well, seven
years ago, I didn't

03:48.825 --> 03:50.626
know that some little
17-year-old bitch

03:50.658 --> 03:53.724
with daddy issues would
come and ruin everything.

03:53.758 --> 03:54.791
You've got to do something.

03:54.825 --> 03:56.992
I can't stand by and be
replaced by these novices

03:57.025 --> 03:59.891
just because some
bitch on PCP shot me.

03:59.923 --> 04:01.091
She almost killed me.

04:01.123 --> 04:02.857
It was almost near my heart.

04:02.889 --> 04:05.023
DMT, they're now saying.

04:05.057 --> 04:05.657
What?

04:05.689 --> 04:08.823
She smoked DMT apparently.

04:08.856 --> 04:11.656
But until they find her and
grill her, it's anyone's guess.

04:11.688 --> 04:12.722
OK.

04:12.756 --> 04:14.322
Well, they need to torture
her if she won't talk.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.255
It doesn't seem to be
working with poor Ria.

04:17.286 --> 04:18.255
Poor?

04:18.288 --> 04:19.855
Wait.
I'm sorry.

04:19.887 --> 04:20.521
You don't think
that little skank

04:20.553 --> 04:21.553
had something to do with it?

04:21.587 --> 04:25.820
Hey, I'm not taking
sides, but it was her gun.

04:25.854 --> 04:27.854
Her father's rather.

04:27.886 --> 04:31.120
But they had no right to
put her in a hospital.

04:31.153 --> 04:33.886
We've all done hunger strikes.

04:33.919 --> 04:37.853
Look, I guarantee you that
whore knows where she's hiding.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.020
The law is taking care of it.

04:40.053 --> 04:42.885
Now, I hate to bring
up a sore subject,

04:42.917 --> 04:45.986
but I need you to help my
godmother pick a new lead.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.318
If she were to happen
to walk in there

04:47.351 --> 04:50.851
and see someone like the
little runt taking over,

04:50.883 --> 04:53.618
I would hate to see her rage
unfold on my security monitors.

04:56.384 --> 04:57.150
OK.

05:03.049 --> 05:05.849
Yesterday we got
three words out of you.

05:05.882 --> 05:10.648
So today, let's try for four.

05:10.681 --> 05:13.616
Ria, you must understand
that in the eye

05:13.649 --> 05:16.148
of conspiracy
theorists, you're just

05:16.180 --> 05:20.147
too good an asset in this case.

05:20.181 --> 05:23.314
Would you like to go
back to the game room?

05:23.347 --> 05:25.014
Yes.

05:25.047 --> 05:28.147
Then answer one question.

05:28.179 --> 05:30.647
Did you show Nisa
your father's weapons?

05:35.046 --> 05:39.012
Hey, Ria, do you
want to do me a favor?

05:39.044 --> 05:41.677
As long as it's not sticking
two fingers down your throat

05:41.711 --> 05:42.312
again.

05:42.345 --> 05:43.046
Exactly.

05:46.276 --> 05:49.977
Nisa, it just
doesn't feel right.

05:50.010 --> 05:50.843
They're tonsils.

05:50.877 --> 05:53.177
What are they
supposed to feel like?

05:53.210 --> 05:57.710
Can't you just gag
yourself for once?

05:57.743 --> 06:00.043
OK, fine.

06:00.076 --> 06:02.310
I see what kind
of friend you are.

06:08.674 --> 06:09.875
Nisa!

06:09.908 --> 06:12.874
Nisa, that's not the bathroom.

06:12.907 --> 06:13.874
My god!

06:13.906 --> 06:16.707
Nisa, put that down.

06:16.740 --> 06:17.807
That's my dad's secret room.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.106
You shouldn't even be in there.

06:19.140 --> 06:19.941
It should be locked.

06:19.973 --> 06:22.107
Is he preparing
for the apocalypse?

06:22.140 --> 06:22.939
Yes, obviously.

06:22.973 --> 06:23.974
Go put that back.

06:24.006 --> 06:25.906
You're gonna get me in trouble.

06:25.939 --> 06:27.906
Do you ever shoot any?

06:27.939 --> 06:30.938
There's no such thing as a
ballerina with gun training.

06:30.971 --> 06:31.871
Put it back.

06:31.905 --> 06:32.639
Come on.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.738
Maybe we should go visit her.

06:38.770 --> 06:39.837
Ria?

06:39.870 --> 06:40.837
Yeah, who else?

06:40.871 --> 06:44.038
I'm not about to go to
some mental institution.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.770
It's not like you'd
have to go play

06:45.804 --> 06:47.203
kickball with all the crazies.

06:47.237 --> 06:49.237
We would just be
showing her support.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.303
Support?

06:50.336 --> 06:52.737
I'm not even convinced
that she wasn't in on it.

06:52.769 --> 06:53.902
Come on.

06:53.935 --> 06:54.935
She was sweeter than me.

06:54.968 --> 06:56.369
Which isn't saying much.

06:56.402 --> 06:57.970
Hey, guys, I think
they just posted.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.302
Really?

06:59.335 --> 07:00.202
I really don't want to see it.

07:00.234 --> 07:01.101
Come on.

07:01.134 --> 07:02.901
As long as I don't
have to be Giselle.

07:02.935 --> 07:03.569
What?

07:03.603 --> 07:05.035
What are you talking about?

07:05.068 --> 07:06.368
Every girl wants that role.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.367
Seriously.

07:07.401 --> 07:09.001
I mean, it does not get
much better than that.

07:09.034 --> 07:11.901
Yeah, if you're
an attention whore.

07:11.934 --> 07:14.801
Which, my god,
I guess you are.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.901
My god, you're hilarious.

07:16.934 --> 07:19.267
But really, it would mean a lot
to me knowing I was the best.

07:19.299 --> 07:22.232
Well, you guys are just lucky,
because even though I'm just

07:22.265 --> 07:24.133
as small, I have the biggest
boobs and the chubbiest cheeks,

07:24.165 --> 07:25.832
which will probably
never leave me.

07:25.866 --> 07:26.499
You do not.

07:26.532 --> 07:28.031
My god, you're so pretty.

07:28.065 --> 07:29.199
Stop, you're upsetting me.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.864
Look, you'd be just as good
of a Giselle as her or me.

07:32.897 --> 07:33.699
Yes.

07:33.732 --> 07:34.332
You're right.

07:34.364 --> 07:35.997
Let's go.

07:36.030 --> 07:38.631
Ballerinas
scramble to the bulletin board.

07:40.130 --> 07:40.964
Damn it.

07:40.997 --> 07:42.797
It isn't me.

07:42.831 --> 07:44.129
Then it must be me.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.830
Don't be so full of yourself.

07:46.862 --> 07:48.164
It is me.

07:48.197 --> 07:50.096
Yeah, just because
they needed somebody.

07:50.129 --> 07:51.263
I bet they hate us all.

07:51.295 --> 07:54.263
Hey, don't burst
your bubble, Saren.

07:54.296 --> 07:56.596
If it were me,
you'd be grateful.

07:56.628 --> 07:58.062
I'm a throwaway
character, as always.

07:58.094 --> 07:59.962
It says "to be decided."

08:00.827 --> 08:02.028
Well, don't feel bad.

08:02.061 --> 08:04.994
At least no one will write about
you in the community flyer.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.627
Your shy kind couldn't
handle criticism.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.194
I can handle the limelight.

08:09.226 --> 08:11.160
You know, honestly,
we all thought

08:11.193 --> 08:13.659
you'd play the dude because
you're least likely to mind

08:13.693 --> 08:14.326
dressing like a boy.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.193
Shut up.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.694
You know, your
gayness doesn't show.

08:16.726 --> 08:18.625
I am not a lesbian, OK?

08:18.658 --> 08:23.625
I'm technically selectively
bi-curious and semi-bi-active

08:23.658 --> 08:24.258
when I'm drunk.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.958
Yeah, OK.

08:27.991 --> 08:32.123
I want to share
a needle with you.

08:32.157 --> 08:33.056
Why?

08:33.090 --> 08:34.957
I thought you only
liked to use clean ones.

08:37.823 --> 08:38.691
That's not as romantic.

08:41.888 --> 08:42.922
Fine.

08:42.956 --> 08:47.156
I'll share one with you
as long as I can go first.

08:47.188 --> 08:48.188
Why?

08:48.221 --> 08:50.288
What's that about?

08:50.321 --> 08:54.287
Well, you're the
one who's asking.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.287
You want it, you risk it.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.220
Shit.

08:59.255 --> 09:04.154
Are you afraid of
catching my disease?

09:04.187 --> 09:06.820
You're crazy enough to shoot
up a happy farm of ballet girls.

09:06.853 --> 09:08.587
What's to say you're
not a whore too?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.085
That's how you're speaking
to your girlfriend now.

09:15.119 --> 09:15.886
No.

09:15.919 --> 09:17.886
That's how I speak
to a fugitive.

09:17.919 --> 09:20.218
I can talk to you
any way I want to.

09:20.251 --> 09:22.085
It doesn't matter
if you do fuck me.

09:25.218 --> 09:28.251
Which I... I won't anymore.

09:28.283 --> 09:29.483
Yes, you will.

09:29.517 --> 09:32.950
I'm not harboring a fugitive
and getting nothing in return.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.285
Don't leave me high and dry.

09:37.148 --> 09:39.915
You know, why don't we
focus on the high part?

09:39.948 --> 09:41.715
Then we'll see about
leaving you dry or not.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.211
If you can tell
us everything we

10:13.245 --> 10:20.211
need to know, I can help you
make your old life new again,

10:20.243 --> 10:26.577
or your new life old again...
However you want to look at it.

10:26.611 --> 10:28.578
I want to go back
to the ballet.

10:31.242 --> 10:33.275
Hey, now!

10:33.309 --> 10:36.176
That's eight words.

10:36.209 --> 10:37.209
We are making progress.

10:40.109 --> 10:43.576
She tried to kill me.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.741
I thought she liked you.

10:45.773 --> 10:47.007
Were you not best friends?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.774
We were.

10:48.807 --> 10:51.907
Up until my lingerie party.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.073
Go on.

10:54.107 --> 10:55.607
All the girls lounge

10:55.640 --> 10:58.306
around in their lingerie.

11:24.270 --> 11:27.670
So Samuel, what's
your essay about?

11:27.702 --> 11:29.802
I suppose the
concise explanation would

11:29.836 --> 11:34.169
be my self-discovered notion
that a painting is not

11:34.202 --> 11:37.303
painted by an artist but
rather an artist paints

11:37.335 --> 11:39.102
that which is a painting.

11:39.835 --> 11:43.935
I don't really understand.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.267
I was about to shoot this.

11:46.301 --> 11:47.101
That whole thing?

11:48.134 --> 11:49.801
That's a huge shot.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.100
Split it with me.

11:51.132 --> 11:53.266
OK.

11:53.299 --> 11:54.233
Hey, what's going on there?

11:54.267 --> 11:55.699
Can I get some?

11:55.732 --> 11:56.266
No.

12:02.265 --> 12:03.133
I can't believe you.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.299
You know who that was?

12:04.332 --> 12:05.132
Yeah.

12:05.164 --> 12:06.264
Faggoty Don Elsoroy.

12:06.297 --> 12:08.265
I hate him.

12:08.298 --> 12:09.965
You hate any guy
who's clean cut.

12:09.998 --> 12:11.698
Well, can I help
it if I only like

12:11.730 --> 12:14.130
tall, skinny guys with tattoos?

12:14.163 --> 12:18.164
In layman's terms, your
creation should be your bitch.

12:18.897 --> 12:22.297
That's, really interesting.

12:22.330 --> 12:25.297
So, do you want to make out?

12:25.329 --> 12:26.562
No.

12:26.596 --> 12:32.262
I find making out to be rather
mundane and counterproductive.

12:32.295 --> 12:34.728
So, do you want to make out?

12:34.760 --> 12:35.295
If you insist.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.793
What is that?

12:45.826 --> 12:46.694
It's nothing.

12:51.626 --> 12:54.993
"Chapter four, Chloe
takes her ballet shoes off

12:55.026 --> 12:56.826
and rubs her heels and toes.

12:56.858 --> 12:59.225
Her face contorts to the
usual expression given when

12:59.258 --> 13:02.658
pain or pleasure is felt.
For such an unusual girl,

13:02.691 --> 13:05.158
the two feelings were
perhaps one and the same.

13:05.191 --> 13:07.025
But how could she
complain after the killing

13:07.057 --> 13:08.890
that she committed?"

13:08.924 --> 13:11.224
What the hell is that?

13:11.257 --> 13:13.290
It's homework.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.723
You're not making eye contact.

13:15.756 --> 13:16.823
You're a lying bitch.

13:16.856 --> 13:19.723
Well, only my sister knows.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.188
I made her swear
not to tell anyone.

13:21.222 --> 13:23.656
Tell anyone what?

13:23.689 --> 13:26.156
I'm sort of an
aspiring novelist.

13:26.189 --> 13:27.556
I have three books already.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.155
For YA.

13:29.188 --> 13:30.222
YA?

13:30.255 --> 13:32.688
Young adults.

13:52.284 --> 13:54.753
I hope practice doesn't
run late again today.

13:54.786 --> 13:56.553
I have things to do.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.252
Yeah, like what?

13:58.284 --> 14:00.184
Or people to do.

14:00.217 --> 14:01.585
Either one.

14:01.618 --> 14:03.285
You mean Conway?

14:03.318 --> 14:04.485
Maybe.

14:04.517 --> 14:07.250
My gosh, you definitely
are going to hang out with him.

14:07.283 --> 14:07.883
Well...

14:07.916 --> 14:09.016
I can see it on your face.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.216
I don't see why Nisa keeps
getting so mad about that.

14:11.249 --> 14:14.149
It's not like she
hasn't cheated on him.

14:14.183 --> 14:15.216
Everybody knows she has.

14:15.249 --> 14:16.050
Yeah.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.117
So what's the big deal?

14:17.149 --> 14:18.649
She needs to relax.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.282
It's not like she has to
find out about it though.

14:21.315 --> 14:22.249
Yeah, exactly.

14:22.283 --> 14:24.882
Maybe we can just keep
it a little secret.

14:24.915 --> 14:26.215
Deal.

14:26.247 --> 14:27.649
Speaking of relax,
why is Delphine

14:27.682 --> 14:28.881
always so wound up in a ball?

14:28.914 --> 14:32.047
My god, she's such a cow.

14:32.081 --> 14:32.948
I hate her.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.580
I hate her.

14:34.613 --> 14:36.913
She always makes me tie
up my boobs, and it hurts.

14:36.946 --> 14:38.146
I don't want to do it anymore.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.712
-Then don't.
-I won't.

14:39.745 --> 14:40.712
Because I don't.

14:40.745 --> 14:42.579
I mean, I don't do
anything I'm told though.

14:42.612 --> 14:43.579
You're such a rebel.

14:43.612 --> 14:44.212
I know.

14:44.245 --> 14:45.878
I'm such a brat.

14:45.911 --> 14:46.811
Whatever.

14:46.846 --> 14:50.245
I'm about done with
this company anyway.

14:50.277 --> 14:51.078
We both are.

14:51.111 --> 14:52.010
Yeah, seriously.

14:52.044 --> 14:54.044
We have so much more
to look forward to.

14:54.077 --> 14:55.245
Yeah, screw this place.

15:17.641 --> 15:20.241
Can you knock it off?

15:20.274 --> 15:22.574
I have to write.

15:22.607 --> 15:24.641
I can't believe it's
out that you're writing

15:24.675 --> 15:27.173
a story based on what happened.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.641
It's not such a big deal.

15:29.674 --> 15:31.274
I mean, no one has
made a big deal

15:31.307 --> 15:33.906
about the potential
controversy on or offline yet.

15:33.939 --> 15:35.240
What about Sylvie?

15:35.273 --> 15:38.207
What's she gonna say
when she finds out?

15:38.239 --> 15:41.171
She's not gonna know
it's about her really.

15:41.205 --> 15:43.606
You start off your
first chapter by a prima

15:43.639 --> 15:45.705
ballerina getting attacked.

15:45.738 --> 15:47.106
How is that subtle?

15:47.138 --> 15:48.337
I altered things in the book.

15:48.371 --> 15:51.604
Like, they're doing just act
two of "Giselle," not both acts

15:51.637 --> 15:52.404
like we're doing.

15:52.438 --> 15:54.637
And the killer
ballerina actually

15:54.671 --> 15:58.638
kills people, not just wounds
them like in the real story.

15:58.671 --> 16:01.570
You're gonna wish she had
been killed when she finds out.

16:01.602 --> 16:04.636
An author like me
can write whatever.

16:04.669 --> 16:06.602
True events are turned
into stories all the time.

16:06.635 --> 16:12.301
You just have to change names
and certain circumstances.

16:12.334 --> 16:14.302
You just gave me an idea.

16:14.335 --> 16:16.701
What if one of the ballerina
who survives the attacks goes

16:16.733 --> 16:19.001
on to publish a book about it?

16:19.034 --> 16:23.634
I mean, then it would
be a book within a book.

16:23.668 --> 16:24.901
Mind-boggling.

16:24.934 --> 16:28.534
Well, you should try typing on
a laptop like a normal person.

16:28.566 --> 16:31.165
The aesthetic of
the vintage typewriter

16:31.198 --> 16:34.032
is way better than some
stupid laptop with a sticker

16:34.065 --> 16:36.698
covering the logo.

16:36.731 --> 16:39.231
It has come to my
attention that one of you

16:39.265 --> 16:43.697
has had the audacity
to construct satire...

16:43.731 --> 16:48.565
More specifically a manuscript
for a cheap paperback novel...

16:48.597 --> 16:50.730
Detailing my life's hardships.

16:50.763 --> 16:54.663
Hardships you all know,
and I don't appreciate it.

16:54.696 --> 16:57.962
Now, I don't expect such
said person to come forward,

16:57.995 --> 16:59.729
and I don't want them to.

16:59.762 --> 17:02.595
Because I already
know who it is.

17:02.628 --> 17:06.262
I do expect for them to
find it in their tiny hearts

17:06.296 --> 17:10.061
that one ounce of decency that
their mother instilled in them

17:10.094 --> 17:14.727
and destroy any and all pages
of this despicable story.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.527
And that's all I have
to say about that.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.528
Thank you, Sylvie,
for the announcements.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.692
I have a few announcements
I'd like to add,

17:22.724 --> 17:25.526
starting with the
least important.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.260
Whoever has been posting lesbian
innuendos on the bulletin

17:29.292 --> 17:32.892
upfront is not only
extremely immature,

17:32.925 --> 17:36.858
but in-professionalism
will not be tolerated here.

17:36.891 --> 17:39.525
Unprofessionalism?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.958
You said in-professionalism.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.223
Thank you, Gabriella.

17:43.256 --> 17:46.724
When you reach the position I
have worked for my whole life,

17:46.757 --> 17:49.590
you can make up
whatever word you like.

17:49.623 --> 17:53.523
Yes, I too was a
prima ballerina once.

17:57.323 --> 18:00.222
And now, for the
final memo to you all,

18:00.255 --> 18:04.855
the student... ex-student
who's responsible

18:04.887 --> 18:07.721
for the horrific events
that have occurred here

18:07.755 --> 18:08.622
remains at large.

18:11.887 --> 18:15.687
The only reason we had to fire
the handsome security guards

18:15.719 --> 18:17.621
is because the
money your parents

18:17.653 --> 18:20.752
give us isn't enough to
afford them any longer.

18:20.785 --> 18:23.652
The amendment we created stands.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.619
There will be no
mention of the incident

18:26.652 --> 18:31.985
to ensure that the prestigious
honor and legacy of this school

18:32.019 --> 18:34.950
never dies.

18:34.984 --> 18:36.652
I may have to
leave the company.

18:36.684 --> 18:37.484
Why?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.084
Because my
dad got all freaked

18:39.117 --> 18:40.718
out when the shooting happened.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.750
What am I going
to do without you?

18:42.784 --> 18:43.650
You'll figure it out.

18:43.683 --> 18:44.783
No, I won't.

18:44.815 --> 18:45.749
These girls are idiots.

18:45.782 --> 18:47.083
I can't survive them by myself.

18:47.117 --> 18:48.084
I know.

18:48.116 --> 18:49.950
And I'm pissed because I
just got the lead role.

18:49.982 --> 18:52.216
And now what?

18:52.248 --> 18:53.681
Don't go.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.915
Well, I'm actually
90% sure I got accepted

18:56.949 --> 18:58.649
to a highly coveted academy.

18:58.681 --> 18:59.282
You're kidding.

18:59.315 --> 19:00.781
Way better than this one.

19:00.813 --> 19:02.215
I'm so jealous.

19:02.247 --> 19:03.248
You should just come.

19:03.282 --> 19:03.915
You know what?

19:03.948 --> 19:05.780
Maybe I will come with you.

19:05.814 --> 19:06.882
We should just do it together.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.113
Stop!

19:24.112 --> 19:28.279
Well, Ria, much as I would like
to grant the freedom you wish

19:28.312 --> 19:31.778
for, there's still an upset
at the school of ballet

19:31.810 --> 19:33.810
you wish to return to.

19:33.843 --> 19:38.511
Your instructors there feel you
must, in one way or another,

19:38.543 --> 19:39.110
have been involved.

19:41.976 --> 19:45.010
And until we can
prove otherwise,

19:45.043 --> 19:47.109
you're going to have
to make yourself

19:47.142 --> 19:50.676
feel more at home here.

19:50.708 --> 19:55.108
Something tells me you're
closing your shell on me again.

19:55.141 --> 19:59.040
You don't kill the messengers.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.842
Perhaps that was a
poor choice of words.

20:06.039 --> 20:12.205
So if you will just sign,
or rather initial here,

20:12.239 --> 20:17.806
we can start seeing you get
out of this room at least.

20:17.839 --> 20:21.739
Begin field program
A, and if you do well,

20:21.771 --> 20:27.104
retire to field program B,
which is much less work.

20:27.138 --> 20:31.769
We might even have you in this
beautiful state park on litter

20:31.803 --> 20:36.704
duty, much better than being
cooped in here all day,

20:36.736 --> 20:37.704
I can assure you.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.470
Here.

20:42.869 --> 20:43.602
Sign.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.625
I kinda wish they had
those massage therapists

22:08.659 --> 22:10.892
like they do at the pro level.

22:10.925 --> 22:12.925
You know, that's
what they should

22:12.957 --> 22:14.824
have had those security
boys doing instead

22:14.857 --> 22:17.957
of just standing there all day.

22:17.990 --> 22:20.957
Sucks to be someone.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.224
You know, I think
Sophie is just using

22:23.257 --> 22:25.858
it as an outlet for her anger.

22:25.891 --> 22:27.822
I mean, let the dreamer dream.

22:27.856 --> 22:29.857
It's not like she got a
tattoo on her chest of the bag

22:29.889 --> 22:31.822
in a sling.

22:31.856 --> 22:37.223
You know, I kinda want to read
the book when... if... she rebels

22:37.255 --> 22:40.121
and decides to finish it.

22:40.154 --> 22:42.488
Hey, Maren, we want
to read your book.

22:42.522 --> 22:43.955
Did you turn us into characters?

22:43.987 --> 22:46.155
I think I've had enough
emotional abuse for one day.

22:46.187 --> 22:47.120
You're teasing me.

22:47.154 --> 22:48.386
It's really lame.

22:48.420 --> 22:52.120
Seriously, you guys, she's not
continuing it, unfortunately.

22:52.152 --> 22:54.153
And it's sad, because it
probably would have been

22:54.186 --> 22:55.854
a "New York Times" Bestseller.

22:55.886 --> 23:00.119
We just want to know if
you wrote about us in it.

23:00.151 --> 23:02.085
Well, at least
tell me how it ends.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.786
I mean, does the slut get
locked away for her crimes?

23:04.819 --> 23:07.652
And what about the back story?

23:07.684 --> 23:08.951
What made her snap?

23:08.985 --> 23:09.952
Lots of reasons.

23:09.985 --> 23:11.917
Pain builds up inside her.

23:11.951 --> 23:13.685
Buy the book when I'm done.

23:13.718 --> 23:14.452
Bitch.

23:21.916 --> 23:22.817
Delphine?

23:22.849 --> 23:23.982
Yes.
Nisa.

23:24.016 --> 23:24.949
Come in.

23:24.982 --> 23:26.483
You wanted to see me.

23:26.516 --> 23:27.850
I did.

23:27.882 --> 23:28.816
I'm concerned about you.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.914
What about?

23:34.948 --> 23:38.682
Is it my arch or my allergies?

23:38.714 --> 23:39.514
No.

23:39.548 --> 23:40.881
Your dancing's fine.

23:40.913 --> 23:43.948
It's your bust and your
waistline that isn't.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.179
Aren't you glad I
told you in private?

23:52.212 --> 23:56.528
I mean, I could have made a fat
list and put your name on it.

23:56.529 --> 23:59.812
You'd be the only one.

23:59.844 --> 24:00.945
Yes.

24:00.978 --> 24:02.946
Thank you for not embarrassing
me in front of class,

24:02.978 --> 24:07.479
but I'm only six pounds
heavier than last season.

24:07.511 --> 24:10.610
Shame weighs about
six pounds, Nisa.

24:15.776 --> 24:16.810
Yes, Delphine.

24:16.843 --> 24:18.810
I'll correct this at once.

24:18.842 --> 24:22.741
I don't think you can without
getting a breast reduction,

24:22.775 --> 24:24.676
and those are expensive.

24:24.709 --> 24:26.209
Will Daddy buy?

24:26.243 --> 24:28.876
Will Daddy need to know?

24:28.908 --> 24:31.008
You're not even
taping them down.

24:31.040 --> 24:35.475
They're literally popping
right our of your leotard.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.907
I'm just happy your ass
hasn't followed suit.

24:41.739 --> 24:43.506
What are you getting at?

24:43.540 --> 24:46.040
I'm just giving
you an inspection.

24:46.072 --> 24:50.072
Do you mind?

24:50.105 --> 24:52.605
No.

24:52.639 --> 24:59.904
Just I don't want you to get
the wrong idea or impression.

24:59.938 --> 25:01.672
I'm not going to let you go.

25:01.705 --> 25:05.604
You're indeed a vital
asset to this company.

25:05.636 --> 25:11.204
But don't let your ass
get as big as mine.

25:11.236 --> 25:13.136
No.

25:13.169 --> 25:14.735
It won't.

25:14.769 --> 25:16.002
What are you saying?

25:16.036 --> 25:18.637
It's shamefully big, isn't it?

25:22.034 --> 25:23.735
Love me or leave the company.

25:35.566 --> 25:36.167
Nisa.

25:36.199 --> 25:37.567
Don't touch me.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.467
Nisa, it's me.

25:38.501 --> 25:39.034
What's wrong?

25:41.967 --> 25:42.934
Just leave me alone.

25:42.967 --> 25:43.766
Stop.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.667
What is it this time?

25:49.031 --> 25:54.599
Just... I'm disgustingly
fat and fucked up

25:54.630 --> 25:58.097
and I fucking hate this place.

25:58.131 --> 25:59.932
Did Brandon text
you that shit again?

26:03.231 --> 26:07.664
It's that dyke Delphine.

26:07.697 --> 26:08.497
What'd she do?

26:08.529 --> 26:09.795
I hate her.

26:09.829 --> 26:10.597
What'd she do?

26:13.163 --> 26:14.796
-Come here, baby.
-I don't want to say.

26:14.828 --> 26:18.928
-Just...
-Baby!

26:18.962 --> 26:22.062
Hey, you are never going to
guess what my mom just told me.

26:22.095 --> 26:23.161
What?

26:23.193 --> 26:26.194
She just got a call from
Saren and Maren's crazy dad.

26:26.227 --> 26:27.128
Bitch broke out.

26:27.160 --> 26:27.927
Ria?

26:27.960 --> 26:28.993
Yeah.

26:29.026 --> 26:30.060
She broke out of
the institution?

26:30.094 --> 26:30.961
Yep.

26:30.993 --> 26:31.894
How?

26:31.926 --> 26:32.893
I don't know.

26:32.926 --> 26:36.193
But she also apparently
assaulted the warden.

26:36.226 --> 26:37.459
Really?

26:37.493 --> 26:39.093
Hardcore.

26:39.126 --> 26:41.125
So I guess both the crazies
are on the loose now.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.758
How does such a
pathetic little girl

26:43.792 --> 26:46.091
break out of an institution.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.059
She probably ran off
when they let her outside

26:48.091 --> 26:49.257
to pee or something.

26:49.290 --> 26:53.091
So she's got the darkness
of the night on her side now.

26:53.123 --> 26:55.090
Where do you think she's headed?

26:55.124 --> 26:56.091
I don't know.

26:56.124 --> 26:57.858
She doesn't know where I
live, unless she's been

26:57.891 --> 26:59.090
here for a party or something.

26:59.123 --> 27:01.989
Besides, the neighborhood watch
force would apprehend anyone

27:02.023 --> 27:03.990
they saw in a prison jumpsuit.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.922
This is upper-class
suburbia at its finest.

27:06.956 --> 27:08.989
What if she did
show up here, though?

27:09.022 --> 27:09.956
I mean, would you let
her chill with us?

27:09.988 --> 27:10.988
What?

27:11.022 --> 27:13.122
We all used to be friends.

27:13.155 --> 27:15.921
It's not like we know
she's guilty of anything.

27:15.954 --> 27:17.654
Besides, being
friends with her...

27:17.688 --> 27:19.655
No, it's way deeper than that.

27:19.687 --> 27:20.987
We can't be affiliated
with convicts

27:21.021 --> 27:23.886
if we expect to maintain
our hierarchy at this school

27:23.920 --> 27:26.986
and be besties all through
our experience governing

27:27.019 --> 27:30.619
the sorority next semester.

27:52.550 --> 27:53.850
Hey, are you OK?

27:53.883 --> 27:54.783
Yeah.

27:54.817 --> 27:55.982
Here.
My god.

27:56.015 --> 27:56.882
Here, have some water.

27:56.915 --> 27:59.083
I must have... I must
have over-heated.

27:59.115 --> 28:00.150
Geez, no wonder.

28:00.182 --> 28:01.949
You're wearing long sleeves.

28:01.983 --> 28:06.516
It... it was cold when
I set out this morning.

28:06.548 --> 28:08.748
OK, do you live around here?

28:08.782 --> 28:09.582
Yeah, right here.

28:09.614 --> 28:10.715
Right near here.

28:10.747 --> 28:12.880
OK, let me walk you home.

28:12.914 --> 28:13.714
It's OK.

28:13.747 --> 28:14.481
I'm too tired.

28:14.514 --> 28:15.147
But thank you.

28:15.181 --> 28:16.148
Thank you.

28:16.181 --> 28:18.747
No, you need a... it's...
I live around here too.

28:18.781 --> 28:19.882
We should be running buddies.

28:23.047 --> 28:24.147
Sure.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.480
Sure, yeah.

28:26.513 --> 28:28.146
So, are you in school?

28:28.178 --> 28:30.079
Yeah, I'm a senior.

28:30.111 --> 28:31.045
OK.

28:31.078 --> 28:32.479
I graduated last year.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.212
Cool.

28:33.246 --> 28:34.013
Cool.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.845
Do you have any
plans for college?

28:37.877 --> 28:39.744
I'm an aspiring dancer.

28:39.778 --> 28:40.577
Cool.

28:40.611 --> 28:41.278
Cool.

28:41.311 --> 28:42.044
What kind of dance do you do?

28:42.077 --> 28:43.477
Jazz?
Hip-hop?

28:43.510 --> 28:44.044
Tap?

28:47.777 --> 28:48.844
I'm so sorry.

28:48.876 --> 28:50.010
Can you grab that?

28:50.044 --> 28:50.844
Yeah.

28:50.876 --> 28:51.576
No worries.

29:02.641 --> 29:05.141
I'm a ballerina!

29:05.174 --> 29:07.209
But the bottom
line is, I can't

29:07.241 --> 29:09.008
give out any more scholarships.

29:09.042 --> 29:11.175
The institution is
losing its funding.

29:11.207 --> 29:14.673
In 2002, we brought in over
300,000 on tuitions alone.

29:14.707 --> 29:15.841
I remember.

29:15.874 --> 29:17.673
With all these other
schools popping up,

29:17.707 --> 29:19.072
now there's a competition.

29:19.106 --> 29:20.940
They've got lower
fees, and they're

29:20.973 --> 29:23.773
even supplying their girls
with leotards, shoes.

29:23.806 --> 29:25.940
I mean, is that something
that you're willing to do?

29:25.972 --> 29:28.605
Not to mention your
prestigious ballet school

29:28.639 --> 29:31.173
is teaching classes at
somebody's apartment.

29:35.772 --> 29:37.105
I'll tell you
what I'm not going

29:37.138 --> 29:40.971
to do... let some mental
case ruin my career.

29:41.003 --> 29:43.903
She already ruined Sylvie's.

29:43.937 --> 29:47.204
Is it bad timing to
host another fundraiser?

29:47.236 --> 29:49.836
I mean, we made decent
money at the last pig roast.

29:56.101 --> 29:57.735
This is part of the problem.

29:57.769 --> 30:00.069
You wake up every day at noon,
and you're drinking by noon-30.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.468
Maybe if you had half
the responsibility I do,

30:06.500 --> 30:09.933
you'd suffer from a mild
case of alcoholism too.

30:09.967 --> 30:13.100
I know you have a high profile
reputation to maintain and all,

30:13.134 --> 30:15.066
but I think it's
really important

30:15.098 --> 30:17.433
to give more than half
your girls scholarships,

30:17.467 --> 30:19.800
considering the facts.

30:19.832 --> 30:21.965
So we are in agreeance then.

30:21.999 --> 30:25.132
It's only our paralyzed
prima we have to convince.

30:25.164 --> 30:27.131
Or do we?

30:27.165 --> 30:30.432
I've been thinking about
terminating her altogether.

30:30.464 --> 30:32.963
She has no reason
to stay with us.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.731
She's useless to us if she
can't be in the next production.

30:35.764 --> 30:38.497
And Delphine's said
to me time and time

30:38.530 --> 30:40.897
again she steps on her toes.

30:40.930 --> 30:42.464
If you think you
can handle the added

30:42.497 --> 30:45.197
hell of her backlash
misunderstandings,

30:45.229 --> 30:47.629
then sure, go for it.

30:47.663 --> 30:49.129
She probably still
thinks she's the lead.

30:49.162 --> 30:50.796
She'll go on even
with the sling.

30:50.828 --> 30:51.661
You know her.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.761
What time's lunch?

30:56.795 --> 30:58.495
11.

30:58.528 --> 30:59.629
How long till then?

30:59.661 --> 31:02.461
Like, two hours.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.161
You know, I'm
really proud of you

31:04.194 --> 31:06.027
for standing up for
yourself back there.

31:06.059 --> 31:06.859
Really?

31:07.726 --> 31:10.927
Girls, less talking,
more dancing.

31:10.959 --> 31:14.958
And Maren, potty now so you
don't have to ask me later.

31:14.991 --> 31:16.092
I have a bladder condition.

31:16.125 --> 31:19.792
Not even baby ballerinas
wear diapers under their tutu.

31:23.558 --> 31:25.690
She needs a broomstick.

31:25.724 --> 31:26.625
Tell me about it.

31:40.855 --> 31:45.956
There you go again, putting
all your weight on it.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.455
The bar is supposed to be
treated like a partner,

31:48.489 --> 31:50.156
remember?

31:50.189 --> 31:51.988
Not completely rely on it.

31:52.022 --> 31:55.054
I'm so tired.

31:55.087 --> 31:58.954
I can't stand how long
and hard she works us.

31:58.987 --> 32:01.788
This is only half
as bad as the pros.

32:01.821 --> 32:04.454
You should start taking the
medication I switched to.

32:04.486 --> 32:08.452
It makes it so I feel the
ache in all my muscles,

32:08.486 --> 32:11.787
but it doesn't translate
to emotional agony.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.185
Sounds poetic.

32:13.219 --> 32:15.852
Let me get your doctor's number.

32:15.884 --> 32:18.986
It's great, but it
doesn't stave off hunger

32:19.018 --> 32:20.451
like the last pill I was taking.

32:23.184 --> 32:26.583
I asked him if I could take
both, but he said, not likely.

32:26.617 --> 32:29.451
Should I try it?

32:29.484 --> 32:30.417
I guess.

32:30.451 --> 32:32.917
Just stop before it
turns you into a zombie.

32:38.515 --> 32:40.816
You danced really well today.

32:40.848 --> 32:41.748
Thanks.

32:41.781 --> 32:43.516
What makes you say that?

32:43.548 --> 32:44.715
You never compliment me.

32:44.748 --> 32:47.181
Yes I do.

32:47.214 --> 32:48.514
Just take it.

32:48.548 --> 32:49.682
You're getting better.

32:49.714 --> 32:52.515
I'm afraid your skill level
is going to surpass mine.

32:52.547 --> 32:54.581
Well, then you better
stop spending so much time

32:54.613 --> 32:57.013
on your novelist fantasies
and start spending a little

32:57.047 --> 32:59.913
more time at the gym with me.

32:59.947 --> 33:03.547
As soon as I'm done with the
story, I'll give writing up.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.679
Or at least until
this season's over.

33:05.712 --> 33:07.479
When are you going to be done?

33:07.511 --> 33:08.578
Do you have an ending yet?

33:08.612 --> 33:11.413
I have a few I'm
mentally toying with.

33:11.446 --> 33:12.878
I just have to give
up this cheap desire

33:12.912 --> 33:15.479
to satisfy the reader with
some dumb happy ending.

33:22.577 --> 33:23.178
What was that?

33:23.211 --> 33:24.544
Maren!

33:24.576 --> 33:25.111
Saren!

33:28.444 --> 33:29.910
Ria, what the hell...

33:29.943 --> 33:31.576
Please help me!

33:31.608 --> 33:33.175
You're not allowed here.

33:33.209 --> 33:34.943
And we're not allowed
to talk to you either.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.741
Props on breaking out.

33:39.774 --> 33:40.908
Yeah.

33:40.942 --> 33:41.975
How'd that go?

33:42.007 --> 33:44.041
I'll explain everything later.

33:44.073 --> 33:46.440
The main thing is I'm innocent.

33:46.474 --> 33:48.875
I had no idea what
Nisa was up to.

33:48.907 --> 33:50.973
I know she expressed
anger towards Sylvie,

33:51.007 --> 33:54.540
but I never took her
death threats seriously.

33:54.572 --> 33:56.539
You have to believe me.

33:56.572 --> 33:57.339
I'm on the run now.

33:57.373 --> 34:01.407
Can you just hide
me and feed me.

34:01.439 --> 34:02.505
We're good girls.

34:02.539 --> 34:06.605
Remember, you're what people
refer to as a bad girl.

34:06.638 --> 34:09.505
Can you just tell
me where she is?

34:09.539 --> 34:10.571
Like we know.

34:10.603 --> 34:12.105
No idea?

34:12.138 --> 34:14.737
If she was smart, she would
have already left the country.

34:14.770 --> 34:17.469
They probably will want to lock
her up for, like, five years,

34:17.503 --> 34:19.569
let alone not being
able to dance a ballet,

34:19.603 --> 34:23.737
with ours or any other company
from now until eternity.

34:23.768 --> 34:27.603
Please, can't you just throw me
down a fruit bar or something?

34:27.636 --> 34:29.735
I'm starving.

34:29.768 --> 34:30.835
It's a starving art.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.667
You know she's
still working on her book.

34:39.701 --> 34:41.168
I don't care anymore.

34:41.201 --> 34:45.500
I'm more concerned about
Nisa and Ria on the loose.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.934
What if they try and hurt us?

34:46.966 --> 34:48.565
Why would they?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.565
Because they're both psycho.

34:51.598 --> 34:54.167
Yeah, but we're not the
ones that should be worried.

35:09.197 --> 35:10.930
Apparently there's
no more wine.

35:10.963 --> 35:11.863
There's no more wine?

35:11.897 --> 35:13.463
Yeah, Ainsley drank
it all, that bitch.

35:13.496 --> 35:13.997
She drank it all?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.197
I don't believe her.

35:15.230 --> 35:17.663
Anyway, yeah, this is the
last, so I can get you a glass.

35:17.696 --> 35:19.529
Maybe we just have
some mutual friends.

35:19.563 --> 35:20.764
I'm sure we do.

35:20.796 --> 35:21.596
Yeah.

35:21.630 --> 35:22.630
What do you do?

35:22.662 --> 35:23.662
I dance.

35:23.694 --> 35:24.529
You do?

35:24.561 --> 35:25.495
Like on...
Ballet.

35:25.529 --> 35:25.996
Ballet?

35:26.029 --> 35:27.795
-Yeah.
-Nice.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.395
I was gonna say pole, but that
would have been rude, right?

35:29.429 --> 35:31.095
Yeah.

35:31.128 --> 35:34.595
You can give me a
glass, but I think you can

35:34.628 --> 35:36.528
slow down yourself,
because you're wearing

35:36.561 --> 35:37.527
someone's hamster on...

35:37.560 --> 35:38.695
This is mine.

35:38.727 --> 35:40.494
Now we might have
to hang out more.

35:40.528 --> 35:41.493
Maybe so.

35:41.526 --> 35:43.793
I don't know if it will
be over ballet, but...

35:43.826 --> 35:45.127
Yeah.

35:45.159 --> 35:46.794
So anyway, how are you?

35:46.827 --> 35:48.426
What's going on?

35:48.459 --> 35:49.393
You look hot.

35:49.427 --> 35:49.860
I look hot?

35:49.892 --> 35:50.393
You look hot.

35:50.425 --> 35:51.692
You never look hot.

35:51.725 --> 35:52.525
What's going on?

35:52.559 --> 35:53.159
College?

35:53.192 --> 35:53.992
High school.

35:54.024 --> 35:55.692
What?

35:55.726 --> 35:56.526
No.

35:56.559 --> 35:58.024
Yeah.

35:58.058 --> 35:59.959
So yeah, it's, like,
real cool of you

35:59.991 --> 36:02.557
to be so good at pretending
to listen to my stupid shit.

36:02.590 --> 36:07.057
Well, I like to actually
pretend that I'm your friend.

36:07.924 --> 36:09.524
Fuck you.

36:09.556 --> 36:10.823
Because you never
told me about him.

36:10.856 --> 36:11.556
Why would I tell you anything?

36:11.589 --> 36:12.856
Nice to meet you.
I'm Felix.

36:12.889 --> 36:13.689
Hi.

36:13.723 --> 36:14.957
Nice to meet you.

36:14.989 --> 36:16.556
So what do you
do at this party?

36:16.588 --> 36:17.522
I don't know.

36:17.556 --> 36:19.123
Nice robe, though.

36:19.156 --> 36:20.656
Yeah, I know.

36:20.689 --> 36:23.056
I decided to wear
something a little

36:23.088 --> 36:25.589
less stressful to take off.

36:25.622 --> 36:27.522
I think that's
a very good plan.

36:27.554 --> 36:28.920
So what are you doing tonight?

36:28.953 --> 36:29.487
I don't know.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.454
Why don't you tell me?

36:30.488 --> 36:33.421
Do you want to head
back to the room and...

36:33.453 --> 36:34.621
I thought you would never ask.

36:38.086 --> 36:41.619
Conway, were you not
going to say hi to me?

36:41.653 --> 36:42.720
Hi.

36:42.753 --> 36:48.552
Why are you over here,
talking to no one, being weird?

36:48.585 --> 36:49.986
I don't really
mind just chilling,

36:50.019 --> 36:52.385
grooving to the songs.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.751
I was about to go smoke.

36:55.785 --> 36:59.384
Let's go to Ria's room
and have a quickie.

36:59.417 --> 37:02.716
I don't think Nisa would
like that very much.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.583
Are you serious?

37:04.616 --> 37:06.549
You thought I was serious?

37:06.583 --> 37:08.016
Nisa's my friend.

37:08.048 --> 37:08.717
Right, right.

37:08.749 --> 37:10.783
Well, I could use another drink.

37:10.815 --> 37:12.082
Come on.

37:12.115 --> 37:14.750
Let's do a line in the
room, is what I meant.

37:44.578 --> 37:47.611
Everyone thinks I'm
a boyfriend stealer.

37:47.644 --> 37:48.744
Why?

37:48.779 --> 37:52.045
You get that rap from
actually stealing boyfriends?

37:52.077 --> 37:54.511
Or just attempting to?

37:54.543 --> 37:55.811
I'd say my batting
average is 50%.

38:08.476 --> 38:09.076
Here.

38:09.109 --> 38:09.843
You try.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.675
You know... OK, I
don't know about this.

38:15.709 --> 38:18.041
I don't really do this.

38:18.075 --> 38:21.742
Well, what would be
a good idea, then?

38:21.774 --> 38:22.907
I got it.

38:22.939 --> 38:24.607
Take a line off of me.

38:32.472 --> 38:33.073
You're crazy.

38:33.105 --> 38:35.706
I can't.

38:35.738 --> 38:36.705
Come on, Conway.

38:36.739 --> 38:38.806
Stop being a prude and
take the line off me.

38:38.839 --> 38:40.539
You're making things awkward.

38:49.138 --> 38:51.771
What the fuck, Conway?

38:51.804 --> 38:53.437
Baby!

38:53.470 --> 38:55.637
I was just trying coke
for the first time.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.936
Remember you told me I should
open up and try new things.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.436
Yeah, academically.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.902
Not with fucking whores!

39:00.935 --> 39:02.736
Hey, stop name-calling, bitch.

39:02.770 --> 39:05.836
There's nothing sexual
about doing a line of coke

39:05.869 --> 39:07.002
on somebody else's body.

39:07.035 --> 39:07.969
Exactly.

39:08.001 --> 39:10.801
I could believe
this dumb slut could do

39:10.835 --> 39:12.668
something like this, but you?

39:12.701 --> 39:13.900
Really?

39:13.934 --> 39:16.700
I spent three hours getting
ready for this stupid lingerie

39:16.734 --> 39:17.534
party.

39:17.566 --> 39:18.967
That's understandable.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.699
And you look really hot,
so I think I'm liking that.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.700
This is not a lingerie party.

39:25.733 --> 39:26.867
It's a sex party.

39:26.899 --> 39:29.699
Or at least that's what we
were about to turn it into.

39:29.733 --> 39:31.366
Hadley, fuck you.

39:31.399 --> 39:32.665
Get up, get up.

39:46.531 --> 39:47.131
Stop!

39:47.164 --> 39:47.831
Stop!

39:47.864 --> 39:49.831
You guys are ruining my party!

39:49.864 --> 39:51.831
My god, this is
classy, not trashy.

39:51.863 --> 39:53.831
What are you guys doing?

39:53.863 --> 39:57.862
Are you kidding me?

39:57.896 --> 40:00.730
That was, like,
$650 worth of blow.

40:00.763 --> 40:03.829
Nisa, you need to get out.

40:03.862 --> 40:04.761
What?

40:04.796 --> 40:07.695
It's that bitch that
started everything.

40:07.728 --> 40:08.828
Nisa, I love you.

40:08.861 --> 40:11.827
But you need to get out now.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.960
Bye bye, baby.

40:13.994 --> 40:17.794
You owe us money
for that, by the way.

40:17.827 --> 40:19.994
Snort it off my ass, bitch.

40:29.991 --> 40:31.692
Straighten your pelvis.

40:31.724 --> 40:33.758
Straighten your core.

40:33.791 --> 40:35.857
Gab, if I have to
tell you again,

40:35.891 --> 40:39.558
you'll be out of this sequence.

40:39.590 --> 40:40.524
Where's Ainsley?

40:40.557 --> 40:41.691
She's up next.

40:41.724 --> 40:43.989
Maren and Saren, where are they?

40:44.022 --> 40:47.723
They're all in the bathroom,
bringing back lunch.

40:47.757 --> 40:48.857
They're throwing up again?

40:48.890 --> 40:50.623
Yeah.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.090
We do it in groups now.

40:52.123 --> 40:54.823
No one wants to be the
only bulimic in the room.

40:54.856 --> 40:56.856
Girls, this is serious.

40:56.888 --> 41:01.389
I'm trying to teach you the
divine heroics of the ballet.

41:01.421 --> 41:03.821
I don't want to host
another dreadful

41:03.855 --> 41:05.421
dancer-parent orientation.

41:05.454 --> 41:08.388
Well, you don't
exactly help, constantly

41:08.421 --> 41:10.986
always telling us how
un-proportionate we all are.

41:11.019 --> 41:12.686
Because bones are beautiful.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.854
Curves are not.

41:18.686 --> 41:19.287
Hey.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.586
Sweetie.

41:20.618 --> 41:21.253
That's all I've got.

41:24.819 --> 41:26.386
So you're not sharing now?

41:26.419 --> 41:29.451
I'm going to sit here and
watch you enjoy yourself?

41:29.485 --> 41:32.852
What happened to the
share I gave you last week?

41:32.884 --> 41:34.585
I don't know, Don.

41:34.618 --> 41:37.084
I gave it to charity.

41:37.117 --> 41:39.616
I'm not having this
conversation right now.

41:39.650 --> 41:44.616
Just shoot it if
you're gonna shoot it.

41:44.648 --> 41:47.116
So you want me to shoot it so
I'll shut the fuck up, right?

41:47.149 --> 41:49.016
That's it?

41:49.048 --> 41:50.450
That's not what I said, Nisa.

41:50.482 --> 41:52.350
Just let me do my thing.

41:55.815 --> 41:59.481
Do you have any clean needles?

41:59.514 --> 42:00.980
I don't supply that shit.

42:01.014 --> 42:03.848
I'm not a gay and
lesbian center.

42:07.514 --> 42:11.413
So then in my note, I said,
why are you writing notes to me?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.914
We're seniors.

42:12.946 --> 42:15.646
I mean, he could have at least,
like, slipped it in my locker

42:15.679 --> 42:17.079
so that nobody knows
he still likes me.

42:17.112 --> 42:18.945
My gosh, you're
so brilliant.

42:18.979 --> 42:21.046
You should write a book
or something, you know?

42:21.078 --> 42:23.778
Or better yet, a blog
about social etiquette

42:23.810 --> 42:26.111
and high school hierarchy.

42:26.145 --> 42:29.744
Today, tomorrow, and for
the rest of the social era.

42:29.777 --> 42:31.610
You know, or
something like that.

42:34.143 --> 42:35.977
Someone's at your door.

42:36.009 --> 42:37.743
Yeah, I should
actually get that.

42:37.777 --> 42:40.444
You expecting somebody?

42:40.477 --> 42:42.976
Well, just whoever
it is, just send them...

42:43.008 --> 42:43.875
Yeah.

42:43.908 --> 42:45.709
You know, I'll tell
them to come back

42:45.743 --> 42:47.608
when you're not so fucked up.

42:47.641 --> 42:48.542
God.

42:51.640 --> 42:52.541
My god.

42:52.575 --> 42:56.375
What are you doing here?

42:56.408 --> 42:57.108
We came for the dope.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.008
Why else would we be here?

42:59.041 --> 43:03.340
And by the way, why do you
want to hurt ballerinas?

43:03.373 --> 43:04.873
It might have
something to do

43:04.905 --> 43:08.472
with the mental, physical,
emotional abuse I've endured

43:08.505 --> 43:10.972
for years in the company.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.606
But let alone at your hands.

43:12.638 --> 43:14.771
You used to be my friend.

43:14.804 --> 43:15.971
I used to own you, bitch.

43:16.004 --> 43:16.806
Yeah?

43:16.838 --> 43:18.905
Well, not anymore.

43:18.939 --> 43:21.472
You know, you can reapply.

43:21.505 --> 43:22.838
Or better yet, go to Russia.

43:22.871 --> 43:23.904
I hear that ballet's good there.

43:23.937 --> 43:24.604
Yeah.

43:24.637 --> 43:26.670
Just leave the country already.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.103
You know what, I need to know
one thing from you bitches.

43:29.136 --> 43:30.103
Where's Ria?

43:30.137 --> 43:30.969
Because she owes me.

43:31.003 --> 43:32.704
She's in juvy.

43:32.737 --> 43:37.369
Well, actually, she broke out.

43:37.402 --> 43:38.802
Have you checked
her dad's house?

43:38.835 --> 43:40.002
I mean, if I was
tired and hungry,

43:40.035 --> 43:41.968
that's where I would go.

43:42.002 --> 43:45.402
Well, if you tell anybody
you just saw me here,

43:45.435 --> 43:48.967
it's going to be the last thing
to leave your stupid mouth.

43:49.001 --> 43:49.969
Don't come here again.

43:55.534 --> 43:56.634
Get the fuck up.

43:56.666 --> 43:57.466
What?

43:57.499 --> 43:58.399
Get the fuck up.

43:58.432 --> 43:59.334
What the fuck?

43:59.366 --> 44:01.965
Am I missing something here?

44:01.999 --> 44:04.434
These fucking cunts just
showed up at your door.

44:04.466 --> 44:05.899
What the fuck do I know
about some fucking cunts?

44:05.932 --> 44:07.566
For your dope.
For your dope.

44:07.598 --> 44:08.766
You're holding out on me now.

44:08.798 --> 44:11.533
I'm not... what the... I'm not
fucking holding out on you.

44:11.565 --> 44:13.332
Yeah, you're a
lying piece of shit.

44:13.366 --> 44:15.598
Look, they put fucking
money in my pocket.

44:15.631 --> 44:16.865
You put my dick in your mouth.

44:16.898 --> 44:19.065
A man's got to have
some priorities.

44:19.098 --> 44:20.031
Fuck.

44:22.697 --> 44:24.397
Fuck you.

44:24.429 --> 44:25.064
Fuck you.

44:32.062 --> 44:35.028
And five, six, seven, eight.

44:35.062 --> 44:38.028
And balancing, balancing.

44:38.062 --> 44:38.996
Turn, two, three, four.

44:39.029 --> 44:41.495
Now fly, Demitri, fly!

44:41.528 --> 44:42.662
Yes, fly with me.

44:42.695 --> 44:43.529
That's it.

44:43.562 --> 44:45.529
Fly, yes!

44:45.561 --> 44:47.027
Soar over the atmosphere.

46:19.083 --> 46:23.849
You know, being nude during
a massage is what separates

46:23.882 --> 46:29.316
the men from the boys.

46:29.349 --> 46:33.316
I know that your old
ballet school would have

46:33.348 --> 46:37.048
a personal therapist over here.

46:37.081 --> 46:39.913
We just have to
hybridize our positions.

46:43.347 --> 46:45.447
You are tense.

46:45.479 --> 46:46.813
You need to relax.

46:46.846 --> 46:49.347
I know what you're
doing, Mr. Lustgarten.

46:49.379 --> 46:51.013
You're trying to seduce me.

46:51.046 --> 46:53.445
I'm not a full-on queer.

46:53.479 --> 46:54.945
I'm sorry.

46:54.977 --> 46:58.879
Although I have
experimented before.

46:58.912 --> 47:02.377
So you have?

47:02.411 --> 47:04.345
Well, listen to this.

47:04.377 --> 47:08.310
You are not to breathe a
word of this to Delphine.

47:08.343 --> 47:16.043
For if you do, I promise you, I
will snip off your tiny balls.

47:16.910 --> 47:17.977
Do you hear me?

47:31.708 --> 47:34.674
Here you are.

47:34.707 --> 47:37.040
Now, you better tell me
something more than nonsense

47:37.073 --> 47:37.840
this time.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.572
Will I ever get
as much attention

47:41.606 --> 47:43.274
as my sister does in school?

47:46.373 --> 47:47.706
All right.

47:47.739 --> 47:49.372
I guess I cheated.

47:49.405 --> 47:51.805
I made this thingy go to yes.

47:54.671 --> 47:57.471
It's called a planchet.

47:57.503 --> 48:00.004
And you need to stop
thinking I'm better than you.

48:00.036 --> 48:03.338
I'd rather have your pear bottom
and pearly whites any day.

48:03.370 --> 48:05.703
I was just messing with you.

48:05.737 --> 48:07.637
I knew you were watching.

48:07.670 --> 48:08.936
You have to set
this on your lap.

48:11.802 --> 48:14.736
We shouldn't have a problem
contacting the spirit world.

48:14.769 --> 48:17.369
Our hearts are pure,
I'd like to think.

48:17.401 --> 48:19.734
You just have to ask
serious questions.

48:19.768 --> 48:21.069
Like what?

48:21.102 --> 48:22.036
How you'll die?

48:25.966 --> 48:30.566
U-Z-I.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.334
U-Z-I?

48:32.366 --> 48:35.766
It must stand for something.

48:35.799 --> 48:39.366
Urinary zinc infection?

48:39.398 --> 48:41.998
No such thing.

48:42.031 --> 48:46.499
Whoever you are,
reveal yourself.

48:48.099 --> 48:49.033
My god.

48:49.065 --> 48:50.466
My god, Saren.

49:00.364 --> 49:03.298
Hello, Maren and Saren.

49:03.330 --> 49:06.397
I am Harmonia.

49:06.430 --> 49:09.363
I'm the lady from the
music box that you gave

49:09.396 --> 49:14.729
to Ria for her super-sweet 16.

49:14.761 --> 49:19.527
I came from the same garage
sale as that Ouija board.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.294
Do you remember?

49:23.061 --> 49:26.361
I just didn't want to
spell it all out on there.

49:26.393 --> 49:29.594
I mean, I've got things to do.

49:32.560 --> 49:37.726
But Saren, what I was
trying to tell you

49:37.759 --> 49:39.793
is that you will
die from an Uzi.

49:42.758 --> 49:46.725
It's an Israeli submachine gun.

49:46.758 --> 49:50.624
In fact, it's the same
model that Nisa attacked

49:50.657 --> 49:52.557
your ballet school with.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.791
So you mean she'll
strike again?

49:54.823 --> 49:57.324
Of course.

49:57.357 --> 50:02.423
But Maren knows
that, doesn't she?

50:02.456 --> 50:05.556
I was going to have
you die by the sword.

50:05.588 --> 50:08.454
Yes, but you're going
to change your mind

50:08.487 --> 50:11.055
when you sit down to write it.

50:11.088 --> 50:16.754
Maren, you have such a gift.

50:16.787 --> 50:18.454
Really?

50:18.487 --> 50:21.587
I thought it was just
a magical typewriter.

50:21.621 --> 50:24.754
So you're saying that she can
determine destiny by whatever

50:24.786 --> 50:26.819
she types on that thing?

50:26.853 --> 50:28.919
Precisely.

50:28.951 --> 50:33.019
And you'd think she would use
it to do good in the world,

50:33.052 --> 50:37.819
to feed the hungry,
to house the homeless,

50:37.851 --> 50:40.385
or to put pants on
pantless people.

50:43.417 --> 50:48.284
But she is evil.

50:48.318 --> 50:52.483
She is more evil than Nisa.

50:52.517 --> 50:59.017
In fact, she is the most
horrible, despicable girl

50:59.050 --> 51:01.483
who ever walked the
face of this Earth.

51:04.582 --> 51:06.682
Shame on you, Maren.

51:06.715 --> 51:07.515
Shame.

51:07.547 --> 51:08.514
No!

51:08.548 --> 51:10.782
Shame on you!

51:10.814 --> 51:11.780
Shame!

51:11.814 --> 51:12.714
No!

51:12.746 --> 51:14.347
Shame on you.

51:18.980 --> 51:20.414
No!

51:20.446 --> 51:22.347
When will the rain stop?

51:22.379 --> 51:27.379
When will the sun shine again
so we can play foosball?

51:27.413 --> 51:28.480
I don't know, Dad.

51:28.512 --> 51:30.544
But foosball was
an indoor sport.

51:30.578 --> 51:32.378
And we can always
play it after dinner.

51:32.411 --> 51:33.979
It's set up in the garage.

51:34.011 --> 51:36.544
No, I want to
play badminton now.

51:36.577 --> 51:38.511
We can't play badminton now.

51:38.543 --> 51:41.910
The rain's finally stopped,
but it's a bit muddy out there,

51:41.944 --> 51:42.845
and we just can't play.

51:46.410 --> 51:47.577
Ria.

51:47.609 --> 51:48.976
Hi.

51:49.009 --> 51:50.442
No, no, no.

51:50.476 --> 51:51.509
Stop, stop.

51:51.542 --> 51:52.376
It's me.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.708
It's your little girl.

51:55.742 --> 51:59.509
You're not the little sweet
precious Ria that we raised.

51:59.542 --> 52:01.042
Your mother would
be so disappointed.

52:01.074 --> 52:02.808
She would be sick
to her stomach.

52:02.841 --> 52:06.842
An officer just left not
more than 20 minutes ago.

52:06.875 --> 52:08.675
You're a wanted criminal.

52:08.708 --> 52:10.342
You're no daughter of mine.

52:13.573 --> 52:16.973
Won't my own father
believe the honest truth?

52:17.006 --> 52:19.507
I had nothing to do with this.

52:19.539 --> 52:21.306
Can you please help me, Daddy?

52:21.338 --> 52:23.539
Can't I just have a full night's
sleep in the crawl space?

52:23.571 --> 52:25.405
I'll be on the run
again in the morning.

52:31.972 --> 52:33.538
No, I don't want it.

52:33.571 --> 52:36.405
What'd you do, microwave it?

52:36.438 --> 52:38.503
All right, then.

52:38.536 --> 52:39.736
You can stay the night.

52:39.771 --> 52:41.903
But in the morning, you have
to decide whether you're going

52:41.936 --> 52:44.371
to turn yourself in or leave.

52:44.403 --> 52:45.170
OK.

52:45.203 --> 52:47.903
And I'll say I
haven't seen you.

52:47.935 --> 52:51.569
Now, go play some
foosball with Papa.

52:51.602 --> 52:52.768
Put him to bed.

52:52.801 --> 52:54.868
And don't you dare go upstairs
unless you have something

52:54.902 --> 52:56.435
really urgent to discuss.

52:56.467 --> 52:57.568
OK.
Thank you, Daddy.

52:57.602 --> 52:58.535
Thank you.

52:58.568 --> 52:59.436
You're welcome, pumpkin.

53:04.733 --> 53:05.602
Hey, Papa.

53:09.067 --> 53:10.600
Who are you?

53:10.632 --> 53:12.399
Your grand-daughter, Ria.

53:12.433 --> 53:16.032
Do you not recognize me?

53:16.065 --> 53:16.932
Shut your hole.

53:16.966 --> 53:19.865
My grand-daughter
is a ballet dancer.

53:19.898 --> 53:22.465
She's a fine one, too.

53:22.498 --> 53:24.598
I am a ballet dancer.

53:24.632 --> 53:27.266
Do you not remember
coming to my recitals?

53:27.299 --> 53:28.531
If you're a ballet
dancer, where's

53:28.563 --> 53:32.030
your leotard and your tutu?

53:32.063 --> 53:35.563
Silly Papa, that's all just
a matter of changing into.

53:35.597 --> 53:37.430
Why don't you wait
here, I'll change

53:37.463 --> 53:39.564
and put on a show for you
of aggrandized proportions.

53:45.495 --> 53:47.662
Me and the boys will
all be waiting for you.

53:54.295 --> 53:56.794
Ria opens
her music box and admires

53:56.827 --> 54:00.594
the tiny ballerina that
swivels in perfect harmony

54:00.627 --> 54:03.794
with the little classical
music that flows from the jewel

54:03.827 --> 54:06.593
encrusted ornamental gift.

54:50.388 --> 54:52.622
Suddenly, Nisa is
reflected in its mirror.

54:55.953 --> 54:57.620
Nisa, how'd you get in here?

54:57.654 --> 54:59.987
It's OK.

55:00.021 --> 55:04.454
We just need to
have a girl-to-girl.

55:04.487 --> 55:07.553
We're still besties, aren't we?

55:07.585 --> 55:10.352
Or did my episode change that?

55:10.386 --> 55:13.485
You fucking got me
locked up, you bitch!

55:13.518 --> 55:15.385
They're fucking after me now.

55:15.418 --> 55:16.752
How can you just show
up here like this?

55:19.517 --> 55:20.185
I'm sorry.

55:20.217 --> 55:21.817
I just... I just freaked out, OK?

55:21.851 --> 55:23.584
I don't understand
why they're trying

55:23.617 --> 55:25.417
to involve you in all of this.

55:25.449 --> 55:26.717
That's real fucking sweet.

55:26.750 --> 55:29.416
Why don't you tell them that?

55:29.450 --> 55:31.617
You ruined everything for me.

55:31.650 --> 55:33.550
I'm going to get held
back because of you,

55:33.583 --> 55:36.782
not to mention lose my
scholarship with the company

55:36.814 --> 55:39.681
and probably get dragged back
to solitary confinement at St.

55:39.715 --> 55:40.482
Helen's.

55:46.814 --> 55:50.981
I'm here because
I care about you.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.415
And I want to make things right.

55:56.312 --> 56:04.214
So why can't we just take
these mollies like old times?

56:07.579 --> 56:08.413
You know I love molly.

56:10.945 --> 56:13.645
I guess life sucks and
there's no point in dealing

56:13.677 --> 56:14.745
with it sober at this point.

56:29.743 --> 56:33.774
So... so you broke out?

56:33.808 --> 56:34.942
Yeah.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.841
They didn't just let me go.

56:36.874 --> 56:41.007
Maybe they would have if
you turned yourself in.

56:41.041 --> 56:45.008
Well, you know, I think that
you should hit the streets

56:45.041 --> 56:50.441
with me and get rid of shit.

56:50.473 --> 56:53.672
You dealing again?

56:53.705 --> 56:55.739
I need to get the
fuck out of here.

56:55.773 --> 56:56.840
It's going to take some money.

56:56.872 --> 56:57.939
Where are you trying to go?

57:02.038 --> 57:04.571
Anywhere non-USA.

57:04.604 --> 57:08.238
Mexico or Brazil, I don't know.

57:08.272 --> 57:10.239
They'd never let either
of us across the border.

57:13.503 --> 57:17.937
Well, Don Elsoroy's cousin
is going to charter a plane,

57:17.969 --> 57:20.970
and you're coming.

57:21.002 --> 57:23.935
Get real.

57:23.968 --> 57:27.237
Do you not trust me?

57:27.268 --> 57:30.802
Ria, it's time we start
a new life for ourselves.

57:30.835 --> 57:33.634
South America isn't going to
give a shit if we disrespected

57:33.667 --> 57:35.602
some prissy ballet school.

57:38.767 --> 57:46.667
I don't speak Portuguese
or... Spanish or...

57:48.699 --> 57:51.300
This molly is strong.

57:51.332 --> 57:52.399
Are you feeling it?

57:52.432 --> 57:53.233
Yeah.

57:53.266 --> 57:53.733
Already.

57:53.766 --> 57:54.667
It's good.

58:00.798 --> 58:04.498
Ria, I... I need your help.

58:04.530 --> 58:06.464
Because I have the perfect plan.

58:09.663 --> 58:17.596
Ria, will you just look at
me for a second, please?

58:18.695 --> 58:22.928
Listen, don't you
want to dance again?

58:22.962 --> 58:24.795
Nothing ever stopped me.

59:30.686 --> 59:31.888
What the hell is going on?

59:36.685 --> 59:38.686
I never cared for
that kid anyway.

59:49.852 --> 59:51.485
Nisa!

59:51.517 --> 59:52.351
Nisa, you missed it!

59:58.751 --> 01:00:00.851
You're my grand-daughter,
but nobody's perfect.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.744
I don't know if people are
going to go for this stuff.

01:01:06.442 --> 01:01:08.575
Well, I don't know what
to write about anymore.

01:01:08.609 --> 01:01:10.909
I take from real life and
people who dump on me.

01:01:10.942 --> 01:01:13.776
I try to be creative,
but it's just as bad.

01:01:20.873 --> 01:01:22.473
I didn't say trash it.

01:01:22.507 --> 01:01:24.241
I'm just trying to
say it's probably

01:01:24.273 --> 01:01:25.806
not good for young audiences.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.807
I can't believe you just
ripped up that chapter.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.805
It means I've put up with
all that pecking for nothing.

01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:31.706
Don't worry about it.

01:01:31.739 --> 01:01:33.972
I scanned it already
to have a backup.

01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:35.939
I just wanted to
see your reaction.

01:01:36.806 --> 01:01:38.872
You're psycho.

01:01:38.905 --> 01:01:41.272
Yeah, I am.

01:01:41.305 --> 01:01:45.572
So any more criticism about my
book before I start chapter 10?

01:01:45.604 --> 01:01:49.270
Just that maybe you should
bulk up the male characters.

01:01:49.303 --> 01:01:51.238
What's going on with Conway?

01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:52.870
It's too late for that.

01:01:52.904 --> 01:01:55.471
He has nothing to do with how
the story unfolds anyways.

01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:22.900
Ria rises in a gown

01:02:22.932 --> 01:02:27.766
alone in a strange
blue atmosphere.

01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:32.958
Remember, girls, adagio
in no way means allegro.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:36.391
And by the way, since we have no
one to play the dancing noble,

01:03:36.424 --> 01:03:41.423
which one you girls is going
to volunteer to play the duke?

01:03:41.456 --> 01:03:44.822
All right, I'll just have to
pick the most masculine one.

01:03:44.856 --> 01:03:47.857
All right, you little
daughters of bitches.

01:03:47.889 --> 01:03:49.355
This is how it's going to work.

01:03:49.389 --> 01:03:51.356
Everyone's going to back
up against the wall.

01:03:51.389 --> 01:03:53.656
Yeah, lick the wall,
you little bitches.

01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:54.555
Turn around.

01:04:01.853 --> 01:04:06.587
Ria, so which one of
these little bitches

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.520
do you think we
should end first?

01:04:13.786 --> 01:04:14.853
I...

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:20.586
Ria, don't you think
you're appearing weak?

01:04:20.619 --> 01:04:25.251
We had such a lovely entrance,
so don't fade out on me now.

01:04:25.284 --> 01:04:25.852
OK.

01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:30.518
Ainsley.

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:33.217
Ainsley, get the fuck over here.

01:04:33.251 --> 01:04:34.218
Good.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.917
Go for it.

01:04:35.951 --> 01:04:36.918
Shoot!

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:38.416
Damn it!

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:39.883
You missed them.

01:04:39.915 --> 01:04:40.882
Go!

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:43.350
You're both dead.

01:04:43.382 --> 01:04:46.182
Why does no one obey the
ballerina with the gun?

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.349
Ria, you're not well.

01:04:47.382 --> 01:04:49.282
You don't want to do this.

01:04:49.315 --> 01:04:50.815
So?

01:04:50.847 --> 01:04:53.281
Just put the gun down,
and I won't be mad at you.

01:04:53.315 --> 01:04:54.215
I won't be mad.

01:04:54.247 --> 01:04:56.947
It's not... it's not me.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.780
Get up.

01:04:57.814 --> 01:04:58.713
Face the wall.

01:04:58.746 --> 01:05:00.148
I don't want to look at you.

01:05:12.745 --> 01:05:14.945
Please, I'll do
whatever you want.

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:16.879
It's too late for that.

01:05:20.978 --> 01:05:23.611
What have we done
to deserve this?

01:05:23.644 --> 01:05:24.443
Deserve what?

01:05:24.476 --> 01:05:26.911
I haven't done
anything to you yet.

01:05:26.945 --> 01:05:29.910
Hold us against our will.

01:05:29.943 --> 01:05:31.410
It's 1:30.

01:05:31.444 --> 01:05:32.577
Class ain't even over yet.

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:35.277
You're making us witness evil.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.177
You better hope you live
long enough to be a witness.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:41.177
You're a terrorist.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.943
A terrorist?

01:05:42.976 --> 01:05:45.442
I'm pretty cute for a
terrorist, aren't I?

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:46.276
Aren't I?

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:47.309
Yes.

01:05:47.342 --> 01:05:48.541
Yes.

01:05:48.574 --> 01:05:52.440
We could have been friends,
but you laughed at Gab's jokes.

01:05:52.474 --> 01:05:53.274
I'm sorry.

01:05:53.306 --> 01:05:54.773
They weren't...
They weren't funny.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.174
Did you know that when Eve
ate the forbidden fruit,

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.473
humanity was doomed.

01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:06.506
And therefore, you're
meant to suffer.

01:06:06.538 --> 01:06:09.205
Now, where's Gab?

01:06:09.239 --> 01:06:10.339
She run out the back door?

01:06:10.372 --> 01:06:11.173
No.

01:06:11.205 --> 01:06:12.405
She couldn't have.

01:06:12.439 --> 01:06:16.305
It's locked always.

01:06:16.338 --> 01:06:17.605
Clever girl.

01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:21.304
Then where does she hide?

01:06:21.337 --> 01:06:22.603
She has to be in the prop room.

01:06:22.637 --> 01:06:26.304
That's the only other
place that she could be.

01:06:26.336 --> 01:06:27.638
Please don't hurt me.

01:06:31.635 --> 01:06:36.369
Do you know what happens when
you don't play by my rules?

01:06:36.403 --> 01:06:38.336
Certain death.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:40.636
That's all that happens.

01:06:40.668 --> 01:06:42.168
What do you want from me?

01:06:42.202 --> 01:06:45.601
My dad will give you
whatever it is that you want.

01:06:45.633 --> 01:06:46.534
I'm sorry, Nisa.

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:49.600
I was a bitch.

01:06:49.633 --> 01:06:51.200
You still are one.

01:06:51.234 --> 01:06:52.133
No.

01:06:52.168 --> 01:06:57.332
Your face has bitch
written all over it.

01:06:57.365 --> 01:06:58.233
Dump it out.

01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:04.300
Anything good?

01:07:04.331 --> 01:07:06.699
I have $500 in gift cards.

01:07:17.665 --> 01:07:18.365
Hey!

01:07:22.396 --> 01:07:23.330
Any last words?

01:07:30.762 --> 01:07:34.295
Fainting spoils all the fun.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.393
Open up, you little slut.

01:07:45.427 --> 01:07:46.862
I want to play with you.

01:07:51.393 --> 01:07:53.261
You know you're in there.

01:07:53.294 --> 01:07:57.392
This door is never
locked or even shut.

01:07:57.426 --> 01:08:00.360
Gab's
panic worsens as the pounding

01:08:00.393 --> 01:08:03.892
continues and grows more
violent, coupled with Nisa's

01:08:03.925 --> 01:08:07.724
increasing demonic rage.

01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:11.390
Gaby.

01:08:11.423 --> 01:08:15.625
Hide and seek is for
little kids, not big girls.

01:08:21.288 --> 01:08:26.288
It seems we have a little
birdie loose in the attic.

01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:29.555
The only one with half a
brain, making me work to kill.

01:08:49.352 --> 01:08:53.752
Ria... Ria, bring
Delphine in here.

01:08:53.785 --> 01:08:54.586
All right.

01:08:54.618 --> 01:08:55.585
Come on, let's go.

01:08:55.618 --> 01:08:56.386
Go!

01:09:04.317 --> 01:09:05.617
Where's that weasel?

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:07.251
What?

01:09:07.285 --> 01:09:08.783
She's up in the ceiling.

01:09:08.816 --> 01:09:10.317
How should I know where she is?

01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:11.883
I've never been up
there or had any reason

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:14.251
to study the blueprints
of this building.

01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:19.282
We have business to attend to.

01:09:19.316 --> 01:09:20.283
You're right.

01:09:20.316 --> 01:09:22.450
We do.

01:09:22.483 --> 01:09:25.413
Ria!

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:27.716
I don't really want
to kill the sisters.

01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:29.413
Can you do it.

01:09:29.448 --> 01:09:33.346
You need to kill to
avenge your mother's death.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:37.448
They had nothing
to do with that.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:41.313
Maren, tell me,
beautiful, how does it end?

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:42.345
I don't know.

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.747
I haven't gotten that far.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.645
I know, but you're the writer.

01:09:46.679 --> 01:09:48.513
What were you thinking?

01:09:48.546 --> 01:09:51.345
There's a few twists
I'm thinking of.

01:09:51.379 --> 01:09:53.513
Does it involve the
sisters surviving?

01:09:57.244 --> 01:09:58.310
There's a massacre.

01:09:58.344 --> 01:10:01.178
No one gets out alive.

01:10:01.211 --> 01:10:02.777
Why would you Not
let yourself live?

01:10:02.809 --> 01:10:04.344
Why would you seal
your own fate?

01:10:04.378 --> 01:10:06.644
I'd look selfish if
you died and I didn't

01:10:06.676 --> 01:10:08.610
go down with the sinking ship.

01:10:08.643 --> 01:10:10.309
Better selfish than dead.

01:10:10.343 --> 01:10:12.444
Why would the reader
want me to live?

01:10:12.477 --> 01:10:14.277
I like your character.

01:10:14.308 --> 01:10:16.342
It's better than mine.

01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:23.342
If I die... when I die...
It's just another ballerina.

01:10:23.374 --> 01:10:26.241
But when you die, people
might shed a tear.

01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:28.307
Well, I haven't gotten
that far in the story yet.

01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:31.708
I suppose we could rewrite
what hasn't been written.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.673
What do you say we make
a beeline to the door?

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:34.508
No.

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:36.174
Saren, I'm afraid.

01:10:36.207 --> 01:10:40.373
I'm afraid too,
but we have to try.

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:42.473
The getaway driver
is waiting outside.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:44.372
He'll kill anyone who flees.

01:10:44.405 --> 01:10:47.638
There's a chance he misses.

01:10:50.471 --> 01:10:52.305
You're the writer.

01:10:52.338 --> 01:10:55.438
Why can't you get
us out of this?

01:10:55.471 --> 01:10:59.638
Whether people paid or didn't
pay, they expect a horror.

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:01.304
As much as you and
I want to live,

01:11:01.337 --> 01:11:02.604
the kill count
doesn't go uncounted,

01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:06.504
and Ainsley is next on the list.

01:11:06.536 --> 01:11:09.336
I want you to go back
in there and penetrate

01:11:09.369 --> 01:11:14.568
every orifice of their bodies
with your Uzi lead now.

01:11:14.602 --> 01:11:16.669
They're not worth my bullets.

01:11:16.702 --> 01:11:20.334
They're, like, $0.50 a load.

01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:24.368
Then just make them choke
each other at gunpoint.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.366
Then in some sick way,
they all take part in this.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.667
Yeah.

01:11:29.699 --> 01:11:32.667
Like Santa's little helpers.

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:51.663
Drink?

01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:52.663
No.

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.497
Come on.

01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:54.563
We're alone now.

01:11:54.597 --> 01:11:56.396
Put the sword down.

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:59.498
You know, Ria could
come back in any minute,

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:01.530
and wouldn't that be funny?

01:12:01.563 --> 01:12:04.696
If we're all cutesy
all of a sudden.

01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:05.530
What?

01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:07.362
Having a tea party.

01:12:07.396 --> 01:12:08.896
She doesn't know
about our plan?

01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:11.361
I didn't see much
sense in telling her.

01:12:11.395 --> 01:12:13.561
She could have shot me.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.429
You know, honestly, I
figured she would have

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:16.728
chickened out by now anyway.

01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:17.594
No.

01:12:17.627 --> 01:12:21.560
She's even more
psychotic than you are.

01:12:21.594 --> 01:12:22.861
The drugs are helping her.

01:12:22.893 --> 01:12:26.360
What did you give her?

01:12:26.393 --> 01:12:28.160
A mix of things.

01:12:28.193 --> 01:12:31.758
Methamphetamines, PCP.

01:12:31.792 --> 01:12:35.558
My, with any luck, she'll
turn the gun on herself.

01:12:35.592 --> 01:12:37.860
Then we'll have
nothing to worry about.

01:12:37.892 --> 01:12:40.258
They're her father's weapons.

01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:42.225
I guess it's better she
doesn't know anything.

01:12:42.259 --> 01:12:44.391
That way, if she's caught,
there'll be nothing

01:12:44.423 --> 01:12:46.558
about me in her testimony.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.525
Here.

01:12:47.557 --> 01:12:51.290
Here's 5,500, a token
of my appreciation.

01:12:56.723 --> 01:12:58.423
No.

01:12:58.455 --> 01:12:59.789
I need the cash.

01:12:59.823 --> 01:13:02.490
I deposited the contents
of the safe yesterday.

01:13:02.522 --> 01:13:04.255
Check's no good to me.

01:13:04.288 --> 01:13:05.223
It's OK.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:08.322
You can deposit that
anywhere for a $5 fee.

01:13:08.355 --> 01:13:10.556
So you're just going
to flee with the rest?

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.721
20 grand, that won't
last long in Mexico

01:13:15.753 --> 01:13:17.520
with my shopping habit.

01:13:17.554 --> 01:13:19.454
20 grand?

01:13:19.486 --> 01:13:22.420
You and I agreed to
split the till 50/50.

01:13:22.454 --> 01:13:23.321
That was your idea.

01:13:23.353 --> 01:13:24.552
I never agreed.

01:13:24.586 --> 01:13:25.586
I'm a woman.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.752
Women require bigger
salaries than little girls

01:13:28.784 --> 01:13:31.120
who are wanted by the FBI.

01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:32.719
You should be thanking me.

01:13:32.752 --> 01:13:33.619
OK.

01:13:33.652 --> 01:13:36.552
Well, this kid is greedy.

01:13:36.584 --> 01:13:38.584
I want double.

01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:42.718
It's bad enough I gotta split
this shit with Ria and tip

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.450
out Don Elsoroy 650.

01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:46.351
Put your sword down.

01:13:46.384 --> 01:13:48.350
I'll cover Don
Elsoroy's fee in cash,

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.483
but you still haven't
killed everyone.

01:13:55.782 --> 01:13:59.149
It's not that
easy on the psyche.

01:14:06.181 --> 01:14:09.547
Now, Saren, for your
last performance.

01:14:09.581 --> 01:14:11.281
Please.

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:12.148
Yes.

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.647
You should be thrilled.

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:18.480
None of the other girls got
a proper last performance.

01:14:18.513 --> 01:14:21.579
But this movement
requires another dancer.

01:14:21.612 --> 01:14:24.145
Imagine she's there.

01:14:24.179 --> 01:14:26.812
Like everything else,
this is all made up.

01:14:34.378 --> 01:14:37.411
But can't my little
sister join me?

01:14:37.443 --> 01:14:38.410
No, Saren.

01:14:38.444 --> 01:14:39.645
This is your last performance.

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:12.507
Maren
and Saren watch Ria

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.840
lose herself in her own mind.

01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:30.638
It is Gab, dead Gab, bound with
strings, dancing haggardly.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.567
She glides through an
atmosphere of nothingness.

01:16:19.565 --> 01:16:21.765
Feels out for someone, anyone.

01:16:45.728 --> 01:16:48.562
She looks up, imagining
rain upon her face.

01:16:57.727 --> 01:17:02.194
I can hear your fear,
you little bitch.

01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:19.616
Wakey wakey.

01:18:19.649 --> 01:18:20.616
What's going...

01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:21.551
On?

01:18:21.584 --> 01:18:22.718
Yeah.

01:18:22.751 --> 01:18:26.850
You have successfully proven
yourself to be the biggest

01:18:26.882 --> 01:18:29.850
pussy in this ballet school.

01:18:29.883 --> 01:18:32.750
Did I faint?

01:18:32.782 --> 01:18:34.049
I guess you fucking fainted.

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.115
Bad dream?

01:18:41.147 --> 01:18:41.780
Yeah.

01:18:41.814 --> 01:18:44.148
Night terrors?

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:49.080
It's a shame you came to,
because this might hurt less.

01:18:58.878 --> 01:19:00.212
Stop it.

01:19:00.246 --> 01:19:00.845
Why?

01:19:00.879 --> 01:19:02.213
Are you jealous?

01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:06.546
Jealous of what?

01:19:06.579 --> 01:19:09.545
Gabriella and me.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.812
You mean Ainsley.

01:19:11.845 --> 01:19:13.445
I hate them both.

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:18.143
Why can't I have a doll?

01:19:18.177 --> 01:19:19.644
You can.

01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:21.142
Just wish it.

01:19:21.176 --> 01:19:22.577
But you're too practical.

01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:28.543
Just let me play with yours.

01:19:28.576 --> 01:19:30.810
Why?

01:19:30.841 --> 01:19:33.375
Just what's the matter?

01:19:33.409 --> 01:19:34.742
Well, why should
I share my toys

01:19:34.774 --> 01:19:38.074
when you don't share your boys?

01:19:38.108 --> 01:19:39.840
Just watch.

01:19:39.874 --> 01:19:41.340
You got her all tangled.

01:19:41.374 --> 01:19:43.741
You're not doing it right.

01:19:43.773 --> 01:19:45.207
I want to orchestrate it, Nisa.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:45.841
No.

01:19:45.874 --> 01:19:48.407
Let me control it.

01:19:48.439 --> 01:19:49.705
You control everything.

01:19:49.739 --> 01:19:52.840
Let me do the ballet.

01:19:52.873 --> 01:19:55.206
Your mommy didn't
teach you how to share?

01:19:58.738 --> 01:20:00.206
You had it all wrong.

01:20:00.238 --> 01:20:02.171
Nisa
holds the controls

01:20:02.204 --> 01:20:06.837
of the marionette puppet,
which is much larger now.

01:21:04.464 --> 01:21:05.197
Get up!

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:11.230
It's time for your last
dance, prima ballerina.

01:21:11.263 --> 01:21:13.230
Do your last dance.

01:21:13.262 --> 01:21:14.395
Dance!

01:21:14.429 --> 01:21:15.131
Dance!

01:21:18.761 --> 01:21:20.162
You're a prima ballerina.

01:21:20.196 --> 01:21:21.829
Stop!

01:21:21.861 --> 01:21:22.595
Dance!

01:21:38.659 --> 01:21:39.759
Stop!

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:43.126
Ainsley
takes a few graceful steps

01:21:43.158 --> 01:21:44.793
and ends in a.

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.290
Poor Ainsley.

01:22:52.616 --> 01:22:56.316
Her tears and sad expression
dissolves into pleasure

01:22:56.349 --> 01:22:58.650
as she moans and
delightfully runs

01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:01.383
her fingers across her lips.

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:04.584
A blood lust victim,
a broken doll.

01:23:11.281 --> 01:23:17.514
As smoke clears, Ria turns
back to Maren and Saren.

01:23:17.547 --> 01:23:18.514
Maren!

01:23:18.547 --> 01:23:19.348
What's happening?

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:25.147
They're onto us next.

01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:26.346
We have to make a run for it.

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.714
No.
No, Saren.

01:23:27.746 --> 01:23:30.380
We can't.

01:23:30.412 --> 01:23:32.779
Maren, I love you.

01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:35.780
You're the best sister
anyone could ever ask for.

01:23:35.812 --> 01:23:38.245
But staying here is suicide.

01:23:38.278 --> 01:23:43.178
Running is just the
same, suicide in motion.

01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:45.077
Don't make me do it alone.

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:46.444
Don't leave me yet.

01:23:46.478 --> 01:23:47.144
It isn't time.

01:23:47.178 --> 01:23:49.511
You're going against everything.

01:23:49.543 --> 01:23:50.411
I'm sorry.

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.110
I'm sorry.

01:23:52.143 --> 01:23:53.144
No!

01:23:53.176 --> 01:23:54.410
Saren!

01:23:56.576 --> 01:23:57.377
No!

01:23:57.409 --> 01:23:58.376
No!

01:23:58.408 --> 01:23:59.143
No!

01:24:22.773 --> 01:24:24.540
Ria
watches with pleasure

01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:26.739
as Saren drags her
bleeding body slowly

01:24:26.773 --> 01:24:29.107
across the carnage-laden floor.

01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:47.405
Saren!

01:24:51.135 --> 01:24:53.069
I'm sorry.

01:24:53.103 --> 01:24:54.069
Saren.

01:24:54.103 --> 01:24:56.337
Saren, no.

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:57.336
Saren, you're fine.

01:24:57.368 --> 01:24:58.803
You're fine.
You're fine.

01:24:58.835 --> 01:25:00.301
You're great.

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:01.768
Saren, Saren.

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:38.598
The daydream
is prolonged, but not too long,

01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:43.130
as soon Ria realizes that
her high-stakes delusion is

01:25:43.164 --> 01:25:46.163
inappropriate and a sick,
deep-rooted fantasy.

01:25:50.795 --> 01:25:54.196
Nisa dances her big
close as the song fades

01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:57.296
and the voices echo around her,
symbolizing the.

01:26:07.093 --> 01:26:10.693
Conway, dance with me.

01:26:10.727 --> 01:26:13.226
I've got you, Nisa.

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.494
Let me take you in my arms.

01:26:16.526 --> 01:26:19.160
Yes, Conway.

01:26:19.192 --> 01:26:22.358
My charming danseur noble.

01:26:22.392 --> 01:26:28.458
Soon, we
will make love again, forever.

01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:30.692
Kiss me, Conway.

01:26:30.724 --> 01:26:33.157
I don't care for dancing.

01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:35.157
Hold me.

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:37.657
Hold me like you held her.

01:26:37.689 --> 01:26:40.457
There is no one else.

01:26:40.489 --> 01:26:43.522
Just you and I,
together at last.

01:26:43.556 --> 01:26:47.356
All that's left to do is love.

01:26:47.388 --> 01:26:50.089
Yes, Conway.

01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:53.287
Make love to me.

01:26:53.321 --> 01:26:54.789
Here?

01:26:54.821 --> 01:26:57.687
Now?

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.154
Here.

01:27:00.187 --> 01:27:01.720
Now.

01:27:01.754 --> 01:27:05.354
I can't wait any longer.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:07.487
No, Nisa.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.720
Save yourself.

01:27:09.752 --> 01:27:10.586
No.

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:14.253
Conway, come back.

01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:16.552
Die with me.

01:27:16.585 --> 01:27:20.086
Let us become dust together.

01:27:22.683 --> 01:27:24.751
Nisa, go get Ria.

01:27:24.784 --> 01:27:27.250
Take her to the bath
and wait for me there.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.752
I'll handle the rest.

01:27:29.784 --> 01:27:32.083
OK.

01:27:32.117 --> 01:27:33.517
You guys are fucked up.

01:27:42.355 --> 01:27:43.810
Saren?

01:27:44.615 --> 01:27:48.382
Ria, drop the gun.

01:27:48.416 --> 01:27:49.581
Come get in the tub with me.

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.279
Well, well, well.

01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:11.412
Look at Ria's accomplishments.

01:28:11.445 --> 01:28:12.711
Get it over with.

01:28:12.744 --> 01:28:15.345
I want to be with my sister.

01:28:15.378 --> 01:28:20.611
Maren, if I kill you, who
will live to tell the tale?

01:28:20.644 --> 01:28:24.311
I'm not leaving until
everyone is dead.

01:28:24.344 --> 01:28:27.311
And some of us are
still breathing.

01:28:27.343 --> 01:28:30.378
Killing your mentor has
life-long damaging effects.

01:28:30.411 --> 01:28:33.176
I made you who you are today.

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:38.309
And I hate myself for
creating this madness.

01:28:38.343 --> 01:28:39.376
Yes.

01:28:39.409 --> 01:28:43.409
I am left to wonder why
all of this is happening.

01:28:46.508 --> 01:28:49.408
I don't know.

01:28:49.441 --> 01:28:52.440
There's usually no
reason for a massacre.

01:28:59.606 --> 01:29:01.639
Delphine
comes in with the Uzi.

01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:03.307
Sorry, girls.

01:29:03.339 --> 01:29:05.572
This time I've been chosen.

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:11.172
Giselle, Sleeping Beauty,
Juliet, and all the rest.

01:29:11.204 --> 01:29:14.437
I'm the perfect prima.

01:31:39.287 --> 01:31:41.254
A happy death.

01:31:41.286 --> 01:31:44.519
Alex, honey, get
me another glass of wine.

01:31:44.553 --> 01:31:47.220
It's empty, like always.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.153
Well, open another
one, like always.

01:32:00.251 --> 01:32:02.385
Yes, this is Wren Hayward.

01:32:02.418 --> 01:32:04.251
And my security
monitors are showing

01:32:04.283 --> 01:32:06.250
me there's rapid
gunfire happening right

01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:08.517
now at the building I co-own.

01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:10.217
The ballet school.

01:32:10.249 --> 01:32:11.083
Yes, yes.

01:32:11.117 --> 01:32:11.716
That's the one.

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:12.550
It's happened before.

01:32:12.582 --> 01:32:16.450
I think it's the
same damn ballerina.

01:32:16.483 --> 01:32:20.449
Should I meet the police
and paramedics down there?

01:32:20.483 --> 01:32:22.449
The local news is going
to want an interview,

01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:26.515
and I'm practically ready.

01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:02.602
Bravo, Maren.

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.637
Well done, darling.

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.370
You did it.

01:34:05.402 --> 01:34:08.069
You overcame your fears and
delusions without breaking

01:34:08.103 --> 01:34:10.401
a single mirror.

01:34:10.435 --> 01:34:14.002
You wrote all 12 chapters
and survived all three acts

01:34:14.034 --> 01:34:16.634
in the ballet of blood.

01:34:16.668 --> 01:34:17.567
I'm proud of you.

01:34:22.668 --> 01:34:25.500
I did it.

01:34:25.533 --> 01:34:28.467
I'm the baroness.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.401
The baroness of blood.

01:34:35.631 --> 01:34:37.598
And I'm the baroness,

01:34:37.632 --> 01:34:38.633
the baroness of blood.

01:34:38.666 --> 01:34:39.565
The end.

01:34:42.664 --> 01:34:45.531
Whoever wrote this book
is seriously disturbed.

01:34:51.296 --> 01:34:56.663
We have a recital coming up.
We should go practice.

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.913
I thought we were
having a party.

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.580
I guess these children
have a bedtime.

01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:37.544
I hate all you ballerinas!

01:37:37.577 --> 01:37:38.444
You ruined my career.

01:37:38.476 --> 01:37:39.376
Everything.

01:37:39.411 --> 01:37:42.948
Maren, you're the one,
you fucking bitch!
