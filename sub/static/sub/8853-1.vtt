WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.060
- Yeah, baby!
- Yes.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.960
Come on now.

00:05.030 --> 00:07.430
- Wow.
- Clunker. Clunkville.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.500
- It's going on 45 minutes, guys.
- Yeah.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.230
Someone make a shot, please.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.470
- Yo, dude.
- Hey, ders.

00:12.530 --> 00:15.200
Who can make a smaller face?

00:15.270 --> 00:17.640
- Adam.
- Thank you.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.440
- That's right, dude.
- That's nothing to be proud of.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.110
You owe me
a buck or two for that.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.910
On to more important things.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.380
Do you guys know
what sexting is?

00:24.450 --> 00:26.250
Yeah, I heard of that.
Sexting, for sure.

00:26.310 --> 00:27.710
Okay, cool, 'cause I think.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.950
- I just got super deep into it.
- Really?

00:29.020 --> 00:30.220
Well, apparently, I met

00:30.280 --> 00:31.180
some girl named Annette
last night.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.290
I was pretty drunk,

00:32.350 --> 00:34.320
so I don't really remember her,

00:34.390 --> 00:36.490
but she's been sexting me
all morning.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.060
So she goes, "what happened
to you last night?

00:38.130 --> 00:39.560
You bailed on me."

00:39.630 --> 00:40.560
Oh, that's not like you, dude.

00:40.630 --> 00:41.930
- I know.
- No.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.200
So I go, "sorry.
What are you doing now?"

00:43.260 --> 00:44.600
She says, "nothing."

00:44.670 --> 00:46.170
So I go,
"well, we're having a shindig.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.800
- You ought to come by."
- Yeah.

00:47.870 --> 00:49.640
She goes, "I'll think about it.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.810
In the meantime,
you can think about this."

00:52.870 --> 00:54.770
Boom.
Whoa-ho!

00:54.840 --> 00:56.780
Nipple.
Nipple shot.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.040
That is a good-looking nipple,
bro.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.410
Totally a nipple.
Great job.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.010
That's the nipple of my dreams.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.380
Why don't you get her
over here, man?

01:02.450 --> 01:03.850
Send her a pic of your dick.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.120
Okay.
Um, she just sent me

01:06.190 --> 01:07.050
a picture of her nipple,

01:07.120 --> 01:08.550
so I'm not sure...

01:08.620 --> 01:10.060
Well, that's the order
of things.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.860
It goes nipple, dick,
, butt hole.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.360
Oh, okay, all right,
well, I mean,

01:13.430 --> 01:14.590
I've never done...
wait, whose butt hole?

01:14.660 --> 01:16.060
<i>Dude, I saw it
on dateline.</i>

01:16.130 --> 01:17.560
Why don't you get some blood
in that sucker?

01:17.630 --> 01:18.460
- Seal the deal.
- Come on, man.

01:18.530 --> 01:19.500
Seal the deal, dude.

01:19.570 --> 01:21.170
All right, I'll do it.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.700
- Go handle that.
- I'm gonna seal the deal.

01:22.770 --> 01:23.870
Get rid of that hat.

01:26.970 --> 01:28.940
<i>Gq time.
Gq time.</i>

01:29.010 --> 01:31.210
<i>Everybody, time
to get gq time.</i>

01:31.280 --> 01:35.080
Oh, man, are you gonna have sex
with this girl, Anders?

01:35.150 --> 01:36.920
Oh, yeah.

01:36.980 --> 01:38.450
- Man-ufique.
- Nice.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.520
Oh, okay,
that's definitely illegal.

01:41.590 --> 01:44.420
- That was good.
- Countdown to vagina town.

01:44.490 --> 01:46.160
- Yeah, baby!
- All right.

01:46.230 --> 01:47.330
Uh-huh.

01:47.390 --> 01:48.860
I also washed my rear end

01:48.930 --> 01:50.360
in case I got to take
that picture later.

01:50.430 --> 01:51.730
Wow. You did that.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.970
Awesome.
Great.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.270
- Very cool.
- Whose phone is that?

01:54.330 --> 01:55.900
- That's cool.
- Oh, thanks.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.100
It's Vanessa's actually.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.100
She just got a text from you.

01:58.170 --> 01:59.670
That's kind of weird.

01:59.740 --> 02:03.410
Select all contacts.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.980
And send.

02:05.050 --> 02:06.880
Vanessa, thanks for the phone.

02:06.950 --> 02:08.449
Enjoy your new wallpaper.

02:14.860 --> 02:15.890
That's his.
That's his dick.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.220
Right here.

02:17.290 --> 02:18.890
The nipple of your dreams

02:18.960 --> 02:21.390
is actually my nipple
of your nightmares.

02:21.460 --> 02:25.060
Oh, right? Yeah.

02:25.130 --> 02:27.130
- Oh, that's embarrassing.
- This isn't funny.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.670
There was a weird shadow.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.340
The lighting in the bathroom
is strange.

02:33.510 --> 02:34.470
♪

02:34.540 --> 02:35.910
♪ I'm fresh ♪

02:35.980 --> 02:37.180
♪♪

02:37.240 --> 02:38.410

02:38.480 --> 02:39.510

02:39.580 --> 02:42.380

02:42.450 --> 02:44.450
Oh, nice.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.920
Dude, how are you gonna get down
from the roof?

02:46.990 --> 02:49.820
- You're gonna be hammered.
- So this is

02:49.890 --> 02:51.290
where my friends are.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.390
Hey, look who it is.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.490
It's dick-tembe mutombo.

02:55.630 --> 02:56.560
Look who it is. It's...

02:56.630 --> 02:59.970
Your dick is so tan, bro!

03:00.030 --> 03:02.770
- No.
- No? You didn't like that one?

03:02.840 --> 03:05.400
You know, when you kick
a dude and he's already down,

03:05.470 --> 03:09.140
he's not likely to share
his blunt with you.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.740
You don't smoke.

03:10.810 --> 03:11.810
I just bought this from a girl,

03:11.880 --> 03:13.310
and I'm smoking it tonight.

03:13.380 --> 03:14.610
You're gonna smoke
with us, right?

03:14.680 --> 03:15.880
I don't have to.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.220
Dude, you should be thanking us

03:18.290 --> 03:20.420
because, without us,
all of those super hot chicks

03:20.490 --> 03:21.590
wouldn't have seen your...

03:21.660 --> 03:23.190
Tan dick.

03:23.260 --> 03:24.160
Yeah, I heard a girl down there

03:24.220 --> 03:25.890
talking about you, man.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.030
It's basically
like you're rounding third base

03:28.100 --> 03:29.830
headed for home.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.560
Wait, was it Vanessa?

03:31.630 --> 03:33.000
She's got tattoos, man.
I'm into that lately.

03:33.070 --> 03:34.070
Oh, here we go.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.700
There's something about ink...

03:35.770 --> 03:38.340
Poop dollar!
There's poop in it!

03:38.410 --> 03:40.710
There's poop in the dollar!

03:40.770 --> 03:41.910
All right,
whose poop this time?

03:41.980 --> 03:44.740
- Oh, that's all Adam.
- Gross.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.110
It's weird how unembarrassed
I am by that.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.880
Come on, guys.
This is a Sunday fun day.

03:49.950 --> 03:53.020
Let's get...
Crazy!

03:53.090 --> 03:55.150
Oh, yeah.

03:59.190 --> 04:00.460
ah-ha-ha!

04:00.530 --> 04:03.460
Cool.

04:03.530 --> 04:05.260
It's early in the morning.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.400
I'm not gonna eat
a pepperoni pizza.

04:08.470 --> 04:09.900
This is the kind
of fertilizer...

04:09.970 --> 04:12.410
You don't want to lay down
a thick layer.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.610
I understand
that you're in the bathtub,

04:14.680 --> 04:17.810
and if you could just get out,
dry yourself off...

04:17.880 --> 04:19.279
Are you guys freaking out?

04:19.350 --> 04:20.810
Okay, now I am, Jillian.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.120
Why don't you chill out?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.480
Sorry, it's just you guys
don't at all look ready

04:25.550 --> 04:27.950
for the drug test today.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.390
Wait, there's a drug test
today?

04:29.460 --> 04:31.560
Yeah, I know.
I'm freaking out too.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.560
Last night I went
to the Justin bieber concert

04:33.630 --> 04:36.230
with my nephew Dennis,
and this guy was smoking weed

04:36.300 --> 04:37.400
right next to us.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.070
Totally freaked me out.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.670
Hey, you know
what else freaked me out?

04:40.730 --> 04:42.200
That picture of your dick,
Anders.

04:42.270 --> 04:43.870
I got it in a text.

04:43.940 --> 04:45.570
How didn't we know
about this drug test?

04:45.640 --> 04:47.370
We smoked yesterday.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.380
Dude, we smoked in the car
this morning.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.910
- Alice!
- Alice!

04:51.980 --> 04:53.580
- Yo, boss lady.
- Good morning.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.880
Looking large and in charge.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.750
Minus the large, plus points

04:57.820 --> 04:59.990
for being cool.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.550
Shut up, Adam.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.090
God, I cannot believe
we are wasting our time

05:03.160 --> 05:05.190
with this pointless drug test
yet again.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.560
Oh, yeah, there's that today.

05:06.630 --> 05:08.390
We don't have a problem
with that.

05:08.460 --> 05:09.530
Look, you guys know
what I'm about.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.260
Putting up the numbers.

05:11.330 --> 05:12.570
That's right.
I put up the numbers

05:12.630 --> 05:13.730
like you put your thumbs
up each other's butts.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.900
Besides, this drug test
is a joke.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.500
I can't have my sales force
running to the bathroom

05:17.570 --> 05:19.470
every five minutes
like a bunch of bulimics.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.710
You don't have
to worry about us

05:20.770 --> 05:23.340
because we are straight
as arrows.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.510
We should be in quivers
because we're straight

05:25.580 --> 05:27.450
like as arr... we should...

05:27.510 --> 05:29.720
We're archers.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.390
Okay, look, I know what is
going on out there, okay.

05:32.450 --> 05:33.620
But you need to grow
the "f" up!

05:33.690 --> 05:34.850
Speaking of growing,

05:34.920 --> 05:36.360
wait till you see the boner

05:36.420 --> 05:38.160
they sent over
from the testing company.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.230
Knock, knock.
Is this the vip lounge?

05:40.290 --> 05:42.830
Oh, and there he is.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.730
- Hi, guys.
- Guys, this is Robbie.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.330
Yeah, Robbie.
Best test in the west.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.430
He likes to say that.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.100
Best test in the west Robbie.

05:50.170 --> 05:51.370
There he goes.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.410
It's just a drug test,

05:52.470 --> 05:53.770
so nothing to be scared of.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.110
I'm excited.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.610
What kind of drugs
are we testing?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.640
What?

05:58.710 --> 06:01.010
- That was a joke.
- Oh, I love jokes.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.520
- That's funny.
- Okay, well,

06:02.580 --> 06:04.520
I'm just gonna let you guys
pal around.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.820
And I'm gonna get away
from you.

06:06.890 --> 06:07.920
Okay.

06:07.990 --> 06:12.020
Bye, Alice.

06:12.090 --> 06:14.560
You might have her fooled,
but not me.

06:14.630 --> 06:17.660
I recognize burnouts
when I see 'em.

06:17.730 --> 06:20.930
I'm a professional.
I'm a friggin' bloodhound.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.370
And I can see the signs...
the glazed eyes,

06:23.440 --> 06:27.940
the ridiculous j. Crew outfit.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.840
And you, strawberry shortcake,

06:31.910 --> 06:35.850
I can't wait to get deep
inside that urinary tract

06:35.920 --> 06:38.020
of a river of pee
and just see what kind

06:38.090 --> 06:41.390
of mistakes you've been making
in your own life.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.420
Oh, mama,
I'm gonna have fun with you.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.900
So, um, I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

06:55.990 --> 06:58.830
I found this stuff
called niacin.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.160
It's supposed to flush
the toxins out of your system.

07:01.230 --> 07:03.170
I could start a fire,
burn this place down.

07:03.230 --> 07:04.870
One time, when I was a kid,

07:04.940 --> 07:07.100
I literally did this
for, like, 45 minutes

07:07.170 --> 07:08.810
and I started a fire.

07:08.870 --> 07:10.870
My clubhouse went up in flames.
Feel that.

07:10.940 --> 07:12.280
- That was a cool dance.
- Yeah. Thank you.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.880
What's your idea, dude?

07:13.940 --> 07:14.780
You gonna give us
some egg salad sandwiches

07:14.850 --> 07:16.650
out of that little cooler?

07:16.710 --> 07:18.850
No, I was thinking
maybe two tall glasses

07:18.920 --> 07:21.950
of 100% clean urine.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.520
- What?
- Yeah.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.260
I knew about the drug test.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.060
Because they announced it
two months ago.

07:28.130 --> 07:31.190
And me being your friend,
stocked up for you.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.430
'Cause you guys
are drug addicts.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.300
But then you had to pull

07:34.370 --> 07:36.030
yesterday's
little sexting prank.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.470
And now I don't think
you deserve it.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.570
But I'll let you earn it.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.340
- Name it.
- Bear with me here.

07:44.410 --> 07:48.850
I thought about this
last night.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.690
- Eat this.
- No. Thank you.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.260
- That is danger.
- Give me the damn tile.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.490
Okay, sure.
I really hate you for this.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.160
- Enjoy that.
- You know

08:05.230 --> 08:06.260
how this is gonna feel
coming out?

08:06.330 --> 08:07.760
- Feast.
- Probably not good.

08:07.830 --> 08:09.100
It's gonna make
our butt holes bleed.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.470
- Thanks.
- Chow down.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.700
Ugh!

08:13.770 --> 08:16.710
Oh, wow,
that's a big first bite.

08:16.770 --> 08:18.040
That's a really big first bite.

08:18.110 --> 08:19.640
It's so dry.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.540
It's like a mummy's dick.

08:21.610 --> 08:24.210
And this guy, you better
catch up with your friend.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.550
You're a real son of a bitch.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.250
Speaking of ketchup,

08:27.320 --> 08:28.590
get the arby-q sauce on it,
huh?

08:33.460 --> 08:35.559
All right, you guys...
you guys have had enough.

08:35.630 --> 08:38.860
Uh, why don't you
just wash it down, champs?

08:38.929 --> 08:40.429
- That's piss.
- That is urine.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.270
- We're not gonna drink piss.
- No, thank you.

08:42.330 --> 08:43.799
No, no, no, this is gatorade.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.670
See, that's what happens
when you mess

08:45.740 --> 08:47.300
with the mastermind of pranks.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.270
- Okay, wow.
- You pull a prank on me,

08:49.340 --> 08:52.010
you get pranked back.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.110
All right?
Here is the real piss.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.850
And it's all mine.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.720
It's all...

09:00.790 --> 09:03.150
Over your face.
What?

09:03.220 --> 09:05.190
- What?
- That was stupid.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.720
You're stupid, bro.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.160
You've got piss
on your face, dude.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.060
Adam, I had enough
for all three of us.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.590
I was gonna let the joke
run a little longer

09:11.660 --> 09:13.460
and then split it up,
but now it's gone.

09:13.530 --> 09:15.060
And a little bit in my mouth.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.570
Why didn't you
tell me that then?

09:16.630 --> 09:18.740
Because I was trying
to be cool and dramatic,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.470
which you would know
nothing about.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.040
Oh, I don't know about being
cool and dramatic, dude?

09:22.110 --> 09:23.940
Who's saving up to buy
a motorcycle,

09:24.010 --> 09:25.880
a crotch rocket,
and a cool leather jacket?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.310
- I am!
- I don't care.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.010
- I can't talk to you.
- Screw you.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.910
Oh, no.
What's wrong, guys?

09:30.980 --> 09:32.720
You seem a little jumpy.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.850
Why don't we just go ahead
and get you guys fired

09:34.920 --> 09:37.890
so you can spend the rest
of the day getting all high?

09:37.960 --> 09:39.720
That actually sounds awesome.

09:39.790 --> 09:40.790
I can hear you whispering.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.390
I know you can hear me.

09:42.460 --> 09:43.690
I'm doing it loud enough
for you to hear me.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.500
Oh, really?
Well, can you hear this?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.900
- What?
- You have until 5:00

09:47.970 --> 09:51.530
to make with the zip,
the flop, the splash,

09:51.600 --> 09:53.870
- and the boo-hoo.
- What was the flop?

09:53.940 --> 09:57.270
The flop is the penis coming
out of the slacks or trousers.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.840
Oh.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.280
So then the boo-hoo
is just, like,

10:00.340 --> 10:03.480
an extra, like, poop afterwards
or something?

10:03.550 --> 10:04.880
I'm done with you amateurs.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.620
I got a pee cart
coming through!

10:18.030 --> 10:20.730
Dude, this guy is ruthless.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.500
I will not move back in
with my mom.

10:22.570 --> 10:25.240
I will sell every drop
of my blood for money.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.840
We've got an hour lunch.
We'll figure something out.

10:30.010 --> 10:31.710
Waymond.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.710
Hey, Karl, what's up, brother?

10:33.780 --> 10:35.250
Do you know
where we can get some niacin

10:35.310 --> 10:37.310
- in the next hour?
- Yo, let me drive.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.820
- No.
- You have some now?

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
- Where you at?
- How come you always get

10:39.950 --> 10:41.520
to drive, dude?

10:41.590 --> 10:42.450
Because he doesn't even have
a license,

10:42.520 --> 10:43.750
and you have a dui.

10:43.820 --> 10:44.850
Sweet.
We'll see you in ten.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.290
So where to?

10:46.360 --> 10:47.420
Our house.

10:47.490 --> 10:48.660
You let a drug dealer

10:48.730 --> 10:49.760
stay in our house all day?

10:49.830 --> 10:51.830
He feeds my turtles, Anders.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.400
- Ow. Karl.
- Hey, Karl, what's up?

10:55.470 --> 10:57.700
<i>It's almost the ending, bro.
It's die hard.</i>

10:57.770 --> 10:59.300
Did they just say "clucking"?

10:59.370 --> 11:00.770
Yeah, it must be on cable,

11:00.840 --> 11:02.570
so they switched
the swear words out.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.380
Oh, Carl winslow.
I forgot about him.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.340
Did you know that Reginald
veljohnson wasn't actually...

11:07.410 --> 11:08.880
Shut the cluck up.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.450
.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.960
"Come out to the coast,

11:21.030 --> 11:22.990
we'll get together,
have a few laughs."

11:23.060 --> 11:24.400
It's a movie, dude.

11:24.460 --> 11:25.900
You can't climb
through an air duct.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.400
This movie's based on a book.

11:27.470 --> 11:28.730
Books don't lie.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.570
Um, Blake,
did you need that niacin

11:30.640 --> 11:32.540
for some reason, bro?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.010
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, man.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.740
- See ya, Karl.
- See ya.

11:36.810 --> 11:38.510
Hey, ders.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.510
I just got that stuff
at the drug store, man.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.980
That's great. Just don't touch
any of my things.

11:43.050 --> 11:43.980
What? Why not?

11:44.050 --> 11:45.280
Because your fingernails

11:45.350 --> 11:47.150
are gross.

11:47.220 --> 11:52.020
Oh.
He is absolutely right.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.660
It says here to take two
for results in eight hours.

11:54.730 --> 11:58.200
That means we should take eight
for results in two.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.430
Yup. All right,
let's crank the heat up

12:01.500 --> 12:02.930
- and sweat this bitch out.
- Wait a second.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.470
Guys, these aren't
flintstone vitamins.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.600
There's probably side effects.

12:05.670 --> 12:07.040
Let me see the bottle.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.440
Yeah, see, redness,

12:08.510 --> 12:10.370
itching of the skin.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.310
You guys sweating yet or what?

12:11.380 --> 12:12.780
'Cause I got swamp nuts.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.940
Yeah, boy!

12:14.010 --> 12:15.680
I'm about ready to keep my job

12:15.750 --> 12:17.380
and get a paycheck, son.

12:17.450 --> 12:19.480
- Whatever.
- You know this.

12:19.550 --> 12:22.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if this doesn't work, man?

12:22.490 --> 12:25.520
- We need clean piss.
- Ugh!

12:25.590 --> 12:27.320
I had clean piss already.
Remember?

12:27.390 --> 12:29.660
- I had it.
- Maybe we could find somebody

12:29.730 --> 12:30.790
- to give us clean piss.
- How are we supposed to find

12:30.860 --> 12:32.500
someone to give us clean piss

12:32.560 --> 12:36.030
when everyone over the age of 12
smokes weed these days?

12:41.240 --> 12:44.540
Hey, kids, you gotta go pee?

12:44.610 --> 12:45.910
Pigtails, I'm talking to you.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.710
We have candy.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.250
Guys, guys, come on.
Look at our faces.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.350
We're just scaring these kids.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.120
Why don't we go somewhere

12:52.180 --> 12:53.380
where we can actually get
some clean piss?

12:53.450 --> 12:55.220
- Okay.
- Hey, I'll give you some piss.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.620
- You will?
- Yeah.

12:56.690 --> 12:57.960
Maybe I need to go.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.290

- Hey!
- Oh, no, sorry.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.840
I get that too.
That's my tip.

18:49.910 --> 18:51.540
- Great.
- All right.

18:51.610 --> 18:54.210
- Enjoy that.
- I will. Bye-bye.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.310
Nice doing business
with you guys.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.220
All right, see ya.

19:01.250 --> 19:04.290
Poop dollar, biotch!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.790
Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

19:05.860 --> 19:07.490
I still have a job.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.160
I'm Robbie!
I'm best in the west!

19:15.430 --> 19:18.340
Tell me, how does one screw up

19:18.400 --> 19:20.170
this badly?

19:20.240 --> 19:22.940
I understand the results

19:23.010 --> 19:24.570
were a little off.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.680
Oh. Every employee
has tested positive

19:26.740 --> 19:29.580
Marijuana, mdma,

19:29.650 --> 19:32.450
pcp, hgh, Lipitor,

19:32.520 --> 19:34.850
Adderall, dayquil, nyquil...

19:34.920 --> 19:36.750
Why would anyone take both?

19:36.820 --> 19:39.660
Nitrous oxide, benzedrine,
Valtrex, Flomax,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.520
Cialis, and birth control.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.460
Thanks for bringing
that up, buddy.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.960
I can't have kids.
Don't need birth control.

19:46.030 --> 19:47.200
- I didn't know.
- Look, I want you

19:47.270 --> 19:48.630
to get on your hobby cart

19:48.700 --> 19:50.300
and ride your ass
out of this office

19:50.370 --> 19:51.770
before I grab Orlando's vacuum

19:51.840 --> 19:54.470
and I shove it up your ass
on full suction.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.670
It was great doing business
with you.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.340
Jillian!

19:58.410 --> 20:00.310
Hi.
How can I help?

20:00.380 --> 20:02.080
Shut up.
I need you to draft an email

20:02.150 --> 20:05.520
to all employees apologizing
for today's drug test.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.220
The results were inconclusive,

20:07.290 --> 20:08.590
and we're gonna have
a new round tomorrow.

20:08.650 --> 20:11.890
Just a strand of hair.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.120
Why are you still staring
at me?

20:14.190 --> 20:16.390
I'm sorry about the kid thing.
I couldn't help...

20:16.460 --> 20:18.700
Why aren't you typing?

20:18.760 --> 20:21.230
I can't have pets
in my apartment building.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.470
So...
Right.

20:23.530 --> 20:25.470
Email. Hair.
Got it.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.640
Whoo!

20:26.700 --> 20:27.970
She had a space nut

20:28.040 --> 20:29.340
like a cosmonaut

20:29.410 --> 20:30.510
whatcha know about me being

20:30.570 --> 20:31.940
the cosmo robot.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.980
- Whoa.

20:34.050 --> 20:37.080
