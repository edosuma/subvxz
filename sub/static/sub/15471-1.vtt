02:23.400 --> 02:25.436
<i>I think about the day we met.</i>

02:26.440 --> 02:29.432
<i>I suppose you arrived par avion.</i>

02:30.160 --> 02:32.949
<i>Maybe you were the first
to get to security.</i>

02:35.320 --> 02:37.151
<i>You didn't intend to stay.</i>

02:37.400 --> 02:40.839
<i>You only had 24 hour coverage
so only carry-ons.</i>

02:40.840 --> 02:43.159
<i>And they probably had
a driver waiting</i>

02:43.160 --> 02:45.230
<i>so you didn't have to find
a car.</i>

02:55.040 --> 02:58.599
<i>You'd never been to Shanghai before,
it was all new to you.</i>

02:58.600 --> 03:00.511
How do people live out here?

03:00.960 --> 03:03.758
It's not living, just existing.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.158
<i>- You ever liveafuera?
- No.</i>

03:13.960 --> 03:15.439
Can I have your cover please?

03:19.800 --> 03:24.119
Candies, sherbet fountains,
cigarettes, batteries, hair cuts.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.718
- Hair cuts? Never seen that before!
- I'll show you.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.391
- Give me two sherbet fountains.
- Two sherbet fountains.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.679
Take me in, mister. I can do haircuts.
I'm wasted out here.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.432
You got a spare cover?

03:42.880 --> 03:44.711
I only cover for one.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.799
- I'm sorry.
- You want to swap places with me?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.879
- You?
- I wear the suit, you wear this.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.871
It's tempting! Good luck.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.633
- What's your name?
- Nabil.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.074
Bye.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.399
I don't think it's a good idea
to encourage them.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.989
If people can't get cover,
there's a reason.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.875
<i>You arrived in the morning
so the streets were deserted.</i>

04:56.120 --> 04:59.990
<i>Did you call anyone?
Did you have a cerveza?</i>

05:00.280 --> 05:04.919
<i>I imagine you watching the news,
sometimes playing a game,</i>

05:04.920 --> 05:06.638
<i>sometimes sleeping,</i>

05:06.920 --> 05:09.959
<i>mentally preparing yourself
for the night ahead.</i>

05:11.680 --> 05:16.358
<i>The thing I can't imagine is that we
hadn't met or heard of each other.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:21.270
<i>That you thought it was going to be
just another night.</i>

05:32.040 --> 05:33.996
<i>Happy birthday, Maria.</i>

05:34.240 --> 05:36.037
<i>Time to wake up.</i>

05:38.680 --> 05:41.752
<i>It was my birthday, which I hate.</i>

05:47.240 --> 05:52.236
<i>Every year on my birthday, I have
a dream, always the same dream.</i>

05:52.920 --> 05:56.278
<i>I go down into the subway.
I wait for the train.</i>

05:57.080 --> 05:59.036
<i>I'm worried I'm going to be late.</i>

06:00.280 --> 06:01.998
<i>The train leaves the station.</i>

06:02.640 --> 06:06.589
<i>I feel like going to sleep,
but I have to find someone...</i>

06:09.040 --> 06:10.917
<i>... before the train stops.</i>

06:11.840 --> 06:15.915
<i>The train goes through one station,
nineteen more to go.</i>

06:16.080 --> 06:17.593
<i>I have to find him.</i>

06:18.480 --> 06:19.913
<i>And then I wake up.</i>

06:20.200 --> 06:24.036
<i>Happy birthday, Maria.
Time to wake up!</i>

06:31.800 --> 06:34.799
<i>The next year I had exactly
the same dream,</i>

06:34.800 --> 06:37.794
<i>only this time
I went past two stations.</i>

06:38.800 --> 06:43.910
<i>Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew
there were eighteen stations to go.</i>

06:44.520 --> 06:47.992
<i>The next year seventeen,
the next year sixteen.</i>

06:48.400 --> 06:50.595
<i>Every birthday, one less.</i>

06:53.600 --> 06:57.629
<i>Today's my birthday,
today I'm down to the last one.</i>

06:59.000 --> 07:02.519
<i>If I fall asleep,
I'll get to my destination.</i>

07:02.520 --> 07:06.708
<i>If I want to, I can discover
my fate tonight.</i>

07:09.800 --> 07:11.711
- Lo siento.
- That's okay.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.632
<i>So, what am I going to do?</i>

07:19.280 --> 07:21.350
<i>I'm going to stay awake all day.</i>

07:22.200 --> 07:26.798
<i>Who wants to discover their fate?
Who'll take a chance like that?</i>

07:27.160 --> 07:30.959
- I'm here to see Mr. Backland.
- I'll send someone along for you.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.679
I'm here on an investigation and
I'd find it useful to wander around.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.594
- All visitors have to be accompanied.
- I know...

07:40.200 --> 07:45.919
- Just let me do my job.
- If I did, I wouldn't be doing mine.

07:45.920 --> 07:51.479
That is a conundrum.
If I could figure out your password...

07:51.480 --> 07:55.319
- You couldn't do it.
- I need one piece of information.

07:55.320 --> 08:00.669
- Is this some kind of trick?
- No, tell me one thing about you.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.155
Anything at all.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.713
My birthday.
My palabra is not my birthday. 29.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.076
Your palabra is Carrefour.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.958
Crossroad, carrefour.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.797
- How did you know that?
- Can I register now?

08:15.080 --> 08:18.759
I listened to you while you weren't
speaking. Don't worry about it.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.239
- I could get into a lot of trouble.
- I'll go straight to his office.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.470
Don't worry about it.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.317
- William Geld? Salaam.
- Mr. Backland?

08:40.440 --> 08:44.279
You caught me off guard,
I wanted to greet you properly.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.717
I guess that's one of your skills,
cunning.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.750
I have no cunning, I'm afraid.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.194
- This is your first visit?
- Yes.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.873
Do you have time to see the mammoth?

08:58.600 --> 09:04.239
We specialize in short-term cover
certificates for specific tasks.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.679
A parachute jump,
maybe a medical procedure.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.231
People only buy fakes if we won't
grant legitimate cover.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.879
If we won't grant legitimate cover,
there's a reason.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.314
"The sphinx knows best."

09:18.680 --> 09:24.154
Fake cover is a ticket
to avoidable suffering.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.119
We know which printer
the fakes come from.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.112
Each printer
has its own fingerprint.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.519
This one
is from a number eight printer.

09:34.520 --> 09:38.719
Only a few people can use it,
it has to be one of them.

09:38.720 --> 09:43.319
I need a quiet room and some time,
I'll have this done by this evening.

09:43.320 --> 09:48.439
It's a happy workplace,
I don't want to create an atmosphere.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.919
I don't want anyone to know
what's going on.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.390
Why? Tell them the truth, Larry.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.999
Tell me something about yourself.
Anything at all.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.470
I was born in Napally Road, Hyderabad.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.950
Tell me something about yourself.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.428
Anything?

10:14.040 --> 10:17.352
Try to make it interesting,
I've got a long day ahead of me.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.799
I have una cosa for freckles.
A sexual cosa.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.836
I find freckles a turn on.

10:27.760 --> 10:32.358
Freckled skin, it's like it's clothed
and not clothed.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.160
There's no freckle pornography.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.030
Women get famous for breasts and legs.
But not for freckles.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.828
- There's "Anne of Green Gables."
- I regard that as an erotic classic.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.754
The Normans...

10:48.000 --> 10:49.433
amazing!

10:50.560 --> 10:54.635
They invented the whole English
language out of nothing but French.

10:54.920 --> 10:59.711
- And some Latin, obviously.
- Obviously.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.755
There's a girl here, Maria.
She's tone deaf.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.071
She can't hold a tune
to save her life.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.879
That's beautiful.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.872
Don't you think?

11:17.320 --> 11:20.757
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking, have we met before?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.953
Upstairs, at the foyer,
we almost bumped into each other.

11:24.960 --> 11:29.911
- I feel I know you.
- One thing, one thing about yourself.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.639
I don't know if I want you to know
something about me.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.439
I can never think of anything when
people ask me straight out.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.679
- You want to prompt me?
- It won't work if I prompted you.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.671
What won't work?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.716
Tell me what you're doing
later tonight.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.713
- That's a question or an invitation?
- It's a prompt.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.836
Tonight, I'm going to stay awake,

12:02.120 --> 12:03.792
till the sun goes down.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.277
I'm not going to sleep.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.349
- Why?
- It's my birthday.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.671
Happy birthday.

12:24.160 --> 12:28.712
I'm going to need to take your
information, for future reference.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.913
It's difficult

12:38.080 --> 12:41.759
when you can get a big denarius
for a piece of paper.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.557
It's a big temptation.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.111
Are you sure it's him?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.679
I thought it might be her.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.918
I don't think so.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.712
Do you have evidence?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.029
I don't need to give you evidence,
it's intuition you're paying me for.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.351
Are you okay?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.913
Absolutely.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.837
- Am I under surveillance?
- No.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.874
Do you want to go out with me?

14:56.680 --> 14:59.639
It's your birthday,
don't you have other plans?

14:59.640 --> 15:03.953
Yes, I have to meet someone later
but I'm hungry.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.953
- Let's go and eat.
- Alright.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.716
<i>I was never scared of you,
even when I should have been.</i>

15:14.160 --> 15:16.310
<i>Even when my fate was in your hands,</i>

15:16.560 --> 15:18.676
<i>I always trusted you.</i>

15:22.600 --> 15:24.477
So why do you do it?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.592
For the money.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.753
- Why did you do it?
- What?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.752
Lie for me.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.229
I don't know.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.994
It's very impulsive.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.951
I can be impulsive.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.032
Happy birthday.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.953
I love these, how did you know?

15:48.240 --> 15:50.231
Out of my file?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.949
- A lucky guess.
- Fate.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.039
Actually, I have
a whole bag full of them.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.029
For my kid.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.515
- You have a kid?
- Yes.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.398
- A boy!
- Yes.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.831
His name is Jim.

16:07.240 --> 16:11.474
- I bet he's very special.
- He is special.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.111
Everybody's children are special.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.190
It makes you wonder where all
the ordinary grown-ups come from.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.712
These are good!

16:23.720 --> 16:28.398
- Do you want to come to a club?
- Don't you have to meet someone?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.715
- Come, I want you to.
- Why?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.152
I want to corrupt you.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.719
If you come, there's a definite risk
you'll have a good time.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.916
If you don't come with me...

16:42.080 --> 16:43.354
then you'll regret it.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.715
Come on.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.519
Vodka with ice, please.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.479
Would you like to sing a song?
Are you sure?

17:24.480 --> 17:27.269
- I'm sure.
- You don't want to hear me sing.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.319
Actually, I was hoping
to hear you sing.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.998
- Why?
- I heard you have distinctive voice.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.999
What else did they say about me
behind my back?

17:44.000 --> 17:48.679
Did you know you can take a virus
that can make you more musical?

17:48.680 --> 17:52.879
- You sing like an angel.
- I did once for Mandarin Chinese.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.512
Chinese people knew what I was saying
but I didn't. Weird!

18:01.240 --> 18:05.399
I'm on a virus right now,
an empathy virus.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.279
I take an empathy virus
to help with my work.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.839
I don't like that, that's weird.
You could pick up stuff about me.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.159
I could.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.399
That's like wearing x-ray specs,
to look at girls' underwear.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.799
- I got x-ray specs, they don't work.
- But you bought them.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.639
- You wanted them to work.
- I was six years old.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.077
I was interested in skeletons,
not underwear.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.997
<i>I thought you were
a natural intuitivehombre.</i>

18:34.440 --> 18:36.317
Does it make any difference?

18:37.520 --> 18:38.509
Of course.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.591
- Really?
- The virus...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.678
Damian!

19:04.680 --> 19:07.239
William is helping me
celebrate my birthday.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.515
It's your birthday?
I didn't know.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.399
That's okay, William is okay.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.517
He knows about our secret.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.798
That's the one that will take me in!

19:20.600 --> 19:23.434
You should kiss William too,
because he helped.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.515
Tell him what you're going to do.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.478
I study bats.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.999
The best quality of bats in this world
in this cave in Delhi.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.631
I've wanted to see that
since I was a kid.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.559
You couldn't get cover
in the normal way?

19:42.560 --> 19:46.635
I've tried for eight years.
Eight years and only now am I going.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.759
Usually, if you can't get cover,
there's a good reason.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.513
- Yes, "the Sphinx knows best."
- Best.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.759
- The Sphinx knows a lot.
- It doesn't know what I know.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.999
Some things in life
can be worth the risk.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.279
Anyone who has ever wanted something
knows you have to be prepared to risk.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.271
I think I'll be okay.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.628
- See you soon.
- Bye.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.915
- Why did you do that?
- What?

20:18.200 --> 20:22.399
All that, in front of me.
You know what I should do now?

20:22.400 --> 20:26.519
I should have his cover withdrawn
and you too while I'm at it.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.549
But you're not going to you, though.
Are you?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.910
Why are you being so nice to me?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.512
Are you hoping for a reward?

20:36.160 --> 20:37.991
How did you get those papeles out?

20:43.360 --> 20:48.519
At the beginning of every new batch,
we do a test run then destroy them.

20:48.520 --> 20:51.439
So I go into work and I have
a fake pass under my tongue.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.799
I destroy the fake pass
and put the real pass under my tongue.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.839
Then I go into the bathroom,
put it into a pill and swallow it.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.755
A couple of days later...
I have the pass.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.512
Impressed?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.758
Come on, be impressed.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.477
Thanks for bringing me home.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.832
That's very kind of you.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.158
Come in.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.873
Beautiful! You have green fingers.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.358
Everything
is controlled scientifically.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.039
Do you think the sunlight
is as dangerous as they say?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.598
I hope not.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.634
- Would you like a drink, some water?
- Sure.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.359
You know that one of my fingers
is younger than the others?

23:53.360 --> 23:55.112
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.588
Which one?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.433
This one.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.239
Do you like it?

24:03.160 --> 24:07.792
Very much, it's much better
than the other fingers.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.636
Maybe I should get me a younger face.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.798
I love the sorrows
on your changing face.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.916
Or whatever it is.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.230
I haven't seen this book in a while.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.398
The friend one should have
is one's best enemy.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.994
You should be closest to him
when resisting.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.799
Look.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.479
It's all I've got left
from my childhood.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.755
I keep my special memories here.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.392
Who are they?

25:23.640 --> 25:27.510
My father and mother
before we left Shanghai.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.232
These are people like Damien,
when I give them papeles.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.990
Now you know all my secrets.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.190
I love to look at their faces.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.272
They're so beautiful.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.436
Look at their eyes.

25:50.440 --> 25:53.434
They have a look that the rest
of us don't have.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.516
You look like them a little.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.432
You should go to sleep.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.477
I don't want to go to sleep,

26:24.160 --> 26:25.559
please don't let me go to sleep.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.758
I'll make you some coffee.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.673
Coffee.

29:02.760 --> 29:06.439
I was just going to torture the song
and now you're going to murder it!

29:06.440 --> 29:10.594
I'm tone deaf, you know...
You find it attractive?

31:27.560 --> 31:28.993
Are you leaving?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.714
I'm booked on a flight home.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.398
- What time's your flight?
- 11.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.037
What happens at Bikku?

31:41.680 --> 31:43.636
He'll lose his cover.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.992
- That's bad!
- I know.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.873
You giving out fake papers
is bad...

31:52.280 --> 31:54.635
Have you ever lived outside?

31:59.360 --> 32:01.078
I was outside for ten years.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.872
I have to go.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.632
I have to go.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.152
I need to stop
at the entry checkpoint.

33:19.520 --> 33:22.830
- Why?
- To get more sherbet fountains.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.833
Hi, mister.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.399
I found this, I thought
you could put it to good use.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.312
Thanks, God bless you.
Go, go.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.392
No, I'm sorry.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.639
Leave him alone.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.552
Thanks, God bless you.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.996
<i>If we had enough information</i>

34:11.239 --> 34:15.632
<i>we could predict the consequences
of our actions.</i>

34:16.520 --> 34:18.272
<i>Would you want to know?</i>

34:18.520 --> 34:20.192
<i>If you kissed that girl,</i>

34:20.440 --> 34:22.635
<i>if you talked to that man,</i>

34:22.880 --> 34:27.359
<i>take that job, or marry that woman,
or steal that papel?</i>

34:27.360 --> 34:32.436
<i>If we knew what would happen,
would we ever take that first step?</i>

34:38.159 --> 34:39.797
Hello! I'm home.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.877
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yeah.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.999
- Where have you been?
- What are you doing awake?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.559
<i>They will be pleased to see you.
Your wife, your special boy.</i>

35:02.560 --> 35:04.799
<i>They will want to know
all your news.</i>

35:04.800 --> 35:08.875
<i>And they will be happy
to have you home, safe and sound.</i>

35:10.800 --> 35:13.395
- Shall I guess what you're thinking?
- Yes.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.514
A bicycle.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.913
<i>I can't answer right now
so leave a message.</i>

35:29.680 --> 35:34.119
It's William, call me.
Just to let me know you're okay.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.715
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.831
<i>Did you think about me at all?</i>

35:58.240 --> 36:01.799
<i>Did you try to imagine
what was happening to me?</i>

36:01.800 --> 36:05.670
<i>Does an empathy virus
work long distance?</i>

36:36.200 --> 36:40.070
<i>Maria Gonzalez, aged 25.
Employee of the Sphinx.</i>

36:41.720 --> 36:46.796
<i>Nurture father: Christian Gunter,
born in free port ofJebel Ali.</i>

36:46.920 --> 36:51.799
<i>Transferred to Shanghai and exiled
for financial irregularities.</i>

36:51.800 --> 36:57.274
<i>Registered in Kunming, Dhanbad,
Betta and Baghdad.</i>

36:57.360 --> 37:01.992
<i>He is presumed to be returning
to the free port ofJebel Ali.</i>

37:02.280 --> 37:05.877
<i>Carmen Gonzalez
returned to Shanghai,</i>

37:07.080 --> 37:09.230
<i>remarried to...</i>

37:10.040 --> 37:14.556
<i>Maria Gonzalez,
height: 165 cm...</i>

37:15.120 --> 37:18.351
- De Souza wants you.
- What about?

37:18.640 --> 37:20.551
There's been a fatality in Asia,

37:20.800 --> 37:24.439
a guy was travelling
on one of the papers from Shanghai.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.113
- Do you want a coffee?
- No, thanks.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.199
<i>- Someone died yesterday.
- I know, do you have details?</i>

37:33.200 --> 37:36.839
<i>A man had una cosa about bats,
wanted to go to Delhi.</i>

37:36.840 --> 37:39.839
<i>The place to be
if you like bats, apparently.</i>

37:39.840 --> 37:43.679
<i>He couldn't get cover because he had
an ineluctable disposition</i>

37:43.680 --> 37:45.238
to Wards disease.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.752
- Do you know it?
- No.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.399
<i>It makes you bleed to death.</i>

37:49.640 --> 37:53.759
<i>Most people in Delhi are immune
which is why he couldn't get cover.</i>

37:53.760 --> 37:55.955
<i>Which is why he bought fake papeles,</i>

37:56.400 --> 37:58.559
<i>which is why
he bled to death yesterday.</i>

37:58.560 --> 38:02.430
<i>- What was his name?
- Damian Alekan.</i>

38:03.920 --> 38:08.472
<i>The papeles are from the same
printer as the one you investigated.</i>

38:11.080 --> 38:12.035
I'm sorry.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.879
<i>Get back on a plane, make it right,
so you won't be sorry anymore.</i>

38:15.880 --> 38:19.439
<i>- There's someone else you can send?
- Why would you want me to do that?</i>

38:19.440 --> 38:24.356
I had some trouble when I was there,
some trouble with the virus, I think.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.675
<i>We all have problems, William.</i>

38:27.920 --> 38:31.519
<i>The way we deal with them
is a measure of our worth.</i>

38:31.520 --> 38:32.748
<i>Go back tomorrow.</i>

38:58.040 --> 38:59.917
Where did you get that from?

39:00.160 --> 39:01.991
I have to get back to Shanghai.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.553
- How long will you be away?
- I got 24 hour cover.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.877
I'll be back before you know I'm gone.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.473
There have been three papeles
reported.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.588
One here, one in San Paolo,
one in Delhi.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.799
If this doesn't stop,
I'm going to lose my own cover.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.399
I'm sorry. This is the first time
my intuition's let me down.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.279
I think he had an accomplice.
A certain Maria Gonzalez.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.077
She's gone.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.995
What do you mean gone?
Disappeared?

40:52.320 --> 40:56.235
I was told she had a body issue.
It was all official.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.589
Video Listo Corporation.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.919
Hello, I just tried to get into
my apartment and it won't work.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.359
<i>We have your number listed
as temporarily discontinued.</i>

41:26.360 --> 41:31.879
<i>- Do I look discontinued to you?
- No, but you may be the holder.</i>

41:31.880 --> 41:34.879
<i>- That's not my problem, is it?
- Give me your palabra.</i>

41:34.880 --> 41:39.479
<i>I'll provide you with a terminate
window to re- code your video listo.</i>

41:39.480 --> 41:40.754
That'd be great, thank you.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.070
<i>- Your palabra?
- Panoplia.</i>

41:50.240 --> 41:52.676
<i>Did you know
what you were looking for?</i>

41:52.880 --> 41:55.235
<i>Were you hoping
I'd left you a clue?</i>

41:55.480 --> 42:00.476
<i>Like Hansel and Gretel
being dragged off into the woods.</i>

42:01.960 --> 42:03.154
Panoplia.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.353
<i>Maria, today
you have no appointments.</i>

42:16.360 --> 42:21.675
<i>Maria, today you have
a 3:15 at the Mai Lin clinic.</i>

42:31.400 --> 42:35.559
I'm investigating a fraud to which
Maria Gonzalez is a key witness.

42:35.560 --> 42:40.431
I was officially informed that she has
body issues and was unhappy.

42:40.480 --> 42:45.954
She has been relocated. There were
complications we couldn't deal with.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.752
<i>She has been sent afuera.</i>

42:48.240 --> 42:52.519
Outside is a big place. It would help
if you were more specific.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.879
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.677
What was the nature
of her body issue?

42:58.920 --> 43:02.199
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.160
Why was she summoned
for happiness break?

43:05.440 --> 43:10.519
Is this a training exercise?
Are you trying to catch me out?

43:10.520 --> 43:13.279
- You got me!
- You didn't get me, though.

43:13.280 --> 43:17.796
You were top of the class,
very good.

43:18.880 --> 43:23.353
Tell me something about yourself.
For the report, I have to write this.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.792
My mother had this job before me,

43:28.200 --> 43:30.077
I inherited it.

43:32.960 --> 43:35.999
How long has Miss Gonzalez
been pregnant?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.312
I never said that.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.198
Was type of Code 46 violation
was it?

43:43.280 --> 43:46.033
I never mentioned Code 46.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.275
Where is the Mai Lin clinic?

43:50.840 --> 43:55.392
There's a confidentiality issue there,
I'm afraid, sir.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.357
Thank you for your help.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.392
<i>You rented a car.</i>

44:09.640 --> 44:13.828
<i>The clinic was afuera,
170km from the city.</i>

44:21.840 --> 44:24.879
<i>I imagined you like
a medieval knight on a quest.</i>

44:24.880 --> 44:26.791
<i>The quest for me.</i>

44:45.920 --> 44:47.990
I'm here to see Maria Gonzalez.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.356
No visitors are permitted until 6.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.599
I'm from Westerfields.
She's a witness in a major fraud case.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.875
- Name?
- Maria Gonzalez.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.879
- Your name.
- William Geld from Westerfields.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.159
- I need your print here.
- It's a very urgent situation.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.435
I know, name and print...

45:07.680 --> 45:09.671
I can tell by looking at you...

45:10.520 --> 45:14.479
that you are not
just a keypad presser,

45:14.920 --> 45:16.319
you make judgements.

45:16.560 --> 45:21.238
And I made my judgement about you.
If you don't have authorisation...

45:21.720 --> 45:25.715
Tell me one thing about yourself,
anything at all.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.838
I'm tired. I have conversations
like this one a lot.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.519
If I were able to guess your palabra,
would you be impressed?

45:36.520 --> 45:38.112
I would be mummified.

45:38.360 --> 45:42.036
- It's Garamond.
- It's nothing like that.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.759
Did you have an empathy virus?
It doesn't work here.

45:45.760 --> 45:48.320
That's why you got a cold here.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.996
We use antiviral bacteria,
we're infested with streptococci.

45:55.760 --> 46:00.879
Here on the outside we do not have
access to some of the pleasures

46:00.880 --> 46:03.519
freely available on the inside.

46:07.640 --> 46:10.359
I have these...

46:14.040 --> 46:16.270
The gold ones are particularly good.

46:16.520 --> 46:21.152
I don't need wealth,
I just need a little encouragement.

46:23.400 --> 46:27.439
You have a very sophisticated
security system here.

46:27.440 --> 46:30.593
Of course, we have all kinds
of cases here.

46:30.600 --> 46:36.279
- What is Maria Gonzalez here for?
- Are you investigating her case?

46:36.400 --> 46:40.395
I'm investigating a fraud case,
she's a witness.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.875
She's had a finger graft.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.876
This is Maria Gonzalez.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.477
Take a seat.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.554
- You okay?
- I'm good.

46:59.800 --> 47:03.272
If this is about my finger,
then I don't want to prosecute.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.759
This is not about your finger.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.475
I need to speak to
Miss Gonzalez alone.

47:12.720 --> 47:15.075
You have no authorization.

47:23.960 --> 47:27.039
I'm investigating an incident
at your place of work.

47:27.040 --> 47:31.194
Fraudulent papeles were issued
from your printer.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.831
In the last fourteen days,
three people have died,

47:37.920 --> 47:43.838
while travelling with papeles issued
from your printer.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.513
The people who come to us
are all doing something dangerous.

47:49.560 --> 47:53.748
We have to expect that. Unfortunately
some of them won't make it.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.959
One of them, Damian Alekan,
bled to death.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.758
He was fond of bats, remember?

48:05.080 --> 48:07.150
You met him at a bar

48:07.400 --> 48:10.079
and you sold him a papel
which allowed him to go to Delhi.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.548
- When did he die?
- One week ago.

48:12.840 --> 48:14.432
I've been in here for ten days.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.753
The papeles were issued prior
to you arriving here.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.269
I'm tired, I would like to rest.

48:26.320 --> 48:29.551
Miss Gonzalez is still
in recovery.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.038
Why is she in here?

48:42.440 --> 48:46.199
- Please, don't use the word finger...
- Her finger has just been...

48:46.200 --> 48:50.879
It was damaged and re-grown on
her family's insurance 22 years ago.

48:50.880 --> 48:55.199
I know a lot about Miss Gonzalez,
she was pregnant when she came.

48:55.200 --> 49:00.310
I also know that you have no interest
in impeding my investigation.

49:01.840 --> 49:04.035
She violated code 46.

49:05.320 --> 49:09.872
We aborted the pregnancy and took out
the memory cluster around it.

49:10.560 --> 49:13.759
- The baby was terminated?
- There was no baby.

49:13.760 --> 49:16.310
Just a pregnancy that was terminated
and the memory removed.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.477
You've interfered

49:24.480 --> 49:27.759
with the memory of a key witness
in an insurance fraud.

49:27.760 --> 49:32.759
Her memory was very local. It's just
the man, sex act and pregnancy.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.512
She doesn't remember the man at all?

49:34.760 --> 49:37.759
The man, the sex, the
pregnancy, we've erased all of them.

49:37.760 --> 49:42.079
It's the same Maria Gonzalez.
The finger was a placebo memory.

49:42.080 --> 49:46.871
I moved it from her childhood.
I think it's very effective.

49:47.960 --> 49:52.399
- When will she be able to leave?
- She's due to leave tomorrow.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.429
I'm afraid I may have to ask you
to release her to me now.

49:58.720 --> 50:02.559
<i>Can you miss someone
you don't remember?</i>

50:02.560 --> 50:06.879
<i>Can one moment or experience
ever disappear completely?</i>

50:06.880 --> 50:11.114
<i>Or does it always exist somewhere,
waiting to be discovered?</i>

50:12.000 --> 50:16.599
Wait, I've forgotten something.
My suitcase, it's very important.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.431
It's in the back!

50:29.880 --> 50:31.711
Is that what you're going to do?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.991
Put me outside with them?

50:36.960 --> 50:40.113
You've been outside before,
for ten years.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.359
You didn't come back inside
till you were fourteen.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.509
You really did your homework.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.959
You can't sing,
you like sugar fountains,

50:47.960 --> 50:51.238
you like to grow real plants
from seeds.

50:51.480 --> 50:54.079
I must have been
your favourite subject at school.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.798
You hate the desert.

50:59.160 --> 51:01.230
<i>I always hated the desert.</i>

51:02.400 --> 51:05.479
<i>Even at college studying
Road Runner cartoons,</i>

51:05.480 --> 51:08.074
<i>I had to look away.</i>

51:08.320 --> 51:13.239
I always wondered why the coyote
didn't buy a Road Runner.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.519
He had enough money to buy
rocket-powered skates,

51:15.520 --> 51:17.909
let alone a Road Runner.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.555
How did you do that?

51:22.640 --> 51:24.198
What?

51:24.440 --> 51:28.879
I was thinking something
and you heard me. That is weird.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.118
Intuition,

51:31.360 --> 51:34.591
I can feel what you're thinking.

51:35.240 --> 51:38.719
I don't believe in mind-reading,
I think it is all a trick.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.278
It's not a trick, it's a gift.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.275
What am I thinking now?

51:49.520 --> 51:52.080
Damian Alekan.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.833
- Have you been here before?
- Once.

52:10.960 --> 52:14.077
- You like it?
- I was only here a day.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.434
But, yes. I like it very much.

52:49.680 --> 52:51.432
Excuse the mess.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.438
Come here.

53:14.160 --> 53:15.354
Sit down.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.998
That's Damian,

53:34.440 --> 53:36.192
you recognize him now?

53:43.160 --> 53:45.469
I remember he wanted to go to Delhi.

53:46.280 --> 53:50.195
And I remember the look on his face
when I gave him the papel.

53:50.960 --> 53:55.831
He tried for years
to get one officially and couldn't.

54:08.280 --> 54:11.272
I was there when you met Damian.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.431
I was with you at the bar.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.958
I don't understand.

54:17.200 --> 54:21.036
You don't remember because
they erased your memory.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.191
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.431
I came to Shanghai
to investigate a fraud.

54:30.440 --> 54:32.237
I knew you were guilty,

54:34.560 --> 54:36.676
but then I fell in love with you.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.636
Why would they erase
my memory of you?

54:50.080 --> 54:51.672
I don't know.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.435
Where's my cosa?

55:12.120 --> 55:15.599
- I can't find my cosa.
- You haven't lost anything.

55:15.600 --> 55:19.390
- You haven't lost anything, relax.
- I can't find my...

55:19.880 --> 55:21.438
I can't find my cosa!

55:26.000 --> 55:27.877
Will you stay with me?

55:34.000 --> 55:37.870
- I'm so tired.
- I'll stay with you till you wake up.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.553
- What is it?
- It'll help you sleep.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.554
- I don't understand anything.
- Neither do I.

55:55.720 --> 56:00.199
<i>My father used to tell me stories
as I fell asleep.</i>

56:00.200 --> 56:03.160
<i>Stories about Jebel Ali
and the Arabian Sea.</i>

56:05.720 --> 56:08.109
<i>Stories of magic and adventure.</i>

56:09.320 --> 56:13.079
<i>He used to live there
and believed that if we returned</i>

56:13.080 --> 56:18.519
<i>everything would be alright,
everything would be like it used to,</i>

56:18.520 --> 56:20.272
<i>before we were exiled.</i>

56:24.800 --> 56:26.870
<i>And in my dreams, I was there.</i>

56:38.960 --> 56:40.871
Sample, please.

56:41.680 --> 56:42.749
Thanks.

56:47.080 --> 56:50.919
I've screened 30 sets of genes
and there are no code 46 issues.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.956
It's perfectly safe for you to marry.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.428
I'd recommend it.

56:55.360 --> 56:58.832
You both have the code
for high intelligence.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.672
- Thanks very much.
- Bye, bye.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.158
Do you know this woman?

57:05.840 --> 57:07.637
I'm looking for her.

57:08.080 --> 57:11.040
You must have found her
if you have her hair.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.549
It was given to me
by relatives.

57:15.600 --> 57:19.754
- Your relationship to this woman?
- I just want to know about her.

57:20.440 --> 57:23.477
You can't liase with her.
Look at this.

57:23.720 --> 57:29.119
This is her DNA, 50% match
the hair samples.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.553
Here...

57:31.560 --> 57:33.198
is the DNA of your mother,

57:33.440 --> 57:36.591
a 100% match,
genetically identical.

57:36.840 --> 57:41.756
Any liaison with this woman
would be a code 46 violation.

57:42.120 --> 57:45.273
- How can that be?
- Anything's possible with vitriol.

57:45.280 --> 57:48.439
Your mother was one of a batch
of 24 cloned foetuses.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.999
The hair is from your mother
or one of her genetic twins.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.037
She's identical to my mother?

57:59.200 --> 58:02.715
Diet, climate, environment,

58:02.960 --> 58:06.270
chance, surgery, the stars, God.

58:07.160 --> 58:09.913
We aren't prisoners of our genes.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.831
Is this hair from your mother?

58:16.560 --> 58:20.032
- Are you in love with this woman?
- Why?

58:21.280 --> 58:23.111
Is she pregnant?

58:24.440 --> 58:28.071
- Were you naturally conceived?
- In vitriol.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.879
Your nurture parents
will have your records.

58:31.880 --> 58:34.758
- They're dead.
- I'm sorry.

58:37.640 --> 58:38.834
Thanks.

59:04.800 --> 59:08.590
<i>If we're frightened we run,
it's our instinct.</i>

59:08.880 --> 59:13.039
<i>Adrenaline pumps round the body,
the muscles contract,</i>

59:13.040 --> 59:15.838
<i>our heart beasts faster
and we run.</i>

59:17.160 --> 59:18.639
<i>We run for our lives,</i>

59:18.880 --> 59:22.716
<i>we run for safety,
for our home, our families,</i>

59:23.160 --> 59:24.718
<i>our loved ones.</i>

59:28.360 --> 59:31.113
<i>I don't want you to drive and call.</i>

59:31.360 --> 59:33.799
I'm going to the airport
and I'll be home tomorrow.

59:33.800 --> 59:36.589
<i>- Did you catch the bad guy?
- Every time.</i>

59:43.640 --> 59:47.189
<i>- How are you?
- I love you.</i>

59:47.880 --> 59:50.075
<i>- Me, too.
- See you soon.</i>

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.800
I need a ticket to Seattle.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.239
It's completely red,
it's out of date.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.957
You're not covered for the Asia area.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.599
But I don't want to be here,
I want to go home.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.039
- I'm covered to go home, right?
- I really don't know, sir.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.473
Yes, I'm covered for home.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.479
But you're not at home, sir.
You're in Shanghai without cover.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.279
Why don't you just kick me out
in the general direction of home?

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.239
You can't fly or be in the Asia area
without cover.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.199
What am I going to do?
Piss out the window at 20,000 feet?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.068
I don't know your character
well enough to say so, sir.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.638
Maybe I can guess something
about your character.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.352
These are particularly fun.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.519
I'm afraid you guessed wrong, sir.
I'm a Christian scientist.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.755
- I don't do drugs or coffee.
- Damn, I'm all out of bibles!

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.034
<i>- Can I come in?
- Can I stop you?</i>

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.633
- I need your help.
- How have you been?

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.031
I had something to do.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.118
I shouldn't be in Shanghai,
I should be in Seattle.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.639
- You knew that last night.
- I have to go.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.154
- Go!
- I can't.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.797
My papel is red, I can't get out.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.636
So you tried already,
you were just going to disappear.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.313
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry!

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.518
You say that too much.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.149
I need to go home.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.998
You have a family?

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.390
- Boy or girl?
- Boy.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.468
Jim.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.799
He must think you're a hero
for catching bad guys like me.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.438
Something like that.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.434
You know what they say,
"the Sphinx knows best".

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.794
Maybe there's a reason
you can't go home.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.318
It's fake,

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.639
I have to swap it for a genuine pass.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.279
I'll meet you at the airport at seven,
okay?

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.317
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.839
My name's Maria Gonzalez,
I have an access problem.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.719
I have a new finger
and it needs to be recoded.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.314
- Hold on a moment please.
- Thanks.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.999
- Good morning.
- It's so good to see you.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.437
I have a new finger
and I need it to be recoded.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.436
I know, you've been relocated.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.353
- Sorry?
- You've been relocated.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.598
Why don't you come inside?

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.039
<i>- William, where are you?
- I'm in Shanghai.</i>

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.239
<i>- Isn't your cover out?
- I extended it.</i>

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.800
<i>No, you haven't. Where is Maria?</i>

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.319
<i>Why did you remove her from Mai Lin
clinic without authorization?</i>

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.151
<i>- She was a suspect?
- Was?</i>

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.874
Is.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.319
<i>You seem upset, William.
Report to the Shanghai office today,</i>

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.197
<i>they will take over the case.</i>

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.870
Bring me what you can, today.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.834
EXIT ONLY

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.595
It's a single exit cover,

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.671
valid for today only.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.231
The Seattle flights
leave from zone C.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.517
I do remember you.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.757
From a dream,

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.277
from my birthday.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.917
You should go home.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:26.839
Two for Jebel Ali.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.991
- Which flight, sir?
- The next one.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.676
- Do you have cover?
- I'm a resident here.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.193
Sorry, I forgot. It's my new finger.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.312
Thanks for choosing Pan Worldwide
Airways, have a safe journey.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.118
<i>I'd always dreamt ofJebel Ali,
Jebel Ali of my father's stories.</i>

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:56.749
<i>He said you could do anything there,
as long as you wanted it enough.</i>

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.198
You know something?

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.591
You know what? Every time I imagined
doing this, I imagined being with you,

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.676
even though we've never met.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.118
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.388
We're looking for a place to stay.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.637
Come.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.875
<i>You've never been outside,
I could be your guide.</i>

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.039
<i>Your teacher.</i>

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.032
<i>Three pacoras.</i>

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.119
We're looking for a room,
we have cover.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.519
No one has cover for over here.
You can't buy cover for here.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.351
Residents sleep at their own risk.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.879
- Can we have a room?
- Room, food, a game of chess.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.519
There's a shower through there,

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.796
you're covered in dust!

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.713
- It'll be noisy, I'm afraid.
- That doesn't matter.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.039
We'll sleep through anything,
we're so tired.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.951
- You've come a long way?
- Yes.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.839
My wife made that

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.877
before she passed on.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.796
- Think about her before sleeping.
- Thanks.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.992
It's a pleasure to have you.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.958
Will you put this on?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.394
- Does your wife look like you?
- No.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.797
How did you meet?

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.434
We worked together till
we had Jim.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.072
- You must miss him.
- Yes.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.559
Sing.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.679
What?

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.112
I want to hear you sing.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.432
I can't sing.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.119
Sorry.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.272
It's okay.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.272
It's not your fault.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.034
It's viral.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.559
The Sphinx gave you a virus.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.233
Like what? An anti-William virus?

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.799
It's involuntary, it's like adrenalin.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.959
When you're scared of something,
your body gets ready to run away.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.758
- I'm not scared of you.
- I know but your body is.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.429
I want you to make love to me.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.317
Make me make love to you.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.952
I love you...

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.072
<i>You knew how the virus works.</i>

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.831
<i>Was there nothing you could do
to stop me?</i>

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.079
- I have to make a call.
- It will be recorded.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.071
- That's okay.
- The phone's there.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.992
My name is Maria Gonzalez.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.834
I'm recording a code 46 violation.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.798
<i>What is your location?</i>

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.552
- What is this address?
- 168, Shada Perrera.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.631
<i>- Please wait there.
- I'll be right here.</i>

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.959
Wake up.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.551
Come on, wake up,

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.154
we have to go.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.789
No, I want to stay here forever.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.190
See? I can kiss you now.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.996
I have to go, come on.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.872
Something's happened.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:38.715
- We need a car, can you help?
- Cars cost more than in the city.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.797
I got these.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.953
I need money,
people have to eat.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.476
It's all I've got.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.994
It's not enough.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.751
Sonno, take them to the shop
and tell Farrukh to give them a mini.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.190
Stop playing now, stop it!

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.874
<i>You went before a tribunal.</i>

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.199
<i>They decided the empathy virus
had affected your judgement,</i>

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.794
<i>so they took away your memory of me.</i>

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.476
<i>Just like they had wiped
my memory of you.</i>

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.269
What does he remember
about the crash?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.559
He knows he went to Shanghai,
he solved a case

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.839
on the way to the airport
he crashed the hire car.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.232
As far as he's concerned,
he never went to Jebel Ali.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.038
I'll leave you alone.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.679
Thank you.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.437
I missed you.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.474
It's good to see you.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.271
I brought you some clothes.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.313
Daddy!

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.199
Where have you been?

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.674
I did a silly thing,
I crashed a car,

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.673
but the doctors fixed me up real good.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.079
What am I thinking?

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.075
I don't know.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.631
I'm thinking about boats.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.797
<i>I was exiled
because I tried to cheat the Sphinx.</i>

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.396
<i>They left me my memories.</i>

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.996
<i>They don't care what you think
if you're outside.</i>

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.355
<i>Why bother?
To them, it's as if we don't exist.</i>

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.598
That feels good!
