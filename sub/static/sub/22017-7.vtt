00:00.053 --> 00:01.544
Previously on Star...

00:01.555 --> 00:03.385
- You got me out of juvie?
- Yes.

00:03.396 --> 00:05.041
I want to know Star
won't get hurt by this.

00:05.065 --> 00:06.497
Just get the pictures

00:06.533 --> 00:08.032
<i>off her damn phone.</i>

00:08.068 --> 00:10.435
My daughter here found this.
Is that yours?

00:10.446 --> 00:12.837
Yes Your daughter was raised right.
Joyce Sheree.

00:12.872 --> 00:14.150
You're the biggest thing
in Atlanta right now.

00:14.174 --> 00:15.707
This the demo Alex
helped me with.

00:15.742 --> 00:17.642
Some baby-making
music right there.

00:17.677 --> 00:20.445
A track with Roland Crane's
daughter and Noah Brooks?

00:20.480 --> 00:21.891
<i>You know how many
clicks that would get?</i>

00:21.915 --> 00:23.147
You make Black Twitter happy,

00:23.183 --> 00:24.449
you make Ayanna happy.

00:24.484 --> 00:26.217
It's all hype and perception.

00:26.252 --> 00:28.186
I thought it was all
music and talent.

00:30.457 --> 00:31.990
I told you we were done.

00:32.025 --> 00:33.869
You ain't never gonna be
able to leave me, girl.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.393
Officer, stop!

00:35.428 --> 00:37.195
<i>Lucky was my brother.</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:43.770
Um, I feel like what
happened that night is...

00:44.238 --> 00:46.637
on repeat in America.

00:47.339 --> 00:50.475
Every week, every month.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.511
It's...

00:53.546 --> 00:55.880
weirdly normal.

00:55.915 --> 00:58.082
How am I supposed
to feel about it?

01:02.960 --> 01:05.223
These things happen
all the time.

01:06.004 --> 01:09.093
Yeah, what do you
want me to say?

01:09.129 --> 01:11.095
Just talk about him.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.843
Who is Lucky Keyes?

01:18.338 --> 01:20.071
America, wake up.

01:20.106 --> 01:22.173
Noah Brooks' friend,
Lucas Keyes,

01:22.208 --> 01:24.409
was shot point-blank

01:24.444 --> 01:26.022
- for reaching for his wallet.
- Hey, it's playing right now.

01:26.046 --> 01:27.945
How many cases

01:27.981 --> 01:29.914
do you have to hear?

01:29.949 --> 01:32.183
How many times are
you going to tell us

01:32.218 --> 01:35.053
it was misunderstood?

01:35.088 --> 01:37.388
It was based on fear?

01:37.424 --> 01:39.957
Colin Kaepernick took a knee

01:39.993 --> 01:41.559
protesting hatred.

01:41.594 --> 01:44.562
It brings to mind the sit-ins

01:44.597 --> 01:46.664
in the Civil Rights Movement

01:46.699 --> 01:49.000
of the 1960s.

Sorry I'm late,

03:56.596 --> 03:57.828
but not really.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.897
We're trying to work
out this new song,

03:59.933 --> 04:02.166
and I think I'm onto something.

04:02.202 --> 04:03.367
You gassed up, aren't you?

04:03.403 --> 04:05.203
Yeah, maybe,

04:05.238 --> 04:07.271
'cause a bomb-ass artist
wants to be featured

04:07.307 --> 04:08.372
on our new track.

04:08.408 --> 04:09.540
Yeah? Who?

04:09.576 --> 04:11.322
I'm not telling the competition.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.805
Brooks. Can we get a smile?

04:14.114 --> 04:16.680
We're uploading pictures of you
guys onto the Midtown site,

04:16.716 --> 04:18.694
so I'm gonna need you to look at
her like you've seen her naked.

04:18.718 --> 04:19.827
You ain't learned
your lesson from Star

04:19.851 --> 04:21.017
choking your ass out, huh?

04:21.053 --> 04:23.221
Excuse you. I'm pretty
sure you started this.

04:23.256 --> 04:26.292
I mean, this was
your idea, right?

04:26.303 --> 04:29.126
Noah... she's not even worth it.

04:29.162 --> 04:31.295
Can you give us a minute?

04:36.431 --> 04:38.002
Look, ordinarily,

04:38.037 --> 04:40.004
I would not be
thinking like this.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.206
But maybe GiGi was right

04:42.242 --> 04:43.652
about the whole
self-promotion thing.

04:43.676 --> 04:45.710
We've been getting a lot
of love on the Internet.

04:45.745 --> 04:47.445
People like us together.

04:50.256 --> 04:54.919
Remember when you said that I
could talk to you about anything?

04:54.954 --> 04:57.688
Well, it goes both ways, Noah.

05:02.629 --> 05:05.263
And I'm not trying
to get with you.

05:05.298 --> 05:06.597
Remember that.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.332
Thanks, Crane.

05:08.368 --> 05:09.867
Thank you.

05:09.902 --> 05:12.503
I'm good. I'm good.

05:14.107 --> 05:17.808
Rachel... let's do this.

05:21.102 --> 05:23.147
Okay. Let's be cute.

05:23.182 --> 05:24.882
Inspire me.

05:24.917 --> 05:30.244
Come on, you guys just started dating.
You're in love. Little closer, come on.

05:30.650 --> 05:32.477
Little kiss wouldn't hurt.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.259
It's cute.

05:35.295 --> 05:37.628
It's adorable, actually.

05:37.664 --> 05:41.265
But sexy would be great, too.

05:41.301 --> 05:42.933
Hey, Star.

05:44.051 --> 05:45.469
Hey.

05:45.505 --> 05:47.004
What's up?

05:48.898 --> 05:50.551
How was your fake date?

05:50.664 --> 05:51.876
I thought you didn't care.

05:51.911 --> 05:53.144
Come here.

05:53.179 --> 05:55.446
- Come here, come here.
- Don't grab me.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.814
If you mad, say you mad.

05:56.849 --> 05:58.215
The only thing that I care about

05:58.251 --> 05:59.762
is that my girl's
wasting time with you

05:59.786 --> 06:01.652
when we got work to do.

06:03.303 --> 06:06.557
Don't worry about it. I got
somewhere to be, anyway.

06:13.232 --> 06:15.566
Give me a latte. Skinny.
Easy foam.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.479
- And whatever she wants.
- Right away, Ms. Floyd.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.148
Can I have a hot apple cider?

06:23.009 --> 06:24.809
Miss Carlotta's not gonna like

06:24.844 --> 06:26.377
that you have custody over me.

06:26.412 --> 06:28.913
I don't care what Carlotta thinks.
It's temporary.

06:28.948 --> 06:31.449
Yeah, I don't think we
should tell her yet.

06:31.484 --> 06:32.583
That's your choice.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.289
Hi, Dad.

06:38.324 --> 06:41.525
Yes, I've seen
quarterly reports.

06:41.561 --> 06:43.561
I thought I had a year.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.477
Then I'll just have to show
you how important Midtown is

06:48.501 --> 06:51.001
before the end of the quarter.

07:27.273 --> 07:29.628
What? With who?

07:29.639 --> 07:31.220

07:36.444 --> 07:37.982
Not hooking.

07:43.623 --> 07:44.867
I'm about to put
her ass in check,

Yeah, well, I want it now.

10:29.742 --> 10:32.087
Listen, Ayanna, I get it.
I understand.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.665
It was a tough quarter.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.434
But you can't just move
the showcase date up.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.803
We made the deal with
the streaming services.

10:38.838 --> 10:42.840
And Angel and I aren't
exactly ready yet.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.042
Get ready.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.510
This showcase has to launch

10:45.545 --> 10:48.112
a breakout star who will
keep our doors open.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.582
Make it happen or you
won't have a job.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.685
And neither will I.

10:56.017 --> 10:58.197
You wanted to see me?

10:59.820 --> 11:02.694
Your girls are going
to be in the showcase.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.140
They've got two
weeks to get ready.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.798
I thought it was a month away.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.943
I mean, we'll be ready.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.902
I knew you'd come around.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.737
Took your damn time, but still.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.406
I do have one concern,
though, with Simone.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.392
- What about her?
- Can she handle the pressure?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.813
Like I told you,

11:21.848 --> 11:25.650
you worry about your label,
I'll worry about Simone.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.624
No, I like it. I like
it with the dress.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.058
Deyvar, you like this lip?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.260
It's too dark.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.661
No, it's not.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.162
Shut your ass.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.566
Yerp.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.402
- What's popping?
- Hey, Joyce.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.837
How's it going? This is Star.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.583
The white girl from the
party the other night.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.774
What's up, white girl?

11:49.809 --> 11:52.054
I was wondering what time you'd be
able to roll to the studio tonight.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.711
It's been crazy.
I've been in, like,

11:53.747 --> 11:55.258
three different countries
in three days.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.949
- This life is no joke.
- We love you,

11:57.984 --> 11:59.751
- Joyce Sheree, I love you.
- Oh, my God.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.152
- Hey, who's that?
- I'm sorry.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.654
That's my little sister Simone.

12:02.689 --> 12:03.889
You're gonna meet her tonight.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.736
All right, bae,
I'll see you soon.

12:05.747 --> 12:08.159
- She's in.
- Well, we need more studio time.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.494
You're gonna need
more than that,

12:09.529 --> 12:11.796
because you are in the showcase.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.932
- What?
- Yeah.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.768
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.637
But the only thing is this:
Ayanna pushed the date up.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.239
She wants to do
this big PR thing.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.408
- And we just gotta be hot.
- We can do that.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.977
We got heat. We
got Joyce Sheree.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.679
- You did?
- Yeah.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.814
That's what I'm talking about.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.927
See, you know what, you know what?
Sit down for a minute.

12:31.951 --> 12:35.386
Take a minute and think
about how far y'all come.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.522
God is good.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.029
We did it.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.431
Yeah, we did it!

12:46.466 --> 12:47.943
Finally, we can stop
with all the stunts,

12:47.967 --> 12:49.801
trying to get
Ayanna's attention.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.114
You don't gotta do that fake
relationship with Noah anymore.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.073
Why? Have you not been seeing
all the Take Three fans

12:55.108 --> 12:57.175
we've been gaining since
I've been doing this?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.609
Yeah, I just thought
you'd be happy

12:58.645 --> 13:00.545
to focus your attention
back on the music.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.680
I can manage both
music and the PR.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.553
- It's called being an artist.
- Okay.

13:05.564 --> 13:07.690
You're just mad 'cause you're
not the one with Noah.

13:07.701 --> 13:08.764
What are you talking about?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.713
You always want to be the
reason we're getting attention.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.074
I'm over it.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.426
Damn.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.464
- Come in.
- How you been?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.699
This Lucky shooting
got everybody spun.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.568
But I'm hangin'. What's up?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.678
The girls need studio time.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.067
I heard they're in the show.

13:28.078 --> 13:29.540
You come a long way
from that chick

13:29.576 --> 13:31.042
that busted in Ayanna's office.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.077
Nah, I'm still that chick.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.879
So, what they planning?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.447
You'll see.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.050
Oh. What time you looking at?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.252
Maybe in, uh... hold on.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.622
Hey, Elliot.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.090
Uh-huh.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.625
No, I haven't.

13:48.497 --> 13:50.128
No, you doing the right thing.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.764
Thanks for calling me.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.665
Everything okay?

13:54.701 --> 13:58.035
My daughter ain't been to work in a week.
I got to go.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.405
Just get the girls
studio time for today.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.906
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:07.691 --> 14:08.874
I'm here.

14:09.138 --> 14:10.603
Let's get money.

14:21.590 --> 14:24.695
- Get the side boob here.
- You want to give us a second?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.967
Star's phone was clean.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.069
There's no trace of
Hunter anywhere on it.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.671
Well, look harder.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.141
I want my money. Don't
make me hurt you, lady.

14:37.854 --> 14:39.644
Go ahead.

14:41.118 --> 14:43.080
I dare you.

14:43.962 --> 14:46.451
You've always been a
gambler, haven't you?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.892
And then when you had
nothing to bet with,

14:48.903 --> 14:51.155
you bet with other
people's money.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.225
So now you are in deep
with the loan sharks.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.162
And they'll kill you.

15:00.751 --> 15:02.467
So your little girl

15:02.502 --> 15:06.537
has something that belongs
to me and my son.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.874

We got work to do.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.942
Joyce is coming by
the studio tonight.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.712
Wait. Y'all got Joyce Sheree?
That's the homie.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.024
We're gonna talk
about her performing

17:29.048 --> 17:31.148
- at the showcase with us.
- Oh.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.250
We got a spot, by the way.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.119
Mmm. Me, too.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.954
But I ain't got no
stunt like Joyce.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.590
Aw. You used to be
the King of the A.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.058
- Mmm.
- Think of one.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.627
- Used to be. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.595
Yeah, well, I'm the king
of that ass, though.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.797
That's all that
matters right now.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.468
Uh-uh. All right, all
right, all right.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.436
You about to get me
started all over again.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.882
Oh, 'cause you're not in the
mood for me right now. Right.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.473
No. I'm not in the mood.
You right.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.274
- Got it.
- Yeah.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.710
Yeah.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.879
What you need to do
is stop drinking.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.317
Hey.

18:28.466 --> 18:30.922
I was hoping you'd do my head.

18:31.858 --> 18:33.357
What you want done to it?

18:33.393 --> 18:34.792
Well, as you can see,

18:34.827 --> 18:36.294
it's pretty thick.

18:36.329 --> 18:38.229
Just needs to be taken care of.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.799
Hmm.

18:41.834 --> 18:45.269
- I know who you is.
- Mm-hmm.

18:45.305 --> 18:46.737
I'm sure.

18:46.773 --> 18:49.140
And I heard you were
very good at your job.

18:49.175 --> 18:51.509
What's your name, anyway?

18:51.577 --> 18:53.577
You know who I am.

18:53.613 --> 18:55.613
And I know what went down
with you and them girls.

18:55.648 --> 18:57.682
You think Carlotta
ain't tell me?

18:59.018 --> 19:01.552
Honestly, I just
came for a haircut.

19:01.587 --> 19:03.454
I don't cut white boys' hair.

19:04.513 --> 19:06.324
Hey, Bruce.

19:06.392 --> 19:07.758
Hi.

19:07.794 --> 19:10.428
- Damn.
- I need another shot.

19:10.463 --> 19:12.163
My ass still ain't
sitting right.

19:12.198 --> 19:14.243
Bitch, are you crazy? You
cannot say that out loud here.

19:14.267 --> 19:15.844
Don't nobody know I be sitting
here, doing ass shots.

19:15.868 --> 19:17.068
You trying to get me fired?

19:17.136 --> 19:19.537
Could I use a
toilet before I go?

19:20.244 --> 19:22.173
It's around the corner.
Make it quick.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.542
Yes, ma'am.

19:24.577 --> 19:26.577
You cannot come here talking

19:26.612 --> 19:28.779
about no ass shots
at my job, girl.

19:28.815 --> 19:30.168
- I was gonna tell you.
- Yeah, no, you weren't.

19:30.179 --> 19:32.783
I really was. I just wanted to
make sure I actually liked him.

19:32.819 --> 19:34.697
Are you ready to jump into
something this quick?

19:34.721 --> 19:37.888
- Hunter's body ain't even cold yet.
- Shh. Come here, Simone.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.992
I actually like him.

19:42.528 --> 19:44.195
He's really cool.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.796
Got a bit of a drinking problem,

19:45.832 --> 19:47.776
- but we can fix that.
- Just like you could fix Hunter?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.511
It's like you haven't
learned your lesson yet.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.502
You can't fix people, Star.

19:51.537 --> 19:52.948
No matter how famous
they can get you.

19:52.972 --> 19:54.338
It's not about fame with him.

19:54.374 --> 19:56.874
That's why I don't even
want anybody knowing.

19:56.909 --> 19:58.476
So, is that why...

19:58.511 --> 20:01.345
- you don't want Alex and Noah together?
- Yeah.

20:01.381 --> 20:03.914
Yeah, you a real trip.
A trip to Bermuda.

20:05.585 --> 20:07.985
Hey.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.956
What?

20:12.493 --> 20:13.781
Um...

20:14.410 --> 20:17.578
We overheard Miss Carlotta telling
Bruce that you were shoplifting.

20:17.613 --> 20:20.814
Which is weird, 'cause
you got money, so...

20:20.850 --> 20:23.150
why would you need to do that?

20:23.185 --> 20:25.152
It was a rush.

20:26.455 --> 20:29.389
I can't explain it.

21:01.002 --> 21:02.289
Cotton!

21:04.182 --> 21:05.425
Cotton, get out here.

21:05.461 --> 21:08.428
- What's wrong?
- She ain't been at work in a week.

21:08.464 --> 21:10.063
Ain't picking up the phone.

21:10.099 --> 21:14.434
She's under all this financial debt
to get right with Elliot. And me.

21:14.470 --> 21:16.281
The last time she was under
this kind of pressure,

21:16.305 --> 21:17.537
she started using.

21:17.573 --> 21:18.783
I mean, look, she did
tell me this guy

21:18.807 --> 21:20.374
was about to get
out from prison.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.987
She was nervous about
that, she told me that.

21:22.011 --> 21:23.774
Well, what else she say?

21:24.065 --> 21:26.446
What was he in for?

21:27.950 --> 21:29.816
Stop eating my damn food.

21:29.852 --> 21:32.786
♪ I know I know
what I want and ♪

21:32.821 --> 21:35.222
♪ I know I'm turning

21:35.257 --> 21:36.924
♪ We gon' ignore ya alarm ♪

21:36.959 --> 21:39.927

21:39.962 --> 21:41.995
- ♪ I know I know what I want and ♪
- Yeah.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.031
♪ I know you're
turning me on, so ♪

21:44.066 --> 21:47.534
♪ We gon' ignore ya alarm and ♪

21:47.569 --> 21:49.670
♪ Do it again in the mornin'. ♪

21:49.705 --> 21:51.705
Yeah, that's the bridge.
We can try it.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.740
- It's simple.
- Oh, Joyce is here mad early.

21:53.776 --> 21:56.276
- Cool. Cool.
- She's here.

21:56.312 --> 21:57.945
You got cramps?

21:57.980 --> 22:00.113
I got a headache.

22:00.149 --> 22:01.682
Studio C?

22:01.717 --> 22:02.757
White girl from the party.

22:02.785 --> 22:04.117
Hey.

22:04.153 --> 22:05.485
Hey.

22:05.521 --> 22:07.098
- How you doing, Mama?
- Good. Good to see you.

22:07.122 --> 22:08.855
- Good to see you.
- I'm Alex.

22:08.891 --> 22:10.791
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

22:10.826 --> 22:13.727
- I'm Simone.
- I'm Joyce.

22:13.762 --> 22:15.862
Nice to meet you, shyness.

22:15.898 --> 22:18.298
Yeah, you, um,
Noah's new boo, huh?

22:19.535 --> 22:21.368
It's all good. Y'all
mad cute on the Gram.

22:21.403 --> 22:22.703
Thanks.

22:22.738 --> 22:24.338
- J, what's up?
- Hey!

22:24.373 --> 22:25.906
- What's up, Mama?
- What's poppin'?

22:25.941 --> 22:27.218
- Good to see you.
- Oh, you look good.

22:27.242 --> 22:28.420
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah.

22:28.444 --> 22:30.510
Speaking of looking
good, I met your girl.

22:30.546 --> 22:32.312
- She a ten.
- Yeah, she is.

22:32.348 --> 22:34.025
Way better than that last
ho you was dealing with.

22:34.049 --> 22:36.094
- Chill out, man, come on...
- You know, Noah like the ho types.

22:36.118 --> 22:37.751
- For real?
- Oh, for real?

22:37.786 --> 22:38.797
- Don't embarrass me.
- You did a good job.

22:38.821 --> 22:40.982
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Thank you.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.923
So, the track's all
ready for you.

22:42.958 --> 22:45.926
All you got to do is hop in the
booth and put down your verse.

22:45.961 --> 22:47.127
What, Noah ain't tell y'all?

22:47.162 --> 22:49.162
- Noah ain't tell us what?
- What?

22:49.198 --> 22:51.798
I'm-a hop on his joint.
I mean, I'm still open

22:51.834 --> 22:53.834
to hear y'all joint,
but this is my boy.

22:53.869 --> 22:56.114
I told him I'd be there for him.
Um, plus, he said it's for,

22:56.138 --> 22:58.105
- like, some, uh...
- Showcase.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.284
Yeah, some showcase.
Something like that.

22:59.308 --> 23:00.874
Oh, he said it was
for the showcase.

23:00.909 --> 23:03.410
Got it.

23:03.445 --> 23:05.479
I got to take this right away.
I'm-I'm sorry.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.826
- Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

23:07.850 --> 23:11.718
- Thank you, Joyce. Okay, see ya.
- All right. All right, bae.

23:11.729 --> 23:15.188
- You serious right now? Really?
- I just gave her the option, all right?

23:15.224 --> 23:16.787
She chose.

23:17.008 --> 23:19.526
It happens all the time.

23:19.561 --> 23:22.562
How did he even know she
was singing on our track?

23:22.598 --> 23:24.765
I didn't tell him.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.734
Back to the drawing board.

23:30.806 --> 23:32.906
Yo, you told him, didn't you?

23:32.941 --> 23:35.709
Man, I told you he was
gonna play your ass.

23:35.744 --> 23:39.194
That's what happens when you
try to get ahead in the game.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.930
What, you got a GPS on that car?

23:43.966 --> 23:48.101
Hey, that pony used to
be my kid before Cotton.

23:50.866 --> 23:53.807
- What y'all want?
- Hey, is that your ride outside?

23:53.842 --> 23:55.609
'Cause I was wondering if, uh,

23:55.644 --> 23:57.544
you could move it
up a little bit.

23:57.579 --> 23:58.821
Open the door.

23:58.832 --> 24:01.099
- You got the wrong house.
- Who's at the door, baby?

24:01.110 --> 24:05.146
- Your mom and your daddy.
- Hey, get your ass back upstairs!

24:06.249 --> 24:09.150
If you gonna use
it, then use it.

24:09.185 --> 24:11.452
Shoot this...

24:11.487 --> 24:15.089
- Baby! Ma!
- I'm tired of rescuing you.

24:15.124 --> 24:17.658
Now, get your ass in the car
before I shoot you next!

24:17.694 --> 24:18.804
You stay away from my daughter.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.695
- Baby, I'm s...
- Why didn't you tell me

24:20.730 --> 24:22.595
your family was crazy?!

24:22.833 --> 24:25.199
You should call a doctor, baby.

24:29.899 --> 24:31.381
Okay, got it.

24:31.725 --> 24:33.307
Thanks.

24:36.459 --> 24:40.615
So, contacted one of my dad's
friends to get a name.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.883
And nothing.

24:42.919 --> 24:45.086
Can't we just rework the track?

24:46.196 --> 24:48.789
I would if I didn't build
that entire track around

24:48.825 --> 24:50.458
Joyce Sheree. I promise,

24:50.493 --> 24:52.226
you guys, I didn't
say anything to him.

24:52.262 --> 24:53.661
Oh, we know.

24:53.696 --> 24:55.363
Don't we know, Star?

24:55.398 --> 24:57.265
He's already got more
street cred than us.

24:57.300 --> 25:00.935
He's got his PR stunt with you, and
now he has a track with Joyce.

25:02.032 --> 25:03.249
That's everything
he needs to win.

25:03.273 --> 25:05.172
He's looking out for number one.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.008
Just like we always do.

25:07.043 --> 25:08.587
If we don't do the best
in this competition,

25:08.611 --> 25:09.844
we don't get the tour.

25:09.879 --> 25:12.346
And then that's it. We ass out.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.710
Where you going?

25:16.904 --> 25:18.619
I need some air.

25:30.256 --> 25:31.565
Hey, you.

25:35.171 --> 25:36.704
I didn't invite you in my car.

25:36.739 --> 25:38.406
Look what I found.

25:38.441 --> 25:41.235
You must've dropped it in my
car the night of the party.

25:41.246 --> 25:42.410
Huh.

25:44.570 --> 25:45.846
Thanks.

25:45.882 --> 25:49.317
Guess I can stop using
this janky old one.

25:49.352 --> 25:53.020
So, did y'all ever get Joyce
Sheree to sing on that track?

25:53.056 --> 25:54.655
Dude I was dealing
with stole her

25:54.691 --> 25:57.625
- and had her sing on his instead.
- Hmm.

25:57.660 --> 25:59.927
I guess I have you to thank

25:59.962 --> 26:02.163
for yet another terrible
choice in a man.

26:03.694 --> 26:06.592
I'm tired of apologizing
to you, Star.

26:06.603 --> 26:09.904
You want me out, I'm out.

26:09.939 --> 26:11.906
Yes, I do.

26:16.646 --> 26:20.435
- Say hello to the fans, boo.
- Ah, what's up?

26:20.446 --> 26:22.116
- Yeah, we go way back.
- Way back.

26:22.151 --> 26:23.851
Way back into time.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.720
All right, we gonna finish
this record, y'all.

26:25.755 --> 26:28.089
We gonna get back at y'all.
Peace!

26:29.320 --> 26:31.859
Yo, social media is a grind.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.394
- I know.
- For real. You got to,

26:33.429 --> 26:36.797
like, keep your followers
happy and keep your brand up.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.967
Look, I know you
just lost your boy.

26:40.002 --> 26:43.237
You're gonna always be looking
for ways to escape it.

26:45.076 --> 26:46.774
How you escape it?

26:47.555 --> 26:49.143
I got my vices.

26:54.842 --> 26:56.584
You gonna get me in trouble.

26:56.619 --> 26:58.052
- Aw, hell nah!
- What?

26:58.087 --> 26:59.986
Black Twitter's going
in on you right now.

26:59.997 --> 27:01.210
What?

27:01.221 --> 27:03.290
You cheating on Alex
with a white chick?

27:03.640 --> 27:04.794
Seriously?

27:04.805 --> 27:06.460
<i>You have a big
problem, Noah Brooks.</i>

27:06.496 --> 27:08.040
I already have white
people looking at you

27:08.064 --> 27:10.508
as some type of
police-inciting thug.

27:10.519 --> 27:13.953
And now you want your
black female audience

27:13.989 --> 27:15.689
to view you as a dog, too?

27:15.724 --> 27:17.957
We really talking about
social media right now?

27:17.993 --> 27:20.260
Sit your ass down.
The only thing

27:20.295 --> 27:23.163
keeping you in the media...
No, scratch that...

27:23.198 --> 27:26.166
On this label is this PR stunt.

27:26.201 --> 27:28.301
Now, you will clean this
up before the showcase,

27:28.336 --> 27:30.236
or don't bother coming at all.

27:34.209 --> 27:37.210
You really got me out here
looking dumb as hell.

27:38.071 --> 27:40.080
I wasn't trying to
do that to you.

27:40.115 --> 27:41.915
Did you try not to
steal Joyce, too?

27:43.852 --> 27:46.920
Just when I was starting
to like your sorry ass.

27:58.967 --> 28:01.034
You cannot just go
around shooting people.

28:01.069 --> 28:03.503
- What if he calls the police?
- He ain't calling no police!

28:03.538 --> 28:06.606
Coming straight out of prison!
Trust!

28:06.641 --> 28:08.186
You know, you've been
real disrespectful

28:08.210 --> 28:10.009
ever since you
came out of there.

28:10.045 --> 28:12.645
Yes, I lied to you about Jahil
being your father. Look at him.

28:12.681 --> 28:14.948
But we both thought it was
best you not be involved

28:14.983 --> 28:17.984
- in what he was caught up in.
- Look, it was my idea, Cotton.

28:18.019 --> 28:20.720
You better stay away from that man.
You on probation.

28:20.756 --> 28:22.667
You're gonna end up right back
in there if you're not careful,

28:22.691 --> 28:24.168
- you know that?
- He protected me. If not...

28:24.192 --> 28:25.369
So what? You think you
owe him something?

28:25.393 --> 28:26.593
I need him.

28:26.628 --> 28:28.561
You need him?!

28:28.597 --> 28:30.230
Let me tell you something.
You better

28:30.265 --> 28:32.899
stay away from his black ass.
You hear me?

28:32.934 --> 28:36.202
♪ We gon' ignore ya alarm
and do it again... ♪

28:36.238 --> 28:38.238
I like it. You guys like it?

28:38.273 --> 28:40.540
Joyce Sheree who, girl?

28:40.575 --> 28:43.376
- You killed this verse, Simone.
- Thank you, thank you.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.011
'Sup, girls?

28:45.022 --> 28:46.572
You know what,

28:47.013 --> 28:48.381
- I can't even right now.
- Yeah.

28:48.416 --> 28:50.817
I hate when boys think they're
cute when they're not.

28:50.852 --> 28:53.353
Don't you got
somewhere else to be?

28:53.388 --> 28:55.054
Somebody else's ideas to steal?

28:55.090 --> 28:57.740
That wasn't personal...
That was business.

28:58.444 --> 29:00.404
The chick who leaked the
video, on the other hand,

29:00.428 --> 29:02.695
she got personal, she got
messy, and she got desperate.

29:02.731 --> 29:05.465
I think using pillow talk
to get a leg up on us

29:05.500 --> 29:07.534
in the competition
is pretty personal.

29:07.569 --> 29:09.269
And messy. And desperate.

29:09.304 --> 29:12.005
Oh, my God.

29:13.102 --> 29:16.176
So y'all is really just gonna
argue about me, over me?

29:16.211 --> 29:18.111
Well, I got your argument.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.207
J.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.383
I'm so sorry. I don't really
want y'all arguing...

29:23.418 --> 29:25.418
Yo, you... Joyce?

29:25.453 --> 29:27.153
- I'm-I'm-I'm...
- Are you good?

29:27.189 --> 29:28.154
I'm good. I'm...

29:28.190 --> 29:30.290
- You sure?
- I'm-I'm sure.

29:30.325 --> 29:32.025
Okay.

29:32.961 --> 29:34.197
J.

29:36.198 --> 29:38.798
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

29:38.834 --> 29:41.100
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What's in that cup?

29:41.136 --> 29:43.503
- What's in that cup?
- It's lean.

29:43.538 --> 29:45.349
- That could kill her, man.
- She must've mixed it

29:45.373 --> 29:47.018
- with something. We got to call 911.
- Joyce.,

29:47.042 --> 29:49.053
- She mixed it with more lean.
- Joyce, wake up. Joyce, wake up!

29:49.077 --> 29:52.045
I can't lose somebody else.
Please, please, please wake up.

29:52.113 --> 29:54.180
Please, please.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.204
She's conscious.

30:04.609 --> 30:07.345
Hopefully, her manager
can talk her into rehab.

30:07.381 --> 30:08.913
Noah, thank you

30:08.949 --> 30:11.678
for staying with her until
the paramedics arrived.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.522
Oh, that-that was so scary.

30:17.557 --> 30:20.725
I mean, 'cause she's my idol.
Joyce.

30:20.761 --> 30:22.794
I wanted her dream,

30:22.829 --> 30:24.273
'cause she has it all,
and I thought that...

30:24.297 --> 30:26.431
What if I can't even
get my life together?

30:26.466 --> 30:29.534
Breathe. You're having
a panic attack.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.336
Is this why you took my pills?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.371
- I, uh...
- Where are they?

30:33.407 --> 30:35.173
Okay. I thought...

30:35.208 --> 30:37.242
I just thought that maybe
they would help me focus,

30:37.277 --> 30:39.778
- 'cause you take 'em...
- Because I know what I'm doing.

30:39.813 --> 30:42.013
I don't want what happened
to Joyce to happen to you.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.482
- Do you understand me?
- Okay. Yes. Yes, I do.

30:44.518 --> 30:46.418
Just a minute.

30:50.424 --> 30:53.058
Come here. Take this.

30:53.093 --> 30:54.526
- What is that?
- It's a Xanax.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.728
It will help bring you
down, help you to relax.

30:56.763 --> 30:59.731
No alcohol. You're still feeling
anxious after four hours,

30:59.766 --> 31:02.333
- I'll give you another one.
- Okay.

31:04.141 --> 31:05.403
You'll be fine.

31:09.230 --> 31:10.909
You good?

31:11.946 --> 31:14.412
Let's get back to work.

31:22.696 --> 31:24.889
You know this is
not your studio.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.325
- I didn't know y'all were still in here.
- Well, we are.

31:30.363 --> 31:32.263
Doesn't matter anyway.

31:32.299 --> 31:34.699
I can't give Midtown
what they want.

31:34.735 --> 31:36.657
Am I supposed to feel
sorry about that?

31:36.668 --> 31:40.054
Nah. I don't want nobody
feeling sorry for me.

31:40.474 --> 31:43.374
Lucky would've been told
me to stop whining by now.

31:44.544 --> 31:46.478
Lucky was counting on me.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.147
We used to hustle together.

31:49.182 --> 31:50.526
When he heard me
sing, he was like,

31:50.550 --> 31:52.250
"Bro, you ain't
slingin' no more."

31:53.390 --> 31:56.190
You ever have somebody
hear your music and...

31:56.628 --> 31:59.257
just believe in you like that?

32:00.616 --> 32:02.627
Yeah. Star.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.207
I miss him.

32:16.243 --> 32:18.543
I miss making my music.

32:18.578 --> 32:20.378
And those two things,

32:20.413 --> 32:22.847
they're all tied up together.

32:22.883 --> 32:25.450
I can't catch a break.

32:37.130 --> 32:39.097
What's up, guys?

32:39.132 --> 32:42.934
I'm sure you all have seen
the video of Noah's ex.

32:42.969 --> 32:45.303
She's trippin' because
she wants him back.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.372
And I'm here to tell you...

32:47.407 --> 32:49.874
And to let <i> her</i> know...

32:49.910 --> 32:52.043
That we're good.

32:52.979 --> 32:55.814
So stay out of our business.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.683
Okay?

33:03.855 --> 33:05.890
You just caught a break.

33:09.479 --> 33:11.563
Hey, it's me. I'm
just washing up.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.032
Joyce Sheree overdosed
in the studio.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.567
Yeah, I heard.

33:15.602 --> 33:16.935
Angel told me.

33:16.970 --> 33:18.636
It's crazy, right?

33:18.672 --> 33:21.206
Kind of makes you wonder
what kind of life

33:21.241 --> 33:23.241
we fighting for these
girls to get into.

33:23.276 --> 33:25.009
Guess what it is being
a manager, right?

33:25.078 --> 33:27.245
Yeah, a parent, too.

33:29.457 --> 33:32.917
Anyway, look, I'm, uh... I'm gonna be
moving out first thing in the morning.

33:32.953 --> 33:35.498
- I'm just working on the engine.
- Actually...

33:37.121 --> 33:39.157
I was thinking you
shouldn't leave.

33:41.161 --> 33:43.194
Not like that.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.297
But just to help keep
Cotton good, you know?

33:47.728 --> 33:49.300
Yeah, I can do that.

33:52.839 --> 33:54.739
Hey, Carlotta.

33:54.774 --> 33:56.875
- Figured I'd come check on you.
- Oh, hey.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.943
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Hey.

33:58.979 --> 34:00.378
Maurice, right?

34:00.413 --> 34:02.747
Jahil. You Andy and
Angel's guy, right?

34:02.782 --> 34:05.283
- Yeah.
- Am I... interrupting?

34:06.324 --> 34:09.152
No, I just... I
live in the back.

34:09.188 --> 34:11.688
Good night.

34:15.239 --> 34:16.828
How's your daughter doing?

34:16.862 --> 34:19.264
Oh, that's not an easy answer.

34:20.967 --> 34:24.135
I looked at her today, and
all I saw was the old me.

34:24.170 --> 34:25.536
Which was?

34:25.572 --> 34:28.672
A lost young woman
making bad choices.

34:28.708 --> 34:31.775
People got to make their own mistakes.
That's how we grow.

34:31.811 --> 34:34.545
No, she can't. She-she can't
make no more mistakes.

34:34.581 --> 34:36.947
If she does, she
goes back to prison.

34:37.603 --> 34:39.550
- Oh.
- And to make it a family affair,

34:39.585 --> 34:41.518
me and her daddy
both have records.

34:41.554 --> 34:43.621
Her dad?

34:46.226 --> 34:48.659
Jahil is, um...

34:49.795 --> 34:52.163
my daughter's father.

34:52.197 --> 34:54.431
Old boy?

34:54.467 --> 34:55.967
Some drama, huh?

34:56.002 --> 34:58.136
Wow.

34:58.171 --> 35:00.939
I know you're ready to go now.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.674

hear me talk a lot

36:31.940 --> 36:34.974
about how pressure

36:40.412 --> 36:44.450

So we are going to
open big and loud

36:49.057 --> 36:52.592
and strong with a
group opening number.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.828
Here is a copy of the track.

36:55.864 --> 36:58.164
- Noah Brooks.
- You each have a verse.

36:58.199 --> 37:00.099
You are going to close
the showcase...

37:00.135 --> 37:03.703
- Here you go.
- With Alex in a duet.

37:06.509 --> 37:09.642
That supposed to mean you're
performing with us and him?

37:09.677 --> 37:12.245
It does. They are
the biggest thing

37:12.280 --> 37:13.813
we have going here at Midtown,

37:13.848 --> 37:17.050
and they will help bring
eyes to all of you.

37:17.061 --> 37:20.453
Good luck, ladies and gentlemen.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.583
Congrats.

37:29.594 --> 37:31.180
All right.

37:38.937 --> 37:40.061
Alex.

37:41.239 --> 37:44.043
- Alex. Alex!
- What?

37:45.093 --> 37:47.405
Look, we cannot do this
showcase together.

37:47.416 --> 37:49.193
I feel like I'm taking something
away from my own group.

37:49.217 --> 37:53.320
Trust me, I'm not trying to get
in between you and your girls,

37:53.331 --> 37:55.555
but I think we got to
do what Ayanna wants.

37:55.590 --> 37:57.890
- Do we? Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

37:57.926 --> 38:00.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen.

38:02.297 --> 38:04.730

thank you for earlier.

For everything.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.860
Thank you.

38:13.399 --> 38:16.399
Is this your way of
convincing me to do the duet?

38:16.794 --> 38:19.132
'Cause if it is, you
really suck at this...

38:29.274 --> 38:32.825
I'm sorry. I shouldn't... I
shouldn't have done that.

38:35.854 --> 38:37.863
