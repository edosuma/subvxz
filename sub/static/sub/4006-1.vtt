15:49.250 --> 15:51.333
MIAMI HAS ONE LESS MURDERER
ON THE LOOSE.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.000
- THANK YOU.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.542
- THERE'S A LARGE
PRESS GATHERING OUTSIDE.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.208
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.125
- THERE'S STILL A LOT
TO BE DONE IN HERE.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.959
- SHE'S NOT AS COMFORTABLE
LYING TO THE WORLD AS I AM.

16:07.959 --> 16:09.333
- IT'S OKAY, LIEUTENANT.
YOU CAN GO.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.583
WE'RE JUST, UH,
WRAPPING THINGS UP.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.041
- GO TALK TO THEM.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.500
- COME ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.875
- I'LL SNEAK OUT BACK.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.792
IF THE PRESS SEES ME,
THEY'LL ONLY WANT TO TALK TO ME,

16:18.792 --> 16:21.291
AND YOU'RE THE HERO
THIS TIME.

16:21.291 --> 16:25.166
[overlapping chatter]

16:31.333 --> 16:33.208
- YEAH, BUT IT'S MORE HEROIC
IF YOU DON'T GET MAD.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.792
- LIEUTENANT--
[reporters shouting]

16:35.792 --> 16:38.166
- HEY--
- WHAT HAPPENED?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.875
- HEY, YOU.
COME HERE.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.375
WOULD YOU MAKE SURE
THIS GETS LOGGED?

17:10.375 --> 17:12.458
THANKS.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.083
- EVEN IF I PUT DEB
IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION

17:19.083 --> 17:20.458
OF LYING FOR ME,

17:20.458 --> 17:22.667
AT LEAST I'VE KEPT
THE BIGGER TRUTH FROM HER.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.500
IT'LL ALL BE OKAY.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.709
- OH, HEY, DEXTER.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:33.333 --> 17:35.792
- UH, JAMIE'S PUTTING
HARRISON TO BED.

17:35.792 --> 17:38.041
I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE HIM.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.208
- SO YOU USED MY COMPUTER
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

17:42.208 --> 17:44.166
- I JUST WANTED TO CHECK
THE BASKETBALL SCORES.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.375
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY.
- IT'S NOT OKAY.

17:46.375 --> 17:49.041
- WELL, I'M REALLY--
REALLY SORRY.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.250
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF YOU'RE SORRY, LOUIS.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.542
NEVER TOUCH MY THINGS.

17:53.542 --> 17:56.291
- LOUIS, HERE YOU ARE.

17:56.291 --> 17:59.125
- YEAH, HERE HE IS.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:59.125 --> 18:01.709
THIS IS DEXTER'S SIDE
OF THE APARTMENT.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.041
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WERE DIFFERENT SIDES.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.208
I'M, LIKE,
SUPER-SORRY.

18:07.959 --> 18:11.917
- IS HARRISON ASLEEP?
- YEAH. HE'S OUT.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.291
- YOU SHOULD GO HOME.
- OKAY.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.667
- SHIT.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.417
IT'LL ALL BE OKAY.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.583
- YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE ACTS LIKE

19:24.583 --> 19:26.375
DEXTER'S SUCH A GREAT GUY,

19:26.375 --> 19:29.709
BUT HE'S REALLY KIND OF
A POMPOUS JERK, DON'T YOU THINK?

19:29.709 --> 19:32.709
- UH, NO.

19:32.709 --> 19:34.834
- COME ON.

19:34.834 --> 19:37.041
HE'S ALL LIKE,
"DON'T TOUCH MY SHIT, MAN."

19:37.041 --> 19:38.709
WHAT A DICK.

19:38.709 --> 19:41.500
- LOUIS.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

19:41.500 --> 19:45.166
DEXTER'S MY BOSS, OKAY?

19:45.166 --> 19:47.000
AND HE HAPPENS TO BE
VERY GOOD TO ME.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.625
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

19:48.625 --> 19:50.792
WHY YOU WERE ON HIS SIDE
OF THE APARTMENT.

19:50.792 --> 19:52.834
- I TOLD YOU.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.000
I JUST WANTED TO GET
SOME WATER.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.375
- RIGHT.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.834
[both laugh]

19:56.834 --> 19:58.875
YOU KNOW,
THE MORE I GET TO KNOW YOU,

19:58.875 --> 20:01.792
THE WEIRDER AND WEIRDER
YOU GET.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.709
[turns on TV]

20:34.709 --> 20:37.750
- WE GO LIVE TO THIS
BREAKING NEWS 9 SPECIAL REPORT.

20:37.750 --> 20:41.208
- I CAN ONLY SPECULATE,
BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

20:41.208 --> 20:43.917
THAT TRAVIS MARSHALL
FELT THE INTENSE PRESSURE

20:43.917 --> 20:46.208
OF MIAMI METRO
ZEROING IN ON HIM,

20:46.208 --> 20:48.875
AND THAT LED TO HIS DECISION
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.458
- LIEUTENANT MORGAN,
ARE YOU RULING OUT

20:50.458 --> 20:52.667
THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THIS WAS A MURDER?

20:52.667 --> 20:55.542
[cell phone rings]

20:57.417 --> 21:00.417
- HEY, MIKE.
- JUST HAD A THOUGHT.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.208
WHERE WAS HIS CAR?

21:02.208 --> 21:04.917
- WHOSE CAR?
- TRAVIS MARSHALL'S.

21:04.917 --> 21:07.333
HIS CAR WASN'T FOUND
AT THE SCENE,

21:07.333 --> 21:10.000
SO HOW'D HE GET TO THE CHURCH?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.250
- I'M GUESSING THAT
A MAN THAT WAS ABOUT

21:12.250 --> 21:14.625
TO STAB HIMSELF
IN THE HEART WITH A SWORD

21:14.625 --> 21:19.083
PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE
A LONG WALK AS A BIG DEAL.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.667
- AH, PROBABLY RIGHT,

21:20.667 --> 21:22.875
BUT...STILL.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.959
- SURE. YEAH.
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

21:26.375 --> 21:28.250
- I WILL.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.709
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

21:30.709 --> 21:32.875
GOOD NIGHT, L.T.

21:47.625 --> 21:48.959
NEED SOME HELP?

21:48.959 --> 21:50.959
- NO. NO, THANK YOU.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.250
IT--IT'S OKAY.
I CAN FIX IT.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.125
- [laughs]
RELAX. I'M A COP.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.417
- WHERE'S YOUR LUG WRENCH AT?

21:59.417 --> 22:01.083
- NO--NO!

22:12.083 --> 22:14.083
[shouts in Russian]

22:39.250 --> 22:41.458
[tires squealing]

22:46.041 --> 22:48.875
[knock at door]

23:04.250 --> 23:08.583
- HOW WERE YOU SO PERFECTLY
PREPARED TO KILL TRAVIS?

23:08.583 --> 23:10.625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.542
- THE PLASTIC WRAP?
YOU JUST...

23:12.542 --> 23:15.709
HAPPENED TO HAVE THAT
WITH YOU?

23:15.709 --> 23:17.500
- I FOUND IT
IN THE STOREROOM.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.917
- WHAT ABOUT THE KNIVES?

23:18.917 --> 23:21.542
YOU SAID TRAVIS
CAME AT YOU WITH A SWORD.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.125
WHERE DID YOU GET THE KNIVES?

23:23.125 --> 23:25.000
THERE WAS, LIKE,
A WHOLE ROLL OF THEM.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.542
- TRAVIS HAD THEM WITH HIM.
THEY WERE HIS KNIVES.

23:27.542 --> 23:31.542
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
HE GOT THEM FROM.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.250
- YOU WEREN'T IN YOUR REGULAR
WORK CLOTHES.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.542
YOU CHANGED.
YOU HAD A...

23:37.542 --> 23:40.208
RUBBER APRON.

23:40.208 --> 23:43.625
PLASTIC SLEEVES.

23:45.917 --> 23:49.125
- [sighs]

23:49.125 --> 23:51.750
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER.

23:56.083 --> 24:00.542
- DEB, I'M SORRY
I PUT YOU IN THIS SITUATION.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.834
YOU LOOK PRETTY STRESSED.

24:07.834 --> 24:08.750
- YEAH.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.250
- BUT...

24:11.250 --> 24:13.041
YOU KNOW MY JOB
CAN GET MESSY.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.750
I ALWAYS KEEP A CHANGE
OF CLOTHES IN MY CAR.

24:15.750 --> 24:19.750
THE APRON, ALL THAT OTHER STUFF
IS JUST PART OF MY KIT.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.583
EVERY BLOOD SPATTER GUY'S
GOT 'EM.

24:25.959 --> 24:29.583
- WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU SAID,
"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING"?

24:29.583 --> 24:31.959
WHEN YOU TRIED
TO GET ME TO GO HOME,

24:31.959 --> 24:33.542
YOU SAID,
"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."

24:33.542 --> 24:34.875
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

24:34.875 --> 24:39.125
- I MEANT I WORK
CRIME SCENES EVERY DAY.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.291
[sighs] I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE
LIKE ME LOOK FOR,

24:41.291 --> 24:43.375
SO I KNOW WHAT TO COVER UP.

24:43.375 --> 24:46.667
- THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.750
- I KNOW IT DOESN'T.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.125
DEB, I NEVER MEANT
TO GET YOU INVOLVED

25:03.125 --> 25:06.166
IN ANY OF THIS.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.959
- BUT I AM.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.333
- WE GOTTA GO TO WORK.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.458
- [crying]

25:39.458 --> 25:41.834
- WHAT'S WRONG?

25:41.834 --> 25:43.834
- WE HAD TO GIVE BANJO BACK.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.875
- I AM SO SORRY, SWEETHEART.

25:45.875 --> 25:49.083
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN HIM
WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DAD.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.375
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

25:50.375 --> 25:53.166
- [tearfully]
I WANT BANJO BACK.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.917
- NO. IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

26:04.166 --> 26:06.166
DEB,

26:06.166 --> 26:08.750
LOOK, I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.
I ADMIT IT.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.625
BUT OTHER THAN SAYING
I'M SORRY AGAIN AND AGAIN,

26:11.625 --> 26:14.375
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
[cell phone rings]

26:17.375 --> 26:19.417
MORGAN.
WHAT?

26:19.417 --> 26:22.208
WHEN?

26:22.208 --> 26:23.959
JESUS FUCK!

26:23.959 --> 26:26.709
THAT WAS DISPATCH.
MIKE'S BEEN SHOT.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.417
- IS HE OKAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.834
- I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
- NOW, DEX!

26:30.834 --> 26:34.583
- DEB, I GOTTA...FIND MY KEYS,
PUT MY BAG TOGETHER.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.542
I'LL GET DISPATCH
TO TEXT ME THE ADDRESS.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.291
I'LL BE TWO MINUTES
BEHIND YOU.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.709
MY GETAWAY PACK.

26:58.208 --> 27:02.041
I DON'T WANT TO RUN.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.583
BUT IF DEB DOESN'T LET UP,

27:03.583 --> 27:06.041
THAT MAY BE MY ONLY OPTION.

27:17.291 --> 27:21.083
[police radio chatter]

27:29.875 --> 27:33.083
MIKE ANDERSON.
ONE OF OUR OWN.

27:34.709 --> 27:36.875
- WHOEVER DID THIS TO MIKE

27:36.875 --> 27:38.166
IS GONNA BE VERY SORRY.

27:38.166 --> 27:41.000
- HE'LL BE VERY FUCKIN'
DEAD.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.333
- HEY. WE DO EVERYTHING
BY THE BOOK.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.000
WE'RE COPS, NOT KILLERS.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.500
- BUT BEING A KILLER WOULD FEEL
SO VERY GOOD RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.709
- SHE SUFFERED BLUNT FORCE
TRAUMA TO THE HEAD...

27:55.709 --> 27:58.875
FROM SOMETHING...
NARROW AND CYLINDRICAL.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.417
- STEEL PIPE?
TIRE IRON?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.709
- YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28:02.709 --> 28:05.959
THE FIRST BLOW
WAS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HEAD,

28:05.959 --> 28:09.959
AND THEN THREE MORE BLOWS
TO THE TOP, MUCH HARDER.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.291
SHE--HER SKULL WAS FRACTURED

28:12.291 --> 28:14.166
AND SHE HEMORRHAGED,

28:14.166 --> 28:17.792
AS EVIDENCED BY THE BLOOD
THAT'S TRICKLING FROM HER EAR.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.208
WHEN WILL SHE BELIEVE ME?

28:23.208 --> 28:25.333
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SHE NEVER DOES?

28:25.333 --> 28:28.709
- WHEN DO YOU THINK
SHE BOUGHT IT?

28:28.709 --> 28:30.458
- RIGOR HAS SET IN.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.792
SHE HASN'T BEEN MOVED
FROM THIS TRUNK.

28:31.792 --> 28:34.041
AND JUDGING
FROM THE LIVIDITY

28:34.041 --> 28:36.500
AND POOLING ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF HER FACE AND TORSO,

28:36.500 --> 28:38.250
I'D SAY 8 TO 12 HOURS AGO.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.542
- NOT LONG AFTER
WE ALL LEFT THE CHURCH.

28:43.166 --> 28:44.709
- YEAH.

28:44.709 --> 28:46.583
- WHAT A FUCKED UP
COUPLE OF DAYS.

28:46.583 --> 28:49.834
- I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU
MORE, LIEUTENANT.

28:53.041 --> 28:55.208
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR ONE SHOOTER AT A MINIMUM.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.667
- THE SHOOTER HITS THIS GIRL,
DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK,

28:58.667 --> 29:00.625
SPEEDS OFF.
- GETS A FLAT TIRE.

29:00.625 --> 29:02.250
- HE REPAYS MIKE'S KINDNESS

29:02.250 --> 29:04.458
BY SHOOTING HIM
AND FLEEING IN MIKE'S CAR.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.583
- HIS CAR WAS FOUND
IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK

29:06.583 --> 29:08.542
NEAR NORTH WEST
FIFTY-SECOND.

29:08.542 --> 29:10.375
- I'VE GOT PEOPLE THERE.
WE'LL START CANVASSING.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.291
- AND HERE?
ANY WITNESSES?

29:12.291 --> 29:14.458
- NONE SO FAR.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.166
- MAYBE SOMEBODY
SAW SOMETHING.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.083
I'M ON MY WAY
TO TALK TO MIKE'S WIFE.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.834
ALL OF HER FAMILY'S
IN CHICAGO,

29:20.834 --> 29:22.750
AND SHE'S GONNA NEED
ALL OUR SUPPORT.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.083
- ANYTHING SHE NEEDS.

29:24.083 --> 29:26.625
- HOPEFULLY DEXTER AND I
WILL WIN THE DNA LOTTERY

29:26.625 --> 29:28.750
WITH OUR SWABS, 'CAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE HE WIPED THE CAR CLEAN.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.375
NOTHING ON PRINTS
EXCEPT FOR HERS.

29:31.375 --> 29:34.083
- WELL, JUDGING BY HER ATTIRE,
OR LACK OF IT,

29:34.083 --> 29:36.500
SHE WAS A STRIPPER.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.291
- AND ON DUTY
AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.166
- I'VE GOT AN I.D.
ON THE FINGERPRINTS.

29:41.166 --> 29:42.792
KAJA SOROKA.

29:42.792 --> 29:45.333
- SAME PERSON THIS CAR'S
REGISTERED TO.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.750
WE'LL FIND OUT
WHERE SHE WORKS.

29:47.750 --> 29:50.917
- STEERING WHEEL, SHIFTER,
DOOR HANDLES,

29:50.917 --> 29:53.333
SEATBELT BUCKLE--
THEY'RE ALL WIPED CLEAN.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.917
- BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ONE PLACE
THEY FORGET TO CLEAN--

29:55.917 --> 29:57.917
THE TURN SIGNAL.

30:25.125 --> 30:30.166
- [breathing hard]

30:31.625 --> 30:33.291
- YOU'RE CLEAR.
- OH, F-FUCK.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.834
- THE ROAD'S CLEAR.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.625
- [laughs]

30:36.625 --> 30:38.625
THANK YOU.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.166
[engine turns]

30:45.166 --> 30:47.834
FUCK!

31:16.667 --> 31:18.166
EXCUSE ME.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.583
I NEED TO SEE THE FILES
ON THE ICE TRUCK KILLER CASE.

31:20.583 --> 31:23.375
- ROW F-17.
- THANK YOU.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.125
HERE ON A WORK VISA.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.750
SHE WORKED AT THE FOX HOLE
GENTLEMAN'S CLUB IN PINECREST.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.750
NOW, THE SAME OWNER
IS LISTED AS HAVING

32:35.750 --> 32:37.750
FIVE OTHER STRIP CLUBS
IN MIAMI.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.542
- WE LOOKED INTO THEM
WHEN I WAS WITH NARCOTICS.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.750
FIGURED THEY WERE USING
THE PLACES TO LAUNDER MONEY,

32:41.750 --> 32:43.458
BUT WE NEVER GOT ANYWHERE
WITH IT.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.041
- LET'S GET SOMEWHERE NOW.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.834
QUINN AND I IS GONNA
TAKE THE FOX HOLE.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.250
THE REST OF YOU SPLIT UP
THE REST OF THE CLUBS.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.458
LET'S GO.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.917
- ALL THE PRINTS
BELONG TO MISS SOROKA

32:52.917 --> 32:56.041
EXCEPT THE ONE
FROM THE TURN SIGNAL.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.500
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY MATCHES

32:57.500 --> 33:01.250
IN FLORIDA AFIS, FBI, OR DHS.

33:02.917 --> 33:05.500
THERE'S ALWAYS INTERPOL.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.792
[door opens]

33:13.291 --> 33:17.709
- I HAD THIS WEIRD FLASHBACK
OF BEING ON RUDY'S TABL--

33:17.709 --> 33:19.041
BRIAN'S TABL--

33:19.041 --> 33:21.458
WHATEVER THE FUCK
YOU WANT TO CALL HIM.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.583
YOUR BROTHER'S TABLE.

33:23.583 --> 33:26.000
- SORRY. THAT MUST HAVE FELT
NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.667
- IT DIDN'T.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.834
BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT IT

33:30.834 --> 33:34.000
IS THAT I WAS SET UP
ON THAT TABLE

33:34.000 --> 33:37.417
THE SAME WAY TRAVIS MARSHALL
WAS SET UP ON THE ALTAR.

33:37.417 --> 33:38.500
- DEB...

33:38.500 --> 33:40.125
- I MEAN,
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

33:40.125 --> 33:42.500
- [scoffs]
I DON'T KNOW.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.000
I WAS THERE TOO.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.166
BUT I PULLED YOU OFF
THAT TABLE.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.667
- I WAS ON THAT TABLE.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.333
I ALMOST DIED ON THAT TABLE.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.834
YOU WOULD THINK THAT I WOULD
REMEMBER EVERY FUCKING DETAIL.

33:54.834 --> 33:58.208
BUT EVEN I DON'T REMEMBER IT
THAT CLEARLY.

33:58.208 --> 34:02.917
DEXTER, YOU WERE SOMEHOW ABLE
TO PERFECTLY DUPLICATE

34:02.917 --> 34:04.709
HOW HE SET EVERYTHING UP--

34:04.709 --> 34:07.875
THE SAME POSITIONING,

34:07.875 --> 34:09.750
THE SAME AMOUNT
OF PLASTIC WRAP.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.208
THEY ARE THE SAME, DEXTER.
THEY ARE EXACTLY...

34:13.208 --> 34:14.542
THE SAME.

34:14.542 --> 34:17.417
- BECAUSE BRIAN
WAS IMITATING ME.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.875
THIS IS CRAZY, DEB.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.333
I KNOW THAT.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.041
IT'S CRAZY THAT I DID
WHAT I DID.

34:24.041 --> 34:26.375
IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU JUST
HAPPENED TO WALK IN

34:26.375 --> 34:28.875
AND SEE ME DOING IT.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.166
AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE CHURCH, ANYWAY?

34:33.041 --> 34:35.208
- JUST...

34:37.250 --> 34:39.542
I-I WAS JUST FUCKING

34:39.542 --> 34:42.542
CHECKING TO SEE
IF EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.250
- [sighs]

34:45.667 --> 34:47.917
- I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE QUESTIONS.

34:47.917 --> 34:50.583
I'M JUST--DEXTER, I'M...

34:50.583 --> 34:53.083
I'M TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.125
- DEB, IT'S NOT GONNA
MAKE SENSE.

35:08.709 --> 35:10.583
- DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
IN THE CAR?

35:10.583 --> 35:12.083
- NO, NOT YET.

35:22.458 --> 35:24.709
GIVE UP, DEB.

35:24.709 --> 35:27.750
GIVE UP
AND JUST LEAVE THIS ALONE.

35:27.750 --> 35:31.291
[computer pinging]

35:31.291 --> 35:34.250
WE HAVE A MATCH.

35:37.375 --> 35:41.667
VIKTOR BASKOV.

35:41.667 --> 35:44.291
WHEN YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL
OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,

35:44.291 --> 35:46.792
IT HELPS TO FOCUS ON
WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT--

35:46.792 --> 35:49.125
MY LITTLE SECRET.

35:55.208 --> 35:56.291
[elevator dings]

36:29.417 --> 36:31.375
I SHOULDN'T BE
DOING A KILL NOW.

36:35.750 --> 36:39.458
THE IRONY IS THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN MAINTAIN CONTROL,

36:39.458 --> 36:41.792
THE ONLY WAY
I CAN KEEP THIS FROM DEB.

36:43.959 --> 36:46.291
SOMEONE PACKED IN A HURRY.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.667
BLOOD...

36:54.083 --> 36:55.291
AND GUNSHOT RESIDUE.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.375
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE OUR MAN,
VIKTOR.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.875
HOW CARELESS WERE YOU,
VIKTOR?

37:02.875 --> 37:05.959
ONE FIRST CLASS ONE-WAY TICKET
TO KIEV, UKRAINE

37:05.959 --> 37:08.709
LEAVING IN LESS
THAN TWO HOURS.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.166
VERY CARELESS.

37:18.625 --> 37:19.709
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

37:19.709 --> 37:23.375
- ONE ECONOMY CLASS TICKET,
FLIGHT 449.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.166
- TO BUDAPEST.

37:26.166 --> 37:27.500
- CORRECT.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.875
- THAT WOULD BE $1,890, PLEASE,
MR. HARTWELL.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.208
- HA. DOG TRACK.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.917
- LUCKY YOU.
- YEAH, LUCKY ME.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.792
- YOU'RE ALL SET.
- THANK YOU.

37:43.125 --> 37:44.917
- STEP THROUGH.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.542
- PLEASE WAIT.
- WAIT, SIR.

37:46.542 --> 37:48.250
WHAT ARE THESE FOR?

37:48.250 --> 37:50.250
- DIABETES.
I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION

37:50.250 --> 37:52.333
IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.250
- GO AHEAD.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.000
- HELLO, VIKTOR.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.291
[dance music playing]

38:12.291 --> 38:14.875
- [indistinct chatter]

38:14.875 --> 38:16.834
- RIGHT HERE, SWEETHEART.

38:16.834 --> 38:19.166
[laughter]

38:23.250 --> 38:25.959
- KILL THE MUSIC.

38:25.959 --> 38:27.458
- GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

38:27.458 --> 38:30.583
I'M SERGEANT BATISTA
FROM MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

38:30.583 --> 38:34.125
WE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE SUSPECTED HOMICIDE

38:34.125 --> 38:36.458
OF ONE KAJA SOROKA...
[girls gasp, murmur]

38:36.458 --> 38:39.542
AS WELL AS THE HOMICIDE
OF A MIAMI METRO POLICE OFFICER,

38:39.542 --> 38:42.500
AND NO ONE IS LEAVING UNTIL
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONED.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.750
- EMPLOYEES OF THE CLUB
UP AGAINST THIS WALL,

38:44.750 --> 38:46.917
AND THE REST OF YOU PERVERTS
UP AGAINST THIS WALL.

38:46.917 --> 38:48.959
- IS THERE A MANAGER HERE?

38:48.959 --> 38:51.166
- YEAH, I'M THE MANAGER.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.709
GEORGE NOVIKOV.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.458
- OH, MY GOD.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.333
AN EMPLOYEE AND A PERVERT.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.834
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WALL
YOU GO TO.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.291
- YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

38:59.291 --> 39:00.750
- YEAH, HE WAS
A LOW-LEVEL SCUMBAG.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.792
NOW I GUESS
HE'S A MID-LEVEL SCUMBAG.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.375
- NICE TO SEE YOU,
DETECTIVE QUINN.

39:07.917 --> 39:10.291
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT
MISS SOROKA?

39:10.291 --> 39:12.834
- KAJA WASN'T THE SMARTEST GIRL
IN THE WORLD.

39:12.834 --> 39:14.250
- NO?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.333
- THESE GIRLS COME HERE FROM
THEIR LITTLE VILLAGES,

39:16.333 --> 39:17.834
STILL STINKING OF COW SHIT.

39:17.834 --> 39:20.625
THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA LAND
SOME RICH AMERICAN HUSBAND.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.041
THEY HOOK UP WITH
THE WRONG GUYS,

39:22.041 --> 39:23.166
THEY END UP OVER THEIR HEADS.

39:23.166 --> 39:24.208
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
HAPPENED?

39:24.208 --> 39:26.667
- I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:26.667 --> 39:30.625
LOOK, I'M SORRY KAJA'S DEAD,
YOU KNOW?

39:30.625 --> 39:32.291
SHE WAS A SWEET KID.

39:32.291 --> 39:35.000
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR POLICE OFFICER TOO.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
BUT THEIR DEATHS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.875
- PERHAPS WE CAN START
WITH YOU SUPPLYING ME

39:38.875 --> 39:40.875
WITH A LIST OF
ALL OF YOUR EMPLOYEES.

39:40.875 --> 39:42.375
- SURE.

39:42.375 --> 39:45.208
CAN I GET A HEAD-COUNT LIST
TO MAIN BAR?

39:45.208 --> 39:46.875
SOMETHING COLD TO DRINK,
DETECTIVE?

39:46.875 --> 39:48.375
- YOUR NAME, PLEASE?

39:48.375 --> 39:50.709
- FOXY RAVEN.

39:52.333 --> 39:55.125
- IS THAT THE NAME YOUR MOTHER
GAVE YOU?

39:55.125 --> 39:58.083
MAYBE YOU COULD SHOW ME
SOME FORM OF ID.

39:58.083 --> 40:00.500
- I DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.291
- NO, OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

40:03.291 --> 40:05.500
- ONE OF OUR GUYS FOUND BLOOD
OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.834
- EXCUSE ME, SIR,
I HAVE YOUR WHEELCHAIR.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.417
- I DON'T NEED A WHEEL...

40:39.417 --> 40:41.375
[groans]

40:52.583 --> 40:54.583
- IT NEVER MATTERS
YOUR DESTINATION.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.375
THE SMART TRAVELER
MUST BE PREPARED

40:56.375 --> 40:59.542
TO MAKE LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.750
- LIEUTENANT,
YOU GOT A SECOND?

41:20.750 --> 41:22.458
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

41:22.458 --> 41:24.625
- WE SHUT DOWN THE STRIP CLUB,

41:24.625 --> 41:26.125
QUESTIONED EVERYONE,
BUT DIDN'T GET SHIT.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.500
- WE KNOW SHE WORKED LAST NIGHT.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.375
SHE SIGNED IN AT 10:00,
NEVER SIGNED OUT.

41:29.375 --> 41:31.417
- AND WE FOUND BLOOD
IN THE PARKING LOT

41:31.417 --> 41:33.458
WHICH WE BELIEVE BELONGS
TO MISS SOROKA.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.667
BUT WITH ALL THAT, WE STILL
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.458
- NO ONE SAW HER LEAVE?
- NO.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.792
NO ONE REMEMBERS ANY CUSTOMERS
SHE MIGHT HAVE TALKED TO.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.959
NO ONE REMEMBERS SEEING HER CAR
IN THE PARKING LOT.

41:41.959 --> 41:43.375
NO ONE SAW SHIT.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.333
- AND IT'S LIKE
SHE'S A FUCKING GHOST

41:45.333 --> 41:46.917
IN A G-STRING.
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.500
SHE WALKED OUT OF A PACKED CLUB
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER SHIFT.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
SOMEONE SAW SOMETHING.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.125
- THESE PLACES
ARE ALL MOBBED UP--

41:51.125 --> 41:52.500
RUSSIAN,
UKRAINIAN ORGANIZED CRIME.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.166
THOSE STRIPPERS
WERE BROUGHT IN THERE.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.500
THEY KNOW NOT TO TALK.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.750
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE US
TO PROCEED?

41:56.750 --> 41:58.500
- SHUT DOWN
EVERY ONE OF THEIR CLUBS

41:58.500 --> 42:00.208
EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK
UNTIL SOMEONE TALKS.

42:00.208 --> 42:01.500
- OKAY.
WE'RE ON IT.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.792
I'M GONNA NEED MORE COFFEE.
COFFEE TRUCK?

42:02.792 --> 42:05.166
- I ALREADY GOT SO MUCH CAFFEINE
IN MY HEAD,

42:05.166 --> 42:06.500
I CAN BARELY THINK STRAIGHT.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.709
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

42:07.709 --> 42:09.500
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYTHING
DONE TONIGHT.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.834
JUST GO HOME.

42:11.834 --> 42:14.709
IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG,
VERY FUCKED UP DAY.

42:14.709 --> 42:17.959
- I'M TOO WORKED UP TO SLEEP,
BUT I COULD USE A DRINK.

42:17.959 --> 42:20.625
WANNA HEAD ACROSS THE STREET,
KNOCK ONE BACK IN MIKE'S HONOR?

42:20.625 --> 42:22.208
- LEAD THE WAY.
- YOU'RE COMING, LIEUTENANT?

42:22.208 --> 42:24.875
- RAIN CHECK.
BUT SLAM A DOUBLE FOR ME.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.166
- SURE.

42:26.166 --> 42:27.709
GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

42:27.709 --> 42:29.250
- GOOD NIGHT.

42:33.917 --> 42:35.375
- WHAT'S UP, LIEUTENANT?

42:35.375 --> 42:36.750
- ANY PROGRESS?

42:36.750 --> 42:39.041
- WE KNOW OUR SHOOTER
WAS WEARING

42:39.041 --> 42:42.333
SIZE TEN PRADA SHOES,
VERY PRICEY.

42:42.333 --> 42:44.125
WE KNOW HE WAS RIGHT-HANDED.

42:44.125 --> 42:46.417
SO THAT NARROWS
IT DOWN TO ABOUT

42:46.417 --> 42:47.750
800 MILLION PEOPLE.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.667
- DEXTER HERE?
- NO.

42:49.667 --> 42:52.417
I TOLD HIM I'D WORK LATE
IF HE CAME IN EARLY.

42:57.667 --> 43:00.375
- SCOTCH AND WHATEVER MY FRIEND
IS HAVING.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.792
- I'LL HAVE A VODKA.

43:01.792 --> 43:03.500
- DON'T YOU MEAN
SHIRLEY TEMPLE?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.583
- WHAT?
I CAN'T TOAST TO MIKE?

43:09.250 --> 43:10.792
TO MIKE.

43:10.792 --> 43:12.542
- TO MIKE.

43:16.542 --> 43:18.083
- WHAT IF YOUR UNION REP
SEES YOU?

43:18.083 --> 43:19.583
AREN'T YOU IN
SOME KIND OF PROGRAM?

43:19.583 --> 43:21.875
- I START NEXT WEEK.
- THAT'S GOOD.

43:21.875 --> 43:23.417
THE SOONER YOU ADDRESS
YOUR PROBLEM THE BETTER,

43:23.417 --> 43:24.875
'CAUSE I'M TIRED
OF YOUR BULLSHIT.

43:24.875 --> 43:26.250
- IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU'RE
STILL BREAKING MY BALLS?

43:26.250 --> 43:27.542
- YOU LOSE ONE GIRLFRIEND,

43:27.542 --> 43:28.750
AND THE WHEELS
COMPLETELY COME OFF.

43:28.750 --> 43:29.917
- I'M A SENSITIVE GUY.

43:29.917 --> 43:32.750
- I LOST TWO WIVES
AND COUNTLESS GIRLFRIENDS,

43:32.750 --> 43:34.667
AND SOMEHOW I MANAGED
TO KEEP MY SHIT TOGETHER.

43:34.667 --> 43:36.542
- YEAH, I WISH MY LIFE
WAS MORE LIKE YOURS.

43:36.542 --> 43:38.000
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIVING
A FUCKING DREAM.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.417
- KEEP IT UP.

43:39.417 --> 43:40.959
I'LL PUT IT FOR THAT TRANSFER
AFTER ALL.

43:40.959 --> 43:43.083
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE UNION
SAYS--I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

43:43.083 --> 43:46.750
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
PUT IN FOR MY TRANSFER.

43:46.750 --> 43:48.834
- I DIDN'T QUITE
GET AROUND TO IT.

43:48.834 --> 43:50.375
- SO YOU WERE JUST
FUCKING WITH ME?

43:50.375 --> 43:51.750
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO LEAVE.

43:51.750 --> 43:53.417
YOU WERE ONLY TRYING
TO GET ME TO SHAPE UP.

43:53.417 --> 43:55.375
- A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID.

43:55.375 --> 43:58.291
- YOU STILL FUCKING LOVE ME.
- FUCK YOU.

43:58.291 --> 43:59.625
I TRY TO HELP YOU,

43:59.625 --> 44:01.041
AND YOU GO RUNNING
TO YOUR UNION REP

44:01.041 --> 44:02.709
[whispers]
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

44:02.709 --> 44:04.709
THAT WAS WEAK.

44:04.709 --> 44:06.917
- WELL, ACTUALLY...
- WHAT?

44:06.917 --> 44:08.750
- I PLAN ON TALKING TO HIM

44:08.750 --> 44:10.542
AS SOON AS I FIND OUT
WHO HE IS.

44:10.542 --> 44:13.458
- WHAT ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THING
YOU'RE IN?

44:13.458 --> 44:15.166
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE

44:15.166 --> 44:16.625
A DRINKING PROBLEM.

44:16.625 --> 44:19.000
OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST ME
IN DENIAL--WHO KNOWS?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.625
WE MAY NEVER GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

44:20.625 --> 44:23.417
- YEAH, DO WHAT--
JUST DEAL WITH YOUR SHIT.

44:23.417 --> 44:27.291
MIKE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER
COP THAN WE'LL EVER BE.

44:27.291 --> 44:29.834
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

44:35.834 --> 44:37.875
[Viktor grunts]

44:41.250 --> 44:44.250
- HELLO, VIKTOR.

44:44.250 --> 44:47.667
- WHERE AM I?

44:47.667 --> 44:50.792
- YOU'RE IN A PLACE WHERE THINGS
ARE FORGOTTEN.

44:52.917 --> 44:56.500
NEVER TO BE USED OR SEEN
OR TOUCHED AGAIN.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
- [grunts]

44:58.500 --> 45:01.750
- IT SEEMS FITTING
FOR A COP KILLER.

45:01.750 --> 45:05.917
NOT TO DISMISS KAJA SOROKA.
SHE COUNTS TOO.

45:05.917 --> 45:06.917
- WHO ARE YOU?

45:06.917 --> 45:08.834
- GOOD QUESTION.

45:10.875 --> 45:14.500
IT ALL DEPENDS
ON WHO YOU ASK.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.875
- WHO SENT YOU?

45:16.875 --> 45:18.500
HMM?

45:18.500 --> 45:20.959
YOU SHOULD NOT FUCK WITH ME.

45:20.959 --> 45:23.333
I HAVE VERY DANGEROUS FRIENDS.

45:23.333 --> 45:25.375
- IF YOU KNEW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE HEARD THAT

45:25.375 --> 45:26.917
OVER THE YEARS....

45:26.917 --> 45:28.417
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
MONEY?

45:28.417 --> 45:30.500
I CAN GET YOU A LOT OF MONEY.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.792
- I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT TOO.

45:31.792 --> 45:33.500
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

45:33.500 --> 45:35.125
- YOU WANT THE LONG VERSION?

45:35.125 --> 45:37.208
THAT COULD TAKE
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

45:37.208 --> 45:38.709
- SHORT VERSION.

45:40.709 --> 45:44.917
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO.
BECAUSE I NEED CONTROL.

45:48.041 --> 45:51.917
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS
GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.000
- YOU ARE CRAZY.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.208
- THERE'S REALLY NO NEED
FOR NAME CALLING, VIKTOR.

46:02.709 --> 46:05.083
- [grunts]

46:05.083 --> 46:08.625
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO KEEP YOU FROM KILLING ME?

46:08.625 --> 46:09.834
- NO.

46:09.834 --> 46:12.375
- THEN GET IT OVER WITH!

46:16.208 --> 46:19.291
- NORMALLY,
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS.

46:19.291 --> 46:20.417
- [grunts]

46:20.417 --> 46:22.250
- BUT IN THIS CASE...

46:22.250 --> 46:25.625
[beep]
[music in background]

46:25.625 --> 46:28.208
[phone ringing]

46:32.041 --> 46:35.291
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

46:40.500 --> 46:41.792
- THIS IS ISAAK.

46:41.792 --> 46:44.083
- VIKTOR LEFT
ON AN EVENING FLIGHT.

46:44.083 --> 46:47.333
HE ARRIVES IN KIEV AT 5:25 P.M.,
YOUR TIME.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.000
- GOOD.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.125
WHAT ABOUT
THE DEAD POLICE OFFICER?

46:51.125 --> 46:52.667
- IT'S STILL A PROBLEM,

46:52.667 --> 46:56.625
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE SHIT ON US,
SO...

46:56.625 --> 46:58.250
I'LL MAKE IT GO AWAY.

46:58.250 --> 46:59.542
- GOOD.

46:59.542 --> 47:00.792
[beep]

47:10.333 --> 47:12.917
- RIDDING THE WORLD OF PEOPLE
LIKE VIKTOR

47:12.917 --> 47:15.458
IS THE ONE THING I'M GOOD AT.

47:15.458 --> 47:18.208
AND WHEN I'M STRESSED NEAR
TO THE BREAKING POINT LIKE NOW,

47:18.208 --> 47:20.166
IT CENTERS ME.

47:20.166 --> 47:23.625
MAYBE NOTHING HAS TO CHANGE
WITH DEB.

47:42.458 --> 47:45.000
[whimpers]

47:50.458 --> 47:53.625
[treadmill powering down]

48:00.750 --> 48:02.375
[phone dialing]

48:02.375 --> 48:04.208
[line ringing]

48:04.208 --> 48:05.875
- HELLO?

48:07.333 --> 48:08.750
- HI, JAMIE.
IS DEXTER THERE?

48:08.750 --> 48:09.917
IT'S DEB.

48:09.917 --> 48:12.792
- NO, HE'S WORKING LATE.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.333
- HE'S AT WORK?

48:14.333 --> 48:15.959
- MM-HMM, YEAH.

48:15.959 --> 48:17.792
HE SAID WITH MIKE'S SHOOTING
AND EVERYTHING,

48:17.792 --> 48:19.834
HE MIGHT BE THERE ALL NIGHT.

48:19.834 --> 48:21.625
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

48:21.625 --> 48:25.875
UM, DOES THAT HAPPEN A LOT?

48:28.208 --> 48:30.542
I MEAN, I KNOW I SHOULD KNOW
HIS HOURS AND EVERYTHING.

48:30.542 --> 48:33.709
IT'S JUST THAT I'M ALWAYS
JUGGLING THINGS, SO...

48:33.709 --> 48:36.834
- OH, YEAH,
HE WORKS CRAZY HOURS.

48:36.834 --> 48:40.750
LOTS OF NIGHTS
TILL 3:00, 4:00 A.M.

48:43.291 --> 48:45.417
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, THANKS.

48:45.417 --> 48:48.375
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO HAVE HIM CALL YOU?

48:48.375 --> 48:50.375
- NO.
UM...

48:50.375 --> 48:52.750
NO, I'LL SEE HIM
AT WORK TOMORROW.

48:52.750 --> 48:54.041
- OKAY.

48:54.041 --> 48:55.875
- GOOD NIGHT.

49:16.083 --> 49:19.041
[toy squeaks]

49:19.041 --> 49:20.333
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

49:20.333 --> 49:22.542
- BANJO.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.166
- ARE YOU OKAY?

49:24.166 --> 49:25.208
- NO.

49:25.208 --> 49:28.125
WHY DID DADDY TAKE
THE REAL BANJO AWAY?

49:28.125 --> 49:29.583
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

49:29.583 --> 49:31.750
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

49:31.750 --> 49:33.875
IT'S ME.
IT'S MY FAULT.

49:33.875 --> 49:36.166
- WHY?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

49:38.792 --> 49:41.041
- DEXTER'S ALLERGIC TO DOGS,
SWEETIE.

49:41.041 --> 49:43.750
THAT'S WHY
WE CAN'T HAVE THEM.

49:46.125 --> 49:48.208
SORRY.

49:48.208 --> 49:50.917
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO TELL HER?

49:50.917 --> 49:53.500
- THE TRUTH.
- WHAT IS THE TRUTH?

49:53.500 --> 49:55.458
- THAT YOU
GOT RID OF THE DOG

49:55.458 --> 49:57.125
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I MIGHT KILL IT.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.458
BUT I WOULDN'T.

49:58.458 --> 50:00.250
- I COULDN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.375
BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT

50:02.375 --> 50:06.625
IS THAT YOU MUSTN'T EVER TELL
DEBRA THE TRUTH ABOUT YOURSELF.

50:06.625 --> 50:07.875
- WHY?

50:07.875 --> 50:10.125
- IF YOU THINK SHE'S UPSET NOW,

50:10.125 --> 50:12.417
THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO HOW SHE'D FEEL

50:12.417 --> 50:14.667
IF SHE LEARNED WHAT YOU ARE.

50:14.667 --> 50:15.709
SHE'D BE TERRIFIED.

50:15.709 --> 50:18.083
- BUT SHE LOVES ME.

50:18.083 --> 50:20.792
- DEX, SHE LOVES
WHO SHE THINKS YOU ARE.

50:20.792 --> 50:24.208
IF SHE EVER SAW THE REAL YOU,
SHE'D NEVER GET OVER IT.

50:24.208 --> 50:28.041
SON, YOUR MOTHER AND I AREN'T
GONNA BE AROUND FOREVER.

50:28.041 --> 50:30.333
SOMEDAY DEBRA WILL BE
ALL YOU HAVE LEFT.

50:30.333 --> 50:33.500
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE HER,
DO YOU?

50:37.834 --> 50:40.667
- MY MISTAKE WAS STEPPING
OUTSIDE THE CODE.

50:40.667 --> 50:43.500
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED TRAVIS
THE INSTANT I MET HIM

50:43.500 --> 50:45.625
RATHER THAN TRY TO SAVE HIM.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.667
COMPASSION DOES NOT FIT ME.

50:47.667 --> 50:49.834
[engine revving]

51:16.542 --> 51:20.041
- YOU'RE READY?
- YES, I'M READY TO JOIN YOU.

51:20.041 --> 51:23.333
BUT I CAN'T.
NOT DEB.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.333
- [gasps]

51:28.333 --> 51:31.375
- NO. YOU CAN'T BE A KILLER
AND A HERO.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.333
- VINCENT,
YOU'RE WORKING LATE.

51:51.333 --> 51:53.709
- YEAH, WELL, LOTS TO DO.

51:53.709 --> 51:55.750
EVERYONE'S DOING DOUBLE SHIFTS.
- HMM.

51:55.750 --> 51:57.875
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON
MIKE'S CASE

51:57.875 --> 51:59.333
AND THAT'S TOP PRIORITY,

51:59.333 --> 52:01.083
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF ANYONE HAD A CHANCE

52:01.083 --> 52:03.000
TO GO THROUGH THE EVIDENCE
FROM THE CHURCH.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.041
- SORRY.

52:04.041 --> 52:06.041
IT'S ALL IN THOSE BOXES
OVER THERE,

52:06.041 --> 52:07.834
BUT I'M KIND OF SWAMPED HERE.

52:07.834 --> 52:09.417
- OF COURSE.

52:14.458 --> 52:16.166
HEY, DOES OUR FORENSICS TEAM

52:16.166 --> 52:17.542
EVER TAKE BLOOD SLIDES
AT CRIME SCENES?

52:17.542 --> 52:18.959
- NO.

52:18.959 --> 52:21.542
IF ANY OF THE EVIDENCE
IS TRANSPORTABLE, WE BAG IT.

52:21.542 --> 52:22.750
OTHERWISE, IF IT'S BLOOD,

52:22.750 --> 52:25.709
WE ABSORB IT INTO COTTON
SQUARES, THEN WE BAG IT.

52:25.709 --> 52:27.291
- I SEE.

52:27.291 --> 52:28.875
- THE ONLY ONE PERSON WHO EVER
WORKED AT MIAMI METRO

52:28.875 --> 52:30.000
EVER TOOK BLOOD SLIDES.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.291
- AND THAT WAS?

52:31.291 --> 52:32.375
- SERGEANT DOAKES.

52:32.375 --> 52:34.166
AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
OF HIS SIDE GIG

52:34.166 --> 52:36.166
AS THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

52:40.625 --> 52:41.959
- RIGHT.

52:41.959 --> 52:43.625
OF COURSE, SERGEANT DOAKES.

52:45.291 --> 52:47.291
THANK YOU.

52:47.291 --> 52:51.667
- NONE OF US WANT TO BE
FULLY REVEALED,

52:51.667 --> 52:54.709
ALL OUR FAULTS AND WEAKNESSES
LAID BARE FOR THE WORLD TO SEE.

52:56.333 --> 52:58.250
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO MAKE SURE

52:58.250 --> 53:01.792
I NEVER AGAIN STRAY
FROM WHAT HARRY TAUGHT ME.

53:37.333 --> 53:40.542
- DID YOU KILL
ALL THESE PEOPLE?

53:45.834 --> 53:47.875
- I DID.

53:51.792 --> 53:55.750
- ARE YOU--

53:55.750 --> 53:59.208
ARE YOU A SERIAL KILLER?

54:01.250 --> 54:04.166
- YES.
