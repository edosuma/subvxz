00:00.433 --> 00:02.200
-[Judy] You two were neighbors?
-Yes.

00:03.967 --> 00:06.166
I was in my garage
working on my bike.

00:06.233 --> 00:07.834
He choked me
until I couldn't breathe.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.700
And what happened next?

00:10.767 --> 00:11.800
I punched him.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.000
You punched him?

00:14.066 --> 00:15.266
Yeah. Yes.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.767
Yes, that would be a yes.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.300

<i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

00:19.367 --> 00:22.400
[dramatic music]

00:35.233 --> 00:39.367
<i>Don Schulze is suing</i>
<i>his neighbor, Varlin Davoudi,</i>

00:39.433 --> 00:43.000

00:43.066 --> 00:45.667
[Kevin] All rise.
Court, come to order.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.667
Be seated, please.

00:50.734 --> 00:51.667
[Kevin] Good morning, Judge.

00:51.734 --> 00:53.900
We have case number 1027,
Schulze versus Davoudi.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.233
Thank you.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.500
Thank you.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.033
Mr. Schultz,
you and Mr. Davoudi--

00:59.100 --> 01:00.100
[Varlin] Yes, ma'am.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.100
-[Judy] --are neighbors.
-Yes.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.600
[Judy] You've been living
in your present apartment

01:03.667 --> 01:06.700
for the last 42 years,
according to your complaint.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.700
Yes, ma'am.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.233
[Judy] The defendant
moved in with his mother

01:10.300 --> 01:12.033
a couple of years ago.
How long ago?

01:12.100 --> 01:14.934
Off and on since
my mom and dad got sick.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.133
I've been going back and forth,

01:16.200 --> 01:19.467
but permanently moved in
about last November.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.266
So a year.
You moved in full-time

01:21.333 --> 01:22.900
because you have to care
for your mother?

01:22.967 --> 01:24.734
Correct.
And my dad passed away.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.700
How old is your mom?

01:25.767 --> 01:27.066
-Eighty.
-[Judy] She's a kid!

01:27.133 --> 01:29.200
Still young at heart.
Just like you.

01:29.266 --> 01:31.000
She have any health problems?

01:31.066 --> 01:34.433
Yes, heart problems. Diabetes.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.633
You moved in alone?

01:35.700 --> 01:36.700
Yes.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.633
What kind of work
do you do, Mr. Davoudi?

01:38.700 --> 01:40.266
I do credit restoration, ma'am.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.433
Is it your own company?

01:41.500 --> 01:42.767
No. I work for a company.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.834
And you, Mr. Schulze,
what kind of work do you do?

01:44.900 --> 01:47.200
I'm semi-retired,
and I'm also an author.

01:47.266 --> 01:48.734
Semi-retired from what?

01:48.800 --> 01:49.767
I worked on computers.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.900
Tell me what size
apartment you have.

01:51.967 --> 01:54.900
It's a house,
and there's two separate units.

01:54.967 --> 01:56.233
So you live on one side,

01:56.300 --> 01:58.600
Mr. Davoudi and his mother
are now on the other?

01:58.667 --> 02:00.133
-That's correct.
-Front and back.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.333
So it's the same building?

02:01.400 --> 02:02.333
It's the same building.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.633
And what is your rent?

02:03.700 --> 02:04.834
Seven twenty-one a month.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.133
How many bedrooms do you have?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.533
-One.
-And that's rent-controlled?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.567
Yes, it is.

02:08.633 --> 02:09.800
Do you have any idea,
Mr. Schultz,

02:09.867 --> 02:13.133
how much would your apartment be
on the open market today?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.000
Probably 1,800 a month.

02:15.066 --> 02:16.734
Your landlord
would love you to move.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.734
Yes, ma'am.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.133
-[Judy laughs]
-Very much.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.967
I bet. Does your mother
pay rent to the landlord?

02:22.033 --> 02:22.967
Of course.

02:23.033 --> 02:24.600
-What is her rent?
-Eighteen fifty.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.066
And it's the same size
apartment?

02:26.133 --> 02:27.433
Ours is smaller, I believe.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.900
This unfortunate situation
is about the two of you

02:29.967 --> 02:31.200
who don't get along.

02:31.266 --> 02:33.000
Each of you claim
that the other assaulted them

02:33.066 --> 02:35.400
on a particular day.
And that was--

02:35.467 --> 02:37.266
Have to get my glasses on.

02:38.367 --> 02:42.133
Whitney, Whitney,
you don't wear glasses.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.700
This happened
on a series of days,

02:44.767 --> 02:47.166
but I think that the day
we're talking about,

02:47.233 --> 02:51.467
the alleged assault happened
on the 29th of November, 2020.

02:51.533 --> 02:54.934
So let's talk about
that date, Mr. Schulze.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.133
I want you to tell me,
where were you

02:57.200 --> 02:59.500
on the 29th of November, 2020?

02:59.567 --> 03:01.567
I was in my garage
working on my bike.

03:01.633 --> 03:04.400
And that's a garage
that you share with Mr. Davoudi,

03:04.467 --> 03:05.967
or you don't share
with Mr. Davoudi?

03:06.033 --> 03:08.734
No, it's a garage
that it's my own garage.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.900
And he has another garage
next to mine.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.934
You were in your garage.
Did he come to your garage?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.033
-Yes.
-[Judy] And tell me,

03:16.100 --> 03:18.567
slowly, what happened.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.300
You're in your garage,
fixing your bike and--

03:21.367 --> 03:24.033
Mr. Davoudi was walking
down the driveway,

03:24.100 --> 03:25.200
and he was talking to me.

03:25.266 --> 03:26.800
And I couldn't figure out
what he was saying.

03:26.867 --> 03:29.467
He said, "That was very uncool
of you to tell the landlord

03:29.533 --> 03:32.600
that I was unpacking my stuff
in the backyard."

03:32.667 --> 03:34.633
Had you told
the landlord anything

03:34.700 --> 03:36.800
about Mr. Davoudi's stuff?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.033
Yes. I asked him--

03:38.100 --> 03:39.667
Shh, just second.
What had you seen,

03:39.734 --> 03:41.700
and what had you told
the landlord?

03:41.767 --> 03:44.033
I'd seen him spread his stuff
all over the backyard.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.433
What stuff? What stuff?

03:45.500 --> 03:48.500
Clothes, equipment, belongings.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.567
I assumed he was moving them
from one house to another.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.100
Well, why did you think
that that required

03:52.166 --> 03:54.066
a telephone call
to the landlord?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.533
Because it had been there
for three days,

03:55.600 --> 03:56.767
and I'd asked him to move it.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.233
Okay. Where were you,
and what did you say to him?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.333
I just said,
"Are you gonna be moving this?"

04:01.400 --> 04:03.033
And he said, "I'll move it
when I'm ready."

04:03.100 --> 04:04.567
Okay. And?

04:04.633 --> 04:06.633
And so I said, "Okay."
And I called the landlord

04:06.700 --> 04:08.633
and I-- or I texted the landlord

04:08.700 --> 04:10.767
and I told him that he's got
his stuff all over the place.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.033
I can't do anything.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.734
And would you please ask him
to move it or clean it up?

04:14.800 --> 04:16.467
Was it ultimately moved?

04:16.533 --> 04:17.967
Over a long period of time.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.767
-Was it ultimately moved?
-[Don] Yes.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.300
Do you know if it was put
out for trash, or just moved?

04:22.367 --> 04:24.300
It was all basically
still there,

04:24.367 --> 04:26.066
just moved and compiled into

04:26.133 --> 04:27.066
different sections
of the backyard.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.166
That was on his side
of the house?

04:29.233 --> 04:30.934
No, the backyard
is a common area.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.333
I know, but you're not
going in back of his house.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.233
If the house is divided in half,
you would stay on your side.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.266
Okay.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.433
So, was it compacted and moved

04:39.500 --> 04:43.367
onto the part of the backyard
that looks as if it's attached

04:43.433 --> 04:44.767
to his side of the house?

04:44.834 --> 04:47.433
It was all over the backyard.
It was lining the backyard.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.567
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

04:48.633 --> 04:49.800
-Once he moved it.
-[Don] Okay.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.367
Are you being thick,
or you just don't understand?

04:52.433 --> 04:55.433
No, he didn't. It was lined
throughout the entire backyard.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.667
It wasn't in one area.

04:56.734 --> 04:58.567
I said to you,
once he moved it,

04:58.633 --> 05:01.400
you said ultimately,
he moved it, he moved it

05:01.467 --> 05:03.100
-into one side of the backyard.
-[Don] Okay.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.967
I asked you
a simple question.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.066
The simple question was,

05:06.133 --> 05:09.033
did he move it to
a part of the backyard

05:09.100 --> 05:12.066
that looks as if
it's part of his backyard

05:12.133 --> 05:14.066
rather than a part
of your backyard?

05:14.133 --> 05:15.500
-Yeah. Yes.
-[Judy] Yes,

05:15.567 --> 05:17.133
-that would be a yes.
-Yeah, sure.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.100
And you say that
that took a couple of days.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.133
Took a long time,
longer than a couple of days.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.934
I assume you got a call
from the landlord.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.600
Don't tell me
what the landlord said to you.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.166
-No, actually he never did.
-[Judy] Hmm?

05:26.233 --> 05:28.266
He never did because
those were gone within a day.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.500
That was the day I moved.

05:29.567 --> 05:30.834
That was the day
you moved in?

05:30.900 --> 05:32.767
Correct. Like I said before,
it was November.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.066
So that's when it happened.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.734
And he said it was three months
before, which is a lie, again.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.000
I'm here as a peacemaker.

05:39.066 --> 05:40.000
Thank you, ma'am.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.600
-I'm trying to be a peacemaker--
-[Varlin] Thank you.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.166
[Judy] --because there's no question.

05:44.233 --> 05:45.233
-You are not--
-That's why I love you.

05:45.300 --> 05:49.166
You are not moving with your
80-year-old mother anywhere.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.934
And Mr. Schulze, who has
the deal of a lifetime--

05:52.000 --> 05:52.934
[Varlin] Mm-mm.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.533
[Judy] --which allows him
to go bike-riding,

05:54.600 --> 05:56.934
and be semi-retired
and a novelist--

05:57.000 --> 05:57.934
[Varlin] Right.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.200
[Judy] --instead of working,
he's not moving anywhere.

06:01.266 --> 06:02.633
And harassing.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.166
So, Mr. Davoudi,
I want you to understand.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.700
I would ordinarily say
to one of you,

06:07.767 --> 06:08.967
listen, you gotta move.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.433
You know, life is too short
to be attached to somebody

06:11.500 --> 06:14.033
that you not only don't love,
but you can't stand.

06:14.133 --> 06:15.066
Absolutely.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.734
Okay. So you gotta
learn to coexist.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.100
I know that that's hard,

06:19.166 --> 06:21.100
but you really have to
learn to coexist.

06:21.166 --> 06:22.700
Right. And I--

06:22.767 --> 06:24.667
[shushes]

06:26.333 --> 06:29.033
So he moved his stuff,
Mr. Schulze.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.767
-[clears throat]
-And then, according to you,

06:31.834 --> 06:35.333
he came up to you
in the garage and said,

06:35.400 --> 06:37.834
"Wasn't cool of you
to call the landlord."

06:37.900 --> 06:38.767
That's correct.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.900
And what happened next?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.500
I stood up.
He kept walking towards me.

06:42.567 --> 06:43.567
We got very close.

06:43.633 --> 06:44.900
How close?

06:44.967 --> 06:46.867
Close enough to
almost butt heads.

06:46.934 --> 06:49.367
When you got up,
did you remain in your garage?

06:49.433 --> 06:50.467
Yes, I did.

06:50.533 --> 06:52.900
So he actually came
into your garage?

06:52.967 --> 06:53.834
Yes.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.467
Mr. Schulze, you have
to be very careful with me.

06:56.533 --> 06:59.100
Are you telling me
that Mr. Davoudi

06:59.166 --> 07:02.133
stepped into your garage?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.467
-No.
-[Judy] Let's be very careful.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.834
So he did not come
into your garage.

07:06.900 --> 07:10.967
So you stood up and walked
out of your garage towards him?

07:11.033 --> 07:12.266
-As he was walking
towards me,

07:12.333 --> 07:13.367
I walked towards him, yes.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.233
That's a more truthful answer.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.200
Okay. That's true.

07:17.266 --> 07:19.333
How do I know that?
I know everything.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.633
[dramatic music]

07:20.700 --> 07:21.767
-[Judy] Answer my question.
-I couldn't bring the food

07:21.834 --> 07:24.100
inside because the two cats
couldn't come in.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.767
What do you mean,
they couldn't come in?

07:25.834 --> 07:27.667
-At that time when we started--
-That's what I mean,

07:27.734 --> 07:29.533
they couldn't come in
at that time.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
Kevin, would you have a
conversation with the plaintiff

07:31.667 --> 07:33.367
and tell him
that there's only one person

07:33.433 --> 07:34.800
that raises their voice here?

07:34.867 --> 07:36.700
Thank you.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.967
[narrator] <i>Don Schulze says</i>
<i>his neighbor Varlin Davoudi</i>

07:49.033 --> 07:50.800
<i>owes him for an assault.</i>

07:50.867 --> 07:53.667
<i>Varlin is countersuing</i>
<i>for the same assault</i>

07:53.734 --> 07:56.333
<i>and wrongfully</i>
<i>towing his car.</i>

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
So, you got up from the bike.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.133
Didn't stay by the bike,
but you walked towards him,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.000
and he was walking towards you.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.367
And he said,
"That was very uncool."

08:05.433 --> 08:09.000
And now you're standing
toe to toe, close to each other.

08:09.066 --> 08:10.633
What's the next thing
that happened?

08:10.700 --> 08:14.066
Before you tell me the story,
make very, very sure

08:14.133 --> 08:16.000
that I don't catch you
in another fib.

08:16.066 --> 08:17.467
Do you understand?

08:17.533 --> 08:19.133
You didn't catch me in a fib.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.567
Let's go back, Whitney.

08:21.633 --> 08:26.667
Let's go back to where
he first discusses where he was

08:26.734 --> 08:30.233
when the defendant
came up to him and he--

08:30.300 --> 08:33.300
if my memory is correct,
something about he didn't move.

08:34.633 --> 08:35.600
[Whitney] Let's see.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.767
The question that I asked him,
whether or not he stood up,

08:37.834 --> 08:41.066
and whether or not the defendant
came into the garage.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.400
Yes. He said,
"Close enough to only

08:42.467 --> 08:44.200
butt heads, foreheads,
touch heads."

08:44.266 --> 08:46.233
And you said, "You got up.
When you got up,

08:46.300 --> 08:48.100
did you remain in your garage?"

08:48.166 --> 08:49.633
And he said, "Yes, I did."

08:49.700 --> 08:50.633
That's not true.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.900
You didn't remain
in your garage.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.433
You walked towards him,
and you left the garage.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.166
I walked towards him after that.

08:56.233 --> 08:57.133
After what?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.800
After he started talking to me
and was walking towards me.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.367
-Nah. Nah. Nah.
-You asked me if he stood up.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.333
-No, no. Mr. Schulze--
-All right.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.000
-[Judy] Mr. Schulze--
-Look, I misunderstood

09:05.066 --> 09:06.033
the question then, ma'am.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.967
Then you misunderstood the question.

09:08.033 --> 09:09.667
-So now I'm gonna get back to--
-All right.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.200
Now, you're walking towards him.

09:11.266 --> 09:14.133
He's walking towards you--
face to face.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.600
And what happened next?

09:15.667 --> 09:17.300
He grabbed me
by the throat.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.367
-He put his--
-[Don] And he choked me

09:18.433 --> 09:20.033
-to where I couldn't breathe.
-[Judy] Just a second.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.433
He walked up to you.
And the first thing

09:21.500 --> 09:23.934
that he did to you was
put his hands around your neck?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.600
He put his one hand
around my neck.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.100
Okay.
And what happened next?

09:27.166 --> 09:28.633
He choked me
until I couldn't breathe.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.533
With his one hand?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.300
-[Don] Yeah.
-And what happened next?

09:31.367 --> 09:32.767
I punched him
to get his hand off me.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.367
You punched him where?

09:34.433 --> 09:36.100
-In the face.
-[Judy] And then what happened?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.934
-And he let go.
-And then what happened?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.800
And I walked back,
and I called the police.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.066
Went back where?

09:41.133 --> 09:42.066
Towards my house.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.467
Were you going
through the garage,

09:43.533 --> 09:45.533
or were you going through
the entrance to the house?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.533
Well, I was walking back
up the driveway to my house.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.467
Where were you
when you called the police?

09:49.533 --> 09:50.533
I was in my house.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.633
So you went from his,
putting his hand on you,

09:53.700 --> 09:56.800
you punched him in the face.
You went into the house...

09:56.867 --> 09:57.834
Right.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.533
...picked up the phone
and called the police.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.500
It was my cell phone.
I had my cell phone with me.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.834
And ultimately,
the police came to your house

10:03.900 --> 10:06.767
and asked you for a report
of the events.

10:06.834 --> 10:07.767
Right.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.767
And you told the police
what you just told me.

10:09.834 --> 10:10.767
Yes.

10:10.834 --> 10:13.767
[Judy] That the defendant came
onto your driveway,

10:13.834 --> 10:17.967
said something to you, "Not cool
of you to call the landlord."

10:19.166 --> 10:22.467
Then put one hand around
your neck and left a mark--

10:22.533 --> 10:24.500
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] --on your neck,

10:24.567 --> 10:28.633
and you punched him in order
to let him let go of your throat.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.266
-Right.
-And then you went back

10:30.333 --> 10:32.834
into your house
and waited for the police.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.834
Yep.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.433
Now, prior to this incident
on the 29th,

10:36.500 --> 10:40.300
you had had some prior
confrontations with Mr. Davoudi,

10:40.367 --> 10:42.800
according to the complaint,
about your cats?

10:42.867 --> 10:43.700
Yes, ma'am.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.133
How many cats do you have?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.266
One cat that's inside,
and three outside.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.734
Did the three outside cats
ever come inside?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.000
Once in a while, yes.

10:51.066 --> 10:52.600
Are they fed
inside or outside?

10:52.667 --> 10:53.600
Both.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.867
So they do come inside?

10:54.934 --> 10:56.533
-Yes, they do.
-But I assume you only keep

10:56.600 --> 10:59.400
one litter box for
the one cat that's inside.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.567
I have two litter boxes.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.600
Okay. So you have
two litter boxes for four cats?

11:03.667 --> 11:04.800
-Correct.
-And the three cats

11:04.867 --> 11:06.467
that are outside
only come in sometimes.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.400
That's right.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.300
I gather from reading
the complaint and the answer

11:09.367 --> 11:12.633
that some of this conflict
had to do with your cats.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.066
I imagine it does. Yes.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.400
Yes. I don't want you
to tell me

11:15.467 --> 11:17.533
whether you think
it's true or not.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.200
Whether you believe
that it has validity or not.

11:20.266 --> 11:23.400
I want you to tell me
what Mr. Davoudi's complaint was

11:23.467 --> 11:26.100
about your cats,
because he ultimately confronted you

11:26.166 --> 11:28.633
about the cats,
at some point, I assume,

11:28.700 --> 11:30.300
-after he moved in.
-Yes.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.700
And do you remember when
that conversation took place?

11:32.767 --> 11:33.934
Between the time
that he moved in

11:34.000 --> 11:35.433
and then the 29th.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.367
Okay. What was
the first conversation?

11:37.433 --> 11:38.600
Where did that take place?

11:38.667 --> 11:39.600
Text message.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.066
Okay. I'd like to
see the text message.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.166
So, at some point,
he had your phone number.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.500
Had you given him
your phone number?

11:47.567 --> 11:48.800
Yes. We exchanged
phone numbers.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.266
-When he moved in?
-Yes.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.200
-And that was cordial enough?
-Yes.

11:52.266 --> 11:54.533
-Great.
-We started out very cordial.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.433
I don't have it with me.
It's on my phone.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.900
Sorry.
There's so many papers--

11:59.967 --> 12:01.233
If you can get it
on your phone, I'll look at it.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.600
Whoever gets it to me first,

12:02.667 --> 12:04.367
you can look for it
on your phone.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.066
All right. Here we go.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.567
May I have it, please?

12:14.867 --> 12:16.200
Thank you, Kevin.

12:26.934 --> 12:28.166
I found it, Your Honor.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.200
[sucks teeth] Okay.
This is on November 2nd.

12:32.266 --> 12:33.266
-Okay.
-[Judy] "Hey, Don,"

12:33.333 --> 12:34.600
That would be you.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.467
"Would you please move
the cat food plates containers

12:37.533 --> 12:40.600
to your side in front
instead of our driveway.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.100
By our door.
That we and others walk by."

12:43.166 --> 12:45.500
Sounds like a perfectly
reasonable request.

12:45.567 --> 12:48.033
Those plates
constantly end up by our door

12:48.100 --> 12:49.033
and make a mess.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.800
They attract flies
during the day,

12:50.867 --> 12:54.633
roaches at night, possums have
been coming because of those.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.734
So it's causing
a lot of issues, honestly,

12:56.800 --> 12:58.867
and it's not nice
to look at them.

12:58.934 --> 13:02.266
Then there are those big
nasty cat litter boxes

13:02.333 --> 13:07.166
in front and back of our doors.
Horrendous smell."

13:07.233 --> 13:08.900
Just a second.
Is that correct?

13:08.967 --> 13:10.867
Just the litter,
I mean, feces.

13:10.934 --> 13:12.934
That's what I meant.
Not the boxes. Sorry.

13:13.000 --> 13:13.967
-[Judy] Cat litter?
-[Varlin] Correct.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.967
"In front and back
of our doors,

13:16.033 --> 13:18.000
a horrendous smell it's causing."

13:18.066 --> 13:20.166
-Yes.
-"Everyone that comes over asks

13:20.233 --> 13:22.233
what the horrendous odor is."

13:22.300 --> 13:25.166
And then you say the smell
and where it's coming from.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.367
"It's just embarrassing.

13:26.433 --> 13:28.800
Can't even sit outside
or keep the doors open."

13:28.867 --> 13:29.800
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-"Can't be cleaning

13:29.867 --> 13:32.500
and washing daily,
it's getting too much."

13:32.567 --> 13:35.900
Where's his response?
Where's your response to that?

13:35.967 --> 13:39.133
-That was November 2nd.
-November 2nd.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.500
It's right here.

13:40.567 --> 13:41.734
[Judy] I'd like to see it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.500
Now, you answered him and said,

13:51.567 --> 13:53.900
"I've been doing my best
to keep everybody happy,

13:53.967 --> 13:55.467
but I will keep trying."

13:55.533 --> 13:57.533
Then he said,
"Then the dead rats

13:57.600 --> 14:01.200
they bring all the time.
Sorry, but this is too much.

14:01.266 --> 14:03.667
Can't have my
eighty-year-old widowed mother

14:03.734 --> 14:07.033
clean up after your four cats,
or pick up dead rats

14:07.100 --> 14:08.734
and deal with the flies anymore.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.500
"It's the last thing
that we need.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.734
It's not nice, my man."

14:12.800 --> 14:15.600
"It's made to sound
like I'm doing it on purpose

14:15.667 --> 14:17.934
to just make
everybody else upset.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.767
That's not my nature, Varlin,
you should know that."

14:20.834 --> 14:22.700
And then you respond to him,

14:22.767 --> 14:25.734
"These are your cats
or stray cats you're feeding,

14:25.800 --> 14:27.200
and we're doing
all the cleaning

14:27.266 --> 14:30.934
and dealing with
the flies and dash smell."

14:31.000 --> 14:32.567
And you write,
"They're my cats."

14:32.633 --> 14:35.433
"Then got to clean up
and make them keep clean,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.233
and keep them on your side.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.934
That's what every responsible
pet owner does,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.934
not just feed them
and let them loose

14:42.000 --> 14:44.300
for others to suffer
with the consequences.

14:44.367 --> 14:47.166
That's not fair." Also true.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.700
He'd open his door
and he'd run out

14:49.767 --> 14:51.734
and he'd just yell at 'em
and scream at 'em,

14:51.800 --> 14:53.834
and they'd have to run away
and wouldn't be able to eat.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.500
-[Judy] Okay.
-I've got a video that shows it.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.967
If you've got a video
to show that, Mr. Schulze--

14:58.033 --> 14:59.000
Yes, ma'am.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.100
Why didn't you just
bring the food inside?

15:12.967 --> 15:15.467
[narrator] <i>Defendant</i>
<i>Varlin Davoudi is countersuing</i>

15:15.533 --> 15:16.967
<i>his neighbor, Don Schulze</i>

15:17.033 --> 15:19.266
<i>for an assault</i>
<i>and towing charges.</i>

15:19.333 --> 15:23.200
<i>Don claims he was the one</i>
<i>assaulted by Varlin.</i>

15:23.266 --> 15:25.700
"Now, I have been stupid about putting

15:25.767 --> 15:29.734
more than one plate out there.
I should only put one plate

15:29.800 --> 15:33.967
and then issue it's empty.
I pick up--"

15:34.033 --> 15:37.166
"Sorry, but just
waking up every morning

15:37.233 --> 15:39.633
smelling crap
and looking at dirty plates

15:39.700 --> 15:42.767
and bombarded by flies isn't cool.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.967
Move those so we won't have
to see that and deal with it.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.667
Get the litter cleaned up
every morning if you care.

15:48.734 --> 15:50.033
Thanks again."

15:50.100 --> 15:52.667
"Just four families
that came over yesterday,

15:52.734 --> 15:56.066
and all four said they smell
the same thing, plus others.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.533
It's really embarrassing.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.533
Then they get disgusted
by all the flies

16:00.600 --> 16:02.567
that are here because of you
and your cats.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.100
You know, we are neighbors.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.700
We are supposed to
care for each other."

16:05.767 --> 16:06.700
Mm-mm.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.367
"Have each other's backs,
help each other, be chilled,

16:09.433 --> 16:10.767
just like I've been doing.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.900
Thanks for listening
and moving those

16:12.967 --> 16:14.934
and keeping clean
and moving forward."

16:15.000 --> 16:17.934
And you say, "As far as
putting them on your side,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.200
I'll put them on
the other side of the step.

16:20.266 --> 16:21.900
"That hasn't even occurred to me

16:21.967 --> 16:25.166
because I've been putting them there
for 15 years.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.967
My cats don't bring rats
because they're fed."

16:28.033 --> 16:30.900
By the way, cats
that are outside bring gifts.

16:30.967 --> 16:31.900
[Varlin] Mm-mm.

16:31.967 --> 16:35.800
Many gifts, dead birds,
dead chipmunks, dead rats,

16:35.867 --> 16:37.667
whatever they can find.
That's what they do

16:37.734 --> 16:39.600
when they bring presents
home to their owner.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.233
-He doesn't--
-[Judy] I know, I had cats.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.867
[Varlin] Not his though.

16:42.934 --> 16:47.233
Shh!
We're building bridges here.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.433
Right.
"Which I'm fine with killing the rats.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.667
Cats don't eat them,
they play and they kill them."

16:53.734 --> 16:55.567
Well, you know something
about rats.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.633
"Just that my dad and I
have picked up a few

16:57.700 --> 17:00.600
and seen you passing by
and just leaving it there

17:00.667 --> 17:02.734
for us to pick up.
That's all I'm saying.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.200
My dad not here to pick them up
anymore. Thanks, buddy."

17:06.266 --> 17:07.500
"If I ever see a rat,

17:07.567 --> 17:10.100
I have never once passed it up
without picking it up.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.000
And if I passed it up,
it was because I went

17:12.066 --> 17:13.800
to the back of the house
to get my gloves,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.967
and come back out immediately
and pick it up.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.600
So that was
a misinterpretation.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.000
So I'm not one to
pass a dead animal or rodent

17:20.066 --> 17:21.200
and leave it there.

17:21.266 --> 17:25.000
That's not me. That was
a completely missed.

17:25.066 --> 17:26.767
I picked up a rat
just yesterday

17:26.834 --> 17:28.633
and threw it in the trash.
I thought you knew that

17:28.700 --> 17:30.934
because you were walking around
when I did."

17:31.000 --> 17:33.133
"Oh, I'm sorry. I was supposed
to pick up that one

17:33.200 --> 17:36.467
like the last five months along with
that, hmm, every day."

17:36.533 --> 17:38.333
"I'm not trying
to argue with you.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.867
I'm trying to work with you,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.633
please don't
talk to me like that.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.633
I saw one rat, I picked it up.
Would've seen five rats,

17:44.700 --> 17:46.800
I would've picked up
five rats."

17:46.867 --> 17:48.467
"Okay. Right now,
I'm on the phone

17:48.533 --> 17:50.934
regarding my own father
so when I have more time,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.467
let's talk about it later."

17:52.533 --> 17:54.934
"I will get out there and
start cleaning up the place."

17:55.000 --> 17:56.100
That's you.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.400
And what you're doing, sir,

17:58.467 --> 18:01.934
is leaving these paper plates
out there with food

18:02.000 --> 18:05.100
because I have a photograph
of it, which is not cool.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.166
I pick them up
every-every day.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.333
-It's not-- it's not cool.
-As soon as they finish--

18:08.400 --> 18:10.266
-It's not cool!
-[Don] Okay.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.700
If they're your cats,
feed 'em inside,

18:12.767 --> 18:16.734
then they'll get used to using
a litter box maybe inside.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.934
Then you say to him
at some point,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.200
"Call the police"

18:20.266 --> 18:22.066
because that's what
he's threatened to do.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.867
"Laugh out loud.
Have I threatened you?

18:24.934 --> 18:26.900
Been nothing but
nice and respectful.

18:26.967 --> 18:30.000
Anything you asked
I did right away. Yes or no?"

18:30.066 --> 18:31.300
"But you haven't.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.500
All I asked you was to put
the plates on your front side,

18:34.567 --> 18:37.266
so we don't get awful flies
and roaches and animals,

18:37.333 --> 18:38.867
and get bombarded with flies

18:38.934 --> 18:41.934
every time we pass
into our house.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.433
So it's hard to understand."

18:43.500 --> 18:45.533
"Well, okay.
But I see what you're doing.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.767
And my friend who was visiting
also sees what you're doing.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.000
You approached me
about this yesterday, Varlin.

18:51.066 --> 18:53.467
You haven't given me
a reasonable amount of time

18:53.533 --> 18:54.633
to do anything.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.900
You know my strife
and what I'm going through,

18:56.967 --> 19:00.367
and it's not possible to jump
to your need immediately."

19:00.433 --> 19:02.700
Well, all you had to do
was put the cat food inside.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.700
-I did.
-Mm-mm. Nope.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.066
[Judy] But that took time.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.700
It takes just as much time
to put the cat food outside

19:07.767 --> 19:10.200
as it does to put
the cat food down inside.

19:10.266 --> 19:11.734
My cats couldn't
always come in.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.533
Two of my cats are outdoor only.
So I had to feed them outside,

19:14.600 --> 19:16.200
like I've been doing
for 15 years.

19:16.266 --> 19:17.900
Well, you say
at the beginning of this case,

19:17.967 --> 19:20.700
you said one is inside
all the time,

19:20.767 --> 19:22.967
and the other three
come in and out.

19:23.033 --> 19:24.433
That's what you said
at the beginning.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.467
She's not gonna go back
and read that.

19:25.533 --> 19:26.433
-That's what you said.
-As soon as the cats

19:26.500 --> 19:28.633
are done eating, I brought
the plates in, every time.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.200
I've got a video
that shows that.

19:30.266 --> 19:31.500
[Judy] I'm gonna tell you
something, sir.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.300
Don't put the food outside.

19:33.367 --> 19:34.333
[Don] I'm not anymore.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.533
Okay, good.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.967
"If you do anything
to hurt my cats,

19:37.033 --> 19:38.400
I will call the police."

19:38.467 --> 19:40.300
Did he threaten your cats?
I don't see that here.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.734
His dog chases my cats.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.734
-[Judy] Okay.
-I don't--

19:42.800 --> 19:44.567
I didn't have a dog.
I don't have a dog.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.133
He lets his dog
chase my cats

19:46.200 --> 19:47.333
when they're trying to eat.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.000
Just a second.
What kind of dog?

19:49.066 --> 19:50.934
I don't know. A Labrador
or something like that.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.100
[Varlin] I just got it
two months ago.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.066
He just said back then.
It's my mom's.

19:54.133 --> 19:55.600
It's just a little puppy,
eight weeks old.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.600
Well, this is
back from November.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.800
Right. So he lied again.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.367
Shhh!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.166
I was talking about
the present day.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.967
No, I'm talking
about back here.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.467
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-Back then, he would

20:06.533 --> 20:07.600
[Judy] I'm talking about
back here.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.834
...chase my cats
on foot himself.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.867
[Judy laughs]

20:10.934 --> 20:12.700
He'd chase my cats
away from their food

20:12.767 --> 20:14.000
when they were trying to eat.

20:14.066 --> 20:15.266
He'd open his door
and he'd run out,

20:15.333 --> 20:17.400
and he'd yell at 'em
and scream at 'em

20:17.467 --> 20:19.300
and they'd have to run away
and wouldn't be able to eat.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.767
-[Judy] Okay.
-I've got a video that shows it.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.533
[Judy] Just-- just a sec.
What I'm asking you is,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.400
if you've got a video to show that,

20:25.467 --> 20:26.467
-Mr. Schulze--
-[Don] Yes, ma'am.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.800
[raises voice] Why didn't
you just bring the food inside?

20:28.867 --> 20:30.600
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-I didn't bring the food inside

20:30.667 --> 20:33.367
because the two cats couldn't
come in at that time.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.133
So I had to feed 'em outside.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.266
What do you mean, they
couldn't come in at that time?

20:37.333 --> 20:38.834
-When we started--
-That's what I mean!

20:38.900 --> 20:40.700
They couldn't come in
at that time.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.800
Kevin, would you have a
conversation with the plaintiff

20:42.867 --> 20:44.633
and tell him that there's
only one person

20:44.700 --> 20:46.100
that raises their voice here.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.000
[Varlin] Thank you.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.767
[whispers] You may not wanna
raise your voice at the judge.

20:49.834 --> 20:50.700
Okay.

20:50.767 --> 20:51.734
[Varlin] That's what I deal with.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.300
And I just wanna
let you know that when you--

20:54.367 --> 20:55.333
-I'm already the bad guy here.
-When you display a temper,

20:55.400 --> 20:57.967
when you display--
just a second--

20:58.033 --> 21:00.934
when you display a temper in here,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.333
-I'm trying to help you, sir--
-[sighs] All right.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.900
When you display
a temper in here,

21:05.967 --> 21:09.567
in probably the most
reserved atmosphere...

21:09.633 --> 21:12.667
-Mm-mm.
-...and you can't control yourself

21:12.734 --> 21:15.967
-from displaying a temper...
-That's true. I agree.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.600
...that does not sit well
with the person

21:18.667 --> 21:19.667
-who has to adjudicate.
-I agree.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.467
Just feels like I'm already
being made out to be

21:21.533 --> 21:22.800
-the bad guy here.
-Just a second.

21:22.867 --> 21:25.867
I haven't even gotten to
his side of the story yet.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.800
-All right.
