WEBVTT

00:09.144 --> 00:12.414
Alex: When I was five,
our AC broke.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.217
The house was so hot,
she made Dad

00:14.249 --> 00:17.449
drag a tub under the porch,
where it was cooler.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.197
I was too shy to get into it
because the neighbors

00:19.221 --> 00:21.721
were watching,
so she jumped in first,

00:21.756 --> 00:23.116
to show me that it didn't matter

00:23.158 --> 00:24.628
what anyone else thought,

00:24.659 --> 00:26.759
that the Reids could do
whatever they wanted,

00:26.795 --> 00:28.435
as long as we had each other.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.203
Oh, no, no, no.
These... These have to go.

00:30.232 --> 00:32.332
My mother hated yellow flowers.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.267
Way to go, Jasper.

00:34.303 --> 00:36.103
My little brother sent those?

00:36.138 --> 00:38.268
Yep, still backpacking in Nepal.

00:38.307 --> 00:39.607
Yeah, of course he is.

00:39.641 --> 00:41.441
I bury my troubles
with work, he travels,

00:41.476 --> 00:43.476
and my mother chose
to redecorate.

00:43.512 --> 00:46.512
She did a great job in here.

00:46.548 --> 00:49.278
She did, didn't she?

00:49.318 --> 00:51.348
Is Dougie gonna speak?
I don't know.

00:51.386 --> 00:53.286
I don't know if he's even
gonna show up.

00:53.322 --> 00:56.462
Charlie and Shahir
are taking care of that.

00:56.491 --> 00:59.791
My dad,
my little brother, my mom.

00:59.828 --> 01:03.158
I'm telling you, the Reids
are dropping like flies.

01:11.306 --> 01:12.550
Does the fact that you're going
to get Douglas

01:12.574 --> 01:14.244
mean that you and Alex
are back together?

01:14.276 --> 01:17.746
No. No, it just means that
we're family 'cause of Luke.

01:17.779 --> 01:19.509
Hmm.

01:19.548 --> 01:21.592
Do you always bring your med kit
with you when you travel?

01:21.616 --> 01:23.576
Mm-hmm.
I like to be prepared.

01:23.618 --> 01:25.818
Plus, it holds my snacks.

01:25.854 --> 01:27.464
So tell me about Douglas.

01:27.489 --> 01:28.589
I've never met him.

01:28.623 --> 01:30.363
Uh, well, what can I tell you?

01:30.392 --> 01:34.462
Um, after Alex's father died and
Martha went off the rails,

01:34.496 --> 01:38.196
Dougie kind of became
the man of the house.

01:38.233 --> 01:40.773
That's a lot of responsibility
for a 12-year-old.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.542
Hmm.

01:42.571 --> 01:44.241
Well, Charlie, how...

01:44.273 --> 01:47.443
big do you think he is...
size-wise?

01:47.476 --> 01:49.876
I like to prepare
an adequate dose.

01:49.911 --> 01:51.481
You're gonna drug him?

01:51.513 --> 01:53.483
Alex did say
he wouldn't come easy.

01:55.184 --> 01:57.194
Road trip!

02:00.722 --> 02:02.162
I've crafted the perfect system

02:02.191 --> 02:03.534
for scheduling
the surgical residents.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.188
I can see that
you are very passionate

02:05.227 --> 02:06.527
about your
chief resident duties.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.838
I worked out
eight other versions,

02:07.862 --> 02:08.931
but this is the best one.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.241
Okay, I'm impressed,
Dr. Williams.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.375
Talk me through it.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.400
Okay.
Taking into account...

02:14.436 --> 02:16.266
Hi.
Hey.

02:16.305 --> 02:17.915
Haven't seen you in a while.

02:17.939 --> 02:20.439
I'd heard you've been getting
reacquainted with an old friend.

02:20.475 --> 02:22.745
I've been helping Alex plan
her mother's memorial.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.577
Well, that's the less sexy
version of what I was imagining.

02:26.648 --> 02:27.792
Not imagining imagining, just...

02:27.816 --> 02:29.316
How's Dr. Katz?

02:29.351 --> 02:31.791
I actually don't know.
I've been avoiding her.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.250
I heard she came back for you.

02:33.288 --> 02:34.699
Yeah, I never thought
I'd see her again,

02:34.723 --> 02:36.723
and now she's back,
making declarations.

02:36.758 --> 02:39.658
I just...
I'm still processing.

02:39.694 --> 02:41.864
You better speed it up.
Good morning, Dr. Katz.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.626
Hi. You look lovely
today in those scrubs.

02:43.665 --> 02:45.375
Oh, thank you,
Dr. Miller.

02:46.801 --> 02:47.871
If we move this chunk...

02:47.902 --> 02:49.242
We should probably go.

02:49.271 --> 02:50.741
There's a...

02:50.772 --> 02:52.372
gas leak.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.438
Oh.

02:55.477 --> 02:56.621
Uh, I think
you're in great shape.

02:56.645 --> 02:58.215
Okay.

02:58.247 --> 03:00.407
Um, I just wanted to show you
one more thing...

03:03.585 --> 03:04.995
You're in scrubs.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.749
So everyone keeps pointing out.

03:06.788 --> 03:08.288
Are you working here again?

03:08.323 --> 03:11.563
Mm-hmm. Charlie reinstated
my privileges.

03:11.593 --> 03:13.993
So are you sticking around
or what...

03:14.028 --> 03:15.758
Maggie, I don't want to make
small talk.

03:15.797 --> 03:18.227
I told you how I felt, and I
haven't heard from you since.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.278
I've been working doubles,
and there was the cremation

03:20.302 --> 03:21.572
and now the memorial and...

03:21.603 --> 03:22.880
The last thing I want
is to complicate

03:22.904 --> 03:24.374
your life any further.

03:24.406 --> 03:25.966
So I'll see you later.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.537
Syd, it's...

03:28.577 --> 03:31.247
Woman on P.A.: Assistance
in 14, bed two.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.480
Assistance in 16, bed four.

03:38.620 --> 03:41.560
Maggie, My mom's urn
got held up at customs.

03:41.590 --> 03:43.590
I ordered it on Etsy,
custom-made out of oak,

03:43.625 --> 03:45.436
just like the tree from her back yard.
Alex, slow down.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.372
I need you to help me
get it back before the memorial.

03:47.396 --> 03:48.856
Where is Martha now?

03:50.332 --> 03:51.709
I didn't know
where else to put her.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.278
I mean, she just brought these
cute little rain boots

03:53.302 --> 03:54.672
for Luke, and they were...

03:54.703 --> 03:56.873
So, actually, this is the last
thing that she...

03:56.905 --> 03:58.945
I'll handle it. Just do you have
a tracking number?

03:58.973 --> 04:01.313
I will e-mail you it.

04:01.343 --> 04:02.513
I have to go
to the E.R.

04:02.544 --> 04:03.654
Here. Just keep her
with you,

04:03.678 --> 04:04.822
I don't want her to be alone.

04:04.846 --> 04:07.646
You are a godsend, Maggie.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.616
Oh, Dr. Reid.

04:13.655 --> 04:14.825
Oh.

04:14.856 --> 04:16.416
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.757
I hope she didn't suffer.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.036
I can't believe you're back
to work so soon.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.790
If my mother died,
I don't know, I'd be...

04:20.829 --> 04:22.840
Dr. Williams, I'm just trying
to get through the day.

04:22.864 --> 04:25.574
So if we can keep this
as professional as possible...

04:25.600 --> 04:26.900
Yes, of course.

04:26.935 --> 04:29.045
The new surgical schedule
is out.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.315
I'm with
Dr. Scott.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.571
Oh, is that a problem?

04:33.608 --> 04:34.785
He's kind of chatty,
and I wanted to be alone

04:34.809 --> 04:35.939
with my thoughts today.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.377
Oh, yeah, I totally get that,

04:37.412 --> 04:38.852
but I can't switch
the assignment.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.780
It's a house of cards,
and my system is flawless.

04:42.817 --> 04:44.487
Lovely.

04:44.519 --> 04:46.096
Oh, and, Jackson, don't forget
to take his tongue ring out

04:46.120 --> 04:47.460
before you stick him in the MRI.

04:47.489 --> 04:48.719
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

04:48.757 --> 04:50.067
It will split
his tongue in half...

04:50.091 --> 04:52.461
look like a tiny burrito
exploded in a microwave.

04:52.494 --> 04:53.734
Yeah.

04:53.762 --> 04:55.502
Hey, Zach, what's up?

04:55.530 --> 04:57.600
Alex, I heard about your mom.

04:57.632 --> 04:58.632
Just wanted to say...

04:58.667 --> 04:59.697
It... It...
It's fine.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.404
I'm fine.

05:01.436 --> 05:03.047
Honestly, Zach, just raise
a glass to her tonight,

05:03.071 --> 05:04.882
celebrate her life... That's
what she would have wanted.

05:04.906 --> 05:06.106
That I can do.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.340
But if there's anything else
at all...

05:08.377 --> 05:09.637
Who's your resident today?

05:09.678 --> 05:11.548
I've got Brown Clooney.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.050
What? He calls me White Denzel.

05:13.081 --> 05:14.111
It's a thing.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.878
Well, trade me for Billy.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.647
That's like trading a race horse
for a llama with bangs.

05:18.687 --> 05:19.764
You said anything.

05:19.788 --> 05:21.618
No, not that.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.786
Paramedic: Erin Avery, 16,
short breaths,

05:23.825 --> 05:25.002
swollen extremities, back pain.

05:25.026 --> 05:27.026
Okay, let's get her to bed four.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.601
Sekara, Katrina?

05:28.630 --> 05:30.060
You're in the hospital now,
Erin.

05:30.098 --> 05:31.368
You're gonna be fine, okay?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.577
Alex: Honey,
you need to hang back

05:32.601 --> 05:34.001
and let the doctors work,
all right?

05:34.035 --> 05:35.813
Erin was diagnosed with
polycystic kidney disease

05:35.837 --> 05:37.515
at three and a half,
but she's been receiving

05:37.539 --> 05:39.639
biweekly dialysis treatments
for the past six months.

05:39.674 --> 05:40.851
But lately it's gotten
much worse.

05:40.875 --> 05:44.085
Okay, on three.
One, two, three.

05:44.112 --> 05:46.112
Is she on
the kidney transplant list?

05:46.147 --> 05:47.647
She doesn't need to be.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.882
Her little sister is a match.

05:49.918 --> 05:52.488
She's getting one
of Vicky's kidneys.

05:55.056 --> 05:58.086
Captions by VITAC...

06:04.766 --> 06:06.511
All right, somebody's
gonna stay with her, right?

06:06.535 --> 06:08.505
B-Because dialysis
carries some risks.

06:08.537 --> 06:11.637
I mean, there's hypertension
or stroke or... or arrhythmia.

06:11.673 --> 06:14.883
Dad, he's a doctor.
He knows.

06:14.909 --> 06:17.749
She's in good hands,
Mr. Avery.

06:17.779 --> 06:19.509
Where are you going with
Dr. Reid's patient?

06:19.548 --> 06:22.148
Where's Billy? Dr. Miller and Dr.
Reid traded.

06:22.183 --> 06:25.623
What?! No!
They can't do that!

06:26.921 --> 06:29.421
It covers 11 years of Erin's
medical records...

06:29.458 --> 06:30.718
every test, every scan.

06:30.759 --> 06:31.989
It looks like it's been

06:32.026 --> 06:33.856
meticulously sorted
and color-coded.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.905
Wow.
Unbelievable.

06:36.931 --> 06:38.171
Oh, my God.

06:38.199 --> 06:39.169
What is it?

06:39.200 --> 06:40.770
Vicky's file.

06:40.802 --> 06:42.602
It looks like
they tested her in utero

06:42.637 --> 06:43.867
to see if she was a match.

06:43.905 --> 06:45.515
She's a savior sibling?

06:45.540 --> 06:46.840
Looks like it.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.115
What's a savior sibling?

06:49.143 --> 06:51.913
Vicky was conceived
to be an organ donor

06:51.946 --> 06:54.916
for her older sister.

06:54.949 --> 06:57.589
I can't do the transplant.
It's unethical.

06:59.821 --> 07:01.921
Where are you?

07:01.956 --> 07:03.456
I have to...

07:03.492 --> 07:04.992
Uh...

07:05.026 --> 07:06.486
Hmm.

07:08.229 --> 07:10.199
Ugh! Syd?!
I need you!

07:10.231 --> 07:11.571
Sorry, Maggie, I can't.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.770
I lost Martha!
I had her ashes!

07:13.802 --> 07:15.502
They were in a shoe box,
I put her down

07:15.537 --> 07:17.114
for two seconds... Max. Two seconds!

07:17.138 --> 07:18.938
What?
Damn it.

07:18.973 --> 07:20.143
I have a consult.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.644
I know the last thing
you want to do

07:21.676 --> 07:23.187
is help me right now,
after everything...

07:23.211 --> 07:24.955
Fine, go to your patient.
I'll take over the search.

07:24.979 --> 07:27.919
You're looking for a small,
red children's shoe box.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.719
Got it.
Thank you!

07:30.752 --> 07:32.852
Hey, chocolate milk...

07:34.789 --> 07:37.019
Dr. Katz
is in the house.

07:41.062 --> 07:42.802
Hi, Olivia,
I'm Dr. Lin.

07:42.831 --> 07:44.501
I'm Jesse, her fiancé.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.010
Olivia had terrible
stomach pains all night.

07:46.034 --> 07:47.944
Okay, were you vomiting at all?

07:47.969 --> 07:49.599
Can you show me where it hurts?

07:51.540 --> 07:54.740
Does it hurt right here?

07:54.776 --> 07:56.276
No.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.950
Okay, I'm gonna send you up
for some scans just to rule out

07:58.980 --> 08:01.110
appendicitis... just better
to be safe than sorry.

08:01.149 --> 08:02.679
Can you get me a bottle
of water?

08:02.717 --> 08:05.987
Yeah, of course, babe.
I'll be right back.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.220
Okay, let's cut to the chase,
it's not appendicitis.

08:08.256 --> 08:09.916
It burns when I pee.

08:11.626 --> 08:13.956
We all know the risks
of live donation.

08:13.995 --> 08:15.865
The girls have talked
to doctors and counselors

08:15.897 --> 08:17.927
and to each other.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.109
Vicky, do you think
we could talk,

08:19.133 --> 08:20.533
just the two of us for a minute?

08:20.569 --> 08:21.979
Anything you need to say
to my daughter

08:22.003 --> 08:23.743
you can say in front of me.

08:23.772 --> 08:25.650
Well, Vicky, because you're
under the age of consent,

08:25.674 --> 08:28.744
the transplant will need to be
approved by our ethicist.

08:30.645 --> 08:31.785
You okay?

08:31.813 --> 08:33.553
I get emotional
when Erin's sick.

08:33.582 --> 08:35.722
Of course. Can we move
this along, please?

08:35.750 --> 08:37.620
I will take you
to Erin's room the minute

08:37.652 --> 08:40.022
they finish setting up
her dialysis.

08:40.054 --> 08:42.764
Then we'll discuss
the next steps.

08:42.791 --> 08:44.631
Okay.

08:45.694 --> 08:46.764
Charlie?

08:46.795 --> 08:48.205
Yeah?

08:48.229 --> 08:50.829
Um, I'd like to ask you
as interim chief of surgery...

08:50.865 --> 08:53.575
Shahir, you don't have to say
"interim" chief every time.

08:53.602 --> 08:55.642
Right. Well, I need you
to reduce my hours.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.870
What? I don't have a budget
for another neuro.

08:57.906 --> 08:59.566
You have to.

08:59.608 --> 09:02.108
Jonathan and I
are adopting a baby.

09:02.143 --> 09:04.313
Shahir, congratulations, man.

09:04.345 --> 09:06.885
That's great. I'm... I'm happy
for you guys.

09:06.915 --> 09:08.195
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, it's very...

09:10.985 --> 09:12.795
Exciting.

09:12.821 --> 09:14.051
Hmm.

09:14.088 --> 09:17.688
Well, I guess we don't need
to drug him.

09:17.726 --> 09:19.886
Want to grab his feet?

09:19.928 --> 09:22.058
Okay.

09:25.199 --> 09:27.369
Hey, Doug.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.801
What's going on?

09:29.838 --> 09:31.738
Oh. Hey, buddy.

09:31.773 --> 09:33.173
Long time, no see.

09:33.207 --> 09:34.267
Oh.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.378
Hi. I'm
Dr. Shahir Hamza.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.880
Hey, Doc, I really think
I'm gonna Ralph.

09:38.913 --> 09:40.013
Okay, let's put him down.

09:40.048 --> 09:41.818
Put him down.
Oh, right.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.010
Put him down, put him down,
put him down, put him down.

09:46.888 --> 09:49.199
I've checked the ward, the
nurse's station, and the lounge.

09:49.223 --> 09:50.968
Nothing yet, but there's still
lots of places to look.

09:50.992 --> 09:52.232
Like where, the City Morgue?

09:52.260 --> 09:54.390
Have a little faith in me.
I'll find it.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.206
Sweetie, I hate to ask,
but I really feel like

09:56.230 --> 09:58.100
something to eat now, too.

09:58.132 --> 09:59.872
Sorry to be a pain.

09:59.901 --> 10:03.141
No, it's like practice... for
when we get pregnant, you know.

10:03.171 --> 10:05.941
Getting you bacon
and ice cream at 2:00 a.m.

10:05.974 --> 10:07.174
Either of you have kids?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.178
Do you want 'em?

10:08.209 --> 10:09.839
I do.
Yes.

10:09.878 --> 10:11.088
You remember the deli we passed
on the way here?

10:11.112 --> 10:13.082
Two blocks south
on the west side?

10:13.114 --> 10:15.924
One corned beef sandwich,
coming up.

10:18.953 --> 10:20.130
Please tell me it's good news.

10:20.154 --> 10:21.694
I'm afraid not, Olivia.

10:21.723 --> 10:23.893
You tested positive
for chlamydia,

10:23.925 --> 10:26.265
which means that Jesse
should probably be tested, too.

10:26.294 --> 10:28.104
Oh.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.099
No.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.160
No, he's fine.

10:30.198 --> 10:33.998
We... We haven't had
sex yet.

10:34.035 --> 10:35.675
He just got out of jail.

10:35.704 --> 10:37.204
Not for, like, murder
or anything...

10:37.238 --> 10:38.808
For smuggling iguanas
from Brazil.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.110
Iguanas?

10:40.141 --> 10:41.251
Yeah, he used to be
a reptile wrangler

10:41.275 --> 10:42.385
for kids' birthday parties.

10:42.410 --> 10:44.680
Oh, he's a lizard wizard.

10:44.713 --> 10:46.813
Totally.
See, she gets it.

10:46.848 --> 10:49.078
Anyway, we went online
and, um...

10:49.117 --> 10:51.317
we wrote everyday,
and all of a sudden,

10:51.352 --> 10:53.252
I realized we were in love,
and then suddenly,

10:53.287 --> 10:54.757
we're getting married.

10:54.789 --> 10:58.929
And before he was being
released, I...

10:58.960 --> 11:01.130
I had
a one-night stand.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.073
Well, you felt like things
were moving too quickly,

11:03.097 --> 11:04.767
and you panicked.
It's understandable.

11:04.799 --> 11:06.276
Well, sometimes when you meet
the right person,

11:06.300 --> 11:08.940
things just happen
quickly naturally.

11:10.004 --> 11:11.344
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:11.372 --> 11:13.142
Dr. Katz.
I'm an obstetrician.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.984
Okay, why do I need
an obstetrician?

11:15.009 --> 11:16.921
Because chlamydia can spread
into the reproductive system,

11:16.945 --> 11:19.355
and if that happens,
there can be complications.

11:19.380 --> 11:22.420
What kind of complications,
like, worst-case scenario?

11:22.450 --> 11:25.420
Worst-case scenario,
infertility.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.993
But Jesse and I
want to start a family.

11:29.791 --> 11:33.061
Saira: You're suggesting
she's been coerced.

11:33.094 --> 11:35.334
Look, she grew up in a house
with a sister who was sick

11:35.363 --> 11:37.333
all the time, being told
that she's the answer

11:37.365 --> 11:39.405
to Erin's pain and suffering.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.433
Maybe she feels like
she has to do this.

11:41.469 --> 11:43.169
Let's hear what she has to say.

11:43.204 --> 11:44.874
Okay.

11:48.843 --> 11:50.483
Hi, Vicky.
I'm Saira Clemmons.

11:50.511 --> 11:53.211
Hi.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.077
I'd like us to get to know
each other a bit.

11:55.116 --> 11:56.376
Is that cool?
Mm-hmm.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.847
All right, I'll go first.

11:57.886 --> 12:00.316
Um, I have an older brother
named Amir.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.964
And I kind of grew up
all over the place,

12:01.990 --> 12:04.160
but mostly in Thunder Bay.

12:04.192 --> 12:05.892
I'm Alex.

12:05.927 --> 12:09.097
I have three brothers...
two younger and one older,

12:09.130 --> 12:10.330
named Dougie.

12:10.364 --> 12:12.834
And we grew up in
St. Catherine's.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.444
Can you tell us a little bit
about yourself?

12:14.468 --> 12:16.398
Can I please have a tissue?

12:16.437 --> 12:17.767
Sure.

12:22.911 --> 12:25.251
I wrote something.
Is that okay?

12:25.279 --> 12:26.849
Absolutely.

12:30.118 --> 12:32.848
"My sister doesn't think
I'm lame or annoying,

12:32.887 --> 12:34.887
like most older sisters do.

12:34.923 --> 12:37.863
I love Erin, even though
we never get to do fun things

12:37.892 --> 12:40.132
like play sports
or go on vacation.

12:40.161 --> 12:42.801
One time, Erin didn't get sick
for two months

12:42.831 --> 12:44.401
and we were like
a normal family.

12:44.432 --> 12:46.932
We even talked about
going to Wonder Land.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.368
Then she fainted in the shower

12:48.402 --> 12:51.072
and we never talked
about it again.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.415
I just want Erin
to have a normal life."

12:55.076 --> 12:56.536
Am I allowed to ask questions?

12:56.577 --> 13:00.807
Whatever you want to say will
help me make my decision.

13:00.849 --> 13:04.279
I guess the one thing I really
want to know, from you, Alex,

13:04.318 --> 13:06.548
what does saving a life
feel like?

13:08.322 --> 13:11.162
Feels kind of awesome.

13:11.192 --> 13:12.336
I bet it would feel even better

13:12.360 --> 13:15.600
if it was Dougie's life
you saved.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.099
May I please go to the bathroom?

13:18.132 --> 13:19.472
Of course.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.978
I think I've heard everything
I need to hear.

13:21.002 --> 13:23.842
It's down the hall,
on your right.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:32.446 --> 13:35.016
Dr. Sekara, you've got to see
this video from my birthday.

13:35.049 --> 13:36.193
You said you wanted
a beach theme,

13:36.217 --> 13:37.494
and that's exactly what you got.

13:37.518 --> 13:39.088
And I don't care
what anybody says,

13:39.120 --> 13:40.560
I think I look fierce
in that bikini.

13:40.588 --> 13:42.088
Vicky laughed so hard, I thought

13:42.123 --> 13:43.463
she was gonna fall
into the pool.

13:45.026 --> 13:46.386
Sorry to interrupt.

13:46.427 --> 13:48.397
I just wanted to let you know
that the ethicist

13:48.429 --> 13:50.459
has made her decision.

13:50.498 --> 13:52.198
How did it go?
Did Vicky convince you?

13:52.233 --> 13:54.103
Well, she is a very intelligent
young lady.

13:54.135 --> 13:55.875
And what is the decision?

13:55.904 --> 13:58.574
Vicky can decide for herself
how she'd like to proceed.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.371
So you will do the transplant?

14:01.409 --> 14:03.079
If that's what Vicky wants, yes.

14:03.111 --> 14:04.641
Where is V?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.056
You know what?
She probably got lost

14:06.080 --> 14:07.480
coming back from the bathroom.

14:07.515 --> 14:09.985
I will go find her
and tell her the good news.

14:10.018 --> 14:11.578
Dr. Sekara.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.460
Vicky?

14:20.494 --> 14:22.634
I'll be right out.

14:22.663 --> 14:25.133
Is everything okay?

14:28.569 --> 14:30.999
Hey!
Oh, what happened?

14:31.039 --> 14:32.109
Hey.

14:32.140 --> 14:33.410
Nothing.
I'm fine.

14:33.441 --> 14:35.481
Oh, my God, you are burning up.

14:35.509 --> 14:36.639
Okay, all right.

14:36.677 --> 14:39.107
It's okay, honey.

14:39.147 --> 14:40.507
You okay?

14:40.548 --> 14:42.548
Please don't tell my parents.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.393
I'm supposed to be
the strong one.

14:45.419 --> 14:48.389
I know, sweetie, I know.

14:48.422 --> 14:51.292
Everything is gonna be okay.

14:56.397 --> 14:58.167
I should tell him, shouldn't I?

14:58.199 --> 14:59.329
Not necessarily.

14:59.367 --> 15:00.527
Yes, he's your fiancé.

15:00.568 --> 15:02.368
Well, you're not
sexually active yet,

15:02.403 --> 15:04.243
so it's technically
not his business.

15:04.272 --> 15:06.312
Hmm, Dr. Lin, could you slide
the wand back over

15:06.340 --> 15:08.210
the left Fallopian tube?

15:09.277 --> 15:10.607
What is it?

15:10.644 --> 15:12.714
This gray spot here
looks like an abscess

15:12.746 --> 15:14.676
caused by the bacteria
from your STI.

15:14.715 --> 15:16.155
Does that mean
I can't have babies?

15:16.184 --> 15:17.661
No, no, it's just
a blockage right now.

15:17.685 --> 15:20.055
We can drain it and clear
the tube with a minor procedure.

15:20.088 --> 15:21.218
I have to have surgery?!

15:21.255 --> 15:24.365
It's minimally invasive,
but, yes.

15:24.392 --> 15:26.703
No, I can't go into surgery
without telling Jesse the truth.

15:26.727 --> 15:29.357
The truth about what?

15:29.397 --> 15:31.927
We'll give you two some space.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.610
Is your arm acting up?

15:40.641 --> 15:43.281
I can write a prescription
when we get back.

15:43.311 --> 15:46.381
Dougie: Hey, can I get in
on that action?

15:46.414 --> 15:48.524
You're fine
with the saline, Doug.

15:48.549 --> 15:50.249
I'm always prepared.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.524
You know, chuckles,
if you weren't such a good guy,

15:52.553 --> 15:54.323
I'd kick your ass
for kidnapping me.

15:54.355 --> 15:56.365
You're mad at Alex.
She's mad at you.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.620
You'll work it out.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.358
What does she
have to be mad about?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.393
Uh, I guess you'll find out
when you see her.

16:01.429 --> 16:03.059
You have to make amends
with your sister.

16:03.097 --> 16:05.397
Otherwise, the whole Reid family
structure will crumble.

16:05.433 --> 16:08.003
You got a good relationship
with your family?

16:08.036 --> 16:09.166
Yes.

16:09.203 --> 16:10.573
Well...

16:10.604 --> 16:12.314
Until recently.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.770
Oh, yeah?
What happened?

16:14.808 --> 16:17.608
I'm adopting a child
with my partner, Jonathan.

16:17.645 --> 16:20.215
But my parents don't approve.

16:20.248 --> 16:23.118
You're gay.
Yes.

16:23.151 --> 16:25.491
Well, screw 'em.

16:25.519 --> 16:27.889
Your kid's lucky
he's not gonna have a mom.

16:31.759 --> 16:34.029
Billy, what are you doing here?

16:34.062 --> 16:35.772
Okay, so you know how you
assigned me to Dr. Reid

16:35.796 --> 16:37.426
and then she traded me
to Dr. Miller?

16:37.465 --> 16:39.475
Yes. Well, Dr. Katz
commandeered me.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.770
Does she even work here?

16:42.270 --> 16:43.713
The whole thing
could just be some weird

16:43.737 --> 16:48.077
lesbian mating ritual between
her and Dr. Lin, which...

16:48.109 --> 16:50.039
I'm totally down with.

16:50.078 --> 16:51.388
Dr. Williams,
there were no residents

16:51.412 --> 16:52.489
assigned to my rhinoplasty.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.653
Do you know why?

16:53.681 --> 16:55.621
I-I-I'm so sorry,
Dr. Storms.

16:55.649 --> 16:57.549
There was a little horse
trading, and, clearly,

16:57.585 --> 16:59.625
the schedule's been affected.

16:59.653 --> 17:02.163
Get your act together, Williams.

17:02.190 --> 17:04.220
I'm handling it.

17:04.258 --> 17:05.258
I'm handling it.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.328
Well, Olivia came clean
about her one-night stand,

17:09.363 --> 17:10.663
and Jesse walked out on her.

17:10.698 --> 17:12.268
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.369
But being honest
was the right thing to do.

17:14.402 --> 17:15.801
We should scrub.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.396
Maybe for you, but...

17:17.438 --> 17:19.249
people deal with their issues
in different ways.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.443
Like, say,
turning their phones off?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.145
I thought we wanted
the same thing.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.707
So did I. Then
what's the problem?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.255
I don't know.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.710
I'm so happy you're back.

17:27.748 --> 17:29.778
It's just ever since
you told me how you felt

17:29.817 --> 17:33.147
and you kissed me, I've been
fighting this feeling...

17:33.187 --> 17:36.257
almost like I'm being
strangled from the inside.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.334
That's how I make you feel?

17:37.358 --> 17:39.088
No, I'm not being clear.

17:39.127 --> 17:40.270
No, that's the clearest
you've been since I got here.

17:40.294 --> 17:41.664
No, it's not.
I'm...

17:41.695 --> 17:43.365
This is why
I've been avoiding you.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.797
I'm just... I'm still
processing.

17:44.832 --> 17:46.172
Okay, great.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.740
You process.
I'm gonna scrub in.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.870
Hey, I...
I should come back.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.745
Did you find Martha?

17:53.774 --> 17:55.814
Nada. It is adios muchacho
to that bag of ashes.

17:55.843 --> 17:57.183
Dr. Scott,
you weren't supposed

17:57.211 --> 17:58.581
to be looking
for a bag of ashes.

17:58.612 --> 17:59.889
You're supposed to be looking
for a red shoe box

17:59.913 --> 18:02.253
with ashes in it.

18:02.283 --> 18:03.453
Well, this changes things.

18:03.484 --> 18:06.124
Keep looking!

18:12.693 --> 18:14.763
The symptoms suggest that
Vicky's caught a virus

18:14.795 --> 18:16.435
and that it's become
quite severe.

18:16.464 --> 18:19.174
Oh, she... didn't even know
she was sick.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.570
What kind of parents are we?

18:20.601 --> 18:22.241
Vicky's always been so strong.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.181
Doctor, we... you need to know
that we didn't have Vicky

18:24.205 --> 18:25.875
just to save Erin's life.

18:25.906 --> 18:28.206
But when you have
a three-year-old who's so sick

18:28.242 --> 18:30.512
she can barely open her eyes
and the doctor

18:30.544 --> 18:32.884
tells you eventually she's gonna
need a kidney transplant

18:32.913 --> 18:36.423
and that a related donor
is the best option...

18:36.450 --> 18:39.350
Well, we always wanted a second child.
Of course.

18:39.387 --> 18:42.587
But you should know that until
Vicky's 100% healthy,

18:42.623 --> 18:44.893
she won't be eligible to donate.
Yes, of course.

18:44.925 --> 18:47.735
We... We just want both
of our daughters to be healthy.

18:47.761 --> 18:49.461
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

18:49.497 --> 18:53.327
Dr. Reid, we need
to speak with you.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.597
I'll see you in a moment.

18:58.406 --> 19:00.236
As soon as Vicky's chest CT
came back,

19:00.274 --> 19:01.285
I knew there was a problem.

19:01.309 --> 19:02.409
So you paged Dr. Bell?

19:02.443 --> 19:05.213
No, he paged me because of this.

19:05.246 --> 19:07.557
What? She's been scanned head
to toe every day of her life.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.592
How did somebody miss this?

19:08.616 --> 19:10.216
I guess it's new.

19:21.562 --> 19:23.562
It's called viral myocarditis.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.327
The heart will continue
to get weaker

19:25.366 --> 19:27.466
until it can no longer pump
on its own.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.671
Can you fix it or...
or reverse the effects?

19:30.704 --> 19:33.444
We can surgically
implant a device.

19:33.474 --> 19:36.244
It's called an LVAD.

19:36.277 --> 19:38.247
That is a pump
that helps the heart

19:38.279 --> 19:39.756
move the blood
through the rest of the body.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.850
Yeah, and...
and that will fix her?

19:41.882 --> 19:43.452
It's not a cure.

19:43.484 --> 19:44.928
But it will help her
to remain healthy

19:44.952 --> 19:46.652
for a little while longer.

19:46.687 --> 19:50.357
With some luck, Vicky's heart
could heal on its own.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.489
What if it doesn't?

19:54.695 --> 19:57.735
She'll need a heart transplant.

19:57.765 --> 19:59.675
Look, I know that this
is a lot to process,

19:59.700 --> 20:01.570
but the sooner we get Vicky
into the O.R.,

20:01.602 --> 20:02.702
the better her chances.

20:02.736 --> 20:04.936
Please, just save our baby.

20:04.972 --> 20:07.542
We'll do what we can.

20:07.575 --> 20:09.785
Excuse us.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.277
Okay, so we'll put her
on pump first

20:15.316 --> 20:16.846
and then we'll do
the implantation.

20:18.286 --> 20:19.346
Is there something wrong?

20:19.387 --> 20:20.687
It's a family thing.

20:20.721 --> 20:21.998
It's gonna be a while
before I need you.

20:22.022 --> 20:23.392
Happy to pinch-hit
in the meantime.

20:23.424 --> 20:25.024
Thank you.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.271
Dr. Bell, I've already assisted
on a few LVAD insertions.

20:27.295 --> 20:28.672
Maybe I could take the lead
on this one.

20:28.696 --> 20:30.026
Maybe.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.675
Actually, Dr. Bell,
I'll be assisting you.

20:31.699 --> 20:34.569
Dr. Sekara
has been reassigned.

20:34.602 --> 20:37.272
Okay, well, you two duke it out,
and whoever wins,

20:37.305 --> 20:39.415
just meet me inside.

20:41.409 --> 20:42.879
You're poaching my surgery?

20:42.910 --> 20:45.280
If everyone's going to disregard
my schedule, then so am I.

20:45.313 --> 20:47.713
Wow. Okay, so that's how
we're doing things?

20:47.748 --> 20:49.348
I tried to play nice.

20:49.383 --> 20:52.753
Remember this tomorrow
when the new schedule comes out.

21:03.431 --> 21:05.901
Just come inside
and talk to her.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.033
She deserves that much.

21:08.068 --> 21:10.868
Even after everything,
you're still beside her,

21:10.904 --> 21:13.374
backing her up.

21:13.407 --> 21:15.707
Yep, I am.

21:15.743 --> 21:19.353
Honey Nut Shahirios,
can I offer some advice?

21:19.380 --> 21:21.080
If things go south
with your family,

21:21.114 --> 21:24.084
make sure your kid knows
it's not their fault.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.047
Okay.

21:26.086 --> 21:28.516
Dougie?

21:28.556 --> 21:30.886
Well, I'll see you inside.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.832
Those two...

21:36.864 --> 21:39.534
You got a lot of good guys
in your corner.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.827
I miss having you in my corner.

21:40.868 --> 21:42.468
Oh, yeah.

21:42.503 --> 21:44.103
St. Alex.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.367
I'm not a saint.

21:45.406 --> 21:46.966
Yeah, explain it to me, then.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.837
Dad hangs himself
on your birthday

21:48.876 --> 21:50.576
and Mom downs a bottle of meds,

21:50.611 --> 21:53.781
and here you are,
your halo still shining.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.424
I don't want to fight with you.

21:55.449 --> 21:56.519
Maybe I want a fight.

21:56.550 --> 21:57.720
What would be the point?

21:57.751 --> 21:59.551
It'd be honest, for one thing.

21:59.587 --> 22:01.917
Lord knows we're short
on honesty in this family,

22:01.955 --> 22:03.895
which is why we make
such good drunks.

22:03.924 --> 22:05.934
And you'd know everything
about that, wouldn't you?

22:05.959 --> 22:08.137
You know, you're too busy
at the pub to help me with Mom,

22:08.161 --> 22:09.506
you're too busy running away
from all your problems

22:09.530 --> 22:10.700
to pick up the phone.

22:10.731 --> 22:13.831
I'm not the one who let her die.

22:13.867 --> 22:15.397
"Let her die"?

22:15.436 --> 22:16.966
Yeah. You're saying
I let her die?

22:17.004 --> 22:18.574
You were right there.

22:18.606 --> 22:20.966
Why didn't you try to do
something to save her? Huh?

22:21.008 --> 22:23.378
You know what, Dougie,
you have no idea what happened,

22:23.411 --> 22:25.811
because...
you weren't there.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.076
Because you're never there.

22:27.114 --> 22:29.624
Ever!
Yeah.

22:29.650 --> 22:33.520
That's right.
So why change that now?

22:44.532 --> 22:46.032
Never get tired of seeing that.

22:46.066 --> 22:47.866
Great. Stitching the LVAD
into the ventricle.

22:47.901 --> 22:49.041
Get ready on the suction.

22:49.069 --> 22:51.539
Scalpel.
Roxy, what are you doing?

22:51.572 --> 22:54.042
Lining up my protection stones.
Is there a problem?

22:54.074 --> 22:56.984
No. Just thought
you were a doctor.

23:01.949 --> 23:04.649
Hey.
Everything okay?

23:04.685 --> 23:05.995
Of course.
Absolutely.

23:06.019 --> 23:07.519
Okay, we're about
to graft the inflow.

23:07.555 --> 23:09.025
Jump in.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.935
Well, the, uh, break seems
to be setting nicely, Marvin.

23:14.962 --> 23:16.132
That's awesome.

23:16.163 --> 23:17.603
Can I help you?

23:17.631 --> 23:19.431
Oh, no, you've already done
so much.

23:19.467 --> 23:20.697
Oh, uh, take him up

23:20.734 --> 23:22.674
to the fracture clinic
for me, would you?

23:22.703 --> 23:24.543
Thank you.

23:24.572 --> 23:26.542
Hi. I'm looking for
my sister, Erin.

23:26.574 --> 23:27.874
She was getting dialysis.

23:27.908 --> 23:30.978
Okay, and do you know
you're a ghost?

23:31.011 --> 23:32.751
I really need to find Erin.

23:32.780 --> 23:36.680
Okay. Well, dialysis
is this way, so follow me.

23:36.717 --> 23:38.887
That's my sister.

23:44.725 --> 23:46.135
Dev: Dr. Reid?
What is it?

23:46.159 --> 23:48.159
It's Vicky's sister.
She had a stroke.

23:48.195 --> 23:50.735
Shahir thinks it was caused
by the heparin in her dialyzer.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.975
Roxy: You've got to
be kidding me.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.569
This family can't buy a break.

23:53.601 --> 23:55.571
Where is she?

23:55.603 --> 23:58.043
With Dr. Hamza
in O.R. 2.

24:02.009 --> 24:04.209
Excuse me.

24:04.244 --> 24:05.984
Dawn: Okay, the sewing cup
is in place.

24:07.981 --> 24:10.181
Where's Erin?

24:10.217 --> 24:11.547
Is she in one of these rooms?

24:11.585 --> 24:12.925
Yeah, but, uh...

24:12.953 --> 24:14.764
kind of got to let the doctors
do their job, right?

24:14.788 --> 24:16.258
I just want to know
that she's okay.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.159
Okay.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.592
Hey, what's going on, Charlie?

24:20.628 --> 24:22.998
Um, I was just talking to Vicky.

24:23.030 --> 24:24.130
Just talking to her?

24:24.164 --> 24:25.734
Just talking to her.

24:25.766 --> 24:26.843
Well, that's not
a good sign, is it?

24:26.867 --> 24:29.137
No, I would assume not.

24:29.169 --> 24:31.239
You haven't seen her sister
around, have you?

24:31.271 --> 24:33.149
No, why? Because these girls
are hanging by a thread.

24:33.173 --> 24:34.713
I've got one whose kidney
is shot,

24:34.742 --> 24:36.119
and the other one's heart
is failing her.

24:36.143 --> 24:37.521
And if they don't
wake up soon, it's just...

24:37.545 --> 24:40.855
Okay, okay.
I'll do what I can.

24:40.881 --> 24:43.881
Great.
Thank you.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.294
Well, you heard
the nice lady doctor.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.896
Let's get you back
inside your body, right?

24:46.920 --> 24:49.120
Vee?
Erin!

24:49.156 --> 24:50.256
You won't believe it!

24:50.290 --> 24:51.590
I finally feel better!

24:51.625 --> 24:53.295
Come on!

24:54.327 --> 24:56.557
Charlie?
What's wrong?

24:56.597 --> 24:58.767
Um...

24:58.799 --> 25:01.069
Nothing I can't handle.

25:07.140 --> 25:08.780
Port sights look good.

25:08.809 --> 25:10.139
How are you feeling?

25:10.177 --> 25:11.637
I can't believe I told him.

25:13.146 --> 25:15.976
Dr. Katz, I ruined the best
relationship I ever had.

25:17.751 --> 25:19.721
Remember, if you have
any pain or bruising

25:19.753 --> 25:21.130
around the incisions,
I want you to come back

25:21.154 --> 25:23.924
right away, okay?

25:25.092 --> 25:26.792
Look who I found.

25:26.827 --> 25:28.657
Jesse!

25:28.696 --> 25:29.926
Oh, you brought flowers.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.203
They're so pretty.

25:31.231 --> 25:32.341
Red flowers mean love, I think.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.605
Do they mean love?

25:33.634 --> 25:35.944
Yeah, they do.

25:42.676 --> 25:45.176
I know you're scared.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.352
We haven't spent
very much time together.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.751
Liv, you're my best friend.

25:49.783 --> 25:50.823
Same.

25:50.851 --> 25:52.821
And...
if it's okay with you,

25:52.853 --> 25:55.353
I'd still really like
to be your husband.

25:55.388 --> 25:58.628
I love you, too.

25:58.659 --> 26:00.989
I want to be your wifey.

26:06.366 --> 26:08.277
We should talk. I can help
you find Martha's ashes,

26:08.301 --> 26:10.113
but then I think it's best
if we keep our distance.

26:10.137 --> 26:11.777
No, I don't want to...

26:11.805 --> 26:13.975
I'm sorry.
Just one second.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.307
The urn is here!

26:15.342 --> 26:17.220
Wait, it's not here,
it's at a depot across town,

26:17.244 --> 26:19.254
and they close in an hour.
An hour?!

26:19.279 --> 26:21.309
No, I say we forget the urn
and focus on the ashes.

26:21.348 --> 26:22.678
We don't have the ashes.

26:22.716 --> 26:24.116
Then we'll get someone else's.

26:24.151 --> 26:25.929
My cousin, Jerry, he can get
his hands on anything

26:25.953 --> 26:27.296
if you give him a few hours
and pay cash.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.720
What are you talking about?

26:28.756 --> 26:30.816
I'm not switching out
Martha's ashes.

26:30.858 --> 26:32.888
Okay, then we'll divide
to conquer.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.656
You get the urn
before the place closes,

26:34.695 --> 26:36.705
I'll rally the troops
and find the ashes.

26:36.730 --> 26:38.000
We can do this, Maggie!

26:38.031 --> 26:39.171
Ready, jump!

26:40.267 --> 26:41.667
Guys, I know
this seems like fun,

26:41.702 --> 26:42.912
but it's actually
quite dangerous.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.080
Well, we've never felt closer.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.644
Why would we give that up?

26:45.673 --> 26:47.183
Because the longer
you stay out of your bodies,

26:47.207 --> 26:49.137
the harder it's gonna be
to get back in them.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.351
Dev: Blood won't
stop coming.

26:59.386 --> 27:01.030
There must be several
micro-capillary ruptures.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.764
If we don't relieve
the pressure quickly...

27:02.790 --> 27:04.167
It will block the blood flow
to the brain.

27:04.191 --> 27:06.035
That's right. And then she
won't ever wake up again.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.829
Thank you.

27:10.831 --> 27:12.061
Here it comes.
Ready?

27:12.099 --> 27:13.369
Jump!

27:15.068 --> 27:16.279
It feels like
you're suspended in space

27:16.303 --> 27:17.943
for, like, a split second.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.215
Come on, Charlie!
Hit the 2 button.

27:19.239 --> 27:21.069
We'll all jump together.

27:21.108 --> 27:22.285
You got to think about the long
lives you're gonna have together

27:22.309 --> 27:24.139
once you're both healthy.

27:24.177 --> 27:25.707
You can go to the same colleges,

27:25.746 --> 27:28.146
you can backpack
across wherever.

27:28.181 --> 27:29.451
2 minutes, 55 seconds.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.382
Okay, I found the bleeder.
Suction, please.

27:31.418 --> 27:33.418
You're gonna have your whole
lives in front of you,

27:33.453 --> 27:34.893
but you got to be alive.

27:35.923 --> 27:37.693
Whoa.
What is it?

27:37.725 --> 27:40.095
I feel really light
all of a sudden...

27:40.127 --> 27:42.927
like I'm floating for real.

27:42.963 --> 27:45.003
Am I floating?

27:51.171 --> 27:53.171
Shahir?

27:53.206 --> 27:54.866
What happened to the girl
in O.R. 2?

27:54.908 --> 27:56.208
She had a hemorrhagic stroke.

27:56.243 --> 27:58.853
I couldn't restore
the blood flow in time.

28:01.448 --> 28:04.148
I should inform the parents.

28:08.789 --> 28:11.319
I don't feel dead.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.728
I don't feel anything.

28:13.761 --> 28:16.961
Yeah, that's...

28:16.997 --> 28:21.227
that's because a ventilator
is breathing for you.

28:21.268 --> 28:24.268
All I wanted was a little
more time to feel normal,

28:24.304 --> 28:26.114
to be with Vicky.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.269
I didn't know that this
was going to happen.

28:28.308 --> 28:30.738
It's okay.

28:30.778 --> 28:33.278
Now we can stay
like this forever.

28:33.313 --> 28:38.523
No.
No, you can't.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.921
I'm sorry.

28:45.025 --> 28:47.165
Vicky...

28:47.194 --> 28:49.264
you still have a chance.

28:49.296 --> 28:52.056
But not with Erin.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.099
Erin...

28:54.134 --> 28:55.244
your little sister needs you.

28:55.268 --> 28:58.338
I think it's time to step up.

29:03.043 --> 29:04.283
Vicky, we don't have much time.

29:04.311 --> 29:06.111
I'm not going.

29:06.146 --> 29:09.016
Listen, you've done everything
that you can for me.

29:09.049 --> 29:10.549
Okay?

29:10.583 --> 29:14.453
Now it's time to live
your life for you.

29:14.487 --> 29:18.887
Do it for me.
Please.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.286
Go on the rides
at Wonder Land...

29:21.328 --> 29:24.058
the biggest, scariest ones.

29:24.097 --> 29:27.527
Scream at the top of your lungs.

29:27.567 --> 29:30.467
It's the last thing
I'll ever ask of you.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.773
I promise.

29:41.381 --> 29:42.951
Ready to close.

29:48.055 --> 29:49.098
Well, it doesn't make any sense.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.292
The VAD is working properly.

29:50.323 --> 29:52.163
She must be in RV failure.
Close her up.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.602
What does that mean,
the LVAD's not enough?

29:53.626 --> 29:56.796
No, the heart muscle is too weak
to pick up the slack.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.532
Keep her heart beating.
I'll be right back.

30:02.569 --> 30:03.969
Let's get her back on pump.

30:04.004 --> 30:06.344
What's going on?

30:06.373 --> 30:09.483
Vicky was stable,
now her vitals are on the floor.

30:09.509 --> 30:11.839
Um...

30:11.879 --> 30:15.449
Erin didn't survive her surgery.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.082
She's brain dead.

30:17.117 --> 30:18.847
And, uh...

30:18.886 --> 30:21.986
Vicky doesn't want to leave
without her sister.

30:22.022 --> 30:24.992
Well, Charlie,
we can't lose them both.

30:25.025 --> 30:26.435
I know.

30:28.095 --> 30:31.465
Maybe there's a way
we can save Vicky...

30:31.498 --> 30:33.998
and let them stay together.

30:34.034 --> 30:36.144
That's all we want.

30:39.272 --> 30:42.312

32:41.394 --> 32:42.671
while I'm in the middle
of a heart transplant,

32:42.695 --> 32:44.005
so you... you...

32:44.031 --> 32:45.361
No, no, you listen.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.343
My mom may not have been
a saint, but she deserves

32:47.367 --> 32:49.337
to be remembered by the people
that loved her

32:49.369 --> 32:53.009
in the beautiful garden terrace
that I booked over a week ago.

32:55.508 --> 32:58.438
No, I... understand.

33:22.202 --> 33:24.542
Well...
I'm an ass.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.538
You are.

33:28.575 --> 33:33.555
I've been stuck in a loop for...

33:33.580 --> 33:36.680
since we were kids.

33:36.716 --> 33:40.316
Missing Dad, blaming Mom.

33:40.353 --> 33:42.553
Resenting you for...

33:42.589 --> 33:44.459
rising above it all.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.456
Lexi, I'm not mad at you.

33:48.495 --> 33:51.335
I'm mad because I thought
I was gonna have a chance

33:51.364 --> 33:54.804
to patch things up with Mom.

33:54.834 --> 33:58.504
Before she died...

33:58.538 --> 34:02.668
she reached out to me, and I...

34:02.709 --> 34:07.209
just thought I had more time.

34:07.247 --> 34:09.717
Yeah.

34:09.748 --> 34:15.719
But...
I'm here now.

34:15.755 --> 34:19.295
I want to come to the memorial.

34:19.326 --> 34:22.326
Oh.

34:22.362 --> 34:26.132
That's the thing, there...
there is no memorial now.

34:26.166 --> 34:29.835
It's double-booked.
They just called, so...

34:31.904 --> 34:33.873
Well...

34:33.906 --> 34:37.476
you and I both know
when the Reids want to party,

34:37.510 --> 34:39.480
no, nothing can stop us.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.483
Give me an hour.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.577
An hour?

34:45.618 --> 34:47.118
All right?

34:47.154 --> 34:48.824
Okay.

35:08.408 --> 35:10.578
Okay, Charlie,
why am I blindfolded?

35:10.610 --> 35:12.310
Um...

35:12.345 --> 35:13.685
'Cause your brother's
a weird guy.

35:13.713 --> 35:15.383
Yeah, but I do love him.

35:15.415 --> 35:16.685
Mm-hmm.
Hang on, hang on there.

35:16.716 --> 35:18.476
Okay.

35:18.518 --> 35:19.888
All right, the big reveal.

35:19.919 --> 35:21.449
All right.

35:24.491 --> 35:25.821
Wow.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.258
I hope it's okay.

35:27.294 --> 35:29.504
I know it's not
a fancy garden party.

35:29.529 --> 35:31.599
Are you kidding me?
It's perfect!

35:31.631 --> 35:32.801
Mom would love this.

35:32.832 --> 35:34.502
How did you do this in an hour?

35:34.534 --> 35:36.874
Well, you know, after you
called me an alcoholic,

35:36.903 --> 35:38.603
I went to a pub on the corner.

35:38.638 --> 35:41.868
And as it turns out,
the guy who runs the place...

35:41.908 --> 35:43.638
had his own party planned
for tonight.

35:43.676 --> 35:45.776
So I went back asked and him
if we could borrow it

35:45.812 --> 35:47.452
and told him
the family sob story.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.550
You're incredible.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.821
Hey, at least the family curse

35:49.849 --> 35:52.249
finally worked
to our advantage, huh?

35:52.285 --> 35:54.825
Uh, him and his buddies
are coming at 10:00.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.824
I hope that's not weird.

35:56.856 --> 35:59.656
Well, you know Mom's party
motto... the more, the merrier!

35:59.692 --> 36:01.532
Let's get our drink on!

36:11.571 --> 36:15.541
You okay?

36:15.575 --> 36:17.645
You're being quiet.

36:20.480 --> 36:25.250
I had a young patient today...

36:25.285 --> 36:27.755
I couldn't save her.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.686
I can't stop thinking about
her parents.

36:32.725 --> 36:35.365
It's this adoption, Jonathan.

36:35.395 --> 36:40.605
It's making me feel things
I don't want to feel.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.543
It's making me a worse doctor.

36:45.672 --> 36:50.982
Look, I can't control
how you're feeling, Shahir...

36:51.010 --> 36:53.480
but I can be here for you.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.892
Alex, there are no words
to describe

37:01.921 --> 37:05.391
the remorseful feelings
that I feel.

37:05.425 --> 37:07.865
Alex: Maggie?

37:07.894 --> 37:09.604
The urn...
it's beautiful.

37:09.629 --> 37:11.329
Isn't it?
Yeah.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.034
It's also empty.
What?

37:13.065 --> 37:16.745
We thought you'd want
to put the ashes in yourself.

37:16.769 --> 37:18.799
Of course.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.645
Thanks, Maggs.

37:27.780 --> 37:29.750
Please do not tell me
those are from cousin Jerry.

37:31.050 --> 37:32.980
No.
It's Martha!

37:33.019 --> 37:35.619
Thank you!

37:35.655 --> 37:37.825
Let's take a walk.

37:42.695 --> 37:46.875
I'm really happy you're here.

37:46.899 --> 37:48.899
Ever since I met you,
I've wondered

37:48.935 --> 37:51.305
what it would be like
to be with you...

37:51.338 --> 37:53.038
to actually be with you.

37:53.072 --> 37:55.912
Is that such
a frightening prospect?

37:55.942 --> 37:58.782
It's paralyzing, actually.

37:58.811 --> 38:00.951
It's like I've been waiting
three years for Christmas,

38:00.980 --> 38:02.980
and now it's finally here and...

38:03.015 --> 38:05.325
I'm Jewish.

38:05.352 --> 38:09.392
Both:

38:09.422 --> 38:13.992
What if we can't live up
to the expectations?

38:14.026 --> 38:15.756
You know, today,
we kind of fast-forwarded

38:15.795 --> 38:17.005
through a Shidduch.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.559
What is that?

38:18.598 --> 38:20.898
It's an Orthodox thing...
It's when you go on

38:20.933 --> 38:23.543
a series of dates
and you talk about big things

38:23.570 --> 38:26.810
like morals and values,
and by the end of it,

38:26.839 --> 38:28.739
you know if you're compatible
or not.

38:28.775 --> 38:31.815
I'm gonna say we didn't pass
with flying colors.

38:31.844 --> 38:34.554
No, we did not.

38:34.581 --> 38:38.721
But it didn't make me
want to be with you any less.

38:38.751 --> 38:42.751
Maggie, I don't want some epic,
tortured love affair with you.

38:42.789 --> 38:45.689
I just want you.

38:45.725 --> 38:47.595
Okay.

38:49.095 --> 38:52.105
Promise me you're not
gonna leave again.

No, he's not.

Alex: In the end, Martha's
legacy wasn't her flaws

41:30.222 --> 41:32.992
as a mother or her illness.

Rest in peace, Mom.
You deserve it.
