00:04.215 --> 00:06.966
(upbeat punk music)

00:06.967 --> 00:08.928
[Announcer] Unemployment
in the valley is rising,

00:08.929 --> 00:10.778
as more and more workers
are being replaced

00:10.779 --> 00:14.161
by automation at warehouses in the area.

00:14.162 --> 00:16.546
[Announcer] Your XXX.

00:16.547 --> 00:19.318
Put your XXX on anything in any way,

00:19.319 --> 00:23.022
and you can win 10,000 bucks.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.857
(radio static)

00:23.858 --> 00:25.234
[Man] I'm trying to deal
with these serious matters,

00:25.235 --> 00:28.088
as we all are, September's
gonna be a very difficult month.

00:28.089 --> 00:29.873
(cheering)

00:29.874 --> 00:33.878
(energetic marching band music)

00:39.904 --> 00:42.501
Hello, Lehigh Valley!

00:42.502 --> 00:46.081
We're coming to you live
from the great WTYT 960

00:46.082 --> 00:47.490
Billboard Sitting Contest!

00:47.491 --> 00:49.767
No one said we'd have
this kind of turnout.

00:49.768 --> 00:52.976
You made it happen, boss-man.

00:52.977 --> 00:53.811
Yes.

00:53.812 --> 00:55.264
Come on, people, I
need some energy here.

00:55.265 --> 00:56.764
Are you excited, are you ready?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.647
(cheering)
Okay, well, here they are!

00:59.648 --> 01:01.066
Please welcome...

01:04.063 --> 01:05.629
We have Shelby Reynolds.

Josh Richards.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.023
And Clark Thompson.

01:14.422 --> 01:18.919
We have four great WTYT

01:20.410 --> 01:23.803
They will live on this billboard in a tent

01:23.804 --> 01:28.809
for the chance to win a
mobile home and $96,000.

01:32.249 --> 01:35.343
(crowd cheering)

01:35.344 --> 01:36.756
Okay, will the contestants please

01:36.757 --> 01:38.337
make their way to the ladder?

01:38.338 --> 01:41.841
So, Lehigh Valley, are we ready to get

01:41.842 --> 01:46.598
the great WTYT Billboard
Sitting Contest underway?

01:46.599 --> 01:48.851
(cheering)

01:51.522 --> 01:55.471
Okay, contestants, let the ascent begin.

01:55.472 --> 02:00.477
[Crowd] 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven--

02:01.692 --> 02:02.594
Wait, wait.

02:02.595 --> 02:05.546
There seems to be a problem
with Junior, folks, uh.

02:05.547 --> 02:08.132
(somber music)

02:27.524 --> 02:28.628
[Female Voice On Radio]
Times are tough right now.

02:28.629 --> 02:30.870
Everyone in this city is
chasing the American dream,

02:30.871 --> 02:34.738
thinking, hey, why not me?

02:37.514 --> 02:38.488
[Female Voice On Radio]
What do you expect with only

02:38.489 --> 02:40.469
three news outlets in Allentown?

02:40.470 --> 02:42.448
All of the news to be reported?

02:42.449 --> 02:44.303
[Male Voice On Radio] And
there's been some debate

02:44.304 --> 02:46.310
as to the size of Allentown.

02:46.311 --> 02:48.868
According to the latest census reports,

02:48.869 --> 02:52.732
we have over 118,000
people living in our city,

02:52.733 --> 02:57.738
who make, on average, $16,282 per year.

02:57.788 --> 03:00.267
Now, that's about as much as other cities.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.834
(muffled rock music)

03:50.192 --> 03:52.277
(crying)

04:15.908 --> 04:18.744
(exhaling deeply)

04:29.019 --> 04:30.824
You didn't pay the water bill, Dad?

04:33.039 --> 04:34.555
I gotta pay the water bill.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.451
And the electric.

04:49.202 --> 04:50.202
Okay.

04:54.015 --> 04:56.155
Doesn't fuckin' work.

04:56.156 --> 04:58.458
Hey, Henry, can you come
in here for a second?

05:01.031 --> 05:02.031
Henry?

05:02.843 --> 05:04.083
What's up, boss-man?

05:04.084 --> 05:05.214
And don't call me that, please.

05:05.215 --> 05:06.526
Well, you are.

05:06.527 --> 05:07.628
You'll get used to it.

05:08.770 --> 05:10.700
Who runs the books?

05:10.701 --> 05:11.791
Well, your dad hired me to,

05:11.792 --> 05:14.163
but never handed over the reins.

05:14.164 --> 05:16.415
I just handle our sales
accounts, promotions,

05:16.416 --> 05:18.647
marketing, and operations.

05:18.648 --> 05:19.481
That's it.

05:19.482 --> 05:21.450
Yep, that's it.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.663
I mean, there's no PNL,
or something like that?

05:23.664 --> 05:25.215
If there is, I never saw one.

05:26.336 --> 05:28.317
I mean, there were a lot of days your dad

05:28.318 --> 05:31.010
really struggled, but
he always found a way

05:31.011 --> 05:32.491
to keep the station alive.

05:32.492 --> 05:33.653
So there's no one here that knows

05:33.654 --> 05:35.706
the financial status of the station.

05:35.707 --> 05:37.026
[Henry] Hm, Jezebel might.

05:37.027 --> 05:38.127
She's been here the longest.

05:38.128 --> 05:39.148
Well, can you go get her for a second?

05:39.149 --> 05:41.001
She's on air for another two hours.

05:49.089 --> 05:50.670
How am I supposed to run a radio station

05:50.671 --> 05:51.505
when I don't know anything about it?

05:51.506 --> 05:53.482
Come on, radio's in your blood.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.605
No, I know nothing
about the radio business.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.006
And neither did your dad.

05:57.007 --> 06:01.555
He just went with his gut,
and in your guts is his DNA.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.140
Look, I don't know what to
say, but you can do this.

06:08.919 --> 06:11.270
I gotta find a way to save his legacy.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.096
And all of us here want that too.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.069
Where do we start?

06:20.070 --> 06:22.311
Welcome, joining us
today is Casey Lindeweiler.

06:22.312 --> 06:25.572
He's the creator of the WTYT
Billboard Sitting Contest

06:25.573 --> 06:28.477
and the owner of the WTYT radio station.

06:28.478 --> 06:29.525
Welcome, Casey.

06:29.526 --> 06:31.250
(audience applauding)

06:31.251 --> 06:32.576
Casey, thanks for being here.

06:32.577 --> 06:33.410
Yeah, thanks for having me.

06:33.411 --> 06:35.625
Tell me a little bit
about your background first.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.797
Well, I inherited the
station from my father,

06:37.798 --> 06:40.103
who passed away a few months ago.

06:40.104 --> 06:44.173
And before that I was a
cartoonist living in Santa Monica.

06:44.174 --> 06:46.435
And your station has seen
a lot of platform changes

06:46.436 --> 06:47.367
over the years, hasn't it?

06:47.368 --> 06:49.959
Yeah, my father liked
to move with the times.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.682
And now you're an AM station
playing alternative music.

06:52.683 --> 06:54.724
Yeah, he felt that AM
programming was moving

06:54.725 --> 06:56.968
more towards the alternative
crowd, so he thought,

06:56.969 --> 07:00.948
you know, stick with them,
and they're the loyal fans.

07:00.949 --> 07:03.494
[Henry] What time is it?

07:03.495 --> 07:04.495
3:45.

07:10.804 --> 07:11.804
Here it is.

07:13.198 --> 07:14.198
Wow.

07:16.873 --> 07:18.818
It's really this bad.

07:18.819 --> 07:19.819
[Casey] Yeah.

07:20.784 --> 07:21.985
[Henry] I had no idea.

07:29.209 --> 07:30.333
This was his life.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.814
It's what he wanted.

07:34.815 --> 07:37.627
[Henry] Look, let's get some sleep,

07:37.628 --> 07:39.198
and come up with a plan,

07:39.199 --> 07:41.721
come back at this in the morning, okay?

07:41.722 --> 07:42.779
I can't sleep.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.097
But this girl needs to.

07:45.004 --> 07:46.906
Well, thanks for sticking around.

07:46.907 --> 07:48.337
I appreciate it.

07:48.338 --> 07:49.478
No problem.

07:49.479 --> 07:51.030
Get some sleep, boss-man.

07:51.031 --> 07:51.865
You're gonna need it.

07:51.866 --> 07:53.056
Don't call me that.

07:57.805 --> 08:00.808
(crickets chirping)

08:03.146 --> 08:05.816
(clock ticking)

08:50.811 --> 08:51.974
His dad never made us wait.

08:51.975 --> 08:52.975
Hey, guys.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.408
This is gonna be fun.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.213
Hey, all right.

08:57.214 --> 08:58.437
All right, thanks for coming down,

08:58.438 --> 09:00.946
I appreciate you guys meeting with me.

09:00.947 --> 09:02.191
I've been trying to
get everything together

09:02.192 --> 09:06.225
since my dad passed away,
and I'm not really sure how

09:06.226 --> 09:09.649
he kept this place going for
as long as he did, you know?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.563
Basically I have about two months' savings

09:12.564 --> 09:16.526
to keep this place going,
and what I'm thinking is

09:16.527 --> 09:18.904
we gotta raise the rates
and bring in the income.

09:18.905 --> 09:21.180
Don't we need better
ratings to be able to do that?

09:21.181 --> 09:22.181
Yeah.

09:25.787 --> 09:28.337
Well, I mean, you guys
are the professionals,

09:28.338 --> 09:31.430
I'm not gonna pretend like
I know what I'm doing here,

09:31.431 --> 09:33.232
so if you have any ideas.

09:33.233 --> 09:36.155
Look, do we even have
any money for like,

09:36.156 --> 09:37.897
a promotional thing?

09:37.898 --> 09:40.259
I'm not sure people still know we exist.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.308
Lots of stations do it to
get their brand out there.

09:42.309 --> 09:44.116
You sponsor some shows, or--

09:44.117 --> 09:45.055
How much would that cost?

09:45.056 --> 09:46.339
[Ronny] A couple thousand.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.889
Yeah, we could do a contest.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.755
Okay, what kind of contest?

09:54.484 --> 09:57.661
I don't know, you know,
something that's memorable.

10:08.889 --> 10:11.340
Hey, do we still own that billboard?

10:11.341 --> 10:12.632
I have no idea.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.514
Wait, what, we own a billboard?

10:14.515 --> 10:15.735
You don't know about the billboard?

10:15.736 --> 10:17.046
- No.
- No.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.407
Shit, my dad bought this billboard.

10:18.408 --> 10:22.092
We built forts on it, yeah, whatever.

10:22.093 --> 10:25.168
Go find out if we still own the billboard.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.174
[Henry] Okay.

10:27.175 --> 10:28.447
[Casey] It's on the
Rothrock parking lot.

10:28.448 --> 10:29.809
Yep, you got it, boss-man.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.210
I got it.

10:31.211 --> 10:35.089
We're gonna hold a
billboard sitting contest.

10:35.090 --> 10:35.924
[Jezebel] What?

10:35.925 --> 10:39.132
Yeah, three, four people
living on a billboard.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.300
To win a prize.

10:41.301 --> 10:43.804
That is the stupidest.

10:43.805 --> 10:45.223
[Jezebel] Dude.

10:46.501 --> 10:49.559
Craziest idea I've ever heard.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.133
Okay, maybe it's crazy,
but maybe it's crazy enough

10:51.134 --> 10:54.784
to get people to tune
in and save our jobs.

10:54.785 --> 10:59.438
Okay, so it would be like
reality TV, but on the radio.

10:59.439 --> 11:01.273
Exactly, something like that.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.892
It's pretty smart, that could work.

11:02.893 --> 11:03.893
Thank you.

11:05.055 --> 11:08.107
No, this is it, this is perfect, okay?

11:08.108 --> 11:09.707
It could change radio.

11:09.708 --> 11:10.840
(chuckling)

11:10.841 --> 11:12.065
Slow down, Welles.

11:13.814 --> 11:14.648
Orson Welles.

11:14.649 --> 11:15.685
Yes, I know.

11:15.686 --> 11:18.407
Anyway, it's gonna be
a logistical nightmare.

11:18.408 --> 11:20.908
I mean, a really big logistical nightmare,

11:20.909 --> 11:22.976
but I don't have anything going on.

11:24.424 --> 11:26.365
[Casey] So you're in.

11:26.366 --> 11:28.057
I mean, yeah, I guess so.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.059
Yep, you are the proud
owner of a billboard.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.360
Yes!

11:31.361 --> 11:32.361
We're doing it.

11:33.223 --> 11:35.985
Okay, we're gonna make this all-American,

11:35.986 --> 11:39.500
inspirational, and, you know.

11:39.501 --> 11:41.731
Like the fight for independence.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.032
Independent radio.

11:43.033 --> 11:47.190
Sure, I guess it's time to
break out the tricorn hats.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.980
[Announcer] WTYT 960.

11:56.981 --> 12:00.754
Your only alternative rock AM station.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.783
Thanks for coming out today.

12:03.784 --> 12:06.852
It's great to see so many
smiling faces out there.

12:06.853 --> 12:09.669
I deeply appreciate all of the kind words

12:09.670 --> 12:12.962
you sent me about the
passing of my father.

12:12.963 --> 12:15.559
It's really nice to feel the
support of your community.

12:16.673 --> 12:18.768
Well, as I look around
today at the Lehigh Valley,

12:18.769 --> 12:20.860
it's hard to not notice all of

12:20.861 --> 12:23.132
the revitalization that's taking place.

12:23.133 --> 12:26.816
Old mills being repurposed
as tourist attractions

12:26.817 --> 12:29.238
and cultural centers.

12:29.239 --> 12:34.244
Well, we here at WTYT want to, uh,

12:34.655 --> 12:37.346
want to rise from the ashes of our past

12:37.347 --> 12:39.242
and become a phoenix of opportunity.

12:40.851 --> 12:43.232
Ladies and gentlemen, we're here today

12:43.233 --> 12:48.061
to announce the great WTYT
960 Billboard Sitting Contest.

12:49.871 --> 12:51.641
(clapping)

12:51.642 --> 12:52.573
This will be a--

12:52.574 --> 12:54.113
[Announcer] Squeak out
another victory against the--

12:54.114 --> 12:56.506
Where four lucky people
will live on a billboard

12:56.507 --> 12:58.858
until only one remains.

12:58.859 --> 13:00.930
To become a contestant,
all you need to do is

13:00.931 --> 13:05.304
create a profile and a
video on wtyt960.com,

13:05.305 --> 13:10.129
and the most votes you get,
the person with the most votes

13:10.130 --> 13:13.763
will become our contestants.

13:13.764 --> 13:16.392
Let's see, we'll be accepting submissions

13:16.393 --> 13:19.318
starting immediately,
and the contest starts

13:19.319 --> 13:22.056
on September 1st, so
thanks again for coming.

13:22.057 --> 13:23.853
Are there any questions?

13:23.854 --> 13:26.455
Is this just some scheme
to drum up listeners?

13:26.456 --> 13:29.368
Look, we're trying to
save the only remaining

13:29.369 --> 13:31.981
independent radio
station in Lehigh Valley,

13:31.982 --> 13:33.491
and at the same time create some

13:33.492 --> 13:35.078
great opportunities for people.

13:35.079 --> 13:35.913
How?

13:35.914 --> 13:37.380
Well, we're gonna be giving out prizes

13:37.381 --> 13:40.039
to the remaining person.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.040
Like what?

13:41.992 --> 13:45.474
Like $960 thousand.

13:45.475 --> 13:47.386
And a brand-new mobile home.

13:47.387 --> 13:48.788
Let me get this straight.

13:48.789 --> 13:49.929
Your AM station--

13:49.930 --> 13:51.741
Alternative rock AM station.

13:51.742 --> 13:53.794
Your alternative rock AM station

13:53.795 --> 13:56.280
is hosting a billboard sitting contest

13:56.281 --> 14:00.402
where people can win a mobile
home and $960 thousand?

14:00.403 --> 14:01.911
That's exactly correct,

14:01.912 --> 14:03.613
I couldn't have said it better myself.

14:03.614 --> 14:04.447
Can I enter?

14:04.448 --> 14:06.335
Yeah, of course, just create a profile

14:06.336 --> 14:10.259
on wtyt960.com and get your votes in.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.682
Why this sort of contest?

14:12.683 --> 14:14.508
We want to make radio fun again.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.263
You know?

14:17.264 --> 14:21.638
And we wanna give a
couple people hope and,

14:21.639 --> 14:24.754
you know, the opportunity to get ahead.

14:24.755 --> 14:27.532
Isn't that what the American
dream is all about, right?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.630
(clapping)

14:29.631 --> 14:30.960
All right, thank you guys for coming out,

14:30.961 --> 14:32.012
really appreciate it.

14:33.994 --> 14:36.435
Okay, so you heard it here first, folks.

14:36.436 --> 14:39.965
This station, WTYT 960, is
giving you, the listeners,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.201
the opportunity of a lifetime.

14:42.202 --> 14:43.873
And what's the response
been from the public

14:43.874 --> 14:45.785
about the contest so far?

14:45.786 --> 14:48.447
Um, well, you know, I always feel like

14:48.448 --> 14:50.530
you're gonna have people
who love what you do

14:50.531 --> 14:51.364
and others that don't,

14:51.365 --> 14:53.466
but overall it's been really positive.

14:55.471 --> 14:57.200
[Announcer] This is the morning grind.

14:57.201 --> 14:58.201
$960,000?

15:03.337 --> 15:04.337
Shit.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.083
- Prize money, yeah.
- Who's doing that?

15:14.084 --> 15:16.146
- It's a radio station, right?
- Right.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.017
What kinda station is it?

15:17.018 --> 15:18.668
Beats me.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.039
Never even heard of it.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.350
They're an AM station.

15:21.351 --> 15:22.848
[Woman] Who listens to AM?

15:22.849 --> 15:24.552
(laughing)

15:24.553 --> 15:26.513
[Woman] Imagine what we
could do with that prize money.

15:26.514 --> 15:28.477
[Man] What would you do with it?

15:28.478 --> 15:30.491
Where four lucky people
will live on a billboard

15:30.492 --> 15:32.762
until only one remains.

15:32.763 --> 15:34.493
To become a contestant, all you need to do

15:34.494 --> 15:36.165
is create a profile.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.157
Why would I do something like that?

15:38.158 --> 15:40.057
Well, haven't you heard
about the big contest?

15:40.058 --> 15:41.440
No.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.172
Well, there's a contest going on,

15:43.173 --> 15:45.422
and if you're the last one on
the billboard, you win a home.

15:45.423 --> 15:46.716
[Male DJ] Tamara, did you
read the paper this morning?

15:46.717 --> 15:48.037
[Tamara] And why would I?

15:48.038 --> 15:50.300
[Male DJ] Well, it seems
our so-called competition

15:50.301 --> 15:53.943
has dreamt up a stupid contest to try and

15:53.944 --> 15:57.096
get our listeners to
tune into their station.

15:57.097 --> 15:57.978
[Tamara] Oh, now what?

15:57.979 --> 15:59.298
[Male DJ] Well, yeah.

15:59.299 --> 16:02.371
These bozos over at WTYT are holding

16:02.372 --> 16:04.747
a billboard squatting contest.

16:04.748 --> 16:06.085
[Tamara] Are you kidding?

16:06.086 --> 16:08.292
[Male DJ] Yeah, they're
trying to get four birdbrains

16:08.293 --> 16:10.019
to live on a billboard.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.470
Have you seen this?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.744
No, but I heard about it.

16:14.745 --> 16:16.475
Let me guess, on one of our stations.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.587
Everyone's talking about it.

16:17.588 --> 16:20.199
For the last time,
you only mention things

16:20.200 --> 16:22.091
we're paid to mention,
we only promote things

16:22.092 --> 16:23.943
we are paid to promote.

16:23.944 --> 16:25.625
This stops now, unless you can show me

16:25.626 --> 16:27.416
a check from Lindeweiler.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.669
My air costs money, baby.

16:29.750 --> 16:33.016
[Male DJ] What has been your
favorite XXX sighting so far?

16:35.335 --> 16:36.776
I was just trying to be radio.

16:36.777 --> 16:37.741
You were trying to be radio?

16:37.742 --> 16:40.449
I was trying to be radio
by saying 960 thousand,

16:40.450 --> 16:42.842
you know, like our call
letters, nine six thousand.

16:42.843 --> 16:44.263
Not $960,000.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.523
Yeah, but normal people
don't understand that.

16:46.524 --> 16:47.398
What are we gonna do?

16:47.399 --> 16:49.264
We might as well just quit
right now, this is insane.

16:49.265 --> 16:50.099
Hey, I made some calls.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.715
Hey, Junior, servers are down.

16:53.356 --> 16:57.426
Like I was gonna say, news
about the contest is spreading.

16:57.427 --> 16:59.488
We hit the Philly and the New York pubs.

16:59.489 --> 17:00.390
This may break national.

17:00.390 --> 17:01.288
Yeah, that's great and everything,

17:01.289 --> 17:03.002
but how are we gonna
pay for this, you guys?

17:03.003 --> 17:04.773
We're in the ratings basement right now,

17:04.775 --> 17:07.042
and we're charging, what,
like 20 bucks a spot?

17:07.044 --> 17:09.188
So we add that all up, and what do we get?

17:09.189 --> 17:10.403
We get like.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.981
I don't know.

17:11.982 --> 17:14.363
[Casey] Equals what, like, 300.

17:14.364 --> 17:16.506
Chill, okay?

17:16.507 --> 17:18.406
Just give it some time,
let's just ride this out

17:18.407 --> 17:19.719
and see what happens.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.685
All this attention is
bound to drive up ratings,

17:21.685 --> 17:24.078
and then we can increase our rates.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.913
Give it some time, don't
make any official statements,

17:26.914 --> 17:28.838
and just ride the buzz.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.909
Okay, riding the buzz,

17:29.910 --> 17:31.671
that's an absolutely great punchline.

17:31.672 --> 17:33.693
Jezebel, you've actually been
here longer than anybody.

17:33.694 --> 17:34.585
What would my dad do?

17:34.586 --> 17:38.397
He would ride the buzz,
and he would use the press

17:38.398 --> 17:39.844
to his advantage, and he would ignore

17:39.845 --> 17:43.080
the pile of bills on his
desk, so like father like son.

17:43.081 --> 17:43.915
Oh my god.

17:43.916 --> 17:47.166
Sounds like that's super great advice.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.888
So I can't even talk to the press.

17:48.889 --> 17:50.159
How are we gonna promote this, you guys?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.148
Give me something.

17:51.148 --> 17:51.982
You won't need to.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.003
Just promote the real
prize on the station,

17:54.004 --> 17:55.575
and a week before the contest,

17:55.576 --> 17:56.896
make a correction to the press.

17:56.897 --> 17:59.629
Ah, so I lie to the press,
that's the genius idea

17:59.630 --> 18:00.601
right now, lie to the press.

18:00.602 --> 18:02.001
Dude, wait, hold on.

18:02.002 --> 18:06.025
It's not lying, the press screwed up.

18:06.026 --> 18:07.366
We didn't.

18:07.367 --> 18:09.699
We'll correct it, and it will be fine.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.090
God, don't you know anything?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.972
When they find out that we don't have

18:12.973 --> 18:14.169
a million dollars, for instance,

18:14.170 --> 18:16.325
what are the contestants gonna do?

18:16.326 --> 18:17.384
They're gonna kill me.

18:17.385 --> 18:18.370
No one's gonna murder you,

18:18.371 --> 18:20.449
and people will still
wanna be a part of this.

18:20.450 --> 18:21.450
Trust me.

18:24.474 --> 18:26.796
Why is there nothing happening
in that booth right now?

18:26.797 --> 18:27.797
Goddammit!

18:27.798 --> 18:29.583
Dead air kills radio, Ronny!

18:31.922 --> 18:34.775
Sorry about that, folks,
boss-man needed some stroking.

18:36.481 --> 18:39.000
(sighing)

18:39.001 --> 18:41.587
(mellow music)

18:44.678 --> 18:48.197
[Casey] To rise from the
ashes to become a phoenix.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.129
[Girl] I'm thinking about entering

18:49.130 --> 18:50.580
that billboard contest.

18:50.581 --> 18:51.441
[Girl] Yeah, me too.

18:51.442 --> 18:52.827
[Girl] We should do it together.

18:52.828 --> 18:56.414
Yeah, I'll have to
ask my parents though.

18:59.309 --> 19:00.690
Is your life really that bad

19:00.691 --> 19:03.012
that you would want to
live on a billboard?

19:03.013 --> 19:05.478
Call into the station if
you wanna talk about it.

19:22.615 --> 19:26.008
Hey, can I trade this in for 10 more?

19:26.009 --> 19:27.009
Thanks.

19:31.233 --> 19:34.213
Ladies and gentlemen,
gentlemen, we're here today

19:34.214 --> 19:39.219
to announce the great WTYT
960 Billboard Sitting Contest.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.158
960 thousand dollars,
uh, this is a contest,

19:42.159 --> 19:45.716
this is a contest, uh, uh, great.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.177
[Female Reporter] Can
I enter, can I enter?

19:47.178 --> 19:50.409
Can I enter, can I enter,
can I enter, can I enter?

19:50.410 --> 19:52.691
Who on God's green earth would enter

19:52.692 --> 19:54.591
a billboard sitting contest?

19:54.592 --> 19:55.605
That's what I'd do.

19:55.606 --> 20:00.229
I can be on that billboard,
an I will win that contest.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.771
There's no one out
there that will beat me.

20:01.772 --> 20:04.253
I guarantee you won't be disappointed,

20:04.254 --> 20:06.240
'cause hey, that's what I am.

20:06.241 --> 20:08.117
I am a contest winner.

20:08.118 --> 20:08.952
Hey, I'm Emily.

20:08.953 --> 20:10.185
I really want to be a
billboard sitting contestant

20:10.186 --> 20:14.013
just simply because I love
reality, oh, that was bad.

20:14.014 --> 20:16.125
This is the reason why I
should be on the billboard.

20:16.126 --> 20:17.827
First of all, I'm a pro sitter.

20:17.828 --> 20:19.088
Now, you don't get this petite figure

20:19.089 --> 20:20.396
by not being able to sit.

20:20.397 --> 20:22.345
Plus, I'm a survivalist.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.180
Listen, I wanna be on that billboard.

20:41.181 --> 20:43.261
I mean, you always get all the attention.

20:43.262 --> 20:46.379
Besides, you know contests are my thing.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.820
And if it runs longer, then
I'll just take a sabbatical.

20:50.821 --> 20:53.090
It's gonna be absolutely incredible.

20:53.091 --> 20:57.187
I want you to pick me for
the billboard sitting contest.

20:57.188 --> 20:59.328
I wanna do whatever it takes to win.

20:59.329 --> 21:00.389
I'll drink my own urine.

21:00.390 --> 21:01.811
That's right, I'll drink pee.

21:01.812 --> 21:03.553
Out of a cup, out of
my hand, I don't care.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.903
I think people would vote for me,

21:04.904 --> 21:07.548
'cause I'm just a little bit crazier than

21:07.549 --> 21:10.369
the rest of the world, so
that's entertaining, right?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.846
Also, I'm a really good sitter.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.076
In high school, I was voted most likely

21:17.077 --> 21:18.889
to entertain herself on a deserted island,

21:18.890 --> 21:20.856
and that's a true story.

21:20.857 --> 21:22.454
Vote for Josh Richards Jr.

21:22.455 --> 21:25.808
Josh, or however it's gonna come up there.

21:25.809 --> 21:30.063
Because you gotta help me.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.479
You're my only hope.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.105
And you all know that I
can claim that shit, right?

21:36.106 --> 21:37.221
So what I want you to do--

21:37.222 --> 21:38.056
Clark!

21:38.056 --> 21:38.890
What?

21:38.891 --> 21:39.984
What are you doing in my room again?

21:39.985 --> 21:43.733
I was just, can I just
get some privacy please?

21:43.734 --> 21:46.489
I think it'll be fun, don't you think?

21:47.651 --> 21:49.779
There's been a lot of
excitement throughout the valley

21:49.780 --> 21:52.522
as a local radio station
is about to announce

21:52.523 --> 21:55.785
the four contestants in their
billboard sitting contest.

21:55.786 --> 21:58.784
News 13's Pat Stevens is live in Allentown

21:58.785 --> 22:00.266
outside the station.

22:00.267 --> 22:03.102
I'm here outside the WTYT 960 offices,

22:03.103 --> 22:05.244
and the buzz throughout the
valley has been deafening.

22:05.245 --> 22:07.166
Hundreds of people here waiting to see if

22:07.167 --> 22:08.751
they're lucky enough
to become a contestant

22:08.752 --> 22:10.386
to live on the billboard and to win

22:10.387 --> 22:13.062
$96,000 and a mobile home.

22:13.063 --> 22:16.415
[Reporter] I thought
it was a $960,000 prize.

22:16.416 --> 22:19.308
Station spokeswoman
Henry Lamarr corrected me,

22:19.309 --> 22:21.425
saying there was a bit
of confusion and that

22:21.426 --> 22:24.093
station owner Casey
Lindeweiler was trying to

22:24.094 --> 22:26.006
sound more radio by saying that the prize

22:26.007 --> 22:27.984
was 960 thousand dollars.

22:27.985 --> 22:29.749
The prize for whoever
stays on the billboard

22:29.750 --> 22:33.162
the longest is $96,000,
and the mobile home.

22:33.163 --> 22:35.169
The four people who
will be in the WTYT 960

22:35.170 --> 22:38.337
Billboard Sitting Contest
starting on September 1st

22:38.338 --> 22:40.580
in the Rothrock Motor Sales lot are,

22:40.581 --> 22:43.156
from Forney, Texas, Shelby Reynolds.

22:44.995 --> 22:47.169
Cookstown, Pennsylvania
native Josh Richards Jr.

22:47.170 --> 22:48.642
Stop spritzing the eggs.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.331
[Reporter] From Morristown,
New Jersey, Clark Thompson.

22:52.332 --> 22:53.973
And a lady from down the Delaware

22:53.974 --> 22:56.225
in Bucks County, Ellen Snyder.

22:56.226 --> 22:57.707
These are your four billboard sitters.

22:57.708 --> 22:59.038
Congratulations to you all,

22:59.039 --> 23:00.941
we're all excited to see what happens.

23:09.399 --> 23:10.570
Mayor.

23:10.571 --> 23:11.571
Hi, Patti.

23:12.363 --> 23:14.143
What can I do for ya?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.075
Are you really gonna let WTYT have

23:15.076 --> 23:18.252
this little building sit
without a zoning permit?

23:18.253 --> 23:20.085
There's not even a record of Lindeweiler

23:20.086 --> 23:21.731
even applying for this.

23:21.732 --> 23:23.272
It's just a little contest.

23:23.273 --> 23:24.463
Yeah, well, he's breaking the law.

23:24.464 --> 23:25.464
Here.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.028
And it would be so easy
to have your competitor

23:29.029 --> 23:31.691
on all of our stations
leading up to November.

23:31.692 --> 23:34.828
So I suggest if you want to
get reelected, look into it.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.470
And how's it going so far?

23:41.471 --> 23:43.392
Give us a little status update.

23:43.393 --> 23:45.188
Yeah, well, we started on September 1st

23:45.189 --> 23:47.206
with four contestants.

23:47.207 --> 23:48.317
[Ronny] It seems that Junior's in

23:48.318 --> 23:50.423
a bit of a pickle, if you will.

24:03.013 --> 24:04.437
Hey, everybody!

24:05.786 --> 24:07.226
Woo!

24:07.227 --> 24:10.309
Hey, thanks for coming
out and supporting us.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.565
We really appreciate it.

24:12.876 --> 24:16.495
Well, I got some strange news right now.

24:16.496 --> 24:21.320
Turns out I neglected to get
a permit for this contest.

24:21.321 --> 24:24.564
I mean, who woulda known
that you had to get a permit

24:24.565 --> 24:27.426
to get people to live on private property?

24:27.427 --> 24:28.748
It seems crazy to me.

24:28.749 --> 24:32.639
Anyway, I'm gonna say screw 'em.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.919
(cheering)

24:34.920 --> 24:36.254
Let 'em fine us!

24:38.337 --> 24:40.824
Yeah, let's get this thing started!

24:40.825 --> 24:41.825
All right, woo!

24:43.049 --> 24:44.473
All right, thank you, Junior.

24:44.474 --> 24:47.136
That's the way to keep that
independent spirit alive.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.608
Fight the man who's
trying to keep you down.

24:48.609 --> 24:50.479
I'm proud of you, boy, real proud of you.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.982
So uh, where was I?

24:52.889 --> 24:53.936
[Crowd] Seven!

24:53.937 --> 24:54.778
That's right.

24:54.779 --> 24:58.949
[Crowd] Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one!

25:01.627 --> 25:03.795
(cheering)

25:03.796 --> 25:04.630
There you go, folks!

25:04.631 --> 25:06.462
This is officially the beginning of the

25:06.463 --> 25:09.884
Great WTYT Billboard Sitting Competition.

25:11.976 --> 25:15.335
Who will win the mobile home and $96,000?

25:15.336 --> 25:19.674
Well, you're just gonna
have to tune in to find out.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.381
(booing)

25:28.382 --> 25:29.884
[Josh] Woo, XXX!

25:32.146 --> 25:33.907
Hey, hey, come on.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.393
Put your pants back on, man.

25:36.394 --> 25:37.578
[Clark] That's a dickhead move.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.860
No, youz just mad 'cause
you didn't think of it.

25:40.861 --> 25:43.113
(cheering)

25:50.320 --> 25:52.634
Thanks, guys, thank you.

25:52.635 --> 25:53.635
Thank you.

25:57.610 --> 25:59.990
You know this is just
the beginning, right?

25:59.991 --> 26:04.033
Yeah, we gotta keep this
up now, you kidding me?

26:04.034 --> 26:06.089
Yeah, I don't think we
got a bathroom up here.

26:06.927 --> 26:08.387
I really gotta go.

26:08.388 --> 26:10.007
For real?

26:10.008 --> 26:11.705
Yeah, I had too much
coffee this morning.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.326
Is Mr. Casey still here?

26:15.245 --> 26:18.087
Mr. Lindeweiler, how's we
supposed to drop a deuce up here

26:18.088 --> 26:19.260
if we ain't got a toilet?

26:19.261 --> 26:23.980
Yeah, no, we're gonna
bring it up this afternoon.

26:23.981 --> 26:25.474
Hey, you didn't bring the
toilets, are you kidding me?

26:25.475 --> 26:27.867
You know what, I'm gonna
go grab one right now,

26:27.868 --> 26:29.218
I'll be right back, okay?

26:29.219 --> 26:30.510
Look, make it quick, man!

26:30.511 --> 26:31.512
All right.

26:46.836 --> 26:49.171
(urinating)

26:52.078 --> 26:55.856
Nice work on the zoning thing.

26:55.857 --> 26:57.526
I give 'em a week.

26:59.746 --> 27:02.333
(mellow music)

27:02.334 --> 27:04.242
The pooper's here.

27:04.243 --> 27:06.524
Great, that's awesome.

27:06.525 --> 27:11.120
Hey, uh, are you cool?

27:11.121 --> 27:12.315
Yeah, yeah.

27:13.982 --> 27:14.832
Okay.

27:14.832 --> 27:15.707
Thanks.

27:15.708 --> 27:18.376
(phone chiming)

27:22.074 --> 27:23.743
Hey, I'm headed out.

27:35.517 --> 27:36.704
There you go.

27:36.705 --> 27:37.705
Thanks.

27:45.444 --> 27:48.938
When this all happened,
I was in a bad way.

27:48.939 --> 27:50.724
I lost my job, Jerry lost his.

27:53.534 --> 27:56.526
We was living out of my
'74 Cadillac DeVille.

27:56.527 --> 27:57.878
Then they came to get Emmy.

28:14.224 --> 28:15.058
[Casey] Hey, guys.

28:15.059 --> 28:16.361
Mr. Lindeweiler!

28:16.362 --> 28:18.067
Hey, call me Casey, please.

28:18.068 --> 28:21.070
Mr. Casey, sir, when do we's eat?

28:21.071 --> 28:23.824
Well, the pizza guy comes
about 11 o'clock every day.

28:24.795 --> 28:26.285
What, you didn't bring
any food up with ya?

28:26.286 --> 28:27.286
No, um.

28:28.569 --> 28:29.569
No.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.004
I'm sorry, man, I didn't
bring anything for you.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.395
No, rules is rules.

28:36.396 --> 28:37.480
This is a contest.

28:38.619 --> 28:40.910
You guys aren't gonna
share your food with him?

28:40.911 --> 28:43.176
[Clark] It's a competition, man.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.099
All right, well, get some sleep, Josh.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.536
There'll be pizza in
the morning, all right?

28:56.905 --> 28:57.905
Hmm.

28:59.115 --> 29:00.014
It's really good.

29:00.015 --> 29:02.052
I don't think I can finish it all, though.

29:07.460 --> 29:10.046
(somber music)

29:23.347 --> 29:26.183
(engine starting)

30:06.570 --> 30:08.648
DJ Kat coming at ya.

30:08.649 --> 30:11.490
Did you see who made
it up on the billboard?

30:11.491 --> 30:14.183
Can there be a more
pathetic band of losers?

30:14.184 --> 30:15.975
What are they thinking?

30:15.976 --> 30:18.838
Who's gonna tune in to
listen to that shitshow?

30:18.839 --> 30:20.850
Good luck, so-called competition.

30:20.851 --> 30:22.131
Nice knowing ya.

30:22.132 --> 30:25.324
Having a starving artist,
a wannabe, a hick,

30:25.325 --> 30:27.575
and a stroke victim up on a billboard?

30:27.576 --> 30:30.890
Imagine the stimulating
conversation to be had there.

30:30.891 --> 30:31.891
Great work.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.455
You got two ladies here,
you piece of garbage,

30:34.456 --> 30:38.294
and you go and did a thing like that.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.802
The dude's gone.

30:39.803 --> 30:41.677
[Photographer] Smile.

30:41.678 --> 30:42.678
Look down.

30:44.269 --> 30:45.695
So have you been watching the contest?

30:45.696 --> 30:47.096
No, what contest?

30:47.097 --> 30:48.777
[Photographer] This
contest, take a look.

30:51.222 --> 30:52.384
Just hangin'.

30:52.385 --> 30:53.219
What is this?

30:53.220 --> 30:54.745
Hey, youz got a couple
bucks to get me some food?

30:54.746 --> 30:56.679
I'm frickin' starving.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.589
[Woman] I knew I was
forgetting something.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.951
I only got two bucks left,

31:01.952 --> 31:03.583
I was gonna buy Emmy an ice cream with it.

31:03.584 --> 31:05.695
You should get her an ice cream then,

31:05.696 --> 31:07.156
I'll be all right.

31:07.157 --> 31:10.169
I'm here live at the WTYT
Billboard Sitting Contest,

31:10.170 --> 31:11.971
checking in on contestants
who have made it

31:11.972 --> 31:14.103
one full week sitting on the billboard.

31:14.104 --> 31:16.365
This has been a firestorm
for station owner

31:16.366 --> 31:19.088
Casey Lindeweiler, who
is here with me now.

31:19.089 --> 31:22.529
Casey, so how's it feel to
have one full week down?

31:22.530 --> 31:24.554
Well, it feels great, you know?

31:24.555 --> 31:26.816
We feel like we've got a
really positive response,

31:26.817 --> 31:29.008
thanks to all the listeners out there,

31:29.009 --> 31:31.280
and yeah, you should
probably ask the contestants.

31:31.281 --> 31:32.648
[Girls] We love you, Casey!

31:32.649 --> 31:34.614
[Girl] Oh my gosh, he's so cute!

31:34.615 --> 31:37.236
Well, quite the fan favorite.

31:37.237 --> 31:38.868
What do you plan on doing about the city

31:38.869 --> 31:40.019
trying to shut you down because

31:40.020 --> 31:42.121
you don't have the
appropriate zoning permits?

31:42.122 --> 31:44.053
Well, I say, you know, let 'em fine us.

31:44.054 --> 31:46.358
I mean, we're trying to do
something for the community,

31:46.359 --> 31:49.199
and if somebody down at
city hall thinks that

31:50.691 --> 31:53.437
we've violated some sort
of archaic zoning code,

31:53.438 --> 31:56.590
law, or something that
like, you know, bring it on.

31:57.518 --> 31:58.888
We've received some reports that

31:58.889 --> 32:01.280
Shelby is pregnant up there.

32:01.281 --> 32:03.603
Yeah, there was an argument about that.

32:03.604 --> 32:06.928
[Interviewer] Were you
providing her with the RU486?

32:06.929 --> 32:07.763
What?

32:07.763 --> 32:08.699
[Interviewer] The morning after pill.

32:08.699 --> 32:09.610
Did you provide it for her?

32:09.610 --> 32:10.610
No.

32:15.045 --> 32:16.392
[Henry] Got a sec?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.451
Yeah, what's up?

32:17.452 --> 32:18.496
- I've got the trends.
- And?

32:18.497 --> 32:20.249
- We're up.
- Really?

32:21.464 --> 32:23.072
One point, second to last.

32:23.073 --> 32:24.073
One point?

32:25.265 --> 32:27.718
We did all of that press,
and we're up one point?

32:30.180 --> 32:32.932
The Hindi Channel is up on us.

32:32.933 --> 32:33.834
I didn't even know there was

32:33.835 --> 32:36.045
that many Indians in the valley.

32:36.046 --> 32:37.046
We're improving.

32:37.888 --> 32:39.540
These are generally weeks behind.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.089
(phone ringing)

32:44.090 --> 32:44.924
[Mayor] Hello?

32:44.925 --> 32:47.176
Hey, Mayor, this is
Patti over at Free Channel.

32:47.177 --> 32:48.988
Why are those four people
up on the billboard?

32:48.989 --> 32:49.920
I thought we had an agreement.

32:49.921 --> 32:50.963
What can I do if he's ignoring the law?

32:50.964 --> 32:52.782
You throw him in jail.

32:52.783 --> 32:54.143
How will that look?

32:54.144 --> 32:55.682
I'm in the middle of
a reelection campaign,

32:55.683 --> 32:57.617
he has the community support.

32:57.618 --> 32:58.620
Yeah, well, remember where your support

32:58.621 --> 33:00.419
and your promotion come from.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.215
We can easily blackball you.

33:07.247 --> 33:08.678
This is Goss coming at you live

33:08.679 --> 33:10.427
from the billboard sitting contest.

33:10.428 --> 33:11.493
Congratulations, Josh,

33:11.494 --> 33:14.884
you are WXEN Show Us Your XXX winner.

33:14.885 --> 33:15.887
How do you feel?

33:15.888 --> 33:17.897
I'm super psyched.

33:17.898 --> 33:22.191
Finally, I'm a winner, and this
is just a start, you'll see.

33:22.192 --> 33:24.163
That on?

33:24.164 --> 33:25.484
Hey, Emmy!

33:25.485 --> 33:26.592
I love you!

33:26.593 --> 33:27.947
(laughing)

33:27.948 --> 33:29.252
Hey, Donna!

33:29.253 --> 33:31.334
How 'bout it?

33:31.335 --> 33:32.803
I'm gonna be a winner, woo!

33:33.904 --> 33:37.416
Dude, WXEN is conducting
interviews with our contestants.

33:37.417 --> 33:38.358
So what?

33:38.359 --> 33:40.980
So, Josh, he just won
their stupid little contest

33:40.981 --> 33:42.221
with that stunt he pulled.

33:42.222 --> 33:43.933
Well, good for him.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.516
But it was at our expense.

33:45.517 --> 33:47.483
What do you want me to do about it?

33:47.484 --> 33:48.578
I dunno.

33:48.579 --> 33:50.520
Maybe do something, do anything.

33:50.521 --> 33:52.401
I can't disqualify him.

33:52.402 --> 33:54.564
If I disqualify him, we'll
look like pussies, come on.

33:54.565 --> 33:55.975
You can't disqualify him?

33:55.976 --> 33:58.558
Well, for your information,
he's wearing a WXEN t-shirt

33:58.559 --> 34:00.269
on our billboard right now.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.391
It's press, though, it's good press.

34:02.392 --> 34:03.315
It'll be fine.

34:03.316 --> 34:04.624
Don't worry about it.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.685
You're a real jerkoff, you know that?

34:05.686 --> 34:06.742
Real jerkoff.

34:06.743 --> 34:07.911
Yeah, right.

34:13.822 --> 34:15.324
Uh, yeah, hi, I'm calling about Clark,

34:15.324 --> 34:16.702
the billboard contestant.

34:16.703 --> 34:18.047
He carried a guitar up
there with him when he

34:18.047 --> 34:20.099
went up on the billboard, and
it wasn't in his backpack.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.301
They're allowed to have
other stuff up there.

34:22.302 --> 34:23.850
There's a picture in the
Gazette that clearly shows him

34:23.851 --> 34:25.902
carrying up a guitar with
him when he went up there,

34:25.902 --> 34:28.257
and on your website it states
that you can only take up

34:28.257 --> 34:30.299
what you can fit into your backpack.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.888
Henry, where are you?

34:31.889 --> 34:33.750
Are you listening?

34:33.751 --> 34:35.154
I don't know about
that, I'm gonna have to

34:35.155 --> 34:36.362
look into that, okay?

34:36.364 --> 34:37.197
Thank you.

34:37.197 --> 34:38.032
Somebody just called
in there saying Clark

34:38.033 --> 34:40.025
carried a guitar up there
that wasn't in his backpack.

34:40.025 --> 34:41.975
Great, let's get him down.

34:42.853 --> 34:43.804
How should we do it?

34:43.804 --> 34:44.893
Easiest way possible.

34:44.895 --> 34:46.105
Well, should we call the
press or should we just do it?

34:46.106 --> 34:48.438
Just do it, let's create some news.

34:48.438 --> 34:50.239
All right.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.692
We're going to the billboard.

34:56.786 --> 34:57.758
[Shelby] Oh my god, hi, Casey!

34:57.759 --> 34:58.788
[Casey] Hey guys.

34:58.789 --> 35:00.616
[Josh] What are youz doing up here?

35:00.617 --> 35:03.312
What's up, man, what can I do for ya?

35:03.313 --> 35:06.916
Well, I hate to do this to
you, but you're disqualified.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.197
Really?

35:08.198 --> 35:09.378
You out of your mind?

35:09.379 --> 35:10.213
I've done nothing.

35:10.214 --> 35:11.785
You gotta pack up your stuff, okay?

35:11.786 --> 35:13.022
Get going.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.573
Dude, step up, I haven't done anything.

35:14.574 --> 35:16.325
You gonna make a big deal about this?

35:16.326 --> 35:18.210
Oh yeah, he's gonna
be kickin' and screamin'

35:18.211 --> 35:19.190
like a little girl.

35:19.191 --> 35:20.428
(laughing)

35:20.429 --> 35:22.171
Dude, what did I do?

35:22.172 --> 35:23.833
[Josh] Oh, like you don't know.

35:23.834 --> 35:24.745
You carried your
guitar up here with you.

35:24.746 --> 35:26.345
Yeah, so?

35:26.346 --> 35:27.857
[Casey] It wasn't in your backpack,

35:27.858 --> 35:28.918
it's against the rules.

35:28.919 --> 35:29.840
You're busting him for that?

35:29.841 --> 35:32.775
I thought it was 'cause
he was selling drugs.

35:32.776 --> 35:35.182
Whatever, dude.

35:35.183 --> 35:38.057
It's me and two girls,
I'm gonna win, dude!

35:38.058 --> 35:38.892
(shouting)

35:38.893 --> 35:40.319
But you did know that
one of the contestants

35:40.320 --> 35:42.144
was selling drugs up on the billboard?

35:42.145 --> 35:45.069
No, we found that out
after he was disqualified,

35:45.070 --> 35:46.288
we were completely--

35:46.289 --> 35:48.508
[Interviewer] But weren't
you filming the entire time?

35:48.509 --> 35:51.501
No, actually, we have a
solar-powered video feed

35:51.502 --> 35:52.652
that's a bit shoddy, so.

35:52.653 --> 35:55.706
So you missed that you had a
drug dealer on the billboard.

35:55.707 --> 35:57.180
Yeah, unfortunately.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.450
We did.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.223
We delivered a cease and desist letter

36:04.224 --> 36:06.477
to Mr. Lindeweiler on September 1st,

36:06.478 --> 36:09.498
the day that he started his
billboard sitting contest,

36:09.499 --> 36:14.505
because he did not apply for
the appropriate zoning permits.

36:15.385 --> 36:19.060
He decided to ignore the law,
and now we have no choice

36:19.061 --> 36:22.421
but to put an end to his contest.

36:22.422 --> 36:25.343
Police Chief McLeary
and the fire department

36:25.344 --> 36:27.521
will be assisting in
getting the contestants

36:27.522 --> 36:32.527
down from the billboard by the end of day.

36:32.883 --> 36:33.717
Thank you very much for being here.

36:33.718 --> 36:37.597
What would WTYT's responsibility
be to the contestants

36:37.598 --> 36:38.549
if you're ending the contest?

36:38.550 --> 36:41.340
I don't know the rules to his contest,

36:41.341 --> 36:43.014
I simply know the laws of the city.

36:43.015 --> 36:44.323
Which zoning law is he breaking?

36:44.324 --> 36:45.638
Lindeweiler did not apply for a permit.

36:45.639 --> 36:48.057
Will he be splitting
the prize money among

36:48.058 --> 36:49.919
the three remaining contestants?

36:49.920 --> 36:51.043
You'll have to ask him
after we get them down.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.532
What permit would he have needed?

36:52.533 --> 36:53.766
Who will get the mobile home?

36:53.767 --> 36:55.284
I don't know, you'll
have to take that up

36:55.285 --> 36:56.119
with Mr. Lindeweiler.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.517
Are you worried that the polls--

36:57.518 --> 37:01.188
Will you answer my
question, Mayor Jonson?

37:08.833 --> 37:10.780
Oh, Janet, would you let it go?

37:10.781 --> 37:12.654
I mean, if he continues
to disregard the law,

37:12.655 --> 37:14.133
we're just gonna have to cut him off.

37:14.134 --> 37:16.175
What law is Mr. Lindeweiler breaking?

37:16.176 --> 37:17.987
He didn't go before the zoning committee

37:17.988 --> 37:20.229
to inquire whether or not
he could hold his contest.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.611
That wasn't my question.

37:21.612 --> 37:23.810
What law exactly is he breaking?

37:23.811 --> 37:26.876
Cindy, can you help me with this one?

37:26.877 --> 37:29.447
Well, the zoning law
states that no one can reside

37:29.448 --> 37:32.752
in a commercially-zoned property.

37:32.753 --> 37:33.587
What do you mean in?

37:33.588 --> 37:35.858
There's squatter's rights, correct?

37:35.859 --> 37:38.247
Or every homeless person
could be arrested,

37:38.248 --> 37:39.109
according to your law.

37:39.110 --> 37:42.652
Well, if the property owner
doesn't ask them to leave,

37:42.653 --> 37:44.878
they're allowed to reside there.

37:45.996 --> 37:48.662
Okay, mayor, when did
Mr. Lindeweiler ask you

37:48.663 --> 37:50.952
or the authorities to
remove the contestants

37:50.953 --> 37:53.683
from the contest he created?

37:53.684 --> 37:54.684
Mayor?

37:56.316 --> 37:58.207
Oh, oh, okay, Janet, you
got me against the ropes,

37:58.208 --> 37:59.889
and in the final round, at that.

37:59.890 --> 38:03.082
I mean, there should be some compromise.

38:03.083 --> 38:06.606
If Lindeweiler cuts the electricity

38:06.607 --> 38:09.408
to all the contestants
and stops feeding them,

38:09.409 --> 38:11.180
then they can stay.

38:11.181 --> 38:12.842
That way, according to your own research,

38:12.843 --> 38:16.485
they would indeed be squatters,
and thus could remain.

38:16.486 --> 38:17.727
So you want them to starve.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.683
Sometimes it takes a community.

38:19.684 --> 38:22.295
We need to support one another.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.137
(phone chiming)

38:26.137 --> 38:27.087
Oh, shit.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.087
[Henry] What?

38:29.620 --> 38:30.874
Read this.

38:30.875 --> 38:31.709
What's this?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.342
Now they're cutting our electricity.

38:33.343 --> 38:34.564
And we can't feed the contestants,

38:34.565 --> 38:36.375
or they're gonna shut us down.

38:36.376 --> 38:37.697
What, why would they do this?

38:37.698 --> 38:38.838
That means the feeds are gonna go down,

38:38.839 --> 38:40.409
how am I gonna know what's going on?

38:40.410 --> 38:43.162
Casey, the monitors are solar-powered.

38:43.163 --> 38:44.544
Just give me a second, I can spin this.

38:44.545 --> 38:47.156
No, we can't spin this, this is insane.

38:47.157 --> 38:49.248
We're gonna starve these people?

38:49.249 --> 38:51.621
Um, we have lawyers here from the city

38:51.622 --> 38:53.747
that need to see you now.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.999
[Henry] I'll handle it.

38:58.385 --> 38:59.723
[Jezebel] What did you do?

39:00.906 --> 39:03.491
(somber music)

40:16.013 --> 40:17.286
Ah, it's nice of you to show up.

40:17.287 --> 40:18.121
[Shelby] People are saying
you gotta stop feeding us.

40:18.122 --> 40:19.168
What happened to the electricity?

40:19.169 --> 40:20.620
Guys, listen.

40:20.621 --> 40:21.921
Yeah, I got some bad news.

40:21.922 --> 40:23.292
The city is not gonna let me

40:23.293 --> 40:24.144
give you guys anything any more.

40:24.145 --> 40:25.885
- What?
- Why youz gotta stop now?

40:25.886 --> 40:27.837
Well, it turns out I was supposed to get

40:27.838 --> 40:30.670
some sort of permit from the
zoning committee or something

40:30.671 --> 40:31.911
to let you guys live up here.

40:31.912 --> 40:33.497
We have to get down?

40:33.498 --> 40:37.096
No, no no no, it's just
that I can't, you know,

40:37.097 --> 40:39.023
feed you guys or give you water any more.

40:39.024 --> 40:40.970
Can you be a little more specific?

40:40.971 --> 40:43.212
Well, it's kinda complicated, honestly.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.047
We're not going nowhere,

40:44.048 --> 40:45.935
you got all the time in
the world to explain.

40:45.936 --> 40:47.587
Well, it was explained to me like this.

40:47.588 --> 40:49.008
You guys can stay up there,

40:49.009 --> 40:51.300
because I own the billboard, right?

40:51.301 --> 40:55.925
Only thing is, I gotta treat
you guys like you're squatters.

40:55.926 --> 40:57.751
You know, like you're homeless people.

40:59.349 --> 41:00.890
So I mean, as long as I'm okay with it,

41:00.891 --> 41:04.934
which obviously I'm fine,
you can stay up there

41:04.935 --> 41:06.616
as long as you want.

41:06.617 --> 41:09.709
It's just that I can't provide for you

41:09.710 --> 41:10.937
or I'm breaking the law.

41:10.938 --> 41:12.118
But we're still in the contest.

41:12.119 --> 41:15.424
You know, WXEN provides
for me more than youz do.

41:15.425 --> 41:17.587
Look, Josh, I didn't plan this, okay?

41:17.588 --> 41:18.662
This wasn't my doing.

41:18.663 --> 41:19.839
You just don't got a
lot of friends, do ya?

41:19.840 --> 41:21.821
It's the law, okay, what do
you want me to do about it?

41:21.822 --> 41:23.852
Okay, how am I supposed
to communicate with people

41:23.853 --> 41:25.144
if I ain't got a phone?

41:25.145 --> 41:26.698
Well, I can bring you mail.

41:26.699 --> 41:28.113
Are you serious?

41:28.114 --> 41:29.368
What, are you thinking
about getting down?

41:29.369 --> 41:30.203
Hell no.

41:30.204 --> 41:32.832
Everybody just calm down, okay?

41:32.833 --> 41:35.865
What we're gonna do is we're gonna get

41:35.866 --> 41:37.857
the community to provide
for you, you know?

41:37.858 --> 41:40.019
As long as it's not me, then
it's not breaking the law,

41:40.020 --> 41:42.011
and everybody loves you
guys, so it's gonna be easy.

41:42.012 --> 41:43.623
That doesn't even make sense.

41:43.624 --> 41:44.954
Look, if youz want us all to get down,

41:44.955 --> 41:45.789
then you gotta give us each a prize.

41:45.790 --> 41:47.727
No no no no no, I don't
want you to get down.

41:47.728 --> 41:50.043
That's the last thing
I want you to do, okay?

41:51.431 --> 41:53.033
I mean, who's gonna win the 96k?

41:53.984 --> 41:54.818
I am.

41:54.819 --> 41:56.175
Fat chance.

41:56.176 --> 41:57.067
We'll see.

41:57.068 --> 41:59.549
Hey, I'm gonna work it out, okay?

41:59.550 --> 42:01.186
Nobody's starving up there.

42:01.187 --> 42:02.271
Yeah, okay.

42:22.202 --> 42:23.322
We could create a contest like

42:23.323 --> 42:25.464
a hunger drive to support them.

42:25.465 --> 42:26.696
Fill up the truck or something.

42:26.697 --> 42:28.768
Yeah, but how do we
get the contestants food

42:28.769 --> 42:29.603
if we can't even give it to them?

42:29.604 --> 42:31.881
There's a fine line
between us being in need

42:31.882 --> 42:34.594
and actually doing something
useful for the contestants.

42:34.595 --> 42:38.278
What if we had a
contest on social media,

42:38.279 --> 42:41.120
and people go down and they take selfies

42:41.121 --> 42:43.513
with the contestants and
whoever gets the most likes

42:43.514 --> 42:44.865
or retweets wins something?

42:45.898 --> 42:46.787
Yeah, we could do that.

42:46.788 --> 42:48.037
Yeah, 'cause people would be forced to

42:48.038 --> 42:49.849
spread the word for us, and it would be

42:49.850 --> 42:50.791
helping the contestants.

42:50.792 --> 42:53.603
Yeah, we could have like, a
flashy hashtag or something.

42:53.604 --> 42:54.604
I dunno.

42:55.405 --> 42:57.196
Sure, but what do they win?

42:57.197 --> 43:00.720
That's right, bring the great WTYT 960

43:00.721 --> 43:02.360
billboard sitting contestants a snack,

43:02.361 --> 43:04.709
take a selfie at the
billboard with the hashtag

43:04.710 --> 43:08.036
support the WTYT 960 billboard sitters,

43:08.037 --> 43:11.734
share it across social
media, and you could win

43:11.735 --> 43:13.703
a WTYT billboard survival kit.

43:13.704 --> 43:17.116
[Announcer] WTYT 960, your only

43:17.117 --> 43:19.292
alternative rock AM station.

43:21.722 --> 43:22.732
[Casey] Hey, Jezebel.

43:22.733 --> 43:23.567
[Jezebel] Yeah, what's up?

43:23.568 --> 43:25.219
Can you come in here for a second?

43:25.220 --> 43:26.155
[Jezebel] Yeah, what's going on?

43:26.156 --> 43:28.592
Here, close the door.

43:28.593 --> 43:29.825
[Jezebel] What's up?

43:29.826 --> 43:31.661
Can you have a seat?

43:33.581 --> 43:35.672
[Jezebel] Is everything okay?

43:35.673 --> 43:36.507
Yeah.

43:36.507 --> 43:37.340
[Jezebel] Am I getting fired?

43:37.341 --> 43:39.028
No, no, are you kidding me, no!

43:39.029 --> 43:40.553
Okay, then why am I here?

43:40.554 --> 43:45.559
All right, actually, I have
a really stupid question.

43:45.758 --> 43:48.548
How do the advertisers know

43:48.549 --> 43:50.200
when their spots are being aired?

43:51.896 --> 43:54.824
I just don't know this stuff.

43:54.825 --> 43:55.945
It's right here.

43:55.946 --> 43:59.609
We send this at the end of
somebody's media buyout.

43:59.610 --> 44:02.211
This is their receipt, and
they have the exact time

44:02.212 --> 44:04.944
that their spot was
aired, it's very simple.

44:04.945 --> 44:06.536
Oh, cool, so we tell them.

44:06.537 --> 44:07.370
[Jezebel] Yes.

44:07.370 --> 44:08.204
Ah, cool.

44:08.205 --> 44:10.119
[Jezebel] Wait, why?

44:10.120 --> 44:11.330
No, I'm just, I'm just
learning this stuff,

44:11.331 --> 44:13.222
I'm just trying to figure it out.

44:13.223 --> 44:15.094
[Jezebel] Well, I've
gotta go on air now.

44:15.095 --> 44:16.016
Yes, sorry.

44:16.017 --> 44:18.047
So it's been something.

44:18.048 --> 44:18.882
Just one more question though,

44:18.883 --> 44:23.887
who at the station does the
scheduling for the advertisers?

44:24.290 --> 44:27.046
[Jezebel] J.C., okay?

44:27.047 --> 44:28.755
Have a great show.

44:28.756 --> 44:29.781
You look great.

44:29.782 --> 44:32.367
(door closing)

44:57.532 --> 44:59.579
[Caller] WXEN, yeah, hi.

44:59.580 --> 45:00.870
I gotta tell you, Leo, I'm a huge fan.

45:00.871 --> 45:03.072
[DJ Leo] Thanks a lot,
man, what can I do ya for?

45:03.073 --> 45:04.483
[Caller] Have you seen
what's been going on

45:04.484 --> 45:05.475
up on the billboard?

45:05.476 --> 45:07.416
[DJ Leo] No, as a
matter of fact, I haven't.

45:07.417 --> 45:09.167
Every time I've checked
their feed is down,

45:09.168 --> 45:11.651
and I just don't have
enough time on my hands

45:11.652 --> 45:13.680
to stay glued to my phone just in case

45:13.681 --> 45:16.054
we've had enough sunlight
to power their feed.

45:16.055 --> 45:18.397
Or is it a hamster in a wheel
that they use over there,

45:18.398 --> 45:19.509
is that how they do it?

45:19.510 --> 45:20.800
[Caller] Why do you
gotta be like that, man?

45:20.801 --> 45:21.702
[DJ Leo] Like what?

45:21.703 --> 45:24.833
You're the one that wants me
to talk about our competition.

45:24.834 --> 45:27.504
(phone buzzing)

45:28.889 --> 45:30.640
I believe in what you're
trying to do, man, I do.

45:30.641 --> 45:31.641
Thank you.

45:32.382 --> 45:33.382
I appreciate that.

45:34.384 --> 45:36.139
It hasn't been easy, that's for sure.

45:39.379 --> 45:41.231
Look, there's no easy way to do this.

45:43.784 --> 45:44.798
I gotta let you go.

45:45.936 --> 45:47.859
We just can't keep you
on the payroll anymore.

45:47.860 --> 45:49.517
Do you understand?

45:49.518 --> 45:51.069
The station's all I got, man.

45:52.452 --> 45:53.804
I mean, what am I gonna do?

45:55.746 --> 45:57.216
I'll give you a recommendation

45:57.217 --> 45:59.523
wherever you wanna go, all right?

46:00.510 --> 46:03.095
(somber music)

46:08.682 --> 46:11.267
(crows cawing)

46:55.414 --> 46:57.386
Your card was declined.

46:57.387 --> 46:58.387
Seriously?

47:02.302 --> 47:04.167
I'll just use the ATM, okay?

47:05.798 --> 47:06.882
Talk to me!

47:08.266 --> 47:10.690
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

47:10.691 --> 47:12.311
Casey!

47:12.312 --> 47:13.312
Casey!

47:14.740 --> 47:18.836
Oh, oh, god, Casey!

47:18.837 --> 47:19.838
What's up?

47:33.503 --> 47:37.426
Oh my god, this is, this
is the logistical nightmare

47:37.427 --> 47:38.988
I was talking about, Henry.

47:38.989 --> 47:40.981
I'm telling you, I'm psychic,

47:40.982 --> 47:42.656
I know when these things happen.

47:48.917 --> 47:49.850
(phone ringing)

47:49.851 --> 47:51.941
You're Casey, aren't you?

47:51.942 --> 47:53.199
Uh, yeah, yeah, I am.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.451
[Woman] Hi, I'm Bonnie.

47:56.019 --> 47:56.853
Nice to meet you.

47:56.854 --> 47:57.915
Can I buy you a drink?

47:57.916 --> 48:00.664
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, cool.

48:04.735 --> 48:06.261
He's not answering.

48:06.262 --> 48:07.948
[Jezebel] Boo, blurgh!

48:09.511 --> 48:11.517
(laughing)

48:11.518 --> 48:12.462
(phone ringing)

48:12.463 --> 48:14.266
We're here at Rothrock
trying to figure out

48:14.267 --> 48:16.886
what happened to billboard
sitter Ellen Snyder.

48:16.887 --> 48:19.368
A Rothrock customer came
to Miss Snyder's aid

48:19.369 --> 48:21.106
when she passed out on the billboard,

48:21.107 --> 48:23.559
according to the remaining contestants.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.041
We have been unable to--

48:25.042 --> 48:27.931
[Interviewer] And now you
have two contestants left.

48:29.920 --> 48:34.183
Well, Ellen was the next
contestant to come down,

48:34.184 --> 48:37.164
she had to leave because
of, for medical reasons.

48:37.165 --> 48:39.156
But I'm really proud of
her for staying up there

48:39.157 --> 48:40.910
as long as she did, you know?

48:40.911 --> 48:43.555
She's a real testament to what
the disabled are capable of.

48:43.556 --> 48:44.757
[Interviewer] Meaning?

48:45.626 --> 48:47.366
Just that people probably
wouldn't have thought

48:47.367 --> 48:48.768
she would have lasted as long as she did.

48:48.769 --> 48:51.020
Doesn't that sound a
little discriminatory?

48:51.021 --> 48:52.408
Did you do all this just for ratings?

48:52.409 --> 48:55.525
No, well, it's a contest,
so it's definitely--

48:55.526 --> 48:58.367
So all of this was a charade,
just trying to make a buck?

48:58.368 --> 48:59.763
No, absolutely not.

49:00.615 --> 49:02.895
I wanted to provide
something for the community,

49:02.896 --> 49:07.116
you know, and give somebody
the opportunity to get ahead,

49:07.117 --> 49:08.758
which I think is pretty
important right now.

49:08.759 --> 49:10.778
And as well as save the last independent

49:10.779 --> 49:12.722
radio station in Lehigh Valley.

49:12.723 --> 49:14.163
[Interviewer] Okay, so
this is about community,

49:14.164 --> 49:16.066
not about playing with people's lives.

49:24.895 --> 49:25.895
How is she?

49:27.858 --> 49:29.488
How's Ellen?

49:29.489 --> 49:30.323
Would you mind standing on that end

49:30.324 --> 49:32.121
of the billboard, please?

49:32.122 --> 49:33.043
Make for a better shot.

49:33.043 --> 49:34.043
Yeah, I mind.

49:34.769 --> 49:36.155
Any word on Ellen?

49:36.156 --> 49:39.418
We're here at the foot
of the WTYT 960 billboard.

49:39.419 --> 49:40.892
Tragedy struck this afternoon.

49:40.893 --> 49:42.997
One of the contestants, Ellen Snyder,

49:42.998 --> 49:44.974
was rushed to the hospital after

49:44.975 --> 49:47.446
suffering from severe dehydration.

49:47.447 --> 49:49.318
The local authorities
tried to shut it down

49:49.319 --> 49:52.411
after the station didn't get
appropriate zoning approval,

49:52.412 --> 49:54.680
but the station owner, Casey Lindeweiler,

49:54.681 --> 49:56.836
found a loophole around the law.

49:56.837 --> 49:59.178
Now we've learned that the
station isn't providing

49:59.179 --> 50:02.567
food, water, or health care
for their participants,

50:02.568 --> 50:05.649
preying on the community to
help them finish this contest

50:05.650 --> 50:08.127
just so the station can profit.

50:08.128 --> 50:10.923
To make matters worse, it
was a Rothrock customer

50:10.924 --> 50:14.013
who came to the aid of Miss Snyder.

50:14.014 --> 50:15.675
The two remaining contestants on the board

50:15.676 --> 50:17.415
didn't want to risk getting disqualified

50:17.416 --> 50:19.288
for saving her life.

50:19.289 --> 50:22.619
This billboard sitting
contest is an awful spectacle

50:22.620 --> 50:27.372
of the human condition, pitting
people against one another.

50:27.373 --> 50:28.758
[Interviewer] Have you
supplied any medical care

50:28.759 --> 50:29.949
to these contestants?

50:29.950 --> 50:30.888
They've been up there
an awfully long time.

50:30.889 --> 50:33.384
It's only been four
months, but we're certainly

50:33.385 --> 50:37.006
looking out for their
wellbeing, their health.

50:37.007 --> 50:37.841
[Interviewer] Really?

50:37.842 --> 50:40.419
Didn't Ellen Snyder come
down because of dehydration?

50:40.420 --> 50:43.292
Well, originally we
were providing them with

50:43.293 --> 50:45.896
water and food, it was actually the city

50:45.897 --> 50:49.091
that stopped allowing us from doing that.

50:49.092 --> 50:51.170
Hm, and why is that?

50:51.171 --> 50:55.819
Well, they, it was some
silly zoning code law.

50:58.669 --> 50:59.657
Hey!

50:59.657 --> 51:00.490
What?

51:00.490 --> 51:01.324
The book is out.

51:01.324 --> 51:02.312
Yeah?

51:02.313 --> 51:04.003
We're number two.

51:04.004 --> 51:05.131
Yes!

51:05.132 --> 51:07.384
(laughing)

51:08.242 --> 51:09.994
We did it, we did it!

51:16.784 --> 51:18.347
Did you see the book?

51:18.348 --> 51:19.222
[Patti] No, not yet.

51:19.223 --> 51:20.860
You gotta be kidding me.

51:20.861 --> 51:21.861
See for yourself.

51:25.346 --> 51:27.547
WXEN is still number one.

51:27.548 --> 51:28.381
Did you see this coming?

51:28.382 --> 51:30.690
[Patti] After the last trends
I pulled about a month ago?

51:30.691 --> 51:33.733
No, they'd moved up one
spot, to second last.

51:33.734 --> 51:34.994
It's just an anomaly.

51:34.995 --> 51:35.829
Let's hope so.

51:35.830 --> 51:37.527
[Patti] They're an AM station.

51:37.528 --> 51:38.398
No shit.

51:38.399 --> 51:40.329
Corporate's gonna kill me.

51:40.330 --> 51:42.381
In all my years in radio, I've never seen

51:42.382 --> 51:44.559
a station move up this fast.

51:44.560 --> 51:47.129
If we don't do something,
they'll overtake WXEN.

51:47.130 --> 51:48.898
What the hell is he doing?

51:48.899 --> 51:50.399
Paying people to tune in?

51:50.400 --> 51:51.761
Now that we know we have an audience,

51:51.762 --> 51:53.242
we should get Josh and Shelby on air

51:53.243 --> 51:54.997
saying how much they love the contest.

51:54.998 --> 51:56.786
Hey, what if we got Josh and Shelby

51:56.787 --> 51:59.118
some tablets, you know?

51:59.119 --> 52:01.775
Great idea, but how are
they gonna charge them?

52:04.590 --> 52:06.502
We could pick them
up at night, you know,

52:06.503 --> 52:09.268
charge them, drop them
back off in the morning.

52:09.269 --> 52:10.130
You're a genius!

52:10.131 --> 52:13.322
Now use that whole social media.

52:13.323 --> 52:14.157
Who would've thought
that Lindeweiler's kid

52:14.158 --> 52:16.405
could run a radio station?

52:16.406 --> 52:17.406
Nobody.

52:18.839 --> 52:21.111
Maybe we should try and
get the kid, though, huh?

52:22.492 --> 52:24.283
It won't last that much longer.

52:24.284 --> 52:25.338
Let's hope not.

52:27.698 --> 52:30.283
But maybe we can push him a little.

52:31.732 --> 52:34.043
Wait, though, we gotta
just keep this up now.

52:34.044 --> 52:35.124
We didn't just like, succeed,

52:35.125 --> 52:37.286
we gotta actually like, get the prize

52:37.287 --> 52:40.149
so that we can stay at the station,

52:40.150 --> 52:41.515
you know what I'm saying?

52:43.093 --> 52:43.927
And we will.

52:43.928 --> 52:44.951
Keep on doing what you're doing,

52:44.952 --> 52:46.111
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

52:46.112 --> 52:47.941
(laughing)

52:47.942 --> 52:48.942
Yes.

52:50.533 --> 52:51.828
Hey, guys!

52:51.829 --> 52:53.703
Day 50, you made it, huh?

52:53.704 --> 52:54.961
Congratulations!

52:54.962 --> 52:56.209
Gee, thanks.

52:57.738 --> 53:00.540
Hey, I brought you
guys a couple tablets.

53:00.541 --> 53:03.783
I figured you can send
'em down to me at night,

53:03.784 --> 53:05.915
and I'll charge 'em up, and
I'll bring 'em back to you

53:05.916 --> 53:07.367
in the morning, hoist 'em up.

53:13.033 --> 53:14.483
Hey, I put a couple of Twitter accounts

53:14.484 --> 53:16.226
on there for you guys.

53:16.227 --> 53:18.337
I figure you can keep in
contact with your fans

53:18.338 --> 53:19.639
and your friends, you know.

53:19.640 --> 53:20.490
Oh, I get it.

53:20.491 --> 53:22.532
These are so we can
promote the radio station.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.904
Don't you think it's enough
that we're up here, Casey?

53:24.905 --> 53:27.367
Really, come on, that's bullshit.

53:27.368 --> 53:30.640
Hey, I don't care what
you think, I want mine.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.606
No, look, I was just thinking you could,

53:32.607 --> 53:36.095
you know, keep in touch with
your family, that's all.

53:36.096 --> 53:37.717
Do whatever you want with 'em, Shelby.

53:37.718 --> 53:39.078
I mean, they're just presents, okay?

53:39.079 --> 53:40.940
I been thinking about your business.

53:40.941 --> 53:42.287
[Casey] Yeah?

53:42.288 --> 53:44.103
You make money selling air, don't you?

53:44.104 --> 53:48.047
Well, yeah, I mean, airtime,
but something like that.

53:48.048 --> 53:49.513
It sounds like a racket.

53:50.751 --> 53:52.648
We gotta have people
tune in for us to be,

53:52.649 --> 53:57.021
you know, successful, so we've
been in the ratings basement

53:57.022 --> 54:00.373
forever, it's not like we're, come on.

54:01.732 --> 54:03.172
You guys must be hungry, right?

54:03.173 --> 54:04.544
- Yes.
- Yes.

54:04.545 --> 54:05.902
All right, I gotta figure out a way to

54:05.903 --> 54:08.300
get you guys some food without
anybody knowing about it.

54:08.301 --> 54:09.859
We ain't gonna tell nobody.

54:09.860 --> 54:10.860
Is we, Shelby?

54:13.332 --> 54:17.920
I'll be back in an hour,
I'll get you guys something.

54:24.844 --> 54:27.514
(phone ringing)

54:31.161 --> 54:31.995
Hello?

54:31.996 --> 54:33.432
[Patti] Uh, yeah, hi,
is this Henry Lamarr?

54:33.433 --> 54:35.407
It is, and who is this?

54:35.408 --> 54:37.557
This is Patti over at Free Channel.

54:37.558 --> 54:39.288
Mr. Merrick would like
to set up a lunch date

54:39.289 --> 54:40.680
with Mr. Lindeweiler.

54:40.681 --> 54:41.515
Why?

54:41.516 --> 54:43.180
I'm not really sure why.

54:43.181 --> 54:45.384
Well, I'll see if he's available,

54:45.385 --> 54:47.841
and I'll call you at the
station if he is, okay?

55:15.966 --> 55:18.197
Hey, man, you got the beer on there too?

55:18.198 --> 55:20.149
All right, this should be cash only,

55:20.150 --> 55:23.356
I got this pending fraud
case, so, all right.

55:26.599 --> 55:28.707
This looks beautiful, man.

55:28.708 --> 55:31.961
[Clerk] Ready to roll it, good to go.

55:35.197 --> 55:37.867
(geese honking)

56:04.880 --> 56:07.587
I feel like I recognize
you, is that possible?

56:07.588 --> 56:08.667
Seen you around?

56:08.668 --> 56:09.502
[Man] I'm not sure,

56:09.503 --> 56:11.349
I don't get around these parts much.

56:11.350 --> 56:13.436
Hm, no, it'll come to me.

56:14.785 --> 56:16.135
You know, you've done
an awfully good job

56:16.136 --> 56:17.641
with WTYT, son.

56:18.488 --> 56:20.131
Thank you, yeah, it's
been a lot of hard work.

56:20.132 --> 56:22.231
Hard work and perseverance.

56:22.232 --> 56:24.263
It pays off, my man.

56:24.264 --> 56:25.225
Sure does.

56:25.225 --> 56:26.225
[Waiter] Sir.

56:27.558 --> 56:29.468
Ah, let Clarence taste.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.538
Sir, the bottle of Chateau Potelle.

56:31.539 --> 56:33.673
VGS chardonnay, 2013.

56:33.674 --> 56:34.674
VGS.

56:35.576 --> 56:37.456
Clare, you know what VGS stands for?

56:37.457 --> 56:38.291
No.

56:38.292 --> 56:39.322
Very good shit.

56:40.430 --> 56:41.781
But taste it anyway just to make sure

56:41.782 --> 56:43.386
it was stored properly.

56:57.317 --> 56:59.673
Ah, yeah, that's great.

57:01.481 --> 57:03.033
It's my first time trying shit.

57:10.751 --> 57:12.962
So why am I here?

57:12.963 --> 57:14.264
I have an offer for you.

57:18.128 --> 57:18.962
[Casey] What is this?

57:18.962 --> 57:19.962
[Rick] Look inside.

57:23.110 --> 57:25.028
We'd like to buy your station.

57:30.460 --> 57:31.996
I'm sorry, sir, it's not for sale.

57:31.997 --> 57:33.617
(chuckling) Kid.

57:35.035 --> 57:36.766
That's the most anyone will ever pay you

57:36.767 --> 57:39.242
for a station in this market.

57:40.320 --> 57:44.267
You could retire, go back
to your comic book shit.

57:48.308 --> 57:50.834
Well, no offense, Mr. Merrick, was it?

57:52.257 --> 57:53.759
But you can go screw yourself.

57:56.527 --> 57:59.408
I own the only independent
station left in this town,

57:59.409 --> 58:01.249
and I would rather run it into the ground

58:01.250 --> 58:03.106
than let you buy my father's station.

58:03.984 --> 58:06.656
And although my father
wasn't as good a businessman

58:06.657 --> 58:08.758
as yourself, he was a far
better man than you and I

58:08.759 --> 58:10.227
will ever be, so why
don't you take your check

58:10.228 --> 58:11.845
and wipe your ass with it?

58:23.411 --> 58:24.958
How much did he offer you?

58:29.269 --> 58:30.230
Three million dollars.

58:30.231 --> 58:32.221
Casey, are you serious?

58:32.222 --> 58:33.222
[Casey] Yeah.

58:34.084 --> 58:35.418
[Henry] And what did you say?

58:36.950 --> 58:39.302
I told him to go wipe
his ass with his check.

58:40.310 --> 58:43.315
That I own the only independent
station left in this town

58:43.316 --> 58:46.335
and I'm gonna keep it that way.

58:46.336 --> 58:47.838
You have some serious balls.

58:49.369 --> 58:50.544
So stupid.

58:52.099 --> 58:52.943
But thank you.

58:52.944 --> 58:54.463
[DJ] This weekend, it's trick or treat

58:54.464 --> 58:55.919
for all the little kiddies in the valley,

58:55.920 --> 58:59.522
and the big Allentown Halloween
Parade is this Sunday.

58:59.523 --> 59:00.801
Tomorrow, what are you going to wear

59:00.802 --> 59:03.713
as you pelt the crowd with Dum-Dums?

59:03.714 --> 59:06.135
[Tamara] I was thinking
of a sexy scarecrow.

59:06.136 --> 59:08.017
[DJ] Oh yeah, how sexy?

59:08.018 --> 59:10.339
[Tamara] Sexy enough to
land the station in trouble.

59:10.340 --> 59:12.251
[DJ] Is this a rehash
of the stunt you pulled

59:12.252 --> 59:14.994
for our XXX contest
that got us in hot water

59:14.995 --> 59:16.115
with Rick Merrick?

59:16.116 --> 59:18.357
[Tamara] Deep down, you
know he liked what he saw.

59:18.358 --> 59:19.199
[DJ] Well, I'm sure he did.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.940
Speaking of our XXX contest,

59:20.941 --> 59:22.577
I wonder how our big winner Josh Richards

59:22.578 --> 59:24.804
is doing over at the billboard squat?

59:24.805 --> 59:26.365
Anyone been by lately?

59:26.366 --> 59:27.406
[Tamara] Beats me.

59:27.407 --> 59:29.819
Josh just keeps begging for food.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.693
[DJ] Is the parade
route going anywhere near

59:31.694 --> 59:33.262
the billboard squat?

59:33.263 --> 59:36.139
[Tamara] Hmm, let me check.

59:36.140 --> 59:38.795
No, looks like another day without food

59:38.796 --> 59:42.230
for the WTYT billboard squatters.

59:42.231 --> 59:44.159
Hey, how you guys doing?

59:44.160 --> 59:46.149
I brought you guys some burgers.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.928
You know, I been thinkin'.

59:49.929 --> 59:52.812
How do we know you got
the money to pay us?

59:52.813 --> 59:53.647
What do you mean?

59:53.648 --> 59:55.006
Of course we got the money.

59:55.007 --> 59:56.643
You said you was in
the ratings basement.

59:56.644 --> 59:58.425
You show me some bank
statements that shows me

59:58.426 --> 59:59.979
that you got the money to pay us.

59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.775
And if youz got money, I'll stay,

01:00:01.776 --> 01:00:03.553
but if you don't, I'm gettin' down.

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:04.854
All right.

01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:06.996
Hey, what you guys don't know about

01:00:06.997 --> 01:00:08.508
is we've been number two in the ratings

01:00:08.509 --> 01:00:10.269
for like two months, we're doing great.

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:11.104
Everybody loves you guys.

01:00:11.105 --> 01:00:12.181
Show me the proof.

01:00:12.182 --> 01:00:14.307
What about the tablets
I gave you guys, right?

01:00:14.308 --> 01:00:17.016
Lower 'em down, I'll
charge 'em up for you.

01:00:17.017 --> 01:00:19.308
I don't want anything to
do with them nasty people

01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:20.379
saying nasty things about
us, they don't even know us.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.121
What are they saying?

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:23.391
You don't even wanna know.

01:00:23.392 --> 01:00:24.754
Come on, it's the internet.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.226
They got trolls and haters,
don't worry about it.

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:28.738
I didn't sign up for any of that stuff.

01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:29.829
What if my Emmy sees that?

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:32.572
You're living on a billboard.

01:00:32.573 --> 01:00:33.833
Show me the proof!

01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:35.045
I will, I will.

01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:40.306
(tent unzipping)

01:00:44.448 --> 01:00:47.034
(somber music)

01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:22.285
[Interviewer] You feel powerful,

01:01:22.286 --> 01:01:24.580
controlling the destiny of others?

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:25.629
No, not at all.

01:01:27.529 --> 01:01:30.900
I mean, the contestants are
free to quit at any time.

01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:31.872
[Interviewer] But are they?

01:01:31.873 --> 01:01:32.992
I mean, one's a starving artist

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:36.025
and the other can't even
provide for his own children.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.888
Josh only has one child,

01:01:37.889 --> 01:01:40.890
and I'm pretty sure he's doing okay.

01:01:40.891 --> 01:01:42.971
[Interviewer] We've heard
that his wife's pregnant.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.844
Well, I'll be.

01:01:55.576 --> 01:01:57.366
Mr. Casey, you're almost a millionaire.

01:01:57.367 --> 01:01:59.898
Well, my father took care of me.

01:01:59.899 --> 01:02:01.975
[Josh] And I'm gonna
do the same for my Emmy.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.729
[Ronny] WTYT 960, the
fastest-growing station

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:20.974
in the Lehigh Valley.

01:02:22.266 --> 01:02:23.442
Hello.

01:02:23.443 --> 01:02:24.443
Hey.

01:02:28.814 --> 01:02:29.815
What's up?

01:02:33.223 --> 01:02:34.223
We're down.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.659
How is that even possible?

01:02:42.397 --> 01:02:43.745
Where are we at?

01:02:43.746 --> 01:02:44.914
We're fifth.

01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:49.028
We've been doing all this cool stuff,

01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:53.883
getting people to hashtag
and all that jazz.

01:02:53.884 --> 01:02:56.425
Living on a billboard is boring.

01:02:56.426 --> 01:02:58.048
It's like watching grass grow.

01:03:02.726 --> 01:03:06.045
(sighing) What do I do?

01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:08.573
Well, I noticed that
every time something crazy

01:03:08.574 --> 01:03:11.090
or something exciting,
something wild happens,

01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:13.266
that listenership seems to spike.

01:03:17.618 --> 01:03:19.899
[DJ] The heavily contested
mayoral race in Allentown

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.772
is heating up after a
knockdown debate last night.

01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:24.844
Contender Elaine Di Bella seems to have

01:03:24.845 --> 01:03:27.502
knocked Mayor Jonson off
his perch at city hall,

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.519
after a number of exchanges regarding

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.121
WTYT's billboard sitting contest

01:03:32.122 --> 01:03:34.884
and the mayor's ill
handling of the contest.

01:03:34.885 --> 01:03:37.054
Why is the contest allowed to continue?

01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:39.869
Why was it even allowed to
start in the first place?

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:43.273
Sounds like the mayor is
deep into WTYT's pockets.

01:03:45.345 --> 01:03:47.040
[Josh] Come back here, you cowards!

01:03:55.816 --> 01:03:58.347
Let me tell you folks,
we are shocked and outraged

01:03:58.348 --> 01:03:59.792
that some people would put the lives of

01:03:59.793 --> 01:04:02.071
our contestants in jeopardy,

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:05.371
while others would deface our billboard.

01:04:05.372 --> 01:04:07.958
(somber music)

01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.166
Hello, Casey, how are you?

01:05:05.725 --> 01:05:07.560
It's nice to meet you.

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:42.762
[DJ] They've become a human spectacle,

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:45.915
more fitted for the Lehigh
Valley Zoo than a radio contest.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:47.677
At least the zoo would feed them.

01:06:47.678 --> 01:06:50.302
The host of the billboard
contest, Casey Linde-whatever,

01:06:50.303 --> 01:06:51.914
should be ashamed of himself for profiting

01:06:51.915 --> 01:06:53.332
off people who lack the brainpower

01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:55.354
to make a decent decision.

01:06:55.355 --> 01:06:56.776
I wonder how much money he's made

01:06:56.777 --> 01:06:58.938
not providing for his contestants.

01:06:58.939 --> 01:07:00.479
Is this some sort of scheme with the city

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.771
so he can profit?

01:07:01.772 --> 01:07:03.402
It smells like something fishy going on.

01:07:03.403 --> 01:07:05.324
Is collusion the new thing?

01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.256
I would love to hear the
thoughts of our listeners.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:08.588
The Free Channel has gone negative,

01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:10.947
trying to get the public
to turn against us.

01:07:10.948 --> 01:07:11.971
So now they're at us?

01:07:11.972 --> 01:07:12.972
Yeah.

01:07:13.724 --> 01:07:15.234
How are they getting their information?

01:07:15.235 --> 01:07:17.000
Josh and Shelby's social media.

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.179
All right, let's go back at them.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.014
Let's go back at them?

01:07:23.015 --> 01:07:25.508
They have 20 times more
listenership than we do.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.470
They have 11 stations to our one.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:32.852
Well, let's get these tablets out of

01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:34.594
these stupid contestants'
hands, all right?

01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:36.346
We need to control the information.

01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:39.118
Seriously?

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:41.040
Do you hear yourself, are
you listening to yourself?

01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:42.716
Yes, I'm listening to myself.

01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:45.254
Find some money.

01:07:45.255 --> 01:07:47.107
I'm doing my job, what are you doing?

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:51.765
You know, I'm gonna step away from you

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:53.943
before I say something I'm gonna regret.

01:07:53.944 --> 01:07:55.765
You already did, good job.

01:07:55.766 --> 01:07:56.817
You're great at that.

01:07:59.824 --> 01:08:01.929
You're turning into one of them, Casey!

01:08:05.635 --> 01:08:06.786
I'm sorry, all right?

01:08:09.015 --> 01:08:11.184
(sighing)

01:08:13.153 --> 01:08:14.988
This job is my life.

01:08:16.687 --> 01:08:17.687
It's a paycheck.

01:08:24.545 --> 01:08:26.196
I have one more thing I can do.

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:28.082
What do ya got?

01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:29.832
[Henry] I have some friends at MSN.

01:08:34.453 --> 01:08:35.453
Call 'em up.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.209
A billboard sitting
contest has cast a spotlight

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.654
on what used to be a poor, depressed town

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.617
in search of an identity
that was crushed by a song.

01:08:47.618 --> 01:08:49.899
It has become a tale of two cities,

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.930
the haves and the have-nots.

01:08:51.932 --> 01:08:54.584
Independent radio against corporate radio.

01:08:54.585 --> 01:08:57.484
Building community and being a lone wolf.

01:08:57.484 --> 01:09:00.368
Late this past summer, a
struggling entrepreneur,

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:03.192
Casey Lindeweiler, began a
contest where four people

01:09:03.193 --> 01:09:05.425
would live on a catwalk
in front of a billboard

01:09:05.426 --> 01:09:09.087
to win $96,000 and a mobile home.

01:09:09.089 --> 01:09:11.080
75 days later.

01:09:11.081 --> 01:09:13.622
I'm sure that you've
reaped considerable benefits

01:09:13.624 --> 01:09:15.294
and profits from this contest.

01:09:15.295 --> 01:09:16.417
No, absolutely not, that couldn't be

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:18.037
farther from the truth.

01:09:18.037 --> 01:09:20.019
You know, when I inherited this station,

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.292
it was drowning in debt, so
we're still just scraping by.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.948
[Interviewer] And all of
this just to win a mobile home?

01:09:26.943 --> 01:09:29.636
Yeah, and $96,000.

01:09:29.638 --> 01:09:31.432
After this commercial
break, we'll take questions

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.221
and comments from our audience.

01:09:33.223 --> 01:09:34.844
Stick with us.

01:09:34.845 --> 01:09:36.345
You're doing great, excellent.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:41.992
[Man] Channel three, Mark Morris.

01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:44.173
Hey, Mark, it's Rick
over at Free Channel.

01:09:44.174 --> 01:09:45.828
[Mark] Hey, Rick, how the hell you been?

01:09:45.828 --> 01:09:47.225
What can I do you for?

01:09:47.227 --> 01:09:48.688
Yeah, some storm we're having, huh?

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.872
[Mark] Yeah, real nor'easter,
it's pretty bad out there.

01:09:50.874 --> 01:09:53.774
Any idea how those people up
on that billboard are doing?

01:09:53.774 --> 01:09:55.100
[Mark] I didn't give it much thought.

01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:56.352
Why do you ask?

01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:04.283
The winds are beginning to turn against

01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:07.977
Lehigh Valley radio station WTYT 960.

01:10:07.978 --> 01:10:10.126
Now that winter is upon
us, it doesn't seem like

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:12.762
the station has a plan for
the contestants' welfare

01:10:12.763 --> 01:10:14.347
in the billboard sitting contest.

01:10:14.348 --> 01:10:18.287
We asked station owner Casey
Lindeweiler of his intentions.

01:10:18.288 --> 01:10:19.982
Mr. Lindeweiler, what are your plans

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:22.447
for the billboard contest this winter?

01:10:22.448 --> 01:10:24.926
Just that we continue
to be as successful

01:10:24.927 --> 01:10:26.697
as we've been so far.

01:10:26.698 --> 01:10:28.400
And what will you
provide the contestants

01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:30.259
in sub-freezing weather?

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.552
Well, unfortunately only
what the city will allow us,

01:10:32.553 --> 01:10:35.306
which is nothing, so thanks for coming by.

01:10:35.307 --> 01:10:37.969
[Reporter] Mr. Lindeweiler.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:40.556
(somber music)

01:11:36.936 --> 01:11:38.629
[Casey] Unfortunately, only
what the city will allow us,

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:40.075
which is nothing.

01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:41.399
Thanks for coming by.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.252
What in the hell were you thinking?

01:11:43.253 --> 01:11:45.556
They completely butchered
what I was saying.

01:11:47.688 --> 01:11:50.650
That made us look really, really bad.

01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:51.660
Like you don't care about them.

01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.792
You know that's not true.

01:11:52.793 --> 01:11:54.824
The lame duck mayor will do nothing.

01:11:54.825 --> 01:11:56.455
City council will do nothing.

01:11:56.456 --> 01:11:58.237
What more can the community do

01:11:58.238 --> 01:12:00.299
to try and end the
billboard sitting contest?

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.091
[Crowd] Quit, quit the billboard sit!

01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:04.697
Stop the insanity, where's the humanity!

01:12:04.698 --> 01:12:06.338
Quit, quit the billboard sit!

01:12:06.339 --> 01:12:08.144
[Reporter] Protestors
are picketing at the foot

01:12:08.145 --> 01:12:12.942
of the billboard and outside
the WTYT 960 radio station,

01:12:12.943 --> 01:12:14.574
protesting the station's treatment

01:12:14.575 --> 01:12:16.019
of their billboard sitters.

01:12:17.988 --> 01:12:19.809
I told you, the press are provocateurs.

01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:20.850
English, please.

01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:22.015
Liars.

01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:25.054
(phone chiming)

01:12:25.055 --> 01:12:27.346
This is totally out of control.

01:12:27.347 --> 01:12:30.840
We just have to go on
like it's business as usual.

01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:34.022
Do what we've always done,
just ride it and spin it.

01:12:34.023 --> 01:12:35.625
The truth will work its way out.

01:12:37.004 --> 01:12:39.797
Yeah, but how much
damage control can we do?

01:12:39.798 --> 01:12:42.481
The sponsors are gonna start
pulling their ads immediately.

01:12:42.482 --> 01:12:43.784
[Ronny] Already started.

01:12:46.677 --> 01:12:47.568
[Reporter] When will it end?

01:12:47.569 --> 01:12:49.646
People are becoming outraged that

01:12:49.647 --> 01:12:54.443
the WTYT billboard contest
has been allowed to continue.

01:12:54.444 --> 01:12:55.822
Well, obviously those people up there

01:12:55.823 --> 01:12:57.977
don't have any common sense.

01:12:57.978 --> 01:12:59.148
They are determined, aren't they?

01:12:59.149 --> 01:13:01.811
The station oughta give
them a heater or something.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:03.803
Are these contestants that destitute

01:13:03.804 --> 01:13:05.334
that they need to live on a billboard

01:13:05.335 --> 01:13:07.346
in the middle of winter, or are they just

01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:08.671
starved for attention like the man

01:13:08.672 --> 01:13:11.911
hosting the contest, Casey Lindeweiler?

01:13:11.912 --> 01:13:13.793
How low can he go?

01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:15.935
Is he desperate, does
he have a god complex,

01:13:15.936 --> 01:13:17.837
or is he an attention-starved businessman

01:13:17.838 --> 01:13:20.239
exploiting others for his personal gain?

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.715
Shame on you, Mr.
Lindeweiler, shame on you.

01:13:22.716 --> 01:13:23.550
[Reporter] So how do you
feel about shutting down

01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:24.984
this billboard sitting contest?

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.481
There's nothing I can do.

01:13:26.482 --> 01:13:28.101
They're on private property,

01:13:28.102 --> 01:13:30.229
and property owners have rights.

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:33.661
The next administration will
have to do as they see fit.

01:13:33.662 --> 01:13:36.247
(somber music)

01:13:46.478 --> 01:13:47.312
[Tamara] Seriously, guys,

01:13:47.313 --> 01:13:49.238
a community-implemented hunger strike?

01:13:49.239 --> 01:13:51.165
We need to rise above this, people.

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:54.023
It's the freakin' holidays, don't let WTYT

01:13:54.024 --> 01:13:54.858
bring the community down.

01:13:54.859 --> 01:13:57.486
Take it easy, Tamara, just
step away from the ledge,

01:13:57.487 --> 01:13:58.923
just step away.

01:13:58.924 --> 01:14:00.299
People can be so cruel.

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.812
They're up there under
their own volition.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:07.036
The billboard outside
the WTYT 960 radio station,

01:14:07.037 --> 01:14:08.658
protesting the station's treatment

01:14:08.659 --> 01:14:10.259
of their billboard sitters.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.552
Station owner Casey Lindeweiler isn't

01:14:12.553 --> 01:14:14.984
providing his contestants any relief,

01:14:14.985 --> 01:14:16.982
despite the freezing temperatures.

01:14:16.983 --> 01:14:18.628
People are becoming
outraged that the contest

01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:20.493
has been allowed to continue.

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:50.624
You're Casey Lindeweiler.

01:14:52.423 --> 01:14:54.938
Yep, yep, that's me.

01:14:55.846 --> 01:14:57.848
How could you do that to those people?

01:14:59.022 --> 01:15:01.731
How can you even live with yourself?

01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:03.743
The contestants are free
to leave at any moment, okay,

01:15:03.744 --> 01:15:06.183
I'm not forcing them to stay there.

01:15:08.649 --> 01:15:09.833
You're an asshole.

01:15:11.792 --> 01:15:14.477
Yeah, and you believe everything
that you see, don't you?

01:15:30.121 --> 01:15:32.791
(phone ringing)

01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:45.004
Hey, what's up?

01:15:45.005 --> 01:15:45.996
Well, I just got a call asking

01:15:45.997 --> 01:15:47.948
if you wanted to be on Wake Up America.

01:15:48.869 --> 01:15:49.913
Wake Up America?

01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:52.371
[Henry] Yes.

01:15:53.183 --> 01:15:54.494
Why?

01:15:54.495 --> 01:15:56.848
They want to interview
you about the contest.

01:15:58.218 --> 01:15:59.820
Look, you need to clear the air.

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:03.343
Remember, you're doing a good thing.

01:16:04.545 --> 01:16:05.865
Just make people believe that.

01:16:05.866 --> 01:16:10.219
Uh, all right, what time
do they want me there?

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.826
[Henry] Uh, they want you
there at one, that's okay?

01:16:16.396 --> 01:16:18.387
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:18.388 --> 01:16:21.114
Just text me the address, I'll be there.

01:16:22.019 --> 01:16:23.020
[Henry] All right.

01:16:25.155 --> 01:16:26.155
Thanks, Henry.

01:16:27.026 --> 01:16:28.194
[Henry] Bye.

01:16:40.883 --> 01:16:43.886
(sighing) Oh man.

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:46.646
Welcome back to Wake Up America.

01:16:46.647 --> 01:16:48.878
We've been joined today
by Casey Lindeweiler.

01:16:48.879 --> 01:16:52.602
He's the creator of the WTYT
billboard sitting contest.

01:16:52.603 --> 01:16:53.991
We've got a live studio audience here,

01:16:53.992 --> 01:16:55.785
and they've got some questions.

01:16:55.786 --> 01:16:57.056
Sir?

01:16:57.057 --> 01:16:59.991
How much money did you
make exploiting these people?

01:16:59.992 --> 01:17:01.367
What do you have to
say about that, Casey?

01:17:01.368 --> 01:17:03.272
I mean, with all due respect, sir,

01:17:03.273 --> 01:17:06.726
I don't ask you your income,
why should I tell you mine?

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:07.747
[Interviewer] Yeah, but
we've got your ad rates

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.849
right here, and you've said this contest

01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:11.903
has been going on for,
what, four months now?

01:17:11.904 --> 01:17:13.362
Yeah.

01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:16.095
Okay, so let's take your
lowest ad rate per week,

01:17:16.096 --> 01:17:20.229
multiply it by 16, and you've
got, what, a million dollars?

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:21.064
That's not true.

01:17:21.065 --> 01:17:22.562
What about the FCC,
are you worried about

01:17:22.563 --> 01:17:25.054
the fines they may bring down
on you for double-dipping,

01:17:25.055 --> 01:17:27.086
you know, charging
double for your ad space?

01:17:27.087 --> 01:17:28.885
What are you talking about,
that's not true at all.

01:17:28.886 --> 01:17:30.969
That's what our sources have told us.

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:34.664
Why are you trying to make
me look like I'm the bad guy?

01:17:34.665 --> 01:17:36.115
You know why, because
a good guy wouldn't

01:17:36.116 --> 01:17:38.112
be taking advantage of people like this.

01:17:38.113 --> 01:17:40.347
You know, all around the
world there are contests

01:17:40.348 --> 01:17:44.465
that are driving up ratings,
it's a pretty common practice.

01:17:44.466 --> 01:17:46.195
Nothing like this.

01:17:46.196 --> 01:17:47.917
Well, maybe that's
because it's so original.

01:17:47.918 --> 01:17:49.346
You have no idea what I had to risk

01:17:49.347 --> 01:17:51.247
to try to save this station.

01:17:51.248 --> 01:17:53.716
You know, I wish you were
asking me questions like that.

01:17:53.717 --> 01:17:55.518
I mean, we're still drowning in debt.

01:17:55.519 --> 01:17:57.313
Yeah, like most
Americans, but they're not

01:17:57.314 --> 01:18:00.179
taking advantage of people
to pay off their debts.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.981
Don't you think it's
time to end this contest?

01:18:01.982 --> 01:18:03.830
Quit pretending to be
something that you're not.

01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:06.185
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:07.363
End this contest.

01:18:07.364 --> 01:18:08.778
End this contest.

01:18:08.779 --> 01:18:12.041
You should give them
both the money, and a home.

01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:16.435
End this contest, end the
contest, end the contest!

01:18:16.436 --> 01:18:19.322
End the contest, end the
contest, end the contest,

01:18:19.323 --> 01:18:23.494
end the contest, end the
contest, end the contest!

01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:28.238
[Interviewer] Do you
have a response to this?

01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:30.740
I was just trying to do
something good for the community.

01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:32.793
We need to take a break, we'll be back.

01:18:41.957 --> 01:18:44.944
Mr. Lindeweiler, are you okay?

01:18:44.945 --> 01:18:47.837
Casey, Mr. Lindeweiler?

01:18:47.838 --> 01:18:48.798
Yeah.

01:18:48.799 --> 01:18:51.290
[Assistant] Are you okay?

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:52.652
Yeah.

01:18:52.653 --> 01:18:54.007
[Assistant] You're doing good.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.404
Yeah, thanks for that.

01:19:02.402 --> 01:19:04.519
[Interviewer] Wait,
wait, Mr. Lindeweiler!

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.105
(mellow music)

01:19:34.034 --> 01:19:35.179
Henry.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:40.131
[Henry] In here.

01:19:40.132 --> 01:19:41.547
You set me up, didn't you?

01:19:41.548 --> 01:19:42.381
What?

01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:43.215
You set me up.

01:19:43.215 --> 01:19:44.049
What are you talking about?

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:46.075
I just went on national
television and got destroyed,

01:19:46.076 --> 01:19:47.473
so what did you say?

01:19:47.474 --> 01:19:49.258
I really don't know what
you're talking about right now.

01:19:49.259 --> 01:19:50.920
Were you not watching?

01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:51.772
What are you doing?

01:19:51.773 --> 01:19:53.372
Why are advertisers calling

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:55.498
asking to see the traffic reports?

01:19:57.437 --> 01:19:59.438
Because somebody in our office told them

01:19:59.439 --> 01:20:00.810
that we're double booking our ads.

01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:02.291
Well, are we double booking?

01:20:02.292 --> 01:20:03.603
No!

01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:05.154
Then where are the receipts?

01:20:05.155 --> 01:20:06.302
I don't know, where
are the receipts, Henry?

01:20:06.303 --> 01:20:07.677
[Henry] You tell me, I don't know.

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.068
Where are the receipts, Jezebel?

01:20:09.069 --> 01:20:10.655
What's going on?

01:20:10.656 --> 01:20:13.052
You need to watch your tone.

01:20:13.053 --> 01:20:14.014
Get outta here.

01:20:14.014 --> 01:20:14.848
[Henry] Casey.

01:20:14.848 --> 01:20:15.716
Get outta my face.

01:20:15.716 --> 01:20:16.550
[Jezebel] Really?

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.447
Yes.

01:20:17.448 --> 01:20:19.909
Oh, your dad would be so proud of you,

01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:21.330
so proud, sonny boy.

01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:22.642
Go home, go home.

01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:24.648
I'm done, I quit.

01:20:26.957 --> 01:20:28.427
Casey, what are you doing?

01:20:28.428 --> 01:20:29.419
Who's gonna cover for her?

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.263
I will cover for her,
you can cover for her.

01:20:31.264 --> 01:20:32.512
Casey, have you lost your mind?

01:20:32.513 --> 01:20:34.696
No, you think people listen for her?

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:35.755
Hey, what's wrong with Jez?

01:20:35.756 --> 01:20:37.655
What, just go home, dude, just,

01:20:37.656 --> 01:20:39.559
can you do your job, maybe?

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.460
Why are you talking to me like that?

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:42.091
[Casey] Just get outta here, all right?

01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:42.926
[Ronny] Get outta here?

01:20:42.927 --> 01:20:43.963
Yes, go home.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:44.955
What, are you gonna like, fire me?

01:20:44.956 --> 01:20:46.475
Yes, I'm gonna fire you, Ronny.

01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:49.679
Go, go play with your
computer or whatever.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.020
You know what, this guy's a jackass,

01:20:51.021 --> 01:20:52.168
and if you stand next to him,

01:20:52.169 --> 01:20:54.073
then good luck with
that, you're a jackass.

01:20:54.074 --> 01:20:55.414
They're the reason we have listeners.

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:56.773
They've been here way
longer than you have.

01:20:56.774 --> 01:20:57.807
- They're the reason?
- Yes.

01:20:57.808 --> 01:20:59.209
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:21:00.109 --> 01:21:02.131
This radio station was
dead before I came here.

01:21:02.132 --> 01:21:04.483
The only reason anything
happened is because

01:21:04.484 --> 01:21:07.587
I started a billboard contest
to save the radio station.

01:21:07.588 --> 01:21:10.023
Do you remember, we're trying
to save the radio station?

01:21:10.861 --> 01:21:12.061
What are you doing?

01:21:12.062 --> 01:21:14.143
I'm leaving, this is all about you.

01:21:14.144 --> 01:21:15.575
Good, go, I don't need you.

01:21:15.576 --> 01:21:16.576
Get outta here.

01:21:18.318 --> 01:21:19.319
I believed in you.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.050
(door slamming)

01:21:37.827 --> 01:21:42.832
What the fuck.

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:48.338
(sighing)

01:22:05.848 --> 01:22:07.750
Why did you leave me with such a mess?

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.224
What's wrong with you?

01:22:21.962 --> 01:22:22.962
Dammit!

01:22:24.348 --> 01:22:26.684
(screaming)

01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:31.616
(sobbing)

01:22:33.038 --> 01:22:35.624
(somber music)

01:23:03.163 --> 01:23:06.275
Mr. Lindeweiler will
be reading a statement.

01:23:06.276 --> 01:23:09.989
Any other questions, please
submit them to my office.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.990
Casey?

01:23:16.687 --> 01:23:21.310
On day 103, I'm here to announce the end

01:23:21.311 --> 01:23:22.796
of the billboard contest.

01:23:23.935 --> 01:23:25.104
I'm very proud of our contestants

01:23:25.105 --> 01:23:27.136
for lasting as long as they did,

01:23:27.137 --> 01:23:29.368
and I want to take the time to thank

01:23:29.369 --> 01:23:31.294
our advertisers and sponsors.

01:23:33.063 --> 01:23:35.174
The contestants will be
receiving mobile homes

01:23:35.175 --> 01:23:37.294
and splitting $96,000.

01:23:37.295 --> 01:23:41.404
Casey, why not just
give them both $96,000?

01:23:44.314 --> 01:23:45.959
Because that's all we have.

01:23:48.609 --> 01:23:50.611
I really did try to help this community,

01:23:52.933 --> 01:23:56.319
and save my father's station,
but I guess I failed.

01:23:59.269 --> 01:24:01.661
Um, thanks to everybody who supported us,

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.001
and thank you all for coming.

01:24:05.435 --> 01:24:07.006
- Casey!
- Wait, Casey!

01:24:07.007 --> 01:24:08.314
No more questions, any other questions

01:24:08.315 --> 01:24:10.570
should be directed to my office.

01:24:10.571 --> 01:24:12.322
- Casey!
- Casey, just talk to us!

01:24:21.079 --> 01:24:23.749
(flies buzzing)

01:24:48.238 --> 01:24:49.072
What's your name?

01:24:49.072 --> 01:24:49.906
[Woman] Adriana.

01:24:49.906 --> 01:24:50.906
Adriana, cool.

01:24:54.205 --> 01:24:55.039
Thanks for coming by.

01:24:55.039 --> 01:24:56.039
Thank you.

01:24:57.788 --> 01:24:58.622
Hey, how are you doing?

01:24:58.623 --> 01:25:01.154
Hey, can I ask you a couple
questions about your book?

01:25:03.033 --> 01:25:05.034
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

01:25:05.035 --> 01:25:07.777
So it ends with where are they now.

01:25:07.778 --> 01:25:10.730
Do you have any regrets as
to how the contest ended?

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:12.261
All the contestants are better off now

01:25:12.262 --> 01:25:13.797
than they were before, so.

01:25:15.756 --> 01:25:16.756
Are you?

01:25:21.852 --> 01:25:26.656
Um, I wish I handled
myself in a different way,

01:25:26.657 --> 01:25:29.693
but you know, you live and learn, so.

01:25:31.211 --> 01:25:34.133
I tried, I didn't really have business

01:25:34.134 --> 01:25:37.637
running a radio station to
begin with, and I failed,

01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:40.964
so now I'll try to do something else.

01:25:40.965 --> 01:25:41.799
To some, it looks like you're still

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.667
trying to profit off the contest.

01:25:45.696 --> 01:25:48.227
I don't really care
what other people think.

01:25:48.228 --> 01:25:50.159
You know, I know what's true.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Do you?

01:26:01.133 --> 01:26:02.133
Hi.

01:26:03.053 --> 01:26:05.472
(rock music)

01:26:17.795 --> 01:26:19.797
Hi, visit wtyt960.com.

01:26:23.668 --> 01:26:25.668
No one said anything about streaming us.

01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:26.957
You mean we's on the internet?

01:26:26.958 --> 01:26:29.569
A little late for that, toots.

01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:30.620
Hey!

01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:31.621
Emily!

01:26:32.299 --> 01:26:34.719
(rock music)

01:26:55.485 --> 01:26:57.216
I wonder how they're streaming it.

01:26:57.217 --> 01:26:58.318
I wonder if it's live?

01:27:09.171 --> 01:27:10.673
No, up to my toes.

01:27:36.656 --> 01:27:38.668
How are we gonna be able to practice?

01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:40.259
I'll be able to throw down just fine.

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.612
Hey, Jack, the cable.

01:27:42.879 --> 01:27:44.712
[Jack] I didn't bring
it, dude, I'm sorry.

01:27:44.713 --> 01:27:45.547
What?

01:27:45.548 --> 01:27:50.552
I didn't bring it.

01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:55.743
(laughing)

01:28:00.355 --> 01:28:01.560
Why don't you just chill out?

01:28:01.561 --> 01:28:03.230
[Clark] Oh, she speaks!

01:28:03.231 --> 01:28:06.985
I'm sick of you running
around like idiots.

01:28:09.019 --> 01:28:11.129
Well, I do what I
want whenever I want to.

01:28:11.130 --> 01:28:13.382
Yeah, I bet you do, dick.

01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:18.982
It's nice to know all
that stuff Daddy left you.

01:28:20.164 --> 01:28:23.030
(laughing)

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:25.815
He probably didn't leave
it all at the road anyway.

01:28:25.816 --> 01:28:27.931
Why wouldn't they bring
it into the parking lot?

01:28:29.235 --> 01:28:30.560
Hey, you did get a spike.

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:31.999
Shut up before I make you.
