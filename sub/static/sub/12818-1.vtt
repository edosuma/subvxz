<i>Show me the side
streets in your life</i>

00:44.282 --> 00:50.887
<i>Train yards like bone
yards sharpened knives</i>

00:54.025 --> 01:00.295
<i>Sidewalks are unassuming fields</i>

01:03.033 --> 01:08.371
<i>concrete and cracks
won't cut you deals</i>

01:08.372 --> 01:13.742
<i>Won't cut you deals, won't cut you</i>

01:21.785 --> 01:27.889
<i>Lost teeth like white
jewels of some kind</i>

01:31.328 --> 01:36.733
<i>Petty theft for penny crimes</i>

01:36.734 --> 01:41.071
<i>for penny crimes, and we yell</i>

01:41.072 --> 01:45.408
<i>Ah, like a good old
fashioned nightmare</i>

01:45.409 --> 01:50.312
<i>Ahh</i>

01:50.313 --> 01:55.217
<i>ah, like a good old
fashioned nightmare</i>

01:55.218 --> 02:00.788
<i>Ahh</i>

02:08.764 --> 02:15.102
<i>life being drained
through end of lives</i>

02:18.107 --> 02:24.345
<i>Still we've got nothing but time</i>

02:27.283 --> 02:33.322
<i>The skyline looks brighter tonight</i>

02:33.323 --> 02:38.127
<i>let's go smash out every light</i>

02:38.128 --> 02:42.130

<i>In front of right, and we yell</i>

02:46.468 --> 02:51.306
<i>Ah, like a good old
fashioned nightmare</i>

02:51.307 --> 02:56.144
<i>Ahh</i>

02:56.145 --> 03:00.481
<i>ah, like a good old
fashioned nightmare</i>

03:00.482 --> 03:05.952
<i>Ahh</i>

03:07.589 --> 03:11.493
Ah! Detention. Boring.

03:11.494 --> 03:14.563
I can think of a few things
we can do to kill some time.

03:14.564 --> 03:16.232
Brad, baby, you remember

03:16.233 --> 03:17.600
this is what got us into
detention in the first place.

03:17.601 --> 03:21.470
You only got me for three
more months till graduation.

03:21.471 --> 03:24.506
And it's off to boot camp
before officer training.

03:24.507 --> 03:28.611
- I know, Bradikins, it's just...
- I'm just saying, that was the time

03:28.612 --> 03:31.312
to show your support
for our troops.

03:31.313 --> 03:33.381
You do... support...

03:33.382 --> 03:37.616
- our troops.
- I do, it's...

03:59.540 --> 04:03.645
Hi, Janet. Brad.

04:03.646 --> 04:06.512
I didn't know you'd
be in detention.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.882
Whatever.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.889
I saw you got a "D"
on the cal test.

04:14.890 --> 04:17.625
Yeah, well, Mr. Corbin is a sexist.

04:17.625 --> 04:23.430
I'm sure. Anyway, I thought,
maybe, I don't know...

04:23.431 --> 04:26.730
I could tutor you.

04:28.735 --> 04:33.804
Hey, Ed, remember how I
like to hang out with you?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.298
Oops.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.375
Hell, yeah.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.253
Shit.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.728
Hey.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.701
Yo.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.069
You got it?

06:11.070 --> 06:14.204
Doth the Ashman ever fail you?

06:14.606 --> 06:16.374
You're sure it won't
pop in a piss test?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.444
100% untraceable.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.547
Dude, if Marky MCG had
been popping these,

06:22.548 --> 06:25.950
he could've run for congress
instead of lying in front of them.

06:25.951 --> 06:29.652
Good. And you're sure
you can get more?

06:31.356 --> 06:34.692
I've got the straight hook up.

06:34.693 --> 06:37.594
Wait. What's the m for?

06:38.363 --> 06:40.130
Um...

06:42.100 --> 06:47.372
Uh, midalithamethamine.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.374
That's uh, its clinical name.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.275
Hey, I've heard of that.

06:53.378 --> 06:55.279
Smart guy.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.422
<i>I am a renegade</i>

07:05.423 --> 07:07.891
<i>don't fit in with the fold, baby?</i>

07:07.892 --> 07:10.494
<i>Doin' time on the West Side way?</i>

07:10.495 --> 07:12.694
<i>Taking it day by day</i>

07:15.399 --> 07:17.067
<i>hell, yeah</i>

07:17.068 --> 07:20.335
Uh, Edster. Did you come
to visit me in the big D?

07:22.773 --> 07:26.009
Uh, no, I got detention, too.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.011
No way. You got detention?

07:28.012 --> 07:29.746
Now when your mom accuses me
of being a bad influence,

07:29.747 --> 07:32.349
she actually has a leg to stand on.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.617
Uh, yeah.

07:33.618 --> 07:37.955
Can the Ashman interest
you in his other wears?

07:37.956 --> 07:40.791
Grade a. Called blue sky.

07:40.792 --> 07:44.760
And trust me, it will
get you soaring.

07:46.864 --> 07:48.098
Yeah.

07:48.099 --> 07:49.766
No. No go, dude.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.767
This body's a temple.

07:51.768 --> 07:54.035
There's no way I'm polluting
it with that shit.

07:54.504 --> 07:55.671
Check it.

07:55.672 --> 07:58.674
I tell you, Edster, if I
ever meet George Romero,

07:58.675 --> 08:01.978
I'm gonna seduce him and bear
him little zombie babies.

08:01.979 --> 08:04.413
But then they would probably eat
us which would be kind of sad

08:04.414 --> 08:07.383
because that means no
more living dead movies.

08:07.384 --> 08:08.951
But it would be a great metaphor

08:08.952 --> 08:10.052
for what kids end up
doing to their parents

08:10.053 --> 08:13.287
when they turn into teenagers.
Right, Ed?

08:27.436 --> 08:28.671
Mrs. Rumblethorp?

08:28.672 --> 08:29.805
Eddie.

08:29.806 --> 08:31.874
I was wondering if you decided yet

08:31.875 --> 08:34.076
about telling principal McMann.

08:34.077 --> 08:38.916
Marksamus! Mi amigo.
How doth it hang?

08:38.917 --> 08:41.985
Oh, whoa, bro, you OK?

08:41.986 --> 08:43.818
It's my hand.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.888
Some crazy bum bit me
out in the parking lot.

08:45.889 --> 08:50.626
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can just ignore this.

08:50.627 --> 08:53.195
What you did is serious.

08:53.196 --> 08:55.131
It's illegal.
Not to mention dangerous.

08:55.132 --> 08:59.035
You can't tell him because
this is my chance.

08:59.036 --> 09:00.069
It's Harvard.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.204
Well, here, let
Dr. Ash take a look.

09:02.205 --> 09:05.473
I got the cure for
what ails you. Here.

09:10.513 --> 09:11.914
Oh, whoa, dude!

09:11.915 --> 09:15.318
You got some legit
nurse visiting rights.

09:15.319 --> 09:16.619
Yo, Mrs. rumbles!

09:16.620 --> 09:19.188
Ms. Ro, I think you should
check mark man's hand.

09:19.189 --> 09:20.856
No, I told you...

09:20.857 --> 09:22.091
Marksamus.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.526
For serious, hit the nurse.

09:23.527 --> 09:26.127
For one thing, she's like 10
times hotter than rumbles.

09:32.835 --> 09:34.736
Mrs. rumbles!

09:34.737 --> 09:35.971
That dude's totally got rabies.

09:35.972 --> 09:38.039
You don't go rabid in
a couple of hours.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.675
Ok, back up, everyone.

09:40.676 --> 09:42.944
Uh, Mrs. Rumblethorp...

09:45.880 --> 09:47.882
Help her!

09:47.883 --> 09:50.552
He's strangling her!

09:50.553 --> 09:52.220
On the count of 3.

09:52.221 --> 09:53.555
He's not letting go.

09:53.556 --> 09:55.488
1, 2, 3!

10:04.399 --> 10:06.001
My uniform!

10:06.002 --> 10:07.636
Jesus Christ, she's like
bleeding to death,

10:07.637 --> 10:09.104
and you're worried
about your uniform?

10:09.105 --> 10:12.707
It's blood. Do you know how
hard blood is to get out?

10:12.708 --> 10:13.842
Guys!

10:13.843 --> 10:16.244
I think Marksamus is dead zone.

10:16.245 --> 10:18.013
Uh, I'm gonna get help.

10:18.014 --> 10:19.781
Willow, we need something
to stop the bleeding.

10:19.782 --> 10:21.748
This is dry clean only.

10:23.585 --> 10:25.485
- Hey!
- Problem solved.

10:34.595 --> 10:36.695
Uh... guys?

10:37.598 --> 10:39.732
Come here!

10:58.285 --> 11:00.287
What are they doing?

11:00.288 --> 11:02.554
What kind of rabies is this?

11:05.859 --> 11:08.193
It's not rabies.

11:10.297 --> 11:11.930
They're zombies.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.339
Holy fucklestein!

11:20.340 --> 11:22.008
Oh, my God! What are we gonna do!

11:22.009 --> 11:23.009
I say we get the hell out of here.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.110
Damn straight.

11:24.111 --> 11:25.645
I don't think that's a good idea.

11:25.646 --> 11:26.879
- What?
- No, look, look, look!

11:26.880 --> 11:29.048
The guy who bit mark must
have bit other kids.

11:29.049 --> 11:31.851
If they turn into zombies
and bite other students,

11:31.852 --> 11:33.753
you've got what you call

11:33.754 --> 11:36.155
infinitely expanding
growth potential. Huh?

11:36.156 --> 11:38.658
One zombie equals
many more zombies.

11:38.659 --> 11:40.425
Oh.

11:41.661 --> 11:43.396
So we can't go out there.

11:43.397 --> 11:44.831
We don't know how many
more could be out there.

11:44.832 --> 11:45.965
They could be everywhere.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.533
What are you saying, we
should stay here and hide?

11:50.670 --> 11:52.772
Mrs. Rumblethorp, you
shouldn't be standing.

11:52.773 --> 11:54.472
She's trying to say something.

11:56.976 --> 11:58.244
<i>Oh, hey, you really need
to stop doing that.</i>

11:58.245 --> 12:00.611
<i>It's even grossing me out.</i>

12:03.716 --> 12:05.151
- Brad, baby.
- What?

12:05.152 --> 12:06.486
Kill it.

12:06.487 --> 12:09.155
Why me? Jim, you kill it.
I'll get the next one.

12:09.156 --> 12:10.822
- You're the one joining the ROTC.
- So.

12:10.823 --> 12:13.623
So go get all hoo-rah on his ass.

12:26.738 --> 12:28.840
Sorry, but I think staying
in there is a bad idea.

12:28.841 --> 12:30.607
Agreed.

12:43.922 --> 12:47.025
<i>I hope I become a ghost</i>

12:47.026 --> 12:48.727
How long before she, you know...

12:48.728 --> 12:50.028
I don't know, but
we can't leave her.

12:50.029 --> 12:53.465
<i>I hope I become a ghost</i>

12:53.466 --> 12:56.468
<i>and make sure the
future turns out fine</i>

12:56.469 --> 12:59.871
<i>I hope I become a ghost</i>

12:59.872 --> 13:03.140
<i>and when the world
is said and done</i>

13:03.141 --> 13:06.277
<i>Signs will become so close</i>

13:06.278 --> 13:09.413
<i>and there will be
nowhere that I can't run</i>

13:09.414 --> 13:15.384
<i>Ooh</i>

13:16.086 --> 13:19.757
<i>ahh</i>

13:19.758 --> 13:21.991
<i>ohh</i>

13:28.432 --> 13:33.270
Uh, to the back, come on. Come on!

13:33.271 --> 13:36.473
<i>And watch all my
grandchildren growing old</i>

13:36.474 --> 13:39.476
<i>Some they will remember me</i>

13:39.477 --> 13:42.813
<i>and others through the
stories they've been told</i>

13:42.814 --> 13:45.850
<i>Now I don't intend to frighten you</i>

13:45.851 --> 13:48.986
<i>I just want to see if
what I think is true</i>

13:48.987 --> 13:52.022
<i>Cause then and only
then we'll know</i>

13:52.023 --> 13:55.391
<i>If it was worth it
to become a ghost</i>

13:55.392 --> 13:57.727
This is the future of
our American military?

13:57.728 --> 14:01.897
I know. Pretty soon even the
French will conquer us.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.136
Chuck? Yeah, man, hit that shit.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.587
Shit.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.893
I'll check if principal
McMann is here.

14:28.894 --> 14:31.395
Babykins, you won't let
them hurt me, will you?

14:31.396 --> 14:33.130
Janet, babe, I have years
of military experience.

14:33.131 --> 14:35.099
Alright, they won't
lay a finger on you.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.368
You have years of
military experience?

14:37.369 --> 14:41.537
Yeah. I've been paintballing
with my dad since I was 6.

14:47.911 --> 14:49.345
Principal McMann?

14:49.346 --> 14:52.046
Oh, damn it! I got nothing.

14:55.118 --> 14:56.519
Uh, I got nothing here.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.887
Yeah. Me neither.

14:57.888 --> 14:59.088
Nor I.

14:59.089 --> 15:00.590
Me, too.

15:00.591 --> 15:02.292
Maybe all these, uh, corpsicles

15:02.293 --> 15:06.194
are creating some kind of
undead zone.

15:08.998 --> 15:11.401
Hey, Lilly and Ashley
are out there.

15:11.402 --> 15:13.269
They are? Well, open the door.
Let them in.

15:13.270 --> 15:15.271
They're a little busy right now.

15:15.272 --> 15:17.105
Doing what?

15:19.175 --> 15:21.311
Eating Rick Bliscan.

15:21.312 --> 15:23.146
What are you laughing at?

15:23.147 --> 15:27.517
Uh, well, when uh, Ashley
and Lilly were alive,

15:27.518 --> 15:28.952
they were always talking about

15:28.953 --> 15:30.153
who would get a piece
of Rick's ass first.

15:30.154 --> 15:31.920
So?

15:32.221 --> 15:34.656
Lilly won.

15:36.893 --> 15:39.027
Oh, fuck.

15:39.028 --> 15:40.896
That's not funny.

15:40.897 --> 15:42.030
Well, it's a little funny.

15:42.031 --> 15:44.166
Kind of cool.

15:44.167 --> 15:47.369
No, no, no. This is not cool.

15:47.370 --> 15:49.371
I know you all are raging
freakazoids and all,

15:49.372 --> 15:52.474
but even ones as far removed
from cooldom as you

15:52.475 --> 15:53.675
should still understand

15:53.676 --> 15:56.678
how much further from
coolness this situation is.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.579
Yeah.

16:14.029 --> 16:15.464
Janet, you should
really lighten up.

16:15.465 --> 16:19.101
Lighten up? No, this is
no time to lighten up.

16:19.102 --> 16:20.602
If anything, we should
all be getting heavier.

16:20.603 --> 16:22.137
Well, maybe you should
stop upchucking

16:22.138 --> 16:23.205
after every meal then.

16:23.206 --> 16:27.275
Hey! Janet's right.
This is serious.

16:27.276 --> 16:30.544
And serious times call for...
Serious minds.

16:30.545 --> 16:33.112
Thank God we have you then.

16:35.282 --> 16:38.150
Was principal McMann in there?

16:41.122 --> 16:42.888
Partly.

16:46.727 --> 16:47.962
I don't want to die here.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.130
Ok.

16:49.131 --> 16:50.564
This zombie shit

16:50.565 --> 16:53.134
is really starting to
harsh my mellow, OK?

16:53.135 --> 16:55.069
All right, look.

16:55.070 --> 16:57.570
Come on, you too, Willow.
Get in here.

17:00.307 --> 17:01.509
All right, this school

17:01.510 --> 17:04.178
is crawling with God knows
how many zomb-heads.

17:04.179 --> 17:05.679
We need to find
somewhere to hold up.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.116
And we need to fortify.

17:09.117 --> 17:10.518
Well, yeah, but everywhere we go,

17:10.519 --> 17:11.719
there's going to be
deadheads already there.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.587
Yeah, we need somewhere
no one goes to.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.992
The library.

17:17.992 --> 17:19.925
Why would we go there?

17:20.661 --> 17:24.631
It's perfect. One major
entrance and plenty of shelves

17:24.632 --> 17:26.330
to barricade the door.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.768
Sounds easily defendable.

17:28.769 --> 17:30.103
Yeah, and it's right down the hall.

17:30.104 --> 17:32.205
Good. 'Cause all this
running and shit

17:32.206 --> 17:34.007
is tuckering the Ashman out.

17:34.008 --> 17:35.542
Yeah, I don't think
Mrs. Rumblethorpe

17:35.543 --> 17:37.742
can take much more moving around.

17:45.018 --> 17:46.386
Most important...

17:46.387 --> 17:48.021
Yeah?

17:48.022 --> 17:50.557
Not a single student in this school

17:50.558 --> 17:53.224
would be caught dead there.

17:54.027 --> 17:58.363
Don't you mean caught...
Undead there?

18:19.251 --> 18:21.386
What do we do about that, brainiac?

18:21.387 --> 18:24.556
From the little observations
that I've been able to make,

18:24.557 --> 18:28.861
- zombies seem to be uni-attentional.
- Ok. What?

18:28.862 --> 18:33.529
Zombies only pay attention to
what's right in front of them.

18:33.966 --> 18:36.735
So, so if we don't draw
their attention...

18:36.736 --> 18:40.403
We should just be able
to walk right by.

18:41.406 --> 18:43.741
You go first.

19:59.817 --> 20:02.084
Way to go, Edster!

20:08.426 --> 20:10.260
This way!

20:13.598 --> 20:15.998
Downstairs. Go! Go!

20:20.371 --> 20:23.574
Hey! Hey! Come here!

20:23.575 --> 20:27.844
Come and get me! Come and get me!

20:29.513 --> 20:31.515
Hey! Go, go, go!

20:31.516 --> 20:33.551
Come and get me!

20:33.552 --> 20:35.251
Come and get me.

20:39.357 --> 20:41.123
Come here.

20:45.529 --> 20:47.798
- In the library!
- Get the door! Get the door!

20:47.799 --> 20:50.565
Go! Go!

20:53.203 --> 20:54.204
Yeah!

20:54.205 --> 20:56.137
Aha!

20:58.475 --> 21:01.910
Yeah! Hell, yeah!

21:18.862 --> 21:20.297
Jesus, Eddie.

21:20.298 --> 21:22.364
I know, I didn't think
that would actually work.

21:50.426 --> 21:52.226
Ok, she's not looking too good.

21:53.262 --> 21:54.663
I can't believe this is happening.

21:54.664 --> 21:57.766
I am student council
vice president.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.903
Junior prom queen, and
head cheerleader,

22:00.904 --> 22:02.771
and I have a serious problem

22:02.772 --> 22:04.173
with the direction
this school is taking.

22:04.174 --> 22:05.674
Well, I'd adjust
quickly if I were you,

22:05.675 --> 22:07.476
or the next popularity
contest you'll be winning

22:07.477 --> 22:10.612
is most likely to get eaten
by the student body.

22:10.613 --> 22:13.215
Aah! Oh!

22:16.286 --> 22:17.386
Again?

22:17.387 --> 22:19.153
Damn it, Janet. Help me.

22:19.955 --> 22:21.290
What should I do?

22:21.291 --> 22:24.493
Here. Hold her neck.
Keep pressure on it.

22:24.494 --> 22:26.995
Eddie's been studying medical
school since like infancy,

22:26.996 --> 22:29.163
so maybe he knows.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.067
Ew!

22:35.603 --> 22:36.704
Hey, what is it?

22:36.705 --> 22:40.606
Oh, nothing big.
Just the end of the world.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.295
Ah! Ah!

23:30.557 --> 23:32.491
Mrs. Rumblethorp?

23:36.897 --> 23:39.131
Oh, please don't be dead.

23:40.901 --> 23:42.634
Please?

23:47.908 --> 23:50.075
Ok...

24:04.891 --> 24:09.461
Ok... Ok.

24:26.412 --> 24:28.480
Come on. Janet!

24:33.752 --> 24:37.121
Bradikins. You saved me.

24:43.095 --> 24:45.329
Guys, help me!

24:47.466 --> 24:49.234
Whoa.

24:51.137 --> 24:52.439
Aah!

24:52.440 --> 24:53.607
Did she bite you?

24:53.608 --> 24:55.175
No! I bent my finger weird.

24:55.176 --> 24:56.776
I can't hold her much longer.

24:56.777 --> 24:57.978
- Her brain. Her brain!
- What?

24:57.979 --> 24:59.980
Eddie's right, the only
way to kill a zombie

24:59.981 --> 25:01.114
is destroy its brain.

25:01.115 --> 25:05.117
That cuntress has been riding
me since I was a freshman.

25:06.653 --> 25:10.688
It's time for some payback.

25:13.792 --> 25:15.726
Bring her to me.

26:10.248 --> 26:14.784
How you like me now,
Rumbly Thumbly? Hmm?

26:24.362 --> 26:25.797
It looks like rob zombie

26:25.798 --> 26:26.831
raped the entire
cast of gossip girl

26:26.832 --> 26:28.833
and this is their angry love child.

26:28.834 --> 26:30.768
And who knows what it's
like everywhere else.

26:30.769 --> 26:34.706
Tried the land lines. Nothing.

26:34.707 --> 26:38.176
So we're completely cutoff
from the rest of the world?

26:38.177 --> 26:39.177
What about the Internet?

26:39.178 --> 26:42.145
None of our phones
can get a signal.

26:43.381 --> 26:45.648
School computer?

26:46.551 --> 26:47.585
Really?

26:47.586 --> 26:49.120
That thing's so ancient

26:49.121 --> 26:50.655
it makes old tron
look cutting edge.

26:50.656 --> 26:52.756
It's worth a try, ok?

26:52.757 --> 26:54.625
You know, maybe we
can email for help.

26:54.626 --> 26:58.195
Or tweet. OMG, zombies
attacking the school.

26:58.196 --> 27:00.362
Send help pronto.

27:14.845 --> 27:16.645
Here goes nothing.

27:32.596 --> 27:34.031
This might take awhile.

27:34.032 --> 27:35.298
Well, if this isn't a commentary

27:35.299 --> 27:36.967
on the current state
of public education,

27:36.968 --> 27:39.201
I don't know what is.

27:49.311 --> 27:51.612
Yeah, that helps.

28:03.993 --> 28:07.528
<i>Feet in the air and
head on the ground</i>

28:10.366 --> 28:14.902
<i>You try this trick and spin it</i>

28:16.872 --> 28:20.910
<i>Your head will collapse
but there's nothing in it</i>

28:20.911 --> 28:23.746
<i>So you ask yourself</i>

28:23.747 --> 28:25.813
everything will be OK.

28:27.316 --> 28:29.652
Look at you.
You are way too hot to die.

28:29.653 --> 28:32.987
<i>Where is my mind</i>

28:40.662 --> 28:49.369
<i>way out in the water,
see it swimming</i>

28:53.975 --> 28:57.011
<i>I was swimming...</i>

28:57.012 --> 28:59.314
Like the werewolves
are to vampires,

28:59.315 --> 29:01.716
or are you team Switzerland?

29:02.318 --> 29:04.684
Oh, yeah, me too, yeah.

29:07.689 --> 29:09.090
<i>Except the little fish</i>

29:09.091 --> 29:13.027
<i>but they told me, he
swears tryin' to talk to me</i>

29:13.028 --> 29:18.800
<i>Where is my mind, where is my mind</i>

29:18.801 --> 29:23.470
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

29:31.044 --> 29:39.418
<i>Way out in the water,
see it swimming</i>

29:44.725 --> 29:46.493
Um, hey, guys, I think
we have a problem

29:46.494 --> 29:48.262
of incalculable proportion.

29:48.263 --> 29:49.329
Huh?

29:49.330 --> 29:51.131
Big problem.

29:51.132 --> 29:52.733
<i>Oh.</i>

29:52.734 --> 29:54.001
Are they getting in?

29:54.002 --> 29:56.236
No, no, not yet, Janet.
But they will.

29:56.237 --> 29:57.971
There's no way they're gonna
make it through the barricade.

29:57.972 --> 30:02.409
Their numbers are growing,
Jimmy. They're gonna get in.

30:02.410 --> 30:03.477
Well, then I say we run for it.

30:03.478 --> 30:04.745
No, no, that's...

30:04.746 --> 30:05.779
yeah, he's right.

30:05.780 --> 30:06.980
All right, we make a run.

30:06.981 --> 30:08.882
Maybe someone out there
has a cure or something.

30:08.883 --> 30:10.150
Yeah, and go back out there?

30:10.151 --> 30:12.753
- Yeah.
- With them?

30:12.754 --> 30:13.855
Bradikins, baby,

30:13.856 --> 30:15.423
I can't do it. I can't.

30:15.424 --> 30:16.791
Ok, look.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.493
I've seen about every
zombie movie there is,

30:18.494 --> 30:19.960
and one internal
truth in all of them

30:19.961 --> 30:21.461
is that going outside equals bad.

30:21.462 --> 30:23.030
- Exactly.
- I say we run for it.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.833
And outrun the high
school of the damned.

30:25.834 --> 30:26.967
Look, from what I've seen,

30:26.968 --> 30:28.268
I don't need to outrun one of them.

30:28.269 --> 30:29.770
I need to outrun one of you.

30:29.771 --> 30:31.939
And I'm pretty damned sure
I can beat asthma boy here.

30:31.940 --> 30:35.142
I don't have asthma.
Not all dorky kids have asthma.

30:35.143 --> 30:39.112
Yeah, look, we make a run.
Right, some of us will make it.

30:39.113 --> 30:40.280
Look at her.

30:40.281 --> 30:42.382
She's got big-ass boots on.
She can't run.

30:42.383 --> 30:45.385
- Survival of the fittest.
- Hoo-rah.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.454
I breathe just fine. Thank you.

30:47.455 --> 30:50.157
Oh, Bradikins, I can't go
out there and compete.

30:50.158 --> 30:51.458
I play sports.

30:51.459 --> 30:53.460
I'm totally OK with the
current living situation.

30:53.461 --> 30:54.795
I'm just saying.

30:54.796 --> 30:56.563
I bowl. I'm a bowler.
I'm an excellent bowler.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.132
Eddie, focus, come on.
Focus, please.

30:59.133 --> 31:01.802
Sorry. Right, sorry. Jimmy.

31:01.803 --> 31:04.872
Jimmy, your plan only works if
we all agree to go out there,

31:04.873 --> 31:07.274
and clearly there is a
large dissenting opinion

31:07.275 --> 31:08.809
that plans just stay put.

31:08.810 --> 31:09.943
Like me.

31:09.944 --> 31:11.811
And me. Brad, babe...

31:11.812 --> 31:14.345
You won't leave me here, will you?

31:16.983 --> 31:18.451
We stay.

31:18.452 --> 31:20.219
Come on!

31:22.521 --> 31:24.957
Oh, you guys seriously
need to chillax.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.926
Chillax?

31:26.927 --> 31:29.061
Yeah. Look on the bright side.

31:29.062 --> 31:32.531
Bright side? The school
is overrun with zombies.

31:32.532 --> 31:33.833
What's the bright side?

31:33.834 --> 31:37.403
When else do you get to
decapitate your English teacher

31:37.404 --> 31:40.473
and then continue to
torment her undead head?

31:40.474 --> 31:43.109
Right, Mrs. Rummy Thumber?

31:43.110 --> 31:49.382
Oh! No biting! That's a bad
Mrs. Rumbly Thumbly. Huh?

31:49.383 --> 31:51.083
Detention for you!

31:51.084 --> 31:54.485
Ash! Stop taunting the undead.

31:55.021 --> 31:56.222
All right.

31:56.223 --> 31:58.991
All right, look. I got it.

31:58.992 --> 32:01.027
If we're going to stay,

32:01.028 --> 32:03.261
we need to treat this
like a siege situation.

32:03.262 --> 32:04.930
Our greatest danger is lying

32:04.931 --> 32:06.531
either a frontal breach
of our defenses,

32:06.532 --> 32:08.466
or a small scale incursion

32:08.467 --> 32:11.668
via an as yet
unrecognized weak point.

32:14.539 --> 32:16.506
We do some recon.

32:33.191 --> 32:34.891
Eddie, you're a book geek, right?

32:36.161 --> 32:37.395
You know how to look
stuff up and shit?

32:37.396 --> 32:39.130
Sure.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.232
Maybe there's something
in here that can help.

32:41.233 --> 32:45.537
Zombie stuff, like a how-to
survive a zombie attack.

32:45.538 --> 32:47.238
Or what to do if bitten.

32:47.239 --> 32:49.641
This is a high school library,

32:49.642 --> 32:51.242
so I'm not sure there's a
lot of reference material

32:51.243 --> 32:52.377
on zombies.

32:52.378 --> 32:54.346
Yeah, too bad this
isn't the library

32:54.347 --> 32:55.646
from Buffy the vampire slayer

32:55.647 --> 32:57.814
cause they had a wicked
dark art selection.

32:59.684 --> 33:02.419
What?

33:02.420 --> 33:04.588
I liked the two gay witches.

33:04.589 --> 33:06.722
Wicked chicks are hot.

33:10.194 --> 33:11.860
Ow.

33:32.182 --> 33:36.220
Damn it! There's gotta
be something, right?

33:36.221 --> 33:38.355
Sorry, but when it
comes to living dead,

33:38.356 --> 33:40.457
your best source of info
is right in front of you.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.394
Between Eddie and I, we've
seen about every movie,

33:43.395 --> 33:45.329
read every comic book and
played every video game

33:45.330 --> 33:46.963
that has anything
to do with zombies.

33:46.964 --> 33:48.331
Yeah, that's right.

33:48.332 --> 33:51.467
When it comes to zombie
survival, we're the bad asses.

33:51.468 --> 33:55.838
Fine. Eddie, Willow, you'll
act as our intelligence...

34:06.315 --> 34:09.518
Well, that's in no way
ominous or foreboding.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.652
Baby?

34:10.654 --> 34:12.522
Janet, babe, don't worry, OK?

34:12.523 --> 34:15.590
I'll kill anything that
comes through the door.

34:19.496 --> 34:21.596
Jimmy!

34:23.331 --> 34:25.099
Jimmy!

34:29.405 --> 34:31.606
Oh, man, no!

34:34.277 --> 34:39.014
Jimmy... Hey. Hang in there.

34:39.014 --> 34:40.248
I don't feel so good.

34:40.248 --> 34:42.181
All right. I'll give you some air.

34:49.190 --> 34:51.024
Hang in there.

34:53.661 --> 34:56.096
This is not getting us anywhere.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.408
Stay there!

35:20.055 --> 35:21.822
Ugh.

35:30.398 --> 35:32.131
Whoa.

35:39.407 --> 35:40.742
I mean we can't just
leave him there.

35:40.743 --> 35:42.909
He's gonna turn.

35:43.778 --> 35:47.082
Hey, we all saw what happened
to Mrs. Rumblethorp.

35:47.083 --> 35:50.318
So, what? You want to
throw him out the window?

35:50.319 --> 35:51.753
It's Jimmy for Christ sakes.

35:51.754 --> 35:54.289
Not for long, bro.

35:54.290 --> 36:01.027
Brad, baby, they're right.
You know they're right.

36:03.098 --> 36:04.266
Ah, fuck.

36:04.267 --> 36:06.032
Brad.

36:09.371 --> 36:11.204
Jimmy.

36:15.110 --> 36:16.877
Hoo-rah.

36:28.455 --> 36:31.257
No!

36:34.128 --> 36:37.129
Hoo-rah...

37:01.155 --> 37:03.255
We're all gonna die.

37:05.159 --> 37:08.362
We're all gonna die!

37:08.363 --> 37:10.796
We're all gonna die.

37:13.834 --> 37:17.537
Janet, it's gonna be OK.
We're gonna be OK.

37:17.538 --> 37:21.507
We're gonna be OK.

37:21.508 --> 37:25.410
Uh, um, group hug.

37:33.186 --> 37:34.986
Thanks, guys.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.356
I'm OK now.

38:00.213 --> 38:02.146
Wonder what caused all this.

38:03.216 --> 38:04.983
Nuclear fallout?

38:07.653 --> 38:09.988
Military super soldier experiments.

38:09.989 --> 38:11.423
Meteors.

38:11.424 --> 38:14.825
Biological weapons.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.328
Aliens.

38:16.329 --> 38:18.328
Diseased monkeys.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.568
You know what I don't get?

38:23.569 --> 38:27.938
Mark. When he turned all
aberzombie and Fitch,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.409
he was still pretty fast.

38:30.410 --> 38:36.415
But Marion the zombrarian
was all slow and stumbly.

38:36.416 --> 38:37.883
Clearly each zombie retains

38:37.884 --> 38:39.418
some of their physical attributes

38:39.419 --> 38:41.318
from when they were alive.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.400
All right. Enough.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.536
Enough.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.838
We all seriously need to chillax

39:00.839 --> 39:02.540
before someone pops a blood vessel.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.942
Chillax? What the fuck is chillax?

39:04.943 --> 39:07.978
Chill. And relax.

39:07.979 --> 39:11.981
When the powers combine, chillax.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.651
Whatever.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.654
All I'm saying is I think it's time

39:16.655 --> 39:18.587
to intro a little...

39:18.889 --> 39:20.958
Mellow.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.794
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

39:23.795 --> 39:26.195
To this pity party.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.298
Sweet. Share the wealth.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.670
As the lady dark doth command.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.072
Wait, is that marijuana pot?

39:35.073 --> 39:36.707
Something like that.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.043
I don't think this is the
time to be getting high.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.311
I need something to calm my nerves.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.583
What say you, Bradtasm?

39:48.652 --> 39:51.653
Yeah, fuck it.
For medicinal purposes.

39:55.592 --> 39:56.760
Secondhand smoke?

39:56.761 --> 39:58.661
Won't the zombies get the munchies?

39:58.662 --> 40:00.330
Ed, they already have them.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.464
Fine.

40:01.465 --> 40:03.767
Smoking weed equals death.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.834
What?

40:04.835 --> 40:06.069
In the movies,

40:06.070 --> 40:09.572
smoking the weed equals death.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.508
Drinking equals death.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.443
Having sex equals death.

40:13.444 --> 40:17.981
Basically having fun in any
way will get you killed.

40:17.982 --> 40:21.885
Right. Horror movies are total

40:21.886 --> 40:24.888
moral righty conservative
propaganda bullshit.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.122
Tell me about it.

40:26.123 --> 40:28.758
I've never been so
happy to be a virgin.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.461
What?

40:31.462 --> 40:32.929
I'm waiting for the right girl.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.831
Uh, sure, if by the right girl

40:34.832 --> 40:36.766
you mean someone lame enough
to sleep with your ass.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.501
No, no. I mean...

40:47.709 --> 40:49.410
Yeah, whatever.

40:50.045 --> 40:52.146
High school sucks.

41:00.389 --> 41:02.122
Just do it.

41:06.062 --> 41:09.764
Oh...

41:17.907 --> 41:20.075
What was that? What is it?

41:37.626 --> 41:40.027
Oh...

41:41.430 --> 41:43.230
He was enjoying it, too.

41:51.773 --> 41:55.476
Ugh!

41:56.778 --> 42:00.449
Uh, me and uh, pale tits mistress

42:00.450 --> 42:02.484
of the extreme eyeliner

42:02.485 --> 42:06.453
are regulars in the good
ship detention, but um,

42:07.589 --> 42:09.456
what the hell are you
three doing here?

42:09.992 --> 42:10.993
Nothing.

42:10.994 --> 42:12.794
Oh, come on.

42:12.795 --> 42:17.132
What's an 18th level wizard
dungeons and dragons geek

42:17.133 --> 42:18.934
like you doing in detention?

42:18.935 --> 42:19.935
I'm a paladin.

42:19.936 --> 42:21.470
What?

42:21.471 --> 42:24.573
Wizards are for spazzes and losers.

42:24.574 --> 42:26.074
Right. Right.

42:30.645 --> 42:32.647
So what about you, sweet cheeks?

42:32.648 --> 42:33.981
Oh.

42:33.982 --> 42:36.584
Well, nothing. We were just
caught in the bathroom.

42:36.585 --> 42:39.552
What were you guys
doing in the bathroom?

42:41.622 --> 42:45.491
Are you... in the bathroom?
That's gross.

42:47.695 --> 42:48.763
I'm just playing.

42:48.764 --> 42:49.897
Check it, Willow-winds,

42:49.898 --> 42:53.234
uh, Slutskin McDrop-her-drawers
is embarrassed.

42:53.235 --> 42:56.003
No. We were...
We were just kissing.

42:56.004 --> 42:57.204
Oh, get off it, Janet.

42:57.205 --> 42:58.506
Everyone in this school
knows you got a mouth

42:58.507 --> 43:00.074
that could suck start a jet engine.

43:00.075 --> 43:01.175
Hey, come on.

43:01.176 --> 43:03.342
Fuck you.

43:05.179 --> 43:07.515
And fuck you, too!

43:07.516 --> 43:11.719
What, you boys get to chase
every ass in tight jeans,

43:11.720 --> 43:15.256
but I do what it takes
to satisfy my boyfriend,

43:15.257 --> 43:17.692
and I'm a slut?

43:17.693 --> 43:19.791
Pretty much.

43:28.001 --> 43:29.069
You don't get it.

43:29.070 --> 43:31.671
No one does.

43:31.672 --> 43:32.706
Get what?

43:32.707 --> 43:34.874
How hard it is to be me.

43:34.875 --> 43:36.710
Oh, please.

43:36.711 --> 43:38.912
There's so much pressure that
comes with being popular.

43:38.913 --> 43:44.551
Everything I do, everything
I wear is judged.

43:44.552 --> 43:45.785
By everyone.

43:45.786 --> 43:47.687
Oh, poor you.

43:47.688 --> 43:50.824
I always have to say
the right thing,

43:50.825 --> 43:53.825
wear the newest clothes,
date the coolest guy.

43:54.928 --> 43:57.197
And in the end,
you all still hate me.

43:57.198 --> 43:58.565
We don't hate you.

43:58.566 --> 44:01.801
Yes, you do.

44:01.802 --> 44:03.670
You social rejects hate
me because I'm popular.

44:03.671 --> 44:06.806
And the popular kids
hate me because...

44:06.807 --> 44:08.008
I'm more popular than them.

44:08.009 --> 44:10.943
Well, if being popular is so rough,

44:10.944 --> 44:13.145
then why don't you,

44:13.146 --> 44:16.348
I don't know, stop trying
to be the queen bee.

44:16.349 --> 44:21.852
That's easy for you to say.
You've never been popular.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.234
You're not the only one

44:35.235 --> 44:39.737
whose felt uh, so trapped
by who they are.

44:40.606 --> 44:42.941
That they did something stupid.

44:42.942 --> 44:45.409
Really, really stupid.

44:48.947 --> 44:50.049
Holy shit.

44:50.050 --> 44:51.250
Where'd you get a gun?

44:51.251 --> 44:53.951
You were gonna columbine us?

44:55.220 --> 44:57.655
I wasn't gonna columbine you.

44:58.624 --> 44:59.792
The gun is for me.

44:59.793 --> 45:01.792
You were gonna off
yourself in detention?

45:05.063 --> 45:06.998
Is this because I make fun of you?

45:06.999 --> 45:08.898
No.

45:10.234 --> 45:12.770
Is it because I didn't
go to prom with you?

45:12.771 --> 45:16.906
What? No. I didn't
even ask you to prom.

45:19.644 --> 45:21.112
It's because of her.

45:25.783 --> 45:28.853
I thought you and the rumbles

45:28.854 --> 45:30.922
were all apt pupillage and whatnot.

45:30.923 --> 45:35.425
Yeah, we were, till
she found these.

45:39.163 --> 45:40.231
Adderall?

45:40.232 --> 45:43.167
I was just using Adderall
to help me study.

45:43.168 --> 45:45.336
Mrs. Rumblethorp just caught me.

45:45.337 --> 45:48.106
And they weren't
prescribed to me. Per se.

45:48.107 --> 45:49.674
So you were riding
the Adderall train

45:49.675 --> 45:51.507
to Ivy league town.

45:52.710 --> 45:55.911
Yeah. I got into Harvard.

45:57.114 --> 46:01.918
I studied my butt off to
get out of this shit hole.

46:01.919 --> 46:05.355
To get into somewhere where
I wasn't put in a urinal

46:05.356 --> 46:07.689
for wanting to learn.

46:09.092 --> 46:10.927
That's why I'm in detention.

46:10.928 --> 46:15.265
And look, I want to live.

46:15.266 --> 46:17.000
I want to live through this.

46:17.001 --> 46:20.337
But to do that, we'd
need to work together.

46:20.338 --> 46:24.141
We'd need to put all our petty,
stupid self interests aside

46:24.142 --> 46:27.345
and work for the greater good.

46:27.346 --> 46:30.381
Well, this is high
school, so fat chance.

46:30.382 --> 46:32.950
Damn it, Ash, this isn't a joke!

46:32.951 --> 46:35.119
Two hours ago, she's
running detention

46:35.120 --> 46:37.321
and accusing you of smoking out.

46:37.322 --> 46:39.757
I fail to see the
difference, Eddie.

46:39.758 --> 46:41.425
Guys?

46:41.426 --> 46:42.460
Look, Edstser,

46:42.461 --> 46:43.961
there's one thing I know

46:43.962 --> 46:47.030
and it's when push
comes getting eaten,

46:47.031 --> 46:52.402
it's every man, cheerleader,
meathead, dork,

46:52.403 --> 46:55.505
and scary yet strangely
attractive goth chick

46:55.506 --> 46:56.873
- for themselves.
- Hey, guys...

46:56.874 --> 46:58.842
That's the attitude that's
gonna get us killed!

46:58.843 --> 47:00.911
Dude, we're all dead meat anyways.

47:00.912 --> 47:03.313
Might as well enjoy
the ride, Edster.

47:03.314 --> 47:05.046
Guys!

47:10.086 --> 47:12.754
- What?
- Listen.

47:44.353 --> 47:46.719
Hit it!

47:48.457 --> 47:51.126
Get it out of here!
Get it out of here!

47:51.127 --> 47:53.028
Get it, Eddie! Get it!

47:53.029 --> 47:55.396
Get it out of here!
Get it out of here!

48:02.004 --> 48:03.637
You saved me.

48:06.308 --> 48:08.075
Oh, my head.

48:17.152 --> 48:19.086
What?

48:38.172 --> 48:40.108
What do I do? What do I do?

48:40.109 --> 48:42.976
Pry its fingers off.

48:44.245 --> 48:46.212
Stay still!

48:47.181 --> 48:48.416
Ah, screw that!

48:48.417 --> 48:50.852
Relax. I got this.

48:50.853 --> 48:52.986
Janet, help me!

48:54.022 --> 48:55.957
Shoot it fast. Shoot it!

48:55.958 --> 48:58.492
No, no, no! Don't shoot it.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.113
Oh, my God.

49:19.114 --> 49:21.882
Oh, I got you, Ed!

49:21.883 --> 49:24.216
I got you, Ed.

49:24.885 --> 49:28.554
Ah... ah... ah...

49:43.236 --> 49:48.341
1... 2... 3...

50:07.928 --> 50:09.895
That was intense.

50:26.612 --> 50:28.779
What's the math say?

50:31.450 --> 50:33.252
That the amount of
zombies out there,

50:33.253 --> 50:35.388
should they make a
concerted effort...

50:35.389 --> 50:36.622
Yeah?

50:36.623 --> 50:38.691
They'd break through
in about 35 seconds.

50:38.692 --> 50:41.994
So we're basically screwed.

50:41.995 --> 50:43.728
Yeah.

50:55.142 --> 50:59.610
Is that what you really want?

51:00.112 --> 51:01.712
Yeah.

51:04.316 --> 51:06.082
What?

51:08.253 --> 51:10.153
She's beautiful.

51:10.989 --> 51:15.959
Sexy. Super popular.

51:18.163 --> 51:22.332
Perky. Not to mention perky.
I'm a big fan of perky.

51:26.071 --> 51:28.772
You're just like the
rest of these idiots.

51:30.341 --> 51:31.743
You were a bunch of mindless

51:31.744 --> 51:34.210
zombies before any
of this happened.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.683
Trying so hard to fit
into their little clique.

51:38.684 --> 51:43.354
Trying so hard to hide anything
that might make them stand out.

51:43.355 --> 51:44.556
I mean, God forbid

51:44.557 --> 51:46.357
we don't all fit into
this cookie cutter mold

51:46.358 --> 51:48.792
that everyone puts us in.

51:51.030 --> 51:52.863
Popular girl.

51:53.499 --> 51:55.332
Bully.

51:56.435 --> 51:58.268
Stoner idiot.

51:59.537 --> 52:01.706
Dorky loser.

52:01.707 --> 52:03.608
I'm not like them.

52:03.609 --> 52:05.143
Sure you are.

52:05.144 --> 52:09.380
You'd die for one night with Janet.

52:09.381 --> 52:12.584
Not because you love her
or that you care for her.

52:12.585 --> 52:16.387
Just because she's what
everybody tells you

52:16.388 --> 52:18.188
you should strive for.

52:19.224 --> 52:23.059
And you were going to
kill yourself last night.

52:23.728 --> 52:25.730
Why?

52:25.731 --> 52:27.897
Because you weren't going
to get into Harvard?

52:30.235 --> 52:32.335
So what, Eddie.

52:33.071 --> 52:35.972
Does that mean your life
isn't worth living?

52:39.744 --> 52:41.678
You're right.

52:43.414 --> 52:45.982
Maybe I need to...

52:48.086 --> 52:50.220
I don't know, grow up a bit.

52:50.221 --> 52:52.888
Maybe we all do.

52:58.228 --> 53:02.231
Hey, if we live through this, um...

53:03.100 --> 53:04.268
Yeah?

53:04.269 --> 53:07.936
Would you want to, you know...

53:12.843 --> 53:16.180
I mean, if you don't,
that's cool, I mean...

53:16.181 --> 53:20.117
Oh, no. I want, I, I uh...

53:20.118 --> 53:21.850
I definitely want to.

53:26.890 --> 53:28.791
Oh. Cool.

53:29.459 --> 53:31.226
Cool.

54:02.325 --> 54:03.593
Edster!

54:03.594 --> 54:04.727
Uh...

54:04.728 --> 54:08.164
How long until the
zombie horde gets bored

54:08.165 --> 54:10.331
and scampers into
the next taco bell?

54:11.200 --> 54:13.836
I don't know. In the movies,
the horde never goes away.

54:13.837 --> 54:15.171
It keeps getting bigger.

54:15.172 --> 54:17.873
And that's what makes it a horde.

54:17.874 --> 54:21.477
Well, we have a problem then.

54:21.478 --> 54:22.612
What?

54:22.613 --> 54:23.879
Le toilet.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.881
Come on, man.
Find a corner or something.

54:25.882 --> 54:28.417
Oh, gross!

54:28.418 --> 54:29.552
Oh, no go, man.

54:29.553 --> 54:31.587
I gotta take a deuce
from the caboose.

54:31.588 --> 54:33.388
I say we blow this popsicle stand

54:33.389 --> 54:35.223
and make a pit stop along the way.

54:35.224 --> 54:36.858
Just hang your ass out the window.

54:36.859 --> 54:40.362
Oh, no, so some zomb-head
can take a bite out of my ass?

54:40.363 --> 54:41.429
We're on the second floor.

54:41.430 --> 54:42.597
Zombies don't jump, idiot.

54:42.598 --> 54:45.567
Oh, screw that.
I watched shark week on TLC.

54:45.568 --> 54:49.704
And if some great white can
jump 20 feet out of the air

54:49.705 --> 54:52.407
to grab a tasty seagull snackpack,

54:52.408 --> 54:53.775
who's to say a zombie can't?

54:53.776 --> 54:56.344
Well, there are major logic flaws...

54:56.345 --> 54:57.479
no. Ash is right.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.681
- He is?
- I am?

54:59.682 --> 55:03.618
Yeah. No, not about
zombies jumping. That's stupid.

55:03.619 --> 55:05.353
But we need to get the
hell out of here.

55:05.354 --> 55:06.421
We can't leave.

55:06.422 --> 55:08.957
The barricade's our
only protection.

55:08.958 --> 55:10.225
I gotta go, man.

55:10.226 --> 55:13.528
That means a trip to
the little boy's room.

55:13.529 --> 55:14.696
Ed, you know, maybe they're right.

55:14.697 --> 55:17.465
You said yourself the
barricade won't hold.

55:17.466 --> 55:18.933
Maybe we should make a run for it.

55:18.934 --> 55:21.569
I'm not going out there.

55:21.570 --> 55:26.171
Brad, baby, you wouldn't
leave me, would you?

55:27.574 --> 55:30.010
I'm sorry, babe.

55:30.011 --> 55:31.679
Come on, let's go.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.846
No, you can't. You can't go.

55:32.847 --> 55:33.981
If you start moving things around,

55:33.982 --> 55:35.582
you're gonna draw them
closer to the door.

55:35.583 --> 55:36.784
Hey, wait.

55:36.785 --> 55:38.018
What?

55:38.019 --> 55:40.185
What if there's another way?

55:42.923 --> 55:44.658
What, are you gonna escape
through the vent shaft?

55:44.659 --> 55:47.328
No. I'm gonna send my little
sidekick ferret to go get help.

55:47.329 --> 55:48.996
It'd be so cool if that were true.

55:48.997 --> 55:51.465
Look at it this way, this
might be our only chance,

55:51.466 --> 55:53.867
and I for one would like
to live past this day.

55:53.868 --> 55:57.604
Especially now that I have
something to look forward to.

55:57.605 --> 56:00.040
What if there's a
zombie in the shaft?

56:00.041 --> 56:02.576
How's a zombie gonna get
in the shaft, Eddie?

56:02.577 --> 56:04.044
I don't know. Zombie rats?

56:04.045 --> 56:05.679
<i>Like in house of the damned?</i>

56:05.680 --> 56:08.282
Those fuckers will
eat your shit up.

56:08.283 --> 56:10.217
There's no fucking zombies
in the shaft, you guys.

56:10.218 --> 56:11.418
I'm going.

56:11.419 --> 56:15.454
Me, too. Ashbury needs
his porcelain throne.

56:16.456 --> 56:19.557
Ed, look, this might be
your only chance, OK?

56:20.026 --> 56:21.993
Well, I'm not going.

56:24.664 --> 56:27.498
Isn't someone gonna
stay here with me?

56:29.302 --> 56:31.069
Ed?

56:38.644 --> 56:40.979
I'm sorry, Willow.

56:43.983 --> 56:45.918
Come on. Let's get out of here.

56:45.919 --> 56:50.054
Let's go.

57:29.362 --> 57:32.031
Um, do either of you have any idea

57:32.032 --> 57:34.132
which direction we should be going?

57:36.702 --> 57:38.469
Of course not.

58:22.747 --> 58:24.983
You're a really great
guy, you know that?

58:30.422 --> 58:32.757
Can I ask you something?

58:32.758 --> 58:34.524
Sure.

58:35.627 --> 58:37.661
Would you ever...

58:45.003 --> 58:47.604
Go out with a guy like me?

58:48.440 --> 58:50.474
I don't think so.

59:05.456 --> 59:06.657
Uh-oh.

59:06.658 --> 59:08.724
What? What is it?

59:12.130 --> 59:14.899
Oh! Fuck, dude! Confined spaces.

59:14.900 --> 59:18.502
Oh, God, Ash. Not cool. Not cool.

59:18.503 --> 59:20.137
I told you I had to go.

59:20.138 --> 59:22.404
Why?

59:23.073 --> 59:25.142
That's just the way it is.

59:25.143 --> 59:26.176
That's the way it is?

59:26.177 --> 59:28.479
You're a geek, right?

59:28.480 --> 59:31.015
Um, yeah. I guess.

59:31.016 --> 59:33.217
Well, I'm a hot cheerleader, right?

59:33.218 --> 59:34.652
Yeah.

59:34.653 --> 59:37.221
Geeks and cheerleaders don't date.

59:37.222 --> 59:39.557
We're just different.

59:39.558 --> 59:43.826
Well, why?
You just said I was a good guy.

59:43.827 --> 59:46.095
It's just not that simple.

59:46.096 --> 59:47.664
Am I not good looking enough?

59:47.665 --> 59:49.430
Yeah.

59:56.206 --> 59:58.206
Shit.

01:00:09.852 --> 01:00:11.886
Holy Moses Malone.

01:00:12.722 --> 01:00:14.290
House of the damned!
House of the damned!

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:16.459
Get back, you guys!

01:00:22.298 --> 01:00:25.201
You're just so stuck up.

01:00:25.202 --> 01:00:26.769
Fuck you, Eddie.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:29.205
No, fuck you, Janet.

01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:38.580
What was that?

01:00:38.581 --> 01:00:40.347
Uh-oh.

01:00:40.882 --> 01:00:43.284
Mother puss bucket.

01:00:47.956 --> 01:00:50.826
Do you like being made fun of?

01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:51.927
Or beat up?

01:00:51.928 --> 01:00:53.128
Of course not.

01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:55.362
Neither do I.

01:00:56.064 --> 01:00:59.101
That's exactly what would
happen if we dated.

01:00:59.102 --> 01:01:01.637
My friends would eat me alive.

01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:07.474
Did you ever think that maybe
they're not your friends?

01:01:20.922 --> 01:01:23.291
Ash... Ash...

01:01:23.292 --> 01:01:25.192
Yeah?

01:01:40.307 --> 01:01:41.609
Oh, no.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.610
What?

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.345
My stash.

01:01:44.346 --> 01:01:45.346
What?

01:01:45.347 --> 01:01:47.213
My stash!

01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:50.618
I can't find my stash.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.319
Dude, give me a boost.
Come on, man.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.387
Give me a boost.

01:01:53.388 --> 01:01:54.722
What the hell, are you guys crazy?

01:01:54.723 --> 01:01:56.857
Dude, I'm not leaving
my weed behind.

01:01:56.858 --> 01:01:58.959
All right, come on.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.826
1, 2, 3...

01:02:03.364 --> 01:02:04.632
Morons.

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.465
Push me.

01:02:12.074 --> 01:02:13.774
Dude, hurry up.

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:15.876
Chillax.

01:02:15.877 --> 01:02:18.579
Dude, it's all good.

01:02:36.162 --> 01:02:38.129
Ash?

01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:55.349
Has anyone ever told you you
have really pretty eyes?

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.352
My mom.

01:02:58.353 --> 01:03:00.653
She says they're my best feature.

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.557
You're really beautiful.

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.263
Has anyone ever told you that?

01:03:09.264 --> 01:03:11.764
Sure. All the time.

01:03:15.034 --> 01:03:16.801
Oh.

01:03:18.037 --> 01:03:19.139
Well, they're right.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.707
I know.

01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:23.641
Oh, my God.

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:45.497
Uh...

01:03:46.733 --> 01:03:48.666
You got any ideas?

01:03:50.904 --> 01:03:52.906
Sorry, Ash.

01:03:52.907 --> 01:03:54.672
Take it.

01:04:16.762 --> 01:04:17.796
Eddie?

01:04:17.797 --> 01:04:20.731
Yeah?

01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:43.787
I don't want to die a virgin.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:46.557
What?

01:04:52.064 --> 01:04:56.432
I mean, I've done
stuff, but never...

01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:02.907
Uh, but... All right, well...

01:05:02.908 --> 01:05:04.841
Willow...

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:36.307
Eddie!

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:37.508
Janet, open the door!

01:05:37.509 --> 01:05:38.576
Open up!

01:05:38.577 --> 01:05:39.911
Open the door.

01:05:39.912 --> 01:05:42.179
Open the door!

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.849
- Eddie!
- Janet!

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:45.883
But the zombies.

01:05:45.884 --> 01:05:47.616
Hurry!

01:05:51.888 --> 01:05:53.023
Eddie!

01:05:53.024 --> 01:05:54.524
- Open the door!
- Open up!

01:05:54.525 --> 01:05:56.458
Open the door!

01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:06.069
Where's Ash?

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.270
Right here.

01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:09.004
At least what's left of him.

01:06:17.414 --> 01:06:18.548
We need more stuff.

01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:20.984
Go! Go! We'll take it!

01:06:20.985 --> 01:06:23.552
Brad! Brad!

01:06:24.554 --> 01:06:26.555
Help us!

01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:34.162
Watch out!

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.608
This isn't gonna hold for long.

01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:48.344
We need to figure a
way out of here.

01:06:48.345 --> 01:06:49.912
Agreed.

01:06:49.913 --> 01:06:52.179
Eddie, I gotta talk to you.

01:06:52.581 --> 01:06:53.916
What?

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:55.017
Eddie!

01:06:55.018 --> 01:06:57.186
It'll just take a second.

01:06:57.187 --> 01:06:58.387
I have to tell you something.

01:06:58.388 --> 01:07:00.588
Hold the fort down.
I'll be right back.

01:07:02.925 --> 01:07:04.858
What is it?

01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:08.096
We didn't finish.

01:07:31.285 --> 01:07:33.588
OK, no, I mean...

01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:35.223
We might be dead soon.

01:07:35.224 --> 01:07:37.156
Carpe diemonous.

01:07:51.072 --> 01:07:52.573
Brad! What are you doing?

01:07:52.574 --> 01:07:55.309
Wake up! Brad!

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:57.010
Stop!

01:08:04.053 --> 01:08:05.953
Guys!

01:08:08.023 --> 01:08:09.923
It's not what...

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:12.860
Well, actually it's exactly
what you may think.

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:18.032
It's Brad. He must've
been bit. He's turning.

01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:28.376
Brad! Brad! Stop!

01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:30.943
Bradikins.

01:08:36.017 --> 01:08:38.649
The door.

01:08:40.188 --> 01:08:43.057
Eddie, help me!

01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:45.393
Brad, baby, I'm sorry.
I know I cheated.

01:08:45.394 --> 01:08:47.194
Damn it, Janet! Fight him!

01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:49.697
No. I deserve it. I betrayed him.

01:08:49.698 --> 01:08:51.799
No, no, Janet.
Actually he betrayed you.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.501
What?

01:08:53.502 --> 01:08:54.702
Yeah. He's been telling
the whole school

01:08:54.703 --> 01:08:56.104
that he's been screwing
you for months.

01:08:56.104 --> 01:08:57.805
No, we were waiting for prom.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:08:59.240
That's not what he told me.

01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:02.143
Yeah, I don't even think
you'd make it to prom.

01:09:02.144 --> 01:09:04.078
Because he's got like
6 girls on the side.

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:05.179
What?

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.349
Yeah. Like Lilly and
Trish, and Sarah.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.716
Whores!

01:09:09.718 --> 01:09:11.586
And you know what else,

01:09:11.587 --> 01:09:13.720
he told me you're not
a natural blonde.

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:14.720
What?

01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:16.421
Yeah!

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.792
You fucking fucker!

01:09:21.394 --> 01:09:23.161
Yeah! Fuck him up!

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:26.500
You fucking fucker!

01:09:26.501 --> 01:09:29.169
Maybe if you reciprocated
once in awhile

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:30.303
you'd know,

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:33.340
the carpet does match the blinds!

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:34.374
Match the blinds?

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:36.841
Just go with it. She's on a roll.

01:09:45.385 --> 01:09:46.586
Get out! Get out!

01:09:46.587 --> 01:09:48.252
Let's go!

01:09:50.724 --> 01:09:52.357
Yeah!

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.607
It's not gonna hold.

01:10:08.608 --> 01:10:09.775
We need to get out of here.

01:10:09.776 --> 01:10:11.243
Well, maybe we should
spend more time

01:10:11.244 --> 01:10:13.746
building up the barricade and
less time making out in the back.

01:10:13.747 --> 01:10:15.714
Well, maybe if people knocked
instead of just barging in.

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:17.149
What does that have to
do with anything, Janet?

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:19.118
Oh, my God! Stop it both of you!

01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:21.654
Now we're getting
out of here alive,

01:10:21.655 --> 01:10:23.489
and to do that we need
to work together.

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:25.222
How?

01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:36.834
I have a plan.

01:11:38.963 --> 01:11:40.398
We reached the stairs.

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:43.099
Oh, God, we reached the stairs!

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:51.540
Eddie! Eddie! Help! Eddie!

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.212
Eddie, help!

01:11:55.213 --> 01:11:57.547
Jesus Christ, we get it already.
You need help!

01:11:57.548 --> 01:11:58.782
Take a number, get in line.

01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:02.918
And shut the fuck up,
would you, please!

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.920
Eddie!

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.758
Eddie, help!

01:12:07.759 --> 01:12:09.424
Eddie!

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.477
Goth chicks kick ass.

01:12:27.478 --> 01:12:30.078
Eddie, help!

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.541
- The gun.
- Isn't that...

01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:01.175
Mr. Yeardley the
guidance counselor?

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:12.788
It's almost empty.

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:14.290
Not good.

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.791
Definitely not good.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:18.292
- What now?
- We run!

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:22.698
Run away!

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.680
Which way!

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:40.348
The gym. We can get to
the roof from there.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.926
It's locked!

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.760
I got this.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.472
I got it!

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.607
Eddie, come on!

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:13.948
Go. Go, get to the roof.
I'm gonna hold them.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.953
And Willow, about
before with Janet...

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:21.989
You're right.

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.358
I'm an idiot.

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:30.530
I know what I want now.

01:14:34.702 --> 01:14:37.604
Good. Because you
still owe me a date.

01:14:44.145 --> 01:14:46.981
It's time for this paladin
to cast a 21st level spell

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.416
of zombie whoop-ass.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:56.057
<i>I am a man, I am a man,
I am a man, I am a man</i>

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:59.192
<i>'Cause you said I am</i>

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.136
<i>cut me out of the family photo</i>

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:18.744
<i>Who would have thought
of sinking so low?</i>

01:15:21.415 --> 01:15:23.182
Where's Eddie?

01:15:24.418 --> 01:15:26.385
Holding off the horde.

01:15:27.421 --> 01:15:29.321
OK.

01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:33.225
But he missed a few.

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:53.745
<i>Cut me out of the family photo</i>

01:15:56.783 --> 01:16:02.421
<i>Who would have thought
of sinking so low?</i>

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:08.060
<i>It's impossible</i>

01:16:12.398 --> 01:16:16.802
<i>but maybe it's possible
to be impossible</i>

01:16:16.803 --> 01:16:22.909
<i>I am a man, I am a man, I am a man</i>

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:27.778
<i>I am a man 'cause you said I am</i>

01:16:33.486 --> 01:16:39.125
<i>I am a man, I am a man, I am a man</i>

01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:44.362
<i>I am a man 'cause you said I am</i>

01:16:45.831 --> 01:16:47.665
<i>Yeah</i>

01:17:09.287 --> 01:17:11.188
No.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:21.331
Janet, hold still.

01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:31.174
Come on!

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:49.659
Willow! Janet!

01:18:00.237 --> 01:18:02.471
Suck a duck.

01:18:18.255 --> 01:18:19.922
This sucks.

01:18:20.591 --> 01:18:22.259
Yeah.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.360
I'm gonna die.

01:18:27.598 --> 01:18:31.333
I don't wanna be a zombie.
This so sucks.

01:18:37.241 --> 01:18:38.941
Don't leave.

01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:56.558
One bullet left.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.235
I don't want to die like this.

01:19:48.811 --> 01:19:54.649
<i>Morning has broken</i>

01:19:55.685 --> 01:20:00.988
<i>like the first morning</i>

01:20:06.963 --> 01:20:08.796
Eddie!

01:20:12.034 --> 01:20:13.836
- OK, we have a problem.
- What?

01:20:13.837 --> 01:20:16.437
Zombies don't jump. They climb.

01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:49.703
Brad!

01:20:52.174 --> 01:20:54.808
Brad!

01:21:20.769 --> 01:21:23.736
So I guess we'll
never get that date.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.108
No. It sucks.

01:21:30.444 --> 01:21:32.745
I was totally gonna
take you to applebees.

01:21:43.457 --> 01:21:51.131
<i>I was thinking about you,
I can't live without you</i>

01:21:51.132 --> 01:21:55.369
<i>The sweet look in your
eyes that goes to...</i>

01:21:56.137 --> 01:21:57.838
Attention, attention.

01:21:57.839 --> 01:21:59.907
The zombie threat
has been contained.

01:21:59.908 --> 01:22:03.442
All survivors make your
way to the front lawn.

01:22:05.279 --> 01:22:07.014
Go! Go! Go!
I want to get a perimeter.

01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:08.948
Set it up. Move it,
move it, move it!

01:22:10.351 --> 01:22:12.286
The zombie threat
has been contained.

01:22:12.287 --> 01:22:15.121
The zombie threat has
been eliminated.

01:22:15.122 --> 01:22:19.090
All survivors make your
way to the front lawn.

01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:30.503
So applebees, huh?

01:22:30.504 --> 01:22:33.172
Bet your ass. I got a gift card.

01:22:33.173 --> 01:22:35.208
Wow, you really know
how to spoil a girl.

01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:38.843
Yeah. But only the right girl.

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:47.186
<i>When I was pacing around</i>

01:22:47.187 --> 01:22:52.592
<i>the streets where we both drive</i>

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:58.331
<i>To forget the world
striking sparks in my heart</i>

01:22:58.332 --> 01:23:03.202
<i>when we first met</i>

01:23:03.203 --> 01:23:09.141
<i>the time has all gone by, I'm well</i>

01:23:09.142 --> 01:23:16.882
<i>I've made every second
that you pass through me</i>

01:23:16.883 --> 01:23:23.889
<i>Well, I'm finding out
these memories are so good</i>

01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:31.962
<i>And I'm waiting patiently</i>

01:23:40.907 --> 01:23:45.609
<i>Attention, all shoppers.
Attention, all shoppers.</i>

01:24:00.591 --> 01:24:03.294
<i>If it's the end of the world</i>

01:24:03.295 --> 01:24:07.064
<i>I want to live inside
a shopping mall</i>

01:24:07.065 --> 01:24:11.302
<i>I wouldn't care
about the isolation</i>

01:24:11.303 --> 01:24:15.638
<i>I'm unconcerned about
the walking dead</i>

01:24:16.274 --> 01:24:19.511
<i>If it's the end of the world</i>

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:23.281
<i>I think I'd handle
myself quite well</i>

01:24:23.282 --> 01:24:27.552
<i>I wouldn't panic
walking past the zombie</i>

01:24:27.553 --> 01:24:32.222
<i>I'd try to catch up on
some reading and movies</i>

01:24:34.226 --> 01:24:37.294
<i>I know all I need to know</i>

01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:39.965
<i>I know all I need to do</i>

01:24:39.966 --> 01:24:43.301
<i>I learned everything
from George Romero</i>

01:24:43.302 --> 01:24:47.472
<i>Dario Argento, maybe Tom Savini</i>

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:50.141
<i>Stuart Gordon and Sam Raimi</i>

01:24:50.142 --> 01:24:52.343
<i>did they plant the idea</i>

01:24:52.344 --> 01:24:54.412
<i>or was it always in me</i>

01:24:54.413 --> 01:24:56.213
<i>do you find me creepy</i>

01:24:56.214 --> 01:24:58.748
<i>yeah, do I give you the creeps</i>

01:25:13.664 --> 01:25:16.434
<i>It's the end of the world</i>

01:25:16.435 --> 01:25:20.337
<i>we could gather
half a dozen friends</i>

01:25:20.338 --> 01:25:24.408
<i>We'd live in hiding
over JC Penney's</i>

01:25:24.409 --> 01:25:28.811
<i>Construct a wall to
keep the mutants out</i>

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.550
<i>When it's the end of the world?</i>

01:25:32.551 --> 01:25:36.520
<i>We'd land a helicopter
on the rooftop</i>

01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.590
<i>Somebody breaks in
through a boarded entrance</i>

01:25:40.591 --> 01:25:44.793
<i>maybe we can make a run for it</i>

01:25:47.363 --> 01:25:49.032
<i>I know all I need to know</i>

01:25:49.033 --> 01:25:52.635
<i>I learned everything

<i>do you find me creepy</i>

01:26:06.383 --> 01:26:09.552
<i>now it's the end of the world</i>

01:26:09.553 --> 01:26:13.389
<i>I always thought I
would've been more careful</i>

01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:17.393
<i>Didn't look to be a serious bite?</i>

01:26:17.394 --> 01:26:22.230
<i>Will you wait here till
I come back to life?</i>

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:27.504
<i>I learned everything

01:26:27.505 --> 01:26:31.074

You know what I'm thinking?

01:26:45.655 --> 01:26:47.656
Maybe we got a good
thing going here.

01:26:47.657 --> 01:26:52.150
Maybe we shouldn't be in
such a hurry to leave.
