00:11.899 --> 00:13.899
You're a traitor
to this country

00:13.900 --> 00:15.800
and a disgrace
to your office.

00:15.867 --> 00:17.600
Logan wants me dead
because

00:17.667 --> 00:19.101
he thinks I know too much.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.201
<i>Logan had more to protect,</i>
<i>and you know that.</i>

00:22.567 --> 00:23.667
Aaron?

00:23.734 --> 00:25.267
Ma'am, please stay
where you are.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.368
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:37.967 --> 00:39.167
Bierko's escaped.

00:39.234 --> 00:40.001
What?

00:40.067 --> 00:41.001
How long ago?

00:41.067 --> 00:42.934
<i>Davis, Karen Hayes here.</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:44.067
What happened?

00:44.134 --> 00:45.967
Our lead car got taken out
by an IED.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.001
I overheard Bierko
talking to his men.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.067
He said they're not finished.

00:49.134 --> 00:50.201
I'm sure he said something

00:50.267 --> 00:51.700
about a nerve gas canister.

00:51.767 --> 00:52.967
Henderson set up Bierko

00:53.034 --> 00:54.567
with the nerve gas
to begin with.

00:54.633 --> 00:55.800
Trust me.
You're wasting your time.

00:55.867 --> 00:56.834
He's not going
to help us.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.167
He will if we offer him a deal.

00:58.234 --> 01:01.401
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:01.468 --> 01:03.934
I'll disappear just like you did

01:04.001 --> 01:06.401
so they wouldn't
turn you over to the Chinese.

01:06.468 --> 01:09.067
Anything less than Bierko's head
on a plate,

01:09.134 --> 01:11.667
this deal is off.

01:11.734 --> 01:13.167
Bierko's going to release
the Sentox gas soon.

01:13.234 --> 01:14.434
We need to know where.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.001
CHLOE:
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

01:16.067 --> 01:18.533
What is the armament package
on a Russian Delta-4 class sub?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.734
Best of my knowledge, 12
Scorpion land-attack missiles.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.134
They're fast and accurate,
carry multiple warheads.

01:24.201 --> 01:25.867
One of them can take out
several city blocks.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.633
Lieutenant, we believe
the <i>Natalia</i>

01:27.700 --> 01:29.267
has been targeted
for a terrorist attack.

01:29.334 --> 01:30.500
<i>We think the terrorists</i>

01:30.567 --> 01:32.533
<i>are after your missiles</i>
<i>on the sub.</i>

01:32.600 --> 01:34.134
<i>You need to secure your vessel</i>

01:34.201 --> 01:36.034
<i>and lock down your</i>
<i>weapons system immediately.</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.533 --> 01:53.867
We have control
of the weapons system.

01:53.934 --> 01:55.967
Vertical tubes are loaded
and ready.

02:27.334 --> 02:29.500
I've flushed the Sentox.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.934
The atmospheric readings
are all normal.

02:32.001 --> 02:33.867
It's safe to breathe.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.667
The coordinates
for the targets--

02:39.734 --> 02:41.567
upload them
into the missiles.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.234
Begin the launch
countdown.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.201
Remove your masks.

02:52.267 --> 02:56.001
We are close to finishing
what we started today.

02:56.067 --> 02:59.500
I have identified
12 high-value targets:

02:59.567 --> 03:02.800
financial centers,
transportation hubs,

03:02.867 --> 03:06.134
high-population-density areas.

03:06.201 --> 03:08.434
The Americans
will wake up this morning

03:08.500 --> 03:10.767
to discover how steep a price
they've paid

03:10.834 --> 03:13.633
for their alliance with Moscow.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.867
What we're about
to accomplish today

03:16.934 --> 03:20.834
will be remembered
by our countrymen forever.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.734
( <i>typing</i> )

03:33.967 --> 03:35.800
Ms. Raines.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.567
Admiral Kirkland.

03:37.633 --> 03:39.734
I understand you're reporting
some type of emergency at

03:39.800 --> 03:40.867
the Port of Los Angeles?

03:40.934 --> 03:42.533
In anticipation
of today's treaty

03:42.600 --> 03:44.934
with the Russians,
the Russian submarine <i>Natalia</i>

03:45.001 --> 03:47.167
is docked here
for inspection by the U.S. Navy.

03:47.234 --> 03:49.934
I'm familiar with the exercise.
I authorized it myself.

03:50.001 --> 03:52.500
Terrorists have seized control
of that submarine.

03:52.567 --> 03:56.234
What? We haven't received any
distress signals from the crew.

03:56.301 --> 03:57.800
Because they're dead, sir,
all of them,

03:57.867 --> 03:59.533
including the Russian crew.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.401
We believe the terrorists
have flooded

04:01.468 --> 04:03.401
the sub's ventilation system
with Sentox nerve gas.

04:03.468 --> 04:05.334
My God.

04:05.401 --> 04:07.900
Sir, I don't mean to preempt
your protocols, but how long

04:07.967 --> 04:10.334
will it take you
to scramble a flight of F-18s?

04:10.401 --> 04:13.101
You're asking me
to sink the submarine?

04:13.167 --> 04:15.201
Sir, these terrorists
are in control of 12

04:15.267 --> 04:16.434
multiple-warhead missiles,

04:16.500 --> 04:18.567
which they will use
against civilian targets

04:18.632 --> 04:20.401
unless we stop them first.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.034
I'll need all of this confirmed.

04:23.101 --> 04:24.533
We have a team on the ground
that can confirm,

04:24.600 --> 04:26.034
but now I need
to know precisely:

04:26.101 --> 04:29.234
How long will it take for you
to scramble these fighters?

04:29.301 --> 04:30.734
I'm sending you the estimated

04:30.800 --> 04:34.134
approach vectors
and ETA for my F-18s.

04:34.201 --> 04:37.067
I can have my fighter jets there
within 22 to 25 minutes.

04:37.134 --> 04:38.900
We have a problem, sir.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.401
According to our simulation,
Bierko will have

04:40.468 --> 04:43.533
his missiles in the air
in less than 20 minutes.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.567
Scrambling the jets right now,
but it seems to me as if this is

04:46.633 --> 04:48.800
going to be up to your team
on the ground.

05:02.667 --> 05:05.001
We have visual contact
with the sub.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.767
Hatches are still closed.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.001
Ship's been locked down.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.533
Confirming one hostile topside,
standing guard.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.034
Jack, Chloe's simulation
has Bierko firing those missiles

05:14.101 --> 05:15.567
in less than 20 minutes.

05:15.633 --> 05:18.201
Sooner than that if he's already
started programming targets.

05:18.267 --> 05:20.401
The Navy won't be able
to intercept in time.

05:20.468 --> 05:21.900
Jack, it's Audrey.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.067
I just got off the phone
with Admiral Kirkland.

05:24.134 --> 05:26.800
He's scrambling F-18s,
but they won't be
able to get them

05:26.867 --> 05:29.800
in the air in time in order
to destroy the sub.
How far out are reinforcements?

05:29.867 --> 05:31.001
Too far.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.368
Additional tac teams
won't arrive until

05:32.434 --> 05:33.734
after the missiles
have launched.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.001
That means we have
to take Bierko down ourselves.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.767
That's not a real option, Jack.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.034
There are only four
entry points on that submarine.

05:40.101 --> 05:41.667
We have to assume that
Bierko's locked them down

05:41.734 --> 05:43.334
and is defending them.

05:43.401 --> 05:44.567
AUDREY:
Jack, Bill's right.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.001
We don't have the manpower
or the resources

05:46.067 --> 05:47.434
to get on that sub.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.334
We might.
Somebody just launched

05:49.401 --> 05:51.934
a signal tube
off the starboard side.

05:52.001 --> 05:53.067
What's a signal tube?

05:53.134 --> 05:54.101
It's a radio beacon
crewmen can send

05:54.167 --> 05:56.934
to the surface in
case of emergencies.

05:57.001 --> 05:58.434
Chloe, if there
are friendlies inside,

05:58.500 --> 05:59.967
they can help us
board the sub.

06:00.034 --> 06:02.334
I want you to scan all
emergency frequencies.
On it.

06:02.401 --> 06:04.034
Standing by.

06:04.101 --> 06:05.368
Jack, just so
we're straight--

06:05.434 --> 06:07.700
we stop Bierko,
my wife and I disappear

06:07.767 --> 06:10.767
for good, with
your help, right?

06:10.834 --> 06:12.334
Yeah.
One other thing.

06:12.401 --> 06:14.867
If I'm going on that sub
with you, I need a firearm.

06:14.934 --> 06:17.468
I'll cover you.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.700
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.800
I don't go anywhere undefended
against hostiles.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.667
I still consider
you a hostile.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.834
Jack, I don't get a gun,
I don't go in.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.867
CHLOE:
Jack, you were right.
There's a survivor

06:27.934 --> 06:29.867
on the submarine. He's sending
out a distress signal.

06:29.934 --> 06:32.201
Can he receive
on this frequency?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.900
Yeah.
Patch him through.

06:38.867 --> 06:41.600
MAN:
I repeat. Petty Officer

06:41.667 --> 06:45.034
Tim Rooney,
on <i>Natalia</i> K524.

06:45.101 --> 06:48.500
Code seven. SOS.
We are under attack.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.500
Petty Officer Rooney,
my name is Jack Bauer.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.967
I'm with the Counterterrorist
Unit, Los Angeles.

06:53.034 --> 06:54.834
What the hell is going on, sir?

06:54.900 --> 06:55.967
Everyone's dead.

06:57.468 --> 06:59.500
And there are people
in the Control Room

06:59.567 --> 07:01.067
trying to operate
the missile launch system.

07:01.134 --> 07:03.001
Who the hell are they?
They're Russian
separatists.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.434
They're the terrorists
that were responsible

07:04.500 --> 07:06.234
for the attacks that
took place earlier today.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.700
Does the Navy know
about this?

07:07.767 --> 07:09.167
Yeah. They're sending
in fighters,

07:09.234 --> 07:10.600
but I don't think they're
going to get here in time.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.434
So what are we supposed to do?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.867
Did anyone else from your crew

07:15.934 --> 07:17.234
survive the attack?

07:20.368 --> 07:21.633
No. I don't think so.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.234
Where are you?

07:23.301 --> 07:25.867
Lower Level,
Auxiliary Engineering.

07:25.934 --> 07:27.167
I was down here
doing an inventory

07:27.234 --> 07:28.368
when the alarms
went off.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.633
The atmospheric gauges
red-lined.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.834
It's a sealed compartment,
so I shut it down.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.468
The men that attacked the ship,

07:34.533 --> 07:35.867
were they wearing gas masks?

07:35.934 --> 07:38.234
They were, but they took
them off a few minutes ago.

07:38.301 --> 07:39.867
Okay, good.
That means they

07:39.934 --> 07:41.533
flushed the Sentox
out of the air system.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.167
You should be able
to move around freely.

07:43.234 --> 07:44.800
Hold on one second.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.201
Chloe?
Yes, Jack?

07:46.267 --> 07:48.401
I want you to get me
the nearest entry point

07:48.468 --> 07:50.900
to Petty Officer Rooney's
current position.

07:50.967 --> 07:52.900
The closest hatch
is the forward escape hatch.

07:52.967 --> 07:54.267
Copy that.

07:54.334 --> 07:56.900
Petty Officer Rooney,
do you have a firearm?

07:56.967 --> 07:59.967
No. The armory's
on the other side of the ship.

08:00.034 --> 08:02.633
You need to find something
that you can use as a weapon.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.834
I have a... I have
a utility tool.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.633
It has a knife on it.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.101
That'll work.
I want you to
make your way up

08:08.167 --> 08:10.167
to the Upper Level.
Let me know when
you get there.

08:10.234 --> 08:12.368
You still haven't told me
what it is you want me to do.

08:12.434 --> 08:16.900
I need you to get
to the forward escape
hatch and let us in.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.967
There's a man there guarding it.

08:19.034 --> 08:21.834
Then you're going
to have to kill him.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.101
Petty Officer Rooney?

08:26.167 --> 08:28.001
I'm an engineer.

08:28.067 --> 08:30.301
I... I'm not trained for that.

08:30.368 --> 08:32.101
The men that commandeered
the <i>Natalia</i>

08:32.167 --> 08:33.633
plan to use
its missiles and launch them

08:33.700 --> 08:35.201
on civilian targets
unless we stop them.

08:35.267 --> 08:37.167
You need to make your way
up to the Upper Level.

08:37.234 --> 08:41.201
You need to do it now.
We are running out of time.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.633
I'll contact you
when I get there.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.834
Copy that.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.900
We need to get closer
to the sub. Are you ready?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.034
Jack, I know you got
Malina's .45 in that bag.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.167
Now, give it to me.

09:02.001 --> 09:03.533
Let's go.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.034
We're generating a list

09:08.101 --> 09:10.633
of potential targets, but
frankly, we have no idea

09:10.700 --> 09:11.800
what Bierko
plans to hit.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.267
Are we evacuating
these potential targets?

09:13.334 --> 09:15.900
Don't have time. The missiles
will strike before we can

09:15.967 --> 09:18.368
mobilize even small numbers
of people to the safe zones.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.101
How could this happen, Mike?

09:20.167 --> 09:21.368
How could these people
even access

09:21.434 --> 09:23.134
a submarine
in the first place?

09:23.201 --> 09:25.301
The sub was attacked
when it was being serviced

09:25.368 --> 09:27.301
at a civilian port,

09:27.368 --> 09:29.101
not on a Naval base
where security

09:29.167 --> 09:31.667
would have been
more substantial.

09:31.734 --> 09:34.368
There has to be a way
to destroy that sub

09:34.434 --> 09:36.334
before Bierko can
launch those missiles.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.734
F-18s are scrambling
as we speak.

09:41.234 --> 09:44.167
According to the
latest estimates,

09:44.234 --> 09:46.834
they're not going
to get there in time.

09:54.134 --> 09:56.334
AARON:
Yes?

09:56.401 --> 09:58.967
I'm still waiting
to talk to Mike Novick.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.267
He's in some kind
of crisis meeting.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.867
There's no telling
how long he'll be.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.034
Then I should try to get
off the ranch on my own.

10:05.101 --> 10:07.767
No. Without Mike's help,
you'll be seen.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.934
Charles can't find out
you're still alive.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.234
I'll call you as soon
as I get ahold of Mike.

10:12.301 --> 10:13.301
Okay.

10:20.301 --> 10:21.900
Jack, the missiles
will launch

10:21.967 --> 10:23.667
in less than ten minutes.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.301
Copy that.

10:28.734 --> 10:30.700
How much time do you need
to cancel the launch sequence?

10:30.767 --> 10:32.334
I won't know for
certain until I see

10:32.401 --> 10:34.134
how the targeting
software is configured.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.900
Jack, the Petty Officer
is coming back on.

10:37.967 --> 10:38.934
Patch him through.

10:39.001 --> 10:40.034
Petty Officer Rooney,

10:40.101 --> 10:41.600
you're on with Jack Bauer.

10:41.667 --> 10:42.900
JACK:
What's your position, son?

10:42.967 --> 10:45.734
I'm 30 feet forward
of the hatch.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.334
Have you got a visual of the
hostile guarding the hatch?

10:50.434 --> 10:52.767
Yeah. He's still there.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.001
What do you want me to do?

10:54.067 --> 10:55.101
You need to kill him

10:55.167 --> 10:57.368
without alerting the others.

10:57.434 --> 10:59.368
Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

10:59.434 --> 11:00.500
I'm right-handed.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.001
I want you to approach him
from behind.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.533
When you're within 18 inches,

11:03.600 --> 11:05.001
I want you to take
your left hand,

11:05.067 --> 11:06.867
put it on his mouth,
pull his head back

11:06.934 --> 11:08.301
into your chest
exposing his neck.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.134
Then I want you to take
your right hand

11:10.201 --> 11:11.134
and slit his throat.

11:18.534 --> 11:20.634
I... I don't, uh...

11:20.700 --> 11:22.867
I don't know if I can
do this.

11:22.934 --> 11:25.034
You don't have a choice, son.

11:25.100 --> 11:29.134
I want you to visualize
the hostile down on
the ground, dead.

11:29.201 --> 11:32.067
You cannot afford
to think about this, son.

11:32.134 --> 11:33.568
You need to do it.

11:33.634 --> 11:36.001
Jack, there's less
than six minutes
until the missile launch.

11:36.001 --> 11:39.434
Petty Officer Rooney?

11:44.001 --> 11:46.001
Petty Officer Rooney?

11:46.067 --> 11:48.267
Okay, I can do this.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.867
I have to do this.

11:50.934 --> 11:53.900
Cut him deep,
and cut him fast.

11:53.967 --> 11:55.834
Agent McCullough, cover us.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.334
We're moving in
on the tower.

11:57.401 --> 11:59.368
Go.

12:33.567 --> 12:35.333
Petty Officer Rooney,
what is your status?

12:35.400 --> 12:37.234
My status is, uh...

12:37.300 --> 12:38.400
He's dead.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.134
Did anyone hear you?

12:41.201 --> 12:42.400
No, no one's coming.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.001
Good. Open the hatch.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.734
You ready?
Yeah.

12:53.801 --> 12:55.901
I'll take out the guard.
Let's go.

13:01.168 --> 13:03.300
All right, he's down.
We're going in.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.867
Oh, no.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.367
The sub's missile hatches
just opened.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.400
I see them.

13:24.467 --> 13:25.767
What does that mean

13:25.834 --> 13:27.067
in terms of our time frame?

13:27.134 --> 13:29.667
You have less than four minutes
until they launch.

13:36.634 --> 13:38.534
Are you all right?
I'm okay.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.034
Which way is
the control room?

13:40.101 --> 13:41.001
It's down that hall.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.268
You lead, we'll follow.
Okay.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.567
All right, the control room's
right down that hall.

14:00.634 --> 14:02.467
BAUER:
I'm going to need your help

14:02.534 --> 14:04.034
drawing the rest of the
hostiles out of the con.

14:04.101 --> 14:05.333
What do you want
me to do?

14:05.400 --> 14:06.567
Is there another way for you

14:06.634 --> 14:08.600
to get to the other side
of the control room?

14:08.667 --> 14:10.101
Yeah, I can go down
one level

14:10.168 --> 14:11.500
and then come up
behind them.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.001
Okay, when you get there, I want
you to create a diversion,

14:14.067 --> 14:15.168
something loud.

14:15.234 --> 14:16.734
Just make sure you get
them out of there.

14:16.801 --> 14:18.333
When you do, I want you
to find somewhere

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
to lay low and stay there.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.001
I do not want you
to engage them.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.001
Do you understand me?

14:22.067 --> 14:23.034
Yeah, I can do that.

14:23.101 --> 14:24.567
Go.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.367
With the last
three missiles,

14:45.433 --> 14:47.734
make sure you overlap
these populations centers

14:47.801 --> 14:49.467
in San Francisco.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.500
Locking up

14:54.567 --> 14:56.201
GPS coordinates,
sir.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.667
Keep working.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.201
Did you hear that?
Yes, sir.

15:19.268 --> 15:21.168
Down there.
Come with me,
both of you.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.300
The control room's
right behind us.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.534
I have a visual
on one hostile.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.001
Agent McCullough, I'm going
to move into position.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.901
When he's directly
above me,

15:59.967 --> 16:01.034
signal me
with the mirror.

16:36.634 --> 16:38.600
CHLOE:
Jack, the missiles are armed.

16:38.667 --> 16:40.067
Three minutes to launch.

16:51.234 --> 16:52.967
We're all clear.

17:10.901 --> 17:13.333
Jack, I'm gonna have to manually
reverse all these codes.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.433
Do you have enough time?
I'll do my best.
I don't want to be in here

17:16.500 --> 17:19.268
any more than you
if those F-18s
take out this sub.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.268
We're going to keep Bierko
and his men out of here

17:21.333 --> 17:23.167
so you can finish this.
Let's go.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.234
( <i>yells</i> )

18:12.268 --> 18:14.134
Agent McCullough's down.

18:14.201 --> 18:16.134
Bierko and one hostile
remaining.

18:16.201 --> 18:17.500
Henderson, what
is your status?

18:17.567 --> 18:20.867
Jack, I need more time.
You've got to hold them off.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.201
60 seconds until they launch.

18:54.101 --> 18:55.034
( <i>groaning</i> )

18:55.101 --> 18:56.168
Jack?

18:57.767 --> 18:59.400
Hang on, Jack.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.300
CHLOE:
30 seconds to launch.

19:06.001 --> 19:07.001
( <i>screaming</i> )

19:09.168 --> 19:11.333
It's almost there, Jack.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Four more seconds.

19:22.234 --> 19:23.234
CHLOE:
Ten seconds.

19:27.001 --> 19:28.767
It's done.

19:31.534 --> 19:32.867
( <i>bones cracking</i> )

19:40.300 --> 19:42.234
HENDERSON:
The launch sequence is canceled.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.001
I repeat,
the launch sequence is canceled.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.967
Audrey, recall the F-18's.
I'm on it.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.667
Bierko's dead.

19:49.734 --> 19:51.634
The submarine is secure.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.734
HENDERSON:
Jack, are you okay?

19:52.801 --> 19:54.367
Bill, I'm fine.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.934
I'm getting a lot
of feedback.

19:59.001 --> 20:00.234
Take me off the com.

20:19.834 --> 20:23.268
Hold it, Jack.

20:23.333 --> 20:26.168
Now lower your arms

20:26.234 --> 20:28.433
real slow

20:28.500 --> 20:30.867
and turn around.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.500
You were never really going

20:35.567 --> 20:37.801
to let me go, were you?

20:37.867 --> 20:39.400
No.

20:43.101 --> 20:45.134
( <i>clicks</i> )

21:01.034 --> 21:04.333
Good for you, Jack.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.400
You were responsible for
the deaths

21:10.467 --> 21:13.700
of David Palmer, Tony Almeida

21:13.767 --> 21:16.367
and Michelle Dessler.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.500
They were friends of mine.

21:22.901 --> 21:25.367
That's the way it works.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.200
Identify yourself!

22:16.267 --> 22:17.500
My name is Jack Bauer,

22:17.567 --> 22:19.801
with the Counter-
Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles!

22:19.867 --> 22:22.001
All the hostiles are dead!

22:22.068 --> 22:23.767
Holster your weapons!

22:25.901 --> 22:26.867
Sir, you need to contact

22:26.934 --> 22:28.567
Bill Buchanan-- immediately.

22:28.634 --> 22:31.701
Okay. Lieutenant, I need
access to a vehicle.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.701
Petty Officer,
get me a vehicle-- <i>now!</i>

22:33.767 --> 22:34.968
Thank you.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.534
BUCHANAN:
Jack?
Yeah.

22:40.601 --> 22:41.968
I've been told
the Navy's running

22:42.034 --> 22:43.233
cleanup and security on the sub.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.834
Yeah, they're here now.

22:44.901 --> 22:46.367
Bill, Christopher
Henderson is dead.

22:46.434 --> 22:48.068
What? What happened?

22:48.133 --> 22:49.100
He fired on me.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.801
I didn't have a choice.

22:53.867 --> 22:55.734
Are you coming back to CTU?

22:55.801 --> 22:57.200
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

22:57.267 --> 22:58.467
All right, we'll see you then.

22:58.534 --> 23:01.034
Chloe, the Navy needs our access
codes to our logs

23:01.100 --> 23:02.667
so they can use them
for their report.

23:02.734 --> 23:03.667
Can you pick up?

23:03.734 --> 23:04.767
Yeah.

23:04.834 --> 23:06.200
What codes do they need?

23:06.267 --> 23:08.567
They don't. Get somewhere
where you won't be overheard.

23:08.634 --> 23:11.267
I'll have to get that
from my screen.

23:11.334 --> 23:12.467
Let me get back

23:12.534 --> 23:13.500
to my station.

23:24.434 --> 23:25.701
I'm here.

23:25.767 --> 23:26.867
What's going on?

23:26.934 --> 23:28.167
I'm not coming
back to CTU.

23:28.233 --> 23:29.467
I'm going after Logan.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.968
What do you mean,
going after Logan?

23:31.034 --> 23:32.601
I'll fill you in
on the details later.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.667
Right now I need you
to walk me through modifying

23:34.734 --> 23:36.534
some field
communications equipment.

23:36.601 --> 23:39.001
That's not exactly
my area, Jack.

23:39.068 --> 23:40.500
Then you'll need
to get some help.

23:42.267 --> 23:43.267
Chloe,

23:43.334 --> 23:45.300
are you with me on this?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.400
Yeah. What do you need?

23:50.467 --> 23:53.034
Hold on, I'll give you a list.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.467
Okay.

23:56.534 --> 23:57.867
Thank you.

23:59.267 --> 24:01.968
We're certain the missiles
no longer pose a threat?

24:02.034 --> 24:03.667
Yes, Mr. President.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.601
We have complete control
over the boat.

24:05.667 --> 24:09.167
Vladimir Bierko and all his
known associates are dead

24:09.233 --> 24:11.500
or in custody.

24:13.767 --> 24:16.167
So then it's all over, Mike.

24:16.233 --> 24:17.233
It's over.

24:23.233 --> 24:24.567
( <i>sighs</i> )

24:34.233 --> 24:36.634
I need to make a statement
before I go back to Washington.

24:36.701 --> 24:39.701
About the successful
resolution of the crisis.

24:39.767 --> 24:40.734
Yes.

24:40.801 --> 24:43.068
And about David Palmer.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.467
Sir?

24:44.534 --> 24:47.001
David's casket is being flown
to Arlington for burial,

24:47.068 --> 24:48.300
and I would like to say

24:48.367 --> 24:50.634
a few words alongside it
at the airfield,

24:50.701 --> 24:52.767
and then I'll fly
back to Washington.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.667
I'll get to work
on it right away.

24:56.734 --> 24:58.601
Good. Thank you, Mike.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.534
For everything.

25:05.801 --> 25:07.667
It's been a hell of a day.

25:07.734 --> 25:10.367
Yes, sir.

25:10.434 --> 25:11.867
It has.

25:24.068 --> 25:25.068
Mike.

25:26.767 --> 25:27.934
You need to come with me.

25:28.001 --> 25:29.200
Come with you?

25:29.267 --> 25:32.167
Please.

25:32.233 --> 25:33.434
Oh, please.

25:36.267 --> 25:38.233
Mrs. Logan,
have you been...?
No.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.434
I've never been more sober.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.434
Or more sane.

25:49.001 --> 25:50.767
What's this about?

25:50.834 --> 25:52.001
My husband.

25:52.068 --> 25:53.100
What about him?

25:53.167 --> 25:54.634
Mike, I know
you've been troubled

25:54.701 --> 25:56.001
by Charles's actions today.

25:56.068 --> 26:00.034
You <i>know</i> that something
is terribly, terribly wrong.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.701
You just can't put
your finger on it.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.867
Okay.

26:05.934 --> 26:08.400
Tell me what this is about.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.100
No, I'm going to show you.

26:10.167 --> 26:12.233
It'll explain everything.
Please come.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.734
The mission to retake the
submarine has been successful.

26:15.801 --> 26:17.567
Hmm, so I understand.

26:17.634 --> 26:20.068
You'll also be interested
to know Christopher Henderson

26:20.133 --> 26:22.834
was killed during the operation.

26:22.901 --> 26:24.267
You're certain of this?

26:24.334 --> 26:27.167
CTU has confirmed
the information.

26:28.901 --> 26:30.367
That's excellent.

26:30.434 --> 26:32.834
But let's not fool
ourselves into thinking

26:32.901 --> 26:34.300
that's the end
of all our problems.

26:34.367 --> 26:35.934
There's still Bauer
to deal with.

26:36.001 --> 26:38.400
Don't worry.

26:38.467 --> 26:40.767
Mr. Bauer will
be taken care of.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.901
Good.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.133
Mike. Over here.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.968
Aaron...

26:52.034 --> 26:53.400
What happened to you?

26:53.467 --> 26:55.200
Agent Adams tried to kill me.

26:55.267 --> 26:57.434
On the president's orders.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.200
That doesn't
make any sense.

27:01.867 --> 27:03.167
Where is Agent Adams?

27:13.767 --> 27:16.500
Mike, we need your help.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.901
God.

27:18.968 --> 27:20.534
What the hell's going on here?

27:23.034 --> 27:25.767
The president had something
to do with this?

27:25.834 --> 27:26.767
Everything.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.367
He was involved
with <i>everything</i>

27:28.434 --> 27:29.701
that happened today--

27:29.767 --> 27:31.667
supplying the terrorists
with the nerve gas,

27:31.734 --> 27:33.233
the murder of David Palmer.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.167
( <i>sighs</i> )

27:36.233 --> 27:37.334
But Walt Cummings?

27:37.400 --> 27:39.133
Walt was just their scapegoat.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.500
He didn't commit suicide.

27:41.567 --> 27:43.734
He was murdered by a man
who works for Charles.

27:43.801 --> 27:46.500
Charles told me
to be quiet.

27:46.567 --> 27:47.734
For the good of the country.

27:47.801 --> 27:49.300
Keep my mouth shut.

27:49.367 --> 27:51.434
I can't do that.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.601
Not anymore.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.767
Do you have proof?

27:56.834 --> 27:57.767
Jack Bauer was

27:57.834 --> 27:59.200
in possession
of a recording

27:59.267 --> 28:00.434
that implicated
the president.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.734
That's why Logan
was willing

28:02.801 --> 28:05.534
to go so far as to shoot
a plane full of people down--

28:05.601 --> 28:07.801
because Jack was on it.

28:07.867 --> 28:09.734
Well, where is
this recording?

28:09.801 --> 28:11.167
It's been destroyed.

28:12.534 --> 28:13.701
I didn't want

28:13.767 --> 28:15.434
to believe it
either, Mike,

28:15.500 --> 28:17.267
but it's the truth,
so help me God.

28:23.968 --> 28:26.133
All right.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.867
If this is true,
we need to find another way

28:28.934 --> 28:31.034
to make a case
against the president.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.167
You're right, but first

28:33.233 --> 28:35.434
we have to get
Aaron off the ranch.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.100
There can't be
a record of it.

28:42.167 --> 28:44.100
All right. You're right.

28:44.167 --> 28:45.300
We need to move fast.

28:45.367 --> 28:47.100
I know the men at the
Western Gate well.

28:47.167 --> 28:49.068
They won't stop and
inspect the vehicle

28:49.133 --> 28:51.034
if I'm driving.
You'll hide in the back

28:51.100 --> 28:52.034
out of sight.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.001
Thank you, Mike.

28:53.068 --> 28:54.500
Give me the keys.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.300
Aaron.

29:04.467 --> 29:07.133
I'll be fine.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.267
I'll go somewhere where your
husband's people can't find me.

29:10.334 --> 29:13.567
But will you let me know
that you're all right?

29:13.634 --> 29:18.133
It's probably safer
if we don't have any contact.

29:23.968 --> 29:26.133
Good-bye, Aaron.

29:31.867 --> 29:33.701
Thank you.

30:15.567 --> 30:16.701
Mike Novick.

30:16.767 --> 30:18.033
Mike, it's Jack Bauer.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.501
I know this is
an unusual request,

30:19.567 --> 30:21.100
but I'm looking
for Aaron Pierce.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.601
I've been trying
to reach him on his cell,
but he's not answering.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.501
It's Jack Bauer.
He's trying
to find you.

30:25.567 --> 30:26.968
Can you put him
on speaker?

30:27.033 --> 30:30.200
Aaron's with me right
now, Jack. Hold on.

30:30.267 --> 30:33.634
It's all right, Jack. You can
speak freely in front of Mike.

30:33.701 --> 30:34.767
He knows what I know.

30:34.834 --> 30:35.968
Aaron, where are you?

30:36.033 --> 30:37.434
A few miles from the ranch.

30:37.501 --> 30:38.434
What happened?

30:38.501 --> 30:41.334
The president tried
to have me killed,

30:41.400 --> 30:43.067
but Mrs. Logan
saved my life.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.234
She and I both decided
to bring Mike
into this.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.434
And I'm still
trying to process everything they told me.

30:47.501 --> 30:48.667
This is a real
mess, Jack.

30:48.734 --> 30:50.501
Mike, I'm calling Aaron
because I need his help.

30:50.567 --> 30:51.701
I need yours, too.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.567
Help with what?

30:53.634 --> 30:55.901
Bringing President Logan
to justice.

30:55.968 --> 30:58.167
Well, Aaron said
the recording you had

30:58.234 --> 31:01.033
implicating the president
was destroyed. Is that true?

31:01.100 --> 31:02.167
Yes.

31:02.234 --> 31:03.901
Well, without it you
can't mount a case.

31:03.968 --> 31:06.334
I can if I can get
a direct confession from Logan.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.267
I'm working with someone
inside CTU.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.801
They're setting up
a digital uplink.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.701
If I can get Logan
to acknowledge everything

31:11.767 --> 31:13.133
that he's done today,
it's going to be all the evidence
we need.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.767
Jack, if you intend to
physically coerce the president
of the United States...

31:17.834 --> 31:19.334
<i>Mike, we need to do this now.</i>

31:19.400 --> 31:21.200
The longer we wait,
the more vulnerable we are.

31:21.267 --> 31:23.667
President Logan tried to take me
out, just like he did Aaron.

31:23.734 --> 31:26.100
I don't need to remind you
that he was responsible

31:26.167 --> 31:27.334
for David Palmer's assassination

31:27.400 --> 31:29.501
and a terrorist attack
on this country's soil.

31:29.567 --> 31:31.334
He cannot be allowed
to remain in office,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.567
not for one more day.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.434
How long will it
take you to get here?

31:35.501 --> 31:36.634
20 minutes.

31:36.701 --> 31:37.734
That's too late.

31:37.801 --> 31:39.534
President Logan
will be gone.

31:39.601 --> 31:41.901
He's leaving for Washington
around that time.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.367
Then you have to try
and delay him.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.667
I'm not sure
I can do that.

31:44.734 --> 31:46.434
Mike, just tell me you'll try.

31:48.834 --> 31:50.634
All right.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.133
But get here as fast as you can.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.200
Okay. Thank you.

31:56.868 --> 31:58.467
Yes, sir. I'll get on a plane

31:58.534 --> 32:00.868
as soon as I finish
our debrief with the Navy.

32:11.267 --> 32:12.801
Homeland's ordered me to
Washington

32:12.868 --> 32:14.334
as soon as I file
the Bierko case.

32:15.868 --> 32:19.167
Apparently, the request
came from the White House.

32:19.234 --> 32:21.567
Logan's looking
for an excuse to clean house.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.634
I'm sure I'll be next.

32:26.767 --> 32:27.968
HAYES:
Come in.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.234
Yes, Chloe.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.367
Do you have
something?

32:31.434 --> 32:32.400
I need an authorization code.

32:32.467 --> 32:33.400
For what?

32:33.467 --> 32:34.501
I need access to

32:34.567 --> 32:35.734
a high-clearance
workstation.

32:35.801 --> 32:37.267
You already have access.

32:37.334 --> 32:38.734
It's for some new personnel.

32:38.801 --> 32:40.501
What?

32:40.567 --> 32:43.400
Morris?

32:43.467 --> 32:45.000
You're bringing Morris back?

32:45.067 --> 32:46.467
Yes.

32:46.534 --> 32:47.634
Why, Chloe?

32:47.701 --> 32:49.133
Because I'm still trying
to salvage something

32:49.200 --> 32:50.667
from the recording
that Miles erased.

32:50.734 --> 32:51.934
If anyone can do it,
it's Morris.

32:52.033 --> 32:53.767
I didn't think Morris

32:53.834 --> 32:55.400
was even on the government
payroll anymore.

32:55.467 --> 32:57.367
He's not.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.701
What's he doing?

32:58.767 --> 33:01.334
He's selling women's
shoes in Beverly Hills.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.701
What?

33:02.767 --> 33:04.000
Is this a joke?

33:04.067 --> 33:05.968
No. You know I wouldn't
have brought him in

33:06.033 --> 33:07.334
if there was anyone
else I could call.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.501
Please, Mr. Buchanan.

33:16.534 --> 33:18.067
Thank you.

33:19.434 --> 33:21.300
Bill...

33:21.367 --> 33:23.200
It's going to be
all right.
Who is this guy?

33:23.267 --> 33:25.234
Morris O'Brian.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.334
Chloe's ex-husband.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.501
No, no, not like that.
May I?

33:30.567 --> 33:32.801
See, the beauty of the beast is
if you leave these fields blank,

33:32.868 --> 33:34.300
it'll prompt you
for a code.

33:34.367 --> 33:35.667
Ba-bing. See that?

33:35.734 --> 33:37.100
You just saved
60 seconds.

33:37.167 --> 33:39.300
Ten of those a day,
that's an extra cigarette break

33:39.367 --> 33:42.501
or whatever it is you do
to take the edge off.

33:42.567 --> 33:43.601
Morris.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.467
What are you doing?

33:47.534 --> 33:48.701
Just making your people
more efficient.

33:48.767 --> 33:50.834
I noticed you picked
the most attractive one.

33:50.901 --> 33:54.100
Wrong. You're the most
attractive one.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.501
Here's your clearance.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.334
I'm surprised you got
Bill Buchanan to sign off on me.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.000
You know, this is a really
good opportunity for you.

34:01.067 --> 34:03.267
Why don't you surprise me
and not totally screw it up?

34:03.334 --> 34:05.400
Okay.
I'm going to pretend

34:05.467 --> 34:07.667
that this will require
all my focus and attention,

34:07.734 --> 34:10.601
even though we both know
I can do it in my sleep.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.000
Sit down.

34:12.067 --> 34:14.333
So where is this recording
you want me to resurrect?

34:14.400 --> 34:15.501
Nothing. Forget it.
It's fried.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.534
I'm missing something.

34:17.601 --> 34:19.601
You said you wanted me to
salvage a digital recording.

34:19.667 --> 34:21.100
That was an excuse.

34:21.167 --> 34:23.266
I need some comm unit
modifications.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.833
I need a certified digital
audio transfer rate of 6.8.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.167
I can only get to 6.5.

34:27.234 --> 34:28.601
Can you do that
without talking?

34:28.667 --> 34:31.400
I could, but it'd be
a terrible waste of my charm.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.934
Okay. I'm not
listening anymore.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.601
Call me when you're done.

34:36.667 --> 34:37.833
Thanks.

34:41.801 --> 34:43.601
Behind me, you can see
preparations

34:43.667 --> 34:46.367
as the casket bearing the body
of David Palmer

34:46.434 --> 34:48.868
is due here shortly.
It will be met

34:48.934 --> 34:50.967
<i>by President Logan
who is scheduled
( knock on door )</i>

34:51.033 --> 34:54.167
to make a statement before
he flies back to Washington...

34:55.467 --> 34:56.766
Is Aaron safe?

34:56.833 --> 34:57.834
Yes.

34:57.901 --> 35:00.133
Thank God.

35:03.067 --> 35:05.067
I can't believe Charles
is going to do this.

35:05.133 --> 35:07.000
He has David's blood
on his hand,

35:07.067 --> 35:08.534
he has the audacity
to eulogize him

35:08.601 --> 35:10.334
in front of
the whole world.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.834
Mrs. Logan...

35:11.901 --> 35:13.234
I said earlier
there was no way

35:13.300 --> 35:14.701
to make a case against
your husband.

35:14.767 --> 35:16.434
I was wrong.

35:16.501 --> 35:18.868
Jack Bauer,
the former CTU agent,

35:18.934 --> 35:21.300
contacted Aaron and me.
He's on his way here now.

35:21.367 --> 35:22.834
What for?

35:22.901 --> 35:25.601
He's going to confront
your husband directly.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.167
Confront him?

35:27.234 --> 35:29.200
What's he going to do?

35:29.267 --> 35:30.901
Jack Bauer will do
whatever it takes

35:30.968 --> 35:34.000
to compel your husband
to confess the truth.

35:34.067 --> 35:36.434
He's the only one I know
who can do this.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.100
When will he be here?

35:38.167 --> 35:39.467
15 minutes.

35:39.534 --> 35:42.167
But Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

35:42.234 --> 35:44.133
I know, I know, I tried
to delay him myself,

35:44.200 --> 35:45.501
but he wouldn't
change his schedule.

35:45.567 --> 35:46.801
That's why I'm coming to you.

35:46.868 --> 35:49.701
I need you
to keep him here.

35:54.334 --> 35:55.501
Martha...

35:55.567 --> 35:59.667
if you want your husband
brought to justice,

35:59.734 --> 36:01.934
this is our only chance.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.234
You have to find
a way to stall him.

36:36.801 --> 36:38.067
Aaron, it's good
to see you.

36:38.134 --> 36:39.367
Same here, Jack.

36:39.433 --> 36:41.567
Was Mike able to delay
the President?
He's trying.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.700
But he had to ask
Mrs. Logan for some help.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.901
The First Lady knows
what we intend to do?

36:45.967 --> 36:46.967
She does.

36:47.034 --> 36:48.433
Aaron...

36:48.500 --> 36:49.634
can she be trusted?

36:49.700 --> 36:51.367
She is with us, Jack...

36:51.433 --> 36:52.400
100%.

36:52.467 --> 36:53.801
Can you still get access

36:53.867 --> 36:55.867
to the Secret Service
deployment grid?
I already have.

36:55.934 --> 36:57.967
The way security has been beefed
up around the main building,

36:58.034 --> 36:59.433
there's no way you're
going to be able

36:59.500 --> 37:00.467
to get Logan alone there.

37:00.534 --> 37:02.067
Is Marine One taking him
to the airfield?

37:02.134 --> 37:03.433
No, this was last minute.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.201
They're transporting him
by reduced detachment.

37:05.268 --> 37:06.400
They're using
a Navy helicopter.

37:06.467 --> 37:07.901
That's where this
has to happen.

37:07.967 --> 37:09.433
I need to get on
that chopper.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.767
I don't see how that's
going to be possible.

37:11.834 --> 37:14.234
Aaron, you get me as close
to that helicopter as you can

37:14.300 --> 37:16.567
and then we'll figure
it out from there.

37:16.634 --> 37:17.667
All right.

37:17.734 --> 37:19.168
Let's go.

37:20.967 --> 37:24.333
Yes, I agree, Wayne Palmer
should be at the airfield.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.134
But if you can't find him,
I'm not going to wait for him.

37:29.034 --> 37:31.634
Yes, I'm leaving now.

37:34.567 --> 37:37.168
Have a copy of my speech
on the chopper,

37:37.234 --> 37:40.534
and I'll work on it
on the flight over.

37:44.101 --> 37:46.001
I'll be out of your way
in a second.

37:46.067 --> 37:47.967
I saw on your schedule

37:48.034 --> 37:50.268
that you're meeting
David Palmer's

37:50.333 --> 37:51.801
casket at the airfield.

37:54.534 --> 37:56.333
If you came here to judge me,
Martha,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.268
I really don't have time...

37:58.333 --> 37:59.367
No, no.

37:59.433 --> 38:01.634
That's not it.

38:02.967 --> 38:04.268
I've had time

38:04.333 --> 38:06.034
to reflect and I...

38:06.101 --> 38:08.333
I think I owe you an apology.

38:13.268 --> 38:14.500
All right.

38:15.967 --> 38:18.400
I said some horrible things
to you.

38:18.467 --> 38:22.534
I've had horrible things
said to me before...

38:22.600 --> 38:24.400
and by you.

38:25.801 --> 38:29.567
But there was one thing you
said that I can't get over.

38:29.634 --> 38:30.801
What?

38:30.867 --> 38:33.168
That I broke your heart...

38:33.234 --> 38:35.400
and that you hated me.

38:37.634 --> 38:40.201
Well, I wish I could
take those words back.

38:40.268 --> 38:44.034
All I can ask now
is that you forgive me.

38:44.101 --> 38:46.634
Please, Charles...

38:51.901 --> 38:55.400
I don't know how
to respond, Marty.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.567
I never expected you
to say anything like this.

39:01.134 --> 39:03.201
I mean it, Charles, I...

39:05.333 --> 39:07.734
I mean it,
I need you to forgive me.

39:07.801 --> 39:10.300
You mean it now,
but you know how you are.

39:10.367 --> 39:13.201
By tomorrow, I could be
the man you hate again.

39:15.201 --> 39:16.467
I know.

39:19.634 --> 39:22.101
It'll take time for me
to prove myself to you,

39:22.168 --> 39:25.567
but the truth is...

39:25.634 --> 39:30.168
even though sometimes
I don't understand you,

39:30.234 --> 39:32.067
I still need you.

39:34.433 --> 39:37.234
And I still love you.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.034
And that will never
change, Charles.

39:40.101 --> 39:44.734
Not tomorrow, not ever.

39:48.367 --> 39:52.734
I need you, too, Marty.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.801
Fly with me
to Washington.

40:07.300 --> 40:09.500
We can spend
some time together.

40:09.567 --> 40:12.667
On a plane surrounded
by Secret Service?

40:12.734 --> 40:16.367
Why can't we just spend
a little more time here,

40:16.433 --> 40:18.134
together, alone?

40:18.201 --> 40:20.433
You know that's
not possible.
I have to go.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.867
I had to go
five minutes ago.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.168
Okay, Charles.

40:31.234 --> 40:34.700
You go.

40:45.867 --> 40:47.168
Come with me.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.400
I have a better idea.

40:56.867 --> 40:58.734
There's a helicopter
waiting for me.

40:58.801 --> 40:59.901
Let it wait.

40:59.967 --> 41:01.634
I can't.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.333
Yes, you can.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.767
You're the President.

41:36.734 --> 41:39.300
Tell the helicopter
to stand by.

41:39.367 --> 41:40.867
Yes.

41:40.934 --> 41:42.400
Until I'm ready.

41:44.067 --> 41:46.101
And make sure
I'm not disturbed.

42:28.268 --> 42:30.234
It's clear.

42:33.867 --> 42:36.767
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

42:38.001 --> 42:39.134
Yeah.

42:39.201 --> 42:40.801
The President just notified
Secret Service

42:40.867 --> 42:42.967
he's going
to be delayed.
How long?

42:43.034 --> 42:44.300
He didn't say.

42:44.367 --> 42:47.467
But Mrs. Logan knows we need
as much time as possible.

42:47.534 --> 42:48.934
Jack...

42:49.001 --> 42:51.834
if Logan doesn't confess,

42:51.901 --> 42:53.934
how far are you actually
willing to go?

42:54.001 --> 42:55.901
As far as I have to.
