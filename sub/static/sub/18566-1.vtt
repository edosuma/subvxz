00:20.593 --> 00:23.563
This is LA 1-6 in pursuit
of a robbery suspect.

00:23.596 --> 00:25.763
East of Crenshaw and Slauson Boulevard.

00:30.103 --> 00:31.538
Whoo!

00:31.571 --> 00:33.874
This cop can kiss my ass!

00:43.149 --> 00:45.109
Jack, I think I can do a pin on this guy

00:45.118 --> 00:46.653
if I can get a little closer.

00:46.686 --> 00:49.089
Man, just hold it steady.

00:49.122 --> 00:50.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50.223 --> 00:51.391
Not a good idea, big guy.

00:51.424 --> 00:53.126
I said hold it steady!

00:55.163 --> 00:56.663
He's pullin' out a gun, TJ.

00:56.696 --> 00:57.974
Well, pull yours, Bobo.

01:10.143 --> 01:11.445
Got his butt

01:49.515 --> 01:51.385
Get out of the vehicle!

01:56.055 --> 01:57.222
They're not in there.

02:36.462 --> 02:38.031
Just let the lady go.

02:38.064 --> 02:39.366
Shut up!

02:39.399 --> 02:41.534
Hey, punks! Give it up.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.670
Surrender right now, nobody have to die.

02:43.703 --> 02:45.538
Please don't let him hurt me.

02:45.571 --> 02:46.372
Shut up.

02:46.405 --> 02:47.540
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, ma'am.

02:47.573 --> 02:50.010
Hey, what do you know? Sshh.

02:50.043 --> 02:51.678
- Maybe I'll just kill her for the fun of it.
- No.

02:51.711 --> 02:55.181
Nobody gonna hurt you,
because he's a coward.

02:55.214 --> 02:57.183
I'm a what?

02:57.216 --> 03:00.120
Hey, are you stupid or just crazy?

03:00.153 --> 03:01.121
You want me to kill her?

03:01.154 --> 03:03.089
Like I said before,

03:03.122 --> 03:04.791
he's a bitch-ass coward.

03:04.824 --> 03:07.193
Justice, you're not making this any easier.

03:07.226 --> 03:08.228
Justice...

03:08.261 --> 03:10.030
is that your name?

03:10.063 --> 03:11.498
You were born to be a pig, huh?

03:11.531 --> 03:13.500
Guess I was.

03:13.533 --> 03:14.734
Well, put down your guns

03:14.767 --> 03:16.436
and walk my fine ass out of here.

03:16.469 --> 03:18.104
You know we can't do that, man.

03:18.137 --> 03:19.339
Just let the lady go

03:19.372 --> 03:20.652
and make this easier on yourself.

03:20.673 --> 03:22.742
Shut up!

03:22.775 --> 03:24.331
I got... I got control here.

03:25.679 --> 03:27.247
You want me to shoot you too?

03:27.280 --> 03:29.649
Like he said, partner...

03:29.682 --> 03:30.684
put the gun down.

03:34.487 --> 03:35.654
You too, put it down.

03:39.692 --> 03:41.061
There you go.

03:41.094 --> 03:42.295
Slide it over.

03:51.637 --> 03:52.639
Yeah, Bobo!

03:52.839 --> 03:54.374
Whoo! We got this guy!

03:59.579 --> 04:00.580
Man.

04:08.621 --> 04:09.823
Open the door.

04:22.502 --> 04:23.703
You're crazy.

04:23.736 --> 04:25.105
Don't make me shoot you, man.

04:25.138 --> 04:26.006
Stop, just stop right there,

04:26.039 --> 04:28.262
I'm gonna, I don't wanna' shoot you man.

04:39.685 --> 04:41.888
Jack! Jack!

04:41.921 --> 04:44.191
- Jack, Jack, Jack.
- That's enough.

04:49.595 --> 04:51.764
What the fuck are you doin'?

04:51.797 --> 04:54.834
What the fuck is wrong with you?

04:54.867 --> 04:57.804
You cannot take the law
into your own fucking hands.

04:57.837 --> 05:00.340
I can't keep cleaning up your shit.

05:01.674 --> 05:03.209
I'm suspending you.

05:03.242 --> 05:07.814
I want you to go away, go far fucking away.

05:07.847 --> 05:09.649
I'll clean this shit up.

08:01.321 --> 08:03.323
I'm telling you,
he sounded like a little girl.

08:03.356 --> 08:04.490
It was pathetic.

08:04.523 --> 08:05.792
So I told him to shut the hell up.

08:05.825 --> 08:07.827
"They're all over me."

08:07.860 --> 08:09.062
I'm thinking he's snake-bit

08:09.095 --> 08:10.563
or he walked into a hornet's nest.

08:10.596 --> 08:13.900
No, a squirrel had run up his pant leg.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.069
<i>"The varmint was going for my nuts!"
- His peanuts.</i>

08:16.102 --> 08:18.538
Good day, gentlemen.

08:20.072 --> 08:21.841
Now it's a good day.

08:24.777 --> 08:27.447
What was so funny?

08:27.480 --> 08:28.748
Wouldn't you like to know?

08:28.781 --> 08:31.351
We were just talking about nuts.

08:31.384 --> 08:32.986
You like nuts, Alexa?

08:34.886 --> 08:37.357
I work with you guys, don't I?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.624
Them ain't the type of nuts

08:38.657 --> 08:41.626
we're talking about, Alexa darling.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.062
Alexa darling?

08:43.095 --> 08:45.631
Why doesn't anybody ever
say "Boyd darling"?

08:45.664 --> 08:48.668
Boyd, I believe you're half homo.

08:48.701 --> 08:49.936
Uh, no.

08:49.969 --> 08:51.971
Total faggot.

08:56.709 --> 09:00.780
Yeah, I'm about 30 away.

09:00.813 --> 09:01.714
I was so scared.

09:01.748 --> 09:04.084
And all the stuff I see on TV didn't help.

09:05.385 --> 09:07.453
I told you not to be watching that stuff.

09:07.486 --> 09:09.655
<i>Santana, you're driving me crazy.</i>

09:09.688 --> 09:12.492
Well, no need to worry. I'm almost home.

09:12.525 --> 09:15.661
Hey, I have a surprise for you.

09:15.694 --> 09:16.996
I don't care about that.

09:17.029 --> 09:18.998
Just get home.

09:19.031 --> 09:21.754
And you shouldn't be
video-chatting while driving.

09:24.136 --> 09:25.805
You got to be kidding me.

09:29.108 --> 09:30.977
Baby, hold on.

09:31.010 --> 09:34.013
What? Wait. I need to tell you something.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.720
Oh, you motherfuckers.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.490
If you're not working on a case,

09:44.523 --> 09:46.192
you need to get your
asses out into the field

09:46.225 --> 09:47.427
and write some tickets.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.628
Let's go.

09:48.661 --> 09:49.729
You got anything for me, Hannah?

09:49.762 --> 09:51.831
- I sure do.
- Oh, thank you.

09:51.864 --> 09:55.935
At least somebody's doing
their job around here.

09:55.968 --> 09:58.638
Hey, where are Clark and Holtz?

09:58.671 --> 10:01.941
They're on the old road,
Santana's due in today.

10:01.974 --> 10:03.810
Get out.

10:03.843 --> 10:05.445
How come they're out on the old road?

10:05.478 --> 10:07.747
You're supposed to be out on the old road.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.048
Nothing? And what is with your hair?

10:09.081 --> 10:10.149
I told you to get it cut.

10:10.182 --> 10:11.951
After the rodeo, Sheriff.

10:11.984 --> 10:13.953
It gets me laid.

10:13.986 --> 10:15.455
Where's Stuckey?

10:15.488 --> 10:17.023
He's in the can.

10:17.056 --> 10:18.656
How come your badge is on the wrong side?

10:18.657 --> 10:19.792
It's supposed to be over there.

10:19.825 --> 10:21.527
<i>McCain lost his.</i>

10:21.560 --> 10:24.005
- Sheriff, can I have a minute with you?
- What?

10:25.264 --> 10:26.966
Yeah.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.067
File that.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.039
We got shit to do, Boyd.

10:33.072 --> 10:34.474
Yeah.

10:34.507 --> 10:35.708
Hey!

10:35.741 --> 10:36.976
When am I gonna get my phone call?

10:37.009 --> 10:38.678
I told you, later.

10:38.711 --> 10:41.600
Sheriff, man,
this guy ain't gonna give me the phone.

10:43.215 --> 10:44.827
You won't give him the phone.

10:47.286 --> 10:48.788
Make your damn phone call.

10:51.290 --> 10:52.792
What the hell is it, Boyd?
What do you want?

10:52.825 --> 10:53.726
I'm a busy man.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.995
Sir, it's about this piece of shit bonus.

10:56.028 --> 10:56.762
For everything we're bringing in,

10:56.796 --> 11:00.700
it ought be more, a lot more.

11:00.733 --> 11:02.068
Oh, is that right?

11:02.101 --> 11:03.102
Yes, sir.

11:03.135 --> 11:04.270
It ought to be a lot more.

11:04.303 --> 11:05.605
Believe so-

11:05.638 --> 11:07.206
Let me tell you something.

11:07.239 --> 11:09.976
You are damn lucky that
I'm not a violent man.

11:10.009 --> 11:12.678
Now you happen to be the worst of my bunch.

11:12.711 --> 11:14.213
Don't make me sorry you're here.

11:14.246 --> 11:16.015
Okay?

11:16.048 --> 11:17.717
Do we have an issue?

11:17.750 --> 11:19.685
No. No issue.

11:19.718 --> 11:22.054
Good, good to hear.

11:22.087 --> 11:23.189
What do you want?

11:23.222 --> 11:25.691
The Mayor's here to see you.

11:25.724 --> 11:27.594
Thank you.

11:29.061 --> 11:30.163
Go.

11:31.664 --> 11:33.944
You need to give the
prisoners their phone call.

11:33.966 --> 11:34.968
Yes, sir.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.209
What?

11:43.242 --> 11:45.645
Don't give me that look.

11:45.678 --> 11:47.247
Don't fuck this up, Boyd.

11:51.984 --> 11:53.553
Whatever.

11:57.289 --> 11:59.859
Mayor Dorsey, you wanted to see me.
What's up?

11:59.892 --> 12:02.728
We've got a situation here.
That's what's up.

12:02.761 --> 12:06.699
Huh. - There's just a few days
away from the festival starting.

12:06.732 --> 12:09.168
I can't have happening this
year what we had last year.

12:09.201 --> 12:12.004
Can you remind me what that was?

12:12.037 --> 12:13.773
Posts!

12:13.806 --> 12:15.608
We got more horses coming
into town than we have posts

12:15.641 --> 12:18.678
to tie them to, we can't have that.

12:18.711 --> 12:19.679
Posts?

12:19.712 --> 12:20.914
Posts.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.952
Don't you worry about it, I'm on it.

12:25.985 --> 12:27.220
Reid?

12:29.288 --> 12:31.128
Get your ass down to the
festival and make sure

12:31.156 --> 12:34.760
we have twice as many
posts as we did last year.

12:34.793 --> 12:36.596
Why don't you put Boyd on that?

12:36.629 --> 12:37.897
Why don't you get your
ass down to the festival

12:37.930 --> 12:38.965
and make sure we have twice as many posts

12:38.998 --> 12:40.110
as we did last year?

12:47.740 --> 12:49.308
- Okay.
- Posts.

12:49.341 --> 12:49.908
Good.

12:49.942 --> 12:51.844
Is there anything else?

13:02.154 --> 13:04.624
Well, hey there, Santana.

13:04.657 --> 13:06.892
Long time no see.

13:06.925 --> 13:08.094
Officers.

13:08.127 --> 13:09.729
You been across the border, Santana?

13:09.762 --> 13:10.796
No.

13:10.829 --> 13:11.931
Coming from Dallas.

13:11.964 --> 13:12.966
- Dallas?
- Yeah.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.837
Well, Dallas is north of here

13:17.870 --> 13:20.006
and you're headed north.

13:20.039 --> 13:22.141
You know what I think?

13:22.174 --> 13:26.345
I think our friend here
did come from the border.

13:26.378 --> 13:28.848
He brought back some party favors

13:28.881 --> 13:31.384
that he don't want to
share with his amigos.

13:44.087 --> 13:46.365
Looks like we have a piñata of interest.

13:46.398 --> 13:47.667
Just candy.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.035
Well, I like candy.

13:49.068 --> 13:50.403
Candy is good.

13:54.006 --> 13:55.375
Ho-ho.

13:58.377 --> 14:01.781
Hello, party favors.

14:01.814 --> 14:04.784
Santana,
I'm a victim of disappointment in you.

14:04.817 --> 14:06.285
Come on, guys, give me a break.

14:06.318 --> 14:08.287
The Sheriff knows me.
I've done favors for him.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.089
Believe me, he knows my boss.

14:10.122 --> 14:12.792
I don't know what you're talking about,
Santana.

14:12.825 --> 14:14.360
Where's the money?

14:14.393 --> 14:15.795
I don't have any.

14:15.828 --> 14:17.697
Where's that fucking cash, boy?

14:17.730 --> 14:20.099
John, believe me, I don't have any money.

14:20.132 --> 14:21.400
What'd you call me?

14:21.433 --> 14:23.769
John.

14:23.802 --> 14:25.705
We went to high school together.

14:25.738 --> 14:27.707
Come on, man, give me a break.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.709
I didn't know y'all were such good friends,
Clark.

14:29.742 --> 14:32.411
You disrespectin' me, wetback?

14:32.444 --> 14:33.913
Not at all.

14:33.946 --> 14:36.349
Get the fuck down out of there, boy, now.

14:44.857 --> 14:48.494
I'm gonna teach you some respect, beaner.

14:48.527 --> 14:51.831
Now, what's my name?

14:53.332 --> 14:55.234
Clark.

14:55.267 --> 14:58.471
That's officer Clark, you fucking Mexican.

15:00.072 --> 15:02.041
Come on, guys.

15:02.074 --> 15:03.909
Take the coke, just let me slide.

15:03.942 --> 15:06.212
What do you think, Holtz?

15:06.245 --> 15:09.815
Well, if he gave us the cash, maybe.
But, since he hasn't...

15:09.848 --> 15:12.518
Look, Santana, all we gotta do

15:12.551 --> 15:14.854
is spread a little coke around,

15:14.887 --> 15:16.956
kill your sorry ass,

15:16.989 --> 15:18.324
looks like a drug deal gone bad.

15:18.357 --> 15:19.925
I'm telling you guys, believe me,

15:19.958 --> 15:22.361
I don't have any cash.

15:22.394 --> 15:26.365
Now, boy, I will take
my time busting you up

15:26.398 --> 15:28.067
<i>till I get that money.</i>

15:28.100 --> 15:31.070
<i>Wait a second. Officer Holtz,</i>

15:31.103 --> 15:33.439
Officer Clark... Let's talk this out.

15:33.472 --> 15:35.975
Whoa, whoa. What's he calling
our names out like that for?

15:36.008 --> 15:37.877
Are you wearing a wire, boy?

15:37.910 --> 15:39.011
- Hmm?
- No, no.

15:39.044 --> 15:40.012
You trying to set us up here?

15:40.045 --> 15:41.881
No.

15:41.914 --> 15:43.282
Hi, Selena.

15:44.883 --> 15:47.186
Wait, wait.

15:47.219 --> 15:49.455
Amigo, you just killed your wife.

15:49.488 --> 15:51.257
The money's with her.

15:51.290 --> 15:52.892
No, no, no, no, Officer Clark, please.

15:52.925 --> 15:55.394
Looks like we got ourselves
a double homicide.

15:55.427 --> 15:56.796
Come on, John, please don't do this, man.

15:56.829 --> 15:58.197
26, requesting backup,

15:58.230 --> 16:02.067
<i>just north of marker 51 on the old road.</i>

16:02.100 --> 16:03.656
<i>Apparent drug deal gone bad.</i>

16:05.537 --> 16:07.406
Hannah, was that Holtz?

16:07.439 --> 16:09.108
Yes, Sheriff, it was.

16:09.141 --> 16:10.309
Thank you.

16:10.342 --> 16:11.577
You're welcome.

16:11.610 --> 16:13.913
Gant.

16:13.946 --> 16:14.914
I want you and Stuckey on this.

16:14.947 --> 16:16.215
- Okay.
- Go on, go on.

16:16.248 --> 16:17.917
Reid, back him up.

16:17.950 --> 16:19.018
Copy that.

16:19.051 --> 16:20.586
What's going on?

16:20.619 --> 16:22.321
You can stand down,
I got enough men on this as it is.

16:22.354 --> 16:23.355
Come on, Sheriff, I want in.

16:23.388 --> 16:25.825
No, just stay here. Okay?

16:25.858 --> 16:28.861
In case the phone rings,
answer it, it's important.

16:28.894 --> 16:30.496
Boyd, you're riding with me.

16:30.529 --> 16:32.932
Whoa, bro, okay, okay, okay,
I'm not disrespecting you,

16:32.965 --> 16:34.133
you earned your stripes, I got it.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.401
I got it, I got it.

16:35.434 --> 16:36.936
Just don't do anything, please, man.

16:36.969 --> 16:38.237
You went to high school with her,
you know her.

16:38.270 --> 16:40.539
You said you want us to let you go, boy.

16:40.572 --> 16:42.608
What you doing standing here?

16:42.641 --> 16:45.411
Go.

16:45.444 --> 16:47.246
Santana, get it through your thick head.

16:47.279 --> 16:49.348
If you don't run,
you're gonna die right here

16:49.381 --> 16:50.850
where you stand.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.451
I said go, Mexican.

17:04.563 --> 17:06.999
Well, guess he's a Mexi-can't.

17:12.104 --> 17:13.638
Officers!

17:13.672 --> 17:15.641
This is a police matter, sir.

17:15.674 --> 17:19.011
- For your own safety, continue on your way.
- What's going on?

17:19.044 --> 17:21.012
You shut your mouth,
boy, do as you're told.

17:21.046 --> 17:23.213
Now move on there or I will arrest you.

17:24.983 --> 17:26.886
Son of a bitch.

17:30.088 --> 17:31.390
Damn.

17:31.423 --> 17:34.260
Son of a bitch is out of range.

17:34.293 --> 17:36.738
Looks like he's headed
towards Brown's Lake.

17:38.463 --> 17:40.666
Put the word out.

17:40.699 --> 17:44.103
Dispatch, this is 26,
suspect heading towards

17:44.136 --> 17:46.939
Brown's Lake on foot, armed and dangerous.

17:59.151 --> 18:00.419
26, this is 10.

18:00.452 --> 18:02.221
We are at the other side of the river.

18:02.254 --> 18:04.032
Copy 10, heading your direction.

18:17.269 --> 18:19.272
Hey, I see him over there.

18:25.978 --> 18:27.179
I think I got him.

18:31.350 --> 18:34.020
I think not. Let's go.

18:42.986 --> 18:45.264
Gant, I see him, that's him. That is him!

18:45.297 --> 18:47.199
- Well, let 'em know.
- 26, this is 10.

18:47.232 --> 18:48.734
We have a 20 on your suspect.

18:48.767 --> 18:52.104
He is heading towards Bohemian Hall.

18:52.137 --> 18:53.572
Best part of the job, partner.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.040
Best part of the job.

18:55.073 --> 18:56.275
I'm with you.

18:56.308 --> 18:57.376
Let's get him.

18:59.411 --> 19:01.714
Let's have ourselves some fun, huh?

19:43.055 --> 19:44.256
Santana?

19:46.258 --> 19:47.536
We know you're in here.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.230
Come out, amigo.

19:57.569 --> 19:58.771
Listen...

20:00.572 --> 20:02.517
Reid here has never lost a fight...

20:04.276 --> 20:05.832
and I likes me a good fight.

20:07.679 --> 20:10.282
So if you can come out and kick his ass...

20:11.683 --> 20:16.589
we will let you go... scot-free.

20:18.457 --> 20:20.125
You can trust us.

20:20.158 --> 20:21.460
We're deputies.

20:22.494 --> 20:23.696
If you don't...

20:26.098 --> 20:27.821
we're gonna go to your house...

20:28.667 --> 20:29.802
and kill your wife.

20:42.614 --> 20:43.716
I beat him...

20:45.684 --> 20:47.386
you let me go?

20:47.419 --> 20:49.088
You will walk right out of here.

20:49.121 --> 20:50.389
That's the deal.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.235
Let's see what you got, boy.

21:07.339 --> 21:08.507
Let's get it on!

21:18.917 --> 21:20.862
You'll have to do better than that.

21:34.866 --> 21:36.735
Olé.

21:36.768 --> 21:39.768
That means "you're getting your ass kicked"
in Mexican.

21:41.540 --> 21:43.476
I can handle this. Come on.

21:52.384 --> 21:53.652
Let's go.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.781
Is that all you got?

22:27.619 --> 22:28.821
Now, listen.

22:31.323 --> 22:32.435
What, no fight left?

22:38.730 --> 22:40.299
Still undefeated.

22:50.508 --> 22:51.710
Reid?

23:21.439 --> 23:22.942
That's one dead burrito.

24:23.501 --> 24:24.803
Well...

24:25.837 --> 24:26.972
can I help you?

24:27.005 --> 24:28.407
Yes.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.052
I'd like to file a complaint.

24:31.009 --> 24:34.846
Well, if you'd like to file a complaint,
see Alexa.

24:34.879 --> 24:36.649
Right over there.

24:42.854 --> 24:43.956
Boyd?

24:51.730 --> 24:52.731
Pardon me, ma'am.

24:53.765 --> 24:55.500
My name is Jack Justice.

24:55.533 --> 24:56.835
I want to file a complaint.

24:56.868 --> 24:58.103
What seems to be the trouble?

24:58.136 --> 24:59.705
I saw two police officers

24:59.738 --> 25:01.106
beating up a defenseless man.

25:01.139 --> 25:03.008
You mean they were using excessive force?

25:03.041 --> 25:04.977
They was kicking his ass.

25:09.948 --> 25:11.917
<i>Dispatch, this is 26.</i>

25:11.950 --> 25:14.953
<i>We have a 187 at the north
side of Brown's Lake.</i>

25:17.368 --> 25:19.424
<i>Do we have a possible ID on the body?</i>

25:19.457 --> 25:21.093
<i>Yes, Ray Santana.</i>

25:22.660 --> 25:24.463
Go for Alexa.

25:24.496 --> 25:26.365
<i>I need you to go over to the Santana home</i>

25:26.398 --> 25:28.121
<i>and break the news to his wife.</i>

25:31.469 --> 25:32.470
Copy that.

25:32.504 --> 25:35.674
Pardon me, officer,
can I go on a ride along?

25:35.707 --> 25:36.908
I don't think that's a good idea.

25:36.941 --> 25:38.477
I'm a police officer also.

25:40.412 --> 25:41.513
LAPD.

25:45.817 --> 25:47.262
Hannah, what do you think?

25:49.120 --> 25:50.555
Well, he is an officer,

25:50.588 --> 25:51.890
won't hurt to take him with you.

25:51.923 --> 25:53.625
All right. Come on.

26:10.577 --> 26:12.411
All right, gentlemen, talk to me.

26:12.444 --> 26:13.945
What do we got?

26:13.978 --> 26:16.756
Sheriff,
looks like cause of death's a broken neck.

26:19.551 --> 26:20.919
Yes, it does.

26:20.952 --> 26:23.397
Looks like cause of death
was a broken neck.

26:25.924 --> 26:27.692
Any other possible witnesses?

26:27.725 --> 26:30.781
A big black guy pulled up
asking if he could help but...

26:32.163 --> 26:33.441
we sent him on his way.

26:34.656 --> 26:35.434
Big black guy?

26:35.467 --> 26:37.636
Yes, sir.

26:37.669 --> 26:39.447
This big black guy see anything?

26:40.572 --> 26:42.674
He might have seen Santana bolt.

26:45.009 --> 26:47.579
I see the cocaine.
Is there any money anywhere?

26:47.612 --> 26:49.514
No, that's all we found.

26:49.547 --> 26:50.715
Not one red cent.

26:50.748 --> 26:52.584
Yeah, right.

26:54.752 --> 26:56.121
Boyd, you are a whining,

26:56.154 --> 26:57.756
complaining son of a bitch, aren't you?

26:57.789 --> 26:59.458
Well, sir, I'd be more happy

26:59.491 --> 27:01.693
if we found money instead of cocaine.

27:04.162 --> 27:06.832
He'd be much happier.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.869
Come here, Boyd,
I want to talk to you for a sec.

27:10.902 --> 27:12.104
Come on.

27:15.707 --> 27:16.975
Let me see your gun.

27:21.679 --> 27:23.048
Oh, that's a nice gun.

27:23.081 --> 27:24.049
Yes, sir.

27:24.082 --> 27:25.584
Got a good weight to it.

27:35.226 --> 27:38.763
Hey, Sheriff, what did you do that for?

27:38.796 --> 27:40.499
Because he got on my nerves.

27:41.299 --> 27:42.859
Any you boys have any problem

27:42.867 --> 27:45.604
with the way I handle things around here,
speak up now.

27:45.637 --> 27:47.005
Little warning next time,

27:47.038 --> 27:50.075
I think you might have
blown out my eardrum.

27:50.108 --> 27:51.720
Any other possible witnesses?

27:53.044 --> 27:55.914
- Oh, crap, the phone.
- What about the phone?

27:55.947 --> 27:58.951
Santana was video-talking
with his wife and she saw me.

28:00.618 --> 28:01.854
Let's go.

28:15.934 --> 28:18.570
So what brings you to our small town?

28:18.603 --> 28:19.571
Nothing.

28:19.604 --> 28:21.306
I'm just driving through
on my way to Mexico.

28:21.339 --> 28:22.608
Mexico?

28:23.775 --> 28:25.777
My pops retired there 2 years ago.

28:26.878 --> 28:27.946
Hmm.

28:27.979 --> 28:31.683
So, uh... why Red Mesa?

28:32.784 --> 28:34.319
Hometown girl.

28:34.352 --> 28:37.019
As a matter of fact,
that's my house right there.

28:37.288 --> 28:38.256
Okay.

28:38.289 --> 28:40.258
I never knew how to leave.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.995
Just point your car north and drive.

28:44.095 --> 28:46.565
Some day.

28:46.598 --> 28:49.668
So, um,
what did you do before you were a cop?

28:52.604 --> 28:55.607
I used to make problems disappear.

28:58.009 --> 29:00.078
So what's it like here?

29:00.111 --> 29:02.981
You know, small town,

29:03.014 --> 29:06.251
small town people, small town ideas.

29:06.284 --> 29:07.652
Sounds small.

29:07.685 --> 29:10.188
Hey, are you making fun of me?

29:10.221 --> 29:13.091
Just a little bit.

29:13.124 --> 29:14.726
Before I forget, um,

29:14.759 --> 29:18.096
I have the pass codes to
our social media websites

29:18.129 --> 29:21.099
and there the cops get to write about

29:21.132 --> 29:24.302
what they do and who they are,
and people just love it.

29:24.335 --> 29:26.705
I'm cool, sis, I'm not an officer here.

29:26.738 --> 29:29.741
I know, but you can give
them a big city perspective.

29:30.341 --> 29:32.043
I'm old-school, though, sis.

29:32.076 --> 29:35.380
If I can't put a stamp on it,
I don't send it.

29:35.413 --> 29:37.950
Hey, don't worry, I'll get you up to speed.

29:38.950 --> 29:39.952
I'm cool.

29:44.756 --> 29:46.825
What's wrong?

29:46.858 --> 29:48.636
I'm not looking forward to this.

29:50.274 --> 29:52.330
Are you talking about Santana's wife?

29:52.363 --> 29:53.431
Selena and I,

29:53.464 --> 29:55.934
we used to be really good
friends in high school.

29:55.967 --> 29:57.636
Wow.

29:57.669 --> 29:58.437
You became a cop

29:58.470 --> 30:00.839
and she became a drug dealer's wife?

30:00.872 --> 30:01.974
Yep.

30:04.142 --> 30:05.344
Bad choice.

30:15.787 --> 30:16.821
Who is it?

30:16.854 --> 30:18.690
It's Officer Alexa.

30:51.489 --> 30:53.892
Alexa, who the hell is this?
What's he doing here?

30:53.925 --> 30:55.870
It's okay, Sheriff. He's one of us.

30:58.329 --> 30:59.431
He's one of us?

31:01.633 --> 31:03.702
Don't kid yourself, pretty little thing,

31:03.735 --> 31:05.180
you aren't even one of us.

31:07.805 --> 31:08.840
Is that right?

31:10.007 --> 31:11.409
Are you a po-lice man?

31:11.442 --> 31:12.977
Yes, sir.

31:13.010 --> 31:14.146
Oh.

31:17.849 --> 31:19.818
From the big city, I'm guessing.

31:19.851 --> 31:21.019
That's right, sir.

31:22.954 --> 31:24.289
Ooh.

31:24.322 --> 31:25.357
Ah.

31:26.524 --> 31:27.826
You're all sweaty.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.196
Are you nervous about something, boy?

31:31.229 --> 31:32.731
No, sir.

31:32.764 --> 31:33.765
No, sir?

31:37.470 --> 31:39.304
You just happened to be wandering

31:39.337 --> 31:42.207
through our little town, is that right?

31:42.240 --> 31:43.808
Correct, sir.

31:43.841 --> 31:45.277
I'm correct, sir.

31:46.778 --> 31:48.747
I like you.

31:48.780 --> 31:49.948
I really do.

31:52.283 --> 31:53.485
This the fella?

31:55.386 --> 31:56.988
Yes, it is, Sheriff.

31:58.156 --> 31:59.791
"Yes, it is, Sheriff."

32:00.792 --> 32:03.195
Oh, that's too bad.

32:05.410 --> 32:08.466
Well, don't just stand there,
gentlemen, arrest his ass.

32:08.499 --> 32:10.468
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

32:10.501 --> 32:12.036
- Get out of the way, Alexa.
- He's one of us!

32:12.069 --> 32:13.305
I'm cool.

32:16.874 --> 32:17.876
Stuckey?

32:17.909 --> 32:19.411
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

32:23.114 --> 32:24.783
Fill the void.

32:27.018 --> 32:32.357
A wetback and a nigger are riding in a car.

32:33.324 --> 32:34.359
Who's driving?

32:34.392 --> 32:36.561
I do not know.
Who is driving that car, Stuckey?

32:36.594 --> 32:37.996
A cop.

32:41.098 --> 32:43.902
You should have skipped this part of town,
boy.

32:49.440 --> 32:53.311
One day, one day real soon,

32:53.344 --> 32:56.214
me and you gonna have
a serious conversation.

32:57.448 --> 32:58.950
I'll look forward to it.

33:00.284 --> 33:01.453
Let's go, Shrek.

33:12.363 --> 33:13.431
Lock him up.

33:21.639 --> 33:25.243
Sheriff Payden's personal favorite.

33:25.276 --> 33:29.347
Now if the Flintstones
were an old black family,

33:29.380 --> 33:32.884
what would they be called, huh?

33:34.552 --> 33:36.188
The niggers.

33:39.991 --> 33:42.260
I need to talk to our guest.

33:42.293 --> 33:44.028
Sheriff

33:44.061 --> 33:45.029
Be careful,
don't get too close to that cell.

33:45.062 --> 33:46.230
This isn't the pound,
he's not gonna bite me.

33:46.263 --> 33:49.100
I don't know,
he looks like a junkyard dog to me.

33:52.203 --> 33:57.175
Mr. Justice,
I find myself in the embarrassing position

33:57.208 --> 34:00.245
of having to find a scapegoat.

34:00.278 --> 34:02.547
See,
I have two murders I have to account for.

34:02.580 --> 34:04.048
Oh, yeah.

34:04.081 --> 34:06.284
So I'm the man of the hour, huh?

34:06.317 --> 34:07.452
Oh, no, no, no.

34:07.485 --> 34:09.554
You are the man of the year.

34:09.587 --> 34:12.032
Do you know how I know
it is that I'm loved?

34:12.422 --> 34:14.090
You should have died at birth?

34:18.029 --> 34:19.563
I realize that...

34:19.597 --> 34:21.466
perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot,

34:21.498 --> 34:27.005
my men using the N-word out there

34:27.038 --> 34:28.315
and just now the nnn...

34:29.340 --> 34:31.376
I can't even get myself to say it.

34:31.409 --> 34:33.110
It's a bad word.

34:33.143 --> 34:36.614
But I assure you that
neither myself nor my men

34:36.647 --> 34:40.184
ever want to have to stoop so low

34:40.217 --> 34:42.420
as to intentionally have to call

34:42.453 --> 34:45.156
any black man, woman or child...

34:47.358 --> 34:48.460
neighbor.

34:51.629 --> 34:53.965
Neighbor.

34:58.092 --> 34:59.537
Oh, come on, that's funny.

34:59.570 --> 35:00.538
You know what, Sheriff?

35:00.571 --> 35:01.506
What is it?

35:01.539 --> 35:04.208
You and your racist
redneck band of deputies

35:04.241 --> 35:06.144
are about to get a little of my justice.

35:06.177 --> 35:08.446
And believe me, you're not gonna like it.

35:08.479 --> 35:10.348
Nah, I just don't think
that that's gonna happen.

35:10.381 --> 35:13.151
It's a good idea, but see,
later on this afternoon,

35:13.184 --> 35:16.454
you are going to be shot and
you are going to be killed

35:16.487 --> 35:19.123
because you're gonna be trying to escape.

35:19.156 --> 35:21.225
- You know what, Sheriff?
- Hmm?

35:21.258 --> 35:23.661
Your problem is you think
you've got Flipper in here.

35:23.694 --> 35:26.598
Well, motherfucker, say hello to Jaws.

35:28.699 --> 35:30.068
Oh?

35:32.003 --> 35:33.605
Well, Jaws is goin' down.

35:35.907 --> 35:37.475
Just when you thought it was safe

35:37.508 --> 35:39.610
to get back in the jail cell.

35:39.643 --> 35:42.347
<i>"Jaws".</i>

35:50.788 --> 35:52.223
I'll ask.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.660
Excuse me, Mayor?

35:55.693 --> 35:57.228
The papers would like an exclusive

35:57.261 --> 35:58.496
regarding Officer Justice.

35:58.529 --> 36:00.365
Well, how did they get that so fast?

36:00.398 --> 36:01.565
From the police blog.

36:03.234 --> 36:05.514
Well,
call that girl there and tell her to stop.

36:05.536 --> 36:07.672
We've been flooded with
calls all day wanting to know

36:07.705 --> 36:10.008
just how dangerous Officer Justice is.

36:10.041 --> 36:13.277
You know what? Just refer all
of my calls to Sheriff Payden.

36:13.310 --> 36:14.346
Yes, sir.

36:30.461 --> 36:31.529
Yeah.

36:32.663 --> 36:34.399
I hid the money.

36:37.268 --> 36:39.268
I can't believe they killed Santana.

36:47.812 --> 36:49.747
<i>- Okay.
- This just in.</i>

36:49.780 --> 36:52.617
<i>- Thank you, big brother.
- Sheriff Payden of Red Mesa PD</i>

36:52.650 --> 36:55.753
<i>says they've apprehended

36:55.786 --> 36:58.122
<i>of police officer Carter Boyd</i>

36:58.155 --> 37:01.259
<i>and alleged drug dealer, Ray Santana.</i>

37:01.292 --> 37:03.828
<i>The suspect is troubled
officer Jack Justice</i>

37:03.861 --> 37:05.630
<i>of the Los Angeles PD,</i>

37:05.663 --> 37:07.665

37:14.405 --> 37:17.275
<i>Justice killed the robbery suspects.</i>

37:17.308 --> 37:20.344
<i>It is also reported that
Justice had left a manifesto</i>

37:20.377 --> 37:23.681
<i>on the Mesa PD website
confessing to the murders,</i>

37:23.714 --> 37:26.184
<i>vowing he would never be taken alive</i>

37:26.217 --> 37:27.652
<i>and that he would take revenge</i>

37:27.685 --> 37:29.821
<i>on those officers who have wronged him.</i>

37:29.854 --> 37:34.125
<i>Stay tuned, we will have more
information as it unfolds.</i>

37:44.135 --> 37:47.472
<i>411, how may I direct your call?</i>

37:47.505 --> 37:50.875
<i>- Get me the Mayor.
- One moment, please.</i>

37:50.908 --> 37:53.075
Let's go. We're taking you out of here.

37:54.912 --> 37:56.314
Come on!

37:56.347 --> 37:57.315
Oh, look at that.

37:57.348 --> 38:02.120
He's put on his pretty little hoodie, huh?
Yeah.

38:02.153 --> 38:04.542
No, baby, I swear she didn't mean anything.

38:05.336 --> 38:07.225
You must think I'm a real bad man.

38:07.258 --> 38:08.593
<i>Yeah, not really, boy.</i>

38:08.626 --> 38:10.728
We don't need that, put that away.

38:10.761 --> 38:12.797
Move, nigger.

38:32.950 --> 38:34.252
Everybody get down!

38:59.610 --> 39:01.245
Go for Payden.

40:07.678 --> 40:11.649
Alexa, please don't shoot me.

40:11.682 --> 40:13.651
Damn it, Jack, you're under arrest.

40:13.684 --> 40:14.752
Don't move.

40:14.785 --> 40:17.521
I don't want to kill you,
but I will if I have to.

40:17.554 --> 40:21.292
I won't leave this chair if
you just put the gun down.

40:32.069 --> 40:35.940
I just need you to think
why I came to your house.

40:35.973 --> 40:37.308
Why are you here?

40:37.341 --> 40:39.443
Outside of the Boy Scouts,

40:39.476 --> 40:42.546
you're the most honest person here.

40:42.579 --> 40:45.383
Red Mesa is a corrupt police department,
sis,

40:45.416 --> 40:46.984
and you know.

40:47.017 --> 40:50.017
Why do you think they never
let you on police business?

40:51.357 --> 40:53.691
They don't want me to see what's going on.

40:53.724 --> 40:55.893
Red Mesa Police Department

40:55.926 --> 40:58.815
is the most corrupt police
department I've ever seen.

41:01.332 --> 41:02.867
It's true.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.435
But what about Boyd?

41:06.637 --> 41:08.506
Who's Boyd?

41:08.539 --> 41:10.007
Well, what about all the damage

41:10.040 --> 41:12.576
and all the people you
hurt back at the station?

41:12.609 --> 41:14.979
I did hurt a lot of people
at that police station,

41:15.012 --> 41:17.415
but I didn't kill nobody.

41:17.448 --> 41:21.052
And believe me, little sis,
I'm good at killing.

41:34.665 --> 41:35.967
Clear it and call it.

41:41.372 --> 41:45.409
You know, I need you to put
all this together right now

41:45.442 --> 41:47.812
'cause I don't have a lot of time left.

41:47.845 --> 41:50.047
I'm gonna need your help.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.750
I'm gonna need to take your unmarked unit.

42:13.504 --> 42:14.972
<i>¿Dónde estáel dinero?</i>

42:17.007 --> 42:19.410
<i>Por fa-fucking-vor.</i>

42:52.142 --> 42:54.645
Yeah?

42:54.678 --> 42:57.548
I need to call in that one favor.

42:59.750 --> 43:00.852
Where are you?

43:19.670 --> 43:21.572
<i>You know what, Sheriff?</i>

43:21.605 --> 43:22.606
You're gonna spend

43:22.640 --> 43:25.543
the rest of your life in prison,
Sheriff Payden.

43:27.177 --> 43:30.114
Oh, is that a fact?

43:30.147 --> 43:31.649
Well, I tell you what, boy,

43:31.682 --> 43:32.716
I don't think that's gonna happen

43:32.749 --> 43:34.084
because I have something out here

43:34.117 --> 43:36.587
that you want really, really bad.

43:39.022 --> 43:40.224
Little chica

43:40.257 --> 43:42.893
<i>named Selena. Listen...</i>

43:42.926 --> 43:46.063
Help me, please! I didn't do anything!

43:46.096 --> 43:49.800
"Help me, please! I didn't do anything!"

43:49.833 --> 43:51.101
You gonna let this young lady die out here,

43:51.134 --> 43:53.471
or are you gonna be a
hero and come get her?

43:53.504 --> 43:55.739
If you touch that girl...

43:55.772 --> 43:58.142
Oh, no, I don't think so.

43:58.175 --> 44:00.478
Anyway,
I'm not gonna get to kill this little girl

44:00.511 --> 44:01.679
because you're gonna come out here

44:01.712 --> 44:03.815
and save her, aren't you, hero?

44:04.915 --> 44:06.550
<i>You know, Sheriff?</i>

44:06.583 --> 44:09.587
You're one stupid man.

44:12.222 --> 44:14.625
Afraid that's a matter of opinion, Jack.

44:14.658 --> 44:16.827
What's it gonna be? You gonna come
out here, you gonna save the girl?

44:16.860 --> 44:20.694
Or am I gonna turn her over to my
boys to have something to play with?

44:21.131 --> 44:22.533
Yeah, I'm coming.

44:24.535 --> 44:26.037
But I'm coming for you.

44:27.070 --> 44:28.473
He's coming for me.

44:30.140 --> 44:31.509
Bring it on!

44:51.028 --> 44:52.530
Magnum!

44:53.830 --> 44:55.066
Hey, come here, boy.

45:08.178 --> 45:09.747
Clark.

45:09.780 --> 45:11.082
Finally awake.

45:12.182 --> 45:13.849
What the fuck you hit me with?

45:15.752 --> 45:17.188
It was on your porch.

45:20.791 --> 45:23.661
You have no idea who you're messing with.

45:23.694 --> 45:25.229
Yeah?

45:25.262 --> 45:27.765
I've been told that before.

45:27.798 --> 45:29.567
It just didn't work out.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.600
The best thing you can do is
just clear on out of here.

45:35.005 --> 45:36.674
Yeah.

45:36.707 --> 45:38.676
Let's talk about...

45:38.709 --> 45:41.045
how you're gonna die.

45:41.078 --> 45:42.613
Die?

45:43.313 --> 45:45.316
Son, I'm an officer of the law.

45:47.574 --> 45:48.852
You don't cut me loose,

45:48.885 --> 45:51.188
I will tear your ass inside out.

45:52.356 --> 45:55.159
Man, I'm not a man for blood and guts,

45:55.192 --> 45:59.063
but I did grow up in Compton.
But you know what?

46:00.931 --> 46:02.931
I'm gonna make an exception for you.

46:03.900 --> 46:05.636
The hell you runnin' on about?

46:07.337 --> 46:09.940
I want to know where that girl is.

46:09.973 --> 46:12.209
Selena?

46:12.242 --> 46:16.080
I ain't ever known no darkie
give two shakes about a beaner.

46:16.113 --> 46:18.315
What's she to you?

46:18.348 --> 46:20.885
She'll take me right to the Sheriff.

46:25.756 --> 46:29.126
Damn, boy,
you got to be about as dumb as you is ugly.

46:29.159 --> 46:31.662
Well,
I sure as shit ain't gonna tell you now.

46:32.963 --> 46:33.931
Okay.

46:33.964 --> 46:35.633
Have it your way.

46:43.073 --> 46:44.875
Oh, motherfucker.

46:44.908 --> 46:46.277
You bleed a lot.

46:49.279 --> 46:50.391
That ain't so bad...

46:51.381 --> 46:53.183
shoot 'em all off.

46:53.216 --> 46:55.219
Okay.

46:59.156 --> 47:02.226
You cocksucker, I swear to Christ

47:02.259 --> 47:03.761
I will never tell you where that...

47:03.794 --> 47:05.929
Where that fucking bitch is now.

47:05.962 --> 47:07.665
You know what, Clark?

47:07.698 --> 47:09.254
I'm starting to believe you.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.402
So I'm gonna take off

47:11.435 --> 47:13.491
'cause I'm running out of patience...

47:14.371 --> 47:16.260
and you're running out of fingers.

47:18.008 --> 47:19.309
Hey.

47:19.342 --> 47:20.411
What do you need?

47:20.444 --> 47:21.779
Let me have a smoke.

47:23.213 --> 47:24.215
Okay.

47:33.256 --> 47:34.959
You know what, Clark?

47:35.826 --> 47:38.295
You shouldn't smoke these things.

47:38.328 --> 47:40.331
'Cause these...

47:41.898 --> 47:43.398
are gonna kill you one day.

49:40.851 --> 49:42.286
Afternoon, gentlemen.

49:42.319 --> 49:43.287
Good afternoon.

49:43.320 --> 49:46.023
Nice day for a rodeo.

49:46.056 --> 49:47.191
I'm Agent Cobb.

49:47.224 --> 49:48.525
This is Agent Lobo.

49:48.558 --> 49:49.960
I'm Mayor Dorsey.

49:49.993 --> 49:52.129
Perhaps you're familiar
with the Dorsey name.

49:52.162 --> 49:53.497
My great-granddaddy fought alongside

49:53.530 --> 49:55.030
Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

49:57.568 --> 49:59.336
What brings you boys here to Red Mesa?

49:59.369 --> 50:00.838
It's not about that murder business, right?

50:00.871 --> 50:02.539
Hey, hey, hey.

50:02.572 --> 50:04.141
That's my business, all right?

50:04.174 --> 50:05.242
I'll take care of it.

50:05.275 --> 50:06.410
Well, actually, Mayor,

50:06.443 --> 50:09.388
it does have something to
do with the murder business.

50:10.580 --> 50:12.283
Do you have a suspect yet?

50:13.583 --> 50:14.852
Yeah.

50:14.885 --> 50:16.453
I do.

50:16.486 --> 50:18.489
Does he have a name?

50:19.289 --> 50:21.158
Yes.

50:21.191 --> 50:22.593
He does.

50:24.494 --> 50:26.063
What is it?

50:29.145 --> 50:30.534
His name is Jack Justice.

50:30.567 --> 50:32.970
He's a crazy cop out of Los Angeles,

50:33.003 --> 50:35.873
has a habit of breaking people's necks

50:35.906 --> 50:36.940
and then shooting them.

50:36.973 --> 50:38.175
Bad habit.

50:38.208 --> 50:40.043
And you think he's still in town?

50:40.076 --> 50:41.111
I know he's still in town

50:41.144 --> 50:42.613
'cause he's one mean son of a bitch.

50:42.646 --> 50:44.581
But let me make something
very clear to you:

50:44.614 --> 50:47.384
<i>he is my mean son of a bitch.</i>

50:47.417 --> 50:49.086
Sheriff, I'd like to go to the station

50:49.119 --> 50:50.387
and review your evidence.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.256
You go to the station,
get yourself a cup of coffee,

50:52.289 --> 50:54.491
get yourself a mint julep.

50:54.524 --> 50:57.928
As far as the evidence goes,
I'll see what I can do.

51:00.230 --> 51:02.132
Thank you, gentlemen.

51:06.536 --> 51:08.105
He's gonna be trouble.

51:08.138 --> 51:10.407
He's not gonna be trouble.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.109
I'll drop you off at the station,

51:12.142 --> 51:13.610
you see what you can find out.

51:13.643 --> 51:15.112
All right.

51:21.118 --> 51:22.519
Mayor, if you ever mention

51:22.553 --> 51:24.621
my business to anyone
outside of my department,

51:24.654 --> 51:27.458
so help me God, I will poison your dog.

51:35.732 --> 51:36.934
Hello.

51:36.967 --> 51:38.135
Hello. How can I help you?

51:38.168 --> 51:40.537
I'm Agent Lobo.

51:40.570 --> 51:42.210
It's okay, Hannah. I'll take it from here.

51:42.238 --> 51:44.074
- Okay, Alexa.
- Follow me please.

51:50.548 --> 51:51.548
I'm Officer Alexa.

51:51.581 --> 51:53.250
Lobo. Agent Lobo.

51:53.283 --> 51:55.052
What exactly do you do?

51:55.085 --> 51:57.154
I clean up messy situations.

51:57.187 --> 51:58.387
Do you have jurisdiction here?

51:58.388 --> 51:59.656
I can go anywhere.

51:59.689 --> 52:01.392
Well, you got your hands full.

52:02.759 --> 52:05.128
Tell me what you think you know.

52:05.161 --> 52:06.730
I believe that Justice is innocent,

52:06.763 --> 52:09.466
Santana was killed in a drug takedown,

52:09.499 --> 52:12.002
and somehow Boyd just got
killed in the process.

52:12.035 --> 52:13.403
Who's involved in the drug heist?

52:13.436 --> 52:16.273
Everyone at the station
except for Hannah and myself.

52:16.306 --> 52:17.341
Names.

52:17.374 --> 52:18.475
Give me names.

52:18.508 --> 52:21.078
Gant, Stuckey,

52:21.111 --> 52:23.246
Clark, McCain and Reid.

52:23.279 --> 52:26.249
So why don't you think
this Justice is the guy?

52:26.282 --> 52:28.585
All the media is reporting
that he posted a manifesto

52:28.618 --> 52:30.520
on the social media website.

52:30.553 --> 52:31.721
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

52:31.754 --> 52:34.458
And he couldn't have because
he doesn't have the password.

52:34.491 --> 52:35.993
To post the manifesto?

52:36.026 --> 52:37.094
Exactly.

52:37.127 --> 52:38.628
And how do you know this?

52:38.661 --> 52:41.565
'Cause I'm the one that
gives out the password.

52:41.598 --> 52:43.266
Sorry to hear that, Alexa.

52:43.299 --> 52:44.301
Your weapon.

52:49.539 --> 52:51.041
We're going for a ride.

52:51.074 --> 52:53.276
You try to be a hero, you die.

52:53.309 --> 52:54.511
Let's go.

52:58.581 --> 53:00.717
<i>Sheriff Payden, this is Hannah,</i>

53:00.750 --> 53:02.719
<i>come back.</i>

53:02.752 --> 53:04.688
Go for Payden.

53:04.721 --> 53:07.524
<i>Sheriff,
we just got a call from Holly Brown.</i>

53:07.557 --> 53:10.727
<i>She's said that Clark's house blew up.</i>

53:10.760 --> 53:14.331
Anybody say whether Clark
is still alive or not?

53:14.364 --> 53:15.766
<i>It's not looking good.</i>

53:15.799 --> 53:18.302
<i>There's a burned body tied to a radiator.</i>

53:20.871 --> 53:23.106
I want you to patch me
through to Jim Thorpe,

53:23.139 --> 53:24.541
he needs to get his airplane up in the sky.

53:24.574 --> 53:26.543
And, uh, who has a helicopter?

53:26.576 --> 53:27.778
Hmm...

53:27.811 --> 53:30.147
Bill Cherry, get Bill Cherry on the horn,

53:30.180 --> 53:31.448
tell him I want him to go up there,

53:31.481 --> 53:33.050
see if they can't find this Justice

53:33.083 --> 53:34.451
son of a bitch pronto.

53:34.484 --> 53:37.054
<i>Roger that, Sheriff.</i>

53:37.087 --> 53:38.055
Stuckey, Payden.

53:38.088 --> 53:39.423
You got your ears on?

53:39.456 --> 53:41.158
<i>Go for Stuckey.</i>

53:41.191 --> 53:43.226
Stuckey,
I need you to haul ass over to Clark's,

53:43.259 --> 53:44.828
apparently he's on fire.

53:44.861 --> 53:49.266
<i>Roger that, Sheriff. Shall we put him out?</i>

53:49.299 --> 53:52.135
No,
you should go over there and make s'mores.

53:52.168 --> 53:54.571
Yes, you should put him out, you idiot.

53:56.606 --> 53:58.709
I'm in a cesspool of idiots.

54:18.661 --> 54:20.197
You're part of this, too?

54:20.230 --> 54:21.665
What's wrong with you people?

54:21.698 --> 54:23.500
You know what your problem is, Alexa?

54:23.533 --> 54:25.202
You still believe in the tooth fairy.

54:25.235 --> 54:26.503
You know what your problem is?

54:26.536 --> 54:28.638
You believe crime pays.

54:28.671 --> 54:30.640
It pays more than this fucking badge.

54:30.673 --> 54:32.409
Alexa!

54:32.442 --> 54:33.444
Selena!

54:57.500 --> 54:59.169
Uh-oh.

55:03.573 --> 55:04.675
That's gotta hurt.

55:26.496 --> 55:28.431
I can't believe it.

55:28.464 --> 55:30.367
Oh, man.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.902
Alright that's brutal.

55:33.903 --> 55:36.573
Tied him to the radiator,

55:36.606 --> 55:38.742
couldn't even get away.

55:39.876 --> 55:42.279
I've known him my whole life.

55:45.582 --> 55:48.285
Thorpe is in the air.

55:48.318 --> 55:50.387
Come on, Holtz, we'll get the SOB,

55:50.420 --> 55:51.698
Alright, we'll get him.

56:01.710 --> 56:03.266
What the hell happened here?

56:03.299 --> 56:05.502
What's it look like? The house burned down.

56:05.535 --> 56:06.803
You guys can handle this,
we're gonna go meet up

56:06.836 --> 56:07.871
with the Sheriff.

56:07.904 --> 56:09.206
All right.

56:46.909 --> 56:48.245
<i>It's Lobo.</i>

56:48.278 --> 56:49.446
<i>I'm a little busy at the moment.</i>

56:49.479 --> 56:50.547
<i>Leave a message.</i>

56:50.580 --> 56:52.649
Call me. I'm at the hotel.

56:59.756 --> 57:02.559
I can't believe he blew him up.

57:02.592 --> 57:04.361
Holtz,

57:04.394 --> 57:06.496
I got one for you.

57:06.529 --> 57:07.831
Yeah.

57:07.864 --> 57:11.534
Hey, why do decent white folk shop

57:11.567 --> 57:14.638
at nigger yard sales, huh?

57:14.671 --> 57:16.473
Huh?

57:16.506 --> 57:18.508
To get their belongings back.

57:20.476 --> 57:22.879
Welcome, all shoppers.

57:22.912 --> 57:25.916
We got a special on rednecks today.

57:27.917 --> 57:29.620
Now just drive.

57:47.337 --> 57:49.439
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

57:50.940 --> 57:52.309
Hey!

57:53.743 --> 57:55.966
What the hell are you doing at my house?

58:00.374 --> 58:02.819
I stopped by the station,
you weren't there.

58:02.852 --> 58:04.054
And that somehow gives you the right

58:04.087 --> 58:05.976
to walk through my gate uninvited?

58:09.959 --> 58:11.762
You have any news for me?

58:13.363 --> 58:15.532
Do I have any news for you?

58:15.565 --> 58:17.067
Yeah, I got some news for you.

58:17.100 --> 58:18.260
The son of a bitch burned down

58:18.268 --> 58:21.938
one of my officer's homes
with my officer still in it.

58:21.971 --> 58:24.474
Said officer is dead.

58:26.142 --> 58:27.978
So then he's still in town?

58:29.379 --> 58:30.980
Yes.

58:31.013 --> 58:32.749
I told you he's still in
town and I'm gonna find him.

58:32.782 --> 58:34.050
I certainly don't need any chickenshit

58:34.083 --> 58:36.453
federal man interfering with my business.

58:36.486 --> 58:37.988
That would be you.

58:39.689 --> 58:42.859
Let me ask you something, Sheriff.

58:42.892 --> 58:44.828
Why do you think that this man

58:44.861 --> 58:46.830
just comes into your town

58:46.863 --> 58:49.499
and starts killing people like this?

58:50.967 --> 58:52.703
Are you questioning me?

58:53.569 --> 58:56.673
Are you questioning my
authority in my town?

58:57.942 --> 58:59.109
I think he's doing it

58:59.142 --> 59:02.912
because he's one crazy son of a bitch,
that's why.

59:02.945 --> 59:05.515
Well, then we better find him.

59:25.601 --> 59:26.636
Where's the girl?

59:28.137 --> 59:31.975
What, you're gonna kill me?

59:32.008 --> 59:33.676
What...

59:33.709 --> 59:35.011
What do you think Sheriff's gonna do to me

59:35.044 --> 59:37.814
if I tell you where she is?

59:37.847 --> 59:41.017
I hope she's dead anyway!

59:41.050 --> 59:42.552
Okay.

01:00:08.578 --> 01:00:09.746
Hey!

01:00:09.779 --> 01:00:11.147
Stop!

01:00:16.586 --> 01:00:18.922
Hey... stop!

01:00:29.665 --> 01:00:30.934
No!

01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:32.469
Holtz!

01:00:32.502 --> 01:00:33.503
Holtz!

01:00:40.243 --> 01:00:41.478
Holtz!

01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.813
No!

01:00:49.698 --> 01:00:51.754
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:00:51.787 --> 01:00:52.922
No, she's in a barn,

01:00:52.955 --> 01:00:54.257
she's in the barn!

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.559
On Old Camp Road at the Davies' barn!

01:00:56.592 --> 01:00:58.695
Please don't kill me, I told you...

01:00:58.728 --> 01:01:00.096
I got a joke for you.

01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:02.265
What is Barney Rubble's son's name?

01:01:02.298 --> 01:01:04.567
Please, please, I don't want to die...

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.702
His name ain't please-I-don't-want-to-die,

01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:06.703
tell me his name.

01:01:06.736 --> 01:01:07.871
Please don't kill me!

01:01:07.904 --> 01:01:09.105
I don't want to die,

01:01:09.138 --> 01:01:10.540
I don't...

01:01:13.009 --> 01:01:15.011
Bam-Bam.

01:02:03.759 --> 01:02:04.727
<i>It's Lobo.</i>

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.872
<i>I'm a little busy...</i>

01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:47.063
Excuse me, ladies.

01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:49.766
It's okay, mister.

01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:52.068
Are you the judge in the beauty contest?

01:03:52.101 --> 01:03:53.069
No, I'm not, dear,

01:03:53.102 --> 01:03:55.838
but, uh... if I was,

01:03:55.871 --> 01:03:56.739
I'd vote for you

01:03:56.772 --> 01:03:59.175
and you two girls would win, I think.

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:00.410
Come on, girls. Let's go.

01:04:00.443 --> 01:04:01.878
- Bye.
- Bye!

01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:18.394
It's good to see you, Cody.

01:04:18.427 --> 01:04:21.431
Sorry for seeing you in
these crazy circumstances.

01:04:23.733 --> 01:04:25.135
Let's get out of here.

01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:34.244
You know this is not gonna end well.

01:04:36.145 --> 01:04:37.714
Yeah, I know that.

01:04:39.348 --> 01:04:42.919
Why don't you just let it go
and get the hell out of here?

01:04:45.254 --> 01:04:47.757
You know I can't do that.

01:04:52.228 --> 01:04:53.229
Look,

01:04:54.387 --> 01:04:55.832
I don't know what happened

01:04:55.865 --> 01:04:57.734
and I really don't care.

01:04:59.368 --> 01:05:01.071
I owe you.

01:05:06.942 --> 01:05:09.179
I think I'm paid in full.

01:05:12.148 --> 01:05:13.916
Hmm.

01:05:13.949 --> 01:05:15.285
We good?

01:05:16.552 --> 01:05:18.354
Yeah.

01:05:18.387 --> 01:05:20.256
We're way good.

01:05:22.391 --> 01:05:24.360
You watch your ass, huh?

01:05:24.393 --> 01:05:25.495
You got it.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.970
The Sheriff better sleep
with his lights on.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:53.289
Whoo!

01:05:56.992 --> 01:05:58.294
How about another kiss?

01:05:58.327 --> 01:05:59.362
Hey.

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:01.497
Cool it, Randall.

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:04.134
Let's wait for the chief.

01:06:05.534 --> 01:06:07.303
Hey.

01:06:09.605 --> 01:06:10.907
I'm game.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.075
Hey, shut him up.

01:06:13.108 --> 01:06:14.944
Watch this.

01:06:31.327 --> 01:06:32.562
Kick his ass!

01:06:36.899 --> 01:06:38.501
Kick his fuckin' ass!

01:06:58.153 --> 01:06:59.956
All right.

01:06:59.989 --> 01:07:01.457
Yeah.

01:07:59.348 --> 01:08:01.126
See something you like, cupcake?

01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:04.553
Uncuff me and let me kick your ass.

01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:06.355
Oh, really?

01:08:06.388 --> 01:08:08.190
She thinks she's gonna
whoop your ass, Gant.

01:08:08.223 --> 01:08:10.260
I always knew Latinas were fiery.

01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:13.496
Let's see what you got.

01:08:18.167 --> 01:08:19.335
Come on.

01:08:19.368 --> 01:08:21.470
Oh, that's so cute.

01:08:23.272 --> 01:08:25.041
Oh, that's cute.

01:08:25.073 --> 01:08:26.341
She ain't playin'.

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:30.979
I do believe that's the most action

01:08:31.013 --> 01:08:33.402
you've seen in years without paying for it.

01:08:36.484 --> 01:08:39.988
Oh, hey she's really choking you, bro.

01:08:40.022 --> 01:08:42.358
Yeah she's choking you out!

01:08:46.495 --> 01:08:48.163
She ain't playin'.

01:08:52.067 --> 01:08:53.102
Alexa.

01:08:54.303 --> 01:08:56.171
Stop, you'll kill her!

01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:07.483
McCain?

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.999
Let's go check this out.

01:10:23.759 --> 01:10:25.695
If you're gonna hit me, hit me.

01:10:44.713 --> 01:10:46.649
Hey, Gant,

01:10:46.682 --> 01:10:50.119
what about having a
little conversation now?

01:10:54.423 --> 01:10:56.092
Let's talk.

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:04.220
Hey, Justice, don't forget about me.

01:13:04.253 --> 01:13:05.221
Lobo,

01:13:05.254 --> 01:13:06.656
better catch up.

01:13:38.053 --> 01:13:39.255
Stop!

01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:42.892
No more killing.

01:13:54.703 --> 01:13:56.305
Be still.

01:14:36.845 --> 01:14:38.547
Oh, shit.

01:14:40.349 --> 01:14:41.550
No...

01:14:42.818 --> 01:14:44.820
No!

01:15:24.059 --> 01:15:25.061
Where did he go?

01:15:35.504 --> 01:15:36.906
You okay?

01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:39.475
I think so.

01:15:40.675 --> 01:15:42.511
We're okay. We'll be all right.

01:15:44.179 --> 01:15:47.116
Ladies, it was a pleasure.

01:16:49.644 --> 01:16:52.089
How many bodies were
recovered at the scene?

01:16:52.848 --> 01:16:53.849
I don't know,

01:16:53.882 --> 01:16:55.484
a lot.

01:16:55.517 --> 01:16:58.295
Well, was Jack Justice one
of the bodies recovered?

01:16:59.379 --> 01:17:01.824
Mayor, what about the
drugs that were found?

01:17:01.857 --> 01:17:03.926
I don't know anything about that.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.861
This is a black eye for Red Mesa.

01:17:07.262 --> 01:17:08.764
Mayor, a black eye?

01:17:08.797 --> 01:17:11.066
We got 12 dead bodies.

01:17:11.099 --> 01:17:12.868
I just don't know anything.

01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:13.869
Excuse me.

01:17:13.902 --> 01:17:15.237
Yes. Can I help you?

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:18.140
I wanted to know how Agent Lobo was doing.

01:17:18.173 --> 01:17:20.075
Lobo?

01:17:20.108 --> 01:17:21.777
You mean as in "wolf"?

01:17:22.811 --> 01:17:24.880
Yeah. Is he okay?

01:17:24.913 --> 01:17:27.182
Ma'am, I don't know an Agent Lobo.

01:17:27.215 --> 01:17:30.052
Sure you do, he's partners with Agent Cobb.

01:17:30.085 --> 01:17:33.589
Ma'am, I can assure you
there's no Agent Cobb or Lobo

01:17:33.622 --> 01:17:35.624
that's working on this case.

01:17:38.727 --> 01:17:40.262

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.101
