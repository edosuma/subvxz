07:25.904 --> 07:28.698
Yeah, someone

07:25.904 --> 07:28.698
to compliment you.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.117
Why? I compliment myself

07:28.740 --> 07:30.117
all the time.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.286
Watch this, good show.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.286
Nice work, Danny.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.538
Tanner, I-I'm sure you're gonna

07:32.327 --> 07:35.538
really like Vicky Larson.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.457
She's starting tomorrow.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.457
Oh, Vicky.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.376
She's starting tomorrow?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.585
Hi.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.588
Tomorrow works for me.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.506
Hi, there, I'm, uh,

07:43.630 --> 07:45.506
I'm Danny Tanner.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.841
Welcome to my world.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.176
Oh, It's nice

07:46.883 --> 07:48.176
to meet you, Danny.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.804
Alright, you two,

07:48.218 --> 07:50.804
so talk, mingle

07:50.845 --> 07:52.431
make chemistry.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.518
So, have you ever done

07:53.890 --> 07:57.518
a morning talk show before?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.354
Well, no, but that

07:57.560 --> 07:59.354
doesn't mean that I haven't--

07:59.396 --> 08:01.648
Well, don't you worry

07:59.396 --> 08:01.648
about a thing.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.401
I am gonna teach you

08:01.689 --> 08:04.401
everything I know.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.279
For instance, words

08:04.443 --> 08:07.279
like, uh, "Speaking of"

08:07.321 --> 08:10.324
can smoothly get you

08:07.321 --> 08:10.324
from one subject to another.

08:10.365 --> 08:14.161
That's what we people in

08:10.365 --> 08:14.161
talk-show biz call a segue.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.787
Segue, I think I got it.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.705
Ah, Vicky,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.705
they want you in wardrobe.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.291
Ah, I guess

08:17.747 --> 08:19.291
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.959
Oh! "I'll see you tomorrow."

08:21.001 --> 08:22.794
Now, that's an excellent way

08:21.001 --> 08:22.794
to end the show up.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.212
Boy, you're catching on already.

08:29.968 --> 08:30.927
There.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.137
Doesn't that feel much better

08:32.179 --> 08:34.139
without those

08:32.179 --> 08:34.139
hospital bracelets?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.432
You're allowed

08:34.181 --> 08:35.432
to take 'em off?

08:35.474 --> 08:36.516
Yeah, well, it's not like

08:36.557 --> 08:38.226
they're mattress tags.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.146
Well, how do you

08:39.560 --> 08:41.146
tell 'em apart?

08:41.188 --> 08:44.732
Oh, it's easy, Nicky's in

08:41.188 --> 08:44.732
the mint-green booties, yes.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.777
And Alex is in the peach ones.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.777
Hi, sweetie.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.113
Listen, will you girls do me

08:47.819 --> 08:50.113
a favor and entertain the boys

08:50.155 --> 08:52.615
while I put these hospital

08:50.155 --> 08:52.615
bracelets in their baby books?

08:52.657 --> 08:53.825
Sure.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.076
Now, don't you guys dare do

08:55.118 --> 08:58.579
anything cute while I'm gone.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.579
Okay?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.166
Okay, let's play with them.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.418
I'll take Alexander

09:01.208 --> 09:03.418
you take Nicky.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.171
Hi, Alexander.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.299
Peek-a-boo!

09:06.213 --> 09:09.299
Peek-a-boo.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.012
Okay, switch.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.931
- Hi.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.931
- Hi, Nicky.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.517
Hi.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.519
Okay, daddy's back.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.979
Come on, D.J.,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.979
let's put the laundry away.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.689
Won't that be fun?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.442
Steph, it's me.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.277
Sorry, I'm better now.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.323
Hi, bud, hey.

09:33.365 --> 09:38.328
I'm older now.

09:33.365 --> 09:38.328
Want me to<i> hold</i> anything?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.620
No, no, thanks, Michelle.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.581
You-you run along

09:39.662 --> 09:41.581
and play, okay?

09:41.622 --> 09:43.417
That what I always do.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.461
Play, play, play.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.759
What?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.094
What was that?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.345
Oh, you want me to take off

09:55.387 --> 09:56.763
those girlie booties.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.473
Hey, guys,

09:56.804 --> 09:58.473
I don't-I don't blame you.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.517
They're outta here.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.851
There we go.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.687
Now we can go back

10:03.186 --> 10:04.687
to being real men.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.274
This little piggy

10:04.729 --> 10:07.274
went to market.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.985
This little piggy, uh,

10:07.315 --> 10:10.985
rode his Harley Davidson.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.739
Oh, Jess. Alexander

10:12.237 --> 10:14.739
needs to be nursed.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.032
Do you want to bring him

10:14.781 --> 10:16.032
in the other room for me?

10:16.074 --> 10:17.367
- 'Sure.'

10:16.074 --> 10:17.367
- Thanks.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.994
Okay, Alexander

10:17.409 --> 10:19.994
needs to be nursed.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.665
Where did your bracelets go?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.376
Hey, Beck.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.712
You guys wait here.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.712
Stay out of the fridge.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.965
Beck, what happened

10:29.754 --> 10:31.965
to the babies bracelets?

10:32.006 --> 10:34.384
Oh, I took 'em off

10:32.006 --> 10:34.384
and put 'em in their baby books.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.844
- How are we tell 'em apart?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.844
- Oh, It's simple.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.138
Alexander's in the peach booties

10:38.179 --> 10:40.390
and Nicky's in

10:38.179 --> 10:40.390
the mint-green ones.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.810
Listen, about these booties..

10:43.851 --> 10:45.770
I really think

10:43.851 --> 10:45.770
they're a little girlie for me.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.064
Jess, my mother

10:45.812 --> 10:48.064
made those booties

10:48.106 --> 10:49.483
and I want

10:48.106 --> 10:49.483
my sons to wear them.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.276
And I don't think

10:49.524 --> 10:51.276
that's not too much to ask.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.527
Why are you putting me

10:51.318 --> 10:52.527
through this?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.780
Sorry. I'm wrong.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.282
Ah, no, I-I love those boot..

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
Any good red-blooded

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
American boy

10:59.200 --> 11:00.743
would love to wear

10:59.200 --> 11:00.743
those booties.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.911
In fact, could you call

11:00.785 --> 11:01.911
your mother up and ask

11:01.953 --> 11:04.705
if she could make

11:01.953 --> 11:04.705
a pair for me?

11:04.747 --> 11:06.958
Oh, I bet she would.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.418
Now, please go

11:07.000 --> 11:08.418
bring me Alexander.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.044
- Okay.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.044
- Thank you.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.132
Alright, guys, we got to put

11:12.464 --> 11:14.132
your booties back on.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.260
Why? Because your mom's about

11:14.174 --> 11:17.260
this far from losing it.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.803
Okay, Alexander,

11:17.302 --> 11:18.803
you had the peach motif.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.430
Which..

11:20.472 --> 11:22.056
Who's Alexander?

11:20.472 --> 11:22.056
Which one-which one of you all..

11:22.098 --> 11:24.601
Fine, whoever's Alexander,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.601
raise your hand.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.146
'Anyone? Anyone?'

11:28.188 --> 11:30.940
Oh, my God.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.940
I don't know who's who.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.859
I mixed up my own kids.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.613
Some father. I can just hear

11:32.900 --> 11:36.613

14:20.735 --> 14:23.237
Fine, fine,

14:20.735 --> 14:23.237
you know, I was thinking.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
You know, wouldn't it be funny

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
if we accidentally

14:25.031 --> 14:28.535
mixed up the kids and we really

14:25.031 --> 14:28.535
didn't know who was who?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.787
Funny?

14:30.829 --> 14:32.539
That would be horrible.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.582
I mean, that

14:32.580 --> 14:34.582
would be a tragedy.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.834
I mean, they'd go through life

14:34.624 --> 14:35.834
never knowing

14:35.875 --> 14:37.752
their true identities.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.213
And that's why

14:37.794 --> 14:40.213
I will never let that happen.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.882
Okay, I'm another day older.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.010
Could I hold that baby<i> now?</i>

14:47.679 --> 14:49.639
Jess, I have a feeling she's

14:47.679 --> 14:49.639
never gonna give up on this.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.057
Ah, I think you're right.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.057
Okay, Michelle.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.267
You gotta sit down.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.267
I'll grab you a kid.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.979
Alright. You sit

14:53.309 --> 14:56.979
back up in there. Okay?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.649
Alright, now remember, you gotta

14:57.021 --> 14:59.649
keep your hand behind his head

14:59.691 --> 15:02.068
and don't jostle him,

14:59.691 --> 15:02.068
and don't drop him and..

15:02.109 --> 15:03.820
Pretty much

15:02.109 --> 15:03.820
don't even move a muscle.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.406
You're making me

15:03.862 --> 15:06.406
very nervous.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.408
Sorry.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.576
Here you go.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.787
- Alright.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.787
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.083
Look at me,

15:13.996 --> 15:17.083
I'm holding a baby.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.294
Look how happy he is, Michelle.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.172
That's because he likes me.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.675
Well, he's your little cousin,

15:23.214 --> 15:25.675
he looks up to you.

15:25.717 --> 15:29.220
If you have any questions,

15:25.717 --> 15:29.220
talk to me.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.889
I love you.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.353
Alright, you two,

15:35.059 --> 15:37.353
have a good show.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.479
Thanks, Mr. Strowbridge.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.022
Vicky, these are for you.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.609
That's very sweet, Bill.

15:42.650 --> 15:47.280
Now, Vicky, give us some of that

15:42.650 --> 15:47.280
Emmy Award winning style.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.909
You, uh, you won an Emmy?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.410
Well, actually,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.410
I won two of them

15:52.452 --> 15:55.580
in DC for

15:52.452 --> 15:55.580
investigative reporting.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.917
I-I thought you said you

15:55.622 --> 15:58.917
never did a talk show before.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.086
That's true, but I anchored

15:58.958 --> 16:02.086
the evening news for five years.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.132
Wow, why didn't you, uh

16:04.046 --> 16:06.132
tell me that?

16:06.173 --> 16:08.217
Because you never

16:06.173 --> 16:08.217
stopped talking.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.845

16:46.297 --> 16:48.466
- Hi, Danny, Vicky.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.134
- Welcome to the show.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.134
- Thank you.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.803
Welcome to the show,

16:50.176 --> 16:51.803
Mr. Woodchuck.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.640
'Thanks, Danny.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.686
Well, Joey's hosting the cartoon

marathon all this week.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.479
Speaking of cartoons..

17:01.521 --> 17:04.064
- Like that segue, Danny?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.064
- Not bad.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.985
Joey, do you feel that

17:04.106 --> 17:06.985
violence in cartoons today

17:07.026 --> 17:11.280
has an adverse effect on our

17:07.026 --> 17:11.280
children's social consciousness?

17:11.322 --> 17:13.700
- Well, actually, Vicky--

- Uh, excuse me, Vicky, please.

17:13.741 --> 17:17.119
Joey's just a sweet,

loveable, goofy guy.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.705
Please don't try

17:17.161 --> 17:18.705
and clog his head

17:18.746 --> 17:21.123
with this kind

17:18.746 --> 17:21.123
of controversial issues.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.960
Actually, Vicky, I'm glad

17:21.165 --> 17:23.960
I finally have the chance

17:24.002 --> 17:26.504
to articulate my position.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.339
Articulate?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.466
Yes, I've given this issue

17:28.381 --> 17:30.466
a lot of thought

17:30.508 --> 17:34.220
and while violence is certainly

17:30.508 --> 17:34.220
endemic to our society

17:34.261 --> 17:36.096
on my show, I only run cartoons

17:36.138 --> 17:39.559
where the violence

17:36.138 --> 17:39.559
is non-reality based.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.811
That is to say,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.811
if we see a mouse

17:41.853 --> 17:44.063
drop a battleship on a cat

17:44.104 --> 17:45.439
the emulation of that act

17:45.481 --> 17:49.193
by a small child

17:45.481 --> 17:49.193
would be virtually impossible.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.529
That's a fascinating

17:49.235 --> 17:51.529
observation.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.947
Yeah, especially

17:51.571 --> 17:52.947
coming from a man

17:52.989 --> 17:55.199
who plays Jingle Bells

17:52.989 --> 17:55.199
on his armpits.

17:56.868 --> 18:00.371
We'll be back with

17:56.868 --> 18:00.371
more Ranger Joe, Ph.D.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.373
And we're clear.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.833
Great interview, Joey.

18:03.875 --> 18:04.959
Oh, thanks, Vicky.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.377
You know,

18:05.001 --> 18:06.377
you're really wonderful.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.005
Thank you.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.005
Excuse me.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.009
What do you, what do you mean,

18:11.049 --> 18:13.009
she's wonderful?

18:13.051 --> 18:15.803
She's overbearing,

18:13.051 --> 18:15.803
abrasive, and arrogant.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.848
Man, you are so hot for her.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.017
I know. She's going

18:18.890 --> 18:21.017
to drive me nuts.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.021
Okay, ready for round two?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.773
Yep, let's get it on.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.985
I mean, let's get on with it.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.446
The show.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.822
Hi, we're back.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.700
And we're talking

18:34.864 --> 18:37.700
with the cartoon show host..

18:37.742 --> 18:40.578
Here you go, Uncle Jesse.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.578
My "Junior Detective" kit.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.413
Shh. Keep your voice down.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.748
Why? What do you need this for?

18:43.790 --> 18:44.874
I can't tell you.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.626
Then I can't let you use it.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.505
Alright, girls, I'm going

18:49.128 --> 18:51.505
to tell you a secret

18:51.547 --> 18:52.966
but you can't tell Becky.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.009
Because, well, you know

18:53.007 --> 18:55.009
how she's been.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.135
Nuts?

18:56.176 --> 18:57.095
Well, she hasn't been nuts.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.387
She's..

18:57.136 --> 18:58.387
Yeah, nuts.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.889
Yeah, she's been nuts.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.016
What happened was,

18:59.931 --> 19:02.016
I mixed the twins up

19:02.058 --> 19:03.559
and I can't tell who's who.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.770
(in unison)

19:03.601 --> 19:05.770
What?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.396
They're your own kids.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.483
Even baboons know

19:07.438 --> 19:10.483
their own babies.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.657
Out!

19:18.783 --> 19:20.660
Ooh! Sore spot.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.831
Alright, this is what we do.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.290
What I'm gonna do is

19:24.872 --> 19:26.290
I'm gonna take a footprint

19:26.332 --> 19:27.667
of one of the babies

19:26.332 --> 19:27.667
and I'm gonna compare it

19:27.708 --> 19:29.627
to the original

19:27.708 --> 19:29.627
in the birth certificate

19:29.669 --> 19:30.795
Right here, okay.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.297
Deej, get the ink out.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.297
I'll take, uh..

19:34.674 --> 19:36.092
...whoever you are.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.220
Alrighty.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.220
Here we go.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.640
Here we go.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.640
Okay, ready?

19:42.682 --> 19:45.935
And ink him.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.729
Son, this better be

19:45.977 --> 19:48.729
your last set of prints.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.317
Okay, and we do this.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.403
Look at that, see?

19:56.445 --> 19:58.322
Alright, now, we just compare it

19:56.445 --> 19:58.322
with the original

19:58.364 --> 19:59.907
and we'll be Jake.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.118
(Becky)

19:59.949 --> 20:02.118
'Hey, where is everybody?'

20:02.160 --> 20:03.452
We're in here!

20:03.494 --> 20:04.453
Shh! Stephanie.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.040
No, we're not!

20:07.623 --> 20:10.376
Look at this.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.213
Becky's going to see this.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.213
D.J., help me, uh.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.298
Uh, let's put his foot

20:14.254 --> 20:16.298
in my pocket.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.559
Oh, here you are.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.602
Jess, it's time

20:26.600 --> 20:28.602
to feed the boys.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.022
Uh, I think I hear dad calling.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.482
Coming, dad!

20:34.441 --> 20:36.610
Dad's at the store.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.529
You are really having a bad day.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.376
Jess, is-is there some reason

20:52.418 --> 20:54.587
that our son's foot

20:52.418 --> 20:54.587
is in your pocket?

20:59.175 --> 21:00.843
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.843
Well, there's a-there's a..

21:00.885 --> 21:03.596
There's a-there's a perfectly,

21:00.885 --> 21:03.596
perfectly good reason.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.640
And-and that is

21:03.637 --> 21:06.640
because, uh..

21:06.682 --> 21:09.852
Well, well, because he kicked

21:06.682 --> 21:09.852
his bootie off and-and he..

21:09.894 --> 21:11.938
I wanted to keep his foot warm.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.272
There you go. There's a..

21:13.313 --> 21:16.442
There's a perfectly

21:13.313 --> 21:16.442
good reason.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.073
Is there

21:20.446 --> 21:22.073
a perfectly good reason

21:22.115 --> 21:23.991
that his foot's

21:22.115 --> 21:23.991
covered with ink?

21:25.534 --> 21:26.869
Where's my head today?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.996
I must have left another

21:26.911 --> 21:28.996
ink pad in my pocket.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.005
Why don't you

21:36.336 --> 21:38.005
tell me the truth?

21:43.094 --> 21:44.553
Well, the truth is.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.805
I was taking

21:44.595 --> 21:45.805
his footprints

21:45.846 --> 21:47.890
because I took

21:45.846 --> 21:47.890
their booties off

21:47.932 --> 21:51.102
and...now I can't

21:47.932 --> 21:51.102
tell them apart.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.686
Some great dad, huh?

21:52.728 --> 21:56.149
Even baboons can tell

21:52.728 --> 21:56.149
their kids apart.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.192
Honey, why didn't you tell me?

21:58.234 --> 22:01.445
I was just trying to avoid

21:58.234 --> 22:01.445
the mother of all mood swings.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.074
Honey, I know

22:02.780 --> 22:05.074
I've been real crazy lately

22:05.116 --> 22:07.326
but if there's some problem with

22:05.116 --> 22:07.326
our kids, you have to tell me

22:07.367 --> 22:08.911
so we can work it out together.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.038
I know, I just..

22:11.080 --> 22:13.707
I just want to be

22:11.080 --> 22:13.707
the perfect dad, that's all.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.418
There is no such thing

22:13.749 --> 22:16.418
as the perfect dad.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.296
But you're gonna be a great dad.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.589
And you're already

22:18.337 --> 22:20.589
a great husband.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.008
And I love you.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.051
Have mercy.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.097
Well, we're doing

22:26.637 --> 22:28.097
pretty good so far.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.683
I mean, our kids are happy,

22:28.139 --> 22:30.683
they're healthy.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.852
We just don't know

22:30.724 --> 22:32.852
who the heck they are.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.646
But I'm gonna find out

22:32.893 --> 22:35.646
right now. Alright.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.024
Now, let's see.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.024
This one..

22:38.065 --> 22:40.609
See, he's got

22:38.065 --> 22:40.609
a little squiggle here

22:40.651 --> 22:42.444
and a little squig..

22:42.486 --> 22:44.322
We have a match.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.533
You, you with the inky foot,

22:44.362 --> 22:47.533
my friend..

22:47.574 --> 22:49.202
...are Big Al.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.830
'Isn't that

22:50.244 --> 22:52.830
great news, guys?'

22:52.872 --> 22:55.166
'Eh, they're so excited,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.166
they're speechless.'

22:55.208 --> 22:57.168
Fellas, I've been

22:55.208 --> 22:57.168
going crazy all day.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.129
I found out who you are.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.129
You're Al. You're Nicky.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.380
High five.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.380
Give me high five.
