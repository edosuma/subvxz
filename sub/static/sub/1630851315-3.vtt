you know? Life stuff.

at Officer Hayward's place.

and Julie and her
nine toothbrushes.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.735
Dad's cool with me staying
here a couple of days.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.522
Unless you want me to go back.No.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.262
You can stay.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.612
You seem stressed, though.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.576
You're doing the mom thing.Oh, you mean the thing

22:40.620 --> 22:42.665
where I want to make sure
my son's okay?

22:42.709 --> 22:44.972
Yeah, that.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.891
I'd be better
if I had a burger.

22:50.934 --> 22:54.111
Well, there are some veggie
patties in the freezer.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.549
How are you scared
of a nine-year-old?

22:56.592 --> 22:57.898
The same way you are.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.904
KAI:
You should put a cold
compress on that lip.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.297
Looks swollen is all.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.647
[Jesse laughs]

23:07.690 --> 23:08.909
You don't hit that hard.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.301
[laughs]

23:10.345 --> 23:11.694
Hey, you were good.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.435
In interrogation?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.306
10,000 hour rule.

23:15.350 --> 23:18.222
Those 10,000 hours tell you
who did it?He's lying.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.355
That I know.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.836
How much he's lying,
we'll find out.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.274
Shouldn't you be,
like, heading back

23:26.317 --> 23:28.755
to your sad bachelor
pad or something?
No.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.539
Sticking around here
waiting on callbacks

23:30.583 --> 23:32.019
from Brad's alibi.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.064
Oh, well, his friends will
back him up,

23:34.108 --> 23:35.370
but that doesn't mean much.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.503
Maybe, maybe not.

23:37.546 --> 23:40.375
[sighs]
You think he's some kid

23:40.419 --> 23:42.116
that just got mixed up
with the wrong crowd.

23:42.159 --> 23:46.381
But he had a dream to leave,
do more with his life.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.471
Are we talking about Brad
or you?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.212
You left.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.693
Joined the Marines,
did more with your life.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.869
We having a heart-to-heart?

23:55.912 --> 23:57.697
[laughs]

23:57.740 --> 23:59.438
Hey, just an observation.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.442
Hey, you want to know
what I've observed?

24:05.008 --> 24:08.098
You are convinced that Hayward's
into something shady,

24:08.142 --> 24:10.536
and maybe that's
personal experience.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.325
Hey, I hope his alibi
checks out.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.117
Okay. Okay, thank you.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.861
Brad's prints from the soda can
are a match

24:31.905 --> 24:33.210
for the ones on Hayward's body.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.343
TENNANT:
Prints don't stay
on a body long.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.084
Brad must have been
the recruit that Hayward saw

24:37.127 --> 24:38.825
after Kekoa left
the stadium.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.174
TENNANT:
Where are we with the warrant?

24:40.217 --> 24:41.567
Waiting for the judge
to sign off.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.003
KAI:
Hey, you might want
to put a pause

24:43.046 --> 24:44.483
on that warrant.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.658
Someone just confessed
to the murder.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.010
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

24:56.103 --> 24:58.192
[door buzzes, latch clicks]

24:59.585 --> 25:01.064
Sunny Oania.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.422
I got connections
outside these walls.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.555
My boys don't make a move
without me knowing.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.515
Why go after a Navy recruiter?I got word

25:16.558 --> 25:18.473
he wen come to my
beach, trying to fill

25:18.517 --> 25:21.476
the boys' heads
with all sorts of nonsense.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.913
Not a reason to kill someone.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.480
He was warned first.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.177
Didn't heed.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.092
The oranges.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.441
SUNNY:
Cheaper than a bat.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.356
More effective, too.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.750
I don't buy it.

25:34.794 --> 25:37.013
Excuse me?
LUCY:
The Oania Boys

25:37.057 --> 25:39.015
fight turf wars all the time,

25:39.059 --> 25:41.104
but it doesn't spill out
beyond the gang.

25:45.021 --> 25:49.591
Right after 8:00 p.m.,
outside Aloha Stadium.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.288
Two in the chest,

25:51.332 --> 25:53.856
one up close
to make sure the guy's dead.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.684
Those details

25:55.728 --> 25:57.686
are not in the public report.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.732
Who pulled the trigger?

25:59.775 --> 26:01.995
You throw a stone
on this island,

26:02.038 --> 26:05.085
you find a meth-head
willing to do whatever.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.956
Buyer's market.

26:10.351 --> 26:13.615
I'm willing to sign
the confession right now.

26:13.659 --> 26:16.096
Let's do it.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.577
Let's wait a beat.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.586
[door buzzes]

26:27.629 --> 26:29.457
[latch clicks, door opens]

26:29.500 --> 26:31.720
Got to admit,
Sunny's story's compelling.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.417
Has motive, too.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.854
Yeah, but it still
doesn't explain

26:34.897 --> 26:37.334
why Hayward had the gun
or Brad's prints on him.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.467
Is that why you didn't take
the confession?

26:39.510 --> 26:42.078
[phone buzzing][clicks phone off]

26:42.122 --> 26:44.515
Look, someone in the gang
wanted Hayward dead.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.648
But killing a sailor
just to send a message?

26:46.692 --> 26:47.693
Nah.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.433
[phone buzzing]

26:50.478 --> 26:51.653
Look, can we talk later?

26:51.697 --> 26:53.655
I'm in the middle
of something.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.396
Wait, what?

26:55.439 --> 26:56.571
No, he said
that you...

26:56.615 --> 26:59.226
Okay, look, wires
got crossed...

26:59.269 --> 27:00.880
Uh, pineapple.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.098
Pineapple!

27:03.143 --> 27:04.535
Okay.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.581
I'll take care of it.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.197
My ex.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.112
Yeah, I figured.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.288
Pineapple?Yeah, we had a
couples counselor once

27:18.332 --> 27:20.116
that told us to think
of a safe word

27:20.160 --> 27:21.509
in case things ever got heated.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.424
Maybe I should try that.Well, he is

27:23.467 --> 27:24.904
my ex-husband.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.166
Yeah, maybe not.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.646
What's going on?

27:29.299 --> 27:32.172
Alex convinced me that his dad
said it was okay for him

27:32.215 --> 27:35.741
to come back home, and then told
his dad that it was my idea.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.481
Clever.
You got to give it to him.

27:37.525 --> 27:40.049
But he forgot that you
and his dad still talk.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.703
You want me to book him,
haul him in,

27:41.747 --> 27:43.400
scare him straight?[knocking at door?]

27:44.314 --> 27:46.447
Found something you should see.

27:46.490 --> 27:50.059
I was wondering why Sunny Oania
was adamant on confessing,

27:50.103 --> 27:53.062
so we did a deep dive
on his financials.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.543
This is Sunny's bank statements
for the last year.

27:55.586 --> 27:56.979
Had some good investments.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.502
Conservative but smart.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.852
Money market. T-bills.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.027
LUCY:
And every month,

28:01.070 --> 28:02.463
there's a recurring
payment to...

28:04.857 --> 28:06.119
...Andrea Pacheco.

28:06.162 --> 28:08.295
Brad's mother, but
it's not alimony.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.732
It's child support.
ERNIE:
I went through

28:10.776 --> 28:12.603
his school records--
no father listed.

28:12.647 --> 28:13.909
DMV-- nothing.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.650
[taps keys]Then...

28:15.694 --> 28:18.305
I got a scan
of his birth certificate.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.265
KAI:
Sunny is Brad's father.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.528
Means the leader of
the Oania Boys, Lee,

28:24.572 --> 28:26.139
is Brad's
half brother.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.749
Yeah, that explains
the confession.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.403
Sunny wasn't protecting
his crew...

28:29.446 --> 28:31.231
He was protecting his son.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.669
It all goes back to Brad.
Do we go at him again?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.889
KAI:
No, Jesse already
took a run.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.760
He won't talk
if we bring him in.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.371
We go to him.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.591
Yeah? Got an idea?

28:43.634 --> 28:46.637
Brad may be surrounded
by his crew, but he's alone.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.639
He's gonna need
someone who understands

28:48.683 --> 28:50.076
what he's going through.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.735
KAI:
Waves died down, ya?

28:57.823 --> 28:59.650
Mo bettah earlier.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.348
[sighs]

29:01.391 --> 29:04.307
You know, I never got
into bodyboarding, but...

29:04.351 --> 29:07.267
must be something about your
heart being close to the waves.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.052
When you're out there,
the whole world just disappears.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.794
Is that why you considered
the Navy?

29:12.838 --> 29:14.796
Stay close to the water?

29:19.845 --> 29:22.282
Staff Sergeant Eric Rodriguez.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.372
Came to my pop's restaurant
wearing that uniform, and...

29:25.415 --> 29:27.940
he was only a few years older
than me, but...

29:27.983 --> 29:30.551
he was so confident, you know?

29:30.594 --> 29:32.596
Gave me a path to the future.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.470
You served?

29:36.513 --> 29:39.429
Changed my life.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.736
Made me who I am.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.999
Yeah.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.179
Well, my life's
right in front of me.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.051
You get rejected?

29:53.226 --> 29:55.184
'Cause I lied
about running with the crew.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.882
Future over.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.710
That's rough.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.583
Recruiter just cut you off,
huh, like you don't exist?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.716
Nah, brah.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.849
He said he'd work it out.

30:07.893 --> 30:11.548
Told me and my ma he could get
some kind of waiver.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.420
That won't happen now.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.597
'Cause he was murdered.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.208
You're a cop now, huh?

30:21.123 --> 30:22.603
Trying to trick me
into confessing?

30:22.646 --> 30:24.387
I don't think
you killed Hayward.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.520
But look, you can call
your boys at any time,

30:26.563 --> 30:28.130
end this conversation.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.567
But I want to help you.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.700
I just need you to talk.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.837
What do you want to know?

30:40.751 --> 30:43.319
Tell me about the gun
Hayward was hiding for you.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.061
It was Lee's.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.935
He told me to get rid of it.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.937
I was freaked out.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.895
I went to Hayward.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.768
He was gonna turn it in
after I went to boot camp.

30:57.812 --> 31:00.119
When was the last time
you saw Miles Hayward?

31:00.162 --> 31:02.208
Aloha Stadium.
He had this whole plan

31:02.251 --> 31:04.253
to get me
off the island.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.429
He gave me a hug,
said he'd reach out the next day

31:06.473 --> 31:07.996
once it was all set.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.086
When I didn't hear nothin',
I just...

31:12.392 --> 31:14.960
...thought he changed his mind.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.006
Anyone else know about the gun?

31:18.050 --> 31:19.355
No way.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.966
If Lee found out
Hayward had it...

31:22.010 --> 31:23.751
He'd kill him.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.189
Brad's story makes sense.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.843
Lee does the shooting
at the tourist shop.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.671
He tells Brad to toss the gun.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.020
Lee must have found out somehow
that Hayward had it.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.587
TENNANT:
And murdered him

31:33.630 --> 31:35.632
before he could do anything
with it.What was Brad doing

31:35.676 --> 31:37.417
with Hayward the
night he was shot?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.419
They were planning a way
for Brad to get out.

31:39.462 --> 31:40.942
Lee probably followed him there
without him knowing.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.248
That explains why Brad

31:42.291 --> 31:44.119
was so guarded
when Hayward didn't reach out.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.599
All right, so where's Brad now?

31:45.642 --> 31:46.861
I told him to go back
to his house

31:46.905 --> 31:47.906
and lay low.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.255
The rest of the crew is
at a house

31:49.298 --> 31:50.778
on the maukaside
of Farrington Highway.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.606
We need to roll Lee up
right away.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.612
How many we got?

31:58.655 --> 32:01.136
KAI:
I count Lee, maybe five others,
all external.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.400
Rear stack with me.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.102
How pissed do you
think Lee's gonna be

32:10.145 --> 32:11.930
when he finds out
you're a federal agent?

32:11.973 --> 32:13.757
We're about to find out.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.282
[indistinct chatter]

32:22.941 --> 32:24.899
NCIS! Everyone
on the ground!

32:27.380 --> 32:29.904
Bottles down. Interlace your
fingers behind your head. Go.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.210
Turn around!

32:31.253 --> 32:32.298
[grunting]

32:32.341 --> 32:33.647

around for me!

32:45.441 --> 32:46.573
Runner down.

32:46.616 --> 32:47.966
[over radio]:
No sign of Lee.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.055
One more down. It's not Lee.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.710
Lee's on the staircase!

33:00.891 --> 33:02.241
[gunshots]

33:03.285 --> 33:03.938
Yeah, he's
pretty pissed.

[bullet ricochets]

33:15.036 --> 33:17.212
Barricaded shooter
in an elevated position.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.822
They teach you to talk like that
in the Marines?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.868
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'll use cop words.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.826
Guy up there. Gun. Bad.

33:22.870 --> 33:25.003
All right, smart-ass,
what would the Marines do?

33:26.569 --> 33:27.875
Call in an airstrike.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.355
There's a lanai
in the back.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.139
Jesse, you good?

33:31.183 --> 33:34.012
[bullets ricocheting]

33:34.055 --> 33:35.709
Peachy.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.020
You're gonna give me a boost.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.499
It's okay. I was a flyer.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.762
I don't...I... I'll explain later.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.590
Just come...Okay.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.040
Great.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.392
That was fast.She was something

34:06.435 --> 34:07.654
called a flyer.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.396
Cheerleader who gets
thrown in the air.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.094
Have a daughter,
you'll understand.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.096
KAI:
Give yourself up!
No one needs to get hurt!

34:15.140 --> 34:16.097
[gunshots]

34:16.141 --> 34:17.142
[gun clicking]

34:23.670 --> 34:24.845
Don't move!

34:27.456 --> 34:28.805
Got him.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.682
ANDREA:
Lee killed the recruiter?

34:38.250 --> 34:41.122
We believe Hayward could connect
Lee to another unsolved crime.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
He's just like his father.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.821
Brad's father, too.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.868
I paid Sunny a visit.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.478
Not many people know.

34:49.522 --> 34:52.220
We both thought it best
to keep it that way.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.830
But Brad's a blessing.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.310
Well, he's safe now

34:55.354 --> 34:56.703
to pursue
whatever future he wants.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.184
Future's what's caused
all this.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.969
Brad never should have gotten
involved with that recruiter.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.102
It's been nothing but trouble.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.409
Do you mind if I speak to Brad?

35:07.453 --> 35:09.019
He'll be out soon.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.021
I'm making some tea if you want.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.719
That'd be great.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.683
You're a traitor to your people.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.903
JESSE:
'Cause he doesn't spend his days

35:22.946 --> 35:25.210
beating up tourists
and extorting local businesses?

35:25.253 --> 35:28.648
Oh, you left out, uh,
betraying his own family.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.824
Not much
of an older brother.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.478
What are you talking about?

35:32.521 --> 35:33.957
KAI:
Murder.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.134
Talking about murder, Lee.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.310
I didn't kill that guy
at the tourist shop.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.790
I seen him. He's fine.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.879
We're not talking
about the tourist shop.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.881
We're talking
about Petty Officer Hayward,

35:44.925 --> 35:46.492
the one person
who actually cared

35:46.535 --> 35:48.102
about giving Brad a chance.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.582
The Navy dude?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.497
You're not pinning
that on me.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.586
I roughed him up, but that's it.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.848
Hey,

35:54.891 --> 35:56.850
you're already down
for the count here.

35:56.893 --> 35:58.895
The tourist shop;
shooting at federal agents.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.462
Might as well cop
to Hayward's murder.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.725
Sunny put you up to it,
right?

36:02.769 --> 36:04.336
No.

36:04.379 --> 36:05.598
Sunny wanted Brad

36:05.641 --> 36:08.122
as far away
from this life as possible.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.211
He told us to back
off of Hayward

36:10.255 --> 36:12.039
after we tuned him up.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.564
He's not the one trying
to keep Brad in the fold.

36:15.608 --> 36:18.480
Okay. Then who is?

36:19.742 --> 36:22.136
[teakettle whistling][buzzing]

36:22.180 --> 36:23.920
How did you find out

36:23.964 --> 36:25.966
about Lee?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.186
We had a source.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.578
Someone in the gang?

36:29.622 --> 36:30.884
You thought it was honorable,

36:30.927 --> 36:32.494
Brad wanting to be in the Navy.

36:32.538 --> 36:33.887
I was so proudof him.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.976
And devastated
when he was rejected.

36:36.019 --> 36:38.065
Well, I'm sure it was a relief
when Hayward offered a waiver

36:38.108 --> 36:39.153
to get Brad back in.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.112
He did?

36:42.156 --> 36:44.506
Hayward came by
to tell you both.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.813
That's what Brad said, anyways.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.817
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding
we can clarify.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.167
Let's ask your son.Stop.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.519
Brad's tired.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.129
He's been
through a lot.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.653
Let's do this another time.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.917
I don't blame you
for not wanting Brad to go.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.701
He was about to join
a new family.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.529
I'm his only family.

37:07.573 --> 37:08.704
[phone buzzing]

37:08.748 --> 37:11.054
Even when Brad was rejected,

37:11.098 --> 37:13.274
Hayward persisted.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.580
You knew
he wouldn't stop.

37:14.623 --> 37:15.972
And Brad
would leave you,

37:16.016 --> 37:18.845
and with Sunny gone,
you would be all alone.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.021
He was going to take my boy!

37:21.064 --> 37:22.283
But you killed him
before he could.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.502
[Andrea grunts]

37:34.339 --> 37:35.905
[gunshot]

37:39.692 --> 37:41.476
Give it to me.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.869
[breathing shakily]

37:45.306 --> 37:47.090
No.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.179
You took everything away.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.833
ANDREA:
Don't believe
her lies!

37:50.877 --> 37:52.008
I would never do...

37:52.052 --> 37:53.619
It was the only thing I had.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.012
Brad...

37:56.056 --> 37:57.579
listen.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.234
If you do this,
there's no going back.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.757
This is not
who you are.

38:01.801 --> 38:04.717
You are not
like them.

38:04.760 --> 38:09.069
You're just a good kid
who has a bright future.

38:09.112 --> 38:11.550
Hayward was trying
to show you that.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.553
Don't prove him wrong.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.965
KAI:
Lee may have been in charge,

38:36.009 --> 38:38.881
but Brad's mom has been involved
ever since Sunny went away.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.014
Now they're both
going away, too.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.321
The Oania Boys
are basically done.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.627
Still, it was never
about the gang.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.629
Andrea just
couldn't let Brad go.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.631
Supposed to help them make
the right choices in life.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.633
Instead, she took them away.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.114
Well, Hayward's getting
the justice he deserves,

38:54.157 --> 38:56.377
and Brad has a chance
at a future.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.641
Thanks to you
connecting with him.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.382
Just doing my job.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.471
It's more than that to you.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.301
It's hard being back, right?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.956
Facing what might be easier
to forget.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.002
It's all right.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.614
I mean, I can't change the past.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.573
But I can help Brad
with his next step.

39:18.617 --> 39:21.402
I followed up on the waiver
Hayward started,

39:21.446 --> 39:23.404
and the good word
from an island-boy-turned-Marine

39:23.448 --> 39:25.232
didn't hurt.See?

39:25.275 --> 39:26.886
Nice job.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.715
Now, get out of here.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.637
Burgers?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.247
Julie finds out, we're
both in deep trouble.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.857
Well, you're gonna help me
destroy the evidence

39:41.901 --> 39:42.989
when we're done.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.686
But first...

39:45.731 --> 39:47.646
Your dad called.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.955
I just,
I don't want to be there.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.174
Look, I know
this hasn't been easy...

39:54.217 --> 39:55.480
They already
made a nursery,

39:55.523 --> 39:57.438
and the baby's not even here.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.658
I'm sleeping
on a couch.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.620
Your dad's dealing
with a new situation, okay?

40:05.664 --> 40:07.666
I know you are, too.
I get it.

40:07.709 --> 40:09.319
So it's cool I'm here?

40:09.363 --> 40:10.582
Absolutely not.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.148
You lied to me

40:12.192 --> 40:13.585
and your father.
You hurt his feelings,

40:13.628 --> 40:15.543
and you put me
in the middle of it.

40:15.587 --> 40:18.503
You're not a child
anymore.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.548
Your choices matter.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.770
What choice do I have now?

40:24.813 --> 40:26.162
To take responsibility

40:26.206 --> 40:28.469
for your actions.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.297
Or not.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.171
I'll call Dad.

40:36.564 --> 40:38.740
And go back.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.745
Can I at least have
a burger first?

40:43.789 --> 40:45.051
After...

40:45.094 --> 40:46.879
you call your father.

40:47.923 --> 40:49.272
Yeah.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.189
Okay.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.496
[line ringing]

40:55.540 --> 40:57.890
Hey, Dad.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.805
Yeah.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.503
Um, so, about yesterday,

41:02.547 --> 41:05.941
Mom didn't really say
that I could...

41:05.985 --> 41:08.161
KAI:
In life...

41:08.204 --> 41:10.511
there are people
who show up for you.

41:10.555 --> 41:13.645
No matter what the cost,
no matter how hard it gets,

41:13.688 --> 41:15.821
they're always there.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.866
That's the best of us.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.435
What we can all aspire to.

41:21.479 --> 41:25.091
The model
for what it means to serve.

41:25.134 --> 41:27.746
Petty Officer Miles
Hayward believed

41:27.789 --> 41:30.923
in each and every
one of you.

You're beginning
the next chapter

41:33.534 --> 41:36.232
of becoming
fine young men and women.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.470
What you doing here?
