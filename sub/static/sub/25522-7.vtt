01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
What the hell?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.368
Good morning.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.580
You took off my clothes?

02:44.790 --> 02:45.915
They were ruined.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.377
I brought some ice.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.256
That ankle of yours is very swollen.

02:54.466 --> 02:58.302
You must have taken
quite a nasty spill last night.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.680
Amma knows better.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.516
Tearing down those stairs
with the landing light off...

03:03.600 --> 03:06.102
Thank God you caught her.
She could have cracked her skull.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.229
You're quite the protector.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.191
Mama, I gotta go. I gotta go to work.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.609
Lie back, Camille.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.070
-No, I have a deadline...
-Lie back.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.206
A little bit of sweet

03:29.960 --> 03:31.794
before the bitter. It helps.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.922
Open.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.218
Then a bit more sweet,
and a day in bed,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
that's my prescription.

03:42.139 --> 03:46.350
Mama, I really do have
to get to work today, okay?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.020
Camille.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.941
Will you let me wrap
your ankle for you, please?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.864
Go away, please.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.118
I'm sorry. I'm just...

04:05.579 --> 04:08.915
I'm tired, and I really gotta
get some work done today.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.793
Well, make it a short day,
and come right back to me.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.755
This has been coming a while.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.215
Your health

04:19.301 --> 04:21.427
is not a debt you just cancel.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.221
The body collects, Camille.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.906
Hello, ladies.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.742
Here. Keep it.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.087
Fueling up for the day, there, Billy?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.130
I see you are, as well.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.925
Just helps the fuel go down easy.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.428
I still owe you a conversation.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.430
No, I... I got what I needed.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.183
Really? There something I should know?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.187
Okay, then.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.107
-How's our girl?
-Jocelyn is fine.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.358
I'll give her your regards.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.693
No, I meant the other one.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.570
Are we gonna keep doing this?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.533
Well, we can do
what we always do around here,

05:25.617 --> 05:27.284
and pretend it doesn't exist.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.121
-I like that better.
-Do you?

05:32.374 --> 05:34.709
Well, I'm off to protect and serve.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.461
I'm off to mix and serve.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.094
You okay?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.722
She gave you the blue?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.141
No, I didn't want it.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.145
You know what my favorite part
about getting wasted is?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.441
Mama takes care of me after.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.194
I think you can take care of yourself.

06:02.279 --> 06:06.532
I want Mama,
and she wants me like this.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.121
Don't do this for her, okay?

06:14.249 --> 06:15.750
You don't have to.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.511
What? I'm not allowed
to touch her room?

06:27.596 --> 06:28.888
Not even here?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.560
They're arresting him today.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.604
John?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.149
Roy says
killer going down today.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.568
Roy's Kelsey's cousin.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.820
Works for, like, a judge or something.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.656
Didn't Dick tell you?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.588
Hey.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.632
Checking in? Or just a bupe-and-go?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.802
I'm looking for a Beverly Van Lumm.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.845
We don't give out names.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.433
But she's not a patient.
She's a nurse.

07:14.518 --> 07:15.851
We don't give out names.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.562
Shit.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.023
You're that cop.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.943
Man, I never met
anybody famous before...

07:24.027 --> 07:26.320
Could you just help me out here?
Beverly Van Lumm.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
You're looking for me?

07:33.745 --> 07:35.913
I got your name from Jackie O'Neill.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.668
She said you might know something
about a Marian Crellin.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.169
Go back
to your seat, ma'am.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.921
I'll call you
when the doctor is ready.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.600
Go on in.
I'll be right there.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.726
All right, Chief.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.023
What is going on here?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.442
Ashley, just wait one second.
Just wait one second.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.735
No.
Just let me go inside.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.113
-Why are you at my house?
-We have a search warrant.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.490
-Why?
-Just go on inside.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.658
Go on.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.043
Where's John at?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.838
He went for a drive,
and he hasn't come back.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.423
- When?
- Last night.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.720
Ashley, sweetheart.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.932
For his sake, for your sake,
you don't want to go to jail.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.435
-You need to tell me where he's at.
-I don't know where he's at.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.272
I can't just abandon him.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.357
I'd look like a total bitch.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.903
Fact is, you'd be helping him,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.907
and, in the eyes of the town,
you'd be a hero.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.076
Ashley, you help us, everyone,

08:56.161 --> 08:57.661
everyone will know how brave you were

08:57.787 --> 09:00.039
to help save
the lives of little girls.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.627
You mean, like, my name in the paper?

09:06.588 --> 09:08.714
Face on TV, I reckon.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.184
He'd never have sex with me.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.979
What did she die from?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.106
That's the thing.
She got passed around.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.943
Different doctors,
different diagnoses.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.489
Crohn's. Heart palpitations.
Respiratory issues.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.617
Gastrointestinal issues,
renal issues...

09:36.701 --> 09:37.785
Jesus.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.746
All those conditions suspected,
but none confirmed.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.539
The night she died,

09:42.666 --> 09:45.125
the attending was a guy
who'd never seen her before.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.711
But she was treated there
for years. She has a chart.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.047
This chart?
It's a choose-your-own-adventure.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.967
The records weren't great back then.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.803
The nurses, we were the records.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.513
I kept a copy.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.515
Thought it might
come in handy one day.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.147
Munchausen's by proxy syndrome, MBP.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.941
That's what killed Marian?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.442
Yes.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.696
It's a mental illness, in adults.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.740
Munchausen's is when
you hurt yourself to get attention.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.618
You make yourself sick,
everyone's at your beck and call.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.163
Munchausen's by proxy,
on the other hand,

10:23.248 --> 10:25.291
is when you make someone else sick

10:25.959 --> 10:28.961
so you can care for them,
so you can save them.

10:29.504 --> 10:33.048
Or try. Be seen trying.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.718
You're saying Adora has this.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.554
I'm saying people have this.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.597
Mostly mothers.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.684
Mothers who need to be worshiped,
to be heroes.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.144
Nothing more laudable than a woman

10:45.228 --> 10:47.604
who puts all her energy
into her sick child.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.150
You denied every request
for information.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.735
I did what the doctors told me to.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.902
Why didn't you tell the police?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.529
I did,

10:55.613 --> 10:57.281
and I lost my job at the hospital,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.575
after which I never heard
another thing about it.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.204
I still have friends
at Woodberry Hospital,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.957
if you're curious to talk to them,

11:07.042 --> 11:08.459
not about Marian.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.628
About the other one.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.846
Come on. Let's get you in bed.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.931
Come on.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.350
-Come on.
-I don't want it.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.060
-Come on.
-I don't want it.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.398
-Amma.
-I'm not really sick.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.693
-I'm just...
-You're just what?

11:34.819 --> 11:36.945
Had a few beers last night. I'm sorry.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.118
She was a bad influence on Marian.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.620
She's a bad influence

11:45.830 --> 11:46.872
on you.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.167
No, she's not.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.339
Well, the cure's much the same.

11:55.423 --> 11:59.176
What is all this but dehydration,
vitamin deficiency, exhaustion...

11:59.260 --> 12:01.261
Mama, I really feel okay.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.014
Just some sleep...

12:08.770 --> 12:11.063
Maybe a grilled cheese.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.733
I don't think so.

12:16.611 --> 12:20.406
I mean, you don't need me
to make you feel better.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.286
You don't need me to
make you a grilled cheese.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.372
But I don't know how.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.998
No, no, no. Go on.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.086
Do your own laundry
while you're at it.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
-Mama...
-Clean your own room...

12:38.049 --> 12:40.426
Pay your own way, and...

12:41.177 --> 12:43.262
Yeah, you don't need
this anymore, do you?

12:43.346 --> 12:45.514
-No, Mama, please. Stop.
-Playtime is over, right?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.599
You're much too mature
for all of this...

12:47.684 --> 12:49.017
Don't... Stop it!

13:05.285 --> 13:09.788
It hurts me, that you don't trust me
to do the best for you.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.214
- Check this. One, two.
- Three, four.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.550
One, two, three. One, two...

13:22.177 --> 13:25.345
Hi. You know where else
you can get a drink this time of day

13:25.430 --> 13:26.680
in this shitty town?

13:26.764 --> 13:29.725
This is it, unless you head over
to Bean Town.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.145
But you'd have to like
the smell of blood and piss.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.106
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later.

13:36.191 --> 13:39.735
-Check, baby. One, two.
-Three, four.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.032
There he is.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.707
Well, looks like we caught our killer.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.667
I thought I'd celebrate.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.753
Can I get you anything?

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
Yeah, let me get a coffee, black.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.636
That guy that saw John dump the bike,
I read his statement.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.721
He works days, for one.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.098
He just happens
to be there at midnight...

14:10.225 --> 14:12.392
Yeah, I know. He's a shit witness,

14:12.477 --> 14:14.853
but he said what we needed
to get a warrant.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.943
Turn up the heat.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.614
We found blood under John Keene's bed.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.866
What?

14:27.951 --> 14:29.826
Yeah. His girlfriend gave him up.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.037
Something about the women around here.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.582
Yeah. They'll climb over anybody
to get their name in print.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.878
God forbid you should be ordinary,
nobody pays you any mind.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.799
But, once we get
the forensics on the blood,

14:44.509 --> 14:46.385
we're done here. Case closed.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.430
What do you know about
how Marian Crellin died?

14:52.183 --> 14:54.726
Now you're just falling prey
to what this town does best, son.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.728
Ugly gossip.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.730
Well, the nurse that treated her
feels differently.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.069
Is that the same nurse
that got fired for malpractice?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.114
Ended up working in a methadone clinic
'cause she liked methadone so much?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.365
You talking about that nurse?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.117
Ugly gossip.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.747
Seems to me like your priorities
are a little confused, son.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.458
You wanna help me find
John Keene, that's fine.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.876
If not, you can go home.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.920
It's your choice.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.347
Two bourbons. Dos. Double.

16:55.890 --> 16:56.973
Por favor.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.405
Gracias.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.247
Here you go.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.423
What are you doing here?

17:29.841 --> 17:31.133
What are you doing here?

17:31.801 --> 17:34.302
Thought I'd come have
one last drink or two

17:34.387 --> 17:35.470
before I get arrested.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.764
Can't go back to Ashley's.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.599
Sure as shit
not going back to my house.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.936
Rather go into the fucking woods
and kill myself.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.775
Thanks.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.068
I don't blame you.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.613
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.747
So, here I am.

18:05.710 --> 18:09.171
You know, people think I did it
just because I cry about it.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.464
Well, you're a guy.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.717
Guys aren't allowed
to have soft emotions.

18:16.721 --> 18:21.892
Well, my mom got me this book,
when Natalie died,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.311
about how guys deal
with death and stuff...

18:25.521 --> 18:27.564
...and it said
denial was good for men,

18:27.648 --> 18:29.191
so I pretended I didn't care about it,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.028
and that lasted about an hour.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.447
So...

18:35.531 --> 18:36.615
Drinking helps more.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.200
Yeah.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.037
It's like they took
the two girls in Wind Gap

18:42.205 --> 18:43.538
with minds of their own, and they...

18:44.165 --> 18:45.749
They just killed them off.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.003
Do you think our sisters
would have been friends?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.463
Marian, I mean.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.631
Hell no.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.219
So what? Your dead sister's
too good for my dead sister?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.012
-You know.
-Whatever.

19:01.516 --> 19:05.143
John, tell me something.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.646
Did you kill 'em?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.316
'Cause you... You never said
you didn't.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.152
You said, "Nobody thinks
I killed my sister."

19:17.615 --> 19:19.032
But now's your chance.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.243
Tell your story. Defend yourself.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.119
I'm done with that.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.706
I want it over.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.125
Then say the words.
"I didn't kill my sister."

19:29.627 --> 19:31.086
You just want a story...

19:31.170 --> 19:34.047
Hey, you killin' little girls
is what I'm supposed to want.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.717
Something tells me
you got another story.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.178
No.

19:40.763 --> 19:41.805
All right. Okay.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.558
So, why kill Natalie?

19:45.434 --> 19:46.601
I mean, Ann, I understand.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.520
She was a nasty little cunt.
She hurt your sister.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.813
I might have done the same thing,

19:49.897 --> 19:51.606
but Natalie?
Feeling the windpipe snap...

19:51.691 --> 19:54.025
She couldn't scratch me
because she always bit her nails.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.151
That's right.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.319
The teeth were easy.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.572
We had tools at the hog farm.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.241
Pull the pig teeth out
so they can't bite you.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.869
Feels good when they come out.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.871
The release.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.206
Why kill little girls?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.209
I want to rape them,
but I won't let myself,

20:11.294 --> 20:13.086
because I can't control the desire,

20:14.338 --> 20:16.047
so I kill them instead.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.507
Destroy the desire.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.593
I thought Ann would be enough for me,

20:19.677 --> 20:23.013
but it was Natalie
that I really wanted.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.974
See, I can tell stories, too.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.145
Use that one if you like.
I truly don't give a shit.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.483
Or how about this one?

20:37.445 --> 20:40.238
A brother misses his sister
so bad that he...

20:42.575 --> 20:44.034
He wants to die.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.581
But that's boring as shit, right?
So, spin another.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.754
You don't come back from this?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.555
Her fingernails were painted.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.643
When they found her, someone...

21:10.436 --> 21:13.229
Someone painted her fingernails.
Natalie would never do that.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.611
You're kidding me.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.323
Feminist folk singers
for a bunch of pig slaughterers.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.124
I didn't kill Natalie.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.294
I know.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.967
You're beautiful.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.138
I'm sorry. That, just...

21:48.224 --> 21:50.350
It's a compliment, all right?
Don't get any ideas.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.103
So are you.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.991
Either I drive myself
into the station,

22:06.075 --> 22:08.118
or I drive straight into a lake.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.036
Stop.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.455
Okay, you cannot go into
an interrogation like this.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.083
They'd eat you alive.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.961
I don't care if they arrest me.
I don't care if they execute me.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.798
I was dead the minute it happened.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.133
No, you're not.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.303
You are too.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.516
Fuck you.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.354
Go ahead, Camille.
Prove you're not dead.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.585
Thank you.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.900
What's a G-tube?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.403
It's a feeding tube.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.032
It's inserted through the tummy
when the patients can't eat,

23:29.617 --> 23:32.077
so Mom could put food
right into the stomach.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.334
Jesus Christ.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.062
Suspect has been located

23:59.146 --> 24:00.230
at the El Camino Motel

24:00.314 --> 24:02.357
15 miles north of your position.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.640
Girls,
please don't knock so loudly.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.893
Sorry, Mrs. Crellin. Is Amma here?

24:39.562 --> 24:40.854
Amma is under the weather.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.313
What is this concerning?

24:42.398 --> 24:44.274
We just wanted to tell her
about John Keene.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.733
They're about to arrest him, ma'am.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.944
Well, I'm sure we're all happy
to see justice done.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.738
Amma will be relieved.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.491
And please don't
come back again today.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.785
Bitch.

25:34.867 --> 25:40.205
What do you think I'll be, Mama,
when I... When I grow up?

25:40.331 --> 25:42.540
Do you think I'll have kids?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.292
I don't know.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.294
How would I know?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.087
It's years off.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.255
-Do you think...
-Years.

25:49.340 --> 25:50.506
...I won't grow up?

25:52.843 --> 25:55.011
Is that why you want me
to stay little?

25:57.848 --> 25:59.515
So I won't be like Marian?

26:00.559 --> 26:01.601
You are like Marian.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.229
No. I'm not as good.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.107
You can never be as good
as someone dead.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.901
Hush, hush.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.445
That's fever-talk.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.870
Just a little.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.373
Good girl.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.671
I'll be back in a little.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.382
You rest, and let me
have your cellphone.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.969
The other one.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.062
Camille leaves tomorrow,

26:46.897 --> 26:49.315
and things will go back
to the way they were.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.818
I like Camille here.

26:59.702 --> 27:02.203
Why don't you just drink some
water and sleep it off, all right?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.789
Thank you.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.547
I saw this the other day.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.429
Can I look?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.812
It's okay, Camille.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.024
Let me see.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.658
John, nobody sees.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.911
I do.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.758
Hey. It's okay, Camille.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.302
Let me see you.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.933
Let me see you.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.353
It's okay.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.260
Is it everywhere?

28:57.778 --> 28:59.404
"Laid.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.493
"Drained."

29:09.081 --> 29:10.206
"Cherry."

29:11.583 --> 29:13.793
"Sick".

29:15.254 --> 29:16.295
"Gone."

29:17.798 --> 29:18.840
You're reading me.

29:22.845 --> 29:23.886
"Wrong."

29:26.849 --> 29:28.683
"Falling".

29:33.147 --> 29:34.188
"Wicked."

30:21.904 --> 30:22.945
It's okay.

30:39.463 --> 30:40.671
It's okay.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.040
How bad?

31:16.708 --> 31:17.875
Very bad.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.377
Poor thing.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.380
All right, then.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.341
Go relax.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.219
Play some music.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.330
Your sister do that?

34:06.336 --> 34:07.670
I never thought she was bad.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.382
She was just completely herself.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.469
Town hated her for that.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.265
Well, what was with the biting?

34:20.684 --> 34:22.727
-She an animal?
-Fuck yeah, she bit people.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.438
Self-defense. This fucking place...

34:26.481 --> 34:27.940
Yeah.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.570
The only person that ever
gave a shit about my sister

34:33.822 --> 34:34.864
was your mom.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.706
I know she knew Natalie

34:44.499 --> 34:45.624
and Ann, too, right?

34:45.709 --> 34:46.876
The lost girls.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.963
The ones everybody else gave up on.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.009
She just kept coming back for more.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.180
Natalie fought her and fought her,
like physically.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.473
Did she win?

35:00.557 --> 35:02.016
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.976
Yeah. She had to get stitches
one time.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.979
That was from Ann, though,
not from Natalie.

35:08.190 --> 35:12.193
But she, She never gave up.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.361
Yeah, like she was gonna...

35:15.947 --> 35:17.031
Solve them.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.370
I never let her solve me.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.753
Maybe I should've...

35:41.640 --> 35:42.681
What's wrong?

35:46.019 --> 35:47.144
John Keene, you in there?

35:47.229 --> 35:48.562
Yeah. One second!

35:48.647 --> 35:49.772
Come on out, son.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.529
Jesus Christ. Put your pants on, son.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.948
Come on. Get your pants on.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.700
Face the wall.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.827
Put your hands behind your back,

36:02.911 --> 36:04.870
interlock your fingers,
spread your legs, don't move.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.750
-You of age, son?
-Yeah, I'm 18.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.170
All right, John Keene,
you're under arrest.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.256
You have the right to remain silent.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.217
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.718
You have a right to an attorney.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.762
If you can't afford one,

36:21.847 --> 36:24.223
we'll try to rustle one up for you.
Mike, grab those clothes.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.642
You understand your rights, son?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.893
-Yeah.
-All right.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.229
-You got him?
-I got him.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.152
We'll give you a minute
to gather your things, Miss Preaker.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.504
Where do you want to begin?

36:58.717 --> 37:02.094
It's just... It's not how it looks.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.805
I mean, I know
that sounds cliche, but...

37:04.890 --> 37:07.141
This room fucking stinks of you.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.602
Believe me, I know the smell.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.234
He just wanted to have a few...

37:18.069 --> 37:20.696
Get a little liquid courage
before he got arrested.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.575
I thought maybe I could
get a quote or two,

37:24.701 --> 37:28.704
and then he wanted me to
bring him back here to sleep it off.

37:34.336 --> 37:35.794
He didn't do it, Richard.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.464
Is that what you discussed
when he had his dick in you?

37:38.840 --> 37:40.007
Look, you know that he didn't...

37:40.091 --> 37:41.258
Fuck you?

37:44.054 --> 37:45.262
Kill them.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.807
They found Natalie's blood
where he's been living.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.978
Yeah. You and I have been
jerking each other off, haven't we?

37:53.772 --> 37:55.773
It's so kinky,
there's more to the story.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.442
Back on Earth,
it's the family, Camille.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.402
It's always the fucking family.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.739
Man, I should have fucked
the prime suspect.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.742
Don't... Don't do...

38:06.868 --> 38:07.952
I should have fucked him.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.412
I would have cracked
this fucker weeks ago.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.915
We both lost

38:14.292 --> 38:17.378
people, Richard, and...

38:17.462 --> 38:19.505
What comfort you must've been
to each other.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.631
That's...

38:21.341 --> 38:23.342
You know what I've been doing
for the last 24 hours?

38:23.468 --> 38:25.552
Do you now? I've been
studying you, Camille.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.973
Yeah, I've been studying you
because you're so fucking fascinating.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.016
Who is she? What is she hiding?

38:31.101 --> 38:33.727
You know, you really had me there,
but whatever happened, I'm done.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.271
Richard, don't...
Please don't go. Please.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.856
Please don't hate me, okay?

38:38.274 --> 38:39.733
Please. Please don't hate me.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.485
Stop. Stop.
What are you doing? Get up!

38:41.695 --> 38:43.821
Please...

38:45.949 --> 38:48.200
I don't think you're bad, okay.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.955
I think one bad thing happened,

38:53.039 --> 38:55.582
and you blamed the rest
of your shitty life on it.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.422
People really buy it, your sad story.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.176
But, really, you're just
a drunk and a slut.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.236
Chief, what do you wanna do
about the girl?

39:25.613 --> 39:28.532
-Just leave her be.
-All right.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.118
Dispatch, we've got
the suspect in custody.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.621
Well, look at what the cat dragged in.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.331
Come on in.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.879
It's so nice of you to drop by.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.340
I'll make you something to drink.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.510
You look like you could use it.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.011
All right.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.513
Sit down.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.182
Let me turn this crap off.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.728
This is how I do 'em.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.650
Just enough Stoli
to make the stomach bleed.

41:30.155 --> 41:34.867
Darling. Woman-to-woman,
you look like pure-T blue ribbon shit.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.202
Believe me, I know that look.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.997
I own that look.

41:42.625 --> 41:46.086
My husband gave me
this ugly-ass thing.

41:47.881 --> 41:50.674
I keep my beauty secrets inside.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.595
Go on. Help yourself there.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.138
I got plenty.

41:56.472 --> 42:00.601
I got endometriosis,
pelvic floor dysfunction,

42:01.603 --> 42:05.898
I got cysts, IC, IBS,

42:05.982 --> 42:08.233
and fibromyalgia.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.989
And hypochondria!

42:14.616 --> 42:18.744
I've been diagnosed and undiagnosed,
rediagnosed with all of it.

42:20.914 --> 42:23.790
I hurt is all.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.587
Jackie...

42:30.423 --> 42:32.090
You've always been
really nice to me.

42:32.175 --> 42:33.383
Always.

42:36.846 --> 42:39.932
I read Marian's medical file.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.017
Your name is all over those records.

42:42.268 --> 42:46.480
Information requested, explanations,
every test, every diagnosis.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.940
-Information...
-Yep.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.274
Requested.

42:50.026 --> 42:51.568
All denied.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.613
What were you looking for?

42:57.033 --> 42:58.075
What do you...

42:58.910 --> 43:01.787
What do you remember
about her funeral that day?

43:06.501 --> 43:07.918
Just looking at her... Marian, mostly.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.212
Just looking at her.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.131
In that beautiful dress of hers.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.300
That tiny little body,

43:15.385 --> 43:16.635
all the stories it could tell...

43:17.262 --> 43:18.470
Gone.

43:21.391 --> 43:22.432
Drink with me.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.309
Let me host you for a little while.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.520
There you go.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.315
See how easy that was?

43:30.692 --> 43:31.858
Anyway, it was gorgeous.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.778
Goddamn Martha Stewart funeral.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.863
Marian looked like an angel.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.491
Your mother never looked
more beautiful than that day.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.410
She cried and cried...

43:44.789 --> 43:46.206
...and then she burned her.

43:48.001 --> 43:49.042
What?

43:49.585 --> 43:50.627
Cremated.

43:52.714 --> 43:56.133
They simply loved
your mama at Woodberry!

43:56.217 --> 43:58.844
Those nurses would line up
like chorus girls

43:58.928 --> 44:01.972
whenever she'd come
promenading into that ICU.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.140
She'd always bring sweets.

44:05.685 --> 44:07.811
Imagine that.
The mother of a sick child,

44:07.895 --> 44:11.356
and she'd still come
to bake for the staff.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.191
Goddamn Mother of the Year.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.278
Drink up, doll.

44:16.738 --> 44:18.530
Drink up.

44:22.118 --> 44:24.995
You don't like my bloodies?

44:29.083 --> 44:30.834
That's 'cause they're shitty.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.336
I know.

44:33.046 --> 44:36.256
But every time I ask you to drink it,

44:37.550 --> 44:38.592
you do.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.260
Why is that?

44:43.181 --> 44:44.389
It's easier.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.475
Easier...

44:48.561 --> 44:49.603
For Marian.

44:50.772 --> 44:52.105
You made it hard.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.400
Hard on yourself, hard on Adora.

44:57.070 --> 44:58.653
Marian, it was easier.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.949
Just lie back and...

45:04.827 --> 45:05.869
...take it.

45:07.497 --> 45:08.872
And you knew?

45:11.542 --> 45:12.709
And you just let it happen?

45:12.794 --> 45:15.087
Well, what was I gonna do?
Who was I gonna tell?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.214
Who the fuck's gonna believe me?

45:19.717 --> 45:21.009
Well, no wonder you're sick.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.469
I did what I could.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.680
-You're sick.
-Don't you walk out of here.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.183
You come back here.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.520
God damn it! I did what I could!

45:36.567 --> 45:37.984
Hi, honey. How are you?

45:38.403 --> 45:39.861
Hi, Eileen. Can I, um...

45:42.907 --> 45:44.032
Can I talk to Curry?

45:44.575 --> 45:46.076
Sweetheart,
what is it? Are you okay?

45:48.913 --> 45:49.996
I just really...

45:51.749 --> 45:53.041
Sweetie, you're scaring me.

45:56.963 --> 45:59.548
You're not hurting yourself, are you?

46:00.716 --> 46:02.676
No, no, no. I just...

46:06.722 --> 46:08.181
No, I just...

46:09.976 --> 46:11.017
No.

46:12.228 --> 46:14.104
Honey, honey, Something's wrong.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.607
Camille, what's going on?

46:17.859 --> 46:20.277
I just... My mother...

46:20.445 --> 46:21.736
Come on, Cubby. Talk to me.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.282
My mother did it. My mother did it.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.619
Camille, listen to me.
You're under a lot of stress.

46:29.704 --> 46:31.746
I was very wrong
to send you down there.

46:31.998 --> 46:34.416
What I need you to do now
is go to the nearest airport

46:34.792 --> 46:36.126
and fly back home here.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.252
No.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.171
Charge the ticket.
I'll pay you back when you get here,

46:39.255 --> 46:41.465
but I really need you
to get home now, Camille.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.757
You understand?

46:44.552 --> 46:45.635
No.

46:48.473 --> 46:49.723
She's doing it again,

46:51.142 --> 46:52.559
and I need to take care of it.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.352
No, Camille...

46:54.437 --> 46:55.479
Camille?

46:55.980 --> 46:57.022
Shit.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.009
Get it all out.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.637
Good girl.

47:31.224 --> 47:32.766
Good girl.

47:53.955 --> 47:55.789
God has given me
another sick baby.

48:25.027 --> 48:27.028
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, Chief.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.739
So, the streets are safe
to skate on again?

48:29.824 --> 48:33.076
Well, as I recall, safe or not,
doesn't stop you girls.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.661
What's gonna happen to John?

48:35.413 --> 48:36.538
It's up to the system.

48:37.123 --> 48:38.582
Where's your other roller pal?

48:38.708 --> 48:40.041
Don't you three travel in a pack?

48:40.501 --> 48:41.960
Her mama wouldn't let her come out.

48:42.336 --> 48:44.671
- She's sick.
- Well, word of advice.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.006
You keep your eyes open.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.133
Some drunk comes
flying down this road,

48:48.217 --> 48:49.801
he'll hit you before he sees you.

48:49.969 --> 48:52.721
Or she. Don't be sexist, Chief.

49:12.533 --> 49:13.658
Sick.
