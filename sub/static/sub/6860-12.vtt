Stranded!

00:17.274 --> 00:19.241
On a secret mission for the Republic,

00:19.276 --> 00:22.111
Colonel Gascon
and his intrepid droid squad

00:22.145 --> 00:24.247
successfully steal an encryption module

00:24.281 --> 00:26.015
from a Separatist ship.

00:26.050 --> 00:28.384
During their escape, our heroes crash

00:28.419 --> 00:30.453
on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar

00:30.488 --> 00:33.090
and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland

00:33.124 --> 00:35.125
called The Void.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.495
Now, after surviving against all odds,

00:37.529 --> 00:39.797
our heroes must find a way home

00:39.831 --> 00:41.532
and deliver the encryption module

00:41.567 --> 00:45.336
to crack the Separatist code
and stop an enemy attack.

00:45.371 --> 00:47.405
[R2-D2 whistles]

00:47.439 --> 00:49.674
I have never been to Tatooine,

00:49.708 --> 00:51.942
but if this place
reminds you of it, Artoo,

00:51.977 --> 00:54.178
remind me never to go there.

00:59.317 --> 01:01.151
Don't be absurd, Qutee.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.186
These people aren't dangerous.

01:06.624 --> 01:10.326
[indistinct muttering]

01:10.361 --> 01:13.396
[Qutee blips]

01:13.430 --> 01:15.965
Most of these people are probably hiding

01:15.999 --> 01:18.667
from someone or something.

01:18.701 --> 01:21.736
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

01:21.771 --> 01:23.471
Nobody's here by choice,

01:23.505 --> 01:25.339
which goes double for me.

01:25.373 --> 01:26.740
I hope you have a plan

01:26.775 --> 01:29.242
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

01:29.277 --> 01:31.678
Of course I do, Corporal.

01:31.712 --> 01:34.347
All we need is a communications uplink

01:34.381 --> 01:35.348
and some fuel.

01:35.382 --> 01:36.883
[Ceefor pings]

01:36.917 --> 01:39.151
Thank you for the reminder, Ceefor,

01:39.186 --> 01:42.554
but I'm well aware our shuttle's
lost in The Void.

01:42.588 --> 01:45.091
I'm talking about fuel for me.

01:45.125 --> 01:48.160
You droids can putter along
on battery power

01:48.194 --> 01:50.696
but I need food to survive.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.499
My power cells are running low too,

01:53.534 --> 01:55.802
and an oil bath would be nice.

01:55.836 --> 01:59.305
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

[Beezee warbles]

02:00.340 --> 02:01.674
Forget it, Beezee.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.643
We're not on vacation here.

02:03.678 --> 02:06.647
Artoo, is the encryption module safe?

02:06.681 --> 02:08.382
[R2-D2 bleeps]

02:08.417 --> 02:10.952
Nothing short of death or dismemberment

02:10.985 --> 02:13.154
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

02:13.189 --> 02:16.324
from delivering
that module to Coruscant.

02:20.163 --> 02:22.397
Well, I'll be.

02:22.432 --> 02:24.900
A diner.
A place of eating.

02:24.935 --> 02:27.002
[chuckles] I'm saved.

02:27.037 --> 02:29.772
Artoo, you and the other 'mechs
scout the perimeter.

02:29.806 --> 02:32.808
Find out if there
are any unfriendlies around.

02:32.876 --> 02:38.147
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

02:43.653 --> 02:46.622

02:52.963 --> 02:54.263
Good day.

02:57.801 --> 03:02.472
I am Colonel Gascon of
the Grand Army of the Republic.

03:02.506 --> 03:05.442
And I am here
on very important business.

03:11.716 --> 03:14.551
I don't have much time,
so if you'll be so kind

03:14.586 --> 03:18.656
as to fix me your daily special
and let my droid recharge.

03:18.690 --> 03:22.259
No droids.

03:22.294 --> 03:24.695
Fine.

03:24.729 --> 03:27.098
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

03:27.132 --> 03:30.135
We don't serve your type either.

03:30.169 --> 03:33.205
What <i>type</i> are you referring to?

03:33.239 --> 03:36.175
Conduit worms.

03:39.213 --> 03:42.849
I beg your pardon.
I am a Zilkan.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.686
You'll be begging for your life

03:45.720 --> 03:47.487
if you don't beat it.

03:47.555 --> 03:49.957
[sputtering]

03:49.991 --> 03:51.993
Beat it.

03:52.027 --> 03:52.993
Uh-oh.

03:53.028 --> 03:54.028
Ah!

03:54.062 --> 03:56.931
Oh, ah!

03:56.965 --> 03:59.333
This is an outrage.

03:59.368 --> 04:01.769
That monstrosity will rue the day

04:01.803 --> 04:03.771
he denied me a meal.

04:03.839 --> 04:05.840
I would not push it, Colonel.

04:05.874 --> 04:08.776
That monstrosity
might make a meal out of you.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.144
[sighs] I don't care.

04:10.178 --> 04:11.746
I'm famished.

04:17.452 --> 04:20.120
I think I can help.

hydrospanner,

04:38.308 --> 04:39.608
that's no meal.

04:39.676 --> 04:41.610
That is garbage.

04:41.678 --> 04:42.945
What is the difference?

04:42.979 --> 04:44.446
It is edible, is it not?

Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.082
I didn't see you there.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.784
Look, I could get you some food,

05:18.818 --> 05:21.921
but normally people
come in the front door.

05:21.955 --> 05:25.058
But there's no problem.

05:25.092 --> 05:28.361
You do know that
you're eating garbage, right?

05:30.165 --> 05:32.333
You're a clone.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.668
Excuse me?

05:33.702 --> 05:35.704
Uh, I--

05:35.738 --> 05:36.738
I wouldn't know about that.

05:36.806 --> 05:38.440
My--my name's Gregor.

05:38.475 --> 05:40.976
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

05:47.917 --> 05:49.284
You are a clone.

05:49.318 --> 05:51.952
[laughs] Are you working undercover?

05:51.987 --> 05:54.922
I don't know what you're talking about.

Listen to me, soldier,
whatever your assignment is,

05:57.492 --> 05:59.492
it can't be more important than mine.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.261
It is his first real mission.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.929
He is just a map reader.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.465
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

06:05.499 --> 06:09.101
You are a clone and a soldier
in the Republic Army,

06:09.136 --> 06:11.737
and I order you to take me to your ship.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.440
We need to get back to Coruscant
immediately.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.410
Uh, look, friend,
I was just trying to help.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.445
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

06:19.479 --> 06:20.779
I do not think that soldier

06:20.814 --> 06:24.383
believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.718
Gregor!

06:25.752 --> 06:27.987
Get back to work.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.289
Uh, excuse me.
I got to go.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.558
I don't want to lose my job.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.830

So, uh, boss,

07:07.894 --> 07:09.595
you know, I was just wondering...

07:09.629 --> 07:12.697
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.832
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.867
I don't want a raise, sir.

07:15.902 --> 07:19.738
I-I just wanted to know,
what's a clone?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.508
Someone told me I was a clone today.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.609
They insisted.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.810
Heh.
A clone?

07:24.844 --> 07:25.911
[laughs]

07:25.945 --> 07:29.247
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.417
They are brave soldiers.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.786
Does that sound like you?

07:34.820 --> 07:37.288
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

07:37.323 --> 07:40.992
Forget about clones
or anything like that.

07:41.026 --> 07:43.194
You have good life here,

07:43.228 --> 07:45.096
a simple life.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.664
More than you had when Borkus found you.

07:47.699 --> 07:48.966
I know, sir.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.367
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

07:50.401 --> 07:51.367
Believe me.

07:51.402 --> 07:53.637
But I thought
maybe you could--

07:53.671 --> 07:56.039
could you tell me, how did I get here?

07:56.073 --> 07:57.207
Where did you find me?

07:57.241 --> 07:58.608
Enough questions.

07:58.642 --> 07:59.876
Go home. Sleep.

07:59.910 --> 08:03.246
Come back tomorrow.
Do your job.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.549
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again,

08:06.584 --> 08:07.984
understand?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.616
I cannot help noticing

08:22.739 --> 08:25.434
that we are already on our third plan.

08:25.916 --> 08:30.853
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

08:30.887 --> 08:32.921
something droids are not known for.

08:32.956 --> 08:35.123
[R2-D2 beeps]

08:35.158 --> 08:36.457
Artoo is right.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.926
Droids are not known for being flexible,

08:38.961 --> 08:41.929
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

08:41.962 --> 08:43.998
Well, answer me this, Corporal,

08:44.032 --> 08:46.834
if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

08:46.868 --> 08:49.236
were better prepared
to lead this mission,

08:49.270 --> 08:51.939
then why did they put me in charge?

08:51.973 --> 08:54.875
'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside Beezee.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.582
No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

09:00.616 --> 09:03.852
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

09:03.887 --> 09:06.589
then there must be a landing zone nearby

09:06.623 --> 09:10.426
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

09:10.460 --> 09:14.797
That, Corporal, is why I am in charge.

09:17.001 --> 09:21.037
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

09:21.072 --> 09:23.039
just like we did on the dreadnought,

09:23.074 --> 09:26.442
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

09:26.476 --> 09:28.811
[droids warbling]

09:28.845 --> 09:30.279
The 'mechs have a point, Colonel.

09:30.313 --> 09:31.914
After what we did on the dreadnought,

09:31.948 --> 09:35.050
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

09:35.084 --> 09:37.886
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.555
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

09:40.589 --> 09:42.290
But there's no way in Malachor

09:42.324 --> 09:45.159
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

09:45.193 --> 09:47.761
on an assault of that landing zone.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.363
What is the plan now, Colonel?

09:49.397 --> 09:53.433
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

09:53.468 --> 09:57.471
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.037
[R2-D2 clicks]

10:50.324 --> 10:51.691
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

10:51.725 --> 10:53.125
Agh! What?

10:59.399 --> 11:01.099
I...

11:01.133 --> 11:02.667
I don't understand.

11:02.701 --> 11:04.935
That's me?

11:04.970 --> 11:07.037
No, that's Captain Rex.

11:07.072 --> 11:09.706
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

11:09.741 --> 11:11.875
just like you, Gregor.

11:11.909 --> 11:15.578
I can't believe it.

11:15.613 --> 11:17.213
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

11:17.247 --> 11:21.785
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

11:21.819 --> 11:24.721
Millions.
A whole army's worth.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.456
Uh-huh.

11:26.491 --> 11:29.793
And they all look exactly like me?

11:29.828 --> 11:33.296
No, those clones are warriors,

11:33.330 --> 11:36.332
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

11:36.367 --> 11:39.602
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

11:39.637 --> 11:42.038
in our war against the Separatists.

11:42.072 --> 11:43.406
They're not dishwashers

11:43.440 --> 11:46.809
living in
some vermin-infested hovel.

11:46.843 --> 11:48.578
[droids bleeping]

11:48.612 --> 11:51.748
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

11:51.782 --> 11:54.784
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

11:54.818 --> 11:56.685
so he pays the difference for me.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.387
Don't you get it, Gregor?

11:58.422 --> 11:59.889
You're his slave.

11:59.923 --> 12:02.091
We need to figure out
who you really are,

12:02.159 --> 12:03.693
how you got here.

12:03.728 --> 12:06.796
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

12:06.831 --> 12:12.903
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

12:12.937 --> 12:15.105
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

12:15.139 --> 12:19.376
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

12:19.443 --> 12:20.643
Hmm.

12:20.678 --> 12:24.180
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

12:24.214 --> 12:26.849
Your military records
will be in the database.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.284
Scan him, Artoo.

12:28.319 --> 12:29.719
[R2-D2 chirps]

12:35.493 --> 12:37.462
Impressive.

12:37.496 --> 12:43.168
Gregor, your designation
is CC-5576-39.

12:43.202 --> 12:47.706
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

12:47.741 --> 12:50.009
A clone commando.

12:50.043 --> 12:51.878
[R2-D2 whistling]

12:51.912 --> 12:53.679
Your file says you were reported

12:53.714 --> 12:56.215
missing in action during

12:56.283 --> 12:58.050
the Battle of Sarrish.

12:58.085 --> 12:59.385
[all beep and groan]

12:59.419 --> 13:01.854
Sarrish?

13:01.922 --> 13:03.856
Sarrish.

13:03.890 --> 13:05.958
Wait.

13:05.992 --> 13:08.193
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

13:08.228 --> 13:12.097
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

13:12.132 --> 13:14.466
[sighs] Sarrish.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.135
Yes.

13:16.169 --> 13:18.137
Yes, I remember now.

13:18.204 --> 13:20.606
So many soldiers were dying.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.010
Dodo you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.113
No.

13:27.147 --> 13:31.418
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

13:31.452 --> 13:33.920
Bodies everywhere.

13:33.955 --> 13:35.822
I knew I had to get help.

13:35.857 --> 13:39.026
But that's where the memory stops.

13:39.061 --> 13:40.361
Well, soldier,

13:40.396 --> 13:43.664
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

13:43.699 --> 13:44.799
but you can help us.

13:44.833 --> 13:45.800
[Ceefor pings]

13:45.835 --> 13:47.769
Our mission depends on it.

13:54.811 --> 13:58.213
Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

13:58.247 --> 13:59.948
but it has been six.

13:59.983 --> 14:02.251
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

14:02.285 --> 14:03.753
Then I'll go back in there

14:03.787 --> 14:06.456
and personally
knock some sense into him.

14:06.490 --> 14:07.457
That won't be necessary.

14:07.491 --> 14:08.658
Whoa!

14:08.692 --> 14:10.059
[droid whistles]

14:10.094 --> 14:12.028
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

14:12.062 --> 14:14.130
might bring back some more memories,

14:14.164 --> 14:16.332
until we recover my equipment anyway.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.535
I overheard you guys talking.

14:18.569 --> 14:20.803
I think I know where my armor is.

14:20.838 --> 14:22.238
Let's go check out the diner.

14:31.615 --> 14:34.284
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

14:34.318 --> 14:36.252
We do not have all night.

14:39.523 --> 14:41.157
Looking for this?

14:46.196 --> 14:49.964
My uniform.
My equipment.

14:49.999 --> 14:53.034
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.035
Why?

14:54.070 --> 14:57.205
I don't care who you were.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.107
You are dishwasher now.

14:59.142 --> 15:03.213
And you owe me for saving you
from your crash.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.816
Your life is mine, Gregor.

15:05.850 --> 15:07.584
You didn't save me.

15:07.618 --> 15:09.619
You turned me into a slave.

15:09.654 --> 15:12.122
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

15:12.156 --> 15:14.057
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

15:14.092 --> 15:15.659
I want my life back.

15:15.727 --> 15:18.028
You want your freedom, Gregor?

15:18.062 --> 15:20.297
Take your gun from me.

15:20.365 --> 15:22.666
Show me you are a soldier.

15:22.733 --> 15:23.833
[grunting]

15:23.868 --> 15:25.168
You see?

15:25.202 --> 15:27.470
You are no soldier.

15:27.505 --> 15:29.572
You are a dishwasher.

15:29.607 --> 15:30.573
[laughing]

15:30.608 --> 15:31.841
[R2-D2 beeps]

15:35.379 --> 15:36.346
[groaning]

15:36.380 --> 15:38.114
[droids warbling]

15:38.148 --> 15:40.984
Why, you no-good droids.

15:41.018 --> 15:44.220
Let go of me.

15:44.255 --> 15:45.489
Agh! Oh.

15:45.523 --> 15:46.489
[R2-D2 chirping]

15:46.524 --> 15:47.957
Agh!

15:47.992 --> 15:49.959
Take your things, Gregor.

15:49.993 --> 15:51.361
We're getting out of here.

15:54.065 --> 15:55.765
Don't leave, Gregor.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.067
It's a big galaxy out there,

15:58.102 --> 15:59.569
bigger than you know.

15:59.604 --> 16:02.572
Stay here, where your life is simple.

16:02.607 --> 16:05.175
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

16:05.209 --> 16:06.843
Not for this clone.

16:06.877 --> 16:07.844
Ha!

16:07.878 --> 16:10.413
You will never get off Abafar,

16:10.481 --> 16:13.817
you and your little Republic friends,

16:13.851 --> 16:17.187
not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

16:17.221 --> 16:19.356
What are you talking about?

16:19.390 --> 16:23.661
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

16:23.695 --> 16:25.663
They are mining our Rhydonium

16:25.697 --> 16:28.933
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

16:31.336 --> 16:33.170
You will see.

16:33.205 --> 16:35.572
You will all be stuck here

16:35.607 --> 16:39.343
begging Borkus for a job in his diner.

16:39.377 --> 16:42.379
[laughing]

17:02.510 --> 17:05.279
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

17:05.347 --> 17:06.347
Gregor.

17:12.487 --> 17:14.119
Wait.
There.

17:14.155 --> 17:16.356
There's a cruiser up there.

17:16.390 --> 17:17.991
And that shuttle, I think--

17:18.025 --> 17:21.827
Yes, it's being loaded up
with Rhydonium canisters.

17:24.231 --> 17:25.198
Huh.

17:25.232 --> 17:26.366
I guess Mr. Borkus

17:26.400 --> 17:29.001
was actually telling
the truth...for once.

17:29.036 --> 17:31.302
What exactly is Rhydonium?

17:31.336 --> 17:32.736
It's a fuel.

17:32.771 --> 17:35.005
Mostly been mined out on Abafar.

17:35.039 --> 17:36.706
It's volatile and dangerous.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.874
[R2-D2 beeping]

17:38.909 --> 17:41.709
Yes, we do have a new mission:

17:41.744 --> 17:45.446
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.214
I'll cover you
and clear the way, Colonel.

17:47.248 --> 17:48.748
You all head straight to the shuttle.

17:48.816 --> 17:50.550
I'll take care of those clankers.

17:50.584 --> 17:53.252
Hmm, sounds like a good plan.

17:53.287 --> 17:55.988
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

17:56.022 --> 17:58.923
[droids warbling]

18:00.459 --> 18:02.759
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

18:02.793 --> 18:04.727
Let's roll.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.834
Hey!

18:15.103 --> 18:18.739
You need authorization
to enter this area.

18:18.773 --> 18:19.740
Agh!

18:21.943 --> 18:22.909
Get them!

18:24.945 --> 18:26.079
Agh!

18:35.622 --> 18:37.789
[blaster firing]

18:37.823 --> 18:39.090
[R2-D2 bleeps]

18:40.893 --> 18:42.627
Good job, Gregor.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.867
Look, he's up there!

18:50.901 --> 18:53.869
[blasters firing]

18:58.107 --> 18:59.074
[explosion]

18:59.108 --> 19:00.675
Just keep moving.

19:00.709 --> 19:01.943
It is all under control.

19:09.251 --> 19:12.586
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

19:16.357 --> 19:18.826
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

19:18.860 --> 19:20.961
Blast them!

19:20.995 --> 19:23.363
They are on to us.

19:23.397 --> 19:25.565
[explosion]

19:25.599 --> 19:27.333
Colonel, can you hear me?

19:27.401 --> 19:29.502
Save yourselves!

19:29.536 --> 19:31.337
Okay.
Whoa!

19:31.371 --> 19:32.338
Agh!

19:32.372 --> 19:34.940
Whoa-oh-oh.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.942
[blasters firing]

19:44.983 --> 19:47.451
Did everybody make it?

19:47.485 --> 19:49.987
No, Beezee and the colonel
are still out there.

19:50.021 --> 19:52.322
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.059
[groans]

19:56.261 --> 19:57.695
Agh!

20:00.431 --> 20:01.698
Colonel, you all right?

20:01.733 --> 20:04.267
I'll never make it back alive.

20:04.302 --> 20:05.703
Yes, you will, sir.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.237
This is what I was born to do.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.006
Now, go before it's too late.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.042
[blasters firing]

20:18.916 --> 20:19.983
[explosion]

20:26.656 --> 20:27.790
[groans]

20:31.827 --> 20:33.695
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

20:33.729 --> 20:36.631
[R2-D2 whistles]

20:36.665 --> 20:37.866
Artoo's right.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.068
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

20:40.103 --> 20:42.771
Don't worry about me.

20:42.805 --> 20:44.706
You made me remember who I am.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.541
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

20:46.576 --> 20:47.709
Now go!

20:47.743 --> 20:51.580
[blasters firing]

20:51.614 --> 20:53.115
Where is Gregor?

20:53.149 --> 20:55.116
Where is Gregor?

20:55.151 --> 20:57.986
He's doing what a soldier does:

20:58.020 --> 21:01.623
sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

21:01.657 --> 21:04.393
[choral music]

21:24.748 --> 21:28.118
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

21:28.152 --> 21:31.989
We will take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

21:32.024 --> 21:35.060
and we will watch for your return.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.029
