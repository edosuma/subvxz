04:27.360 --> 04:30.840
God, Ma, you're such a mom.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.520
You ready?
We're going for a ride.

Hey, girl. Get in here.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.000
Whoa!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.080
-Oh!
-Whoa!

05:23.920 --> 05:25.960
This is fun, right?

05:26.000 --> 05:26.960
Maybe.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.840
Yeah.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.600
-Ooh, careful.
-Hey, l'm driving here.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.840
Whoo!

06:02.320 --> 06:05.720
Mortar's coming!
Mortar's coming in!

06:07.160 --> 06:09.880
Machine gun, right flank!
Machine gun, right flank!

06:24.240 --> 06:26.240
Medic!

06:44.760 --> 06:46.120
That's when you saw them, huh?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.040
Well, it works.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.080
My Spike works.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.520
Okay. Okay.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.480
Easy, easy.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.600
Okay.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.760
-Take it easy.
-Take it easy.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.000
No!

07:33.080 --> 07:34.840
l've got a headache.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.240
Have you got some Wite-Out?

07:37.640 --> 07:40.120
Ma!

07:40.200 --> 07:42.120
Ma!

07:42.160 --> 07:43.880
You don't know

07:43.920 --> 07:45.800
what it is you
got yourself into, bud,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.920
but you're a long way from home.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.160
Oh, but it's so confusing.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.120
Where to go,
where to go... yes...

07:54.160 --> 07:55.400
Ma!

07:55.400 --> 07:56.840
Oh, bother.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.880
What the hell are you?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.680
They're doodles.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.000
Cartoons?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.480
Don't get too close, Doc.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.800
l can't believe what l've done.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.040
My Spike was supposed
to send me to your world,

08:12.040 --> 08:14.200
but instead you're here.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.200
This man's not dangerous
to anyone.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.040
As for us, son, we may not
be real to you as yet...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
...but we will be.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.440
You've come
to a whole new world.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.080
You've done something
extremely rare.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.800
You see,
you're in a real place

08:29.840 --> 08:31.760
called the Cool World.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.799
Hmm.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.000
Oh. How strange.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.440
Say " ah."

08:38.440 --> 08:40.280
Ah.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.799
But when it comes to making
the trip in the body...

08:42.840 --> 08:44.480
Did you hear about the wolf

08:44.520 --> 08:45.920
that built the studio?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.880
-No, not...
-...l've never seen it before.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh!

08:50.040 --> 08:52.600
Oh, my goodness.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.720
l'm sorry about your mother.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.680
You're cartoons.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.120
You're not real.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.040
Oh-ho, we're real, all right.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.400
The possibility
of interworld travel

09:06.440 --> 09:09.920
has been an obsession of mine
for many, many years.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.040
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

09:11.080 --> 09:12.680
Hey, Doc, wait.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.720
This man is not for you.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.880
He's not a police problem.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.000
He's a mystery of science.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.480
And a hero to boot.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.760
l ain't no hero.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.640
Oh, don't be so sure, friend.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.840
With this hole l've opened,

09:24.880 --> 09:26.960
there could be all kinds
of problems. Ha-ha.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.840
They call me Doc Whiskers.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.320
What's your name, son?

09:30.360 --> 09:31.800
l'm Frank Harris.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.480
What did you do
in your world?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.840
l was a soldier.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.480
Oh, you could be useful
here when l'm gone.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.840
Where are you from?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.920
Um, Vegas.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.120
Tomorrow we're out of here.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.880
You're just a drawing, Holli,

10:10.920 --> 10:13.600
but without you,
l'd never have made it.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.000
Oh, you look good tonight, babe.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.160
lt's time you came to me, Jack.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.760
Come to me.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.680
Ooh, baby!

11:21.160 --> 11:22.920
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.
-Hey-ya, hey-ya.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.080
l've been waiting for you,
darlin'

12:36.840 --> 12:38.600
-Huh?
-Hmm?

12:38.640 --> 12:41.040
Uh, Sparky,
uh, whatcha up to, huh?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.600
What makes you think

12:43.640 --> 12:45.920
l'd tell a little punk like you?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.480
Why, he's going soft
for that tomato.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.240
Uh... w-w-what's her name?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.840
H-H-Holli or something. Yeah.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.240
Enough out of you, kitty.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.800
You're too young
to be thinking about girls.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.000
Especially that girl.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.800
Here.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.920
A bunch of wooden nickels.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.480
Don't spend them all
in one place.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.800
W-W-What?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.400
Philip flew the coop
last night.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.560
Hey, Molina! Hey, Molina!

14:05.600 --> 14:07.480
Come over here.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.160
Did you step in it?

14:11.320 --> 14:13.600
Hey, there's
a flower on your head.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.720
There's are lots of...

14:16.880 --> 14:17.840
Hey.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.840
Look out!

14:31.480 --> 14:35.200
l hate it when she meets guys
without tellin' me.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.200
l light up like

14:38.760 --> 14:40.200
Neon

14:40.280 --> 14:44.880
Just a tiny section of your
affection in my direction

14:44.920 --> 14:46.280
Will do

14:46.320 --> 14:47.760
Ooh.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.560
-Detective Harris.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.480
What a pleasure.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.480
l was just rehearsing.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.880
Hello, Holli.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.240
This is an exact replica
of the dress Marilyn Monroe wore

15:10.280 --> 15:11.480
in Let's Make Love.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.400
Oh!

15:13.440 --> 15:15.560
l know that movie by heart.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.720
The girl gets get everything
by the end of it.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.400
Everything she ever wanted.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.640
lt's real.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.720
l mean it.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.880
l even saw
a copyright date on it.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.320
Rumor has it, Holli,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.480
that you had a noid visitation

15:35.520 --> 15:37.520
at the Slash Club last night.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.040
lt was just a mind slip.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.080
Nothin' special.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.880
You're just a regular
true believer

15:45.920 --> 15:47.680
in law and order, huh?

15:49.160 --> 15:50.320
Give me a couple, Jack.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.440
Come on, let's go.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.920
Beat it, copper.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.880
Yeah.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.760
-Go on, beat it.
-Beat it...

15:56.800 --> 15:57.840
Just doing my job.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.000
-Come on let's go.
-Come on.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
Hey, Frank?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.800
Don't go just yet.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.240
Come here.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.880
l got somethin' to show you.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.880
Guess what?

16:17.920 --> 16:20.200
l've seen your little
museum of Vegas.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.360
And don't start in
with your Vegas Vinnie rap.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.440
l've heard it.
lt bores me.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.240
Vegas Vinnie made the Spike--

16:29.280 --> 16:32.920
crossed over and became the
owner of the Union Plaza Hotel.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.240
Vegas Vinnie
is a fairy tale, Would.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.280
Doodle moms tell it to doodle
kids to help them go to sleep.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.280
lt could all be true.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.760
You got over here.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.440
So why couldn't he make it
over there?

16:51.480 --> 16:54.040
Or for that matter,
why couldn't l?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.120
You could help me.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.599
There'll be no crossovers
while l'm around.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.359
l've got news for you, pal.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.960
l am not your ordinary doodle.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.160
l've been checking up

17:18.200 --> 17:19.880
on what these noid dames
have got going

17:19.920 --> 17:22.760
in the real world,
and l want it!

17:22.800 --> 17:23.760
Don't you see?

17:25.079 --> 17:26.400
They're real.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.200
They've got power.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.080
When they touch something,
they feel it.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.440
And when
they taste something...

17:40.520 --> 17:42.320
...they really taste it.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.120
And when they do it
with a man...

17:48.680 --> 17:51.000
...they really do it.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.560
Ooh...

17:54.720 --> 17:55.640
What can l say, sweetheart?

17:55.680 --> 17:58.240
l can't help you out
in that department.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.320
Well, don't you see?

18:01.360 --> 18:03.120
Believe it.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.240
l've had enough.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.120
Oh, yeah? Fine.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.480
You don't want to help me?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.320
Then l'll find somebody else
that will.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.200
Like that noid cartoonist,
Jack Deebs.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.640
He's been around a lot lately.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.800
Yes, he has.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.040
The whack-a-do who thinks
he invented this place.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.240
What do you think l've been
talking about, Holli?

18:23.360 --> 18:24.320
Well, l'd watch it, honey,

18:24.360 --> 18:25.880

27:25.760 --> 27:27.240
You're so real, so strong.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.000
You could help comb my hair,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.080
Yes, l have failed.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.480
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo!

27:44.520 --> 27:47.360
Filthy bad guys

their miserable faces inside out

27:52.320 --> 27:54.240

30:41.440 --> 30:42.680
Little late for a lady

30:42.720 --> 30:44.720

don't you think?

30:46.240 --> 30:49.400
l got a couple of questions
for you, miss.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.040
Aw, come on, Officer.
Let it slide, would ya?

30:52.080 --> 30:53.520

30:58.680 --> 31:00.040
But what's it to you,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.760
Baby, baby, you don't

31:06.800 --> 31:07.880
You're late.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.040
Aw, you're killing me.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.360
Why are you so beautiful?

31:10.360 --> 31:11.520
Mm-mm-mm.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.320
What's wrong?
You don't look right.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.600
Aw, it's Holli.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.760
l think she's in heat again.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.360
With that noid from last night?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.640
Oh, don't worry about it.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.600
You know that. Wh-Why you always
want to bust...?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.720
Gotcha.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.400
All right.
Where you wanna go?

31:29.400 --> 31:30.520
Uh, movies?
Uh, dinner...?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.920
We have abused the privilege...

31:32.960 --> 31:34.240
Our color is fading.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.920
Repent, repent, all toons.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.880
Listen to me.
The end is near.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.200
Hey, Boss, we gotta go. We...

31:39.240 --> 31:40.720
A thousand pardons.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.440
An informer told me
he's here again.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.600
Holli and the goons got him.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.680
He's not just coming
through on a dream.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.120
Perhaps it is time
to pursue other avenues.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.400
Right, let's hit the bricks.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.560
Yeah, yeah, l know.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.200
Be careful, Frank.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.000
Oh, l think she's partial
to you.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.680
Yeah, but facts is facts.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.920
She's a doodle, and l'm not.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.000
Eh, l guess,

32:11.040 --> 32:13.080
but did l ever tell you
about the time

32:13.120 --> 32:15.880

delightfully-stacked hussy

32:15.920 --> 32:16.880
from the projects?

32:16.920 --> 32:18.120
Yeah.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.120
Right. Where to, Boss?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.320
The club.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.360
All right.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.680
Aye, aye, aye!

33:05.240 --> 33:07.600
Hey, Baby, how you doing?

33:07.640 --> 33:08.560

33:10.480 --> 33:12.400

33:12.440 --> 33:13.640
And no noids.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.720
Sorry, baby.
No noids.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.280
He is with me, too.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.040
Can't let the neighbors
push us around, can we?

33:34.240 --> 33:35.560
Freeze, asshole.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.520
Uh-oh!

33:37.560 --> 33:39.440
Cool World Police.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.520
Ooh!

33:40.560 --> 33:41.480
Copper!

33:41.520 --> 33:43.520
Up against the wall.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.040
Get your hands off me.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.200
Where are your manners, Harris?

33:47.240 --> 33:49.200
You, be quiet.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.760
Hey, who are you?

33:50.800 --> 33:52.880
Who are you?
l didn't create you.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.760
No shit, Sherlock.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.960
What'd you do with this, Deebs?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.920
l'm a cartoonist.
l drew all this.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.120
l have visions, l...

34:03.520 --> 34:05.240
l have visions.
l translate this.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.320
You do nothing, man.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.400
This place exists
with or without you.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.280
You believe me, right?
l'm not one of your creations.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.560
Don't believe him!

34:12.600 --> 34:14.159
No, you're not pretty enough.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.520
Good one.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.840
Have a seat.

34:21.719 --> 34:22.920
Ordinary fountain pen, right?

34:22.960 --> 34:23.920
Yeah.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.360
Wrong. Around here...

34:25.400 --> 34:26.800
Sit down!

34:26.840 --> 34:29.679
Around here, this
can be a big nuisance.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.639
You thirsty, Nails?

34:35.960 --> 34:37.360
Whoa!

34:42.440 --> 34:43.800
Get it?

34:43.840 --> 34:45.920
One should be careful
how they wave this thing.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.360
No, l don't get it.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.639
Of course
you don't get it,

34:48.679 --> 34:49.840
because you're a wackadoo.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.080
But here you are, Jack.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.000
And around here,
everything goes.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.960
Everything
except one thing!

34:58.000 --> 34:59.680
-Yeah, what?
-Yeah, yeah,

34:59.720 --> 35:00.920
we know.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.240
What's that?

35:04.280 --> 35:06.560
noids do not have sex
with doodles.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.720
Right? noids do not
have sex with doodles!

35:13.000 --> 35:15.280
lt's the oldest law
in Cool World.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.480
l've never had to enforce it,

35:16.520 --> 35:17.720
but you cross that line,

35:17.760 --> 35:21.560
and l'll slap you around,
make you piss like a puppy.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.560
Jack...

35:24.600 --> 35:27.520
you think she's got a thing
for you, don't you?

35:27.560 --> 35:29.120
That's sweet.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.600
But don't flatter
yourself.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.760
She's a waste of ink.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.760
Oh, yeah?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.400
The truth is,
she's been after me

35:34.440 --> 35:36.560
and every other noid
who's come through here.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.640
lt's just that no one's
been insane enough

35:38.680 --> 35:40.120
to get involved with her.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.360
You keep your pencil
in your pocket.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.840
You know what l mean?

35:48.600 --> 35:49.880
Yeah.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.440
l'll remember that, Officer.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.920
You can go now.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.960
Where did you get your
hair done, by the way?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.400
Get out of here.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.480
All right, the show's over!

35:59.520 --> 36:01.520
So, Harris,
you could have beat him.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.000
You could have beat him.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.920
You could of been somebody.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.280
Oh, you're not yellow,
are you, Harris?

36:08.920 --> 36:10.840
You did well, Jack.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.080
Hey, sexy.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.480
Mmm. lt's the man
with the badge.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.960
ln the flesh.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.560
Don't remind me.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.560
Oh-ho-ho.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.320
How can l help it?

37:02.840 --> 37:04.240
-Ah.
-Mmm.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.040
What are you doing to me?

37:06.080 --> 37:07.040
You're messing me up.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.960
Oh, honey, you're tense.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.720
lt's Holli again, isn't it?

37:14.760 --> 37:17.160
Yeah, Miss Holli
Would if she could.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.400
That dame...

37:19.440 --> 37:21.640
You heard anything?

37:21.680 --> 37:25.360
Now, you know l don't listen
to that sleazy cow.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.960
Mmm!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.440
Mmm!

37:30.880 --> 37:33.440
Don't . Just don't .

37:33.480 --> 37:34.840
Well, why?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.560
Because we can never finish it,
Lonette, you know?

37:37.600 --> 37:39.640
lt-it-it's frustrating.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.080
l'm , uh...

37:41.120 --> 37:44.960
l'm like a... l'm like a plug
without a socket, you know?

37:51.040 --> 37:53.240
Hey, Frank?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.040
Hey, what?

37:55.080 --> 37:57.520
Did you ever do it
in the Real World?

37:57.560 --> 38:02.360
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

38:02.400 --> 38:03.800
No.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.280
No way.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.800
Maybe you and me?

38:07.840 --> 38:09.760
l can't have that
in the Real World.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.440
Uh-uh. l can't live without you.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.240
But l can't be with you,
you know?

38:17.280 --> 38:18.720
lt's , jus... agh!

38:21.120 --> 38:22.920
What do you do, huh?

38:22.960 --> 38:25.080
What do you do?

38:25.120 --> 38:27.160
Well, then...

38:27.200 --> 38:30.000
we're just going to have
to pretend then, aren't we?

38:43.640 --> 38:44.920
Hey, Boss!

38:46.880 --> 38:48.720
Ooh!

38:50.840 --> 38:52.120
Boss!

38:52.120 --> 38:53.560
l heard you, Nails.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.560
Oh, my God, Boss!

38:57.560 --> 38:58.960
l wouldn't do it!

39:04.400 --> 39:06.120
Oh! Whew!

39:06.160 --> 39:08.600
Hey, Boss, did l ever
tell you about...?

39:08.640 --> 39:10.400
Shut up, Nails.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.000
Jack.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.200
Jack.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.760
Come home, baby.

39:39.160 --> 39:43.600
No... no... no...

39:43.640 --> 39:47.480
No. No! No! No! No!

40:27.760 --> 40:29.120
Glad you dropped in.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.440
Well, here we are--
Holli's humble abode.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.440
Do you think she'll let us in?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.160
Forget it!

41:14.200 --> 41:17.080
This party
is by invitation only.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.160
This door has got an attitude.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.880
How much further?

41:41.880 --> 41:45.080
Oh, uh... l'd say
we're halfway up.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.000
Or halfway down.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.000
Right.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.760
God, l hate heights.

41:58.760 --> 42:02.200
Nails, this is no time
to catch a cold.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.960
lt is not a cold, Boss.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.840
l am allergic to clouds.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.280
What?!

42:07.320 --> 42:11.280
Ah... ah... ah...

42:11.320 --> 42:14.160
Oh... oh...

42:14.200 --> 42:15.360
Choo!

42:25.720 --> 42:27.440
Pull this?

42:39.800 --> 42:42.800
Ah... ah...

42:42.840 --> 42:44.640
Don't even think about it.

42:44.680 --> 42:48.040
Ah...

42:48.120 --> 42:49.080
choo!

42:55.000 --> 42:57.960
That step's smashingly good!
Smashingly!

42:58.000 --> 42:59.400
Yeah.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.880
Make sure no one
gets out this door.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.520
Oh! Oh! Absolutemont,
Boss.

43:18.280 --> 43:19.720
Oh!

43:31.560 --> 43:33.600
Stretcher bearers!

43:33.640 --> 43:35.080
Stretcher bearers!

43:41.960 --> 43:44.920
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

44:00.080 --> 44:01.560
Well, hello, Harris.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.240
Welcome to the party.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.640
And what a swell party it is.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.240
Thanks for having me.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.520
l should have known
riffraff like yourself

44:08.560 --> 44:10.800
would be involved
in this equation, Sparks.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.400
What equation
is that, Harris?

44:12.440 --> 44:13.680
l've discovered

44:13.720 --> 44:14.960
that if you look for trouble,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.400
you find it.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.880
What's your problem?

44:17.880 --> 44:19.200
Bad childhood.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.200
Where's the noid?

44:21.240 --> 44:24.080
You're the only noid here,
Harris.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.040
Ooh!

44:29.080 --> 44:31.760
Last warning.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.880
You stay away from the noid,

44:33.920 --> 44:37.160
or you're closed
for business permanently.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.280
Have a splendid evening.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.680
You want to know
what it is about you

44:44.720 --> 44:46.480
that really kicks my ass,
Harris?

44:49.400 --> 44:51.080
How about my foot?

44:51.120 --> 44:52.520
Well, you prance around here

44:52.560 --> 44:54.920
waving that gun around
like you're some big deal.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.880
And all this time,
you could cross over

44:56.920 --> 44:58.360
to the Real World,

44:58.360 --> 45:00.000
but you haven't got the guts.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.320
You don't have what
it takes to be real.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.240
That makes you
a wimp in my book.

45:06.640 --> 45:09.360
You may be right, Slick.

45:12.200 --> 45:15.280
Be content with the cards
you've been dealt.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.280
Oh!

45:29.880 --> 45:31.040
What's the deal?

45:31.080 --> 45:32.640
lt's getting serious, Nails.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.240
Holli.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.160
We got to find Jack Deebs.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.480
Right.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.680
Go for it!
Go for it!

45:46.360 --> 45:48.040
Should l get the door for you,
Jack?

45:49.560 --> 45:51.400
Oh, yeah!
Oh, Yeah!

45:53.240 --> 45:54.640
Go for it, Jack!

45:54.680 --> 45:58.040
You better have an appointment!

45:58.080 --> 46:00.560
Go on, Jack.
Go on, Jack.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.360
He does...

46:02.400 --> 46:04.520
but you don't .

46:04.560 --> 46:07.200
But Holli said we could watch.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.360
Watch what?

46:10.400 --> 46:11.760
Go on up.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.000
Go on up.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.600
Go on.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.160
Bring me a souvenir, Jack.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.800
Hey, Jack.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.080
l've been waiting for you.

46:34.640 --> 46:38.600
You like looking at me, Jack,
don't you?

46:47.240 --> 46:48.200
Yow!

46:55.680 --> 46:58.520
Man is in the bedroom.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.560
Run, girls, run!
Oh-ho! Oh-ho!

47:08.680 --> 47:10.560
-Okay...
-What?

47:10.600 --> 47:12.920
You listen to me, uh, Holli.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.240
That cop, uh, Harris, um,

47:15.280 --> 47:17.320
he said we... we...

47:17.360 --> 47:19.720
can't go any further
than this, Holli.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.720
-l'm so hot for you, Jack.
-Yeah.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.320
Are you going
to follow the rules?

47:23.360 --> 47:24.280
No.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.600
Or are you going to follow...
your instincts?

47:27.640 --> 47:28.560
Yeah.

47:28.600 --> 47:31.400
Oh, but Holli said
we could watch.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.440
l'll be right back.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.520
Yep! Oh, yeah! Oh! Yeah!

47:53.560 --> 47:54.720
Ooh...

47:54.760 --> 47:55.720
Ooh.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.360
Ah... ah...

48:00.720 --> 48:02.680
Ooh.

48:02.720 --> 48:04.640
Mm-hmm.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.200
We're almost there.

48:14.240 --> 48:16.040
Whoa! Okay...

48:43.120 --> 48:46.280
Whoa... whoa!

48:46.320 --> 48:47.400
Whoa!

48:47.440 --> 48:49.000
Ooh!

48:51.200 --> 48:52.160
Holli!

48:57.480 --> 48:59.000
Holli...

48:59.040 --> 49:00.400
Whoa...

49:26.920 --> 49:29.880
Mm, was it good for you?

49:29.920 --> 49:32.360
lt wasn't what l expected.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.960
Y-You gonna go in there

50:32.000 --> 50:34.760
and-and make it up
to Lonette, boss?

50:34.760 --> 50:36.320
Yeah, why not.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.600
The fact is,
she's the best thing that

50:38.600 --> 50:39.760
ever happened to me.

50:39.800 --> 50:40.960
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.320
Oh, l could put overtime
in on Deebs' Porsche.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.800
l'm tireless.

50:45.800 --> 50:46.880
Forget it.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.080
The goons can't touch him
in Sweet Place,

50:49.120 --> 50:52.040
and we'd just run ourselves
ragged giving him the shadow.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.640
-Well... what should l do?
-Hmm?

50:54.680 --> 50:56.560
Man the phones,

50:56.600 --> 50:57.760
Somebody might l.D. him.

50:57.800 --> 50:58.880
And if that happens,

50:58.920 --> 50:59.920
you call me.

You call me here or Lonette's ,

Go away.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.440

51:52.400 --> 51:53.760
Tough night?

The usual.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.240
Yeah.

51:56.280 --> 52:00.040
Why you want to hang
around here, huh?

52:00.080 --> 52:01.520
This place should be erased.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.920
Hey... it's a living.

52:03.960 --> 52:05.440
Even a doodle's got to eat.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.320
Why don't you put that arm
around me.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.360

an unscheduled trip

52:31.000 --> 52:32.160

Ooh... Oh! Doh!

52:33.480 --> 52:34.800
Holli?! Sheesh!

52:34.840 --> 52:38.280
No end of trouble that

52:38.320 --> 52:41.960
Why, she might damage the entire
interworld matrix or something.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.480
l don't give a doodle!

You are a biomorphic menace.

57:11.400 --> 57:14.520

You know, they got
95 different things, Holli.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.400
What l want to slow down for?

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.480

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.960
You think any of these men
are gonna say no to Holli?

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.920
Not on your life, pal.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.840
Gentlemen prefer blondes.

Wonderful old standard.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.840
" Let's Make Love."

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.520
Hey! She's with me!

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.400
No, she's with us.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.360
Hey!

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.760
Stay out!

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.000
Hit it.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.320
Uh, Brian, please.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.800
Here we sit and we chatter

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.840
What are we thinking of?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.080
-Let's not make with the patter
-Oh, whoa.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.360
Baby

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.360
Let's make love

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.720
Oh, my, but it's stifling

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.880
lf you roar like a lion

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.160
l could coo like a dove

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.640
lf you're sold, begin buying

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.560
Baby

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.200
Let's make love

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.200
Gosh, it's hot

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.360
No, don't turn TV on

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.560
lnstead just turn me on

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:07.640
l'll light up like neon...

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.080
When your partner gets inked,
you do something about it.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.400
He was your partner,
so you do something.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.360
Well, l'm not buying it.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.320
Well, how about " a man's got to
do what a man's got to do" ?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.920
Can't you just think about me

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.040
for a minute, Frank?

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.520
l mean, where does this
leave me?

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.480
What are you mad about?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.480
Oh!

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.560
l'm mad because
you talk about crossing,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.960
and-and you don't even care...

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.280
l don't care?
how it makes me feel.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.640
Whoa, whoa.
How do you feel, Lon?

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.920
How do you feel?

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.440
Left out.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.280
You think l want
to go back there?

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.960
You think l want to go back?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.720
Well, why wouldn't you
want to go back?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.160
That's real to you, isn't it?!

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.920
Let me tell you something
about over there.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.480
lt hurts over there.
lt-lt's lonely over there.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.320
lt's a war over there.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.320
They got eight million ways
for you to die, hon,

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.840
and all of them are permanent.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.560
This is real for me,
this. With you.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.800
And if l want to stay
with you, l got to go back.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.320
Because if Jack Deebs
and Holli Would

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.680
are after what
l think they are,

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.440
there won't be
any here or there.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.560
Understand, Loni?
No more here.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.080
Just go ahead!

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.000
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.080
l'm comin' back.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.320
Jack.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.000
Jack.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.400
What's going on?

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.680
Something's wrong.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.320
Something's very, very wrong.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.360
No shit, pal.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.400
So what is it?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.960
l mean, l'm ... l'm up there,
and l was just...

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.280
l was moving and shaking
with the best of 'em.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.200
And all of a sudden, l was...

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.680
l-l went doodle again.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.120
l mean...

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.400
Look at this, Ma. No hands!

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh, Frank, don't do that!

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.800
l wouldn't do that.
Come on!

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.600
No!

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.120
Good luck, Frank.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960
Please just let me think.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.680
Let me think.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.720
Cool, Jack.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.720
Really cool.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840
l guess you have a tough time

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.360
driving and thinking
at the same time, huh?

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.120
Oh!

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.280
The Spike of Power!

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.240
The what?!

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.480
The Spike could heal me.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.760
Ooh, l guess Vinnie put
the Spike

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.760
at the top of the casino.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.480
You're nuts.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.160
You are nuts.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.200
Don't say l'm nuts.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.440
l've had enough ego
out of you, pal.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.760
And you used to think
you made me up.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.080
You're thinking
like a doodle, Holli.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.640
There is no Spike of Power.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.520
There's got to be
a Spike of Power.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.000
And l'm going to find it
right now.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.120
No, you're not.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.439
Okay? Yeah.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.880
We're going there, Jack.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.279
No, we're not.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.359
You're a nice fellow, Jack.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:25.760
Don't piss me off.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.840
Oh, yeah?

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.439
What are you going to do
about it, Holli?

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.760
Huh?

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.680
Goddamn it!

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.200
What are you doing here, Harris?

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.800
l'm taking you
and the bimbo back.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.560
What are you going to do?
Shoot me?

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.560
Why don't you shoot me,
goddamn it!?

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.960
Shoot me, Harris.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.280
Go on, shoot...

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.760
Don't push me!
Don't push me!

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.000
You just couldn't take

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.920
a piece of good advice,
could you?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.400
No, Jack, you had to listen
to your Johnson.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.640
l've had it with you, Harris.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.000
l've had it with you,
goddamn it!

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.880
You've had it with me?!

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.680
You've had it with me,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.920
you piece of shit?

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.240
You screw us all
for a piece of ass,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.200
and you've had it with me?

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.200
Where is she?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.400
Great.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.040
lt's happening, Jack.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.920
Got news for you, Harris.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.920
lt's happening to her, too.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.240
Jack!

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.920
Jack, l saw it this time.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.160
-Jack, l saw it. l swear it.
-Jennifer...

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.120
l saw this thing.
lt ate your house again.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:05.920
Remember when we came
over earlier?

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.560
Jennifer...

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.160
l wasn't imagining things. l...

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.640
All right, Jack.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.960
Oh, this is another friend
from out of town?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.160
Uh-huh, yeah.
l-l mean...

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.280
What happened to your suit?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.240
What's going on

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.360
between this guy and me,

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.520
it's -it's -it's kind
of, uh... complex.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.640
l-l can explain it

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.120
some other time.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.320
l'll bet.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.320
Look, we got no more time
for Goldilocks here.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.440
Where do we find Holli?

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.040
Okay, she went
to the Union Plaza.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.280
-The Spike.
-She went to meet this...

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.240
She went to meet

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.200
this guy, Vegas Vinnie.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.880
The only problem is,
she took my car, so...

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.880
l've got my mom's car.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.040
Let's go, miss.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.600
We're trying
to protect the balance

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.160
of the entire known
universe here.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.360
Oh, gee, l guess my mom
won't chuck a fit, then,

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.680
if we took it, huh?

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.880
Wow!

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.640
Miss?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.680
Miss?

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.920
Can l help you, Miss?

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.920
l'm looking for Vegas Vinnie.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.160
There's no... there's no
Vegas Vinnie here.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.440
l'm sorry.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.560
He owns the place.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.240
l don't ... l...
There's no Vegas Vinnie here.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.480
l'm sorry.
l-l can't help you.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.280
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.360
No.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.800
Sorry.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.800
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.800
Do you know Vegas Vinnie?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.760
Vegas Vinnie is a story
based on a real guy--

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.920
this doc l met--

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.040
when l first went across,
uh, 50 years ago.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.160
Cool World's real?

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.480
Neat!

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.760
He and l,
we mapped out the tunnel,

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.040
the passageway
between both worlds.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.920
And we saw how easily
one could disrupt that balance

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.400
and destroy both universes.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.160
Destroy the universe?

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.640
When you have
some money to spend,

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.160
we'd love to see you, honey.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.960
Until then,
you have to keep out.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.800
l can't ...

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.920
Oh!

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.680
Uh, pretty-looking sign
we got up there, huh, Miss?

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.240
Yeah, that spike in the center.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.120
lt's real bright.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.560
You sound kind of down, Miss.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.480
Uh, have bad luck
at the tables?

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.360
Let's just say it
ain't been my day.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.920
Oh, well, don't worry, uh...

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.720
Good Lord!

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.280
l never thought
l'd see it happen!

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.280
Miss, what you looking for,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.000
you can't find around here.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.160
You better go.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.240
How do you know
what l'm lookin' for?

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.400
You do know
what l am, don't you?

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.640
You know where l'm from.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.200
Oh, my goodness.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.560
Old man, l'm not leaving
till l find out

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.920
how you know so much. Talk!

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.160
Talk!

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.160
You're not telling me
everything you know.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.680
Y-Y...

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.520
Y-You...

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.280
Y-Y-You're d-doodle!

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.840
ln Cool World,
they knew me as "Whiskers."

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.400
Dr. Vincent Whiskers.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.560
Didn't you touch the Spike?

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.960
Sure, l touched it,
but l couldn't hold it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.040
No one can!

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.560
So it is up there!

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.880
And it is real,

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.240
and it's going to make me real.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.680
Sure, it's up there,

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.480
but it's not going
to do you any good.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.120
Just because you weren't
man enough to hold onto it.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.720
l need the force
in that Spike.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.640
And l'm going up there.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.080
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.400
That power doesn't belong
to you!

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.600
l don't care.
l want it.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.960
And l don't care...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.720
Stop!

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.600
Cease! Desist!

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600
l mean it!

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.760
-Ow, ow!
-Make this easy on yourself.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.840
There she is.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.440
She looks pretty.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.120
Come on,
you little troublemaker.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.080
Nobody's going to stop me now.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.920
Harris, help me.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.200
You've got to stop that girl.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240
lf she moves it,
it could be the end

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.000
of everything.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.520
Doc? Oh, my God.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.720
-l gotta get...
-Wait, wait.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.760
Jack, please, l need you here

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.080
to take care
of my friend. Please.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.040
This is my department.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.000
l gotta stop her, Harris.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.080
-Jack!
-Let go!

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.800
Wait, Jack!

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.760
Let me go, Harris.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.360
l'm not gonna hurt her.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.560
Help him.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.560
Holli.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.760
Crazy doodle bitch.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.240
All right.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.400
Hello, Holli.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.160
Guess what. You're through.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.320
You know, sweetheart,

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.680
you look good in the flesh.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.680
lt's almost a shame
l gotta take you back.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.640
You are going back, you know.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.200
Would!

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.920
Um...

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.680
You're squeezing my head.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.880
There.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.200
As good as new.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.200
Where do you think you're going?

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.480
lt's over.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.960
What are you gonna do-- jump?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.920
Just get down.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.240
For Christ's sake.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.600
What? You got ink
for brains? Get down.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.080
Don't piss me off, Would.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.760
You go on that roof,

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800
you screw us all.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.520
l'm not messing around here.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.760
Oh, Christ.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.120
There's nothing up there.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.240
Let's just go home,

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.200
fix this mess.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.120
Get down!

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.680
Would!

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.160
Don't .

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.120
Harris.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.200
What?!

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.800
Harris, help me.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.800
Ah...

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.880
Help me.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.120
Oh, Harris... help me.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.160
Hold on.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.720
l should do the world a favor
and let you fall.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.320
Easy.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360
Easy does it.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.320
Good.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.840
Now, hold on.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.080
Here we go.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.360
Here we go.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.080
We're going home.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.680
All right, careful.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.520
Come on.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.240
Oh, my God.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.880
Jack, this is your chance
to make it right.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.360
lt's up to you now.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.680
Okay. Okay.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.600
This time, l'm gonna
do something right.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.600
He's gonna kill himself.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.600
He's fulfilling his destiny.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.920
He's becoming a hero.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.280
Oh, please.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.560
The Spike.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.200
lt's up to me
to return the Spike.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.000
Got it!

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:27.960
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.120
Whoa.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.360
The pain is unbearable.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.000
Hit me.

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.640
Deuces wild?

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.760
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.360
The world has
only one chance left.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.080
lt's up to me to return the
Spike and plug the hole.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.280
Huh! You fiends!

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.400
Trying to stop me.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.680
Baby, baby...

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.400
The king! Oh, it's the king!

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.440
Oh, l hate being
bottled up like that.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.720
Oh, man, boss.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.040
Hold on. Hold on.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.640
Hmm?

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.360
Feel the air, Jack.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.760
We're staying.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.920
l like it here, Jack.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.080
Come here.

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.560
Give me the Spike, Jack.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.440
You love me, don't you, Jack?

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.320
Yes, l do.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.440
Well, then, help me.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.520
Give it to me, Jack.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.880
Okay, honey-poo.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.600
Hey, goodie-goodie-goodie.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.360
Pencil dicks.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.320
Aha!

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.440
A trick!

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.640
On second thought,
l must do what is right

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.720
and return the Spike.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.920
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.880
Whoa!

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.320
Oh, golly, oh!

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.200
Hey!

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.800
Damn!

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.400
Jack?!

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.200
He-he's gone.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.160
He's ...

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.680
He's gone.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.920
Dead?

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:39.080
l don't know for sure,
but l don't think so.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.040
You know,

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.680
maybe the Spike protected them.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.080
lts power is beyond

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.080
our understanding.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.040
Mm-hmm.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.960
l'm sorry he didn't make it.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.800
l got to take him
back with me.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.400
There's a nice gal back there.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.720
She deserves to see him,
dead or alive.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.600
Okay, Doc, let 'er rip.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.440
Wow.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.080
Arriba, arriba, arriba, arriba!

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.720
Oh!

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.720
Oh, Nails!

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.960
He didn't make it.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.760
l'm sorry.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.320
Oh, Frank, honey! No, please!

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.520
Oh, no, please,
you can't leave me!

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.640
Oh, no!

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.720
Who killed him, Nails?

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.040
He was pushed off a building.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.000
Who pushed him?

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.000
Holli Would.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.000
Holli Would?

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.280
That bitch!

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.720
Nails,

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.000
was she a doodle
when she aced him?

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.000
Yeah! So what?!

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.480
So what?

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.200
Oh! So what?

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.240
Well, what happens
to noids who traffic

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.600
in the Cool World, Nails,

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.360
when they get killed
by a doodle?

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.120
They become a doodle themselves.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880
Hmm?

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.320
Hot dog! Dig it! Dig me!

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.240
Ba-ba-bum...

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.200
ba!

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.280
Oh, my God!

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.080
Oh, Nails, he's alive!

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.120
Ooh, and he's gorgeous, too.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.840
Hubba-bubba, baby.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.840
What do you think?

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.560
Ooh, you're a hero, Harris.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.040
You saved the world.

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.400
So what are you waiting for?

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.400
Come and get it.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.640
Ooh, Frankie...

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.840
so, did you do it
while you were back there

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.880
in the real world?

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.480
Did you do it
while you were real?

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.520
Do you ever think about
going back there so you can?

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.320
There's no reason now.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.520
Hey, boss, we got to go.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.440
Get out of here!

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.000
l'm sorry.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.640
l'm so sorry.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.160
l can't stand myself.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.080
Oh! l should have
all eight legs.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.560
Well, then,

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:58.840
we're just going
to have to stop pretending now,

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.200
aren't we?

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.160
Bum, bum, ba.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.080
Bye-bye, folks.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.920
Have a nice life.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.120
What a beautiful landscape.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.080
Let's see.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.800
We can put the house
over here,

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.760
the studio over here.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.040
l'll still draw, of course.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.960
We'll raise children over here,
l'll fight crime over there.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.360
Oh, we're going to be
deliriously happy, honey-poo.
