00:37.070 --> 00:42.337
<i>In ancient times, the world was
ruled by gods and monsters.</i>

00:44.444 --> 00:47.436
<i>But it was the half-god Perseus,
my son...</i>

00:47.614 --> 00:51.311
<i>...who defeated the Kraken
and saved humanity.</i>

00:53.019 --> 00:57.251
<i>For his courage, I offered him
a place to rule at my side.</i>

00:58.725 --> 00:59.749
<i>But Perseus...</i>

00:59.926 --> 01:03.692
<i>...was strong-willed
and chose a different path.</i>

01:03.863 --> 01:07.026
<i>He vowed to live as a man.</i>

01:08.768 --> 01:11.066
<i>Even when fate took his wife...</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:13.899
<i>...he would not pray for help, from me...</i>

01:14.541 --> 01:16.099
<i>...or the other gods.</i>

01:17.710 --> 01:20.702
<i>And now the time of the gods is ending.</i>

01:20.947 --> 01:25.145
<i>But the son of Zeus cannot hide
from his destiny forever.</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:29.888
Now pull it in. Do it again.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.991
Throw in the other one real quick.
Go on. I'll tie this off.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.561
Good catch today, Dad.

01:42.969 --> 01:46.268
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it myself.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.934
You made it yourself? Heh.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.673
I want to be a good god
and do good things.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.816
- There's no such thing as good gods.
- Some of them are good.

01:57.984 --> 02:01.511
Ah. Helius, there's more to life
than gods and Titans.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.617
Hey, Clea. I have a confession to make.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.287
I, uh, needed him for chores
so he skipped studying.

02:09.529 --> 02:13.260
Now, you do a good job, make me proud.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.181
I know you're here.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.160
I visit him sometimes in his dreams.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.928
He's like his father. A strong-willed boy.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.499
You just passing through?

02:56.476 --> 02:57.807
No.

02:58.978 --> 02:59.842
I need your help...

03:00.013 --> 03:01.071
...Perseus.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.374
You're the great god Zeus.
You don't need my help.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.515
There is a calamity coming.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.679
It will affect us all. Gods and men.

03:11.457 --> 03:14.392
- The humans may have stopped praying to us...
- With good reason.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.085
...but there are consequences.

03:17.163 --> 03:19.495
Without prayer, we gods lose our power.

03:19.666 --> 03:24.365
When our power leaves us,
all our work comes undone. All of it.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.746
The walls of Tartarus are falling.

03:37.183 --> 03:41.745
It is emptying all its demons onto the earth.
The first are already here.

03:42.689 --> 03:47.183
If our power diminishes much further,
we gods will become mortal.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.920
We will die and Kronos himself will escape.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.131
It will mean chaos. The end of the world.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.229
What am I meant to do?

03:58.137 --> 03:59.399
This is business for gods.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.573
We need all our children now.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.099
Perhaps, together...

04:04.277 --> 04:05.744
...we can remedy this.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.642
But we need every shred of power, Perseus.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.609
I will never leave my son.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.619
I know your heart better
than you know it yourself.

04:20.459 --> 04:24.328
You believe your human half
makes you unworthy to join us.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.063
You will learn someday that...

04:26.232 --> 04:27.756
...being half-human...

04:27.934 --> 04:31.131
...makes you stronger than a god,
not weaker.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.167
I think you should go.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.240
Sleep well, Perseus.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.454
<i>I will never leave my son.</i>

06:31.224 --> 06:32.782
<i>Zeus.</i>

06:40.800 --> 06:42.267
Poseidon.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.429
Brother.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.263
It has been an age.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.304
Indeed, it has.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.477
Ares.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.682
My son.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.216
Where's my brother Perseus?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.287
Gone fishing?

07:05.291 --> 07:06.690
Yes.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.691
What a brave and noble decision.

07:16.702 --> 07:17.634
Let us go, then.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.221
Tartarus.
The great prison of the underworld.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.418
Brother Hades!

07:44.030 --> 07:45.588
We have come to your domain...

07:46.265 --> 07:47.755
...as agreed!

07:48.267 --> 07:49.757
Show yourself to us!

07:58.244 --> 08:00.542
After so many years...

08:00.746 --> 08:04.807
...the sons of Kronos, together once more.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.678
Brothers in arms.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.286
Hades...

08:08.554 --> 08:12.684
...you are the great
ruler of the underworld.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.490
Allow us to enter and help you rebuild...

08:16.662 --> 08:17.890
...the walls of Tartarus.

08:18.798 --> 08:22.393
My beloved brother,
who banished me here for eternity...

08:22.568 --> 08:25.833
...to look after our father, now seeks...

08:26.005 --> 08:27.632
...reconciliation.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.969
We must forget the past, brother...

08:32.144 --> 08:33.371
...and unite.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.506
Yes.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.548
But on my terms.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.586
Poseidon!

08:57.403 --> 08:58.734
Above you!

09:05.945 --> 09:07.003
Poseidon.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.692
It has begun.

10:10.309 --> 10:11.867
Helius?!

10:12.678 --> 10:13.736
Helius!

10:18.751 --> 10:19.775
Stay away, stay away!

10:26.025 --> 10:27.151
Helius?

10:27.493 --> 10:28.585
Helius.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.548
Chimera!

11:05.531 --> 11:06.691
Helius!

11:09.135 --> 11:10.124
Have you seen Helius?!

11:13.806 --> 11:14.932
Helius!

11:16.742 --> 11:17.504
Get back!

11:19.145 --> 11:21.739
Keep away! Its venom catches fire!

11:24.083 --> 11:25.482
Stay down!

11:54.046 --> 11:55.604
Helius, go with them!

11:59.985 --> 12:01.282
Take him!

12:01.520 --> 12:02.680
I'll find you! Go!

12:06.559 --> 12:07.423
Go!

12:15.034 --> 12:16.023
- Dad!
- Run!

12:16.202 --> 12:16.861
Go!

12:19.071 --> 12:20.231
Helius!

12:24.009 --> 12:24.634
Helius!

12:29.548 --> 12:31.812
- Dad, hurry!
- I'm coming, son!

12:33.819 --> 12:35.810
Helius! Stay there!

12:40.226 --> 12:41.250
Dad!

12:50.636 --> 12:51.330
Helius!

12:52.671 --> 12:53.467
Here!

12:53.906 --> 12:55.066
Come and get me!

14:07.646 --> 14:10.513
What are you waiting for?! Burn me!

14:35.541 --> 14:36.667
Sit.

14:43.082 --> 14:43.776
Ohh.

14:45.918 --> 14:46.942
Things are happening...

14:47.152 --> 14:49.882
...in the world, Perseus.
You know that, you have instincts.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.046
The son of a god.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.352
A son needs a father.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.089
I made a vow to lo.

14:58.264 --> 15:02.360
I know, I know,
I was there delivering your son.

15:02.534 --> 15:05.264
You vowed to your wife
you'd never let Helius wield a sword.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.598
That you'd live with him
as a simple fisherman.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.738
Well, that's a fine game in normal times.

15:13.212 --> 15:16.181
But if you have power,
you also have a duty.

15:17.616 --> 15:19.413
Just fix my body...

15:19.919 --> 15:21.750
...and leave my soul to me.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.583
Where are we going?

15:30.996 --> 15:33.191
I need to speak to my father.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.331
There's nothing to be frightened of.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.473
This is the Mount of Idols.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.769
The closest place to the heavens.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.213
It's a place where people come
to worship the gods.

15:52.518 --> 15:53.951
Or at least they used to come.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.588
Zeus?

16:06.932 --> 16:08.524
Father.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.852
Poseidon.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.148
What happened?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.986
Hades and Ares have joined Kronos...

16:35.294 --> 16:36.852
...against humanity.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.022
All the gods have disappeared.

16:40.199 --> 16:43.293
- I fear the worst.
- Here, here.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.169
I got you, I got you.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.067
Where's my father?

16:51.276 --> 16:52.470
Captured.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.175
You must journey to the underworld
and free him.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.206
They took my father.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.477
You're the only hope left in this world.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.820
Or there will be oblivion.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.886
How do I do it?

17:11.597 --> 17:12.928
I'm only half a god.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.156
Then you must find another half-god.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.665
Agenor.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.829
He's my son.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.540
He's with Queen Andromeda.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.742
Tell him to take you to the Fallen One.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.716
Poseidon.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.817
Take this. Use it.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.453
If my son...

17:43.629 --> 17:46.223
...survives and proves worthy...

17:46.832 --> 17:48.459
...give it to him.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.633
My own son betrays me.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.969
Only when it suits you,
you remember I am your son.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.474
Hades.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.012
You're sweating like a human, brother.
Next, it'll be tears.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.877
Don't waste words on him.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.978
Kronos is waiting...

18:42.287 --> 18:43.481
...Father.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.151
What?

18:46.325 --> 18:48.623
Our father has offered us a deal.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.455
You fool!

18:51.430 --> 18:53.660
If we help him to escape Tartarus...

18:53.832 --> 18:58.132
...he will allow we few gods who remain
to keep our immortality.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.533
- No!
- Let him speak.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.500
Let him speak.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.304
Are you becoming weak?

19:05.644 --> 19:10.013
You're in the underworld, Ares,
where it's wise to obey me.

19:13.118 --> 19:15.279
You forget our father
once tried to kill us.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.682
No, I remember everything.

19:18.190 --> 19:23.355
And what exactly does our father want from
us in return for our precious immortality?

19:23.529 --> 19:28.796
We simply offer him the last of your
divine powers so that he may free himself.

19:31.436 --> 19:32.960
Oh, Hades.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.965
What have I done to you?

19:46.985 --> 19:49.010
You laugh as if you had a choice.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.985
There is no choice.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.092
I hope you have enough of them.

19:57.663 --> 19:58.493
Pull him.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.417
You'll need it more than me.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.785
Pegasus.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.693
Go on.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.003
He likes you.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.417
Me, on the other hand....

21:01.159 --> 21:02.217
I love you.

21:02.628 --> 21:03.890
I know.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.158
Come on.

21:12.604 --> 21:16.597
Eh, whoa.
Keep it straight. Have it look good.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.095
Come on, boy.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.472
More Chimera! Archers!

21:54.279 --> 21:55.974
Go, go, go!

21:56.148 --> 21:58.480
Ready! Fire!

22:01.720 --> 22:04.314
- Chimera!
- Ready!

22:04.523 --> 22:06.115
Hold your lines. Hold your lines!

22:08.460 --> 22:10.018
Out of the way!

22:10.462 --> 22:12.327
Hold your fire!

22:12.864 --> 22:15.594
- I said hold your fire!
- Queen Andromeda.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.802
Ah, keep it straight. Oy!

22:20.605 --> 22:22.038
Whoa!

22:32.417 --> 22:34.146
You used to be a lot better at this.

22:36.655 --> 22:41.422
All hail Perseus, killer of the Kraken.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.560
Hail Perseus!

22:48.333 --> 22:50.358
Great Perseus.

22:50.869 --> 22:54.737
If it is action you're after,
you are a little late.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.572
I'm just here to see Queen Andromeda.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.041
This is a battlefield.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.543
- I am in command here.
- Uh-huh.

23:03.248 --> 23:05.045
Well, I wish to speak to the queen.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.549
And the queen wishes to speak to you.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.782
Your Majesty.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.155
Come on.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.161
Hail Perseus.

23:28.173 --> 23:31.040
You've obviously been
in your own battles, Perseus.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.939
I've been busy with mine.

23:34.312 --> 23:35.802
Yeah, you have.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.978
I won't keep you.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.052
It's been too long.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.960
- I have a son now.
- I know. I'd like to meet him.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.392
And my wife, she...
- I know.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.636
I'm sorry.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.606
Your Majesty.

24:06.278 --> 24:10.146
For the sake of the men, we must
resolve our differences before sunset.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.146
I made it clear we continue to fight...

24:12.317 --> 24:13.841
...the Chimera invaders.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.453
Today in the field we lost 300 men...

24:16.621 --> 24:19.283
...for the death of four Chimera.
We have...

24:19.458 --> 24:22.825
...offended the gods. We need to pray.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.586
You'd pray to Ares, perhaps?

24:24.763 --> 24:26.958
As soldiers always have.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.926
What if I was to tell you that Ares
is your enemy now?

24:30.101 --> 24:31.534
I would make peace with him.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.831
You would make peace with the god of war?

24:35.607 --> 24:36.301
Perseus.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.139
What's your strategy?

24:41.513 --> 24:44.141
There's a way we can end this,
and then I can get home.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.209
What is this for?
- It's to cut the oars for my trireme.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.477
I need 170 oars...

24:49.454 --> 24:50.113
...for the three rows...

24:50.288 --> 24:50.947
...one oar per man.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.120
This looks like a pick.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.691
- lt is, however, the rudder
for my flagship. GUARD: Quiet!

24:55.994 --> 24:58.155
Morning checks, Your Majesty.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.528
Always eventful.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.791
Oh, Your Majesty. Ah. So good to see you.

25:03.969 --> 25:07.769
- This is Agenor. He's a liar and a thief.
- I know it didn't work out between us...

25:07.973 --> 25:10.237
...but, please, do try and get over it.

25:10.408 --> 25:12.842
Have you ever had a woman
love you so much...

25:13.278 --> 25:15.041
...she locks you up like a pet rabbit?

25:15.213 --> 25:16.976
He wanted my hand in marriage.

25:17.148 --> 25:20.083
When I refused, he tried to run away
with the crown jewels.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.344
I think it's my extraordinary eyes.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.921
Actually, you got the eyes of your father.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.187
Do you know his father?

25:29.995 --> 25:31.485
Yeah, Agenor here...

25:31.897 --> 25:33.865
...he's the son of the great god Poseidon.

25:36.835 --> 25:39.861
Your new boyfriend is clearly insane.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.105
I'm your cousin, Agenor.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.034
I'm the son of Zeus.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.345
Half-god and abandoned just like you.

25:49.814 --> 25:50.906
If my father sent you...

25:51.082 --> 25:53.050
...I want nothing to do with you.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.716
Your father is dead.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.412
Gods don't die.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.221
They do now.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.390
Good. Could you do me a favor?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.620
Anything.
- Go to hell.

26:06.097 --> 26:07.860
That's exactly where I'm going.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.961
I just need information.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.470
Your father told me...

26:15.640 --> 26:17.870
...that you could help me
get to the Fallen One.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.214
You long for the ocean, don't you?

26:28.086 --> 26:30.782
It's like a thirst you cannot quench.

26:32.891 --> 26:35.155
It must be hell for you in here.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.159
I want a royal pardon.

26:47.973 --> 26:48.962
Granted.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.742
I want my body weight in gold.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.136
Granted.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.505
Few gold coins, you're so scrawny.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.845
Let me see. What else have I dreamt of
as I lay here in my cell?

27:01.019 --> 27:02.384
Don't push it.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.590
I'm gonna need a boat, your fastest boat.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.022
The Fallen One lives far across the ocean.

27:09.961 --> 27:10.689
Where?

27:10.895 --> 27:13.625
Well, put me on the deck of the boat
and I'll show you.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.332
Your ship awaits.

27:21.773 --> 27:24.173
Fetch my lucky cape.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.981
Do you know why
this is my lucky cape, me old mate?

27:30.181 --> 27:34.140
Because the first time I wore it,
I sprouted a beard. A full-grown beard.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.980
Send word to every regiment...

27:36.154 --> 27:39.214
...that's still intact to gather here
at the Tyrene pass.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.960
If I'm not there in two days...

27:43.528 --> 27:45.052
...then you can pray.

27:45.964 --> 27:47.431
Your Majesty.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.060
- Regroup at the garrison!
- You can't leave...

27:51.236 --> 27:53.136
...Greece without a queen.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.439
Are you giving me orders now?

28:10.989 --> 28:12.388
Unchain him.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.356
Show me where the Fallen One is.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.364
Who is the Fallen One?

28:24.536 --> 28:27.733
Oh, the god Hephaestus.
Heh, heh.

28:29.908 --> 28:31.603
And who's Hephaestus?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.412
Hephaestus was the god
that made Poseidon's trident...

28:36.748 --> 28:38.716
...Hades' pitchfork...

28:38.883 --> 28:40.282
...and Zeus' thunderbolt.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.412
Put those together...

28:42.587 --> 28:45.886
...they form the Spear of Trium,
the weapon the gods used...

28:46.057 --> 28:47.524
...to defeat Kronos.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.751
But Hephaestus lives on the island of Kail.
Ha-ha-ha.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.396
Which no one has ever found.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.564
Kail doesn't exist, does it, Agenor?

28:58.069 --> 28:58.728
It does...

28:58.903 --> 29:00.200
...exist. I can take you.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.597
Unchain me and give me the trident.

29:02.774 --> 29:06.141
If you unchain him, he'll jump off
this boat, you'll never see him again.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.506
Hephaestus can help you save your father.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.736
Don't let our family down.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.458
Never doubted you for a second, Agenor.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.033
Great Kronos.

30:39.204 --> 30:40.228
Father.

30:40.738 --> 30:44.299
We have delivered Zeus, your son...

30:46.311 --> 30:47.471
...as you ordered.

30:48.413 --> 30:52.873
Zeus.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.889
Island of Kail.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.402
I'm not touching that again.

31:33.858 --> 31:34.916
What is it?

31:35.426 --> 31:38.884
I don't know.
But whoever did this doesn't want us here.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.087
We have no choice.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.525
Fallen god has to live as close
to the heavens as possible.

31:43.701 --> 31:44.759
Streams run through.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.733
Higher ground's that way.

32:14.832 --> 32:16.197
- What...?!
- Look!

32:16.634 --> 32:18.134
Don't move!

32:27.078 --> 32:27.976
I can't see nothing.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.171
We should pray to the god of war.
- Warriors!

32:30.348 --> 32:33.909
I know it is your custom,
but no matter what we're about to face...

32:34.085 --> 32:35.848
...you do not pray to Ares.

32:37.355 --> 32:40.347
If you do, he will find us and kill us all.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.487
Close in.

32:43.261 --> 32:44.819
Stay alert.

32:52.437 --> 32:53.734
Trip wire.

32:54.939 --> 32:56.338
- Agenor!
- Yeah, yeah. Saw it.

33:03.247 --> 33:06.045
The most important thing is to do nothing.

33:06.617 --> 33:08.107
Nothing, I can do well.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.221
Aah! For the love of Zeus!

33:13.391 --> 33:15.018
I told you to do nothing!

33:15.259 --> 33:16.283
I didn't do anything!

33:18.396 --> 33:19.556
No, no, no!

33:22.867 --> 33:23.891
Cut the counterweights.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.205
Don't cut the counterweight!

33:29.407 --> 33:31.341
Yeah, he's right, the fall will kill him.

33:44.288 --> 33:48.725
Cut the counterweight!
Cut the counterweight!

33:55.233 --> 33:55.892
Agenor!

33:57.001 --> 33:59.936
Cut the counterweight!
Cut the counterweight!

34:00.238 --> 34:01.364
Agenor!

34:05.176 --> 34:06.734
Agenor!

34:31.235 --> 34:33.226
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.536
Stay down!

34:37.375 --> 34:38.467
Ah!

34:39.643 --> 34:40.371
What is it?

34:40.844 --> 34:41.833
Big!

34:42.045 --> 34:43.536
Andromeda, slow him down!

34:56.627 --> 34:57.286
Now!

34:57.662 --> 34:59.289
Archers!

34:59.730 --> 35:00.389
Galenos...

35:00.598 --> 35:02.862
- ...give him support.
- You, follow me.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.112
No!

35:53.151 --> 35:55.210
I pray to you, great god Ares.
I pray to you...

35:55.419 --> 35:56.613
Shh.

36:03.528 --> 36:04.825
Is it gone?

36:23.514 --> 36:24.742
Hey!

36:25.349 --> 36:26.941
This is gonna be a bad idea.

37:38.956 --> 37:40.583
Where's my cousin?

37:53.170 --> 37:54.569
Glad you're hanging in there.

37:54.739 --> 37:56.764
Yeah, I thought I'd give him an eyeful.

37:58.843 --> 38:00.174
What was that for?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.978
Poseidon.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.466
Poor Ares, always...

38:29.640 --> 38:31.107
...following orders.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.210
I am my own master.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.512
Yes, of course you are.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.543
Perhaps it's only humans...

38:39.717 --> 38:40.979
...that have free will.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.318
There.

38:48.859 --> 38:51.521
Pain! Your lesson in being human.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.663
Why don't you weep?

38:53.864 --> 38:56.025
Why not weep like
your favorite son, Perseus?

38:59.670 --> 39:04.039
If I weep, it will be for you, Ares.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.170
Ares.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.043
Enough.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.470
Weep for your son!

39:11.649 --> 39:13.048
I said...

39:13.217 --> 39:14.479
...enough!

39:14.685 --> 39:16.812
We are in this together, Hades.

39:16.987 --> 39:19.148
Do not weaken now.

39:19.824 --> 39:24.158
Your weakness is your blind hatred
for your father and your brother.

39:26.831 --> 39:29.356
You don't know when to stop fighting.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.531
You've already won.

39:31.702 --> 39:35.331
Kronos is draining Zeus' power.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.450
Hephaestus.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.573
Zeus?

40:43.941 --> 40:45.499
Ares!

40:45.709 --> 40:47.472
Hades!

40:47.778 --> 40:51.214
At last! I knew you'd come.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.851
Poseidon, I can see your trident glinting.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.754
Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

41:00.157 --> 41:00.987
It's not...

41:01.158 --> 41:02.216
...them.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.427
We're looking for Hephaestus, the maker...

41:07.598 --> 41:11.125
- ...of such mighty weapons.
- Well, should I let them in?

41:11.802 --> 41:13.827
He says no!

41:15.673 --> 41:18.335
But then he always says no.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.313
He always says...

41:24.348 --> 41:25.781
...no.

41:25.983 --> 41:26.677
Ahh.

41:27.184 --> 41:28.845
Yes.

41:36.527 --> 41:38.495
You are Perseus...

41:38.863 --> 41:40.888
...son of Zeus.

41:42.466 --> 41:43.524
I am.

41:43.701 --> 41:46.261
"Release the Kraken," all of that.

41:48.138 --> 41:50.072
Yeah.
- Who are you?

41:51.275 --> 41:53.800
I'm Agenor, son of Poseidon.

41:56.046 --> 41:57.536
Agenor.

41:58.048 --> 41:59.982
Have you ever heard of Agenor?

42:00.150 --> 42:02.311
Never heard of you.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.655
Well, your friend may also
know me by the name...

42:06.690 --> 42:07.918
...the Navigator.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.087
Navigator?

42:12.530 --> 42:14.395
Navigator!

42:16.333 --> 42:17.891
Still no.

42:18.068 --> 42:21.060
Don't worry, son, he says
there are many useless demigods.

42:21.605 --> 42:25.439
"Useless"? About as useless
as your one-eyed friends.

42:25.609 --> 42:26.667
Those Cyclopes...

42:26.844 --> 42:29.438
...helped me forge the god-weapons.

42:30.447 --> 42:32.574
Have respect.

42:37.021 --> 42:38.579
"Navigator."

42:38.756 --> 42:40.223
Mm-hm.

42:41.859 --> 42:42.883
Hold on, because...

42:43.894 --> 42:47.853
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured. The words...

42:48.032 --> 42:49.522
...don't even sit together.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.565
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

42:51.735 --> 42:53.362
...so he can stop Kronos.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.532
- That's the plan, is it?
- Yeah.

42:57.708 --> 43:01.576
Right. Right. Well, in that case,
we'd best prepare.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.305
For what?
- The end of the bloody world.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.449
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

43:06.650 --> 43:09.778
You'll be scattered across the universe.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.387
Fantastic.

43:13.490 --> 43:14.957
You forged these weapons...

43:15.125 --> 43:17.889
...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

43:18.362 --> 43:20.626
Shut it! How could I...

43:20.798 --> 43:22.265
...when I've no godly power anymore?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.229
Who's he talking to?

43:23.400 --> 43:24.799
Don't you...

43:24.969 --> 43:26.231
...walk away from me.

43:26.403 --> 43:29.133
His all-powerful father
took it away from me...

43:29.373 --> 43:32.171
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.

43:32.876 --> 43:36.403
Yes, I know now it was a mistake!

43:36.580 --> 43:38.810
People forget!

43:39.750 --> 43:43.846
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

43:44.021 --> 43:47.821
...and just and strong.

43:48.258 --> 43:51.523
It were your daddy became drunk on power.

43:52.262 --> 43:54.025
We were even hoping...

43:54.198 --> 43:58.692
...when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our...

43:59.303 --> 44:02.170
Why not? He might have, had he come.

44:09.179 --> 44:09.941
I'm sorry...

44:10.114 --> 44:13.106
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...

44:13.283 --> 44:15.774
...hope when there's no hope.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.649
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.658
But sometimes, in spite...

44:22.826 --> 44:25.294
...of everything, we prevail.

44:27.564 --> 44:28.656
Now...

44:31.201 --> 44:32.566
...which of you two...

44:32.736 --> 44:34.499
...is in charge?

44:34.872 --> 44:36.066
- I am.
- Then...

44:38.475 --> 44:40.443
...if we were gods...

44:41.178 --> 44:43.840
...how would you help us free Zeus?

44:45.883 --> 44:47.180
Oh, my dear.

44:49.386 --> 44:50.751
You remind me of someone.

44:53.824 --> 44:55.451
Aphrodite.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.385
She was my wife.

45:01.198 --> 45:02.995
Come with me.

45:03.567 --> 45:05.933
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

45:06.103 --> 45:09.231
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

45:10.874 --> 45:13.741
There can't be much time
before his life force...

45:13.911 --> 45:15.037
...is completely sapped.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.043
But how do we get to him?

45:17.281 --> 45:18.578
We can't.

45:18.782 --> 45:20.613
Normally you'd be right, young man.

45:26.490 --> 45:29.550
But when I designed this marvel...

45:29.860 --> 45:32.454
...I included a secret
passage, a shortcut...

45:32.629 --> 45:33.687
...if you will.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.991
- You designed Tartarus?
- Oh, aye.

45:36.533 --> 45:38.057
And built it.

45:38.635 --> 45:40.728
Aphrodite, I could...

45:40.904 --> 45:43.202
...not only get you inside...

45:43.373 --> 45:46.740
...I could give you a guided tour.

45:51.548 --> 45:53.413
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

45:53.584 --> 45:55.814
...to be completely impregnable...

45:56.019 --> 45:58.920
...I built it from the outside in.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.922
So I had to leave a passage
for meself to get out...

46:02.092 --> 46:04.959
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

46:05.129 --> 46:08.326
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

46:08.532 --> 46:12.298
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

46:42.499 --> 46:46.492
Where's my snarling bastard of a son Ares?

46:47.104 --> 46:50.437
Will Kronos really spare him?

46:51.441 --> 46:52.135
And you?

46:54.845 --> 46:57.370
Is there no end to this?

46:58.115 --> 46:59.275
I'm afraid, brother.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.646
Is that what you want me to say?
I'm a god and I'm afraid.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.787
Well, you should be.

47:04.021 --> 47:08.583
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.

47:09.226 --> 47:12.093
When a god dies, it isn't death.

47:12.596 --> 47:14.496
It's just absence.

47:15.966 --> 47:17.228
It's nothing.

47:19.703 --> 47:21.500
It's oblivion.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.537
It's oblivion.

47:29.313 --> 47:30.837
Perseus.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.042
<i>Perseus.</i>

47:37.221 --> 47:38.688
Father.

47:40.924 --> 47:42.551
I'm close.

47:42.926 --> 47:44.518
Stay with me.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.387
You see, if you align
the edges correctly...

47:47.564 --> 47:50.260
...it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.229
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

47:52.402 --> 47:54.233
Well, useful to a point.

47:54.438 --> 47:56.998
- Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
- No.

47:57.174 --> 48:00.405
Well, you are the son of Poseidon.

48:00.744 --> 48:05.113
He's the one who taught me to navigate.
That, and how to seduce a mermaid...

48:05.282 --> 48:07.682
...which seemed random,
but came in handy more often...

48:07.851 --> 48:10.217
...than you'd think. Thing to do is...

48:10.387 --> 48:13.220
...don't talk to her, talk to her friend.

48:16.793 --> 48:19.921
<i>Navigator, this is the entrance
to the labyrinth.</i>

48:20.097 --> 48:24.227
<i>There are hundreds of doors,
all of which would kill you...</i>

48:25.168 --> 48:27.102
<i>...save one. You see...</i>

48:27.271 --> 48:28.704
...I designed it to play...

48:28.872 --> 48:31.272
...tricks with the mind.
After all, the mind...

48:31.441 --> 48:32.931
...is the greatest trap of all.

48:33.110 --> 48:36.079
So you've got to control your fears...

48:36.246 --> 48:38.737
...so you don't turn on yourself
or each other...

48:38.916 --> 48:41.111
...if you wanna make it to Tartarus.

48:48.926 --> 48:49.585
There it is.

48:50.227 --> 48:51.956
There's our door.

48:55.966 --> 48:57.593
Everybody back!

49:07.711 --> 49:08.405
Oh.

49:08.946 --> 49:11.073
Which one of you prayed to him?!

49:43.013 --> 49:44.139
You betrayed our father.

49:45.115 --> 49:46.878
He betrayed me...

49:48.151 --> 49:49.175
...by choosing you.

50:17.381 --> 50:19.144
You beauty!

50:21.418 --> 50:23.682
Come on! It won't stay open...

50:23.854 --> 50:24.878
...for long!

50:36.066 --> 50:38.227
No, not now!

50:49.846 --> 50:50.608
Great god Ares...

50:50.814 --> 50:53.681
...be merciful. It was I who prayed
to you. I was taught...

50:54.251 --> 50:57.049
...to pray for my enemies.
I prayed you would find peace...

50:57.220 --> 50:59.450
...in your hear... Ah! Ah!

51:05.896 --> 51:06.760
We are brothers...

51:07.431 --> 51:08.557
...but not equal.

51:13.336 --> 51:16.396
I have got to give them more time.

51:25.615 --> 51:28.641
One last godly thing.

51:28.852 --> 51:29.910
Come on!

51:30.587 --> 51:32.885
Let's see what you blee...!

51:34.091 --> 51:34.989
Perseus!

51:37.594 --> 51:38.583
Hephaestus.

51:38.862 --> 51:39.590
Aah!

51:42.866 --> 51:43.764
Perseus! The door's...

51:43.934 --> 51:45.299
- ...closing!
- Come on!

51:45.469 --> 51:46.561
Ares!

51:47.604 --> 51:49.435
Is that all you got...

51:49.606 --> 51:50.573
...you sniveling...

51:51.475 --> 51:52.499
...dog?

51:53.777 --> 51:54.801
Get to the door!

51:56.113 --> 51:58.113
- Come on!
- Come on!

52:21.204 --> 52:22.899
Oh, Korrina.

52:24.174 --> 52:26.665
She was a fool to pray to him...

52:27.844 --> 52:30.870
...and he was a coward to kill the weak.

52:31.047 --> 52:33.641
He has fought in many wars.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.011
He's slaughtered innocents for centuries.

52:36.953 --> 52:37.612
It's all...

52:37.787 --> 52:38.811
...he knows.

52:40.423 --> 52:41.549
I can't beat him.

52:42.325 --> 52:43.314
Mutton head.

52:43.527 --> 52:47.054
Two days ago I was trapped in a cell
in a dungeon, admittedly...

52:47.230 --> 52:50.358
...trying to escape,
unbecoming of the son of Poseidon.

52:51.201 --> 52:55.035
But today I'm here,
and I'm trying to save the universe.

52:55.472 --> 52:56.734
Jump in.

53:06.349 --> 53:07.577
Your Majesty...

53:07.751 --> 53:11.084
...I realize in a labyrinth
with a million possibilities...

53:11.254 --> 53:13.381
...this is the last thing
you want to hear...

53:15.025 --> 53:16.458
...but follow me.

53:21.464 --> 53:22.829
That way.

53:26.970 --> 53:28.403
Or this way.

53:48.024 --> 53:48.683
I don't know...

53:48.858 --> 53:50.883
...how we'll get through this
without Hephaestus.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.130
<i>Perseus.</i>

54:04.307 --> 54:06.241
<i>Where is your son?</i>

54:17.085 --> 54:18.882
<i>This way.</i>

54:25.027 --> 54:26.289
That way.

54:48.617 --> 54:50.050
This way!

55:00.095 --> 55:01.585
Andromeda.

55:03.298 --> 55:04.765
Korrina.

55:05.667 --> 55:07.430
You must turn back.

55:15.611 --> 55:16.441
This should be...

55:16.612 --> 55:18.773
...a corridor. This map makes no sense.

55:18.981 --> 55:20.505
<i>Andromeda.</i>

55:24.486 --> 55:26.386
There's something in here with us.

55:28.390 --> 55:30.858
- Just give me the map.
- No.

55:31.126 --> 55:33.686
The mighty Kraken slayer.
Shouldn't he be somewhere...

55:33.862 --> 55:35.523
- ...posing for a statue?
- Agenor...

55:35.697 --> 55:38.666
- ...just give me the map!
- The map is useless!

55:47.342 --> 55:48.331
This way!

55:54.116 --> 55:54.844
Agenor!

55:57.719 --> 55:59.516
I know where we're going!

56:06.328 --> 56:07.625
This way!

56:18.540 --> 56:19.700
Get back!

56:28.750 --> 56:29.409
Back!

56:36.525 --> 56:37.549
Get up!

56:50.238 --> 56:50.966
Andromeda!

56:57.279 --> 56:58.303
Yes.

57:09.391 --> 57:10.881
Take the weight!

57:16.565 --> 57:18.328
Come on, come on, come on!

57:22.004 --> 57:23.335
Go, go!

57:23.739 --> 57:25.001
Go!

58:11.153 --> 58:12.882
It's cold in here, isn't it?

58:29.504 --> 58:31.335
You're not real.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.535
Helius?

01:00:01.997 --> 01:00:05.899
Why are
you doing this? Please, Dad, don't kill me.

01:01:06.027 --> 01:01:08.325
- Perseus!
- Perseus.

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:10.059
What happened?

01:01:16.638 --> 01:01:17.627
Tartarus.

01:01:20.508 --> 01:01:21.497
Come on, let's go.

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:23.641
Come on.

01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:36.482
Kronos has his power now.

01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:39.351
Hades.

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:43.263
I am so sorry.

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:45.257
For what?

01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:47.491
For having banished you.

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:51.400
Can you forgive me for that?

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.167
Why do you ask?

01:01:55.777 --> 01:01:58.473
Because I forgive you for this.

01:02:00.415 --> 01:02:02.508
Release me, Hades.

01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:05.209
I know there is still good in you.

01:02:14.095 --> 01:02:15.995
You have no pride, Hades.

01:02:17.032 --> 01:02:18.192
No.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.362
I won't let you kill him.

01:02:23.271 --> 01:02:24.499
Brother.

01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:29.610
You can't stop this.

01:02:46.594 --> 01:02:47.891
Ares!

01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:21.091
Come on.

01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:29.702
Go, go!

01:03:35.076 --> 01:03:36.941
Father. Father!

01:03:37.512 --> 01:03:38.342
Father!

01:03:38.513 --> 01:03:39.673
Open your eyes!

01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:43.206
Perseus.

01:03:44.486 --> 01:03:46.511
Perseus, my son.

01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.899
Use the power inside you.

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:33.762
Perseus...

01:04:33.935 --> 01:04:34.629
...hurry!

01:04:59.427 --> 01:05:01.019
Ares!
- Andromeda!

01:05:18.713 --> 01:05:19.611
Hades...

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:20.805
...come with us.

01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:47.805
No!

01:05:50.478 --> 01:05:52.139
Hades.

01:06:00.955 --> 01:06:02.786
Weapon. Give it to me.

01:06:04.325 --> 01:06:05.622
Hold them.

01:06:40.028 --> 01:06:40.960
Mantius, impressive.

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:44.798
- You gathered a fine army.
- I have prepared a royal tent.

01:06:44.966 --> 01:06:46.558
And is it fit for a god?

01:06:47.202 --> 01:06:48.794
Great Zeus.
- Great Zeus.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.460
Great Zeus.

01:06:56.578 --> 01:06:57.237
Kronos...

01:06:57.412 --> 01:07:00.210
...will come for me, Perseus.

01:07:00.582 --> 01:07:02.982
I don't have the power left to stop him.

01:07:06.054 --> 01:07:07.078
I wanted...

01:07:07.288 --> 01:07:09.688
...to leave the world safe for you.
I failed.

01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:12.755
I should have come with you.

01:07:12.927 --> 01:07:14.417
- I was just...
- You pulled me...

01:07:14.596 --> 01:07:16.496
...out of Tartarus.

01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:19.162
You saved me.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:22.803
How do you suppose you did that?

01:07:23.705 --> 01:07:26.765
I never stopped thinking about
getting home to my son.

01:07:26.941 --> 01:07:29.808
Then you use that. Fight for your son.

01:07:30.845 --> 01:07:32.107
Remember:

01:07:33.014 --> 01:07:35.949
Only the Spear of Trium can defeat Kronos.

01:07:36.117 --> 01:07:38.677
And the hand that holds that spear
will have to be...

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:39.911
...yours.

01:07:46.227 --> 01:07:48.821
We have two pieces of the Spear of Trium.

01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:51.860
Poseidon's trident...

01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:54.728
...and Hades' pitchfork.

01:07:54.902 --> 01:07:57.234
So, what we need is Zeus' thunderbolt.

01:07:57.405 --> 01:07:58.929
Which is on Ares' back.

01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.136
Yep.

01:08:05.146 --> 01:08:06.272
<i>Ares.</i>

01:08:07.482 --> 01:08:08.972
<i>Ares.</i>

01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:10.775
<i>Ares.</i>

01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:13.150
<i>Brother.</i>

01:08:15.089 --> 01:08:16.886
I pray to you.

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:20.660
Meet me at the temple of the gods.

01:08:23.163 --> 01:08:25.098
<i>You say we're not equal.</i>

01:08:27.602 --> 01:08:28.830
<i>So come prove to me...</i>

01:08:29.002 --> 01:08:29.992
<i>...you're right.</i>

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.769
<i>Prove to our father that you're right.</i>

01:08:38.746 --> 01:08:40.509
I hear you, brother.

01:08:47.822 --> 01:08:49.517
I'll get the spear. You hold him off.

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:57.761
Don't give me the big speech.

01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:00.466
Yeah, I wasn't planning to.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:24.787
<i>Our battle plan...</i>

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:26.484
...must be simple.

01:09:26.794 --> 01:09:28.158
Three lines of defense:

01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:30.388
Agenor's men will hold the front line...

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:31.657
<i>...from the trenches.</i>

01:09:31.832 --> 01:09:32.697
Cover every part...

01:09:32.867 --> 01:09:34.663
...of yourself, or you'll be burned...

01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:35.962
...by the fire.

01:09:36.136 --> 01:09:37.798
Every piece of cloth...

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:40.466
...every piece of skin. Help each other.

01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:41.801
Phalanxes behind that...

01:09:41.975 --> 01:09:44.069
...and infantry as the last defense.

01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:46.437
<i>I will lead the infantry myself.</i>

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:48.408
<i>And our job...</i>

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:51.848
...is to hold Kronos back
for as long as possible...

01:09:52.019 --> 01:09:54.145
...if we're to stand a chance.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.824
- Dig in!
- Position!

01:10:00.094 --> 01:10:01.584
Secure positions!

01:10:46.073 --> 01:10:47.734
Kronos is near.

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.553
Makhai!

01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:06.019
Makhai!

01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:19.804
Light the fires!

01:11:20.107 --> 01:11:23.304
- Light the fires!
- Light the fires!

01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:27.771
Hold!

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:35.178
Fire the artillery!

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.679
Loose!

01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:40.424
Fire!

01:12:14.095 --> 01:12:15.528
Brother.

01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:28.870
Brother.

01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:34.513
- Please don't hurt him.
- I'm not going to hurt him.

01:12:34.715 --> 01:12:36.182
I'm going to hurt you.

01:12:37.318 --> 01:12:38.512
And I want him to watch.

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:41.044
I want you to know...

01:12:41.722 --> 01:12:43.246
...what it feels like...

01:12:43.424 --> 01:12:47.224
...when someone takes your father away
from you.

01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:13.741
Front line, attack!

01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:15.212
Stay with me!

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.408
Stand firm!

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:14.197
So this is what a father...

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:16.536
...would go through for his son?

01:15:44.038 --> 01:15:45.369
Brother.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:49.039
Brother.

01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:52.045
I do...

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.841
...forgive you.

01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:19.064
You look...

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.470
...10,000 years younger.

01:16:21.942 --> 01:16:23.102
And feel it.

01:16:28.482 --> 01:16:31.383
Death was circling you.

01:16:31.886 --> 01:16:35.117
That was the last time
I'll have the strength to chase it away.

01:16:37.224 --> 01:16:38.122
We have the power...

01:16:38.292 --> 01:16:41.955
...between us to put on a little display.

01:16:42.129 --> 01:16:43.118
Like in the old days.

01:16:44.098 --> 01:16:45.395
So shall we finish this?

01:16:45.566 --> 01:16:46.464
We have no weapons.

01:16:46.634 --> 01:16:48.465
We had power before we had weapons.

01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:50.433
- When we were young gods.
- Yes.

01:16:51.472 --> 01:16:52.496
Let's have some fun!

01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:18.047
Helius. Weapons!

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:38.835
Hold the line! Hold the line!

01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:40.267
Stand firm!

01:19:55.556 --> 01:19:56.784
The Spear of Trium.

01:20:10.704 --> 01:20:14.663
Hades.

01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:21.843
Zeus.

01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:24.107
The first strike's mine, brother.

01:21:02.156 --> 01:21:03.316
Perseus!

01:22:13.894 --> 01:22:15.327
Together now, brother!

01:22:33.714 --> 01:22:36.774
This is it, boy.
They've given us a chance.

01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:04.375
Brother!

01:24:07.307 --> 01:24:08.899
Come on, stand up!

01:24:22.589 --> 01:24:26.047
<i>Perseus! Perseus! Perseus!</i>

01:25:00.927 --> 01:25:02.758
He's waiting for you...

01:25:04.164 --> 01:25:05.961
...before he goes.

01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:30.151
Your boy gave you strength.

01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:32.652
Yes.

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:35.590
As did mine.

01:25:40.434 --> 01:25:42.629
Perhaps Hades can heal you.

01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:45.164
He already gave me my last chance.

01:25:50.477 --> 01:25:52.809
And you sacrificed it for him.

01:25:54.348 --> 01:25:57.010
There will be no more sacrifices.

01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:00.719
No more gods.

01:26:05.726 --> 01:26:08.991
Use your power wisely, Perseus.

01:26:27.013 --> 01:26:29.880
Thank you, my son.

01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:01.840
All my power is spent.

01:27:05.485 --> 01:27:06.918
Who knows?

01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:11.217
I might be stronger without it.

01:27:26.006 --> 01:27:28.736
I know it's broke. No need to tell me.

01:27:28.942 --> 01:27:31.308
I could walk on it, but....
My mum always said...

01:27:31.511 --> 01:27:34.742
...you should let everyone have
their moment to shine. You know?

01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:37.884
So, you know, I'm established.
I've already got a name.

01:27:38.051 --> 01:27:40.611
You know? The Navigator.

01:27:43.323 --> 01:27:44.915
If I'm not mistaken...

01:27:45.625 --> 01:27:48.560
- ...you're the son of Perseus.
- I am Helius.

01:27:48.762 --> 01:27:51.128
Is that your boy, Helius?

01:28:00.273 --> 01:28:01.535
Go over there!

01:28:03.443 --> 01:28:04.432
Helius!

01:28:05.178 --> 01:28:05.974
Come here.

01:28:06.146 --> 01:28:08.307
I've got a story to tell. Come and meet...

01:28:08.482 --> 01:28:10.143
...your Uncle Navigator.

01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:21.593
I'm Agenor.

01:28:21.928 --> 01:28:23.259
Helius.

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.695
I've read that you are
a great disappointment.

01:28:27.133 --> 01:28:29.101
That's right, I am great.

01:28:29.269 --> 01:28:31.294
This is my nurse, Tiger.

01:28:45.385 --> 01:28:47.649
We have to be prepared
if there's another attack.

01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:49.982
We're fortifying Argos
with the third regiment.

01:28:50.156 --> 01:28:53.284
Our engines will be ready in two days,
so in the west we can...

01:29:12.412 --> 01:29:13.640
Dad...

01:29:14.548 --> 01:29:17.210
...I'm actually looking forward
to going home.

01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:22.216
I've decided being a boring fisherman
isn't that bad.

01:29:23.056 --> 01:29:25.183
You know we can't go back home.

01:29:42.142 --> 01:29:43.370
Take it.

01:29:48.348 --> 01:29:49.906
You're Helius.

01:29:52.052 --> 01:29:53.917
You're son of Perseus...

01:29:54.354 --> 01:29:56.345
...the grandson of Zeus.

01:29:59.526 --> 01:30:00.720
Take it.

01:30:11.705 --> 01:30:13.036
It's heavy.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.605
Yeah, it is.

01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:19.903
Is it too much?

01:30:27.454 --> 01:30:28.716
No.
