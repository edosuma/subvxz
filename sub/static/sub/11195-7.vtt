WEBVTT

00:06.215 --> 00:08.759
The MALP readings indicate
a very low UV level.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.845
All other indications
suggest a positive environment.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.889
Sounds good.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.934
It'll take two weeks
to fully transplant the Enkarans.

00:17.017 --> 00:22.439
- If the planet proves to be suitable.
- It better be. They're running out of time.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.947
(Stargate alarm)

00:32.908 --> 00:35.452
Chevron seven won't engage.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.671
I don't understand it.
The diagnostic shows no problems.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.177
Sir, this is gonna take a while.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.604
There was an energy spike
in our power log...

01:02.688 --> 01:05.147
..eight minutes before
we tried dialling out.

01:05.232 --> 01:09.152
Haven't we seen that before, when
another gate is being used on Earth?

01:09.278 --> 01:12.364
Like when Maybourne's NID guys
had the other gate?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.158
There is no longer
a second Stargate on Earth.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.452
Ours was destroyed with Thor's ship.

01:17.536 --> 01:20.956
If there was another gate
and its use caused the energy spike,...

01:21.039 --> 01:26.170
..there might be a seismic tremor, like
when the gate was found in Antarctica.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.047
(technician) I've got something.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.968
There was a minor seismic event...

01:33.093 --> 01:36.847
..that matches the time
in our power log exactly.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.393
Is that Siberia?

01:42.227 --> 01:46.356
Yes, sir. And there's only
one explanation I can think of.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.901
The Russians have a Stargate?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074

02:56.426 --> 03:00.347
The Russians recovered the Stargate
from the bottom of the ocean.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.724
I thought we swept that entire area.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.561
It was hundreds of square miles, Colonel.

03:05.644 --> 03:10.023
The Russian navy was on alert because
they picked up Thor's ship on satellite.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.402
- They must've beat us to it.
- And they're admitting it?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.613
We didn't give them much choice, Major.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.867
The Pentagon said we had
the evidence that could prove it.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.370
- Obviously they figured out how it works.
- It took us years.

03:23.495 --> 03:27.499
Apparently the Russians
know quite a bit about the SGC.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.877
- How?
- They didn't say.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.673
How they got it open isn't the issue now.
The problem is it won't close.

03:35.382 --> 03:39.052
That doesn't make any sense.
Shouldn't it shut down on its own?

03:39.178 --> 03:42.764
Even the Goa'uld have not sustained
a wormhole for over 38 minutes.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.853
- What about another black-hole planet?
- We'd detect the gravitational anomaly.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.898
The Russians are divided on this.

03:50.981 --> 03:55.944
The Russian president didn't support
setting up a Stargate programme initially.

03:56.028 --> 04:00.991
Until we called, they were planning on
bombing the facility and covering it up.

04:01.116 --> 04:05.162
- And now?
- One of the Russian scientists involved...

04:05.245 --> 04:08.749
..convinced them to send in a team
to assess the situation...

04:08.832 --> 04:12.169
..and determine if it can
be resolved in another way.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.005
- Who's the scientist?
- Dr Svetlana Markov.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.591
Wow. I know her work. She's brilliant.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.136
She knows about you, too, Major.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.555
To that end, she's convinced Moscow...

04:23.680 --> 04:25.724
..to let SG-1 be the team...

04:25.849 --> 04:28.143
..that goes to Siberia.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.604
- You're kidding.
- They're smart enough...

04:30.729 --> 04:33.273
..to realise this has global implications...

04:33.357 --> 04:36.443
..and that you are
the foremost experts on the Stargate.

04:36.568 --> 04:40.489
We'd be walking into an unknown
situation to save their rosy butts.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.617
We can't use our gate
till we get theirs shut down.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.161
Not to mention the danger
of an open wormhole...

04:46.245 --> 04:48.372
..between Earth and... who knows where?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.791
You'll meet with Dr Markov in Russia...

04:50.874 --> 04:53.418
..and proceed to the base from there.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.912
Dr Markov, I presume.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.416
- Sorry I'm late.
- (Carter) Doctor, it's an honour.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.836
- I've read your work.
- And I yours, Major Carter.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.131
I had hoped we would meet
under different circumstances.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.592
Jack O'Neill.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.844
Yes.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.639
And... Dr Daniel Jackson, and Teal'c.

05:48.932 --> 05:53.896
- How do you know about the SGC?
- I have read extensive files on all of you.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.898
The question was... how?

05:56.023 --> 06:00.402
I learned to read English at the age of six.
It is not difficult.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.030
Russian humour.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.908
I will tell you what I can on the way.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.933
I was first contacted shortly after
Russian satellites picked up...

06:31.016 --> 06:35.562
..what we believed was an alien
spaceship entering the atmosphere.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.774
- Alien spaceship, huh?
- About two months ago.

06:38.857 --> 06:42.945
It disintegrated during entry
and crashed in the Pacific.

06:43.028 --> 06:47.199
The Stargate was recovered after
an extensive sweep of the ocean floor.

06:47.282 --> 06:51.495
During that search, one of our
Foxtrot submarines went missing.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.373
You may be familiar with the incident.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.500
Not a clue.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.713
I was assigned to the programme
as chief science officer,...

07:01.797 --> 07:04.424
..second in command to Colonel Sokalov.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.177
We've been in operation for 37 days,...

07:07.553 --> 07:12.599
..albeit against the wishes of certain
very powerful people in the government.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.477
What did theywanna do?

07:16.395 --> 07:20.065
They threatened to expose
the existence of your programme.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.859
To what end?

07:21.984 --> 07:25.737
To get the US to share
the technology you have attained.

07:27.281 --> 07:31.034
- So what stopped them?
- We activated our gate.

07:31.159 --> 07:35.706
I convinced the military that we could
benefit from our own programme...

07:35.831 --> 07:38.625
..more than we could trust you.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.960
Ah.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.796
How did you activate it?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.883
We have a dialling device.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.969
A DHD.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.096
You found the one from Giza.

07:51.221 --> 07:56.185
It was confiscated from the Germans
after the Second World War.

07:56.268 --> 08:01.064
Now I understand how you can return
your people to your gate instead of ours.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.859
That makes one of us.

08:03.942 --> 08:08.989
Our gate superseded yours as long as
the dialling device was connected.

08:09.072 --> 08:13.535
We only kept it connected when we were
using it to prevent any crossover.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.371
It required precise timing, but it worked.

08:16.455 --> 08:20.209
- Till now.
- As for the current situation,...

08:20.334 --> 08:22.961
..l really don't know what has happened.

08:23.045 --> 08:27.674
There has been no contact with the base
since yesterday at 1200 hours.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.762
Sir, we have a visual
of the target runway.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.682
It appears to be iced over. There's
no response from the control tower.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.726
We're going to have to jump.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.938
Out of the plane?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.985
I'm going with or without you, Colonel.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.741
I suppose you expect my male bravado
to kick in right about now.

08:52.991 --> 08:56.578
- I've read your file.
- No mention of bravado, eh?

08:58.413 --> 09:02.084
There are 47 people down there
who may need our help.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.923
Look. You don't have to tell me
what's at stake here.

09:08.006 --> 09:13.428
We have seven teams off world who can't
get home till we fix what you screwed up.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.023
Stu?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.276
Gear 'em up.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.444
For a jump.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.499
- I do not understand, O'Neill.
- It's called a parachute.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.836
It slows your descent
after you jump out of the plane.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.256
This device seems to be
poorly designed for such a function.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.508
It opens after you jump.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.930
Don't worry. I've done it
hundreds of times.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.558
I assume you brought hazmat.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.352
Yeah.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.314
We thought somebody
should be prepared.

10:07.608 --> 10:11.987
- Is he always like this?
- Actually, this is quite charming.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.341
Gear's away, sir!

10:36.470 --> 10:40.224
It's easy! Just jump, and pull this.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.726
This does not seem wise, O'Neill.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.895
I said it was easy, not wise.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.858
If we get separated,
we'll rendezvous at the base.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.162
This does not seem wise.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.139
(O'Neill) Teal'c? Daniel? Come in.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.562
There's no response on the radios.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.941
(Markov) Their signals may be blocked
if they are already inside.

11:43.078 --> 11:47.207
- (Markov) Up there.
- (O'Neill) Teal'c, Daniel, do you read?

11:47.291 --> 11:50.210
- (Teal'c) I am here.
- Where?

11:50.294 --> 11:53.630
- In the facility.
- (Daniel) Yeah, I'm here, too.

11:54.756 --> 11:59.219
- Where?
- I don't know exactly. Where are you?

11:59.303 --> 12:01.763
We just got inside. Hang tight.

12:10.606 --> 12:14.026
(Carter) I'm picking up
trace amounts of chlorine.

12:14.151 --> 12:18.071
- (O'Neill) Yeah?
- Nothing dangerous at these levels, sir.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.369
(O'Neill) What is this place?

12:24.453 --> 12:28.123
(Carter) It obviously wasn't built
for your Stargate programme.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.460
(Markov) It was
an experimental power station.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.463
- (Carter) Experimental?
- All I'm allowed to say is...

12:34.546 --> 12:38.717
- ..it was decommissioned two years ago.
- (O'Neill) Oh, please!

12:39.676 --> 12:42.846
- (Carter) Are there lights?
- Power seems to be diverted...

12:42.930 --> 12:45.724
..from all nonessential base functions.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.101
This way to the main control centre.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.529
- Daniel, is that you?
- I don't know.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.031
I'm heading down a long corridor.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.117
Which one?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.746
This one.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.377
(Markov) This way.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.171
Actually, you might wanna see this first.

13:26.223 --> 13:30.602
(Teal'c) These three were shot.
I am unaware of how these others died.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.065
(Markov) These doors
lead to the Stargate.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.994
(clicking)

14:13.061 --> 14:15.105
They're all dead.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.462
(Markov) I need this station.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.361
It's safe.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.119
The air is indeed clean.

15:23.841 --> 15:27.344
- Are you OK?
- I knew these men and women, Major.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.056
Some of them quite well.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.353
What happened here?

15:36.478 --> 15:40.315
Colonel Sokalov enacted
the Extreme Measures Protocol.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.486
- What's that?
- The Stargate room is sealed...

15:44.611 --> 15:48.365
..and Substance 35
is released throughout the base.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.450
Nerve gas?

15:50.534 --> 15:53.203
- Nerve gas?!
- It's OK, Colonel.

15:53.287 --> 15:57.666
It's a nonpersistent gas.
It evaporates after three hours.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.712
According to the computer,
the protocol was enacted yesterday.

16:01.795 --> 16:06.049
- For what reason?
- The computer log doesn't say.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.971
People were shootin' each other before
they got gassed. I wanna know why.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.515
We'll see what we can find out.

16:14.975 --> 16:19.438
This is a list of all personnel
assigned to the base.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.816
They should all be wearing ID tags.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.117
So, what about the gate?

16:32.201 --> 16:35.120
It's an outgoing wormhole, but...

16:36.997 --> 16:39.041
..that doesn't make sense.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.712
The EM Protocol
cuts off the dialling device.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.633
If the protocol was enacted yesterday,...

16:47.716 --> 16:52.179
..where has the outgoing wormhole
been drawing its power from since then?

16:52.304 --> 16:55.641
We've seen one draw power
from a source at the destination.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.018
Of course. The black-hole incident.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.398
Is there anything you don't know?

17:03.482 --> 17:05.776
What were they doing?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.211
(sighs)

17:24.294 --> 17:26.338
It's gone.

17:28.131 --> 17:32.678
If I ask what, and you say it's classified,
I'm gonna shoot you.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.140
The seventh address
we successfully dialled...

17:37.266 --> 17:40.853
..led to a Stargate
entirely submerged underwater.

17:41.603 --> 17:45.357
We sent a reconnaissance drone
and found the dialling device.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.903
So it was decided that the manned
mini-submarine would go next.

17:51.029 --> 17:56.326
A sample of the water was retrieved. It
seemed to have unbelievable properties.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.370
Like what?

17:58.453 --> 18:02.749
It was spontaneously
emitting energy in the form of heat.

18:03.792 --> 18:08.088
If this liquid turned out to be
an abundant, clean energy source...

18:08.172 --> 18:09.965
That doesn't seem possible.

18:10.048 --> 18:14.344
I was called away to Moscow before I
could perform any significant analysis.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.598
So now you're saying
the water sample is gone?

18:17.681 --> 18:19.808
Yes.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.979
There was a sealed container
being kept in this containment vessel.

18:24.062 --> 18:28.317
And the Stargate is
dialled into the water planet now?

18:28.400 --> 18:32.446
Apparently, but that doesn't make sense.

18:32.529 --> 18:37.409
They were supposed to go on to the next
two planets on our planned sequence...

18:37.493 --> 18:40.662
..and not revisit the water planet
until I got back.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.666
Let's confirm it. Do you have
another reconnaissance drone?

18:44.750 --> 18:49.630
We left the first one there. All we have
to do is reactivate the receiver.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.933
- (O'Neill overradio) Daniel, Teal'c.
- What's up?

19:01.058 --> 19:05.687
Head back to the control room. DrMarkov
thinks you might wanna see this.

19:10.734 --> 19:14.154
(Teal'c) We have accounted for
28 of the 47 numbers on the list.

19:14.279 --> 19:19.952
Six were civilians, not soldiers. They
were all shot for no apparent reason.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.746
They were the scientists
working in the lab.

19:22.830 --> 19:27.292
So the guys experimenting on that water
gave the soldiers reason to shoot 'em.

19:27.376 --> 19:29.670
So it seems.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.296
What water?

19:31.380 --> 19:35.133
It was a sample from the planet
where the Stargate is submerged.

19:35.259 --> 19:38.262
I thought you might
be interested, Dr Jackson.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.430
We found some unusual ruins...

19:40.556 --> 19:44.935
..from an obviously extinct
civilisation on the ocean's floor.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.397
Decoding signal from
the reconnaissance drone.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.110
Can you get closer?

19:54.027 --> 19:58.073
The drone is malfunctioning.
I can only pan and tilt.

20:07.040 --> 20:12.254
Why would they go through the Stargate
knowing they'd drown on the other side?

20:17.009 --> 20:19.845
Can you shut off
the drone's transmitter from here?

20:19.928 --> 20:20.929
Why?

20:21.054 --> 20:23.765
The wormhole only allows
matter to travel one way.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.226
But we can send radio signals
back and forth.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.980
You think the drone's transmitter
is what's keeping the gate open?

20:30.063 --> 20:34.067
That gate won't close if the drone is
aiming a signal into the event horizon.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.528
And the energy
being emitted by the water...

20:36.612 --> 20:39.072
..has allowed the gate
to stay open this long.

20:39.156 --> 20:43.535
Exactly. It's a combination of factors,
but all we have to do is shut off the drone.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.496
(typing)

20:47.039 --> 20:50.626
It's not responding to my command.
I can't shut it down.

20:52.336 --> 20:56.882
- How long before its batteries die?
- The drone is nuclear-powered.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.512
- A nuclear-powered drone?
- We built several of them.

21:01.595 --> 21:06.642
We thought we might leave them on
other planets for long-term observation.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.144
How long-term?

21:11.188 --> 21:13.565
Ten years.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.700
It will be simple to deactivate the drone
from the other side.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.371
Once the signal stops,
the wormhole should close.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.540
I'd like a closer look at those ruins.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.668
- How many people does that thing hold?
- Three.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.837
Oh, dang.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.173
I've never been in a submarine before.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.237
(hatch shuts)

22:03.907 --> 22:06.451
Spacious, roomy. Very nice.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.166
So exactly how much air
do we have in this thing?

22:12.249 --> 22:16.003
Over a day's worth.
We won't need more than an hour.

22:25.053 --> 22:28.390
- Colonel, can you hearus?
- Yeah, I read you.

22:28.849 --> 22:32.936
Pressurising and...
proceeding through the gate.

22:55.167 --> 22:58.420
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.952
- (Carter) Wow.
- It is quite beautiful.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.246
- What?
- The rapid pressurisation...

23:32.371 --> 23:34.832
..might cause your ears to block.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.253
As you might notice,
there is no plant or animal life.

23:40.379 --> 23:43.215
Doesn't appear to be
any plant or animal life.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.342
Colonel, do you read?

23:46.593 --> 23:47.678
Yeah.

23:47.803 --> 23:50.639
We're counting fiive bodies on this side.

23:50.722 --> 23:55.185
Which means there could still be
several personnel unaccounted for.

23:56.270 --> 24:00.440
- All right, we'll have another look around.
- We're capturing the drone.

24:00.524 --> 24:03.777
Once it is inside the containment tank,
we can deactivate it.

24:03.902 --> 24:06.446
And, ifMajor Carteris right,...

24:06.530 --> 24:08.907
..the gate will shut off.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.078
Ending transmission. Overand out.

24:22.004 --> 24:24.464
So let's have that look around.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.744
I'm glad you were right, Major.

24:53.869 --> 24:58.916
It doesn't explain why your soldiers shot
the scientists experimenting on the water.

24:58.999 --> 25:02.753
Or why those men were either
forced through the gate...

25:02.836 --> 25:07.299
..or felt compelled to go through
on their own, knowing they would die.

25:08.634 --> 25:12.054
The ruins suggest the planet
wasn't always submerged.

25:12.179 --> 25:16.099
- Maybe there are some clues down there.
- Let's have a look.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.977
(engines whir)

25:21.730 --> 25:25.859
- Is something wrong?
- The controls are getting heavy.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.322
I haven't touched the power,
yet we're slowing down.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.950
- Strong current?
- It's possible.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.662
I'm pushing it to full power.

25:46.296 --> 25:50.217
- What's that smell?
- We've completely stopped.

25:51.969 --> 25:54.429
- Uh, fire.
- Extinguisher.

26:08.277 --> 26:10.654
It's out. We're OK.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.622
Can you fix it?

26:20.747 --> 26:22.624
Yes.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.722
What?

26:36.805 --> 26:40.225
If it was a strong current,
it should be pushing us backwards.

26:40.309 --> 26:43.979
- But it's not.
- No. We're completely stationary.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.148
It's like we're stuck in the mud.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.277
Without the mud.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.842
What's that smell?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.203
Holy frozen bad guys.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.510
- How's it going?
- I think I can fix it.

28:40.554 --> 28:44.933
Five minutes ago you said you definitely
could fix it. Now you just think you can?

28:45.017 --> 28:47.227
What do you want to hear?

28:47.311 --> 28:49.855
I don't understand why this happened.

28:50.439 --> 28:54.651
No, given the obvious solid craftsmanship
that went into this thing(!)

28:54.735 --> 28:58.572
If you're implying that everything
Russian-made is of poor quality,...

28:58.697 --> 29:01.241
..actually, the sub is Swiss.

29:02.201 --> 29:06.038
So they occasionally catch fire
but they keep perfect time.

29:09.041 --> 29:13.212
Sorry. I think I've been
hangin' around Jack O'Neill too much.

29:16.173 --> 29:19.259
There was nothing impeding us.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.386
This shouldn't have happened.

29:21.512 --> 29:26.725
Something else shouldn't be happening:
the outside pressure is increasing.

29:27.392 --> 29:29.436
What?

29:33.482 --> 29:36.985
- The gauge must be malfunctioning.
- But it's Swiss.

29:37.069 --> 29:41.532
Our depth is constant, and pressure
should be relative to depth.

29:41.615 --> 29:44.076
And if it keeps increasing?

29:45.452 --> 29:48.163
The sub will implode.

30:11.228 --> 30:14.731
We know how the Russians
acquired their information.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.533
Solid.

30:25.242 --> 30:27.911
Whoa! Whoa.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.373
Do not humans usually die
when they are frozen?

30:31.498 --> 30:33.292
Usually.

30:37.921 --> 30:41.508
They usually don't breathe
when they're dead either.

30:45.345 --> 30:49.183
So, Svetlana, could you go over
exactly what happened...

30:49.308 --> 30:51.351
..the last time you were here?

30:52.352 --> 30:55.856
We came through the Stargate,
just as we did this time.

30:55.939 --> 30:59.860
We took the sub straight to
the dialling device and redialled Earth.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.779
The gate opened and we headed through.

31:02.863 --> 31:05.157
That's it?

31:05.240 --> 31:10.287
We collected the water sample just before
heading back through the event horizon.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.498
No trouble?

31:12.623 --> 31:16.293
We had to push the engines a little harder
to get through the gate,...

31:16.376 --> 31:20.297
..but I suspected it was some kind of
intuitive countermeasure...

31:20.380 --> 31:23.300
..to keep the water
from flowing through the gate.

31:23.383 --> 31:28.013
It's possible. My research indicates
that the gate actually has the ability...

31:28.138 --> 31:32.518
..to use density, molecular structure and
the force exerted on the event horizon...

31:32.601 --> 31:35.604
..to determine if something's
trying to pass through.

31:35.729 --> 31:39.233
I know. That's where I got the idea.

31:41.151 --> 31:44.238
(creaking)

31:56.375 --> 31:58.418
Maybourne?

32:02.214 --> 32:05.801
His heart is beating, albeit slowly.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.430
He is getting warmer, O'Neill.

32:11.974 --> 32:14.017
Maybourne!

32:18.647 --> 32:20.691
You hear me?

32:43.130 --> 32:45.174
(whirring)

32:51.847 --> 32:54.683
We're not goin' anywhere, are we?

32:55.893 --> 32:57.936
(whirring stops)

33:01.148 --> 33:02.774
What are you doing?

33:02.900 --> 33:06.153
Pushing the engines harder
will only burn them out again.

33:06.278 --> 33:08.739
Next time I may not be able to fix them.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.949
And if we stay here, we'll run out of air.

33:11.033 --> 33:13.744
If the pressure keeps
increasing at this rate,...

33:13.827 --> 33:17.498
..the sub will implode
long before we run out of air.

33:17.623 --> 33:19.750
Or that.

33:21.293 --> 33:24.213
I figure we have maybe an hour.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.089
I agree.

33:26.173 --> 33:30.719
The front bubble will be most susceptible.
It will be the first to go.

33:31.595 --> 33:36.934
Could we stop agreeing on how we're
gonna die and do something about it?

33:40.604 --> 33:42.648
(creaking)

33:50.155 --> 33:52.366
All right. That's far enough.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.455
Maybourne.

33:59.706 --> 34:02.251
Maybourne, stop!

34:02.334 --> 34:05.003
Move again and I'll shoot!

34:15.931 --> 34:18.308
(Maybourne retches)

34:24.857 --> 34:26.233
Damn!

34:28.985 --> 34:31.280
Jack...

34:31.362 --> 34:33.239
- The freezer.
- What?

34:33.574 --> 34:35.784
Move if you wanna live.

34:35.909 --> 34:39.746
Shoot me if you want to.
We're dead if we don't move now.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.877
Teal'c!

34:50.966 --> 34:53.927
- What are you doing?
- It's too late for him! Jack!

34:54.011 --> 34:57.848
You open that door and we're both dead,
I swear! You can't help him!

34:57.931 --> 35:00.684
Get the hell outta my way.

35:08.275 --> 35:10.736
What the hell's goin' on here?

35:15.324 --> 35:19.620
- (Daniel) You said we're being held here.
- Like something is squeezing the sub.

35:19.745 --> 35:22.206
There's only water out there.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.210
What if it's not water?

35:28.337 --> 35:31.507
Exactly what tests did you run
on the sample you brought back?

35:31.632 --> 35:35.302
As I said, we had begun
preliminary analysis.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.347
It was being kept in a sealed container.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.974
It hadn't even been opened yet
when I went away.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.227
How did you know
it was giving off energy?

35:43.352 --> 35:49.274
The container maintained a temperature
several degrees above room temperature.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.693
You never performed
a chemical analysis?

35:51.777 --> 35:54.863
I insisted the proper controls be set up.

35:55.823 --> 35:58.534
They were supposed to wait
until I got back.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.745
But they didn't.

36:01.870 --> 36:04.498
Colonel Sokalov
was under a lot of pressure...

36:04.581 --> 36:08.085
..to prove that the money being spent
was going to be worth it.

36:08.210 --> 36:11.880
So we don't know
that's actually water out there.

36:12.005 --> 36:14.633
(creaking)

36:18.053 --> 36:20.097
It's alive.

36:24.101 --> 36:25.644
What?

36:25.727 --> 36:27.437
The water.

36:28.021 --> 36:32.067
When they exposed it to the air
and started chemical analysis,...

36:32.150 --> 36:34.194
..it turned into vapour.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.196
You were there?

36:36.280 --> 36:39.449
We inhaled it. It didn't give us a choice.

36:39.575 --> 36:42.911
- Who's "us"?
- Scientists in the lab.

36:42.995 --> 36:46.415
I knew what was going on but l...
I couldn't control myself.

36:46.498 --> 36:49.835
They wanted to go back
through the Stargate.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.423
- Who's "they"?
- Life forms. In the water.

36:54.548 --> 36:59.011
Countless numbers of microscopic
organisms. Intelligent life forms.

37:02.598 --> 37:05.058
Are you tryin' to tell me this water thinks?

37:05.142 --> 37:09.313
We were killing them. They forced us to
try and take 'em back through the gate.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.440
The soldiers tried to stop us.

37:11.565 --> 37:16.778
If an infected man was killed, the fluid
came out of him and more were infected.

37:16.904 --> 37:20.073
An infected soldier got to the DHD
and got the gate open.

37:20.157 --> 37:23.494
Then the base commander
enacted the EM Protocol to stop it.

37:23.577 --> 37:28.540
The infected men started running
through the gate, trying to escape the gas.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.919
Why didn't you?

37:32.002 --> 37:34.296
I was cut off from the gate room.

37:34.838 --> 37:40.052
I think the liquid organisms inside me
knew the only way to keep alive...

37:40.177 --> 37:42.721
..was to escape the gas
and freeze themselves.

37:42.804 --> 37:45.098
They forced me in here.

37:46.225 --> 37:49.645
- You were frozen when we found you.
- They kept me alive.

37:50.270 --> 37:54.399
- How do you know all this?
- I don't know how exactly. I just do.

37:54.483 --> 37:59.446
- They must've communicated it to me.
- This is the stuff that's in Teal'c now?

38:00.989 --> 38:03.617
How do we get it out?

38:03.826 --> 38:08.288
- Come on, Maybourne! It came outta you!
- They needed to go back.

38:08.372 --> 38:13.335
You wouldn't let me go. I guess
they thought Teal'c could get 'em home.

38:27.808 --> 38:30.519
- What if it's a life form?
- That is pure assumption.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.397
It would certainly explain everything.

38:33.480 --> 38:37.776
After collecting the sample, you felt
resistance trying to go through the gate.

38:37.860 --> 38:41.363
It was the life form
trying to prevent you from leaving.

38:41.488 --> 38:44.992
And now it's perceiving us
as some kind of threat.

38:47.661 --> 38:50.122
(creaking)

38:59.965 --> 39:01.550
Teal'c!

39:01.842 --> 39:03.385
Teal'c!

39:06.138 --> 39:08.182
Fight it. Fight it!

39:12.436 --> 39:14.062
Argh!

39:25.532 --> 39:28.702
- It's all we've got.
- The pressure alone...

39:28.785 --> 39:30.412
(creaking)

39:47.221 --> 39:49.264
(chevrons locking)

40:00.484 --> 40:02.528
Daniel?

40:11.495 --> 40:14.039
What are you doing? What's he doing?

40:14.164 --> 40:18.460
- (Carter) Daniel.
- I think it just wants to understand.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.462
What?

40:21.630 --> 40:23.674
Us.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.473
(chevrons locking)

40:47.030 --> 40:49.074
(Stargate gurgles)

40:55.664 --> 40:57.708
(Teal'c groans)

41:27.070 --> 41:29.114
Teal'c?

41:30.866 --> 41:35.245
They had no wish to kill me, O'Neill.
They only want to travel home.

41:35.329 --> 41:37.039
That's good.

41:37.164 --> 41:39.208
You all right?

41:40.834 --> 41:42.878
I will be.

41:44.796 --> 41:46.673
OK, I think we should duck.

42:05.192 --> 42:07.736
Ah. That had to hurt.

42:16.870 --> 42:20.624
Didn't you guys
leave here in a submarine?

42:26.338 --> 42:27.714
We, uh...

42:27.798 --> 42:31.051
Last thing I remember,
we were being pulled into the...

42:33.846 --> 42:36.390
Not really sure what happened, sir.
