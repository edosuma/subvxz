Whack one up there, Steves.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.560
Yeah, that lamppost there,
Steves. Quick time, quick time.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.800
Right, go!

00:27.000 --> 00:31.120
Fuck it! Fuck it, that'll do.
That'll do, Steves. That'll do!

00:45.480 --> 00:48.200
You lot have gotta
hold it down, yeah?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.760
I cannot get caught
on this moped, right?

00:50.800 --> 00:55.680
Since my driving ban,
Roche gets bare weird about it.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.600
Oh, fuck! What's he doing up?

00:58.640 --> 01:02.360
He tells his mum everything.
There's no man code.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.760
Do you know what I mean? Shh!
There should be a man code.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.400
If I want to watch pornos,
let me, don't tell your mum.

01:09.440 --> 01:13.800
If I want to drive the moped,
let me, don't tell your mum.
Them ones.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.000
Little snake!

01:21.240 --> 01:24.720
Here you are, Craig,
made you your breakfast.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.760
-Cheers.
-A man of hidden
talents, ain't he?

01:27.800 --> 01:32.000
I'm not hiding anything,
so just making sure that...

01:32.040 --> 01:34.640
big man gets
a decent breakfast, like.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.600
What time did you get in
last night? I heard you
creeping about like a pervert.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.240
-About two.
-More like four.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.280
Yeah, maybe it was four,
actually. Thank you, Craig.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.640
<i>[director] So are you trying to
work out</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:49.160
<i>a man code with Craig?</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:52.120
Yeah, but it's a bit weird, cos
it's not like a mate man code.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.560
So I'm just trying,
trying to pally it up,

01:55.600 --> 01:59.440
until we're proper connected.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.920
And then I'll bring the code in.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.120
Be good, Craig.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.200
Catch you later.

02:09.759 --> 02:13.520
[drum and bass plays]

02:19.200 --> 02:21.880
-[Grindah] Weapon X?
-Here.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.880
-Fantasy?
-Here.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.400
-Beats?
-Here.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.160
Decoy?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.800
Decoy?

02:31.840 --> 02:34.240
-I drove you here.
-Yeah, but just say "here" then.

02:34.280 --> 02:38.120
Don't...try and overrule
everything constantly.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.720
Right, so, obviously,
today's a very special day.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.960
-Yeah.
-It is the day of the
live caller competition.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
So I've got everyone here
today, basically,

02:50.040 --> 02:55.120
to come up with the question
that one of our number one fans
will be able to answer.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.400
Someone who's worthy of it.
Not just trying to get
a bit of free perfume.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.440
-Yeah, exactly.
-So everyone needs to think.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.720
Yeah? Let's think of a question.
Steven?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.280
You all right?

03:08.320 --> 03:10.120
Fucking hell,
this is bare people.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.920
Yeah, Kurupt FM is
so popular, like.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.640
If you go anywhere in this area,
a few places play it.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.440
There's a café down there
that sometimes, when I pop in,
are playing Kurupt,

03:20.480 --> 03:24.760
and I think, he's just
out there and everyone's
listening to his voice.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.920
So, yeah, it's very, very big
in the Brentford area.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.040
We should probably base it
around someone on the station.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.840
Maybe one of the main ones
or something like that.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.440
Who's one of the main ones?
Just trying to think...

03:38.480 --> 03:40.320
-Probably you.
-Uh?

03:40.360 --> 03:42.880
Probably me? Yeah, yeah.
That could work.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.440
If we did a thing, "How do
crop circles get formed?"

03:45.480 --> 03:47.760
-No, just... Come on.
-That is interesting.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.600
-Cos I don't even know.
-I don't even know.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.720
Yeah, we've always done
competitions, really.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.920
It's part of the whole
sort of pirate radio culture.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.520
-It's a standard thing.
-It's, like, our way of...

04:01.560 --> 04:05.040
giving back something to
the fans, you know what I mean?

04:05.080 --> 04:09.360
This time we've got a special
surprise in store for 'em.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.680
We normally give 'em, like,
a £5 phone credit and that.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.320
But this time, they're
getting designer perfume.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.519
Well, that's what
they think, anyway.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.880
-Are they not getting perfume?
-They are, but...

04:22.920 --> 04:25.760
Got an extra little twist
this time.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.080
-Yeah, me and Grindah
are going to surprise them.
-Don't say it when I...

04:29.120 --> 04:32.920
Cos there's a video on YouTube
where they've crossed,

04:32.960 --> 04:36.400
what's-it-called, Roswell,
where the thing landed,
crashed down,

04:36.440 --> 04:39.240
and they had a dead one.
They did an autopsy on it.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.000
Can we just focus now, yeah?

04:42.040 --> 04:44.160
Focus on the question.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.840
What about, what was
Grindah's old MC name?

04:46.880 --> 04:49.040
That's... I dunno, could that...

04:49.080 --> 04:52.120
-Do you think anyone
would know that?
-Of course they'd know it!

04:52.160 --> 04:55.400
Everyone knows who I am.
If anything it's too easy, mate.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.800
-I could think of a harder one.
-Don't! Just...shh!

04:57.840 --> 05:00.360
Stop getting in his head.
You're making it all about you,

05:00.400 --> 05:04.320
when it's actually about giving
something back to one of
the fans, all right?

05:09.440 --> 05:11.360
Here we go.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.080
This is the prize that
I've kindly donated.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.920
It is, uh, Sean Paul Gaultier.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.960
World exclusive.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.720
Only available from Chabuddy's
Worldwide Internet Cabin Café.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.120
They started to go a bit
stagnant, so I thought
I might as well shift them...

05:27.960 --> 05:30.640
Ho-ho-ho! Here we go.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.400
What every man needs,
a bloody good woman.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.400
Aldona!

05:36.440 --> 05:39.320
I missed you!

05:39.360 --> 05:41.720
-[he laughs]
-Move!

05:41.760 --> 05:45.320
She, uh...
Big day today for Aldona.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.520
Her brother's coming over
from Poland and she's just
doing a bit of cleaning.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.800
She doesn't clean
like this for me.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.120
Oh, I forgive you.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.680
Very good, very good.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.960
[director] What's it like
on competition days?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.080
It's tiring and you've got to
put in a lot of energy,

06:10.120 --> 06:12.200
and also you're blazing
all day, so...

06:12.240 --> 06:14.800
-Kevin.
-I don't want to
get that headache.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.080
-Uh?
-I could've sworn that moped was
facing the other way yesterday.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.760
Yeah? Really?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.640
No one has been using it,
have they?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.160
-No.
-Sure?

06:26.200 --> 06:30.880
Oh, yeah. Uh...
Cos I must've moved it.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.640
Cos the sunlight
was hitting one side,

06:33.680 --> 06:38.920
so the colour was fading, so I
turned it round, so it's even.
I forgot about that.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.120
You remember our little deal
though? Do you want to tell
these lot about it?

06:43.160 --> 06:47.600
Yeah. Man's on a driving ban
right now, so I can't really
drive the moped, like.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.760
-And?
-And we've got a deal where
I can't drive the moped.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.440
-And?
-And if I do drive the 'ped,

06:55.480 --> 06:59.160
then I've got to pick up all the
hard tissues under Craig's bed.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.200
I don't even want to think
about how many there must
be under that bed right now.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.480
Probably like papier-mâché.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.720
Sorry, mate.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.360
-What?
-Nothing, mate.
You just eat your ham.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.520
-All right.
-Take it up with you.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.520
Get your strength up, love.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.120
[director] Do you enjoy
spending time with the family?

07:24.160 --> 07:28.960
Yeah, I really... At first,
I liked just coming
to see Roche.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.480
Just checking her every now and
then, do you know what I mean?

07:31.520 --> 07:33.800
No strings attached, simple.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.920
But then I met the little man
and it all changed.
I felt passion.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.000
And, uh, do you, uh,
do like older women?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.600
-Who me?
-Yeah.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.600
[sighs] I get whatever I can,
to be honest with ya,

07:48.640 --> 07:50.960
and it just so happened
that Roche liked man.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.520
-So I just went through on it.
-What?

07:54.560 --> 07:56.840
<i>Next train to arrive
on platform one...</i>

07:56.880 --> 08:00.960
It should be coming now.
Are you excited?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.720
Is that him? No, that's
some black woman. It's not him.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.160
-Derek!
-That's him.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.720
Oh! That's nice.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.400
They're really affectionate,
that's the thing.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.320
How you doing? You all right?

08:21.280 --> 08:24.520
-You came on train, yeah?
-Train, yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.520
All right, jump in the Merc.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.600
[drum and bass plays]

08:36.919 --> 08:39.679
[they rap]

08:43.039 --> 08:45.840
Right about now, we're
running a competition, yeah?

08:45.880 --> 08:48.360
Right, callers, come through.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.800
So the question is,
what is my old MC name?

08:51.840 --> 08:55.600
So that is, what is
MC Grindah's old MC name?

08:55.640 --> 09:00.840
-Phone number to get
you through will be...
-077009001 108.9!

09:00.880 --> 09:06.160
So to get your hands on
some exclusive perfume,
you know what to do.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.520
-Call us.
-Don't say it.
They already know it.

09:09.560 --> 09:15.640
So, next up, we're just going
to run a little message
from one of our sponsors,

09:15.680 --> 09:19.400
letting you know that if you
want to be winning yourself
something tonight,

09:19.440 --> 09:22.480
then you'd better
get to know...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.360
<i>[Chadbuds] If you are one
of our lucky competition
winners today,</i>

09:25.400 --> 09:28.960
<i>you can claim your prize,
a limited edition bottle
of Sean Paul Gaultier perfume</i>

09:29.000 --> 09:32.440
<i>from Chabuddy's Worldwide
Internet Cabin Café,
but wait, that's not all!</i>

09:34.720 --> 09:36.920
Did you not hear that?

09:36.960 --> 09:42.000
[laughs] Oh, just me on
bloody radio again, isn't it?

09:42.040 --> 09:45.600
Bit of advice for you,
actually, mate. I know you're
fresh off the boat and that.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.040
Ladies love
a disco jockey, mate.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.640
-DJ?
-Yeah, DJ.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.520
No, I like man in kitchen.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.320
-I like when I hear you cook.
-Yeah?

09:56.360 --> 09:59.120
Okay. Think I know
what you want.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.720
Aldona, I'm chopping stuff.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.720
-You like that, yeah?
-Mm, nice!

10:11.760 --> 10:15.120
Did you hear that? I'm chopping.
I was chopping stuff just then.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.360
-Yes.
-You heard it.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.760
-It's very sexy.
-Yeah?

10:19.800 --> 10:22.320
-You chop more.
-More?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.560
Eh, greedy!

10:24.600 --> 10:27.160
[Aldona giggles]

10:27.200 --> 10:30.760
[they speak Polish]

10:30.800 --> 10:33.920
I'm marinating.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.360
You can't hear it,
but I'm marinating.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.360
They're his moped keys. Craig!

10:54.400 --> 10:57.600
Have you seen Kevin
on his moped?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.760
-Yeah. Why?
-When?

10:59.800 --> 11:03.840
-Last night.
-Right then.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.720
What use is he to us in prison?

11:06.760 --> 11:11.640
What use is he to us?
That's more the question.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.920
[drum and bass plays]

11:13.960 --> 11:18.480
-DJ Beats, my selecta,
on points.
-Don't know, don't know.

11:18.520 --> 11:22.600
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're
listening, this is one of the
famous Kurupt FM giveaways.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.240
-Make sure you dial the number.
-Exactly. Do not miss out.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.520
-It's a competition, yeah.
-Exactly.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.760
And the question is...

11:30.800 --> 11:33.400
What is my old MC name?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.200
[mobile rings]

11:36.240 --> 11:39.040
Oh, shh! Everyone quiet.
Be quiet.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.800
Caller, you're live. What's your
name and where do you come from?

11:44.840 --> 11:47.560
<i>-Oh, yeah. Ben from Isleworth.</i>
-Hold tight, Ben!

11:47.600 --> 11:50.480
Big up to Isleworth.
Man dem, I see's ya!

11:50.520 --> 11:52.680
<i>-What's the question?</i>
-What? Are you...?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.480
What is my MC name?

11:55.520 --> 11:58.560
<i>-Which one are you, bro?</i>
-Oh, for f...! Cut him off.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.360
That was pointless, weren't it?

12:02.400 --> 12:06.080
-Big up all
the pointless ringers!
-Let me alliterate, yeah.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.400
If you call up, make sure
you've got the right answer.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.560
-Caller, you're blocked.
-Yeah, you're blocked, mate.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.040
No shout-outs, no reloads!

12:15.080 --> 12:17.880
<i>You made your bed,
now sit in it, you loser.</i>

12:17.920 --> 12:22.040
We always have a VIP party when
there's something special
going on the radio.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.960
Having mocktails,
ain't we, Ange? Okay?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.520
I tried to put, like,
a bit of salt round the edge,

12:28.560 --> 12:32.200
so it'd be like a proper
cocktail, but it all fell in.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.960
Here's to a big night, eh? Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.080
Down it in one.
No, you don't have to.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.680
-Ugh!
-A bit more sugar?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.240
Yeah, all right.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.600
[they speak Polish]

13:06.000 --> 13:08.600
Oh, this is so much fun, guys.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.280
Uh, what shall we do tonight?
I tell you what...

13:12.320 --> 13:17.640
I'll get the CDs out,
have a little disco party,
DJ party. What d'you reckon?

13:19.600 --> 13:22.320
He's bang on it.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.080
-Baby...
-Yes, sweetie.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.480
Get me more beer.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.360
Okay, okay. We can do that.
Drinking games.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.720
I like that. Go hard or
go home back to bloody Poland.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.560
-Okay, you go now?
-Now? Okay, I'll do
whatever you tell me to.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.400
-You know I like
to be bossed around.
-Okay, go now or I hit you.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.920
Okay, okay. I like that.
Drink me mean, keep me keen.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.880
Keep me erect, more like.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.440
It's all right.
He doesn't understand.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.960
Me and Aldona like to
role play, you know.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.760
She'll call me, like,
these funny racist names,

13:58.800 --> 14:01.200
like "you dirty
curry-eating bastard"

14:01.240 --> 14:04.560
and "get back into the lorry
that you climbed out of".

14:04.600 --> 14:07.440
I bloody love it, to be fair.

14:07.480 --> 14:12.320
She'll say things like
that my penis is like a really
red colour and that it's tiny.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.840
[laughs] Sexy, you know.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.560
Maybe we should
change the question.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.680
No, you don't change the
question until someone
gets it right.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.280
Then there's no point in
changing it, anyway, so, no.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.960
Actually, just one last...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.520
Can I use your phone?

14:31.560 --> 14:35.160
Let me give it a bell,
see if it works.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.680
It might be the signal because
of the cameras and that.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.560
-[mobile bleeps]
-Hello.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.640
Oh, for f... No.
Pointless then, innit?

14:46.680 --> 14:49.000
Whatever, leave it.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.960
[loud dance music plays]

15:02.320 --> 15:03.960
Aldona.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.520
Sweetie face.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.960
Sugar tits.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.320
[Aldona giggles]

15:23.920 --> 15:26.080
It's all steamed up.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.480
They must have found
my Wii dance mat.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.600
Got plenty of Polish beers.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.560
It's absolutely pointless.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.520
[mobile rings]

15:55.280 --> 15:58.840
Hello and welcome to
the Kurupt FM hotline.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.440
-What's your name and that?
<i>-It's Joe from Brentford.</i>

16:02.480 --> 16:06.840
Yes, Joseph. Um...
What's the answer?

16:06.880 --> 16:11.120
<i>Um, did he used
to be called MC Sniper?</i>

16:11.160 --> 16:14.200
[cheering]

16:14.240 --> 16:17.600
-Solid sound! Ay-ay-ay!
-Solid sound!

16:17.640 --> 16:21.200
Oh, mate! They're going
absolutely wild.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.320
-Inside!
-It's like a rampage.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.920
-Inside's going mental!
-It's like a rampage
at carnival!

16:25.960 --> 16:28.960
-How you feeling, Joe, mate?
<i>-Good, yeah. Cheers, guys.</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:31.280
Sounds over the moon,
don't he?

16:31.320 --> 16:34.280
<i>Can I get the perfume posted,
cos I'm working?</i>

16:34.320 --> 16:38.120
Sorry, mate. You can't get
it posted. You have to go
down Chabuddy's internet caff.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.240
We'll give you the address.
You're gonna have
such a great time.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.360
<i>All right, no worries.
Cheers, guys.</i>

16:43.400 --> 16:45.640
Any final words, mate?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.840
-Oh, he's been cut off.
-He's probably overexcited.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.960
Probably smiling too much,
the cheek pressed the button.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.240
[radio] <i> Big up, Joe!</i>

16:54.280 --> 16:59.560
That was so nerve-racking, like.
Such an amazing day
for Joe, though.

16:59.600 --> 17:04.920
Little lightweight. She can't
party like her mum can.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.119
-Shall we get a couple
of beers in?
-Yeah, let's get the beers in.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.960
Up with you, mate.
You boys up for a few beers?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.200
Let's go, mate. Come on.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.160
-Oh, mate! Jesus! That is...
-And we're gonna surprise him.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.359
Boys, I've been sick, mate.
I've been sick bruv.

17:19.400 --> 17:23.160
We'll get him to clean up
himself in the morning.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.920
-Oh, that's a fucking success.
-That is a fucking
success, mate!

17:25.960 --> 17:28.160
"Grindah".

17:28.200 --> 17:30.240
Graffiti.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.000
I might even do a little...

17:33.040 --> 17:35.440
headphone sign there as well.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.080
It looks like a penis, mate.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.320
We turned it into a "K",
so...Kurupt, Kurupt.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.120
-It's like our logo.
-Kuruption.

17:51.080 --> 17:55.040
I'll probably just wait in
the Merc. It's warmer in here.

17:59.960 --> 18:04.080
They're obviously having some
kind of dance-off tournament
or something, you know.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.000
Lucky I'm not involved.
I'd probably win every round.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.040
Probably, probably call it
a night, yeah, lads. Yeah?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.600
-Quite a lot this time, yeah?
-Yeah.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.160
You know how I like it,
don't you? Loads.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.840
I don't have it all sticking
up and that. I'm not in
a boy band.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.520
Make sure your head's straight.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.240
-Make sure it's all forward...
-Yeah, I know how to do it.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.320
I invented this one for you.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.320
One of the things I like
most about the job, actually,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.960
is the public appearances,
innit?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.960
Yeah. It must be, like,
so exciting, meeting your
real-life heroes in real life.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.280
It's there.
In our industry, yeah,

19:03.320 --> 19:06.240
we have to give back to the
fans, do you know what I mean?

19:06.280 --> 19:09.160
It's, like, one
little moment in my life,

19:09.200 --> 19:13.160
will change a fan's life
forever, probably, so...

19:13.200 --> 19:17.360
No, I don't really get jealous,
cos I understand what it takes
to be in this sort of industry.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.600
Like, I read a lot
of celeb magazines.

19:19.640 --> 19:24.320
I'm gonna have to
get used to, like, girls
chasing after Grindah.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.280
But you just have that
trust between you.

19:27.320 --> 19:30.120
And, anyway, if anything was
going on I'd know about it,

19:30.160 --> 19:32.560
cos I look through
his emails and texts.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.120
That's perfect, that is.
Looks good, don't it?

19:35.160 --> 19:37.200
-It looks really nice.
-What hat shall I wear with it?

19:37.240 --> 19:41.400
-You don't need a hat, like.
-I'm an MC. I need a hat, okay?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.800
-Right.
-Get me a hat.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.560
There you go.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.080
-Spot on.
-Yeah.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.520
Now get the jeans.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.680
Quite nervous, actually.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.680
About to meet a fan, so, uh...
Never done that before.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.440
-You going out?
-Real exciting.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.040
-Uh?
-Where you going?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.360
-Just got this radio thing.
-All right.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.800
I was wondering, what's better
out of <i> Nuts</i> and <i> Zoo</i> magazine?

20:31.320 --> 20:34.360
<i>Nuts.</i> More posters. Why?

20:34.400 --> 20:38.120
I was thinking I'd get Craig
a bit of afternoon reading.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.640
Are they my moped keys, yeah?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.920
Yeah, they are.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.640
Look, Roche, I'm really sorry,
but I had to ride it
the other night.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.360
-It didn't mean anything though.
-Well, it does mean something.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.160
It means you've broken the deal.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.600
-[director] Is Roche the boss?
-Nah, not of me.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.320
I'm my own boss.
I control my own chakra.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.800
Look like you've been in a bit
of trouble recently though.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.600
Yeah, I've been in a bit
of trouble recently,

21:05.640 --> 21:09.440
but still doesn't make me
not the boss of my life.

21:09.480 --> 21:14.200
Nah, she's in charge though,
to be fair. Realistically,
yeah, she's in charge.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.040
-Cos you know she'll
be seeing this?
-Exactly, that's why I said it.

21:17.080 --> 21:21.560
Well, I'm really sorry. I'll
do it when I get back, yeah?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.840
All right, sweet.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.560
You might want to pick up
some gloves on your way back,

21:26.600 --> 21:30.240
stop the fresh ones from
sticking to your hands.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.760
-Disappointed in you, son.
-Why?

21:44.440 --> 21:46.320
-Safe, brother!
-Nice one!

21:46.360 --> 21:47.840
Easy, boys!

21:47.880 --> 21:51.200
You ready at the fan
signing, yeah?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.600
Good, boys! He loves it.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.880
So this is our, um,
our little fan day.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.280
-Think they're gonna love it.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.240
-Chabsie!
-Chabsie!

22:02.280 --> 22:04.840
Let me do it first.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.000
I think he's in the van.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.440
-Is that him?
-Oh, he's asleep. Shh!

22:09.480 --> 22:11.160
[laughter]

22:11.200 --> 22:14.640
-Pranked him!
-Classic prank.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.600
[whispers]
One, two...

22:17.640 --> 22:20.680
-Chabsie!
-[laughter]

22:20.720 --> 22:23.080
Where the fuck have you been?
You look fucked, mate.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.640
I had a bit of a mental one
last night in the Portacabin.

22:28.680 --> 22:33.680
I must have drank about
eight or nine beers.
I fell asleep in the van.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.880
Is that Aldona's brother, yeah?
They're a bit close, ain't they?

22:36.920 --> 22:40.760
Don't judge, mate, all right?
If you've ever been to Poland...
Then you don't understand it.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.080
I might just go and help
him pack, actually.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.160
-He's got to catch a train.
-All right there, mate.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.360
Is it all right
to use your van?

22:49.400 --> 22:52.160
-The van? Oh, for work? Yeah.
-Nice one.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.160
Now we can burst out like
a music video. Like,
get out the way!

22:56.200 --> 22:58.960
♪ Get out the way
Someone's getting shot... ♪

22:59.000 --> 23:02.960
[director] So if you hadn't
been in music, where
would you be now?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.800
Probably in the slammer, like,
with the street-life technology.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.760
When you're in that
life-street mentality, yeah,

23:10.800 --> 23:13.800
when you're raised in this,
yeah, you've got either music

23:13.840 --> 23:16.920
or jail, like, do you
know what I mean?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.440
I'd probably work
in Megabowl, Feltham,

23:19.480 --> 23:22.680
cos my cousin's got a job there,
so he'd probably hook
me up with that.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.240
Right, so basically, yeah,
you're gonna be standing there.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.480
And then all you do is simple.
You just say, "I ain't got
the perfume,

23:30.520 --> 23:33.680
but maybe Grindah could help
you out with that." Yeah?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.760
And I'm just like, bang!
Boot the door open, like.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.360
You know what I mean? Yeah?
It's gonna be mental.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.120
I'm gonna love this.
And they will as well.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.600
You lot filmed
fan stuff before?

23:48.640 --> 23:53.160
It's pretty...
It can get a bit...on top.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.320
It's started raining
out here now.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.120
-Are you talking to me?
-Yeah.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.840
Well, I'm in the van.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.560
Obviously, it ain't always
about the glamorous lifestyle,

24:06.600 --> 24:10.720
but we'll probably eventually
have our own merchandise, raves,

24:10.760 --> 24:12.920
aftershave line.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.840
-I am Kurupt.
-That's the name of it.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.320
We actually spoke to someone
at Debenham's about it
and they seemed...

24:19.360 --> 24:21.600
They said they was gonna
get in contact, so...

24:21.640 --> 24:24.280
She wasn't really sure,
the girl on the perfume bit.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.400
We need to speak
to people higher up.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.720
I should have just gone
round the back of the van.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.640
Just walked out. This is
a bit of a piss-take now.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.120
-Any sign of him or what?
-Nothing yet, mate.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.040
Dead out.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.320
Hold on!

24:43.360 --> 24:46.240
-I can see him now.
-Don't forget the signal.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.560
No, I won't.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.840
-You all right, mate.
-Hello.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.440
You all right? Uh, we were
gonna give you perfume,

24:55.480 --> 24:57.560
but we ran out.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.160
-What?
-Yeah, we ran out.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.480
But maybe...

25:05.520 --> 25:08.040
just maybe...

25:08.080 --> 25:10.800
-Uh?
-You've locked the door!

25:10.840 --> 25:13.040
Beats!
It's a fucking joke!

25:13.080 --> 25:16.440
That's not it, for fuck's
sake! You've ruined it.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.680
You've fucked up the whole
thing. That's not how
it's meant to go.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.000
-You've completely ruined it.
-Shall we go again?

25:23.040 --> 25:26.200
We can't go again.
He's seen me now. Look at him.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.160
He won't be surprised.
It's a waste of time.
The whole vibe's been ruined.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.480
Let's do a photo,
let's do a picture.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.400
-Steves.
-I got a camera.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.320
I've got to shoot off in a
second. I'm on my lunch break.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.560
Yeah, I'm in a rush as well.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.600
That's it.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.440
Actually, have you got one
without all the writing on it?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.680
That's signed by us.
That's the whole point.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.920
Well, it's actually a present.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.280
Go in there afterwards.
He'll sort you out one.

25:53.320 --> 25:57.840
This is a joke, right?
What's the point without
us signing anything, like?

25:57.880 --> 26:00.960
What about the shirt,
like a footballer?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.160
Fuck it, yeah.
Let's just use my shirt.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.320
Yeah, sign the shirt, yeah?
He said we can sign his shirt.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.480
Just an average fan signing.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.840
It's what happens. Part and
parcel of the business, really.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.120
-Yeah, pass and parcel.
-Come on, let's go, let's go.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.120
-Aah!
-Uh!

26:20.160 --> 26:23.480
-Smiling, yeah?
-Yeah!

26:23.520 --> 26:27.200
Nice one, mate. See you later.
Pop yourself off, yeah?

26:27.240 --> 26:30.000
He loved it.
Did you not get that, yeah?

26:30.040 --> 26:33.400
Signed the shirt and everything.
It does happen quite a lot.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.240
-See you later, mate!
-I got one, so...

26:36.280 --> 26:38.960
-Cheers. See you.
-See later, mate.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.720
-That was really draining.
-No, it is, it is.
You have to get used to it.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.640
<i>I just love the way that she,
kind of, treats me like shit.</i>

26:57.680 --> 27:00.880
That's real, you know.
I'd rather be with
someone like that,

27:00.920 --> 27:03.520
than be with some bloody
bimbo bitch.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.040
Cos most of the girls
are like that with me.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.400
They see the money,
they see the moustache,

27:08.440 --> 27:11.320
they see the Gucci, the Prada,
Versace and that, yeah.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.960
"He's obviously got money,"
isn't it, yeah?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.640
But I don't want that. I don't
get that. I want a real bitch.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.680
A real thug who's a real bitch.
And she's a real bitch.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.040
She's my bitch.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.080
Uuh!

27:32.120 --> 27:34.320
Absolutely bloody mental!

27:34.360 --> 27:36.920
Oh, my God.
How did it go?

27:36.960 --> 27:39.520
Yeah, good, actually.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.360
I ended up signing his shirt.
So just standard for me really.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.520
-What, his actual shirt?
-Yeah. Got you
something as well.

27:45.560 --> 27:50.520
-What did you get me?
-Nothing, just a little...
Sean Paul Gaultier perfume.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.120
What?

27:53.160 --> 27:56.400
For free, as well.
Don't even worry about
giving me any money.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.960
Amazing!
Actual Sean Paul Gaultier?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.040
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you so much.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.760
Cool. Just...

28:03.800 --> 28:04.960
Ah!

28:06.120 --> 28:08.120
It's lovely. Love you.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.640
-That...
-Come on, give me a kiss.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.680
-Love you.
-You too.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.200
And Beats signed it too.
That's nice.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.080
[Beats] It smells like crap!

28:26.880 --> 28:30.160
Allow putting this
on the telly. Stop!
