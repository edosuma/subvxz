<i>Tony Rodrigues takes the lead.</i>

04:44.047 --> 04:45.088
What a damn shame.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.880
With the right bike,

04:49.630 --> 04:50.547
you'd have won.

04:52.505 --> 04:53.630
Mike Paterson.

04:54.963 --> 04:58.755
I'm starting a new stable with Ducati.
We signed Chris Walker.

04:59.547 --> 05:01.255
We need a second rider.

05:01.338 --> 05:04.047
If you're interested, come for the trials.

06:00.088 --> 06:01.713
Sorry, I couldn't get away.

06:01.797 --> 06:03.797
I told you I had an interview.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.838
- Want a lift?
- What do we do with him?

06:07.588 --> 06:08.588
Three on your bike?

06:10.130 --> 06:11.213
We've done it before.

06:11.588 --> 06:12.838
Forget it, I'll manage.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.713
Put this on, honey.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.255
I'll call you tonight.

06:25.547 --> 06:26.505
Up you get.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.422
Your feet.

06:32.547 --> 06:34.255
Are you sulking, too?

06:36.463 --> 06:38.005
Pity, I had a surprise for you.

06:39.172 --> 06:42.588
- What is it?
- I won't tell you now, sulky face.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.213
C'mon, Dad!

08:09.213 --> 08:11.213
Is Mom still with that guy Samir?

08:12.172 --> 08:14.297
He doesn't come over much anymore.

08:14.797 --> 08:16.255
Do you still scowl at him?

08:16.338 --> 08:18.088
- Yeah.
- Show me what you do.

08:19.713 --> 08:20.547
Good.

09:05.338 --> 09:06.838
Great. Thanks, girls.

09:19.130 --> 09:20.297
Hi, honey. You're OK?

09:20.630 --> 09:21.463
Yes.

09:21.922 --> 09:22.922
- Hey.
- You're OK?

09:26.338 --> 09:27.838
How was your interview?

09:28.422 --> 09:29.755
I don't know. We'll see.

09:30.255 --> 09:32.838
- I'll just take a shower.
- OK.

09:33.213 --> 09:35.547
- Pick him up on Friday at 6?
- Yeah.

09:35.630 --> 09:36.463
Okay.

09:39.463 --> 09:41.130
Gentlemen, welcome.

09:41.505 --> 09:42.380
Our goal

09:42.922 --> 09:46.547
is to win the Superbike Championship,
then the GP.

09:47.047 --> 09:50.380
So, we need the best of you 4.
We'll work you hard.

09:51.338 --> 09:53.672
Caroline will do the paperwork,

09:53.755 --> 09:56.505
then you can warm up on the track.

11:33.838 --> 11:35.172
Hey, you can't park there.

11:38.713 --> 11:40.672
- How's it going?
- Good, and you?

11:41.547 --> 11:42.922
So, you're turning pro?

11:43.422 --> 11:44.297
Who told you?

11:44.380 --> 11:45.755
We haven't forgotten you.

11:46.422 --> 11:48.505
The way you used to burn up the tarmac.

11:50.297 --> 11:52.380
- So, are you in?
- Not yet.

11:52.463 --> 11:53.713
They'll keep one of us.

11:53.797 --> 11:54.880
I can deal with 'em.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.130
I'm joking!

12:01.463 --> 12:03.963
- How's your Mom?
- Fine.

12:04.047 --> 12:06.547
- She's happier there.
- Tell me when you go.

12:06.922 --> 12:08.838
- OK.
- Portuguese chicks love me!

12:12.213 --> 12:14.088
- Tell her I said hi.
- Sure.

12:15.255 --> 12:16.088
Bye.

13:29.672 --> 13:30.672
What happened?

13:31.588 --> 13:32.422
Leyla...

13:34.380 --> 13:35.463
- Hey...
- Get off!

13:42.838 --> 13:43.797
Talk to me, dammit!

13:48.755 --> 13:50.463
- What're you doing?
- Calling the cops.

13:50.547 --> 13:51.755
Hang up.

13:52.255 --> 13:55.005
- So, what happened?
- I've been hiding drugs here.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.588
What?

13:59.755 --> 14:00.672
You heard me.

14:02.338 --> 14:03.338
You're shitting me.

14:12.505 --> 14:13.672
It was only temporary.

14:14.130 --> 14:15.172
Just a few months.

14:16.672 --> 14:17.505
Till I got a job.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.588
Why didn't you tell me?

14:21.880 --> 14:22.922
I'd have helped you.

14:23.255 --> 14:24.172
You're broke, Tony.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.630
You spend your money on your bike.

14:27.713 --> 14:30.005
Do you realize what you've done?

14:30.422 --> 14:32.172
Did you consider Sofiane?

14:32.255 --> 14:33.588
Since when have you cared?

14:35.505 --> 14:36.838
You just care about yourself.

14:52.255 --> 14:53.380
Why did they hit you?

14:55.338 --> 14:56.547
The drugs were stolen.

14:58.255 --> 15:00.422
I'm sure it was Samir. Only he knew.

15:01.672 --> 15:02.672
How much was there?

15:05.255 --> 15:06.130
50,000.

15:06.672 --> 15:07.505
Shit.

15:09.422 --> 15:11.380
I have a week to pay or they'll be back.

15:14.838 --> 15:16.005
We'll work it out.

15:20.088 --> 15:21.713
You can stay at my place.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.463
You can't stay here.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.713
Hey.

15:44.963 --> 15:47.588
Here are some towels and pillows.

15:49.880 --> 15:50.797
Thanks.

15:52.213 --> 15:53.630
If you need anything...

15:54.630 --> 15:55.463
OK.

16:16.338 --> 16:17.338
Yo!

16:17.755 --> 16:19.963
- Want weed?
- I wanna see Moussa.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.338
- No Moussa here.
- I know him.

16:22.422 --> 16:24.088
You don't get it. Fuck off.

16:24.172 --> 16:25.755
You fuck off.

16:25.838 --> 16:27.005
Max!

16:27.838 --> 16:28.672
Drop it.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.713
- Looking for your bike?
- Yeah.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.172
It's not safe here.

16:38.755 --> 16:40.713
Max, go get his bike.

16:42.922 --> 16:44.797
- You OK?
- Can we talk?

16:46.588 --> 16:48.297
Guys are squeezing you out.

16:48.380 --> 16:49.547
Yeah. So?

16:50.547 --> 16:51.463
You do nothing?

16:52.713 --> 16:53.922
I can't stop the gypsies.

16:55.213 --> 16:56.338
Leyla's in trouble.

16:58.255 --> 16:59.297
What kind of trouble?

17:01.047 --> 17:02.130
She owes them money.

17:04.838 --> 17:05.838
I wanna meet them.

17:10.380 --> 17:11.338
Moussa, please...

17:12.463 --> 17:14.255
It must be Jordan.

17:14.547 --> 17:15.713
He works for Miguel.

17:17.047 --> 17:19.463
Miguel's a big shot.
Only works with his own.

17:19.922 --> 17:21.088
You can't get near them.

17:21.797 --> 17:24.588
- Jordan got a tattoo on his neck?
- Yeah.

17:25.172 --> 17:26.005
OK.

17:26.422 --> 17:28.130
- I need to talk to him.
- Forget it.

17:29.547 --> 17:30.880
And forget the cops.

17:32.463 --> 17:34.255
I know how it works here.

17:34.338 --> 17:36.047
What are you talking about?

17:37.047 --> 17:39.213
You grew up in a nice house.

17:39.630 --> 17:42.505
- Not in the hood, biker boy.
- I'll handle it.

17:42.588 --> 17:44.380
- Will you?
- Yeah.

17:45.047 --> 17:47.713
- Leyla has to pay them back.
- She can't.

17:49.922 --> 17:52.755
- So, I need to see them.
- Are you deaf?

17:52.838 --> 17:54.047
So, where can I find them?

17:59.172 --> 18:02.463
BAR THE THIRST BETS

18:30.755 --> 18:31.630
Hello.

18:31.713 --> 18:32.880
I'm looking for Jordan.

18:33.463 --> 18:34.630
No Jordan here.

18:39.713 --> 18:41.172
I'll have a coffee.

19:16.672 --> 19:17.588
What d'ya want?

19:18.880 --> 19:20.130
It's about Leyla.

19:20.713 --> 19:21.547
Got my money?

19:22.297 --> 19:23.422
No, that's just it.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.755
It's not her fault.
Her ex stole your gear.

19:27.838 --> 19:29.088
Oh, OK.

19:29.172 --> 19:32.380
I don't give a shit.
She shouldn't let bums fuck her.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.505
She can't pay.

19:34.588 --> 19:36.172
She owes me. Period.

19:37.755 --> 19:38.630
Scram.

19:57.922 --> 19:59.422
That's a fine bike.

20:00.505 --> 20:02.422
- It must go fast.
- Yeah.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.380
Your back tire is bald.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.505
Do you race your friends?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.338
Yeah, sometimes.

20:16.630 --> 20:18.130
So, you wanna help your girl?

20:24.588 --> 20:26.255
She's my son's mom, not my girl.

20:26.797 --> 20:28.630
- She's your son's mom?
- Yeah.

20:31.088 --> 20:32.922
You OK with her stashing gear?

20:35.880 --> 20:38.255
Not a great role model, is she?

20:42.713 --> 20:45.005
Look, I'll soon be a pro racer.

20:46.255 --> 20:47.880
I can pay in instalments.

20:50.755 --> 20:53.005
Over 10 years, every month?

20:54.922 --> 20:56.338
Think I'm a bank?

20:57.838 --> 20:59.922
Give me time to find a solution.

21:00.422 --> 21:02.005
Start by selling your bike.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.505
Your girl could work for us.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.297
Jordan said she's pretty.

21:15.005 --> 21:16.255
Think it over.

21:52.922 --> 21:53.838
Need a hand?

21:53.922 --> 21:55.422
No, it's OK.

22:06.297 --> 22:07.297
Are we in the way?

22:08.422 --> 22:09.255
No.

22:12.338 --> 22:13.547
I'm glad you're here.

22:14.047 --> 22:14.922
Are you sure?

22:15.297 --> 22:16.172
Yeah.

22:17.547 --> 22:18.380
Why?

22:19.422 --> 22:20.380
I don't know.

22:22.505 --> 22:24.255
You usually tire of us fast.

22:25.963 --> 22:26.797
Mom...

22:27.630 --> 22:29.088
Come see what I've done.

22:30.297 --> 22:31.130
OK, honey.

22:44.297 --> 22:46.047
- Hello.
- Still wanna help her?

22:51.297 --> 22:52.255
Yeah.

23:28.338 --> 23:29.380
Sit your ass down.

24:18.797 --> 24:19.630
Come on.

24:22.172 --> 24:23.463
- What?
- I said, come on.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.005
Leave your helmet. Follow me.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.672
Move.

24:41.838 --> 24:42.672
Get in.

24:44.213 --> 24:45.172
I said, get in.

25:48.922 --> 25:49.755
Out.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.797
- Where are we?
- Don't move. Wait here.

27:15.588 --> 27:16.672
You gotta deliver this

27:18.338 --> 27:19.963
to the tattoo parlor. In two hours.

27:22.505 --> 27:25.213
Rotterdam is 10 kms away.
There's the highway.

27:25.297 --> 27:28.088
120 kms away,
don't stop at the toll booth.

27:28.172 --> 27:30.088
Speed through the right lane.

27:31.213 --> 27:33.380
There's a rest area just after it.

27:33.463 --> 27:34.922
Our guys will fill your tank.

27:35.713 --> 27:36.547
Got it?

27:40.588 --> 27:41.672
If you're late,

27:41.755 --> 27:44.088
if the gear gets lost or you get caught,

27:44.797 --> 27:46.588
they'll waste your girlfriend.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.547
Hurry the fuck up!

28:48.463 --> 28:50.505
ROTTERDAM

30:21.880 --> 30:23.547
You're late! What're you playing at?

30:40.338 --> 30:41.172
Thirsty?

30:41.713 --> 30:42.713
Yeah.

30:47.463 --> 30:48.422
OK, OK!

30:48.672 --> 30:50.005
Give me that.

30:52.338 --> 30:54.297
Get the fuck outta here! Fast!

31:21.755 --> 31:23.088
NAMUR 58
CHARLEROI 23

33:23.630 --> 33:24.630
You're late, kid.

33:50.755 --> 33:51.838
It's not all here.

33:53.172 --> 33:54.005
What?

33:57.422 --> 33:59.130
It's all I was given.

34:00.713 --> 34:02.297
- You were given more.
- No.

34:06.547 --> 34:07.755
You did a detour.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.005
No, I came straight here.

34:21.422 --> 34:22.630
Here.

34:23.922 --> 34:25.130
FLOUR

34:26.047 --> 34:27.588
Make your kid some cakes.

34:33.797 --> 34:35.713
Work two months and we're quits.

34:37.713 --> 34:39.338
- Two months?
- Yeah.

34:39.630 --> 34:41.755
One of my drivers is on maternity leave!

34:45.255 --> 34:46.630
Two months and we're good?

34:48.422 --> 34:49.422
I just said so.

34:51.922 --> 34:52.838
OK.

34:54.713 --> 34:55.547
Here.

34:56.797 --> 34:59.047
Keep this with you 24/7, OK?

34:59.713 --> 35:01.422
When we call, you pick up.

35:05.630 --> 35:07.297
Thursday, same time, same place.

36:03.713 --> 36:04.547
Tony!

36:06.463 --> 36:07.338
I know. Sorry.

36:07.713 --> 36:08.588
Yeah, yeah.

36:29.838 --> 36:31.880
UNKNOWN CALLER

36:34.838 --> 36:35.672
Tony.

36:36.838 --> 36:37.838
We're waiting.

36:38.505 --> 36:39.338
Coming.

37:17.505 --> 37:19.130
What were you playing at?

37:19.213 --> 37:22.172
You gotta be more precise on the bends.

37:22.505 --> 37:24.213
OK? See you tomorrow.

37:29.463 --> 37:31.838
I saw how you took the last bend.

37:32.088 --> 37:32.922
Well done.

37:33.713 --> 37:35.630
- Thanks.
- How old are you?

37:35.922 --> 37:36.755
Twenty-six.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.380
You're lucky to be here.

37:39.922 --> 37:40.797
I know.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.463
Gotta make sacrifices to be on the team.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.047
Yeah, I realize that.

37:45.838 --> 37:48.130
- I'm committed.
- Good, because...

37:48.505 --> 37:49.547
you're the oldest.

37:50.713 --> 37:51.963
If I invest in you,

37:52.505 --> 37:53.338
you'll have...

37:54.130 --> 37:56.630
five or six years at the top... at best.

37:58.005 --> 38:00.755
I'm looking for young people
with potential.

38:02.963 --> 38:05.963
I have potential. I'll be the best.

38:08.255 --> 38:09.338
From now on,

38:10.713 --> 38:12.922
you'll beat them by half a second per lap.

38:14.213 --> 38:15.088
Got it?

38:17.797 --> 38:18.630
OK.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.463
By the way,

38:23.380 --> 38:24.963
I was told you have a job.

38:25.547 --> 38:26.630
Yeah, part-time.

38:27.588 --> 38:28.463
Quit it.

38:30.047 --> 38:31.255
You have no time to lose.

38:33.755 --> 38:34.922
A small guy.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.297
He rides bikes here.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.922
Check instead of staring at me, bitch!

38:42.630 --> 38:43.505
What the...

38:43.713 --> 38:45.088
I told you 24/7.

38:46.172 --> 38:48.130
- We need you right now.
- I can't.

38:48.213 --> 38:49.130
- You can't?
- No...

38:49.505 --> 38:50.963
- What...
- I warn you.

38:51.047 --> 38:53.463
- We said Thursday.
- I'll call on your chick.

38:53.547 --> 38:54.380
No.

38:54.713 --> 38:56.047
So, move your ass. Now.

40:09.672 --> 40:11.255
Quick! Cops are after me!

40:11.463 --> 40:12.797
The cops are right behind me!

40:16.130 --> 40:17.380
Come on, come on!

40:26.797 --> 40:29.005
It's too long. Stop it!

41:26.255 --> 41:27.213
He's here now.

41:32.338 --> 41:33.338
Wanna talk to him?

41:34.672 --> 41:35.588
I'll put him on.

41:36.755 --> 41:37.797
It's Miguel.

41:38.422 --> 41:39.380
Gimme the bag.

41:39.713 --> 41:41.422
- The key.
- It's there.

41:43.547 --> 41:45.297
- Hello.
- <i>Was it a close call?</i>

41:46.380 --> 41:48.338
Yeah, very close.

41:48.963 --> 41:50.255
I can't carry on like this.

41:51.297 --> 41:54.880
- <i>Why?</i>
- The bike's speed restricted.

41:54.963 --> 41:57.088
I need full power. 100 HP is no good.

41:58.963 --> 42:00.172
I need a second bike, too.

42:01.922 --> 42:04.297
It's the only way not to get caught.

42:04.797 --> 42:06.797
<i>We'll see. Put Jordan back on.</i>

42:07.380 --> 42:08.213
Here.

42:10.672 --> 42:13.005
What? He doesn't know a thing.

42:13.630 --> 42:16.213
I'll find someone. No need for two bikes.

42:17.422 --> 42:18.838
Why not a bus, too?!

42:22.380 --> 42:23.713
I told you I don't trust him.

42:26.630 --> 42:28.005
OK, I'll do that.

42:31.130 --> 42:31.963
Here.

42:32.380 --> 42:35.505
Miguel doesn't want this here.
See you at the hideout.

43:31.297 --> 43:32.172
Tony?

43:35.255 --> 43:37.422
- I woke you?
- I couldn't sleep.

43:39.880 --> 43:40.797
Where were you?

43:41.588 --> 43:43.255
Standing in for a colleague.

43:47.672 --> 43:49.005
Sorry, I should've told you.

43:53.213 --> 43:54.213
What is it?

44:01.713 --> 44:02.713
I went to see Moussa.

44:04.630 --> 44:05.755
Your problem's settled.

44:08.588 --> 44:10.213
He knows people. We worked it out.

44:10.297 --> 44:11.922
What do you mean, we worked it out?

44:13.338 --> 44:14.630
You don't owe them anything.

44:21.005 --> 44:22.213
Leyla, it's settled.

44:25.213 --> 44:26.213
I'm sorry.

44:29.672 --> 44:30.838
For getting you involved.

44:45.672 --> 44:48.630
- Thank you for your help.
- No problem.

44:50.547 --> 44:53.130
I was sick of you
walking around in your panties.

44:57.505 --> 44:58.505
Are you OK?

44:59.547 --> 45:00.380
Yeah.

45:03.255 --> 45:04.505
- I'll go.
- OK.

45:34.172 --> 45:37.547
THE THIRST

45:39.172 --> 45:42.463
The hairdresser has 1.75 euros.
And the storekeeper?

45:44.672 --> 45:45.505
Hey, champ.

45:46.797 --> 45:47.922
I'll be right with you.

45:51.213 --> 45:52.547
What calculation is that?

45:54.463 --> 45:57.588
- It's a subtraction, isn't it?
- Good.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.588
OK, work it out, son.

46:01.255 --> 46:02.172
I'll be right back.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.588
Want a drink?

46:05.672 --> 46:06.672
No, thanks.

46:08.297 --> 46:09.755
I ordered a new bike.

46:13.297 --> 46:14.422
Aren't you pleased?

46:15.588 --> 46:17.047
- I am.
- You better be.

46:18.547 --> 46:19.380
Listen...

46:21.505 --> 46:23.547
With 2 bikes, you can carry more.

46:24.213 --> 46:26.672
- I'll have to see.
- No need.

46:27.088 --> 46:28.963
You can carry more. I'm telling you.

46:32.463 --> 46:33.297
OK.

46:34.255 --> 46:35.088
Good.

47:35.713 --> 47:36.713
Look.

47:37.713 --> 47:39.672
It's been derestricted. Happy now?

47:42.172 --> 47:43.172
- Yeah.
- Here.

47:48.755 --> 47:50.005
Hang on, look at me.

47:51.297 --> 47:52.547
- Look at me.
- What?

47:54.463 --> 47:55.505
You look beat.

47:56.713 --> 47:57.838
- No.
- Wait a minute.

48:00.963 --> 48:01.963
Take this.

48:04.130 --> 48:05.005
What is it?

48:05.213 --> 48:06.338
It'll keep you awake.

48:07.797 --> 48:08.630
I'm OK.

48:08.838 --> 48:11.172
- It'll help.
- No, it's OK.

48:11.255 --> 48:12.547
- Go on.
- No.

48:14.547 --> 48:17.338
I lost one driver. So, don't be a jerk.

48:18.255 --> 48:19.130
Take it.

48:33.755 --> 48:36.047
There. That's good.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.797
He's here. He's leaving.

48:47.838 --> 48:49.297
It'll be fine. Why?

48:50.213 --> 48:51.213
What do you want?

48:52.172 --> 48:54.838
You're pissing me off, Jordan!
Stop all that!

48:55.838 --> 48:59.172
Don't go on about Farid.
I won't work with the Arabs.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.213
What's so hard to understand?

49:02.297 --> 49:03.172
Dammit!

49:04.130 --> 49:05.422
Why are you still here?

49:06.172 --> 49:08.588
Jordan's waiting. You got two hours. Move!

49:11.880 --> 49:14.797
ROTTERDAM

51:58.922 --> 52:02.297
<i>Accelerate hard out of the bends.</i>

52:02.963 --> 52:03.797
OK, guys.

52:05.380 --> 52:06.505
Tomorrow's the big day.

52:07.422 --> 52:09.672
You're all in with a chance,
so take my advice.

52:11.172 --> 52:12.130
Give it your all.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.630
And rest up tonight.

52:15.255 --> 52:16.880
OK, see you tomorrow.

52:22.588 --> 52:23.422
Tony.

52:24.963 --> 52:26.005
Can I have a word?

52:33.088 --> 52:34.047
What's going on?

52:36.088 --> 52:36.922
What?

52:37.797 --> 52:39.130
I thought you were the best.

52:41.505 --> 52:42.713
I don't recognize you.

52:50.838 --> 52:51.713
Wake up.

52:53.463 --> 52:54.380
I will.

52:56.505 --> 52:57.838
It's your last chance.

53:07.463 --> 53:09.213
UNKNOWN CALLER

53:37.547 --> 53:40.297
EURO-AREA INFLATION NEGATIVE

53:41.380 --> 53:42.713
Yeah. Through the bridge.

53:43.088 --> 53:44.047
Come in.

53:45.672 --> 53:47.922
We'll do it my way. It's tonight.

53:48.963 --> 53:50.338
Because I said so.

53:52.588 --> 53:54.130
Don't get carried away.

53:54.213 --> 53:56.047
I didn't want to work with you.

53:56.797 --> 53:57.672
Sit.

54:00.630 --> 54:03.047
But the amounts we discussed interest me.

54:03.713 --> 54:05.422
And Jordan is vouching for you.

54:08.088 --> 54:09.797
I don't care what you think, Farid.

54:13.047 --> 54:13.963
I'll call you.

54:23.255 --> 54:24.755
Look at those animals.

54:25.922 --> 54:27.088
They're savages.

54:28.713 --> 54:30.838
My kids won't mingle with scum.

54:33.297 --> 54:34.130
Tell him.

54:34.880 --> 54:38.588
With all those fuckers rioting,
no coke is getting into the hood.

54:39.547 --> 54:41.588
We're gonna pay a guy I know

54:41.838 --> 54:45.088
and they'll raise hell
in one part of the hood.

54:45.713 --> 54:47.422
That'll keep the cops busy.

54:48.130 --> 54:49.380
You're gonna do the drop.

54:53.797 --> 54:54.922
What bike do you need?

54:56.588 --> 54:57.463
A T-Max.

54:57.672 --> 54:59.255
No, a dirt bike.

54:59.338 --> 55:00.880
11 PM tonight at the parlor.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.130
Jordan will pick you up.

55:07.297 --> 55:09.672
NEIGHBORHOOD UNDER SIEGE

55:09.755 --> 55:11.922
FIFTH DAY OF FIGHTING

56:07.797 --> 56:08.672
How's it going?

56:16.463 --> 56:17.755
I don't believe it.

56:20.172 --> 56:21.547
You're Miguel's bitch now?

56:24.172 --> 56:25.297
I know what I'm doing.

56:26.297 --> 56:27.297
Let me handle it.

56:27.630 --> 56:28.547
Move.

56:32.255 --> 56:33.172
Move, Moussa.

56:33.880 --> 56:34.713
Please.

56:42.422 --> 56:44.630
- What's he doing here?
- Nothing.

56:44.713 --> 56:45.713
Son of a bitch!

56:47.547 --> 56:48.588
What's that, negro?

56:49.963 --> 56:50.838
Moussa, please...

56:54.922 --> 56:56.213
Go back to your corner boys.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.713
Hey, Farid.

57:47.463 --> 57:48.380
Yo, man.

57:50.630 --> 57:52.005
- Your delivery boy?
- Yes.

58:05.088 --> 58:07.880
Miguel, it's great to work with you.

58:09.838 --> 58:11.838
Arabs aren't usually your thing.

58:17.713 --> 58:19.505
- Ready?
- Yeah.

58:35.047 --> 58:35.963
It's simple.

58:36.047 --> 58:38.255
Go along here to the bridge,

58:38.672 --> 58:39.588
through the tunnel,

58:39.880 --> 58:40.963
then turn left.

58:41.838 --> 58:45.588
Keep going to a red lamppost.
Dump the bag there.

58:45.880 --> 58:47.838
- By the lamppost?
- Yeah.

58:50.130 --> 58:51.047
Repeat it.

58:54.672 --> 58:58.213
The bridge, the tunnel, turn left,
red lamppost.

58:59.213 --> 59:01.380
There's 50 grand in there, so no fuck-ups.

59:02.088 --> 59:03.547
We won't stay here forever.

59:04.422 --> 59:08.213
If you're not back in ten minutes,
we'll go, you're on your own.

59:25.588 --> 59:26.588
<i>Out of the way!</i>

59:28.630 --> 59:29.630
<i>Out of the way!</i>

59:31.297 --> 59:32.255
<i>Ready to charge!</i>

01:01:10.005 --> 01:01:10.922
Stop!

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.588
- Come back!
- Drop the bag!

01:01:13.797 --> 01:01:15.797
- Drop it!
- Get him!

01:01:19.213 --> 01:01:21.005
- You fucker!
- Come here!

01:01:27.255 --> 01:01:28.505
Stop!

01:01:35.005 --> 01:01:37.380
He's coming your way!

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.838
He's coming your way!

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.672
Drop your bag!

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:54.630
He's coming your way!

01:02:01.422 --> 01:02:02.713
Catch him!

01:02:07.255 --> 01:02:09.755
Where is the sonovabitch?

01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:12.213
He went that way. Come on!

01:02:21.922 --> 01:02:23.505
We'll get you!

01:02:23.588 --> 01:02:26.963
- You can't hide!
- We'll find you, you bastard!

01:02:27.838 --> 01:02:29.713
We just want your bag.

01:02:32.005 --> 01:02:34.005
You sonovabitch!

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:36.422
If we find you, you're dead!

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:39.088
You're dead, you hear?

01:02:51.672 --> 01:02:54.338
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I got shot at.

01:02:54.422 --> 01:02:55.422
<i>What?</i>

01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:58.255
They shot at me.

01:02:58.338 --> 01:03:00.755
Shit! Do you still have the gear?

01:03:01.672 --> 01:03:03.338
- <i>Hey!</i>
- They're gonna kill me.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.297
Get me out of here.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.297
<i>No, it's in lockdown. We can't get in.</i>

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.630
<i>You're on your own.</i>

01:03:10.838 --> 01:03:11.797
What can I do?

01:03:12.838 --> 01:03:14.422
<i>Tony, are you there?</i>

01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:17.630
<i>Bring me that fuckin' bag.</i>

01:03:19.547 --> 01:03:22.380
- I can't move.
- <i>Get outta there!</i>

01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:25.463
<i>Come back. The red lamppost...</i>

01:03:25.547 --> 01:03:26.630
What?

01:03:28.963 --> 01:03:29.880
Hello?

01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:15.547
He's back there!

01:04:15.755 --> 01:04:17.547
Come back, guys!

01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:20.380
Come back or you're dead!

01:04:22.505 --> 01:04:24.297
You fuckin' bastard!

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.297
Drop the bag!

01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:28.088
There he is!

01:04:32.255 --> 01:04:33.463
Get in!

01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:42.005
Go, go!

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.880
We're safe now.

01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:19.713
I'll kill your fuckin' Farid!

01:05:20.297 --> 01:05:21.963
He set up the deal.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:25.213
Tarek tried to screw us.
We were delivering it to him.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:29.463
He took advantage of all this mess.
Farid is legit.

01:05:29.547 --> 01:05:30.880
And are you legit?

01:05:32.338 --> 01:05:34.630
- What?
- Why defend him? Are you on the take?

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:36.672
What?

01:05:37.297 --> 01:05:38.463
I'm on the take?

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.088
- I'll call him and ask.
- No!

01:05:41.963 --> 01:05:43.005
I don't wanna see him.

01:05:43.547 --> 01:05:45.297
But you find me Tarek.

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:49.255
Tell Farid he owes me for the bike.

01:05:49.338 --> 01:05:51.255
It'll teach him not to treat me like that.

01:10:21.338 --> 01:10:24.255
UNKNOWN CALLER

01:10:24.672 --> 01:10:27.380
He's over-confident.
We'll have trouble with him.

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:31.755
Where to?

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:34.005
Nowhere. Sit down.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.380
What's wrong?

01:10:48.297 --> 01:10:49.838
- Gonna cry?
- Jordan.

01:10:50.255 --> 01:10:51.088
Move.

01:10:51.672 --> 01:10:53.755
- What?
- I need to talk to Tony.

01:10:54.047 --> 01:10:55.547
- Bye.
- What the fuck?

01:11:14.963 --> 01:11:15.797
What's up?

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.005
Nothing. What am I doing here?

01:11:19.297 --> 01:11:20.630
I want us to work together.

01:11:22.297 --> 01:11:24.088
If you want to carry on...

01:11:25.297 --> 01:11:26.422
...we can work it out.

01:11:27.088 --> 01:11:28.088
You're good.

01:11:28.672 --> 01:11:29.672
You're reliable.

01:11:30.588 --> 01:11:31.547
Ideal.

01:11:34.297 --> 01:11:35.297
It's not for me.

01:11:35.672 --> 01:11:36.838
What is, then?

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.838
Miguel, just keep your word.

01:11:44.047 --> 01:11:45.088
We said 2 months.

01:11:46.213 --> 01:11:47.463
It's my last delivery.

01:11:48.088 --> 01:11:49.005
OK.

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:52.005
I'll keep my word.

01:11:54.547 --> 01:11:55.630
But think about it.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.338
There are more and more unemployed.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.380
You have a kid. Think of the future.

01:12:03.588 --> 01:12:04.588
So, think it over.

01:12:40.547 --> 01:12:42.088
Sofiane said you're not working.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.505
Did you get fired?

01:12:47.755 --> 01:12:48.838
No, not at all.

01:12:51.297 --> 01:12:52.338
Tony, what's going on?

01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:54.838
Nothing.

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:59.088
Moussa told me what you're doing.

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:11.338
You shouldn't have.

01:13:13.463 --> 01:13:14.713
You needed help.

01:13:17.047 --> 01:13:18.047
Tell them you quit.

01:13:23.547 --> 01:13:25.547
- I'll tell them.
- Leyla!

01:13:26.547 --> 01:13:28.047
Listen to me.

01:13:32.255 --> 01:13:34.755
I only have one delivery to do.
The last one.

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:37.963
Then, I'm done.

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:43.047
Let me be there for you.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.130
EDEN

01:14:56.547 --> 01:14:58.422
- I'm outside.
- <i>See the Audi?</i>

01:14:59.797 --> 01:15:01.422
- <i>Go under the metal shutter.</i>
- OK.

01:15:29.047 --> 01:15:30.047
Hurry up.

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380
Here.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.505
Tell Miguel we'll order more now.

01:16:13.047 --> 01:16:14.463
- More?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.922 --> 01:16:17.672
- How much more?
- Double.

01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:19.297
OK.

01:16:21.213 --> 01:16:22.047
Guys.

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.588
- Check they've gone.
- What?

01:16:34.297 --> 01:16:35.297
Through the hole.

01:16:46.255 --> 01:16:47.672
Miguel, it's me.

01:16:48.422 --> 01:16:50.963
Look, the Bellata brothers
want double now.

01:16:55.088 --> 01:16:56.755
OK, up to you.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.713
You got it.

01:17:01.422 --> 01:17:02.297
They've gone.

01:17:05.047 --> 01:17:05.922
I'm going, too.

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.880
9 PM tomorrow.

01:17:12.505 --> 01:17:13.422
What did you say?

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.672
The parlor, 9 PM tomorrow.

01:17:19.505 --> 01:17:20.338
No.

01:17:23.422 --> 01:17:25.255
We said two months. I've finished.

01:17:26.047 --> 01:17:27.755
You haven't finished. You carry on.

01:17:31.463 --> 01:17:32.672
You don't understand.

01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.130
I have a deal with Miguel.

01:17:40.338 --> 01:17:42.005
- Call him.
- Shut up!

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.130
Shut up.

01:17:43.422 --> 01:17:46.380
If I say you carry on, you carry on.
Now fuck off.

01:17:53.922 --> 01:17:54.755
Screw you.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:56.880
Here's this shit back.

01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:08.922
I say when you've finished.
I say. Have you got that?

01:18:10.297 --> 01:18:12.838
Don't play tough or I'll kill your chick.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:14.422
I'll kill her!

01:18:41.255 --> 01:18:42.213
What d'ya want?

01:18:42.588 --> 01:18:43.672
The phone.

01:18:59.755 --> 01:19:00.755
Get off.

01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:49.213
Shit.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:52.922
Tony.

01:19:55.713 --> 01:19:56.547
Can you hear me?

01:19:57.963 --> 01:19:58.838
What a mess!

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:01.588
Smart-ass!

01:20:19.588 --> 01:20:20.547
You're in the shit.

01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.880
Think Miguel won't find out?

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:28.463
Hey!

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:32.672
Wanna take Miguel's place?

01:20:36.422 --> 01:20:37.588
I can find his hideout.

01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:39.672
Where he hides his gear.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:44.588
You know?

01:20:45.297 --> 01:20:46.463
I know how to find it.

01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:50.672
Get his keys.

01:20:52.588 --> 01:20:53.547
Do as I say.

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:56.755
Kenji!

01:20:57.547 --> 01:20:58.672
Get his keys.

01:22:36.755 --> 01:22:38.630
- What is it?
- Are you alone?

01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:40.505
- Yeah.
- Upstairs.

01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:43.922
Move.

01:22:47.172 --> 01:22:48.172
Serge.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.505
- Have a look.
- Why?

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.505
Come here.

01:23:05.255 --> 01:23:06.630
What happened last night?

01:23:07.005 --> 01:23:07.838
What?

01:23:08.172 --> 01:23:11.047
What happened with the Bellata brothers?

01:23:12.463 --> 01:23:13.588
It went as planned.

01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:16.130
No problems?

01:23:17.505 --> 01:23:18.630
Did they pay up?

01:23:19.297 --> 01:23:20.130
Yeah.

01:23:20.338 --> 01:23:23.088
I was with Jordan when he called you.

01:23:25.547 --> 01:23:27.213
What's the problem?

01:23:27.422 --> 01:23:28.755
Where's Jordan now?

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.713
I don't know.

01:23:36.213 --> 01:23:38.588
- Where is he?
- I don't know, I swear.

01:23:38.672 --> 01:23:40.213
He's not home. His phone's off.

01:23:40.713 --> 01:23:43.505
- What happened?
- The guys left...

01:23:43.588 --> 01:23:46.380
I know. I called them. What happened next?

01:23:46.463 --> 01:23:47.797
I left.

01:23:48.463 --> 01:23:49.338
And Jordan?

01:23:49.422 --> 01:23:52.255
Jordan stayed on to see Farid.

01:23:54.713 --> 01:23:55.880
To see Farid?

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.297
Yeah.

01:24:01.088 --> 01:24:02.922
- Been to the hideout?
- No.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.213
Let's go.

01:24:07.713 --> 01:24:09.505
- Come with us.
- Why?

01:24:09.797 --> 01:24:10.672
Don't argue.

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:10.838
Hey.

01:25:12.005 --> 01:25:14.130
Find Jordan and his pal Farid.

01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:16.255
Find them fast.

01:25:16.838 --> 01:25:17.880
And call me back.

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.422
Not too close.

01:26:01.505 --> 01:26:02.422
Go on.

01:26:06.672 --> 01:26:07.797
Move!

01:26:13.713 --> 01:26:15.172
Go onto the sidewalk.

01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:18.713
Fuck!

01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:21.880
Have you lost them?

01:26:29.963 --> 01:26:31.005
Where are we going?

01:27:04.297 --> 01:27:05.297
Come on.

01:27:23.922 --> 01:27:24.755
It's all here.

01:27:24.838 --> 01:27:25.797
Right here.

01:27:29.172 --> 01:27:30.422
Where the fuck are they?!

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:12.130
What's up?
Wasn't that one of Miguel's guys?

01:28:12.922 --> 01:28:14.630
- The guy that just left?
- Yeah.

01:28:14.838 --> 01:28:16.505
- He was looking for Farid.
- Really?

01:28:18.005 --> 01:28:19.922
Overtake this fucker!

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:23.338
- Yeah.
- Problem.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880

But I found his pal Farid.

- In jail.

01:28:58.755 --> 01:29:02.880

It's over. It's all over.

01:32:55.005 --> 01:32:56.297
Finish him off!

<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:35:03.838 --> 01:35:05.838
What about Mom's Portuguese accent?

01:35:07.213 --> 01:35:08.297
She's worked at it!

01:35:11.547 --> 01:35:13.172
What's my birthday present?

01:35:14.213 --> 01:35:15.963
You'll get it at home.

01:35:16.922 --> 01:35:18.172
We'll have a party later.

01:35:34.005 --> 01:35:35.255
I'm going to bed.

01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:44.505
Goodnight.

Alright.
