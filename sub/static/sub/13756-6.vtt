01:52.419 --> 01:55.620
High temperatures will remain
in the mid to upper 50s.

01:55.722 --> 01:58.289
Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy, windy, and mild,

01:58.391 --> 02:00.725
with scattered showers
and high temperatures...

02:13.173 --> 02:14.839
That's better, huh?

02:18.111 --> 02:20.511
More violence in Jackson
Heights this morning,

02:20.580 --> 02:22.713
this time against a Pakistani driver

02:22.816 --> 02:25.616
dragged from his car
and beaten with bricks.

02:25.718 --> 02:27.618
Police are calling it a hate crime,

02:27.720 --> 02:30.621
adding they believe the
motivation for the attack

02:30.723 --> 02:32.356
is the Nasir Khan case.

02:32.459 --> 02:37.128
Mr. Khan is on trial for the stabbing
murder of Andrea Cornish.

02:48.241 --> 02:49.373
That's for you.

02:53.513 --> 02:55.513
The good one.

02:55.615 --> 02:56.948
Go ahead, take it.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.382
You earned it.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.386
Did a good thing.

03:09.095 --> 03:10.628
Call your family.

03:11.965 --> 03:13.231
Thank you.

03:15.869 --> 03:18.202
So, how they doing?

03:20.840 --> 03:23.908
I mean, they don't complain or nothing,

03:24.010 --> 03:25.877
but not good.

03:28.047 --> 03:29.680
Nah, it's okay.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.397
Family's everything.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.824
Safar Khan.

04:50.597 --> 04:53.731
My experience is in retail sales.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.299
I can see that.

04:55.401 --> 04:59.303
Unfortunately, I don't have
anything like that at the moment. I...

05:02.342 --> 05:03.874
You're the mother of that...

05:03.977 --> 05:06.644
Yes. And it was why I was let go,

05:06.746 --> 05:08.346
the only reason.

05:11.317 --> 05:13.517
What jobs do you have available?

05:15.121 --> 05:17.188
What are you willing to do?

05:25.732 --> 05:27.031
What in particular?

05:27.133 --> 05:28.799
Facebook, if he's on it.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.501
Who on Earth isn't?

05:30.603 --> 05:32.270
Me.

05:34.274 --> 05:36.674
You hear Bob Rooney's kid
just got his gold shield?

05:36.776 --> 05:39.644
Christ, how old was
he when he had him, 12?

05:39.746 --> 05:42.046
Kid's 28, Tommy. The math is good.

05:42.148 --> 05:44.815
Earlier, before this.

05:44.917 --> 05:47.118
Hey, Dennis, when's your big day?

05:47.220 --> 05:48.586
Not soon enough.

05:48.688 --> 05:49.854
Yeah, I'll bet.

05:49.956 --> 05:52.056
What are you gonna do with
yourself, play golf?

05:52.158 --> 05:53.791
Uh-huh.

05:56.029 --> 05:58.095
"You're a lifesaver."

05:58.197 --> 06:00.865
"You're a friend indeed."

06:00.967 --> 06:02.533
"You dah man."

06:04.537 --> 06:07.038
"Owe you big time, bro."

06:08.141 --> 06:09.874
For what, I wonder?

06:11.577 --> 06:13.311
Amir...

06:22.088 --> 06:24.789
Yo, use your bike?

06:24.891 --> 06:26.057
What?

06:26.159 --> 06:27.491
Your cell, man.

06:27.593 --> 06:29.393
I need to make a call.

06:29.495 --> 06:30.928
What cell?

06:33.066 --> 06:35.066
Stupid-ass motherfucker.

06:41.908 --> 06:43.808
What are you looking for?

06:43.910 --> 06:45.876
How out of his mind he was.

06:45.978 --> 06:49.347
Well, this is some cocktail,
I'll tell you that.

06:49.449 --> 06:51.415
Too high to know what he was doing?

06:51.517 --> 06:53.384
That depends on the individual.

06:53.486 --> 06:54.819
I've had patients this fucked up

06:54.921 --> 06:57.621
who could fly 747s
through five time zones,

06:57.724 --> 06:59.644
others who couldn't lift
their head off the floor

06:59.692 --> 07:01.425
if their life depended on it.

07:01.527 --> 07:03.427
Which are you interested in?

07:04.397 --> 07:06.063
The aviators.

07:55.381 --> 07:57.681
Okay.

08:15.802 --> 08:18.469
Well, can you help me?

08:20.773 --> 08:22.006
Yes.

08:35.121 --> 08:37.221
For feet, for sex.

08:37.323 --> 08:40.256
Mix water. $300.

08:40.359 --> 08:41.592
Does it taste okay?

08:41.693 --> 08:43.027
No.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.196
Credit card okay?

08:45.298 --> 08:46.464
No.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.951
Hey, yo.

09:07.053 --> 09:09.854
Dude asked you to use
that cell phone I gave you.

09:11.190 --> 09:12.756
Why'd you say no?

09:12.859 --> 09:14.325
'Cause it's mine.

09:16.529 --> 09:17.695
What?

09:17.797 --> 09:18.996
What?

09:19.098 --> 09:22.867
Think I was just trying to save
you a trip to the pay phone?

09:22.969 --> 09:24.568
It's a cash machine, dummy.

09:24.670 --> 09:26.637
Ten dollars a minute.

09:26.739 --> 09:27.872
Oh.

09:27.974 --> 09:29.406
"Oh."

09:31.310 --> 09:33.944
I'm gonna make a proper
convict out of you yet.

12:04.397 --> 12:07.197
Hold the belly button up in the air.

12:07.299 --> 12:08.999
Great. You can do it.

12:09.101 --> 12:12.870
Every minute you've got
to move to your best ability.

12:12.972 --> 12:14.338
Last one.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.740
Take it down now. Stretch it out...

12:16.842 --> 12:18.042
Mr. Day?

12:21.013 --> 12:23.113
Hi. My name's Chandra.

12:23.215 --> 12:25.582
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute?

12:28.854 --> 12:31.121
Nah, I don't have a minute.
I got work to do.

12:33.325 --> 12:34.591
I'm not here to cause trouble.

12:34.694 --> 12:36.460
I just need some information.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.400
Is there somewhere else we could talk?

12:49.308 --> 12:52.042
She the one got killed in the papers.

12:52.144 --> 12:55.312
She's the one you saw
the night she got killed.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.084
At the gas station.

13:03.456 --> 13:05.255
There's a security tape.

13:10.196 --> 13:11.962
What was going on there?

13:12.932 --> 13:14.498
You know.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.301
I don't.

13:18.304 --> 13:22.940
She had that vibration some women got.

13:23.042 --> 13:26.577
Next thing you know, they're dead.

13:26.679 --> 13:28.145
Like that.

13:30.249 --> 13:31.782
Vibration?

13:32.852 --> 13:36.420
Like she the cat, and you the yarn.

13:39.358 --> 13:41.992
Women like that out to destroy you.

13:42.094 --> 13:45.496
Sometimes you got no choice but to strike
first. You know what I'm saying?

13:48.400 --> 13:51.435
Like, uh, she deserved it?

13:52.772 --> 13:54.705
Like it's a given with women like that

13:54.807 --> 13:56.807
to think they're God's gift,

13:56.909 --> 13:58.976
and you ain't nothing but a plaything...

14:00.012 --> 14:02.813
until they find out
otherwise, like she did.

14:11.924 --> 14:14.725
You talked to her there, why?

14:16.362 --> 14:18.695
Because I saw her for
the destroyer that she was

14:18.798 --> 14:20.731
and I did not like that.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.534
Sometimes when you call
them out, they get neutralized.

14:30.943 --> 14:33.710
Do you remember the man she was with?

14:34.947 --> 14:38.749
That wasn't no man,
that was a ball of yarn.

14:42.955 --> 14:45.155
Where did you go after that?

14:55.901 --> 14:58.402
Where'd I go?

14:58.504 --> 15:00.003
Really?

15:00.105 --> 15:01.905
That's where you wanna go?

15:04.109 --> 15:05.742
- You a cat, too?
- No.

15:05.845 --> 15:07.477
You think I'm a ball of yarn?

15:07.580 --> 15:08.745
No.

15:08.848 --> 15:11.682
I've dealt with females
like you my whole life

15:11.784 --> 15:13.150
and I'm still here.

15:13.252 --> 15:15.419
You know how?

15:15.521 --> 15:17.187
Read your Bible.

15:20.526 --> 15:23.093
Judges 16.

15:23.195 --> 15:25.762
That's all a man need to know.

16:47.346 --> 16:49.513
Oh, God.

16:59.325 --> 17:02.225
I'm not interested in
being saved, thank you.

17:07.598 --> 17:09.566
What's wrong?

17:12.371 --> 17:15.405
"The Lords of the Philistines
came to her with silver.

17:15.507 --> 17:17.907
And after putting him
to sleep in her lap,

17:18.010 --> 17:21.178
she called for someone to
shave off his seven braids.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.048
And so his strength left him.

17:25.150 --> 17:27.050
And she said to him,

17:27.152 --> 17:29.953
The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.'

17:30.055 --> 17:31.955
And they bound him in shackles,

17:32.057 --> 17:35.959
brought him to Gaza
and gouged out his eyes."

17:36.061 --> 17:38.061
That's what he thinks of women.

17:38.163 --> 17:40.430
And he followed them in his hearse.

17:40.532 --> 17:41.798
You don't know that.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.102
He waited for them to
leave. There's no other reason.

17:46.739 --> 17:49.606
And the cops haven't even
bothered talking to him.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.508
But you did.

17:53.512 --> 17:55.712
His eyes...

17:55.814 --> 17:58.915
Everything about him is so creepy.

17:59.018 --> 18:02.953
Next time, when you
want to talk to somebody,

18:03.055 --> 18:04.988
let me do it.

18:05.090 --> 18:06.923
You want a drink?

18:07.026 --> 18:08.859
Oh, forgot, no alcohol.

18:08.961 --> 18:11.728
That's Muslims. I'll drink anything.

18:13.032 --> 18:17.534
Next time, leave the
Nancy Drew work to me.

18:18.837 --> 18:20.771
He's really scary, John.

18:23.042 --> 18:24.975
And I gave him my card.

18:50.936 --> 18:54.204
Chasen High School,
that's in the Bronx, right?

18:54.306 --> 18:56.073
Yeah, off Fordham Road.

18:56.175 --> 19:00.811
Great basketball team,
lousy metal detectors.

19:00.913 --> 19:02.834
So why would a kid transfer out of a

19:02.859 --> 19:05.039
school half-a-dozen
blocks from his house

19:05.117 --> 19:07.784
to another one 40 minutes
away by subway?

19:07.886 --> 19:09.886
To Chasen?

19:09.988 --> 19:13.523
Well, not for the
robotics club, I'll tell you that.

19:14.893 --> 19:17.127
Probably didn't have a choice.

19:40.352 --> 19:44.654
His name was Nasir
Khan. Maybe you remember him.

19:44.756 --> 19:47.224
Yeah. I remember him well.

19:47.326 --> 19:50.660
He made the basketball team,
but I didn't play him too much.

19:50.762 --> 19:53.096
He left in the middle
of the ninth grade.

19:53.198 --> 19:55.465
Yeah, he got into a fight
with another kid.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.868
Wound up throwing him
down a flight of stairs.

19:57.970 --> 19:59.069
Broke his arm.

19:59.171 --> 20:01.838
But it could have just
as easily been his skull.

20:01.940 --> 20:02.906
No kidding.

20:03.008 --> 20:04.674
They suspended him
for a couple of weeks,

20:04.776 --> 20:06.977
but when he came back,
it was just as bad,

20:07.079 --> 20:08.912
so he was transferred out.

20:13.685 --> 20:15.552
Thanks. I appreciate your time.

20:15.654 --> 20:17.053
You're welcome.

20:25.831 --> 20:27.697
Thanks, Greer.

20:27.799 --> 20:30.400
Jury selection isn't about selection.

20:30.502 --> 20:34.004
It's about getting rid
of your nightmares.

20:34.106 --> 20:36.106
Anyone from law enforcement.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.441
Anyone from a law enforcement family.

20:38.544 --> 20:40.777
Anyone from a military family.

20:40.879 --> 20:42.746
No small business owners.

20:42.848 --> 20:44.481
No working-class whites.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.250
No elderly blacks.
They're tired of getting mugged.

20:47.352 --> 20:50.954
No one who knows anyone killed on 9/11.

20:51.056 --> 20:53.023
No one who listens to Fox News.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.458
No golfers, no bowlers, no sailors,

20:55.561 --> 20:58.061
and absolutely no lawyers.

21:00.165 --> 21:01.464
Are you listening to me?

21:01.567 --> 21:03.667
Yeah. Can I get another of these?

21:03.769 --> 21:04.801
Yup.

21:15.547 --> 21:17.380
I broke up with my boyfriend.

21:17.482 --> 21:19.382
Oh.

21:22.387 --> 21:24.988
Fuck that. Who cares? This is important.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.490
Educated liberals are good,

21:27.593 --> 21:29.926
unless they got a kid
died of an overdose.

21:30.028 --> 21:32.462
Jews, but not religious ones.

21:32.564 --> 21:34.898
Well, for this case it's complicated.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.999
Same with Muslims.

21:36.101 --> 21:37.701
Still, they tend to be...

21:37.803 --> 21:39.502
I don't know. Who
the hell knows anymore.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.937
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

21:41.039 --> 21:43.006
You know who you really want?

21:43.108 --> 21:45.408
The prize of all prizes...

21:45.510 --> 21:48.044
Young, urban women.

21:48.146 --> 21:51.615
Mmm. Because they don't give a shit
about anyone's opinion but their own.

21:51.717 --> 21:54.084
And odds are one of them's
gonna be on our side,

21:54.186 --> 21:55.652
just by accident.

21:55.754 --> 21:58.321
And all we need is one.

21:59.324 --> 22:01.891
Young, urban women. Well phrased.

22:01.994 --> 22:03.860
I try.

22:20.312 --> 22:22.612
Look, I get it.

22:22.714 --> 22:26.049
Love is passion, it's fleeting,

22:26.151 --> 22:27.617
it's trouble.

22:29.454 --> 22:32.689
"Paradise by the Dashboard Lights."

22:33.892 --> 22:35.125
What?

22:37.529 --> 22:39.162
You screw up, you break up,

22:39.264 --> 22:41.331
you get divorced. I did.

22:42.701 --> 22:44.868
It's not the end of the world.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.541
You're alone.

22:54.446 --> 22:57.580
Well, so are you, now.

23:08.593 --> 23:10.760
Can I get another of these?

23:11.730 --> 23:13.196
Greer.

23:14.499 --> 23:16.032
She's done.

23:19.905 --> 23:22.005
Why no sailors?

23:23.909 --> 23:26.576
While one officer leads
Marilyn out of the bedroom,

23:26.678 --> 23:28.945
the other continues the luminol testing.

23:29.047 --> 23:31.047
What he finds could be proof

23:31.149 --> 23:33.316
that something violent happened there.

23:33.418 --> 23:36.086
There are visible positive results...

23:36.188 --> 23:37.287
Yo, it's Gooden.

23:37.389 --> 23:39.155
Can't come to the phone right now.

23:39.257 --> 23:40.690
You can leave a message.

23:42.527 --> 23:44.928
Hey, Gooden, it's Dad again.

23:45.030 --> 23:46.229
What are you doing?

23:46.331 --> 23:49.566
You wanna come over? We
could stay in, watch TV,

23:49.668 --> 23:52.836
go out to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
whatever you want.

23:52.938 --> 23:54.804
What do you say?

23:54.906 --> 23:56.973
Call me.

23:57.075 --> 23:58.575
I love you.

23:58.677 --> 24:00.955
...to help you search for any
kind of biological evidence.

24:00.979 --> 24:04.247
Then, according to police,
further disruptions...

24:22.367 --> 24:24.567
Your presence here today
makes it possible

24:24.669 --> 24:26.469
for the court to select a jury

24:26.571 --> 24:29.706
from a representative sample
of our community.

24:29.808 --> 24:32.342
If it wasn't for people like you,

24:32.444 --> 24:34.310
we would not be able to make real

24:34.413 --> 24:36.246
the Constitution's guarantee

24:36.348 --> 24:38.648
of the right to trial by jury.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.817
This right is included
in our Bill of Rights,

24:40.919 --> 24:43.386
and guaranteed by the sixth
and seventh amendments

24:43.488 --> 24:45.288
to the United States Constitution.

24:49.761 --> 24:50.894
Yo, Marcus.

24:50.996 --> 24:52.195
Qué pasa, jefe?

24:53.331 --> 24:55.799
Did your boy tell you about Steven Diaz?

24:55.901 --> 24:57.033
Who?

24:57.135 --> 24:59.235
Schoolmate at Flushing High.

24:59.337 --> 25:02.272
Threw him down a flight of stairs.

25:02.374 --> 25:03.940
Almost killed him.

25:20.025 --> 25:21.291
Stick 'em up.

25:21.393 --> 25:22.525
Mmm.

25:24.262 --> 25:25.128
What's that?

25:25.230 --> 25:27.197
Board of Education incident report

25:27.299 --> 25:29.299
for violent behavior.

25:30.435 --> 25:32.001
Our golden boy.

25:33.939 --> 25:36.005
He lied to us again.

25:46.351 --> 25:49.219
I was in fifth grade
when the towers came down.

25:49.321 --> 25:51.855
I didn't understand
why I was getting beat up,

25:51.957 --> 25:53.423
why my little brother was,

25:53.525 --> 25:56.926
why my dad got jumped in his cab twice.

25:58.797 --> 26:00.930
Pakistani kids, North African,

26:01.032 --> 26:03.466
any type of Muslim...
It was a slaughterhouse.

26:03.568 --> 26:06.402
You try to fight back,
it only made it worse.

26:10.008 --> 26:11.841
I didn't have a fight with Steve Diaz.

26:11.943 --> 26:13.776
I just shoved him down those stairs.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.779
Why? Because I just did.

26:16.882 --> 26:19.282
I wish I could tell you something
else, but I just did it.

26:20.752 --> 26:22.952
It was like...

26:23.054 --> 26:25.755
like pushing open a door.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.557
You just push it.

26:30.095 --> 26:32.028
You know what I felt after?

26:33.899 --> 26:35.565
Bad for my mom.

26:36.568 --> 26:38.334
She never understood it.

26:38.436 --> 26:39.569
To this day, doesn't.

26:39.671 --> 26:40.904
She was just like,

26:41.006 --> 26:42.372
"Why, Naz? Why'd you do it?

26:42.474 --> 26:44.641
This isn't you. I don't understand."

26:47.445 --> 26:49.279
Other than that, I felt nothing.

26:54.352 --> 26:56.119
You look at me like she did.

26:57.522 --> 26:59.889
"Why, Naz?"

27:01.259 --> 27:03.893
No. I understand it.

27:05.196 --> 27:07.597
It wasn't so easy for me, either.

27:09.267 --> 27:11.134
You understand that.

27:12.437 --> 27:14.671
But maybe I did kill that girl.

27:16.575 --> 27:18.341
That's what you're thinking.

27:19.578 --> 27:20.677
No.

27:24.916 --> 27:26.783
No.

28:15.867 --> 28:17.533
Big day tomorrow.

28:21.373 --> 28:23.272
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:23.375 --> 28:24.974
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

28:25.076 --> 28:26.142
hello, I'm Chandra Kapoor,

28:26.244 --> 28:28.678
and I'm defending Mr. Nasir Khan.

28:30.015 --> 28:31.481
Oh, my God.

28:42.327 --> 28:44.160
Nick, Midleton.

29:20.865 --> 29:22.532
- Yeah?
- How's it coming along?

29:22.634 --> 29:23.766
I'm working on it.

29:23.868 --> 29:25.034
Read it to me.

29:25.136 --> 29:26.302
Nothing to read yet.

29:26.404 --> 29:27.470
I'll come over.

29:27.572 --> 29:28.771
No, I got it.

29:28.873 --> 29:31.441
Look, an opening statement's a memo,

29:31.543 --> 29:33.176
not the Gettysburg Address.

29:33.278 --> 29:36.345
Get up there, tell 'em the burden
of proof is on the State,

29:36.448 --> 29:39.115
quote the
Constitution, get off the stage.

29:39.217 --> 29:41.150
Short and sweet. People have busy lives.

29:41.252 --> 29:42.719
Don't read 'em "War and Peace."

29:42.821 --> 29:44.721
I got it.

29:49.194 --> 29:50.960
Oh, God.

29:51.062 --> 29:52.762
A young woman gets in a cab,

29:52.864 --> 29:56.999
little does she know this is the
last cab ride she will ever take.

29:57.102 --> 30:00.036
She gets in, tells the driver
where she wants to go,

30:00.138 --> 30:02.705
just like we've all
done a million times.

30:02.807 --> 30:06.776
She's just 22 years old, and she's dead.

30:41.613 --> 30:44.313
$18.50.

30:45.717 --> 30:46.949
Um...

30:50.088 --> 30:52.054
I'll be... I'll be right back.

31:35.133 --> 31:36.199
Yo.

31:36.301 --> 31:39.602
Thank you, but my mom's
bringing me clothes.

31:41.105 --> 31:44.574
Yeah, but they won't be right.

31:48.146 --> 31:49.278
Thank you.

31:52.450 --> 31:54.016
Your funeral.

33:19.637 --> 33:20.903
Hey.

33:21.005 --> 33:22.249
You're not gonna believe this...

33:22.273 --> 33:24.206
Don't talk to me. I'm
working on my opening.

33:24.309 --> 33:26.776
Now?

33:26.878 --> 33:28.344
Look.

33:30.481 --> 33:32.381
Hey. Hey.

33:32.483 --> 33:34.016
Look.

33:35.019 --> 33:36.319
I went to this Chinese guy.

33:36.421 --> 33:39.722
He gave me some kind of
tree bark or fish powder.

33:39.824 --> 33:41.791
I don't know what the fuck it was,

33:41.893 --> 33:43.993
but it just...

33:44.095 --> 33:45.628
Huh.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.598
What the hell is this?

34:22.699 --> 34:25.634
You look like an extra
from "West Side Story."

34:25.737 --> 34:28.204
Cheryl, get those cuffs off him.

34:28.306 --> 34:29.538
Give him to me for a minute.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.672
Thanks. Let's go.

34:30.775 --> 34:31.975
- What?
- Come on. Take it off.

34:32.043 --> 34:33.842
Take it off. Your shirt.
What? You kidding me?

34:33.878 --> 34:36.078
I'm not kidding. It doesn't look good.

34:36.179 --> 34:38.447
You can't wear royal blue
in a courtroom, okay?

34:38.549 --> 34:41.069
You gotta wear a white shirt. The
defendant wears a white shirt.

34:41.152 --> 34:42.318
That's not a white shirt.

34:42.420 --> 34:45.087
Well, it's whiter than yours. Come on.

34:45.188 --> 34:48.924
I've done this
before. It's the wrong color.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.262
The jury, they're coming in.

34:53.364 --> 34:55.630
That's all right. They don't
know what's going on.

34:57.135 --> 34:59.035
Just relax. They don't know who you are.

34:59.137 --> 35:00.970
Just two guys.

35:02.173 --> 35:03.506
Relax. Okay.

35:03.608 --> 35:05.508
- But it looks stupid.
- It doesn't look stupid.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.675
Okay?

35:06.778 --> 35:08.878
The shirt you have on looks good.

35:12.550 --> 35:14.150
All rise.

35:17.622 --> 35:19.255
Let's go. Come on.

35:23.094 --> 35:24.660
Good morning, everybody.

35:24.762 --> 35:26.162
Have a seat.

35:43.981 --> 35:46.315
Good morning, jurors.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.417
My name is Helen Weiss.

35:48.519 --> 35:51.554
I work for the District
Attorney of New York.

35:51.656 --> 35:55.257
But my real employer,
as I come before you today,

35:55.359 --> 35:57.860
is a young woman who lies in a grave

35:57.962 --> 35:59.995
at St. Raymond's Cemetery.

36:00.098 --> 36:03.099
It's my job for her to speak to you,

36:03.201 --> 36:06.902
to take you on a tour of her
final, desperate hours.

36:07.004 --> 36:11.941
On it you will visit every
stop she visited with the defendant

36:12.043 --> 36:15.578
on his cold,
calculating itinerary that night,

36:15.680 --> 36:19.148
which started with a
stolen car in Queens,

36:19.250 --> 36:21.584
and ended with a young woman

36:21.686 --> 36:26.355
brutally stabbed to death in her bed.

36:26.457 --> 36:29.358
Before I take you on this
tour through hell,

36:29.460 --> 36:31.760
a word to the wise.

36:31.863 --> 36:36.999
Be not distracted by
Mr. Khan's benign appearance

36:37.101 --> 36:41.537
as he sits here with us
in his dress shirt and tie,

36:41.639 --> 36:43.806
nor by attempts by his attorneys

36:43.908 --> 36:47.009
to linger on the
victim's personal struggles

36:47.111 --> 36:50.012
in her all-too-brief life.

36:50.114 --> 36:53.516
This case isn't about Andrea's life.

36:56.187 --> 36:58.254
It's about her death.

37:15.873 --> 37:19.141
Mrs. Weiss... she prefers
to be called "missus,"

37:19.243 --> 37:23.345
gets to take you on her tour
before I can take you on mine.

37:23.447 --> 37:26.015
And that's fine. That's how it works.

37:26.117 --> 37:29.518
The State gets to go first,
then the Defense.

37:29.620 --> 37:33.889
All I ask is you keep an open
mind and remember this,

37:33.991 --> 37:38.827
there is no burden on me to prove to
you the defendant didn't commit the crime.

37:38.930 --> 37:44.633
The burden is on the State
to prove he did. Thank you.

37:52.476 --> 37:54.276
In the normal course of a day,

37:54.378 --> 37:57.846
what percentage of the
vehicles approaching the Midtown Tunnel

37:57.949 --> 37:59.915
is recorded by security cameras?

38:00.017 --> 38:01.450
A hundred percent.

38:01.552 --> 38:04.853
This one came through on October 24th

38:04.956 --> 38:07.022
at 9:17 p.m. it says there.

38:07.124 --> 38:08.624
And there's an E-ZPass record

38:08.726 --> 38:10.526
of the same vehicle at the same time.

38:10.628 --> 38:12.394
- This.
- Yes.

38:12.496 --> 38:15.631
Same plate
registration, medallion, and VIN.

38:15.733 --> 38:17.967
Have you checked the
plates and registration

38:18.069 --> 38:19.535
to see who owns this cab?

38:19.637 --> 38:24.373
Yes. Yousef Bashir,
Tariq Mazari, and Salim Khan.

38:24.475 --> 38:27.910
Which of them was driving it the
night it came into Manhattan?

38:28.012 --> 38:29.979
None of them.

38:32.717 --> 38:35.718
He seemed upset that these
guys wouldn't get out of his cab.

38:35.820 --> 38:37.253
He wanted them out,

38:37.355 --> 38:39.054
in no uncertain terms?

38:39.156 --> 38:40.589
Yeah.

38:44.595 --> 38:45.995
There they go.

38:52.637 --> 38:55.104
One of those bottles looks like water,

38:55.206 --> 38:57.206
but I can't tell what the other is,

38:57.308 --> 38:58.474
can you?

38:59.910 --> 39:01.443
Beer.

39:01.545 --> 39:03.479
Whose DNA is on this?

39:03.581 --> 39:06.282
The defendant, the victim's or both?

39:06.384 --> 39:08.217
Only the victim's.

39:08.319 --> 39:09.551
Okay.

39:09.654 --> 39:13.055
So, after buying her beer in Harlem,

39:13.157 --> 39:15.624
he drove her to West 87th Street,

39:15.726 --> 39:19.728
according to this parking violation
issued at 1:55 a.m.

39:19.830 --> 39:22.498
Whose blood is on this?

39:22.600 --> 39:24.733
The defendant's.

39:24.835 --> 39:27.136
Any chance you could be wrong?

39:27.238 --> 39:30.806
Yes, one in five billion.

40:12.416 --> 40:14.550
Well, what's this doctor's name?

40:14.652 --> 40:16.218
Doctor Yee.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.420
Y-E-E.

40:18.522 --> 40:22.024
The guy is a miracle
worker. He's Anne Sullivan!

40:22.126 --> 40:26.228
Three hundred dollars,
and he throws in aphrodisiacs.

40:33.871 --> 40:35.637
You know why I'm here?

40:37.508 --> 40:39.808
I don't ask that question.

40:39.910 --> 40:42.177
I mean, here, Rikers.

40:42.279 --> 40:44.213
Not up north at Clinton.

40:46.384 --> 40:49.651
Took my wife seven hours
on a Greyhound bus

40:49.754 --> 40:52.254
traveling with the kids to come see me.

40:53.991 --> 40:56.558
So I got a dude in my crew

40:56.660 --> 40:59.161
to put another body on me.

40:59.263 --> 41:01.830
New charge, new trial,
know what I'm saying?

41:03.701 --> 41:05.901
So now I'm back down here,

41:06.003 --> 41:08.670
bus ride's only 20 minutes away.

41:08.773 --> 41:12.141
What's one more murder charge,
the fuck I care, right?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.348
Yo, let me ask you something.

41:22.620 --> 41:24.620
Did you like your life out there?

41:26.023 --> 41:27.623
My life?

41:27.725 --> 41:29.425
Yeah.

41:29.527 --> 41:31.226
Yeah, I guess.

41:31.328 --> 41:32.594
Hmm.

41:34.298 --> 41:36.765
God's honest truth,

41:36.867 --> 41:39.935
whether you're in here or out there...

41:41.405 --> 41:43.605
you know who you are,

41:43.707 --> 41:45.841
how to get what you need.

41:47.311 --> 41:49.678
Shit, sweet can be had anywhere.

42:56.213 --> 42:59.281
Upon observing the vehicle
proceed across an intersection

42:59.383 --> 43:02.484
in violation of a posted
no left turn sign,

43:02.586 --> 43:04.186
we commenced pursuit.

43:04.288 --> 43:07.823
After pulling him over, I
requested to see his driver's license,

43:07.925 --> 43:10.859
detected the smell of alcohol,
and asked him to blow.

43:10.961 --> 43:14.730
- Blow?
- Take a BACtrack for me. Breathalyzer.

43:14.832 --> 43:15.872
That's when the call came.

43:15.933 --> 43:18.700
A break-in at 144 West 87th street.

43:18.802 --> 43:22.371
Since we were the closest car to
the address, we said we would respond.

43:22.473 --> 43:24.172
So, you let Mr. Khan go?

43:24.275 --> 43:25.707
No. We took him with us.

43:25.809 --> 43:28.810
I didn't want him driving off
in his cab given how intox he was.

43:28.913 --> 43:32.047
Objection. The officer just
said no test was given.

43:32.149 --> 43:34.283
She's got a point.

43:34.385 --> 43:35.918
If he didn't blow,

43:36.020 --> 43:38.120
how would you know
how intoxicated he was?

43:38.222 --> 43:41.089
'Cause his eyes looked like two
cherries floating in buttermilk,

43:41.191 --> 43:44.126
and he reeked like someone just dropped
a bomb in a tequila factory.

43:47.298 --> 43:49.398
Okay.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.699
Then what happened?

43:50.801 --> 43:53.602
After we arrived at the scene,
we found the victim,

43:53.704 --> 43:55.170
called for homicide.

43:55.272 --> 43:56.538
Detective Box arrived,

43:56.640 --> 43:58.774
and noticed Mr. Khan in the
back of our patrol car,

43:58.876 --> 44:01.476
and instructed that I get
someone to take him back to the house,

44:01.579 --> 44:02.644
which I did.

44:02.746 --> 44:03.745
The house?

44:03.847 --> 44:05.013
The precinct.

44:05.115 --> 44:07.015
So, he's gone now.

44:07.117 --> 44:08.750
You're still at the scene.

44:08.852 --> 44:11.153
Is that the last you saw him that night?

44:11.255 --> 44:13.622
No. Once everybody
was doing their thing,

44:13.724 --> 44:16.291
CSU, ME, we went back to the precinct.

44:16.393 --> 44:18.560
The desk sergeant
told us to cut him loose,

44:18.662 --> 44:20.996
since, at that point,
too much time had passed

44:21.065 --> 44:22.331
to test his alcohol level.

44:22.433 --> 44:23.999
So, per standard procedure,

44:24.101 --> 44:26.501
I patted him down to make
sure he wasn't armed.

44:26.604 --> 44:28.537
And that's when I found it.

44:28.639 --> 44:31.239
- It?
- That.

44:31.342 --> 44:32.674
This.

44:34.178 --> 44:36.445
In his jacket pocket.

44:36.547 --> 44:40.849
Did he try to explain how he
came to have this knife in his pocket?

44:40.951 --> 44:44.286
No. He tried to make a run for it.

44:45.389 --> 44:47.189
How far did he get?

44:47.291 --> 44:50.359
Not far, but it took two other officers
and myself to restrain him.

44:50.461 --> 44:53.362
Three trained officers?

44:53.464 --> 44:56.131
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.
Fought like a bull.

44:59.269 --> 45:00.736
- What's your name, son?
- Nasir.

45:00.838 --> 45:01.837
You don't understand.

45:01.939 --> 45:03.905
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

45:04.008 --> 45:05.607
So I will understand.

45:05.709 --> 45:07.209
Just you and me.

45:07.311 --> 45:08.377
Come over here.

45:08.479 --> 45:09.611
Please, let go, I...

45:09.713 --> 45:11.780
No, no, I didn't do it!

45:11.882 --> 45:13.815
I didn't... I didn't do it!

45:16.820 --> 45:18.453
Give me your arm! Get on the ground!

45:18.555 --> 45:20.055
Hands behind your back!

45:20.157 --> 45:21.590
Give me your arm!

45:23.160 --> 45:27.362
Before this, in your patrol car
on the way to the precinct,

45:27.464 --> 45:29.164
what was his demeanor?

45:29.266 --> 45:30.699
Quiet, mostly.

45:30.801 --> 45:32.200
Not a peep?

45:32.302 --> 45:34.102
No, he did say one thing.

45:34.204 --> 45:35.370
What did he say?

45:37.675 --> 45:39.107
Is she dead?

45:41.412 --> 45:43.178
"Is she dead?"

45:44.114 --> 45:45.414
What did you make of that?

45:45.516 --> 45:47.849
Nothing at the time 'cause
I thought he was a witness.

45:47.951 --> 45:51.019
Then Officer Wiggins pulled
the knife out of his pocket.

45:53.557 --> 45:54.756
Thank you.

45:56.326 --> 45:57.726
Your witness.

46:01.365 --> 46:02.898
"Is she dead?"

46:05.169 --> 46:06.868
Does that sound to you like something

46:06.970 --> 46:08.503
somebody would say to a police officer

46:08.605 --> 46:10.205
if he'd just committed a murder?

46:10.307 --> 46:11.173
I don't know.

46:11.275 --> 46:12.874
I once collared a rape suspect

46:12.976 --> 46:14.656
that asked to go back
to the victim's house

46:14.745 --> 46:16.478
to look for his car keys.

46:20.050 --> 46:21.283
Thank you.

46:23.754 --> 46:26.254
Dude is okay from what I understand.

46:26.356 --> 46:28.423
It's that girl I'm worried about.

46:28.525 --> 46:30.659
Too young.

46:30.761 --> 46:32.661
Well, at least she believes me.

46:34.331 --> 46:36.331
See, that's what I'm talking about.

46:37.601 --> 46:39.234
That ain't important.

46:42.873 --> 46:45.340
Only a new lawyer wouldn't know that.

47:46.870 --> 47:47.903
Hello?

47:48.005 --> 47:50.472
Hey. Hey, it's me.

47:51.408 --> 47:53.241
This caller ID said unavailable.

47:54.812 --> 47:57.045
That's pretty accurate.

47:58.882 --> 48:01.817
Oh, don't worry, it's not
being recorded. This is my cell.

48:03.253 --> 48:05.020
They allow cell phones?

48:06.523 --> 48:07.989
Okay I call you?

48:08.091 --> 48:10.192
Um, yeah.

48:10.294 --> 48:13.395
Is there a problem? Are you all right?

48:17.434 --> 48:19.154
You know, one of the things
you miss in here

48:19.203 --> 48:20.747
is being able to say
good night to someone

48:20.771 --> 48:22.704
that's not an animal in a fucking zoo.

48:24.842 --> 48:27.576
It used to be my parents
or my brother, you know?

48:29.146 --> 48:31.379
It still is, you should call them.

48:33.283 --> 48:34.783
I don't think so.

48:38.555 --> 48:40.188
Listen, I just wanted to say thank you

48:40.290 --> 48:42.357
for everything you're doing for me.

48:44.127 --> 48:46.294
And that I hope it doesn't scare you

48:46.396 --> 48:47.963
if I say...

48:56.707 --> 48:58.073
good night.

49:09.453 --> 49:11.152
Use that phone, playboy?

49:12.890 --> 49:14.389
Where's your green dot?

50:03.340 --> 50:04.606
Aah!

50:04.708 --> 50:06.141
What'd you see?

50:06.243 --> 50:07.776
Hmm?

50:07.878 --> 50:08.944
What'd you see?

50:09.046 --> 50:10.478
Nothing.

50:10.580 --> 50:11.846
What you gonna tell Freddy?

50:11.949 --> 50:13.949
Nothing. Hmm?

51:00.530 --> 51:01.496
Hey.

51:01.598 --> 51:03.698
Let me ask you something. Not now.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.734
How much you think this place is worth?

51:05.836 --> 51:07.268
Ten million?

51:07.371 --> 51:10.605
So how is it an unemployed, 22-year-old,

51:10.707 --> 51:12.674
drug-addled party girl

51:12.776 --> 51:15.343
lives there like Eloise at the Plaza?

51:15.445 --> 51:16.678
Mmm. Hmm?

52:21.011 --> 52:23.144
You're not looking
for a financial advisor.

52:23.246 --> 52:25.780
No, I don't have enough money to bother.

52:25.882 --> 52:27.816
This is about Andrea.

52:27.918 --> 52:29.350
I'm an attorney.

52:29.453 --> 52:31.152
For?

52:31.254 --> 52:33.288
Nasir Khan.

52:33.390 --> 52:36.024
- The guy who...
- Who's not been convicted.

52:36.126 --> 52:37.459
Yeah.

52:37.561 --> 52:39.861
I saw you at Andrea's funeral

52:39.963 --> 52:42.530
arguing with some guy...

52:42.632 --> 52:44.766
I didn't know at the time

52:44.868 --> 52:46.634
was her stepfather.

52:46.736 --> 52:47.976
I'm part of the fucking family!

52:48.071 --> 52:51.840
What was it about? That?

52:51.942 --> 52:54.309
Look, I really can't
talk about my clients.

52:54.411 --> 52:57.045
Like you, it's a matter
of confidentiality.

52:57.147 --> 52:58.947
Okay.

52:59.049 --> 53:01.249
Look, I was hoping
that you could help me

53:01.351 --> 53:03.118
with some, uh...

53:03.220 --> 53:06.087
background information, off the record.

53:06.189 --> 53:08.056
But if that's impossible, you know,

53:08.158 --> 53:10.558
we'll have to do it more formally

53:10.660 --> 53:13.094
with a subpoena and all that.

53:13.196 --> 53:17.165
One way or the other, I gotta do my job.

53:18.502 --> 53:19.734
Off the record.

53:21.638 --> 53:25.006
Off the record,
sitting here, just us chickens.

53:25.108 --> 53:28.042
You know, I never
understood that expression.

53:28.145 --> 53:29.911
Me neither.

53:30.981 --> 53:32.046
Close the door.

53:37.754 --> 53:42.157
Evelyn, Andrea's mother,
she was my client.

53:42.259 --> 53:44.025
When she died, Andrea came to me

53:44.127 --> 53:45.593
to help her sort things out.

53:45.695 --> 53:48.363
I mean, no 20-year-old kid
should have to deal with that,

53:48.465 --> 53:51.533
but, well, sometimes they do.

53:52.602 --> 53:54.636
One of the things I had to tell her

53:54.738 --> 53:57.839
was that her mother's husband,
of just two years,

53:57.941 --> 54:00.008
might get half of everything.

54:00.110 --> 54:02.310
I didn't know him at the time.

54:02.412 --> 54:04.245
Well, I didn't know
Andrea at the time either

54:04.347 --> 54:05.780
except for Evelyn mentioning her.

54:05.882 --> 54:09.484
But as I'm working with her
on this, then I got to know him.

54:09.586 --> 54:11.152
- Mm-hmm.
- You met him, Don?

54:11.254 --> 54:13.922
I just seen him at
the funeral, at the trial.

54:14.024 --> 54:15.624
Well, you can see just
by looking at him,

54:15.659 --> 54:18.593
he's younger than most 60-year-old
women's husbands by like, 25 years.

54:18.695 --> 54:23.665
Well, it turns out he's got quite
a history with the gray ladies. Yeah.

54:23.767 --> 54:26.501
He's got quite a history
with a few other things, too,

54:26.603 --> 54:27.902
like restraining orders.

54:28.004 --> 54:29.604
Really?

54:29.706 --> 54:31.472
He threatened me, I can tell you that.

54:31.575 --> 54:34.409
And it was fucking scary.

54:35.779 --> 54:37.579
So, here he is,

54:37.681 --> 54:39.447
personal trainer by trade,

54:39.549 --> 54:40.782
if you can call that a trade,

54:40.884 --> 54:42.684
makes 30 grand a year, if he's lucky,

54:42.786 --> 54:45.019
stops working
altogether when he marries Evelyn.

54:45.121 --> 54:46.487
Doesn't work a day after that.

54:46.590 --> 54:48.590
And he wants half of everything
Andrea's got.

54:48.692 --> 54:52.760
I mean, some kind of "Driving
Miss Daisy" gratuity, sure.

54:52.862 --> 54:55.063
But five or six million dollars?

54:55.165 --> 54:57.065
Andrea said no way.

54:58.868 --> 55:00.635
Actually...

55:04.574 --> 55:08.476
Actually, what she said
was, "Over my dead body."

55:13.850 --> 55:16.150
Guess he gets it all now.

55:33.336 --> 55:35.069
Keep going.

55:35.171 --> 55:36.271
That's right.

55:36.373 --> 55:38.039
You're getting it.

55:38.141 --> 55:40.174
You're good.

55:49.953 --> 55:52.720
So, you're here most of the time?

55:52.822 --> 55:54.022
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
