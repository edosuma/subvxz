WEBVTT

00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
â™ªâ™ª

00:07.078 --> 00:08.839
Chase, what you doing?

00:08.839 --> 00:11.082
Oh, I just reinforced
all the windows

00:11.082 --> 00:13.384
with an impenetrable polymer
I designed

00:13.384 --> 00:15.716
to keep this place safe
from any threat.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.718
Oh, yeah? Well...

00:17.718 --> 00:19.550
I just made myself
a grilled cheese.

00:21.392 --> 00:23.454
Mm, something
smells good.

00:23.454 --> 00:25.496
Yep, that's my sandwich.

00:25.496 --> 00:29.530
No, smells more like
reinforced polymer.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.702
Oh, you.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.305
Oliver!

00:34.305 --> 00:36.667
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.739
I'm still trying to get
the hang of my powers.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.511
Oh, you poor thing.

00:40.511 --> 00:42.513
It must be
so hard for you.

00:42.513 --> 00:43.874
Skylar, that's
not what I meant.

00:43.874 --> 00:45.216
No, no, no.

00:45.216 --> 00:47.078
Thank you once again
for reminding me

00:47.078 --> 00:48.619
how you have powers
and I don't.

00:53.023 --> 00:56.087
Alien chicks,
am I right?

00:56.087 --> 00:58.889
I still don't get it.

00:58.889 --> 01:00.561
If Skylar was born
a superhero,

01:00.561 --> 01:01.862
then why doesn't
she have any powers?

01:01.862 --> 01:04.395
She used to,
but a human turned mutant

01:04.395 --> 01:06.237
named the Annihilator
drained them out of her,

01:06.237 --> 01:08.139
put them on a shelf
as a trophy.

01:08.139 --> 01:11.001
Okay, I'm sorry,
but you have to agree.

01:11.001 --> 01:14.105
That just sounds
ridiculous.

01:14.105 --> 01:16.977
Look, if Skylar's gonna be
a part of this team,

01:16.977 --> 01:19.980
then I have got to
figure out a way
to get her powers back.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.952
No, I have to be the one
to get her powers back.

01:21.952 --> 01:23.254
Why you?

01:23.254 --> 01:25.586
Because. Then she falls
in love with me,

01:25.586 --> 01:27.017
then we get married,
then we live

01:27.017 --> 01:28.189
our happy little superhero
lives together forever

01:28.189 --> 01:30.321
in a space castle.

01:30.321 --> 01:33.294
You know, in your funny
yet creepy little world,

01:33.294 --> 01:34.995
I believe that could happen.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.701
I've been trying to get
her powers back for years.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.733
So far, no luck.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.104
Well, that's 'cause
you didn't have

01:44.104 --> 01:45.776
my vast scientific
knowledge to help you,

01:45.776 --> 01:47.378
and now you do.

01:47.378 --> 01:48.909
I'll even give you
all the credit

01:48.909 --> 01:50.281
so she thinks
you're the hero.

01:50.281 --> 01:52.983
Thanks, buddy.
You're the best.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.486
One day, I'm gonna do
something for you.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.852
You could start by
getting me a towel.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.472
How's it going
down here?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.874
I think I might
be on to something.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.006
If Skylar was
born with powers,

02:56.006 --> 02:57.748
then the cells that
created them

02:57.748 --> 02:59.250
are still inside her body;
they're just dormant.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.282
So if science applies,

03:01.282 --> 03:02.983
which who knows if it will,
since we're dealing with...

03:02.983 --> 03:05.956
Well, let's just
call her what she is.

03:05.956 --> 03:07.988
A freak.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.591
We might be able to
stimulate those dormant cells.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.093
Does Skylar have
any weaknesses?

03:13.093 --> 03:15.296
Nope. She's perfect.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.498
Although she'd tell you
that one of her knees
is higher than the other,

03:17.498 --> 03:19.129
but I know
that's not true.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.332
I've measured them
many, many times.

03:21.332 --> 03:24.134
I meant physical
weaknesses.

03:24.134 --> 03:26.237
Doesn't every superhero
have one?

03:26.237 --> 03:28.509
There's a chemical compound
in coal that's harmful to her.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.881
I've seen it;
it ain't pretty.

03:30.881 --> 03:32.683
I couldn't even
look at her knees.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.044
Great.

03:34.044 --> 03:36.887
Then if I use coal to
shock her immune system,

03:36.887 --> 03:38.789
it should wake up
the cells.

03:38.789 --> 03:41.121
No, Chase, you can't
give Skylar coal.
It's too dangerous.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.254
In abundance, yes.

03:43.254 --> 03:45.656
But a trace amount should
safely stimulate

03:45.656 --> 03:47.728
the regeneration
of her superpowers.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.860
Oh.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.132
I wish I had
thought of that.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.205
Good news.
You just did.

03:55.205 --> 03:58.669
Hey, Skylar,
guess what.

03:58.669 --> 04:00.311
Don't tell me.

04:00.311 --> 04:02.112
You've just discovered
another power.

04:02.112 --> 04:04.074
What now? Can you shoot
torpedoes out of your nose?

04:04.074 --> 04:07.348
No, I thought I could
a few weeks ago,

04:07.348 --> 04:09.550
but turns out it was
just a sinus infection.

04:11.021 --> 04:13.083
Anyway, I, Oliver,

04:13.083 --> 04:15.085
have been working with
some of Chase's lab equipment,

04:15.085 --> 04:18.529
and I, Oliver, think
I, Oliver,

04:18.529 --> 04:20.731
have found a way to
restore your powers.

04:20.731 --> 04:21.862
You did?

04:21.862 --> 04:25.536
Yes. I, Oliver, did.

04:25.536 --> 04:27.738
He did?

04:27.738 --> 04:30.140
Yep. He, Oliver,
really did.

04:30.140 --> 04:32.202
And I would know
because I, Chase,

04:32.202 --> 04:33.974
am the smartest guy
in the world

04:33.974 --> 04:36.507
who comes up with
the fixes for everything.

04:36.507 --> 04:38.749
Except for this.

04:38.749 --> 04:42.012
But, you know,
I could've,
if I wanted to.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.054
But he didn't.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.155
Right.

04:45.155 --> 04:47.187
But I could've.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.889
But he didn't.

04:53.764 --> 04:57.097
See? That
wasn't so bad.

04:57.097 --> 05:01.832
You made us stop on
all 110 floors.

05:01.832 --> 05:04.535
Look, Bree,

05:04.535 --> 05:07.137
if I have the opportunity
to push a button

05:07.137 --> 05:10.140
and make it light up,
I'm gonna do it.

05:12.843 --> 05:15.185
Why is there a pig
in our hallway?

05:15.185 --> 05:19.049
I'm guessing he came into
some money on the farm.

05:19.049 --> 05:22.553
Hey, little guy,
how'd you get up here?

05:22.553 --> 05:24.595
Well, I'm sure he didn't
press every button

05:24.595 --> 05:27.227
on the elevator.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.729
Oh, Petey,
there you are.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.632
Oh, thank you for finding
my dear pet Petey.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.264
Wait. This pig
is your pet?

05:34.264 --> 05:36.507
- Yes.
- Awesome.

05:36.507 --> 05:39.269
I've always wanted
a pet pig.

05:39.269 --> 05:40.411
Look at his tail

05:40.411 --> 05:43.173
It's got a little
mind of its own.

05:43.173 --> 05:45.245
It's very nice to meet you.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.117
I'm Bree,
and this is Kaz.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.880
Oh, lovely to meet you.
I'm Mrs. Ramsey.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.252
You know, everyone's
been wondering

05:52.252 --> 05:55.055
what sort of classy people
would be moving into
the penthouse.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.887
Come on, Petey.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.228
Give me a kiss.

05:58.228 --> 05:59.790
Hit me with
that porky pucker.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.232
( laughs )

06:02.232 --> 06:05.696
Yeah, that's us.
Classiest kids in town.

06:06.997 --> 06:09.840
You must be
a pig person.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.543
Oh, now I know
this is out of the blue,

06:12.543 --> 06:14.905
but I have to visit
my daughter this weekend.

06:14.905 --> 06:16.376
Is there any chance

06:16.376 --> 06:18.779
that you'd wanna
watch Petey for me?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.251
- Of course.
- No.

06:24.154 --> 06:27.187
Kaz, we're not
pig-sitting, okay?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.189
There are already three teenage
boys in this penthouse.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.322
The last thing we need
is another disgusting animal.

06:32.322 --> 06:34.425
I'm sorry.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.667
I was unaware
you are pigaphobic.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.571
Look, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Ramsey,

06:40.571 --> 06:42.533
but you're gonna have to find
someone else to watch Petey.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.204
But it was really nice
to meet you.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.076
Oh, well.

06:46.076 --> 06:49.139
Come on, Petey.
This one doesn't like you.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.484
I'll take the elevator
down with you.

06:53.484 --> 06:55.185
How sweet.

06:55.185 --> 06:57.147
Oh, I hope you don't
mind a long ride.

06:57.147 --> 07:00.120
Petey just loves
to push all the buttons.

07:01.351 --> 07:04.294
Come on, he's perfect!

07:08.999 --> 07:11.562
I can't believe
this is really happening.

07:11.562 --> 07:14.164
I've waited so long
to get my powers back.

07:14.164 --> 07:15.466
Well, my dear,
your wait is over.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.237
The serum!

07:17.237 --> 07:19.470
It's not ready.

07:21.311 --> 07:22.773
I'm sorry. My assistant
informs me

07:22.773 --> 07:24.374
there will be
a slight delay.

07:24.374 --> 07:25.816
Can I make you
more comfortable?

07:25.816 --> 07:27.478
Would you like to put
your feet up?

07:27.478 --> 07:30.220
So you can measure
my knees again?
No, thanks.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.655
How exactly
is the serum gonna work?

07:34.655 --> 07:37.728
Well, uh, you see...

07:37.728 --> 07:40.360
the serum
will be, uh...

07:40.360 --> 07:42.192
- Injected.
- Injected...

07:42.192 --> 07:44.264
- into you, thus...
- Activating.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.396
Activating the...

07:46.396 --> 07:48.739
- Cells.
- Cells... which...

07:48.739 --> 07:51.772
Are currently dormant
but innately have
superpowers.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.774
Just trust me, Skylar,
I know what I'm doing.

07:55.506 --> 07:59.179
The serum is ready.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.582
Whoa. It's a big needle.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.614
Do you have anything
in chewable form?

08:03.614 --> 08:06.657
No. But if you prefer,

08:06.657 --> 08:08.959
I can administer
the injection.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.862
No way, Frankenstein.
This is my beautiful monster.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.267
Yeah, it's all you.

08:21.732 --> 08:23.974
Okay. There you go.

08:23.974 --> 08:25.505
( sighs )

08:25.505 --> 08:27.177
I don't feel anything.

08:27.177 --> 08:28.709
Oh, well, it will
take some time

08:28.709 --> 08:31.111
for the serum to kick in.
Right, Oliver?

08:32.543 --> 08:33.714
Oliver?

08:33.714 --> 08:36.617
Sorry. I'm a little woozy.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.620
Okay, Skylar, sit back,
relax,

08:39.620 --> 08:43.153
and the medical software
will wirelessly monitor
your vitals.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.095
Yes, and you'll have
your powers back

08:45.095 --> 08:46.426
in a matter of minutes.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.598
- Hours.
- Hours!

08:51.261 --> 08:55.205
Mm-mm. Lunch is served.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.010
And then,
after you're done,

09:00.010 --> 09:02.142
I'll draw you
a nice mud bath.

09:04.775 --> 09:07.177
- BREE: Hey, Kaz.
- Uh-oh.

09:10.821 --> 09:12.723
Hey, have you seen
my purse anywhere?

09:12.723 --> 09:15.185
Uh, no, but, um,

09:15.185 --> 09:17.928
good luck searching
everywhere but here.

09:17.928 --> 09:19.830
Eww.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.531
What are you eating?

09:21.531 --> 09:23.393
Oh, that.
That is, uh,

09:23.393 --> 09:25.135
that is my lunch.

09:25.135 --> 09:26.897
Recycled vegetables.

09:26.897 --> 09:29.299
( laughs )
Is it a carrot,
is it a beet?

09:29.299 --> 09:31.141
Who knows?

09:31.141 --> 09:33.403
Oh, that's neither.

09:33.403 --> 09:36.907
( Petey grunts )

09:36.907 --> 09:38.709
What was that?

09:38.709 --> 09:41.351
What was what?

09:41.351 --> 09:43.383
( Petey grunts )

09:43.383 --> 09:44.815
That.

09:44.815 --> 09:47.788
I was snoring.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.721
Sorry, but you're not
the most interesting person.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.264
And you're not
the most clever.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.768
Okay, it's not
what you're thinking.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.499
You brought the pig here
behind my back?

09:59.499 --> 10:01.471
Okay, it's exactly
what you're thinking.

10:01.471 --> 10:03.734
Kaz, I thought we agreed
that bringing the pig here

10:03.734 --> 10:05.906
was a bad idea.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.478
I know, but I told you,
I've always wanted a pet pig.

10:08.478 --> 10:10.641
It's just one weekend.

10:10.641 --> 10:13.644
No, I'm gonna call
Mrs. Ramsey right now
and take him back.

10:13.644 --> 10:16.847
Too late. She already left
to go on vacation to see
her daughter.

10:16.847 --> 10:20.350
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
but he's gonna have to stay
with someone else.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.923
I guess I could ask the guy
who lives downstairs.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.995
You know, the butcher.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.699
He said he would watch him.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.230
Until dinner.

10:32.302 --> 10:35.265
Okay, fine.
He can stay.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.636
( crashing )

10:38.438 --> 10:40.440
Just keep him
away from me,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.012
and clean up
that big mess.

10:42.012 --> 10:44.614
I think you mean
that pig mess.

10:46.116 --> 10:48.719
Okay, I'll go
get a mop.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.394
Good work, Petey.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.601
( squealing )

11:11.601 --> 11:14.845
Hey, you found
Bree's purse.

11:14.845 --> 11:17.577
I bet it was in the last place
you looked, right?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.179
Every time.

11:23.213 --> 11:25.555
Look what your hero
brought you.

11:25.555 --> 11:28.859
Flowers for your new
superpowers.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.391
( both screaming )

11:31.391 --> 11:33.223
What's wrong?

11:33.223 --> 11:35.395
Uh... nothing.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.328
You're just
shockingly beautiful.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.472
Like, so beautiful,
I have to look away.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.506
None of my powers
have kicked in yet.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.808
I don't think the serum
did anything.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.981
It did something.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.513
This is bad.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.585
Yeah. I mean, it'll be
a little weird

11:55.585 --> 11:56.716
being the good-looking one
in the relationship,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.588
but I'll get used to it.

11:58.588 --> 12:00.490
I'm serious.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.323
Her body is rejecting
the serum.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.556
The coal must be deteriorating
her organs from the inside out.

12:06.556 --> 12:09.760
So are you telling me
we just...

12:09.760 --> 12:12.262
Killed her.

12:21.671 --> 12:24.414
Something's wrong, Oliver.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.247
I don't feel good.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.849
Why haven't you found
the antidote yet?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.620
You're supposed
to be perfect.

12:30.620 --> 12:33.423
You know what really helps in
a high-pressure situation?

12:33.423 --> 12:35.856
You interrupting me
every five seconds

12:35.856 --> 12:37.357
to ask me why I haven't
found the antidote yet.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.559
Sorry.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.992
But have you?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.735
I knew we shouldn't
have given her coal.

12:45.735 --> 12:47.938
You gave me coal!

12:47.938 --> 12:50.040
Coal?

12:50.040 --> 12:52.602
Is that what you heard?
That would be crazy.

12:52.602 --> 12:56.206
Why would I inject you with your
one true very lethal weakness?

12:56.206 --> 12:57.808
( stammering )

12:57.808 --> 12:59.579
He did it.

13:00.911 --> 13:03.353
Okay, yes,
I was the one

13:03.353 --> 13:05.615
who suggested shocking
your system with coal,

13:05.615 --> 13:07.587
but I've also said that
you should never mix

13:07.587 --> 13:09.189
superpowers with science.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.922
- When did you say that?
- Just now. Keep up.

13:11.922 --> 13:15.926
( coughing )

13:15.926 --> 13:18.068
I must've given her
way too much.

13:18.068 --> 13:20.630
Her body's rejecting it
and expelling it as a vapor.

13:20.630 --> 13:22.432
Is it dangerous?

13:26.676 --> 13:29.109
Just to living things.

13:34.344 --> 13:36.686
Petey.

13:36.686 --> 13:38.488
Petey, you can
come out now.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.490
The butcher only wanted
to borrow a cup of sugar.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.595
Let me guess.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.127
You lost the pig?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.059
No.

13:49.059 --> 13:50.600
We were playing a game
of Hide-and-Seek,

13:50.600 --> 13:52.732
and I underestimated
his skills.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.336
Yeah, I lost the pig.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.411
Kaz, the door's open.

14:01.411 --> 14:03.343
Oh, no.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.674
Petey!

14:15.685 --> 14:17.627
Why are you looking up?

14:17.627 --> 14:21.661
You know that expression,
"when pigs fly."

14:21.661 --> 14:25.365
Yeah, and do you know
the more accurate expression,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.967
"when pigs plummet
to the street"?

14:33.803 --> 14:36.206
Petey.
You're alive.

14:37.747 --> 14:38.949
Why'd you close the door?

14:38.949 --> 14:41.411
I didn't.

14:41.411 --> 14:43.613
I think Petey did.

14:43.613 --> 14:47.117
Okay, that's ridiculous.
Pigs can't close doors.

14:47.117 --> 14:48.989
( lock activates )

14:48.989 --> 14:51.791
But apparently,
they can lock them.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.663
Okay, stand back.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.595
I'll use one of my powers
to break the glass.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.527
You can't. Chase just
reinforced all the windows.

14:57.527 --> 14:58.768
They're unbreakable.

14:58.768 --> 15:00.400
We're stuck out here

15:00.400 --> 15:02.802
unless we can get Petey
to press "unlock."

15:04.774 --> 15:06.506
- Hey, little Petey.
- Come here.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.478
( no audible sound )

15:08.478 --> 15:10.480
BREE: Come on,
you can do it.

15:18.288 --> 15:20.820
We're in luck.
Mrs. Ramsey's back early.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.653
Wait, how did
she get in?

15:23.653 --> 15:25.825
Hello!

15:25.825 --> 15:26.896
Hi. We're--

15:26.896 --> 15:28.598
Good-bye!

15:33.403 --> 15:34.634
I don't believe it.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.706
She's a thief.

15:36.706 --> 15:39.639
And Petey
is her muscle.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.313
I told you taking that pig in
was a bad idea.

15:43.313 --> 15:45.045
Okay, but to be fair,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.117
you were worried about
him making a mess,

15:47.117 --> 15:49.679
not engaging in
a pig-people
partnership to rob us!

15:55.385 --> 15:58.658
Okay, using my force field
to seal in the vapor
was a good idea.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.360
We still have enough time
to figure out an antidote.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.891
Okay, good.

16:01.891 --> 16:03.893
( Skylar coughing )

16:03.893 --> 16:05.895
Uh, Chase,
what's happening?

16:05.895 --> 16:07.767
( coughing )

16:07.767 --> 16:10.500
I thought you said your
force field was impenetrable.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.742
It is.
It's built to withstand

16:12.742 --> 16:14.874
lasers, bullets,
even atomic explosions,

16:14.874 --> 16:16.706
not alien freak gas.

16:16.706 --> 16:19.349
I told you that was
gonna happen.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.111
What? When did you
tell me that?

16:21.111 --> 16:23.713
Just now.
Keep up.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.816
If that gas escapes,
and spreads into the vents,

16:26.816 --> 16:28.188
it'll kill everyone
in the building.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.719
That's thousands
of people.

16:29.719 --> 16:31.961
I think you know
what has to be done.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.699
You're holding an electric
toothbrush; I got nothin'.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.671
No.

16:41.671 --> 16:43.773
This is a sonic de-atomizer.

16:43.773 --> 16:45.935
It'll stop the vapor
at its source

16:45.935 --> 16:47.877
by sending a lethal blast
of energy through her body.

16:47.877 --> 16:49.109
Lethal?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.541
Yes.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.543
The only way to stop
the vapor from spreading

16:53.543 --> 16:56.046
is to destroy Skylar.

16:56.046 --> 16:59.049
Absolutely not.
Give me that thing.

17:02.892 --> 17:04.354
Mine!

17:05.695 --> 17:08.027
I'm not letting you
destroy her.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.659
That girl means
everything to me.

17:09.659 --> 17:11.801
She's the reason
I wake up in the morning.

17:11.801 --> 17:13.263
I can't imagine
a life without her.

17:13.263 --> 17:15.165
( coughing )

17:15.165 --> 17:17.907
- The gas is coming out.
- I'm taking that
space witch down!

17:25.375 --> 17:27.677
( gasping )

17:27.677 --> 17:29.919
Skylar!

17:32.382 --> 17:33.953
You're okay.

17:33.953 --> 17:36.786
I'm not. That's cool.
Focus on her.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.661
And you just used one of
your superpowers.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.962
I did?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.994
I did!

17:44.994 --> 17:47.997
I guess all that vapor was just
part of the healing process.

17:47.997 --> 17:49.339
So then the serum worked.

17:49.339 --> 17:51.641
Yeah, it totally did.

17:51.641 --> 17:54.374
And it's all because of...

17:54.374 --> 17:55.945
Chase.

17:57.907 --> 18:00.850
Chase? What about me?

18:00.850 --> 18:03.082
You were about
to destroy me.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.256
What?!
No, I would never.

18:06.256 --> 18:08.158
This is, uh...
( stammering )

18:14.724 --> 18:17.667
Oh, come on.
Not my video games.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.068
You're a monster!

18:20.470 --> 18:21.831
Oh, wait.
Those are Oliver's.

18:21.831 --> 18:23.573
Never mind.

18:25.935 --> 18:27.837
Hey, Bree, what'd you do
last night?

18:27.837 --> 18:30.640
Oh, nothing. Just got fleeced
by an old lady and her pig.

18:32.842 --> 18:36.216
Hey, look.
There's an open window.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.848
I can fly up there,
sneak in and surprise 'em.

18:38.848 --> 18:41.020
- Great. What about me?
- Use your super speed.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.052
- For what?
- I don't know.

18:43.052 --> 18:46.396
I'm just trying
to make you feel useful.

18:46.396 --> 18:49.259
How about I make
my bionic kick useful?

18:57.437 --> 19:00.170
Well, that about
does it, Petey.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.442
Let's head over to
Big Sal's pawn shop

19:02.442 --> 19:05.044
on Fifth Street.

19:06.776 --> 19:07.917
You're not going anywhere.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.049
How'd you get in here?

19:10.049 --> 19:11.421
It was easy.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.323
How did you train
a pig to steal?

19:13.323 --> 19:14.954
I had to.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.026
The ferret wasn't
pulling his weight.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.030
Well, the game's over.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.732
I'm here to stop
you and Petey.

19:22.732 --> 19:26.296
Speaking of which,
where is that adorable porker?

19:26.296 --> 19:27.867
( Petey squealing )

19:37.106 --> 19:40.049
Usually, I don't roll
without my silencer.

19:40.049 --> 19:41.911
But this'll do.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.388
Oh, look,
it's a pig.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.019
Kaz, you've always
wanted a pig.

19:50.019 --> 19:51.391
She's got a gun!

19:51.391 --> 19:53.963
Look out!

19:57.967 --> 19:59.369
You guys okay?

19:59.369 --> 20:01.701
Yeah.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.033
My faith in pigs
is a bit shaken.

20:06.035 --> 20:09.279
Wait. Skylar,
did you just...

20:09.279 --> 20:11.110
Yep. I got
my powers back.

20:11.110 --> 20:15.084
Wow. Good job, man.
You finally did it.

20:15.084 --> 20:17.487
Actually, it was Chase.

20:19.449 --> 20:21.891
Oh, that's gotta sting.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.637
Can't believe I was duped
by a barnyard animal.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.839
Again.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.741
The police officer said

20:41.741 --> 20:43.613
Mrs. Ramsey's been
using the pig

20:43.613 --> 20:45.415
for over a year
to break into

20:45.415 --> 20:47.477
dozens of
high-end apartments.

20:47.477 --> 20:49.118
But now they're in custody,
all thanks to Skylar.

20:49.118 --> 20:52.251
Really we should be
thanking you.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.023
You're the guy who got
Skylar's powers back.

20:54.023 --> 20:55.785
We get it.
Chase is great.

20:55.785 --> 20:58.127
He's the best thing ever.
Everyone loves Chase.

20:58.127 --> 21:01.090
You know, I always thought
I'd be using my powers

21:01.090 --> 21:03.493
to stop an asteroid
or something,

21:03.493 --> 21:06.035
but I guess stopping a pig
from stealing video games

21:06.035 --> 21:08.067
is a close second.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.970
We should go out
to dinner to celebrate.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.142
That's a great idea, Oliver.

21:13.142 --> 21:15.645
Are you sure
it wasn't Chase's?

21:15.645 --> 21:18.308
Actually, it was.

21:20.610 --> 21:23.012
Hey. Hey, guys!

21:23.012 --> 21:25.955
Guys, what are you doing?
I'm still out here. Guys!
